If time-reversal symmetry is absent, it is possible to obtain incompressible insulating\nstates in addition to the superfluid at zero temperature. The superfluid-insulator phase transition is\nfound to be second order in type-II systems using a perturbative analysis of Cooper pairing instability\nin quantum Hall states of unpaired fermions. We obtain the pairing phase diagram as a function\nof chemical potential (density) and temperature. However, a more careful analysis presented here\nreveals that the pairing quantum phase transition is always preempted by another transition into a\nstrongly correlated normal state which retains Cooper pairing and cannot be smoothly connected\nto the quantum Hall state of unpaired fermions. Such a normal phase can be qualitatively viewed\nas a liquid of vortices, although it may acquire conventional broken symmetries. Even if it did not\nsurvive at finite temperatures its influence would be felt through strong quantum fluctuations below\na crossover temperature scale. These conclusions directly apply to fermionic ultra-cold atom systems\nnear unitarity, but are likely relevant for the properties of other strongly correlated superfluids as\nwell, including high temperature superconductors.\n\nMany years of efforts to understand the strongly correlated phases of cuprate superconductors and other unconventional materials have resulted in a variety of new\nconceptual ideas. One broadly accepted idea is that the\ndestruction of two-dimensional superconductivity in underdoped cuprates involves strong fluctuations of the order parameter instead of Cooper pair dissociation1 . The\nremarkable theoretical insight gained from duality transformations in several systems2,3 stimulates viewing this\nphase transition as a proliferation of vortices. The normal state may be envisioned as a liquid of mobile vortex loops. Indeed, there are several experimental observations that support this view4,5 , and several theories\nthat exploit it6,7 to successfully explain certain unconventional properties of cuprates8\u201312 .\nNevertheless, the notion of a vortex liquid is not a trivial one. It is not even clear yet whether any correlated\nstate of any known material truly deserves to be called\na vortex liquid. In particular, the vortex liquid regime\nfound in the pseudogap region in cuprates seems to be\nseparated from the high temperature normal state only\nby a crossover. A quantum vortex liquid might be a\ngenuine phase at zero temperature which influences the\nfinite temperature dynamics13,14 . A few theoretical models can reliably describe strongly correlated phases that\ncan be characterized as vortex liquids, and they provide\nthe best route to precisely define and characterize these\nphases14\u201316 .\nA new platform for addressing these interesting challenges in many-body physics has been recently introduced in atomic physics17 . The ability to condense\nultra-cold fermionic atoms into a superfluid with controllable strength of interactions and study them as virtually ideal and clean systems has already mobilized an effort to simulate condensed matter systems. Static threedimensional cold-atom systems near a broad Feshbach\nresonance have striking universal properties17\u201320 which\n\nmake them amenable to field theoretical analysis. This\nuniversality is controlled by a quantum critical point at\nthe zero density Feshbach resonance19 , which defines the\nunitarity limit. The superfluid in this regime interpolates\nbetween the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state of\nCooper pairs and Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of diatomic molecules, and insulating states in optical lattices\ninterpolate between the two analogous limits of band\nand Mott insulators respectively21 . The cold-atom superfluids can be destabilized by fast rotation in the same\nway the electronic superconductor can be destabilized by\nmagnetic field22\u201324 . Experimental progress toward observing this effect in cold atoms is still limitted, but the\noverall pace of development in the field gives many reasons for optimism25\u201327 .\nIn this paper we analyze a simple two-dimensional\nmodel of interacting fermionic particles which is a significant simplification of electronic systems such as cuprates\nin magnetic field, but can be routinely and accurately\nrealized using rotating ultra-cold atoms. The model\ncontains paired superfluids at low temperatures and a\nnormal phase of uncorrelated fermions at high temperatures. We concentrate on type-II superfluids which\nhost an Abrikosov vortex lattice due to the absence of\ntime-reversal symmetry. The uncorrelated normal phase\nis a thermally excited quantum Hall state of unpaired\nfermions. A characteristic phase diagram of pairing instability in this normal phase is shown in Fig.1. One of\nour main results is that the normal phase can stretch all\nthe way to zero temperature at finite particle densities\nfor certain strengths of interactions between fermions.\nThe pairing instability depicted in Fig.1 was examined\nin the past by several authors; for a review see28 and\nreferences therein. While three-dimensional systems attracted most attention in the literature, the focus here\nis on two-dimensions precisely because of the previously\nmissed zero-temperature normal states (they are not ex-\n\n\f2\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\nFIG. 1: Critical temperature of the superfluid-normal pairing\ntransition as a function of chemical potential.

In this paper we\nprovide a fresh approach to issues such as superconductivity in high magnetic fields and keep the formalism simple and clear in order to focus on the most fundamental\nquestions. This simplicity will allow us to reach some fundamental conclusions which were obscured in the past by\nthe inability to go beyond the mean-field and other approximations. We will not consider Zeeman effect in this\npaper; Zeeman pair-breaking effects can be completely\neliminated in cold-atom systems, while in electronic systems they are certainly important although the superconducting state may be able to survive them even in\nhigh magnetic fields (this analysis will be published separately). Another popular approach in the literature has\nbeen the Landau-Ginzburg theory, but for our purposes\nit is important to take into account the internal structure\nof the bosonic degrees of freedom responsible for superfluidity and capture phenomena characteristic for fermionic\nsuperfluids that are absent in pure bosonic systems and\nLandau-Ginzburg theories.\nThe possibility of finding a zero-temperature normal\nphase of unpaired fermions, which is actually a quantum Hall insulator, provides an opportunity to establish with physical rigor the existence of another nonsuperfluid phase at zero temperature. We show that the\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) A schematic phase diagram at zero\ntemperature. The depicted phases are fermionic quantum\nHall insulator (QHI), vortex liquid (VL) and superfluid with\nan Abrikosov vortex lattice (SF). The vertical axis is a measure of the attractive interaction strength between fermions.\nThe horizontal axis in is fermion chemical potential expressed\nin reference to a Landau level (\u03c9c is cyclotron frequency; the\nleft and right edge of the diagram correspond to two neighboring Landau levels). In the weak pairing limit the superfluid can be destabilized between Landau levels, forming a\nvortex liquid across a first order phase transition. For very\nweak pairing interactions a quantum Hall insulator of unpaired fermions might become stable across a transition such\nas the one discussed in Ref.24 . The particle densities in VL\nand QHI are expected to be fixed and commensurate with\nrespect to magnetic area. In this paper we find integer QHI\nstates shown in Fig.1 and the corresponding VL states around\nthem. Other insulating states such as fractional bosonic and\nfermionic quantum Hall states can be expected in various circumstances.\n\nzero-temperature superfluid at a finite density must be\ndestroyed by the quantum fluctuations of the order parameter before the depairing instability occurs. This vortex\nlattice melting quantum phase transition is expected to\nbe first order29\u201331 , although proposals for a second order\ntransition have also been made32 . The resulting normal\nphase is strongly correlated as it retains Cooper pairs,\nand it cannot be smoothly connected with the quantum\nHall state of unpaired fermions. Quantum phase transitions between the two kinds of normal phases have been\nstudied recently24 . We will refer to the new normal phase\nas vortex liquid, based on its sharp distinction from the\nfermionic quantum Hall states. A schematic phase diagram is shown in Fig.2.\nThe concrete properties of a vortex liquid and its stability at finite temperatures are not addressed in this\npaper. The main reason is that these properties are\nnot universal in generic realistic systems. To make this\npoint we use a renormalization group analysis and show\nthat all possible interactions are relevant at the Gaussian fixed point in two dimensions, regardless of their\nspatial dependence or the number of colliding particles.\nThe existence of infinitely many relevant directions in the\n\n\f3\nparameter space suggests the possible existence of a large\nnumber of stable interacting fixed points which determine\nthe properties of phases. Which of these phases is realized in a particular realistic system is highly sensitive to\nthe microscopic details of interactions between particles.\nOne prominent candidate in the case of short-range interactions is a quantum Hall liquid of incoherent Cooper\npairs24 . Other possibilities include a conventional broken symmetry such as a density wave, in which case its\nalgebraically correlated analogue could exist as a stable\nphase at finite temperatures.\nSince the ultra-cold fermionic atoms near unitarity are\nthe closest realization of the model considered here, we\nwill devote extra attention to their specifics and express\nthe results in scales natural to cold atoms. However, the\nanalysis is general and possibly relevant to other strongly\ncorrelated systems such as cuprates.\nThis paper is organized into several sections. We begin\nby defining the model of interest in section A and setting up the formalism for perturbation theory. In section\nB we analyze the phase diagram of the Cooper pairing\ntransition in the perturbation theory. The interpretation\nand limitations of the perturbative results are outlined in\nsection C. In section D we establish that vortex liquid\nphases, missed by the naive perturbation theory, exist at\nzero temperature. At the end, we apply a renormalization group analysis in section E to appreciate the nonuniversal properties of the vortex liquid states and the\nrichness of its possible physical realizations. We summarize the results and discuss a possible experimental\napproach in the concluding section F.\nA.\n\nwhen interactions are strong. The physical case of interest is N = 1. The attractive interactions between particles are decoupled in the particle-particle channel by the\nHubbard-Stratonovich field \u03a6. These interactions lead to\nprocesses in which two colliding particles are annihilated\nand recreated at a different location and different time,\nso that we can view \u03a6 as a mediating Cooper pair field.\nNo particular assumptions are made about the nature or\nrange of interactions at this point, so we leave the bosonic\nkernel \u03a0\u03020 unspecified until the next section.\nIt is worthwhile noting that in cold-atom systems the\ngauge field A is rigid and cannot be expelled from a superfluid because it captures the inertial forces in the rotating frame of reference. As a consequence, cold atom\nsuperfluids are automatically type-II. In contrast, A is\ndynamical in electronic systems and the type of a superconductor is determined by various parameters not\ncontained in this model, such as disorder.\nThe action is formally a generalization of the \"twochannel\" model to the Sp(N ) symmetry group. The purpose of this generalization is to systematically organize\na perturbation theory with 1/N as a small parameter\neven when interactions are not weak, as will be the case\nthroughout the paper. We first note that the full Cooper\npair propagator is proportional to 1/N . This follows from\nthe Dyson equation whose solution can be represented\nusing Feynman diagrams:\n\n(3)\n\nThe model\n\nOur starting point is a generic model of fermionic particles with attractive interactions in two dimensions. We\ncouple the particles to a U(1) gauge field which implements a uniform flux density B:\n\u2207 \u00d7 A = \u1e91B = \u1e91m\u03c9c = \u1e912m\u03c9 .\n\n(1)\n\nIn electronic materials flux is created by the external\nmagnetic field B, while in ultra-cold atom systems it originates in rotation at angular velocity \u03c9 (the relationship\nabove follows from dynamics in the rotating frame of reference). We will not consider the fluctuations of A, so\nthat the model will naturally describe neutral particles\n(although Coulomb forces can be implemented as direct\ninteractions).

The full vertex represented by a shaded dot,\nand the full fermion propagator are obtained by dressing\nthe bare vertex and propagator with full Cooper pair lines\nfrom the left-hand-side, and this generates contributions\nat higher orders in 1/N . In general, any physical observable will formally be expressed as an expansion in powers\nof 1/N , justifying perturbation theory for any interaction\nstrength in the limit of large N . This is a semi-classical\nexpansion because for N = \u221e all pairing fluctuations\nare suppressed and saddle-point approximations become\nexact.\nThe uncorrelated Gaussian state to which the pairing interactions are added as perturbations is an integer\nquantum Hall state of fermions. This state is hard to\nimagine as a ground state of any interacting system because of its macroscopically Landau-degenerate spectra.\nNevertheless, it is a good starting point at sufficiently\nhigh temperatures, and its usefulness at zero temperature\nwill become apparent in section D.\nThe bare fermionic states are Landau orbitals with en-\n\n\f4\n\nfermion\n\n1\n\u2212i\u03c9m + \u01ebn\n\nCooper pair\n\n\u03a0\u03020\n\nvertex\n\n\u0393n\nm1 ,m2\n\n\u0012\n\nk\n\u221a\nB\n\n\u0013\n\nTABLE I: Bare elements of the perturbation theory in Landau\nrepresentation.

Their dynamics is captured by the Cooper\n\npair propagator D\u0302 = (N \u03a0\u0302)\u22121 . In general, we need to\nview this propagator as an operator, or a matrix whose\nrows and columns are indexed by the quantum numbers of Cooper pairs in some representation. We do not\nknow a priori which representation diagonalizes \u03a0\u0302, but\nthe Landau representation is a convenient one to work\nwith. Since pairing instability occurs at zero frequency,\nthe easiest way to detect it is by the onset of negative\neigenvalues of \u03a0\u0302 at zero Matsubara frequency. This follows from the fact that upon integrating out the fermion\nfields in (2) the effective Cooper pair action has the\nquadratic term \u03a6\u2020 \u03a0\u0302\u03a6 which needs to be positive for any\nvector \u03a6 if the perturbation theory about the normal\nstate (\u03a6 = 0) were to be stable.\nBefore embarking on the calculation of \u03a0\u0302 we must note\nthat it is not gauge invariant. Gauge transformations\nin position representation that leave the action invariant\nare:\nA(r) \u2192 A(r) + \u2207\u03bb(r)\n\n\u03c8i\u03b1 (r) \u2192 \u03c8i\u03b1 (r)e\n\n(7)\n\ni\u03bb(r)\n\n\u03a6(r) \u2192 \u03a6(r)ei2\u03bb(r)\n\n\u03a0(r 1 , r2 ) \u2192 \u03a0(r 1 , r2 )ei[2\u03bb(r 1 )\u22122\u03bb(r2 )]\nGauge transformations are manifestly unitary transformations of \u03a0\u0302 and do not affect its spectrum of eigenvalues. Therefore, the spectrum which contains all information about bosonic dynamics is gauge invariant and the\ncalculations can safely proceed in any gauge choice. Note\nthat if the gauge field were dynamic one would not be\nable to apply the standard perturbation theory in powers of charge because the gauge transformations would\nappear non-perturbative. That problem is absent in our\napproach.\nThe Cooper pair kernel \u03a0\u0302 can be viewed as a sum of\ntwo parts according to (3). The first part is the bare kernel \u03a0\u03020 which contains information about the microscopic\ndetails of the attractive interactions between fermions.\nThe second part is the fermion bubble diagram which\ncan be derived as an expansion in 1/N :\n\u221a X Z dk f (\u03b5m1 ) \u2212 f (\u2212\u03b5m2 )\n\u03a0\u2032n,n\u2032 (p, i\u03a9) = B\n2\u03c0 \u2212i\u03a9 + \u03b5m1 + \u03b5m2\nm1 ,m2\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nk\nk\n1\nn\u2032\n\u221a\n\u221a\n.

The lowest order term, explicitly written here with the internal Matsubara frequency\nsummed up, contains only the bare fermion propagators\nand no vertex corrections.\nAs we will discuss in section E, different microscopic\ndetails of attractive interactions between fermions can in\nprinciple lead to different properties of the system. Without being able to classify all possible cases we still have\nto choose a particular form of interactions in order to\n\n\f5\ncarry out calculations. The simplest choice is to model\nshort-range interactions by a zero-range potential. The\nHubbard-Stratonovich decoupling of such attractive interactions produces \u03a0\u03020 = const.:\n\u001a Z\n\u001b\nV\n\u2020\n\u2020\nexp\nd\u03c4 d2 r\u03c8i\u2191\n(r)\u03c8i\u2193\n(r)\u03c8j\u2193 (r)\u03c8j\u2191 (r)\n(9)\nN\n( Z\n\"\nZ\nN\n2\n|\u03a6(r)|2\n\u221d D\u03a6 exp \u2212 d\u03c4 d r\nV\n#)\n\u2020\n\u2020\n+ \u03a6\u2020 (r)\u03c8i\u2191 (r)\u03c8i\u2193 (r) + \u03a6(r)\u03c8i\u2193\n(r)\u03c8i\u2191\n(r)\n\n.\n\nIn three dimensions and zero flux density the constant\n\u03a0\u03020 = V \u22121 is related to the scattering length of two body\ncollisions in vacuum: \u03a0\u03020 = m\u03bd/4\u03c0, where a = \u22121/\u03bd is\nthe scattering length. In the context of cold atom experiments, \u03bd is the detuning from the Feshbach resonance.\nFor \u03bd = 0 the scattering length diverges and the system\nacquires universal properties, which is the so called unitarity regime where microscopic details of interactions do\nnot matter and the simple interaction potential above is\nsufficient for making various quantitative predictions. In\ntwo dimensions we must redefine the detuning in order\nfor \u03a0\u03020 to have proper engineering dimensions: we replace\n\u03bd by \u03bde = \u03bdaz , where az is a confinement length-scale or\n\"width\" of the potential well in z-direction which effectively reduces the system to two dimensions.\nWhile establishing these connections with cold-atom\nsystems is useful, one should be aware of the conceptual\nproblems in the presence of finite flux density. Strictly\nspeaking, scattering length a is a quantity that describes\ninteractions between extended free particles, but in our\ncase particles are localized in Landau orbitals. Only for\na \u226a Rc , the cyclotron radius at Fermi energy, a retains\nits physical meaning. Therefore, it is most appropriate\nto regard \u03bd = \u22121/a just as a measure of the strength\nof interactions, positive values being the BCS limit and\nnegative values being the BEC limit. Interpreting \u03bd = 0\nas a Feshbach resonance in cold-atom systems and ascribing universal properties to it is problematic, and the\ndiscussion in section E will shed more light on this.\nIn fact, the relationship between \u03a0\u03020 and scattering\nlength is established only after the regularization of the\ninfra-red and ultra-violet behavior of \u03a0\u0302. In three dimensions and without the external flux the \u03a0\u0302 given by the\nexpression analogous to (8) is known to be ultra-violet\ndivergent. Once this field-theoretical artifact is removed\nby regularization, the leftover contribution to \u03a0\u0302 is precisely m\u03bd/4\u03c0 19 . In two dimensions \u03a0\u0302 becomes infra-red\ndivergent as well if the bare fermion spectrum is gapless.\nIn our case the spectrum is gapped due to Landau level\nquantization, but more generally any two-dimensional\nsystem should be viewed as a three-dimensional system\nconstrained by a potential well in which the lowest energy\nband is raised above the bottom of the well. Therefore,\ninfra-red divergence is not a real concern. The ultraviolet behavior is, however, very different from the zero\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) Critical temperature for the onset of\nCooper pairing as a function of chemical potential for several values of dimensionless detuning \u03bde = \u03bdaz : the outermost curve is BEC limit \u03bde = \u22120.9, the innermost is BCS\nlimit \u03bde = +0.9, unitarity \u03bd = 0 is dashed (\u2206e\n\u03bd = 0.1).

On physical grounds we perform\nregularization by subtracting from (8) the same expression \u03a0\u0302\u2032 (0) evaluated at zero Matsubara frequency and\nmomentum transfer, as well as zero temperature and\nchemical potential, but finite flux density. This takes\ncare of any possible ultra-violet divergencies and is compensated by adding me\n\u03bd /4\u03c0 which in the limit of small\nscattering length is precisely given by \u03a0\u0302\u2032 (0).

The numerical calculation of (8)\ninvolves the first 500 fermionic Landau levels below the\ncut-off and the lowest bosonic Landau level, although the\nphase diagram remains the same if higher bosonic Landau levels n, n\u2032 are included. The deeper one goes into the\nBEC regime, the faster the growth of critical temperature\nwith chemical potential (density). In the BCS regime,\nhowever, the paired phase breaks up into dome-shaped\nislands at low densities, obtained when chemical potential gets close to a fermionic Landau level. Once a paired\nstate becomes a connected region at sufficiently large\ndensities, there are trailing islands of unpaired states sitting between the Landau levels. These details are shown\nwith more clarity in Fig.1. Related phenomena have been\nconsidered in literature, but the zero temperature normal\nstates were not anticipated28 .\n\n\f6\nInteger quantum Hall states are obtained by putting\nthe chemical potential \u03bc between Landau levels. Pairing interactions compete with the cyclotron gap \u03c9c = 2\u03c9\nand must be strong enough in comparison to the smallest single-particle gap min{|\u03bc \u2212 \u03c9c (n + 12 )|, n \u2208 Z} in\norder to give rise to Cooper pairing. This means that\nif pairing is not too strong, insulating states can exist\nat zero temperature with fully populated Landau levels\nbelow the chemical potential. The analysis based on pairing instability in the perturbation theory is, however, not\ncomplete. In the next two sections we discuss what has\nbeen missed.\nC.\n\nLimitations of the perturbation theory\n\nThe perturbation theory seemingly discovers Cooper\npairing instability for any finite N when the chemical\npotential is brought sufficiently close to a Landau level.\nTo cure this instability one usually redefines the groundstate by introducing an order parameter and then rebuilds the perturbation theory about the new groundstate. The order parameter which describes a superfluid\nwith broken U(1) symmetry and an Abrikosov lattice of\nvortices can be written as a superposition of Landau level\nwavefunctions in (5):\nX Z dp\n\u03a60 (r) =\n\u03c6n,p \u03a6n,p (r) .\n(11)\n2\u03c0\nn\nHence, the order parameter is specified by multiple amplitudes \u03c6n,p . If we substitute \u03a6(r) = \u03a60 (r) + \u03b4\u03a6(r)\nin (2) and integrate out the fluctuating fields \u03c8 and \u03b4\u03a6\nwe can obtain the perturbative 1/N expansion for free\nenergy density of the ansatz state characterized by \u03a60 :\nF (\u03a60 )\nF0\nj\ni\u2217 j\u2217 k l\n6\n=\n+ \u03a0\u0302ij \u03a6i\u2217\n0 \u03a60 + \u00dbijkl \u03a60 \u03a60 \u03a60 \u03a60 + O(\u03a6 ) .\nN\nN\n(12)\nThe quantum numbers (n, p) are represented by indices\ni, j . . . for brevity, and all couplings \u03a0\u0302, \u00db . . . are functions of \u03bc, T, \u03c9 . . . which have tensor structure and contributions to all powers of 1/N . Note that the expansion\nis analytic at \u03a60 = 0 because the unperturbed state at\n\u03a60 = 0 is a fully gapped incompressible quantum Hall\nstate of unpaired fermions. In the normal state F is minimized at \u03a60 = 0, while in the superfluid the minimum\nis at \u03a60 6= 0.\nAt the lowest order or the mean-field level we found\nboth superfluid and normal states in the previous section. If we include higher order corrections the order\nparameter in a superfluid state will be reduced and the\nnormal areas in the phase diagram will grow. However,\nsuperfluid states will survive at all orders of perturbation theory for any finite N if the chemical potential is\nsufficiently close to a Landau level. This is ultimately a\nconsequence of the cyclotron gap in the fermion spectrum\nwhich prevents the occurrence of non-analytic infra-red\nfeatures and yields finite corrections to all couplings in\n\n(12) at all orders of 1/N . Alternatively, any point in the\nphase diagram which is a superfluid in the mean-field approximation will remain superfluid for sufficiently large\nN despite fluctuations.\nThroughout this paper we exploit the computational\nand analytical convenience of the physical picture embodied in (12). However, we must be aware of its limitations.\nThis picture naively suggests two kinds of broken symmetries in the superfluid phase, the \"off-diagonal\" longrange order and space-group symmetry breaking due to\nthe vortex lattice. Even at finite temperatures it suggests the existence of these broken symmetries. On the\nother hand, it is well known that fluctuations in twodimensional systems can restore continuous symmetries\nin the equilibrium states. In particular, the superfluid\nphase at zero temperature has a long-range ordered vortex lattice, but shear fluctuations of vortex positions reduce the \"off-diagonal\" order to algebraic correlations\nand hence restore the U(1) symmetry33\u201335 . At finite\ntemperatures even the vortex lattice must be melted according to Mermin-Wagner theorem, but algebraic correlations of vortex positions are allowed and KosterlitzThouless transitions can separate the quasi long-range\nordered vortex \"lattice\" phases from disordered phases\nwith only short-range correlations.\nThe naive approach behind the Eq.12 assumes that\nthe only two kinds of states one needs to worry about\nare the normal state with short-range correlations of the\norder parameter, and the superfluid with long-range correlations. It does not explore the free energy density F \u2032\nof states with algebraic correlations of the order parameter(s). It turns out that in the circumstances mentioned above F \u2032 < F (\u03a60 ) for any attempted order parameter \u03a60 inside the naively predicted superfluid regions.\nAnother possibility is that F \u2032 < F (0) inside some parts\nof the naively predicted normal states.\nCalculating F \u2032 is highly non-trivial in the perturbation\ntheory. Therefore, we are better off learning what we can\nfrom F (\u03a60 ) in (12). The difference \u2206 = F (\u03a60 ) \u2212 F \u2032 defines an energy scale associated with the error made by\n(12). We will be able to make conclusions only about\nphenomena characterized by energies larger than \u2206, or\nlength-scales smaller than \u03b4 \u221d \u2206\u22121 . This will be sufficient for establishing the existence of zero temperature\nvortex liquid phases in the next section. On general\ngrounds we can expect that the error \u2206 is small because\neven in the absence of a true long range order the scale\ngiven by \u03a60 plays a role in various properties of the system.\n\nD.\n\nVortex liquid\n\nThe quantum Hall insulator of unpaired fermions is a\nvery peculiar unperturbed state for building the perturbation theory. A very important property of the exact\nCooper pair propagator D\u0302 = (N \u03a0\u0302)\u22121 in this state is\nthat its spectrum is macroscopically degenerate and cor-\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 4: Feynman diagram labeling examples.\n\nresponds to bosonic Landau level degeneracy. A simple\nargument is that in the absence of any emerging parameters that could characterize the equilibrium state the\npropagator D\u0302 obtains its matrix structure from the only\nsingle-particle operator available in the theory (2), the\ncanonical momentum P = \u2212i\u2207 \u2212 A. This operator has\na degenerate spectrum that gives rise to Landau level\ndegeneracy, hence the operator D\u0302(P ) must also have a\ndegenerate spectrum, assuming of course that the functional dependence on P is analytic. A detailed demonstration of this fact follows from perturbation theory to\nall orders, and agrees with a general expectation that\nthe perturbation theory describes a state smoothly connected to the state of non-interacting particles in the absence of instabilities. It is important to note here that\nCooper pairs are \"charged\" with respect to the gauge\nfield; \"charge-neutral\" particle-hole excitations are exempt from the Landau-level quantization.\nThe perturbative argument goes like this. We can establish that (8) and hence (10) are independent of p to\nall orders of 1/N . First, the written lowest order term in\nthe 1/N expansion involves fermion energies that do not\ndepend on \u00b1k + p/2, and vertices (6) that do not depend on p. This term defines the bare boson propagator\nD0 \u221d N \u22121 , using which we generate higher order corrections of (8). Let us apply the following labeling rules\nin all Feynman diagrams that contribute to (10): each\nfermion propagator shall carry momentum k + p/2 in the\narrow direction, while each boson propagator shall carry\nq + p (see Fig.4). The transfer of p is automatically conserved. Each added vertex takes momenta k1 + p/2 and\nk2 + p/2 at its fermionic terminals, but there is no dependence on p since only the difference of momenta at the\nfermion terminals matters in (6). The added bare boson\nlines take p contributions, but according to (8) they do\nnot depend on the transferred momentum. Therefore,\norder by order, no dependence on p is introduced in any\nFeynman diagram.\nChanging the nature of interactions does not modify\nthis conclusion because \u03a0\u03020 must be gauge invariant in\nthe presence of the external uniform flux density. Even\ninteractions in the particle-hole channel cannot lift the\ndegeneracy of bosonic modes (an equivalent \"degeneracy\ntheorem\" can be proved to all perturbative orders in a\nLandau-Ginzburg theory of interacting particles in magnetic field). Therefore, the gapped two-particle bosonic\nmodes are macroscopically degenerate in the trivial insulating state regardless of the type of interactions between\nparticles. Naturally, it is hard to believe that any quan-\n\ntum fluctuations would not lift this degeneracy. At no\nsurprise we shall demonstrate that the degeneracy must\nbe lifted at least close to the superfluid transition, but\nthe main point for now is that it takes spontaneous reorganization of the ground-state to lift the degeneracy\n(which in some sense is a trivial but very important observation). Even without knowing whether the obtained\nnormal T = 0 state has some conventional order or topological order, it is certain that it cannot be smoothly\nconnected with the ordinary insulating state.\nFirst, we need to understand the properties of the zero\ntemperature superfluid phase. Let us start from a quantum Hall insulator at zero temperature. When the energy\nof the lowest degenerate bosonic states in the insulator\nbecomes negative in response to the chemical potential\napproaching a Landau level, then Cooper pairs condense\ninto those states. The resulting order that minimizes free\nenergy density is automatically an Abrikosov vortex lattice residing initially just in the lowest bosonic Landau\nlevel. The free energy cost of rearranging vortices without changing the vortex density is exceptionally small\nnear the phase transition. By assumption we are dealing\nwith type-II superfluids so that the pairing phase transition is second order. But, even more striking is the effect\nof bosonic degeneracy in the trivial insulating phase.\nConsider the free energy density as a function of order parameter in (12). We argued that the quadratic\ncoupling \u03a0\u0302 is macroscopically degenerate. Therefore, different vortex lattice arrangements, specified by different\norder parameters \u03a60 , will differ in free energy only as\nO(\u03a640 ) close to the phase transition. We conclude that\nthe potential energy density of a vortex lattice depends\non the order parameter near the transition as:\nEpot \u223c \u03a640 .\n\n(13)\n\nQuantum fluctuations of the order parameter dynamically distort the vortex lattice. Their microscopic origin are the short-range repulsive interactions between\nCooper pairs which are caused at least by the Pauli exclusion of their fermionic constituents. Interactions between\nbare fermions also affect the quantum fluctuations in a\nmanner that can be very sensitive to microscopic details\nof the interaction potential. In fact, all possible twobody and multi-particle interactions are relevant at the\nGaussian fixed point in the renormalization group sense,\nregardless of their spatial dependence (see next section).\nHaving infinitely many relevant directions in the parameter space suggests that there could be many interacting stable fixed points that describe numerous possible\ncorrelated phases. Systematically analyzing all possibilities seems hopeless. Therefore, we shall not attempt\nto identify the properties of strongly correlated normal\nphases that can be obtained after the superfluid is destroyed by quantum fluctuations. Instead, we can at least\nprove that some strongly correlated normal phase must\ninherit the superfluid, rather than the trivial unpaired\nquantum Hall insulator. This is already one statement\n\n\f8\nabout the renormalization group flow of parameters near\nthe superfluid quantum phase transition.\nIn order to summarize the effects of quantum fluctuations we can view them as quantum motion of vortices.\nIn this picture, vortex lattice melting destroys the superfluid. It will suffice to estimate the effective vortex mass\nMv , specifically its dependence on the order parameter\n\u03a60 . We make the estimate using the Heissenberg uncertainty relation. Vortices are localized in a vortex lattice\n\u221a\nat the scales of magnetic length lm = 1/ m\u03c9c which\nmeasures the average distance between vortices and cor\u221a\nresponds to a momentum scale pm \u223c m\u03c9c . If vortices\nwere allowed to move freely they could convert the potential energy of localization in the lattice to kinetic energy\nof the order of p2m /2Mv per vortex. Since vortex density is topologically fixed by the constant rotation rate\nor magnetic field, we find:\nEkin \u223c Mv\u22121 (\u03a60 ) .\n\n(14)\n\nIn typical fermionic superfluids one is usually mostly\nconcerned with the quasiparticle contribution to vortex\nmass. In s-wave superfluids vortex cores can localize\nquasiparticles, so that Mv is at least of the order of the\ntotal mass of trapped core fermions. An upper bound for\nMv can be found by viewing a vortex core as a potential\nwell of depth |\u03a60 | in the units of energy, and radius comparable to the Cooper pair coherence length \u03be \u223c |\u03a60 |\u22121 .\nAssuming roughly a constant density of core states appropriate for two-dimensional non-relativistic quasiparticles, the total number of core states is proportional to\n|\u03a60 |, so that Mv . |\u03a60 |. This estimate is best suited for\nthe strong BCS limit36 . As the strength of interactions is\nincreased, the coherence length decreases, quasiparticles\nare gradually being expelled from vortex cores and Mv is\nbeing reduced. There is also a contribution of extended\nquasiparticles to vortex mass. In s-wave superfluids this\ncontribution is thermally activated, but in d-wave superfluid it gives rise to a vortex mass of the order of a fermion\nmass37 .\nClose to the superfluid transition it turns out that the\n\"hydrodynamic\" vortex mass due to the phase fluctuations of the order parameter dominates in Mv (for any finite N ). This contribution can be generally estimated as\nMv \u223c \u01ebv /c2 , where \u01ebv is energy of a static vortex and c is\nthe speed of sound, or the superfluid critical velocity37,39 .\nFor a neutral\np superfluid with stiffness \u03c1s in the units of\nenergy, c \u223c \u03c1s /m while \u01ebv \u221d \u03c1s log(lm /\u03be) diverges logarithmically with the separation lm between vortices. The\nlogarithmic behavior comes from the contribution of the\ncirculating supercurrent phase gradients that extend beyond the vortex core of radius \u03be freely up to the distance\nto the neighboring vortices (we assumed that the London\npenetration length is larger than the magnetic length lm ).\nUsing \u03c1s \u223c |\u03a60 |2 we find that the hydrodynamic contribution to the vortex mass behaves as Mv \u223c log |\u03a60 | near\nthe phase transition for a fixed flux density. In charged\nsuperfluids the logarithmic factor is screened-out37,40 , so\nthat the vortex mass approaches a constant as |\u03a60 | \u2192 0.\n\nTherefore, the vortex kinetic energy density is:\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u22121\n|log |\u03a60 ||\n, neutral superfluid\n.

The quantum melting occurs at a finite |\u03a60 |\nbelow which Ekin > Epot , before the depairing transition is reached. Both the kinetic and potential energy\nof vortices can be calculated in the perturbation theory,\nand the melting transition is expected to be first order\naccording to the Landau-Ginzburg theory of phase transitions. The resulting normal state can be regarded a\nstrongly correlated vortex liquid in which Cooper pairs\nremain the most important low energy degrees of freedom. The energy released into the motion of vortices in\nthe vortex liquid is not sufficient to overcome the pairing\ngap |\u03a60 | in the fermion spectrum.\nBy comparing the spectrum of bosonic excitations in\nthis vortex liquid and the trivial quantum Hall insulator\none easily concludes that the two normal phases cannot\nbe smoothly connected. The bosonic modes in the superfluid state close to the pairing transition are nearly degenerate, so that many different vortex arrangements have\nvery similar free energy densities. In the trivial quantum\nHall insulator all of these modes become gapped and collapse to the same bosonic Landau level, leaving the occupied fermionic Landau levels to define the ground-state.\nOn the other hand, vortex liquid is obtained by mixing\nthe nearly-degenerate bosonic modes inside the superfluid, while they still have negative energies that encourage condensation. The mixing perturbation produces a\nnew ground-state (with lower energy than the superfluid)\nas a quantum superposition of many different vortex arrangements and pushes away from it the other collective\nmodes toward higher energies. The resulting low energy\nspectrum is qualitatively different than that of the trivial\nquantum Hall insulator because the ground-state is still a\ncollective state of correlated bosons at some negative energy where condensation is prevented only due to strong\nquantum fluctuations.\nWe cannot predict the properties of the vortex liquid,\nand they are not universal. However, the perturbation\ntheory requires that a vortex liquid be adjacent to any\ntype-II superfluid phase of a two-dimensional quantum\nfermionic system at zero temperature with explicitly broken time-reversal symmetry. How should this be interpreted in the light of the fact that the naive perturbation theory does not correctly describe the lowest energy\nscales? Even though quantum fluctuations destroy the\nsuperfluid long-range order, they leave behind the broken symmetries due to the vortex lattice. The vortex\nlattice potential energy (13) is shaped by quasiparticle and Cooper pair mediated forces between vortices,\nwhich in turn are well defined at sufficiently short lengthscales to be captured by the naive perturbation theory.\nSpecifically, close to the pairing transition when the error\n\n\f9\nlength-scale \u03b4 becomes large in comparison with the separation lm between vortices the naive estimate (13) can\nbe trusted. Similarly, vortex mass is always dominated\nby the \"high energy\" degrees of freedom below the ultraviolet cut-off associated with the finite vortex core size, or\nthe superconducting \"gap\". Vortex is a local deformation\nof superfluid phases so that its dynamics can be reliably\ncaptured by the naive perturbation theory. Therefore,\nwe can trust the estimate (15) as well and establish the\nexistence of a vortex liquid at zero temperature.\nE.\n\nRenormalization group analysis\n\nThe purpose of the following discussion is to elucidate\nthe issues behind attempts to apply the simple theory\n(2) to the analysis of realistic systems. A usual theoretical strategy is to justify a tractable field theory in the\nvicinity of second-order phase transitions where most op-\n\nerators allowed by symmetries do not significantly affect\nthe macroscopically observable properties of the system.\nThe fact that only a few operators are important to keep\nin calculations is what makes a field theory quantitatively\nuseful. The model (2) does not have this useful property.\nWe demonstrate using renormalization group (RG)\nthat all arbitrary-range interactions between fermions are\nperturbations to (2) that can shape phases and induce\ntransitions. Physically, this comes from the fact that the\nbare fermion spectrum in (2) consists of dispersionless\nmacroscopically degenerate Landau levels with energies\n\u01ebn = n\u03c9c \u2212\u03bc\u2032 (here we measure energy with respect to the\nredefined chemical potential \u03bc\u2032 = \u03bc \u2212 \u03c9c /2). The lack of\ndispersion reduces dimensionality in RG and makes even\narbitrarily weak perturbations extremely potent in lifting\nthe degeneracy. We set up RG by generalizing (2) to d\ndimensions in the Landau level basis using the Landau\ngauge, and include additional allowed terms:\n\n(\n\n\u0013\nX Z dpx\nX Z dkx \u2020 \u0012 \u2202\n\u22072\u22a5\n\u2032\n\u03c8n,kx\n+ n\u03c9c \u2212\n\u2212 \u03bc \u03c8n,kx + N\n\u03a6\u2020n1 ,px \u03a0\u0302(0)\nS =\nd\u03c4 d\nr\u22a5\nn1 ,n2 \u03a6n2 ,px\n2\u03c0\n\u2202\u03c4\n2m\n2\u03c0\nn1 n2\nn\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\nX Z dkx dpx\nkx h \u2020\nn\n+ g\n\u0393m1 m2 \u221a\n\u03a6n,px \u03c8m1 ,kx + px \u03c8m2 ,\u2212kx + px + h.c.\n2\n2\n2\u03c0 2\u03c0\nB\nnm1 m2\n)\nX Z dkx1 dkx2 dqx\n\u2020\n\u2020\n(16)\n(kx1 , kx2 , qx ) \u03c8m1 ,kx1 \u03c8m2 ,kx2 \u03c8m3 ,kx2 +qx \u03c8m4 ,kx1 \u2212qx + * * * .\n\u0393\u2032\n+ u2\n2\u03c0 2\u03c0 2\u03c0 m1 ...m4\nm ...m\nZ\n\nd\u22122\n\n1\n\n4\n\nWe suppress spin \u03b1 and flavor i indices for brevity. Since\nthe bare fermion states are localized in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation, it is appropriate to\nnot rescale kx in RG. At zero temperature and density,\nfermion self-energy vanishes so that all renormalization\ncomes from the boson field \u03a6. The RG flow equations can\nbe calculated exactly to all orders of perturbation theory\nwhen u2 and the remaining omitted couplings are zero,\nsince then the renormalization of \u03a6 involves summation\nof a geometric series of bare fermion bubble diagrams.\nFollowing the procedure in Ref.19 , we find that under\nrescaling\n\u2032\nr\u22a5\n\u2032\n\n\u03c8 =e\n\n\u2212l\n\n= e r\u22a5\n(d/2\u22121)l\n\n\u2032\n\n\u22122l\n\n\u2032\n\n(d/2\u22121)l\n\n\u03c4 =e\n\n\u03c8\n\n\u03a6 =e\n\n\u03c4\n\n(17)\n\u03a6\n\nthe exact flow equations are:\nd\u03bc\u2032\n= 2\u03bc\u2032\ndl\n\u0001\nd\u03bd\n= 2 \u2212 ag 2 \u03bd\ndl\n\nd\u03c9c\n= 2\u03c9c\n(18)\ndl \u0012\n\u0013\ndg\nd\ng \u2212 bN g 3 ,\n= 3\u2212\ndl\n2\n\nwhere a and b are cut-off dependent constants whose values are not important for the present discussion. Appart\n\nfrom the Gaussian fixed point at \u03bc\u2032 = \u03c9c = \u03bd = g = 0,\n\u2032\nwe can identify\np an interacting fixed point at \u03bc = \u03c9c =\n\u2217\n\u03bd = 0, g = (3 \u2212 d/2)/(bN ) which defines the unitarity limit in any dimension d, and shows how perturbation theory can be justified for large N . In addition to\n\u03bc\u2032 , \u03c9c and \u03bd, various couplings un , which may include\nnon-local short-range potentials and hence multi-particle\ncollision terms, can be relevant at this fixed point. For\nn-particle scattering un we find sufficient indication at\nthe tree-level:\n\u0003\ndun \u0002\n= d + (2 \u2212 d)n un + O(u2 )\ndl\n\n(19)\n\nirrespective of the spatial dependence of interaction potentials in the plane perpendicular to rotation axis, since\ncoordinates do not rescale in this plane. Therefore, all\nun are relevant in d \u2264 2, while in d > 2 they are relevant\nfor n < d/(d \u2212 2).\nThe same conclusions have been reached in the past\nusing \u01eb = 6 \u2212 d expansions in the context of classical\nLandau-Ginzburg theories29 . A formal advantage of the\npresent approach is that the conclusions are justified in\nany number of dimensions as long as N is large, but also\nfor not so large N as long as the un couplings are small\n\n\f10\nand the density of particles is close to zero.\nThe existence of infinitely many relevant directions\nin the parameter space near the Gaussian and unitarity fixed points implies the possibility that there could\nbe many stable interacting fixed points that specify the\nproperties of many different phases. The microscopic details of interactions between particles can then very sensitively determine the concrete properties of a concrete\nsystem at low temperatures. We expect that the properties of the vortex liquid in particular are not universal. The vortex lattice melting transition lines are also\nnot universal, being first order. The superfluid phase is\ngenerally amenable to phenomenological descriptions regardless of the microscopic details, but we can expect\nthat the structure of vortex cores is system dependent.\nF.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe analyzed a simple model of neutral fermionic particles in two dimensions with attractive interactions and\nexplicitly broken time-reversal symmetry. The model is\nroutinely realized in ultra-cold atom experiments with\nfermionic atoms near a broad two-body Feshbach resonance, but it also captures some essential properties of\nmuch more complicated electronic systems. We assumed\nthat the low-temperature superfluid is type-II so that it\nhosts an Abrikosov lattice of vortices at a fixed flux density. Using a semi-classical perturbative expansion we\nfound that a second order phase transition separates the\nsuperfluid from a normal phase of thermally excited unpaired fermions in the quantum Hall regime. We calculated the critical temperature as a function of interaction\nstrength and density and showed that in some circumstances for weak interactions this phase transition can\noccur even at zero temperature.\nThe unusual properties of the quantum Hall insulator\nat zero temperature were then exploited to argue that\nthe second order superfluid-insulator transition obtained\nin the naive perturbation theory must be preempted by a\nfirst order transition due to quantum vortex lattice melting. This conclusion followed from the analysis of quantum fluctuations related to vortex dynamics. We compared the potential energy of a vortex lattice with the\nkinetic energy of a vortex liquid and showed that the latter always wins on the superfluid side close enough to the\npairing transition. The vortex liquid is a strongly corre-\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nV.J.Emery, S.A.Kivelson; Nature 374, 434 (1995)\nC.Dasgupta, B.I.Halperin; Phys.Rev.Lett. 47, 1556 (1981)\nM.P.A.Fisher, D.H.Lee; Phys.Rev.B 39, 2756 (1989)\nY.Wang, Z.A.Xu, T.Kakeshita, S.Uchida, S.Ono, Y.Ando,\nand N.P.Ong; Phys.Rev.B 64, 224519 (2001)\nL.Li, J.G.Checkelsky, S.Komiya, Y.Ando, N.P.Ong; Nature Phys. 3, 311 (2007)\nZ.Te\u0161anovi\u0107; Phys.Rev.Lett. 93, 217004 (2004)\n\nlated normal phase which cannot be smoothly connected\nwith the quantum Hall state of unpaired fermions.\nFinally, we argued that the properties of a vortex liquid in two dimensions at a finite flux density are not\nuniversal. Different materials can exhibit different normal states resulting from vortex lattice quantum melting,\nincluding states with topological order such as quantum\nHall states of Cooper pairs, or states with broken symmetries involving density waves for example. At zero temperature we expect that such states are insulators. At finite\ntemperatures, below a crossover temperature, the normal\nstates will be at least influenced by the proximate nontrivial zero-temperature phases, but we cannot rule out\nthe existence of genuine finite temperature vortex liquids\n(depending on the broken symmetries of the zero temperature insulator) which are separated from the disordered\nnormal phase by a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.\nUltra-cold atom experiments have the potential to directly explore the phenomena discussed in this paper.\nThe target regime would be a combination of fast rotation and low particle density where a few lowest Landau\nlevels would be occupied in the quantum Hall state at\nlow temperatures. It is in this limit and on the BCS side\nof the Feshbach resonance where multiple isolated superfluid phases could be found separated by normal states\nas the density of particles or rotation rate is varied. In\norder to faithfully represent our model the experiment\nwould need to achieve this limit with a trap whose harmonic frequency is not much higher than the rotation\nrate. The phenomena predicted here might survive even\nin more confining traps, but the structure of vortex lattices and hence the phase boundaries would be affected\nby the trap in a manner that we cannot predict with a\nuniform model. Observing Cooper pairs at low temperatures in the normal states would be a first weak indicator\nof the proximity to a vortex liquid.\n\nG.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI am indebted to Olexei Motrunich, Gil Refael, Anton\nBurkov, Arun Paramekanti, Carlos Bolech and Satyan\nBhongale for very helpful discussions.
