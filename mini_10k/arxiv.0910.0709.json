This may require that the harmonic trap\nbecomes an expulsive parabolic potential in some time interval. The cooling times achieved are also\nshorter than previous minimal times using optimal-control bang-bang methods and real frequencies.\nPACS numbers: 37.10.De, 42.50.-p, 37.10.Vz\n\nA fast adiabatic expansion in a short finite time looks\nlike a contradiction in terms. An \"adiabatic\" process\nin quantum mechanics is a slow process where the system follows at all times the instantaneous eigenvalues and\neigenstates of the time-dependent Hamiltonian. This is\nin a sense maximally efficient as the populations do not\nchange, i.e. there is no heating or friction, but the price\nto pay is that the long times needed may render the process useless or even impossible to implement. Thus, a\nhighly desirable goal is to prepare the same final states\nand energies of the adiabatic process in a given finite time\ntf , without necessarily following the instantaneous eigenstates along the way. We would also like the process to be\nrobust with respect to arbitrary initial states. If fulfilled,\nthis old goal [1] has important implications. In particular, cooling without phase-space compression, which is\nall that is needed for many applications other than Bose\nEinstein condensation, could be performed in fast cycles\nincreasing, for example, the flux of cold atoms produced\nand the signal to noise ratio in an atomic clock [2], or\nin cold-atom pulsed beam experiments and related technology [3]. This goal also includes as a particular case\na long standing question in the fields of optimal control\ntheory and finite time thermodynamics, namely, to optimize the passage between two thermal states of a system\n[4, 5, 6, 7]. For time-dependent harmonic oscillators,\nminimal times have been established using \"bang-bang\"\nreal-frequency processes believed up to now to be optimal [6], in which the frequencies are changed suddenly\nat certain instants but kept constant otherwise. In this\nletter we shall describe a robust solution to the stated\ngeneral goal for atoms trapped in a time-dependent harmonic oscillator which applies both to equilibrium and\nnon-equilibrium states. In particular we describe cooling\nprocesses performed in a time interval smaller than the\nminimal time of the bang-bang methods considered so\nfar. We shall for simplicity describe our method for states\nrepresenting single atoms of mass m, but the same results\n\nare immediately applicable to N -body non-interacting\nfermions or to a Tonks-Girardeau gas [8], and generalizations will be relevant for other driving processes, such as\ncold atom launching or the transport of ultracold atoms\nwith optical tweezers [9].\nWe consider an effectively one dimensional time dependent harmonic oscillator, H = p\u03022 /2m + m\u03c9(t)2 q\u0302 2 /2,\nwith an initial angular frequency \u03c9(0) > 0 at time t = 0\nand final frequency \u03c9f = \u03c9(tf ) < \u03c9(0) at time tf . (This\namounts to a temperature reduction by a factor \u03c9f /\u03c9(0)\nif the initial and final states are canonical.) The challenge\nis to find a trajectory \u03c9(t) between these two values so\nthat the populations of the oscillator levels n = 0, 1, 2...\nat tf are equal than the ones at t = 0. Our main tool to\nengineer \u03c9(t) and the state dynamics will be the solution\nof the corresponding Schr\u00f6dinger equation based on the\nexistence of invariants of motion [1, 10, 11, 12] of the form\n1 2\n\u03c0\u0302 ], where \u03c0\u0302 = b(t)p\u0302 \u2212 m\u1e03q\u0302\nI(t) = 1/2[(1/b2)q\u0302 2 m\u03c902 + m\nplays the role of a momentum conjugate to q\u0302/b, the dots\nare derivatives with respect to time, and \u03c90 is in principle an arbitrary constant. The scaling, dimensionless\nfunction b = b(t) satisfies the subsidiary condition\nb\u0308 + \u03c9(t)2 b = \u03c902 /b3 ,\n\n(1)\n\nan Ermakov equation where real solutions must be chosen to make I Hermitian [13]. \u03c90 is frequently rescaled\nto unity by a scale transformation of b [1]. Other convenient choice is \u03c90 = \u03c9(0) as we shall see. I(t) has\nthe structure of a harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian as\nwell (as long as \u03c902 > 0), with time-dependent eigenvectors |n(t)i and time-independent eigenvalues (n +\n1/2)h\u0304\u03c90 .\nThe general solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation is a superposition\nof orthonormal \"expanding\nP\ni\u03b1n (t)\nmodes\" \u03c8(t, x) =\nc\ne\nhx|n(t)i where \u03b1n (t) =\nn\nn\nRt\n\u2212(n + 1/2)\u03c90 0 dt\u2032 /b2 , and the cn are time independent\namplitudes.

Substituting this in the subsidiary condition gives \u03c902 = \u03c9(0)2 + AC \u2212 B 2 . For a trap with hard\nwalls, the square-root-in-time scaling factor b (A = 0) has\nbeen shown to provide fast and efficient cooling [15, 16].\nHowever, for harmonic traps, much more commonly realized in ultracold experiments, such time dependence\nleads to negative values of \u03c902 even for modest cooling objectives. This makes Eq. (2) invalid and, moreover, linear combinations of a continuum of non-square-integrable\nexpanding modes would be needed to describe the evolution of any single eigenstate of the initial trap. This\nis of course only a drawback to calculate the dynamics,\nnot to realize the expansion in the laboratory. Numerical\nresults using other (adiabatic basis) methods [17] show\nthat, even though the root-in-time scaling is singularly\nefficient for adiabatic following as discussed below, the\ncooling performance fails for very short expansion times\ntf . An alternative, successful strategy put forward here,\ninspired in inverse scattering techniques for complex potential optimization [18, 19, 20], is to leave \u03c9(t) undetermined at first and impose properties on b and its derivatives at the boundaries, t = 0 and tf , to assure: (a)\nthat any eigenstate of H(0) evolves as a single expanding mode and that (b) this expanding mode becomes, up\nto a position-independent phase factor, equal to the corresponding eigenstate of the Hamiltonian H(tf ) of the\nfinal trap. This keeps the populations in the instantaneous basis equal at the initial and final times. After\nb(t) and its derivatives are fixed at the boundaries, b(t)\nmay be chosen as a real function satisfying the boundary\nconditions, for example as a polynomial or some other\nconvenient functional form with enough free parameters.\nOnce b(t) has been determined, the physical frequency\n\u03c9(t) is obtained from the subsidiary equation (1).\nLet us first discuss the conditions at t = 0. By choosing b(0) = 1, \u1e03(0) = 0, H(0) and I(0) commute and\nhave common eigenfunctions at that instant. We set\n\u03c90 = \u03c9(0) from now on so that b\u0308(0) = 0 must hold\nas well. These boundary conditions imply that any ini-\n\n6\n\nb\n\n\u03a8n (t, x) =\n\n\u0010 m\u03c9 \u00111/4\n\n4\n2\n0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nt\u0090tf\n\nFIG. 1: (color online).

In general\nH(t) and I(t) will not commute for t > 0, so that the\nexpanding mode \u03a8n (t) may have more than one component in the \"adiabatic basis\" of instantaneous eigenstates of H(t), {un (t)}, n = 0, 1, 2..., \u0014where un\u0015\n(t) =\nq\n\u0010\n\u00111/4\n\u0002\n\u0003\nm\u03c9(t)\nm\u03c9(t)\nm\n1\nexp \u2212 2h\u0304\n\u03c9(t)x2 Hn\n\u03c0h\u0304\nh\u0304 x . At\n(2n n!)1/2\ntime tf we want \u03a8n (tf ) to be proportional, up to the\nglobal phase factor ei\u03b1n (tf ) , to the corresponding eigenstate of the final trap un (tf ). To this end we impose\nb(tf ) = \u03b3 = [\u03c90 /\u03c9f ]1/2 , \u1e03(tf ) = 0, b\u0308(tf ) = 0. From\nEq. (2), one finds hH(tf )in in terms of bf = b(tf ) and\n\u1e03f = db(t)/dt|t=tf . Since bf and b \u0307f can be set independently we can minimize the terms depending on them\nseparately, and the global minimum is found to be precisely at the adiabatic energy (n + 1/2)h\u0304\u03c9f , which corresponds to our boundary conditions. Any other choice\nwould necessarily produce \"frictional heating\".\nSubstituting the simple polynomial ansatz\nb(t) =\n\n5\nX\n\na j tj\n\n(3)\n\nj=0\n\ninto the six boundary conditions gives six equations\nthat can be solved to provide the coefficients, b(t) =\n6 (\u03b3 \u2212 1) s5 \u2212 15 (\u03b3 \u2212 1) s4 + 10 (\u03b3 \u2212 1) s3 + 1, where s =\nt/tf , see Fig. 1.

These values can be found\nin actual experiments [21]. We could formally study subhertz frequencies \u03c9f but they would render the trap very\nsensitive to low-frequency acoustic noise [22]. Compare\nfirst the finite times considered (from 2 to 25 ms) with the\ntimes necessary for actual adiabatic following during the\nwhole interval 0 < t < tf . The adiabaticity\ncondition for\n\u221a\nthe harmonic oscillator becomes | 2\u03c9\u0307/(8\u03c9 2 )| \u226a 1. For\na linear ramp, \u03c9(t) \u2192 \u03c90 + (\u03c9f \u2212 \u03c90 )t/tf , this implies a\nvery long time, tf \u226b 1.1 s. In fact it would be necessary\nto expand the trap for 6 s to achieve a 1% relative error\nin the final energy of the ground state. A much more efficient strategy is to distribute \u03c9\u0307/\u03c9 uniformly along the\ntrajectory, i.e., \u03c9\u0307/\u03c9 2 = c, c being constant. Thus the\ntrap expansion speed decreases with the splitting. Solving this differential equation and imposing \u03c9f = \u03c9(tf ) we\nget \u03c9(t) = \u03c90 /[1 \u2212 (\u03c9f \u2212 \u03c90 )t/(tf \u03c9f )]. This corresponds\nto the case A = 0, 2B = \u2212(\u03c9f \u2212 \u03c90 )/(tf \u03c9f ), C = 1\n(i.e., a square-root-in-time scaling factor), and implies\ntf \u226b 11 ms from the adiabaticity condition. A 1% error\nlevel for the ground state energy is achieved after 45 ms.\nA prominent feature of the trajectories, see Fig. 2b, is\nthat \u03c9(t)2 may be negative during some time interval in\nwhich the potential becomes an expulsive parabola. This\nis physically feasible and has been realized experimentally with an offset magnetic field that overcomes the optical dipole well in the axial direction of elongated cigarshaped optical traps [23]. In general the (imaginary) frequency of the repulsive region increases for shorter cooling times as shown in Fig. 2b.\nThe appearance of transient energies below the final\none, see e.g. the solid line in Fig. 3a near t/tf = 0.15,\nmay be misleading. It is a consequence of the repulsive\nregime and should not be interpreted as useful cooling\nin a time shorter than tf . Since the \"trap\" is actually\na repeller the kinetic energy would grow without bound\nif the potential were kept frozen at the time when the\nenergy is minimal. Similarly, if the potential were suddenly changed into its final form, V (tf ), the total energy\nwould be higher than the adiabatic energy, i.e., the one\n\n0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nt\u0090tf\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n0.0\n\nHbL\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nt\u0090tf\n\nFIG. 3: (color online).

(b) The squared frequencies \u03c9(t)2 .\n\nfor a population-preserving process.\nFig. 3 illustrates that a given cooling objective may\nbe attained in less time than the minimal time required\nby real-frequency bang-bang trajectories, optimal among\nreal-frequency trajectories [6].

Thus the fastest process to reach the target state\ncorresponds to the limit of \u03c91 \u2192 0 and \u03c92 \u2192 \u221e [6] with\np\n1 \u2212 \u03c9f /\u03c90\nmin\n.\n(5)\ntf =\n\u221a\n\u03c9f \u03c90\n\nThese results are based on optimal control theory, initial\nand final thermal states, and the constraint \u03c91,2 > 0.\nClearly, relaxing the positivity condition for the intermediate frequencies, makes faster processes with tf < tmin\nf\npossible, which, moreover, involve only finite frequencies.\nSince Eq.

A bang-bang example is\nshown in Fig. 3 (dot-dashed lines), for tf = 2 ms, much\nshorter than the time tmin\n\u2248 6 ms corresponding to the\nf\ninitial and final frequencies chosen. \u03c91 = i\u03c9I is imaginary, and the corresponding b1 (t) solving the Ermakov\nequation with initial conditions b1 (0) = 1 and b \u03071 (0) = 1,\n\u03c9 2 +\u03c9 2\ntakes the form b1 (t) = [1 + 0\u03c92 I sinh2 (\u03c9I t)]1/2 . In the\nI\nsecond segment we assume \u03c92 real which gives, with the\nfinal conditions\nb\u00112 (tf ) = \u03b3 and b \u03072 (tf ) = 0, b2 (t) =\n\u0010\n\u03c902\n\u03c922 \u03b3 2\n\n\u2212 \u03b3 2 sin2 [\u03c92 (t \u2212 tf )]}1/2 . The matching\nconditions b1 (\u03c41 ) = b2 (\u03c41 ) and b \u03071 (\u03c41 ) = b \u03072 (\u03c41 ) are then\nsolved for \u03c41 and tf , see Fig. 3 and its caption for details.\nOf course the discontinuous jumps in this type of trajectory call into question its realizability. Fig. 3 also shows\ntwo smooth trajectories for tf = 2 ms corresponding to\ntwo different ansatz for b (polynomial and exponential\nof a polynomial). The resulting rates of change of \u03c9(t)\nare feasible with present technology. Indeed the intensity\nof a dipole trap (the frequency scales as the square root\nof the intensity) can be changed by three or four orders\nof magnitude in 100 ns using acousto-optics or electrooptics modulators. To monitor the sign of the square frequencies, one can superimpose two dipole beams locked\nrespectively on the blue and red side of the line. By alternating them rapidly with a control of their relative\nintensity, one can shape the square frequencies and their\nsigns at will. Alternatively, one can combine magnetic\nand dipole traps.\nFinally, while the initial (and final) state in Figs. 2\nand 3 is the ground state, Fig. 4 illustrates that the same\n\u03c9(t) trajectories work as well for arbitrary excited states.\nThis also means that fast frictionless cooling is directly\napplicable to arbitrary superpositions or mixed states, as\nwell as to simple many body systems such as a polarized\nFermi gas, or its (symmetrized) bosonic counterpart, the\nTonks-Girardeau gas. Similar techniques may also be\napplicable for weakly interacting bosonic systems, the\ncontrol of soliton dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates\n[23, 24], and to manipulate the transport of ultracold\natoms [9].\nWe have in summary described a method for fast, fric{\u03b3 2 +\n\ntionless cooling in a harmonic trap based on a modulation\nof the trap frequency \u03c9(t) that includes in general time\nintervals in which the potential becomes expulsive. It is\napplicable to arbitrary initial states, not necessarily in\nequilibrium. The algorithm to design \u03c9(t) depends on\nflexible ansatz functions that can be modified or made\nmore and more complex, by adding parameters, to satisfy further requirements. This could be used, e.g., to\nminimize the maximal frequencies along the trajectory.\nWe are grateful to M. Berry and L. S.
