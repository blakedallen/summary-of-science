By using a\nvariety of techniques (low-order perturbation theory, self-consistent Born approximation, replicas,\nand supersymmetry) we make a case for a possible complete localization of all the electronic states\nand compute the density of states.\n\nAnderson localization in two spatial dimensions (2D)\nhas traditionally been studied in the context of doped\nsemiconductors which are characterized by the presence\nof fermionic excitations with an extended Fermi surface. After having been maturing steadily for almost\nthree decades, the theory of 2D localization was rekindled by the advent of high-Tc superconductors and, more\nrecently, graphene, in which systems the Fermi surface\nof quasiparticle excitations consists of isolated (nodal)\nFermi points.\nUnlike in the conventional \"non-relativistic\" 2D electron gas (2DEG), in the systems of nodal fermions the\nsingle-particle density of states (DOS) can be strongly\naffected by disorder. Moreover, a greater variety of DOS\nbehaviors and putative localization scenaria appear to be\ndetermined not only by the symmetry of disorder, but its\nstrength as well1 .\nIn undoped graphene, the low-energy Dirac-like quasiparticle excitations reside near\n\u221a two conical points located\nat the momenta K = (4\u03c0/3 3a, 0) and K\u2032 = \u2212K (here\na is the lattice spacing) in the inequivalent corners of the\nhexagonal Brillouin zone. These excitations can be conveniently described in terms of the (retarded) bare Green\nfunction\n\u011cR (\u03c9, p) = [(\u01eb + i0)\u03b3\u03020 \u2212 p\u03bc \u03b3\u0302\u03bc ]\u22121\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bc = x, y and the fermion velocity is v =\n1.\nThe 4 \u00d7 4 \u03b3\u0302-matrices \u03b3\u03020,x,y = (1 \u2297 \u03c3\u03023 , i1 \u2297\n\u03c3\u03022 , \u2212i\u03c3\u03023 \u2297 \u03c3\u03021 ) act in the space of Dirac bi-spinors \u03c8 =\n(\u03c8K (A), \u03c8K (B), \u03c8K \u2032 (A), \u03c8K \u2032 (B)) composed of the values of the K(K\u2032 )-momentum components of the electron\nwave function on the A and B sublattices of the bipartite\nlattice of graphene.\nAn important feature of the fermion spectrum described by Eq.(1) is its \"chiral\" (\u01eb \u2192 \u2212\u01eb) symmetry,\nwhich, if respected by disorder, facilitates a possible\nemergence of delocalized states at \u01eb = 01 . Indeed, unlike in the case of the conventional 2DEG prone to weak\nlocalization, the conductivity of graphene appears to be\nsurprisingly robust, assuming values about three times\nhigher than the ballistic result (\u03c3 = 2e2 /\u03c0 2 h\u0304) pertaining\nto the case of vanishing disorder2 .\nIn an attempt to explain this observation, a number of proposals invoked the presence of an effective\nrandom magnetic field (RMF) causing a suppression of\nweak antilocalization that would otherwise have occurred\ndue to an ordinary (chirally non-symmetric) potential\n\ndisorder2,3 . In that regard, it should be noted that, being a source of elastic scattering itself, a RMF, too, can\nbe solely responsible for the onset of localization in the\nconventional 2DEG, the latter developing in accordance\nwith the standard unitary scenario4.\nIn this Letter, we will focus on the case of disorder\nwhich, in the framework of the Dirac equation, can be\ndescribed as a random (and, generally speaking, nonAbelian in the valley subspace) vector potential with the\nGaussian variance\n< \u00c2\u03bc (q) \u2297 \u00c2\u03bd (\u2212q) >= [1 \u2297 1w(q)\nq\u03bc q\u03bd\n+(\u03c3\u0302+ \u2297 \u03c3\u0302\u2212 + \u03c3\u0302\u2212 \u2297 \u03c3\u0302+ )w(2K)](\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2 )\nq\n\n(2)\n\nwhich is characterized by a parameter g = na2 proportional to the areal density n of the RMF sources (\"defects\") with an internal length scale l. Beyond this length\n(q <\n\u223c 1/l) the function w(q) decays algebraically\nw(q) = g/(lq)2\u03b7\n\n(3)\n\nAlthough for any \u03b7 > 0 the parameters g and l can be\ncombined together, we choose to keep them separate. We\nalso note that, owing to its effective nature, this RMF\ndoes not couple to physical fermion spin (if any).\nWith an eye on the problem of electronic transport in\ngraphene, we will set out to explore the general case of\nvector disorder with a variable exponent \u03b7 \u2265 0. For \u03b7 > 0\nand l \u226b a the inter-node scattering does get suppressed\n(w(1/l) \u226b w(2K)), and the problem can be effectively\ntreated as a single-node one (hence, in effect, Abelian).\nWe will comment on the limitations of the single-node\napproximation below.\nThe value of the exponent \u03b7 is determined by the type\nof topological structural defects, such as disclinations\n(isolated pentagon- and heptagon-rings) with \u03b7 = 1 and\nl \u223c a, dislocations (pairs of adjacent pentagons and heptagons) with \u03b7 = 0 and l given by the Burgers vector,\netc.5 . Moreover, a mathematically similar description\nwas also proposed for the effect of thermal shape fluctuations of the graphene sheet (\"ripples\") whose origin\ncan be traced back to the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of 2D crystals.\nIn recent derivations based on the theory of 2D elastic\nmembranes, the effective gauge field A\u03bc was related to\na fluctuating local height h of the graphene sheet with\nrespect to the substrate (the authors of Ref.6 derived\n\n\f2\nA\u03bc \u221d (\u2202\u03bd2 h)2 , although a much stronger dependence,\nA\u03bc \u221d (\u2202\u03bd h)2 , can occur as well7 ).\nIn what follows, we consider the more relevant version\nof RMF disorder described in Ref.7 where g \u223c 1, l \u223c\n5nm, and the exponent \u03b7 = 0.2 can be deduced from\nthe previously studied asymptotic behavior of the height\nfluctuations of a 2D membrane of size L (< h2 >\u221d L1+\u03b7 ).\nDespite the lack of immediate physical examples, we\nfind it instructive to extend our discussion to the entire\nrange of exponents 0 \u2264 \u03b7 < 2, for which the root mean\nsquare (RMS) value of the divergence-free part of the\nvector potential\nZ\nd2 q\nA\u03b7 = [\nw(q)]1/2 \u221d L\u03b7\u22121\n(4)\n(2\u03c0)2\n(A1 \u221d ln L/l) increases with the system size, although\nthe RMS of the physical magnetic field B = \u2207 \u00d7 A\nand the corresponding energy density remain finite, B\u03b7 \u221d\nl\u03b7\u22122 .\nIt should be noted, though, that any value \u03b7 6= 1\nwould be in conflict (see Ref.8 ) with the observed electron density dependence of the conductivity of graphene,\n\u03c3 \u223c ne 2 , if the ripples were to dominate over the other\nsources of elastic scattering.\nWhile the extensively studied Abelian and non-Abelian\nversions of the \u03b7 = 0 problem are amenable to such powerful techniques as renormalization group, conformal algebra, and Liouville field theory, the case \u03b7 > 0 has,\nso far, only been studied for \u03b7 = 1 and in the ballistic\nregime (\u01eb \u226b 1/l)8 . In order to gain a preliminary insight, we first estimate the lowest-order correction to the\n(gauge-invariant) DOS\nZ\ndpdq\nq\u03bc q\u03bd\n\u03b4\u03bd\u03b7 (\u01eb) = Im\nw(q)(\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2 )T r[\u03b3\u0302\u03bc \u011cR (\u03c9, p)\n16\u03c0 5\nq\n1 \u2212 \u03b7 \u01eb1\u22122\u03b7\n\u03b3\u03020 \u011cR (\u03c9, p)\u03b3\u0302\u03bd \u011cR (\u03c9, p + q)] \u223c g\n(5)\n\u03b7\nl2\u03b7\nwhich, incidentally, vanishes at \u03b7 = 1, while at \u03b7 = 0\nthis correction (\u03b4\u03bd0 (\u01eb) \u223c g\u01eb ln \u01eb) is consistent with the\npreviously obtained exact result\n\u03bd0 (\u01eb) \u221d \u01eb2/z\u22121\n\n(6)\n\nwhere z = 1 + g for g < 2 (weak coupling), whereas at\nstrong coupling (g > 2) z = (8g)1/2 \u2212 1 9 .\nIt should be mentioned, however, that at \u03b7 = 0 and\nl \u223c a the original model (2,3) becomes SU (2)-symmetric\nin the valley space (w(0) = w(2K)), in which case the\npower-law DOS features a universal exponent 1/7 10 .\nThe first order DOS correction (5) becomes comparable to the bare DOS (\u03bd (0) (\u01eb) \u223c \u01eb) at \u01eb \u223c g 1/2\u03b7 /l, thus\nindicating the importance of higher-order corrections at\nstill lower energies. Routinely, a further improvement\nwould be sought out in the framework of the customary self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) for the\n(gauge-non-invariant) fermion self-energy\nZ\ndq\nw(q)\n\u03a3\u0302R (\u01eb, p) =\n(7)\n(2\u03c0)2 \u011cR (\u01eb, p + q)\u22121 \u2212 \u03a3\u0302R (\u01eb, p + q)\n\nIt can be readily seen, however, that for \u03b7 < 1 the SCBA\nsolution remains finite at the nodal point, \u03a3R (0, 0) =\ni\u0393 \u223c ig 1/2 /l, whereas for \u03b7 \u2265 1 it is determined to the\n1/2\nRMS of the RMF (\u0393 \u223c A\u03b7 ), both diverging with increasing L. A finite imaginary self-energy would then\nimply a finite DOS at \u01eb = 0 (namely, \u03bd\u03b7 (0) \u223c \u0393| ln \u0393a| 1 ),\nin a stark contrast with Eq.(6), which calls the validity\nof SCBA into question.\nIt is well known that for \u03b7 = 0 the failure of SCBA\nstems from the fact that perturbative corrections represented by diagrams with crossing disorder lines turn out\nto be as important as the non-crossed ones (which SCBA,\nin effect, accounts for)10 . However, for \u03b7 \u2265 1 the situation appears to be more involved, since a singular (small\nangle) scattering tends to favor the so-called \"maximally\ncrossed\" (including the nominally non-crossed) diagrams,\nas can be seen, e.g., from a direct comparison between\nthe crossed and non-crossed second order corrections.\nAlbeit not being a justification for SCBA, this observation attests to a potentially singular behavior of the selfenergy at small energies and/or momenta, which, in turn,\nwould be indicative of a strong modification of the corresponding quantum states by disorder that might even\ngive rise to their complete localization.\nA further evidence to that effect can be gathered from\nthe properties of the exact zero-energy states which can\nbe explicitly contructed for any \u03b7 \u2265 0. In the transverse gauge representation of the random vector potential A\u03bc = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd \u03c6 describing a given RMF configuration,\nthe exact (unnormalized) zero-energy states read\n\u0012 \u03c6(r) \u0013\ne\n(8)\n\u03c8\u00b1 (r) \u221d (1 \u00b1 \u03b3\u03020 )\ne\u2212\u03c6(r)\nAmong the traditional objects of interest are such quantifiers of the (normalized) zero-energy wave functions'\nstatisics as the inverse participation ratios (IPR)\nR 2n\u03c6(r) 2\ne\nd r\nR\nPn =<\n>\n(9)\n( e2\u03c6(r\u2032 ) d2 r\u2032 )n\n\nwhere the averaging over different RMF configurations is\nperformed with the statistical weight\nZ\nd2 q |\u03c6q |2\nP[\u03c6] = exp[\u2212\n]\n(10)\n(2\u03c0)2 2w(q)\nThe IPR can be computed with the use of replicas,\nwhereby one multiplies Eq.(9) by the denominator (normalization factor) raised to the power N \u2212 n, evaluates the resulting average, and eventually takes the limit\nN \u2192 0, thus arriving at the result\nPn = lim <\nN \u21920\n\nZ\n\ne2n\u03c6(r)+2\n\nPN \u2212n\ni=1\n\n\u03c6(ri ) 2\n\nd r\n\nN\n\u2212n\nY\n\nd2 ri >\n\ni\n\nL2\n\u223c 2n C\u03b7 (n)n/\u03b7 (11)\nl\nwhere for integer values of \u03b7 the coefficient C\u03b7 (n) is a\nlogarithmic function of L (e.g., C1 (n) \u221d ln L/l).\n\n\f3\nThe (nearly) quadratic (for all n) dependence on the\nsystem size is related to the groupping of the arguments\n(|ri \u2212 rj | \u223c l) which indicates a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the replica space. Furthermore, the absence of n-dependence (except, for, possibly, logarithmic\nfactors) suggests that for \u03b7 > 0 the zero-energy states\ntend to (pre)localize over a characteristic length of order\nl (possibly, up to a logarithmic factor).\nThis result bears a certain resemblance to that found\nin the strong coupling regime of the previously studied\n\u03b7 = 0 problem9 .

Using the\nsame replica trick, the latter can be cast in the form\ne2\u03c6(r1 ) e2\u03c6(r2 )\n< \u03c8 2 (r1 )\u03c8 2 (r2 ) >=< R 2\u03c6(r\u2032 ) 2 \u2032 2 >\n( e\nd r)\n|r\n\u2212\nr2 | 2\u03b7\nC\n(2)\n1\n\u03b7\n(N \u2212 1)(\n) ] (12)\n\u223c lim l2N \u22124 exp[\u2212\nN \u21920\n\u03b7\nl\n\n\u01eb\n+i(\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 + \u2202\u03bc \u03b8)\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 + (cos 2\u03c6 \u2212 cos 2\u03b8)] (15)\na\nThe negative sign in front of the kinetic term of the field\n\u03b8 is a salient feature of the bosonized ghost action12 .\nHad all the integrals over the bosonic fields been convergent, one could have first integrated over \u03b8, then\nshifted the field \u03c6 by i\u03c6 and, finally, integrated it out\nas well. The remaining integral over \u03c6 would then have\nall the operators \u03c8 in the integrand replaced by e\u03c6 , in\nagreement with Eqs.(11,12).\nHowever, under a closer inspection one finds that the\nintegral over \u03c6 appears\nto be controled by a modified\nR\nweight P[\u03c6] exp( d2 qq 2 |\u03c6q |2 /(4\u03c0)2 ) and, therefore, diverges for any \u03b7 > 0 (and g > 2 for \u03b7 = 0), thereby\nprecluding one from the being able to readily integrate\nover \u03c6 and \u03b8.\nNevertheless, the problem can be circumvented if one\nfirst integrates over the disorder field, thus arriving at the\n\"(sub)Sine-Gordon\" action with a quadratic part whose\ndiagonal terms remain positive definite for the modes\nwith momenta q \u2264 g 1/2\u03b7 /l\nZ\nd2 q 2\n(2)\n \u0304\nS [\u03c6, \u03b8, \u03be, \u03be] =\nq [(1 + w(q))|\u03c6q |2\n(2\u03c0)2\n+(w(q) \u2212 1)|\u03b8q |2 + |\u03beq |2 + 2w(q)\u03c6q \u03b8\u2212q ]\n(16)\n\nwhile its non-Gaussian part is given by the last term in\nthat clearly shows an unphysical (\"negative norm\") beEq.(15).\nhavior in the replica limit, which pattern is consistent\nAlbeit not being amenable to the renormalization\nwith the replica symmetry breaking and a possible localgroup treatment for any \u03b7 > 0, the resulting model can\nization of the zero-energy states.\nstill be studied with the use of the variational method.\nFrom the formal standpoint, the origin of the above\nIn applications of this technique, the non-Gaussian part\nbehavior lies in the divergence of the corresponding inof the action is treated as a source of possible mass terms\ntegral over the disorder field for any \u03b7 > 0 (at \u03b7 = 0 it\nwhich cut off all the infrared divergencies.

Interestingly, at \u03b7 = 1 the energy dependence (21)\nresembles that found in the unitary limit of random potential scattering1 (cf. Eq.(21) with the result reported\nin Ref.13 ).\nIt is worth noting that in the single-node approximation the effect of (Abelian) potential scattering is not expected to be localizing (which conclusion can be viewed\nas another manifestation of the Klein's paradox)14. However, the above results indicate that, by contrast, the effect of a RMF on the Dirac fermions might be confining,\nconsistent with the earlier observations8,15 .\nOn the other hand, the authors of Ref.16 argued that\nin the single-node approximation the effective description\nof undoped graphene can be achieved in terms of a pair\nof decoupled Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) or (if chiral\nsymmetry is broken) non-linear \u03c3 (NL\u03c3) models, each of\nwhich has a topological term driving it to a stable fixed\npoint of either symplectic (if the time-reversal invariance\nis intact) or unitary (as in the present case of a RMF)\nsymmetry.\nHowever, the validity of the conclusions drawn in\nRefs.16 hinges on the possibility of performing various\ndisorder averages without encountering any divergencies\n\u03bd\u03b7 (\u01eb) =\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n7\n\nA.Altland and M.R.Zirnbauer, Phys.Rev.B55, 1142\n(1997); A.

As follows from\nthe previous discussion, such assumptions can only be\njustified in the weak-coupling regime (g < 2) of the shortrange-correlated RMF (\u03b7 = 0), thus allowing for possible\nalternative scenarios for \u03b7 > 0. In that regard, it should\nalso be mentioned that recent numerical simulations17\nseem to contradict the predictions of Ref.16 pertaining\nto the non-chirally-symmetrical symplectic case.\nThe above picture also suggests that, once the internode scattering has been put back in, the two WZW/NL\u03c3\nmodels become coupled and the topological terms cancel against each other, thereby restoring the standard\nlocalizing behavior, which in the RMF case would be described by the unitary NL\u03c3-model (presumably, similar\nto that previously derived for non-relativistic spin-1/2\nfermions with a gyromagnetic ratio equal two18 ).\nAlthough the above scenario is believed to be rather\ngeneric, there might be such exclusions as the SU (2)\n(valley)-symmetric \u03b7 = 0 case of the model (2,3) where\nthe zero-energy states remain critical (delocalized) for all\ng 10 . Moreover, it is also possible that a non-Gaussian\n(truly smooth) long-range-correlated RMF can support\nfermion trajectories which follow the lines of zero field\nand enable semiclassical percolation19 . This possibility\nlies well outside the domain of the Gaussian model (2,3),\nthough.\nTo conclude, in this work we applied a number of\ntechniques to gain insight into the behavior of 2D Dirac\nfermions subject to a generic power-law correlated RMF.\nThe available evidence suggests that the zero-energy\nstates become localized, while the DOS diverges at \u01eb = 0.\nThe results of this work can facilitate a better understanding of the effects of ripples and topological structural defects on electronic transport in graphene and\nother nodal fermion systems, such as the vortex line liquid phase of high-Tc cuprates.\nThis research was supported by NSF under Grant\nDMR-0349881.\n\n8\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\nD.
