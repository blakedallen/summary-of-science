We discuss universal properties of higher order cumulants of net baryon\nnumber fluctuations and point out their relevance for the analysis of freeze-out and\ncritical conditions in heavy ion collisions at LHC and RHIC.\n\n1. Chemical freeze-out, the hadron resonance gas and lattice QCD\nHigher order moments, or more accurately higher order cumulants, of conserved charges\nare central observables analyzed in the ongoing low energy runs at RHIC. It also is\nquite straightforward to analyze their thermal properties in equilibrium thermodynamics\nof QCD, e.g. by performing lattice QCD calculations. Ratios of cumulants of\ndifferent order are particularly well suited for a comparison with experiment as they\nare independent of the interaction volume. Lattice QCD calculations have shown that\nsuch ratios, e.g. ratios of baryon number, electric charge or strangeness fluctuations,\nare quite sensitive probes for detecting critical behavior in QCD. They are sensitive\nto universal scaling properties at vanishing as well as non-vanishing baryon chemical\npotential (\u03bcB ) and directly reflect the internal degrees of freedom that are carriers of\nthe corresponding conserved charge [1, 2] in a thermal medium. These ratios change\nrapidly in the crossover region corresponding to the chiral transition in QCD and reflect\nthe change from hadronic to partonic degrees of freedom [3].\nIn the low temperature phase of QCD ratios of cumulants seem to be well described\nby a hadron resonance gas model (HRG) [1, 3, 4]. The HRG is also very successful in\ndescribing the thermal conditions which characterize the chemical freeze-out of hadron\nspecies. The freeze-out temperature and its dependence on \u03bcB is found to be close to\nthe pseudo-critical temperature Tpc for the QCD transition. We recently pointed out\nthat also ratios of cumulants of net baryon number fluctuations, as measured by STAR\nat different beam energies [5], agree well with HRG model calculations on the chemical\nfreeze-out curve [6]. This is shown in Fig. 1. At the same time these results are also\nconsistent with lattice QCD calculations when temperature and chemical potential in\nthese calculations is chosen to agree with the freeze-out parameters [7, 8]. This also is\nshown in Fig. 1.\n\n\f2\n\nCharge fluctuations and freeze-out in heavy ion collisions\n10.0\n\n\u03c32B/MB\n\n\u03baB\u03c32B\n\n1.0\n\nSTAR\nHRG\nLGT, NLO in \u03bcB\n\nSB\u03c3 B\ns1/2\nNN [GeV]\n\n0.1\n5\n\n10\n\n20\n\n50\n\n100\n\n200\n\nFigure 1. Ratios of cumulants of net baryon number fluctuations measured by\nSTAR [5] and calculated in a HRG model [6]. The lattice QCD results [8] have been\ndetermined from a next-to-leading order Taylor expansion of cumulants calculated at\nthe values of the freeze-out chemical potential determined from the HRG model. The\nfreeze-out temperature at \u03bcB = 0 has been assumed to coincide with the crossover\ntemperature determined in lattice calculations.\n\nThe HRG model, of course, is not sensitive to critical behavior. The agreement of\ncurrent lattice calculations with HRG model calculations of ratios of cumulants including\nup to fourth order fluctuations thus also indicates that they present so far no compelling\nevidence for critical behavior. We recently argued that a determination of sixth order\ncumulants may be particularly helpful in this respect as they clearly deviate from HRG\nmodel calculations in the crossover region of QCD and start to become sensitive to\ncritical behavior earlier in the hadronic phase [9]. In the following we will point out some\ngeneric features of higher order cumulants in QCD that arise from universal properties\nof QCD close to the chiral limit of vanishing light quark masses, mq \u2261 mu = md = 0.\n2. O(4) universality\nAt vanishing baryon chemical potential (\u03bcB ), as well as in a certain range 0 \u2264 \u03bcB \u2264 \u03bccB ,\nQCD is expected to undergo a second order phase transition for mq \u2261 0. In this\nentire range of \u03bcB values the chiral phase transition belongs to the universality class\nof 3-dimensional, O(4) symmetric spin models. In the vicinity of the chiral phase\ntransition temperature (Tc (\u03bc\u0304B )) thermodynamic quantities show universal properties\nthat are controlled by the singular part, ff , of the free energy. For a fixed value of the\nchemical potential \u03bc\u0304B < \u03bccB , close to Tc (\u03bc\u0304B ) the free energy may be parametrized as,\nf (T, \u03bcB , mq ) = h2\u2212\u03b1 ff (z) + fr (T, \u03bcB , mq ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith z \u2261 t/h1/\u03b2\u03b4 denoting the particular scaling combination of the reduced temperature\nt \u223c (T \u2212 Tc (\u03bc\u0304B ))/Tc (\u03bc\u0304B ) + \u03baB ((\u03bcB /T )2 \u2212 (\u03bc\u0304B /T )2 ) and the symmetry breaking\nparameter h, which for QCD is taken to be the ratio of light and strange quark\nmasses, h \u223c mq /ms ; \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4 denote critical exponents of the 3-d, O(4) universality\nclass.

In Fig. 2 (left) we show this scaling\nfunction for the 3-d, O(4) universality class which recently has been extracted from high\nstatistics spin model calculations [10]. The right hand part of this figure shows how the\nsingular contribution strengthens as the symmetry breaking parameter h is reduced.\nIt is evident from Fig. 2(right) that the universal scaling properties of cumulants\nwill, for sufficiently small values of the quark mass, induce negative values for cumulants\nalready for n = 3. However, as shown in Eq. 2, the contribution from the singular part is\nweighted by a factor proportional to (\u03bcB /T )3 . Its contribution to the total value of the\ncumulant may thus be small for small values of \u03bcB /T and non-zero values of the quark\nmass. Nonetheless, negative values for 3rd and 4th order moments have been found in\nmodel calculations [9, 11]\u2021\nThe first cumulant, which is not parametrically suppressed by powers of \u03bcB /T and\nthus stays finite even at \u03bcB = 0 is the sixth order cumulant of net baryon number\nfluctuations. This cumulant changes sign in the crossover region of the QCD transition.\nAlthough the temperature at which the sixth order cumulant changes sign is not a\nuniversal quantity there are strong indications from lattice [4] as well as model [9]\ncalculations that the change of sign occurs close to the chiral transition temperature.\nThis is shown in Fig. 3. In fact, for sufficiently small values of the quark mass, i.e.,\nin the O(4) scaling regime, the location of the minimum of the sixth order cumulant\n\u2021 Close to the chiral critical point the negative values of fourth order cumulants that arise from O(4)\ncriticality compete with similar effects that arise from Z(2) critical behavior and also lead to negative\nfourth order cumulants [12].\n\n\f4\n\nCharge fluctuations and freeze-out in heavy ion collisions\n8\n\n0.04\n\n6\n\n6\u03c7B\n6\n\n4\n\n2\u03c7Q\n6\n\n2\n\n\u03c7S\n6\n\n0.03\n0.02\n\n\u03bcB/T=0\n\n0.01\n0.00\n\nSB\n\n0\n\n\u03c7B\n6\n\n-0.01\n-0.02\n\n-2\n\n-0.03\n-4\n\n-0.04\n\nT [MeV]\n\n-6\n\n180 200 220 240 260 280 300 320\n\n-0.05\n\nT/Tpc\n0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3\n\nFigure 3.

The latter appears at a somewhat higher temperature [10].\nFor \u03bcB /T > 0 the onset of negative values for \u03c7B\n6 indeed follows the crossover line for\nthe QCD transition [9, 13].\n3. Conclusions\nSixth order cumulants are thus expected to change sign at a temperature below the\n(pseudo-critical) chiral transition temperature. This effect should become visible even\nat the LHC and the highest RHIC energy if chemical freeze out indeed occurs close to the\nQCD transition temperature and if higher moments probe these freeze out conditions.\nAcknowledgments\nThis manuscript has been authored under contract number DE-AC02-98CH10886 with\nthe U.S. Department of Energy.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\nF.
