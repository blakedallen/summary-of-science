Early attempts to quantise the Hamiltonian formulation given by Arnowitt,\nDeser and Misner [1] have failed due to non-renormalisability [2, 3] among other problems. Supergravity in various dimensions entered the picture as a way to resolve these problems, however,\nnot all could be addressed [4, 5, 6]. Meanwhile, Superstring theory [7, 8] and M-Theory [9, 10]\nhave been proposed as theories of quantum gravity. They constrain the spacetime dimension to\nD + 1 = 10 (Superstring theory) or D + 1 = 11 (M-Theory) and symmetry arguments suggest\nthat the respective Supergravities are their low energy limits [7, 8]. It is therefore interesting\nto (loop)-quantise these Supergravities as a new approach to quantising the low-energy limit of\nSuperstring theory or M-theory.\nHowever, the programme of loop quantisation (see e.g. [11] and references therein) requires\nthe theory to be formulated in terms of a gauge theory. The reason for that is that only for\ntheories based on connections and conjugate momenta background independent Hilbert space\nrepresentations have been found so far, which also support the constraints of the theory as\ndensely defined and closable operators. Of course, a connection formulation is also forced on us\nif we want to treat fermionic matter as well. A connection formulation for gravity in D + 1 > 4\nthat can be satisfactorily quantised, even in the vacuum case, has not been given so far. For\nthe case D + 1 = 4, it was only in 1986 that Ashtekar discovered his new variables for General\nRelativity [12]. The most important property of these variables is that the connection A used\nhas a canonically conjugate momentum E such that (A, E) have standard canonical brackets,\nin particular the connection Poisson commutes with itself. This is not trivial. Indeed, the\nnaive connection that one would expect from the first order Palatini formulation does not have\nthis crucial property, because the canonical formulation of Palatini gravity suffers from second\nclass constraints and the Palatini connection then has non trivial corresponding Dirac brackets.\nThis prohibited so far to find Hilbert space representations, in particular those of LQG type in\nwhich the connection is represented as a multiplication operator, for these Palatini connection\nformulations. The Ashtekar connection does not suffer from this problem because it is the\n2\n\n\fself-dual part of the Palatini connection (or spin connection in the absence of torsion terms).\nUnfortunately, for the only physically interesting case of Lorentzian signature this Ashtekar\nconnection takes values in the non compact SL(2, C) rather than a compact group and again\nit is very difficult to find Hilbert space representations of gauge theories with non compact\nstructure groups.\nAs observed by Barbero [13], a possible strategy to deal with this non compactness problem\nis to use the time gauge and to gauge fix the boost part of SO(1, 3). The resulting connection,\nwhich can be seen as the self dual part of the spin connection for Euclidean signature, is then an\nSU(2) connection. The price to pay is that the Hamiltonian constraint for Lorentzian signature in\nterms of these variables is more complicated than in terms of the complex valued ones. However,\nthis does not pose any problems in its quantisation [14]. Using these variables (which also allow\na one parameter freedom related to the Immirzi parameter [15]) a rigorous quantisation of\nGeneral Relativity with a unique Hilbert space representation could be derived [16, 17, 18, 19].\nA different way to arrive at the same formulation is to start from the geometrodynamics phase\nspace coordinatised by the ADM variables (three metric and extrinsic curvature) and to expand it\nby introducing (densitised) triads E and conjugate momenta K (basically the extrinsic curvature\ncontracted with the triad). The connection is then the triad spin connection \u0393 plus this conjugate\nmomentum, that is, A = \u0393 + \u03b3K where \u03b3 is the real valued Immirzi parameter. The first miracle\nthat happens in 3 spatial dimensions is that this is at all possible: While K transforms in the\ndefining representation of SO(3), \u0393 transforms in the adjoint representation of SO(3). But for\nthe case of SO(3), these are isomorphic and enable to define the object A. The second miracle\nthat happens in 3 spatial dimensions is that this connection is Poisson self commuting which is\nentirely non trivial. Notice that in three spatial dimensions, the expansion of the phase space\nalters the number of configuration degrees of freedom from six per spatial point (described by\nthe three metric tensor) to nine (described by the co-triad). To get back to the original ADM\nphase space, one therefore has to add three constraints and these turn out to comprise precisely\nan SU(2) Gauss constraints just as in Yang Mills theory.\nIt is clear that this strategy can work only in D = 3 spatial dimensions: A metric in D spatial\ndimensions has D(D + 1)/2 configuration degrees of freedom per spatial point while a D-bein\nhas D2 . We therefore need D2 \u2212 D(D + 1)/2 = D(D \u2212 1)/2 constraints which is precisely the\ndimensionality of SO(D). However, an SO(D) connection has D2 (D \u2212 1)/2 degrees of freedom.\nRequiring that connection and triad have equal amount of degrees of freedom leads to the\nunique solution D = 3. Thus in higher dimensions we need a generalisation of the procedure\nthat works in D = 3. Attempts to construct a higher dimensional connection formulation have\nbeen undertaken, but few results are available [20, 21, 22, 23]. Han et al. [24] have shown\nthat the higher dimensional Palatini action leads to geometrodynamics when the time gauge is\nimposed before the canonical analysis.\nIn this paper, we will derive a connection formulation for higher dimensional General Relativity by using a different extension of the ADM phase space than the one employed in [12, 25]\nand which generalises to arbitrary spacetime dimension D + 1 for D > 1. It is based in part\non Peldan's seminal work [26] on the possibility of using higher dimensional gauge groups for\ngravity as well as on his concept of a hybrid spin connection which naturally appears in the\nconnection formulation of 2 + 1 gravity [27]. More precisely, the idea is the following:\nIf one starts from the Palatini formulation in D+1 spacetime dimensions, then the natural gauge\ngroup to consider is SO(1, D) or SO(D + 1) respectively for Lorentzian or Euclidean gravity respectively. Both groups have dimension D(D + 1)/2. This motivates to look for a connection\nformulation of the Hamiltonian framework with a connection AaIJ , a = 1, .., D; I, J = 0, .., D.\nSuch a connection has D2 (D + 1)/2 degrees of freedom. The corresponding Gauss constraint\nremoves D(D + 1)/2 degrees of freedom, leaving us with (D \u2212 1)D(D + 1)/2 degrees of freedom.\n3\n\n\fHowever, a metric in D spatial dimensions has only D(D + 1)/2 degrees of freedom, which\nmeans that we need D2 (D \u2212 1)/2 \u2212 D additional constraints which together with the ADM\nconstraints and the Gauss constraint form a first class system. To discover this constraint, we\nneed an object that transforms in the defining representation of the gauge group. It is given\nby the \"square root\" of the spatial metric qab = \u03b7IJ eIa eJb where \u03b7 has Lorentzian or Euclidean\nsignature respectively. Since the D internal vectors eIa are linearly independent, we can complete them to a uniquely defined (D + 1)-bein by the unit vector eI0 where \u03b7IJ eIa eJ0 = 0. Now\nthe momentum \u03c0 aIJ conjugate to AaIJ is supposed to be entirely determined by eIa , that is,\np\n[I J]\n\u03c0 aIJ \u221d det(q)q ab e0 eb . In other words, \u03c0 is \"simple\" and we call these constraints therefore\nsimplicity constraints. Since eIa has D(D + 1) degrees of freedom while \u03c0 aIJ has D2 (D + 1)/2\nthese present precisely the required D2 (D \u2212 1)/2 \u2212 D constraints. Furthermore, from eIa one can\nconstruct the hybrid spin connection \u0393aIJ which annihilates eIa and the idea, as for Ashtekar's\nvariables, is that A \u2212 \u0393 is related to the extrinsic curvature. In order to show that the symplectic reduction of this extension of the ADM phase is given by the ADM phase space, similar to\nwhat happens in case of Ashtekar's variables, we need that \u0393 is integrable at least modulo the\nsimplicity constraints which we show to be the case.\nIt should be stressed that even in D + 1 = 4 this extension of the ADM phase space is different from the one employed in LQG: In LQG the Ashtekar-Barbero connection is given by\nI\nI\nl\nALQG\najk \u2212 \u0393ajk \u221d \u000fjkl Ka , i, j, k = 1, ..., D, while in our case in the time gauge e0 = \u03b40 we have\nNEW\nAajk \u2212 \u0393ajk is pure gauge. Here \u0393ajk is the spin connection of the corresponding triad. Thus,\nin the new formulation the information about the extrinsic curvature sits in the Aa0j component\nwhich is absent in the LQG formulation. We also emphasise that it is possible to have gauge\ngroup SO(D + 1) even for the Lorentzian ADM phase space. While a Lagrangian formulation is\nonly available when spacetime and internal signature match as we will see in a companion paper\n[28], this opens the possibility to quantise gravity in D + 1 spacetime dimensions using LQG\nmethods albeit with structure group SO(D + 1) and additional (simplicity) constraints [29, 30].\nThis paper is is organised as follows:\nIn section 2, we will define the required kinematical structure of a (D + 1)-dimensional connection formulation of General Relativity. We will study in detail the properties of the simplicity\nconstraint and the hybrid spin connection.\nIn section 3, we will postulate an extension of the ADM phase space in terms of a connection\nand its conjugate momentum subject to the corresponding Gauss constraint and the simplicity\nconstraint discussed before. We will then prove that the symplectic reduction of this extension\nwith respect to both constraints recovers the ADM phase space. There is a one parameter\nfreedom in this extension, similar to but different from the Immirzi parameter of standard LQG\n[15].\nIn section 4, we express the spatial diffeomorphism constraint and the Hamiltonian constraint\nin terms of the new variables and prove that the full set of four types of constraints, namely Gauss,\nsimplicity, spatial diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints, is of first class. This can be done\nfor either choice of SO(1, D) or SO(D + 1) independently of the spacetime signature. Similar\nto the situation with standard LQG, the Hamiltonian simplifies when spacetime signature and\ninternal signature match if one chooses unit Immirzi like parameter. There is an additional\ncorrection term present which accounts for the removal of the pure gauge degrees of freedom\naffected by the gauge transformations generated by the simplicity constraint.\nIn section 5, we conclude and discuss future research directions partly already addressed in\nour companion papers [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33].\n\n4\n\n\fThe further organisation of this series is as follows:\nIn paper [28], we supplement the present paper by a Lagrangian, namely Palatini, formulation in the case that internal and spacetime signature match. As is well known, the canonical\ntreatment of Palatini gravity, while leading to a connection formulation, is plagued by second\nclass constraints and a non trivial Dirac bracket prohibiting a connection representation in the\nquantum theory [34]. This is in apparent contradiction to the first class structure found in the\npresent paper. The link between the two approaches is through the machinery of gauge unfixing\n[35, 36, 37, 38], which transforms a second class system into an equivalent first class system subject to a modification of the Hamiltonian which in our case is precisely the additional correction\nterm in the Hamiltonian constraint found in this paper.\nIn paper [29] we quantise the constraints found in this paper using the standard machinery\ndeveloped for the D = 3 case. In paper [31], we consider coupling to fermionic matter and its\nquantisation where we have to solve the problem of how to switch from Lorentzian to Euclidean\nsignature Clifford algebras. In paper [30], we quantise the simplicity constraint and show that\nin D + 1 = 4 the resulting Hilbert space and the representation of Gauss and simplicity invariant\nobservables coincides with the standard LQG representation. In paper [32], we consider the\nclassical canonical formulation of higher dimensional Supergravity theories, in particular the\nRarita-Schwinger fields in terms of new canonical variables and formulate the corresponding\nquantum theory. Finally, we treat the p-form sector of Supergravity theories in paper [33].\n\n2\n\nKinematical Structure of (D +1)-dimensional Canonical Gravity\n\nThis section is subdivided into three parts. In the first part we show that simple dimensional\ncounting and natural considerations lead to a unique candidate connection formulation that\nworks in any spacetime dimension D + 1 and has underlying structure group SO(D + 1) or\nSO(1, D) respectively. We also identify the simplicity constraints additional to the Gauss constraint that such a formulation requires and show that while there is no D-bein and no spin\nconnection in such a formulation, there is a generalised D-bein and a hybrid connection. The\nlatter is required in order to express the ADM variables in terms of the connection and its conjugate momentum. In the second part we formulate an equivalent expression for the simplicity\nconstraint and discuss its properties and some subtleties. Finally, in the third part we prove a\nkey property of the hybrid connection, namely its integrability modulo simplicity constraints.\nThis will be key to proving in the next section that the symplectic reduction of the extended\nphase space by Gauss and simplicity constraints recovers the ADM phase space.\n\n2.1\n\nPreliminaries\n\nAs is well known (see e.g. [11] and references therein), the ADM Hamiltonian formulation\nof vacuum D + 1 General Relativity is based on a phase space coordinatised by a canonical\npair (qab , P ab ) with non trivial Poisson brackets (we set the gravitational constant to unity for\nconvenience)\nc\nd (D)\n{qab (x), P cd (y)} = \u03b4(a\n\u03b4b)\n\u03b4 (x \u2212 y),\n(2.1)\nwhere a, b, c, .. \u2208 {1, .., D} and x, y, .. are coordinates on a D-dimensional manifold \u03c3. The images\nof \u03c3 under one parameter families of embeddings of \u03c3 into a (D + 1)-dimensional manifold M\nconstitute a foliation of M . Here qab is a metric on \u03c3 of Euclidean signature. The phase space\n\n5\n\n\fdefined by (2.1) is subject to spatial diffeomorphism constraints\nHa = \u22122qac Db P bc\n\n(2.2)\n\np\n1\ns\n[qac qbd \u2212\nH = \u2212p\nqab qcd ]P ab P cd \u2212 det(q)R(D) ,\nD\u22121\ndet(q)\n\n(2.3)\n\nand Hamiltonian constraint\n\nwhere R(D) is the Ricci scalar of qab and Da denotes the torsion free covariant derivative annihilating qab . Here s is the signature of the spacetime geometry. Expression (2.3) is problematic\nfor D = 1 and in what follows we restrict to D > 1.\nSimilar to the formulation of standard LQG in D + 1 = 4, we would like to arrive at\na connection formulation of this system which then can be quantised using standard LQG\ntechniques. This requires the corresponding structure group to be compact. Let us recall and\nsketch how this is done for D = 3, see [11] for all the details:\nFollowing Peldan [26], the idea is to extend the ADM phase space by additional degrees of\nfreedom and then to impose additional first class constraints in such a way that the symplectic\nreduction of the extended system with respect to these constraints coincides with the original\nADM phase space. In practical terms, this means that one considers a connection A\u03b1a , i.e. a\nLie algebra valued one form with a Lie algebra of dimension N and a conjugate momentum \u03c0\u03b1a\nwhich is a Lie algebra valued vector density. Here \u03b1, \u03b2, .. = 1, .., N . Such a Yang-Mills phase\nspace is subject to a Gauss constraint\nG\u03b1 = Da \u03c0\u03b1a = \u2202a \u03c0\u03b1a + f\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u03b3\n\nA\u03b2a \u03c0\u03b3a ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere f\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3 denote the structure constants of the corresponding gauge group. The requirement is\nthen that there is a reduction (A, \u03c0) 7\u2192 qab := qab [A, \u03c0], P ab := P ab [A, \u03c0] such that the Poisson\nbrackets of the ADM phase space are reproduced modulo the Gauss constraint and possible\nadditional first class constraints that maybe necessary in order that the correct dimensionality\nof the reduced phase space is achieved.\nThe question is of course which group should be chosen depending on D and how to express\nqab , P ab in terms of A\u03b1a , \u03c0\u03b1a . Furthermore, one may ask whether the Gauss constraint is sufficient\nin order to reduce to the correct number of degrees of freedom or whether there should be\nadditional constraints. Consider first the case that the Gauss constraint is sufficient. Then the\nextended phase space has DN configuration degrees of freedom of which the Gauss constraint\nremoves N . This has to agree with the dimension of the ADM configuration degrees of freedom\nwhich in D spatial dimensions is D(D+1)/2. It follows N (D\u22121) = D(D+1)/2. Next we need to\nrelate (A\u03b1a , \u03c0\u03b1a ) to (qab , P ab ). There may be many possibilities for doing so but here we will follow\na strategy that is similar to the strategy of standard LQG. We consider some representation\n\u03c1 of the corresponding Lie group G of dimension M \u2265 D and introduce generalised D-beins\neIa , I, J, K, ... = 1, .., M taking values in this representation with qab = eIa \u03b7IJ eJb . The requirement\nM \u2265 D is needed in order that qab can be chosen to be non degenerate and we furthermore\nrequire that it is positive definite. Here \u03b7 is a G-invariant tensor, i.e. \u03c1(g)IK \u03b7IJ \u03c1(g)JL = \u03b7KL .\nThe existence of such a tensor already severely restricts the possible choices of G and typically\nG is simply defined in this way whence \u03c1 will typically be the defining representation of G.\nWe extend the covariant derivative Da to \u03c1 valued objects by asking that Da annihilates the\nco-D-bein\nDa eIb = \u2202a eIb \u2212 \u0393cab eIc + \u0393\u03b1a [X\u03b1\u03c1 ]I J eJb = 0,\n(2.5)\nwith the Levi-Civita connection \u0393cab . This equation defines the hybrid (or generalised) spin\nconnection \u0393\u03b1a . Here the X\u03b1\u03c1 denote the generators of the Lie algebra of G in the representation\n\u03c1.\n6\n\n\fthat p\nK\u0303a b := [A\u03b1a \u2212 \u0393\u03b1a ]\u03c0\u03b1b is the expression for the ADM extrinsic curvature\np The ideab is now\ndet(q)Ka , Pa b = \u2212s det(q)[Ka b \u2212 \u03b4ab Kc c ], in terms of the new variables. However, there\nare several caveats. First of all, it is not clear that (2.5) has a non-trivial solution: These are\nD2 M equations for DN coefficients \u0393\u03b1a and thus the system (2.5) could be overdetermined.\nSecondly, even if a solution exists, \u0393\u03b1a will be a function of eIa while we need to express it in\nterms of the momentum \u03c0\u03b1a conjugate to A\u03b1a . If there is no other constraint than the Gauss\nconstraint, then \u03c0\u03b1a itself must be already determined in terms of eIa which implies that M = N :\nThe representation \u03c1 has the same dimension as the adjoint representation of the Lie group.\nIf one scans the classical Lie groups, then the only case where the defining representation and\nthe adjoint representation have the same dimension (and are in fact isomorphic) is SO(3) or\nSO(1, 2) respectively, whence N = 3. In this case, the equation N (D \u2212 1) = D(D + 1)/2 has the\nsolutions D = 2 and D = 3 which can be shown to be the only solutions to this equation on the\npositive integers.\nIn order to go beyond D = 3, we therefore need more constraints. We consider now the case of\nthe choice G = SO(M +1) or G = SO(1, M ) which is motivated by the fact that these Lie groups\nunderly the Palatini formulation of General Relativity in M +1 spacetime dimensions. Following\nPeldan's programme, other choices may be leading, conceivably, to canonical formulations of\nGUT theories. We will leave the investigation of such possibilities for future research. For this\nchoice we obtain N = M (M +1)/2 and thus (2.5) presents D2 (M +1) equations for DM (M +1)/2\ncoefficients. Explicitly\n(2.6)\n\u2202a eIb \u2212 \u0393cab eIc + \u0393IJ\na ebJ = 0,\nwhere all internal indices are moved with \u03b7. Since \u0393a(IJ) = 0 we obtain the consistency condition\ne(cI \u2202a eIb) \u2212 \u0393(c|a|b) = 0,\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere qab = eIa ebI was used. It is not difficult to see that (2.7) is in fact identically satisfied.\nTherefore the D2 (M +1) equations (2.6) are not all independent, there are D2 (D+1)/2 identities\n(2.7) among them, reducing the number of independent equations to D2 [M + 1 \u2212 21 (D + 1)] for\nDM (M +1)/2 coefficients \u0393aIJ . Equating the number of independent equations to the number of\nequations yields a quadratic equation for M with the two possible roots M = D and M = D \u2212 1.\nIn the second case eIa is an ordinary D-bein and \u0393aIJ its ordinary spin connection. In the former\ncase we obtain the hybrid spin connection mentioned before.\nLet us discuss the cases SO(D) and SO(D + 1) separately (the discussion is analogous for\nSO(1, D\u22121) and SO(1, D) except that SO(1, D\u22121) does not allow for a positive definite D metric\nand therefore must be excluded anyway). In the case of SO(D) we have D2 (D\u22121)/2 configuration\ndegrees of freedom and D(D \u2212 1)/2 Gauss constraints. In order to match the number of ADM\ndegrees of freedom, we therefore need S = D2 (D\u22121)/2\u2212D(D\u22121)/2\u2212D(D+1)/2 = D2 (D\u22123)/2\nadditional constraints. These must be imposed on the momentum \u03c0 aIJ conjugate to AaIJ and\nrequire that \u03c0 aIJ is already determined by eIa . Now eIa has D2 degrees of freedom while \u03c0 aIJ\nhas D2 (D \u2212 1)/2 so that exactly S degrees of freedom are superfluous. However, there is no\naIJ with \u03c0 a(IJ) = 0 from eI : In order to match the density weight\nway to to build an object\na\np \u03c0\naI\nwe can consider E = det(q)q ab eIb , but we cannot algebraically build another object v I from\neIa without tensor index in order to define \u03c0 aIJ = v [I E a|J] . The only solution is that there\nare no superfluous degrees of freedom, which leads back to D = 3. Now consider SO(D + 1).\nIn this case we have D2 (D + 1)/2 configuration degrees of freedom and D(D + 1)/2 Gauss\nconstraints requiring S = D2 (D + 1)/2 \u2212 D(D + 1)/2 \u2212 D(D + 1)/2 = D2 (D \u2212 1)/2 \u2212 D\nadditional constraints. The number of superfluous degrees of freedom in \u03c0 aIJ as compared to\neIa is now also precisely S = D2 (D + 1)/2 \u2212 D(D + 1). In contrast to the previous case, however,\nnow it is possible to construct an object without tensor indices: If we assume that the D internal\n7\n\n\fvectors eIa , a = 1, .., D are linearly independent then we construct the common normal\nnI :=\n\n1\n1\nD\np\n\u000fa1 ..aD \u000fIJ1 ..JD eJa11 .. eJaD\n,\nD! det(q)\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhich satisfies eIa nI = 0, nI nI = \u03b6 where \u03b6 = 1 for SO(D + 1) and \u03b6 = \u22121 for SO(1, D). Notice\nthat nI is uniquely (up to sign) determined by eIa . We may now require that\np\nJ]\n\u03c0 aIJ = 2 det(q)q ab n[I eb =: 2n[I E a|J] .\n(2.9)\nThese are the searched for constraints on \u03c0 aIJ and constitutes our candidate connection formulation for General Relativity in arbitrary spacetime dimensions D + 1 \u2265 3. Since they\nrequire \u03c0 to come from a generalised D-bein, we call them simplicity constraints. Notice that\nD2 (D \u2212 1)/2 \u2212 D = 0 for D = 2. Indeed, 2 + 1 gravity is naturally defined as an SO(1, 2) or\nSO(3) gauge theory.\n\n2.2\n\nProperties of the Simplicity Constraints\n\nThe form of the constraint (2.9) is not yet satisfactory because the constraint should be formulated purely in terms of \u03c0 aIJ . The same requirement applies to the hybrid connection to which\nwe will turn in the next subsection.\nGiven \u03c0 aIJ and any unit vector nI we may define E aI [\u03c0, n] := \u2212\u03b6\u03c0 aIJ nJ . This object then\nautomatically satisfies E aI nI = 0. Furthermore we may define the transversal projector\n\u03b7\u0304JI [n] := \u03b4JI \u2212 \u03b6nI nJ \u21d2 \u03b7\u0304JI nJ = 0\n\n(2.10)\n\nI\n\u03c0\u0304 aIJ := \u03b7\u0304K\n[n] \u03b7\u0304LJ [n] \u03c0 aKL .\n\n(2.11)\n\nand define\nIn what follows, all tensors with purely transversal components will carry an overbar. We obtain\nthe decomposition\n\u03c0 aIJ = \u03c0\u0304 aIJ + 2n[I E a|J] .\n(2.12)\nIt appears that the simplicity constraint now is equivalent to \u03c0\u0304 aIJ = 0. However, there are two\nsubtleties: First, at this point nI is an extra structure next to \u03c0 aIJ which is required to define\n(2.11). Therefore the decomposition (2.12) is not intrinsic and nI appears as an extra degree of\nfreedom. It is therefore necessary to give an intrinsic definition of nI . Next, suppose that we\nhave achieved to do so, then \u03c0\u0304 aIJ constitute D2 (D \u2212 1)/2 degrees of freedom rather than the\nrequired D2 (D \u2212 1)/2 \u2212 D while due to EIa nI = 0 the EIa constitute only D2 degrees of freedom\nrather than D(D + 1).\nTo remove these subtleties, it is cleaner to adopt the following point of view:\nWe consider D+1 vector densities EIa to begin with such that the corresponding D(D + 1)-matrix\nhas maximal rank. From these we can construct the densitised inverse metric\nQab := EIa EJb \u03b7 IJ ,\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhich we require to have Euclidean signature as well as their common normal\nnI [E] :=\n\n1\np\n\u000fa1 ..aD \u000fIJ1 ..JD E a1 J1 ..E aD JD ,\nD! det(Q)\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhich is now considered as a function of E. Notice that nI nI = \u03b6. Therefore also \u03b7\u0304JI = \u03b7\u0304JI [E] is\na function of E. We can again apply the decomposition (2.12) and now have cleanly deposited\n8\n\n\fthe searched for degrees of freedom into EIa . However, while nI is now intrinsically defined via\nEIa , the constraints \u03c0\u0304 aIJ = 0 are still D to many. We should remove D additional degrees of\nfreedom from \u03c0\u0304 aIJ . To do so we impose a tracefree condition. Consider the object\nEaI := Qab E bI , Qac Qcb := \u03b4ab .\n\n(2.15)\n\nIt follows easily from the definitions that\nEaI EIb = \u03b4ab , EaI EJa = \u03b7\u0304JI .\n\n(2.16)\n\nConsider the tracefree, transverse projector\nJ\naIJ\nI\n\u2212\n\u03b7\u0304L]\nPbKL\n[E] := \u03b4ba \u03b7\u0304[K\n\n2\nJ]\nE a[I Eb[K \u03b7\u0304L] .\nD\u22121\n\n(2.17)\n\naIJ \u03c0 aIJ that\nThen for any tensor \u03c0 aIJ we have with \u03c0\u0304TaIJ = PbKL\n\n\u03c0\u0304 J := EaI \u03c0\u0304TaIJ = 0\n\n(2.18)\n\nand \u03c0\u0304TaIJ nI = 0. Notice that \u03c0\u0304TaIJ has only D2 (D \u2212 1)/2 \u2212 D degrees of freedom independent of\nEIa .\nWe therefore consider in what follows tensors \u03c0 aIJ of the following form\n\u03c0 aIJ [E, S\u0304T ] := S\u0304TaIJ + 2n[I [E] E a|J] ,\n\n(2.19)\n\nwhere S\u0304T and E are considered as independent parameters for \u03c0. Notice that S\u0304T can be\nconstructed as P * S from an arbitrary tensor S aIJ . Such tensors can be intrinsically described\nas follows:\nGiven \u03c0, there exists a normal nI [\u03c0] such that the following holds: Define EIa [\u03c0, n] = \u2212\u03b6\u03c0 aIJ nJ\nand \u03c0\u0304 aIJ [\u03c0, n] as above. Then automatically\n\u03c0\u0304 J [\u03c0, n] := \u03c0\u0304 aIJ [\u03c0, n]Qab [\u03c0, n]EIb [\u03c0, n] = 0.\n\n(2.20)\n\nThis is a set of D independent (since automatically \u03c0\u0304 I nI = 0 no matter what nI is), non-linear\nequations for the D independent (due to the normalisation nI nI = \u03b6) components of nI . In the\nappendix, we study this non trivial system of equations further and show that it can possibly be\nsolved by fixed point methods. At present we do not know whether at least tensors \u03c0 aIJ subject\nb /2 is positive definite always allow for such a solution nI , however,\nto the condition that \u03b6\u03c0 aIJ \u03c0IJ\nwe know that the number of possible solutions is always finite because we can transform (2.20)\ninto a system of polynomial equations. In what follows, we will assume that the solution nI [\u03c0]\nis in fact unique by suitably restricting the set of allowed tensors \u03c0 aIJ . This could imply that\nthe set of such tensors no longer has the structure of a vector space which however does not\npose any problems for what follows.\nOn the other hand, we can prove the following for general \u03c0 aIJ :\n\n9\n\n\fTheorem.\nLet D \u2265 3 and1\n\n1\nab\nSM\n:= \u000fIJKLM \u03c0 aIJ \u03c0 bKL ,\n4\n\n(2.21)\n\nwhere M is any totally skew (D \u2212 3)-tuple of indices in {0, 1, .., D}. Then\nab\nSM\n= 0 \u2200 M , a, b\n\naIJ\n\u21d4 PbKL\n[\u03c0, n] \u03c0 bKL = 0\n\n(2.22)\n\naIJ [\u03c0, n] := [P aIJ [E]]\naI\naIJ n and\nfor any unit vector n where PbKL\nJ\nE=E[\u03c0,n] and E [\u03c0, n] = \u2212\u03b6\u03c0\nbKL\nwhere P [E] is defined in (2.17). Here we assume that Qab [\u03c0, n] := \u03c0 aIK \u03c0 bJL \u03b7IJ nK nL is non\ndegenerate for any (timelike for \u03b6 = \u22121) vector nI .\n\u0001\nab are D(D +1)/2 D+1 equations which exceeds D 2 (D \u2212\nThis result implies that although SM\n4\nab = 0 does not\n1)/2 \u2212 D for D > 3 only D2 (D \u2212 1)/2 of them are independent. The constraint SM\nfix nI and makes no statement about the trace part \u03c0\u0304 J [\u03c0, n] = \u03c0\u0304 aIJ [\u03c0, n]EaI [\u03c0, n]. Given that the\ntheorem holds for any n it is natural to fix n such that the trace part vanishes simultaneously as\notherwise we would have only that \u03c0\u0304 aIJ = 2E a[I \u03c0\u0304 J] /(D\u22121) and not \u03c0\u0304 aIJ = 0 or \u03c0 aIJ = 2n[I E a|J]\non the constraint surface of the simplicity constraint.\n\nProof.\nObviously\n\u03b6\n4! (D \u2212 3)! \u03c0 a[IJ \u03c0 bKL] = 0.\n4\nGiven \u03c0, consider any unit vector n and decompose as in (2.12)\nab\nab\nSM\n= 0 \u21d4 \u000fIJKLM SM\n=\n\n\u03c0 aIJ = \u03c0\u0304 aIJ [\u03c0, n] + 2n[I E a|J] [\u03c0, n].\n\n(2.23)\n\n(2.24)\n\nInserting into (2.24), we obtain\n\u03c0 a[IJ \u03c0 bKL] = \u03c0\u0304 a[IJ \u03c0\u0304 bKL] + 4n[I E (a|J \u03c0\u0304 b)KL] = 0.\n\n(2.25)\n\nContracting with nI yields\nE (a[J \u03c0\u0304 b)KL] = 0.\n\n(2.26)\n\nContracting further with EaJ yields\n(D \u2212 1) [\u03c0\u0304 bKL \u2212\n\n2\nbKL\nE b[K \u03c0\u0304 aJ|L] EaJ ] = (D \u2212 1) PaIJ\n[\u03c0, n]\u03c0 aIJ = 0.\nD\u22121\n\nWe conclude \u03c0 aIJ = 2v [I E a|J] , v I = (nI \u2212\nthat it is identically satisfied.\n\n1\nbJI E )\nbJ\nD\u22121 \u03c0\u0304\n\n(2.27)\n\nand inserting back into (2.23) we see\n\nThe theorem therefore says that on the constraint surface \u03c0 aIJ = 2v [I E a|J] for some vector\nv which is not necessarily normalised and not necessarily normal to E aI but such that E aI , v I\nconstitute D + 1 linearly independent internal vectors. We can however draw, for \u03b6 = \u22121,\nb /(2\u03b6) should have Eusome additional conclusion from the requirement that Qab = \u03c0 aIJ \u03c0IJ\nI\nab\nclidean signature. First of all, v cannot be null since otherwise Q \u221d (EIa v I )(EJb v J ) would\nbe degenerate. If v I would be spacelike then consider \u1ebcIa = EIa \u2212 EJa v J vI /(v K vK ). It follows\n\u03c0 aIJ = 2v [I \u1ebc a|J] and Qab \u221d \u1ebc aI \u1ebcIb . Since v I , \u1ebcIa constitutes a (D + 1)-bein and v I is spacelike\nwhile \u03b7 is Lorentzian, also Qab would need to be Lorentzian. Hence v I must in fact be timelike\nfor \u03b6 = \u22121.\n1\n\nFor D = 2 no simplicity constraints are needed since D2 (D \u2212 1)/2 \u2212 D = 0.\n\n10\n\n\fa\nWe may\np signature the normalisation of v into EI and define\np therefore absorb for either\nnI := vI / \u03b6vJ v J as well as \u1ebc aI = \u03b6vK v K E aJ \u03b7\u0304JI . Then 2v [I E a|J] = 2n[I \u1ebc a|J] with \u1ebc aI nI =\n0, nI nI = \u03b6.\n\nTherefore, the constraint surface defined via (2.21) is the same as the one given by \u03c0\u0304TaIJ above,\nwhere we assumed that \u03c0 is of the form (2.19) and constitutes the unique decomposition of \u03c0 aIJ\nwith no trace part. In what follows, we will use the simplicity constraint in the form (2.21).\nHowever, it will be convenient to have the presentation (2.19) at one's disposal when we work\noff the constraint surface.\nNotice that the proof given above also in the case D = 3 does not allow for a \"topological\nsector\" \u03c0 aIJ = \u000fIJKL nK E aL or \"degenerate sector\" due to the non degeneracy assumption.\nThis assumption is dropped in the alternative proof in [28] which is based on [39] which is why\nthe topological sector does appear there.\n\n2.3\n\nIntegrability of the Hybrid Connection Modulo Simplicity Constraint\n\nab = 0. We want to define\nThe hybrid connection is defined via (2.6) on the constraint surface SM\nan extension off the constraint surface such that the resulting expression is integrable, i.e. is the\nfunctional derivative \u0393aIJ = \u03b4F/\u03b4\u03c0 aIJ of a generating functional F = F [\u03c0]. To that end, we\nneed the explicit expression of \u0393aIJ in terms of eIa .\n\nTo begin with, we notice that Da nI = 0. To see this we consider its D + 1 independent\ncomponents nI Da nI = 12 Da (nI nI ) = 0 and eIb Da nI = \u2212nI Da eIb = 0.

Its extension \u0393aIJ [\u03c0] off\nthe simplicity constraint surface therefore transforms as a G connection modulo the simplicity\nconstraint. Since both \u03c0 aIJ , KaIJ := \u03b21 (AaIJ \u2212 \u0393aIJ ) transform in the adjoint representation of\nG it is clear that Qab \u221d Tr(\u03c0 a \u03c0 b ), Kab \u221d Tr(Ka \u03c0 b ) are in fact Gauss invariant, possibly modulo\nab and q\nthe simplicity constraint, and thus are qab , P ab .

With the convention KaI := \u2212\u03b6KaIJ nJ we obtain for the Gauss constraint\nGIJ\n\n= 2\u03b2KaL[I \u03c0 a\n\nL\n\n=\n\n+ 2\u03b2K[I nJ] =: \u1e20IJ + 2n[I GJ] ,\n\nJ]\na\n\u22122\u03b6\u03b2Ka[I EJ]\n\na L\n\u2248 2\u03b2KaL[I (nJ] E aL \u2212 EJ]\nn )\n\n(3.16)\n\na = 0 on the\nwhere KI = E aL KaLI is the trace part of KaIJ . It follows that K\u0304I = 0 and Ka[I EJ]\nGauss constraint surface.

It is a linear combination, with coefficients\nM depending on qab , of expressions of the form\nMfabe (x)Mhcdg (y)\u03c0 f IJ (x)\u03c0 hKL (y) [{AeIJ (x), \u0393gKL (y)} \u2212 {AgKL (y), \u0393eIJ (x)}] .\n\n(3.18)\n\nWe now invoke the key result of the previous section and write \u0393aIJ = \u03b4F/\u03b4\u03c0 aIJ + SaIJ where\nSaIJ vanishes on the constraint surface of the simplicity constraint and depends at most on its\nfirst partial derivatives. It is therefore given by an expression of the form\nMp\nmn\nmn\nSgKL = \u03bbM\ngKLgmn SM + \u03bcgKLmn \u2202p SM\n\n(3.19)\n\nfor certain coefficients \u03bb, \u03bc. First of all, we notice that due to the commutativity of partial\nfunctional derivatives\n{AeIJ (x), \u03b4F/\u03b4\u03c0 gKL (y)} \u2212 {AgKL (y), \u03b4F/\u03b4\u03c0 eIJ (x)} = 0.\n\n(3.20)\n\nNext, due to the derivatives involved, the Poisson bracket is not ultralocal, however,\nwhat we\nR D\n0\nintend to prove is that {P [f ], P [f ]} \u2248 0 with the smeared functions P [f ] = d xfab P ab . Let\n0 , then the contribution from S\nMfe = fab Mfabe , Mh0g = Mhcdg fcd\ngKL in the first term of (3.18)\nbecomes after smearing\nZ\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n0g hKL M p\nD\nmn\n\u2248\nd x\ndD y Mfe (x)\u03c0 f IJ (x) Mh0g \u03c0 hKL \u03bbM\n\u2212\n[M\n\u03c0\n\u03bc\n]\n(y)}\n{AeIJ (x), SM\n,p\ngKLmn\ngKLmn\nh\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n0g hKL M p\n(m n)f\n= 4\u03b2\ndD x Mfe \u03c0 f IJ (x) Mh0g \u03c0 hKL \u03bbM\n\u03c0\n\u03bc\n]\n\u2212\n[M\ngKLmn\ngKLmn ,p \u03b4e SM (x)\nh\n\u2248 0,\n\n(3.21)\n\nwhere (3.10) was used. The calculation for the second term is similar. In conclusion, {P ab (x), P cd (y)}\nvanishes on the joint constraint surface of the Gauss and the simplicity constraint.\n\n4\n\nADM Constraints in Terms of the New Variables\n\nIt remains to express the ADM constraints in terms of the new variables. Of course we could\njust substitute for the expressions (3.4), however, this is not the most convenient form for the\nADM constraints because they involve the hybrid connection which is a complicated expression\nin terms of \u03c0. We will therefore adopt the strategy familiar from D + 1 = 4 and invoke the\ncurvature F of A. In the end, we will arrive at expressions Ha , H for spatial diffeomorphism and\nHamiltonian constraint which differ from their counterparts Ha0 , H0 , obtained by naive substitution of qab , P ab by (3.4) in (2.2), (2.3), by terms proportional to Gauss and simplicity constraints.\nThis guarantees that the algebra of Gauss, simplicity, spatial diffeomorphism an Hamiltonian constraints is of first class:\nTo see this, let us write Ha = Ha0 +Za , H = H0 +Z where Za , Z vanish on the constraint surface of\nthe simplicity and Gauss constraint. We have seen already that {S, S} = 0, {G, S} \u221d S, {G, G} \u221d\nG. We also have shown that (3.4) are weak Dirac observables with respect to S and invariant\nunder G. Since Ha0 , H0 are defined in terms of (3.4) it follows that {S, Ha0 } \u221d S, {S, H0 } \u221d S.\nAltogether therefore {S, Ha }, {S, H}, {G, Ha }, {G, H} \u221d S, G thus S, G form an ideal. Next\nwe have {Ha0 , Hb0 } \u221d Hc0 , S, G, {Ha0 , H0 } \u221d H0 , S, G, {H0 , H0 } \u221d Ha0 , S, G because the algebra of\nthe variables (3.4) is the same as that of the ADM variables modulo S, G terms and therefore the\nalgebra of the ADM constraints is reproduced modulo S, G terms. Together with what was already said, this implies that Ha , H reproduce the ADM algebra of constraints modulo S, G terms.\n17\n\n\fWe begin by deriving the relation between the hybrid curvature\nRabIJ = 2\u2202[a \u0393b]IJ + \u0393aIK \u0393b\n\nK\n\nJ\n\n\u2212 \u0393aJK \u0393b\n\nK\n\n(4.1)\n\nI\n\nand the Riemann curvature of qab . Let \u2207a be the covariant derivative compatible with qab . Then\nwe have by definition Da eIb = \u2207a eIb +\u0393a I J eJb = 0. Expanding out D = \u2207+\u0393 in the commutator\nrelation [Da , Db ]eIc = 0 and using [\u2207a , \u2207b ]eIc = Rabc d eId we find\nRabc d eId + Rab\n\nI\n\nJ\nJ ec\n\n= 0 \u21d2 Rabcd = RabIJ eIc eJd .\n\n(4.2)\n\nThis relation looks familiar from the spin connection, but we stress \u0393aIJ is not the spin connection because eIa is not a D-bein. We obtain modulo S for the Ricci scalar\nRabIJ \u03c0 aIK \u03c0 b\n\nK\n\nJ\n\nb\n\u2248 RabIJ [nI E aK \u2212 nK E aI ][nK E bJ \u2212 nJ EK\n] = \u2212\u03b6 det(q)R.\n\n(4.3)\n\nNext, using (4.2)\nRabIJ \u03c0 bIJ \u2248 2RabIJ nI E bJ = 2q bc\n\np\np\ndet(q)RabIJ nI eJc = \u22122q bc det(q)Rabc d edI nI = 0,\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhich is the analog of the algebraic Bianchi identity.\nWe now expand the curvature\nFabIJ := 2\u2202[a Ab]IJ + AaIK Ab\n\nK\n\nJ\n\n\u2212 AaJK Ab\n\nK\n\nI\n\n(4.5)\n\nJ,\n\n(4.6)\n\nof A = \u0393 + \u03b2K in terms of \u0393, K and obtain\nFabIJ = RabIJ + 2\u03b2D[a Kb]IJ + 2\u03b2 2 K[aIK Kb]\n\nK\n\nwhere torsion freeness of \u2207 = D \u2212 \u0393 was employed. Contracting (4.6) with \u03c0 bIJ we find using\n(4.4)\nFabIJ \u03c0 bIJ \u2248 2\u03b2(D[a Kb]IJ )\u03c0 bIJ \u2212 \u03b2 2 Tr([Ka , Kb ]\u03c0 b ).\n(4.7)\nThe second term is proportional to the Gauss constraint because Tr([Ka , Kb ]\u03c0 b ) = Tr(Ka [Kb , \u03c0 b ])\nand remembering (3.15). In the first term we notice that Da \u03c0 bIJ \u2248 0 so that\nFabIJ \u03c0 bIJ \u2248 \u22128s\u03b2D[a Kb]b = 4s\u03b2Db [Ka b \u2212 \u03b4ab Kc c ] = \u22124\u03b2Db Pa b = 2\u03b2Ha\n\n(4.8)\n\nis proportional to the spatial diffeomorphism constraint modulo S, G.\nNext, using (4.3)\nFabIJ \u03c0 aIK \u03c0 b\n\nK\n\nJ\n\n\u2248 \u2212\u03b6 det(q)R + 2\u03b2Da Tr(Kb [\u03c0 a , \u03c0 b ]) \u2212 \u03b2 2 Tr([Ka , Kb ]\u03c0 a \u03c0 b ).\n\n(4.9)\n\nThe second term is again proportional to the Gauss constraint, since Tr(Kb [\u03c0 a , \u03c0 b ]) = \u2212Tr(\u03c0 a [Kb , \u03c0 b ]).\nSo far all the steps were similar to the 3 + 1 situation. The difference comes in when looking at\nthe third term in (4.9)\n\u2212 Tr([Ka , Kb ]\u03c0 a \u03c0 b ) \u2248 [KaIK Kb K J \u2212 KbIK Ka K J ][nI E aL \u2212 nL E aI ][nL E bJ \u2212 nJ ELb ]\n= \u2212\u03b6[\u2212(KaIK E aI )(KbJ\n\nK\n\nE bJ ) + (KbIK E aI )(KaJ\n\nK\n\nE bJ )].\n\n(4.10)\n\nBy the Gauss constraint (3.16) we have KI = KaJI E aJ = \u03b6[KJ nJ ]nI and KJ nJ \u2248 \u2212KaIJ \u03c0 aIJ /2 =\n2sKaa . Thus the first term in (4.10) is given by 4[Kaa ]2 . However, the second term cannot be\n18\n\n\fwritten in terms of Kab . To explore the structure of the disturbing term we notice that from\nK\u0304I = 0 we have the decomposition\nT\nKaIJ = K\u0304aIJ\n+ 2n[I Ka|J] , KaI = \u2212\u03b6KaIJ nJ .\n\n(4.11)\n\nHence\n\u2212\u03b6(KbIK E aI )(KaJ\n\nK\n\nT\nT\nE bJ ) = \u2212\u03b6(K\u0304bIK\nE aI \u2212 KbI E aI nK )(K\u0304aJ\n\nT\nT\n= \u2212\u03b6(K\u0304bIK\nE aI )(K\u0304aJ\n\nK\n\nE bJ ) \u2212 4Kab Kba ,\n\nK\n\nE bJ \u2212 KaJ E bJ nK )\n(4.12)\n\nwhere KaI E bI = \u2212\u03b6KaIJ E bI nJ \u2248 KaIJ \u03c0 bIJ /(2\u03b6) was used. Altogether\nT\nT\n\u2212 Tr([Ka , Kb ]\u03c0 a \u03c0 b ) = \u22124[Kab Kba \u2212 (Kcc )2 ] \u2212 \u03b6(K\u0304bIK\nE aI )(K\u0304aJ\n\nK\n\nE bJ ).\n\n(4.13)\n\nThe first term in (4.13) has the structure that appears in the Hamiltonian constraint and can\nbe written in terms of P ab , qab , however, the second term does not appear in the Hamiltonian\nconstraint and must be removed. Also notice that the Ricci term has sign \u2212\u03b6 while the first\nterm has negative sign. If we are interested in Lorentzian Gravity then the relative sign between\nthese two terms should be negative which is not the case for the choice of a compact gauge group\n\u03b6 = 1. Therefore the expression (4.9) fails to yield the Hamiltonian constraint for several reasons.\nTo assemble the Hamiltonian constraint without making use of \u0393, the idea is to consider covariant derivatives which give access to A. Using suitable algebraic combinations then yields the\ndesired expressions. To that end, let again Da be the covariant differential of A acting only on\ninternal indices and let Da0 be its extension by the Levi-Civita connection. Consider\nDb\n\na\n\n[c\n\n:= \u03c0 aK J (Db \u03c0 cJL ) \u03c0cKL = \u03c0 aK J (Db0 \u03c0 cJL ) \u03c0cKL \u2212 2\u03c0 aK J \u03c0cKL \u0393bd \u03c0 d]JL .\n\n(4.14)\n\nThe second term equals modulo S\n[c\n\n[c\n\n\u2212 2[nK EJa \u2212 nJ E aK ][nK EcL \u2212 nL EcK ]\u0393bd \u03c0 d]JL = \u22122\u03b6 EJa EcL \u0393bd \u03c0 d]JL \u2248 0\n\n(4.15)\n\nand thus vanishes modulo S. Writing Da0 = [Da0 \u2212 Da ] + Da and noticing Da \u03c0 cJL \u2248 0 we obtain\n\u03c0 aK\n\nIt follows that\n\nJ\n\ncM L\n\n(Db \u03c0 cJL ) \u03c0cKL \u2248 \u03b6\u03b2EJa EcL [Kb\n\nJ\n\nM\u03c0\n\n\u2248 \u03b6\u03b2EJa EcL [Kb\n\nJ\n\nME\n\n= \u2212\u03b2(D \u2212 1)E\n\naJ\n\n1\n[Db\n(D \u2212 1)2\n\na\n\n+ Kb\n\ncL M\n\nn\n\nL\n\n\u2212 Kb\n\nM\nL\n\n\u03c0 cJM ]\nME\n\ncJ M\n\nn ]\n\na\n\nKbJ = 2s\u03b6\u03b2(D \u2212 1)Kb .\n\nDa b \u2212 (Dc c )2 ] \u2248 4\u03b2 2 [Kb\n\na\n\nKa b \u2212 (Kcc )2 ]\n\n(4.16)\n\n(4.17)\n\nand thus linear combinations of (4.9) and (4.17) can be used in order to produce the correct\nfactor in front of the term quadratic in the extrinsic curvature.\nIn analogy to (4.14), consider\nDaIJ := \u03c0 b[I\n\nK Db \u03c0\n\na|K|J]\n\n= \u03c0 b[I\n\n0 a|K|J]\nK Db \u03c0\n\n\u2212 2\u03c0 b[I\n\n[a c]|K|J]\n.\nK \u0393bc \u03c0\n\n(4.18)\n\nThe second term equals modulo S\n[a\n\n2\u03b6E b[I \u0393bc E c]J] = (\u2212\u03b6\u0393cbc E b[I )E aJ]\n19\n\n(4.19)\n\n\fT\nand thus is pure trace.

This is again similar to the situation in 3 + 1 dimensions. This special situation can also\nbe obtained more directly starting from the Palatini formulation as we will see in [28].\n\n20\n\n\f5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we succeeded in constructing a Hamiltonian connection formulation of General\nRelativity in all spacetime dimensions D + 1 \u2265 3 based on the gauge group SO(D + 1) or\nSO(1, D). In addition to the usual Gauss, spatial diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints,\nthere are simplicity constraints that dictate that the momentum conjugate to the connection\nis determined by a generalised D-bein. The theory can be constructed for all four possible\ncombinations of the internal (\u03b6) and spacetime (s) signature. This is especially attractive with\nan eye towards quantisation because unique [18] background independent representations of\nspatially diffeomorphism invariant theories of connections with compact structure group exist\nin any dimension and have been studied in great detail (see, e.g., [11] and references therein).\nThe techniques for quantising Gauss, spatial diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraint that\nhave been developed in 3+1 dimensions generalise to arbitrary dimensions as we will show in [29].\nThe simplicity constraint provides a challenge. A similar kind of constraint plays a prominent\nrole in Spin Foam models [40, 41, 42] and various proposals for its quantisation have been made.\nThe problem is that the quantum simplicity constraints tend to be anomalous. This is due to\nthe fact that the classically commuting \u03c0 aIJ become non commuting after discretization (Spin\nfoams) or introduction of a singular smearing (canonical approach), a property which is then\nshared by the corresponding operators in the quantum theory. In [30] we propose some new\nstrategies for how to make progress on this issue. Eventually, the solution of the simplicity\nconstraint will consist in a restriction on the set of labels for spin network functions.\nThe application of interest of the present work is of course in higher dimensional Supergravity\ntheories. Here we have to face two new technical challenges: For Lorentzian Supergravity the\naction is formulated in terms of a Lorentzian internal metric which would naturally imply the\nchoice SO(1, D). Hence, in order to keep SO(D + 1) we must carefully disassemble the SO(1, D)\nClifford algebra and reassemble it into an SO(D + 1) Clifford algebra which turns out to be\npossible. The second challenge is that higher dimensional Supergravity theories depend next\nto the Rarita-Schwinger field also on higher p-form fields for which background independent\nHilbert space representations first need to be developed.\nWhile many interesting technical issues are not settled by our analysis, the present work\nand its continuation in the companion papers hopefully contribute to the development of a non\nperturbative definition of quantum (Super)gravity in any dimension.\n\nAcknowledgements\nNB and AT thank the German National Merit Foundation for financial support.

Then it is possible to construct a tensor EIa = EIa [\u03c0] with the following properties:\nLet nI = nI [\u03c0] be the unique normal satisfying EIa nI = 0, nI nJ \u03b7IJ = \u03b6 where \u03b6 corresponds to\nI \u03b7\u0304 J \u03c0 aKL with the transversal projectors \u03b7\u0304 I = \u03b4 I \u2212 \u03b6nI n .\nthe signature of \u03b7. Let \u03c0\u0304 aIJ = \u03b7\u0304K\nJ\nL\nJ\nJ\nThen \u03c0\u0304 aIJ = \u03c0\u0304TaIJ is automatically tracefree with respect to E, that is, \u03c0\u0304 aIJ EaI = 0 where EaI\nis uniquely defined by E aI EaJ = \u03b7\u0304JI , E aI EbI = \u03b4ba . Furthermore \u03c0 aIJ = \u03c0\u0304 aIJ + 2n[I E a|J] .\nIn what follows we describe some ideas towards a possible proof.\nGiven \u03c0 aIJ , let nI be any unit vector to begin with and construct \u03b7\u0304IJ as above. Define\nE aI [\u03c0, n] := \u2212\u03b6\u03c0 aI J nJ . Notice that automatically E aI nI = 0. Then we obtain the decomposition\n\u03c0 aIJ = \u03c0\u0304 aIJ + 2n[I E a|J] .\n(A.1)\nIt is interesting to note that the non zero vector (due to the assumed linear independence)\nNI [\u03c0, n] := \u000fIJ1 ..JD \u000fa1 ..aD E a1 J1 [\u03c0, n]..E aD JD [\u03c0, n]\n\n(A.2)\n\ncoincides up to normalisation with nI no matter what \u03c0 is. Furthermore\n\u03b7 IJ NI NJ = \u03b6 [D!]2 det(Q); Qab := \u03b7 IJ EIa EJb ,\n\n(A.3)\n\nwhere \u03b6 = \u00b11 if \u03b7 has Euclidean or Lorentzian signature respectively. In particular, we verify\nthat for \u03b6 = \u22121, the vector NI is timelike, null or spacelike if and only if nI is.\nThe tensor EaI [\u03c0, n] is given, up to normalisation, by\nEaI \u221d \u2212\u000fIJ1 ..JD \u000faa2 ..aD nJ1 E a2 J2 .. E aD JD .\n\n(A.4)\n\nThe condition that \u03c0\u0304 aIJ be tracefree with respect to E becomes\n\u03c0\u0304 aIJ EaI = [\u03c0 aIJ \u2212 2n[I E a|J] ] EaI = \u03c0 aIJ EaI + D nJ = 0.\n\n(A.5)\n\nWe can reformulate this as the condition that \u03c0 aIJ EaI is longitudinal, the coefficient of proportionality then follows from the normalisations. We define the tensor\n\u03baIJ1 ..JD [\u03c0] := \u000fIK1 ..KD \u000fa1 ..aD \u03c0 a1 K1\n\nJ1\n\n.. \u03c0 aD KD\n\nJD ,\n\n(A.6)\n\nwhich is totally symmetric in J1 , .., JD and only depends on \u03c0, not on n. In terms of this tensor\nthe tracefree condition becomes\n\u03c0 aIJ EaI \u221d \u03baI\n\nJ\n\n!\n\nJ2 ..JD\n\nnI nJ2 ..nJD \u221d nJ .\n\n(A.7)\n\nUsing the normalisation condition we can write this as the equality\n\u03baJ1 IJ3 ..JD+1 nJ1 nJ3 .. nJD+1 = \u03b6nI \u03baJ1 ..JD+1 nJ1 .. nJD+1 .\n\n(A.8)\n\nThis is a system of D independent non-polynomial\nequations of order D+2 for the D independent\nq\nPD\nI\nD+1\nunknowns n , I = 1, .., D; n\n= \u00b1 1 \u2212 \u03b6 I=1 (nI )2 . We can turn this into an equivalent\nsystem of D + 1 homogeneous, polynomial equations of order D + 2 by\n\u03baJ1 IJ3 ..JD+1 nJ2 nJ1 .. nJD+1 = nI \u03baJ1 ..JD+1 nJ1 .. nJD+1 ,\n22\n\n(A.9)\n\n\fwhich leaves the normalisation of nI undetermined.\nUp to this point, n was just an extra structure independent of and next to \u03c0. The idea is\nnow to fix nI in terms of \u03c0 by solving the system (A.8). Having determined nI = nI [\u03c0] would\nthen yield the desired tensor E aI [\u03c0] := E aI [\u03c0, n[\u03c0]]. However, it is far from clear whether a\nsolution exists, nor that it is unique, although the number of independent equations matches\nwith the number of degrees of freedom to be fixed. Being polynomial, it is clear that complex\nsolutions of (A.9) exist, but the system of equations is far too complex in order to see whether\nreal solutions exist. Hence to secure at least existence, we must resort to different methods.\nSince the polynomial formulation (A.9) is of no help, we stick with (A.8). We write it in the\nform\nf I (n)\nnI = \u03b6\n, fI (n) = \u03baJ1 I J3 ..JD+1 nJ1 nJ3 .. nJD+1 .\n(A.10)\nnJ f J (n)\nThis equation takes the form of a fixed point equation x = f (x). In order to apply established\ntheorems, (A.10) is not useful because fixed point theorems typically are for compact sets and\nthe right hand side of (A.10) has not manifestly bounded range, especially for signature \u03b6 = \u22121.\nConsider instead the function\nF I (n) := ||n|| [2 \u2212 ||n||]\n\nf I (n)\n.\n||f (n)||\n\n(A.11)\n\nNotice that we use the Euclidean metric in both numerator and denominator also for the case\n\u03b6 = \u22121, i.e. ||n||2 := \u03b4IJ nI nJ . Let us now restrict nI to the compact (closed and bounded) and\nconvex4 (D + 1)-ball\nBD+1 := {n \u2208 RD+1 ; \u03b4IJ nI nJ \u2264 1}.\n(A.12)\nThe map (A.11) is a continuous map from BD+1 to itself. To see this, notice that ||f (n)|| =\n6 0\nexcept at ||n|| = 0. This follows from the identity\nfI (n)nI = NI (n)nI ,\n\n(A.13)\n\nwhich for \u03b6 = 1 and for \u03b6 = \u22121 and n not null shows that ||f || =\n6 0 unless ||n|| = 0. For\n\u03b6 = \u22121 and n null we have in fact fI = \u03b3nI with \u03b3 6= 0. To see this, notice that the span\nof the E aI , a = 1, .., D contains nI . Introduce some basis of the orthogonal complement, say\nbI\u03b1 , \u03b1 = 2, .., D and let bI1 = nI so that \u03b7IJ bI\u03b1 bJ\u03b2 = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 , \u03b1, \u03b2 = 2, .., D and bI1 b\u03b1I = 0. Then\nwe have an expansion E aI = ra\u03b1 bI\u03b1 with det(r) 6= 0 due to linear independence by assumption.\nNext, there exists \u03b3 6= 0 such that\n\u000fIJ1 ..JD bJ\u03b111 ..bJ\u03b1DD = \u03b3nI \u000f\u03b11 ..\u03b1D ,\n\n(A.14)\n\nsince the b\u03b1 are linearly independent and the left hand side of (A.14) is orthogonal to all of\n4\n\nSuppose that ||u||, ||v|| \u2264 1 then\n\n||su + (1 \u2212 s)v||2 = s2 ||u||2 + (1 \u2212 s)2 ||v||2 + 2s(1 \u2212 s) < u, v >\u2264 s2 ||u||2 + (1 \u2212 s)2 ||v||2 + 2s(1 \u2212 s)||u|| ||v|| \u2264 1\nfor any s \u2208 [0, 1] due to the Cauchy Schwarz inequality.\n\n23\n\n\fthem, hence it must be null. We can therefore compute\nfI\n\n= \u03b41\u03b11 bJ\u03b111 \u000fJ1 K1 ..KD \u000fa1 ..aD \u03c0 a1 K1 I E a2 K2 ..E aD KD\nKD\na1 J\na2 \u03b12\n1\n= \u2212\u03b41\u03b11 [\u000fJK1 ..KD bK\n..raD \u03b1D\nIr\n\u03b11 ..b\u03b1D ]\u000fa1 ..aD \u03c0\n\n= \u2212\u03b3\u000f1\u03b12 ..\u03b1D nJ \u000fa1 ..aD \u03c0 a1 J I ra2 \u03b12 ..raD \u03b1D\n= \u03b3\u000f1\u03b12 ..\u03b1D \u000fa1 ..aD EIa1 ra2 \u03b12 ..raD \u03b1D\n= \u03b3\u000f1\u03b12 ..\u03b1D b\u03b2I \u000fa1 ..aD ra1 \u03b2 ra2 \u03b12 ..raD \u03b1D\n= \u03b3\u000f1\u03b12 ..\u03b1D b\u03b2I \u000f\u03b2\u03b12 ..\u03b1D\u22121 det(r)\n= \u03b3[(D \u2212 1)!] det(r)nI .\n\n(A.15)\n\nIt follows that (A.11) is everywhere well defined except possibly at ||n|| = 0 where the\nfraction f (n)/||f (n)|| is ill defined. However, due to the prefactor ||n|| we see that F (n) := 0 at\n||n|| = 0 is a continuous extension. Next\n||F (n)|| = ||n||(2 \u2212 ||n||) = 1 \u2212 [1 \u2212 ||n||]2 \u2208 [0, 1],\n\n(A.16)\n\nhence F maps BD+1 to itself. By the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem [43] applicable to compact\nconvex subsets of Euclidean space, it has a fixed point, that is, the equation nI = F I (n) has\nat least one solution, a fixed point nI = nI\u2217 [\u03c0]. Unfortunately, this is not very helpful because\nn = 0 is a trivial fixed point and the Brouwer fixed point theorem does not tell us anything\nabout the number of fixed points, hence it could be that n = 0 is the only one. However, notice\nthat ||F (n)|| \u2265 ||n|| and ||F (n)|| = ||n|| \u21d4 ||n|| = 1. This suggests that if a fixed point can be\nfound by iteration nk+1 := F (nk ) then it will lie on the sphere S D . Indeed for ||n|| = 1 the map\nF maps S D to itself.\nIn order to see whether a fixed point can be obtained by using iteration methods we estimate\nfor n1 , n2 \u2208 S D\n||F (n1 ) \u2212 F (n2 )||2 = 2[1 \u2212\n=\n\u2264\n\n< f1 , f2 >\n]]\n||f1 || ||f2 ||\n\n1\n[||f1 \u2212 f2 ||2 \u2212 [||f1 || \u2212 ||f2 ||]2 ]\n||f1 || ||f2 ||\n||f1 \u2212 f2 ||2\n.\n||f1 || ||f2 ||\n\n(A.17)\n\nNow\nDIJ := \u2202fI /\u2202nJ = [\u03baJIJ2 ..JD + (D \u2212 1)\u03baIJJ2 ..JD ]nJ2 ..nJD .\n\n(A.18)\n\nIt follows DIJ nJ = DfI . For n2 sufficiently close to n1 , we obtain with the Cauchy Schwarz\ninequality\n||f2 \u2212 f1 ||2 \u2248 ||D(n1 )[n2 \u2212 n1 ]||2 \u2264 Tr(DT (n1 )D(n1 )) ||n2 \u2212 n1 ||2\n(A.19)\nand for ||n|| = 1 again due to the Cauchy Schwarz inequality\nX X\nXX\nTr(DT D) =\n{[ [DIJ ]2 ]||n||2 } \u2265\n[\nDIJ nJ ]2 \u2265 D2 ||f ||2 .\nI\n\nJ\n\nI\n\n(A.20)\n\nJ\n\nThus the right hand side of (A.17) is given by q(n1 , n2 )||n2 \u2212 n1 ||2 , where q(n, n) \u2265 D2 . Hence\nF fails to be a contraction map and we cannot invoke techniques familiar from the Banach\nFixed Point Theorem [43] in order to prove existence of a fixed point as this would need\nsupn1 ,n2 q(n1 , n2 ) < 1. Either sharper bounds are needed or we have to use a different iteration function (recall that fixed point equations can be written in many different but equivalent\n24\n\n\fways and for some of them the iteration map maybe contractible, for others not). Notice that\nas long as we are only interested in obtaining f (n) \u221d n we may rescale f by a sufficiently large\nconstant such that f itself becomes a contraction map and maps BD+1 to itself. This is possible\nbecause f and the matrix defined by f (n2 ) \u2212 f (n1 ) = D(n2 , n1 ) * (n2 \u2212 n1 ) are continuous maps\non the compact sets BD+1 and BD+1 \u00d7 BD+1 respectively and thus are uniformly bounded.\nHowever, due to (A.20) the required constant would turn f into a strictly norm decreasing map\nand thus can only have n = 0 as a fixed point.\n\nRemark:\nIn contrast to D odd, for D even there are two natural vectors that one construct purely from\n\u03c0 namely\n(A.21)\nuI = \u03baIJ1 ..JD \u03b7 J1 J2 ..\u03b7 JD\u22121 JD , vI = \u03baJ1 IJ2 ..JD \u03b7 J1 J2 ..\u03b7 JD\u22121 JD .\nThese are the only independent contractions that exist because \u03baIJ1 ..JD is completely symmetric\nin its J indices. It is natural to assume that the fixed point vector is a linear combination of\nu, v and indeed in D = 2 it is easy to see that n \u221d u. For D \u2265 4 we were not able to verify this\nby direct calculation or any other means due to the complexity of the fixed point equation.\n\n25\n\n\fReferences\n[1] R. Arnowitt, S. Deser, and C. W.
