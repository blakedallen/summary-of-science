The\ndynamical instability is described as a rapid separation\nof two nearby trajectories, the so called Lyapunov vector,\nand causes the loss of memory or unpredictability of the\ndynamical system. The exponential rate of expansion or\ncontraction of the magnitude of the Lyapunov vector is\ncalled the Lyapunov exponent, and its positivity, meaning that the system is chaotic, is a well known indicator of the dynamical instability. Many efforts have been\ndevoted to connect the dynamical instability with statistical properties, like transport coefficients [1, 2]. Some\nworks concentrated on specific effects of the dynamical\ninstability in many-particle systems. Information on the\ndynamical instability in many-particle systems is given\nby the set of Lyapunov exponents (the Lyapunov spectrum) and their associated Lyapunov vectors, and their\nstructures have been of much interest to the study of\nchaotic properties of many-particle systems. The conjugate pairing rule of Lyapunov spectra for thermostated\nsystems [3, 4, 5, 6], localized behaviors for Lyapunov vectors [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], and the thermodynamic limit of\nLyapunov spectra [12, 13, 14, 15] and so on have been\ndiscussed from this point of view.\nThe stepwise structure of Lyapunov spectra is a typical chaotic property of many-particle systems, which was\nfound recently [16]. This stepwise structure appears in\nthe Lyapunov exponents with smallest absolute value,\nand the dynamical structure of these Lyapunov exponents should reflect a slow and global behavior of the\nmacroscopic system. Therefore, clarification of the stepwise structure of Lyapunov spectra (Lyapunov steps) is\nexpected to make a bridge between the macroscopic statistical theory and the microscopic chaotic dynamics. Remarkably, the Lyapunov steps accompany wavelike struc-\n\ntures in the associated Lyapunov vectors, namely the\nLyapunov modes, which offer a useful tool to understand\nthe origin of the stepwise structure of the Lyapunov spectrum [17, 18, 19, 20]. Originally, these structures were\nobserved in many-hard-disk systems, but very recently\nnumerical evidence for the Lyapunov modes was reported\nfor many-particle system with soft-core particle interactions [21]. Some theoretical arguments have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, for example, using\nrandom matrix theory [22, 23], kinetic theory [24, 25, 26],\nand periodic orbit theory [15], etc.\nThe first step to understand the Lyapunov step and\nmode is in the zero Lyapunov exponents and the associated Lyapunov vectors. For instance, the twodimensional system consisting of N particles with periodic boundary conditions has six zero-Lyapunov exponents, and the associated Lyapunov vectors are linear\ncombinations of the six basis vectors N \u22121/2 (1, 0, 0, 0),\nN \u22121/2 (0, 1, 0, 0), N \u22121/2 (0, 0, 1, 0), N \u22121/2 (0, 0, 0, 1),\n|p|\u22121 (px , py , 0, 0), and |p|\u22121 (0, 0, px , py ) where 0 is a\nN -dimensional null vector, 1 is an N -dimensional vector with all x-component equal to 1, and p \u2261 (px , py )\nis the momentum vector with its x-component px and\ny-component py . Here, the first (second) vector is\nassociated with the translational invariance in the xdirection (y-direction), the third (fourth) vector with\nthe conservation of the x-component (y-component) of\nthe total momentum, the fifth vector with the timetranslational invariance (deterministic nature of the orbit), and the last vector with the energy conservation\n[1]. This means that the six sets of the Lyapunov vec(n)\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\ntor components {\u03b4xj }j , {\u03b4yj }j , {\u03b4pxj }j , {\u03b4pyj }j ,\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n{\u03b4xj /pxj , \u03b4yj /pyj }j , and {\u03b4pxj /pxj , \u03b4pyj /pyj }j can\nhave equal components independent of the particle number index j in zero-Lyapunov exponents. Here, we use\nthe notation \u03b4\u0393(n) = (\u03b4q(n) , \u03b4p(n) ) for the Lyapunov\n\n\f2\n\nvector corresponding to Lyapunov exponents \u03bb(n) , and\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\n\u03b4q(n) \u2261 (\u03b4x1 , \u03b4x2 , * * * , \u03b4xN , \u03b4y1 , \u03b4y2 , * * * , \u03b4yN )\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\nand \u03b4p(n) \u2261 (\u03b4px1 , \u03b4px2 , * * * , \u03b4pxN , \u03b4py1 , \u03b4py2 ,\n(n)\n\n* * * , \u03b4pyN ) are the spatial part and the momentum part\nof the Lyapunov vector, respectively.\nAs the next step we regard the degeneracy of the zeroLyapunov exponents and the structure of the corresponding Lyapunov vectors as the zero-th Lyapunov step and\nmode. This scenario was proposed first in Ref. [18], and\nwas also discussed very recently in Ref. [20]. First of\nall, the Lyapunov steps for the two-dimensional system\nwith periodic boundary conditions consist of two-point\nsteps and four-point steps [17, 18], namely the number\nof Lyapunov exponents for one set of Lyapunov steps is\nsix, which is equal to the number of the zero-Lyapunov\nexponents. It is also known that the stepwise structure\nof Lyapunov spectra is changed by violating the spatial\ntranslational invariance and the total momentum conservation, which also change the number of zero-Lyapunov\nexponents [18]. As a second point, some mode structures\nwere observed in some of the above Lyapunov vector components, which should be constant in zero-Lyapunov exponents. For example, a mode structure in the Lyapunov\n(n)\nvector component \u03b4yj (the transverse spatial translational invariance Lyapunov mode) is well known [17].\nThis mode is stationary in time, and appears in one of the\ntwo types of the Lyapunov steps. Ref. [18] showed an(n)\nother mode structure in \u03b4yj /pyj , (the transverse time\ntranslational Lyapunov mode). This mode depends on\ntime, and appears in other types of the Lyapunov steps.\nThese Lyapunov modes are enough to categorize all the\nLyapunov steps. Ref. [17, 19] also claim a moving mode\n(n)\nstructure in \u03b4xj .\nHowever, there has not been enough evidence yet to\nconfirm the above scenario for the Lyapunov steps and\nmodes. For example, the mode structure in the momentum part of Lyapunov vectors has not been reported explicitly. Besides, the phase relations of different modes,\n(n)\n(n)\nfor example, the modes in \u03b4yj /pyj and \u03b4xj , have not\nbeen discussed. Another important problem is the time\nscale specified by a time-dependent Lyapunov mode, like\n(n)\nthe time-oscillation for the mode in \u03b4yj /pyj . The timeoscillating period is usually much longer than the mean\nfree time of the system, and it should correspond to a\ncollective movement, but quantitative evidence for it has\nnot been shown explicitly.\nAs an indicator for collective movements of manyparticle systems, we can use the momentum autocorrelation functions, where collective movement may appear as a time-oscillation behavior [27], as observed in\nmany macroscopic models [28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. The autocorrelation functions are accessible experimentally using\nneutron and light scattering techniques [32, 33, 34, 35].\nAs an essential aspect of auto-correlation functions is\ntheir role as response functions for the system. For example, linear response theory connects the time integral\n\nof the auto-correlation function with a transport coefficient [36]. However it should be emphasized that the\nauto-correlation functions themselves provide much more\ndetailed information about the system. Linear response\ntheory requires the time-integral and the thermodynamic\nlimit of the auto-correlation function to calculate transport coefficients, and in this process information about\nshort time-scales and a finite size effects are lost. For instance, the time-oscillation of the auto-correlation functions is one of the finite size effects, which linear response\ntheory does not treat. Information on short time-scales\nand finite size effects in the auto-correlation functions\nalso plays an important role in the generalized hydrodynamics [37] and generalized Fokker-Planck equation [38].\nThe purposes of this paper are two-fold. First we calculate all components of the Lyapunov vectors associated\nwith the stepwise structure of the Lyapunov spectrum.\nThey include the longitudinal and transverse components\nof both the spatial and momentum parts of the Lyapunov\nvectors. We demonstrate the wavelike structures in the\ncomponents of the Lyapunov vectors, and specify their\nphase relations. These results support the above explanation for the origin of the Lyapunov steps and modes\nbased on the zero-Lyapunov exponents and the associated Lyapunov vectors. Spatial node structures of these\nLyapunov modes are explained in terms of boundary conditions. It is emphasized that some of the Lyapunov\nmodes show time-oscillating behaviors, and a particle\nnumber dependence in their time-oscillating periods. The\nsecond purpose of this paper is to discuss the connection\nbetween the time-oscillation of the Lyapunov modes and\nthe momentum auto-correlation functions. Our central\nresult is that the longest time-oscillating period of the\nLyapunov modes is twice as long as that for the autocorrelation function for the longitudinal component of\nthe momentum. This relation is satisfied irrespective of\nthe number of particles in the system and the boundary conditions. We give a simple explanation for this\nrelation. This result means that the time-oscillating behavior of the Lyapunov vectors is reflected by a collective movement within many-particle systems. This also\ngives some evidence to connect the Lyapunov mode, a\ntangent space property specified by Lyapunov vectors,\nto the auto-correlation function, which is a phase space\nproperty and is accessible experimentally.\nWe use a quasi-one-dimensional many-hard-disk system, as this model allows fast numerical calculation of\nthe Lyapunov exponents and vectors, and shows clear\nLyapunov steps and modes. In general the numerical calculation of the Lyapunov spectrum and vectors are very\ntime-consuming, and it is often difficult to get clear Lyapunov mode structures, particularly for time-dependent\nLyapunov modes. If the above picture of the Lyapunov\nsteps and modes based on universal properties such as\nthe translational invariances and the conservation laws\ncan be justified, then a simple model should be sufficient to convince us of their origin. This system also\nexhibits a clear oscillatory behavior in the longitudinal\n\n\f3\n\nmomentum auto-correlation function. A useful technique\nto get clear Lyapunov steps and modes is to use hardwall boundary conditions. Although hard-wall boundary conditions destroy the spatial translational invariance and the total momentum conservation, and lead to\ndifferent structure in the Lyapunov spectrum compared\nto periodic boundary conditions, it has been shown that\nthere is a simple relation between the observed Lyapunov\nsteps and modes and different boundary conditions [18].\nSpecifically, we use a quasi-one-dimensional system with\nhard-wall boundary conditions in the longitudinal direction and periodic boundary conditions in the transverse\ndirection. Usually, the hard-wall boundary conditions\nmake numerical calculation slower compared to periodic\nboundary conditions, but in our system only the two particles at each end of the system collide with the hard-walls\nso the effect is small.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II, the\nquasi-one-dimensional system is introduced. In Sec. III\nwe discuss the Lyapunov steps and modes. In Sec. IV the\nmomentum auto-correlation functions and their relation\nwith the Lyapunov modes is discussed . Finally we give\nsome conclusion and remarks in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nQUASI-ONE-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEM\n\nThe model considered in this paper is a quasione-dimensional many-hard-disk system. It is a twodimensional rectangular system consisting of many harddisks with the width of the system so narrow that the\ndisk positions are not exchanged, thus the disks can be\nnumbered from left to right. We assume that the mass\nm and the radius R of each disk is the same. In this case\nthe quasi-one-dimensional system has a width Ly that\nsatisfies the condition 2R < Ly < 4R. Figure 1 gives a\nschematic illustration of the quasi-one-dimensional system with the particles numbered 1, 2, * * * , N (N : particle\nnumber) from the left to right.\n\nFIG. 1: A schematic illustration of a quasi-one-dimensional\nsystem used in this paper. The system shape is so narrow\nthat particles always remain in the same order. Here, Lx\n(Ly ) is the length (width) of the system in the longitudinal\n(transverse) direction, and R is the radius of a particle. The\ndashed lines represent periodic boundary conditions and the\nsolid lines represent hard-wall boundary conditions. The particles are numbered 1, 2, * * * , N from the left to the right.\n\nOriginally, the quasi-one-dimensional many-hard-disk\nsystem was introduced as a system to easily and clearly\nobserve the stepwise structure of Lyapunov spectrum\n(which we call the \"Lyapunov steps\") and the corresponding wave-like structure of Lyapunov vectors (the so\ncalled \"Lyapunov modes\") [18]. Numerical observation of\n\nthe Lyapunov steps and modes is very time-consuming,\nand even at present the Lyapunov spectra is limited to\nabout 1000 particles [17]. Therefore it is valuable to explore fast and effective ways to calculate them numerically. It is well known that the rectangular system has a\nwider stepwise region than a square system with the same\narea and number of particles. This quasi-one-dimensional\nsystem is the most rectangular two-dimensional system\npossible. Ref. [18] demonstrated that in the quasi-onedimensional system we can clearly observe the structure\nof the Lyapunov modes. It is known that there are two\nkinds of Lyapunov modes: stationary modes and timedependent modes. The stational Lyapunov modes are\nmost easily observed because of their stable structure,\nbut generally the observation of the time-dependent Lyapunov modes is much harder because of large fluctuations\nin their structure and their intrinsic time-dependence.\nThe quasi-one-dimensional system is the first system\nin which time-oscillating Lyapunov modes were demonstrated [18].\nAnother advantage of the quasi-one-dimensional system is that the particle interactions in this system are\nrestricted to nearest-neighbor particles only, so we need\nmuch less effort to find colliding particle pairs numerically compared with the fully two-dimensional system in\nwhich each particle can collide with any other particle.\nThis leads to faster numerical calculation of the system\ndynamics. Besides, in this system, particle movement\nin the narrow direction is suppressed, compared to the\nlongitudinal direction, and roughly speaking the particle\nsequence corresponds to the particle position. This leads\nto a much simpler representation of Lyapunov modes,\nwhich must be investigated as functions of spatial coordinates and time. One may also notice that in the\nquasi-one-dimensional system the system size is proportional to the particle number\u221a N , while for the square\nsystem it is proportional to N . This implies that in\nthe quasi-one-dimensional system, many-particle effects\nmore evident than for the fully two-dimensional systems\nwith the same number of particles.\nAnother important point in the quasi-one-dimensional\nsystem is the effect of boundary conditions. Different\nfrom the square system, in which the boundary length\nis proportional to the square root of the system size, in\nthe quasi-one-dimensional system the boundary length is\nproportional to the system size itself, therefore we cannot neglect its effect even in the thermodynamic limit.\nActually Ref. [18] showed that the Lyapunov steps and\nmodes depend strongly on boundary conditions. Boundary conditions change, not only the structure of Lyapunov steps and modes, but also the clearness of Lyapunov mode structure. For example, a system with\npurely hard-wall boundary conditions has no stationary\nLyapunov mode and its corresponding Lyapunov steps\nand show much clearer time-oscillating Lyapunov modes,\ncompared to a system with the periodic boundary conditions. Roughly speaking, hard-wall boundary conditions pin the positions of the nodes and thus lead to\n\n\f4\n\nclearer Lyapunov modes. On the other hand, the numerical calculation with the hard-wall boundary conditions is\nmore time-consuming. This disadvantage is significant in\nthe quasi-one-dimensional system with purely hard-wall\nboundary conditions. As another disadvantage of the\nsystem with purely hard-wall boundary conditions, we\ncannot investigate the stationary Lyapunov mode due to\nspatial translational invariance. As an optimal system\nwe mostly consider a quasi-one-dimensional system with\nhard-wall boundary conditions in the longitudinal direction and periodic boundary conditions in the transverse\ndirection. We use the notation (H,P) for this boundary\ncondition throughout this paper. In Fig. 1 we represent\nthe boundary condition (H,P) as different types of lines\non the boundaries: the bold solid lines signify hard-wall\nboundary conditions and the broken lines signify periodic\nboundary conditions. In this system we can get much\nclearer Lyapunov modes than for purely periodic boundary conditions and we observe both types of Lyapunov\nsteps and modes.\nAlthough the quasi-one-dimensional many-hard-disk\nsystem with the boundary condition (H,P) may be artificially introduced to investigate Lyapunov steps and\nmodes in a fast and effective way, it is essential to note\nthat the results from this system can be used to predict Lyapunov steps and modes in more general systems,\nsuch as a fully two-dimensional system with purely periodic boundary conditions. Details of the relation of the\nLyapunov steps and modes in quasi-one-dimensional systems with different boundary conditions were given in\nRef. [18]. For example, the step widths of the Lyapunov\nspectrum (the spatial and time periods of the corresponding Lyapunov modes) in the system with the boundary\ncondition (H,P) are halves (twice) the ones in the system with the purely periodic boundary conditions (P,P).\nIt is also known that the structure of Lyapunov steps for\nthe quasi-one-dimensional system is the same as the fully\ntwo-dimensional system.\nAs we discussed above, the main reason to use the\nquasi-one-dimensional system with the boundary condition (H,P) is to get clear Lyapunov steps and modes in a\nfast numerical calculation. On the other hand, these advantages may not assist the calculation of the momentum\nauto-correlation function. In the quasi-one-dimensional\nsystem, collisions of a particle are restricted to its two\nnearest-neighbor particles only, so it may be supposed\nthat specific types of collisions like the \"back scattering\neffect\" play an important role in this system. The back\nscattering effect, which comes from a reversal of the velocity of a particle by a collision with the nearest neighbor\nparticle, can lead to a negative region of the momentum\nauto-correlation function. One may also suppose that\nin the quasi-one-dimensional system a collective motion\nmay be enhanced, because the movement of particles in\nthe narrow direction is very restricted. This may lead to a\nclear time-oscillation of the momentum auto-correlation\nfunction, as will be actually observed in Sect. IV of\nthis paper. It may also be noted that boundary condi-\n\ntion effects on the momentum auto-correlation function\nare not well known. Because we need to know about\nthem to be able to guess the relation between the autocorrelation functions and Lyapunov modes in different\nboundary conditions, we will discuss boundary condition\neffects on momentum auto-correlation function briefly in\nSect. IV C.\nIn this paper we use units where the mass m and the\nparticle radius R are 1, and the total energy E is N\n(except in Sec. III D). For the numerical calculations,\nthe system lengths are chosen as Lx = 1.5N Ly + 2R and\nLy = 2R(1 + 10\u22126) for the quasi-one-dimensional system\nwith the boundary condition (H,P).\n\nIII.\n\nLYAPUNOV STEPS AND MODES\n\nIn this section we discuss the Lyapunov steps and\nmodes in the quasi-one-dimensional system with boundary condition (H,P). Part of these results have already\nbeen presented in Ref. [18], and here we complete this\npresentation. Some of the discussions omitted in Ref.\n[18] were the relation between the time-oscillating Lyapunov mode proportional to the momentum and the longitudinal Lyapunov modes, the Lyapunov modes for the\nmomentum parts of Lyapunov vectors, and the particle\nnumber dependence of the time-oscillating period of the\nLyapunov modes.\nWe introduce the Lyapunov spectrum as the ordered\nset of the Lyapunov exponents \u03bb(n) , n = 1, 2, * * * , 4N ,\n(n)\nwhere \u03bb(1) \u2265 \u03bb(2) \u2265 * * * \u2265 \u03bb(4N ) . The notations \u03b4qj \u2261\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n(\u03b4xj , \u03b4yj ) and \u03b4pj \u2261 (\u03b4pxj , \u03b4pyj ) are used for the\nspatial and momentum components, respectively, of the\nj-th particle Lyapunov vector corresponding to the n-th\nLyapunov exponent \u03bb(n) .\nFor a numerical calculation of the Lyapunov spectrum\nand the Lyapunov vectors, we used the numerical algorithm developed by Benettin et al. [39] and Shimada\net al. [40] (Also See Refs. [41, 42]). This algorithm is\ncharacterized by regular re-orthogonalizations and renormalization of set of Lyapunov vectors, which can be done\nafter each particle collision in a many-hard-disk system.\nUsually the Lyapunov steps and modes appear after a\nlong trajectory calculation, and we typically calculated\ntrajectories of more than 5 \u00d7 105 particle collisions to get\nthe Lyapunov spectra and vectors shown here.\nThe main purpose in this section is to investigate the\ntime-oscillating structures in the transverse and longitudinal Lyapunov modes. As we mentioned in Sect. II the\nnumerical calculation of Lyapunov spectra and Lyapunov\nvectors for many-particle systems is time-consuming even\nin the quasi-one-dimensional system, and in this paper we present results of 100 particle systems. In such\na rather small system the structure of the Lyapunov\nmodes has large fluctuations in space and time, which\nprevents the appearance of clear mode structures. Another problem appears in the investigation of the Lya-\n\n\f5\n\npunov modes proportional to the momentum. We investigate these modes by calculating such the quantities\n(n)\n\u03b4xj /pxj , which should show a time-oscillating wave-like\nstructure, if the Lyapunov vector components has modes\nproportional to momentum. However, fluctuations of this\nquantity may be enhanced in cases where the momentum component has a small absolute value. To overcome\nthese technical problems, and to visualize this structure\nas clearly as possible, we take a local time-average of the\nLyapunov modes. More concretely, for investigations of\n(n)\nthe modes of the Lyapunov vector components \u03b4xj and\n(n)\n\n\u03b4yj we take their arithmetic average over 8N collisions\nusing data just after collisions, and plot them as functions of the same local time arithmetic average of xj and\nthe first collision number of time interval taking the lo(n)\ncal time average. For modes in the quantities \u03b4xj /pxj\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n\u03b4yj /pyj , \u03b4pyj /pxj , and \u03b4pyj /pyj we take the same local time average, except that if the absolute value |pxj |\n(|pyj |) of the momentum componentp\nis less than 10% of\nthe averaged momentum amplitude 2M E/N then we\nexclude the data at that time from the local time average.\nWe use the notation h* * * it for such a local time average\nin this paper.\nA.\n\nLyapunov steps\n\nFigure 2 is the stepwise structure of the Lyapunov\nspectrum normalized by the largest Lyapunov exponent\nfor the quasi-one-dimensional many-hard-disk system of\n100 particles with (H,P) boundary condition. The entire\npositive branch of the Lyapunov spectrum is shown in the\ninset to this figure. In a Hamiltonian system, the negative branch of the Lyapunov spectrum takes the same\nabsolute value as the positive branch of the Lyapunov\nspectrum from the conjugate pairing rule: \u03bb(4N \u2212n+1) =\n\u2212\u03bb(n) , n = 1, 2, * * * , 2N [43], so they are omitted in Fig.\n2.\n\nFIG. 2: Stepwise structure of the Lyapunov spectrum normalized by the largest Lyapunov exponent for the quasi-onedimensional system with hard-wall boundary conditions in\nx-direction and periodic boundary conditions in y-direction.\nThe particle number is N = 100. The white-filled (blackfilled) circles correspond to the stational (time-oscillating)\nLyapunov modes. Inset: The full spectrum of the positive\nbranch of the normalized Lyapunov spectrum.\n\nThis system has 4 zero-Lyapunov exponents, which\ncome from the conservation of the y-component of the\ntotal momentum and the center of mass, energy conservation, and the deterministic nature of the orbit. Note\nthat the x-component of the total momentum and the\ncenter of mass are not conserved, because of the hard-\n\nwall boundary condition in the x-direction. Half of these\n4 zero-Lyapunov exponents appear in Fig. 2.\nThe stepwise structure of the Lyapunov spectrum in\nthis system is one and two-point steps. These two kinds\nof Lyapunov steps accompany different mode structures\nin the Lyapunov vectors: one is the stationary modes,\nas discussed in subsections III B, and the other is timeoscillating modes, as discussed in the subsection III C.\nHere we count the sequence of Lyapunov steps from the\nzero Lyapunov exponents, so \u03bb(200) and \u03bb(199) are the\nzero exponents, \u03bb(198) is the first one-point step, \u03bb(197)\nand \u03bb(196) are the first two-point step, \u03bb(195) is the second\none-point step, and \u03bb(194) and \u03bb(193) are the second twopoint step, see Fig. 2.\n\nB.\n\nStationary Lyapunov modes\n\nFirst we discuss the Lyapunov mode corresponding to\nthe first and second one-point steps in Fig. 2. Fig. 3\nshows the graph of the Lyapunov vector components corresponding to the first and second one-point step as a\nfunction of the collision number nt and the normalized\nlocal time average hxj it /Lx of the x-component of the\nparticle position. Here, Fig. 3(a) is for the local time(198)\n(198)\nit for the first one-point\nit and h\u03b4yj\naverages of h\u03b4xj\nstep \u03bb(198) , and Fig. 3(b) is a similar graph for the second one-point step \u03bb(195) . These one-point steps are indicated by arrows in Fig. 2. Both graphs have the same\ncollision number interval [524000, 569600]. On the base\nof each of Figs. 3(a) and (b) we give contour-plots of the\n(195)\n(198)\nit , respectively,\nit and h\u03b4yj\ntransversal modes h\u03b4yj\nin which the dotted lines, the solid lines, and the broken lines correspond to the levels -0.08, 0, and +0.08,\nrespectively.\n\nFIG. 3: Local time averages of h\u03b4xj it and h\u03b4yj it for the\nfirst two-point step (exponent 198) in (a), and for the second\ntwo-point step (exponent 195) in (b). These are shown as\nfunctions of the collision number nt and the normalized local\ntime average hxj it /Lx of the x-component of the j-th particles position (with the system length Lx ). The corresponding\nLyapunov exponents \u03bb(198) and \u03bb(195) are indicated by arrows\nin Fig. 2. The base of each graph are the contour plots of\nthe transverse Lyapunov modes at the levels \u22120.08 (broken\nlines), 0 (solid lines), and +0.08 (dotted lines).\n\nIn Fig. 3 we recognize spatial wave-like structures in\n(n)\nthe transverse components of h\u03b4yj it for n = 198 and\n195 which are stationary in time (at least in a time interval of more than 45 \u00d7 103 collisions as shown in this figure). These wave-like structures are very nicely fitted by\nsinusoidal functions [18]. Note that in the calculation of\nLyapunov vectors we used the numerical algorithm which\n\n\f6\n\nimposed renormalization of the Lyapunov vectors at every collision, so that the amplitudes of any component of\nthe Lyapunov vector must be less than 1. It should be\nemphasized that anti-nodes in the modes appear at the\nend of the system in the x-direction. By comparison the\n(n)\namplitudes of the longitudinal components of h\u03b4xj it for\nn = 198 and 195 are extremely small. These observations\nsuggest that the Lyapunov mode corresponding to the kth one-point Lyapunov step is approximately represented\nby\n(\u03bc(k))\n\n\u03b4xj\n\n(\u03bc(k))\n\n\u03b4yj\n\n\u2248 0,\n\u2248 \u03b1k cos\n\n(1)\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0k\nxj\nLx\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nj = 1, 2, * * * , N , corresponding to the Lyapunov exponents \u03bb(\u03bc(k)) , in which \u03b1k is a constant and \u03bc(k) is the\nLyapunov index corresponding to the k-th one-point step\nof the Lyapunov spectrum. Here we take the origin of the\nx-component of the spatial coordinate to be xj = 0, so\nthat an ambiguity in spatial phase can be removed in Eq.\n(2).\n\nhand, in Fig. 4(d), the transverse Lyapunov vector com(197)\n/pyj it has anti-nodes at the end of the\nponent h\u03b4yj\nsystem and has a node at the middle, although its wavelength is given by 2Lx as for the longitudinal mode of\nFig. 4(a).\nThere is also a time-oscillating wave-like structure in the longitudinal Lyapunov vector component\n(197)\n/pxj it , as shown in Fig. 4(b). This structure\nh\u03b4xj\nis different from the one shown in Fig. 4(a) associated\nwith the same longitudinal Lyapunov vector component\n(197)\n. It has anti-nodes at the ends of the system, and\n\u03b4xj\nhas a node in the middle. Its wave-length is 2Lx. These\ncharacteristics suggest that although there are large fluctuations in the middle of the system, the time-oscillating\nwave-like structure in Fig. 4(b) is the same as that in Fig.\n4(d). In Fig. 4(c) it is rather difficult to recognize any\nstructure. Roughly speaking, it is just random fluctuations, in middle of the system but the amplitude of such\nfluctuations is small compared to region at the end of the\nsystem. However such small amplitude fluctuations are\nrequired for consistency with Fig. 4(d), namely the fact\n(197)\n/pyj is small, so\nthat in this region the value of \u03b4yj\n(197)\n\nC.\n\nTime-oscillating Lyapunov modes\n\nNow we discuss the remaining Lyapunov modes, which\ncorrespond to the two-point steps of the Lyapunov spectrum. Figure 4 shows the graphs of the local time\n(197)\n(197)\n(197)\nit , and\n/pxj it , h\u03b4yj\nit , h\u03b4xj\naverages of h\u03b4xj\n(197)\n\n/pyj it as functions of the collision number nt and\nh\u03b4yj\nnormalized local time averaged position hxj it /Lx of the\nj-th particle. The number of particles is N = 100, and\nthe four graphs are for the same collision number interval\nnt \u2208 [535200, 569600]. These correspond to the first exponent on the first two-point step, exponent 197, in Fig.\n2. In these figures, we draw a contour plot on the base\nof each three dimensional graph at levels \u22120.08 (dotted\nlines), 0 (solid lines), and +0.08 (broken lines).\n\nFIG. 4: Local time averages of h\u03b4xj it , h\u03b4xj /pxj it , h\u03b4yj it , and\nh\u03b4yj /pyj it for the Lyapunov modes corresponding to the first\nexponent of the first two-point step (\u03bb(197) ), as functions of\nthe collision number nt and the normalized local time average hxj it /Lx of the x-component of the position of the j-th\nparticle. The base of each graph is a contour plot of the three\ndimensional graph at the levels \u22120.08 (dotted lines), 0 (solid\nlines), and +0.08 (broken lines).\n\nWe can easily recognize spatial wave-like structures\nwith time-oscillations in Figs. 4(a) and (d). In Fig. 4(a),\n(197)\nit\nthe longitudinal Lyapunov vector component h\u03b4xj\nhas nodes at the ends of the quasi-one-dimensional system, and the wave-length is given by 2Lx . On the other\n\nitself should be small with an almost\nthe value of \u03b4yj\nposition independent momentum pyj .\nNext we discuss the phase relations for the Lyapunov\nmodes of the first two-point steps, corresponding to exponents \u03bb(196) and \u03bb(197) (the black-filled circles with\nbrace underneath in Fig. 2). Figure 5 shows the contour plots of the local time averages of h\u03b4xj it , h\u03b4xj /pxj it ,\nh\u03b4yj /pyj it , and for \u03bb(196) and \u03bb(197) as functions of the\ncollision number nt and the normalized local time average hxj it /Lx of the position of the j-th particle at levels\n\u22120.08, 0, and +0.08, for a 100-particle system. The six\ngraphs in Fig. 5 have the same collision number interval\n[535200, 569600], and Figs. 5(a), (c), and (e) correspond\nto Figs. 4(a), (b), and (d), respectively.\n\nFIG. 5: Contour plots of the local time averages of h\u03b4xj it ,\nh\u03b4xj /pxj it , h\u03b4yj /pyj it , for the first two-point steps (\u03bb(197)\n(a,c,e) and \u03bb(196) (b,d,f)), as functions of the collision number nt and the normalized local time average hxj it /Lx of the\nposition of the j-th particle in the same collision number interval [535200, 569600]. The dotted lines, the solid lines, and\nthe broken lines are contour lines at the levels \u22120.08, 0, and\n+0.08, respectively.\n\nFigure 5 shows that the two Lyapunov exponents for\nthe same two-point step have the same structure of Lyapunov modes, but they are orthogonal in time, namely\nnode lines of the Lyapunov modes corresponding to the\nLyapunov exponent \u03bb(197) correspond to anti-node lines\nof the ones of \u03bb(196) . We also notice that the node lines of\n(n)\n(n)\nthe Lyapunov modes in h\u03b4xj /pxj it and h\u03b4yj /pyj it coincide with each other in space and time (n = 197, 196),\n\n\f7\n\n(n)\n\npoint steps of the Lyapunov spectrum) lead to the conjecture that the spatial part of Lyapunov vector compo(\u03bd(k)\u22121)\n(\u03bd(k))\ncorresponding to the Lyaand \u03b4yj\nnents \u03b4xj\npunov exponents constructing the k-th two-point step are\napproximately expressed as\n\non the other hand the Lyapunov modes in h\u03b4xj it and\n\n(n)\nh\u03b4xj /pxj it\n\nare orthogonal in space and time at the same\nLyapunov index.\nThe above discussions based on Figs. 4 and 5 (and\nsimilar observations of Lyapunov modes in the other two-\n\n(\u03bd(k))\n\n\u03b4xj\n\n(\u03bd(k)\u22121)\n\n\u03b4xj\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c0k\n2\u03c0k\n2\u03c0k\n\u03c0k\nxj cos\nnt +\u03b2k\u2032 + \u03b1\u0303\u2032k sin\nxj sin\nnt +\u03b2k\u2032\nLx\nTlya\nLx\nTlya\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u03c0k\n2\u03c0k\n2\u03c0k\n\u03c0k\nxj sin\nnt +\u03b2k\u2032 + \u03b1\u0303\u2032\u2032k sin\nxj cos\nnt +\u03b2k\u2032\n\u2248 \u03b1\u2032\u2032k pxj cos\nLx\nTlya\nLx\nTlya\n\n\u2248 \u03b1\u2032k pxj cos\n\n(\u03bd(k))\n\n\u03b4yj\n\n(\u03bd(k)\u22121)\n\n\u03b4yj\n\nj = 1, 2, * * * , N with constants \u03b1\u2032k , \u03b1\u2032\u2032k , \u03b1\u0303\u2032k , \u03b1\u0303\u2032\u2032k and \u03b2k\u2032 . It\nshould be noted that large fluctuations in the Lyapunov\nmode represented in middle of Figs 4(b), 5(c), and 5(d)\ncan come from the second terms on the right-hand sides\nof Eqs. (3) and (4). On the other hand the effect of the\nfirst terms on the right-hand side of Eqs. (3) and (4)\ndoes not appear explicitly in Figs 4(a), 5(a) and 5(b),\nbecause the factor pxj in these terms distributes their\ncontributions randomly and these terms disappear after\ntaking local time averages.\nD.\n\nEnergy dependence of Lyapunov mode\namplitudes\n\nIn the expressions (3), (4), (5) and (6) for the timeoscillating Lyapunov modes, the quantities \u03b1\u2032k , \u03b1\u2032\u2032k , \u03b1\u0303\u2032k\nand \u03b1\u0303\u2032\u2032k are introduced simply as coefficients of the linear combination of the longitudinal spatial translational\ninvariance Lyapunov mode and the time translational\ninvariance Lyapunov mode. However it is important\nto note that these coefficients are related to each other\nthrough the normalization of the Lyapunov mode.\nWe consider the condition that the Lyapunov\n(\u03bd \u2032 )\n(\u03bd \u2032 )\n(\u03bd \u2032 )\n(\u03bd \u2032 )\n(\u03bd \u2032 )\nmode vector (\u03b4x1 , \u03b4x2 , * * * , \u03b4xN , \u03b4y1 , \u03b4y2 ,\n(\u03bd \u2032 )\n* * * , \u03b4yN ), \u03bd \u2032 = \u03bd(k), \u03bd(k) \u2212 1 is normalizable.

(3) and (5) coincide.\nIt may be noted that the normalization procedure in\nthe Benettin's algorithm, which we used to calculate the\nLyapunov exponents and vectors in this paper, requires\nthe normalization of Lyapunov vectors including both\ntheir spatial part and momentum part, but in the above\nargument we assumed the normalizability of the spatial\npart only of the Lyapunov vectors. This can be justified\nby the fact that as shown in Sec. III F the spatial part\nand momentum part of Lyapunov vectors constructing\nLyapunov modes show almost the same mode structure,\nso each of them should be independently normalizable.\n\nE.\n\nSpatial node structures of the Lyapunov modes\nand reflections in the hard-walls\n\nThe spatial node structure of the Lyapunov modes can\nbe explained using the collision rule for particles with\nhard-walls.\nFor (H,P) boundary condition the particle collisions\nwith the hard-walls in the x-direction cause a change\nin the sign of the x-component of the momentum with\nthe remaining components of the phase space vector unchanged:\nxj\nyj\npxj\npyj\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\nxj ,\nyj ,\n\u2212pxj ,\npyj .\n\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n\nSimilarly, in this type of collision the x-components of the\nLyapunov vector change their signs while the remaining\ncomponents unchanged:\n\nresults explain the spatial node structures shown in Fig.\n5. The spatial node structure of the stationary Lyapunov\nmodes in \u03b4yj corresponding to the one-point steps can be\nexplained in this way. Because \u03b4yj varies sinusoidally and\nmust satisfy the reflection symmetry, it must be either a\nnode (if the sign changes) or an anti-node (if the sign is\ninvariant). Hence, in this case the Lyapunov mode in \u03b4yj\nshould have an anti-node at the hard-walls.\n\nF.\n\nLyapunov modes in momentum components of\nLyapunov vectors\n\nSo far, we have discussed only the spatial components\nof the Lyapunov vectors. In this subsection we discuss\nbriefly the Lyapunov modes appearing in the momentum\nparts of Lyapunov vectors.\nOne of the few differences between spatial and momentum components of Lyapunov vectors is that the amplitudes of the momentum components are often much\nsmaller than those of the corresponding spatial components [11]. This makes Lyapunov modes for the momentum parts of the Lyapunov vectors less clear than the corresponding spatial components. However, basically the\nstructure of the Lyapunov mode for the momentum part\nof the Lyapunov vector is quite similar to the corresponding spatial component. For this reason, in this subsection we omit a detailed discussion of the phase relations\nof multiple Lyapunov modes for the momentum parts of\nLyapunov vectors, and just show that there are certain\nmodes structures in the momentum components of Lyapunov vectors corresponding to the Lyapunov steps.\n\n(n)\n\n\u03b4xj\n\u03b4yj\n\u03b4pxj\n\u03b4pyj\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\n\u2212\u03b4xj ,\n\u03b4yj ,\n\u2212\u03b4pxj ,\n\u03b4pyj .\n\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n(17)\n\nNote that in the x components of Lyapunov vector \u03b4xj\nchanges its sign as well as \u03b4pxj , which is different from\nthe phase space vector.\nThe important point is that a system with hard-wall\nboundaries is equivalent to an infinite system generated\nby reflecting the positions and velocities of all particles\n(in the hard wall) and by changing the signs of all xcomponents of the Lyapunov vectors at the hard-wall.\nThat is explicitly incorporating the reflection symmetries\nfor the phase space vector and the Lyapunov vector at\nhard walls. If the modes of the entire system are connected smoothly sinusoidal functions at the hard walls,\nthen this condition requires that the mode for the quantity \u03b4xj has a node at a hard wall, because it changes\nsign there. On the other hand, the quantities \u03b4xj /pxj\nand \u03b4yj /pyj do not change their signs at hard walls, so\nthese modes should have anti-nodes at hard walls. These\n\nFIG. 7: Global time averages h\u03b4pyj i for the Lyapunov exponents corresponding to the first, second and third one-point\nstep of the Lyapunov spectrum [n = 198 (circles),195 (triangles) and 192 (squares)] as functions of the normalized global\ntime average hxj i/Lx of the position of the j-th.\n\n(n)\n\nFigure 7 shows mode structure of \u03b4pyj corresponding\nto the first three one-point steps (n = 198,195 and 192) as\nfunctions of the normalized particle positions. This structure is stationary in time, so we took their global time\naverage over 200N collisions, using the notation h* * * i for\nthis global time-average without the suffix t. These mode\nstructures are stationary in time, and are similar to the\n(n)\nones for the corresponding spatial part \u03b4yj discussed in\nSect.

The N dependence of \u03c4 is nicely fitted to the function\ny = \u03b3/x with the value \u03b3 \u2248 1.91 of the fitting parameter\n\u03b3. Noting that the period, in real time, is given by \u03c4 Tlya\napproximately, these results suggest that the period of\nthe Lyapunov modes is proportional to the number of\nparticles N , namely the system size.\n\n(n)\n\nIn Sect.

As shown in\nthe proceeding subsection III C, the Lyapunov modes re(n)\n(n)\nlated to the quantity h\u03b4xj it (the quantities h\u03b4xj /pxj it\n\nFIG. 10: The quantity Lx /(\u03c4 T\u0304acf ) as a function of the number of particles N .

Using this prop(n)\nerties we took 6 data points for the quantity h\u03b4xj it (the\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nquantities h\u03b4xj /pxj it and h\u03b4yj /pyj it ) (n = 2N \u2212 3) in\nthe middle (at the end) of the system with (H,P) boundary condition. These data are fitted to a sinusoidal function y = a sin{(2\u03c0x/Tlya ) + b} with fitting parameters\na, b, and Tlya , which leads to a numerical estimation of\nthe period Tlya of the time-oscillation of the Lyapunov\nmodes. The collision number interval Tlya can be translated into a real time interval by multiplying by the mean\nfree time \u03c4 , if necessary.\nFigure 9 is the graph of the period Tlya of the\n(197)\n(197)\n/pxj it (triit (circles), h\u03b4xj\ntime-oscillations of h\u03b4xj\n(197)\n\n/pyj it (squares) in the quasi-oneangles), and h\u03b4yj\ndimensional system with (H,P) boundary condition, as\nfunctions of the number of particles N . Spatial and\ntemporal behavior of these quantities has already been\n\nNow, we investigate the time-oscillating period of the\nLyapunov modes in a different way. Figure 10 shows\nthe quantity Lx /(\u03c4 T\u0304acf ) using the system length Lx ,\nthe mean free time \u03c4 and the averaged time-oscillating\n(2N \u22123)\nit ,\nperiods \u03c4 T\u0304acf of the Lyapunov modes in h\u03b4xj\n(2N \u22123)\n\n(2N \u22123)\n\n/pyj it in the first two/pxj it , and h\u03b4yj\nh\u03b4xj\npoint step of the Lyapunov spectrum. This figure suggests that this quantity is almost 1 independent of the\nparticle\np number N , therefore equal to the thermal velocity E/(M N ).\nIV.\n\nAUTO-CORRELATION FUNCTIONS\n\nIn this section we discuss another property of the quasione-dimensional system, namely the time-oscillation behavior of the momentum auto-correlation function. This\nis a typical measure of the collective behavior of manyparticle systems. We connect this behavior with the\n\n\f10\n\ntime-oscillating behavior of the Lyapunov modes, suggesting that the time-oscillation of the Lyapunov modes\ncan also be regarded as a collective mode.\nWe calculate numerically the auto-correlation functions C\u03b7 (t) for the \u03b7-component of the momentum based\non the normalized expression C\u03b7 (t) \u2261 C\u0303\u03b7 (t)/C\u0303\u03b7 (0), in\nwhich C\u0303\u03b7 (t) is defined by\n1\nC\u0303\u03b7 (t) \u2261 lim\nT \u2192+\u221e (N2 \u2212 N1 + 1)T\nN2 Z T\nX\n\u00d7\nds p\u03b7j (s + t)p\u03b7j (s),\nj=N1\n\n(18)\n\n0\n\n\u03b7 = x or y. Eq. (18) includes a time-average and an\naverage over some of particles (from the N1 -th particle\nto the N2 -th particle) in the middle of the system. (Note\nthat number the particles 1, 2, * * * , N from left to right\nin the system, as shown in Fig. 1.) In actual calculations\nwe choose N1 = [(N + 1)/2] \u2212 5 and N2 = [(N + 1)/2] + 5\nwith [x] as the integer part of the real number x. This\nmeans that we take into account only 11 particles in\nthe middle of the system in the calculation of the autocorrelation function C\u03b7 (t). (In this paper we consider\nthe case N \u2265 40 > 11.) It should be noted that using (H,P) boundary condition the auto-correlation function for particles near hard-walls are different from the\nones for particles in the middle of the system, as discussed in Appendix A. Especially, the momentum autocorrelation function of particles near hard-walls do not\nshow clear time-oscillating behavior. To get the clearest\ntime-oscillating behavior for the auto-correlation function C\u03b7 (t) and to get less hard-wall boundary condition\neffects, we exclude the auto-correlation functions of particles near hard-walls in the calculation of C\u03b7 (t).\nIf the system is ergodic, the value of the autocorrelation function (18) will be independent of the initial condition. To get the results for the auto-correlation\nfunction in this section we take a time-average of the\nauto-correlation function over more than 2 \u00d7 106 collisions. For convenience, in figures the auto-correlation\nfunctions are shown as functions of the correlation number nt , but it can always be translated into the real time\nt by multiplying by the mean free time \u03c4 .\n\nA.\n\nMomentum auto-correlation functions and their\ndirection dependence\n\nFigure 11 contains the momentum auto-correlation\nfunctions Cx and Cy for the momentum components in\nthe x- and y-directions, respectively, as a function of\nthe collision number nt in the quasi-one-dimensional system with N = 100 and (H,P) boundary condition. The\nmain figure in Fig. 11 is a linear-linear plot of the autocorrelation functions Cx and Cy , while its inset is a loglog plot of the graph of the absolute values |Cx | and |Cy |\n\nof the momentum auto-correlation functions. In this system the mean free time is given by \u03c4 \u2248 0.0188. From\nFig. 11 it is clear that the momentum auto-correlation\nfunction has a strong direction dependence and shows a\ntime-oscillating behavior in Cx .\n\nFIG. 11: The auto-correlation function Cx and Cy for the xand y-components of momentum, respectively, as functions\nof the collision number nt . Main figure: Linear-linear plots\nof Cx and Cy as functions of nt . The inset: Log-log plots\nof the absolute values |Cx | and |Cy | of the auto-correlation\nfunctions as functions of nt . Here, the broken line is a fit of\nthe graph of |Cx | to an exponential function, and the line is\na fit of the graph of |Cy | to a \u03ba-exponential function (defined\nby Eq. (21)).\n\nIn the beginning, the auto-correlation function Cx for\nthe x-component of momentum decays exponentially in\ntime. To show this point, in the inset to Fig. 11 we\nfitted the beginning of the graph of |Cx | to an exponential\nfunction\nG1 (x) = exp{\u2212\u03b1\u2032 x}\n\n(19)\n\nwith the fitting parameter value \u03b1\u2032 \u2248 0.0385.\n\nFIG. 12: The time-oscillating part of auto-correlation function Cx for the x-component of momentum as functions of the\ncollision number nt . Here, the line is the fit to the product of\na sinusoidal and an exponential function.\n\nThe significant point about the auto-correlation function Cx is its time-oscillating behavior. To show this\nbehavior explicitly we show Fig. 12 as an enlarged graph\nof the time-oscillating part of Cx , which is already shown\nin Fig. 11. This time-oscillation accompanies a time decay, so we fitted this graph to the product of a sinusoidal\nand an exponential function G2 (x), namely\n\nG2 (x) \u2261 A e\n\n\u2212\u03b2 \u2032 x\n\nsin\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0\nx+\u03be\nTacf\n\n\u0013\n\n(20)\n\nwith fitting parameters A, \u03b2 \u2032 , Tacf , and \u03be. The time\noscillating part of the auto correlation function Cx is\nnicely fitted to this function with the parameter values\nA \u2248 0.0209, \u03b2 \u2032 \u2248 5.17 \u00d7 10\u22125 , Tacf \u2248 8.29 \u00d7 103 , and\n\u03be \u2248 1.62. This also gives us a way of numerically evaluating the oscillation period Tacf of the auto-correlation\nfunction Cx . We note the quasi-one-dimensional system\nshows a much clearer time-oscillating behavior of the momentum auto-correlation function than a fully two- (or\n\n\f11\n\nthree-) dimensional system. One may ask whether the\ndamping behavior of the envelope of time-oscillation of\nCx is best fitted to a power-law function, like the slow\ndamping of the long time behavior of Cy , rather than to\nan exponential function as assumed in Eq. (20). (Actually the data in Fig. 12 is not sufficient to decide between\nexponential and power decay.) This point is discussed\nfurther in Appendix B.\nOn the other hand, the auto-correlation function Cy\nfor the y-component of momentum shows a significantly\ndifferent behavior from Cx . This comes from the specific\nshape of the system and the boundary condition. As\nshown in Fig. 11, the damping of the momentum autocorrelation function Cy in the y-direction is much slower\nthan in the x-direction. This is simply explained by the\nfact that in the quasi-one-dimensional system particle\ncollisions occur mostly as head-on collisions, so that the\nchange in the y-component of momentum in a collision\ncan be much smaller than the change of the x-component\nof momentum. In the inset to Fig. 11 the graph of\nthe auto-correlation function for the y-component of momentum is fitted to the \"\u03ba-exponential function\" F\u03ba (x),\nwhich is defined by\n\nF\u03ba (x) \u2261\n\nhp\ni1/\u03ba\n1 + (\u03b1\u2032\u2032 \u03bax)2 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032\u2032 \u03bax\n,\n\n(21)\n\nin x \u2265 0 with fitting parameters \u03b1\u2032\u2032 and \u03ba. In the collision number region shown in Fig. 11 the auto-correlation\nfunction Cy in the y-direction is positive, so this fitting\ncan be for Cy as well as for |Cy |. From the definition, in\nthe limit as \u03ba = 0 the function F\u03ba (x) becomes the ex\u2032\u2032\nponential function: lim\u03ba\u21920 F\u03ba (x) = exp{\u2212\u03b1\np x}, noting\n\u2032\u2032\nF\u03ba (0) = 1 and \u2202F\u03ba (x)/\u2202x = \u2212\u03b1 F\u03ba (x)/ 1 + (\u03b1\u2032\u2032 \u03bax)2 ,\nso this function is a one-parameter deformation of the\nexponential function [44]. The important properties of\nthis function are that it is approximated by an exponential function at small x and is approximately a power\nfunction in a large x.\n\nB. Particle number dependence of the\nauto-correlation function and a relation with the\ntime-oscillation of the Lyapunov modes\n\nWe have shown the two kinds of time-oscillation behaviors in the quasi-one-dimensional system: one for the\nLyapunov mode and another for the momentum autocorrelation function. Now we show numerical evidence\nto connect these two behaviors.\n\nFIG. 13: The period T\u0304lya (in collision numbers) of the timeoscillation of the Lyapunov mode as a function of the period of time-oscillation of the longitudinal momentum autocorrelation function Tacf . Data points are obtained from numerical calculation of the quasi-one-dimensional system with\n(H,P) boundary condition for different numbers of particles\nN = 40, 50, 60, * * * , 100. The line is given by the function\nT\u0304lya = 2Tacf .\n\nFig. 13 is the graph of the time-oscillating period\nT\u0304lya of the Lyapunov modes as a function of the timeoscillating period Tacf of the momentum auto-correlation\nfunction Cx . Here, the time-oscillating periods are calculated for N = 40, 50, 60, * * * , 100, and the time-oscillating\nperiods T\u0304lya are calculated as the average of the collision number interval Tlya for time-oscillations of the Lya(2N \u22123)\n(2N \u22123)\n/pxj it ,\nit , h\u03b4xj\npunov vector components h\u03b4xj\n(2N \u22123)\n\n/pyj it in the first two-point step of the Lyaand h\u03b4yj\npunov spectra. (As shown in Sect. III G, these three\noscillating periods Tlya of the Lyapunov modes take almost the same values.) In Fig. 13 we also show the line\ngiven by the function T\u0304lya = 2Tacf .

On the other hand, in Ref. [18] we have already\ndiscussed and compared Lyapunov steps and modes in\nthe different boundary conditions: the purely periodic\nboundary conditions (P,P), the purely hard-wall boundary conditions (H,H), and periodic boundary conditions\nin the x-direction and hard-wall boundary conditions in\nthe y-direction (P,H) as well as the boundary condition (H,P). In this section we carry out a similar discussion for the momentum auto-correlation functions Cx in\nthese different boundary conditions. Figure. 14 contains\nschematic illustrations of these boundary conditions.\nFor meaningful comparisons between the different\nboundary conditions we use the same mass m and radius R for the particles, and the same number of particles (N = 50). Using the set of the lengths (Lx , Ly ) to\ndefine the size of the system in the x and y directions for\n(H,P) boundary conditions, then we use (Lx \u2212 2R, Ly )\nfor (P,P) boundary conditions (Lx \u2212 2R, Ly + 2R) for\n(P,H) boundary conditions, and (Lx , Ly + 2R) for (H,H)\nboundary conditions. This gives the same effective area\nfor particles to move in each of the four systems. This\nalso means that the mean free time \u03c4 in these four types\nof the boundary conditions will be the same (Concrete\nnumerical values of \u03c4 are given in Table II.).\n\nCx\n\u03c4 /\u03b2 \u2032\n74.2\n102.5\n156.1\n196.1\n204.5\n252.0\n362.7\n\nCy\nTacf \u03c4\n63.0\n76.0\n96.6\n107.9\n125.0\n139.9\n155.5\n\n\u03c4 /\u03b1\u2032\u2032\n5.33\n5.26\n5.37\n5.26\n4.74\n4.89\n5.27\n\n1/\u03ba\n0.732\n0.716\n0.675\n0.608\n0.577\n0.624\n0.693\n\nFIG. 14: Schematic illustrations of the four boundary conditions (P,P), (P,H), (H,P) and (H,H) used in quasi-onedimensional systems.

Here, Fig. 15(a) is the beginning\npart of the autocorrelation functions Cx , and is given\nas a linear-log plot to show their exponential decay as\nstraight lines. In this figure the fits to the exponential\nfunction (19) with the fitting parameter \u03b1\u2032 are given\nfor the cases (P,P) and (H,P) and the cases (P,H) and\n(H,H) separately.

In the cases (P,P) and\n(H,P) the auto-correlation function Cx shows faster exponential decay than for (P,H) and (H,H), as shown in the\ndifference of the value of the fitting parameter \u03b1\u2032 for the\nexponential fitting function (19). In the collision number\nregion shown in Fig. 15(a), the effects of the boundary conditions in the x-direction in the auto-correlation\nfunction Cx appear after showing their initial exponential decays, and the autocorrelation function Cx for (P,P)\n(and (P,H)) decays faster than Cx for (H,P) (and (H,H)).\nOn the other hand, Fig. 15(b) shows that in all the\nboundary conditions the auto-correlation functions Cx\nshow time-oscillations, but with different oscillating periods Tacf . In this figure we can recognize that the second\npeak of Cx for (P,P) coincides with the first peak of Cx\nfor (H,P). A similar coincidence appears in the second\npeak of Cx for (P,H) and the first peak of Cx in (H,H).\nActually the fitting parameter value of Tacf for (P,P)\n((P,H)) is approximately the half the value of Tacf for\n(H,P) ((H,H)). This can be simply explained by the fact\nthat replacing the periodic boundary conditions with the\nhard-wall boundary conditions, it needs twice the time\nfor a particle perturbation to come back to the same position.\n\nFinally we show a relation between the time-oscillating\nperiods of the Lyapunov mode and the momentum autocorrelation function for different boundary conditions.\nIn Table II we summarize the mean free time \u03c4 , the\ntime-oscillating time period T\u0304lya \u03c4 of the largest Lyapunov mode, and the the time-oscillating time period\nTacf \u03c4 of the momentum auto-correlation function Cx for\nthe four kinds of the boundary conditions (P,P), (P,H),\n(H,P) and (H,H).

Our result\nsupports the conjecture that the relation (23) is satisfied for all boundary conditions (P,P), (P,H), (H,P) and\n(H,H).\nD. An explanation for the relation of\ntime-oscillation periods of the Lyapunov mode and\nthe momentum auto-correlation function\n\nAs we have shown, the relation Tlya = 2Tacf (Eq. (23))\nbetween the largest time-oscillating period Tlya of the\nLyapunov modes and the time-oscillating period Tacf of\nthe momentum auto-correlation function is independent\nof the number of particles N and the boundary conditions. In this subsection we discuss a possible explanation for this relation, which is a physical argument rather\nthan a strict mathematical proof.\nWe consider a momentum component p\u0303x (t), like\nthe x-component of the momentum in the quasi-onedimensional system, which shows a time-oscillating behavior in its auto-correlation function with a frequency\n\u03c9acf :\np\u0303x (t)\u2217 p\u0303x (0) \u223c \u03c6(t) ei\u03c9acf t\n\n(24)\n\nwhere we use the notation X(t)\u2217 X(0) for the autocorrelation function for any complex quantity X(t) with\ncomplex conjugate X(t)\u2217 . Here \u03c6(t) is the damping envelope of the auto-correlation function p\u0303x (t)\u2217 p\u0303x (0), which\ncan be an exponential decay, \u03c6(t) \u223c exp{\u2212\u03b1\u0303t} with a\npositive constant \u03b1\u0303 (See Appendix B.).\nOn the other hand, we represent the momentum proportional and time-oscillating term in the Lyapunov vec-\n\n\f14\n\ntor, like the first terms on the right-hand sides of Eqs.\n(3) and (4), as\n\u03b4 q\u0303x \u223c \u03c81 (t)p\u0303x (t)ei\u03c9lya t\n\n(25)\n\nwith a frequency \u03c9lya , where \u03c81 (t) is the decay envelope of the amplitude of \u03b4 q\u0303x , and may show an exponential divergence (or contraction) following the corresponding Lyapunov exponent. Now, we assume that if\nthe quantity \u03b4 q\u0303x oscillates persistently in time, then its\nauto-correlation function \u03b4 q\u0303x (t)\u2217 \u03b4 q\u0303x (0) should oscillate\nin time with the same frequency \u03c9lya , namely\n\u03b4 q\u0303x (t)\u2217 \u03b4 q\u0303x (0) \u223c \u03c82 (t)ei\u03c9lya t\n\n(26)\nV.\n\nwith a new envelope function \u03c82 (t).\nIt follows from Eqs.

(28) we obtain our relation (23).\nNote that the above explanation for Tlya = 2Tacf is independent of the number of particles N and the boundary\nconditions.\n\n(2N\u22123)\n\nFIG. 16: The normalized auto-correlation function Clya,x\n(2N\u22123)\n\u03b4xj\n\nfor the longitudinal Lyapunov vector component\nas\na function of the collision number nt .

The quasi-one-dimensional system is a narrow rectangular system in which the x components of the particle\npositions remained in the same order. This system was\nproposed as a many-particle system which shows clear\nstepwise structure of the Lyapunov spectrum (the Lyapunov steps) and wave-like structure of the associated\nLyapunov vectors (the Lyapunov modes). Using this system, we showed that there are two types of Lyapunov\nmodes in the spatial and momentum components of the\nLyapunov vectors corresponding to the two kinds of steps\nin the Lyapunov spectrum: one is stationary in time and\nthe other involves a time-oscillation. Here, the timeoscillating Lyapunov vectors consist of a simple timeoscillating part plus a momentum proportional timeoscillating part in the longitudinal components, while\nthe transverse time-oscillating Lyapunov vectors consist\nof a momentum proportional time-oscillating part only.\nWe revealed the phase relation for these time-oscillating\nLyapunov modes. It was shown that the system length\ndivided by the time-oscillating period of the Lyapunov\nmodes is independent of the number of particles at the\nsame density, and is of order of the thermal velocity.\nAfter discussing these wave-like structures of the Lyapunov vectors, we connected them to the time-oscillation\nof the momentum auto-correlation. The time-oscillation\nof the auto-correlation function appears in the longitudinal component of the momentum, and its envelope decays exponentially in time. The main point is that the\nlargest time-oscillating period of the first time-oscillating\nLyapunov modes is twice as long as the time-oscillating\nperiod of the momentum auto-correlation function. We\nshowed that this relation is independent of the number of\nparticles and the boundary conditions (constructed from\ncombinations of periodic and hard-wall boundary conditions). A simple explanation is given for this relation. It\nwas also shown that the auto-correlation function for the\n\n\f15\n\ntransverse component of the momentum is nicely fitted\nto the \u03ba-exponential function, implying that it decays exponentially at the beginning and decays as a power after\nthat.\nIn this paper we considered mainly a specific boundary\ncondition for the quasi-one-dimensional system: (H,P)\nhard-wall boundary conditions in the longitudinal direction and periodic boundary conditions in the transverse direction. The system with this boundary condition exhibit a much clear wavelike-like structure of Lyapunov modes than the purely periodic boundary conditions (P,P), which is a big advantage for quantitative discussions of the Lyapunov modes. Using the (H,P) boundary condition, the spatial translational invariance in the\nlongitudinal direction is violated, and it leads to a different Lyapunov step structure and auto-correlation functions, compared with the (P,P) boundary conditions. For\nexample, in (H,P) the step widths of the Lyapunov spectrum are half of the ones in (P,P), and individual particles\ncan have different momentum auto-correlation functions\ndue to the back scattering effect of the hard-wall (See\nAppendix IV C) while the momentum auto-correlation\nfunction is particle-independent for the (P,P) boundary\ncondition. However, as discussed in Ref. [18] for the Lyapunov modes and in Sec. IV C for the auto-correlation\nfunctions, there is a simple relation connecting the results obtained from different boundary conditions, so we\ncan predict some of the results of the other boundary\nconditions from the results for (H,P).\nThe mode structure of Lyapunov vectors discussed in\nthis paper is related to the structure of the Lyapunov\nvectors associated with zero-Lyapunov exponents. As explained in the introduction of this paper, there are sets\nof Lyapunov vector components which take a constant\nvalue independent of the particle index, and that these\nquantities corresponding to the stepwise structure of the\nLyapunov spectrum have wavelike structures. These are\nconnected with the spatial and time translational invariances and the energy and momentum conservation laws.\nHowever we need to be careful when making a connection between the conservation laws (or the translation\ninvariances) and the Lyapunov modes. For example, in\na system with hard-wall boundary conditions the spatial translational invariance is violated, but even in such\nsystems the mode structure in the Lyapunov vector com(n)\n(n)\nponent \u03b4xj (or \u03b4yj ), can be observed. However, a\nscenario which suggests that translational invariance is\nonly evident when it is observed in the zero-Lyapunov\nexponent modes, will not predict these observed longitudinal modes.\nIt should be noted that a time-dependence of the Lyapunov modes may not always appear as a time-oscillating\nbehavior. Ref. [19] claim that the spatial wave of the\nLyapunov vector \"moves\" at a specific speed in the square\nsystem consisting of many hard-disks. It is interesting\nto know how these different behaviors, one oscillating in\ntime and another moving with a speed, can appear.\nIn some papers, an understanding of the Lyapunov\n\nmodes was attempted based on an analogy with the\nhydrodynamic modes [19]. Actually, in both cases the\nconservation laws like the total momentum conservation\nand the energy conservation play an essential role, and\nthe longitudinal mode shows a time-dependent behavior. However it is important to know that the deterministic nature of orbits also plays one of the essential\nroles in the Lyapunov modes and leads to momentumproportional time-oscillating components of Lyapunov\nvectors, although such a characteristic does not appear\nexplicitly in the hydrodynamic mode. In this sense, it is\nstill an open question to see how hydrodynamic modes,\nwhich have no concept of a phase space trajectory, can\nincorporate time translational invariance.\nFrom results of this paper, it is suggested that there is a\nconnection between existence of the stepwise structure of\nLyapunov spectra and the time-oscillations of momentum\nauto-correlation functions. It is well known that the stepwise structure of the Lyapunov spectra appears clearly in\nrectangular systems rather than in square systems at the\nsame density. It is possible to get a similar result for\nthe time-oscillation of the momentum auto-correlation\nfunction? For example, in a square system with a small\nnumber of hard-disks we cannot observe the stepwise\nstructure of the Lyapunov spectrum, and in this case the\ntime-oscillation of the momentum auto-correlation function does not appear. Therefore, the time-oscillations\nof the auto-correlation function may be useful to understand the condition for existence of the Lyapunov steps\nand modes. In this sense, for example, it may be interesting to investigate the time-correlation function in\nsystems with soft-core particle interactions in which the\nobservation of the Lyapunov steps is much harder, and\nless direct than in systems with hard-core interactions.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nOne of the authors (T.T.) thanks to A.

Different from purely periodic boundary conditions, the hard-wall boundary in (H,P) violates\nthe translation invariance in the longitudinal x-direction,\n\n\f16\n\nand this implies that different particles can have different\nmomentum auto-correlation functions.\n(j)\nWe introduce the auto-correlation function c\u03b7 (t) of\nthe j-th particle in the \u03b7-direction at time t (j =\n1, 2, * * * , N and \u03b7 = x, y) based on the normalized ex(j)\n(j)\n(j)\n(j)\npression c\u03b7 (t) \u2261 c\u0303\u03b7 (t)/c\u0303\u03b7 (0) with c\u0303\u03b7 (t) defined by\n1\nT \u2192+\u221e T\n\nc\u0303(j)\n\u03b7 (t) \u2261 lim\n\nZ\n\nT\n\nds pkj (s + t)pkj (s).\n\n(A1)\n\n0\n\n(j)\n\nUsing this quantity c\u0303\u03b7 (t), the auto-correlation function\nC\u0303\u03b7 (t) defined by Eq. (18) is simply given by C\u0303\u03b7 (t) =\nPN2\n(j)\n[1/(N2 \u2212 N1 + 1)] j=N\nc\u0303\u03b7 (t). In this appendix we\n1\n\nFIG. 18: Exponential decay region of the auto-correlation\n(50)\n(2)\n(1)\n(squares)\nfunctions cx (circles), cx (triangles), and cx\nfor the x-components of momenta, as functions of the collision number nt on a linear-log plot. The solid line (the\n(1)\ndotted-broken lines) is a fit of the graph of cx (the graphs of\n(50)\n(2)\ncx and cx ) to an exponential function. Similar graphs are\ngiven for the auto-correlation functions for the y-component\n(50)\n(2)\n(1)\nof momenta: cy (inverted triangles), cy (pluses), and cy\n(crosses). The broken line (the dotted line) is a fit of the\n(50)\n(2)\n(1)\ngraph of cy (the graphs of cy and cy ) to an exponential\nfunction.\n\n(j)\n\nshow graphs of c\u0303\u03b7 as a function of the collision number\nnt \u2248 t/\u03c4 in the quasi-one-dimensional system consisting\nof 100 hard-disks. We number the particles 1, 2, * * * , N\nfrom the left to right, as shown in Fig. 1, so, for example,\nthe 1st and N -th particles are closest to the hard-walls.\n\n(1)\n\n(20)\n\n(50)\n\nFIG. 17: Auto-correlation functions for cx , cx and cx\nfor the x-components of momenta of the 1st, 20-th, and 50-th\nparticle, respectively, as functions of the collision number nt .\nThe system is a quasi-one-dimensional system of 100 harddisks with (H,P) boundary condition. The inset: Enlarged\ngraphs in the small magnitude part of the auto-correlation\nfunctions.\n\nThe first important point of the individual autocorrelation functions is that the time-oscillation in the\nx-direction is weak for particles near the walls. This is\nshown in Fig. 17, in which we plot the auto-correlation\n(j)\nfunction cx for the j-th particle in the x-direction for\nj = 1 (the nearest particle to the left hard-wall), j = 50\n(the particle most distant from the hard-walls), and\nj = 20 (a particle between these two extremes). In\nFig. 17, the main figure is the full data for these autocorrelation functions, and its inset is an enlarged graph\nto emphasize the time-oscillating part. This figure shows\nthat we cannot recognize a time-oscillating behavior in\n(1)\nthe auto-correlation function cx of the particle nearest\nto the hard-wall, although a clear time-oscillation can be\n(50)\nrecognized in cx of the particle in a middle of the system. We can see a time-oscillating behavior in the auto(20)\ncorrelation function cx , but its amplitude is smaller\n(50)\nthan that of cx . The positions of the nodes of the\n(50)\n(20)\ntime-oscillations of cx and cx almost coincide with\neach other.\nAnother difference between individual particle autocorrelation functions appears in the short time scale. Figure 18 shows the momentum auto-correlation functions\n(j)\nc\u03b7 , j = 1, 2 and 50, as functions of the collision number nt showing the initial damping behavior (\u03b7 = x, y).\n\nThese auto-correlation functions show an exponential decay, which we present as a linear-log plot (straight lines\nimply exponential decay). This figure shows that the xcomponent (y-component) of the auto-correlation function of the particle nearest the hard-wall decays faster\n(slower) than the ones of other particles, while in any of\nthem the damping behavior is nicely fitted to an exponential function. (In Fig. 18 the graphs are fitted to the\nexponential function (19) with the fitting parameter val(2)\n(1)\nues \u03b1\u2032 \u2248 0.0457 for cx (solid line), \u03b1\u2032 \u2248 0.0369 for cx\n(1)\n(50)\nand cx (dotted-broken line), \u03b1\u2032 \u2248 0.00184 for cy (bro(2)\n(50)\nken line), and \u03b1\u2032 \u2248 0.00368 for cy and cy (dotted line)\n). This difference may come from the different types of\ncollisions experienced. For the particle nearest the wall,\nhalf of the collisions will be with the wall and the other\nhalf with the neighboring particle. The x-component of\nthe momentum is drastically changed (namely it changes\nthe sign of pxj ), so it may cause a faster decay of the autocorrelation function in the x-direction than for other\nparticles. On the other hand, collisions with the wall\neffect the y-component of the momentum much less, because it is invariant under wall collisions, and does not\ncause loss of memory of pyj , and this can also explain a\nslower decay of the momentum auto-correlation for the\n1st (and N -th) particle in the y-direction compared to\nother particles.\n\nFIG. 19: The negative region of auto-correlation functions\n(10)\n(5)\n(3)\n(1)\ncx , cx , cx , and cx for the x-components of momenta,\nas functions of the collision number nt as a linear-linear plot.\nThe inset: Absolute values of the same auto-correlation functions as functions of nt as a log-log plot.\n\nAnother point of difference of the auto-correlation\nfunctions of individual particles is a negative region which\nappears after their initial exponential decay. It may be\nmeaningful to mention that a negative region of momentum auto-correlation function has drawn attention\n\n\f17\n\nin some previous works [46, 47, 48]. To discuss such a\nnegative region, in Fig. 19 we show the collision number\n(1) (3)\nnt dependence of the auto-correlation functions cx , cx ,\n(10)\n(5)\ncx , and cx . To emphasize such a negative region of the\nauto-correlation function, we show a log-log plot of the\nabsolute values of the same quantities as functions of nt\nin the inset to Fig. 20. As shown in this figure, a negative\nregion of the auto-correlation functions appears after the\ninitial exponential decay and before the time-oscillates\nappear. The collision number (or time) at the bottom\nof this negative region of the auto-correlation function\nincreases, and the amplitude of the bottom decreases,\nas the particle is further from the hard-wall (namely as\n(j)\nthe particle index j in cx increases from j = 1 to 10\nin Fig. 20). This phenomenon can be explained by the\nbackscattering effect of the hard-walls. Such a back scattering effect is stronger (so the amplitude of the negative\nregion is stronger) in a particle closer to a hard-wall, As\nwell, the time interval to react to the presence of the wall\nis longer (so the time at the bottom of the negative region is later) in a particle far from the hard-wall. This\nkind of behavior is not observed in a system in which the\nboundary conditions in the x-direction are periodic.\n\nFIG. 20: The region before the start of the time-oscillation\n(50)\n(35)\n(20)\n(10)\nof auto-correlation functions for cx , cx , cx and cx as\nfunctions of the collision number nt .\n\nAfter such a negative region of the auto-correlation\nfunction the time-oscillating part appears. Figure 20\nshows the collision number nt dependence of the auto(50)\n(35)\n(20)\n(10)\ncorrelation functions for cx , cx , cx and cx in the\ncollision number region before the time-oscillation of the\nauto-correlation starts (about nt \u2248 6000 in Fig. 20).\nThe negative peak of the auto-correlation function (discussed in the previous paragraph and indicated by the\narrows in Fig. 20) moves to a longer collision number nt\nas the particle index j increase from j = 10 to 35 in Fig.\n20. On the other hand, the time oscillation of the autocorrelation function starts from about nt \u2248 6000 which\nis independent of the particle index, although the amplitude of the time-oscillation is large for a particle far\nfrom the hard-walls. Moreover the time-oscillating period of the auto-correlation function is almost independent of the particle index. These characteristics of the\ntime-oscillation of the auto-correlation function suggest\nthat the time-oscillating behavior of the auto-correlation\nfunction reflects a collective movement of the system.\n\nAPPENDIX B: DAMPING BEHAVIOR OF\nMOMENTUM AUTO-CORRELATION\nFUNCTION IN A LONG TIME INTERVAL\n\nIn this appendix we discuss two points about the momentum auto-correlation function in the long time interval: (i) The shape of the envelop of the time-oscillation\nin the auto-correlation function Cx for the x-component\nof the momentum, and (ii) The behavior of the autocorrelation function Cy of the y-component of the momentum on a much longer time scale than that shown in\nthe text of this paper.\n\nFIG. 21:\n(a) Absolute values |Cx | and |Cy | of the\nauto-correlation functions for the x-component and the ycomponent of the momentum, respectively, as functions of\nthe collision number nt presented as a log-log plot. The solid\nline is a fit of the envelope of the time-oscillating part of the\nauto-correlation function Cx to an exponential function. The\ndotted line is a fit of the auto-correlation function Cy to a\n\u03ba-exponential function (Eq. (21)) and the dotted broken line\nis a fit to an exponential function in the region where there\nis a deviation from the \u03ba-exponential function. (b) The timeoscillating part of the auto-correlation part as a graph of the\nabsolute value |Cx | as a function of the collision number nt\npresented as a linear-log plot. The broken line is a fit to a\nsinusoidal function multiplied by an exponential decay function (Eq. (20)), and the solid line is its envelope, which is the\nsame as the solid line in Fig. (a). The system is a quasi-onedimensional system consisting of 50 hard-disks with (H,P)\nboundary condition.\n\nFigure 21 shows the absolute values of x and y autocorrelation functions |Cx | (|Cy |) as functions of the collision number nt in a quasi-one-dimensional system of 50\nhard-disks with (H,P) boundary condition. In Fig. 21(a)\nthese graphs are plotted as log-log plots, while in Fig.\n21(b) the graph for |Cx | is plotted as a linear-log plot.\nThe collision number interval in this figure is about ten\ntimes as long as the previous ones in this paper, and we\ntook a much longer time-average (eg. over 109 collisions)\nto get this data.\nAs shown in Sec. IV A, the auto-correlation function\nCx for the x-component of the momentum decays exponentially initially. After the initial decay, the timeoscillating region of Cx starts. We fitted this region of\nCx to a sinusoidal function multiplied by an exponential function, namely Eq. (20), with the fitting parameters A \u2248 0.0402, \u03b2 \u2032 \u2248 0.000368, Tacf \u2248 2.03 \u00d7 103 and\n\u03be \u2248 1.53 as the broken lines in Fig. 21(b). The solid lines\nin Fig. 21(a) and (b) are the envelope y = A exp{\u2212\u03b2 \u2032 x}\nof this function. In order to see its exponential behavior\nwe show, in Fig. 21(b), the linear-log plot of |Cx | for the\ntime-oscillating region of Cx , in which the exponential\ndecay is represented as a straight line. In this linear-log\nplot the local maximum points of |Cx | are clearly on a\n\n\f18\n\nstraight line.\nIn Sec. IV A we also showed that the auto-correlation\nfunction Cy for the y-component of the momentum is\nnicely fitted to a \u03ba-exponential function (21). This is also\nshown in Fig. 21(a) as the fit line to the \u03ba-exponential\nfunction with fitting parameter values \u03b1\u2032\u2032 \u2248 0.00746 and\n\u03ba \u2248 1.48 (dotted line). However, Fig. 21(a) shows that\nthere is a deviation from this functional form on a long\ntime scale. Such a deviation is significant in the colli-\n\nsion number region nt > 10000 in this graph. We fitted\nthe auto-correlation function Cy to an exponential function y = A\u2032 exp{\u2212\u03b1\u2032\u2032\u2032 x} with fitting parameter values\nA\u2032 \u2248 0.0369 and \u03b1\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u2248 6.25 \u00d7 10\u22125 (the dotted-broken\nin Fig. 21(a)) in the region where Cy deviates from the\n\u03ba-exponential.\n\n[1] P.
