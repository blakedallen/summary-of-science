These two spaces are not known to most of the\nmathematicians, but they are widely used by physicists. It is possible that, by extending\nthe notion of space, they can become well defined mathematical objects.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn last thirty years physicists have commonly used spaces having non-integer dimensions.\nThese spaces do not have a clear mathematical meaning and it not evident in which sense\nthe name space is not abusive. On the other end it would be very interesting if one could\nproperly define these objects, that are commonly used by physicists. It is possible this task\nmay be achieved by generalizing the notion of space.\nThere are many examples of the previous construction. Here we will concentrate our\nattention on two different cases:\n\u2022 The usual space Rn , when n is no more a positive integer, but it is a real number [1].\n\u2022 The space of matrices n \u00d7 n, for n real. In this case we are mainly interested to study\nin the limit n \u2192 0 [2].\nThe strategy followed by physicists in defining these strange objects consists in picking\nsome properties of bona fine spaces for positive integer n and in making the analytic continuation to non integer n, without paying to much attention to the definition of the objects\nthey are using.\nA clarification of the mathematical structures involved would be extremely interesting\nbecause these spaces are extremely useful and their introduction has a strong heuristic value:\nit allowed us to obtain many results that later on have been proved using conventional\ntechniques. It is unlikely that this task can be done without generalizing the notion of space\nin an appropriate way.\n1\n\n\fThe case of Rn with non-integer n\n\n2\n\nOne of the physical motivations for introducing spaces with non integer dimension is the\nfollowing. There are some physical systems whose properties cannot be computed directly\nin the case of the three dimensional space R3 , however one can formally compute these\nproperties in the space Rn (that has dimension n) for n near to some specific value (e.g.\nn = 4 \u2212 \u01eb [1, 3].\nThe procedure used by physicists for introducing non-integer dimensional spaces is very\nsimple. The properties we would like to compute can be expressed in terms of some integrals.\nIn some cases the integrals can be computed for any dimension and their value can be\nextended to a meromorphic function of the dimensions [4].\nLet us consider a very simple example: the volume of the d-dimensional unitary sphere\nis given by\n\u03c0 d/2\n.\n(1)\nV (d) =\n\u0393(d/2 + 1)\nThe previous formula for V (d) can be extended to an integer function of d for real (and\ncomplex) d. Can one say that for generic real d the volume of the unitary sphere is given by\nV (d)?\nIf an unitary sphere in a space with an non-integer dimension would exist, it is likely that\nits volume would be given by eq. (1). Unfortunately a space with an non-integer dimension\nis not defined and therefore the question of the volume of the unitary sphere is ill-posed.\nNow we could try to reverse the question. We would like to say that a space with noninteger dimensions d is characterized by the property that the volume of the unitary sphere\nis given by eq. (1). Obviously one integral is not sufficient to identify a space and other\nintegrals must be defined (for example the volume of two or more intersecting spheres). On\nthe other hands this construction is likely to be empty; for example for d = \u22123, V (d) = \u22122\u03c0\nis negative and this does not make sense if the integration measure is positive 1 .\nThe program may be the following; one can define geometrical objects (e.g. spheres.\nlines, planes) only giving some rules on how to compute the measure of their intersections,\nwithout making any reference to the coordinates of the space where they are embedded. If\nthe construction is sufficiently rich, we could recover most of the geometrical results without\nhaving to introduce the space. Nothing forbids that some geometrical objects have a negative\nmeasure as far as they do no correspond anymore to real objects in a real space.\nIn the following I will firstly present a tentative construction of the space with non integer\ndimensions along these lines.\n\n2.1\n\nThe construction of a non-integer dimensions space\n\nThe first objects I would like to define are the functions of one (or more) vectors that belong\nto a space with non-integer dimensions. This is standard construction in physics and it has\nbeen discussed with full mathematical rigour by Etingof [4].\nIn the usual integer dimensional case there is no difficulty in defining a mapping from\nRn to the real numbers. If n is non-integer there is no reasonable way to define a generic\n1\n\nAs we shall see later, negative dimensional spaces can be interpreted as positive dimensional spaces where\nsome of the coordinates are anticommuting and the integration measure dd x is not positive definite [5].\n\n2\n\n\fpoint x that belongs to this space, so we cannot define a function F (x) and the question of\ncomputing\nZ\ndn x F (x)\n(2)\n\ndoes not make sense if n is non-integer.\nAn alternative\napproach consists in giving some minimal definition of the function F (x)\nR n\nand defining d x F (x) as a linear functional on the appropriate space without entering in\nthe definition of x.\nLet us consider a simple example of this strategy. We consider a function F (x) of the\nform\nF (x) = f (x2 ) .\n(3)\nIn this case for integer dimensions we have that\nZ\n\ndn x F (x) = nV (n)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\ndssn\u22121 f (s2 ) ,\n\n(4)\n\nThe previous expression defines a linear functional over the functions f that is well defined\nif f (s) goes to zero sufficiently fast when s goes to infinity. The extension to non integer n\npresents no difficulty and one obtains a meromorphic function of s if the function f is C \u221e at\nthe origine.\nThe previous case may seems rather peculiar, however we can extend it to the case where\nthe function F depends on the vectors x only via scalar products with other vectors (y).\nThe whole construction should be invariant under the rotation group O(n), if we rotate the\nvectors x and y.\nThe simplest case are functions of two vectors and three vectors that respectively have\nthe following form:\nG(x, y) = g(x2 , y 2, x * y) ,\n(5)\nand\nH(x, y, z) = h(x2 , y 2 , z 2 , x * y, x * z, y * z) .\n\n(6)\n\nThe integral over x of the previous functions is obviously well defined for integer n and we\nwill show that the final formulae are defined also for non-integer n.\nLet us consider the following expression\nZ\n\ndn y g(y 2, x * y) ,\n\n(7)\n\nevaluated for x2 = r 2 . In the usual case, going to radial coordinates, one finds that\nZ\n\ndn y g(y 2, x * y) = nV (n \u2212 1)\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\ndssn\u22121\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n\nd\u03b8 sin(\u03b8)n f (s2 , sr cos(\u03b8)) .\n\n(8)\n\nThe previous expression makes sense also for non-integer n. In many cases it is a meromorphic\nfunction of n and this allow us to define the r.h.s. of equation (8) also in the region where\nthe integral is not convergent [4].\nThis construction can be generalized to more complex cases; however an alternative and\nsimpler construction, that gives the same results, is the following. We suppose that the\nfunction g has a generalized Laplace transform and that it can be written as:\ng(y 2, x * y) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03b1\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03b2 G(\u03b1, \u03b2) exp(\u2212\u03b1y 2 \u2212 \u03b2x * y) .\n3\n\n(9)\n\n\fUsing standard Gaussian integrals one finds that\nZ\n\nn\n\n2\n\nd y g(y , x * y) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03b1\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u0012 \u0013n/2\n\n\u03c0\nd\u03b2G(\u03b1, \u03b2)\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b2 2r2\nexp\n4\u03b1\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nIn the same way we may easily compute integrals of the form\nZ\n\ndn y g(y 2, y * x1 , . . . , y * xk ) .\n\n(11)\n\nGenerally speaking a function of k vectors depends on the k(k +1)/2 invariants 2 . In other\nwords f is a bona fide function of one variable, g of three variables and h of six variables.\nOnly in our perverse imagination the arguments of the functions F , G and H are vectors in a\nnon-integer dimensional space. The crucial point where the dimension of the space enters is\nwhen we attach a meaning each term of the expression integral of a function over the whole\nspace.\nWe notice that the integral of a positive function is not a priori positive, as can be seen\nfrom formula (8). Indeed the volume of the unit sphere is no more a positive function for\nnegative dimensions. For example negative values for the integral (11) may arise if the k\nvectors xi (i = 1, k) form an orthonormal base and the value of k is larger that the dimension\nof the space. In other words we can always decompose an n dimensional space in the product\nof an usual k dimensional space (with integer k) with a space of dimension n \u2212 k. If n \u2212 k\nis negative the corresponding measure may be no more positive definite. In this case, if we\ndenote yk = xk * y, we get:\nZ\n\nn\n\n2\n\nd y g(y , y1 , y2 , . . . yk ) = (n\u2212k)V (n\u2212k)\n\nZ\n\ndy1 dy2 . . . dyk drr n\u2212k\u22121g(r 2+\n\nX\n\nyi2, y1 , y2 . . . yk ) ,\n\ni=1,k\n\n(12)\nwhere the integral is done on the region r \u2265 0 and it should be understood in distribution\nsense as analytic continuation from the convergence region. In the familiar case k = n we\nrecover the usual formula:\nZ\n\nn\n\n2\n\nd y g(y , y1, y2 , . . . yk ) =\n\nZ\n\ndy1 dy2 . . . dyk g(\n\nX\n\nyi2 , y1, y2 . . . yk ) .\n\n(13)\n\ni=1,k\n\nIn a similar way we can define derivatives, Laplacians and so on. Generally speaking we\ncan study vector-valued functions, under the constraint that they transform in a covariant\nway under the rotational group: e.g.\nx\u03bc f (x2 ) .\n(14)\nIn other words we study our space using the filter of rotational invariance: we consider\nonly rotational invariant (or covariant) functions and we define a set of transformations (e.g.\nintegrals and derivatives) that depend analytically on a parameter n; for integer values of n\nthese transformations coincide with the usual ones for functions defined on a n-dimensional\nspace.\n2\n\nFor integer n and sufficiently large k the k(k + 1)/2 invariants are not independent quantities, however\nthis fact does not concern us directly, because we are considering a generic dimensional space.\n\n4\n\n\fIn general the geometrical meaning of this construction is unclear. The only case where\nthere is a simple geometrical interpretation is the case of negative integer dimensions. For\nexample in the case of n = \u22122 we have that\nZ\n\n\u22122\n\nd xF (x) = \u22122\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nd\u03b8d\u03b8F (\u03b8) ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is an anticommuting variable.

For example in the SherringtonKirkpatrick model for spin glasses the partition function is given by\nZJ (N) =\n\nX\n{\u03c3}\n\n\uf8eb\n\nexp \uf8ed\u03b2\n\nX\n\ni,k=1,N\n\n\uf8f6\n\nJi,k \u03c3i \u03c3k \uf8f8 ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the sum over {\u03c3} denotes the sum over the 2N configurations of the N variables\n\u03c3i that may tale only the values \u00b11. The measure d\u03bc(J) is a Gaussian measure over the\nN(N +1)/2 components of the symmetric J matrix whose elements are identically distributed\nuncorrelated Gaussian variables with zero average and variance N \u22121 .\nIn the usual approach it is convenient to define the quantity\n\u2212 \u03a6(N, n) = (Nn)\n\n\u22121\n\nln\n\n\u0012Z\n\nd\u03bc(J)(ZJ (N)\n\nn\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(20)\n\nAs it can be trivially seen, if the appropriate integrals are convergent, \u03a6(N, n) is an analytic\nfunction of n, that is regular around n = 0, and\nf (N) = lim \u03a6(N, n) .\nn\u21920\n\n5\n\n(21)\n\n\fThis baroque construction has been introduced because in some problems for integer n one\ncan perform the integration over the variables J and one can prove the following exact formula\n[2, 6]:\nZ\nexp(\u2212Nn\u03a6(N, n)) =\n\ndQ exp(\u2212NFn (Q)) ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the integral is done over all n \u00d7 n matrices Qa,b (a, b = 1, n). such that its diagonal\nelements are equal to 1 (i.e. Qa,a = 1). Using the method of the point of maximum one can\nrigorously prove that for integer n\n\u03c6(n) \u2261 lim \u03a6(N, n) = Fn (Q\u2217 ) ,\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the matrix Q\u2217 minimizes the function Fn (Q).\nForgetting physical motivations the mathematical problem is the following: given a function Fn (Q) defined on n \u00d7 n matrices one should go through the following steps:\n1. To prove that the quantity \u03a6(N, n) defined in eq. (22) can be extended to an analytic\nfunction of n.\n2. To prove that the limit f (N) = limn\u21920 \u03a6(N, n) exists.\n3. To prove that the quantity f (N) has a limit (f ) when N goes to infinity.\n4. To give a closed expression for the quantity f .\nOf course everything depends on the form of the function Fn (Q). For example in the case\nwhere\n\u03b2\n(24)\nFn (Q) = Tr(Q2 )\n2\neverything is trivial. One explicitly finds that\n\u03b2\nn\u22121\nln\n\u03a6(N, n) = \u2212\n2\n2\u03c0\n\n!\n\n(25)\n\nand all the issues on the dependence on n and N of \u03a6(N, n) can be easily settled.\nIf the function \u03a6(N, n) has also the representation eq. (20), points 1 and 2 are easy,\npoints 3 is more difficult, but it can be solved in some interesting cases [13]. At the present\ntime points 4 does not have a rigorous mathematical solution in the general case,\nIn order to gave an idea of the problems physicists are interested, it is convenient to write\ndown some of the functions that have been studied in the literature.\nFn (Q) = \u2212Tr[ln(Q)] + \u03b2 2 Tr(Q2 )\nX\nFn (Q) = \u2212Tr[ln(Q)] + \u03b2 2 (Qa,b )3\n\n(26)\n\na,b\n2\n\nFn (Q) = \u2212Gn (Q) + \u03b2 Tr(Q2 )\n\nwhere in the last case (that correspond to the SK model, where we have that:\nexp(nGn (Q)) =\n\nY\n\na=1,n\n\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\nX\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\n\uf8fb exp \uf8ed\nQa,b \u03c3a \u03c3b \uf8f8\n\n\u03c3a =\u00b11\n\n6\n\na,b\n\n(27)\n\n\fThe physicists have used the following approach. For integer n the matrix Q\u2217 that minimizes the function Fn (Q) can be easily found and in this way one computes \u03c6(n) for integer\nn. Usually \u03c6(n) has a simple expression that can be analytically continued to n = 0. We\nwould naturally guess that this analytic continuation gives the exact result.\nHowever in general this is not the correct procedure. The function \u03c6(n) is defined as the\ninfinite N limit of \u03a6(N, n) and, although \u03a6(N, n) is analytic in n, the function \u03c6(n) may be\na non-analytic function of n (e.g. it may have a singularity in the interval 0-1) so that the\nanalytic continuation of \u03c6(n) is not the limit for N going to infinity of \u03a6(N, n). In some\ncrucial cases is was proved that this happens (the naive approach gives inconsistencies) and\nsomething else should be tried [8],\nThe next approach consists in trying to use the method of the point of maximum directly\nfor non integer n, with all possible complications that may arise in dealing directly with\nfunctions defined on a non integer dimensions case [8]. This approach is consistent (in the\nsense that the final results are not contradictory). Its results have not yet been proved to\nbe correct and goes under the name of spontaneously broken replica symmetry (the naive\napproach is usually called the replica symmetric one).\nIt is a great challenge to people working in probability theory to prove (or to disprove)\nthat the results of the replica broken approach are correct [12].\n\n3.2\n\nThe replica symmetry\n\nWe have already seem that symmetry considerations play a crucial role in defining quantities\non non-integer dimensional spaces. It is therefore reasonable to investigate the symmetry\nproperties of our problems. Moreover the presence of a symmetry group in a function F\nallow us to divide the set of its stationary points into orbits under the action of symmetry\ngroup.\nLet us introduce the usual permutation group Sn (i.e. the replica group) and let us denote\nby \u03c0(a) (for a = 1, n) the element where a is carried by the permutation \u03c0. The permutation\ngroup (that is a subgroup of the rotational group) acts in a canonical way on the matrices\nQ, permuting both row and columns:\nQ\u03c0a,b = Q\u03c0(a),\u03c0(b) .\n\n(28)\n\nIn the cases we are interested the permutation group is a symmetry of the problem, i.e.\nF (Q\u03c0 ) = F (Q). This symmetry is related to the procedure used in the construction of the\nfunction F it is clearly exact in the examples we have considered.\nIf a function F has a symmetry, the symmetric point is a natural candidate for a minimum:\nit is automatically a stationary point, i.e. a solution of the equation\n\u2202F\n=0.\n\u2202Qa,b\n\n(29)\n\nA matrix that is left invariant by the action of the permutation group must have all offdiagonal elements equal:\nQa,b = q for a 6= b .\n(30)\n(The diagonal elements of Q are equal to one by construction.)\n7\n\n\fHowever the symmetric solution of equation (29) does not need to be a minimum, it may\nbe a maximum, or a saddle. In order to establish the nature of the symmetric solution we\nhave to compute the eigenvalues of the Hessian\nHa,b;c,d =\n\n\u22022F\n.\n\u2202Qa,b Qc,d\n\n(31)\n\nIn one of the most interesting cases (the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model for spin glasses [6],\ni.e. the last of our examples) one finds that the eigenvalues of the Hessian are all positive for\npositive integer n, their analytic continuation is still positive for n > nc , but some of them\nchange sign at nc where 0 < nc < 1 [7]. By changing the parameter n a minimum becomes\na saddle point and an other stationary point becomes the true minimum: this a very usual\nphenomenon (e.g. a bifurcation or spontaneous symmetry breaking) in an unusual setting.\n\n3.3\n\nBreaking the replica symmetry\n\nIf the symmetric point is not a minimum, we can look for a minimum that is not symmetric.\nIn this case physicists say that the symmetry group is spontaneously broken. The subgroup\nthat leaves invariant the true minimum (the little group) is the surviving (or unbroken)\nsymmetry group.\nOur task is to find a new candidate for a minimum. Different attempts have been done.\nThe most promising candidate [8, 9] is given by the matrix Q, whose off-diagonal elements\ncan be written as\nQa,b = q1\nQa,b = q0\n\nif I(a/m) = I(b/m) ,\nif I(a/m) =\n6 I(b/m) ,\n\n(32)\n\nwhere I(x) is the integer part of x and m is an integer that divides n. Obviously if q1 = q0 = q\nwe recover the previous case. The symmetry group that leaves invariant this matrix is (for\nq1 6= q0 ) the semidirect product of Sn/m with the direct product of n/m copies of Sm and it\nis obviously a subgroup of Sn .\nThe value of F (Q) evaluated at this saddle point gives a function F (q0 , q1 , m), that can\nbe written in a relatively simple form, depending on the model (in the worst case it involves\na few integrals).\nNow a natural question is which values of m are allowed. Originally m should be an\ninteger that divides n, however, when n is no more an integer, there is apparently no reason\nfor imposing that m remains an integer. It is clear that we are in a nobody land and any\nprescription is arbitrary. We will present the standard prescription, that may justified a\nposteriori by its success in giving sensible results, that are quite likely the correct ones. We\nwill follow the rules:\n\u2022 Non-integer values of m are allowed as soon as n is no more a positive integer.\n\u2022 The interesting region for m is 1 \u2264 m \u2264 n for n > 1 and n \u2264 m \u2264 1 for n < 1.\n\u2022 We look for a stationary point that satisfies the condition that all the eigenvalues of H\nare positive in order to find the minimum of F (Q). In the previous defined interesting\n8\n\n\fregion (n \u2264 m \u2264 1 for n < 1) this condition implies that F (q0 , q1 , m) is a maximum\nas function of q0 and q1 . This confusing situation is due to the fact the if the number\nof dimensions is negative, the two conditions (H has non negative eigenvalues and\n(x, Hx) \u2265 0) are not equivalent.\n\u2022 By uniformity we decide that the function F (q0 , q1 , m) should also maximized with\nrespect to m. The final prescription consists in finding the maximum with respect all\nthe three arguments.\nThis prescription is called one step replica symmetry breaking. In certain models it\nis believed to give the exact results. i.e. in the cases for which one obtains a non-negative\nHessian (an alternative approach to these models is sketched in the appendix). In other cases\n(e.g. in the SK model) one does not obtain a non negative value of the Hessian although\nthe absolute value of the negative eigenvalue decrease be a large factor (around 10). The\nprescription we have introduced is apparently able to compute in an exact way the quantity\nf in some models. In the other models, where it does not give a consistent result, it is a step\ntoward the correct solution, that will be found in the next section.\n\n3.4\n\nFull replica symmetry breaking\n\nAs we have mentioned before the one step replica symmetry scheme does not produce consistent results in the case of the SK model. If we pay attention to the scheme that we have\nused to break the permutation group, the statements of the previous section corresponds to\nsaying that in the limit n \u2192 0 the unbroken subgroup of Sn is the semidirect product of\nthe group S0 with the direct product of zero copies of the group Sm . In other words the\ngroup S0 contains itself as a subgroup and it is therefore an infinite group (it also contains\ninfinitesimal elements [10]). This fact may be not surprising if we ponder the fact the group\nS0 is obtained as analytic continuation of all the Sn groups, with arbitrary n.\nOne can generalize the formula eq. (32) to the case where there are k + 1 parameter qk\nand k parameter mk . The previous formulae correspond to the case k = 1. We present the\nexplicit construction in the case k = 2. We assume the n is a multiple of m2 and m2 is a\nmultiple of m1 . The off-diagonal elements of the matrix Q, can be written as\nQa,b = q1\n\nQa,b = q2 if I(a/m2 ) = I(b/m2 ) ,\nif I(a/m2 ) 6= I(b/m2 ) and I(a/m1 ) = I(b/m1 ) ,\nQa,b = q0 if I(a/m1 ) =\n6 I(b/m1 ) ,\n\n(33)\n\nIt is remarkable that after a permutation one could write write such a matrix under the form\nQa,b = Q(a \u2212 b), where the function Q(a) is a simple function of a [11]. Indeed this happens\nif we set\nQ(a) = q1\n\nif n/m1\n\nQ(a) = q2 if n/m2 divides a ,\ndivides a and n/m2 does not divide a,\nQ(a) = q0 if n/m1 does not divide a,\n\n(34)\n\nIt is not clear if this translational invariant formulations, that is at the heart of the p-adic\napproach [11], has a deeper meaning (up to this moment it has been used only at the technical\nlevel).\n9\n\n\fAlso in this case we first compute the function F for integer n, m1 and m2 and we\nanalytically continue the result up to n=0 3 . At the end of the computation we do not\nrequire any more that the m's are integer. The final expression is maximized as function of\nthe q's and of the m's, that turn out to be in the region 0 < m1 < m2 < 1. In the case where\nthe one step solution is not good, (i.e. negative Hessian) also the two steps solution is not\ngood (the Hessian is still negative).\nIt is clear that this construction can go on for any number of steps we want in a recursive\nway. A detailed computation shows that we always find the the Hessian is negative (for\nexample in the SK model near the critical temperature the minimum eigenvalue of the Hessian\nis \u2212A(2k + 1)\u22122 with positive A). It seems reasonable that the interesting case correspond\nto the limit k \u2192 \u221e.\nIn order to control better the k \u2192 \u221e it is important that for finite k and in the limit\nn \u2192 0 the interesting solutions of the stationary equation \u2202F/\u2202Qa,b are always in the region\n0 \u2261 m0 < m1 . . . < mk < 1 \u2261 mk+1 .\n\n(35)\n\nOne can thus associate to the matrix Q a piecewise constant function q(x) such that\nq(x) = qi for\n\nmi < x < mi+1 .\n\n(36)\n\nIf we send k to infinity, one finds by an esplicite computation that the function q(x) becomes\na continuous function. In this way we have a canonical way to associate to a function q(x) a\nmatrix in the space of zero by zero matrices.\nThe introduction of the function q(x) is not so arbitrary, Indeed simple expressions can\nbe obtained for the Sn -invariants in the limit of n going to zero also for finite k. I present\njust two simple examples:\nlim n\u22121 Tr(Q2 ) = 1 \u2212\n\nlim n\u22121 Tr(Q3 ) = 1 \u2212 3\n\nn\u21920\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n0\n\ndxq(x)2 +\n\n3Z 1\ndx\n2 0\n\nn\u21920\nZ 1\nx\n\ndyq(x)q(y)2 +\n\nZ\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n\ndxq(x)2 ,\n\n1Z\ndxxq(x)3 .\n2 0\n\n(37)\n\nThe last formula is related to the formula for the volume of the intersection of three p-adic\nspheres [11].\nA more complex example is given by the quantity G(0), defined in eq. (27): a non trivial\ncomputation implies that\nG(0) = f (0, 0) ,\n(38)\nwhere the function f (x, h) is defined in the strip 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1, \u2212\u221e < h < \u221e and it satisfies\nthe following non-linear differential equation :\n\uf8eb\n\n\u2202f\n1 dq \uf8ed \u2202 2 f\n\u2202f\n=\u2212\n+\nx\n\u2202x\n2 dx \u2202h2\n\u2202h\n\n!2 \uf8f6\n\nthe with the boundary conditions\n\n\uf8f8\n\nf (1, h) = ln(cosh(\u03b2h)).\n3\n\nThe group properties of this solution are discussed in details in [14].\n\n10\n\n.\n\n(39)\n\n(40)\n\n\fIn all the previous cases the end of the computation the free energy becomes a functional\nof the function q(x) (F [q]) and this functional has an explicit expression that in some cases\nmay be rather complex. Maximizing the functional F [q] (and depending on the temperature\nrange this can be done or analytically or numerically) one finds a consistent solution of many\nmodels (including the SK model) such that all the infinite eigenvalues of the Hessian 4 are\nnon negative. Moreover this solutions satisfies all inequalities that one derive from general\nprinciples (e.g. positivity of the entropy).\nIt obvious that all this does not make sense from a strict mathematical point of view because the prescriptions we have used are somewhat arbitrary, although they look reasonable.\nOn the other ends the replica method has been very successfully as can be seen in the next\nsection.\n\n4\n\nThe success of the replica method\n\nIn the case of the Sherrington Kirkpatrick model the first success of the replica method,\nespecially in the case of full replica symmetry breaking, is the existence of a consistent\nsolution (a result that is not evident a priori).\nIt is also remarkable that in all the many infinite range models, where the replica method\nhas applied, the results are in a very good agreement with the computer simulations and\nthey coincide with the exact results, when available.\nIt is very interesting that one can rederive most of the results of the replica method,\nwithout using replicas, but doing probabilistic arguments. It appears that the form of the\nmatrix Q codes some information on the probability distribution of the equilibrium configurations of the system in a way that it would take too much time to explain [8, 9]. We only\nsay that the organization of the pure states of the systems (called lumps by Talagrand [12]\nin this context) mirrors the form of the matrix Q: e.g. the ultrametric form of the matrix\nq, that is a remnant of its p-adic origine, implies that the distances among states satisfy\nthe ultrametric inequality. This alternative probabilist approach is not evident and it was\nfound a few years after the establishment of the replica approach. Moreover in some models\nnon-trivial rigorously results have been obtained that point toward the correctness of the\nresults obtained via the replica method [12].\nMost recently in a very clever paper Guerra have been able to prove that in the SK model\n(and in similar models) the following inequality si satisfied:\nf \u2265 F [q] \u2200q(x) .\n\n(41)\n\nThis result is important because it shows that the functional F [q], that is obtained via the\nreplica method, is related to the true value (f ) of the free energy.\nThe same results of the replica method may be obtained in the framework of off-equilibrium\ndynamics that has been shown to be equivalent to the replica method [15, 16]. Recent experimental results [17] beautifully confirm the theoretical predictions of this approach.\n4\n\nThe Hessian becomes now a rather complex integral operator and it has both an infinite point spectrum\nand a continuous spectrum.\n\n11\n\n\fThe existence of alternative routes clearly shows that the results make sense. In any case\nthe replica method has a very strong heuristic value and it would be surprising if we could\nnot assign a precise mathematical meaning to such an useful method.\n\nAppendix\nIn this appendix we report an explicit computation in the case of one step replica symmetry\nbreaking that may have some chance to be the starting point of a rigorous mathematical\napproach [18]. As we shall see, this result suggests that there is a correspondence from a\nclass of 0 \u00d7 0 matrices with an infinite set of n \u00d7 n matrices for any n.\nAt the technical level the idea is relatively simple. We write for negative s\n\u0393(\u2212s)Z s =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndtt\u22121\u2212s exp(\u2212tZ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n0\n\ndtt\u22121\u2212s\n\n(\u2212t)n n\nZ ,\nn!\nn=0,\u221e\nX\n\n(42)\n\nwhere everything has an implicit dependence on N and the bar denotes the average over J.\nIf we continue the previous formula up to s \u2192 0 we obtain and expression for ln(Z s )\nIf we can control the expression for Z n with sufficient accuracy when N \u2192 \u221e, we have\ndone our job. This task is not easy, because of possible cancellations due to the minus signs:\nthe leading term of the sum may be not the sum of the leading terms for Z n and therefore\nwe have to control Z n with a very high accuracy.\nWe have already seen that the quantity Z n has an exact expression that is given by eq.\n(22). An interesting conjecture is that we obtain the asymptotically correct result for Z s , if\ninside eq. (42) we make the approximation\nZn \u2248\n\nX\n\nexp(\u2212NFn (Q\u2217 )) ,\n\n(43)\n\nQ\u2217\n\nwhere the sum is done over all the n \u00d7 n matrices Q\u2217 that are local minima of Fn (Q). This\napproximation obviously gives the asymptotically dominant result for Z n , where only the\nglobal minimum counts, however it is not evident that it gives the correct result when it is\nused for computing Z s .\nIn the general case we do not know if conjecture is true, how to compute all the mimima\nand if this conjecture does reproduce the result of the replica approach. However in some\nmodels where replica symmetry is broken at one step, the appropriate computations can be\ndone [18] and one finds the same result obtained with the replica method.\nThere is indeed a class of models where for positive integer n all the minima of F [Q] can\nbe obtained in the following way: one divides the indices in M sets of size mk (k = 1, M)\nP\nwhere k mk = n. One sets\nQa,b = qk ,\n(44)\nif both a and b belongs to the k th set; otherwise one has Qa,b = 0. In some cases [18] one\nfinds that if the leading contribution (that coming from the global minimum) for each n is\nused, the result coincides with the one coming form the replica symmetric approximation\n(that for a certain range of the parameters is not correct). One the other end, if one consider\nthe contribution coming from all possible minima (that are subdominant for give n), at the\n12\n\n\fend one recovers the replica broken result where one has to find the maximum of the free\nenergy for m in the region 0 \u2264 m \u2264 1.\nWe have no idea of how the afore-mentioned conjecture can be proved and it would be\ninteresting to test it in a wider context. We have mentioned it here because it hints that\nthe matrices for non integer n and m used in the replica method are related to families of\nmatrices that are defined for all integer n.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
