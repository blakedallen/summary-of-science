A qualitative separation is usually done between classical v \u223c 100 \u2212 1000 km s\u22121 warm absorbers,\nwe refer to here (throughout paper) as low-velocity outflows\n(Blustin et al. 2005; McKernan et al. 2007), and ultra-fast\noutflows (UFOs) v > 10, 000 km s\u22121 , we refer to here as\nhigh-velocity outflows (Tombesi et al. 2010a,b).\nOn one hand, the extracted velocity from the classical\nv \u223c 100 \u2212 1000 km s\u22121 warm absorber is mainly obtained\nusing the Fe M-shell 2p \u2212 3d unresolved transition array\n(UTA) (Behar et al. 2001; Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. 2008), and O vii\nor O viii resonance lines (e.g., George et al. 1998, the hallmark of the classical warm absorber). The spatial location\nof this absorbing material is uncertain. Models of X-ray absorbers in AGN place them at a wide range of distances\nfrom the central source. Specifically they are suggested to\nbe winds originating from the accretion disk (Murray et al.\n1995; Elvis 2000), located at the dusty (\u223c 1 pc) torus scales\n(Krolik & Kriss 2001) or even beyond the narrow-line region\n(e.g. Ogle et al. 2000).\nOn the other hand, blueshifted Fe K absorption lines\nhave been detected in recent years at E > 7 keV\nin the X-ray spectra of several radio-quiet AGNs (e.g.,\nChartas et al. 2002, 2003; Pounds et al. 2003; Dadina et al.\n2005; Markowitz et al. 2006; Braito et al. 2007; Ram\u0131\u0301rez\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail:jramirez@aip.de\n\n2008; Cappi et al. 2009; Reeves et al. 2009; Tombesi et al.\n2010a,b). They are usually interpreted as due to resonant\nabsorption from Fe xxv-xxvi associated with a zone of circumnuclear gas photoionized by the central X-ray source,\nwith ionization parameter log \u03be \u223c 3 \u2212 6 erg/s cm and column density NH \u223c 1022 \u2212 1024 cm\u22122 . The energies of\nthese absorption lines are systematically blueshifted and the\ncorresponding velocities can reach up to mildly relativistic values of \u223c 0.03c \u2212 0.3c. These findings are important\nbecause they suggest the presence of previously unknown\nmassive and highly ionized absorbing material outflowing\nfrom their nuclei, possibly connected with accretion disk\nwinds/ejecta (e.g., King & Pounds 2003; Proga & Kallman\n2004; Sim et al. 2008; Ohsuga et al. 2009; King 2010b;\nSim et al. 2010).\nSeveral acceleration mechanisms have been proposed to explain these outflows: (1) thermally accelerated winds (Krolik & Kriss 2001); (2) radiation pressure\nthrough Thomson scattering and magnetic forces (MHD,\nOhsuga et al. 2009); (3) and radiation pressure due to the\nabsorption of spectral lines (e.g., Proga & Kallman 2004;\nRam\u0131\u0301rez 2008; Schurch et al. 2009; Sim et al. 2010; Ram\u0131\u0301rez\n2011). Although the first one can explain the velocities we\nobserve in the low-velocity outflows, it can be excluded because it can not explain the \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.2c we observe in\nUFOs (Tombesi et al. 2010a,b). Ohsuga et al. (2009) seem\nto reproduce the velocities observed in low- and high-velocity\noutflows. On the other hand, Arav et al. (1994); Ram\u0131\u0301rez\n(2008); Saez et al. (2009); Chartas et al. (2009), invoke radiation pressure due to lines to explain the \u223c 0.2c outflow\n\n\f2\n\nRam\u0131\u0301rez and Tombesi\n\ndetected in a good S/N X-ray spectrum of a high-z quasar\n(the broad absorption line [BAL], APM 08279+5255), and\nthey reproduce, as part of the procedure, the Fe xxv-xxvi\nlines detected at E > 7 keV. Here we focus on this kind\nof approach, since it allows us to explore, very efficiently, a\nwide range of physical parameters of the system.\nThe goal of this Letter is to place a proof of idea\nfor a systematic study about the operating acceleration\nmechanisms in both; X-ray low- and high-velocity outflows,\nusing an anisotropic radiative pressure framework (e.g.,\nProga et al. 2000; Proga & Kallman 2004; Liu & Zhang\n2011), beginning with line radiation pressure.\nWe present the observables from which we build the\nmodel in \u00a72. The details of the proposed model are presented\nin \u00a73. The results and the discussion are in \u00a74. We summarize\nin \u00a75.\n\n2\n\nOBSERVABLES\n\nIn this section we present the observables of the two types\nof outflows, since they are the initial motivation for the proposed model.\n\n2.1\n\nThe low-velocity outflows\n\nWhen describing the physical conditions of warm absorbers,\nit is common to use the definition of ionization parameion\nter \u03be = 4\u03c0F\n(Tarter et al. 1969), where Fion is the total\nnH\nionizing flux (Fion = Lion /4\u03c0r 2 ), and nH is the gas density. The source spectrum is described by the spectral (specific, energy dependent \u01eb) luminosity L\u01eb = Lion f\u01eb , where\nion is the integrated luminosity from 1 to 1000 Ryd, and\nRL1000\nRyd\nf\u01eb d\u01eb = 1.\n1\nSo we describe the \u223c 1000 km s\u22121 warm absorber outflows as absorbing material around a supermassive black\nhole (SMBH) with mass MBH \u223c 3 \u00d7 107 (Peterson et al.\n2004; Blustin et al. 2005), column density of the absorbing material NH \u223c 1020 \u2212 1022 cm\u22122 , flowing outwards at\nvelocities v \u223c 100 \u2212 2000 km s\u22121 (e.g., Kaspi et al. 2002;\nKrongold et al. 2003, 2005; Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. 2005), at medium\nionization states log \u03be \u223c 0 \u2212 3 erg s\u22121 cm (Blustin et al.\n2005).\nWhen computing the energetics they find mass loss\nrates of 1 \u1e40out \u2248 0.6 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ratios of \u1e40out to accretion rates 2 , \u1e40out /\u1e40acc \u2248 5 and kinetic luminosity 3\nv2\nLEK = \u1e40out\n, of the orders of 1038 \u2212 1041 erg/s, represent2\ning less than 1 % of the bolometric luminosity (Blustin et al.\n2005). The main conclusion from these estimations is that\nthese outflows contributes little to the energy injected in to\nthe host galaxy. But the amount of matter processed over\nthe AGN lifetime can be significant (also in accordance with\nKrongold et al. 2007, for instance).\n\n1\n\nMean of the \u1e40out reported by Blustin et al. (2005) in their\nTable 4, excluding Ark 564 (outlier \u1e40out = 23 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ).\n2 Mean of the \u1e40\nout /\u1e40acc reported by Blustin et al. (2005) in\ntheir Table 4, excluding Ark 564 (outlier \u1e40out /\u1e40acc = 550).\n3 Excluding PG 0844+349 and PG 1211+143.\n\n2.2\n\nThe high-velocity outflows\n\nThe characteristics of the ultra-fast outflows with v>10,000\nkm s\u22121 (>0.03c) can be derived from the blue-shifted\nFe xxv-xxvi absorption lines detected by Tombesi et al.\n(2010b) in a complete sample of local Seyfert galaxies. Such\nfeatures are detected in \u223c40\u201360% of the sources, which suggests a covering fraction of C\u223c0.5. Tombesi et al. (2011)\nalso performed a photo-ionization modeling of these lines.\nThey derived the distribution of the outflow velocities, which\nranges from \u223c0.03c up to mildly relativistic values of \u223c0.3c,\nwith a peak and mean value at \u223c0.14c. As expected, these\nabsorbers are highly ionized, with log\u03be\u223c3\u20136 erg s\u22121 cm,\nand have large column densities, in the range NH \u223c1022 \u2013\n1024 cm\u22122 .\nThe SMBH masses of the Seyferts in the Tombesi et al.\n(2010b) sample have a mean value of MBH = 5.3 \u00d7 107 M\u2299\n(Marchesini et al. 2004; Peterson et al. 2004).\nWhen computing the energetics of these outflows, we\nsee that these are more massive than the low-velocity ones,\n\u1e40out \u223c 0.1 \u2212 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 \u223c\u1e40acc , and also much more powerful, with a mechanical power of \u223c1043 \u20131045 erg/s (e.g.,\nPounds et al. 2003; Markowitz et al. 2006; Braito et al. 2007;\nCappi et al. 2009; Tombesi et al. 2010b). The latter value is\n\u223c 5 \u2212 10% of the bolometric luminosity. Therefore, the highvelocity outflows may potentially play an important role on\nthe expected cosmological feedback from AGNs (e.g., King\n2010a,b).\n\n3\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nWe build our model based on observational evidence, basically from two sources: Blustin et al. (2005) for the classical v \u223c 100 \u2212 1000 km s\u22121 warm absorbers, referred here\nas low-velocity outflows, and Tombesi et al. (2010b) for the\nultra-fast outflows (UFOs) v > 10, 000 km s\u22121 , referred here\nas high-velocity outflows.\nAs we see, together the two classes of outflows cover\na wide range in velocity and black hole masses. We seek a\nphysical model which provides the context to explain (to\nfirst approximation), part of the observational evidence we\nhave up to now.\nIn order to do that, and to gain some insight into the\nrelationship between outflow velocity (vout ) and luminosity,\nwe invoke the velocity profile as a function of radius, given by\nhydrodynamical calculations (Proga et al. 2000). The mathematical shape of the relation is given by assuming an outflow accelerated by radiation pressure from a central source\nwith a bolometric luminosity Lbol , and a mass of MBH :\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u00151/2\nLbol [i]\n1\n1\nvout [i] = 2GMBH [i] \u0393f\n\u2212\n\u22121\n, (1)\nLEdd [i]\nRin\nR\nwhere LEdd is the Eddington luminosity, \u0393f is the force multiplier, where the acceleration due to the absorption of discrete lines is encapsulated (Laor & Brandt 2002), Rin is the\nradius at which the wind is launched from the disk, and R is\nthe distance of the accelerated portion of the outflow from\nthe central source. The index i, runs simultaneously over\nthe two distributions: velocity/BH mass. Assuming that we\nobserve the gas when it has reached the terminal velocity of\nthe wind, i.e. vout at R = \u221e, we can write:\n\n\flow- and high-velocity outflows\n(2)\n\n4\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this section we discuss the results of our simulated samples and summarize their physical context and implications.\nFigure 1 shows the theoretical relationship between outflow velocity and bolometric luminosity.\nThe curvature we see in vout of set 2 (and also set 1,\nfilled circles, our line of sight is along the flow, see below), is\ndue to the quadratic dependence of the luminosity with vout\ngiven by equation 2. It is worth noticing that if we assume\na force multiplier of \u0393f = 40 (this is the best-fit value for\nset 2 and set 4, see section 3) ; we are able to reproduce\nthe range of luminosities seen in Figure 4 of Blustin et al.\n(2005).\nOn the other hand this model is not reproducing well\nthe dispersion we observe in Figure (4) of Blustin et al.\n(2005), which could be explained by the fact that equation\n2 will give radially accelerated flows, or in other words, that\n4 We take the middle point (\u03bc\n7\nm = 2.6 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 ) between the\nmean extracted from Tombesi et al. (2011) (\u03bcm = 5.3\u00d7107 M\u2299 ),\nexcluding the mass of Mrk 205 (outlier MBH = 44\u00d7107 M\u2299 ), and\nthe mean extracted from Table 5 of Blustin et al. (2005) (\u03bcm =\n2.7 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 ), excluding the mass of IRAS 13349+2438 (outlier\nMBH = 80 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 ). Also we take the larger value of the\nobserved dispersion \u03c3m (obs) = 1.3 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 .\n\n0e+00\n\nvout (km/s)\n\nRadial flows\nRandom l\u2212o\u2212s\n\n1000\n\nRadial flows\nRandom l\u2212o\u2212s\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nSet 2\n\n500\n\nNow we have the basic ingredient of the model, and we\nare ready to build our two classes of outflows.\nset 1: High-velocity. This synthetic sample is composed\nfrom 1000 black holes with masses normally distributed\nwith mean, \u03bcm = 2.6 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 and standard deviation,\n\u03c3m = 1.3 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 4 . Also we use a normal distribution\nfor the outflow velocity of the absorbing gas around the BH\nwith \u03bcv = 57, 000 km s\u22121 (this is the best-fit value for set 1),\nand \u03c3v = 15, 000 km s\u22121 .\nset 2: Low-velocity. In this case we use 1000 black holes\nwith masses normally distributed with the same mean, \u03bcm =\n2.6 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 and standard deviation, \u03c3m = 1.3 \u00d7 107 M\u2299\nas before but we use a normal distribution for the outflow\nvelocity of the absorbing gas around the BH with \u03bcv = 1800\nkm s\u22121 (this is the best-fit value for set 2), and \u03c3v = 600\nkm s\u22121 .\nThe best-fit values of \u03bcv (1) and \u03bcv (2) (as well \u0393f (1) =\n250 and \u0393f (2) = 40, see next section), are estimated by comparing a grid of models computed using 10, 000 6 \u03bcv (1) 6\n70, 000 (km s\u22121 ) and 100 6 \u03bcv (2) 6 2000 (km s\u22121 ), with\nthe corresponding set of observation: set 3 vs Tombesi et al.\n(2011) and set 4 vs Blustin et al. (2005). We performed\nthe comparison using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We take\nthe \u03bcv (1) and \u03bcv (2) (as well \u0393f (1) = 250 and \u0393f (2) = 40,\nsee next section) which give maximum p-values of the test.\nThe final p-value for the comparison set 3 vs Tombesi et al.\n(2011) gives \u2248 0.8 (D = 0.16) and for the set 4 vs\nBlustin et al. (2005) \u2248 0.07 (D = 0.38).\nThe launching radius Rin , for each set of simulations is\nbased on the results of Blustin et al. (2005) for set 2; i.e.,\nRin (set 2) = 1 pc (orders of magnitude value). For set 1, we\nset Rin (set 1) = 0.01 pc, based on Tombesi et al.

Velocity of the outflow vs the bolometric luminosity needed to accelerate the wind. Filled circles are the velocities\nobserved if we see the wind along the flow. Open squares are\nincluding the effects of random line-of-sights (see text for discussion).\n\nwe are observing all the objects radially along the flow. To\ninclude the effect of observing random line-of-sights transversely through different sections of the flow we connect the\nobserved velocity vobs with the intrinsic radial velocity, i.e.\nvobs = vout cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the outflow\ndirection and the line of sight. Then using the same luminosities produced by set 2, but plotting (open squares) against\n1000 vobs (s) randomly computed using a random generator\nof numbers (with \u03c0/12 6 \u03b8 6 \u03c0/2) 5 , and equation 2 with\nvobs = vout cos \u03b8, we produce the sub-sample set 4. It is easy\nto see that set 4, resembles better the plot shown in Figure\n4 of Blustin et al. (2005), taking into account the possible\nincompleteness of the sample.\nDoing the same for the UFOs, we use the luminosities\nproduced by set 1 (\u0393f = 250, this is the best-fit value for\nset 1 and set 3, see section 3) but plotting (open squares)\nagainst 1000 vobs (s) randomly computed using a random\ngenerator of numbers (with \u03c0/12 6 \u03b8 6 \u03c0/2), and equation\n2 with vobs = vout cos \u03b8, to produce the sub-sample set 3.\nIn this case set 3, better resembles the relationship between\nvout and luminosity (see Figure 2).\nIn Figure 2 we place both classes of outflows together\nalong with observational points taken from two samples\nof objects: 14 points out of the 23 objects reported by\nBlustin et al. (2005) (the others either did not report outflow velocity or were unknown), in the right panel; and 19\npoints from the sample of 19 objects were UFOs have been\ndetected by Tombesi et al. (2011), in the left panel.\nThere are several interesting facts about the plot: (1)\nthe observational points cover \u2248 3.8 orders of magnitude in\nvelocity; (2) they cover \u2248 3 orders of magnitude in bolometric luminosity (from \u223c 1043 \u2212 1046 erg/s); and (3) that\nour proposed model is able to reproduce most of the lowvelocity points (11/14) (two of the points might fall in the\nhigh-velocity set instead) and, less stringently, half of the\npoints for the high-velocity set (11/19), using one physical acceleration mechanism and three free parameters: mass\n5\n\nThe lower limit assumes that the torus cover \u223c 30 degrees, so\nwe are able to observe the outflow only from \u03b8 > \u03c0/12.\n\n\f1e+05\n\n2000\n\nRam\u0131\u0301rez and Tombesi\n\n4\n\nBlustin et al. 2005\nSet 4\n\n1000\n500\n\nvobs (km/s)\n\n6e+04\n2e+04\n\nvobs (km/s)\n\n1500\n\nTombesi et al. 2011\nSet 3\n\n5\n\n0.0e+00\n\n1.0e+46\nLbol (erg/s)\n\n2.0e+46\n\n0.0e+00\n\n1.0e+46\nLbol (erg/s)\n\nFigure 2.

Ellipses (1,2 and 3 \u03c3 contours of the model) are theoretical calculations coming from two samples of outflows; Left\npanel: high-velocity (set 3, i.e., including the effects of random\nline-of-sights), and Right panel: low-velocity (set 4, i.e., including the effects of random line-of-sights).

On the other hand, there are two sectors where\nthe deviations between model and theory are large: (1) the\nhigh-velocity/low luminosity; and (2) the low-velocity/high\nluminosity, both requiring a closer inspection to the completeness of the samples, and/or the addition of other acceleration mechanisms, like magnetic thrust for instance. But,\nthis may be the topic of future work.\n4.1\n\nescape radius at r \u223c (20 \u2212 100)rS (Schwarzschild radius,\nBH\nrS = 2GM\n). This is very close to the SMBH, and the\nc2\norigin is likely the accretion disk.\nAgain, using 500 \u2212 1500 km s\u22121 , as escape velocity from\na 2.6 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 BH, locates the gas at \u223c 0.1 \u2212 1 pc, well\nbeyond the event horizon of the BH, and the broad line\nregion (BLR; Laor & Draine 1993) as well, where the dusty\ntorus is thought to be located.\n\nAnisotropic radiation pressure picture\n\nWe propose here that the low- and high-velocity outflows\ncan be accelerated by the same physical mechanism (as is\nsuggested by Figure 2); i.e., radiation pressure, and that\nthe differences depend on the values of the 3 fundamental\nparameters: mass of the BH (MBH ), the object luminosity\n(Lbol ) and force multiplier (\u0393f ). The values of \u0393f we have\nused are of the orders of those found in observational (e.g.,\nLaor & Brandt 2002) and theoretical (e.g., Saez et al. 2011)\nworks. However, detailed photoionization computations are\nrequired to verify if the opacity of the gas under the physical\nconditions presented here can overcome the over-ionization\nproblem (Proga et al. 2000), and are left for future work.\nThe anisotropic property of the radiation is basically demanded by the existence of obscured and un-obscured (Type\n1 and Type 2) AGNs (Antonucci 1993), and it explains the\ndecreasing of Type 2 AGNs as a function of the X-ray Luminosity (Hasinger 2008). It is also intrinsically linked to\nthe existence of the dusty torus 6 and it gives the natural frame to locate our two classes of outflows. If comparable with the escape velocity of the system (a black hole of\nMBH = 5.3 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 ), fast-outflow, vout \u223c 0.10c, locates\n\nSUMMARY\n\nFor the first time, an exploration on the relationship between\nbolometric luminosity and outflow velocity, for two classes of\nX-ray outflows in a large sample of active galactic nuclei has\nbeen performed. We find that: (1) Line radiation pressure\nis an efficient 7 mechanism to accelerate the low-velocity\n(500 \u2212 2000 km s\u22121 ) gas we observe in the classical \u223c 1000\nkm s\u22121 warm absorber. (2) It might also become efficient\nto accelerate the high-velocity (0.05 \u2212 0.3c) gas we observe\nin the UFOs. (3) They both might be placed in the same\ncontext of anisotropic radiation pressure (e.g., Proga et al.\n2000; Proga & Kallman 2004; Liu & Zhang 2011).\nHowever, there are many open questions, which will require close investigation and detailed modeling. In the first\nplace the fact that we are assigning one type of outflow to\ndifferent portions of the parameter space (MBH , Lbol and\n\u0393f ), does not preclude the existence of both in the same\nobject. Also, careful studies of the connection between these\noutflows observed in X-rays and outflows seen in other bands\nof the electromagnetic spectrum, UV, infrared or optical\n(multi-wavelength studies) are important points to be addressed. Finally the close inspection of the main parameters\nof the system (MBH , vout and \u0393f ) with cosmological parameters (like redshift) is of high relevance, and might be the\ntopic of future works.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nJMR would like to thank T.
