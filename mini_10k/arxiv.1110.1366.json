We predict the\ndifferential scattering rate and annual modulation of the iDM signal which can be testable at future\nGermanium- and Xenon-based detectors.\n\nIntroduction \u2013 A plethora of cosmological observations\nhave clearly established the existence of a dark matter\n(DM) component to the matter budget of the Universe,\nwhich is about five times that of the visible matter contribution. The mass and interaction properties of the\nDM are however not known, and experimental efforts are\nunder way to detect it via its scattering against different\nkinds of nuclei, which will not only provide additional\ndirect evidence for its existence, but will also reveal the\ndetailed nature of its interaction with matter. Since no\nparticle in the Standard Model (SM) can play the role\nof DM, this will also be a sensitive probe of physics beyond SM and supplement the new physics search at Large\nHadron Collider (LHC). Supersymmetric extensions of\nSM provide one class of such models with several natural candidates for DM (e.g. neutralino, gravitino, etc)\nwhen R-parity symmetry is assumed. However, if the\nDM mass turns out to be in the few GeV range, as suggested by some recent experiments [1], the minimal version (MSSM) may need to be extended to accommodate\nthis, mainly due to its inability to reproduce the observed\nDM relic density [2].\nAnother reason for considering extensions of MSSM\nis to explain small neutrino masses. It would be interesting to see if the same extensions can also provide a\nnew DM candidate and determine its properties. Simple\nways to understand the smallness of neutrino masses are\nby adding one or more heavy SM singlet fermions to the\nMSSM . In these cases, the superpartner(s) of the singlet neutrino(s) with a small admixture of the left sneutrino can play the role of DM. In this paper, we focus\non the supersymmetric inverse seesaw models [3] where\none adds two SM singlet fermions N and S. In these\nmodels, there are three lepton number carrying electrically neutral fermions per family, namely (\u03bd, N, S). The\nDM particle is the lightest super-partner (LSP) of the\n\nmodel which can be a linear combination of the superpartners of (\u03bd, N, S) [4\u20137]. Current literature on the subject discusses two classes of such models. In the first\nclass, inverse seesaw is considered within the framework\nof MSSM [4]; however, in these models, one needs to\nomit terms in the superpotential that are allowed by\nthe symmetries of the Lagrangian. The second class\nof inverse seesaw DM models extend the gauge symmetry to SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y \u00d7 U (1)B\u2212L so that the inverse\nseesaw mass matrix arises from a B \u2212 L gauge symmetry [5]. However, the B \u2212 L gauge symmetry discussed\nin Ref. [5] does not arise from a grand unified theory\n(GUT). Yet, a third class uses global B \u2212 L symmetry to\nrestrict the inverse seesaw matrix to the desired form [6].\nIn this letter, we extend the MSSM gauge group to\nthe supersymmetric Left-Right (SUSYLR) gauge group\nSU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R \u00d7 U (1)B\u2212L so that not only does the\ninverse seesaw matrix arise naturally but, as was shown\nin Ref. [8], this model can emerge as a TeV scale theory\nfrom SO(10) GUT implying different dynamical properties of the DM particle than the previous woks.\nWorking within this new class of models, we find the\nfollowing results: (i) A linear combination of the superpartners of the new SM singlet fermions can be the LSP\nwith mass from a few GeV up to about 100 GeV without\nrunning into conflict with known low energy observations.\n(ii) The S-fermion, which is given a small lepton number violating mass to understand small neutrino masses,\nleads to a splitting of the above complex scalar LSP into\ntwo closely-spaced real scalar fields, the lighter of which\n(we'll denote it by \u03c71 ) is the true DM field and is accompanied by its slightly heavier partner field (\u03c72 ) with\na mass difference of order keVs. A consequence of this is\nthat the direct detection process involves a dominantly\ninelastic scattering mode with the nucleus (N ) where\n\u03c71 + N (A, Z) \u2192 \u03c72 + N (A, Z) [9], and can therefore be\n\n\f2\ntested in direct DM detection experiments [10]. The inelastic property arises naturally since the gauge Noether\ncurrent coupling to the Z (and Z \u2032 in models with extended gauge symmetries) necessarily connects \u03c71 to \u03c72 ;\nalso, any possible elastic contribution (mostly through\nthe Higgs mediation) is highly suppressed due to small\nYukawa couplings to light quarks. We believe this is an\nimportant point which has not been properly emphasized\nin earlier papers. (iii) The new TeV scale gauge dynamics in these models leads to new annihilation mechanisms\nfor DM in the early Universe responsible for its current\nrelic density.\nGeneral Structure of Supersymmetric Inverse seesaw \u2013\nThe inverse seesaw model [3] for neutrino masses uses the\nfollowing mass matrix involving the (\u03bd, N, S) fields:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nT\n0\nMD\n0\n0\nMR \uf8f8 ,\nMinv = \uf8ed MD\n(1)\nT\n0\nMR \u03bcS /2\n\nwhere we have suppressed the family index.\nThis leads to the \u0001 neutrino mass formula\nT\nM\u03bd = MD MR\u22121 \u03bcS MD MR\u22121 . Here the smallness\nof the neutrino masses arises from the small parameter\n\u03bcS , which for MR \u223c TeV and mD \u223c GeV, has a value\nin the keV range.\nNeglecting the keV-scale lepton number violation effect, the mass eigenstates are complex scalars in the basis\ne \u2020 , S),\ne and the lightest sneutrino eigenstate can be\nof (e\n\u03bd, N\nwritten as\n\u03c7\ne1 =\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\ne \u2020 + (U \u2020 )1Si Sei\n(U \u2020 )1\u03bdi \u03bdei + (U \u2020 )1Ni N\ni\n\n(2)\n\nwhere U is a 9 \u00d7 9 unitary matrix that diagonalizes the\nfull neutrino mass matrix given by Eq. (1). We note here\ne , Se sector of the sneutrino\nthat since the entries in the N\nmass matrix are \u223c TeV, to get an LSP in the GeV-range,\nwe do need some fine tuning; however, as shown in the\nnext section, we are able to get the right relic abundance\neven with such low-mass DM. Also, from universality arguments, the model requires the sneutrino LSP to be\nalways below \u223c 100 GeV, beyond which the lightest neutralino becomes the LSP.\nWhen lepton\nP number violation is invoked, the splitting terms 9m,n=1 Amn \u03c7\nem \u03c7\nen can be generated in the\nsneutrino sector (similar to those in Ref. [11]), and up to\nleading order in the lepton number violating mass term\n\u03bcS , the mass splitting of LSP can be written as\n\nMSUSY as in some region of parameter space in SUSYLR,\nthe splitting can be enhanced.\nThe mass matrix in Eq. (1) arises in the SUSYLR\nmodel [8], after symmetry breaking, from the superpotential\n1\nW = WMSSM + Y\u03bd L\u03a6Lc + YS S\u03c6R Lc + S\u03bcS S ,\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03a6 is a bi-doublet under SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R with\nB \u2212 L charge zero, and \u03c6R is a right-handed doublet\nwith a B \u2212 L = 1 responsible for B \u2212 L breaking.\nRelic Density \u2013 From Eq. (2), we see that the sneue \u2020 , S)\ne fields.\ntrino DM is a linear combination of the (e\n\u03bd, N\nTherefore, as shown in Fig. 1, its annihilation channels\ninvolve three major contributions, one from each component.

After invoking the lepton number violation\neffect, a mass splitting is generated between \u03c71 and \u03c72 , and\nthe interaction term can be rewritten as \u03bb2 h0 (\u03c721 + \u03c722 ) which\nis clearly an elastic interaction.\nThe direct detection channel conducted by gauge bosons\ncan be written as\ni\n2 cos \u03b8W\n\n\u0012\n\ncos2 \u03b8W\ng2R Z \u2032\u03bc\nc0 g2L Z \u03bc + c1 \u221a\ncos 2\u03b8W\n\n\u00d7 (\u03c7\ne1 \u2202\u03bc \u03c7\ne\u20201 \u2212 \u03c7\ne\u20201 \u2202\u03bc \u03c7\ne1 ),\n\n\u0013\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b8W is the Weinberg angle. After the lepton number\nviolation term is included, the interaction term is of the form\niZ \u03bc (\u03c71 \u2202\u03bc \u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72 \u2202\u03bc \u03c71 ). Therefore, the collisions between \u03c71\nand nucleus conducted by gauge bosons is inelastic.\nThe differential scattering rate of DM particle on target\nnucleus in direct detection experiment can be written as\ndR\n\u03c1\u03c7\n= 1\ndEr\nM\u03c7\n\nZ\n\nd3 v\n|v|>vmin\n\nA2eff \u03c3\u0304N 2\nF (|q|)f (v) ,\n2\u03bc\u03c7N |v|\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Er is the nuclear recoil energy, \u03c1\u03c71 is the local mass\ndensity of DM, M\u03c7 is the mass of the DM particle, \u03c3N is\nthe DM-nucleon cross section, and \u03bc\u03c7N is the reduced mass\nof DM and the target nucleus.\nP \u03c3\u0304 and Aeff are defined as\n\u03c3\u0304 = (\u03c3p + \u03c3n )/2 and Aeff = i\u2208isotopes 2ri [Z cos \u03b8N + (Ai \u2212\nZ) sin \u03b8N ]2 , where ri are relative abundances of isotopes, and\n\nvmin = \u221a\n\n1\n2MN Er\n\n\u0012\n\nMN Er\n+\u03b4\n\u03bc\u03c7N\n\n\u0013\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the mass gap, and \u03b4 = 0 corresponds to the case of\nelastic scattering.\nIn the case of elastic scattering conducted by Higgs, \u03c3N\nin Eq. (7) is the total scattering cross section which can be\nwritten as\nel\n\u03c3N\n\n=\n\n2\n\u03bb2 (MN\n\nP\n\nhN |mq q\u0304q|N i)\nq\n2\n4\u03c0vwk\nMh4 (MN + M\u03c7 )2\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhereas in the case of inelastic scattering, \u03c3N can be written\nas\nin\n\u03c3p,n\n\n\u0010\n\nMZ\n\u00d7\nMZ \u2032\n\n2\n4\nMp,n\nM\u03c721\ng2L\n\u03bap,n\n=\n4\n4\n4\u03c0 cos \u03b8W MZ (M\u03c71 + Mp,n )2\n\n\u00114\n\ncos12 \u03b8W\n+ 2c0 c1\ncos2 2\u03b8W\n\n\u0012\n\ng2R\ng2L\n\n\u00132 \u0010\n\n\"\n\nc20 + c21\n\nMZ\nMZ \u2032\n\n\u00112\n\n\u0012\n\ng2R\ng2L\n\ncos8 \u03b8W\ncos 2\u03b8W\n\n\u00134\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the first term in the bracket is induced by Z boson\nwhereas the second term is due to the Z \u2032 boson in SUSYLR\nand the last term is due to the interference\nbetween\n\u00012\n\u00012 the two.\nThe factors \u03bap = 43 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8W\nand \u03ban = 34\nare due\nto the different coupling of the vector bosons to proton and\nneutron respectively.\nIt is important to note here that for large fractions of the\n\u22123\nleft sneutrino component (c0 >\n\u223c 10 ), the scattering is mostly\u2032\ndominated by the Z-exchange, and is hence inelastic. The Z\ncontribution to the inelastic channel is always suppressed by\nits mass, and similarly, the elastic cross section is 4-5 orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the Z-dominated inelastic contribution because the coupling of the Higgs to nucleon is suppressed\n\u22124\nby light quark masses. However, for c0 <\n\u223c 10 and large c1 ,\nthe inelastic contribution, suppressed by the Z \u2032 -mass, could\nbecome comparable to the elastic counterpart. This is shown\nin Fig. 3, where we have plotted the cross section as a function of the DM mass for various values of c0 and c1 . One\ncan see that for small c0 and large c1 values (blue and orange\ncurves), the cross section is dominated by the elastic channel\n(thin lines) for low mass DM and by inelastic channel mediated by Z \u2032 for M\u03c7 >\n\u223c 10 GeV (thick lines), whereas for small\nor zero c1 component (pink and green curves), the scattering is always dominated by the inelastic channel mediated by\nZ. It is interesting to note here that the current XENON100\ndata constrains most of the parameter space of the model\nand for large c0 , puts an upper bound on the DM mass. This\ncan be seen clearly from Fig. 3 where we have shown the\nXENON100 limits on scattering cross section for various values of the mass gap, starting from zero on the left (red solid\ncurve, corresponding to the elastic case) to \u03b4 = 30, 60, 90\nand 120 keV cases.

The model prediction for the scattering cross section\nof the sneutrino DM off a nucleon as a function of its mass,\nfor various choices of the left and right sneutrino components.\nAlso shown are the XENON100 constraints for mass gap \u03b4 =\n(0, 30, 60, 90, 120) keV which were obtained by FeldmanCousins method [14] using the 100 days of live data [15].\nThe nuclear recoil energy in both elastic and inelastic scattering has a maximum determined by the escape velocity of\nDM in the local galaxy, and a minimum determined by the\nmass gap for inelastic case. Therefore, the topology of the differential scattering rate for inelastic scattering is very different\nfrom the elastic scattering, which can be used to determine\nwhether the DM is inelastic or not. Furthermore, for inelastic\nscattering, if the mass gap is comparable to the kinetic energy\nof DM, for certain nuclear recoil energy, due to Eq. (8), the\nrequired velocity is pushed to the tail end of the velocity distribution where the motion of the earth has a larger effect and\ntherefore the DM annual modulation signal gets enhanced.\nThe predicted normalized differential scattering rate and\nannual modulation for Germanium- and Xenon-based detectors are shown in Fig. 4 with different choices for parameters of the SUSYLR model. The mass of Z \u2032 is taken to\nbe 1 TeV in both cases. The red and blue curves are for\n(c0 , c1 ) = (0.001, 0.1) and (c0 , c1 ) = (0.1, 0.001), corresponding to the Z \u2032 and Z dominance, respectively, in the inelastic\nscattering between DM and target nucleus. The latter case is\nsimilar to the MSSM version of inverse seesaw. To translate\nthe differential rates to experimental quantities, namely the\nelectron equivalent recoil energies in germanium detector and\nthe S1 signal in xenon detector, we have used the quenching factor and scintillation efficiencies from CoGeNT [17] and\nXENON100 [15] experiments respectively. One can see from\nthe first two plots in Fig. 4 that a peak shows up if the scattering is dominated by inelastic interactions. Furthermore,\none can see from the third and fourth plots that for inelastic\ncase, the annual modulation can be larger than 100% in some\n\n30\n\n40\n\nS1\nNormalized Scattering modulation\n\n10\n\n-42\nNormalized Scattering modulation\n\nkeVee\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nS1\n\nFIG. 4. The model prediction for differential scattering rates\n(normalized to one) and annual modulations for germanium\nand xenon detectors. The upper two plots show the normalized scattering rate for germanium (left) and xenon (right)\ndetectors. The lower two plots show the annual modulation\nin the same detectors. Red and blue curves are for (c0 , c1 ) =\n(0.001, 0.1) and (c0 , c1 ) = (0.1, 0.001), respectively, while the\nsolid and dashed curves are for (M\u03c7 , \u03b4) = (10GeV, 20keV)\nand (50GeV, 60keV), respectively.\nWe note here that it is also possible to explain the recent\nCRESST-II data for an iDM with mass splitting O(100) keV,\nconsistent with the null results from XENON100 [19]. However, it is difficult to do so for DAMA/LIBRA, even though\nthere still exists a narrow iDM parameter space that does fit\nDAMA/LIBRA data with CRESST-II [20]. For this reason,\nwe did not include the DAMA/LIBRA results in our discussion on annual modulation.\nComments \u2013 As noted earlier, there exists a domain in the\nparameter space for which the dominant annihilation channel\nof the DM is to lepton-anti-lepton final states. The relative\nbranching fractions depend on the masses of the RH neutrinos\nand are somewhat model-dependent. If we take the model in\nRef. [8] as a guide, we expect them to be of similar order.\nThese dominantly-leptonic annihilation modes can, in principle, be important in understanding signals from the galactic\ncenter, radio filaments as well as WMAP haze [21]; however,\nwe expect these effects to be suppressed in our model due to\nthe p-wave nature of the dominant DM annihilation channels.\nFurthermore, we observe that there exist upper limits on\nthe direct DM detection cross section from monojet plus missing energy searches in colliders [22]. However, for light spin\nzero dark matter only weakly interacting with the nucleons,\nthe collider limits on the spin-independent cross sections are\nweaker than the direct search bounds.\nAlso, depending on the sparticle spectrum prediction of\n\n\f5\nthe model, the sneutrino LSP can have distinctive collider\nsignatures. In particular, if the gluino is lighter (heavier)\nthan the squarks, the sneutrino LSP can have interesting four\n(two) jet+like (opposite)-sign dilepton signals with missing\nenergy [23]. A detailed collider simulation of these events for\nour model will be given elsewhere [24].\nConclusion \u2013 To summarize, we have shown that the supersymmetric inverse seesaw model for neutrinos naturally\nleads to an inelastic scalar DM. The differential scattering\nrate and annual modulation predicted in these models might\nbe tested in future direct detection experiments. The DM particle mass is found to be strongly constrained by the current\nXENON bounds, and for keV-scale mass splitting for the real\nscalar LSP states (as required by neutrino mass constraints),\nwe find an upper limit of around 20 GeV on the DM mass.\nThis is consistent with the model prediction for the sneutrino\nLSP mass which is required to be below \u223c 100 GeV from\nuniversality arguments.\nTherefore, we might be able to identify SUSY inverse seesaw if from the collider search, we can confirm that the sneutrino is a long-lived particle, and from direct detection experiments, we observe an inelastic WIMP from the differential\nscattering rate and the annual modulation.\nAcknowledgment \u2013 H.
