Introduction\nMaximizing the superconducting critical current is a major goal of applied\nsuperconductivity research. While much attention has been focused on Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+\u03b4\nwire technology, it is now becoming apparent that large superconducting critical current\ndensities, Jc, can be achieved in YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin-film coated conductors (>200 A/cm-1width at 77K [1]). The high superconducting critical currents are clearly due to an\nimprovement in the type and distribution of pinning centres as well as epitaxy and the\nstronger c-axis coupling. Some studies have also shown that the oxygen content and hole\nconcentration are important parameters for achieving the highest critical currents in the high\ntemperature superconducting cuprates (HTSC's) [2-5]. In one study it was shown that Jc and\nthe irreversibility temperature from a c-axis aligned Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 powder sample\nreaches a peak in the overdoped side of the superconducting phase diagram and near a hole\nconcentration, p , of ~ 0.19 holes per Cu [2,3]. It has been argued that p ~0.19 is the location\nof a quantum critical point [3] where the normal-state pseudogap closes [6] and the\nsuperconducting condensate density is maximized [2,3,7]. It is therefore of technical interest\nto investigate the hole concentration dependence of Jc in Y1-xCaxBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4.\nIn this paper we report the results from measurements of Jc on YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 and\nY0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin films. The sample without Ca has a superconducting transition\ntemperature, Tc, of greater than 90 K, but it can only be moderately overdoped ( p \u2264 0.187).\nHowever, Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 can be oxygen loaded to a higher hole concentration, although\nthe hole concentrations achieved in Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin films are significantly less than\nthat from bulk Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4. We have also measured the irreversibility field in bulk\nY0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4.\n2. Experimental details\nA YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin film was prepared on a SrTiO3 substrate using the sol-gel method\ndescribed in detail elsewhere [8]. It was prepared by thermal decomposition of a spin-coated\nsol-gel precursor. The precursor is a simple metal-organic structure, based on a mixed metal\ncomplex of yttrium, barium and copper with malic acid, formed through ligand exchange with\nacetate starting materials. The malate complex is then further reacted with glycerol to form a\npolyester incorporating the YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 cations. Malic acid is both an excellent metal binder,\nkeeping all three species soluble in solution, and also promotes polymer formation. An\nintimate mixture of the cations is produced, which is shown thermogravimetrically to break\ndown in a single step, depositing the cations together. This avoids the formation of crystallites\nof any suboxide species in the film. The YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 phase was formed by heating for 2\nhours at 770 \u00b0C with an oxygen partial pressure of 4\u00d710-4 bar. Oxygen loading occurred\nduring the cool-down in a 100 % oxygen atmosphere. X-ray diffraction measurements\nconfirmed that the YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 film was orientated with the c-axis perpendicular to the\nsubstrate surface. The film thickness was estimated from scanning electron microscope\nmeasurements to be 230 nm.\nThe Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4, thin film was also prepared on a SrTiO3 substrate by pulsed\nlaser deposition (PLD) using a Lambda Physik LPX210 KrF laser with a wavelength of 248\nnm, as described in detail elsewhere [9]. The films were grown at 800 \u00b0C and a pressure of\nless than 1.2 mbar. The film thickness was estimated from atomic force microscope\nmeasurements to be 250 nm. X-ray diffraction measurements indicated that the\nY0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 film was orientated with the c-axis perpendicular to the substrate surface.\nA Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 bulk ceramic sample was made from the respective nitrates and\noxides as described elsewhere [10]. The final sintering was at 950 \u00b0C in oxygen for 16 hours.\n\n\f3\n\nThe sample was then removed from the hot zone of the furnace but still within the flowing\noxygen. It was then reinserted when the furnace had reached 600 \u00b0C. The sample was held at\nthis temperature for 12 hours and then ramped at a rate of 0.2 \u00b0C/minute to 350 \u00b0C, followed\nby an anneal for 24 hours at 350 \u00b0C and ramped at 2 \u00b0C/minute to room temperature. This\nannealing regime is necessary to achieve maximum oxygentaion and hence maximum\noverdoping.\nAll the samples were annealed at various temperatures and oxygen partial pressures to\nalter the oxygen content and hence the hole concentration in the CuO2 planes. Unfortunately,\nthe absolute oxygen content is difficult to measure in thin films. However, it is possible to\nindirectly infer changes in the oxygen content from the c-axis lattice parameter, because the caxis lattice parameter is known to systematically increase with increasing \u03b4 from\nmeasurements on bulk YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 [11]. For this reason, the c-axis lattice parameter was\nmeasured from the x-ray diffraction data to determine if each annealing leads to an increase or\ndecrease in \u03b4.\nThe superconducting transition temperature and Jc were measured using a vibrating\nsample magnetometer. An applied magnetic field of 0.5 mT was used for measuring Tc and Jc\nwas measured for magnetic fields of up to 1 T and with the applied magnetic field\nperpendicular to the surface of the film. Irreversibility measurements were made on the bulk\nceramic Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 sample using a SQUID magnetometer and applied magnetic\nfields of up to 6 T by performing zero-field-cooled and field-cooled measurements.\n3. Results and Discussion\nThe magnetic field dependence of Jc from the as-made YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin film\n(Tc=90.8 K) can be seen in figure 1 for various temperatures, T . It was calculated from the\nmagnetization loops using the method of Angadi et al. [12]. In this case Jc is given by,\nJC =\n\n3\u03c0\nm\u221e\n2\u0398t (dm/ dH)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere t is the thickness of the film, m\u221e is the difference in the moment value at a given field\nHx in the reverse and forward cycles of the loop, dm / dH represents the initial slope of the\nreverse leg of the hysteresis loop at the field Hx and \u0398 is given by ln(8R/t \u2013 1\u20442) where R\nrepresents the radius of the supercurrent loop and it is calculated from the initial slope of the\nloop using the equation dm / dH = \u2212\u03c0 2 R 3 / \u0398 .\nIt can be seen in figure 1 that the field-dependence of Jc follows a power law, which\nindicates a weak-link regime for magnetic fields between 0.05 T and 1 T [13]. The data was\nfitted to J c = ( B / B0 ) \u2212 n1 and the results are shown by the solid curves in figure 1. We find that\nthe exponent is 0.51 for T \u2264 61 K and it has increased to 0.58 for T = 72 K. The coefficient for\ntemperatures approaching Tc is close to that reported from studies on bi-crystal YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4\nthin films [14]. However, the smaller exponent below ~61 K indicates a weaker dependence\nof Jc on the applied magnetic field at low temperatures.\nThe temperature-dependence of Jc can be seen in figure 2 for the YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 film\nthat was annealed to change the oxygen content. Jc was calculated from the magnetization\nloops using the method of Brandt and Indenbom [15]. X-ray diffraction measurements\nshowed that the sample with a Tc of 92.5 K had a larger c-axis and hence \u03b4 than the as-made\nsample, where the increase in Tc indicates that the as-made sample is overdoped ( p >0.16).\nStudies on other YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin films have found that Jc can be fitted to a power law\ntemperature-dependence. For this reason, Jc was fitted to J c = J c ,0 (1 \u2212 T / Tc ) n 2 and the resultant\n\n\f4\n\nfitted curves are plotted in figure 2 (solid curves). The as-made sample shows a departure\nfrom this relation for reduced temperatures, \u03c4 = (1 \u2212 T / Tc ) , of less than ~0.5 and hence the data\nwere only fitted above this. The resultant exponent, n2 , is 1.05 for Tc values of 90.8 K and\n92.5 K. However, in the underdoped region there is an increase in n2 to 1.52 for Tc=86K and\n1.65 for Tc=73.9 K. A crossover from quasilinear to a concave temperature-dependence has\nalso been reported from measurements on a YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin film made by pulsed laser\ndeposition [4]. It has been suggested that this crossover arises from a change in the nature and\ndistribution of the intergrain weak-links in the underdoped region [16].\nThe effect of hole concentration on Jc can be seen in figure 3 (right axis), where Jc is\nplotted at 15 K (filled circles) and \u03c4=0.2 (crosses) as a function of hole concentration. The\nhole concentration was estimated from Tc using the empirical Tc( p ) found in the HTSC's\n[17]. It is written as Tc ( p) = Tc , Max [1 \u2212 82.6( p \u2212 0.16) 2 ] and is plotted in figure 3 (solid curve and\nleft axis). There is a clear increase in Jc with increasing p and it is largest for overdoped\nYBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4. The increase in the low-temperature Jc may arise from a corresponding increase\nin U (0)\u03be ab (0) [2,5], where U (0) is the condensate energy and \u03be ab (0) is the superconducting\ncoherence length at T = 0K. It has been shown that if Jc is dominated at low temperatures by\npinning then it is proportional to U (0)\u03be ab (0) [2,5] and from studies on Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4,\nU (0)\u03be ab (0) maximizes in the overdoped region at p ~0.2 [5].\nIt is not possible to probe the very overdoped region of the superconducting phase\ndiagram ( p >0.19) using YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 and hence we also studied a Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin\nfilm where hole-doping by Ca extends the doping range. The resultant temperaturedependence of Jc can be seen in figure 4. Oxygen annealing the as-made sample decreases Tc\nand hence increases the hole-concentration. The low temperature Jc reaches a maximum of\n~13 MA/cm2, which is greater than that observed in the YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin film, and it is\nessentially the same for oxygen annealing at 350 \u00b0C, 600 \u00b0C and 650 \u00b0C followed by cooling\nat 2\u00b0C/minute to room temperature. We suspect that the relatively fast cooling rate is still\ninsufficiently fast to avoid oxygenation on the cooldown, with the result that there is little\ndifference in Tc and Jc. Doping may be better achieved by quenching or sealing in quartz\ntubes with an appropriate oxygen getter. The minimum Tc in the overdoped region (74.5 K) is\nsignificantly greater than that achievable in bulk ceramic Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 (45 K [10])\nprocessed using a final high temperature oxygen anneal followed by oxygen loading at a\nlower temperature. It is not known why this additional processing step leads to a significant\nincrease in the hole concentration.\nJc was also fitted to J c = J c ,0 (1 \u2212 T / Tc ) n 2 (solid curves) and the resultant n2 is 2.54,\n2.16, 1.96 and 1.77 for the as-made sample, and after annealing at 350 \u00b0C, 600 \u00b0C and 650 \u00b0C,\nrespectively. These values are larger than those observed in the YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin film in the\noptimally and lightly overdoped region. The concave temperature-dependence may suggest\nthat a further increase in Jc could be possible if the effect of the weak-links is reduced, leading\nto a value of n2 closer to that observed in fully loaded YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4. We note that significant\nchanges can be seen in Jc for \u03c4<0.6 where Jc systematically increases with increasing\nannealing temperature. Since the associated changes in Tc are small, it is possible that these\nchanges may be due to a decrease in the weak-link behaviour.\nWe show in figure 3 the low-temperature Jc against hole concentration for the\nY0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin film (open circles). To enable a comparison with the YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4\nthin film, the Jc values are scaled by a factor of 0.54. The plot suggests that Jc is largest in the\noverdoped region where U (0)\u03be ab (0) is maximized.\n\n\f5\n\nAs mentioned above, the very overdoped region cannot be accessed with\nY0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin films. Therefore, to probe the very overdoped region, we performed\nirreversibility measurements on a bulk Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 ceramic sample. While there are a\nnumber of interpretations of the irreversibility field, Birr, it is believed that large irreversibility\nfields are correlated with large critical currents. Birr can be written as Birr = Birr (0)[1 \u2212 T / Tc ]n3\nfor temperatures near Tc where n3 =1.5 for flux creep or flux-line melting [18,19] and n3 =2.0\nfor a 3D to 2D flux-line transition [19]. However, these exponents can be larger when a\ntemperature-dependent penetration depth anisotropy is included [20].\nThe irreversibility field from the bulk Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 ceramic sample is plotted in\nfigure 5 for the as-made sample (filled circles, Tc=52 K, p =0.231) and then after annealing at\ndifferent temperatures and oxygen partial pressures. Each annealing was followed by\nquenching in liquid nitrogen. The data in figure 5 were fitted to Birr = Birr (0)[1 \u2212 T / Tc ]n3 (solid\ncurves) and the resultant values of ( Birr (0), n3 ) are (105 T, 1.85), (43 T, 2.08), (31 T, 2.41) and\n(12 T, 2.60) for Tc=52 K, 81 K, 85 K and 73 K respectively. The last sample is underdoped.\nThe value of n3 from the very overdoped sample with Tc=52 K ( p =0.231) is slightly larger\nthan that reported in a study on c-axis aligned and sintered ceramic YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 ( n3 =1.7 [5])\nsamples over a similar reduced temperature range and with \u03b4 \u2264 0.2. We note that it has been\nreported that samples with larger values of \u03b4 are better described by a 3D to 2D flux-line\ntransition and hence n3 is expected to be larger for more underdoped YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 [21].\nOur measurements on bulk Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 show a clear increase in Birr (0) that is\nstill increasing even for hole concentrations of up to 0.231. An increase in Birr (0) was also\nobserved in Bi2-xPbxSr2Ca2Cu3O10+\u03b4 ceramic samples up to the maximum achievable hole\nconcentration ( p ~0.17) [20]. It was predicted that Birr (0) in Bi2Sr2CaCu3O8 and\nBi2-xPbxSr2Ca2Cu3O10+\u03b4 maximizes at p ~0.21 [20]. This was based on the competing roles of\n\u03bb\u2212ab2 (0) , which maximises at p ~ 0.19 and \u03bb\u2212c2 (0) , which increases monotonically with doping\nacross the entire phase diagram. The current study on Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 shows that Birr (0)\nis still increasing for hole concentrations greater than 0.21 and this presumably reflects the\nstronger doping dependence of \u03bb\u2212c2 in this compound.\nThe irreversibility temperature at a fixed field is plotted in the inset to figure 5 from\nthe bulk Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 ceramic sample at 4 T. Data are also included for a sample\nannealed at 600 \u00b0C and then slowly cooled to room temperature (overdoped and Tc=70 K). As\nnoted in a previous study on a c-axis aligned powder sample in resin [3], the irreversibility\ntemperature maximizes in the overdoped region.\n4. Conclusion\nCritical current measurements on a YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin film made using a sol-gel\nmethod displays a field-dependence for the c-axis parallel to the applied magnetic field and\ntemperatures near Tc that is similar to that seen in other YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin films. For\ntemperatures far below Tc, the critical current is a more slowly varying function of applied\nmagnetic field for magnetic fields in the region of 0.05 T to 1 T. Jc is also observed to\nincrease with increasing hole concentration. The results suggest that the maximum Jc should\noccur for fully-loaded and overdoped thin films.\nMeasurements of Jc on a overdoped Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin film made by pulsed\nlaser deposition show a higher Jc at low temperatures. However, for this film Jc for\ntemperatures closer to Tc is strongly dependent on the oxygen loading conditions.\nIrreversibility measurements on a more overdoped bulk Y0.8Ca0.2Ba2Cu3O7-\u03b4 ceramic sample\n\n\f6\n\nshows that Birr(0) is still increasing for hole concentrations as high as ~0.23. When the data\nare plotted as the irreversibility temperature at a fixed field, the irreversibility temperature is\nfound to maximize in the overdoped region as noted in a previous study. The Jc measurements\non Y1-xCaxBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 thin films indicate that Jc is largest in the overdoped region where\nU (0)\u03be ab (0) is maximized.\nAcknowledgements\nAuthors thank Jeff Tallon for his suggestions.
