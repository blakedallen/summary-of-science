Introduction\nBrou\u00e9, Malle and Michel have shown that the automizer of an abelian Sylow p-subgroup P\nin a finite simple Chevalley group is an irreducible complex reflection group (for p not too small\nand different from the defining characteristic) [BrMaMi, BrMi].\nThe aim is this note is to show that a suitable version of this property holds for general finite\ngroups.\nWe give a simple direct proof, building on the Lehrer-Springer theory [LeSp], that the property above holds for simply connected simple algebraic groups G, provided p is not a torsion\nprime (Proposition 4.1): the automizer E = NG (P )/CG (P ) is a reflection group on \u03a91 (P ), the\nlargest elementary abelian subgroup of P .\nOn the other hand, we show that the presence of p-torsion in the Schur multiplier of a finite\ngroup G prevents the subgroup of E generated by reflections from being irreducible (Proposition\n3.5).\nThis suggests considering covering groups of finite simple groups or equivalently finite simple\ngroups G such that H 2 (G, Fp ) = 0. We also need to allow p\u2032 -automorphisms and we now look\nfor a description of the automizer as an extension of an irreducible reflection group W by a\nsubgroup of NGL(\u03a91 (P )) (W )/W .\nWe actually need a slight generalization: \u03a91 (P ) should be viewed in some cases as a vector\nspace over a larger finite field (for example in the case of PSL2 (Fpn )) and we need to allow field\nautomorphisms.\nAs an example, the automizer of an 11-Sylow subgroup in the Monster is the 2-dimensional\ncomplex reflection group G16 .\nI thank Richard Lyons and Geoff Robinson for useful discussions.\n2. Notation and definitions\nLet p be a prime. Given P an abelian group, we denote by \u03a91 (P ) the subgroup of P of\nelements of order 1 or p, i.e., the largest elementary abelian p-subgroup of P .\nLet V be a free module of finite rank over a commutative algebra K. A reflection is an\nelement s \u2208 GLK (V ) of finite order such that V / ker(s \u2212 1) is a free K-module of rank 1 (note\nthat we do not require s2 = 1). A finite subgroup of GLK (V ) is a reflection group if it is\ngenerated by reflections.\n3. Main result and remarks\nLet p be a prime and H a simple group such that the p-part of the Schur multiplier of H is\ntrivial, i.e. H 2 (H, Fp ) = 0. Assume H has an abelian Sylow p-subgroup P . Let H\u0303 \u2264 Aut(H)\n1\n\n\f2\n\nRAPHA\u00cbL ROUQUIER\n\nbe a finite group containing H and such that H\u0303/H is a Hall p\u2032 -subgroup of Out(H). Let\nE = NH\u0303 (P )/CH\u0303 (P ).\nTheorem 3.1. There is\n\u2022 a finite field K\n\u223c\n\u2022 an Fp -subspace V of \u03a91 (P ) and an isomorphism of Fp -vector spaces K \u2297Fp V \u2192 \u03a91 (P )\nendowing \u03a91 (P ) with a structure\nof K-vector space\n\u0001\n\u2022 a subgroup N of GLK \u03a91 (P ) and\n\u2022 a subgroup \u0393 of Aut(K)\n\u0001\nsuch that E = N \u22ca \u0393, as subgroups of Aut \u03a91 (P ) , and such that the normal subgroup W of\nN generated by reflections acts irreducibly on \u03a91 (P ).\nThe theorem will be proven in \u00a74.\nRemark 3.2. Gorenstein and Lyons have shown that NH (P )/CH (P ) acts irreducibly on \u03a91 (P )\nviewed as a vector space over Fp and, as a consequence, P is homocyclic [GoLy, (12.1)].\nNote nevertheless that the subgroup of NH (P )/CH (P ) generated by reflections might not be\nirreducible in its action on \u03a91 (P ): this happens for example in the case H = A2p , p > 3.\nWe can take K = Fp in Theorem 3.1, except for\n\u2022 PSL2 (pn ), n > 1: K = Fpn\n\u2022 J1 and 2 G2 (q), p = 2: K = F8 .\nIn those cases, V = Fp and P = \u03a91 (P ) = K.\nNote that the theorem is trivial when P is cyclic: one takes K = Fp and N = E = W \u2282 F\u00d7\np.\nUsing the classification of finite simple groups, we deduce a statement about finite groups\nwith abelian Sylow p-subgroups.\nCorollary 3.3. Let G be a finite group with an abelian Sylow p-subgroup P . Let H =\n\u2032\nO p (G/Op\u2032 (G)).\nAssume the p-part of the Schur multiplier of H is trivial. Then, there is a finite group X\ncontaining H as a normal subgroup of p\u2032 -index and\n\u2022 a product K of finite field extensions of Fp\n\u223c\n\u2022 an Fp -subspace V of \u03a91 (P ) and an isomorphism of Fp -vector spaces K \u2297Fp V \u2192 \u03a91 (P )\nendowing \u03a91 (P ) with a structure\nof a free K-module\n\u0001\n\u2022 a subgroup N of GLK \u03a91 (P ) and\n\u2022 a subgroup \u0393 of Aut(K)\n\u0001\nsuch that NX (P )/CX (P ) = N \u22ca \u0393, as subgroups of Aut \u03a91 (P ) , and such that denoting by W\nthe normal subgroup of N generated by reflections, we have \u03a91 (P )W = 1.\nProof. The case where H is simple is Theorem 3.1. In general, the classification of finite simple\ngroups shows that there are finite simple groups H1 , . . . , Hr such that H = H1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Hr (cf.\neg [FoHa, \u00a75]). Note that Op (H) = 1, i.e., there is no non-trivial p-group as a direct factor of\nH, since H 2 (H, Fp ) = 0. Now, we take X = X1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Xr , where the Xi are associated with\nHi . We put K = K1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Kr , etc.\n\u0003\nFollowing [GoLy, Proof of (12.1)], we give now the list of possible finite simple groups H\nand primes p such that Sylow p-subgroups of H are abelian non-cyclic and the p-part of the\n\n\fAUTOMIZERS AS EXTENDED REFLECTION GROUPS\n\n3\n\nSchur multiplier of H is trivial. In the first case, instead of providing the group H, we provide\na group G such that H \u2264 G/Op\u2032 (G) \u2264 Aut(H) and p6 | [G/Op\u2032 (G) : H].\n\u2022 G = GF where G is a simply connected simple algebraic group and F is an endomorphism of G, a power of which is a Frobenius endomorphism defining a rational structure\nover a finite field with q elements, p6 |q and p is not a torsion prime for G\n\u2022 H = An and n < p2\n\u2022 H = PSL2 (pn )\n\u2022 H = 2 G2 (q), p = 2\n\u2022 H is sporadic\nAssume K = Fp . We have V = \u03a91 (P ) and \u0393 = 1. Furthermore, N = E \u2282 NGL(P ) (W ). So,\nin this case, the theorem is equivalent to the statement that W acts irreducibly on P . As a\nconsequence, in order to show that the theorem holds, it is enough to prove the statement with\nH\u0303 replaced by a group G as above.\nRemark 3.4. The finite simple groups with an abelian Sylow p-subgroup such that the p-part\nof the Schur multiplier is non-trivial are the following (cf [Atl]):\n\u2022 H = M22 , ON, A6, A7 and p = 3\n\u2022 H = PSL2 (q), q \u2261 3, 5 (mod 8) and p = 2\n\u2022 H = PSL3 (q) and 3|q \u2212 1 or H = PSU3 (q) and 3|q + 1 (here p = 3)\nNote that the automizer of a Sylow 3-subgroup P in Aut(ON) = ON.2 does not contain any\nreflection (when P is viewed as a vector space over F3 ). That automizer is not a subgroup of\nGL2 (9).2 (extension by the Frobenius).\nNote that the presence of p-torsion in the Schur multiplier is an obstruction to the irreducibility of the subgroup of the automizer generated by reflections on \u03a91 (P ), viewed as a vector space\nover Fp .\nProposition 3.5. Let G be a finite group with an abelian Sylow p-subgroup P . Let E =\nNG (P )/CG (P ) and let W be the subgroup of E generated by reflections on \u03a91 (P ), viewed as an\nFp -vector space. Assume p > 2.\nIf H 2 (G, Fp ) 6= 0, then \u03a91 (P )W 6= 0.\nProof. Let V = \u03a91 (P )\u2217 . We have H 2 (G, Fp ) \u2243 H 2 (NG (P ), Fp ) \u2243 H 2 (P, Fp )E . On the other\n\u223c\nhand, we have an isomorphism of Fp E-modules H 2 (P, Fp ) \u2192 V \u2295 \u039b2 (V ), so H 2 (G, Fp ) \u2243\nV E \u2295 \u039b2 (V )E \u2282 V W \u2295 \u039b2 (V )W . By Solomon's Theorem [So], we have \u039b2 (V )W \u2243 \u039b2 (V W ). The\nresult follows.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.6. Let W be a reflection group on a complex vector space L, with minimal field of\ndefinition K. The subgroup of the outer automorphism group of W of elements fixing the set of\nreflections has always a decomposition as a semi-direct product (NGL(L) (W )/W ) \u22ca Gal(K/Q)\nas shown by Marin and Michel [MaMi].\nRemark 3.7. It would be interesting to investigate if there is a version of Theorem 3.1 for\nnon-principal blocks with abelian defect groups.\nIn a work in progress, we study automizers of maximal elementary abelian p-subgroups in\ncovering groups of simple groups.\n\n\f4\n\nRAPHA\u00cbL ROUQUIER\n\n4. Proof of Theorem 3.1\nWe run through the list of groups H (or G) as described above.\n4.1. Chevalley groups. Let G be a connected and simply connected reductive algebraic group\nover an algebraic closure k of a finite field and endowed with an endomorphism F , a power of\nwhich is a Frobenius endomorphism. Let G = GF . Assume p is invertible in k and p is not a\ntorsion prime for G.\n4.1.1. Abelian p-subgroups. Since p is not a torsion prime for G, every abelian p-subgroup Q\nof G is contained in an F -stable maximal torus T of G and L = CG (Q) is a Levi subgroup\n([SpSt, Corollary 5.10 and Theorem 5.8] and [GeHi, Proposition 2.1]). Furthermore, NG (Q) =\nNG (Q)CG (Q) [SpSt, Corollary 5.10], hence NG (Q)/CG (Q) = NG (Q)/CG (Q).\nLet W = NG (T)/T, X = Hom(T, Gm ) and Y = Hom(Gm , T). If G is simple, then the\naction of W on C \u2297Z X is irreducible.\nWe have a canonical map NW (Q) \u2192 NG (Q)/T. Since L \u2282 NG (Q) \u2282 NG (L), we obtain an\nisomorphism\n\u223c\nNW (Q)/CW (Q) \u2192 NG (Q)/CG (Q).\nGiven L an abelian group, we denote by Lp\u221e the subgroup of p-elements of L. Let \u03bc = k \u00d7 .\nWe have an isomorphism\n\u223c\n\nTp\u221e \u2192 Hom(X, \u03bcp\u221e ), t 7\u2192 (\u03c7 7\u2192 \u03c7(t)).\nThis provides an isomorphism\n\n\u223c\n\nTp\u221e \u2192 Y \u2297Z \u03bcp\u221e .\nThese isomorphisms are equivariant for the actions of W and F .\n4.1.2. Abelian Sylow p-subgroups. Assume now P = Q is a abelian Sylow p-subgroup of G. Let\nV = Y \u2297Z Fp . We have V F \u2243 \u03a91 (P ).\nProposition 4.1. The group NW (P )/CW (P ) is a reflection group on \u03a91 (P ). If G is simple,\nthen this reflection group is irreducible.\nProof. Note that NW (P )/CW (P ) is a p\u2032 -group, since P is an abelian Sylow p-subgroup of G\nand NW (P )/CW (P ) \u2243 NG (P )/CG (P ). So, the canonical map is an isomorphism\n\u223c\n\nNW (P )/CW (P ) \u2192 NW (\u03a91 (P ))/CW (\u03a91 (P )).\nThe proposition follows now from the next lemma by Lehrer-Springer theory [LeSp] extended\nto positive characteristic [Rou].\n\u0003\nLemma 4.2. We have dim V F \u2265 dim V wF for all w \u2208 W .\nProof. Let \u1e87 \u2208 NG (T). By Lang's Lemma, there is x \u2208 G such that \u1e87 = x\u22121 F (x). Given\nt \u2208 T, we have F (xtx\u22121 ) = x\u1e87F (t)\u1e87 \u22121 . So, xTx\u22121 is F -stable and the isomorphism\n\u223c\n\nT \u2192 xTx\u22121 , t 7\u2192 xtx\u22121\ntransfers the action of wF on the left to the action of F on the right. So,\n\u0001F\n\u0001\nV wF \u2243 Y (xTx\u22121 ) \u2297 Fp \u2243 \u03a91 (xTx\u22121 )F .\nThe rank of that elementary abelian p-subgroup of G is at most the rank of P and we are\ndone.\n\u0003\n\n\fAUTOMIZERS AS EXTENDED REFLECTION GROUPS\n\n5\n\n4.2. Alternating groups. Let G = Sn , n > 7. Put n = pr + s with 0 \u2264 s \u2264 p \u2212 1 and r < p.\nWe have P \u2243 (Z/p)r . We put K = Fp , N = W = F\u00d7\np \u2240 Sr .\nRemark 4.3. Note that when n = 5 and p = 2 or n = 6, 7 and p = 3, the p-part of the Schur\nmultiplier is not trivial but the description above is still valid. Note though that when n = 6\nand p = 3, then G contains S6 as a subgroup of index 2. We have K = F3 , P = K 2 , N = E,\nW is a Weyl group of type B2 and [N : W ] = 2.\n4.3. PSL2 .
