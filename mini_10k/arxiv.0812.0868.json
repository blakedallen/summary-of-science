It provides elegant explanation of several open\nquestions of SM in addition to providing a natural explanation for the smallness of neutrino\nmasses[6, 7, 8, 9] via see-saw mechanism [10, 11, 12, 13]. In [14, 15] the possibility that it be\nconsistent as a TeV scale extension of the SM was explored. In the supersymmetric setting\nit was shown by [16] that MR \u223c TeV is consistent with SO(10) at MX \u223c 1016 GeV. In this\npaper we adopt a similar approach viz., the scale of Left-Right symmetry can be at TeV to\nPeV scale, and that supersymmetry (SUSY) is preserved down to the same scale, so that\nthe TeV / PeV scale is protected from unreasonable corrections from higher energy scales1 .\nThe cosmological phase transition accompanying the parity breakdown is effectively a\nfirst order phase transition wherein domains of two different kinds of vacua separated by a\nnetwork of domain walls (DW) occur[20]. The need for ensuring a homogeneous Universe\nin late cosmology requires the phase transition to end appropriately, in particular that this\nnetwork of domain walls be unstable. The limits on the epoch to which the DW network\nmay survive are placed by the requirements of successful Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)\nand cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) data. A possible signature for a phase\ntransition ending with decay of domain walls at such energy scales is relic gravitational waves\ndetectable at upcoming experiments[21].\nThe unstable domain walls can have specific physical consequences. One of the possibilities is that they are very slow in disappearing. This is generically true if the difference\nin values of the effective potential across the wall is small. The energy density of the domain wall complex scales with the cosmological scale factor a as \u03c1 \u221d 1/a, resulting in\na(t) \u221d t2 leading to a mild inflationary behaviour. This accords with a proposal of thermal\ninflation[22] (in some contexts called weak inflation) which can help to dilute unwanted relics\narising in string theory[23][24].\nUnstable domain walls also provide the non-adiabatic conditions for leptogenesis. Theories with majorana neutrino masses and especially with gauged B \u2212 L symmetry present\nthe interesting possibility of explaining the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via thermal\n1\n\nFor reviews of supersymmetry see [17, 18, 19] and references therein.\n\n2\n\n\fprocesses in the early Universe[25]. This particular approach however has been shown to\ngenerically require the scale of majorana neutrino mass, equivalently, the scale of gauged\nB \u2212 L symmetry breaking in relevant models, to be 1011 -1013 GeV [26, 27], with a more\noptimistic constraint MB\u2212L > 109 GeV [28, 29]. On the other hand, it has been shown\n\n[30, 31] that the only real requirement imposed by Leptogenesis is that the presence of\nheavy neutrinos should not erase lepton asymmetry generated by a given mechanism, possibly non-thermal. This places the modest bound M1 > 104 GeV, on the mass of the lightest\nof the heavy majorana neutrinos.\nThere are two possible scenarios which exploit this window of low mass scale for leptogenesis. One is the \"soft leptogenesis\", [32, 33, 34, 35] relying on the decay of scalar\nsuperpartners of neutrino and a high degree of degeneracy [36] in the mass eigenvalues due\nto soft SUSY breaking terms. Another possibility for leptogenesis is provided by the unstable domain walls. This mechanism is analogous to that explored for the electroweak\nbaryogenesis [37], provided a source for CP asymmetry can be found. It has been shown\n[38] that the domain walls occurring in models such as to be studied in this paper generically\ngive spatially varying complex masses to neutrinos. Unstable domain walls of our models\nare therefore sufficient to ensure the required leptogenesis.\nIn an earlier work two of the authors have explored the possibility of consistent cosmology\nin this class of models, primarily the questions of removal of unwanted relics[39] and the role\nof domain walls as possible catalysers of leptogenesis[40]. Exact Left-Right symmetry of the\nunderlying model however does not permit instability of the domain walls. In [39] it was\nshown that this circumstance is avoided provided supersymmetry breaking in the hidden\nsector also breaks parity symmetry and this is signalled through the soft terms.\nSeveral proposals have been made for successful phenomenological implementation of\nSUSY in a Left-Right symmetric gauge theory [41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. Implications of gauge\nmediation of SUSY in the same was studied in [46, 47]. More recently, this model has been\nstudied in the context of the LHC in [48, 49] and also a similar low energy model in the\ncontext of cosmology in [50]. In all such models considered, spontaneous gauge symmetry\nbreaking required to recover SM phenomenology also leads to observed parity breaking.\nHowever, for cosmological reasons it is not sufficient to ensure local breakdown of parity.\nIt has been earlier proposed [51] that the occurrence of the SM like sector globally, i.e.,\nhomogeneously over the entire Universe, could be connected to the SUSY breaking effects\n3\n\n\ffrom the hidden sector.\nHere we pursue this question in the context of two classes of models, one represented by\nAulakh, Benakli, Melfo, Rasin and Senjanovic [45][43] (ABMRS) and the other, proposed\nrecently in Babu and Mohapatra, [49] (BM) both of which circumvent thorny issue of phenomenologically acceptable vacua by making minimal extensions of the basic scheme. The\nformer uses two triplets \u03a9 and \u03a9c neutral under U(1)B\u2212L while the latter uses one superfield\nS singlet under all the proposed gauge interactions as well as parity. In the approach we\nadopt, namely preservation of the Left-Right symmetry to low energies, both these models\nhave a generic issue regarding occurance of domain walls in cosmology which needs to be\naddressed. However the walls can be easily removed without conflicting with phenomenology\neven with very small parity breaking effects. In gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking\nGMSB, the SUSY breaking effects are naturally small due to being communicated at one\nloop and two loop orders. We propose the required (GMSB) scheme to obtain natural conditions for SUSY breaking and also for the disappearance of the domain walls. We show\nthat the smallness migrates into parity breaking and is adequate to ensure global choice of\ntrue ground state in the Universe.\nIn sec. II we discuss the two models ABMRS and BM. In sec. III we discuss the soft terms\narising in these models and the constraints imposed by consistent cosmology; presenting\nsome of the concerned formulae in the appendix A. In sec IV we pursue the consequence of\nimplementing generic GMSB in these theories. In sec. V we propose a modification of the\nscheme to implement combined breaking of SUSY as well as parity in a manner consistent\nwith low energy symmetries and successful cosmology. Section VI contains discussion of our\nresults.\n\nII.\n\nMINIMAL SUPERSYMMETRIC LEFT-RIGHT MODEL : A RECAP\n\nThe quark, lepton and Higgs fields for the minimal left-right SUSY model, with their\nrespective quantum numbers under the gauge group SU(3)c \u2297 SU(2)L \u2297 SU(2)R \u2297 U(1)B\u2212L\n\n4\n\n\fare given by,\nQc = (3\u2217 , 1, 2, \u22121/3),\n\nQ = (3, 2, 1, 1/3),\nL = (1, 2, 1, \u22121),\n\nLc = (1, 1, 2, 1),\n\n\u03a6i = (1, 2, 2, 0),\n\nfor i = 1, 2,\n\n\u2206 = (1, 3, 1, 2),\n\n \u0304 = (1, 3, 1, \u22122),\n\u2206\n \u0304 c = (1, 1, 3, 2).\n\u2206\n\n\u2206c = (1, 1, 3, \u22122),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere we have suppressed the generation index for simplicity of notation. In the Higgs\nsector, the bidoublet \u03a6 is doubled to have non-vanishing CKM matrix, whereas the \u2206\ntriplets are doubled to have anomaly cancellation. Under discrete parity symmetry the\nfields are prescribed to transform as,\nQ \u2194 Q\u2217c ,\n\u2206 \u2194 \u2206\u2217c ,\n\nL \u2194 L\u2217c ,\n\n\u03a6i \u2194 \u03a6\u2020i ,\n\n \u0304 \u2194\u2206\n \u0304 \u2217.\n\u2206\nc\n\n(2)\n\nHowever, this minimal left-right symmetric model is unable to break parity spontaneously\n[41, 42]. Inclusion of nonrenormalizable terms gives a more realistic structure of possible\nvacua [52][43, 44]. Such terms were studied for the case when the scale of SU(2)R breaking\nis high, close to Planck scale. We shall not pursue this possibility here further, retaining\ninterest in TeV to PeV scale phenomenology.\n\nA.\n\nThe ABMRS model with a pair of triplets\n\nDue to difficulties with the model discussed above, an early model to be called minimal\nby its authors is ABMRS[43, 44, 45]. Here two triplet fields \u03a9 and \u03a9c , were added, with the\nfollowing quantum numbers,\n\u03a9 = (1, 3, 1, 0),\n\n\u03a9c = (1, 1, 3, 0),\n\n(3)\n\nwhich was shown to improve the situation with only the renormalisable terms[43, 45, 53]. It\nwas shown that this model breaks down to minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM)\nat low scale. This model was studied in the context of cosmology in [39, 51] specifically, the\nmechanism for leptogenesis via Domain Walls in [40].\n5\n\n\fThe superpotential for this model is given by,\n(i)\n\nT\nT\ncT\nWLR = hl LT \u03c42 \u03a6i \u03c42 Lc + h(i)\nq Q \u03c42 \u03a6i \u03c42 Qc + ifL \u03c42 \u2206L + ifL \u03c42 \u2206c Lc\n \u0304 + m\u2206 Tr \u2206c \u2206\n \u0304 c + m\u03a9 Tr \u03a92 + m\u03a9 Tr \u03a92\n+ m\u2206 Tr \u2206\u2206\nc\n2\n2\n \u0304 + aTr \u2206c \u03a9c \u2206\n \u0304c\n+ \u03bcij Tr \u03c42 \u03a6Ti \u03c42 \u03a6j + aTr \u2206\u03a9\u2206\n\n+ \u03b1ij Tr \u03a9\u03a6i \u03c42 \u03a6Tj \u03c42 + \u03b1ij Tr \u03a9c \u03a6Ti \u03c42 \u03a6j \u03c42 .\n\n(4)\n\nSince supersymmetry is broken at a very low scale, we can employ the F and D flatness\nconditions obtained from the superpotential, to get a possible solution for the vacuum expectation values (vev's) for the Higgs fields.\nh\u03a9i = 0,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03c9c 0\n\uf8f8,\nh\u03a9c i = \uf8ed\n0 \u2212\u03c9c\n\nh\u2206i = 0,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 0\n\uf8f8,\nh\u2206c i = \uf8ed\ndc 0\n\n \u0304 = 0,\nh\u2206i\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 d \u0304c\n \u0304 ci = \uf8ed\n\uf8f8.\nh\u2206\n0 0\n\n(5)\n\nThis solution set is of course not unique. Since the original theory is parity invariant a\nsecond solution for the F and D flat conditions exists, with Left type fields' vev's exchanged\nwith those of the Right type fields [39, 40].\nWith vev's as in eq.

However this was shown at tree level to lead to\ncharge-breaking vacua being at a lower potential than charge-preserving vacua.\n6\n\n\fRecently, an alternative to this has been considered in [49] where a superfield S =\n(1, 1, 1, 0) also singlet under parity is included in addition to the minimal set of Higgs required as in eq. (1). The superpotential is given by,\nWLR = W (1) + W (2)\nWhere\n(i)\n\nT\nW (1) = hl LT \u03c42 \u03a6i \u03c42 Lc + h(i)\nq Q \u03c42 \u03a6i \u03c42 Qc\n\n+ if \u2217 LT \u03c42 \u2206L + ifLcT \u03c42 \u2206c Lc\n \u0304 + \u03bb Tr \u2206c \u2206\n \u0304 c + \u03bb\u2032 Tr \u03a6T \u03c42 \u03a6b \u03c42 \u2212 M 2 ]\n+ S [ \u03bb\u2217 Tr \u2206\u2206\nab\na\nR\n\n(9)\n\n \u0304 + M\u2206\u2217 Tr \u2206c \u2206\n \u0304c\nW (2) = M\u2206 Tr \u2206\u2206\n+ \u03bcab Tr \u03a6Ta \u03c42 \u03a6b \u03c42 + Ms S 2 + \u03bbs S 3\n\n(10)\n\nFor a variety of phenomenological reasons[49], the terms in W (2) may be assumed to be zero.\nThe presence of linear terms in S in W (1) makes possible the following SUSY vacuum,\nhSi = 0,\n\n\u03bbvR v\u0304R + \u03bb\u2217 vL v\u0304L = MR2\n\n(11)\n\nIn the ABMRS model, the introduction of a separate \u03a9 field for each of the sectors L\nand R permits local preference of one sector over the other through spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking. The preference however remains strictly local. Another region of space can equally\nwell have vacuum of another type. In the BM model however, due to the S field being neutral\nincluding under parity, such a distinction cannot arise even locally. This is reflected in the\nabove equation (11) where we have a flat direction in the vL - vR space 2 . A more general\ntreatment of the possible vacua is included in appendix A. Nevertheless,\nMR\n|vR | = |v\u0304R | = \u221a\n\u03bb\n\nvL = v\u0304L = 0,\n\n(12)\n\nis a possible vacuum[49] in which we recover the known phenomenology.\nThe important result is that after SUSY breaking and emergence of SUSY breaking\nsoft terms, integrating out heavy sleptons modifies the vacuum structure due to ColemanWeinberg type one-loop terms which must be treated to be of same order as the other terms\nin V ef f . Accordingly, it is shown[49] that the V ef f contains terms of the form\nef f\n\u2020 \u2020\nR\n2 2\nV1\u2212loop\n(\u2206c ) \u223c \u2212|f |2 m2Lc Tr (\u2206c \u2206\u2020c )AR\n1 \u2212 |f | mLc Tr (\u2206c \u2206c )Tr (\u2206c \u2206c )A2\n2\n\nThe first equation of sec. 3, of [49] is a special case of our condition (11)\n\n7\n\n(13)\n\n\fR\nwhere AR\n1 and A2 are constants obtained from expansion of the effective potential. Presence\n\nof these terms is shown to lead to the happy consequence of a preference for electric charge\npreserving vacuum over the charge breaking vacuum, provided m2Lc < 0.\nFor the purpose of the present paper it is important to note that even assuming that\nsome soft terms will lift the flat direction in (11), we still have no source of breaking L-R\nsymmetry. This means that\nMR\n|vL | = |v\u0304L | = \u221a\n\u03bb\u2217\n\nvR = v\u0304R = 0,\n\n(14)\n\nalso constitutes a valid solution of eq. (11). In this vacuum the soft terms can give rise to\nthe following terms in the effective potential,\nef f\nV1\u2212loop\n(\u2206) \u223c \u2212|f |2 m2L Tr (\u2206\u2206\u2020 )AL1 \u2212 |f |2 m2L Tr (\u2206\u2206)Tr (\u2206\u2020 \u2206\u2020 )AL2\n\n(15)\n\nwith AL1 and AL2 constants. Thus the choice of known phenomenology is only one of two\npossible local choices, and formation of domain walls is inevitable.\n\nIII.\n\nCOSMOLOGY OF BREAKING AND SOFT TERMS\n\nDue to the existence of two different sets of solutions for the possible vev's, formation of\ndomain walls (DW) is inevitable [39, 40] in both the models considered above. Stable walls\nare known to overclose the Universe[20][55] and are undesirable. However, a small inequality\nin the free energies in the vacua on the two sides of the walls is sufficient to destabilize them.\nThe lower bound on the temperature upto which such walls may persist in the Universe is\nset by the known physics of BBN, T \u223c 1MeV . Let the temperature by which the wall\ncomplex has substantially decayed, in particular has ceased to dominate the energy density\nof the Universe, be TD . It has been estimated that the free energy density difference \u03b4\u03c1\nbetween the vacua which determines the pressure difference across a domain wall should be\nof the form [56][57]\n\u03b4\u03c1 \u223c TD4\n\n(16)\n\nin order for the DW to disappear at the scale TD .\nIt has been observed in [58] that parity breaking effects suppressed by Planck scale are\nsufficient to remove the DW. Black Holes can carry only locally conserved charges, and\ntherefore there would exist processes in Quantum Gravity which do not conserve global\n8\n\n\fcharges as well as violate discrete symmetry such as parity. Thus we expect parity breaking\nterms induced by quantum gravity in the effective lagrangian. Assuming that the pressure\nacross the walls is created by terms such as C\u03c66 /MP2 l , it is easy to check that reasonable range\nof values of the order parameter h\u03c6i and TD exist for which the walls can disappear without\n\nconflicting with cosmology. This is especially true of high scale models, MR & 1011 GeV. We\n\nshall be interested in a low (PeV) scale model where Planck scale effects can be ignorable\nand where the parity breaking should arise from known effects which can be counterchecked\nagainst other observables.\nIn ABMRS model at the scale MR , SU(2)R \u2297 U(1)B\u2212L breaks to U(1)R \u2297 U(1)B\u2212L ,\nequally well, SU(2)L \u2297 U(1)B\u2212L breaks to U(1)L \u2297 U(1)B\u2212L depending on which of the\ntwo \u03a9 fields acquires a vev. Thus domain walls are formed at the scale MR . At a lower\nscale MB\u2212L when the Higgs triplet \u2206's get vev, U(1)R \u2297 U(1)B\u2212L breaks to U(1)Y or U(1)L\n\u2297 U(1)B\u2212L breaks to U(1)Y \u2032 . In BM model the breaking is directly to SU(2)L \u2297 U(1)Y or\n\nequally well, SU(2)R \u2297 U(1)\u2032Y . As per the analysis reported above we are assuming that the\nS field does not acquire a vev. Thus in each of the models we have MSSM after the MB\u2212L\nor the MR scale, respectively. SUSY breaking soft terms emerge below the SUSY breaking\nscale MS . We now proceed with the stipulation advanced in [51] that the role of the hidden\n\nsector dynamics is not only to break SUSY but also break parity. This permits in principle a\nrelation between observables arising from the two apparently independent breaking effects.\nThe soft terms which arise in the two models ABMRS and BM may be parameterized as\nfollows\n \u0304\u2206\n \u0304 \u2020)\nL1sof t = m21 Tr(\u2206\u2206\u2020 ) + m22 Tr(\u2206\n \u0304 c\u2206\n \u0304 \u2020)\n+ m23 Tr(\u2206c \u2206\u2020c ) + m24 Tr(\u2206\nc\n\n(17)\n\n \u0304 \u2206\n \u0304 \u2020)\nL2sof t = \u03b11 Tr(\u2206\u03a9\u2206\u2020 ) + \u03b12 Tr(\u2206\u03a9\n \u0304 c \u03a9c \u2206\n \u0304 \u2020)\n+ \u03b13 Tr(\u2206c \u03a9c \u2206\u2020c ) + \u03b14 Tr(\u2206\nc\nL3sof t = \u03b21 Tr(\u03a9\u03a9\u2020 ) + \u03b22 Tr(\u03a9c \u03a9\u2020c )\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\n \u0304\u2206\n \u0304 \u2020 )]\nL4sof t = S[\u03b31 Tr(\u2206\u2206\u2020 ) + \u03b32 Tr(\u2206\n \u0304 c\u2206\n \u0304 \u2020 )]\n+ S \u2217 [\u03b33 Tr(\u2206c \u2206\u2020c ) + \u03b34 Tr(\u2206\nc\nL5sof t = \u03c3\u0303 2 |S|2\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\n9\n\n\fTD /GeV\n\n\u223c 10\n\n(m2 \u2212 m2\u2032 )/GeV2 \u223c 10\u22124\n\n102 103\n1\n\n104\n\n(\u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22 )/GeV2 \u223c 10\u22128 10\u22124 1\nTABLE I: Differences in values of soft supersymmetry breaking parameters for a range of domain\nwall decay temperature values TD . The differences signify the extent of parity breaking.\n\nFor ABMRS model the relevant soft terms are given by,\nLsof t = L1sof t + L2sof t + L3sof t\n\n(22)\n\nFor BM model the soft terms are given by,\nLsof t = L1sof t + L4sof t + L5sof t\n\n(23)\n\nUsing the requirement of eq. (16) we can constrain the differences between the soft terms\nin the Left and Right sectors [39, 40]. According to eq. (11) S field does not acquire a vev\nin the physically relevant vacua and hence the terms in eq.s (20) and (21) do not contribute\nto the vacuum energy. The terms in eq. (18) are suppressed in magnitude relative to those\nin eq. (19) due to having \u03a9 vev's to one power lower. This argument assumes that the\nmagnitude of the coefficients \u03b1 are such as to not mix up the symmetry breaking scales of\nthe \u03a9's and the \u2206's.\nTo obtain orders of magnitude we have taken the m2i parameters to be of the form\n\u2032\n\nm21 \u223c m22 \u223c m2 and m23 \u223c m24 \u223c m 2 [40] with TD in the range 10 \u2212 103 GeV [24]. For both\nthe models we have taken the value of the \u2206 vev's as d \u223c 104 GeV. For ABMRS model\n\nadditionally we take \u03c9 \u223c 106 GeV. The resulting differences required for successful removal\nof domain walls are shown in Table I.\nWe see from table I that assuming both the mass-squared differences m2 \u2212m\u20322 and \u03b21 \u2212\u03b22\narise from the same dynamics, \u03a9 fields are the determinant of the cosmology. This is because\nthe lower bound on the wall disappearance temperature TD required by \u03a9 fields is higher\nand the corresponding TD is reached sooner. This situation changes if for some reason \u03a9's\ndo not contribute to the pressure difference across the walls. The BM model does not have\n\u03a9's and falls in this category.\n10\n\n\fDuring the period of time in between destabilization of the DW and their decay, leptogenesis occurs due to these unstable DW as discussed in [38, 40]. After the disappearance\nof the walls at the scale TD , electroweak symmetry breaks at a scale MEW \u223c 102 GeV and\nstandard cosmology takes over. In the next section we discuss the implementation of GMSB\nscenario for these models.\n\nIV.\n\nGAUGE MEDIATED SUSY BREAKING IN MINIMAL SUPERSYMMETRIC\n\nMODELS\n\nIn gauge mediated SUSY breaking proposal, dynamical breaking of SUSY in a hidden\nsector is communicated to visible sector through a field X singlet under visible gauge interactions, and one or more conjugate pairs of chiral superfields called messenger fields which\ntogether constitute a vector like, anomaly free representation [59, 60, 61]. For reviews the\nreader may refer [17, 62, 63]. The choice of charges for the messenger fields ensures that they\ndo not spoil gauge coupling unification. A simple choice is to choose them to be complete\nrepresentations of the possible grand unification group, which in the Left-Right symmetric\ncase is SO(10).\nThe dynamical SUSY breakdown causes the messenger fields to develop SUSY violating\ninteractions with the hidden sector, while they also interact with the (s)quarks, (s)leptons\nand Higgs(inos) via gauge and gauginos interactions. Gaugino fields get a mass at one loop\ndue to these interactions, while gauge invariance prevents gauge fields from acquiring any\nmass. As such supersymmetry is broken in the visible sector.\nWe denote the messenger sector fields to be \u03a6i and its complex conjugate representation\nto be \u03a6\u0304i , with i indexing the set of several possible messengers. These couple to a chiral\nsuperfield singlet X via yukawa type interaction.\nW =\n\nX\n\nyi X\u03a6i \u03a6\u0304i ,\n\n(24)\n\ni\n\nIt should be noted that in the case of BM model, this X could be identified with S. Coupling\nof X to the hidden sector gives rise to vacuum expectation values hXi and hFX i for its scalar\nand auxiliary parts respectively. As such the fermionic and scalar parts of the messenger\nsector get masses,\nm2f = |yi hXi|2 ,\n\nm2s = |yi hXi|2 \u00b1 |yi hFX i|\n11\n\n(25)\n\n\fThus, the degeneracy between the fermionic and scalar part of the messenger sector vanishes.\nGaugino mass arises due to one loop diagrams and is given [60]\nMa =\n\n\u03b1a hFX i\n(1 + O(x)) ,\n4\u03c0 hXi\n\n(a = 1, 2, 3)\n\n(26)\n\nwhere x = hFX i/(\u03bbhXi2).

However, there is\nno signal of global parity breakdown and the problem of domain walls persists. In the next\nsection we propose a modification of this standard GMSB to explain parity breaking.\n\nV.\n\nCUSTOMIZED GMSB FOR LEFT-RIGHT SYMMETRIC MODELS\n\nThe differences required between the soft terms of the Left and the Right sector for the\nDW to disappear at a temperature TD as given in Table I are very small. Reasons for\n12\n\n\fappearance of this small asymmetry between the Left and the Right fields is hard to explain\nsince the original theory is parity symmetric. However, we now try to explain the origin of\nthis small difference by focusing on the hidden sector, and relating it to SUSY breaking.\nFor this purpose we assume that the strong dynamics responsible for SUSY breaking also\nbreaks parity, which is then transmitted to the visible sector via the messenger sector and\nencoded in the soft supersymmetry breaking terms. We implement this idea by introducing\ntwo singlet fields X and X \u2032 , respectively even and odd under parity.\nX \u2032 \u2194 \u2212X \u2032 .\n\nX \u2194 X,\n\n(30)\n\nThe messenger sector superpotential then contains terms\nW =\n\nX\u0002\n\n\u03bbn X \u03a6nL \u03a6\u0304nL + \u03a6nR \u03a6\u0304nR\n\nn\n\n+ \u03bb\u2032n X \u2032 \u03a6nL \u03a6\u0304nL \u2212 \u03a6nR \u03a6\u0304nR\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\u0003\n\n(31)\n\nFor simplicity, we consider n = 1. The fields \u03a6L , \u03a6\u0304L and \u03a6R , \u03a6\u0304R are complete representations\nof a simple gauge group embedding the L-R symmetry group. Further we require that the\nfields labelled L get exchanged with fields labelled R under an inner automorphism which\nexchanges SU(2)L and SU(2)R charges, e.g. the charge conjugation operation in SO(10).\nAs a simple possibility we consider the case when \u03a6L , \u03a6\u0304L (respectively, \u03a6R , \u03a6\u0304R ) are neutral\nunder SU(2)R (SU(2)L ). Generalization to other representations is straightforward.\nAs a result of the dynamical SUSY breaking we expect the fields X and X \u2032 to develop\nnontrivial vev's and F terms and hence give rise to mass scales\n\u039bX =\n\nhFX i\n,\nhXi\n\n\u039bX \u2032 =\n\nhFX \u2032 i\n.\nhX \u2032 i\n\n(32)\n\nBoth of these are related to the dynamical SUSY breaking scale MS , however their values are\ndifferent unless additional reasons of symmetry would force them to be identical. Assuming\nthat they are different but comparable in magnitude we can show that Left-Right breaking\ncan be achieved simultaneously with SUSY breaking being communicated.\nIn the proposed model, the messenger fermions receive respective mass contributions\nmfL = |\u03bbhXi + \u03bb\u2032 hX \u2032 i|\nmfR = |\u03bbhXi \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 hX \u2032 i|\n13\n\n(33)\n\n\fwhile the messenger scalars develop the masses\nm2\u03c6L = |\u03bbhXi + \u03bb\u2032 hX \u2032 i|2 \u00b1 |\u03bbhFX i + \u03bb\u2032 hFX \u2032 i|\n\n(34)\n\nm2\u03c6R = |\u03bbhXi \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 hX \u2032i|2 \u00b1 |\u03bbhFX i \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 hFX \u2032 i|\nWe thus have both SUSY and parity breaking communicated through these particles.\nAs a result the mass contributions to the gauginos of SU(2)L and SU(2)R from both the\nX and X \u2032 fields with their corresponding auxiliary parts take the simple form,\nMaL =\n\n\u03b1a \u03bbhFX i + \u03bb\u2032 hFX \u2032 i\n(1 + O(xL ))\n4\u03c0 \u03bbhXi + \u03bb\u2032 hX \u2032 i\n\nwhere\nxL =\nand\nMaR =\nwith\n\n(35)\n\n\u03bbhFX i + \u03bb\u2032 hFX \u2032 i\n|\u03bbhXi + \u03bb\u2032 hX \u2032 i|2\n\n(36)\n\n\u03b1a \u03bbhFX i \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 hFX \u2032 i\n(1 + O(xR ))\n4\u03c0 \u03bbhXi \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 hX \u2032 i\n\n(37)\n\n\u03bbhFX i \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 hFX \u2032 i\n(38)\n|\u03bbhXi \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 hX \u2032 i|2\nHere a = 1, 2, 3.

This can be used to\nestimate the magnitude of the overall scale \u039bX to be \u2265 30 TeV [63] from collider limits.\nReturning to cosmology requirements, we see from table I that the required mass-squared\ndifferences are rather small, and hence it is required to assume that ratios tan \u03b3 and tan \u03c3\nmust be small. Under this assumption, we expand the quantity in square brackets in eq.s\n(41) and (43) in small quantities to find its magnitude 4(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03c3) +O(\u03b3 2 , \u03c3 2 ). The resulting\nrequirement on the values this small parameter is shown in Table II for various values of TD ,\nthe scale at which the DW finally disappear.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn Left-Right symmetric models, domain walls generically arise in cosmology. It is necessary to assume the presence of dynamics that eventually signals departure from exact\nLeft-Right symmetry. In the absence of such a dynamics the universe would remain trapped\nin an unacceptable phase. We have explored models where the scale of Left-Right symmetry and the accompanying gauged B \u2212 L symmetry are both low, within a few orders of\nmagnitude of the electroweak scale. In earlier work we have obtained bounds on the parity\n15\n\n\fbreaking parameters so that domain walls do not conflict with phenomenology, at the same\ntime providing mechanisms for leptogenesis as well as weak inflation[22, 23]. The latter\nis an effective ways of diluting the density of unwanted relics[24]. Wall disappearance is a\nnonadiabatic phenomenon and could leave behind imprints on primordial gravitational wave\nbackground [21].\nThe possibilities considered in this paper fall into two categories, whether weak inflation is\npermitted or not. Leptogenesis is permitted in all the cases considered here. Weak inflation\nbecomes possible if the domain walls linger around for a substantial time, dominating the\nenergy density of the universe for a limited period. The walls are long lived if the pressure\ndifference across the walls is small, as happens if the parity breaking effects are small and\ndifference in effective potential across the walls is small.\nIn this paper we have explored the possibility that smallness of the parity breaking effect\nis related to the indirect supersymmetry breaking effects. To be specific we have studied\ntwo viable implementations of Left-Right symmetry, the ABMRS and BM models discussed\nin section II, and studied them in the context of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking\nas the mechanism. We have explored a variant of the latter mechanism in order to achieve\nparity breaking to be signalled from within the dynamical supersymmetry breaking sector.\nDynamical symmetry breaking effects are associated with strong dynamics and parity is\nusually susceptible to breaking in their presence.\nOur implementation of GMSB contains two ringlets X, even under parity and X \u2032 odd\nunder parity in the hidden sector and coupled to messengers. Obtaining small parity breaking effect in this context generically requires that the scales of the vev's of X and X \u2032 be\nfinely tuned to the same value as seen in table II. While this is not unnatural since the\nstrong dynamics is unknown, it raises the need to explore the latter further. In this case all\nthe cosmological requirements can be met.\nFrom table I we see that given that the same dynamics determines the soft terms in\n\u2206 and \u03a9 effective lagrangians, the lower bound on TD required by \u03a9 fields is higher, thus\ndetermining the TD . On the other hand from table II, we see that given a desirable value\nof TD the terms in \u2206 lagrangian require less fine tuning than the those in the \u03a9 lagrangian.\nSince in the BM model the singlet does not signal any new mass scale, it is the scale of \u2206\nvev's which determines the TD . For this reason it would be more natural model from the\npoint of view of cosmology.\n16\n\n\fThe ABMRS model becomes equally good a contender if for some reason the \u03a9 vev scale\ndoes not enter the wall disappearance mechanism. One way this could occur is if the SUSY\nbreaking effects were communicated primarily to the \u2206 sector but not the \u03a9 sector. In a class\nof models considered in [46, 47] SUSY breaking gets communicated by fields charged only\nunder B \u2212 L and no other charges. Since the \u03a9 are neutral under B \u2212 L they would receive\nthe SUSY breaking effects only as higher order effects. In this category of SUSY breaking\nmodels ABMRS would require less fine tuning to ensure solution of all the cosmological\nissues studied here.\n\nVII.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nWe thank K. S.
