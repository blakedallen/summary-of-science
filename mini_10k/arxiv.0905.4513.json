GONZ\u00c1LEZ-S\u00c1NCHEZ AND T. S. WEIGEL\nAbstract. A finite group G is called pi -central of height k if every element of\norder pi of G is contained in the k th -term \u03b6k (G) of the ascending central series\nof G. If p is odd such a group has to be p-nilpotent (Thm. A). Finite p-central\np-groups of height p \u2212 2 can be seen as the dual analogue of finite potent pgroups, i.e., for such a finite p-group P the group P/\u03a91 (P ) is also p-central of\nheight p \u2212 2 (Thm. B). In such a group P the index of P p is less or equal than\nthe order of the subgroup \u03a91 (P ) (Thm. C). If the Sylow p-subgroup P of a\nfinite group G is p-central of height p \u2212 1, p odd, and NG (P ) is p-nilpotent,\nthen G is also p-nilpotent (Thm. D). Moreover, if G is a p-soluble finite group,\np odd, and P \u2208 Sylp (G) is p-central of height p \u2212 2, then NG (P ) controls\np-fusion in G (Thm. E). It is well-known that the last two properties hold for\nSwan groups (see [11]).\n\n1. Introduction\nLet p be a prime number. Following a suggestion of A. Mann1 we call a finite\ngroup G p-central if every element of order p is central in G, i.e., let\n(1.1)\n\ni\n\n\u03a9i (G, p) = h g \u2208 G | g p = 1 i,\n\ni \u2265 0;\n\nthen G is p-central if, and only if, \u03a91 (G, p) \u2264 Z(G). For a finite p-group P we put\n\u03a9i (P ) = \u03a9i (P, p). Obviously, subgroups of p-central groups are p-central.\nPowerful finite p-groups play an important role in the study of compact p-adic\nanalytic groups (see [6, \u00a73]). For finite p-central p-groups the notion of p-centrality\nis the dual analogue of being powerful provided p is odd. Although one must say\nthat p-centrality plays a less important role in the study of pro-p groups, finite\np-central groups are quite often the most important examples when it comes to\nexplicit computations in cohomology or homotopy of classifying spaces of finite\ngroups (see for example [3], [11, Thm. 1.7], [23]).\nIn this note we study a more general class of finite groups. For i, k \u2265 1 we say\nthat a finite group G is pi -central of height k if \u03a9i (G, p) \u2264 \u03b6k (G), where \u03b6k (G)\ndenotes the k th -term of the ascending central series of G. In particular, if G is a\nfinite pi -central group of height k, then \u03a9i (G, p) is a p-group. If G is a pi -central\ngroup of height 1 we simply call G pi -central. For odd primes p one can restrict the\nanalysis of finite p-central groups to the study of p-central p-groups (see \u00a73.5).\nDate: October 30, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Mann suggested this terminology to the second author during a train journey from Dublin\nto Galway in 1994.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJ. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-S\u00c1NCHEZ AND T. S. WEIGEL\n\nTheorem A. Let p be odd, and let G be a finite p-central group of height k \u2265 1.\nThen G is p-nilpotent, i.e., if P \u2208 Sylp (G) is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, then P has\na normal complement in G.\nFor p-central finite groups Theorem A was already proved in [23, Thm. 2.4].\nExample 1.1. For an odd prime number r the finite group G = SL2 (r) is 2-central.\nHence Theorem A does not hold for p = 2.\nThe first remarkable result for finite p-central p-groups is the fact that for a\nfinite p-central p-group P , p odd, P/\u03a9i (P ) is also p-central, i.e., (\u03a9i (P ))i\u22651 is an\nascending central series of P . In this form one can find this result in a paper by\nJ. Buckley (see [4]). However, in his first book which appeared three years earlier\nB. Huppert cited an unpublished result of J. G. Thompson (see [12, Hilfssatz 12.2])\nreproducing a proof he is giving credit to N. Blackburn which is also implying the\njust mentioned statement. For this reason we refer to this result as the BlackburnBuckley-Thompson theorem. For p = 2 it remains true if one requires that \u03a92 (P )\nis contained in the center of P (see [15]). In Section 2.2 we will prove the following\ngeneralization.\nTheorem B. Let k and i be positive integers such that k \u2264 p \u2212 2 or k = p \u2212 1 and\ni \u2265 2. Let P be a pi -central pro-p group of height k such that the torsion elements\nof P form a finite p-group. Then, for all j \u2265 1, P/\u03a9j (P ) is also a pi -central pro-p\ngroup of height k. Moreover\n(1.2)\n\nj\n\n\u03a9j (P ) = {x \u2208 P | xp = 1}.\n\nSome families of finite p-groups - like powerful or regular groups - have a nice\npower structure. In particular, the index of the agemo subgroup (the subgroup\nbeing generated by the p-powers or, simply, P p ) is equal to the number of elements\nof order p (see [7], [10]). For an arbitrary finite p-group P the index |P : P p |\nis bounded in terms of p and |\u03a91 (P )|, i.e., there exist a function f such that\n|P : P p | \u2264 f (p, |\u03a91 (P )|) (see [9], [16]). In a finite p-central p-group P of height\np \u2212 2 the index of the agemo subgroup is bounded just by the cardinality of |\u03a91 (P )|\n(see \u00a72.3).\nTheorem C. Let k, i be positive integers such that k \u2264 p \u2212 2 or k = p \u2212 1 and\ni \u2265 2, and let P be a pi -central p-group of height k. Then\n(1.3)\n\n|P : P p | \u2264 |\u03a91 (P )|.\n\nMoreover, if P p = {xp | x \u2208 P }, then equality holds in (1.3).\nIn [11], S. Priddy and H-W. Henn showed that a finite p-central p-group P , p\nodd2, is a Swan group, i.e., if G is a finite group containing P as Sylow p-subgroup,\nthen the restriction map in cohomology\n(1.4)\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\nresG\nNG (P ) : H (G, Fp ) \u2212\u2192 H (NG (P ), Fp )\n\nis an isomorphism of N0 -graded, connected, anti-commutative Fp -algebras. As\npointed out by J. Th\u00e9venaz in [21] a finite p-group P is a Swan group if, and\nonly if, NG (P ) controls p-fusion in G for all finite groups G with P \u2208 Sylp (G). This\nproperty of p-central groups seems to be very particular, and one cannot expect\nthat it holds in a much more general context (see Ex. 1.2). Nevertheless, there are\ntwo weaker properties which also hold for p-central groups of small height.\n2For p = 2 one has to require that (\u03a9 (P ))\ni\ni\u22651 is an ascending central series.\n\n\fFINITE P-CENTRAL GROUPS OF HEIGHT K\n\n3\n\nExample 1.2. Let p \u2265 5, n \u2265 2 and put G = SL2 (Z/pn .Z). Then P \u2208 Sylp (G) is\np-central of height 3, but NG (P ) does not control p-fusion in G. Hence, by [17], P\nis not a Swan group.\nA finite p-group P will be called to determine p-nilpotency locally if the following\nholds: Let G be a finite group containing P as Sylow p-subgroup such that NG (P )\nis p-nilpotent. Then G is also p-nilpotent. From J. Tate's nilpotency criterion (see\n[20]) it follows that Swan groups determine p-nilpotency locally. For finite p-central\np-groups of small height we will show the following (see \u00a74).\nTheorem D. Let p be odd, and let P be a finite p-central p-group of height p \u2212 1.\nThen P determines p-nilpotency locally.\nFinite p-central p-groups of small height possess a 'Swan group like' property\nwhich concerns their embeddings into p-soluble groups. For simplicity we say that a\np-soluble group G is a p\u2032 pp\u2032 -sandwich group, if Op (G/Op\u2032 (G)) is a Sylow p-subgroup\nof G/Op\u2032 (G). In Section 5.2 we will show the following.\nTheorem E. Let p be odd, and let G be a finite p-soluble group containing a pcentral Sylow p-subgroup P of height p \u2212 2. Then G is a p\u2032 pp\u2032 -sandwich group. In\nparticular, NG (P ) controls p-fusion in G.\nThe mod p cohomology ring H \u2022 (G) = H \u2022 (G, Fp ) of a finite p-central group G is\nmuch easier to analyze than for an arbitrary finite group. In [3], C. Broto and HW. Henn showed that H \u2022 (G) is Cohen-Macaulay. Thus by a result of D. J. Benson\nand J. F. Carlson (see [2]) its Hilbert series\nP\n(1.5)\nhG (t) = k\u2208N0 dimFp (H k (G)).tk\n\nsatisfies some functional equation. In case that p is odd and G satisfies some additional property - the \u03a91 -extension property (see Remark 2.5) - one can determine\nthe Fp -algebra structure of H \u2022 (G) explicitly modulo some finite-dimensional Fp algebra which satisfies Poincar\u00e9 duality (see [23]).\nA finite p-central p-group P of height 2 may have maximal elementary abelian\nsubgroups of different order, and thus, its mod p-cohomology ring will not be CohenMacaulay (see [2]). In order to know whether one can extend the result of C. Broto\nand H-W. Henn to p-central p-groups of height p \u2212 2, it would be interesting to\ninvestigate the following question.\nQuestion F. Let p be odd, and let P be a finite p-central p-group of height p \u2212 2\nsuch that \u03a9k (P )/\u03a9k\u22121 (P ) is abelian for all k \u2265 1. Is H \u2022 (P ) Cohen-Macaulay?\nAcknowledgement. The authors would like to thank A. E. Zalesskii for some\nvery helpful discussions.\nNotations and basic definitions. We use the standard notations in group theory.\nMultiple commutators will always supposed to be left normed. We simply write\nj\n[N,(k) M ] for the commutator [N, M, . . . , M ] with M appearing k-times. By Gp\nwe denote the (closed) subgroup of the (topological) group G which is (topologically) generated by the pj -powers of G; \u03a9i (G, p) will denote the (closed) subgroup\ngenerated by the elements of order less or equal to pi . For a (closed) normal subgroup N of G we denote by N 1/p the (closed) normal subgroup generated by the\nset {x \u2208 G | xp \u2208 N }.\n\n\f4\n\nJ. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-S\u00c1NCHEZ AND T. S.

Let p be odd, let Cpi+1 be the cyclic group of order pi+1 , i \u2265 1, and\nlet A denotePits canonical homomorphic image of order p. Let M = Zp [A]/Zp .\u2206,\nwhere \u2206 = a\u2208A a. The semi-direct product P = Cpi+1 \u22c9 M , with the canonical\naction of Cpi+1 on M , is a p-adic analytic pro-p group which is pi -central. However,\nP/\u03a9i (P ) is not p-central. If c \u2208 Cpi+1 is a generator and a \u2208 M , then c.a is an\nelement of order pi+1 . Hence the closed subgroup of P generated by all torsion\nelements is the entire group P .\nTheorem B can be applied also to certain families of p-central pro-p groups.\nCorollary 2.4. Let P be a pi -central p-adic analytic pro-p group of height k such\nj\nthat \u03b3h(p\u22121) (P ) \u2264 \u03b3i (P )p with h(p \u2212 1) < j(p \u2212 1) + i. Then P/\u03a9j (P ) is also a\nj\npi -central pro-p group of height k and \u03a9j (P ) = { x \u2208 P | xp = 1 }.\nProof. By [8, Thm. 4.8], the torsion elements of P form a finite p-group. Thus\nTheorem B yields the claim.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.5. Let p be odd, and let P be a p-central p-group of height k, k \u2264 p \u2212 2.\nWe say that P has the \u03a91 -extension property if there exists a finite p-central p-group\nQ of height k such that P \u2243 Q/\u03a91 (Q). It can be shown that all p-groups3 described\nin Example 2.1 have this property. However, there are examples of p-central groups\nwhich do not have this property. For p-central p-groups of height 1 this property\nhas a strong impact on the structure of the Fp -cohomology algebra H \u2022 (P, Fp ) (see\n[23]). It is very likely that this is also the case for p-central p-groups of height larger\nthan 1 but less than p \u2212 2.\n2.3. Bounding the index of the agemo subgroup. For a finite p-group P we\ndefine the following series of characteristic subgroups:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2[\u03a91 (P ),(p\u2212n\u22121) P ] if n \u2264 p \u2212 1,\n(2.12)\nMn (P ) =\n\uf8f3\nMn\u2212p+1 (P )1/p\notherwise.\nIt is easy to check that Mn+1 (P ) \u2265 Mn (P ). For n < 0 we put Mn (P ) = 1. If P is\na p-central p-group of height p \u2212 2 (resp. a p2 -central group of height p \u2212 1) this\nseries has the following properties.\n\nProposition 2.6. Let p be odd, let P be a finite p-central p-group of height p \u2212 2\n(resp. a p2 -central group of height p\u22121), and let n \u2265 0.

(a) We restrict our considerations to the case when P is p-central of height\np \u2212 2. The case when P is p2 -central of height p \u2212 1 follows by a similar argument\n(see proof of Theorem B).\nBy Theorem B, it suffices to prove the statement for n \u2264 p \u2212 1.

For r large, (2.14) is certainly true. Suppose\nthat (2.14) is true for r + 1. Then, by Lemma 2.3,\n(2.15)\n\n[[\u03a91 (P ),(s) P ]1/p ,(r) P ]p \u2264 [\u03a91 (P ),(s+r) P ][[\u03a91 (P ),(s) P ]1/p ,(r+p\u22121) P ]\n\u2264 [\u03a91 (P ),(p\u22122) P ] = 1.\n\nHence [[\u03a91 (P ),(s) P ]1/p ,(r) P ] \u2264 \u03a91 (P ), and this yields the claim.\n(b) We may assume that n \u2265 p \u2212 1, and proceed by induction on n. By (a) and\ninduction, one has\n(2.16)\np\n[Mn (P ), P ] = [Mn\u2212p+1 (P )1/p , P ]p \u2264 [Mn\u2212p+1 (P ), P ][Mn\u2212p+1 (P )1/p ,(p) P ]\n\u2264 Mn\u2212p (P ) [Mn\u2212p+1 , P ] = Mn\u2212p (P ).\nHence [Mn (P ), P ] \u2264 Mn\u22121 (P ).\n(c) is obvious.\n(d) By the Hall-Petrescu formula (see [12, Theorem 9.4]) one has\n(2.17)\n\n(xy)p \u2261 xp y p\n\n(mod [Mm (P ), P ]p [Mm (P ),(p\u22121) P ]).\n\nThus if m \u2264 p \u2212 1 there is nothing to prove.

Thus m\u2022 (P ) is a graded Fp [t\u2022 ]\nmodule. Moreover, by construction of the series (Mn (P ))n\u22650 , one has\n`\n(2.19)\nAnn(t\u2022 ) = m(p\u22121) (P ) = 0\u2264n\u2264p\u22122 Mn+1 (P )/Mn (P ).\n`\nFor any subgroup Q of P we put m\u2022 (Q) = n\u2208N (Q \u2229 Mn+1 (P ))Mn (P )/Mn (P ).\nHence by (2.19), Ann(t\u2022 ) = m\u2022 (\u03a91 (P )). On the other hand one has\n`\n(2.20)\nt\u2022 .M (P ) = n\u2208N Mn+p (P )p Mn (P )/Mn (P )\n\nand\n\n(2.21)\n\nm\u2022 (P p ) =\n\n`\n\nn\u2208N (P\n\np\n\n\u2229 Mn+1 (P ))Mn (P )/Mn (P ).\n\nAs Mn+p (P )p \u2264 P p \u2229 Mn+1 (P ), one has\n(2.22) |P : P p | = |m\u2022 (P ) : m\u2022 (P p )| \u2264 |m\u2022 (P ) : t\u2022 .m\u2022 (P )| = | Ann(t\u2022 )| = |\u03a91 (P )|.\nMoreover, if P p = { xp | x \u2208 P }, then P p \u2229 Mn+1 (P ) = Mn+p (P )p .

Zalesskii one can then\ndescribe the size of a Jordan block of an element of order p in a p-soluble group\nG on any finite semi-simple left Fq [G]-module (see Cor. 5.2). This description will\nallow us to establish a sufficient criterion for the normality of a Sylow p-subgroup\nin a finite p-soluble group provided p is odd (see Lemma 5.3).\n5.1. The Fong-Swan-Rukolaine theorem. The following theorem can be seen\nas a module theoretic version of I. M. Isaacs version of the Fong-Swan-Rukolaine\ntheorem.\nTheorem 5.1. Let G be a finite p-soluble group, let E be a finite field of characteristic p and let M be an absolutely irreducible left E[G]-module. Then there exists a\nfinite extension Fq /E of E and a left Zq [G]-lattice L with the following properties:\n(i) L/p.L \u2243 M \u2297E Fq ;\n(ii) L \u2297Zq Qq is an absolutely irreducible left Qq [G]-module.\nProof. Let \u0112 denote an algebraic closure of E, let Q\u0304p denote an algebraic closure\nof Qp , and let Qun\np denote the maximal unramified extension of Qp in Q\u0304p . Let \u03c7\u0304M\ndenote the Brauer character of M \u2297E \u0112. By [13] and [14], there exists an irreducible\n\n\fFINITE P-CENTRAL GROUPS OF HEIGHT K\n\n11\n\nleft Q\u0304p [G]-module V such that the restriction of its character to p-regular conjugacy\nclasses of G agrees with \u03c7\u0304M , and all its character values are contained in Qun\np . Then\nby [22, Lemma 3.3], there exists a finite unramified extension Qq /Qp of Qp and an\nabsolutely irreducible left Qq [G]-module W such that V \u2243 W \u2297Qq Q\u0304p . We may\nassume that Fq contains E. Let L < W be a full left Zq [G]-lattice contained in\nW . Then by construction L/p.L \u2243 M \u2297Fq E, and L \u2297Zq Qq \u2243 W . This yields the\nclaim.\n\u0003\nFrom [22, Lemma 3.1] one concludes the following corollary.\nCorollary 5.2. Let G be a finite p-soluble group, let M be a finite semi-simple\nFq [G]-module, and let \u03c6 : G \u2192 EndFq (M ) be the representation associated to M .\nThen for every element g \u2208 G of order p the size of a Jordan block of \u03c6(g) is either\n1, p \u2212 1 or p.\nCorollary 5.2 can be translated into a group theoretic context as follows:\nLemma 5.3. Let G be a finite p-soluble group, p 6= 2, and let P \u2208 Sylp (G). Let\nM be a finitely generated Fp [G]-module, and let \u03c6M : G \u2192 GLFp (M ) denote the\nassociated representation. Assume further that\n(i) ker(\u03c6M ) \u2264 Op (G);\n(ii) for all g \u2208 P , (\u03c6M (g) \u2212 idM )p\u22122 = 0.\nThen P = ker(\u03c6M ); in particular, P is normal in G.\nProof. Let \u03c0 : M \u2192 M ss denote the semi-simplification of the Fp [G]-module M , and\nlet \u03c6M ss : G \u2192 GLFp (M ss ) denote the associated Fp -linear representation. By (i),\nker(\u03c6M ) is a normal p-subgroup. Let \u03c6\u0303M : Fp [G] \u2192 EndFp (M ) denote the associated homomorphism of Fp -algebras. Then\n(5.1)\n\nker(\u03c6M ss )/ ker(\u03c6M ) \u2264 idM + Jac(im(\u03c6\u0303M )),\n\nwhere Jac( ) denotes the Jacobson radical. In particular, ker(\u03c6M ss )/ ker(\u03c6M ) is a\np-group, and thus ker(\u03c6M ss ) is a normal p-subgroup of G.\nLet g \u2208 P \u25e6 = \u03c6M ss (P ) be an element satisfying g p = 1. Since \u03c6M ss (G) is psoluble and as M ss is a semi-simple left Fp [\u03c6M ss (G)]-module, Corollary 5.2 implies\nthat a Jordan block of g must have length 1, p \u2212 1 or p. Hypothesis (ii) yields that\n(g \u2212 1)p\u22122 = 0 \u2208 EndFp (M ss ). Thus every Jordan block of g must have size 1; i.e.,\ng = 1. Therefore, P \u25e6 = {1}, and this yields the claim.\n\u0003\n5.2. The sandwich theorem. Let G be a finite group. By Op\u2032 ,p (G) we denote\nthe normal subgroup of G containing Op\u2032 (G) and satisfying\n(5.2)\n\nOp\u2032 ,p (G)/Op\u2032 (G) = Op (G/Op\u2032 (G)).\n\nSimilarly, we denote by Op\u2032 ,p,p\u2032 (G) the normal subgroup of G containing Op\u2032 ,p (G)\nsuch that\n(5.3)\n\nOp\u2032 ,p,p\u2032 (G)/Op\u2032 ,p (G) = Op\u2032 (G/Op\u2032 ,p (G)).\n\nThe finite group G will be called a p\u2032 pp\u2032 -sandwich group, if G = Op\u2032 ,p,p\u2032 (G). Note\nthat a p\u2032 pp\u2032 -sandwich group is p-soluble. One has the following property.\nProposition 5.4. Let G be a finite p\u2032 pp\u2032 -sandwich group, and let P \u2208 Sylp (G).\nThen NG (P ) controls p-fusion in G.\n\n\f12\n\nJ. GONZ\u00c1LEZ-S\u00c1NCHEZ AND T. S. WEIGEL\n\nProof. Let Q = Op\u2032 ,p (G) and M = Op\u2032 (G); in particular, P \u2264 Q. The Frattini\nargument yields that G = Q.NG (P ) = M.NG (P ). Put M\u25e6 = M \u2229 NG (P ). Then\none has a commutative diagram of finite groups\n(5.4)\n\n\u03b1\n/\nNG (P )\nuG\nMMM\nu\nu\nMMM\nuu\nM\nuu\u03b3\nu\n\u03b2 MMM\nzuu\n&\nNG (P )/M\u25e6\n\nand thus also a commutative diagram of homomorphism of Fp -algebras\n(5.5)\n\nH \u2022 (\u03b1)\n\nH \u2022 (NG (P ), Fp ) o\nH \u2022 (G, Fp )\niSSS\n6\nm\nm\nSSS\nmm\nm\nSSS\nm\nm\nS\nmmm \u2022\nH \u2022 (\u03b2) SSSS\nmmm H (\u03b3)\nH \u2022 (NG (P )/M\u25e6 , Fp )\n\nSince H \u2022 (\u03b2) and H \u2022 (\u03b3) are inflation mappings with respect to normal subgroups\nof p\u2032 -order, H \u2022 (\u03b2) and H \u2022 (\u03b3) are isomorphisms. Hence H \u2022 (\u03b1) = resG\nNG (P ) is an\nisomorphism. Thus by G. Mislin's theorem (see [17]), NG (P ) controls p-fusion in\nG.\n\u0003\nThe following lemma will turn out to be useful for our purpose.\nLemma 5.5. Let p be an odd prime, and let G be a finite p-soluble group. Assume\nfurther that Op\u2032 (G) = {1}, Op (G) 6= {1}, and that \u03a91 (Op (G)) is of exponent p.\nThen CentG (\u03a91 (Op (G)) \u2264 Op (G).\nProof. Put \u03a9 = \u03a91 (Op (G)) and C = CentG (\u03a9). Then Op (C) \u2264 Op (G), and\ntherefore \u03a91 (Op (C)) \u2264 \u03a9. Thus \u03a91 (Op (C)) \u2264 Z(\u03a9), and Op (C) is a non-trivial pcentral normal subgroup of G. Let M be the characteristic subgroup of C containing\nOp (C) such that M/Op (C) = Op\u2032 (C/Op (C)). Let H \u2264 M be a p\u2032 -Hall subgroup of\nM . Then H is acting trivially on \u03a91 (Op (C)), and thus on Op (C) (see [12, Kap. IV,\nSatz 5.12]). In particular, [H, Op (C)] = {1}, and therefore H = Op\u2032 (M ). Hence, as\n\u0003\nOp\u2032 (G) = {1}, H = {1}, and C = Op (C). This yields the claim.\nTheorem 5.6. Let p be odd, and let G be a finite p-soluble group containing a\nSylow p-subgroup P \u2208 Sylp (G) which is p-central of height p \u2212 2. Then P.Op\u2032 (G) is\nnormal in G. In particular, G is a p\u2032 pp\u2032 -sandwich group.\nProof. We may assume that Op\u2032 (G) = {1} and Op (G) 6= {1}. Let \u03a9 = \u03a91 (Op (G)).\nSince P is p-central of height p \u2212 2, \u03a9 is of exponent p. Thus by Lemma 5.5, one\nhas CentG (\u03a9) \u2264 Op (G).\n(1)\nLet M = gr\u2022 (\u03a9) denote the graded Fp [G]-module associated to the descending\np-central series of \u03a9 (see (2.2)), and let \u03c6M : G \u2212\u2192 GLFp (M ) denote the associated\nrepresentation for G. Let g \u2208 ker(\u03c6(M )) be an element of order co-prime to p.\nThen g \u2208 CentG (\u03a9) \u2264 Op (G). Hence g = 1, and ker(\u03c6M ) \u2264 Op (G). As P is\np-central of height p \u2212 2, one has for g \u2208 P that (\u03c6M (g) \u2212 idM )p\u22122 = 0. Hence\nker(\u03c6M ) = P by Lemma 5.3. This yields the claim.\n\u0003\nFrom Theorem 5.6 and Proposition 5.4 one concludes the following consequence\nwhich can be seen an analogue of J. Th\u00e9venaz's result.\n\n\fFINITE P-CENTRAL GROUPS OF HEIGHT K\n\n13\n\nCorollary 5.7. Let p be odd, and let G be a finite p-solvable group, for which\nP \u2208 Sylp (G) is p-central of height p \u2212 2. Then NG (P ) controls p-fusion in G.\n\nReferences\n[1] D. J.
