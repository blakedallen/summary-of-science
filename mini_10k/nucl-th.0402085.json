It has been shown both theoretically and experimentally that a properly\ndefined function (scaling function) depends only on a single variable y, the latter itself\nbeing a function of the transferred momentum q and energy \u03c9 (y = y(q, \u03c9)). It has been\nrealized that at momenta |q| > 500 MeV/c and energies \u03c9 at or below the quasielastic peak\nposition a nucleon is ejected in a \"quasifree\" way almost without the effects of the strong\ninteraction. This scaling is usually called scaling of the first kind. It was shown that the\nscaling function is sensitive to the high-momentum components of the spectral function and\nnucleon momentum distribution. Thus its knowledge can provide important information\nabout the dynamical ground-state properties, as well as about the reaction mechanism.\nThe comparison of the scaling functions of various nuclei with mass number A \u2265 4 led to\nthe conclusion that these functions are the same [7, 8]. This behaviour is called scaling of\nthe second kind which, together with scaling of the first kind, leads to superscaling. These\nstudies followed the theoretical concept of the superscaling introduced in [9, 10] considering\nthe properties of the relativistic Fermi gas (RFG) model. The analyses of a large body\nof inclusive scattering data for nuclei from A=4 to A=238 in [7, 8] demonstrated that the\ndata in the low-\u03c9 side of the quasielastic peak exhibit superscaling behaviour: the scaling\nfunctions are both independent on the momentum transfer and on the mass number. In\nthese analyses the Fermi momentum for the RFG was used as a physical scale to define the\nproper scaling variable \u03c8 \u2032 for each nucleus. An example of the superscaling behaviour of\nthe inclusive electron-scattering data for q \u2248 1000 MeV/c and for the 4 He,\nand\n\n197\n\n12\n\nC,\n\n27\n\nAl,\n\n56\n\nFe\n\nAu nuclei is given in Fig. 1 (the data are taken from Fig. 5 in [8]). An important\n\nconclusion has been drawn in [7, 8] that this universality is not restricted to the region\nof the quasielastic peak (|\u03c8 \u2032 | < 1) and that the superscaling extends to larger values of\n|\u03c8 \u2032 | and thus, to the high-momentum components of the nucleon momentum distributions\nin nuclei. The existence of high-momentum components, and their similarity for different\nnuclei, is known to be due to the short-range and tensor nucleon-nucleon correlations (see,\ne.g. [15, 16] and references therein).\nAn extended study of scaling of the first and second kinds for inclusive electron scattering\n2\n\n\ffrom nuclei with emphasis on the transverse response in the region above the quasielastic\npeak was performed in [11]. Approximate scaling of the second kind was observed and its\nmodest breaking was supposed to be due to an inelastic version of the usual scaling variable.\nIn [12] a unified relativistic approach used in the case of quasielastic kinematics was applied\nto the analysis of highly-inelastic electron scattering. The complete inelastic spectrum was\nconsidered using the inelastic RFG model and its phenomenological extension based on\ndirect fits to data, investigating the second-kind scaling behaviour as well.\nAs emphasized in [8], the actual dynamical physics content of the phenomenon considered\nis more complex than that provided by the RFG framework. In particular, as noticed there,\nthe extension of the superscaling property to large negative values of \u03c8 \u2032 (\u03c8 \u2032 < \u22121) is not\npredicted by the RFG model. This is seen in Fig. 1 where we also give a curve of the\ncalculated RFG scaling function which is equal to zero for \u03c8 \u2032 \u2264 \u22121. Thus, it is worth\nconsidering the superscaling in theoretical approaches which go beyond the RFG model.\nOne of them is the Coherent Density Fluctuation Model (CDFM) (e.g. [13, 14, 15, 16])\nwhich gives a natural extension of the Fermi-gas case to realistic finite nuclear systems. The\nmain aim of the present work is to see to what extent superscaling can be explained using\nthe CDFM. The theoretical scheme is given in Section II, while the results and the discussion\nare presented in Section III. The conclusions and the final remarks are given in Section IV.\n\nII.\n\nTHE THEORETICAL SCHEME\nA.\n\nBasic relationships of the CDFM\n\nThe CDFM was suggested [13] and developed [14, 15, 16, 17] as a model for studying\ncharacteristics of nuclear structure and nuclear reactions based on the local density and\nmomentum distributions as basic variables of the theory and using the essential results\nof the infinite nuclear matter theory. The model is related to the delta-function limit of\nthe generator coordinate method (GCM) [18]. In the latter the total many-particle wave\nfunction \u03a8({ri }) of a system of A nucleons is written in a form of a linear combination:\n\u03a8(r1 , ..., rA ) =\n\nZ\n\nF (x1 , x2 , ...)\u03a6(r1 , ..., rA ; x1 , x2 , ...)dx1 dx2 ...,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the generating function \u03a6({ri }; x1 , x2 , ...) depends on the radius-vectors of the nucleons {ri } (spin and isospin variables are implied) and on the generator coordinates x1 , x2 , ....\n3\n\n\fFIG. 1: Superscaling behaviour of inclusive electron-scattering. The grey area represents experimental data [8] for 4 He,\n\n12 C, 27 Al\n\nand 197 Au at q = 1000 MeV/c. The solid line is the RFG scaling\n\nfunction calculated using Eq. (24) with kF = 1.191 fm\u22121 from Ref. [8].\n\nThe function \u03a6 is usually chosen to be a Slater determinant built up from single-particle\nwave functions corresponding to a given construction potential parametrized by x1 , x2 , ....\nThe weight function F (x1 , x2 , ...) can be determined using the variational principle as a\nsolution of the Hill-Wheeler integral equation:\nZ\n\n[H(x, x\u2032 ) \u2212 EI(x, x\u2032 )]F (x\u2032 )dx\u2032 = 0.\n\n(2)\n\nIn (2) the overlap kernel I(x, x\u2032 ) and the energy kernel H(x, x\u2032 ) have the following forms,\nrespectively:\nI(x, x\u2032 ) = h\u03a6({ri }, x)|\u03a6({ri }, x\u2032 )i,\n\n(3)\n\nH(x, x\u2032 ) = h\u03a6({ri }, x)|\u0124|\u03a6({ri }, x\u2032 )i,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere i=1,2,...,A, \u0124 is the Hamiltonian of the system and x denotes a set of x1 , x2 , .... For\nmany-fermion systems the kernels I(x, x\u2032 ) and H(x, x\u2032 ) peak strongly at x \u223c x\u2032 [19, 20] and\ncan be written in the form:\nI(x, x\u2032 ) \u2243 I(x, x)G(x \u2212 x\u2032 ),\n\n(5)\n\nH(x, x\u2032 ) \u2243 H(x, x)G(x \u2212 x\u2032 ),\n\n(6)\n\n4\n\n\fwhere G is peaked at x \u223c x\u2032 . It was shown in [18] that the following delta-function approximation for the kernels is valid in the GCM for the case of many-fermion systems\nI(x, x\u2032 ) \u2192 \u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ),\nh\u03042 \u2032\u2032\nH(x, x ) \u2192 \u2212\n\u03b4 (x \u2212 x\u2032 ) + V\n2mef f\n\u2032\n\n(7)\n\nx + x\u2032\n\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 )\n2\n!\n\n(8)\n\nand that it leads to the Schr\u00f6dinger-type of equation [18, 19, 21] with an effective mass\ndependent on the generator coordinate (see also [16]).\nIn the following we use for simplicity only one generator coordinate. If the trial wave\nfunction \u03a8({ri }) in (1) is normalized to the mass number A and the weight function is\ndetermined under the condition\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n|F (x)|2 dx = 1,\n\n(9)\n\nthen the delta-function approximation (7) leads to the relationship:\nZ\n\n\u03a6\u2217 ({ri }, x\u2032 )\u03a6({ri }, x)dr1 ...drA = A\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ).\n\n(10)\n\nTaking into account Eqs. (5) and (10) it was suggested in the CDFM that a delta-function\napproximation leading to that of Eq. (10) holds in the case of many-fermion systems [14-16]:\nZ\n\n\u03a6\u2217 (r, r2 , ..., rA , x\u2032 )\u03a6(r\u2032 , r2 , ..., rA , x)dr2 ...drA \u223c\n= \u03c1x,x (r, r\u2032)\u03b4(x \u2212 x\u2032 ).\n\n(11)\n\nIn Eq.

(30) by means of the weight\nfunction |F (x)|2 determined from its relationship to the density distribution \u03c1(r) [Eq. (23)].\nFor the latter we used those obtained from experimental data on electron scattering from\nnuclei and muonic atoms.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS OF CALCULATIONS AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe calculated the scaling function f (\u03c8 \u2032 ) (30) for various nuclei and transfer momenta.\nA symmetrized diffused Fermi density distribution has been used for 4 He and\n\n12\n\nC [22] and\n\na diffused Fermi distribution for the heavier nuclei. The values of the half-radius R and\ndiffuseness parameter b are given in Table I together with the results for the CDFM Fermi\nmomentum kF (31).\nThe results for the scaling function are compared with the experimental data from [7, 8]\nwhich are given in our figures by a grey area. In Fig. 2 are presented the results for the\nscaling function in the CDFM for q=1000 MeV/c and for 4 He,\nvalues of the parameters R and b for 4 He and\n\n12\n\n12\n\nC,\n\n27\n\nAl and\n\n197\n\nAu. The\n\nC (given in Table 1) lead to charge rms\n\nradii 1.71 fm and 2.47 fm, respectively, which coincide with the experimental ones [23]. The\nvalues of R and b for\n\n27\n\nAl are taken from [23]. The results of the CDFM scaling function\n\n(solid lines) are compared with the RFG predictions (dotted lines).

(24), f (\u03c8 \u2032 ) = 0 for \u03c8 \u2032 \u2264 \u22121. As can be seen, the CDFM results\ngive a good agreement with the data for the interval for \u03c8 \u2032 from 0 till \u03c8 \u2032 < \u22121 for all nuclei\n(including\n\n56\n\nFe which is not shown). The only exception was observed for\n\n197\n\nAu using the\n\nvalues of the parameters R = 6.419 fm and b = 0.449 fm given in [24], for which the result\nis shown in Fig. 2 by dashed line.\nAt this point we would like to note that, generally, the weight function |F (x)|2 which is\nrelated to the density distribution [Eqs. (20) and (23)], is also related to the momentum\ndistribution [Eq. (21)]. This connects through Eq. (30) the scaling function f (\u03c8 \u2032 ) with\nn(k). The deviation of f (\u03c8 \u2032 ) from the data in the case of\n\n197\n\nAu (b = 0.449) is due to the\n\nparticular A-dependence of n(k) in the present approach [Eqs. (21),(23)].\nTo understand the origin of the agreement for light and medium nuclei, and of the discrepancy for\n\n197\n\nAu with b = 0.449 fm, we show in Fig. 3 the momentum distributions n(k)\n\n(21) (Fig. 3(a)) and the weight functions |F (x)|2 (Fig. 3(b)). As seen in Fig. 3(a), for the\n12\n\nC and\n\n40\n\nCa the CDFM momentum distributions depend weakly on A and have similar\n\nhigh-momentum (k > 1 fm\u22121 ) tails. Inspection of Eqs. (21) and (30) (which involve the\nsame weighting function |F (x)|2) shows that the interval of interest for \u03c8 \u2032 (\u22122 \u2264 \u03c8 \u2032 \u2264 0)\ncorresponds to the k interval 0 \u2264 k \u2264 \u22122.5 fm\u22121 in n(k). Thus the similar high-momentum\ntails of n(k) in the light (12 C) and medium (40 Ca) nuclei lead to the similar CDFM scaling\ncurves which are in agreement with the superscaling data.\nThe deviation between the CDFM scaling function and data in Fig. 2 for 197 Au (b = 0.449\nfm) takes place at \u03c8 \u2032 \u2264 \u22121 and corresponds to values of the momentum k \u2265 3 fm\u22121 . The\nCDFM high-momentum tail of\n\n197\n\nAu for b = 0.449 fm is much smaller than that of light\n\n9\n\n\fFIG. 2: Results for the scaling function in the CDFM (solid line) calculated using Eqs. (30) and\n(31) at q = 1000 MeV/c and for 4 He, 12 C, 27 Al and 197 Au (with b = 1.0 fm for the latter) compared\nwith the data (grey area) from [8]. The dotted line is the RFG result using Eq. (24). The dashed\nline in the case of\n\n197 Au\n\ncorresponds to the CDFM result with b = 0.449 fm.\n\nand medium nuclei (see Fig. 3(a)) causing the above mentioned deviation. In Fig. 3(b) we\ngive also the weight function |F (x)|2 calculated in the CDFM for 4 He,\n\n12\n\nC,\n\n40\n\nCa and\n\n197\n\nAu\n\nusing Eq. (23) and the corresponding density distributions mentioned above. As can be\nseen |F (x)|2 is a one-peak function which for 4 He,\n\n12\n\nC and\n\n40\n\nCa follows a particular trend\n\nwith increasing A. The strength of the peak decreases (consequently its width increases)\nwith increasing A, and the peak is displaced to higher x values. This trend is broken by the\nbehaviour of |F (x)|2 for\n\n197\n\nAu when we take b = 0.449 fm.\n\nTo improve the A-dependence of the momentum distribution in the CDFM for the heaviest nucleus, we use a procedure that may be somewhat artificial but which is useful to show\nthe role of the obtained, more realistic, new high-momentum components of n(k) on the\nscaling function. This can be achieved by taking an effective larger value of the parameter b\nin the diffuse Fermi density distribution which is used to obtain the weight function |F (x)|2\n10\n\n\fFIG. 3: (a) Nucleon momentum distribution n(k) calculated in the CDFM using Eqs. (21) and\n(23) for\n\n12 C, 40 Ca\n\nand\n\n197 Au\n\n(for the latter with b = 0.449 fm and b = 1.0 fm); (b) The weight\n\nfunction |F (x)|2 of the CDFM calculated using Eq.

We take the value b = 1.0 fm, for which the highmomentum components of n(k) in\nThis can be seen in Fig. 3(a) for\n\n197\n197\n\nAu are similar to those in light and medium nuclei.\n\nAu (solid line). The change of the behaviour of the\n\n11\n\n\fweight function |F (x)|2 which leads to this shape of n(k) for\n\n197\n\nAu can be seen in Fig. 3(b)\n\n(solid line). In this case the function |F (x)|2 follows the trend previously observed for light\nand medium nuclei of decreasing strength (increasing width) with increasing A. The values\nof |F (x)|2 for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 5.2 fm determine the behaviour of f (\u03c8 \u2032 ) for \u22121.5 < \u03c8 \u2032 < \u22121. As\ncan be seen from Fig. 3(b) in this region |F (x)|2 is quite different for b = 0.449 fm and for\nb = 1.0 fm. The results of the calculations of the scaling function for\n\n197\n\nAu with b = 1.0 fm\n\nare presented in Fig. 2 by a solid line and, as can be seen, they are in good agreement with\nthe data. This confirms the view that the behaviour of the scaling function is related to the\nproperties of the momentum distribution at large values of k (k > 1.5 fm\u22121 ), and that the\nsimilarity of the high-momentum tails of n(k) leads to the scaling of second kind.\nHere we would like to note that the use of an effective value of b for\n\n197\n\nAu can be merely\n\nseen as an artificial procedure to improve the A-dependence of n(k) for the heaviest nucleus.\nThis shows what would be the results of the CDFM for the scaling function when the highmomentum tails of n(k) are realistic, even for the heaviest nucleus, and are similar to those\nof light and medium nuclei. We do not imply that the actual diffuseness of the density\ndistribution of\n\n197\n\nAu should be that large. However, it is also worth pointing out that all\n\nthe nucleons may contribute to the scaling function for the transverse electron scattering\nand that the diffuseness of the mass density for a nucleus like 197 Au may be larger than that\nof the charge density.\nThe results for the scaling function in the CDFM in the case of q=1650 MeV/c are given\nin Fig. 4 for 4 He and\n\n197\n\nAu (the latter with improved high-momentum tail of n(k)) and\n\ncompared with the experimental data taken from Fig. 6 of [8]. The curves for\n\n12\n\nC and\n\n56\n\nFe\n\nare not given since they are similar, in agreement with the data.\nThe result for the scaling function in the CDFM in the case of q=500 MeV/c for\n\n12\n\nC is\n\ngiven in Fig. 5. This result is also in good agreement with the experimental data for q in\nthe interval from 500 to 600 MeV/c given in Fig. 8 of [8].\nOne can see in Figs. 2 and 4 that the CDFM results tend to overestimate the data in the\ninterval \u22121 \u2264 \u03c8 \u2032 \u2264 \u22120.5. We note that the origin of this is related to the predictions of the\nRFG model in the same region, as can be seen in Fig. 1.\n\n12\n\n\fFIG. 4: Results of the CDFM for the superscaling functions of 4 He (solid line) and\n\n197 Au\n\n(dashed\n\nline) at q = 1650 MeV/c compared with the experimental data (grey area) from [8].\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS\n\nThe results of the present work can be summarized as follows:\ni) We propose an extension of the RFG model to calculate the scaling function f (\u03c8 \u2032 ) in\nfinite nuclei within the Coherent Density Fluctuation Model (CDFM). In this model f (\u03c8 \u2032)\nis a weighted superposition of scaling functions for relativistic Fermi gases with different\ndensities. The weight function is calculated using the known charge density distributions in\nnuclei.\nii) We calculate the scaling function f (\u03c8 \u2032 ) for inclusive electron scattering for 4 He,\n27\n\nAl,\n\n56\n\n12\n\nC,\n\nFe and 197 Au nuclei and for various values of the transfer momentum |q|=1650, 1000\n\nand 500 MeV/c. The results agree with the available experimental data at different transferred momenta, and energies below the quasielastic peak position, showing superscaling for\nnegative values of \u03c8 \u2032 including also those smaller than -1. This is an improvement over the\nRFG model predictions where the scaling function becomes abruptly zero beyond |\u03c8 \u2032 | = \u22121.\niii) The sensitivity of the scaling function to the high-momentum components of the\n\n13\n\n\fFIG. 5: Results of the CDFM for the superscaling function of\n\n12 C\n\nat q = 500 MeV/c (solid line)\n\ncompared with the experimental data (grey area) for q in the interval from 500 to 600 MeV/c from\n[8].\n\nmomentum distribution is analyzed in detail, especially so on the example of the\n\n197\n\nAu\n\nnucleus.\niv) The scaling function obtained is symmetrical around \u03c8 \u2032 = 0 up to |\u03c8 \u2032 | = (4ckF )\u22121 .\nIt would also be interesting to search for models predicting an assymetrical superscaling\nfunction f (\u03c8 \u2032 ) as the phenomenological one obtained by [25] and discussed in Ref. [12].\nIt is shown in our work that the superscaling in nuclei can be explained quantitatively\non the basis of the similar behaviour of the high-momentum components of n(k) in light,\nmedium and heavy nuclei which is known to be due to the short-range and tensor correlations\nin nuclei. This suggests an alternative path for defining the weight function F (x) within the\ngenerator coordinate method: a path in which F (x) is built up from a phenomenological or\na theoretical momentum distribution.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nOne of the authors (A.N.A.) is grateful for warm hospitality to the Faculty of Physics\nof the Complutense University of Madrid and for support during his stay there to the\nState Secretariat of Education and Universities of Spain (N.Ref.SAB2001-0030).
