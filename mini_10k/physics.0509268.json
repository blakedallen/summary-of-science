In a Lagrangian treatment the path X(t, y) and the velocity U(t, y) of advected particles initially starting at\nthe position y are determined by the acceleration A(t, y) which in principle is given by the Navier-Stokes equation:\ndX(t, y)\n= U(t, y)\ndt\ndU(t, y)\n= A(t, y)\ndt\n\n,\n.\n\n(1)\n\nThe central statistical quantity is the joint position-velocity probability distribution of the particle:\nf (u, x, t) = < \u03b4(x \u2212 (X(t, y) \u2212 U(0, y)t \u2212 y))\u03b4(u \u2212 (U(t, y) \u2212 U(0, y)) >\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the brackets denote a suitable average over a stationary statistical ensemble. Here and in the following we\nshall be interested in the statistics of increments u(t) = U(t, y) \u2212 U(0, y), x(t) = X(t, y) \u2212 U(0, t)t \u2212 y. The pdf (2)\nobeys the initial condition, f (u, x, 0) = \u03b4(u)\u03b4(x). Furthermore, Kolmogorov's theory of 1941 (K41) [1] suggests the\nexistence of scaling behaviour\n1\nu x\nf0 ( \u221a , \u221a 3 )\nt6\nt\nt\n\nf (u, x, t) =\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nAlthough such a scaling behaviour may not exist due to intermittency [2] the assumption of normal scaling behaviour\n(3) usually serves as a first starting point.\nDue to the fact that a successfull statistical approach based on a treatment of the Navier-Stokes equation is still\nmissing, one has to resort to heuristic assumptions about the statistics of A(t, y). An early model for f (u, x, t) has\nbeen introduced by Obukhov [4], who assumed, that the turbulent acceleration A(t, y) is a Gaussian, \u03b4-correlated\nrandom force:\n< Ai (t, y)Aj (t\u2032 , y) > = 2\u03b4ij \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nIn turn the probability distribution (2) obeys a Fokker-Planck equation:\n\u2202\nf (u, x, t) + u * \u2207x f (u, x, t) = \u2206u f (u, x, t)\n\u2202t\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nThe solution of the Obukhov-model with the initial condition f (u, x, 0) = \u03b4(x)\u03b4(u) possess a Gaussian form\nexhibiting scaling behaviour\n< u2 (t) >\u223c t\n\n,\n\n< x2 (t) >\u223c t3\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhich is consistent with the phenomenological scaling theory of Kolmogorov (K41). However Obukhov's model\ncontradicts recent experimental results [5], [6]: the probability distribution for the velocity increment is far from\n\n\f2\nGaussian and the increment behaviour can not be a simple random walk as suggested by Obukhov. The reason is\nthe intermittent character of turbulent flows. Nonnormal statistics for Lagrangian variables may originate from long\ntime correlations in the turbulent field. During the last few years lots of efforts have been put into the formulation\nof more sophisticated phenomenological theories which can take into account these facts (c.f. the review article [7]).\nRecently a connection between the velocity increment statistics of a Lagrangian particle and a type of continuous\ntime random walk has been introduced [8] by a truncation of an infinite chain of evolution equations for multiple\nparticle probability distributions. The following evolution equation for the single time joint position velocity increment\nprobability distribution has been obtained\nZ t\n1 \u2202\n\u2202\ndt\u2032\n\u2207u Q(u2 )[\u2207u f (u, x \u2212 u(t \u2212 t\u2032 ), t\u2032 )]u\u2032 =u\n,\n{ + u * \u2207x }f (u, x, t) =\n\u2202t\n\u0393(\u03b1) \u2202t 0 (t \u2212 t\u2032 )1\u2212\u03b1\nui uj\nQij (u2 ) = u2(1\u2212\u03b1) [\u03b4ij Q1 + Q2 2 ]\n.\n(7)\nu\n(\u0393(\u03b1) denotes the Gamma- function). In the case of isotropic turbulent flows, the matrix Qij (u2 ) has to be invariant\nwith respect to rotations leading to the form given above. Furthermore, the variables Q1 and Q2 are constant due\nto the fact that solutions of the above equation are required to allow for scaling behaviour of the velocity increment\nu \u2248 t1/2 (for constant value of \u03b1). The parameter \u03b1 is taken from the interval 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1. This equation generalizes\nObukhov's model in several respects. First, it introduces a temporal memory. Second, the simple diffusion process\nin velocity space is changed to a diffusion process with velocity dependent diffusion coefficient. Third, retardation\neffects with respect to the spatial\ncoordinate appear. It has been shown that solutions of the resulting equation for\nR\nthe velocity pdf G(u, t) = dxf (u, x, t) yields excellent approximations to the experimentally determined velocity\npdf's, provided the parameter \u03b1 is allowed to vary with the time increment. A complete solution to the equation (7)\nhas not yet been obtained.\nIn the present paper we investigate a simpler phenomenological model by disregarding the retardation in the spatial\ncoordinate:\n\u2202\n{ + u * \u2207x }f (u, x, t) = 0 D1\u2212\u03b1\nL(u, \u2207u )f (u, x, t) + \u03b4(t)\u03b4(x)\u03b4(u)\n.\n(8)\nt\n\u2202t\nHere, L(u, \u2207u ) is a diffusion operator with a velocity dependent diffusion constant (compare eq. (7)). We have\nexplicitly included the initial condition. The operator 0 Dt1\u2212\u03b1 denotes the Riemann-Liouville fractional differential\noperator (see e.g. [15]):\nZ t\n1 \u2202\nF (t\u2032 )\n1\u2212\u03b1\nF (t) =\ndt\u2032\n.\n(9)\n0 Dt\n\u0393(\u03b1) \u2202t 0 (t \u2212 t\u2032 )1\u2212\u03b1\nThis is a straightforward generalization of integer order differentiation to fractional orders. The presence of the\nfractional differential operator eq.(9) introduces temporal memory effects depending on the parameter \u03b1. We assume\nthat 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1. In the limit \u03b1 \u2192 1 our model eq.(8) reduces to the ordinary Obukhov model eq.(5) due to the\nproperty 0 Dt0 F (t) = F (t) if one takes L(u, \u2207u ) to be the diffusion operator L = \u2206u .\nThe purpose of the present paper is not to state the accurate evolution equation for the Lagrangian position-velocity\nincrement. This task has to be performed on the basis of a theoretical analysis of the Navier-Stokes equation, as has\nbeen started in [8], or by sophisticated data analysis of the experimentally obtained Lagrangian path's of particles.\nAn assessment of the underlying stochastic process, in our opinion, has to include the description of multiple time\ndistributions. Such an analysis for a class of continuous time random walks has recently been started [9]. The purpose\nof the present paper is to consider an extension of Obukhov's model to a class of fractional diffusion equations, whose\nstudy quite seemingly is interesting by its own. It is hoped that the obtained results contribute to a more detailed\nunderstanding of Lagrangian turbulence statistics.\nThe paper is outlined as follows. In the next section we focus on the probability distribution for the velocity\nincrement and review how it can be determined by methods developed in the theory of continuous time random walks\n(for a recent review of the topic we refer the reader to [10], [11]). In section III we shall show that the joint position\nvelocity pdf can be expressed as an integral transform\nZ\nZ \u221e\nf (u, x, t) = dz\ndsh(z, x; s, t)f1 (u, z, s)\n,\n(10)\n0\n\nwhere f1 (u, x, s) is the solution of eq. (8) for \u03b1 = 1 and h(z, x; s, t) a positive function. Special emphasis is put\nonto the case of L(u, \u2207u ) = \u2206u . Here, the statistics of the velocity is characterized by subdiffusive behaviour related\nto temporal memory effects. It is shown that both velocity and position of the particle reveal anomalous diffusive\nproperties. We explicitly determine the probability distributions of velocity and spatial coordinate. For a diffusion\noperator L(u, \u2207u ) which allows for scaling solutions f (u, x, s) we discuss how normal scaling behaviour < u2 (t) >\u223c t\nmay arise in connection with nonnormal statistics.\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nTHE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE VELOCITY INCREMENT\n\nAfter integration over the\nR position variable in eq. (8) an evolution equation for the marginal probability distribution\nof the velocity G(u, t) = dxf (u, x, t) is obtained in the form of the fractional diffusion equation:\n\u2202\nG(u, t) = 0 Dt1\u2212\u03b1 L(u, \u2207u )G(u, t) + \u03b4(t)\u03b4(u)\n\u2202t\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nIf we take L(u, \u2207u ) = \u2206u we obtain the fractional diffusion equation for a continuous time random walk [10], [11].\nAccordingly the second order moment reveals subdiffusive characteristics: < u2 (t) >\u223c t\u03b1 . The corresponding pdf is\nwell-known and will be given below.\nThe solution of the fractional diffusion equation (11) is conveniently expressed as an integral transform [12], [13]\nZ \u221e\nG(u, t) =\nds h\u03b1 (s, t)G1 (u, s)\n,\n(12)\n0\n\nin which the function G1 (u, s) is obtained as solution of the ordinary diffusion equation (11) with \u03b1 = 1 and the\nintegral kernel h\u03b1 (s, t) is given as the single time probability distribution of an inverse L\u00e9vy-stable process [12], [13]:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nt\nt\nh\u03b1 (s, t) =\nL\u03b1\n.\n(13)\n\u03b1 s1+1/\u03b1\ns1/\u03b1\nHere L\u03b1 (t) denotes a one-sided L\u00e9vy-stable distribution of order \u03b1. This may be shown by inserting the ansatz (12)\ninto eq. (11) leading to the solvability conditions\n\u2202\n\u2202\nh\u03b1 (s, t) = \u22120 Dt1\u2212\u03b1 h\u03b1 (s, t)\n\u2202t\n\u2202s\n1\u2212\u03b1\nh\u03b1 (0, t) = \u03b4(t)\n.\n0 Dt\n\n,\n(14)\n\nThese two equations determine h\u03b1 (s, t) in the form eq.(13). The properties of the diffusion operator L(u, \u2207u ) enter\nvia the pdf G1 (u, t). The form of the pdf, eq. (12) has the following interpretation. There is a usual diffusion process\nw(s) described by a Fokker-Planck operator L(w, \u2207w ) with respect to an intrinsic time s. Additionally, there is a\nprozess s = s(t) relating physical time t and intrinsic time s with a probability distribution h\u03b1 (s, t). The random\nprocess u(t) is given by u(t) = w(s(t)).\nIII.\n\nSOLUTION OF THE GENERALIZED OBUKHOV-MODEL\n\nMotivated by the results for the fractional diffusion equation we look for solutions of eq.(8) which can be expressed\nas an integral transform similar to eq.(12):\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nf (u, x, t) =\ndz\nds h(z, x; s, t)f1 (u, z, s)\n.\n(15)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n0\n\nf1 (u, z, s) denotes the solution of the ordinary Obukhov-model eq.(8) specified by \u03b1 = 1:\n\u2202\nf1 (u, x, s) + u * \u2207x f1 (u, x, s) = L(u, \u2207u )f1 (u, x, s)\n\u2202s\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nThe structure of the pdf, eq. (15), has the following interpretation. Let us consider the case L = \u2206u . There is a\nstochastic process with respect to the intrinsic time s given by\ndz\n= u(s)\n,\nds\ndw\n= F(w, s)\nds\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nFurthermore, there is a process s(t) relating physical time t and intrinsic time s. The velocity u(t), thereby, is given\nby u(t) = w(s(t)). If the space variable x(t) would be obtained via x(t) = z(s(t)) the function h would not depend\n\n\f4\non x and z and would be simply given by the function h\u03b1 (s, t) of the preceding section. However, the space variable\nx(t) is defined by the relationship\ndx(t)\n= u(t)\ndt\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nThis explains the fact why h(z, x; s, t) depends on the two spatial variables x, z but not on the velocity u.\nIn the following we shall derive a fractional differential equation for h(z, x; s, t), corresponding boundary conditions\nand obtain an explicit solution. We proceed as follows: the ansatz eq.(15) is substituted into the evolution equation\n(8). The operator L(u, \u2207u ) only acts on f1 (u, z, s) such that eq.(16) can be applied:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u2202\nds\ndz\n+ u * \u2207x h(z, x; s, t)f1 (u, z, s)\n\u2202t\n0\n\u2212\u221e\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u2202\n= 0 Dt1\u2212\u03b1\nds h(z, x; s, t)\ndz\n(19)\n+ u * \u2207z f1 (u, z, s) + \u03b4(t)\u03b4(u)\u03b4(x).\n\u2202s\n0\n\u2212\u221e\nIn the integral on the right hand side we perform a partial integration with respect to z and s. Since f1 (u, z, s)\nvanishes for |z| \u2192 \u221e the following boundary terms are obtained:\n\u0014\n\u0015s=\u221e\nZ \u221e\n1\u2212\u03b1\ndzh(z, x, s, t)f1 (u, z, s)\n(20)\n0 Dt\ns=0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nWe can assume h(z, x; s = \u221e, t) = 0.\nLet us consider the boundary term using the initial condition f1 (u, z, s = 0) = \u03b4(u)\u03b4(z). In that case, the boundary\nterm (20) yields:\n\u0014\n\u0015s=\u221e\nZ \u221e\n1\u2212\u03b1\ndzh(z, x; s, t)f1 (u, z, s)\n= \u22120 Dt1\u2212\u03b1 h(0, x; 0, t)\u03b4(u) = \u2212\u03b4(x)\u03b4(u)\u03b4(t)\n.\n(21)\n0 Dt\ns=0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThis term cancels the last term on the right hand side of (19) provided we postulate the validity of the boundary\ncondition\n1\u2212\u03b1\nh(z\n0 Dt\n\n= 0, x; s = 0, t) = \u03b4(t)\u03b4(x)\n\n.\n\nAs a consequence, the function h(z, x; s, t) has to obey the following equation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1\u2212\u03b1\n+ u * \u2207x h(z, x; s, t) = \u2212 0 Dt\n+ u * \u2207z h(z, x; s, t)\n\u2202t\n\u2202s\n1\u2212\u03b1\nh(z\n0 Dt\n\n= 0, x; s = 0, t) = \u03b4(t)\u03b4(x)\n\n.\n\n(22)\n\n,\n(23)\n\nThis is the generalization of eq. (14).\nWe have to add the following remarks. First, equation (23) determines the u-independent function h(z, x; s, t)\nby a relation including the velocity u. The fact that there is no u-dependence has been crucial for arriving at the\nequations (23). Below, we shall show that we actually can find a u-independent solution. Second, we point out that\nthe properties of the diffusion operator L(u, \u2207u ) do not show up in the determination of the function h(z, x; s, t). The\nproperties of this operator are included in the pdf f (u, z, s) and we have obtained the solution in terms of an integral\ntransform for a large class of stochastic processes.\nA.\n\nDetermination of h(z, x; s, t)\n\nThe solution of differential equations containing the Riemann-Liouville fractional differential operator is simplified\nby changing to Laplace-space. This is due to the fact that the integral in the definition eq.(9) is actually\nR \u221e a Laplaceconvolution. Throughout this discussion we denote Laplace-transforms as follows: F\u0303 (\u03bb) := L{F (t)} := 0 dte\u2212\u03bbt F (t).\nBy performing a Laplace-transformation of eq.(23) we derive the following first order partial differential equation:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n1\u2212\u03b1\n(\u03bb + u * \u2207x ) h\u0303(z, x; s, \u03bb) \u2212 h(z, x; s, 0) = \u2212 \u03bb\n+ u * \u2207z h\u0303(z, x; s, \u03bb)\n\u2202s\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202\n+\n.\n(24)\n+ u * \u2207z 0 Dt1\u2212\u03b1 h(z, x; s, t) t=0\n\u2202s\n\n\f5\nThe last term on\n\u0002 the right hand \u0003side is due to the partial time derivative in the fractional differential operator. It can\nbe set to zero: 0 Dt\u2212\u03b1 h(z, x; s, t) t=0 = 0. Equation (24) is valid for s > 0. For s = 0 we have the boundary condition\nh(z, x; s, 0) = \u03b4(z \u2212 x)\u03b4(s). Thus we obtain the final form of the evolution equation for h\u0303(z, x; s, \u03bb):\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u2202\n.\n(25)\n+ u * \u2207z + \u03bb\u03b1\u22121 u * \u2207x h\u0303(z, x; s, \u03bb) = \u2212\u03bb\u03b1 h\u0303(z, x; s, \u03bb)\n\u2202s\nLinear partial differential equations of this type can be solved by the method of characteristics (see e.g. [16]). This\nmethod will be applied below.\nIf we choose s as parameter of the characteristics, eq.(25) can be written as\n\u001b\n\u001a\nd\ndz(s)\ndx(s)\n\u2202\nh\u0303(z(s), x(s); \u03bb, s) =\n+\n* \u2207z +\n* \u2207x h\u0303(z(s), x(s); \u03bb, s)\nds\n\u2202s\nds\nds\n= \u2212\u03bb\u03b1 h\u0303(z(s), x(s); \u03bb, s)\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nClearly the solution of this differential equation reads\n\u03b1\n\nh\u0303(z(s), x(s); \u03bb, s) = h\u0303(z(0), x(0); \u03bb, 0) e\u2212\u03bb\n\ns\n\n.\n\n(27)\n\nThe characteristics z(s), x(s) are determined by ordinary first order differential equations:\ndz(s)\n= u\nds\ndx(s)\n= \u03bb\u03b1\u22121 u\nds\n\n\u2192\n\nz(s) = us + z0\n\n,\n\n\u2192\n\nx(s) = \u03bb\u03b1\u22121 us + x0\n\n.\n\n(28)\n\nFor the initial condition h\u0303(z(0), x(0); 0, \u03bb) = h\u0303(z0 , x0 ; 0, \u03bb) we specify a sharp distribution at x0 . The dependence\non \u03bb is chosen as \u03bb\u03b1\u22121 to be consistent with the boundary condition (23). If we put z0 = 0 the inital condition takes\nthe form:\nh\u0303(z0 = 0, x0 ; 0, \u03bb) = \u03b4(x0 )\u03bb\u03b1\u22121 = \u03b4(x \u2212 \u03bb\u03b1\u22121 z)\u03bb\u03b1\u22121\n\n.\n\n(29)\n\nFinally we obtain the kernel of the transformation eq.(15) as solution of the partial differential equation (25) in\nLaplace-space:\n\u03b1\n\nh\u0303(z, x; s, \u03bb) = \u03b4(x \u2212 \u03bb\u03b1\u22121 z)\u03bb\u03b1\u22121 e\u2212\u03bb\n\ns\n\n= \u03b4(x \u2212 \u03bb\u03b1\u22121 z)h\u0303\u03b1 (s, \u03bb)\n\n.\n\n(30)\n\n\u03b1\n\nIn the last step we substitute the Laplace-transform of h\u03b1 (s, t): L{h\u03b1 (s, t)} = \u03bb\u03b1\u22121 e\u2212\u03bb s .\nFrom this expression the integral kernel in physical time h(z, x; s, t) is given as inverse Laplace-transform:\nh(z, x; s, t) = L\u22121 {\u03b4(x \u2212 \u03bb\u03b1\u22121 z)} \u2217 h\u03b1 (s, t)\n\n.\n\n(31)\n\nThe asterisk \u2217 denotes a Laplace-convolution with respect to t. However due to the \u03bb-dependence of the \u03b4-function a\nclosed form of the inverse transformation L\u22121 {\u03b4(x \u2212 \u03bb\u03b1\u22121 z)} could not be calculated and the explicit expression of\nh(z, x; s, t) remains unknown.\nStill the transformation eq.(15) provides a useful equation for characterizing the solution f (u, x, t). Since inverse\nLaplace-transform and integration commute we can give an expression for the transformed solution f \u0303(u, x, \u03bb) :=\nL{f (u, x, t)}:\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n \u0303\nds h\u0303(z, x; s, \u03bb)f1 (u, z, s)\n.\n(32)\ndz\nf (u, x, \u03bb) =\n\u2212\u221e\n\n0\n\nThus statistical quantities can be calculated in Laplace-space and then transformed to physical time. It will become\nclear in the following that with the help of the integral kernel h\u0303(z, x; s, \u03bb) the solution of the generalized Obukhovmodel can be completely characterized.\nHowever, several remarks are in order. First of all, one can easily check that the solutions f (u, x, t) of eq.(8) are\nnormalized:\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\ndu f (u, t) = 1\n.\n(33)\ndu f (u, x, t) =\ndx\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\f6\nAdditionally one states that h\u0303(z, x; s, \u03bb) is always nonegative and so are h(z, x; s, t), f1 (u, z, s), and, in turn, f (u, x, t).\nThis proofs that the generalized Oboukhov model actually defines a probability distribution for the case 0 < \u03b1 < 1.\nSecond, we have to show that the above assumptions are fullfilled. To this end we note that the quantity h(z, x; s, t)\nin fact is independent on the velocity u. Furthermore, we have the relationship\nh\u0303(0, x; s, \u03bb) = \u03b4(x)h\u0303\u03b1 (s, \u03bb)\n\n,\n\n(34)\n\nwhich in real space reads\n1\u2212\u03b1\nh(0, x; 0, t)\n0 Dt\n\n= \u03b4(x)0 Dt1\u2212\u03b1 h\u03b1 (0, t) = \u03b4(x)\n\n.\n\n(35)\n\nh(z, x; s, 0) = L\u22121 {\u03b4(x \u2212 \u03bb\u03b1\u22121 z)} \u2217 \u03b4(s) \u223c \u03b4(s)\n\n.\n\n(36)\n\nSince h\u03b1 (s, 0) = \u03b4(s) we obtain\n\nThe case \u03b1 = 1 has to lead to the ordinary Obukhov model. Evidently the integral kernel eq.(30) in this limit is given\nby the Laplace transform\nh\u0303(z, x; s, \u03bb) = \u03b4(x \u2212 z)e\u2212\u03bbs\n\n.\n\n(37)\n\nThe inverse Laplace-transformation is easily calculated:\nh(z, x; s, t) = \u03b4(x \u2212 z)\u03b4(t \u2212 s)\n\n,\n\n(38)\n\nsuch that the transformation eq.(15) leads to the solution of the ordinary Obukhov-model.\nThe second limit case is supposed to yield the solution G(u, t) of the fractional diffusion equation.\ning the integration of eq.(32) with respect to x results in:\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u03b1\u22121\ndx\ndz\nds \u03b4(x \u2212 \u03bb\nz)h\u0303\u03b1 (s, \u03bb)f1 (u, z, s) =\nds h\u0303\u03b1 (s, \u03bb)G1 (u, s) .\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n0\n\nPerform(39)\n\n0\n\nThe right hand side of this equation is the Laplace-transform of the solution eq.(12) of the fractional diffusion equation\n(11). The agreement in this case is achieved due to the choice \u03bb\u03b1\u22121 in the initial condition eq.(29).\nB.\n\nThe joint probability distribution f (u, x, t)\n\nIn the following we derive a formal expression for the joint probability distribution h\u0303(z, x; s, \u03bb). First the Laplacetransform of f (u, x, t) is calculated using the transformation eq.(32):\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nf (u, x, \u03bb) =\ndz\nds \u03b4(x \u2212 \u03bb\u03b1\u22121 z)h\u0303\u03b1 (s, \u03bb)f1 (u, z, s)\n\u2212\u221e\n0\nZ \u221e\n.\n(40)\nds \u03bbd(1\u2212\u03b1) h\u0303\u03b1 (s, \u03bb)f1 (u, \u03bb1\u2212\u03b1 x, s)\n=\n0\n\nHere the integration with respect to z is performed in d dimensions. Let us assume that the diffusion operator\nL(u, \u2207u ) allows for solutions exhibiting scaling behaviour of the form\nf1 (u, z, s) =\n\nu\n1\nz\nH( 1+\u03b4 , \u03b4 )\ns\ns\ns(1+2\u03b4)d\n\n(41)\n\nThis yields:\nf (u, x, \u03bb) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nds \u03bbd(1\u2212\u03b1) h\u0303\u03b1 (s, \u03bb)\n\n1\ns(1+2\u03b4)d\n\nH(\n\n\u03bb1\u2212\u03b1 x u\n, )\ns1+\u03b4 s\u03b4\n\n.\n\nLet us consider the case of the simple diffusion operator L = \u2206. f1 (u, z, s) is then explicitly given as:\n\u221a !d\n\u001b\n\u001a\nu2\n3z * u 3z2\n3\nf1 (u, z, s) =\n.\nexp\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n2\u03c0s2\ns\ns2\ns3\n\n(42)\n\n(43)\n\nThis pdf exhibits scaling behaviour of the form (41) with \u03b4 = 1/2.\nWe have not determined the Laplace inversion of this formula. However, we shall obtain the probability distributions\nfor the velocity u and the spatial variable x.\n\n\f7\nC.\n\nThe probability distribution G(x, t)\n\nWe shall start with the probability distribution G(u, t) for the velocity u which is obtained by an integration with\nrespect to the spatial variable x:\nZ\nG(u, t) = dxf (u, x, t)\n.\n(44)\nIn Laplace space, we obtain\nG\u0303(u, \u03bb) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u03b1\n\nds\u03bb\u03b1\u22121 e\u2212\u03bb s G1 (u, s)\n\n,\n\n(45)\n\n0\n\nwhich, by Laplace inversion, yields\nG(u, t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndsh\u03b1 (s, t)G1 (u, s)\n\n.\n\n(46)\n\n0\n\nIf we assume that the function G1 (u, s) exhibits scaling behaviour,\nG1 (u, s) =\n\nu\n1\ng( )\nsd\u03b4 s\u03b4\n\n,\n\n(47)\n\nthe result may be reexpressed in a form which just evidences this scaling behaviour\nZ\n1\nu\n1\nu\nG(u, t) = d\u03c3h\u03b1 (\u03c3) d\u03b4\u03b1 g( \u03b4\u03b1 \u03c3 \u03b1\u03b4 ) = d\u03b4\u03b1 g\u0303( \u03b4\u03b1 )\n.\nt\nt\nt\nt\nLet us consider the case for L = \u2206u .

First of all, it represents a probability distribution as a superposition of\npdf's G1 (x, s) with different variances. Such a representation has been introduced by Castain et al. [12] in a description\nof the intermittent behaviour of the Eulerian velocity increment pdf. Second, scaling behaviour < u2 (t) >\u223c t is quite\noften related to a random walk behaviour in velocity space. However, the formula (48) shows that such scaling\nbehaviour may also arise for the cases [8] where the scaling indices \u03b1, \u03b4 are related by\n\u03b4\u03b1 =\n\n1\n2\n\n.\n\n(51)\n\nThis e.g. happens for the rotationally symmetric solutions of the diffusion operator\nL(u, \u2207u ) = \u2207(u2 )(1\u2212\u03b1) \u2207\n\n.\n\n(52)\n\nHere, the pdf G(u, s) is given by\nG(u, s) = N (\u03b1)\n\n1\ns\n\nd\n2\u03b1\n\nu2\u03b1\n\ne\u2212 4\u03b12 s\n\n(53)\n\nThese solutions have been shown to yield accurate reconstructions of the velocity increment pdf for turbulent flows\nmeasured in [5] by adjusting the parameter \u03b1 [8]. For the case of turbulent flows, the determination of the parameter\n\u03b1 and especially its time dependence is an open problem.\n\n\f8\nD.\n\nThe probability distribution F (x, t)\n\nLet us now turn to the probability distribution F (x, t) for the position x. This distribution is obtained from the\njoint pdf f (u, x, t) by integration with respect to the velocity variable:\nZ\nF (x, t) = duf (u, x, t)\n.\n(54)\nThe Laplace transform of this quantity can be determined from (40)\nZ \u221e\nF (x, \u03bb) =\nds\u03bbd(1\u2212\u03b1) h\u03b1 (s, \u03bb)F1 (\u03bb1\u2212\u03b1 x, s)\n\n.\n\n(55)\n\n0\n\nIf we consider a system exhibiting scaling behaviour,\nF1 (z, s) =\n\nz\n1\nF(\n)\nsd(1+\u03b4) s(1+\u03b4)\n\n,\n\n(56)\n\nwe may perform the transformation\nS = s\u03bb\u2212(1\u2212\u03b1)/(1+\u03b4)\n\n(57)\n\nleading to\nF (x, \u03bb) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndS\u03bb(1\u2212\u03b1)/(1+\u03b4) h\u03b1 (S\u03bb(1\u2212\u03b1)/(1+\u03b4) , \u03bb)\n\n0\n\n1\nx\nF(\n)\nS d(1+\u03b4) S (1+\u03b4)\n\nLaplace inversion yields the probability distribution\nZ \u221e\n1\nx\nF (x, t) =\ndS d(1+\u03b4) F ( (1+\u03b4) )h \u03b4\u03b1+1 (s, t)\n\u03b4+1\nS\nS\n0\n\n.\n\n(58)\n\n.\n\n(59)\n\nThe decisive step thereby, is the possibility to calculate the Laplace inverse of the function\n\u03b1\u03b4+1\n\n\u03b1\u03b4+1\n\nL\u22121 {\u03bb(1\u2212\u03b1)/(1+\u03b4) h\u03b1 (S\u03bb(1\u2212\u03b1)/(1+\u03b4) , \u03bb)} = L\u22121 {\u03bb 1+\u03b4 \u22121 e\u2212 1+\u03b4 S }\n\u03b4+1\nt\nt\n=\n1+\u03b4 L \u03b1\u03b4+1 (\n1+\u03b4 ) = h \u03b4\u03b1+1 (s, t)\n1+\n\u03b4+1\n\u03b1\u03b4 + 1 s \u03b1\u03b4+1 1+\u03b4 s \u03b1\u03b4+1\nWe can now explicitly state the result for the diffusion operator L = \u2206u :\n!d\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\n3x2\n3\nt\nt\n3\n\u2212 4S\n3\nL(2+\u03b1)/3\nF (x, t) =\ndSe\n3\n3/(2+\u03b1)\n1+3/(2+\u03b1)\n4\u03c0S\n2+\u03b1\nS\nS\n0\n\n.\n\n.\n\n(60)\n\n(61)\n\nOne observes that the limiting case \u03b1 = 1 leads to pdf of the Obukhov model. Furthermore, it is evident that the\nprobability distribution of the spatial variable x is given by an expression similar to the one obtained for the velocity\nvariable in form of an integral transform:\nr\nZ\n2+\u03b1\n3x2\n3\nF (x, t) = d\u03c3L(2+\u03b1)/3 (\u03c3)(\n.\n(62)\n)d \u03c3 3(2+\u03b1)/2 e\u2212 4t2+\u03b1 \u03c3\n2+\u03b1\n4\u03c0t\nThis expression has to be compared with the one obtained for the pdf of the velocity (50).\nWe mention that the solution (58) can be related to a continuous time random walk for the position increment x(t)\nof a Lagrangian particle. Continuous time random walks for the description of the distance between two Lagrangian\nvariables in connection with Richardson's law have been discussed by Shlesinger et al. [17].\nE.\n\nMoments of the generalized Obukhov-model\n\nStarting from eq.(40) we can derive a general relation for moments of arbitrary order of the joint probability\ndistribution f (u, x, t).\nSingle-time moments < xni (t)um\ni (t) > are defined as follows:\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n< xni (t)um\n(t)\n>\n=\ndu\ndx xni um\n.\n(63)\ni\ni f (u, x, t)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\f9\nTherefore we obtain in Laplace-space with the help of eq.(32) and eq.(30):\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nL{< xni (t)um\n(t)\n>}\n=\ndu\ndz\nds \u03b4(x \u2212 \u03bb\u03b1\u22121 z)h\u0303\u03b1 (s, \u03bb)xni um\ni\ni f1 (u, z, s)\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n0\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n= \u03bb(\u03b1\u22121)n\nds h\u0303\u03b1 (s, \u03bb)\ndu\ndz zin um\n.\ni f1 (u, z, s)\n0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(64)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nIn the last step the integration over the \u03b4-function\nhas been performed. Here we recognize that simply the moments\nR\nR\nn\nn\nm\nof the ordinary Obukhov-model appear: du dz um\ni zi f1 (u, z, s) = < zi (s)ui (s) >. As as consequence the inverse\nLaplace-transform leads to a general expression for the moments of the generalized model:\nZ \u221e\n(\u03b1\u22121)n\n< xni (t)um\n(t)\n>\n=\nD\nds h\u03b1 (s, t) < zin (s)um\n.\n(65)\n0 t\ni\ni (s) >\n0\n\nxni (t)um\ni (t)\n\nThus the moments <\n> can be determined from the moments of the ordinary model < zin (s)um\ni (s) > by\n(s)\n>\ntake\nthe\nform\nof simple\nan inverse L\u00e9vy-transform and fractional integration with respect to t. Since < zin (s)um\ni\npolynomials in s this results in fractional integration of single-time moments of the inverse L\u00e9vy-stable process [9].\nThese calculations can always be performed in an elementary manner.\nFor example, by applying eq.(65) to the second order moments for the case of L = \u2206u we obtain:\n< u2 (s) > = 2s\n< z2 (s) > =\n\n2 3\ns\n3\n\n< z(s)u(s) > = s2\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\n2\nt\u03b1\n,\n\u0393(\u03b1 + 1)\n4\n< x2 (t) > =\nt\u03b1+2\n,\n\u0393(\u03b1 + 3)\n2\nt\u03b1+1 .\n< x(t)u(t) > =\n\u0393(\u03b1 + 2)\n< u2 (t) > =\n\n(66)\n\nClearly, in each case the limit \u03b1 \u2192 1 of the Obukhov-model is satisfied. Therefore the generalized Obukhov-model\neq.(8) with L = \u2206u is characterized by subdiffusive behaviour of the particle velocity corresponding to the fractional\ndiffusion equation (11) and mean square displacement < x2 (t) > \u223c t\u03b1+2 of the particle position.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK\n\nWe have introduced a non-Markovian model for the joint position-velocity probability distribution of a random\nwalk particle as a generalization of Obukhov's model. Long-time correlations of the particle velocity are taken into\naccount by fractional time derivatives. As in the limit case of the fractional diffusion equation, a solution can be\nfound as an integral transformation of the Markovian solution. The integral kernel has been obtained by solving a\nfractional differential equation and yields a complete characterization of the single time statistical properties. As final\nresults we have given analytical expressions for the joint probability distribution and its moments. The generalized\nObukhov-model may thus serve as an appropriate model for random walk processes revealing anomalous diffusion in\nvelocity- and position-space.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and wish to thank R.
