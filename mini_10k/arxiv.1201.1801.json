Besides others, heating processes are the most important\nones: they change not only the physical and chemical properties of dust\nparticles, but also their emission spectra. In order to compare observed\ninfrared spectra of young stellar systems with laboratory data of hot (up\nto 700\u00b0C) circumstellar dust analogues, we investigate materials, which\nare important constituents of dust in protoplanetary disks. We\ncalculated the optical constants by means of a simple Lorentzian\noscillator fit and apply them to simulations of small-particle emission\nspectra in order to compare our results with real astronomical spectra of\nAGB-stars and protoplanetary disks.\n\n1\n\nBackground\n\nMatter in space is subjected to various different temperature conditions. The\ntemperature has a strong effect on the absorption/emission behavior of dust\nparticles [3] and this effect could thoroughly help to give explanations of still\nunidentified bands in stellar spectra (for instance the 13 \u03bcm band in AGB-star\nspectra). Band shifts may also indicate the emission originating from different\nparts of circumstellar disks. Therefore, studying the influence of the temperature on the absorption properties of astrophysical relevant solid materials is an\nimportant aim of laboratory astrophysics.\n\n2\n\nPerforming high temperature infrared spectroscopic measurements\n\nIn this project, which is part of the DFG SPP \"The first 10 million years of\nthe solar system\", we investigated the dependence of the optical constants on\nthe temperature for synthetic bulk materials such as Corundum (\u03b1-Al2 O3 ) and\n1\n\n\fn\n\n\u001d\u001e\u0010\u001f\u0016 w3!\u4d8f#\nlwm\n\n\u0001\n\nlw(\nlwh\nlwg\nl\n\nnl\n\nn\n\ngl\n\ng\n\ntl\n\nt\n\n\u000f\u0010\u0011\u0012\u0013\u0012\u0014\u0015\u0016\u001732\u001a\u001b4\n\nn\n\n\u001d\u001e\u0010\u001f\u0016 w3!\"\"#\n\n\u0001\u0002\ntll\u0005\u0006\nll\u0005\u0006\n(ll\u0005\u0006\n\u03bcll\u0005\u0006\n\nlwm\n\n\u0001\n\nlw(\nlwh\nlwg\nl\n\nnl\n\nn\n\ngl\n\ng\n\ntl\n\nt\n\n\u000f\u0010\u0011\u0012\u0013\u0012\u0014\u0015\u0016\u001732\u001a\u001b4\n\nFigure 1: The measured reflectivity spectra of the natural \u03b1-quartz crystal in\nboth polarizations. At 700\u00b0C some bands totally disappeared (e.g. the 27 \u03bcm\nband in Ekc polaritation), which resulted from the second order phase transition\nto \u03b2-quartz.\nSpinel (MgAl2 O4 ) as well as for natural minerals (\u03b1-Quartz (SiO2 , from Brazil)\nand Olivine (Mg1.84 Fe0.16 SiO4 , San Carlos) crystals). Corundum and spinel\nprevail as early condensates in the stellar outflow of AGB-stars and are constituents of the CAIs in meteorites [1]. Olivine is a very important constituent\nof circumstellar dust disks [2][4] around young and evolved stars and of our own\nplanetary system (main constituents of meteorites [5]).\nAll samples had oriented (except spinel) and polished surfaces to perform\ninfrared reflection-spectroscopy with polarized light. In order to inplement\nthese measurements while the samples are heated, we used a special HighTemperature-High-Pressure (HTHP) cell, that is built into our Bruker 113v\nFTIR Spectrometer. The sample chamber of the cell is a cylindric hole in the\nsample heater of 13 mm diameter through that the infrared beam can reach the\nsample. An infrared polarizer has been set right behind the cell in the outcoming\nbeam, which realized the reflection measurements under polarized light.\nThe measurements have been taken at only four different temperatures:\nroom temperature (RT), 300\u00b0C, 500\u00b0C, and 700\u00b0C to prevent the heater from\nerosion. Only in the case of \u03b1-quartz we measured also at 600\u00b0C to get a better\ntemperature resolution of the (second order) phase transition to \u03b2-quartz that\ntakes place between 500 and 700\u00b0C (see Figure 1).\n\n3\n\nDerivation of optical constants\n\nFrom the measurements we optained simple reflection spectra as can be seen in\nFigure 1. The optical constants (the real part n and the imaginary part k of the\ncomplex refractive index) have been derived from these spectra with Lorentzian\noscillator fits.\nFurthermore, the temperature dependence of the fitting parameters itself\n\n2\n\n\f73kw\n\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u00073py\n\n\u000e\n255\u0011O\nw55\u0011O\nl55\u0011O\n\n75\n\n\u0007 \u0005''\u0005\u0019\u0005\u001d(C*\u001a+,p|\u001b-\u0006 \u0002\u001a\u0005.\u0007/c\n\n7k3w\n\n\u0015\n\nl3w\nw\nk3w\n5\nn\n\n53lw\n53w\n53kw\n5\n7k\n\n75 7k 71 7v 7n k5 kk k1 kv kn 25 2k\n\n\u00016&71wvwk\n\u000e\n255\u0011O\nl55\u0011O\n\n7\n\n7k3w\n\n\u0018\u0002\u0019\u0007\u001a\u0007\u001b\u001c\u001d\u0004p|\u001f c\n\n71\n\n713w\n\n7w\n\n73kw\n\n\u0001\u0003\u0005\u001b\u0007\u001a\n\n\u000e\n255\u0011O\nw55\u0011O\nl55\u0011O\n\nv\nw\n\n\u0015\n\n1\n2\nk\n7\n5\nn\n\n723w\n\n\u0018\u0002\u0019\u0007\u001a\u0007\u001b\u001c\u001d\u0004p|\u001f c\n\u0007 \u0005''\u0005\u0019\u0005\u001d(C*\u001a+,p|\u001b-\u0006 \u0002\u001a\u0005.\u0007/c\n\nl\n\n72\n\n75 7k 71 7v 7n k5 kk k1 kv kn 25\n\n\u0018\u0002\u0019\u0007\u001a\u0007\u001b\u001c\u001d\u0004p|\u001f c\n\n\u00016&71wvwk\n\u000e\n255\u0011O\nl55\u0011O\n\n7\n53lw\n53w\n53kw\n5\n7k\n\n7k3w\n\n72\n\n723w\n\n71\n\n713w\n\n7w\n\n\u0018\u0002\u0019\u0007\u001a\u0007\u001b\u001c\u001d\u0004p|\u001f c\n\nFigure 2: Top: on the left side, the absorption cross section (Cabs) for Corundum (top) and Spinel (below) from room temperature (RT) up to 700\u00b0C can be\nseen.

We\nalso calculated the absorption cross section Cabs (T ) for small (a \u226a \u03bb) spherical\nparticles and multiplied Cabs (T ) with the Planck-function at each temperature\nin order to get the emissivity spectra and to compare the results with astronomical spectra.\nThe results for Spinel and Corundum, can be seen in Figure 2. The kspectra for Corundum and Spinel show almost the same behavior with increasing\ntemperature. The bands shift to longer wavelengths and the intensity of the\nbands decreases. They also become slightly broader. We also compared the\nsmall particle emissivity spectra of both materials with the emission spectrum\nof the AGB star SAO145652, focusing on the 13 \u03bcm band (see Figure 2 on the\nright side). The best reproduction of the 13m band with respect to the band\nposition is only reached by Corundum at 300\u00b0C. At this temperature the band\nof Corundum is too broad to fit the 13 \u03bcm band of the star perfectly, but this\neffect could either be a reason of the calculations or have its origin in the noise\nof the spectrum of the star.\n\n3\n\n\f0.12\nolivine dust RT\no\nolivine dust 700 C\nprotoplanetary disk (HD 145263)\n\nemissivity/IR flux (a.u.)\n\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n10\n\n20\nwavelength (\u03bcm)\n\n30\n\nFigure 3: Comparison of calculated small particle emissivity spectra of olivine\nat two different temperatures and the emission spectrum of the protoplanetary\ndisk HD145263.\n\n4\n\nApplication to the mineralogy of a protoplanetary disk\n\nBesides pyroxenes, olivines are the most abundant crystalline minerals in circumstellar dust disks [2][4]. However, the exact composition of these olivines is\nstill under discussion (especially the iron content), since the composition itself,\nthe grain shape, and the grain size have a strong influence on the position and\nthe shape of bands. With our investigations we can show, that also the temperature, as an additional parameter, plays an important role for the analysis\nof spectra of protoplanetary disks and should be attended in future disussions\nabout the composition of circumstellar dust.\nIn Figure (3) we compared the emission spectrum of the protoplanetary disk\nof HD145263 (taken with ISO) with calculated small particle emissivity spectra\nof olivine, based on our measurements at RT and 700\u00b0C. It can be seen that the\ndust at 700\u00b0C fits somewhat better the observed emission spectrum than the dust\nat RT (indicated by the vertical dashed lines, which mark the band positions\nof olivine dust in the spectrum of HD145263). Of course we do not claim, that\nthe olivine dust in this protoplanetary disk has a temperature of exactly 700\u00b0C.\nBeside the other mentioned influences on an emission spectrum, the dust will\nalways hold a certain temperature distribution. But it should be noted, that for\nthe analysis of spectra of circumstellar dust disks, the temperature of the dust\nshould be taken into account just as the shape, size, and the composition of the\ndust grains.\n\nReferences\n[1] Fabian, D., Posch, Th., Mutschke, H., Kerschbaum, F., Dorschner J., A&A,\np. 373 (2001)\n4\n\n\f[2] Juhasz A., Bouwman J., Henning Th., Acke B., van den Ancker M.E., Meeus\nG., Dominik C., Min M., Thielens A.G.G.M., Waters L.B.F.M., The Astrophysical Journal 721, p. 431 (2010)\n[3] Koike C., Mutschke H., Suto H., Naoi T., Chihara H., Henning Th., J\u00e4ger\nC., Tsuchiyama A., Dorschner H., Okuda H., A&A 449, p. 583 (2006)\n[4] Henning, Th.
