In\nparticular, understanding the space\u2013time causal structure of black holes is\nstill a fundamental problem from the view point of the duality. Although one\nbelieves, based on basic properties of the dual CFT, that the bulk dynamics\nis well defined, it is fair to say that the quantum nature of horizons and\nsingularities remains rather mysterious [2].\nThe AdS3 /CFT2 case is one of the best studied examples of the duality,\nwith black hole geometries given by the BTZ metric [3, 4]\nds2 = \u2212N 2 dt2 + N \u22122 dr 2 + r 2 (d\u03c6 \u2212 N\u03c6 dt)2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nN2 =\n\n\u0001 2\n\u0001\n1\n2\n2\n2\nr\n\u2212\nr\nr\n\u2212\nr\n,\n+\n\u2212\nl2 r 2\n\nN\u03c6 =\n\n1 r+ r\u2212\n.\nl r2\n\nThe AdS3 radius is given by l, and r+ , r\u2212 are the positions of the outer\nand inner horizons determining the mass and the angular momentum of the\n1\n\n\fblack hole\nMbh\n\n\u03c0M\n=\n4\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nr+2 + r\u22122\n+1 ,\nl2\n\nJ=\n\n\u03c0M r+ r\u2212\n,\n2\nl\n\nin terms of the three\u2013dimensional Planck mass1 M .\nIn the dual CFT2 description, these black holes correspond to states with\n[5]\nL0 + L\u03030 = lMbh ,\nL0 \u2212 L\u03030 = J,\nwhere L0 , L\u03030 are the Virasoro zero modes. Moreover, since the \u03c6 circle\nis a non\u2013contractible loop in spacetime, in the presence of fermions one\nneeds to choose a spin structure. Usually one considers periodic boundary\nconditions for the fermions, which allow for a covariantly constant spinor in\nthe extremal case r+ = r\u2212 and which give a state in the Ramond sector of\nthe CFT2 . One may also choose antiperiodic boundary conditions, which\ndescribe a non\u2013supersymmetric state in the NS sector of the CFT2 . From\nthis point of view, the spin eigenvalue J is naturally quantized in half integral\nunits\n2J \u2208 Z .\n(2)\nOn the other hand, from a purely gravitational view point, the quantization\nof the angular momentum is rather mysterious. Classically, J is a continuous\nparameter, and the usual arguments leading to (2) rely on the asymptotic\nsymmetries of quantum gravity on AdS3 [6], and therefore implicitly on the\nexistence of a dual CFT2 .\nAn intriguing property of the BTZ black holes is the existence of closed\ncausal curves (CCC's) in the geometry. In fact, these holes are quotients\nof AdS3 by the action of a specific isometry parameterized by r+ , r\u2212 , and\nthe identification creates CCC's located in the region inside the inner horizon. The black hole has a chronological singularity where the generator of\nthe orbifold isometry becomes null. Therefore, if we ignore the dual CFT\ndescription, we naively expect that quantum gravity in the BTZ geometry\npresents pathologies due to the existence of these CCC's. In particular, one\nwould a priori expect violations of unitarity, which would undermine the\npossible existence of an S matrix.\nBy studying quantum field theory in the flat space limit l \u2192 \u221e of the\nBTZ geometry, we shall show that the quantization condition (2) can be\n1\nFor notational convenience, we normalize the Planck mass in terms of the Newton\nconstant G as M \u22121 = 2\u03c0G.\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 1: Leading correction to the free propagation of a scalar field due to gravitational interactions with virtual particles winding closed causal curves.\n\nobtained by demanding that quantum propagation of fields is consistent\nwith unitarity, even in the presence of CCC's. The argument will use very\nlimited information about the underlying quantum gravity. In particular,\nwe shall not use any string theoretic arguments, since we shall work at\nenergies well below the string scale, where \u03b1\u2032 corrections should be negligible.\nMore specifically, we will consider corrections to free propagation of scalar\nfields due to interactions with particles winding around the closed timelike\ndirection, as shown in Figure 1. By carefully choosing the quantum numbers\nof the external states, we will show, using general arguments [7], that the\ninteraction is dominated by graviton exchange in the eikonal regime. In this\nkinematical regime, one has enough control over the resummation of the\nperturbative series determining the gravitational interaction, and one can\nrecover the quantization condition (2) by enforcing unitarity.\nFor a given BTZ black hole with geometric parameters r+ , r\u2212 , one could\nin principle start by considering quantum gravity at arbitrary values of the\ngravitational coupling M \u22121 . However, the presence of CCC's breaks unitarity order by order in the coupling constant [8], suggesting that one is not free\nto choose M \u22121 at will and that one needs to resum the perturbation series.\nThe quantization condition (2), which follows from unitarity, can then be\ninterpreted as fixing the gravitational coupling M \u22121 at some specific values.\nThe usual belief regarding the dynamics inside the horizons of a BTZ\nblack hole is that the geometry (1) will be modified due to the classical\ninstability of the inner horizon [9] and also due to divergences of the quantum\nstress\u2013energy tensor at polarization surfaces in the region inside the inner\nhorizon [10]. We propose, on the other hand, that the geometry remains\nunaltered and non\u2013causal, but the propagation of states is strongly modified\n3\n\n\fby quantum effects in the inner region and is consistent whenever (2) is\nsatisfied. It is tempting to speculate that such modification of the dynamics\ninside the horizons is responsible for the reduction of degrees of freedom\nassociated to the black hole entropy, which is not proportional to the volume\nof the black hole but to its horizon area.\n\n2\n\nThe orbifold\n\nFor simplicity we focus on the extremal black hole, with r+ = r\u2212 and Penrose\ndiagram given in Figure 2a, which is a quotient of AdS3 space. In the flat\nspace l \u2192 \u221e limit, keeping the energy scale\nE=\n\nl\n(2\u03c0r+ )2\n\nfixed, the region inside the black hole horizon becomes an orbifold of flat\nMinkowski space M3 /e\u03ba , introduced in [11]. Choosing coordinates x\u00b1 , x on\nM3 , such that the metric is\nds2 = \u22122dx+ dx\u2212 + dx2 ,\nthe orbifold generator \u03ba is the Killing vector\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03ba = i L+x + E \u22121 K\u2212 = \u2212 x\u2212 \u2202x + x\u2202+ + E \u22121 \u2202\u2212 ,\n\nwhere Lab , Ka are, respectively, the generators of Lorentz transformations\nand translations, and where E parameterizes inequivalent orbifolds. For a\ndetailed derivation of the l \u2192 \u221e limiting procedure, we refer the reader to\nappendix A.\nUnder the change of coordinates\nx+ = y + \u2212 Eyy \u2212 +\nx\u2212 = y \u2212 ,\nx = y\u2212\n\nE\ny\n2\n\nthe metric becomes\n\n\u0001\n\u2212 2\n\nE 2 \u2212 \u00013\n,\ny\n6\n\n,\n\nds2 = \u22122dy + dy \u2212 + 2Ey dy \u2212\nand the Killing vector\n\u03ba=\n\n1 \u2202\n.\nE \u2202y \u2212\n4\n\n(3)\n\n\u00012\n\n+ dy 2\n\n(4)\n\n\fFigure 2: Penrose diagram of the extremal BTZ black hole (a). The shaded\narea represents the region behind the chronological singularity, where closed causal\ncurves are present. In the limit l \u2192 \u221e, J fixed, one focuses on the region inside\nthe black hole horizon and obtains a flat space orbifold with Penrose diagram (b).\n\nThe direction y \u2212 is therefore compact with period\ny\u2212 \u223c y\u2212 +\n\n1\n.\nE\n\nNote that the form of the metric (4) can be directly obtained from the BTZ\nmetric (1) for r+ = r\u2212 , by setting y = 2\u03c0 2 Er 2 , 2\u03c0y + = t, 2\u03c0Ey \u2212 = \u03c6, and\nthen by taking the limit l \u2192 \u221e described above.

In the non\u2013extremal case a similar large l limit leads to\nthe shift\u2013boost orbifold of M3 , which focuses on the region inside the outer\nhorizon [12].\nThe quantization of the BTZ black hole angular momentum (2) becomes,\nin the flat space limit, the condition\n2J =\n\nM\n\u2208 Z.\n4\u03c0E\n\n(5)\n\nIn this case, on the other hand, one cannot justify this quantization condition\nwith arguments relying on asymptotic symmetries and on the existence of\na dual CFT. In fact, the Minkowski space orbifold just described focuses\n\n5\n\n\fon the region inside the horizons, and the asymptotic AdS boundary is no\nlonger part of the geometry.\nAn independent way of deriving (5) is to embed the orbifold in string\ntheory, by considering Type II strings on M3 /e\u03ba \u00d7 T7 [11]. After a sequence\nof dualities, the geometry becomes that of an orientifold O8 plane [13].\nFrom this point of view, (5) results from the fact that 8\u2013dimensional RR\ncharged objects have charges quantized in units of the D8\u2013brane charge.\nAlthough these arguments rely on the low\u2013energy supergravity description\nof the system, they lead to the same condition.\nIt is the main point of this paper to derive the quantization condition\n(5) purely within the framework of quantum field theory in the presence\nof gravitational interactions. From this perspective, (5) is obtained by requiring unitarity in the space M3 /e\u03ba , which possess CCC's. Hence we see\nthat unitarity in the presence of CCC's is related to charge quantization in\ndual descriptions of the system. The mechanics that protects chronology is\nrather different than that proposed by Hawking [14], which is based on a\nlarge backreaction due to UV effects.\nFor other studies of orbifolds with CCC's, where an analogous study of\nunitarity can in principle be done, see [15\u201332].\n\n2.1\n\nGeometry\n\nWe now analyze, in more detail, the geometry of the orbifold M3 /e\u03ba . First\nlet us note that the square\u2013norm of \u03ba is given by\n\u03ba2 =\n\n2y\n.\nE\n\nThe compact y \u2212 circle is space\u2013like for y > 0 and timelike for y < 0.\nTherefore, the geometry has CCC's. It is simple to show that all CCC's\nmust go in the region with y < 0. To prove this fact, assume that we have\na CCC parameterized by y a (\u03bb) with \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1]. Since y + (0) = y + (1), the\nfunction y + (\u03bb) must achieve an extremum for some \u03bb\u0304 \u2208 (0, 1). At \u03bb = \u03bb\u0304,\n2\nthe metric (4) reduces to 2Ey (dy \u2212 ) + dy 2 , which is positive\u2013definite for\n\u0001\ny > 0. Therefore, the curve can be timelike or null only if y \u03bb\u0304 \u2264 0. A\nschematic representation of these basic features of the geometry is shown in\nFigure 3.\nA particularly interesting class of closed curves are the ones obtained\nfrom geodesics in the covering space M3 connecting points which are related\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 3: A representation of the basic features of the orbifold geometry. The null\nKilling direction y + and the transverse direction y are drawn on the plane. The\ncompact y \u2212 circle is spacelike for positive y and timelike in the shaded region after\nthe chronological singularity. Represented are also the first polarization surfaces at\nyw = w2 /(24E). Finally we show a closed timelike curve and a closed null curve.\nThe latter starts and ends on the first polarization surface.\n\nby the action of the orbifold group. Denoting, for notational convenience,\nthe orbifold group generator by\n\u03a9 = e\u03ba ,\nit is a simple matter to show, starting from (3), that the continuous transformation y \u2212 \u2192 y \u2212 + s/E generated by \u03a9s reads, in the coordinates xa ,\ns3\ns2 \u2212\nx +\n,\n(\u03a9s x)+ = x+ \u2212 sx +\n2\n6E\ns\n(\u03a9s x)\u2212 = x\u2212 + ,\nE\ns2\n(\u03a9s x) = x \u2212 sx\u2212 \u2212\n.\n2E\n\n(6)\n\nTherefore, the geodesic distance squared (\u03a9w x \u2212 x)2 between a point x and\nits w\u2013th image (w \u2208 Z) is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nw2\n2w2\ny\u2212\n,\nE\n24E\nand becomes null at the so\u2013called polarization surfaces\ny=\n\nw2\n.\n24E\n\nFor y < w2 /(24E) the geodesic from x to \u03a9w x is a closed timelike curve.\nThe polarization surfaces are also represented in Figure 3.\n7\n\n\f2.2\n\nParticle wavefunctions\n\nIn order to analyze the propagation of scalar fields in the orbifold geometry,\nwe must first find a convenient basis of functions invariant under the orbifold\naction. It is useful to consider first the transformation of the plane waves\n\u03c6k (x) = eik*x\nunder the action of \u03a9. Using (6), it is simple to show that\n\u0001\n\u03c6k \u03a9\u2212s x = \u03c6\u03a9s k (x) e\u2212i\u03c6(k,s) ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the transformed momentum \u03a9s k is given by\n(\u03a9s k)+ = k+ ,\n(\u03a9s k)\u2212 = k\u2212 + sk +\n(\u03a9s k) = k + sk+ .\n\ns2\nk+ ,\n2\n(8)\n\nThe above phase \u03c6(k, s) is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\ns2\n1 s3\nk+ + sk\u2212 +\nk ,\n\u03c6(k, s) =\nE 6\n2\nand satisfies \u03c6(k, s + t) = \u03c6(k, s) + \u03c6(\u03a9s k, t).\nWe can construct, starting from any plane wave \u03c6k (x), a function on M3\nwhich is invariant under \u03a9 and which is an eigenvector of \u03ba with eigenvalue\n2\u03c0in, where n \u2208 Z. This is given by the integral representation\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\n2\u03c0ins\n\u2212s\nds e\n\u03c6k \u03a9 x = ds \u03c6\u03a9s k (x) e2\u03c0ins\u2212i\u03c6(k,s) .\n(9)\n\nSince (\u03a9s k)2 = k2 , and since (\u03a9s k)+ = k+ , the above functions are automatically eigenvectors of the Laplacian \u0003 and of the momentum operator\nK+ . We then choose, as a convenient basis for the invariant functions on\nM3 /e\u03ba , eigenfunctions V\u03bb,p+ ,p\u2212 (x) of the commuting operators \u0003, K+ and\n\u03ba, with eigenvalues\n\u0003 = \u03bb,\nK+ = p+ ,\n\u2212iE\u03ba = p\u2212 ,\n\n8\n\n(10)\n\n\fwhere p\u2212 is related to the eigenvalue n by2\np\u2212 = 2\u03c0E n .\nChoosing, in (9), the momentum k = (p+ , \u03bb/2p+ , 0), we immediately obtain\nthe explicit representation\nZ\n+\n\u2212\n1\nV\u03bb,p+ ,p\u2212 (x) =\n(11)\ndk e i(p+ x +k\u2212 x +kx) \u00d7\n|p+ |\n\u0014\n\u0015\nk3\ni\n(2p+ p\u2212 \u2212 \u03bb) k \u2212\n\u00d7 exp\n,\n3\n2Ep+2\nwhere we have changed the integration variable to k = sp+ , and where k\u2212\nis given by the on\u2013shell condition\nk\u2212 =\n\nk2 + \u03bb\n.\n2p+\n\nThe sector with p+ = 0 clearly requires a separate treatment. In this\ncase, (8) implies that the component k = (\u03a9s k) is invariant under \u03a9, and\nwe can choose eigenfunctions Vp,p\u2212 (x) with\nK = p,\n\u2212iE\u03ba = p\u2212 ,\nwhere K is the momentum operator \u2212i\u2202x . Choosing, in (9), the momentum\nk = (0, 0, p), and as integration variable k\u2212 = sp, we obtain the integral\nrepresentation\n\"\n#\nZ\n2\n(k\n)\n\u2212\ni\n1\n\u2212\np\u2212 k\u2212 \u2212\n,\n(12)\ndk\u2212 e i(k\u2212 x +px) exp\nVp,p\u2212 (x) =\n|p|\npE\n2\nwhich has p+ = 0 and \u03bb = \u2212p2 .\nThe functions V\u03bb,p+ ,p\u2212 and Vp,p\u2212 represent a complete basis of invariant\nfunctions on M3 /e\u03ba , and transform, under conjugation, as\n\u22c6\nV\u03bb,p\n(x) = V\u03bb,\u2212p+ ,\u2212p\u2212 (x) ,\n+ ,p\u2212\n\u22c6\nVp,p\n(x) = V\u2212p,\u2212p\u2212 (x) .\n\u2212\n2\n\nThroughout the paper, we use k, q to denote covering space momenta \u2013 i.e eigenvalues\nof \u2212i\u2202x . We reserve p\u00b1 for the momenta in the y coordinates \u2212i\u2202y \u00b1\n\n9\n\n\fIt is useful to consider the above functions in the coordinates y \u00b1 , y. The\noperators in (10) are given, in these coordinates, by\n\u0003 = \u22122\u2202y+ \u2202y\u2212 \u2212 2Ey\u2202y2+ + \u2202y2 ,\nK+ = \u2212i\u2202y+ ,\n\u2212iE\u03ba = \u2212i\u2202y\u2212 .\nWe can then use separation of variables to find functions satisfying (10) of\n+\n\u2212\nthe form f (y) e i(p+ y +p\u2212 y ) , where f (y) solves\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd2\n2\n2p+ p\u2212 + 2Ep+ y + 2 \u2212 \u03bb f (y) = 0 .\n(13)\ndy\nDefining the dimensionless variable\nz=\n\n2Ep+2\n\n\u0001 31\n\n\u0012\n\n(y \u2212 y0 ) ,\n\n\u03bb \u2212 2p+ p\u2212\ny0 =\n2Ep+2\n\n\u0013\n\nthe above differential equation simplifies to d2 f /dz 2 + zf = 0, which describes in quantum mechanics a zero energy particle subject to a linear potential. The solutions are the Airy functions Ai(\u2212z) and Bi(\u2212z), which are,\nrespectively, exponentially damped and exponentially growing in the z < 0\nregion. This region corresponds mostly to negative y, where the Killing vector \u03ba is time\u2013like. In the sequel, we shall consider the normalizable solution\nAi (\u2212z) which corresponds to the integral representation (11). Using the\nrepresentation of the Airy function\n\u0011\n\u0010\nZ\n3\n1\ni zt\u2212 t3\nAi(\u2212z) =\n,\ndt e\n2\u03c0\nit is a matter of computation to show, using (3) and (11), that\nV\u03bb,p+ ,p\u2212 (y) = 2\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\n2E\n|p+ |\n\n\u00131\n3\n\nAi(\u2212z) e i(p+ y\n\n+ +p\n\n\u2212y\n\n\u2212)\n\n.\n\nThe case p+ = 0 is simpler since in the differential equation (13) the linear\npotential term is absent. The solutions are simply plane waves f (y) \u221d e\u00b1ipy ,\nwith p2 = \u2212\u03bb. In fact, we can explicitly integrate (12) and obtain\ns\n2\u03c0E i(py+p\u2212 y\u2212 )\nVp,p\u2212 (y) =\ne\n.\n(14)\nip\n\n10\n\n\fFinally, the inner product of the wave functions is given by\nZ\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nd3 x V\u03bb,p+ ,p\u2212 (x) V\u03bb\u22c6\u2032 ,p\u2032 ,p\u2032 (x) = 16\u03c0 3 \u03b4 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 \u03b4 p+ \u2212 p\u2032+ \u03b4 p\u2212 \u2212p\u2032\u2212 ,\n+ \u2212\nF\nZ\n\u0001\n4\u03c0 2\nd3 x Vp,p\u2212 (x) Vp\u22c6\u2032 ,p\u2032 (x) =\nT \u03b4 p \u2212 p\u2032 \u03b4 p\u2212 \u2212p\u2032\u2212 ,\n(15)\n\u2212\n|p|\nF\nR\nwhere T = dy + = 2\u03c0\u03b4 (p+ = 0) is the volume in the y + direction and\nF \u2282 M3 is a fundamental domain of the orbifold (we can consider F to\nbe, for concreteness, the region 0 < y \u2212 < 1/E). A simple way to prove\nthe above expressions is to use the integral representations (11) and (12)\nand to extend the integration region from F to M3 . One then uses the\northogonality of the plane waves \u03c6k (x) to derive the desired result. The\novercounting due to the extension of the integration region can be taken\ninto account by substituting, at the end of the computation, the Dirac \u03b4\u2013\nfunction with the Kronecher symbol for the discrete Kalu\u017ca\u2013Klein charge as\nfollows\n\u0001\n\u03b4 n \u2212 n\u2032 \u2192 \u03b4 n\u2212n\u2032 ,\n(16)\n\u0001\n2\u03c0 \u03b4 p\u2212 \u2212 p\u2032\u2212 \u2192 E \u22121 \u03b4 p\u2212 \u2212p\u2032\u2212 .\nThe correctness of the normalization in the above expression can be checked,\nfor instance, by computing (15) directly in the y\u2013coordinates, using the\nexplicit expression (14).\n\n3\n\nFeynman rules\n\nWe shall start our investigation of quantum field theory in the orbifold space\nby considering, as a simple toy model, a scalar field \u03a6 with a cubic coupling,\ndescribed by the action\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u0001\ng 3\n1\n2\n3\n\u03a6 \u0003\u2212m \u03a6+ \u03a6 .\n(17)\nd x\n2\n6\nF\n\nWe shall analyze the perturbative expansion of this theory in some detail,\nsince some of the basic features of field and string theory on M3 /e\u03ba can be\nalready understood in this simple setting.

Therefore, the\nincoming momentum along the line is \u03a9w/2 q and the outgoing one is \u03a9\u2212w/2 q,\nas shown in Figure 4. We have made an explicit choice of i\u01eb prescription\nfor the propagator, which is implicitly a choice of vacuum for the spacetime\nunder consideration. This choice is canonical in orbifold theories, and for\nBTZ black holes corresponds to the usual Hartle-Hawking vacuum.\nWe are now ready to state the Feynman rules for computing the amputated n\u2013point amplitude of a given connected graph G. We are not going to\ngive a formal proof of these rules, since it is simple but notationally quite\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 5: A two\u2013loop graph, with loop winding numbers \u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2 . The P\nwinding\n4\nnumbers wi for the propagators can be chosen arbitrarily, as long as \u03c9 1 =\nand \u03c9 2 = w5 \u2212 w3 .\n\ni=1\n\nwi\n\ncumbersome. We hope that the reader with some familiarity with the standard techniques of field theory can convince (her)himself of the validity of\nthe rules below.\ni) First assign winding numbers wi to all internal propagators of G. This\ndefines a 1\u2013cocycle for the graph, and therefore an element of the cohomology group \u03c9 \u2208 H 1 (G). We can think of propagators in the\ngraph literally as particle propagation. The numbers wi define how\nmany times the particle winds around the compact y \u2212 circle as one\ngoes around a loop of G. For the element \u03c9 \u2208 H 1 (G), the intermediate results of the computation will depend on the specific choice of\nrepresentative wi (\u03c9), but the final result will only depend on the class\n\u03c9. We should consider as distinct only choices of windings wi corresponding to different classes in H 1 (G). As an illustration, Figure 5\nshows the choices of winding numbers and classes for a given two\u2013loop\ngraph.\nii) Fix external momenta ki flowing into the graph, and compute the\ndiagram with the usual Feynman rules, but with propagators given by\nthe above prescription. The result will depend on the explicit choice\nof representative wi (\u03c9). Let us denote it by\n\u0393wi (k1 , * * * , kn ) .\nThe momenta ki should be thought of as covering space momenta,\neven though \u0393wi is not in general Lorentz invariant. However, since\n13\n\n\finvariance under K+ is preserved, the above amplitude will always\ncontain a delta function 2\u03c0 \u03b4 (\u03a3i ki+ ) .\niii) Average over the action of the group on the external states as we did\nfor the particle wave functions, by considering the integral\nZ\nds1 * * * dsn e i\u03c7(si ) \u0393wi (\u03a9s1 k1 , * * * , \u03a9sn kn ) ,\n(19)\nwith\n\u03c7 (si ) = 2\u03c0\n\nP\n\ni si ni\n\n\u2212\n\nP\n\ni \u03c6 (ki , si )\n\n.\n\nThe above integral overcounts the result, since invariance under the\norbifold action \u03ba implies that\nP\n\u0010 \u2032 \u0011\n\u2032\ne i\u03c7(si ) \u0393wi (\u03a9si ki ) = e2\u03c0is i ni e i\u03c7(si ) \u0393wi \u03a9si ki ,\n\nwhere si = s\u2032i + s. We may insert, in (19), the identity \"1\"\nZ\n\u0001\nP\nP\n\u2032\n| i ci | ds \u03b4\ni ci si ,\n\nP\nwhere the constants ci can be chosen arbitrarily, as long as i ci 6= 0.\nChanging integration variables to the s\u2032i , we can perform the integral\nP\nover s and obtain a delta function \u03b4 ( i ni ). Restricting the integral\nover s to a single action of the orbifold generator, from 0 to 1, or following the prescription in (16), we can substitute this \u03b4\u2013function with\na Kronecher symbol. Dropping the primes we arrive at the amplitude\n\n\u03b4 \u03a3 ni\n\nP\n| i ci |\n\nZ\n\nP\nds1 * * * dsn \u03b4 ( i ci si ) e i\u03c7(si ) \u0393wi (\u03a9si ki ) .\n\n(20)\n\nThis expression depends only on the specific class \u03c9 \u2208 H 1 (G) and it\nis the final result given a specific choice of \u03c9 and of external states.\niv) Finally sum over \u03c9. The term with \u03c9 = 0 is singled out since it comes\nfrom the parent theory in M3 . In fact, we can choose wi = 0 for\nall internal propagators and, in this case, \u0393wi (ki ) can be computed\nwith the usual flat space Feynman propagator. The only sign of the\norbifold would then be in the choice of external states. If G is a tree\u2013\nlevel graph, then H 1 (G) = 0 and the only term in the sum comes from\nthe parent theory. This is usually called the inheritance principle.\n\n14\n\n\fTo do computations, it is convenient to specialize the formula (20) to\nthe external states given by the functions V\u03bb,p+ ,p\u2212 and Vp,p\u2212 . Consider first\nthe case when all n external states have p+ 6= 0 and are labeled by \u03bbi , pi+ ,\npi\u2212 .

The dynamics is strongly\ncoupled in the shaded region due to gravitational interactions in the presence of\nCCC's, which naively violate unitarity.

The\n\nconserved momenta p\u00b1 flow through the diagram, whereas \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 are the off\u2013shell\nmass squared of the external legs. The shaded blob is computed using the Feynman rules of section 3 and includes internal propagators winding the compact y \u2212\ndirection.\n\nconsider a scalar field with action (17), minimally coupled to gravity, and\nfor simplicity consider the massless case m = 0. One expects that the\nexistence of CCC's will not allow a consistent definition of single particle\nstates and of an unitary S matrix in the interacting theory. This belief is\nsupported by perturbative computations, since the usual Cutkosky cutting\nrules are no longer valid, and unitarity fails order by order in the coupling\nconstant [8]. A simple example of this fact will be described in section 4.1.\nOn the other hand, from the duality arguments given in the introduction,\none expects, for a given value of the geometric parameter E, to be able to\ndefine consistently a unitary S matrix for the discrete values of the Planck\nmass given by (5). For those values of M , we expect to be able to define\nparticle states interacting strongly with the gravitational field and scattering\nwith unit probability, as show pictorially in Figure 6.\nTo investigate the possible restoration of unitarity, we shall study the\ntwo\u2013point function of the scalar field, which defines single particle states. As\nshown in Figure 7, this two\u2013point function is determined by the conserved\nmomenta p+ , p\u2212 flowing in the diagram, together with the off\u2013shell mass\n\u0001\nsquared \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 of the external legs. We denote it by \u0393p+ ,p\u2212 \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 , so that the\nfull propagator becomes\n\u0001\n\u0001\n16\u03c0 2 E (\u03bb + i\u01eb) \u03b4 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 + \u0393p+ ,p\u2212 \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 .\n(24)\nIt is then possible to define consistently single particle states whenever the\nabove kernel has real eigenfunctions with vanishing eigenvalue. This will\ncertainly be the case if the effective potential \u0393p+ ,p\u2212 determining the propagation of the scalar field satisfies the reality condition\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0393p\u22c6+ ,p\u2212 \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 = \u0393p+ ,p\u2212 \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bb .\n(25)\nNote that, in quantum field theory, the potential \u0393p+ ,p\u2212 can in principle have\nan imaginary part coming from on\u2013shell intermediate states.

The remaining effective vertices, shown with light gray\nblobs, are computed in the parent theory to all orders in the coupling constant, with\ninternal propagators with vanishing winding number.\n\nhand, the contribution to \u0393 considered in this paper has no contributions\nfrom intermediate on\u2013shell lines and therefore any deviation from the reality\ncondition (25) would be a sign of inconsistency of the theory. We shall\ncomeback to this point at the end of section 4.4.\nWe will be able, in particular, to compute the first non\u2013trivial contribution to the full scalar propagator probing the non\u2013causal structure of space\u2013\n\u0001\ntime. As shown in Figure 8, we consider an expansion of \u0393p+ ,p\u2212 \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bb in\nincreasing number of internal propagators with non\u2013vanishing winding number. We shall focus on the leading non\u2013trivial contribution arising from the\ngraph 9. The loop propagator will have non\u2013vanishing winding number w,\nwhereas the bubble in the graph represents the four\u2013point interaction in the\nparent theory on M3 to all orders in the couplings. In the limit of p+ , \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032\nsmall, we shall see that, to compute the graph, we will only need control over\nthe parent four\u2013point amplitude in the eikonal kinematical regime, where\nresummation techniques are known and where general arguments indicate\nthat interactions are dominated by graviton exchange. The form of the\n\u0001\neikonal amplitude in three dimensions is such that \u0393p+ ,p\u2212 \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bb satisfies\n(25) exactly at the values of the gravitational coupling constant M \u22121 given\nby (5).\nAs a warm\u2013up exercise, we compute, in the next subsection, the scalar\none\u2013loop tadpole graph, so that the reader can get acquainted with loop\ncomputations in the orbifold theory. This simple computation already shows\n17\n\n\fFigure 9: Leading non\u2013trivial contribution to the two\u2013point function \u0393p+ ,p\u2212 (\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 ),\nas shown in Figure 8. The loop momentum has non\u2013vanishing winding number w,\nwhereas the blob A represents the four\u2013point amplitude in the parent theory to all\norders in the coupling constants.\n\nthe breakdown of the cutting rules.\n\n4.1\n\nOne\u2013loop tadpole\n\nLet us explicitly compute the one\u2013loop tadpole graph of Figure 10, which\ncontributes to the effective action with the term\nZ\nd3 x \u03a6(x) \u0393(x) .\n(26)\nF\n\nConservation of p\u00b1 forces the external leg to have quantum numbers p\u00b1 = 0.\nThus the one\u2013loop tadpole can be written in momentum space as\nZ\n1\n\u0393 (p) =\nd3 x Vp,0 (x) \u0393(x) ,\nT E \u22121 F\nwhere the wave functions Vp,0 were introduced in section 2.2.

Correspondingly, in momentum space, the contribution to \u0393 (p)\nis non\u2013vanishing only for p < 0 and comes uniquely from on\u2013shell particles\nrunning in the loop, which wind around the compact circle and contribute\nwith an imaginary part to the one\u2013loop tadpole.\nIn the computation of the graph in Figure 10, the three\u2013vertex is probed\nat high energies, and therefore interactions will drastically modify its behavior, even in the parent theory. As for the two\u2013point function, we should\nconsider the expansion in Figure 8 and compute graph 10 with the complete\nparent three\u2013point coupling. This coupling is dominated by gravitational\ninteractions and can be resummed in some cases with eikonal techniques.\nOn the other hand, we shall not pursue this line any further and we shall\nconcentrate mostly on the most relevant computation of the two\u2013point function.\n\n4.2\n\nTwo\u2013point function\n\nLet us consider now the quadratic term in the effective action, which is\ncomposed of the free part in (17), together with the contribution from interactions given by\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\nd3 x d3 x\u2032 \u03a6 (x) \u03a6 x\u2032 \u0393 x, x\u2032 .\n(29)\n2 F\nIn momentum space the two\u2013point function \u0393 (x, x\u2032 ) becomes\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0001\nd3 x d3 x\u2032 V\u03bb,p+,p\u2212 (x) V\u03bb\u2032 ,p\u2032+ ,p\u2032\u2212 x\u2032 \u0393 x, x\u2032 =\nF\n\u0001\n\u0001\n= E \u22121 \u03b4 p\u2212 +p\u2032\u2212 2\u03c0 \u03b4 p+ + p\u2032+ \u0393p+ ,p\u2212 \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 ,\n\u0001\n\u0001\nwhere \u0393p+ ,p\u2212 \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 = \u0393\u2212p+ ,\u2212p\u2212 \u03bb\u2032 , \u03bb . As for the one\u2013loop tadpole, the\nlast equation can be explicitly computed using the Feynman rules of section\n3, in particular using equation (21).

This can be understood, for example, from\nthe behavior of the one\u2013loop tadpole in position space. For a given value\nof w, the contribution to the tadpole diverges and acquires an imaginary\npart at the w\u2013th polarization surface. Therefore, in position space, this\nsingular behavior occurs at widely separated positions for different values of\nthe winding number w and we expect these pathologies to be cured for each\nw.\nWe close this section with an important kinematic consideration. When\nthe winding particle is on\u2013shell, then s = \u2212u = 4pp\u2212 / |w|. Since |t| \u223c p2 ,\nthe parent amplitude is evaluated in the eikonal regime\n|s|, |u| \u226b |t| .\n23\n\n\fMoreover, this regime continues to be valid throughout the whole integration\nregion in s. In fact, for the non\u2013generic case where |s| . |t|, the other\ninvariant u is of order pp\u2212 / |w| and still satisfies u \u226b t. A similar remark\napplies when |u| . |t|. In the following section we do a detour on the eikonal\napproximation to the scattering of a scalar field in three dimensions. The\nresults will be used in the computation of the orbifold two\u2013point amplitude.\n\n4.3\n\nEikonal approximation\n\nLet us recall first the s\u2013channel partial wave decomposition for the on\u2013shell\nscattering amplitude of massless scalars in three dimensions\n\u221a X in\u03b8 2i\u03b4 n (s)\n1 + iA = 4 s\ne e\n.\nn\n\nThe scattering angle \u03b8 is given by sin2 (\u03b8/2) = \u2212t/s and the phase shifts\nsatisfy \u03b4 n = \u03b4 \u2212n . Unitarity requires that Im \u03b4 n \u2265 0. In the eikonal\np\nlimit s \u2243 \u2212u \u226b \u2212t, the scattering angle is given by \u03b8 \u2243 2 \u2212t/s and one\nmay replace the sum over partial waves with an integral over the impact\n\u221a\nparameter x = 2n/ s. One then obtains the eikonal expression\nZ\n\u221a\n1 + iA \u2243 2s dx eix \u2212t e2i\u03b4(s,x) .\n(39)\nThis representation can be derived by studying the s \u226b |t| limit of the\ngeneralized ladder graphs shown in Figure 11. It turns out that the loop\nexpansion matches the expansion in powers of \u03b4 [7, 33, 34, 35], so that the\nphase shift is given, in terms of the leading tree\u2013level interaction Atree (s, t),\nby the simple Fourier transform\nZ\n\u221a\nAtree \u2243 4s dx eix \u2212t \u03b4(s, x) .\nConsider now scattering due to the exchange of a spin j massless particle.\nThen Atree \u2243 \u22124M 3\u22122j sj /t, where we are implicitly assuming that the\ncoupling constants are of order one in Planck units3 . The phase shift is then\ngiven by\n\u0001j\u22121\n2 \u03b4(s, x) \u2243 \u2212 s/M 2\nM |x| .\n(40)\n3\n\nWe assume that all couplings are of the same order in Planck units mostly for notational simplicity. In case of a large ratios between the couplings, the gravitational\ninteraction will still dominate in the regimes of interest, as explained in the rest of this\nsection, but the specific bounds will have to be modified accordingly. Moreover, the most\nrelevant examples coming from compactifications of supergravity theories do have a single\ngravitational coupling.\n\n24\n\n\fFigure 11: Generalized ladder diagram contributing to the scattering amplitude\nA of scalar particles in the eikonal regime s \u226b |t|. The exchanged particle can\nhave in general spin j but, in the kinematical regime of interest, the gravitational\ninteraction j = 2 will dominate.\n\nIt is linear in the impact parameter |x| and negative. These facts are easily\nunderstood in the j = 2 case of graviton exchange. In this case, following\nthe work of 't Hooft [7], we can think of the scattered particle as moving\nin the conical geometry created by the target. The qualitative features of\n(40) can then be immediately understood from Figure 12. The full eikonal\namplitude for spin\u2013j exchange finally reads [36, 37, 38]\n\u0001j\ns/M 2\n.\n(41)\n1 + iA \u2243 \u22124iM\n(t/M 2 ) + (s/M 2 )2j\u22122 \u2212 i\u01eb\nThis result has been quoted in the literature only for the case j = 2, although\nits derivation easily extends to the case of general j, as shown in the above\nderivation.\nThe eikonal amplitude has a pole at real values of the kinematical invari\u00012j\u22122\nants given by \u2212t = M 2 s/M 2\n. We shall call this pole the 't Hooft pole,\nin analogy with those discussed in [7] for graviton exchange in four dimensions. At the pole, the i\u01eb prescription is obtained by requiring convergence\nof the integral (39) at large values of |x|. One can physically understand\nthis prescription by first noting that, at vanishing coupling and phase\u2013shift,\n(39) gives the S\u2013matrix element\n\u221a \u0001\n\u2212t .\n4\u03c0s \u03b4\n\nThis amplitude corresponds to free propagation of particles, with no inter25\n\n\fFigure 12: Phase shift for a scattering process in the gravitational background\ncreated by the target. In three dimensions,\n\u221a the background geometry is a conical\nspace with deficit angle proportional to s/M . The phase shift \u03b4 is proportional\nto the impact parameter x and is negative.\naction. Using the fact that Im(x \u2212 i\u01eb)\u22121 = \u03c0\u03b4 (x) in the amplitude (41), we\nthen see that the \u03b4\u2013function contribution in the free theory is replaced, in\nthe interacting theory, by\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0001j\u22121 \u0011\n\u0001j\u22121 \u0011\n\u2212t \u2212 M s/M 2\n+ 2\u03c0s \u03b4\n\u2212t + M s/M 2\n.\n2\u03c0s \u03b4\n\nWe conclude that a specific scattering angle, dependent on the energy of the\nprocess, is singled out by the eikonal amplitude. Notice that the pole is in\n\u00012j\u22123\nthe physical eikonal region s \u226b \u2212t whenever s/M 2\n\u226a 1. This shows\nthat gravitons behave quite differently from lower spin particles. In fact,\nfor j = 2, the eikonal approximation is reliable around the 't Hooft pole for\ncenter of mass energies well below the Planck mass.\nWe may now discuss which interaction dominates in the kinematical\nregime of interest in (36). More specifically, we will concentrate on the\ncases j = 0, 1, 2, which arise in standard compactifications of supergravity\ntheories. We will compare the relative importance of the various contributions when the propagator in (36) is on\u2013shell, that is at s = 4pp\u2212 / |w|\nand t = \u22124p2 . We are only interested in an order of magnitude estimate, dropping factors of order unity. Assume that the Kalu\u017ca\u2013Klein charge\nn = p\u2212 / (2\u03c0E) is of order unity and that\nE\u223c\n\nM\n,\nJ\n\nwith J & 1, which is consistent with the quantization condition (5). The\nkinematical invariants are then given by\ns\u223c\n\npM\npE\n\u223c\n,\nw\nwJ\n\n|t| \u223c p2 ,\n26\n\n\fand the basic requirement s \u226b |t| for the eikonal approximation to be valid\nis\nM\np\u226a\n.\nwJ\nWhen this condition is satisfied, the saddle point approximation (32) in the\nprevious subsection is also justified.\nNext we analyze the behavior of the eikonal amplitude (41) for different\nvalues of j. For j = 0, 1, the denominator in (41) is dominated by the second\nterm, whereas for j = 2 the first term dominates. We therefore arrive at the\nfollowing estimates for the amplitudes\n\u0010 p \u00112\u2212j\n\u00012\u2212j\nM\n,\n(j = 0, 1)\n\u226a\nM s/M 2\n\u223c M\nM wJ\n(wJ)4\u22122j\n1 s2\nM t\n\n\u223c\n\nM\n\n(wJ)2\n\n.\n\n(j = 2)\n\nThus, the graviton interaction dominates in the kinematical region of interest. Therefore, from now on, we will only consider the case j = 2.\nUp to this point, we have discussed the amplitude A on\u2013shell, with\ns \u2243 \u2212u. On the other hand, as it is clear from (36), one needs to understand\nthe off\u2013shell extension of the amplitude (41) for generic values of s, u. We\nalso allow in principle for non\u2013vanishing \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 , small compared to s, u. In\nwhat follows, we shall indicate explicitly only the dependence on the \"large\"\nvariables s, u, leaving implicit the dependence on the \"small\" ones t, \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 .\nThe tree level result is simple to compute and gives\n(s \u2212 u)2\n.\n(42)\nMt\nTo understand the off\u2013shell amplitude to all orders, we first rewrite the\non\u2013shell result (41) as follows\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(s \u2212 u)2\n1\n1\n\u221a\n\u221a\nA+ \u2243 \u2212 \u221a\n+\n.\n(43)\n2 \u2212t\ns \u2212 M \u2212t \u2212 i\u01eb u \u2212 M \u2212t \u2212 i\u01eb\n\u221a \u0001\nWe neglect from now on the free propagation term 4\u03c0s\u03b4 \u2212t in the S\u2013\nmatrix element (41) since it does not contribute to the orbifold amplitude\n(36), which is computed at fixed non\u2013vanishing momentum transfer. One\nmay interpret (43) as the exchange, in the s and u channels, of an effective\n\u221a\nparticle of mass squared M \u2212t. Note, however, that the i\u01eb prescription,\nwhich arises from the eikonal result, is opposite to the usual one. Alternatively, recalling that s \u2243 \u2212u on\u2013shell, one rewrites (43) as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n(s \u2212 u)2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n+\nA\u2212 \u2243 \u221a\n,\n2 \u2212t\ns + M \u2212t + i\u01eb u + M \u2212t + i\u01eb\nAtree \u2243 \u2212\n\n27\n\n\fwhich can be viewed as resulting from the exchange of a tachyonic effective\n\u221a\nparticle of mass squared \u2212M \u2212t, with the usual i\u01eb prescription.\nGiven the above observations, we shall assume that the off\u2013shell extension of the eikonal amplitude has poles determined by effective particles with\n\u221a\nmass squared \u00b1M \u2212t. The amplitude A (s, u) therefore has poles placed\nat\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns = M \u2212t + i\u01eb ,\nu = M \u2212t + i\u01eb ,\nand at\n\n\u221a\ns = \u2212M \u2212t \u2212 i\u01eb ,\n\n\u221a\nu = \u2212M \u2212t \u2212 i\u01eb .\n\nWe denote the residues of the amplitude A (s, u) by\n\n\u221a\n\u0001\nRess A s = \u00b1M \u2212t, u = s \u2212 \u03c3\n= f\u00b1 (\u03c3) ,\n\u221a \u0001\nResu A s = u + \u03c3, u = \u00b1M \u2212t = f\u00b1 (\u2212\u03c3) ,\n\nwhere the real functions f\u00b1 are the same at the s and u poles because of s, u\nsymmetry of the amplitude. For later convenience, we expressed the above\nfunctions f\u00b1 in terms of \u03c3 = s \u2212 u.\nIt is important to stress that, in order to compute the orbifold two\u2013point\nfunction and to check the quantization condition (5), we shall only assume\n\u221a\nthat the poles of the eikonal amplitude are placed at s, u = \u00b1M \u2212t, as for\nthe on\u2013shell case. The i\u01eb prescription, on the other hand, is fixed by the\non\u2013shell computation. Finally, the reality of the functions f\u00b1 follows from\nthe fact that, in the absence of discontinuities, field theoretic amplitudes are\nreal.\nA simple example of an off\u2013shell extension of the eikonal amplitude (41),\nsatisfying the above requirements, is\na+ A + + a\u2212 A \u2212 ,\n\n(44)\n\nwith a\u00b1 constant and A\u00b1 as defined above. To match the off\u2013shell tree\u2013level\nresult (42) and the on\u2013shell eikonal amplitude we must have that\na+ + a\u2212 = 1.\n\n4.4\n\n(45)\n\nQuantization condition from unitarity\n\nWe are now in position to finish the computation of the two\u2013point function\nfor a massless scalar field in the orbifold geometry.

The pole denoted\nwith a dot comes from the winding propagator, whereas the poles marked with a\ncross come from the eikonal amplitude A. Recall that s = u+\u03c3, with \u03c3 = 8pp\u2212 /|w|.\nand 4.3, this amounts to evaluating the integral\n\u0393\u00b1\nw\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ni w2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nds\ne \u00b1 4 pE s\n8pp\u2212\n2\nA s, t = \u22124p , u = s \u2212\n,\n2\u03c0i |w| s \u2212 4pp\u2212 + i\u01eb\n|w|\n\n(46)\n\nwhere the amplitude A is dominated by graviton exchange in the eikonal\nregime. The integrand has a pole at s = 4pp\u2212 /w \u2212 i\u01eb, coming from the\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwinding propagator, and poles at s = \u00b1M \u2212t\u00b1i\u01eb and at u = \u00b1M \u2212t\u00b1i\u01eb,\nfrom the eikonal amplitude A. The pole structure of the integrand is shown\nin Figure 13.\nTo compute \u0393+\nw one closes the s\u2013contour in the upper half plane, so that\nthe integral is determined by the poles of A with positive imaginary part at\n\u221a\ns, u = M \u2212t + i\u01eb = 2pM + i\u01eb. The phase in (46) is given at both poles by\nei\n\nw2 M\n2E\n\n, since p\u2212 is quantized in units of 2\u03c0E.

In order for the\ninequality (35) to be valid for all w, we keep p\u2212 fixed and tune p+ so that\np = \u039b/ |w| , for a fixed energy scale \u039b \u226a E. As w \u2192 \u221e, we then have\nthat \u03c3 = 8\u039bp\u2212 /w2 \u2192 0. Note that F+ , F\u2212 and Aon\u2212shell are all analytic\nfunctions of \u03c3, with at most poles and branch cuts. This is clear for (47),\nand it follows from general properties of analyticity of Feynman amplitudes\nw2 M\n\nfor the functions f\u00b1 , and therefore for F\u00b1 . As w \u2192 \u221e, the phase e i 2E\nM\noscillates unless e i 2E = 1, whereas the functions F+ , F\u2212 and Aon\u2212shell have\na regular behavior for \u03c3 \u2192 0. Under mild regularity assumptions, we show4\nin appendix B that, in order for (48) to be satisfied for all values of w, we\nM\nmust have that e i 2E = 1 and therefore that\nM\n\u2208 2\u03c0 Z ,\n2E\nwhich is the quantization condition (5). In this case, we have the additional\nrequirement on the residues\n\u2212F+ + F\u2212 = Aon\u2212shell .\n\n(49)\n\nConsider this last constraint in the case of the off\u2013shell eikonal amplitude\ngiven in example (44). The residue functions f\u00b1 are then explicitly given by\nf\u00b1 (\u03c3) = \u2213a\u00b1\n\n\u03c32\n,\n4p\n\nand we conclude that F\u00b1 = \u2213a\u00b1 Aon\u2212shell . Therefore, condition (49) implies\nthat a+ + a\u2212 = 1, exactly as in (45).\n4\n\nWe thank M. Cornalba for suggesting this argument.\n\n30\n\n\fA few comments are in order. Firstly note that, in the regime of interest,\nall kinematical invariants are much smaller than M/J. Assuming that the\nthree dimensional geometry comes from a ten dimensional string compactification with Planck and string masses, respectively given by M10 and Ms ,\nwe see that string and Kalu\u017ca\u2013Klein effects are irrelevant when JMs \u226b M\nand when J 7/8 M10 \u226b M , which is always true for large charge J.\nSecondly, suppose we use, instead of the full eikonal amplitude A, only\nthe tree level result \u22124s2 /tM for gravitational scattering. Then, the single\ncontribution to the two\u2013point function comes from the pole of the winding\npropagator, violating the reality condition (38). This one\u2013loop violation of\nunitarity is analogous to the one found in the computation of the one\u2013point\nfunction in section 4.1, where the tadpole \u0393 (p) in (28) has support only for\np < 0.\nThirdly, within the eikonal approximation we cannot have a violation of\nthe reality of \u0393p+ , p\u2212 due to intermediate on\u2013shell lines. In fact, the eikonal\ninteraction is essentially transverse [33], with no k+ exchange. Therefore,\nthe scalar lines in Figure 1 have a fixed value of the K+ momentum. It\nis then impossible to cut the graph so that all the cut propagators have\npositive K+ momentum flowing from one part of the graph to the other.\nFinally, note that, although the amplitude (44) is the simplest off\u2013shell\ngeneralization of the on\u2013shell eikonal result, it is quite remarkable that we\nobtain the same constraint on the coefficients a\u00b1 by imposing the condition\n(49) on the residues. This fact clearly deserves a more thorough investigation, which we leave for future work.\n\n5\n\nExtending the results to off\u2013shell external states\n\nWe now generalize the results of the last section to the case of non\u2013vanishing\n\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 .

However, we shall use, for the discussion below, the results of the previous section, which are strictly valid only for small values of \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 . Therefore\nthe following analysis should be considered heuristic and qualitative.\nEquation (51) is reminiscent of a scattering theory problem and is formally solved by\n\u0001\n\u0001\nK \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 = (\u03bb + i\u01eb) \u03b4 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 +\n\n\u03a8=\u03c6\u2212\n\n1\n1\n\u0393p ,p \u03a8 ,\n2\n16\u03c0 E \u03bb 1 + i\u01eb + \u2212\n\n(52)\n\nwhere \u03c6(\u03bb) = \u03b4(\u03bb) is the solution to the free equation of motion.

Therefore, for large J we can solve (52) in powers of\n\u0393p+ ,p\u2212 , with the leading \"Born\" term given by\n\u03a8(\u03bb) \u2243 \u03b4(\u03bb) \u2212\n\n1\n1\n\u0393p ,p (\u03bb, 0) .\n2\n16\u03c0 E \u03bb + i\u01eb + \u2212\n\nIn terms of \u03a8(\u03bb), the dependence of the wave function on the transverse\ncoordinate y is given by\n\u03a8(y) = 2\u03c0\n\n2E\np+\n\n!1 Z\n3\n\nd\u03bb \u03a8(\u03bb) Ai(\u2212z) .\n\nThe normalization has been chosen for later convenience and we recall that\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u00011\n2p+ p\u2212 \u2212 \u03bb\n.\n(53)\nz = 2Ep+2 3 y +\n2Ep+2\n\nUsing the integral representation for the Airy function Ai, we can write \u03a8(y)\nexplicitly as\n1\n\u03a8(y) =\n|p+ |\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bb dk \u03a8(\u03bb) e\n\ni\n2\n2Ep+\n\nh\n\n3\n\n(2Ep+2 y+2p+ p\u2212 \u2212\u03bb)k\u2212 k3\n\ni\n\n.\n\nLet us now use the results of section 5. In particular, the leading contribution to the \u03bb\u2013dependence of \u0393p+ ,p\u2212 comes from the implicit dependence\n33\n\n\fof p on \u03bb within the constant cw in equation (50). Expanding the phase to\nlinear order in \u03bb, and neglecting any other \u03bb\u2013dependence, the expression for\n\u0393p+ ,p\u2212 (\u03bb, 0) is given by\np\n\np\n\n1\n\u03b1 \u2212i 2Ep+2 \u03bb\n\u03b1\u22c6 i 2Ep+2 \u03bb\n\u0393\n(\u03bb,\n0)\n\u2243\ne\ne\n\u2212\n,\np ,p\n16\u03c0 2 E + \u2212\n2\u03c0i\n2\u03c0i\nP\n\u221a\nwhere we compute p = 2p+ p\u2212 and the constant \u03b1 = i (8\u03c0E)\u22121 w6=0 cw \u0393+\nw\n2\nat \u03bb = 0.

In particular, this approximation is valid\naround\ny \u223c 0 since p3 \u226b Ep+2 . For y \u223c 0 the two saddle points at k =\nq\n\u00b1 p2 + 2Ep+2 y are around \u00b1p and the \u03b8\u2013functions create discontinuities.\nMore precisely, we obtain\n(1 + \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u22c6 ) g+ (y) + g\u2212 (y) ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(1 + \u03b1) g+ (y) + g\u2212 (y) ,\n\n(y > 0)\n(y < 0)\n\nwhere g\u00b1 (y) are the left and right moving waves\n3/2\n\u221a\n\u0001\u22121/4 \u00b1 3Epi 2 (p2 +2Ep+2 y)\n+\n,\n\u22132\u03c0iE p2 + 2Ep+2 y\ne\n\u0012\n\u00131/3\n2E\nAi (\u2212z) \u2213 i Bi (\u2212z)\n\u2243 2\u03c0\n,\n|p+ |\n2\n\ng\u00b1 (y) =\n\nwith z given by (53) for \u03bb = 0. The interaction term \u0393p+ ,p\u2212 creates a\ndiscontinuous behavior around y = 0, consistent with the conjectured dual\ndescription in terms of an orientifold plane [13, 11]. Due to the crudeness\nof the approximations involved, these ideas clearly require a more thorough\nanalysis.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nThe propagation of quantum fields in a geometry with closed causal curves\nis not unitary order by order in the coupling constant. This breakdown of\n\n34\n\n\funitarity arises from the interactions of external states with on\u2013shell particle loops that wind the closed causal curves. In this paper we showed that,\nfor a orbifold of three dimensional flat space with closed causal curves, unitarity can be restored for specific values of the Newton coupling constant.\nThe results relied on the eikonal approximation to particle scattering, in a\nkinematic regime where graviton exchange is dominant. Since in the eikonal\napproximation one is able to resum the perturbative series expansion, this\napproximation provides a window to new effects in quantum gravity, such as\nthe quantization of the Newton constant from the unitarity requirement. Alternatively, for fixed coupling constant, one can see this condition as quantizing the orbifold geometry, consistently with the quantization of the extremal\nBTZ black hole angular momentum. Given that a similar condition holds\nfor generic BTZ black holes, the results of this paper may have profound\nimplications for the dynamics of particle states inside black hole horizons.\nWe have used the off\u2013shell extension of the eikonal amplitude for 2 \u2192 2\nscattering in flat space. Although the explicit form of this amplitude is not\nknown, we have only assumed that such extension has the pole structure\nof the on\u2013shell amplitude, compatibly with the symmetries of the amplitude itself. Clearly, it would be desirable to explicitly compute the off\u2013shell\nextension of the amplitude and to check if the additional requirement (49)\nis satisfied. In the usual flat space computation, one needs to deal with\nIR divergences, which in principle can be eliminated by considering eikonal\nscattering in AdS3 . We think this is an interesting direction of research to\npursue, since new connections between quantum gravity in AdS spaces and\ndual CFT's may be derived.\nBased on the particle effective action derived from the orbifold two\u2013point\namplitude for off\u2013shell external states, we gave in the final section a heuristic\nargument showing that particle states are changed precisely at the chronological singularity. This analysis shows that, at finite values of the coupling,\nparticle states are very different from the free particle wave\u2013functions of section 2.2. In fact, free particle states are unstable beyond the chronological\nsingularity. Hence, for zero coupling constant, the condensation of these\nfields will change the geometry in the pathological region of space\u2013time [32].\nIt is plausible that, at the end\u2013point of this transition, the coupling constant is fixed at some fixed value and the geometry is that of a wall placed\nat the chronological singularity. This picture is suggested by a sequence of\nstring dualities that maps the orbifold geometry to an orientifold 8\u2013plane\n\n35\n\n\fand the quantization condition (5) to the quantization of RR charge [11].\nOur computation of the particle effective action, which sees finite coupling\nconstant effects, is also consistent with this picture.\n\n36\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThe authors wish to thank M.

To this end, we will only\nneed to assume that F\u00b1 , A \u2208 F, where F is a class of continuous real\u2013\nvalued functions of a real variable defined on intervals (0, a), a > 0, with the\nfollowing properties:\ni) if f \u2208 F, then either f = 0 or f (\u03c3) 6= 0 for \u03c3 sufficiently close to 0.\nii) if f, g \u2208 F and {\u03c3 w } is a sequence of positive reals converging to\nzero such that f (\u03c3w )/g(\u03c3 w ) is bounded, then f (\u03c3)/g(\u03c3) converges for\n\u03c3 \u2192 0.\niii) if f, g \u2208 F, then f + g \u2208 F.\nAn example of a class of functions satisfying i), ii) and iii) is the one of\nfinite sums of terms xa logn (\u03c3)\u03c6(\u03c3), where a is a real number, n is an integer\n38\n\n\fand \u03c6 is holomorphic on a neighborhood of the origin in C and real on the\nreal axis. This example applies in particular to the case relevant for this\npaper in section 4.4, thanks to general properties of analyticity of scattering\namplitudes.\nWe first assume that \u03b6 6= \u00b11. As shown in section 4.4, the function A is\nnowhere vanishing for \u03c3 6= 0. Therefore, if F+ = 0, reality of the functions\nF\u2212 , A and equation (54) imply that F\u2212 vanishes arbitrarily close to 0, so\nthat F\u2212 = 0 by ii). A similar reasoning applies if F\u2212 = 0. Therefore we can\nassume, by i), that F\u00b1 , A 6= 0 in the range 0 < \u03c3 < 1/W 2 for some W \u2208 N.\n2\nSince \u03b6 6= \u00b11, there are arbitrarily large values of w such that \u03b6 w is not\nreal. We denote with S \u2208 N the set of these values of w which are greater\nthan W . Equating imaginary parts in condition (54) shows that, for w \u2208 S,\n\u0001\n\u0001\nF+ c/w2 = \u2212F\u2212 c/w2 , and hence (54) reduces to\n\u0001\n\u0001\n2\n(w \u2208 S)\n(55)\n2 Re(\u03b6 w )F\u2212 c/w2 = A c/w2 .\nIt follows from condition ii) that the ratios \u00b1A(\u03c3)/F\u2213 (\u03c3) converge for \u03c3 \u2192 0\n(to the same limit). Now we distinguish two cases:\n2\n\na) \u03b6 is a k\u2013th root of unity. If w \u00b1 1 is a multiple of k, then \u03b6 w = \u03b6 and\nw \u2208 S. Thus (55) implies that\n\u00b1 lim\n\n\u03c3\u21920\n\nA(\u03c3)\n= 2 Re(\u03b6) .\nF\u2213 (\u03c3)\n\nOn the other hand, condition (54) for w multiple of k gives\n\u2212 lim\n\n\u03c3\u21920\n\nF\u2212 (\u03c3)\nF+ (\u03c3)\n+ lim\n=1\n\u03c3\u21920 A(\u03c3)\nA(\u03c3)\n\nwhich is incompatible with the above, as \u03b6 6= 1, unless \u03b6 = \u00b1i. In this\n\u0001\nlast case, however, (55) shows that A 1/w2 = 0 for all odd w, which\ncontradicts the result of section 4.4.\n2\n\nb) \u03b6 is not a root of unity. In thisncase\u0010\u03b6 w \u0011o\nis never real for w 6= 0 and\nw2\nconverges to some limit\n(55) shows that the sequence Re \u03b6\n2\n\n2\n\ncos \u03b8. Note, however, that \u03b6 (w+1) = \u03b6 w \u03b6 2w+1 and \u03b6 2w+1 is dense on\nthe unit circle as we vary w. Therefore we can choose w large enough so\n2\nthat Re \u03b6 w is arbitrarily close to cos \u03b8, and so that \u03b6 2w+1 is arbitrarily\nclose to any chosen number \u03be on the unit circle. By choosing \u03be different\n2\nfrom e\u00b12i\u03b8 , we can then make Re \u03b6 (w+1) differ from cos \u03b8 by a finite\namount for\nn arbitrarily\n\u0010 2 \u0011o large values of w, therefore showing that the\ndoes not converge.\nsequence Re \u03b6 w\n39\n\n\fWe finally deal with the case \u03b6 = \u22121. From (54) we deduce that\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2212F+ c/w2 + F\u2212 c/w2 = (\u2212)w A c/w2 .\n\nSince A has constant sign near 0, this relation implies that \u2212F+ (\u03c3) + F\u2212 (\u03c3)\nvanishes arbitrarily close to 0 and is non\u2013vanishing.
