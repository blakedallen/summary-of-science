INTRODUCTION\n\nThe importance of having an accurate distance to the\nAntennae galaxies (NGC 4038/4039) cannot be overstated. These galaxies are the nearest major merger to\nthe Milky Way, and as such, are taken as the archetypal merger system. The proximity makes the Antennae of paramount importance for studying mergers as a\nmodel for hierarchical galaxy formation, as well as providing an ideal setting to explore the physical processes\nin starforming galaxies. For example, the very idea of\nthe formation of exotic objects (e.g., ultra-luminous Xray sources, super -stellar clusters) in mergers owes much\nto studies of the Antennae. Indeed there exists a huge\namount of data collected over the years, from ground\nand space missions, which might be precisely calibrated\nif an accurate distance to the system were available. Recent examples include: GALEX observations (Hibbard et\nElectronic address: isaviane@eso.org\n1 Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is\noperated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., (AURA), under NASA Contract NAS 5-26555.\n\nal. 2005), near-IR WIRC imaging (Brandl et al. 2005);\nChandra ACIS-S (Baldi et al. 2006); STIS data (Whitmore et al. 1995); VLT/ISAAC data (Mengel et al.\n2005); and VLT/VIMOS data (Bastian et al. 2006). We\nalso note the recent Type Ic supernova in the Antennae\n(SN 2004gt, IAUC 8456; Gal-Yam et al. 2005; Maund et\nal. 2005), but the nature of its progenitor remains a subject of debate in part due to the unresolved issue of the\ndistance. Indeed, all basic physical quantities that enter\nthe models (linear distances, masses, and luminosities),\nand hence the model predictions, depend on the adopted\ndistance.\nThe most widely quoted distance to the Antennae is\n\u223c 20 Mpc, based on the recession velocity of the system\ncorrected with the flow model of Tonry et al. (2000).\nHowever values up to \u223c30 Mpc are sometimes quoted\n(e.g., Fabbiano et al. 2001, Zezas & Fabbiano 2002). On\nthe other hand, significantly shorter distance measurements were provided in Rubin et al. (1970) and Saviane,\nHibbard, & Rich (2004; hereafter SHR04). The first of\nthe two studies suggested a distance between 6 and 13\nMpc. The large distance uncertainty is due to the relatively low precision of their adopted distance indicators\n\n\f2\n(the size of H II regions, the brightest stars, and the 1921\nsupernova), as well as to an unknown contribution from\ninternal absorption. Yet they were the first to suggest a\ndistance shorter than that predicted by the redshift.\nThe second study offered a much more accurate measurement of the distance to the Antennae system based\non a standard candle. SHR04 used HST/WFPC2 images to investigate the stellar populations of the candidate tidal dwarf galaxy that lies at and beyond the tip of\nthe southern tidal tail (cf. Schweizer 1978, Mirabel, Dottori, & Lutz 1992). The SHR04 color-magnitude diagram\n(CMD) revealed an apparently spatially extended population of old (age \u2265 2 Gyr) red giants, underlying the\nmore concentrated star-forming regions. The detection\nof such a red giant branch (RGB) population was unexpected, since for an assumed distance of at least 19-20\nMpc, such a population would be fainter than I \u2243 27.5,\nbeyond the detection limit of the SHR04 photometry.\nGiven that all other possible interpretations of this faint\nred stellar population were unsatisfactory, SHR04 assumed that the tip of the RGB (TRGB) had indeed been\nreached. Stellar populations older than \u223c 1\u20132 Gyr develop a well populated red giant branch. The luminosity of the brightest red giants is limited by the ignition\nof helium in the core, under degenerate conditions, the\nso-called helium flash. This luminosity corresponds to\nMI \u223c \u22124 and is known as the red giant branch tip. With\nI\u25e6TRGB \u2243 26.5, and assuming an absolute luminosity of\nMI = \u22124.2 (Carretta et al. 2000), a distance to the Antennae of \u223c13.8 Mpc follows, a value significantly smaller\nthan those previously assumed. Admittedly, in SHR04\nthe TRGB was detected near the completeness limit of\nthe imaging, where large errors and crowding affect the\nprecision of the photometry. It is therefore reasonable to\nrequire confirmation of this shorter distance before it is\nuniversally accepted.\nSuch confirmation was the motivation for the new\nHST/ACS observations presented in this paper, which\nreach significantly fainter magnitudes than the WFPC2\ndata. We use this ACS photometry to derive a firm distance for the Antennae, finding a value consistent with\nthat given in SHR04.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTIONS\n\nACS/WFC observations of the NGC 4038 southern\ntidal tail (GO 10580, P.I. Saviane) were obtained on December 30, 2005, and January 3 and 4, 2006; they were\ncentered at\n(\u03b1, \u03b4)=(12:01:26.511, \u221218:59:21.35) (see Fig. 1). Of the\n7 awarded orbits, 4 were dedicated to deep observations\nthrough the F 606W and 3 through the F 814W filters,\nfor a total integration time of 10870 s and 8136 s, respectively. No cosmic ray split was applied, but the 7 deep exposures were dithered properly so that the frames, when\ncombined via the drizzle process, filled the inter-chip gap\nand allowed removal of the cosmic-ray contamination.\nThe photometric reduction of the final F 606W\nand F 814W images was performed with the\nDaophot/Allstar package (Stetson 1987, 1994).\nThe calibration to the ACS VEGAMAG system was\ndone following the recipes described in Sirianni et al.\n(2005; hereafter S05) and Bedin et al. (2005; hereafter\nB05). The instrumental magnitudes were transformed\nboth to the HST VEGAMAG system, and to the\n\nJohnson-Cousins system. Magnitudes in the VEGAMAG system were obtained by adding the zero-points as\nlisted in B05, and these were dereddened assuming: (i)\nEB\u2212V = 0.046 (see next section); and (ii) the extinction\nratios listed in Table 14 of S05, for a star of spectral type\nG2. For the stars in common with the WFPC2 imaging,\nwe found a 3\u2212\u03c3 clipped mean difference with the ACS\nVEGAMAG I magnitudes of 0.003 \u00b1 0.005 mag. No\ndependence on magnitude for IACS \u2264 26.5 was found.\nThis confirms the excellent consistency of the two scales.\nTo determine the photometric errors and completeness\nof the ACS data, we introduced 20000 artificial stars into\nthe original drizzled images, and reduced and calibrated\nthe frames exactly as was done for the original images\n(see Momany et al. 2005 for a detailed description and\nexample of this process). The CMD of 56600 stars for\nthe whole ACS field-of-view is shown in the left panel of\nFig. 2. The dependence of completeness on stellar color\nis summarized by the plotted iso-completeness lines: we\ncan be confident that in the color range of the RGB all\nstars are measured, while only approximately half of any\nextremely red stars, if they exist, would be recovered.\nNevertheless by looking at the middle and right panels\nof Fig. 2, which are for the areas outside the regions\nof active star formation, one can conclude that very\nfew stars with colors (F 606W \u2212 F 814W ) \u2265 3 exist at\nmagnitudes comparable to the RGB tip. These would\nbe carbon stars along the asymptotic giant branch (see\ne.g., Fig. 6 in Stetson et al. 1998).\n3. FOREGROUND AND INTERNAL REDDENING\n\nIn SHR04 the apparent luminosity of the TRGB was\ncomputed by considering only stars located far from starforming regions. A few triangular areas were picked from\nPC, WF3, and WF4 chips, with the dominant sample\ncoming from the southern portion of WF4 (see Fig. 2\nin that paper). The WF2 area was excluded since it\nis within the H I isodensity contours, while the WF4\nportion is just outside the southernmost contour, which\nmarks a value of 5 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 (Fig. 9 in SHR04). Assuming that internal extinction is negligible in the low\ngas density areas, in SHR04 the tip luminosity was then\ncorrected only for the foreground extinction.\nIn the case of our new ACS data, we expect that the\ninternal extinction is negligible for stars located in the\nnorth-eastern quadrant of the ACS field: Fig. 6 of Hibbard et al. (2001) shows that the H I density is below\nthe detection limit in that area. The apparent luminosity\nof the TRGB was then measured using stars located in\nthat area, which is also far from SF regions, hence yielding a nearly reddening-free measurement of the TRGB.\nOn the other hand, the low stellar density implies a relatively large uncertainty on the tip position. As a further\ncheck, we then repeated the tip detection using stars in\nthe region with the highest stellar density, which is that\ncoincident with the S78 object (cf. inset in Fig. 1). Although this population allows the clearest detection of\nthe TRGB, at the same time it is affected by high extinction due to the high gas and dust density (9\u00d71020 cm\u22122 ),\nso for a proper consistency check, we need to estimate the\nreddening in the S78 region.\nUsing the technique explained below, we found that\nin the dense regions the observed magnitude of the tip is\nindeed 0.16 \u00b1 0.11 mag fainter in the F814W band. From\n\n\f3\nS05 we get AF 814W = 1.825 \u00d7 EB\u2212V for a G2 spectral\nenergy distribution, so we conclude that the internal reddening in the S78 region is EB\u2212V = 0.09 \u00b1 0.06. This is\nroughly consistent with what we expect based on the gas\nand dust column density. The study of Lockman & Condon (2005) finds EB\u2212V = a + b \u00d7 NHI , with two possible\nsolutions: a = 0.0017 mag and b = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221222 mag cm2 ,\nor a = \u22120.0073 mag and b = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221222 mag cm2 . Inserting the H I density of the S78 region in the equations,\nthese yield a reddening comprised between EB\u2212V = 0.09\nand EB\u2212V = 0.13. When compared to the value estimated above, these reddenings suggest that \u223c 30% to\n\u223c 100% of the gas and dust could be in front of the stars.\nIf instead we use the calibration of Bohlin et al. (1978),\nthen the reddening is 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221222 \u00d7 NHI mag cm2 , which\ngives EB\u2212V = 0.15, or \u223c 40% of the gas and dust in front\nof the stars. The foreground reddening to the Antennae\nis EB\u2212V = 0.046 (Schlegel et al. 1998), so the total reddening in the S78 region is then EB\u2212V = 0.14 \u00b1 0.06.\nNote that the color of the RGB in the higher reddening\narea is not significantly different from that in the lower\nreddening area. This is because the expected shift to redder colors (by ca. 0.1 mag) is counter balanced by the\nshift to the blue due to field crowding (the full results\nof the artificial-star experiments will be discussed in the\nmain article dealing with the SFH of the tidal feature).\nThe reddening is also used to calibrate the photometry\n(see previous section), so in principle stellar populations\nof different age and/or spatial location should be calibrated independently. However, since in this study we\nare mainly concerned with the distance, we adopt only\none calibration, which is valid for the old population of\nthe north-eastern quadrant of the ACS field.\n4. DISTANCE\n\nWe measure the distance of the Antennae using the\nluminosity of the TRGB in the I-band, a now well established technique (e.g., Rizzi et al. 2006, and the references therein). By definition the distance modulus is\n\u03bc0 = (m \u2212 M )0 = I TRGB \u2212 MITRGB \u2212 AI , where I TRGB\nis measured on the luminosity function (LF) of the RGB\npopulation, MITRGB is a function of the average metallicity of the RGB population, and AI is the extinction in\nthe I-band. To compute the average metallicity one can\nuse a color-metallicity relation, which gives [Fe/H] as a\nfunction of the color of the RGB measured at some predefined absolute luminosity of the branch. Therefore one\nneeds \u03bc0 , which is the quantity one is trying to compute.\nDistance and metallicity are then computed iteratively,\nstarting from some reasonable guess of \u03bc0 , and working\nuntil convergence (see Sakai et al. 1996). The details of\nthis procedure are the following.\nTo measure the luminosity function (LF) of RGB stars,\nRGB samples were defined by applying two spatial selections, that include only objects in the S78 region or the\nNE quadrant away from star-forming regions (cf. Fig.\n1). The CMDs for these samples of 2800 and 6200 stars\n(NE quadrant and S78 region, respectively) are shown\nin the middle and right panels of Fig. 2. The RGB of\na presumably old (age \u2265 2 Gyr) population is clearly\nevident in these panels (populations younger than \u223c2\nGyr do not generate substantial RGB sequences). This\npopulation most likely arises from the original disk of\n\nNGC 4038. In Fig. 3 we show the luminosity functions of the RGB populations presented in the middle\nand right panels of Fig. 2. The RGB tip is readily visible and application of a Sobel edge-detection filter yields\nF 814W\u25e6TRGB = 26.57\u00b10.09 for the population of the NE\nregion. Here the error is just the formal uncertainty of\nthe method, which depends on the bin size. This value\nmust be corrected for the bias in the observed magnitudes, derived from the artificial star experiments, which\nis 0.05 mag at this luminosity. The corrected value is\nthen F 814W\u25e6TRGB = 26.62 mag. The TRGB luminosity\nand color [(F 606W \u2212 F 814W )\u25e6 = 1.5] were converted\nfrom the VEGAMAG system to the Johnson-Cousins\nsystem, yielding I\u25e6TRGB = 26.65. The observed tip luminosity (i.e., with no bias applied) is 0.1 magnitudes\nfainter than that derived in SHR04. The difference in\nthe two determinations is probably due to the same photometric bias that was found above by means of simulations. The 0.05 mag found here might well turn into\n0.1 mag when working near the photometric limit of the\nWFPC2 dataset.\nAs recalled above, I0TRGB can now be converted into\na distance once MITRGB and [Fe/H] are computed iteratively. The metallicity was determined by comparing the color of the RGB to the fiducial branches of\nGalactic globular clusters taken from B05. The luminosities and colors of the fiducials were computed using\nvalues of the distance moduli and reddenings from Harris (1996; catalog version 2003 February). The [Fe/H]\nof the clusters was then plotted against the color of the\nRGB at MF 814W = \u22123 (cf. Da Costa & Armandroff\n1990). The metallicities were again taken from Harris\n(1996) and a fit was obtained excluding the two clusters at the metallicity extremes (namely NGC 6341 and\nNGC 6528): this ensures that a linear relation is a good\napproximation to the metallicity\u2013color relation in the\nrange of interest. The mean color of the RGB stars\nwas then obtained by selecting stars with luminosities\n\u22123.5 < MF 814W < \u22122.5, and was converted into a mean\nmetallicity by using the relation obtained above, which\nhas a slope \u2206[Fe/H]/\u2206color = 2.64 dex/mag. In this\nway we measure a mean metallicity for the RGB stars\nof h[Fe/H]i = \u22121.17 \u00b1 0.25. The error is dominated by\nthe uncertainty on the distance modulus, and it takes\ninto account the uncertainty on the mean color of the\nRGB, that on the photometric zero point and the reddening determination, and the error on the metallicitycolor calibration. The value of the mean metallicity is\nvalid only if the RGB stars are as old as those in Galactic globular clusters. If they are younger, then since at\nfixed abundance a younger RGB has bluer colours (using\nisochrones from Girardi et al. (2002) we estimate that\nan age decrease of 5 Gyr changes the color of the RGB at\nMF 814W = \u22123 by \u223c0.2 mag) our mean metallicity estimate is actually a lower limit on the true value. With the\nmetallicity-color relation quoted above, we can estimate\na slope of the metallicity-age relation of 0.1 dex/Gyr.\nWe note, however, that Mirabel et al. (1992) measured\na gas-phase oxygen abundance of [O/H] \u2243 \u22120.5 for the\nstar-forming regions in this vicinity, which must be also\nthe metallicity of the current generation of stars. Assuming that the metallicity increases with time, and that\noxygen traces iron, then this value represents an upper\n\n\f4\nlimit to the metallicity of the RGB population.\nTo estimate the absolute luminosity of the TRGB, we\nuse the fact that the mean metallicity of RGB stars\ncomputed above is intermediate between those of \u03c9Cen\nand 47 Tuc. These two clusters are the fixed points of\nthe luminosity-metallicity relation established by Bellazzini et al. (2004), with TRGB luminosities set at\n\u22124.05 \u00b1 0.12 mag and \u22123.91 \u00b1 0.13 mag, respectively.\nNote that, although it is well-know that \u03c9Cen stars have\na range in metallicity, still more than 80% of the cluster\nstars share a common [Fe/H] within 0.2 dex (Suntzeff\n& Kraft 1996, Norris et al. 1996, Hilker et al. 2000),\nhence the cluster suitability as a TRGB calibrator. Since\nthe metallicity of Antennae stars is in the scale of Harris (1996), we adopt [Fe/H]= \u22121.62 dex for \u03c9Cen and\n[Fe/H]= \u22120.79 dex for 47 Tuc. A linear interpolation\nthen yields MIT RGB = \u22123.97 \u00b1 0.13. This luminosity\nvalue is valid only for a population with an age comparable to that of Galactic globular clusters (GGC).\nSince RGB stars in the tidal tail were once part of the\nNGC 4038 disk, it is likely that they have an age spread.\nUsing theoretical models from Girardi et al. (2002)\nwe computed the luminosity spread of the TRGB for\nages greater than 5 Gyr, and metallicities smaller than\n[Fe/H] = \u22120.7, which amounts to 0.07 mag (1\u03c3) in the I\nband. On the other hand the same models show that age\nand metallicity act in opposite directions, so the likely\npresence of an age-metallicity relation will tend to reduce\nthe luminosity variation, and 0.07 mag can be taken as\nan upper limit to the luminosity spread.\nOur firm distance modulus to the Antennae is then\n(m\u2013M)\u25e6 = 30.62 \u00b1 0.17, corresponding to 13.3 \u00b1 1.0 Mpc.\nIn the error budget we have included the error in the\naperture correction (0.005 mag), the zero-point error of\nthe VEGAMAG photometric system (0.02 mag) and the\nerror on the reddening, the uncertainty in the tip position in the LF (0.09 mag), the error in the HST-Johnson\ntransformation (0.03 mag), an uncertainty of 0.05 mag\nto account for a possible age spread, and finally the error\non the absolute magnitude of the tip (0.13 mag).\nBefore comparing our new value of the distance to that\nobtained in SHR04, the Population II distance scale must\nbe discussed. Traditionally the tip luminosity in the Iband was taken as MITRGB \u2248 \u22124.0 (e.g Da Costa &\nArmandroff 1990), with a mild dependence on the metallicity. However, after Hipparcos released the catalog of\nparallaxes for subdwarf stars in the solar vicinity, the\ntraditional Pop II distance scale was revised. By fitting\nglobular clusters' main sequences to subdwarf sequences,\nCarretta et al. (2000) suggested that the so-called 'long'\ndistance scale was favored by the new data. This means\nthat Galactic globular clusters' distance moduli are on\naverage \u223c0.2 mag greater than traditional values, and\nhence the RGB tip luminosity is greater by the same\namount. In SHR04 such a distance scale was adopted,\nwhich led to a distance of 13.8 Mpc for the Antennae.\nHowever, more recent calibrations of the Pop II distance\nscale seem to be moving back to 'short' distances. For\nexample, in the case of 47 Tuc Zoccali et al. (2001)\nfind (m \u2212 M )\u25e6 = 13.27 \u00b1 0.14 by fitting the cluster's\nwhite dwarf (WD) cooling sequence to local WDs with\nmeasured parallaxes, and Bellazzini et al. (2004) have\nrecently published a TRGB luminosity calibration where\n\nthey adopt (m \u2212 M )\u25e6 = 13.31 \u00b1 0.14 for 47 Tuc. The\nnewer distances are then shorter by \u223c 0.2 mag compared\nto Carretta et al. (2000), and Gratton et al. (2003). In\nthis paper we adopt the more recent distance scale, but if\nwe adopted the tip luminosity of SHR04, the distance of\nthe Antennae would be 14.6 Mpc, fully compatible with\nour previously derived value of 13.8 \u00b1 1.7 Mpc.\nNote that, although the distance we measure strictly\napplies only to stars in the southern tail of the Antennae, it can be safely used for the whole system. In fact\nadopting the distance of this paper, the numerical model\nthat was matched to the H I kinematics in Hibbard et\nal. (2001), gives a maximum tidal extent (tip to tip, in\nreal space) of 90 kpc. The maximum line-of-sight depth\nis 36 kpc (tip of N tail to base of N disk). The maximum\nline-of-sight depth between our pointing and anywhere\nelse in the system is 16 kpc (tip of southern tail to base\nof N disk). If we adopt 100 kpc as an upper limit to the\nmaximum line-of-sight depth, then the distance modulus to any other region of the Antennae will be less than\n0.02 mag different from the one we measure.\nFor distances of the order of 13 Mpc, the recession velocity for the Antennae differs from that inferred from\nthe flow model of Tonry et al. (2000) by approximately\n500 km s\u22121 . The model predicts a peculiar velocity dispersion of 187 km s\u22121 , so this difference from the model\nis not extreme, being at the level of 2.7 \u03c3. We note also\nthat a similar difference is present for another galaxy\nnear the position of the Antennae; in Fig. 11 of Tonry et\nal. (2000) there is an object near the Antennae that has\na radial velocity \u223c 300 km s\u22121 larger than the model\nprediction. Moreover, objects near the Antennae are beginning to fall within the gravitational influence of the\nGreat Attractor (GA), and the quoted figure in Tonry et\nal. (2000) shows several other objects with large residual\nvelocities pointing toward the GA. Thus we believe our\nnew distance does not generate any significant discrepancies with the observed recession velocity of the Antennae\nsystem.\n5. DISCUSSION\n\nWith our new HST/ACS imaging of the tidal tail region studied in SHR04, more than two magnitudes of\nthe red-giant branch of an old (age \u2265 2 Gyr) population\nis readily visible. The resulting clear detection of the\nred-giant branch tip confirms the short distance found in\nthe earlier paper. The downward revision of the distance\nto the Antennae has far reaching scientific implications:\nsome of these are discussed in SHR04, and an update is\ngiven here.\n5.1. Young massive clusters\n\nAn immediate implication is that the linear scales of,\ne.g., Antennae clusters are reduced by a considerable factor, which depends on the distance adopted in the original study. For example, using two different techniques\nWhitmore et al. (1999) estimated a median effective radius of reff = 4 \u00b1 1 pc and 4.6 \u00b1 0.4 pc for the young\nclusters. This is larger than the median reff of globular\nclusters in the Milky Way (\u223c 3 pc, see van den Bergh\n1996), and of clusters in nearby starburst galaxies (2\u2013\n3 pc, see Meurer et al. 1995). With the shorter distance all linear dimensions are reduced by a factor 1.4,\n\n\f5\nso the radii quoted above become 2.8 pc and 3.2 pc, respectively. Therefore the size of the clusters formed as\na consequence of the Antennae merger now agree with\nthose of well-studied objects in the nearby Universe, and\nwith reff \u2248 3\u20136 pc for clusters created in other mergers\n(Schweizer et al. 1996; Miller et al. 1997; Whitmore et\nal. 1997; Carlson et al. 1998).\nMoreover all luminosities are reduced by a factor of\n\u223c 2 compared to the most commonly quoted distance of\n19.2 Mpc. Thus, along with the reduction factor of 1.4\nin linear scales, this implies a smaller projected length\nfor the tails while the radial velocities would remain unchanged, leading to a shorter timescale for the interaction\n(Hibbard et al. 2001). The luminous to dynamical mass\nestimate for the tidal dwarf candidates (Hibbard et al.\n2001) would be 1.4 times lower (Mlum /Mdyn \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.5),\nimplying a more significant dark-matter content, as recently inferred for other tidal dwarfs (Bournaud et al.\n2007).\nObservations of advanced stages of mergers has lead\nto the idea that the end product of a disk-disk encounter\ncould be a giant elliptical (E) galaxy (Toomre & Toomre\n1972; Toomre 1977; Schweizer 1987). However there are\ntwo problems with this idea, both related to the presence of rich globular cluster (GC) populations around E\ngalaxies. The first problem is that E galaxies have higher\nspecific frequencies SN of GCs (number of clusters per\nunit luminosity, see Harris & van den Bergh 1981) compared to spiral galaxies (van den Bergh 1982). While\nmassive disk galaxies have SN \u223c 1, Es have SN \u223c 2\u20135\ndepending on the environment (e.g., Brodie & Strader\n2006). The second problem is that the mass function\n(MF) of GCs is log-normal (i.e., Gaussian when plotted\nvs. the logarithm of the mass), while young massive clusters show power-law MFs with exponents close to \u03b1 = \u22122\n(Elmegreen & Efremov 1997, Hunter et al. 2003, Bik et\nal. 2003, De Grijs et al. 2003, Zhang & Fall 1999). These\ntwo issues are discussed more thoroughly in the following\nsections.\n5.1.1. Specific frequency\n\nThe fact that new clusters are formed in mergers, as\nfirst shown by HST observations of NGC 1275 (Holtzman et al. 1992), suggests that they could increase SN\nas long as new clusters are formed with higher efficiency\nwith respect to field stars, compared to that of the primordial cluster population of the interacting disks. In\nthe case of the Antennae, Whitmore & Schweizer (1995)\nestimated that Nt > 700 new clusters have been formed\nin the interaction, and that in a Hubble time the system\nwill fade from MV = \u221223 to MV = \u221221.5. By definition SN = Nt 100.4(MV +15) , so with the above parameters SN = 1.8 for the system. Our new distance modulus is 1.7 magnitudes shorter than (m \u2212 M )0 = 32.3\nadopted by Whitmore & Schweizer (1995), so with a\nfainter MV = \u221219.8, the frequency becomes SN = 8.4.\nThis is comparable even to Es with the richest cluster\nsystems, so it might appear that SN is not a problem in\nthe case of the Antennae. However it is difficult to attach an uncertainty to this number. On one hand, a substantial number of clusters is below the detection limit,\nand more clusters will be formed in the future perigalactic passages, so SN seems underestimated. But on the\nother hand a large fraction of clusters will be destroyed\n\nby internal and external dynamical processes (see e.g.,\nBastian & Gieles 2007), and this will drive SN down. To\ngain some insight we can look at merger remnants, which\nshould represent the future evolution of the Antennae. In\nthe case of NGC 7252 Miller et al. (1997) find SN = 2.5\nafter 15 Gyr of fading, and a post-fading SN = 2.9 is\ncomputed in Schweizer et al. (1996) for NGC 3921. So\nit is possible that the net effect of the cluster evolution\nwill be to reduce the SN of the Antennae, but thanks to\nits presently high value, the final value might well still\nbe compatible with that of a field elliptical galaxy. Note\nthat about two thirds of the clusters should be destroyed,\nwhich is compatible with the results of Vesperini (2000).\n5.1.2. Mass function\n\nIt is been observed that the LF of young-massive clusters (YMC) can be represented by two power-laws of different slope (Whitmore et al. 1999), and with a bend\nat MV \u2248 \u221210.4. This is discussed in the scenario of\nthe possible transformation of an initial power-law MF\ninto a log-normal MF via destruction of the lower mass\nclusters. Adopting 10 Myr for the age, and using solar\nmetallicity models from Bruzual & Charlot 2003, they\nfind that the bend corresponds to 105 M\u2299 . Although the\npeak of the MF for GCs in the Milky Way is at a higher\nmass of \u2248 2 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 , Whitmore et al. (1999) claim\nthat, given the uncertainties on the location of the bend\nand on the M/L ratio given by the models, the two mass\nvalues are compatible. Therefore the proposal is that selective destruction of clusters less massive than the peak\nshould eventually lead to a GC-compatible, log-normal\nMF, as proposed by Fall & Zhang (2001). With a shorter\ndistance, the change of slope of the broken power-law of\nWhitmore et al. (1999) is at \u223c 4 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 , which makes\nits identification with the MF peak of old Galactic GCs\nless likely. Moreover Zhang & Fall (1999), modeling the\nage distribution of YMCs find that the MF is a powerlaw of \u03b1 = \u22122, with no signs of a break. They interpret\nthe bend in the LF as an effect of a MF truncated at\n106 M\u2299 , and of the fading of the more massive clusters.\nNote also that cluster destruction would leave behind a\npower-law LF with \u03b1 = \u22122 in the brightest part, and a\nshallower LF in the fainter part, while Whitmore et al.\n(1999) find that \u03b1 = \u22122 in the fainter part, and a steeper\nLF in the brightest part, which can indeed be interpreted\nas an effect of fading (Gieles et al. 2006).\nIf the MF is a power-law, then a change of distance\nonly affects the mass of the most massive clusters generated by the merger. Assuming a distance of 28.8 Mpc\nWhitmore & Schweizer (1995) found that the cluster luminosity function ends at MV \u2243 \u221215.5, which translates\ninto a mass of \u2243 107 M\u2299 . Old Galactic GCs have average logarithmic mass < log(M ) >= 5.3 and a dispersion \u03c3log M = 0.49 dex (e.g., Brodie & Strader 2006), so\nthe largest clusters in the Antennae would be 3.5\u03c3 larger\nthan the (logarithmic) average mass of Galactic GCs, and\nthe most massive young clusters in the Antennae would\nbe almost twice as massive than their counterparts in\nthe Milky Way. Since massive clusters are not destroyed,\nthis would pose another problem for the merger-induced\nformation of globular clusters. Instead with the new distance the most massive clusters in the Antennae have\nmasses of \u2248 2 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 , which is well within the mass\nlimits of Galactic GCs.\n\n\f6\nAlthough the models of Fall & Zhang (2001) can transform a power-law MF into a log-normal one, this happens only with a restricted set of parameters. Instead\nthe simulations of Vesperini (2000) have shown that an\ninitial log-normal MF stays log-normal for large variations of the initial conditions, and the average mass and\ndispersion tend to reach those of old GCs after a few\nGyr of dynamical evolution. This is despite the fact\nthat \u223c 50% of the clusters are destroyed in the process.\nThis convergence would explain why the GC MF is almost universal. In this respect, some investigations have\nwarned that log-normal and power-law mass (or luminosity) functions are significantly different only at the\nfaint end, where they are usually hard to determine due\nto incompleteness of the data (e.g., Anders et al. 2007).\nThe Antennae are a particularly important case, since\ntheir YMC population is one of the youngest (only a few\ntens of Myr old), so it can tell us what is the shape of\nthe MF of merger-induced clusters at the very beginning.\nWith a different analysis of the HST imaging presented\nin Whitmore et al. (1999), a new LF was obtained by\nAnders et al. (2007) and converted into a MF assuming\nan average age of 25 Myr and solar metallicity. They\nfound that a log-normal function provides a better fit,\nwith < log(M ) >= 4.2 and \u03c3M = 0.85 dex (and assuming again 19.2 Mpc distance). With a shorter distance the average mass of Anders et al. (2007) becomes\n< log(M/M\u2299 ) >= 3.9, so more dynamical evolution is\nrequired to shift it to a value comparable to old GCs.\nWhile an initial log-normal MF would be appealing, preliminary results, based on new and deeper HST/ACS\nimaging, seem to show that the MF is a power-law even\npast the older detection threshold (Whitmore 2006). So\nthe issue of GC creation in mergers is still open. Either\nconditions in the primordial Universe made clusters with\na characteristic mass, and today they do not. Or clusters are always born with power-law MFs which evolve\nto log-normal. A definite answer will need more realistic\nsimulations of cluster evolution in a time-variable potential like that of a merger. Note also that evolution of the\ncluster MF has perhaps been detected in intermediateage mergers like NGC 1316 and NGC 3610 (Goudfrooij\net al. 2004; Goudfrooij et al. 2007).\n5.2. SN 2004gt\n\nSN 2004gt is of great interest because its presence in\nthe Antennae may permit the strongest yet constraints\non the progenitor of Type Ic SNe. It is currently debated\nwhether the progenitors of these SNe are high-mass single\nstars or intermediate-mass stars in a binary system (see\nbelow), and since a small fraction of type Ic SNe are associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRB, e.g., Bloom et al.\n1999; Stanek et al. 2003; Hjorth et al. 2003; Malesani\net al. 2004; Pian et al. 2006), being able to discriminate between these two hypothesis is of great interest\nfor GRB models as well. Indeed no progenitor of a type\nIc SN has ever been found, and we only have upper luminosity limits for five stars (see Table 1 in Maund et\nal. 2005). Although SNe of type Ic have been identified in galaxies closer than the Antennae, the depth of\nHST archival images permits to reach fainter absolute\nmagnitudes. Nevertheless both Maund et al. (2005) and\nGal-Yam et al. (2005) failed to find the progenitor of\nSN2004gt, and only upper limits could be established.\n\nStill these limits are fainter than all previous determinations, and consequently place the strongest constraints\non possible candidates.\nThe first study adopted a conventional 19.2 Mpc distance, while the second one used the shorter 13.8 Mpc\ndistance established in SHR04. With the distance proposed in this paper (which is only < 4% smaller than\nour previous one) the results of Maund et al. (2005) can\nbe put in better agreement with those of Gal-Yam et al.\n(2005), as we now show. The conclusion of Gal-Yam et\nal. (2005) is that the progenitor of SN2004gt, if a WolfRayet (WR) star, must have belonged to one of the more\nevolved types. This is because as a WR star evolves and\nits envelope gets progressively stripped, it becomes hotter and fainter (see, e.g., the tracks plotted in Maund et\nal. 2005), and all progenitors brighter than 1.25 \u00d7 104 L\u2299\nin the V band (MV > \u22125.2) are excluded by Gal-Yam et\nal. (2005). So the progenitor of SN2004gt must have\nbeen of type WNE (where the products of hydrogenburning through CNO-cycle are exposed), or WC/WO\n(where the products of helium burning are exposed). See\nMaeder & Conti (1994) for more details.\nThe approach of Maund et al. (2005) was to perform\na direct comparison with stellar tracks from the Geneva\ngroup, computed with a prescription for mass loss. The\nmagnitude and color limits of their photometry were converted into a limit in bolometric luminosity dependent on\nthe effective temperature, and all stars having their endpoint evolution fainter than that limit were accepted as\nviable progenitors. The permitted Hertzsprung-Russell\ndiagram region is that of relatively faint and blue stars,\nso all red supergiants are excluded, in agreement with the\nresult of Gal-Yam et al. (2005) illustrated above. The\nend points of 60 and 85M\u2299 stars do reach this region\nof luminosities smaller than \u223c 105 L\u2299 and temperatures\ngreater than \u223c 30, 000K while 40M\u2299 and 120M\u2299 tracks\nare always too luminous. Adopting 13.3 Mpc, all luminosities become 0.3 dex smaller, and all WR evolutionary\nend-points are above the detection threshold, and thus in\nprinciple should be excluded. However WR stars fainter\nthan the limit computed by Maund et al. (2005) do\nexist (see Vacca & Torres-Dodgen 1990), so our shorter\ndistance reveals an inconsistency in one of the thresholds\ncomputed by Maund et al. (2005). Indeed the luminosity limits for the hottest stars are more uncertain due to\nthe particular approximation for the WR spectral energy\ndistribution that was adopted, and to the uncertainties\non the bolometric corrections (Maund, priv. comm.). So\nat 13.3 Mpc progenitors of 40 M\u2299 could still be possible.\nThe general conclusion is then that both Maund et\nal. (2005) and Gal-Yam et al. (2005) support a type Ic\nprogenitor which is a WR star of the most evolved types,\nand with a main-sequence mass in the lowest range of\nthese wind-dominated stars (see, e.g., Maeder & Conti\n1994 for a review). However, an alternative scenario for\nSNe Ic is an origin from a star of lower mass than a\nWR, and in a binary system. In that case the envelope\nis stripped through interaction with its companion (see\nPods et al. 2004 and references therein). This possibility\ncannot be constrained by the SN in the Antennae, so this\nissue is still open.\n5.3. Star formation induced by the merger\n\n\f7\nThe Antennae is often used as an example of the kind\nof 'violent' processes occurring in mergers. For example,\nSanders & Mirabel (1996) include this system in their\ncompilation of Luminous Infrared Galaxies, which owe\ntheir high IR luminosity to a starburst. This is a class\nof galaxies whose total IR luminosity exceeds 1011 L\u2299 :\naccording to Vigroux et al. (1996), who assumed a distance of 20 Mpc, this is precisely the IR luminosity of\nthe Antennae. Since the total IR luminosity is now\n\u223c 4 \u00d7 1010 L\u2299 , the Antennae should be classified in the\nregime of normal galaxies. This is perhaps not surprising,\nsince most interacting galaxies have normal IR luminosities (Bushouse et al. 1988). And in particular the Antennae are the object opening the so-called Toomre sequence\n(Toomre 1977), so the star-formation rate (SFR) is not\nexpected to be that of the more advanced stages. Indeed Charmandaris et al. (2000) studied the SFR along\na modified Toomre sequence, as traced by the 15 \u03bcm to\n7 \u03bcm flux ratio, and found that the ratio is small for\ngalaxies in early stages of interaction, it increases by a\nfactor of \u223c 5 in merging/starburst systems, and it goes\nback to pre-starburst values in merger remnants. Although the Antennae was not part of the sequence studied by Charmandaris et al. (2000), the low IR luminosity\ndeduced here is in line with the low SFR expected for a\nmerger in its earliest stages.\nAnother, indirect confirmation of this is the fact that,\nthanks to the shorter distance, the luminosity function of the X-ray sources (XLF) in the Antennae becomes comparable with that of M82. The most recent XLF is presented in Zezas & Fabbiano (2007),\nand it is a power-law reaching maximum luminosities of\nlog Lmax\n\u2243 39.8 erg sec\u22121 in the 0.1\u201310.0 keV band, for\nX\nan assumed 19 Mpc distance. The maximum luminosity becomes log Lmax\n\u2243 39.5 erg sec\u22121 after subtracting\nX\n0.3 dex, which is the factor of 2 reduction in luminosity\nimplied by our shorter distance. This means that Lmax\nX\nis close to that of the XLF of M82 (e.g., Zezas & Fabbiano 2002), which also has a similar slope. The highluminosity tail of the XLF is populated by high-mass\nX-ray binaries, which are a signature of a young stellar\npopulation. The similarity of the XLFs of the Antennae\nand M82 means that the underlying stellar population\nhas comparable age, i.e. that the strength of the ongoing SF is also comparable. The SFR per unit area\n\nof M82 is comparable to that of NGC 520 (Kennicutt\n1998), which is classified as pre-starburst in the modified Toomre sequence of Charmandaris et al. (2000). So\nwe might infer that the SFR in the Antennae is also\ncomparable to that of NGC 520 and M82, in turn a\nsign of an early merger stage. In fact another consequence of the reduced distance is that the number of\nso-called ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULX; those exceeding 1039 erg cm\u22122 sec\u22121 ) become comparable to the\nnumber of ULXs found in NGC 520. Eighteen ULXs\nwere found by Zezas & Fabbiano (2002) in the Antennae, for a distance of 29 Mpc. With our distance, these\nbecome six which is a number closer to the three\u2013four\nULX sources detected by Read et al. (2005) in NGC 520.\nThe maximum X-ray luminosities quoted above are also\ncomfortably small: indeed Zezas & Fabbiano (2007) find\nthat even luminosities up to 1040 erg cm\u22122 sec\u22121 can\nbe radiated by a black-hole of \u223c 80 M\u2299 , which in turn\ncan be the end-point of normal stellar evolution in a binary system. In fact Zezas & Fabbiano (2007) propose to\nmove the limit of ULX sources above log LX = 40, since\nonly above such luminosities a non-standard scenario is\nrequired (like an intermediate-mass black hole or beamed\nradiation).\nIn summary, with the shorter distance determined\nhere, the Antennae remain a spectacular system, but it is\nno longer an extreme merger in terms of its consequences\n(star-burst luminosity, cluster population, X-ray sources,\netc). A full appreciation of the properties of this system\nin light of our new firm distance will have significant implications for many areas of Astronomy.\n\nThis paper has been completed thanks to a stay of\nY.M. at ESO/Chile (through a Director General grant\nto I.S.) and a stay of I.S. at Mt Stromlo Observatory, supported both by ESO (through the same DG\ngrant) and the Australia National University (grant ARC\nDP0343156).

The star-forming regions are evident but a large fraction of the frame is evidently free of active star formation. In the inset the\nlow-luminosity regions are enhanced to show the tidal feature identified by Schweizer (1978) beyond the tip of the tail. The feature is\nmarked by the ellipse and the label 'S78'. The outline shows the location of the WFPC2 field studied in SHR04. The field of view is\n3.\u2032 5 \u00d7 3.\u2032 5.\n\n\f10\n\nFig. 2.- True luminosity vs. true color (obtained by removing only the foreground extinction and reddening) of stars in different regions\nof the tidal tail. The left panel displays the ACS/WFC F 814W\u25e6 vs. (F 606W \u2212 F 814W )\u25e6 CMD for the entire ACS field. All stars with\nabsolute Sharp values less than 0.35 are plotted. Colored lines show the 10% (red), 30% (blue) and 50% (green) completeness levels.\nThe photometric errors in magnitude and color are indicated by blue crosses in the center panel. Both are derived from artificial star\nexperiments. Isochrones from the Padova Library in the VEGAMAG system are plotted as well, for a metallicity Z = 0.004 and ages of\n8, 80, and 224 Myr. Post turnoff phases are drawn with a thinner line. The middle panel displays the CMD for stars in the S78 region,\nand the right panel that of stars in the NE quadrant. The luminosity of the red giant branch tip, as detected in the NE quadrant, is\nmarked by the horizontal segments in the center and right panels: stars in the S78 region are fainter and redder due to the presence of\ndust in that area. Overplotted in the right panel are fiducial ridge lines of Galactic globular clusters in the VEGAMAG system (from\nBedin et al. 2005). The clusters are (left to right): NGC6341, NGC6752, NGC104 (47Tuc), NGC5927, NGC6528 whose metallicities are:\n[Fe/H]=\u22122.28, \u22121.56, \u22120.76, \u22120.37 and \u22120.04, respectively.\n\n\f11\n\nFig. 3.- The luminosity functions of the RGB populations from the NE and S78 regions are shown by the shaded histograms in the upper\nand lower panel, respectively. The LF of the S78 population has been corrected for the additional 0.16 magnitudes of internal absorption.\nProcessing the LFs with a Sobel kernel filter yields the dashed curves, and in both panels, the arrow marks the RGB tip level, given by the\npeak at the highest luminosity of the filtered LFs. If the distance was approximately 20 Mpc, as usually assumed in the literature, then\nthe RGB tip level should be at the luminosity marked by the dotted arrow, and this is clearly ruled out by our data. The solid histogram\nin the lower panel is the LF of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy (from Saviane et al. 2000), and the agreement between the LFs is a\nfurther hint of the old age of the S78 population. The discontinuity at F 814W0 \u2248 27.5 in the LF of the NE population could be due to the\nRGB of a younger, \u223c 200 Myr population (see previous figure).\n\n\f"}
