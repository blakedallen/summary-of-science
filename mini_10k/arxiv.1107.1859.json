Introduction\nThe following result\n'We prove that a complex hyperbolic non-elementary Kleinian group G acting on two-dimensional\ncomplex hyperbolic space H2C is R-Fuchsian, that is, G leaves invariant a totally real plane in H2C ,\nif and only if every loxodromic element of G is either hyperbolic or loxodromic whose elliptic part is of\norder 2.'\nis announced at http://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/events/Meetings/LMS/2011/GAL11/program.pdf as a\ncontent of a one-hour talk.\nThe assertion as it stands is wrong (see a C-Fuchsian counter-example in Section 3). The following\ntheorem directly implies a corrected statement.\nTheorem. Let V be a C-linear space equipped with a hermitian form h\u2212, \u2212i of signature + + \u2212 and\nlet G \u2264 SU V be a subgroup such that the trace tr g of every loxodromic element g \u2208 G belongs to R\u03b4g ,\nwhere \u03b4g3 = 1. Suppose that G contains a loxodromic element. Then either there exists a 1-dimensional\nG-stable C-subspace in V or there exists a totally real 3-dimensional G-stable R-subspace in V .\n2. Proof of Theorem\nWe assume that there is no 1-dimensional G-stable C-subspace in V .\n2.1. First, suppose that tr G \u2282 R.\n\b\nLet W \u2264 V be a G-stable R-subspace in V . Then the C-subspaces CW , W \u2229 iW , and W \u22a5 := v \u2208\nV | hv, W i = 0 are obviously G-stable. It follows that dimR W cannot equal\n\u2022 1 because, otherwise, CW is a 1-dimensional G-stable C-subspace in V ;\n\u2022 2 because, otherwise, dimC CW equals 1 or 2 and, in the latter case, dimC W \u22a5 = 1;\n\u2022 4 because, otherwise, either W is a complex subspace with dimC W \u22a5 = 1 or W + iW = CW = V and\ndimR (W \u2229 iW ) = 2, that is, dimC (W \u2229 iW ) = 1;\n\u2022 5 because, otherwise, W + iW = CW = V and dimR (W \u2229 iW ) = 4, that is, dimC (W \u2229 iW ) = 2.\nSuppose that dimR W = 3. Let g \u2208 G be loxodromic. The eigenvalues of g are 1, r\u22121 , r, where\n0, \u00b11 6= r \u2208 R. Denote by e0 , e1 , e2 \u2208 V the corresponding eigenvectors, where e0 is positive and\northogonal to the isotropic e1 , e2 such that c := he1 , e2 i =\n6 0. Since W \u2229 iW = 0, there is no C-subspace\nin W . Therefore, dimR (W \u2229 Cei ) \u2264 1. On the other hand, since the characteristic polynomial of g\nequals (x \u2212 1)(x \u2212 r\u22121 )(x \u2212 r), there is a basis of eigenvectors of g in W . Thus, we can assume that\ne0 , e1 , e2 \u2208 W . Clearly, W is totally real if c \u2208 R. Suppose that c \u2208\n/ R. Then ImhW, wi = 0 for\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 57M50 (57S25).\n\n\f2\n\nw \u2208 W is equivalent to w \u2208 Re0 . For any h \u2208 G, we have 0 = ImhW, e0 i = ImhhW, he0 i = ImhW, he0 i.\nSo, Ge0 \u2282 Re0 . A contradiction.\nSuppose that V has no proper G-stable R-subspaces. Let A := RG denote the real span of G and\nD := EndA V denote the division R-algebra of endomorphisms of the simple A-module V (Schur's\nlemma). By Artin-Wedderburn theorem, a quotient algebra of A is isomorphic to End VD . Since\ndimR V = 6, we have D = R and dimR End VD = 36 or D = C and dimC End VD = 9. On the other\nhand, A \u2264 EndC V and dimC EndC V = 9. Hence, A = EndC V , which contradicts tr A \u2282 R.\n2.2. Without loss of generality, we can assume that G contains a nontrivial cubic root of unity. Then\nthere\ng \u0015\u2208 R. In a suitable basis e0 , e1 , e2 with the Gram matrix\n\u0014 1 0 0 \u0015exists a loxodromic g \u2208 G with\n\u0014 1 tr\n0 0\n0 0 1 , such a g has the form g := 0 r \u22121 0 , where 0, \u00b11 6= r \u2208 R.\n010\n\n0\n\n0\n\nr\n\n2.3. Remark. Let g\u0014 \u2208 G\u0015be loxodromic with tr g \u2208 R and let e0 , e1 , e2 \u2208 V be eigenvectors of g\n10 0\nwith the Gram matrix 0 0 1 . Then, for every h \u2208 G, there exists a cubic root of unity \u03b4 such that\n01 0\n\nhhe0 , e0 i, hhe1 , e2 i, hhe2 , e1 i, tr(g n h) \u2208 R\u03b4 for all n \u2208 Z.\n\nProof. It is easy to see that tr(g n h) = hhe0 , e0 i + r\u2212n hhe1 , e2 i + rn hhe2 , e1 i. If hhe1 , e2 i 6= 0 or\nhhe2 , e1 i =\n6 0, then g n h is loxodromic for sufficiently large |n|. Therefore, hhe\u00140 , e0 i, hhe1 , e2\u0015i, hhe2 , e1 i \u2208\n\u2212\u03b5\u22122\n\n0\n\n0\n\nR\u03b4 for a suitable cubic root of unity \u03b4. If hhe1 , e2 i = hhe2 , e1 i = 0, then h =\n0\n0 a\u03b5 with a > 0\n0 a\u22121 \u03b5 0\n\u0014 \u22124\n\u0015\n\u03b5\n0 0\nand |\u03b5| = 1. Since h2 =\nand hh2 e1 , e2 i = hh2 e2 , e1 i = \u03b52 6= 0, we obtain \u03b52 \u2208 R\u03b4, where\n0 \u03b52 0\n0\n\n0 \u03b52\n\n\u03b4 3 = 1. Again, we get hhe0 , e0 i, hhe1 , e2 i, hhe2 , e1 i \u2208 R\u03b4\n\n\u0004\n\n2.4. Lemma. Let g, h \u2208 G be loxodromic with tr g, tr h \u2208 R. Then tr(gh) \u2208 R.\n\u00141 0 0\u0015\nProof. In some bases e0 , e1 , e2 and f0 , f1 , f2 with Gram matrix 0 0 1 , we respectively have g =\n0 10\n\u00141 0 0\u0015\n\u00141 0 0\u0015\n\u22121\n\u22121\n0r\n0 and h = 0 s\n0 , where 0, \u00b11 6= r, s \u2208 R. Let gij := hei , fj i. Then ei = gi0 f0 + gi2 f1 + gi1 f2\n0\n\n0\n\nr\n\n0\n\n0\n\ns\n\nfor i = 0, 1, 2. By Remark 2.3, for every n \u2208 Z, there exists some cubic root of unity \u03b4n such that\nhhn e0 , e0 i, hhn e1 , e2 i, hhn e2 , e1 i \u2208 R\u03b4n . Taking \u03b4 such that \u03b4n = \u03b4 for infinitely many n's, from\nhhn e0 , e0 i = g00 g 00 + s\u2212n g02 g 01 + sn g01 g02 ,\nhhn e1 , e2 i = g10 g 20 + s\u2212n g12 g21 + sn g11 g 22 ,\n\nhhn e2 , e1 i = g20 g10 + s\u2212n g22 g 11 + sn g21 g12 ,\n\nwe obtain\ng00 g00 , g02 g 01 , g01 g 02 , g10 g20 , g12 g21 , g11 g 22 , g20 g 10 , g22 g11 , g21 g12 \u2208 R\u03b4.\nIf g11 g 22 = 0, then e2 =\n6 e1 = f1 6= f2 or e1 6= e2 = f2 6= f1 (the equalities and inequalities are meant in\nthe projective sense). Hence, g12 g21 6= 0. We conclude that \u03b4 = 1 \u0004\n2.5. Lemma. Let g, h1 , h2 \u2208 G be such that g is loxodromic and tr g, tr(g n h1 ), tr(g n h2 ) \u2208 R for all\nn \u2208 Z. Then tr(g n h\u22121\n1 h2 ) \u2208 R for all n \u2208 Z.\nProof. Using the symmetry between h1 , h2 and replacing h1 , h2 by g k h1 , g k h2 , if necessary,\n\u0015\n\u0014 we can as-\n\nsume (as in the proof of Remark 2.3) that h2 is loxodromic unless both h1 , h2 have the type\n\n\u00b11 0\n0\n0\n0 a\u03b5\n0 a\u22121 \u03b5 0\n\nin the basis related to g, where a > 0 and \u03b52 = \u22131. In this particular case, h1\u22121 h2 is diagonal with\ncoefficients in R \u222a Ri. By Remark 2.3, for some cubic root of unity \u03b4, we have tr(g n h\u22121\n1 h2 ) \u2208 R\u03b4 for all\nn \u2208 Z. Therefore, the mentioned coefficients have to be real.\n\n\f3\n\nSo, we assume that h2 is loxodromic with tr h2 \u2208 R. Suppose that tr(g n h\u22121\n1 h2 ) \u2208 R\u03b4 for all n \u2208 Z,\nwhere \u03b4 3 = 1 and \u03b4 6= 1. For some m \u2208 Z, we have 0 6= tr(g m h\u22121\n1 h2 ) \u2208 R\u03b4 as, otherwise, we are done.\nn\nm \u22121\nHence, by Remark 2.3, tr(g m h\u22121\n1 h2 ) \u2208 R\u03b4 for all n \u2208 Z. In particular, tr(g h1 ) \u2208 R\u03b4, which implies\nm \u22121\ntr(g h1 ) = 0.\nSuppose that g k h\u22121\n1 is loxodromic for some k \u2208 Z. As in the proof of Remark 2.3, we conclude that\nn \u22121\ng h1 is loxodromic for all sufficiently large/small n. By Lemma 2.4, tr(g n h\u22121\n1 h2 ) \u2208 R for all such n's,\nimplying tr(g n h\u22121\nh\n)\n=\n0,\na\ncontradiction.\n2\n1\n\u0014\n\u0015\nSo, h\u22121\n1 is of the type\n\n\u00b11 0\n0\n0\n0 a\u03b5\n\u22121\n0 a \u03b5 0\n\n. This contradicts tr(g m h\u22121\n1 )= 0\n\n\u0004\n\n\b\n2.6. By Lemma 2.5, H := h \u2208 G | tr(g n h) \u2208 R for all n \u2208 Z is a subgroup in G. Obviously, G is\ngenerated by H and the cubic roots of unity. It suffices to deal with H in place of G. In other words,\nwe can assume that tr G \u2282 R.\n3. Counter-example\nLet \u2206(c, p6 , q7 ) be a geodesic triangle in the hyperbolic\nplane\nwith the corresponding interior angles \u03c05 , \u03c05 , \u03c02 . The\nq1\nq8\n\u03c0\np\n8\n. Taking 10 congruent trianarea of this triangle equals 10\nq2\nq7\ngles\nwith\ncommon\nvertex\nc,\nwe\nobtain a pentagon with area\nq13\nq9 c\np6 area(p , p , p , p , p ) = \u03c0.

Note that, by the\n\u0010\nhx, qi \u0011\nq4\nq5\nq .\ndefinition from [ABG], we have R(q)x := i x \u2212 2\nhq, qi\nDenote Q(q) := \u2212iR(q) (in the complex hyperbolic plane, Q(q) \u2208 SU V ). We consider 3 more\ncopies of the pentagon P (q6 , q7 , q8 , q9 , q10 ), namely: P (q5 , q10 , q9 , q12 , q11 ), P (q4 , q11 , q12 , q13 , q14 ), and\nP (q1 , q2 , q3 , q14 , q13 ). The geodesics G \u227aq9 , q10 \u227b and G \u227aq11 , q12 \u227b are ultraparallel (this can be shown\nwith the help of SEs; see [ABG]). The geodesics of this type separate the four pentagons,\nso that\u0015we\n\u0014\np7\n\nhave exactly what is drawn on the picture. Since Q(q10 )Q(q9 )Q(q8 )Q(q7 )Q(q6 ) =\n\u0014 \u22121 0 0 \u0015\n0 \u2213i 0\nand Q(q)Q(q) = 1 in SU V , we have\n0\n\n\u22121\n0\n0\n0 \u00b1(\u2212i)5\n0\n0\n0\n\u00b1(\u2212i)5\n\n=\n\n0 \u2213i\n\n1=\n\n\u0015\n0 0 4\n0 \u2213i 0\n0 0 \u2213i\n\n\u0014 \u22121\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n= Q(q8 )Q(q7 )Q(q6 )Q(q10 )Q(q9 ) * Q(q9 )Q(q10 )Q(q5 )Q(q11 )Q(q12 ) *\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n* Q(q12 )Q(q11 )Q(q4 )Q(q14 )Q(q13 ) * Q(q13 )Q(q14 )Q(q3 )Q(q2 )Q(q1 ) =\n= Q(q8 )Q(q7 )Q(q6 )Q(q5 )Q(q4 )Q(q3 )Q(q2 )Q(q1 ).\n\nBy [ABG], we obtain a C-Fuchsian faithful and discrete representation of H8 and, hence, a C-Fuchsian\nfaithful and discrete representation of the fundamental group G8 of a surface of genus 3. As G8 consists\nof all\u0014 words of\u0015even length in the Q(qi )'s, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, every element I \u2208 G8 has the form\nI=\n\n1 0\n0\n0 r \u22121 \u03b1 0\n0 0 r\u03b1\n\nin a suitable basis e0 , e1 , e2 , where e1 , e2 are isotropic points in the complex geodesic,\n\ne0 is its polar point, r > 0, and |\u03b1| = 1. Since I \u2208 SU V , we obtain \u03b1 = \u00b11.\n4. References\n\u2032\n\n[ABG] S. Anan in, E. C. Bento Gon\u00e7alves, A hyperelliptic view on Teichm\u00fcller space.
