Below 9.5 K, the anomalously large decrease\nof the linewidth reveals the stabilization of a long-range ordered state with one chirality.\n\n1\n\n\fGeometrically frustrated magnets are currently attracting intensive research interest in\nthe context of condensed-matter physics.1 Combined effects of quantum fluctuations and\nhighly degenerate states lead to exotic ground states, a vortex-induced topological order, a\nlong-range order in a higher-order degree of freedom such as scalar or vector chiral orders,\nquantum criticality as well as exotic low-lying excitations.2\u201310\nThe simplest example of the frustrated antiferromagnets is found in the two-dimensional\n(2D) triangular lattice.11 For the nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Heisenberg triangular\nsystem, the ground state is given by a 120\u25e6 antiferromagnetic order.12\u201314 This invokes the\nnotion of a vector spin chirality, which provides a conceptual framework for understanding\nphase transitions on the triangular lattices.\nAmong the triangular lattices the iron-based langasite Ba3 NbFe3 Si2 O14 (BNFSO) is the\nfocus of research interest due to its novel magnetic and multiferroic properties.15,16,19\u201323\nBNFSO has a non-centrosymmetric trigonal structure belonging to the P321 space group.\nThe Fe3+ ions (S=5/2) form isolated triangular lattices on a hexagonal lattice, which are\narranged to form 2D triangular lattices in the ab plane. The neighboring planes are separated by layers containing Ba and Nb cations. A magnetic ordering occurs below the N\u00e9el\ntemperature TN = 27 K despite a large Curie-Weiss temperature of \u0398W = \u2212173 K, signifying substantial frustration. The intratriangle interaction of J1 \u2248 9.9 K is mediated by\nsuperexchange via oxygen anions forming the tetrahedral coordination. The intertriangle\ninteraction of J2 \u2248 2.8 K in the ab plane is mediated by two oxygens (super-superexchange).\nBesides, a set of interplane exchange pathways are needed to stabilize the helical spin structure along the c axis with the period 1/\u03c4 \u2248 7. Even without applying an external field chiral\ndynamics is observed from spin-wave excitations of the helically modulated 120\u25e6 magnetic\norder.22 This means that BNFSO is a rare example possessing both a triangular chirality\nand a helical chirality in a single lattice.\nNeutron scattering experiments reveal a multi-step magnetic ordering process towards a\nsingle chirality phase.16 Vortices ordering is considered to play a crucial role in relation to the\nmultiferroic properties. Frustrated magnets show a many-sided face, depending on the timeand spacescales of employed spectroscopic methods. Thus, it is important to investigate a\nspin and chirality ordering process using a different time window from neutron scattering. ac\nsusceptibility and electron spin resonance (ESR) are a complimentary experimental choice\nbecause the former can probe a slow spin dynamics while the latter is sensitive to fast\n2\n\n\fshort-range spin correlations.\nIn this brief report, we present evidence for the spin-glass-like slow spin dynamics by\nac susceptibility, and for the persistence of short-range correlated spin chirality states well\ndown to TN by ESR. The simultaneous observation of the slow and the fast spin dynamics\nmight be the characteristic feature of frustrated magnets with a large spin value and spin\nchirality.\nSingle crystals of BNFSO were grown using the travelling-solvent floating-zone technique\nas described elsewhere.15 The crystals were characterized using X-ray diffraction, magnetic\nsusceptibility, specific heat, thermal conductivity, neutron scattering, dielectric and polarization measurements.15,16 ac susceptibility measurements were performed as a function of\ntemperature using a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS) in a frequency range\n\u03bd = 1 \u2212 1000 Hz in an ac field of 3 Oe and zero dc magnetic field. The high frequencyESR spectra were obtained on the ESR spectrometers at the National High Magnetic Field\nLaboratory. The temperature dependence was measured using a homodyne/transmission\nspectrometer at \u03bd = 100 GHz.17,18\nFigure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the ac susceptibility taken in zero dc\nmagnetic field. With decreasing temperature the real part of the ac susceptibility, \u03c7\u2032 (T ),\nfor \u03bd = 1 Hz exhibits a round maximum at 39 K and then a kink around TN \u223c 27 K. With\nincreasing frequency, the maximum shifts to higher temperature and decreases in amplitude.\nThe kink at TN evolves into a sharp peak without changing the position. This feature is due\nto critical fluctuations accompanying a transition to the N\u00e9el ordered state.\nThe imaginary part of the ac susceptibility, \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (T ) also exhibits appreciable frequency\ndependence between 20 K and 100 K. The loss peak of \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (T ) is visible for \u03bd = 1 Hz at\n32 K, which is 7 K lower than that in \u03c7\u2032 (T ). With increasing \u03bd, the peak undergoes a shift\nto higher temperatures. and the peak width broadens. In contrast to \u03c7\u2032 (T ), there is no\ndecrease in amplitude. Overall, these features are reminiscent of a spin-glass-like behavior\nor superparamagnetism. However, it should be discriminated from conventional spin glasses\ndue to the following reasons.\nFirst, the dc susceptibility does not show any round maximum in contrast to the ac\nsusceptibility. Second, the magnitude of the frequency shift is much larger than what is\nexpected for canonical spin glasses. We used the well-defined peak position of \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (T ) to\nestimate the shift of the ac susceptibility as a function of frequency (see the inset of Fig. 1).\n3\n\n\f380\n\n3\n\n= 0\nlog( )\n\n' (emu/mol)\n\nH\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n360\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nT (K)\nf\n\nT\n\nC\n\n340\n9\n\n1 Hz\n\n\" (emu/mol)\n\n10 Hz\n100 Hz\n\n6\n\n1000 Hz\n\n3\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\nT (K)\n\n100\n\nFIG. 1: Temperature dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the ac susceptibility at frequencies \u03bd = 1, 10, 100, and 1000 Hz without external dc field. With increasing frequency the ac\nsusceptibility curve shifts to higher temperatures (see the arrow). Inset: Frequency shift of the\npeak position of the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility versus temperature.\n\nThe curve shifts by as much as 30 K on varying the frequency from 1 Hz to 1000 Hz. From\nthe maximal shift \u2206Tf we obtain the value of \u03c6 = \u2206T /Tf \u2206(log\u03bd) \u223c 0.16. This value is\nmuch bigger than that of a spin glass, which is typically the order of 10\u22122 .24 The large \u03c6 is\ncompatible to some sort of superparamagnetism.\nSimilar features have been reported in pyrochlores and spin-chain compound Ca3 CoIrO6\nwith magnetic frustration.25,26 This suggests that the strong frequency dependence of the\nac susceptibility originates from a slow spin dynamics pertaining to geometrically frustrated\nmagnets, akin to superparamagnetism.\nIn addition to the observed slow spin dynamics, the 2D triangular antiferromagnets are\ncharacterized by fast short-range magnetic correlations over a space scale of a spin trimer.\n\n4\n\n\fDerivative of ESR Absorption (arb. units)\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n3 K\n6 K\n10 K\n13 K\n16 K\n19 K\n22 K\n23 K\n24 K\n25 K\n26 K\n35 K\n50 K\n100 K\n200 K\n\n= 100 GHz\n\n0\n\n300 K\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nH (T)\n\nFIG. 2: Derivative of the ESR absorption of the BNFSO sample measured at \u03bd = 100 GHz as a\nfunction of temperature.

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the ESR spectra measured at\n100 GHz. At room temperature, a narrow single Lorentzian line is observed, originating\nfrom Fe3+ (3d5; S = 5/2) ions. The g-factor is close to the free spin value as expected from\na half-filled (3d5 ) shell. With decreasing temperature the spectrum undergoes a broadening\nand a shift to lower fields. In addition to the main signal, at low temperatures extra peaks\nshow up. Their peak positions do not change with temperature and their intensities show a\nCurie-like behavior. Thus, they are ascribed to a few percentage of impurities or parasitic\nphases. Hereafter, we will focus on the main signal. To detail the evolution of the spectrum,\nthe resonance field (Hres ) and the ESR linewidth (\u2206Hpp ) are extracted by fitting the spectra\nto a derivative of Lorentzian profiles.

See the text for details.\n\nin Fig. 3.\nWe observe intriguing features in the temperature dependence. For temperatures above\n30 K (T > TN ), \u2206Hpp increases gradually with lowering temperature while Hres hardly\nvaries with temperature. At temperatures between 30 K and TC2 = 14 K, the linewidth\nincreases enormously and the resonance field shifts strongly toward lower fields. In the short\ntemperature interval between TC1 = 9.5 K and TC2 both \u2206Hpp and Hres show no apparent\ntemperature dependence. Finally, for temperatures below TC1 , Hres does not change with\ntemperature while \u2206Hpp drops but it remains at a large value even at the lowest temperature.\nTo analyze quantitatively the temperature dependence of the linewidth, \u2206Hpp is plotted\nin a log-log scale as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. We find the weak power law dependence,\n\u2206Hpp \u221d T \u2212p with p = 0.8 for T > 30 K and the strong temperature dependence with\np = 1.8 between TC2 and TN .\nFor conventional magnets, the linewidth is temperature independent in a high-\n\n6\n\n\ftemperature paramagnetic regime and starts to broaden in the vicinity of magnetic ordering\ntemperature. In contrast, frustrated magnets exhibit significant temperature dependence of\nthe linewidth in a wide temperature range reaching up to a dozen times the ordering temperature. It is due to short-range spin correlations over a spin cluster unit. In our case, the\nneutron experiments demonstrated the persistence of correlated magnetic scattering with a\nvector chiral component up to 100 K23 and the presence of diffuse scattering at an order of\nthe Curie-Weiss temperature, \u0398W .16 Noticeably, the 2D triangular-lattice NiGa2 S4 with a\nlow spin value S=1 showed pronounced T-dependence of \u2206Hpp with the critical exponent\np = 2.5.27 The observed smaller exponent for BNFSO suggests that the spin dynamics and\ncritical fluctuations of the studied compound are in proximity to the classical limit due to\na larger spin value S = 5/2. This might be responsible for the observation of the slow spin\ndynamics by ac susceptibility.\nAn unconventional feature is seen as temperature approaches TN . The large shift of Hres\nto a lower field for T < TN implies the development of an internal magnetic field. This is\nwhat is expected for a magnetically ordered state. Instead of the expected line narrowing,\nhowever, the linewidth shows a critical broadening \u2206Hpp \u221d T \u2212p with p = 1.8, which starts\nat about 30 K, higher than TN and persists down to 14 K. The onset temperature reminds us\nof the temperature scale of 40 K, at which the neutron measurements show a development\nof long-range correlations and the heat capacity and thermal-conductivity measurements\nshow broad anomalies.15,16 In addition, the neutron scattering study revealed the presence\nof the diffusive scattering down to 20 K, which is close to TC2 . This feature is ascribed to\nthe coexistence of short-range ordered spin clusters within the helically ordered state as has\nbeen reported for other frustrated magnets.28 In our case, it might be due to spin clusters\nof opposite chirality generated by defects and impurities.\nIn a magnetically ordered state the ESR linewidth is determined by four magnon scattering processes and an occupation number of magnon excitations. Thus, with lowering\ntemperature the linewidth decreases with a power law. BNFSO shows the drop of \u2206Hpp at\nabout TC1 \u2248 9.5 K. This suggests that a true long-range ordered state with one chirality\nsets in at TC1 . However, the large linewidth at the lowest temperature of 3 K indicates that\nthere are the significant fluctuations of the uniform spin chirality in the measured time scale\nof \u03bd = 100 GHz. Finally, we turn to the transit temperature interval between TC1 and TC2 .\nThis rather flat feature in \u2206Hpp seems to indicate the competition between the narrowing\n7\n\n\fand the broadening mechanism. Unlike the S=1 triangular compound NiGa2 S4 , we find no\nhint for the bound state of a Z2 vortex.\nIn summary, we have presented a combined ac susceptibility and ESR study of\nBa3 NbFe3 Si2 O14 . We observe a spin-glass-like behavior of the ac susceptibility in a wide\ntemperature range of 20 - 100 K, but with much larger Mydosh parameter, suggesting superparamagnet due to locally ordered clusters. The ESR measurements reveal the persistence\nof a short-range correlated state to a long-range ordered one. The concomitant occurrence\nof frustration related slow and fast spin dynamics might be a generic feature of frustrated\nmagnets with a large spin value and a well-defined spin chirality. For more quantitative\nunderstanding, we need systematic studies of the spin dynamics in the 103 \u2212 1011 s\u22121 .\nNational High Magnetic Field Laboratory is supported by NSF Cooperative Agreement\nNo. DMR-0654118, and by the State of Florida.
