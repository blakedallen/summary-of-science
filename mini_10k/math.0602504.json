Temperley-Lieb algebras have been generalized to web spaces for rank 2 simple\nLie algebras. Using these webs, we find a complete description of the Jones-Wenzl idempotents for the quantum sl(3) and sp(4) by single clasp expansions. We discuss applications\nof these expansions.\n\n1. Introduction\nAfter the discovery of the Jones polynomial [9,10], its generalizations have been studied in\nmany different ways. Using the quantum sl(2) representation theory, the Jones polynomial\ncan be seen as a polynomial invariant of a colored link whose components are colored by\nthe two dimensional vector representation of the quantum sl(2). By using all irreducible\nrepresentations of the quantum sl(2), one can find the colored Jones polynomial and it has\nbeen extensively studied [5, 11, 19, 26, 35, 38].\nThe other direction is to use the representation theory of other complex simple Lie algebras from the original work of Reshetikhin and Turaev [30, 31]. These quantized simple Lie\nalgebras invariants can be found by using the Jones-Wenzl idempotents and fundamental\nrepresentations. In this philosophy, Kuperberg introduced web spaces of simple Lie algebras\nof rank 2, sl(3), sp(4) and G2 as generalizations of Temperley-Lieb algebras corresponding\nto sl(2) [21]. Then he successively generalized the result for sl(2) [32] that the dimension\nof the invariant subspace of the tensor of irreducible representations of the quantum sl(3)\nand sp(4) is equal to the dimension of web spaces of the given boundary with respect to the\nrelations in Figure 5 and Figure 12 respectively [21]. But there was no immediate generalization to other Lie algebras until new results for so(7) [37] and sl(4) [17]. The quantum\nsl(3) invariants have many interesting results [1, 2, 12, 13, 28, 34] also have been generalized\nto the quantum sl(n) [8, 14, 27, 33, 39]. An excellent review can be found in [6].\nOhtsuki and Yamada generalized Jones-Wenzl idempotents (these were called magic weaving elements) for the quantum sl(3) web spaces by taking the expansions in Proposition 3.1\nand 3.4 as a definition of clasps [28]. On the other hand, Kuperberg abstractly proved the\nexistence of generalized Jones-Wenzl idempotents for other simple Lie algebras of rank 2,\nhe called clasps [21]. In the recursive formula shown in Figure 1, the resulting webs have\ntwo (one with one clasp) clasps, thus it is called a double clasps expansion of the clasp of\nweight n. There is an expansion for which each resulting web has just one clasp as depicted\nin Figure 3 [5]. We called it a single clasp expansion of the clasp of weight n. These\nexpansions are very powerful tools for graphical calculus [5, 15, 35]. We provide single clasp\nexpansions of all quantum sl(3) clasps together with double, quadruple clasps expansions of\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 57M27; Secondary 57M25, 57R56.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDONGSEOK KIM\n\nall quantum sl(3) clasps. We also find single and double clasp expansions of some quantum\nsp(4) clasps.\nUsing expansions of clasps, Lickorish first found a quantum sl(2) invariants of 3-manifolds\n[23,24]. Ohtsuki and Yamada did for the quantum sl(3) [28] and Yokota found for the quantum sl(n) [39]. For applications of single clasp expansions, first we provide a criterion which\ndetermines the periodicity of a link using colored quantum sl(3) and sp(4) link invariants.\nWe discuss a generalization of 3j, 6j symbols for the quantum sl(3) representation theory.\nAt last, we review how sl(3) invariants extend for a special class of graphs.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we review the original Jones-Wenzl\nidempotents and provide some algebraic background of the representation theory of sl(3)\nand sp(4). We provide single clasp expansions of all clasps for the quantum sl(3) in section 3.\nIn section 4 we study single clasp expansions of some clasps for the quantum sp(4). In\nsection 5, we will discuss some applications of the quantum sl(3) clasps and their single\nclasp expansions. In section 6, we prove two key lemmas.\nA part of the article is from the author's Ph. D. thesis. Precisely, section 3 and 6 are\nfrom [15, section 2.3] and section 4 is from [15, section 2.4].\n\nAcknowledgements The author would like to thank Greg Kuperberg for introducing the\nsubject and advising the thesis, Mikhail Khovanov, Jaeun Lee and Myungsoo Seo for their\nattention to this work.

Jones-Wenzl idempotents and algebraic back ground\nFor standard terms and notations for representation theory, we refer to [4].\n2.1. Jones-Wenzl idempotents. An explicit algebraic definition of Jones-Wenzl idempotents can be found in [5]. We will recall a definition of Jones-Wenzl idempotents which can\nbe generalized for other simple Lie algebras. Let Tn be the n-th Temperley-Lieb algebra\nwith generators, 1, e1 , e2 , . . . , en\u22121 , and relations,\n1\n\n1\n\ne2i = \u2212(q 2 + q \u2212 2 )ei ,\nei ej = ej ei\nei = ei ei\u00b11 ei .\n\nif |i \u2212 j| \u2265 2,\n\nFor each n, the algebra Tn has an idempotent fn such that fn x = xfn = \u01eb(x)fn for all\nx \u2208 Tn , where \u01eb is an augmentation. These idempotents were first discovered by Jones [9]\nand Wenzl [36]. They found a recursive formula:\nfn = fn\u22121 +\n\n[n \u2212 1]\nfn\u22121 en\u22121 fn\u22121 ,\n[n]\n\n\fJONES-WENZL IDEMPOTENTS\n\n3\n\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n\nn\n\n+\n\n=\nn\n\n[n \u2212 1]\n[n]\n\nn\u22122\n\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n\nFigure 1.

It has the following properties\n1) it is an idempotent 2) fn ei = 0 = ei fn where ei is a U-turn from the i-th to the i + 1-th\nstring as shown in Figure 2. The second property is called the annihilation axiom. We will\ndiscuss the importance of Jones-Wenzl idempotents in section 2.4. In Figure 3, n stands\nfor the number of strings and \"i\" stands for i-th string from the right. We will use this\nconvention for the rest of the article.\n2.2. The representation theory of sl(3). The Lie algebra sl(3) is the set of all 3 \u00d7 3\ncomplex matrices with trace zero, which is an 8 dimensional vector space with the Lie\nbracket. Let \u03bbi be a fundamental dominant weight of sl(3), i = 1, 2. All finite dimensional\nirreducible representation of sl(3) are determined by its highest weight \u03bb = a\u03bb1 + b\u03bb2 ,\ndenoted by V\u03bb where a and b are all nonnegative integers. We will abbreviate Va\u03bb1 +b\u03bb2\nby V (a, b). The dimension and the quantum dimension of the fundamental representation\nV\u03bb1 \u223c\n= (V\u03bb2 )\u2217 of sl(3) are 3, [3]. The weight space of a fundamental representation V (1, 0)\nis [1, 0], [\u22121, 1] and [0, \u22121]. The weight space of a fundamental representation V (0, 1) is\n[0, 1], [1, \u22121] and [\u22121, 0]. Thus, one can easily find the following decomposition formula for\na tensor product of a fundamental representation and an irreducible representation,\n\n\f4\n\nDONGSEOK KIM\n\nV\u03bb1 \u2297 Va\u03bb1 +b\u03bb2\nV\u03bb2 \u2297 Va\u03bb1 +b\u03bb2\n\n\u223c\n= V(a+1)\u03bb1 +b\u03bb2 \u2295 V(a\u22121)\u03bb1 +(b+1)\u03bb2 \u2295 Va\u03bb1 +(b\u22121)\u03bb2 ,\n\u223c\n= Va\u03bb1 +(b+1)\u03bb2 \u2295 V(a+1)\u03bb1 +(b\u22121)\u03bb2 \u2295 V(a\u22121)\u03bb1 +b\u03bb2 ,\n\nwith a standard reflection rule, a refined version of the Brauer's theorem [7, pp.142]. Using\nthese tensor rules, one can find the following lemma.\nLemma 2.1. For integers a, b \u2265 1,\ndim(Inv(V\u03bb\u2297a\n\u2297 V\u03bb\u2297b\n\u2297 V(b\u22121)\u03bb1 +a\u03bb2 )) = ab.\n1\n2\n\nTo compare the weight of cut paths and clasps, we recall the usual partial ordering of the\nweight lattice of sl(3) as\na\u03bb1 + b\u03bb2 \u227b (a + 1)\u03bb1 + (b \u2212 2)\u03bb2 ,\na\u03bb1 + b\u03bb2 \u227b (a \u2212 2)\u03bb1 + (b + 1)\u03bb2 .\n2.3. The representation theory of sp(4). The Lie algebra sp(4) is the set of all 4 \u00d7 4\ncomplex matrices of the following form,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nA B\n, where t B = B,t C = C\nC \u2212t A\nwhich is a 10 dimensional vector space with the Lie bracket, where A, B and C are 2\u00d72 matrices. Let \u03bbi be a fundamental dominant weight of sp(4), i = 1, 2. All finite dimensional\nirreducible representation of sp(4) are determined by its highest weight \u03bb = a\u03bb1 + b\u03bb2 ,\ndenoted by V\u03bb where a and b are all nonnegative integers. We will abbreviate Va\u03bb1 +b\u03bb2\nby V (a, b). The dimension and the quantum dimension of the fundamental representation\nV\u03bb1 (V\u03bb2 ) of sp(4) are 4, [4](5, [5], respectively). The weight space of a fundamental representation V (1, 0) is [1, 0], [\u22121, 1], [1, \u22121] and [\u22121, 0]. The weight space of a fundamental\nrepresentation V (0, 1) is [0, 1], [0, \u22121], [2, \u22121], [\u22122, 1] and [0, 0]. Thus, one can easily find\nthe following decomposition formula for a tensor product of a fundamental representation\nand an irreducible representation,\nV\u03bb1 \u2297 Va\u03bb1 +b\u03bb2\nV\u03bb2 \u2297 Va\u03bb1 +b\u03bb2\n\n\u223c\n= V(a+1)\u03bb1 +b\u03bb2 \u2295 V(a\u22121)\u03bb1 +(b+1)\u03bb2 \u2295 V(a+1)\u03bb1 +(b\u22121)\u03bb2 \u2295 V(a\u22121)\u03bb1 +b\u03bb2 ,\n\u223c\n= Va\u03bb1 +(b+1)\u03bb2 \u2295 Va\u03bb1 +(b\u22121)\u03bb2 \u2295 V(a\u22122)\u03bb1 +(b+1)\u03bb2 \u2295 V(a+2)\u03bb1 +(b\u22121)\u03bb2 \u2295 Va\u03bb1 +b\u03bb2 ,\n\nwith a similar reflection rule. Using these tensor rules, one can find the following two\nlemmas.\nLemma 2.2.

Invariant vector spaces and Web spaces. In this subsection, we briefly review\nthe web spaces, full details can be found in [21]. Let Vi be an irreducible representation of\ncomplex simple Lie algebras g. One of classical invariant problems is to characterize the\nvector space of invariant tensors\nInv(V1 \u2297 V2 \u2297 . . . \u2297 Vn ),\ntogether with algebraic structures such as tensor products, cyclic permutations and contractions. The dimension of such a vector space is given by Cartan-Weyl character theory;\ndim(Inv(V1 \u2297 V2 \u2297 . . . \u2297 Vn )) is the number of copies of the trivial representation in the\ndecomposition of V1 \u2297 V2 \u2297 . . . \u2297 Vn into irreducible representations. For this algebraic\nspace, we look for a geometric counterpart which can preserve the algebraic structure of\nthe invariant spaces. The discovery of quantum groups opens the door for the link between\ninvariant spaces and topological invariants of links and manifolds. For quantum sl(2), the\ndimension of the invariant spaces of V1\u22972n is the dimension of the n\u2212th Temperley-Lieb\nalgebra as a vector space which is generated by chord diagrams with 2n marked points on\nthe boundary of the disk where V1 is the vector representation of sl(2). In particular, this\nspace is free, i.e., there is no relation between chord diagrams. To represent any irreducible\nrepresentations other than the vector representation, we use Jones-Wenzl idempotents as\nwe described in section 2.1. Then all webs in the web space of a tensor of irreducible\nP repre\u2297 k ik\nand\nsentations Vi1 \u2297 Vi2 \u2297 . . . \u2297 Vin can be obtained from webs in the web space of V1\nby attaching Jones-Wenzl idempotents of weight ik along the boundary (some webs become\nzero by the annihilation axiom, no longer a basis for web space and the other nonzero webs\nare called basis webs), where Vi is the irreducible representation of the quantum sl(2) of\nhighest weight i and k = 1, 2, . . . , n. For example [21], the web\n\n\f6\n\nDONGSEOK KIM\n\n,\nFigure 4. Generators of the quantum sl(3) web space.\n(1)\n\n= [3]\n\n(2)\n\n= \u2212[2]\n\n(3)\n\n=\n\n+\n\nFigure 5.

Each diagrams appears in a geometric counterpart of\nthe invariant vectors is called a web, precisely a directed and weighted cubic planar graph.\nUnfortunately, some of webs are no longer linearly independent for simple Lie algebra other\nthan sl(2). For example, we look at the web space of sl(3) representations. Let V\u03bb1 be the\nvector representation of the quantum sl(3) and V\u03bb2 be the dual representation of V\u03bb1 . The\nweb space of a fixed boundary (a sequence of V\u03bb1 and V\u03bb2 ) is a vector space spanned by the\nall webs of the given boundary which is generated by the webs in Figure 4 (as inward and\noutward arrows) modulo by the subspace spanned by the equation of diagrams which are\ncalled a complete set of the relations, equations 1, 2 and 3 as illustrated in Figure 5. We\nhave drawn a web in Figure 6. We might use the notation +, \u2212 for V\u03bb1 , V\u03bb2 but it should\nbe clear. For several reasons, such as the positivity and the integrality [22], we use \u2212[2] in\nrelation 2 but one can use a quantum integer [2] and get an independent result. If one uses\n[2], one can rewrite all results in here by multiplying each trivalent vertex by the complex\nnumber i.\n\n\fJONES-WENZL IDEMPOTENTS\n\n7\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\u2212\n\n+\n\nFigure 6.

An example of the annihilation axiom with a cut path.\n\nTo define the generalization of Jones-Wenzl idempotents, clasps, we first generalize the\nannihilation axiom for other web spaces. We need to introduce new concepts: a cut path is\na path which is transverse to strings of a web, and the weight of a cut path is the sum of\nweights of all decorated strings which intersect with the cut path. For example, the weight\nof the clasp as depicted in Figure 7 is 2V\u03bb1 abbreviated by (2, 0). Then we can generalize\nthe annihilation axiom as follows: if we attach the clasp to a web which has a cut path of\na weight less than that of the clasp, then it is zero. Since the weight of the clasp shown in\nFigure 7 is (2, 1) and there is a cut path of weight (2, 0), the web in Figure 7 is zero by the\nannihilation axiom. For sl(3), the clasp \u03c9 of weight (a, b) is defined to be the web in the\nweb space of V\u03bb\u2297a\n\u2297 V\u03bb\u2297b\n\u2297 (V\u03bb\u22171 )\u2297a \u2297 (V\u03bb\u22172 )\u2297b , say W , which satisfies the annihilation axiom\n1\n2\nand the idempotent axiom (\u03c9 2 = \u03c9). One can see the dimension of the web space of W is\none, i.e., all webs in the web space of W are multiples of \u03c9. However, the clasp of weight\n(a, b) is unique by the idempotent axiom (it is nonzero). An algebraic proof of the existence\nof clasps for sl(3) and sp(4) is given [21]. On the other hand, the double clasps expansion\nand the quadruple clasps expansion formulae [28] do concretely show the existence of the\nsl(3) clasp. Using these expansions one can find Example 2.4 (we omit some of arrows on\nthe edges of webs, but it should be clear).\nExample 2.4.

Single Clasp Expansions for the quantum sl(3) clasps\nFirst we look at a single clasp expansion of the clasp of weight (n, 0) where the weight\n(a, b) stands for a\u03bb1 + b\u03bb2 in section 3.1. We can easily find a single clasp expansion of\nthe clasp of weight (0, n) by reversing arrows in the equation presented in the formula of\nProposition 3.1. In section 3.2, we find a single clasp expansion of the clasp of weight\n(a, b) and double clasps expansions. Kuperberg showed that for a fixed boundary, all webs\nof the given boundary are cut outs from the hexagonal tiling of the plane with the given\nboundary [21].\n3.1. Single clasp expansions of a clasp of weight (n,0). First we find a single clasp\nexpansions of a clasp of weight (n,0) in Proposition 3.1. It is worth to mention that i) this\nexpansion can be obtained from a complete expansion (linear expansions of webs without\nany clasps) which can be found by using a double clasps expansion iteratively [28] and then\nattaching a clasp of weight (n \u2212 1, 0) to each web in the expansion; ii) the single clasp\nexpansion in Proposition 3.1 holds for any sl(n) where n \u2265 4 because sl(3) is naturally embedded in sl(n). By symmetries, there are four different single clasp expansions depending\non where the clasp of weight (n \u2212 1, 0) is located. For equation 4, the clasp is located at\nthe southwest corner, which will be considered the standard expansion, otherwise, we will\nstate the location of the clasp.\nWe demonstrate Proposition 3.1 for n = 2, 3 directly using the presentations of the clasps\nin Example 2.4. For n = 2, Proposition 3.1 is identical to the first formula of Example 2.4.\nFor n = 3, by attaching the clasp of weight (2, 0) to the southwest corner of each web in\nthe second formula of Example 2.4,\n\n=\n\nSince\n\n\uf8eb\n\n[2] \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n+\n\uf8ec\n[3] \uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f7 [1] \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7+\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f8 [3] \uf8ed\n\n+\n\n+\n\n= 0, we find\n\n=\n\n+\n\n[2]\n[3]\n\nThis verifies the n = 3 case of Proposition 3.1.\n\n+\n\n[1]\n[3]\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7+\n\uf8f8 [2][3]\n\n\fJONES-WENZL IDEMPOTENTS\n\n9\n\nProposition 3.1.

We prove the linear independence of the webs in the right-hand side of the equation 4.\nSuppose there exists a linear combination of webs which is zero, let us denote ci be the\ncoefficient of this linear combination corresponding to the i-th web in the right-hand side\nof the equation 4.\n\"j\"\n...\n\n0 = c1\n\n+\n\nn\nX\n\n\"1\"\n\n...\n\n...\n\ncj\n\nj=2\n\nn\u22121\n\nn\u22121\n\nIf we attach the clasp of weight (n, 0) to the top of each web in the right-hand side of\nequation 4, the first web corresponding to the coefficient c1 is nonzero because it is a cut\nout from the hexagonal tiling of the plane. All other remaining webs corresponding to ck\nwhere k \u2265 2 are zero because\n= 0. Therefore, c1 = 0.\n\"i\"\n...\n\n\"j\"\n\n\"1\"\n...\n+\n\n0 = ci\n\nn\nX\n\n...\n\n\"1\"\n...\n\ncj\n\nj=i+1\n\nn\u22121\n\nn\u22121\n\nInductively we assume all ck = 0 where k < i. If we attach the clasp of weight (n \u2212 i + 1)\nto the left top of each web in the right side of equation 4, the i-th web corresponding to\nthe coefficient ci is nonzero because it is a cut out from the hexagonal tiling of the plane.\nAll other remaining webs corresponding to ck where k \u2265 i + 1 are zero because the same\nreason. Therefore, ci = 0. This completes the proof of linear independency.\nNow, we can show that the set of the webs in the right-hand side in equation 4 is a basis\nby counting the dimension of web spaces. If we set a = (n + 1), b = 1, we find the dimension\nof the web space of V\u03bb\u2297n+1\n\u2297 V\u03bb2 \u2297 V(n\u22121)\u03bb2 is n by Lemma 2.1. Therefore, these webs in\n1\nright side of equation 4 form a basis for the single clasp expansion.\n\n\f10\n\nDONGSEOK KIM\n\nWe put\n\n...\n\n= a1\n\n...\n\n+\n\nn\nX\n\n\"i\"\n...\nai\n\n\"1\"\n...\n,\n\ni=2\n\nn\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\nwith some ai , since the webs in the right hand side span the web space which contains the\nweb of the left hand side. If we attach a on the top of webs in equation 4, the left side of\nequation 4 becomes zero and all webs in the right-hand side of equation 4 become multiples\nof a web. Thus we get the following n \u2212 1 equations.\nan\u22121 \u2212 [2]an = 0.\nFor i = 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 2,\nai \u2212 [2]ai+1 + ai+2 = 0.\nFrom these equations, we are able to find the relations between the coefficients ai 's. By a\nnormalization, attaching the clasp of weight (n, 0) to the top of each web in the equation,\nwe find a1 = 1. Then other coefficients can be found subsequently.\n\u0003\n3.2. Single clasp expansions of a non-segregated clasp of weight (a, b). The most\ninteresting case is a single clasp expansion of the clasp of weight (a, b) where a 6= 0 6= b.\nBy Lemma 2.1, we know the number of webs in a single clasp expansion of the clasp of\nweight (a, b) is (a + 1)b. We need a set of basis webs with a nice rectangular order, but we\ncan not find one in the general case. Even if one finds such a basis, each web in the basis\nwould have many hexagonal faces which make it very difficult to get numerical relations.\nSo we start from an alternative, non-segregated clasp. A non-segregated clasp is obtained\nfrom the segregated clasp by attaching a sequence of H's until we get the desired shape of\nedge orientations. Fortunately, there is a canonical way to find them by putting H's from\nthe leftmost string of weight \u03bb2 or \u2212 until it reach to the desired position. The left side\nof the equation in Figure 8 is an example of a non-segregated clasp of weight (2, 3). the\nright-hand side of the equation in Figure 8 shows a sequence of H's which illustrates how\nwe obtain it from the segregated clasp of weight (2, 3).\nFirst of all, we can show that the non-segregated clasps are well-defined [15, Lemma 2.6].\nOne can prove that non-segregated clasps also satisfy two properties of segregated clasps:\n1) two consecutive non-segregated clasps is equal to a non-segregated clasp, 2) if we attach\na web to a non-segregated clasp and if it has a cut path whose weight is less than the\nweight of the clasp, then it is zero [15, Lemma 2.7]. We find a single clasp expansion of a\nnon-segregated clasp of weight (a, b) in shown in equation 5. Kuperberg showed that for\na fixed boundary, the interior can be filled by a cut out from the hexagonal tiling of the\nplane with the given boundary [21]. For our cases, there are two possible fillings but we use\nthe maximal cut out of the hexagonal tiling. We draw examples of the case i = 6, j = 5\nand the first one in Figure 9 is not a maximal cut out and the second one is the maximal\ncut out which fits to the left rectangle and the last one is the maximal cut out which fits\n\n\fJONES-WENZL IDEMPOTENTS\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n11\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n=\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n+\n\nFigure 8.

First of all, all these webs in the equation 5 are nonzero because they are cut outs\nfrom the hexagonal tiling of the plane. These webs in the right hand side of the equation\nform a basis because their cardinality is the same as the dimension of the invariant space\nof Va\u03bb1 +(b\u22121)\u03bb2 \u2297 V\u03bb\u2297a+1\n\u2297 V\u03bb\u2297b\u22121\nand they are linearly independent. Suppose that a linear\n1\n2\ncombination of webs in the right-hand side of the equation 5 is zero for some choice of ai,j .\nBy attaching the clasp of weight (0, b \u2212 i + 1) to the left top and (a + 1 \u2212 j, 0) on right\ntop of webs one can see all webs but the webs Ds,t , 1 \u2264 s \u2264 i, 0 \u2264 t \u2264 j vanish. It is clear\nthat a1,0 = 0 by attaching the clasp of weight (0, b) and (0, a + 1). Inductively, we can show\nai,j = 0 for all i, j.\nProof.

Usually we normalize one basis web\nin the expansion to get a known value. But we can not normalize for this expansion yet\nbecause it is not a segregated clasp. Thus we use a complicate procedure in Lemma 6.2 to\n[b + 1]\nfind that the coefficient of a1,a is 1. Then, we find that a1,0 is\nand it completes\n[a + b + 1]\nthe proof of the theorem.\n\u0003\nWe find a double clasps expansion as shown in Theorem 3.3, the box between two clasps\nis filled by the unique maximal cut out from the hexagonal tiling with the given boundary\nas we have seen in Figure 9.\nTheorem 3.3.

Single Clasp Expansion for the quantum sp(4)\n\nThe quantum sp(4) webs are generated by a single web in Figure 11 and a complete set\nof relations is given in Figure 12 [21]. Again, an algebraic proof of the existence of the\nclasp of the weight (a, b) using the annihilation axiom and the idempotent axiom is given\nin [21]. On the other hand, one can use the double clasps expansions in Corollary 4.3 and\nCorollary 4.5 to define the clasps of the weight (n, 0) and (0, n). Unfortunately, we do not\nhave any expansion formula for the clasp of the weight (a, b) where a 6= 0 6= b. Using these\nexpansions one can find Example 4.1. We can define tetravalent vertices to achieve the same\nend as in Figure 13. We will use the these shapes to find a single clasp expansion otherwise\nthere is an ambiguity of a preferred direction by the last relation presented in Figure 12.\nFirst we will find single clasp expansions of clasps of weight (n, 0) and (0, n) and then use\nthem to find coefficients of double clasps expansions of clasps of weight (n, 0) and (0, n). But\nwe are unable to find a single clasp expansion of the clasp of weight (a, b) where a 6= 0 6= b.\nRemark that the cut weight is defined slightly different way. A cut path may cut diagonally\nthrough a tetravalent vertex, and its weight is defined as n\u03bb1 + (k + k \u2032 )\u03bb2 , where n is the\nnumber of type \"1\", single strands, that it cuts, k is the number of type \"2\", double strands,\nthat it cuts, and k \u2032 is the number of tetravalent vertices that it bisects.\n\n\fJONES-WENZL IDEMPOTENTS\n\n15\n\nFigure 11.

By combining with the weight diagram of V\u03bb\u2297n\nand minimal cut paths, we can find\n1\na set of nonzero webs for single clasp expansion of a clasp of weight (n, 0) as in equation 6.\nLet us denote the web corresponding to the i-th in the first summation and j-th in the\nsecond summation by Di,j and its coefficient by aij . First we will show that these webs\nare linearly independent. Suppose that a linear combination of the right-hand side of the\nequation in Figure 5 is zero for some choice of aij . It is clear that ai,i+1 = 0 by attaching\nthe clasp of weight (n \u2212 i, 0) to left top of webs and the clasp of weight (i, 0) to the right\ntop of each webs. By attaching the clasp of weight (n \u2212 j + 1, 0) to left top of webs and\nthe clasp of weight (i, 0) to the right top of webs, inductively we can show aij = 0 for all\nj \u2265 i + 1.

Thus, these webs in right hand side of the equation form a basis.\nNow we are set to finds ai,j . For equations, we remark that the relations of webs shown\nin Figure 14 can be easily obtained from the relations depicted in Figure 12. Using these\nrelations, we get the following n \u2212 1 equations by attaching a . By attaching a , we have\n(n \u2212 1)2 equations.

Applications of the quantum sl(3) representation theory\nIn the section we will discuss some applications of the quantum sl(3) representation\ntheory.\n5.1. Polynomial invariants of links. The HOMFLY polynomial P3 (q) can be obtained\nby coloring all components by the vector representations of the quantum sl(3) and the\nfollowing skein relations\nP3 (\u2205) = 1,\n\u222a D) = [3]P3 (D),\n\nP3 (\n3\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\nq P3 (L+ ) \u2212 q \u2212 2 P3 (L\u2212 ) = (q 2 \u2212 q \u2212 2 )P3 (L0 ),\nwhere \u2205 is the empty diagram, is the trivial knot and L+ , L\u2212 and L0 are three diagrams\nwhich are identical except at one crossing as illustrated in Figure 16. On the other hand,\nthe polynomial P3 (q) can be computed by linearly expanding each crossing into a sum of\nwebs as shown in Figure 17 then by applying relations in Figure 5 [1, 20, 27]. A benefit\nof using webs is that we can easily define the colored sl(3) HOMFLY polynomial G3 (L, \u03bc)\nof L as follows. Let L be a colored link of l components say, L1 , L2 , . . . , Ll , where each\ncomponent Li is colored by an irreducible representation Vai \u03bb1 +bi \u03bb2 of the quantum sl(3)\nand \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 are the fundamental weights of sl(3). The coloring is denoted by \u03bc = (a1 \u03bb1 +\nb1 \u03bb2 , a2 \u03bb1 + b2 \u03bb2 , . . . , al \u03bb1 + bl \u03bb2 ). First we replace each component Li by ai + bi copies of\nparallel lines and each of ai lines is colored by the weight \u03bb1 and each of bi lines is colored\nby the weight \u03bb2 . Then we put a clasp of the weight (ai \u03bb1 + bi \u03bb2 ) for Li . If we assume the\nclasps are far away from crossings, we expand each crossing as depicted in Figure 17, then\nexpand each clasp inductively by Theorem 3.3. The value we find after removing all faces\nby using the relations in Figure 5 is the colored sl(3) HOMFLY polynomial G3 (L, \u03bc) of L.\n\n\f20\n\nDONGSEOK KIM\n\n,\n\n,\n\nL+\n\nL\u2212\n\nL0\n\nFigure 16.

Expansion of crossings for P3 (q).\nOne can find the following theorem which is a generalization of a criterion to determine the\nperiodicity of a link [1, 3].\nTheorem 5.1. Let p be a positive integer and L be a p-periodic link in S 3 with the factor\nlink L. Let \u03bc be a p-periodic coloring of L and \u03bc be the induced coloring of L. Then\nG3 (L, \u03bc) \u2261 G3 (L, \u03bc)p\n\nmodulo I3 ,\n1\n\nwhere L is the factor link and I3 is the ideal of Z[q \u00b1 2 ] generated by p and [3]p \u2212 [3].\nProof. Since the clasps are idempotents, for each component, we put p \u2212 1 extra clasps\nfor each copies of components by the rotation of order p. First we keep the clasps far\naway from the crossings. The key idea of the proof given in [1] is that if any expansion of\ncrossings occurs in the link diagram, it must be used identically for all other p \u2212 1 copies\nof the diagram. Otherwise there will be p identical shapes by the rotation of order p, then\nit is congruent to zero modulo p. By the same philosophy, if any application of relations\noccurs, it must be used identically for all other p \u2212 1 copies. Otherwise it is congruent to\nzero modulo p. Once there is an unknot in the fundamental domain of the action of order\np, there are p identical unknots by the rotation which occurs only once in the factor link.\nTherefore, we get the congruence [3]p \u2212 [3].\n\u0003\n5.2. 3j and 6j symbols for the quantum sl(3) representation theory. 3j symbols and\n6j symbols for the quantum sl(2) representation theory have many significant implications in\nMathematics and Physics. 3j symbols are given in the equation shown in Figure 18 [25]. Its\nnatural generalization for the quantum sl(3) representation theory was first suggested [21]\nand studied [16]. Let \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 be the fundamental dominant weights of sl(3, C). Let Va\u03bb1 +b\u03bb2\nbe an irreducible representation of sl(3, C) of highest weight a\u03bb1 + b\u03bb2 .

Let d = min {a1 , a2 , a3 , b1 , b2 , b3 }. If\ndim(Inv(Va1 \u03bb1 +b1 \u03bb2 \u2297 Va2 \u03bb1 +b2 \u03bb2 \u2297 Va3 \u03bb1 +b3 \u03bb2 )) is nonzero, in fact d + 1, then we say a triple\nof ordered pairs ((a1 , b1 ), (a2 , b2 ), (a3 , b3 )) is admissible. One can show ((a1 , b1 ), (a2 , b2 ),\n(a3 , b3 )) is admissible if and only if there exist nonnegative integers k, l, m, n, o, p, q such\nthat a2 = d + l + p, a3 = d + n + q, b1 = d + k + p, b2 = d + m + q, b3 = d + o and\nk \u2212 n = o \u2212 l = m. For an admissible triple, we can write its trihedron coefficients as a\n(d + 1) \u00d7 (d + 1) matrix. Let us denote it by M\u0398 (a1 , b1 , a2 , b2 , a3 , b3 ) or M\u0398 (\u03bb) where \u03bb =\na1 \u03bb1 +b1 \u03bb2 +a2 \u03bb1 +b2 \u03bb2 +a3 \u03bb1 +b3 \u03bb2 . Also we denotes its (i, j) entry by \u0398(a1 , b1 , a2 , b2 ,\na3 , b3 ; i, j) or \u0398(\u03bb; i, j) where 0 \u2264 i, j \u2264 d. The trihedron shape of \u0398(a1 , b1 , a2 , b2 , a3 ,\nb3 ; i, j) is given in Figure 19 where the triangles are filled by cut outs from the hexagonal\ntiling of the plane [21].

Prime web 61 .\nl) and M\u0398 (i, j + k, k + l, m, j + m, j + l ; 0, 0) were found in [16]. All other cases of 3j\nsymbols and 6j symbols are left open.\n5.3. sl(3) invariants of cubic planar bipartite graphs. The sl(3) webs are directed\ncubic bipartite planar graphs together circles (no vertices) where the direction of the edges\nis from one set to the other set in the bipartition. From a given directed cubic bipartite\nplanar graph, we remove all circles by the relation 1 and then remove the multiple edges by\nthe relation 2 in Figure 5. Using a simple application of the Euler characteristic number of\na graphs in the unit disc, we can show the existence of a rectangular face [28]. By inducting\non the number of faces, we provides the existence of the quantum sl(3) invariants of directed\ncubic bipartite planar graphs. It is fairly easy to prove the quantum sl(3) invariant does\nnot depend on the choice of directions in the bipartition. Thus, the quantum sl(3) invariant\nnaturally extends to any cubic bipartite planar graph G, let us denote it by PG (q). By using\na favor of graph theory, we find a classification theorem and provide a method to find all\n3-connected cubic bipartite planar graphs which is called prime webs [18]. As little as it is\nknown about the properties of the quantum invariants of links, we know a very little how\nPG (q) tells us about the properties of graphs.\nFor symmetries of cubic bipartite planar graph, the idea of the Theorem 5.1 and 5.3 works\nfor the sl(3) graph invariants with one exception. There is a critical difference between these\ntwo invariants which is illustrated in Theorem 5.2.\nTheorem 5.2 ( [18]). Let G be a planar cubic bipartite graph with the group of symmetries\n\u0393 of order n. Let \u0393d be a subgroup of \u0393 of order d such that the fundamental domain of\nG/\u0393d is not a basis web with the given boundary. Then\nPG (q) \u2261 (PG/\u0393d (q))d\n\nmodulo Id ,\n\n1\n\nwhere Id is the ideal of Z[q \u00b1 2 ] generated by d and [3]d \u2212 [3].\nIf the fundamental domain of G/\u0393 is a basis web with the given boundary, then the main\nidea of the theorem no longer works and a counterexample was found as follows [18]. We\nlook at an example 61 as shown in Figure 20. By a help of a machine, we can see that there\n1\ndoes not exist an \u03b1 \u2208 Z[q \u00b1 2 ] such that\n(\u03b1)6 \u2261 [2]4 [3] + 2[2]2 [3] mod I6\neven though there do exist a symmetry of order 6 for 61 .\n\n\fJONES-WENZL IDEMPOTENTS\n\n23\n\n5.4. Applications for the quantum sp(4) representation theory. A quantum sp(4)\npolynomial invariant Gsp(4) (L, \u03bc) can be defined [20, 21] where \u03bc is a fundamental representation of the quantum sp(4). Since we have found single clasp expansion of the clasps of\nweight (a, 0) and (0, b), we can extend Gsp(4) (L, \u03bc) for \u03bc is an irreducible representations of\nweight either (a, 0) and (0, b). If we assume a coloring \u03bc = (a, 0) or \u03bc = (0, b), by the same\nidea of the proof of Theorem 5.1, we can find the following theorem from Corollary 4.3 and\n4.5.\nTheorem 5.3. Let p be a positive integer and L be a p\u2212periodic link in S 3 with the factor\nlink L. Let \u03bc be a p-periodic coloring of L and \u03bc be the induced coloring of L. Then\nGsp(4) (L, \u03bc) \u2261 Gsp(4) (L, \u03bc)p\n\nmodulo Isp(4) ,\n\n)p +\nwhere L is the factor link and Isp(4) is the ideal of Z[q \u00b1 2 ] generated by p, (\u2212 [6][2]\n[3]\n1\n\n[6][5] p\nand ( [3][2]\n) \u2212\n\n[6][2]\n[3]\n\n[6][5]\n.\n[3][2]\n\nIn fact, Theorem 5.3 remains true even if \u03bc is any finite dimensional irreducible representation of sp(4), but we would not be able to obtain the actual polynomials because any\nexpansion is not known for the clasp of the weight (a, b) where a 6= 0 6= b.\n6. The Proof of Lemmas\nLet us recalled that the relation 3 in Figure 5 is called a rectangular relation and the\nfirst(second) web in the right-hand side of the equality is called a horizontal(vertical, respectively) splitting. The web in the equation shown in Figure 5 corresponding to the\ncoefficient ai,j is denoted by Di,j . After attaching H's to Di,j as illustrated in Figure 21,\nthe resulting web is denoted by D\u0303i,j . We find that D\u0303i,j contains some elliptic faces. If we\ndecompose each D\u0303i,j into a linear combination of webs which have no elliptic faces, then\nthe union of all these webs forms a basis. Let us prove that these webs actually form a\nbasis which will be denoted by Di\u2032\u2032 ,j \u2032 . As vector spaces, this change, adding H's as in Figure\n21, induces an isomorphism between two web spaces because its matrix representation with\nrespect to these web bases {Di,j } and {Di\u2032\u2032 ,j \u2032 } is an (a + 1)b \u00d7 (a + 1)b matrix whose determinant is \u00b1[2]ab because a single H contributes \u00b1[2] depends on the choice of the direction\nof H.\nTo find a single clasp expansion of the segregated clasp of weight (a, b), we have to find\nall linear expansions of D\u0303i,j into a new web basis Di\u2032\u2032 ,j \u2032 . In general this is very complicate.\nInstead of using relations for linear expansions, we look for an alternative. From D\u0303i,j we\nsee that there are a + b + 1 nodes on top and a + b \u2212 1 nodes right above the clasp. A\nY shape in the web Di,j forces D\u0303i,j to have at least one rectangular face. Each splitting\ncreates another rectangular face until it becomes a basis web (possibly using the relation 2\nin Figure 5 once). If we repeatedly use the rectangular relations as in equation 3 in Figure\n5, we can push up Y 's so that there are either two Y 's or one U shape at the top. A stem\nof a web is a + b \u2212 1 disjoint union of vertical lines which connect top a + b \u2212 1 nodes out\nof a + b + 1 nodes to the clasp of weight (a, b \u2212 1) together a U-turn or two Y 's on top. It\nis clear that these connecting lines should be mutually disjoint, otherwise, we will have a\ncut path with weight less than (a, b \u2212 1), i.e., the web is zero. Unfortunately some of stems\n\n\f24\n\nDONGSEOK KIM\n\nb\n\na\n\n***\n\n***\nDij\n\nFigure 21.

Three webs which do not vanish after attaching the clasp of\nweight (a, b\u22121) to the top left side of webs D\u0303i,j from the equation in Figure 21.\ndo not arise naturally in the linear expansion of D\u0303i,j because it may not be obtained by\nremoving elliptic faces. If a stem appears, we call it an admissible stem. For single clasp\nexpansions, finding all these admissible stems will be more difficult than linear expansions\nby relations. But for double clasp expansions of segregated clasps of weight (a, b) there are\nonly few possible admissible stems whose coefficients are nonzero.\nLemma 6.1. After attaching the clasp of weight (a, b \u2212 1) to the top left side of webs D\u0303i,j\nfrom the equation in Figure 21, the only non-vanishing webs are those three webs as depicted\nin Figure 22.\nProof. It is possible to have two adjacent Y 's which appear in the second and third webs in\nFigure 22 but a U-turn can appear in only two places because of the orientation of edges.\nIf we attach the clasp of weight (a, b \u2212 1) to the northwest corner of the resulting web and\nif there is a U or a Y shape just below the clasp of weight (a, b \u2212 1), the web becomes zero.\nTherefore only these three webs do not vanish.\n\u0003\n\n\fJONES-WENZL IDEMPOTENTS\n\n25\n\nFigure 23. Di,a where i > 1.\nIn the following lemma, we find all D\u0303i,j 's which can be transformed to each of the web\nin Figure 22.\nLemma 6.2. Only D\u03031,a (D\u03032,a ) can be transformed to the first(second, respectively) web in\nFigure 22. Only the three webs, D\u03031,a\u22121 , D\u03031,a and D\u03032,a\u22121 can be transformed to the last web.\nMoreover, all of these transformations use only rectangular relations as in equation 3 except\nthe transformation from D\u03031,a\u22121 to the third web uses the relation 2 in Figure 5 exactly once.\nProof. For the first web shown in Figure 22, it is fairly easy to see that we need to look at\nD\u0303i,a , for i = 1, 2, . . . , b, otherwise the last two strings can not be changed to the first web\npresented in Figure 22 with a U-turn. Now we look at the Di,a where i > 1 as illustrated\nin Figure 23. Since we picked where the U turn appears already, only possible disjoint lines\nare given as thick and lightly shaded lines but we can not finish to have a stem because the\ndarkly shaded string from the left top can not be connected to the bottom clasp without\nbeing zero, i.e., if we connect the tick line to clasp, there will be either or a right above\nof the clasp of weight (a, b \u2212 1).\nSo only nonzero admissible stems should be obtained from D\u03031,a . As we explained before,\none can see that there is a rectangular face in the web D\u03031,a . Since the horizontal splitting\nmakes it zero, we have to split vertically. For the resulting web, this process created one\nrectangular face at right topside of previous place. We have to split vertically and the\nprocess are repeated until the last step, both splits do not vanish. The web in the last step\nis drawn in Figure 24 with the rectangular face, darkly shaded. The vertical split gives us\nthe first web in Figure 22 and the horizontal split gives the third web in Figure 22.\nA similar argument works for the second web illustrated in Figure 22. The third web\ndepicted in Figure 22 is a little subtle. First one can see that none of D\u0303i,j can be transformed\nif either i > 2 or j < a \u2212 1. Thus, we only need to check D\u03031,a\u22121 , D\u03031,a , D\u03032,a\u22121 and D\u03032,a but\nwe already know about D\u03031,a , D\u03032,a . Figure 25 shows the nonzero admissible stem for D\u03031,a\u22121 .\nAs usual, we draw a stem as a union of thick and darkly shaded lines. Note that we have\n\n\f26\n\nDONGSEOK KIM\n\nFigure 24.

The Figure 26 shows the\nnonzero admissible stem for D\u03032,a\u22121 . This completes the proof of the lemma.\n\u0003\nReferences\n1. N.
