INTRODUCTION\n\nThere is a general consensus that cosmic rays with\nenergy above 1019 eV originate from extragalactic\nastrophysical sources, although the sources are unidentified. Some candidates have been proposed, including\nactive galactic nucleus (AGN) jets (e.g. Biermann &\nStrittmatter 1987; Berezinsky et al. 2006), gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) (Waxman 1995; Vietri 1995; Wick et\nal. 2004; Murase et al. 2008), and semi-relativistic\nhypernovae remnants (Wang et al. 2007). Any viable\ncandidates must be able to provide a right amount of\nUHECR emissivity to match the observed flux. Due\nto the attenuation by cosmic microwave and infrared\nbackground radiation through photohadronic processes,\nthe energy loss distance of UHECRs above 1019 eV is\nless than several hundreds of Mpc. Although extragalactic cosmic ray protons in the lower energy range\n1018 . E . 1019 eV suffer from much less energy\nloss, they could possibly travel a linear distance much\nsmaller than the size of the universe as well due to\nthe diffusion in the intergalactic magnetic fields (e.g.\nLemoine 2005). For UHECRs whose Larmor radius rL\nis much larger than the coherence scale (lc ) of the fields,\n1 Department of Astronomy, Nanjing University, Nanjing,\n210093, China\n2 Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kernphysik, Saupfercheckweg 1,\n69117 Heidelberg, Germany\n3 Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 31 Fitzwilliam Place,\nDublin 2, Ireland\n4 Key laboratory of Modern Astronomy and Astrophysics\n(Nanjing University), Ministry of Education, Nanjing 210093,\nChina\n\nwhich is valid when E \u226b 1018 eV(B/1nG)(lc /1Mpc),\n2\nthe scattering length is lscatt \u2243 rL\n/lc and thus\n5\nthe diffusion coefficient is D(E) = (1/3)clscatt =\n4 \u00d7 1034 (E/1018 eV)2 (B/1nG)\u22122 (lc /1Mpc)cm2 s\u22121 .\nIn\na\nHubble\ntime,\nthese\nparticles travel\na linear distance d\n\u223c\n(2H0\u22121 D)1/2\n\u2243\n60(E/1018eV)(B/1nG)\u22121 (lc /1Mpc)\u22121/2 Mpc,\nwhere\nH0 is the Hubble constant at present. Therefore, the\nobserved UHECR intensity reflects only the emissivity\nin the nearby universe within several hundreds of Mpc.\nUsually, in the literature this emissivity is compared\nwith the emissivity in electromagnetic radiation produced by local candidate sources to check whether\nthey can provide sufficient power. The same type\nof candidate sources are also present in the distant\nuniverse and produce electromagnetic radiation and\nUHECRs as well. It would be also useful to compare the\nemissivity of UHECRs and emissivity in electromagnetic\nradiation in the distant universe, especially when the\nlocal sources of the candidates, such as GRBs or AGN\ngiant flares (Farrar & Gruzinov 2009), are too infrequent\nto be detectable in years. While the emissivity in the\nelectromagnetic radiation can be measured directly for\ndistant sources, UHECRs produced by them can not\nbe observable and therefore their emissivity can not\nbe determined directly. However, UHECRs produce\n5\n\nFor extragalactic cosmic ray protons with E\n.\n1018 eV(B/1nG)\u22121 (lc /1Mpc), the smaller angle diffusion approximation will not be valid and the diffusion coefficient in this\nregime will be different.\n\n\f2\nUHE electrons and gamma-rays that in turn initiate\nelectromagnetic cascades on extragalactic background\nlight (EBL) and this lower-energy, secondary cascade\nradiation can be observable. Thus the energy of UHECRs will be eventually converted to observable diffuse\ngamma-rays, as was first noticed by Wdowczyk et al.\n(1972). The spectrum of this cascade radiation is rather\ninsensitive to the spectrum of the original UHECRs\n(e.g. Strong et al. 1973; Berezinsky & Smirnov 1975;\nCoppi & Aharonian 1997), and thus the total level\nof the cascade background acts as a particle detector\ncalorimeter, allowing us to measure the total UHECR\nemissivity in the universe.\nRecently, Kalashev et al. (2009) studied the contribution of the cascade radiation by UHECRs interacting\nwith EBL photons to the diffuse extragalactic gammaray background (EGBR) measured by EGRET. Using\nthe new measurement of the EGBR by Fermi/LAT,\nBerezinsky et al. (2011) and Ahlers et al. (2010) attempted to constrain the UHECR source evolution models and made predictions for the flux level of cosmogenic\nneutrinos. All these papers assume that the accumulated\nUHECR flux from a homogenous population of sources\nin the whole universe fit the observed energy spectrum of\nUHECRs. In our paper, in order to obtain an independent constraint on the emissivity of UHECRs in the distant universe, we will relax this assumption since UHECRs above 1019 eV are produced dominantly by local\nsources within hundreds of Mpc, much smaller than the\nsize of the universe, whose density could well be enhanced\nor deficient relative to the average density. Indeed, there\nare suggestions that one single source in the nearby universe, such as Cen A, is the dominated source producing\nthe observed UHECRs (e.g. Cavallo 1978; Farrar & Piran 2000; Rieger & Aharonian 2009).\nIn \u00a72, we first present the constraints on the cascade\nemission imposed by the Fermi/LAT observations of the\nEGBR. Then in \u00a73.1, we present an analytic approach\nfor calculating the energy density of the cascade emission produced by UHECRs in the universe. By comparison with the allowed maximum energy density of the\ncascade radiation measured by Fermi/LAT, we obtain\nupper limits on the UHECR emissivity at high redshifts\nin \u00a73.3. We then discuss the effect of synchrotron loss of\nsecondary electrons in the presence of intergalactic magnetic fields on the cascade radiation in \u00a73.4. Upper limits\non the cosmogenic neutrino flux are further obtained in\n\u00a73.5. We discuss the case of heavy nuclei composition of\nUHECRs in \u00a74. Finally, we give a summary in \u00a75.\n2. CASCADE RADIATION\n\nUHECRs interact with EBL photons through photopion process or Bethe-Heitler process and produce UHE\nelectrons and gamma-rays. These UHE electrons and\ngamma-rays interact via Compton and pair-production\nprocess with soft photons in the CMB and radio background. This will lead to the development of an electromagnetic cascade, in which the number of electrons and\nphotons increase quickly. The cascade proceeds until the\nenergy of photons drops below the pair creation threshold. This process reprocesses essentially all the energy\nof UHE electrons and gamma-rays produced by UHECRs into lower-energy photons below \u223c TeV which we\ncan detect. The cascade low-energy photon spectrum is\n\na universal spectrum, described by\n\u001a \u22121.5\ndn\n\u01eb\u03b3\nfor \u01eb\u03b3 < \u01ebb\n\u221d\n\u2212\u03b1\nd\u01eb\u03b3\n\u01eb\u03b3 \u03b3 for \u01ebb < \u01eb\u03b3 < \u01ebcut\n\n(1)\n\nwith a steepening at \u01eb\u03b3 > \u01ebcut , where \u01ebcut is the absorption energy of a cascade photon scattering on EBL,\n\u01ebb = (\u01ebcut /1TeV)2 GeV, and \u03b1\u03b3 \u2243 1.8 \u2212 2 typically (e.g.\nBerezinsky & Smirnov 1975; Coppi & Aharonian 1997).\nThe peak of the energy distribution in this spectrum is\nat \u01ebcut , which is estimated to be \u223c 100GeV (Berezinsky\net al. 2011). By requiring that this theoretical cascade\nspectrum touches the lower end of the error bars of the\nFermi/LAT data (Abdo et al. 2010), Berezinsky et al.\n(2011) obtained an upper limit on the cascade energy\ndensity, i.e.\nmax\n\u03c9\u03b3 . \u03c9cas\n= 5.8 \u00d7 10\u22127 eVcm\u22123 .\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c9\u03b3 is the cascade energy density produced by any\nUHECR source population in the universe.\n3. CONSTRAINING THE UHECR EMISSIVITY WITH THE\nDIFFUSE GAMMA-RAY EMISSION\n\n3.1. Energy loss of UHECRs into the electro-magnetic\n\ncomponent\nSince the cascade emission is mainly in the GeV-TeV\nrange and has an almost universal spectrum, it is numerically much more efficient to calculate the total energy density \u03c9\u03b3 injected into the cascade and compare\nmax\nthis value with the limit \u03c9cas\nimposed by Fermi/LAT.\nThe cascade energy density is the accumulation of the\nelectro-magnetic (EM) radiation produced by the source\npopulation over the whole universe.

We take three cases for S(z) in the following\ncalculation, i.e. S(z) follows the star formation history\n(SFR), gamma-ray burst (GRB) rate and active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) rate in the universe respectively.\nWe take the form of SFR from Y\u00fcskel et al.

Following Yuksel & Kistler (2007), we assume\nSGRB (z) \u221d (1 + z)1.4 SSFH , which gives\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (1 + z)4.8 , z < 1\nSGRB (z) \u221d (1 + z)1.1 , 1 < z < 4\n(12)\n\uf8f3 (1 + z)\u22122.1 . z > 4\nAs shown by Yuksel & Kistler (2007), this source density evolution function is consistent with the evolution\nfunction obtained in Le & Dermer (2007).\nAGNs may have a similarly strong evolution with redshift, as found in Hasinger et al. (2005) for different\nluminosity AGNs. Following Hasinger et al. (2005) and\nAhlers et al. (2009), we take the form of\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (1 + z)5.0 , z < 1.7\nSAGN (z) \u221d constant, 1.7 < z < 2.7\n(13)\n\uf8f3 10(2.7\u2212z) . z > 2.7\n3.3. Constraints on the emissivity of UHECRs in the\n\ndistant universe\nOnce we know \u03b20,em and the source density evolution\nfunction S(z), we can calculate the cascade energy density \u03c9\u03b3 , i.e.\nZ zmax Z Ep,max\nS(z) dt\ndE s dz,\n\u03b20,em (Eps , z)Lp (z = 1)\n\u03c9\u03b3 =\nS(z\n= 1) dz p\nEp,min\n0\n(14)\nwhere Ep,min and Ep,max are the minimum and maximum\nenergy of extragalactic cosmic rays, zmax is the maximum\nredshift of extragalactic cosmic ray sources, and dz/dt =\nH0 (1 + z)[\u03a9M (1 + z)3 + \u03a9\u039b ]1/2 (with \u03a9 = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7,\nand H0 = 70kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ). We assume a power-law\nspectrum for extragalactic cosmic rays between Ep,min\nand Ep,max , i.e. dNp /dEps \u221d (Eps )\u2212\u03b3g . As \u03b2em becomes\nnegligible at Ep < 1017 eV, Ep,min is taken to be 1017 eV\nin the following calculations, unless otherwise specified.\nmax\nRequiring \u03c9\u03b3 . \u03c9cas\n, one can obtain the upper limit\non the UHECR emissivity at z = 1 for different source\ndensity evolution scenarios. We define the total UHECR\nemissivity as the integral of Lp (z = 1) over the energy\nrange from Ep,min to Ep,max , i.e.\nZ Ep,max\n(15)\nLp (z = 1)dEps .\nP (z = 1) \u2261\nEp,min\n\nThe upper limits of P (z = 1) for different spectral index \u03b3g are shown in Fig.2 (the upper panel) with a fixed\nmaximum proton energy Ep,max = 1021 eV (but different minimum energies) for different source density evolution scenarios. The values are in the range of a few\n1045 to a few 1046 ergMpc\u22123 yr\u22121 . The upper limit for\nthe SFH case is the highest because of the slowest redshift evolution and smaller \u03b20,em at lower redshifts. As\na comparison, we also show the gamma-ray emissivity of\nGRBs and BL Lac objects at redshift z = 1. Though\n\n\f4\nthe local gamma-ray emissivity of GRBs inferred by different groups are different by about one order of magnitude (Guetta et al. 2005; Le & Dermer 2007; Wanderman & Piran 2010), the inferred emissivity in GRBs\nat redshift z = 1 has a much smaller uncertainty, being 1.1 \u00d7 1044 (\u2206t/10s)ergMpc\u22123 yr\u22121 in Guetta et al.\n(2005), 1.8 \u00d7 1044 (\u2206t/10s)ergMpc\u22123 yr\u22121 in Wanderman\n& Piran (2010), and 2.5 \u00d7 1044 (\u2206t/10s)ergMpc\u22123 yr\u22121\nin Le & Dermer (2007), where \u2206t is the mean duration of long GRB in the explosion frame. By comparison with the upper limits on the UHECR emissivity,\nwe find that the ratio between the two emissivities is\nPCR (1017 \u22121021 eV)/P\u03b3 . 101.5 for a flat cosmic ray spectrum \u03b3g \u2243 2.0.\nDermer & Razzaque (2010) recently obtained the\ngamma-ray emissivity of different classes of AGNs. The\ntwo bright classes at high redshift are BL Lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). The\ngamma-ray emissivity in BL Lac objects and FSRQs\nat z = 1 are, respectively, 6 \u00d7 1046 ergMpc\u22123 yr\u22121 and\n1.5 \u00d7 1046 ergMpc\u22123 . If these sources produce UHECRs,\nwe have PCR (1017 \u2212 1021eV)/P\u03b3 . 0.1 for \u03b3g \u2243 2.0. This\nsuggests that either a small fraction of the BL Lac objects in the distant universe are capable of accelerating\nprotons to ultra-high energies or the baryon-electron ratio in these sources is significantly smaller than one.\nThough there are few astrophysical sources that can accelerate protons to energies beyond 1020 eV, there should\nbe more sources in the universe that can accelerate protons to a lower Ep,max . For example, accretion shocks\nin clusters of galaxies may be able to accelerate protons\nto 1018 \u2212 1019 eV (e.g. Inoue et al. 2005). These ultrahigh energy protons produce diffuse gamma-ray emission as well. Therefore, the observed extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background also constrains the UHECR\nemissivity produced by these lower Ep,max accelerators.\nThe upper limits of UHECR emissivity for different\nEp,max are shown in Fig.3. It shows that for lower Ep,max\naccelerators, the UHECR emissivity could be higher, but\nit must still be lower than \u223c 1047 ergMpc\u22123 yr\u22121 at z = 1.\n3.4. The effect of intergalactic magnetic field on the\n\ncascade radiation\nWhen the intergalactic magnetic fields are strong, the\nsynchrotron cooling of the secondary electrons produced\nby UHECRs propagating in the intergalactic space could\ndominate over the inverse-Compton cooling and as a result, the cascade energy is reduced to some extent compared to the case without the magnetic fields. Unfortunately, very little is known about the origin, spatial\nconfiguration and amplitude of the intergalactic magnetic fields. Only upper limit on the intergalactic magnetic fields is obtained from Faraday rotation measurements, i.e. B . 10\u22128 G(lc /1Mpc)\u22121/2 , where lc is the\ncoherence length scale of the fields (e.g. Ryu et al.\n1998). Following Gabici & Aharonian (2005) and Kotera\net al. (2011), the effective inverse Compton cooling\ntime on the CMB and radio backgrounds can be written as te\u03b3 \u2243 5 \u00d7 1014 s(Ee /1018 eV)\u03b1IC , with \u03b1IC =1\nif the electron energy Ee . 1018 eV and \u03b1IC =0.25 if\n1018 eV . Ee . 1020 eV. Above 1020 eV, te\u03b3 \u2243 1.6 \u00d7\n1015 s(Ee /1020 eV). In comparison, the synchrotron cooling time is teB \u2243 4 \u00d7 1014 s(B/1nG)\u22122 (Ee /1018 eV)\u22121 .\n\nThe opposite scalings of te\u03b3 and teB with electron energy\nimply the existence of a cross-over energy Ee,cr , above\nwhich electrons cool mainly via synchrotron radiation\ninstead of undergoing an inverse Compton cascade, i.e.\n\u22121\n\u22121.6\nEe,cr = 1018 eVBnG\nfor B & 1nG, Ee,cr = 1018 eVBnG\n\u22121\nfor 1nG & B & 0.1nG, and Ee,cr = 5 \u00d7 1020 eVB0.01nG\nfor B . 0.1nG (Kotera et al. 2011). Since the energy\nof secondary electrons produced by UHE protons is a\nfraction of 1/20 or 10\u22123 of the parent proton energy in\nthe photopion or photopair process, electrons with energies above Ee,cr & 1018 eV can be produced only by the\nphotopion process of UHE protons. In Fig.4, we show\nthe fraction energy loss of UHE protons into the cascade\nEM component (i.e. excluding the synchrotron radiation) in the presence of the intergalactic magnetic fields\n(for three cases of B = 0.01, 0.1 and 1 nG ). It shows that\nthis fraction drops significantly as the magnetic fields increase for protons above the photopion threshold energy.\nWe further calculate the cascade energy density \u03c9\u03b3B in\nthe presence of intergalactic magnetic fields. In Fig.5,\nwe show the ratio of the cascade energy densities in the\npresence of a magnetic field (\u03c9\u03b3B ) and in its absence (\u03c9\u03b3 )\nas a function of the maximum proton energy for different\nUHECR source populations. When Ep,max is large, up to\n\u223c 45% of the cascade energy is lost into the synchrotron\nradiation.\nThe characteristic energy of the synchrotron radiation\nis E\u03b3,syn \u2243 6.8GeVBnG (Ee /1019 eV)2 . So when the magnetic fields are stronger, e.g. 1nG < B < 10nG, the synchrotron peak falls at 10-100 GeV. Thus the synchrotron\ncomponent in fact also contributes to EGRB, although\nits spectrum is different from that of the cascade radiation. Therefore we conclude that the presence of intergalactic magnetic fields affects the upper limits of the\nUHECR emissivity by a factor . 2.\n3.5. The upper bound on the cosmogenic neutrino flux\n\nOnce we know the upper bound on the UHECR emissivity, we can get the upper bound on the cosmogenic\nneutrino flux. As the energy loss distance for protons of\nenergy above the photopion production threshold in interactions with CMB photons is relatively short (. 300\nMpc), it is reasonable to assume that cosmic rays at these\nenergies lose all of their energy locally. Following Engel\net al. (2001) and Yuksel & Kistler (2007), we use the approximation that the fraction of the original proton energy that is lost to neutrinos can be parametrized with\na gradual step function \u03c8(Ep ) = 0.45/(1 + (Et /Ep )2 ),\nwhere 0.45 is the asymptotic fraction of injected cosmicray energy transferred to neutrinos above 1021 eV and\nEt \u223c 2 \u00d7 1020 eV. Thus, the total \u03bd\u03bc + \u03bd\u0304\u03bc energy flux at\nEarth can be written as a sum of the contributions by individual UHECR sources that are generated at different\ncosmological epochs, i.e.\nZ zmax\ndEps dt\n1\nc\n\u03c8(Eps (1 + z))Lp (t)\ndz,\nE\u03bd J\u03bd =\n4\u03c0 0\n1+z\ndE\u03bd dz\n(16)\nwhere Eps = 20(1 + z)E\u03bd (approximating each daughter neutrino receiving about 1/20 of the injected proton\nenergy).\nThe results are shown in Fig.6 for Ep,min = 1017 eV,\nEmax = 1021 eV and a flat proton spectrum with \u03b3g = 2.\n\n\f5\nIn contrast to Berezinsky et al. (2011) and Ahlers et al.\n(2010), we relax the requirement that the accumulated\nUHECR flux from a homogenous population of sources\nin the whole universe fit the observed energy spectrum\nof UHECRs since UHECRs above 1019 eV are produced\ndominantly by local sources within hundreds of Mpc and\nthe UHECR emissivity in the distant universe could be\nirrelevant. As a result, the upper bound on cosmogenic\nneutrino flux shown in Fig.6 represents a true upper\nbound that is independent of the unknown density distribution of nearby sources that contribute to the observed\nUHECR flux. This upper bound is below the sensitivity\nof Auger and is marginally reachable by Icecube and the\nnext-generation detector JEM-EUSO.\nThe commonly-used Waxman-Bahcall bound (Waxman & Bahcall 1999) for high-energy neutrinos also assumes that UHECR emissivity in the distant universe is\nconnected with the flux of observed UHECRs that are\nproduced by local sources. Without any independent\nconstraints, the UHECR emissivity in the distant universe could in principal be arbitrarily high. However,\nwith the upper limit of the cascade radiation, the constraints on the UHECR emissivity in the distant universe becomes possible now and hence the neutrino upper\nbound becomes solid.\n4. THE IRON NUCLEI CASE\n\nThe composition of UHECRs remains disputed. Although HiRes observations favor proton composition\n(Abbasi et al. 2010), recent observations by Pierre\nAuger Observatory (PAO) show a transition in the maximum shower elongations < Xmax > and in their fluctuations RMS(Xmax ) between 5EeV and 10EeV (Abraham et al. 2010), which are interpreted as reflecting a\ntransition in the composition of UHECR in this energy\nrange from protons to heavier mass nuclei. However,\none should be cautious that this claim depends on the\npoorly-understood hadronic interaction models at such\nhigh energies. In this section, we study the heavy nuclei\ncomposition case. For simplicity, a pure iron composition above 1019 eV is assumed in our calculation and\nthe maximum energy of iron nuclei is fixed at 1021 eV.\nAs the corresponding maximum energy of one nucleon\nis only 1.8 \u00d7 1019 eV, which is below the threshold energy for photopion production of protons interacting with\nCMB photons even at high redshifts, we can neglect the\nphotopion energy loss for these UHE iron nuclei.\nFor an Fe nucleus generated at cosmological time t(z),\nit suffers from both energy loss due to Bethe-Heitler process and nucleon loss due to photo-disintegration during\nthe propagation in the intergalactic space. Let's denote\n\u03b3N (t) as the Lorentz factor of the nucleus and A(t) as\nthe mass number of the nucleus. As the Lorentz factor\nof the nucleus is conserved during photo-disintegration,\nthe energy loss is due to Bethe-Heitler cooling and adiabatic expansion of the universe. The energy loss due\nto de-excitation of nuclei following photo-disintegration\ninteractions is found to be always less efficient than the\nBethe-Heitler energy loss (Aharonian & Taylor 2010), so\nit can be safely neglected. So the the evolution of \u03b3N (t)\nwith time is given by\nd\u03b3N (t)\n= \u03b3N (t)H(z) + \u03b3\u0307N,BH (t, A),\ndt\n\n(17)\n\nwhere\n2\n\n\u03b3\u0307N,BH (t, A) = ZA \u03b3\u0307p,BH (t)\nR\u221e\nR\u221e\n2\nn (\u03b5)\n= ZA 2\u03b3cN \u03b5th d\u03b5\u03b3 \u03c3BH (\u03b5\u03b3 )f (\u03b5\u03b3 )\u03b5\u03b3 \u03b5\u03b3 /2\u0393 d\u03b5 \u03b3\u03b52\n\n(18)\n\nis the Bethe-Heitler energy loss rate for nucleus of charge\nZ and mass number A, \u03b3\u0307p,BH (t) is the Bethe-Heitler energy loss rate for protons of the same Lorentz factor \u03b3N .\nThe photo-disintegration results in nucleon loss of nuclei,\nso the mass number evolves with time as\ndA(t)\n= RA (t, \u03b3N ),\ndt\n\n(19)\n\nwhere\nRA (t, \u03b3N ) =\n\nc\n2\n2\u03b3N\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03b5\u03c3A (\u03b5)\u03b5\n\u03b5th\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndxx\u22122 n\u03b3 (x)\n\n\u03b5/2\u03b3N\n\n(20)\nis the total photo-disintegration rate for nucleus with\nLorentz factor \u03b3N and mass number A, \u03c3A (\u01eb) is the total\nphotodisintegration cross section, and \u03b5th is the threshold energy of the photon in the nucleus rest frame.\nIt is found that the single nucleon loss is the dominant\nchannel for photo-disintegration of heavy nuclei (Puget\net al. 1976), so as a good approximation, we here only\nconsider single nucleon loss channel in the following calculation. This approximation results in an error less\nthan 30% for nucleus with Lorentz factor smaller than\n2 \u00d7 1010 (corresponding to energy . 1021 eV for an iron\nnucleus)(Puget et al. 1976). The cross-sections for photodisintegration in the energy range \u03b5th < \u03b5 . 30 MeV\nwith single nucleon loss is dominated by the giant dipole\nresonance (GDR), which can be approximately described\nby a Lorentzian form (Puget et al. 1976; Anchordoqui\net al. 2007) as\n\u03c3A (\u03b5) =\n\n\u03c30,A \u03b52 \u22062GDR\n,\n(\u03b520 \u2212 \u03b52 )2 + \u03b52 \u22062GDR\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u2206GDR and \u03c30,A are the width and maximum\nvalue of the cross section, \u03b50 is the energy at which\nthe cross section peaks. Fitted numerical values are\n\u03c30,A = 1.45A \u00d7 10\u221227 cm2 , \u2206GDR = 8 MeV, and\n\u03b50 = 42.65A\u22120.21 (0.925A2.433 ) MeV for A > 4 (A < 4)\n(Karakula & Tkaczyk 1993).\nCombining Eq.(18) and Eq.(20), one can obtain \u03b3N (t)\nand A(t). Denote tA=1 as the time when the mass number of a parent nucleus drops to A = 1. Then, one can\ncalculate the energy lost into the EM component by an\ns\nFe nucleus with an initial energy EN\nduring the whole\nperiod from the the injection time t(z) to the present\ntime\nR t(z)\nN\ns\ns\n\u03b2em\n(EN\n, t)EN\n\u2261 tA=1 [\u03b3\u0307N,BH (t, A)A(t) + (56 \u2212 A)\nRt\n\u00d7\u03b3\u0307p,BH (t)]mp c2 dt + 0 A=1 [56\u03b3\u0307p,BH (t)]mp c2 dt,\n(22)\nwhere the second term on the right side is the BetheHeitler energy loss for those secondary nucleons that have\nbeen already disintegrated from the parent nucleus. Note\nthat, for the sake of analytic calculations, we have assumed that all the secondary nucleons that have been\ndisintegrated from the parent nucleus have an averaged\n\u03b3p at some time t, which is a good approximation since\n\n\f6\na useful probe of the UHECR emissivity in the distant\nuniverse, since this cascade gamma-ray radiation can be\nobserved directly. Using the new Fermi/LAT measurement of the EGBR, we obtained upper limits on the\nUHECR emissivity in the distant universe through an\nanalytic treatment. Both proton composition and pure\niron composition cases are studied. These limits are\nthen compared with the gamma-ray emissivity of candidate UHECR sources, i.e. GRBs and AGNs, at high\nredshifts. We find that, for a flat proton spectrum, the\nupper limit of the UHECR emissivity is a few tens times\nlarger than the observed gamma-ray emissivity in GRBs,\nwhile it is about one order of magnitude smaller than the\ngamma-ray emissivity in BL Lac objects. We also find\nthat the presence of intergalactic magnetic fields has insignificant effect on the derived upper limit. Furthermore, an upper limit on the cosmogenic neutrino flux is\nobtained from the upper limit of UHECR emissivity. In\ncontrast to Berezinsky et al.

The rise of\nN\n\u03b2em\nat higher energies is due to the contributions by the\nnucleons that have been disintegrated from the parent\nnucleus. For an iron nucleus generated at z & 1 with an\nenergy & 5 \u00d7 1019 eV, more than a half of the nucleus\nenergy is lost into the EM cascade radiation. Compared\nwith the proton case, the energy loss fraction is smaller\nat energies EFe . 1020 eV.\nSimilar to the proton case, we can calculate the corresponding energy that remains at the present epoch,\nN\ns\n\u03b20,em\nEN\n, by taking into account the redshift energy loss.\nFinally, we obtain the cascade energy density produced\nby the whole UHECR source population in the universe\n\nREFERENCES\nAbbasi, R.
