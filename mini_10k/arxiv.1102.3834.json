Gabach Cl\u00e9ment\nNovember 5, 2018\nAbstract\nWe extend the results presented by Ace\u00f1a et al in the afore mentioned paper, [1], to the case of axisymmetric, maximal initial data\nwhich are invariant under an inversion transformation.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn [1] it is proven that for a large class of axisymmetric, vacuum and\nmaximal initial data, with a non-negative cosmological constant, having a surface \u03a3 = {r = constant} where the following local conditions\nare satisfied\nH = 0,\n\n(1)\n\n\u2202r H \u2265 0,\n\n(2)\n\n\u2202r q = 0,\n\n(3)\n\nthen the following inequality holds\n8\u03c0|J| \u2264 A,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere A is the area and J the angular momentum of \u03a3.\nWe refere the reader to [1] for the detailed description of the axisymmetric, maximal initial data.\nIn this note, we prove that that the above result also applies to\nmore general surfaces \u03a3 = {r \u2212 Rc(\u03b8) = 0} if one assumes that \u03a3 is an\nisometry surface, together with condition (2) for its mean curvature.\nThis result is especially relevant for the case where there are multiple black holes, since in that situation one would expect that the\nsurface of isometry is not one with constant radius.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMain Result\n\nConsider an axially symmetric, maximal initial data set for Einstein's\nequations having the following induced 3-metric on a spatial hipersurface S\n\u0002\n\u0003\nh = e\u03c3 e2q (dr 2 + r 2 d\u03b8 2 ) + r 2 sin2 \u03b8(d\u03c6 + vr dr + v\u03b8 d\u03b8)2 ,\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c3, q, vr and v\u03b8 are regular functions of r and \u03b8. Moreover, the\ndata have angular momentum J (see [1] for information concerning\nthe extrinsic curvature of the data).\nLet the 3-metric h be invariant under the inversion transformation\nr \u2192 R2 c2 (\u03b8)/r, where c(\u03b8) is a smooth function of \u03b8 and let \u03a3 be\na 2-surface that is fixed by such transformation. Then the isometry\nimplies the following conditions\nH|\u03a3 = 0,\n\n\u2202r q|\u03a3 = 0,\n\nvr |\u03a3 = 0.\n\nThe area of \u03a3 is given by\nZ 2\u03c0 Z \u03c0\np\nA=\ne\u03c3+q R2 sin \u03b8|c| (c2 + c\u20322 )d\u03b8d\u03c6,\n0\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n0\n\nand one can easily check that\nZ 2\u03c0 Z \u03c0\ne\u03c3+q R2 c2 sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c6.\nA\u2265\n0\n\n(8)\n\n0\n\nWe define the function \u03c2 in terms of \u03c3 in the following way\n\u03c2 := \u03c3 + 2 ln r\nand obtain\nA \u2265 2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n(9)\n\n\u03c0\n\ne\u03c2+q sin \u03b8d\u03b8.\n\n(10)\n\n0\n\nThen, using Einstein's constraints and the maximality condition, we\ncan bound the right hand side of (10) with the mass functional M\nintroduced in [1]\nM F +G\n(11)\nA \u2265 4\u03c0e 8 e 16\u03c0 ,\nwhere M, F, G are avaluated at \u03a3.\nThen we obtain the following theorem\nTheorem 2.1. Consider axisymmetric, vacuum and maximal initial\ndata, with a non-negative cosmological constant as described above.\nAssume there exists a surface \u03a3 which is invariant under an inversion\ntransformation and such that\n\u2202r H \u2265 0\n\n2\n\n(12)\n\n\fholds on \u03a3. Then we have\n8\u03c0|J| \u2264 A\n\n(13)\n\nwhere A is the area and J the angular momentum of \u03a3.\nProof. In [1] it was proven that if the first two conditions in (6), and\n(12) are valid, then the right hand side of (11) is bounded from below\nby 8\u03c0|J|: since the first two conditions are automatically satisfied for\nan inversion-fixed surface, we obtain the desired result.\nAcknowledgments.
