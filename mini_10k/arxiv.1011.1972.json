Establishing high-quality entanglement, however, is a necessary prerequisite for performing quantum teleportation [1] between far distant laboratories or developing deviceindependent cryptographic technologies [2, 3]. One strategy for dealing with this difficulty\nis to employ quantum repeaters, stations intermediate between the sender and receiver that\ncan participate in the process of entanglement distillation, thereby improving on what the\nsender and receiver could do on their own [4, 5, 6, 7]. In this article, we introduce and study\nandutil79@gmail.com\nb patrick@cs.mcgill.ca\n\n1\n\n\f2 Assisted Entanglement Distillation\n\nQUANTA\n\nQCM\n\nEPIQ\nCQIQC\n\nIQC\nLITQ\n\nCQIL\n\nFig. 1. A hypothetical quantum network connecting various university quantum laboratories. Repeater\nstations are represented by black dots.\n\na version of the entanglement of assistance [8] appropriate to the study of such mixed state\nassisted distillation problems in the context of quantum Shannon theory.\nA single copy version of this problem was analyzed in the context of spin chains under the name of localizable entanglement [9]. This quantity, along with others such as the\naverage singlet conversion probability (SCP) [10, 11, 12], can be used as figures of merit\nfor characterizing quantum networks. A quantum network [10, 12, 13, 14, 15] consists of\nspatially separated nodes connected by quantum communication channels. Each node of\nthe network represents local physical systems which hold quantum information, stored in\nquantum memories. The information stored at the node can then be processed locally by using optical beam splitters [16] and planar lightwave circuits [17], among other technologies.\nEntanglement between neighboring nodes can be established by locally preparing a state at\none node and distributing part of it to the neighboring node using the physical medium connecting the two nodes. One of the main tasks then becomes the design of protocols that use\nthe entanglement between the neighboring nodes to establish pure entanglement between\nthe non adjacent nodes.\nIn [10, 12], several strategies were analyzed for one-dimensional and two-dimensional\ngeometries. In these simplified networks, each pair of nodes shares a pure state |\u03c8i =\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03bb1 |00i + \u03bb2 |11i. For the case of a one-dimensional chain with only one repeater node,\nit was found that by applying an entanglement swapping protocol consisting of a Bell measurement at the repeater node, one can achieve a singlet conversion probability equal to the\noptimal singlet conversion probability for the state |\u03c8i. That is, the repeater node does not\nreduce the likelihood of recovering a maximally entangled pair between Alice and Bob's\nlaboratories. This desirable property is not preserved, however, for chains consisting of\nmany repeater stations separating the two laboratories. It was shown in [10] that no measurement strategy can keep the SCP between Alice and Bob from decreasing exponentially\nwith the number of repeaters, making them useless for establishing entanglement over long\ndistances.\nOne way to deal with this problem is to introduce redundancy in the network [4]. By\n\n\fN. Dutil and P. Hayden\n\n3\n\npreparing and distributing many copies of the state |\u03c8i across the chain, the repeater stations\nwill be able to help Alice and Bob in producing singlets. The redundancy introduced in the\nnetwork allows the stations to perform joint measurements on their shares, concentrating the\nentanglement found in each copy of |\u03c8i into a small number of highly entangled particles.\nFor one-dimensional chains, the rate at which entanglement can be established between the\ntwo endpoints will approach the entropy of entanglement S(A)\u03c8 , no matter the number of\nrepeaters introduced between the endpoints. The more copies of the state |\u03c8i are prepared\nand distributed between the nodes, the more transparent the repeaters will become, allowing\nus to view the entire chain as a noiseless channel for Alice and Bob.\nThis is an ideal situation unlikely to occur in real experiments, as only a finite number of\ncopies of the state |\u03c8i will be prepared and the preparation and distribution of copies of this\nstate across the network will be imperfect. It is also reasonable to assume that the storage of\nmany qubits at a repeater station, or at one of the laboratories, will be more prone to errors\nover time than the storage of a single qubit. Hence, the global state of a quantum network\nwill most likely be mixed. For such mixed state networks, we can ask the question: how\nmuch entanglement can we establish between Alice and Bob by performing local operations\nand classical communication (LOCC) on the systems part of the network ?\nIn this paper, we extend the models previously studied in [10, 12] to allow for an arbitrary mixed state between adjacent nodes. This is an initial step towards handling more\ncomplex and realistic situations. First, we will consider a network consisting of two receiving nodes (Alice and Bob), separated by a repeater node (Charlie), whose global state is a\nmixed state \u03c8 ABC . We study the optimal distillable rate achievable for Alice and Bob when\nassistance from Charlie is available. This problem reduces to the two-way distillable entanglement for states in a product form \u03c8 C \u2297 \u03c8 AB . There is currently no simple formula for\ncomputing the two-way distillable entanglement of a bipartite state \u03c8 AB , which has been\nstudied extensively by Bennett et al. and others in [18, 19, 20, 21]. We do not attempt to\nsolve this problem here, and turn our attention instead to good computable lower bounds\nfor assisted distillation of mixed states. We provide a bound which generically exceeds the\nhashing inequality for states \u03c8 ABC when the coherent information from C to AB is positive.\nWe will also consider a more general scenario where many spatially separated helpers perform measurements on their share of the state and send their results to two recipients, who\nthen exploit this information to extract a greater amount of maximally entangled pairs.\nStructure of the paper: Section 2 begins with a quick review of the main results for the\nentanglement of assistance problem, and introduces the extension to the general mixed state\nscenario. In Section 3, we define the one-shot entanglement of assistance. We show that\nits regularization is equal to the optimal assisted distillation rate achievable for the scenario\nintroduced in Section 2. We then derive two upper bounds for this one-shot quantity, and\ngive some examples of classes of states attaining them. Next, in Section 4, we introduce\na protocol, based on a random coding strategy, which achieves a rate that is strictly better\nthan the hashing bound under appropriate conditions. Finally, in Section 5, we generalize\nthe previous scenario to the case of many helpers. An appendix, containing a few technical\nproofs, appears at the end.\nNotation: In this paper, we restrict our attention to finite dimensional Hilbert spaces.\nQuantum systems under consideration will be denoted A, B, . . . , and are freely associated\n\n\f4 Assisted Entanglement Distillation\n\nwith their Hilbert spaces, whose (finite) dimensions are denoted dA , dB , . . .. If A and B\nare two Hilbert spaces, we write AB \u2261 A \u2297 B for their tensor product. Unless otherwise\nstated, a \"state\" can be either pure or mixed. The symbol for such a state (such as \u03c8 and \u03c1)\nalso denotes its density matrix. The density matrix |\u03c8ih\u03c8| of a pure state will frequently be\nwritten as \u03c8. We write S(A)\u03c8 = \u2212Tr(\u03c8 A log \u03c8 A ) to denote the p\nvon Neumann entropy of a\ndensity matrix \u03c8 A for the system A. The function F (\u03c1, \u03c3) := Tr \u03c11/2 \u03c3\u03c11/2 is the Uhlmann\nfidelity between the two \u221a\nstates \u03c1 and \u03c3 [22, 23]. The trace norm kXk1 of an operator X is\n\u2297n\ndefined to be Tr|X| = Tr X \u2020 X. The typical subspace \u00c3n\u03c8,\u03b4 associated with the state \u03c8A\nis\nwritten as \u00c3. Finally, the probability of an event X is denoted as P (X).\n2 The Task\nRefs. [8] and [24] introduced the following quantity, called the entanglement of assistance of a\nbipartite mixed state \u03c1AB :\nEA (\u03c1AB ) := max\nE\n\nX\n\npi S(\u03c8iAB ),\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nwhere the maximum is over all decompositions of \u03c1AB into a convex combination of pure\nstates E = {pi , \u03c8iAB }. Suppose that |\u03c8iABC is a purification of \u03c8 AB . By acting on the purification system C, the helper Charlie can effect any such pure state convex decomposition\nP\n\u03c1AB = i pi \u03c8iAB for Alice and Bob's state [25, 26], and so the quantity EA maximizes the\namount of entanglement that Alice and Bob can distill with help from Charlie. Since EA is\nnot, in general, additive under tensor products [8], it will often be the case that entangled\nmeasurements performed by Charlie on the joint state (\u03c8 C )\u2297n will be more beneficial to Alice and Bob than separate measurements on individual copies of \u03c8 C . Thus, allowing for\nmany copies of the state \u03c8 ABC , we can ask: what is the optimal asymptotic distillable rate between Alice and Bob with help from Charlie under LOCC? The answer to this question was given\n\u221e\nin [27], where it was shown that the optimal asymptotic rate, denoted by EA\n, is equal to the\nregularization of EA :\n1\n\u2297n\n\u221e\n).\n(2)\nEA\n(\u03c8 ABC ) = lim EA (\u03c8ABC\nn\u2192\u221e n\n\u221e\nFurthermore, a simple expression for EA\nin terms of entropic quantities was also obtained:\n\u221e\nEA\n(\u03c8 ABC ) = min{S(A)\u03c8 , S(B)\u03c8 }.\n\n(3)\n\nA detailed proof of this statement can be found in [27]. To understand how powerful thirdparty assistance is, we need only observe that if \u03c8 AB were pure, the distillable entanglement\nwould be given by the entropy S(A)\u03c8 = S(B)\u03c8 . Thus, assistance by a third party holding\nthe purification C is equivalent to giving C to one of Alice and Bob, whichever will result in\nthe least bipartite entanglement. (The achievability of these rates will also follow from our\nmore general Theorem 8.)\nIn this section, we extend these ideas to the case of a general mixed state, with a measurement of Charlie's system followed by an entanglement distillation protocol between Alice\nand Bob. The problem is illustrated in Figure 2.\n\n\fN. Dutil and P. Hayden\n\n5\n\nBn\nB1\n\nCn\n\u2297n\n\u03c8CAB\n\nA1\n\nAn\n\nFig. 2.

The optimal rate is denoted by DA\n(\u03c8 ABC ).\nIt is the asymptotic entanglement of assistance.\nWe call a protocol which satisfies the constraint of Problem 1 a broadcast assisted distillation\nprotocol. More formally, it consists of\n(i) A POVM E = (Ex )X\nx=1 for Charlie.

Lastly, we have\n\u221e\nDA\n(\u03c8 ABC ) := sup{R : R is achievable}.\n\n(7)\n\n\f6 Assisted Entanglement Distillation\n\nThe restriction to POVMs with rank one operators in the preceding definition can be\njustified as follows: any POVM F containing positive operators with rank higher than one\nthat Charlie would wish to perform can be simulated by a POVM E with rank one operators\non Charlie's system followed by some processing by Alice and Bob. More precisely, suppose\nCharlie wants to perform a POVM F = {Fx } on his state with some operators having rank\ngreater than one.

Applying\nthis observation to the definition of the one-shot entanglement of assistance yields the result.\nWe can interpret Eq. (13) as follows: by varying a POVM on his state, Charlie can collapse the purified state \u03c8 ABCR into any pure state ensemble decomposition {pi , \u03c8iABR } for\nthe A,B, and R systems. Since we don't have access to the purifying system R, the quantity DA (\u03c8 ABC ) maximizes the average amount of distillable entanglement between Alice\nand Bob. The next result shows that the regularized version of DA is in fact equal to the\n\u221e\nasymptotic entanglement of assistance DA\n(\u03c8 ABC ).\n3.2\n\nBasic properties\n\nTheorem 4 (Equivalence) Let \u03c8 ABC be an arbitrary tripartite state.

Using the convexity of the coherent information [29], the\nhashing inequality, and the definitions of D and DA , we get the following series of inequalities:\nlog Mn \u2264 I(A1 iB1 )\u03a9 + 3 log(Mn )\u03b7(\u01eb\u2032 )\nX\n\u2264\npx I(A1 iB1 )\u03a9x + 3 log(Mn )\u03b7(\u01eb\u2032 )\nx\n\n\u2264\n\n\u2264\n\nX\n\npx D(\u03a9xA1 B1 ) + 3 log(Mn )\u03b7(\u01eb\u2032 )\n\nx\n\nX\n\npx D(\u03c8xA\n\nn\n\nBn\n\n) + 3 log(Mn )\u03b7(\u01eb\u2032 )\n\nx\n\n\u2264 DA ((\u03c8 ABC )\u2297n ) + 3n log(dA )\u03b7(\u01eb\u2032 ).\nSince \u01eb \u2192 0 and\n\n1\nn\n\n(20)\n1\nDA (\u03c8 \u2297n ),\nn\u2192\u221e n\n\nlog(Mn ) \u2192 R as n \u2192 \u221e, the achievable rate R is at most lim\n\nwhich proves the \"\u2264\" part since R was arbitrarily chosen.\nTo show the \"\u2265\" part, suppose Charlie performs any POVM E = (Ex ) on one copy of\nthe state \u03c8 ABC and broadcasts the result to Alice and Bob.

Group the outcome states\ninto blocks, where each block corresponds to a specific measurement outcome. For each of\nthese blocks, there exist LOCC operations Vx which will distill arbitrarily close to the rate\nP\nD(\u03c8xAB ). Thus, there is a protocol achieving the rate x px D(\u03c8xAB ), which proves the \"\u2265\"\npart.\nFinding a formula for the one-shot quantity DA (\u03c8 ABC ) appears to be a difficult problem,\nand so we look for upper bounds which are attained for a subset of all possible states. For the\nremainder of this section, we look at two upper bounds and give examples of states attaining\nthem.\nProposition 5 Let \u03c8 ABC be an arbitrary tripartite state. We have the following upper bound for\nDA (\u03c8 ABC ):\nX\n(23)\npi EA (\u03c8iABC ),\nDA (\u03c8 ABC ) \u2264 inf\nE\n\ni\n\nP\nwhere the infimum is taken over all ensembles of pure states {pi , \u03c8iABC } such that \u03c8 ABC = i pi \u03c8iABC .\nP\nProof: Let \u03c8 ABC = i pi \u03c8iABC , where the states \u03c8iABC are pure. Consider the following\nP\nclassical-quantum state \u03c6ABCX = i pi \u03c8iABC \u2297 |iihi|X . If Charlie is in possession of the X\nsystem, then\nX\n(24)\npi \u03c8iABC ) \u2264 DA (\u03c6ABCX )\nDA (\u03c8 ABC ) = DA (\ni\n\nby the definition of DA . Now, for a pure state \u03c8iABC , the one-shot quantity DA (\u03c8iABC ) is also\nequal to the one-shot entanglement of assistance EA (\u03c8iABC ). For the state \u03c6ABCX , we have\nDA (\u03c6ABCX ) =\n\nX\n\npi DA (\u03c8iABC ) =\n\nX\n\npi EA (\u03c8iABC ).\n\n(25)\n\ni\n\ni\n\nAchievability is obtained by considering the POVM G = {Gix } with positive operators\nGix = Exi \u2297 |iihi|X , where E i = {Exi } is the POVM maximizing Eq. (12) for the state \u03c8iABC .\nOptimality follows from the convexity of DA (\u03c6ABCX ) on the ensemble {pi , \u03c8iABC \u2297 |iihi|X }\n(see Proposition 21) and the fact that DA (\u03c8iABC \u2297 |iihi|X ) = DA (\u03c8iABC ).\nP\nHence, we have DA (\u03c8 ABC ) \u2264 i pi EA (\u03c8iABC ), and since this holds for any pure state\nensemble {pi , \u03c8iABC }, we arrive at the statement of the proposition.\nWith this result in hand, we now exhibit a set of states for which we can compute the\nvalue of DA exactly.\nExample 1 Consider the following family of classical-quantum states, with classical system C:\n\u03c8\n\nABC\n\n=\n\ndC\nX\ni=1\n\npi \u03c8iAB \u2297 |iihi|C ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u03c8iAB are pure states. Since DA is convex on pure ensembles {pi , \u03c8iABC }, the quantity DA (\u03c8 ABC )\nP\nis upper bounded by i pi DA (\u03c8iAB \u2297 |iihi|C ). Since assistance is not helpful for a product state\n\u03c8 AB \u2297 \u03c6C , we have that DA (\u03c8iAB \u2297 |iihi|C ) = D(\u03c8iAB ) = S(A)\u03c8i . By considering the POVM\n\n\f10\n\nAssisted Entanglement Distillation\n\nP\nP\nC\n, we also have DA (\u03c8 ABC ) \u2265 i pi D(\u03c8iAB ) = i pi S(A)\u03c8i . Hence, for this speE = {|iihi|C }di=1\ncial class of classical-quantum states, the upper bound is attained and DA is just the average entropy\nof the A system for the ensemble {pi , \u03c8iAB }.\nProposition 6 Let \u03c8 ABC be an arbitrary tripartite state. Then\nDA (\u03c8 ABC ) \u2264 EA (\u03c8 ABC ).\n\n(27)\n\nProof: From Proposition 5 and the concavity of the entanglement of assistance quantity EA\n(see [8] for a proof), we have\nX\npi EA (\u03c8iABC )\nDA (\u03c8 ABC ) \u2264 inf\nE\n\ni\n\nX\npi \u03c8iABC )\n\u2264 inf EA (\nE\n\ni\n\n= EA (\u03c8 ABC )\n\n(28)\n\nwhere the infimum is taken over all pure state ensembles {pi , \u03c8iABC } of the state \u03c8 ABC .\nThe previous bound on DA is better understood by imagining the following scenario.\n\u2032\nThe A\u2032 system of a pure state \u03c8 AA is sent to a receiver (i.e Bob) via a noisy channel N , which\ncan be expressed in its Stinespring form as N (\u03c8) = TrE U \u03c1U \u2020 , where U : A\u2032 \u2192 BE is an\nisometry. Another player, Charlie, tries to help Alice and Bob by measuring the environment\nand sending its measurement outcome to Alice and Bob. Two cases can occur. If Charlie has\ncomplete access to the environment, the best rate Alice and Bob can achieve is given by the\nentanglement of assistance EA (\u03c8 ABC ). More likely, however, is the case where Charlie will\nonly be able to measure a subsystem C1 of the environment E = C1 C2 . In this situation, the\noptimal rate is given by the one-shot entanglement of assistance DA (\u03c8 ABC1 ), where \u03c8 ABC1 =\nTrC2 \u03c8 ABE . Since this case is more restrictive to Charlie in terms of measuring possibilities, it\nmakes sense that DA (\u03c8 ABC ) \u2264 EA (\u03c8 ABC ) for any tripartite mixed state \u03c8 ABC . This bound\nwill be attained for all pure states \u03c8 ABC since DA reduces to EA in this case.\n4 Achievable Rates for Assisted Distillation\nIn this section, we find the rates achieved by a random coding strategy for assisted entanglement distillation. The helper Charlie will simply perform a random measurement in his\ntypical subspace. In light of the equivalence demonstrated in the previous section, Eq. (14),\nwe will prove a lower bound on the asymptotic entanglement of assistance by bounding the\nregularized entanglement of assistance quantity. We will need the following lemma, which\nis derived from a proposition used in [30] (see also Appendix A) in the context of assisted\ndistillation of pure states.\nLemma 7 Suppose we have n copies of the pure state \u03c8 CABR with S(R)\u03c8 < S(AB)\u03c8 and S(B)\u03c8 <\nn n n\nS(AR)\u03c8 . Let \u03c8 C\u0303A B R be be the normalized state obtained after projecting the space C n into its\ntypical subspace C\u0303. If Charlie performs a (rank one) random measurement of his system C\u0303, we have,\nfor any fixed \u03be1 > 0 and \u03be2 > 0,\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\\\nn\nn\n(29)\nP k\u03c8JR \u2212 (\u03c8 R )\u2297n k1 < \u03be1\nk\u03c8JB \u2212 (\u03c8 B )\u2297n k1 < \u03be2 dU \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b1,\nU(C\u0303)\n\n\fN. Dutil and P. Hayden 11\n\nwhere \u03b1 can be made arbitrarily small by taking sufficiently large values of n. Here, J is the random\nn n n\nvariable associated with the measurement outcome and \u03c8JA B R is the pure state of the systems\nAn , B n and Rn after Charlie's measurement.\nSee Appendix A for a proof of Lemma 7. The following theorem generalizes the reasoning\nused in [30] to the mixed state case. The lower bound on the rate at which ebits are distilled,\ninvolving the minimum of I(ACiB)\u03c8 and I(AiBC)\u03c8 , suggests that C is merged either to\nAlice or Bob, at which point they engage in an entanglement distillation protocol achieving\nthe hashing bound. This need not be the case, however. In the discussion following the\nproof of the theorem, we will exhibit an example where merging is impossible but the rates\nare nonetheless achieved.\nTheorem 8 Let \u03c8 ABC be an arbitrary tripartite state shared by two recipients (Alice and Bob) and a\nhelper (Charlie). Then the asymptotic entanglement of assistance is bounded below as follows:\n\u221e\n(\u03c8 ABC ) \u2265 max{I(AiB)\u03c8 , L(\u03c8)},\nDA\n\n(30)\n\nwhere L(\u03c8) := min{I(ACiB)\u03c8 , I(AiBC)\u03c8 }.\n\u221e\nProof: That DA\n(\u03c8 ABC ) is always greater than or equal to the coherent information\nI(AiB)\u03c8 follows from the hashing inequality and the fact that Charlie's worst measurement\nis no worse than throwing away his system and letting Alice and Bob perform a two-way\n\u221e\ndistillation protocol without outside help. Hence, it remains to show that DA\n(\u03c8 ABC ) \u2265\nmin{I(ACiB)\u03c8 , I(AiBC)\u03c8 }.\n\u221e\nSince DA\n(\u03c8 ABC ) is equal to the regularization of DA (\u03c8 ABC ), we only need to show the\nexistence of a measurement for Charlie for which the average distillable entanglement is\nasymptotically close to L(\u03c8). We prove this fact via a protocol which uses a random coding\nstrategy. The state \u03c8 ABC and its purifying system R can be regarded as:\n\n(i) a tripartite system composed of C, AB, and R.\n(ii) a tripartite system composed of C, AR, and B.\nLet's consider n copies of \u03c8 ABC , and furthermore, let's assume that S(AB)\u03c8 (resp. S(AR)\u03c8 )\nand S(R)\u03c8 (resp. S(B)\u03c8 ) are different. This can be enforced by using only a sub-linear\namount of entanglement shared between chosen parties in the limit of large n. After Schu\u2297n\nmacher compressing his share of the state \u03c8C\n, Charlie performs a random measurement\nof his system C\u0303. Let J be the random variable associated with the measurement outcome\nn n n\nand let \u03c8JA B R be the state of the systems An , B n and Rn after Charlie's measurement. By\nLemma 7 and the Fannes inequality, there exists a measurement of Charlie's system which\nn n n\nwill produce a state \u03c8JA B R satisfying, with arbitrarily high probability:\nS(An B n )\u03c8J = S(Rn )\u03c8J = n(min{S(AB)\u03c8 , S(R)\u03c8 } \u00b1 \u03b4)\n\nS(An B n )\u03c8J = S(B n )\u03c8J = n(min{S(AR)\u03c8 , S(B)\u03c8 } \u00b1 \u03b4),\nwhere \u03b4 can be made arbitrarily small by choosing n large enough.\n\n(31)\n\n\f12\n\nAssisted Entanglement Distillation\n\nApplying the hashing inequality to such a state will give:\nD(\u03c8JA\n\nn\n\nBn\n\n) \u2265 S(B n )\u03c8J \u2212 S(An B n )\u03c8J\n\n= n(min{S(B)\u03c8 , S(AR)\u03c8 } \u00b1 \u03b4) \u2212 n(min{S(AB)\u03c8 , S(R)\u03c8 } \u00b1 \u03b4)\n\u2265 n(min{S(B)\u03c8 , S(AR)\u03c8 } \u2212 S(R)\u03c8 \u2212 2\u03b4)\n= n(min{I(ACiB)\u03c8 , I(AiBC)\u03c8 } \u2212 2\u03b4).\n\n(32)\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n\nFor each outcome j, define Xj to be the variable taking the value zero if \u03c8jA B R satisfies\nEq.

Suppose that I(CiB)\u03c8 > 0 and\nn n n\nconsider n copies of the purified state (\u03c8 ABCR )\u2297n , written as \u03c8 C B R1 where R1 := AR is\nthe relative reference for the helper C. State merging [30, 31] tells us that a random measurement on the typical subspace C\u0303, as described in our protocol, will decouple the system\nfrom its relative reference R1n , allowing recovery of C n by Bob up to arbitrarily high fidelity.\nOur assisted distillation protocol can be improved for this case by recovering the C n system\nat Bob's location before engaging into a two-way distillation protocol, which will now act\non the state (\u03c8 AB B\u0303 )\u2297n , where B\u0303 is an ancilla of the same dimension as the C system. Since\nthe distillable entanglement across the cut A vs BC cannot increase by local operations and\nclassical communication, the previous strategy is in fact optimal. A small amount of initial\nentanglement between C n and B n may be needed if I(CiB)\u03c8 = 0 (see [30]).\nThe previous analysis may lead us to believe that when the lower bound of Eq. (30) is\nequal to I(ACiB)\u03c8 , a similar strategy of transferring the system C to Alice could be applied.\nHowever, the following counterexample will show that this is not always true. Let\n1\n1\n1\n|\u03c8iBC2 R = \u221a |000iBC2 R + |110iBC2 R + |111iBC2 R\n2\n2\n2\nq\n1\n|\u03c8iAC1 = |00iAC1 + 34 |11iAC1 .\n2\n\nand\n(37)\n\nAlice and Bob are to perform assisted distillation on n copies of \u03c8 ABC1 C2 = \u03c8 AC1 \u2297 \u03c8 BC2\nwith the help of a single Charlie holding both the C1 and C2 systems. Such a situation could\narise in practice if Alice had a high-quality quantum channel to Charlie but the Charlie's\nchannel to Bob were noisy. The system R would represent the environment of the noisy\nchannel.\nIn this case, L(\u03c8) is equal to I(ACiB)\u03c8 , which is easily calculated to be approximately\n0.40, since I(AiBC)\u03c8 \u2248 0.81 and I(AiB)\u03c8 is negative. For this example, the achievable rate\nof our random coding protocol is therefore at least the rate that could have been obtained\nby a strategy of first transferring the state of the C system to Alice, followed by entanglement distillation between Alice and Bob at the hashing bound rate. However, the coherent\ninformation I(CiA)\u03c8 is negative for the state \u03c8 ABC1 C2 R . By the optimality of state merging,\nthe state transfer from Charlie to Alice cannot be accomplished without the injection of additional entanglement between them. Therefore, the protocol achieves the rate I(ACiB)\u03c8\nwithout performing the Charlie to Alice state transfer.\nThis example also illustrates a general relationship between hierarchical distillation strategies and the random measurement strategy proposed in this chapter. A hierarchical strategy\nfor a state \u03c8 ABC1 C2 = \u03c8 AC1 \u2297 \u03c8 C2 B would consist of first distilling entanglement between A\nand C1 as well as between C2 and B, followed by entanglement swapping to establish ebits\nbetween Alice and Bob. If the first level distillations are performed at the hashing rate, then\nthis strategy will establish min[I(AiC1 )\u03c8 , I(C2 iB)\u03c8 ] ebits between Alice and Bob per copy of\nthe input state. On the other hand, the random measurement strategy will establish at least\nL(\u03c8), which in the case of the example is the minimum of\nI(ACiB)\u03c8 = I(C2 iB)\u03c8 \u2212 S(AC1 )\u03c8 = I(C2 iB)\u03c8 and\n\nI(AiBC)\u03c8 = I(AiC1 )\u03c8 ,\n\n(38)\n\n\f14\n\nAssisted Entanglement Distillation\n\nyielding exactly the same rate as the hierarchical strategy. (The first line uses the fact that\n\u03c8 AC1 is pure.) So, for the random measurement strategy to beat the hierarchical strategy, it\nis necessary that the state not factor into the form \u03c8 AC1 \u2297 \u03c8 C2 B . As an example, consider\nmodifying the state of Eq. (37) by applying a controlled-NOT operation (CNOT) between the\nsystems C1 and C2 held by Charlie:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1 0 0 0\n\uf8ec 0 1 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n(39)\nCN OT = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0 0 0 1 \uf8f8\n0 0 1 0\nA CNOT operation can be used to model phase dampening effects between an input state\n(i.e the C2 system) and its environment (i.e the C1 system). If the control qubit is the system\nC1 and the target qubit is C2 , the previous state transforms to:\n|\u03c6iC1 C2 ABR :=\n\n|00iAC1 |\u03c8i\n2\n\nBC2 R\n\n+\n\nq\n\nAC1\n3\n4 |11i\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n|010i BC2 R |100i BC2 R |101i BC2 R\n\u221a\n+\n+\n. (40)\n2\n2\n2\n\nThe reduced state \u03c6C1 of the C1 system is equal to:\n\u03c6C1 :=\n\n3\n1\n|0ih0|C1 + |1ih1|C1 ,\n4\n4\n\n(41)\n\nand the reduced state \u03c6AC1 of the system AC1 is given by\n\u03c6AC1 :=\n\n1\n3\n|00ih00|AC1 + |11ih11|AC1 .\n4\n4\n\n(42)\n\nHence, the coherent information I(AiC1 )\u03c6 is zero, yielding a null rate for the hierarchical\nstrategy. On the other hand, the quantities I(ACiB)\u03c6 and I(AiBC)\u03c6 are equal to the coherent informations I(ACiB)\u03c8 and I(AiBC)\u03c8 . Thus, the random measurement strategy is\nunaffected by a CNOT \"error\" on Charlie's systems, as opposed to the hierarchical strategy,\nwhich fails to recover from this error.\nFinally, it is easy to determine conditions under which the random measurement strategy for assisted entanglement distillation will yield a higher rate than the hashing bound\nbetween Alice and Bob. As the next result shows, a state \u03c8 ABC is a good candidate for the\nrandom measurement strategy if it does not saturate the strong subadditivity inequality of\nthe von Neumann entropy, and if the C system can be redistributed to Alice and Bob provided they are allowed to perform joint operations on their systems.\nProposition 10 (Beating the Hashing Inequality) For any state \u03c8 ABC , the value of L(\u03c8) is positive and strictly greater than the coherent information I(AiB)\u03c8 if\nI(CiAB)\u03c8 > 0 and S(A|BC)\u03c8 < S(A|B)\u03c8 .\n\n(43)\n\nProof: The inequality S(A|BC)\u03c8 < S(A|B)\u03c8 can be rewritten as\nI(AiBC)\u03c8 > I(AiB)\u03c8 ,\n\n(44)\n\n\fN.

First, we extend the one-shot\nentanglement of assistance DA (Definition 2) to arbitrary multipartite states \u03c8 C1 C2 ...Cm AB ,\nhenceforth written simply as \u03c8 CM AB . The type of protocols involved is depicted in Figure 3.\n\nDefinition 11 For a general multipartite state \u03c8 CM AB , consider POVMs E1 , . . . , Em performed by\n{C1 , C2 , . . . , Cm } respectively which lead to a (possibly mixed) bipartite state \u03c8kAB\nfor POVM\n1 k2 ...km\noutcomes k := k1 k2 . . . km . We define the multipartite entanglement of assistance as\nDA (\u03c8 CM AB ) := sup\n\nX\n\npk D(\u03c8kAB ),\n\n(47)\n\nk\n\nwhere the supremum is taken over the above measurements. The asymptotic multipartite entangle\u221e\n\u221e\nment of assistance DA\n(\u03c8 CM AB ) is obtained by regularization of the above quantity DA\n(\u03c8 CM AB ) =\n1\n\u2297n\nlimn\u2192\u221e n DA (\u03c8 ).\nFor a pure state \u03c8 CM AB , it is immediate that the supremum in the preceding definition is\nattained for POVMs of rank one, leading to an ensemble of pure states {qk , \u03c8kAB }. And so,\n\n\f16\n\nAssisted Entanglement Distillation\n\n\u221e\nDA\n(\u03c8 CM AB ) reduces to the asymptotic multipartite entanglement of assistance [30] for pure\nstates:\n\u221e\nDA\n(\u03c8 CM AB ) = min{S(AT )\u03c8 },\n(48)\nT\n\nwhere the minimum is taken over all bipartite cuts T . (A bipartite cut consists of a partition\nof the helpers C1 , . . . , Cm into a set T and its complement T = {C1 , . . . , Cm }\\T .)\n\u221e\nProposition 12 Let \u03c8 CM AB be an arbitrary multipartite state. The quantity DA\n(\u03c8 CM AB ) is bounded\nfrom above by the following quantity:\n\u221e\nDA\n(\u03c8 CM AB ) \u2264 min D(\u03c8 AT |BT ),\n\n(49)\n\nT\n\nwhere the minimum is over all bipartite cuts T and \u03c8 AT |BT is a bipartite state with Alice holding\nthe systems AT and Bob holding the systems BT .\nProof: Consider any cut T of the helpers {C1 , C2 , . . . , Cm } and suppose Alice (resp. Bob) is\nallowed to perform joint operations on the systems AT (resp. BT ). Any protocol achiev\u221e\ning DA\n(\u03c8 CM AB ) consists of: 1) POVMs on the helpers followed by a transmission of the\noutcomes to Alice and Bob 2) local operations and classical communication between the systems A and B. This kind of protocol is contained in protocols allowing local operations on\nthe systems AT and BT and classical communication between the cut AT vs BT . Since\nthe distillable entanglement across the cut AT vs BT cannot increase under local operations and classical communication, the optimal achievable rate for these protocols is given\nby D(\u03c8 AT |BT ). Since this holds for any cut T of the helpers, we are done.\nDefinition 13 For an arbitrary multipartite state \u03c8 CM AB , we define the minimum cut coherent\ninformation as:\nc\n(50)\nImin\n(\u03c8, A : B) := min I(AT iBT )\u03c8 ,\nT\n\nwhere the minimization is over all bipartite cuts T \u2286 {C1 , C2 , . . . , Cm }.\nTheorem 14 Let \u03c8 CM AB be an arbitrary multipartite state. The asymptotic multipartite entangle\u221e\nment of assistance DA\n(\u03c8 CM AB ) is bounded below by:\n\u221e\nc\nDA\n(\u03c8 CM AB ) \u2265 max{I(AiB)\u03c8 , Imin\n(\u03c8, A : B)}.\n\n(51)\n\nBefore giving a proof of Theorem 14, we need the following lemma, which states that the\nminimum cut coherent information of the original state is preserved, up to a vanishingly\nsmall perturbation, after an helper has finished performing a random measurement on his\nsystem. The arguments needed for demonstrating this lemma are similar to those used\nin [30] to prove Eq. (48).\nLemma 15 Given n copies of a state \u03c8 CM AB , let Cm perform a random measurement on his typical\nsubspace C\u0303m as in Lemma 7. For any \u03b4 > 0 and large enough n, there exists a measurement performed\nn\nC n ...Cm\u22121\nAn B n\n\nby the helper Cm such that, with arbitrarily high probability, the outcome state \u03c8J 1\nsatisfies the following inequality:\nc\nc\nImin\n(\u03c8J , An : B n ) \u2265 n(Imin\n(\u03c8, A : B) \u2212 \u03b4),\n\n(52)\n\n\fN. Dutil and P. Hayden 17\n\nwhere J is the random variable associated with the measurement outcome.\nc\nProof: The minimum cut coherent information Imin\n(\u03c8, A : B) of the state \u03c8 CM AB can be\nrewritten as\n\b\nc\n(53)\nImin\n(\u03c8, A : B) =\nmin\nS(BT )\u03c8 \u2212 S(R)\u03c8 ,\nT \u2286{C1 ,C2 ,...,Cm }\n\nwhere R is the purifying system for the state \u03c8 CM AB .\nLet T be a bipartite cut of the helpers {C1 , C2 , . . . , Cm } such that Cm \u2208\n/ T . We define\nits relative complement as T \u2032 = {C1 , . . . , Cm\u22121 }\\T . For any such cut T , the state \u03c8 CM AB\nand its purifying system R can be regarded as a tripartite system composed of Cm , ART\nand BT \u2032 . Assuming S(ART )\u03c8 and S(BT \u2032 )\u03c8 to be distinct, the helper Cm performs a random measurement on his typical subspace C\u0303m . By Proposition 22 (see Appendix A) and the\nFannes inequality, there exists a measurement for Charlie's system for which the outcome\nn\nC n ...Cm\u22121\nAn B n\n\nstate \u03c8J 1\n\nsatisfies, with arbitrarily high probability:\n\nmin{S(ART )\u03c8 , S(BT \u2032 )\u03c8 } \u2212 \u03b4 \u2032 \u2264\n\n1\nn\nS(B n T \u2032 )\u03c8J \u2264 min{S(ART )\u03c8 , S(BT \u2032 )\u03c8 } + \u03b4 \u2032 ,\nn\n\n(54)\n\nwhere \u03b4 \u2032 can be made arbitrarily small by taking sufficiently large values for n. Hence,\nthe reduced state entropies stay distinct by taking a sufficiently small value of \u03b4 \u2032 . Since\nc\nImin\n(\u03c8J , An : B n ) can be re-expressed as\nc\nImin\n(\u03c8J , An : B n ) =\n\nn\n\nmin\n\nT \u2286{C1 ,C2 ,...,Cm\u22121 }\n\n{S(B n T \u2032 )\u03c8J } \u2212 S(Rn )\u03c8J ,\n\n(55)\n\nn\n\nwe can substitute the lower bound for S(B n T \u2032 )\u03c8J into Eq. (55) and obtain\nc\nImin\n(\u03c8J , An : B n ) \u2265 n min(min{S(ART )\u03c8 , S(BT \u2032 )\u03c8 } \u2212 \u03b4 \u2032 ) \u2212 S(Rn )\u03c8J\nT\n\n= n(min{S(BT \u2032 Cm )\u03c8 , S(BT \u2032 )\u03c8 } \u2212 \u03b4 \u2032 ) \u2212 S(Rn )\u03c8J\nT\n\n= n(min{S(BT )\u03c8 } \u2212 \u03b4 \u2032 ) \u2212 S(Rn )\u03c8J .\nT\n\n(56)\n\nTo finish the proof, the last fact we need concerns the entropy of the purifying system\nR. If we consider the purified state \u03c8 CM ABR as a tripartite system composed of Cm , R and\nABC1 , . . . , Cm\u22121 , we can apply Proposition 22 and obtain, w.h.p:\nS(Rn )\u03c8J = n(min{S(R)\u03c8 , S(C1 , . . . , Cm\u22121 AB)\u03c8 } \u00b1 \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 )\n\u2264 n(S(R)\u03c8 + \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 ),\n\n(57)\n\nwhere \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 can be made arbitrarily small. This tells us that for large values of n, the entropy of\nthe purifying system will not significantly increase as a result of the helper Cm performing a\nmeasurement on his typical subspace C\u0303m . Note that, as in Theorem 8, we can use the union\nbound and Markov's inequality (see Lemma 7) to show the existence of a measurement on\nC\u0303m which produces states such that, w.h.p, Eqs.(54) and (57) are both satisfied. Combining\nthe last equation with Eq. (56) and choosing values for \u03b4 \u2032 , \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 small enough that \u03b4 \u2032 + \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 < \u03b4,\nwe get the desired result.\nProof of Theorem 14: The right hand side of Eq. (51) is just the coherent information when\nm = 0, and is equal to max{I(AiB)\u03c8 , L(\u03c8)} for m = 1. Eq. (51) holds for these base cases\n\n\f18\n\nAssisted Entanglement Distillation\n\nby the hashing inequality and Theorem 8. So, from here on, assume m \u2265 2. Moreover,\n\u221e\nthat DA\n(\u03c8 CM AB ) is at least I(AiB)\u03c8 follows again from the hashing inequality. Hence, we\n\u221e\ncan focus on proving that DA\n(\u03c8 CM AB ) is bounded below by the minimum cut coherent\ninformation.\nBy Lemma 15, there exists a measurement Em for the helper Cm which produces an\nn\nC n ...Cm\u22121\nAn B n\n\noutcome state \u03c8J 1\n\nsatisfying w.h.p. the following inequality:\n\nc\nc\n(\u03c8, A : B) \u2212 \u03b4),\nImin\n(\u03c8J , An : B n ) \u2265 n(Imin\n\n(58)\n\nfor an arbitrary small \u03b4 and sufficiently large n. If we have at our disposal nm copies of the\nstate \u03c8 CM AB and perform the measurement Em for each block of n copies of the state, we\nexpect to obtain approximately nm\u22121 pj copies of the state \u03c8j , with pj being the probability\nof obtaining the state \u03c8j after the measurement Em is performed by Cm .\nFor each block consisting of many copies of the state \u03c8j , we repeat the previous procedure in a recursive manner. We continue this process until all m helpers have performed\nmeasurements on their systems. In the end, Alice and Bob will obtain a number of bipartite\nstates \u03c8JAB\neach satisfying w.h.p.\n1 J2 ...Jm\nm\n\nm\n\nc\nc\n, An : B n ) \u2265 nm (Imin\n(\u03c8, A : B) \u2212 \u03b4 \u2032 ),\nImin\n(\u03c8JAB\n1 J2 ...Jm\n\n(59)\n\nwhere \u03b4 \u2032 can be made arbitrarily small. Observe that the term on the left hand side of the\ninequality is the coherent information I(AiB)\u03c8JABJ ...J , which is bounded above by the dis1 2\nm\n\nm\n\ntillable entanglement D(\u03c8JAB\n). Since DA (\u03c8 n ) is a supremum over all LOCC measure1 J2 ...Jm\nments performed by the helpers, we have\nm\n1\n1\nDA (\u03c8 \u2297(n ) ) \u2265 m\nnm\nn\n\n\u2265\n\n1\nnm\n\nX\n\n)\npj1 j2 ...jm D(\u03c8jAB\n1 j2 ...jm\n\nX\n\npj1 j2 ...jm I(AiB)\u03c8jABj\n\nj1 j2 ...jm\n\nj1 j2 ...jm\n\n1 2 ...jm\n\nc\n\u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)(Imin\n(\u03c8, A : B) \u2212 \u03b4 \u2032 ),\n\n(60)\n\nwhere \u01eb and \u03b4 \u2032 can be both be made arbitrarily small by the arguments of the previous paragraphs. This concludes the proof.\nBefore closing this section, let us say a few words on assisted distillation when the two\nrecipients are separated by a one-dimensional chain of repeater nodes, as depicted in figure\n4. Applying a hierarchical distillation strategy on \u03c8 ABCD will produce ebits at the rate\nR(\u03c8) := min{I(AiC1 )\u03c81 , I(C2 iD1 )\u03c82 , I(D2 iB)\u03c83 }.\n\n(61)\n\nIf we consider the cut T1 := {C} of the helpers C and D, the coherent information\nI(AT1 iBT 1 )\u03c8 can be simplified to\nI(AT1 iBT 1 )\u03c8 = I(C2 iD1 )\u03c82 \u2212 S(AC1 )\u03c81 \u2264 I(C2 iD1 )\u03c82 ,\n\n(62)\n\n\fN.

A 1-dimensional chain with two repeater stations separating the two recipients A and B.\n\nand similarly for the cuts T2 = {CD} and T3 = \u2205, we have\nI(AT2 iBT 2 )\u03c8 = I(D2 iB)\u03c83 \u2212 S(AC1 )\u03c81 \u2212 S(C2 D1 )\u03c82 \u2264 I(D2 iB)\u03c83 ,\n\nI(AT3 iBT 3 )\u03c8 = I(AiC1 )\u03c81 .\n\n(63)\n\nc\nThus, the minimum cut coherent information Imin\n(\u03c8 ABCD , A : B) is not greater than R(\u03c8),\nand so a hierarchical strategy might be better suited for the case of a chain state than a random measurement strategy, provided the information stored in the repeaters is not subject\nto errors (see the example of the previous section). It is easy to generalize the previous arguments to a chain of arbitrary length (i.e m \u2265 3), and to other network configurations.\n\n6 Discussion\nWe generalized the entanglement of assistance problem by allowing the parties to share a\nmultipartite mixed state. For the case of three parties holding a mixed tripartite state, the\noptimal assisted distillation rate was proven to be equal to the regularization of the one-shot\nentanglement of assistance, a quantity which maximizes the average distillable entanglement over all measurements performed by the helper. Two upper bounds for this quantity\nwere established and examples of classes of states attaining them were given. Additionally, the one-shot entanglement of assistance was proven to be a convex quantity for pure\nensembles.\nWe also presented new protocols for assisted entanglement distillation, based on a random coding strategy, which are proven to distill entanglement at a rate no less than the\nminimum cut coherent information, defined as the minimum coherent information over all\npossible bipartite cuts of the helpers. For states not saturating strong subadditivity, and recoverable by Alice and Bob if they can implement joint operations, we proved that our random coding strategy achieves rates surpassing the hashing inequality. Moreover, the rates\nformally resemble those achievable if the helper system were merged to either Alice or Bob\neven when such merging is impossible. Finally, we compared our protocol to a hierarchical\nstrategy in the context of quantum repeaters. We identified a major weakness of the hierarchical strategy by analyzing the effect of a CNOT error on the rates achievable for such\nstrategy. We found that the rate, which can be as good as the rate of our random measurement, becomes null when such error occurs at the repeater node. On the other hand, our\nprotocol is completely fault tolerant and yields the same rate even if this error goes undetected by the helper holding the systems at the repeater node.\nOur proposed protocol for assisted distillation of a general multipartite state, involved a\nmeasurement on a long block of states, and then a measurement on blocks of these blocks,\n\n\f20\n\nAssisted Entanglement Distillation\n\nand so on. It seems likely that a strategy where all the helpers measure in a random basis of\ntheir respective typical subspaces and broadcast the results to Alice and Bob will still yield\na rate attaining at least the minimum cut coherent information. For pure states \u03c8 ABC1 C2 , we\nshow in [32] that such a strategy is indeed possible by introducing a state merging protocol\nwhich acts on a pure multipartite state. However, for a general multipartite state, it is still\nunknown if such a strategy would work.\nWe could extend our assisted entanglement scenario in several ways. For instance, we\ncould consider other forms of pure entanglement such as Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)\nstates and look at the optimal achievable rates under LOCC operations. Another interesting question is to analyze whether general LOCC operations between the parties give more\npower to the helpers. In the pure multipartite case, we saw that such strategy is not required\nto achieve optimal assisted rates. For multipartite mixed state, we should expect a difference\nin achievable rates when allowing more communication freedom to the helpers. We just\nhave to consider bipartite distillation protocols to see this: the hashing protocol is impossible without communication between the parties. Finally another potential line of research\nis to analyze our assisted protocol using smooth min and max entropies. Recent work by\nBuscemi and Datta [33] analyzed the one-way distillable entanglement of a bipartite mixed\nstate \u03c8 AB in the one-shot regime using one-shot entropic quantities similar to the quantum\nmin- and max-entropy of [34]. The entanglement of assistance for pure states \u03c8 ABC was also\nanalyzed under this framework [35], and it is another natural progression of our work to analyze the entanglement of assistance using the quantum min- and max-entropy formalism.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Mark Wilde for his helpful comments.

Let \u03c8 C\u0303 B\u0303 R\u0303 be the normalized state obtained by projecting C n , B n , Rn into their respective\ntypical subspaces C\u0303, B\u0303, R\u0303. Charlie performs a projective measurement using an orthonormal basis\n{|ei iC\u0303 } of C\u0303 chosen at random according to the Haar measure. Denote by pi the probability of\nobtaining outcome i.

The average is taken over the unitary\ngroup U(C\u0303) using the Haar measure.\nProof of Lemma 7: The proof of this statement is obtained by combining Proposition 22\nwith Markov's inequality and Boole's inequality (the union bound). For any \u03be1 > 0 and\n\u03be2 > 0, consider a projective measurement of Charlie with rank one projectors U |iihi|U \u2020 and\nlet J be the measurement outcome.
