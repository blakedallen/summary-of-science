Isolated defects in insulators often produce magnetic moments,\nwhich occur anytime a state in the band gap is occupied by an odd number of electrons. A common\nexample is the P impurity in Si, where the magnetism of the material evolves with increased doping as the insulator-metal transition is approached.\nSuch strictly localized states in insulators are magnetic regardless of their underlying atomic character\nor their degree of localization.\nElfimov et al.2 proposed to use the cation vacancy\n\u2013 the charge conjugate of the conventional F-center\nstate \u2013 in non-magnetic oxides such as CaO3 as a\nsource of magnetic moment in insulators. The resulting pair of holes, which are bound to the region\nfor an isolated vacancy, may form a magnetic center even if it does not lie in the gap, due to the\nlarge Hund's coupling on the oxygen ions neighboring the vacancy (which can no longer be simple\nnon-magnetic O2\u2212 ). These states extend to a few\natomic neighbors, with magnetic coupling resulting\nfrom direct exchange. Magnetic order becomes possible, and at concentrations of a few percent they\nsuggested that conduction, and half metallic ferromagnetism, might result.\nThe Osaka group4 followed by suggesting that\nB, C, or N substituted for O in CaO could result\nin local moments in the 2p states of the impurity\nions. The coupling between moments was found, in\ncalculations on random alloys, to be FM and halfmetallic ferromagnetism was also predicted, possibly\n\nas high as room temperature. Elfimov et al.5 studied the specific case of N substituting for O in SrO,\napplying not only the conventional local spin density approximation (LSDA) but also the stronglycorrelated form (LSDA+U) that should be appropriate for localized magnetic states. They also obtained the possibility of half metallic ferromagnetism\nat technologically relevant temperatures. Experimentally, magnetism has been observed as a surface\neffect in thin films of these non-magnetic oxides.6\nTABLE I: Lattice parameters7 and band gap8 of the corresponding monoxides under study.\nCompound Lattice parameter (\u00c5) Band gap (eV)\nMgO\n4.12\n7.2\nCaO\n4.81\n6.2\nSrO\n5.16\n5.3\nBaO\n5.52\n4.0\n\nThere are other examples of atomic p character giving rise to magnetism in solids. One example is the class of alkali hyperoxides (for example, RbO2 9,10 and Rb4 O6 11,12 ). These materials are\nionic, containing the spin-half O1\u2212\n2 ion, and display\na variety of unusual magnetism-related properties.\nThe SrN2 compound, an ionic material containing\n13\nthe N2\u2212\nwhile the SrN\n2 unit, is a related example,\ncompound with magnetic N is predicted to be a\nhalf metallic ferromagnet.14 Between the bulk compounds and the (nearly) isolated magnetic impurities, another promising example has been reported.\nAt the p-type interface between LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 ,\nthere is (from simple electron counting) 0.5 too few\nelectrons per interface cell to fill all of the O 2p\nstates that are filled in both bulk materials. Holes\nmush exist in the O 2p bands at the interface, and\n\n\fPentcheva and Pickett predicted that magnetic holes\narise and should order at low temperature.15 Subsequently, magnetic hysteresis has been observed at\nthis interface.16\nHere we will analyze the magnetism and magnetic\ncoupling in alkaline-earth monoxides doped with N\nin more detail. Substitution of O by N in an insulating host presents a clear platform for local moments,\nand the basic picture is simple. Besides changing the\npotential locally, the substitution of O by N removes\none electron giving a N\u22122 2p5 ion, and thereby introduces a hole that is necessarily magnetic (being\nspin-uncompensated). Ferromagnetism may result\nif the magnetic coupling has the right character and\nis sufficiently robust. Within the series MgO, CaO,\nSrO and BaO the volume varies by a factor of 2.3\nand the bandgap varies by over a factor of 1.8, see\nTable I. By introducing dopant nitrogen atoms with\nconcentrations of one N atom per 8, 16 and 32 O\natoms, we are able to model impurity concentrations\nof 12.5%, 6% and 3%, respectively. The goal here is\nto understand the electronic structure and magnetic\ncharacter of the substitutional N impurity, to study\ndopant interactions for the various concentrations,\nand to analyze the magnetic properties by calculating the condition for strong coupling that could lead\nto a FM Tc on the order of room temperature.\nThese semiconductors crystallize in a rocksalt\nstructure. Upon increasing the lattice parameter\nby introducing a bigger cation, there should be a\ntendency for the N hole state to become more localized. However, the band gap narrows in proceeding\nfrom the smallest to largest (7.2 eV for MgO, 4.0 for\nBaO), a trend that should cause a corresponding increase in the tendency towards delocalization of the\nimpurity state. How these effects compete is important to determine. Another distinction is that the\nlowest conduction states in CaO, SrO, and BaO are\nd states, while MgO is very different in this regard\n(Mg s, O 3s, 3p). The hole state will be formed from\nvalence orbitals, however, so the impact both of the\nmagnitude of the band gap and the character of the\nconduction band must be calculated.\nTable II summarizes the N-N nearest neighbor\ndistances in the different compounds for the various concentrations considered. As the concentration\nchanges, the coordination of the impurities varies, as\nis provided in the table.\n\nII.\n\nTABLE II: Nearest neighbors distances and number of\nnearest neighbors for the impurity at various concentrations and monoxides under study.\nCompound Concentration N-N distance (\u00c5)\n(no. neighbors)\nMgO\n1/8\n6.0 (12)\nMgO\n1/16\n6.0 (4)\nMgO\n1/32\n8.4 (6)\nCaO\n1/16\n6.8 (4)\nSrO\n1/8\n7.3 (12)\nSrO\n1/16\n7.3 (4)\nSrO\n1/32\n10.3 (6)\nBaO\n1/8\n7.8 (12)\nBaO\n1/16\n7.8 (4)\nBaO\n1/32\n11.0 (6)\n\nSham equations. This method uses an all-electron,\nfull-potential scheme that makes no shape approximation to the potential or the electron density. The exchange-correlation potential utilized was\nthe Wu-Cohen version of the generalized gradient\napproximation20 and strong correlation effects were\nintroduced by means of the LSDA+U scheme21 including an on-site effective U for the O and N p\nstates. We have used option nldau= 1 in wien2k,\ni.e. the so-called \"fully-localized limit\", using an effective Uef f = U-J, being J the on-site Hund's rule\ncoupling constant, taken as J= 0. The justification\nof utilizing the LSDA+U scheme comes from spectroscopic measurements in oxides, which estimate\nlarge values of U (5-7 eV) for the p states.22 This\nhas been shown to be crucial in understanding the\ninterfacial electronic structure of transtion metal oxides, where magnetic moments can localize in the O\natoms.15 All the calculations were converged with\nrespect to all the parameters used, to the precision\nnecessary to support our calculations.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe begin by studying the local electronic structure of a N 2p5 impurity in MgO. Comparing a nonmagnetic solution for the N atom and a solution with\n1 \u03bcB /N (a local moment formation in the N site),\nthe total energy difference favors the magnetic solution by more than 100 meV/N, a value that is nearly\nindependent of the concentration of impurities. The\nintroduction of a value of Uef f = 5 eV produces a\nfurther stabilization of the magnetic solution with\nrespect to the non-magnetic one (the energy difference rises above 300 meV/N).\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL DETAILS\n\nElectronic structure calculations were performed\nwithin density functional theory17 using wien2k,18\nwhich utilizes an augmented plane wave plus local\norbitals (APW+lo)19 method to solve the Kohn2\n\n\f50\n\nBa16O15N\n\n25\n\nDOS (states/(eV spin))\n\n0\n50\n\nSr16O15N\n\n25\n0\n50\n\nCa16O15N\n\n25\n0\n50\n\nMg16O15N\n\n25\n0\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\nFIG. 2: Total density of states of the various monoxides under study for FM alignment, calculated with the\nLSDA+U method for U= 5.5 eV. Only the minority spin\nchannel is shown, since it illustrates all the important\nfeatures: O 2p bandwidth, narrowing of the bandgap,\nand the position of the hole state at 2-2.5 eV above the\nvalence band maximum..\n\nFIG. 1: Total density of states for ferromagnetically\naligned MgO1\u2212x Nx with x= 1/16 \u2248 6%, calculated with\nthe LSDA+U method including spin-orbit effects using\nU= 5.5 eV for the 2p-states of both N and O. The majority DOS is plotted upward, the minority is plotted\ndownward.\n\nA.\n\nthe N impurities are as regularly distributed as possible (their separation is maximized). As mentioned\nabove, one can imagine how the physics can change\nfrom MgO to BaO as the size of the cation, and the\nvolume, increases. On one hand, greater delocalization is permitted as the band gap is reduced (by a\nfactor 2 experimentally, by a factor 3 from our calculations for the doped compounds with Uef f = 5.5\neV). On the other hand, for a given concentration of\nimpurities, the N-N distance becomes larger for the\nlarger volume compounds. The former could encourage an easier propagation of the magnetic coupling\nthroughout the crystal, while the latter would imply a smaller magnetic interaction if the size of the\ndefect state remains the same.\nWe first consider the Uef f = 5.5 eV electronic\nstructure for a particular case, MgO with x= 1/16 \u223c\n6%, where the density of states (DOS) for separate\nspin directions is shown in Fig. 1. For the minority\nspin, the narrow hole band lies in the gap and has a\nfull bandwidth of W \u2248 0.3 eV. The other two N 2p\nminority states are occupied and lie above the O 2p\nbands. The separation of filled and unfilled minority\nN states is 2 eV, being the Hund's exchange about\n0.6 eV in the occupied N p states. The conduction\nbands show no appreciable spin splitting. When we\ninclude spin-orbit coupling, the hole occupies the px\n- i py state, lz = -1 orbital, satisfying Hund's rule.\nTo display the trends across the series, it is sufficient to look only at the minority DOS, which is\nplotted for each compound in Fig. 2. The band\ngap reduction through the series Mg\u2192Ba is evident.\nThe O 2p bandwidth is much larger for MgO but\nthis has little effect on the defect state, except per-\n\nEffect of atomic relaxation\n\nSubstitutional N in these monoxides will break the\nsymmetry and may lead to some local distortion of\nthe otherwise perfectly octahedral environment of\nthe cation. To determine the importance of atomic\nrelaxation we performed structural minimization for\nMgO1\u2212x Nx , with x= 1/16. If sufficiently localized,\nthe hole might occupy a pz orbital (lz = 0), leading to\nan elongation of the N-Mg distance along the z axis,\nor it could be px \u00b1ipy (lz = \u00b1 1) that is unoccupied,\nleading to an elongation of the N-Mg distance in the\nplane perpendicular to the z axis. The symmetric\nLSDA solution shares the hole among the p orbitals\nequally. We have performed a structural optimization within GGA (i.e. without including strong correlation effects) which leads to an electron density\ndescribing the hole in the N atom being symmetric. The result is that Mg-N distances get modified\nonly slightly, becoming elongated by less than 0.5%.\nAlso, using the LSDA+U scheme for doing the structure optimization, the hole located in a pz state leads\nto an elongation of about 3% of the Mg-N distance\nalong the z-axis. We have found that these small\ndifferences have little effect on the trends we study,\neither the localization of the magnetic moment or\nthe magnetic coupling, hence we have neglected relaxation in the results that follow.\nB.\n\nElectronic and Magnetic Trends\n\nWe have treated the N concentrations listed in Table II. For each concentration, we have assumed that\n3\n\n\fhaps contributing a small additional broadening. In\nspite of this large band gap variation, and the change\nin the volume (hence the near neighbor distance)\nthe position of the unoccupied hole state changes\nrather little, staying 2\u00b10.5 eV above the highest occupied state. The variation that does occur is nonmonotonic and may be due to the conduction bands\nthat fall in energy through the series. For BaO, narrowest band gap member, the N hole band merges\ninto the bottom of the conduction Ba d bands.\nBecause the intra-atomic Coulomb interaction\nstrength U is at least a few eV, these systems are\nin the regime U/W >> 1 (being W the N 2p hole\nbandwidth) so hopping of the holes will be inhibited, giving insulating behavior. This is the limit in\nwhich the LSDA+U method works well. For values\nof U bigger than \u223c1 eV, the material is insulating\nwhereas for smaller values (i.e. in LSDA or GGA),\nthe N hole band intersects the upper valence bands\nand the band structure becomes metallic (or halfmetallic).\nC.\n\nTABLE III: Strength of the magnetic coupling converted\ninto Curie temperature of the corresponding monoxides\nunder study obtained from an LSDA calculation (including spin-orbit effects) and a GGA (Wu-Cohen) calculation (U= 0).\nCompound Concentration\nMgO\nMgO\nMgO\nCaO\nSrO\nSrO\nSrO\nBaO\nBaO\nBaO\n\nare insulating with no means to transfer magnetic\ncoupling except classical dipolar coupling. For MgO\nat the higher concentrations (x=1/8 and x= 1/16),\nthe magnetic coupling is much higher than for the\nother compounds, because of the much smaller lattice parameter, and the introduction of U reduces\nthe size of the interaction but does not kill Tc .\nPutting all these LSDA data together, we can\nmake a plot of how the magnetic interaction strength\nJ varies in these compounds with respect to the N-N\ndistance, neglecting all the differences between the\nvarious compounds we are considering. The result\ncan be seen in Figure 3, that shows an exponentiallike decay in the strength of the magnetic coupling\nas the N impurity atoms are separated. There is, remarkably, an upturn for N-N distances above 10 \u00c5,\nwith values above room temperature for BaO and\nSrO for a concentration around x \u223c 3%. For this\nsupercell, the magnetic impurities are located on a\nsimple cubic sublattice at lattice constant 2a. Elfimov et al.5 have shown that the electronic coupling\nbetween N impurities in SrO is highly directional,\nwith strong coupling along the crystalline axes (large\neffective px -px coupling along the x-axis, for example). This opens the possibility of reaching high temperature FM attainable concentrations of N dopant\nin the limit U\u223c W.\nA double-exchange-like microscopic mechanism\nseems to be the best explanation of the FM coupling in these monoxides in the GGA limit, when\nthe Fermi level lies within the impurity band. Double exchange is normally associated with carriers\ncoupled to a background of moments, with kinetic energy favored by alignment of the moments.\nElectronic structure-wise, the added kinetic energy\nshows up as an increased bandwidth compared to\n\nSign, strength, and character of magnetic\ncoupling\n\nSince the N ions form a strong local magnetic moment, the next question is whether they couple ferromagnetically and what the strength of the magnetic interaction is. We have performed calculations on both FM and antiferromagnetic (AF) alignments to obtain the coupling between nearest neighbor N moments, for the different concentrations and\nmonoxides under study. We estimate the Curie temperature by using the mean field expression\nfrom a\nP\nHeisenberg model of the type H= Jij Si Sj , with\nS=1/2 (the sum is over pairs),\nTc =\n\n2zS(S + 1)J\n,\n3kB\n\n1/8\n1/16\n1/32\n1/16\n1/8\n1/16\n1/32\n1/8\n1/16\n1/32\n\nTc (K)\nTc (K)\n[LSDA+SO] [GGA]\n330\n320\n400\n400\n5\n70\n72\n83\n82\n66\n31\n41\n250\n98\n32\n31\n11\n13\n280\n230\n\n(1)\n\nwhere z is the number of nearest neighbors and J is\nthe exchange constant.\nTable III shows how the magnetic coupling between N moments varies both with the concentration and the different compound considered. The\ndata presented in the table were obtained for a calculation without considering strong correlation effects\n(U= 0), but including spin-orbit effects, and also\nusing the Wu-Cohen GGA functional. The effect\nof introducing U is to reduce the magnetic coupling,\nbecause it further localizes the moments. In fact, using a range of values of U up to 8 eV, we find that, for\nBaO and SrO, the introduction of U as small as 1.5\neV leads to magnetic coupling too small to determine\nreliably from supercell energy differences. The hole\nstates no longer overlap directly, and the materials\n4\n\n\fcalculated the coupling for a variety of concentrations, paying particular attention to the effect of\n\nantialignment. Indeed for the GGA calculations and\nfor small values of U, the system is (half) metallic\nand the double exchange picture as conventionally\ninterpreted makes sense. As U is increased beyond\n\u223c1 eV, a gap appears, and in the large U regime\nthe coupling is certain to be via direct exchange.\nHowever, as shown in Fig. 3, the coupling strength\n(as reflected in Tc in this figure) does not appear\nto undergo any discontinuity at the metal-insulator\ntransition. The coupling (and Tc ) does however decrease rapidly as the value of U is increased. Having\nband states at the Fermi level leads also to a larger\nFM coupling. When U > Ucr = 1 eV is introduced\nin the calculations, an insulating state is obtained\nand magnetic exchange coupling is reduced (see Fig.\n4).\n\n450\n400\n350\n300\n\nx= 1/16\nx= 1/8\n\nTc (K)\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nU (eV)\n\nFIG. 4: Strength of the magnetic coupling in MgO obtained from an LSDA+U calculation (including spinorbit coupling) with various values of U calculated in\nterms of the Curie temperature.\n\nHubbard repulsion U (since U > W for these systems, where W is the impurity band width). The\nlocal moments that form, mainly confined to the N\natoms and their nearest neighbors, would lead to\nroom temperature ferromagnetism in the itinerant\nelectron limit via a double-exchange-like exchange\ncoupling within the impurity band. However, in\nthe more realistic localized electron limit U >> W\nthe coupling must be due to direct exchange (local impurity state overlap) and becomes drastically\nreduced. Interestingly, the crossover between the\ndouble-exchange coupling and the direct exchange\nas the interaction strength is increased does not\nlead to any discernible anomaly in magnetic coupling strength at the metal-insulator transition. Finally, we confirm that the impurity state is highly\nanisotropic, and as result magnetic coupling is enhanced by ordering of the magnetic N impurities on\na periodic (simple cubic) sublattice.\n\nFIG. 3: Exchange coupling strength with respect to the\nN-N distance, considering all the LSDA data from the\nvarious compounds together. \"Error\" bars simply denote\nthe range of values that were calculated for the same near\nneighbor distance, see Table II.\n\nIn Fig. 4 we illustrate more explicitly how the\neffect of U reduces the Curie temperature. Strong\ncorrelation effects produce a stronger localization of\nthe magnetic moments, i.e. their effects extend to\nfewer neighbors. The reduced separation of overlap\nleads to a corresponding reduction of the magnetic\ninteraction. Hence, in the limit U >> W, where this\nsystem resides for the concentrations we study, the\nmagnetic coupling will not be strong.\nIV.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe have benefited from discussion on this topic\nwith S.
