The data point to a large ss\u0304 component in the f0 (980):\n3\n40% <\n\u223c ss\u0304 <\n\u223c 70%. Nearly 30% of the 1 P0 ss\u0304 component flows to the mass\nregion 1300\u20131500 MeV being shared by f0 (1300), f0 (1500) and broad state\nf0 (1200 \u2212 1600): the interference of these states results in a peak near 1400\nMeV with the width around 200 MeV.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe meson yields in the decay Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [1] evoked immediately a great\ninterest and now they are actively discussed (see [2, 3, 4, 5] and references therein).\nThe matter is that in this decay the production of strange quarkonium is dominant,\nDs+ \u2192 \u03c0 + ss\u0304, with a subsequent transition ss\u0304 \u2192 fJ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . Therefore, the reaction\nDs+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 may serve us as a tool for the estimation of ss\u0304 components in the fJ\nmesons. This possibility is particularly important in context of the determination\nof quark content of the f0 mesons, for the classification of q q\u0304 scalar-isoscalar states\nis a key problem in the search for exotics.\nIn the Ds+ decay the production of f0 mesons proceeds mainly via spectator\nmechanism, Fig. 1a: this very mechanism implements the transition ss\u0304 \u2192 f0 . Besides, the spectator mechanism provides a strong production of the \u03c6(1020) meson.\nTo evaluate the ss\u0304 components in f0 mesons, we use the process Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c6(1020)\nas a standard: we consider the ratio Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + f0 /Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c6(1020), where the\nuncertainty related to the coupling c \u2192 \u03c0 + s is absent.\nCalculation of the transition of Fig. 1a is performed in the spectral integration\ntechnique, this technique was intensively used for the study of weak decays of D\n1\n\n\fand B mesons, see [6] and references therein. The cuttings of the triangle diagram\nrelated to the double spectral integrals are shown in Fig. 1b.\nIn addition, the \u03c0 + f0 production can originate from the W -annihilation process\nof Figs. 1c,d. It is a relatively weak transition, nevertheless we take it into account,\nand the reaction Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c10 serves us as a scale to determine the W -annihilation\ncoupling cs\u0304 \u2192 ud\u0304. Let us emphasize that the processes shown in Fig. 1 are of the\nleading order in terms of the 1/Nc expansion rule.\nIn Section 2 we present the data set used for the analysis and write down the\namplitudes for the spectator and W -annihilation processes. The results of calculations are presented and discussed in Section 3. In this Section we demonstrate that\n(i) the W -annihilation contributes weakly to the fJ -meson production, and (ii) the\n13 P0 -state dominates the transition ss\u0304 \u2192 f0 , while the production of the 23 P0 ss\u0304component is relatively suppressed, so the transition Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + ss\u0304 \u2192 \u03c0 + f0 is in fact\na measure for the 13 P0 ss\u0304-component in scalar\u2013isoscalar mesons.\nIn Conclusion we sum up what the data on the decay Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 tell us, in\nparticular with respect to the identification of the lightest scalar q q\u0304 nonet.\n\n2\n\nData set and the amplitudes for the spectator\nand W -annihilation mechanisms\n\nIn this Section we present the data used in the analysis and write formulae for the\nspectator and W -annihilation mechanisms , Fig. 1a and Figs. 1c,d, respectively.\n\n2.1\n\nThe data set\n\nIn the recently measured spectra from the reaction Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [1], the relative\nweight of channels \u03c0 + f0 (980) and \u03c0 + \u03c10 (770) is evaluated,\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nBR \u03c0 + f0 (980) = 57% \u00b1 9%,\n\n\u0011\n\nBR \u03c0 + \u03c10 (770) = 6% \u00b1 6% ,\n\n(1)\n\nand the ratio of yields,\n\u0393(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )/\u0393(Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c6(1020)) = 0.245 \u00b1 0.028+0.019\n\u22120.012\n\n(2)\n\nis measured. These values are the basis to determine relative weight of the ss\u0304\ncomponent in the f0 (980).\nBesides, in ref. [1] the bump in the wave (IJ P C = 00++ ) is seen at 1434 \u00b1 18\nMeV with the width 173 \u00b1 32 MeV; this should be a contribution from the nearly\nlocated resonances f0 (1300), f0 (1500) and the broad state f0 (1200 \u2212 1600). Relative\nweight of this bump is equal to:\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nBR \u03c0 + (f0 (1300) + f0 (1500) + f0 (1200 \u2212 1600)) = 26% \u00b1 11% .\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\fThis magnitude allows us to determine the total weight of the 13 P0 ss\u0304 component in\nthe states f0 (1300), f0 (1500), f0 (1200 \u2212 1600).\n\nNow the data of FOCUS collaboration [7] on the decay Ds \u2192 \u03c0 + f0 (980) are\navailable. These data are compatible with those of [1], so we do not use them in our\nestimates, and we base on the ratios \u03c0 + f0 /\u03c0 + \u03c6 measured in [1].\n\nIn addition, the production of f2 (1270) is seen in [1]: BR (\u03c0 + f2 (1270)) = 20% \u00b1\n4% that makes it necessary to include tensor mesons into the calculation machinery.\n\n2.2\n\nDecay amplitudes and partial widths\n\nThe spin structure of the amplitude depends on the type of the produced meson -\nit is different for scalar (f0 ), vector (\u03c6, \u03c9, \u03c1) or tensor (f2 ) mesons.

The transition ss\u0304 \u2192 meson is a\ncharacteristic feature of the spectator mechanism, it contributes to the production\nof isoscalar mesons: Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + f0 , \u03c0 + f2 , \u03c0 + \u03c6, \u03c0 + \u03c9, whereas \u03c10 cannot be produced\nwithin spectator mechanism. The W -annihilation contributes to the production of\nmesons with both I = 1 and I = 0, Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + f0 , \u03c0 + f2 , \u03c0 + \u03c6, \u03c0 + \u03c9 and Ds \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c10 .\nTherefore, the latter reaction, Ds \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c10 , allows us to evaluate relative weight\nof the effective coupling constant for W -annihilation, thus giving a possibility to\nestimate the W -annihilation contribution to the channels of interest: Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + f0 ,\n\u03c0 + f2 , \u03c0 + \u03c6. This estimate tells us that the W -annihilation is relatively weak that\nagrees with conventional evaluations, see, for example, [6].\nThe amplitudes for the spectator production of mesons (Fig. 1a) and for W annihilation (Figs. 1c,d) can be calculated in terms of double spectral integral\nrepresentation developed for the quark three-point diagrams in [6, 8]. The calculation scheme for the diagram of Fig. 1a in the spectral integration technique is\nas follows. We consider the relevant energy-off-shell diagram shown in Fig. 1b\nfor which the momentum of the cs\u0304 system, P = k1 + k2 , obeys the requirement\nP 2 \u2261 s > (mc + ms )2 , while the ss\u0304 system, with the momentum P \u2032 = k1\u2032 + k2 ,\nsatisfies the constraint P \u20322 \u2261 s\u2032 > 4m2s , here ms,c are the masses of the constituent\ns, c quarks which are taken to be ms = 500 MeV and mc = 1500 MeV. The next step\nconsists in the calculation of double discontinuity of the triangle diagram (cuttings I\nand II in Fig. 1b) which correspond to real processes, and the double discontinuity\nis the integrand of double dispersion representation.\nThe double dispersion integrals may be rewritten in terms of the light-cone variables, by introducing the light-cone wave functions for the Ds+ -meson and produced\nmesons f0 , f2 , \u03c6, \u03c9, \u03c10 : the calculations performed here are done by using these\nvariables.\nOur calculations have been carried out in the limit of negligibly small pion mass,\nm\u03c0 \u2192 0, that is a reasonable approach, for in the ratio Ds \u2192 \u03c0 + fJ /Ds \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c6 the\nuncertainties related to this limit are mainly cancelled.\n\n4\n\n\f2.3.1\n\nSpectator-production form factor\n\nThe form factor for the spectator process given by the triangle diagram of Fig. 1a\nreads:\n(spectator) 2\nFM\n(q )\n\n1\nZ\ndx\nGspectator Z\nd2 k\u22a5 \u03c8Ds (s)\u03c8M (s\u2032 )SDs \u2192\u03c0M (s, s\u2032 , q 2 ) .

As a result, the convolution of wave\nfunctions \u03c8Ds \u2297 \u03c8M (rad. excit.) occurred to be considerably less than the convolution\n\u03c8Ds \u2297 \u03c8M .\n\nSo, the production of the radial-excitation state Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + (23 P0 ss\u0304) is relativelly\nsuppressed, by the factor of the order of 1/30. This means that by measuring f0 resonances one measures actually the yield of the 13 P0 ss\u0304 state.\n\n3.4\n\nThe decay Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + f0(980)\n\nThe channel Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + f0 (980) dominates the decay Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , it comprises\n57% \u00b1 9%.

The\nconstraint (29) shows that the Ds+ -meson decay prefers the solution with negative\nmixing angle, thus supporting the f0 (980) to be dominantly flavour-octet state. The\nanalysis of hadronic spectra in terms of the K-matrix approach [11, 12] also points\nto the flavour-octet origin of the f0 (980).\n\n3.5\n\nThe decay Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + f2(1270)\n\nTaking into account BR[f2 (1270) \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ] \u2243 57%, one has\n\u03c0 + f2 (1270)\n= 0.09(1 \u00b1 0.2) .\n\u03c0 + \u03c6(1020)\n\n(30)\n\n2\n\u2243\nThe values of \u03c6T , which satisfy the ratio (30), are shown in Fig. 3b.

The following parameters\nwere used in the calculation of the transitions Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + 13 P0 ss\u0304 \u2192 \u03c0 + (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )S :\n(1) \u03c6[f0 (1300)] = \u22127\u25e6 , \u03c6[f0 (1500)] = 7\u25e6 , \u03c6[f0 (1200 \u2212 1600)] = 37\u25e6 ,\n(2) \u03c6[f0 (1300)] = \u221225\u25e6 , \u03c6[f0 (1500)] = 17\u25e6 , \u03c6[f0 (1200 \u2212 1600)] = 37\u25e6 ,\n(3) \u03c6[f0 (1300)] = 17\u25e6 , \u03c6[f0 (1500)] = 17\u25e6 , \u03c6[f0 (1200 \u2212 1600)] = 37\u25e6 . (35)\nThe variants (1) and (2) in Fig. 4a reproduce well the bump observed in the Ds+ \u2192\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay: the relative weight of the bump for variants (1), (2) is of the order\nof \u223c 15% \u00f7 20% that agrees with measured weight of the peak [1]. The variant (3)\ndemonstrates that with the same signs of mixing angles for f0 (1300) and f0 (1500)\nthe calculated curve gives a dip, not bump, near 1400 MeV.\nIn Fig. 4 one can also see the results of the calculation performed for the radial excitation state 23 P0 ss\u0304 (curves (4), (5)). For transitions Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + 23 P0 ss\u0304 \u2192\n\u03c0 + (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )S the following angles are used:\n(4)\n(5)\n\n\u03c6rad. excit.

[f0 (1200 \u2212 1600)] = 37\u25e6 .\n\n(36)\n\nThese curves illustrate well the suppression rate of the production of the 23 P0 ss\u0304 in\nthe decay Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 .\n\nThe decay Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 was discussed in [3, 4, 5] from the point of view of\ndetermination of the quark structure of the resonances produced - let us stress the\ndifferences in the obtained results. In the paper [5] the hypothesis of the four-quark\nstructure of f0 (980) is advocated: to explain a large yield of f0 (980) within the fourquark model one needs to assume that the decay Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 goes with a strong\n11\n\n\fviolation of the 1/Nc expansion rules. Recall that in terms of the 1/Nc expansion\nthe processes shown in Fig. 1a,c,d dominate; it is not clear why these rules, though\nworking well in other decay processes, are violated in Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . From the\npoint of view of Ref. [5], the yield of ss\u0304 state is seen only at larger masses, such as\nthe 1400-MeV bump or higher.\nIn papers [3, 4] the spectator mechanism shown in Fig. 1a is considered as a\ndominant one: the authors conclude that ss\u0304 component dominates the resonance\nf0 (980) - here our conclusions are similar. However, the interpretation of the bump\naround 1430 MeV differs from ours. Our calculations show that the production of\n23 P0 ss\u0304 component is suppressed, so the bump at 1430 is a manifestation of the 13 P0 ss\u0304\ncomponent, while it was stated in [3, 4] that the component 23 P0 ss\u0304 is responsible\nfor this bump.\nLet us emphasize again that, according to our calculations, relative suppression\nof the production of 23 P0 ss\u0304 component is due to the use of realistic wave functions\nof radial-excitation states, see (26): the existence of a zero in the wave function\nresults in a suppression of the convolution \u03c8Ds \u2297 \u03c823 P0 ss\u0304 .\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nThe performed calculations allow one to trace out the destiny of the ss\u0304 component\nin the dominating process Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + + ss\u0304 \u2192 \u03c0 + + f0 of Fig. 1a. We show that\nthis transition is realized mainly due to the 13 P0 ss\u0304 state while the production of\nradial-excitation state, 23 P0 ss\u0304, is suppressed by factor 1/30 or more. Therefore, the\nreaction Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + + f0 is a measure of the 13 P0 ss\u0304 component in the f0 mesons.\n\nThe data of Ref. [1] tell us that 13 P0 ss\u0304 is dispersed as follows: about 2/3\nof this state is hold by the f0 (980) and the last 1/3 is shared between the states\nwith masses in the region 1300\u20131500 MeV which are f0 (1300), f0 (1500) and broad\nstate f0 (1200 \u2212 1600). This result is quite recognizable as concern the percentage\nof the f0 -states produced in the decay Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 : BR (\u03c0 + f0 (980)) = 57% \u00b1\n9% and BR (\u03c0 + f0 (bump at 1430 MeV )) = 26% \u00b1 11%. The performed calculations\ndemonstrate that nothing prevents this straightforward interpretation. In other\nwords,\n(i) the spectator mechanism Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + + ss\u0304 \u2192 \u03c0 + + f0 dominates,\n(ii) the production of the 23 P0 states is suppressed, and\n(iii) the interference of the states f0 (1300), f0 (1500), f0 (1200 \u2212 1600) may organize\na bump with the mass \u223c 1400 MeV and width \u223c 200 MeV.\n\nThe data [1] cannot provide us with more scrupulous information about the\nweight of 13 P0 ss\u0304 component in the resonances f0 (1300), f0 (1500) and f0 (1750) and\nthe broad state f0 (1400 \u2212 1600). To get such information, one needs to carry out\na combined analysis of the decay Ds+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and hadron reactions with the\nproduction of investigated resonances. The performed investigation of the reaction\n12\n\n\fDs+ \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 is quite in line with the K-matrix analysis of hadronic reactions\n[11, 12, 13] that tells us that in scalar\u2013isoscalar sector the lowest 13 P0 q q\u0304 state is the\nflavour octet while the flavour singlet is a heavier one.\nThe authors thank A.V.
