The total masses and abundance properties of halo gas infalling\nonto disks and the timescales of gas infall have been considered to be key determinants\nwhich can control galaxy evolution processes (e.g., Sellwood & Carlberg 1984), in particular,\nchemical evolution of disk galaxies (e.g., Chiappini et al. 1997). Although it remains largely\nunclear both observationally and theoretically how halo gas can be accreted gradually onto\ndisks, the gradual infall of halo gas is one of key ingredients in most chemical evolution\nmodels that successfully explain their chemical properties (e.g., Matteucci & Fran\u00e7ois 1989).\nIt is well established that there are significantly metal-rich disk stars with [Fe/H]\u223c +0.4\nin the solar neighborhood (e.g., Feltzing & Gustafsson 1998; Bensby et al. 2005). Recent\nobservational and theoretical studies have suggested that the canonical models of the Galactic\nchemical evolution based on infall of metal-poor halo gas have a serious problem in explaining\nthe observed presence of metal-rich stars with [Fe/H] = +0.2\u22120.4 (e.g., Tsujimoto 2007).\nOne of possible ideas to solve this problem is that the Galactic disk experienced accretion of\nmetal-rich gas which originated from the bulge: the observed rather metal-rich disk stars in\nthe solar neighborhood were formed from gas ejected from the bulge (Tsujimoto 2007). It\nis, however, totally unclear whether the gas ejected from the Galactic bulge can really reach\nthe solar-neighborhood under hydrodynamical influences of the gaseous halo owing to lack\nof extensive numerical studies on dynamical fates of the ejected bulge gas.\nThe purpose of this Letter is thus to show, for the first time, how gaseous halos of\ndisk galaxies influence metal-rich stellar winds from the bulges through nuclear activity\n(i.e., starbursts and AGN). We numerically investigate whether and how stellar winds from\nbulges (or stellar ejecta due to supernova feedback) can be accreted onto the disks after\nhydrodynamical interaction between the ejecta and the gaseous halos. This investigation is\nimportant, not only because recent observational studies have found evidence of large-scale\noutflow from bulges in the Galaxy and other disk galaxies (e.g., Bland-Hawthorn & Cohen\n2003; Matthews & Grijs 2004; Veilleux et al. 2005), but also because the physical role of\ngalactic gaseous halos in chemical evolution of disk galaxies has not been so far investigated\nby numerical simulations. We mainly discuss how the total amount and distribution of gas\nejected from a bulge and then accreted onto the disk depend on physical properties of the\ngaseous halo and the bulge ejecta. It should be stressed here that the bulge wind would need\nto have taken place in the Galaxy several Gyr ago to explain the possible ages of the super\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nmetal-rich solar neighborhood stars (Tsujimoto 2007).\n\n2.\n\nThe model\n\nWe numerically investigate the dynamical evolution of gas ejected from bulges in disk\ngalaxies using our own GRAPE-SPH codes as we have done in previous studies (e.g., Bekki\n& Chiba 2006). A disk galaxy is represented by a dark matter halo, gaseous halo, stellar\nand gaseous disks, a stellar bulge, and gas initially within the bulge (referred to as \"bulge\ngas\" for convenience from now on). The dark matter halo has an \"NFW\" profile (Navarro\net al. 1996) with total mass of Mdm , scale length rs , and c parameter of 10. The gaseous\nhalo has mass Mhg and the same spatial distribution as the dark matter and is assumed to\nbe initially in hydrostatic equilibrium. The initial gaseous temperature of a halo gas particle\nis therefore determined by the gas density, total mass, and gravitational potential at the\nlocation of the particle via Euler's equation for hydrostatic equilibrium (e.g., the equation\n1E-8 in Binney & Tremaine 1987).\nThe bulge has a Hernquist profile (Hernquist 1990) with mass Mb and scale-length ab .\nThe disk has an exponential density profile with mass Md , radius Rd , and scale length ad\n(= 0.2Rd ). The stellar and gaseous disks have masses of Ms and Mg , respectively, and the\nsame exponential density profile, and the gas mass fraction (Mg /Md ) is a free parameter.\nIn addition to the rotational velocity due to the gravitational field of disk, halo, bulge components, initial radial and azimuthal velocity dispersion are assigned to the disk component\naccording to the epicyclic theory using Toomre's parameter (Binney & Tremaine 1987) Q\n= 1.5. We do not include the outflow of stellar winds from stars in the disk in the present\nmodels, because we think that the stellar winds with lower metallicities do not significantly\ninfluence chemical evolution of the disk in comparison with the metal-rich bulge wind.\nThe initial distribution of the bulge gas with mass Mbg is assumed to be the same as\nthat of the bulge and each bulge gas particle is assumed to be ejected from the bulge in\nthe radial direction with the ejection velocity vej . Also the particles are assumed to have\ninitial rotational velocities of vrot (around the z-axis) ranging from 0 to a circular velocity\nat R = 5ab . We show the results of the models with vrot = 212 km s\u22121 , because the results\ndo not depend strongly on vrot . All bulge gas particles are assumed to have the same initial\nvej and vrot in each simulation. The initial temperature of the bulge gas (Tbg ) is assumed\nto be 104 K, which corresponds to warm ionized gas observed in starburst galaxies such as\nM82 (e.g., Heckman et al. 1987). The models with very high temperatures of Tbg \u223c 106 K\ndo not show significant gas accretion onto disks.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nSince we mainly discuss the abundance properties of the Galactic disk, we chose the\nfollowing values of the model parameters for disk galaxies: Mdm = 1012 M\u2299 , rs /ad = 5,\nMd = 6 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , ad = 3.5 kpc, fg = 0.1, Mb = 1010 M\u2299 , and ab = 0.7 kpc. The most\nimportant parameters in the present study are the mean halo gas density \u03c1hg within 3Rd\ndetermined from Mhg and vej for a given Mbg . Although we have investigated many models\nwith different \u03c1hg and vej , we show the results of the standard model M1 with \u03c1hg = 10\u22125\ncm\u22123 , vej = 500 km s\u22121 , and Mbg = 108 M\u2299 . Strong bulge winds can be more clearly seen in\nthe models with vej \u2265 500 km s\u22121 . Sembach et al. (2003) showed that the Galaxy gaseous\nhalo is highly extended (R > 70 kpc) and low-density (\u03c1hg \u2264 10\u22124 \u221210\u22125 cm\u22123 ), which means\nthat the adopted \u03c1hg is reasonable. The total number of particles used in a simulation ranges\nfrom 228805 to 258805 depending on fg and Mhg .\nParameter values of the models (M1 to M7) discussed in this paper are shown in Table\n1. We do not discuss how rotation of gaseous halos influences the accretion processes of\nbulge gas onto disks, because we find that the influence is not significant. We show some\nresults of comparative models in which fg = 0 and \u03c1hg = 0 cm\u22123 : these models enable us to\ngrasp essential roles of gaseous halos in the accretion processes, though they are unrealistic.\nWe will describe in detail the results of models not discussed in this paper (e.g., those with\ndifferent Mbg and vrot ) in our future papers. We mainly investigate the final total mass\nof bulge gas particles settled around \"the solar neighborhood\" (R = R\u2299 \u223c 2.5ad ) with 7\nkpc \u2264 R \u2264 10 kpc and |z| \u2264 1 kpc (Macc ) for each model. We also investigate the mass\nratio (facc ) of Macc to Mbg for each model. The final gaseous distributions at T = 0.45 Gyr\ncorrespond to those of the Galaxy about several Gyr ago in the present study.\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\nFig. 1 shows how gas ejected from a bulge evolves with time during hydrodynamical\ninteraction between the gas and the halo gas in a disk galaxy for the standard model M1.\nAlthough a significant fraction of the gas once escapes from the bulge (T = 0.11 Gyr), most\nof the gas can be finally returned to the disk plane owing to gaseous pressure from the halo\nand the disk (T = 0.45 Gyr). The bulge gas particles initially in the central region of the\nbulge can interact so strongly with the disk gas particles immediately after the ejection that\na thin disk can be formed from the bulge gas at R < 3 kpc for a short time scale (T = 0.06\nGyr). The bulge gas particles ejected from the bulge regions with larger |z| can be later\naccreted onto the outer part of the disk and consequently can rotate around the center of\nthe galaxy. The mean orbital eccentricity of bulge gas particles in the solar neighborhood is\n0.08 in this model, which means that the orbits become almost circular, because the particles\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nhave acquired orbital angular momentum during hydrodynamical interaction with the disk\ngas.\nFig. 2 shows that Macc increases with time owing to rapid accretion of the bulge gas and\nthe mean accretion rate within 0.45 Gyr is 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 in the standard model. The\nmass-ratio (facc ) of Macc to Mbg is \u223c 0.01, which means that a small fraction of the bulge gas\ncan be accreted onto the solar neighborhood. Fig. 2 also shows that this result of small Macc\nis true for the comparative model M2 with reasonable \u03c1hg , which suggests that the bulge gas\ncan not so efficiently be accreted onto the disk outside the solar neighborhood irrespective\nof \u03c1hg . The more rapid accretion and smaller Macc in the model M2 is due largely to the\nstronger hydrodynamical interaction between the bulge and the halo gas. Fig. 3 shows that\nalmost 80% of the bulge gas can be accreted onto the (inner) disk region with R \u2264 3 kpc in\nthe standard model: this preferential accretion can be clearly seen also in the model M2.\nFig. 4 compares the final distributions of bulge gas particles at T = 0.45 Gyr between\ndifferent four models (M2 \u2212 5). Only a compact thin disk with Macc = 1.4 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 can be\ndeveloped from the bulge gas in the model M3 without halo gas, which clearly demonstrates\nthat hydrodynamical interaction between bulge and halo gas in a disk galaxy is crucial for\nthe accretion of the bulge gas onto the outer part of the disk. Model M4 contain no disk and\nhalo gas (i.e., fg = 0 and \u03c1hg = 0 cm\u22123 ) and does not show a thin disk, which means that the\npresence of gas disks is also important for recycling of the bulge ejecta in disk galaxies. This\nresult of M4 combined with that of M1 confirms that hydrodynamical interaction between\nbulge and disk gas is essential for forming a rotating gas disk composed of the bulge gas.\nThe bulge gas can be pushed back to the inner disk more strongly and quickly by the\nhalo gas owing to stronger hydrodynamical pressure of the gaseous halo against the bulge\ngas in the model M2. In this case the bulge gas can be accreted only onto the inner disk\nrather than the outer one in M2: only a very small fraction of the bulge gas can reach the\nsolar neighborhood and outer gaseous streams and small gas clumps seen in the standard\nmodel are not seen in M2. The small gas clumps seen in the standard model might well be\nidentified as high-velocity clouds, if they can form H i gas owing to efficient cooling. Less\nenergetic gaseous flow from the bulge can be pushed back to the disk by the gaseous halo so\nthat a thin disk with no small gas clumps is formed in the model M5.\nThe dependences of facc on model parameters are summarized as follows. Firstly, there\nis an optimum vej which maximizes facc for a reasonable \u03c1hg = 10\u22125 cm\u22123 . A larger fraction\nof bulge gas can escape from the disk for larger vej so that a smaller fraction of the ejecta is\nfinally accreted onto the solar neighborhood in the model M6 with vej = 1000 km s\u22121 . On\nthe other hand, a smaller fraction of the bulge gas can reach R = R\u2299 owing to less energetic\nflow so that a smaller fraction of the gas can be accreted onto the solar neighborhood in\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nmodel M5 with vej = 200 km s\u22121 . Thus, facc is maximum for moderately energetic stellar\nwinds such as vej = 500 km s\u22121 .\nNevertheless, facc can be higher for higher \u03c1hg in the models with vej = 1000 km s\u22121 :\nin this case, higher densities of the halo gas are required for preventing the bulge gas from\nescaping the disk for more energetic stellar winds. This \u03c1hg -dependence of facc is totally\ndifferent from that seen for vej = 500 km s\u22121 , which implies that facc depends on \u03c1hg and vej\nin a complicated way. The model M4 with no halo/disk gas shows facc (0.18) higher than\nthat in model M3 with disk gas. Such high facc in M4 is due to bulge gas particles that\nhappen to be around the solar-neighborhood but are not rotating the disk: these particles\nsoon return back to their original locations. It should be finally noted that the present results\ndo not depend strongly on vrot .\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\nOur results indicate for the first time that gaseous halos of disk galaxies are very important for chemical evolution of the disks in the sense that they enable the galaxies to recycle\nthe metal-rich stellar winds from the bulges and accelerate the chemical enrichment of galactic disks. The derived preferential accretion of the gaseous ejecta onto the inner disks will\nlead to a steepening of the abundance gradient after the action of strong central starbursts\nin the bulges followed by stellar winds. This steep abundance gradient is predicted to flatten\nwith time owing to a subsequent chemical enrichment under an accretion of low-metallicity\ninfall from the halo (Tsujimoto et al. 2008), which is in accord with the observed flattening\nfeature in radial metallicity gradients over the last several Gyr (Chen et al. 2003; Maciel et\nal. 2006, 2007).\nOur important finding is that the metal-rich gaseous ejecta from the bulge can reach\nand chemically enrich the solar neighborhood through a one-time sporadic accretion event\ntriggered by a starburst. This mechanism offers a promising channel to produce super-metalrich stars with +0.2 <[Fe/H]< +0.4, the presence of which can not be accounted for by the\nconventional scheme of Galactic chemical evolution models (Tsujimoto 2007). An important\ncaveat is that the observed very metal-rich stars with [Fe/H]\u223c +0.4 would need to be formed\ndirectly from the bulge gas without significant dilution with metal-poor halo and disk gas.\nUsing the observed metallicity distribution function by Nordstr\u00f6m et al. (2004), we\nestimate that the mass fraction of metal-rich stars with +0.2 <[Fe/H]< +0.4 is about 4% in\nthe solar annulus. This means that the possible total stellar mass (Mmr ) of the metal-rich\nstars for 8 kpc \u2264 R \u2264 9 kpc (i.e., the solar annulus) is about 3 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 for the adopted\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nGalactic disk mass of 6 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 and the exponential scale length of 3.5 kpc. The total\nmass of the metal-rich stars thus would give some constraints on (i) the total mass of the\ninitial bulge wind (thus the strength of the central starburst) and (ii) to what degree the\nmetal-rich bulge gas (e.g., [Fe/H]\u223c+0.4) needs to be diluted via mixing of halo/disk gas to\nform less metal-rich stars with [Fe/H]\u223c+0.2.\nOur study shows that about 1 % of gas ejected from bulges in disk galaxies can be\naccreted onto the disks at R \u223c 2.5ad for a reasonable set of model parameters in the present\nstudy. This suggests that chemical evolution of the outer parts (R \u223c 3ad ) of the disks can\nnot be so strongly influenced by the accretion of the metal-rich gaseous ejecta. This also\nimplies that if infalling metal-rich gas with [Fe/H]\u223c+0.4 in the Galaxy can be mixed well\nwith the gas with [Fe/H] \u223c 0 and a similar mass already present in the solar neighborhood\nand then form new stars from the mixed gas, the new stars would have [Fe/H]\u223c+0.2: they\nhowever are unlikely to exhibit super-solar metallicities with [Fe/H]\u223c +0.4. However, if new\nstars can form preferentially from the metal-rich gas during the accretion of the gas onto the\ndisk for some physical reasons, formation of new stars with super-solar metallicities would\nbe possible. Our simulations imply that (i) dilution of the metal-rich bulge gas is likely to\noccur after the accretion of the gas onto the Galaxy and (ii) the dilution due to interaction\nwith halo gas would be unlikely owing to rapid accretion of the bulge gas.\nPrevious chemical evolution models of disk galaxies did not consider rapid accretion of\nmetal-rich gas ejected from bulges onto disks (e.g., Lacey & Fall 1985; Prantzos & Aubert\n1995; Chiappini et al. 1997). The present study suggests that future more sophisticated\nchemical evolution models need to include possible influences of the rapid accretion on chemical evolution for disk galaxies, in particular, for those with bigger bulges which would have\nexperienced stronger nuclear starbursts. The present study has not clarified (i) local (pcscale) star formation processes during the accretion of metal-rich gas onto disks and (ii)\nmetallicities of new stars formed from the star formation. We plan to investigate numerically how mixing processes of metal-poor disk gas and metal-rich bulge ejecta within disks\ndetermine the metallicities of new stars formed during the accretion of the ejecta.\nWe are grateful to the anonymous referee for valuable comments, which contribute to\nimprove the present paper.
