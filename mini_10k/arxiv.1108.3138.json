Introduction\nThe aim of this paper is to draw attention to the possibility of resolving several problems of dynamo theory for solar activity by combining diamagnetic\nturbulent pumping and a nonlocal \u03b1-effect in a solar dynamo model.\nIn the absence of reliable data on magnetic fields in the deep solar interior,\nmodeling the solar dynamo remains a controversial issue (for a recent review, see\nTobias, 2009). Consensus has developed that the dynamo is driven by two basic\neffects. The \u03a9-effect of nonuniform rotation produces a strong toroidal field from\na poloidal one and the \u03b1-effect of cyclonic motion (Parker, 1955) regenerates the\npoloidal field. Already the first models of an \u03b1\u03a9-dynamo produced oscillatory solutions resembling the solar cycle (Leighton, 1969; Steenbeck and Krause, 1969).\nIf discrepancies between computed and observed parameters within two orders\nof magnitude are tolerable, these pioneering models are quite satisfactory. A\ncloser agreement is difficult and may even seem impossible to obtain in view of\nthe basic physics of the dynamo process and decades-long practice of dynamo\nsimulations.\n1\n\nInstitute for Solar-Terrestrial Physics, P.O.

Kitchatinov, S.V. Olemskoy\n\nAlready K\u00f6hler (1973) noticed that turbulent magnetic diffusivity should be\nreduced much below the standard mixing-length value of \u03b7T \u2248 1013 cm2 s\u22121 in\norder to reproduce the observed period of the solar cycle. The time of diffusive\ndecay of a magnetic field can be estimated as Td \u2248 d2 \u03b7T\u22121 , where d is the depth\nof the convection zone. A cyclic dynamo has to regenerate fields in a shorter\ntime in order to overpower the diffusive decay, so that Pcyc < Td (Pcyc is the\nperiod of the magnetic cycle). The observed period can be reproduced with a\ndiffusivity value much smaller than 1013 cm2 s\u22121 , this case, however, is difficult\nto justify. Eddy viscosity or thermal diffusivity below 1013 cm2 s\u22121 cannot be\na correct parameterization for solar convection because with such small eddy\ndiffusion the external layers of the Sun are still unstable (Tuominen et al., 1994;\nKitchatinov and Mazur, 2000). The assumption of small magnetic diffusion needs to explain why the same turbulent mixing transports momentum and heat\nmuch more efficiently than a magnetic field. Theories of turbulent transport\ncoefficients do not support the assumption of large magnetic Prandtl number.\nDirect numerical simulations of Yousef, Brandenburg, and R\u00fcdiger (2003) also\ngive this number of the order of unity.\nObservations show a clear predominance of the equator-antisymmetric (dipolar) component in the global magnetic field of the Sun (Stenflo, 1988). The\nsymmetric part is relatively small and does not show an 11-year cycle. The\ncritical dynamo numbers for the excitation of the global modes of these two types\nof symmetry are usually very close together. The threshold dynamo number for\nthe antisymmetric modes may be relatively small, leading to the preference for\nthis type of symmetry, but the situation can usually be changed to the preference\nfor the symmetric modes by small variations of parameters in a dynamo model.\nIn other words, the equatorial symmetry is unstable to small changes in the\ndesign of dynamo models. Another problem is related to the ratio of toroidalto poloidal-field amplitudes. The ratio is not smaller than a thousand if the\npoloidal field is estimated by its polar value and the toroidal field - by the field\nstrength in sunspots. Solar differential rotation of about 30% can produce in the\n11 years of the solar cycle a toroidal field that is at most 40 times stronger than\nthe poloidal filed. Strong radial gradient of rotation in the tachocline does not\nchange this estimation because the radial field should be as much weaker there\ncompared to the meridional field as the radial shear is larger than the latitudinal\nshear (except for in cases of the relic field penetrating from the radiation zone,\nor the field having a structure with multiple latitudinal belts, both cases present\nnew problems).\nAnother problem of the so-called catastrophic quenching of the \u03b1-effect (Gruzinov and Diamond, 1994; Brandenburg and Subramanian, 2005) is not directly\nrelated to observations but is 'internal' for theory. It can be outlined as follows.\nThe large-scale fields generated by \u03b1-effect dynamos are helical. As the magnetic\nhelicity is conserved, small-scale magnetic fields attain helicity equal in amount\nand opposite in sign to that of large-scale fields. Helical small-scale fields produce\ntheir own magnetic \u03b1-effect that counteracts the \u03b1-effect of whatever origin so\nthat the total \u03b1-effect strongly diminishes.\nIn a recent paper (Kitchatinov and Olemskoy, 2011a), we demonstrated that\nthe catastrophic quenching is alleviated in a solar dynamo model that combines\n\nSOLA: sdap.tex; 18 November 2018; 3:27; p. 2\n\n\fSolar Dynamo Model\n\na nonlocal \u03b1-effect and diamagnetic pumping of large-scale fields by turbulent\nconvection. In this new publication it is shown that with this model other\nabove-mentioned problems also fade. The diamagnetic pumping, which will be\ndiscussed in the next section, concentrates the magnetic field at the bottom\nof the convection zone. The turbulent diffusion in this region is small. As a\nresult, the solar cycle period can be reproduced. The poloidal field in the nearbase region is much stronger than on the surface and sufficiently strong for\nthe differential rotation to generate kilogauss toroidal fields over a solar cycle.\nThe critical dynamo number for dipolar dynamo modes is considerably smaller\ncompared to quadrupolar modes, so that the model always results in a global\nfield of dipolar parity. However, the model still has difficulties in reproducing\ntime-latitude diagrams of solar magnetism. We include the meridional flow and\nvary the latitudinal profile of the \u03b1-effect to reproduce observational butterfly\ndiagrams.\n\n2. Diamagnetic Pumping\nDiamagnetic pumping of large-scale fields was predicted theoretically long time\nago (Zeldovich, 1957; R\u00e4dler, 1968) but is scarcely known in the dynamo community and is usually ignored in dynamo models (see, however, R\u00fcdiger and Brandenburg, 1995; K\u00e4pyl\u00e4, Korpi, and Tuominen, 2006; Guerrero and de Gouveia\nDal Pino, 2008).\nThe nature of diamagnetic pumping is well illustrated by the case of inhomogeneous 2D turbulence with the fluctuating velocity u\u2032 uniform along a\ndirection defined, say, by the unit vector e and inhomogeneous in the direction\n2\nperpendicular to e: \u2207hu\u2032 i 6= 0, (e * \u2207)u\u2032 = 0. For this case, Zeldovich (1957)\nfound that the mean electromotive force, E = hu\u2032 \u00d7 B\u2032 i (B\u2032 is a fluctuating\nmagnetic field), can be written as\nE = \u2212\u2207 \u00d7 (\u03b7T B) ,\n\n(1)\n\nif the large-scale field B is also perpendicular to e; \u03b7T is the turbulent magnetic\ndiffusivity. This means that the large-scale field is transported with the effective\nvelocity\nUdia = \u2212\u2207\u03b7T .\n\n(2)\n\nThe diamagnetic pumping expels the field from the regions of relatively high\nturbulence intensity. However, for the case of the mean field parallel to the\ndirection e, the mean electromotive force reads\nE = \u2212\u03b7T \u2207 \u00d7 B\n\n(3)\n\nand there is no diamagnetic pumping. The magnetic field parallel to the edirection, ekB, behaves like a scalar field. The diamagnetic pumping, therefore,\nis related to the vectorial nature of magnetic fields, and there is no counterpart\nof diamagnetic pumping for scalar fields.\n\nSOLA: sdap.tex; 18 November 2018; 3:27; p. 3\n\n\fL.L. Kitchatinov, S.V. Olemskoy\n\nFigure 1. Pictorial explanation of diamagnetic pumping (see text). Turbulent intensity increases from left to right. Undisturbed magnetic lines are shown by dashed lines. When a flux\ntube is displaced by motion, its right boundary is moving faster on average. Displacements to\nthe left compress the flux tube and the field strength in the displaced region increases. Material\nis evacuated from the displaced region as shown by arrows. Displacements to the right result\non average in a decrease in field strength in the displaced region.\n\nThe pumping effect can be interpreted as follows (Figure 1). Imagine that\nthere is a background field perpendicular to both the direction e and the gradient\nof turbulence intensity. If the turbulent motion displaces a flux tube of such a field\nas the one on the left in Figure 1, i.e., in the direction of decreasing turbulence\nintensity, the left boundary of the tube is on average moving slower than the right\nboundary. The tube is compressed, and the field strength in the displaced region\nincreases. Similarly, displacement to the right decreases the field strength in the\ndisplaced region. Turbulent mixing produces on average the field transport in\nthe direction of decreasing turbulent intensity, i.e., turbulent conducting fluids\nbehave diamagnetic.\nIn the 3D case, the expression for the effective velocity of diamagnetic transport changes to (Krause and R\u00e4dler, 1980)\n1\nUdia = \u2212 \u2207\u03b7T .\n2\n\n(4)\n\nThe diamagnetic pumping can be very efficient near the bottom of the convection\nzone where the intensity of turbulent convection changes sharply with depth\n(Kitchatinov and R\u00fcdiger, 2008).\nDoubts have been expressed concerning the efficiency of the pumping in a\nnonlinear regime (Vainshtein and Kitchatinov, 1983). However, turbulent diamagnetism was recently detected in laboratory experiments with liquid sodium\n(Spence et al., 2007). Direct numerical simulations also show downward pumping of large-scale fields near the base of convectively unstable layers (Tobias et al.,\n1998; Tobias et al., Dorch and Nordlund, Ossendrijver et al., 1998, 2001, 2002;\nZigler and R\u00fcdiger, 2003). Whether the simulations indeed show the turbulent\ndiamagnetism is not perfectly clear. Their results were interpreted in terms of the\nDrobyshevski and Yuferev (1974) effect of topological pumping (Tobias et al.,\n2001; Dorch and Nordlund, 2001). Anyway, the diamagnetic and topological\n\nSOLA: sdap.tex; 18 November 2018; 3:27; p. 4\n\n\fSolar Dynamo Model\n\npumpings are of the same sense (downward) near the base of the convection zone.\nWe apply the Equation (4) for the effective transport velocity in our dynamo\nmodel.\nIt may be noted that turbulent diffusion and pumping are both reduced by\nrotation and/or a magnetic field. Tobias et al. (2001) and Ziegler and R\u00fcdiger\n(2003) observed the rotational quenching effect in numerical simulations. An\nanalytical theory of turbulent transport predicts that though the turbulent diffusion and pumping are modified, the relation (4) between their isotropic parts\nsurvives under the influence of rotation or a magnetic field (Kitchatinov, 1988).\n3. The Model\n3.1. Dynamo Equations\nOur dynamo model is based on the mean-field induction equation\n\u2202B\n= \u2207 \u00d7 (V \u00d7 B + E) .\n\u2202t\n\n(5)\n\nThe large-scale flow is a superposition of rotation and meridional circulation,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c8\n1\n,\n(6)\nV = e\u03c6 r sin \u03b8\u03a9f (r, \u03b8) + \u2207 \u00d7 e\u03c6\n\u03c1\nr sin \u03b8\nwhere the usual spherical coordinates are used, \u03a9 is the characteristic value of\nangular velocity, f is the normalized frequency of differential rotation, \u03c8 is the\nmeridional flow stream function, \u03c1 is density, and e\u03c6 is the azimuthal unit vector.\nThe mean electromotive force is written as\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u221a\nE = \u2212 \u03b7T \u2207 \u00d7\n\u03b7T B + A,\n(7)\n\nwhere the first term on the right stands for both turbulent diffusion and the\ndiamagnetic pumping of Equation (4). The second term accounts for the \u03b1-effect\nin its nonlocal formulation (Brandenburg, R\u00e4dler, and Schrinner, 2008)\nZ\nA = \u03b1(r, r\u2032 )B(r\u2032 ) d3 r\u2032 .\n(8)\n\nThe local \u03b1-effect is subject to the catastrophic quenching mechanism (Brandenburg and Subramanian, 2005) while the nonlocal \u03b1-effect is not (Kitchatinov\nand Olemskoy, 2011a), and for this reason it may be dominating in the dynamo process. Another possibility to avoid the catastrophic quenching is to\ninvoke sufficiently efficient fluxes of magnetic helicity (Guerrero, Chatterjee, and\nBrandenburg, 2010).\nSimilar to the mean flow of Equation (6), the magnetic field can be written\nas a superposition of its toroidal and poloidal parts,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nA\n,\n(9)\nB = e\u03c6 B + \u2207 \u00d7 e\u03c6\nr sin \u03b8\n\nSOLA: sdap.tex; 18 November 2018; 3:27; p. 5\n\n\fL.L. Kitchatinov, S.V. Olemskoy\n\nwhere A is the poloidal field potential.\nHere we introduce normalized variables. The time is measured in units of\n2\nR\u2299\n/\u03b70 ; \u03b70 is the characteristic value of the eddy diffusivity. The magnetic field is\nnormalized to the field strength B0 for which nonlinear effects become essential,\nand the \u03b1-parameter is normalized to its characteristic value \u03b10 . The poloidal\n3\nfield potential is measured in units of \u03b10 B0 R\u2299\n/\u03b70 .

We always use xb =\nxi + 2.5hb and x\u03b1 = 1 \u2212 2.5h\u03b1 to ensure smoothness of the kernel functions in\nthe simulation domain. The parameter hb -parameter represents the thickness of\nthe near-bottom region of toroidal magnetic fields producing the \u03b1-effect. The\nparameter h\u03b1 represents the thickness of the near-surface layer where this effect\nis produced. The \u03b1-effect with the kernel function of Equation (16) is very close\nto the nonlocal model of Brandenburg and K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 (2007). It is also similar to\nthe Babcock-Leighton mechanism for the poloidal field production used in the\ndynamo models of Durney (1995) and Dikpati and Charbonneau (1999).\nThe turbulent diffusivity in the bulk of the convection zone varies slightly with\ndepth. Near the base of the convection zone, it drops sharply with increasing\ndepth. The diffusivity profile of our model reads\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nx \u2212 x\u03b7\n1\n,\n\u03b7(x) = \u03b7in + (1 \u2212 \u03b7in ) 1 + erf\n2\nh\u03b7\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03b7in is the ratio of diffusivity near the inner boundary to its value in the\nbulk of the convection zone.

Meridional Flow\nA poleward meridional flow of the order of 10 m s\u22121 is observed on the solar\nsurface (Komm, Howard, and Harvey, 1993). Helioseismology confirms that the\nflow persists up to a depth of about 12 Mm (Zhao and Kosovichev, 2004). Theoretical modeling remains the only source of knowledge about the flow in deeper\nregions. Recent simulations predict that one cell of meridional circulation occupies the entire thickness of the convection zone and the return flow at the bottom\nis not small compared to the surface (Kitchatinov and Olemskoy, 2011b). Beneath the convection zone, the flow is small (Gilman and Miesch, 2004; Kitchatinov and R\u00fcdiger, 2006). All these findings are qualitatively reflected by the\nfollowing representation for the stream function of the meridional flow\n\u03c8 = \u2212 cos \u03b8 sin2 \u03b8 \u03c6(x),\n\uf8f1\nR1\n\uf8f4\n1\n\uf8f4\n\u03c1(x\u2032 )\u03b7 p (x\u2032 )(x\u2032 \u2212 xs ) dx\u2032 for x \u2265 xs\n\uf8f2 1\u2212x\ns\nx\n\u03c6(x) =\nRx\n\uf8f4\n\u2032 p \u2032\n\uf8f4\n\u03c1(x\n)\u03b7 (x )(xs \u2212 x\u2032 ) dx\u2032\nfor x \u2264 xs .\nC\n\uf8f3\n\n(18)\n\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u00133/2\n1\n\u03c1(x) = 1 + C\u03c1\n\u22121\n,\nx\n\n(19)\n\nxi\n\nIn this equation, xs is the radius of the stagnation point where the meridional\nvelocity changes sign, and C is a parameter whose value is adjusted to ensure\ncontinuity of the stream function at the stagnation point.\nThe stratification of the convection zone is almost adiabatic. An adiabatic\nprofile for ideal gas was used for the normalized density,\n\nSOLA: sdap.tex; 18 November 2018; 3:27; p. 9\n\n\fL.L. Kitchatinov, S.V. Olemskoy\n\nFigure 4.

The radius of the stagnation point, xs \u2243 0.84, was adjusted so that\nthe amplitudes of the flow above and below this point are equal. We set the\nparameter p = 0.25 in Equation (18), so that the bottom flow is about ten times\nslower than the maximum velocity of the deep equator-ward flow.\n\n4. Results and Discussion\n4.1. Models without Meridional Flow\nWe will discuss the models without meridional flow (Rm = 0) first. Then, we\nwill include the flow to see what effect it produces.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5. Dependence of the critical dynamo number (a) and the magnetic cycle period (b)\non the thickness hb of the near-bottom layer producing the \u03b1-effect. Full and dotted lines show\nthe results for dipolar and quadrupolar dynamo modes, respectively.\n\nSOLA: sdap.tex; 18 November 2018; 3:27; p. 10\n\n\fSolar Dynamo Model\n\nFigure 5 shows the dependencies of the critical dynamo number and magnetic\ncycle period on the thickness hb of the near-bottom layer producing the \u03b1-effect\n(for constant ht = 0.02). The cycle period Pcyc is defined as half the complete\nperiod of magnetic oscillations in order to compare with the 11-year solar cycle.\nThe dipolar parity and the observed period of magnetic oscillations can be reproduced only with a sufficiently thin bottom layer, hb < 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 . Only in this\ncase the equator-antisymmetric modes of the magnetic field are preferred and\nthe cycle period is sufficiently long. For the value \u03b70 = 1013 cm2 s\u22121 of magnetic\n2\ndiffusivity, the diffusion time R\u2299\n/\u03b70 \u2248 15 years and the cycle period in physical\n2\nunits, Pcyc R\u2299 /\u03b70 , is close to 11 years for small hb . Also for a thin bottom layer\nonly, the critical dynamo number for the excitation of magnetic fields of dipolar\nparity is about 30% smaller compared to quadrupolar parity modes so that the\nmodel produces equator-antisymmetric global fields similar to the Sun. A strong\ndecrease of magnetic diffusivity towards the bottom boundary is also important for preference of dipolar parity (Chatterjee, Nandy, and Choudhuri, 2004;\nHotta and Yokoyama, 2010). We conclude that our model can reproduce a solar\ncycle only if the \u03b1-effect is produced by sufficiently deep-seated toroidal fields.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6. Dependence of the critical dynamo number (a) and the magnetic cycle period (b) on\nthe thickness ht of the near-top layer where the \u03b1-effect is produced. Full and dotted lines show\nthe results for dipolar and quadrupolar modes of magnetic field, respectively. hb = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 .\n\nThe dynamo numbers shown in Figure 5 have a minimum at about hb =\n2 \u00d7 10\u22123 , and all the results to follow were produced with this value. For smaller\nhb , the critical dynamo numbers are larger because of the decrease in the toroidal\nmagnetic flux producing the \u03b1-effect. For larger hb , the bottom layer is thicker\nthan the vertical scale of the toroidal field and the fields of opposite signs partly\ncancel each other's contribution to the \u03b1-effect. The dependence on the thickness\nht of the top layer where the \u03b1-effect is produced is simpler. The cycle period\nshown in Figure 6 does not depend on ht until the thickness becomes so large\nthat the top and bottom layers overlap. There is also a smooth decrease in\nthe critical dynamo numbers with increasing ht . We fix ht = 0.02 for further\ncomputations.\nFigure 7 shows the magnetic field patterns in the meridional cross-section\nfor several instances of a cycle. The magnetic field is highly concentrated at\n\nSOLA: sdap.tex; 18 November 2018; 3:27; p. 11\n\n\fL.L. Kitchatinov, S.V. Olemskoy\n\nFigure 7.

The\npictures of the upper row are re-scaled so that the upper (dashed) boundary shows the radius\nof r = 0.74R\u2299 , below which the toroidal fields are localized. The dynamo number D = 2.2\u00d7104\nis slightly above the critical value of 1.9 \u00d7 104 .\n\nthe bottom. The concentration is provided by the diamagnetic pumping. The\npumping, however, does not affect the (radial) component of the field parallel to\nthe pumping direction and the poloidal field lines can come to the surface. The\ntoroidal field is confined below the radius of x\u03b7 where the magnetic diffusivity\ndrops sharply with depth. The poloidal field near the bottom is also much\nstronger than at the top. As a result, the toroidal field amplitude in our model\nis about a thousand times stronger than the amplitude of the surface polar field.\nIf the poloidal field at the bottom were of the same order as at the top, the\ndifferential rotation would not be able to produce a strong toroidal field over a\ncycle. Note that the deep toroidal field of several kilogauss in our model is the\nmean field. The total field can include strong fluctuations on the background of\nthe mean field.\nFigure 8 shows butterfly diagrams for the surface radial field and deep toroidal\nfield.

The factor sin \u03b8 in\nEquation (20) accounts for the dependence of the length of toroidal flux tubes on\nlatitude (it is supposed that the probability of sunspot production is proportional\nto the length of the tube).\n\nFigure 9. Time-latitude diagrams for the model with meridional flow. A standard latitudinal\nprofile of the \u03b1-effect, \u03b1 \u223c cos \u03b8, was used. The dynamo number D = 2.6 \u00d7 104 is slightly above\nthe critical value of Dc = 2.36 \u00d7 104 . The top and bottom panels show the deep toroidal field\nand the surface radial field respectively.\n\nSOLA: sdap.tex; 18 November 2018; 3:27; p. 13\n\n\fL.L. Kitchatinov, S.V. Olemskoy\n\nThe radial field diagram of Figure 8 is similar to observational diagrams of\nStenflo (1988) and Obridko et al. (2006). The toroidal field diagram, however,\nhas too broad 'wings' and shows too slow an equatorial drift compared to the\nbutterfly diagram of sunspots. There is a possibility to improve the agreement\nwith allowance for meridional flow.\n4.2. Models with Meridional Flow\nAll computations with meridional flow were performed for the magnetic Reynolds\nnumber Rm = 10 that is a plausible solar value for the magnetic diffusivity\n\u03b70 = 1013 cm2 s\u22121 . The 'local' Reynolds number in the near-bottom region of\nlow diffusivity is, of course, much larger. It may be expected, therefore, that\nthe meridional flow influences primarily the field migration near the bottom.\nIndeed, the toroidal field diagram of Figure 9 shows much faster equatorial drift\ncompared to Figure 8.\n\nFigure 10. Time-latitude diagrams for the model with meridional flow and sin2 \u03b8 cos \u03b8-profile\nof the \u03b1-effect. Computations were performed for the dynamo number D = 4.2 \u00d7 104 , slightly\nabove the critical value of Dc = 3.96 \u00d7 104 . The top and bottom panels show the deep toroidal\nfield and the surface radial field respectively.\n\nNow, however, the poloidal field diagram becomes unsatisfactory. It shows\nequatorial drift also at high latitudes where the poleward migration is actually\nobserved (Stenflo, 1988). The magnetic diffusion near the surface is high and\nthe meridional flow does not influence the surface fields directly. However, the\nsurface poloidal fields are related to the deep toroidal fields by the \u03b1-effect and\nfollow the equatorial migration of the deep fields.\nThe polar drift of the high-latitude poloidal field can be re-established by a\nchange in the latitudinal profile of the \u03b1-effect. Observations indicate that the\ncurrent helicity of solar active regions (the \u03b1-effect proxy) does not increase\nsteadily with latitude but has a maximum at mid latitudes (Sokoloff et al.,\n\nSOLA: sdap.tex; 18 November 2018; 3:27; p. 14\n\n\fSolar Dynamo Model\n\n2008). Theoretical tilt-angles of bipolar magnetic regions show also humps in the\nlatitudinal profiles (D'Silva and Choudhuri, 1993). Figure 10 shows the model\nresults for the sin2 \u03b8 cos \u03b8-profile of the \u03b1-effect, i.e., sin \u03b8 in the last term of\nEquation (13) was changed to sin3 \u03b8. With this profile, the poloidal field diagram\nis in closer agreement with observations.\nSimulations that take into account the meridional flow also result in magnetic\nfields of dipolar parity. The critical dynamo numbers for the excitation of dipolar\nand quadrupolar dynamo modes in the model with the \u03b1-effect peaking at mid\nlatitudes (\u03b1 \u223c sin2 \u03b8 cos \u03b8) are Dcd = 3.96\u00d7104 and Dcq = 4.64\u00d7104, respectively.\nIn the model where the \u03b1-effect peaks at poles (\u03b1 \u223c cos \u03b8), the critical dynamo\nnumbers are closer to each other, Dcd = 2.36\u00d7104 and Dcq = 2.49\u00d7104. Nevertheless, this model also shows the preferred excitation of the equator-antisymmetric\nmagnetic fields.\nThough the meridional flow is important for the latitudinal drift of the magnetic fields in our model, the model does not belong to the so-called advectiondominated dynamos. Figure 10 does not show high concentration of surface\nfields towards the poles typical of advection-dominated dynamo models. This is\nbecause of relatively large magnetic diffusivity near the surface. The cycle period\nin our model is not controlled by the meridional flow. A sufficiently long cycle\nis realized mainly due to the low magnetic diffusivity in the thin layer near the\nbottom boundary and partly due to the diamagnetic pumping to this layer.\nTo probe for the effect of diamagnetic pumping, the computations were repeated with the pumping switched off (for the model with meridional flow\nand mid-latitude peaking \u03b1-effect). The cycle period at the critical dynamo\nnumber reduced to Pcyc = 0.47, i.e., a bit less than twice. Other model parameters are influenced much more. Without diamagnetic pumping, the amount\nof toroidal magnetic flux in the near-bottom region, producing the \u03b1-effect,\ndecreases strongly. Accordingly, the critical dynamo numbers increase by almost\ntwo orders of magnitude, to Dcd = 2.47 \u00d7 106 and Dcq = 2.49 \u00d7 106 with no\nclear preference for dipolar parity. Without the pumping, the poloidal field at all\ndepths is of the same order as at the surface. Accordingly, the ratio of amplitudes\nof the toroidal field to the surface polar field decreased to about 43 from 920 in\nthe model with diamagnetic pumping.\n\n5. Summary\nJoint application of diamagnetic pumping and a nonlocal \u03b1-effect strongly influences the solar-type dynamo model to bring it generally closer to observations. The pumping concentrates magnetic fields near the base of the convection\nzone where diffusivity is relatively small. As a result, the solar cycle period\ncan be reproduced with the standard mixing-length value of eddy diffusivity,\n\u03b7T \u2248 1013 cm2 s\u22121 , in the bulk of the convection zone. The near-base concentration of the poloidal field makes it possible for differential rotation to\nwind a strong toroidal field over a solar cycle so that the toroidal field amplitude in the dynamo model is about a thousand times stronger than the\nsurface polar field. The model produces equator-antisymmetric global fields.\n\nSOLA: sdap.tex; 18 November 2018; 3:27; p. 15\n\n\fL.L. Kitchatinov, S.V. Olemskoy\n\nThe combination of diamagnetic pumping and nonlocal \u03b1-effect also resolves the\ntheoretical problem of the so-called catastrophic quenching of the alpha-effect\n(Kitchatinov and Olemskoy, 2011b).\nThe model without meridional flow does not, however, reproduce the butterfly\ndiagram of sunspot activity. The time-latitude diagram of the toroidal field\nshows too slow equatorial drift and too broad latitudinal distribution in this case\n(Figure 8). This can be corrected by allowance for the meridional circulation and\nthe change of the latitudinal distribution of the \u03b1-effect from a pole-peaked to\na mid-latitude-peaked profile (Figure 10).\nThe prescription for the \u03b1-effect remains the main uncertainty of the model.\nOperation of the nonlocal \u03b1-effect of the Babcock-Leighton type on the Sun\nis plausible from both observational (Dasi-Espuig et al., 2010) and theoretical\n(Caligari, Moreno-Insertis, and Sch\u00fcssler, 1995) evidences. The mathematical\nformulation of this effect remains, however, uncertain. If our model is considered\nas an inverse problem, it predicts that the \u03b1-effect is produced by deep-seated\ntoroidal fields and it is largest at mid latitudes.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors are thankful to an anonymous referee for constructive\n\ncomments.
