INTRODUCTION\n\nThe initial-final mass relation denotes a mapping from\nthe initial mass of a main-sequence star to its final white\ndwarf configuration and hence provides the total mass\nloss that a star has undergone through its lifetime, a\nfundamental property of stellar evolution (Reimers 1975;\nRenzini & Fusi Pecci 1988; Weidemann 2000). At one extreme, a small extrapolation of the high mass end of the\nrelation can lead to constraints on the critical mass that\n1 Data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology, the University of California, and\nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the\nW. M. Keck Foundation.\n2 Based on observations obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii\nTelescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research\nCouncil of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers\nof the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and\nthe University of Hawaii.\n3 University of California Observatories/Lick Observatory, University of California at Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz CA, 95060; jkalirai@ucolick.org\n4 Hubble Fellow\n5 Department of Physics and Astronomy, Box 951547, Knudsen\nHall, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles CA,\n90095; hansen/rmr/reitzel@astro.ucla.edu\n6 Carnegie Observatories, Carnegie Institution of Washington,\n813 Santa Barbara Street, Pasadena CA, 91101; kelson@ociw.edu\n7 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of British\nColumbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6T 1Z1;\nricher@astro.ubc.ca\n\nseparates white dwarf production from type II supernova\nexplosions. This can therefore be used to estimate energetics involved in feedback processes through the prediction of the birth rates of type II supernovae and neutron\nstars (van den Bergh & Tammann 1991). At the opposite extreme, the relation represents a rare tool to probe\nthe progenitor properties of the majority of the evolved\nstars in old stellar populations (most of which are now\nlow mass white dwarfs). If constrained over a large mass\nrange (i.e., 1 \u2013 7 M\u2299 ), the relation can be a powerful\ninput to chemical evolution models of galaxies (including enrichment in the interstellar medium) and therefore\nenhances our understanding of star formation efficiencies\nin these systems (Somerville & Primack 1999).\nThe importance of the initial-final mass relation has\nbeen recently compounded as a result of the discovery\nof thousands of white dwarfs in both the Galactic disk\nand halo. For the former, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nhas spectroscopically confirmed many new white dwarfs\nbringing the total number of such objects in our Galaxy\nto almost 10,000 (Eisenstein et al. 2006). This has led\nto an improved white luminosity function for the disk\nof our Galaxy that shows an abrupt truncation at Mbol\n= 15.3 (Harris et al. 2006). In the Galactic halo, recent Hubble Space Telescope observations of the globular clusters M4 (Richer et al. 2004; Hansen et al. 2004),\nOmega Cen (Monelli et al. 2005), and NGC 6397 (Richer\net al. 2006; Hansen et al. 2007) have similarly uncovered\nseveral thousand cluster white dwarfs. Modeling the lu-\n\n\f2\n\nKalirai et al.\n\nminosity functions of the disk white dwarfs and the cooling sequences of the halo star clusters, directly yields\nthe ages of the Galactic disk and halo components. In\nboth cases, the white dwarf samples are dominated by\nlow mass stars and therefore such modeling requires an\ninput initial-final mass relation that is well understood\nat the low mass end (e.g., Ferrario et al. 2005 and Hansen\net al. 2007).\nThe first attempt to derive an initial-final mass relation was made by Weidemann (1977). He compared theoretical models of mass loss (e.g., Fusi-Pecci & Renzini\n1976) to the observed masses of a few white dwarfs in the\nnearby Hyades and Pleiades clusters and concluded that\nthe observed mass loss was larger than model predictions.\nShortly after this pioneering work, Romanishin & Angel\n(1980) and Anthony-Twarog (1981, 1982) used photographic plates to search for new white dwarf candidates\nin several young open clusters, including NGC 1039,\nNGC 2168, NGC 2287, NGC 2422, NGC 2632 (Praesepe), NGC 6633, NGC 6405, and IC 2602. These studies\nmodeled the expected numbers of white dwarfs in each\ncluster and estimated limits on the boundaries for the upper progenitor mass limit to white dwarf production (5 \u2013\n7 M\u2299 ). Solid constraints on the relation came from subsequent spectroscopic observations of these white dwarfs\nas well as newly discovered degenerate stars in nearby\nopen clusters (Koester & Reimers 1981, 1985, 1993, 1996;\nReimers & Koester 1982, 1989, 1994; Weidemann &\nKoester 1983; Weidemann 1987, 1997; Jeffries 1997).\nThe result of this enormous two-decade long effort was an\ninitial-final mass relation consisting of \u223c20 data points,\nfrom observations of roughly a half-dozen open star clusters (see Weidemann 2000 for a review). The final relation shows a clear trend with higher mass main-sequence\nstars producing increasingly more massive white dwarfs.\nIn the last few years, the amount of data constraining the initial-final mass relation has more than doubled\n(Claver et al. 2001; Dobbie et al. 2004, 2006; Williams,\nBolte, & Koester 2004; Kalirai et al. 2005a; Liebert et al.\n2005; Williams & Bolte 2007). Although the general\ntrend of the relation remains intact, the scatter has increased possibly signifying a relation between the stellar mass loss and the properties of the host environment (e.g., metallicity effects \u2013 Kalirai et al. 2005a).\nAs an extreme example, the recent study of the white\ndwarf population of the super-solar metallicity star cluster NGC 6791 ([Fe/H] = +0.4) has revealed it to be significantly undermassive relative to the field distribution.\nThis is clear evidence that the progenitor stars of these\nremnants experienced enhanced mass loss in post mainsequence evolutionary stages due to the high metallicity\nof the cluster (Kalirai et al. 2007).\nPrior to this study, the oldest open star clusters that\nhave been successfully targeted for white dwarf spectroscopy to build an initial-final mass relation are the\nHyades and Praesepe8 . The ages of both of these systems\nare 600 \u2013 700 Myr (Perryman et al. 1998; Claver et al.\n2001), indicating that the present day turn-off masses are\n&2.75 M\u2299 . This threshold therefore represents the current low mass anchor on the initial-final mass relation as\nall of the white dwarfs in these clusters must have evolved\n8 Fleming et al. (1997) also discuss one object along M67's sightline whose membership remains uncertain.\n\nTABLE 1\nFilter\nNGC 7789\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nNGC 6819\nV\nV\nV\nV\nB\nB\nB\nB\n\nExp.

A very small fraction of all stars in the Universe have masses this large, and therefore the relation is\noften extrapolated to lower masses to provide useful input. Spectroscopic white dwarf studies have been unable\nto target any old open clusters (t > 1 Gyr) for several\nreasons. Primarily, few photometric studies exist that\nhave identified populations of white dwarf candidates in\nthese clusters. Second, the known rich old open clusters\nare generally much further (>10\u00d7) than nearby clusters\nsuch as the Hyades and Praesepe. Finally, because of\ntheir older age, most cluster white dwarfs in these systems have cooled to very faint magnitudes thus making\nit difficult to obtain high quality spectra of the stars.\nWhite dwarfs in the nearest globular star clusters have\nalso recently been targeted for mass measurements by\nseveral groups. The only successful campaign measured\na mean mass of 0.53 M\u2299 for white dwarfs in NGC 6752\n(Moehler et al. 2004). Given the lower S/N of these data,\nthe temperature of the stars was measured from the spectra and then combined with photometric information to\nyield a mass. This mean mass is consistent with several independent arguments that all suggest the masses\nof white dwarfs in globular clusters should be 0.51 \u2013 0.55\nM\u2299 (Renzini & Fusi Pecci 1988; Renzini et al. 1996).\nThe combination of large mosaic cameras on 4-meter\ntelescopes (e.g., CFH12K/MegaCam on the CanadaFrance-Hawaii Telescope) and the advent of bluesensitive multiobject spectrographs on 10-meter telescopes (e.g., LRIS on Keck \u2013 Oke et al. 1995) provide the\nresources necessary to extend the study of the initial-final\nmass relation to a new regime. In this paper we present\ndirect spectroscopic mass determinations of white dwarfs\nin open clusters older than 1 Gyr. The very rich clusters\nNGC 7789 and NGC 6819 are \u223c2\u00d7 and \u223c4\u00d7 older than\nthe Hyades/Praesepe systems, respectively, and have\nbeen recently studied by our team using the CanadaFrance-Hawaii Telescope to very faint magnitudes (V \u223c\n25). The data have uncovered hundreds of white dwarf\ncandidates which have been followed up with the Keck\n\n\fThe Initial-Final Mass Relation\n\n3\n\nFig. 1.- The CMDs of NGC 7789 and NGC 6819 show very tight main-sequences, turnoffs, and post-main sequence evolutionary phases.\nFor example, a \"hook\" is seen above the turnoff designating the contraction of stars that have just exhausted their hydrogen supply. These\nare the deepest CMDs constructed for these clusters to date and the faint-blue region of the CMDs reveals a large population of white\ndwarfs in each cluster (see also Kalirai et al. 2001b).\n\n10-meter telescope and LRIS multiobject spectrograph.\nIn the following section we present our photometric observations of NGC 7789 and NGC 6819 and construct the\ndeepest color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for each cluster to date (\u00a7 3). Parameters (e.g., distance, reddening,\nand age) are derived for each cluster. In \u00a7 4 we discuss\nthe construction of multi-object spectroscopic masks to\nobserve the candidate white dwarfs in each cluster and\ndescribe the general spectroscopic observations. This includes the selection of white dwarf candidates from the\nimaging catalogs. The spectra for all confirmed DA (hydrogen atmosphere) white dwarfs are presented in \u00a7 5 and\nfit to synthetic spectra to derive Teff , log g, masses, and\ncooling ages in \u00a7 6. We eliminate field white dwarfs from\nour sample and calculate the progenitor masses for each\nof the cluster white dwarfs in \u00a7 7. This is used to build a\nnew empirical initial-final mass relation extending down\nto Minitial = 1.6 M\u2299 . When added to our recent study\nof the 8.5 Gyr cluster NGC 6791, the relation is now\nmapped down to Minitial = 1.16 M\u2299 . The results are\npresented and analyzed in \u00a7 8 and the study is summarized in \u00a7 9.\n2. CFHT PHOTOMETRY\n\nAll of the imaging observations of NGC 7789 and\nNGC 6819 were obtained with the CFH12K mosaic CCD\n\ncamera on the 4-meter Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope\n(CFHT), as a part of the CFHT Open Star Cluster Survey (Kalirai et al. 2001a). The camera contains 12 CCDs,\neach with 2048 \u00d7 4096 pixels (a total of over 100 million\npixels), at an individual pixel scale of 0.\u2032\u2032 206. The projection on the sky is 42\u2032 \u00d7 28\u2032 and therefore the dominant\npopulation of both clusters is probed out to near the tidal\nradii.\nWe imaged NGC 7789 from late May to mid July 2001\nin the V and B filters. Similarly, NGC 6819 data were\nacquired in the same filters in October 1999, April 2001,\nand August 2001. Multiple deep exposures were taken\nto achieve a solid detection of the white dwarf cooling sequence in each cluster (no previous white dwarfs\nhad been found in either system). Shallower exposures\nwere also obtained to fill in the brighter main-sequence,\nturnoff, and giant stars, which are saturated on the\nlonger frames. In all exposures, the clusters were placed\nnear the center of the mosaic camera to allow a suitable\nblank field to be constructed from the outer CCDs.\nThe observing conditions were very good for the majority of the exposures (photometric skies, sub-arcsecond\nseeing conditions, and low airmasses). A log of the data\nused in the final analysis is presented in Table 1.\nThe data reduction for NGC 6819 is described in detail in Kalirai et al. (2001b). The final photometric and\n\n\f4\n\nKalirai et al.\n\nastrometric catalogs used in the present study are identical to that earlier set. For NGC 7789, we processed the\nscience frames according to the prescription in Kalirai\net al. (2001a). Summarizing, we obtained several flatfield, bias, and dark images and applied these to the individual science frames using the FITS Large Images Processing Software9 (FLIPS \u2013 see also Kalirai et al. 2001a).\nFLIPS was next used to register and coadd the multiple\nscience exposures for a given exposure time (which were\neach dithered slightly). Photometry was performed on\nthe resulting images using a variable point-spread function in DAOPHOT (Stetson 1994), and calibrated using\nLandolt standard star field observations (Landolt 1992)\nas discussed in \u00a7\u00a7 5.1 and 5.2 of Kalirai et al. (2001a).\nThe final errors in the photometry are very well behaved.\nWe find \u03c3V < 0.05 mag down to V = 24 and \u03c3V < 0.10\nmag down to V = 25.\n3. COLOR-MAGNITUDE DIAGRAMS\n\nNGC 7789 and NGC 6819 are two of the richest open\nstar clusters in the Milky Way. As we show below, the\nclusters are both old and located at a similar distance\nfrom the Sun. The positions of these systems in the\nGalaxy is also quite similar; they are both found within\n10 degrees of the plane of the Galactic disk at l = 115.5\u25e6\n(NGC 7789) and l = 74.0\u25e6 (NGC 6819). Not surprisingly, the CMDs of the two clusters are strikingly similar\nas shown in Figure 1. The contrast of the cluster main sequences over the foreground and background Milky Way\ndisk and halo populations is very strong. In the observational plane, the main sequence can be seen extending\nfrom the bluest point on the present day turnoff (V \u223c\n14.6 and B \u2212 V \u223c 0.6 for NGC 7789, V \u223c 15.4 and\nB \u2212 V \u223c 0.6 for NGC 6819) down to the photometric\nlimit. Just to the red of the main sequence, an equal\nmass binary sequence can be seen in NGC 6819 and also\npossibly in NGC 7789. As we showed through synthetic\nCMD fitting in Kalirai & Tosi (2004), the fraction of\nbinary stars in NGC 6819 is \u223c20 \u2013 30%. The turnoff\nof both clusters is clearly defined as well as an apparent \"hook\" just above the brightest point. This hook\nis caused by a small contraction of the stellar core just\nabove the turnoff. Few, if any, stars are seen in the subgiant branch given the shorter evolutionary timescale of\nthis phase of post main-sequence evolution. However,\nseveral blue-straggler candidates are found above the\nturnoff in both clusters, especially in NGC 6819. The\nhorizontal branches are manifested as red clumps, as expected given the higher metallicity of stars in these two\nsystems. Evolution off the red giant clump is also seen\nat the bright-red part of the CMDs.\nThese CMDs of NGC 7789 and NGC 6819 are the deepest ever constructed for the clusters (note: NGC 6819\nwas presented in Kalirai et al. 2001b). As expected, each\nCMD shows a large population of white dwarfs that had\npreviously not been detected. These cooling sequences,\nin the faint-blue part of the diagrams, extend several\nmagnitudes to the limit of the data (these points have\nbeen made larger for clarity). Unlike our study of the\n0.5 Gyr cluster NGC 2099 (Kalirai et al. 2001c), these\ntwo clusters are old enough that the coolest white dwarfs\n(V = 26 \u2013 27) are beyond our detection limit. The scat9\n\nhttp://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/\u223cjcc/Flips/flips.html\n\nFig. 2.- The distance modulus of NGC 7789 is measured to be\n(m \u2212 M )V = 12.5 \u00b1 0.1 by matching the observed cluster main\nsequence (blue edge) to the Hyades cluster (red dots). The slope\nof the two main-sequences are in excellent agreement over the entire CMD. In this plane, all adjustments (distance, reddening, and\ncolor offset due to metallicity difference) have been made to the\nNGC 7789 stars (see \u00a7 3.1).\n\nter in the cooling sequences results from a combination\nof photometric errors and field contamination, which we\nwill address later in section 7.1.\n3.1. Distance and Age Measurements\nWith just two color photometry, it is very difficult to\nsimultaneously constrain the reddening and distance of a\nstar cluster. When fitting the main sequence, these parameters are degenerate. Fortunately, the reddening can\nbe measured independently from multi-filter photometry.\nWu et al. (2007) recently presented a 13 color CCD spectrophotometric study of NGC 7789 and conclude with\nan estimate of the foreground reddening to NGC 7789\nof E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.28 \u00b1 0.02. In their Table 1, they also\nlist previous measurements (dating back to the work of\nBurbidge & Sandage 1958) and find that their value is in\nfact nicely bracketed by the findings in these independent\nstudies (0.22 < E(B \u2212 V ) < 0.35, see references within\nWu et al. 2007).\nThe cornerstone technique of determining the distance\nof an open star cluster involves fitting the observed main\nsequence to that of the Hyades cluster. As the nearest\nstar cluster to the Sun (d = 46.34 \u00b1 0.27 pc \u2013 Perryman et al. 1998), the distance to each of the Hyades\nmain-sequence stars is accurately known through parallax measurements (to within \u223c2% \u2013 de Bruijne, Hoogerwerf, & de Zeeuw 2001). Therefore, one can directly overlay the Hyades main sequence stars (in an MV , (B \u2212 V )o\nplane) to the observed cluster main-sequence and adjust the distance modulus of the latter until the two\noverlap. Although NGC 7789 is much older than the\nHyades (more than a factor of two), our deep photometry presents a long, unevolved main sequence for this\ncomparison. We do however need to make a slight adjustment given the different metallicities of the clusters.\nThe Hyades is slightly more metal-rich than the Sun, Z\n\n\fThe Initial-Final Mass Relation\n\nFig. 3.- Stellar isochrones from VandenBerg, Bergbusch, &\nDowler (2006) are found to be in excellent agreement with the main\nsequence and main-sequence turnoff of NGC 7789 and NGC 6819\n(although there is a disagreement on the red giant branch of\nNGC 7789). As summarized in section 3.1, we measure an age\nof t = 1.4 Gyr for NGC 7789 and t = 2.5 Gyr for NGC 6819.\n\n= 0.024 (Perryman et al. 1998), whereas NGC 7789 is\nslightly more metal-poor, Z = 0.014 (average of recent\nliterature values, see Wu et al. 2007). Correcting this\noffset amounts to a very small color shift of the mainsequence. The resulting comparison yields an excellent\nalignment of the two main sequences for an NGC 7789\ndistance modulus of (m \u2212 M )V = 12.5 \u00b1 0.1, where the\nerror bar is derived as described in section 8.4 of Kalirai et al. (2001c). This is illustrated in Figure 2 where\nwe have overlaid the Hyades stars on top of the shifted\nNGC 7789 main sequence.\nUsing a similar analysis, Kalirai et al. (2001b) determined the reddening and distance modulus of NGC 6819\nto be E(B \u2212 V ) \u223c 0.10 \u2013 0.14 (see also Bragaglia et al.\n2001) and (m \u2212 M )V = 12.30 \u00b1 0.12.\nWith an estimate of the fundamental parameters in\nplace, we can measure the ages of both clusters using our\nderived CMDs. For this, we have chosen to use the stellar isochrones from VandenBerg, Bergbusch, & Dowler\n(2006) which include a more physical treatment of convective overshooting than past generation models (see\nbelow for a comparison with other models). Our results\nare shown in Figure 3. Assuming [\u03b1/Fe] = 0, our CMD\nfor NGC 7789 favors an isochrone with t = 1.4 Gyr. The\nresulting fit to the entire main-sequence and turnoff is\ngood, although the cluster red giants are bluer than the\nmodel prediction. We note that VandenBerg, Bergbusch,\n& Dowler (2006) also found this discrepancy when fitting\nan older photometric data set (V , I) of this cluster (observed by Gim et al. 1998). The cause of this mismatch\nmay be in part related to the masses of these red giant stars, which, given the age of NGC 7789, should be\nvery close to the phase transition threshold where the\nevolution is terminated by degenerate helium ignition in\nthe core (i.e., the flash). Modeling this transition depends sensitively on the extent of core overshooting. For\nNGC 6819, we find that an isochrone of age t = 2.5 Gyr\n\n5\n\nFig. 4.- The 28 white dwarf candidates that are spectroscopically targeted in NGC 7789 and NGC 6819 are highlighted in the\nfaint-blue corner of the cluster CMDs. These objects are scattered\naround a 0.6 M\u2299 cooling sequence (Wood 1995) and span approximately three magnitudes of the white dwarf cooling sequence in\neach cluster.\n\nreproduces all of the main CMD features very nicely.\nThis includes the main-sequence, turnoff, and red giant\nbranch. For both clusters, the ages determined from the\nVandenBerg, Bergbusch, & Dowler (2006) isochrones are\nconsistent at the \u223c10% level with those determined from\neither the Yale-Yonsei isochrones (Demarque et al. 2004)\nor the Padova group isochrones (Girardi et al. 2002).\nTo summarize the analysis of the cluster CMDs, our\nbest parameters are E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.28 \u00b1 0.02, (m \u2212 M )V\n= 12.5 \u00b1 0.1, Z = 0.014, and t = 1.4 Gyr for NGC 7789.\nFor NGC 6819, we find E(B\u2212V ) = 0.13 \u00b1 0.02, (m\u2212M )V\n= 12.30 \u00b1 0.12, Z = 0.017, and t = 2.5 Gyr. We point out\nthat these age derivations are sensitive to the input parameters. A reasonable fit to the observed CMDs can be\nachieved by tweaking the age by \u223c10% with corresponding changes to the reddening, distance moduli, and/or\nmetallicity. Although we can not be absolutely certain\nwhich combination of these parameters are correct for\nthe clusters (given the ranges reported in the literature),\nwe are reasonably sure that our estimates are accurate\nas they agree with most recent literature values. It is\nalso reassuring that, for this set of parameters, the models reproduce the lower main sequences nearly perfectly\n(this phase has never been tested before).\n4. KECK SPECTROSCOPY\n\nSpectroscopic observations of NGC 7789 and\nNGC 6819 were obtained using the LRIS multiobject spectrograph on the Keck I telescope on July 29\nand July 30 2005. The instrument is a dual-beam, low\nresolution spectrograph with a 5\u2032 \u00d7 7\u2032 field of view (Oke\net al. 1995). For the blue side, we used the 600/4000\ngrism (dispersion = 0.63 \u00c5/pixel) which simultaneously\ncovers 2580 \u00c5, from 3300 \u2013 5880 \u00c5. The plate scale of\nthe blue CCD is 0.\u2032\u2032 135 per pixel. For the red side, we\nused the 600/7500 grating (dispersion = 1.28 \u00c5/pixel),\ncentered at 6600 \u00c5, which covers a wavelength baseline\n\n\f6\n\nKalirai et al.\n\nFig. 5.- The images of each of our white dwarf candidates are shown from the V -band CFHT data. Each star is displayed in a small\nwindow that extends approximately 1 arcminute in the E-W direction (E is to the left) and 35 arcseconds in the N-S direction (N is to the\ntop). By design, most of the white dwarf candidates are well isolated, sharp sources. Higher resolution version of this figure is available at\nhttp://www.ucolick.org/\u223cjkalirai/0706.3894/.\n\nof 2620 \u00c5. The plate scale of the red CCD is 0.\u2032\u2032 210\nper pixel. The light to the blue side was intercepted\nfrom the collimator mirror using the D560 dichroic.\nIn multiobject slit spectroscopy, the exact wavelength\ncoverage for each target varies somewhat depending on\nthe location of that target on the mask.\nWe do not a priori know which of the faint-blue stars\nidentified as white dwarf candidates from the imaging\nobservations are in fact white dwarfs. Unresolved background galaxies, QSOs, hot subdwarfs, and even distant\nearly type main-sequence stars can contaminate the sample. However, NGC 7789 and NGC 6819 are two of the\nrichest Milky Way open star clusters and therefore the\npercentage of contaminating field objects is suppressed.\nIn fact, Figure 1 shows that both clusters exhibit obvious\nwhite dwarf cooling sequences which would not be otherwise discernible if field contamination was overwhelming.\nWe also note that similar studies by our group of the rich\ncluster NGC 2099 (Kalirai et al. 2005a) and NGC 6791\n(Kalirai et al. 2007) have confirmed that most faint-blue\nobjects in our CFHT CMDs for these rich systems are in\nfact cluster white dwarf members.\nWe generate an input list of spectroscopic targets by\nassigning priorities to objects in the CFHT CMD based\non their magnitudes and morphology (i.e., extended\nsources with a poor \"stellarity\" are removed \u2013 Bertin\n& Arnouts 1996). Objects that are near the bright white\n\ndwarf cooling sequence (defined by eye, see Figure 1) in\neach cluster are given high priorities and objects that are\nfainter are given lower priorities. Since the LRIS field of\nview is much smaller than our wide-field CFHT image,\nwe strategically position the spectroscopic mask to overlap as many of the best targets as we can. Our expectation was to observe a single field in each of the clusters\nto maximize the S/N of the resulting spectra, which is\ncritical to derive accurate masses (see \u00a7 6). However, we\ngenerated spectroscopic masks at two different locations\nin case a quick reduction of the data from the first exposure taken at the telescope revealed that most of the\ntargets were not white dwarfs. In this case, we had the\noption to abandon further exposures of that particular\nfield and switch to the second mask which targeted a\ndifferent region of the cluster.\nFor each mask location discussed above (and similarly\ntwo locations in NGC 6819), we milled two masks with\nindividual slit widths of 0.\u2032\u2032 8 and 1.\u2032\u2032 0, and orientations\nclose to the parallactic angle. The choice between the\ntwo masks was made dependent on the seeing conditions\nof the observations. The individual exposure times were\nset to 30 \u2013 60 minutes for a total integration of 6.8 hours\non NGC 7789 (one exposure was cut short) and 5 hours\non NGC 6819. The airmass of the observations ranged\nfrom 1.25 \u2013 1.49 for the NGC 7789 spectra and from\n1.07 \u2013 1.22 for the NGC 6819 spectra.

In total,\nthe NGC 7789 spectroscopic field contained 15 targets,\n9 of which were top priority white dwarf candidates. For\nNGC 6819, 13 objects were targeted in the one mask of\nwhich 8 were top priority candidate white dwarfs. Additional box slits were used for alignment. The locations\nof these 28 selected white dwarf candidates on the faintblue corners of the cluster CMDs are displayed in Figure 4, for each of NGC 7789 and NGC 6819. We have\nalso introduced a numbering scheme to identify these objects later (i.e., object \"1\" in NGC 7789 is labeled as\nNGC 7789 \u2013 1). The selected objects sample the observed white dwarf cooling sequence over approximately\nthree magnitudes, in each cluster. The solid curve represents a 0.6 M\u2299 white dwarf cooling sequence (Wood\n1995). Postage-stamp cutouts of each of the 28 white\ndwarf candidates from the CFHT imaging are shown in\nFigure 5 and the photometric properties of these stars\nare summarized in Table 2.\nThe spectroscopic data were analyzed as described\nin Kalirai et al. (2007). Specifically, we used Python\nroutines that are described in Kelson et al. (2000) and\nKelson (2003) to perform bias subtraction, vertical distortion corrections, wavelength calibration (typical rms\nscatter in the dispersion solutions is <0.05 \u00c5), flat-field\ncorrections, and sky subtraction. Standard IRAF tasks\nwere used to extract these to 1-d spectra, co-add individual exposures, and flux calibrate using a spectrophotometric standard star (HZ 44).

NGC 7789 AND NGC 6819 WHITE DWARF SPECTRA\n\nThe spectra for the 27 extracted white dwarf candidates targeted in this study are shown in Figures 6 and\n7. The majority of the 27 targets show clear evidence for\npressure broadened Balmer lines and are therefore DA\n(hydrogen atmosphere) white dwarfs. The top group of\nten white dwarfs in Figure 6 represent our highest quality data, and will be used in the analysis that follows.\nThese stars are clearly among the brightest in our data\nset and the spectra reveal well defined Balmer lines from\nH\u03b2 down to H8 and H9. We discuss these objects further\nin section 6.\n5.1. Rare White Dwarfs\n\nThe second set of targets in Figure 6 (bottom) represent three rare objects in our sample. Each of these\nstars is potentially very important (for different reasons)\nand so we discuss them in turn. The first, object 4 in\nNGC 6819, is clearly a DB (helium atmosphere) white\ndwarf. He absorption lines at 3889, 4471, and 4713 \u00c5\nare all seen in the stellar spectrum (see three panels on\nthe right in Figure 6 for a closer look at these features).\nIf a member of the cluster, this star therefore represents\none of only four helium atmosphere white dwarfs found\nin all open clusters. The other such stars are the DBA\n\n\f8\n\nKalirai et al.\n\nFig. 6.- Top \u2013 Keck/LRIS spectra for ten stars with at least five well characterized Balmer lines. Each of these stars can be fit to models\nto yield accurate temperatures and gravities (see section 6). Bottom \u2013 The spectra of three unique white dwarfs (left) and a closer look\nat their absorption lines (NGC 6819 \u2013 4 and 8, and NGC 7789 \u2013 7 \u2013 right). NGC 6819 \u2013 4 shows the presence of He lines at 3889, 4471,\nand 4713 \u00c5 and is therefore a DB (helium atmosphere) white dwarf. NGC 6819 \u2013 8 shows obvious signatures of very broad H\u03b2 and H\u03b3\nBalmer lines with possible Zeeman splitting, but no clear evidence of higher order Balmer lines. This star looks to be a massive, magnetic\nwhite dwarf. The spectrum of NGC 7789 \u2013 7 shows both hydrogen and helium absorption lines. These objects are discussed further in\nsection 5.1.\n\nwhite dwarf LP 475-242 in the Hyades, the DQ white\ndwarf NGC 2168:LAWDS 28 in NGC 2168 (Williams\net al. 2006), and the newly discovered DB white dwarf\nNGC 6633:LAWDS 16 in NGC 6633 (Williams & Bolte\n2007). Unfortunately, the spectral quality of NGC 6819 \u2013\n4 is too low to estimate the temperature or mass of the\nstar from the helium lines. Kalirai et al. (2005b) proposed that the absence of DBs in open clusters may be\nrelated to the fact that this population of white dwarfs\nis more massive than the field population (where we typically find 20\u201325% DBs). This results from the targeting of younger clusters in previous studies (more massive\nprogenitor stars) that have only produced massive white\ndwarfs. Such hot, high mass white dwarfs may not develop large enough helium convection zones to allow helium to be brought to the surface and turn a hydrogenrich white dwarf into a helium-rich one. Kalirai et al.\npredicted that an increasing number of DB white dwarfs\nshould be seen as observations begin to probe older clusters, such as NGC 6819 and NGC 7789.\nThe second object, NGC 6819 \u2013 8 shows very broad\nH\u03b2 and H\u03b3 absorption lines but an absence of higher order Balmer lines. Although the spectral quality is not\n\nhigh enough to absolutely rule out the presence of weak\nhigher order lines, this signature may suggest that the\nwhite dwarf is quite massive (see section 6 for more information). Furthermore, there is evidence for Zeeman\nsplitting of the lines (see two panels on the right) and\ntherefore this object is likely a magnetic white dwarf (see\ne.g., Liebert, Bergeron, & Holberg 2003). Again, the\nquality of the spectrum is too poor to estimate the magnetic field or the stellar mass and therefore it would be\nuseful to obtain higher S/N spectral observations of this\nstar. Additionally, a reduction of the red side spectrum\nfrom LRIS may shed further light on this interesting object. Given the poor quality, we also speculate whether\nthe observed splitting may actually represent emission in\nthe core of the Balmer absorption lines, in which case\nthis object may be a binary system in which the primary is accreting material from the secondary star. If\nthe primary is massive enough, such a system could be a\npotential type Ia supernova progenitor. Hurley & Shara\n(2003) speculated that this cluster contains a large fraction of white dwarfs that once had binary companions, in\naddition to double degenerates, to reproduce the scatter\nalong the cooling sequence. Note, the image of this star\n\n\fThe Initial-Final Mass Relation\n\n9\n\nFig. 7.- Top \u2013 Spectra for nine fainter white dwarfs in our data set. These spectra are too noisy to accurately characterize the shapes\nof the higher order Balmer lines and therefore can not be used to yield accurate temperatures and gravities for the stars. All of the stars\ncan, however, be classified as DA white dwarfs. Bottom \u2013 Spectra for five objects of likely non-white dwarf nature as discussed in \u00a7 5.2).\n\ndoes not show any nearby companions (see Figure 5).\nInterestingly, object 7 in NGC 7789 shows both hydrogen and helium lines in its spectrum. These are again\nhighlighted in the three panels showing different wavelength regions (Figure 6 \u2013 bottom-right). At lower wavelengths, the first panel shows hydrogen lines at 3970 and\n4101 \u00c5 (H\u01eb and H\u03b4) as well as helium lines at 3889 and\n4026 \u00c5. In the middle panels H\u03b3 is seen at 4340 \u00c5 as\nwell as two helium lines at 4388 and 4471 \u00c5. At longer\nwavelengths (3rd panel), H\u03b2 is visible at 4861 \u00c5 as well\nas three more helium lines at 4713, 4922, and 5016 \u00c5.\nThis object(s) is therefore either a single DAB (mixed\nhydrogen and helium atmosphere) white dwarf or a double degenerate (i.e., unresolved white dwarf - white dwarf\nbinary) consisting of both a DA and a DB (helium atmosphere) star. Distinguishing between these two cases\nis very difficult without a much higher S/N spectrum of\nthis target (see e.g., Bergeron & Liebert 2002). Both\ncases are very interesting. DAB white dwarfs are rare\nand can shed light on diffusion processes in white dwarfs\nand help our understanding of the chemical evolution of\nthese stars. If this object is in fact a binary, then the discovery of the DB white dwarf would in fact represent the\nfifth helium atmosphere white dwarf in an open cluster\n(see above for the other four such stars). The image of\nthis source in Figure 5 does show two nearby neighbors\n\nhowever both of these other stars are red main sequence\ndwarfs and therefore can not account for the contaminant.\n5.2. Lower Quality White Dwarf Spectra\n\nand Other Objects\nIn Figure 7 (top) we present spectra of fainter DA\nwhite dwarfs in our data set. These spectra are too noisy\nto yield accurate spectroscopic masses and therefore we\nwill ignore them in the subsequent analysis. However, it\nis reassuring that most of the faint blue targets in our\nspectroscopic study are in fact white dwarfs. First, this\nsuggests that our target selection process in these rich\nclusters is efficient. As mentioned earlier, we also found\na high success rate in our study of NGC 2099 (Kalirai\net al. 2005a) and NGC 6791 (Kalirai et al. 2007). Second, these fainter white dwarfs can be followed up with\nfuture observations to improve the S/N of the spectra\nand therefore may eventually be important in placing\nconstraints on the initial-final mass relation. The faintest\nwhite dwarfs may even represent descendents from more\nmassive main-sequence stars and therefore allow a probe\nof the relation over a mass range, within a given cluster.\nAt the bottom of Figure 7 are spectra for five other\nobjects along our line of sight. The most interesting case\nis NGC 6819 \u2013 3 which exhibits the hydrogen Balmer se-\n\n\f10\n\nKalirai et al.\n\nFig. 8.- The best fit hydrogen atmosphere model white dwarf spectrum (red curve) is shown for each of the ten stars in Figure 6 (top).\nWithin each of the panels, the hydrogen Balmer lines for a single star are arranged with H\u03b2 at the bottom and successively higher order\nlines towards the top. The model shown represents the fit with the lowest \u03c72 to all lines simultaneously. As discussed in section 6, these\nfits provide accurate measurements of both Teff and log g (and therefore the stellar mass) for each white dwarf (see Table 3).\n\nries although the lines are not pressure broadened. This\nobject is therefore either a field horizontal branch star,\nor a distant main-sequence dwarf of spectral type late A\nor early F. If the latter, the observed magnitude of the\nstar (V = 21.9) implies a distance of \u223c80 kpc. Similarly,\nNGC 6819 \u2013 11 and 5 appear to be background dwarfs of\nlater spectral type. The other two spectra lack enough\nsignal to accurately classify the objects. These could be\ncool DA white dwarfs, DB or DC white dwarfs, or other\nobjects along the line of sight such as unresolved blue\ngalaxies.\nOverall, our spectra confirm that 22 of the 27 targets\nfor which we extracted a spectrum are in fact white dwarf\nstars. We now proceed to analyze further the six white\ndwarfs in NGC 7789 and four white dwarfs in NGC 6819\nthat show well characterized Balmer lines (i.e., the top\ngroup in Figure 6).\n6. THE MASSES OF WHITE DWARFS IN\nNGC 7789 AND NGC 6819\n\nSeveral techniques exist to measure the masses of white\ndwarfs, depending on what information is available. If\nthe star is in a binary system, a dynamical mass estimate can be easily calculated from the orbit of the two\nstars. For example, the nearest white dwarf Sirius B was\nknown to exist as early as 1841 from its dynamical influences on the optically brighter companion, Sirius A\n(Bessel 1844). The optical detection of the white dwarf\ndid not occur until 1862 (by Alvan Clark), shortly after\nwhich the star was known to be a \u223c1 solar mass ob-\n\nject from the period of the binary (\u223c50 years). For a\nwhite dwarf with a known radial velocity, the gravitational redshift method can also be used to measure the\nstellar mass (e.g., Adams 1925; Wegner 1989; Reid 1996).\nGiven the large gravity, photons from the surface of the\nwhite dwarf will lose energy as they escape the potential\nof the star and therefore be redshifted (as first suggested\nby Michell 1784). To measure this effect, the H\u03b1 Balmer\nline at 6563 \u00c5 is typically observed at intermediate resolution. Other methods to measure white dwarf masses\nare applicable to smaller subsets of stars only, e.g., pulsation mode analysis of very hot white dwarfs (Kawaler\n1991) and fits to the mass-radius relation for stars with\ntrigonometric parallaxes (Koester, Schulz, & Weidemann\n1979).\nThe most widely adopted technique for measuring the\nmass of a white dwarf involves fitting the Balmer lines of\nthe spectrum to model atmospheres (Bergeron, Saffer, &\nLiebert 1992). The shapes of these line profiles depends\nsensitively on changes in the temperature (Teff ) and surface gravity (log g) of the star. For example, as the atmospheric pressure in a white dwarf increases (e.g., due to a\nlarger surface gravity), interactions between neighboring\nhydrogen atoms will lead to enhanced Stark broadening.\nFor the lower order Balmer lines, this means the profiles\nwill become broader (e.g., H\u03b2 and H\u03b3). However, the\nbluer Balmer lines are produced by electron transitions\nat higher energy levels and therefore these lines will be\nthe first to be destroyed by the increased perturbations\n\n\fThe Initial-Final Mass Relation\non the atom (e.g., H\u01eb, H8, H9, etc...). As an example of\nthis, see Figure 3 in Bergeron, Saffer, & Liebert (1992).\nTherefore, using this technique to accurately define the\nTeff and log g of a white dwarf requires the characterization of higher order Balmer lines in the stellar spectrum.\nFor faint stars, this implies the need for a blue-sensitive\nspectrograph as the wavelength of H\u01eb is in the violet region, 3970 \u00c5. With Teff and log g constrained, the mass\nof the star can be obtained through a mass-radius relation.\nA significant sample of white dwarfs has been observed\nusing at least two of these techniques (including the\nspectroscopic Balmer line fitting technique) and therefore provide a means to independently check the accuracy of the method. Bergeron, Liebert, & Fulbright\n(1995) analyze 35 such white dwarfs and find a reasonable agreement between spectroscopic mass determinations and gravitational redshifts for only those stars with\nTeff > 12,000 K. For the cooler stars, the spectroscopic\nmass determinations are systematically larger than the\ngravitational redshifts by \u223c0.1 M\u2299 . As pointed out by\nBergeron, Liebert, & Fulbright (1995), these measurements could be in error if convection has set in and polluted the atmospheres of these cool stars with helium\n(i.e., this would mimic a larger mass). A similar study by\nReid (1996) based on HIRES spectra of 53 white dwarfs\nalso found good agreement between these two methods\nfor white dwarfs with Teff > 14,000 K (see also Claver\net al. 2001). Finally, a recent study with HST/STIS has\nmade it possible to calculate the mass of Sirius B using\nthree independent techniques (Barstow et al. 2005). The\nmass of the white dwarf based on its orbit, gravitational\nredshift, and blue Balmer lines, all indicate that the star\nis one solar mass to within a few percent. As we show below, all but one of our white dwarfs have Teff > 13,000 K\nand therefore the spectroscopic mass measurements are\nnot affected by any of these possible systematic errors.\nThe fitting technique to derive Teff and log g is described in Bergeron, Saffer, & Liebert (1992). We convolved the models with a Gaussian profile with FWHM\n= 4 \u00c5 to match the resolution of our spectra. All of\nthe available Balmer lines of each star are fit simultaneously and the best fit solution is converged upon by\nminimizing \u03c72 using the nonlinear least-squares method\nof Levenberg-Marquardt (Press, Flannery, & Teukolsky 1986). In this fit, the estimation of the continuum near each Balmer line is performed using the upgraded method described in Liebert, Bergeron, & Holberg (2005). The atmosphere models cover a log g range\nfrom 6.5 \u2013 9.0 and a Teff range from 1500 \u2013 100,000 K.\nThe best solutions for the ten white dwarfs in NGC 7789\nand NGC 6819 are illustrated in Figure 8. For each star,\nwe present the observed Balmer lines one on top of another, with H\u03b2 at the bottom and subsequent higher order lines at the top (up to H9 at 3835 \u00c5). The best\nfit model solution for each is shown as a smooth profile\n(red curve). The fits are excellent in all cases except for\nNGC 6819 \u2013 2 in which the lower order Balmer lines are\nnot reproduced as well as the higher order lines. If we\nignore the higher order lines of this star and refit only\nH\u03b2, H\u03b3, and H\u03b4, the quality of the fit does not improve\nand the derived parameters of the star remain essentially\nunchanged. As we below show in section 7.1, this star is\nnot a cluster member and therefore does not enter into\n\n11\n\nour analysis of the initial-final mass relation.\nWhite dwarf masses (Mfinal ) are calculated for each\nstar by interpolating the Teff and log g within the updated evolutionary models of Fontaine, Brassard, &\nBergeron (2001) for a 50/50 carbon-oxygen core mix.\nThe models adopt thick hydrogen layers (q(H) = MH /M\n= 10\u22124 ) and helium layers of q(He) = 10\u22122 . The models also provide white dwarf cooling ages (tcool ) for each\nstar (i.e., the age of the star since shell helium burning\nfinished on the asymptotic giant branch). We summarize the spectroscopic properties for these twelve white\ndwarfs in Table 3.\n7. CALCULATING MAIN-SEQUENCE PROGENITOR\nLIFETIMES AND MASSES\n\nUnlike for the field population of isolated white dwarfs,\nthe environments of white dwarfs in star clusters can\nbe used to shed light on the properties of their progenitors. As star clusters are co-eval, the main-sequence\nturnoff ages of NGC 7789 and NGC 6819 measured in\nsection 3.1 also represent the total lifetime of their inhabiting white dwarfs (i.e., the main-sequence lifetime plus\nthe timescales for evolutionary stages beyond core hydrogen burning). Therefore, by subtracting the white dwarf\ncooling age from the cluster age, we can calculate the\nlifetime of the progenitor star that made the white dwarf\nup to the tip of the asymptotic giant branch. For clusters as old as NGC 7789 and NGC 6819, this latter age\n(tms ) is dominated by the main-sequence lifetime of the\nstar since the post main-sequence evolutionary phases\nare short lived.\n7.1. Cluster Membership\nThe assumption in the above calculation is that the\nspectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs in this study\nare in fact members of NGC 7789 and NGC 6819. As the\nvolume probed increases with photometric depth, most\nof the field white dwarfs along these lines of sight will be\nfound near the faint end of the data set. Depending on\nthe distance and age of any field white dwarf, it could\nmimic itself as a faint-blue cluster object.\nTo determine which of the stars are likely cluster white\ndwarfs, we use the white dwarf mass-radius relation to\ncalculate a theoretical magnitude for each star. This\nmagnitude is next compared to the observed brightness\nof the respective white dwarf by adopting the distance\nmodulus of each cluster derived in section 3.1 ((m\u2212 M )V\n= 12.5 \u00b1 0.1 for NGC 7789 and (m \u2212 M )V = 12.30 \u00b1\n0.12 for NGC 6819). Figure 9 shows the results. The\nsolid line represents the 1:1 relation and the dashed lines\nare 2\u03c3 bounds based on the distance errors above. The\nuncertainties on the data points are also 2\u03c3 error bars.\nIn NGC 7789, a group of four white dwarfs are found\nnear the 1:1 relation, and two others are obvious outliers (objects 1 and 2). Based on this diagram, only objects 5 and 8 can be considered isolated cluster members\n(darker points). However, we note that both objects 4\nand 6 are consistent with a 0.75 magnitude offset from\nthe 1:1 relation (observed magnitude being too bright\n\u2013 dotted line). These stars are therefore overluminous\nby an amount consistent with an equal mass binary nature (i.e., they could be unresolved double degenerates in\nthe cluster), assuming they are not optical binaries. For\nNGC 6819, Figure 9 indicates that objects 6 and 7 are\n\n\f12\n\nKalirai et al.\n\nFig. 9.- A comparison of the theoretical magnitude of the\nstar (from fitting the Balmer lines) with the observed brightness\nindicates that two of the white dwarfs in both NGC 7789 and\nNGC 6819 are single white dwarfs (darker objects) in these clusters\n(2\u03c3 error bars). An additional two objects in NGC 7789, objects 4\nand 6, are consistent with being 0.75 magnitudes overluminous and\ntherefore may represent unresolved double degenerate systems.\n\ncluster members whereas objects 1 and 2 are classified as\nnon members based on our parameter measurements.\nFor the four non-binary cluster member stars and the\ntwo potential double degenerate systems, we measure the\nmain-sequence plus post main-sequence lifetimes (up to\nthe tip of the asymptotic giant branch) by subtracting\nthe derived white dwarf cooling ages from the cluster\nages (t = 1.4 Gyr for NGC 7789 and t = 2.5 Gyr for\nNGC 6819 \u2013 see section 3.1). These results, tms , are\ngiven in column 7 of Table 3. The main-sequence masses\n(Minitial ) follow from the models of Hurley, Pols, & Tout\n(2000) and are listed in column 8 of Table 3. The errors\nin the main-sequence lifetimes include the uncertainties\nin the cooling ages and an assumed 10% uncertainty in\nthe ages of the clusters.\n8. THE INITIAL-FINAL MASS RELATION\n8.1. Constraining the Low Mass End\n\nWe stressed earlier the importance of a well constrained\ninitial-final mass relation over a wide mass range. Star\nformation in the Universe leads to an initial mass function that is generally steep (i.e., many more low mass\nstars are produced as compared to high mass stars\n\u2013 Salpeter 1955; Miller & Scalo 1979; Kroupa 2002).\nWe illustrate a simple mass function with a Salpeter\nslope in Figure 10 (top), for 1000 stars over a mass\nrange of 0.8 \u2013 7 M\u2299 . These limits have been chosen\nas they range from the lowest mass stars that could\nhave formed white dwarfs over the age of the Universe\n(\u223c0.8 M\u2299 ) to the most massive such stars (\u223c7 M\u2299 ).\nIn the bottom panel, we illustrate the initial-final mass\nrelation with all constraints over the past 30 years\n(crosses). This includes white dwarfs in the Hyades,\nPraesepe, and Pleiades clusters (Claver et al. 2001; Dobbie et al. 2004, 2006), NGC 3532 (Koester & Reimers\n1993), NGC 2516 (Koester & Reimers 1996), NGC 2168\n\nFig. 10.- Top \u2013 For a Salpeter mass function only 13% of\nall stars are formed with M > 2.75 M\u2299 whereas 55% have M >\n1.16 M\u2299 . Bottom \u2013 All previous constraints on the initial final mass\nrelation (crosses \u2013 see references in \u00a7 8.1) and weighted averages\nfor the stars in this study (filled circles) from NGC 7789 (Minitial\n= 2.03 M\u2299 ) and NGC 6819 (Minitial = 1.61 M\u2299 ), as well as the\nmasses of the single carbon-oxygen core white dwarf and progenitor\nin NGC 6791 (Minitial = 1.16 M\u2299 ). The uncertainties on these\nthree points represent 2\u03c3 errors. The new data extend the initialfinal mass relation to very low masses and show that the observed\ntrend at higher masses continues down to stars approximately the\nmass of the Sun. The two curves are the core mass at the first\nthermal pulse (solid) and the solar metallicity theoretical initial\nfinal mass relation (dotted) from Marigo (2001).\n\n(Williams, Bolte, & Koester 2004), NGC 2099 (Kalirai\net al. 2005a), NGC 6633 (Williams & Bolte 2007), and\nSirius B (Liebert et al. 2005). Initial and final masses\nare taken from Table 1 in Ferrario et al. (2005). The\nonly stars ignored in this analysis are four white dwarfs\nin young clusters with masses <0.55 M\u2299 that likely represent field contamination (e.g., see Kalirai et al. 2005a\nfor NGC 2099) and two stars with >90% uncertainties in\ntheir initial masses (star 3532-10 in NGC 3532 and 2099WD16 in NGC 2099). Over the region where information is available (Minitial > 2.75 M\u2299 \u2013 right dashed line),\nthe relation shows a trend indicating that more massive\nmain-sequence stars produce more massive white dwarfs.\nIntegrating the Salpeter mass function above this limit,\nwe find that only 13% of all stars are born with masses\nthis large over the 0.8 \u2013 7 M\u2299 mass range. Therefore,\nthe present initial-final mass relation can not be directly\nused to infer progenitor properties for almost all white\ndwarfs in the Galactic disk and halo.\nThe 2.75 M\u2299 lower initial mass limit on the relation\nresults purely from an observational limitation. A low\nmass (0.6 M\u2299 ), bright white dwarf has MV \u223c 11 at an\nage of \u223c100 Myr. At a distance of 1.5 kpc, this translates\nto an observed magnitude of V \u223c 22.

These clusters have ages of a few\nhundred Myr and therefore are not old enough to have\nallowed the evolution of lower mass stars off the main\nsequence.\nThe masses of white dwarfs in systems such as\nNGC 7789 and NGC 6819 present us the opportunity\nto extend the mass range over which the initial-final\nmass relation has been studied. The younger of our\ntwo clusters, NGC 7789, has an age of 1.4 Gyr. The\nmain-sequence turnoff of this system is therefore 2.0 M\u2299\n(VandenBerg, Bergbusch, & Dowler 2006) and most of\nthe cluster white dwarfs will have evolved from stars just\nabove this mass (again, due to the slope of the mass function). The age of NGC 6819 is 2.5 Gyr and therefore\nthe present day turnoff mass is 1.6 M\u2299 . The progenitor\nmasses for the confirmed white dwarfs in each cluster are\nindeed very similar to one another, and just above the\nturnoff masses (see Minitial in Table 3).\nWe can also add data from the very old cluster\nNGC 6791 to the initial-final mass relation. At an age\nof 8.5 Gyr, this system represents one of the oldest open\nstar clusters and has a main-sequence turnoff mass of\n\u223c1.1 M\u2299 . Kalirai et al. (2007) present evidence that a\nsignificant population of white dwarfs in this cluster resulted from progenitors that expelled enough mass on the\nred giant branch to avoid the helium flash, and therefore\nthe white dwarfs have helium cores rather than carbonoxygen cores. This is believed to be a result of the high\nmetallicity of the system, [Fe/H] = +0.4. The mean mass\nof the nine cluster white dwarfs targeted in that study\nis hM i = 0.43 M\u2299 . The threshold at which a heliumcore white dwarf is produced at NGC 6791's metallicity\nis 0.45 \u2013 0.47 M\u2299 , and therefore to be conservative, we\nconsider only the single confirmed cluster member with\na mass >0.50 M\u2299 (definite carbon-oxygen core white\ndwarf). This object, NGC 6791 WD 7, has Minitial =\n1.16+0.04\n\u22120.03 and Mfinal = 0.53 \u00b1 0.02 M\u2299 (see Kalirai et al.\n2007 for the spectral fits). The initial mass for this star\nhas been calculated using the same Hurley, Pols, & Tout\n(2000) models as for NGC 7789 and NGC 6819, for Z =\n0.035 (the highest metallicity available in these models).\nWe note that this data point may still represent a lower\nlimit (i.e., the final mass) since the progenitor star of the\n\ncarbon-oxygen core white dwarf also likely suffered from\nenhanced mass loss. The weighted mean progenitor mass\nand white dwarf mass for the two stars in NGC 7789, the\ntwo stars in NGC 6819, and the masses of the single object in NGC 6791 are\nMinitial = 2.02 \u00b1 0.07 M\u2299 , Mfinal = 0.61 \u00b1 0.02 M\u2299\nMinitial = 1.61 \u00b1 0.04 M\u2299 , Mfinal = 0.54 \u00b1 0.01 M\u2299\nMinitial = 1.16 \u00b1 0.04 M\u2299 , Mfinal = 0.53 \u00b1 0.02 M\u2299 .\nWe illustrate these new points as filled circles on the\ninitial-final mass relation in Figure 10 (bottom). The\ncalculated initial progenitor masses (for bright white\ndwarfs) in these much older clusters are all essentially\nthe same as the cooling ages are a very small fraction\nof the cluster ages. We have therefore plotted one data\npoint for each cluster, which for the two clusters with\nmultiple white dwarfs, represents the weighted mean of\nthe system's progenitor and white dwarf masses. Also\nshown is the 2\u03c3 error in each quantity for all three clusters (see section 8.4 for more information on this). As expected, these new data points provide constraints on the\nlow mass end of the relation. They clearly indicate that\nthe observed trend at higher masses (suggesting more\nmassive main-sequence stars produce more massive white\ndwarfs) continues down to stars that are roughly one solar mass.\n8.2. Theoretical Estimates of Stellar Mass Loss\n\nMost of the mass loss that a star suffers through its evolution occurs during very short lived post-main-sequence\nevolutionary phases such as the red giant branch, asymptotic giant branch, and planetary nebula phases (e.g., see\nReimers 1975). In fact, it is the mass loss that is responsible for concluding fusion processes in the star and hence\nits rise in luminosity on the asymptotic giant branch.\nIn principal, the masses of the stellar cores during these\nlast phases of stellar evolution can be determined directly\nfrom modeling these evolutionary stages. An ideal model\nwould then take an initial star of a certain mass (M .\n8 M\u2299 ) and propagate it through all phases of stellar evolution to yield a remnant white dwarf with a particular\nmass. In practice, this has been very difficult because\nthe mass loss mechanisms (e.g., helium flash and thermal\npulses on the asymptotic giant branch) are not theoretically understood well enough (Weidemann 2000; also see\n\n\f14\n\nKalirai et al.\nfinal mass relation to highlight the desired output from\nthis work. The vertical axis now shows the total integrated mass loss through stellar evolution. For the most\nmassive main-sequence stars that will form white dwarfs,\nthis yield is about \u223c85% (e.g., the progenitor of white\ndwarf LB1497 in the Pleiades cluster). A slightly less\nmassive star such as the progenitor of Sirius B (5.06 M\u2299\n\u2013 Liebert et al. 2005) has lost 80% of its mass. The\nmass loss smoothly decreases with stellar mass down to\n\u223c75% for intermediate mass stars, 3 < Minitial < 4 M\u2299 .\nOur new data points suggest a more rapid decline for\nstars with M . 2 M\u2299 . At this mass, stars will lose\n\u223c70% of their total mass however this decreases down to\njust \u223c55% for stars approximately the mass of the Sun.\nThe theoretical calculation for solar metallicity discussed\nabove is shown as the uppermost dotted curve (Marigo\n2001).\n8.3. The Scatter in the Relation\n\nFig. 11.- The total integrated mass loss is found to decrease as\nthe initial mass of the star decreases. The new data points from\nthis study, with 2\u03c3 error bars, are shown as filled circles. The dotted lines are theoretical calculations from Marigo (2001) for solar\nmetallicity (top), Z = 0.008 (middle), and Z = 0.004 (bottom).\nThe solid curve is the best fit linear least squares parameterization\nof the initial-final mass relation from this work (see section 8.4).\n\nHabing 1996 for a review). Direct observational constraints are rare given the very short lifetimes of stars on\nthe asymptotic giant branch and planetary nebula phases\n(\u223c105 years), and heavy obscuration of sources by dusty\nshells.\nRecently, a few attempts have been made to calculate\nthe rate of mass loss in asymptotic giant branch stars\nafter factoring in parameters such as metallicity (e.g.,\nMarigo 2001). We first present the mass of the stellar\ncore at the first thermal pulse from one such calculation\nas a solid line in the bottom panel of Figure 10 (Girardi\net al. 2000). As expected, this curve falls below the bulk\nof the data points as it represents an evolutionary point\nbefore the core of the star has had a chance to grow\nduring the thermal pulses. Note that the mass of the\ncore is roughly constant for masses below 2 M\u2299 . From\nthis initial point, Marigo (2001) performs synthetic calculations of the subsequent thermally pulsating phases of\nthe asymptotic giant branch until the star has completely\nejected its envelope (see details in her paper). This can\ntherefore be used to predict both the total mass loss and\nspecific chemical yields as a function of initial mass and\nmetallicity. For solar metallicity, the theoretical initialfinal mass relation from this work is shown as the dotted\nline in Figure 10 (bottom). For Minitial > 4 M\u2299 , this\ncurve is systematically higher than the observed data,\npredicting final remnant masses that are too large by up\nto 0.1 M\u2299 . A test of this relation at the low mass end\n(i.e., the new data points with M . 2 M\u2299 ) also finds\nfinal masses that are larger than our observations, however, the differences are very small. Part of this difference may even be expected in the case of NGC 6791 given\nthe 2.5\u00d7 higher metallicity of this cluster as compared\nto the solar metallicity theoretical relation (see earlier\ndiscussion).\nIn Figure 11 we present a different view of the initial-\n\nSeveral authors have commented on the observed scatter in the initial-final mass relation (e.g., Ferrario et al.\n2005). The present data set is very heterogeneous. The\npoints on Figure 10 are derived from white dwarf observations in over ten star clusters. The quality of these\ndata and procedures used to fit the spectra vary from\none investigation to another and therefore small biases\nare likely to exist in the Mfinal values. A small amount of\nfield contamination may even exist in the sample. Additionally, the ages of the star clusters have been derived by\ndifferent authors using different assumptions, techniques,\nand isochrones and therefore the calculations involved in\ndetermining Minitial will also have biases. Even within an\nindividual study, the large error bars in Minitial for the\nmassive stars in Figure 10 are a good example of the difficulty in assigning masses to main-sequence lifetimes (see\nFerrario et al. 2005 for a version of the relation with stars\nfrom individual clusters color coded). A small shift in the\nage of a cluster from 80 to 100 Myr results in a >0.5 M\u2299\nsystematic change in the inferred main-sequence mass at\nthe turnoff. Measuring the ages of clusters to this precision is very difficult for such young systems where the\nmorphology of the turnoff is essentially vertical on an\noptical CMD. This is of course not a large concern in\nthe study of older clusters since the turnoff can be well\ndefined and the turnoff mass does not sensitively depend\non the age.\nAlthough characterizing the errors resulting from these\nuncertainties and heterogeneities is difficult, it is important to distinguish these biases from intrinsic scatter that\nmay result from fundamental properties of stellar evolution. One way to minimize the systematic effects is to\nlimit the study of a particular question to just the constraints from a few star clusters with many white dwarfs.\nFor example, the Hyades cluster (Perryman et al. 1998) is\nof similar age to NGC 2099 (Kalirai et al. 2001c; 2005a)\nyet its chemical abundance is enriched by a factor of two\n(ZHyades = 0.025 and ZNGC 2099 = 0.013). Models of stellar evolution predict that stars of higher metallicity will\nlose mass in post main-sequence phases more efficiently\nthan stars of lower metallicity (e.g., Marigo 2001). This\nis illustrated in Figure 11. As we said above, the dotted line at the top represents the theoretical estimates\nfor mass loss in solar metallicity stars. The two dotted\nlines underneath are the same relation for more metal-\n\n\fThe Initial-Final Mass Relation\n\n15\n\n8.4. Semi-Empirical Relations and Parameterization\n\nFig. 12.- An initial-final mass relation is constructed by showing\nall of the stars from each cluster as a single data point, as labeled.\nThe best-fit linear least squares relation (solid curve) is indicated\nin the panel, and is found to provide an adequate fit to the data\n(reduced chi-squared per degree of freedom is \u03c72 = 1.2). The\ndashed curve shows the initial-final mass relation calculated by\nHansen et al. (2007) to fit the white dwarf cooling sequence of the\nglobular cluster NGC 6397 (see section 9).\n\npoor stars, Z = 0.008 and Z = 0.004 (Marigo 2001).\nFortunately, both the Hyades and NGC 2099 harbor significant white dwarf populations that have been studied\nspectroscopically. Kalirai et al. (2005a) showed that the\nmean mass of the NGC 2099 white dwarf population appears to be more massive (by \u223c10%) than the Hyades\nstars, qualitatively consistent with the expectations from\nstellar evolution (this is a 2\u03c3 effect in the mean mass\nof the populations). As already discussed, a convincing\nexample of the efficiency of mass loss on metallicity is\npresented in Kalirai et al. (2007). These cases highlight\nhow the different properties of stars may play a role in\ncontributing to the observed scatter on the initial-final\nmass relation.\nOther properties of stars may also be important in\nunderstanding the scatter in the relation, such as rotation, binary evolution, and magnetic fields (see Weidemann 2000). Unfortunately, the quality of the present\ndata does not permit a study of these effects. The mass\nloss mechanisms may themselves be stochastic to some\ndegree. For example, Reid (1996) measured masses of\nwhite dwarfs in the Praesepe cluster using gravitational\nredshifts and found a large dispersion in the remnant\nmass distribution (0.6 \u2013 0.9 M\u2299 ). An estimate of the\ninitial masses of these stars suggests that they were all\nproduced from stars of about the same mass. This would\nthen suggest that there is no singular initial-final mass\nrelation. However, Claver et al. (2001) reconcile this\npicture by suggesting that one of the outlier stars in\nthe Minitial vs. Mfinal plane of the Praesepe sample\n(LB 5893) may have formed from close binary evolution.\nA better understanding of these types of effects will require a larger data set, as we discuss below.\n\nDeriving a functional form of the initial-final mass relation from the available data is problematic for several\nreasons. First, for the reasons discussed above, such a\nparameterization may be meaningless given the uncertain degree to which second order properties of stars may\neffect their mass loss. Second, the relation is only constrained over a fraction of the total mass range that is\nof interest. Prior to this work, the low mass end of the\nrelation was completely devoid of any observations of individual white dwarfs with direct mass measurements.\nThe high mass end continues to be sparsely populated,\nthe degree to which depends on the maximum mass of a\nstar that will form a white dwarf (the current high mass\npoint is at Minitial = 6.5 M\u2299 , Ferrario et al. 2005).\nWeidemann (2000) calculates a semi-empirical initialfinal mass relation based on the available data at the\ntime. At the low mass end, his relation is constrained by\nan anchor point at Minitial = 1 M\u2299 , Mfinal = 0.55 M\u2299\nwhich is in good agreement with the mass of the core at\nthe first thermal pulse. The general shape of the relation and possible slope changes are discussed in detail.\nInterestingly, at the low mass end the data indicate that\nthe relation flattens off as the initial-mass scale continues down to 0.8 M\u2299 , similar to the core-radius relation\nshown in Figure 10. The NGC 6819 data point at Minitial\n= 1.61 M\u2299 , Mfinal = 0.54 M\u2299 is already within a few\nhundredths of a solar mass of the core mass (\u223c0.5 M\u2299\ndepending on Z, see core mass relation in Figure 10;\nalso Pietrinferni et al. 2004). The final mass of the\ncarbon-oxygen core white dwarf in NGC 6791 is slightly\nlower than this, and equal to the expected mass of white\ndwarfs in globular clusters (Mfinal = 0.53 M\u2299 ; Renzini &\nFusi Pecci 1988; Renzini et al. 1996; Moehler et al. 2004)\nwith present day turnoffs of Minitial = 0.8 M\u2299 . This\nflattening of the relation suggests an exponential-like behavior at low masses. Unfortunately, such a parameterization would not fit the high mass end of the relation\nvery well since those data also appear to show a flattening off. As noted by Weidemann (2000), the higher mass\nstars may in fact form white dwarfs that are structurally\ndifferent in that they have neon/oxygen cores instead of\ncarbon-oxygen cores. Reproducing the relation for stars\nwith masses greater than \u223c4.5 M\u2299 can be accomplished\nwith a log function, however this would grossly mismatch\nthe masses of the white dwarfs at the low mass end.\nLacking a satisfactory functional form of the type discussed above over the entire mass range in Figure 10, we\nresort to a simple linear fit as performed in the synthesis\ngiven by Ferrario et al. (2005). These authors took advantage of several recent studies (see earlier references)\nthat have now more than doubled the amount of data\nas compared to the Weidemann (2000) study (all for\nMinitial > 2.75 M\u2299 ). However, unlike that study, we\nwill use no anchor point to fix the relation at the low\nmass end which is otherwise needed to avoid a meaningless slope given the large scatter at intermediate masses\n(Ferrario et al. introduced a point at Minitial = 1.1 M\u2299 ,\nMfinal = 0.55 M\u2299 ). We also follow the approach introduced by Williams (2006) and bin the relation so that\neach star cluster is represented as a single point (including Sirius B). This has a few advantages. First, our fit\nwill not be over-influenced by the region of the relation\n\n\f16\n\nKalirai et al.\n\nwith the most data points. Second, the standard deviation in the distribution of masses of white dwarfs within a\ngiven cluster is a random error on the relation when comparing different clusters (Williams 2006). When plotting\nindividual data points, an error in the age of a cluster will\nlead to a systematic offset of all points on the relation\nfor that cluster. Third, our results will be less sensitive\nto any possible peculiar white dwarfs whose initial and\nfinal masses are measured accurately. The obvious disadvantage of the binned approach is that a given cluster\nis expected to have white dwarfs with a range of initial\nand final masses and therefore we are throwing away this\ninformation.\nThe initial-final mass relation based on this binned\nmethod is shown in Figure 12. We note that the 2\u03c3\noutlier at Minitial = 5.06 M\u2299 is Sirius B (Liebert et al.\n2005). The uncertainties in this plot are the standard\ndeviations in the mean initial and final mass. The solid\nline represents our weighted linear least-squares best fit,\nMfinal = (0.109 \u00b1 0.007) Minitial + 0.394 \u00b1 0.025 M\u2299 .\nAlthough an \"S\" shaped relation with curvature would\nprovide a better fit at both the lower and upper ends, we\nnote that the reduced chi squared per degree of freedom\nis \u03c72 = 1.2 in the linear fit and therefore the data are wellfit by this simple relation. If we also include a data point\nat Minitial = 0.80 \u00b1 0.02 M\u2299 and Mfinal = 0.53 \u00b1 0.02 M\u2299\nto represent the best current globular cluster constraints\n(Renzini et al. 1996; Moehler et al. 2004), the relation\nflattens slightly to Mfinal = (0.106 \u00b1 0.007) Minitial +\n0.409 \u00b1 0.022 M\u2299 . In this case, the \u03c72 of the fit is 1.3.\n9. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nA mapping of the initial mass of a hydrogen burning\nstar to its final remnant mass represents an extremely\nimportant relation in astrophysics. Over 99% of all stars\nwill end their lives as white dwarfs and expel most of\ntheir mass into the interstellar medium. The initial-final\nmass relation allows us to directly integrate this mass loss\nin a stellar population assuming an initial mass function.\nAmong the many uses of parameterizing this relation is a\nrobust estimate for the ages of the Galactic disk and halo.\nFor example, the shape of the white dwarf mass function in the Galactic disk is sharply peaked at \u223c0.6 M\u2299\n(Liebert et al. 2005; Kepler et al. 2006). The initialfinal mass relation allows us to reconstruct the distribution of masses of the progenitor hydrogen burning stars\nthat formed this peak. This therefore provides an estimate of the age of the Galactic disk, which has now been\nmeasured to be \u223c7 \u2013 9 Gyrs (Winget et al. 1987; Wood\n1992; Oswalt et al. 1996; Leggett, Ruiz, & Bergeron 1998;\nHansen et al. 2002). For a Salpeter initial mass function,\nand an age of 8 Gyrs for the Galactic disk, the shape of\nthe predicted white dwarf mass distribution based on our\ninitial-final mass relation is in excellent agreement with\nthe observed mass distribution (i.e., the peak location\nand spread, Kalirai et al. 2008, in preparation). Similarly, the ages of globular clusters in the Galactic halo\nhave been measured to be \u223c12 Gyr by comparing the observed distribution of white dwarfs on the cluster CMDs\nto synthetic cooling sequences produced using an initial\nmass function and an initial-final mass relation (Hansen\n\net al. 2004, 2007). The relation used most recently in\nthe study of NGC 6397 by Hansen et al. (2007) is shown\nas a dashed line in Figure 10 and is found to be in good\nagreement with our new low mass constraints (the disagreement at higher masses is not important since all of\nthe observed white dwarfs in NGC 6397 evolved from\nstars with M < 2 M\u2299 ).\nThe study of the white dwarf population in NGC 7789,\nNGC 6819, and NGC 6791 represents the first time that\nwe have been able to reconstruct this mapping for low\nmass stars such as the Sun, and therefore eliminate the\nneed for an indirect anchor point at low masses. Over\nhalf of the total number of stars that are produced in\na Salpeter-type initial mass function now fall within a\nregion of the initial-final mass relation that has some\nconstraints. At high masses, the relation indicates that\nstars will lose 80 \u2013 85% of their mass through stellar\nevolution. However, for stars approximately as massive\nas the Sun, this number drops to \u223c55% of the initial\nstellar mass.\nDespite these new data, the importance of the initialfinal mass relation demands further observations. To\nbetter understand the intrinsic scatter, future observations should focus on older clusters with clearly defined\nwhite dwarf cooling sequences (such as NGC 7789). By\npushing the magnitude limit fainter, more massive white\ndwarfs will be revealed that are likely descendents of\nmore massive progenitors. In this way, multiple initialfinal mass relations can be constructed over appreciable ranges from the studies of single star clusters whose\nproperties (age, metallicity, binary fraction, etc...) have\nbeen measured carefully. Such studies are ideally suited\nfor multi-object spectrographs since the white dwarf luminosity function increases as a function of magnitude\nand therefore a large number of objects can be targeted\nin a single exposure. To truly push the envelope to even\nlower masses, globular clusters should be targeted as well.\nThe nearest systems, such as M4 and NGC 6397, can\nbe studied with 8\u201310 meter telescopes (e.g., see Moehler\net al. 2004). In addition to providing constraints down\nto \u223c0.8 M\u2299 , the environments of these systems are up\nto 100\u00d7 more metal-poor than most open clusters and\ntherefore metallicity trends can be reliably studied. At\nthe opposite extreme, rich, young clusters can provide\nunique constraints and push the current high mass limit\nfurther. This will not only constrain the upper mass limit\nto white dwarf production, but also simultaneously discover the lower mass limit to type II supernova. An extrapolation of the present relation to the Chandrasekhar\nmass suggests an initial mass of \u223c9.5 M\u2299 , however this\nis very uncertain given the lack of data in this regime.\nFinally, there is a paucity of data between Minitial = 2 \u2013\n2.75 M\u2299 which can bridge our new measurements with\nthe previous data. The absence of data points in this region of the relation results from a lack of nearby, rich star\nclusters with an age of \u223c1 Gyr. Fortunately, one such\nsystem exists, NGC 2420, and has been shown to possess\na white dwarf population (von Hippel & Gilmore 2000)\nand therefore should be targeted in the near future.\nWe gratefully acknowledge P. Bergeron for providing\nus with his models and spectral fitting routines to measure the masses of white dwarfs. We also thank him and\n\n\fThe Initial-Final Mass Relation\nJames Liebert for taking the time to discuss and help\ninterpret the spectra of certain stars. We wish to thank\nRobert Eakin for assistance with processing of imaging\ndata frames and Don Vandenberg and Leo Girardi for\ntheir help with interpreting their models. Finally, we\nwish to extend our gratitude to an anonymous referee\nfor taking the time to prepare a detailed report that has\nresulted in a much improved paper.
