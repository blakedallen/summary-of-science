From a mechanical point of view, this T1 process is an elementary relaxation process through\nwhich the entire structure of an out-of-equilibrium foam evolves. The dynamics of this elementary relaxation process has been\npoorly investigated and is generally neglected during simulations of foams. We study both experimentally and theoretically the\nT1 dynamics in a dry two-dimensional foam.

At low liquid fractions (a dry foam) bubbles have polyhedral shapes for which local mechanical\nand thermodynamical equilibria lead to Plateau's laws\nfor the main geometric characteristics: e.g., three films\nmeet at each junction of a two-dimensional foam with\nequal angles of 120\u25e6 . Consequently, the rheology and geometry are linked, since as the foam structure is altered,\nrearrangements occur until a configuration is obtained\nwhere Plateau's laws are satisfied.\n\nminimization of the surface area. Various experimental\nand theoretical studies on the frequency of rearrangement\nevents in foams have been conducted [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], but\nlittle is known about the typical relaxation time associated with such events [9]. Indeed, the dynamics of the\nrelaxation processes is usually neglected in simulations\nof foams [10, 11] even though the rheological behavior of\na foam obviously depends on this relaxation time. More\ngenerally, to study the evolution of the foam structure, it\nis necessary to understand the dynamics of the elementary relaxation process.\nIn this paper, we investigate theoretically and experimentally the effect of the viscoelastic parameters on the\ndynamics of the T1 process. Experiments in a twodimensional foam show that the relaxation time depends\non the interfacial viscoelasticity of the films, but not on\nthe shear viscosity of the bulk liquid. These results are\ncorroborated by a model, which allows for an estimation\nof the Gibbs elasticity and the surface viscosity of the\nsurfactants used to make the foam.\n\nAny rearrangement in a two-dimensional foam may be\nregarded as a combination of two elementary topological\nprocesses referred to as T1 and T2 [1]. The T1 process\ncorresponds to the \"flip\" of one soap film, as depicted\nin Fig. 1, while the T2 process corresponds to the disappearance of cells with three sides. From a mechanical\npoint of view, the T1 process corresponds to a transition from one metastable configuration to another, after passing through an unstable configuration where four\nfilms meet at one junction (actually, for a small but finite liquid fraction, the instability arises slightly before\nthe four-fold vertex is formed [3]). The spontaneous evolution from one four-fold junction to two three-fold junctions, which involves creation of a new film, is driven by\n\nThe experimental setup is depicted in Fig. 2: a dry\ntwo-dimensional foam is created in a horizontal Plexiglas\ncell (1 cm high) by blowing air through a bottle containing a surfactant solution. The polyhedral bubbles\ncreated have a typical edge length of 1-2 cm. The liquid\nfraction in the foam, defined as the total volume of liquids in the Plexiglas cell divided by the cell volume, is\nabout 1%. Two different foaming agents have been used\nin order to study the influence of the rheological properties of the interface on the T1 dynamics: (i) Sodium\nDodecyl Sulfate (SDS), at a concentration of 4.80 g/L,\n1\n\n\fy\n\n120\u00b0\n2 Ly 2 \u03b1\n0\n\n0\n\nx\n\n2 Lx\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nL(t)\n2 \u03b1(t)\n\n120\u00b0\n\n(d)\n\n2 xB(t)\nFIG. 2: (color online) Experimental setup: a two-dimensional\nfoam is created in a 1 cm high horizontal Plexiglas cell by\nblowing air through a surfactant solution. The bubbles are\npolyhedral with an edge length of 1-2 cm and the liquid fraction in the foam is about 1%. Using a syringe, air is blown\naway from one bubble, which induces rearrangements, that\nare viewed from above using a high-speed camera.\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) Schematic of the T1 transition. The initial configuration (a) evolves continuously through metastable\nstates, for which Plateau's laws are satisfied, to an unstable\nfour-fold configuration (b). This unstable state spontaneously\nevolves into two three-fold junctions with creation of a new\nfilm (c) until a new metastable configuration (d) is reached,\nand Plateau's laws are satisfied again. Topologically, the transition between the initial configuration (a) and the final configuration (b) corresponds to a \"flip\" of one soap film.\n\nthe viscoelastic properties of the interfaces [12, 13].\nWe note that as the foam is constrained between two\nplanes, most of the liquid of each soap film is located\nin the menisci close to the solid surfaces. In this region\nthere is dissipation that depends on the shear viscosity of\nthe solution. Hence, from our experimental observations\nwe conclude that frictional effects at the boundaries have\na negligible influence on the T1 dynamics. This result is\nnot in contradiction with the observations made on the\nrheology of 2D foam [14, 15, 16], where a macroscopic\nstress (pressure drop) causes motion of the foam relative\nto the boundaries and the shear viscosity of the bulk\nsolution is the main parameter controlling the dynamics.\nNext, we compare the SDS results with those from the\nBSA/PGA solution \u03bc = 7 mPa.s, both without glycerol. We observe a change in the typical relaxation time\nby about a factor of 7 (T \u2243 3.7 sec for the BSA/PGA\nsolution). Although, coincidentally, the viscosity of the\nBSA/PGA solution is increased by a factor 7 relative to\nthe SDS solution, we can rule out this influence since we\njust demonstrated that the viscosity of the solution is\nnot rate limiting. We also verified that the addition of\nglycerol to the BSA/PGA solution did not produce any\nsignificant change in the typical relaxation times (results\nnot shown). These results allow us to conclude that the\nviscoelastic properties of the interfaces dictate the relaxation time of the T1 process.\nWe now provide a brief description of a theoretical\nframework for the T1 dynamics; for details of the derivation and complete considerations of various special cases\nsee [17]. We compare the theoretical predictions with the\nexperiments, which allows us to extract surface rheological parameters. The net result is a model for the T1\nprocess and estimates for the relaxation time.\nWe assume that the geometry is symmetrical with thin\n\nforms \"mobile\" surfaces, and (ii) protein Bovine Serum\nAlbumin, together with a cosurfactant Propylene Glycol\nAlginate (PGA), both at concentrations of 4.00 g/L, form\n\"rigid\" interfaces. The impact of the shear viscosity of\nthe bulk liquid has been investigated by adding glycerol,\n0%, 60% and 72% (w/w), to the bulk solutions.\nIn order to cause rearrangements in the foam, we use a\nsyringe to blow the air away from one bubble. Then the\nrearrangements are viewed from above with a high-speed\ncamera. The length of the soap film is measured by following its two ends using particle-tracking software. Experiments where the other vertices have noticeable movements during the relaxation process, or where simultaneous T1 events occur, have been disregarded.\nThe relaxation process is characterized by the creation\nof a new soap film following the appearance of a four-fold\njunction. For different surfactant systems, we report the\nlength of the new film, normalized by its final length, as\na function of time in Fig. 3. Several trials for each solution are shown and illustrate that the time evolution\nof the reduced length appears independent of the final\nfilm length. We define a typical time T associated with\nthe relaxation process as the time for the film to reach\n90% of its final length. A comparison of the results for a\nfoam made with the SDS without glycerol (shear viscosity of the liquid \u03bc = 1.0 mPa.s) and with 60% glycerol\n(\u03bc = 10.7 mPa.s) shows that there is no significant effect\nof the viscosity of the bulk liquid (T \u2243 0.5 sec for both solutions). This response is not unreasonable since, for the\nmechanics of a free soap film, viscous effects of the bulk\nare generally negligible in comparison with the effects of\n2\n\n\fing inertia terms and dissipative terms associated with\nthe viscosity of the bulk liquid [17], Newton's second law\napplied to the film reduces to a balance between surface\ntension contributions and surface dissipative terms (\u03bcs\nand \u03ba denote the shear and dilatational viscosities and\n\u03b3eq denotes the equilibrium value of the surface tension\nof the soap solution):\n2\u03b3eq cos \u03b1(t) \u2212 \u03b3(t) \u2212 (\u03bcs + \u03ba)\n\n(2)\n\nDuring the expansion of the new film, adjacent films act\nas surfactant reservoirs, so that \u03b3(t) and \u0393(t) are assumed to be close to their equilibrium values, and so\nare related by the Langmuir equation of state: \u03b3(t) =\n\u03b3eq \u2212 \u01eb ln (\u0393(t)/\u0393eq ), where \u01eb is the Gibbs elasticity and\n\u0393eq is the equilibrium surface density. This equilibrium\nvalue \u0393eq is assumed to be present in the adjacent films.\nNext, we turn to a mass balance on the surfactant.\nThis requires accounting for stretching of the interface\nas well as addition of surfactant to the new surface created as the adjacent films, of length L(t), are shortened.\nWe assume that as surfactant is added to the end of the\nstretching film the surface density is rapidly adjusted to\na spatially uniform state by strong Marangoni forces. In\naddition, we neglect diffusion/adsorption processes from\nthe bulk liquid, restricting our study at short times (these\nslower processes only affect shape adjustments as the final equilibrium is approached). So, the change in the total number of surfactant molecules during a time interval\ndt is d (\u0393xb ) = \u2212\u0393eq dL, where dL = \u2212dxB . cos \u03b1(t); here\nwe have only accounted for one interface of each adjacent\nfilm as feeding the stretched film since surfactant from\nthe other interface must desorb from the surface, transit through the bulk, then adsorb to the stretched interface, which is a much longer process. Integration of this\nequation allows us to express \u0393(t)qas a function of xB (t):\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) Evolution of the film length, normalized by its final length, with time.

We focus on the dynamics of the stretching central\nfilm of length 2xB (t), which is driven by the monotonic\ndecrease of the angle \u03b1(t):\nLx \u2212 xB (t)\ncos \u03b1(t) = q\n.\n2\n2\nLy + (Lx \u2212 xB (t))\n\n\u2202U\n= 0.\n\u2202x\n\n, where Lc = L2y + (Lx \u2212 x0 )2 + x0\n\u0393(t) = \u0393eq Lxc \u2212L(t)\nB (t)\n(x0 = xB (0)). In addition, with the above approximations, the density along the film must also satisfy the local\n\u2202U\nconservation law d\u0393\nof these two\ndt +\u0393 \u2202x = 0.

Also, we\n\n\u0005\n\nsmaller than the velocity of the junction itself (= xB ).\nThis velocity difference is a consequence of the slip of\nthe surface (and surfactant) coming from the adjacent\nfilm. Finally, Eq. 2 is rewritten as an evolution equation\nfor xB (t):\n\nintroduce the length L(t) = L2y + (Lx \u2212 xB (t))2 of the\nadjacent films which shorten with time. Since the flat\nfilm can support no pressure gradient the axial velocity\nU (x, t) in the main body of the film is a linear function\nof position, U \u221d x [18]. This uniform extensional motion\nmeans that away from other films we have \u03b3(t) and \u0393(t),\nwhich do not change with position x.\nThe dynamics follow from a force balance on the\nstretching film and a surfactant mass balance.

At short times\n(typically, for times below 0.1 sec for SDS and 0.8 sec\nfor BSA), their evolution is nearly linear, in excellent\nagreement with the theory. A linear fit of the experimental data plotted in this way allows determination of\n\u03bcs + \u03ba and \u01eb, using well-established equilibrium surface\ntension values of SDS and BSA (38 mN/m [22] and 55\nmN/m [23], respectively). The mean values we obtained\nare \u01eb = 32 \u00b1 8 mN/m and \u03bcs + \u03ba = 1.3 \u00b1 0.7 mPa.m.s for\nSDS, and \u01eb = 65\u00b112 mN/m and \u03bcs +\u03ba = 31\u00b112 mPa.m.s\nfor BSA/PGA, which are in good agreement with values\nreported in the literature (e.g. [24, 25]). Note, however,\nthat our value of the surface viscosity of SDS correspond\nto the highest value reported in literature [24], which, in\nboth studies, may be a consequence of the rapid surface\nstretching giving rise to some nonlinear or inertial effects.\nIn addition, there is a large difference between values of\nthe shear and dilatational surface viscosities, and it is often unclear in published works which surface viscosity is\nactually measured.\nThis study of the T1 dynamics in a two-dimensional\nfoam illustrates that the relaxation time T associated\n+\u03ba\nwith the process is a function of two parameters, \u03bc\u03b3seq\n\nFIG. 4:\n(color online) Typical plot of the experimental data (Fig.\n3) reported as Y (t)\n=\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0005\n\u0001\n\u0393eq\nxB\n1\n1 \u2212 \u0393(t) cos \u03b1(t) / cos \u03b1(t) \u2212 2\nversus X(t)\n=\nxB\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\nLc \u2212L(t)\n1\nln xB (t) / cos \u03b1(t) \u2212 2 ; (a) SDS and (b) BSA/PGA.\nNote the nearly linear evolution in time, which is in good\nagreement with the theory.
