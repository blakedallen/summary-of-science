The model contains all known FF\n\n3\n\n\fproperties like experimental fact of a creation of vector-meson resonances in electronpositron annihilation processes into hadrons, the assumed nucleon FF analytic properties, unitary condition, normalization\nF1s (0) = F1v (0) = 1/2; F2s (0) = 1/2(\u03bcp + \u03bcn ); F2v (0) = 1/2(\u03bcp \u2212 \u03bcn ),\n\n(8)\n\nand the asymptotic behaviour as predicted by quark model of hadrons\nF1s,v (t)||t|\u2192\u221e \u223c t\u22122 ;\n\nF2s,v (t)||t|\u2192\u221e \u223c t\u22123 .\n\n(9)\n\nFigure 2: Description of GEp (t) and GM p (t) data by unitary and analytic model\n\nFigure 3: Description of GEn (t) and GM n (t) data by unitary and analytic model\nIn such a way it provides a very effective framework for a consistent superposition of\ncomplex conjugate vector-meson pole pair and continuum contributions with all other\nnucleon FF properties and describes well (see Figs. 2,3) first time all existing spacelike (obtained by Rosenbluth technique) and time-like nucleon FF data simultaneously,\ndespite of the fact that the obtained by Rosenbluth technique data on electric proton\n4\n\n\fFF GEp (t) in t < 0 region are significantly less precise than the data on GM p (t), since\nGM p (t) is dominant in differential cross-section (4), from the experimental values of\nwhich both, GEp (t) and GM p (t), are extracted.\n\n3\n\nConsequences following from JLAB proton polarization data\n\nFrom Fig.1 it is straightforward to see, that GEp fall is steeper than the fall of dipole\nformula, but less intense than tripole one.\nKnowing the ratio GEp /GM p one can extract also data on the ratio F2p /F1p by the\nexpression\n!\n\n!\n\nGEp (Q2 )\nQ2\nGEp (Q2 )\nF2p (Q2 )\n.\n/\n=\n1\n\u2212\n+\nF1p (Q2 )\nGM p (Q2 )\nGM p (Q2 ) 4m2p\n\n(10)\n\nThen Q2 F2p /F1p indicates continuing increase (see Fig.4) with Q2 . However, if we\n\nFigure 4: Data on F2p /F1p multiplied by Q2 and Q respectively\nmultiply the data on ratio F2p /F1p only by Q, then they acquire constant behaviour\nwith Q2 . So, the new JLab proton polarization data indicate that the proton Pauli FF\nhas (at least in the interval 1.8GeV 2 \u2264 Q2 \u2264 5.6GeV 2 ) the behaviour\nF2p (Q2 ) \u223c Q\u22125\n\n(11)\n\nwhich is in contradiction with the PQCD predictions [6],[7]\nF2p (Q2 )||Q2|\u2192\u221e \u223c Q\u22126 .\n5\n\n(12)\n\n\fIf the latter is true, then from the definition of the proton electric FF (3) it follows\nthat |GEp (Q2 )| must to have a zero, i.e. diffraction minimum, at some higher Q2 .\n\n4\n\nSolution of the puzzle\n\nOn the base of our analysis above we are now in the position:\ni) The data on GEp (t) and GM p (t) in t < 0 region, obtained by Rosenbluth technique\nfrom d\u03c3/d\u03a9, are compatible with all other existing nucleon FF data and all known\nFF properties, including also the QCD asymptotics.\nii) The very precise JLab proton polarization data on (1 + \u03bcp )GEp (Q2 )/GM p (Q2 )\ncontradict (at least in the region 1.8 \u2264 Q2 \u2264 5.6GeV 2 ) predictions of PQCD.\nNow, what data on GEp (t) in t < 0 region are true and what data are wrong?\nIn a solution of the latter problem we have proceeded as follows. Since the magnetic\nproton FF GM p (Q2 ) is (owing to the factor\n\nt\n)\n4m2p\n\ndominant at the differential cross-\n\nsection (4) of e\u2212 p \u2192 e\u2212 p (at Q2 =\u2212t \u2248 3GeV 2 the electric proton FF contributes only\n5% to the cross-section value and for higher momenta it is even less), the obtained\ndata on electric proton FF could be unreliable, even wrong. On the other hand,\na simultaneous measurement of the transverse and longitudinal components of the\nrecoil proton's polarization in the electron scattering plane of the polarization transfer\nprocess ~e\u2212 p \u2192 e\u2212 p~ is very effective and reliable method of a determination of the ratio\nGEp /GM p . As a result we believe in the obtained data presented in Fig.1 and their\nviolation of QCD asymptotics given by (11) we consider to be a local effect.\nThis our conjecture we verify in the framework of the global unitary and analytic\nmodel of nucleon EM structure which contains the QCD asymptotics automatically.\nFirst, we exclude from the set of all existing proton and neutron EM FF data the spacelike data on GEp (t) obtained from d\u03c3/d\u03a9 by Rosenbluth technique. We substitute them\nfor JLab proton polarization data on (1 + \u03bcp )GEp (t)/GM p (t). Then by means of the\n\n6\n\n\f10 -resonance unitary and analytic model of nucleon EM structure [5] we carry out a\nfitting procedure of all these data simultaneously which provides in such a way test of:\ni) consistency of the JLab proton polarization data with all other proton and neutron EM FF data\nii) consistency of these data with the powerful tool of physics - the analyticity\niii) their consistency with the asymptotic behaviour as predicted (up to logarithmic\ncorrections) by QCD.\n\nFigure 5: Description of the JLab proton polarization data by unitary and analytic\nmodel\n\nFigure 6: Results of the JLab proton t < 0 data analysis (dashed lines) for GEp (t) and\nGM p (t)\n\n7\n\n\fFigure 7: Results of the JLab proton t < 0 data analysis (dashed lines) for GEn (t) and\nGM n (t)\nWe have obtained very surprising results. A perfect description of the JLab proton\npolarization data (see Fig.5) was achieved. The fitted parameters of the unitary and\nanalytic model of nucleon EM structure are almost unchanged in comparison with\nthose given in [5]. A description of the GEp (t) time-like data, of all GM p (t) data and\nspace-like and time-like neutron EM FF data is (see dashed lines in Figs. 6,7) changed\nvery little.\nSo, we come to the conclusion, that the JLab proton polarization data are consistent\nwith all other existing nucleon EM FF data besides space-like GEp (t) data obtained\nfrom d\u03c3(e\u2212 p \u2192 e\u2212 p)/d\u03a9 by Rosenbluth technique. They are consistent with analyticity\nand they don't contradict the QCD asymptotics, however they strongly require an\nexistence of the zero in |GEp (t)| (i.e. a diffraction minimum well known in nuclear EM\nFF's) around t = \u221215GeV 2 .\n\n5\n\nConclusions and discussion\n\nRecent JLab proton polarization data on (1 + \u03bcp )GEp (Q2 )/GM p (Q2 ), obtained by a\nsimultaneous measurement of the transverse and longitudinal components of the recoil\nproton's polarization in the electron scattering plane of the polarization transfer process\n~ep \u2192 e~p at the region 0.3GeV 2 \u2264 Q2 \u2264 5.6GeV 2 , revealed a remarkable fall of GEp (Q2 )\nwith increased Q2 , which contradicts previous GEp (t) data determined from d\u03c3(e\u2212 p \u2192\n8\n\n\fe\u2212 p)/d\u03a9 by Rosenbluth technique and so, also the QCD asymptotics.\nDiscarding all GEp (t) data obtained by Rosenbluth technique in space-like region\nwe have analyzed new JLab proton polarized space-like data together with all other\nnucleon EM FF data in the framework of the unitary and analytic model of the nucleon\nEM structure from Ref. [5].\nOn the basis of the obtained results we came to the conclusions, that the JLab\nproton polarization data are consistent with all nucleon EM FF data, besides spacelike GEp (t) data obtained by Rosenbluth technique, and also with QCD asymptotics,\nhowever, they require an existence of a zero (i.e. diffraction minimum) of |GEp (t)|\naround t = \u221215GeV 2 . So there is a challenge to experimental groups to confirm our\nconclusion by measuring (1 + \u03bcp )GEp (Q2 )/GM p (Q2 ) at higher momenta.\nThis work was in part supported by Slovak Grant Agency for Sciences, Grant\n2/1111/23.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.R.
