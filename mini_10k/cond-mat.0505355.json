Together with the achievement of degenerate\nstates of such systems [3, 4, 5], this experimental feat has\nopened investigative opportunities for the study of new\nultracold regimes. From the theoretical point of view,\non the other hand, studies of Bose-Fermi mixtures to\ndate have been mostly limited to non resonant physics,\nfocusing mainly on mean field effects in trapped systems [6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13], phases in optical lattices\n[14, 15, 16, 17], or equilibrium studies of homogeneous\ngases, focusing mainly on phonon induced superfluidity\nor beyond-mean-field effects [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23].\nThis paper introduces a time dependent theory of the\nBose-Fermi mixture that accounts for the resonant interaction. In systems where the resonant interaction is\nbetween two bosons [24, 25, 26] or between two fermions\n[27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33], the theory of \"resonant superfluidity\" has already been articulated. This theory is, so far, a\nbig success. In the Bose case, it quantitatively describes\nthe coherent conversion of bosonic atoms into bosonic\nmolecules and back. Indeed, Ramsey interferometry on\nthis system, coupled with this theoretical analysis, has\nproduced the most accurate interaction potentials yet between ultracold rubidium atoms [9]. In the Fermi case,\nthe theory has produced important qualitative insights\ninto the crossover regime between weakly-interacting\nCooper pairs on the one hand, and Bose-condensed\nmolecules on the other [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34].\nIt seems worthwhile, therefore, to adapt the same level\nof theory to the resonant Bose-Fermi mixture. In this\npaper we formulate the problem by writing down the relevant equations of motion at the level of Hartree-FockBogoliubov (HFB) approximation. The equation of motion are suitably number- and energy-conserving, as are\n\ntheir counterparts in boson of fermion systems. However, in sharp contrast to these systems, the HFB theory\napplied to the Bose-Fermi resonance does not provide\nquantitatively reasonable results. Specifically we show,\nby direct numerical solution that the theory cannot reproduce the binding energy of a Bose-Fermi molecule,\neven in the limit of low density.\nThe source of this difficulty lies in the approximate\ntreatment of three-body correlations in the theory. The\nmolecules, after all, are composed of two atoms, so\nthe atom-atom-molecule correlation function is of central importance in determining properties of the resulting molecules. In the HFB theory, this three-body correlation function is approximated in terms of two-body\ncorrelation functions, which is adequate for Bose-Bose\nand Fermi-Fermi resonances, but not for the Bose-Fermi\nmixture. Ultimately, the critical missing piece will turn\nout to involve the non condensed bosonic atoms.\nThis paper is organized as follows: We begin our discussion in section II by introducing the Hamiltonian of\nthe system, and justifying such choice. We then proceed\nto outline the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon\n(BBGKY) formalism used to derived the HFB equations\nof motion, and show the form they take in free space. In\nsection III we present our results, by first analyzing the\nequations by physical and analytical insight, and then\npresenting numerical results in support of our conclusions.\nSection ?? approaches the problem from an alternative, perturbative point of view, relevant to low fermionic\ndensities. From this analysis it is clear that molecular\nbinding energies will not be recovered without adequately\naccounting for the non condensed bosons, thus pointing\nto their need for a higher-order theory.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nwhere\n\nTHEORETICAL FORMALISM\nA.\n\nH0 =\n\nThe Hamiltonian\n\n\u2020\n\u01ebF\np \u00e2p \u00e2p +\n\np\n\nWe are interested primarily in the effects of resonant\nbehavior on the otherwise reasonably understood properties of the system. To this end we use a model which,\nin the last few years, has become one of the standards in\nthe literature, and which was used to study the effect\nof resonant scattering in systems composed of bosons\n[24, 25, 26], and fermions [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Because there is already a significant literature explaining\nthe details involved in the choice of the appropriate model\nHamiltonian, we only outline the extent of the approximation involved in such a choice.\nAn accurate approach to the problem would have to\nincorporate several scattering channels, since the resonance in question is a consequence of the intertwined\nbehavior of the complex internal structures of the atoms.\nIn a field theoretical sense, that would imply having to\nconsider vector fields for the bosons and fermions with\nas many components as there are spin states involved\nin the interaction, and a non local interaction tensor of\nadequate size, to account for all coupling between such\ncomponents. Fortunately, if we assume that the resonances in the system are sufficiently far from each other,\nsuch that it is possible to define a \"background,\" or away\nfrom resonance behavior, we can focus on only one resonance at a time, which in turn makes it possible for an\neffective two channel model to describe the resonance.\nFurthermore, since the closed channel threshold is energetically unaccessible at the temperatures of interest,\nwe can \"integrate out\" the closed channel components of\nthe fermion and boson field, in favor of a fermion fields\nwhich we identify as representative of the motion of one\nboson and one fermion, and which we dub the \"molecular field.\" In the appropriate limit the molecular field\nidentifies bound states between fermions and bosons. We\nemphasize that the molecular field is a theoretical artifice that alleviates the need to treat relative motion of\ntwo atoms on the natural scale of the interaction (tens\nof Bohr radii). However, this model is appropriate for\nthe study of the systems at hand, typically composed of\n1012 40 K atoms per cubic centimeter, whereby the characteristic length scales associated with the many body\nsystem are of the order of the inverse Fermi wavenumber,\n(thousands of Bohr radii), and the average interparticle\nspacing (tens of thousands Bohr radii), which is given by\n3 1/3\n( 4\u03c0\u03c1\n) , where \u03c1 is the atomic density. Lastly, since the\ncoupling terms in the Hamiltonian represent an effective\ninteraction, we can choose its functional form, and we do\nso by choosing to deal with contact interactions, which\nsimplify the calculations immensely.\nThe resulting Hamiltonian has the following form:\n\nH = H 0 + HI ,\n\nX\n\n(1)\n\nX\n\n\u2020\n\u01ebB\np b\u0302p b\u0302p +\n\np\n\nX\n\n\u01ebM\np +\u03bd\n\np\n\n\u03b3 X \u2020\n+\nb\u0302p\u2212q b\u0302\u2020p\u2032 +q b\u0302p b\u0302p\u2032\n2V\n\u2032\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0109\u2020p \u0109p\n\np,p ,q\n\nHI\n\nVbg X \u2020\n\u00e2p\u2212q b\u0302\u2020p\u2032 +q \u00e2p b\u0302p\u2032\n=\nV\np,p\u2032 ,q\ng X \u2020\n+ \u221a\n(\u0109q \u00e2\u2212p+q/2 b\u0302p+q/2 + h.c.).\nV q,p\n\n(2)\n\nHere \u00e2p , b\u0302p , are the annihilator operators for, respectively, fermions and bosons, \u0109p is the annihilator operator\nfor the molecular field [27, 31, 32]; \u03b3 = 4\u03c0ab /mb is the\ninteraction term for bosons, where ab is the boson-boson\nscattering length; and Vbg , \u03bd, and g are parameters related to the Bose Fermi interaction, yet to be determined.\nAlso we define single particle energies \u01eb\u03b1 = p2 /2m\u03b1 ,\nwhere m\u03b1 indicates the mass of bosons, fermions, or\npairs, and V as the volume of a quantization box with\nperiodic boundary conditions.\nB.\n\nTwo Body Scattering Parameters\n\nThe first step is to find the values for Vbg , \u03bd, g, in terms\nof measurable parameters. We will, for this purpose, calculate the 2-body T-matrix resulting from the Hamiltonian in eq. 2. Integrating the molecular field out of the\nreal time path integral, [41] leads to the following BoseFermi interaction Hamiltonian\n\u0012\n\u0013X\n1\ng2\nHI2body =\nVbg +\n\u00e2\u2020p b\u0302\u2020\u2212p \u00e2p b\u0302\u2212p . (3)\nV\nE\u2212\u03bd\np\nThis expression is represented in center of mass coordinates, and E is the collision energy of the system. From\nthe above equation we read trivially the zero energy Tmatrix in the saddle point approximation\nT = (Vbg \u2212\n\ng2\n),\n\u03bd\n\n(4)\n\nwhich corresponds to the Born approximation, and we\nproceed to match it to the conventional parameterization\n[25, 27]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206B\n2\u03c0\n,\n(5)\nabg 1 \u2212\nT (B) =\nmbf\n(B \u2212 B0 )\nwhere abg is the value of the scattering length far from\nresonance, \u2206B is the width, in magnetic field, of the resonance, mbf is the reduced mass, and B0 is the field at\nwhich the resonance is centered.\nThe identification of parameters between eqns, (4) and\n(5) proceeds as follows: far from resonance, |B \u2212 B0 | >>\n\n\f3\n\u2206B , the interaction is defined by a background scatter2\u03c0a\ning length, via Vbg = mbfbg . To relate magnetic field\ndependent quantity B \u2212 B0 to its energy dependent analog \u03bd, requires defining a parameter \u03b4B = \u2202\u03bd/\u2202B, which\nmay be thought of as a kind of magnetic moment for the\nmolecules. It is worth noting that \u03bd does not represent\nthe position of the resonance nor the binding energy of\nthe molecules, and that, in general \u03b4B is a field-dependent\nquantity, since the molecular binding energy approaches\nthreshold quadratically. For current purposes we identify \u03b4B by its behavior far from resonance, where it is\napproximately constant. Careful calculations of scattering properties using the model in eq. (2), however, leads\nto the correct Breit-Wigner behavior of the 2-body Tmatrix, as we show in section IV\nFinally we get the following identifications:\n2\u03c0a\n\nVbg = mbfbg\np\ng = Vbg \u03b4B \u2206B\n\u03bd = \u03b4B (B \u2212 B0 ).\n\n(6)\n\nFor our calculations we use the 511G resonance in the\n40\nK-87 Rb system, the parameters we use in the calculations to follow are abg = \u2212202a0 , \u03b4B = 5.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 K/G,\nand \u2206B = 1G.\nC.\n\nThe Formalism\n\nWe now move on to the many body analysis, and derive the Heisenberg equations of motion for the many\nbody system. The way this is done, is to find equation of\nmotion for correlation functions, fs (x1 , ....xs ), which represent the probability of finding s particles at positions\nx1 , ..., xs . As it turns out, the equation of motion for\nthe correlation function f1 will depend on the function\nf2 , which in turn will depend on f3 , and so on all the\nway to fN , where N is the total number of particles in\nthe system. This is known as a Bogoliubov-Born-GreenKirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy [35]. In practice\nwe will be concerned with momentum space correlation\nfunctions, but the idea is the same.\nGiven the large number of particles in the system, it\nis impossible to calculate equation of motions for all correlation functions, and we need to invoke an approximation. In practice, correlation functions are often calculated only up to two-body correlations, s = 2. This is\njustified under the assumption that interactions are suitably \"weak.\" Higher-order correlations are included in an\napproximate way by considering, not the actual atomic\nconstituents, but rather combinations called quasiparticles. The quasiparticles are defined to be noninteracting, so that their higher-order correlation functions can\nbe written in terms of second order correlation functions\n[41].\n\nUsing this qualitative idea we proceed to develop a\nmore formal understanding. In statistical field theory,\ngiven an operator O, and Hamiltonian H, we define the\nthermal\b average of O with respect to H as < O >H =\n1/ZT r Oe\u2212\u03b2H , where\n= (kB T )\u22121 is the inverse tem\b \u03b2\u2212\u03b2H\nperature, and Z = T r e\nis the partition function.\nIn this framework, the 1-particle correlation function is\ndefined as the thermal average of the number operator,\nwith respect to the Hamiltonian of the system.\nIn the quasi-particle representation, we define the annihilation operator for quasi-particles as \u03b1, reminding ourselves that it is a complicated function of a, a\u2020 , b, b\u2020 , c, c\u2020 .\nIn momentum space, the 1-particle correlation function\nin this representation, will then be < \u03b1p1 \u03b1p2 >Hqp , where\nHqp is the (noninteracting) quasi-particle Hamiltonian.\nNow we introduce the real approximation, namely that\nthe quasi-particles can be written as linear combinations\nof all possible products of two operators (except for averages involving one fermionic and one bosonic operator,\nwhich are easily shown to vanish). The procedure is then\nto find the Heisenberg equations of motion for these pairs\nof operators, and then averaging over the quasi-particle\nHamiltonian\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\n< O >Hqp =< [O, H] >Hqp ,\n\u2202t\n\n(7)\n\nwhich being Gaussian allows us to invoke Wick's theorem\nto decompose all higher order correlations in 1-particle\ncorrelations, thus truncating the BBGKY hierarchy.\n\nD.\n\nThe Equations of Motion\n\nBefore generating Heisenberg equations, we need to\ntake a little care in the treatment of the Bose field,\nto properly treat the condensed part. To this end we\nperform the usual separation of mean-field and fluctuations of the Bose field, substituting b0 ( the zeromomentum component of the Bose gas) with a c-number\n\u03c6 =< b0 >Hqp , and identifying it with the condensate\namplitude, while < bp6=0 >Hqp = 0 are the fluctuations.\nWe insert these definitions in the Hamiltonian in eq. (2),\nthen proceed to calculate commutators.\nSince we wish to limit our analysis to a homogeneous\ngas, we note that the correlation functions f1 (x, x\u2032 ) can\nbe written in terms of a relative coordinate y = x \u2212 x\u2032 .\nThus in momentum space f1 (p) is the probability to find\na particle with momentum p in the gas, or in other words\nit is the momentum distribution of the system.\nHaving taken all appropriate commutators, and applied Wick's theorem, (for more details on the procedure\nsee [36], or Appendix A for the derivation of a sample\nequation.), we obtain the following self consistent set of\nequations of motion for the system:\n\n\f4\n\n\u2202\n\u03c6 = Vbg \u03c1F \u03c6 + \u03b3 (2\u03c6\u03c1\u0303B + \u2206B \u03c6\u2217 ) + g\u03c1\u2217MF + \u03b3|\u03c6|2 \u03c6\n\u2202t\nh\ni\n2\n\u2202\nh\u0304 \u03b7\u0303(p) = 2\u03b3 Im \u03baB (p)(\u03c6\u2217 + \u2206\u2217B )\n\u2202t\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202\n2\n2\nih\u0304 \u03baB (p) = \u01ebB\nP + 2Vbg \u03c1F + 4\u03b3(|\u03c6| + \u03c1 \u0303B ) \u03baB (p) + \u03b3(2\u03b7 \u0303B (p) + 1)(\u03c6 + \u2206B )\n\u2202t\n\u2202\nh\u0304 \u03b7F (p) = \u22122g Im(\u03c6\u03b7MF (p))\n\u2202t\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202\n2\nih\u0304 \u03baF (p) = \u01ebF\np + 2Vbg (\u03c1 \u0303B + |\u03c6| ) \u03baF (p)\n\u2202t\n\u2202\nh\u0304 \u03b7M (p) = 2g Im(\u03c6\u03b7MF (p))\n\u2202t\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202\nih\u0304 \u03baM (p) = \u01ebM\nP + \u03bd \u03baM (p)\n\u2202t\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202\nM\n2\n\u2217\nih\u0304 \u03b7MF (p) = \u01ebF\np \u2212 \u01ebp \u2212 \u03bd + Vbg (\u03c1 \u0303B + |\u03c6| ) \u03b7MF (p) \u2212 g\u03c6 (\u03b7F (p) \u2212 \u03b7M (p))\n\u2202t\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202\nM\n2\n\u2217\nih\u0304 \u03baMF (p) = \u01ebF\np + \u01ebp + \u03bd + Vbg (\u03c1 \u0303B + |\u03c6| ) \u03baMF (p) \u2212 g [\u03c6\u03baF (p) + \u03c6 \u03baM (p)] ,\n\u2202t\nih\u0304\n\nwhere \u03b7 \u0303B (p) =< b\u2020p6=0 bp6=0 >Hqp is the momentum distriR dp 2\nbution of non-condensed bosons, and \u03c1\u0303B = 2\u03c0\n2 p \u03b7 \u0303\nB (p)\nis the density of non-condensed bosons; \u03baB (p) =<\nbp6=0 bp6=0 >Hqp is the anomalous distribution of bosonic\nR dp 2\nfluctuations, and \u2206B =\n2\u03c0 2 p \u03baB (p) the anomalous\ndensity.

Inspection of these equations, however, allows us\nto simplify the set quite dramatically, without sacrific-\n\nih\u0304\n\n(8.c)\n(8.d)\n(8.e)\n(8.f)\n(8.g)\n(8.h)\n(8.i)\n\nThe next thing we notice is that the evolution of the\nnormal and anomalous bosonic averages is completely independent of the resonant interaction, and is controlled\nonly by the background interactions between bosons\nand with fermions. For typical background interaction\nstrengths, and cold enough temperatures, it is well established that quantum depletion is minor, and the system\nis well described at the Gross-Pitaevskii level of approximation.\nWe can therefore write the following reduced set of\nequations:\n\n\u2202\n\u03b7F (p) = \u22122g Im(\u03c6\u03b7MF (p))\n\u2202t\n\u2202\nh\u0304 \u03b7M (p) = 2g Im(\u03c6\u03b7MF (p))\n\u2202t\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u2202\n\u2217\nM\n2\nih\u0304 \u03b7MF (p) = \u01ebF\np \u2212 \u01ebp \u2212 \u03bd + Vbg |\u03c6| \u03b7MF (p) \u2212 g\u03c6 (\u03b7F (p) \u2212 \u03b7M (p)) .\n\u2202t\nTogether with the prospect of simulating time dependent\n\n(8.b)\n\ning almost any of the physics thereby contained. First,\nwe notice that the evolution of the anomalous fermionic\ndensities \u03baMF (p), \u03baF (p), and \u03baM (p) is entirely decoupled\nfrom the evolution of all other quantities, and can therefore be considered separately. This implies that, since\nwe are mainly interested in the evolution of the normal\ndensities, we can eliminate without approximation all the\nanomalous ones.\n\n\u2202\n\u03c6 = (Vbg \u03c1F + \u03b3|\u03c6|2 )\u03c6 + g\u03c1\u2217MF\n\u2202t\n\nh\u0304\n\n(8.a)\n\n(9.a)\n(9.b)\n(9.c)\n(9.d)\n\nexperiments, such a set of equations allow us to calculate\n\n\f5\n\nFigure 1 shows a representative example of time evolution of the condensate population (number conservation\nguarantees that all three populations oscillate with the\nsame frequency) under the conditions described above.\nIn this particular example, at time t=0 the detuning\nis suddenly shifted to \u22125.110\u22126K, corresponding to a\nmagnetic field detuning of approximatively .1G. The response of the population shows an envelope function, indicated by the gray shaped area, that arises from nonlinearities in the equations of motion. The inset shows that\nunder this envelope is a well defined sinusoidal oscillation.\nThe nearly monochromatic character of the response is\nmade clear by Fourier transforming the time dependent\npopulation. The Fourier Transform shown in the second\npanel of Fig 1 is strongly peaked at 5.4 \u00d7 10\u22126 K. Similarly, the position of the peak in the frequency spectrum,\nfor different final detunings, should map the molecular\nbinding energy as a function of magnetic field.\nFigure 2 shows the results obtained by this method.\nThis plot represents the binding energy of the molecules,\ndressed by the interactions in the system. This dressing is\nexpected to be weaker for smaller densities of atoms and\nmolecules. In this limit, we should thus recover the two\nbody molecular binding energy, which can be calculated\nquite accurately from two body close coupling calculations (solid line in fig 2). Instead we see that the pole\nbehavior approaches the bare detuning (dashed line in\nfig 2), indicating that the renormalization of the binding\nenergy obtained at the presented level of approximation\nis inadequate to correctly include the two-body physics.\nThis behavior is in sharp contrast to the Bose-Bose resonant interaction, where the correct binding energy is\npreserved at the HFB level [24]. This is also true for the\nFermi-Fermi case [37].\nThis discrepancy is due to the fact that the creation of\nmolecules requires the formation of correlations between\nbosons and fermions, which, as shown in the following,\ncannot exist if the density matrix is assumed to be Gaussian. Specifically what is required is a more careful consideration of the noncondensed bosons\n\nPopulation\n\nPopulation\n\nA relevant quantity we can calculate to this end is the\nbinding energy of the molecules. This can be done by an\ninstantaneous jump of the detuning from large and positive values, where we know the equilibrium distributions\nvery well, to some other arbitrary value. The system thus\nperturbed oscillates at a specific characteristic frequency,\nwhich identifies as the (unique) pole of the HFB many\nbody T-matrix of the system. For negative detunings,\nas shown below, this pole corresponds to the binding energy of the molecules, dressed by the interactions in the\nsystem.\n\n0.84\n0.828\n\n0.824\n\n1.0\n\n0.83\n\n1.1\n\n1.05\n\ntime (ms)\n\n0.82\n0\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\nmany characteristics of the system, which we could use\nto understand further physics or, more importantly at\nthis stage, to test the theory against our knowledge of\nthe system in various limits.\n\n2.5\n\n5\ntime (ms)\n\n10\n\n7.5\n\n1\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n-7\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\nEnergy (K)\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\nFIG. 1: The top panel represents the time evolution of the\npopulation of condensed atoms after detuning is suddenly\nshifted from infinitely positive to -5.1 K (\u2212.1G magnetic\ndetuning). The bottom panel shows the absolute value of\nFourier transform of said time evolution. the main peak in\nthis graph represents the computed value of the binding energy, which we see is about 5.410\u22126 K. The system under\nconsideration is composed of fermionic densities of 1012 cm\u22123 ,\nfor a constant density ratio of five bosons per fermion.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF BOSONIC\nDEPLETION\n\nThe reason for the failure of the HFB theory is not\nimmediately clear from the theory itself. To bring out\nthe inadequacy of this theory in the dilute limit, we now\nrecast the problem in an alternative perturbative form\nthat can reproduce the correct behavior in the two body\nlimit. This path integral approach will also lay bare the\nrole of noncondensed bosons.\nWhat we will see in the upcoming analysis may be\nqualitatively understood in the following simple terms.\nA molecule in the gas can decay into a pair of \"virtual\"\n(i.e. non energy conserving) atoms, which can then meet\nagain and reform the molecule. The incidence of these\nevents modifies the behavior of the molecule, and an appropriate treatment of these virtual excitations is therefore necessary to correctly include the two body properties of the molecules in the many body theory. In\nparticular, the molecules can decay forming a virtual\nnon condensed boson, and the contribution of this set\nof events to the physics of the molecules turns out to be\nvery important. An appropriate theory would therefore\nconsider the coupling of the molecules to non condensed\nbosons explicitly, which implies that one has to include\n\n\f6\n3-body correlation functions differently depending on the\nquantum statistics of the constituents. For a BoseBose mixture, the correlation function is approximated\n(schematically) by\nhbbmi \u2248 hmihb(\u2212q)b(q)i + 2hbihbmi.\n\n(10)\n\nThe first term of the right of this expression allows explicitly for virtual bosonic pairs of arbitrary momentum,\nprovided that the molecular field hmi accounts for most\nof the molecules, which is assumed to be the case. Similarly, in a mixture of distinct fermions, the correlation\nfunction reads\nhf1 f2 mi \u2248 hmihf1 (q)f2 (\u2212q)i,\nFIG. 2: Plot representing the poles of the scattering t-matrix\nfor the 511G 87 Rb - 40 K Feshbach resonance. The dotted\nline represents the \"bare\" molecular detuning as a function of\nfield, as defined in the text. The solid black line is the correct\nbinding energy of the molecular state, obtained by means of\nfull close coupling calculations, while the gray solid lines are\nthe eigenenergies obtained from equations 9.a-9.d, for different atomic densities. From top to bottom on the right the\ngrey lines refer to fermionic densities of 1010 cm\u22123 ,1011 cm\u22123 ,\nand 1012 cm\u22123 , for a constant density ratio of five bosons per\nfermion. We note that for lower and lower densities the calculated binding energy incorrectly approaches the bare detuning\ninstead of the correct two-body binding energy.\n\nin the equations of motion three point averages, such\nas < c\u2020q a\u2212p+q/2 b(p+q/2) >. Since the HFB theory disregards three point averages, it only contains moleculeatom-atom couplings of the form < c\u2020q aq > \u03c60 , where\nmolecules can only decay forming a condensed boson.\nIt is straightforward to see that the HFB theory treats\n\n(11)\n\nand the same argument applies, since the molecules are\nbosons.\nFor the Bose-Fermi mixture, on the other hand, the\ncorrelation function would be approximated by\nhbf mi \u2248 hbihf mi + hf ihbmi + hmihbf i.\n(12)\nThe required virtual atom-atom pairs would arise from\nthe third term on the right-hand-side of this expression.\nHowever, these molecules are fermions, which have no\nmean field, hmi = 0. The only surviving term is then the\nfirst one, which accounts only for condensed bosons, and\nsomehow correlates the fermionic atoms to the fermionic\nmolecules. This is only an indirect way to get the bosons\nand fermions correlated.\n\n1.\n\nTwo-Body Scattering\n\nThe perturbative analysis begins by recasting the\nHamiltonian in eq.

The equations which remain are ambiguous, which leaves us with a set of possibilities for the choice of \u1e21 and \u03bd\u0304. One way is to proceed\nas follows: insert eq. (24) into (23), and solve for \u03bd\u0304, to\nget\nmbf \u039bVbg mbf \u039b \u03bd\n)( 2 + ).\n(25)\n\u03c02\n\u03c0\ng\nFrom inspecting the above equation we can choose a\ndefinition of \u1e21, which will also imply one for \u03bd\u0304, and we\nget (reporting also eq.(24) for completeness)\n\u03bd\u0304 = \u1e21 2 (1 \u2212\n\nwhere S(E) is the S matrix given by\nS(E) = e\n\n\u221a\n\n\u22122i\n\n2mbf E abf\n\n\u221a\nHere \u0393 E is the width of the resonance, \u01eb0 is a shift associated with the detuning with respect to threshold of the\nresonance, and abf is the s-wave scattering length for the\nboson-fermion collision; all of these quantities can be extracted from experimental observables, through accurate\ntwo-body scattering calculations.\nFrom the parametrization of the zero energy T-matrix\nin eq.(5),\n\u221a and the E \u2192 0 limit of (21), we easily derive\n\u0393 = 2mBF aBF \u03b4\u03bc \u2206B. With these definitions we can\nrelate equations (21) and (20), to find a regularization\nscheme for the theory, by substituting the non observable\nparameters g, \u03bd, and Vbg by the \u039b dependent (renormalized) quantities \u1e21, \u03bd\u0304, and V \u0304bg , such that the observable\nT-matrix will not be itself \u039b dependent\nFollowing [27] we compare equations (20) and (21), in\nthe limit E \u2192 0, where we have (once we include the\ndefinitions of the bare quantities)\nVbg\n\nV \u0304bg = Vbg\n\n!\n\u221a\n2i\u0393 E,\n\u221a\n1\u2212\n.

The first limit is far from resonance,\nwhere \u03bd \u2192 \u221e\n!\n1\n \u0304\n(24)\nVbg = Vbg\nm \u039bV\n1 \u2212 bf\u03c02 bg\n\n\u1e21 = g\n\n1\u2212\n\nmbf \u039bVbg\n\u03c02\n\n1\nm\n\n\u039bV\n\n1 \u2212 bf\u03c02 bg\nmbf \u039bVbg\n\u03bd\u0304 = \u03bd + \u1e21g\n\u03c02\n\n!\n\n!\n(26)\n\nUsing these definitions of V \u0304bg , \u1e21 and \u03bd\u0304, together with the\npolicy of imposing \u039b as the upper limit of momentum\nintegrals, will guarantee that observables will not depend\non the choice of \u039b, as long as it is chosen to be bigger\nthan momentum scales relevant to experiment.\n\n2.\n\nMany-Body Generalization\n\nGeneralizing the above treatment from two to many\nparticles, we must now account for the fact that, in a\nmany-body system the molecular self energy is modified\nby the environment. Unlike in the scattering problem,\nthe procedure outlined in the previous section is only\nan approximation to the full many body problem, but\nas some evidence seems to suggest, a pretty good one\n[39, 40].\nTo perform this generalization, one needs to calculate\nthe many body self energy using the many body free\n0\ngreen functions DMB\n(\u03c9, p) and G0MB , respectively for\nbosons and fermions, defined as [41]\n\n1\nh\u0304\u03c9 \u2212 \u01ebB\n+\n\u03bcB + i0+\np\n1\nG0MB (\u03c9, p) =\n,\nF\nh\u0304\u03c9 \u2212 \u01ebp + \u03bcB + i0+ sign(\u01ebF\nb \u2212 \u03bcB )\n0\nDMB\n(\u03c9, p) = |\u03c6|2 +\n\n1\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\n\f9\nwhere \u03bcB(F ) is the bosonic (fermionic) chemical potential. The molecular self energy becomes\n\u03a3M B(\u03a9, p) = \u2212ig 2\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9 d3 q\nD0 (q, \u03c9)G0 (p \u2212 q, \u03a9 \u2212 \u03c9) =\n2\u03c0 (2\u03c0)3\n\n\u03a3MB\n(\u03a9, p) + \u03a3MB\n(\u03a9, p) = \u2212ig 2 |\u03c6|2 G0 (\u03a9, p)\n0\n\u03b4\nZ \u039b\n1\nd3 q\n;\n+g 2\n3 \u03a9 \u2212 \u01ebB \u2212 \u01ebF\n(2\u03c0)\np\u2212kf\nq\np\u2212q + \u03bcF + \u03bcB\n\nthe two terms in this expression represent contributions from condensed (\u03a3MB\n(\u03a9, p)) and noncondensed\n0\n(\u03a3MB\n(\u03a9,\np))bosons,\nrespectively.\n\u03b4\nThe (approximate) many body self energy in eq. 29\ncan be easily shown to reduce to its correct two body\ncounterpart defined in eq. (19), when the densities and\nchemical potentials are set to zero. However, if the contribution due to the non-condensed bosons \u03a3MB\nis omitted,\n\u03b4\nthen \u03a3MB clearly vanishes in the two-body limit, \u03c6 \u2192 0.\nThere would then be no renormalization of the molecular\npropagator, and the pole of the T-matrix would coincide\nwith the bare detuning, as shown in fig. 2.\nWe remind the reader that neglecting the noncondensed component of the bosonic field was a perfectly\nwell justified approximation of eqs.(8.a)-(8.i), which implies that those equations are already inadequate to reproduce the two body binding energies in the low density\nlimit. Indeed the part of resonant term in the Hamiltonian containing the bosonic fluctuations vanishes according to Wicks theorem, since it is an average of a three operator correlation with respect to a density matrix which\nis Gaussian, in the HFB approximation. To correct this\nproblem one should extend the HFB approximation and\nexplicitly include three, and possibly higher, particle cumulants, finding some other way to truncate the BBGKY\nhierarchy. The subtleties involved in such a calculation,\nhowever, are many, and non trivial, and will be the subject of further work.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have performed a study the non-equilibrium behavior in Bose-Fermi mixtures subject to an interspecies\nFeshbach resonance, Using the HFB approximation. We\nhave found that this approximation is not adequate to\ndescribe the system, which is quite remarkable since it\nhas become one of the standard approaches to resonant\ncold atom physics due to its successes in Bose gases and\ntwo component Fermi gases.\nThe reason of this failure is found in the way in which\nthe theory treats non-condensed bosons. This problem\ncould be corrected by the explicit inclusion of three (and\npossibly higher) point cumulants, which will allow for\na mechanism through which bosons and fermions could\ncorrelate to form molecules. This task, however is beyond\nthe scope of the current investigation.\n\n(29)\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of the DOE\nand the NSF, as well as the W. M.
