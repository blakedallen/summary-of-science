Based on this\nstudy, we argue that, if indeed \u2206Ms turns out to be in its currently-favored range,\nthis would disfavor a large class of supersymmetric models. Indeed, of all the models\nexamined here, the best fit to the data occurs for the standard model.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the principal aims of flavor physics is to measure the parameters of the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix [1], which encodes the manner in which\nquark mixing takes place within the Standard Model (SM). There are many measurements which contribute to this goal. For example, the matrix element Vud can\nbe probed through the study of neutron \u03b2 decay, while the Bd0 \u2013Bd0 mass difference\n\u2206Md can be used to determine the matrix element Vtd . Our present knowledge of\nthe CKM matrix is usually displayed in terms of the allowed region of the so-called\nunitarity triangle [2]. Ongoing experiments studying B-hadron physics will be able\nto test the CKM matrix by measuring the sides and the (CP-violating) angles of the\nunitarity triangle. If physics beyond the SM is present, inconsistencies in the various\nunitarity tests will appear. If this occurs, then it will be necessary to perform an\noverall fit of the CKM matrix elements in various competing theories in order to\nestablish the right framework for flavor physics.\nOne appealing candidate theory which may induce such \"unitarity inconsistencies\" is supersymmetry (SUSY). In its minimal flavor-violating form, the couplings of\nSUSY particles to ordinary matter are proportional to CKM matrix elements. Thus,\nthe weak phases of supersymmetric contributions to loop-induced transitions are the\nsame as in the SM. These loop-level processes include Bd0 \u2013Bd0 and Bs0 \u2013Bs0 mixing,\nas well as the flavor-changing neutral-current decays b \u2192 s\u03b3 and b \u2192 sl+ l\u2212 . The\npresence of such additional SUSY contributions has the effect that the extracted\nvalues of the matrix elements |Vtd | and |Vts | will be modified from their SM values. Conversely, precise measurements of the CKM matrix elements may put severe\nbounds on new physics, including SUSY. In Ref. [3], we demonstrated this quantitatively: we worked out the profile of the CKM unitarity triangle in the SM and in\nseveral variants of minimal flavor-violating supersymmetric models. We also examined the correlations among the CP-violating phases \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 in these models.\nAlthough, at the present time, all models give reasonable fits to the data, in the\nfuture, with more precise data, one will be able to distinguish among the various\ncandidate models.\nIf one compares the allowed region of the unitarity triangle of today with that\nof the early 1990's [4] it is clear that the current region is considerably smaller.\nAlthough the errors on virtually all measurements have decreased since the early\n1990's, the single most important improvement has been the measurement of \u2206Ms\nin Bs0 \u2013Bs0 mixing. As the lower limit on \u2206Ms has increased over the years, more\nand more of the earlier-allowed region has been cut away. Indeed, this lower limit\ncontinues to increase: although the lower limit in 1999 was \u2206Ms > 12.4 ps\u22121 , it\nnow stands at \u2206Ms > 14.9 ps\u22121 [5]. More intriguing, there is now a hint of a\npossible signal at \u2206Ms \u2243 17.7 ps\u22121 [5]. Clearly, the last word on \u2206Ms from the\ncombined LEP/SLD/CDF analysis is yet to come, and it is conceivable that the\nmeasurement of \u2206Ms is just around the corner. In anticipation of this, and to\nunderscore the importance of the \u2206Ms measurement for CKM phenomenology, in\nthis paper we present two analyses. First, we update the CKM fits in the SM\nand in the supersymmetric models mentioned above. Second, we assume a (future)\nmeasurement of \u2206Ms = 17.7 \u00b1 1.4 ps\u22121 , and examine the consequences. As we\nwill see, such a measurement would be sufficient to disfavor a large class of minimal\n1\n\n\fflavor-violating supersymmetric models (though it would be completely consistent\nwith the SM).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present the year-2000\nprofile of the unitarity triangle, both in the SM and in supersymmetric theories with\nminimal flavor violation. As we will see, the measurement of \u03b2 will not distinguish\namong these various models, though the measurement of \u03b1 and/or \u03b3 will. More\nto the point, in supersymmetric models one can obtain a very different allowed\nrange for \u2206Ms , so that a precision measurement of this quantity will be able to\nstrongly constrain the SUSY parameter space. This is shown quantitatively in Sec.\n3. Here we present a future profile of the unitarity triangle, both in the SM and\nin SUSY, assuming a hypothetical measurement of \u2206Ms = 17.7 \u00b1 1.4 ps\u22121 . Such a\nmeasurement would disfavor a certain class of SUSY models. Furthermore, it turns\nout that, of all the models considered here, the SM yields the best fit to the data.\nThus, the hint of a signal at \u2206Ms = 17.7 ps\u22121 is not in any way in conflict with\nthe SM. (Of course, there is still a large class of SUSY models which provides a\nreasonable fit to the data.) We conclude in Sec. 4.\n\n2\n\nUnitarity Triangle: Year-2000 Profile\n\nIt is customary to use an approximate parametrization of the CKM matrix, due to\nWolfenstein [6], to quantitatively discuss the allowed region of the unitarity triangle.\nThe Wolfenstein parametrization can be written as\n1 \u2212 21 \u03bb2\n\u03bb\n1\nV \u2243\uf8ec\n\uf8ed \u2212\u03bb(1 + iA2 \u03bb4 \u03b7) 1 \u2212 2 \u03bb2\nA\u03bb3 (1 \u2212 \u03c1 \u2212 i\u03b7) \u2212A\u03bb2\n\uf8eb\n\nA\u03bb3 (\u03c1 \u2212 i\u03b7)\n\uf8f7\nA\u03bb2\n\uf8f8 .\n1\n\uf8f6\n\n(1)\n\nThus, \u03bb, A, \u03c1 and \u03b7 are the four quantities which parametrize the CKM matrix.\nWith the experimental precision expected in future B (and K) decays, it may\nbecome necessary to go beyond leading order in \u03bb in the Wolfenstein parametrization\ngiven above. To this end, we follow here the prescription of Buras et al. [7]: defining\n\u03c1\u0304 \u2261 \u03c1(1 \u2212 \u03bb2 /2) and \u03b7\u0304 \u2261 \u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03bb2 /2), we have\nVus = \u03bb,\n\nVcb = A\u03bb2 ,\n\nVub = A\u03bb3 (\u03c1 \u2212 i\u03b7),\n\nVtd = A\u03bb3 (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304 \u2212 i\u03b7\u0304)\n\n(2)\n\n(Note that the matrix elements Vus , Vcb and Vub remain unchanged, but Vtd is renormalized in going from leading order to next-to-leading order.) The apex of the\nunitarity triangle is now defined by the renormalized Wolfenstein parameters (\u03c1\u0304, \u03b7\u0304).\n\n2.1\n\nInput Data\n\nThere are a variety of measurements which constrain \u03c1\u0304 and \u03b7\u0304, either directly or\nindirectly. The theoretical and experimental quantities which are used in the CKM\nfits are listed in Table 1, along with their present values and errors (if applicable). For\na detailed description of these quantities, as well as a discussion of our methodology,\nwe refer the reader to Ref.

The ratio of these mass differences can be expressed in the\nSM as:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03b7\u0302Bs MBs fB2 s B\u0302Bs Vts 2\n\u2206Ms\n\u03be2\n1\n\u0011\n\u0010\n= C s2\n=\n.\n(3)\n\u2206Md\n\u03bb (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304)2 + \u03b7\u0304 2\n\u03b7\u0302Bd MBd fB2 B\u0302Bd Vtd\nd\n\nSince the QCD correction factors satisfy \u03b7\u0302Bs = \u03b7\u0302Bd = 0.55 [9], and since C =\nuncertainty\nin this quantity is the ratio of\nMBs /MBd = 1.017 [2], the only real\nq\nq\n\nhadronic matrix elements \u03bes \u2261 (fBs B\u0302Bs )/(fBd B\u0302Bd ). It is now widely accepted\nthat the ratio \u03bes is probably the most reliable of the lattice-QCD estimates in B\nphysics, \u03bes = 1.16 \u00b1 0.05 [10]. Thus, the accurate knowledge of \u2206Ms /\u2206Md puts\na stringent constraint on the CKM parameters \u03c1\u0304 and \u03b7\u0304, and hence on the allowed\nregion of the unitarity triangle.\nSince \u2206Md has already been measured very accurately (the present world average is \u2206Md = 0.487 \u00b1 0.014 ps\u22121 [5]), a measurement of \u2206Ms is being keenly\nawaited. The present experimental situation on \u2206Ms can be summarized as follows:\nthe combined analysis of the LEP/SLD/CDF measurements undertaken by the Boscillation working group yields a lower bound \u2206Ms > 14.9 ps\u22121 (at 95% C.L.) [5],\nusing the amplitude analysis method of Moser and Rousarie [11]. However, quite\ninterestingly, the same analysis also yields a local minimum in the log-likelihood distribution around \u2206Ms = 17.7 ps\u22121 , whose significance becomes more pronounced\nif the amplitude spectrum is converted to a log-likelihood function referenced to\n2\n\u2206Ms = \u221e: \u2206 log L\u221e (\u2206Ms ) = (0.5 \u2212 A)/\u03c3A\n[12]. Here A is an amplitude modulating the oscillating terms as (1 \u00b1 A cos \u2206Ms t), with \u03c3A being its error. This local\n3\n\n\fminimum has the interpretation that at this value of \u2206Ms , the amplitude A is away\nfrom being zero (no-mixing case) by 2.5\u03c3. The statistical significance of this result\nhas been studied in a monte-carlo based analysis by Boix and Abbaneo [13]. They\nestimate the probability that the observed result was produced by a statistical fluctuation anywhere in the scanned values of \u2206Ms to be 1 \u2212 C.L. \u2243 2.5% [5]. Although\nthis probability is not yet small enough to consider this to be a measurement of\n\u2206Ms , the result is intriguing.\nThe other quantity which must be mentioned is sin 2\u03b2. Since a non-zero value\nof sin 2\u03b2 would be the first evidence for CP violation outside the kaon system,\nmany experiments are attempting to measure this quantity. In the Wolfenstein\nparametrization, \u2212\u03b2 is the phase of the CKM matrix element Vtd . From Eq. (1) one\ncan readily find that\n2\u03b7\u0304(1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304)\nsin 2\u03b2 =\n.\n(4)\n(1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304)2 + \u03b7\u0304 2\nThus, a measurement of sin 2\u03b2 would put a strong constraint on the parameters \u03c1\u0304\nand \u03b7\u0304.\nIn fact, first measurements of sin 2\u03b2 have already been reported, and the present\nstatus is summarized below:\nsin 2\u03b2 =\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n3.2+1.8\n\u22122.0 \u00b1 0.5 (OPAL [14]),\n0.79+0.41\n\u22120.44 (CDF [15]),\n0.84+0.83\n\u22121.04 \u00b1 0.16 (ALEPH [16]),\n+0.43 +0.07\n0.45\u22120.44 \u22120.09 (BELLE [17]),\n0.12 \u00b1 0.37 \u00b1 0.09 (BABAR [18]),\n\n(5)\n\nyielding a world average sin 2\u03b2 = 0.48+0.22\n\u22120.24 [19]. This quantity will eventually be very\nprecisely measured at the ongoing B-factory experiments and elsewhere. However,\nsince the error is still quite large, we do not include this measurement in our fits.\n\n2.2\n\nSM Fits\n\nIn order to find the allowed region in \u03c1\u0304\u2013\u03b7\u0304 space, i.e. the allowed shapes of the\nunitarity triangle, the computer program MINUIT is used to fit the parameters to\nall the experimental constraints.\nIn the fit, we allow ten parameters to vary: \u03c1\u0304, \u03b7\u0304,\nq\nA, mt , mc , \u03b7cc , \u03b7ct , fBd B\u0302Bd , B\u0302K , and \u03bes . The \u2206Ms constraint is included using\nthe amplitude method [11]. The allowed (95% C.L.) \u03c1\u0304\u2013\u03b7\u0304 region is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe triangle drawn is to facilitate our discussions, and corresponds to the central\nvalues of the fits, (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) = (95\u25e6 , 22\u25e6 , 63\u25e6 ).\nThe CP angles \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 can be measured in CP-violating rate asymmetries\nin B decays. These angles can be expressed in terms of \u03c1\u0304 and \u03b7\u0304. Thus, different\nshapes of the unitarity triangle are equivalent to different values of the CP angles.\nReferring to Fig. 1, the allowed ranges at 95% C.L. are given by\n77\u25e6 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 127\u25e6 ,\n\n14\u25e6 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 35\u25e6 ,\n\n34\u25e6 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 81\u25e6 ,\n\n(6)\n\nor, equivalently,\n\u2212 0.96 \u2264 sin 2\u03b1 \u2264 0.45 ,\n\n0.46 \u2264 sin 2\u03b2 \u2264 0.94 ,\n4\n\n0.31 \u2264 sin2 \u03b3 \u2264 0.98 . (7)\n\n\fFigure 1: Allowed region in \u03c1\u0304\u2013\u03b7\u0304 space in the SM, from a fit to the ten parameters\ndiscussed in the text and given in Table 1. The solid line represents the region with\n\u03c72 = \u03c72min + 6 corresponding to the 95% C.L. region. The triangle shows the best\nfit.\nOf course, the values of \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 are correlated, i.e. they are not all allowed\nsimultaneously. After all, the sum of these angles must equal 180\u25e6. We illustrate\nthese correlations in Figs. 2 and 3. In both of these figures, the SM plot is labelled\nby f = 0. Fig. 2 shows the allowed region in sin 2\u03b1\u2013sin 2\u03b2 space allowed by the data,\nwhile Fig. 3 shows the allowed (correlated) values of the CP angles \u03b1 and \u03b3. This\ncorrelation is roughly linear, due to the relatively small allowed range of \u03b2 [Eq. (6)].\nFinally, one can also calculate the range of \u2206Ms which is presently allowed in\nthe SM. At 95% C.L. we find:\n14.6 \u2264 \u2206Ms \u2264 31.2 .\n\n2.3\n\n(8)\n\nSUSY Fits\n\nIn this subsection we update the profile of the unitarity triangle in supersymmetric\n(SUSY) theories with minimal flavor violation. In this class of models, the SUSY\ncontributions to \u2206Md , \u2206Ms and |\u01eb| can all be described by a single common parameter f (for a more detailed discussion, we refer the reader to Ref. [3]):\n\u2206Md = \u2206Md (SM)[1 + f ],\n\u2206Ms = \u2206Ms (SM)[1 + f ],\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\nG2F fK2 MK MW\n2 6\n\u221a\n|\u01eb| =\nB\u0302\nA\n\u03bb\n\u03b7\u0304\n(yc {\u03b7\u0302ct f3 (yc , yt ) \u2212 \u03b7\u0302cc }\nK\n6 2\u03c0 2 \u2206MK\n+\n\u03b7\u0302tt yt f2 (yt )[1 + f ]A2 \u03bb4 (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304)).\n\n(9)\n\nThe parameter f is positive definite, so that the supersymmetric contributions add\nconstructively to the SM contributions in the entire allowed supersymmetric parameter space. The size of f depends, in general, on the parameters of the supersymmetric model. In our fits, we will consider four representative values of f - 0,\n5\n\n\fFigure 2: Allowed 95% C.L. region of the CP-violating quantities sin 2\u03b1 and sin 2\u03b2,\nfrom a fit to the data given in Table 1.

From left to right, the allowed regions\ncorrespond to f = 0 (SM, solid line), f = 0.2 (long dashed line), f = 0.4 (short\ndashed line), f = 0.75 (dotted line).\n0.2, 0.4 and 0.75 - which are typical of the SM, minimal supergravity (SUGRA)\nmodels, non-minimal SUGRA models, and non-SUGRA models, respectively.\nFor the SUSY fits, we use the same program as for the SM fits, except that the\ntheoretical expressions for \u2206Md , \u2206Ms and |\u01eb| are modified as above [Eq. (9)]. The\nallowed 95% C.L. regions for the four values f = 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.75 are all plotted\nin Fig. 4. We can see from this figure that, as f increases, the allowed region moves\nslightly down and towards the right in the \u03c1\u0304\u2013\u03b7\u0304 plane.\nAt present, there is still considerable overlap between the f = 0 (SM) and\nf = 0.75 regions. However, there are also regions allowed for one value of f which\nare excluded for another value. In particular, one notices that, as f increases, larger\nvalues of \u03c1\u0304 are allowed. This in turn implies that larger values of \u2206Ms are allowed,\nand in fact this is borne out quantitively. The allowed ranges for \u2206Ms (95% C.L.)\nare given by:\nf = 0 (SM)\nf = 0.2\nf = 0.4\nf = 0.75\n\n:\n:\n:\n:\n\n14.6 \u2264 \u2206Ms\n14.6 \u2264 \u2206Ms\n14.9 \u2264 \u2206Ms\n15.1 \u2264 \u2206Ms\n\n\u2264 31.2\n\u2264 35.5\n\u2264 39.4\n\u2264 48.6\n\n,\n,\n,\n.\n\n(10)\n\nAlthough the lower limit on \u2206Ms is roughly independent of f , the upper limit\nincreases as f increases. Thus, should \u2206Ms be found to be very large, this would be\nconsistent with SUSY models with large values of f . Conversely, if \u2206Ms is measured\nto be near its lower limit, this would disfavor SUSY models with large f . (Note that,\nalthough small values of \u2206Ms are allowed in such models, the region of parameter\nspace which yields such values is relatively small. Thus, one can expect the fits to\nthe data to be poorer for SUSY models with large values of f than for models with\nsmall f . We will see this in more detail in Sec. 3.)\nAs was seen in the SM fit, different shapes of the unitarity triangle correspond\n7\n\n\fTable 2: Allowed 95% C.L. ranges for the CP phases \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3, as well as their\ncentral values, from the CKM fits in the SM (f = 0) and supersymmetric theories,\ncharacterized by the parameter f defined in the text.\nf\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b3\n(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)cent\nf\nf\nf\nf\n\n= 0 (SM)\n= 0.2\n= 0.4\n= 0.75\n\n77\u25e6\n80\u25e6\n82\u25e6\n87\u25e6\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n127\u25e6\n133\u25e6\n138\u25e6\n146\u25e6\n\n14\u25e6\n13\u25e6\n12\u25e6\n10\u25e6\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n35\u25e6\n34\u25e6\n34\u25e6\n35\u25e6\n\n34\u25e6\n29\u25e6\n25\u25e6\n20\u25e6\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n81\u25e6\n81\u25e6\n78\u25e6\n74\u25e6\n\n(95\u25e6 , 22\u25e6 , 63\u25e6)\n(109\u25e6 , 22\u25e6, 49\u25e6 )\n(112\u25e6 , 20\u25e6, 48\u25e6 )\n(114\u25e6 , 21\u25e6, 45\u25e6 )\n\nTable 3: Allowed 95% C.L. ranges for the CP asymmetries sin 2\u03b1, sin 2\u03b2 and sin2 \u03b3,\nfrom the CKM fits in the SM (f = 0) and supersymmetric theories, characterized\nby the parameter f defined in the text.\nf\nsin 2\u03b1\nsin 2\u03b2\nsin2 \u03b3\nf\nf\nf\nf\n\n= 0 (SM)\n= 0.2\n= 0.4\n= 0.75\n\n\u22120.96\n\u22121.00\n\u22121.00\n\u22121.00\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n0.45\n0.35\n0.26\n0.11\n\n0.46\n0.44\n0.42\n0.36\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n0.94\n0.93\n0.93\n0.94\n\n0.31\n0.24\n0.19\n0.12\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n0.98\n0.97\n0.96\n0.93\n\nto different values of the CP phases \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3. Furthermore, these allowed values\nare correlated: the correlations between sin 2\u03b1 and sin 2\u03b2, and between \u03b1 and \u03b3,\nare shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively. Tables 2 and 3 give, respectively,\nthe allowed ranges for the CP phases and the quantities measured in CP-violating\nasymmetries. The key observation here is that a measurement of the CP angle \u03b2\nwill not distinguish among the various values of f \u2013 the allowed range for \u03b2 is rather\nindependent of f . If one wants to distinguish among the various SUSY models, it\nwill be necessary to measure \u03b1 and/or \u03b3. (Of course, as mentioned above, there is\nstill significant overlap among all four models. Thus, depending on what values of\n\u03b1 and \u03b3 are obtained, we may or may not be able to rule out certain values of f .)\n\n3\n\nUnitarity Triangle: Future Profile\n\nAs was discussed in Sec. 2.1, the Bs0 \u2013Bs0 mixing data appears to contain a 2.5\u03c3 signal\ncentered at \u2206Ms = 17.7 ps\u22121 . This signal is not statistically significant enough to\nbe considered a measurement of \u2206Ms . However, it is still interesting to consider\nwhat the effect would be on the profile of the unitarity triangle, both in the SM and\nin SUSY models, if this signal persisted and became a measurement. This is the\npurpose of this section.\nIn order to be consistent with both the central value of \u2206Ms and its 95% C.L.\nlower limit (14.9 ps\u22121 ), we assume the hypothetical future measurement of this\nquantity to be\n\u2206Ms = 17.7 \u00b1 1.4 ps\u22121 .\n(11)\n\nThe SM and SUSY fits are then performed with this as part of the input data.\n8\n\n\fFigure 5: Allowed 95% C.L. region in \u03c1\u2013\u03b7 space in the SM and in SUSY models, in\nthe hypothetical scenario in which \u2206Ms is given by Eq. (11). From top to bottom,\nthe allowed regions correspond to f = 0 (SM, solid line), f = 0.2 (long dashed line),\nf = 0.4 (short dashed line), f = 0.75 (dotted line).\nThe results are shown in Fig. 5. The effect of the \u2206Ms constraint is quite striking:\nthe minimum- and maximum-allowed values of \u03c1\u0304 are essentially independent of f .\nNow, as f increases, the allowed region only moves slightly down in the \u03c1\u0304\u2013\u03b7\u0304 plane.\nHowever, Fig. 5 does not tell the whole story. In particular, it does not take\ninto account how good the fits are for the various values of f . The goodness of fit\nis indicated by the minimum value of \u03c72 : since there are two degrees of freedom\n(\u03c1\u0304 and \u03b7\u0304), fits with \u03c72min > 2 are disfavored. In fact, the model with f = 0.75 has\n\u03c72min = 2.9, and is hence a poor fit to the data. In Fig. 6 we present \u03c72min as a\nfunction of f . This figure shows that, for the hypothetical scenario in which \u2206Ms\ngiven by Eq. (11), models with f > 0.6 are disfavored.\nIt is interesting - and perhaps somewhat discouraging - to note that the best\nfit (\u03c72min = 9.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 ) occurs for f = 0, i.e. for the standard model. That is,\nalthough some models with f 6= 0 would give reasonable fits to the data, the hint\nof a signal at \u2206Ms = 17.7 ps\u22121 does not indicate any problems whatsoever for the\nSM.\nNote also that the percentage error we have assumed for \u2206Ms , 7.9%, is considerably greater than the present experimental error on \u2206Md of 2.9%. It is not\nunreasonable to believe that the percentage error on \u2206Ms will eventually approach\nthat of \u2206Md . In that case, the precise measurement of \u2206Ms will be able to rule\nout an even greater region of SUSY parameter space. That is, values of f smaller\nthan 0.6 will be disfavored. Thus, we see that a precision measurement of \u2206Ms\nwill be an extremely powerful tool for distinguishing among the SM and its various\nsupersymmetric extensions.\nFor completeness, in Figs. 7 and 8 we present, respectively, the sin 2\u03b1\u2013sin 2\u03b2 and\n\u03b1\u2013\u03b3 correlations for the scenario in which \u2206Ms is given by Eq. (11). The allowed\nranges for the CP phases and for sin 2\u03b1, sin 2\u03b2 and sin2 \u03b3 are given in Tables 4 and 5,\nrespectively. A comparison of, for example, Tables 2 and 4 reveals that, as expected,\nthe measurement of \u2206Ms does not affect the allowed range for \u03b2 appreciably, though\n9\n\n\fFigure 6: Minimum value of \u03c72 as a function of the SUSY parameter f , for the\nfits in the hypothetical scenario in which \u2206Ms is given by Eq.

Furthermore, there is an intriguing 2.5\u03c3 hint of a signal at\n\u2206Ms \u2243 17.7 ps\u22121 . In light of this, in this paper we examine the effect that a\nmeasurement of \u2206Ms would have on the profile of the CKM matrix, both in the\nstandard model and in supersymmetric models with minimal flavor violation.\nWe first update the profile of the unitarity triangle, both in the SM and in supersymmetric models, using current experimental data. The SUSY contributions\nto \u2206Md , \u2206Ms and |\u01eb| can all be described by a single common parameter f , and\nwe take three representative values in our fits: f = 0.2, 0.4 and 0.75. The measurement of the CP-phase \u03b2 will not distinguish among the various models, though\nthe measurement of \u03b1 and/or \u03b3 may do so. More importantly, the different models\nmake different predictions for the allowed range of \u2206Ms . This indicates that the\n10\n\n\fFigure 7: Allowed 95% C.L. region of the CP-violating quantities sin 2\u03b1 and sin 2\u03b2,\nin the hypothetical scenario in which \u2206Ms is given by Eq. (11).

In this case, we find that SUSY\nmodels with f > 0.6 provide poor fits to the data, and are hence disfavored. Thus,\nwe see that the measurement of \u2206Ms is indeed a powerful tool for discriminating\nbetween the SM and its supersymmetric extensions.\nFor the particular experimental value of \u2206Ms that we have assumed - and we\nhave chosen this value to be consistent with the lower 95% C.L. bound, as well as\nwith the hint of a signal - the best fit to the data occurs for f = 0, i.e. for the\nSM. Thus, present data on Bs0 \u2013Bs0 mixing does not indicate any problems with the\nSM, which may be somewhat discouraging for those who hope to see signals for new\nphysics via CKM phenomenology.\nFinally, it is not unreasonable to expect that the percentage error on a measurement of \u2206Ms will eventually reach the same level as that of \u2206Md (i.e. \u223c 3%).\nWhen this happens, the precise measurement of \u2206Ms will be able to rule out an\neven greater region of SUSY parameter space. (Or, if the central value changes, one\ncould conceivably rule out the SM!) Once again, this emphasizes the importance of\na measurement of \u2206Ms for searching for new flavor physics.\nAcknowledgements: We would like to thank John Jaros, Fabrizio Parodi, and\nAchille Stocchi for very helpful discussions about the current measurements and fit\nprocedures used in constraining \u2206Ms .
