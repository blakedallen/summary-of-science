Gracey,\nTheoretical Physics Division,\nDepartment of Mathematical Sciences,\nUniversity of Liverpool,\nPeach Street,\nLiverpool,\nL69 7ZF,\nUnited Kingdom.\nNovember, 2001.\n\nAbstract. We renormalize the Curci-Ferrari model at two loops in the MS scheme in an\narbitrary covariant gauge.\n\n1\n\n\fThe Curci-Ferrari model is an extension of Yang-Mills theory where the gluon field, Aa\u03bc , is\nmassive, [1, 2]. However, as is well known in such a massive non-abelian gauge theory, where\nthere is no spontaneous symmetry breaking, the theory is not fully consistent. For instance, it\ndoes not obey unitarity, [2, 3, 4], though it has been shown to be multiplicatively renormalizable\nto all orders in perturbation theory, [1, 4, 5, 6]. Further, as the mass for the gluon is included in\nthe Lagrangian in the simplest possible manner, there is the possibility that gauge invariance is\nalso broken. However, as was shown in the original work of Curci and Ferrari, [1, 2], if one also\nincludes a particular form of mass term for the ghost fields when the gauge is fixed covariantly\nin a non-linear way, the mass term in the Lagrangian in fact preserves BRST symmetry, though\nwithout restoring unitarity which remains broken. Despite the lack of unitarity the CurciFerrari model has been of interest recently for a variety of reasons. First, there have been\nseveral investigations into how a mass gap for the gluon can arise, [7, 8, 9]. For example, in\n[8, 9] a gluon and ghost mass term akin to that which occurs in the Curci-Ferrari model has been\nargued to be important in generating a mass gap in ordinary Yang-Mills theories. For instance,\na non-zero vacuum expectation value for h 21 (Aa\u03bc )2 + \u03b1c\u0304a ca i emerges under certain assumptions\nwhere \u03b1 is the covariant gauge parameter and ca and c\u0304a are the respective ghost and anti-ghost\nfields. Such an operator represents the simplest local dimension two operator which can be\nconstructed in non-abelian gauge field theories. Also, a similar approach has been considered in\n[7] where the effective potential of the Landau gauge condensate is constructed. There it was\nshown that at two loops the non-perturbative vacuum favoured a non-zero value for the vacuum\nexpectation value. Other studies include [10]. Second, the model itself has provided a useful\nlaboratory for studying gauge theories with a non-linear gauge fixing, [5, 11]. Third, massive\nYang-Mills models have been used to model the phenomenology of the strong interactions. For\nexample, such a model was used in [12] to try and understand diffractive scattering. Finally, the\nmain motivation for our interest in the Curci-Ferrari model stems from the role of the gluon mass\nas a natural infrared regulator for Feynman integrals which arise in loop calculations, [13, 6, 14].\nIn the renormalization of QCD at high loop orders the standard method of extracting the\nultraviolet divergence structure of a Feynman integral with respect to the regularization, such as\ndimensional regularization, is to perform the calculation with massless propagators. However,\nfor two and higher loop integrals one has to be careful that spurious infrared infinities are not\ngenerated. These can occur when one reduces the class of Feynman integrals to vacuum integrals\nby expanding in powers of the external momenta after one or more external momenta have been\nset to zero first. To circumvent this potential problem the technique of infrared rearrangement,\n[15, 16], is applied where a temporary mass is added to the appropriate propagators in an infrared divergent integral. Whilst this has been a hugely successful technique it suffers from the\ndrawback that it is performed by hand and hence limited when considering the large number\nof diagrams which will arise when the loop order increases. Moreover, it was not clear until\nrecently how one could develop the method for application in an automatic multiloop computer\nalgebra programme. One recent approach to address this problem is that of [17, 18]. There each\npropagator is systematically given an infrared cutoff mass so that the resulting vacuum integrals\nare automatically infrared finite. Provided all the vacuum diagrams are computable at that loop\norder then one can automatize the process. Indeed [17, 18] provides a full two loop calculation\nof various anomalous dimensions. Given that the Curci-Ferrari model naturally incorporates a\nmass akin to that introduced for infrared rearrangement and remains renormalizable it seems\nappropriate to consider and develop that model as a useful and alternative tool to compute the\nultraviolet structure of Yang-Mills theories. This is important since the efficient programmes\nsuch as Mincer, [19], compute the ultraviolet structure of only massless two-point functions at\nthree loops, but for n-point functions with n > 2 one cannot naively nullify all bar two of the\nexternal momenta, similar to infrared rearrangement, and apply Mincer. This is because this\n\n2\n\n\fprocedure will inevitably give rise to spurious infrared infinities which, in dimensional regularization, cannot be distinguished from the desired ultraviolet divergences. Hence, it would seem\nmore appropriate to us to apply the Curci-Ferrari model in these circumstances. However, it\nturns out that currently the model has only been renormalized to one loop in [4]. Moreover, an\nearlier calculation, [14], appears to incorrectly determine the renormalization constants which\nmust satisfy the appropriate Slavnov-Taylor identities. Therefore, the purpose of this letter is\nto renormalize the Curci-Ferrari model at two loops in the MS scheme using an arbitrary (nonlinear) covariant gauge fixing term and dimensional regularization. This is necessary given that\nthe renormalization constants of the fields, coupling, gauge parameter and masses are required\nfor the subsequent renormalization of any Green's function. As a consequence of our calculations\nwe will verify the result of [4] that five renormalization constants are necessary to render the\nmodel finite as opposed to the three suggested in [3].\nThe Lagrangian of the Curci-Ferrari model is, [1],\n1 \u03bc a 2\nm2 a a \u03bc\n1 a a \u03bc\u03bd\nG\u03bc\u03bd G\n\u2212\n(\u2202 A\u03bc ) \u2212\nA A\n+ \u2202\u03bc c\u0304a \u2202 \u03bc ca\n4\n2\u03b1\n2 \u03bc\n\u2194\ng\n\u03b1g 2 eab ecd a b c d\n\u2212 \u03b1m2 c\u0304a ca \u2212 f abc Aa\u03bc c\u0304b \u2202 \u03bc cc +\nf f c\u0304 c c\u0304 c\n2\n8\n\nL = \u2212\n\n(1)\n\nwhere 1 \u2264 a \u2264 NA with NA the dimension of the adjoint representation, D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + igT a Aa\u03bc ,\nGa\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd Aa\u03bc \u2212 gf abc Ab\u03bc Ac\u03bd , g is the coupling constant and m is the gluon mass. The\nghost mass is related to the gluon mass by the covariant gauge fixing parameter \u03b1. The structure\n\u2194\n\nconstants of the Lie group are f abc and c\u0304a \u2202\u03bc cb = c\u0304a \u2202\u03bc cb \u2212 (\u2202\u03bc c\u0304a )cb . Following the usual\nprocedures the gluon and ghost propagators are respectively\n\u2212 \u03b4ab\n\n\u0014\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1)k\u03bc k\u03bd\n\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212\n(k2 + m2 )\n(k2 + m2 )(k2 + \u03b1m2 )\n\n\u0015\n\nand\n\n\u03b4ab\n.\n(k2 + \u03b1m2 )\n\n(2)\n\nThe unphysical pole at \u03b1m2 in the ghost propagator had led to the hope that it would counteract\nthe same pole in the gluon propagator to establish a unitary theory. However, it has been shown,\n[1, 2, 3, 4], that this is not the case. To renormalize (1) the quantities of the bare Lagrangian,\ndenoted by the subscript o, are replaced by the renormalized ones, through,\nAao \u03bc =\n\nZA Aa \u03bc , cao =\n\np\n\nZc ca , c\u0304ao =\n\np\n\nZc c\u0304a\n\np\n\ngo = Zg g , mo = Zm m , \u03b1o = Z\u03b1\u22121 ZA \u03b1 .\n\n(3)\n\nWe have assumed initially that there are five independent renormalization constants. In ordinary Yang-Mills one has three renormalization constants since clearly there is no need for Zm\nand the Slavnov-Taylor identities ensure that Z\u03b1 = 1 in our notation to all orders to preserve\ngauge symmetry. Here we will allow for an independent Z\u03b1 as in [4]. To find each of the renormalization constants to two loops the gluon and ghost two-point functions are computed first\nwhich determine ZA , Z\u03b1 , Zc and Zm . It is worth pointing out that since the gluon two-point\nfunction gives ZA , Z\u03b1 and Zm the structure of the ghost mass renormalization is determined\nprior to calculating it. This in fact provides a strong check on our results. In addition we have\ncomputed the ghost-gluon and triple gluon vertex renormalizations to verify that the correct\nscheme independent two loop \u03b2-function emerges in both the gluon and ghost sectors. The\nrenormalization group functions are defined by, (see, for example, [20]),\n\u2202 ln Zc\n\u2202a\n\u2202 ln ZA\n, \u03b3c (a) = \u03bc\n, \u03b2(a) = \u03bc\n\u2202\u03bc\n\u2202\u03bc\n\u2202\u03bc\n\u2202 ln m\n\u2202 ln \u03b1\n, \u03b3\u03b1 (a) =\n\u2202 ln \u03bc\n\u2202 ln \u03bc\n\n\u03b3A (a) = \u03bc\n\u03b3m (a) =\n\n3\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere a = g2 /(16\u03c0 2 ). From (3) these imply\n\u2202 ln ZA\n\u2202 ln ZA\n+ \u03b1\u03b3\u03b1 (a)\n\u2202a\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u2202 ln Z\u03b1 \u22121\n\u2202 ln Z\u03b1\n\u2212 \u03b3A (a) 1 \u2212 \u03b1\n\u03b3\u03b1 (a) = \u03b2(a)\n\u2202a\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202 ln Zm\n.\n\u03b3m (a) = \u2212 \u03bc\n\u2202\u03bc\n\u03b3A (a) = \u03b2(a)\n\n(5)\n\nOrdinarily in massless Yang-Mills theory one has the simple relation \u03b3\u03b1 (a) = \u2212 \u03b3A (a). When\nthe condition Z\u03b1 = 1 is not satisfied the more general relation, (5), emerges.\nTo compute the ultraviolet structure of the two and three point functions we have followed\nthe strategy of [17, 18] of expanding out the Feynman integrals to the terms involving two or\nthree external momenta respectively. Given that the Curci-Ferrari model is renormalizable,\n[1, 4, 5, 6], it follows that terms involving more external momenta will not contribute to the\nultraviolet divergences. Hence one is left with massive vacuum two loop Feynman integrals to\ncompute where, unlike the calculation of [17, 18], the masses in the propagators are not all\nthe same. Such integrals have been widely studied before and we quote the result of [21], for\ninstance, for the basic two loop topology.

The integrals involving different powers of a propagator\nare given by differentiating with respect to the appropriate masses. It is important to realise\nthe role of the logarithmic terms. For instance, specifying various values for m2i we have\nR\n\nZ\n\nkl\n\nR\n\n1\n2\n2\n2\n(k + m )(l + m2 )[(k \u2212 l)2 + \u03b1m2 ]\n\n1\n3\n1\n+\n+ ln(4\u03c0e\u2212\u03b3 )\n2\n2\u01eb\n2\u01eb\n\u01eb\n\u0010\n\u0011 m2\n+ O(1)\n+ (\u03b1 + 2) ln m2 + \u03b1 ln \u03b1\n\u01eb\n\n= \u2212 (\u03b1 + 2)m2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(7)\n\nand\nZ\n\nkl\n\n1\n(k2 + m2 )(l2 + \u03b1m2 )[(k \u2212 l)2 + \u03b1m2 ]\n\n1\n1\n3\n+ ln(4\u03c0e\u2212\u03b3 )\n+\n2\u01eb2\n2\u01eb\n\u01eb\n\u0010\n\u0011 m2\n+ (2\u03b1 + 1) ln m2 + 2\u03b1 ln \u03b1\n+ O(1) .\n\u01eb\n(8)\n\n= \u2212 (2\u03b1 + 1)m2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\nTherefore, the final renormalization constants could potentially contain ln \u03b1 terms. Moreover,\nin writing two and three point functions in the basic form (8), one uses partial fractions so that\n1\n1\n1\n1\n=\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(k + m )(k + \u03b1m )\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1)m (k + \u03b1m )\n(k + m2 )\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(9)\n\nwhich introduces, in addition, powers of 1/(1\u2212\u03b1) which also could appear in the renormalization\nconstants. Given that ln \u03b1 and 1/(1\u2212 \u03b1)n for n \u2265 1 are singular at \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b1 = 1 respectively,\n4\n\n\fit might be expected that at two loops there will be a problem in the Landau and Feynman\ngauges respectively. However, since the original gluon propagator, (2), can be rewritten as\n\u2212 \u03b4\n\nab\n\n\u0014\n\nk\u03bc k\u03bd\n\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212\n(k2 + m2 )\nm2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2\n(k + \u03b1m )\n(k + m2 )\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n(10)\n\nthere ought to be no problems at \u03b1 = 1 which provides an internal consistency check on the\ncomputation. Moreover, the potential \u03b1 = 0 singularity is avoided by the fact that the basic\none loop integral has the following \u01eb-expansion\nZ\n\nk\n\ni\n1\n\u03b1m2 h\n2\n2\n=\n\u2212\n1\n+\n[1\n\u2212\n\u03b3\n\u2212\nln(\u03b1m\n)]\u01eb\n+\nO(\u01eb\n)\n.\n(k2 + \u03b1m2 )\n\u01eb\n\n(11)\n\nHence, the counterterms which arise from the one loop diagrams ought to cancel out the ln(\u03b1)/\u01eb\npoles arising in integrals of the type we have discussed. Indeed in this context we avoid the\nusual approach of subtractions by using the method of [22]. There one computes the Green's\nfunctions in terms of the bare parameters and then rescales them at the end of the calculation in\nterms of the coupling constant expansion of the renormalization constants, (3), where each term\nof the expansion has already been determined. This strategy is appropriate given that we have\ncarried out the calculation automatically using a symbolic manipulation programme written in\nForm, [23], in order to handle the tedious amount of algebra. The Feynman diagrams for such\nan approach were generated using Qgraf, [24].\nConsequently, we find the following MS renormalization constants for the Curci-Ferrari\nmodel, (1),\nZA =\n\nZ\u03b1 =\n\nZc =\n\nZm =\n\nZg =\n\n13 \u03b1 a\n\u2212\n1 + CA\n6\n2 \u01eb\n\"\n!\n! #\n2\n2\n3\u03b1\n\u03b1\n17\u03b1\n13\n11\u03b1\n59\n1\n1 2\n2\n+ CA\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\na + O(a3 )\n16\n24\n8 \u01eb2\n16\n16\n16 \u01eb\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03b1 a\n1 \u2212 CA\n4 \u01eb\n\"\n!\n! #\n2\n\u03b1\n\u03b12 5\u03b1 1 2\n3\u03b1 1\n2\n+ CA\n+\n\u2212\n+\na + O(a3 )\n16\n16 \u01eb2\n32\n32 \u01eb\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3 \u03b1 a\n\u2212\n1 + CA\n4\n4 \u01eb\n\"\n!\n! #\n2\n\u03b1\n\u03b12\n35 1\n\u03b1\n95 1 2\n2\n+ CA\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\na + O(a3 )\n16 32 \u01eb2\n32 32 96 \u01eb\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1 35 a\n1 + CA\n\u2212\n8\n24 \u01eb\n!\n! #\n\"\n2\n53\u03b1 1435 1\n\u03b12 11\u03b1 449 1 2\n\u03b1\n2\n\u2212\n+\n+\n\u2212\n+\na + O(a3 )\n+ CA \u2212\n128\n192\n384 \u01eb2\n64\n64\n192 \u01eb\n\u0014\n\u0015\n11\na\n17 1 2\n2 121 1\n1 \u2212\nCA + CA\n\u2212\na + O(a3 )\n(12)\n6\n\u01eb\n24 \u01eb2\n6 \u01eb\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nwhere f acd f bcd = CA \u03b4ab . As an additional check on our two loop results we note that the\nO(1/\u01eb2 ) pole terms of each renormalization constant agrees with the value predicted through\nthe renormalization group from the one loop pole. Using (5), these values for the renormalization\nconstants lead to the renormalization group functions\n\u03b3A (a) = CA (3\u03b1 \u2212 13)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011 a2\na\n2\n+ CA\n+ O(a3 )\n\u03b12 + 11\u03b1 \u2212 59\n6\n8\n\n5\n\n\f\u0010\n\u0011 a2\na\n2\n\u2212 CA\n+ O(a3 )\n\u03b12 + 17\u03b1 \u2212 118\n12\n16\n\u0010\n\u0011 a2\na\n2\n+ O(a3 )\n3\u03b12 \u2212 3\u03b1 \u2212 95\n\u03b3c (a) = CA (\u03b1 \u2212 3) + CA\n4\n48\n\u0010\n\u0011 a2\na\n2\n\u03b3m (a) = CA (3\u03b1 \u2212 35)\n+ CA\n+ O(a3 )\n3\u03b12 + 33\u03b1 \u2212 449\n24\n96\n11\n34 2 3\n\u03b2(a) = \u2212\nC A a2 \u2212\nC a + O(a4 ) .\n3\n3 A\n\n\u03b3\u03b1 (a) = \u2212 CA (3\u03b1 \u2212 26)\n\n(13)\n\nThe result for the \u03b2-function agrees with the original two loop scheme independent result of\n[25, 26]. As the gluon mass in (1) corresponds to the coupling of a gauge variant, and therefore\nunphysical, operator its mass anomalous dimension is gauge dependent. Further, the result for\n\u03b3m (a) in the Landau gauge agrees with the calculation of [7] as an additional check on our\ncomputation. It is also worth noting that the explicit sum of the gluon wave function and gauge\nfixing parameter anomalous dimensions gives\n\"\n\na2\na\n2\n(\u03b1 + 5)\n\u03b3A (a) + \u03b3\u03b1 (a) = \u03b1 CA + CA\n4\n16\n\n#\n\n+ O(a3 ) .\n\n(14)\n\nAs a final check on our results we note that in the Landau gauge \u03b3\u03b1 (a) = \u2212 \u03b3A (a) as in the\nmassless Yang-Mills theory and it is trivial to verify that the Landau gauge renormalization\ngroup functions coincide precisely with the two loop results of [25, 26, 27, 22]. In this instance\nthe gluon propagator, (2), takes the simple transverse form\nk\u03bc k\u03bd\n\u03b4ab\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b7\n\u2212\n\u2212\n(k2 + m2 )\nk2\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nFurther, if we define the ghost mass as\nm2c = \u03b1m2\n1\n\n(16)\n\n\u22121\n\nthen in general, using Zmc = Zm ZA2 Z\u03b1 2 ,\n1\n\u2202 ln Z\u03b1\n\u2202 ln Z\u03b1\n1\n+ \u03b1\u03b3\u03b1 (a)\n\u03b2(a)\n\u03b3mc (a) = \u03b3m (a) \u2212 \u03b3A (a) +\n2\n2\n\u2202a\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(17)\n\ngiving to two loops\n\u03b3mc (a) = \u2212\n\n3\na2\n2\nCA a \u2212 CA\n(18\u03b1 + 95)\n+ O(a3 ) .\n8\n96\n\n(18)\n\nTo conclude we have explicitly constructed all the basic renormalization group functions for\nthe Curci-Ferrari model, (1), at two loops in MS. These will be important for using this theory\nto renormalize Green's functions in Yang-Mills theories where one cannot readily apply current\nautomatic multiloop programmes to determine the ultraviolet structure of n-point functions with\nn > 3 and where an infrared regularization is also necessary. Further, given that QCD is more\nappropriate for practical phenomenology it would be interesting to extend our computations\nto include massive quarks in addition to the massive gluons and ghosts. Although that theory\nwould remain non-unitary, multiplicative renormalizability ought still to be preserved and hence\nthe quark extended Curci-Ferrari model would provide a useful tool for renormalizing full QCD.\nAcknowledgements.
