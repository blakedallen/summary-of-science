Whitcomb (LIGO-Caltech)\nLIGO-T0900053-v1\n\n\fIntroduction\nWithin the next decade gravitational-wave (GW) observations by Advanced LIGO [1]\nin the United States, Advanced Virgo [2] and GEO HF [32] in Europe, and possibly other\nground-based instruments will provide unprecedented opportunities to look directly into the\ndense interiors of neutron stars which are opaque to all forms of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The 10\u2013104 Hz frequency band available to these ground-based interferometers is\ninhabited by many neutron star mode frequencies, spin frequencies, and inverse dynamical timescales. GWs can provide information on bulk properties of neutron stars (masses,\nradii, locations. . . ) as well as microphysics of their substance (crystalline structure, viscosity, composition. . . ), some of which is difficult or impossible to obtain by EM observations\nalone. The former will tell us about the astrophysics of neutron stars, and the latter will\nilluminate fundamental issues in nuclear and particle physics and the physics of extremely\ncondensed matter. Although GW searches can be done \"blind,\" they become richer and\nmore informative with input from EM observations; and thus the combination of the two\nis crucial for learning the most we can about neutron stars. Healthy GW and EM observational programs must be accompanied by vigorous theoretical research on the interface of\nastrophysics, gravitational physics, nuclear and particle physics in order to extract the most\nfrom the observations.\nAdvanced LIGO has been funded and it and its international partners will not be ranked\nas part of the decadal review. Our purpose here is rather to describe the neutron-star\naspect of GW science and point out observational and theory issues in EM astronomy and\nastrophysics which connect to it, and thus are important to maximizing the scientific output\nof the advanced detectors (LIGO, Virgo, and GEO HF) and the future underground GW\ndetectors now in planning.\nOpportunities to learn about neutron stars through GW and and GW/EM observations\nnaturally divide into four categories: supernovae, binary mergers, starquakes, and continuous\nwaves. The first is addressed in another white paper [13]; here we address the other three.\n\nBinary Mergers\nAdvanced LIGO is likely to observe mergers of double neutron star (NS/NS) binaries at\na rate of a few to a few hundred per year; and black-hole/neutron-star (BH/NS) binaries\nperhaps in a comparable range of rates [18]. If the observed rates are at either extreme\nof the range, they would reflect on extremes of compact binary populations and aspects of\ntheir formation such as the properties of a common envelope phase and the distribution of\nneutron-star birth kicks, both of which can prematurely merge or disrupt binaries before the\nsecond neutron star or the black hole is formed.\nIndividual merger signals can reveal aspects of neutron star structure: For BH/NS mergers the tidal disruption of the neutron star can take place at frequencies where groundbased GW detectors are most sensitive. The latest, fully relativistic, numerical simulations\nof merger [15] confirm the earlier Newtonian intuition that the \"break frequency\" of the\nmerger signal, the frequency at which much of the neutron star is swallowed by the black\nhole and the signal becomes very faint, is strongly correlated with the neutron star radius\n1\n\n\fand therefore can serve as a good measurement of it. Beyond Advanced LIGO, or with a\nvery lucky event during the time of Advanced LIGO, a neutron star's mass can be measured\nto as well as 20% from the precessional modulation of the signal if the companion is a rapidly\nrotating black hole [27]; and a high neutron star mass would significantly constrain the star's\ncomposition. Recent analytical [16] and numerical estimates [24] of the effects of tidal deformations on NS/NS orbits (and thus the phase evolution of merger signals) indicate that the\nstrongest signals observed by Advanced LIGO might yield measurements of stellar radii to a\nprecision as good as 1 km, even better than the break frequency. Such a radius measurement\nconstrains to order 10% the pressure around twice nuclear density, a number unattainable\nin terrestrial laboratories which is correlated with properties such as the incompressibility\nand isospin asymmetry energy of nuclear matter.\nGW and EM observations of mergers are important to each other as described in the\ntransient white paper [13]: The availability of EM triggers localized in time and sky position\nincreases the sensitivity of GW searches, and comparison of GW and EM observations can\nconstrain properties of the merger and gamma-ray burst (if any). EM observations are important to GW mergers in another respect: While there are several observed NS/NS systems\non which to empirically base merger rates, and eventually make population statements by\ncomparing to observed GW merger rates, the BH/NS event rates are estimated purely based\non theoretical population synthesis codes which contain many poorly known factors. If a\npulsar survey, performed for instance by the Square Kilometer Array [3], reveals any BH/NS\nbinaries it would be of great relevance to GW merger observations.\nIn order to get the most science out of the observations it is also crucial to support\na program of numerical simulations of increasing complexity and realism. Details of the\nneutron star matter such as equation of state, viscosity and other transport coefficients,\nphoton and neutrino luminosities are modeled at present very simply; yet they may have\nimportant signatures in the GW emission and certainly are crucial to the EM emission. It\nis also important to continue work on analytical and semi-analytical perturbation theory, as\nwitnessed by the recent analytical prediction of an important tidal effect [16] which preceded\nnumerical investigations [24] due to the computational cost of lengthy simulations. Advances\nin population simulation [18] are also important to extract astrophysical information from\nGW event rates.\n\nStarquakes\nLIGO has already placed upper limits on GW bursts associated with flares of highly\nmagnetized neutron stars or magnetars [5, 9], in some cases comparable to the 1045 erg\nassociated with the largest giant flare; and Advanced LIGO will be sensitive to GW energies\nmore than two orders of magnitude lower. The dominant model of the flares [26] associates\nthem with starquakes due to sudden rearrangements of the neutron star's intense magnetic\nfield, quakes which would undoubtedly excite the star's quasinormal modes and thus emit\nGWs. Indeed the quasiperiodic oscillations seen in the x-ray tails of giant flares may be\nmodes of the crust, influenced by the magnetic field [17]. The GW upper limits are already\ninteresting in the sense that they are just entering the range predicted by the most extreme\ntheoretical models. However, it is not clear what range of GW energies would be associated\n2\n\n\fwith other models of the flare, because there has been relatively little theoretical work on\nthe subject. Thus there is a need for modeling to extract more meaning from current GW\nobservations, let alone those in the next decade.\nGW searches so far have focused on frequencies tied to the quasiperiodic oscillations seen\nin x-rays after the flares, on ringdowns of the fundamental or f -modes which are probably\nthe most efficient GW emitters, and opportunistic searches for random bursts around 100 Hz\nwhere the detectors' noise is low. The frequency of a detected f -mode would strongly constrain the structure of the star-neutron stars would be easily distinguishable from quark\nstars, and the mean density can be measured to a percent [20]. The total energy radiated\nwould reveal the mechanical efficiency of the flare mechanism and have something to say\nabout how much of the action happens inside the neutron star as opposed to the magnetosphere surrounding it. The energy and rate at which energy is transferred to the f -mode\nfrom the initial excitation could also reveal something about how the Alfv\u00e9n continuum of\nmagnetic modes is coupled to the mechanical modes, and thus how the magnetic field is\ndistributed within the star; and any timing offsets between GW and EM events would also\nconstrain the possible couplings. Even more exciting would be a detection of a random\nburst not associated with a known mode or x-ray quasiperiodic oscillation: Such a signal\ncould be evidence of turmoil of the magnetic field interior to the star rather than in the\nmagnetosphere.\nThe story will be similar for searches for GW bursts associated with pulsar glitches. Although the glitch mechanism still remains a puzzle, it can be reasonably expected that the\ntransfer of angular momentum to the crust from the core, which is believed to be differentially rotating with respect to the crust, would excite quasinormal modes and thus GW\nemission. Extrapolating from [9]: With advanced ground-based interferometers tuned to\nkHz frequencies, modes excited by glitches of the nearby Vela pulsar might be observable;\nand future underground detectors would be sensitive to large glitches from pulsars within a\nfew kpc.\nFor both starquake scenarios as for mergers, EM astronomy plays a crucial role increasing\nthe GW search sensitivity by localizing the times and sky positions of the events. Burst\nsearches using non-matched filtering techniques also improve when provided with frequency\nwindows, such as determined by observations of quasiperiodic oscillations or predictions of\nquasinormal mode frequencies. Therefore in order to help GW observations it is important to\nsustain x-ray, gamma-ray, and radio timing and rapid response capabilities. And to extract\nphysical information on the interiors of neutron stars it is important to have more modeling\nof GW and EM emission mechanisms, and the phenomenology of how they relate to each\nother.\n\nContinuous Waves\nLong-lived continuous-wave GW signals may be the hardest to detect, and certainly they\nare the most computationally costly to search for; but with 109 \u20131010 cycles per year they\ncould ultimately yield the most precise information on neutron stars. Here the connections between GW and EM astronomy are particularly tight: Because all continuous-wave\nsearches except monitoring of known (EM) pulsars are severely computationally limited,\n3\n\n\felectromagnetic observations can greatly increase the sensitivities of GW searches. The difference between the best upper limits for all-sky and known-pulsar searches on the same\nset of LIGO data is nearly an order of magnitude in strain amplitude [6, 7] or a factor 100\ndifference in luminosity. The all-sky survey also used much more computing power to achieve\nits lesser sensitivity.\nAll-sky GW surveys can reveal entirely new neutron star populations. Of the 108 \u2013\n109 neutron stars formed in our galaxy over 1010 years, only 2000 have been identified\nelectromagnetically-the vast majority as pulsars-and only 20,000 could be identified as\npulsars even with the Square Kilometer Array [3]. This is because most neutron stars are\ntoo old to pulse and pulsar EM emission is relatively narrowly beamed, meaning that only a\nfraction of currently EM-active pulsars can be observed. But GW emission is beamed very\nlittle, and the emission mechanisms (which ultimately rely on some nonaxisymmetry of the\nmass or momentum distribution in the star) may not be limited in activity to the youth\nof the star or a possible \"recycled by accretion\" phase as they are for pulsars. The main\nselection effect is that continuous GW emission is detectable only for spin frequencies in the\nground-based detector band, about 1/5 of known pulsars for Advanced LIGO and Advanced\nVirgo. Although population studies of continuous wave sources are still in their infancy [19],\nLIGO searches are already coming within striking distance of the most extreme scenarios [4]\nand Advanced LIGO will have something to say about more likely scenarios.\nCoherent integration of a year of data can allow LIGO to localize a continuous wave\nsource's sky location to the sub-arcsecond level [14], facilitating followup observations to\nfind counterparts in x-rays, optical, and other electromagnetic wavebands. Gravitationalwave timing of newly detected spinning neutron stars will also aid followup searches for\nelectromagnetic pulsations by providing spin frequencies and frequency derivatives. An extended observation with Advanced LIGO can also, through sphericality of the wavefronts,\nobtain a distance measurement (independent of EM observation) to about 10% [25].\nA distance measurement (whether GW-based or EM-based from a known pulsar) allows\na determination of the neutron star's quadrupolar deformation or ellipticity, a quantity of\ngreat interest since it may shed light on whether the neutron star is indeed made of neutrons\nor contains quarks or other exotica. Very large ellipticities are sustainable in quark models\nbut not in normal nuclear matter, and thus detection of a large enough ellipticity would\nconfirm not only the existence but also the crystalline nature of quark matter [22].\nRapidly accreting neutron stars (whether pulsing or not) in low-mass x-ray binaries are\nalso very interesting targets for continuous GW searches because the accretion is known\nto be asymmetric due to the occasional observation of x-ray pulsations in some systems.\nThis asymmetry can lead to a GW-emitting mass asymmetry through several mechanisms\nincluding the temperature-dependent electron capture onto nuclei in the crust [12], magnetic funneling of accreted material [21], and sustained instability of rotational \"r-mode\"\noscillations in the fluid below the crust [11] (which are likely to have a briefer episode of\ncontinuous GW emission in young neutron stars [23]). The observed lack of extremely high\nspin frequencies in the most rapidly accreting neutron stars also strongly suggests that their\naccretion torques are balanced by GW emission torque [12]. In the simplest version of this\ntorque balance scenario, Sco X-1 would be detectable by advanced interferometers, while\nmany systems would be detectable with future underground instruments; and if the GW\nemission (like the x-ray emission) also goes through active and quiescent phases, many sys4\n\n\ftems would be detectable by advanced interferometers if they go through a GW-active phase\nin the next decade [30]. Determination of the neutron star spin period in Sco X-1 or other\nsystems where it is completely unknown increases the sensitivity of a GW search by a factor\nof a few in strain amplitude, or an order of magnitude in luminosity. Detection of a signal\nfrom an accreting neutron star would confirm the hypothesis that the observed spins of older\nneutron stars are due to GW/accretion torque balance, and would constrain the mechanics\nof accretion as well.\nParticularly interesting is the case when GW and EM observations are made simultaneously, whether in pulsars or in the many accreting neutron stars where the spin frequency is\nonly roughly known (for instance through x-ray burst oscillations): The ratio of gravitationalwave frequency to spin frequency immediately identifies the emission mechanism, whether\na static deformation (ellipticity) of the rotating star or an oscillating r-mode. In the latter\ncase, the frequency ratio has some dependence on the neutron star structure [8] and thus,\nonce observed, can be used to measure the equation of state of dense matter. Due to a complicated interplay of factors involving the microphysics of the matter deep inside the star\nand possibly its effect on fluid and superfluid dynamics, detection of a long-lasting r-mode\nsignal from an accreting neutron star (at any frequency) is a strong indicator for the presence of some type of strange matter (quarks, mesons, or hyperons) in the core (e.g. [29, 10]).\nIf precise EM timing is available on long timescales, even more is possible: A comparison\nbetween GW and EM timing can constrain the coupling between the solid GW-emitting\ncomponent of the star and whatever component of the star and magnetosphere is emitting\nEM [8]; and this comparison across a glitch may shed light on the glitch mechanism. Future\nunderground interferometers might also be able to observe (for the first few days after a\nglitch) a continuous GW signal associated with the fluid interior's response to the abrupt\nrelative motion of the crust; and this signal would carry information on the superfluidity\nand transport coefficients of the matter in the interior [28].\nWhat is needed to realize this potential? Since searches for GW from known pulsars rely\non coherent phase models lasting of order a year, it is crucial to have regularly updated EM\npulsar timing data synchronous with LIGO and Virgo data runs. With most pulsars pulsing\nin radio, it is important to maintain healthy radio observatories and monitor those pulsars\nwith high spindowns which leave room for strong GW emission-such as PSRs J1952+3252\nand J1913+1011, which have not been observed for some time. Also one of the most rapidly\nspinning down and frequently glitching pulsars, J0537-6910, can only be timed at the moment with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite. The extreme glitchiness of this pulsar\nindicates a substantial and quickly changing solid component, which also indicates likely\nstrong gravitational-wave emission. However it also means that without regular timing a\nLIGO search for J0537 would quickly become intractable, as the number of possible timings\nto be used in the analysis would grow out of control. Since RXTE is scheduled to go down\nsoon, it is important to get a comparable mission back up quickly. It is also helpful to GW\nobservations to discover as many new pulsars as possible (in radio, x-rays, or any band),\nand to discover pulsations in stars where they have not yet been observed. Further hunts for\nyoung neutron stars and massive star forming regions will also help GW searches by producing more targets for point or small-area searches, which can be more sensitive than all-sky\nsearches [31]. Finally, it is crucial to encourage work on the theory of emission mechanisms\nand all the complicated physics of neutron stars, as this is needed to turn the combined EM\n5\n\n\fand GW data streams into statements about the properties of matter in states unreachable\nin terrestrial laboratories.\n\nReferences\n[1] http://www.ligo.org/.\n[2] http://www.virgo.infin.it/.\n[3] http://www.skatelescope.org/.\n[4] B.
