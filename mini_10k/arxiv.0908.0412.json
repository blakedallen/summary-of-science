An analysis of these\nDOS-maps found a local breaking of the square symmetry\nof the underlying lattice to form a checkerboard pattern.\nThe presence of this checkerboard pattern in these two\ndifferent underdoped cuprates has been interpreted as evidence for the presence of an intrinsic bond-centered electronic glass with unidirectional domains as a key characteristic of the pseudogap phase in underdoped cuprates.2\nA number of different interpretations of this pattern have\nalso been suggested in the literature.3,4,5,6,7,8,9 In our\nstudy we reexamine possible origins for this pattern in\nlight of very recent STM experiments.10\nThe new STM data taken in the superconducting state\nat low temperatures, show that the checkerboard pattern\nappears most prominently at voltages where the tunneling processes are predominantly into antinodal regions\nin k-space. At lower voltages the spatial pattern of the\nDOS-maps is quite different. The low energy pattern\nin the superconducting state was successfully analyzed\nas arising from interference generated by the scattering\nof propagating Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the presence\nof weak disorder.11 Kohsaka et al. found that a rapid\nchange in the spatial pattern in the DOS-maps occurred\nat the tunneling voltage corresponding to the energy of\nnodal centered arcs of Bogoliubov quasiparticles at their\nendpoints on the diamond formed by the lines in k-space\nconnecting the antinodal points.10 Thus the checkerboard\npattern which appears at higher voltages is formed by the\ntunneling of electrons and holes into pseudogap state located in the antinodal regions of k-space. The key question to be answered is the origin and interpretation of\nthis checkerboard pattern.\n\nThe checkerboard pattern is characterized by a local\nsymmetry breaking which reduces the square C4 symmetry of the Cu-O-Cu bonds in a (CuO)4 square plaquette\nto C2 symmetry leading to a unidirectional pattern of\ndomains with a glassy short range order on the length\nscale of 4a (a: lattice parameter). This short range order with local symmetry breaking has led to proposals\nthat a static spin-charge stripe glass coexists with the\nsuperconductivity.5,6,8,9 Another set of proposals3,4,7 are\nbased on the existence of static fluctuations in an order parameter which breaks both translational and C4\nsymmetry leading to strong scattering of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles consistent with the observations. At\nthis point we should comment on the difficulties associated with an explanation based on an intrinsic symmetry\nbreaking. While it is true that the STM experiments were\nperformed on the highly disordered cuprates, BSCCO\nand Ca2\u2212x Nax CuO2 Cl2 , because of their good surfaces.\nNot all underdoped cuprates are disordered, for example, the two members of the YBCO family, YBa2 Cu4 O8\nand YBa2 Cu3 O6.5 -ortho-II, are well ordered and intrinsically strongly underdoped with hole concentrations estimated to be x = 0.14 and 0.1 respectively. Indeed\nsamples of these cuprates are of sufficient quality to allow the observation of quantum oscillations at high fields\nand low temperatures.12 Zero field experiments on these\nwell ordered samples show no evidence of static broken\ntranslational symmetry in nuclear magnetic resonance\n(YBa2 Cu4 O8 )13 or neutron scattering (YBa2 Cu3 O6.5 ortho-II ) experiments.14 This lead us to conclude that\nthe translational symmetry breaking observed by STM\nin the BSCCO and Ca2\u2212x Nax CuO2 Cl2 samples results\nfrom the strong disorder associated with random doping\na short range spin liquid in these cuprates.\nIn this paper we propose that the checkerboard pattern\nobserved by STM is caused by the local disorder in the\nCuO2 planes. Our explanation goes back to the observation by Chen, Rice and Zhang (CRZ)15 that when the\nSTM tip is centered above the planar O-sites, it couples\n\n\f2\nto two tunneling paths through apical Cl ions above the\nneighboring Cu-sites and as a consequence interference\nbetween these paths plays an important role. This interference leads to a different tunneling matrix elements\nfor electrons into hole states which are bonding (antibonding) upon reflection about the central O-site of the\nCu-O-Cu bond.15 CRZ considered the dilute limit and\nexamined the localized states of a single hole bound to a\nNa+ -acceptor in a Ca2\u2212x Nax CuO2 Cl2 sample. The Na+ acceptor sits above the center of a (CuO)4 square plaquette. They found a doubly degenerate acceptor bound\nstate which in the presence of a local quadrupole electric\nfield splits into two states, each with only C2 bonding\nsymmetry. However this explanation of the local symmetry reduction from C4 to C2 symmetry is not compatible\nwith the recent STM data, which shows that the checkerboard pattern is formed by the tunneling of electrons and\nholes into pseudogap states located in the antinodal regions of k-space. The lowest energy for a single hole is\nat the nodal regions of k-space so that single hole acceptor bound states are made up from combinations of\nhole states near to the nodal not antinodal regions of\nk-space. Nonetheless their main conclusion that interference of tunneling paths occurs when the STM tip is\nabove an O-site, remains valid.\nIn light of this new STM data10 we concentrate our attention on the role of the antinodal regions of k-space as\norigins of the checkerboard pattern. There are two such\nregions, one near (\u03c0,0) and the other near (0,\u03c0). The\nbonding-antibonding pattern on the Cu-O-Cu bonds differs between the two antinodal regions. For quasiparticle\nnear the (0,\u03c0) antinodal region the Bloch phase factor is\nbonding on Cu-O-Cu in the x-direction and anti-bonding\nin the y-direction, as shown in Fig.1(b). This pattern\nis reversed for the case of the (\u03c0,0) antinodal region.\nThus when the STM tip lies above the planar O-sites\nin a (CuO)4 square plaquette the stronger signal comes\nfrom the antinodal region with a bonding phase factor\nand a local difference in the tunneling DOS between the\ntwo antinodal regions will cause a breaking of the C4 to\nC2 symmetry. This symmetry breaking occurs only when\nthe STM tip lies above the O-sites in a (CuO)4 square\nplaquette but not when the tip is above Cu-sites. Typical\ncheckerboard patterns display strong modulation above\nthe planar O-sites but much weaker modulation is observed at the Cu sites. This strongly suggests that we\nshould concentrate on possible mechanisms that locally\ndifferentiate the two antinodal regions since it is this difference which will show up at the planar O-sites.\nIn their recent paper, Kohsaka et al. discussed the\nconditions that enhance the checkerboard pattern in the\ntunneling maps. They find that the pattern emerges most\nclearly in Z-maps which plot the ratio of differential conductances g(r, V ), at opposite bias, i.e.\nZ(r, E = eV ) = g(r, +V )/g(r, \u2212V )\n\n(1)\n\nFurther the checkerboard pattern is most pronounced\nwhen the voltage V is adjusted locally to the local pseu-\n\nSTM\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nCu\n\n+\nCu\n\n-\n\nOy\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n- Ox -\n\n-\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Top panel: schematic demonstration\nof the interference of the possible two tunneling paths from\nSTM tip to the Cu-O-Cu hybrid state when the tip is at the\nmidway between two Cl atoms.

This value varies strongly across the field\nof view in the STM measurements. This is typically\n40a \u00d7 40a and the typical length scale of the variation\nin the local value of the pseudogap is roughly 4a, similar\nto the length scale of coherent checkerboard patterns.\n\nIn this paper we examine possible sources of local symmetry breaking from C4 to C2 symmetry in the STM\npatterns in the presence of strong local disorder, combining the CRZ theory for STM tunneling with the Yang,\nRice and Zhang (YRZ)16 phenomenological form for the\nsingle electron propagator in the underdoped pseudogap\nphase.\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nYRZ-PHENOMENOLOGICAL SINGLE\nPARTICLE PROPAGATOR\n\nYRZ based their propagator on a generalization of the\nform of the propagator for a lightly doped array of 2leg Hubbard ladders derived by Konik et al.17 . They\nintroduced a self-energy, \u03a3R (k, \u03c9, x), which diverges at\n\u03c9 = 0 on a surface spanned by elastic particle-particle\numklapp scattering analogous to the behavior of the ladder model. In the 2D square lattice this umklapp surface is a diamond connecting antinodal points on the\nBrillouin zone boundary. Note this umklapp surface appears as the energy gap surface also in the case of wider\nHubbard ladders with more than 2 legs18 . YRZ took\nover the form of d-wave RVB gap function \u2206R (k, x) =\n\u22060 (x)(cos kx \u2212 cos ky ) from the renormalized mean field\ntheory of Zhang et al.19 Using their Gutzwiller renormalization factor gt (x) for longer range hopping, YRZ proposed a form for the coherent part of the single particle\npropagator GP (k, \u03c9, x) in the pseudogap state,\ngt (x)\nGP (k, \u03c9, x) =\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u000f(k) \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03a3R (k, \u03c9, x)\nX Zi\nk\n= gt (x)\n\u03c9\n\u2212\nEki\ni\n\u03a3R (k, \u03c9, x) =\n\n\u22062R (k, x)\n\u03c9 + \u000f0 (k)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u000f0 (k) only includes the NN renormalized hopping\ncontribution, meanwhile \u000f(k) includes both the NN and\nlonger range renormalized hopping contributions.\nThe YRZ propagator fits well the quasiparticle dispersion Eki and their weight Zki seen in angle resolved\nphotoemission (ARPES) experiments on the pseudogap\nphase.16,20 It has aslo been used successfully to interpret a number of other experiments on the cuprate superconductor, i.e. Raman scattering21 , optical properties22 ,\nand specific heat23 . Recently Yang et al.20 showed that it\nalso accounts well for the particle-hole asymmetry in the\nquasiparticle properties opening up along the Fermi arcs\nreported by Yang et al. in the normal pseudogap phase.24\nVery recently25 the temperature and doping dependence\nof superconducting penetration depth was also shown to\nfit well to this scheme. In the antinodal regions of k-space\nthe energy gap is largest with a magnitude \u2206R (kA , x),\nwhere kA is an antinodal wavevector: kA,x = (\u03c0, 0) and\nkA,y = (0, \u03c0). The value of \u22060 (x) is taken from the\nrenormalized mean field theory of Zhang et al. for the\nRVB state.19 It is a strong function of the hole density,\nx, dropping linearly with increasing x from \u22060 at x = 0\nto 0 at a critical hole concentration x = xc (\u223c 0.2).\nIII. RANDOM ELECTRIC FIELD IN A\nTHOMAS-FERMI APPROXIMATION\n\nIn the cuprates BSCCO and Ca2\u2212x Nax CuO2 Cl2 which\nhave been studied in the STM experiments, the holes are\n\nintroduced by randomly distributed acceptors situated\nabove and below the CuO2 -planes. The random electric\nfield \u03c6(r) associated with the acceptors generates a random component in the local hole density. The case of\na slowly varying potential can be treated in a ThomasFermi approximation. The hole chemical potential \u03bch is\na constant in space. In the YRZ propagator the hole\npocket is determined by the quasiparticle energy contour\nat the chemical potential \u03bch which lies above the minimum hole energy Ehb located at the midway between the\nnode and (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) points in hole notation as shown in\nthe upper panel of Fig. 2. The hole density of states\n(DOS) rises almost linearly with increasing hole energy\nin the YRZ ansatz, in agreement with recent angle integrated photoemission data.26 The spatial varying hole\nFermi energy Eh (r) relative to the bottom of the hole\nband in a simple Thomas-Fermi ansatz is given by\nEh (r) = \u03bch \u2212 \u03c6(r)\n\n(3)\n\nleading to a spatial variation in the hole density x(r), as\nshown in the lower panel of Fig. 2. This has two effects,\nfirst, a breathing of the area enclosed by the hole pockets\nand therefore the Fermi arcs observed by ARPES and\nby quasiparticle interference in STM. Second, it introduces a local variation in the RVB gap \u2206R (kA , x) which\nas remarked above, is a strong function of the hole density. The strong spatial variation in the RVB gap can\nbe measured by the energy of the maximum in the DOS\nrelative to the constant chemical potential. That has\nbeen reported in several STM studies.2,10,27 A breathing\nof the Fermi arc determined by quasiparticle interference\nin STM spectra, was recently reported by Wise et al.27\nIV.\nINTERFERENCE IN TUNNELING\nSPECTRA WITH THE STM TIP ABOVE O-SITES\n\nThe detailed STM maps showing the checkerboard patterns were taken on two compounds, Dy-doped BSCCO\nand Ca2\u2212x Nax CuO2 Cl2 . In BSCCO samples the outmost surface layer is a BiO plane with the Bi-ions located\ndirectly above the Cu-sites in the CuO2 -plane. Assuming the STM tips couple predominantly to the empty\n6s/6p Bi-orbitals, the analysis presented below will apply also to BSCCO. We shall restrict ourselves to the\nformer which has a simpler structure. At this point it\nis useful to recap the CRZ analysis, which discussed the\nrole interference between neighboring tunneling paths in\nthe STM maps.

To proceed further it is useful to examine the nature of the anisotropy observed in the tunneling spectra\nmore closely.\nMEASURED ANISOTROPIC STM\nTUNNELING SPECTRA.\n\nKohsaka et al.10 found that the checkerboard pattern\nemerges most clearly in Z-maps which plot the ratio of\ndifferential conductances g(r, V ), at opposite bias, when\nthe voltage V is chosen to be at the local value of the\nantinodal energy gap. In an earlier publication by the\nsame group, individual spectra g(r, V ), where plotted\nfor a series of tip positions placed above O-sites in a\nsmall area with a pronounced checkerboard modulation.2\nThis is illustrated in the checkerboard modulation which\nshows up clearly in the R-map in Fig.3 which is reproduced from their Fig.4B.2 The R-ratio measures the ratio\nof the integrated currents I(r, V ), at positive and negative voltages\n(10)\n\nThe map reproduced in Fig. 3 shows the R-pattern taken\nat an energy E = 150 meV, with clear modulations when\nthe tip is above the O-sites with a local C2 symmetry\nbut almost no modulations are observed over the Cusites (denoted by black crosses).

We have extracted the individual tunneling spectra\ng(r, V ) above the O-sites in this typical small area with\na pronounced checkerboard pattern in the R-map (shown\nin Fig. 5B of Ref[2] ). All spectra on these underdoped\nsamples show a substantial asymmetry between negative\nand positive voltages30,31 . The negative voltage spectra, which correspond to electron extraction or hole injection, show little structure and has the larger differential conductances. Since a hole can easily exchange positions with a neighboring occupied site, while an electron\ncan only hop onto the unoccupied neighboring sites, the\ntunneling processes that accompany an injected hole are\nmuch stronger than those for an electron, as shown by\nAnderson and Ong30 and by Randeria et al. 31 . Within\nthe renormalized mean field theory (RMFT) of Zhang et\nal.19 , the asymmetry is largely due to the incoherent tunneling process in the hole injection. In the approach we\nuse here based on the YRZ normal state propagator, only\ncoherent parts of the tunneling processes are included,\nand the particle-hole asymmetry appears at finite voltages which involves tunneling into quasi-particle states\naway from the chemical potential. The positive voltage\nspectra show a clear peak around an energy of order 100\nmeV. Such a peak appears in the density of states calculated for the YRZ propagator by Yang et al.16 The YRZ\npropagator is an ansatz to describe coherent quasiparticles moving in a RVB background and so should agree\nbetter for positive voltage due to the weaker contribution\nof inelastic processes which accompany electron injection.\nIn the subsequent discussion we will focus on the positive\nvoltage spectra and normalize the spectra to be the same\nin the negative voltage region. In Fig. 4 we show a series\nof the differential conductances with the tip above O-sites\n\n\f5\n\n(a): tx/y /t = 1.0\n\n4\n\nOx/y\n\n3\n2\n1\n\nCu\n\nN(E) (arb. units)\n\nN(E) (arb. units)\n\n6\n\n-150-100-50 0 50 100 150\nE (meV)\n10\n(c): tx/y /t = 1.0\n8\n6\n\nOx/y\n\n4\n2\n\nCu\n0\n-150-100-50 0 50 100 150\nE (meV)\n\n4\n3\n\n(b): tx/y /t = 1.0 +/- 0.1\nOy O\nx\n\n2\n1\n\nCu\n\n0\n\nN(E) (arb. units)\n\nN(E) (arb. units)\n\n0\n\n5\n\n-150-100-50 0 50 100 150\nE (meV)\n10\n(d): tx/y /t = 1.0 +/- 0.1\n8\n6 Oy\n4\n\nOx\nCu\n0\n-150-100-50 0 50 100 150\nE (meV)\n2\n\nsuming that the intrinsic asymmetry in the self energy\nin the YRZ propagator is small, the change of NN hopping integrals tx/y leads to a relative displacement of the\nreference energy for the RVB splitting at kA,x and kA,y .\nThis in turn leads to a shift in the position of the energy\ngaps \u2206R (kA , x), relative to the constant chemical potential. This is apparent in Fig. 5 which shows the predicted\nanisotropy arising from a uniform hopping asymmetry.\nThe density of states, N (E), observed by putting the\nSTM tip above Ox/y and Cu sites takes the following\nform from Eq.(7)\nN Ox/y (E) \u223c\n\nX\ni,k\n\nN\n\nCu\n\n(E) \u223c\n\nX\n\nZki cos2\n\nkx/y\n(cos kx \u2212 cos ky )2 \u03b4(Eki \u2212 E)\n2\n\nZki (cos kx \u2212 cos ky )2 \u03b4(Eki \u2212 E)\n\n(11)\n\ni,k\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) The density of states on Cu and two\nkinds oxygen sites [Ox/y ] from YRZ propagator Eq.11 without\n(panels a and b) and with (panels c and d) the interference\nfactor (cos kx \u2212 cos ky )2 .

Very\nsmall superconducting gaps are added to each band in pseudogap state, which does not change the RVB gap behavior (the\ntwo pronounced peaks at high energy \u223c 100meV) on Ox/y .2\n\nin the x/y oriented Cu-O-Cu bonds. The difference from\nthe lower C2 -symmetry is clearly visible.\n\nVI. POSSIBLE SOURCES OF THE\nANISOTROPY IN THE TUNNELING SPECTRA.\n\nWe now discuss a number of physical effects which\ncould cause an anisotropy in the tunneling spectra.\n\nA.\n\nIntrinsic C2 asymmetry due to nematic or\nPomeranchuk order\n\nAn asymmetry between the two antinodal regions near\nkA,x = (\u03c0, 0) and kA,y = (0, \u03c0) suggests that an intrinsic instability which breaks the C4 -symmetry may\nbe present in these samples. The possibility of such an\ninstability has been discussed extensively in the literature. One set of these proposals focuses on a quantum\nelectronic liquid crystal with nematic order.32,33,34,35 A\nsecond on a Pomeranchuk instability which splits the\ntwo Van Hove singularities.36,37 Recent neutron scattering measurements of the low frequency spin fluctuations\nin YBCO samples have been interpreted as evidence for\nsuch intrinsic instabilities.38 In the presence of intrinsic\nasymmetry the NN hopping matrix elements in the xand y- directions tx and ty will be slightly different. As-\n\nwhere (cos kx \u2212 cos ky )2 is the interference factor due to\nthe hybridization with the hole states centered on the 4\nNN Cu-sites as discussed earlier.\nIn a clean well ordered sample with intrinsic C2 asymmetry order large domains should occur but in the\nhighly disordered Ca2\u2212x Nax CuO2 Cl2 samples there is a\nstrong spatially varying electric field. The linear coupling between the orientation of the domains and the\nlocal quadrupole component of a random electric field\nacts as a random orienting field on the order. Since the\nsymmetry of the order is Ising like, the random orienting field will act similarly to a random field in an Ising\nmodel. It is well known that the ground state of this\nIsing model consists of a random array of domains, consistent with the orientational domains observed in the\ncheckerboard patterns. A word of caution, however, is in\norder. The local anisotropy in the STM spectra does not\nseem to be consistent with that predicted for this type\nlocal asymmetry order. The spectra in Fig. 4 show a C2\n-modulation pattern arising from an overall reduction in\nthe positive voltage spectra, rather than a shift in the\nmaxima that would signal the presence of this intrinsic\nC2 asymmetry in Fig.5.\nThe theoretical DOS for the STM tip located above\nCu- and O-sites shown in Fig.5 display considerably\nsharper structure in both cases, with and without the\nweighting factor (cos kx \u2212 cos ky )2 , than is evident in\nthe experimental conductances in Fig.4. The theoretical DOS contain two prominent features. One is the\napproximately linear drop from negative to positive voltages leading to the minimum at ' 60meV. Interestingly\nthis linear feature has been reported in integrated photoemission studies on BSSCO samples by Hashimoto et\nal.,26 as discussed recently by Yang et al.20 . In the STM\nspectra there are signs of a minimum at positive voltages\nin the spectral 2h, 2f in Fig.4, but at a smaller voltage and\nfaint signs in the other spectra. The second feature is the\nvery sharp peak at \u223c 100meV in the theoretical spectra\nand the much broader peaks at around the same energy\nin the STM spectra. For both discrepancies a possible\nremedy could be the much stronger disorder broadening\n\n\f7\nin the local probe in the STM spectra as compared to\nspatially averaged spectra observed in photoemission.\n\nB.\n\nRandom electric fields\n\nThe random distribution of Na+ -acceptors in\nCa2\u2212x Nax CuO2 Cl2 samples generates a random electric\nfield. The local quadrupole component of this field\nacting on a (CuO)4 plaquette will couple differently to\nthe states at kA,x and kA,y . The former is anti-bonding\non the Cu-O-Cu bonds along the x-axis and bonding\non the Cu-O-Cu bonds along the y-axis while the latter\nhas the opposite bonding pattern. These patterns cause\nopposite quadrupole charge distributions in the two\nstates leading to a potential splitting of the antinodal\nstates in the presence of an external electric quadrupole\nfield. This potential splitting will generate STM spectra\nsimilar to those we found for hopping asymmetry and so\nit also differs from the anisotropy displayed in Fig. 4\n\nC.\n\nVariations in the quasiparticle weight and in\nthe localization length\n\nThe tunneling DOS into quasiparticle states is\nweighted by the quasiparticle weight in the single particle propagator. In the YRZ ansatz this weight is taken\nfrom the RMFT calculations of Zhang et al.19 and is simply proportional to the hole density, x. However the fact\nthat little change in the energy gaps \u2206R (kA,x , x), is evident in the spectra shown in Fig. 4 argues against such\nan explanation. Also the spatial variation in the hole\ndensity is longer ranged than the distance between Osites on a (CuO)4 . Another possibility is that there is\nsubstantial anisotropy in the disorder scattering in kspace which causes a local anisotropy in the localization lengths. An anisotropic energy shift and localization length could result, if the potential scattering from\nthe disorder is mainly between opposite antinodal points\nrather than between \u00b1kA,x and \u00b1kA,y . An anisotropic\nenergy shift, for example, could remove weight from the\nenergy range ( 200meV) covered in the STM experiments.\nThe somewhat longer range of the disorder potential is\nconsistent with this suggestion.

The Fourier transforms of the checkerboard maps show peaks arising from short range order\nin the form of 4a wide unidirectional electronic domains.\nThe analysis presented here does not directly address the\npresence of short range order on a length scale > a. Several authors have suggested that the wave vector of this\nshort range order is approximately equal to the wave vector connecting parallel pieces of the bare band structure\nFermi surface near the saddle points11 and also the wave\nvector connecting the turning points of the quasiparticle\ncontours in the normal state YRZ propagators.39 The\nlength scale of the domains at \u223c 4a is roughly the same\nas the disorder potential length scale but the interpretation of the short range order in the checkerboard patterns\nremains to be an open issue.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we have examined several possible origins for the local checkerboard pattern in the tunneling\nDOS measured over Ox/y -sites. The presence of interference between two tunneling paths centered above the\nneighboring Cu-sites leads to an anisotropic weighting\nof the two antinodal regions in k-space. Thus the local C2 pattern of the checkerboard can reflect an asymmetry between the two antinodal k-space regions. An\nasymmetric hopping (tx , ty ) could arise from an intrinsic\ninstability e.g. towards nematic or Pomeranchuk order.\nThis would split the energies of the pseudogaps at \u00b1kA,x\nand \u00b1kA,y . However, an examination of the measured\nanisotropy in the differential conductance points rather\ntowards an asymmetry in the average magnitude of the\nconductance, which possibly could result from a difference in the localization lengths at the two antinodal saddle points in the quasiparticle dispersion.\nWe are very grateful to J.C.S.
