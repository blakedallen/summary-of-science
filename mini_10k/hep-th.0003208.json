In particular, Matrix Theory [1]\nand the IIB matrix model [2], which are candidates for a nonperturbative definition of Mtheory and type IIB superstring theory, respectively, have attracted considerable interest\n(for reviews, see Refs. [5, 6]). The proposed formulations take the form of large N reduced\nmodels [7], which can be obtained by dimensional reduction of large N gauge theories; a\nreduction to one dimension for M-theory, and to zero dimension (one point) for type IIB\nsuperstring theory. These proposals are supported by some evidences such as the similarity of the Hamiltonian (or the action) to that of membranes or strings, the appearance of\nsoliton-type objects known as D-branes with consistent interactions, and the consistency\nwith string dualities upon compactification. For the IIB matrix model, even an attempt to\nestablish a direct connection to perturbative string theory has been made by deriving the\nlight-cone string field Hamiltonian from loop equations of the model [8]. This attempt was\nindeed successful, albeit with the aid of symmetry and power-counting arguments. Further\nvariants of that model have been proposed in Refs. [9].\nAs another approach to analyze these proposals we can investigate the dynamical properties of large N reduced models of this kind, and verify if they really have the potential to\ndescribe nonperturbative string theory. In Ref. [10] a two-dimensional reduced model with\nunitary matrices has been studied in this context. There, a large N limit, which differs from\nthe planar limit (or 't Hooft limit), has been discovered numerically 1 . A Hermitian matrix\nmodel obtained by simply omitting the fermions in the IIB matrix model, and its generalizations to arbitrary dimensions larger than two, have been studied in Refs. [12, 13]. In Ref.\n[13], Monte Carlo simulations up to N = 256 have been reported and analytical methods\nsuch as perturbation theory, Schwinger-Dyson equations and 1/D expansions have been applied, providing a comprehensive understanding of the large N dynamics of that model. A\nnew type of Monte Carlo technique was used to extract the value of the partition function\n[14, 12]. This technique has been further applied to extract the asymptotic behavior of the\neigenvalue distribution for large eigenvalues [15, 16].\nIn the present paper, we make a first attempt to extract the large N dynamics of a supersymmetric large N reduced model obtained by dimensional reduction of 4D supersymmetric\n1\n\nThis non-planar large N limit has recently been re-interpreted as a continuum limit of non-commutative\ngauge theory [11].\n\n1\n\n\fYang-Mills theory. The model can be regarded as a 4D counterpart of the IIB matrix model.\nThe bosonic model is well understood [12, 13], but the inclusion of fermions makes the system\nfar more complicated. An attempt to study the model analytically maps it onto a soluble\nsystem [17], but the relevance to the original model is unclear due to a nontrivial change\nof variables in an analytic continuation. Here we take a direct approach, based on Monte\nCarlo simulations. Fermions are completely included by the use of the so-called Hybrid-R\nalgorithm [18], which is one of the standard methods in QCD simulations with dynamical\nquarks.\nOne of the features that makes the IIB matrix model most attractive as a nonperturbative\ndefinition of string theory is that space-time is dynamically generated as the eigenvalue\ndistribution of the bosonic matrices [2, 19, 20]. In Ref. [19] a low energy effective theory\nof the model is constructed, where the authors discuss some possible mechanisms that may\ninduce a collapse of the eigenvalue distribution to a four-dimensional manifold. We extract\nthe large N behavior of the space-time extent in our model and compare the result with\nthe prediction obtained by the low energy effective theory. Another dynamical issue to\nbe addressed in this context is the space-time uncertainty relation, which was proposed as\na principle for constructing nonperturbative string theory [21]. We extract the large N\nbehavior of the space-time uncertainty of our model and confirm that the model indeed\nsatisfies the proposed principle.\nAnother attractive feature of the IIB matrix model as a nonperturbative definition of\nstring theory is that its only parameter g is a simple scale parameter 2 . One has to tune\ng suitably as one sends N to infinity, so that the correlation functions have finite large N\nlimits. According to Ref. [8], Wilson loop operators can be interpreted as the string creation\nand annihilation operators, and it was found that g 2 N should be fixed in order to obtain the\nlight-cone string field Hamiltonian in the large N limit. It is a non-trivial test of the model\nto verify if the correlation functions of Wilson loops really have a universal large N scaling.\nWe address this issue in the present model and show that there is indeed a universal large\nN scaling at fixed g 2 N.\nWe also address yet another important dynamical issue in this model, namely the question of equivalence to ordinary super Yang-Mills theory in the sense of Eguchi and Kawai\n[7], which is exactly the way large N reduced models first appeared in history. The cru2\n\nThis means in particular that the string coupling constant, which is related to the vacuum expectation\nvalue of the dilaton field, is not a tunable parameter. We come back to this point in Section 4.3.\n\n2\n\n\fcial observation is that large N gauge theory does not depend on the volume (under some\nassumptions), which inspired Eguchi and Kawai to propose the zero-volume limit of large\nN gauge theory as a model equivalent to the gauge theories in an infinite volume [7]. One\nof the assumptions is that the (ZN )D symmetry of the model is not spontaneously broken,\nwhere D is the space-time dimension. However, in the purely bosonic case in D > 2, the\nsymmetry is spontaneously broken at weak coupling [22], thus preventing one from taking\na continuum limit. This led to modifications of the model [22, 23, 24, 25, 26] so that the\n(ZN )D symmetry is not spontaneously broken while keeping the equivalence valid. In the\nsupersymmetric case, the effective action which induces the spontaneous symmetry breaking\nof the (ZN )D symmetry is naively cancelled by the contributions of fermions. Indeed, in the\nscalar field case, it has been shown that the reduced model is equivalent to the field theory\nwithout such modifications [27]. We observe in the present supersymmetric model that the\nEguchi-Kawai equivalence indeed holds at least in a finite range of scale. What is rather\nremarkable is that actually this is true also for the bosonic case, which is contrary to what\nhas been expected.\nIn Section 2 we describe the model we are going to investigate. In Section 3 we study\nthe space-time structure of the model. In Section 4 we present our results for correlation\nfunctions of Wilson loop and Polyakov line operators, and we discuss the Eguchi-Kawai\nequivalence as well as the universal scaling behavior. Section 5 is devoted to a summary and\ndiscussion. In Appendix A we comment on the algorithm we used for the simulation. In\nAppendix B we present the corresponding results for the bosonic case for comparison.\n\n2\n\nThe model\n\nThe model we investigate is a supersymmetric matrix model obtained by dimensional reduction of 4D SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory.

All these symmetries are inherited from the super Yang-Mills theory before dimensional reduction. The model can be regarded as the four-dimensional counterpart\nof the IIB matrix model [2].\nIn contrast to unitary matrix models, where the integration domain for the partition\nfunction is compact, the first nontrivial question to be addressed in Hermitian matrix models\nin general, is whether the model is well-defined as it stands. The problem can be most clearly\nunderstood by decomposing the Hermitian matrices into eigenvalues and angular variables,\nwhere a potential danger of divergence exists in the integration over the eigenvalues, even\nat finite N. This issue has been addressed numerically for the supersymmetric case [14] at\nN = 3 as well as the bosonic case [12] up to N = 6. Exact results are available for N = 2\n[28]. There is also a perturbative argument which is valid when all the eigenvalues are well\nseparated from each other [13, 19]. This reasoning agrees with the conclusions obtained for\nsmall N [12, 14, 28]. In particular, supersymmetric models in D = 4, 6, 10 are expected to\nbe well-defined for arbitrary N. Our simulations confirm that this is indeed the case for\nD = 4.\n3\n\nWhen one defines the IIB matrix model nonperturbatively, a Wick rotation to Euclidean signature in\nneeded. This is also the case for the present model. Hence by Lorentz invariance we actually mean rotational\ninvariance.\n\n4\n\n\fSince the model is well-defined without any cutoff, the parameter g, which is the only\nparameter of the model, can be absorbed by rescaling the variables,\nA\u03bc = g 1/2 X\u03bc ,\n\n(2.6)\n\n\u03c8\u03b1 = g 3/4 \u03a8\u03b1 .\n\n(2.7)\n\nTherefore, g is a scale parameter rather than a coupling constant, i.e. the g dependence\nof physical quantities is completely determined on dimensional grounds. The parameter g\nshould be tuned appropriately as one sends N to infinity, so that each correlation function\nof Wilson loops has a finite large N limit. Whether such a limit really exists or not is one\nof the dynamical issues we address in this work.\nWe now discuss the Eguchi-Kawai equivalence [7], which is the equivalence between\nreduced models and the corresponding gauge theories in the large N limit. In its proof\nbased on the Schwinger-Dyson equation, one has to assume quantities of the type\nhtr(eik\u03bc A\u03bc )tr(e\u2212ik\u03bc A\u03bc )i\n\n(k\u03bc 6= 0)\n\n(2.8)\n\nto vanish. Assuming in addition large N factorization, the vanishing of (2.8) is equivalent\nto htr(eik\u03bc A\u03bc )i= 0, which is guaranteed if the eigenvalues of A\u03bc are uniformly distributed\n\non the whole real axis in the large N limit. The fact that the present model is well-defined\n\nwithout any cutoff implies that the eigenvalue distribution of A\u03bc is not uniform, but it has\na finite extent for finite N. Hence, the Eguchi-Kawai equivalence is quite nontrivial even in\nthe supersymmetric case. Here the situation is more subtle than in the case of the unitary\nmatrix model version of a large N reduced model [7]. There, the model has the (ZN )D\nsymmetry U\u03bc \u2192 e2\u03c0im\u03bc /N U\u03bc (m\u03bc = 0, 1, * * * , N \u2212 1), hence quantities like htr(U\u03bc )n i vanish,\n\nunless the symmetry is spontaneously broken.\n\nOne might be tempted to consider a model defined by the partition function (2.1) but\nwithout imposing the traceless condition on A\u03bc . We denote such a model as the U(N) model,\nto be distinguished from the original model, which we call the SU(N) model. The U(N)\nmodel has the U(1)4 symmetry\nA\u03bc \u2192 A\u03bc + \u03b1\u03bc 1N ,\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere \u03b1\u03bc is a real vector. Note, however, that the trace part of A\u03bc in the U(N) model simply\ndecouples because A\u03bc appears in the action only through commutators. The transformation\n(2.9) acts on the decoupled trace part and hence it cannot play any physical r\u00f4le. Indeed\n5\n\n\fthe quantity (2.8) calculated with the U(N) model or with the SU(N) model is exactly the\nsame. Thus, considering the U(N) model does not help.\nNext we comment on the method we use to study the model. Details can be found in\nAppendix A. The integration over fermionic variables can be done explicitly and the result\nis given by det M, M being a 2(N 2 \u2212 1) \u00d7 2(N 2 \u2212 1) complex matrix which depends on\nA\u03bc . Hence the system we want to simulate can be written in terms of bosonic variables as\nZ\nZ = dA e\u2212Sb det M .\n(2.10)\n\nA crucial point for the present work is that the determinant det M is actually real positive,\n\nas we prove in Appendix A. Due to this property, we can introduce a 2(N 2 \u2212 1) \u00d7 2(N 2 \u2212 1)\n\u221a\nHermitian positive matrix D = M\u2020 M, so that det M = det D, and the effective action of\n\nthe system takes the form\n\nSeff = Sb \u2212\n\n1\nln det D .\n2\n\n(2.11)\n\nWe apply the Hybrid R algorithm [18] to simulate this system. In the framework of this\nalgorithm, each update of a configuration is made by solving a Hamiltonian equation for a\nfixed \"time\" \u03c4 . The algorithm is plagued by a systematic error due to the discretization of \u03c4\nthat we used to solve the equation numerically. We performed simulations at three different\nvalues of the time step \u2206\u03c4 . Except in Fig. 2, we find that the results do not depend much\non \u2206\u03c4 (below a certain threshold), so we just present the results for the value \u2206\u03c4 = 0.002,\nwhich appears to be sufficiently small.\nWe also note that there is an exact result\nhtrF 2 i = \u2212htr(\n\nX\n\u03bc6=\u03bd\n\n[A\u03bc , A\u03bd ]2 )i = 6g 2 (N 2 \u2212 1),\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhich can be obtained by a scaling argument, similar to the one used for the bosonic case\n[13]. We used this exact result to check the code and the numerical accuracy.\n\n3\n\nThe space-time structure\n\nWe first study the space-time structure of the reduced model. In the IIB matrix model,\nthe eigenvalues of the bosonic matrices A\u03bc are interpreted as the space-time coordinates\n[2, 6, 19, 20]. However, since the matrices A\u03bc are not simultaneously diagonizable in general,\nthe space-time is not classical. In order to extract the space-time structure, we first define\n6\n\n\fthe space-time uncertainty \u2206 by\n\u22062 =\n\n1 X\n1\n{(UA\u03bc U \u2020 )ii }2 ,\ntr(A\u03bc2 ) \u2212 max\nU \u2208SU(N ) N\nN\ni\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhich is invariant under Lorentz transformation and SU(N) transformation (2.5) [13]. This\nformula has been derived in Ref. [13] based on analogy to quantum mechanics, regarding\nA\u03bc as an operator acting on a space of states. It has the natural property that \u22062 vanishes\nif and only if the matrices A\u03bc are diagonalizable simultaneously. For each configuration\nP\nA\u03bc generated by a Monte Carlo simulation, we maximize i {(UA\u03bc U \u2020 )ii }2 with respect to\nthe SU(N) matrix U. We denote the matrix which yields the maximum as Umax , and we\n\n\u2020\ndefine x\u03bci = (Umax A\u03bc Umax\n)ii as the space-time coordinates of N points (i = 1, * * * , N) in\n\nfour-dimensional space-time.\n\nNote that x\u03bci should be identified with the dynamical variables denoted by the same x\u03bci\nin Ref. [19]. There, the bosonic matrices A\u03bc and the fermionic matrices \u03c8\u03b1 are decomposed\ninto diagonal and off-diagonal elements as\n(A\u03bc )ij = x\u03bci \u03b4ij + a\u03bcij\n\n(a\u03bcii = 0),\n\n(\u03c8\u03b1 )ij = \u03be\u03b1i \u03b4ij + \u03c6\u03b1ij\n\n(\u03c6\u03b1ii = 0).\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe off-diagonal parts a\u03bcij and \u03c6\u03b1ij are integrated out using the \"Lorentz gauge\" in the oneloop approximation, which is valid when the points x\u03bci (i = 1, * * * , N) are well separated from\n\neach other. Thus one obtains the effective action for x\u03bci and \u03be\u03b1i , which can be considered as a\nlow-energy effective action of the supersymmetric large N reduced model. In order to get the\neffective action only for x\u03bci , one still has to integrate over \u03be\u03b1i , which cannot be done exactly\nfor D = 6 and D = 10 (IIB matrix model). In D = 4, however, the integration over \u03be\u03b1i can\nbe carried out exactly and the system of x\u03bci is described by a simple branched polymer with\n\nan attractive potential between the points connected by a bond. In D = 6 and D = 10,\nthe system of x\u03bci is expected to be described by some complicated branched-polymer like\nstructure. Thus, although the one-loop approximation might seem quite drastic, the low\nenergy effective theory of x\u03bci still has a nontrivial dynamics. In Ref. [19], some plausible\nmechanisms for the collapse of the x\u03bci distribution in IIB matrix model have been discussed.\nWhat we have described in the previous paragraph provides a way to extract the low-energy\neffective theory of x\u03bci from the full model without perturbative expansions. In particular, we\ncan check explicitly whether the one-loop approximation adopted in Ref. [19] really captures\nthe low energy dynamics of the supersymmetric large N reduced model.\n7\n\n\fWe first look at the distribution \u03c1(r) of the distances r, where the distance between\np\ntwo arbitrary points xi 6= xj is measured by (xi \u2212 xj )2 . In Fig. 1 we plot the results\n\nfor N = 16, 24, 32 and 48. We first note that the distribution at small r falls off rapidly\n\u221a\nbelow r/ g \u223c 1.5, independently of N. (This behavior is also seen in the bosonic case\nshown in Fig. 10.) This observation is in agreement with the argument in Ref. [19] that the\n\nultraviolet behavior of the space-time structure of the model is controlled by the SU(2) matrix\nmodel. There, this argument has been used to justify the introduction of a N-independent\nultraviolet cutoff in the low energy effective theory, which otherwise suffers from ultraviolet\ndivergence due to coinciding x\u03bci 's. Our observation confirms that the ultraviolet cutoff\nis indeed generated dynamically if one treats the full model nonperturbatively instead of\nmaking perturbative expansions around diagonal matrices.\n\n\u03c1( r )\n\nN = 48\n32\n24\n16\n\n0.014\n0.012\n0.01\n0.008\n0.006\n0.004\n0.002\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nr/ g\n\n\u221a\nFigure 1: The distribution of distances \u03c1(r), plotted against r/ g for N = 16, 24, 32 and\n48.\nIn both, the supersymmetric as well as the bosonic case, we observe that the distribution\nshifts towards larger r as one increases N. In order to quantify this behavior, we define the\nextent of space-time by\nRnew\n\n2\n=\nN(N \u2212 1)\n\n*\nXq\ni<j\n\n(xi \u2212 xj\n8\n\n)2\n\n+\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndr r\u03c1(r).\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fWe denote this quantity by Rnew in order to distinguish it from the definition of the extent\nq\nof the space-time R = h N1 tr(A\u03bc2 )i used in Ref. [13]. R, which roughly corresponds to\nqR\n\u221e\nh 0 dr r 2 \u03c1(r)i, is logarithmically divergent in the 4D supersymmetric case due to the\n\nasymptotic behavior \u03c1(r) \u223c r \u22123 at large r [15]. On the other hand, Rnew does not suffer\n\nfrom this divergence as eq. (3.3) shows. In Fig. 2 we plot the results for the space-time\np\nextent Rnew as well as those for the space-time uncertainty h\u22062 i for N = 16, 24, 32 and\n\n48. We repeat the same measurements for the bosonic model with N up to 256 and include\n\nthe results in Fig. 2 for comparison. We see that the effect of fermions enhances Rnew and\np\nsuppresses h\u22062 i considerably. However, the power of the large N behavior does not seem\nto be affected.\n\n)\n\nSY\nR new(SU\n\n10\n\nson)\nR new(bo\non)\n\u2206 (bos\n\n)\n\nSY\n\u2206 (SU\n1\n10\n\n100\n\nN\np\n\u221a\nFigure 2: Rnew / g and h\u22062 i/g, plotted against N. The results for the bosonic model\nare also included. The lines are fits to the power behavior \u221d N 1/4 , which is predicted\ntheoretically. (In the labels we use a short-hand notation.)\n\nLet us discuss the results for Rnew . In the bosonic case, the data can be nicely fitted to a\n\u221a\npower behavior with Rnew / g = 1.56(1)*N 1/4 . As expected, the observed large N behavior of\nRnew is the same as the one obtained for R in Ref. [13]. In the supersymmetric case, the large\nN behavior of Rnew can be predicted by the branched polymer picture based on the one-loop\napproximation [19]. Since the Hausdorff dimension of branched polymers is four, dH = 4,\nthe number of points N grows as the extent Rnew of the branched polymer, N \u223c (Rnew /l)dH .\n9\n\n\f\u221a\nHere l is the minimum length of the bond, which is of O( g) as we have already discussed.\n\u221a\nThus one obtains Rnew \u223c g N 1/4 . The data in Fig. 2 seem to be consistent with this\n\u221a\nprediction. Fitting the data to this power behavior, we obtain Rnew / g = 3.30(1) * N 1/4 .\nOne might be surprised that supersymmetry does not affect the power of the large N\n\nbehavior of the space-time extent Rnew . We recall, however, that in the bosonic case the\nexplanation is completely different - although the power is the same [13]. There the one-loop\nperturbative expansion around diagonal matrices yields a logarithmic attractive potential\nbetween all the pairs of eigenvalues. The one-loop effective potential is dominant as far as\n\u221a\nthe extent of the eigenvalue distribution is larger than g N 1/4 . One can therefore put an\n\u221a\nupper bound on the space-time extent R . g N 1/4 . What happens actually is that this\n\u221a\nupper bound is saturated. The behavior R \u223c g N 1/4 can also be shown to all orders in the\n1/D expansion [13].\n\nLet us turn to the results for the space-time uncertainty. Using the one-loop perturbative\nexpansion, h\u22062 i can be roughly estimated as\n\u001c\n\u001d\n1 X\ng2\ng2N\n1 X\nha\u03bcij a\u03bcji i =\n.\n\u223c\nh\u2206 i =\n2\nN ij\nN ij (xi \u2212 xj )2\nRnew\n2\n\nThe powers of Rnew and\n\n(3.4)\n\np\nh\u22062 i, as well as the coefficients we observe, are in qualitative\n\nagreement with this estimation. The bosonic case has been studied before in Ref. [13]. The\np\ndata in Fig. 2 can be nicely fitted to a power behavior with h\u22062 i/g = 0.907(3) * N 1/4 .\np\nThus, in the bosonic case we obtain h\u22062 i \u223c 0.58 Rnew [13], which indicates a signficant\ndeviation from the classical space-time picture. On the other hand, in the supersymmetric\np\np\ncase we obtain h\u22062 i/g = 0.730(2) * N 1/4 , hence our result amounts to h\u22062 i \u223c 0.22 Rnew ,\n\ncoming closer to the classical space-time picture.\n\n\u221a\nWe will see in the next section that the scale parameter g should be taken to be O(1/ N )\n\nin order to obtain a universal scaling behavior for the Wilson loop correlators. This means\nthat the space-time uncertainty in the physical scale remains finite, rather than vanishing, in\nthe large N limit. Therefore the present model satisfies the space-time uncertainty principle\nproposed for nonperturbative definitions of string theories [21].\n\n4\n\nWilson loop correlation functions\n\nIn the interpretation of a large N reduced model as a string theory, Wilson loop operators\ncorrespond to string creation operators [8]. Therefore, the existence of a non-trivial large\n10\n\n\fN limit of the Wilson loop correlators is an absolutely crucial issue. It has been addressed\nbefore in the 2D Eguchi-Kawai model, where non-trivial large N scaling has indeed been\nobserved [10].\nWe define the \"Wilson loop\" and the \"Polyakov line\" operators as\n1\ntr(eikX1 eikX2 e\u2212ikX1 e\u2212ikX2 ) ,\nN\n1\nP (k) =\ntr(eikX1 ) ,\nN\n\nW (k) =\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere X\u03bc are dimensionless matrices defined in eq. (2.6). For convenience we have chosen\nparticular components of X\u03bc in the above definitions, but the choice of the directions becomes\nirrelevant when taking the vacuum expectation value, due to Lorentz symmetry and parity\ninvariance. In the actual calculations we take an average over all possible choices of the\ncomponents in order to enhance the statistics.\nThe real parameter k represents the dimensionless \"momentum\" that characterizes the\nmomentum density distributed along the string. The physical (dimensionful) momentum\n\u221a\nvariable is given by kphys = k/ g. We have to tune g depending on N, so that the correlation\nfunctions of the above operators have definite large N limits as functions of kphys . In the\nfollowing, we always set g = 1 for N = 48 without loss of generality.\n\n\u221a\nIn all plots except for Fig. 4, we further assume g to be proportional to 1/ N. This\n\u221a\nturns out to be consistent with large N scaling, hence g \u221d 1/ N can be regarded as one of\n\nour observations.\n\n4.1\n\nOne-point function and Eguchi-Kawai equivalence\n\nIn this subsection we discuss the one-point functions, and we start with the Wilson loop\nhW (k)i. Also Ref. [16] presents some recent results about this quantity.\nIn the small k regime it can be expanded as\n\n1 4\nk htr([X1 , X2 ]2 )i + O(k 6)\n2N \u0012\n\u0013\n1 4\n1\n= 1\u2212 k N \u2212\n+ O(k 6 ),\n4\nN\n\nhW (k)i = 1 +\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere we have used the exact result (2.12). Therefore, in order to make the small k regime\n\u221a\nscale, we have to take g \u221d 1/ N , as we mentioned above. In Fig. 3 we plot hW (k)i against\n\u221a\nk/ g. The small k region scales as it should, and the results agree with the analytical\n\u221a\nprediction (4.2). Moreover the scaling extends up to k/ g = O(1).\n11\n\n\fWilson 1-point function <W>\n\n1\nN=48\nN=32\nN=24\nN=16\nsmall k prediction\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nk/\u221a\n\uf8e5g\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n\u221a\nFigure 3: The Wilson 1-point function hW i, plotted against kphys = k/ g.\n1\n\nWilson 1-point function <W>\n\nN=48\nN=32\nN=24\nN=16\narea law\n\n0.1\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2\n\nk /g\n\nFigure 4: The Wilson 1-point function hW i is plotted now logarithmically against k 2 /g, in\norder to visualize the extent of the area law behavior. The scale parameter g has been tuned\nas described in the text.\n\n12\n\n\fIf the model is equivalent to ordinary gauge theory - namely to 4D pure super Yang-Mills\ntheory with four supercharges - which is confining, then the Wilson loop should exhibit an\narea law behavior. In order to illustrate this behavior, we show a logarithmic plot of hW (k)i\nversus the area k 2 /g in Fig. 4. In this figure only, we fine-tune g as a function of N so that\nthe scaling in the intermediate regime of k becomes even better. We stay with the convention\ng(48) = 1 and use the optimal values g(32) = 1.291, g(24) = 1.563, g(16) = 1.929, which\n\u221a\nis not far from g \u221d 1/ N. The small deviation can be understood as a manifestation of\n\nfinite N effects. Fig. 4 shows indeed a region of k that corresponds to the area law behavior\n\nhW (k)i \u223c exp(\u2212const.k 2 ). Surprisingly, the area law behavior is also observed in the bosonic\nmodel, as Fig. 12 shows, which is quite contrary to what one might have expected [13, 16].\n\nIn both cases, supersymmetric and bosonic, it is not clear from the data whether the area\nlaw extends to k = \u221e in the large N limit. We will discuss the observed area law behavior\n\nfrom a theoretical point of view later.\n1\n\nN=48\nN=32\nN=24\nN=16\n\nPolyakov 1-point function <P>\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2\n\nk /g\n\n\u221a\nFigure 5: The Polyakov 1-point function hP i, plotted against k/ g.\nWe now proceed to the one-point function of the Polyakov line. In the 2D Eguchi-Kawai\nmodel [10] this quantity vanishes due to (ZN )D symmetry. In the present model, however,\nthere is no exact symmetry that could make such a quantity vanish, as we explained in\nSection 2. Note for instance that P (k = 0) = 1 for any configuration. Fig. 5 shows the\n\n13\n\n\fresults for hP (k)i. It falls off rapidly as k increases 4 . Again we observe a good scaling with\n\u221a\ng \u221d 1/ N. Remember also that hP (k)i is actually just a Fourier transform of the eigenvalue\n\ndistribution. Therefore, the value of k at which hP (k)i drops to zero, which we denote as\n\nk0 , should be inversely proportional to the space-time extent Rnew . The observed scaling\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwith g \u221d 1/ N is consistent with our result in the previous section, Rnew \u223c g N 1/4 . The\n\nresult for the bosonic case is shown in Fig. 13. We obtain a similar behavior except for\n\u221a\nsome oscillations in the large k region. In particular, scaling is confirmed with g \u221d 1/ N .\nThe value of k0 is larger than the supersymmetric k0 , as expected. The ratio of k0 in the\n\ntwo cases is indeed roughly the inverse of the corresponding ratio of Rnew (the bosonic k0 is\nabout twice as large as the supersymmetric one).\nThe above observations concerning hP (k)i and Rnew have an interesting implication on\n\nthe Eguchi-Kawai equivalence. We recall that from the results for hW (k)i, we phenomeno-\n\nlogically concluded that the Eguchi-Kawai equivalence holds at least in a finite range of scale\nfor both, the supersymmetric and the bosonic case. We would like to understand this from\na theoretical point of view. As we mentioned in Section 2, in the proof of Eguchi-Kawai\nequivalence, hP (k)i is assumed to vanish. We have found that hP (k)i is indeed small for\n\nk > k0 , but not for k < k0 . This means that the proof works for k > k0 , but not for\nsmall k, which corresponds to the ultraviolet regime in the corresponding gauge theory. We\nalso observed that k0 remains finite with respect to a physical scale in the large N limit.\nA complementary understanding can be obtained by taking Gross-Kitazawa's point of view\n[24]. As explained in Ref. [13], the extent of the eigenvalue distribution of A\u03bc determines\nthe momentum cutoff of the corresponding gauge theory [24]. The observation in Section 3\n\u221a\nthat Rnew \u223c g N 1/4 implies that the momentum cutoff remains finite in physical scale as\n\nN \u2192 \u221e. Let us assume that the momentum cutoff is finite, but large enough to attract the\n\nrenormalization flow to the fixed point which corresponds to the universality class of gauge\ntheory. Then the flow follows closely the renormalization trajectory of the gauge theory, in\na certain regime. That would explain why the equivalence holds at least in a finite range of\nscale. However, since the momentum cutoff does not go to infinity in the large N limit, it\nis conceivable that the renormalization flow will leave the renormalization trajectory of the\ngauge theory at some low-energy scale eventually. In this case the observed area law would\nnot extend to k = \u221e even in the large N limit.\n\n1 2\nOne may consider the small k expansion here, as in eq. (4.2). The result is hP (k)i = 1 \u2212 2N\nk htr(X12 )i+\n2\n* * *. The fact that htr(A\u03bc )i is logarithmically divergent means that actually hP (k)i has a non-analytic\nbehavior \u223c 1 + const. k 2 ln |k| around k = 0.\n4\n\n14\n\n\f4.2\n\nMulti-point functions and universal scaling\n\nIn this subsection we proceed to the large N scaling of multi-point functions of Wilson loops.\nWe first note that in the bosonic case, there are analytical results to all order in the 1/D\nexpansion [13].

The correlation functions should be considered as\n\u221a\n\u221a\nfunctions of kphys = k/ g, where g is taken to be proportional to 1/ N . Our results for\nthe bosonic model shown in Figs. 11 to 17 clearly confirm this analytical prediction. Let us\n(ren)\n\nconsider a wave-function renormalization for each operator, Oi\n\ncorrelation functions of the renormalized operators\n\n(ren)\nOi\n\n= ZOi , so that connected\n\nbecome finite in the large N limit.\n\nRelation (4.3) means, however, that we cannot make all the multi-point functions finite. If\nwe make the two-point functions finite by choosing Z \u223c O(N), then all the higher-point\n\nfunctions vanish in the large N limit. In the supersymmetric case, we will see that scaling\n\u221a\nis observed again with g \u221d 1/ N, but in contrast to the bosonic case a universal Z that\n\nmakes all the correlators finite seems to exist. In the following, we always set Z(N = 48) = 1,\nwithout loss of generality.\nLet us start with the two-point functions, for which we measure the following two correlation functions,\n(W )\n\nG2\n\n(P )\n\n(k) = h{ImW (k)}2 i\n\nG2 (k) = h{ImP (k)}2 i .\nWe take the imaginary part in order to avoid subtraction of a disconnected part.\n\n(4.4)\n5\n\n(Note in\n\nthis regard that since ImW (k) and ImP (k) are parity odd, the one-point functions hImW (k)i\n\nand hImP (k)i vanish due to parity invariance of the model.)

On the right we show the corresponding plot using the bosonic prediction\nZ 4 \u221d N 6 instead, which leads to an inferior level of scaling.\nFinally we comment on large the N factorization. In ordinary gauge theory, large N\nfactorization can be shown by weak-coupling expansion as well as strong-coupling expansion.\nIn a large N reduced model with Hermitian matrices, one cannot do a weak-coupling or a\nstrong-coupling expansion, because g is not a coupling constant but a scale parameter, as\nwe have mentioned. Hence large N factorization is nontrivial. In the bosonic case, large N\nfactorization holds to all orders of the 1/D expansion [13]. Our observation (4.7) implies\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n,\n(4.8)\nhO1 O2 * * * On i = hO1 ihO2 i * * * hOn i + O\nN2\nwhere the O (1/N 2 ) contributions are due to hO1 O2 icon hO3 i * * * hOn i, etc. Therefore the large\nN factorization is also valid in the supersymmetric case.\n\n4.3\n\nInterpretation of the large N scaling\n\nIn this subsection, we further discuss the physical significance of the large N scaling (4.7)\nwe observed.\nIf one views the supersymmetric matrix model considered here as a non-perturbative\ndefinition of type IIB string theory, and the Wilson loops as fundamental strings, string\nunitarity requires a large N behavior of the form N a\u03c7n for the connected correlators of n\nWilson loops, where \u03c7n = 2 \u2212 n is the Euler characteristic of the worldsheet. In order to\n\ncompare our results for the supersymmetric case (4.7) as well as for the bosonic case (4.3)\nto this behavior, we first drop the extra 1/N n factor in (4.3) and (4.7), which is due to the\n18\n\n\fchosen normalization (4.1) of the operators Oi . Then we find that the connected correlators\n\nof Wilson loops change from an O(N \u03c7n ) behavior to an O(1) behavior by the introduction\nof supersymmetry. Our results for the supersymmetric case indicate a = 0, which is not in\n\ncontradiction to the above requirement of string unitarity, but it is an extreme case where one\nis far away from a perturbative expansion in genus. It would be interesting to understand the\nresult a = 0 analytically, directly from the matrix model. From the string theoretical point\nof view this indicates that the supersymmetric matrix model might automatically realize a\nkind of double scaling limit, as it has been known from (ordinary) matrix models of twodimensional quantum gravity. In these models contributions from all genera are important.\nWhile we do not presently have an analytic understanding of the difference between the\nconnected correlators in the supersymmetric and the bosonic case, we can try to make an\neducated guess, based on the perturbative expansion (3.2).\nLet us consider the bosonic case. After integrating out the off-diagonal elements perturbatively, schematically each diagram gives a contribution\nX \u0012\n\ni1 ,***,iF\n\ng2\n(xi \u2212 xj )2\n\n\u0013L \u0012\n\u0013V \u0012 \u0013V\n1 3 1 4\n(xk \u2212 xl ) 2\n,\ng\ng2\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere xi denotes the diagonal elements as usual, and F , L, V3 , V4 are the number of index\nloops (faces), propagators (links), 3-point and 4-point vertices, respectively. They obey the\nrelations\nF +V \u2212L= \u03c7 ,\n\n4V4 + 3V3 = 2L ,\n\nV = V3 + V4 .\n\n(4.10)\n\nHere \u03c7 is the Euler characteristic of the diagram given as \u03c7 = 2 \u2212 2h \u2212 n, where h is the\ngenus (the number of handles in the diagram) and n is the number of the operators.\n\nLet us now integrate over the diagonal elements xi , under the assumption that the infrared\nregion dominates. This assumption implies that the xi 's are not close. In fact we assume\nthat they are generically separated by some scale R, which is a measure of the extension of\nour universe. Viewing the xi 's as the coordinates of the worldsheet in target space, the above\nassumption implies that the worldsheet is rough: points are scattered quite randomly. We\ncan now estimate the value for the diagram considered by simply replacing the integration\nover the xi 's by their typical separation, assuming the existence of a suitable measure which\nimplements the above hypothesis. We obtain\nN\n\nF\n\n\u0012\n\ng2\nR2\n\n\u0013L \u0012\n\nR\ng2\n\n\u0013V3 \u0012\n19\n\n1\ng2\n\n\u0013V4\n\n\u223c N\u03c7 ,\n\n(4.11)\n\n\fwhere we have used R \u223c\n\n\u221a\n\ng N 1/4 . So the assumption of infrared dominance reproduces the\n\nobserved large N behavior.\nIn the supersymmetric case, the fermion diagonal elements make the power-counting more\n\ncomplicated. However, let us naively consider the contribution (4.9). When we integrate\nover the diagonal elements xi , let us assume that the ultraviolet rather than the infrared\nregion dominates. Namely, we assume that smooth worldsheets are favoured dynamically\ndue to supersymmetry 6 . More precisely we assume that the dominant xi configurations are\nsuch that xi 's, which are connected in a given diagram, are as close together as the actual\ndistribution of xi 's allows. Above we have seen that there seems to be such a minimal length\n\u221a\nl, which is of the order g, characterizing the distribution of |xi \u2212 xj |. Replacing |xi \u2212 xj |\nwith this minimal length in (4.9) we arrive at\n\u0012\n\ng2\nl2\n\n\u0013L \u0012\n\nl\ng2\n\n\u0013V3 \u0012\n\n1\ng2\n\n\u0013V4\n\n\u223c O(1) .\n\n(4.12)\n\nThus the assumption of ultraviolet dominance leads to our observed results in the supersymmetric case. Of course it remains to be understood why there is a difference between\ninfrared and ultraviolet dominance in the bosonic and supersymmetric cases.\nIf the above naive argument is true, it also implies that the contributions in the supersymmetric case do not depend on the genus h either, and consequently that diagrams of\nall topologies contribute with equal weight. This is reminiscent of the double scaling limit\nof matrix models. For example, let us consider a Hermitian one-matrix model with the\npartition function\nZ=\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6 e\u2212N (tr\u03c6\n\n2 \u2212\u03bbtr\u03c63 )\n\n,\n\n(4.13)\n\n\u03c6 being a N \u00d7 N Hermitian matrix. The n-point correlation functions of loop operators\n\nbehave as\n\nhtr\u03c6l1 * * * tr\u03c6ln i \u223c (N\u01eb5/2 )2\u22122h\u2212n \u01eb\u2212n ,\n\n(4.14)\n\nwhere \u01eb is the parameter related to the li and to the coupling constant \u03bb as\nli \u223c\n\n1\n\u01eb\n\n,\n\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbc \u223c \u01eb2 ,\n\n(4.15)\n\nand \u03bbc is the critical coupling constant. Note that the large N behavior for fixed \u01eb is N \u03c7 ,\nwhich we obtain for the bosonic large N reduced model. When one takes the large N limit\n6\n\nIt should be remarked here that such an increased smoothness of the bosonic part in a supersymmetric\nworldsheet has been observed in toy models for superstrings [34].\n\n20\n\n\f\u22121\nwith N\u01eb5/2 = gstr\nfixed, the dependence on h disappears and the remaining power behavior\n\n\u01eb\u2212n can be absorbed into the wavefunction renormalization of each operator. In the large\nN reduced model, we do not have the parameter corresponding to \u03bb. The large N scaling\nwe observed for the supersymmetric case is formally the same as one obtains in the double\nscaling limit of the one-matrix model. In this sense, one might say that the double scaling\nlimit is taken automatically in the supersymmetric large N reduced model, and that the\nstring coupling constant gstr is not a tunable parameter but is fixed dynamically. If this is\nthe case, it should be considered as a very satisfactory feature of the supersymmetric large\nN reduced model as a nonperturbative definition of superstring theory, since we do expect\nthe string coupling constant gstr , which is related to the vacuum expectation value of the\ndilaton field, to be fixed dynamically (if superstring theory is treated nonperturbatively). It\nis also interesting that the qualitative difference of the large N behavior for the bosonic and\nthe supersymmetric case might be traced back to the smoothness of the worldsheet, which\nis itself a dynamical question to be addressed. This point needs further clarification.\n\n5\n\nSummary and discussion\n\nIn this paper, we have studied the large N dynamics of a supersymmetric large N reduced\nmodel by means of Monte Carlo simulations.\nWe studied the space-time structure represented by the eigenvalues of the bosonic matrices. In particular, we found that the large N power behavior of the space-time extent is\nconsistent with the branched-polymer picture based on the one-loop perturbative expansion\naround diagonal matrices. The effect of fermions in the space-time extent was observed\nby the enhancement of the coefficient in the power behavior, but not in the power itself.\nThe power appears to be the same for the bosonic and supersymmetric case. We emphasized, however, that the theoretical explanation is completely different. We also found that\nthe space-time uncertainty is clearly reduced for the supersymmtric case, which means that\nspace-time comes closer to the classical behavior. Even in the supersymmetric case, the\nspace-time uncertainty is found to be finite in the physical scale in the large N limit. We\nargued that this implies that the model satisfies the uncertainty principle for the nonperturbative definition of superstring theory.\nThe large N scaling behavior of Wilson loop correlators is observed at fixed g 2 N. Although this scaling of g is the same as in the bosonic model, there is a striking difference from\n\n21\n\n\fthe bosonic case in the wave-function renormalization with the multi-point functions. In the\nbosonic case, there was no universal scaling behavior: keeping two-point functions finite, all\nthe higher-point functions vanish. In the supersymmetric case, we observed a clear trend for\nall the higher-point functions to become finite in the large N limit. We gave a perturbative\nargument that this result for the supersymmetric case might be understood if we assume\nsmooth worldsheets to dominate. This argument also implies that all the topologies of the\nworldsheet contribute with equal weight to the amplitude. All these features are reminiscent\nof the double scaling limit of matrix models.\nWe also addressed the issue of Eguchi-Kawai equivalence. By searching for the area law\nbehavior in the one-point function of the Wilson loop, we concluded that the equivalence\ndoes hold at least in a finite region of scale. What is rather surprising is that the area\nlaw behavior has been observed also for the bosonic model. This suggests that the bosonic\nmodel is also equivalent to ordinary large N Yang-Mills theory at least in a finite region of\nscale, which is contrary to what has been generally believed. We argued, however, that this\nconclusion can be understood from a more theoretical point of view based on the large N\nbehavior obtained for Rnew and the one-point function of the Polyakov line. It is an open\nquestion whether this equivalence extends to the far infrared regime.\nTo summarize, we have gained new insight into the dynamical properties of the large\nN behavior of a supersymmetric large N reduced model. We hope that our findings shed\nlight on the dynamical aspects of the most interesting 10D version of our model, i.e. the\nIIB matrix model. In this respect, it is encouraging that the large N scaling of Wilson\nloop correlators in the present model has been observed at fixed g 2 N, which coincides with\nthe result obtained by requiring that the loop equations of the IIB matrix model should\nreproduce the string field Hamiltonian. We presume that a large N scaling of Wilson loop\ncorrelators - like the one we observed - also holds for the IIB matrix model; then the\nonly difference would be the spontaneous breakdown of Lorentz symmetry. One of the good\nnews revealed in the present work is that low energy effective theory, based on the one-loop\napproximation, does already capture the low energy dynamics of the supersymmetric matrix\nmodel. We therefore hope to address the most interesting issue of spontaneous breakdown\nof Lorentz invariance by using the low energy effective theory - which is in 10D far more\ncomplicated than in the 4D case. We are going to report on Monte Carlo studies of IIB\nmatrix model along these lines in the near future.\n\n22\n\n\fAcknowledgment\nWe thank T. Ishikawa, C.F. Kristjansen, Y.M. Makeenko, T.

We calculate\nZf [A] =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c8d\u03c8\u0304 e\u2212Sf ,\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere we use the notation introduced in eq. (2.1). We define a set of generators ta \u2208 gl(N,C)\nby\n\n(a = 1, * * * , N 2 ),\n\n(ta )ij = \u03b4iia \u03b4jja\n\n(A.2)\n\nwhere ia and ja are integers running from 1 to N, specified uniquely by\na = N(ia \u2212 1) + ja .\n\n(A.3)\n\nWe also introduce the notation \u0101 = N(ja \u22121)+ia . The fermionic matrix \u03c8\u03b1 can be expanded\n\nin terms of ta as\n\n2\n\n(\u03c8\u03b1 )ij =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c8a\u03b1 (ta )ij ,\n\n(A.4)\n\na=1\n\nwhere \u03c8a\u03b1 = (\u03c8\u03b1 )ia ja . \u03c8\u0304\u03b1 and A\u03bc can be expanded similarly with the coefficients \u03c8\u0304a\u03b1 =\n(\u03c8\u0304\u03b1 )ia ja and Aa\u03bc = (A\u03bc )ia ja . Note also that A\u0101\u03bc = (Aa\u03bc )\u2217 due to the Hermiticity of A\u03bc .\nWe define the structure constants gabc of gl(N,C) by\ngabc = tr(tc [ta , tb ])\n= \u03b4ja ib \u03b4jb ic \u03b4jc ia \u2212 \u03b4jc ib \u03b4jb ia \u03b4ja ic .\n23\n\n(A.5)\n\n\fThe fermionic action then reads\nSf = \u2212gabc \u03c8\u0304c\u03b1 (\u0393\u03bc )\u03b1\u03b2 Aa\u03bc \u03c8b\u03b2\n= \u2212\u03c8\u0304a\u03b1 M\u2032a\u03b1,b\u03b2 \u03c8b\u03b2 ,\n\n(A.6)\n\nwhere\nM\u2032a\u03b1,b\u03b2 = \u2212gabc (\u0393\u03bc )\u03b1\u03b2 Ac\u03bc .\n\n(A.7)\n\nWe first integrate out (\u03c8\u03b1 )N N and (\u03c8\u0304\u03b1 )N N using the \u03b4 functions in the measure (2.2). We\nget a factor of 1/N 4 followed by the replacements\n(\u03c8\u03b1 )N N \u21d2 \u2212\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n(\u03c8\u03b1 )jj ;\n\n(\u03c8\u0304\u03b1 )N N \u21d2 \u2212\n\nj=1\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n(\u03c8\u0304\u03b1 )jj\n\n(A.8)\n\nj=1\n\nin the fermionic action. The integration over the remaining Grassmann variables yields\ndet M, where M is the 2(N 2 \u2212 1) \u00d7 2(N 2 \u2212 1) complex matrix defined by\nMa\u03b1,b\u03b2 = M\u2032a\u03b1,b\u03b2 \u2212 M\u2032N 2 \u03b1,b\u03b2 \u03b4ia ja \u2212 M\u2032a\u03b1,N 2 \u03b2 \u03b4ib jb\n\n(A.9)\n\n(the indices a and b run from 1 to N 2 \u2212 1). Thus, we obtain\nZf [A] =\n\n1\ndet M .\nN4\n\n(A.10)\n\nWe first want to show that the determinant det M is real positive 7 . For this purpose we\n\nnote that the matrix M satisfies the identity \u03c32 M\u03c32 = M\u2217 . Hence if \u03c6a\u03b1 is an eigenvector of\n\nM with an eigenvalue \u03bb, then \u03c8a\u03b1 = (\u03c32 )\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c6a\u03b2 )\u2217 is an eigenvector of M with an eigenvalue\n\u03bb\u2217 . It is important that the two vectors \u03c6a\u03b1 , \u03c8a\u03b1 are linearly independent. The determinant,\n\nwhich is the product of all the eigenvalues of M, should therefore be real and positive semidefinite. In the case of 6D or 10D (IIB matrix model) versions of the supersymmetric\n\nlarge N reduced model, the fermion integral yields a complex effective action in general.\nThis causes the notorious sign problem, which makes standard Monte Carlo simulations\npractically inapplicable for large N. In the present case, since the determinant det M is real\n\npositive, we can introduce a 2(N 2 \u2212 1) \u00d7 2(N 2 \u2212 1) Hermitian matrix D = M\u2020 M, which\n\u221a\nhas real positive eigenvalues, and det M = det D. Therefore we have written the effective\naction for the bosonic matrices A\u03bc in eq. (2.11) as\nSeff = Sb \u2212\n7\n\n1\nln det D .\n2\n\n(A.11)\n\nThis has been already reported in Ref. [14] as a numerical observation. For related work, see Ref. [29].\n\n24\n\n\fWe apply the Hybrid R algorithm [18] to simulate this system 8 .\nThe first step of the Hybrid R algorithm is to apply the molecular dynamics method [31].\nWe introduce a conjugate momentum for Aa\u03bc as Xa\u03bc , which satisfies X\u0101\u03bc = (Xa\u03bc )\u2217 . The\npartition function can be re-written as\nZ=\n\nZ\n\ndXdA e\u2212H ,\n\n(A.12)\n\nwhere H is the \"Hamiltonian\" defined by\nH=\n\n1X\n1\nX\u0101\u03bc Xa\u03bc + Sb [A] \u2212 ln det D.\n2 \u03bca\n2\n\n(A.13)\n\nThe update of Xa\u03bc can be done by just generating Xa\u03bc with the probability distribution\nP\nexp(\u2212 21 |Xa\u03bc |2 ). In order to update Aa\u03bc , we use the Hamiltonian equations\ndAa\u03bc (\u03c4 )\n\u2202H\n=\n= X\u0101\u03bc ,\nd\u03c4\n\u2202Xa\u03bc\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202Sb\n\u2202H\n1\n\u2202D \u22121\ndXa\u03bc (\u03c4 )\n\u2212\n= \u2212\n= tr\nD\n.\nd\u03c4\n\u2202Aa\u03bc\n2\n\u2202Aa\u03bc\n\u2202Aa\u03bc\n\n(A.14)\n(A.15)\n\nAlong the \"classical trajectory\" given by the Hamiltonian equation,\n(i) H is invariant,\n(ii) the motion is reversible,\n(iii) the phase-volume is preserved,\n\u2202(A(\u03c4 ), X(\u03c4 ))\n=1,\n\u2202(A(0), X(0))\n\n(A.16)\n\nwhere (A(\u03c4 ), X(\u03c4 )) is a point on the trajectory after evolution from (A(0), X(0)). Therefore,\ngenerating a new set of (A, X) by solving the Hamiltonian equation for a fixed \"time\" interval\n\u03c4 satisfies detailed balance. This procedure - together with the proceeding generation of\nXa\u03bc with the Gaussian distribution - is called \"one trajectory\", which corresponds to \"one\nsweep\" in ordinary Monte Carlo simulations.\nIn order to solve the Hamiltonian equation numerically, we have to discretize the \"time\" \u03c4 .\nA discretization which maintains the properties (ii) and (iii) is known. The slight violation of\n(i) for finite \u2206\u03c4 causes systematic errors. One can in principle eliminate the systematic error\ncompletely, by making a Metropolis accept/reject decision at the end of each trajectory. But\nin the present case, the overhead for this procedure is rather large. We therefore decided to\n8\n\nRef. [30] gives an overview of effective algorithms for dynamical fermions, including the Hybrid R algorithm.\n\n25\n\n\fomit that step, and just use a sufficiently small \u2206\u03c4 . Still we can use the specific discretization\nof Ref. [18], which we explain below, to minimize the systematic error. As we explain later,\nwe do find a good convergence in small \u2206\u03c4 , and the systematic error is well under control.\nWe introduce a short-hand notation for the discretized Xa\u03bc (\u03c4 ) and Aa\u03bc (\u03c4 ),\n(r)\nXa\u03bc\n= Xa\u03bc (r\u2206\u03c4 ) ;\n\nA(s)\na\u03bc = Aa\u03bc (s\u2206\u03c4 ) .\n\n(A.17)\n\nThe Hamiltonian equations are discretized as\n(1)\n\nAa\u03bc4\n\n(n+ 21 )\n\nAa\u03bc\n\n(m+ 14 )\n\nAa\u03bc\n\n\u2206\u03c4 (0)\nX\n4 \u0101\u03bc\n\u2206\u03c4 (n)\n(n+ 1 )\nAa\u03bc 4 +\nX\n4 \u0101\u03bc\n3\u2206\u03c4 (m)\n(m\u2212 1 )\nX\u0101\u03bc\nAa\u03bc 2 +\n4\n\u2206\u03c4 (\u03bd)\n(\u03bd\u2212 1 )\nAa\u03bc 2 +\nX\n2\u001a \u0101\u03bc\n\u001b\n\u2202Sb \u0010 (n+ 12 ) \u0011\n1 (n+ 21 )\n(n)\n\u2212\nXa\u03bc + \u2206\u03c4\nAa\u03bc\nRa\u03bc\n2\n\u2202Aa\u03bc\n\n= A(0)\na\u03bc +\n=\n=\n\nA(\u03bd)\n=\na\u03bc\n(n+1)\nXa\u03bc\n=\n\n,\n\n(A.18)\n\n(n+ 12 )\n\nis defined by\n!\n(n+ 1 )\n\u2202D(Aa\u03bc 2 )\n\u03a6b\u03b2 ,\n\u2202Ac\u03bc\n\nwhere n = 0, 1, * * * , \u03bd \u2212 1, m = 1, * * * , \u03bd \u2212 1, and Ra\u03bc\n(n+ 21 )\n\nRc\u03bc\n\n= \u03a6\u2217a\u03b1\n\n(A.19)\n\na\u03b1b\u03b2\n\n(n+ 1 )\nD(Aa\u03bc 2 )\u03a6\n\n=\n\n(n+ 1 )\nM\u2020 (Aa\u03bc 4 )\u03b7\n\n.\n\nHere \u03b7a\u03b1 are complex variables generated by the Gaussian distribution exp(\u2212\n\n(A.20)\nP\n\na\u03b1\n\n|\u03b7a\u03b1 |2 ).\n\nThe judicious choice of the argument of M\u2020 is the tool to reduce the systematic error [18].\n\nWe solve eq. (A.20) with respect to \u03a6 by means of the conjugate gradient method [32],\n\nwhich is iterative. Each iteration involves a multiplication of the matrix D with some vector\n\nv. Since D is a 2(N 2 \u2212 1) \u00d7 2(N 2 \u2212 1) matrix, storing D requires O(N 4 ) memory, and\n\nmultiplying D with v naively involves O(N 4 ) arithmetic operations. Actually we can do\nmuch better than this. We first recall that D = M\u2020 M, where M is the 2(N 2 \u2212 1) \u00d7\n\n2(N 2 \u2212 1) matrix defined in eq. (A.9). The point is that the number of nonzero elements of\n\nM is only O(N 3 ) (not O(N 4 )). Indeed, the multiplication M v can be done economically\n\nas follows.\n\nWe consider\nwa\u03b1 = Ma\u03b1b\u03b2 vb\u03b2 ,\n26\n\n(A.21)\n\n\f\u2032\n\u2032\nand define the quantities wa\u03b1\nand va\u03b1\n, where a runs from 1 to N 2 as in M\u2032 , by\n\u2032\nva\u03b1\n= va\u03b1\nfor a = 1, * * * , N 2 \u2212 1 ,\nX\n\u2032\nva\u03b1 ,\nvN\n= \u2212\n2\u03b1\n\u2032\nwa\u03b1\n\nia =ja\n\u2032\nM\u2032a\u03b1b\u03b2 vb\u03b2\n\n=\n\n(A.22)\n\n.\n\n(A.23)\n\nNow wa\u03b1 can be written as\nwa\u03b1 =\n\n\u001a\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwa\u03b1\n\u2212 wN\nfor ia = ja\n2\u03b1\n\u2032\nwa\u03b1\notherwise.\n\n(A.24)\n\nThus the problem reduces to calculating the matrix-vector product in eq. (A.23). Using\ndefinition (A.7), we obtain\n(w\u03b1\u2032 )ij = (\u0393\u03bc )\u03b1\u03b2 [A\u03bc , v\u03b2\u2032 ]ji ,\n\n(A.25)\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\nand va\u03b1\n, respectively, as in eq.\nwhere w\u03b1\u2032 and v\u03b1\u2032 are N \u00d7 N matrices associated with wa\u03b1\n\n(A.4). The commutator in eq. (A.25) requires O(N 3 ) arithmetic operations. Thus we save\nO(N) operations. In addition, we do not have to store neither gabc nor M. Multiplication\n\nof M\u2020 with some vector v is done in the same way.\n\nA similar technique should be used to calculate Ra\u03bc in eq. (A.19). Note first that it can\n\nbe written as Rc\u03bc = Tc\u03bc + (Tc\u0304\u03bc )\u2217 , where Tc\u03bc is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202M\n\u03a6b\u03b2 ,\nTc\u03bc = \u03a8a\u03b1\n\u2202Ac\u03bc a\u03b1b\u03b2\n\u03a8a\u03b1 = (Ma\u03b1b\u03b2 \u03a6b\u03b2 )\u2217 .\n\n(A.26)\n\nWe define \u03a6\u2032 and \u03a8\u2032 in terms of \u03a6 and \u03a8, as we defined v \u2032 in terms of v before in eq. (A.22).\nNow we can re-write Tc\u03bc as\nTc\u03bc =\n\n\u0011\n\u2202 \u0010 \u2032\n\u03a8a\u03b1 (M\u2032 )a\u03b1b\u03b2 \u03a6\u2032b\u03b2 .\n\u2202Ac\u03bc\n\n(A.27)\n\nUsing again eq. (A.7), we obtain\n\u2032\n\n(T\u03bc )ij = \u2212(\u0393\u03bc )\u03b1\u03b2 [\u03a8\u03b1 , \u03a6\u2032\u03b2 ]ji ,\n\n(A.28)\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere \u03a6\u2032\u03b1 , \u03a8\u2032\u03b1 and T\u03bc\u2032 are N \u00d7 N matrices associated with \u03a6a\u03b1 , \u03a8a\u03b1 and Ta\u03bc , respectively,\n\nas in eq. (A.4).\n\nThere are two parameters \u03bd and \u2206\u03c4 in this algorithm. We can choose \u03bd\u2206\u03c4 so that a\ntypical autocorrelation time is minimized. We have taken \u03bd\u2206\u03c4 = 1 throughout the present\n27\n\n\fwork, and \u03bd = 200, 280, 500 for each of the cases N = 16, 24, 32, and \u03bd = 500, 600 for\nN = 48. Except in Fig. 2, we observed that the results are reasonably well converged\nat \u03bd = 500, \u2206\u03c4 = 0.002, so we just present those results. For Fig. 2 we carried out an\nextrapolation to \u2206\u03c4 = 0 by assuming the \u2206\u03c4 dependence of some observables Q(\u2206\u03c4 ) to be\nQ(\u2206\u03c4 ) \u2212 Q(\u2206\u03c4 = 0) \u223c (\u2206\u03c4 )2 * htr(A\u03bc2 )i\u2206\u03c4 .\n\n(A.29)\n\nThis assumption has been checked for htrF 2 i with the exact result (2.12). We also observed\n\nthat htr(A\u03bc2 )i\u2206\u03c4 behaves as\n\nhtr(A\u03bc2 )i\u2206\u03c4 \u223c c1 \u2212 c2 log \u2206\u03c4 ,\nfor small \u2206\u03c4 , where c1 and c2 are constants depending on N.\n\n(A.30)\n9\n\nThis implies that it diverges\n\nlogarithmically for \u2206\u03c4 \u2192 0, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction discussed\n\nbelow eq. (3.3).\n\nLet us comment on the required computational effort of our algorithm. The dominant\npart comes from solving the linear system (A.20) using the conjugate gradient method. First\nof all, we find that the number of iterations necessary for the convergence of the method\nseems to grow linearly with the size of the matrix D, namely as O(N 2 ). This is much worse\n\nthan the full QCD case with a fixed quark mass, where the number of iterations does not\ndepend on the system size. We may interpret this phenomenon as a sort of \"critical slowing\ndown\", since the present system corresponds to QCD in the chiral limit. As we have seen,\nthe number of arithmetic operations for each iteration is of order N 3 . Therefore, the required\ncomputational effort of our algorithm is estimated to be O(N 5 ).\nFor the bosonic case, we use the heat bath algorithm in the way proposed in Ref. [13],\nwhich requires an effort of O(N 4 ). We note, however, that application of a Hybrid Monte\nCarlo algorithm [33] allows for an O(N 3 ) algorithm for the bosonic case, which might be\nuseful for proceeding to much larger N.\nFinally, we comment on the numbers of configurations used for the measurements. For\nthe supersymmetric case, they are 3060, 1508, 1296, 436 for N = 16, 24, 32, 48, respectively.\nFor the bosonic case, we used 1000 configurations for each N.\n9\nIn QCD the \u2206\u03c4 dependence of the systematic error is O(\u2206\u03c4 2 ) [18]. A similar argument leads to the\nassumption (A.29). Due to eq. (A.30), the \u2206\u03c4 dependence of the systematic error in our case is expected to\nbe (\u2206\u03c4 )2 log \u2206\u03c4 .\n\n28\n\n\fB\n\nResults for the bosonic case\nFor comparison we show in this appendix the results for the bosonic case. By the bosonic\n\ncase we mean a model obtained by just dropping the fermions from the supersymmetric\nmatrix model described by the partition function (2.1). Fig. 10 shows the distribution \u03c1(r)\ndefined in Section 3. Figs. 11 to 17 show the Wilson loop and Polyakov line correlators\n\u221a\ndefined in Section 4. We take g \u221d 1/ N (g = 1 for N = 48) and plot the results against\n\u221a\nkphys = k/ g, as in the supersymmetric case. We multiply the results by (N/48)2(n\u22121) for\nn-point functions.\nThe data scale nicely in agreement with the theoretical prediction for large N given by eq.\n(4.3). For comparison we also show the 3-point and the 4-point Wilson loop correlators with\nthe renormalization factors, which were used successfully in Sec. 4 for the supersymmetric\ncase. We see very clearly that the bosonic prediction is the correct one in this case.\n\n\u03c1(r )\n\nN = 48\n32\n24\n16\n\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8 r/ g\n\n\u221a\nFigure 10: The bosonic distribution of distances \u03c1(r), plotted against r/ g for N = 16, 24,\n32 and 48.\n\n29\n\n\fBosonic Wilson 1-point function <W>\n\n1\nN=48\nN=32\nN=24\nN=16\nsmall k prediction\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nk/\u221a\n\uf8e5g\n\n\u221a\nFigure 11: The bosonic Wilson 1-point function hW i, plotted against k/ g.
