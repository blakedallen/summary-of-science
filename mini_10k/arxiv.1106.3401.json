Many of that properties were successfully explained within the Slonczewski\u2013\nWeiss\u2013McClure (SWMC) theory1 . The most accurate\nmethod to study the band structure of graphite is a\nstudy of the Landau levels (LLs) through experiments\nsuch as magneto-optics2\u201310 and magneto-transport11\u201315 .\nHowever, the interpretation of the experimental results\ninvolves a significant degree of uncertainty since, as it\nis not clear how the resonances should be identified and\nwhich electron transitions they correspond to.\nThe SWMC theory requires the use of many tightbinding parameters and provides the simple description\nof observed phenomena either in the semiclassical limit\nof week magnetic fields or for high frequencies when the\nlargest tight-binding inter-layer parameter \u03b31 plays the\nleading role16 . It is more difficult to take into account the\nparameter \u03b33 known as \"trigonal warping\". Usually, it\nis either neglected9,16\u201319 or considered numerically20\u201324 .\nThe Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition was applied in Ref.25 to find in low magnetic fields the level\nstructure including the trigonal warping. In any case,\nonly the problem of levels was considered so far, and\nno calculations of conductivities were done in order to\nevaluate the optic properties of graphite. The problem\nappearing for three-dimensional systems in the magnetic\nfield connects partly with integrating over the momentum projection kz along the magnetic field.\nThe SWMC model can be simplified assuming that\nonly the integration limits such as the K and H points in\nthe Brillouin zone produce the main contributions8,17,18 .\nSuch an approximation is similar to the theory of\nmagneto-optical effects in topological insulators26 and\ngraphene27 . However, the band extrema or the integration limits at the Fermi level can also contribute into the\nabsorption. Therefore, the analytical expression for the\ndynamic conductivity in the presence of magnetic fields\n\nis needed for the interpretation of the magneto-optics experiments.\nIn this paper, motivated by the experimental study\nof the Faraday rotation in single- and multilayer\ngraphene10 , we propose a theory of magneto-optics phenomena in graphite in strong magnetic fields including\nthe interlayer hopping parameters \u03b33 and \u03b34 in the Hamiltonian. The trigonal warping \u03b33 is considered as a perturbation with the help of the Green's function method.\nNot only the energy-level structure corrected due to the\ntrigonal warping is found, but the expressions for the longitudinal and Hall dynamical conductivities are derived.\nOur main theoretical finding is the reflectivity and the\nKerr angle for graphite in strong magnetic fields.\nII.\n\nLANDAU LEVELS IN GRAPHITE WITH\nTRIGONAL WARPING\n\nTaking into account the tight-binding parameters of\nthe SWMC theory, the effective Hamiltonian near the\nKH line of the Brillouin zone in graphite writes in the\nform of Ref.22,23\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u03b3\u03035\nvk+\n\u03b3\u03031\n\u03b3\u03034 vk\u2212 /\u03b30\nvk\u2212\n\u03b3\u03032\n\u03b3\u03034 vk\u2212 /\u03b30 \u03b3\u03033 vk+ /\u03b30 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nH(k) = \uf8ed\n\uf8f8,\n\u03b3\u03031\n\u03b3\u03034 vk+ /\u03b30\n\u03b3\u03035\nvk\u2212\n\u03b3\u03034 vk+ /\u03b30 \u03b3\u03033 vk\u2212 /\u03b30\nvk+\n\u03b3\u03032\n(1)\nwhere k\u00b1 = \u2213ikx \u2212 ky are the momentum components\nand v is the velocity parameter in the intra-layer directions; \u03b3\u0303j are the functions of the kz momentum in the\nmain axis direction\n\u03b3 \u03032 = 2\u03b32 cos (2kz d0 ) , \u03b3\u03035 = 2\u03b35 cos (2kz d0 ) + \u2206 ,\n\u03b3\u0303i = 2\u03b3i cos (kz d0 ) for i = 1, 3, 4,\nwith the distance d0 = 3.35 \u00c5 between the layers in\ngraphite.

HALL AND LONGITUDINAL\nCONDUCTIVITIES WITH THE SWMC\nPARAMETERS\n\nThe parameters of Eq. (1) used in the calculations are\nlisted in Tabl. I (see also Ref.31 ). The hopping integrals\n\u03b30 to \u03b33 are close to the values determined in observations\nof the semiclassical ShdH effect. The Fermi energy equal\nto \u03b5F = \u22124.1 meV agrees at the zero magnetic field with\nthe measurements of the extremal Fermi-surface cross\nsections and the masses of holes and electrons. Connections with the notation for the same parameters in\nthe SWMC model are given in the \"SWMC\" line. The\nvalues of parameters \u03b34 , \u03b35 , and \u2206 determined in various\nexperiments are very different, we use \u03b35 and \u2206 obtained\nby Doezema et al4 (given in Tabl. I in the \"SWMC\"\nnotations) and take for \u03b34 the approaching value. In the\nquantum limit, when electrons and holes occupy only |10i\nand |21i levels, the Fermi energy must cross these close\nlevels at the middle of the KH line. It means that the\nFermi level becomes higher at such the magnetic fields\ntaking the value \u03b5F \u2248 \u22121 meV.\nThe results of calculations are represented in Figs. 3-4.\nLet us emphasize that the imaginary part of the dynamical conductivity is of the order of the real part.\nOne can see in Fig. 3 (a), that the longitudinal conductivity calculated per one graphite layer tends on average\nto the graphene universal conductance. The main contribution in the sharp 16-meV line is resulted from the elec-\n\n\f5\n\n12\n\nThe positions of the lines for fields in the range of 10\n\u2013 30 T agree with observations of Refs.8,18 .\nThe optical Hall conductivity \u03c3xy (\u03c9) in the ac regime\nis shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b). The conductivities \u03c3xx (\u03c9)\nand \u03c3xy (\u03c9) allow us to calculate the Kerr rotation and\nthe reflectivity as functions of frequency [see Fig. 3 (c)\nand (d)]. It is evident that the interpretation of the Kerr\nrotation governed by the conductivity \u03c3xy (\u03c9) is much\nmore complicated in comparison with the longitudinal\nconductivity.\nThe Kerr angle and reflectivity shown in Fig. 4 for\nthe different magnetic fields demonstrate the strong field\ndependence of the magneto-optic phenomena.\n\n1\n\n10 T\n15 T\n25 T\n\n10\n\n0.95\n\n8\n0.85\n\nReflectivity\n\nKerr angle (degrees)\n\n0.9\n\n6\n\n0.8\n\n0.75\n4\n0.7\n2\n0.65\n\nV.\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nFrequency (meV)\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Kerr angle and reflectivity at 10, 15,\nand 25 T.\n\ntron |21i \u2192 |32i transitions (15 meV) about the K point\nwhere the |32i level coincides with the Fermi level (within\naccuracy of the width \u0393 or temperature T ). Then, the\ntransitions |22i \u2192 |21i produce the broad band. The\nlow-frequency side of the band (23 meV, at the intersection of the |21i level with the Fermi level) contributes\ninto the 16-meV line. In the same 16-meV line, the transitions |32i \u2192 |33i can contribute as well if the band |32i\ncontains the electrons.\nThe next doublet at 43 meV arises from the transitions\n|23i \u2192 |32i and |22i \u2192 |33i at the K point. The 68meV doublet splitting results due to the electron-hole\nasymmetry from the transitions |24i \u2192 |33i (65 meV)\nand |23i \u2192 |34i (69 meV) at the K point of the Brillouin\nzone.\nThe 89-meV line is more complicated. First, there\nare the electron transitions |24i \u2192 |35i (89 veV) and\n|25i \u2192 |34i (90 meV) near the K point. Besides, the\ntransitions |11i \u2192 |10i (95 meV) near the H point make\na contribution as well. All these lines obeying the selection rule \u2206n = 1 are strong. There are two weak lines\nin the frequency range. One (|24i \u2192 |32i) is seen at 55\nmeV as a shoulder on the theoretical curve. Another, at\n31 meV, results from the transitions |10i \u2192 |32i near the\nK point.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\n200\n\nJ.W. McClure, Phys. Rev. 108, 612 (1957); J.C.

Rev.\nB 15, 4077 (1977).\n\nIn conclusions, we have evaluated the perturbation theory for the matrix Hamiltonian, which permits to calculate the corrections to the eigenvalues resulting from\nthe small matrix elements particularly from the trigonal warping. We have shown that the trigonal warping in graphite can be considered within the perturbation theory at the strong magnetic field larger than 1\nT approximately. We have found that the main optical transitions obey the selection rule \u2206n = 1 for the\nLandau number n, however the \u2206n = 2 transitions due\nto the trigonal warping with the small probability are\nalso essential. The good agreement between the calculations and the measured Kerr rotation and reflectivity\nin graphite in the quantizing magnetic fields is achieved.\nThe SWMC model parameters are used in the fit taking into account the previous dHvA measurements and\ncorrecting the Fermi energy for the case of the strong\nmagnetic fields.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author is thankful to A.
