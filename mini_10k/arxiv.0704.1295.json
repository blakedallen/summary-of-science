Introduction\nThe interest in noncentrosymmetric structures, exhibiting superconductivity, has\ngrown up in the past years. There are only a few examples of this type, which\nbelong to various classes of materials, e.g. an antiferromagnetic heavy fermion\nsystem CePt3 Si [1], ferromagnetic uranium compound UIr, superconducting under\npressure [2], or non-magnetic ternary borides Li2 Pd3 B [3] and Li2 Pt3 B [4]. The main\nreason, why these systems are especially attracting, is related to the role of inversion\nsymmetry in electron pairing. The absence of inversion symmetry may suppress the\ntriplet pairing or mix singlet and triplet symmetry [5, 6, 7].\nVery recently, Klimczuk and co-workers [8] synthesised a new type of intermetallic\nlight-element based compound Mg10 Ir19 B16 , exhibiting superconductivity near 5 K.\nThis novel material also belongs to the rare noncentrosymmetric structures, and\ncrystallises in a large and rather complex bcc cell (space group I-43m) [8]. Mg10 Ir19 B16\nis partly similar to the Li2 (Pd,Pt)3 B system, since these structures contain an alkali\nmetal (Li, Mg), boron, and heavy transition metal (Pd, Pt, Ir).\nIn this work we intend to start the discussion on superconductivity mechanism in\nthis unusual compound, analysing the electronic structure and the strength of electronphonon coupling (EPC). Assuming the BCS-type behaviour in Mg10 Ir19 B16 , we study\nwhether superconductivity is driven by light boron sublattices, like e.g. in MgB2 , or\nby heavy transition metal atoms, as suggested for Li2 Pd3 B [9].\n1.1. Computational details\nElectronic structure calculations were performed using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker\n(KKR) multiple scattering method [10, 11]. The crystal potential was constructed in\n\n\fElectronic structure of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Mg10 Ir19 B16\n\n2\n\nthe framework of the local density approximation (LDA), using von Barth and Hedin\nformula [12] for the exchange-correlation part. For all atoms angular momentum\ncut-off lmax = 3 was set, k-point mesh in the irreducible part of Brillouin zone\n(IRBZ) contained over 200 points. Densities of states (DOS) were computed using the\ntetrahedron k-space integration technique, generating over 600 tetrahedrons in IRBZ.\nDue to the high atomic number of iridium (Z = 77) semi-relativistic calculations were\nperformed, but neglecting the spin-orbit coupling, which is commented at the end of\nthis paper.\n\nFigure 1. Unit cell of Mg10 Ir19 B16 . The lack of inversion centre is clearly\nseen e.g. along the main diagonal, where B1 and Mg1 atoms break the inversion\nsymmetry. Generated by XCRYSDEN [27].\n\nAs far as the crystal structure is concerned, experimental lattice constant\na = 10.568 \u00c5 and atomic positions [8] were accounted for the computation (for clarity\nalso shown in table 2). Atoms in the unit cell were surrounded by muffin-tin (MT)\nspheres with following radii: RMg = 2.82, RIr = 2.50, RB = 1.40 (in atomic units),\nfilling about 60% of the cell volume. In the primitive cell of this system, 45 atoms\noccupy 7 inequivalent sites, which all are listed in table 2. The noncentrosymmetricity\nof this system is important, and cannot be regarded as the effect of a lattice distortion,\nas observed e.g. in UIr [9]. The inversion symmetry is broken by both boron sublattices\n(B1 and B2), as well as Mg1 and Ir3 sites, thus the crystal has a half of symmetry\noperations of the cubic group Oh , i.e. only 24 operations. Among of all sublattices,\nthe positions of iridium atoms are the closest to have inversion symmetry. Since Ir3\noccupies (x, z, z) sites, with x \u2243 0.07, the full cubic symmetry is restored after shifting\nthis position to (0, z, z).\nThe analysis of superconducting properties is based on the computed McMillanHopfield (MH) parameters \u03b7 [13, 14] which determine electronic part of the electronphonon interaction, and directly enter the formula for the electron-phonon coupling\nconstant \u03bb:\nX \u03b7i\n.\n(1)\n\u03bb=\nMi h\u03c9i2 i\ni\n\n\f3\n\nElectronic structure of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Mg10 Ir19 B16\n450\n\nb)\n\na)\nTotal DOS\n\n375\n\nEF\n\n125\n\nDOS (Ry /Spin)\n\nEF\n\n100\n\n-1\n\n300\n\n-1\n\nDOS (Ry /Spin)\n\nTotal DOS\nIr\nB\nMg\n\n150\n\n225\n\n150\n\n75\n50\n\n75\n\n25\n\n0\n-1.0\n\n-0.75\n\n-0.5\n\n-0.25\n\n0.0\n\n0.25\n\n0\n\n-0.04\n\nEnergy (Ry)\nFigure 2.

Calculations of MH parameters were preformed using the rigid muffin tin\napproximation (RMTA) [15, 16, 17, 18], which gives the following expression for \u03b7 at\neach atomic site i:\n2\nX (2l + 2)nil (EF )nil+1 (EF ) Z RiM T\ndVi (r) i\n2 i\n\u03b7i =\n(2)\nRl+1 (r) .\ndr r Rl (r)\n(2l + 1)(2l + 3)N (EF )\ndr\n0\nl\n\nHere, l is the angular momentum number, nil (EF ) is the partial (angular-decomposed)\ndensity of states per spin at the Fermi energy (EF ), Rli (r) is a regular solution of the\ni\nradial Schr\u00f6dinger equation, normalised to unity inside the M T sphere of radius RMT\n,\nand Vi (r) is the self-consistent, spherically-symmetric potential. N (EF ) is the total\nDOS at EF per spin and per cell. For more detailed discussion of approximations\ninvolved in this method, see e.g. [19, 20] and references therein.\n2. Results and discussion\nThe calculated total and atomic densities of states functions are presented in figure 2.\nAs one could expect, electronic structure is dominated by iridium 5d states. The total\nDOS curve may be characterised as a collection of numerous van Hove singularities,\nreflecting the large number of atoms in the unit cell and various interatomic distances.\nThe site-decomposed DOS are shown in figure 3, and their values at the Fermi level\nare gathered in table 1. The total DOS at Fermi level is about N (EF ) \u2243 150 Ry\u22121 per\nformula unit. The densities at EF , calculated per atom, are rather low (average value\nper atom: 3.3 Ry\u22121 ), and generally EF is located outside of dominating peaks of DOS,\non a small decreasing slope of Ir DOS. Strong hybridisation of d states of Ir and p\nstates of B and Mg is manifested in the separation of bonding and anti-bonding states,\n\n\f4\n\nElectronic structure of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Mg10 Ir19 B16\n\nTable 1.

The interatomic distances,\nlisted in table 2, supports the enhanced p-d hybridisation, especially between Ir and\nB atoms (the smallest distances, 2.1 - 2.2 \u00c5).\nIt is also interesting to compare the computed site-decomposed Ir densities, to\nthe DOS of metallic f cc iridium, which is presented in figure 3(d). The shape of lower\npart of DOS in Ir2 and Ir3 is quite similar to the case of Ir-f cc. This is probably due\nto the fact, that the Ir2-Ir3 and Ir3-Ir3 coordination, as well as interatomic distances,\nare very close to the f cc phase (Ir-Ir distance is \u223c 2.7 \u00c5 in the aforementioned cases,\nsee table 2). However, the n(EF ) values on Ir atoms are much lower, comparing\nto f cc structure (n(EF ) \u2243 6.3 Ry\u22121 /spin in Ir-f cc), being the effect of enhanced\nhybridisation near EF . Noteworthy, Ir1 has a quite different atomic coordination,\nwith respect to Ir2 and Ir3 positions, being surrounded practically only by 4 boron\natoms (B1).

Conversely, the bands that cross EF are quite\ndispersive, which results in the low DOS in this energy range. Noteworthy, there is an\nenergy gap along the P-N direction (parallel to the kz axis in the reciprocal space).\nThis may suggest some anisotropic transport properties of this compound.\nThe calculated McMillan-Hopfield factors for all sites, with contributions from\neach scattering channel (l \u2192 l+1), are presented in table 1. Estimation of the electronphonon coupling constant \u03bb, using MH parameters, requires also the knowledge\nof average phonon frequencies. For such a large structure, containing 90 atoms\nin the cubic unit cell, phonon spectra calculations are difficult to be carried out.\nNevertheless we can try to investigate the strength of electron-phonon interaction\nassuming reasonable values of h\u03c9i2 i and studying their influence on estimated \u03bb values.\nDebye frequencies \u0398 of monoatomic crystals of iridium (f cc), boron (rhomboedral)\nand magnesium (hcp) may be helpful for choosing sensible phonon frequency range\nfor our discussion. At first we assume, that the same type of atoms, occupying\ndifferent sites in the cell, have similar average vibrational frequencies. Iridium, as\nthe heaviest element, is expected to have the lowest h\u03c9i2 i, Debye frequency of metallic\n\nFigure 4.

Top curve on each graph is \u221a\na sum of contributions\nfrom particular sites. Vertical lines mark the value of \u0398i / 2.\n\niridium is about \u0398Ir \u2243 36 meV (420 K) [21]. In contrast, the lightest boron is\ncertainly expected to have the highest phonon frequencies, and for crystalline boron\n\u0398B \u2243 100 meV (1200 K) [22]. Finally, magnesium average frequencies are expected\nto locate between the values of iridium and boron. Debye frequency of crystalline Mg\nis rather low: \u0398Mg \u2243 34 meV (400 K) [21]. We may also recall, that average square\nphonon frequency is often estimated as h\u03c9 2 i \u2243 12 \u03982 , which is a good approximation\nin monoatomic structures. In our case, these values may also be helpful for choosing\nfeasible range of h\u03c9i2 i.\nFigure 5 presents estimated electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bb, associated with\nparticular crystal sites, plotted as a function of average square phonon frequency. For\neach type of atoms, a wide frequency range was chosen, to illustrate the changeability\nof \u03bb. In the case of iridium, the largest contribution to \u03bb comes from Ir3 sublattice,\ndue to the large population of this site. Among boron and magnesium sites, the B2\nand Mg1 atoms provide the largest contributions. However, one has to remember that\nthis comparison is valid only if we assume identical frequencies for the same atoms\nat different sites. In this simplified analysis, we may also plot the overall coupling\nconstant for constituent atoms, by adding the contributions from each site, which is\nillustrated by solid lines in figure 5.\nAs we can see, the obtained partial coupling constants are not high for each atom.\nAt the moment, we are not aware of any experimental findings of the EPC constant\nin this compound. However, we can try to estimate the range of \"experimental\" \u03bb,\nanalysing the magnitude of the observed critical temperature. If we assume, that\nwe are dealing with BCS-type superconductivity, we may substitute the experimental\nvalue of TC = 4.5 K into the McMillan formula for TC [13]:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1.04(1 + \u03bb)\n\u0398\n.\n(3)\nexp \u2212\nTC =\n1.45\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03bc\u22c6 (1 + 0.62\u03bb)\nHowever, because the Debye temperature \u0398 of Mg10 Ir19 B16 is not known yet, we\nplot \u03bb in figure 6 as a function of \u0398, for typical values of Coulomb pseudopotential\nparameter \u03bc\u22c6 . The resulting EPC constant \u03bb varies between 0.5 and 0.75, and for\ne.g. \u0398 = 250 K we obtain \u03bb \u2243 0.60, whereas for \u0398 = 350 K we get \u03bb \u2243 0.55\n(for \u03bc\u22c6 = 0.11), as one can see in the figure 6. Thus, if Mg10 Ir19 B16 is treated as\n\n\fElectronic structure of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Mg10 Ir19 B16\n\n7\n\n0.8\n= 0.11\n= 0.13\n= 0.15\n\n\"Experimental\"\n\n0.75\n0.7\n0.65\n0.6\n0.55\n0.5\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n350\n400\n450\nDebye temperature (K)\n\n500\n\nFigure 6. \"Experimental\" value of the electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bb,\nevaluated from the McMillan formula, using observed TC = 4.5 K, plotted as a\nfunction of Debye temperature \u0398 for three values of Coulomb pseudopotential\nparameters \u03bc\u22c6 .\n\na conventional superconductor, the lower limit of \u03bb is expected to be 0.5. In order\nto get this value from our RMTA calculations, relatively low p\naverage frequencies for\nall constituent atoms are required. If we take the following h\u03c9i2 i: 14 meV for Ir,\n50 meV for B and 20 meV for Mg, we obtain \u03bbIr \u2243 0.3, \u03bbB \u2243 0.1 and \u03bbMg \u2243 0.1,\nwhich gives the expected lower limit of EPC constant (\u03bb \u2243 0.5). If higher values of \u03bb\nare experimentally observed, it will indicate either additional contributions, neglected\nwithin the RMTA framework, or even lower phonon frequencies, than the values used\nin the aforementioned\nestimations. Especially iridium contribution is sensitive to the\np\n2 i parameter, i.e. increasing it to 25 meV (probably an upper limit)\nchange of h\u03c9Ir\nresults in decrease of \u03bbIr to 0.1, that is to the value found for other sublattices.\nGenerally, our calculations indicates, that iridium sublattices seem to be the most\nimportant for the onset of superconductivity in Mg10 Ir19 B16 .\nFinally, we shortly comment the possible influence of the lack of inversion\nsymmetry and spin-orbit (SO) interaction on the electronic structure and\nsuperconductivity. The absence of a centre of inversion in a superconductor affects\nthe symmetry of superconducting state, allowing for an admixture of singlet and\ntriplet components [6, 7]. Because the singlet pairing is based on the time-reversal\nsymmetry [23], which is present as long as the compound is not magnetic, mainly\nthe triplet channel is affected by the lack of inversion, and the superconductivity may\nbe even suppressed, see e.g. [5, 6, 7]. The SO interaction, which mixes the initial\nspin-up and spin-down electronic states, plays an additional role. It was found, that\nit may control the mixing of parity of the superconducting state [7]. This seems to be\nthe case of Li2 Pd3 B and Li2 Pt3 B compounds, where specific heat [24] and NMR [25]\nmeasurements strongly support phonon-mediated isotropic superconductivity, while\npenetration depth measurements suggests an admixture of spin-singlet and triplet\ncomponents in the superconducting energy gap [26], with larger triplet component in\nthe Pt-case. This kind of experimental study for Mg10 Ir19 B16 should be prior to the\ntheoretical discussion of gap symmetry in this compound.\nAs far as the band structure of Mg10 Ir19 B16 is concerned, the modifications due\nto the SO interaction are not expected to significantly affect the obtained values of\nDOS and MH parameters. For metallic f cc iridium, our value of MH parameter,\n\n\fElectronic structure of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Mg10 Ir19 B16\n\n8\n\ncalculated also neglecting SO interaction, \u03b7Ir \u2243 135 mRy/(a.u.)2 , gives the correct\nmagnitude of the electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bb = 0.32, comparing to the\nobserved \u03bb = 0.34 [13]. Here, the average square frequency was estimated from the\nformula h\u03c9 2 i \u2243 12 \u03982 , using the Debye temperature \u0398 = 420 K.\n3. Summary and conclusions\nThe results of LDA electronic structure calculations of new Mg10 Ir19 B16\nsuperconductor were presented. The main contributions to densities of states\nnear EF are provided by iridium atoms. The electron-phonon coupling constant\n\u03bb was roughly estimated, using the calculated McMillan-Hopfield parameters and\nqualitative discussion of average phonon frequencies. We discussed the relation of\nthe experimental transition temperature and the magnitude of EPC coupling. Within\nthe rigid-muffin-tin approximation, the main contribution to \u03bb comes from iridium,\nwith smaller contributions from boron and magnesium. If any information about\nthe dynamic properties of atoms in this compound become available, our analysis\npresented of figure 5 will allow to find better theoretical estimation of \u03bb. The location\nof EF on the slope of Ir DOS peak leads to rough suggestion, that hole doping on\niridium sites, e.g. with rhodium, may increase the densities and MH parameters.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank dr Tomasz Klimczuk for helpful discussions.
