Rev. D73, 075005 (2006)], the authors presented the lepton number\nviolation mechanisms in the econimic version of the 3-3-1 model, without explicitly pointing where\nthe pseudo Goldstone Majoron lies. In this comment we clarify this point and show an extended\nversion of the model where the Goldstone Majoron becomes a gauge away would be Majoron.\nPACS numbers: 11.30.Fs, 12.60.Cn, 14.80.Mz\n\n1\n\n\fMasses for neutrinos require physics beyond the standard model (SM) connected either\nto the existence of right handed neutrinos and/or to the breaking of the Barion minus\nLepton (B\u2212L) symmetry. Besides, Majorana masses for neutrinos require the violation of\nthe lepton number; violation that can be spontaneous implying the existence of the so called\nMajoron [1], or either explicit implying the existence of a pseudo Goldstone Majoron.\nInteresting extensions of the SM are based on the local gauge group SU(3)c \u2297 SU(3)L \u2297\nU(1)X (3-3-1 for short) in which the weak sector of the SM is extended to SU(3)L \u2297 U(1)X .\nSeveral models for this gauge structure have been constructed so far, being the most popular\nthe original minimal model [2] and the so called model with right handed neutrinos [3]. An\namusing variant of this last model is the so called \"economic 3-3-1 model\" [4, 5, 6] in which\nthe spontaneous symmetry breaking and the generation of masses for all the particles in the\nmodel is done by a minimal set of only two Higgs scalar triplets.\nOne, among the many outstanding features of 3-3-1 models, is the appropriate explanation\nof neutrino masses and oscillations. The particular analysis done for the minimal version\nof the model, and for the model with right handed neutrinos, carried at the expense of\nviolating the lepton number L by two units, implies in some cases the existence of a ruled\nout Majoron [1]. But the economic version of the model presents special features as discussed\nin Refs. [5, 6] and in what follows.\nThe fermion content of the economic model is given by the following 3-3-1 anomaly free\nT\nstructure [4] : \u03c8lL\n= (\u03bdl0 , l\u2212 , \u03bdl0c )L \u223c (1, 3, \u22121/3), lL+ \u223c (1, 1, 1), QTiL = (di , ui , Di )L \u223c\n0c\n(3, 3\u2217 , 0), QT3L = (u3, d3 , U)L \u223c (3, 3, 1/3), where l = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 is a family lepton index, \u03bdlL\n\nstands for the right-handed neutrino field and i = 1, 2 for the first two quark families. The\nc\nright handed quark fields are ucaL \u223c (3\u2217 , 1, \u22122/3), dcaL \u223c (3\u2217 , 1, 1/3), DiL\n\u223c (3\u2217 , 1, 1/3) and\n\nULc \u223c (3\u2217 , 1, \u22122/3), where a = 1, 2, 3 is the quark family index and there are two exotic\n\nquarks with electric charge \u22121/3 (Di ) and another with electric charge 2/3 (U).\n\nThe Gauge Boson sector of the model includes, besides W \u00b1 and Z 0 as in the SM, five\n\nmore particles: K \u00b1 , K 0 , K 0 (which carry U and V isospin respectively) and an extra Boson\nZ \u20320 related to a second diagonal weak neutral current. The scalar sector consists of only two\nscalars triplets (instead of three as in the original model with right handed neutrinos [3])\n+ 0 +\n0\nT\nwhich are: \u03c7T = (\u03c701 , \u03c7\u2212\n2 , \u03c73 ) \u223c (1, 3, \u22121/3) and \u03c1 = (\u03c11 , \u03c12 , \u03c13 ) \u223c (1, 3, 2/3), with the\n\nfollowing Vacuum Expectation Values (VEV) h\u03c7iT = (v1 , 0, V ) and h\u03c1iT = (0, v, 0), where [4]\n\nv1 < v \u223c 102 GeV< V \u223c TeV.\n\n2\n\n\fThe lepton number L is not a good quantum number in the context of this model\n0c\nbecause, \u03bdlL\n, the third component in the triplet (1, 3, \u22121/3), is identified with the an0\ntiparticle of \u03bdlL\n, which in turn implies that L does not commute with SU(3)L \u2297 U(1)X .\n\n0\n0c\nThe lepton number assignments for this model are [5]: L(lL\u2212 , \u03bdlL\n) = \u2212L(lL+ , \u03bdlL\n) =\nc\n1, L(uaL , ucaL , daL , dcaL , W \u00b1 , Z 0 , Z \u20320 ) = 0; L(K + , K 0 , UL , DiL\n) = \u22122 =\n0\n\n0\n\u2212L(K \u2212 , K , DiL , ULc ). Then, the Yukawa coupling constants imply L(\u03c7\u2212\n2 , \u03c71 ) = 2,\n\u22121/3\n\n+\n0\n0\nL(\u03c1+\n3 , ) = \u22122, and L(\u03c11 , \u03c12 , \u03c73 ) = 0. Notice that Di\n\nand U 2/3 are bileptoquarks and\n\n0\n\nK + , K \u2212 , K 0 and K are bilepton gauge bosons.\n\nA global symmetry L of the full Lagrangean, not broken by the VEV of the scalars, which\ncommutes with the SU(3)L \u2297 U(1)X Gauge group, can be constructed via the equation [5, 7]\n2\u03bb8\n(1)\nL \u2212 \u221a = LI3 ,\n3\nwhich implies the following assignments: L(\u03c8lL ) = 1/3, L(QiL ) = 2/3, L(Q3L , \u03c1) =\n\nc\n\u22122/3, L(\u03c7) = 4/3, L(DiL\n) = \u22122, L(ULc ) = 2, L(lL+ = 2 and L(uca , dca ) = 0 (the Gauge\n\nBosons are neutral under L).\nSince the scalar sector is very simple now, the model is highly predictable. As a matter\nof fact, the full scalar potential consist only of the following six terms [4]:\nV (\u03c7, \u03c1) = \u03bc21 |\u03c7|2 + \u03bc22 |\u03c1|2 + \u03ba1 |\u03c7\u2020 \u03c7|2 + \u03ba2 |\u03c1\u2020 \u03c1|2\n+ \u03ba3 |\u03c7|2 |\u03c1|2 + \u03ba4 |\u03c7\u2020 \u03c1|2 + h.c..\n\n(2)\n\nA simple calculation shows that both, L and the lepton number L are conserved by V (\u03c7, \u03c1)\n\nand also by the full Lagrangean, except for the Yukawa interactions LY = LYLN C + LYLN V .\nThey induce masses for the fermions as follows\nc\nLYLN C = hU \u03c7\u2217 Q3L CULc + hD\nij \u03c7QiL CDjL\n\n+ hda \u03c1\u2217 Q3L CdcaL + huia \u03c1QiL CucaL\n+ hell\u2032 \u03c1\u2217 \u03c8lL ClL\u2032+ + hll\u2032 \u03c1\u03c8lL C\u03c8l\u2032 L + h.c.\n\n(3)\n\nLYLN V = hua \u03c7\u2217 Q3L CucaL + hdia \u03c7QiL CdcaL\n\u2217\nc\nU\nc\n+ hD\ni \u03c1 Q3L CDiL + hi \u03c1QiL CUL + h.c.,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the subscripts LNC and LNV indicate lepton number conserving and lepton number\nviolating term respectively. As a fact, LYLN V violates explicitly L and L by two units.\n3\n\n\fAfter spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry, the scalar potential V (\u03c7, \u03c1) develops\nthe following lepton number violating terms:\n\u221a\nVLN V = v1 [ 2H\u03c7 (\u03ba1 |\u03c7|2 + \u03ba3 |\u03c1|2 )]\n\u2020\n+ \u2020\n+ v1 \u03ba4 [\u03c1\u2212\n1 (\u03c7 \u03c1) + \u03c11 (\u03c1 \u03c7)],\n\n(5)\n\n\u221a\nwhere we have defined as usual \u03c701 = v1 + (H\u03c7 + iA\u03c7 )/ 2. H\u03c7 and A\u03c7 are the so called CP\neven and CP odd (scalar and pseudoscalar) components, and for simplicity we are taking\nreal VEV.\nNotice that the lepton number violating part in (5) is trilinear in the scalar fields, and as\nexpected, VLN V = 0 for v1 = 0. From the former expression we can identify A\u03c7 as the only\ncandidate for a Majoron in this model.\nThe minimization of the scalar potential has been done in full detail in Refs. [4]. For\n\u221a\nthat purpose two more definitions were introduced: \u03c102 = v + (H\u03c1 + iA\u03c1 )/ 2 and \u03c703 =\n\u221a\nV + (H\u03c7\u2032 + iA\u2032\u03c7 )/ 2. An outline of the main results in Ref. [4], important for the present\ndiscussion, is:\n\u2022 The three CP odd pseudoscalars A\u03c7 , A\u2032\u03c7 and A\u03c1 , the would be Goldstone bosons, are\n0 \u221a\neaten up by Z, Z \u2032 and (K 0 + K )/ 2, the real part of the neutral bilepton gauge\nboson.\nq\n\n\u2022 Out of the three CP even scalars, (v1 H\u03c7\u2032 \u2212 V H\u03c7 )/ v12 + V 2 becomes a would be Gold0 \u221a\nstone boson eaten up by i(K 0 \u2212 K )/ 2, the imaginary part of the neutral bilepton\ngauge boson which picks up L=2 via H\u03c7 . The other two CP even scalars become the\nSM Higgs boson and one extra Higgs boson with a heavy mass of order V respectively.\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u2022 In the charged scalar sector (\u03c1\u00b1\n1 , \u03c72 , \u03c13 ) there are four would be Goldstone bosons,\n\u221a\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n2\n2\ntwo of them are (V \u03c7\u00b1\n2 \u2212 v\u03c13 )/ V + v with L= \u00b12, eaten up by K , and other two\n\nwith L=0 eaten up by W \u00b1 .\n\n\u2022 Two charged scalars remain as physical states.\nCounting degrees of freedom tells us that there are in \u03c7 and \u03c1 twelve ones namely, three\nneutral CP even, three neutral CP odd and six charged ones. Eight of them are eaten up\n0\n\nby the eight gauge bosons W \u00b1 , K \u00b1 , K 0 , K , Z, and Z \u2032 . Four scalars remains as physical\nstates, one of them being the SM Higgs scalar.\n4\n\n\fSince L is explicitly broken in the context of this model by the Yukawa term LYLN V , the\nresult is that the would be pseudo Goldstone Majoron A\u03c7 , the only CP odd electrically\n0 \u221a\nneutral scalar with L=2, is eaten up by (K 0 + K )/ 2, the real part of the bilepton gauge\nboson.\nA variant of this model was introduced in Ref. [8] where the authors considered the\nfermion mass spectrum under a Z2 discrete symmetry which discards all the LNV interactions\nin the Yukawa potential(LYLN V = 0). For this variant of the model, L is conserved through\nthe entire Lagrangean, the lepton number L is only spontaneously violated by VLN V in\n0 \u221a\nEq.( 5) and the would be Majoron A\u03c7 is gauged away, eaten up by (K 0 + K )/ 2. Notice\nthat being L a good quantum number now, the spontaneous violation of SU(3)L implies the\nspontaneous violation of L via Eq. (1), something that it is now allowed because the fermion\nsector for L is vectorlike and thus non-anomalous. As attractive as the model is by itself, it\nis in someway incomplete. In fact, as a consequence of the Z2 discrete symmetry used, new\nzero VEV scalar fields must be added in order to reproduce a consistent mass spectrum[8].\nThe quark mass spectrum without making use of the Z2 symmetry is analyzed in Ref. [6].\nIn this comment, we have identified a model in which the Majoron, coming from the\nspontaneous violation of the lepton number, is gauged away. This unusual mechanism that\nwe have noticed here by the first time, has its origin in the symmetry breaking process and\nrelation (1).\n\n[1] G.Gelmini and M.Roncadelli, Phys.Lett.
