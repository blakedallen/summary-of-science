It gives start for the p\u2013p chain of nucleosynthesis\nin the Sun and main\u2013sequence stars [1,2]. In the Standard Solar Model (SSM) [3] the\ntotal (or bolometric) luminosity of the Sun L\u2299 = (3.846 \u00b1 0.008) \u00d7 1026 W is normalized\nto the astrophysical factor Spp (0) for the solar proton burning. The recommended value\nSSM\nSpp\n(0) = 4.00 \u00d7 10\u221225 MeVb [4] has been found by averaging over the results obtained in\nthe Potential model approach (PMA) [5,6] and the Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach\n[7,8]. As has been shown recently [9] the inverse and forward helioseismological approach\nindicate that higher values of Spp (0) seem more favoured. However, as has been stated by\nDegl'Innocenti, Fiorentini and Ricci [10] the helioseismological data restrict the value of\nSSM\nthe astrophysical factor Spp (0) and predict 0.94 \u2264 Spp (0)/Spp\n(0) \u2264 1.18.\nThe value of the astrophysical factor Spp (0) for the solar proton burning is very closely\nconnected with the Solar Neutrino Problem formulated by Bahcall [1] as a discrepancy\nbetween theoretical and experimental values for the solar neutrino fluxes of high energy\nneutrinos. Recently [11] following the contemporary experimental data GALLEX[12],\nSAGE [13], HOMESTAKE [14], KAMIOKANDE [15] and SUPERKAMIOKANDE [16]\nBahcall formulated three Solar Neutrino Problems (SNP's), three different discrepancies\nbetween the calculations and the observations of solar neutrino fluxes. In Table 1 we\nadduce the experimental data on the solar neutrino fluxes, whereas Table 2 contains the\ntheoretical values of the solar neutrino fluxes calculated within the SSM [3] and normalized\nSSM\nto the recommended value for the astrophysical factor Spp\n(0) [4]. According to Bahcall's\nclassification [11]:\nThe first SNP is the disagreement between the calculations and observations for the\nchlorine experiment [14]. The measured rate is 2.56 \u00b1 0.23 SNU 1 , whereas the theoretical\nprediction is about 3 times larger 7.7+1.2\n\u22121.1 SNU As has been emphasized by Bahcall [11]\nmost of the predicted rate in the chlorine experiment is from the rare, high energy 8 B\nneutrinos, although the 7 Be neutrinos are expected to contribute significantly.\nThe second SNP results from a comparison of the measured event rates in the chlorine experiment and in the Japanese purewater experiments, these are KAMIOKANDE\n[15] and SUPERKAMIOKANDE [16]. According to the SSM [3] the main contribution\nto neutrino fluxes measured by KAMIOKANDE and SUPERKAMIOKANDE Collaborations comes from the \u03b2 decay of 8 B, 8 B \u2192 8 Be\u2217 + e+ + \u03bde , in the solar core. There is\nalso a contribution from the hep reaction, p + 3 He \u2192 4 He + e+ + \u03bde [11].\nThe third SNP is related to the gallium experiments, GALLEX and SAGE. Formally\nthe experimental rates measured by these groups evidence the exclusion of all contributions save the pp neutrinos produced in the reaction p + p \u2192 D + e+ + \u03bde .\nAs has been stated by Bahcall [11] the experimental data obtained by all five solar neutrino experimental groups, GALLEX, SAGE, HOMESTAKE, KAMIOKANDE\nand SUPERKAMIOKANDE, can be fitted well within the approaches involving neutrino\nflavour oscillations, either vacuum oscillations suggested by Gribov and Pontecorvo [17\u2013\n20] or resonant matter oscillations suggested by Wolfenstein, Mikheyev and Smirnov [21]\nso\u2013called MSW effect [22]. The only forthcoming of these fits is in the necessity to make\n1\nEverywhere\np in the paper we use statistical and systematic experimental errours combined in quadrature [11] \u03c3 = (stat.)2 + (syst.)2\n\n2\n\n\fa very fine tuning of neutrino\u2013flavour oscillation parameters: 1) the squared mass differences \u2206m2ij = m2i \u2212 m2j , the mixing angles \u03b8ij and so on where the indices run over the\nnumber of oscillating neutrino flavours i(or j) = \u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 , . . ..\nAn alternative way that does not demand a fine tuning of the neutrino\u2013flavour oscillation parameters and leads to the solution of the SNP's can go, for example, through the\nreduction of the solar neutrino fluxes in the solar core caused by the decrease of the solar\ncore temperature. The former can be related to the enhancement of the astrophysical\nfactor for the solar proton burning. If one would follow the SSM such an enhancement\nof the astrophysical factor should be restricted by the helioseismological data [10]. This\nconstraint prohibits the possibility to reduce at once the theoretical values of the solar\nneutrino fluxes in agreement with experimental data. This implies that a secondary reduction is required. Such a secondary reduction of the theoretical solar neutrino fluxes\nbut taking place already outside the solar core can be induced, for example, by neutrino\u2013\nflavour oscillations. After the reduction of the solar neutrino fluxes in the solar core the\nfinal result, most likely, should not be sensitive to the mechanism of neutrino\u2013flavour oscillations. Therefore, the secondary reduction of the theoretical solar neutrino fluxes can\nbe carried out, for example, within a vacuum two\u2013flavour neutrino oscillation scenario\nwith a simplest mechanism of neutrino\u2013flavour oscillations. Below we show that this\nturns out to be enough for the reduction of the theoretical values of the solar neutrino\nfluxes in agreement with the experimental data and does not demand a fine tuning of\nneutrino\u2013flavour oscillation parameters.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give a cursory outline of the Nambu\u2013\nJona\u2013Lasinio model of light nuclei. In Sect. 3 we calculate the reduced value of the solar\ncore temperature and the solar neutrino fluxes. The experimental data and theoretical\nresults are adduced in Tables 1\u20135. In the Conclusion we discuss the obtained results.\n\n2\n\nThe Nambu\u2013Jona\u2013Lasinio model of light nuclei\n\nNowadays neither the PMA nor the EFT can provide a dynamical enhancement of\nSSM\nthe astrophysical factor Spp (0) relative to the recommended value Spp\n(0) = 4.00 \u00d7\n\u221225\n10 MeVb [4]. As has been pointed out in Refs. [5\u20139] the contributions of low\u2013energy\nnuclear forces are taken into account with an accuracy better than 1%2 .\nThe required enhancement of the astrophysical factor Spp (0) can be obtained within\nthe Nambu\u2013Jona\u2013Lasinio model of light nuclei [24\u201326], or differently the nuclear Nambu\u2013\nJona\u2013Lasinio (NNJL) model, invented for the description of low\u2013energy nuclear forces\nat the quantum field theoretic level. As has been shown in Ref. [24] the NNJL model\nis fully motivated by QCD. The deuteron appears in the nuclear phase of QCD as a\nneutron\u2013proton collective excitation, a Cooper np\u2013pair 3 , caused by a phenomenological\nlocal four\u2013nucleon interaction. Strong low\u2013energy interactions of the deuteron coupled\nto itself and other particles are described in terms of one\u2013nucleon loop exchanges. This\n2\n\nAn attempt to change the value of the astrophysical factor Spp (0) within the EFT has been recently\nKR\nundertaken by Kong and Ravndal [23]. They have calculated the astrophysical factor Spp\n(0) = (4.31 \u00b1\n\u221225\n0.35) \u00d7 10\nMeV b the meanvalue of which is increased by about 8%.\n3\nIn this connection we would like to refer to the paper by Baldo, Lombardo and Schuck [27], where\nthere has been shown that the formation of the deuteron in heavy ion reactions at intermediate energies\ngoes through the superfluid Cooper pair phase to a Bose deuteron gas.\n\n3\n\n\fallows to transfer nuclear flavours from an initial to a final nuclear state by a minimal way\nand to take into account contributions of nucleon\u2013loop anomalies determined completely\nby one\u2013nucleon loop diagrams. The dominance of contributions of nucleon\u2013loop anomalies\nis justified in the large NC approach to non\u2013perturbative QCD with SU(NC ) gauge group\nat NC \u2192 \u221e, where NC is the number of quark colours [24].\nIn Ref. [26] the NNJL model has been applied to the description of low\u2013energy nuclear\nforces for electromagnetic and weak nuclear reactions with the deuteron. There have\nbeen calculated cross sections and astrophysical factors for the neutron\u2013proton radiative\ncapture (M1\u2013capture) n + p \u2192 D + \u03b3, the photomagnetic disintegration of the deuteron\n\u03b3 + D \u2192 n + p and weak reactions of astrophysical interest such as: 1) the solar proton\nburning p + p \u2192 D + e+ + \u03bde , 2) the pep\u2013process p + e\u2212 + p \u2192 D + \u03bde and 3) the\nreactions of neutrino and anti\u2013neutrino disintegration of the deuteron caused by charged\n\u03bde + D \u2192 e\u2212 + p + p, \u03bd\u0304e + D \u2192 e+ + n + n and neutral \u03bde (\u03bd\u0304e ) + D \u2192 \u03bde (\u03bd\u0304e ) + n + p\nweak currents.\nIn the NNJL model the deuteron couples to itself and other particles through the\nnucleon axial\u2013vector current j \u03bc (x) = \u2212i [p \u0304c (x)\u03b3 \u03bc n(x) \u2212 n\u0304c (x)\u03b3 \u03bc p(x)] with a coupling\n\u03bc\u03bd\nc\nconstant gV and the nucleon tensor current J \u03bc\u03bd (x) = p \u0304c (x)\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd n(x)\nq \u2212 n\u0304 (x)\u03c3 p(x) with a\ncoupling constant gT connected with gV by the relation gT = 3/8 gV [24]. In turn, the\ncoupling constant gV is determined by the electric quadrupole moment of the deuteron\nQD : gV2 = 2\u03c0 2 QD MN2 [24], where MN = 940 MeV is the nucleon mass.\nThe reaction of the neutron\u2013proton radiative capture for thermal neutrons n + p \u2192\nD + \u03b3 plays an important role for nucleosynthesis in Early Universe [2]. For thermal\nneutrons the reaction n + p \u2192 D + \u03b3 is the M1\u2013capture induced fully by the magnetic\nM1\u2013transition. The M1\u2013capture n + p \u2192 D + \u03b3 and the photomagnetic disintegration\nof the deuteron \u03b3 + D \u2192 n + p are related via time\u2013reversal invariance. For the evaluation of the amplitude of the M1\u2013capture in the NNJL model [26] we have taken into\naccount both chiral one\u2013meson loop corrections, obtained in Chiral perturbation theory\nat the quark level (CHPT)q developed within the extended Nambu\u2013Jona\u2013Lasinio (ENJL)\nmodel with a linear realization of chiral U(3) \u00d7 U(3) symmetry [28], and the \u2206(1232) resonance treated as a Rarita\u2013Schwinger field. We have shown that within the experimental\nuncertainties of the definition of the coupling constant of the \u03c0\u2206N interaction off\u2013mass\nshell of the \u2206(1232) resonance described by the parameter Z the NNJL model fits well\nthe experimental value of the cross section for the neutron\u2013proton radiative capture. At\nZ = 1/2 favoured theoretically [29] we have got the result \u03c3(np \u2192 D\u03b3)(Tn ) = 325.5 mb,\nwhere Tn = 0.0253 eV is the kinetic energy of a thermal neutron in the laboratory frame,\nagreeing with the experimental value \u03c3(np \u2192 D\u03b3)(Tn ) = (334.2 \u00b1 0.5) mb with an accuracy about 3% [26]. Hence, we argue that in the NNJL model as well as in the EFT,\ndeveloping a quantum field theoretic approach to the description of low\u2013energy nuclear\nforces but, unlike the NNJL model, in relativistically non\u2013covariant way, all corrections\nand contributions to the amplitudes of low\u2013energy nuclear reactions are under the control. We would like to note that due to the loss of relativistic covariance nucleon\u2013loop\nanomalies are ill\u2013defined in the EFT that makes impossible any application of a mechanism of nucleon\u2013loop anomalies to the correct description of low\u2013energy nuclear forces.\nIn turn, in the NNJL model, the relativistically covariant quantum field theoretic model,\nnucleon\u2013loop anomalies are well defined and give dominant contributions.\nAs has been shown in Ref.[26] the contribution of the nucleon tensor current enters to\n4\n\n\fthe cross sections for weak nuclear reactions with the deuteron with an arbitrary parameter\n\u03be \u0304 4 . Due to isotopical invariance of low\u2013energy nuclear forces this parameter is the same\nfor all low\u2013energy weak nuclear reactions involving pp, nn or np states.\nAt zero contribution of the nucleon tensor current, \u03be \u0304 = 0 5 , we have obtained [26]: 1)\nthe astrophysical factor for the solar proton burning Spp (0) = 4.08\u00d710\u221225 MeV b agreeing\nwell with the recommended one [4] 6 , 2) the astrophysical factor for the pep\u2013process\nSpep (0) relative to Spp (0) in complete agreement with the result obtained by Bahcall and\nMay [31] 7 , 3) the cross section for the neutrino disintegration of the deuteron \u03bde + D\n\u2192 e\u2212 + p + p caused by charged weak current and 4) the cross sections for the anti\u2013\nneutrino disintegration of the deuteron \u03bd\u0304e + D \u2192 e+ + n + n and \u03bd\u0304e + D \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e + n\n+ p caused by charged and neutral weak currents, respectively, and averaged over anti\u2013\nneutrino spectrum in a reasonable agreement with recent experimental data obtained by\nthe Reines's experimental group [32].\nHence, in the NNJL model at \u03be \u0304 = 0 (or \u03be \u0304 = \u22122 that is the same) we get a dynamics of\nlow\u2013energy nuclear forces for the description of weak nuclear reactions with the deuteron\nin agreement with the recommendations of the SSM.\nOf course, one can develop a scenario of the description of low\u2013energy nuclear forces\ncontributing to weak nuclear reactions with the deuteron when the parameter \u03be \u0304 6= 0 (or\nthat is the same \u03be \u0304 6= \u22122) and tune this parameter in such a way in order to get an\nenhancement of the value of the astrophysical factor Spp (0) relative to the recommended\nSSM\none Spp\n(0) = 4.00 \u00d7 10\u221225 MeV b [4].\nThus, the NNJL model [24\u201326] 8 gives a hint that there is a dynamical reason, a non\u2013\ntrivial contribution of low\u2013energy nuclear forces induced by the nucleon tensor current\ncoupled to the deuteron, for an enhancement of the astrophysical factor for the solar\nproton burning leading, in turn, to a reduction of the solar core temperature.\nThe main goal of this paper is to analyse the consistency of this reduction of the solar\ncore temperature with the SSM, helioseismological data, the experimental data on the\nsolar neutrino fluxes and experimental data on cross sections for the reactions of the anti\u2013\nneutrino disintegration of the deuteron [32]. On this way in order to be close as much as\nit is possible to the SSM we would like to accentuate that the theoretical values of the\nsolar neutrino fluxes, their dependence on the solar core temperature and the relationship\nbetween the changes of the astrophysical factor for the solar proton burning and the solar\ncore temperature would be taken from the SSM [11]. Thereby, the theoretical accuracy\n4\nThe appearance of an arbitrary parameter in the astrophysical factor for the solar proton burning the\nvalue of which is governed by the experimental data on the cross sections for the low\u2013energy reactions of\nneutrino and anti\u2013neutrino disintegration of the deuteron has been argued recently by Kong and Ravndal\n[23] in the EFT approach.\n5\nBy checking the formulas of the cross sections for weak nuclear reactions with the deuteron calculated\nin Ref.[26] one can see that the value \u03be \u0304 = \u22122 leads to the same result as well as the value \u03be\u0304 = 0. Below\nwe would call \u03be\u0304 PT and \u03be \u0304NPT as a perturbative, close to \u03be\u0304 = 0, and a non\u2013perturbative, close to \u03be\u0304 = \u22122,\nsolution for the parameter \u03be\u0304, respectively.\n6\nIt is interesting too to compare the value of Spp (0) calculated in the NNJL model caused by the\ncontribution of the nucleon axial\u2013vector current with the old\u2013fashioned result for Spp (0) obtained by\nBU\nBahcall and Ulrich in 1988 [30]: Spp\n(0) = 4.07 \u00d7 10\u221225 MeV b.\n7\nWe would like to emphasize that the ratio Spep (0)/Spp (0) does not depend on the parameter \u03be\u0304.\nTherefore, the result obtained in Ref.[26] for the ratio Spep(0)/Spp (0) is valid for arbitrary contribution\nof the nucleon tensor current.\n8\nAs well as the result obtained by Kong and Ravndal [23] in the EFT approach.\n\n5\n\n\fof our results for solar neutrino fluxes should coincide with the theoretical accuracy of\nthe SSM of the calculation of the solar neutrino fluxes. Henceforth, only in order to\ndistinguish all theoretical quantities obtained by virtue of the reduction of the solar core\ntemperature from those calculated in the SSM we suggest to use the label ASM that\nstands for the abbreviation for the Alternative Solar Model. The ASM leaves unchanged\nall results of the SSM save the value of the solar core temperature reduced in the ASM\nwith respect to that recommended by the SSM [4].\n\n3\n\nSolar neutrino fluxes\n\nAs has been shown in Ref.

[26]) 10 .\nBelow we develop a scenario of a dynamics of low\u2013energy nuclear forces providing\n \u0304 2 \u2265 1 and analyse a consistency of this dynamics with the helioseismological data\n(1 + \u03be)\n[10], the experimental data on the solar neutrino fluxes [12\u201316] and the cross sections for\nthe reactor anti\u2013neutrino disintegration of the deuteron [32]\nThe changes \u2206Tc of the solar core temperature Tc and \u2206Spp (0) of the astrophysical\nfactor Spp (0) for the solar proton burning with respect to the values TcSSM = 1.574 \u00d7 107 K\nSSM\n(0) = 4.00 \u00d7 10\u221225 MeV b recommended by the SSM are related by [9]\n[9] and Spp\n\u2206Spp (0)\n\u2206Tc\n= \u2212 0.15 SSM .\nSSM\nTc\nSpp (0)\n\n(3.3)\n\nAccording to the helioseismological data [10] the maximum value of the astrophysical\nmax\nSSM\nfactor can be equal to Spp\n(0) = 1.18 \u00d7 Spp\n(0) = 1.18 \u00d7 4.00 \u00d7 10\u221225 MeV b = 4.72 \u00d7\n\u221225\n10 MeV b. From Eq.(3.3) it is seen that the maximum value of the astrophysical factor\ndefines the minimum value of the solar core temperature. The helioseismological data\nSSM\nmin\ngive also the lower bound on the astrophysical factor [10]: Spp\n(0) = 0.94 \u00d7 Spp\n(0) =\n\u221225\n\u221225\n0.94 \u00d7 4.00 \u00d7 10 MeV b = 3.76 \u00d7 10 MeV b. The minimum value of the astrophysical\nfactor corresponds to the maximal solar core temperature which is greater than that\npredicted by the SSM, TcSSM = 1.574 \u00d7 107 K.

This\nmeans that the enhancement of the astrophysical factor Spp (0) in the NNJL model should\nbe restricted not only by the helioseismological data but also the experimental data on\nthe cross sections for the neutrino and anti\u2013neutrino disintegration of the deuteron at low\nenergies [26].\nFirst, let us find out the maximal reduction of the solar neutrino fluxes caused by the\ncooling of the solar core up to the minimal temperature. By equating the astrophysical\nASM\nmax\nfactor calculated in the NNJL model to the maximum value Spp\n(0) = Spp\n(0) = 4.72 \u00d7\n\u221225\n10 MeV b allowed by the helioseismic data [10], we obtain the minimal value of the\nsolar core temperature\nTcASM = 1.533 \u00d7 107 K.\n\n(3.4)\n\nThus, due to the helioseismological constraint the minimal value of the solar core temperature cannot be less than the recommended one by about 2.7% 11 .\nIn Tables 1 and 2 we adduce the experimental data on the solar neutrino fluxes and the\ntheoretical values of the solar neutrino fluxes predicted by the SSM [3,11] and normalized\nto the recommended value of the astrophysical factor [4]. The theoretical accuracies of the\nsolar neutrino fluxes predicted by the SSM (see Table 2) are equal to (+15.6%, \u221213.0%),\n(+6.2%, \u22124.7%) and (+19.4%, \u221213.6%) for the HOMESTAKE, GALLEX, SAGE and SUPERKAMIOKANDE experiments, respectively. This implies that the theoretical solar\nneutrino fluxes reduced by virtue of the reduction of the solar core temperature should\nbe defined with the same accuracy. Thereby, the description of the experimental data\nwithin the ASM inheriting the accuracy of the SSM cannot be carried out with an accuracy better than (+15.6%, \u221213.0%), (+6.2%, \u22124.7%) and (+19.4%, \u221213.6%) for the\ndata by HOMESTAKE, GALLEX, SAGE and SUPERKAMIOKANDE Collaborations,\nrespectively.\nBy using a temperature dependence of the solar neutrino fluxes obtained by Bahcall\nand Ulmer [33]: \u03a6(pp) \u221d Tc\u22121.1 , \u03a6(pep) \u221d Tc\u22122.4 , \u03a6(7 Be) \u221d Tc10 , \u03a6(8 B) \u221d Tc24 , \u03a6(13 N) \u221d\nTc24.4 and \u03a6(15 O) \u221d Tc27.1 we can calculate the solar neutrino fluxes for the reduced solar\ncore temperature Eq.(3.4). The new values of the solar neutrino fluxes we have adduced\nin Table 3.\nIt is seen that the solar neutrino fluxes calculated for the solar core temperature\nASM\nTc\n= 1.533 \u00d7 107 K are still not enough decreased in order to satisfy the experimental\ndata. The next step for the reduction of the solar neutrino fluxes taking place outside the\nsolar core is in the attraction of neutrino\u2013flavour oscillations [17\u201320]. We would follow\na simplest scenario of vacuum two\u2013flavour neutrino oscillations [17,18]. By virtue of the\nvacuum two\u2013flavour neutrino oscillations \u03bde \u2194 \u03bd\u03bc the theoretical solar neutrino fluxes\nFor the parameter \u03be\u0304 we get perturbative \u03be\u0304 PT = 0.077 and non\u2013perturbative \u03be \u0304NPT = \u2212 2.077 solutions.\nThe results of the SSM can be restored at \u03be \u0304PT = 0 and \u03be \u0304NPT = \u2212 2, respectively.\n11\n\n7\n\n\fshould be multiplied by a factor [17\u201320]\n\u2206m2 L\n1\n,\nP\u03bde \u2192\u03bde (E\u03bde ) = 1 \u2212 sin2 2 \u03b8 1 \u2212 cos\n2\n2E\u03bde\n!\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere \u2206m2 = m2\u03bd\u03bc \u2212 m2\u03bde , L is the distance of the neutrino's travel, E\u03bde is a neutrino\nenergy and \u03b8 is a neutrino\u2013flavour mixing angle [17]. After the averaging over energies\nand keeping L of order of the Sun\u2013Earth distance the theoretical solar neutrino fluxes\ncalculated for the reduced solar core temperature Eq.(3.4) become multiplied by a factor\n[18]\nP\u03bde \u2192\u03bde (E\u03bde ) = 1 \u2212\n\n1\nsin2 2 \u03b8.\n2\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe result of the integration over energies Eq.(3.6) can be valid only if the quantity\n\u2206m2 L/2E\u03bde obeys the constraint\n\u2206m2 L\n\u226b 1.\n2E\u03bde\n\n(3.7)\n\nIf we would like to get the factor Eq.(3.6) for all solar neutrino fluxes including the\n8\nB neutrinos, the upper bound on the neutrino energies should coincide with the upper\nbound on the 8 B neutrino energy spectrum equal to E\u03bde = 15 MeV [1]. As the Sun\u2013Earth\ndistance L amounts to L = 1.496 \u00d7 1013 cm = 7.581 \u00d7 1023 MeV\u22121 , the inequality Eq.(3.7)\ngives the lower bound on \u2206m2 :\n\u2206m2 \u226b 4 \u00d7 10\u221211 eV2 .\n\n(3.8)\n\nHence, in order to get a correct agreement with the experimental data on the solar neutrino\nfluxes measured by HOMESTAKE, GALLEX and SAGE we do not need to make a fine\ntuning of the neutrino\u2013flavour oscillation parameter \u2206m2 [34] and to have much more\ninformation about \u2206m2 save that given by Eq.(3.8).\nThe value of the mixing angle sin2 2\u03b8 we can get fitting, for example, the meanvalue of\nthe neutrino flux measured by HOMESTAKE Collaboration. This gives sin2 2\u03b8 = 0.838.\nThe solar neutrino fluxes reduced by virtue of vacuum two\u2013flavour neutrino oscillations\nare adduced in Table 4. One can see that the theoretical solar neutrino fluxes fit well the\nexperimental data by GALLEX and SAGE Collaborations.\n8\nThe theoretical value of the solar neutrino flux \u03a6ASM\nSK ( B) fitting the experimental\ndata of SUPERKAMIOKANDE Collaboration is related to the solar 8 B neutrino flux\n\u03a6ASM (8 B). This relation can be derived by following Bahcall et al. [35].

In order to get the theoretical solar neutrino fluxes fitting the experimental data with accuracies (+15.6%, \u221213.0%), (+6.2%, \u22124.7%) and (+19.4%, \u221213.6%) for\n8\n\n\fHOMESTAKE, GALLEX (SAGE) and SUPERKAMIOKANDE Collaborations, respectively, it is sufficient to diminish the value of the mixing angle up to sin2 2\u03b8 = 0.607.

The errours of the theoretical values of the solar neutrino fluxes coincide\nwith the theoretical errours of the SSM inherited by the ASM.\nSince the theoretical solar neutrino fluxes fit reasonably well the experimental data,\nso that this evidences the solution of the SNP's in the form formulated by Bahcall [11].\nWe would like to emphasize that the agreement between the theoretical solar neutrino\nfluxes and the experimental ones has been reached without a fine tuning of the neutrino\u2013\nflavour oscillation parameters \u2206m2 and sin2 2\u03b8.\nNow we have to analyse how the maximal enhancement of the astrophysical factor\nallowed by the helioseismological data and providing the solution of the SNP's affects the\ntheoretical values of the cross sections for the reactor anti\u2013neutrino disintegration of the\ndeuteron [26,32]. On this way one can find that the enhancement of the astrophysical\nASM\nfactor up to the value Spp\n(0) = 4.72 \u00d7 10\u221225 MeV b leads to the theoretical values of\nthe cross sections for the reactions \u03bd\u0304e + D \u2192 e+ + n + n and \u03bd\u0304e + D \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e + n + p\nfitting the meanvalues of the experimentally measured cross sections with an accuracy\n1.75 \u03c3 and 1.55 \u03c3, respectively [26,32]. Such an agreement being reasonable in principle\nASM\ncan be improved by diminishing the value of the astrophysical factor Spp\n(0) = 4.72 \u00d7\n\u221225\n10 MeV b.\nOne of the ways for the optimization of the enhancement of the astrophysical factor can\nbe, for example, the following.

The errours are the theoretical uncertainties of the calculation\nof the solar neutrino fluxes in the SSM [11]. The solar neutrino fluxes given by Eqs.(3.12)\nand (3.13) and calculated at \u03bb = 2.12 and sin2 2\u03b8 = 0.780 are adduced in Table 5.\nIf there would be allowed to fit the experimental data by GALLEX and SAGE Collaborations with an accuracy worse than (+6.2%, \u22124.7%), the region of variables (sin2 2\u03b8, \u03bb)\nwould become much broader. For example, at the maximum mixing angle sin2 2\u03b8 = 1 and\n+0.41\n8\n6\n\u22122 \u22121\nASM\n\u03bb = 2.12 we obtain: \u03a6ASM\n= (2.90+0.45\n\u22120.38 ) SNU and\nSK ( B) = (2.12\u22120.29 ) \u00d7 10 cm s , SCl\n+3.70\nASM\nSGa = (59.64\u22122.80 ) SNU. Our prediction for the low\u2013energy solar neutrino flux agrees\nwith the experimental data by GALLEX and SAGE Collaborations with an accuracy\nabout 20% (see Table 1) and fits well the experimental data by GNO Collaboration. The\nexperimental value of the high\u2013energy solar neutrino flux measured by HOMESTAKE\nCollaboration is fitted with an accuracy about 12%.\nIf there would be set sin2 2\u03b8 = 1 and \u03bb = 2.40 that corresponds to the meanvalue of the\nexperimental flux measured by SUPERKAMIOKANDE Collaboration, there would have\n+0.47\n8\n6\n\u22122 \u22121\nbeen obtained the following theoretical predictions: \u03a6ASM\nSK ( B) = (2.40\u22120.33 )\u00d710 cm s ,\n+0.51\n+3.80\nASM\nASM\nSCl\n= (3.24\u22120.42 ) SNU and SGa\n= (61.30\u22122.90) SNU fitting the experimental data on\nthe high\u2013energy (HOMESTAKE) and low\u2013energy (GALLEX and SAGE) solar neutrino\nfluxes with an accuracy about 25%.

Really, the SSM\nwith the reduced solar core temperature and supplemented by the scenario of vacuum\ntwo\u2013flavour neutrino oscillations \u03bde \u2194 \u03bd\u03bc during the travel of solar neutrinos to the Earth\nproposed by Gribov and Pontecorvo [17] admits a possibility to calculate the theoretical\nsolar neutrino fluxes fitting experimental data without a fine tuning of neutrino\u2013flavour\noscillation parameters \u2206m2 and the mixing angle sin2 2\u03b8. As has been shown due to the\nreduction of the solar neutrino fluxes in the solar core for the simultaneous description of\nthe experimental data on the solar neutrino fluxes with an accuracy not worse than the\ntheoretical accuracy of the SSM it is sufficient to know only that \u2206m2 \u226b 4\u00d710\u221211 eV2 and\nsin2 2\u03b8 \u2265 0.780. The former makes the application of neutrino\u2013flavour oscillations to be\nmuch more flexible with respect to different experimental constraints on the parameters\nof the neutrino\u2013flavour oscillations [36].\nThe theoretical solar neutrino fluxes given by Eqs.(3.12) and (3.13) and calculated\nASM\nASM\nat \u2206m2 \u226b 4 \u00d7 10\u221211 eV2 and sin2 2\u03b8 = 0.780 read: SCl\n= (3.11+0.49\n=\n\u22120.40 ) SNU, SGa\n+4.38\n+0.41\nASM 8\n6\n\u22122 \u22121\n(70.56\u22123.32 ) SNU and \u03a6SK ( B) = (2.12\u22120.29 ) \u00d7 10 cm s . For the ratios of Experiment : Theory we obtain the numbers\nexp\nSCl\n+0.15\nASM = 0.82\u22120.13 ,\nSCl\nexp\nSGa\n+0.12\nASM = 1.05\u22120.11 ,\nSGa\n8\n\u03a6exp\nSK ( B)\n= 1.13+0.22\n\u22120.14\n8\n\u03a6ASM\n(\nB)\nSK\n12\n\nNPT\nFor the parameter \u03be\u0304 we obtain \u03be \u0304PT = 0.041+0.031\n= \u2212 2.041+0.031\n\u22120.009 and \u03be\u0304\n\u22120.009 .\n\n11\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fthat are comparable with unity.\nThis reconciles the experimental data of the solar neutrino fluxes by HOMESTAKE,\nGALLEX, SAGE and SUPERKAMIOKANDE Collaborations with the theoretical predictions and solves the SNP's in the from formulated by Bahcall [11].\nThe agreement with the experimental data by KAMIOKANDE Collaboration \u03a6K\nexp =\n\u22121\n(2.80 \u00b1 0.36) \u00d7 106 cm\u22122\ns\ncan\nbe\nobtained\nwithin\nan\naccuracy\nabout\n15%,\nwhere\nthe\nq\n2\n2\nerror is defined by \u03c3 = (stat.) + (syst.) .\nThe theoretical solar 8 B and 7 Be neutrino fluxes defined by Eq.(3.12) and calcu8\nlated at sin2 2\u03b8 = 0.780 for the HOMESTAKE experiments are equal to \u03a6ASM\nCl ( B) =\n+0.43\n+0.11\nASM 7\n(2.22\u22120.30 ) SNU and \u03a6Cl ( Be) = (0.57\u22120.08 ) SNU and agree reasonably well with re8\ncent data by HOMESTAKE [14] (Lande, Neutrino 2000): \u03a6exp\nCl ( B) = 2.16 SNU and\nexp 7\n\u03a6Cl ( Be) = 0.4 SNU.\nThus, we have shown that the experimental data on the solar neutrino fluxes measured\nby HOMESTAKE, GALLEX, SAGE, KAMIOKANDE and SUPERKAMIOKANDE Collaborations are consistent with both each other and the theoretical solar neutrino fluxes\ncalculated in the SSM for the reduced solar core temperature and supplemented by a\nscenario of vacuum two\u2013flavour neutrino oscillations.\nThe enhancement of the astrophysical factor being necessary for the reduction of the\nsolar neutrino fluxes in the solar core is caused by the contribution of the nucleon tensor\ncurrent coupled to the deuteron and depends on the parameter \u03be \u0304 [26]. As has been shown\nin Ref.[26] this parameter enters to the cross sections for the neutrino and anti\u2013neutrino\ndisintegration of the deuteron at low energies [26]. Thus, the NNJL model provides a\ntheoretical foundation for a new check of a value of the astrophysical factor for the solar\nproton burning in terrestrial laboratories. At present the enhancement of the astrophysical\nfactor given by Eq.(3.14) does not contradict to the available experimental data on the\ncross sections for the disintegration of the deuteron by reactor anti\u2013neutrinos [32]. The\ntheoretical cross sections fit the meanvalues of the experimentally measured cross sections\nfor the reactions \u03bd\u0304e + D \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e + n + p and \u03bd\u0304e + D \u2192 e+ + n + n [32] with an accuracy\n1 \u03c3 and 1.32 \u03c3, respectively [26].\nKR\nThe value of the astrophysical factor Spp\n(0) = (4.31 \u00b1 0.35) \u00d7 10\u221225 MeV b having\nbeen recently calculated by Kong and Ravndal [23] in the EFT agrees with the value\nASM\n\u221225\n(0) = (4.42+0.30\nSpp\nMeV b given by Eq.(3.14). The astrophysical factor in the\n\u22120.08 ) \u00d7 10\nKong\u2013Ravndal approach depends on the unknown counter\u2013term that seems to be very\n \u0304 Assuming the counter\u2013term to have a natural magnitude [23],\nsimilar to our parameter \u03be.\nKR\nKong and Ravndal have obtained the value Spp\n(0) = (4.31 \u00b1 0.35) \u00d7 10\u221225 MeV b. As\nhas been stated by Kong and Ravndal [23] the true value of the counter\u2013term can be\ndetermined from precise measurements of the cross sections for neutrino disintegration of\nthe deuteron at low energies. This is just that we have pointed out above and earlier in\n \u0304\nRef.[26] concerning the parameter \u03be.\nFor the discussion of the solar hep neutrino problem [11,37] appeared due to recent\nexperiments by SUPERKAMIOKANDE Collaboration [16] we need to calculate in the\nNNJL model the astrophysical factor for the hep reaction p + 3 He \u2192 4 He + e+ + \u03bde . The\nformer demands, in turn, the extension of the NNJL model by the inclusion of the light\nnuclei 3 He, 3 H and 4 He. This work is in progress [24].\n\n12\n\n\fAcknowledgement\nOne of the authors (A.N. Ivanov) thanks Acad.
