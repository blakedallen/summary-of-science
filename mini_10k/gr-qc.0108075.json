The\nretarded wave corresponds to the perturbation of a\nSchwarzschild spacetime in which there is no ingoing radiation. The calculation is carried out by means of a\ncharacteristic evolution algorithm. In previous work [1]\nwe applied characteristic evolution to determine the close\napproximation retarded waveform from a white hole fission. Here we find that the retarded waveform from a\nblack hole merger has distinct features which do not appear in the fission waveform: (i) an initial quasinormal\nringup and (ii) weak sensitivity to the parameter controlling the collision timescale. Feature (ii) has potential\nimportance for the design of an efficient template for extracting the gravitational wave signal from noise.\nThe close approximation [2], based on the perturbation of a stationary single black hole spacetime, has been\nextremely useful for understanding the binary black hole\nproblem by means of Cauchy evolution [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\n9, 10, 11, 12]. Our previous application of characteristic\nevolution to compute the retarded solution for a white\nhole fission [1] is the starting point for the present work.\nUnder time reversal, the retarded solution for a white\nhole fission is equivalent to an advanced solution for a\nblack hole merger. In the advanced solution, ingoing radiation is absorbed by the black holes but no outgoing\nradiation is emitted. The advanced solution [1] provides\nstage I of a two stage approach to the binary black hole\nproblem [13, 14, 15]. In stage II, treated here, we present\nthe physically appropriate retarded waveform for a black\nhole collision corresponding to the retarded solution in\nwhich there is no ingoing radiation from past null infinity I \u2212 in the background Schwarzschild spacetime.\nThese perturbative results furnish a reference point for\nthe physical understanding of a fully nonlinear version of\nthe same approach [13, 14, 15] which is being pursued using existing characteristic evolution codes [16, 17]. These\nresults also complement the physical picture obtained in\nTypeset by REVTEX\n\nthis approximation by Cauchy evolution.\nThe advanced solution for a black hole merger is simpler to compute in a characteristic approach because of\nthe relative location of the two null hypersurfaces on\nwhich boundary information is known. One of the null\nhypersurfaces is the black hole event horizon H+ , whose\nperturbation corresponds to the close approximation of\na binary black hole. In the advanced problem, the other\nnull hypersurface (in a conformally compactified description) is future null infinity I + where the outgoing radiation vanishes. Since H+ and I + formally intersect\nat future time infinity I + , they can be used to pose\na double-null initial value problem [18, 19, 20, 21] to\nevolve backward in time and compute the exterior region\nof spacetime. (Potential difficulties in dealing with I +\nare avoided by posing the problem on an ingoing null hypersurface J + which approximates I + and intersects H+\nat a late time when the perturbation has effectively died\nout.) On the other hand, in the retarded problem, the\nother null hypersurface is past null infinity I \u2212 where the\ningoing radiation is required to vanish. Because H+ and\nI \u2212 are disjoint, there is no direct way to base a characteristic initial value problem on these two hypersurfaces.\nThe advanced solution provides the ingoing radiation\nincident from I \u2212 . In the context of linear perturbation\ntheory, the time translation and reflection symmetries of\nthe background provide a mathematically well defined\nway to carry out stage II by using this ingoing radiation to generate a \"source free\" advanced minus retarded\nsolution. A retarded solution is then produced by superposition with the stage I solution. In this paper, we\ndeal with the subtleties produced in implementing this\nprocedure computationally.\nTime reflection symmetry allows the merger of two\nblack holes to be described as the fission of a white hole.\nIt is convenient here for computational purposes to formulate the binary black hole problem in this time reversed sense as a white hole fission since the characteristic\nevolution then takes the standard form of being carried\nout forward in retarded time. From a time reversed point\nof view, the stage I solution is equivalent to the retarded\nsolution for a white hole fission, with the physically ap-\n\n\f2\npropriate boundary conditions that radiation is emitted\nbut that there is no ingoing radiation from I \u2212 ; and, under time reversal, the stage II solution is equivalent to\nthe advanced solution for a white hole fission, with the\nboundary condition that radiation from I \u2212 is absorbed\nbut no outgoing radiation is emitted.\nIn Sec. II, we review the background material upon\nwhich this work is based [1]. We use a characteristic\nreformulation of the Teukolsky equations [22] governing\nthe perturbative Weyl tensor. Previous work dealt with a\ncharacteristic evolution algorithm for solving the Teukolsky equation for the ingoing null component of the Weyl\ntensor [1]. In order to carry out Stage II, we extend this\nwork to an evolution algorithm for evolving the outgoing null component. Characteristic data obtained for the\nnonlinear description of a binary black hole spacetime is\nused to induce close approximation data for the perturbative solution considered here.\nIn Sec. III, we provide the technical details of our\nglobal strategy for producing the retarded waveform from\na black hole process. In Sec. IV, we describe the numerical implementation and testing of the evolution algorithm. Because of difficult computational problems of\na global nature, we develop two independent evolution\nalgorithms and carry out extensive testing in order to\ndemonstrate that the final waveform is free of numerical\nartifacts.\nIn Sec. V, we present the properties of the retarded\nwaveform from a head-on black hole collision in the close\napproximation. It has been suggested that the black hole\nmerger waveform might have a distinct signature that is\nroughly independent of the details of the initial conditions. Our results do confirm the generally accepted view\nthat the waveform has a quasinormal ringdown stage\ncharacteristic of the final black hole mass (which is here\nthe background mass). However, we find that the features of the main waveform are sensitive to the presence of ingoing radiation fields of the type that would\nbe present, for instance, in the evolution of time reflection symmetric Cauchy data.\nNotation and Conventions: We use a metric of signature (\u2212 + ++) and a null tetrad with normalization\nla na = \u2212ma m\u0304a = \u22121, so that gab = 2(m(a m\u0304b) \u2212 l(a nb) ).\nWe introduce standard angular coordinates xA = (\u03b8, \u03c6)\nto represent the unit sphere metric qAB and set q AB =\nA\n, with q A = (1, i/ sin \u03b8).

Complex conjugation is denoted with a \"bar\", e.g. R(f ) = (f + f \u0304)/2.\nThese conventions lead to a different form of the perturbation equations from that originally given by Teukolsky.\n\nII.\n\nBACKGROUND FORMALISM\n\nVarious coordinates were used in Ref.

Israel coordinates cover\nthe entire Kruskal manifold with nonsingular and simple\nanalytic behavior.

Furthermore, the computation of asymptotic behavior is enhanced by working\nwith the fields F0 = r5 \u03a60 and F4 = r\u03a64 , which generically have finite non-vanishing limits at I + for asymptotically flat perturbations.\nAlthough the Weyl scalars formed from the (la , na )\nnull vectors are non-singular in the full Kruskal manifold, they are not well adapted for numerical accuracy. In\norder to compute radiation at late times near I + it is advantageous to consider a boosted tetrad (l\u0303a , \u00f1a , ma , m\u0304a ),\nwith l\u0303a = \u2212\u2207a \u0169 and satisfying l\u0303a \u00f1a = \u22121, which is\nadapted to Bondi time \u0169 at I + rather than the affine horizon time u. We denote the corresponding Weyl compol a mb  \u0303\nlc md and \u03c8\u03034 = Cabcd \u00f1a m\u0304b \u00f1c m\u0304d .\nnents by \u03c8\u03030 = Cabcd  \u0303\nIn particular, the late time behavior of the radiation\nwaveform can be more accurately computed by an evolution algorithm for the Weyl component \u03c8\u03034 .\nSetting \u03c8\u03030 = \u00f02 \u03a6\u03030 and \u03c8\u03034 = \u00f0\u03042 \u03a6\u03034 , the Teukolsky\nequations for the fields F\u03030 = r5 \u03a6\u03030 and F\u03034 = r\u03a6\u03034 reduce\nto the spin-weight zero forms\n\u0001\n(2.8)\nD2 + S0 F\u03030 = 0,\n\u0001\n(2.9)\nD2 + S4 F\u03034 = 0,\n\nwhere\n\n16M (r \u2212 3M )\n30M\n(6 + \u00f0\u0304\u00f0)\n\u2202\u03bb \u2212 3 +\n2\nur\nr\nr2\n4(r \u2212 3M )\n30M\n(6 + \u00f0\u0304\u00f0)\n= \u2212\n\u2202r \u2212 3 +\n(2.10)\nr2\nr\nr2\n\nS0 =\n\nand\n16M (r \u2212 3M )\n6M\n(2 + \u00f0\u0304\u00f0)\n\u2202\u03bb \u2212 3 +\nur2\nr\nr2\n4(r \u2212 3M )\n6M\n(2 + \u00f0\u0304\u00f0)\n=\n\u2202r \u2212 3 +\n,\n(2.11)\n2\nr\nr\nr2\n\nS4 = \u2212\n\nand\n2\u03bb(16M 2 \u2212 u\u03bb)\n\u2202\u03bb \u2212 2\u2202u \u2202\u03bb\n(8M 2 \u2212 u\u03bb)2\n2\u03bb2\n\u2212\n\u22022,\n8M 2 \u2212 u\u03bb \u03bb\n\nD2 = \u2212\n\n(2.12)\n\nis the Laplacian defined by the metric ds\u03042 = \u2212(1 \u2212\n2M/r)d\u01692 \u2212 2d\u0169dr induced by the background on the\n2-dimensional (\u0169, r) subspace. Equations (2.10) and\n(2.11) asymptote to one-dimensional wave equations for\nsolutions whose radial derivative falls off uniformly as\nO(1/r2 ). The limit of F\u03034 determines the outgoing gravitational radiation waveform while the limit of F\u03030 is related to the retarded quadrupole moment of the system.\nMore precisely, lim r\u03c8\u03034 = \u2202\u0169 N\u0304 , where N is the standard\ndefinition of the Bondi news function.\nIn these variables, the deviation of Eq's. (2.8) and (2.9)\nfrom a 1-dimensional wave equation is independent of\ntime at a fixed r. Because F\u03034 = (u/4M )2 F4 , where F4\nis regular throughout the Kruskal manifold (since it is\nconstructed with a regular basis), it follows that F\u03034 \u2192 0\nas the black hole horizon is approached. This facilitates\nan accurate long term evolution of the waveform using\nEq. (2.9).\nIn contrast, F\u03030 = (4M/u)2 F0 , so that F\u03030 is singular\non the black hole horizon, and thus a poor choice of variable for long term evolution. The opposite signs of the\ncoefficients of \u2202r in S0 and S4 are responsible for this\nbehavior, as can be seen by ignoring the remaining potential terms and freezing the coefficient of \u2202r at r = 2M ,\nso that Eqs.

In this approximation, both of these equations admit purely outgoing\nwaves F\u0303 (\u0169).

An ingoing F\u03034 wave behaves in opposite fashion and decays exponentially on approach to\nthe black hole.\nThe different forms of Eqs. (2.8) and (2.9) make it clear\nthat the Weyl component \u03c80 in the outgoing null direction la and the Weyl component \u03c84 in the ingoing null direction na are not related in a way which makes manifest\nthe Schwarzschild time reflection symmetry T , defined by\nT (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = (\u2212t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) in Schwarzschild coordinates or\nby T (\u0169, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = (\u2212\u1e7d, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) in terms of Bondi retarded\nand advanced times \u0169 = t \u2212 r\u2217 and \u1e7d = t + r\u2217 . The\ntime reflection symmetry could be incorporated explicitly into the pair of Teukolsky equations by introducing\nnull tetrad vectors La = \u03b1la and N a = (1/\u03b1)na satisfying T La = \u2212N a . However, the explicit form of the\nrequired boost,\nr\nr\n2M\n\u22122\u03bbu\n2M 2(r \u2212 2M )\n=\u2212\n, (2.16)\n\u03b1=\u2212\nu\nr\nu\n8M 2 \u2212 \u03bbu\n\n\f4\nmakes it clear that such a time symmetric formulation\nwould introduce singular behavior at both the black and\nwhite hole horizons.\nThis time symmetric tetrad is useful for formulating the time reflection properties of solutions of the\nTeukolsky equations using other tetrads. Let \u03a84 =\nCabcd N a m\u0304b N c m\u0304d = \u03a8(\u0169, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) be a perturbative solution for \u03a84 . Then the time reflection symmetry implies that \u03a80 = Cabcd La mb Lc md = \u03a8\u0304(\u2212\u1e7d, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) is a\nperturbative solution for \u03a80 . This correspondence maps\na retarded solution (no incoming radiation) for \u03a84 into\nan advanced solution (no outgoing radiation) for \u03a80 .

The data for a fissioning white hole is\nposed on the ingoing null hypersurface H\u2212 and an early\noutgoing null hypersurface J \u2212 , which extends from H\u2212\nto I + . In Ref. [1], consistent double-null data for \u03c84\nfor a fissioning white hole was obtained from the metric\ndata for the nonlinear version of the problem in terms\nof a spin-weight-2 field J describing the inner conformal\ngeometries of H\u2212 and J \u2212 [14].\nThe underlying field J for a white hole fission is provided by a conformal model based upon an ingoing null\nhypersurface N emanating from a prolate spheroid embedded in a flat space [25, 26]. Let (r\u0302, \u03b8, \u03c6) be standard spherical coordinates for the inertial time slices\nt\u0302 = constant of Minkowski space. When the eccentricity\nof the spheroid vanishes, the Minkowski null hypersurface reduces to the light cone from a sphere t\u0302 = 0, r\u0302 = a.\nThe intrinsic geometry of N is described by a degenerate\nrank-2 metric r\u03022 hAB where J = q A q B hAB . To linear\norder in the eccentricity, the conformal model gives\nJ(t\u0302, \u03b8) = \u2212\n\na sin2 \u03b8\n.\nt\u0302 \u2212 a\n\n(2.18)\n\nThis conformal geometry of N models the conformal\ngeometry of the white hole horizon H\u2212 in the close limit\nwhere the fission occurs in the infinite future. The area\ncoordinate r of the geometry of H\u2212 differs from the corresponding r\u0302 of the geometry of N in order to yield an\nasymptotically constant surface area for the initial white\nhole in the infinite past. For vanishing eccentricity, this\nproduces a Schwarzschild horizon and a small eccentricity\ngenerates the close approximation.\nThe Raychaudhuri equation, which governs the expansion of a null hypersurface, forces a difference in the affine\nparameters on N and H\u2212 . With a suitable choice of\n\naffine scale, the relation between t\u0302 and the affine parameter u on the white hole horizon is\ndt\u0302\n\u03c4\u0302 2 (\u03c4\u0302 \u2212 1)2\n= \u039b(\u03c4\u0302 ) =\ndu\n(3 \u2212 5\u03c4\u0302 + \u03c4\u0302 2 )2\n\u221a\n\u00134/\u221a13\n\u0012\n(5 \u2212 13) \u2212 2\u03c4\u0302\n\u221a\n\u00d7\n,\n(5 + 13) \u2212 2\u03c4\u0302\n\n(2.19)\n\nwhere \u03c4\u0302 = t\u0302 \u2212 a. At early times Eq. (2.19) implies u \u223c t\u0302\nbut as the Minkowski null cone pinches off at t\u0302 = a\nthe corresponding affine time on the white hole horizon\nasymptotes to u \u2192 \u221e. In terms of the inverted pair-ofpants picture for a white hole fission, the pants legs are\nmapped to u = \u221e, so that in the close limit the individual white holes are mapped to future infinity along the\nwhite hole horizon in the Kruskal manifold. The details\nare discussed elsewhere in a treatment of fully nonlinear\nnull data for the general two black hole problem [14, 26].\nClose limit data for J(u, \u03b8) on the white hole horizon\nis determined by integrating Eq. (2.19) and substituting\ninto Eq. (2.18). In order to eliminate nonessential integration constants, we set u = 0 at the r = 2M bifurcation\nsphere. Then, up to scale, the close data are determined\nby the single parameter\n\u03b7=\u2212\n\nJ|u=0\n1\n=\u2212\n,\nuJ|u=\u221e\n\u03c4\u0302 |u=0\n\n(2.20)\n\nwhere \u03b7 > 0 is a scale invariant parameter determining\nthe yield of the white hole fission. (In the time reversed\nscenario of a black hole collision, \u03b7 is related to the inelasticity of the collision.) In the linear approximation,\n\u03c8\u03044 \u2248\n\n1\nJ,uu .\n2\n\n(2.21)\n\nIn this way, the conformal horizon model determines\nthe close limit data for \u03c84 on the horizon H\u2212 . By choosing J \u2212 to be an early outgoing null hypersurface approximating I \u2212 , we prescribe data \u03c84 = 0 on J \u2212 , which is\nconsistent with the asymptotic falloff \u03c84 = O(u\u22123 ) along\nH\u2212 implied by Eq. (2.18). This approximates the condition that there be no ingoing radiation from I \u2212 .\nIn terms of the spin-weight-zero potential F4 , the close\ndata on H\u2212 have the normalized form\n1\nF4 = \u2212(\u039b\u2202\u03c4\u0302 )(\u039b\u2202\u03c4\u0302 ) ,\n\u03c4\u0302\n\n(2.22)\n\nafter factoring out the l = 2 angular dependence.\nThe time dependence of the close approximation data\nis quite mild when expressed as a function of \u03c4\u0302 , as\nin Eq. (2.22). However, the relationship (2.19) produces a sharp transition region where the behavior of\n\u03c4\u0302 (u) changes from the asymptotic form d\u03c4\u0302 /du \u2192 1 as\n\u03c4\u0302 \u2192 \u2212\u221e to d\u03c4\u0302 /du \u2192 0 as \u03c4\u0302 \u2192 0 [14]. For large values\nof the parameter \u03b7, this produces sharply pulse shaped\ndata [1].\n\n\f5\nIII.\n\nCOMPUTING RETARDED WAVEFORMS\nFROM BLACK HOLES\nA.\n\nRemoving the ingoing radiation\n\nIn the time reversed scenario being pursued here, our\nstrategy for computing the retarded solution for a black\nhole collision is based upon the computation of the advanced solution from a white hole fission. Stage I of the\napproach, i.e. computation of the retarded solution for a\nwhite hole fission, has already been carried out [1]. Close\napproximation data for \u03c84 provided by the conformal\nhorizon model was evolved to determine the stage I solution \u03c84,I throughout the exterior region of spacetime.\nIn practice, the evolution computes the corresponding\nspin-weight-0 potential F\u03034,I , whose value on I + determines the outgoing radiation field F\u03034,I,OUT . In stage I\nof the white hole problem, there is no ingoing radiation\nfrom I \u2212 . In stage II, the strategy for converting the retarded solution to an advanced solution with no outgoing\nradiation is to superpose a perturbative solution whose\noutgoing field equals \u2212F\u03034,I,OUT .\nThis procedure for converting from an advanced to a\nretarded field in a white hole spacetime differs from the\nstandard procedure in a flat spacetime. The retarded\nsolution \u03a6RET of the flat space wave equation \u2737\u03a6 = S\nwith source S may be converted into the advanced solution \u03a6ADV by superposing the source free (homogeneous)\nsolution H = \u03a6ADV \u2212 \u03a6RET . In the vacuum white hole\n(or black hole) problem, there is no source in the exterior spacetime. The white hole horizon itself acts as the\nsource of the exterior solution. In this vein, specification\nof the \"source-free\" solution which transforms a retarded\nwhite hole perturbation to an advanced white hole perturbation requires specification of horizon data on H+ as\nwell as the outgoing data \u2212F\u03034,I,OUT at I + . This horizon data must not introduce any features which change\nthe physical interpretation of the system as a white hole\nfission. For example, It is essential not to superpose a\nblack hole merger on the white hole fission, as would result in the specification of a Cauchy problem with time\nsymmetric data.\nWe carry out the conversion to an advanced solution\nby evolving backward in time the double null problem\nwith data F\u03034 = 0 on the black hole horizon H+ and data\nF\u03034 = \u2212F4,I,OUT at I + . This data leaves the black hole\nhorizon unchanged and its evolution determines the analogue of the \"homogeneous solution\" H. The superposition F\u03034,II = F\u03034,I +H then produces the desired advanced\nsolution for a white hole fission with no outgoing radiation. The stage II solution leaves the black hole horizon\nunchanged but perturbs the white hole, essentially making it ring. In the time reversed black hole scenario, this\nis a physically desirable effect because the binary black\nhole data provided by the conformal horizon model has\na power law decay in u, which corresponds to a purely\nexponential decay in \u0169 without quasinormal oscillations.\nA priori introduction of ringdown in the final black hole\n\ndata would be artificial. In stage II, the conversion from\nan advanced to retarded binary black hole solution automatically introduces this ringdown in a natural way in\naddition to removing the ingoing radiation.\n\nB.\n\nProducing the outgoing waveform\n\nThe Weyl components \u03c8\u03030 and \u03c8\u03034 form the major part\nof the geometrical description of a Schwarzschild perturbation. The waveform at I + is described directly by \u03c8\u03034 .\nStage II provides indirect waveform information in terms\nof \u03c8\u03030 , which can then be used to obtain the waveform\nby means of differential relations between \u03c8\u03030 and \u03c8\u03034 .\nAsymptotically, at I + , these differential relations can be\nobtained either from the vacuum Bianchi identities [27]\nor from the asymptotic behavior of the metric [28, 29, 30].\nHere we present the latter metric approach, since it provides a complete asymptotic description of Schwarzschild\nperturbations.\nIn the (\u0169, r, xA ) Bondi coordinates with background\nSchwarzschild metric (2.3), a vacuum perturbation near\nI + perturbs the metric in the asymptotically flat\nform [30]\n\u03b4gar = \u03b4gAB q A q\u0304 B = 0,\n2M\n1\n\u03b4g\u0169\u0169 =\n+ O( 2 ),\nr\nr\n\u00f0\u0304C\n2L\n1\n\u03b4g\u0169A q A =\n+\n+ O( 2 ),\n4\n3r\nr\n1\nQ\nA B\n\u03b4gAB q q = Cr + + O( 2 ),\nr\nr\n\n(3.1)\n(3.2)\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\n\nwhere C, Q, M and L are spin-weighted functions of\n(\u0169, xA ). The spin-weight-2 functions C and Q comprise\nthe asymptotic part of the initial null data, in metric\nform, on a constant \u0169 hypersurface. In Bondi's terminology, the spin-weight-0 function M is the (perturbed)\nmass aspect of the system and the spin-weight 1 function\nL is the angular momentum aspect. The time derivative of \u03b4gAB q A q B can be determined from the evolution\nequations. The time derivative \u2202\u0169 C is the Bondi news\nfunction and requires a radial integration to determine\nits value in terms of a boundary condition on an inner\nworldtube. The time derivative of Q can be determined\nlocally. Similarly, the time derivatives of M and L can\nbe determined locally from the components of Einstein's\nequations representing conservation laws.

There is no nonsingular way to\ntreat time infinity as a boundary in a conformally compactified manifold, as is possible for null infinity. Thus\ntime infinity can only be approached asymptotically and\nthe asymptotic values of fields can depend on the direction of approach. This direction dependent limit at I +\nmakes an evolution of \u03c80 difficult.\nNumerical difficulties have led us to implement the\nStage II evolution of F\u03030 using two distinct approaches,\none based upon a retarded time foliation and the other\non an advanced time foliation. Both approaches require\nfinding variables which allow for stable evolution of waves\npropagating inside the peak of the Schwarzschild potential, which turns out to be difficult. The retarded time\nalgorithm uses an evolution variable which is adapted to\nthe falloff at I + , and the advanced time algorithm uses\nan evolution variable adapted to the falloff at I \u2212 . Both\napproaches have similar accuracy but the advanced time\nalgorithm is more efficient at treating behavior near H+\nand the retarded time algorithm is more efficient near\nI +.\nA.\n\nRetarded time algorithm\n\nWe base the retarded time algorithm on the evolution\nvariable\nF\u03020 = (1 \u2212 2M/r)2 F\u03030 ,\n+\n\n(4.1)\n\n+\n\nwhich is finite on H , as well as on I where the waveform is read off. However, the factor (1 \u2212 2M/r)2 , which\nmakes F\u03020 vanish identically on H\u2212 , introduces a singularity at H\u2212 in the associated Teukolsky equation. In addition, F\u03020 is infinite on I \u2212 . We deal with these problems\nby initializing the double-null problem on an ingoing null\nhypersurface K\u2212 approximating H\u2212 and on an outgoing\nnull hypersurface J \u2212 approximating I \u2212 .\nIn (\u0169, \u1e7d) double null coordinates, the Teukolsky equation for F\u03020 (l = 2) is\n2(1 \u2212 2M/r)\n2M\n\u2202\u1e7d \u2212 2 \u2202\u0169\nr\n\u0013 r\n3M (1 \u2212 2M/r)\n+\nF\u03020 = 0.\n2r3\n\n(\u2202\u0169 \u2202\u1e7d +\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe code is implemented in coordinates (\u0169, \u03c1), where \u03c1 =\narctan(\u1e7d/\u03b1) and \u03b1 is an adjustable parameter (typically\n\n\f7\n\u03b1 = 40M ). These coordinates compactify I + at \u03c1 = \u03c0/2.\nThe Teukolsky equation takes the form\n2 (r \u2212 2M )\n\u2202\u03c1 F\u03020\nr2\n\u0001\n2\n2\u03b1 1 + tan \u03c1\n\u2202\u0169 F\u03020\n+\nr2\n\u0001\n3 \u03b1 (r \u2212 2M ) 1 + tan2 \u03c1\n\u2212\nF\u03020 ,\n2\nr4\n\n\u2202\u0169 \u2202\u03c1 F\u03020 = \u2212\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhich is nonsingular in the region \u2212\u03c0/2 < \u03c1 < \u03c0/2.\nHowever, compactification of I + using double null coordinates necessarily leads to a loss of differentiability at\nI + [31]. The coefficients in Eq. (4.3) have finite limits at I + , but the \u2202\u0169 F\u03020 coefficient is not differentiable\nat I + . In (\u0169, l = 1/r) coordinates F\u03020 can have analytic\ndependence on l at I + but the transformation to (\u0169, \u03c1)\ncoordinates introduces logarithmic behavior so that F\u03020\nis not twice differentiable with respect to \u03c1 at I + . Our\ntests show this still allows the computation of F\u03020 on I +\nto 2nd order accuracy in grid size. Similar logarithmic\nbehavior exists at I + in our original Stage I algorithm\n[1].\nWe implement Eq.

We solve Eqs. (4.4) and (4.5) using\na 2nd order accurate Runge-Kutta scheme.\nB.\n\nAlthough the advanced time algorithm can be initialized\non I \u2212 this gives no distinct advantage in computing the\nwaveform at I + and, in order to facilitate comparison\nwith the retarded time algorithm, we initialize on an outgoing null hypersurface J \u2212 which approximates I \u2212 .\nThe advanced time evolution variable F\u03060 satisfies\n\u0012\n2(r \u2212 3M )\n\u2202\u0169 \u2202\u1e7d +\n\u2202\u0169\nr2\n\u0013\n(1 \u2212 2M/r)(2r + 3M )\nF\u03060 = 0.

(Under time reflection, F\u03060 = 4T F\u03034 ).\nThus the advanced time algorithm is equivalent to an\nalgorithm for evolving F\u03034 backward in time.\nThe evolution proceeds along \u1e7d = const null hypersurfaces, which are compactified by the coordinate transformation \u0169 = \u03b1 tan \u03bc, where \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 \u03c0/2 in the range\nfrom I \u2212 to H+ , and \u03b1 is again an adjustable parameter (typically \u03b1 = 200M in the advanced time case).

On an ingoing null hypersurface, F\u03060 can\nbe expressed as a power series in l = 1/r. This implies\nthat the associated series in \u03bc contains logarithmic terms\nof the form \u03bc(1 + \u03bc log \u03bc), and is not twice differentiable\n(with respect to \u03bc) on I \u2212 .

Since F\u03060 automatically\nvanishes on H\u2212 , we must again initialize on an ingoing\nnull hypersurface K\u2212 approximating H\u2212 . In addition, F\u03060\nvanishes on I + . Consequently, the signal on I + must be\nobtained by transforming F\u03060 to F\u03020 on successively farther out \u1e7d = const slices and extrapolating to \u1e7d = \u221e.\n\n(4.9)\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere we have introduced the auxiliary variable \u011f. The\nnumerical (\u03bc, \u1e7d) grid consists of points on the \u1e7d = const\nfoliation equidistant in \u03bc. The hypersurface equation\n(4.9) is solved by 2nd order accurate integration and Eq.\n(4.10) is solved by a 2nd order accurate Runge-Kutta\nscheme.\nC.\n\nExtracting the Retarded Waveform\n\nThe retarded waveform F\u03034 on I + is obtained from F\u03030\nby means of Eq. (3.13). Given the values of F\u03030 , we\n\n\f8\nintegrate Eq. (3.13) by the midpoint rule to obtain F\u03034 ,\nusing the initial condition that F\u03034 = 0.\nThe retarded algorithm provides F\u03030 on I + directly. In\nthe advanced algorithm, where I + is not in the evolution domain, we extrapolate the waveform at I + from\na quadratic polynomial based upon approximate values\nof F\u03034 obtained by applying Eq. (3.13) on three ingoing\nnull hypersurfaces approximating I + (where we substitute r4 F\u03060 for F\u03030 ). The three null hypersurfaces consist\nof the advanced time slices \u1e7df , \u1e7df /2, and \u1e7df /3, where\n(typically) \u1e7df = 4000M .\n\n4e+09\n\n2e+09\n\n0e+00\n\n\u22122e+09\nF\u03030\n\nD.\n\nInitializing the Stage II evolution\n\u22124e+09\n\nInitial data for the stage II evolution, i.e. the value of\n\u03c8\u03030 on J \u2212 , is obtained by a time reflection of the retarded\nStage I solution for \u03c8\u03034 on J + . Technical problems arise\nhere because the stage I evolution does not provide accurate data at late times on J + [1]. We deal with this\nby smoothing the Stage II initial data to zero outside a\nregion of compact support where the data would otherwise be small. This modification of the initial data also\nguarantees consistency with the boundary data \u03c80 = 0\non K\u2212 , which approximates the boundary condition that\nthe perturbation vanishes on H\u2212 .\nThe relation \u03c8\u030340 = \u2202\u0169 N\u0304 on I + requires that the integral\nZ \u221e\nd\u0169\u03c8\u030340 = N\u0304 |\u221e\n(4.11)\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\nvanish since the news function N must vanish at either\nlimit in order that the radiated mass loss be finite.

However, artificially truncating the initial data\nto compact support causes this integral to be non-zero,\nalthough small. This leads to the following artificial behavior of F\u03030 at early retarded times.\nThis early time behavior of F\u03060 is conveniently described in coordinates (\u1e7d, l = 1/r) which compactify I \u2212\nat l = 0.

The solid curve indicates a fit to a cubic\npolynomial.\n\nwhere according to the above argument a(\u1e7d) should vanish for \u1e7d \u2265 \u1e7db . However, our numerical procedure for\ntruncating the data leads to a small value of a(\u1e7db ). Hence,\nfor \u1e7d \u2265 \u1e7db , on any ingoing null hypersurface, F\u03060 has the\nasymptotic behavior F\u03060 (\u1e7d, l) = a(\u1e7db )l + O(l2 ). When reexpressed in (\u0169, \u1e7d) double null coordinates, this implies\nF\u03030 has the asymptotic behavior F\u03030 (\u0169, \u1e7d) = a(\u1e7db )\u01693 +\nO(\u01692 ). In numerical simulations, this produces artificial\ncubic polynomial dependence of F\u03030 at early times on I + .\nSince this cubic behavior is removed by taking four \u0169derivatives it does not affect the waveform F\u03034 calculated\nfrom F\u03030 using Eq. (3.13).\nWe simulated this artificial early time behavior by using the advanced time algorithm to propagate an extremely narrow initial compact support pulse on I \u2212 of\n4\nthe form F\u03060 = [(\u1e7d \u2212 \u1e7d1 )(\u1e7d2 \u2212 \u1e7d)] for \u1e7d1 < \u1e7d < \u1e7d2 , and\nF\u03060 = 0 otherwise, where \u1e7d2 \u2212 \u1e7d1 = .1M .

The\nfigure shows that the early time behavior fits a cubic\npolynomial in \u0169. This cubic polynomial dominates at\nlater times and masks physical effects such as quasinormal ringdown. However, Fig. 2 shows that after taking\nfour \u0169-derivatives the ringdown is clearly observed and\nthere is little trace of the secular behavior.

We\nperformed the following experiments to measure the sensitivity of the Stage II signal to the location of K\u2212 and\nJ \u2212 . In these experiments we used a Stage I run to obtain close approximation initial data with \u03b7 = 1410 for F\u03030\non J \u2212 and measured the signal propagated to I + . Except when computational expense would have been prohibitive, the experiments were carried out with both the\nretarded time and advanced time evolution algorithms\nwith virtually equivalent results.\nIn the first set of experiments, K\u2212 was placed at\n\u1e7d = \u2212200M and \u1e7d = \u2212100M , with the initial hypersurface J \u2212 located at \u0169 = \u2212720M in both cases. For\n\u1e7d = \u2212100M the initial data on J \u2212 implied by the time\nreflection of the Stage I evolution was approximately 5\norders of magnitude smaller at K\u2212 than at its peak (at\n\u1e7d \u2248 0); and for \u1e7d = \u2212200M , the size at K\u2212 was 9 orders\nof magnitude smaller than at the peak. The Stage II\napproximation of smoothing this data to zero on K\u2212 violates the integral condition (4.12) and produces the early\ntime polynomial behavior shown in the plots of F\u03030 (\u0169) at\nI + in Fig. 3. For both locations of K\u2212 the early time\nbehavior is well fit by a 4th order polynomial but the\nsize of the polynomial is about 107 times larger for the\nfarther out location of K\u2212 .\nFigure 4 is a magnified view of Fig. 3 showing how the\nearly time quartic polynomial behavior contaminates the\ngenuine signal at later times.\nFigure 5 shows that the two signals agree after taking\nfour \u0169-derivatives.\nIn the second set of experiments, J \u2212 was located at\n\u0169 = \u2212540M , \u0169 = \u2212720M , \u0169 = \u22125090M , and \u0169 = \u2212\u221e,\n\nPSfrag replacements\nFIG. 3: Comparison of the behavior of F\u03030 for two locations\nof K\u2212 .\n\n40\nK\u2212 located at \u1e7d = \u2212100M\nK\u2212 located at \u1e7d = \u2212200M\n\n20\n\n0\n\nF\u03030\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221240\n\n\u221260\n\u2212100\n\n\u221250\n\n0\n\n50\n\n\u0169\n\nPSfrag replacements\nFIG. 4: Blowup of Fig. 3 in the region of the genuine signal.\n\nwith K\u2212 located at \u1e7d = \u2212100M (to accentuate the early\ntime polynomial behavior).

(4.2) and (4.7) reduce to\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u2202\u1e7d \u2212\n\u2202\u0169 f0 = 0,\n(4.15)\n2M\nwhere f0 = F\u03020 = 16M 4 F\u03060 . This equation admits outgoing waves of the form f0 = f (\u0169) exp(\u1e7d/(2M )) in the\nregion inside the Schwarzschild potential. These exponentially growing waves are forbidden in the analytic\nversion of our problem by the boundary condition that\nF\u03020 = F\u03060 = 0 on K\u2212 but they are excited by roundoff\nerror. As the computation proceeds, the interval \u2206\u1e7d between K\u2212 and the peak of the Schwarzschild potential increases and eventually round-off error in this interval undergoes sufficient exponential magnification to spoil the\nexterior evolution. There remains an inner region on H+\nwhere the solution is accurate. For both algorithms, doubling the precision at which the computation is carried\nout increases the meaningful computation time. For example, the double precision runs shown in Figs. 5 and\n8 end prematurely due to the onset of numerical noise\nbut in quadruple precision both runs can be extended\nthrough five or six cycles of quasinormal ringdown.\nV.\n\nCLOSE APPROXIMATION RETARDED\nWAVEFORMS\n\nWe begin with a review of the close approximation retarded waveforms from a white hole fission obtained in\nStage I [1]. The close approximation white hole horizon\nperturbation (F\u03034 |H\u2212 ) given by the conformal model is\na pulse with the following basic properties in terms of\nits dependence on the scale invariant parameter \u03b7 (see\nSec.II A). In the large \u03b7 limit (\u03b7 > 250) the amplitude\nof the pulse scales quadratically with \u03b7 and the width is\na monotonically decreasing function of \u03b7 (the width becomes zero as \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e). In the small \u03b7 limit (\u03b7 < 25)\nthe amplitude scales linearly with \u03b7 but the shape of the\npulse is independent of \u03b7. Fig. 9 shows the horizon data\nobtained from various large and mid-size values of \u03b7 (the\namplitudes have been renormalized so that all pulses have\nthe same height).\nThe associated retarded white hole fission waveforms\n(F\u03034 |I + ) have a similar dependence on \u03b7.

The\namplitude of the initial pulse scales quadratically with \u03b7\nand the width is a monotonically decreasing function of\n\u03b7. As \u03b7 is reduced, the initial pulse (signal prior to ringdown) becomes wider and obtains more structure. In the\nsmall \u03b7 limit the amplitude scales linearly with \u03b7 and the\nshape is independent of \u03b7.

The narrow peak corresponds to \u03b7 = 7060\nand \u03b7 = 1410.\n\nWe now present the results for the retarded solutions\nfrom a black hole fusion in the close approximation obtained by superposition of the advanced black hole results\n(time reversal of the above white hole solutions) and the\nStage II results. This superposition yields the retarded\nwaveform and a modified black hole horizon perturbation. In the following paragraph, we first describe the\nblack hole horizon perturbations.\nFigure 11 shows the perturbation on H+ for the retarded black hole solution. Unlike the Stage I perturbation of the white hole horizon (see Fig. 9), here the width\nof the perturbation is never smaller than a quasinormal\nperiod.\nThe superposition procedure for obtaining the Stage\nII perturbation of the black hole horizon turns the very\nsharp Stage I pulses associated with large \u03b7 into relatively broad pulses. The final black hole perturbation\napproaches a unique asymptotic shape in both the large\nand small \u03b7 limits. In Fig. 11, \u03b7 = 7060 and \u03b7 = 1410 give\nthe large \u03b7 shape, while \u03b7 = .00524 and \u03b7 = .00001 give\nthe same small \u03b7 shape. Note that the two extremes are\nthemselves very similar. Consequently all the retarded\nblack hole waveforms obtained from this procedure are\nvery similar in shape.\nOne of the most striking features of this new horizon perturbation is the initial ringup, which is later followed by the expected ringdown due to scattering off the\nSchwarzschild potential. The ringup on H+ results from\nthe ringup of the data on J \u2212 , which in turn results from\nthe ringdown of the Stage I waveform. This ringup is\n\nan unavoidable feature of our two stage methodology for\nremoving ingoing radiation from the black hole merger.\nFigure 12 shows the waveforms for close approximation data obtained from the conformal model. The amplitude of the waveforms scales linearly with \u03b7 and has\nbeen renormalized so that all waveforms show the same\nquasinormal decay at late times. Note that, aside from\namplitude, the waveforms have only weak dependence on\n\u03b7. This is a great departure from the stage I results that\nthe widths of the retarded white hole waveforms depend\nstrongly on \u03b7, which produces extremely narrow pulses\nfor large \u03b7.\nIt should not be surprising that retarded waveforms\nfrom a black hole merger differ qualitatively from retarded waveforms from a white hole fission. The fission\nprocess is directly observable at I + , whereas the merger\nwaveform results indirectly from the black holes through\nthe preceding collapse of matter or gravitational wave\nenergy that formed them. This also explains why the fission waveform should be more sensitive to the parameter\n\u03b7 which controls the shape and timescale of the horizon\ndata. However, the weakness of the dependence of the\nmerger waveform on \u03b7 is surprising.\nThe retarded black hole waveforms at I + also show\nthe ringup/ringdown pattern. The ringup is due to\nbackscatter of the ringup on the initial slice J \u2212 . Interestingly, the backscattered signal of an l = 2 quasinormal\nringup on J \u2212 is a ringup on I + with the same l = 2\ntime dependence. Figure 13 shows the ringup phase of\nthe waveform obtained by placing K\u2212 at \u1e7d = \u2212100M\nand at \u1e7d = \u2212200M . (The data for \u1e7d = \u2212200M contains more ringup cycles.) In the figure F\u03034 |I + is mul-\n\n\f13\nretarded waveform from a binary black hole merger in\nthe close approximation. The process of removing ingoing radiation from the system leads to two major new\nfeatures in the shape of the close approximation waveforms for a head-on collision: (i) an initial quasinormal\nringup and (ii) weak sensitivity to the parameter \u03b7 of the\nmodel that in some heuristic sense controls the collision\nvelocity. Feature (ii) has the potential importance of enabling the design of an efficient template for extracting a\ngravitational wave signal from noise.\n\nTruncated at \u1e7d = \u2212100M\n\nTruncated at \u1e7d = \u2212200M\n\n0.09\n\n\u22120.01\n\nSimilar attempts to remove ingoing radiation from\nCauchy evolutions of close approximation data have not\nyet been made. Such studies would help clarify whether\nthe above features are of intrinsic physical origin or an\nartifact of our methodology.\n\n\u22120.11\n\u2212250\n\nThe present work is part of an ongoing effort to carry\nout a similar two stage characteristic evolution to provide\nthe waveforms from coalescing black holes in the nonlinear regime. Because this is an unexplored area of binary\nblack hole physics, this perturbative study of the headon collision provides a preliminary physical check which\nwill be useful in extending the work to the nonlinear and\nnonaxisymmetric case, where inspiraling black holes can\nbe treated.\n\n\u2212200\n\n\u2212150\n\n\u2212100\n\n\u221250\n\n0\n\n\u0169\n\nbyreplacements\nFIG. 13: Ringup of the waveform: F\u03034 |I + multiplied PSfrag\nexp \u2212.08896\u0169/M\n\ntiplied by exp \u2212.08896\u0169 to remove the exponential part\nof the quasinormal time dependence.
