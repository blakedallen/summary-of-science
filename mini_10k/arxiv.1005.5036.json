A 12mm receiver was constructed for Mopra in 1996, primarily to support space VLBI observations with the\nHALCA satellite as part of the VLBI Space Observatory Programme (Hirabayashi et al. 2000). The compromised performance of the HALCA 12-mm receiver\n(Kobayashi et al. 2000) resulted in Mopra support for\nthe VSOP mission being at 1.6 and 4.9 GHz (e.g., Scott\net al. 2004; Dodson et al. 2008), however the \"VSOP\"\n12-mm receiver was used in a number of other Long\nBaseline Array VLBI observations (e.g., Greenhill et\nal. 2003) until it was replaced with an MMIC-based\nreceiver (Gough et al. 2004) in 2006.\nUnder an agreement between ATNF and the University of New South Wales (UNSW), UNSW funded\nthe replacement of the outer perforated panels of the\ndish in 1999 with solid panels, and the receiver optics were modified to illuminate the full 22 m. Several\nrounds of holography using a 30-GHz satellite beacon were used to reduce the surface RMS error from\n\nThe 22-m Mopra radio telescope is one element of\nthe Australia Telescope (Frater, Brooks & Whiteoak\n1992). The Mopra observatory is located near Coonabarabran, New South Wales, Australia. The telescope is located at a longitude of 149\u25e6 5\u2032 58\u2032\u2032 and a\nlatitude of 31\u25e6 16\u2032 58\u2032\u2032 and at an elevation of 866 metres above sea level.1\nConstruction of the wheel-on-track telescope (Cooper\net al. 1992) was completed in late 1991, with the first\nastronomical observations being made as part of a VLBI\nsession the following week and reported in Tingay et\nal. (1998). In its first years, Mopra was used for VLBI\nand single-dish observations at centimetre wavelengths\n(e.g., Koribalski, Johnston & Otrupcek 1994). In 1995,\nthe telescope was used together with the Parkes 64m telescope as part of Project Phoenix, which observed 209 solar-type stars over the frequency range\n1.2\u20133.0 GHz to search for possible narrow-band transmissions from extra-terrestrial life (Tarter 1997). The\nMopra 20/13 cm feed and receiver was modified from\nthe ATCA design to improve performance over the\nwider Project Phoenix range - changes which later\n1 See\nhttp://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/mopra/\nmore details.\n\nfor\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPublications of the Astronomical Society of Australia\n\n270 \u03bcm in 1999 to 180 \u03bcm in 2004. In 2004, observing\ncapabilities were enhanced with the addition of an onthe-fly mapping mode, enabling efficient mapping of\nlarger regions of interest. The 3-mm SIS receiver was\nthe main receiver used for single-dish observing during this period, with the telescope being characterised\nin the 3-mm band by Ladd et al. (2005). Following\nthe replacement of the 3-mm SIS receiver in 2005, and\nthe addition of a 12-mm receiver in 2006 and 7-mm\nreceiver (Moorey et al. 2008) in 2008, Mopra now has\na suite of three receivers for single-dish observations,\ncovering the frequency ranges 16\u201328, 30\u201350 and 76\u2013\n117 GHz. The receivers are cryogenically cooled Indium Phosphide (InP) High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMICs) low-noise amplifiers. The receiver systems do not require any manual tuning and include\nnoise diodes for system temperature determination,\nwith the 3 mm receiver also having a paddle for atmospheric attenuation (\u03c4 ) corrections. Physically, the\nthree receivers are mounted in a single dewar (Moorey\net al. 2008), with a short turret rotation required to\nchange between 12-mm and 3-mm observing frequencies. Changing to and from 7-mm observing requires\na physical translation of the dewar by about 10 cm,\nwhich takes several minutes.\nIn 2006, the Mopra Spectrometer (MOPS)2 , was\ninstalled as the main back-end for single-dish observing. MOPS is a broadband digital filter bank with\nfour overlapping sub-bands each with a bandwidth of\n2.2 GHz providing a total of 8.3 GHz of continuous\nbandwidth. The spectrometer can be used in two observing modes: wideband mode and zoom mode. The\nwideband mode provides 8.3 GHz of continuous coverage with a total of 32,384 spectral channels in each polarisation, providing a frequency resolution of 256 kHz\nper channel and a velocity resolution of 3.4, 1.7 and\n0.9 km s\u22121 at 22, 44 and 90 GHz, respectively. The second of these modes provides a total of 16 zoom windows - four of which can be placed in each of the\nfour sub-bands - each with 137 GHz of bandwidth\nand 4,096 spectral channels providing approximately\neight times higher frequency and velocity resolution\nthan the wideband mode.\nObservations at 3 mm are restricted to the winter\nmonths (May\u2013October) when the atmosphere is generally more stable and the amount of water vapour\nin the atmosphere is generally lower. However, observations at 12 and 7 mm are less affected by atmospheric fluctuations and water vapour content than at\n3 mm, and thus, can be scheduled through most of the\nyear. Therefore the installation of the 12- and 7-mm\nreceivers has significantly increased the potential science output of the telescope (e.g., Urquhart et al. 2009,\nWalsh et al. 2007, 2008).\nIn this paper we will present a combination of continuum and spectral-line observations of Jupiter and\nH2 O and SiO masers chosen to characterise the tele-\n\nscope's beam size, shape and efficiency between 16\u2013\n50 GHz. To maintain consistency across all three millimetre bands we have followed the procedures and\nanalyses used by Ladd et al. (2005) to characterise the\n3-mm system.\n\n2 MOPS was funded in part through a grant instigated\nby the University of New South Wales (UNSW) under the\nAustralian Research Council Grants scheme for Linkage, Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities (LIEF), and in part\nby CSIRO ATNF.\n\n2\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n\nThe observations were made between October and December 2009 and consisted of a combination of two orthogonal cross-scans, beam maps, and position-switched\nobservations. During all of these observations the pointing was checked, using the standard five-point procedure, approximately once an hour with corrections\nfound to be <10\u2032\u2032 . The focus was set to 16.7 mm since\nthis position was found to be optimum for both the 7and 12-mm observations. In the following subsections\nwe will describe the details of the various observational\nmodes used and their respective data reduction procedures. No opacity corrections were applied at 12 and\n7 mm as they are small at these frequencies (of order a\nfew percent at the frequencies and elevations of these\nobservations).\n\n2.1\n\nJupiter Observations\n\nA combination of cross-scans and beam maps were\nmade towards Jupiter in order to calculate the telescope's main beam size, shape and efficiency as a function of frequency. Planets are generally used for estimating telescope characteristics since their sizes and\nfluxes are fairly well modeled. For these observations\nwe chose Jupiter as it is relatively bright, and compact\nat the frequencies of interest (\u223c40\u2032\u2032 during the time\nof these observations), and its relative motion due to\nits orbital velocity is small - less than a tenth of a\nbeam during the time taken for each observation -\nand could therefore be neglected. Continuum observations have the advantage of allowing the beam parameters to be calculated as a function of frequency across\nthe whole 12 and 7 mm frequency range. These observations were made using the zoom mode with four\nwindows being placed in each 2 GHz sub-band; the four\nwindows were subsequently averaged together to provide a total bandwidth of \u223c500 MHz, across each subband.\nThe cross-scans were made through the centre of\nJupiter in the Right Ascension and Declination directions in order to determine the beam size. The crossscans consisted of a strip of seventeen points spaced at\napproximately one quarter beamwidths passing through\nthe centre of the planet. The contribution from the sky\nand telescope was estimated and removed by observing\nan off-source position at the beginning and end of each\nscan. To ensure the scans passed through the centre of\nthe planet the telescope pointing was checked immediately before each scan with the pointing model being\ncorrected as necessary.\nBeam maps were made of Jupiter to investigate\nhow the telescope beam shape and efficiency change\nas a function of frequency. To minimise the effects\n\n\f3\n\nwww.publish.csiro.au/journals/pasa\n\nof atmospheric attenuation due to water vapour these\nmapping observations were made at an elevation of\n\u223c70\u25e6 . The map sizes were approximately 9\u2032 \u00d7 9\u2032 and\n6\u2032 \u00d7 6\u2032 for the 12 and 7 mm observations respectively.\nThe mapping observations were produced using the\non-the-fly mode and consisted of 35 rows scanned in\nRight Ascension, with each scan separated in Declination by approximately one-quarter beam width (\u223c30\u2032\u2032\nand \u223c20\u2032\u2032 at 12 and 7 mm respectively), with an offsource reference position being observed before each\nrow. The position of Jupiter was updated at the beginning of each scan to compensate for its orbital motion.\nThe beam maps took \u223c20 minutes each to complete,\nwith the telescope pointing being checked before and\nafter each map.\nThe temperature scale for the planet observations\nis set by the noise calibration system, which must be\nstable and well-characterised. For the 7-mm band, the\nnoise source is a commercial unit, ELVA-1 model ISSN22, whereas for the 12-mm band the noise source was\nbuilt by the ATNF. The electronic drive circuitry necessary to ensure a stable and flat noise output spectrum is internal to the 7-mm band noise source, whereas\nthe 12-mm noise source is driven by an external constant current power supply. For both bands the units\nwere tested and characterised before being installed\nand found to be stable, essentially flat-spectrum noise\nsources. The noise diode outputs are introduced into\nthe signal path by waveguide couplers, which also make\na contribution to the overall performance. The typical\nperformance of the 7-mm couplers (installed both at\nMopra and the ATCA) is described by Moorey et al\n(2008). The 12-mm coupler has comparable characteristics, with some amplitude variability above 25 GHz.\n\n2.2\n\nH2 O and SiO Maser Beam Maps\n\nAlthough planets are the preferred astronomical sources\nfor determining beam efficiencies, their relatively low\nsignal to noise ratio (SNR), and the difficulty removing the sky emission due to atmospheric variations,\nmakes continuum observations less suitable for determining the telescope's beam pattern. A better choice\nis to make observations of strong astronomical masers\nwhich provide high SNR maps of the telescope beam\npatterns, primarily due to the better baseline subtraction. However, unlike continuum observations of\na planet, that can be made at all available frequencies to each receiver, observations of masers can only\nbe made at a few well defined frequencies, and consequently only provide information at these frequencies.\nWe have therefore made beam maps of the bright\nH2 O and SiO masers (at 22.24 and 43.12 GHz respectively) associated with Orion SiO. These two masers\nallow us to investigate the telescope beam pattern in\nboth the 12- and 7-mm bands. These maps are centred on the position of Orion SiO (\u03b1J 2000 = 5:35:14.5\nand \u03b4J 2000 = \u22126:22:29.6) and covered a 20\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032 and\na 10\u2032 \u00d7 10\u2032 region at 22.24 and 43.12 GHz, respectively.\nEach map consisted of a total of 25 on-source scans,\neach individual scan was separated by 51\u2032\u2032 and 26\u2032\u2032 for\nthe 22.24 and 43.12 GHz maps, respectively. Each map\nrequired approximately one hour to complete. Two\n\nmaps were produced for each maser frequency using\northogonal scan directions. These were subsequently\ncombined to reduce striping (which can result from\nfluctuations in the sky emission during the observations) and improve the signal to noise in the final map.\n\n2.3\n\nData Reduction\n\nThe cross-scans and position-switched observations\nwere reduced using the ATNF spectral analysis package (ASAP).3 Each cross-scan consisted of seventeen\nseparate measurements taken across the planet. For\neach point the average antenna temperature measurement is calculated across the zoom bands. The background antenna temperature obtained from the reference position is then subtracted to produce a plot of\nantenna temperature as a function of angular offset\nacross the planet (see example presented in Figure 1).\nThe beam maps were reduced using LIVEDATA\nand GRIDZILLA packages available from the ATNF.4\nLIVEDATA performs a bandpass calibration for each\nrow using the off-source data followed by fitting a\nuser-specified polynomial to the spectral baseline.\nGRIDZILLA grids the data to a user-specified weighting and beam parameter input. The data were\nweighted using the periodic Tsys measurements and a\ncell size of 0.25\u2032 and 0.15\u2032 was used to grid the 12- and\n7-mm data, respectively.\nA Gaussian smoothing kernel was used to produce\nthe beam maps with a FWHM and a radial cutoff of\n2\u2032 for the 12 mm data and 1\u2032 for the 7 mm data; these\nvalues were chosen to minimise smoothing and obtain\na resolution in the reduced maps similar to the native\nresolution of the telescope at the observed frequencies.\nHowever, tests show that the actual choice of the fullwidth at half maximum (FWHM) used for the smoothing does not have a significant affect on the results.\n\n3\n\nResults and Analysis\n\n3.1\n\nTelescope Main Beam Size\n\nTo measure the change in beam sizes as a function of\nfrequency the orthogonal cross-scans of Jupiter were\naveraged together and fitted with a Gaussian profile.\nIn Figure 1 we present an example of the temperature\nprofile obtained across the planet from the cross-scan\nobservations and the Gaussian fit to the data. The\nFWHM from the fit is a convolution of the actual beam\nsize and the disk of the planet. The angular size of\nJupiter during the observations was \u223c40\u2032\u2032 , corresponding to \u223c20% of the telescope beam size at 12 mm and\n60% at 7 mm.\nTo calculate the telescope beam size we need to deconvolve the observed FWHM and the planetary disk\nusing:\n\n\u03b8mb =\n\nr\u0010\n\n\u03b8o2 \u2212\n\nln2 2\n\u03b8\n,\n2 planet\n\n\u0011\n\n(1)\n\n3 http://www.atnf.csiro.au/computing/software/asap/.\n4 Both\nsoftware\npackages\nare\navailable\nfrom\nhttp://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/livedata.html.\n\n\f4\n\nPublications of the Astronomical Society of Australia\n\nFigure 1: Example of the Jupiter cross-scan results.

In Table 1 we present the deconvolved beam sizes and their associated 1\u03c3 error derived\nfrom the Gaussian fit.\nIn Figure 2 we show the FWHM telescope beam\nsizes as a function of frequency. In this plot the horizontal and vertical error bars indicate the frequency\nrange the measurement covers and the 1\u03c3 error the\nerror in the FWHM measurement. The larger fractional errors seen at lower frequencies is related to the\nincreased levels of beam-dilution, resulting in a lower\nSNR. Additionally, we also plot the theoretical beam\nsizes (solid red line) calculated assuming \u03b8 = \u03bb/D,\nwhere \u03b8 is measured in radians, \u03bb is the observed wavelength and D is the diameter of the telescope. Inspection of the derived and theoretical beams sizes reveals\na strong correlation with a correlation coefficient =\n0.90.\n\n3.2\n\nTelescope Beam Pattern\n\nTo determine the telescope beam pattern, maps of the\n43.12 GHz SiO and 22.24 GHz H2 O masers associated\nwith Orion KL were produced. In the upper and lower\nleft panels of Figure 3 we present the integrated emission maps of the H2 O and SiO masers respectively.\nThe reference position used for these mapping observations was offset by 1\u25e6 in declination from the map\ncentre, and therefore, these maps are sensitive to both\nthe inner and outer error beams. Inspection of these\nimages clearly reveals the telescope's main beam and\n\n\fwww.publish.csiro.au/journals/pasa\n\n5\n\nFigure 3: Left panels: Integrated 22-GHz (top) and 43-GHz (bottom) maps of the H2 O and SiO masers\nassociated with Orion KL. The 22- and 43-GHz maps cover a region of \u223c20\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032 and \u223c10\u2032\u00d7 10\u2032 respectively. These maps clearly show a central 'core' of emission associated with the telescopes main beam and\nboth the inner and outer error beams. Contours have been added to highlight the emission associated with\nthe error beams which have intensities of only a few percent of the main beam and are relatively weak.\nThe first contour starts at 9 and 10 K km s\u22121 for the 22- and 43-GHz maps, respectively, and increase in\nsteps determined by a power law of index 1.5. In the right panels we present azimuthally averaged beam\nprofiles corresponding to the integrated map presented to their left. For both the 22 and 43 GHz integrated\nmaps we plot the normalised intensity (top), the logarithm of the normalised intensity (middle), and the\nencircled power (bottom), as a function of radial offset in arcminutes. In addition to the data shown in\nred, we also plot the Airy profile expected from a fully illuminated 22-m aperture (black dashes) and the\nresults of a Gaussian fit to the central 'core' (dotted blue).\n\n\f6\n\nPublications of the Astronomical Society of Australia\n\nTable 2: Summary of radial beam pattern derived\nparameters.\nFrequency\n(GHz)\n22\n43\n\nBeam\nComponent\nMain\nInner\nOuter\nMain\nInner\nOuter\n\nAngular\nSize\n(\u2032 )\n0.0\u20132.8\n2.8\u20136.5\n6.5\u20139.5\n0.0\u20131.3\n1.3\u20133.2\n3.2\u20135.5\n\nEncircled\nPower\n(%)\n83\n13\n4\n77\n15\n8\n\nboth inner and outer error beams - contours have\nbeen added to emphasise the emission associated with\nthe outer error beam, which is significantly weaker\nthan the emission associated with the main beam. In\nthe upper and lower right panels of Figure 3 we present\nthe plots of the azimuthally averaged \u223c22 GHz and\n\u223c43 GHz radial beam profiles respectively (see figure\ncaption for a description of individual plots).\nInspection of both the H2 O and SiO maser integrated emission map shown in Figure 3 (left panels)\nreveals a central core and two weaker azimuthal components resulting from the telescope sidelobes. Following Ladd et al. (2005) we refer to these as the 'main\nbeam', 'inner error beam' and 'outer error beam'. All\nthree structures can be clearly distinguished and appear to be circular in shape. The azimuthally averaged\nradial plots presented in the right panels of Figure 3 of\nthe two maser transitions reveals similar patterns. The\ncentral 'core' emission in both sets of plots are well-fit\nwith Gaussians of FWHM 2.35\u2032 and 1.2\u2032 for the H2 O\nand SiO maser respectively. In both cases the main\nbeam sizes determined by the fit to the maser emission is approximately the same as determined using\nthe cross-scan data presented in Section 3.1. Comparing the expect Airy patterns with the data we see the\nmain beam and, inner and outer error beam for the\ntwo masers correspond well with the expected position and intensity ratios of the first, second and fourth\ncomponents of the Airy pattern. However, there is no\ncounterpart in either sets of data that would correspond with the position of the third Airy component,\nand it is unclear what might be responsible for the\nsuppression of this particular sidelobe.\nMeasuring the total encircled power within the main\nbeam at 22 GHz and 43 GHz we find values of \u223c83%\nand \u223c77% respectively, which is marginally better than\nthe 75% reported by Ladd et al. (2005) in their analysis of the telescope's 3 mm beam pattern. However,\nthis means that the error beams can make a significant\ncontribution to the measured flux for extended sources\nand need to be taken into account when estimating the\nbeam efficiency (this will be discussed in more detail\nin Section 3.3.2). In Table 2 we present a summary of\nthe angular extent and the total power encircled in the\nmain, and inner and outer error beams.\n\n3.3\n\nBeam Efficiency\n\nIn Figures 4 and 5 we present the results of our beam\nmapping observations of Jupiter. The emission maps\nnicely illustrate the circular shape and the decrease of\nthe telescope's FWHM beam size with increasing frequency, as expected. We note that in a number of the\nmaps the position of the planet is offset from the pointing centre (0,0), which is the result of pointing errors.\nThese are bigger than would normally be expected\ndue to the large angular distance of the planet from\nthe Galactic Plane during the observations, and consequently, the large angular distances between Jupiter\nand the nearest available pointing sources.\nAs we have seen in the previous section the radial\nbeam profile at both 12 and 7 mm consists of three distinct components. The presence of these error beams\nsomewhat complicates the calibration for sources with\nangular diameters larger than about twice the telescope's main beam. A consequence of this is that the\ntelescope efficiency will depend on the angular size of\nthe observed source. Following the lead of Ladd et al.\n(2005), we separate the calibration into two parts to\naccommodate both compact and extended sources.\n\n3.3.1\n\nMain Beam Efficiency\n\nPlanets are ideal astronomical sources to use for deriving beam efficiencies as their sizes and fluxes are well\nknown. Moreover, given that Jupiter is unresolved at\nall frequencies of interest for this study it couples well\nwith the telescope's main beam but not to either of\nthe two error beams. In this cases the measured antenna temperature, TA\u2217 , is a convolution of the sources\nbrightness temperature distribution, TB (\u03b8, \u03c6), with the\ntelescope beam pattern, Pn (\u03b8, \u03c6), such that:\nTA\u2217\n\n=\n\nR\n\nTB (\u03b8, \u03c6)Pn (\u03b8, \u03c6) d\u03a9\n\nR\n\n4\u03c0\n\nPn (\u03b8, \u03c6) d\u03a9\n\n(2)\n\nFor compact sources with a uniform brightness temperature the equation above simplifies to:\n\nTA\u2217\n\nR\n\nP (\u03b8, \u03c6) d\u03a9\n\u03a9planet\nplanet n\nTB = \u03b7mb\n= \u03b7mb R\nTB (3)\n\u03a9mb\nP\n(\u03b8,\n\u03c6)\nd\u03a9\nn\nmb\n\nwhere \u03a9planet is the solid angle of the planet at the\ntime of the observations, and \u03a9mb is the telescope main\nbeam solid angle. \u03b7mb is referred to as the main beam\nefficiency and is defined as the ratio of the total measured power within the telescope's main beam, and\ntotal measured power integrated over the full sphere\nof 4\u03c0, i.e.:\n\u03b7mb\n\nR\nPn (\u03b8, \u03c6) d\u03a9\n= Rmb\n4\u03c0\n\nPn (\u03b8, \u03c6) d\u03a9\n\n(4)\n\nThe ratio of planetary and main beam solid angles\nshown in the right hand side of Equation 3 consists of\ntwo important correction factors: beam dilution, f ,\nwhich reduces the expected antenna temperature -\nthis can be large if the angular size of the main beam\nis much larger than angular size of the planet; and\n\n\f7\n\nwww.publish.csiro.au/journals/pasa\n\nFigure 4: Maps of the telescope beam produced from observations of Jupiter using the 12 mm receiver.\nEach map covers a 2 GHz frequency window and is separated by 2 GHz interval through the 16\u201328 GHz\nfrequency range of the 12-mm receiver.

The derived values of K and f and\nthe angular size of the planet at the time of the various\nobservations are presented in Columns 3, 4 and 5 of\nTable 3, respectively.\n\nThe frequency-dependent brightness temperature\nof Jupiter is derived from the model of de Pater\n& Massie (1985), which gives the physical temperature, Tphys . The planet's brightness temperature is\nobtained by applying the Rayleigh-Jeans correction:\n- the planets physical temperature\nTB = Tphys \u2212 h\u03bd\n2k\nand Rayleigh-Jeans correction are given in this form\nin Column 6 in Table 3. The correction is \u223c0.5 and\n1 K for the 12- and 7-mm receiver ranges respectively.\nThis model has been adopted because it yields brightness temperatures at all frequencies and is also used\nfor calibration at the Australia Telescope Compact Array. The model is quite consistent with recent broadband measurements of the brightness temperature of\nJupiter: 152\u00b15 K at 32 GHz (6 GHz bandwidth, Mason et al. 1999); 134\u00b14, 146.6\u00b12.0, and 154.7\u00b11.7 K\nat 23, 33, and 41 GHz, respectively (Page et al. 2003).\nJupiter's brightness temperature, the beam dilution\nand coupling coefficient together yield the expected antenna temperature, TA\u2217\u2032 , assuming a perfect dish and\nloss-less front and backends, i.e.;\n\nTA\u2217\u2032 =\n\nTB\nfK\n\n(7)\n\n\f8\n\nPublications of the Astronomical Society of Australia\n\nTable 3: Summary of measured antenna temperatures, correction factors and beam efficiencies as a\nfunction of frequency.

Compact sources couple to the main beam only. However,\nextended sources (larger than \u223c2.8\u2032 and 1.6\u2032 at 12- and\n7-mm respectively) can couple to the inner and outer\nerror beams as well, making the calibration more complicated.

(2005) we have no direct measurements of extended sources, however, we\ncan use the radial beam patterns obtained from the\nmaser beam maps presented in Figure 3 to estimate\nthe extended beam efficiency. Referring to Table 2, we\nestimate the amount of power within the inner and\nouter error beams is approximately 20% and 24% of\nthat found in the main beam at 22 and 43 GHz, respectively. These values would be reduced to 15% at\nboth frequencies if the source couples to the main beam\nand the inner error beam only. Using our knowledge\nof the radial beam pattern we estimate the fraction of\nthe total power contained within the extended beam is\n\u223c60\u201375% for the 12-mm receiver range and \u223c65% for\nthe 7-mm receiver. We present the values of the extended beam efficiency in the final column of Table 3\nand are also shown on Figure 6 (blue line).\n\n4\n\nSummary\n\nWe present the results of a set of mapping and pointed\nobservations towards astronomical masers and Jupiter\nchosen to characterise the performance of the Mopra\nRadio Telescope at 12 and 7 mm. We calculate the\ntelescope's main beam size and efficiencies over the\n16\u201350 GHz frequency range. We find that the beam\nsize is well fit by \u03bb/D over the frequency range with a\ncorrelation coefficient of \u223c90%. Telescope main beam\nefficiencies for the 12-mm receiver range between \u223c48\u2013\n64%, with the 7-mm receiver having a beam efficiency\nof \u223c50% over the majority of the band.\nUsing beam maps of strong H2 O and SiO masers\nwe investigate the telescope's radial beam pattern. At\nboth frequencies the radial beam pattern reveals the\npresence of three components, a central 'core', which\nis well fit by a Gaussian and constitutes the telescope\nmain beam, and inner and outer error beams. At both\nfrequencies the inner and outer error beams extend\nout to approximately 2 and 3.4 times the full-width\nhalf maximum of the main beam respectively. From\nmeasurements of the radial beam power pattern we\nestimate the amount of power contained in the inner\nand outer error beams is 20% at 22 GHz rising to 30%\nat 43 GHz. Sources with angular sizes a factor of two\nor more larger than the telescopes main beam will couple to the main and error beams, and thus, the power\ncontributed by the error beams needs to be considered.\nWe therefore also provide an estimate of the extended\nbeam efficiencies.\n\n\f10\n\nPublications of the Astronomical Society of Australia\n\nSince the characterisation of this telescope is\nan ongoing process it is conceivable that some of\nthese results may change in future due to adjustments of the focus or subreflector. Moreover, as\nmentioned earlier, due to limited observing time\ndependence of the results presented here have not\nbeen fully tested as a function of elevation or azimuth. We have therefore set up the following web\npage which will be periodically updated as new\ndata becomes available and our calibration is refined:\nwww.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/mopra/calibration/mopracalib.html.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank the staff of the Paul\nWild Observatory for their assistance during the preparation of our observations.
