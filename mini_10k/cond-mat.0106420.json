By the quantum Monte Carlo method, we calculate a momentum-resolved charge compressibility \u03ba(k) = dhn(k)i/d\u03bc, which shows effects of an infinitesimal doping. At the temperature\nT \u223c t2 /U , \u03ba(k) shows peak structure at the (\u00b1\u03c0/2, \u00b1\u03c0/2) points along the |kx | + |ky | = \u03c0 line. A\nsimilar peak structure is reproduced in the mean-filed calculation for the d-wave pairing state or the\nstaggered flux state.\nPACS numbers: 71.10.Fd, 71.10.Pm, 71.27.+a, 79.60.-i\n\nEffects of electron-electron interaction have attracted\nlots of interest. One of the most significant phenomena in the strongly correlated electron system is the\nMott transition, which is a quantum phase transition\ndriven by the interaction. This Mott insulator has a\nfinite charge gap and the anitiferromagnetism often accompanies. Recently, various anomalous properties have\nbeen found near the Mott transition. Especially, there\nhas been a proposal that the interaction brings about\nanisotropy in the low energy excitations. For example, the spectral weight of the two-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel has been investigated1,2,3,4 . In addition, the deformation of the Fermi surface due to the interaction\noccurs in the t \u2212 J model5,6 . The singular momentum\ndependence is also observed experimentally. Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements suggest anisotropic properties in the low energy\nexcitations7 . These anomalous properties are widely observed in the strongly correlated electron system and they\ncould be an evidence of the non-Fermi liquid behavior.\nIt is thus an important and appealing topic to study the\nlow energy excitations with momentum resolution.\nThe anisotropy in the low energy excitations is natural, if we assume the d-wave pairing state or the flux\nstate8 . They both have a singular energy dispersion that\nhas gap nodes along the diagonal directions |kx | = |ky |,\nwhile a gap opens around the (\u00b1\u03c0, 0) and (0, \u00b1\u03c0) points.\nThus, one expects anisotropic charge excitations near the\nFermi surface. In general, however, these states compete\nwith other instabilities. Especially, at a rational filling,\nthe system often belongs to the antiferromagnetic Mott\ninsulator, where the charge degree of freedom is frozen.\nIn that case, the N\u00e9el state well describes the ground\nstate. Nevertheless, the d-wave pairing state or the flux\nstate can give a sound basis for the interpretation of some\nsingular phenomena near the Mott insulator at a finite\ntemperature.\nIn this letter, we investigate the charge fluctuation\nin the half-filled Hubbard model on a two-dimensional\nsquare lattice. Using the quantum Monte Carlo method,\nwe calculate the momentum-resolved charge compress-\n\nibility\n\u03ba(k) =\n\ndhn(k)i\n,\nd\u03bc\n\nwhere hn(k)i = hc\u2020k ck i denotes the momentum distribution function and \u03bc the chemical potential. The integralR of \u03ba(k) is equal to the charge compressibility\n\u03ba = dk\u03ba(k). If system has a finite charge gap, the\ncharge compressibility decreases exponentially towards\nzero as a temperature is lowered. Thus, at half filling,\nwe cannot calculate \u03ba(k) with sufficient numerical accuracy at a very low temperature. At a finite temperature, an infinitesimal shift of \u03bc causes an infinitesimal\ndoping. This means \u03ba(k) reflects the distribution of infinitesimally doped carriers with momentum resolution\n\u03b4n(k) \u2248 \u03ba(k)\u03b4\u03bc. Without the interaction, \u03ba(k) is peaked\non the Fermi surface and its value is constant. At half\nfilling, this non-interacting Fermi surface is a square in\nthe Brillouin zone, |kx | + |ky | = \u03c0. We define the Fermi\nsurface(FS) as this square in this paper.\nWe calculate \u03ba(k) at half filling. Here the charge\ndegree of freedom is almost frozen and the system is\ndominated only by the insulating fixed point (antiferromagnetic Mott insulator) at the low temperature(T \u226a\nt2 /U ).\nOn the other hand, at a sufficiently high\ntemperature(T \u226b U ), the Coulomb interaction U is irrelevant. We focus on the intermediate temperature region\n(T \u223c t2 /U ), expecting an interaction between charge and\nspin degree of freedom gives non-trivial feature on \u03ba(k)\neven at half-filling.\nThe Hamiltonian of the two-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel is given by\n\u0011\nX \u0010 \u2020\nci\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + c\u2020j\u03c3 ci\u03c3\nH=\u2212t\nhi,ji,\u03c3\n\n+U\n\nX\ni\n\n(ni\u2191 \u2212 1/2) (ni\u2193 \u2212 1/2) \u2212 \u03bc\n\nX\n\nni\u03c3 ,\n\ni,\u03c3\n\nwhere hi, ji denotes the nearest-neighbor links, and t the\nnearest-neighbor hopping amplitude. The system is on\na square lattice and we impose periodic boundary conditions.\n\n\f2\nIn order to obtain approximation-free results, we\nemploy the finite temperature auxiliary field quantum\nMonte Carlo (QMC) method9,10,11 . In this method,\nphysical observables are evaluated in the grand canonical ensemble. This makes it possible to obtain \u03ba(k) by\ndirect sampling in the QMC simulations as\n!\nX\nX\n\u03ba(k) = \u03b2 hn(k)\nn(k)i \u2212 hn(k)ih\nn(k)i ,\nk\n\nk\n\nwhere \u03b2 denotes an inverse temperature. If we calculate \u03ba(k) by numerically differentiating the QMC data\nhn(k)i, we need to perform simulations for the doped\nsystem. This brings about the notorious sign problem,\nwhich prevents us from getting reliable data. On the\nother hand, the direct evaluation of \u03ba(k) only needs a\nsimulation at half filling, where the sign problem does\nnot occur due to the particle-hole symmetry. The number of the electrons is not fixed at half filling in the QMC\nensembles, even if we set the chemical potential \u03bc = 0.\nThus, the information on infinitesimally doped systems\nis statistically taken into account in \u03ba(k).\nThe simulations were performed on a 16 \u00d7 16 square\nlattice. The finite size effects on \u03ba(k) are not observed\nwith this lattice size at the temperatures we have studied.\nThe Trotter time slice size is set to be \u2206\u03c4 \u2243 0.1/t. We\nhave checked that the systematic error due to the Trotter\ndecomposition does not change qualitative features. For\nthe interacting case, the strength of the interaction is set\nto be U/t = 4, where the charge gap is Eg \u2243 0.6t12 .\nWe have typically performed 500 Monte Carlo sweeps in\norder to reach a thermal equilibrium followed by \u223c 104\nmeasurement sweeps. The measurements are divided into\n10 blocks and the statistical error is estimated by the\nvariance among the blocks.\nAt first, let us discuss results at the temperature\nT \u223c t2 /U . The results of \u03ba(k) for U/t = 0 and U/t = 4\nare shown in Fig. 1. For the non-interacting case, the\nvalue of \u03ba(k) on the FS is constant. On the other hand,\nfor U/t = 4, peak structure emerges in \u03ba(k) at the\n(\u00b1\u03c0/2,\u00b1\u03c0/2) points. It indicates that the (\u00b1\u03c0/2,\u00b1\u03c0/2)\npoints are more sensitive to the shift of the chemical potential than (\u00b1\u03c0,0) or (0, \u00b1\u03c0). In other words, the system is more compressible at the (\u00b1\u03c0/2, \u00b1\u03c0/2) points.\nHere we note that the interaction does not change the\nline defined by hn(k)i = 0.5, which is identical with the\nFS in the non-interacting case. In that sense, the shape\nof the Fermi surface itself is not deformed at half filling13 .\nNext, we discuss the temperature dependence of \u03ba(k).\nThe results of \u03ba(k) for U/t = 4 at several temperatures are provided in Fig. 2. The peak structure at the\n(\u00b1\u03c0/2, \u00b1\u03c0/2) points is clearly observed at T \u223c t2 /U .\nIt becomes ambiguous as the temperature increases and\nvanishes above T \u223c U . Here we note that the antiferromagnetic correlation length is smaller than the linear\nsystem size at these temperatures (T /t \u2265 0.2). There are\ntwo known characteristic energy scales in the Hubbard\nmodel. One is the Coulomb interaction U and the other\n\nis the effective superexchange interaction J \u223c t2 /U . Our\nresults show the peak structure in \u03ba(k) emerges at the\ntemperature T \u223c J and vanishes at T > U .\nIn the half-filled Hubbard model, an antiferromagnetic\nlong-range order appears at T = 0. At a finite temperature, the system does not have any long-range order. Then there is no a priori reason to expect such\nan anisotropy in the charge compressibility. Thus, let\nus compare the QMC results with various mean-field solutions at the temperature T \u223c J. We focus on three\npossible mean-field solutions; the N\u00e9el state, the d-wave\npairing state, and the staggered flux state. As an effective model of the Hubbard model14 , we use the following\nt \u2212 J model to compare with our QMC results\nX \u2020\n(cj\u03c3 ck\u03c3 + c\u2020k\u03c3 cj\u03c3 )\nH=\u2212t\nhj,ki,\u03c3\n\n+J\n\n\u0013\nX\nX\u0012\n1\nni\u03c3 ,\nS j * S k \u2212 nj nk \u2212 \u03bc\n4\ni,\u03c3\n\nhj,ki\n\nP\nwhere Si = 21 \u03c3,\u03c3\u2032 c\u2020i\u03c3 \u03c3\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 ci\u03c3\u2032 and the double occupancy at the same site is prohibited. We take order parameters as\nJ\nh(cj\u2191 ck\u2193 \u2212 cj\u2193 ck\u2191 )i\n2\n\u0011\nJ \u0010\n\u03c7jk = h cj\u2191 c\u2020k\u2191 + cj\u2193 c\u2020k\u2193 i\n2\nmj = JhSjz i\n\n\u2206jk =\n\n(d-wave pairing),\n(staggered flux),\n(N\u00e9el).\n\nWe set \u2206jk to have the d-wave symmetry and its amplitude is constant \u2206. The link order \u03c7jk is chosen so\nthat the effective magnetic flux for each plaquette takes\n\u03c6 or \u2212\u03c6 alternately. The parameters satisfy \u2206/t < 1 or\n\u03c6 < \u03c0 where the low-lying excitations are described by\nanisotropic Dirac fermions15 . The staggered magnetization mj is (\u22121)jx +jy m. In order to apply the mean-field\nansatz, we introduce auxiliary fields to decouple the superexchange term and incorporate the constraints of no\ndouble occupancy. Next, we apply the saddle-point approximation and neglect the fluctuation around it by taking order parameters as an input parameter (without self\nconsistency condition). In low dimensions, the fluctuations generally play a role of destructing the long-range\norder and it is natural to expect it in our case. Our focus\nis, however, not on such a long-distance behavior.\nWe show \u03ba(k) at half filling for these mean-field states\nin Fig. 3. The peak structure at the (\u00b1\u03c0/2,\u00b1\u03c0/2) points\nis observed in the d-wave pairing or the staggered flux\nstate, which is similar to the QMC results. This implies\nthe d-wave pairing state or the staggered flux state competes with the N\u00e9el order at a finite temperature and\nthey give a good description of the short-distance behavior. However, we don't claim that these mean-filed\nstates become long-range ordered at half filling.Our interest is in which type of the order parameter can give\nthe anisotropy in the charge compressibility at T \u223c J.\nEven if these mean-filed states are unstable, they can\n\n\f3\nstill play an important role at a finite temperature. On\nthe other hand, \u03ba(k) of the N\u00e9el state gives a constant\nvalue on the FS, which does not reproduce the QMC results. The ground state of the half-filled system is well\ndescribed by the N\u00e9el state, while the system behaves\nessentially as a non-interacting case at a sufficiently high\ntemperature (T \u226b U ). Both the N\u00e9el state and the noninteracting metallic state give a constant \u03ba(k) on the FS.\nTherefore, one of the natural scenarios for the anisotropy\nin \u03ba(k) is that different kinds of fixed points exist and\nbring about some singular phenomena at an intermediate\ntemperature. Finally, we note that a possible admixture\nof different orders may happen at a low temperature.\nIn summary, we have investigated the charge fluctuation in the two-dimensional Hubbard model by the\nquantum Monte Carlo method. The momentum-resolved\ncharge compressibility \u03ba(k) is focused on at a finite temperature. It gives information on the infinitesimal doping in the Mott insulator. The peak structure at the\n(\u00b1\u03c0/2,\u00b1\u03c0/2) points is observed in \u03ba(k) at the temper-\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nElectronic address: otsuka@pothos.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp\nN.

It is qualitatively consistent with the\ncalculation for the d-wave pairing state or the staggered\nflux state, while the low temperature(T \u226a t2 /U ) behavior is dominated by the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator.\nThis peak structure disappears at the high temperature\nT > U where the Coulomb interaction is irrelevant.
