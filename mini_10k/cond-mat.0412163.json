Nevertheless, some 70% of new\nproducts put in the market fails. In marketing science the adoption of new technologies is\ntraditionally studied using the Bass model [1], which was first posed in 1969, and which\nrelates the fraction of consumers adopting a new technology per unit of time, to the fraction\npresent at that time. This model ignores the variation among consumers and it ignores their\nnetwork of social relations. One important recent insight in the description of human\neconomic behaviour is that these networks may be very important for the success or failure\nof new products. Arthur [2] argued that the amount of information humans typically have deal\nwith is too large to handle, and moreover individuals usually have to base their decisions on\npartial information. Therefore they turn to rules of thumb, or strategies, to determine their\nactions. These strategies are often just copied from peers; this is the first reason why social\nnetworks are important.\nThe second reason why networks are important, is that part of the perceived value (or utility)\nof a product depends on its acceptance in the social network of the consumer. The utility of a\nproduct represents more than its direct application; its value in use can be increased\nbecause the consumer feels that it attributes to his/her social status [3]. For example,\nclothing can be valuable to express the membership of a peer-group, or otherwise expensive\ncars may cue status to the peer-group. This social effect is not limited to products like cars,\nbut may also hold for commodity markets.\nRecently Stauffer [4], Weisbuch and Solomon have studied the impact of social networks\nand percolation phenomena to the adoption of new products. Solomon et al. [5] discuss the\npossibility of observing self-organised criticality. The question addressed is: why does one\nobserve that some newly launched products are doomed to failure while others become\ngreat hits, rather than a featureless distribution of partial success? The general explanation\nfor such a bimodal distribution is discussed in terms of bounded rationality. Decisions are not\ntaken upon complete information, but consumers copy the behaviour of their peers [6]. Thus,\nthe spread of a new technology is often compared to the spread of a virus over the\npopulation, and is determined by a percolation transition. Goldenberg et al. [7] bring these\nideas further and compare them to marketing of consumer goods, namely the introduction of\ncars and LCD color television sets.\nHowever, the models mentioned are all based on theoretical ideas of how consumers\nchoose, the link to empirical data is weak or missing. Before attempting to describe the\n\n2\n\n\fRD Groot, L\u00e9vy distribution and long correlation times in supermarket sales\ndynamics of new market introductions, one should at least be able to describe the dynamics\nof a stationary market. The first step to develop a realistic model of the collective behaviour\nof consumers, which takes into account psychological and social factors, should be to collect\nempirical facts that can be used as a standard to test the models. The development of\nmodels for financial and stock markets has benefited greatly from the analysis of price\nfluctuations [8,9]. Since this was the case for our understanding of stock markets, the\nobvious first step towards building a model of consumer sales, is to analyse the fluctuations\nin this market. This should unearth the empirical \u2013 stylised \u2013 facts of consumer sales. Such\nan analysis seems to be missing in this field. Once the stylised facts are established we can\nanalyse their causes, and finally build models based on these insights. As a first attempt in\nthis direction the fluctuations in actual sales data of a number of consumer goods are\nanalysed. Here we restrict to presenting the empirical data and its implications for modelling.\n\n2 The consumer goods market\nThe available observations are actual sales data of products in supermarkets. Time series of\nsales can be obtained from ACNielsen [10]. The longest series available is over a period of\n120 weeks. As an example of sales in a commodity market, the sales data of ketchup in the\nNetherlands will be discussed first. In the Netherlands there are about 16x106 consumers,\ndivided over some 7x106 households. These households shop at some 5200 supermarkets.\nThe raw sales data for Calv\u00e9, Gouda's Glorie, Heinz and Remia are shown in Figure 1a.\nMost of the noise in the sales data shown in Figure 1a can be attributed to promotional\nactions. ACNielsen also provides a baseline for the sales of each product, which is the total\nsales not conducted under promotion. For the shops where a promotion is on, baseline sales\nfrom the previous eight weeks are used to extrapolate to the value one would have had if\nthere would not have been a promotion in that week. Basically it comes down to subtracting\nthe excess sales that is attributed to promotion. The output of this analysis is known as the\nbaseline sales. The noise in the baseline sales is shown in Figure 1b, this is the underlying\nfluctuation of the market.\nThe principal parameter to characterise the sales data is the market share of the various\nbrands. In this case these are 52.7%, 19.6%, 14.8% and 12.9% respectively in order of size.\nAs a first method of analysis the baseline sales data in Figure 1b were fitted to parabolas,\nand the variations from the trends were studied. The root mean square fluctuations thus\nfound vary from 7.6% of sales for the product of highest market share to 13.2% of sales for\nthe product of lowest market share.\n\n3\n\n\fRD Groot, L\u00e9vy distribution and long correlation times in supermarket sales\nThe relative noise is an indication of the number of uncorrelated sales events. If we have N\nindependent events the relative noise is given by 1/\u221aN. Hence, from the relative noise in\nsales we find in turn the number of independent sales events. The remarkable result is that\nout of 37000 bottles of Heinz ketchup sold per week, apparently only 173 events are\nindependent, and out of 9000 bottles of Remia sold per week only 57 events are\nuncorrelated. This difference cannot be explained on the basis of the size of the sample\ntaken by ACNielsen. The sample is allegedly based on some 1100 shops (out of 5161),\nwhich represents 40% of all sales in the Netherlands; the statistical variation is estimated as\n2% [11]. Nor can it be explained by assuming that the data reflects sales to the retailer in\nlarger quantities. The data is actual point of sales data to the consumer [11]. Even if we\nassume that the number of 1100 shops is overstated (some say that the size of the sample\nis only 350 shops) then still the noise level does not fit the number of independent buying\nevents.\nHence, merely by studying the variance in baseline sales fluctuations we arrive at the\nconclusion that the buying behaviour of thousands of consumers is correlated. Whereas this\nmay be an obvious social effect for fashionable products like cloths, it is less obvious why\nthis would be the case for a commodity like ketchup. Therefore we will study the data in\nmore detail in the next sections to obtain the noise spectrum and correlation functions.\n\n3 The Noise Distribution\nTo analyse the data set further, the noise distribution of sales is studied. Mantegna and\nStanley introduced a method to analyse the fluctuations in the S&P 500 index of stock\nmarkets, by studying the price difference of a stock at two successive points in time (the\nprice return) [8]. In stock markets, this time difference can be as small as one minute, but it\ncan also be days. They found that the distribution of price differences follows a characteristic\nshape, the L\u00e9vy distribution. The width of the distribution obviously depends on the time\ninterval studied, but the shape of the distribution remains the same. For stock markets it is\ngiven by\n\nP ( x) =\n\n1\n\n\u03c0\u222b\n\n\u221e\n0\n\nexp(\u2212\u03b3q \u03b1 ) cos(qx) dq\n\n1\n\nwhere \u03b1 takes on the value \u03b1 = 1.4 in real markets. For \u03b1 = 2 this equation generates a\nGaussian distribution, but for the lower value \u03b1 = 1.4 pertinent to the market, the distribution\nhas fat tails. For large values of the price return the distribution crosses over to a\ncharacteristic power law with \u03b1 = 3, thus following a truncated L\u00e9vy distribution [12,13].\n\n4\n\n\fRD Groot, L\u00e9vy distribution and long correlation times in supermarket sales\nFor ketchup sales data we can use the same method of analysis; the distribution of the\nchange of sales from one week to the next is studied, i.e. the distribution of\n\u2206s(t) = s(t+1) \u2212 s(t). Because we have only limited data, the mean value of \u2206s was first\ndetermined for each series, which was subsequently subtracted from the data. Next the\nspread in \u2206s was determined, and \u2206s was normalised to its spread for each series. This\ngives four series of zero mean and spread one, with a total of 468 observations (some data\npoints corresponding to Xmas sales were removed). For this data set a distribution has been\ndetermined, which is shown in Figure 2.\nThis figure shows that the distribution of sales fluctuations is not a Gaussian distribution. In\nfact the L\u00e9vy distribution taken at the power \u03b1 = 1.4 seen in stock markets [8] makes a very\ngood fit to the ketchup data, whereas the Gaussian distribution of the same width makes a\npoor fit. The remarkable take out is that for the ketchup market, daily supermarket sales\ncorrected for promotional actions, follows roughly the pattern of price return fluctuations of\nstock markets. This suggests a similar underlying cause. Naively one would expect a\nGaussian distribution, as the sales are the result of many independent buying events. When\na distribution is not Gaussian, this implies that there are strong correlations in the signal. In\nother words, the buying events are not independent.\nOne may wonder if the effect shown here is an artefact, caused by the procedure followed\nby ACNielsen to obtain the baseline. This is not the case. If we simply subtract all sales in\nshops where promotional actions are on and then study the fluctuations, we find the same\ndistribution. Further, one may wonder if the broad noise spectrum may be a remnant of\npromotional sales. Perhaps a small residual error in subtracting the promotional sales has\nled to the L\u00e9vy noise. If this would be the case the effect should disappear when we take out\nall high frequency modes, since the promotions are spiky one-week events. To this end the\ndata was Fourier transformed, and all modes of frequency \u03c9 > 1 were removed from the\nsales data (i.e. all frequencies with a period smaller than 6.3 weeks are taken away). The\nback-transform for each brand is now a smooth curve running through the baseline sales.\nWhen a distribution of sales differences from one week to the next is calculated from this\nsmooth curve and scaled relative to the noise amplitude, we find again a L\u00e9vy distribution\n(see Figure 3), and within the statistical accuracy this is indistinguishable from the previous\ndistribution. This shows that the broad distribution and its fat tails are not caused by high\nfrequency noise, since everything with a period less than 6 weeks has been taken away.\nThis implies that the shape of this distribution is not caused by promotions, not caused by\nweather variations and not caused by isolated sale bursts at bank holidays.\n\n5\n\n\fRD Groot, L\u00e9vy distribution and long correlation times in supermarket sales\n\nFinally, if this effect is no coincidence, one should be able to reproduce it for other markets.\nProducts deemed to be similar to ketchup are mayonnaise and curry sauce, in that they are\nall sauces, and not bought very frequently. We studied the baseline sales of Calv\u00e9, Gouda's\nGlorie and Remia mayonnaise, and of Calv\u00e9, Gouda's Glorie, Hela, Heinz, Remia and AO\ncurry sauce over the same time interval as the ketchup data. Baseline sales in these\nmarkets indeed look as noisy as that of ketchup.\nFor the mayonnaise and curry baseline sales data, again the weekly sales differences were\ndetermined. For each brand and product, the sales differences were then normalised to the\nmean spread over the 118 week period (again Xmas 2000 sales was excluded from the\nstatistics). When the mayonnaise and curry sauce markets are studied separately the same\ndistribution is obtained as for ketchup. All three markets are therefore statistically the same\nas far as the noise distribution is concerned. Because each data series is normalised to unit\nvariance, all ketchup, mayonnaise and curry data can be collected into one distribution. This\ndistribution matches the L\u00e9vy distribution close to exactly, see Figure 4. Again, the L\u00e9vy\nexponent 1.4 \u2013 copied from financial markets \u2013 fits the data.\n\n4 Correlation functions\nOne may argue that the shape of the distribution and the high noise level could be caused\nby a cross correlation effect between promotions of one brand and the sales of another. The\nidea behind this is that baseline sales data of a brand has been corrected for promotions of\nthat same brand, but not for promotions of other brands. If brand 1 has a promotion leading\nto sales increase of brand 1, then brands 2, 3 and 4 might suffer as a result. Thus, one might\nexpect a negative cross correlation between the sales of one brand and the baseline sales of\nanother. If this is true, the noise level observed in the previous section may not be caused by\nthe dynamics of the market, but could still be a remnant of promotion effects. To check this\nhypothesis the auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions were studied.\nIf the weekly sales of brand i is given by si(t), the sales correlation is given by\n\nCij (t ) =\nwhere\n\n\uf8e7\n\nT \u2212t\n1\n( si (t ' ) \u2212 si )( s j (t '+t ) \u2212 s j ) dt '\n\u222b\nsi s j (T \u2212 t ) 0\n\n2\n\nstands for a time average. Since the variance should be proportional to the number\n\nof sales events, Cij(t) should be independent of the size of the brand. This is checked for all\nsauces (ketchup, mayonnaise and curry cause) and indeed found to be the case. We first\n\n6\n\n\fRD Groot, L\u00e9vy distribution and long correlation times in supermarket sales\nconcentrate on the baseline sales auto-correlation, and then study cross correlations. The\nvalue of the auto-correlation at t = 0 is the number of sales events that are correlated. To see\nthis, let mean sales be given by <s> = Ns0 where N is the number of independent events,\nand s0 the average amount sold in such an event. The variance in the mean is \u03c32 = Ns02,\nhence C(0) = \u03c32/<s> = s0.\nIf the broad noise distribution is a remnant of promotions, one would expect a sharp peak at\nt = 0 and no signal after the first week, since promotions only run for one week. To calculate\nthe sales correlation functions, the data can be detrended or not. Detrending means that the\nmean trend over the 118-week period is subtracted from the sales curves, such that the\nmean slope will vanish [14]. This obviously takes away fluctuations on the time scale of two\nyears or more, but it would correct for a continually rising or declining market. For ketchup,\ndetrending or not detrending has little influence on the result, for curry sauce and\nmayonnaise the differences are larger. Taking the mean and half difference of the detrended\nand non-detrended correlation functions as our estimate and its error bar, the results for all\nthree markets are within the uncertainty of the others. Thus, within a first approximation the\nthree markets show the same sales auto-correlation function, which is shown in Figure 5.\nThe small dots in Figure 5 are brand averages for the individual categories; the big squares\nwith error bars represent the average and spread over the three markets. Two things should\nbe noted. Firstly, in all markets the point at t = 0 lies above the extrapolated value\ndetermined from the other points. The actual values at t = 0 are Cii(0) = 206, 206 and 340 for\nketchup, curry sauce and mayonnaise, whereas the extrapolated values respectively are\ngiven by 118\u00b17, 122\u00b15 and 234\u00b18. For the average over all products we find an actual value\nat t = 0 of C(0) = 251, and an extrapolated value of 158\u00b14. The error bars indicated are the\nuncertainty in the extrapolation, obtained by fitting an exponential through the correlation\nfunction. This does not include the systematic error that shows up in the difference between\ndetrending the data or not. This error is similar in size to the error bars between the markets,\nwhich are shown in Figure 5.\nIndeed, the auto-correlation function in t = 0 is higher than the value extrapolated from the\ncorrelation at t > 0. This excess can be attributed to be a remnant of the promotions, but this\nrepresents only 37% of the variance. Other effects like weather variations or holidays may\nhave also an influence on this term. Most of the variance is related to fluctuations of the\nbaseline, and is thus caused by intrinsic market moves. As can be seen from Figure 5, these\nfluctuations have a very long correlation time as compared to the typical 4 minutes seen in\n\n7\n\n\fRD Groot, L\u00e9vy distribution and long correlation times in supermarket sales\nstock markets [12]. The mean correlation function averaged over all brands and markets for\nt > 0 is given by\n\nCii (t ) \u2248 (158 \u00b1 4) exp(\u2212\n\nt\n)\n10.2 \u00b1 0.4\n\n3\n\nwhere t is in weeks. The slow correlation time points at an internal dynamical process, this\ncould be customer loyalty and repeat buys, but certainly cannot be due to promotions.\nWe now discuss the cross correlations, and focus upon the cross-correlations between\nketchup brands. When the top brand has a large peak due to a promotional action one might\nexpect the other brands to have a (small) sales decrease. This, however, is not seen.\nWhether we correlate the full sales with baseline sales, or take the correlation between\nbaseline sales does not matter significantly for the result. The cross correlation function\nbetween top brand and the others vanishes within the noise, although close to t = 0 a small\npositive correlation might be present, see Figure 6. This observation again confirms that\nbecause the cross correlation is zero, the noise in the baseline cannot be a remnant of the\npromotional noise. Figure 6 also shows the mean cross correlation between the three lower\nketchup brands. Instead of having a negative correlation at t = 0, it has an unexpected\npositive correlation. The amplitude at t = 0 is Cij(0) = 69\u00b13, and the decay time is \u03c4 =\n10.9\u00b10.8 weeks. Within the uncertainty, the cross-correlation time between the lower brands\nis thus equal to the auto-correlation time. Hence the whole market is governed by a process\nwith a single time scale of about 10 - 11 weeks.\nTo gain further insight into the nature of the processes that determine the baseline sales\ndynamics, the Fourier transform of the baseline sales data, s(\u03c9) = 2/T 0\u222bT s(t) exp(i\u03c9t) dt is\nstudied. If indeed there are two processes, one of which is much faster than the other, this\nshould show up as a signal at high frequency. Thus we could separate the high frequency\nnoise from the noise spectrum of the slow process. The baseline sales correlation is readily\nobtained as\n\nC (\u03c9 ) =\n\n1 N\n\u2211 si (\u03c9 )si (\u2212\u03c9 ) / < si >\nN i =1\n\n4\n\nC(\u03c9) is actually the Fourier transform of the function Cii(t) defined above, and is an average\nover all brands. There is a subtle difference though. By taking the Fourier transform the\nconvolution is calculated, implicitly assuming that the function s is periodic in T, whereas in\nEq 2 the time average is restricted to the interval where t+t' < T, and no periodicity is\nassumed. The error bars are the estimated error in the mean, based on the spread in the\n\n8\n\n\fRD Groot, L\u00e9vy distribution and long correlation times in supermarket sales\ndata for each point. The autocorrelation functions of the baseline sales have been\ndetermined for 11 brands and products. Two curry brands had long running new product\nintroductions, which were counted as promotions by ACNielsen. This seriously affects the\nbaseline for these brands and therefore these were left out of the statistics. If we average\nover all 11 products and assume that there is a unique mean value at each frequency, we\nobtain the function shown in Figure 7. The points are averaged over two to four successive\nfrequencies to reduce noise. The logarithm of the correlation function is averaged over all\nbrands. The full curve shown in Figure 7 is a fit to a single Maxwell mode and a constant\nnoise term, G(\u03c9) = a/(1+(\u03c9\u03c4)2)+c, the dashed curve is a fit to a power law plus a constant,\nG(\u03c9) = 1/(\u03c9\u03c4)\u03b1+c. Within the uncertainty of the data the two fit functions are equally valid.\nHence, over about a decade in frequency the correlation function scales with an apparent\npower law G(\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9\u2212\u03b1 with power \u03b1 = 1.5\u00b10.1.\n\n5 Discussion\nThe analysis of baseline sales of three different products (ketchup, mayonnaise and curry)\nhas led to four new observations, namely:\n1. the sales noise level is much higher than can be expected for uncorrelated buying events\n2. weekly sales differences show a broad non-Gaussian distribution with fat tails\n3. this sales distribution is similar to the price return distribution of stock markets\n4. the baseline auto-correlation shows a long correlation time or an apparent power law\nbehaviour at low frequency.\nA trivial explanation for the first observation might be that the sample upon which the sales\ndata is based is actually smaller than claimed. However, this explanation can be ruled out by\nthe data. The correlation function averaged over all products extrapolates to zero at a mean\nvalue of about 160. This means that the intrinsic variance in the baseline sales is 160 times\nlarger than actual sales. If this is to be explained on the basis is the sample size, the data\nmust be based on only 32 shops. This is not realistic. Moreover, this trivial explanation would\nimply that the noise level is based on fewer sales events that are all independent. Such a\nmodel of independent consumers, going through independent buying decisions, would\ndirectly lead to Gaussian fluctuations. This again is falsified by the data: the fluctuation\nspectrum resembles that of a (truncated) L\u00e9vy flight. This points at strong correlations\nbetween the behaviour of consumers. With other words, the notion of independent\nconsumers who take independent decisions is false.\n\n9\n\n\fRD Groot, L\u00e9vy distribution and long correlation times in supermarket sales\nThe explanation that the noise is a remnant of promotions is also ruled out by the data.\nIndeed the extrapolated value of the auto-correlation function is lower than the actual value\nat t = 0. The difference can be attributed to short time effects like promotions, weather etc,\nbut this can only explain some 37% of the variance. The major part of the fluctuations is\nrelated to an intrinsic process on a time scale of some 10 weeks.\nL\u00e9vy distributions have been observed recently in commodity markets [15], but unlike the\nearlier result by Mandelbrot for the cotton market [16], these studies showed higher\nexponents of distributions that are not L\u00e9vy stable. The reason for this is that the market\ncrosses over from L\u00e9vy stable behaviour with \u03b1 \u2248 1.4, to power law behaviour with \u03b1 \u2248 3.\nThe crossover point is located near an absolute return of roughly 3 standard deviations\n[9,12,15]. Mandelbrot did not have enough data to see this crossover. The present analysis\nof sales to consumers also lacks the amount of data to see this limiting law. However, the\nresult in Figure 4 is consistent with a truncated L\u00e9vy distribution that crosses over by 3\nstandard deviations. It should be mentioned here that weekly sales returns of soups have\nalso been analysed, and added to the distribution. For this combined data set we do start to\nsee a crossover. However, soup consumption is very season dependent. Hence, to analyse\nthis data the yearly variation had to be subtracted by detrending against periodic functions.\nThis also led to spurious oscillations in the auto-correlation function. For this reason we\ncannot say whether this crossover in the combined data set is fortuitous or not, hence the\ndata was left out of Figure 4.\nUnlike for stock market price returns, the auto-correlation function of baseline sales\nfluctuations shows a long time correlation. Whether this correlation is an exponential decay\nor a power law cannot be determined with complete certainty. The analysis in real time\n(Figure 5 and Figure 6) suggests an exponential, but the size of the error bars should be\ntaken seriously. This is a systematic error that shows the difference between detrending and\nnot detrending the data. This strong influence implies that there are modes on the time scale\nof the full 120-week period. This result is qualitatively in line with the recent analysis by\nSornette et al of endogenous versus exogenous shocks in complex networks, who find\npower law decay in peaks of Amazon book sales [17,18].\nThere are basically two different explanations for the occurrence of fat tails in markets. The\nfirst is that the system is in a self-organised critical state [19], and that \"avalanches\" occur\nregularly. The second explanation is that actions are correlated because agents are linked in\na social network. The first explanation is closely related to the theory of avalanche dynamics.\nIn this theory 1/f-noise is related to anomalous random walks of the underlying process [20].\n10\n\n\fRD Groot, L\u00e9vy distribution and long correlation times in supermarket sales\nA class of deterministic models introduced by Olami, Feder and Christensen exhibits 1/fnoise with an exponent that depends on the degree of conservation [21]. In a similar model\nof artificial societies a cellular automaton evolves towards a critical state, with avalanches\nobeying finite size scaling [22]. This principle of self-organized criticality has been applied to\nfinancial market modelling by Ponzi and Aizawa [23]. Their model describes an evolving\nnetwork of traders, subject to Darwinian evolution. It produces a L\u00e9vy distribution of the\ncorrect exponent for the price returns, and it reproduces clustered volatility.\nThe simplest market model exhibiting self-organised criticality is the Minority Game. This has\nbeen applied to market simulation with different species of traders with finite capital [24].\nWealth is accumulated in the course of the simulation, and the richer agents have more\ninfluence on the market. As in the standard Minority Game, a phase transition is found,\ndepending on the ratio of the information complexity and the number of agents. The\nemergent picture is that when agents are few, the market is rich of profitable opportunities.\nThese attract others to the market. As the number of agents increases, the opportunities are\neliminated and the market is driven towards its critical point. This suggests why real markets\noperate close to the critical point where profitable trade opportunities are barely detectable.\nChallet et al [24] state that the process by which the market self-organises is likely to be of\nevolutionary nature, and hence takes place on longer time-scales.\nThere is an obvious competition amongst the producers, which may give rise to an\nevolutionary effect (including \"avalanches\"), but whether or not this can explain the fast sales\nvariations on a weekly basis is questionable. Evolution is related to product improvements,\nand their fitness to the market. Indeed the market is very dynamic, and new products are\nintroduced regularly, but the typical time scale involved is months rather than weeks. One\nmay speculate that this corresponds to the 10-11 week time scale seen in the sales autocorrelation function. On the other hand, in the examples studied here only three to six\nleading brands are competing, which is a small number for such complex behaviour, even if\neach brand actually holds six or more different items in their product portfolio.\nThe second explanation for stylised fact in markets is that the behaviour of agents is\ncorrelated because they are linked in a social network. If they tend to follow the decisions of\ntheir peers, sales becomes correlated which gives rise to larger sales fluctuations. A\nsimulation model that incorporates this effect must contain a large number of consumer\ngroups, that have mutual interactions and that drive the market system to a critical point. In\nmarketing language, these groups may correspond to the particular segmentation of the\nmarket. The critical point should then correspond to a consumer segment distribution that is\n11\n\n\fRD Groot, L\u00e9vy distribution and long correlation times in supermarket sales\ngiven by Zipf's law [13]. The archetypal model to describe such correlated behaviour due to\nsocial networks is the Cont-Bouchaud percolation model [25]. This model is based on a\nrandom communication structure between agents, which gives rise to power-laws in price\nfluctuations and herding behaviour. The model assumes that agents form coalitions, where\nall agents in one coalition take the same (random) decision to buy, sell, or do nothing. The\ncoalitions are formed through a stochastic process, where each agent is linked to any other\none with a given probability. At a critical probability, the system shows a percolation\ntransition, where a very broad distribution of cluster sizes appears. Since the cluster size\ndistribution has an algebraic decay, so does the distribution of price variations because the\nprice variation follows the excess demand. Hence, the correct stylised facts are found when\nthe correct cluster size distribution is put in by hand [13,26], or when the random clusters are\nformed by simulating the Ising model at its critical point [27]. Lux and Marchesi describe a\nmulti-agent model of financial markets which supports the idea that scaling arises from\nmutual interactions of participants. Their model contains a news arrival processes that lacks\npower-law scaling and time dependence in volatility, yet it generates such behaviour as a\nresult of interactions between agents [28]. Finally, social networks are key in the analysis of\nSornette et al of endogenous and exogenous shocks in book sales [17,18].\nIn reality both the competitive evolution of brand fitness and the network structure of the\nconsumers may be pertinent. However, there are two arguments that point to the latter effect\nas being dominant. Firstly, the avalanches seen in evolution theory describe the correlated\nextinction of many species. Translated to the market this would mean many brands going\nbust at the same time, rather than many consumers buying the same product at the same\ntime. This is not in line with observations. Secondly, 58% of the long time variance in\nketchup sales is cross-correlated between brands, and the time scales for the autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions are the same. This points at a cause for the\nfluctuations that is common to all brands, rather than to the brand management strategy and\nevolution of brands. The question thus arising is how these clusters of correlated consumer\nbehaviour are formed. Why do all consumers simultaneously decide to buy mayonnaise? It\nis speculated that advertisements play a crucial role in forming such correlation, and in\ngenerating the non-Gaussian distribution of sales returns, as this may create a broad\ndistribution of consumers who have and who have not been influenced.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author thanks Dr PAD Musters for providing data and for critical discussions.\n\n12\n\n\fRD Groot, L\u00e9vy distribution and long correlation times in supermarket sales\n\n6 References\n[1] FM Bass, TV Krishnan, DC Jain, \"Why the Bass model fits without decision variables\", Marketing\nScience 13 (1994) 203-223.\n[2] W Arthur, \"Inductive Reasoning And Bounded Rationality\", American Economic Review 84 (1994)\n406-411.
