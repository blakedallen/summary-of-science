Both high resolution (R\u223c20000) and\nmoderate resolution (R \u223c 5000) have been used.\nIn some cases these regions, about 100 to 150 pc in\nsize, are seen to be composed of several individual star\nclusters with sizes between 1.5 and 4.9 pc estimated\nfrom Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images.

The measured\nvalues of the stellar velocity dispersions yield dynamical masses of the order of 107 to 108 solar masses for\nthe whole CNSFRs.\nWe obtain oxygen abundances which are comparable to those found in high metallicity disc HII regions\nfrom direct measurements of electron temperatures and\nconsistent with solar values within the errors. The region with the highest oxygen abundance is R3+R4 in\nNGC 3504, 12+log(O/H) = 8.85, about 1.5 solar if\nthe solar oxygen abundance is set at the value derived\nby Asplund et al.

On the\nother hand, the S/O ratios span a very narrow range\nbetween 0.6 and 0.8 of the solar value. As compared to\nhigh metallicity disc HII regions, CNSFR show values of\nthe O23 and the N2 parameters whose distributions are\nshifted to lower and higher values respectively, hence,\neven though their derived oxygen and sulphur abundances are similar, higher values would in principle be\nobtained for the CNSFR if pure empirical methods were\nused to estimate abundances. CNSFR also show lower\nionisation parameters than their disc counterparts, as\nderived from the [SII]/[SIII]. Their ionisation structure\nalso seems to be different with CNSFR showing radiation field properties more similar to HII galaxies than\nto disc high metallicity HII regions.\n\n1 Introduction\nThe inner (\u223c 1Kpc) parts of some spiral galaxies show\nstar formation complexes frequently arranged in an annular pattern around their nuclei. These complexes are\nsometimes called \"hot spots\" and we will refer to these\nas circumnuclear starforming regions (CNSFRs). Their\nsizes go from a few tens to a few hundreds of pc (e.g.\nD\u0131\u0301az et al. 2000) and they seem to be made of an ensamble of HII regions ionised by luminous compact stellar clusters whose sizes, as measured from high spatial\nresolution HST images, are seen to be of only a few pc.\nThe luminosities of CNSFRs are rather large with\nabsolute visual magnitudes (Mv ) between -12 and\n-17 and H\u03b1 luminosities which are comparable to\nthose shown by 30 Dor, the largest HII region in the\nLMC, and overlap with those shown by HII galaxies\n(Melnick et al. 1988; D\u0131\u0301az et al. 2000; Hoyos & D\u0131\u0301az\n\n\f2\n\n2006, and references therein). In the ultraviolet (UV),\nmassive stars dominate the observed circumnuclear\nemission even in the presence of an active nucleus\nGonz\u00e1lez-Delgado et al. (1998); Colina et al. (2002).\nIn many cases, CNSFR show emission line spectra\nsimilar to those of disc HII regions. However, they\nshow a higher continuum from background stellar populations as expected from their circumnuclear location.\nThe analysis of these spectra gives us the oportunity\nto measure the gas abundances close to galactic nuclei\nwhich, in the case of early type spirals, are expected to\nbe amongst the highest metallicity regions.\nThe importance of an accurate determination of the\nabundances of high metallicity HII regions cannot be\noverestimated since they constitute most of the HII regions in early spiral galaxies (Sa to Sbc) and the inner\nregions of most late type ones (Sc to Sd) D\u0131\u0301az (1989)\nwithout which our description of the metallicity distribution in galaxies cannot be complete. In particular,\nthe effects of the choice of different calibrations on the\nderivation of abundance gradients can be very important since any abundance profile fit will be strongly biased towards data points at the ends of the distribution.\nIt should be kept in mind that abundance gradients are\nwidely used to constrain chemical evolution models, histories of star formation over galactic discs or galaxy\nformation scenarios. Also, the question of how high is\nthe highest oxygen abundance in the gaseous phase of\ngalaxies is still standing and extrapolation of known radial abundance gradients would point to CNSFR as the\nmost probable sites for these high metallicities.\nAccurate measures of elemental abundances of high\nmetallicity regions are also crucial to obtain reliable\ncalibrations of empirical abundance estimators, widely\nused but poorly constrained, whose choice can severely\nbias results obtained for quantities of the highest relevance for the study of galactic evolution like the\nluminosity-metallicity (L-Z) relation for galaxies.\n\nset, also obtained with the same instrumentation had\na lower resolution of 3.4 and 1.7 \u00c5 in the blue and red\nspectral regions respectively and a wider total coverage\nfrom 3600 to 9650 \u00c5. These data were used to derive the\nphysical conditions and the abundances of the emitting\ngas.\nSeveral CNSFR were observed in the spiral galaxies:\nNGC 2903, NGC 3351 and NGC 3504. Archive images\nobtained with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera\n2 and the NICMOS Camera 3 both on-board the HST\nwere also downloaded in order to complement the study.\nFigure 1 shows the optical image of NGC 3351 with\nthe slit positions used for the two sets of observations.\nFigure 2 shows the spatial distribution of the H\u03b2 and\ncontinuum emission along one of the slit positions observed. As can be seen from these profiles, some clusters\nare dominated by continuum emission while in other\ncases gaseous line emission is clearly important.\n\n3 Summary of kinematical results\nGas velocity dispersions were measured by performing Gaussian fits to the H\u03b2 \u03bb 4861 \u00c5 and [OIII] \u03bb\n5007 \u00c5 lines on the high dispersion spectra (Figure\n3). Stellar velocity dispersions dispersions were measured using the CaT lines at \u03bb\u03bb 8494, 8542, 8662 \u00c5using\nthe cross-correlation technique described in detail by\nTonry & Davis (1979). Late type giant and supergiant\nstars that have strong CaT absorption lines were used\nas stellar velocity templates.\nFor the 5 CNSFR observed in NGC 3351, stellar\nvelocity dispersions are found to be between 39 and\n67 km s\u22121 , about 20 km s\u22121 larger than those measured\nfor the gas, if a single Gaussian fit is used. However,\nthe best fits obtained involved two different components\nfor the gas: a \"broad component\" with a velocity dispersion similar to that measured for the stars, and a\n\n2 Observations\nAs part of the programme to study the properties of\nCNSFR we obtained two sets of data with the Intermediate dispersion Spectrograph and Imaging System\n(ISIS) attached to the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope\n(WHT). The first set of observations consisted of high\nresolution blue and far-red long-slit spectra covering the\nemission lines of H\u03b2 and [OIII] and the CaII triplet lines\nrespectively. At the attained resolution of 0.4 and 0.7\n\u00c5 respectively, these data allowed the measurement of\nradial velocities and velocity dispersions of the gas and\nstars in the regions down to 25 km s\u22121 . The second\n\nFig. 1 F606W (wide V) image centred on NGC 3351 obtained with the WFPC2 camera of the Hubble Space Telescope showing the WHT-ISIS slit positions overplotted for\nthe kinematics set observations (left) and the abundance set\nobservations (right).

These two components\nwere found both in the hydrogen recombination lines\n(Balmer and Paschen) and in the [OIII] \u03bb 5007 \u00c5 line.\nThe narrow component is dominant in the H recombination lines, while the broad component dominates the\n[OIII] one. Figure 4 shows this effect.\nCNSFR are seen to consist of several individual\nstar clusters, although some of them seem to have an\nonly knot, at the HST resolution. The derived masses\nfor the individual clusters as derived using the sizes\nmeasured on the HST images are between 1.8 and\n8.7 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 . These values are between 5.5 and 26\ntimes the mass derived for the SSC A in NGC 1569 by\nHo & Filippenko (1996) and larger than other kinematically derived SSC masses. Values for the dynamical masses of the CNSFRs are in the range between\n4.9 \u00d7 106 and 4.3 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 . Masses derived from the\nH\u03b2 velocity dispersion under the assumption of a single\ncomponent for the gas would have been underestimated\nby factors between approximately 2 to 4.\nThe masses of the ionising stellar clusters of the\nCNSFRs have been derived from their H\u03b1 luminosities\nunder the assumption that the regions are ionisation\nbound and without taking into account any photon absorption by dust. Their values are between 8-0 \u00d7 105\nand 2.5 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 . Therefore, the ratio of the ionising\nstellar population to the total dynamical mass is between 0.02 and 0.16.\nThe SSC in the observed CNSFRs seem to contain\ncomposite stellar populations. Although the youngest\none dominates the UV light and is responsible for the\n\nnormalized counts\n\n1\n\nFig. 2 Spatial light profiles along one of the slit position\nin NGC 3351.

Notice the absence of conspicuous\nemission lines in the red spectral range for this region.\n\ngas ionisation, it constitutes only about 10 % of the total. This can explain the low equivalent widths of emission lines measured in these regions. This may well apply to the case of other SSC and therefore conclusions\ndrawn from fits of SSP (single stellar population) models should be taken with caution (e.g. Mc Crady et al.\n2003). Also the composite nature of the CNSFRs means\nthat star formation in the rings is a process that has\ntaken place over time periods much longer than those\nimplied by the properties of the ionised gas.\n\n4 Abundance analysis\nFor 12 CNSFRs in the galaxies NGC 2903, NGC 3351\nand NGC 3504 chemical abundances of O, N and S\nwere derived from the lower resolution spectra.

The most\ncommonly used abundance indicator, O23 , involves the\nsum of the [OII] and [OIII] emission lines, supposed to\nbe almost independent of geometrical effects in the nebulae. However, this indicator is not well calibrated at\nthe high metallicity end where the oxygen lines are so\nweak that the value of the R23 practically saturates.\nThe sulphur lines, much stronger than the oxygen\nlines in high metallicity regions, provide an alternative way to derive their abundances. We have developed a new method for the derivation of sulphur abundances based on the calibration of the [SIII] electron\ntemperature vs the empirical parameter SO23 defined\nas the quotient of the oxygen and sulphur abundance\nparameters O23 and S23 and the further assumption\n\n9000\n\n9200\n\n\u03bb\n\n9400\n\n9600\n\nFig. 5 Blue (upper panel) and red (lower panel) spectra\nof region R12 in NGC 2903\n\nthat T([SIII]) \u2243 T([SII]). Then the oxygen abundances\nand the N/O and S/O ratios can also be derived. Figure\n6 shows this calibration for which data from different\nsources as listed in D\u0131\u0301az et al. (2007) have been used.\nThe actual fit to the data gives:\nte ([SIII]) = 0.596 \u2212 0.283logSO23 + 0.199(logSO23)2\nOnly for one of the regions, the [SIII] \u03bb 6312 \u00c5 line\nwas detected providing, together with the nebular [SIII]\nlines at \u03bb\u03bb 9069, 9532 \u00c5 , a value of the electron temperature of Te ([SIII])= 8400+4650\n\u22121250 K. This value is slightly\nhigher than predicted by the proposed fit and is represented as a solid upside down triangle in Figure 6.\nThe derived oxygen abundances are comparable to\nthose found in high metallicity disc HII regions from\ndirect measurements of electron temperatures and are\nconsistent with solar values within the errors. The highest oxygen abundance derived is 12+log(O/H) = 8.85,\nabout 1.5 solar 1 . The lowest oxygen abundance derived\n1 The\n\nsolar oxygen abundance is taken as the value derived by\nAsplund et al.

In all the observed CNSFR\nthe O/H abundance is dominated by the O+ /H+ contribution, as is also the case for high metallicity disc\nHII regions. For our observed regions, however also\nthe S+ /S2+ ratio is larger than one. This is not the\ncase for the high metallicity disc HII regions for which,\nin general, the sulphur abundances are dominated by\nS2+ /H+ . The derived N/O ratios are in average larger\nthan those found in high metallicity disc HII regions\nand they do not seem to follow the trend of N/O vs\nO/H which marks the secondary behaviour of nitrogen.\nOn the other hand, the S/O ratios span a very narrow\nrange between 0.6 and 0.8 of the solar value.\n\n5 Ionized gas characteristics\nFrom the calculated values of the number of Lyman \u03b1\nphotons, Q(H0 ), ionisation parameter and electron density, it is possible to derive the size of the emitting regions as well as the filling factor (see Castellanos et al.\n2002).The derived sizes are between 1.5 arcsec and 5.7\narcsec which correspond to linear dimensions between\n74 and 234 pc. The derived filling factors, between 6 \u00d7\n10\u22124 and 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 , are lower than commonly found in\ngiant HII regions (\u223c 0.01). H\u03b1 luminosities are larger\nthan the typical ones found for disc HII regions and\noverlap with those measured in HII galaxies. The region\nwith the largest H\u03b1 luminosity is R3+R4 in NGC 3504,\nfor which a value of 2.02 \u00d7 1040 is measured. Ionising\ncluster masses range between 1.1 \u00d7 105 and 4.7 \u00d7 106\nM\u2299 but could be lower by factors between 1.5 and 15\nif the contribution by the underlying stellar population\n\n9\n\n9.2\n\n9.4\n\n12+log(O/H)\n\n20\nHigh metallicity HII regions\nCNSFR\n\n15\n\nN\n\nFig. 6 Empirical calibration of the [SIII] electron temperature as a function of the abundance parameter SO23 .

These values are consistent with\nthose found from the kinematical data set.\nWhen compared to high metallicity disc HII regions,\nCNSFR show values of the O23 and the N2 parameters\nwhose distributions are shifted to lower and higher values respectively, hence, even though their derived oxygen and sulphur abundances are similar, higher values\nwould in principle be obtained for the CNSFR if pure\nempirical methods were used to estimate abundances.\nThis can be seen in Figure 7 where the distributions of\nthe derived O/H abundances and the O23 pararameter\nfor CNSFR and high metallicity disc HII regions are\nshown.\nCNSFR also show lower ionisation parameters than\ntheir disc counterparts, as derived from the [SII]/[SIII]\n\n\f6\n2\n1.5\n\nHigh metallicity disc HII regions\nHigh metallicity CNSFRs\nHII galaxies\nCNSFRs in NGC 3310 and NGC 7714\n\nlog([OII]/[OIII])\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n-1.5\n-2\n-2\n\nlog \u03b7' \u223c 0.7\n\n-1.5\n\nlog \u03b7' \u223c 0.0\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nlog([SII]/[SIII])\n\nFig. 8 Distribution of the [SII]/[SIII] ratio for the observed\nCNSFR (dark) and the sample of high metallicity disc HII\nregions (light) showing the segregation between the two families of objects in ionisation parameter\n\nratio. Their ionisation structure also seems to be different with CNSFR showing radiation field properties\nmore similar to HII galaxies than to disc high metallicity HII regions. This can be seen in Figure 8 that shows\n[OII]/[OIII] ratio vs [SII]/[SIII]. Since the parameter \u03b7,\nwhich is the quotient of these two ratios, is a good indicator of ionising temperature V\u0131\u0301lchez & Pagel (1988),\ndiagonal lines in this plot should run along objects with\nsimilar temperatures. CNSFR in this diagram also segregate from the high metallicity disc HII regions pointing to higher values of the ionising temperature.\nThe possible contamination of their spectra from\nhidden low luminosity AGN and/or shocks, as well as\nthe probable presence of more than one velocity component in the ionised gas corresponding to kinematically\ndistinct systems (see Section 3 above), should be further investigated.\nAcknowledgements This research has been supported by DGICYT grant AYA-2004-02860-C03.\n\n\fThe ionized gas of circumnuclear star-forming regions\n\nReferences\nAsplund, M., Grevesse, N., Sauval, A.
