Introduction and results\nThe objective of this paper is to find a characterization of stationary stochastic processes\nthat can be studied via a martingale approximation in order to derive the functional\ncentral limit theorem for processes associated with partial sums.\nThere are several ways to present the results since stationary processes can be introduced in several equivalent ways. We assume that (\u03ben )n\u2208Z denotes a stationary Markov\nchain defined on a probability space (\u03a9, F , P ) with values in a measurable space (S, A).\nThe marginal distribution and the transition kernel are denoted by \u03c0(A) = P (\u03be0 \u2208 A)\nand Q(\u03be0 , A) =R P (\u03be1 \u2208 A|\u03be0 ), respectively. In addition, Q denotes the operator acting\n2\nvia\nR 2(Qf )(\u03be) = S f R(s)Q(\u03be, ds). Next, let L0 (\u03c0) be the set of functions on S such that\nf d\u03c0 < \u221e and f d\u03c0 = 0. Denote by Fk the \u03c3-field generated by \u03bei with i \u2264 k,\nPn\u22121\nXi = f (\u03bei ), Sn = i=0\nXi (i.e., S0 = 0, S1 = X0 , S2 = X0 + X1 , . . .).

In our notation, E0 (X1 ) = Qf (\u03be0 ) = E(X1 |\u03be0 ).\nWe also set F\u2212\u221e = k\u2208Z Fk .\nThroughout the paper, we assume f \u2208 L20 (\u03c0); in other words, we assume that kXk2 =\n(E[X12 ])1/2 < \u221e and E[X1 ] = 0.\nNote that any stationary sequence (Yk )k\u2208Z can be viewed as a function of a Markov\nprocess \u03bek = (Yi ; i \u2264 k) for the function g(\u03bek ) = Yk .\nThe stationary stochastic processes may be also introduced in the following, alternative, way. Let T : \u03a9 7\u2192 \u03a9 be a bijective bimeasurable transformation preserving the\nprobability. Let F0 be a sub-\u03c3-algebra of F satisfying F0 \u2286 T \u22121 (F0 ). We then define the\nnon-decreasing filtration (Fi )i\u2208Z by Fi = T \u2212i (F0 ). Let X0 be a random variable which\nis F0 -measurable. We define the stationary sequence (Xi )i\u2208Z by Xi = X0 \u25e6 T i .\nIn this paper, we shall use both frameworks.\nPn\u22121\nIn order to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the partial sums Sn = i=0 Xi , Gordin,\nin [15], proposed to decompose the sums related to the original stationary sequence into\nthe sum\nSn = Mn + Rn\n(1)\nPn\u22121\nof a square-integrable martingale Mn = i=0 Di adapted to Fn , whose martingale\ndifferences (Di ) are stationary, and a so-called coboundary Rn , that is, a telescoping\nsum of random variables with the basic property that supn E(Rn2 ) < \u221e. More precisely,\nXn = Dn + Zn \u2212 Zn\u22121 , where Zn is another stationary sequence in L2 . The limiting\nproperties of the martingales can then be transported from the martingale to the general sequence. In the context of Markov chains, the existence of such a decomposition is\nequivalent to the solvability of the Poisson equation in L2 .\nFor proving a central limit theorem for stationary sequences, a weaker form of martingale approximation has been pointed out by many authors (see, e.g., [21] for a survey).\nRecently, two interesting papers, one by Dedecker, Merlev\u00e8de and Voln\u00fd [7] and the other\nby Zhao and Woodroofe [32], provided necessary and sufficient conditions for martingale\napproximation with an error term in (1) satisfying\nE((Sn \u2212 Mn )2 )/n \u2192 0.\n\n(2)\n\nThis decomposition is strong enough for transporting the conditional\ncentral limit theo\u221a\nrem from sums of stationary martingale differences in L2 to Sn / n. By conditional CLT,\nas discussed in [6], we understand, in this context, that for any continuous function f\nsuch that |f (x)|/(1 + x2 ) is bounded and for any k \u2265 0,\n\u221a\nEk (f (Sn / n)) \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221a\nf (x \u03b7)g(x) dx\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n1\n\n\u2212\u2192 0,\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere g is the standard normal density and \u03b7 \u2265 0 is an invariant function satisfying\nlim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nE0 (Sn2 )\n\u2212\u03b7\nn\n\n= 0.\n1\n\n(3)\n\n\f426\n\nM. Gordin and M. Peligrad\n\nHere, and throughout the paper, we denote by k * kp the norm in Lp .\nAn important extension of this theory is to consider the conditional central limit\ntheorem in its functional form. For t \u2208 [0, 1], define\nSn (t) = S[nt] + (nt \u2212 [nt])X[nt] ,\n\n\u221a\nwhere [x] denotes the integer part of x. Note that Sn (*)/ n is a random element of\nthe space C([0, 1]) endowed with the supremum norm k * k\u221e . Then, by the conditional\nCLT in the functional form (FCLT), we understand that for any continuous function\nf : C([0, 1]) \u2192 R such that x 7\u2192 |f (x)|/(1 + kxk2\u221e ) is bounded and for any k \u2265 0, we have\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(f (x \u03b7)) dW (x) \u2212\u2192 0.\n(4)\nEk (f (Sn / n)) \u2212\nC([0,1])\n\n1\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nHere, W is the standard Wiener measure on C([0, 1]).\nIt is well known that a martingale\nPn\u22121 with stationary differences in L2 satisfies this type\nof behavior with \u03b7 = limn\u2192\u221e l=0 Dl2 /n in L1 \u2013 this is at the heart of many statistical\nprocedures. This conditional form of the invariance principle is a stable type of convergence that makes possible the change of measure with another absolutely continuous\nmeasure, as discussed in [1, 11, 27].\nWith such a result in mind, the question is now to find necessary and sufficient conditions for a martingale decomposition with the error term satisfying\n\u0010\n\u0011\nE max (Sj \u2212 Mj )2 /n \u2192 0.\n(5)\n1\u2264j\u2264n\n\nIn order to state our martingale approximation result, for fixed m, we consider the\nstationary sequence\nY0m =\n\n1\nE0 (X1 + * * * + Xm ),\nm\n\nYkm = Y0m \u25e6 T k .\n\n(6)\n\nIn the language of Markov operators, we then have\nY0m =\n\n1\n(Qf + * * * + Qm f )(\u03be0 ).\nm\n\nIt is convenient to introduce a seminorm notation, namely,\n1\nkZkM + = lim sup \u221a\nn\nn\u2192\u221e\non the space of all Z \u2208\n\nL20\n\nmax\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\nk\nX\nj=1\n\nZ \u25e6 Tj\n\n2\n\nwith kZkM + < \u221e.\n\nTheorem 1.

In particular, (7) implies (4).\nAs a consequence of the proof of Theorem 1, we also obtain the following result that\nadds a new equivalent condition to the characterizations by Dedecker, Merlev\u00e8de and\nVoln\u00fd [7] and Zhao and Woodroofe [32].

Such a martingale is\nunique if it exists. In particular, (8) implies (3).\nOur approach is constructive. If the stationary sequence is supposed to be ergodic,\nthen the constructed martingale differences are also ergodic and therefore the conditional\ntheorems (3) and (4) can be easily transported to the original processes satisfying (8)\nand (7), respectively, with \u03b7 = kD0 k2 .\nA natural and useful question is to provide classes of stochastic processes that have a\nmartingale decomposition with an error term satisfying (5), in other words, to provide\nsharp sufficient conditions for such a decomposition. Obviously, a maximal inequality is\nneeded in order to verify this condition. We shall combine our approach with several maximal inequalities. One is due to Rio [26], formula (3.9), page 53; for related inequalities,\nsee [23] and [9].\n\u2022 For any stationary process with centered variables in L2 ,\nn\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\nE|X0 E0 (Sk \u2212 S1 )|.\nE max Si2 \u2264 8nE(X02 ) + 16\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n\n(9)\n\nk=2\n\nAnother inequality comes from [24], Proposition (2.3); see also [25], Theorem 1, for\nthe inequality in Lp .\n\u2022 For any stationary process with centered variables in L2 ,\nr\u22121\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\nkE0 (S2j )k2\nE max Si2 \u2264 n 2kX0 k2 + 3\n1\u2264i\u2264n\n2j/2\nj=0\n\n!2\n\nn\nX\nkE0 (Sj )k2\n\n!2\n\n\u2264 n 2kX0 k2 + 80\n\nj=1\n\nj 3/2\n\n(10)\n,\n\n\f428\n\nM.

These include mixing processes and classes of Markov\nchains.\n\n2. Proof of Theorem 1\nThe proof of this theorem has several steps.\nStep 1. Construction of the approximating martingale.\nThe construction of the martingale decomposition is based on averages. It was introduced by Wu and Woodroofe [35] (see their definition (6) on page 1677) and further\ndeveloped in [32], extending the construction in [12] and [17]; see also [3], Theorem 8.1,\nand [18]. We give the martingale construction here for completeness.\nWe introduce a parameter m \u2265 1 (kept fixed for the moment) and define the following\nstationary sequence of random variables:\nm\n\n\u03b80m =\n\n1 X\nE0 (Si ), \u03b8km = \u03b80m \u25e6 T k .\nm i=1\n\n\fFunctional CLT via martingale approximation\n\n429\n\nSet\nm\nm\nDkm = \u03b8k+1\n\u2212 Ek (\u03b8k+1\n),\n\nMnm =\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\nDkm .\n\n(13)\n\nk=0\n\nThen (Dkm )k\u2208Z is a stationary martingale difference sequence and (Mnm )n\u22650 is a martingale. Thus, we have\nm\nXk = Dkm + \u03b8km \u2212 \u03b8k+1\n+\n\n1\nEk (Sk+m+1 \u2212 Sk+1 )\nm\n\nand therefore\nSk = Mkm + \u03b80m \u2212 \u03b8km +\n\nk\nX\n1\nEj\u22121 (Sj+m \u2212 Sj )\nm\nj=1\nm\n\n= Mkm + \u03b80m \u2212 \u03b8km + Rk ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere we have made use of the notation\nm\n\nRk =\n\nk\nX\n1\nEj\u22121 (Sj+m \u2212 Sj ).\nm\nj=1\n\nObserve that\nm\n\nRk =\n\nk\u22121\nX\n\nYjm .\n\n(15)\n\nj=0\n\nWith the notation\nm\n\nRkm = \u03b80m \u2212 \u03b8km + Rk ,\n\n(16)\n\nSk = Mkm + Rkm .\n\n(17)\n\nwe have\n\nStep 2. Sufficiency.\nWe show that kY0m kM + \u2192 0 as m \u2192 \u221e is sufficient for (5).\nThe starting point is the construction of the martingale differences, as in (13). By the\nmartingale property and (17), for all positive integers m\u2032 and m\u2032\u2032 , we have\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n1\n1\nkD0m \u2212 D0m k2 = \u221a kMnm \u2212 Mnm k2 = \u221a kRnm \u2212 Rnm k2 .\nn\nn\n\nWe now let n \u2192 \u221e. By relation (16) and stationarity, it follows that\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n1\n1\nm\u2032\nm\u2032\u2032\nlim sup \u221a kRnm \u2212 Rnm k2 = lim sup \u221a kRn \u2212 Rn k2\nn\nn\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n1\nm\u2032\nm\u2032\u2032\n\u2264 lim sup \u221a (kRn k2 + kRn k2 ).\nn\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\f430\n\nM. Gordin and M. Peligrad\n\nBy (7), the limit when m\u2032 and m\u2032\u2032 both tend to \u221e is then 0, giving that (D0m ) is\nPn\u22121\nCauchy in L2 and therefore convergent. Denote its limit by D0 . Then Mn = k=0 Dk is\na martingale with the desired properties. To see this, we start from the decomposition in\nrelation (14) and obtain\nm\n\n|Sk \u2212 Mk | \u2264 |Mkm \u2212 Mk | + |\u03b8km \u2212 \u03b80m | + |Rk |.\nThen\n1\n\u221a\nn\n\nmax |Sk \u2212 Mk |\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\n2\n\n1\n\u2264\u221a\nn\n\nmax |Mkm \u2212 Mk |\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\n1\n1\n+ \u221a k\u03b80m k2 + \u221a\nn\nn\n\n2\n\nmax |\u03b8km |\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\n1\n+\u221a\nn\n2\n\nm\n\nmax |Rk | .\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\n2\n\nBy Doob's maximal inequality for martingales and by stationarity, we conclude that\n1\n\u221a\nn\n\nmax |Mkm \u2212 Mk |\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\n2\n\n\u2264 kD0m \u2212 D0 k2 .\n\nFor m fixed, since (\u03b8km )k\u2208Z is a stationary sequence of square-integrable random variables,\nfor any A > 0, we have\nn\ni A2\n1X\n1 h\nE max |\u03b8km |2 \u2264\n+\nE[|\u03b8km |2 I(|\u03b8km | > A)]\nn 1\u2264k\u2264n\nn\nn\nk=1\n\n2\n\n=\n\nA\n+ E[|\u03b80m |2 I(|\u03b80m | > A)]\nn\n\nand then, clearly,\ni\n1 h\nE max |\u03b8km |2 = 0.\nn\u2192\u221e n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\nlim\n\n(18)\n\nThen, taking into account (15), we easily obtain\n1\nlim sup \u221a\nn\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nmax |Sk \u2212 Mk |\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\n2\n\n\u2264 kD0m \u2212 D0 k2 + kY0m kM +\n\nand the result follows by letting m \u2192 \u221e, from the fact that D0m \u2192 D0 in L2 . It is easy\nto see that the martingale is unique.\nStep 3. Necessity.\nAssume that the martingale approximation (5) holds.

By the triangle inequality, followed by Doob's inequality,\nfor any positive integer m, we have\n1\n\u221a\nn\n\nmax |Rkm |\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\n2\n\n1\n\u2264\u221a\nn\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\nmax |Rk |\n\n2\n\n1\n+\u221a\nn\n\n1\n\u2264\u221a\nn\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\nmax |Rk |\n\n2\n\n+ kD0m \u2212 D0 k.\n\nmax |Mkm \u2212 Mk |\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\n2\n\nNow, letting n \u2192 \u221e followed by m \u2192 \u221e, we obtain\n1\nlim lim sup \u221a\nn\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nmax |Rkm |\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\n\n2\n\n= 0.\n\n(20)\n\nm\n\nNow, observe that by (16), Rnm \u2212 Rn = \u03b80m \u2212 \u03b8nm . Then, for every fixed m, by (18), we\nhave\n1\n\u221a\nmax |\u03b8m \u2212 \u03b8km |\n\u2192 0.\nn 1\u2264k\u2264n 0\n2 n\u2192\u221e\nThus, we conclude from (20) that\nlim kY0m kM + = 0\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nand the necessity follows.\n\n3.

Application to mixing sequences\nThe results in the previous section can be immediately applied to mixing sequences,\nleading to the sharpest possible results and providing additional information about the\nstructures of these processes. Examples include various classes of Markov chains and\nGaussian processes.\nWe shall introduce the following mixing coefficients: for any two \u03c3-algebras A and B,\ndefine the strong mixing coefficient \u03b1(A, B),\n\u03b1(A, B) = sup{|P(A \u2229 B) \u2212 P(A)P(B)|; A \u2208 A, B \u2208 B},\nand the \u03c1-mixing coefficient, known also as the maximal coefficient of correlation \u03c1(A, B),\n\u03c1(A, B) = sup{Cov(X, Y )/kXk2kY k2 : X \u2208 L2 (A), Y \u2208 L2 (B)}.\n\n\fFunctional CLT via martingale approximation\n\n435\n\nn\nFor the stationary sequence of random variables (Xk )k\u2208Z , we also define Fm\n, the \u03c3n\nfield generated by Xi with indices m \u2264 i \u2264 n. F denotes the \u03c3-field generated by Xi\nwith indices i \u2265 n and Fm denotes the \u03c3-field generated by Xi with indices i \u2264 m. The\nsequences of coefficients \u03b1(n) and \u03c1(n) are then defined by\n\n\u03b1(n) = \u03b1(F0 , Fnn )\n\nand \u03c1(n) = \u03c1(F0 , F n ).\n\nEquivalently (see [2], Chapter 4),\n\u03c1(n) = sup{kE(Y |F0 )k2 /kY k2 : Y \u2208 L2 (F n ), E(Y ) = 0}.\nFinally, we say that the stationary sequence is strongly mixing if \u03b1(n) \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e\nand \u03c1-mixing if \u03c1(n) \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e.\nAn interesting application of Proposition 3 is to \u03c1-mixing sequences. It is well known\nthat the central limit theorem and its invariance principle hold for stationary centered\nsequences with finite second moments under the assumption\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=1\n\n\u03c1(2k ) < \u221e,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u03c1(n) = \u03c1(F0 , F n ). Let us recall that the central limit theorem is due to [14], while\nthe invariance principle is found in [22, 29\u201331]. The fact that condition (25) is sharp in\nthis context is due to [2], Volume 1, page 367, and Volume 3, Theorem 34.13. Bradley's\nexample shows that if (25) fails, then Sn /kSn k2 might have non-degenerate non-normal\ndistributions as weak limit points.\nAs a corollary of Proposition 3, we obtain the conditional invariance principle for\n\u03c1-mixing sequences.\nProposition 7.

To prove it, by using spectral\ncalculus for the self-adjoint operator Q, we obtain\nX\n\nk\u22650\n\nE(Y0m Ykm ) \u2264\n\n1\nm2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n(1 + t + * * * + tm\u22121 )2\n\u03c1f (dt)\n(1 \u2212 t)\n\nand therefore, for every positive integer m > 0,\nkY0m k2M +\n\n\u2264 27\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n(1 + t + * * * + tm\u22121 )2\n\u03c1f (dt).\nm2 (1 \u2212 t)\n\nR1\nSince \u22121 (1 \u2212 t)\u22121 \u03c1f (dt) < \u221e, the right-hand side is finite and, by the dominated convergence theorem,\nlim kY0m k2M + = 0.\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0003\n\nSimilar results are expected to hold for other classes of stationary and ergodic Markov\nchains when Q is not necessarily self-adjoint, but instead satisfies a quasi-symmetry or\nstrong sector condition, or is symmetrized. See [33] and [28] for these related processes.\n\n3.4. Application to additive functionals of normal Markov chains\nFor additive functionals of normal Markov chains (QQ\u2217 = Q\u2217 Q), the central limit theorem\nbelow is a result of Gordin and Lifshitz [17]. As an application of Theorem 2, we give an\nalternative proof.\nLet \u03c1f be the spectral measure on the closed unit disk D \u2282 C corresponding to the\nfunction f \u2208 L20 (\u03c0).\n\n\f438\n\nM. Gordin and M. Peligrad\n\nProposition 10. Let (\u03bei )i\u2208Z be a stationary normal Markov chain and a function f \u2208\nL20 (\u03c0), satisfying the condition\nZ\n1\n\u03c1f (dz) < \u221e.\n(28)\nD |1 \u2212 z|\nThe martingale approximation (2) then holds.\nProof. According to Theorem 2, we have to verify condition (8). By using spectral\ncalculus as in [3], Chapter 4, after some computations, we get\nn\u22121\n1 X m\nYk\nn\u2192\u221e n\n\n2\n\nlim sup\n\nk=0\n\n2\n\n\u22644\n\nZ\n\nD\n\n|1 + z + * * * + z m\u22121 |2\n\u03c1f (dz)\nm2 |1 \u2212 z|\n\nand condition (8) is therefore satisfied by condition (28) and the dominated convergence\ntheorem.\n\u0003\nCondition (28) has an interesting equivalent formulation in terms of conditional moments that is in the spirit of (and which implies) the Mawxell\u2013Woodroofe condition\n(21).\nRemark 11. Condition (28) is equivalent to\n\u221e\nX\nkE0 (Sk )k2\n2\n\n< \u221e.\n\n(29)\n\nkE0 (Xk )k22 < \u221e.\n\n(30)\n\nk2\n\nk=1\n\nCondition (29) is further implied by\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=1\n\nThe equivalence in the above remark can be found in [4], Lemma 2.1. The fact that\n(30) implies (29) is easily established, much like the proof that (22) implies (21).\n\nAcknowledgements\nMikhail Gordin was supported in part by a Charles Phelps Taft Memorial Fund grant\nand RFBR Grant 10-01-00242 a.
