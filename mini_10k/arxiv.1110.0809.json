Introduction\n\nWhen a heavy quark moves supersonically through plasmas, the energy and momentum are redistributed,\nproducing a Mach cone and diffusion wake. Originally, the study of the Mach cone structure was motivated by\nan attempt to understand the two particle correlation functions measured in the heavy ion collisions. Although\nthe Mach cone failed to explain the experimental observation, it is a simple way to study the medium response\nto an energetic particle.\nUsing the AdS/CFT correspondence, the stress-energy tensor in the strongly coupled SYM plasma due to\na heavy quark have been calculated [1, 2]. In this work, we study the Mach cone produced in the high\ntemperature QCD plasmas at weak coupling and compare it with the strong coupling results given by the\nAdS/CFT correspondence.\n\n2. Linearized Boltzmann Equation at Leading Log\n\nWe start with the Boltzmann equation\n(\u2202t + vp * \u2202x ) f (t, x, p) = C[f, p] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the particle distribution function is linearized around the equilibrium, f (t, x, p) = np + \u03b4f (t, x, p) with\nnp = 1/(ep/T \u2212 1).

At the leading log approximation,\nwe consider only t-channel 2 \u2192 2 scattering. Two hard particles with momenta of order T are scattered into\ntwo others, exchanging soft particles with momenta of order gT , where g is the weak coupling constant. The\nparticles are scattered with angles of order g.

Using the Boltzmann equation with the gain terms, it is easy\nto show that the lost energy and momentum of the excess particles are exactly compensated by the gain terms.\nTherefore, the total energy and momentum are conserved during the evolution.\nIn order to get the boundary condition, we consider the excess of soft gluons within a small ball of radius\n\u2206p \u223c gT centered at p = 0\nZ p=\u2206p 3\nd p\nT2\nnp (1 + np )\u03c7(p) '\n\u03c7(0)\u2206p\n(8)\n3\n(2\u03c0)\n2\u03c0 2\np=0\nwhich is vanishing at the weak coupling limit.

However, the dynamic\nsolution has higher order terms and develops spurious shocks for R < 20.\nIn the AdS/CFT correspondence, even the first order hydrodynamics is good for R & 5. Only the sound\nwave has corrections of the second order static hydrodynamics and is dominant in the energy distribution. At\nR = 5 in the energy density, we can see the improvement given by the second order theory. Both the static and\nthe dynamic solution work very well in Figure 6 (b).\nIn comparison with the AdS/CFT correspondence, the Boltzmann equation produces a smooth transition from\nthe free streaming to the hydrodynamic regime. The stress-energy tensor given by the AdS/CFT correspondence\nis significantly better described by hydrodynamics in the sub-asymptotic regime.
