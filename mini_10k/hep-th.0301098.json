An example of a 7-manifold which representing a R3 bundle\nover a self-dual Einstein space is described and the potential appearing after compactification over the 6-d twistor space is derived.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe compactification of heterotic string theory on a complex three-dimensional CalabiYau space was for a long time the standard way to derive N = 1 Super Yang Mills (SYM)\nin 4 dimensions (or even better the MSSM) from string- or M-theory. In this approach\nnon-Abelian gauge groups as well as chiral matter appear very natural. On the other hand\nin the dual type II or M-theory picture non-Abelian gauge groups and chiral matter come\nfrom singularities or appear on the world volume of D-branes. Concrete N = 1 models\ncould be constructed using intersecting branes at angles, where supersymmetry requires\nthat the branes have to intersect at specific angles [1]. Examples are discussed in [2] and\nnon-supersymmetric brane world models can be found in [3], with massless matter living\non the common intersection of the branes. One can use different branes to build the brane\nworld models, but especially interesting are the 6-branes which uplift to pure geometry in\nthe 11-d M-theory picture. Assuming that the resulting 4-d external space is given by the\nPoincare invariant flat Minkowski space, the 11-d geometry becomes: M11 = M4 \u00d7 M7 .\nNow, the amount of 4-d supersymmetry is directly related to the number (covariantly\nconstant) Killing spinors on M7 , which in turn reduces the holonomy of this space. The\nholonomy of a generic (orientable) 7-d space is given by SO(7) and reduces to G2 if the\nspace allows for exactly one covariantly constant spinor. If the space allows for 2, 4 or even\n8 Killing spinors the holonomy is further reduced to SU(3), SU(2) or becomes trivial, i.e.\nconsist only of the identity. We will be interested in the case with only one Killing spinor\nand thus having a G2 manifold we want to address the question of how one can obtain\nbranes and the corresponding gauge group upon dimensional reduction, see also [4, 5].\n1 Contribution\n\nto the proceedings of the 35th Symposium Ahrenshoop, August 2002.\n\n\f2\n\nBranes from geometry\n\nDp-branes are extended BPS objects that are charged under a (p+1)-form potential. From\nthe Kaluza-Klein reduction one can obtain only a 1-form gauge potential supporting either\na particle (0-brane) or the Hodge-dual a co-dimension 3 brane. In 10 dimensions this is\nthe D6-brane which is obtained by the dimensional reduction from M7 = R3 \u00d7XT N , where\nXT N is the 4-d Taub-NUT space with the metric\n1\nn\nds2 = (d\u03c7 + n cos \u03b8 d\u03c6)2 + V (dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a92 ) , V = 1 + .\n(1)\nV\nr\nFrom this metric the 6-brane with charge n is obtained by dimensional reduction along the\nKilling vector k = \u2202\u03c7 . Equivalently, a charge-n-6-brane can be seen as n 6-branes put on\ntop of each other and hence there is a U(n) world-volume gauge group. Keeping the 4\u03c0periodicity of \u03c7 as for the single brane, this results in a conical singularity, which is nothing\nbut the well known Zn orbifold singularity. For this simple case it is straightforward to\nextract the location and charge of the brane. In fact, often one defines the space in\nterms of orbifold actions, which gives a clear brane content (as orbifold fixed points).\nSometimes however, one wants to read-off the location and charge of the 6-branes directly\nfrom a given 7-d metric where the explicit orbifold action is unclear. Of course, branes\nappear only after dimensional reduction along a given Killing vector k and one finds the\nidentification\nlocation of 6-branes - fixed point set L (i.e. |k|2 = 0) of codimension four\ncharge of 6-branes\n- (inverse) surface gravity \u03ba of L ( \u03ba2 = |\u2207k|2 ) .\nFor the case discussed above one finds |k|2 = V1 and |\u2207k|2 = n1 +O(r) and the relations are\nidentical fulfilled. It is a well-known fact from black hole solutions that a non-vanishing\nsurface gravity (=non-vanishing Hawking temperature) corresponds to case where the\nKilling vector is compact (periodic Euclidean time) and the fixed point set is at finite\ngeodesic distance. In the extreme limit the surface gravity vanishes, the Killing vector\nbecomes non-compact or a translational isometry and the fixed point moves to infinity.\nFor the simple 6-brane configuration from above, there is no regular extreme limit, but\nnote, that if \u03ba = 1 there is no conical singularity and the geometry is locally equivalent\nto the flat space. Since n is an integer, one can resolve the conical singularity by going to\nthe n-center solution and because g\u03c7\u03c7 vanishes at each center, between each two centers\nappear a non-trivial 2-cycle and the resolution of the singularity can also be understood\nas the blowing up of these 2-cycles. This is of course well-known for 6-branes living in flat\nspace, where the corresponding multicenter solution exists, but it may be not possible for\na more general manifold with G2 holonomy (due to the lack of the corresponding moduli).\nLet us also mention, that in addition to co-dimension four singularities, which are\ninterpreted as 6-branes, there can also appear singularities of co-dimension two and six.\nIn general their interpretation is less clear. For the example that we will discuss below,\nco-dimension two singularities do not appear and the co-dimension 6 objects are T-dual\nto NS5-branes.\nWe can also extract the 10-d quantities in detail. Having a Killing vector k = \u2202\u03c7 we\nwrite the 11-d metric as usual\n4\n\n2\n\nds2 = e 3 \u03c6 (d\u03c7 + C\u03bc dx\u03bc )2 + e\u2212 3 \u03c6 ds210\nand the 10-d fields can be expressed only by the Killing vector as\n6k \u03b1 k[\u03b1 \u2202\u03bc k\u03bd]\n4\nk\u03bc\ne 3 \u03c6 = |k|2 , C\u03bc = 2 , F\u03bc\u03bd =\n.\n|k|\n|k|2\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n\fFor the simple example above we find \u03c6 \u223c log |k|2 = \u2212 log V and the RR-1-form becomes\nC = n cos \u03b8 d\u03c6 so that n is in fact related to the 6-brane charge.\n\n3\n\nSeven-manifolds with G2 holonomy\n\nRecall, 7-manifolds with G2 holonomy allow for exactly one covariantly constant Killing\nspinor which can be used to build covariantly constant differential forms as Fn1 ***np =\n\u01ed\u03b3n1 ***np \u01eb. If \u01eb is a commuting pseudo Majorana spinor (with a symmetric charge conjugation matrix) on the 7-d space these p-forms are non-vanishing for p = 0, 3, 4, 7 [6].\nThe 0- and its dual 7-forms are trivial from the geometry point of view, the only nontrivial case is given by the covariantly constant 3-form (and its dual 4-form). In a proper\nparameterization, this form is given by\n\u03a6=\n\n1\n\u03c6\n3! abc\n\nea \u2227 eb \u2227 ec = e1 \u2227 e2 \u2227 e3 + e4 \u2227 e3 \u2227 e5 + e5 \u2227 e1 \u2227 e6 + e6 \u2227 e2 \u2227 e4 +\ne4 \u2227 e7 \u2227 e1 + e5 \u2227 e7 \u2227 e2 + e6 \u2227 e7 \u2227 e3 ,\ni\n= e1 \u2227 e2 \u2227 e3 + ei \u2227 em Jmn\n\u2227 en\n\n(4)\ni\nis the triplet of antiwhere ea (a = 1...7) are the vielbeine of the 7-manifold and Jmn\nselfdual complex structures satisfying the quaternionic algebra\nJ i * J j = \u2212I \u03b4 ij + \u01ebijk J k .\n\n(5)\n\nThe appearance of a triplet of complex structures suggests an embedding of a hyper\nKaehler or quaternionic space in the 7-manifold. In fact, two major classes of G2 manifolds\nare [7]: (i) an R3 bundle over a quaternionic space Q or (ii) an R4 bundle over S3 (where\nR4 can be replaced by a more general hyper Kaehler space [8]). For both cases exist a\nlimit in which the space becomes a cone over a 6-d space Y6 so that the metric can be\nwritten as\nds27 = d\u03c12 + \u03c12 ds2Y .\n(6)\nIn case (i) Y6 is the twistor space related to the quaternionic base space (e.g. Y6 = CP3\nfor Q = S4 or Y6 = U(3)/U(1)3 for Q = CP2 ) and case (ii) gives Y6 = S3 \u00d7 S3 . Obviously,\n\u03c1 = 0 is a co-dimension 7 singularity, where all branes will meet and this is exactly the\npoint where chiral matter is located [5, 9]. Viewed from the 10-d perspective this matter\ncorresponds to open strings stretched between different branes, which become massless\nat the common intersection. In 11 dimensions these open strings become membranes\nwrapping a 2-cycle which terminates at the fixed point of the Killing vector. The kind\nof matter depends crucially on the type of the singularity [5, 9], usually it transforms in\nthe bi-fundamental representation of the gauge group, but also matter transforming in\na tensor as well as tri-fundamental representation has been discussed [10]. In any case,\nthe number of chiral multiplets is related to the second Betti number b2 and for case\n(ii) with Y6 = S3 \u00d7 S3 we will get no chiral multiplets (there can be chiral matter if\nR4 is replace by a more general hyper Kaehler space) whereas for case (i) with Q = S4\nthere is one chiral multiplet and for Q = CP2 gives two chiral multiplets; more general\nquaternionic spaces (see e.g. [11, 12, 13, 14]) will of course yield more chiral multiplet. The\ncase with a single chiral multiplet (i.e. with Q = S4 ) gives in 10 dimensions the situation\nwith two 6-branes, which are connected by the non-trivial 2-cycle. The case yielding\ntwo chiral multiplets describes in 10 dimensions three 6-branes, which exhibits a triality\nsymmetry corresponding to the exchange of the three 6-branes and thus all 6-branes have\n\n\fthe same gauge group on their world volume. More interesting is of course the situation\nwith different gauge groups where each singularity corresponds to a different number of\n6-branes. This brings us to the proposal to use a G2 manifold given as an R3 bundle over\nWCPn1 n2 n3 , which has again b2 = 2 and hence describes three intersecting 6-branes with\ngauge groups related to the weights n1 , n2 and n3 [9]. This space however is known to\nhave further singularities, related to co-dimension 6 fixed points.\n\n4\n\nThe explicit example\n\nThe mathematical literature [14] provides strong evidence that the metric of the metric of\nthe quaternionic space WCPn1 n2 n2 is basically given by a fourth order polynomial where\nthe roots sum to zero, i.e.\nF (x) = \u03ba(x \u2212 r1 )(x \u2212 r2 )(x \u2212 r3 )(x \u2212 r4 ) ,\n\nr1 + r2 + r3 + r4 = 0\n\n(7)\n\nand can be written as\nds24 =\n\nq 2 \u2212 p2 2 p2 \u2212 q 2 2\nF (p)\nF (q)\ndp +\ndq + 2\n(d\u03c4 + q 2 d\u03c3)2 + 2\n(d\u03c4 + p2 d\u03c3)2\n2\nF (p)\nF (q)\nq \u2212p\np \u2212 q2\n\n(8)\n\nand it solves the equations Rmn = 3\u03bagmn . Since the Weyl tensor satisfies W + \u22c6 W = 0\nthese spaces are known in the mathematical literature as (anti) self-dual Einstein spaces.\nWe consider the compact case and write for the curvature parameter \u03ba = 1, but one\ncan of course consider any value. Due to a scaling symmetry, this solution depends\non three continuous and one discrete parameter. In the physics literature this metric\nis known in Minkowski signature (q \u2192 iq and rm \u2192 irm ) as E(A)dS-Kerr-Taub-NUT\nspace [15], where the four parameters have the interpretation as cosmological constant,\nthe rotational parameter and the mass equals the NUT parameter (due to the anti-selfduality constraint). The remaining discrete parameter defines the slicing of the 4-d space\nby a 2-space of constant positive, negative or vanishing curvature.\nThe curvature square of this space is Rmnrs Rmnrs = 24\u03ba2 + 96n2 /(p + q)6 , where\np + q = 0 is a non-removable singularity and n = \u2202x F |x=0 is the mass (=NUT parameter)\nfor Minkowskean solution. By a proper choice of parameter this singularity can however\nbe put into an unphysical coordinate region where the metric has the signature (2,2).\nNote, the space has Euclidean signature only if the two relations hold: F (p) \u2265 q 2 \u2212 p2\nand F (q) \u2265 p2 \u2212 q 2 . With this 4-d base space the 7-d metric reads\ndr 2\n4u0 \u0011\nr2 2\nr2 \u0010\n2\na\na i\nb\nb j\nds =\n1\n\u2212\nh\n(dx\n+\n\u03be\nA\n)(dx\n+\n\u03be\nA\n)\n+\nds ,\n(9)\n+\nab\ni\nj\n0\n4\nr4\n2 4\n(1 \u2212 4u\n)\nr4\ni\nwhere Ai = 12 \u03c9 mn Jmn\nis the anti-self-dual part of the spin connections \u03c9 mn of the 4-d base\na\nspace and \u03bei are three Killing vectors of the S2 -metric hab ; for more details see [13, 12].\nIn the limit where the parameter u0 vanishes, this metric describes in fact a cone over a\n6-d space Y6 , which is topologically an S2 fibered over the 4 dimensional base given by\nthe metric (8).\nThis space has two commuting, tri-holomorphic2 Killing vectors (k1 = \u2202\u03c3 and k2 = \u2202\u03c4 )\nand taking a general linear combination: k = \u03b21 \u2202\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b22 \u2202\u03c3 , 6-branes are related to codimension four fixed point sets. Recall, the fixed point set given by |k|2 = 0 can have\ndifferent co-dimensions and one finds\n2 Which\n\nleaves the triplet of SU (2) connections invariant.\n\n\fco-dimension 7:\nco-dimension 6:\nco-dimension 4:\n\nif u0 = 0 at r = 0 ,\nat |\u03be|2 = 0 and F (p) = F (q) = 0 ,\nif (i) |\u03be|2 = 0 and q 2 = \u03b2\u03b221 = rm (or p2 = \u03b2\u03b212 ) or\nif (ii) F (q) = F (p) = 0 and \u03b21 A2\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b22 A2\u03c3 = 0 .\n\nExplicit calculations show no co-dimension 2 fixed points (or better they are at infinite\ngeodesic distance). The co-dimension 4 singularity has the interpretation as 6-branes and\nand the co-dimension 7 case is related to the appearance of chiral fermions. The codimension 6 singularity is related to a fixed point of both Killing vectors and hence they\ncorrespond to additional NS5-branes in the dual type IIB picture. If one is interested in a\n\"clear\" picture of only 6-branes living in a topologically flat space, one has to \"turn off\"\nthe co-dimension 6 singularities and in this case the number of components of the fixed\npoint set gives the number number of 6-branes [16]. This can be done by equalizing two\nof the roots of the 4th order polynomial, e.g. r1 = r2 and k = r32 \u2202\u03c4 \u2212 \u2202\u03c3 , see [13].\nIn concluding let us stress, because the 7-space is non-compact we cannot simply reduce\nthe model to 4 dimensions, but we can of course reduce it over the compact 6-d space and\nobtain a domain wall solution in 5 dimensions. So, writing the 7-metric as\nds2 = e2\u03c61 (r) dr 2 + e2\u03c62 (r) hab (dxa + \u03beia Ai )(dxb + \u03bejb Aj ) + e2\u03c63 (r) ds24 .\n\n(10)\n\nThe Kaluza-Klein scalars X2,3 parameterize the volumes of the S2 and the quaternionic\nspace and using well-known reduction formulae [17] it is straightforward to derive their\n5-d potential. It is obtained from the Ricci tensor by setting r = constant and reads\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u22122\u03c62\n\u22122\u03c63\n\u2212 34 (\u03c62 +2\u03c63 )\ne\n+ 6\u03bae\n+1\n(11)\nV = 2e\nwhere the first dilatonic term is due to the conformal rescaling necessary to obtain the\n(2)\nEinstein frame and we used that the 2- and 4-dimensional spaces satisfy Rab = hab and\nR(4) = 3\u03bagmn , where we set \u03ba = 1 to have a compact space. Like the potentials coming\nfrom flux compactifications [18] this potential has no fixed points and hence the scalars\ncannot be stabilized yielding a singular domain wall. An extrema for the potential would of\ncourse imply that the solution would contain either an AdS space or becomes flat, which\nis not the case for the explicitly solution given in eqs. (9). Similarly to the approach\ndiscussed in [19] this model should be embeddable into N=2,D=5 gauged supergravity.\n\nAcknowledgment I would like to thank Gianguido Dall'Agata, Dieter L\u00fcst and\nSwapna Mahapatra for the collaboration on this subject.
