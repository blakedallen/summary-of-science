This oscillator\nis based on the technology developed for optical clocks and replaces the quartz based microwave\noscillator commonly used in fountain clocks. As a result, a significant decrease of the frequency\ninstability of the fountain clock is obtained, reaching 0.74 \u00d7 10\u221214 at 100 s averaging time. We\ncould demonstrate that for a significant range of detected atom numbers the instability is limited\nby quantum projection noise only, and that for the current status of this fountain clock the new\nmicrowave source poses no limit on the achievable frequency instability.\nPACS numbers: 06.30.Ft, 42.62.Eh, 42.50.Lc\n\nProgress in important fields of fundamental physics entails the request for better and better clocks [1]. The\nadvent of optical clocks necessitates frequency measurements against caesium fountain clocks, which nowadays\ndeliver the best results for the realization of the SI second in terms of systematic and statistical uncertainty\n[2]. In fountain clocks laser cooled atoms are vertically\ntossed, exposed to two microwave pulses during the ballistic flight and finally detected in a state selective detection process. The microwave frequency is adjusted\nto the atomic transition frequency according to the detection signal. Relative systematic uncertainties below\nthe 10\u221215 -level have already been achieved by several\nfountains [2]. In the best case, frequency instabilities\nare limited by the quantum projection noise [3, 4], resulting in 10\u221216 statistical uncertainties after one day\nof measurement [5]. However, for the majority of fountain clocks the frequency instability is eventually limited\nby the phase noise properties of the employed quartz\noscillators through the Dick effect [6]. This effect results from an aliasing of interrogation oscillator frequency\nnoise components caused by the non-continuous probing\nof the atomic transition frequency in commonly pulsed\nfountains (see e.g. [7]). With the best available quartz\noscillators as \"flywheels\" and for typical fountain duty\ncycles the relative frequency instability is thus limited to\nthe order of 10\u221213 (\u03c4 /s)\u22121/2 , where \u03c4 is the measurement\ntime. A possible, but complex and demanding way to\nessentially avoid a frequency stability degradation due to\nthis effect is the switch to a fountain operating with a\ncontinuous beam of cold atoms [8]. As an elaborate solution for the established pulsed fountains a highly stable\ncryogenic sapphire oscillator [9] has been used as interrogation oscillator, resulting in a fountain frequency instability in the low 10\u221214 (\u03c4 /s)\u22121/2 range [5].\nAnother approach is the employment of an optically\ngenerated microwave [10, 11], for which we use as a flywheel a laser originally set up for use as interrogation\nlaser in the Yb+ frequency standard of the PhysikalischTechnische Bundesanstalt (PTB) [12]. In the experiment\nreported here, this laser is locked to a stable cavity but\n\nnot to the Yb+ ion. This reference laser reaches a shortterm frequency instability of a few times 10\u221215 in 1 s,\nwith a long-term drift of 10\u221216 /s due to the optical cavity. This instability is transferred to a dielectric resonator oscillator (DRO) at a frequency \u03bd DRO = 9.6 GHz\nwhich is our highly stable microwave source for the caesium fountain [13]. A self-referenced fiber-laser femtosecond frequency comb stabilized to a hydrogen maser connects the optical and microwave spectral regions. The\nDRO is phase-locked to the reference laser using the frequency comb as a transfer oscillator [13]. The independently measured frequency instability of the locked DRO\nis 10\u221214 in 1 s, and reaches the level of the reference laser\nafter 10 s.\nFigure 1 is a schematic of the DRO lock and the longterm stabilization of the microwave frequency to the caesium clock transition. The transfer beat frequency \u03bdt results from a direct phase comparison between the DRO\nand the reference laser [13]:\n\u03bdt = \u03bdL /c \u2212 b \u03bd DRO ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bdL = 344 THz is the Yb+ reference laser frequency,\nc a rational division and b an integer multiplication factor (see Fig. 1). A phase-locked loop technique steers\nthe DRO to keep \u03bdt constant at the frequency given by\nsynthesizer A. Synthesizer B and a single-sideband mixer\nshift the DRO frequency to the interrogation frequency\nfor the fountain. A detection and integration process\ngives the correction signal for the microwave frequency.\nA slow proportional-integral (PI) controller drives synthesizer A with a 10 MHz voltage controlled oscillator\n(VCO) via the reference frequency input. This compensates the drift of the reference laser and defines the mean\nfrequency of the DRO. We have utilized this femtosecond\nlaser microwave oscillator (FLMO) instead of the usual\nquartz based microwave oscillator (QBMO) for the interrogation of atoms in the PTB caesium fountain clock\nCSF1 [14].\nIf interrogation oscillator noise contributions can be\nneglected, the frequency instability of a fountain ex-\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Scheme of the setup showing in the upper part the fast\nservo loop for the microwave oscillator utilizing an ultrastable\nlaser and a fiber-laser femtosecond frequency comb (FLFC).\nIn the lower part the slow closed-loop control of the DRO (via\nthe synthesizer A) by the caesium fountain signal is shown.\n\u03bdx : beat note of the mth mode of the FLFC and the reference\nlaser with the mode number m = a \u00d7 b \u00d7 c (a, b : integer\nnumbers; c : rational number); \u03bdceo : offset frequency of the\nFLFC; frep : repetition rate of the FLFC.\n\npressed by the Allan standard deviation is given as (see\ne.g. [4]):\n1\n\u03c3y (\u03c4 ) =\n\u03c0Qat S/N\n\nr\n\nTc\n,\n\u03c4\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the measurement time, Tc the fountain cycle duration, Qat = \u03bd0 /\u2206\u03bd is the atomic quality factor with \u2206\u03bd the width of the Ramsey resonance and \u03bd0\nthe caesium hyperfine frequency. S/N is the signal-tonoise ratio, which is proportional to the square-root of\nthe number of detected atoms Nat = N3 + N4 in case\nof quantum projection noise contributing only. N4 and\nN3 represent the number of detected atoms in the caesium ground state hyperfine levels |F = 4, mF = 0i and\n|F = 3, mF = 0i, respectively.\nWe first use the free running FLMO for applying two\n\u03c0/4-pulses in resonance at a frequency \u03bd = \u03bd0 to the\natoms in CSF1, when the slow closed-loop control of the\nDRO is suspended (see Fig. 1). In this case the influence\nof interrogation oscillator noise on the detected atomic\npopulation is effectively suppressed. For each fountain\ncycle the normalized clock signal S = N4 /(N3 + N4 ) is\nobtained. S corresponds to the amplitude of the central Ramsey fringe and is independent of Nat due to\nthe normalization. By changing the loading time of the\n\nFIG. 2: Signal-to-noise ratio S/N as a function of the squareroot of the detected atom number Nat utilizing the FLMO.\n\u25e6 : 2 \u00d7 \u03c0/4-pulses at \u03bd0 ; \u2022 : 2 \u00d7 \u03c0/2-pulses at \u03bd0 + \u2206\u03bd/2. From\nthe dashed line, which indicates the quantum projection noise\nlimit, we derive that Nat = 1 (in arbitrary units) corresponds\nto a number of \u2248 6000 detected atoms.\n\nmagneto-optical trap used as source of atoms in CSF1,\nthe number of cooled and launched atoms, and thus Nat ,\ncan be varied. For a range of loading times between 0.16 s\nand 3.16 s (Tc = 1.12 s\u20134.12 s), S is recorded during 1000\nfountain cycles. Subsequently the Allan standard deviations \u03c3S (Nat ) of the single S measurements are calculated. For the different loading times we obtain ratios\nS/N = S/\u03c3S (Nat ), which are shown as a function of\nthe square-root of Nat by the open circles in Fig. 2. As\nindicated by the dashed line the S/N -ratios are essentially proportional to the square-root of Nat as it is expected for quantum projection noise contributing only.\nThis confirms that for the given useful range of Nat noise\ncontributions due to the photon shot-noise and the detection system can be neglected in CSF1 [15].\nIn order to check for noise contributions of the FLMO,\nwe compare the latter kind of operation with an operation mode which entails the same quantum projection\nnoise contribution, but is also sensitive to interrogation\noscillator noise. Using the free-running FLMO for applying two \u03c0/2-pulses to the atoms at a frequency detuning\n\u2206\u03bd/2 from resonance results in the same measured signal\nS as in the preceding measurements. Actually this kind\nof operation corresponds to the normal servo-controlled\noperation of CSF1 as a clock where the central Ramsey fringe is alternately probed at frequency detunings\n\u00b1\u2206\u03bd/2 and both, quantum projection and interrogation\noscillator noise, contribute. The resulting S/N -ratios are\ndepicted by the solid black circles in Fig. 2. The fact\nthat both data sets (open and solid black circles) coincide well indicates that for the given useful range of Nat\nthe FLMO does not add any significant noise in the clock\n\n\f3\n\n\u03c3yDick (\u03c4 )\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Calculated (small symbols) and measured (large symbols) Allan standard deviations \u03c3y (1 s) of\nrelative frequency differences y(CSF1-Hmaser) as a function\nof the cycle time Tc for different noise contributions.

The solid lines are for guiding the eye. See text for\nfurther explanations.\n\noperation mode.\nWe now discuss the findings in the case when the\nslow closed-loop control of the DRO is active. The solid\nsquares in Fig. 3 indicate the expected frequency instability \u03c3y (1 s) of CSF1 calculated in the case of negligible interrogation oscillator noise contributions. For this\ncalculation measured S/N -ratios for two resonant \u03c0/4pulses were used as input for Eq. (2). In order to obtain\nS/N -ratios for a range of Nat , the loading time of the\nmagneto-optical trap, and thus Tc was varied. An increasing loading time involves an exponential saturation\nto a maximum of Nat with a time constant of \u2248 1 s. The\ndecrease of \u03c3y (1 s) for cycle times up to 2.4 s results from\nthe dominating effect of the increased S/N -ratio due to\nthe increased atom number Nat accompanying extended\nloading times [see Eq. (2)]. The increase of \u03c3y (1 s) for\ncycle times longer than 2.4 s is due to the now dominating contribution of the square root of the cycle time Tc\nin Eq. (2), as the necessary loading time for increasing\nNat furthermore increases disproportionately.\nWhen CSF1 operates as a frequency standard the\npulsed mode of operation entails a significant amount of\ndead time, mainly caused by the time needed for loading\nand detecting of the atoms, during which the interrogation oscillator frequency is not controlled by the atomic\nresonance signal. This dead time gives rise to a degradation of the fountain frequency instability caused by the\nfrequency noise of the interrogation oscillator (Dick effect). The corresponding contribution to the Allan standard deviation is given by [7]:\n\n=\n\n!1/2\n\u221e\n2\n1 X gm\nf\nS (m/Tc )\n,\n\u03c4 m=1 g02 y\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Syf (m/Tc ) is the one-sided power spectral density\nof the relative frequency fluctuations of the free running\ninterrogation oscillator at Fourier frequencies m/Tc, and\ngm are the Fourier coefficients of the Fourier series expansion of the sensitivity function g(t) [7], which is the\nresponse of the atomic system to a phase step of the interrogation oscillator at time t.\nThe open circles in Fig. 3 show the calculated frequency instability contributions due to the Dick effect\naccording to Eq. (3), when the QBMO is in use for CSF1.\nThe calculation is based on the phase noise data from\nthe test sheet of the actual quartz crystal oscillator employed [16] and the sensitivity function g(t) calculated for\nCSF1. With increasing Tc an increasing number of oscillator phase noise components at small Fourier frequencies\nm/Tc degrade the frequency stability. The triangle down\nsymbols show the quadratic sum of both instability contributions calculated according to Eq. (2) and Eq. (3). A\ncomparison of this calculated \u03c3y (1 s) with frequency instabilities of CSF1 (large triangle up symbols) obtained\nfrom frequency measurements with the QBMO using a\nhydrogen maser as a reference exhibit a good agreement.\nIn Fig. 3 and in the following all frequency instability\ndata given by measurements is obtained by subtracting\nsmall frequency instability contributions of the reference\nmaser by using the three-corner-hat method [17], taking\ninto account the results of simultaneous frequency measurements against a second hydrogen maser.\nIf we now consider the calculated \u03c3yDick (1 s) due to the\nDick effect, when the FLMO is in use for CSF1, we notice that the resulting frequency instability contributions\nshown by the open squares in Fig. 3 are at or even below\n10\u221214 . For this calculation we use the measured phase\nnoise of the FLMO [13] and again g(t), as calculated for\nCSF1. The results suggest that the frequency instability contribution due to the FLMO is negligible compared\nto \u03c3y (1 s) calculated for the case of quantum projection\nnoise contributing only (solid squares in Fig. 3).\nThis is confirmed by measurements of the frequency\nof CSF1 against a hydrogen maser, using the FLMO\nfor the interrogation of the atoms. The resulting measured frequency instabilities of CSF1 alone are depicted\nin Fig. 3 as large open diamonds. The agreement of\nthis experimental data with the expected frequency instability (solid squares in Fig. 3) is conclusive. Using the\nFLMO for the atom interrogation in CSF1 yields a purely\nquantum projection noise limited frequency instability\ndown to 0.74 \u00d7 10\u221213 (\u03c4 /s)\u22121/2 . The uninterrupted frequency measurements used for this evaluation typically\nlasted one day. Continuous measurements of several days\ndemonstrated the reliability of the complete system.\nThe improvement in fountain clock stability is also\ndemonstrated by comparing the measured frequency in-\n\n\f4\nthe solid line shows that the measurement time needed to\nobtain a specific statistical uncertainty of CSF1 is shortened by a factor of 3.2 compared to the case using the\nQBMO. Moreover, in the case of collisional shift measurements which involve the need for operating CSF1 at\nelevated Nat [14] the gain in measurement time can be\neven larger. In order to further lower the frequency instability of CSF1, refined methods for loading more atoms\nin a given time interval, e.g., by loading from a cold beam\nof atoms, need to be installed.\n\nFIG. 4: Measured Allan standard deviations \u03c3y (\u03c4 ) of the\nfrequency of CSF1 using the QBMO (\u25e6) or the FLMO (\u2022)\nfor interrogating the atoms.

This approach avoids the cost of operation of a low-noise cryogenic sapphire oscillator and is\nthus an alternative solution for reducing the frequency\ninstability of fountain clocks. A low instability is indispensable for the evaluation of several systematic uncertainty contributions at the level of 10\u221216 or below.\nMoreover, the statistical uncertainty of frequency measurements of optical clocks using fountain clocks as references is limited by fountain frequency instabilities and\nwill highly benefit from quantum projection noise limited\nfountain instabilities. In fact, the obtained instability of\n0.74 \u00d7 10\u221213 (\u03c4 /s)\u22121/2 enables us to reach a statistical\nuncertainty of 2.5 \u00d7 10\u221216 after one day of measurement.\nWe thank Chr.
