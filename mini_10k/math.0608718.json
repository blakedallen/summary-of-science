We prove a\ntheorem which gives sufficient conditions for Ml to have big monodromy. We apply the theorem\nto explicit systems arising from the middle cohomology of families of hyperelliptic curves and\nelliptic surfaces to show that the monodromy is uniformly big as we vary l and the system.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nGalois theory in its various forms is one of the main and most powerful tool of arithmeticians\nand geometers, and in particular the determination of the Galois group of some field extensions\nor coverings of algebraic varieties (or differential Galois group of some equations) is often both an\nimportant step in solving certain problems and a very interesting question of its own. Whereas\nfinding \"upper bounds\" for those Galois groups can be relatively easy (coming from the existence\nof symmetries that must be preserved), it is usually quite challenging to compute exactly the\nGalois groups. What is expected is that, given the known symmetry constraints, the Galois group\nwill \"usually\" be the largest group preserving those symmetries; indeed, this is often the desired\nconclusion for applications. There are many celebrated results of this type, among which are\nSerre's computations of Galois groups of torsion fields of elliptic curves over number fields [S2],\nKatz's monodromy computations in algebraic geometry leading to equidistribution statements for\nangles of Kloosterman sums [Ka1], and some cases of the inverse Galois problem [Hi], [Sha1].\nIt is desirable to have criteria to compute Galois groups and to show they are \"as big as possible\",\nand it is most important that those criteria involve conditions that can be checked in practice. This\npaper considers an important class of situations where the groups involved are finite orthogonal\nor symplectic groups over Fl . There are quite a few applications where such groups arise, and we\ndescribe the motivating one in section 2. Here is the simplified (and weakened) statement of the\ngroup theoretical criterion we will prove:\n\u2217\n\nDepartment of Mathematics, University of Texas, Austin, TX 78712, USA, cjh@math.utexas.edu\n\n1\n\n\fTheorem 1.1. Let V be an Fl -vector space together with a perfect pairing V \u00d7 V \u2192 Fl and\nlet G \u2264 GL(V ) be an irreducible primitive subgroup which preserves the pairing. If the pairing is\nsymmetric, G contains a reflection and an isotropic shear, and l \u2265 5, then G is one of the following:\n1. the full orthogonal group O(V );\n2. the kernel of the spinor norm;\n3. the kernel of the product of the spinor norm and the determinant.\nIf the pairing is alternating, G contains a transvection, and l \u2265 3, then G is all of the symplectic\ngroup Sp(V ).\nFor group-theoretic terms (e.g. transvection or isotropic shear) see section 3. Rather than assuming\nG is primitive, in which case we could appeal to [Wa1] or [Wa2] (cf. section 6 of [DR]), we make\nexplicit assumptions about a set of elements generating G and show that they (essentially) imply\nG is primitive. In section 3 we also give a full statement of the theorem and its proof, and in the\nlast two sections we give applications. Among those we single out (because it is easy to state and\nto prove) the following (unpublished) theorem of J-K. Yu.\nTheorem 1.2. The mod-l monodromy of hyperelliptic curves is Sp(2g, Fl ) for l > 2.\nSee [Yu] for the preprint containing Yu's original proof or [AP] for another recent independent\nproof. The theorem has been used in several contexts. Yu originally proved his theorem in order\nto study the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics over function fields. Chavdarov [C] applied the theorem to\nstudy the irreducibility of numerators of zeta functions of families of curves over finite fields and\nKowalski used his results to study the torsion fields of an abelian variety over a finite field [Kow2].\nAchter applied Yu's theorem in [Ac] to prove a conjecture of Friedman and Washington on class\ngroups of quadratic function fields.\n\n1.1\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank D. Allcock, N.M. Katz, M. Olsson, D. Ulmer, and J.F. Voloch for several\nhelpful conversations during the course of research and for their interest in this work, and we would\nlike to thank the anonymous referree for carefully reading the paper and making several helpful\nsuggestions for improving the exposition. We would also like to thank E. Kowalski for asking the\nquestion which motivated this paper, for suggesting that we could extend our results, originally for\northogonal monodromy, to symplectic monodromy, and for his generous feedback on earlier drafts\nof this paper. Finally, we must acknowledge the enormous influence of our mentor N.M. Katz. This\npaper would not exist without [Ka3] and we hope that it will serve as a useful complement.\n\n1.2\n\nNotation\n\nWe use the notation n \u226bi1 ,...,im 0 to mean that there is a constant n0 (i1 , . . . , im ) depending on\nthe objects i1 , . . . , im such that n \u2265 n0 (i1 , . . . , im ). In nearly every case the bound can be made\nexplicit, but we usually do not because all that matters is to determine the input objects i1 , . . . , im .\n2\n\n\f2\n\nMotivation and Strategy\n\nLet k be a field, C/k be a proper smooth geometrically-connected curve, K = k(C), and E/K be an\nelliptic curve with non-constant j-invariant. In a recent paper [Kow1], E. Kowalski asked whether\none could prove uniform big Fl -monodromy results for certain sequences of quadratic twists of E\nwhen k = Fq . He went on to show how a sufficiently strong uniform bound (as l varies) would\nallow one to prove a previously untreated variant of Goldfeld's average-rank conjecture, although\nthe type of bounds he required were well beyond known results. One piece of evidence in favor\nof the existence of sufficient bounds was theorem 1.2, an unpublished theorem due to J.-K. Yu.\nRoughly speaking, the key property both situations share is that the monodromy groups arise from\nmiddle cohomology of varieties. One goal of this paper is to complete Kowalski's proof by proving\nbounds of the sort he requires. We will also show how our methods can be used to reprove Yu's\ntheorem.\nA striking aspect of Kowalski's variant is that both q and the degree of the conductor of the\ntwisted curve tend to infinity in constrast with [Ka3] where only q grows. Katz fixes the degree\nof the conductor for the very important reason that he wants to restrict to nice sequences of\ntwists which are all elements of a single nice geometric family. This allows him to bring Deligne's\nequidistribution theorem to bear on a variant of Goldfeld's conjecture by phrasing it in terms of\nmonodromy groups of Ql -sheaves. Kowalski, on the other hand, must contend with an infinite\nsequence of geometric families, and he uses monodromy groups of Fl -sheaves and the \u010cebotarev\ndensity theorem as well as sieve techniques to prove his results. A key difference between the\ntwo approaches is that, for a fixed family of twists, the Ql -monodromy groups are algebraic and\nessentially independent of l while the Fl -monodromy groups are finite and vary with l.\nWe fix a dense affine open U \u2282 C and an algebraic closure k \u2192 k. We fix a geometric point\nx \u2208 U , that is, an embedding Spec(L) \u2192 U for L/k an algebraically-closed extension. We write\n\u03c01 (U ) = \u03c01 (U, x) for the \u00e9tale fundamental group and \u03c01g (U ) for the geometric fundamental group\n\u03c01 (U \u00d7 k) \u2264 \u03c01 (U ). We fix a set \u039b of almost all odd primes l which are invertible in k. For each\nl \u2208 \u039b, we fix a lisse flat Zl -sheaf Ll \u2192 U and let \u03c1l : \u03c01 (U ) \u2192 GLn (Zl ) denote the corresponding\nrepresentation. A priori n depends on l, but we assume the family of representations {\u03c1l,\u03b7 = \u03c1l \u2297Ql }\nis a strictly compatible system in the sense of Serre [S1]; that is, for every l \u2208 \u039b, the characteristic\npolynomials of the Frobenii in \u03c1l,\u03b7 have coefficients in Q and are independent of l. We write\nMl \u2192 U for the lisse Fl -sheaf Ll \u2297Zl Fl \u2192 U and say that the family {Ml \u2192 U } is a (strictly)\ncompatible system.\nFor each l, we write Gal \u2264 GLn (Fl ) for the image (\u03c1l \u2297 Fl )(\u03c01 (U )) and Ggl \u2264 Gal for the image\nof \u03c01g (U ). A priori Gal may be any subgroup of GLn (Fl ), but if we consider additional arithmetic\ninformation, then we may be able to deduce that Gal lies in a proper subgroup \u0393al \u2264 GLn (Fl ). For\nexample, if there is a non-degenerate pairing Ml \u00d7 Ml \u2192 Fl (m) for some Tate twist Fl (m) \u2192 U ,\nthen we say Ml is self dual and we may define \u0393al to be the subgroup of similitudes for the pairing\nwhose determinants are powers of q m . One can prove a similar geometric statement: if Ml is self\ndual and we define \u0393gl \u2264 \u0393al to be the subgroup of isometries of the pairing, then Ggl lies in \u0393gl .\nIn this paper we will assume Ml is self dual and \u0393l = \u0393gl \u2264 GLn (Fl ) is the corresponding isometry\ngroup as above for every l \u2208 \u039b. We will also assume the pairing Ml \u00d7 Ml \u2192 Fl (m) is either always\nsymmetric or always anti-symmetric, hence \u0393l is orthogonal or symplectic respectively; recall l is\nodd. We say Ml has big monodromy if n = rk(Ml ) > 1 and Gl = Ggl contains the derived group\n\n3\n\n\fD\u0393l = [\u0393l , \u0393l ]. If \u0393l is an orthogonal group, then D\u0393l is the intersection of the kernel of the\ndeterminant and the kernel of the spinor norm and has index four. If \u0393l is a symplectic group,\nthen \u0393l = D\u0393l . In particular, if we write \u039bbig for the l \u2208 \u039b where Ml has big monodromy, then in\neither case the index of Gl in \u0393l is uniformly bounded for l \u2208 \u039bbig and \u039b \u2212 \u039bbig is finite, which are\nthe sort of properties Kowalski wants (see (16) of [Kow1]).\nRemark: A priori we could relax the definition of \u039bbig to include all l \u2208 \u039b such that Gl has\nindex at most b in \u0393l for some fixed b, but we note that the two definitions are in fact the same\nfor min{l, n} \u226bb 0. More precisely, the index of the largest proper subgroup of D\u0393l grows with\nmin{l, n} (see table 5.2.A of [KL]), so if min{l, n} \u226bb 0, then there is no proper subgroup of D\u0393l\nof index at most b.\nOne of the simplest examples of a compatible system with big monodromy can be constructed\nfrom the l-torsion of our elliptic curve E/K from above (cf. section 5.1). Then Gal is the Galois\ngroup of K(E[l])/K, Ggl is the Galois group of kK(E[l])/kK, and the function-field analogue of\nSerre's theorem implies Gl = \u0393l for almost all l; note \u0393l \u2243 Sp2 (Fl ) \u2243 SL2 (Fl ). If we write g(C)\nfor the genus of C and l \u226bg(C) 0, then Gl = \u0393l by theorem 1.1 of [CH]. We note that this strong\nuniformity was a crucial ingredient in the proof of theorem 1.2 of that paper.\nA more general example is to fix an abelian variety A/K of higher dimension with trivial K/k-trace\nand consider the compatible system constructed from the l-torsion. If we restrict the endomorphism\nring and dimension of A, then theorem 3 of [S3] implies l \u2208 \u039bbig for l \u226bA 0, but little seems to\nbe known in general otherwise. In particular, if we fix the genus of C and bound the dimensions\nof A and its K-endomorphism ring, then we do not know if \u039bbig may be chosen independently of\nA. We suspect that already for C = P1 and dim(A) \u226b 0 that no uniform bound exists because,\nroughly speaking, the corresponding 'modular varieties' are large and for arbitrarily large l could\nconceivably contain at least one line.\nFor general systems it is natural to ask how big \u039bbig is (cf. 10.7? of [S4]). The answer is interesting\nonly if the Zariski closure of \u03c1l,\u03b7 (\u03c01g (U )) in GLn (Ql ) is itself big in an appropriate sense for any\n(and hence every) l \u2208 \u039b, so we assume it is. Then one can often use general methods to show that\n\u039bbig has Dirichlet density one (see [L]) or even that it contains almost all l (see [MVW], [N] or [S3]).\nHowever, the subset of l \u2208 \u039bbig which these methods yield can be difficult to describe or control, and\nin Kowalski's case they are insufficient (see discussion at end of section 5 of [Kow1]). In particular,\nif we let the rank n tend to infinity, then these methods force us to restrict to l \u226bn 0 where the\nimplicit lower bound for l tends to infinity with n (e.g. so that one can apply characteristic zero\narguments).\nThe main goal of this paper is to demonstrate how one can prove lower bounds for \u039bbig without\nthis restriction. The strategy we use to achieve this is to show Gl is an irreducible subgroup of\n\u0393l and then to apply theorem 3.1 where we give sufficient criteria, in terms of a set of generators,\nfor an irreducible subgroup to contain D\u0393l . More precisely, we show that the subgroup Rl \u2264 Gl\ngenerated by the pseudoreflections is also irreducible and use the classifications in [ZS1] and [ZS2]\nto show that D\u0393l \u2264 Rl .\nFor our first application we return to our last example from above and let \u039b be the set of all odd\nprimes l which are invertible in K. We also let C = P1 and let A/K be the Jacobian of a curve\nin a special class of hyperelliptic curves constructed in section 4, and in theorem 4.1 we reprove\nYu's theorem and show that \u039b = \u039bbig . Katz has pointed out that the key ideas used in the proof\ngeneralize to tamely ramified compatible systems arising from the middle cohomology of the fibers\n4\n\n\fof a Lefschetz pencil X \u2192 A1 of odd relative dimension, where A1 = P1 \u2212 {\u221e}. Moreover, in this\ncase one does not need the full power of theorem 3.1 to show that \u039bbig = \u039b, but instead one can\nappeal directly to the main theorem of [ZS2].\nThe real power of theorem 3.1 emerges only when we consider more general compatible systems.\nFor example, in section 5 we examine systems arising from families of quadratic twists of the elliptic\ncurve E/K when K = Fq (t). We recall the construction due to Katz [Ka3] of an affine variety\nFd /Fq which parametrizes quadratic twists of E/K by a 'dense open' subset of the square-free\npolynomials in Fq [t] of degree d. We also construct, for each l, the orthogonally self-dual lisse\nFl -sheaf Td,l \u2192 Fd whose fibers encode the reduction modulo l of the (unitarized) L-function of\nthe corresponding twists (cf. section 5.1); it corresponds to a Tate twist of the Ql -sheaf constructed\nby Katz. He proved that the Ql -monodromy is big if d \u226bE 0 (cf. theorem 1.4.3 of loc. cit.), and\nwe prove something similar in theorem 5.3: if l \u2265 5 and d \u226bE 0, then l \u2208 \u039bbig .\nThe strategy we follow to prove theorem 5.3 is to show that the monodromy of the restriction to\nsome one-parameter family is big. More precisely, for each g \u2208 Fd\u22121 we construct a dense open\nUg \u2282 A1 and a non-constant map jg : Ug \u2192 Fd for which the pullback jg\u2217 Td,l \u2192 Ug has big\nmonodromy. Up to replacing E/K by the quadratic twist Eg /K and shrinking Ug , this reduction\namounts to restricting to the one-parameter family of twists by c\u2212 t where c \u2208 Ug . We apply Katz's\ntheory of middle convolution to analyze the mondoromy of such a family, and in theorem 5.4 we\nshow that jg\u2217 Td,l has big monodromy if l \u2265 5 and d \u226bj(E) 0, where j(E) is the j-invariant of E. In\nparticular, as we vary d, g the collection of compatible systems {jg\u2217 Td,l \u2192 Ug } suffices for Kowalski's\npurposes.\nWe note that one can prove similar results for quadratic twists of more general systems for C of\narbitrary genus. Fix a dense open V \u2282 C and a self-dual compatible system {Kl \u2192 V } such that,\nfor each l \u2208 \u039b, the sheaf Kl \u2192 V is tame, irreducible, and the monodromy around at least one\ngeometric point of C \u2212V is pseudoreflection. We can construct, for each divisor D > 0 supported on\nC \u2212 V , a parameter space FD /Fq of functions which is a 'dense open' subset of the Riemann-Roch\nspace of D (cf. section 5.0 of [Ka3]) and a corresponding compatible system {TD,l \u2192 FD }. The\nfibers of TD,l \u2192 FD are the quadratic twists of Kl \u2192 V and the system {TD,l \u2192 FD } is self-dual\nof the symmetry type opposite that of {Kl \u2192 V }. If we fix a sufficiently nice map t : C \u2192 P1\nwhose polar divisor is [e]D for some e, then one can argue as above to show T[de]D,l \u2192 F[de]D has\nbig monodromy for l, d \u226bD 0.\n\n3\n\nSubgroups of Finite Symplectic and Orthogonal Groups\n\nThroughout this section we fix an odd prime l and a vector space V over Fl together with a nondegenerate bilinear pairing. We assume that the pairing is either symmetric or alternating, and in\nthe first case we also add the assumption that l \u2265 5. We write hw, vi for the pairing of w, v \u2208 V\nand for a subspace W \u2264 V we write W \u22a5 for the orthogonal complement of V and Rad(W ) for the\nintersection W \u2229 W \u22a5 . We write \u0393 \u2264 GL(V ) for the subgroup preserving the pairing. If the pairing\nis symmetric (resp. alternating), then we write \u0393 = O(V ) (resp. \u0393 = Sp(V )).\nGiven an element \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 we write V \u03b3=a for the subspace of V on which \u03b3 acts as the scalar a \u2208 F\u00d7\nl ,\nV \u03b3 for V \u03b3=1 , and V\u03b3 for (\u03b3 \u2212 1)V . We define the drop of an element \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 to be the codimension of\nthe invariant subspace V \u03b3=1 . If \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 is an element of drop 1, we say it is a reflection if det(\u03b3) = \u22121\n5\n\n\fand a transvection if det(\u03b3) = 1. In either case we call \u03b3 a pseudoreflection and a non-zero element\nof (V \u03b3=1 )\u22a5 a root; the latter spans V\u03b3 = (V \u03b3=1 )\u22a5 . We call a non-trivial element \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393 an isotropic\nshear if it is unipotent and (\u03c3 \u2212 1)2 = 0, and we note that the image of \u03c3 \u2212 1 is a non-trivial\nisotropic subspace of V and necessarily dim(V ) \u2265 4 when the pairing on V is symmetric.\nRemark: If the pairing on V is symmetric and drop(\u03c3) = 2, then what we call an isotropic shear is\nsometimes called a Siegel transvection. We use the term shear in order to avoid confusion with what\nwe call a transvection. It is an elementary exercise to show that there are no (usual) transvections\nin the case \u0393 = O(V ).\nRemark: What we call an isotropic shear is a quadratic element in the sense of Thompson [T].\nWe say a subgroup G \u2264 \u0393 is irreducible if V is an irreducible G-representation. We say G is\nimprimitive if V , as a G-representation, is induced from a proper subgroup of G and otherwise we\nsay G is primitive. We note G is imprimitive if and only if there is a non-trivial subspace W < V\nsuch V decomposes as a direct sum \u2295G/H gW of the G-translates gW over all cosets gH (cf. section\n12.D of [CR]).\nWe devote the rest of this section to the proof of the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.1. Let r \u2265 1 and suppose G \u2264 \u0393 is an irreducible subgroup together with a set of\ngenerators S \u2282 G and a subset S0 \u2282 S satisfying the following properties:\n1. drop(\u03b3) \u2264 r for every \u03b3 \u2208 S;\n2. every \u03b3 \u2208 S \u2212 S0 has order prime to (r + 1)! or is a pseudoreflection;\n3. 2(r + 1)|S0 | \u2264 dim(V ).\nIf the pairing is symmetric and G contains a reflection and an isotropic shear, then G is one of the\nfollowing:\n1. the full orthogonal group O(V );\n2. the kernel of the spinor norm;\n3. the kernel of the product of the spinor norm and the determinant.\nIf the pairing is alternating and G contains a transvection, then G is all of Sp(V ).\nRemark: The subgroups of O(V ) enumerated above are the subgroups of index at most two\nexcluding SO(V ).\nIf the pairing on V is symmetric, then G contains one or more reflections, each of which has\ndeterminant \u22121. Otherwise the pairing is alternating and G contains one or more transvections.\nWe write R E G for the normal subgroup generated by all pseudoreflections. It is a non-trivial,\nalthough a priori it might be a proper subgroup of G. Our proof will show that it satisfies the\nconclusions of the theorem, hence so does G.\nWhile one can given explicit formulas for pseudoreflections in terms of the pairing and roots, it is\nnot necessary for what follows. For a fixed pseudoreflection \u03b3 \u2208 R most of the information about\n6\n\n\f\u03b3 is contained in the proper subspaces V\u03b3 , V \u03b3 < V . These spaces satisfy the key identity V\u03b3\u22a5 = V \u03b3\nand h\u03b3i \u2264 R contains every pseudoreflection in R with the same (one-dimensional) root subspace.\nIf the pairing is symmetric, then \u03b3 is semisimple and V\u03b3 = V \u03b3=\u22121 , hence V = V\u03b3 \u2295 V \u03b3 . Otherwise \u03b3\nis unipotent and it perserves the flag 0 < V\u03b3 < V \u03b3 < V ; the same statement is true for an isotropic\nshear.\nLemma 3.2. If W \u2264 V is a non-trivial\nL irreducible R-submodule and H = NG (W ) \u2264 G is the\nstabilizer, then Rad(W ) = 0 and V = G/H gW.\n\nProof. Every G-translate gW is an R-submodule because R is a normal subgroup of G. Some\npsuedoreflection \u03b3 acts non-trivially\non W because otherwise R = gRg\u22121 would act trivially on\nP\ngW , hence on all of V = gW , which is impossible. Therefore the subspace of W spanned by the\nroots contained in W is non-trivial. It is also an R-submodule, hence must be all of W , because\nthe conjugate of a pseudoreflection\nis a pseudoreflection and so R permutes the roots in W . Thus\nP\nwe may write W = \u03b3 W\u03b3 where \u03b3 varies over the pseudoreflections in R and W\u03b3 = W \u2229 V\u03b3 .\nIf \u03b3 acts non-trivially on W , then W\u03b3\u22a5 = V\u03b3\u22a5 = V \u03b3 . Therefore, if we write S \u2264 R\nP for the\nsubgroup generated by all pseudoreflections \u03b3 which act non-trivially on W , then W = \u03b3\u2208S W\u03b3\nand W \u22a5 = \u2229\u03b3 V \u03b3 = V S . In particular, Rad(W ) = W \u2229 W \u22a5 = W \u2229 V S is the proper, hence trivial,\nR-submodule W S . This proves the first part of the lemma.\n\nIf gW 6= W and \u03b3 is a pseudoreflection, then W\u03b3 \u2229 (gW )\u03b3 = 0 because W \u2229 gW = 0. Moreover, if \u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u22a5\nS\n\u22a5\nacts non-trivially\nP on W , then W\u03b3 = V\u03b3 and gW lies in V = W\u03b3 . Therefore gW lies in V = W\nbecause W = \u03b3 W\u03b3 , hence in general g1 W \u22a5 g2 W if and only if g1 W 6= g2 W . In particular, the\nsum of any proper subset of G-translates lies in the complement of any unused G-translate, hence\nthe sum cannot be all of V . Therefore V decomposes as the direct sum of all G-translates and, in\nparticular, V = \u2295G/H gW because g1 W = g2 W if and only if g1 H = g2 H.\nOur main interest in lemma 3.2 is that it allows us to prove the following lemma, which in turn\nwill allow us to use classification results about irreducible subgroups of GL(V ) generated by pseudoreflections.\nLemma 3.3. R is irreducible.\nRemark: The argument we give below was inspired by an argument of Katz for Ql -monodromy\n(1.6.4 of [Ka3]).\nProof. Let W \u2264 V and H \u2264 G be as in the statement of lemma 3.2. If dim(W ) \u2265 r + 1, then,\nfor every \u03b3 \u2208 S, the intersection V \u03b3 \u2229 W is non-trivial because drop(\u03b3) \u2264 r, hence \u03b3W = W ;\nnote, \u03b31 W = \u03b32 W if and only if g1 H = g2 H, otherwise \u03b31 W \u2229 \u03b32 W = 0 (cf. (12.26) of [CR]).\nTherefore W is stabilized by G because S generates G, hence W = V by the irreducibility of G. On\nthe other hand, we cannot have dim(W ) \u2264 r because otherwise we will show that it would imply\ndim(V ) < 2(r + 1) * |S0 |, contrary to the hypotheses of theorem 3.1. To prove this we need two\nlemmas.\nLemma 3.4. For every \u03b3 \u2208 S, if {gi W } is a subset of at least (r + 1)/ dim(W ) G-translates, then\n{gi W } contains a h\u03b3i-orbit.\n\n7\n\n\fL\nProof. The subspace i gi W is at least (r + 1)-dimensional, so it intersects V \u03b3 non-trivially. Suppose v 6= 0 lies in the intersection. The non-empty subset of translates in {gi W } such that the\nprojection of v onto gi W is non-trivial is h\u03b3i-stable, hence it is a union of h\u03b3i-orbits.\nFor any \u03b3 \u2208 S we say a h\u03b3i-orbit in {gW } is non-trivial if it has at least two elements. If \u03b3 is a\npseudoreflection, then every h\u03b3i-orbit is trivial because every G-translate gW is an R-module and\n\u03b3 \u2208 R. If \u03b3 \u2208 S \u2212 S0 is not a pseudoreflection, then a non-trivial h\u03b3i-orbit would have to contain\nat least r + 2 elements, which is impossible by lemma 3.4. Therefore h\u03b3i acts trivially on {gW } for\nevery \u03b3 \u2208 S \u2212 S0 .\nLemmaP\n3.5. Suppose dim(W ) \u2264 r and \u03b3 \u2208 S0 . If the ith h\u03b3i-orbit in {gW } has ei elements, then\ndim(W ) i (ei \u2212 1) < r + 1.\n\nProof. This follows immediately by considering any subset of {gW } containing at most ei \u2212 1\nelements from the ith orbit. In particular, such a subset contains no h\u03b3i-orbit, hence lemma 3.4\nimplies it has less than (r + 1)/ dim(W ) elements.\nBy applying lemma 3.5 to \u03b3 \u2208 S0 and the set of non-trivial h\u03b3i-orbits in {gW } we conclude that\nthere are less than (r + 1)/ dim(W ) non-trivial h\u03b3i-orbits and they have less than 2(r + 1)/ dim(W )\nelements in total. In particular, the union of all such orbits for all \u03b3 \u2208 S0 has less than 2(r +\n1)|S0 |/ dim(W ) elements. On the other hand, S generates G and G is irreducible, so every conjugate\ngW lies in a non-trivial orbit for some \u03b3 \u2208 S0 , hence dim(V ) < 2(r + 1)|S0 |. Therefore W = V .\nIf the pairing on V is alternating, then lemma 3.2 together with the main theorem of [ZS2] imply\nthat R = Sp(V ); for dim(V ) = 2 this is a well-known result of [D]. Therefore we may assume R is\ngenerated by reflections and apply the classification of irreducible reflection groups in [ZS1]. There\nare a handful of exceptional groups, but the key to eliminating them is to find a pair of reflections\nsuch that the order of their product is sufficiently large.\nLemma 3.6. There are conjugate reflections \u03c1, \u03c3\u03c1\u03c3 \u22121 \u2208 R such that [\u03c1, \u03c3] = \u03c1\u03c3\u03c1\u03c3 \u22121 has order at\nleast l.\nProof. First, we claim that for every isotropic shear \u03c3 \u2208 G there is a reflection \u03c1 \u2208 R such that\n\u03c1\u03c3 6= \u03c3\u03c1. For the roots of all reflections in R span V by the irreducibility of R and we claim\n\u03c1\u03c3 = \u03c3\u03c1 if and only if V\u03c1 \u2264 V \u03c3 . In particular, at least one root does not lie in V \u03c3 and so the\ncorresponding reflection satisfies \u03c1\u03c3 6= \u03c3\u03c1 as claimed. To prove the claim we observe that V\u03c1 \u2264 V \u03c3\nand V\u03c3 \u2264 V \u03c1 are dual, with respect to the pairing, hence both statements hold or neither does.\nThe first implies that (\u03c3 \u2212 1)(\u03c1 \u2212 1) = 0 in End(V ) and the second that (\u03c1 \u2212 1)(\u03c3 \u2212 1) = 0. If both\nhold, then clearly \u03c3\u03c1 = \u03c1\u03c3. Conversely, if \u03c1\u03c3 = \u03c3\u03c1, then \u03c1\u03c3(r) = \u2212\u03c3(r) for any root r \u2208 V\u03c1 , hence\n\u03c3 stabilizes V\u03c1 and its restriction acts trivially, so V\u03c1 \u2264 V \u03c3 .\nNext, fix any pair \u03c1, \u03c3 which do not commute, a root z of \u03c1, and y \u2208 V \u03c3 \\V H . Note, z 6\u2208 V \u03c3\nbecause V\u03c1 6\u2264 V \u03c3 , so y, z are independent. Rescaling y if necessary we may assume \u03c1y = y + z. We\nclaim that x = \u03c3z \u2212 z lies in V H and hence x, y, z span a three-dimensional H-submodule W . By\ndefinition x lies in the isotropic subspace V\u03c3 \u2264 V \u03c3 , hence h x , x i = 0, and to show that it lies in\nV \u03c1 it suffices to show h x , z i = 0. Using the identities h x , x i = 0 and h \u03c3z , \u03c3z i = h z , z i one\neasily deduces that h \u03c3z , z i = h z , z i, hence h x , z i = h \u03c3z , z i \u2212 h z , z i = 0 as claimed.\n8\n\n\fFinally, in terms of the ordered basis x, y, z\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0\n1 0 0\n\u03c1 = \uf8ed 0 1 1 \uf8f8, \u03c3 = \uf8ed 0 1\n1 0\n0 0 \u22121\n\nof W we have\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n1 0 0\n0\n0 \uf8f8, \u03c1\u03c3\u03c1\u03c3 \u22121 = \uf8ed 1 1 0 \uf8f8 \u2208 GL(W ).\n\u22122 0 1\n1\n\nThus the restriction u of [\u03c1, \u03c3] to W satisfies (u \u2212 1)l = 0, hence u has order l and the lemma\nfollows.\nApplying lemma 3.6 to the classification in [ZS1] we find either [O(V ) : R] \u2264 2 or R is imprimitive.\nIn their notation the two families of imprimitive groups we must rule out are G(m, m, n) and\nG(2m, m, n), where n = dim(V ). The first is the subgroup of GL(V ) generated by the permutation\nmatrices and the diagonal matrix with diagonal (\u03b6, 1/\u03b6, . . . , 1), where \u03b6 is a primitive mth root\nof unity in F\u00d7\nl and m > 1. The second is the group generated by G(2m, 2m, n) and the diagonal\nmatrix with diagonal (\u22121, 1, . . . , 1). We can eliminate all the imprimitive groups but G(2, 2, n) and\nG(2, 1, n) using the following lemma.\nLemma 3.7. If G(m, m, n) \u2264 O(V ), then m = 2. If G(2m, m, n) \u2264 O(V ), then m = 1.\nProof. G(2m, 2m, n) is a subgroup of G(2m, m, n), hence the first statement of the lemma implies\nthe second. Let \u03c0 be any permutation matrix in O(V ) relative to some basis {xi } of V . Then\nh \u03c0xi , \u03c0xj i = h xi , xj i, hence h xi , xj i = a\u03b4ij +b(1\u2212\u03b4ij ) for some constants a, b \u2208 Fl , where \u03b4ij is the\nKronecker delta function. Let M \u2208 O(V ) be a diagonal matrix whose diagonal is (\u03b6, 1/\u03b6, 1, . . . , 1),\nwhere \u03b6 is a primitive mth root of unity. We see that b = 0 because b = h M x1 , M x3 i =\n\u03b6h x1 , x3 i = \u03b6b and \u03b6 2 = 1 because a = h M x1 , M x1 i = \u03b6 2 a.\nTo eliminate the two remaining imprimitive groups we note that the product of any pair of rotations\nin either of these groups has order at most 4, hence we can eliminate them using lemma 3.6.\nTherefore the only possibilities for R remaining are the groups of index at most two in O(V ) which\nare not SO(V ), which completes the proof of the theorem.\n\n4\n\nA Theorem of Yu\n\nLet q be an odd prime power, C = P1 over Fq and K be the global field Fq (C) = Fq (t). Fix g \u2265 1\nand a monic square-free f (x) \u2208 Fq [x] of degree 2g.\nLet X/K be the hyperelliptic curve which is the natural (one-point) compactification of the affine\ncurve y 2 = (t \u2212 x)f (x). The Jacobian J/K of X is a g-dimensional abelian variety and for any\nrational prime l not dividing q we write J[l] for the subgroup of l-torsion. The main goal of this\nsection is to prove the following theorem due to Jiu-Kang Yu [Yu].\nTheorem 4.1. If l is odd, then the group Gl = Gal(K(J[l])/K) is as big as possible. More\nprecisely, there is a primitive lth root of unity \u03b6l \u2208 K(J[l]) and K(J[l])/K(\u03b6l ) is a geometric\nextension with Galois group \u0393l = Sp(2g, Fl ).\nRemark: For g = 1 the theorem is equivalent to Igusa's theorem [I] for the so-called Legendre\ncurve.\n9\n\n\fOur proof, which will occupy the remainder of this section, differs from the proof in [Yu] and has\nthe advantage that the techniques used allow one to prove more general results.\nBy the existence of the Weil pairing we know that \u03bcl \u2282 K(J[l]), so to prove the theorem we may\nmake the finite scalar extension where we replace K by K(\u03bcl ). If we fix an isomorphism \u03bcl \u2243 Fl ,\nthen the group law together with the Weil pairing gives J[l] the structure of a 2g-dimensional\nFl -vector space together with a non-degenerate alternating pairing. Therefore if we choose a basis\nof J[l], then we may identify Gl with a subgroup of \u0393l and we must show that Gl = \u0393l .\nLet X \u2192 C denote the minimal regular model of X/K and J \u2192 C the N\u00e9ron model of J/K. The\nfibers of X \u2192 C are proper smooth curves of genus g over the open complement j : U \u2192 C of the\nfinite subset Z = {\u03c4 \u2208 Fq : f (\u03c4 ) = 0} \u222a {\u221e}, and each fiber of X \u2192 Z \u2212 {\u221e} is smooth away from\nan ordinary double point (i.e. Lefschetz). In particular, the restriction of J \u2192 C to A1 = C \u2212 {\u221e}\nhas semistable reduction. Over \u221e the fibers of X, J are more difficult to describe, but we will show\nthey are sufficiently 'tame' and that we can ignore them.\nMultiplication by l on J extends to an isogeny of C-group schemes \u00d7l : J \u2192 J and we define\nJl \u2282 J to be the kernel. The latter is a quasi-finite \u00e9tale group scheme over C and the restriction\nJl \u2192 U is finite \u00e9tale. If we write \u03c0 : X \u2192 U for the restriction of X \u2192 C, then (the sheaf of\nsections of) Jl \u2192 C is isomorphic to the direct image sheaf j\u2217 R1 \u03c0\u2217 \u03bcl . More precisely, the fiber of\nR1 \u03c0\u2217 \u03bcl \u2192 U over a geometric point \u03c4 \u2208 U is the \u00e9tale cohomology group H 1 (C\u03c4 , \u03bcl ) = Jl (Fq (\u03c4 ))\nand the adjunction map j\u2217 R1 \u03c0\u2217 \u03bcl \u2243 j\u2217 j \u2217 Jl \u2192 Jl is an isomorphism.\nWe fix a geometric generic point \u03c4 \u2208 U (i.e. an algebraic closure K/K) and let \u03c01 (U ) = \u03c01 (U, \u03c4 )\ndenote the \u00e9tale fundamental group. The lisse sheaf Jl \u2192 U corresponds to a Fl -representation of\n\u03c01 (U ) on the fiber (Jl )\u03c4 = J[l] (which is defined up to inner automorphism). More precisely, if we\nwrite GK = Gal(K/K), then the quotient GK \u2192 Gl factors through GK \u2192 \u03c01 (U ). In fact, the\nfollowing lemma implies \u03c01 (U ) \u2192 Gl factors through the maximal tame quotient \u03c01 (U ) \u2192 \u03c01t (U ).\nLemma 4.2. Jl \u2192 C is tamely ramified.\nProof. The extension K(J[2])/K is a scalar extension hence unramified and by Kummer theory\nK(J[4])/K(J[2]) is tamely ramified, hence K(J[4])/K is tamely ramified. Raynaud's criterion for\nsemi-stable reduction implies J has semi-stable reduction over L = K(J[4]) (cf. 4.7 of [G2]), hence\nL(J[l])/L is tamely ramified and thus so is K(J[l])/K.\nWe fix an algebraic closure Fq \u2192 Fq and let \u03c01t (U \u00d7 k) \u2264 \u03c01t (U ) denote the geometric subgroup. If\nwe order the points in Z \u00d7 k, then for each c \u2208 Z \u00d7 k we may choose a topological generator \u03c3c of\nthe inertia group I(c) \u2264 \u03c01t (U \u00d7 k) so that the ordered product is the identity (cf. [G1] or [SGA1]).\nMoreover, \u03c01t (U \u00d7 k) is topologically generated by \u03c3c for c \u2208 Z \u00d7 k \u2212 {\u221e}, hence to prove the\ntheorem it suffices to show that the images of these elements generate \u0393l which we will do using\ntheorem 3.1. We note that it follows K(J[l])/K is geometric (i.e. k \u2229 K(J[l]) = k) because the\nimage of \u03c01t (U ) in \u0393l lies between the image of \u03c01t (U \u00d7 k) and \u0393l , hence is \u0393l .\nThe Picard-Lefschetz formulas imply that \u03c3c acts as a (symplectic) transvection on J[l] for every\nc \u2208 Z \u00d7 k \u2212 {\u221e} (cf. theorem III.4.3 of [FK]). One can also use Katz's theory of middle convolution\n[Ka2] for Fl -sheaves to deduce the same thing as well as to give another proof of lemma 4.2. More\nimportantly, one can also show that Jl \u2192 C is irreducible (i.e. \u03c01t (U \u00d7 k) acts irreducibly on J[l]).\n\n10\n\n\fThe key is to identify Jl \u2192 C with the middle convolution MC\u22121 (L\u03c7(f (x)) ) which is irreducible (see\nnext section for notation and details).\nTo complete the proof of theorem 4.1 we let \u0393 = \u0393l , G = Gl , r = 1, S = {\u03c3c : c \u2208 Z \u00d7 k \u2212 {\u221e}},\nand S0 = \u2205 and apply theorem 3.1. Note the image of \u03c3c in Gl has prime order l > 2 for every\nc \u2208 Z \u00d7 k \u2212 {\u221e}.\n\n4.1\n\nMiddle Convolution\n\nLet C = P1 , K = k(x), and assume k = k. Let F \u2192 C be a tame quasi-finite \u00e9tale sheaf with\ncoefficients in Fl . We say F is N\u00e9ron if there is a dense open set j : U \u2192 C so that the restriction\nF \u2192 U is lisse and the adjunction map j\u2217 j \u2217 F \u2192 F is an isomorphism. Let M denote the collection\nof irreducible N\u00e9ron F \u2192 C such that the generic rank of F is at least two or the restriction\nF \u2192 C \u2212 {\u221e} has at least two ramified fibers. If U \u2282 C \u2212 {0, \u221e} is dense open, then let MU\ndenote the subset of F \u2208 M such that the restriction F \u2192 U is lisse and let rk(F) denote the\nrank of F \u2192 U . Moreover, if t \u2208 C \u2212 U , then let F(t) denote the representation of I(t) \u2264 \u03c01t (U )\ncorresponding to F \u2192 U . We fix an ordering of C \u2212 U and topological generators \u03c3t \u2208 I(t) for\nt \u2208 C \u2212 U so that the ordered product is the identity in \u03c01t (U ).\n\u00d7\nIf \u03bb \u2208 F\u00d7\nl has order invertible in k and t \u2208 C \u2212U , then we write \u03bb : I(t) \u2192 Fl for the representation\n\u03c3t 7\u2192 \u03bb. Let L\u03bb = L\u03c7(x) \u2192 C denote the Kummer sheaf whose restriction to C \u2212 {0, \u221e} is lisse\nand invertible and for which L\u03bb (0) = \u03bb; note, L\u03bb is tame and N\u00e9ron but does not lie in M. If\nt \u2208 C \u2212 {\u221e} is a closed point and \u03c4t : C \u2192 C is the involution x 7\u2192 t \u2212 x, then \u03c4t\u2217 L\u03bb is lisse over\nC \u2212 {t, \u221e}. Moreover, if F \u2208 MU and i denotes the open immersion U \u2212 {t} \u2192 C, then sheaf\ni\u2217 i\u2217 (F \u2297 \u03c4t\u2217 L\u03bb ), the twist of F by \u03c4t\u2217 L\u03bb , also lies in M. In particular, the \u00e9tale cohomology group\nVt = H 1 (C, i\u2217 i\u2217 (F \u2297 \u03c4t\u2217 L\u03bb )) is the only non-vanishing group and its dimension is constant as t \u2208 U\nvaries over the closed points.\n\nThe middle convolution of F \u2208 MU by L\u03bb , which we denote MC\u03bb (F), is the sheaf in MU whose\nfiber over t is Vt . Katz defined it when the characteristic of k is positive (cf. [Ka2]), and one can\nuse [DR] to extend the definition to characteristic zero (where everything is tame).\nLemma 4.3. The 'functors' MC\u03bb : MU \u2192 MU satisfy:\n1. MC1 (F) \u2243 F;\n2. MC\u03bb1 (MC\u03bb2 (F)) \u2243 MC\u03bb1 \u03bb2 (F);\n\u0001\n\u0001\nP\n3. rk(MC\u03bb (F)) = t\u2208A1 \u2212U codim F(t)I(t) \u2212 dim (F(\u221e) \u2297 \u03bb)I(\u221e) ;\n\u0001\n4. MC\u03bb (F)(t)/MC\u03bb (F)(t)I(t) \u2243 F(t)/F(t)I(t) \u2297 \u03bb for t \u2208 A1 \u2212 U .\n\nProof. The first two statements show that MC\u03bb is 'multiplicative' in \u03bb. See proposition 2.9.7 of\n[Ka2] or proposition 3.2 and theorem 3.5 of [DR]. Statements 3 and 4 follow from corollary 3.3.6\nof [Ka2] or from lemma 2.7 and lemma 4.1 respectively of [DR].\nIf t \u2208 A1 \u2212 U and F = F(t), then the Jordan decomposition of F together with the above properties\ncompletely determines the decomposition of M = MC\u03bb (F)(t). Let Un denote an irreducible unipotent Jordan block of size n. The number of unipotent (or trivial) blocks of the form U1 in either\n11\n\n\fF, M is the dimension of the respective space of I(t)-invariants, and there is a bijection between\nthe non-trivial blocks of F and those of M :\nUn 7\u2192 Un\u22121 \u2297 \u03bb,\n\nUn \u2297 1/\u03bb 7\u2192 Un+1 ,\n\nB 6\u2208 {Un , Un \u2297 1/\u03bb} 7\u2192 B \u2297 \u03bb 6\u2208 {Un \u2297 \u03bb, Un }.\n\n(4.1)\n\nI(t)\n\nThe dimension changes in the first two cases are due to the isomorphism Um \u2243 Um+1 /Um+1 applied\nto unipotent blocks of F, M respectively.\nFor example, let g \u2265 1, f (x) \u2208 k[x] be square-free of degree 2g, and F \u2208 M be the quadratic Kummer\nsheaf L\u03c7(f (x)) . If we write U = A1 \u2212 deg0 (f ), then F \u2208 MU and the Tate twist MC\u22121 (F)(1) is\nthe N\u00e9ron sheaf Jl \u2192 C of the previous section. More precisely, if t \u2208 U is a closed point,\nthen the fiber of MC\u22121 (F)(\u22121) over t is H 1 (C, L\u03c7(f (x)(t\u2212x)) (1)), and the latter is easily seen to\nbe cohomology group H 1 (Xt , (Z/l)(1)) of the hyperelliptic curve Xt /k. For each t \u2208 A1 \u2212 U ,\nthe quotient F(t)/F(t)I(t) is the scalar representation \u22121, so MC\u22121 (F)(t)/MC\u22121 (F)(t)I(t) is the\ntrivial representation Z/l. Thus, MC\u22121 (F)(t) has one Jordan block of the form U2 and the rest\nare all trivial, hence the monodromy is a transvection. From formula 3 of lemma 4.3 we see that\nrk(MC\u22121 (F)) = 2g; note, I(\u221e) acts trivially on F(\u221e).\n\n5\n\nQuadratic Twists of Elliptic Curves\n\nLet q be an prime power not divisible by 2,3 and fix an algebraic closure Fq \u2192 Fq , although we\nremark that most of the results in this section apply if we replace Fq by an arbitrary field of\ncharacteristic distinct from 2,3. We fix a proper smooth geometrically connected curve C/Fq and\nwrite K = Fq (C) for its function field.\n\n5.1\n\nGeometry of a Twisted Curve\n\nWe fix an elliptic curve E1 /K with non-constant j-invariant and write E1 \u2192 C for its N\u00e9ron model.\nFor every non-trivial coset f K \u00d7 2 \u2282 K \u00d7 we write Ef /K for the so-called quadratic twist\n\u221a of E1 /K by\nf . It is the unique elliptic curve over K which is not K-isomorphic to E1 but is K( f )-isomorphic.\nThe N\u00e9ron model Ef \u2192 C of Ef /K is a smooth group scheme and the group of sections Ef (C) is\ncanonically isomorphic to the Mordell-Weil group Ef (K).\nLet l be a prime which is invertible in K. The multiplication by l map on Ef (K) extends to an\nisogeny \u00d7l : Ef \u2192 Ef and we define Ef,l \u2282 Ef to be the kernel. It is a quasi-finite \u00e9tale group\nscheme over C which we call the N\u00e9ron model of the l-torsion Ef [l]. We note that if j : U \u2192 C\nis the inclusion of a non-empty open set, then Ef,l is canonically isomorphic to j\u2217 j \u2217 Ef,l , hence is a\nso-called middle extension. The fiber of Ef,l over a geometric generic point of C is Ef [l] and over\nan arbitrary geometric point of C it is a subspace of Ef [l].\nLemma 5.1. Let v be a geometric point of C. If l does not divide the order of the component\ngroup of the special fiber of Ef over v, then\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f22 if Ef has good reduction over v\ndim(Ef,l (v)) = 1 if Ef has multiplicative reduction over v .\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0 if Ef has additive reduction over v\n12\n\n\fProof. The assumption on the order of the component group over v ensures that all l-torsion lies\nin the identity component of the special fiber. The lemma follows easily by observing that identity\ncomponent is cyclic in the case of multiplicative reduction and l-torsion free in the case of additive\nreduction (cf. proposition 5.1 of [Si]).\nFor l satisfying the hypothesis of the lemma we regard Ef,l as the Fl -analogue of Kodaira's homological invariant (cf. section 7 of [Kod] and section 2 of [Shi]). In order to obtain a similar result for\ngeneral l one must restrict to the intersection of Ef,l with the identity component of Ef . However,\nfor ease of exposition we will assume l 6= 2, 3 and l does not divide max{1, \u2212ordv (j(Ef ))} for every\nclosed point v \u2208 C, where j(Ef ) = j(E1 ) is the j-invariant, so that Ef,l is 'connected'. We note\nthat the set of exceptional l is independent of f .\nWe say that Ef,l has big monodromy if the Galois group of K(Ef [ l ] )/K contains SL2 (Fl ). \u221aFor\nl \u2265 5 we note that there are no index-two subgroups of SL2 (Fl ), hence K(Ef [l]) and K( f )\nare (geometrically) disjoint extensions, so Ef,l has big monodromy if and only if E1,l does. In\nparticular, after we expand the set of exceptional l to include those such that Ef,l does not have\nbig monodromy we obtain a finite set which is still independent of f , and we assume \u039b is a subset\nof the complement.\nRemark: If we write g(C) for the genus of C, then theorem 1.1 of [CH] asserts Ef,l has big\nmonodromy if l \u226bg(C) 0, hence the set of exceptional l may even be taken to depend only on g(C)\nand the primes dividing the coefficients of the divisor of poles of j(E1 ).\nWe write Mf , Af \u2282 C for the divisors of multiplicative and additive reduction respectively of\nEf,l \u2192 C and let Uf = C \u2212 Mf \u2212 Af . By assumption Ef,l has big monodromy, and in particular,\nthe restriction of Ef,l to Uf is an irreducible lisse Fl -sheaf of rank two.\nLemma 5.2. The \u00e9tale cohomology groups of Ef,l over C \u00d7 Fq are Fl -vector spaces satisfying\n(\ndeg(Mf ) + 2 * deg(Af ) + 4 * (genus(C) \u2212 1) if i = 1\ni\ndim(H (C \u00d7 Fq , Ef,l )) =\n.\n0\notherwise\nProof. The cohomology groups for i 6= 0, 1, 2 are trivial by the cohomological dimension of C. The\ngroups are also trivial for i = 0, 2 because Ef,l is irreducible of rank two: these groups are the\n\u03c01 (Uf \u00d7 Fq )-invariants and \u03c01 (Uf \u00d7 Fq )-coinvariants respectively of Ef [l] (because Ef,l is a middle\nextension and is irreducible of rank greater than one). Finally, the dimension for i = 1 follows from\nthe (N\u00e9ron\u2013)Ogg\u2013Shafarevich formula (see [O] or [Sha2]); note, Ef,l is tamely ramified because 6\nis invertible in K.\nLet Vf,l be the \u00e9tale cohomology group H 1 (C \u00d7 Fq , Ef,l ).\nFrobq acts on Vf,l by functoriality, hence we may regard Frobq as a conjugacy class of elements in\nGL(Vf,l ). On the other hand, if L(T, Ef /K) is the L-function of Ef /K, which we note lies in Z[T ]\nand has leading coefficient which is non-zero modulo l, then\ndet(1 \u2212 qT Frobq |H 1 (C \u00d7 Fq , Ef,l )) \u2261 L(T, Ef /K)\n\n(mod l).\n\nIn particular, we obtain an upper bound on the order of vanishing of L(T, Ef /K) at T = 1/q, the\nso-called analytic rank of Ef /K, by studying the order of vanishing modulo l. In [H] we studied\nthe reduction when Ef,l has 'small' monodromy instead.\n13\n\n\fThe usual Weil pairing on Ef [l]\u00d7Ef [l] extends to a non-degenerate alternating pairing Ef,l \u00d7Ef,l \u2192\nFl (1), hence Ef,l \u2192 C is self-dual. Together with Poincar\u00e9 duality we obtain a non-degenerate\nsymmetric pairing of cohomology groups\nH 1 (C \u00d7 Fq , Ef,l ) \u00d7 H 1 (C \u00d7 Fq , Ef,l ) \u2212\u2192 H 2 (C \u00d7 Fq , Fl (1)).\nThat is, we have a non-degenerate orthogonal pairing of Fl -vector spaces Vf,l \u00d7 Vf,l \u2192 Fl . We\nwrite O(Vf,l ) for the subgroup of GL(Vf,l ) preserving the pairing and note that Frobq preserves the\npairing on Vf,l , so belongs to a well-defined conjugacy class in O(Vf,l ).\n\n5.2\n\nFamilies of Twists\n\nFor ease of exposition we assume C = P1 and K = Fq (t). For general C one will have to increase\nthe minimum value of l required for a surjectivity statement of the form of theorem 5.3.\nWe fix an elliptic curve E1 /K such that E1 \u2192 C has at least one fiber of multiplicative reduction\naway from \u221e. We also fix a non-zero polynomial m \u2208 Fq [t] which vanishes at one or more finite\npoints in M1 in order that for every f \u2208 Fq [t] which is relatively prime to m, the twist Ef \u2192 C also\nhas at least one fiber of multiplicative reduction away from \u221e.\nFor every integer positive integer d we define the family of twisting polynomials\n\b\nFd = f \u2208 Fq [t] : f is square-free, deg(f ) = d, gcd(f, m) = 1 .\n\nWe may regard Fd as a (d + 1)-dimensional affine space and we write Fd (Fqn ) for the set of Fqn valued points, i.e. the subset of f with coefficients in Fqn . Unless we restrict the leading coefficient\nof f , there will be many g \u2208 Fd which give rise to an isomorphic twist. However, for every n \u2265 1,\nthe number of twists Eg by g \u2208 Fd (Fqn ) isomorphic to Ef is independent of f \u2208 Fd (Fqn ).\nKatz first suggested restricting to twists parametrized by a fixed Fd in part because the set of twists\nby f \u2208 Fd (Fqn ) satisfy a remarkable uniformity property: the degree of the L-function L(T, Ef /Kn )\nis independent of f and n. In fact, this is a consequence of a deeper sheaf-theoretic statement: for\nevery non-exceptional l, there is a unique \u00e9tale Fl -lisse sheaf Td,l \u2192 Fd whose (geometric) fiber\nover any f \u2208 Fd (Fqn ) is the Fl -vector space H 1 (C \u00d7 Fqn , Ef,l ).\nWe fix a geometric point f \u2208 Fd and let \u03c01 (Fd ) = \u03c01 (Fd , f ) denote the \u00e9tale fundamental group.\nThen Td,l corresponds to a Fl -representation \u03c1 : \u03c01 (Fd ) \u2192 GL(Vf,l ) and the image is well defined\nup to inner automorphism. We define the arithmetic monodromy group to be the image of \u03c01 (Fd )\nand the geometric monodromy group to be the image of \u03c01 (Fd \u00d7 Fq ). If we take Td,l together\nwith its orthogonal pairing, then the results at the end of the previous section imply that both\nmonodromy groups lie in O(Vf,l ).\nThe main question of interest for us is to determine as precisely as possible the monodromy groups as\nd and l vary. While we do not answer this question completely, the following theorem demonstrates\nthat the monodromy is usually 'big' in a strongly uniform way.\nTheorem 5.3. If l \u2265 5 and deg(f ) \u226bE 0, then the geometric monodromy group has index at most\ntwo in O(Vf,l ) and is not SO(Vf,l ). That is, G is one of the following:\n1. the full orthogonal group O(Vf,l );\n14\n\n\f2. the kernel of the spinor norm;\n3. the kernel of the product of the spinor norm and the determinant.\nIn order to prove the theorem it suffices to restrict to one-parameter families parametrized by an\naffine curve U \u2282 Fd and to show that the image of \u03c01 (U \u00d7 Fq ) is already big. More precisely, fix\nany g \u2208 Fd\u22121 and consider the one-parameter family of polynomials (c \u2212 t) * g(t). We let Ug \u2282 P1\nbe the open subset of c \u2208 A1 such that (c \u2212 t) * g(t) \u2208 Fd . Then theorem 5.3 follows immediately\nfrom the following theorem whose proof we postpone until the next section.\nTheorem 5.4. If l \u2265 5 and deg(g) \u226bE 0, then the image of \u03c01 (Ug \u00d7 Fq ) has index at most two in\nO(Vf,l ) and is not SO(Vf,l ).\n\n5.3\n\nKatz One-Parameter Families of Twists\n\nWe fix g \u2208 Fd\u22121 and let Ug \u2282 Fd be as before. The key observation Katz makes to prove analogous\nl-adic monodromy theorems is that the restriction of Td,l to Ug is the middle convolution sheaf\nMC\u22121 (Eg ) \u2192 C (cf. section 4.1). In particular, Td,l is irreducible and tame and we can describe its\nmonodromy around the points of P1 \u2212 Ug . We refer the reader to section 3 for the definition of a\nreflection and isotropic shear.\nLemma 5.5. For every geometric point c \u2208 A1 \u2212 Ug fix a topological generator \u03c3c of the inertia\ngroup I(c) \u2264 \u03c01t (Ug \u00d7 Fq ) and let V = Vf,l .\n1. If Eg \u2192 C has good reduction over t = c, then \u03c3c acts trivially on V .\n2. If Eg \u2192 C has multiplicative reduction over t = c, then \u03c3c acts as a reflection on V .\n3. If Eg \u2192 C has additive reduction of Kodaira type I0\u2217 over t = c, then \u03c3c acts as an isotropic\nshear on V .\nFor all other c \u2208 A1 \u2212 Ug , \u03c3c acts as a non-scalar on the two-dimensional quotient V /V \u03c3c =1 .\nProof. We follow the notation of section 4.1. The fiber of the convolution MC\u22121 (Eg ) over a (geometric) closed point c \u2208 Ug is H 1 (C, i\u2217 i\u2217 (Eg \u2297 \u03c4c\u2217 L\u22121 )), where i : Ug \u2192 C. One can easily show that\ni\u2217 i\u2217 (Eg \u2297 \u03c4c\u2217 L\u22121 ) is the fiber of Ef over c, hence the restrictions Td,l \u2192 Ug and MC\u22121 (Eg ) \u2192 Ug\nare isomorphic, so Td,l \u2243 MC\u22121 (Eg ).\nIf Eg \u2192 C has multiplicative reduction over t = c, then Eg (c)/Eg (c)I(c) is the trivial representation\nFl , so Td,l (c)/Td,l (c)I(c) is the scalar representation \u22121 and the monodromy is a reflection. If Eg \u2192 C\nhas additive reduction of Kodaira type I0\u2217 over t = c, then Eg (c)/Eg (c)I(c) is the two-dimensional\nrepresentation (Fl \u2295 Fl ) \u2297 \u22121, so Td,l (c)/Td,l (c)I(c) is Fl \u2295 Fl . Thus Td,l has two unipotent blocks\nof the form U2 and all other blocks are trivial (cf. (4.1)). Finally, for all other types of (additive)\nreduction we see that Eg (c)/Eg (c)I(c) is two-dimensional and \u03c3c acts as a non-scalar, so the same\nis true for Td,l (c)/Td,l (c)I(c) .\nThe elements S = {\u03c3c : c \u2208 A1 \u2212 Ug } topologically generate \u03c01t (Ug \u00d7 Fq ), hence they generate the\nimage G of \u03c01t (Ug \u00d7 Fq ) in O(V ). One implication is that we can ignore the monodromy around \u221e\n15\n\n\f(which is more difficult to describe). More importantly, the codimension of V \u03c3=1 in V is at most 2\nfor every \u03c3 \u2208 S, and this places severe restrictions on the monodromy when |S| \u226b 0. In particular,\nas deg(g), hence |S|, tends to infinity, the complement of the subset of isotropic shears in S has\nbounded order. Therefore theorem 5.4 is a consequence of theorem 3.1, applied with r = 2 and S0\nthe complement of the reflections and the elements with order prime to (r + 1)! = 6.\n\n5.4\n\nExample: Twists of the Legendre Curve\n\nLet K = k(\u03bb) and let E/K be the elliptic curve with affine model y 2 = x(x \u2212 1)(x \u2212 \u03bb). We write\nFd for the square-free polynomials in k[\u03bb] of degree d which are relatively prime to \u03bb(\u03bb \u2212 1) and\nFd (k) for the subset in k[\u03bb]. For each f \u2208 Fd (k) we write Mf , Af for the divisors of multiplicative,\nadditive reduction of the N\u00e9ron model Ef \u2192 C and div0 (f ) for the divisor of zeros of f .\nLemma 5.6. Suppose f \u2208 Fd (k). Then\n(\n{0, 1}, div0 (f ) \u222a {\u221e}, 2d\nMf , Af , dim(Vf,l ) =\n{0, 1, \u221e},\ndiv0 (f ), 2d \u2212 1\n\nif d is even\n.\nif d is odd\n\nMoreover, the support of the fibers of Ef \u2192 C of Kodaira type I0\u2217 is div0 (f ).\nProof. Everything except the dimension assertions are proved in lemma 7 of [H], while dim(Vf,l ) is\ngiven in lemma 5.2.\nBy theorem 4.1 the sheaves Ef,l \u2192 C have big monodromy for all f \u2208 Fd (k) and all odd l, so\nfor g \u2208 Fd\u22121 (k), l odd, and Ug = C \u2212 Mg \u2212 Ag , the restriction Td,l \u2192 Ug is irreducible and lisse.\nThe monodromy about a geometric point in Mg \u2212 {\u221e} is a reflection and the monodromy about a\ngeometric point in Ag \u2212{\u221e} is an isotropic shear by lemma 5.5, so S0 = \u2205 (if l > 3) and theorem 5.3\nholds for d \u2265 2 and l \u2265 5.\nOne can derive similar results if we replace E/K by the twist E\u03bb /K. In particular, we can construct Vf,l satisfying dim(Vf,l ) = 2d + 1 \u2261 3 (mod 4) for d odd. In order to construct examples\nwith dim(Vf,l ) \u2261 2 (mod 4) one should replace the Legendre curve by one of the curves denoted\nX211 , X321 , X431 in [MP]. In particular, up to an automorphism of the base C = P1 , we can assume\nM1 = {0, 1} and A1 = {\u221e} as before, but now the key difference is that \u221e \u2208 Af for every twist.\nRemark: Together these examples increase the set of big subgroups of orthogonal groups which\nare known to occur as Galois groups over Q(t). It is difficult to say precisely which group occurs,\nbut despite the ambiguity these extend previous results (cf. survey in [MM]).\n\n5.4.1\n\nAlmost Independent\n\nIn this section we assume k is finite or separably closed. Fix g \u2208 Fd\u22121 (k) and let Td,l \u2192 Ug be as\nin the previous section. Let L denote the function field k(Ug ) and let Ll denote the splitting field\nL(Vf,l ). As the following theorem shows, up to replacing L by a finite extension, these extensions\nare almost independent (cf. 10.1? of [S4]).\nTheorem 5.7. If d \u2265 3, then there is a finite extension M/L so Ll1 \u2229 Ll2 \u2264 M for l1 > l2 \u2265 5.\n16\n\n\fProof. By the results in the previous section, if d \u2265 2 and l \u2265 5, then Gl = Gal(Ll /L) is a big\nsubgroup of an orthogonal group \u0393l and Ql = Gl /DGl is a subgroup of Z/2 \u2295 Z/2. Moreover,\nif l1 > l2 \u2265 5 and d \u2265 3 (so dim(Vf,l ) \u2265 5), then the quotients DGli /Z(DGli ) are non-abelian,\nsimple, and pairwise non-isomorphic for i = 1, 2 (cf. theorem 5.27 of [Ar]). Therefore Ribet's lemma\n(5.2.2 of [R]) implies Ll1 \u2229 Ll2 is contained in the fixed fields of Ql1 , Ql2 . On the other hand, the\nfixed field of Ql corresponds to an unramified cover Vg,l \u2192 Ug of bounded degree. In particular,\nthere are only finitely many covers which occur as we vary l because of our assumptions on k, so\nwe make take M to be the compositum of all the corresponding extensions.\n\n5.5\n\nGeneralizing to Abelian Varieties\n\nWhile the previous sections deal exclusively with twists of elliptic curves, both for ease of exposition\nand application, most of the results can be easily adapted to deal with twists of 'many' abelian\nvarieties A1 /K of dimension g with trivial K/k-trace. The easiest is to assume that the Galois\ngroup Gl of K(A1 [l])/K is big for l \u226bA1 0, but it suffices to assume it acts irreducibly on A1 [l] for\nl \u226bA1 0. Either way we must also assume that Gl acts tamely on A1 [l]; this is automatic if the\ncharacteristic of K is sufficiently large with respect to the genus of C. We must also assume that\nA1 /K has at potentially semi-stable reduction with toric part of dimension one over some closed\npoint x \u2208 C. For example, we may take A1 /K to be any J/K from section 4.\nOver almost all the closed points in C an arbitrary quadratic twist of A1 /K has either good\nreduction or totally additive reduction. In the latter case [LO] implies the component group of\nthe fiber over x of the N\u00e9ron model is uniformly bounded by a constant which depends only on\nthe dimension of A1 . For each of the remaining closed points the component group of the special\nfiber belongs to a set of at most two finite groups. Therefore as we vary over the quadratic twists\nAf /K of A1 /K, the set of primes dividing the order of the component group of the N\u00e9ron model\nAf \u2192 C is finite. In particular, if \u039b is sufficiently small, then for every l \u2208 \u039b, we may assume Gl\nacts irreducibly on A1 [l] and l is relatively prime to the order of the component group of Af \u2192 C\nfor every twist.\nWe make these assumptions because they imply the cohomology groups of the Zl -sheaf Tl (Af ) \u2192 C,\nthe latter defined as the projective system of the \u00e9tale sheaves Af,ln (cf. section 2.2 of [G2]), are\nsufficiently well behaved. In particular, the Zl -sheaf Td,l\u221e \u2192 C, defined as the projective system\nof the generalized sheaves Td,ln \u2192 C, is torsion free and Td,l\u221e \u2297Zl Fl is isomorphic to Td,l . The key\nis to consider the Kummer sequence\n\u00d7l\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 Tl (Af ) \u2212\u2192 Tl (Af ) \u2212\u2192 Af,l \u2212\u2192 0\nwhich is defined as the projective system of the sequences\n\u00d7ln\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 Af,ln \u2212\u2192 Af,ln+1 \u2212\u2192 Af,l \u2212\u2192 0,\n\nn \u2265 0.\n\nThe corresponding cohomology sequence simplifies (cf. 2.1\u20132.4 of [Shi]) to\n\u00d7l\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 H 1 (C \u00d7 k, Tl (Af )) \u2212\u2192 H 1 (C \u00d7 k, Tl (Af )) \u2212\u2192 H 1 (C \u00d7 k, Af,l ) \u2212\u2192 0\nbecause H i (C \u00d7 k, Af,l ) = 0 for i 6= 1, which implies the claim.\n\n17\n\n\fReferences\n[Ac]\n\nJ.D.
