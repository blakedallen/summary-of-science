Johnston\nAmes Laboratory and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa 50011 USA\n(Dated: November 21, 2018)\nWe have studied the composition-induced metal-to-insulator transitions (MIT) of cation substituted Lithium Titanate, in the forms Li1+x Ti2\u2212x O4 and LiAly Ti2\u2212y O4 , utilising a quantum site\npercolation model, and we argue that such a model provides a very reliable representation of the noninteracting electrons in this material if strong correlations are ignored.

Our analysis leads to quantitative predictions that are in disagreement\nwith those measured experimentally. For example, experimentally for the LiAly Ti2\u2212y O4 compound\nan Al concentration of yc \u2248 0.33 produces a metal-to-insulator transition, whereas our analysis of\na quantum site percolation model predicts yc \u2248 0.83. One hypothesis that is consistent with these\nresults is that since strong correlations are ignored in our quantum site percolation model, which\nincludes the effects of configurational disorder only, such strong electronic correlations are both\npresent and important.\n\nThe oxide spinel LiTi2 O4 has been the subject of\nconsiderable experimental and theoretical study. It\nwas first synthesised and structurally characterised in\n1971 by Deschanvres et al.1 Superconductivity, at 11K,\nwas identified in 1973 by one of the present authors and his collaborators.2 A comprehensive study\nof the normal state and superconducting properties of\nLi1+x Ti2\u2212x O4 (for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1/3) was reported in 1976,3,4\nand a superconducting transition temperature of 13K was\nobserved. A recent review5 highlights many of the advances made since then.\nThere are several reasons to study this system. Firstly,\nit is interesting to note that superconductivity among\nspinel systems is very rare; e.g., of the 300 or so\nknown spinels,5 only four of them are superconductors\n- CuRh2 Se4 (Tc = 3.49 K), CuV2 S4 (Tc = 4.45 K),\nCuRh2 S4 (Tc = 4.8 K), and LiTi2 O4 (Tc = 11.3 K) and only one of these four is an oxide. So, that oxide,\nLiTi2 O4 , has the highest transition temperature of any\nspinel. Secondly, conduction in this system is believed\nto take place on the Ti sublattice via the t2g orbitals,\nas suggested, e.g., by electronic structure calculations,6,7\nand these sites form a corner-sharing tetrahedral lattice(CSTL). Thus, this system represents an example of\nconduction on a fully frustrated three-dimensional lattice.\nAlso, in this paper we will argue, supported by considerable experimental evidence, that the conduction paths of\nLi1+x Ti2\u2212x O4 and LiAly Ti2\u2212y O4 are excellent physical\nrealizations of quantum site percolation.8,9\nFurthermore, and central to the motivation for our\nwork, these same electronic structure calculations6,7\npoint out that this is a narrow band electronic system,\nwith the bandwidth of the t2g bands of the order of 2-3\neV, thus suggesting that perhaps strong electronic corre-\n\nlations are present and important. Indeed, others have\nreached similar conclusions; notably, the phase diagram\nof Alex M\u00fcller,10 summarising a view of how the increased strength of electronic correlations in transition\nmetal oxides leads to higher and higher superconducting temperatures, includes the Lithium Titanate system. Although the original experiments and analysis suggested a weak-coupling BCS-like s-wave superconductor,4\nit was later suggested11 that off stoichiometry this material is in fact an \"anomalous\" superconductor (although\nthis claim is not without criticism12 ). We also mention\nthat photoemission studies of Edwards, et al.13 are interpreted in terms of strong correlations, and magnetic\nsusceptibility14 and specific heat data11 are interpreted in\nterms of a density of states that is moderately to strongly\nenhanced (see Ref.15 for a discussion of these and other\nexperiments). Taken together, these experimental results\nform a reasonably strong case for the presence of electronic correlations that are important to the physics of\nthese materials.\nLastly, we mention the recent discovery of the first delectron heavy fermion compound, LiV2 O4 .16 This system also assumes the spinel structure, but so far no superconductivity has been observed. The active transition\nmetal ion in LiV2 O4 has a formal valence of d1.5 , whereas\nfor LiTi2 O4 one considers d0.5 ions. Thus, LiTi2 O4 is a\nlower electronic density system than LiV2 O4 , and an understanding of its behaviour would seem to be a prerequisite to a full understanding of the Vanadate material.\nFor example, why does LiTi2 O4 superconduct, with a relatively high Tc , while LiV2 O4 does not superconduct at\nall?\nIn attempt to gain more understanding of the\nLiTi2 O4 system, and, in particular, to try and un-\n\n\f2\nderstand whether or not strong electronic correlations are present, we have examined the density\ndriven metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) of the related Li1+x Ti2\u2212x O4 and LiAly Ti2\u2212y O4 compounds; for\nxMIT \u223c 0.12 and yMIT \u223c 1/3, transitions3,11,17,18,19 to\na non-metallic state (which we refer to as insulating) are\nencountered. To be specific, we use a one electron approach to study this transition employing a quantum site\npercolation model. Our work may be viewed as addressing the question of whether or not the MIT undergone\nby this system is driven by disorder only, similar to an\nAnderson-like MIT. We find that the answer is no, and\nthus this work provides indirect theoretical support for\nthe proposal that strong electronic correlations are important in a description of the complicated transitions\nundergone in the LiTi2 O4 class of materials.\nTo fully explain our model we note the following: (i)\nElectronic structure calculations6,7 show that the bands\narising from the Ti 3d orbitals are separated from the\nO 2p band by about 2.4 eV ; thus, the electronic valence state may be represented as Li+1 (Ti+3.5 )2 (O\u22122 )4 ,\nand we ignore the oxygen sites and focus on only the\nTi sites. The crystal octahedral field around Ti cations\nsplits the Ti 3d bands into two separate and nonoverlapping t2g and eg bands, with the eg bands split off above\nthe t2g bands. Thus, formally this is a very low filling\nsystem - 1/12th filling of each of the (approximately)\ndegenerate t2g bands. Although we have generalized our\nwork to include all three t2g bands, here we will present\nresults for a one-band model of the Ti sublattice, and\nthus the stoichiometric compound is represented by a\n1/4-filled band. (ii) Crystallographic refinements of the\nexcess Li system Li1+x Ti2\u2212x O4 and the doped Al system LiAly Ti2\u2212y O4 have consistently demonstrated that\nboth the excess Li and doped Al ions enters substitutionally onto the Ti sublattice (octahedral sites of the spinel\nstructure).1,3,19,20,21 Assuming that the Li/Al ions that\nare substituted into the corner-sharing tetrahedral lattice\nare fully ionised, these sites would block any conduction\nelectrons from hopping onto such sites; e.g., a simple argument supporting this follows from noting that the Li+\nions will be at least doubly negatively charged relative to\nthe occupied Ti3+ and unoccupied Ti4+ sites that would\nexist in the absence of substituting Li, and thus electrons\nwill avoid these sites in favour of the Ti sites. We shall\nassume that these Li-substituting sites are removed from\nthe sites available to the conduction electrons, which implies that this system represents an excellent physical\nrealization of site percolation.\nUsing such a model the simplest approach to characterising the MIT would be to then associate the transition\nwith the critical concentration at which the classical percolation threshold is reached. For corner-sharing tetrahedral lattices, we have completed a large scale HoshenKopelman22 search, and have determined that this concentration corresponds to a probability of finding an occupied site at the transition of pc \u223c 0.39 \u00b1 0.01. Noting\nthat the relationship between the probability p of site\n\nbeing occupied by a Ti ion (in the stoichiometric Ti sublattice), and the excess Li concentration x, is given by\nx = 2(1 \u2212 p), with an identical y = 2(1 \u2212 p) relation\nfor Al added to the Ti sublattice, in contrast to previous\nstatements17,18 this pc corresponds to a critical excess\nLi, or added Al, of xc = yc = 2(1 \u2212 pc ) \u223c 1.2; that is\nLi2.2 Ti0.8 O4 or LiAl1.2 Ti0.8 O4 . These very high levels\nof doping are well beyond the observed xMIT \u223c 0.15 or\nyMIT \u223c 0.33 concentrations at which the MITs occur.\nIn fact, such a system would require large positive Ti valencies well beyond anything seen in nature! Thus, the\nphysics of these MITs is more complicated than simply\nthe loss of an infinite maximally connected cluster at pc .\nWe now consider a more accurate model for this system, a so-called quantum site percolation model, which\nincludes the dynamics of the electrons hopping on the\nconducting, disordered sublattice of Ti sites. To be specific, the near-neighbour tight-binding Hamiltonian for\nLiTi2 O4 is\nX \u2020\nX \u2020\n(ci cj + h.c.)\n(1)\n\u03b5 i ci ci \u2212 t\n\u0124 =\ni\n\n<ij>\n\nwhere i labels the sites of the (ordered) Ti sublattice, c\u2020i\n(ci ) is thePcreation (annihilation) operator of an electron\nat site i, <ij> represents the sum over all nearest neighbour sites of a corner-sharing tetrahedral lattice, and t\nis the near-neighbour hopping energy. To produce our\nmodel of quantum site percolation for the doped systems,\nthe on-site energy \u03b5j is determined by the probability of\noccupation, denoted by p, of a site being either a Ti ion,\nor a Li or Al dopant ion:\nP (\u03b5i ) = p\u03b4(\u03b5i \u2212 \u03b5Ti ) + (1 \u2212 p)\u03b4(\u03b5i \u2212 \u03b5X )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b5Ti (\u03b5X ) is the on-site energy when an electron occupies a Ti (X = Li or Al) site. In order to enforce that\nitinerant electrons move only on Ti sites we set \u03b5Ti = 0\nand \u03b5X \u2192 \u221e, and this limit connects this system with a\nquantum site percolation Hamiltonian.8,9 Such considerations lead to the introduction of the quantum percolation threshold,9 usually denoted by pq . To be specific, pq\nis reached when all single-electron energy eigenstates of\nthe above tight-binding Hamiltonian are localized. That\nmeans that pq is always larger than pc since the presence\nof extended states necessarily requires an infinite maximally connected cluster. Further, the evaluation of this\nquantity is warranted since pq > pc implies that the theoretical predictions of xc and yc given above would be\nreduced by quantum percolation.\nOur evaluation of pq for the corner-sharing tetrahedral\nlattice proceeds as follows. We have considered various\nrealizations of site percolated lattices for several system\nsizes for a range of dopant concentrations; to be specific, we consider lattices of size two, four, six, and eight\ncubed conventional unit cells (noting that there are 16\nTi sites in the ordered lattice per conventional unit cell),\nand then for each p we examine 100, 50, 20 and 10 realizations consistent with this p, for two, four, six, and\n\n\f3\neight cubed lattices, respectively. For each realization we\nfirst apply the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm to identify\nthe maximally connected cluster. Then, we diagonalize\nthe one-electron Hamiltonian describing the electron dynamics on this cluster. Then, to determine the localized\nvs. delocalized nature of the single-electron wave functions for the maximally connected cluster, we have used\nthe scaling of the relative localization length as a function of system size, as described by Sigeti et al.23 This\nlocalization length, for a particular eigenstate, is defined\nby\nX\n|\u03c8i |2 |\u03c8j |2 d(i, j)\n(3)\n\u03bb =\n\nWith no disorder ( x = 0 )\ng (\u03b5) (a) all states are extended\n000000000000111111111111\n111111111111\n000000000000\n1111111111\n0000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n0000000000\n1111111111\n000000000000111111111111\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n0000000000\n1111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n0000000000\n1111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n0000000000\n1111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n0000000000\n1111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n0000000000\n1111111111\n000000000000111111111111\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n0000000000\n1111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n0000000000\n1111111111\n000000000000111111111111\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\nF\n\n(c) Critical doping\n\ng (\u03b5)\n\nij\n\nwhere |\u03c8i |2 is the probability amplitude for this eigenstate at site i, and d(i, j) is the Euclidean distance between lattice sites i and j. Then, the relative localization\nlength is just the ratio of this quantity to that for a state\nhaving a uniform probability amplitude throughout the\nentire maximally connected cluster (we denote the latter\nby \u03bb0 ) - this ratio thus provides a useful measure of the\neffective size, or localization, of a particular eigenstate\nrelative to a Bloch state on the same maximally connected cluster. The utility of this quantity (and we will\ndescribe its use for another problem below) is that if the\nquantity decreases as the system size is increased, that\neigenstate corresponds to one that is spatially localized;\nthe opposite behaviour is expected for delocalized states.\nWe have used this quantity as a means of identifying pq .\nAs a test of this method, we note that for threedimensional lattices, reliable estimates exist only for the\nsimple cubic lattice, and these were obtained with a variety of different methods - e.g., see the discussion in\nRef.24 A value of pq = 0.44 \u00b1 0.02 was identified,24 and\nwe have found that our method reproduces this number.\nUsing this method we find a value of pq for cornersharing tetrahedral lattices (with near-neighbour hopping only) of pq = 0.52 \u00b1 0.02, and if we then associate this quantity with the concentration at which\nthe MIT occurs in doped LiTi2 O4 , one finds xc = yc =\n2(1 \u2212 pq ) = 0.96, which correspond to Li1.96 Ti1.04 O4 and\nLiAl0.96 Ti1.04 O4 . Again, these concentrations are much\nhigher than the experimentally measured values.\nThe reason for both of these failures is clear and has\nbeen suggested before17 - as the concentration of doped\ncations is increased, the density of available 3d electrons\nis decreased. In fact, for xBI \u2261 0.33 and yBI \u2261 1.0 these\nmaterials become insulators simply because the bands of\nall allowed states are empty (we refer to such a state\nas a Band Insulator (BI)). So, if a one-electron description is going to correctly reproduce the MIT, we must\naccount for the changing of the electronic density with\ncation dopant concentration. (This notwithstanding, we\nneeded to determine what values of xc and yc were predicted by pq in case they were less than either xBI , or\nyBI , respectively. Clearly, they are not.)\nAlso, since the above arguments point to Ti occupation probabilities well above the quantum percolation\n\n(b) Low doping\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u03bc\n\ng (\u03b5)\n\nExtended\n00000000000states\n11111111111\nMobility edge\n00000000000\n11111111111\n0000000011111111111\n11111111\n00000000000\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000000\n0000000011111111111\n11111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000000\n0000000011111111111\n11111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\n00000000\n11111111\n00000000000\n0000000011111111111\n11111111\n00000000000\n11111111111\nF\n\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\nLocalized\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\nStates\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000111111111111\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000111111111111\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\nF\n\n(d)\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u03bc =\u03bc\n\nM\n\nEmpty band\n\ng (\u03b5)\n\nMetal\u2212to\u2212Insulator Transition\n\nxc = ?\n\n(e)\n\nQuantum Percolation\nThreshold\n\ng (\u03b5)\n\nx\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u03bc \u03bc\nM\n\n\u03bc\n\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000111111111111\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n\nF\n\n\u03bc\n\nM\n\n\u03b5\n\nx = 1/3\n\n\u03b5\n0.96\n\nFIG. 1: A sequence of schematic diagrams that summarize\nhow the MIT in Li1+x Ti2\u2212x O4 would proceed if the transition\nwas caused by disorder only. The densities of states vs. energy are shown for several x. The hatched regions identify the\nlocation of extended states, and the unhatched (solid) regions\nof density of states represent the location of localized states.\n(a) In LiTi2 O4 all eigenstates are extended and the system is\na 41 -filled d band conductor. (b) By doping Li cations randomly into the Ti sites the system becomes disordered; thus,\nsome energy eigenstates near the band edges become localized, and, in particular, all states below the mobility edge\n\u03bcM are localized. At the same time the density of itinerant\nelectrons decreases, and thus the chemical potential (\u03bcF ) is\nreduced.

The\nDOS of the undoped system corresponds to the thermodynamic limit, whereas plots for the doped systems are averaged density of states for 83 conventional unit cells using 10\ndifferent realizations of disorder.\n\nthreshold, one is guaranteed to find a maximally connected cluster, and (possibly) several isolated clusters.\nBy definition, all electronic states associated with an isolated cluster are localized, while for the maximally connected cluster both extended and localized states will be\nfound. Similar to Anderson localization25 of disordered\nsystems, we expect that the eigenstates of the maximally connected cluster are localized in the band-edge\nand are separated from extended states at the middle of\nthe band by the so-called mobility-edge.25 By increasing disorder more and more states become localized and\nthe mobility-edge moves toward the centre of the band.\nHowever, as the concentration of cations (producing the\ndisorder) is increased the density of itinerant 3d electrons\nis decreased. As long as the system's chemical potential\n(determined by both the density of 3d electrons and electronic density of states of the disordered system) is above\nthe mobility edge, the system remains metallic, whereas\nif it was below the mobility edge, the states in the immediate vicinity of the Fermi surface would be localized\nand the system would display insulating behaviour. The\ncritical dopant concentration at which the chemical potential and mobility edge meet thus identifies the MIT.\nThe diagrams in Fig. 1 summarize this process for the\nparticular example of Li1+x Ti2\u2212x O4 (for which xc \u223c 0.15\nand xBI \u223c 0.33).\nExample density of states curves, and the locations\nof the chemical potentials, are shown in Fig. 2 for different doping concentrations, averaged over systems with 8cubed conventional unit cells (the largest studied).

This ratio is plotted\nvs. the reciprocal of the number of conventional cells, and\nas the size of the lattices is increased from 23 conventional\nunit cells to 83 unit cells this data shows that the eigenstates\nwith energies above -3.9 have delocalized behaviour. For this\nsystem we estimate that the (lower) mobility edge is located\nat \u22124.0 \u00b1 0.15.\n\nbeen evaluated since the latter contribute to the location\nof the chemical potential.\nThe mobility edge has been estimated using the abovementioned scaling method,23 and Fig. 3 depicts the application of this method to identify the location of mobility\nedge for the specific doping concentration of x = 0.7.\nTo be concrete, one can estimate that for this dopant\nconcentration the mobility edge, in units of the hopping\nenergy t, is -4.0\u00b10.15.\nWe have combined all of our data in Fig. 4, which\nshows the chemical potential and mobility edge that we\nwould estimate for both the excess Li and doped Al systems. For reference we have included the values of the\nband minimum for all dopings. Note that the Fermi\nlevel of the excess Li system crosses the mobility edge at\nroughly xc \u2248 0.324, whereas for the doped Al system this\ncrossing occurs at yc \u223c 0.83. Clearly, these numbers are\nmuch larger than the experimental values (xMIT \u2248 0.15\nand yMIT \u2248 0.33). Thus, we have studied a system that\nshould be very well represented, in a one-electron theory,\nby a quantum site percolation model, have determined\nthe concentrations at which the Fermi levels cross the\nmobility edge, and find these values to be a factors of 2\nand greater than 3 larger than the experimental results.\nSo, we believe that this shows that a one-electron model,\nthat ignores electronic correlations, cannot explain the\nobserved MITs.\n\n\f5\n\n0\n\nConcluding, our results show that disorder-only models of the MITs undergone by these systems substantially overestimate the critical concentrations of doped\ncations. To be specific, for Li1+x Ti2\u2212x O4 our numerical\nresult for xc is a little more than double the experimental\nvalue, and for LiAly Ti2\u2212y O4 our numerical result is an\neven larger multiple. (We note that we have not eliminated the possibility that polaronic effects give rise to\nthis transition, although no experimental work points to\ntheir existence.5 ) Thus, indirectly, this study supports\nthe hypothesis that strong electronic correlations are important for the MIT, and, possibly, also for the Tc \u223c 13K\nsuperconducting transition undergone by LiTi2 O4 .\n\n\u03bcF for Li1+xTi2-xO4\n\nEnergy / t\n\n\u03bcF for LiAlyTi2-yO4\nMobility Edge\n\n-2\n\nbottom of the band\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nxc\n\n0.6\n\ndoping\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nyc\n\nFIG. 4: This plot displays the final numerical results of our\nstudy, and leads to the identification of predicted concentrations at which the MITs occur.
