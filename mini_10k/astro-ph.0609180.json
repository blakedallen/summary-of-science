Energy dissipation due to dipole spindown with ordinary and magnetar fields, and due to torques from a fallback disk are considered as alternative sources of reheating which would\nset the temperature of the neutron star after the initial\ncooling era. Cooling or thermal ages are related to the\nnumbers and formation rates of the DINs and therefore\nto their relations with other isolated neutron star populations. Interaction with a fallback disk, higher multipole fields and activity of the neutron star are briefly\ndiscussed.\nKeywords isolated neutron stars * cooling * energy\ndissipation\n\n1 Introduction\nAll \"magnificent\" seven ROSAT detected sources display X-ray fluxes consistent with thermal luminosities\nof the order of 1031 - 1032 ergs s\u22121 . In particular, RX\nJ1856.5-3754, which is the only source in this class with\na parallax distance determination and kinematic age,\nhas luminosity 3 \u00d71031 ergs s\u22121 at distance 120 pc. For\nRXJ1856.5-3754 and RX J 0720.4-3125 spectra can be\nfit with two blackbodies to cover X-ray and optical data.\nThis is probably an indicative representation of the actual temperature modulation due to the magnetic fields.\nMoreover, the soft to hard luminosity ratio is the same,\n0.5, in both sources, possibly indicating similar physics\non the surface. The soft blackbody seems to cover the\nentire neutron star surface. This suggests that the entire\nsurface luminosity is of order 1031 - 1032 ergs s\u22121 also\nin the latter two sources. Are luminosities of 1031 - 1032\nergs s\u22121 standard for these sources?\nSabanc\u0131 University, Orhanl\u0131, Tuzla, 34956 Istanbul, Turkey\nTel.: +90-216-4839510\nFax: +90-216-4839550\nE-mail: alpar@sabanciuniv.edu\n\nCooling provides the source of thermal X-ray luminosity for a young neutron star. Cooling proceeds first via\nneutrino emission from the interior of the neutron star,\nto give way to cooling by surface photon emission at an\nage of the order of 106 yrs. According to families of standard cooling curves (eg Tsuruta et al 2002), luminosities\nin the range of 1031 - 1032 ergs s\u22121 correspond to the end\nof the neutrino cooling era and the transition to photon\ncooling.\nWhy do we not detect a few sources at age 105 yr and\nluminosity 1033 ergs s\u22121 ? The space density of 105 yr\nold sources is only 10 times less than the density of the\n106 yr old sources. With luminosities one order of magnitude larger according to the standard cooling curves, the\ndetectable volume may not be significantly larger than\nit is for the 106 yr old sources, also considering that the\ndetected neighbourhood being limited by absorption.\nWe might expect an even larger number of older DINs,\nsay at age 3 \u00d7 106 yrs. While the cooling luminosity\ndrops sharply at ages of a few 106 yrs such nearby sources\nwould be above XMM and Chandra detection limits. The\nlower thermal luminosities and effective temperatures of\nolder sources means the spectra are shifted to lower photon energies and therefore detection may be more difficult because of absorption. With only 7 sources, distance\nand luminosity uncertainties and lack of reliable age estimates, it is at present too early to test whether the\npopulation of DINs is consistent with being powered by\ncooling luminosities alone. In particular it will be interesting to see if more statistics and age determinations\nyield sources at ages longer than 106 yrs without the\ndrop-off in luminosity expected in the photon-cooling era\n. With typical distances of the order of 100 pc and if their\ngalactic birthrate is of the order of the total neutron star\nbirthrate, 10\u22122 yr\u22121 , the DINs may well be a population\ndominated by sources older than 106 yrs, whose luminosity is supplied by something else after the drop-off in\nthe cooling luminosity.\n\n\f2\n\nM. Ali Alpar\n\n2 Energy Dissipation\n\nDINs whose cooling luminosity has already dropped off).\n\nWhat else can happen after the initial 106 yrs of cooling?\nA star with viscous coupling between different internal\ncomponents has to dissipate energy when it is spun up or\ndown by an external torque. Reheating of neutron stars\nby energy dissipation was first considered by Alpar et\nal (1984) and Alpar, Nandkumar & Pines (1986) in connection with the dynamical coupling between the pinned\ninner crust superfluid and the crust of the neutron star.\nThe steady state thermal luminosity supplied by energy\ndissipation is of the form:\n\nTorques from a fallback disk near rotational equilibrium\nwith the neutron star can be estimated as\n\nLdiss = J|\u03a9\u0307|\n\n(1)\n\nwhere J is a parameter describing the effective viscous\ncoupling and \u03a9\u0307 is the spindown rate due to the external\ntorque on the neutron star. In the case of the pinned inner crust superfluid-vortex creep model, J\u223c 1043 erg s.\nWhether a detectable thermal luminosity can be provided by energy dissipation after the cooling luminosity\ndrops off depends on the external torque on the star. The\nexternal torque due to a rotating magnetic dipole gives\nthe spindown rate\nI \u03a9\u0307 = \u22122/3 \u03bc2 \u03a9 3 /c3\n\n(2)\n\nwhere I is the star's moment of inertia, \u03bc is the dipole\nmagnetic moment perpendicular to the rotation axis and\n\u03a9 is the rotation rate. This yields the time dependence:\n\u22123/2 1/2 \u22121\nI45 \u03bc30\n\n|\u03a9\u0307| = 4 \u00d7 10\u221213 s\u22122 t6\n\n(3)\n6\n\nwhere t6 is the age in units of 10 yrs, I45 the star's\nmoment of inertia in units of 1045 gm cm2 , and \u03bc30 the\ndipole magnetic moment in units of 1030 G cm3 . The\nexpected energy dissipation rate is\n\u22123/2 1/2 \u22121\nI45 \u03bc30 .\n\nLdiss = 4 \u00d7 1030 s\u22122 t6\n\n(4)\n\nA nearby (d \u223c a few 100 pc) isolated neutron star with\nan \"ordinary\" magnetic moment \u03bc30 \u223c 1 might be detectable up to ages of about 107 yrs. For a constant dipole\nmoment in the magnetar range, \u03bc30 \u223c 100-1000 the dissipation luminosity is very low, and chances of detection\nafter the 106 yrs of initial cooling are negligible. Field\ndecay makes the prospects even worse.\nAn alternative source of external torque on an isolated\nneutron star is the torque from a fallback disk. Fallback disks were proposed for anomalous X-ray pulsars\nby Chatterjee, Hernquist & Narayan (2000). It was proposed by Alpar (2001) that the presence or absence, and\nproperties, of a fallback disk is the initial condition, along\nwith initial dipole moment and rotation rate, that determines the subsequent evolution of all classes of young\nneutron stars. In particular Alpar (2001) suggested that\nthe DINs, being likely to be of ages of the order of 106 yrs\nor more, may be powered by energy dissipation due to\nthe external torque supplied by a fallback disk (for those\n\nI|\u03a9\u0307| \u223c (\u03bc2 /rA 3 )(\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9eq )/\u03a9eq\n3\n\u223c (\u03bc2 /rco\n)(\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9eq )/\u03a9eq\n\n\u223c (\u03bc2 \u03a9 2 /GM )(\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9eq )/\u03a9eq\n\n(5)\n\nwhich gives the energy dissipation rate estimate\nLdiss \u223c (J/I)(\u03bc2 \u03a9 2 /GM )(\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9eq )/\u03a9eq\n\u223c 1031 \u03bc230 \u03a9 2 (M/Msun )\u22121 erg s\u22121 ,\n\n(6)\n\ntaking (\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9eq )/\u03a9eq \u223c 0.1 (comparable to the spread\nof DIN periods). Disks surviving beyond 106 yrs would\nkeep most DINs (the oldest and most abundant) at luminosities of 1031 - 1032 ergs s\u22121 throughout the lifetime\nof the disk, which may be longer than 106 yrs.\n3 Discussion\nAt typical separations of say 150 pc, the DINs must make\nup a galactic plane population of about 10 000. If the duration of the neutrino cooling epoch with L larger than\n1032 ergs s\u22121 is taken to be their representative age, this\nage is 106 yrs. The rate of formation is therefore of the\norder of 10\u22122 yr\u22121 . The DINs make up a substantial\nfraction of the supernova rate: they are a very abundant\npopulation of young neutron stars, comparable to isolated radio pulsars (and possibly RRATS).\nDipole magnetic fields inferred from \u1e56 and P, as well\nas surface fields inferred from absorption features from\nproton cyclotron lines are about 6 \u00d71013 G. This is of\nthe order of or above the quantum critical field, and only\nan order of magnitude less than the inferred dipole magnetic fields of AXPs and SGRs. Periods are clustered in\nthe same special narrow range as AXPs and SGRs, for\n5 DINs observed periods range from 3.45 s to 11.37 s\n(Haberl 2005). This period clustering can be explained\nwith fallback disks acting as a gyrostat around the neutron star, and determining its asymptotic equilibrium\nperiod (Alpar 2001). In this scheme DINs, AXPs and\nSGRs are supposed to be in a propeller interaction with\nthe fallback disk. Most numerous, after the no-disk radio\npulsars, must be the very small mass disk cases, where\nthe disk would have a long lifetime. These are proposed\nto be the DINs.\nAll these classes of objects are in the upper right hand\npart of the P-\u1e56 diagram. All are close to but above the\ndeath line for radio pulsars. They share the P-\u1e56 neighbourhood with the high dipole field radio pulsars. So\nwhy do the DINs (AXPs and SGRs also) not function as\nradio pulsars? This is more of a question for the DINs\nas their inferred dipole surface fields are of the same order as the highest dipole field radio pulsars: the AXPs\n\n\fDINs Cooling and Energy Dissipation\n\nand SGRs might short out the pair creation in the polar\ncap more easily by virtue of fields that are one order of\nmagnitude larger than those of the radio pulsars. Now\nthere is a new enigma: RRATS (McLaughlin et al 2006),\nsome of which are close to same corner of P-Pdot diagram. RRATS also may be similar to AXPs and SGRs in\nthat they burst, though in the radio. What distinguishes\nbetween the different classes might indeed be the presence or absence, and nature of a fallback disk around the\nneutron star. The \u1e40 history of the disk determines the\nequilibrium period to which the star approaches asymptotically. For B = 1012 - 1013 G , a relatively wide range\nof \u1e40 gives a narrow range of equilibrium periods: Peq\nscales with |\u1e40 |\u22124/7 . An interesting example is that if\nthe dipole magnetic field on the surface is the quantum\ncritical field, and \u1e40 is at the Eddington value, this leads\nto equilibrium periods of about 12 s.\nThis approach is not in conflict with magnetar models\n(Thompson & Duncan 1995, Woods & Thompson 2006).\nThe magnetar model functions on the basis of very strong\nmagnetic fields anchored in the neutron star crust. These\nfields are likely to develop and release energy in local processes in the neutron star crust. The surface magnetar\nfields are likely to be concentrated in the higher multipoles, and the dipole magnetic field on the surface of\nmagnetars may be of order or less than the quantum\ncritical field? One might speculate that when the quantum critical field is reached on the surface, leading to pair\ncreation, near surface currents and surface heating, magnetic structure in the higher multipoles will be amplified,\nat the expense of the dipole (global) surface field, which\nmight be limited to a value near the quantum critical\nfield. Arguments for surface multipole fields have been\nbrought up in several connections (Zane & Turolla 2005;\nsee also the contributions by Zane, by Tiengo and by\nGaensler at this conference).\nIn the context of fallback disk models and hybrid models\nwith magnetar fields in the higher multipoles, the presence of fallback disk torques interacting with the dipole\ncomponent of the magnetic field would lead to detectable\nthermal luminosities from the DINs if the disk lifetime\nextends beyond the 106 yr timescale of the cooling luminosity. As explored here, this is because the energy dissipation rate for propeller disk torques near equilibrium is\nstronger than energy dissipation rates supplied by ordinary or magnetar dipole spindown, and may be roughly\nconstant throughout the disk lifetime, unlike the dipole\nspindown case for which the energy dissipation rate decays rapidly with a power law time dependence.\n\nAcknowledgements I thank the Sabanc\u0131 University Astrophysics and Space Forum and the Turkish Academy of Sciences for research support.\n\n3\n\nReferences\n1.
