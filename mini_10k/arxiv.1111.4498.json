Introduction\nOne of the top quests of science today is to understand the mechanism responsible for electroweak\nsymmetry breaking and the generation of mass in elementary particles. The search for the Higgs boson,\none possible solution to this quest, is one of the most\nimportant goals of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nphysics program and for the ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC\nApparatuS) detector-experiment at CERN [1]. Direct searches by CERN's LEP collider experiments\nand the CDF and D0 experiments at the Fermilab\nTevatron have resulted in Higgs boson exclusion limits for Higgs masses lower than 114.4 GeV and between 158 GeV and 175 GeV [[2], [3]]. Since 2010, the\nLHC has been delivering proton-proton collisions at a\ncenter of mass energy of 7 TeV corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 48 pb\u22121 (in 2010) and 2.55\nfb\u22121 (by mid-August 2011) collected by the ATLAS\nexperiment (Figure 1).

The ID is surrounded by a thin\nsuperconducting solenoid, which produces a 2 T magnetic field.

In the following\nsections, different channels are presented for differing\nmasses.\n\n3.1. H \u2192 ZZ (\u2217) \u2192 ````\n3.1.1. Event Selection\n\nStandard Model Higgs decay into four leptons is\ncharacterized by a final state, which consists of two,\nsame flavour and oppositely charged, isolated lepton pairs. The Higgs boson searches for this final\nstate was performed with electrons and muons for\nHiggs masses between 110 GeV and 600 GeV. Depending on the mass of the Higgs boson, one expects that there is at least one di-lepton pair with\nan invariant mass that is consistent with the mass\nof the on-shell Z boson. Kinematic cuts are applied\nto suppress contributions from reducible backgrounds:\nZ+jets and tt\u0304 both of which can be suppressed with\nisolation/impact parameter cuts; and an irreducible\nbackground: ZZ \u2192 4`.\n3.1.2. Background Estimation\n\nThe shape and normalization of the expected backgrounds have been confirmed by a comparison of MC\nsimulated event samples and the observed event yield\nin the data. ZZ production was normalized to MC expectation, including both qq/gq \u2192 ZZ and gg \u2192 ZZ.\nAn integrated luminosity uncertainty of 3.7% and theory uncertainty of 15% is associated with the normalization. Top production is normalized to MC epectation and verified in the control region, with an associated theory normalization uncertainty of 10%. Normalization of Z+jets production is done using control\nregions where Z(\u2192 ``) + \u03bc\u03bc/ee without applying isolation or impact parameter requirements. Separate\ncomponents, like heavy flavour, fakes, electroweak are\ntaken into consideration and the normalization is extrapolated to the signal region with an uncertainty of\n20% - 40%.\n3.1.3. Exclusion Limit\n\nThe search in this channel is sensitive to low and\nhigh Higgs masses with expected limit being at least\n1.05 times the SM rate for a luminosity (dependent\nupon the final state) between 1.96 fb\u22121 and 2.28 fb\u22121 .\nExclusion limits at the 95% confidence level are set\nwith respect to the SM cross section rate for Higgs\nmasses in the regions from 192 GeV to 196 GeV and\n214 GeV to 222 GeV (Figure 2).\n39\n\nFigure 2: Excluded signal cross section with respect to\nthe SM rate at the 95% CL for H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 ````.\n\n3.2. H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 ``\u03bd\u03bd\n3.2.1. Event Selection\n\nHiggs searches were also performed in the ``\u03bd\u03bd\nchannel for masses between 200 GeV and 600 GeV.\nIn this channel, the signal is characterized by one\npair of oppositely charged, same flavour leptons with\nan invariant mass consistent with the on-shell Z boson and a large missing transverse energy (MET)\nfrom the two neutrinos in the final state. Backgrounds in this final state include top/di-boson production and H \u2192 W W \u2192 `\u03bd`\u03bd, an orthogonal finalstate Higgs search channel. Some of the cuts applied to reduce contributions from background include MET requirements, azimuthal angle separation between combinations of leptons, Z, MET, or\njets. The final discriminant used is the transverse\n\u0014q\n\u00152\nq\n2\n2\n``\n2\nmiss\n2\n2\n~\n~\nmass: mT \u2261\nmZ + |PT | + mZ + |PT |\n\u2212\ni2\nh\nP~T`` + P~Tmiss .\n3.2.2. Background Estimation\n\nComparison of MC simulated event samples with\nthe observed event yield in the data show no deviations from the SM background-only expectations. Diboson backgrounds were taken from MC and have an\nassociated uncertainty of \u223c10%. The top background\nexpectation was taken directly from data. Data driven\nmethods were used for W +jets background, taken\nfrom from same-sign lepton pairs, and QCD, which\nhad generally small contributions.\n3.2.3. Exclusion Limit\n\nThis channel is sensitive in a wide mass range, with\nexpected limits between 1.2 and 7 times the SM cross\nsection rate for an accumulated luminosity of 1.04\nfb\u22121 . Exclusion limits with respect to the SM production rate are set at the 95% confidence level for\nHiggs masses from 340 GeV to 460 GeV.

H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 ``qq\n3.3.1. Event Selection\n\nHiggs searches were performed with the ``qq channel, where ` = e, \u03bc and were performed for Higgs\nmasses between 200 GeV and 600 GeV. Similar to the\nother channels, the signal in this channel is characterized by a same-flavour pair of isolated leptons with an\ninvariant mass consistent with the on-shell Z boson\nand a pair of jets whose invariant mass is also consistent with an on-shell Z boson. Requirements on the\nnumber of b-tagged jets (b-tags), like azimuthal angle\nseparation between two leptons or two jets, and high\npT thresholds for leptons and jets are applied to reduce background contributions from Z+jets, tt\u0304, and\ndi-boson production. The final discriminant used in\nthis channel is the ``jj invariant mass where mjj is\nscaled to mZ .\n\n4. Summary\nThe search for the Higgs decays: H \u2192 ZZ (\u2217) \u2192\n````, H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 ``\u03bd\u03bd, and H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 ``qq has\nbeen presented using the data accumulated by the ATLAS detector during the 2011 run, which is up to 2.28\nfb \u2212 1, depending on the channel. H \u2192 ZZ (\u2217) \u2192 ````\ncovers a large Higgs mass range, 100 Gev to 600 GeV\nand the H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 ``\u03bd\u03bd and \u2192 ``qq channels complement H \u2192 ZZ (\u2217) \u2192 ```` by improving the sensitivity in the high mass region above 200 GeV. The\ncombined exclusion limit for Higgs masses in these\nthree channels (for the given luminosities in each channel) is 192 GeV to 196 GeV, 214 GeV to 222 GeV, and\n340 GeV to 460 GeV [6].\n\n3.3.2. Background Estimation\n\nBackground estimation, like in other channels, is\ndone with a mix of MC normalization and data-driven\nmethods. Z+jets is taken care of using the sidebands\nof m`` in bins of b-tags; an uncertainty of < 10%\nis associated with un-tagged events (0, 1 b-jets) and\n\u223c 20% for tagged events (2 b-jets). Top expectation\nis also taken from m`` sidebands and has an associated uncertainty of \u223c 10% from theory. Di-boson\nbackgrounds are taken from MC and have an associated uncertainty of \u223c 10%. The QCD background is\nestimated from data-driven methods - a background\ntemplate is designed for ee and a 2D sideband method\nusing isolation and the invariant mass of the \u03bc pair is\nused for \u03bc\u03bc, contributions are generally small.\n3.3.3. Exclusion Limit\n\nThis channel has good sensitivity in a wide mass\nrange with expected limits between 2.7 and 9 times the\nSM cross section production rate, given a luminosity\nof 1.04 fb\u22121 . An exclusion limit with respect to the\nSM production rate is set at the 95% confidence level\nfor a Higgs mass of 360 GeV (Figure 4).\n39\n\nReferences\n[1] The ATLAS Experiment at the CERN Large\nHadron Collider, JINST 3 (2008) S08003.\n[2] ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL Collaborations, The LEP Electroweak Working Group,\narXiv:http://lepewwg.web.cern.ch/LEPEWWG/.\n[3] The Tevatron New Physics and Higgs Working\nGroup, Combined CDF and D0 upper limits on\nStandard Model Higgs-boson production with up\nto 6.7 fb1 of data, arXiv:arXiv/1007.4587.\n[4] A.
