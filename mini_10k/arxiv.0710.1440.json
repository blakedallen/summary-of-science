The\nstellar system most similar to the ellipticals for age and metallicity, in which it\nis possible to resolve these stars, is the bulge of our Galaxy. sdB star candidates\nwere observed in the color magnitude diagram of a bulge region by Zoccali et\nal. (2003). The follow-up spectroscopic analysis of these stars confirmed that\nmost of these stars are bulge sdBs, while some candidates turned out to be disk\nsdBs or cool stars. Both spectroscopic and photometric data and a spectral\nlibrary are used to construct the integrated spectrum of the observed bulge\nregion from the UV to the optical: the stars in the color magnitude diagram\nare associated to the library spectra, on the basis of their evolutionary status\nand temperature. The total integrated spectrum is obtained as the sum of\nthe spectra associated to the color magnitude diagram. The comparison of the\nobtained integrated spectrum with old single stellar population synthetic spectra\ncalculated by Bruzual & Charlot (2003) agrees with age and metallicity of the\nbulge found by previous work. The bulge integrated spectrum shows only a\nvery weak UV excess, but a too strict selection of the sample of the sdB star\ncandidates in the color magnitude diagram and the exclusion of post-Asymptotic\nGiant Branch stars could have influenced the result.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe UV excess that elliptical galaxies and bulge of spiral galaxies show in their\nspectra at \u03bb shorter than 2300 \u00c5 was one of the most puzzling discoveries in the\nlast 30 years, since these stellar systems are believed to be old and metal rich,\nwithout young and massive stars emitting most of their flux at short wavelength.\nIt is now widely accepted that this UV emission is caused by evolved low mass\nstars, in particular Extreme Horizontal Branch stars (EHB), called also sdB stars\nfrom their spectral classification. These stars are faint in the optical wavelength\nrange and with the current instrumentation it is impossible to resolve them in\nthe nearest galaxies. The stellar system most similar to the ellipticals for age\nand metallicity in which it is possible to resolve sdB stars is the bulge of our\nGalaxy. A sample of sdBs star candidates was observed in the Galactic bulge\nby Zoccali et al. (2003), by means of V and I photometry of the region MW05\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBusso and Moehler\n\nfrom the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS1 , the observations were taken with the Wide\nField Imager, WFI@2.2m). These stars could be either highly reddened sdBs\nor cooler stars affected by lower reddening. A follow-up spectroscopic analysis\nof these stars has been necessary and observations at the Very Large Telescope\n(VLT) telescope were obtained. The data reduction and the comparison of the\nobtained spectra with models of hot evolved stars confirmed indeed that most\nof these stars are bulge sdBs, while some candidates turned out to be disk sdBs\nor cool stars (for more details, see Busso et al. 2005). To be sure that the\nobserved bulge region was not peculiar, other bulge fields were searched for sdB\ncandidates: EIS photometric data of the bulge fields MW07 and MW08 were\nreduced and analyzed, finding that sdB star candidates are present also in these\nfields.\nThis work presents the procedure adopted (following the recipe as in Santos\net al. 1995) to construct the integrated spectrum of the bulge region MW05.\n2.\n\nCorrection for Reddening and for other Contaminating Stellar\nPopulations\n\nIn order to construct the integrated spectrum of the bulge, it is necessary to\ncorrect for the extinction caused by the interstellar medium and to take in\naccount that along the line of sight we are observing not only the bulge but also\nthe Galactic disk. Moreover also a globular cluster (NGC 6558) is present in the\nobserved field.\nTo correct for reddening the Schlegel et al. (1998) dust maps were used.\nTheir resolution is roughly 5 arcmin, that is about half the size of a WFI chip:\nthe reddening was calculated then for the 16 regions resulting by splitting each\nof the 8 WFI chips in half, correcting in this way also for differential reddening.\nIf two stellar populations have different kinematics, the more precise method\nto distinguish them is to compare proper motions of the stars, which can be\nmeasured only by comparing the positions of the same stars at two different\nepochs. In this case though, the observations were taken in one epoch only.\nTo subtract the contaminating stars of the globular cluster NGC 6558 in the\nMW05 bulge field, a region centered on the center of the globular cluster, with\na radius equal to the tidal radius of the cluster, was considered. To validate this\napproach, also radial star counts on the image were taken in account: in the\nexternal regions, roughly beyond 2000 pixels (\u223c8 arcmin) from the center, the\nstar counts start to flatten, indicating that there is no significant contribution\nfrom the globular cluster beyond that range. Only stars in this external region\nwere then taken into account.\nTo decontaminate the bulge color magnitude diagram (CMD) from the foreground disk population, a statistical approach was adopted, using synthetic\nCMDs of the disk in the direction of the observed bulge field. The disk simulations (one for each WFI chip) were provided by S. Ragaini (priv. comm., PhD\nThesis at the University of Padua, for a detailed description of the simulations,\nsee Vallenari et al. 2000, 2006).\n\n1\n\nhttp://www.eso.org/science/eis/\n\n\fThe UV Spectrum of the Galactic Bulge\n\n3\n\nFor each disk star in the disk CMD (Fig. 1, top right panel) the closest star\nin the bulge CMD was picked up and subtracted. The \"photometric\" distance\nbetween two stars in the CMD was defined as:\nd=\n\nq\n\n[7 \u00d7 \u2206(V \u2212I)]2 + \u2206I 2 .\n\nand the bulge star with the smallest distance from the disk star was subtracted.\nThe resulting, cleaned CMD of the bulge is shown in the left bottom panel of\nFig. 1, while the CMD of the stars statistically removed from the bulge CMD is\nshown in the right bottom panel.\n\nFigure 1. Example of the statistical subtraction of the simulated disk field\nfrom the observed bulge field MW05, in this case for the WFI chip #1. Top\nleft panel: observed bulge field CMD; top right panel: simulated disk field\nCMD, where also the number of simulated disk stars not present in the empirical bulge CMD is labeled; bottom left panel: bulge CMD after the disk\nsubtraction; bottom right panel: subtracted disk CMD\n\nThe remaining bulge stars were combined to obtain the final CMD for the\nbulge field MW05 shown in Fig. 2. In this figure the typical bulge sequences,\nas the Main Sequence (MS), the red giant branch (RGB), the red horizontal\nbranch (HB) clump (at V \u2212 I \u223c0.6 and I \u223c14) are evident. The grey dots\nare stars that remain after the disk subtraction, because the simulations do\nnot manage to reproduce well the photometric errors. The filled grey circles\ncould be Blue Stragglers but previous studies as Kuijken & Rich 2001 ruled out\ntheir presence in the bulge, therefore they are assumed to be caused by a not\nprecise subtraction. The stars marked as filled squares seem to form an extended\n\n\f4\n\nBusso and Moehler\n\nFigure 2. Final color magnitude diagram for the bulge field MW05. See\ntext for the stars shown with different symbols. Only stars in black were used\nto construct the integrated spectrum\n\nHB sequence. Blue HB stars have been previously observed in the bulge by\nPeterson et al. (2001) and moreover an extended HB is not typical for the disk\npopulation. The black triangles are probably a combination of real post-HB stars\nand remaining disk blue MS stars. Since there is no way to disentangle the two\npopulations in this case and since post-HB stars should play only a marginal role\nin the UV excess (Brown et al. 1997), they were left out from the construction of\nthe integrated spectrum. The stars marked with asterisks represent the sdB star\ncandidates and they are a mixture of real sdB stars and cooler stars with lower\nreddening. For the construction of the integrated spectrum therefore only the\nblack (MS, RGB, Red HB, Blue HB and Extended HB) stars were considered.\n\n3.\n\nThe Bulge integrated spectrum\n\nTo finally construct the integrated spectrum of the Galactic bulge from the\nUV to the optical the method of Santos et al. (1995) was adopted, using both\nspectroscopic and photometric data and spectral libraries (Pickles 1998, Lejeune\net al. 1997) and the Bamberg archive of optical and UV-spectra of hot subdwarfs\n(Heber, priv.comm.) to extend the sdB spectra to the UV.\nTo construct the sdB spectrum, first of all it was necessary to decide which\nof the sdB star candidates in the CMD to take into account. Only stars with\na good photometry were selected (error in the color magnitude diagram smaller\nthan 0.1), obtaining 112 sdB star candidates. The disk simulation, while taking\ninto account the presence of Horizontal Branch stars, does not include sdB stars\nwhich therefore remain in the corrected disk CMD. However the analysis of the\n\n\fThe UV Spectrum of the Galactic Bulge\n\n5\n\nspectra (see Sec. 1.) showed that only \u223c80% of the candidates are really sdB\nstars and not all these stars have turned out to belong to the Galactic bulge.\nThe percentages found from the spectroscopic analysis were applied to the total\nnumber of sdB stars candidates, since there is no reason to assume that peculiar\nstars were picked up during the selection of the spectroscopic targets: of 116\ncandidates therefore, only 55 % have been considered to be true sdB stars of\nthe bulge (Busso et al. 2005), the remaining ones being cool stars or hot stars\nbelonging to the disk or unclear membership, thus narrowing the sdBs sample\nto 62 candidates.\n\nFigure 3. Association between library (in this case Pickles 1998) spectra\nand CMD: the spectra library points are marked with different symbols (grey\nfilled squares: dwarfs(V); grey filled triangles: subgiant(IV)); grey and black\nfilled pentagons: giants (III); black filled circles : horizontal branch stars;\nempty star (sdB stars). For each kind of stars, each point has different temperature. Every CMD star has been associated to the library spectrum corresponding to the box where the star belongs.\n\nIn order to associate the appropriate spectrum to the other CMD stars,\nthe Pickles (1998) spectral library was plotted on the cleaned and reddening\ncorrected CMD of the bulge region, as shown in Fig. 3. In this figure, the library\npoints are marked with different symbols, depending on the luminosity of class\n(filled squares: dwarfs (V); filled triangles: subgiant (IV)); filled pentagons:\ngiants (III)) while HB stars are marked with filled circles and sdB stars with\nan empty star. Each different point corresponds to a library spectrum with a\ndifferent temperature. The boxes on the CMD were chosen so that every box\ncontains at least one library point. For each box the following parameters were\n\n\f6\n\nBusso and Moehler\n\ncalculated: the mean absolute magnitude < MV >j 2 of the stars in the jth box; the corresponding library spectrum \"magnitude\" mVj obtained from the\nconvolution with the V filter; the weighting factor Cj of the stars inside a certain\nbox contributing to the total spectrum (nj is the number of stars inside the j th\nbox):\nCj = nj 10\u22120.4(<MV >j \u2212mV j )\nFinally, the total integrated spectrum of this bulge region was calculated as sum\nof all spectra (fj ) associated to the CMD boxes, taking in account their weights\nCj :\nFT OT = \u03a3N\nn=1 Cj fj\nThe same procedure was applied also using the BaSeL (Lejeune et al. 1997)\nsyntethic spectral library, where the spectra at solar metallicity, with temperature and luminosity class corresponding to those of the Pickles (1998) stars were\nselected. The result is shown in Fig. 4, where also the comparison with the integrated spectra (from Bruzual & Charlot 2003) of two simple stellar populations\n(SSPs) with an age of 11 Gyr and metallicity Z=0.008 and Z=0.02 is shown.\nThe two integrated spectra obtained using the Pickles and BaSeL library\nare very similar, both in the optical and UV range (see bottom panel). Neither\nthe SSP at Z=0.008 ([Fe/H]\u223c \u22120.5) nor the one at Z=0.02 ([Fe/H]\u223c \u22120.09)\nagree perfectly with the integrated spectra, particularly in the region between\n3300 and 4000 \u00c5, where the two synthetic spectra bracket the integrated one.\nProbably a population with an intermediate metallicity would fit better. It is\nnecessary to keep in mind though that the bulge is not a single stellar population\nwith only one value for the metallicity, but it has a metallicity distribution from\nmetal-poor (down to [Fe/H]\u223c \u22122) to metal-rich (up to [Fe/H]\u223c0.5), with a peak\nat [Fe/H]\u223c \u22120.2 (Zoccali et al. 2003, Rich & Origlia 2005), intermediate between\nthe metallicity of the two single stellar populations adopted. The expected age\nfor the bulge is 10-13 Gyr while the adopted single stellar populations are 11\nGyr old. We note in passing that the fact that the spectrum characteristic\nof a single stellar population, hence formed in an \"instantaneous\" burst, is in\nagreement with the recent work of Zoccali et al. (2006), that, by means of \u03b1element analysis, found that probably the bulge formed very quickly.\nIntegrated and synthetic spectra do not match in the UV instead, with the\nsynthetic spectra showing a larger UV flux. This could be explained with two\nreasons. Firstly, in their stellar population synthesis, Bruzual & Charlot (2003)\ntake into account also post-HB and post-AGB, which have a strong flux in the\nUV range. These stars were not accounted for here since it was not possible\nto disentangle them from the disk population. Secondly, probably the selection\nof sdBs stars was too strict. On the base of the spectroscopic analysis, were\nselected, as bulge sdBs, on the color magnitude diagram only 55% of the candidates to construct the integrated spectrum. Taking into account also the stars\nwith unknown membership the percentage would raise to 65%, increasing the\n2\n\nassuming an average distance of 8.15 Kpc, calculated as the most probable distance.\n\n\fThe UV Spectrum of the Galactic Bulge\n\n7\n\nUV flux by about 20%, which is insufficient to achieve agreement with the SSP\npredictions.\nThus the Galactic bulge probably shows only a very weak UV excess, in\ncontrast to what is observed in the bulge of M31. This is consistent with UV\nobservations of the closest extragalactic systems, which show that this UV excess\ncan vary strongly from object to object (Rich et al. 2005). In addition, the same\nobservations indicate also that the UV excess shows no correlation with physical\nparameters as metallicity or velocity dispersion. A correlation with age appears\nmore probable but it would be visible only at high redshift (Brown et al. 2003).\n\nFigure 4. Comparison between integrated spectra and single stellar population SED. Top panel: The integrated bulge spectrum obtained with the\nPickles 1998 and BaSeL (Lejeune et al. 1997) library are shown with a solid\nand dashed black line respectively. The Bruzual & Charlot (2003) spectra\nfor a single stellar population 11 Gyr old and with metallicity z=0.008 and\n0.02 are shown in grey (see label). To allow the comparison the spectra were\nscaled at \u03bb =5870 \u00c5. Bottom panel: as top panel, but in the UV range.\n\nTo verify the procedure, we constructed the integrated spectrum also for the\nGalactic Globular Clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441, which show an unexpected\n\n\f8\n\nBusso and Moehler\n\npopulation of sdB stars. The procedure was the same as for the bulge fields,\nwith the same choice of not including the post-HB and post-AGB stars. The\nintegrated spectra were compared with the observed integrated spectrum of the\ntwo clusters in the optical (Schiavon et al. 2005) and in the UV (Rich et al. 1993).\nAlso in these cases, while in the optical the calculated and observed integrated\nspectra match, in the UV there seems to be no agreement. This could be a hint\nthat sdB stars are not the dominant cause for the UV excess in these systems,\nwhile a more important role could be played by post-HB and post-AGB stars.\nIn conclusion, the bulge of our Galaxy probably shows only a weak UV\nexcess. We note that this result is neither in contradiction with nearby observations, as in the case of M31, nor with observations of more distant galaxies.\nIn fact the UV excess can vary considerably from object to object and shows no\ndependence on physical parameters like metallicity and velocity dispersion, as\nexplained by Rich et al. (2005).\nAcknowledgments. We warmly thanks Manuela Zoccali for providing the\nphotometric data, Uli Heber for the Bamberg spectroscopic archive of sdBs and\nSukyoung Yi for the theoretical tracks.
