Conclusions\n\n6\n\n1. Introduction.\nYang Mills theory on an ld continuum torus (d > 2) exhibits a phenomenon referred to as\ncontinuum reduction whereby the theory for l > l1 > 0 is independent of l 1 [1, 2]. At\nl = l1 , the theory goes from the confined phase (0c: l > l1 ) to the deconfined phase (1c:\nl < l1 ). The order parameter is the Polyakov loop and rotational symmetry is spontaneously\nbroken. More phases were conjectured to exist [2] in the continuum theory and these are\nrefereed to as Xc phase with X = 2, * * * , d.\nThe aim of this paper is to numerically establish the existence of the 2c and 3c phase\nin addition to the 0c and 1c phase for the continuum Yang-Mills theory on a periodic torus.\nWe will use the Polyakov loop to define an order parameter to be labeled, P [3], and it\nwill take values in the range [0,0.5]. If the U (1) symmetry2 under which the Polyakov loop\ntransforms non-trivially is spontaneously broken, then P\u0304 < 0.5. Let P\u0304x,y,z , be the order\nparameters in the three directions. Then, P\u0304x = P\u0304y = P\u0304z = 0.5 in the 0c phase.\nThere are three possibilities for the 1c phase and one of them is characterized by\nP\u0304y = P\u0304z = 0.5 and P\u0304x < 0.5 with rotational symmetry still present in the (y, z) plane. It\nis difficult to numerically establish the order of the transition from the 0c to 1c phase and\nwe will leave it unresolved in this paper.\n1\n2\n\nWe use l1 to denote the critical size as opposed to lc since we will have a sequence of critical sizes.\nThe U (1) symmetry is the limit of the ZN symmetry as N \u2192 \u221e.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fThe 2c phase also has three possibilities and one of them is characterized by P\u0304x = P\u0304y <\n0.5 and P\u0304z = 0.5 with rotational symmetry present in the (x, y) plane. This transition\noccurs when l = l2 < l1 . One can argue that the 1c to 2c phase transition is first order as\nfollows. In the 1c phase, P\u0304x was less than 0.5 and P\u0304y was 0.5. Since P\u0304x = P\u0304y in the 2c phase,\nit is necessary for at least P\u0304x or P\u0304y to change discontinuously at the 1c to 2c transition. If\none operator shows a discontinuity, all operators will generically show discontinuities and\nthis signals a first order transition.\nRotational symmetry is restored in the 3c phase and P\u0304x = P\u0304y = P\u0304z < 0.5. For the\nsame reason as above, we expect the 2c to 3c phase transition to be of first order. This\ntransition occurs when l = l3 < l2 .\nThe 2c phase is characterized by two short directions and one infinitely long direction\nsince the theory will not depend on the length of the direction where the U(1) is not broken.\nTherefore, this phase describes large N QCD in a small box at zero temperature (or infinite\ntime). Confinement cannot be addressed in the 2c phase since we do not have large Wilson\nloops. The 3c phase describes large N QCD in a small box at high temperatures. The 2c\nto 3c transition is like the transition seen in perturbation theory on S 2 \u00d7 S 1 [4] where S 2\nreplaces the two torus along which the U(1) symmetry is broken in the 2c phase.\nWe extend our discussion to include lx \u00d7 ly \u00d7 lz torus with lx < ly < lz . The transition\nfrom 0c to 1c will occur at lx = l1 and this is independent of ly and lz . The transition\nfrom 1c to 2c will occur at ly = l2 (lx ) with 0 \u2264 lx \u2264 l2 . Furthermore, l2 (l2 ) = l2 and our\nnumerical results will show that l2 (0) > 0. Finally, there is no dependence on lz . Continuing\nalong the same lines, we can say that the 2c to 3c transition occurs at lz = l3 (lx , ly ) with\nl3 = l3 (l3 , l3 ). It is possible that one can obtain this critical size for small lx and ly by\nperturbation theory but it is necessary to consider the zero momentum modes of the gauge\nfields on all three directions. We do not address this problem in the paper.\nThe results in this paper complement the results in the closely related paper by Bursa\nand Teper [5]. We mainly focus on the continuum limit of the various phases using Polyakov\nloops. The paper is organized as follows. We define the relevant technical details in\nsection 2. Our numerical results showing the existence of the various phases are presented\nin section 3.\n\n2. Technical details\n2.1 Lattice gauge action\nWe used the single plaquette Wilson action given by\n\u03b2 X\nT r[Uij (n) + Uij\u2020 (x)]\nS=\n4N\n\n(2.1)\n\nx,i6=j\n\nUij (n) = Ui (n)Uj (n + \u00ee)Ui\u2020 (n + \u0135)Uj\u2020 (n)\n\n(2.2)\n\nn is a three component integer vector labeling the site, i labels a direction and \u00ee denotes a\nunit vector in the i direction. The link matrices U\u03bc (n) are in SU (N ). We define\nb=\n\n\u03b2\n2N 2\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fand take the large N limit with b held fixed.\nAll computations were done on a Lx \u00d7 Ly \u00d7 Lz periodic lattice with Lx \u2264 Ly = Lz .\nOne gauge field update of the whole lattice [2] is one Cabibo-Marinari heat-bath update of\nthe whole lattice followed by one SU(N) over-relaxation update of the whole lattice. The\ncode was run on two clusters, one with 48 nodes and another with 31 nodes. The nodes in\nthe cluster were simply used to generate more statistics using a parallel random number\ngenerator and generating independent configurations with the same set of parameters on\ndifferent nodes.\n2.2 Determination of the critical sizes\nGiven the lattice coupling b and lattice sizes Lx and Ly , the dimensionless physical sizes\nare defined as\nlx,y = lim Lx,y /btad .\n(2.4)\nb\u2192\u221e\n\nThe tadpole improved coupling [6], btad is defined as\nbtad = be(b) = bh\n\nX\n1\nT r[Uij (n) + Uij\u2020 (n)]i\n12N Lx Ly Lz\n\n(2.5)\n\nn,i6=j\n\n2.3 Lattice bulk transition\nSince the computations in this paper use the Wilson gauge action on the lattice, it is\nnecessary to address the unphysical transition which is the extension of the Gross-Witten\ntransition [7] in QCD2 . The order parameter for this transition is the plaquette operator.\nThe third order transition analytically computed in QCD2 remains to be true based on\na numerical investigation in QCD3 [5] and the critical point is b = 0.43. This lattice\ntransition does not survive the continuum limit and we will work with b > 0.43 throughout\nthis paper in order to describe continuum physics.\n2.4 An order parameter\nAn order parameter suitable for studying the phase transitions we are interested in is [3]\nP\u0304x,y,z = hPx,y,z i\nX\n1\n1\n1\u2212\nT rPx,y,z (n)\nPx,y,z =\n2Lx Ly Lz n\nN\n\n2\n\nLx,y,z\n\nPx,y,z (n) =\n\nY\n\nUi (n + m\u00ee).\n\n(2.6)\n\nm=1\n\nThe quantity Px,y,z takes values in the range [0, 0.5] on any gauge field background and we\nchoose the x, y and z directions on each configuration such that Px < Py < Pz .\nAlthough this observable needs to be renormalized, we found it sufficient to work with\nthe unrenormalized operator and we also did not have to smear the link variables. The\neigenvalues,ei\u03b8k ; k = 1, * * * , N , of the Polyakov loop operator, Px,y,z (n), are gauge invariant.\nPx,y,z = 0.5 implies a uniform distribution of the eigenvalues of Px,y,z (n). A departure\nfrom Px,y,z = 0.5 implies the presence of a peak in the distribution of the eigenvalues of\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fPx,y,z (n) and a breaking of ZN symmetry associated with this operator. There is no gap\nin the distribution of the eigenvalues of Px,y,z when ZN is broken.\n\n3. Transitions in Polyakov loops\nAll computations were done using N = 47. Having picked a lattice size Lx \u00d7 Ly \u00d7 Ly ,\neach run listed in Table 1 was a closed loop in the lattice coupling b. The third column\nin Table 1 shows the range of b and the step size in b. The fourth column, Nt , shows the\nnumber of thermalization sweeps at the two end points. Only one measurement was done\nper node at each b and the fifth column, Nb , shows the number of sweeps done at each\nintermediate b before the measurement. For example, the run on 33 lattice, started at a\nb = 0.5 and went up to a b = 2.5. A total of 2000 sweeps were performed at b = 0.5 and\nb = 2.5 and a total of 1000 sweeps were performed for all b in between 0.5 and 2.5. The\nstep size in b was 0.05 and this code was run on the 31 node cluster with one measurement\nat each b per node. All values of b between 0.5 and 2.5 had two sets of measurements; one\non the way up in b and one the way down in b.\nLx\n3\n4\n5\n6\n5\n4\n3\n4\n3\n3\n\nLy\n3\n4\n5\n6\n6\n5\n4\n6\n5\n6\n\nb\n[0.5,2.5;0.05]\n[0.5,3.5;0.05]\n[0.5,2.5;0.05]\n[0.5,4.5;0.10]\n[1.5,3.5;0.10]\n[0.5,3.5;0.05]\n[0.5,2.5;0.05]\n[2.0,5.0;0.10]\n[2.0,4.0;0.10]\n[2.0,8.0;0.20]\n\nNt\n2000\n3000\n2000\n2000\n3000\n3000\n3000\n3000\n3000\n2000\n\nNb\n1000\n600\n400\n400\n600\n600\n600\n600\n600\n400\n\nNcfg\n31\n48\n31\n31\n48\n48\n48\n48\n48\n31\n\nLx\nbtad (0c\n\n\u2212 1c)\n6.14(33)\n5.76(21)\n5.60(47)\n5.37(48)\n6.00(46)\n6.56(76)\n\nLy\nbtad (1c\n\n\u2212 2c)\n4.02(14)\n3.83(28)\n3.73(35)\n3.82(70)\n2.70(25)\n2.47(23)\n2.07(20)\n1.78(17)\n1.53(15)\n1.14(11)\n\nLz\nbtad (2c\n\n\u2212 3c)\n2.27(17)\n2.14(17)\n2.17(23)\n1.99(38)\n\nTable 1: The parameters of all the runs used to study the transitions in Polyakov loops along\nwith the results for the critical sizes.\n\n3.1 Details of the data analysis\nThe plaquette as defined in (2.5) was measured on all configurations and this was used to\nobtain the tadpole improved coupling, btad . Figure 1 shows the results for all three Polyakov\n4\nfor the data obtained on the 43 lattice (second row\nloop observables as a function of btad\nin Table 1). The hysteresis is clear in both P\u0304x and P\u0304y for the 1c-2c transition and it is\nseen in all the P\u0304x,y,z for the 2c-3c transition. The critical size for the various transitions\nalong with the error is obtained by locating the two points (one for upward direction and\nthe second for the downward direction) where the error is largest in the observable that\nis broken. The vertical lines in Figure 1 shows the critical sizes along with the errors and\nthese results are shown in the last three columns of Table 1.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fWithin the 2c phase one sees a difference in P\u0304x and P\u0304y . But this is just a consequence\nof our choice of observable. Note that we have picked Px < Py on every configuration. If\nwe assume two independent Gaussian random variables, \u03b1 and \u03b2, that have the same mean\nand variance, then one can show that the variables Px and Py defined as the minimum and\nmaximum of \u03b1 and \u03b2 will be distributed such that\nq\n\nP\u0304y \u2212 P\u0304x\n2\n2\nPx,y\n\u2212 Px,y\n\n2\n=\u221a\n.\n\u03c0\u22121\n\n(3.1)\n\nOur data within the 2c phase is consistent with the above equation.\nWe did not choose a range in b such that all transitions are seen on all Lx , Ly pairs\nsince some of them were used only to investigate the 1c-2c transition. But, we always\npicked a range such that the end points are in one of the four phases.\n3.2 0c-1c transition\nLet us focus on the seventh column in Table 1 to study the confinement-deconfinement\ntransition. The results on 33 , 43 , 53 and 63 show that the 0c-1c transition is physical since\nx\n, is the same on all four lattices within errors. The results here are\nthe critical size, bLtad\nconsistent with the older results presented in [1]. We also studied the 0c-1c transition on\n4 \u00d7 52 and 3 \u00d7 42 and found that the critical size is independent of Ly as expected. Figure 2\nshows that the six results for the 0c-1c transition do scale properly and we estimate the\ncontinuum critical size to be l1 = 5.90(47). If we take the central value for the dimensionless\n\u221a\nstring tension from [8], namely, \u03c3 = 0.1975, then we get\n1\n\u221a = 0.86(7)\nl1 \u03c3\nand this is consistent [9] with saying that\n\n1\nl1\n\n(3.2)\n\nis the deconfinement temperature.\n\n3.3 1c-2c transition on L3 lattices\nThe physical size associated with the 1c-2c transition, l2 . is expected to depend on lx ,\nthe temperature in the deconfined phase. We first estimate the critical size on lattices\nwith Lx = Ly . We use the data on 33 , 43 , 53 and 63 . The four results show continuum\nscaling as can be seen from Figure 3 and we conclude that the 1c-2c transition exists in\nthe continuum limit. We estimate l2 (l2 ) = 3.85(43). As mentioned before, 1c phase is\nthe deconfined phase. The system is a small finite box at zero temperature in the 2c\nphase. This transition occurs on a l3 torus when the temperature is 1.53(21) times the\ndeconfinement temperature.\n3.4 2c-3c transition on L3 lattices\nWe also investigated the 2c-3c transition on 33 , 43 , 53 and 63 . Here again, the four results\nshow continuum scaling as can be seen from Figure 4 and we conclude that the 2c-3c\ntransition also exists in the continuum limit. The transition size will depend on lx and ly\nwhen both of them are smaller than lz . But, we only estimate l3 (l3 , l3 ) = 2.14(26) here.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fLarge N QCD on a very small torus, l3 , for l < l3 feels the size of the box and the\ntemperature is high. Large N QCD is in a small box of size l at zero temperature if l > l3\nand it undergoes a phase transition into the deconfined phase when the box size is 1.80(30)\ntimes l3 .\n3.5 Phase diagram for lx \u2264 ly \u2264 lz\nThe single scale in the 1c phase is lx which can also be thought of as inverse temperature in\nthe deconfined phase. The 2c phase has two scales, namely the size of the two dimensional\nbox lx and ly with lx \u2264 ly . If ly > l2 (lx ), then the theory does not depend on ly and we\nare in the deconfined phase. We considered the special case of lx = ly in section 3.3. We\nextended this to the case when lx < ly . For this purpose, we considered the lattices listed\nin last six rows of Table 1. The phase transition in P\u0304y is shown in Figure 5. There is an\nobvious dependence of the critical size l2 on lx .\nFigure 6 summarizes the various phases by focusing on the (lx , ly ) plane at lz = ly . The\ndependence of l2 (lx ) is shown using the shaded square points in Figure 6. The dashed line\nis a quadratic fit to the seven points and we note that l2 (0) > 0. In order to get an overall\npicture, we have also shown the 0c-1c transition in Figure 6. The dotted line indicates that\nthe 0c-1c transition does not depend on ly for ly > lx . Figure 6 also shows the 0c, 1c and\n2c phases for lx \u2264 ly \u2264 lz . For completeness, we have also shown the 2c-3c transition as\nseen on this specific (lx , ly ) plane restricted to lx = ly . Like the 1c-2c transition, the 2c-3c\ntransition will also show a dependence on lx for lx < ly and the 2c phase will not reach\nthe lx = ly line for lx = ly < l2 . Furthermore, the 2c-3c transition curve will change as\none changes the lz that defines the (lx , ly ) plane. We have not investigated these details\npertaining to the 2c-3c transition in this paper. But, we should remark that the rest of the\nphase diagram does not depend on lz for lz > ly > lx .\n\n4. Conclusions\nLarge N QCD in three dimensions on a l3 continuum torus exists in four different phases.\nThe theory is in the confined phase (0c) for l \u2265 5.90(47) = l1 and physics does not depend\non the box size. This critical size is the inverse of the deconfinement temperature, Tc = l11 ,\nand the theory is in the deconfined phase (1c) for 1 < TTc < 1.53(21).\nThe system is in a finite box and feels the effect of temperature (3c phase) when\nl < 2.14(26) = l3 . The temperature has no effect if 1 < ll3 < 1.80(30) (2c phase). The\nsystem goes into the deconfined phase if ll3 > 1.80(30).\nAll phase transitions are most likely first order in nature. We have provided arguments\nfor this scenario when going from 1c-2c and 2c-3c. Previous results [9, 10] indicate that\nthe deconfinement phase transition is also first order.\nThe 1c to 2c transition on a lx \u00d7 ly \u00d7 lz torus with lx \u2264 ly \u2264 lz depends on lx . The\ncritical line is given by l2 (lx ) = 0.56 + 1.08lx \u2212 0.059lx2 and this is valid for 0 \u2264 lx \u2264 3.85(23)\nand it is independent of lz . This transition has been analyzed for one point on the (lx , ly )\nplane in [5] and we are in agreement with the result in that paper.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nR.
