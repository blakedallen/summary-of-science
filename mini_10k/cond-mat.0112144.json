These junctions exhibit a gap magnitude, \u2206 \u223c 2.5\nmeV, that is considerably smaller than the BCS value, but which clearly and reproducibly closes\nnear the bulk Tc . In conjunction with fits of the conductance spectra, these results are interpreted\nas direct evidence of two\u2013band superconductivity.\nPACS numbers: 73.40.Gk, 74.50.+r, 74.70.Ad, 74.80.Fp\n\nhigh temperatures where it is still visible in the raw data,\na key observation supporting two\u2013band superconductivity. These junctions only probe the band with the small,\ninduced gap suggesting the SIS configuration strongly favors tunneling between the 3d sheets. Second, a subtle\nspectral feature is observed in the conductance near 9\nmeV that resembles strong\u2013coupling effects. Using a theoretical, two\u2013band model [5] that treats pair transfer and\nthe quasiparticle self\u2013energy on an equal footing, we have\nquantitatively fit this feature. This indicates that self\u2013\nenergy effects originating from quasiparticle scattering\nbetween bands are important. Finally and importantly,\nusing unique features of SIS junctions, we have more rigorously ruled out proximity effects which otherwise can\nmimic the temperature dependencies and the quasiparticle self\u2013energy effects of two\u2013band superconductivity.\nCompact samples of MgB2 were formed from amorphous B powder (4N's purity) and high purity Mg. The\nB powder was pressed into pellets under 6 kbar pressure.\nThese free standing pellets were reacted with Mg vapor\nat 850\u25e6C for 2 hr in a BN container under 50 bar of\nAr. During the diffusion reaction the pellets broke up\ninto irregularly shaped pieces several mm on a side. The\nmaterial typically showed Tc = 39 K. To obtain a clean\nand smooth surface, the samples were polished until a\nshiny surface was exposed. No solvent was used and the\nsamples were only cleaned in a flow of dry N2 gas.\nThe tunneling measurements were performed on two\ndifferent samples (A and B) using a point\u2013contact apparatus [8] with a gold tip. This technique yielded\nsuperconductor\u2013insulator\u2013normal metal (SIN) junctions\nas well as SIS break junctions, the latter being confirmed\nby fits to the temperature dependent conductance as\nwell as the observation of Josephson currents. Fig. 1\ngives an example of a Josephson tunnel junction obtained\non sample A. In the current voltage characteristic there\nis a distinct jump visible between a well\u2013pronounced,\nslightly hysteretic Josephson current and the quasiparticle branch which displays a gap feature at eV = 2\u2206.\ndI\nIn the dV\nvs. V spectra, sharp peaks are seen which can\nbe fit to a BCS s\u2013wave model with \u2206 = 2.1 meV and\n\u0393 = 0.5 meV. The fit is very good except for a weak\nspectral feature in the data near 9 mV, which we discuss\n\nThe discovery of superconductivity in MgB2 has led\nto intense research activity, but the nature of the energy gap, \u2206, has been elusive. Tunneling spectroscopy,\nwhich is the most direct measure of this quantity, has\nrevealed a large spread of \u2206 values and considerable\nvariation in its spectral shape. Sharp, BCS\u2013like tunneling spectra have been observed in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with a surprisingly small \u2206 = 2.0\nmeV [1]. Other STM and point\u2013contact studies revealed\ndouble\u2013peaked spectra at low temperatures [2,3] that\nwere interpreted as evidence for two\u2013gap superconductivity. A provocative suggestion is that multiple gaps are\na consequence of the coupling of distinct electronic bands\n[4]. Our ability to fabricate superconductor\u2013insulator\u2013\nsuperconductor (SIS) break junctions has led to unique\nobservations and we have gone beyond these initial reports to present more compelling evidence that MgB2 is\none of the rare examples of two\u2013band superconductivity. In addition, our identification of a weak higher\u2013bias\nspectral feature has provided important insight into the\nnature of the inter\u2013band coupling.\nThe simplicity of the crystalline structure in MgB2 allows for ab\u2013initio calculations of its electronic properties\n[6], from which it is known that the Fermi surface consists\nof four sheets, two being two dimensional (2d) bonding \u03c3\u2013\nbands and two being three dimensional (3d) bonding and\nantibonding \u03c0\u2013bands. An and Pickett [7] propose superconductivity to be driven by the 2d \u03c3\u2013bands, where electrons are strongly coupled primarily to the E2g phonon\nmode. This raises important questions of how superconductivity would manifest itself on the 3d sheets and how\nthe tunneling density of states (DOS) would depend on\nthe crystallographic orientation.\nA more recent work [4] treated the problem by reducing it to two distinct bands which, in the clean limit,\nleads to the appearance of two isotropic gaps, \u22062 \u223c 7.2\nmeV and \u22061 \u223c 2.4 meV, associated with the 2d and\n3d bands respectively. The small gap, \u22061 , on the 3d\nsheets is enhanced above its intrinsic value due to virtual\nphonon exchange (pair transfer) with the 2d sheets and\nshould persist up to the bulk Tc .

Lower inset: Comparison to an SIN\njunction on sample B showing a comparable gap magnitude\nat 1.6 K.\n\nlater. The simultaneous observation of a well developed\ngap feature and a significant Josephson current establishes these junctions to be of SIS geometry. The gap\nvalue is significantly less than the BCS expectation of 5.9\nmeV, but consistent with the Ic RN product of 2.2 meV\nfor this junction (other junctions gave comparable values). Note that similarly low values of Ic RN were found\nin a recent study of Josephson junctions in MgB2 [9] prepared by a completely different break junction method.\nAlthough the focus of this study is on the SIS junctions,\nsimilar gap values were consistently found in SIN junctions (lower inset of Fig. 1). Fits to a smeared BCS model\nyield \u2206 = 2.6 meV and \u0393 = 0.5 meV, that are consistent\nwith the parameters obtained for SIS junctions.\nMany SIS junctions were obtained at different locations on samples A and B. With increasing resistance\nof the junction the Josephson currents decrease, and for\ncontact resistances higher than \u223c 10 k\u03a9 no supercurrent\nis visible at zero bias. Nevertheless, the junctions could\nbe easily identified as SIS by the evolution of the conductance spectra with increasing temperature. SIN junctions\nshow a rapid decrease in peak height at eV = \u2206 with increasing temperature, while the peak position remains\napproximately constant. In contrast, the gap structure\nof SIS junctions remains sharp even for elevated temperatures, and the 2\u2206\u2013peak position follows the closing of\nthe gap at Tc . We traced three such junctions formed\non different parts of the MgB2 sample A up to temperatures of \u223c 30 K, and two of these sets of data are shown\nin Fig. 2, while the third is shown as a color map in Fig.\n3. What is immediately evident in the raw data is that\nthe small gap persists up to 30 K. Each curve shown in\nFig. 2 was divided by RN (the high bias resistance of the\n4.2 K data) and then fit to an s\u2013wave gap SIS model using the measured temperature. The smearing parameter\n\u0393 was adjusted once to reproduce the low\u2013temperature\ndata and then held fixed. This was done to prove the\n\nability of the model to account for all major features of\nthe temperature dependent data using \u2206 as the only adjustable parameter. The fits shown in Fig. 2 reproduce\nthe peak heights, the shape of the in\u2013gap conductance as\nwell as the evolution of the zero\u2013bias peak that is due to\nthermally activated quasiparticle current. This zero\u2013bias\nfeature cannot appear in SIN tunneling but is a known\nfeature of SIS tunneling. The magnitude of this central\npeak is surprisingly high, and this is caused by the unusual case of a small gap which persists to comparatively\nhigh temperatures (much higher than the BCS Tc connected with this gap) thus giving rise to unusually large\nthermal activation of quasiparticles. The BCS Tc for a\nlow temperature gap of \u223c 2.5 meV is below 17 K, and the\ngap seen here is still clearly developed at a temperature\naround 30 K. This rules out a lower Tc on the sample\nsurface as an explanation of the small gap value as this\nwould display a second transition near 17 K, which is not\nobserved (see Fig. 3). Instead, these features indicate\na bulk property is being measured that clearly deviates\nfrom strong coupling or BCS weak coupling theory.\nAfter taking the first set of temperature\u2013dependent\ndata (junction #1) the point contact tip was twice mechanically retracted over \u223c 100 \u03bcm and two new junctions (#2 and #3) were formed on the same sample (A),\nshowing the identical spectral shapes and temperature\ndependence. Since the thread mechanism of the tip approach does not preserve the microscopic lateral position\non the sample, these junctions have to be regarded as entirely independent and their consistency thus proves the\nreproducibility of these observations. In addition it will\nbe shown that SIS junctions on sample B display nearly\nidentical low\u2013T characteristics. Further tests, which included etching of the Au tip, suggested these junctions\nwere formed by breaking off an MgB2 crystal fragment\nwhich then forms an SIS junction with the bulk material.\n2\n\n\fexpected BCS value.\nWe propose that the data of Fig. 3 together with our\nanalysis of the conductance spectra presented below are\ncompelling evidence of two\u2013band superconductivity as\nsuggested by Liu et al. [4]. The absence of any evidence\nfor a second transition in Fig. 3 indicates that \u22061 is primarily induced via coupling to the 2d band. We believe\nthat the persistent and clear observation of only \u22061 in\nour SIS and SIN junctions is due to the much higher\nprobability of tunneling into the 3d band. This band accounts for 58% of the total DOS [4] which is insufficient\nto account for its preference. It rather is the dominance\nof tunneling by electrons with momenta normal to the\nbarrier which favors the 3d band. Assuming a random\norientation, there is a relatively low probability of being\nproperly aligned with the 2d band.\nThe low temperature conductance spectra reveal a\nweak but reproducible structure near 9 mV which we\nbelieve is related to the large gap, \u22062 , but is not due\nto direct tunneling into the 2d band. This conclusion\nis supported by a calculation of the quasiparticle DOS\non each sheet using the McMillan tunneling model [5].\nThis model simulates a coupled, two\u2013band system by\nincluding the BCS\u2013type, virtual phonon coupling (pair\nexchange) between bands [12,13] and also self\u2013energy effects from interband quasiparticle exchange. The model\nrequires the solution of two simultaneous equations:\np\n\u2206ph + \u03931 \u22062 (E)/ \u220622 (E) \u2212 (E \u2212 i\u0393\u22172 )2\np\n\u22061 (E) = 1\n(1)\n1 + \u03931 / \u220622 (E) \u2212 (E \u2212 i\u0393\u22172 )2\n\n150\n\ndI/dV [\u03bcS]\n\nV [mV]\n\n10\n0\n\n\u2206 [meV]\n\n-10\n\nsample A junction # 3\n\n100\n50\n0\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\nT [K]\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nFIG. 3. Top panel: Color map of SIS junction conductance spectra as a function of temperature. Bottom panel:\nTemperature dependence of the small superconducting gap\n\u22061 . Symbols are data extracted from SIS fits to the conductance spectra (different symbols represent three different\nexperiments). The solid line gives \u2206(T ) according to BCS\ntheory, using the expected ratio of 2\u2206(0)/kB Tc . The dashed\nline gives a rescaled BCS dependence with both \u2206 and Tc\nadjusted to fit the experimental data.\n\nThis procedure of creating SIS break junctions is well\nknown for point\u2013contact tunneling into BSCCO [10]. The\nease with which reproducible SIS junctions were formed\nwas quite surprising and this requires us to critically review our previously published data which showed similar\nspectral shapes at 4.2 K [11], but no T \u2013dependence was\nmeasured. The data presented there were interpreted in\nterms of SIN tunneling with a gap value of 4.3 \u2212 4.6 meV\nand no smearing parameter \u0393. This analysis is similar\nin shape to an SIS characteristic with \u2206 = 2.5 meV and\n\u0393 = 0.5 meV (typical parameters used here to fit the\ndata e.g. in Fig. 2), leading to the possibility that some\nof the junctions in that work were in fact SIS type. This\nwould bring the measured gaps of that work in line with\nwhat was consistently observed here.\nThe values for \u22061 (T ) extracted from the fits to the conductance data on these three junctions are shown in Fig.\n3. The uncertainty in the measured gap values is given\nby the error bars and there is excellent reproducibility\namong the three junctions. The solid line gives the BCS\ndependence for a low temperature gap of 2.5 meV with\nthe expected Tc = \u22061 (0)/(1.76kB ) = 16.5 K. Comparison of the data with the BCS fit shows a clear anomaly,\nthe small gap persists up to temperatures far beyond\nthe expected Tc . The dashed line gives a rescaled BCS\n\u2206(T ) with the Tc adjusted to fit the experimental data.\nThis leads to an extrapolated Tc near the bulk value for\nMgB2 but we want to strongly emphasize, that there is\nno basis for this type of rescaling within BCS theory.\nThis should be contrasted with strong\u2013coupling effects\nwhich commonly lead to a zero temperature gap that exceeds the BCS value resulting in an enhanced gap ratio\n2\u2206(0)/kB Tc . Here, this ratio is much smaller than the\n\nfor the energy dependence of the two gaps, where the second equation is obtained by interchanging the subscripts\n1 and 2. These functions \u22061,2 (E) are subsequently used\nto compute the DOS in both bands via the usual BCS\nexpression. Convolution of these DOS then yields the\ndesired SIS conductance characteristics. The model includes six parameters: the intrinsic pairing gaps on both\nbands in the absence of any interband coupling, \u2206ph\n1,2 ,\ntwo scattering rates, \u03931,2 , related inversely to the times\nspent in each band prior to scattering to the other, and\ntwo smearing parameters, \u0393\u22171,2 , which were added to account for lifetime effects within each band. Rather than\ntreat each parameter as free, we fix the intrinsic pairing\ngaps by considering first principle calculations for MgB2\nph\n[4], viz. \u2206ph\n1 = 0 and \u22062 = 7.2 meV [14]. The first assumption is further justified by noting that only a single\ntransition is observed in Fig. 3. The observed induced\ngap magnitude is then adjusted by appropriate choice of\n\u03931,2 . These parameters are highly interdependent and\ncannot separately be determined. Good fits can be obtained for ratios \u03932 /\u03931 between zero and \u223c 0.5. We\nchoose 0.25 as representative [15]. The smearing parameters finally are needed to account for the broadening and\nthe in\u2013gap current.\nThe low\u2013temperature spectra from different junctions\non samples A and B are shown in Fig. 4 to demonstrate\nthe reproducibility of the data. Note that all\n3\n\n\frule out proximity effects.\nIn conclusion, we have reproducibly observed a small\nenergy gap, \u22061 \u223c 2.5 meV, which smoothly closes near\nthe bulk Tc . This observation, along with a detailed analysis of the conductance spectra, is indicative that MgB2\nis an example of the rarely observed phenomenon of two\u2013\nband superconductivity. While the measured gap values\nare consistent with the first principles two\u2013band model\nthat assumes pair exchange between bands [4], our spectra are providing strong evidence that interband quasiparticle exchange is important. The data are inconsistent with surface layers of reduced Tc or with proximity\neffects.\nWe gratefully acknowledge helpful discussions with M.\nR. Norman, G. B. Arnold, B. Jank\u00f3 and C. P.

Low temperature SIS tunneling spectra. The measured data (dots) is normalized to a smooth background. For\none set of data the fit (thin solid line) to a small (intrinsic) BCS s\u2013wave gap is shown along with a fit (thick solid\nline) to an induced gap. The parameters used are \u2206ph\n1 = 0,\n\u2217\n\u2206ph\n=\n7.2\nmeV,\n\u0393\n=\n4.0\nmeV,\n\u0393\n=\n1.0\nmeV,\n\u0393\n=\n0.5\nmeV\n1\n2\n1\n2\nand \u0393\u22172 = 1.0 meV. See text for details.\n\ncharacteristic features of the data taken on sample B,\nsuch as the gap magnitude and the additional structure\noutside the conductance peaks, coincide with those from\nsample A. For one junction (# 3), the result of a two\u2013\nband fit is given along with the BCS model including\na smearing of \u0393 = 0.5 meV. The BCS fit convincingly\nreproduces the in\u2013gap conductance and the quasiparticle peak, but it cannot account for the features near 9\nmV, which are consistently seen in these SIS junctions.\nThe two\u2013band fit is close to the BCS behavior for low\nbias, but it also reproduces the shoulder and dip at the\nobserved energy in agreement with the data. The higher\nenergy spectral feature is an effect of the large gap, \u22062 , on\nthe quasiparticle self\u2013energy in the 3d band DOS. Note\nthat the dip drops below unity, a characteristic feature of\nquasiparticle self\u2013energy effects, similar to phonon structures, but which cannot be achieved by arbitrarily adding\ntwo BCS DOS from the two bands. The subtlety of the\nfeature near 9 meV, as well as the dip, is more easily understood as an intrinsic feature of the 3d DOS. Our data\nshow no direct contribution from the 2d band [16].\nThe same formalism used above to calculate the conductances is valid for a proximity sandwich, P, consisting\nof N and S layers that are coupled by a tunnel barrier I [5],\ni.e. P \u2261 NIS. Well\u2013coupled N and S layers result in spectral features inconsistent with our observations [17]. For\nP \u2261 NIS, the small gap in the N region has been shown\nto decrease exponentially with barrier thickness [18]. To\nexplain the small gap of MgB2 as a surface proximity effect (i.e., PIP' for our SIS geometry) would produce a\nnoticeable splitting of the zero\u2013bias peak (Fig. 2) unless\nthe gaps in P and P' differed by less than \u223c 20%. This is\nhighly unlikely as it would require [18] the tunneling barrier thicknesses in P for all MgB2 samples to be within\n\u223c 0.5 \u00c5. Thus it is our SIS geometry that allows us to\n\n[1] G.

It\ntherefore is safe to neglect \u2206ph\n1 for our purpose.\n[15] Since \u03931,2 are interband scattering rates, their ratio is\nexpected to be related to the ratio of the DOS in both\nbands, N1 /N2 . However, due to the complicated geometry of the Fermi surface, it is not evident to us that all\nquasiparticles participate in the interband scattering and\nwe therefore do not expect to find \u03932 /\u03931 = N1 /N2 .\n[16] In principle, three channels contribute in parallel to the\ntotal current in two\u2013band SIS junctions.
