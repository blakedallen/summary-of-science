Assuming a pole dominance parameterization of the form factors, we present a parametric analysis of the pseudoscalar semileptonic decays\nD 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd and D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd from the FOCUS experiment.\nThis paper concentrates on the relative branching ratio and the form factor\nratio of the Cabibbo suppressed decay relative to the Cabibbo favored mode.\n2\n\n\fSince the efficiency tends to have a non-negligible q 2 dependence (see Figure 3),\nwe allow the pole masses and the ratio f\u2212 (0)/f+ (0) to vary freely in the fit.\nThe results and description of the detailed analysis of the pole masses and\nf\u2212 (0)/f+ (0) are included in another paper [1] along with a non-parametric\nanalysis of the high statistics decay D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd .\nWe report a new measurement for the branching ratio \u0393(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd)/\u0393(K \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd)\nin agreement with recent results from the CLEO collaboration [2,3]. These\nresults indicate a lower value for this branching ratio than the one reported\nin the PDG [4]. We also report a new measurement of the form factor ratio\n\u03c0 (0)\nf+\nK\nf+ (0)\n\nwith greatly improved errors with respect to existing measurements\n\nand compare it to recent theoretical predictions from an unquenched Lattice\nQCD calculation [5,6] .\n\n2\n\nData Selection\n\nThis analysis is based on data collected by the FOCUS experiment during\nthe 1996\u201397 fixed target run at Fermilab. FOCUS is a photoproduction experiment which collected a large sample of charm decays produced in the\ninteractions of a photon beam [7] with an average energy of \u223c 180 GeV on\na BeO segmented target. The FOCUS spectrometer [8,9,10,11] is equipped\nwith a 16 plane silicon strip vertex detector; 4 planes are interleaved with the\ntargets and 12 planes are located downstream of the target area. Momentum\nanalysis is accomplished by two magnets with opposite polarities and 5 multiwire proportional chambers. Three multi-cell threshold \u010cerenkov counters\nprovide charged particle identification. A muon counter located at the end of\nthe spectrometer is responsible for muon identification.\nWe reconstruct the semileptonic decays D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd and D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd requiring a D \u2217+ -tag where the D \u2217+ is reconstructed in the D 0 \u03c0 + final state. 1\nWhenever possible we apply identical selection criteria to both decay modes\nto reduce systematic effects. As the decay D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd has more background\nand less statistics, the selection cuts have been optimized for this mode. The\nsignal and normalization samples are selected requiring two opposite charged\ntracks form a good vertex with a confidence level greater than 1%. One of\nthe two tracks from the D 0 decay vertex must be identified as a muon from\nthe inner muon detector with a confidence level greater than 1% and must\nhave momentum greater than 10 GeV/c. To suppress pion and kaon in-flight\ndecays, this track is required to have a consistent momentum when measured\nin the first and second magnets. The other track must satisfy a \u010cerenkov re1\n\nThroughout this paper charge conjugate modes are implied.\n\n3\n\n\fquirement based on the value of the negative log-likelihood W for a given\nhypothesis: in the D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd mode, the pion must be favored with respect\nto the kaon hypothesis by at least 3 units of likelihoods (W (K) \u2212 W (\u03c0) > 3);\nin the case of K \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd the kaon must be favored over the pion hypothesis by 3\nunits of likelihoods (W (\u03c0) \u2212 W (K) > 3). To reduce non-charm background,\nthe candidate hadron must have a momentum greater than 14 GeV/c. The\nprimary vertex is found after excluding the candidate tracks from the D 0\ndecay vertex; the remaining tracks are used to form candidate vertices. Of\nthese vertices we choose the one with highest multiplicity and we break ambiguities by picking the most upstream vertex as the primary vertex. This\nvertex is required to be isolated from other tracks in the silicon strip vertex detector by requiring that the confidence level of any another track not\nused in the determination of the primary or decay vertex be less than 1%.\nFor each hadron-lepton combination that satisfies the above requirements,\nanother track coming from the primary vertex must be found as the candidate \"soft\" pion from the D \u2217+ \u2192 D 0 \u03c0s+ . The \u03c0s+ candidate must not have the\npion hypothesis strongly disfavored over all other particle hypotheses from the\n\u010cerenkov system (min{W (e), W (K), W (p)} \u2212 W (\u03c0) > \u22126). It must also have\na momentum greater than 2.5 GeV/c. To suppress backgrounds from decays\nwhere a final state particle is lost (usually \u03c0 0 ), such as K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 , K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ,\n\u03c1\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd and K\u03c0\u03bc+ \u03bd 2 , we place a lower cut on the hadron-lepton invariant\nmass (visible mass) of 1.0 GeV/c2 . Contamination from D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + is eliminated by requiring the visible mass to be less than 1.7 GeV/c2 .\nSince the neutrino is not reconstructed, the resultant smearing effects on the\nresolution play an important factor in this analysis. Rather than using the\nstandard neutrino closure resulting in a two-fold ambiguity on the D 0 momentum, we take advantage of the D \u2217+ -tag by boosting the final state particles in\nthe hadron-lepton center of mass frame.

The amount of non-peaking background is found from a\nfit to q 2 and D \u2217+ \u2212 D 0 mass difference distributions.

This is achieved by re-weighting\neach Monte Carlo event according to the ratio of the probability that the event\n\u2032\nwas generated with a pole mass Mpole\nand a form factor ratio \u03b7 \u2032 relative to the\nprobability that the event was generated with the default values MDs\u2217 (MD\u2217\nfor \u03c0\u03bc\u03bd ) and \u03b7 0 . 6 The relative efficiencies of the decays D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd and\nD 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd are defined as the ratio of the reconstructed and generated\nMonte Carlo events.

[1].\n\nUsing the yields from the fit it is possible to obtain the ratio of the form\nfactors f+\u03c0 (0)/f+K (0). In order to do this we compute a numerical integration\nof the differential decay rate modulated by the reconstruction efficiency as a\nfunction of the q 2 [15]. This efficiency is found by sampling the q 2 Monte Carlo\ndistribution and dividing the reconstructed events by the generated events in\neach bin. The resultant distribution is then fit to a third degree polynomial\n(Fig. 3) which is used in the computation of the integral.

The fitting procedure was tested on a Monte Carlo set whose size is\nroughly 20 times the FOCUS data set and we verified that the fit returned\nthe input values used in our simulation.\nWe checked for possible biases as well as the accuracy of our statistical error by\nperforming a fit on fluctuated data distributions multiple times and comparing\nthe mean and width of the distribution of the fit results to our measurement.\nWe found that we have to add a 0.005 contribution to the systematic error\nto compensate for K \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd and K\u03c0\u03bc+ \u03bd contributions that were not allowed\nto float in the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd fit. We also performed an analogous study using the\nfit function as the parent distribution to establish how well our fit function\ndescribed the data. We compared the likelihood obtained from our measurement to the distribution of the likelihoods from the fluctuated fit function.\nWe found good agreement indicating that our fit function well represents the\ndata.\nWe investigated the stability of our results by changing a variety of selection\ncriteria: the significance of separation between the primary and secondary vertex, muon identification, track momenta, visible mass cut, and \u010cerenkov identification. We found no significant change in our results and assign a systematic\nuncertainty of 0.003 on the branching ratio due to cut variations. This number\nis found by computing the variance of this set of results.\nWe further investigated fit variations by using a different approach in which\nwe fit the q 2 and D \u2217+ \u2212 D 0 mass difference. Rather than fitting the K \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd\ndistribution first, this fit was performed simultaneously on the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd and\nK \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd samples. The results are nearly identical to the results obtained from\nthe fit to q 2 and cos \u03b8l . Other fit variations include changing the bin size. By\ncomputing the variance of these a priori likely results, we assigned a systematic\nuncertainty of 0.004 from fit variations.\nSince the Monte Carlo is used to determine the amount of K \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd background\nin the \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd sample, we are sensitive to the simulated misidentification rate.\n10\n\n\fWe used the high statistics modes D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + and D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 + where no\n\u010cerenkov requirement was applied to measure the K \u2192 \u03c0 misidentification\nrate and we used the statistical error on the combined sample (after applying\nthe same \u010cerenkov requirement used to select the D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd events) to assign a systematic uncertainty. We varied the misidentification rate so obtained\nby \u00b11\u03c3, and we find a contribution of 0.002 to the total systematic error.\nThe contributions to the systematic error on the branching ratio and the\ncorresponding contributions to the error on the form factor ratio f+\u03c0 (0)/f+K (0)\nare listed in Table 1.\nBR\n\nf+\u03c0 (0)/f+K (0)\n\nFluctuated data distribution\n\n0.005\n\n0.029\n\nCut variations\n\n0.003\n\n0.017\n\nFit variations\n\n0.004\n\n0.023\n\n\u010cerenkov misidentification\n\n0.002\n\n0.011\n\nTotal\n\n0.007\n\n0.042\n\nTable 1\nSources of systematic errors and relative uncertainties.

We varied the bin size and fit functions. We find\na contribution to the systematic error of 0.010 which is added in quadrature\nto the errors propagated from the branching ratio measurement.\n\n5\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWe quote the final results as:\n\u0393(D 0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd)\n= 0.074 \u00b1 0.008 (stat.) \u00b1 0.007 (sys.)\n\u0393(D 0 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bd)\n\n(14)\n\nand\nVcd\nVcs\n\n2\n\nf+\u03c0 (0)\nf+K (0)\n\n2\n\n= 0.037 \u00b1 0.004 (stat.) \u00b1 0.004 (sys.).\n\n11\n\n(15)\n\n\f|2 = 0.051 \u00b10.001 from unitarity constraints, we find the form factor\nUsing | VVcd\ncs\nratio to be:\nf+\u03c0 (0)\n= 0.85 \u00b1 0.04 (stat.) \u00b1 0.04 (sys.) \u00b1 0.01 (CKM)\nf+K (0)\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the last error (CKM) corresponds to the uncertainty on the ratio |Vcd /Vcs |.\nWe compare our results to the measurement reported by the CLEO collaboration in Ref.
