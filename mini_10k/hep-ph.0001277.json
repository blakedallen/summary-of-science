INTRODUCTION\n\nThe production of photons by circular motion of charged particle in accelerator is one\nof the most interesting problems in the classical and quantum electrodynamics.\nIn this paper we are interested in the synergic photon production initiated by the circular\nmotion of electron and positron in the homogenous magnetic field. It is supposed that\nelectron and positron are moving at the opposite angular velocities. This process is the\ngeneralization of the one-charge synergic synchrotron \u010cerenkov radiation which has been\ncalculated in source theory two decades ago by Schwinger et al. [1]. We will follow also\nthe article [2] as the starting point. Although our final problem is the radiation of the twocharge system in vacuum, we consider, first in general, the presence of dielectric medium,\nwhich is represented by the phenomenological index of refraction n and it is well known\nthat this phenomenological constant depends on the external magnetic field. Introducing\nthe phenomenological constant enables to consider also the \u010cerenkovian processes.\nWe will investigate here how the original Schwinger et al. spectral formula of the\nsynergic synchrotron \u010cerenkov radiation of the charged particle is modified if we consider\nthe electron and positron moving at the opposite angular velocities. This problem is an\nanalogue of the linear problem solved recently by author [3] also in source theory. We will\nshow that the original spectral formula of the synergic synchrotron-\u010cerenkov radiation\nis modulated by function 4 sin2 (\u03c9t) where \u03c9 is the frequency of the synergic radiation\nproduced by the system and it does not depend on the orbital angular frequency of\nelectron or positron. We will use here the fundamental ingredients of Schwinger source\ntheory to determine the power spectral formula.\nSource theory [4\u20136] was initially constructed for a description of the particle physics\nsituations occurring in high-energy physics experiments. It enables simplification of the\ncalculations in the electrodynamics and gravity where the interactions are mediated by the\nphoton or graviton, respectively. It simplifies particularly the calculations with radiative\ncorrections [6,7].\n\n\fII. FORMULATION OF A PROBLEM\n\nThe basic formula of the Schwinger source theory is the so called vacuum to vacuum\namplitude:\ni\n\nh0+ |0\u2212 i = e h\u0304 W ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere in case of the electromagnetic field in the medium, the action W is given by the\nfollowing formula:\nW =\n\n1\n2c2\n\nZ\n\n(dx)(dx\u2032 )J \u03bc (x)D+\u03bc\u03bd (x \u2212 x\u2032 )J \u03bd (x\u2032 ),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\u03bc \u03bc\u03bd\n[g + (1 \u2212 n\u22122 )\u03b2 \u03bc \u03b2 \u03bd ]D+ (x \u2212 x\u2032 ),\nc\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n=\nD+\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b2 \u03bc \u2261 (1, 0), J \u03bc \u2261 (c\u033a, J) is the conserved current, \u03bc is the magnetic permeability\n\u221a\nof the medium, \u01eb is the dielectric constant od the medium and n = \u01eb\u03bc is the index of\nrefraction of the medium. Function D+ is defined as follows [1]:\ni\nD+ (x \u2212 x ) = 2\n4\u03c0 c\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03c9\n\nsin n\u03c9\n|x \u2212 x\u2032 | \u2212i\u03c9|t\u2212t\u2032 |\nc\ne\n.\n|x \u2212 x\u2032 |\n\n(4)\n\nThe probability of the persistence of vacuum follows from the vacuum amplitude (1) in\nthe following form:\n2\n\n|h0+ |0\u2212 i|2 = e\u2212 h\u0304 ImW ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Im W is the basis for the definition of the spectral function P (\u03c9, t) as follows:\n2\nd\n\u2212 Im W = \u2212\nh\u0304\n\nZ\n\ndtd\u03c9\n\nP (\u03c9, t)\n.\nh\u0304\u03c9\n\n(6)\n\nNow, if we insert eq. (2) into eq. (6), we get after extracting P (\u03c9, t) the following\ngeneral expression for this spectral function:\n\"\n#\nn\u03c9\n\u2032\nsin\n|x\n\u2212\nx\n|\n\u03c9 \u03bc Z\nc\n\u00d7\nP (\u03c9, t) = \u2212 2 2 dxdx\u2032 dt\u2032\n4\u03c0 n\n|x \u2212 x\u2032 |\n\ncos[\u03c9(t \u2212 t\u2032 )][\u033a(x, t)\u033a(x\u2032 , t\u2032 ) \u2212\n\nn2\nJ(x, t) * J(x\u2032 , t\u2032 )].\nc2\n\n(7)\n\nLet us recall that the last formula can be derived also in the classical electrodynamical\ncontext as it is shown for instance in the Schwinger article [8]. The derivation of the\npower spectral formula from the vacuum amplitude is more simple.\n\n\fIII. THE POWER SPECTRAL FORMULA OF MOTION OF OPPOSITE CHARGES\n\nNow, we will apply the formula (7) to the two-body system with the opposite charges\nmoving at the oposite angular velocities in order to get in general synergic synchrotron\u010cerenkov radiation of electron and positron moving in a uniform magnetic field.\nWhile the synchrotron radiation is generated in a vacuum, the synergic synchrotron\u010cerenkov radiation can produced only in a medium with dielectric constant n. We suppose\nthe circular motion with velocity v in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the\nconstant magnetic field H (chosen to be in the +z direction).\nThe condition for the existence of the \u010cerenkov electromagnetic radiation is that the\nvelocity of a charged particle in a medium is faster than the speed of light in this medium.\nThis radiation was first observed experimentally by \u010cerenkov [9] and theoretically interpreted by Tamm and Frank [10] in the framework of classical electrodynamics. A source\ntheoretical description of this effect was given by Schwinger, Tsai and Erber [1] at the\nzero-temperature regime and the classical spectral formula was generalized to the finite\ntemperature situation in electrodynamics and gravity in the framework of the source theory by Pardy [11, 12]. Here we derive the general formula of the radiation generated by\nthe motion of two-body system in a uniform magnetic field. Later we consider only the\nprocess in vacuum.\nWe can write the following formulas for the charge density \u033a and for the current density\nJ of the two-body system with opposite charges and opposite angular velocities:\n\u033a(x, t) = e\u03b4(x \u2212 x1 (t)) \u2212 e\u03b4(x \u2212 x2 (t))\n\n(8)\n\nJ(x, t) = ev1 (t)\u03b4(x \u2212 x1 (t)) \u2212 ev2 (t)\u03b4(x \u2212 x2 (t))\n\n(9)\n\nx1 (t) = x(t) = R(i cos(\u03c90 t) + j sin(\u03c90 t)),\n\n(10)\n\nx2 (t) = R(i cos(\u2212\u03c90 t) + j sin(\u2212\u03c90 t) = x(\u2212\u03c90 , t) = x(\u2212t).\n\n(11)\n\nand\n\nwith\n\nThe absolute values of velocities of both particles are the same, or |v1 (t)| = |v2 (t)| = v,\nwhere (H = |H|, E = energy of a particle)\nv(t) = dx/dt,\n\n\u03c90 = v/R,\n\nR=\n\n\u03b2E\n,\neH\n\n\u03b2 = v/c,\n\nv = |v|.\n\n(12)\n\nAfter insertion of eqs.

that the original synchrotron spectrum generated by electron is modulated\nby function 4 sin2 (\u03c9t). This formula is analogical to the formula derived in [3] for the\nlinear motion of the two-charge system emitting the \u010cerenkov radiation. The derived\nformula involves also the synergic process composed from the synchrotron radiation and\nthe \u010cerenkov radiation for electron velocity v > c/n in a medium.\nOur goal is to apply the last formula in situation where there is a vacuum. In this case\nwe can put \u03bc = 1, n = 1 in the last formula and so we have\nZ 2l\u03b2\ne2 \u03c9\u03c90\nPl (\u03c9, t) = 4 sin (\u03c9t)\n2\u03b2 2 J2l\u2032 (2l\u03b2) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )\ndxJ2l (x) .\n\u03c0 v\n0\n!\n\n2\n\n(47)\n\nSo, we see, that final formula describing the opposite motion of eletron and positron in\naccelerator is of the form\nPl (\u03c9, t) = 4 sin2 (\u03c9t) Pl(electron) (\u03c9) ,\n\n(48)\n\nwhere Pelectron is the spectrum of radiation only of electron. The result is suprising because\nwe naively expected that the total radiation of the opposite charges should be\nPl (\u03c9, t) = Pl(electron) (\u03c9, t) + Pl(positron) (\u03c9, t) .\n\n(49)\n\nSo, we see that the resulting radiation can not be considerred as generated by the\nisolated particles but by a synergical production of a system of particles and magnetic\nfield. At the same time we cannot interprete the result as a result of interference of two\nsources because the distance between sources radically changes and so, the condition of\nan interference is not fulfilled.\nUsing the approximative formulae\nJ2l\u2032 (2l\u03b2)\nZ\n\n0\n\n2l\u03b2\n\n1 1\n\u223c\u221a\n3\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\n3\n2lc\n\n1 1\nJ2l (y)dy \u223c \u221a\n3\u03c0\n\n\u00132/3\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nl/lc\n\nK2/3 (l/lc ),\n\nl \u226b 1,\n\n(50)\n\nK1/3 (y)dy,\n\nl \u226b 1,\n\n(51)\n\nwith [1]\n3\nlc = (1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 )\u22123/2 ,\n2\n\n(52)\n\nsubstituting eqs.

The classical\nelectrodynamics is not broken by this formula but our naive image on the processes in the\nmagnetic field is broken. From the last formula also follows that at time t = \u03c0k/\u03c9 there\nis no radiation of the frequency \u03c9. At every frequency \u03c9 the spectrum oscillates with\nfrequency \u03c9. If the radiation were generated not synergically, then the spectral formula\nwould be composed from two parts corresponding to two isolated sources.\nIV. DISCUSSION\n\nWe have derived in this article the power spectrum formula of the synchrotron radiation generated by the electron and positron moving at the opposite angular velocities in\nhomogenous magnetic field. We have used the Schwinger version of quantum field theory,\nfor its simplicity. It is suprising that the spectrum depends periodically on radiation frequency \u03c9 which means that the system composed from electron, positron and magnetic\nfield behaves as a pulsar. While such pulsar can be represented by a terrestrial experimental arrangement it is possioble to consider also the cosmological existence in some\nmodified form.\nTo our knowledge, our result is not involved in the classical monographies on the electromagnetic theory and at the same time it was not still studied by the accelerator experts\ninvestigating the synchrotron radiation of bunches. This effect was not described in textbooks on classical electromagnetic field and on the synchrotron radiation. We hope that\nsooner or later this effect will be verified by the accelerator physicists.\nThe radiative corrections obviously influence the synergic spectrum of photons [2,7].\nHowever, the goal of this article is restricted only to the simple processes.\n\n\fThe particle laboratory LEP in CERN uses instead of single electron and positron the\nbunches with 1010 electrons or positrons in one bunch of volume 300\u03bcm \u00d7 40\u03bcm \u00d7 0.01\nm. So, in some approximation we can replace the charge of electron and positron by\nthe charges Q and -Q of both bunches in order to get the realistic intensity of photons.\nNevertheless the synergic character of the radiation of two bunches moving at the opposite\ndirection in a magnetic field is conserved. The more exact description can be obtained in\ncase we consider the internal structure of both bunches. But this is not the goal of our\narticle.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n\nJ. Schwinger, W. Y. Tsai and T. Erber, Ann. Phys. (NY) 96 (1976) 303.\nM. Pardy, Phys.
