A correlation between \u03b1ox and\nz implies evolution of the accretion process. We present a qualitative comparison of these new\nresults with models for accretion disk emission.\nSubject headings: accretion disks - quasars: general - ultraviolet: galaxies - X-rays: galaxies\n- methods:statistical\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt is widely accepted that the extraordinary activity associated with quasars involves accretion onto a\nsupermassive black hole, with the UV/optical emission arising from a geometrically thin, optically thick cold\naccretion disk, and the X-ray continuum arising from a hot, optically thin corona that Compton upscatters\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n\nthe disk's UV photons. The geometry of the X-ray emitting region is uncertain, but possibilities include\nan accretion disk that evaporates into a hot inner flow (e.g., Shapiro et al. 1976; Zdziarski et al. 1999), a\nhot ionized 'skin' that sandwiches the cold disk (e.g., Bisnovatyi-Kogan & Blinnikov 1977; Liang & Price\n1977; Nayakshin 2000), a combination of a hot inner flow and a corona that sandwiches the disk (e.g.,\nPoutanen et al. 1997; Sobolewska et al. 2004a), or a patchy corona, consisting of a number of hot spots\nabove the accretion disk (e.g., Galeev et al. 1979; Malzac et al. 2001; Sobolewska et al. 2004b). In addition,\nthe UV and X-ray producing processes may be coupled as a result of radiation pressure from the UV photons\ndriving a flow from the disk into the corona (Proga 2005). Investigating the relationships between the UV and\nX-ray emission is an important step towards understanding the origin of the X-ray emission. Furthermore,\nlearning how the X-ray and UV emission change with z provides insight into evolution of the accretion\nprocess, quasar black hole mass, and accretion rate.\nMany studies have investigated whether \u03b1ox , the ratio of X-ray to UV/optical flux, depends on redshift or\nUV luminosity, LUV (e.g., Avni & Tananbaum 1982; Wilkes et al. 1994; Yuan et al. 1998a; Bechtold et al.\n2003; Vignali et al. 2003b; Strateva et al. 2005; Steffen et al. 2006). The parameter \u03b1ox is a simple measure of the amount of X-ray radiation, dominated by non-thermal processes, in respect to the amount of\nUV radtion, dominated by thermal processes. Most studies have concluded that there is no evidence for\na redshift dependence of \u03b1ox (e.g., Avni & Tananbaum 1986; Wilkes et al. 1994; Strateva et al. 2005), although Bechtold et al. (2003) argued that \u03b1ox is significantly correlated with both z and UV luminosity,\nand Yuan et al. (1998a) found evidence for a slight dependence of \u03b1ox on redshift at z < 0.5. Vignali et al.\n(2003b), Strateva et al. (2005, S05), and Steffen et al. (2006, S06) used a partial correlation and regression\nanalysis to conclude that there is no evidence for a dependence of \u03b1ox on z, after accounting for the \u03b1ox \u2013\nLUV and LUV \u2013z correlations. These authors also found evidence that RQQs become more X-ray quiet with\nincreasing UV luminosity.\nPrevious investigations of the X-ray photon index, \u0393X , have also produced mixed results. Bechtold et al.\n(2003) used a sample of ROSAT observations over from Yuan et al. (1998a) and Chandra observations of\nhigh redshift quasars to conclude that \u0393X is correlated with both luminosity and z. A \u0393X \u2013LUV correlation\nwas also seen by Dai et al. (2004), using a sample of gravitationally-lensed sources with XMM-Newton and\nChandra data. Some evidence for an anti-correlation between \u0393X and z has also been found using ASCA\nobservations (Reeves et al. 1997; Vignali et al. 1999) and XMM-Newton observations (Page et al. 2003).\nHowever, other investigations based on XMM-Newton data (e.g., Risaliti & Elvis 2005) and spectral fitting\nof composite spectra from Chandra observations (e.g., Vignali et al. 2003c, 2005; Shemmer et al. 2006) have\nnot revealed any evidence for a relationship between \u0393X , LUV , and z. Similarly, other ASCA observations\nhave also not produced evidence for a \u0393X \u2013z correlation (Reeves & Turner 2000). In addition, there has\nbeen evidence for a correlation between \u0393X and the Eddington ratio (e.g., Lu & Yu 1999; Wang et al. 2004;\nShemmer et al. 2006), and Gallagher et al. (2005) found evidence for an anti-correlation between \u0393X and\nthe UV spectral slope.\nAll of these conclusions are by necessity based on flux-limited samples. Flux-limited samples typically\nsuffer from an artificial correlation between z and LUV , making it difficult to disentangle which parameter is\nmore important in determining X-ray properties. To help break the LUV \u2013z degeneracy, we observed seven\noptically faint z \u223c 4 radio-quiet quasars with Chandra. We combined these sources with Chandra data of\noptically-selected radio-quiet quasars, drawn mostly from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York et al.\n2000), to create a flux-limited sample of 174 sources, 90% of which have detections. Because the X-ray\nemission in radio-loud sources can have an additional component from the jet (e.g., Zamorani et al. 1981;\nWilkes & Elvis 1987), we focus our analysis on the radio-quiet majority. We use these sources to perform a\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n\nmultivariate analysis of \u03b1ox , \u0393X , LUV , and z in a manner that allows us to effectively separate the dependence\nof the X-ray spectral properties on LUV and z.\nWe adopt a cosmology based on the the WMAP best-fit parameters (h = 0.71, \u03a9m = 0.27, \u03a9\u039b = 0.73,\nSpergel et al. 2003). For ease of notation, we define lUV \u2261 log \u03bdL\u03bd (2500\u00c5), and lX \u2261 log \u03bdL\u03bd (2 keV).\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND COMPARISON SAMPLE\n\nThe new observations targeted seven non-BAL RQQs with z > 4 from the literature. These were known\nto be among the faintest (\u03bdL\u03bd (2500\u00c5) . 3 \u00d7 1046 ergs s\u22121 ) z \u223c 4 optically-selected quasars to be observed\nthus far by Chandra or XMM-Newton. All seven were observed on-axis on the ACIS-S3 chip with exposure\ntimes 10\u201323 ksec. The exposure times were chosen in order to ensure that the X-ray source would be detected\nif \u03b1ox < 1.9. All targets were, in fact, detected. The new observations are summarized in Table 1.\nThe other z & 4 sources were selected from the literature (Bechtold et al. 2003; Vignali et al. 2001,\n2003a), and had been observed as targeted observations with Chandra. The z . 4 sources were found by\ncross-correlating the SDSS DR3 quasar catalogue (Schneider et al. 2005) with the Chandra public archive\nas of 2005 February 22. We selected those SDSS DR3 quasars that were serendipitiously within 12\u2032 of a\nChandra target. The radio-quiet sources were selected to have Ri = 0.4(i\u2212t1.4GHz ) < 1.5 (Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2004),\nwhere, t1.4GHz is the FIRST 1.4 GHz AB magnitude, and i is the SDSS i-band magnitude. The radio-loud\nsources were omitted because such sources have an additional component of X-ray emission arising from the\njet (e.g., Wilkes & Elvis 1987; Worrall et al. 1987). Almost all of the z < 4 quasars have their Chandra data\nreported here for the first time.\nThe optical/UV spectra for each source were inspected by eye to exclude the BALs or any sources that\nhad significant absorption. It is necessary to remove the BAL QSOs because their high column density gives\nthem the appearance of being X-ray weak (e.g., Green et al. 2001; Gallagher et al. 2002, 2006), potentially\nbiasing our analysis. We are unable to remove the high-ionization BAL quasars for z < 1.5, as their\nidentification requires observations of the C IV line. We are able to remove low-ionization BALs at 0.45 <\nz < 2.25 based on Mg II absorption. Reichard et al. (2003) found the fraction of BALs in the SDSS to\nbe \u223c 14%, and therefore we expect there to be 13 \u00b1 3 BALs in our sample at z < 1.5. We did not\ninclude seven sources with an obvious contribution in their spectra from the host-galaxy. Host-galaxy\ncontamination is likely negligible for all included sources, except for possibly the lowest luminosity quasars,\nsince \u03bdL\u2217\u03bd \u223c 1044 ergs s\u22121 at 2500\u00c5 for galaxies (Budav\u00e1ri et al. 2005).\nWe visually inspected the Chandra events files to find those sources that fell on an ACIS chip. We did\nnot include any sources that were observed on chip S4 due to higher read-out noise (Data Caveats on CIAO\nweb pages 1 ). All X-ray sources reported are within 1\"\u20132\" of the optical position. The archival sources and\ntheir X-ray properties are listed in Table 2.\nAltogether, the sample consists of 174 radio-quiet quasars, with a broad range in redshift (0.1 < z < 4.7)\nand luminosity (1044 ergs s\u22121 . \u03bdL\u03bd (2500\u00c5) . 1048 ergs s\u22121 ). All sources have been observed with the\nChandra X-ray Observatory using the ACIS-S or ACIS-I detectors, and 157 (90%) of them are detected. The\n(LUV , z) distribution of the sample is shown in Figure 1.\n1 http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/caveats\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\n2.1.\n\nX-ray Spectra\n\nSource extraction was done using CIAO 3.2.22 and CALDB 3.1. We extracted the PHA spectrum for\nall 174 sources using a circular aperture with radius chosen to include 95% of 3.5 keV photons. Typical\nextraction regions range from 5\" for on-axis sources, to 10\"\u201330\" for most off-axis sources. The background\nwas extracted from an annular region centered on the source, and any nearby sources were removed from\nthe extraction regions. A correction for pileup was necessary for only one source in our sample, MRK 1014.\nThe distribution of source counts is shown in Figure 2.\nSpectral fitting was done using the CIAO tool SHERPA (Freeman et al. 2001). We estimated the\nparameters for a power law of the form\nN (E) = n0\n\n\u0012\n\nE\n1 keV\n\n\u0013\u2212\u0393X\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u0393X is the photon index and n0 is the normalization at 1 keV, in units of photons keV\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121 . We\nrestricted our fits to energies 0.3\u20137.0 keV, and included Galactic absorption with NH fixed to that inferred\nfrom 21 cm maps (COLDEN3 Dickey & Lockman 1990). If the source had < 200 counts, we fit the unbinned\nspectrum using the Cash statistic (Cash 1979). For these sources, the background was fit simultaneously\nwith Equation (1) using an empirically determined background for the ACIS-S and ACIS-I, respectively. If\nthe source had < 50 counts, we calculated n0 by fixing \u0393X = 1.9, a typical value for RQQs (Reeves & Turner\n2000; Piconcelli et al. 2003). We also estimate \u0393X for these sources, but fix \u0393X = 1.9 when calculating n0\nto stabilize the estimates of LX and \u03b1ox . We fit n0 and \u0393X simultaneously for sources with counts between\n50 and 200. If the source had > 200 counts, we fit the binned spectrum by minimizing \u03c72 and included an\nintrinsic neutral absorber if justified by the data; only two of the sources with > 200 counts showed evidence\n21\nfor intrinsic absorption. These were 1438+0335 and 0958+0734, with intrinsic NH = 5.34+0.745\ncm\u22122\n\u22120.203 \u00d7 10\n+2.034\n22\n\u22122\nand NH = 1.363\u22120.626 \u00d7 10 cm , respectively; the errors are at 95% confidence. The background for the\n> 200 count sources was binned and subtracted before spectral fitting. There were 86 sources with < 50\ncounts, 44 sources with between 50 and 200 counts, and 44 sources with > 200 counts.\nWe included an intrinsic neutral absorber for sources 0259+0048, 0918+5139, 1002+5542, and 1411+5205,\ndespite the fact that they have < 200 counts. These sources initially exhibited unusually hard X-ray spectra\n(\u0393X . 1), so we fit \u0393X and NH simultaneously to test if these low values of \u0393X were caused by unrecognized absorption. Even after including an absorber at the quasar redshift, sources 0259+0048, 0918+5139,\nand 1002+5542 still have rather hard X-ray continua, with photon induces of 1.02 \u00b1 0.24, 0.92 \u00b1 0.33, and\n1.27 \u00b1 0.15, respectively. Such hard X-ray spectra could be the result of more complex absorption, such\nas an ionized or partial covering absorber. However, the low number of counts for these sources preclude\nobtaining meaningful spectral fits for more complex models. In addition, the mean \u0393X for our sample is \u2248 2\nand the observed dispersion in \u0393X for our sample is 0.44. Thus, we might expect to observe a few sources\nwith \u0393X \u223c 1 in a sample with 157 X-ray detected sources, and therefore these three sources are probably\nnot outliers but just represent the tail of the RQQ \u0393X distribution.\nSource 1411+5205 shows evidence for considerable absorption, NH \u223c 1023 cm\u22122 , and may be a BAL\nQSO. A 95% confidence interval on the column density for this source is 1.8 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 < NH < 2.45 \u00d7\n1023 cm\u22122 .\n2 Chandra\n3 For\n\nInteractive Analysis of Observations (CIAO), http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/\n\nCOLDEN, see http://cxc.harvard.edu/toolkit/colden.jsp\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nWe used the projection method in Sherpa to estimate a 3\u03c3 confidence interval on n0 . Those sources\nthat did not contain n0 = 0 in their 3\u03c3 confidence interval were considered detected, otherwise we set a 3\u03c3\nupper limit on n0 . For those sources with < 50 counts, the projection method was used to calculate the 68%\n(1\u03c3) individual confidence intervals on the power law parameters. We calculated the covariance matrix of\nthe parameters for those sources with > 50 counts.\nFifteen sources were in multiple observations. For each of these sources, all of the observations were fit\nsimultaneously assuming the same power-law spectrum.\nBased on our X-ray spectral fits, we estimate the mean value of \u0393X for our sample to be \u0393\u0304X = 2.033 \u00b1\n0.034, with an observed dispersion of 0.44. After accounting for the additional scatter in \u0393X caused by\nmeasurement error, we find that the intrinsic dispersion of \u0393X is \u223c 0.31. This is consistent with the dispersion\nfound in other studies (e.g., Piconcelli et al. 2005; Brocksopp et al. 2006; Grupe et al. 2006). The intrinsic\ndispersion in \u0393X is similar to the intrinsic dispersion in the optical/UV spectral slope (Richards et al. 2001).\n\n2.2.\n\nOptical/UV Spectra\n\nOptical spectra were obtained for most sources from the SDSS. We also obtained spectra for some of\nthe high redshift quasars from Anderson et al. (2001), P\u00e9roux et al. (2001), and Constantin et al. (2002).\nWe corrected the optical spectra for Galactic absorption using the E(B\u2212V ) values taken from Schlegel et al.\n(1998), as listed in the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), and the extinction curve of Cardelli et al.\n(1989), assuming a value of AV /E(B \u2212 V ) = 3.1. We model the continuum as a power law of the form\nf\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1 , and the Fe emission as a scaled and broadened iron template extracted from I Zw I in the\nUV by Vestergaard & Wilkes (2001). The continuum and iron emission were fit simultaneously using the\nLevenberg-Marquardt method for nonlinear \u03c72 -minimization. The continuum fitting windows are listed in\nTable 3. The median value of \u03b1 for our sample is 0.602, and the dispersion in \u03b1 is \u2248 0.4.\nWe were not able to obtain a spectrum for Q 0910+564. For this source, we calculated the flux density\nat 2500\u00c5 from the AB magnitude at 1450(1 + z)\u00c5 and the spectral index reported by (Schneider et al. 1991).\nWe were not able to use a power-law fit to calculate lUV for the z < 0.3 sources, as the SDSS spectral\nrange for these sources does not contain the rest-frame UV continuum. We therefore performed a linear\nregression of the dependence of lUV on log \u03bdL\u03bd (5100\u00c5) and \u03b1opt for higher redshift sources (0.3 < z <\n1.2) for which we had all three quantities. Here \u03b1opt is the spectral index of the optical continuum. Using\nthe regression results, lUV was then estimated for the z < 0.3 sources based on their optical luminosity\nand spectral index. The optical continuum parameters were found in the same manner as for the UV\ncontinuum, except that we used the Fe emission template from V\u00e9ron-Cetty et al. (2004). For sources\nwithin 0.3 < z < 1.2 the scatter about the regression fit resulted in a 'measurement' error on lUV of \u2248 0.07\ndex. For comparison, typical measurement errors on lUV for the z > 0.3 sources are \u2248 0.001\u20130.01 dex,\nignoring variability.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\n2.3.\n\n\u03b1ox\n\nWe calculate the ratio of optical to X-ray flux (Tananbaum et al. 1979) as\n\u03b1ox = \u2212\n\nlog(fX /fUV )\n,\nlog(\u03bdX /\u03bdUV )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere fX and fUV are the rest-frame flux densities at 2 keV and 2500\u00c5, respectively. If the flux density\nfrom 2500\u00c5 to 2 keV is a simple power law, then \u03b1ox is the spectral slope of this continuum, and thus \u03b1ox\nmay be thought of as a crude estimate of the shape of the ionizing continuum. The parameter \u03b1ox is an\nimportant parameter for model comparison, as it summarizes the amount of energy emitted in the X-ray\nregion (most likely a Comptonized component), compared with that emitted in the optical-UV (accretion\ndisk component). The mean \u03b1ox of our sample is \u1fb1ox = 1.49 \u00b1 0.01, and the dispersion of \u03b1ox is estimated\nto be \u03c3ox \u2248 0.19. Because some of the data points are censored, these estimates of the mean and dispersion\nof \u03b1ox were obtained by maximum-likelihood assuming a normal density. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the\nmean (e.g., Feigelson & Nelson 1985), a non-parametric estimate, gives \u1fb1ox = 1.49 \u00b1 0.06.\nIn Figure 3 we show the distributions of lX and \u03b1ox as functions of lUV and z. We report the X-ray\nand UV parameters in Table 4.\n\n3.\n\nDEPENDENCE OF \u03b1ox ON LUV AND z\n3.1.\n\nRegression Results\n\nIn order to study the relationship between \u03b1ox , optical/UV luminosity, and redshift, we performed a\nmultivariate regression of \u03b1ox on z and lUV . In our analysis, we perform the regression using several different\nparameteric models for the redshift and lUV dependencies. We compare the different models simultaneously\nusing the Kullback-Leibler information (KLI; Kullback & Leibler 1951), a well-studied method for comparing\ndata to models from information theory. In Appendix A, we describe KLI minimization in detail, and compare\nthis approach to classical statistical methods for testing for significance.\nCurrently, there is no a priori reason to assume a certain parameteric form for a dependence \u03b1ox on\nLUV and z. Initially, we are interested in testing for the existence of a dependence of \u03b1ox on redshift and\non UV luminosity, and we are not concerned with the particular parameteric forms of the possible redshift\nand luminosity dependencies. As described in Appendix A, the KLI is a particularly powerful tool for\ncomparing and testing several different parameteric models simultaneously, and is valid even if the 'correct'\nparameterization is not among those considered.\nWe compare models with redshift dependencies of the form LX \u221d e\u2212t(z)/t0 , LX \u221d ez/z0 , and LX \u221d\nl\n(1 + z)\u03b2\u03b6 , and LUV dependencies of the form LX \u221d L\u03b2UV\n. Here, t(z) is the age of the universe at z in units\nof Gyr. In addition, Steffen et al. (2006) found some evidence for a nonlinear dependence of \u03b1ox on lUV , and\nto test this we include models that contain a quadratic term for lUV .\nWe also tested for including the UV spectral slope, \u03b1UV , as one of the independent variables. However,\nwe found no evidence that \u03b1ox depended on \u03b1UV .\nEach of the statistical models considered here may be expressed as a normal density with variance \u03c3 2\nand mean E(\u03b1ox ) = \u1fb1ox (\u03b3). Here, E(\u03b1ox ) is the expectation value of \u03b1ox at a given lUV and z, and \u03b3 denotes\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nthe regression coefficients. The five models considered differ in their description of \u1fb1ox (\u03b3):\nMz : \u1fb1ox (\u03b3) = \u03b30 + \u03b3l lUV + \u03b3z z\n\n(3)\n\nM\u03b6 : \u1fb1ox (\u03b3) = \u03b30 + \u03b3l lUV + \u03b3\u03b6 log(1 + z)\n\n(4)\n\nMt : \u1fb1ox (\u03b3) = \u03b30 + \u03b3l lUV + \u03b3t t(z)\nMl : \u1fb1ox (\u03b3) = \u03b30 + \u03b3l lUV +\n\nMl+t : \u1fb1ox (\u03b3) = \u03b30 + \u03b3l lUV +\n\n2\n\u03b3l2 lUV\n2\n\u03b3l2 lUV\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\n+ \u03b3t t(z).\n\n(7)\n\nHere, we have introduced the notation that Mz stands for the model that parameterizes the average value\nof \u03b1ox as depending linearly on redshift, and similarly for the remaining four models. We do not include\nmodels with terms higher than quadratic in lUV because such models were estimated to give a poorer fit to\nthe data (cf. \u00a7 3.4). Model Mt is almost identical to the paramerization used by several other authors (e.g.,\nAT86, W94, S06), with the exception that other authors have used the fractional cosmological look-back\ntime, \u03c4 (z) = 1 \u2212 t(z)/t(0).\nBecause some of the values of lX are only upper limits, we employ the Expectation-Maximization (EM)\nalgorithm (Dempster, Laird, & Rubin 1977; Aitken 1981) to calculate the maximum-likelihood solution for\nthe regression parameters. These parameters are the regression coefficients, \u03b3, and the intrinsic variance\nabout the linear relationship, \u03c3 2 . The likelihood functions for these five models are normal densities with\nmeans given by Equations (3)\u2013(7). The regression is carried out directly on \u03b1ox = 0.384(lUV \u2212 lX + 2.605)\nusing computer routines coded by the authors.\nThe results of the regressions using the entire Chandra sample are\n\u1fb1ox\n\u1fb1ox\n\u1fb1ox\n\u1fb1ox\n\u1fb1ox\n\n= (\u22125.148 \u00b1 1.293) + (0.147 \u00b1 0.029)lUV \u2212 (0.014 \u00b1 0.018)z, \u03c3 = 0.157\n\n= (\u22127.048 \u00b1 1.443) + (0.190 \u00b1 0.033)lUV \u2212 (0.293 \u00b1 0.137) log(1 + z), \u03c3 = 0.155\n= (\u22128.816 \u00b1 1.473) + (0.223 \u00b1 0.031)lUV + (3.061 \u00b1 0.890) \u00d7 10\n= (62.83 \u00b1 30.48) \u2212 (2.816 \u00b1 1.336)lUV + (3.226 \u00b1 1.464) \u00d7\n\n= (24.22 \u00b1 32.88) \u2212 (1.212 \u00b1 1.428)lUV + (1.560 \u00b1 1.552) \u00d7\n(2.684 \u00b1 0.965) \u00d7 10\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\nt(z), \u03c3 = 0.151\n\n2\n10\u22122 lUV\n2\n10\u22122 lUV\n\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n\n, \u03c3 = 0.155\n\n(11)\n\n+\n\n(12)\n\nt(z), \u03c3 = 0.151.\n\n(13)\n\nFor all of these models, \u03b1ox increases (becomes more X-ray quiet) with increasing luminosity and decreases\n(becomes more X-ray loud) with increasing redshift. The intrinsic scatter about the relationships is estimated\nto be \u03c3 \u223c 0.15.\n3.2.\n\nEvidence for low-redshift BAL QSOs in the Sample\n\nThe estimates for the regression parameters are derived via maximum-likelihood. However, the likelihood functions assume that the residuals are normally distributed. If this assumption is not true, then\nit may bias our results. To test the assumption of normality in the residuals, in Figure 4 we compare the\ncumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standardized residuals for Mt with the standard normal.\nThe standardized residuals are the residuals normalized by the intrinsic scatter. The CDFs for the other\nmodels were very similar. As can be seen, there is evidence for a violation of the assumption of normality.\nA Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test confirmed this, finding a probability of \u2248 0.001\u20130.007 that the maximum\ndifference between the CDFs of the standardized residuals for the models and the standard normal is greater\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nthan that observed, assuming that the two distributions are the same. In addition, inspection of the residuals reveals that there are several sources that are significantly more X-ray quiet than would be expected\nfrom Equations (8)\u2013(13), and are therefore outliers. These sources are all censored (i.e., not detected in the\nX-rays) and at z < 1.5. As noted in \u00a7 2, the high column density of BAL QSOs gives them the appearance\nof being X-ray weak. Furthermore, we are unable to remove BALs at z < 1.5. These two facts suggests that\nthe regression outliers are BALs, as they are unusually X-ray weak and at z < 1.5.\nTo test the possibility that the z < 1.5 censored sources are dominated by BALs, and thus affecting our\nregression analysis, we removed these 10 sources and recalculated the regressions. Note that this number\nis consistent with the expected number of BALs in the z < 1.5 sample (cf., \u00a7 2). While this may remove\nsome non-BALs from the z < 1.5 sample, it is unlikely that removing a few censored non-BALs from the fit\nwill significantly affect the results, since these sources are not expected to be outliers and the regression is\ndominated by the detected sources. However, the BALs can have a non-negligible effect on the regression even\nif they are censored because they have an additional absorption component that contributes to the observed\nX-ray luminosity, and therefore are not expected to follow the functional form assumed by the regression and\ncan be outliers. The existence of outliers has the effect of biasing the estimate of the intrinsic scatter upwards,\ninflating the uncertainties on the regression coefficients, and therefore reducing the statistical significance of\nthe regression coefficients.\nAfter removing the z < 1.5 censored data points, we were left with a sample of 164 sources, 157 (96%)\nof which are detected. Performing the regressions on this second sample, we find\n\u1fb1ox\n\u1fb1ox\n\u1fb1ox\n\u1fb1ox\n\u1fb1ox\n\n= (\u22125.340 \u00b1 1.097) + (0.150 \u00b1 0.025)lUV \u2212 (0.004 \u00b1 0.015)z, \u03c3 = 0.131\n\n= (\u22127.152 \u00b1 1.229) + (0.192 \u00b1 0.028)lUV \u2212 (0.224 \u00b1 0.116) log(1 + z), \u03c3 = 0.129\n= (\u22129.273 \u00b1 1.241) + (0.233 \u00b1 0.026)lUV + (2.870 \u00b1 0.750) \u00d7 10\n= (74.61 \u00b1 25.17) \u2212 (3.349 \u00b1 1.103)lUV + (3.827 \u00b1 1.208) \u00d7\n\n= (40.97 \u00b1 27.34) \u2212 (1.949 \u00b1 1.187)lUV + (2.370 \u00b1 1.288) \u00d7\n(2.263 \u00b1 0.813) \u00d7 10\n\n\u22122\n\nt(z), \u03c3 = 0.124\n\n\u22122\n\nt(z), \u03c3 = 0.125\n\n2\n10\u22122 lUV\n2\n10\u22122 lUV\n\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n\n, \u03c3 = 0.127\n\n(17)\n\n+\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nThe results are very similar to Equations (8)\u2013(19), but the intrinsic scatter has decreased and the significance\nlevels of the regression coefficients are in general higher. Note that Equations (16) and (19) are equivalent\nto the form LX \u221d e\u2212t(z)/t0 , where the e-folding time is t0 = 5.75+4.98\n\u22121.83 (95% confidence) Gyr for Mt and\nt0 = 7.25+14.4\n(95%\nconfidence)\nGyr\nfor\nM\n.\nl+t\n\u22122.96\nThe CDF of the standardized residuals for Equation (16) is also shown in Figure 4. As can be seen, the\nresiduals no longer show any evidence for a significant divergence from normality, suggesting that we have\nminimized BAL contamination by removing the z < 1.5 censored sources. A KS test also found that the\nempirical distribution of the standardized residuals for all parameterizations considered are not significantly\ndifferent than the standard normal, having p-values of p \u223c 0.1.\n3.3.\n\n\u03b1ox Depends on Both LUV and z.\n\nIt is apparent from Equations (14)\u2013(19) that there is statistically significant evidence for a dependence\nof \u03b1ox on lUV (> 6\u03c3 significance). In addition, there is evidence from model Mt that \u03b1ox depends on cosmic\ntime (3.8\u03c3 significance), and evidence from model Ml that the \u03b1ox \u2013lUV relationship is nonlinear (3.2\u03c3\nsignificance). While the coefficients for both parameterizations imply that our data are inconsistent with\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nthe simple form \u1fb1ox = \u03b30 + \u03b3l lUV , it is unclear which parameterization is the preferred one. In particular,\nbecause there is a strong correlation between lUV and z, it is possible that the \u03b1ox \u2013t(z) relationship is simply\ncorrecting for the nonlinearity in the \u03b1ox \u2013lUV relationship, and is thus a spurious result. Because the models\nare not nested, (i.e. one is not merely a subset of the next), we cannot use classical statistical methods,\nsuch as the likelihood ratio or F -test, to compare their relative merits (e.g., Efron 1984; Freeman et al. 1999;\nProtassov et al. 2002). Instead, we adopt an approach that attempts to find the model that minimizes the\n'distance' to the true probability density that gives rise to the observed data. We do this by finding the\nmodel that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler information (KLI; see Appendix A).\nWe use the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC, Akaike 1974) to estimate the difference in KLI between\nmodels. We estimate the difference in KLI between two models by multiplying their difference in AIC by\n2\n1/2. Terms of order higher than lUV\nincreased the AIC for models Ml and Ml+t , and were not included in\nthe analysis. Denoting the maximum likelihood estimate of the model parameters as \u03b8\u0302, and the estimated\nKLI as H(\u03b8\u0302), we find H(\u03b8\u0302z ) \u2212 H(\u03b8\u0302l+t ) = 7.599, H(\u03b8\u0302\u03b6 ) \u2212 H(\u03b8\u0302l+t ) = 5.798, H(\u03b8\u0302l ) \u2212 H(\u03b8\u0302l+t ) = 2.770, and\nH(\u03b8\u0302t ) \u2212 H(\u03b8\u0302l+t ) = 0.677. Here, H(\u03b8z ) denotes the KLI for model Mz , and likewise for H(\u03b8\u03b6 ), H(\u03b8l ), H(\u03b8t ),\nand H(\u03b8l+t ). Model Ml+t is best supported by the empirical evidence.\nPlots showing the residuals and partial residuals for the Ml+t regression are shown in Figure 5. To\nvisualize the result, Figure 6 shows a 3-dimensional plot of the best fit for this model. The partial residual\nplots display the dependence of \u03b1ox on LUV , after accounting for the dependence on cosmic time, and the\ndependence of \u03b1ox on z, after accounting for the dependence on LUV . Both of these figures correspond\nto the regression results after removing the suspected BALs. Also shown in Figure 5 are non-parametric\nfits to the residuals, calculated using a locally-weighted average based on a Gaussian smoothing kernel; the\nkernel width was chosen using generalized cross-validation (e.g., see Hastie, Tibshirani, & Friedman 2001).\nAs can be seen, according to this model the nonlinearity in the \u03b1ox \u2013lUV dependence, if real, is such that \u03b1ox\nincreases (becomes more X-ray quiet) faster at higher lUV . This trend is in agreement with the results of\nSteffen et al. (2006), who found evidence that the slope of the \u03b1ox \u2013lUV correlation may be steeper at higher\nlUV .\nBased on the AIC, model Ml+t , which contains the t(z) parameterization with a quadratic lUV term,\nappears to provide the best description of our data, followed by the t(z) parameterization with only a linear\nlUV term.\n\n3.4.\n\nEffects of Sampling and Nonlinear Dependence of \u03b1ox on Luminosity\n\nTo assess how our estimate of the KLI varies under sampling from the underlying joint distribution\nof (\u03b1ox , lUV , z), we use the non-parameteric bootstrap (Efron 1979). We drew 104 bootstrap samples and\nperformed the regression for each parameterization on each bootstrap sample. We then estimated the KLI in\nthe same manner, with the exception that we now use the sample mean of the difference in log-likelihoods of\nthe original sample, evaluated at the maximum likelihood estimate of \u03b8 based on the bootstrapped samples.\nThe sampling distributions of the differences in KLI between Mz , M\u03b6 , Ml , and Mt , with respect to Ml+t ,\nare shown in Figure 7. The t(z) parameterization with quadratic lUV term, Ml+t , had the smallest estimated\nKLI for \u2248 99.9% of the bootstrap samples. Therefore, the preference for Ml+t is unlikely to have resulted\nfrom fluctuations caused by random sampling, and thus it appears that this parameterization provides the\nbest description of our data.\nIt is unlikely that the evidence for evolution is a result of nonlinearity in lUV . Assuming that there is\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nno dependence of \u03b1ox on z, we can use a suitably large enough polynomial expansion of lUV to approximate\nany smooth nonlinear dependence of \u03b1ox on lUV . However, as mentioned above, model Ml had the best\nAIC among the set of polynomial expansions in lUV , and thus our data does not prefer terms of order higher\n2\nthan lUV\n. Therefore, Ml should be viewed as the best approximation to the \u03b1ox \u2013lUV relationship that is\nsupported by our data without overfitting, and assuming that \u03b1ox is independent of z. However, because\nthe models that included t(z) had an AIC lower than Ml , and because Ml had an AIC lower than models\nthat included terms of higher order, if follows that models Ml+t and Mt are preferred by our data over\nany polynomial expansion of \u03b1ox as a function of lUV . This is not to say that models Ml+t and Mt are\npreferred over any smooth nonlinear function of lUV , but that if such a function exists, it is unlikely to differ\nsignificantly from Ml . The nonlinear effects are not extreme, and in fact are not 'statistically significant'\nin the classical sense. However, while there is not enough evidence in the data to reject a null hypothesis\nthat \u03b1ox is linear in lUV and t(z) at, say, > 2\u03c3 significance, the empirical evidence supports a nonlinear\ndependence of \u03b1ox on lUV at a given z over a linear dependence.\n\n3.5.\n\nEffect of Variability and Measurement Error on the Results\n\nMeasurement error or variability may induce false correlations between parameters. In this section,\nwe consider two effects. The first is especially important when many sources are near the flux limit of the\nsample, and when the number of sources increases strongly with decreasing flux. In the second case, a bias\ncan result even if all the sources are far above the flux limit.\nFor the first case, we argue that the expected tendancy would be for \u03b1ox to increase with increasing\nredshift, the opposite of what we claim from the data. Consider the possiblity that the sources are variable.\nAssume for simplicity of argument that the sources vary around some mean flux in all spectral bands, and\nthat a particular source spends an equal amount of time brighter than the mean and dimmer than the mean.\nThen the sources that were discovered by SDSS near the flux limit are preferentially observed in their 'bright'\nstate. By the time we observed them with Chandra, they will likely no longer be in their 'bright' state, and\nthus may be systematically X-ray quieter. Thus we expect the sources near the flux limit to appear fainter in\nX-rays on average than they really are. Since most of the sources near the flux limit are at high redshift, the\ntendency may be for \u03b1ox to increase (quasars are less X-ray bright) with redshift. Since this is the opposite\nof what we see, variability of sources near the flux limit is not producing the result.\nFor measurement error, the qualitative argument is similar. Near the flux limit, random errors in photon\ncounts result in more sources just below the limit being randomly included in the sample than sources above\nthe limit being randomly excluded, provided that the number of sources is an increasing function of decreasing\nflux limit (which is the case here). Thus, the SDSS selection would again be biased towards sources with\noptical fluxes that appear brighter in optical than they really are. Chandra then measured X-ray fluxes for\nessentially all the sources. Thus, we expect the sources near the flux limit to be systematically more X-ray\nfaint than they really are. Again, this is the opposite of what we see in the data, so this Malmquist-type\nbias is not important.\nFor the second case, measurement errors or variability may induce false correlations even if all sources\nare detected far above the flux limit. However in this case, Monte Carlo simulations can be carried out\nto see how important the effect might be. Measurement errors on the independent variables can bias the\nestimates of the regression coefficients (e.g., Akritas & Bershady 1996; Fox 1997), and errors on the dependent\nvariable can bias the coefficient estimates for censored regression. When the dependent variable is measured\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nwith error and/or variability, the measurement error and variability inflate the observed variance in the\nregression residuals, biasing the estimate of the intrinsic scatter, \u03c3 2 . For ordinary least-squares this is not a\nproblem, since the estimate for the intrinsic scatter, \u03c3 2 , and the estimates of the regression coefficients, \u03b3, are\nstatistically independent. However, for the censored regression model, the estimates of the intrinsic scatter\nand the coefficients are no longer statistically independent, and the bias in the intrinsic scatter estimate\nalso carries over to the coefficient estimates (Stapleton & Young 1984). These facts are confirmed by Monte\nCarlo simulations, which have shown that the observed relationship between lX and lUV can differ from the\nintrinsic relationship when the observed lX and lUV differ significantly from the intrinsic lX and lUV (e.g.,\nYuan et al. 1998b). Since the UV and X-ray data are measured with error, we are not fitting the intrinsic\ndistribution of lX given lUV and z, but rather the distribution of lX +\u01ebX at a given lUV +\u01ebUV and z, where \u01ebX\nand \u01ebUV are random error terms. The errors for lUV are the usual measurement errors from the continuum\nfitting and are very small in our analysis, with typical values of \u03c3UV \u2248 0.001\u20130.01 dex. However, the errors\nfor lX include the contribution from measurement errors and from variability. The errors from variability of\nthe X-ray emission arise from the fact that the X-ray and optical observations are not simultaneous. We are\ninterested in the distribution of lX at a given lUV and z; however, because the X-ray observations are not\nsimultaneous with the optical, we do not observe the value of lX given lUV for each source, but some value\nof lX which has varied from the original X-ray luminosity at the time of the optical observations.\nTypical long-term X-ray variability for Seyfert 1s is 20%\u201340% with no obvious trend with luminosity\n(Grupe et al. 2001; Uttley et al. 2002; Markowitz et al. 2003). The measurement errors in lX for our sample\nare typically \u223c 0.07 dex. Assuming X-ray variability amplitudes of 30% for the sources in our sample, this\nimplies typical uncertainties in the X-ray luminosity of \u223c 0.15 dex. Correcting the scatter in \u03b1ox for the\ncontribution from X-ray variability and measurement error, we find an implied intrinsic scatter in lX of\n\u03c3 \u2248 0.29 dex.\nTo assess whether the observed dependence of \u03b1ox on z is the result of bias arising from variability, we\nperformed Monte Carlo simulations. Because we are interested in testing if a spurious redshift dependence\nmay occur due to this type of bias, we simulate values of lX , given lUV , assuming LX \u221d L0.65\nUV . Within\nthe framework of model Mt , this form corresponds to assuming \u03b3l = 0.134 and \u03b3t = 0, and therefore \u03b1ox\ndepends only on UV luminosity for these simulations. The value of \u03b2l = 0.65 was chosen because a linear\nregression of lX on lUV found LX \u221d L0.631\u00b10.088\n, consistent with the work of Avni & Tananbaum (1986),\nUV\nWilkes et al. (1994), Vignali et al. (2003b), Strateva et al. (2005), and Steffen et al. (2006).\nThe simulations were performed as follows. We first drew 164 values of lUV and t(z) from a kernel\nestimate of their joint distribution (Silverman 1986), after removing the censored z < 1.5 sources. Then, we\ncalculated values of lX , assuming LX \u221d L0.65\nUV . The random Gaussian scatter in lX about the lUV dependence\nhad a standard deviation of \u03c3 = 0.30 dex; this value was motivated by the regression results. To simulate\nthe upper limits, we randomly censored 6 of the values of lX , and increased their censored values by a small\nrandom amount. We added random Gaussian noise to the uncensored values of lX to simulate the effects of\nvariability and measurement error, where the standard deviation of this noise was 0.15 dex. To simulate the\neffect of the measurement errors on lUV , we also added random Gaussian noise of standard deviation 0.005\ndex to the values of lUV . We then performed censored regression on the simulated values. We repeated this\nprocedure for 104 simulations, and calculated the average simulated regression coefficients for model Mt ,\n\u03b3\u0304 = (\u03b3\u0304l , \u03b3\u0304t ), and their covariance matrix, \u03a3\u03b3 .\nWe calculate the \u03c72 of our regression coefficients for Mt estimated from our sample, \u03b3\u0302 = (0.233, 0.029),\nT\nas \u03c722 = (\u03b3\u0302 \u2212 \u03b3\u0304)T \u03a3\u22121\nis the transpose of x. We found a value of \u03c722 = 11.62; under\n\u03b3 (\u03b3\u0302 \u2212 \u03b3\u0304). Here, x\nthe null hypothesis that \u03b3l = 0.134 and \u03b3t = 0, the probability of observing a \u03c722 this high or higher\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nis . 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 . Similar results were found by calculating the \u03c72 of the regression coefficients for Ml+t .\nTherefore, our observed values of \u03b3t are highly unlikely to be a spurious correlation resulting from variability\nand measurement error.\nIn summary, we argue that Malmquist-type biases from measurement error or variability will induce a\nfalse correlation of \u03b1ox with z in the opposite sense of what is observed, and therefore are not causing our\nfinding. We further showed through simulations that measurement errors or variability for objects within\nthe sample are likewise not capable of inducing a false correlation between variables.\n\n3.6.\n\nRank Correlation Analysis\n\nAn alternative test for evolution of the X-ray emission for a given UV luminosity is Kendall's generalized\npartial \u03c4 (Akritas & Siebert 1996). Kendall's partial \u03c4 has been used by Vignali et al. (2003b), Strateva et al.\n(2005), and Steffen et al. (2006), where they did not find any evidence for a partial correlation between\n\u03b1ox and z based on it, consistent with their parametric analysis. However, Kendall's partial \u03c4 has some\nundesirable properties that make it difficult to assess the statistical significance of the result (Nelson & Yang\n1988). In particular, conditional independence between variables 1 and 2, given a third variable, does not\nnecessarily correspond to a value of \u03c4 = 0. Alternatively, conditional dependence of two variables given a\nthird does not necessarily correspond to a value of \u03c4 6= 0. Within the context of this work, this implies that a\nvalue of \u03c4 = 0 does not necessarily correspond to the null hypothesis that \u03b1ox (or LX ) is independent of z at\na given LUV ; i.e., an expected value of \u03c4 = 0 does not necessarily result when p(LX |LUV , z) = p(LX |LUV ).\nIn order to test the reliability of Kendall's partial \u03c4 , we use Monte Carlo simulations to compare the\ndistributions of \u03c4 under the assumption that \u03b1ox only depends on LUV , and under the assumption that \u03b1ox\ndepends on both LUV and z. For each of the simulations, we calculated values of Kendall's partial \u03c4 for\n\u03b1ox with z, \u03c4\u03b1z,l , and LX with z, \u03c4xz,l , controlling for the correlation between LUV and z. We did this\nfor two hypotheses. The 'null' hypothesis, H0 , assumed LX \u221d L0.65\nUV , and the alternative (i.e., 'evolution')\n\u2212t(z)/5.5\nhypothesis, H1 , assumed LX \u221d L0.40\ne\n.\nThe\nsimulations\nunder\nboth hypothesis were performed in\nUV\nthe same manner as described in \u00a7 3.5. The results are shown in Figure 8.\nUnder the null hypothesis of no evolution, the expected values of \u03c4 for both LX and \u03b1ox are indeed\nnon-zero. Using the sample average of the simulations as an estimate of the expectation values, we find that\nthe expected value of \u03c4\u03b1z,l under the assumption that \u03b1ox does not depend on z is 0.105. However, under the\nassumption that \u03b1ox does depend on z, the average simulated value of \u03c4 is -0.001. Surprisingly, the expected\nvalue of \u03c4 for the \u03b1ox \u2013z partial correlation is approximately equal to zero when \u03b1ox depends on z, at least\nfor the simulation performed here. We investigate the behavior of Kendall's partial \u03c4 further in Appendix\nB.\nFor our quasar sample, we find a value of Kendall's partial \u03c4 for LX and z of \u03c4xz,l = 0.212, and for \u03b1ox\nand z of \u03c4\u03b1z,l = 0.057. Our sample has a value of Kendall's regular \u03c4 between LUV and z of \u03c4lz = 0.686.\nAs can be seen from the distributions of the simulated \u03c4 , both of our observed values of \u03c4 are about as\nequally consistent with evolution of the X-ray emission at a given LUV as with no evolution. In fact, there\nis considerable overlap between the distributions of \u03c4 under both hypotheses, thus making it difficult to\ndistinguish between the two. Unfortunately, we are not able to decide in favor of either hypothesis using\nKendall's generalized partial \u03c4 .\nBased on the simulations, the lack of evidence for a significant correlation between \u03b1ox and z based\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\non Kendall's generalized partial \u03c4 (Vignali et al. 2003b; Strateva et al. 2005; Steffen et al. 2006) may be the\nresult of an incorrect assumption about the distribution of \u03c4 under the null hypothesis. However, it should be\nnoted that the parametric tests performed by Vignali et al. (2003b), Strateva et al. (2005), and Steffen et al.\n(2006) also did not reveal any evidence for evolution of \u03b1ox . In addition, although we have shown that one\ncan both incorrectly reject and accept the null hypothesis based on the partial \u03c4 statistic, there has never\nbeen a claimed rejection of the null hypothesis of no evolution in \u03b1ox in previous studies.\n\n4.\n\nRESULTS FOR \u0393X\n\nTo investigate any dependence of the X-ray photon index, \u0393X , on UV luminosity and redshift, we\nperformed a weighted linear regression of \u0393X on lUV and log(1 + z) using all 157 detected sources. The\nweights are made up of a combination of the intrinsic scatter in \u0393X and the measurement errors on \u0393X . The\nresults are\n\u0393X = \u22123.43(\u00b13.879) + 0.125(\u00b10.087)lUV \u2212 0.678(\u00b10.347) log(1 + z).\n(20)\nBased on this regression, there is no significant evidence for a dependence of \u0393X on LUV or z, although the\nz dependence is marginally significant at \u2248 2\u03c3.\nSimilar to \u03b1ox , we experimented with parameterizing the z dependence using t(z) and z. There was no\nnoticeable difference between the different parameterizations, although the log(1 + z) model gave slightly\nbetter results in the sense of minimizing mean squared error. In addition, if any z dependence of \u0393X is due\nto a systematic hardening of the X-ray spectra at higher energies, then we might expect the z dependence\nto be best parameterized using log(1 + z).\nWe show the joint confidence regions of the lUV and log(1 + z) coefficients in Figure 10. While there is\nno significant evidence that \u0393X is related to either LUV or z, we note that the measurement errors on \u0393X\nare large and contribute signficantly to enlarging the confidence region of the regression coefficients. Because\nthe confidence region of the regression coefficients is large, the possibility that \u0393X is significantly correlated\nwith both UV luminosity and redshift is also consistent with our data.\nPrevious work by Gallagher et al. (2005) has found evidence for an anti-correlation between \u0393X and\n\u03b1UV . Motivated by their work, we also perform a linear regression of \u0393X on \u03b1UV . We only included those\nz > 0.5 sources detected by Chandra, leaving us with 136 sources. The redshift limit was imposed to ensure\nthat an adequate amount of the UV continuum was available for estimating \u03b1UV . We used the FITEXY\nprocedure (Press et al. 1992) with the Tremaine et al. (2002) modification to account for the measurement\nerrors in both \u0393X and \u03b1UV , and the intrinsic scatter about the regression. The result of the regression is:\n\u0393X = 2.21(\u00b10.07) \u2212 0.25(\u00b10.07)\u03b1uv .\n\n(21)\n\nThe \u03b1UV coefficient is significant at 3.5\u03c3. The regression results are consistent with the assumption that \u0393X\nis linearly related to \u03b1UV , and the residuals are approximately normally distributed. We also performed a\nSpearman and Kendall rank correlation test between the two spectral slopes, and found an anti-correlation\nof similar significance.\nTo test if including the UV red quasars affect our limits on the luminosity and redshift dependencies, we\nalso performed the regression after removing all sources with \u03b1UV > 1.2. Removing these UV red quasars\ndid not significantly change the confidence regions shown in Figure 10.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n5.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES OF \u03b1ox .\n\nThe parametric dependence of \u03b1ox on LUV and z has been studied previously by several authors (e.g.,\nAvni & Tananbaum 1982, 1986; Wilkes et al. 1994; Bechtold et al. 2003; Vignali et al. 2003b; Strateva et al.\n2005; Steffen et al. 2006). In this analysis, we confirm the anti-correlation between \u03b1ox and LUV seen\npreviously, but also find evidence for a correlation between \u03b1ox and redshift. Most previous studies have\nnot found any significant evidence that \u03b1ox is related to z, with the exception of Bechtold et al. (2003).\nYuan et al. (1998a) found evidence for a slight dependence of \u03b1ox with z for z < 0.5, but with opposite sign\nas that found here. Using high-quality Chandra data, we find that \u03b1ox is related to both LUV and z.\nWe perform a quantitative comparison between our results and those of Avni & Tananbaum (1986),\nWilkes et al. (1994), Strateva et al. (2005), and Steffen et al. (2006). These authors have presented their\nresults using a different parameterization for evolution, where they have fit a linear relationship of the form4\n\u03b1ox = Al (lUV \u2212 30.5 \u2212 log \u03bdUV ) + A\u03c4 (\u03c4 (z) \u2212 0.5) + A.\n\n(22)\n\nHere, \u03c4 (z) is the cosmological look-back time in units of the present age of the universe, and \u03bdUV is the\nfrequency corresponding to 2500\u00c5. We fit a relationship of this form and find Al = 0.233 \u00b1 0.026 and\nA\u03c4 = \u22120.392 \u00b1 0.103, with a correlation of Corr(Al , A\u03c4 ) = \u22120.878. In Figure 9 we show the 95% joint\nconfidence region on our estimate of (Al , A\u03c4 ), as well as the 95% confidence ellipses for AT86, W94, S05, and\nS06. These authors do not report equations for their confidence regions, so we matched them by eye. We\ncompare with the results of AT86 obtained using their entire sample, i.e., their BQS+BF+HET85 sample,\nand the results of W94 obtained using only the radio-quiet sources and assuming \u0393X = 2 as displayed in\ntheir Figure 14a. The results for the S05 sample are presented by S06.\nStatistically, our results differ from the analysis of AT86 at the \u2248 4\u03c3 level, from W94 at the \u2248 2\u03c3 level,\nfrom S05 at the \u2248 2.5\u03c3 level, and from S06 at the \u2248 3\u03c3 level. However, there are a number of systematic\ndifferences between our analysis and those of AT86, W94, S05, and S06, that, when taken into account, may\nintroduce an additional systematic component to the errors. The AT86 sample includes both radio-quiet\nand radio-loud sources, and as noted in \u00a7 2, the radio-loud sources can have an additional component in\ntheir X-ray emission from the jet. To avoid this type of contamination, we have only included RQQs in our\nsample. In addition, AT86 assumed a value of \u0393X = 1.5 when calculating the 2 keV flux. As has been found\nhere and in many other studies, a value of \u0393X \u2248 2 is more typical for RQQs. Wilkes et al. (1994) calculated\nA\u03c4 for both \u0393X = 1.5 and \u0393X = 2 and found that assuming \u0393X = 2 had the effect of shifting A\u03c4 towards\nmore negative values. If the assumption on \u0393X affects the estimated A\u03c4 for AT86 in the same way as for\nW94, then one would expect assuming \u0393X = 2 would shift the AT86 confidence ellipse toward our estimate.\nThe largest systematic difference between our work and that of AT86, W94, S05, and S06 is in the\ndiffering levels of heterogeneity of the samples and the different instruments used to collect the X-ray data.\nThe AT86 and W94 X-ray observations were done using the Einstein Observatory Imaging Proportional\nCounter (IPC). About two-thirds of the X-ray data for the S06 sample was observed using the ROSAT\nPosition Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC), with the remaining X-ray data from Chandra or XMMNewton. S06 combined sources from the SDSS, COMBO-17 survey (Wolf et al. 2004), Bright Quasar Survey\n(Schmidt & Green 1983), a heterogeneous low-z Seyfert 1 sample, and a heterogenous high-z sample similar\nto our high-z sample. The S06 sample is more heterogeneous than ours, but probes a wider range in\nluminosity; the ranges in cosmic age probed by S06 and our sample are very similar. The S05 sample is a\n4 The\n\nterm log \u03bdU V arises because we define lU V to be the logarithm of \u03bdU V LU V\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n\nsubset of the S06 sample, and does not contain the COMBO-17 and BQS sources. The main SDSS sample of\nS05 and S06 consists of 155 radio-quiet quasars that were selected from the SDSS and contained within the\ninner 19\u2032 of ROSAT PSPC pointings with exposure times > 11 ksec. Thus, the S05 sample is very similar\nto ours in its heterogeneity, with the exception of the additional low redshift Seyfert 1 sample; S05 perform\ntheir analysis both with and without the Seyfert 1 sample. The AT86 and W94 samples are both more\nheterogeneous than the S06 sample. In addition, the redshift ranges probed by the AT86 and W94 samples\nare smaller (z < 3.3) than that of the S06 sample, the S05 sample, and our sample, probing a slightly smaller\nrange in cosmic time.\nOur sample only consists of Chandra ACIS observations. Increased sensitivity gives Chandra the ability\nto detect sources with rest-frame 2\u201310 keV flux down to fHB \u223c 2\u00d710\u221215 ergs s\u22121 in a \u223c 20 ksec observation.\nIn this work, we estimate the Chandra 2 keV flux densities using data over a broader spectral range (0.3\u20137\nkeV) than that probed by the Einstein IPC (0.4\u20134 keV) and the ROSAT PSPC (0.1\u20132.5 keV). Our sample\nis also more homogeneous than those used previously, except for the S05 SDSS + high-z sample, being made\nup almost entirely of SDSS sources which had serendipitous Chandra observations; unfortunately this also\nresults in our sample probing a smaller range in luminosity. Similar to our work, the high-z samples of S06\nand S05 both consist of sources with Chandra and XMM data, and the COMBO-17 sample of S06 also\nconsists of Chandra data; both the S05 and S06 samples have slightly lower X-ray detection fractions than\nour sample.\nAvni & Tananbaum (1986) and W94 estimate the 2500\u00c5 flux density from published B- and V -band\nmagnitudes assuming a constant spectral slope of \u03b1 = 0.5. The 2500\u00c5 flux density for many of the S05\nand S06 sources were measured directly from the SDSS spectra. However, the 2500\u00c5 flux densities for the\n52 COMBO-17 sources of S06 were estimated by interpolation and extrapolation. The 2500\u00c5 flux densities\nfor the 46 BQS sources in S06 were estimated from the 3000\u00c5 flux assuming a constant spectral slope of\n\u03b1 = 0.5. The dispersion in quasar spectral slopes is large (\u2248 0.3, Richards et al. 2001), and this large\ndispersion can result in a non-negligible error on lUV if one assumes a constant spectra slope, especially\nif one is extrapolating over a large range in wavelength. These issues are exacerbated when one fits \u03b1ox\ninstead of lX , as the errors on lUV contribute to the errors on \u03b1ox , thus not only increasing the scatter about\nthe regression, but also correlating the errors on lUV and \u03b1ox . In addition, as noted in \u00a7 3.5, the X-ray\nvariability can also bias the coefficients for censored regression. In particular, these issues will affect the\nAT84 and W94 results because of the larger wavelength difference between 2500\u00c5 and the B- and V -bands\nfor many of the sources, and the lower detection fraction (\u223c 60%). The analysis of S05 and S06 is unlikely to\nbe significantly affected by these issues due to the high detection fraction and large number of sources with\ndirectly measured 2500\u00c5 flux densities. Furthermore, these authors found consistent results when analyzing\ndifferent subsamples of their data.\nStrateva et al. (2005) report values of Kendall's generalized partial \u03c4 for a partial correlation between\n\u03b1ox and z, given LUV , for their main SDSS sample combined with their high-z sample. Because the main\n+ high-z sample of S05 is very similar to ours in distribution of LUV and z and the number of sources, we\nexpect that the distribution of Kendall's partial \u03c4 under the no-evolution and evolution hypotheses should\nalso be similar. Strateva et al. (2005) find a value of \u03c4 = 0.03, where we have corrected for the sign difference\nbetween our definition of \u03b1ox and theirs. This value of \u03c4 is consistent with our value of \u03c4 = 0.057. Because\ntheir value of \u03c4 is not significantly different than \u03c4 = 0, and because their parametric analysis gave similar\nresults, S05 concluded that there is no evidence that \u03b1ox changes with redshift. However, as per the discussion\nin \u00a7 3.6, the expected value of \u03c4 under the null hypothesis of no evolution in \u03b1ox is in general not \u03c4 = 0, and\ntherefore it is inappropriate to calculate signficance levels with respect to \u03c4 = 0. Comparison with Figure 8\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\nimplies that the value of \u03c4 = 0.03 found by S05 is about as equally consistent with the evolution hypothesis\nas with the no-evolution hypothesis. However, the parametric analysis by S05 still differs from ours at the\n\u2248 2.5\u03c3 level.\nSimilar to Bechtold et al. (2003), we find that \u03b1ox is correlated with both UV luminosity and redshift.\nHowever, in contrast to Bechtold et al. (2003), we find that \u03b1ox depends more strongly on LUV than on z.\nIn addition, we find that RQQs are systematically more X-ray loud at higher redshift. Bechtold et al. (2003)\nfound that \u03b1ox is larger (more X-ray quiet) for high-z sources, but found an overall trend where \u03b1ox becomes\nmore X-ray loud as z increases. Bechtold et al. (2003) did not perform a regression or partial correlation\nanalysis, but we note that their observed marginal distribution of \u03b1ox \u2013z is such that \u03b1ox becomes more\nX-ray loud as z increases for z . 2. This is opposite the trend seen in our data, where inspection of Figure\n3 reveals that \u03b1ox is observed to become more X-ray quiet with increasing z, if one does not correct for the\nLUV \u2013z correlation.\nThe source of this discrepancy is likely the values of \u0393X used by Bechtold et al. (2003) for their ROSAT\nsources. Bechtold et al. (2003) used \u0393X values taken from Yuan et al. (1998a), which were calculated using\nthe two hardness ratios given by the Standard Analysis Software System (SASS), to estimate the flux density\nat 2 keV. These values of \u0393X steadily decrease from \u0393X \u223c 2.6 at z \u223c 0, to \u0393X \u223c 2 at z \u223c 2. However,\nvalues of \u0393X \u223c 2.6 are steeper than is commonly seen in RQQs, as has been found in this work and in\nother recent studies (e.g., Reeves & Turner 2000; Piconcelli et al. 2003). Therefore, assuming a power-law\nand the values of \u0393X obtained by Yuan et al. (1998a) may not provide an accurate estimate of the 2 keV\nflux density, and thus \u03b1ox . If \u0393X \u223c 2, then assuming values of \u0393X \u223c 2.6 will systematically under-predict\nthe 2 keV flux density for a given 0.1\u20132.4 keV flux, and consequently provide estimates of \u03b1ox that are too\nlarge. Furthermore, a steady decrease from \u0393X \u223c 2.6 at z \u223c 0 to \u0393X \u223c 2 at z \u223c 2 would produce a similar\nobserved decrease in \u03b1ox from z \u223c 0 to z \u223c 2, thus increasing the magnitude of any \u03b1ox \u2013z anti-correlation.\nConsidering that LUV also increases with increasing z due to flux limits, this would also weaken any observed\ncorrelation between \u03b1ox and lUV , and thus lead Bechtold et al. (2003) to conclude that \u03b1ox is a stronger\nfunction of redshift. This is what is observed in the Bechtold et al. (2003) data, where \u03b1ox is observed to\ndecrease from z \u223c 0 to z \u223c 2. At z \u223c 2, the Yuan et al. (1998a) sources have values of \u0393X that are more\ntypical of RQQs, \u0393X \u223c 2. In addition, after z \u223c 2, the trend in \u03b1ox is observed to change sign, increasing\nwith increasing z, consistent with the data presented here. This is also the redshift where the Bechtold et al.\n(2003) sample becomes dominated by Chandra sources, and have 2 keV flux densities calculated assuming\n\u0393X = 2.2.\n\n6.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper we were able to separate the dependence of \u03b1ox on the quasar luminosity, LUV , from\nthat of cosmic epoch, z, and we find that both dependencies are present, though with opposite sign. From\nthis, it follows that RQQs become more X-ray quiet (increasing \u03b1ox ) with increasing UV luminosity, and\nbecome more X-ray loud with increasing redshift. An analysis based on the Kullback-Leibler information\nfinds evidence that \u03b1ox may depend nonlinearly on lUV at a given t(z), with \u03b1ox increasing more rapidly as\nlUV increases.\nOne may be able to find a better parameterization for the redshift dependence than the one adopted\nhere, but that would only strengthen our claims of evidence for a dependence of \u03b1ox on z. In addition, as\nargued in \u00a7 3.4, it is unlikely that the observed redshift dependence can be explained by nonlinearity in\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n\nthe \u03b1ox \u2013lUV relationship. However, expanding the model space to include other parameters such as black\nhole mass or accretion rate may provide a better fit and be preferred over models which contain only a\nredshift and LUV dependence. For example, a dependence of \u03b1ox on black hole mass, MBH , is predicted\nby some models for accretion disk and hot corona (e.g., Janiuk & Czerny 2000; Bechtold et al. 2003). If\nsuch a correlation exists, than it may be that the the \u03b1ox \u2013t(z) relationship is simply tracing the underlying\nevolution of the active black hole mass function, which is then projected onto the \u03b1ox -t(z) plane via an\n\u03b1ox \u2013MBH relationship. In this case the statistical model that contains MBH would provide the best fit, and\nthere would be no need for an additional redshift dependence. However, in the absence of such information,\nwe find that the model that best describes our data is given in terms of a quadratic dependence on lUV and\na linear dependence on t(z).\n\n6.1.\n\nK-Corrections and the \u03b1ox \u2013z Relationship\n\nIt may be suggested that the \u03b1ox dependence on z is caused by a varying \u0393X as the observed Chandra\nspectral range shifts to harder rest-frame energies. If \u0393X were to steepen at higher energies, creating a softer\nX-ray continuum at these energies, then we would be systematically over-estimating the 2 keV flux densities,\nthus explaining the \u03b1ox \u2013z relationship. While we do not find any strong evidence for a change in \u0393X with\nz, the results from \u00a7 4 shown in Figure 10 suggest that if there is spectral curvature, then \u0393X likely flattens\nwith increasing energy. A flattening of the X-ray continua at higher energies is opposite the trend needed\nto explain the \u03b1ox \u2013z relationship, and thus our result cannot be explained by a systematic steepening of the\nintrinsic X-ray continuum at harder energies.\nBecause we do not fit an intrinsic absorber to most of our sources, it may also be suggested that the\nobserved redshift dependence of \u03b1ox is caused by redshifting of soft X-ray absorption out of the observed\nspectral region. An intrinsic absorber will more strongly absorb the softer X-rays, and therefore will more\nsignificantly affect the observed X-ray continuum of lower redshift sources. This could then cause a spurious\nanti-correlation between LX and t(z).\nTo test if the observed dependence of \u03b1ox on t(z) is the result of soft X-ray absorption shifting out of\nthe observed band, we used SHERPA's FAKEIT routine to simulate observed X-ray spectra as a function of\nz. We assumed a power-law continuum with \u0393X = 2, and an intrinsic neutral absorber with column density\nNH = 1021 cm\u22122 . We argue in the next paragraph that a column density of NH = 1021 cm\u22122 is greater than\nthe maximum NH allowed by the \u0393X \u2013z regression, and thus we use NH = 1021 as an upper limit on the effect\nof unrecognized neutral intrinsic absorption on the \u03b1ox \u2013z relationship. The observed X-ray continuum was\nsimulated for a source at z = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the intrinsic luminosity of the source was kept constant.\nWe then fit each simulated spectrum with only a power-law. This resulted in the inferred X-ray luminosity\nof z = 0 sources being a factor of \u223c 2 lower than the z = 4 sources. Therefore, based on these simulations,\nignoring intrinsic absorption can result in a spurious decline in LX from z = 4 to z = 0 by a factor of \u223c 2\nwhen NH \u223c 1021 cm\u22122 . However, the results of our \u03b1ox regression imply that the X-ray luminosity drops\nby a factor of \u223c 8 from z = 4 to z = 0, and therefore the observed \u03b1ox \u2013z relationship cannot be explained\nas a spurious correlation resulting from unidentified intrinsic neutral absorption.\nWe can use our simulated spectra to constrain a typical value of NH for our sources, assuming that NH\nremains roughly constant with redshift. The observed photon index of the simulated spectra dropped from\n\u0393X = 2 at z = 4 to \u0393X \u2248 1.4 at z = 0. From Figure 10, we note that the 3\u03c3 limit on the maximal drop in\nobserved \u0393X between z = 4 and z = 0 is \u2206\u0393X \u2248 0.35. This is considerable less than the observed drop in\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\u0393X from the simulations, and thus represents more than the maximal amount of change in \u0393X with redshift\nthat is allowed by our data. Therefore, assuming only neutral absorption, values of NH & 1021 cm\u22122 would\nproduce observed values of \u0393X at z = 0 that are too flat, and thus NH . 1021 cm\u22122 for most of our sources.\nBecause the redshift dependence of \u03b1ox cannot be explained by a systematic steepening of \u0393X at higher\nenergies, or by an unidentified intrinsic neutral absorber shifting out of the observed Chandra bandpass,\nwe conclude that the \u03b1ox \u2013z relationship is likely the result of evolution of the accretion mechanism and\nenvironment. However, more complex absorption models, such as an ionized or partial covering absorber\ncannot be ruled out as causing the observed \u03b1ox \u2013z dependence, but investigation of such models is beyond\nthe scope of this work.\n\n6.2.\n\n\u0393X Relationships\n\nWe do not find significant evidence for a correlation between the radio-quiet quasar X-ray spectral\nphoton index, \u0393X , and UV luminosity or redshift. This is consistent with results obtained using XMM\nobservations of SDSS RQQs (Risaliti & Elvis 2005), ASCA observations of RQQs (Reeves & Turner 2000),\nand fitting of composite spectra of z > 4 RQQs (e.g., Vignali et al. 2003c, 2005; Shemmer et al. 2006).\nHowever, this is in contrast with the work of Dai et al. (2004) and Bechtold et al. (2003). Dai et al. (2004),\nfound evidence for a correlation between \u0393X and LX using a small sample of gravitationally-lensed RQQs.\nBechtold et al. (2003) used Kendall's generalized \u03c4 to assess the 2-dimensional correlations between \u0393X and\nboth luminosity and z, and found evidence that \u0393X is correlated with luminosity and anti-correlated with\nz. In this work we have used linear regression to control for the artifical correlation between luminosity and\nredshift, and find that there is no significant evidence that \u0393X varies with lUV and z. However, inspection\nof Figure 10 reveals that if \u0393X does depend on lUV and z, then the directions of these trends are likely in\nagreement with the correlations seen by Bechtold et al. (2003). In addition, a systematic flattening of \u0393X\nwith increasing z has also been seen in XMM data by Page et al. (2003), and Vignali et al. (1999) found\nsome evidence that \u0393X is flatter on average for z \u223c 2 RQQs than for lower z RQQs..\nIt is interesting to note that at z \u223c 2 the observed ROSAT band has shifted to \u223c 0.3\u20137.2 keV in the\nquasar rest-frame, overlapping with our rest-frame Chandra band at z \u223c 0. Considering that the z \u223c 2\nROSAT sources of Yuan et al. (1998a) have values of \u0393X similar to those observed here with Chandra at\nz \u223c 0, and noting that the source rest-frame energies are approximately the same in these two observed\nspectra regions, this implies that the soft X-ray spectra of RQQs may be more complex than a simple\npower-law. In particular, the Yuan et al. (1998a) sources may exhibit a soft excess at . 0.3 keV, causing\nsteeper hardness ratios. Soft excesses have been seen in good-quality spectra of other low-z RQQs (e.g.,\nGierli\u0144ski & Done 2004), but the origin of this component is still unclear. If such additional complexity\nexists, it may be the cause of the steeper values of \u0393X seen in the low-z Yuan et al. (1998a) ROSAT sources,\nand thus the strong anti-correlation between \u0393X and z, and consequently \u03b1ox and z, seen by Bechtold et al.\n(2003).\nAlthough, there is no significant evidence for a \u0393X \u2013z relationship, there is marginally significant evidence\n(2\u03c3) that \u0393X flattens as z increases. While this may be caused by evolution in \u0393X , it may also represent\na systematic flattening of the X-ray continuum at harder energies or the result of a Compton reflection\ncomponent redshifting into the observed 0.3\u20137 keV band at higher z. Similarly, a soft excess redshifting out\nof the observed band may also contribute.\nAn observed anti-correlation between \u0393X and \u03b1UV may result from not fitting an intrinsic absorber to\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\nmost of the X-ray spectra. The sources with redder \u03b1UV may have higher NH , which would result in a lower\nvalue of \u0393X inferred from the power-law spectral fit. To test this, we estimated the increase in NH between\n\u03b1UV \u223c 0.1 and \u03b1UV \u223c 1.2 needed to produce the observed decrease in \u0393X . We used Sherpa's FAKEIT\ncommand to simulate spectra assuming a value of \u0393X = 2.2 and negligible intrinsic neutral absorption,\nNH = 1020 cm\u22122 . A value of \u0393X \u223c 2.2 is typical for the bluer sources, \u03b1UV \u223c 0.1. Based on the simulations,\nNH must increase to \u223c 1021 cm\u22122 at \u03b1UV \u223c 1.2 to produce an observed decrease of \u0393X from \u0393X \u223c 2.2 to\n\u0393X \u223c 1.8. We fit an absorbed power-law for the ten reddest sources with > 50 counts, and found that these\nsources typically had 3\u03c3 upper limits of NH . 5 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 . Values of NH \u223c 1021 cm\u22122 are well within\nthe limits on NH at \u03b1UV \u223c 1.2, and therefore we cannot rule out the observed \u0393X \u2013\u03b1UV anti-correlation as\nresulting from unidentified intrinsic absorption.\n\n6.3.\n\nExpectation of Accretion Models\n\nSobolewska et al. (2004a) and Sobolewska et al. (2004b) explored the general parameter space available\nfor accreting compact sources, and quasars in particular, in respect to geometry of the disk and X-ray\nemitting region. They show that \u03b1ox is most sensitive to (1) the amount of energy dissipated in the corona\nor (2) the size of the inner flow or a structure and outflow velocity of the coronal flares. Sobolewska et al.\n(2004b) suggest that the \u03b1ox \u2013LUV anti-correlation can be explained by differences in the structure of the\nX-ray emitting region. They point out that in the framework of the truncated disk and hot inner flow\ngeometry, LUV increases when the disk extends further towards the last stable orbit, while \u0393X steepens,\nreducing the 2 keV emission. In the patchy corona geometry, the \u03b1ox \u2013LUV relationship can be explained by\nchanges in the fraction of gravitational energy dissipated in the corona, where a lower fraction results in a\nweaker and softer (higher \u0393X ) X-ray continuum.\nThe redshift dependence may similarly be explained as resulting from evolution in the accretion geometry. This would imply that for a given LUV , the high redshift sources have larger radii of the inner hot\nflow sphere or they generate more flares with higher outflow velocities. Both of these explanations imply\nthat \u0393X is also correlated with UV luminosity and anti-correlated with redshift, where \u0393X steepens with\nincreasing LUV and flattens with increasing z. We find no statistically significant evidence for a correlation\nbetween \u0393X and LUV , and only marginally significant evidence for an anti-correlation between \u0393X and z.\nHowever, it should be noted that there is considerable uncertainty in the regression coefficients, and their\njoint confidence region is large. While values of zero for the regression coefficients cannot be ruled out, it is\ninteresting to note that the trends of \u0393X with LUV and z implied by the regression are consistent with the\nmodel predictions. So long as the accretion disk models do not predict too strong of a relationship between\n\u0393X and LUV , they may still be consistent with our results.\nA dual dependency of \u03b1ox on both LUV and z must relate, in current scenarios, to variations in MBH , \u1e41,\nand chemical abundances, and their effects on the accretion disk and corona. Unfortunately, the models\ndo not yet predict a specific relationship between \u03b1ox and the model parameters, and thus quantitative\ncomparison of our results with the models is difficult; this will be the subject of future research. In addition,\nthe discussion in this section has been model-dependent, and hopefully magneto-hydrodynamic simulations\nwill provide further insight (e.g., De Villiers et al. 2003; Krolik et al. 2005).\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n6.4.\n\nImproving the \u03b1ox Analysis\n\nThe main source of statistical uncertainty in \u03b3l and \u03b3t is the strong degree of correlation between lUV\nand t(z). For ordinary least-squares\nregression, the standard errors in the regression coefficients are inflated\n\u221a\nupwards by a factor of 1/ 1 \u2212 r2 , where r is the correlation between lUV and t(z) (Fox 1997). For our\nsample, r = \u22120.878, and therefore the standard errors on the regression coefficients are a factor of \u2248 2\nhigher than if lUV and t(z) were uncorrelated. Because the anti-correlation between lUV and t(z) is so\nstrong, even a small reduction in this correlation can give a large reduction in the standard errors of \u03b3l and\n\u03b3t . For example, selecting a sample to have r = \u22120.7 will result in a reduction in the standard deviations of\n\u03b3 by about 30%. Future \u03b1ox studies should try to select samples that minimize r, as has been done by S06.\nThis, along with the larger sample size and range in luminosity probed by S06, is likely the reason why their\nconfidence regions are smaller (cf., Fig. 9).\n\u221a\nUsing the fact that the coefficient uncertainties are proportional to 1/ 1 \u2212 r2 , we investigated whether\ntargeting more faint z \u223c 4 RQQs with Chandra will significantly reduce the standard errors in the regression\ncoefficients. Unfortunately, targeting a reasonable number of additional faint z \u223c 4 RQQs will not significantly improve the estimates of \u03b3l and \u03b3t . Targeting 10 additional RQQs uniformly distribution between\n45.5 < log \u03bdL\u03bd (2500\u00c5) < 46.5 and 3.7 < z < 5 will only result in a reduction in the standard errors of \u223c 8%.\nIncluding 30 additional faint, high-z RQQs reduces the standard errors by \u223c 18%, but about half of this\nreduction is the result of the increased sample size.\n\n7.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\u2022 There is a significant relationship between \u03b1ox , LUV , and t(z), and we did not find any evidence that\n\u03b1ox depends on the UV spectral slope. If we remove the 10 suspected BALs (z < 1.5 non-detections),\nthe two best \u03b1ox regressions are\n\u1fb1ox\n\u1fb1ox\n\n= (\u22129.273 \u00b1 1.241) + (0.233 \u00b1 0.026)lUV + (2.870 \u00b1 0.750) \u00d7 10\u22122 t(z), \u03c3 = 0.125\n2\n= (40.97 \u00b1 27.34) \u2212 (1.949 \u00b1 1.187)lUV + (2.370 \u00b1 1.288) \u00d7 10\u22122 lUV\n+\n\n(2.263 \u00b1 0.813) \u00d7 10\n\n\u22122\n\n(23)\n\nt(z), \u03c3 = 0.124\n\nHere, the notation \u1fb1ox denotes the average \u03b1ox at a given lUV and t(z), and the intrinsic scatter in\n2\n\u03b1ox at a given lUV and t(z) has a dispersion of \u03c3 \u2248 0.125 about \u1fb1ox . Although the lUV\nterm is not\n'statistically significant' in the classical sense, an analysis based on the Kullback-Leibler information\nfound that this model is best supported by the evidence in our data. The KLI analysis found that\nboth models are preferred over a purely quadratic dependence of \u03b1ox on lUV , and over models that\nparameterized the redshift dependence as linear in z or log(1 + z).\n\u2022 We used Monte Carlo simulations to show that the \u03b1ox \u2013z relationship is not a spurious result caused\nby variability and measurement error. Based on the simulations, we calculate the \u03c722 of our regression\ncoefficients for model Mt and find that the probability of observing a \u03c722 this high or higher is . 3\u00d710\u22123,\nunder the assumption of no evolution in \u03b1ox .\n\u2022 We used Monte Carlo simulations to show that interpretation of Kendall's generalized partial \u03c4 is\nproblematic. In particular, Kendall's partial \u03c4 for the \u03b1ox \u2013z correlation is not necessarily expected\nto be zero when \u03b1ox is unrelated to z, given LUV . Moreover, Kendall's partial \u03c4 is not necessarily\nexpected to be non-zero when \u03b1ox is correlated with z, given LUV . This can have a significant effect\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n\non the power of Kendall's partial \u03c4 , and therefore care must be taken when using \u03c4 to investigate\nwhether \u03b1ox evolves or not. Based on our simulations, we are not able to decide for either evolution\nor no evolution in \u03b1ox using \u03c4 .\n\u2022 The \u03b1ox \u2013z correlation cannot be explained as a result of a systematic steepening of the X-ray continuum\nat higher energies, as this is inconsistent with the regression of \u0393X on z. Furthermore, the \u03b1ox \u2013z\nrelationship is not the result of soft X-ray neutral absorption shifting out of the observed band. The\nobserved factor of \u223c 8 drop in LX from z = 4 to z = 0 is higher than the factor of \u223c 2 drop in LX\nthat would result for an unidentified intrinsic neutral absorber with NH \u223c 1021 cm\u22122 . Higher values\nof NH are inconsistent with the \u0393X \u2013z results.\n\u2022 We do not find any evidence for a dependence of \u0393X on UV luminosity, and only marginally significant\nevidence (2\u03c3) for a dependence of \u0393X on redshift. The \u0393X \u2013z relationship may be caused by a systematic\nflattening of the X-ray continuum at higher energies, by redshifting of a Compton reflection component\ninto the observed 0.3\u20137 keV band, and/or by redshifting of a soft excess out of the observable band.\n\u2022 We find evidence for an anti-correlation (3.5\u03c3) between \u0393X and the UV spectral slope, where the Xray continuum hardens as the UV continuum softens. This may be the result of unidentified intrinsic\nabsorption, with the UV redder sources having higher intrinsic NH , thus causing a flatter inferred\nX-ray continuum.\n\nThis research was supported by Chandra Observatory Guest Observer award GO4-5112X, and in part\nby NASA contract NAS8-39073 (AS, TLA).

The KLI may be thought of as representing the information lost\nwhen a parametric model is used to approximate the true distribution that gave rise to the (Anderson et al.\n2000). This approach is appealing because it attempts to find the model that is 'closest' to the true distribution. This approach differs from the classical method of statistical hypothesis testing, in that the KLI\nlooks for the model that best describes the data, without assuming that the true model is among the set of\nmodels considered. Furtermore, the KLI allows for the comparison of both nested and nonnested models.\nThis is important, because the parametric models considered in Equations (3)\u2013(7) are idealizations that are\nunlikely to be completely true, and do not form a set of nested parametric forms. However, among these\nidealizations, we can attempt to find the model that best describes the observed data, while fully admitting\nthat such a model is unlikely to be true exactly. In contrast, the classical approach assumes that some null\nhypothesis is correct, and then tests whether the model parameters are compatible with this null hypothesis\nat some set significance level. The significance level is usually set such that, if the null hypothesis is true,\nthen one would incorrectly reject it with low probability. In other words, the classical approach assumes that\na 'null' model is correct, and then looks for overwhelming evidence to the contrary. However, a comparison\nof models based on the KLI does not make any a priori assumptions about which model is correct, but\nrather assesses which (flawed) model best describes the observed data; i.e., is 'closest' to the true probability\ndensity that generated the data. In this sense, the KLI evaluates the evidence for the models considered,\nwhereas the classical approach only evaluates the evidence against some assumed null model. In addition,\ncomparing models based on the KLI has the advantage that all models may be compared simultaneously,\nwhereas the classical approach can only compare two models at a time.\nProblems with the classical approach to statistical hypothesis testing and model selection have been\nknown for some time, and many authors have proposed using the KLI as an alternative (e.g., Akaike 1974).\nThere is a large literature on these issues; see Anderson et al. (2000) and references therein for a more\nthorough discussion of the problems with classical hypothesis testing and the advantages of the informationtheoretic approach.\nThe KLI measures the discrepancy between the model distribution for the data, p(y|\u03b8), parameterized\nby \u03b8, and the true distribution of the data f (y); note that p(y|\u03b8) is the likelihood function for y. The KLI\nmay be thought of as the relative entropy of a statistical model, and is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nf (y)\nf (y)dy.\n(A1)\nH(\u03b8) = log\np(y|\u03b8)\nThe difference in KLI between two statistical models, pj (y|\u03b8j ) and pk (y|\u03b8k ), is then\nZ\nH(\u03b8j ) \u2212 H(\u03b8k ) = [log pk (y|\u03b8k ) \u2212 log pj (y|\u03b8j )]f (y)dy.\n\n(A2)\n\nAs is apparent from Equation (A2), the difference in KLI between two statistical models is the expectation\nof the difference in their log-likelihoods, multiplied by -1. The Kullback-Leibler information describes the\ninformation lost when a statistical model, p(y|\u03b8), is used to approximate the true distribution, f (y).\nFor this work y = \u03b1ox , and the true sampling distribution of \u03b1ox is denoted as f (\u03b1ox |lUV , z). The\ndistribution is made conditional on (lUV , z) because we are interested in how \u03b1ox is distributed at a given\nlUV and z.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\nIn order to choose the model that minimizes the KLI, it is necessary to find the values of the model\nparameters, \u03b8, that minimize Equation (A1). Unfortunately, this requires knowledge of the unknown sampling density, f (\u03b1ox |lUV , z). However, the maximum likelihood estimate of \u03b8, \u03b8\u0302, provides a good estimate\nof the \u03b8 that minimizes the KLI, and in fact converges to it as the sample size becomes large (e.g., Shibata\n1997). Furthermore, for non-censored Gaussian data, \u03b8\u0302 corresponds to the \u03b8 that minimizes the squared\nerror between the data and the model predictions, and thus finding the model that minimizes the KLI is\nasymptotically equivalent to finding the model that minimizes the expected squared error. In this work\nthe amount of censoring is small, and the censored data only contribute to the log-likelihood at the \u2248 5%\nlevel. Because the residuals from the \u03b1ox regressions are approximately Gaussian, and because the amount\nof censoring is small, we expect our statistical models to behave similarly to the usual uncensored case for\nGaussian data. Therefore, finding the parameterization that minimizes the KLI has the straight-forward\ninterpretation of finding the parameterization that approximately minimizes the expected squared error.\nBecause the difference in KLI between two models is the expected difference in their log-likelihoods,\none can estimate H(\u03b8\u0302j ) \u2212 H(\u03b8\u0302k ) for a single data point using the sample mean of the difference in loglikelihoods, evaluated at the maximum likelihood estimates of \u03b8. However, this produces a biased estimate\nof H(\u03b8j ) \u2212 H(\u03b8k ), as we use the same data to fit the model as to estimate its KLI. Akaike (1974) showed that\nthis bias is on the order of the number of free parameters in the statistical model. This led him to define\nthe Akaike Information Criterion (AIC):\nAIC = \u22122 log p(y|\u03b8\u0302) + 2d.\n\n(A3)\n\nHere, log p(y|\u03b8\u0302) is the log-likelihood of the data evaluated at the maximum-likelihood estimate of \u03b8, and d\nis the number of free parameters in the model. The differences in AIC between models may then be used\nas estimates of the differences in KLI between the models. The model with the best estimated KLI is the\nmodel that minimizes the AIC.\n\nB.\n\nKendall's Partial \u03c4\n\nTo further assess the behavior of Kendall's partial \u03c4 we performed additional simulations, varying the\ndegree of correlation between LUV and z. We drew 165 values of lUV and log z from a multivariate normal\ndensity for 1000 simulations, with correlations between lUV and log z of \u03c1 = 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9. The\nremainder of the simulations were performed in an identical manner to those described in \u00a7 3.5 and \u00a7 3.6,\nwith the exception that we did not include the effects of variability and measurement error. For each of these\ncases, we calculated the average values of \u03c4xz,l and \u03c4\u03b1z,l under both the null and alternative hypotheses.\nFrom the notation of \u00a7 3.6, \u03c4xz,l denotes the value of Kendall's partial \u03c4 between LX and z, controlling for\nLUV , and \u03c4\u03b1z,l denotes the value of Kendall's partial \u03c4 between \u03b1ox and z, controlling for LUV .\nIn addition, we also calculate the power of the test when using either \u03c4xz,l and \u03c4\u03b1z,l under both hypotheses; the power of a statistical test is the probability of choosing for the alternative hypothesis. We have chosen\na significance level of 0.05, meaning that we reject the null hypothesis, H0 , when |\u03c4 \u2212 E(\u03c4 |H0 )|/\u03c3\u03c4 > 1.96,\nwhere \u03c3\u03c4 is the standard deviation in \u03c4 . Here, the notation E(x|H) denotes the conditional expectation\nvalue of x, given hypothesis H. Using this significance level, we would expect to incorrectly reject the null\nhypothesis \u2248 5% of the time. To illustrate the effect of incorrectly assuming that E(\u03c4 |H0 ) = 0, we calculate\nthe power assuming E(\u03c4 |H0 ) = 0. Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected when the observed value of \u03c4\nfalls within the region, |\u03c4 | > 1.96\u03c3\u03c4 .\nThe results of our simulations are shown in Table 5. As can be seen, incorrectly assuming E(\u03c4 |H0 ) = 0\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n\nhas a significant effect on the conclusions drawn from Kendall's generalized partial \u03c4 . This is particularly\nnotable when the correlation between the two 'independent' variables is high, in this case between LUV and\nz. For high correlations between LUV and z, one incorrectly rejects the null hypothesis with probability\np \u2248 0.988 when using \u03c4xz,l , and p \u2248 0.845 when using \u03c4\u03b1z,l . Furthermore, when LUV and z are highly\ncorrelated and one is using \u03c4\u03b1z,l , one rarely (p \u2248 0.061) rejects the null hypothesis if the alternative hypothesis\nis true. However, one does reject the null hypothesis when the alternative is true with near certainty when\nusing \u03c4xz,l . These problems are ameliorated when the degree of correlation between the independent variables\nis reduced; however, even when \u03c1 = 0.3 one still incorrectly rejects the null hypothesis with probability a\nfactor of \u223c 2\u20134 times higher than the expected 5%.\nWe also performed our simulations experimenting with different sample sizes. We did not notice any\ndependence of E(\u03c4 |H0 ) on the sample size. This results in the seemingly paradoxical behavior that, as the\nsample size increases, the null hypothesis is rejected with increasing probability even if it is true, if one\nassumes E(\u03c4 |H0 ) = 0. While the expected value of \u03c4 under the null hypothesis does not appear to depend\non sample size, the variance in \u03c4 , \u03c3\u03c42 , does, decreasing as the sample size increases. Thus, as the sample\nsize increases, \u03c3\u03c4 decreases, and the observed values of \u03c4 become more concentrated around E(\u03c4 |H0 ). As a\nresult, if one incorrectly assumes E(\u03c4 |H0 ) = 0, it becomes more likely that \u03c4 falls inside of the region where\n|\u03c4 | > 1.96\u03c3\u03c4 , and thus one is more likely to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis as the sample size increases.\nSimilar results using Monte Carlo Simulations were found by Steffen et al. (2006). S06 concluded that\ntheir results implied that spurious but false correlations between LX and z result when there is a high degree\nof correlation between LUV and z. However, the results do not imply that spurious but false correlation\narise when there is a high degree of correlation between LUV and z, but rather the simulations show that the\nexpected value of \u03c4 under the null hypothesis varies as the degree of correlation between LUV and z varies.\nThis may then result in apparently significant correlations because one is incorrectly assuming E(\u03c4 |H0 ) = 0.\nThis incorrect assumption can also result in apparently insignificant correlations, even if such correlations\nare significant. Our simulations clearly show this, since they were constructed to ensure that under the null\nhypothesis \u03b1ox is independent of z, given LUV ,, independent of the distribution of LUV and z.\nAkritas & Siebert (1996) also performed simulations to assess the behavior of Kendall's partial \u03c4 . They\ninvestigated the power of the test and found that the test becomes more powerful as the departure from\nthe null hypothesis increases. They also found that when the null hypothesis is true, and when the two\nindependent variable are statistically independent, the probability of rejecting H0 is equal to the chosen\nsignificance level. Similar to us, they also use a significance level of 0.05 (1.96\u03c3). However, when investigating the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis, they only used simulations where the\ntwo independent variables (LUV and z in this work) are statistically independent. We have confirmed this\nresult here, but have also expanded upon it, showing that the null hypothesis can be incorrectly rejected\nwith high probability when the two independent variables have a moderate to high correlation. Furthermore,\nAkritas & Siebert (1996) concluded that the Kendall's partial \u03c4 test can become more powerful when the\nalternative hypothesis is far from the null hypothesis, rejecting the null hypothesis with high probability.\nHowever, we have shown here that this is not always true, and that the power of the test depends on the\ndegree of correlation between the two independent variables. Indeed, when LUV and z are highly correlated,\nand when one is investigating the partial correlation between \u03b1ox and z, one almost always incorrectly claims\nthat the data are consistent with a null hypothesis of no evolution in \u03b1ox .\nIt should be noted that these results only apply to Kendall's partial \u03c4 , and not to the usual Kendall's \u03c4 .\nBoth Kendall's \u03c4 and the partial linear correlation have values of zero under the null hypothesis of statistical\nindependence between the variables of interest (Nelson & Yang 1988).\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n\nOur simulations show that the expected value of Kendall's partial \u03c4 under the null hypothesis depends\non the distributional properties of the sample, and that this can significantly effect the power of the test.\nUnfortunately, we know of no way in which to analytically calculate the expected value of \u03c4 under the null\nhypothesis, and it must likely be calculated using simulation. However, one must likely employ parametric\nmethods in order to simulate data, and this undermines the nonparametric nature of Kendall's partial \u03c4 .\nWe also note that these results are not meant to be a complete dismissal of the use of Kendall's generalized\npartial \u03c4 , but rather to point out the problems that can arise when using Kendall's partial \u03c4 . If one does\nnot know E(\u03c4 |H0 ), then one is not able to calibrate the partial \u03c4 statistic against a physically meaningful\nnull hypothesis, therefore making statistical hypothesis testing based on it suspect.\n\nREFERENCES\nAitken, M. 1981, Technometrics, 23, 161\nAkaike, H. 1974, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 19, 716\nAkritas, M.

Also, note that \u03c4 6= 0 under the null hypothesis of no evolution (i.e.,\nstatistical independence of \u03b1ox and z given LUV ), and therefore it is incorrect to calculate significance levels\nwith respect to \u03c4 = 0.\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\n\n0.4\n\nThis Study\nSteffen et al.(2006)\nStrateva et al.(2005)\nWilkes et al.(1994)\nAT86\n\nAl\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\u22120.8\n\n\u22120.6\n\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.2\nA\u03c4\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nFig. 9.- Comparison of our values of Al and A\u03c4 with AT86 (blue, dashed-dotted contour), W94 (red, dashed\ncontour), S05 (magenta, dash-dot-dot-dot contour), and S06 (green, solid thin contour).
