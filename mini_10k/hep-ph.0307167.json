Also the choice of these three flavors\nfits snugly into the standard model of particle physics, which tells that all the conventional matter is constructed\nfrom quarks and leptons. The neutrino flavors, namely, electron, muon and tau neutrinos belong to the lepton\nclass. However, the discrepancy in between various observed and expected number of neutrino flavors occur. This\nis because, they transform from one type of flavor to another. Therefore, if a detector is built and set to detect for\none type of neutrinos, while that type of neutrinos are coming, some of them are converting to another type which is\nunsuited to the detector and thus results a shortfall. This anomalies have been found in the cases of solar neutrino,\natmospheric neutrino and the neutrino experiments at accelerators or reactors. Actually the neutrino flavor states\nconsist superposition of different mass eigenstates. Thus the flavor states transform from one to another as different\nmass eigenstates evolve differently. This is called neutrino oscillation. However, if CPT is violated, for a particular\nflavor the neutrino and anti-neutrino state may transform from one to other as they evolve differently. In that case,\noscillation may take place between a neutrino and an anti-neutrino for the same flavor.\nOut of several implications, study of neutrino has got great interest as neutrinos are the important ingredient of\nthe energy produced and removed from the centre of Sun. Also in supernova, neutrinos carry off the largest amount\nenergy of exploding star. Moreover, neutrinos are considered as a prime dark matter candidate. Though the mass\nof the neutrinos is very less, because of their large number, density is very great and would thus exert a very potent\ngravitational effect helping to determine the rate and pattern of galaxy formation. Therefore they may have significant\nrole in the large scale structure of the universe.\nWith all the above facts in background, naturally neutrino oscillation phenomena are of great interest for particle\nphysicists, astrophysicists, as well as cosmologist, as the number density of neutrino in universe is directly related to\n\n\u2217\n\nbm@cc.oulu.fi\n\n1\n\n\fit. Usually it is believed that the mass of a neutrino is the basic factor to attribute the oscillation. More precisely,\nit is directly related to the rest mass square difference between two neutrino mass eigenstates. However, all these\nstatements are made when the neutrinos are considered according to Galilean relativity. Gasperini [1] first pointed\nout that due to presence of gravitational field different neutrino flavors could be affected differently which violates\nequivalence principle and thus neutrino oscilations may take place even if they are massless or of degenerate mass.\nSubsequently the effect of strong gravitational field on neutrino oscillation was discussed [2]. Later on the neutrino\noscillation was studied considering the violation of equivalence principle with LSND data [3] and was shown that the\ndata can be explained by degenerate or massless neutrinos with flavor non-diagonal gravitational coupling. In a same\nline of thought, Coleman and Glashow [4] showed that in special relativistic regime, when the maximum velocity of\ndifferent neutrinos may differ each other, oscillation may happen even if they are considered massless. The goal of this\npresent letter is to study of oscillation phenomena when the space-time curvature has an important effect. Thus in\nthis case, oscillation depends on the gravitational coupling strength. In past neutrino oscillations in curved space-time\nhave been studied by various events [5]. However, in this present letter my message is something different. Recently,\nit has been shown that under gravity which brings the CPT violating interaction, neutrino and anti-neutrino split in\ntheir energy level and thus causes their asymmetry in number density [6,7]. Here I will start from that result and\napply for neutrino oscillation business. If the neutrinos and corresponding anti-neutrinos split up in energy level, that\ncreates a difference in their evolution phases, which is directly related to the transition over their mass eigenstates.\nIt was argued earlier [8,9] that in a weak gravitational field the flavor oscillation is possible with the phase strength\nof oscillation probability is proportional to the gravitomagnetic field. However, the system was chosen non-relativistic\nand the corresponding Hamiltonian was Schr\u00f6dinger-like constructed by hand. The possible violation of local Lorentz\ninvarience in Kaon sector of standard model was studied with both CPT conserving and violating cases [10]. It was\nalso pointed out that [11] in case of a CPT non-conserved situation the neutrino and anti-neutrino acquire different\nmass and thus there is a possibility of oscillation between themselves. In a same line of thought, it was shown [12]\nthat in absence of neutrino decay, in the case of CPT non-conserving situation, a neutrino evolves differently than the\nanti-neutrino of same flavor and therefore the oscillation takes place between them. In a recent work [13], it has been\nshown that a linear superposition of two opposite helicity states can be described as the eigenstates of the de Sitter\nCasimirs, which actually give rise to the majorana states. It has been argued, due to the space-time effects neutrinos\nand anti-neutrinos acquire different mass terms. In this present letter, all such scenarios have been studied in the\nmore realistic situations when the neutrinos are propagating in curved space-times. I will start with Dirac equation\nin the generalized curved space-time and all the interaction terms play in our calculation govern inherently. When\nneutrinos which are class of fermion, propagate in the strong gravitational field, e.g. close to a black hole or in the\nearly universe era when space-time is non-flat, spin of a neutrino couples with the spin-connection of space-time and\ngenerates a gravitational interaction even if there is no other interaction present. As much the curvature effect of\nspace-time is less, this gravitational interaction strength reduces too.\nFollowing [6], the Dirac Lagrangian density for a neutrino under the gravity background in locally flat coordinate\nsystem can be written as\n\u0003\n\u0002\nL = det(e)\u03c8\u0304 (i\u03b3 a \u2202a \u2212 m) + \u03b3 a \u03b3 5 Ba \u03c8 = Lf + LI ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere\n\u0001\n\u03bc\nB d = \u01ebabcd eb\u03bb \u2202a e\u03bbc + \u0393\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc e\u03b1\nc ea .\n\n(2)\n\n\u2013 = 1. Clearly LI may be a CPT and Lorentz violating interaction if the background curvature\nOur chosen unit is, c = h\ncoupling, Ba , is constant in local frame [6]. If LI changes sign under CPT transformation, it is violating CPT. More\nprecisely, under CPT transformation, if the curvature coupling, Ba , does not flip sign then LI violates CPT (as in any\ncase the associated axial-vector, \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 a \u03b3 5 \u03c8, changes sign under CPT). Therefore, it is the nature of background metric\nwhich determines whether Ba is odd under CPT or not and finally which dictates the overall nature of interaction.\nThe dispersion relation for the neutrino and anti-neutrino fields in presence of CPT violating gravitational interaction can be given as [6]\np\n|~\np|2 + 2 (B0 p0 + B1 p1 + B2 p2 + B3 p3 ) + Ba B a \u2212 m2\np\np|2 \u2212 2 (B0 p0 + B1 p1 + B2 p2 + B3 p3 ) + Ba B a \u2212 m2 .\nE\u03bd = |~\n\nE\u03bd =\n\n(3)\n\nAs E\u03bd 6= E\u03bd (due to presence of curvature which appears as gravitational four vector B) the neutrino oscillation phase\ndepends on (E\u03bd \u2212 E\u03bd ), and a non-zero oscillation probability between the neutrino and anti-neutrino comes out.\nNow following [12], let me consider two distinct orthonormal eigenstates, one is |E\u03bd > for spin up neutrino type and\nother is |E\u03bd > for spin down anti-neutrino type for same flavor. Further introduce a set of neutrino mass eigenstates\nat t = 0 as\n|A >= cos\u03b8 |E\u03bd > +sin\u03b8 |E\u03bd >,\n\n|B >= \u2212sin\u03b8 |E\u03bd > +cos\u03b8 |E\u03bd > .\n\n(4)\n\nThen the oscillation probability from a neutrino state |A > at t = 0 to an anti-neutrino state |B > for the same flavor\nat a later time t = t1 can be found as\n\u0002\n\u0003\nPab = [\u2212sin\u03b8 < E\u03bd | + cos\u03b8 < E\u03bd |] e\u2212iE\u03bd t1 cos\u03b8 |E\u03bd > +e\u2212iE\u03bd t1 sin\u03b8 |E\u03bd >\n\n2\n\n= sin2 2\u03b8 sin2 \u03b4\n\n(5)\n\nwhere,\n\u03b4=\n\n(E\u03bd \u2212 E\u03bd )t1\n.\n2\n\n(6)\n\n~ p and as the neutrinos are highly\nNow for simplicity, considering a special case of the space-time such that B0 p0 >> B.~\nrelativistic, |~\np|2 is much larger compared to the other terms in dispersion relation. Therefore, \u03b4 reduces as\n\u03b4 = B 0 t1 .\n\n(7)\n\nIt is very interesting to note that although both the neutrino and anti-neutrino are chosen of same rest mass, due\nto the presence of gravity a non-zero phase factor arises which finally produces a non-zero oscillation probability in\ntwo mass states. Therefore, I can conclude that in gravity background, e.g. in the anisotropic phase of early universe\nwhen space-time is non-flat or close to a rotating black hole, oscillations exist between the neutrino and anti-neutrino,\nwhether their rest masses are same or different. Actually, due to the effect of space-time curvature, the effective mass\n3\n\n\fof a neutrino and an anti-neutrino differs (solely due to the gravitational coupling appears as additive terms over m2\nin the dispersion relation) that finally brings a non-zero oscillation probability. Below I calculate the oscillation phase\naccording to the specific metrics.\nFirst I consider the anisotropic phase of axially symmetric early universe. Then following [14], I choose a simplified\nversion of the Bianchi II model given as\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + S(t)2 dx2 + R(t)2 [dy 2 + f (y)2 dz 2 ] \u2212 S(t)2 h(y) [2dx \u2212 h(y) dz] dz\n\n(8)\n\nwhere f (y) = y and h(y) = \u2212y 2 /2. The corresponding orthogonal set of non-vanishing component of tetrads (vierbiens) can be written as\np\ne0t = 1, e1x = f (y)R(t)S(t)/ f (y)2 R(t)2 + S(t)2 h(y)2 , e2y = R(t),\np\np\ne3z = f (y)2 R(t)2 + S(t)2 h(y)2 , e3x = \u2212S(t)2 h(y)/ f (y)2 R(t)2 + S(t)2 h(y)2 .\n\n(9)\n\nTherefore, from (2) I get\n\n4R3 S + 3y 2 R S 3 \u2212 2y S 4\n,\nB1 = 0\n8R4 + 2y 2 R2 S 2\n(4y R2 \u2212 8R S \u2212 y 3 S 2 )(R S \u2032 \u2212 R\u2032 S)\n,\nB2 =\n8R4 + 2y 2 R2 S 2\n\nB0 =\n\nB 3 = 0.\n\n(10)\n\nIf the scale factors of space-time are considered to be same in all directions, S(t) = R(t), only B 0 will remain non-zero\nand is given as\nB 0 = \u2212B0 =\n\n3y 2 \u2212 2y + 4\n.\n2y 2 + 8\n\nTherefore, from (7) neutrino oscillation phase at time t1 in early universe reduces as\n\u03b4eu = \u2212\n\n3y 2 \u2212 2y + 4\nt1 .\n2y 2 + 8\n\n(11)\n\nHere the restriction of the metric is chosen in such a manner that only when B0 is non-zero, oscillation probability is\nsignificant. That is possible only when metric deviates from spherical symmetry. However, it can be easily checked\nthat even in the case of spherically symmetric metric, say for Robertson-Walker universe, non-zero probability of\nneutrino oscillation can be achieved which may depend on B1 , B2 , B3 . Certainly, B1 , B2 , B3 have to have a significant\nvalue to visualize the non-zero oscillation phase.\nNext example can be given for a black hole space-time when the curvature effect is significant. It can be noted that\nin other context the neutrino oscillations around Kerr black holes (in case of active galactic nuclei) were studied [15]\nearlier. Here I consider the rotating black hole space-time, namely Kerr space-time, given as [16]\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\u03b1\n2\ni\nj\n2\nds = \u03b7ij dx dx \u2212\nsi vj + \u03b1 vi vj dxi dxj\n\u03c1\nwhere\n\n\u221a\n2M r\n\u03b1=\n,\n\u03c1\n\nsi =\n\na2 z 2\n,\nr2\n!\n\u221a\nry\nz r 2 + a2\nrx\n, \u221a\n,\n0, \u221a\n,\n2\n2\n2\n2\nr\nr +a\nr +a\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2212ax\nay\n,\n, 0 .\nvi = 1, 2\na + r 2 a2 + r 2\n\n(12)\n\n\u03c12 = r 2 +\n\n4\n\n(13)\n\n\fHere a and M are respectively the specific angular momentum and mass of the Kerr black hole and r is positive\ndefinite satisfying the following equation,\n\u0001\nr4 \u2212 r2 x2 + y 2 + z 2 \u2212 a2 \u2212 a2 z 2 = 0.\n\n(14)\n\nThe corresponding non-vanishing component of tetrads (vierbiens) are [16]\ne0t = 1,\n\ne1t = \u2212\n\ne1x = 1 \u2212\ne1y = \u2212\n\n\u03b1\ns1 v1 ,\n\u03c1\n\n\u03b1\ns1 v2 ,\n\u03c1\n\n\u03b1\ns1 ,\n\u03c1\n\ne2t = \u2212\n\n\u03b1\ns2 ,\n\u03c1\n\n\u03b1\ne2x = \u2212 s2 v1 ,\n\u03c1\n\u03b1\n2\ney = 1 \u2212 s2 v2 ,\n\u03c1\n\ne3t = \u2212\n\n\u03b1\ns3 ,\n\u03c1\n\n\u03b1\ns3 v1 ,\n\u03c1\n\u03b1\ne3y = \u2212 s3 v2 ,\n\u03c1\ne3x = \u2212\n\ne3z = 1 \u2212\n\n\u03b1\ns3 v3 .\n\u03c1\n\n(15)\n\nUsing (2), (12) and (15), the gravitational scalar potential can be evaluated as\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nB 0 = e1\u03bb \u22023 e\u03bb2 \u2212 \u22022 e\u03bb3 + e2\u03bb \u22021 e\u03bb3 \u2212 \u22023 e\u03bb1 + e3\u03bb \u22022 e\u03bb1 \u2212 \u22021 e\u03bb2 .\n\n(16)\n\nSimilarly, one can calculate B 1 , B 2 , B 3 . As before, if I choose a special case of rotating black hole such that B0 p0 >>\n~ p, then again the neutrino oscillation phase will depend only on B0 which can be evaluated from (16) using (12).\nB.~\nOne also can evaluate the oscillation phase for a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole. In that case B 0 will be zero\n~ p) must be removed and the\nand thus to get a significant oscillation, above restriction to the space-time (B0 p0 >> B.~\noscillation may depend upon B1 , B2 , B3 .\nFrom the above discussion, it is clear that neutrino oscillations may occur in curved back-ground. For examples\nI have chosen a space-time in early universe as well as around a black hole. It is to be noted that this oscillation\nphase is independent of the rest mass of eigenstates, and it arises solely due to the effect of space-time curvature. The\namplitude of oscillation is zero when \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0/2 and maximum for \u03b8 = \u03c0/4. Also from (5) and (7) one can evaluate\nthe oscillation length, Losc , as\nLosc \u223c t1 =\n\n\u03c0\nB0\n\n(17)\n\n(keeping in mind our chosen system of unit as c = 1 and then Losc \u223c c t1 ), when the neutrino is chosen to be moving\nin a speed close to that of light. Now if I put the dimensions appropriately, (17) reduces as\nLosc \u223c c t1 =\n\n\u2013\n\u03c0h\n.\nB0\n\n(18)\n\nIf one considers the neutrino\u2212anti-neutrino oscillation in the atmosphere of earth where the curvature effect, B0 \u223c\n10\u221240 erg, can be found on a satellite orbiting earth with velocity, v \u223c 1 km/sec [17], then the oscillation length, Losc ,\nat that space comes out to be of the order of 108 km.\nThe interesting point can be noted again that the calculated oscillation length is independent of the rest mass of\nthe individual eigenstates. Whether a mass difference exists or not oscillation exists, and in a finite interval a neutrino\ncan retain back to its initial state due to the effect of space-time curvature.\n\nAcknowledgment\nI thank D.
