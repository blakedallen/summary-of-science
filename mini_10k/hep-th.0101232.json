Possible string duals of nonconformal theories can be obtained in a supersymmetric context by considering deformations\nof conformal backgrounds [1, 2] or using fractional branes [3, 4, 5, 6]. These backgrounds\nare dual to strongly coupled gauge theories. The IR dynamics of such theories can be\ndifferent from the familiar one of their weakly coupled cousins, but they are nevertheless\nexpected to exhibit familiar phenomena as confinement, chiral symmetry breaking etc.\nThe IR region of the supergravity background, which should describe these phenomena,\nis generically plagued with naked singularities, but regular solutions are known nowadays\n[5].\nType 0 theory could provide the natural arena to extend these constructions to nonsupersymmetric theories. In [7], for example, a Type 0 regular solution was found which\nis a possible non-supersymmetric version of the one presented in [5].\nType 0 closed strings have a doubled set of RR fields compared to their type II cousins,\nhence they also possess twice as many D-branes [8]. For example, type 0B contains a\nRR 4-form gauge potential whose field strength is not restricted to be selfdual. This\nimplies that there are two types of D3-branes: those that couple electrically to this\ngauge potential, and those that couple magnetically.\nIn the closed string spectrum there is also a tachyon of m2 = \u2212 \u03b12\u2032 which is not removed\nby the non-chiral GSO projection (\u22121)F +F\u0303 = 1 responsible for the absence of spacetime\nsupersymmetry in the theory.\nDespite the presence of a tachyon in the bulk we can construct stable D-branes in\nType 0 (see for example [9] for a boundary state construction and [10] for a study of\nintersecting Type 0 branes). Here \"stable\" means that open strings starting and ending\non these branes do not contain tachyons. This means that no evident instability appears\nfor the gauge theories living on the D-brane worldvolume. In [11, 12] it was argued that\nthis may imply a nonperturbative stabilization from the string theory side.\nThe first attempts to construct Type 0 duals of large N nonsupersymmetric 4dimensional gauge theories were presented in [8]. There, a stack of N >> 1 parallel\nelectric (or magnetic) branes is considered. The worldvolume gauge theory is SU(N)\ncoupled with 6 adjoint scalars. The tachyon may be stabilized by RR flux. The conjectured dual gravity background asymptotes to AdS5 \u00d7 \u015c 5 in the UV. In this region the\ntachyon is supposed to relax towards a constant value and the dilaton runs logarithmically. This corresponds to the expected asymptotic freedom of the gauge theory. In the\n2\n\n\fIR we can have a fine tuned conformal solution [13] or a more general one [14] which\ncould correspond to a confining gauge theory.\nAn important question upon such a construction, is how can we construct the background. In fact we can consider the branes stacked parallel to each other as a stable\nconfiguration if, for example, no repulsive force is experienced by them. In [15], [16] the\nforce between electric branes was extrapolated from the gauge theory scalar potential at\n1-loop. Clearly this kind of analysis is valid only in the UV region (long distances from\nthe branes).\nIn [11] it was considered a stack of N electric and N magnetic D3-branes . For\nsuch a stack the net tachyon tadpole cancels so that there exists a classical solution\nwith T = 0. In fact, since the stack couples to the selfdual part of the 5-form field\nstrength, the type 0B 3-brane classical solution is identical to the type IIB one. This\nmay suggests that the low-energy field theory on N electric and N magnetic D3-branes\nis dual to the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 background of type 0B theory and is therefore conformal in\nthe planar limit. This theory is the SU(N) \u00d7 SU(N) gauge theory coupled to 6 adjoint\nscalars of the first SU(N), 6 adjoint scalars of the second SU(N), and fermions in the\nbifundamental representations (4 Weyl fermions in the (N, N\u0304) and 4 Weyl fermions in\nthe (N\u0304, N)). This theory is a regular Z2 orbifold projection of the N = 4 SU(2N) gauge\ntheory [11], [17]. The conjectured dual background is stable for small or intermediate\nvalues of the 't Hooft coupling, which corresponds to large curvature from the gravity\nside. The AdS/CFT correspondence applied to this particular case implies [12] that, as\n\u03bb = gY2 M N is increased, a phase transition should happen at a critical value \u03bbc rendering\nthe theory unstable. In [16] the stability of this \"selfdual\" stack was considered, again\nextracting informations from the UV gauge theory.\nIn this paper we try to extend these constructions to the general case in which N\nelectric and M magnetic branes are stacked parallel to each other. The field theory\nliving on their worldvolume has gauge group SU(N) \u00d7 SU(M) with adjoint scalars and\nbifundamental fermions in the (N\u0304, M), and in the (N, M\u0304 ). This theory is not expected\nto have asymptotic freedom.\nIn sections 2 and 3 we examine , from the AdS/CFT point of view, the IR of the\ntheory, showing that a fine tuned gravity solution exists, corresponding to an IR isolated\nconformal fixed point.\nThis opens the question upon the possibility of extending AdS/CFT techniques to\nthese particular cases. In the selfdual case in which N = M we have a line of fixed points.\nWe can apply the standard techniques to extract, for example, the conformal dimensions\nof the gauge theory operators corresponding to the gravity fields. In the general case\nwe find that a certain regular behaviour seems to be present (despite the fact that the\ndilaton blows up). This could be helpful in trying to calculate correlator functions and\n\n3\n\n\foperator dimensions also in the case of the isolated CFT. For related issues on RG flows\nin Type 0 contexts, see [18].\nIn section 4 we examine the stability of our gravity solution and of the ones presented\nin [13],[14] which cover the M = 0 case. D-branes as probes will serve this purpose. In\nthis way we will try to compute the force felt by a brane due to the interaction with\nthe others in a string context, so extending the results in [16]. We will show that, as\nexpected, Type 0 D-brane stacks are in general IR instable configurations, due to the\nrepulsive nature of the forces between branes of the same type. This fact may suggest\nthat configurations of branes more complicate than the simple stack of parallel ones could\ntake part in the game. We will also show that for a particular confining solution found\nin [14] the stack could instead be stable. Clearly, the absence of supersymmetry and the\nfact that string loop corrections could become important in the IR regime, render this\nkind of analysis speculative.\nUsing D-branes as probes will also furnish us the natural arena for discussing some\nissues related to holography and radius/energy relation in nonconformal contexts.\n\n2\n\nGravity duals of non-susy SU (N ) \u00d7 SU (M ) gauge\ntheories\n\nLet us consider the classical background produced by a stack of parallel N electric and M\nmagnetic D3-branes in Type 0B. The world-volume supports the gauge theory SU(N) \u00d7\nSU(M) with bifundamental fermions in the (N\u0304, M), (N, M\u0304 ) and adjoint scalars.\nWe use the conventions in [8] for the string frame metric ansatz:\n1\n\n\u0010\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u0011\n\nds2 = e 2 \u03c6 e 2 \u03be\u22125\u03b7 d\u03c12 + e\u2212 2 \u03be dx2|| + e 2 \u03be\u2212\u03b7 d\u03a925 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c6, \u03be and \u03b7 are functions of \u03c1 only (the same applies to T and C4 ). From this we\ncan rewrite the ten dimensional equations of motion for the metric, dilaton, RR fields,\nand tachyon so that they can be deduced from the subsequent effective action (the dots\nstands for derivatives with respect to \u03c1):\n1\n1\n1\nS =\nd\u03c1 \u03c6\u03072 + \u03be \u03072 + \u1e6a 2 \u2212 5\u03b7\u0307 2 \u2212 V (\u03c6, \u03be, \u03b7, T ) ,\n2\n2\n4\n1\n1\n\u03c6+\n\u03be\u22125\u03b7\nV (\u03c6, \u03be, \u03b7, T ) = g(T )e 2 2\n+ 20e\u22124\u03b7 \u2212 h(T )e\u22122\u03be ,\nZ\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nand the constraint:\n1 2 1  \u03072 1 2\n\u03c6\u0307 + \u03be + \u1e6a \u2212 5\u03b7\u0307 2 + V (\u03c6, \u03be, \u03b7, T ) = 0.\n2\n2\n4\nHere:\n\n1\ng(T ) = \u2212 m2 T 2 \u2212 \u03bbT 4 + O(T 6);\n4\n4\n\n(m2 =\n\n\u22122\n),\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\n\fis the tachyon potential, and\nh(T ) = Q2 f (T )\u22121 + P 2 f (T )\n\n(6)\n\nis the RR-tachyon coupling( Q \u2248 N and P \u2248 M are the electric and magnetic charges,\nrespectively).\nIn [8] was found that, near T = 0,\n1\nf (T ) = 1 + T + T 2 + O(T 3).\n2\n\n(7)\n\nRecently it was argued in [19] that in the low energy effective action of Type 0 string\ntheory no non-derivative contributions to the tachyon potential appear, leaving us with\nonly the mass term (\u03b1\u2032 = 1):\n1 2\nT .\n(8)\n2\nNow we attempt to study the possible ( asymptotic) solutions of the equations of motion\ndeduced from the action (3). We find a gravity solution which could correspond to an\nIR fixed point from the gauge theory side.\nIt is understood that in the UV, where the gravity approximation is no longer valid\n\u2032\n(\u03b1 corrections are not negligible in general), results must be taken cum grano salis.\ng(T ) =\n\n2.1\n\nIR solution\n\nThe equations of motion derived from the action (3) are:\n1\n1\n1\n\u03be \u0308 + g(T )e 2 \u03c6+ 2 \u03be\u22125\u03b7 + 2h(T )e\u22122\u03be\n2\n1\n1\n1\n\u03b7\u0308 + g(T )e 2 \u03c6+ 2 \u03be\u22125\u03b7 + 8e\u22124\u03b7\n2\n1\n1\n1\n\u03c6\u0308 + g(T )e 2 \u03c6+ 2 \u03be\u22125\u03b7\n2\n1\n1\n\u03c6+\n\u03be\u22125\u03b7\n\u2032\n\u2212 2h\u2032 (T )e\u22122\u03be\nT\u0308 + 2g (T )e 2 2\n\n= 0,\n= 0,\n= 0,\n= 0.\n\n(9)\n\nNow let us look for IR asymptotic solutions of these equations which are fine tuned so to\nhave T \u2248 0 as asymptotic solution. Note that T = 0 cannot be an exact solution like in\nthe dyonic case [11]. This is because we are considering the most general case in which\nQ 6= P . In fact we have:\n\u2032\n\nh (T ) =\n\n\"\n\nQ2\n\u2212\n+ P 2 f \u2032 (T )\nf (T )2\n#\n\n5\n\n(10)\n\n\fand, because near T \u2248 0 we have f \u2032 (T ) \u2248 1, we find\nh\u2032 (T \u2248 0) \u2248 (P 2 \u2212 Q2 ).\n\n(11)\n\nSo we find that we can have T = 0 as an exact solution of the equations of motion\nonly if Q = P which is the case considered in [11]. It corresponds to an AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\nbackground which is conjectured to be dual to a large N non-supersymmetric conformal\nfield theory with gauge group SU(N) \u00d7 SU(N).\nIn the most general case Q 6= P , we can have a zero tachyon as asymptotic solution\nin the regime in which:\ne\u22122\u03be \u2192 0,\n(12)\nwhich corresponds to taking \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e (IR limit from the gauge theory point of view).\nIn fact a consistent set of asymptotic solutions of (9) is:\nq\n\n2(Q2 + P 2 ) + log \u03c1,\n1\n\u03b7 \u2248 log 2 + log \u03c1,\n2\nq\n2\n2\n\u03c6 \u2248 \u2212 log 2(Q + P ) + 2 log(log \u03c1),\n\u03be \u2248 log\n\nT \u2248\u2212\n\n16 (Q2 \u2212 P 2 )\n.\nlog \u03c1 (Q2 + P 2 )\n\n(13)\n\nThey reduce to the first terms of the solutions found in [8], [13] in the case P = 0. When\nP = Q we find a zero tachyon which is also an exact solution [11]. Just like in [13] we\nobtain here ,in the IR, a solution which becomes AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 and in which the dilaton\nblows up (string loop corrections are not negligible). We could interpret this, as in [13],\nas an isolated CFT at infinite coupling.\nThe situation in the UV is much less under control in the sense that we need to know\nthe details of the coupling function f (T ) and of the tachyon potential g(T ).\n\n3\n\nAsymptotically AdS backgrounds and RG flows\n\nIn this section we comment about the possibility of extending the techniques developed\nin [1] and [2], to RG flows towards IR isolated fixed points. The gravity solution we\nconsider here is the general Type 0 one previously discussed.\nFirst of all we perform a change of variables in order to write the 10-dimensional metric\n(1) in the Einstein frame in the following form (we are using here the same notations as\nin [4]):\nh\n\ni\n\nds2 = e\u22125q(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 2 + e2A(\u03c4 ) dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + e3q(\u03c4 ) d\u03a95 2 .\n6\n\n(14)\n\n\fThis is realized by defining:\n\u03be 5\n\u2212 \u03b7,\n6 6\n\u03be \u03b7\n\u2212 ,\nq \u2261\n6 3\nd\u03c4\n= e4A .\nd\u03c1\n\nA \u2261\n\n(15)\n\nIn this way we can rewrite the radial effective action (3) as:\nS5 = \u2212 4\nwhere:\n\nZ\n\n4A\n\nd\u03c4 e\n\n1\n3\u0226 \u2212 Gab \u2202\u03c6a \u2202\u03c6b \u2212 V (\u03c6) ,\n2\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n2\n\n\u03c6\u03072 \u1e6a 2\n+\n,\n4\n8\nh(T ) \u221220q T 2 1 \u03c6\u22125q\n,\nV (\u03c6) = \u2212 5e\u22128q +\ne\n\u2212\ne2\n4\n8\nGab \u2202\u03c6a \u2202\u03c6b = 15q\u0307 2 +\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n(18)\n\nand\n\u03c6a = (q, \u03c6, T ).\n\n(19)\n\nAs a difference with [4] the theory is now non-supersymmetric and we are not able to\nfind any superpotential. By shifting q, \u03c4 and \u03c6 as\n\u221a \u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\n15 1\n2\n2\nq \u2192 15q \u2212\nlog(Q + P ) \u2212 log 2 ,\n4\n3\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n1\nlog(Q2 + P 2) \u2212 3 log 2 ,\n\u03c6\u2192 \u03c6+\n2\n4\n1\n\u03c4 \u2192 2(Q2 + P 2 )\u2212 3 \u03c4,\n(20)\nwe can put the potential in the form (we use the same symbols for the new variables):\n\u22128q\n\nV = \u2212 5e\n\n\u221220q\n\n+ 2e\n\nT 2 1 \u03c6\u22125q\nP 2 \u2212 Q2 1 2\n+ T + ... \u2212\ne2\n1+T 2\n.\nP + Q2 2\n8\n!\n\n(21)\n\nConsider first the dyonic case of [11]; for P = Q, T = 0, \u03c6 = const and we have the\nSU(N) \u00d7 SU(N) CFT with a line of fixed points. Expanding the action (16) near q = 0,\nwhich is a critical point for the potential, we can deduce for q the effective lagrangian:\n1\n1\nLq \u2248 \u2212 q\u0307 2 + 3 \u2212 32q 2 .\n2\n2\n\n(22)\n\nIn the normalizations where Vmin = \u22123, the relation mass/conformal dimension is:\nm2 = \u2206(\u2206 \u2212 4).\n7\n\n(23)\n\n\fFrom (22) we get m2q = 32: thus q corresponds via the AdS/CF T map (23) to the source\nfor a 4d operator of dimension \u2206 = 8, which we identify with tr(F 2 F\u0304 2 ). Analogous\nresults were found in the conifold case of [7]. As usual [12] \u03c6 is the source for F1 2 + F2 2\nwhile T is the one for F1 2 \u2212 F2 2 . For the mass squared of T we get:\n\u221a\nm2T = (16 \u2212 2 x), e\u03c6 = x\n(24)\nwhich is the result in [12], showing that the tachyon is unstable for large 'tHooft couplings.\nFor P 6= Q we have an asymptotic solution corresponding to (13): \u03c6 \u2248 2 log |\u03c4 |,\nT \u2248 \u03c4 \u22121 for \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Notice that the dilaton diverges, but T 2 exp( 12 \u03c6 \u2212 5q) \u2192 0,\nshowing that the potential is finite in the limit. Here q = 0 is still an AdS5 minimum,\nsuggesting the existence of a CFT in the IR at strong coupling.\nLittle is known about AdS/CF T in the case of isolated fixed points in four dimensions\nat strong coupling. It would be interesting to understand better the rules of AdS/CF T in\nthe case here examined. In particular it would be interesting to compute the correlation\nfunctions and the spectrum. V (q) is regular in the limit T \u2192 0, \u03c6 \u2192 \u221e, so we could\nextract mq 2 = 32. It would be interesting to compute the dimension of the operators\ncorresponding to T, \u03c6 whose fields diverge.\n\n4\n\nD3-branes as probes of Type 0 backgrounds\n\nPreviously we considered gravity solutions taking the hypothesis that they are generated\nby a stack of parallel branes. This assumption has a sense only if we can construct such\na configuration, or, in other words, if that configuration is stable. In [16] the interaction\nforce between electric (or magnetic) branes was estimated by using the gauge theory\napproximation at one loop. So those results should be taken seriously only in the UV\nregion, in which the gauge theory is weakly coupled. Here we reproduce those results\nand try to extend them to the IR region following another strategy.\nWe perform, in fact, an analysis of the backgrounds in [13], [14] which cover the\nM = 0 case, and of the general one previously discussed, using D-branes as probes.\nWe start by reviewing some general technical details and examine the relations between the UV probe calculations and the ones examined in [16]. Then we examine the\nIR region of the backgrounds cited above and show that the stacks of parallel branes\nare in general plagued by instabilities due to the repulsive nature of the force felt by the\nprobe. This suggests that the branes could be assembled in more complicate configurations (such as spherical shells) than the simplest one in which they are stacked parallel\nto each other. We will also suggest that for a particular confining solution found in [14]\nthe stack of parallel branes could be instead a stable configuration.\nFor a review of D-branes as probes of (super)gravity backgrounds see [20].\n8\n\n\f4.1\n\nGeneral considerations\n\nThe DBI and CS parts of the action for a D3-electric brane probe (in a background in\nwhich no 3-form RR or NSNS field strength is turned on) are [21]:\nSp = \u2212 \u03c4p\n\nZ\n\nq\n\nd\u03be 4 e\u2212\u03c6 K(T ) \u2212\u011c + \u03bcp\n\nwhere:\n\u011c\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\nZ\n\n\u01084 ,\n\n\u2202xM \u2202xN\ngM N ,\n\u2202\u03be \u03b1 \u2202\u03be \u03b2\n\n(25)\n\n(26)\n\nis the induced metric on the D-brane (\u03b1, \u03b2 = 0, 1, 2, 3 are the worldvolume coordinates\nwhile M, N = 0, ..., 9 are the spacetime ones). Here gM N is the string frame metric\n(1). The function K(T ) which couples the probe to the bulk tachyon has the following\nexpansion near T = 0 [21]:\nK(T ) = 1 +\n\nT\n3\n+ T 2 + O(T 3).\n4\n32\n\n(27)\n\nWe now use the static gauge: x0 = t; x1,2,3 = \u03be 1,2,3 ; xm = xm (t), m = 4, ...9, so that we\ncan rewrite (25) as:\nSp = \u2212 \u03c4p Vp\n\nZ\n\n2\ndtK(T )g00\n\ns\n\n1+\n\nZ\ngmn m n\n\u1e8b \u1e8b + \u03bcp Vp dt\u01084 ,\ng00\n\n(28)\n\nNow we can rewrite the metric (1) in the Einstein frame, in the more familiar form:\n\nwhere\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nds2 = e2A(u) dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + e2B(u) du2 + u2 d\u03a95 2 ,\n\n(29)\n\n\u2202\u03c1\n= \u2212 e2\u03b7 ,\n\u2202logu\n\n(30)\n\nand\n\u03be\nA\u2261\u2212 ,\n4\n\u03be \u03b7\nB \u2261 \u2212 \u2212 log u.\n4 2\n\n(31)\n\nFrom (28) we can thus extract the effective lagrangian:\nL = \u2212 mc\n\n2\n\ns\n\n9\n\n1\u2212\n\nv2\n\u2212 V,\nc2\n\n(32)\n\n\fwhere v is the transverse velocity and\nc \u2261 eA\u2212B ,\n\nm \u2261 \u03c4p K(T )e2(A+B) ,\n\nV \u2261 \u2212 \u03bcp \u01084 ,\n\n(33)\n\nare all functions of u.\nAs usual in D-brane probe analysis we will take the low velocity limit vc << 1. As\npointed out in [22] this requires some care being the function c not constant (this is\ntrue also in the supersymmetric BPS case). With this in mind, we find the low velocity\nlagrangian:\nL = Ek \u2212 V,\n(34)\nwhere the effective kinetic energy is:\n1\ne\u2212\u03b7\n\u03c4p K(T ) 2 v 2 .\n2\nu\n\nEk =\n\n(35)\n\nTo write explicitly the potential, let us consider for example the M = 0 case. In the\nansatz of [8], we have, for the electric RR 5-form field strength:\nF5 (\u03c1) = d[A(\u03c1)dx0 \u2227 dx1 \u2227 dx2 \u2227 dx3 ]\n\u22121\n\n\u22122\u03be \u22121\n\n\u0226(\u03c1) = \u2212gs 2Qe\n\nf\n\n(36)\n\n(T ).\n\n(37)\n\nBy using this result, we see that the potential term in (34) takes the form (\u03c4p = gs \u22121 \u03bcp ):\n\u0014\n\n\u2212\u03be\n\nV = \u03c4p K(T )e\n\n+ 2Q\n\nZ\n\n\u22122\u03be \u22121\n\nd\u03c1e\n\nf\n\n\u0015\n\n(T ) ,\n\n(38)\n\nwhich we shall rewrite as a function of u.\nLet us end this introductory section with a series of observations. In static gauge, the\nprobe effective action may be written as (let us take \u03b8\u0307i = 0):\nS \u2248 \u03c4p Vp\n\nZ\n\n\"\n\n\u2212\u03c6\n\ndt K(T )e\n\n\"\n\ne\u03c6\u2212\u03b7\n(\u2202u)2 + F 2 \u2212 V (u) ,\n2\nu\n#\n\n#\n\n(39)\n\nwhere we have inserted explicitly the U(1) field strength living on the brane.

Here we take g(T ) = 21 T 2 and suppose f(T) has a minimum for\nT = TU V . 2 So, with \u03c1 = e\u2212y , we have [14, 23]:\n\nT = TU V\n\u03be = log\n\n4\nlog2 y\n,\n+\n+ 2 (39 log y + k \u2212 20) + O\nTU V y y\ny3\n!\n\n8\n\n1\nlog2 y\n1\n,\n2f \u22121 (TU V )Q \u2212 y + + 2 (39log y + k \u2212 104) + O\ny 2y\ny3\n\nq\n\n!\n\n1\n1\n1\nlog2 y\n\u03b7 = \u2212 y + log 2 + + 2 (39 log y + k \u2212 38) + O\n,\n2\ny 2y\ny3\n!\n\nlog2 y\n1\n.\n\u03c6 = \u22122 log(C0 Q) \u2212 2 log y + 15 log 2 + (39 log y + k) + O\ny\ny3\n!\n\n(44)\n\nIn the near UV we thus have:\nlog \u03c1 + log(log \u03c1)2 \u2248 \u22124 log u,\n\nu \u2192 \u221e (\u03c1 \u2192 0).\n\n(45)\n\nThe kinetic term thus asymptotes to:\ndEk =\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n\u03c4p K(T )4 log u du2 + u2 d\u03a92 5 .\n2\n\n(46)\n\nThe behaviour of this term depends also from that of K(T ). If K(T ) is asymptotically\nconstant in the UV we get a divergent kinetic term. But what is the real behaviour\nof K(T )? At this stage of approximations nothing sensible can be said about that.\nNevertheless, if we argument, as in [8], that gravity approximation could capture some\n2\n\nFor example this could be obtained with:\nf (T ) = eT \u2212\n\nT3\n3\n\nwhich has a minimun for T = \u22121 and reproduce the near T = 0 behaviour (7).\n\n11\n\n(43)\n\n\fgauge theory physics, we can tentatively extract some informations from the gauge theory\nside. For example we know that [11] :\ngY\u22122M \u2248 logu.\n\n(47)\n\nBy using the relation in (42) and observing that e\u2212\u03c6 \u2248 (log u)2 we can tentatively predict\nK(T ) \u2248 (log u)\u22121 . 3 From this we could have a constant kinetic term for the probe.\nFor the potential term (38) in the probe effective action we have the following near\nUV behaviour:\nq\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u22121 (T\nK(T\n)\n\u2212\n2f\n)\n\u03c4p \uf8f0\nUV\n\uf8fb u4 log2 u,\nq\n(48)\nV \u2248\nQ\n2f \u22121 (TU V )\n\nwhich tends to \u00b1\u221e for u \u2192 \u221e, depending on the details of K(T ) and f (T ). From\nthese details, thus depends the nature of the force that the probe experts (if attractive\nor repulsive). By identifying V with the scalar potential term in the dual field theory as\nin (42) we can predict the following functional form for Vf (\u03a6):\nVf (\u03a6) \u2248 \u03a64 log\n\n\u03a6\n,\n\u039b\n\n(49)\n\na result which was obtained from 1-loop calculations in field theory [15].\nLet us finally observe that the slow velocity limit for the probe action, is a sensible\none in the UV because, from (44) and (33), we can deduce that c \u2192 \u221e when u \u2192 \u221e.\nThis could be responsible for the correct behaviour of the potential term for scalars fields,\ndespite the gravity approximation is not valid in the UV.\n\n4.2\n\nProbing the M = 0 IR solutions\n\nLet us now analyse the IR solutions discussed in [13] and [14] for the case M = 0. In\nthe first case we have a fixed point at infinite coupling , while in the latter we have a\nconfining solution. In the conformal case [13] the IR behaviours are (\u03c1 = ey \u2192 \u221e):\n16\n8\nlog2 y\n\u2212 2 (9 log y \u2212 3) + O( 3 ),\ny\ny\ny\n9\n9\n20\nlog2 y\n1\n2\n\u03be = log(2Q ) + y + + 2 (9 log y \u2212 ) + O( 3 ),\n2\ny 2y\n9\ny\n1\n1\nlog2 y\n1\n\u03b7 = log 2 + y + + 2 (9 log y \u2212 2) + O( 3 ),\n2\ny 2y\ny\n1\n9\nlog y\n\u03c6 = \u2212 log(2Q2 ) + 2 log y \u2212 log y + O( 2 ).\n2\ny\ny\nT = \u2212\n\n3\n\n(50)\n\nIf, for example K(T ) = sinh[a(T \u2212 TUV )], we could have this asymptotic behaviour in the UV and\na near T = 0 behaviour similar to that in (27).\n\n12\n\n\fIt the IR thus T \u2192 TIR = 0. The Einstein-frame metric asymptotes to AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 at\n\u03c1 = \u221e and evolves into a metric with negative Ricci scalar at smaller \u03c1.\nFrom the IR behaviour of \u03b7 we can deduce that:\nlog \u03c1 \u2212 log(log \u03c1)2 \u2248 \u2212 4 log u.\n\n(51)\n\nFrom this, the subsequent asymptotic behaviour for the effective kinetic term in the probe\naction, follows:\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 2\n1\n(52)\ndu + u2 d\u03a95 2 .\ndEk \u2248 \u2212 \u03c4p\n2 log u\nFrom this we see that in the IR case , the kinetic term tends to zero. This reflects the\nfact that the coupling of the gauge theory tends to infinity. The contributions to Ek\ncoming from K(T ), do not modify the asymptotic behaviour (52), but they are crucial\nin determining the sign of the kinetic term. Moving a little away from the IR extremum,\nit is possible to verify that the kinetic term does not become negative. This depends\n3\ncrucially on the coefficient 32\nwhich multiplies the T 2 term in K(T ) (27).\nNow let us examine the potential term for the probe. We get the following near IR\nbehaviour:\n!\nu4\n\u03c4p 1\n\u221a \u22121\nV \u2248\n.\n(53)\nQ\n(log u)2\n2\nSo the potential energy tends to zero from negative values. This means that probe\ncalculations give a repulsive force between the sources and the probe in the IR. We\ncan thus imagine that a distribution of branes more complicate than the simple stack\nof parallel ones is the source of our bakground. The solution we are discussing here is\nconformal in the IR, which corresponds to fine tune the gravity solution so to have that\nthe scalars remain massless. This should correspond to taking the D-branes forming an\nSO(6) shell in the transverse space. We will see however that the low velocity limit do\nnot seem to be a sensible one for this IR solution. So all these considerations must be\ntaken with caution. Let us only outline that eq. (53) could give indicative suggestions\nabout the scalar potential in the IR.\nThe IR solution proposed for the confining case [14] has instead the following behaviour:\n\u03c6 \u2248 \u03b10 \u03c1 + \u03c6 0 ,\n\n\u03be \u2248 \u03b11 \u03c1 + \u03be 0 ,\n\n\u03b7 \u2248 \u03b12 \u03c1 + \u03b70 ,\n\n\u03b1i > 0, i = 0, 1, 2\n\n(54)\n\nwith the tachyon exponentially relaxing to zero and with:\n1 2 1 2\n\u03b10 + \u03b11 \u2212 5\u03b12 = 0.\n2\n2\n13\n\n(55)\n\n\fIn [14] was showed that the particular solution with \u03b11 = \u03b12 and \u03b10 = 3\u03b11 could receive\nmild corrections from string loops, so that the corresponding gravity solution could be\nused to study the conjectured dual field theory. Wilson loop calculations showed that\nthe solution in (54) can give confinement from the gauge theory side. Here we want to\ndiscuss this background from the point of view of the probe effective action.\nLet us consider the solution with \u03b11 = \u03b12 , \u03b10 = 3\u03b11 . The relation between \u03c1 and u\nnow reads:\nlog u \u2248 e\u22122\u03b11 \u03c1 .\n(56)\nJust note that now, with \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e, u \u2192 1. This is an IR limit from the gauge theory side.\nIn fact what we call \"energy\" E in the field theory context, is a parameter which, naively,\ncan be read from the tension of a string stretched between the sources at u = 1 and a\nD3 probe at a generic u [24]. Thus if we consider a string stretched along u direction, we\nget (\u03c4 = x0 ; \u03c3 = u):\nE \u2248\n\nZ\n\ndue\n\n1\n\u03c6\n2\n\n\u221a\n\ng00 guu =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ne 2 (\u03c6\u2212\u03b7)\n.\ndu\nu\n\n(57)\n\nJust note that this is the same relation (with \u03a6 prae E) between the new variable and u\nwhich was found in writing the gauge theory lagrangian in canonical form (see eq. (41)).\nFor the solutions (54) with \u03b11 = \u03b12 , \u03b10 = 3\u03b11 , this gives:\nE\u2248\n\nq\n\nlog u.\n\n(58)\n\nSo from these naive considerations it could be argued that E \u2192 0 when u \u2192 1. The\nfact that the background has a singularity in u = 1 [14], renders impossible a stronger\nmotivation for eq. (58), which we take only as an indicative relation.4\nThe kinetic term for the probe has now the following near IR behaviour:\nq\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ndEk \u2248 \u03c4p log u du2 + u2 d\u03a95 2 .\n\n(59)\n\nWe see that this term goes to zero in the IR. For the leading terms in the potential energy\nwe find:\nq\n(60)\nV \u2248 \u03c4p log u \u2248 E.\n\nThe force the probe experts is thus attractive, with a modulus which tends to infinity\nwhen u \u2192 1. This seems to imply that for the particular solution of [14] the stack of\n4\n\nIt is quite simple to verify that for the UV and the IR conformal solutions previously discussed,\nwe (asymptotically) have u \u2248 E. The same relation can be obtained from holographic considerations,\nfollowing the prescriptions of [25] and [26] for relating energy and radius. The same prescriptions fail\nhowever in the nonconformal case just as was noted in [26].\n\n14\n\n\fparallel branes could be a stable configuration, differently from the fine tuned conformal\nones.\nIt is interesting to note that c, the \"speed of light in transverse space\", goes to zero in\nthe IR conformal case (thus requiring a little of justification in taking the slow velocity\nlimit), while for the confining solutions in (54) it has the following behaviour:\nc2 \u2248 (log u)\n\n(\u03b12 \u2212\u03b11 )\n2\u03b12\n\nu2 .\n\n(61)\n\nFor the particular solution with \u03b11 = \u03b12 we have considered here, we have c 6= 0 in the\nIR, which could make the slow velocity limit more sensible.\n\n4.3\n\nProbing the N + M IR conformal solution\n\nLet us now try to extend the previous considerations to the IR conformal solution discussed at the beginning of this work. Suppose having constructed a background generated\nby N+M sources and moving towards them a dyonic D3 probe. The effective action for\nthis probe reads:\nSp = \u22122\u03c4p\n\nZ\n\nq\n\nd4 \u03bee\u2212\u03c6 \u2212\u011c\u22122gs\u22121 \u03bcp\n\nZ\n\n\u0014\n\nd4 \u03be Q\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c1e\u22122\u03be f \u22121 (T ) + P\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\n\nd\u03c1e\u22122\u03be f (T ) . (62)\n\nWe have used here the fact that the terms proportional to T in Kel (T ) and Kmag (T ),\ncancel each other (see [11]). Moreover, as argued in [11], we have set fel\u22121 (T ) = fmag (T ).\nFrom (62) we immediately see that the kinetic term for this probe is simply two times\nthe one in (52). For the potential energy we get, using (13):\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u221a\n2\u03c4p\n(Q\n+\nP\n)\nu4\n\uf8f01 \u2212 q\n\uf8fb\nV \u2248 q\n.\n(63)\n2\n(Q2 + P 2)\n2(Q2 + P 2 ) (log u)\n\nIn the dyonic case Q = P of [11], in which the background is exactly AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 , T = 0,\nthe effective mass of a dyonic probe is constant and the potential is zero. For Q 6= P , V\nis always positive, unlike in the purely electric case. This implies that the dyonic probe\nexperts an attractive force.\nIf we consider just an electric probe we get, for the potential:\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\nu4\n\uf8f01 \u2212 q\n\uf8fb\nV \u2248 q\n.\n2\n2(Q2 + P 2 )\n2(Q2 + P 2 ) (log u)\n\u03c4p\n\n2Q\n\n(64)\n\nSo we can have V > 0 only if P > Q. For a magnetic probe the same is true if Q > P .\nThus the stack of N + M branes is unstable with respect to moving off an electric or\nmagnetic brane.\nThere exist thus instabilities in the fine tuned background we have constructed. This\nsuggests that a different assumption, instead of the naive one in which the branes are\ntaken parallel to each other, should be taken.\n15\n\n\f5\n\nDiscussion\n\nIt would be interesting to extend this kind of analysis to orbifolds and orientifolds of\nType 0 string theory. For example a modified \u03a9 projection exists, which removes the\nclosed string tachyon (and modifies the closed string spectrum which becomes chiral),\nallowing at the same time an open U(32) spectrum free of tachyons as well [27]. 5 . See\nalso [28] for brane constructions in this context.\nIt would also be interesting to make explicit the angular momentum of the probe in\nour calculations. As the probe moves on geodesics, this is a conserved quantity. Effects of\nthe angular momentum in cosmological analysis of Type 0 backgrounds were studied in\n[29]. For a study of possible singularity resolutions via angular momentum in the context\nof Type II theory, see [30].\nAcknowledgments\nA special thank to A.
