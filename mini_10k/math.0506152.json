We generalize graded Hecke algebras to include a twisting twococycle for the associated finite group. We give examples where the parameter\nspaces of the resulting twisted graded Hecke algebras are larger than that of\nthe graded Hecke algebras. We prove that twisted graded Hecke algebras are\nparticular types of deformations of a crossed product.\n\n1. Introduction\nDrinfel'd defined graded Hecke algebras for any finite subgroup G of GL(V ) [8].\nThis definition was shown by Ram and Shepler [20] to generalize the definition of\ngraded versions of affine Hecke algebras for real reflection groups given by Lusztig,\nwho was motivated by questions in representation theory [16, 17]. In the same\npaper Ram and Shepler classified all graded Hecke algebras for complex reflection\ngroups. They found many nontrivial graded Hecke algebras, but also showed that\nsome groups (such as G(r, 1, n) = Z/rZ \u2240 Sn when r > 2, n > 3) have no nontrivial graded Hecke algebras. Etingof and Ginzburg showed that in the case of\na finite symplectic group, the symplectic form itself arises naturally in the structure of any associated graded Hecke algebra, always yielding nontrivial examples,\nwhich they called symplectic reflection algebras [9]. Many authors have studied\nrepresentations of graded Hecke algebras, their subalgebras generated by certain\nidempotents, and connections to the geometry of the corresponding orbifolds V /G.\n(See for example [13, 15, 18, 19].)\nIn this note we generalize these constructions by incorporating a two-cocycle \u03b1\nthat represents an element of the cohomology group H2 (G, C\u00d7 ). Chmutova introduced such a two-cocycle for symplectic groups, showing that it appears naturally\nin symplectic reflection algebras arising from nonfaithful group representations\nto Sp(V ) [7]. Here our motivation comes from numerous papers on orbifolds in\nwhich such a cocycle, called discrete torsion, appears ([1, 6, 22] are just a few),\nas well as our finding that for some groups there is a nontrivial twisted graded\nHecke algebra even if there is no nontrivial graded Hecke algebra (such as Example 2.16 below). We adapt the direct linear-algebraic approach of Ram and\nDate: June 7, 2005.\nPartially supported by NSF grants #DMS\u20130422506, 0443476.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSARAH WITHERSPOON\n\nShepler to derive criteria for existence of such nontrivial twisted graded Hecke algebras (Theorem 2.10, Corollary 2.13). We give examples for which the parameter\nspaces for twisted graded Hecke algebras are larger than that for graded Hecke\nalgebras: Sn \u2282 GL(Cn ) via the permutation representation (Example 2.17), as\nwell as (Z/lZ)n\u22121 \u2282 SL(Cn ) (Example 2.16). On the other hand, if G is symplectic, this is not the case (Example 2.15). It would be interesting to do a more\nthorough analysis of the parameter spaces of twisted graded Hecke algebras for\nvarious types of groups.\nIn Section 3 we show that twisted graded Hecke algebras are precisely particular types of deformations of crossed product algebras S(V )#\u03b1 G (Theorem\n3.2). We use this idea to show that Ram and Shepler's isomorphism between the\ndifferent definitions of (untwisted) graded Hecke algebra given by Drinfel'd and\nLusztig arises as an equivalence of deformations whose infinitesimals are thus cohomologous. This also puts previous results into a larger context: There are in\ngeneral many more infinitesimal deformations (that is, Hochschild two-cocycles)\nof S(V )#\u03b1 G than those that lift to deformations that are (twisted) graded Hecke\nalgebras. In some cases these other infinitesimals also lift to deformations of\nS(V )#\u03b1 G: See Remark 2.14 herein and [6, 24]. We are not aware of a general\nresult regarding such deformations.\nWe thank A. Ram for several stimulating conversations. It was a question of his\nthat ultimately led to this work as well as to insight into other related projects. We\nthank R.-O. Buchweitz for explaining a computation of the relevant Hochschild\ncohomology to us.\nThroughout, we will work over the complex numbers C, so that \u2297 = \u2297C unless\notherwise indicated.\n2. Twisted graded Hecke algebras\nOur approach to graded Hecke algebras will be through crossed products (generalizations of skew group algebras), so we begin by summarizing this construction.\nOur definition below of (twisted) graded Hecke algebras involves a parameter t,\nwhich may be taken to be an indeterminate or any complex number. In Section\n3 we will assume t is an indeterminate, as we will discuss deformations over the\npolynomial ring C[t]. Specializing t to any nonzero complex number results in a\ndefinition of graded Hecke algebra equivalent to those in the literature.\nLet V = Cn , G a finite subgroup of GL(V ), and \u03b1 : G \u00d7 G \u2192 C\u00d7 a two-cocycle,\nthat is\n(2.1)\n\n\u03b1(g, h)\u03b1(gh, k) = \u03b1(h, k)\u03b1(g, hk)\n\nfor all g, h, k \u2208 G. The action of G on V induces actions by algebra automorphisms\non the tensor algebra T (V ) and the symmetric algebra S(V ).\nSuppose S is any associative C-algebra with an action of G by automorphisms,\nfor example S = T (V ) or S = S(V ). Then we may form the crossed product\n\n\fTWISTED GRADED HECKE ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\nalgebra S#\u03b1 G, which is S \u2297 CG as a vector space, and has multiplication\n(r \u2297 g)(s \u2297 h) = \u03b1(g, h)r(g * s) \u2297 gh\nfor all r, s \u2208 S and g, h \u2208 G. This makes S#\u03b1 G an associative algebra as \u03b1 is a\n\u223c\ntwo-cocycle. Note that S is a subalgebra of S#\u03b1 G, via S \u2212\u2192 S \u2297 1, and that the\nsubalgebra 1 \u2297 CG of S#\u03b1 G is also known as the twisted group algebra C\u03b1 G. We\naccordingly abbreviate s \u2297 g by sg (s \u2208 S, g \u2208 G). The action of G on S becomes\nan inner action on S#\u03b1 G, namely s 7\u2192 gs(g)\u22121 for all s \u2208 S, g \u2208 G.\nThe two-cocycle \u03b1 is a coboundary if there is some function \u03b2 : G \u2192 C\u00d7 such\nthat\n(2.2)\n\n\u03b1(g, h) = \u03b2(g)\u03b2(h)\u03b2(gh)\u22121\n\nfor all g, h \u2208 G. The set of two-cocycles modulo coboundaries forms an abelian\ngroup under pointwise multiplication, called the Schur multiplier of G, and denoted\nH2 (G, C\u00d7 ). If two cocycles differ by a coboundary, that is if they are cohomologous,\nthe corresponding crossed products are isomorphic.\nReplacing \u03b1 by a cohomologous cocycle if necessary, we may assume that \u03b1 is\nnormalized so that \u03b1(1, g) = \u03b1(g, 1) = 1 for all g \u2208 G. It follows that 1 is the\nmultiplicative identity for C\u03b1 G. Thus (g)\u22121 = \u03b1\u22121 (g, g \u22121)g \u22121 = \u03b1\u22121 (g \u22121, g)g \u22121\nfor all g \u2208 G.\nFor each g \u2208 G, choose a skew-symmetric bilinear form ag : V \u00d7 V \u2192 C\n(arbitrary for now, and possibly 0). Let t be an indeterminate and extend scalars,\nS#\u03b1 G[t] := C[t] \u2297 (S#\u03b1 G). Let A be the quotient of T (V )#\u03b1 G[t] by the (twosided) ideal I[t] generated by all\nX\n(2.3)\n[v, w] \u2212\nag (v, w)tg\ng\u2208G\n\nwhere v, w \u2208 V and [v, w] = vw \u2212 wv. (We have omitted tensor symbols in\nelements of T (V ) for brevity.) Note that A is additively isomorphic to a quotient\nof S(V )#\u03b1 G[t] via any choice of linear section S(V ) \u0592\u2192 T (V ) of the canonical\nprojection of T (V ) onto S(V ). This quotient is proper if and only if there is more\nthan one way to rearrange factors in a word by applying the relations (2.3). We say\nthat A is a twisted graded Hecke algebra if the above map yields A \u223c\n= S(V ) \u2297 CG[t]\nas vector spaces over C[t]. Equivalently, if we assign degree 1 to elements of V and\ndegree 0 to elements of G, then A is a filtered algebra over C[t] and is a twisted\ngraded Hecke algebra in case the associated graded algebra grA is isomorphic to\nS(V )#\u03b1 CG[t].\nRemark 2.4. Let \u03b1 be the trivial two-cocycle \u03b1(g, h) = 1 for all g, h \u2208 G, and\nlet t = 1. Then A becomes the graded Hecke algebra of [8, 20].\nWe will use the techniques of Ram and Shepler [20] to determine the conditions\non the bilinear forms ag under which A is a twisted graded Hecke algebra. Let\n\n\f4\n\nSARAH WITHERSPOON\n\nh \u2208 G, and use (2.3) to obtain two\ninvolving [h\u22121 * v, h\u22121 * w]. By direct\nPexpressions\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nsubstitution: [h * v, h * w] = g\u2208G ag (h * v, h\u22121 * w)tg. By conjugating (2.3)\nby (h)\u22121 :\nX\n[h\u22121 * v, h\u22121 * w] =\nag (v, w)t(h)\u22121 gh\ng\u2208G\n\n=\n\nX\n\nag (v, w)\u03b1\u22121(h, h\u22121 )\u03b1(g, h)\u03b1(h\u22121, gh)th\u22121 gh.\n\ng\u2208G\n\nBoth must be in the ideal I[t], and the assumed additive isomorphism A \u223c\n=\nS(V )\u2297CG[t] allows us to equate coefficients of each g (g \u2208 G) in these two expressions. Thus we have ah\u22121 gh (h\u22121 *v, h\u22121 *w) = \u03b1\u22121 (h, h\u22121 )\u03b1(g, h)\u03b1(h\u22121, gh)ag (v, w),\nand replacing v, w by h * v, h * w, we obtain the first equation below. Again the\nisomorphism A \u223c\n= S(V ) \u2297 CG[t] implies that in any expression wvu \u2208 V \u22973 , three\napplications of (2.3) in any order to obtain uvw plus an element in tA must yield\nthe same element of A. Comparison results in the second equation below. Thus\nnecessary conditions for A to be a twisted graded Hecke algebra are:\n(2.5)\n(2.6)\n\nah\u22121 gh (v, w) = \u03b1\u22121 (h, h\u22121 )\u03b1(g, h)\u03b1(h\u22121, gh)ag (h * v, h * w)\nag (u, v)(g * w \u2212 w) + ag (v, w)(g * u \u2212 u) + ag (w, u)(g * v \u2212 v) = 0\n\nfor all g, h \u2208 G and u, v, w \u2208 V . These equations will be used in the proofs of the\nfollowing lemma and theorem.\nNot only are (2.5) and (2.6) necessary for A to be a twisted graded Hecke algebra,\nbut they are also sufficient: The relations (2.3) allow for rearrangement of any\nexpression in A to a particular form identified with an element of S(V ) \u2297 CG[t],\nand the relations (2.5) and (2.6) imply that such a form is unique. That is, (2.5)\nis equivalent to uniqueness of the canonical form of hvu, and (2.6) is equivalent\nto uniqueness of the canonical form of wvu (u, v, w \u2208 V , h \u2208 G), as demonstrated\nin [20] for the case \u03b1 = 1 (in the text above Lemma 1.5). The uniqueness of the\nform of wvu is equivalent to the Jacobi identity in A,\n(2.7)\n\n[u, [v, w]] + [v, [w, u]] + [w, [u, v]] = 0,\n\nwhich is another way to express the condition (2.6). For the uniqueness of the\ncanonical form of a monomial having more than three factors, it is helpful to note\nthat replacing any of u, v, w in the left side of (2.7) by an element of degree larger\nthan 1 results in an element in the ideal generated by the left side of (2.7). (For\nmore details, see [20].)\nLet ( , ) be any G-invariant nondegenerate Hermitian form on V . Define orthogonal complements of subspaces of V via this form. Let g \u2208 G and V g =\n{v \u2208 V | g * v = v}. We will need the observation that (V g )\u22a5 = im(g \u2212 1),\nwhich follows from the standard facts V g = ker(g \u2212 1), im(g \u2212 1) \u2282 (V g )\u22a5 , and\n\n\fTWISTED GRADED HECKE ALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\ndim(im(g \u22121)) = dim(ker(g \u22121)\u22a5 ). For any h \u2208 G, denote by h\u22a5 : (V g )\u22a5 \u2192 (V g )\u22a5\nthe composition of the linear maps h : (V g )\u22a5 \u0592\u2192 V , V \u2192 V /V g , and a choice of\n\u223c\nisomorphism V /V g \u2192 (V g )\u22a5 .\nLemma 2.8. Suppose that A is a twisted graded Hecke algebra for G defined by\nskew-symmetric bilinear forms ag (g \u2208 G) on V . For each g 6= 1, if ag 6= 0 then\nker ag = V g , codim(V g ) = 2, and\nag (h * v, h * w) = det(h\u22a5 )ag (v, w)\nfor all h \u2208 G and v, w \u2208 (V g )\u22a5 .\nThis proof is essentially the same as in Ram and Shepler [20, Lemma 1.8], with\nappropriate adjustments made for the possibly nontrivial two-cocycle \u03b1.\nProof. Let g 6= 1 with ag 6= 0. Let v \u2208 V and w \u2208 V g . If v is also in V g , then\nag (v, w)(g * u \u2212 u) = 0 for all u \u2208 V by (2.6). P\nAs g 6= 1, there is some u \u2208 V with\ng * u 6= u, so ag (v, w) = 0. If v 6\u2208 V g , let u = rk=1 g k * v, where r is the order of\ng, so that u \u2208 V g (possibly u = 0). As before, this implies ag (u, w) = 0, and we\nmay rewrite this equation using the definition of u and (2.5) as\n0 = ag (u, w) =\n=\n\nr\nX\n\nk=1\nr\nX\n\nag (g k * v, w)\n\u03b1\u22121 (g \u2212k , g k )\u03b1(g, g \u2212k )\u03b1(g k , g 1\u2212k )ag (v, w).\n\nk=1\n\nThe restriction of \u03b1 to the cyclic subgroup hgi generated by g is a coboundary\nsince the Schur multiplier of a cyclic group is trivial [14, Prop. 1.1]. Therefore\nthere is a function \u03b2 : hgi \u00d7 hgi \u2192 C\u00d7 such that \u03b1(h, l) = \u03b2(h)\u03b2(l)\u03b2 \u22121(hl) for all\nh, l \u2208 hgi. It follows that the above coefficients of ag (v, w) are\n\u03b1\u22121 (g \u2212k , g k )\u03b1(g, g \u2212k )\u03b1(g k , g 1\u2212k )\n= \u03b2 \u22121 (g \u2212k )\u03b2 \u22121 (g k )\u03b2(1)\u03b2(g)\u03b2(g \u2212k)\u03b2 \u22121 (g 1\u2212k )\u03b2(g k )\u03b2(g 1\u2212k )\u03b2 \u22121 (g)\n= \u03b2(1),\nthat is they are independent of k. The above calculation reduces to 0 = ag (u, w) =\nr\u03b2(1)ag (v, w). As r\u03b2(1) 6= 0, this forces ag (v, w) = 0. Consequently V g \u2282 ker ag ,\nand so (ker ag )\u22a5 \u2282 (V g )\u22a5 .\nAs ag is nonzero and skew-symmetric, we have dim((ker ag )\u22a5 ) = codim(ker ag ) \u2265\n2. Let u, v be two linearly independent elements of (ker ag )\u22a5 \u2282 (V g )\u22a5 with\nag (u, v) 6= 0, so that in particular g * u \u2212 u 6= 0 and g * v \u2212 v 6= 0. Let w be\nany element of (V g )\u22a5 = im(g \u2212 1), and write w = g * w \u2032 \u2212 w \u2032 for some w \u2032 \u2208 V . By\n(2.6), w is a linear combination of g *u\u2212u and g *v \u2212v, two elements of (V g )\u22a5 . This\nimplies dim(ker ag )\u22a5 = dim(V g )\u22a5 = 2, so that V g = ker ag and codim(V g ) = 2.\n\n\f6\n\nSARAH WITHERSPOON\n\nFinally, let v, w \u2208 (V g )\u22a5 , h \u2208 G, and\nh * v = a11 v + a21 w + x\nh * w = a12 v + a22 w + x\u2032\nwhere x, x\u2032 \u2208 V g and aij are scalars. Applying (2.5), we have ah\u22121 gh (v, w) =\n\u03b1\u22121 (h, h\u22121 )\u03b1(g, h)\u03b1(h\u22121, gh)ag (h * v, h * w) on the one hand, while evaluating via\nthe above equations yields\n(2.9)\nah\u22121 gh (v, w) = \u03b1\u22121 (h, h\u22121 )\u03b1(g, h)\u03b1(h\u22121, gh)ag (a11 v + a21 w + x, a12 v + a22 w + x\u2032 )\n= \u03b1\u22121 (h, h\u22121 )\u03b1(g, h)\u03b1(h\u22121, gh)(a11 a22 \u2212 a12 a21 )ag (v, w)\n= \u03b1\u22121 (h, h\u22121 )\u03b1(g, h)\u03b1(h\u22121, gh) det(h\u22a5 )ag (v, w).\nEquating the two expressions for ah\u22121 gh (v, w) gives ag (h*v, h*w) = det(h\u22a5 )ag (v, w),\nas desired.\n\u0003\nNow suppose g 6= 1, ag 6= 0, and h \u2208 C(g) = {h \u2208 G | hg = gh}. Then (2.9)\nis equivalent to det(h\u22a5 ) = \u03b1(h, h\u22121 )\u03b1\u22121 (g, h)\u03b1\u22121(h\u22121 , gh). Applying (2.1) to the\ntriple h, h\u22121 , gh, we find that \u03b1(h, h\u22121 )\u03b1\u22121 (h\u22121 , gh) = \u03b1(h, h\u22121 gh) = \u03b1(h, g) when\nh \u2208 C(g), so that det(h\u22a5 ) = \u03b1(h, g)\u03b1\u22121(g, h) for all h \u2208 C(g). This condition\nis independent of the choice of \u03b1 in a given coset modulo coboundaries since\ncoboundaries are symmetric on commuting pairs as is evident from (2.2). This is\nas expected since the determinant function is independent of such choices. Note\nthat as g \u2208 C(g), (2.9) implies det(g \u22a5 ) = 1, that is g \u2208 SL(V ). Further, in case g\nis \u03b1-regular, that is \u03b1(g, h) = \u03b1(h, g) for all h \u2208 C(g), this determinant condition\nis simply det(h\u22a5 ) = 1 for all h \u2208 C(g). For nonregular elements g, this condition\nis different from that in the case of the trivial cocycle, leading to new examples\nsuch as Examples 2.16 and 2.17 below.\nTheorem 2.10. Let G be a finite subgroup of GL(V ), \u03b1 : G \u00d7 G \u2192 C\u00d7 a normalized two-cocycle, and g \u2208 G \u2212 {1}. There is a twisted graded Hecke algebra A\nwith ag 6= 0 if, and only if, ker ag = V g , codim(V g ) = 2, and\n(2.11)\n\ndet(h\u22a5 ) = \u03b1(h, g)\u03b1\u22121(g, h)\n\nfor all h \u2208 C(g).\nAgain the proof is similar to that of Ram and Shepler [20, Thm. 1.9] in the\nuntwisted case. See also the paper of Etingof and Ginzburg [9], who used a\ncriterion of Braverman and Gaitsgory adapted to Koszul algebras over CG [3, 5].\nProof. If A is a twisted graded Hecke algebra, Lemma 2.8 and subsequent comments show the given conditions hold.\nConversely, suppose the stated conditions hold for g. Up to a scalar multiple,\nthere is a unique skew-symmetric form on V that is nondegenerate on (V g )\u22a5 and\n\n\fTWISTED GRADED HECKE ALGEBRAS\n\nhas kernel V g . Fix such a form ag , and let\n\u001a \u22121\n\u03b1 (h, h\u22121 )\u03b1(g, h)\u03b1(h\u22121, gh)ag (h * v, h * w),\n(2.12) ak (v, w) =\n0,\n\n7\n\nif k = h\u22121 gh\notherwise\n\nfor all v, w \u2208 V . In order for (2.5) to hold for all pairs of group elements, we must\ncheck that the definition of ak is independent of the choice of representative from\nthe conjugacy class of g. Suppose that k = l\u22121 h\u22121 ghl, so that there are two ways\nto define ak . One way yields\nak (v, w) = \u03b1\u22121 (hl, l\u22121 h\u22121 )\u03b1(g, hl)\u03b1(l\u22121h\u22121 , ghl)ag (hl * v, hl * w),\nand the other yields\nak (v, w)\n= \u03b1\u22121 (l, l\u22121 )\u03b1(h\u22121 gh, l)\u03b1(l\u22121 , h\u22121 ghl)\u03b1\u22121 (h, h\u22121 )\u03b1(g, h)\u03b1(h\u22121, gh)ag (hl * v, hl * w).\nThese two expressions for ak (v, w) are indeed equal, as follows from five applications of (2.1), to the triple h\u22121 , gh, l, to l\u22121 , h\u22121 , ghl, to g, h, l, to hl, l\u22121 , h\u22121 ,\nand to h, l, l\u22121 . By the discussion before Theorem 2.10, if h\u22121 gh = g, then (2.12)\ncoincides with ag (v, w). Therefore the definition of ak is independent of the choice\nof representative from the conjugacy class of g, and (2.5) holds. The argument of\n[20, Lemma 1.8(b)] applies without change to show that (2.6) holds as well: Their\nkey observation is that (2.6) holds trivially if any one of u, v, w is in V g , while\ndim(V g )\u22a5 = 2 implies that any three elements u, v, w of (V g )\u22a5 must be linearly\ndependent. Substituting a linear dependence relation into the left side of (2.6)\nyields 0 after some manipulation. Therefore A, defined by the {ak } in (2.12), is a\ntwisted graded Hecke algebra.\n\u0003\nIn summary, under the conditions in the theorem, ag is determined by its value\nag (v, w) on a basis v, w of (V g )\u22a5 , and for each h \u2208 G, ah\u22121 gh (v, w) is given by\n(2.12).\nCorollary 2.13. Let d be the number of conjugacy classes of g \u2208 G such that\ncodim V g = 2 and det(h\u22a5 ) = \u03b1(h, g)\u03b1\u22121(g, h) for all h \u2208 C(g). The sets {ag }g\u2208G\ncorresponding\ntwisted graded Hecke algebras A form a vector space of dimension\nV2 to\nG\nd + dim( V ) .\n\nProof. By (2.5) and (2.6), the only condition on a1 is a1 (v, w) = a1 (h * v, h * w)\n\u22121\n\u22121\nfor\nV2all \u2217h \u2208 G since \u03b1(h, h ) = \u03b1(h , h), that is a1 is a G-invariantg element of\n( V ) . For each conjugacy class of elements g \u2208 G with codim(V ) = 2 and\ndet(h\u22a5 ) = \u03b1(h, g)\u03b1\u22121(g, h) for all h \u2208 C(g), there are skew-symmetric forms ag\nwith kernel V g , determined by a single form ag (unique up to scalar multiple) for\na representative g, and given by (2.12).\n\u0003\n\n\f8\n\nSARAH WITHERSPOON\n\nRemark 2.14. The results of this section apply if we relax one of the conditions\non the forms ag a little: Allow ag to take values in C \u2295 V g , that is g-invariant\npolynomials of degree at most 1. Again let A be the quotient of T (V )#\u03b1 G[t] by\nthe ideal I[t] generated by all expressions of the form (2.3). As the image of each\nform ag has degree at most 1, the techniques of Ram and Shepler [20] still apply\nto yield\n\u0001\nah\u22121 gh (v, w) = \u03b1\u22121 (h, h\u22121 )\u03b1(g, h)\u03b1(h\u22121, gh) h\u22121 * ag (h * v, h * w)\nin place of (2.5), and (2.6) is unchanged (but now considered as a relation in\nS(V )). That is, these are necessary and sufficient conditions for A to be additively\nisomorphic to S(V ) \u2297 CG[t], leading to a generalization of Theorem 2.10.\nIn the remainder of this section, we give several examples.\nExample 2.15. (Symplectic groups.) Let V be a finite dimensional symplectic\nvector space over C, that is dim V is even and there is a nondegenerate skewsymmetric form \u03c9 : V \u00d7V \u2192 C. Let G be a finite subgroup of the symplectic group\nSp(V ) of all invertible linear transformations preserving \u03c9. Let \u03b1 : G \u00d7 G \u2192 C\u00d7\nbe the trivial two-cocycle \u03b1(g, h) = 1 for all g, h \u2208 G. For each element g \u2208 G such\nthat codim V g = 2 (the symplectic reflections), let ag = cg \u03c9g , where \u03c9g is defined\nto be \u03c9|(V g )\u22a5 on (V g )\u22a5 = im(1\u2212g) and 0 on V g = ker(1\u2212g), and where cg \u2208 C are\nscalars such that chgh\u22121 = cg for all h \u2208 G. Let a1 = c\u03c9 for a scalar c and ag = 0\nfor all other g \u2208 G. By [9, Thm. 1.3], the collection {ag | g \u2208 G} determines a\ngraded Hecke algebra, called a symplectic reflection algebra. By Corollary 2.13, the\nparameter space for the possible twisted graded Hecke algebras cannot be larger\nthan that for graded Hecke algebras in the symplectic case (cf. [7]).\nThe next two examples, by contrast, involve groups for which the parameter\nspace for twisted graded Hecke algebras is larger than that for graded Hecke algebras.\nExample 2.16. (Elementary abelian groups.) Let n \u2265 3, l \u2265 2, V = Cn and\nG\u223c\n= (Z/lZ)n\u22121 the multiplicative subgroup of Mn\u00d7n (C) generated by the diagonal\nmatrices (where q is a primitive lth root of 1):\ng1 = diag(q, q \u22121 , 1, . . . , 1)\ng2 = diag(1, q, q \u22121, 1, . . . , 1)\n..\n.\ngn\u22121 = diag(1, . . . , 1, q, q \u22121)\nDefine a function \u03b1 : G \u00d7 G \u2192 C\u00d7 by\ni\n\nj\n\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n, g1j1 * * * gn\u22121\n\u03b1(g1i1 * * * gn\u22121\n) = q\u2212\n\nP\n\n1\u2264k\u2264n\u22122 ik jk+1\n\n.\n\nThe relation (2.1) may be checked directly. For each generator gi (i = 1, . . . , n\u22121),\n\u22121\nas well as for gn = g1\u22121 * * * gn\u22121\n, we have det(h\u22a5 ) = \u03b1(h, gi )\u03b1\u22121 (gi , h) for all h \u2208 G,\n\n\fTWISTED GRADED HECKE ALGEBRAS\n\n9\n\nas follows from a straightforward computation. Thus we have a twisted graded\nHecke algebra in which the forms ag1 , . . . , agn are all nonzero (and other ag = 0).\n(Note that some of the relevant determinants are not 1. There is no nontrivial\n(untwisted) graded Hecke algebra in this case.) If l 6= 2, it may be checked that\nthis gives the full parameter space of twisted graded Hecke algebras corresponding\nto this cocycle \u03b1. If l = 2, this determinant condition is in fact satisfied for all g\nwith codim(V g ) = 2, and so there is a larger parameter space of twisted graded\nHecke algebras in this case. This example is discussed in a different context in [24,\nExample 4.1], which generalizes [6, Example 4.7].\nExample 2.17. (Symmetric groups.) Let G = Sn , acting on V = Cn by the\npermutation representation. Let \u03b1 be the unique nontrivial two-cocycle (up to\ncoboundary). The Schur representation group for Sn is\n\u0393n = ht1 , . . . , tn\u22121 , \u03c4 | \u03c4 2 = 1, t2i = 1, \u03c4 ti = ti \u03c4, (ti ti+1 )3 = 1, (ti tj )2 = \u03c4 (i \u2264 j \u2212 2)i.\n(See for example [14, p. 179].) A two-cocycle Sn \u00d7 Sn \u2192 C\u00d7 is determined up to\ncoboundary by an irreducible representation of the Schur representation group \u0393n\nfor which the central element \u03c4 necessarily acts as multiplication by a scalar. As\n\u03c4 2 = 1, this scalar must be \u22121 in case of the nontrivial cocycle \u03b1. Let g = (12)(34).\nThe presentation of \u0393n may be used to check that\ndet(h\u22a5 ) = \u03b1(h, g)\u03b1\u22121(g, h)\nfor all h \u2208 C(g). For example, letting h = (12), we have det(h\u22a5 ) = \u22121. Choose a\nsection T : Sn \u2192 \u0393n of the projection from \u0393n to Sn that sends \u03c4 to 1 and ti to the\ntransposition (i, i + 1) as follows: Let T (12) = t1 , T (34) = t3 , T ((12)(34)) = t1 t3 ,\nand choose other images arbitrarily. Then \u03b1(h, g)\u03b1\u22121(g, h) is the scalar by which\nthe following element acts on an irreducible representation of \u0393n :\nT (12)T ((12)(34))T ((12)(12)(34))\u22121T ((12)(34)(12))T (12)\u22121T ((12)(34))\u22121\n= T (12)T (12)T (34)T (34)\u22121T (34)T (12)\u22121T ((12)(34))\u22121\n= T (34)T (12)T (34)T (12)\n= \u03c4,\nthus the scalar is \u22121 as desired. Other elements h of C(g) may be checked similarly;\nas h 7\u2192 det(h\u22a5 ) is a group homomorphism, it suffices to check the condition\n(2.11) on generators of C(g). Therefore there is a twisted graded Hecke algebra\ncorresponding to \u03b1 with ag 6= 0. (Compare with trivial \u03b1, where ag is necessarily\n0 for this choice of g [20, Table 1].) With the choice g = (123), we find as in the\ncase of the trivial cocycle \u03b1, that 1 = det(h\u22a5 ) = \u03b1(h, g)\u03b1\u22121(g, h) for all h \u2208 C(g).\nTherefore the parameter space of twisted graded Hecke algebras is larger than\nthat of graded Hecke algebras, and involves the conjugacy classes of all g \u2208 G for\nwhich codim V g = 2.\n\n\f10\n\nSARAH WITHERSPOON\n\n3. Deformations of crossed products\nIn this section, we prove that the twisted graded Hecke algebras of the previous\nsection are precisely the deformations of S(V )#\u03b1 G of a particular type. We use\nthis connection to deformations to put our results and examples in a larger context.\nLet t be an indeterminate. Given any associative algebra R over C (for example\nR = S(V )#\u03b1 G), a deformation of R over C[t] is an associative C[t]-algebra with\nunderlying vector space R[t] = C[t] \u2297 R and multiplication of the form\nr \u2217 s = rs + \u03bc1 (r, s)t + \u03bc2 (r, s)t2 + * * * + \u03bcp (r, s)tp\nfor all r, s \u2208 R, where rs denotes the product of r and s in R, the \u03bci : R\u00d7R \u2192 R are\nC-bilinear maps extended to be C[t]-bilinear, and p depends on r, s. Associativity\nof \u2217 implies that \u03bc1 is a Hochschild two-cocycle, that is\n(3.1)\n\n\u03bc1 (w, r)s + \u03bc1 (wr, s) = \u03bc1 (w, rs) + w\u03bc1 (r, s)\n\nfor all w, r, s \u2208 R, as well as further conditions on the \u03bci , i \u2265 1. The cocycle \u03bc1\nis called the infinitesimal of the deformation. (See [10] or [11] for the details from\nalgebraic deformation theory.)\nRecall that S(V )#\u03b1 G is a graded algebra where we assign degree 1 to elements\nof V and degree 0 to elements of G.\nTheorem 3.2. Up to isomorphism, the twisted graded Hecke algebras are precisely\nthe deformations of S(V )#\u03b1 G over C[t] for which deg \u03bci = \u22122i (i \u2265 1).\nProof. Let A be a twisted graded Hecke algebra, as defined in Section 2. Let\nv1 , . . . , vn be a basis of V and choose the section of the projection from T (V )\nto S(V ) in which a word in T (V ) is written in the order v1i1 * * * vnin . Express\nall elements of A in terms of this section, writing group elements on the right.\nSuch expressions in A exist and are unique due to the additive isomorphism A \u223c\n=\nS(V )#\u03b1 G[t]. Now let r = v1i1 * * * vnin g and s = v1j1 * * * vnjn h be elements of A.\nDenoting the product in A by \u2217, we have\nr \u2217 s = \u03b1(g, h)v1i1 * * * vnin \u2217 (g * v1j1 * * * vnjn )gh.\nThe factor v1i1 * * * vnin (g * v1j1 * * * vnjn ) may now be rearranged using (2.3) repeatedly\nuntil it is in the standard form for elements of A discussed above. The result will\nbe of the form\nr \u2217 s = rs + \u03bc1 (r, s)t + \u03bc2 (r, s)t2 + * * * + \u03bcp (r, s)tp ,\nwhere rs is identified with the product of r and s in S(V )#\u03b1 G, via the additive isomorphism A \u223c\n= S(V )#\u03b1 G[t], and \u03bc1 (r, s), . . . , \u03bcp (r, s) are elements of A\nalso identified with elements of S(V )#\u03b1 G. This is a finite process as each time\n(2.3) is applied, the degree drops. As the multiplication \u2217 in the twisted graded\nHecke algebra A is bilinear and associative, the maps \u03bci are bilinear and thus\nA is a deformation of S(V )#\u03b1 G over C[t]. (Alternatively, the existence of the\n\n\fTWISTED GRADED HECKE ALGEBRAS\n\n11\n\nobvious algebra isomorphism A/tA \u223c\n= S(V )#\u03b1 G implies that A is a deformation\nof S(V )#\u03b1 G over C[t].)

By definition, A \u223c\n= S(V )#\u03b1 G[t] as a vector space over C[t].\nDefine a C[t]-linear map \u03c6 : T (V )#\u03b1 G[t] \u2192 A by\n\u03c6(vi1 * * * vim g) = vi1 \u2217 * * * \u2217 vim \u2217 g\nfor all words vi1 * * * vim in T (V ) and g \u2208 G. It may be checked that \u03c6 is an\nalgebra homomorphism since T (V ) is free on v1 , . . . , vn , and since \u03bci (C\u03b1 G, C\u03b1 G) =\n\u03bci (C\u03b1 G, V ) = \u03bci (V, C\u03b1 G) = 0 for all i \u2265 1 by the degree condition on \u03bci . We will\nshow, by induction on degree, that \u03c6 is surjective: First note that \u03c6(g) = g and\n\u03c6(vg) = vg for all v \u2208 V , g \u2208 G. Now we would like to show that an arbitrary basis\nmonomial vi1 * * * vim g (i1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 im ) of A is in im(\u03c6). Assume vi2 * * * vim g = \u03c6(X)\nfor some element X of T (V )#\u03b1 G[t]. Then\n\u03c6(vi1 X) = \u03c6(vi1 ) \u2217 \u03c6(X)\n= vi1 \u2217 vi2 * * * vim g\n= vi1 * * * vim g + \u03bc1 (vi1 , vi2 * * * vim g)t + \u03bc2 (vi1 , vi2 * * * vim g)t2 + * * *\nBy induction on m, as \u03bci is a map of degree \u22122i, each \u03bcj (vi1 , vi2 * * * vim g) is in\nim(\u03c6). This implies vi1 * * * vim g \u2208 im(\u03c6), and thus \u03c6 is surjective.\nIt remains to determine the kernel of \u03c6. Letting v, w \u2208 V , we find that\n\u03c6(vw) = v \u2217 w = vw + \u03bc1 (v, w)t\n\u03c6(wv) = w \u2217 v = wv + \u03bc1 (w, v)t,\nsince deg \u03bci = \u22122i. As vw = wv in S(V ), we may subtract to obtain \u03c6(vw \u2212wv) =\n(\u03bc1 (v, w) \u2212 \u03bc1 (w, v))t. Since deg \u03bc1 = \u22122 and \u03c6(g) = g for all g \u2208 G, this implies\nthat\n(3.3)\n\nvw \u2212 wv \u2212 (\u03bc1 (v, w) \u2212 \u03bc1 (w, v))t\n\nis in the kernel of \u03c6 for all v, w \u2208 V . It also follows, as deg \u03bc1 = \u22122, that\nX\n\u03bc1 (v, w) \u2212 \u03bc1 (w, v) =\nag (v, w)g\ng\u2208G\n\nfor some functions ag : V \u00d7 V \u2192 C. By definition, ag is bilinear and skewsymmetric for each g \u2208 G. Let I[t] be the ideal of T (V )#\u03b1 G[t] generated by all\nsuch expressions (3.3), so that I[t] \u2282 ker \u03c6. We will use a dimension count to show\nthat I[t] = ker \u03c6: By the arguments of the previous section, T (V )#\u03b1 G[t]/I[t] is a\nquotient of S(V )#\u03b1 G[t], and so has dimension in each degree no greater than that\nof S(V )#\u03b1 G[t]. Since \u03c6 induces a map from T (V )#\u03b1 G[t]/I[t] onto S(V )#\u03b1 G[t],\nthis forces I[t] = ker \u03c6 and thus A is a twisted graded Hecke algebra.\n\u0003\n\n\f12\n\nSARAH WITHERSPOON\n\nThe proof of Theorem 3.2 shows that the skew-symmetric forms ag appearing\nin the relations (2.3) of a twisted graded Hecke algebra arise as coefficients in the\nskew-symmetrization of a Hochschild two-cocycle \u03bc1 on S(V )#\u03b1 G. Hochschild\ncohomology thus provides an alternate approach to the study of twisted graded\nHecke algebras. An advantage of this approach is that it puts the computation\nof the possible skew-symmetric forms ag into a larger context. A disadvantage\nis that, given a Hochschild two-cocycle \u03bc1 on an algebra R, there is no general\nmethod for determining whether it lifts to a deformation of R, nor for finding the \u03bci\n(i \u2265 2) in case it does lift. In case deg(\u03bc1 ) = \u22121, Remark 2.14 points to existence\nof deformations of S(V )#\u03b1 G defined by quotients of T (V )#\u03b1 G[t] analogous to\ntwisted graded Hecke algebras. There are a few special cases where deformations\nof S(V )#\u03b1 G are known whose infinitesimals \u03bc1 have arbitrarily high degree [6,\n24]. These examples were discovered after examining the relevant Hochschild\ncohomology:\n!G\nM V q\u2212codim V g\nq\n((V g )\u2217 ) \u2297 det(((V g )\u22a5 )\u2217 ) \u2297 S(V g )g\nHH (S(V )#\u03b1 G) \u223c\n=\ng\u2208G\n\nadditively, where the superscript G denotes elements invariant under the action\ninduced by conjugation in C\u03b1 G and the action of G on V , and det denotes the\ntop exterior power. This follows from [12], see (6.2) and the formula before (6.4)\nwhere S(V ) is replaced by C[M], or more directly from the techniques of [2], where\nS(V ) is replaced by a Weyl algebra.\n\nWe conclude by giving a broader context for the isomorphism found by Ram\nand Shepler between Lusztig's and Drinfeld's definitions of (untwisted) graded\nHecke algebras for real reflection groups [8, 17, 20]. Let W \u2282 GL(V ) be a finite\nreal reflection group. Specifically, W is generated by simple reflections s1 , . . . , sn\ncorresponding to simple roots \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n \u2208 V for a root system R in V . If \u03b1 \u2208 R\nis any root, we write s\u03b1 for the reflection corresponding to \u03b1, so that\ns\u03b1 * v = v \u2212 hv, \u03b1\u02c7i\u03b1\nwhere \u03b1\u02c7 = 2\u03b1/h\u03b1, \u03b1i, and h , i is the inner product. For each \u03b1 \u2208 R, choose\nk\u03b1 \u2208 C in such a way that kg*\u03b1 = k\u03b1 for all g \u2208 W , so that the number of\nindependent parameters k\u03b1 is simply the number of different lengths of roots.\nLusztig's graded version of an affine Hecke algebra, as defined over C[t], is the\nquotient A\u2032 of T (V )#W [t] by the ideal generated by all\n[v, w] and si v \u2212 (si * v)si + k\u03b1i hv, \u03b1i \u02c7it\nwhere v, w \u2208 V and i = 1, . . . , n.\nRam and Shepler defined the following graded Hecke algebra and showed that it\nis isomorphic to Lusztig's algebra A\u2032 given above (and their isomorphism extends\n\n\fTWISTED GRADED HECKE ALGEBRAS\n\n13\n\nto one over C[t]): For each g \u2208 W , let\n1 X\nk\u03b1 k\u03b2 (hv, \u03b2\u02c7ihw, \u03b1\u02c7i \u2212 hv, \u03b1\u02c7ihw, \u03b2\u02c7i) .\nag (v, w) =\n4 \u03b1,\u03b2>0\ng=s\u03b1 s\u03b2\n\nIn order to make the connection to Lusztig's version, replace t by t2 in (2.3) and\ntake the quotient A of T (V )#W [t] by the ideal generated by all\nX\n[v, w] \u2212\nag (v, w)t2g.\ng\u2208W\n\nThe resulting quotient algebra A is in fact a graded Hecke algebra defined over\nC[t2 ], however the isomorphism with Lusztig's algebra A\u2032 is not defined over C[t2 ].\nThis isomorphism \u03a6t : A\u2032 \u2192 A is given by\n\n\u03a6t (v) = v \u2212 thv, hi and \u03a6t (g) = g\n1X\n1X\nfor all v \u2208 V, g \u2208 W , where h =\nk\u03b1 \u03b1\u02c7s\u03b1 , and hv, hi =\nk\u03b1 hv, \u03b1\u02c7is\u03b1 .\n2 \u03b1>0\n2 \u03b1>0\nThis may be extended uniquely to an algebra isomorphism by the calculations of\nRam and Shepler. The reason for replacing t by t2 in the definition of A is that\nit is necessary in order to extend their isomorphism to one defined over C[t]. The\nonly calculation that changes significantly in this context occurs in the proof that\n[\u03a6t (v), \u03a6t (w)] = [v, w] + t2 [hv, hi, hw, hi] \u2212 t[v, hw, hi] + t[w, hv, hi] = 0.\nP\nThis is true as [v, hw, hi] = [w, hv, hi] and [hv, hi, hw, hi] = \u2212 g\u2208W ag (v, w)g by\ncomputations in the proof of [20, Thm. 3.5].\nIn particular, the isomorphism \u03a6t is an equivalence of deformations over C[t].\nThis implies that the Hochschild two-cocycle corresponding to the coefficients of t\nin the deformation A\u2032 of S(V )#W is a coboundary, however there is a Hochschild\ntwo-cocycle arising from the coefficients of t2 in products in A\u2032 that will be cohomologous to that for A.
