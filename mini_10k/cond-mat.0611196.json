Sham\nDepartment of Physics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0319\nA particular difficulty in studying many-body interactions in a solid is the absence of an experimental technique that can directly probe their key characteristics. We show that 2D Fourier\nspectroscopy provides an efficient tool for the measurement of critical parameters describing the\neffect of many-body interactions on the optical response of semiconductors. We develop the basic\nmicroscopic theory of 2D Fourier spectroscopy of semiconductors in the framework of the threeband model (heavy holes, light holes, and electrons). The theory includes many-body correlations\nnonperturbatively and can be generalized straightforwardly in order to describe 2D Fourier spectra obtained in atomic physics. We establish a relation between the 2D Fourier spectrum and the\nmany-body correlations. It is shown, in particular, that 2D Fourier spectroscopy provides a principal\npossibility to establish experimentally the origin of the fast decay of the memory term describing the\nCoulomb interaction between heavy- and light-hole excitons. The theory is applied to an analysis of\nthe available experimental data. Experiments providing more detailed information are suggested.\n\nUnderstanding many-body interactions in solids is one\nof the key problems of modern solid state physics (see,\nfor instance, the recent review Ref. 1). The long-range\nCoulomb interaction between electrons leads to complex\ndynamics of the excitations in semiconductors and plays\nthe principal role in the nonlinear optical response. Different experimental techniques have been developed for\nstudying the effects of many-body interactions. One of\nthe most popular experiments is based on the four-wave\nmixing (FWM)2 . In these experiments the sample is illuminated by rays characterized by (non-parallel) wave\nvectors k1 , k2 , and k3 . The outgoing signal is detected\nin the direction that corresponds to the nonlinear coupling of the excitation pulses, say, \u2212k1 + k2 + k3 . The\nadvantage of such measurements is that the many-body\ncontribution to the signal is not blurred by the strong\nlinear (single-particle) component. The sensitivity of the\nFWM spectrum to the details of the interaction between\nthe excitons and other many-body excitations makes it\nan efficient tool for probing the many-body properties.\nHowever, the standard FWM experiment does not allow\none to make a distinction between different contributions\nof many-body interactions and correlations to the shape\nof the resonance. As a result it is difficult to interpret a\nFWM spectrum and to extract specific characteristics of\nthe many-body interactions and correlations.\nRecently the more flexible technique of twodimensional Fourier spectroscopy3,4,5 has been applied\nto studying the semiconductor properties6,7 . The general scheme is similar to that of standard time-resolved\nFWM experiments with three pulses propagating along\nk1 , k2 , and k3 launched at t = t1 , t2 , and t3 , respectively. The difference from a standard FWM experiment\nis that measurements are performed not at a fixed or just\na few values of the delay time \u03c4 = min(t2 , t3 ) \u2212 t1 , but\nrather for a dense series of values lying in some interval. Subsequently, the Fourier transforms are done with\n\nrespect to the delay time as well as with respect to the\nsignal time. These two Fourier transforms constitute the\ntwo-dimensional Fourier spectrum. It is important to\nemphasize that in the experiments reported in Refs. 6,7\nthe difficult problem of measuring both the real and the\nimaginary parts of the signal was resolved. These experiments, therefore, provide the information about the\nphase acquired during the delay time. As will be shown\nbelow, this allows one to make a distinction between the\ndiffraction on the gratings created by the heavy- and the\nlight-hole excitons. Thus, 2D Fourier spectroscopy experiments give substantial insight into the details of the\nmany-body correlations and provide vital information,\nwhich is barely accessible using the standard approach.\nDespite many advantages provided by the 2D Fourier\nspectroscopy, the application of this technique suffers\nfrom the lack of the understanding of the spectra from the\nmicroscopic standpoint. Usually, 2D Fourier spectra are\ndescribed in the framework of the phenomenology of the\nnonlinear susceptibility, which hides the relation between\nfeatures of the spectra and the microscopic characteristics of the system.\nHere we develop the basic microscopic theory of 2D\nFourier spectroscopy of the semiconductors in the framework of the three-band model (heavy holes, light holes,\nand electrons). We use the perturbational approach with\nrespect to the excitation field. The interaction between\nthe excitons, on the contrary, is taken into account exactly. We show that the 2D Fourier spectrum gives the\nunique opportunity to measure the key quantities describing the exciton-exciton interaction. We use our theory to analyze the experimental results of Ref. 6. Our\ncalculations produce relations between the spectral features of the 2D Fourier spectrum and the parameters\ncharacterizing the many-body interaction that allow us\nto suggest experiments that would provide more detailed\ninformation. Because of the generality of the approach,\n\n\f2\nour theory is able to describe also the 2D Fourier spectra\nof other physical systems, such as molecular nanostructures.\nThe basic idea behind the derivation of the equations of\nmotion of the exciton polarization is that the states with\nthe definite number of particles are the eigenstates of the\nHamiltonian of the unperturbed (i.e. without external\nfield) semiconductor. Initially, before the first pulse hits\nthe sample, the system is assumed to be in the vacuum\nstate |0i with full valence and empty conduction bands.\nThe excitation pulses couple the eigenstates of the system populating, thereby, states with different number of\n(l)\nparticles. The excitation pulses create directly P\u03ba , the\nlinear response polarization. This excitation is described\nin the rotating-wave approximation by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n(1)\n+ i\u03c9\u03ba + \u0393\u03ba P\u03ba(l) = \u2212dE\u03c3(l)\u03ba (t),\n\u2202t\nwhere l = 1, 2, 3 enumerates the exciton pulses according\nto their time order. Here and below the Greek letters\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd are multi-indices denoting the exciton state\naccording to \u03ba = {n\u03ba , \u03c3\u03ba }, where n\u03ba is the type of the\nexciton equal to h or to l for heavy-hole and light-hole\nexcitons, respectively, and \u03c3\u03ba is the helicity of the state.\nIn Eq. (1) we have introduced \u0393\u03ba as the decay rate of\nthe exciton state \u03ba, and \u03c9\u03ba as the detuning, which is the\ndifference between the frequency of the rotating frame\nand the exciton frequency \u03c9\ne\u03ba . The external source is\nspecified by the dipole moment d and by the component\n(l)\nof the l-th pulse, E\u03c3\u03ba (t), with the helicity \u03c3\u03ba . The lin(l)\near responses P\u03ba , in turn, serve as sources of the thirdorder polarization. The dynamics of the third-order polarization is conveniently written in terms of the operator\nD\u03bc\u03bd = [B\u03bc , [B\u03bd , H]], where H is the Hamiltonian of the\nunperturbed semiconductor and the operator B\u03bc\u2020 creates\nan exciton in the state \u03bc.

Obviously, interactions involving higher number of particles do not contribute to the third-order polarization.\n\u03ba\u03bb\nThese parameters are defined by \u03b2\u03bc\u03bd\n= D\u03ba\u03bb B\u03bc\u2020 B\u03bd\u2020 and\n\u03ba\u03bb\n\u2020\n. The last term in Eq.

(1) and (2) we need to take into\naccount only the excitons with helicity of unit magnitude, i.e. the ones coupled to the one-photon states of\nelectromagnetic field. Therefore, in what follows, we will\nconsider only excitons with \u03c3\u03ba = \u00b11.\nWe would like to emphasize that Eq. (2) exactly\naccounts for the Coulomb interaction between excitons.\nThe generality of the basic ideas and nonrestrictive assumptions make this equation virtually\nmodel-independent. However, in order to present the\nrelation between the 2D Fourier spectrum and the parameters characterizing the many-body interaction in the\nmost transparent way, we restrict ourselves to the shortmemory approximation.8 The effect of non-locality of the\nmemory function on the 2D Fourier spectrum will be investigated elsewhere.

The experimental value of the slope is found to be equal to \u22121.3. We\nwould like to stress the universality of the slope and to\nemphasize that such a good agreement with the experiment is provided by the fact that the (\u03c9h , \u2212\u03c9h )-resonance\nis the strongest one and the slope of the zero line is\nweakly affected by other resonances.

The slope takes the value \u22124/3 in the limit\nwhen the Pauli blocking can be neglected.\nFrom the experimental data of Ref. 6 we find the parameters A\u03bd\u03bc using the least-square method. The exciton\nparameters \u03c9\u03bc and \u0393\u03bc are tuned in order to minimize the\ndeviation between the theory and the experiment. The\nresults of the fit are shown in Table I. The 2D Fourier\nspectrum corresponding to the fitted parameters is depicted in Fig. 1.\nThe difficulty of extracting more detailed information\nfrom the results of Ref. 6 is that the measurements were\n0\n\n\f5\nperformed using linearly polarized pulses and the linearly\npolarized signal was detected. Much more detailed information can be obtained if the signals with circular polarization, i.e. with fixed helicity, are used. As follows\nfrom Eq. (11) a particular choice of the helicities of the\nexcitation pulses and the detected signal allows a direct\ne\naccess to particular \u03b2's.\nFor example, if the excitation\npulses have helicity \u03c3 = +1 and a signal with \u03c3 = +1\nis detected, then each resonance in (\u03c9, \u03a9)-plane will be\n,+1\ndetermined by the specific \u03b2enn\u03bc\u03bd ,+1\n. It is interesting to\nnote that this provides the principal possibility to obtain\nexperimentally the information about the origin of the\nfast decay of the memory term describing the Coulomb\ninteraction between the heavy- and light-hole excitons.\nIndeed, this particular choice of the helicities excludes\nthe contribution from the interaction between {h, +1}\nl,+1\nand {l, \u22121} excitons, so that only the term \u221d \u03b3h,+1\nwill\nmostly contribute. If the memory decay is caused by the\nshort biexciton life-time then, as follows from Eq. (4),\nh,+1\nthis should result in imaginary \u03b2el,+1\n. This will not be\n\u03ba\u03bb\nthe case if the respective matrix elements of F\u03bc\u03bd\n(t) decay\n9\nfaster than 1/(\u0393\u03bc + \u0393\u03bd ).\nWe would like to note that even more flexible access\nto different matrix elements of \u03b2e\u03bc\u03bd is provided by the observational scheme with the time separating second and\nthird pulses equal to the delay time, T = \u03c4 . In this\nscheme the different sequences of excitation pulses, which\nenter symmetrically Eq. (8), turn out to produce different resonances along \u03a9-axis. As a result, the 2D Fourier\nspectrum obtained using this scheme has four resonances\nalong the vertical axis separated by \u03c9l \u2212 \u03c9h .\nWe conclude by considering briefly the effect of inhomogeneous broadening. The broadening is taken into account by averaging the spectrum with respect to a joint\ndistribution of the exciton frequencies. First, we note\nthe different effect of the inhomogeneous broadening on\nthe diagonal and off-diagonal resonances. While averaging is performed the resonances situated near (\u03c9\u03bc , \u2212\u03c9\u03bc )\nmove along the diagonal resulting in elongating resonances in this direction.

(10), the\nhalf-width in the perpendicular direction \u03b4\u03bc of the magnitude of the signal near (\u03c9\u03bc , \u2212\u03c9\u03bc ) is found from the\nequation (\u03b4\u03bc2 + 2\u03932\u03bc )2 (\u03b4\u03bc2 + 18\u03932\u03bc ) = 144\u03936\u03bc and is equal\nto \u03b4\u03bc \u2248 0.88\u0393\u03bc . Applying this relation to the spectra obtained in Ref. 6 we obtain \u0393h \u2248 1.2meV and\n\u0393l \u2248 1.4meV, which are in a agreement with the values\nfound in Table I.\nThe effect of the inhomogeneous broadening on the\noff-diagonal resonances is determined by the relation between the distributions of the frequencies of the heavyhole and light-hole excitons. For not too high values of\nthe broadening the value of the light-hole \u2013 heavy-hole\nsplitting can be considered to be fixed. As a result, averaging leads to elongation of the off-diagonal resonance\nalong respective line, whose slope depends on the ratio\nbetween the values of inhomogeneous broadenings of the\nlight-hole and heavy-hole excitons.\nIn summary, we have developed the basic microscopic\ntheory of 2D Fourier spectroscopy of semiconductors. We\nhave shown that the resonant peculiarities in 2D Fourier\nspectrum are directly related to respective microscopic\nquantities describing the exciton-exciton interaction. Because of the two-dimensional structure of the spectrum\nthe contributions from the Coulomb interaction between\ndifferent excitons (heavy- and light-hole) turn out to be\nnaturally separated. We demonstrate, in that way, that\n2D Fourier spectroscopy provides a unique opportunity\nto extract the information regarding many-body correlations in semiconductors from direct measurements. In\nparticular, we show that it is possible to obtain experimentally the information regarding the origin of the fast\ndecay of the memory term describing the Coulomb interaction between the heavy-hole and light-hole excitons.\nWe have given a simple application of the theory analyzing the experimental data reported in Ref. 6.\nWe would like to thank Xiaoqin Li and Steve Cundiff\nfor useful discussions.
