Quantum criticality is a property of the\nground state of the system, ultimately arising from a\nreshuffling of the system's energy spectrum when control\nparameters are varied. In many cases, this is accompanied by a symmetry breaking and by the appearance of\nan order parameter indicating that the macroscopic order is reached, characterized by long range correlations.\nThere also exist phase transitions with vanishing local\norder parameter. A typical example is the BerezinskiiKosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, occurring, e.g. in\na system of planar classical spins at a finite temperature\n[2]. The transition is characterized by a 'distortion' of\ntopological nature of the spatial spin configuration, giving rise to quasi-long-range order in the system, whose\ncorrelation functions display a power-law decay [3]. In\nthe present paper we will be dealing with ground states\nof one dimensional systems displaying topological order.\nThe topological order in one dimension is peculiar and it\ncan be characterized by a sensitivity of the ground state\nby varying the boundary conditions, giving rise to certain\nsolitonic edge states (see for instance [4]).\nThe prospect of practical applications, such as quantum information processing, has led to an intense activity aimed at a direct inspection of the properties of\nthe ground state of a given system. Our purpose is to\ncharacterize ground states with a non trivial topological\norder through their entanglement content [5]. To illustrate what we believe are generic features of topologically\nordered states with vanishing local order parameter, we\nfocus on a specific system: the spin 1/2 XX chain in\nexternal magnetic field. According to the general equivalence between the classical-d + 1 and quantum-d criticality [6], this model displays a QPT from a polarized\nto a BKT phase with quasilong range order. For such\na model, we demonstrate that the quasi-long range or-\n\nder manifests itself in the formation of 'entangled edge\nstates' (with spins at the edge of the chain sharing entanglement quite differently from bulk spins) and that\nit is characterized at finite size by an instability of the\nground state determined by a sequence of energy level\ncrossings as the magnetic field is varied[7]. This gives\nrise to sudden jumps of both the fidelity[8] and the pairwise entanglement (which, thus, behave non-analytically\neven at finite size). As the size of the chain increases,\nthe number of crossings grows until they become dense\nwithin a sharply defined critical region. At the same\ntime, their effect weakens, and the behavior of an infinite\nchain can be obtained through a smearing of the finite\nsize observables, a procedure that we apply to the partial state fidelity. Again, however, this holds true only\nfor bulk spins, while those at the boundaries show a kind\nof rigidity and a reduced sensitivity to the QPT.\n\nTHE GROUND STATE OF THE XX MODEL\n\nWe consider N spin 1/2 particles on a line, coupled by\nnearest neighbor XX interaction, with Hamiltonian\nH = \u2212J\n\nN\nhX\n1\ni=1\n\n2\n\ny\nx\n(\u03c3ix \u03c3i+1\n+ \u03c3iy \u03c3i+1\n) + B\u03c3iz\n\ni\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the exchange constant J has been taken as the\nenergy unit. In the thermodynamic limit, the system\nundergoes a first order transition from a fully polarized\nto a critical phase with quasi-long range order [3, 9].\nAssuming open boundaries (with \u03c3N +1 = 0), we employ the Jordan-Wigner and Fourier transformations to\nintroduce the fermion operators\ndk =\n\nr\n\nN\n\n2 X\nsin\nN +1\nl=1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0kl\nN +1\n\n\u0013 O\nl\u22121\n\nm=1\n\nz \u2212\n\u03c3m\n\u03c3l ,\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nPN\n\u2020\nthat diagonalize H: H =\nk=1 \u039bk dk dk + N B 11 with\n\u039bk = \u22122B + 2 cos [(\u03c0k)/(N + 1)].

Specifically, when B > 1, \u039bk < 0 for any k\nand, thus, the lowest eigenvalue is obtained by taking\nthe state with \u03b1k = 1 \u2200k. The ground state energy remains \u01eb0g = \u2212N B as long as B > cos [\u03c0/(N + 1)]. For\nthese values of BQno level crossing occurs; the ground\n\u2020\nstate is |\u03c8g0 i = N\nl=1 dl |\u03a9i. The first crossing occurs\nat B = cos[\u03c0/(N + 1)] \u2261 B1 . For cos[2\u03c0/(N + 1)] <\nB < cos[\u03c0/(N + 1)] all of the \u039bk are negative except for \u039b1 . Thus, the ground state energy is obtained\nby subtracting its positive contribution: \u01eb1g = \u01eb0g \u2212 \u039b1 .\nThe corresponding eigenstate is |\u03c8g1 i = d1 |\u03c8g0 i. Letting Bk = cos[k\u03c0/(N + 1)] and defining the k-th region,\nBk+1 < B < Bk , we can iterate the procedure above\nto find the ground state |\u03c8gk i = dk dk\u22121 * * * d1 |\u03c8g0 i =\nQN\n\u2020\nl=k+1 dl |\u03a9i and its energy as\n\n\u01ebkg\n\n(a)\n1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere |l1 , l2 , * * * , lk i is the state with flipped spins at\nsites l1 , l2 , * * * , lk , while the amplitudes are given by\nP\nP (3)\nP P (1) P (2)\nSl2 * * * Sl3 , where the\nCl1 l2 ***lk =\nP (\u22121) Sl1\nsum extends over the permutation group. At each crossing point, the ground state jumps discontinuously in the\nspin Hilbert space from one symmetric subspace to another, orthogonal to the previous one.\n\nWe now study ground state correlation, entanglement\nand fidelity at finite size. Due to the symmetry of\nthe overall state, the one-spin reduced density matrix\nis purely diagonal, \u03c1l = 12 diag(1 + h\u03c3lz i, 1 \u2212 h\u03c3lz i); while\nfor two spins at sites (l, m), one has \u03c1lm = a+ | \u2191\u2191ih\u2191\u2191\n| + a\u2212 | \u2193\u2193ih\u2193\u2193 | + b+ | \u2191\u2193ih\u2191\u2193 | + b\u2212 | \u2193\u2191ih\u2193\u2191 | + e(| \u2191\u2193ih\u2193\u2191\nz\nz\n|+| \u2193\u2191ih\u2191\u2193 |), with a\u00b1 = 14 [1\u00b1h\u03c3lz i\u00b1h\u03c3m\ni+h\u03c3lz \u03c3m\ni], b\u00b1 =\n1\n1\nz\nz\nz z\nx x\n[1\n\u00b1\nh\u03c3\ni\n\u2213\nh\u03c3\ni\n\u2212\nh\u03c3\n\u03c3\ni]\nand\ne\n=\nh\u03c3\n\u03c3\ni.\nHere,\nthe\nm\nl\nl m\nl m\n4\n2\nlocal magnetization and transverse correlation are given\nz\n2\nby h\u03c3lz i = 1\u2212gl,l and h\u03c3lz \u03c3m\ni = (1\u2212gl,l )(1\u2212gm,m )\u2212gl,m\n,\nwhere\ngl,m = 2\n\nk\nX\nr=1\n\nr\nSlr Sm\n=\n\nk\nk+1\nS k+1 Sm\n\u2212 Slk Sm\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011i , (5)\nh l\u0010\n\u03c0m\n2 cos N\u03c0l\n+1 \u2212 cos N +1\n\nthat depends on the field B through the index k. The\nx\nlongitudinal correlation function h\u03c3lx \u03c3m\ni is [10]:\nGl,l+1\nGl+1,l+1\nx\nh\u03c3lx \u03c3m\ni=\n..\n.\nGm\u22121,l+1\n\nGl,l+2 . . . Gl,m\nGl+1,l+2 . . .

For\nx\nnearest neighbors, we simply get h\u03c3lx \u03c3l+1\ni = Gl,l+1 .\n\n\f3\nWith these density matrices at hand, we discuss the entanglement encoded in the state. Entanglement between\na single spin and the rest of the chain can be measured\nby the one-tangle \u03c4l = 1 \u2212 h\u03c3lz i2 [11]. This quantity depends on the site for finite chain, and, as a function of B,\nit displays jumps at each crossing point Bk . Specifically:\n(i) \u03c4l equals one at zero field for every site; (ii) the jumps\nnear B = \u00b11 become higher and higher moving from the\nend points towards the center of the chain, see Fig. 1\n(a). Thus, at the onset of the critical region, bulk spins\nare more entangled than end ones.\nTo evaluate pairwise entanglement,\nwe use\no the concurn\n\u221a\nrence [11], Cl,m = 2 max 0, |e| \u2212 a+ a\u2212 . Its behavior as a function of B for nearest neighboring spins with\njumps at crossing points is shown in Fig. 1 (b). In particular, around B = 0, the pairwise entanglement is bigger\nnear the end points of the chain; while the reverse occurs\nat the border of the critical region.\nThe QPT can be further analyzed through the quantum fidelity of ground states with slightly different fields,\nB and B\u0303 = B + \u03b4B. Specifically, we consider the partial\nstate fidelity of reduced density matrix \u03c1a (B) = Trb \u03c1(B)\nwhen\npartitioned as a + b: Fa (B, B\u0303) =\nqpthe system is\np\nTr\n\u03c1a (B)\u03c1a (B\u0303) \u03c1a (B). F characterizes the degree\nof change of the state as the field is varied. For our\npurposes, it is sufficient to consider the subsystem a to\nconsist of just the l-th spin[12]. Within the critical region, Fl is unit everywhere except for a series of discrete\nand sharp drops at the crossing points B = Bk . For\nlarge system sizes, when the crossings are dense in the\ninterval |B| \u2264 1, we can perform a coarse-graining and\nevaluate F only at these points. As a result of this procedure, only the drop at B = 1 remains, while all of the\nintermediate ones are smeared out, see Fig. 1(c). Interestingly enough, this behavior occurs only for bulk spins.\nIf, instead, one of the end spins is singled out, the coarse\ngrained fidelity stays flat.\nAn even more direct evidence that for large N the\nstate of the bulk spins changes essentially in a continuous way except for the critical point B = 1, is obtained by looking at the fidelity susceptibility[12]: \u03c7lF =\nlim\u03b4B\u21920 \u22122 ln Fl /(\u03b4B)2 , plotted for a bulk spin in Fig.1\n(b). This behavior appears related to the essential singularity shown by the block entropy at B = 1 [13].\n\nINFINITE SPIN CHAIN\n\nFor N \u2192 \u221e, the intervals Bk+1 < B < Bk become\ninfinitesimally small and \u03c9 \u2261 (\u03c0k)/(N + 1) becomes continuous, \u03c9 \u2248 arccos(B), so that the sum in (3) gives an\nenergy per spin\ni\n\u03c0\u0011 p\n2h \u0010\n\u01ebg (B)\nB arccos B \u2212\n\u2212 1 \u2212 B 2 , (7)\n=\nN \u2192\u221e\nN\n\u03c0\n2\nlim\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nEnergy\n\nConcurrence\n0.4\n\n-0.6\n\n0.3\n-0.7\n\n0.2\n-0.8\n\n0.1\n\n-0.9\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nB\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nB\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) (a) The ground state energy per spin\n(black curve) against the magnetic field B in the thermodynamic limit. The energy for N = 20 is also plotted, together with the intersections of the eigenvalues occurring at\nthe crossing points Bk = cos[k\u03c0/(N + 1)] (vertical lines). (b)\nThermodynamic limit concurrence between two spins at distance r = 1 (blue), r = 2 (red), r = 3 (yellow), r = 4 (green)\nand r = 5 (cobalt). Entanglement between any two spins\ndecreases as the distance between the spins increases. It is\nnotable that all the parameters in the figures are dimensionless.\n\nwhich is analytic everywhere within the critical region,\nexcept for B = \u00b11. From the finite size analysis, however, we know that such region consists of dense set of\ncrossings points (see Fig. 2 (a)) and therefore can be\nconsidered as a line of continuous QPT, with the ground\nstate driven by B through various symmetric spin subspaces with k \u2248 (N + 1)(arccos B)/\u03c0 flipped spins. The\ncorrelation functions behave differently for spins close to\nthe chain boundaries and for bulk spins. Setting the distance r = m \u2212 l, the limit N \u2192 \u221e leads to different\n\u03b1\nbehaviors of h\u03c3l\u03b1 \u03c3l+r\ni depending on whether l \u226b r (bulk\nspins) or l \u226a r (end point spins), [14]. In particular, for\nz\nB = 0 (\u03c9 = \u03c0/2), h\u03c3lz \u03c3l+r\ni = (1/r2 )(l + r)2 /(l + r/2)2 ,\nwith a long distance behavior independent of boundary\nconditions. In contrast, longitudinal correlations are sensitive to the boundary\n\u221a 2 \u22121/2\n\u001a\nl\u226br\n2\u00c3\u221ar\nx\nh\u03c3lx \u03c3l+r\ni=\n(8)\n2 \u22123/4\n4K( l+1\n2)\n\u00c3\nr\nl\n\u226ar\n)(\n2\nwhere \u00c3 = 0.6450025 and K(x) is a function given in[14].\nFor N \u2192 \u221e, we find gl,l+r \u2243 2/\u03c0[sin \u03c9r/r \u2212 sin \u03c9(2l +\nx\nr)/(2l + r)], so that, for bulk spins at B = 0, h\u03c3lx \u03c3l+r\ni=\n\u0011\n\u0010\nr\u22122j\n\u0001\nQ\n2\nr\n[r/2]\u22121\n4j\n2\nwhere [x] is the closest integer\nj=1\n\u03c0\n4j 2 \u22121\n\nz\nlarger than x, and h\u03c3lz \u03c3l+r\ni = [1 \u2212 (\u22121)r ] \u03c0(\u22122)\n2 r 2 , which\nagrees with [15].\nThe concurrence Cl,l+r can be derived from the above\ncorrelation functions. We find that liml\u2192\u221e Cl,l+r disappears for r \u2265 2. Only two nearest spins are entangled, with liml\u2192\u221e Cl,l+1 = 0.339 at B = 0[16]. Bulk\nconcurrence liml\u2192\u221e Cl,l+r between two spins at distance\n1 \u2264 r \u2264 5 is plotted for various values of B in Fig. 2\n(b), where the decay of entanglement with the distance\nis also shown. For nearest neighboring spins, the concurrence goes \u223c 1/B, disappearing at B = 1. Near this\npoint, bipartite entanglement appears for every r and any\n\n\f4\ntwo spins in the chain become entangled, although the\nmagnitudes become smaller and smaller with r. This is\nbecause B = 1 is the factorizing point for the XX model,\nwith diverging entanglement range [17]. The one-tangle\nliml\u2192\u221e \u03c4l behaves in a similar way.\n\nDISCUSSIONS\n\nIn this section we show how the ground state instability and the edge entanglement are strictly related to\nthe emergence of quasi long range order. It is convenient Q\nto employ a dual basis to describe the system:\nx\n. Once applied to a fully polarized state,\n\u03bcn = m\u2264n \u03c3m\n\u03bcn creates a topological excitation (a kink)[6, 18]. Indeed, any state with k spin flips (i.e., after k crossings)\ncan be viewed as suitable combination of k kink-antikink\npairs. When B > 1, there are no kinks and the state is\nseparable. Near the critical point, with B = 1 \u2212 \u01eb, the\nground state consists of a superposition of states with\na single spin-flip, or a sea of condensed kink-antikink\npairs (of infinite length for N \u2192 \u221e); such a condensation gives rise to the divergence of the concurrence\nrange. By decreasing B, the size of the kink-antikink\npairs decreases and their number increases. At B = 0,\nthe ground state has a single (degenerate) kink, with half\nof the spins pointing down and half pointing up. The\nstate is 'highly' symmetric and every spin is maximally\nentangled with the rest of the chain, but bipartite entanglement is present with the nearest neighbor only. This\nis due to the fact that the concurrence depends (and it\nis always smaller than) the longitudinal correlation function, which ultimately tends to zero because of the presence of the kinks. Indeed, with quasi-long range order\n(which arises because the spinwaves are massless), the\nlong range correlation function decays since the kinks are\nheavy. The critical region is an instability line because\nthe system is driven through different Hilbert space sectors labelled by different quantumP\nnumbers (the eigenvalues of the total magnetization i \u03c3iz ) with different\nnumber of kinks-antikinks pairs. At finite size the phenomenon of switching among states with a different number of kinks is witnessed by the sequence of jumps in the\nentanglement, which are smeared out for N \u2192 \u221e, except\nat |B| = 1 as evidenced by the partial state fidelity.\nKinks are essentially bulk excitations and the picture\nabove is modified near the boundaries. Indeed, surface\nspins share entanglement differently from bulk ones: for\nsmall magnetic fields, every spin is highly entangled with\nthe rest, but the end-spins participate essentially to bipartite entanglement, while the bulk ones are rather involved in multi-partite correlations. On the other hand,\nnear |B| = 1, surface spins are less entangled than those\nat the center (indeed, the first jumps of \u03c41 and C1,2\nare smaller than the corresponding ones for bulk spins).\nThus, end spins are less sensitive to the onset of the crit-\n\nical region (as shown also by the fidelity), while they are\nmore entangled when the quasi long range order is fully\nestablished. This peculiar edge entanglement is reminiscent of the solitonic edge states found in [4] and could\nconstitute a fingerprint for topological order in one dimension, valid beyond our specific model. Finally we\nnote that preliminary analysis have shown that the formalism we have developed opens the way for the understanding the role of cluster type states [19] close to QPT,\nespecially for quantum information purposes. Indeed, a\nHamiltonian for the cluster state can be mapped onto\na model with Ising order by means of the dual transformations employed above. This provides a non-trivial\ndisentangling protocol for the cluster states [20] that will\nbe explored in a subsequent work.\nSummarizing, through the study of the entanglement\ncontent and of the fidelity of the ground state, we have\ninvestigated the quasi long range order in the XX model\nand its connection to the quantum instability arising at\nfinite size as a result of the presence of topological excitations. We have also discussed the special entanglement\nproperties of the edge spins arguing that they are a direct\nmanifestation of the topological character of the QPT.\nAcknowledgements- This work is supported by the National Research Foundation & Ministry of Education,\nSingapore.
