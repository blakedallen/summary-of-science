Conventional SU(5) GUT, even being the simplest model, was ruled out by severe\nexperimental limit on proton lifetime as well as its original SUSY version[1, 2](SGUT). This\nis due to the dimension 5 proton decay in the SU(5) SGUT model. However, in models with\nextra dimensions, there are new ways to prevent proton decay e.g. by assuming nontrivial\nboundary condition on extra-dimensional components of fields[3, 4]. Proton decay through\ndangerous dimension 5 operator could also be suppressed by the use of appropriate discrete\nsymmetries[5]. The leading contribution of proton decay is then of dimension 6 contact form\nbeing suppressed by the square of the mass scale. With these developments, SGUT SU(5) can\nbe modified to survive experimental limit on proton lifetime.\nFor SGUT SU(5) in intersecting-branes models, symmetry is more naturally broken by\ndiscrete Wilson lines[6]. This is different from symmetry breaking mechanism in conventional\n4-dimensional GUT. We achieve gauge couplings unification by extra dimensional unification\nand it does not correspond, in general, to 4 dimensional GUT. Threshold corrections in RGE in\nextra dimensional models contains extra contribution from massive Kaluza-Klein states. This\nbrings in dependence on geometrical factors, L(Q), as well as volume of compactified manifold,\nVQ . They play the role of MGU T in the running of gauge couplings[7]. In this sense, MGU T\ndoes not have any meaning in extra-dimensional unification but a parameter to keep track of\nunification expressed in 4 dimensional GUT language.\nIn this paper, we will first discuss results from ref. [8] on tree-level amplitudes in SUSY\nSU(5) intersecting-branes model and the possibility of getting limit on the upper bound of the\nstring scale in this D6-D6 model and proceed to discuss generic properties of quantum part\nof amplitudes in braneworld scenario in relation to number of twisted fields we introduce into\nthe models. Then we consider IR-correction to quantum part of amplitudes from classicalsolutions contribution of the path integral, i.e. instanton contribution. Quantum and classical\ncontributions are discussed separately in order to emphasize unique characteristics of each one\nof them. Phenomenology of braneworld scenario involves combination of effects from both local\nquantum behaviour and global classical contributions determined by compactification. In this\nway we can discuss some possibilities that give purely stringy low energy amplitudes which do\nnot have field theory correspondence. One example of such processes could be proton decay\n2\n\n\fas discussed in ref. [8]. Finally for comparison to \"top-down\" approach, we calculate proton\ndecay in \"bottom-up\" coincident branes model using certain choices of Chan-Paton factors to\nkinematically suppress the amplitude[9]. Estimated limit on lower bound of the string scale in\nthis case is remarkably high.\nII.\n\nIR-AMPLITUDES IN INTERSECTING-BRANES MODELS\n\nGenerically, branes with any dimensionalities can intersect or be coincident. There are a\nnumber of semi-realistic models of intersecting-branes with equal dimensionality[10] and therefore we will focus more on this case. For completeness, we will also comment on IR behaviour\nof intersecting-branes with different dimensionalities such as D3-D7 configuration. Finally we\nshow that in certain situations, IR limit of string amplitudes in intersecting-branes scenario\ncan be purely stringy with no standard model correspondence and they are automatically suppressed by the string scale.\nA.\n\nIntersecting-branes with Equal Dimensionality and Proton Decay\n\nAs in ref.[8], we will consider dimension-6 channel of proton decay assuming dimension-5\nchannel is suppressed by some means such as discrete symmetries[5]. In intersecting-branes\nmodel with particular SU(5)-group structure, leading contribution to proton decay is purely\nstringy [8]. This is a dimension-6 operator proportional to string coupling gs and \u03b1\u2032 = 1/MS2 .\nThe formula for quantum amplitude of processes such as p \u2192 \u03c0 0 e+\nL from ref. [8] is\ngs\nI(\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 )u \u03041 \u03b3 \u03bc u2 u \u03043 \u03b3\u03bc u4 T1234\n2\nMS\n\n(1)\n\n\u221a\n3\nY\ndx\nsin \u03c0\u03b8i\n,\n\u2032s\n\u2032t\n1+\u03b1\n1+\u03b1\n1/2\nx\n(1 \u2212 x)\ni=1 [F (\u03b8i , 1 \u2212 \u03b8i ; 1; x)F (\u03b8i , 1 \u2212 \u03b8i ; 1; 1 \u2212 x)]\n\n(2)\n\nA(1, 2, 3, 4) = i\u03c0\nwhere\nI(\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 ) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u03b8i are SU(3) parameters relating 3 complex coordinates representing transverse directions to\n1 + 3 dimensional intersection region and T1234 is corresponding Chan-Paton factor in SU(5).\nF (x) \u2261 F (\u03b8, 1\u2212\u03b8; 1, x) is hypergeometric function. Dependence on F (x) comes from correlation\nfunction of four bosonic twisted fields\n< \u03c3+ (0)\u03c3\u2212 (x)\u03c3+ (1)\u03c3\u2212 (\u221e) > \u223c\n3\n\n\u221a\n\nsin \u03c0\u03b8\n\n[x(1 \u2212 x)]\u22122\u2206\u03c3\n[F (x)F (1 \u2212 x)]1/2\n\n(3)\n\n\fwith \u2206\u03c3 = \u03b8(1 \u2212 \u03b8)/2.

This asymptotic behaviour determines convergency of x-integration in the s-channel limit.\nIn this setup, there is relationship between string parameters (gs , MS , L(Q)) and field theory\nGUT parameters (\u03b1GU T , MGU T ) as in Eq. (50) of [8],\ngs =\n\n\u03b1GU T L(Q)MS3\n3\n(2\u03c0)3 MGU\nT\n\n(5)\n\nwhere L(Q) = 4q sin2 (5\u03c0w/q), Ray-Singer torsion, contains information on geometry of the\ncompactified 3-manifold Q = S 3 /Zq [7, 8]. This relationship relates gs to MS through numerical\nvalues of 4 dimensional \u03b1GU T , MGU T . Substitute this into Eq. (1), we have\nAstring = i\n\n\u03b1GU T MS\n(L(Q)IT1234 )u \u03041\u03b3 \u03bc u2 u \u03043 \u03b3 \u03bc u4\n3\n2(2\u03c0)2 MGU\nT\n\n(6)\n\nI(s, t \u2192 0) is in [7, 11.5] range, L(Q) ranges from less than 1 to about order of 10. With\nminimal choice that produces standard model gauges, L(Q) = 8[8]. Using numerical values of\n4-dimensional SU(5) SGUT(i.e. unification condition), \u03b1GU T \u2243 0.04, MGU T \u2243 2 \u00d7 1016 GeV\nleading to proton lifetime \u03c4GU T \u2243 1.6 \u00d7 1036 years[2], and experimental limit on proton lifetime,\n\n\u03c4 > 4.4 \u00d7 1033 years[11], we have inequality\n\n2\n\n4.4\n>\n\u00d7 10\u22123\n1.6\n\n(7)\n\nMS < 118MGU T \u2243 2.4 \u00d7 1018 GeV\n\n(8)\n\nAGU T\n\u03c4string\n=\n\u03c4GU T\nAstring\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nleading to\n\nwhere we have approximated I \u2243 10.\nThere is also constraint from perturbative condition, gs < 1, using again Eq. (5) with\nsame set of numerical values, we have MS < 9.2MGU T \u2243 1.8 \u00d7 1017 GeV. Grand unification\nand perturbative conditions together put limit on upper bound of string scale above which\nperturbative viewpoint breaks down. Any SGUT(with D6-D6 configuration) string theories\nwith larger MS would have to interact strongly and we need to consider proton decay in dual\npictures. The value of the upper bound of string scale, (8), is outside the perturbative constraint\n4\n\n\fand therefore it is unfortunately inconclusive. However, it is interesting that this upper limit\non string scale does exist only in this D6-D6 model, if we have sufficiently more severe bound\non proton decay in the future experiments, it would lead inevitably to limit on the upper bound\nof the string scale.\nAn important aspect of this low-energy amplitude is the fact that it does not contain any\n1/s(Mandelstam's variable) pole like in conventional field theory amplitudes. Rather it is\nproportional to gs /MS2 , we interpret this as a purely stringy effect which appears as contact\ninteraction in field theory. The advantage is it can suppress proton decay amplitude to be of\nthe order of the string scale and therefore smallness is explained without the need of massive\nbosons exchange of the order of SGUT scale. Remarkably, experimental limit on proton lifetime\nresults in limit on UPPER bound of string scale in contrast to conventional SGUT cases where\nlimit on lower bound of X, Y bosons is derived. Grand unification requirement in SGUT SU(5)\nD6-D6 model relates string coupling to string scale and as a consequence, put limit on upper\nbound of the string scale.\nThis result can be understood to be originated from difference between \"top-down\" and\n\"bottom-up\" approaches to string theory. In top-down approach, we start with string parameters (gs , MS ) and geometrical details of compactification and we try to derive low energy\nparameters such as gY M , g1, g2, g3, Yukawa coupling, mixing angles and so on. With unification\nassumption, gs is tied to MS and geometrical factors and not a free parameter in the model. Experimental constraint from proton decay then results in upper bound on MS . On the contrary,\nfocussing mainly on kinematic extension of field-theory amplitudes to contain string resonances\neffect, bottom-up[9, 12, 13, 14, 15] approach simply fixes gs = gY2 M . Without assuming unification, there is no particular relationship between gs and MS . This, in a traditional way, finally\nprovides lower bound on the string scale when subject to experimental constraints[13, 15].\nOn the other hand, there seems to be disadvantage considering the need to have 1/s IRdivergence in order to reproduce field theory results at low energy[15]. We need the correct IR limit of string amplitudes which contain the 0th mode pole as gauge boson exchange.\nIntersecting-branes amplitudes actually provide 1/s pole in IR limit when we consider only\none complex coordinate and one twisted field contribution together with classical contribution\nfrom two branes wrapping the same torus T 2 [16, 17]. Difference from the present case is due to\ndiffering number of twisted fields in the quantum part of the amplitude and the classical con-\n\n5\n\n\ftribution of string winding modes which we will see later. There are 3 sets of twisted-field(from\n3 complex coordinates) correlation function, Eq. (3), in the D6-D6 intersecting-branes model\nwe are considering and they provide kinematic IR-regularisation to the amplitude[8]. We can\nfind critical number of twisted-field correlation functions above which IR divergence will be\nregularised by considering low energy expression for kinematic part of quantum amplitude\ncontaining l twisted fields\nZ\n\ndx\n2\u2212l\n(\u2212 ln x)\u2212l/2 =\n(\u2212 ln x)1\u2212l/2 |a0 for l 6= 2\nx\n2\n= \u2212\u221e for l = 2\n\na\n\n0\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nwhere a \u01eb (0, 1) is some small number, l is number of correlation functions of twisted fields. This\nis the same as Eq. (22) in [8] when generalised to l twisted fields. The integration converges\nwhen l \u2265 3 and therefore critical number of twisted fields is 3. At least 3 twisted fields are\nrequired to regulate IR behaviour and this implies that we need to twist boundary condition\nof string in 3 complex coordinates of the model. This is the case with D6-D6 setup.\nUsing analytic continuation from negative s to s \u2265 0 like in usual Veneziano amplitude, we\n\nget some information on how the poles look like at s = 0 and consequently at s = nMS2 .\nZ\n\n0\n\na\n\ndx\n\n(\u2212 ln x)\u2212l/2\n=\nx\u03b1\u2032 s+1\n=\n\nwhere incomplete Gamma function \u0393(x, y) \u2261\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2032\n\ndu u\u2212l/2 e\u03b1 su\n\n(11)\n\n\u0393(1 \u2212 2l , \u2212s ln a) \u2032 l/2\u22121\n(\u03b1 )\ns1\u2212l/2\n\n(12)\n\n\u2212 ln a\n\nR\u221e\ny\n\ne\u2212u ux\u22121dx. Notably for l = 2, it gives \u223c (ln s)\n\npole as s \u2192 0. At l = 0, we have normal gauge boson exchange 1/s pole. For l > 0, twisted\nfields modify pole by power of l/2. At l \u2265 3, amplitude is regulated. Behaviour of all other\npoles at s = nMS2 for each value of l are given by analytic continuation from pole at s = 0 we\nhave here.\nIn Dp-Dp intersecting-branes(3 < p < 6) with 1+3 dimensional intersection region, we\nneed to change boundary condition of interbrane-attached string in p \u2212 3 complex dimensions.\nTherefore we need to introduce p \u2212 3 twisted fields into each vertex operator(NS sector). Since\nthe number of twisted fields is always less than 3, the amplitudes have IR divergences(not\nnecessarily corresponding to gauge boson exchange) given by Eq. (12). In D5-D5, since l = 5 \u2212\n3 = 2, quantum amplitude gives (ln s) divergence. In D4-D4, l = 1 and we thus have fractional\npole 1/s1/2 . In these models, we do not have purely stringy amplitudes, gs /MS2 , as leading\n6\n\n\forder as in D6-D6 case. However, from Eq. (12), there are string resonance terms analytically\ncontinued from s = 0 region. At low energy, these terms gs \u03b1\u2032l/2 /(s \u2212 nMS2 )1\u2212l/2 \u2243 gs /nMS2 .\n\nTherefore there could be gs /MS2 contact term in the amplitude regardless of the number of\ntwisted fields 3 > l > 0.\n\u22121/3\n\nAnother curious aspect of amplitudes in SGUT intersecting-branes models is the factor \u03b1GU T\n\nenhancement comparing to 4 dimensional GUT amplitudes[8]. We will see that this is the effect\nfrom compactification and it depends on how we achieve 1+3 world from 10 dimensional space.\nConsider the parameters relation, Eq. (5) could be generalized to Dp-Dp case,\ngs \u223c \u03b1GU T\n\nMSp\u22123\np\u22123\nMGU\nT\n\n!\n\n(13)\n\nignoring geometry factor. This leads to\n\uf8eb\n\n2/(p\u22123)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03b1\ngs\n\u223c gs1+2/(3\u2212p) \uf8ed GU2T \uf8f8\n2\nMS\nMGU T\n(5\u2212p)/(p\u22123)\n\nwhich has enhancement factor \u03b1GU T\n\n(14)\n\ncomparing to 4 dimensional GUT amplitude \u223c\n\n2\n\u03b1GU T /MGU\nT . Interestingly, this factor disappears at p = 5 along with dependence of amplitude\n\non gs . Since low energy limit of purely stringy part of tree-level amplitudes always appear as\ngs /Ms2 contact interaction form, we can conclude that stringy effect always appears with this\n(5\u2212p)/(p\u22123)\n\nenhancement(or dehancement) factor \u03b1GU T\n\n. We can interpret the factor as a result from\n\ncertain choice of compactification which gives our 1+3 dimensional matter universe. Projected\nonto 4 dimensional field theory, fractional power of coupling \u03b1GU T could as well be interpreted\nas \"non-perturbative\" characteristic of the amplitudes. Observe also that coincident-branes\nlimit p = 3 gives conventional \"bottom-up\" gs \u223c \u03b1GU T identification and relationship between\ngs and MS remarkably disappears. There is consistency between top-down and bottom-up\napproaches.\nB.\n\nIntersecting-branes with Different Dimensionalities\n\nWe can obtain 1 + 3 intersection region from other combinations of intersecting-branes with\ndiffering dimensionalities. An example of D3-D7 system has been calculated [18] and there is\nIR pole in the amplitude coming from instanton contributions cancelling effect of twisted fields\nas we will see later in section C. Here we will focus only on quantum part of the amplitude and\naccording to previous argument, we will show that IR behaviour is finite.\n7\n\n\fUsing again correlation function of four bosonic twisted fields, Eq. (3), we reach at the same\nEq. (10) as a check for IR behaviour of the amplitude. Since there are l = 4 twisted fields in a\nvertex operator in order to change four boundary conditions of D7 to D3 which is larger than\ncritical number of twisted fields (namely 3), therefore quantum part of four-fermion amplitude\nis finite and thus proportional to gs /MS2 in low energy limit(from Eq. (12)).\nC.\n\nClassical Contributions to String Amplitudes\n\nIn path integral calculation of string scattering amplitude, the action is divided into quantum\nand classical contributions and they are factorized from one another. Physically, quantum part\ndepends only on local behaviour of quantum theory while classical part contains information of\nglobal geometry which constrains classical solutions of the system. While classical contribution\nof path integral of field on sphere is constant and can be absorbed into string coupling(since\nthere is no winding modes), classical contribution of field on nontrivial compactified manifold\nlike torus contains various topological contributions from winding states. We need these information to be manifest in order to extract correct low energy behaviour of string scattering\namplitude.\nThe simplest nontrivial case in which classical contribution has been calculated is T 2 torus\nwith two branes wrapping specified by wrapping numbers (n1 , m1 ) and (n2 , m2 )[16, 17]. Following ref.[17], the classical contribution of the path integral is\n\"\n\nsin(\u03c0\u03b8) F (1 \u2212 x)\nF (x)\nexp \u2212\n(r1 L1 )2 +\n(r2 L2 )2\n\u2032\n2\u03c0\u03b1\nF\n(x)\nF\n(1\n\u2212\nx)\nr1 ,r2\nX\n\n#\n\n(15)\n\nIn the x \u2192 0 limit(s-channel limit), the exponential contribution from L1 lattice is zero except\nthe zero mode, r1 = 0 while the contribution from L2 lattice becomes constant for each r2 . With\nrespect to one r2 winding state, the contribution is just constant and low energy behaviour is\nthus governed totally by quantum part of the amplitude. This would be the case if the winding\nstates summation\n\nP\n\nr2\n\nis somehow truncated at finite terms.\n\nHowever, we can use Poisson resummation to make some low energy behaviour manifest\nwhich can be seen explicitly in the Poisson resummation formula.\ns\n\n1X\n\u03c0\n(16)\nexp(\u2212 m2 )\na m\na\nn\nThe pole at a = 0 arises on the left-handed side as an infinite sum of various instantons but not\nX\n\nexp(\u2212\u03c0an2 ) =\n\nbeing manifest in each term. The right-handed side manifests this pole as the volume factor\n8\n\n\fin the upfront. This pole becomes visible at low energy in this new \"vacuum\" choice after the\nPoisson resummation. This resummation leads to\nv\nu\nX u 2\u03c0 2 \u03b1\u2032 F (1 \u2212 x)\nt\n\nr1 ,m2\n\nF (1 \u2212 x) sin(\u03c0\u03b8)\n2\u03c0 3 \u03b1\u2032 m2 2\n2\nexp\n\u2212\n(r\nL\n)\n+\n( )\n1\n1\nL22 sin(\u03c0\u03b8)F (x)\nF (x)\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\nsin(\u03c0\u03b8) L2\n\"\n\n#\n\n(17)\n\nfor classical partition function. The exponential of F (1 \u2212 x)/F (x) reduces to power of x as\nx \u2192 0.\nF (1 \u2212 x)\nexp \u2212\n[...] \u223c\nF (x)\n\n\u03b4\nx\n\n!\u2212[...] sin(\u03c0\u03b8)/\u03c0\n\n(18)\n\nThis power of 1/x shift the 1/s pole as we can see from\n2\nsin(\u03c0\u03b8)\n2 MS\n= r1\n[...]\n\u03c0\nM12\n\n!\n\n+ \u03b1\u2032 (m2 M2 )2\n\n(19)\n\nwhere M12 = 2\u03c0 2 /L21 sin2 (\u03c0\u03b8), M22 = 2\u03c0 2 /L22 are corresponding KK masses. With respect to\nL2 , the resonances appear at s = (m2 M2 )2 . With respect to L1 , the resonances appear at\ns = r12 MS4 /M12 . These are the usual KK and winding corrections which are not unexpected.\nWe can see that in the instanton-decoupled limit MS \u226b Mc (Mc = 1/L1 or 1/L2 ), the r1 6= 0\ncontribution is very suppressed since the poles are at very high energies while the contribution\nfrom M2 resonances are at low energies and thus non-negligible. We can see that even each\nr2 winding state contribution is suppressed, the infinite sum of their contributions become\nsignificant at low energies. This is made manifest by Poisson resummation.\nNext we turn to the factor\n\nq\n\nF (1 \u2212 x)/F (x) in front of the exponential in Eq. (17), this\n\nis the leading order contribution to x-integration of the amplitude and consequently the part\nthat modifies effect of twisted fields to low energy physics. Using approximation in Eq. (4),\nthe factor gives (\u2212 ln(x))1/2 as x \u2192 0. This will modify the power of \u2212 ln(x) in Eq. (11) to\n(\u2212 ln(x))(1\u2212l)/2 . In other words, when there is one T 2 , we replace l by l \u2212 1, when there is two\n\ntori, T 2 \u00d7 T 2 , we replace by l \u2212 2 and so on. We see that this piece results in fractional power\nof 1/s, exotic kinematic effect which does not exist in field theory or KK models. In D6-D6\nmodel, we can assume two branes wrapping compactified space T 2 \u00d7 T 2 \u00d7 T 2 [17]. In this case,\neffects of twisted fields are completely compensated by these factors from classical contribution\nand we thus recover 1/s pole at low energy. Therefore, around the resonances, since x \u2243 0\nis dominant in the x-integration, the Veneziano form of the amplitude is naturally recovered\nin this choice of compactification. Note that this is not necessary and there are possibilities\n9\n\n\ffor exotic IR behaviour, i.e. gs /MS2 contact form or fractional power of 1/s(Eq. (12)), of total\namplitudes in other choices of compactification.\nThe rule is if we have two intersecting branes wrapping same n T 2 tori, we replace l by\nl \u2212 n in Eq. (12) to get leading order behaviour of 1/s pole. Complete cancellation occurs\nwhen l = n and we always retrieve 1/s gauge boson exchange contribution. In cases where\nl \u2212n > 2, we have IR finite amplitude and it is suppressed automatically by the string scale MS\nand effectively decouple at low energy. In model construction, instead of arbitrary intersection\nand compactification choices(modulo previously known conditions such as SUSY preservation or\nGUT which are a matter of preferences), we also have to consider this kinematic aspect of string\namplitudes. For low energy phenomenology purpose, since we do not observe exotic fractional\npowers of 1/s, therefore they should be eliminated by appropriate choices of compactification\ncorresponding to number of twisted fields we have when we setup branes intersection. At higher\nenergy, there is no reasons(so far) to prevent these terms, they are part of stringy effects unique\nin intersecting-branes models.\nNote also that after Poisson resummation, since the 1/s pole is recovered together with the\nfactor of M2 /MS for each T 2 ( from Eq. (17)), the argument on the limit of the upper bound\non the string scale from proton decay is no longer valid in this choice of compactification.\nOn the other hand, instead of interpreting low energy physics in terms of field theoretic\nresonances(i.e. x \u2192 0, 1 limits corresponding to s, t-channel exchanges), it is pointed out\nin ref. [16, 19, 20] that there exists purely stringy contribution(instanton contribution) when\ncontribution around saddle point of classical action is dominant in the x-integration. However\ncaution has to be made that this is the case only when quantum part of the amplitude is\nregulated(no singularity along x-integration). If there is IR divergence from quantum part, it\nmeans the contribution from pole at x = 0(1) is dominant and saddle-point approximation\nceases to be valid. In the case that the quantum part is regulated, we can conclude from\nthe previous section that leading order must be of contact form, gs /MS2 , now multiplying with\nexponential suppression from area of the worldsheet instanton. As expected, even in this saddlepoint approximation, the instanton effect is multiplied by gs /MS2 and thus suppressed by the\nstring scale.\n\n10\n\n\fIII. LIMIT ON LOWER BOUND OF STRING SCALE IN BOTTOM-UP APPROACH FROM PROTON DECAY\n\nIn \"bottom-up\" coincident-branes model[13, 14, 15], we do not have effect of twisted fields\nin the picture, all fermions and gauge fields are identified with open string living on the same\nstack of branes with unspecified number of branes. Assuming some unification group which\nhave leptons and quarks in the same multiplet( in order to induce proton decay), we can\nidentify each particle with appropriate Chan-Paton matrix. Tree-level amplitude for 4 fermions\nis generically[13, 15, 21]\nAstring = igs [A(s, t)S(s, t)T1234 + A(t, u)S(t, u)T1324 + A(u, s)S(u, s)T1243 ]\n\n(20)\n\nwhere A(x, y) is kinematic part of SU(n) amplitude[13, 22],\nS(x, y) =\n\n\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 x)\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 y)\n,\n\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 x \u2212 \u03b1\u2032 y)\n\n(21)\n\nthe usual part of Veneziano amplitude with the 0th pole excluded( put into A(x, y) part explicitly). Chan-Paton factors Tijkl = tr(ti tj tk tl + reverse)( t's are Chan-Paton matrices) contains\ninformation of gauge group, mixing and so on of external particles. To be more specific, we\nconsider uL dR \u2192 \u016bR e+\nL process of proton decay like in intersecting-branes case. Proton decay\namplitude is extremely small( if not 0) and therefore we match string amplitude with 0 at low\nenergy. Following ref. [15]\nAstring (fL fR \u2192 fR fL ) = igs\n\n\"\n\nu\nu\nu2\nT1234 S(s, t) + T1324 S(t, u) + T1243 S(u, s)\nst\nt\ns\n\n#\n\n\u2243 0\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nwhere s, t, u are conventional Mandelstam variables. At low energy, S(x, y) \u2192 1 and since\ns + t + u = 0, this leads to constraints on Chan-Paton factors, T1234 = T1324 = T1243 \u2261 T . Plug\nback into Eq. (22), retrieving the next non-vanishing term from S(x, y) \u2243 1 \u2212\nAstring = \u2212igs T\n\n\u03c0 2 u2\n)\n(\n2 MS4\n\n\u03c0 2 xy\n,\n6 MS4\n\n(24)\n\nLike in intersecting-branes case, we compare with AGU T and use experimental limit on proton\ndecay while setting T = 1( if T = 0, there is no tree-level stringy proton decay and no limit on\nthe string scale could be derived),\n\u03c4string\nAGU T\n=\n\u03c4GU T\nAstring\n\n2\n\n4 1 MS4 2\n4.4\n\u00d7 10\u22123\n= ( 4) 2( 2 ) >\n\u03c0 u MGU T\n1.6\n\u0012\n\n11\n\n\u0013\n\n(25)\n\n\fwhere we have identified gs = 4\u03c0\u03b1GU T .

Observe that this kind of kinematic suppression makes\nuse of worldsheet duality( i.e. s, t duality of Veneziano amplitude) to eliminate the contact\ninteraction term gs /MS2 (dimension-6 operator), leaving only dimension-8 operator, u2 /MS4 , as\nleading-order stringy correction which results in stringent limit on MS . This limit, however,\nignores the conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism which suppresses proton\ndecay by making the X and Y GUT bosons very massive. It actually reflects the limit of proton\ndecay from \"purely stringy\" effect which could exist if T 6= 0 in some specific embedding of the\nfermions in some unspecified open-string representation at higher energies.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nFirst we have discussed the possibility of getting limit on the upper bound of the string scale\nin D6-D6 intersecting-branes SU(5) SGUT setup as in ref. [8] from the experimental constraint\non the proton decay. The quantum part of the four-fermion tree-level amplitude in this case\nis of the contact form with gs /MS2 dependence due to the number of twisted-field correlations.\nWe commented on how different number of twisted-field correlations in different Dp-Dp setup\ncould lead to different IR behaviour of the quantum part of the amplitude.\n(5\u2212p)/(p\u22123)\n\nThen we discussed appearance of the enhancement( or dehancement) factor \u03b1GU T\n\nin\n\n2\nDp-Dp setup when we compare stringy contact term gs /MS2 to the \u03b1GU T /MGU\nT factor in 4\n\ndimensional GUT amplitude. This non-integer power of \u03b1GU T is natural from the viewpoint\nthat we \"project\" the extra-dimensional unification onto conventional 4 dimensional GUT RGE.\nIn non-trivial compactification such as T 2 , there are classical winding states contribution to\nthe amplitude. We explicitly demonstrated how Poisson resummation of the instanton contributions makes the classical instanton contribution to x \u2192 0 region manifest. In intersecting-branes\nscenario, there are contributions from both quantum and classical part to the x \u2192 0 region\nin the stringy amplitude, and we need both to obtain the usual gauge boson 1/s pole at low\nenergies.\nFinally we estimated the lower bound on the string scale in \"bottom-up\" coincident-branes\napproach using constraint on proton decay. The limit is derived solely from purely stringy( of\n12\n\n\fanother kind of purely stringy effect from the dimension 6 mentioned above) contribution when\nappropriate choice of Chan-Paton factors is chosen. Comparing to other constraints on the\nstring scale in the \"bottom-up\" approach [15], this lower bound is remarkably strong, about\n105 TeV.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe wish to thank Tao Han, Gary Shiu, and Fernando Marchesano for valuable discussions.\nThis work was supported in part by the U.S. Department of Energy under grant number DEFG02-95ER40896, and in part by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n\nP.
