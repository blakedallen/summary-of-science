We obtain two results concerning the Feichtinger conjecture for\nsystems of normalized reproducing kernels in the model subspace K\u0398 = H 2 \u2296\n\u0398H 2 of the Hardy space H 2 , where \u0398 is an inner function.

Secondly, we prove the Feichtinger conjecture in the\ncase where \u0398 is a one-component inner function, meaning that the set {z :\n|\u0398(z)| < \u03b5} is connected for some \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1).\n\n1. Introduction\nA sequence of unit vectors {hn } in a separable Hilbert space H is said to be a\nBessel sequence if, for some constant C > 0 and every h \u2208 H,\nX\n(1)\n|hh, hn iH |2 \u2264 Ckhk2H .\nn\n\nFurther, a sequence {hn } \u2282 H is called a Riesz basic sequence if it is a Riesz basis\nin its span, or equivalently, if there exists a constant A > 0 such that\nX\nX\nX\n2\n\u2264A\n|cn |2\ncn hn\n|cn |2 \u2264\nA\u22121\nn\n\nH\n\nn\n\nn\n\nfor any finite sequence {cn } \u2282 C.\nThe Feichtinger conjecture states that every Bessel sequence splits into finitely\nmany Riesz basic sequences.\nThe Feichtinger conjecture is a problem of high current interest. As recently\nshown in [7, 8, 9], it is equivalent to the famous Kadison\u2013Singer conjecture in\nC \u2217 -algebras and to some other important open problems in analysis.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 30D50, 30D55, 30E05, 46E22.\nKey words and phrases.

A natural class of examples is given by systems of (normalized)\nreproducing kernels in Hilbert spaces of analytic functions. Let H be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of analytic functions on some domain D, and let k\u03bb denote\nthe kernel function corresponding to a point \u03bb \u2208 D, so that f (\u03bb) = hf, k\u03bb iH for\neach f \u2208 H. The Bessel property (1) for a system of normalized reproducing\nkernels k\u03bbn /kk\u03bbn kH is equivalent to the Carleson-type embedding H \u2282 L2 (\u03bc) for\nthe discrete measure\nX\n\u03bc=\nkk\u03bbn k\u22122\nH \u03b4\u03bbn ,\nn\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03bbn is the unit point mass at \u03bbn . Carleson measures are well understood\nfor many classical spaces (e.g., for Hardy, Bergman and Bargmann\u2013Fock spaces),\nand then the validity of the Feichtinger conjecture follows from various known\nresults about sampling and interpolation in these spaces.\n\n2. Main results\nIn this paper we consider a class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces where\nthe problem is still open. Let H 2 denote the Hardy space of the unit disk D,\nequipped with the standard norm k * k2 = k * kL2 (m) , where m is normalized\nLebesgue measure on the unit circle T. The reproducing kernels are then the\nusual Cauchy kernels (1 \u2212 \u03bbz)\u22121 , and the Feichtinger conjecture is true. Indeed,\nP\nif \u03bc = n (1 \u2212 |\u03bbn |) \u03b4\u03bbn is a Carleson measure, then \u039b = {\u03bbn } is a finite union of\ninterpolating sequences, and each of these corresponds to a Riesz basic sequence\nof Cauchy kernels. However, the problem becomes nontrivial for model (or starinvariant) subspaces of H 2 , that is, for subspaces of the form\nK\u0398 = H 2 \u2296 \u0398H 2 ,\nwhere \u0398 is an inner function on the disk. These subspaces play a distinguished\nrole in operator theory (see, e.g., [19, 20]) and in operator-related complex analysis.\nThe reproducing kernel for K\u0398 corresponding to a point \u03bb \u2208 D is given by\nk\u03bb (z) =\n\n1 \u2212 \u0398(\u03bb)\u0398(z)\n.\n1 \u2212 \u03bbz\n\n\fTHE FEICHTINGER CONJECTURE FOR REPRODUCING KERNELS\n\n3\n\nSince functions in K\u0398 have more analyticity than general H 2 functions, there\nmay exist reproducing kernels at boundary points (see Section 3 for details). We\nshall denote the normalized kernel k\u03bb /kk\u03bbk by k\u0303\u03bb .\nThe geometry of reproducing kernels in model subspaces seems to be highly\nnontrivial. No complete description is known either for Bessel sequences or for\nRiesz bases, which makes the Feichtinger conjecture for these spaces a difficult\nproblem. The problem of describing the Carleson measures for K\u0398 was posed\nby Cohn in 1982 and is still open, even though a number of partial results are\navailable [2, 3, 11, 13, 14, 15, 21]. One special case where the Carleson measures\nfor K\u0398 have been completely characterized is that of a one-component inner\nfunction \u0398. Here, by saying that \u0398 is one-component we mean that the set\n{z \u2208 D : |\u0398(z)| < \u03b5} is connected for some \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1).\nThe Riesz bases and Riesz basic sequences of reproducing kernels in K\u0398 were\ndescribed by Hruscev, Nikol'skii and Pavlov (see [18] and also [20, Part D, Chapter\n4]) under the additional hypothesis that the sequence \u039b = {\u03bbn } be close to the\nspectrum \u03c1(\u0398) of \u0398, in the sense that\n(2)\n\nsup |\u0398(\u03bbn )| < 1.\nn\n\nRecall that the spectrum \u03c1(\u0398) of an inner function \u0398 is, by definition, the smallest\nclosed subset of D \u222a T containing the zeros of \u0398 and the support of the associated\nsingular measure. Equivalently, \u03c1(\u0398) is the set of all points \u03b6 \u2208 D \u222a T such that\nlim inf |\u0398(z)| = 0.\nz\u2192\u03b6, z\u2208D\n\nTo summarize the Hruscev\u2013Nikol'skii\u2013Pavlov results, suppose that \u039b = {\u03bbn }\nobeys (2) and let B\u039b be the Blaschke product with zero sequence \u039b. Then {k\u0303\u03bbn }\nis a Riesz basis in K\u0398 if and only if \u039b satisfies the Carleson condition\n(C)\n\n\u03b4(B\u039b ) := inf\nn\n\nY\n\nk: k6=n\n\n\u03bbn \u2212 \u03bbk\n>0\n1 \u2212 \u03bbk \u03bbn\n\n(i.e., \u039b is an interpolating sequence) and the Toeplitz operator T\u0398B\u039b is invertible\n(this can be further rephrased by invoking the Devinatz\u2013Widom invertibility criterion; see, e.g., [18, p. 234]). Similarly, {k\u0303\u03bbn } is a Riesz basic sequence if and\nonly if \u039b satisfies (C) and T\u0398B\u039b is left-invertible; the latter condition is equivalent\nto dist(\u0398B \u039b , H \u221e ) < 1.\n\n\f4\n\nANTON BARANOV & KONSTANTIN DYAKONOV\n\nWe are now in a position to state our main results. The first of these applies to a\ngeneral inner function \u0398, provided that the Hruscev\u2013Nikol'skii\u2013Pavlov condition\n(2) is fulfilled. The underlying Hilbert space is, of course, always taken to be K\u0398 .\nTheorem 2.1. Every Bessel sequence of normalized reproducing kernels {k\u0303\u03bbn }\nwith property (2) splits into finitely many Riesz basic sequences.\nThe second theorem treats the case of a one-component inner function.\nTheorem 2.2. Assume that \u0398 is a one-component inner function. Then every\nBessel sequence of normalized reproducing kernels {k\u0303\u03bbn } splits into finitely many\nRiesz basic sequences.\nWe shall arrive at Theorem 2.2 by combining Theorem 2.1 with some stability\nresults (essentially due to Cohn) for Riesz bases of reproducing kernels.\nIt should be noted that our results carry over, via a unitary transform, to model\nsubspaces of the Hardy space H 2 (C+ ) in the upper half-plane C+ . In this case, the\npremier example of a one-component inner function is given by \u0398a (z) := exp(iaz),\na > 0, and K\u0398a essentially reduces to the Paley\u2013Wiener space P Wa . Precisely\nspeaking, if P Wa stands for the set of entire functions of exponential type at most\na that are square integrable on R, then\nK\u0398a = P Wa \u2229 H 2 (C+ ) = eiaz/2 P Wa/2 ,\nand we conclude that the Feichtinger conjecture holds for reproducing kernels in\nP Wa . This statement follows also from Theorem 2.1, since the sequence {\u03bbn }\ngenerates a Riesz sequence of normalized kernels in P Wa if and only if the same\nis true for the sequence {\u03bbn + i} (which satisfies (2) when \u03bbn \u2208 C+ \u222a R).\nRecall that the Fourier transform identifies P Wa with L2 (\u2212a, a) and converts\nthe reproducing kernels k\u03bb into the exponentials e\u03bb (t) := exp(i\u03bbt) on the interval\n(\u2212a, a). Thus, we have\nCorollary 2.3. The Feichtinger conjecture is true for any Bessel sequence of\nnormalized exponentials {e\u03bbn /ke\u03bbn k} in L2 (\u2212a, a).\nQuite recently, Yu. S. Belov, T. Y. Mengestie and K. Seip [6] have described\nthe Bessel sequences and proved the Feichtinger conjecture for a class of model\nsubspaces in H 2 (C+ ) generated by Blaschke products with very sparse zeros. Such\ninner functions are, of course, never one-component. Thus, our current results\nand those of [6] complement each other.\n\n\fTHE FEICHTINGER CONJECTURE FOR REPRODUCING KERNELS\n\n5\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we prove Theorem 2.1. Section 4 contains some preliminaries on Clark bases and a discussion\nof their stability. Finally, in Section 5, these results are applied to prove Theorem\n2.2.\nIn what follows, the letter C will stand for a positive constant, not necessarily\nthe same in different places. We write A \u224d B to mean that C \u22121 B \u2264 A \u2264 CB for\nsome constant C > 0.\n\n3. Proof of Theorem 2.1\nIt is known that the Bessel property for a system of normalized reproducing\nP\nkernels {k\u0303\u03bbn } always implies that the measure\nn (1 \u2212 |\u03bbn |) \u03b4\u03bbn is a Carleson\nmeasure (see [20, Part D, Lemma 4.4.2] or [4, Lemma 4.2]). This is especially\neasy to see when (2) is satisfied. Indeed, observe that\nkk\u03bbk22\n\n1 \u2212 |\u0398(\u03bb)|2\n,\n= k\u03bb (\u03bb) =\n1 \u2212 |\u03bb|2\n\n\u03bb \u2208 D.\n\nThen (2) implies that kk\u03bbn k22 \u224d (1 \u2212 |\u03bbn |2 )\u22121 and |k\u03bbm (\u03bbn )| \u224d |1 \u2212 \u03bbm \u03bbn |\u22121 .\nApplying the Bessel inequality\nX\n2\nf \u2208 K\u0398 ,\n(3)\n|f (\u03bbn )|2 kk\u03bbn k\u22122\n2 \u2264 Ckf k2 ,\nn\n\nto f = k\u03bbm , we deduce that\nsup\nm\n\nX (1 \u2212 |\u03bbm |2 )(1 \u2212 |\u03bbn |2 )\nn\n\n|1 \u2212 \u03bbm \u03bbn |2\n\n< \u221e.\n\nP\nThe latter condition means (cf. [19, p. 151]) that n (1 \u2212 |\u03bbn |) \u03b4\u03bbn is a Carleson\nmeasure, or equivalently (see [19, p. 158]), that \u039b is a finite union of interpolating\nsequences. Clearly, no generality will be lost in assuming that \u039b is a single\ninterpolating sequence.\nRecall that, for an interpolating sequence \u039b = {\u03bbn }, the constant of interpolation c(\u039b) is defined as the smallest constant c with the following property:\nwhenever {an } \u2282 C and supn |an | \u2264 1, there exists a function f \u2208 H \u221e with\nkf k\u221e \u2264 c that solves the interpolation problem f (\u03bbn ) = an (n = 1, 2, . . . ).\nRecall also that the interpolation constant c(\u039b) tends to 1 from above, as the\n\n\f6\n\nANTON BARANOV & KONSTANTIN DYAKONOV\n\nCarleson constant \u03b4 = \u03b4(B\u039b ) in (C) tends to 1 from below. More explicitly, an\nestimate due to Earl [16] reads\n(4)\n\n1 \u2264 c(\u039b) \u2264 \u03c6 (\u03b4(B\u039b )) ,\n\nwhere\n2 \u2212 \u03b4 2 + 2(1 \u2212 \u03b4 2 )1/2\n.\n\u03b42\nOur aim is to split \u039b, a given interpolating sequence, into finitely many (say\n\u221e\nN) subsequences \u039bj = {\u03bbjn }n=1 such that\n\u03c6(\u03b4) :=\n\n(5)\n\ndist (\u0398, Bj H \u221e ) < 1,\n\nj = 1, . . . , N,\n\nwhere Bj is the Blaschke product with zeros \u039bj . This done, we shall readily\nconclude (by the discussion in Section 2 above) that the kernels corresponding to\nthe points of \u039bj form a Riesz basic sequence, for each j. We shall thus arrive at\nthe sought-after partition.\nTo see how (5) can be achieved, note that\n\b\ndist (\u0398, Bj H \u221e ) = inf kf k\u221e : f \u2208 H \u221e , f |\u039bj = \u0398|\u039bj \u2264 \u03b3cj ,\n\nwhere \u03b3 := supn |\u0398(\u03bbn )| < 1 and cj := c(\u039bj ) is the interpolation constant for the\nsubsequence \u039bj . Therefore, it suffices to make sure that\n(6)\n\ncj < 1/\u03b3\n\nfor j = 1, . . . , N.\n\nUsing Earl's estimate (4) with \u039bj in place of \u039b, we see that (6) becomes true\n\u0001\nprovided that the Carleson constants \u03b4j := \u03b4 B\u039bj get close enough to 1, so as\nto ensure \u03c6(\u03b4j ) < 1/\u03b3. This in turn can be arranged via (a corollary of) Mills'\nfactorization lemma, as stated in [17, Chapter X, Corollary 1.6]. The lemma tells\nus that every interpolating Blaschke product B can be factored as B = B1 B2\nso that \u03b4(Bk ) \u2265 (\u03b4(B))1/2 , k = 1, 2. Applying the same procedure to each of\nthe factors that arise, and iterating this as many times as we need, we arrive at\nsubproducts Bj whose \u03b4j 's are as close to 1 as required.\n\u0003\n\n4. Clark bases and stability\nThere may exist Riesz bases of reproducing kernels which do not satisfy (2).\nAn important example is given by a Clark basis corresponding to points of T.\n\n\fTHE FEICHTINGER CONJECTURE FOR REPRODUCING KERNELS\n\n7\n\nLet us begin by recalling that, by Ahern and Clark's results [1], we have k\u03b6 \u2208\nK\u0398 for a point \u03b6 \u2208 T if and only if\nZ\nX 1 \u2212 |zn |2\nd\u03bd(\u03c4 )\n\u2032\n+2\n< \u221e.\n(7)\n|\u0398 (\u03b6)| =\n2\n|\u03b6 \u2212 zn |\n|\u03b6 \u2212 \u03c4 |2\nn\nT\n\nHere zn are the zeros of \u0398 and \u03bd is the associated singular measure.\nNow we turn to Clark's construction of orthogonal bases of reproducing kernels\n[10]. For each \u03b1 \u2208 T, the function (\u03b1 + \u0398)/(\u03b1 \u2212 \u0398) has positive real part in D.\nHence, there exists a finite (singular) positive measure \u03c3\u03b1 on T such that\nZ\n\u03b1 + \u0398(z)\n1 \u2212 |z|2\nRe\n=\nd\u03c3\u03b1 (\u03c4 ),\nz \u2208 D.\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u0398(z)\n|\u03c4 \u2212 z|2\nT\n\nP\nClark's theorem states that if \u03c3\u03b1 is purely atomic, i.e., if \u03c3\u03b1 = n an \u03b4\u03c4n , then\nthe system {k\u03c4n } is an orthogonal basis in K\u03982 ; in particular, k\u03c4n \u2208 K\u03982 . Note\nthat all measures \u03c3\u03b1 are purely atomic when the boundary spectrum \u03c1(\u0398) \u2229 T is\nat most countable.\nFor a one-component inner function \u0398, it was shown by Aleksandrov [2] that\nthe set \u03c1(\u0398) \u2229 T has zero Lebesgue measure, and moreover, \u03c3\u03b1 (\u03c1(\u0398) \u2229 T) = 0 for\nevery Clark measure \u03c3\u03b1 . Since T \\ \u03c1(\u0398) is a countable union of arcs where \u0398 is\nanalytic, each Clark measure is atomic and generates an orthogonal (Clark) basis\nof reproducing kernels k\u03c4n ; here {\u03c4n } is an enumeration of the level set\n{\u03c4 \u2208 T \\ \u03c1(\u0398) : \u0398(\u03c4 ) = \u03b1}.\nNote that \u0398 has an increasing smooth branch of the argument on each arc of\nT \\ \u03c1(\u0398). Furthermore, the change of argument of \u0398 between two neighboring\npoints \u03c4n and \u03c4n+1 equals 2\u03c0. That is,\nZ\nZ\n\u0398\u2032 (\u03c4 )\n1\n\u2032\nd\u03c4 = 1,\n|\u0398 (\u03c4 )|dm(\u03c4 ) =\n2\u03c0i (\u03c4n ,\u03c4n+1 ) \u0398(\u03c4 )\n(\u03c4n ,\u03c4n+1 )\nwhere (\u03c4n , \u03c4n+1 ) is the corresponding arc on T and m is normalized Lebesgue\nmeasure on T.\nWe shall need the following estimate due to Aleksandrov [2]: if \u0398 is a onecomponent inner function, then there exists a positive constant C = C(\u0398) such\nthat\n1 \u2212 \u0398(z)\u0398(\u03c4 )\n\u2264C\n(\u03c4 \u2212 z) * \u0398\u2032 (\u03c4 )\n\n\f8\n\nANTON BARANOV & KONSTANTIN DYAKONOV\n\nfor all z \u2208 D and \u03c4 \u2208 T \\ \u03c1(\u0398). Since lim inf |\u0398(z)| = 0 for \u03b6 \u2208 \u03c1(\u0398), this implies\nz\u2192\u03b6, z\u2208D\n\n|\u0398\u2032 (\u03c4 )|\u22121 \u2264 Cdist (\u03c4, \u03c1(\u0398)).\nR\nWe see, in particular, that J |\u0398\u2032 (\u03c4 )| dm(\u03c4 ) = \u221e for every connected component\nJ of T \\ \u03c1(\u0398), unless \u0398 is a finite Blaschke product.\nAn interesting result about stability of Clark bases for one-component functions\nwas obtained by Cohn [12, Theorem 3]. It says that {k\u0303\u03bbn } will be a Riesz basis\nin K\u0398 provided that {\u03bbn } is close to the support {\u03c4n } of a Clark basis, in the\nsense that the variation of \u0398 between \u03c4n and \u03bbn is small.\n\n(8)\n\nTheorem 4.1. Suppose \u0398 is a one-component inner function, {k\u03c4n } is a Clark\nbasis in K\u0398 , and \u03bbn \u2208 D \u222a T. Then there is an \u03b5 = \u03b5(\u0398) > 0 with the property\nthat {k\u0303\u03bbn } is a Riesz basis in K\u0398 whenever there exist paths (\u03c4n , \u03bbn ) connecting\n\u03c4n and \u03bbn for which\nZ\n|\u0398\u2032 (\u03c4 )| |d\u03c4 | < \u03b5.\n\nsup\nn\n\n(\u03c4n ,\u03bbn )\n\nThis will be an important ingredient in our proof of Theorem 2.2. In fact, we\nshall use the following slight modification of Theorem 4.1, which is a particular\ncase of [4, Corollary 1.3].\nTheorem 4.2. Let \u0398 be a one-component inner function. Then there exists an\n\u03b5 = \u03b5(\u0398) > 0 making the following statement true: if {k\u03c4n } is a Clark basis in\nK\u0398 and if \u03bbn are points of D \u222a T with\n|\u03bbn \u2212 \u03c4n | < \u03b5|\u0398\u2032 (\u03c4n )|\u22121 ,\nthen {k\u0303\u03bbn } is a Riesz basis in K\u0398 .\nIt should be emphasized that these results depend heavily on properties of onecomponent inner functions and fail in the general case; see [4] for counterexamples\nand for an extension that holds for generic inner functions.\n\n5. Proof of Theorem 2.2\nThroughout this section, \u0398 is a one-component inner function and {k\u0303\u03bbn : \u03bbn \u2208\n\u039b} is a Bessel sequence in K\u0398 . The idea of the proof is to split \u039b into two\nsequences, one of which is contained in the sublevel set {|\u0398| < \u03b4} for some \u03b4 < 1,\nwhile the other is a small perturbation of certain Clark measures' supports. We\n\n\fTHE FEICHTINGER CONJECTURE FOR REPRODUCING KERNELS\n\n9\n\nshall use a special system of arcs and Carleson squares that was introduced in [5],\nwhere compactness and Schatten class properties of the embeddings K\u0398 \u2282 L2 (\u03bc)\nwere studied.\nGiven a large positive integer N, we define the (countable) sets Tl with l =\n1, . . . , N by\n\b\nl\nTl = {\u03c4m\n} = \u03c4 \u2208 T \\ \u03c1(\u0398) : \u0398(\u03c4 ) = e2\u03c0il/N .\nEach Tl corresponds to a Clark basis. We also consider the set {\u03b6n } =\n\nN\nS\n\nTl .\n\nl=1\n\nThen we have a partition of T \\ \u03c1(\u0398) into arcs Jn with mutually disjoint interiors,\nwhose endpoints are in the set {\u03b6n } (we always assume that \u03b6n is the first endpoint\nof Jn when moving clockwise) and which satisfy\nZ\n|\u0398\u2032 (\u03c4 )| dm(\u03c4 ) = 1/N.\n(9)\nJn\n\nLemma 5.1.

In particular,\n(10)\n\n|Jn | \u224d N \u22121 |\u0398\u2032 (\u03b6n )|\u22121 ,\n\nwhere |Jn | denotes the length of the arc Jn .\nProof. By (9), |Jn | = 2\u03c0N \u22121 |\u0398\u2032 (\u03c4 )|\u22121 for some \u03c4 \u2208 Jn . It follows then from (8)\nthat, for N suitably large,\n|Jn | \u2264 Cdist (\u03c4, \u03c1(\u0398))/N < dist (\u03c4, \u03c1(\u0398))/10,\nso that the length of the arc is much smaller than the distance to the spectrum.\nA trivial estimate based on formula (7) gives us |\u0398\u2032(\u03b6)| \u224d |\u0398\u2032 (\u03c4 )| for \u03b6 \u2208 Jn (with\nan absolute constant), and (10) follows.\n\u0003\nWith each arc Jn we associate the Carleson square\nSn := {r\u03b6 : \u03b6 \u2208 Jn , 1 \u2212 |Jn |/2\u03c0 \u2264 r \u2264 1},\nand we put\nG := D \\\n\n[\nn\n\nSn .\n\n\f10\n\nANTON BARANOV & KONSTANTIN DYAKONOV\n\nl\nFurther, for a fixed l, we write Jm\n(m = 1, 2, . . . ) to enumerate those arcs among\nthe Jn 's whose first endpoint (when moving clockwise) is in Tl , and we denote\nl\nthe corresponding Carleson squares by Sm\n.\n\u22121\n\u2032\nObviously, diam Sn \u224d |Jn | \u224d N |\u0398 (\u03b6n )|\u22121 . Theorem 4.2 therefore implies the\nfollowing\n\nCorollary 5.2. If N is sufficiently large and l is any fixed index in {1, . . . , N},\nthen {k\u0303\u03bbm : m = 1, 2, . . . } is a Riesz basis in K\u0398 whenever {\u03bbm } is a sequence\nl\nwith \u03bbm \u2208 Sm\n.\nFrom now on, we fix some value of N = N(\u0398) that makes the conclusions of\nLemma 5.1 and Corollary 5.2 true. Our next step is to prove the following lemma.\nLemma 5.3. There exists a \u03b4 = \u03b4(\u0398), 0 < \u03b4 < 1, such that |\u0398(z)| < \u03b4 for all\nz \u2208 G.\nProof. Let \u03b6 \u2208 T \\ \u03c1(\u0398) and let z \u2208 D be a point with\n(11)\n\n|z \u2212 \u03b6| < dist (\u03b6, \u03c1(\u0398))/2.\n\nAn elementary estimate then yields\n(12)\n\nlog |\u0398(z)| \u2264 \u2212C(1 \u2212 |z|)|\u0398\u2032 (\u03b6)|\n\nwith an absolute constant C > 0 (see, e.g., the proof of Theorem 4.9 in [3]).\nConsider the boundary \u2202G of the domain G, and note that \u2202G \u2229 T = \u03c1(\u0398) \u2229 T.\nOur plan is to show that there exists a \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1) such that |\u0398(z)| \u2264 \u03b4 for each\nz \u2208 \u2202G \u2229 D. Since \u2202G is a rectifiable Jordan curve, |\u0398(z)| \u2264 1 in G, and \u2202G \u2229 T\nis of zero Lebesgue measure, the desired conclusion that |\u0398(z)| < \u03b4 for all z \u2208 G\nis then guaranteed by the maximum principle.\nNow suppose z \u2208 \u2202G \u2229 D. There are two possibilities: either, for some n,\nz = (1 \u2212 |Jn |/(2\u03c0)) \u03b6 with \u03b6 \u2208 Jn (i.e., z lies on the interior side of some square\nSn ) or there are two adjacent squares Sm and Sn with |Jm | \u2264 |Jn | such that\nz = r\u03b6, where\n1 \u2212 |Jn |/(2\u03c0) \u2264 r \u2264 1 \u2212 |Jm |/(2\u03c0)\nand \u03b6 is the common endpoint of Jm and Jn . Note that, by Lemma 5.1, |Jm | \u224d\n|Jn | \u224d N \u22121 |\u0398\u2032 (\u03b6)|\u22121. Thus, in any case,\n1 \u2212 |z| \u224d |Jn | \u224d N \u22121 |\u0398\u2032 (\u03b6)|\u22121,\nwith some absolute constants, while (11) holds true.\n\n\u03b6 = z/|z|,\n\n\fTHE FEICHTINGER CONJECTURE FOR REPRODUCING KERNELS\n\n11\n\nConsequently, (12) implies log |\u0398(z)| \u2264 \u2212C/N, and so |\u0398(z)| \u2264 e\u2212C/N =: \u03b4 on\n\u2202G \u2229 D.\n\u0003\nTo treat the points in \u039b\u2229\n\nS\n\nSm , we are going to show that, for a Bessel sequence\n\nm\n\n{k\u0303\u03bbn }, the number of \u03bbn 's in each of the squares is uniformly bounded.
