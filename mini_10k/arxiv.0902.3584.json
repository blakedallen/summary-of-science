[2, 3] for reviews. Recently [4], a quantum\nmodified Zakharov system was derived, by means of the quantum plasma hydrodynamic\nmodel [5]\u2013[7]. In this context, enhancement of the quantum effects was then shown e. g.\nto suppress the four-wave decay instability. Subsequently [8], a kinetic treatment of the\nquantum Zakharov system has shown that the modulational instability growth rate can be\nincreased in comparison to the classical case, for partially coherent Langmuir wave electric\nfields. Also [9], a variational formalism was obtained and used to study the radiation of\nlocalized structures described by the quantum Zakharov system. Bell shaped electric field\nenvelopes of electron plasma oscillations in dense quantum plasmas obeying Fermi statistics\nwere analyzed in Ref. [10]. More mathematically-oriented works on the quantum Zakharov\nequations concern its Lie symmetry group [11] and the derivation of exact solutions [12]\u2013[14].\nFinally, there is evidence of hyperchaos in the reduced temporal dynamics arising from the\nquantum Zakharov equations [15].\nAll these paper refer to quantum Zakharov equations in one-spatial-dimension only. In\nthe present work, we extend the quantum Zakharov system to fully three-dimensional space,\nallowing also for the magnetic field perturbation. In the classical case, both heuristic arguments and numerical simulations indicate that the ponderomotive force can produce finitetime collapse of Langmuir wave packets in two- or three-dimensions [2], [16, 17]. This is in\ncontrast to the one-dimensional case, whose solutions are smooth for all time. A dynamic\nrescaling method was used for the time-evolution of electrostatic self-similar and asymptotically self-similar solutions in two- and three-dimensions, respectively [18]. Allowing for\ntransverse fields shows that singular solutions of the resulting vector Zakharov equations\nare weakly anisotropic, for a large class of initial conditions [19]. The electrostatic nonlinear collapse of Langmuir wave packets in the ionospheric and laboratory plasmas has been\nobserved [20, 21]. Also, the collapse of Langmuir wave packets in beam plasma experiments\nverifies the basic concepts of strong Langmuir turbulence, as introduced by Zakharov [22].\nThe analysis of the coupled longitudinal and transverse modes in the classical strong Langmuir turbulence has been less studied [23]\u2013[25], as well as the intrinsically magnetized case\n[26], which can lead to upper-hybrid wave collapse [27]. Finally, Zakharov-like equations\n2\n\n\fhave been proposed for the electromagnetic wave collapse in a radiation background [28].\nIt is expected that the ponderomotive force causing the collapse of localized solutions\nin two- or three-space dimensions could be weakened by the inclusion of quantum effects,\nmaking the dynamics less violent. This conjecture is checked after establishing the quantum Zakharov system in higher-dimensional space and using its variational structure in\nassociation with a (Rayleigh-Ritz) trial function method.\nThe manuscript is organized in the following fashion. In Section 2, the quantum Zakharov\nsystem in three-spatial-dimensions is derived by means of the usual two-time scale method\napplied to the fully 3D quantum hydrodynamic model. In Section 3, the 3D quantum Zakharov system is shown to be described by a Lagrangian formalism. The basic conservation\nlaws are then also derived. When the density fluctuations are so slow in time so that an\nadiabatic approximation is possible, and treating the quantum term of the low-frequency\nequation as a perturbation, a quantum modified vector nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation for\nthe envelope electric field is obtained. In Section 4, the variational structure is used to analyze the temporal dynamics of localized (Gaussian) solutions of this quantum NLS equation,\nthrough the Rayleigh-Ritz method, in two-spatial-dimensions. Section 5 follows the same\nstrategy, extended to fully 3D space. Special attention is paid to the comparison between\nthe classical and quantum cases, with considerable qualitative and quantitative differences.\nSection 6 contains conclusions.\n\nII.\n\nQUANTUM ZAKHAROV EQUATIONS IN 3 + 1 DIMENSIONS\n\nThe starting point for the derivation of the electromagnetic quantum Zakharov equations\nis the quantum hydrodynamic model for an electron-ion plasma, Equations (20)-(28) of Ref.\n[7]. For the electron fluid pressure pe , consider the equation of state for spin 1/2 particles\nat zero temperature,\n5/3\n\n3 me vF2 e ne\n,\n(1)\n2/3\n5\nn0\nis the Fermi electron thermal speed, ne is the electron\n\npe =\nwhere me is the electron mass, vF e\n\nnumber density and n0 is the equilibrium particle number density both for electron and\nions. The pressure and quantum effects (due to their larger mass) are neglected for the ions.\nAlso due to the larger ion mass, it is possible to introduce a two-time scale decomposition,\nne = n0 + \u03b4ns + \u03b4nf , ni = n0 + \u03b4ns , ue = \u03b4us + \u03b4uf , ui = \u03b4us , E = \u03b4Es + \u03b4Ef , B = \u03b4Bf ,\n3\n\n\fwhere the subscripts s and f refer to slowly and rapidly changing quantities, respectively.\nAlso, ue is the electron fluid velocity, ni the ion number density, ui the ion fluid velocity, E\nthe electric field, and B the magnetic field. Notice that it is assumed that there is no slow\ncontribution to the magnetic field, a restriction which allows to get B = (me /e) \u2207 \u00d7 \u03b4uf (see\nEquation (2.21) of Ref. [3]), where \u2212e is the electron charge. Including a slow contribution\nto the magnetic field could be an important improvement, but this is outside the scope of\nthe present work.\nFollowing the usual approximations [3, 4], the quantum corrected 3D Zakharov equations\nread\n\u2202 \u1ebc\n\u2212 c2 \u2207 \u00d7 (\u2207 \u00d7 \u1ebc) + vF2 e \u2207(\u2207 * \u1ebc) =\n\u2202t\nh\ni\nh\u03042\n\u03b4ns 2\n2\n\u2207 \u2207 (\u2207 * \u1ebc) ,\n\u03c9 \u1ebc +\n=\nn0 pe\n4m2e\n\u2202 2 \u03b4ns\n\u03b50 2\nh\u03042\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212\nc\n\u2207\n\u03b4n\n\u2212\n\u2207\n(|\n\u1ebc|\n)\n+\n\u22074 \u03b4ns = 0 .\ns\ns\n\u2202t2\n4mi\n4me mi\n\n2i\u03c9pe\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nHere \u1ebc is the slowly varying envelope electric field defined via\nEf =\n\n1\n(\u1ebc e\u2212i\u03c9pe t + \u1ebc\u2217 ei\u03c9pe t ) ,\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c9pe is the electron plasma frequency. Also, in Eqs. (2\u20133) c is the speed of light in\nvacuum, h\u0304 the scaled Planck constant, \u03b50 the vacuum permittivity and mi the ion mass.\nIn addition, c2s = \u03baB TF e /mi , where \u03baB TF e = me vF2 e . Therefore, cs is a Fermi ion-acoustic\nspeed, with the Fermi temperature replacing the thermal temperature for the electrons.\nIn comparison to the classical Zakharov system (see Eqs. (2.48a)\u2013(2.48b) of Ref. [3]),\nthere is the inclusion of the extra dispersive terms proportional to h\u03042 in Eqs. (2)\u2013(3).\nOther quantum difference is the presence of the Fermi speed instead of the thermal speed\nin the last term at the left hand side of Eq. (2). From the qualitative point of view, the\nterms proportional to h\u03042 are responsible for extra dispersion which can avoid collapsing of\nLangmuir envelopes, at least in principle. This possibility is investigated in Sections 4 and\n5. Finally, notice the non trivial form of the fourth order derivative term in Eq. (2). It is\nnot simply proportional to \u22074 \u1ebc as could be wrongly guessed from the quantum Zakharov\n\nequations in 1 + 1 dimensions, where there is a \u223c \u2202 4 \u1ebc/\u2202x4 contribution [4].\n\n4\n\n\fIt is useful to consider the rescaling\n\u221a\n2 \u03bc \u03c9pe r\nr\u0304 =\n, t\u0304 = 2 \u03bc \u03c9pet ,\nvF e\n\u03b4ns\ne \u1ebc\nn =\n, E= \u221a\n,\n4\u03bcn0\n4 \u03bc me \u03c9pe vF e\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03bc = me /mi . Then, dropping the bars in r, t, we obtain\nc2\n\u2202E\n\u2212 2 \u2207 \u00d7 (\u2207 \u00d7 E) + \u2207(\u2207 * E) =\n\u2202t\nvF e\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= n E + \u0393 \u2207 \u22072 (\u2207 * E) ,\n\u22022n\n\u2212 \u22072 n \u2212 \u22072 (|E|2 ) + \u0393 \u22074 n = 0 ,\n\u2202t2\n\ni\n\nwhere\nme\n\u0393=\nmi\n\n\u0012\n\nh\u0304 \u03c9pe\n\u03baB TF e\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\n\u00132\n\n(8)\n\nis a non-dimensional parameter associated with the quantum effects. Usually, it is an extremely small quantity, but it is nevertheless interesting to retain the \u223c \u0393 terms, specially\nfor the collapse scenarios. The reason is not only due to a general theoretical motivation,\nbut also because from some simple estimates one concludes that these terms become of the\nsame order as some of other terms in Eqs. (2)\u2013(3) provided that the characteristic length l\n\u22121/3\n\nfor the spatial derivatives becomes as small as the mean inter-particle distance, l \u223c n0\n\n.\n\nOf course, the Zakharov equations are not able to describe the late stages of the collapse,\nsince they do not include dissipation, which is unavoidable for short scales. But even Landau\ndamping would be irrelevant for a zero-temperature Fermi plasma, where the main influence\ncomes from the Pauli pressure. In the left-hand side of Eq. (6), the \u2207(\u2207 * E) term is retained\nbecause the \u223c c2 /vF2 e transverse term disappears in the electrostatic approximation.\n\nIn the adiabatic limit, neglecting \u2202 2 n/\u2202t2 in Eq. (7) and under appropriated boundary\n\nconditions, it follows that\nn = \u2212|E|2 + \u0393 \u22072 n ,\n\n(9)\n\nWhen \u0393 6= 0, it is not easy to directly express n as a function of |E| as in the classical\ncase. Therefore, the adiabatic limit is not enough to derive a vector nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation, due to the coupling in Eq. (9).\n\n5\n\n\fIII.\n\nLAGRANGIAN STRUCTURE AND CONSERVATION LAWS\n\nThe quantum Zakharov equations (6)\u2013(7) can be described by the Lagrangian density\ni \u0010 \u2217 \u2202E\nc2\n\u2202E \u2217 \u0011\nL =\nE *\n\u2212 2 |\u2207 \u00d7 E|2 \u2212 |\u2207 * E|2 \u2212 \u0393 |\u2207(\u2207 * E)|2\n\u2212E *\n2\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\nvF e\n\u0011\n\u0011 1\u0010\n\u0010 \u2202\u03b1\n2\n2\n2\n2\nn + \u0393|\u2207n| + |\u2207\u03b1| ,\n+ n\n\u2212 |E| \u2212\n\u2202t\n2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere n, the auxiliary function \u03b1 and the components of E, E \u2217 are regarded as independent\nfields.

The present formalism is inspired by the Lagrangian\nformulation of the classical Zakharov equations [29].\nThe quantum Zakharov equations admit as exact conserved quantities the \"number of\nplasmons\" of the Langmuir field,\nN=\n\nZ\n\n|E|2 dr ,\n\nthe linear momentum (with components Pi , i = x, y, z),\n\u0013\nZ h \u0012\n\u2202Ej\u2217\ni\n\u2202\u03b1 i\n\u2217 \u2202Ej\nPi =\nEj\n\u2212 Ej\n\u2212n\ndr\n2\n\u2202ri\n\u2202ri\n\u2202ri\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nand the Hamiltonian,\nZ h\nc2\nH =\nn|E|2 + 2 |\u2207 \u00d7 E|2 + |\u2207 * E|2 + \u0393 |\u2207(\u2207 * E)|2\nvF e\n\u0011i\n\u0010\n1 2\nn + \u0393|\u2207n|2 + |\u2207\u03b1|2 dr .\n+\n2\n6\n\n(16)\n\n\fFurthermore, there is also a preserved angular momenta functional, but it is not relevant\nin the present work. These four conserved quantities can be associated, through Noether's\ntheorem, to the invariance of the action under gauge transformation, time translation, space\ntranslation and rotations, respectively. The conservation laws can be used e. g. to test the\naccuracy of numerical procedures. Also, observe that equations (7) and (9) for the adiabatic\nlimit are described by the same Lagrangian density (10). In this approximation, it suffices\nto set \u03b1 \u2261 0.\nIn addition to the adiabatic limit, Eq. (9) can be further approximated to\nn = \u2212|E|2 \u2212 \u0393\u22072 (|E|2) ,\n\n(17)\n\nassuming that the quantum term is a perturbation. In this way and using Eq.

(18)\nare investigated, assuming adiabatic conditions for collapsing quantum Langmuir envelopes.\nOther scenarios for collapse, like the supersonic one [18, 19], could also be relevant and shall\nbe investigated in the future.\n7\n\n\fIV.\n\nVARIATIONAL SOLUTION IN TWO DIMENSIONS\n\nConsider the adiabatic semiclassical system defined by Eq. (18). We refer to localized\nsolution for this vector NLS equation as (quantum) \"Langmuir wave packets\", or envelopes.\nAs discussed in detail in [29] in the purely classical case, Langmuir wave packets will become\nsingular in a finite time, provided the energy is not bounded from below. Of course, explicit\nanalytic Langmuir envelopes are difficult to derive. A fruitful approach is to make use of the\nLagrangian structure for deriving approximate solutions. This approach has been pursued\nin [30] for the classical and in [9] for the quantum Zakharov system. Both studies considered\nthe internal vibrations of Langmuir envelopes in one-spatial-dimension. Presently, we shall\napply the time-dependent Rayleigh-Ritz method for the higher-dimensional cases. A priori,\nit is expected that the quantum corrections would inhibit the collapse of localized solutions,\nin view of wave-packet spreading. To check this conjecture, and to have more definite\ninformation on the influence of the quantum terms, first we consider the following Ansatz,\nE=\n\n\u0012\n\nN\n\u03c0\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\n1\n\u03c12\nexp \u2212 2 exp i(\u0398 + k\u03c12 ) (cos \u03c6, sin \u03c6, 0) ,\n\u03c3\n2\u03c3\n\n(21)\n\nwhich is appropriate for two-spatial-dimensions. Here \u03c3, k, \u0398 and \u03c6 are real functions of\np\ntime, and \u03c1 = x2 + y 2. The normalization condition (14) is automatically satisfied (in\n2D the spatial integrations reduce to integrations on the plane). Other localized forms,\n\ninvolving e. g. a sech type dependence, could have been also proposed. Here a Gaussian\nform was suggested mainly for the sake of simplicity [31]. Notice that the envelope electric\nfield (21) is not necessarily electrostatic: it can carry a transverse (\u2207 \u00d7 E =\n6 0) component.\nThe free functions in Eq. (21) should be determined by extremization of the action\nfunctional associated with the Lagrangian density (19). A straightforward calculation gives\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nZ\nh\nc\n1\nN\n2c2 2 2 1\n2\n\u2212\nL2 \u2261\nLad,sc dx dy = \u2212N \u0398\u0307 + \u03c3 k\u0307 + 2 k \u03c3 +\n2\nvF e\n2 vF e 2\u03c0 \u03c3 2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nN\n\u0393 i\n+ 8\u0393k 2 + 16\u0393k 4 \u03c3 4 + 1 +\n,\n(22)\n2\u03c0 \u03c3 4\nwhere only the main quantum contributions are retained. Now L2 is the Lagrangian for a\nmechanical system, after the spatial form of the envelope electric field was defined in advance\nvia Eq. (21). Of special interest is the behavior of the dispersion \u03c3. For a collapsing solution\none could expect that \u03c3 goes to zero in a finite time. The phase \u0398 and the chirp function\n8\n\n\fk should be regarded as auxiliary fields. Notice that L2 is not dependent on the angle \u03c6,\nwhich remains arbitrary as far as the variational method is concerned.\nApplying the functional derivative of L2 with respect to \u0398, we obtain\n\u03b4L2\n=0\n\u03b4\u0398\n\n\u2192\n\n\u1e44 = 0 ,\n\n(23)\n\nso that the variational solution preserves the number of plasmons, as expected. The remaining Euler-Lagrange equations are\n\u03b4L2\n=0\n\u03b4k\n\u03b4L2\n=0\n\u03b4\u03c3\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\n2c2 2\n\u03c3 k + 8\u0393k + 32\u0393\u03c3 4 k 3 ,\nvF2 e\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nc\n1\n2c2 2\n1\nN\n\u03c3 k\u0307 = \u2212 2 k \u03c3 +\n\u2212\n\u2212 32\u0393k 4 \u03c3 3\n2\nvF e\n2 vF e 2\u03c0 \u03c3 3\n\u0013\n\u0012\nN 2\u0393\n.\n+ 1+\n2\u03c0 \u03c3 5\n\n\u03c3 \u03c3\u0307 =\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\nThe exact solution of the nonlinear system (24\u201325) is difficult to obtain, but at least the\ndynamics was reduced to ordinary differential equations.\nIt is instructive to analyze the purely classical (\u0393 \u2261 0) case first. This is specially true,\nsince to our knowledge the Rayleigh-Ritz method was not applied to the vector NLS equation\n(18), even for classical systems. The reason can be due to the calculational complexity\ninduced by the transverse term. When \u0393 = 0, Eq. (24) gives k = vF2 e \u03c3\u0307/2c2 \u03c3. Inserting this\nin Eq. (25) we have\n\u03c3\u0308 = \u2212\n\n\u2202V2c\n,\n\u2202\u03c3\n\n(26)\n\nwhere the pseudo-potential V2c is\nc2\nV2c = 2\n2vF e\n\n\u0012\n\nN\nc2\n\u2212\n2\nvF e 2\u03c0\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n.\n\u03c32\n\n(27)\n\nFrom Eq. (27) it is evident that the repulsive character of the pseudo-potential will be\nconverted into an attractive one, whenever the number of plasmons exceeds a threshold,\nN>\n\n2\u03c0c2\n,\nvF2 e\n\n(28)\n\na condition for Langmuir wave packet collapse in the classical two-dimensional case. The\ninterpretation of the result is as follows. When the number of plasmons satisfy Eq. (28),\nthe refractive \u223c |E|4 term dominates over the dispersive terms in the Lagrangian density\n(19), producing a singularity in a finite time. Finally, notice the ballistic motion when\nN = 2\u03c0c2 /vF2 e , which can also lead to singularity.\n9\n\n\fFurther insight follows after evaluating the energy integral (20) with the Ansatz (21),\nwhich gives, after eliminating k,\nHad,sc,2c\n\nNvF2 e\n=\nc2\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03c3\u0307 2\n+ V2c\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n(\u0393 \u2261 0) .\n\n(29)\n\nOf course, this energy first integral could be obtained directly from Eq. (26). However, the\nplausibility of the variational solution is reinforced, since Eq. (29) shows that it preserves\nthe exact constant of motion Had,sc . In addition, in the attractive (collapsing) case the\nenergy (29) is not bounded from bellow.\nIn the quantum (\u0393 6= 0) case, Eq. (24) becomes a cubic equation in k, whose exact\nsolution is too cumbersome to be of practical use. It is better to proceed by successive\napproximations, taking into account that the quantum and electromagnetic terms are small.\nIn this way, one arrives at\n\u03c3\u0308 = \u2212\n\n\u2202V2\n,\n\u2202\u03c3\n\n(30)\n\nwhere the pseudo-potential V2 is\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n\u0012\n1\n1\n\u0393c2\nc\nN\nN\nc2\n+ 2\n.\n\u2212\n1+\nV2 = 2\n2\n2\n2vF e vF e 2\u03c0 \u03c3\nvF e\n2\u03c0 \u03c3 4\n\n(31)\n\nNow, even if the threshold (28) is exceeded, the repulsive \u223c \u03c3 \u22124 quantum term in V2 will\nprevent singularities. This adds quantum diffraction as another physical mechanism, besides\ndissipation and Landau damping, so that collapsing Langmuir wave packets are avoided in\nvector NLS equation. Also, similar to Eq. (29), it can be shown that the approximate\ndynamics preserves the energy integral, even in the quantum case. Indeed, calculating from\nEq. (20) and the variational solution gives Had,sc as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nNvF2 e \u03c3\u0307 2\n+ V2\nHad,sc,2 =\nc2\n2\n\n(\u0393 \u2265 0) .\n\n(32)\n\nFrom Eq. (30), obviously \u1e22ad,sc,2 = 0.\nIt should be noticed that oscillations of purely quantum nature are obtained when the\nnumber of plasmons exceeds the threshold (28). Indeed, in this case the pseudo-potential\nV2 in Eq. (31) assumes a potential well form as shown in Figure 1, which clearly admits\noscillations around a minimum \u03c3 = \u03c3m . Here,\n\u0014\n\n\u0393(1 + N/2\u03c0)\n\u03c3m = 2\nN/2\u03c0 \u2212 c2 /vF2 e\n10\n\n\u00151/2\n\n.\n\n(33)\n\n\fV2\n\n\u03a3\n\nFIG. 1: The qualitative form of the pseudo-potential in Eq. (31) for N > 2\u03c0c2 /vF2 e .\n\nAlso, the minimum value of V2 is\n(N/2\u03c0 \u2212 c2 /vF2 e )2\n1\nc2\n>\u2212\nV2 (\u03c3m ) = \u2212\n2\n16\u0393 vF e\n1 + N/2\u03c0\n16\u0393\n\n\u0012\n\nN\nc2\n\u2212 2\n2\u03c0 vF e\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(34)\n\nthe last inequality follows since Eq. (28) is assumed. Therefore, a deepest potential well\nis obtained when N is increasing. Also, for too large quantum effects the trapping of the\nlocalized electric field in this potential well would be difficult, since V2 (\u03c3m ) \u2192 0\u2212 as \u0393\nincreases. This is due to the dispersive nature of the quantum corrections.\nThe frequency \u03c9 of the small amplitude oscillations is derived linearizing Eq. (30) around\nthe equilibrium point (33). Restoring physical coordinates via Eq. (5) this frequency is\ncalculated as\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u03baB TF e\nc\n(N/2\u03c0 \u2212 c2 /vF2 e )3/2\n\u03c9 = \u221a\n\u03c9pe\nh\u0304 \u03c9pe\n1 + N/2\u03c0\n2 vF e\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00133/2\n\u0012\nN\nc2\nvF e\n\u03baB TF e\n\u2212\n\u03c9pe .\n< \u221a\nh\u0304 \u03c9pe\n2\u03c0 vF2 e\n2c\n\n(35)\n\nTo conclude, the variational solution suggests that the extra dispersion arising from\nthe quantum terms would inhibit the collapse of Langmuir wave packets in two-spatialdimensions. Moreover, for sufficient electric field energy (which is proportional to N), instead of collapse there will be oscillations of the width of the localized solution, due to the\ncompetition between the classical refraction and the quantum diffraction. The frequency of\n11\n\n\flinear oscillations is then given by Eq. (35). The emergence of a pulsating Langmuir envelope\nis a qualitatively new phenomena, which could be tested quantitatively in experiments.\n\nV.\n\nVARIATIONAL SOLUTION IN THREE-DIMENSIONS\n\nIt is worth to study the dynamics of localized solutions for the vector NLS equation (18)\nin fully three-dimensional space. For this purpose, we consider the Gaussian form\n\u0012\n\u0015\n\u00131/2 \u0014\nN\nr2\n2\nE= \u221a\n(36)\nexp \u2212 2 +i(\u0398+k r ) (cos \u03c6 sin \u03b8, sin \u03c6 sin \u03b8, cos \u03b8) ,\n2\u03c3\n( \u03c0 \u03c3)3\np\nwhere \u03c3, k, \u0398, \u03b8 and \u03c6 are real functions of time and r =\nx2 + y 2 + z 2 , applying the\nRayleigh-Ritz method just like in the last Section. The normalization condition (14) is\nautomatically satisfied with Eq. (36), which, occasionally, can also support a transverse\n(\u2207 \u00d7 E =\n6 0) part.\nProceeding as before, the Lagrangian\nZ\nh\n3\n4 c2\nc2\nN\nL3 \u2261\nLad,sc dr = \u2212N \u0398\u0307 + \u03c3 2 k\u0307 + 2 k 2 \u03c3 2 + 2 2 \u2212 \u221a\n2\nvF e\nvF e \u03c3\n4 2 \u03c0 3/2 \u03c3 3\ni\n3 \u0393N\n5\u0393\n2\n4 4\n+ \u221a\n+ 10 \u0393k + 20 \u0393k \u03c3 +\n4 \u03c3 4 4 2 \u03c0 3/2 \u03c3 5\n\n(37)\n\nis derived. In comparison to the reduced 2D-Lagrangian in Eq. (22), there are different\nnumerical factors as well as qualitative changes due to higher-order nonlinearities. Also, the\nangular variables \u03b8 and \u03c6 don't appear in L3 .\nThe main remaining task is to analyze the dynamics of the width \u03c3 as a function of time.\nThis is achieved from the Euler-Lagrange equations for the action functional associated to\nL3 . As before, \u03b4L3 /\u03b4\u0398 = 0 gives \u1e44 = 0, a consistency test satisfied by the variational\nsolution.

Hence, in fully threedimensional space there is more \"room\" for a collapsing dynamics.

Moreover, when \u0393 6= 0 an oscillatory behavior is possible, provided a certain\ncondition, to be explained in the following, is meet.\nTo examine the possibility of oscillations, consider V3\u2032 (\u03c3) = 0, the equation for the critical\npoints of V3 .

In deriving Eq. (45), it was omitted a term negligible\nexcept if s \u223c c2 /vF2 e , which is unlikely.\nThe quantity g plays a decisive r\u00f4le on the shape of V3 . Indeed, calculating the discriminant shows that the solutions to the cubic in Eq. (45) are as follows: (a) g < 1 \u2192 three\ndistinct real roots (one negative and two positive); (b) g = 1 \u2192 one negative root, one\n(positive) double root; (c) g > 1 \u2192 one (negative) real root, two complex conjugate roots.\nTherefore, g < 1 is the condition for the existence of a potential well, which can support\noscillations. This is shown in Figure 3. The analytic formulae for the solutions of the cubic\nin Eq. (45) are cumbersome and will be omitted.\nRestoring physical coordinates, the necessary condition for oscillations is rewritten as\n\u221a\nZ\n30\u03c0\n\u03b50\n2\n|\u1ebc| dr >\nme vF e c ,\n(47)\ng<1 \u2192\n2\n\u03b3\nwhere \u03b3 = e2 /4 \u03c0\u03b50 h\u0304 c \u2243 1/137 is the fine structure constant. From Eq. (47) it is seen\nthat for sufficient electrostatic energy the width \u03c3 of the localized envelope field can show\noscillations, supported by the competition between classical refraction and quantum diffraction. Also, due to the Fermi pressure, for large particle densities the inequality (47) becomes\n1/3\n\nmore difficult to be met, since vF e \u223c n0 . For example, when n0 \u223c 1036 m\u22123 (white dwarf),\n\nthe right-hand-side of Eq. (47) is 0.6 GeV. For n0 \u223c 1033 m\u22123 (the next generation intense\nlaser-solid density plasma experiments), it is 57.5 MeV.\n14\n\n\fFinally, notice that Had,sc from Eq. (20), evaluated with the variational solution (36),\n\nis proportional to \u03c3\u0307 2 /2 + V3 , which is a constant of motion for Eq. (43). Therefore, the\napproximate solution preserves one of the basic first integrals of the vector NLS equation\n(18), as it should be.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, the quantum Zakharov system in fully three-dimensional space has been\nderived. An associated Lagrangian structure was found, as well as the pertinent conservation\nlaws. From the Lagrangian formalism, many possibilities are opened. Here, the variational\ndescription was used to analyze the behavior of localized envelope electric fields of Gaussian\nshape, in both two- and three-space dimensions. It was shown that the quantum corrections induce qualitative and quantitative changes, inhibiting singularities and allowing for\noscillations of the width of the Langmuir envelope field. This new dynamics can be tested\nin experiments. In particular, the r\u00f4le of the parameter g and the inequality in Eq. (47)\nshould be investigated. However, the variational method was applied only for the adiabatic\nand semiclassical case, which allows to derive the quantum modified vector NLS equation\n(18). Other, more general, scenarios for the solutions of the fully three-dimensional quantum\nZakharov system are also worth to study, with numerical and real experiments.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partially supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.
