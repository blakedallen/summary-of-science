In the paper\n[5] we extended de Vries Duality Theorem [2] to the category HLC of locally compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps and denoted by DLC the obtained dual\ncategory and by \u039bt : HLC \u2212\u2192 DLC and \u039ba : DLC \u2212\u2192 HLC the corresponding duality functors. In the paper [6] we extended in two ways the Stone Duality\nTheorem [18]: first, to the category ZLC of locally compact zero-dimensional Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps, and, second, to the cofull subcategory PZLC of\nthe category ZLC determined by the perfect maps (this means that the category\nPZLC has the same objects as the category ZLC but the morphisms of the category\nPZLC are the perfect maps). We denoted by ZLBA the obtained dual category of\nthe category ZLC, by \u0398t : ZLC \u2212\u2192 ZLBA and \u0398a : ZLBA \u2212\u2192 ZLC the corresponding duality functors, and by GBPL the obtained dual category of the category\nPZLC, and by \u0398tg : PZLC \u2212\u2192 GBPL and \u0398ag : GBPL \u2212\u2192 PZLC the corresponding duality functors. The objects of the category GBPL are the generalized\nBoolean pseudolattices and the morphisms of this category are the 0-pseudolattice\nhomomorphisms satisfying an additional condition.\nThe first section of the paper contains some preliminary results.\nIn the second section of this paper, we prove some new Stone-type duality\ntheorems for some subcategories of the category ZLC. These theorems are new\neven in the compact case (see Theorems 2.2, 2.4(b),(c), 2.6,2.8(b),2.11(b),2.14).\nThey concern the cofull subcategories SkeZLC, QPZLC, OZLC and OPZLC\nof the category ZLC determined, respectively, by the skeletal maps (defined by\nMioduszewski and Rudolf in [14]), by the quasi-open (defined by S. Marde\u0161ic and\nP. Papic in [12]) perfect maps, by the open maps, and by the open perfect maps.\nSince the categories QPZLC and OPZLC are cofull subcategories simultaneously\nof the categories ZLC and PZLC, we find their images by the both functors \u0398t and\n\u0398tg (see Corollary 2.4(b), Theorem 2.6 and Corollary 2.14). For the compact case,\nthese theorems give the following results:\n(a) The category QZHC of compact zero-dimensional Hausdorff spaces and\nquasi-open maps is dually equivalent to the category BoolC of Boolean algebras\nand complete Boolean homomorphisms (see Corollary 2.4(c)), and\n(b) The category OZHC of compact zero-dimensional Hausdorff spaces and\nopen maps is dually equivalent to the category OBool of Boolean algebras and\nBoolean homomorphisms \u03c6 having lower adjoint \u03c8 (i.e. the pair (\u03c8, \u03c6) forms a\nGalois connection (see Corollary 2.12(b)).\nLet us mention also the following result (see Theorem 2.6): The category\nQPZLC is dually equivalent to the cofull subcategory QGBPL of the category\nGBPL whose morphisms, in addition, preserve all meets that happen to exist.\nFrom the mentioned above Corollary 2.4(c) and Fedorchuk Duality Theorem\n[8], we obtain the following assertion which is a special case of a much more general\ntheorem of Monk [13]: a Boolean homomorphism can be extended to a complete\n2\n\n\fhomomorphism between the corresponding minimal completions iff it is a complete\nhomomorphism.\nNote also that Theorem 2.2 and Corollary 2.4(b),(c) are zero-dimensional analogues of Fedorchuk Duality Theorem [8] and its generalization presented in [4].\nIn the third section, we characterize the injective and surjective morphisms of\nthe categories ZLC and HLC and their subcategories discussed in [4, 5, 6, 3] by\nmeans of some properties of their dual morphisms. If f \u2208 HLC(X, Y ), then we\nuse its dual map \u039bt (f ), and if f \u2208 ZLC (resp., f \u2208 PZLC), we use its dual \u0398t (f )\n(resp., \u0398tg (f )). When f has some extra properties, e.g. if f is open or quasi-open,\nthe conditions on its dual map can be simplified and we do this. Such investigations\nwere done by M. Stone in [18] for mappings f \u2208 ZLC(X, Y ) which are either closed\nembeddings or surjective maps, and by de Vries [2] using his duality theorem. Here\nwe generalize these results. An analogous problem is investigated for the homeomorphic embeddings, dense embeddings, LCA-embeddings, closed embeddings. Our\nTheorem 3.31, in which we characterize LCA-embeddings, generalizes a theorem of\nFedorchuk [8, Theorem 6].\nFinally, in the fourth section, in analogue to some well-known results of M.\nStone [18], the dual objects of the open, regular open, clopen, closed, regular closed\netc. subsets of a space X \u2208 |HLC| or X \u2208 |ZLC| are described by means of the\ndual objects \u039bt (X), \u0398t (X) or \u0398tg (X) of X. Some of these results (e.g., for regular\nclosed sets) are new even in the compact case. For example, we prove the following\n(see Theorem 4.10): Let I and J be generalized Boolean pseudolattices, X = \u0398ag (I)\nand F = \u0398ag (J); then F is homeomorphic to a regular closed subset of X iff there\nexists a surjective 0-pseudolattice homomorphism \u03c6 : I \u2212\u2192 J which preserves all\nmeets that happen to exist in I. Hence, if A and B are Boolean algebras, X = S a (A)\nand F = S a (B) then F is homeomorphic to a regular closed subset of X iff there\nexists a complete epimorphism \u03c6 : A \u2212\u2192 B (here S a : Bool \u2212\u2192 ZHC is the Stone\nduality functor).\nIn this paper we use the notations introduced in [4, 5, 6, 3], as well as the\nnotions and the results from these papers. In the first section we recall many of\nthem. Let us mention some more notations. If (A, \u2264) is a poset and a \u2208 A then \u2193 a\nis the set {b \u2208 A | b \u2264 a}.

Recall that a distributive\n{0}-pseudolattice A is called a generalized Boolean pseudolattice if it satisfies the\nfollowing condition:\n(GBPL) for every a, b, c \u2208 A such that b \u2264 a \u2264 c there exists x \u2208 A with a \u2227 x = b\nand a \u2228 x = c (i.e., x is the relative complement of a in the interval [b, c]).\nLet A be a distributive {0}-pseudolattice and Idl(A) be the frame of all ideals\nof A.

Note that \u00acJ = {a \u2208 A | (\u2200b \u2208\nJ)(a \u2227 b = 0)} (see Stone [18]). Recall that an ideal J of A is called simple (Stone\n[18]) if J \u2228 \u00acJ = A (i.e. J has a complement in Idl(A)). As it is proved in [18], the\nset Si(A) of all simple ideals of A is a Boolean algebra with respect to the lattice\noperations in Idl(A).\n5\n\n\fFact 1.10 ([6]) (a) A distributive {0}-pseudolattice A is a generalized Boolean pseudolattice iff every principal ideal of A is simple.\n(b) If A is a generalized Boolean pseudolattice then the correspondence eA : A \u2212\u2192\nSi(A), a 7\u2192\u2193 (a), is a dense {0}-pseudolattice embedding of A in the Boolean algebra\nSi(A) and the pair (Si(A), eA (A)) is an LBA.\n(c)(M.

Having in mind Theorem 1.16, it is enough to prove that if f is a SkeZLCmorphism then \u0398t (f ) is complete, and if \u03c6 is a SkeZLBA-morphism then \u0398a (\u03c6) is\na skeletal map.\nSo, let f \u2208 SkeZLC(X, Y ) and \u03c6 = \u0398t (f ). Then \u03c6 : (CO(Y ), CK(Y )) \u2212\u2192\n(CO(X), CK(X)) and \u03c6(G) = f \u22121 (G), for all G \u2208 CO(Y ). SLet {G\u03b3 | \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393} \u2286\nCO(Y ) and let this family have a join G in CO(Y ). Set W = {G\u03b3 |S\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393}. Since\nY is zero-dimensional, we get easily that G = cl(W ). Thus \u03c6(G) \u2287 cl( {\u03c6(G\u03b3 ) | \u03b3 \u2208\n\u0393}) = F . Let x \u2208 f \u22121 (G)(= \u03c6(G)). Then f (x) \u2208 G and there exists a neighborhood\nU of x such that f (U) \u2286 G. Suppose that x 6\u2208 F . Then there exists a neighborhood\nV of x such that V \u2286 U and V \u2229 f \u22121 (G\u03b3 ) = \u2205 for all \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393. Thus f (V ) \u2229 W = \u2205.\nThen cl(f (V )) \u2229 W = \u2205. Since cl(f (V )) \u2286 cl(f (U)) \u2286 G = cl(W ), we get that\ncl(f (V )) \u2286 cl(W ) \\ W (= Fr(W )). This leads to a contradiction because f is skeletal\nand thus int(cl(f (V ))) 6= \u2205 (by [4, Lemma 2.4]). So, \u03c6(G) = f \u22121 (G) = F . Since\n\u03c6(G) is clopen, we get that \u03c6(G) is the join of the family {\u03c6(G\u03b3 ) | \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393} in CO(X).\nTherefore, \u03c6 is complete.\nLet now \u03c6 \u2208 SkeZLBA((A, I), (B, J)) and f = \u0398a (\u03c6). Set X = \u0398a (A, I)\nand Y = \u0398a (B, J). Then f : Y \u2212\u2192 X. Since CK(Y ) is an open base of Y , for\nproving that f is skeletal it is enough to show that for every G \u2208 CK(Y ) \\ {\u2205},\nint(f (G)) 6= \u2205. So, let G \u2208VCK(Y ) \\ {\u2205}. Then there exists b \u2208 J \\ {0} such that\nG = \u03bbgB (b). Suppose that {cV\n\u2208 A | b \u2264 \u03c6(c)} = 0. Then, using the completeness\nof \u03c6, we get that 0 = \u03c6(0) = {\u03c6(c) | c \u2208 A, b \u2264 \u03c6(c)} \u2265 b. Since b 6= 0, we get\na contradiction. Hence there exists a \u2208 A \\ {0} such that a \u2264 c for all c \u2208 A for\nwhich b \u2264 \u03c6(c). We will prove that \u03bbgA (a) \u2286 f (\u03bbgB (b))(= f (G)). This will imply\nthat int(f (G)) 6= \u2205. Let u \u2208 \u03bbgA (a). Then a \u2208 u. Suppose that there exists c \u2208 u\nsuch that b \u2227 \u03c6(c) = 0. Then b \u2264 \u03c6(c\u2217 ). Thus a \u2264 c\u2217 , i.e. a \u2227 c = 0. Since a, c \u2208 u,\nwe get a contradiction. Therefore, the set {b} \u222a \u03c6(u) is a filter-base. Hence there\nexists an ultrafilter v in B such that {b} \u222a \u03c6(u) \u2286 v. Then b \u2208 v and u \u2286 \u03c6\u22121 (v).\nThus u = \u03c6\u22121 (v), i.e. f (v) = u. So, u \u2208 f (\u03bbgB (b)).\n8\n\n\fRemarks 2.3 Note that in the definition of the category SkeZLBA the requirement that the morphisms \u03c6 : (A, I) \u2212\u2192 (B, J) are complete can be replaced by the\nfollowing condition:\n(SkeZLBA) For every b \u2208 J \\ {0} there exists a \u2208 I \\ {0} such that (\u2200c \u2208 A)[(b \u2264\n\u03c6(c)) \u2192 (a \u2264 c)].\nIndeed, the proof of the above theorem shows the sufficiency of this condition and\nits necessity can be established as follows. Let f \u2208 SkeZLC(X, Y ) and \u03c6 = \u0398t (f ).\nThen \u03c6 : (CO(Y ), CK(Y )) \u2212\u2192 (CO(X), CK(X)) and \u03c6(G) = f \u22121 (G), for all\nG \u2208 CO(Y ). Let F \u2208 CK(X) \\ {\u2205}. Then int(f (F )) 6= \u2205. Hence there exists\nG \u2208 CK(Y ) \\ {\u2205} such that G \u2286 int(f (F )). Let H \u2208 CO(Y ) and F \u2286 f \u22121 (H).\nThen G \u2286 int(f (F )) \u2286 f (F ) \u2286 H. So, condition (SkeZLBA) is satisfied.\nMoreover, condition (SkeZLBA) can be replaced by the following one:\n(CEP) For every b \u2208 B \\ {0} there exists a \u2208 A \\ {0} such that (\u2200c \u2208 A)[(b \u2264\n\u03c6(c)) \u2192 (a \u2264 c)].\nIndeed, if b \u2208 B \\ {0} then, by the density of J in B, there exists b1 \u2208 I \\ {0} such\nthat b1 \u2264 b. Now, applying (SkeZLBA) for b1 , we get an a \u2208 I \\ {0} which satisfies\nalso the requirements of (CEP) about b. Conversely, if b \u2208 J \\ {0} then, by (CEP),\nthere exists a \u2208 A \\ {0} such that (\u2200c \u2208 A)[(b \u2264 \u03c6(c)) \u2192 (a \u2264 c)]; but, by condition\n(ZLBA) (see 1.14), there exists a1 \u2208 I such that b \u2264 \u03c6(a1 ); thus a \u2264 a1 ; since I is\nan ideal, we get that a \u2208 I; so, condition (SkeZLBA) is satisfied.\nWe denote by S t : ZHC \u2212\u2192 Bool and S a : Bool \u2212\u2192 ZHC the Stone duality\nfunctors between the categories ZHC of compact zero-dimensional Hausdorff spaces\nand continuous maps and Bool of Boolean algebras and Boolean homomorphisms.\nThe assertion (c) of the next corollary is a zero-dimensional analogue of the\nFedorchuk Duality Theorem [8].\nCorollary 2.4 (a) Let f be a PZLC-morphism. Then f is a quasi-open map (see\n[4] for this notion) iff \u0398t (f ) is complete. In particular, if f is a ZHC-morphism\nthen f is a quasi-open map iff S t (f ) is complete.\n(b) The cofull subcategory QPZLC of the category PZLC (see 1.20) whose morphisms are, in addition, quasi-open maps, is dually equivalent to the cofull subcategory QPZLBA of the category PZLBA whose morphisms are, in addition,\ncomplete homomorphisms;\n(c) The category QZHC of compact zero-dimensional Hausdorff spaces and quasiopen maps is dually equivalent to the category BoolC of Boolean algebras and complete Boolean homomorphisms.\nProof. The assertion (a) follows from the proof of Theorem 2.2 and [4, Corollary\n2.5]. The assertions (b) and (c) follow from (a) and Theorem 2.2.\nThe last corollary together with Fedorchuk Duality Theorem [8] imply the\nfollowing assertion in which the equivalence (a) \u21d0\u21d2 (b) is a special case of a much\nmore general theorem due to Monk [13].\n9\n\n\fCorollary 2.5 Let \u03c6 \u2208 Bool(A, B) and A\u2032 , B \u2032 be minimal completions of A and\nB respectively. We can suppose that A \u2286 A\u2032 and B \u2286 B \u2032 . Then the following\nconditions are equivalent:\n(a) \u03c6 can be extended to a complete homomorphism \u03c8 : A\u2032 \u2212\u2192 B \u2032 ;\n(b) \u03c6 is a complete homomorphism;\n(c) \u03c6 satisfies condition (CEP) (see 2.3 above).\nProof. (a)\u21d2(b) This is obvious.\n(b)\u21d2(c) This was already established in the proof of Theorem 2.2 (see also 2.3).\n(c)\u21d2(a) Obviously, \u03c6 \u2208 ZLBA((A, A), (B, B)). Then, by 2.3 and Theorem 2.2,\ncondition (CEP) implies that f = \u0398a (\u03c6)(= S a (\u03c6)) is a skeletal map. Since f\nis closed, we get that f is a quasi-open map between Y = \u0398a (B, B)(= S a (B))\nand X = \u0398a (A, A)(= S a (A)). Now, by Fedorchuk Duality Theorem [8], the map\n\u03c8 = \u03a8t (f ) : RC(X) \u2212\u2192 RC(Y ) is a complete homomorphism. Since, for every\nF \u2208 RC(X), \u03c8(F ) = cl(f \u22121 (int(F ))) and CO(X) is a subalgebra of the Boolean\nalgebra RC(X), we get that for every F \u2208 CO(X), \u03c8(F ) = f \u22121 (F ) = \u03c6\u2032 (F )\n(here \u03c6\u2032 = \u0398t (\u0398a (\u03c6))). Then the existence of a natural isomorphism between the\ncomposition \u0398t \u25e6 \u0398a and the identity functor (see Theorem 1.16), and the fact that\nRC(X) and RC(Y ) are minimal completions of, respectively, A and B, imply our\nassertion.\nNow, using Theorem 1.21, we will present in a simpler form the result established in Corollary 2.4(b).\nTheorem 2.6 The category QPZLC is dually equivalent to the cofull subcategory\nQGBPL of the category GBPL whose morphisms, in addition, preserve all meets\nthat happen to exist.\nProof. Having in mind Theorem 1.21 and Corollary 2.4(b), it is enough to show\nthat the functor E a (see 1.21) maps QPZLBA to QGBPL and the functor E b\n(see again 1.21) maps QGBPL to QPZLBA because with this we will obtain that\nthe categories QPZLBA and QGBPL are equivalent. Obviously, if \u03c6\u2032 : (A, I) \u2212\u2192\n(B, J) is a QPZLBA-morphism then \u03c6 = E a (\u03c6\u2032 ) = (\u03c6\u2032 )|I : I \u2212\u2192 J preserves all\nmeets in I that happen to exist (indeed, since I is an ideal of A, every meet in I\nof elements of I is also a meet in A). Conversely, let \u03c6 : I \u2212\u2192 J be a QGBPLmorphism. We will show that \u03c6 satisfies the following condition:\n(QGBPL) For every b \u2208 J \\ {0} there exists a \u2208 I \\ {0} such that (\u2200c \u2208 I)[(b \u2264\n\u03c6(c)) \u2192 (a \u2264 c)].\nV\nIndeed, let b \u2208 J \\ {0}. Suppose that I {c V\n\u2208 I | b \u2264 \u03c6(c)} = 0. Then, using the\ncompleteness of \u03c6, we get that 0 = \u03c6(0) = {\u03c6(c) | c \u2208 I, b \u2264 \u03c6(c)} \u2265 b. Since\nb 6= 0, we get a contradiction. Hence there exists a \u2208 I \\ {0} such that a \u2264 c for all\nc \u2208 I for which b \u2264 \u03c6(c).\nLet \u03c6\u2032 = E b (\u03c6). We will show that the map \u03c6\u2032 satisfies condition (SkeZLBA).\nWe have that \u03c6\u2032 : (SI(I), eI (I)) \u2212\u2192 (Si(J), eJ (J)). Let J1 \u2208 eJ (J)\\{0}. Then there\n10\n\n\fexists b \u2208 J \\ {0} such that J1 =\u2193 (b). By (QGBPL), there exists a \u2208 I \\ {0} such\nthat (\u2200c \u2208 I)[(b \u2264 \u03c6(c)) \u2192 (a \u2264 c)]. Let I1 \u2208 Si(I) and J1 \u2286 \u03c6\u2032 (I1S\n). Then, by the\n\u2032\ndefinition of the map \u03c6 (see Theorem 1.21), we have that \u2193 (b) \u2286 {\u2193 (\u03c6(c)) | c \u2208\nI1 }. Thus there exists c \u2208 I1 such that b \u2264 \u03c6(c). Since c \u2208 I, we get that a \u2264 c.\nTherefore, \u2193 (a) \u2286 I1 . So, the map \u03c6\u2032 satisfies condition (SkeZLBA). Now 2.3\nimplies that \u03c6\u2032 is a complete homomorphism. Thus \u03c6\u2032 is a QPZLBA-morphism.\n\nRemark 2.7 The proof of Theorem 2.6 shows that in the definition of the category\nQPZLBA the requirement that its morphisms \u03c6 : I \u2212\u2192 J preserve all meets that\nhappen to exist can be replaced by the condition (QGBPL) introduced above.\nTheorem 2.8 (a) Let f \u2208 ZLC(X, Y ), \u03c6 = \u0398t (f ), (A, I) = \u0398t (X) and (B, J) =\n\u0398t (Y ). Then the map f is open iff there exists a map \u03c8 : I \u2212\u2192 J which satisfies\nthe following conditions:\n(OZL1) For every b \u2208 J and every a \u2208 I, (a \u2227 \u03c6(b) = 0) \u2192 (\u03c8(a) \u2227 b = 0), and\n(OZL2) For every a \u2208 I, \u03c6(\u03c8(a)) \u2265 a\n(such a map \u03c8 will be called a lower P-preadjoint of \u03c6).\n(b) The cofull subcategory OZLC of the category ZLC whose morphisms are, in\naddition, open maps is dually equivalent to the cofull subcategory OZLBA of the\ncategory ZLBA whose morphisms have, in addition, lower P-preadjoints.\nProof. (a) Let f \u2208 ZLC(X, Y ) be an open map. For every F \u2208 CK(X)(= I) set\n\u03c8(F ) = f (F ). Then, clearly, \u03c8(F ) \u2208 CK(Y )(= J) and \u03c6(\u03c8(F )) = f \u22121 (f (F )) \u2287 F .\nHence, condition (OZL2) is satisfied. Let F \u2208 CK(X), G \u2208 CK(Y ) and F \u2227\u03c6(G) =\n0. Then F \u2229f \u22121 (G) = \u2205. Thus f (F )\u2229G = \u2205, i.e. \u03c8(F )\u2227G = 0. Therefore, condition\n(OZL1) is satisfied as well.\nLet now \u03c6 has a lower P-preadjoint. We will show that f \u2032 = \u0398a (\u03c6) is an open\nmap. This will imply that f is open. Let X \u2032 = \u0398a (\u0398t (X)) and Y \u2032 = \u0398a (\u0398t (Y )).\nSince \u03bbgA (I) is an open base of X \u2032 , it is enough to show that f \u2032 (\u03bbgA (a)) is an open\nset, for every a \u2208 I. So, let a \u2208 I. We will prove that f \u2032 (\u03bbgA (a)) = \u03bbgB (\u03c8(a)). Let\nu \u2208 \u03bbgA (a). Then a \u2208 u. Let v = f \u2032 (u), i.e. v = \u03c6\u22121 (u). By (OZL2), \u03c6(\u03c8(a)) \u2265 a\nand hence \u03c6(\u03c8(a)) \u2208 u. Thus \u03c8(a) \u2208 \u03c6\u22121 (u) = v, i.e. f \u2032 (u) \u2208 \u03bbgB (\u03c8(a)). Therefore\nf \u2032 (\u03bbgA (a)) \u2286 \u03bbgB (\u03c8(a)). Conversely, let v \u2208 \u03bbgB (\u03c8(a)). Then \u03c8(a) \u2208 v. Suppose that\nthere exists b \u2208 v such that a \u2227 \u03c6(b) = 0. Since v is a bounded ultrafilter, there\nexists b0 \u2208 v \u2229 J. Then b1 = b \u2227 b0 \u2208 J \u2229 v and a \u2227 \u03c6(b1 ) = 0. Now, condition (OZL1)\nimplies that \u03c8(a) \u2227 b1 = 0, which is a contradiction. Hence, the set {a} \u222a \u03c6(v) is\na filter-base. Thus there exists an ultrafilter u \u2287 {a} \u222a \u03c6(v). Then a \u2208 u \u2229 I and\nv \u2286 \u03c6\u22121 (u). Therefore, v = \u03c6\u22121 (u) = f (u). This shows that f \u2032 (\u03bbgA (a)) \u2287 \u03bbgB (\u03c8(a)).\nHence, f \u2032 is an open map.\n(b) It follows from (a) and Theorem 1.16.\n\n11\n\n\fRemarks 2.9 Note that condition (OZL2) implies condition (ZLBA). Indeed, in\nthe notations of Theorem 2.8, if a \u2208 I then b = \u03c8(a) \u2208 J and \u03c6(b) \u2265 a. Further,\ncondition (OZL1) implies that (again in the notations of Theorem 2.8) \u03c8(0) = 0.\nIndeed, 0 \u2227 \u03c6(\u03c8(0)) = 0 implies that \u03c8(0) \u2227 \u03c8(0) = 0, i.e. that \u03c8(0) = 0.\n2.10 Let us recall the notion of lower adjoint for posets. Let \u03c6 : A \u2212\u2192 B be an\norder-preserving map between posets. If \u03c8 : B \u2212\u2192 A is an order-preserving map\nsatisfying the following condition\n(\u039b) for all a \u2208 A and all b \u2208 B, b \u2264 \u03c6(a) iff \u03c8(b) \u2264 a\n(i.e. the pair (\u03c8, \u03c6) forms a Galois connection between posets B and A) then we will\nsay that \u03c8 is a lower adjoint of \u03c6. It is easy to see that condition (\u039b) is equivalent\nto the following condition:\n(\u039b\u2032 ) \u2200a \u2208 A and \u2200b \u2208 B, \u03c8(\u03c6(a)) \u2264 a and \u03c6(\u03c8(b)) \u2265 b.\nTheorem 2.11 (a) Let f \u2208 PZLC(X, Y ), (A, I) = \u0398t (X), (B, J) = \u0398t (Y ) and\n\u03c6 = \u0398t (f ). Then the map f is open iff \u03c6 : B \u2212\u2192 A has a lower adjoint \u03c8 : A \u2212\u2192 B.\n(b) The cofull subcategory OPZLC of the category PZLC whose morphisms are, in\naddition, open maps is dually equivalent to the cofull subcategory OPZLBA of the\ncategory PZLBA whose morphisms have, in addition, lower adjoints.\nProof. (a) Let f \u2208 PZLC(X, Y ) and f is open. Then set \u03c8(F ) = f (F ), for every\nF \u2208 CO(X)(= A). Then, since f is open and closed map, \u03c8 : A \u2212\u2192 B(= CO(Y )).\nObviously, \u03c6(\u03c8(F )) = f \u22121 (f (F )) \u2287 F for every F \u2208 CO(X) and \u03c8(\u03c6(G)) =\nf (f \u22121 (G)) \u2286 G for every G \u2208 CO(Y ). Hence \u03c8 is a lower adjoint of \u03c6. Conversely,\nlet \u03c6 has a lower adjoint \u03c8. Then \u03c8(I) \u2286 J. Indeed, let a \u2208 I. Then, by condition\n(ZLBA), there exists b \u2208 J such that a \u2264 \u03c6(b). Then \u03c8(a) \u2264 \u03c8(\u03c6(b)) \u2264 b \u2208 J.\nThus, \u03c8(a) \u2208 J. Further, condition (OZL2) is clearly fulfilled as well as condition\n(OZL1) (see, e.g., [4, Fact 1.22(a)]). So, (\u03c8)|I is a lower P-preadjoint of \u03c6. Then,\nby Theorem 2.8(a), f : X \u2212\u2192 Y is an open map.\n(b) It follows from (a) and Theorem 1.20.\nCorollary 2.12 (a) Let f \u2208 ZHC(X, Y ), \u03c6 = S t (f ), A = S t (X) and B = S t (Y ).\nThen the map f is open iff \u03c6 : B \u2212\u2192 A has a lower adjoint \u03c8 : A \u2212\u2192 B.\n(b) The category OZHC of compact zero-dimensional Hausdorff spaces and open\nmaps is dually equivalent to the category OBool of Boolean algebras and Boolean\nhomomorphisms having lower adjoints.\nProof. It follows immediately from Theorem 2.11.\nDefinition 2.13 Let \u03c6 \u2208 GBPL(J, I). If \u03c8 : I \u2212\u2192 J is a map which satisfies\nconditions (OZL1) and (OZL2) (see 2.8) then \u03c8 is called a lower preadjoint of \u03c6.\nLet OGBPL be the cofull subcategory of the category GBPL whose morphisms have, in addition, lower preadjoints.\n12\n\n\fCorollary 2.14 The categories OPZLC and OGBPL are dually equivalent.\nProof. It follows from Theorems 1.21, 2.8 and 2.11. Indeed, it is enough to show\nthat the categories OGBPL and OPZLBA are equivalent. From the proof of\nTheorem 2.11, it follows that if \u03c6\u2032 is an OPZLBA-morphism then \u03c6 = E a (\u03c6\u2032 ) has\na lower preadjoint. Conversely, if \u03c6 is an OGBPL-morphism then \u03c6\u2032 = E b (\u03c6) can\nbe regarded as an extension of \u03c6. This implies immediately that \u03c6\u2032 has a lower\nP-preadjoint. Now, Theorem 2.8 implies that f = \u0398a (\u03c6\u2032 ) is an open map. Thus, by\nTheorem 2.11, \u03c6\u2032 has a lower adjoint.\n\n3\n\nSurjective and Injective Maps. Embeddings\n\nIn this section we will investigate the following problem: characterize the injective\nand surjective morphisms of the categories ZLC and HLC and their subcategories,\ndiscussed in [4, 5, 6] and in the previous section here, by means of some properties of their dual morphisms. Such a problem was regarded by M. Stone in [18]\nfor the morphisms of the category ZLC (for surjective morphisms) and of the category PZLC (for injective morphisms), and by de Vries in [2] for the morphisms\nof the category HC of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps. We will\ngeneralize their results. An analogous problem will be investigated for the homeomorphic embeddings, LCA-embeddings and the morphisms of the categories dual\nto the mentioned above. Our result about LCA-embeddings (see Theorem 3.31)\ngeneralizes a theorem of Fedorchuk [8, Theorem 6]. Obviously, in all categories regarded here the injective morphisms are monomorphisms and surjective morphisms\nare epimorphisms. It is clear that surjectivity characterizes epimorphisms in the\ncategories HC and ZHC, and injectivity characterizes the monomorphisms in the\ncategories HLC, ZLC, PLC and PZLC. For the other categories regarded here I\nhave no characterization of the monomorphisms and epimorphisms. The things are\nnot simple as shows the following assertion:\nProposition 3.1 The closed irreducible maps are monomorphisms in the category\nof all Hausdorff spaces and quasi-open maps between them.\nProof. Note first that every closed irreducible map is quasi-open (see [15]). Let\nnow X, Y, Z be Hausdorff spaces, f : Y \u2212\u2192 Z be a closed irreducible map and\nh, k : X \u2212\u2192 Y be two quasi-open maps such that f \u25e6 h = f \u25e6 k. Suppose that\nthere exists x \u2208 X such that h(x) 6= k(x). Then there exist disjoint open sets U\nand V in Y such that h(x) \u2208 U and k(x) \u2208 V . Let W = h\u22121 (U) \u2229 k \u22121 (V ). Then\nx \u2208 W , h(W ) \u2286 U and k(W ) \u2286 V . Set O = int(h(W )). Since h is quasi-open,\nwe get that O 6= \u2205. Let F = Y \\ O. Then F is a closed proper subset of Y . We\nwill show that f (F ) = Y which will be a contradiction. We have that f (O) =\nf (int(h(W ))) \u2286 f (h(W )) = f (k(W )) \u2286 f (V ) \u2286 f (F ). Now, the surjectivity of f\nimplies that f (F ) = Y .\n13\n\n\fWe start with some simple observations.\nProposition 3.2 Let f \u2208 HLC(X, Y ), (A, \u03c1, IB) = \u039bt (X), (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) = \u039bt (Y ) and\n\u03c6 = \u039bt (f ). Then \u03c6 is an injection \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c6|IB\u2032 is an injection \u21d0\u21d2 clY (f (X)) = Y .\nProof. We have that \u03c6 : RC(Y ) \u2212\u2192 RC(X).\nObviously, if \u03c6 is an injection then \u03c6|IB\u2032 is an injection.\nLet \u03c6|IB\u2032 be an injection, G \u2208 CR(Y ) and G 6= \u2205. Then \u03c6(G) 6= \u2205, i.e.\n\u22121\nf (int(G)) 6= \u2205. This means that f (X) \u2229 int(G) 6= \u2205. Thus cl(f (X)) = Y .\nFinally, let cl(f (X)) = Y , G, H \u2208 RC(Y ), G 6= H and \u03c6(G) = \u03c6(H).\nThen, by the continuity of f , clY (f (clX (f \u22121 (intY (G))))) = clY (f ((f \u22121 (intY (G)))) =\nclY (f (X) \u2229 intY (G)) = G and, analogously, clY (f (clX (f \u22121 (intY (H))))) = H. Hence\nG = H, a contradiction. So, \u03c6 is an injection.\nA simplified version of the above proof shows that the following assertion takes\nplace:\nProposition 3.3 Let f \u2208 ZLC(X, Y ), (A, I) = \u0398t (X), (B, J) = \u0398t (Y ) and \u03c6 =\n\u0398t (f ). Then \u03c6 is an injection \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c6|J is an injection \u21d0\u21d2 clY (f (X)) = Y .\nProposition 3.4 Let f \u2208 ZLC(X, Y ), \u03c6 = \u0398t (f ), (A, I) = \u0398t (X), (B, J) = \u0398t (Y )\nand \u03c6(B) \u2287 I (or \u03c6(J) \u2287 I). Then f is an injection.\nProof. Suppose that there exist x, y \u2208 X such that x 6= y and\nthere exists U \u2208 CK(X) such that x \u2208 U \u2286 X \\ {y}. There\nwith \u03c6(V ) = U, i.e. f \u22121 (V ) = U. Then f (U) = f (X) \u2229 V and\nX \u2229 f \u22121 (V ) = U. Since f (y) = f (x) \u2208 f (U), we get that y \u2208\nThus, f is an injection.\n\nf (x) = f (y). Then\nexists V \u2208 CO(Y )\nhence f \u22121 (f (U)) =\nU, a contradiction.\n\nWe proceed with the investigation of the problem in the category ZLC and\nits subcategories.\nTheorem 3.5 Let f \u2208 ZLC(X, Y ), \u03c6 = \u0398t (f ), (A, I) = \u0398t (X) and (B, J) =\n\u0398t (Y ). Then f is an injection iff \u03c6 : (B, J) \u2212\u2192 (A, I) satisfies the following\ncondition:\n(InZLC) For any a, b \u2208 I such that a \u2227 b = 0 there exists a\u2032 , b\u2032 \u2208 J with a\u2032 \u2227 b\u2032 = 0,\n\u03c6(a\u2032 ) \u2265 a and \u03c6(b\u2032 ) \u2265 b.\nProof. Let f : X \u2212\u2192 Y be an injection. We have that (A, I) = (CO(X), CK(X)),\n(B, J) = (CO(Y ), CK(Y )) and \u03c6 : CO(Y ) \u2212\u2192 CO(X), G 7\u2192 f \u22121 (G). Let F1 , F2 \u2208\nCK(X) and F1 \u2229 F2 = \u2205. Since f is a continuous injection, we get that f (F1 ) and\nf (F2 ) are disjoint compact subsets of Y . Using the fact that CK(Y ) is a base of\nY , we get that there exist disjoint G1 , G2 \u2208 CK(Y ) such that f (Fi ) \u2286 Gi , i = 1, 2.\nThen Fi \u2286 f \u22121 (Gi ), i.e. Fi \u2286 \u03c6(Gi ), i = 1, 2. Hence, \u03c6 satisfies condition (InZLC).\nLet now \u03c6 satisfies condition (InZLC). We will prove that f is an injection.\nLet x, y \u2208 X and x 6= y. Then there exist disjoint Fx , Fy \u2208 CR(X) such that x \u2208 Fx\n14\n\n\fand y \u2208 Fy . Now, by condition (InZLC), there exist Gx , Gy \u2208 CR(Y ) such that\nGx \u2229 Gy = \u2205, f \u22121 (Gx ) \u2287 Fx and f \u22121 (Gy ) \u2287 Fy . Then f (x) \u2208 Gx and f (y) \u2208 Gy .\nThus f (x) 6= f (y).\nCorollary 3.6 The cofull subcategory InZLC of the category ZLC whose morphisms are, in addition, injective maps, is dually equivalent to the cofull subcategory\nDInZLC of the category ZLBA whose morphism satisfy, in addition, condition\n(InZLC).\nProof. It follows from Theorems 3.5 and 1.16.\nIn the sequel, we will not formulate corollaries like that because they follow\ndirectly from the respective characterization of injectivity or surjectivity and the corresponding duality theorem.\nRemark 3.7 Let us show how Theorem 3.5 implies Proposition 3.3. So, let \u03c6(B) \u2287\nI. Then \u03c6(J) \u2287 I. Indeed, let a \u2208 I; then, by condition (ZLBA), there exists\nb1 \u2208 J such that \u03c6(b1 ) \u2265 a; since there exists b2 \u2208 B with \u03c6(b2 ) = a, we get that\n\u03c6(b1 \u2227b2 ) = a and b1 \u2227b2 \u2208 J. Hence, \u03c6(J) \u2287 I. Let now a, b \u2208 I and a\u2227b = 0. There\nexist a1 , b1 \u2208 J such that \u03c6(a1 ) = a and \u03c6(b1 ) = b. Then \u03c6(a1 \u2227 b\u22171 ) = a \u2227 b\u2217 = a,\na1 \u2227 b\u22171 \u2208 J and (a1 \u2227 b\u22171 ) \u2227 b1 = 0. Therefore, \u03c6 satisfies condition (InZLC).\nIn the next theorem we will assume that the ideals and prime ideals could be\nnon-proper.\nTheorem 3.8 Let f \u2208 ZLC(X, Y ), \u03c6 = \u0398t (f ), (A, I) = \u0398t (X) and (B, J) =\n\u0398t (Y ). Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n(a) f is a surjection;\n(b) \u03c6 : (B, J) \u2212\u2192 (A, I) is an injection and for every bounded ultrafilter v in (B, J)\nthere exists a \u2208 I such that a \u2227 \u03c6(v) 6= 0 (i.e. a \u2227 \u03c6(b) 6= 0 for any b \u2208 v);\n(c) \u03c6W: (B, J) \u2212\u2192 (A, I) is an injection and for every prime ideal J1 of J, we have\nthat {I\u03c6(b) | b \u2208 J1 } = I implies J1 = J (where I\u03c6(b) = {a \u2208 I | a \u2264 \u03c6(b)});\nW\n(d) \u03c6 : (B, J) \u2212\u2192 (A, I) is an injection and for every ideal J1 of J, [( {I\u03c6(b) | b \u2208\nJ1 } = I) \u2192 (J1 = J)].\nProof. (a)\u21d2(b) Let f (X) = Y . Then, for every G \u2208 CO(Y ), f \u22121 (G) = \u2205 iff G = \u2205.\nThis means that for every G \u2208 CO(Y ), \u03c6(G) = 0 iff G = 0. Hence, \u03c6 is an injection.\nFurther, the bounded ultrafilters in (B, J) = (CO(Y ), CK(Y )) are of the form \u03c3yC\n(see 1.13 for this notation) and analogously for (A, I). So, let y \u2208 Y . Then there\nexists x \u2208 X such that f (x) = y. This implies that \u03c6(\u03c3yC ) \u2286 \u03c3xC . There exists\nF \u2208 CK(X) \u2229 \u03c3xC . Then F \u2229 f \u22121 (G) 6= \u2205, for every G \u2208 \u03c3yC , i.e. F \u2227 \u03c6(\u03c3yC ) 6= 0.\nW\n(b)\u21d2(c) Let J1 be a prime ideal of J. Let {I\u03c6(b) | b \u2208 J1 } = I. Suppose that\nJ1 6= J. Then v1 = {b \u2208 B | b \u2227 (J \\ J1 ) 6= 0} is a bounded ultrafilter in (B, J) and\n15\n\n\fv1 \u2229 J = J \\ J1 (indeed, apply [5, Proposition 3.6] to the LCA (B, \u03c1s , J)). By (b),\nthere exists a \u2208 I such that a \u2227 \u03c6(v1 ) 6= 0. Since\nW a \u2208 I, there exist b1 , . . . , bk \u2208 J1\n+\nand a1 , . . . , ak \u2208 I (where\nW k \u2208 N ) such that a = {ai | i = 1, . . . , k} and ai \u2264 \u03c6(bi ),\ni = 1, . . . , k. Set b = {bi | i = 1, . . . , k}. Then a \u2264 \u03c6(b) and b \u2208 J1 . Since \u03c6 is an\ninjection, we have that \u03c6(v1 \u2229 J) = \u03c6(J \\ J1 ) = \u03c6(J) \\ \u03c6(J1). Thus \u03c6(b) 6\u2208 \u03c6(v1 \u2229 J)\n(because b \u2208 J1 ). Since a \u2264 \u03c6(b), we get that \u03c6(b) \u2227 \u03c6(v1 ) 6= 0. The injectivity\nof \u03c6 implies that b \u2227 v1 6= 0. Thus b \u2208 v1 \u2229 J1 . Therefore, \u03c6(b) \u2208 \u03c6(v1 \u2229 J1 ), a\ncontradiction. Hence, J1 = J.\n(c)\u21d2(a) Suppose that f (X) 6= Y . Then there exists y \u2208 Y \\ f (X). Set U = Y \\ {y}.\nThus f (X) \u2286 U. Set J1 = {G \u2208 CK(Y ) | G \u2286 U}. Then J1 is a prime ideal of\nJ(= CK(Y )). (Indeed, if G1 , G2 \u2208 CK(Y ) and y 6\u2208 G1 \u2229 G2 then either y 6\u2208 G1\nor y W\n\u2208 G2 ; hence, G1 \u2208 J1 or G2 \u2208 J1 .) Obviously, J1 6= J. We will prove\nthat {I\u03c6(b) | b \u2208 J1 } = I, which, by (c), will lead to a contradiction. So, let\nF \u2208 CK(X). Then f (F ) \u2286 U. Since f (F ) is compact, there exists G \u2208 CK(Y )\nsuch that fW\n(F ) \u2286 G \u2286 U. Then G \u2208 J1 and F \u2286 f \u22121 (G) = \u03c6(G). Thus F \u2208 I\u03c6(G) .\nTherefore, {I\u03c6(b) | b \u2208 J1 } = I. So, f (X) = Y .\n(a)\u21d2(d) Let f (X) = Y . Then, as we have already\nproved (see (a)\u21d2(b)), \u03c6 is\nW\nan injection. Let J1 be S\nan ideal of J such that {I\u03c6(b) | b \u2208 J1 } = I. Suppose\nthat J1 6= J. Set U = {G | G \u2208 J1 }. Then U 6= Y . (Indeed, if U = Y then\nevery H \u2208 CK(Y )(= J) will be covered by a finite number of elements of J1 ;\nsince J1 is an ideal, we will get that H \u2208 J1 .) Since f is a surjection, we get that\nV = f \u22121 (U) 6= X. Set IV = {F \u2208 I | F \u2286 V }. Then, obviously, IV is a proper ideal\n\u22121\n\u22121\nof\nW I. Let G \u2208 J1 and F \u2208 I\u03c6(G) . Then F \u2286 \u03c6(G) = f (G) \u2286 f (U) = V . Thus\n{I\u03c6(b) | b \u2208 J1 } \u2286 IV . Since IV 6= I, we get a contradiction. Therefore, J1 = J.\n(d)\u21d2(c) It is obvious.\nRemark 3.9 In [18, Theorem 7] M. Stone proved a result which is equivalent to our\nassertion that (a)\u21d4(d) in the previous theorem. More precisely, M. Stone proved the\nfollowing (in our notations): the map f is a surjection iff the mapW\u03c8 = \u03c6|J : J \u2212\u2192 A\nis a 0-pseudolattice monomorphism and for every ideal JW1 of J, [( {I\u03c6(b) | b \u2208 J1 } =\nI)W\u2194 (J1 = J)]. The Stone's condition \"(J1 = J) \u2192 ( {I\u03c6(b) | b \u2208 J1 } = I)\", i.e.\n\" {I\u03c6(b) | b \u2208 J} = I\", is equivalent (as it is easy to see) to our condition (ZLBA)\n(see 1.14) which is automatically satisfied by the morphisms of the category ZLBA\nand thus it appears in our Theorem 3.8 in another form. Further, when \u03c6 is an\ninjection then, obviously, \u03c8 = \u03c6|J is an injection; in the converse direction we have\nthe following: the map \u03c8 can be extended to a homomorphism \u03c6 : B \u2212\u2192 A (by the\nresult proved below) and then \u03c6 is obliged to be an injection (indeed, if b \u2208 B \\ {0}\nand \u03c6(b) = 0 then the density of J in B implies that there exists c \u2208 J \\{0} such that\nc \u2264 b; then \u03c8(c) = \u03c6(c) = 0, a contradiction). So, our condition (d) is equivalent to\nthe cited above Stone condition from [18, Theorem 7].\n\n16\n\n\fProposition 3.10 Let (A, I) and (B, J) be ZLBAs and \u03c8 : J \u2212\u2192 A be a 0pseudolattice homomorphism satisfying condition (ZLBA). Then \u03c8 can be extended\nto a homomorphic map \u03c6 : B \u2212\u2192 A.\nProof. For every a \u2208 A and every b \u2208 B set Ia = {c \u2208 I | c \u2264 a} and Jb = {c \u2208\nJ | c \u2264 b}. It is easy to see that Ia and Jb are simple ideals of I and J respectively.\nNote also that \u00acIa = Ia\u2217 and analogously for Jb .\nW\nLet b \u2208WB. Since J is dense in B, we have that b = Jb . We will show\nthat\nS I(b) = {I\u03c8(c) | c \u2208 Jb } is a simple ideal of I. It is easy to see that I(b) =\n{I\u03c8(c) | c \u2208 Jb }. Let now a \u2208 I. Then, by condition (ZLBA), there exists c \u2208 J\nsuch that a \u2264 \u03c8(c). We have that c = (c \u2227 b) \u2228 (c \u2227 b\u2217 ), c1 = c \u2227 b \u2208 Jb , c2 =\nc \u2227 b\u2217 \u2208 \u00acJb and c = c1 \u2228 c2 . Thus a \u2264 \u03c8(c) = \u03c8(c1 ) \u2228 \u03c8(c2 ). We obtain that\na = a1 \u2228 a2 , where a1 = a \u2227 \u03c8(c1 ) and a2 = a \u2227 \u03c8(c2 ). Obviously, a1 \u2208 I(b). We\nwill show that a2 \u2208 \u00acI(b). Indeed, let a\u2032 \u2208 I(b); then there exists d \u2208 Jb such that\na\u2032 \u2264 \u03c8(d). Since c2 \u2208 \u00acJb , we get that d \u2227 c2 = 0. Thus \u03c8(d) \u2227 \u03c8(c2 ) = 0. Hence\na\u2032 \u2227a2 \u2264 \u03c8(d) \u2227a\u2227\u03c8(c2 ) = 0. Therefore, for every a\u2032 \u2208 I(b) we have that a2 \u2227a\u2032 = 0.\nThis means that a2 \u2208 \u00acI(b). Therefore,\nW I(b) \u2228 \u00acI(b) = I, i.e. I(b) is a simpleWideal.\nSince (A, I) is a ZLBA, we get that WI(b) exists in A. We set now\nS \u03c6(b) = I(b).\nObviously, \u03c6(0) = 0. Further, \u03c6(1) = I(1). We have that I(1) = {I\u03c8(c) | c \u2208 J}.\nApplying condition (ZLBA), we get that I(1) = I. Now, using the density of I in\nA, we obtain that \u03c6(1) = 1. Finally, the fact that \u03c6 preserves finite meets and\njoins can be easily proved. Hence \u03c6 : B \u2212\u2192 A is a Boolean homomorphism and the\n.\ndefinition of \u03c6 together with the density of I in A imply that \u03c6 extends \u03c8.\nRemark 3.11 Note that 3.9 and 3.10 imply that in Theorem 3.8 we can obtain\nnew conditions equivalent to the condition (a) by replacing in (b), (c) and (d) the\nphrase \"\u03c6 is an injection\" by the phrase \"\u03c6|J is an injection\".\nTheorem 3.12 Let f \u2208 OZLC(X, Y ), \u03c6 = \u0398t (f ), (A, I) = \u0398t (X) and (B, J) =\n\u0398t (Y ). Then f is an injection \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c6(J) \u2287 I \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c6(B) \u2287 I.\nProof. Note that, by Remark 3.7, conditions \"\u03c6(J) \u2287 I\" and \"\u03c6(B) \u2287 I\" are\nequivalent.\nLet f be an injection and F \u2208 CK(X). Then f (F ) \u2208 CK(Y ) and f \u22121 (f (F )) =\nF . Hence, \u03c6(J) \u2287 I. Conversely, let \u03c6(J) \u2287 I. Then, by 3.4, we get that f is an\ninjection.\nTheorem 3.13 Let f \u2208 PZLC(X, Y ), \u03c6 = \u0398t (f ), (A, I) = \u0398t (X) and (B, J) =\n\u0398t (Y ). Then f is a surjection \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c6 is an injection \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c6|J is an injection.\nProof. Clearly, Proposition 3.3 implies that if f is a surjection then \u03c6 is an injection.\nHence \u03c6|J is an injection.\nLet now \u03c6|J be an injection. Then, by Proposition 3.3, cl(f (X)) = Y . Since\nf is a closed map, we get that f is a surjection.\n17\n\n\fTheorem 3.14 Let f \u2208 PZLC(X, Y ), \u03c6 = \u0398t (f ), (A, I) = \u0398t (X) and (B, J) =\n\u0398t (Y ). Then f is an injection iff \u03c6(J) = I.\nProof. Let f be an injection. Then f\u21beX : X \u2212\u2192 f (X) is a homeomorphism. Let\nF \u2032 \u2208 CK(X). Then F = f (F \u2032 ) is compact. Since F is open in f (X), there exists an\nopen set U in Y such that U \u2229 f (X) = F . Then there exists G \u2208 CK(Y ) such that\nF \u2286 G \u2286 U. Then, clearly, f \u22121 (G) = f \u22121 (F ) = F \u2032 . Hence \u03c6(G) = F \u2032 . Therefore,\n\u03c6(J) \u2287 I. Since f is perfect, we have that \u03c6(J) \u2286 I. Thus \u03c6(J) = I. Conversely,\nlet \u03c6(J) = I. Then Proposition 3.4 implies that f is an injection.\nObviously, the last two theorems imply the well-known Stone's results that a\nZHC-morphism f is an injection (resp., a surjection) iff \u03c6 = S t (f ) is a surjection\n(resp., an injection).\nNow we turn to the morphisms of the category HLC and its subcategories\ndiscussed in [4, 5].\nTheorem 3.15 Let f \u2208 HLC(X, Y ), (A, \u03c1, IB) = \u039bt (X), (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) = \u039bt (Y ) and\n\u03c6 = \u039bt (f ). Then f is a surjection iff \u03c6 : (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) \u2212\u2192 (A, \u03c1, IB) satisfies the\nfollowing condition:\n(SuHLC) For any bounded ultrafilter v in (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) there exists a bounded ultrafilter\nu in (A, \u03c1, IB) such that \u2200b \u2208 IB\u2032 , (b\u03b7v) \u2194 ((\u2200b\u2032 \u2208 IB\u2032 )[(b \u226a\u03b7 b\u2032 ) \u2192 (\u03c6(b\u2032 )\u03c1u)]).\nProof. Let f be a surjection and v be a bounded ultrafilter\nin (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ). Recall\nT\n\u2032\nthat that\nT (B, \u03b7, IB ) = (RC(Y ), \u03c1Y , CR(Y )). Obviously, v is an one-point set. Let\n{y} = v. Since f is a surjection, there exists x \u2208 X such that f (x) = y. Let\n\u03c3x = {F \u2208 RC(X) | x \u2208 F } and \u03bdx = {F \u2208 RC(X) | x \u2208 int(F )}. There exists\nan ultrafilter\nu in (A, \u03c1, IB) such that u \u2287 \u03bdx . Then it is easy to see that u \u2286 \u03c3x .\nT\nHence u = {x}. Let now G, H \u2208 CR(Y ). Clearly, if y \u2208 G then G\u03c1Y v (i.e. G\u03b7v).\nConversely, let G\u03c1Y v. If y 6\u2208 G then, by [7, Corollary 3.1.5], there exists G\u2032 \u2208 v such\nthat G \u2229 G\u2032 = \u2205, a contradiction. Hence, G\u03c1Y v iff y \u2208 G. In an analogous way we\nobtain that cl(f \u22121 (int(H)))\u03c1X u iff x \u2208 cl(f \u22121 (int(H))). So, we have to show that\ny \u2208 G iff for all H \u2208 CR(Y ), (G \u2286 int(H)) \u2192 (x \u2208 cl(f \u22121 (int(H)))). Let y \u2208 G and\nG \u2286 int(H) for some H \u2208 CR(Y ). Then cl(f \u22121 (int(H))) \u2287 f \u22121 (G) \u2287 f \u22121 (y) and\nthus x \u2208 cl(f \u22121 (int(H))). Conversely, let x \u2208 cl(f \u22121 (int(H))) for every H \u2208 CR(Y )\nsuch that G \u2286 int(H). Suppose that y 6\u2208 G. Then there exists H \u2208 CR(Y ) such\nthat G \u2286 int(H) \u2286 H \u2286 Y \\ {y}. Then cl(f \u22121 (int(H))) \u2286 f \u22121 (H) \u2286 X \\ f \u22121 (y).\nThus x 6\u2208 cl(f \u22121 (int(H))), a contradiction. So, \u03c6 satisfies condition (SuHLC).\nLet now \u03c6 satisfies condition (SuHLC). We will show that f \u2032 = \u039ba (\u03c6) is a\nsurjection. This will imply that f is a surjection. Let \u03c3 \u2032 \u2208 Y \u2032 = \u039ba (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ).\nThen there exists a bounded ultrafilter v in (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) such that \u03c3 \u2032 = \u03c3v (see [4]).\nBy condition (SuHLC), there exists a bounded ultrafilter u in (A, \u03c1, IB) such that\n\u2200b \u2208 IB\u2032 , (b\u03b7v) \u2194 ((\u2200b\u2032 \u2208 IB\u2032 )[(b \u226a\u03b7 b\u2032 ) \u2192 (\u03c6(b\u2032 )\u03c1u)]). Then it is easy to see\nthat f \u2032 (\u03c3u ) = \u03c3v (see Theorem 1.2 for the definition of the map f \u2032 ). Hence, f \u2032 is a\nsurjection.\n18\n\n\fTheorem 3.16 Let f \u2208 HLC(X, Y ), (A, \u03c1, IB) = \u039bt (X), (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) = \u039bt (Y ) and\n\u03c6 = \u039bt (f ). Then f is an injection iff \u03c6 : (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) \u2212\u2192 (A, \u03c1, IB) satisfies the\nfollowing condition:\n(InHLC) For any a, b \u2208 IB, a(\u2212\u03c1)b implies that there exist c, d \u2208 IB\u2032 such that\nc \u226a\u03b7 d, a \u2264 \u03c6(c) and \u03c6(d)(\u2212\u03c1)b.\nProof. Let f be an injection. We will show that \u03c6 satisfies condition (InHLC). Let\nF, G \u2208 CR(X) and F \u2229 G = \u2205. Since f is an injection, we get that f (F ) \u2229 f (G) =\n\u2205. Using the fact that f (F ) and f (G) are compact sets, we get that there exist\nF \u2032 , G\u2032 \u2208 CR(Y ) such that f (F ) \u2286 int(F \u2032 ) \u2286 F \u2032 \u2286 int(G\u2032 ) \u2286 G\u2032 \u2286 Y \\ f (G). Then,\nclearly, F \u2286 f \u22121 (int(F \u2032 )) \u2286 \u03c6(F \u2032) and G \u2229 \u03c6(G\u2032 ) = \u2205 (because \u03c6(G\u2032 ) \u2286 f \u22121 (G\u2032 ) and\nf \u22121 (G\u2032 ) \u2229 G = \u2205). Therefore, \u03c6 satisfies condition (InHLC).\nLet now \u03c6 satisfies condition (InHLC). We will prove that f is an injection.\nLet x, y \u2208 X and x 6= y. Then there exist disjoint Fx , Fy \u2208 CR(X) such that\nx \u2208 Fx and y \u2208 Fy . Now, by condition (InHLC), there exist Gx , Gy \u2208 CR(Y ) such\nthat Gx \u2286 int(Gy ), Fx \u2286 cl(f \u22121(int(Gx ))) and cl(f \u22121 (int(Gy ))) \u2229 Fy = \u2205. Since\nFx \u2286 f \u22121 (Gx ), we get that f (x) \u2208 Gx . Further, we have that Fy \u2229 f \u22121 (int(Gy )) = \u2205.\nThus f (Fy ) \u2229 int(Gy ) = \u2205. Then f (Fy ) \u2229 Gx = \u2205, and therefore, f (x) 6= f (y). Hence,\nf is an injection.\nThe next theorem was proved in [3, Theorem 2.11] using a theorem of de Vries\n[2]. We will give now a direct proof of it using only 3.2.\nTheorem 3.17 Let f \u2208 PLC(X, Y ) and \u03c6 = \u039bt (f ). Then f is a surjection iff \u03c6\nis an injection.\nProof. If f is a surjection then Proposition 3.2 implies that \u03c6 is an injection. Let\nnow \u03c6 be an injection. Then, by Proposition 3.2, cl(f (X)) = Y . Since f is a closed\nmap, we get that f is a surjection.\nObviously, Theorem 3.16 implies the following result:\nTheorem 3.18 Let f \u2208 PLC(X, Y ), (A, \u03c1, IB) = \u039bt (X), (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) = \u039bt (Y ) and\n\u03c6 = \u039bt (f ). Then f is an injection iff \u03c6 satisfies condition (InHLC) (see Theorem\n3.16).\nAnother characterization of the injective PLC-morphisms was given in [3,\nTheorem 2.15]. It was derived from a theorem of de Vries [2]. It seems that the new\ncondition looks better. In this form the theorem is new even in the compact case.\nTheorem 3.19 Let f \u2208 PZLC(X, Y ), f be a skeletal map, \u03c6 = \u039bt (f ) and f be an\ninjection. Then \u03c6 is a surjection.\nProof. Let \u03c6\u2032 = \u0398t (f ). Then, by Theorem 3.14, \u03c6\u2032 (CK(Y )) = CK(X). Since\nf is a skeletal map, [4, Theorem 2.11] (see also 1.5) implies that \u03c6 is a complete\n19\n\n\fhomomorphism. Let F \u2208SRC(X). Then, using the fact that CK(X)Wis a base of\nX, we get that int(F ) = {G \u2208 CK(X) | G \u2286 int(F )}. Thus F = RC(X) {G \u2208\nCK(X) | G \u2286 int(F )}. Further, for every G \u2208 CK(X)\nthere exists HG \u2208 CK(Y )\nW\n\u2032\nsuch that G = \u03c6 (HG ) = \u03c6(HG ). Therefore F = \u03c6( RC(Y ) {HG | G \u2208 CK(X), G \u2286\nint(F )}). This shows that \u03c6 is a surjection.\nRemark 3.20 It is well known that the following two assertions can be add in\nCorollary 2.5: \u03c6 is an injection iff \u03c8 is an injection, and also, if \u03c6 is a surjection\nthen \u03c8 is a surjection (see, e.g., [9, Ch. 25, Ex. 12]). Note that the first assertion\nfollows immediately from Theorems 3.13 and 3.17; the second follows from Theorems\n3.14 and 3.19.\nTheorem 3.21 Let f \u2208 SkeLC(X, Y ), (A, \u03c1, IB) = \u039bt (X)(= \u03a8t (X)), (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) =\n\u039bt (Y )(= \u03a8t (Y )) and \u03c6 = \u039bt (f )(= \u03a8t (f )). Then f is a surjection if and only if\n\u03c6 : (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) \u2212\u2192 (A, \u03c1, IB) satisfies the following condition:\n(SuSkeLC) For every bounded ultrafilter v in (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) there exists a bounded ultrafilter u in (A, \u03c1, IB) such that \u03c6\u22121 (u)\u03b7v.\nProof. Let f : X \u2212\u2192 Y be a surjective continuous skeletal map between two\nlocally compact Hausdorff spaces and \u03c6 = \u03a8t (f ). Then \u03c6 : RC(Y ) \u2212\u2192 RC(X) and\n\u03c6\u039b (F ) = cl(f (F )), for every F \u2208 RC(X) (see the proof of [4, Theorem 2.11]). Let\nv be a bounded ultrafilter\nin RC(Y ). Then there exists G0 \u2208 CR(Y ) \u2229 v. Hence\nT\nthere exists y \u2208 {G | G \u2208 v}. Since f is a surjection, there exists x \u2208 X such\nthat f (x) = y. Let u be an ultrafilter in RC(X) which contains \u03bdx (see [4, (3)]\nfor \u03bdx ). Then, obviously, u is a bounded ultrafilter in (RC(X), \u03c1X , CR(X)). By [4,\n(51)], u \u2286 \u03c3x (see [4, (3)] for \u03c3x ). Hence y \u2208 \u03c6\u039b (F ), for every F \u2208 u. This means\nthat \u03c6\u039b (u)\u03c1Y v. Since \u03c6\u039b (u) is a filter-base of \u03c6\u22121 (u) (see [4, (36)]), we get that\n\u03c6\u22121 (u)\u03c1Y v. Therefore, \u03c6 satisfies condition (SuSkeLC).\nLet \u03c6 satisfies condition (SuSkeLC). Set f \u2032 = \u03a8a (\u03c6). Let X \u2032 = \u03a8a (A, \u03c1, IB),\n\u2032\nY = \u03a8a (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) and \u03c3 \u2208 Y \u2032 . Then \u03c3 is a bounded cluster in (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ). Hence\nthere exists a bounded ultrafilter v in (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) such that \u03c3 = \u03c3v . By (SuSkeLC),\nthere exists a bounded ultrafilter u in (A, \u03c1, IB) such that \u03c6\u22121 (u)\u03b7v. Thus \u03c6\u22121 (u)C\u03b7 v.\nTherefore, by [4, (35)], f \u2032 (\u03c3u ) = \u03c3\u03c6\u039b (u) = \u03c3v = \u03c3. So, f \u2032 is a surjection. Then, by\n[4, Theorem 2.11], f is also a surjection.\nObviously, in condition (SuSkeLC), \"\u03c6\u22121 (u)\u03b7v\" can be replaced by \"\u03c6\u039b (u)\u03b7v\".\nNote that it is easy to see that condition (SuSkeLC) implies condition (SuHLC)\nwhen \u03c6 is a DSkeLC-morphism. This provides with a new proof the sufficiency\npart of Theorem 3.21.\nTheorem 3.22 Let f \u2208 SkeLC(X, Y ), (A, \u03c1, IB) = \u039bt (X)(= \u03a8t (X)), (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) =\n\u039bt (Y )(= \u03a8t (Y )) and \u03c6 = \u039bt (f )(= \u03a8t (f )). Then f is an injection if and only if\n\u03c6 : (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) \u2212\u2192 (A, \u03c1, IB) satisfies the following condition:\n(InSkeLC) \u2200a, b \u2208 IB, \u03c6\u039b (a)\u03b7\u03c6\u039b (b) implies a\u03c1b (here \u03c6\u039b is the left adjoint of \u03c6).\n20\n\n\fProof. Let f : X \u2212\u2192 Y be an injective continuous skeletal map. The function\n\u03c6\u039b : RC(X) \u2212\u2192 RC(Y ) is defined by \u03c6\u039b (F ) = cl(f (F )), for every F \u2208 RC(X) (see\n[4, (32) and (33)]). Hence, for F \u2208 CR(X), \u03c6\u039b (F ) = f (F ). Since f is an injection,\nit becomes obvious that \u03c6 satisfies condition (InSkeLC).\nLet \u03c6 satisfies condition (InSkeLC). We will show that f is an injection. Let\nx, y \u2208 X and x 6= y. Then there exist disjoint Fx , Fy \u2208 CR(X) such that x \u2208 Fx\nand y \u2208 Fy . If f (x) = f (y) then f (Fx ) \u2229 f (Fy ) 6= \u2205, i.e. \u03c6\u039b (Fx )\u03b7\u03c6\u039b (Fy ), and, hence,\nby (InSkeLC), Fx \u2229 Fy 6= \u2205, a contradiction. Thus, f (x) 6= f (y).\nAgain, it is easy to see that condition (InSkeLC) implies condition (InHLC)\nwhen \u03c6 is a DSkeLC-morphism.\nTheorem 3.23 Let f \u2208 OpLC(X, Y ), (A, \u03c1, IB) = \u039bt (X)(= \u03a8t (X)), (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) =\n\u039bt (Y )(= \u03a8t (Y )) and \u03c6 = \u039bt (f )(= \u03a8t (f )). Then f is an injection if and only if \u03c6\nis a surjection.\nProof. Let \u03c6 be a surjection. Let a, b \u2208 IB and \u03c6\u039b (a)\u03b7\u03c6\u039b (b). Then, by condition\n(LO) from [4], \u03c6(\u03c6\u039b (a))\u03c1b. Since surjectivity of \u03c6 implies that \u03c6(\u03c6\u039b (a)) = a (see\n[4, 1.21]), we get that a\u03c1b. Therefore, \u03c6 satisfies condition (InSkeLC). Hence, by\nTheorem 3.22, f is an injection.\nLet f : X \u2212\u2192 Y be an injective open map. Then \u03c6(G) = f \u22121 (G), for every\nG \u2208 RC(Y ) (see the proof of [4, Theorem 2.17]). For every F \u2208 RC(X) we have, by\n[4, Corollary 2.5] and [4, Lemma 2.6], that cl(f (F )) \u2208 RC(Y ). Set G = cl(f (F )).\nThen, by [7, 1.4.C], f \u22121 (G) = cl(f \u22121 (f (F ))) (because f is an open map), and the\ninjectivity of f implies that f \u22121 (G) = F . Hence \u03c6(G) = F . Therefore, \u03c6 is a\nsurjection.\nNow we will be occupied with the homeomorphic embeddings. We will call\nthem shortly embeddings.\nWe will need a lemma from [1]:\nLemma 3.24 Let X be a dense subspace of a topological space Y . Then the functions r : RC(Y ) \u2212\u2192 RC(X), F 7\u2192 F \u2229 X, and e : RC(X) \u2212\u2192 RC(Y ), G 7\u2192\nclY (G), are Boolean isomorphisms between Boolean algebras RC(X) and RC(Y ),\nand e \u25e6 r = idRC(Y ) , r \u25e6 e = idRC(X) .\nTheorem 3.25 Let f \u2208 HLC(X, Y ), (A, \u03c1, IB) = \u039bt (X), (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) = \u039bt (Y ) and\n\u03c6 = \u039bt (f ). Then f is a dense embedding iff \u03c6 is a Boolean isomorphism satisfying\nthe following condition:\n(LO') \u2200b \u2208 B and \u2200a \u2208 IB, \u03c6\u22121 (a)\u03b7b implies a\u03c1\u03c6(b).\nProof. Let f be a dense embedding of X in Y . Then f (X) is a locally compact\ndense subspace of Y and hence it is open in Y . Thus f is an open injection.\nTherefore, by [4, Theorem 2.17] and 1.5, \u03c6 is a complete homomorphism satisfying\ncondition (LO) from [4, Definition 2.16]. Put Z = f (X) and let i : Z \u2212\u2192 Y be\n21\n\n\fthe embedding of Z in Y . Then \u03c8 = \u039bt (i) : RC(Y ) \u2212\u2192 RC(Z) is defined by\nthe formula \u03c8(F ) = clZ (Z \u2229 intY (F )) = F \u2229 Z, for every F \u2208 RC(Y ). Hence, by\nLemma 3.24, \u03c8 is a Boolean isomorphism. Since f = i \u25e6 f\u21beX , we obtain that \u03c6 is\na Boolean isomorphism as well. Then \u03c6\u039b = \u03c6\u22121 and thus condition (LO) coincides\nwith condition (LO') (because the only one difference between the two conditions\nis that \u03c6\u22121 in (LO') is replaced with \u03c6\u039b in (LO)). So, \u03c6 is a Boolean isomorphism\nsatisfying condition (LO').\nConversely, let \u03c6 be a Boolean isomorphism satisfying condition (LO'). Then\n\u03c6 is a complete homomorphism satisfying condition (LO). Obviously, condition\n(DLC3S) (written here immediately after 1.1) implies condition (L1) from [4, Definition 2.10]. If a \u2208 IB then, by condition (DLC4) (see 1.1), there exists b \u2208 IB\u2032\nsuch that a \u2264 \u03c6(b). Then \u03c6\u039b (a) \u2264 b. Thus \u03c6\u039b (a) \u2208 IB\u2032 . Therefore, \u03c6 satisfies also\ncondition (L2) from [4, Definition 2.10]. Hence, \u03c6 is a DOpLC-morphism (see [4,\nDefinition 2.16]). Thus, by [4, Theorem 2.17], f is an open map. Since, by Theorem\n3.23, f is an injection, we get that f is an embedding. Finally, by Proposition 3.2,\nf (X) is dense in Y .\nRemark 3.26 Note that, in the notations of Theorem 3.25, f is a closed embedding\niff \u03c6 satisfies conditions (PAL5) (see 1.3) and (InHLC) (see 3.16); this follows from\nTheorems 1.4 and 3.16.\nProposition 3.27 Let f \u2208 HLC(X, Y ), (A, \u03c1, IB) = \u039bt (X), (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) = \u039bt (Y )\nand \u03c6 = \u039bt (f ). Then f is an embedding iff there exists a complete LCA (A1 , \u03c11 , IB1 )\nand DLC-morphisms \u03c61 : (A1 , \u03c11 , IB1 ) \u2212\u2192 (A, \u03c1, IB) and \u03c62 : (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) \u2212\u2192\n(A1 , \u03c11 , IB1 ) such that \u03c6 = \u03c61 \u25e6 \u03c62 , \u03c61 is a Boolean isomorphism satisfying condition (LO') and \u03c62 satisfies conditions (PAL5) and (InHLC).\nProof. Obviously, f is an embedding iff f = i \u25e6 f1 where f1 is a dense embedding\nand i is a closed embedding. (Indeed, when f is an embedding then let f1 : X \u2212\u2192\nclY (f (X)) be the restriction of f and i : clY (f (X)) \u2212\u2192 Y be the inclusion map; the\nconverse is also clear.) Setting \u03c61 = \u039bt (f1 ) and \u03c62 = \u039bt (i), we get, by Theorem 1.2,\nthat \u03c6 = \u03c61 \u25e6 \u03c62 . Now our assertion follows from 3.25 and 3.26.\nTheorem 3.28 Let f \u2208 ZLC(X, Y ), \u03c6 = \u0398t (f ), (A, I) = \u0398t (X) and (B, J) =\n\u0398t (Y ). Then f is a dense embedding iff \u03c6 is an injection and \u03c6(J) \u2287 I.\nProof. Let f be a dense embedding. Then f (X) is open in Y and thus f is an open\ninjection. Now, Theorem 3.12 implies that \u03c6(J) \u2287 I. Since cl(f (X)) = Y , we get,\nby 3.3, that \u03c6 is an injection.\nConversely, let \u03c6 be an injection and \u03c6(J) \u2287 I. Then, by 3.3, cl(f (X)) = Y .\nWe will show now that \u03c6 has a lower P-preadjoint. Indeed, for every a \u2208 I there\nexists a unique ba \u2208 J such that \u03c6(ba ) = a. Let \u03c8 : I \u2212\u2192 J be defined by \u03c8(a) = ba\nfor every a \u2208 I. Then, obviously, \u03c6(\u03c8(a)) = a, for every a \u2208 I. Thus condition\n22\n\n\f(OZL2) (see 2.8) is satisfied. Further, let a \u2208 I, b \u2208 J and a \u2227 \u03c6(b) = 0. Then\na = \u03c6(\u03c8(a)). Hence \u03c6(\u03c8(a)\u2227b) = 0. Since \u03c6 is an injection, we get that \u03c8(a)\u2227b = 0.\nSo, condition (OZL1) (see 2.8) is also satisfied. Therefore, \u03c8 is a lower P-preadjoint\nof \u03c6. Hence, by Theorem 2.8, f is an open map. Now, using the condition \u03c6(J) \u2287 I,\nwe get, by Theorem 3.12, that f is an injection. Hence, f is a dense embedding.\nTheorem 3.29 (M. Stone [18]) Let f \u2208 ZLC(X, Y ), \u03c6 = \u0398t (f ), (A, I) = \u0398t (X)\nand (B, J) = \u0398t (Y ). Then f is a closed embedding iff \u03c6(J) = I.\nProof. Let f be a closed embedding. Then f is a perfect injection. Hence, by\nTheorem 3.14, \u03c6(J) = I.\nConversely, let \u03c6(J) = I. Then, by Theorem 1.20, f is a perfect map. Using\nProposition 3.4, we get that f is an injection.\nProposition 3.30 Let f \u2208 ZLC(X, Y ), \u03c6 = \u0398t (f ), (A, I) = \u0398t (X) and (B, J) =\n\u0398t (Y ). Then f is an embedding iff there exists a ZLBA (A1 , I1 ) and two ZLBAmorphisms \u03c61 : (A1 , I1 ) \u2212\u2192 (A, I) and \u03c62 : (B, J) \u2212\u2192 (A1 , I1 ) such that \u03c6 = \u03c61 \u25e6\u03c62 ,\n\u03c61 is an injection, \u03c61 (I1 ) \u2287 I and \u03c62 (J) = I.\nProof. Arguing as in the proof of Proposition 3.27 and using Theorems 3.28 and\n3.29, we get the desired result.\nNow we will characterize LCA-embeddings for DSkeLC-morphisms. This will\nimply a generalization of a theorem of Fedorchuk [8, Theorem 6].\nRecall that a continuous mapping f : X \u2212\u2192 Y is said to be semi-open ([19])\nif for every point y \u2208 f (X) there exists a point x \u2208 f \u22121 (y) such that, for every\nM \u2286 X, x \u2208 intX (M) implies that y \u2208 intf (X) (f (M)).\nTheorem 3.31 Let f \u2208 SkeLC(Y, X). Then \u03c6 = \u039bt (f )(= \u03a8t (f )) is an LCAembedding iff f is a semi-open perfect surjection.\nProof. Note that, by Theorem [4, Theorem 2.11], \u03c6 is a complete Boolean homomorphism. Recall also that when our map f is closed then it is quasi-open (see [4,\nCorollary 2.5(b)]).\nLet (A, \u03c1, IB) = \u039bt (X) and (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) = \u039bt (Y ). Then \u03c6 : (A, \u03c1, IB) \u2212\u2192\n(B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ). Set C = C\u03c1 and C \u2032 = C\u03b7 (see [4, 1.16] for the notations). Then,\nby [4, 1.16], (A, C) and (B, C \u2032 ) are CNCA's. By the proof of Theorem [4, 2.1],\nA\nB\n\u03a8a (A, C) = \u03b1X = X \u222a {\u03c3\u221e\n} and \u03a8a (B, C \u2032 ) = \u03b1Y = Y \u222a {\u03c3\u221e\n}.\nLet \u03c6 be an LCA-embedding, i.e. \u03c6 : A \u2212\u2192 B is a Boolean embedding\nsuch that, for any a, b \u2208 A, a\u03c1b iff \u03c6(a)\u03b7\u03c6(b), and a \u2208 IB iff \u03c6(a) \u2208 IB\u2032 ; hence\n\u03c6 satisfies condition (PAL5) (see 1.3). Then, by Theorems 3.17 and 1.4, f is a\nperfect surjection. It remains to show that f is semi-open. Denote by \u03c6c the map\n\u03c6 regarded as a function from (A, C) to (B, C \u2032 ). By [4, (55)], \u03c6c satisfies condition\n(F1) from [4, 2.12]. We will show that \u03c6c is an NCA-embedding. Indeed, for any\n23\n\n\fa, b \u2208 A, we have that aCb iff a\u03c1b or a, b 6\u2208 IB; since \u03c6 is an LCA-embedding,\nwe obtain that aCb iff \u03c6c (a)C \u2032 \u03c6c (b). So, \u03c6c is an NCA-embedding and a DSkeCmorphism (see [4, Definition 2.12]). Then, by Theorem 6 of Fedorchuk's paper [8],\nfc = \u03a8a (\u03c6c ) : \u03b1Y \u2212\u2192 \u03b1X is a semi-open map. If 1A 6\u2208 IB and 1B 6\u2208 IB\u2032 then\nA\nB\nfc\u22121 (\u03c3\u221e\n) = {\u03c3\u221e\n} (see the proof of [4, Theorem 2.15]) and since f = (fc )|Y , we\nobtain that f is semi-open. Further, if 1A \u2208 IB and 1B \u2208 IB\u2032 then the fact that f is\nsemi-open is obvious. Since only these two cases are possible in the given situation,\nwe have proved that f is a perfect quasi-open semi-open surjection.\nConversely, let f be a perfect semi-open surjection. Then, by Theorem 3.17,\n\u03c6 is an injection. Hence \u03c6\u039b \u25e6 \u03c6 = idA . Thus, if \u03c6(a) \u2208 IB\u2032 then, by (L2) (see\n[4, Definition 2.10]) (which follows from (DLC4)), a = \u03c6\u039b (\u03c6(a)) \u2208 IB. Since f\nis perfect, Theorem 1.4 implies that \u03c6 satisfies condition (PLC5). Using it, we\nobtain that a \u2208 IB iff \u03c6(a) \u2208 IB\u2032 . Since (L1) takes place (see [4, 2.10 and 2.11]),\nit remains only to prove that a\u03c1b implies \u03c6(a)\u03b7\u03c6(b), for all a, b \u2208 A. Let F, G \u2208\nRC(X), F \u2229 G 6= \u2205 and x \u2208 F \u2229 G. Set U = int(F ) and V = int(G). Then\nx \u2208 cl(U) \u2229 cl(V ). Since f is a semi-open surjection, there exists y \u2208 f \u22121 (x) such\nthat, for every M \u2286 Y , y \u2208 intY (M) implies that x \u2208 intX (f (M)). We will show\nthat y \u2208 cl(f \u22121 (U)) \u2229 cl(f \u22121 (V )). Indeed, suppose that y 6\u2208 cl(f \u22121 (U)). Then\nthere exists an open neighborhood Oy of y such that Oy \u2229 f \u22121 (U) = \u2205. Thus\nf (Oy) \u2229 U = \u2205. Since x \u2208 cl(U) and x \u2208 int(f (Oy)), we obtain a contradiction.\nHence y \u2208 cl(f \u22121 (U)). Analogously we show that y \u2208 cl(f \u22121 (V )). Therefore,\ny \u2208 cl(f \u22121 (U)) \u2229 cl(f \u22121 (V )) = \u03c6(F ) \u2229 \u03c6(G). So, we get that a\u03c1b implies \u03c6(a)\u03b7\u03c6(b).\nTherefore, \u03c6 is an LCA-embedding.\n\n4\n\nOpen sets. Regular closed sets\n\nWe will first recall some definitions and results from [5].\nDefinition 4.1 [5] Let (A, \u03c1, IB) be an LCA. An ideal I of A is called a \u03b4-ideal if\nI \u2286 IB and for any a \u2208 I there exists b \u2208 I such that a \u226a\u03c1 b. If I1 and I2 are two \u03b4ideals of (A, \u03c1, IB) then we put I1 \u2264 I2 iff I1 \u2286 I2 . We will denote by (I(A, \u03c1, IB), \u2264)\nthe poset of all \u03b4-ideals of (A, \u03c1, IB).\nNote that I is a \u03b4-ideal of (A, \u03c1s , IB) iff it is an ideal of IB (see 1.7 for \u03c1s ).\nFact 4.2 [5] Let (A, \u03c1, IB) be an LCA. Then, for every a \u2208 A, the set {b \u2208 IB | b \u226a\u03c1\na} is a \u03b4-ideal.\nThe \u03b4-ideals regarded in Fact 4.2 will be called A-principal \u03b4-ideals or, when\na \u2208 IB, principal \u03b4-ideals. Note that the letter \"A\" coincides with the letter with\nwhich is denoted the Boolean algebra in the LCA (A, \u03c1, IB); thus, if we start with\nan LCA (B, \u03c1, IB), then this kind of \u03b4-ideals will be called \"B-principal \u03b4-ideals\"\ninstead of \"A-principal \u03b4-ideals\". In particular case, when \u03c1 = \u03c1s (see 1.7 for \u03c1s ),\nwe obtain the notion of A-principal ideal (see 4.1).\n24\n\n\fRecall\nW that\nW a frame is a complete lattice L satisfying the infinite distributive\nlaw a \u2227 S = {a \u2227 s | s \u2208 S}, for every a \u2208 L and every S \u2286 L.\nFact 4.3 [5] Let (A, \u03c1, IB) be an LCA. Then the poset (I(A, \u03c1, IB), \u2264) of all \u03b4-ideals\nof (A, \u03c1, IB) (see 4.1) is a frame.\nTheorem 4.4 [5] Let (A, \u03c1, IB) be an LCA, X = \u03a8a (A, \u03c1, IB) and O(X) be the frame\nof all open subsets of X. Then there exists a frame isomorphism\n\u03b9 : (I(A, \u03c1, IB), \u2264) \u2212\u2192 (O(X), \u2286),\nwhere (I(A, \u03c1, IB), \u2264) is the frame of all \u03b4-ideals of (A, \u03c1, IB). The isomorphism\n\u03b9 sends the set P I(A, \u03c1, IB) of all A-principal \u03b4-ideals of (A, \u03c1, IB) onto the set of\nthose regular open subsets of X whose complements are in \u03bbgA (A). In particular, if\n(A, \u03c1, IB) is a CLCA, then \u03b9(P I(A, \u03c1, IB)) = RO(X).\nIn analogy with Stone's terminology from [17, 18], a \u03b4-ideal J of an LCA\n(A, \u03c1, IB) will be called a simple \u03b4-ideal if it has a complement in the frame I(A, \u03c1, IB),\ni.e. if J \u2228 \u00acJ = IB (here \u00acJ is the pseudocomplement of J in the frame I(A, \u03c1, IB)).\n(see 4.1 for the notations); also, the regular elements of the frame I(A, \u03c1, IB) (i.e.\nthose J \u2208 I(A, \u03c1, IB) for which \u00ac\u00acJ = J) will be called normal \u03b4-ideals.\nCorollary 4.5 Let (A, \u03c1, IB) be a CLCA, (X, O) = \u039ba (A, \u03c1, IB), J be a \u03b4-ideal of\n(A, \u03c1, IB) and U = \u03b9(J) (see Theorem 4.4 for \u03b9). Then:\n(a) U is a clopen set iff J is a simple \u03b4-ideal of (A, \u03c1, IB);\n(b) U is a regular open set \u21d0\u21d2 J is a normal \u03b4-ideal of (A, \u03c1, IB) \u21d0\u21d2 J is an\nA-principal \u03b4-ideal;\n(c) U is a compact open set iff J is a principal ideal of IB.\nProof. Since the map \u03b9 is a frame isomorphism (see Theorem 4.4), it preserves and\nreflects the regular elements and the elements which have a complement. Note also\nthat the pseudocomplement \u00acU of U in the frame (O, \u2286) is the set int(X \\ U).\n(a) Clearly, U is a clopen set iff it has a complement in the frame (O, \u2286) iff J is a\nsimple \u03b4-ideal.\n(b) Obviously, U is a regular open set iff it is a regular element of the frame (O, \u2286).\nThus our assertion follows from the second statement in Theorem 4.4.\n(c) We have that U is a compact open set \u21d0\u21d2 U = \u03bbgA (a) for some a \u2208 IB such\nthat a \u226a\u03c1 a \u21d0\u21d2 U = \u03bbgA (a) for some a \u2208 IB such that the set {b \u2208 IB | b \u2264 a} is\na \u03b4-ideal in (A, \u03c1, IB) \u21d0\u21d2 J = {b \u2208 IB | b \u2264 a} for some a \u2208 IB.\nThe well-known Stone's result [18] that open sets correspond to the ideals is\ncontained in the next corollary.\n\n25\n\n\fCorollary 4.6 Let (A, I) be a ZLBA, X = \u0398a (A, I)(= \u0398ag (I)) and (O(X), \u2286) be\nthe frame of all open subsets of X. Then there exists a frame isomorphism\n\u03b9 : (Idl(I), \u2264) \u2212\u2192 (O(X), \u2286).\nThe isomorphism \u03b9 sends the set P I(A, I) of all A-principal ideals of (A, I) onto\nthe set of those regular open subsets of X whose complements are in \u03bbgA (A). In\nparticular, if A is a complete Boolean algebra, then \u03b9(P I(A, I)) = RO(X).\nProof. By Lemma 1.8, (A, \u03c1s , I) is an LCA. As it is noted in 4.1, in this situation\nthe notions of \"\u03b4-ideal of (A, \u03c1s , I)\" and \"ideal of I\" coincide. Using also the remark\nin 4.2 about A-principal ideals, we obtain that our assertion is a particular case of\nTheorem 4.4. Thus the isomorphism \u03b9 from Theorem 4.4 is the required one.\nCorollary 4.7 (M. Stone [18, Theorem 5]) Let (A, I) be a ZLBA, (X, O) = \u0398a (A, I)\n(= \u0398ag (I)), J be an ideal of I and U = \u03b9(J) (see Corollary 4.6 or Theorem 4.4 for\n\u03b9). Then:\n(a) U is a clopen set \u21d0\u21d2 J is a simple ideal of I \u21d0\u21d2 J is an A-principal ideal;\n(b) U is a regular open set iff J is a normal ideal of I;\n(c) U is a compact open set iff J is a principal ideal of I.\nProof. The proofs of the statements (b) and (c), as well as of the first part of (a),\nare analogous to the proofs of the corresponding assertions in Corollary 4.5. So, we\nneed only to prove the second assertion in (a). By Proposition 1.18, we have that\n\u03bbgA (A) = CO(X). Hence, according to Corollary 4.6, A-principal ideals correspond\nto those regular open sets whose complements are in \u03bbgA (A), i.e. in CO(X). Thus,\nJ is an A-principal ideal iff U is a clopen set. This assertion has also an easy direct\nproof.\nWe have seen that the open sets correspond to the \u03b4-ideals. Now we are going\nto describe explicitly the dual objects of the open subsets of a locally compact\nHausdorff space X using only the dual object of X and the corresponding \u03b4-ideal.\nRecall that if A is a Boolean algebra and a \u2208 A then the set \u2193 a endowed with\nthe same meets and joins as in A and with complements b\u2032 defined by the formula\nb\u2032 = b\u2217 \u2227 a, for every b \u2264 a, is a Boolean algebra; it is denoted by A|a. If J =\u2193 (a\u2217 )\nthen A|a is isomorphic to the factor algebra A/J; the isomorphism h : A|a \u2212\u2192 A/J\nis the following: h(b) = [b], for every b \u2264 a (see, e.g., [16]).\na\nTheorem 4.8 Let (A,\nW \u03c1, IB) be a CLCA, X = \u03a8 (A, \u03c1, IB) and I be a \u03b4-ideal of\n(A, \u03c1, IB). Set aI = I and B = A|aI . For every a, b \u2208 B, set a\u03b7b iff there exist\nc, d \u2208 I such that c\u03c1d, c \u2264 a and d \u2264 b. Then (B, \u03b7, I) is a CLCA. If \u03c6 : A \u2212\u2192 B is\nthe natural epimorphism (i.e. \u03c6(a) = a \u2227 aI , for every a \u2208 A) then \u03c6 is a DOpLCmorphism. Set U = \u039ba (B, \u03b7, I) and f = \u03a8a (\u03c6). Then f : U \u2212\u2192 X is an open\ninjection and f (U) = \u03b9(I) (see 4.4 for \u03b9). Hence, U is homeomorphic to \u03b9(I) and,\nthus, (B, \u03b7, I) is isomorphic to the dual object \u03a8t (\u03b9(I)) of the open set \u03b9(I).\n\n26\n\n\fProof. Obviously, B is a complete Boolean algebra and \u03c6 is a surjective complete\nBoolean homomorphism.\nS\nSet V = \u03b9(I) (i.e. V = {\u03bbgA (b) | b \u2208 I}). Then V is open in X (see 4.4) and\ncl(V ) = \u03bbgA (aI ). Since I is a \u03b4-ideal, {int(\u03bbgA (b)) | b \u2208 I} is an open cover of V .\nIf I = {0} then V = \u2205, aI = 0, B = {0} and U = \u2205; hence, in this case the\nassertion of the theorem is true. Thus, let us assume that I 6= {0}.\nWe will first check that (B, \u03b7, I) is a CLCA, i.e. that conditions (C1)-(C4)\nand (BC1)-(BC3) from [4] are fulfilled. Note that, for every a, b \u2208 B, a\u03b7b implies\nthat a\u03c1b; thus, if a \u226a\u03c1 b then a(\u2212\u03c1)b\u2217 and hence a(\u2212\u03c1)(b\u2217 \u2227 aI ), which implies that\na \u226a\u03b7 b.\nW\nLet b \u2208 B \\ {0}. Then b = {c \u2227 b | c \u2208 I}. Thus there exists c \u2208 I such that\nc \u2227 b 6= 0. We get that d = c \u2227 b \u2208 I, d \u2264 b and d\u03c1d. Therefore b\u03b7b. So, the axiom\n(C1) is fulfilled. Using the same notations, we get that there exists a \u2208 IB \\ {0} such\nthat a \u226a\u03c1 d. Then a \u2208 I \\ {0} and a \u226a\u03b7 b. Therefore, the axiom (BC3) is checked\nas well. Clearly, the axioms (C2), (C3) and (BC2) are satisfied. Let a, b1 , b2 \u2208 B\nand a\u03b7(b1 \u2228 b2 ). Then there exist c, d \u2208 I such that c \u2264 a, d \u2264 b1 \u2228 b2 and c\u03c1d.\nSince d = (d \u2227 b1 ) \u2228 (d \u2227 b2 ), we get that either c\u03c1(d \u2227 b1 ) or c\u03c1(d \u2227 b2 ). Clearly, this\nimplies that either a\u03b7b1 or a\u03b7b2 . The converse implication is obvious. So, we obtain\nthat the axiom (C4) is also fulfilled.\nLet a \u2208 I, b \u2208 B and a \u226a\u03b7 b. Then a(\u2212\u03b7)(b\u2217 \u2227 aI ). Thus, for every c \u2208 I\nsuch that c \u2264 b\u2217 , we have that a(\u2212\u03c1)c. Since a \u2208 I and I is a \u03b4-ideal, we get that\nthere exists c \u2208 I such that a \u226a\u03c1 c \u226a\u03c1 aI . Then c \u2227 b\u2217 \u2264 b\u2217 and c \u2227 b\u2217 \u2208 I. Thus\na(\u2212\u03c1)(c \u2227 b\u2217 ), i.e a \u226a\u03c1 (c\u2217 \u2228 b). Combining this fact with the inequality a \u226a\u03c1 c, we\nget that a \u226a\u03c1 (c \u2227 (c\u2217 \u2228 b)), i.e. a \u226a\u03c1 (b \u2227 c). Then there exists d \u2208 IB such that\na \u226a\u03c1 d \u226a\u03c1 (c \u2227 b). Since c \u2227 b \u2208 I, we get that d \u2208 I. Therefore, a \u226a\u03c1 d \u226a\u03c1 b. This\nimplies that a \u226a\u03b7 d \u226a\u03b7 b. Thus, the axiom (BC1) is checked.\nSo, we have proved that (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) is a CLCA.\nWe will show that \u03c6 is a DOpLC-morphism, i.e. that \u03c6 satisfies axioms (L1),\n(L2) and (LO) from [4]. Note first that, for every a \u2208 B,\n(3)\n\n\u03c6\u039b (a) = a.\n\nThis observation shows that \u03c6 satisfies conditions (L2) and (EL1) from [4] (note that\ncondition (EL1) is equivalent to the condition (L1)). Let us prove that the axiom\n(LO) is fulfilled as well. Let a \u2208 A, b \u2208 I and \u03c6\u039b (b)\u03c1a. Then a\u03c1b. We have to show\nthat b\u03b7\u03c6(a), i.e. that b\u03b7(a \u2227 aI ). Suppose that b(\u2212\u03b7)(a \u2227 aI ). Then, for every c \u2208 I\nsuch that c \u2264 a, we have that b(\u2212\u03c1)c. Since I is a \u03b4-ideal, there exists d \u2208 I such that\nb \u226a\u03c1 d \u226a\u03c1 aI . Then d \u2227 a \u2208 I and d \u2264 a. Hence b(\u2212\u03c1)(d \u2227 a), i.e. b \u226a\u03c1 (d\u2217 \u2228 a\u2217 ).\nSince b \u226a\u03c1 d, we get that b \u226a\u03c1 (d \u2227 (d\u2217 \u2228 a\u2217 )). Thus b \u226a\u03c1 a\u2217 , i.e. b(\u2212\u03c1)a, a\ncontradiction. Therefore, condition (LO) is checked. So, \u03c6 is a DOpLC-morphism.\nSince \u03c6 is a surjection, Theorem 3.23 implies that f : U \u2212\u2192 X is an open injection\nand hence f is a homeomorphism between U and f (U). Let us show that f (U) = V .\nRecall that the function f is defined by the formula f (\u03c3u ) = \u03c3\u03c6\u22121 (u)\nS(= \u03c3\u03c6\u039b (u) ), where\nu is a bounded ultrafilter in (B, \u03b7, I). We have also that V = {\u03bbgA (a) | a \u2208 I}.\n27\n\n\fNow, if \u03c3u \u2208 U then there exists a \u2208 I \u2229 u. Since \u03c6(a) = a \u2227 aI = a, we get that\na \u2208 \u03c6\u22121 (u). Thus f (\u03c3u ) \u2208 \u03bbgA (a) \u2286 V . Hence, f (U) \u2286 V . Conversely, if \u03c3 \u2032 \u2208 V then\nthere exists a \u2208 \u03c3 \u2032 \u2229 I. Thus, there exists an ultrafilter v in A such that a \u2208 v and\n\u03c3 \u2032 = \u03c3v . Obviously, v \u2229 I is a filter-base of v (because a \u2208 v \u2229 I and I is an ideal). It\nis clear that u = v \u2229 B is a bounded filter in (B, \u03b7, I). Moreover, u is an ultrafilter\nin B. Indeed, let c \u2208 B =\u2193A (aI ). If c \u2208 v then c \u2208 u. If c\u2217 \u2208 v then a \u2227 c\u2217 \u2208 v \u2229 B\nand thus c\u2217 \u2227 aI \u2208 u, i.e. c\u2032 \u2208 u. Hence, u is a bounded ultrafilter in (B, \u03b7, I).\nSince \u03c6\u039b (u) = u and u is a filter-base of v, we get that f (\u03c3u ) = \u03c3\u03c6\u039b (u) = \u03c3v = \u03c3 \u2032 .\nTherefore, f (U) = V .\nThe analogous question for the dualities between the categories ZLC and\nZLBA, and between PZLC and GBPL, is much easier. Since the category PZLC\nis a cofull subcategory of the category ZLC, it is enough to describe the dual GBPLobjects of the objects of the category ZLC, as it is done by M. Stone in [18]. If\nI is the dual object of some X \u2208 |ZLC| then (Si(I), eI (I)) is its dual object in\nZLBA. Since for every X \u2208 |ZLC| and every open subset U of X we have that\nCK(U) = {F \u2208 CK(X) | F \u2286 U} = IU = \u03b9\u22121 (U) and IU is an ideal of CK(X),\nwe get that IU is not only the ideal of CK(X) corresponding to U but it is also\nthe dual object of U in the category GBPL, i.e. IU = \u0398tg (U); thus the dual object\n\u0398t (U) of U in ZLBA is (Si(IU ), eIU (IU )). Conversely, if I is an ideal of CK(X)\nthen I = \u03b9\u22121 (\u03b9(I)) and hence I = \u0398ag (\u03b9(I)).\nWe will now show how one can build the CLCAs corresponding to the regular\nclosed subsets of a locally compact Hausdorff space Y from the CLCA \u03a8t (Y ).\nTheorem 4.9 Let (A, \u03c1, IB) be a CLCA, X = \u03a8a (A, \u03c1, IB), a0 \u2208 A and F = \u03bbgA (a0 ).\nSet B = A|a0 and let \u03c6 : A \u2212\u2192 B be the natural epimorphism (i.e. \u03c6(a) = a \u2227 a0 ,\nfor every a \u2208 A). Put IB\u2032 = \u03c6(IB) and let, for every a, b \u2208 B, a\u03b7b iff a\u03c1b. Then\n(B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) is a CLCA. If G = \u03a8a (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) then G is homeomorphic to F and thus\n\u03a8t (F ) is isomorphic to (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ). If f = \u03a8a (\u03c6) then f : G \u2212\u2192 X is a closed\nquasi-open injection and f (G) = F .\nProof. We have that B is a complete Boolean algebra, \u03c6 is a complete Boolean\nhomomorphism and \u03c6\u039b (a) = a, for every a \u2208 B. Set \u03c8 = \u03bbgA \u25e6 \u03c6\u039b . We will\nshow that \u03c8 \u2032 = \u03c8\u21beB is a Boolean isomorphism between B and RC(F ). Since F \u2208\nRC(X), we have, as it is well known, that RC(F ) \u2286 RC(X) and RC(F ) = {G \u2227\nF | G \u2208 RC(X)}; moreover, RC(F ) = RC(X)|F . Hence \u03c8 \u2032 : B \u2212\u2192 RC(F ) is a\nBoolean isomorphism. For any a, b \u2208 B, we have that a\u03b7b \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c6\u039b (a)\u03c1\u03c6\u039b (b) \u21d0\u21d2\n\u03bbgA (\u03c6\u039b (a)) \u2229 \u03bbgA (\u03c6\u039b (b)) 6= \u2205 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c8(a)\u03c1F \u03c8(b). Finally, for any a \u2208 B, we have\nthat a \u2208 IB\u2032 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c6\u039b (a) \u2208 IB \u21d0\u21d2 \u03bbgA (\u03c6\u039b (a)) is compact \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c8(a) \u2208 CR(F ).\nTherefore, (B, \u03b7, IB\u2032 ) is a CLCA because (RC(F ), \u03c1F , CR(F )) is such, and they\nare isomorphic. For showing that f : G \u2212\u2192 X is a homeomorphic embedding\nand f (G) = F , note that \u03c6 satisfies conditions (L1)-(L3) from [4] and condition\n(InSkeLC), and hence, by Theorem 3.22, f is a quasi-open perfect injection, i.e.\nf is a homeomorphic embedding. From [4, (45)] we get that, for every b \u2208 IB\u2032 ,\n28\n\n\fS\nf (\u03bbgB (b)) = \u03bbgA (\u03c6\u039b (b)) = \u03bbgA (b) \u2286 F . Since G = {\u03bbgB (b) | b \u2208 IB\u2032 }, we obtain that\nf (G) \u2286 F . Let y \u2208 intX (F ). Then there exists b \u2208 IB such that y \u2208 int(\u03bbgA (b)) \u2286\n\u03bbgA (b) \u2286 intX (F ). Hence b \u2208 IB\u2032 . Using again [4, (45)], we get that y \u2208 f (\u03bbgB (b)),\ni.e. y \u2208 f (G). Thus intX (F ) \u2286 f (G). Since f (G) is closed in X, we conclude that\nf (G) \u2287 F . Therefore, f (G) = F .\nNow, for every X \u2208 |ZLC|, we will describe the dual objects \u0398t (F ) and \u0398tg (F )\nof the closed or regular closed subsets of X by means of the dual objects \u0398t (X) and\n\u0398tg (X) of X. The obtained result for regular closed subsets of X seems to be new\neven in the compact case.\nTheorem 4.10 Let I, J \u2208 |GBPL|, X = \u0398ag (I) and F = \u0398ag (J). Then:\n(a)(M. Stone [18, Theorem 4(4)]) F is homeomorphic to a closed subset of X iff\nthere exists a 0-pseudolattice epimorphism \u03c6 : I \u2212\u2192 J (i.e. iff J is a quotient of I);\n(b) F is homeomorphic to a regular closed subset of X if and only if there exists a\n0-pseudolattice epimorphism \u03c6 : I \u2212\u2192 J which preserves all meets that happen to\nexist in I.\nProof. (a) Let F be homeomorphic to a closed subset of X, i.e there exists a closed\nembedding f : F \u2212\u2192 X. Then, by Theorem 3.29, \u03c6\u2032 = \u0398tg (f ) : \u0398tg (X) \u2212\u2192 \u0398tg (F )\nis a surjective 0-pseudolattice homomorphism. Thus, by the duality, there exists a\na surjective 0-pseudolattice homomorphism \u03c6 : I \u2212\u2192 J.\nConversely, if \u03c6 : I \u2212\u2192 J is a surjective 0-pseudolattice homomorphism then,\nby Theorem 3.29, F is homeomorphic to a closed subset of X.\n(b) Having in mind the assertion (a) above and Theorem 2.6, it is enough to show\nthat if f : F \u2212\u2192 X is a closed injection then f (F ) \u2208 RC(X) iff f is a quasi-open\nmap. This can be easily proved, so that the proof of assertion (b) is complete.\nWe will finish with mentioning some assertions about isolated points. All these\nstatements have easy proofs which will be omitted.\nProposition 4.11 (a) Let (A, \u03c1, IB) be an LCA, X = \u03a8a (A, \u03c1, IB) and a \u2208 A.\nThen a is an atom of A iff \u03bbgA (a) is an isolated point of the space X. Also, for\nevery isolated point x of X there exists an a \u2208 IB such that a is an atom of IB\n(equivalently, of A) and {x} = \u03bbgA (a).\n(b) Let (A, I) be a ZLBA, X = \u0398a (A, I) and a \u2208 A. Then a is an atom of A iff\n\u03bbgA (a) is an isolated point of the space X. Also, for every isolated point x of X there\nexists an a \u2208 I such that a is an atom of I (equivalently, of A) and {x} = \u03bbgA (a).\nProposition 4.12 (a) Let (A, \u03c1, IB) be an LCA and X = \u03a8a (A, \u03c1, IB). Then X is\na discrete space iff IB coincides with the set of all finite sums of the atoms of A.\n(b) Let (A, I) be a ZLBA and X = \u0398a (A, I)(= \u0398ag (I)). Then X is a discrete space\n\u21d0\u21d2 I coincides with the set of all finite sums of the atoms of A \u21d0\u21d2 the elements\nof I are either atoms of I or finite sums of atoms of I.\n29\n\n\fProposition 4.13 (a) Let (A, \u03c1, IB) be a CLCA and X = \u03a8a (A, \u03c1, IB). Then X is\nan extremally disconnected space iff a \u226a\u03c1 a, for every a \u2208 A.\n(b)(M. Stone [18]) Let (A, I) be a ZLBA and X = \u0398a (A, I)(= \u0398ag (I)). Then X is\nan extremally disconnected space iff A is a complete Boolean algebra.\nProposition 4.14 (a) Let (A, \u03c1, IB) be an LCA and X = \u03a8a (A, \u03c1, IB). Then the\nset of all isolated points of X is dense in X iff A is an atomic Boolean algebra iff\nIB is an atomic 0-pseudolattice.\n(b) Let (A, I) be a ZLBA and X = \u0398a (A, I)(= \u0398ag (I)). Then the set of all isolated\npoints of X is dense in X iff A is an atomic Boolean algebra iff I is an atomic\n0-pseudolattice.\n\nReferences\n[1] W. Comfort, S.
