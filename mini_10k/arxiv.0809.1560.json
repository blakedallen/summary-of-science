Introduction\nThe first explicit construction of expander graphs was introduced by\nMargulis [Marg1] and was an application of Kazhdan's property (T).\nExpanders are simultaneously sparse and highly connected and are not\nonly of theoretical importance but also useful in computer science, e.g.,\nfor network designs. An extensive survey of this topic is given in [HLW].\nCartwright and Steger [CS] constructed infinite sequences of groups\nacting simply transitively on the vertices of buildings of type \u00c3n . Using these groups, Lubotzky, Samuels and Vishne [LSV] and, independently, Sarveniazi [Sar] presented explicit constructions of expanders\nand proved that they are, in fact, (higher dimensional) Ramanujan\ncomplexes.\nM. Ershov constructed in [Er] for every sufficiently large prime p a\ngroup violating the Golod-Shafarevich inequality (as presented in [LS,\np. 87]) and having property (T). Since those groups have infinitely\n1\n\n\f2\n\nN. PEYERIMHOFF AND A. VDOVINA\n\nmany p-quotients, this fact provided new families of expanders in connection with pro-p groups.\nIn this article, we bring many of these aspects together. In Section 3,\nwe present two new families of Cayley graph expanders of vertex degree\n4. One family is given by a tower of coverings with covering indices\nequals 2, and the other family is given by very short presentations with\n2 generators and only 4 relations:\nTheorem 1.1. The groups\nGk := h x0 , x1 | r1, r2 , r3 , [x1 ,\n\nk\n\nx0 ] i,\n\nwith\n\u22123\nr1 = x1 x0 x1 x0 x1 x0 x\u22123\n1 x0 ,\n\u22121 \u22123 2 \u22121\nr2 = x1 x\u22121\n0 x1 x0 x1 x0 x1 x0 x1 ,\n2 2\nr3 = x31 x\u22121\n0 x1 x0 x1 x0 x1 x0 x1 x0 ,\n\nare finite and the associated Cayley graphs with respect to the symmetric\n\u00b11\nset {x\u00b11\n0 , x1 } define an infinite family of expanders of vertex degree 4,\nsatisfying |Gi | \u2192 \u221e.\nEach expander graph has twice as many edges as it has vertices.\nTo prove that our graphs are expanders indeed, we present them as\nCayley graphs of finite quotients of a group G acting cocompactly on\nan Euclidean building of type \u00c32 , like in [LSV] or [Sar], but our graphs\nare not Ramanujan for sufficiently many vertices.\nThe group G is given by hx0 , x1 | r1 , r2 , r3 i. The pro-2 completion\nb\nG2 of G can be considered as a finitely presented pro-2 group. In\nSection 4, we discuss particular properties of this pro-2 group. Even\nb2 satisfies the Golod-Shafarevich inequality, it is still infithough G\nnite. Lubotzky [Lub1] has shown that p-adic analytic groups satisfy\nb2 , however, is not p-adic\nthe Golod-Shafarevich inequality. The group G\nanalytic. Wilson [Wi] conjectured that discrete, resp., pro-p groups violating the Golod-Shafarevich inequality have free subgroups, resp.,\nfree pro-p subgroups of rank two. The first conjecture was later proved\nin [WZ] and the proof of the second conjecture can be found in [Zel,\nb 2 satisfies this inequality, doesn't contain a free\np. 224]. The group G\npro-2 subgroup, but it nevertheless contains a free subgroup of rank\ntwo.\nOur considerations are based on a linear representation of the group\nG by infinite upper unitriangular matrices over the field F2 . It is particularly useful to view these infinite matrices as been built up by diagonals of 3 \u00d7 3 block matrices. Natural normal subgroups Hi are\n\n\fCAYLEY GRAPH EXPANDERS AND GROUPS OF FINITE WIDTH\n\n3\n\ngiven by infinite upper triangular matrices with vanishing first i upper\ndiagonals. Let\nG = \u03bb0 (G) \u2265 \u03bb1 (G) \u2265 * * *\ndenote the lower exponent-2 series of G. Obviously, we have \u03bbi (G) \u2264\nG\u2229Hi . In Theorem 2.2 of Section 2, we prove a particular 3-periodicity\nfor the abelian quotients \u03bbi (G)/(\u03bbi (G) \u2229 Hi+1 ) and derive explicit bases\nfor them. These considerations give useful information about the structure of our families of Cayley graph expanders.\nComputer calculations show for the group G the identities \u03bbi (G) =\nG \u2229 Hi from i \u2265 1 onwards and \u03bbi (G)/\u03bbi+1 (G) \u223c\n= \u03b3i (G)/\u03b3i+1 (G) from\ni \u2265 2 onwards, up to the index i = 100. Here, \u03b3i (G) denote the\nlower central series groups of G. If these identities are true for all iindices, then our group G has finite width 3 and finite average width\n8/3, and the covering indices of our expander graphs Gi are given by\nthe 3-periodic sequence 4, 8, 4, 8, 8.\nThe group G is a subgroup of a group \u0393 belonging to a class of groups\n\u0393T , which were constructed in [CMSZ, Section] and are related to\nparticular triangle presentations T of special finite projective planes of\nprime power order q. We expect that analogous finite width properties\nhold also for these groups \u0393T (see Conjecture 2 in Section 4). Again,\nthis conjecture has been checked by computer for many i-indices for\nthe prime powers q = 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11.\nAcknowledgement: The authors are grateful to M. Belolipetsky,\nA.

The group \u0393 in (2) is generated by x0 , x1 , x2 and the\nsubgroup G generated by x0 , x1 is an index two normal subgroup of \u0393.\nEven though [\u0393 : G] = 2 follows from covering arguments, we give a\ndifferent proof for this fact as well.\nProof: The relations imply that x3 = (x0 x1 )\u22121 , x4 = (x1 x2 )\u22121 , x5 =\n\u22121\nx0 x1 x\u22121\n2 , x6 = (x0 x2 ) , so \u0393 is generated by x0 , x1 , x2 .

Explicit construction of expanders\nThe simplicial complex K, introduced at the beginning of Section 2,\nconsists of 2 vertices and 14 triangular faces. The link of each vertex\nis isomorphic to an incidence graph of a finite projective plane of order\n2 (see [V] for more details of constructing polyhedra and determining\ntheir links). Using [BS] (see also [Pa] or [Z]) we conclude that the\nfundamental group G of K has property (T). We also like to mention\nthat the Kazdhan constants of the groups \u0393T of Desarguesian projective\nplanes were exactly calculated in [CMS].)\n\u00b11\nWe choose the symmetric generating set S := {x\u00b11\n0 , x1 } of the group\nG. As explained, e.g., in [Lub2, Prop. 3.3.1], Kazdhan property (T) of\nG implies that the Cayley graphs of all quotients of finite index normal\nsubgroups of G (with respect to the set S) have a uniform positive lower\nbound on their combinatorial Cheeger constants. Thus, any sequence\nof normal subgroups with finite indices converging to infinity yields a\nfamily of expanders. We choose the normal subgroups Ni = G \u2229 Hi .\nNote that [H : Hi ] is a power of two, since the quotient H/Hi can be\nidentified with the vector space S i over F2 via the map\n(9)\n\nM(a1 , a2 , . . . )Hi 7\u2192 (a1 , a2 , . . . , ai ) \u2208 S i .\n\nThis implies that the groups Ni have finite indices in G which are,\nagain, powers of 2. We know from Corollary 2.4 that these indices converge to infinity, so the corresponding Cayley graphs Gi are expanders.\nLet us now have a closer look at the explicit matrix models of the\nquotients G/Ni , obtained via the identification (9). This identification\ninduces a nonabelian group structure on the space S i . In fact, the\nidentity element is 0i \u2208 S i and we have\n(a1 , a2 , . . . , ai ) * (b1 , b2 , . . . , bi ) = (c1 , c2 , . . . , ci ),\n(a1 , a2 , . . . , ai )\u22121 = (d1 , d2 , . . . , di )\nwith\n(10)\n\ncj (k) = aj (k) + bj (k) +\n\nj\u22121\nX\n\nas (k)bj\u2212s (k + s),\n\ns=1\n\nwhere k, k + s are taken mod 3.

Ki is generated by the\n\n\fCAYLEY GRAPH EXPANDERS AND GROUPS OF FINITE WIDTH\n\n11\n\nimages of x0 Ni and x1 Ni , which we denote by v0 and v1 . Hence, we\nhave v0 = (a1 , . . . , a5 , 0, . . . ) \u2208 S i and v1 = (b1 , . . . , b5 , 0, . . . ) \u2208 S i with\na1 , . . . , b5 defined in (4) and (5). (If i < 5, we set v0 = (a1 , . . . , ai ) and\nv1 = (b1 , . . . , bi ).) The expanders Gi are the Cayley graphs of Ki with\nrespect to {v0\u00b11 , v1\u00b11}.

The graphs G0 and G1\nLet us briefly explain how to construct G2 , a regular graph with\n25 = 32 vertices. Let v0 = (a1 , a2 ) and v1 = (b1 , b2 ) be the images\nof x0 and x1 in the group K2 \u2282 S 2 and w1 = (0, \u03b12 ), w2 = (0, \u03b22 )\nand w3 = (0, \u03b32). Note that S 2 has both a vector space structure and\na nonabelian multiplicative group structure (given by (10) and (11)).\nThe elements of K2 are given by\nM\nK2 :=\nv + F2 w 1 + F2 w 2 + F2 w 3 \u2282 S 2 ,\nv\u2208{02 ,v0 ,v1 ,v0 *v1 }\n\nand the center of K2 is generated by w1 , w2 , w3 . Thus we have v * wi =\nwi * v = v + wi for all v \u2208 K2 . Using v02 = w2 , v12 = w3 , [v1 , v0 ] = w1\n(which we compute with (10) and (11) or we conclude it from (8)), we\nobtain\n(13)\n\nv1 * v0 = v0 * v1 + w1 ,\n\nv0\u22121 = v0 + w2 ,\n\nand v1\u22121 = v1 + w3 .\n\nThe vertices of G2 are the elements of K2 and the neighbours of a vertex\nv \u2208 G2 are the vertices v * v0\u00b11 and v * v1\u00b11 . These neighbours can all\nbe calculated with the help of (13). The graph G2 is illustrated in\nFigure 4 (where we use the abbreviations wij and wijk for wi + wj and\nwi + wj + wk ).\nComputer calculations with MAGMA show that the graph G5 with\n13\n2 = 8192 vertices is the first graph which is not Ramanujan.

Ge1 \u2192 Ge0 ,\n\nwhere the covering indices of two subsequent graphs are exactly 2. This\nfollows easily from the fact that every finite 2-group has a normal index\n2 subgroup. The graphs Gei are still expanders with the same positive\nlower bound on their combinatorial Cheeger constants. This \"completed\" tower of 2-fold coverings fits well to results of Bilu and Linial\n[BL]. They present a construction of 2-fold towers of covering graphs\nwith nearly optimal spectral gap. They also conjecture, based on extensive numerical tests, that every Ramanujan graph has a 2-fold covering\nwhich is again Ramanujan. If their conjecture is true, there should\nbe a different continuation of the sequence G4 \u2192 G3 \u2192 * * * \u2192 G0 by\nRamanujan graphs.\n\n\fCAYLEY GRAPH EXPANDERS AND GROUPS OF FINITE WIDTH\n\n13\n\nThe group G can also be used to obtain another family of Cayley\ngraph expanders of minimal vertex degree 4, presented in Theorem 1.1,\ngiven by finite groups with two generators and only four relations.\nProof of Theorem 1.1: We conclude from Proposition 2.6 that\n[x1 , k x0 ] = Mk (\u03b1k+1 , . . . ) (taking k in the index of \u03b1k=1 mod 3),\nand hence this commutator never represents the identity in G. By\nthe normal subgroup theorem (see, e.g., [Marg1]), we know that the\ngroup G is just infinite. Consequently, all the groups Gk are finite.\nThe corresponding Cayley graphs are expanders because G has Kazdhan property (T). Since [x1 , k x0 ] \u2208 G \u2229 Hk = Nk , we conclude from\nCorollary 2.4 that\n|G3i+j | \u2265 [G : N3i+j ] \u2265 28i\u22121+\u03bc(j) .\n\u2737\nRemark 3.1. Expanders are increasing families of finite graphs with a\nuniform positive lower bound on their combinatorial Cheeger constants\n(or edge expansion ratios). The combinatorial Cheeger constants for\ninfinite regular tessellations Gp,q of the hyperbolic plane (i.e., every vertex is of degree p and every face is a q-gon) was exactly calculated in\n[HJL] and [HiShi]. Lower bounds for more general planar tessellations\n(in terms of combinatorial curvature) were derived in [KP]. It would be\ninteresting to derive similar results for Euclidean and hyperbolic buildings and more general non-planar simplicial complexes. Note, however,\nthat there is no simple relation between the Cheeger constants of infinite\ngraphs and their finite quotients.\n4. Further properties of the group G and its pro-2\ncompletion\nb2 of our group\nLet us now have a closer look at the pro-2 completion G\nG. Since Ni = G \u2229 Hi are finite index normal subgroups of G with [G :\nNi ] equals powers of 2 and \u2229i Ni = {e}, G can be considered as a dense\nb2 . Moreover, by [Lub1, Lemma 2.1], G\nb2 has a minimal\nsubgroup of G\npro-2 presentation given by hx0 , x1 |r1 , r2 , r3 i, with the relations r1 , r2 , r3\nb2\ndefined in (1). Consequently, every minimal presentation hX|Ri of G\nsatisfies the Golod-Shafarevich inequality\n|X|2\n|R| \u2265\n= 1,\n4\nb2 is not free. (Golod-Shafarevich theorem implies that every\nsince G\npresentation of a finite p-group with minimal number of generators\n\n\f14\n\nN. PEYERIMHOFF AND A.

Next we show that G\nWe conclude from (6) that\nb 2k \u2282 G\nb2 \u2229 H2k \u22121 .\nG\n2\n\nCorollary 2.4 implies that [G : Nn ] \u2265 22n . Consequently, we have\nb2 : G\nb 2 ] \u2265 [G : N2k \u22121 ] \u2265 2(2 ) .\n[G\n2\nk\n\nk\n\nb2 cannot be of finite rank and therefore not\nBy [DdSMS, Thm 3.16], G\n2-adic analytic.\nThe presentation of \u0393 given (2) satisfies the conditions C(3) and\nT (6). (In fact, \u0393 is isomorphic to the group G3 = hx|r3 i in [EH, Ex.\n3.3].) Thus we conclude with [EH] that \u0393 (and, therefore, also G and\nb2 ) contains a free subgroup of rank two. On the other hand, G\nb2\nG\ncannot contain a free pro-2 subgroup since it is a linear group over a\nlocal field (see [BaL]).\n\u0003\nFinally, let us state our conjectures which are based on MAGMAcomputer calculations.\nConjecture 1. Let \u03bbi (G) and \u03b3i (G) denote the groups in the lower\nexponent-2 series and the lower central series of G. Then we have\n\u03bbi (G) = G \u2229 Hi for i \u2265 1,\nand\n\n\u03bbi (G)/\u03bbi+1 (G) \u223c\n= \u03b3i (G)/\u03b3i+1 (G) for i \u2265 2.\n\nIf Conjecture 1 is true then Theorem 2.2 is still valid if we replace\n\u03bbi (G) and \u03bbi (G) \u2229 Hi+1 by \u03b3i (G) and \u03b3i+1 (G), respectively, and, consequently, the group \u0393 is of finite width 3 and of finite average width\n(3 + 3 + 2)/3 = 8/3. Moreover, the covering indices of our tower of\nexpander graphs Gi are given by the periodic sequence 4, 8, 4, 8, 8.\nComputer calculations suggest that not only the group \u0393 is of finite\nwidth 3, but also all groups \u0393T introduced in [CMSZ, Section 4] and\nassociated to prime powers q = pk with primes p 6= 3 (we exclude p = 3\n\n\fCAYLEY GRAPH EXPANDERS AND GROUPS OF FINITE WIDTH\n\n15\n\nto avoid torsion phenomena). Here we expect the following statements\nto be true:\nConjecture 2. Let \u0393 = \u0393T be one of the groups introduced in [CMSZ,\nSection 4], associated to a prime power q = p3 with p 6= 3. Then we\nhave the following 3-periodicity for the ranks of the abelian quotients\n\u03b3i (\u0393)/\u03b3i+1 (\u0393) of the lower central series for i \u2265 2:\n(\n3, if i \u2261 0, 1 mod 3,\nlogp [\u03b3i (\u0393) : \u03b3i+1 (\u0393)] =\n2, if i \u2261 2 mod 3.\n5. Appendix\nThis section is devoted to the proof of Proposition 2.5. For any 3 \u00d7 3\nmatrix \u03b1 \u2208 M(3, F2 ) and m, n \u2208 Z, we denote by Em,n (\u03b1) the infinite\nmatrix, built up by 3 \u00d7 3 matrices, which vanishes everywhere expect\nfor its 3\u00d73 entry at position (m, n), which coincides with \u03b1. (m denotes\nthe 3 \u00d7 \u221e row and n denotes the \u221e \u00d7 3 column.) Moreover, given an\ninfinite matrix A, built up by 3 \u00d7 3 matrices, let \u03c0m,n (A) denote its\n3 \u00d7 3 entry at position (m, n). Obviously, we have \u03c0m,n (Em,n (\u03b1)) = \u03b1.\nFor simplicity we sometimes denote \u03c0m,n (A) also by Am,n .\nLemma 5.1. Let m, n \u2265 1, \u03b1 \u2208 M(3, F2 ) and b \u2208 S.

Moreover,\nwe have at all positions (m\u2032 , n\u2032 ) with m\u2032 > m or n\u2032 < n\n\u03c0m\u2032 ,n\u2032 (M0 (b, . . . )\u22121 Em,n (\u03b1)M0 (b, . . . )) = 0.\nProof: A straightforward calculation shows M0 (b, . . . )\u22121 = M0 (\u2212b, . . . ).\nThen we have\nX\nAm\u2032 ,i Bi,j Cj,n\u2032 ,\n\u03c0m\u2032 ,n\u2032 (ABC) =\ni,j\n\nand in particular\n\n\u03c0m\u2032 ,n\u2032 (AEm,n (\u03b1)C) = Am\u2032 ,m \u03b1Cn,n\u2032 .\nThe lemma follows now immediately from\n\u03c0m\u22121,m (M0 (b, . . . )\u22121 ) = \u2212b(m \u2212 1),\nand \u03c0i,j (M0 (b, . . . )\u00b11 ) = 0 for j < i.\n\n\u03c0n,n+1 (M0 (b, . . . )) = b(n + 1),\n\u0003\n\n\f16\n\nN.
