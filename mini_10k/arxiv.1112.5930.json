This is possible because the interaction of the BD scalar field with the metric slows the\nexpansion from exponential to power-law. The BD theory contains only one dimensionless parameter, \u03c9 and\nthe effective gravitational constant is inversely proportional to the scalar field \u03c6. BD theory has been proved to\nbe very effective regarding the recent study of cosmic acceleration [3]. This theory yields the correct Newtonian\nweak-field limit, but solar system measurements of post-Newtonian corrections require \u03c9 > 500 [4]. In the limit\n\u03c9 \u2192 \u221e, the field \u03c6 becomes a constant [5] and we recover Einstein gravity. This theory has very effectively\nsolved the problems of inflation and the early and the late time behaviour of the Universe. N. Banerjee and\nD. Pavon [3] have shown that BD scalar tensor theory can potentially solve the quintessence problem. The\ngeneralized BD theory [6] is an extension of the original BD theory with a time dependent coupling function\n\u03c9. In Generalized BD theory, the BD parameter \u03c9 is a function of the scalar field \u03c6. This has led to more\ngeneral scalar-tensor gravity [7] being considered with a self-interacting potential [8, 9]. Modified BD theory\nwith a self-interacting potential have also been introduced in this regard. Bertolami and Martins [10] have used\nthis theory to present an accelerated Universe for spatially flat model. They have obtained the solution for\naccelerated expansion with a potential \u03c62 and large |\u03c9|, although they have not considered the positive energy\nconditions for the matter and scalar field.\nDynamical system theory [11] has been applied with great success in cosmology and astrophysics within the\ncontext of general relativity. This theory are used to describe the behaviour of complex dynamical systems\nusually by constructing differential equations. This theory deals with a long term qualitative behaviour of\nthe formed differential equations. It does not concentrate to find the precise solutions of the system but\nprovide answers like- whether the system is stable for long time and whether the stability depend on the\ninitial conditions. Besides the other scientific fields this theory is now become widely useful in the research of\ncosmology. Its range of applicability has been enlarged by considering alternate theories of gravity, such as\nthose which do not obey the principle of minimal coupling [12], Kaluza-Klein [13] and scalar-tensor theories\n[14]. There are several works on qualitative analysis in dynamical system of FRW cosmology in BD gravity [9,\n15]. There are some literature where the authors have studied dynamical evolution of some models where the\nuniverse is filled with dark energy on an interaction has occurred between dark matter or barotropic matter\nand some dark energies like Generalized Chaplygin Gas [16], New Generalized Chaplygin Gas[17], ELKO non\nstandard spinor dark energy [18], DBI essence [19], non- minimally coupled scalar field [20], k-essence [21] etc.\nThere are some other approach of dynamical system analysis to diffrent model the universe on the frame work\nof loop quantum gravity and non linear electro dynamics [22, 23]. Some authors [9, 24] have shown that the\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\nbhadra.jhumpa@gmail.com\nshuvendu.chakraborty@gmail.com\nujjaldebnath@yahoo.com , ujjal@iucaa.ernet.in\n\n\f2\nfield equations for FRW cosmological models could be reduced to a two dimensional dynamical system for any\nreasonable perfect fluid matter source in BD theory and in the presence of scalar potential, the cosmological\ndynamical system turns out to be generally three dimensional, apart from radiation dominated universes in\nwhich the system once more reduces to two dimensions.\nHere we have considered an anisotropic model [25, 26] containing perfect fluid and BD scalar field with\nself-interacting potential. The starting point of our work is to reduce the field equations to a three dimensional\nautonomous dynamical system. From the knowledge of mathematical features of the system, we have found\nthe critical points and the exact solutions for the system of equations. Some of the solutions are valid for fluids\nsatisfying the equation of state and for particular values of \u03b3. The stability around the critical points have\nbeen investigated.\n\nII.\n\nBASIC EQUATIONS\n\nThe self-interacting Brans-Dicke (BD) theory is described by the action: (choosing 8\u03c0G0 = c = 1)\n\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u221a\n\u03c9\nd4 x \u2212g \u03c6R \u2212 \u03c6,\u03b1 \u03c6,\u03b1 \u2212 V (\u03c6) + Lm\n\u03c6\n\n(1)\n\nwhere V (\u03c6) is the self-interacting potential for the BD scalar field \u03c6 and \u03c9 is the BD parameter.

We present three dimensional dynamical system describing the evolution of anisotropic flat (k = 0) model containing perfect fluid with\nbarotropic EoS and BD scalar field with self-interacting potential. Choosing the power law form of the potential\nfunction V in terms of \u03c6, and defining the three variables X, Y and Z, the field equations can be transformed\ninto the dynamical system. The critical points and the corresponding eigen values have been found in radiation,\ndust, dark energy, \u039bCDM and phantom phases of the universe. The natures and the stability around the\ncritical points have also been investigated. For dark energy case, we have considered \u03b3 = 31 , \u03c9 = 0.5, V0 = 0.5,\nand one critical point is (0.679563, 1.01934, 0.428571), which is a stable attractor. Another critical point is\n(\u22120.679563, \u22121.01934, 0.428571), which is unstable around that fixed point. The 3D phase space diagram of\nparameters X, Y, Z have been drawn in figure 1 corresponding to the stable critical point. From figure 2, we see\nthat X and Y initially increase and then decrease and Z increases in late stage of the universe. For phantom\ncase, we have taken \u03b3 = \u2212 21 , \u03c9 = \u22120.5, V0 = 4, and one critical point is (2.8606, 2.24761, 1.497), which is\na stable attractor. Another critical point is (\u22122.8606, \u22122.24761, 1.497), which is unstable around that fixed\npoint. The 3D phase space diagram of parameters X, Y, Z have been drawn in figure 3 corresponding to the\nstable critical point. From figure 4, we see that X and Y initially increase and then decrease and Z increases in\nlate stage of the universe. For radiation case, we have considered \u03b3 = 43 , \u03c9 = \u22121.45, V0 = 0.5, and the only\ncritical point becomes (0.1, 0, 0.912871) which is unstable.

The initial conditions\n2\n\n2\n\nchosen are X(0) = \u22121.2, Y (0) = \u22120.2, Z(0) = 1.2V03 (green); X(0) = \u22121.1, Y (0) = \u22120.3, Z(0) = 1.3V03 (blue);\n2\n\n2\n\nX(0) = \u22121.0, Y (0) = \u22120.4, Z(0) = 1.4V03 (red); X(0) = \u22120.9, Y (0) = \u22120.5, Z(0) = 1.5V03 (brown).\nFIG. 10: The progression of X(\u03b7), Y (\u03b7), Z(\u03b7) for \u03b3 = 1, \u03c9 = \u22120.7, V0 = 2 and initial condition is X(0) = 0.4, Y (0) = 0.6,\n2\n\nZ(0) = V03 .\n\nhave been drawn in figure 5 corresponding to the critical point. From figure 6, we see that Y and Z increase\nand X decreases. For \u039bCDM case, we have taken, \u03b3 = 0, \u03c9 = \u22120.1, V0 = 0.2, and the critical points become\n(\u00b10.463304, \u00b10.463304, 20.2) and these are unstable. The 3D phase space diagram of parameters X, Y, Z have\nbeen drawn in figure 7 corresponding to the critical point. From figure 8, we see that X and Y initially\nincrease and then decrease and Z increases in late stage of the universe. For dust case, we have assumed\n\u03b3 = 1, \u03c9 = \u22120.6, V0 = 0.2, and the possible critical points are (\u00b11.28263, \u00b10.641315, 0.733281) which are\nunstable. The 3D phase space diagram of parameters X, Y, Z have been drawn in figure 9 corresponding to the\ncritical point. From figure 10, we see that Y and Z increase and X decreases. So the anisotropic model of the\nuniverse in Brans-Dicke theory can be stable for some cases of the fluid distribution in late stage of the evolution.\nAcknowledgement:\nOne of the authors (JB) is thankful to CSIR, Govt of India for providing Junior Research Fellowship.\nReferences:\n[1] C.
