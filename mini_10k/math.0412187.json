The main idea of the theory of complexity for 3-manifolds (introduced in [16, 17], investigated in [8], and comprehensively covered in [18]) is\nSupported by the INTAS YS fellowship 03-55-1423 and by the Russian Ministry of\nEducation\n\u2217\u2217\nSupported by the INTAS project \"CalcoMet-GT\" 03-51-3663\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\fto introduce a filtration in the set of all 3-manifolds, in such a way that each\nlevel of the filtration contains only finitely many closed irreducible items.\nThis allows to break down the task of classifying all closed 3-manifolds into\nan infinite collection of finite classification tasks, because complexity is also\nadditive under connected sum, so the complexity of any closed manifold can\nbe computed once the complexity of its irreducible summands is known. This\nclassification program has been carried out to a remarkable extent in recent\nyears (see [14] and the references quoted therein).\nFor any given manifold it is very easy to give upper bounds for its complexity, whereas lower bounds are much harder to establish. As a matter of\nfact, the computer programs of Martelli and Matveev [14], which manipulate\nspecial spines, provide upper bounds which experimentally are always sharp.\nOn the other hand, the only methods currently known to obtain general lower\nbounds are those of [19], based on group theory (for some hyperbolic manifolds, there is also a lower estimate in terms of the volume by Anisov, see\n[1]). From this point of view the results of the present paper can be viewed\nas potential tools for constructing more lower estimates on the complexity of\nmanifolds. This idea is specified in Lemma 1.7 below, and a concrete application is given in Theorem 4.5, where we provide two-sided bounds for the\ncomplexity of certain infinite classes of Seifert manifolds. These estimates\nare \"asymptotically exact up to linear maps,\" meaning that the upper and\nthe lower bound differ by a fixed linear function.\nThe notion of T -invariant, also closely related to the complexity of 3manifolds (see [5, 6, 7] or the proof of Theorem 4.7 below), was introduced by\nDelzant in [5] for what appear to be completely different reasons, namely, to\nstudy hierarchical decompositions of finitely presented groups. For instance,\nit played a central r\u00f4le in the proof by Delzant himself and Potyagailo of the\nstrong accessibility theorem for such groups [7]. For one-relator groups, the\nT -invariant was studied in [12].\nThe complexity and the T -invariant of a group never coincide, except for\nthe trivial group, but they are closely related and they can be studied by\nsimilar methods. Exploiting this fact, we provide in this paper lower bounds\nfor the complexity and the T -invariant of an arbitrary finitely presented group\nin terms of the order of the torsion part of its Abelianization (Theorems 2.2\nand 2.7). Then, for all the members of Milnor's list [20] of finite groups with\nfree linear action on S 3 , as well as for all finite Abelian groups, we present\ntwo-sided estimates on their complexity (Theorems 3.6 and 3.10) and on the\nvalue of the T -invariant (Theorems 3.9 and 3.10, and Remark 3.12).\n2\n\n\fFor some Milnor groups, the estimates we obtain show that the complexity\nis asymptotically given by the logarithm of the order of the torsion part of the\nAbelianization, up to linear maps. Using results from this paper and from\nprevious ones we also provide similar \"asymptotically exact\" estimates for\nthe complexity of certain Seifert manifolds (Theorem 4.5). We then in turn\napply this theorem to derive more precise bounds on the complexity and the\nT -invariant of some of the other Milnor groups (Theorems 3.14 and 4.7). The\ninterplay between the estimates on complexity and those on the T -invariant\nis that by combining upper and lower bounds we can deduce information on\nthe average length of the relations in a presentation realizing the complexity\n(Propositions 3.7, 3.13, and 4.8). It is interesting to note that for some Milnor\ngroups the complexity is asymptotically very close to that of the 3-manifolds\nwhose fundamental groups they are (Theorems 4.5 and 4.7).\nAcknowledgments The authors are grateful to Sergei Matveev for his\nmany useful remarks regarding this work.

Let ha1 , . . . , an | r1 , . . . , rm i be a presentation of a group.\nThe length of this presentation is the number |r1 | + . . . + |rm |, where |ri | is\n\u00b11\nthe length of the word ri in the alphabet a\u00b11\n1 , . . . , an . The complexity c(G)\nof a group G admitting finite presentations is the minimum of the lengths of\nall such presentations.\n\n3\n\n\fIt can be seen (by explicit enumeration of presentations of small length)\nthat for n 6 7 the complexity of the cyclic group of order n is equal to n.\nHowever, the groups Z/8 and Z/9 both have complexity 7, which is smaller\nthan the order, and c(Z/10 ) = 8. The following presentation of Z/147 , which\nhas length 23, shows that the complexity can be significantly smaller than\nthe order:\nha, b, c, d| a4 bc4 , b3 c\u22121 , a2 d3 b\u22121 , a3 d\u22121 i.\nAn alternative measure of how complicated a group is, now called the\nT -invariant of the group, was suggested by Delzant in [5] and investigated in\n[6, 7]:\nDefinition 1.2. The T -invariant T (G) of a finitely presented group G is\nthe minimal number t such that G admits a presentation with t relations\nof length 3 and an arbitrary number of relations of length at most 2. A\npresentation of this type is called triangular.\nThe following easy fact was already noted in [5]:\nProposition 1.3.\n( m\n)\nX\nT (G) = min\nmax{|ri | \u2212 2, 0} : G = ha1 , . . . , an | r1 , . . . , rm i .\ni=1\n\n3-manifolds We now review some notions related to 3-manifolds. We will\nuse the PL category throughout.\nDefinition 1.4. A 2-dimensional subpolyhedron P of a closed connected\n3-manifold M is called a spine of M if M \\ P is homeomorphic to an open\n3-ball.\nIn particular, for every spine P of M we have \u03c01 (P ) \u223c\n= \u03c01 (M). We will\nconsider only a particular class of spines, that we now define.\nDefinition 1.5. A compact polyhedron is called special if the following two\nconditions hold. First, the link of each point is homeomorphic to one of the\nfollowing 1-dimensional polyhedra:\n(a) a circle;\n4\n\n\f(b) a circle with a diameter;\n(c) a circle with three radii.\nSecond, the components of set of points of type (a) are open discs, while the\ncomponents of set of points of type (b) are open segments. The components\njust described are called faces and edges, respectively, and the points of type\n(c) are called vertices. A special spine of a closed manifold M is a spine of\nM which is a special polyhedron at the same time.\nThe notion of complexity for (arbitrary) 3-manifolds was introduced in [16],\nsee also [17]. We will only need here the following partial characterization,\nwhich could also be used as a definition:\nProposition 1.6. The complexity c(M) of a closed irreducible manifold M \u2208\n/\n3\n3\n{S , RP , L3,1 } is the minimal number of vertices of a special spine of M. The\ncomplexity of the three exceptional manifolds is equal to zero.\nIt turns out that there is a clear relation between the complexity of a\n3-manifold and the complexity of its fundamental group. This relation is\ndescribed in the following lemma, which was essentially proved in [19].\nLemma 1.7. If a manifold M has a special spine P with n vertices then\n\u03c01 (M) has a presentation of length 3n + 3.\nProof. We know that \u03c01 (M) coincides with \u03c01 (P ). Moreover, the stratification of P into vertices, edges, and faces gives P the structure of a cell\ncomplex. So we can employ the general algorithm yielding a presentation of\nthe fundamental group of a cell complex. The generators are the edges in\nthe complement of a maximal tree in the 1-skeleton, so there are n + 1 of\nthem. The relations correspond to the faces. Since precisely 3 faces are incident to any given edge (with multiplicity), the total length of the relations\nis 3(n + 1).\nAccording to this result, an upper bound on c(M) implies an upper bound\non c(\u03c01 (M)), and a lower bound on c(\u03c01 (M)) implies a lower bound on c(M).\n\n5\n\n\f2\n\nLower estimates\n\nIn this section we establish lower estimates for the complexity and the T invariant for an arbitrary group, whereas starting from the next section we\nwill concentrate on Abelian and Milnor groups.\nGroup complexity We begin with an easy lower bound on the complexity\nof a group G in terms of the so-called relation matrices of the presentations of\nG. Recall that, given a presentation of G with n generators and m relations,\nthe relation matrix associated to the presentation has size m \u00d7 n, and its\nentry in position (i, j) is the (algebraic) sum of all the exponents of the j-th\ngenerator in the i-th relation. If X = (xi,j ) is the matrix thus obtained we\ndefine its norm as\nn\nm X\nX\n|xi,j |.\n||X|| =\ni=1 j=1\n\nWe have the following:\n\nLemma 2.1. For every finitely presented group G we have\nc(G) > min ||X||,\nwhere the minimum is taken over the relation matrices X associated to all\npossible finite presentations of G.\nProof. We only need to note that ||X|| is less than or equal to the length of\nthe presentation to which X is associated.\nTo provide more effective lower bounds on c(G) we then need to give an\nestimate on the possible norms of the relation matrices of G. This is done in\nthe next result, where Tor(H) denotes the torsion (i.e. finite-order) part of\nan Abelian group H.\nTheorem 2.2. For any finitely presented group G we have\nc(G) > log2 | Tor(G/[G, G])|.\nProof. By Lemma 2.1 it is enough to show that ||X|| > log2 | Tor(G/[G, G])|\nfor all the relation matrices X of the presentations of G. Fix such an X and\n6\n\n\fsuppose its size is m \u00d7 n. It is well-known that X can be transformed into a\nmatrix of the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nD 0\nY =\n,\n0 0\nwith D a k \u00d7 k diagonal matrix, and det(D) 6= 0 if k > 1, using a finite\nsequence of operations as follows:\n1. Interchange two rows or columns;\n2. Multiply one row or column by \u22121;\n3. Add one row or column to a different one.\nOne can now see that each such operation transforms the relation matrix of\na finite presentation of G into the relation matrix of some other presentation\nof G, which easily implies that | Tor(G/[G, G])| = |det(D)|.\nIf we set d = |det(D)| we have the obvious property that the determinants\nof all the k \u00d7 k submatrices of Y are multiples of d, and some of them is nonzero. Moreover one can easily see that this property is preserved under all\nthe inverse operations which lead from Y back to X. Therefore there is a\nk \u00d7 k submatrix X \u2032 of X such that det(X \u2032 ) is a non-zero multiple of d, so in\nparticular |det(X \u2032 )| > d.\nWe can now observe that |det(X \u2032 )| is bounded from above by the product\nof the Euclidean norms of the rows of X \u2032 , and each such norm is bounded\nfrom above by the L1 -norm, whence by the L1 -norm of the corresponding\nwhole row of X. Noting that each non-zero row of X has norm at least 1,\nand dismissing the zero rows if necessary (recall that we want to give a lower\nbound on kXk), we conclude that |det(X \u2032 )| is bounded from above by the\nproduct of the L1 -norms of all the non-zero rows of X. Therefore\n| Tor(G/[G, G])| = d 6\n\u21d2 log2 | Tor(G/[G, G])| 6\n\n7\n\nm X\nn\nY\ni=1 j=1\n\nm\nX\ni=1\n\n|xi,j |\n\nlog2\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\n!\n\n|xi,j | .\n\n\fNoting that log2 n 6 n for all n \u2208 N we deduce that\nlog2 | Tor(G/[G, G])| 6\n\nm X\nn\nX\ni=1 j=1\n\n|xi,j | = kXk,\n\nand the proof is complete.\nRemark 2.3. In the previous statement the base a = 2 of logarithms was\nchosen because it has the property that loga (n) 6 n for all n \u2208 N, and the\ntheorem remains true with any other base a having this property. One easily\n\u221a\nsees that the best lower estimate for c(G) is obtained for a = 3 3. Since\nwe are only interested in the qualitative fact that a logarithmic lower bound\nexists, we will keep employing the base 2. However we will use the fact that\nthe inequality in the previous statement is strict.\nRemark 2.4. Along the proof of Theorem 2.2 we have shown that for any\npresentation ha1 , . . . , an | r1 , . . . , rm i of a group G the following inequality is\nvalid:\nlog2 | Tor(G/[G, G])| 6 log2 |r1 | + . . . + log2 |rm |.\nThe T -invariant Proposition 1.3 allows to conclude immediately that\nT (G) < c(G) for a non-trivial G. However, we will show that in many\ncases the invariants c and T are asymptotically equivalent. We begin with\ntwo rather easy results.\nLemma 2.5. Let G be a finitely presented group. Then for every finite\npresentation of G there is a presentation of the same or smaller length which\ncontains relations of length > 2 only, and all relations of length 2 are of the\nform x2 . Moreover, G admits a triangular presentation with exactly T (G)\nrelations of length 3 and some relations of the form x2 .\nProof. Of course the relations of length 0 can always be omitted. Suppose\nthe given presentation is ha1 , . . . , an | r1 , . . . , rt , r1\u2032 , . . . , rk\u2032 i, where the lengths\nof all ri are > 3, and the lengths of all rj\u2032 are 1 or 2. We describe a recursive\nprocedure to get a presentation as desired. If some rj\u2032 has length 1, i.e. it\nis of the form x, then this x can be removed from the generators and from\nall the relations where it occurs. This produces a presentation of G with the\n8\n\n\fsame or a smaller number of relations of length > 3, and the total length\nof the presentation, as well as each relation's own length, is not increased.\nHence there is a presentation of G of the same or smaller length with 6 t\nrelations of length > 3 and some number of relations of length 2.\nConsider a relation of length 2. If it has the form x\u22121 y, then we can discard it and the generator y, replacing all occurrences of y in all the relations\nby x. Such a procedure increases neither the lengths of the other relations\nnor the total length of the presentation. So in the end we get a presentation\nof G of the described type and of the same or smaller length.\nIf the initial presentation is triangular, so is the final one, and the last\nassertion follows.\nProposition 2.6. Let G be a nontrivial finitely presented group without 2torsion. Then\n1\nc(G) 6 T (G) < c(G).\n3\nProof. The second inequality is valid in general and was already remarked\nabove. For the first inequality, consider a triangular presentation of G of\nthe type described in Lemma 2.5. Suppose there is a relation of the form\nx2 . Then, since G does not have elements of order 2, x has to be trivial\nin G. Hence we can remove all occurrences of x from all the relations and\nremove x itself from the list of generators. As a result we get a triangular\npresentation of G which contains exactly T (G) relations of length 3 (a priori\nno more than that number, but by minimality there cannot be less) and no\nrelations of length less than 3.\nCombining the previous result with Theorem 2.2 we deduce that if G has\nno 2-torsion then\n1\nT (G) > log2 | Tor(G/[G, G])|.\n3\nThis estimate can actually be improved to a stronger and general one:\nTheorem 2.7. Let G be a finitely presented group, and let | Tor(G/[G, G])| =\n2l (2m + 1). Then\nT (G) > log3 (2m + 1).\n\n9\n\n\fProof. Consider a triangular presentation of the type described in Lemma 2.5,\nwith t = T (G) relations of length 3 and some h relations of the form x2 . The\nrelation matrix X of this presentation has the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\nY Z\n,\nX=\n2Ih 0\nwhere the matrix (Y Z) has t rows, the L1 -norm of each row is 3, and Ih is the\nh \u00d7 h unit matrix. As in the proof of Theorem 2.2, X has a square submatrix\nX \u2032 whose determinant is non-zero and divisible by | Tor(G/[G, G])| = 2l (2m+\n1). On the other hand, X \u2032 consists of t\u2032 6 t rows of L1 -norm 3 and some\nh\u2032 6 h rows with a single non-zero entry equal to 2. It follows that |det(X \u2032 )| =\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2h * \u03b4 and \u03b4 6 3t 6 3t . Recalling that |det(X \u2032 )| is divisible by 2l (2m + 1),\nwe deduce that \u03b4 is divisible by 2m + 1, whence 2m + 1 6 \u03b4 6 3t , and the\ndesired estimate follows.\n\n3\n\nAbelian and Milnor groups\n\nIn this section we will give two-sided estimates for the complexity and the\nT -invariant of all the Milnor groups, and in the process we will obtain similar\nestimates for Abelian groups.\nMilnor groups As already mentioned, Milnor classified in [20] the finite\ngroups having a free linear action on S 3 . The complete list of all such groups\nis as follows:\n1. Q4n = hx, y| x\u22121 yxy, x\u22122 y n i, n > 2;\nk\n\n2. D2k (2n+1) = hx, y| x2 , y 2n+1 , xyx\u22121 y i, k > 3, n > 1;\n3.\nP24 = hx, y| x\u22121 yxyxy, x\u22122 y 3 , x4 i,\nP48 = hx, y| x\u22121 yxyxy, x\u22122 y 4 , x4 i,\nP120 = hx, y| x\u22121 yxyxy, x\u22122 y 5, x4 i,\nk\n\u2032\n\u22121\nP8*3\nyxy, x\u22122 y 2, zxz \u22121 y \u22121, zyz \u22121 y \u22121x\u22121 , z 3 i, k > 2;\nk = hx, y, z| x\n\n10\n\n\f4. The direct product of any of the groups listed so far, or of the trivial\ngroup, with a cyclic group of coprime order.\nWe will start by considering the simplest case, namely, cyclic groups. It\nis interesting to note that many of the ideas which will be used for the other\ngroups in the list are already present at this level.\nCyclic groups In this paragraph we give two-sided estimates for the complexity and the T -invariant of finite cyclic groups and we describe some\nproperties of their minimal presentations. Although arbitrary finite Abelian\ngroups are not in Milnor's list, the complexity estimates can be generalized\nto include them with no extra effort, so we cover them too. We begin with\nan upper estimate:\nProposition 3.1. For every p > 2 we have c(Z/p ) < 4 log2 p.\nTo prove this result, we first state the following evident:\nLemma 3.2. Let p, q, r, s be non-negative integers such that p = sq + r.\nConsider a group presentation of length l involving a relation of the form\nuap v, where a is a generator and u, v are words in the generators. Then a\nnew presentation of the same group is obtained by adding a new generator\nb and a new relation b\u22121 aq , and replacing the relation uap v by ubs ar v. The\nlength of the new presentation is 1 + l + q + r + s \u2212 p.\nLet us denote now by l(p) the shortest length of a presentation of the\ngroup Z/p obtained from the trivial presentation ha| ap i by repeated application of the lemma just stated. Of course c(Z/p ) 6 l(p), so the next result\nimplies Proposition 3.1:\nProposition 3.3. For all p > 2 we have l(p) < 4 log2 p.\nProof. We proceed by induction on p, noting that the inequality is true for\np = 2 and p = 3, because l(2) = 2 and l(3) = 3. For the inductive step, for\np > 4 we apply Lemma 3.2 with q = 2, and we distinguish according to the\nparity of p. If p is even then\nZ/p = ha, b| b\u22121 a2 , bp/2 i\n\u21d2\n\nl(p) 6 3 + l(p/2) < 3 + 4 log2 (p/2) = 4 log2 p \u2212 1 < 4 log2 (p).\n11\n\n\fIf p is odd then\nZ/p = ha, b| b\u22121 a2 , b(p\u22121)/2 ai\n\u21d2\n\nl(p) 6 4 + l((p \u2212 1)/2)\n\n< 4 + 4 log2 ((p \u2212 1)/2) = 4 log2 (p \u2212 1) < 4 log2 (p).\n\nThis proves the desired inequality.\nExample 3.4. Applying the procedure described in the previous proof for\np = 357 we get the following length-27 presentation of Z/357 :\nha, b, c, d, e, f, g, h| b\u22121 a2 , c\u22121 b2 , d\u22121 c2 , e\u22121 d2 , f \u22121 e2 , g \u22121f 2 , h\u22121 g 2 , h2 gf cai.\nRemark 3.5. The estimate in Proposition 3.3, whence that in Proposition 3.1, can actually be improved using q = 3 rather than q = 2 for the\nrepeated application of Lemma 3.2. Namely, one can show that c(Z/p ) <\n6 log3 p, which is a slightly better bound since log6 3 \u2248 3.786 < 4. All other\n2\nchoices of q, on the other hand, produce bounds with larger constants.\nIn the case of an arbitrary finite Abelian group G, Proposition 3.1 implies\nthe following result. Recall that the rank of G is the minimal number of cyclic\ngroups which G can be expressed as the direct product of.\nTheorem 3.6. Let G be a finite Abelian group of rank k. Then c(G) <\n4 log2 |G| + 2k(k \u2212 1).\nProof. By assumption, G is isomorphic to Z/p1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Z/pk , and |G| = p1 *\n. . . * pk . We can obtain a presentation of G by taking the union of the\npresentations of Z/pi constructed in Proposition 3.3 and adding relations\nproviding the commutativity. Notice that the generating set constructed\nin Proposition 3.3 always contains an element generating the whole group.\nHence it suffices to add k(k\u22121)/2 relations of length 4 each (the commutators\nof all pairs of different generators). This produces a presentation of length\nthat is strictly less than\nk(k \u2212 1)\n2\n= 4 log2 (p1 * . . . * pk ) + 2k(k \u2212 1) = 4 log2 |G| + 2k(k \u2212 1)\n4 log2 p1 + . . . + 4 log2 pk + 4\n\nand the theorem is proved.\n12\n\n\fAverage length In view of Proposition 1.3, in order to estimate the T invariant for a cyclic group, one would need a lower bound on the number\nof relations in a length-minimizing presentation (i.e. a presentation realizing\nthe complexity). Such a bound is established in the following:\nProposition 3.7. Suppose that ha1 , . . . , an | r1 , . . . , rm i is a length-minimizing\npresentation of a finite cyclic group. Then\n|r1 | + . . . + |rm |\n< 16.\nm\nProof. If p is the order of G, according to Proposition 3.1 we have log2 p >\n(|r1 | + . . . + |rm |)/4. Moreover p = | Tor(G/[G, G])|, so by Remark 2.4 we\nhave log2 p 6 log2 |r1 | + . . . + log2 |rm |. Combining these two estimates we\nget the inequality\n\u0001\n|r1 | + . . . + |rm | < 4 * log2 |r1 | + . . . + log2 |rm | ,\n\nwhich we divide by m to obtain\n\n|r1 | + . . . + |rm |\nlog |r1 | + . . . + log2 |rm |\n<4 2\n.\nm\nm\np\nThe right-hand side of the latter inequality is just 4 log2 m |r1 | * . . . * |rm |.\nApplying the Cauchy inequality between the geometric mean and the arithmetic one to the expression under the sign of logarithm, we get\n\u0012\n\u0013\n|r1 | + . . . + |rm |\n|r1 | + . . . + |rm |\n.\n< 4 log2\nm\nm\nIt follows that the number (|r1 | + . . . + |rm |)/m must satisfy the inequality\nx < 4 log2 x. Now, the numbers satisfying this inequality lie between the\ntwo solutions to the equation x = 4 log2 x and therefore are bounded from\nabove by the greatest of them, which evidently is x = 16, because the other\nsolution lies between 1 and 2. The desired estimate on (|r1 | + . . . + |rm |)/m\nfollows.\nRemark 3.8. Using the better estimate given by Remark 3.5 one could show\nthat (|r1 | + . . . + |rm |)/m < 15.\n13\n\n\fThe values of the T -invariant for cyclic groups can now be estimated as\nfollows.\nTheorem 3.9. For every odd p and for every integer k > 0 we have that\n\u0001\n1\n7\nlog2 p 6 T Z/2k p < (log2 p + k).\nlog2 3\n2\n\nProof. The lower estimate follows from Theorem 2.7. For the upper estimate,\ntake a length-minimizing presentation of Z/2k p with relations r1 , . . . , rm . Since\n|ri | > 2, Proposition 1.3 implies that\nT (Z/2k p ) 6 |r1 | + . . . + |rm | \u2212 2m.\nProposition 3.7 now yields\n7\n|r1 | + . . . + |rm | \u2212 2m 6 (|r1 | + . . . + |rm |),\n8\n\u0001\nand |r1 | + . . . + |rm | = c Z/2k p by the choice of the presentation, but\n\u0001\nc Z/2k p < 4(log2 p + k) by Proposition 3.1, whence the conclusion.\n\nOther Milnor groups A straight-forward application of the technique\nused to prove Proposition 3.3 and of Theorem 2.2 allows us to obtain some\nestimates on the complexity of all the other groups in Milnor's list:\nTheorem 3.10. The following estimates hold for the complexity of the Milnor groups, where in all cases the lower bound equals the base-2 logarithm of\nthe order of the torsion of the Abelianization, and the same term appears in\nthe upper estimate too:\n1. For every n > 2 and every odd q coprime with n we have\nlog2 q + 2 < c(Q4n \u00d7 Z/q ) < 4(log2 q + 2) + 4 log2 n + 6;\n2. For every k > 3 and every coprime odds n > 3, q > 1, we have\nlog2 q + k < c(D2k n \u00d7 Z/q ) < 4(log2 q + k) + 4 log2 n + 12;\n14\n\n\f3. For every q coprime with 2 and 3 (and 5, for the last estimate) we have\nlog2 (3q) < c(P24 \u00d7 Z/q ) < 4(log2 (3q)) + 17;\nlog2 q + 1 < c(P48 \u00d7 Z/q ) < 4(log2 q + 1) + 20;\nlog2 q < c(P120 \u00d7 Z/q ) < 4 log2 q + 25;\n4. For every k > 2 and every q coprime with 2 and 3 we have\n\u2032\nlog2 q + (log2 3)k < c(P8*3\nk \u00d7 Z/q ) < 4(log2 q + (log2 3)k) + 29.\n\nProof. The lower bounds are obtained by direct application of Theorem 2.2\nand Remark 2.3. To get the upper bounds, we start by writing the most\nstraight-forward presentation for each of the groups listed in the theorem.\nNamely, we add to each of the standard presentations reproduced at the\nbeginning of the present section, one generator a (corresponding to Z/q ), a\nrelation aq , and the commutation relations [x, a] and [y, a] (and [z, a] for the\n\u2032\ngroup P8*3\nk ).\nNow we apply exactly the trick described in Lemma 3.2. Evidently, in\ncase of Q4n this produces a presentation of length l(n) + l(q) + 14. From\nthe estimate given by Proposition 3.3, we deduce that this number is less\nthan 4 log2 (nq) + 14, and the conclusion easily follows. In case of D2k n the\ntrick produces a presentation of length l(2k ) + l(n) + l(q) + 12, which implies\nthe bound stated in the theorem. For each of P24 , P48 , P120 we can get\na presentation of that group multiplied by Z/q having length l(q) plus the\nlength of the presentation of that group given above plus 8, and the upper\n\u2032\nbounds follow after easy calculations. Finally, for P8*3\nk we get a presentation\nk\nof length l(3 ) + l(q) + 29, which gives the desired bound again.\nRemark 3.11. Slightly better numerical estimates could be shown using\nRemarks 2.3 and 3.5.\nRemark 3.12. The above result together with Theorem 2.7 and the inequality T (G) < c(G) allows to obtain upper and lower bounds on the T -invariant\nof all Milnor groups. Since the upper bounds thus obtained coincide with\nthose for complexity, and the lower bounds are just an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.7, we do not spell them out here (see also below).\n15\n\n\fThe complexity estimates given in Theorem 3.10(3,4) are \"asymptotically\nexact up to linear functions,\" and we can now exploit this fact to give a similar\nestimate also for the T -invariant. We begin with the following:\n\u2032\nProposition 3.13. Let P be one of the groups P24 , P48 , P120 , P8*3\nk , and let\nq be a positive integer coprime with |P |. Suppose that ha1 , . . . , an | r1 , . . . , rm i\nis a length-minimizing presentation of P \u00d7 Z/q . Then\n\n|r1 | + . . . + |rm |\n< 52.\nm\nProof. Let G denote P \u00d7 Z/q . Combining the lower estimate given by Remark 2.4 with the upper estimate given by Theorem 3.10(3,4), we deduce\nthat\n\u0001\n|r1 | + . . . + |rm | < 4 log2 |r1 | * . . . * |rm | + 29.\nDividing by m, noting that 29/m 6 29, and using the Cauchy inequality as\nin the proof of Proposition 3.7, we deduce that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n|r1 | + . . . + |rm |\n|r1 | + . . . + |rm |\n+ 29,\n< 4 log2\nm\nm\n\nwhich means that the number (|r1 |+. . .+|rm |)/m must satisfy the inequality\nx < 4 log2 x + 29. Any such x lies between the two solutions of the equation\nx = 4 log2 x + 29. Notice that the smaller of the two solutions lies between\n1\nand 217 , and that 52 does not satisfy the inequality x < 4 log2 x + 29. It\n28\nfollows that all solutions to this inequality are less than 52.\nOnce again, we could slightly improve the numerical estimate given by this\nproposition, but we are actually only interested in the fact that a fixed upper\nbound exists. As announced, we use the proposition to give asymptotically\nexact estimates for T -invariant.\nTheorem 3.14. Let P be one of the groups P24 , P48 , P120 . Let q be a positive\ninteger coprime with 2 and 3 (and 5, for P = P120 ). Then\n50\n1\nlog2 q 6 T (P \u00d7 Z/q ) <\nlog2 q + 24,\nlog2 3\n13\n50\n1\n\u2032\nlog2 q + k 6 T (P8*3\n(log2 q + log2 3 * k) + 29.\nk \u00d7 Z/q ) <\nlog2 3\n13\n16\n\n\fProof. Let G be one of the groups mentioned in the statement. Since q is\nodd, the lower bounds follow from Theorem 2.7. To get the upper bounds,\nwe again apply Proposition 1.3 to a length-minimizing presentation of G,\ngetting\nT (G) 6 c(G) \u2212 2m,\nwhere m is the number of relations of a length-minimizing presentation of G.\nNow Proposition 3.13 implies that m > c(G)\n, so we finally get\n52\n25\nc(G).\n26\nCombining this inequality with the upper bounds from Theorem 3.10, we get\nour statement.\nT (G) <\n\n4\n\nMore asymptotically exact estimates\n(\u2032 )\n\nFor the Milnor groups of type P\u2217 \u00d7Z/q , Theorem 3.10(3,4) provides estimates\nwhich are \"asymptotically exact up to linear functions\" as q (and k) tend to\ninfinity, because the upper and lower estimates only differ by a fixed linear\nfunction. This is not the case for the other Milnor groups, i.e. those of\nTheorem 3.10(1,2), but it turns out that there are infinite families of such\ngroups for which similar asymptotic estimates actually do hold. This section\nis devoted to these estimates and to some related ones, having the same\nproperty of \"asymptotic exactness,\" for the T -invariant of the same groups\nand for the complexity of certain Seifert 3-manifolds. As a matter of fact, the\nestimates for groups depend on those for 3-manifolds, which employ results\nestablished elsewhere by more geometric methods.\nZaremba pairs To describe the families of Milnor groups we will deal\nwith we must make a digression into number theory. Specifically, we need\nthe following definition and some facts related to it.\nDefinition 4.1. A pair of coprime positive integer numbers (p, q) with p > q,\nis called a Zaremba pair if all the partial quotients ai in the expansion of p/q\ninto the continuous fraction\n1\np\n= a1 +\nq\na2 + ...+1 1\nan\n\n17\n\n\fsatisfy the inequality ai 6 5.\nFor example, all pairs of consecutive Fibonacci numbers are Zaremba\npairs.\nFor all coprime p > q > 1 we denote now by S(p, q) the sum of all the\npartial quotients in the expression of p/q as a continued fraction.\nProposition 4.2. If (p, q) is a Zaremba pair then S(p, q) 6 3 log2 p.\nProof. For any coprime p\u2032 > q \u2032 > 1, if a1 , . . . , an are the partial quotients\nin the expression of p\u2032 /q \u2032 as a continued fraction, one can easily show by\ninduction that\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012 \u2032 \u0013 \u0012\nan\nan\u22121 1\na2 1\np\na1 1\n.\n***\n=\n1\n1\n0\n1 0\nq\u2032\n1 0\nFor a Zaremba pair (p, q) only five matrices can appear in this formula\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n5 1\n4 1\n3 1\n2 1\n1 1\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0\n1 0\n\u0012\n\u0013\nan\nand there are only four possible \"starting points\"\n, namely\n1\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n5\n4\n3\n2\n.\n,\n,\n,\n1\n1\n1\n1\nThe proof now proceeds by induction on the length n of the expansion.\nFor n = 1 the conclusion follows from the fact that that m 6 3 log2 m for\n2 6 m 6 5.\nFor the inductive step we note that if 2 6 m 6 5 and we are given (p\u2032 , q \u2032 )\nsuch that S(p\u2032 , q \u2032 ) 6 3 log2 p\u2032 , setting\n\u0013\u0012 \u2032 \u0013\n\u0012 \u2032\u2032 \u0013 \u0012\np\np\nm 1\n,\n=\n\u2032\u2032\n1 0\nq\u2032\nq\nwe have\nS(p\u2032\u2032 , q \u2032\u2032 ) = m + S(p\u2032 , q \u2032 ) 6 3 log2 m + 3 log2 p\u2032\n= 3 log2 (mp\u2032 ) 6 3 log2 (mp\u2032 + q \u2032 ) = 3 log2 p\u2032\u2032 .\n18\n\n\fThis does not quite suffice to conclude when the expansion involves some\nmatrix with 1 in position (1,1). However one notes that the inequality m 6\n3 log2 m actually holds also for m = 6. Therefore, if one of m\u2032 , m\u2032\u2032 is 1 and\nthe other one is between 1 and 5, given (p\u2032 , q \u2032 ) such that S(p\u2032 , q \u2032 ) 6 3 log2 p\u2032 ,\nif we set\n\u0013\u0012 \u2032 \u0013\n\u0013 \u0012 \u2032\u2032\n\u0012 \u2032\u2032 \u0013 \u0012 \u2032\np\nm 1\np\nm 1\n=\n\u2032\u2032\nq\u2032\n1 0\nq\n1 0\nwe have\nS(p\u2032\u2032 , q \u2032\u2032 ) = m\u2032 + m\u2032\u2032 + S(p\u2032 , q \u2032) 6 3 log2 (m\u2032 + m\u2032\u2032 ) + 3 log2 p\u2032\n= 3 log2 ((m\u2032 + m\u2032\u2032 )p\u2032 ) 6 3 log2 ((m\u2032 + m\u2032\u2032 )p\u2032 + m\u2032 q \u2032 ) = 3 log2 p\u2032\u2032 .\nThis argument suffices to prove the inequality for all Zaremba pairs except\nthose of type (a + 1, a), for which the conclusion is obvious.\nThe conditions of Definition 4.1 may appear to be rather restrictive. However, the following fact is conjectured by numerical analysts: there exists a\nconstant B with the property that for every p there exists 1 < q < p coprime\nwith p such that all partial quotients in the expansion of p/q as a continued\nfraction are not greater than B. (This statement is known as Zaremba's conjecture, see [23]. Its motivation is to find optimal lattice points for numerical\nintegration, see also [13]). Cusick conjectured in [4] that B = 5. So far\nZaremba's conjecture has been proved only in a few particular cases. Niederreiter proved it for powers of 2 and 3 [21], and Yodphotong and Laohakosol\nproved it for powers of 6 [22]. On the other hand, it is known that there are\nactually \"many\" Zaremba pairs [9, 10]. We will also use the following weaker\ndefinition.\nDefinition 4.3. A pair of coprime positive integers (p, q) with p > q is called\na weak Zaremba pair if the partial quotients a1 , . . . , an in the expansion of\np/q into continuous fraction satisfy the inequality a1 + . . . + an 6 5n.\nWeak Zaremba pairs were investigated in [3, 11, 2], where it was shown\nthat they are also not infrequent.\nProposition 4.4. If (p, q) is a weak Zaremba pair then S(p, q) 6 10 log2 p.\nProof. An easy induction argument shows that n > 2 log2 p, whence the\nconclusion at once.\n19\n\n\fAsymptotically exact estimates for manifolds In this paragraph we\nconsider the complexity of certain Seifert manifolds and of their fundamental groups, which in some cases allows to obtain better bounds than those\nprovided by Theorem 3.10. We employ for Seifert manifolds the same notation as in [15]. Namely, if F is a closed surface, t is an integer, and\n(p1 , q1 ), . . . , (pk , qk ) are coprime pairs of integers with |pi | > 2, then\n\u0001\nF ; (p1 , q1 ), . . . , (pk , qk ), t\n\n \u0303 1,\ndenotes the (oriented) Seifert manifold obtained from F \u00d7 S 1 or from F \u00d7S\nif F is nonorientable, by removing k + 1 solid fibred tori and performing Dehn filling on the resulting boundary components with slopes p1 a1 +\nq1 b1 , . . . , pk ak + qk bk , ak+1 + tbk+1 . Here the ai 's are contained in a section of\nthe bundle, the bi 's are fibres, and each ai , bi is a positive basis in homology.\nTheorem 4.5. Let (p, q) be a Zaremba pair. Then\n2\nlog2 p \u2212 1 6 c(Lp,q ) 6 3 log2 p \u2212 3,\nlog2 5\n2\nlog2 q 6 c(S 2 ; (2, 1), (2, 1), (p, q), \u22121) < 3 log2 q + 9.\nlog2 5\nProof. The proof of the upper bound in the first formula is by direct application of [15, Theorem 1.11] and Proposition 4.2 above, because, with the\nnotation of [15], we have S(p, q) = |p, q| + 1. For the manifold M of the\nsecond formula, [15, Theorem 1.11] and [15, Theorem 2.5] yield the bound\nc(M) 6 S(p, q) + 1.\nSince (p, q) is a Zaremba pair, Proposition 4.2 implies that S(p, q) 6 3 log2 p.\nHowever, as for any Zaremba pair, p/q < a1 + 1 6 6. Hence\nc(M) < 3 log2 q + 3 log2 6 + 1 = 3 log2 q + log2 27 + 4.\nSince c(M) is an integer, we conclude that it actually does not exceed\n3 log2 q + ([log2 27] + 1) + 4 = 3 log2 q + 9, as desired.\nThe lower bounds in both formulae follow directly from [19, Theorem 1],\nbecause the order of the first homology group is p for Lp,q , and it is 4q for\nthe manifold in the second formula. This proves the theorem.\n20\n\n\fRemark 4.6. If (p, q) is a weak Zaremba pair and M is the lens space with\nparameters (p, q) then the complexity of M still depends on the order of\nthe first homology group of M logarithmically, as in point 1 of the previous\ntheorem, except that the constants are worse. Namely, we have\n2\nlog2 p \u2212 1 6 c(M) 6 10 log2 p \u2212 3.\nlog2 5\nExact asymptotic estimates for groups Theorem 4.5 serves as a tool\nto obtain good estimates on the complexity and the T -invariant for some of\nthe Milnor groups in Theorem 3.10(1,2).\n1. Let (n, q) be a Zaremba pair with odd q. Then\n\nTheorem 4.7.\n\nlog2 q + 2 < c(Q4n \u00d7 Z/q ) < 8(log2 q + 2) + 9,\n1\nlog2 q 6 T (Q4n \u00d7 Z/q ) < 6 log2 q + 18.\nlog 3\n2\n\n2. Let n, h, s be integers, with h, n > 3 and n, s coprime, and s odd. Let\nq = 2h\u22122s and suppose that (n, q) is a Zaremba pair. Then:\nlog2 s + h < c(D2h n \u00d7 Z/s ) < 8(log2 s + h) + 15,\n1\nlog2 s 6 T (D2h n \u00d7 Z/s ) < 6(log2 s + h) + 6.\nlog 3\n2\n\nIn both the estimates on the complexity of the group, the lower bound\nequals the base-2 logarithm of the order of the torsion of the Abelianization,\nand the same term appears in the upper bound too.\nProof. To begin, we notice that if (n, q) is a Zaremba pair then n < 6q.\nCombining this inequality with the estimates obtained in Theorem 3.10, we\nget the upper bounds on complexity. The lower bounds on the complexity\nand the T -invariant come from Theorems 2.2 and 2.7 respectively.\nTo get the upper estimates on the T -invariant, we first prove the following assertion, first remarked by Delzant himself: If M is a closed 3-manifold\nthen T (\u03c01 (M)) does not exceed twice the number of 3-simplices in any triangulation of M. To see this, we note that a triangulation gives in particular\na cell decomposition of M, so we can employ the general algorithm yielding\na presentation of the fundamental group. The relations then correspond to\n21\n\n\ffaces, and each face is a triangle, therefore the length of any relation is no\nmore than 3. Since M is a closed 3-manifold, the number of faces is twice\nthe number of 3-simplices, and the conclusion follows.\nThe fact just stated also holds for \"singular triangulations,\" i.e. triangulations with multiple and self-adjacencies. Therefore it follows from [18, Theorem 2.2.4] that if M is irreducible and c(M) > 0 then T (\u03c01 (M)) 6 2c(M).\nNow we note that the groups in the statement occur as fundamental groups\nof Seifert manifolds of type (S 2 ; (2, 1), (2, 1), (n, q), \u22121) (see, for instance, [18,\nChapter 2]). In particular, for odd q this manifold has fundamental group\nQ4n \u00d7 Z/q , and for even q it has fundamental group D2h n \u00d7 Z/s with h, s as\nin the statement. The conclusion then easily follows from Theorem 4.5.\nUsing Theorem 4.7, an argument similar to that used in the proofs of\nPropositions 3.7 and 3.13 can now be employed to establish the following:\nProposition 4.8. Let G be one of the groups of Theorem 4.7, and let\nha1 , . . . , an | r1 , . . . , rm i be a length-minimizing presentation of G. Then\n|r1 | + . . . + |rm |\n< 64.\nm\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
