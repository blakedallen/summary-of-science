The conjecture concerns\ntwo very different classes of compactifications of a locally symmetric variety X, and\nthe corresponding notions of canonical extension of homogeneous vector bundles E\non X. One class, the good toroidal compactifications X tor [AMRT], comes from X\nas an algebraic variety, with X tor a smooth complex projective variety. The other,\nthe Borel-Serre compactification X [BS] (a manifold-with-corners) and its reductive\nquotient X\n\nred\n\n(a real stratified space; see [Z4:\u00a7\u00a71,5]), being defined also for non-\n\nHermitian X, are more general. The Borel-Serre spaces have boundary strata of odd\nreal-codimension, so are quite far from being complex-analytic spaces. Nonetheless,\none can view Conjecture A as saying that X\n\nred\n\nis more fundamental than X tor , at\n\nleast as far as homogeneous vector bundles are concerned: if E tor and E\nthe respective bundle extensions of E to X tor and X\nmappings h : X tor \u2192 X\n\nred\n\nred\n\nred\n\ndenote\n\n, then for certain continuous\n\n(described below), one has E tor \u2243 h\u2217 E\n\nwords, E tor is determined as a topological vector bundle by E\n\nred\n\nred\n\n. In other\n\n; their respective\n\nChern classes are correspondingly related.\nA problem in dealing with Conjecture A is that X tor and X\n\nred\n\nare generally so\n\ndifferent. Here, I am thinking beyond the result of Lizhen Ji [J] (in essence, the\nconjecture from [HZ2:(1.5.8)] revised), which implies that the greatest common quotient of X tor and X\n\nred\n\nis the obvious one, namely the Baily-Borel compactification\n\n\u2217\n\nX (see (2.2.18) and (2.3.5)). (Each of X tor and X can be viewed as a resolution of\nX \u2217 , in the senses of complex algebraic varieties and real stratified spaces, resp.) In\n[HZ2:\u00a71], we introduced two auxiliary compactifications of X which we now denote\nX tor,exc and X\n\nexc\n\n, and call the excentric toroidal and Borel-Serre compactifications\n\nrespectively (see our Section 2). They are straightforward quotients of X tor and X\nrespectively, with X\n\nexc\n\nmapping onto X\n\nred\n\n. The two excentric compactifications\n\ncould be seen to have much in common (see, e.g., (2.3.11)). It was a naive suspicion at the time that they might be isomorphic as compactifications of X; it was\nimportant to realize that in general they are not.\nThe goal in [GT] was to determine the least common modification (language as\nin [HZ2:(1.1.4)]) of X\n\nred\n\nand X tor , denoted LCM(X\n\nthe canonical mapping LCM(X\n\nred\n\nred\n\n, X tor). They showed that\n\n, X tor) \u2192 X tor is a homotopy equivalence. Then\n\n\f3\n\nhomotopy inverses are used to yield the mappings h above, via the composite\nX tor \u2192 LCM(X\n\nred\n\nIn this article, we determine that LCM(X\n\n, X tor ) \u2192 X\nexc\n\nred\n\n.\n\n, X tor,exc ) \u2192 X tor,exc is a homotopy\n\nequivalence (Theorem 3.1.1), for more or less the same reason. However, our argument shows that it is a natural consequence of the calculation of the least common\nmodification of dual compactifications of a simplicial cone (1.2) (see also [HZ1: 2.3]).\nWe thereby obtain a homotopy class of mappings k : X tor,exc \u2192 X\n\nexc\n\n. We recover\n\nthe LCM determination from [GT] by considerations of LCM-basechange (1.1.8),\nthe name we give to the determination for three compactifications X1 , X2 , and X3 ,\nwith X3 a quotient of X2 , whether the canonical embedding\nLCM(X1 , X2 ) \u0592\u2192 LCM(X1 , X3 ) \u00d7X3 X2\nis an equality. On the other hand, our theorem does not seem to follow directly\nfrom [GT].\nThe preceding is made more significant by the fact that there is a canonical\nextension E tor,exc of the homogeneous vector bundle E to X tor,exc that pulls back\nto E tor via X tor \u2192 X tor,exc (4.3), and likewise E\nof E\n\nred\n\nvia X\n\nexc\n\n\u2192 X\n\nred\n\nexc\n\non X\n\nexc\n\nthat is the pullback\n\n. We can then formulate the analogue of Conjecture A\n\n(which we tentatively label Conjecture A\u2032 : k \u2217 E\n\nexc\n\n\u2243 E tor,exc ). It is not hard to see\n\nthat Conjecture A is a consequence of Conjecture A\u2032 , but the latter is talking about\nthe pair of excentric compactifications, which more resemble each other. We give a\nproof of Conjecture A\u2032 in the last section of this article.\nThe organization of this article is as follows. In Section 1, we treat the compactifications of a space X as a category in (1.1), in which taking the LCM is a bifunctor.\nParticularly important is the discussion of when LCM-basechange occurs. In (1.2),\nwe make the critical calculation of the LCM of dual compactifications of a simplicial cone. This is followed in (1.3) by a treatment of the somewhat elusive notion\nthat we call diagonality, where the commutation of LCM and discrete quotients is\nanalyzed.\nSection 2 contains a description of the essential features of the various classes of\ncompactifications of a locally symmetric variety: Baily-Borel (2.1), toroidal (2.2),\nand Borel-Serre (2.3). The excentric quotients are recalled in (2.2.18) and (2.3.5).\nIn an appendix, we introduce some additional Borel-Serre quotients (called hybrid\n\n\f4\n\ncompactifications), lying between X\n\nexc\n\nand X\n\nred\n\n, that are inspired by the determi-\n\nnation of the greatest common quotient of X and X tor in [J].\nSection 3 is devoted to the proof of our Theorem 3.1.1, which asserts that\nLCM(X\n\nexc\n\n, X tor,exc ) \u2192 X tor,exc is a homotopy equivalence. We use the outcome of\n\n(1.2) to give in (3.2) an approximation of the proof, revising it at the boundary in\n(3.3). In Sections (3.4) and (3.5), we finish the proof and determine consequences\nthat follow by LCM-basechange. We emphasize the substantial conclusion given in\nCorollary 3.5.11: X\n\nexc\n\nand X tor,exc are homotopy equivalent.\n\nFinally, in Section 4, we carry out the toroidal construction of [AMRT] on (the\ntotal space of) the vector bundle E, yielding a vector bundle E tor on X tor . We\nshow that E tor is the canonical extension of E in the sense of [Mu] in (4.3). (This\nis analogous to what was done in [Z4] to yield E\n\nred\n\n.) We then descend this bundle\n\nto E tor,exc \u2192 X tor,exc . In (4.4), we verify that Conjecture A\u2032 implies the conjecture\nof Goresky-Tai (Conjecture A). We complete the task by verifying Conjecture A\u2032\nin (4.5).\nI want to thank Mark Goresky and Lizhen Ji for helpful correspondence and discussions. The referee is to be commended for his or her thorough job of reading the\nmanuscript, and also for wisely insisting on a substantial revamping of the exposition. To my surprise, it was pointed out by the referee (correctly!) that the verbal\ndescription in the first line of [HZ1: p.262] is a bit garbled; the correct assertion\nwas nearby, though, and it is stated correctly (in slightly different notation) here\nin (2.2).\nApology. It is only a little unnatural that this article is appearing well after its sequel [Z5], which was written for a special volume. The latter is largely independent,\nreferring only to Corollary 3.5.11 for a conditional assertion. There is also reference\nto Corollary 3.5.11 in [Z6: Prop. 2].\nComments on [Z4]. i) Erratum: The quantity \u03b4 in [Z4:(3.1.4)] should be described\nas, and taken to be, the sum of the positive Q-roots, not the half-sum (the \"half\"\nappears as\n\n1\np\n\nwhen p = 2). Subsequent statements involving \u03b4 are correct as written.\n\nii) About the time [Z4] appeared, R. Mazzeo asked a familiar question: \"Why\np\n\nL -cohomology for p 6= 2?\" I think that the article [Z4] provides a good answer. It\nis almost certain that I first tried to calculate the L\u221e -cohomology quickly, finding\nit to be infinite-dimensional. Use of large finite p offers a perturbation away from\nthat difficulty, allowing for our topological interpretation of the Lp -cohomology.\n\n\f5\n\nChanges in notation from [Z4]. The simultaneous treatment of Borel-Serre and\ntoroidal compactifications taxes one's alphabetical resources, as was seen already\nin [HZ2]. Note in particular the following changes of notation:\ni) The unipotent radical of a parabolic subgroup P (formerly UP ) is now denoted\nWP ; the symbol UP is used here for the center of the unipotent radical. This is as\nin [AMRT].\nii) Symmetric spaces (formerly X) are now denoted D; the symbol X is now\nused for the arithmetic quotient \u0393\\D, which was denoted M in [Z4].\niii) The reductive Borel-Serre compactification of X is denoted here X\nmerly M\n\nRBS\n\nred\n\n(for-\n\nof M ). The \"bar\" (overline) always indicates a construction of Borel-\n\nSerre type.\n1. The category of compactifications of a space\nThe main purpose of this section is to recall (cf. [HZ2,\u00a71]) the notion of the least\ncommon modification of two compactifications of the same topological space, and\nto develop properties that this notion has when a third compactification is invoked.\n(1.1) Fundamentals. We begin with some basic terminology. Let X be a\nlocally compact Hausdorff space (non-compact) with a countable base for its topology. One defines a category Cp(X), the compactifications of X, as follows. The\nobjects are pairs (Y, \u03b9), with Y a compact Hausdorff space, and \u03b9 : X \u2192 Y a dense\nopen embedding. We will write just Y when \u03b9 is understood, and view X as a\nsubset of Y . The interior of Y is then understood to be X; the boundary \u2202Y of\nY (qua compactification of X) is the complement of X in Y , a closed subset of Y .\nTo eliminate pathology, we will assume throughout this article that we allow only\nspaces Y (thus also X) whose topologies have countable neighborhood bases. This\nholds in particular whenever Y , hence also X, is metrizable.\nA morphism in Cp(X), called a morphism of compactifications of X, from (Y1 , \u03b91 )\nto (Y2 , \u03b92 ), is a commutative triangle of continuous mappings:\nX\n\n\u03b9\n\n1\n\u2212\u2192\nY\uf8e61\n\uf8e6\n\u0581 y\n\n\u03b92\n\nY2\n\nNote that there is at most one morphism from Y1 to Y2 , as X is dense in Y1 , and\nthat morphisms in Cp(X) are surjective by compactness. There is such a morphism\n\n\f6\n\nif and only if Y2 is a topological quotient of Y1 at its boundary (so \u2202Y1 maps onto\n\u2202Y2 ) . If so, one also says that Y1 is a modification of Y2 .\nThe set of compactifications of X can be seen to form a (non-distributive) lattice.\nSpecifically, for Y1 and Y2 as above, one takes Y1 \u2228 Y2 to be the closure of X\n(equivalently, any dense subset of X) under the diagonal embedding in Y1 \u00d7 Y2 .\nThis is the least common modification of the two compactifications, and is also\ndenoted LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) or LCMX (Y1 , Y2 ); it admits canonical morphisms to Y1 and\nY2 . The notion passes to the set of homeomorphism classes of compactifications.\nSimilarly, one takes Y1 \u2227 Y2 to be the greatest common quotient GCQ(Y1 , Y2 ) of Y1\nand Y2 , which can be realized as the inverse limit of all common quotients of Y1 and\nY2 (the set of such is non-empty, for the one-point compactification of X is always\na quotient of both). It receives canonical morphisms from Y1 and Y2 .\nLemma 1.1.1. In Cp(X), the following three statements are equivalent:\ni) There is a morphism Y1 \u2192 Y2 .\nii) Via the natural projection, LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) \u2243 Y1 .\niii) Via the quotient mapping, GCQ(Y1 , Y2 ) \u2243 Y2 .\n\n\u0003\n\nIt is useful to introduce the category PCp(X) of partial compactifications of X,\nwhich contains Cp(X) as a full subcategory. A partial compactification of X is a\nspace Y (not necessarily compact) containing X as a dense open subset. In particular, X itself is an object in PCp(X). The notions of boundary, morphism and\nLCM can be extended verbatim to PCp(X), though morphisms need not be surjective (thus are not necessarily quotient mappings). Moreover, GCQ(Y1 , Y2 ) need\nnot be defined, for Y1 and Y2 may have no common quotients at all. Nonetheless,\nthe following version of Lemma 1.1.1 holds in PCp(X):\nLemma 1.1.1.1. Let Y1 , Y2 \u2208 PCp(X).\ni) There is a morphism Y1 \u2192 Y2 if and only if, via the natural projection,\nLCM(Y1 , Y2 ) \u2243 Y1 .\nii) There is a surjective morphism Y1 \u2192 Y2 if and only if GCQ(Y1 , Y2 ) exists\nand is isomorphic to Y2 via the natural mapping, Y2 \u2192 GCQ(Y1 , Y2 ).\n\n\u0003\n\n(1.1.1.2) Example. Let X be the interval (0, 1), Y1 = (0, 1] and Y2 = [0, 1). One\nhas LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) \u2243 X. In particular, the canonical morphisms, LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) \u2192 Yi\n(i = 1, 2), are not surjective. Also, GCQ(Y1 , Y2 ) is not defined.\n\n\f7\n\nIn the sequel, we will concern ourselves only with the LCM. Also, until stated\notherwise, assertions are given for PCp(X). The following is elementary:\nLemma 1.1.2. In PCp(X), LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) is equal to\n{(y1 , y2 ) \u2208 Y1 \u00d7 Y2 | \u2203 a sequence {xj } in X with \u03b91 (xj ) \u2192 y1 , \u03b92 (xj ) \u2192 y2 }.\n\n\u0003\n\n(1.1.3) Remark. When we want to draw more attention to the role of the boundaries\n\u22021 and \u22022 of Y1 and Y2 respectively, we renotate \u2202LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) as LCMb(\u22021 , \u22022 )\n(\"b\" as in \"boundary\"); in general, whenever we write LCMb(\u22021 , \u22022 ), X and the\nway that \u22021 and \u22022 are attached to X are understood to be given information.\nIt is easy to see:\nProposition 1.1.4. Let Y1 , Y2 and Z be partial compactifications of X, such that\nY1 and Y2 admit morphisms to Z. Then LCM (Y1 , Y2 ) maps to Z, and the following\ndiagram commutes\nLCM(Y1 , Y2 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\nY1\n\n\u03c61\n\nY2\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03c62\ny\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Z\n\nIn other words, LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) \u2286 Y1 \u00d7Z Y2 \u2282 Y1 \u00d7 Y2 .\nProof. Let {xj } be a sequence as in Lemma 1.1.2. Then by continuity, {\u03c6i (xj )}\nconverges to \u03c6i (yi ) \u2208 Z for both i = 1 and i = 2, and our assertion follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nAs such, we have\nCorollary 1.1.5. In the situation of Proposition 1.1.4, let z \u2208 Z. Let U be a\nclosed neighborhood of z in Z. Let Y1 (U ) denote the subset of Y1 lying over U , and\ndo likewise for Y2 and LCM(Y1 , Y2 ). Then\nLCM(Y1 , Y2 )(U ) = LCM(Y1 (U ), Y2 (U )).\n\n\u0003\n\nIn particular, the fiber LCM(Y1 , Y2 )z can be determined from data over any neighborhood of z.\nNext, suppose there is a morphism, \u03c6 : Y1 \u2192 Y2 , and let Y3 be any third element\nof PCp(X). The induced mapping \u03c6 \u00d7 1 : Y1 \u00d7 Y3 \u2192 Y2 \u00d7 Y3 induces a morphism\nLCM(Y1 , Y3 ) \u2192 LCM(Y2 , Y3 ). It is important to recognize that there are no general\n\n\f8\n\npullback properties in this situation, even in Cp(X). Under the above conditions,\none always has\n(1.1.6)\n\nLCM(Y1 , Y3 ) \u2286 Y1 \u00d7Y2 LCM(Y2 , Y3 ),\n\nbut equality can fail. In other words, the commutative diagram\nLCM(Y1 , Y3 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 LCM(Y2 , Y3 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03c0\n\uf8e6\n\u03c01 y\ny 2\nY1\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nY2\n\nneed not be Cartesian, even in Cp(X).\n(1.1.7) Example. A standard situation in which equality in (1.1.6) fails is given\nby taking a morphism Y1 \u2192 Y2 in Cp(X), and letting Y3 = Y1 . Then Y1 \u00d7Y2\nLCM(Y2 , Y3 ) = Y1 \u00d7Y2 Y1 , but LCM(Y1 , Y3 ) is just Y1 . Indeed, equality holds in\n(1.1.6) if and only if Y1 \u2243 Y2 . (We add that it is easy to find examples in PCp(X)\nof the preceding sort where equality in (1.1.6) holds without Y1 \u2243 Y2 . Indeed, take\nY1 and Y2 as in (1.1.1.2), and Y3 = Y2 .)\n(1.1.8) Definition. We will say that LCM-basechange holds for Y3 with respect to\nY1 \u2192 Y2 when we have equality in (1.1.6), i.e., LCM(Y1 , Y3 ) = Y1 \u00d7Y2 LCM(Y2 , Y3 ).\nWhen we want to emphasize the role of the boundaries (the notion is trivial on\nX) as in (1.1.3), we will say that LCMb-basechange holds for \u2202Y3 with respect to\n\u2202Y1 \u2192 \u2202Y2 .\nWhen this is the case, the fiber of \u03c01 at y \u2208 Y1 is canonically homeomorphic to the\nfiber of \u03c02 at \u03c6(y).\n(1.1.9) Remark. In terms of sequences, as in (1.1.2), LCM-basechange is equivalent\nto the following. Given a sequence in X with limit y2 \u2208 Y2 and limit y3 \u2208 Y3 ,\nthen for any y1 \u2208 Y1 that maps to y2 \u2208 Y2 , there is a sequence in X converging to\ny1 \u2208 Y1 (so to y2 \u2208 Y2 ) and to y3 \u2208 Y3 .\nWe have the following complement to Corollary 1.1.5:\nProposition 1.1.10. In the situation of Proposition 1.1.4,\nLCM(Y1 , Y2 )z \u2286 (Y1 )z \u00d7 (Y2 )z ,\nwith equality for all z \u2208 Z if and only if LCM-basechange holds for Y1 with respect\nto Y2 \u2192 Z.\n\n\f9\n\nProof. We note that by (1.1.6), LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) \u2286 LCM(Y1 , Z) \u00d7Z Y2 = Y1 \u00d7Z Y2 ,\nwith equality if and only if the LCM-basechange assertion holds. The fiber of this\nover z is the same as that in the statement of the proposition.\n\n\u0003\n\nExample (1.1.7) and the failure of surjectivity in morphisms in PCp(X) suggest\nthat we return to Cp(X) as setting for the rest of this Section. We next assert:\nProposition 1.1.11 (LCM-basechange in a tower). Let Y \u2032\u2032 \u2192 Y \u2032 \u2192 Y be morphisms of compactifications of X, and Z a fourth compactification of X. Then\nLCM-basechange holds for Z with respect to Y \u2032\u2032 \u2192 Y if and only if LCM-basechange\nholds for Z with respect to both Y \u2032\u2032 \u2192 Y \u2032 and Y \u2032 \u2192 Y .\nProof. From (1.1.6), we always have\n(1.1.11.1) LCM(Y \u2032\u2032 , Z) \u2286 LCM(Y \u2032 , Z) \u00d7Y \u2032 Y \u2032\u2032\n\u2286 (LCM(Y, Z) \u00d7Y Y \u2032 ) \u00d7Y \u2032 Y \u2032\u2032 = LCM(Y, Z) \u00d7Y Y \u2032\u2032 .\nWe see that there is equality of the ends if and only if we have equality at both\ninclusion symbols. This gives our assertion. \u0003\nOne can also talk about two-sided LCM-basechange. Let Y \u2032 \u2192 Y and Z \u2032 \u2192 Z\nbe morphisms of compactifications of X. There is an embedding\n(1.1.12)\n\nLCM(Y \u2032 , Z \u2032 ) \u2286 Y \u2032 \u00d7Y LCM(Y, Z) \u00d7Z Z \u2032 ,\n\nthrough which the embedding LCM(Y \u2032 , Z \u2032 ) \u2286 Y \u2032 \u00d7 Z \u2032 factors.\nProposition 1.1.13. Under the conditions of (1.1.12), equality holds in (1.1.12)\nif and only if LCM-basechange holds for Z and Z \u2032 with respect to Y \u2032 \u2192 Y and for\nY and Y \u2032 with respect to Z \u2032 \u2192 Z.\nProof. This follows immediately from an elementary fact about fiber products: if\nA and B map to Z, and S is a proper subset of A, then S \u00d7Z B is a proper subset\nof A \u00d7Z B. \u0003\n(1.1.13.1) Remark. It is always the case that in the situation of (1.1.12),\nLCM(Y \u2032 , Z \u2032 ) \u2243 LCM(LCM(Y, Z \u2032 ), LCM(Y \u2032 , Z)).\nWe give one instance of a simple and useful criterion for LCM-basechange. We\nreturn to the situation of (1.1.6).\n\n\f10\n\nProposition 1.1.14. Let Y1 , Y2 , Y3 \u2208 Cp(X), with morphism Y1 \u2192 Y2 . Suppose\nthat the compact Lie group H acts on the pairs (Y1 , X) and (Y3 , X), in such a way\nthat H\\\u2202Y1 \u2243 \u2202Y2 . If H acts trivially on \u2202Y3 , then LCM-basechange holds for Y3\nwith respect to Y1 \u2192 Y2 .\nProof. This is basically (1.1.9). We have that LCM(Y1 , Y3 ) \u2192 LCM(Y2 , Y3 ) is\nsurjective. If a sequence {xj } in X satisfies xj \u2192 y2 in Y2 and xj \u2192 y3 in Y3 , a\nsubsequence converges to some y1 \u2208 Y1 , and then y1 maps to y2 . Then for h \u2208 H,\nhxj \u2192 hy1 in Y1 ; whereas in Y3 , hxj \u2192 hy3 = y3 . \u0003\nIt is also possible for the opposite of LCM-basechange to occur. That happens\nwhenever there is a morphism of compactifications Y3 \u2192 Y1 (cf. (1.1.7)). More\ngenerally, one has:\nProposition 1.1.15. In the situation of (1.1.6), LCM(Y1 , Y3 ) \u2192 LCM(Y2 , Y3 ) is\nan isomorphism if and only if the canonical mapping LCM(Y2 , Y3 ) \u2192 Y2 factors\nthrough Y1 .\nProof. We are in the situation\nLCM(Y1 , Y3 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 LCM(Y2 , Y3 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\ny\nY1\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nY2\n\nWhen the top arrow is an isomorphism, its inverse can be used to define the factorization. Conversely, if we have a morphism LCM(Y2 , Y3 ) \u2192 Y1 , use that with\nthe canonical mapping LCM(Y2 , Y3 ) \u2192 Y3 , to give a morphism LCM(Y2 , Y3 ) \u2192\nLCM(Y1 , Y3 ). There is a canonical morphism in the opposite direction. This gives\nthe isomorphism we were seeking. \u0003\nFinally, we state a simple assertion that involves a second initial space:\nProposition 1.1.16. Let X \u2032 be a space with a proper surjection f : X \u2032 \u2192 X. Suppose that Y1 and Y2 are compactifications of X and Y1\u2032 and Y2\u2032 compactifications of\nX \u2032 for which f extends to mappings f1 : (Y1\u2032 , \u2202Y1\u2032 ) \u2192 (Y1 , \u2202Y1 ) and f2 : (Y2\u2032 , \u2202Y2\u2032 ) \u2192\n(Y2 , \u2202Y2 ). Then the induced mapping LCM(Y1\u2032 , Y2\u2032 ) \u2192 LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) is surjective.\nProof. If {xj } is a sequence converging in both Y1 and Y2 , lift it to a sequence {x\u2032j }\nin X \u2032 . The hypotheses implies that {x\u2032j } has a subsequence that converges in both\nY1\u2032 and Y2\u2032 . We are done by Lemma 1.1.2. \u0003\n\n\f11\n\n(1.2) Example: Two compactifications of a simplicial cone. The following is an essential calculation, one that underlies [HZ1, 2.3], [HZ2, (1.5)], [GT,\u00a77],\nand what is to come in this article.\nLet \u03c3 be a closed simplicial cone that spans a real vector space of dimension\nd. When convenient, we will understand that the origin has been removed. Let\n\u03c3\nb denote the quotient of \u03c3 by cone dilations, a simplex that we can identify with\nany cross-section of \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3\nb. Let {qj } be a set of d linear functionals that are\nnon-negative in \u03c3 and whose zero-loci define the codimension-one faces of \u03c3. These\n\nwill be called linear coordinates on \u03c3; they induce barycentric coordinates on \u03c3\nb. A\nchoice of cross-section enables us to write \u03c3 \u2243 \u03c3\nb \u00d7 (0, \u221e) in the usual way. We\n\ncompactify \u03c3 to \u03c3 1 by taking \u03c3 1 \u2243 \u03c3\nb \u00d7 (0, \u221e]; thus, \u2202\u03c3 1 \u2243 \u03c3\nb.\n\nA second compactification \u03c3 2 of \u03c3 is obtained by converting to toroidal coordi-\n\nnates, by putting tj = exp(\u2212qj ). This sets up a homeomorphism \u03c3 \u2243 (0, 1]d, to\nwhich we attach the boundary that yields \u03c3 2 \u2243 [0, 1]d . Then in toroidal coordinates\n\u2202\u03c3 2 \u2243 {x \u2208 [0, 1]d : tj = 0 for some j} \u2243\n\n[\n\n{\u03c4 \u2228 (b\n\u03c3 ) : \u03c4b is a face of \u03c3\nb},\n\nwhere \u03c4 \u2228 (b\n\u03c3 ) is the closed polyhedral face of \u03c3 2 dual to \u03c4b. For \u03c4 a proper face of\n\u03c3, we define \u03c4 2 to be the result of the preceding construction when one considers \u03c4\n\nas a subset of the linear space it spans. This allows us to regard \u03c4 2 naturally as a\nsubset of \u03c3 2 .\nIt is our present goal to determine LCM(\u03c3 1 , \u03c32 ).\nProposition 1.2.1. The complement of \u03c3 in LCM(\u03c3 1 , \u03c3 2 ) \u2282 \u03c3 1 \u00d7 \u03c3 2 is given by\n(1.2.1.1)\n\nLCMb(b\n\u03c31 , \u2202\u03c32 ) = \u2202LCM(\u03c3 1 , \u03c3 2 ) =\n\n[\n\n{b\n\u03c4 \u00d7 \u03c4 \u2228 (b\n\u03c3 ) : \u03c4b is a face of \u03c3\nb}.\n\nProof. We make use of Lemma 1.1.1, together with the simple observation that qj\ngoes to \u221e if and only if tj \u2192 0. For each subset J of {1, 2, ..., d}, a face \u03c4 = \u03c4J of \u03c3\nP\nis defined by the equations qj = 0 for all j \u2208 J. Put S = 1\u2264j\u2264d qj , and note that\nfor all j, the ratio qbj := qj /S takes values in [0, 1]. Suppose that {qk } is a sequence\n\nin the cone \u03c3 that converges to a boundary point q\u221e \u2208 \u03c3\nb = \u2202\u03c3 1 . Then q\u221e lies\n\nin the interior \u03c4bJ\u25e6 of \u03c4bJ for a uniquely determined J. This implies for the sequence\n\n{qk } that S \u2192 \u221e, and thus the linear coordinates qj \u2192 \u221e for all j \u2208\n/ J. In toroidal\ncoordinates, we have that tj \u2192 0 for all j \u2208\n/ J. As the face \u03c4J\u2228 in \u2202\u03c3 2 dual to \u03c4bJ\n\nis defined by the equations tj = 0 for all j \u2208\n/ J, we see that the right-hand side of\n(1.2.1.1) contains the boundary of LCM(\u03c3 1 , \u03c3 2 ).\n\n\f12\n\nTo see that one gets every point of the latter space in the boundary, it suffices to\nexhibit a suitable family of curves in \u03c3. For each J, consider the family of curves\nqJ (s) given in linear coordinates by\n(1.2.1.2)\n\nqj (s) =\n\n\u001a\n\ns qj,0 if j \u2208\n/ J,\nqj,0 if j \u2208 J,\n\nwith qj,0 \u2208 R\u22650 for all j. The limit in \u03c3 1 , as s \u2192 \u221e, is the point of \u03c4bJ \u00d7 {\u221e} with\n\nbarycentric coordinates qbj = 0 if j \u2208 J, and qbj = qbj,0 if j \u2208\n/ J; in \u03c3 2 , it is the point\nof \u03c4J\u2228 with toroidal coordinates tj = exp(\u2212qj,0 ) if j \u2208 J, and tj = 0 if j \u2208\n/ J. Thus,\nall of \u03c4b \u00d7 \u03c4 \u2228 (b\n\u03c3 ) is reached.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe illustrate of the above when \u03c3 is of dimension d = 2. Let q0 and q1 be the\n\nnon-negative linear functionals that define the edges of \u03c3. We sketch four cone\ndilation orbits and a curve t1 = const (where q1 is constant, so qb1 \u2192 0), which is\nof the sort given in (1.2.1.2), in both \u03c3 1 and \u03c3 2 :\n\n(1.2.2)\n(1.2.3) Remarks. i) We can write (1.2.1.1) as\n(1.2.3.1)\n\nLCMb(b\n\u03c31 , \u2202\u03c32 ) =\n\n[\n\n{b\n\u03c4 \u25e6 \u00d7 \u03c4 \u2228 (b\n\u03c3 ) : \u03c4b is a face of \u03c3\nb},\n\nwhere \u03c4b\u25e6 denotes the interior of \u03c4b, consisting of those points in \u03c4b that do not belong\nto any proper face.\n\nii) It is not hard to see that the greatest common quotient of \u03c3 1 and \u03c3 2 is the\none-point compactification of \u03c3.\nThe picture that follows has been used in [HZ1: 2.3] and elsewhere, and will be\nused in the present work.\nConstruction 1.2.4. There are quasi-canonical homeomorphisms of \u2202\u03c3 2 and a\n(cubical) polyhedral decomposition P (b\n\u03c3 ) of \u03c3\nb that subdivides further to the barycen-\n\ntric subdivision of \u03c3\nb.\n\nTo see this, one notes that \u2202\u03c3 2 is union of the d closed faces that pass through\n\nthe origin of [0, 1]d . The barycentric subdivision of \u03c3\nb consists of taking all simplices\nspanned by the barycenters of a chain of faces of \u03c3\nb:\n\n(1.2.4.1)\n\n\u03c41 \u2282 \u03c42 \u2282 ... \u2282 \u03c4m ;\n\n\f13\n\nFor the polyhedral complex, one takes only those chains where the codimension of\neach face in the next in (1.2.4.1) is equal to one. Removing the rest of the faces\nyields the polyhedral decomposition. The construction of a homeomorphism can\nbe done recursively, by doing it first on all maximal faces, and then adjoining the\norigin of the cube and the barycenter of \u03c3\nb. If one subdivides \u2202\u03c3 2 first, one can\n\ntreat the tj 's as \"linear\" and make the homeomorphism simplicial and equivariant\nunder permutation of the variables. The specification of the functionals qj , which\nare unique up to positive scalars, determine this mapping uniquely.\nThe picture looks like a small piece of a Voronoi decomposition (see [N: p.98]).\nFor a 2-simplex in the boundary when d = 3, the picture for P (b\n\u03c3 ) is:\n(1.2.4.2)\n\n(1.3) Discrete quotients and diagonality. We next consider the situation\nwhere there is a discrete group action, and the effect of that on LCM's.\nLet D be a space on which a discrete group \u0393 acts. Let E be a partial compactification of D to which the action of \u0393 extends continuously. We suppose that the\naction on E (so also its restriction to D) is separated and discontinuous, by which\nwe mean that the following two conditions hold:\ni) if y \u2208 E is not a \u0393-translate of x, then there are neighborhoods Ux of x and\nUy of y with Uy \u2229 (\u0393 * Ux ) = \u2205.\nii) if x \u2208 E, there is a neighborhood Ux of x in E such that if \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 and \u03b3 *x \u2208 Ux\nthen \u03b3 * x = x.\nSuppose we have two such E-call them E1 and E2 . Then \u0393\u00d7\u0393 acts on E1 \u00d7E2 .\nThe diagonal \u2206(\u0393), which we identify with \u0393, is easily seen to preserve the subset\nLCM(E1 , E2 ). The projections of LCM(E1 , E2 ) onto E1 and E2 are equivariant\nfor the \u0393-actions. Moreover, via either projection, one can easily deduce that the\naction on LCM(E1 , E2 ) is separated and discontinuous. We want a little more.\n(1.3.1) Definition. i) We say that the actions of \u0393 on E1 and E2 are diagonal when\nthe following holds: if (e1 , e2 ) \u2208 LCM(E1 , E2 ) and (\u03b31 * e1 , \u03b32 * e2 ) \u2208 LCM(E1 , E2 )\nfor some \u03b31 , \u03b32 \u2208 \u0393, then there exists \u03b4 \u2208 \u2206(\u0393) with \u03b4 * e1 = \u03b31 * e1 and \u03b4 * e2 = \u03b32 e2 ;\nequivalently, if (e1 , e2 ) \u2208 LCM(E1 , E2 ) and (\u03b3 * e1 , e2 ) \u2208 LCM(E1 , E2 ), there exists\n\u03b4 \u2208 \u2206(\u0393) with e1 = (\u03b4\u03b3) * e1 and e2 = \u03b4 * e2 , i.e., (\u03b3 * e1 , e2 ) = \u03b4 * (e1 , e2 ).\nii) We say that the actions of \u0393 on E1 and E2 are strongly diagonal when the\n\n\f14\n\nfollowing holds: if (e1 , e2 ) \u2208 LCM(E1 , E2 ) and (\u03b3 * e1 , e2 ) \u2208 LCM(E1 , E2 ), then\n\u03b3 * e1 = e1 or \u03b3 * e2 = e2 .\nStrongly diagonal actions are diagonal. We also say that diagonality holds under\nthe conditions of (1.3.1). We prefer strong diagonality in the sequel. It is easy to\nsee that diagonality is not affected by switching E1 and E2 . We will give a rather\nsimple, and quite pertinent, example of non-diagonal actions in (1.3.6) below.\n(1.3.2) Remark. It is easy to see that if there is a \u0393-equivariant morphism E1 \u2192 E2\nin PCp(D), then LCM(E1 , E2 ) \u2243 E1 is diagonal.\nAs the non-trivial issues lie at the boundaries of E1 and E2 , we also speak of\nboundary diagonality, in the spirit of the notion of LCMb(E1 , E2 ) from (1.1.3).\nA little surprisingly, the useful properties of diagonality that we have found are\nset-theoretical, i.e., not topological in nature. We therefore make the following\ngeneralization of (1.3.1):\n(1.3.3) Definition. Let E and E \u2032 be sets given with actions by a group \u0393, so that\nthere is a natural action of \u0393\u00d7\u0393-action on E \u00d7E \u2032 . Let B be a \u2206(\u0393)-invariant subset\nof E \u00d7 E \u2032 . We say that B is diagonal if (e, e\u2032 ), (\u03b3 * e, e\u2032 ) \u2208 B implies that \u03b3 * e = e\nor \u03b3 * e\u2032 = e\u2032 . In other words, on B, \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393-equivalence reduces to \u2206(\u0393)-equivalence.\nThe following is immediate:\nLemma 1.3.4. i) Let B1 \u2282 B2 be \u2206(\u0393)-invariant subsets of E1 \u00d7 E2 , with B2\ndiagonal. Then B1 is also diagonal.\nii) Let \u0393\u2032 \u2282 \u0393. If B is diagonal for \u0393, it is diagonal for \u0393\u2032 .\n\n\u0003\n\nIn the original setting of E, E \u2032 \u2208 PCp(D), we understand that B = LCM(E, E \u2032 )\nin (1.3.3) unless stated otherwise.\n(1.3.5) Remark. We comment on diagonality in an important setting related to\nLCM-basechange. Let \u0393 be a group acting on sets E1 , E2 and E3 . Assume that\na \u0393-equivariant mapping E3 \u2192 E1 is specified. We now take E1 \u00d7 E2 to have the\ndiagonal \u0393-action. Consider the mappings\n(1.3.5.1)\n\nE3 \u00d7E1 (E1 \u00d7 E2 ) \u2282 E3 \u00d7 (E1 \u00d7 E2 ) \u2192 (E3 \u00d7 E2 ) \u2192 (E1 \u00d7 E2 ).\n\nThe projection E3 \u00d7 (E1 \u00d7 E2 ) \u2192 E3 \u00d7 E2 is (\u0393 \u00d7 \u0393)-equivariant; however, the\nsubset E3 \u00d7E1 (E1 \u00d7 E2 ) of the domain is only \u2206(\u0393)-invariant. It is not true, for\ninstance, that B diagonal in E1 \u00d7 E2 implies E3 \u00d7E1 B diagonal in E3 \u00d7 E2 .\n\n\f15\n\nWe give next an example of a pair of actions that are non-diagonal in the sense\nof (1.3.1), one that fits well with the considerations of (3.2):\n(1.3.6) Example. Let E1 be the real line, partitioned at the integer points. This\ngives a one-dimensional simplicial complex with 1-simplices [n, n + 1] for all n \u2208 Z.\nThe group \u0393 = Z acts on E1 in the usual way, by translation. Let E2 be the dual\ncell complex, which is R with 1-cells [n \u2212 21 , n + 12 ], with the same \u0393-action. Let\nB=\n\n[\n\n{\u03c4 \u00d7 \u03c4 \u2228 : \u03c4 = [n, n + 1], n \u2208 Z}\n\n(cf. (1.2.3.1)). Then the points (0, 21 ) and (1, 12 ) are in B, though 1 is a \u0393-translate\nof 0, and \u0393 has no fixed points in either E1 or E2 . Note, however, that B is diagonal\nfor the action of, say, 2Z.\nThe next assertion covers a rather common situation.\nProposition 1.3.7 (Diagonality and products). Let D = D1 \u00d7 D2 , the product\nof two spaces. Suppose that the discrete group \u0393 = \u03931 \u22ca \u03932 (semi-direct product,\n\u03931 normal in \u0393) acts factorwise on D. Let E = E1 \u00d7 E2 and E \u2032 = E1\u2032 \u00d7 E2\u2032 ,\nfor \u03931 -equivariant E1 , E1\u2032 \u2208 PCp(D1 ), and \u03932 -equivariant E2 , E2\u2032 \u2208 PCp(D2 ).\nAssume that diagonality holds for the actions of \u03931 on E1 and E1\u2032 , and for the\nactions of \u03932 on E2 and E2\u2032 . Then the actions of \u0393 on E and E \u2032 are diagonal, and LCM(\u0393\\E, \u0393\\E \u2032 ) \u2243 \u0393\\LCM(E, E \u2032 ) is a \u03932 \\LCM(E2 , E2\u2032 )-fibration over\n\u03931 \\LCM(E1 , E1\u2032 ).\nProof. We begin by taking the \u03932 -quotients. That gives at once (one can use\nLemma 1.1.2):\nLCM(E1 \u00d7 (\u03932 \\E2 ), E1\u2032 \u00d7 (\u03932 \\E2\u2032 )) \u2243 LCM(E1 , E1\u2032 ) \u00d7 LCM((\u03932 \\E2 ), (\u03932 \\E2\u2032 ))\n\u2243 \u03932 \\LCM(E, E \u2032 ).\nTaking the quotient by \u0393/\u03932 \u2243 \u03931 (isomorphism of groups), we obtain the result. \u0003\nThe following extension of Proposition 1.1.16 combines the above notions, and\nis tailored to our later needs in \u00a73:\nProposition 1.3.8. Let D be a space with a separated discontinuous action of a\ndiscrete group \u0393, and let X = \u0393\\D. Suppose that E1 and E2 are partial compactifications of D, yielding spaces for which the \u0393 actions are diagonal. Assume that\nthere is a subset S of D that maps onto X, and whose respective closures S1 , S2 in\n\n\f16\n\nE1 and E2 are compact; thus Y1 = \u0393\\E1 and Y2 = \u0393\\E2 are compactifications of\nX. Then the canonical mapping\n\u0393\\LCM(E1 , E2 ) \u2192 LCM(Y1 , Y2 )\n(where \u0393 acts on LCM(E1 , E2 ) as \u2206(\u0393)) is a homeomorphism.\nProof. Let {xj } be a sequence in X that converges in both Y1 and Y2 . The existence\nof S allows the lifting of {xj } to S, such that a subsequence converges in S1 and\nS2 , a fortiori in E1 and E2 . Thus LCM(E1 , E2 ) \u2192 LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) is surjective. We\nwish to show that the fibers are \u2206(\u0393)-equivalence classes. So, suppose that (e1 , e2 )\nand (e\u20321 , e\u20322 ) have the same image in LCM(Y1 , Y2 ). Then e\u20321 = \u03b31 * e1 and e\u20322 = \u03b32 * e2\nfor \u03b31 , \u03b32 \u2208 \u0393. By diagonality, we can take \u03b31 = \u03b32 , and we are done.\n\n\u0003\n\n2. Locally-symmetric varieties and their compactifications\nIn this section we present key elements of the structure of the relevant compactifications of locally symmetric varieties. (A list of notational changes from [Z4] is\nprovided at the end of the introduction.)\n(2.1) Boundary components and the Baily-Borel compactification. Let\nG be a semi-simple algebraic group defined over the rational number field Q. For\nP a parabolic subgroup of G/Q (Q-parabolic subgroup; we will henceforth suppress\nthe \"Q\"), let WP denote the unipotent radical of P . The Levi quotient of P is\nP red = P/WP , and the projection P \u2192 P red is split by a choice of Levi subgroup\nLP \u2282 P .\nLet D be the symmetric space of non-compact type associated to G(R). For\neach parabolic subgroup P , its real points act transitively on D. Unless specified\notherwise, we assume throughout that G(R) is of Hermitian type, i.e., that D has a\nG(R)-invariant complex structure.\nWe further assume that G is (almost) simple over Q. Then for each maximal\nparabolic P , LP is an almost-direct product of two groups, commonly denoted Gh,P\nand Gl,P after [AMRT: p.209]. The rational boundary component DP of D that is\nnormalized by P is biholomorphic to the Hermitian symmetric space associated to\nGh,P . On the other hand, the group Gl,P (rarely of Hermitian type) acts trivially\non DP , as does WP . The set\n(2.1.1)\n\nD\u2217 = D \u2294\n\nG\n\n{DP : P is maximal parabolic}\n\n\f17\n\nhas a canonical G(Q)-action. It is given the G(Q)-equivariant Satake topology [S,\u00a72]\n(see [Z3:(3.9)]).\nThe Q-root system of G is of classification type BC or C [BB:2.9], whose Dynkin\ndiagram is a linear graph with distinguished end. The set \u2206 of simple roots is thus\ntotally ordered by specifying the root at the distinguished end to be the minimal\nelement. In a standard lattice of parabolic subgroups, the specification of a maximal parabolic subgroup P is equivalent to selecting one simple root \u03b2P \u2208 \u2206; the\ncorrespondence is: the root space for a root \u03b2 is contained in WP if and only if\n\u03b2P occurs with positive coefficient in the expansion of \u03b2. One says that Q \u227a P\nwhenever \u03b2Q \u227a \u03b2P . Moreover, the Dynkin diagram for Gh,P is the segment \u2206h,P\nof type (B)C below \u03b2P (in the total ordering), and that of Gl,P is the segment \u2206l,P\nof type A above \u03b2P . Thus, one can assert:\nProposition 2.1.2. When G is simple over Q, the following are equivalent for\nmaximal parabolic subgroups: (i) Q \u227a P , (ii) DQ is a boundary component of\nDP , (iii) Gh,Q \u2282 Gh,P , (iv) Gl,Q \u2283 Gl,P .\n\n\u0003\n\nLet \u0393 \u2282 G(Q) be an arithmetic subgroup. We assume throughout that \u0393 is neat,\ni.e., that for every algebraic subquotient group H of G, the induced subquotient of\n\u0393, denoted \u0393(H) (instead of the \"\u0393H \" that appears frequently in the literature), is\ntorsion-free. The latter for H = G already gives that the quotient space X = \u0393\\D,\ncalled a locally-symmetric (or arithmetic) variety, is non-singular. We are interested\nin some of its compactifications.\nThe Baily-Borel Satake compactification of X is\n(2.1.3)\n\nX \u2217 = \u0393\\D\u2217 ,\n\nhomeomorphic in the sense of (1.1) to the Satake compactification of X that is\nparametrized by the root at the distinguished end (see [Z3:(3.9)]). It is shown in\n[BB] that X \u2217 is a projective algebraic variety (of which X is the regular locus),\nwhence the word \"variety\" in the name for X. The decomposition (2.1.1) induces\na stratification of (2.1.3) as follows. For P as above, a boundary stratum\n(2.1.4)\n\nMP = \u0393(P )\\DP\n\nof X \u2217 is induced by the inclusion DP \u2282 D\u2217 in (2.1.1). For Q \u227a P , MQ lies in\nthe closure of MP in X \u2217 , the latter giving the Baily-Borel compactification MP\u2217\nof MP . The quotient by \u0393 identifies the boundary components of \u0393-conjugate\n\n\f18\n\nP 's, so boundary strata in X \u2217 are parametrized by \u0393-conjugacy classes of maximal\nparabolic subgroups, and these are finite in number.\n(2.2) Toroidal compactifications and their quotients. The toroidal compactifications X tor of [AMRT] are predicated on the notion that they will map to\nthe Baily-Borel compactification X \u2217 . As the construction is rather complicated, we\ngive here only a brief description, referring to the literature for details.\nFor P maximal parabolic, the center UP of WP plays a key role in the construction; the quotient VP = WP /UP is commutative and even-dimensional, as follows\nfrom the root structure. It is elementary but fundamental that UQ \u2283 UP whenever\nQ \u227a P (there is no corresponding assertion for the whole unipotent radical).\nFor each P , there is a tower of quotient mappings of groups\n(2.2.1)\n\nP \u2032 = Gh,P (R)WP (R)UP (C) \u2192 Gh,P (R)VP (R) \u2192 Gh,P (R).\n\nThese act homogeneously on a tower of spaces \u010e(P ) \u2192 DPA \u2192 DP , with common\nisotropy subgroup Kh,P , which is maximal compact in Gh,P (R). From (2.2.1)\nand the Cayley transform associated to P comes the Siegel domain picture of D\nrelative to DP (see [AMRT:III,\u00a74], and also our (4.1)). Then, dividing out the\nrespective actions of \u0393(Gh,P WP ), \u0393(Gh,P VP ), and \u0393(Gh,P ), one gets the basic\ntower (essentially of mixed Shimura varieties; see [HZ1:1.6]):\n(2.2.2)\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\n1\nMP\u2032 \u2212\u2192\nAP \u2212\u2192\nMP .\n\n(The use of \"prime\" in M \u2032 and P \u2032 differs from convention that begins in (2.3).)\nWe underscore the absence of Gl,P in (2.2.1). (It disappears through inclusion\nin the isotropy subgroup for a suitable basepoint at infinity.) The action of \u0393(Gl,P )\non (2.2.2) is induced by conjugation on the groups in (2.2.1). It is trivial on MP\nand free on MP\u2032 . As \u03c01 is a fibration by abelian varieties, in particular proper,\nthe \u0393(Gl,P )-orbits in AP are rather ugly, except in the case that AP = MP (i.e.,\nwhen WP is commutative). It is an essential observation that \u03c02 is a principal torus\nbundle with fiber\n(2.2.3)\n\nTP = \u0393(UP )\\UP (C).\n\nThrough (2.2.3), one uses torus embeddings to attach a substantial boundary to\nMP\u2032 for each P , in a fashion that is both equivariant for the action of \u0393(Gl,P ) and\n\n\f19\n\ncompatible with order relations and conjugacy among maximal parabolic subgroups\n[AMRT: p.117]. One then uses reduction theory to do the same for X = \u0393\\D, and\nthis produces the desired compactification of X [AMRT: III,\u00a7\u00a75,6].\nWe want to specify, and comment on, some of the details. The space X tor\ndepends on a collection \u03a3 of simplicial cone complexes (fans), \u03a3P \u2282 UP (R) (as P\nvaries), such that for \u03b3P = \u03b3P \u03b3 \u22121 (with \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393), \u03a3\u03b3P = \u03b3(\u03a3P )\u03b3 \u22121 ; also, whenever\nQ \u227a P , \u03a3Q contains \u03a3P as a closed boundary stratum (in a precise sense; see\nbelow), and \u0393(Gl,P ) acts separated and discontinuously on \u03a3P , compatibly with\nthe order relation. We always assume that \u03a3P is sufficiently fine so as to have full\nboundary, in the sense of [HZ1:2.2.6], to avert combinatorial anomalies.\nThe use of the term cone complex in the above means that a fan \u03a5 is subject to\nthe following two axioms:\nA1. If \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a5, and \u03c4 is a face of \u03c3, then \u03c4 \u2208 \u03a5.\nA2. If \u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 \u2208 \u03a5, and \u03c3 \u2229 \u03c3 \u2032 6= {0}, then \u03c3 \u2229 \u03c3 \u2032 is a face of both \u03c3 and \u03c3 \u2032 .\nAny fan \u03a5 in UP (R) determines in a standard way a torus embedding TP \u2282 TP,\u03a5 ,\non which TP acts (see [HZ1: 1.3] and references cited therein). Briefly, this goes as\nfollows; we present it for an arbitrary torus T . Each cone \u03c3 determines an affine\ntorus embedding T = T{0} \u2282 T\u03c3 (T -equivariant partial compactification), such that\nT\u03c4 \u2282 T\u03c3 whenever \u03c4 is a face of \u03c3. The axioms allow for gluing, viz., if \u03c4 = \u03c3 \u2229 \u03c3 \u2032 ,\nT{\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032 } = T\u03c3 \u222aT\u03c4 T\u03c3\u2032 .\n\n(2.2.4)\nOne takes T\u03a5 =\n\nS\n\n{T\u03c3 : \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a5}, with identifications as given by (2.2.4).\n\nThe notation in (2.2.4) contains the incidental statement that T{\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032 } is determined only by \u03c3 and \u03c3 \u2032 (and their intersection). Moreover, nothing new is obtained\nwhen \u03c3 \u2032 is a face of \u03c3; \u03c3 and the fan it generates (i.e., the one consisting of \u03c3 and all\nof its faces) produce the same torus embedding. Thus, axiom A1, which provides\nfor gluing, can be relaxed. We say that a collection of cones \u03a5 is a loose fan if it\nsatisfies the following weakened version of the axioms of a fan:\nA2\u2032 . If \u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 \u2208 \u03a5, then \u03c3 \u2229 \u03c3 \u2032 is in \u03a5 (so is a face of both \u03c3 and \u03c3 \u2032 ).\nA loose fan \u03a5 generates a fan \u03a5, given as the set of all elements of \u03a5 and their faces.\nIt also determines a torus embedding T\u03a5 , by the same procedure that is specified\nfor fans. It is clear that T\u03a5 = T\u03a5 .\nIt is convenient to remove the origin and contract out the cone dilations in a\nb likewise, we will take off our hats to\nfan, yielding from \u03a5 a simplicial complex \u03a5;\n\n\f20\n\nb to \u03a5 when \u03a5\nb is mentioned first. Moreover,\nget the fans, i.e., pass routinely from \u03a5\n\nwe standardize notation by using \u03c3, \u03c4 , etc. for simplicial cones, and \u03c3\nb, \u03c4b, etc. for\n\nsimplices. Each cone \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a5 corresponds to a T -orbit, which we denote T (\u03c3), with\n\ncodimC T (\u03c3) = dimR \u03c3, and then\n(2.2.4.1)\n\nT\u03c3 =\n\nG\n\n{T (\u03c4 ) : \u03c4 is a face of \u03c3};\n\nb is isomorphic to the\nhere we allow the improper face (\u03c4 = \u03c3).

All three are closed under the action of \u0393(Gl,P ) on \u03a3P . We\ngive the definition of the latter two: \u03a3cP is the fan spanned by the interior edges of\n\u03a3P , and \u03a3\u25e6P consists of those cones in \u03a3P that contain at least one edge from \u03a3cP .\nThus, \u03a3\u25e6P is usually not even a loose fan. In terms of simplices,\n[\nG\nb\u25e6 = \u03a3\nbP \u2212\nb Q : Q \u227b P }, so \u03a3\nbP =\nb \u25e6 : Q \u0017 P }.\n(2.2.9)\n\u03a3\n{\u03a3\n{\u03a3\nP\nQ\n\nbP\nb \u25e6 by describing them in the case where \u03a3\nb c and \u03a3\n(2.2.10) Remark. We illustrate \u03a3\nP\nP\n\nis replaced by the fan generated by a one-simplex, which consists of two vertices [0]\nand [1] spanning the simplex [0,1]. We declare that [1] is interior and [0] is boundary\nb P , then there would be Q \u227b P with [0] \u2208 \u03a3\nb Q ). Then:\n(if this were contained in \u03a3\nb c = {[1]},\n\u03a3\nP\n\nb \u25e6 = {[1], [0, 1]},\n\u03a3\nP\n\nand\n\nb P = {[0], [1], [0, 1]}.\n\u03a3\n\nThe boundary of X tor stratifies naturally in terms of \u03a3. We admit with some\napology that the notion of boundary stratum changed during the progression from\n[HZ1] to [HZ2]. Also, the term \"stratum\" is being used loosely, in that our strata\nneed not be smooth.\nThe Baily-Borel-type P -stratum in X tor , denoted <ZP (cf. [HZ1: 1.5]), is the\neP := Z(\u03a3\ne \u25e6 ); this in fact equals the closure of Z(\u03a3\ne c ) in\n\u0393(Gl,P )-quotient of <Z\nP\nP\ne\nZ(\u03a3P ). It follows directly from the construction that\ne P) =\nZ(\u03a3\n\nG\n\neQ : Q \u0017 P }\n{<Z\n\n\f22\n\neQ is produced in the\n(for such Q, \u03a3Q is a boundary component of \u03a3P ). In fact, <Z\nb Q (and TQ and M \u2032 ), and is partially compactified in\ntoroidal construction from \u03a3\nQ\nb\nb\nthe toroidal construction from \u03a3P \u2283 \u03a3Q . We let ZP denote the closure of <ZP\nin X tor , and refer to it as the closed P -stratum. The complement of <ZP in ZP\nb P a boundary\nis the (disjoint) union of all <ZQ \u2229 ZP with Q \u227a P -now with \u03a3\n\nb Q . Indeed, the combinatorial data for constructing ZP is contained\ncomponent of \u03a3\nb c in \u03a3\nb Q , as Q \u0016 P varies\nin the union of the open regular neighborhoods of \u03a3\nP\n\nb \u25e6 . Under\n(see [HZ2:(2.5.1, i)]); when Q = P , this neighborhood coincides with \u03a3\nP\n\nthe natural mapping \u03c0 : X tor \u2192 X \u2217 [AMRT: p.254], \u03c0 \u22121 (MP ) = <ZP , and then\nF\n\u2202X tor = P <ZP , with the union taken over \u0393-conjugacy classes.\nNext, let R be an arbitrary parabolic subgroup (possibly maximal) of G. We\n\u25e6\n\nwant to specify the (cubical) R-stratum Z R in X tor . One can write R uniquely as\nan intersection of maximal parabolic subgroups in a standard lattice:\n\\\n(2.2.11)\nR=\n{Q : Q \u2208 S},\nwhere\nS = SR = {Q maximal : Q \u2287 R} \u2194 {\u03b2 \u2208 \u2206 : \u03b2 = \u03b2Q for some maximal Q \u2287 R}.\n(Note that this usage of subsets of \u2206 is complementary to the usual one for indexing\nparabolic subgroups; a minimal parabolic subgroup corresponds to \u2206 here, not \u2205.)\nLet P be the smallest element in S. As in [HZ2: (2.2)], we then say that R is\nsubordinate to P , and write P = \u03a0(R). The R that are subordinate to a given P\nare in canonical one-to-one correspondence with the standard parabolic subgroups\nGl,R of Gl,P relative to \u2206l,P , including the improper one, by taking\n(2.2.12)\n\nGl,R = R \u2229 Gl,P ,\n\nso then\n\nR = Gl,R * Gh,P * WP .\n\nIf there were a good way to remove the \u0393-quotient from X tor to yield a space we\ne tor , the closed strata ZP of X tor would be induced from their inverse\nmight call X\n\neP in X\ne tor . The stratification would be cubical (or corner-like), in that the\nimages Z\neR } of X\ne tor would satisfy\nclosed strata {Z\n(2.2.13)\n\nZeR =\n\n\\\neQ : Q \u2208 S}\n{Z\n\n(compare (2.3.3) below), so the strata would be deducible from (2.2.13). However,\nthe preceding is an oversimplification.\nbP :\nHere is one way to proceed. Define for each R with \u03a0(R) = P a subset of \u03a3\n[\nb c := {b\nb P | \u03c4b has all vertices in\nb c and a vertex in each \u03a3\nb c }.\n(2.2.14) \u03a3\n\u03c4 \u2208\u03a3\n\u03a3\nR\nQ\nQ\nQ\u2208S\n\n\f23\n\nThis agrees with what we gave earlier when R is maximal. As R varies (subordinate\nb c 's are disjoint.\nto P ), the \u03a3\nR\n\n\u25e6\n\ne \u03a3\nb c ). The R-stratum of \u2202X tor is Z R \u2243 \u0393(Gl,R )\\\u017dR .\n(2.2.15) Definition. Let \u017dR = Z(\nR\n\nNote that replacing R by any \u0393-conjugate of R gives the same stratum; they are\n\u25e6\n\notherwise disjoint. We denote by ZR the closure of Z R in \u2202X tor (the closed Rstratum). Because ZR contains points from more than one standard lattice, it is\nsomewhat inconvenient to express it in terms of torus orbits.\nWe note that one has for the Baily-Borel-type P -stratum\nG \u25e6\n<\n(2.2.16.1)\nZP =\n{Z R\u2032 : \u03a0(R\u2032 ) = P }.\nThis suggests that one might also put, for general R,\nG \u25e6\n<\n(2.2.16.2)\nZR =\n{Z R\u2032 : R\u2032 \u2286 R, \u03a0(R\u2032 ) = P },\n\nbP .\nwhich gives the portion of ZR that is created in the toroidal construction from \u03a3\nT\n(2.2.17) Remark. ZR is generally only a connected component of {ZQ : Q \u2208 S}.\nBecause of the \u0393-quotient, this intersection usually has more than one connected\ncomponent, only one of which one wants to associate with R. The others correspond\nto certain G(Q)-conjugates of R (see [HZ2:(3.5, App.)]).\nIn [HZ2:(1.4, (d))], we introduced a canonical (topological) quotient of X tor ,\ncalled its real boundary quotient. Specifically, one collapses <ZP (2.2.16.1) of X tor\nto\n\n<\n\nZP /TPc , which inherits the fibrations (2.2.5.2) over AP and MP ; here, TPc\n\ndenotes the compact factor of TP , viz., \u0393(UP )\\UP (R). Because its construction is\nparallel to that of the excentric Borel-Serre compactification [HZ2:(1.4, (b))] (see\n(2.3) below), we rename it an excentric toroidal compactification of X, and denote\nit X tor,exc . We get a tower of compactifications (for each \u03a3):\n(2.2.18)\nLikewise, we write\n\u25e6\n\nviz. Z R /TPc ; define\n\nX tor \u2192 X tor,exc \u2192 X \u2217 .\n< exc\nZP for <ZP /TPc\nexc\n\u017dR\nanalogously as\n\n\u25e6\n\nand Z exc\nfor the R-stratum of X tor,exc ,\nR\n\u017dR /TPc . We can see that the topological\n\nstructure of \u017dRexc is rather simple. First, we make a basic observation:\nProposition 2.2.19 [HZ1: 2.1]. Let T \u2243 (C\u2217 )n be a torus, so that T /T c \u2243 (R+ )n .\nGiven any simplicial fan \u03a5 for T , let T\u03a5 denote the corresponding torus embedding.\nThen T\u03a5 /T c is a contractible n-dimensional manifold-with-corners.\nFrom this, we see immediately that\n\n\u0003\n\n\f24\nexc\nCorollary 2.2.20. The natural mapping \u017dR\n\u2192 AP is a homotopy equivalence.\n\n\u0003\n\n(2.3) The Borel-Serre compactification and its quotients. The spaces X\nand X\n\nred\n\nbelow are defined the same way in the absence of Hermitian structure.\n\nThe reader may assume again, for simplicity only, that G is simple over Q, for\nthe general group is almost a product of these. Let R be any parabolic subgroup\n(not necessarily maximal), and SR the maximal Q-split torus of the center of Rred .\nThen AR , the identity component of SR (R), acts geodesically on D [BS:\u00a73]. (In the\ncase where G = SL(2), D is the upper half-plane, and P is the group of uppertriangular matrices, AP is the the group of diagonal matrices, and the AP -orbits\nare the vertical lines.) When we write R as in (2.2.11), we have\n(2.3.1)\n\nAR =\n\nY\n\nAP .\n\nP \u2208S\n\nThe simple roots in S set up an isomorphism AR \u2243 (0, \u221e)S , which one uses to\ndefine AR as (0, \u221e]S , and then the corner D(R) = D \u00d7AR AR . The Borel-Serre\nboundary face associated to R is\ne(R) \u2243 D \u00d7AR {(\u221e, ..., \u221e)} \u2282 D(R);\nit decomposes (as a manifold) as\ne(R) \u2243 D/AR \u2243 e(R)red \u00d7 WR (R);\n\n(2.3.2)\n\nalso\n\nD \u2243 e(R) \u00d7 AR .\n\nHere e(R)red is the \"symmetric space\" (with Euclidean factors allowed) of LR /AR\n(cf. Dl,P in (2.2)). It is easy to see that D(R) contains e(Q) for all Q \u2283 R. Then\nwith a natural topology,\nD=\n\n[\n\n{D(R) : R is parabolic in G} = D \u2294\n\nG\n\n{e(R) : R is parabolic in G}\n\nis a manifold-with-corners with the e(R)'s as its open faces [BS:\u00a77]. The closure\ne(R) of e(R) in D adjoins to e(R) exactly those e(Q) with Q \u2286 R; indeed, the\nBorel-Serre construction actually applies to e(R), and then e(R) is its Borel-Serre\ncompactification. We have\n(2.3.3)\n\ne(R) =\n\n\\\n\n{e(P ) : P \u2208 S}.\n\nThere is an evident G(Q)-action on D, such that for g \u2208 G(Q), g * e(R) =\ne(gRg \u22121 ). Given any neat arithmetic subgroup \u0393 of G(Q), one puts X = \u0393\\D;\n\n\f25\n\nthis is the Borel-Serre compactification of X. It is a compact manifold-with-corners\nwith open faces of the form\ne\u2032 (R) \u2243 \u0393(R)\\e(R),\nand these are parametrized by \u0393-conjugacy classes of parabolic subgroups R of G.\nFrom (2.3.2), one sees that e\u2032 (R) is a fiber bundle over e\u2032 (R)red =: \u0393(R)\\e(R)red\nwith fiber \u0393(WR )\\WR (R), a compact nilmanifold. As was the case for the toroidal\nboundary in (2.2),\n\n\\\n\n{e\u2032 (P ) : P \u2208 S}\n\nhas the same finite number of connected components (arising for the same reason\nas (2.2.17)), one of which is e\u2032 (R).\nWe will be working with two natural quotients of X, X\n\nexc\n\nand X\n\nred\n\n, the excentric\n\nand reductive Borel-Serre compactifications of X resp. (The space X\n\nred\n\nplayed a\n\ncentral role in our previous article [Z4], where it was denoted M RBS .) They are\ndetermined by the respective quotients of the boundary strata:\n(2.3.4)\n\ne(R) \u2192 UP (R)\\e(R) =: e(R)exc \u2192 e(R)red ,\n\nwhen R is subordinate to the maximal parabolic P . As such, all three spaces have\nthe same number of boundary strata, indeed the same number as X tor . They fit\ninto a tower of compactifications:\nX\u2192X\n\n(2.3.5)\n\nexc\n\n\u2192X\n\nred\n\n\u2192 X \u2217.\n\nThat the Baily-Borel compactification X \u2217 is a quotient of X\n[Z3:(3.11)] and [GT:2.6.3]. The quotient mapping X\n\nred\n\nred\n\nis shown in\n\n\u2192 X \u2217 is given by the\n\nfollowing. Suppose that R is subordinate to the maximal parabolic P .

With notation as in Proposition 2.3.8, let \u03c0 exc : X\n\nexc\n\n\u2192 X\u2217\n\nbe the natural mapping. For x \u2208 MP \u2282 X \u2217 , (\u03c0 exc )\u22121 (x) is a \u0393(VP )-fibration over\nXl,P .\n\n\u0003\n\nIt is the central issue in this article that, except in easy cases (viz., when G is\nof Q-rank zero or R-rank one), the tower (2.3.5) is incompatible with the tower\n(2.2.18), in that there are no morphisms of compactifications of X, in either direction, between a Borel-Serre and a toroidal compactification of any sort (plain,\nexcentric, or reductive). It was shown by L. Ji that GCQ(X\nIn [GT], continuous mappings X tor \u2192 X\n\nred\n\nred\n\n, X tor) = X \u2217 [J].\n\nare constructed that are homotopy\n\nequivalent to a morphism of compactifications, and we will be elaborating on that\nin \u00a73.\nSuppose that a discrete group \u0398 acts continuously on a space Y . Recall that\nBorel defined a homotopy class of spaces h\u0398, Y i that is realized by \u0398\\Z for any\nfree \u0398-space Z mapping \u0398-equivariantly to Y . This is known as the Borel construction. It is at the heart of the notion of equivariant cohomology. From (2.3.9)\nand Corollary 2.2.20, we deduce:\n\u25e6\n\n\u2032\nexc\nProposition 2.3.11. The excentric boundary strata Z exc\nare homoR and e (R)\n\ntopy equivalent, both giving models for the Borel construction h\u0393(Gl,R ), AP i for the\naction of \u0393(Gl,R ) on AP .\n\n\u0003\n\n(2.3.12) Remark.

Such facts are suggestive of (3.5.11)\n\n\f27\n\nWe conclude with a curious assertion that holds in the non-Hermitian case as\nwell. Any Satake compactification X Sa of X (in the sense of [Z3]) is a quotient\nof X\n\nred\n\n[Z3:(3.11)]. An instance of this is X Sa = X \u2217 , as in (2.3.5). We have\n\nmorphisms of compactifications of X:\nX\u2192X\n\n(2.3.13)\n\nred\n\n\u2192 X Sa ,\n\nwhich is the \u0393-quotient of partial compactifications of D:\nD\u2192D\n\n(2.3.14)\n\nred\n\n\u2192 DSa .\n\nIf we assume that \u0393 is neat, we have that \u0393 acts freely on D. From [Z3], one sees\nthat the fibers of the mappings in (2.3.14) are contractible, so these mappings are\nhomotopy equivalences (indeed, as D is contractible, so are the other two spaces).\nWe need say no more (compare [HZ1:(3.9.1)]):\nProposition 2.3.15. Let D be a symmetric space of non-compact type, and \u0393 a\nneat arithmetically-defined group of isometries of D.

Ji [J] into the current context. When X is a locally symmetric variety, the\nspaces X tor and X are quite different in general, as we mentioned at the end of\n(2.3). Ji showed that their greatest common quotient is a topological space he\ncalled the intermediate compactification, which we will notate as X J , that differs\nfrom X \u2217 only in its highest-dimensional boundary stratum. An easier, but less\ndetailed version of that is the one intended in [HZ2: Conj. (1.5.8)]: the greatest\ncommon quotient of X tor and X\n\nred\n\nis X \u2217 .\n\nWe first present an auxiliary construction, namely the determination of certain\n\"group-theoretic\" compactifications between X\nD\n\nexc\n\nexc\n\nand X\n\nred\n\n. This gets decided on\n\n, so we consider the quotient mappings e(R)exc \u2192 e(R)red for all R. We seek\n\nto determine whether one gets a Hausdorff space by contracting the fibers for only\ncertain R; to give them a name, we call such spaces hybrid compactifications. Taking\nthe question back to D, we will use the criterion implicit in [Z1]:\ncR to be one of WR\n(2.A.1) Condition. For each R, let \u03a0(R) = P , and take W\ncgRg \u22121 =\nor UP .

We make systematic use of the language of \u00a71.\n(3.1) Main result and elements of the proof. Our present goal is to prove:\nTheorem 3.1.1. The canonical morphism LCM(X\n\nexc\n\n, X tor,exc ) \u2192 X tor,exc , hav-\n\ning contractible fibers, is a homotopy equivalence.\nWe will then see (Corollary 3.5.13, (ii)) that the corresponding assertion (GoreskyTai) for LCM(X\n\nred\n\n, X tor ) \u2192 X tor is deducible from Theorem 3.1.1 via LCM-\n\nbasechange (1.1.8).\nTo begin, we have from \u00a72 that the spaces X\n\nexc\n\nand X tor,exc are stratified, and\n\nhave X \u2217 as a (stratified) common quotient. By Proposition 1.1.5, the assertion of\nTheorem 3.1.1 can get decided locally over X \u2217 . In both cases, the fibers of the\nnatural mapping to X \u2217 over the stratum MP involve VP and the homogeneous\n\n\f29\n\ncone CP from (2.2), through the boundaries of partial compactifications of CP\u2032 :=\n\u0393(Gl,P )\\CP (see (3.5) below).\nLet \u010e(P ) denote the open subset UP (C)*D of the compact dual of D (cf.

Then \u03c3 \u2282 TR;\u03c3 \u2243 (R\u22650 )d is given by (0, 1]d (see\n(1.2)).\n\n\f30\n\nLet \u03a3 be a fan, as in (2.2). This determines a complex torus embedding T\u03a3\nby gluing the T\u03c3 's, and likewise a real torus embedding TR;\u03a3 . Give |\u03a3| the largest\ntopology for which the inclusion mappings of its cones are continuous. We then\ndefine two partial compactifications, \u03a31 and \u03a32 , by attaching to \u03a3 boundaries\nb \u00d7 (0, \u221e),\ninduced by the constructions in (1.2) on each simplex; with \u03a3 \u2243 \u03a3\n(3.2.2)\n\n\u03a31 =\n\n[\n\n{\u03c3 1 : \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3}\n\nand\n\n\u03a32 =\n\n[\n\n{\u03c3 2 : \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3},\n\nlikewise with the corresponding topology for the inclusions \u03c3 i \u0592\u2192 \u03a3i .

In the notation of (1.2), we have that for \u03c4 = \u03c4J \u2286 \u03c3, \u03c4 is given by the\nequations tj = 1 for all j \u2208 J, and \u03c4 \u2228 (b\n\u03c3 ) is given by the equations tj = 0 for\nall j \u2208\n/ J. This contracts to the point that has further equations tj = 1 for all\nj \u2208 J, viz., \u03c4b \u2229 \u03c4 \u2228 (b\n\u03c3 ). This point is independent of the top-dimensional cone \u03c3\n\n(cf.

Let {xj } be a sequence in \u03a3 that converges in both \u03a31\nb 1 lies in the interior \u03c4b\u25e6 of the simplex \u03c4b. We\nand \u03a32 . Suppose that the limit in \u03a3\nclaim that there is a top-dimensional cone \u03c3 containing \u03c4 (as a face) such that \u03c3\n\ncontains a subsequence of {xj } (because there can be infinitely many such \u03c3, there\nis something to check). If not, each such \u03c3 contains only finitely many xj 's. Thus,\nthere is a neighborhood N\u03c4 (\u03c3) of \u03c4 in \u03c3 that contains no xj 's. By the definition\nS\nof the topology, \u03c3 N\u03c4 (\u03c3) is open in \u03a3, and it contains no xj 's. This contradicts\n\nthe convergence. It follows that we may assume that the sequence is in a single\n\n\u03c3, and we are reduced to Proposition 1.2.1: the second limit lies in \u03c4 \u2228 (b\n\u03c3 ). Since\nb 1, \u03a3\nb 2)\nthis happens for every \u03c3 \u2283 \u03c4 , we use (3.2.4.1) and our formula for LCMb(\u03a3\n\nfollows. \u0003\n\nSuppose next that a discrete group \u0393l acts linearly on a cone complex \u03a3 in a\nseparated and discontinuous manner, such that there are only finitely many \u0393l equivalence classes of cones. We use \"prime\" to indicate a \u0393l -quotient, as in \u03a3\u2032 =\n\u0393l \\\u03a3, and do likewise in (3.2.2) to obtain\n(3.2.8)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03a31 = \u0393l \\\u03a31\n\nand\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03a32 = \u0393l \\\u03a32 .\n\nb be the correThe spaces in (3.2.8) are viewed as compactifications of \u03a3\u2032 . Let \u03a3\nb \u2032 = \u0393l \\\u03a3,\nb a compact\nsponding simplicial complex, as in (2.2). Then we have \u03a3\nb \u2032 having\nspace. From (3.2.3) and (3.2.6) we get a pair of polyhedral models of \u03a3\nfinitely many faces:\n(3.2.9)\n\nb \u2032 = \u0393l \\\u03a3\nb1\n\u03a3\n1\n\nand\n\nwith the latter given as in (1.2.4).\n\nb \u2032 = \u0393l \\\u03a3\nb 2,\n\u03a3\n2\n\nSince \u0393l acts on \u03a31 and \u03a32 , it acts of their LCM, i.e. the LCMb in Proposition\n3.2.6. The expected conclusion holds to a large extent:\nProposition 3.2.10. If \u0393l is neat, the actions of \u0393l on \u03a31 and \u03a32 are diagonal,\nand\n(3.2.10.1)\n\nb\u2032 , \u03a3\nb \u2032 ) = \u0393l \\\nLCMb(\u03a3\n1\n2\n\n[\n\nb\n{b\n\u03c4 \u00d7 \u03c4 \u2228 : \u03c4b \u2208 \u03a3}.\n\n\f32\n\nProof. By hypothesis, there is a subset S of \u03a3, the union of finitely many closed\ncones, such that the mapping S \u2192 \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3\u2032 is surjective. This gives the same for\nthe respective closures of S in \u03a31 and \u03a32 :\nS 1 \u2192 \u03a31\n\nand\n\nS 2 \u2192 \u03a32 .\n\nMoreover, S 1 and S 2 are compact. Thus, we are in the setting of Proposition 1.3.8,\nprovided we verify that the actions of \u0393l on \u03a31 and \u03a32 are diagonal.\nb 1 = \u2202\u03a31 , e1 \u2208 \u03c4b and e2 \u2208 (\u03c4 \u2228 )\u25e6 . As \u03c4b varies, this gives all points (e1 , e2 )\nLet \u03c4b \u2208 \u03a3\n\nb 1, \u03a3\nb 2 ), by (3.2.7.3). Suppose that (\u03b3 * e1 , e2 ) \u2208 LCMb(\u03a3\nb 1, \u03a3\nb 2 ) for some\nof LCMb(\u03a3\n\n1 6= \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393l . A priori, there are two cases. If \u03b3 * \u03c4b = \u03c4b, then \u03b3 acts as a permutation\n\nof the vertices of \u03c4b, so it fixes the barycenter of \u03c4b. Since \u0393l us assumed neat, \u03b3\n\nmust fix the whole boundary component containing \u03c4 \u25e6 , hence also its closure. In\n\nparticular, \u03b3 * e1 = e1 . On the other hand, suppose that \u03b3 * \u03c4b 6= \u03c4b. The only way\n\nthat both (e1 , e2 ) and (\u03b3 * e1 , e2 ) could be in the LCMb is if e2 \u2208 \u03c4 \u2228 \u2229 (\u03b3 * \u03c4 )\u2228 .\nHowever, this set would lie in the boundary of \u03c4 \u2228 , a contradiction. The conclusion\nis, then, that \u03b3 * e1 = e1 , so the actions are diagonal.\nThis gives that the canonical mapping\nb 1, \u03a3\nb 2 ) \u2192 LCMb(\u03a3\nb \u20321 , \u03a3\nb \u20322 )\n\u0393l \\LCMb(\u03a3\n\nis an isomorphism. We use Proposition 3.2.6 to obtain formula (3.2.10.1). \u0003\n(3.2.10.2) Remarks. i) One might try to prove Proposition 3.2.10 by using (3.2.7.1)\ninstead of (3.2.7.3). The reader is invited to investigate why we took the other\nroute.\nii) If \u03c4b above is just the vertex {e1 }, the situation is very much like that in\n\n(1.3.6), but here we keep \u0393l fixed.\n\n(3.3) Adjustments to duality. For a pair of reasons, LCM(X\n\nexc\n\n, X tor,exc )\n\ncannot be determined from Proposition 3.2.10 alone. First, the projection (from\nb\u2032 of the P -stratum of X tor,exc is not dense in \u03a3\nb \u2032 ; it is\nProposition 3.1.2) onto C\n2\nP\n\nonly the (compact) \u0393(Gl,P )-quotient of the subcomplex\n[\nb c )\u2228 =\nb c },\n(3.3.1)\n(\u03a3\n{\u03c4 \u2228 : \u03c4b \u2208 \u03a3\nP\nP\n\nb 2 . Then (\u03a3\nb c )\u2228 can be identified, via (1.2.4),\nwhich is contained in the interior of \u03a3\nP\n(1)\n(1)\nb\nwith \u03a3P . Here, the barycentric subdivision \u03a3P of \u03a3P also gives a compatible\n\ncollection of fans as P varies.

One gets something essentially the same by using the \"Gl,P side\"\nof the description in [Z2: 3.18].\nWe take a brief excursion into the calculus of joins. Let \u03c9\nb be the face of a simplex\n\n\u03c3\nb that is opposite the face \u03c4b of \u03c3\nb, i.e., \u03c9\nb is spanned by the vertices of \u03c3\nb that are\n\nnot in \u03c4b. Then \u03c3\nb is the join \u03c9\nb \u2217 \u03c4b, namely the quotient of \u03c9\nb \u00d7 [0, 1] \u00d7 \u03c4b obtained by\n\nseparately collapsing \u03c9\nb \u00d7 {1} to a point and {0} \u00d7 \u03c4b to a point. The face \u03c9\nb of \u03c3\nb lies\nat s = 0 and \u03c4b is at s = 1, where s denotes the variable of [0,1]. One can collapse\n\n\u03c3\nb\u2212\u03c9\nb , and also its subset \u03c4 \u2228 (\u03c3), onto \u03c4b by the following deformation retraction:\n\n{hs } is given by mappings on the product \u03c9\nb \u00d7 (0, 1] \u00d7 \u03c4b that depend only on the\n\ninterval variable: fs (t) = min{t + s, 1}; hs (w, t, x) = (w, fs (t), x). Note that \u03c4 \u2228 (\u03c3)\nis closed under the flow.\nThe setting above is for disjoint faces of one simplex in a complex. However, the\nnotion can easily be extended to intersecting faces. Let \u03c4b and \u03c9\nb be simplices with\nintersection \u03b1\nb. Write \u03c4b = \u03b1\nb\u2217b\n\u03c4 \u2032 and \u03c9\nb=\u03b1\nb\u2217b\n\u03c9 \u2032 .

We are interested in the dual, in the\n\nsense of (3.2.4.1), of a join.\n\nProposition 3.3.4. i) Let \u03c4b and \u03c9\nb be faces of a top-dimensional simplex \u03c3\nb in a\nb Then\nsimplicial complex \u03a3.\n\n(3.3.4.1)\n\n(b\n\u03c4 \u2217\u03c9\nb )\u2228 (b\n\u03c3 ) = \u03c4 \u2228 (b\n\u03c3 ) \u2229 \u03c9 \u2228 (b\n\u03c3 ).\n\nb such that \u03c4 \u2228 \u2229 \u03c9 \u2228 6= \u2205, then \u03c4b \u2217 \u03c9\nii) Conversely, if \u03c4b and \u03c9\nb are simplices in \u03a3\nb\n\nis defined and\n(3.3.4.2)\n\n(b\n\u03c4 \u2217\u03c9\nb )\u2228 = \u03c4 \u2228 \u2229 \u03c9 \u2228 .\n\nProof. We use the notation from the proof of Proposition 1.2.1. If we write \u03c4b = \u03c4bJ\n\nand \u03c9\nb = \u03c4bK , then \u03c4b \u2217 \u03c9\nb = \u03c4b(J\u2229K) . Similarly, we have \u03c4 \u2228 = \u03c4J\u2228 , with defining\n\n\u2228\nequations parametrized by the complement of J, and likewise for K, so \u03c4J\u2228 \u2229 \u03c4K\n=\n\u2228\n\u03c4(J\u2229K)\n. This gives i).\n\n\f34\n\nAs for ii), because more than one top-dimensional simplex is involved in the\ndual, we must be a little careful.

Then\n\u03c4 \u2228 (b\n\u03c3 ) \u2229 \u03c9 \u2228 (b\n\u03c3 \u2032 ) = (\u03c4 \u2228 \u2229 \u03c9 \u2228 )(b\n\u03c3\u2229\u03c3\nb\u2032 ).

The torus TPc acts trivially on both \u2202P X\n\nexc\n\nand \u2202P X\n\nred\n\n, and \u2202P X tor,exc is the TPc -quotient of \u2202P X tor .\n\nThe argument proving (3.5.12.1) follows the one in the proof of Proposition 1.1.14\nverbatim. \u0003\nFrom this, we obtain the following:\nCorollary 3.5.13. i) The canonical mapping LCM(X\n\nexc\n\n, X tor ) \u2192 X tor has con-\n\ntractible fibers.\nii) [GT] The canonical mapping LCM(X\n\nred\n\n, X tor ) \u2192 X tor has contractible fibers.\n\nProof. From the definition (1.1.8), the LCM-basechange given by Proposition 3.5.12\nimplies that LCM(Y, X tor) \u2192 X tor and LCM(Y, X tor,exc) \u2192 X tor,exc have the same\nfiber when either Y = X\n3.5.7, so we are done.\n\nred\n\nor Y = X\n\nexc\n\n. These fibers are contractible by Corollary\n\n\u0003\n\n4. Canonical extension of homogeneous vector bundles.\nIn this section, we perform the toroidal construction of [AMRT] (see our (2.2))\non a homogeneous vector bundle E\u0393 on X = \u0393\\D (we drop henceforth the subscript\n\"\u0393\"). This yields a holomorphic vector bundle E tor on X tor . We show (4.4.5) that\nE tor is the canonical extension of E to X tor in the sense of [Mu] (see [HZ1: 3.2])\nwhen E is holomorphic. It is then an easy matter to descend E tor to a complex\nvector bundle E tor,exc on X tor,exc . The treatment is similar in tone to the BorelSerre construction for the canonical extension E\n\nred\n\nof E to X\n\nred\n\ngiven in [Z4: 1.10];\n\nthe latter also gives immediately the canonical extension bundle E\n\nexc\n\non X\n\nexc\n\n.\n\n(4.1) Standard notions. Let D = G/K as before. Let E be a finite-dimensional\ncomplex vector space, and \u03c1 : K \u2192 GL(E) a representation of K. The action of K\non E extends to one of its complexification K(C), and thereby to the (correct choice\nof) C-parabolic subgroup P having K(C) as Levi quotient. The so-called compact\ndual of D is given as \u010e = G(C)/P, and it contains D as an open subset. The\nG-homogeneous vector bundle Ee = G \u00d7K E on D descends to E on X by taking the\nquotient by \u0393 on the left. It also extends to the G(C)-homogeneous vector bundle\n\n\u011a = G(C) \u00d7P E on \u010e, with the bundle projection given by\n(4.1.1)\n\n\u011a = G(C) \u00d7P E \u2192 G(C) \u00d7P {0} = \u010e.\n\n\f48\n\n(4.1.2) Remark. Taking E = {0} gives Ee = D and \u011a = \u010e. Thus the constructions\n\nof [AMRT] will become a special case of ours. For this reason, we shall cease to\ntalk about D and \u010e unless that is needed to clarify the discussion for the general\n\nhomogeneous vector bundle.\nLet P be a maximal parabolic subgroup of G. This determines the open subset\n\u010e(P ) = UP (C) * D of \u010e (cf. (3.1.2.2)). It is convenient to allow the improper\nparabolic G here, and then P \u227a G for all maximal parabolic P and \u010e(G) = D.\nOne sees that \u010e(P ) \u2282 \u010e(Q) whenever Q \u227a P , as UQ \u2283 UP . We point out that the\ncomplement of \u010e(P ) in \u010e(Q) has non-empty interior.\nMoving K by the inverse Cayley transform for P (see [HZ1: 1.8]) determines a\nbasepoint for \u010e(P ) that is left fixed by Gl,P . One sees that \u010e(P ) is homogeneous\nunder the group P \u2032 = Gh,P *WP *UP (C). As P \u2032 \u2229K = Kh,P , where Kh,P = K \u2229Gh,P ,\none obtains the decomposition\n(4.1.3)\n\n\u010e(P ) \u2243 DP \u00d7 VP \u00d7 UP (C)\n\n(see (3.1.2.2); also (2.2.2)). The action of Gl,P on \u010e(P ) is induced by its adjoint\naction on P . It preserves the factors in (4.1.3); in particular, itsufficiently small) is\ntrivial on the factor DP . This yields a projection of D \u2282 \u010e(P ) onto DP .\nLet \u011a(P ) denote the restriction of \u011a to \u010e(P ). We can write the bundle projection, the restriction of (4.1.1), as\n(4.1.4)\n\n\u011a(P ) = P \u2032 \u00d7Kh,P E \u2192 P \u2032 \u00d7Kh,P {0} = \u010e(P ),\n\nwith P \u2032 acting on the left. We have \u011a(P ) \u2282 \u011a(Q) whenever Q \u227a P .\n(4.2) Torus actions and torus embeddings, revisited. We form the quotient \u011aP\u2032 = \u0393(P \u2032 )\\\u011a(P ). On P \u2032 \u00d7 E, the actions of Kh,P (as for (4.1.4)) and the\nC-torus TP = \u0393(UP )\\UP (C) (trivial on E) commute, as UP is the center of P \u2032 .\nTherefore, TP acts on \u011a(P )\u2032 .

For a topological vector bundle\nV, let C(V) denote the sheaf of continuous sections of V; if V is holomorphic, we\ndenote by O(V) the sheaf of holomorphic sections. We begin by stating some basic\nfacts about the unextended bundles:\n\n\f50\n\nLemma 4.3.1. i) The Gl,P -equivariant mapping \u011aP\u2032 \u2192 MP\u2032 in (4.2.1) induces the\nmapping \u011aPA \u2192 AP (by TP -quotient), which is a vector bundle projection.\nii) \u011aP\u2032 \u2243 \u03c02\u2217 \u011aPA = MP\u2032 \u00d7AP \u011aPA .\niii) In terms of ii), the TP -action on \u011aP\u2032 is given by the TP -action on MP\u2032 and\nthe trivial action on \u011aPA . In particular, [(\u03c02 )\u2217 C(\u011aP\u2032 )]TP = C(\u011aPA ).\nProof. Statements i) and ii) are immediate from (4.2.1.1).

Suppose that Q \u227a P , so \u011a(P ) \u2282 \u011a(Q)\n\n\f51\n\n(the complement has non-empty interior, for the same holds in \u010e(Q)). One can\ndecompose TQ as the product of TP and a complementary torus-call it TP,Q .\nAssuming that \u03a3P \u2286 UP \u2229 \u03a3Q , we get that\n(4.3.4) \u011a(Q)\u2032\u03a3P = \u011a(Q)\u2032 \u00d7TQ TQ,\u03a3P = \u011a(Q)\u2032 \u00d7TQ (TP,Q \u00d7TP,\u03a3P ) \u2243 \u011a(Q)\u2032 \u00d7TP TP,\u03a3P .\nFrom this, we see that \u011a(Q)\u2032\u03a3P contains the \u0393(TP,Q )-quotient of \u011a(P )\u2032\u03a3P as an\n\u2032\n\u2032\nopen set.

We present next the construction of E tor (when E = 0, it reduces to the\nmain theorem of [AMRT, III,\u00a7\u00a75,6], treated in our (2.2)).\nOnly to put the construction of the vector bundle in \"usual\" patching format,\nwe choose, for each P (allowing, for convenience, SG = D), a realm of reduction\nSP \u2282 D for P . By this, we mean that SP is a sufficiently large \u0393(P )-invariant\nopen set on which \u0393-equivalence reduces to \u0393(P )-equivalence. If we select SP\nin a manner that is compatible with the action of \u0393 by conjugation on the set\nof parabolic subgroups, we need make only finitely many arbitrary choices. For\ninstance, we can take SP to be the inverse image in D of a suitable deleted collar\nof the closed Borel-Serre face e\u2032 (P ) \u2282 X.

We have, from Lemma 4.3.1 i) by restriction, that each BP,\u03a3\nis a vector\nP\n\u2032\nbundle over SP,\u03a3\n. The restrictions of Proposition 4.3.2 and 4.3.5 imply that they\nP\n\npatch to define a vector bundle over X tor . \u0003\nSince the characterization of canonical extension can be given in terms of the\n\u2032\nhomogeneous bundle on the sets MP,\u03a3\n(for all P ) [HZ1: 3.2], we obtain immediately\nP\n\nfrom Proposition 4.3.3:\n\n\f52\n\nProposition 4.3.8.

We need to check that we can make choices so that\nthe diagram commutes, for then qkq = h and\nh\u2217 E\n\nred\n\n= q\u2217 k\u2217 q\u2217 E\n\nred\n\n= q\u2217 k\u2217 E\n\nexc\n\n= q \u2217 E tor,exc = E tor .\n\nFor that, we can take homotopy inverses for both marked arrows in the first row.\nThis implies (by LCM-basechange) the same for the second row, such that\nred\n\nexc\n\nX tor,exc \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 LCM(X , X tor,exc ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 LCM(X , X tor,exc )\nx\nx\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nX tor\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nLCM(X\n\nred\n\n, X tor)\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nLCM(X\n\ncommutes. This is almost what we need. However, LCM(X\n\nexc\n\nexc\n\n, X tor )\n\n, X tor ) is not involved\n\nin the construction from [GT], so we must check that invoking it is harmless.

Let \u03b7 be a homotopy inverse of the projection p. Then\nq\u03b1\u03b7 = \u03b2p\u03b7 = \u03b2, as desired.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe natural setting for Conjecture A is really the excentric compactifications.\nIndeed, our investigation of these in [HZ2:\u00a71] was guided by the feeling that the\ntwo had much in common, yet they were not isomorphic as compactifications of X.\nWe emphasize this by formulating the excentric version of Conjecture A:\n\n\f54\n\nConjecture A\u2032 . Let k : X tor,exc \u2192 X\n\nexc\n\nbe any of the continuous mappings con-\n\nstructed as above. Then the canonical extension E tor,exc is isomorphic to the pullback k \u2217 E\n\nexc\n\n.\n\n(4.5) Proof of the excentric Goresky-Tai conjecture. We abstract the\nset-up just a little. Let Y1 and Y2 be two compactifications of X, with projections\np1 : LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) \u2192 Y1 and p2 : LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) \u2192 Y2 . Suppose that p2 is a homotopy\nequivalence, with homotopy inverse i : Y2 \u2192 LCM(Y1 , Y2 ). When X is a locally\nsymmetric variety, we will be taking Y1 = X\n\nexc\n\nand Y2 = X tor,exc .\n\nSuppose that for a vector bundle E on X, E has extensions E1 \u2192 Y1 and\nE2 \u2192 Y2 . We assert:\nLemma 4.5.1. In the above setting, put k = p1 \u25e6 i. Then the following are equivalent:\ni) k \u2217 E1 \u2243 E2 ,\nii) p\u22171 E1 \u2243 p\u22172 E2 (as vector bundles on LCM(Y1 , Y2 )).\nProof. Write i) out as i\u2217 p\u22171 E1 \u2243 E2 , and apply p\u22172 to both sides. As i \u25e6 p2 is\nhomotopic to the identity, we have p\u22172 i\u2217 is the identity on isomorphism classes of\nvector bundles, giving ii). The other direction is similar: apply i\u2217 to ii). \u0003\nThus, we seek a method for verifying (4.5.1, ii) in the situation of interest, where\nwe have E1 = E\n\nexc\n\nand E2 = E tor,exc . We continue, though, in the abstract setting.\n\nProposition 4.5.2. Let Y1 , Y2 \u2208 PCp(X), E \u2192 X a vector bundle, and E1 \u2192\nY1 , E2 \u2192 Y2 vector bundle extensions of E. Concerning the diagram\np\ne1\n\np\ne2\n\np1\n\np2\n\nE1 \u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 LCM(E1 , E2 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03c6\n\u03c61 y\ny\n\nE2\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03c62\ny\n\nY1 \u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Y2 ,\n\nthe following are equivalent:\ni) \u03c6 is a vector bundle projection;\nii) LCM(E1 , E2 ) \u2243 p\u22171 E1 \u2243 p\u22172 E2 .\nProof. We show that i) implies ii), the other direction being obvious. By the\nuniversal property of a pullback, there is a canonical morphism LCM(E1 , E2 ) \u2192\np\u22171 E1 over LCM(Y1 , Y2 ). By assumption, it is a morphism of total spaces of vector\n\n\f55\n\nbundles of the same rank (that of E). To see it is an isomorphism, we may compute\nlocally on Y1 \u00d7 Y2 and thereby assume that E1 and E2 are trivial. Thus, we write\nE1 \u2243 Y1 \u00d7 V and E2 \u2243 Y2 \u00d7 V \u2032 , where V = V \u2032 is a vector space. Then:\nE1 \u00d7 E2 = (Y1 \u00d7 V ) \u00d7 (Y2 \u00d7 V \u2032 ) \u2243 (Y1 \u00d7 Y2 ) \u00d7 (V \u00d7 V \u2032 ),\nLCM(E1 \u00d7 E2 ) \u2282 LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) \u00d7 (V \u00d7 V \u2032 ),\np\u22171 E1 = LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) \u00d7 (V \u00d7 {0}).\nThe morphism LCM(E1 , E2 ) \u2192 p\u22171 E1 is, in these terms, induced by the projection\nLCM(Y1 , Y2 ) \u00d7 (V \u00d7 V \u2032 ) \u2192 LCM(Y1 , Y2 ) \u00d7 (V \u00d7 {0}). We have a priori that this\ncontains as E \u2192 X as a subset, thus isomorphisms \u03b9x : V \u2192 V \u2032 for x \u2208 X. Our\nhypothesis implies the extension of {\u03b9x }, at least as mappings, to all of LCM(Y1 , Y2 ).\nMaking the same argument for p\u22172 E2 , we see that the extension of \u03b9x is invertible\nand ii) holds.\n\n\u0003\n\n(4.5.2.1) Remark. It is instructive to consider the case Y1 = Y2 with E1 and E2\nnon-isomorphic.\nWith the criterion given by Proposition 4.5.2, it remains to verify:\nProposition 4.5.3. The mapping LCM(E\n\nexc\n\n, E tor,exc ) \u2192 LCM(X\n\nexc\n\n, X tor,exc ) is\n\na vector bundle projection.\nProof. We must look simultaneously at the Borel-Serre and toroidal parametrizations of E, relative to DP . (In particular, we do not have to deal with the Kh equivariance.) There is a Kl -equivariant mapping\n(4.5.3.1)\n\n\u03a8P : Gl,P \u00d7 AP \u00d7 UP \u00d7 VP \u00d7 E \u2192 UPim \u00d7 UP \u00d7 VP \u00d7 E,\n\ngiven by \u03a8P (g, u, v, e) = (gu\u20320 g \u22121 , u, v, e), where u\u20320 is an element of CP fixed by Kl .\nThis ultimately induces the pair of spaces: a (TPc \u00d7 E)-fibration over an arithmetic\nquotient of (C P \u00d7 VP ), and a (TP,\u03a3P )exc \u00d7 E-fibration over an arithmetic quotient\nof VP . The LCM in the case of E = {0} (for X\n\nexc\n\nand X tor,exc ) is covered by\n\nProposition 3.5.6. Since (4.5.3.1) is a product with the identity mapping of E, we\nsee that the action of \u0393(Gl,P * VP ) is diagonal for general E, and LCM(E\nan E-fibration over LCM(X\n\nexc\n\n, X tor,exc ), as we wanted to show.\n\nexc\n\n, E tor,exc )\n\n\u0003\n\nBy Theorem 4.4.1, the conjecture of Goresky and Tai (Conjecture A) is likewise\nproved.\n\n\f56\nReferences\n[AMRT] Ash, A., Mumford, D., Rapoport, M., Tai, Y.-S., Smooth Compactification of Locally\nSymmetric Varieties, Math.
