A two-component blackbody+power-law (BB+PL) fit of the pulsar's spectrum\nyields the photon index \u0393psr = 1.2 \u00b1 0.6 and luminosity Lpsr = (4 \u00b1 1) \u00d7 1031 ergs s\u22121 of the PL component,\nin the 0.5\u20138 keV band, for a plausible distance d = 3.5 kpc and nH = 0.7 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 . The BB component\ncorresponds to the temperature T \u2248 2 MK, and bolometric luminosity Lbol \u223c 1 \u00d7 1032 ergs s\u22121 . The bright\ninner PWN component of a 3\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 12\u2032\u2032 size is elongated in the north-south direction, with the pulsar close to its\nsouth end. This component is immersed in a larger (\u2248 20\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 40\u2032\u2032 ), similarly elongated outer PWN component\nof lower surface brightness. The elongated shape of the compact PWN can be explained by the ram pressure\nconfinement of the pulsar wind due to the supersonic motion of the pulsar. The observed flux of the compact\nPWN, including both components, is Fpwn \u2243 (1.5 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10\u221213 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 1\u20136 keV band.

The compact PWN appears to be inside\na more extended (\u2248 4\u2032 \u00d7 4\u2032 ) emission with the total observed flux Fext \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u221213 ergs s\u22121 in the 0.8\u20137 keV\nband. This large-scale emission is more extended to the south of the pulsar, i.e. in the direction of the alleged\npulsar motion. To explain the extended X-ray emission ahead of the moving pulsar, one has to invoke strong\nintrinsic anisotropy of the pulsar wind or assume that this emission comes from a relic PWN swept by the\nasymmetrical reverse SNR shock. The pulsar and its PWN are located within the extent of the unidentified TeV\nsource HESS J1809\u2013193. The brightest part of the TeV source is offset by \u223c 8\u2032 to the south of the pulsar, i.e. in\nthe same direction as the large-scale X-ray emission. Although the association between the PSR J1809\u20131917\nand HESS J1809\u2013193 is plausible, an alternative source of relativistic electrons powering HESS J1809\u2013193\nmight be the serendipitously discovered X-ray source CXOU J180940.7\u2212192544. In addition to the CMBR\nor Galactic starlight background, the low-frequency seed photons for Compton upscattering to TeV energies\nmight be supplied by bright infrared emission from dust-molecular clouds seen within HESS J1809\u2013193.\nSubject headings: pulsars: individual (PSR J1809\u20131917) - X-rays: individual (CXOU J180940.7\u2212192544,\nCXOU 180933.3\u2212192959) - gamma-rays: individual (HESS J1809\u2013193) - ISM: individual (IRAS 18067\u20131927, IRAS 18067\u20131921)\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nChandra and XMM-Newton observations have established\nthe ubiquity of X-ray pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) around\nyoung rotation-powered pulsars (see the reviews by Kaspi et\nal. 2006 and Gaensler & Slane 2006). The X-ray PWN emission is produced by relativistic particles gyrating in the magnetic field downstream of the termination shock in the pulsar\nwind (Kennel & Coroniti 1994; Arons 2004). Most of the\nPWNe have been discovered around young (\u03c4 . 30 kyr) pulsars. The innermost parts of the young PWNe often show\naxisymmetric morphologies, including toroidal structures and\njets along the pulsar's spin axis. Recently, it has become apparent that PWNe accompanying older pulsars can also be\nquite luminous (e.g., McGowan et al. 2006). Many of these\nolder PWNe exhibit cometary morphologies indicating that\nthe pulsar wind is confined by the ram pressure caused by\nthe supersonic motion of the pulsar in the ambient medium.\nStudying X-ray PWNe of various ages helps understand the\nnature and evolution of the ultrarelativistic pulsar winds and\ntheir interaction with the ambient medium.\nAn interesting object for such investigations is PSR J809\u2013\nElectronic address: oyk100@psu.edu,pavlov@astro.psu.edu\n\n1917 (hereafter J1809). The discovery of this radio pulsar\n(P = 82.7 ms) in the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey1 was\nreported by Morris et al. (2002). The pulsar's dispersion measure, DM = 197 cm\u22123 pc, and the Galactic electron distribution models by Taylor & Cordes (1993) and Cordes & Lazio\n(2002) give the distance to the pulsar of 3.7 and 3.5 kpc, respectively. Having the spin-down age \u03c4 \u2261 P/2\u1e56 = 51 kyr and\nspin-down power \u0116 \u2261 4\u03c0 2 I \u1e56P\u22123 \u2243 1.8 \u00d7 1036 ergs s\u22121 , J1809\nis somewhat older and less energetic than the famous Vela pulsar (\u03c4 = 11 kyr, \u0116 = 6.9 \u00d7 1036 ergs s\u22121 ), which is accompanied\nby a remarkable PWN resolved in radio (Dodson et al. 2003b)\nand X-rays (Pavlov et al. 2003, and references therein). However, it is much more energetic than typical \"middle-aged\"\npulsars, such as B0656+14 (\u03c4 = 110 kyr, \u0116 = 3.8 \u00d7 1034 ergs\ns\u22121 ) and Geminga (\u03c4 = 340 kyr, \u0116 = 3.2\u00d71034 ergs s\u22121 ), whose\nPWNe are very faint (e.g., Pavlov et al. 2006).\nJ1809 is young enough to look for a remnant of the supernova that created the pulsar. Deep radio observations by Brogan et al. (2004) have revealed two compact HII regions and\ntwo SNRs, G11.03\u22120.05 and G11.18+0.11, projected near\nthe pulsar (the pulsar's Galactic coordinates are l = 11.094\u25e6,\n1\n\nhttp://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/pmsurv\n\n\f2\nb = +0.080\u25e6). The distances to the SNRs, estimated from\nthe radio surface brightness-diameter (\u03a3 \u2212 D) relation (Case\n& Bhattacharya 1998), are \u223c 16 and \u223c 17 kpc, respectively.\nHowever, given the very large uncertainty of the \u03a3 \u2212 D relation for faint SNRs, the association of J1809 with one of the\nSNRs cannot be ruled out despite the discrepant distance estimates. Brogan et al. (2004) estimated that the pulsar would\nneed to have the transverse speed of about 200 or 140 km s\u22121\nto originate from the geometrical center of G11.03\u22120.05 or\nG11.18+0.11, respectively, assuming that all three are at the\nsame distance of 4 kpc and the pulsar's true age is 50 kyrs.\nThe estimated speeds are close to the average speeds recently\nmeasured for a large sample of radio pulsars by Hobbs et al.\n(2005).\nBefore the detailed radio studies were carried out, the region had been observed by ASCA, first as part of the Galactic plane survey (Sugizaki et al. 2001), and then with a\ndeeper follow-up exposure (Bamba et al. 2003; Ueno et al.\n2005). These observations revealed an amorphous diffuse\nemission that encompassed the pulsar position. No pulsar\nhas been detected in these X-ray observations. The observed\nlarge-scale emission was attributed to a new SNR, dubbed\nG11.0+0.0. Bamba et al. (2003) have found that the X-ray\nspectrum of the putative SNR fits the absorbed power-law\n(PL) model with photon index \u0393 = 1.6+0.3\n\u22120.2 , hydrogen column\ndensity nH,22 \u2261 nH /(1022 cm\u22122 ) = 0.8 \u00b1 0.3, and 0.7\u201310 keV\nflux of 3.8 \u00d7 10\u221212 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 . Using the best-fit nH and\nassuming that the mean density in the Galactic plane is 1 H\ncm\u22123 , Bamba et al. (2003) estimated the distance of 2.6 kpc,\nwhich gives the X-ray luminosity of \u2248 3.7 \u00d7 1033 ergs s\u22121 (in\n0.7\u201310 keV). These authors suggested that G11.0+0.0 could\nbe a Crab-like (plerionic) SNR.\nStudying of the J1809 field has become particularly interesting after the recent discovery of the TeV \u03b3-ray source\nHESS J1809\u2013193 (hereafter HESS J1809; Aharonian et al.\n2007). The brightest, firmly detected part of this extended\nsource (radius \u223c 12\u2032 \u201315\u2032 ) is centered at R.A.= 18h 09.8m ,\ndecl.= \u221219\u25e625\u2032 , about 8\u2032 from J1809; its \u03b3-ray flux is F\u03b3 \u2248\n1.4 \u00d7 10\u221212 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 1\u201310 TeV band. Given the\nsmall angular separation, it seems plausible that the HESS\nsource could be powered by this pulsar, in which case its \u03b32\nray luminosity, L\u03b3 \u2248 2 \u00d7 1034 d3.5\nergs s\u22121 , would be about 1%\nof the pulsar's spindown power.\nIn this paper, we describe the results of a Chandra observation of PSR J1809\u20131917 and its compact synchrotron nebula2 and discuss its possible connection to HESS J1809. We\nalso describe the multiwavelength properties of objects located within the central part of HESS J1809, including two\nnewly discovered X-ray sources, and discuss their relation to\nHESS J1809. The details of the observation and the data analysis are presented in \u00a72. In \u00a73 we discuss possible interpretations of the PWN morphology, describe inferences from the\npulsar spectrum, and speculate on the nature of HESS J1809\nand its relation to the other sources in the field. Our main\nresults are summarized in \u00a74.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS\n\nJ1809 was observed with the Advanced CCD Imaging\nSpectrometer (ACIS) on board Chandra on 2004 July 21 (ObsID 3853). The useful scientific exposure time was 19,955 s.\nThe observation was carried out in Faint mode, and the pul2 Preliminary results of this observation have been presented by Sanwal et\nal. (2005).\n\nsar was imaged on S3 chip, \u2248 0.72\u2032 off-axis. The other ACIS\nchips activated during this observation were S1, S2, S4, I2,\nand I3. The detector was operated in Full Frame mode, which\nprovides time resolution of 3.24 seconds. The data were reduced using the Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations\n(CIAO) software (ver. 3.2.1; CALDB ver. 3.0.3).\n2.1. Images\nFigure 1 shows the ACIS-S3 image of the region around\nJ1809. An extended X-ray source is clearly seen in the image\naround R.A.= 18h 09m 43.123s, decl.= \u221219\u25e6 17\u2032 38.17\u2032\u2032 (these\nare the coordinates of the center of the brightest pixel). The\ndifference of 0.5\u2032\u2032 between this position and the radio position\nfrom Morris et al. (2006) is within the uncertainty of absolute\nChandra astrometry (0.6\u2032\u2032 at the 90% confidence level). The\nclose match between the X-ray and radio positions and the extended morphology of the observed X-ray emission allow us\nto conclude that we detected the X-ray emission from J1809\nand its PWN.\nThe brighter inner PWN component of an \u2248 12\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 3\u2032\u2032 size\n(i.e. 0.2 \u00d7 0.05 pc2 at d = 3.5 kpc) is elongated along the approximate symmetry axis (position angle \u2248 14\u25e6 east of north).\nThe linear profile of the surface brightness distribution along\nthe symmetry axis, extracted with the 4.9\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.49\u2032\u2032 (i.e. 10 \u00d7 1\npixels) sliding box, is shown in Figure 2. The inner PWN is\nsurrounded by a similarly elongated \u223c 20\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 40\u2032\u2032 \"halo\" of\nlower surface brightness, which we will call the outer PWN\ncomponent (see Fig. 1, top). In addition to these two relatively\ncompact components, the heavily binned and smoothed image (see Fig. 1, bottom right, and Fig. 3a) reveals even fainter\nlarge-scale extended emission, concentrated at the lower half\nof the S3 chip (south of the pulsar). The morphology of this\nemission (see also the ASCA image in Fig. 3c) indicates that\nit possibly extends further south but may not be discernible on\nthe S2 chip because of its lower sensitivity.\nThe only source on the S2 chip detected above the 3\u03c3 level\nis located at R.A. = 18h 09m 40.725s, decl. = \u221219\u25e6 25\u2032 44.10\u2032\u2032\n(the 1\u03c3 centroid uncertainty is 0.28\u2032\u2032 and 0.29\u2032\u2032 in right ascension and declination, respectively), well within the brightest central part of HESS J1809 (about 2\u2032 west of the peak of\nthe TeV brightness distribution; see Fig. 3). We designate\nthis source CXOU J180940.7\u2212192544 and call it Ch1 hereafter. Although Ch1 appears to be extended in the ACIS image, the point spread function (PSF) simulation shows that\nthis is likely the result of the off-axis location (off-axis angle\n\u03b8 = 7.\u2032 4). We find no significant large-scale non-uniformities\nin the X-ray background on the S2 chip (see Fig. 3).\nWe have also examined the S1 chip image and found\nonly one source detected above the 3\u03c3 level. The source,\nCXOU 180933.3\u2212192959 (hereafter Ch2), is located at\nR.A. = 18h 09m 33.336s, decl. = \u221219\u25e629\u2032 59.89\u2032\u2032 (the 1\u03c3 centroid uncertainty is 0.70\u2032\u2032 in R.A. and 0.74\u2032\u2032 in decl.), which\nis about 6\u2032 from the center of HESS J1809. The X-ray\nsource is consistent with being point-like; however, due to\nthe broadened PSF (FWHM \u2248 10\u2032\u2032 ) at the large off-axis angle (11.8\u2032 ), a compact extended source cannot be ruled out.\nWe have also searched for diffuse emission features on the\nS1 chip and produced an image corrected for the exposure\nmap non-uniformities (see Fig. 3b). In this image the X-ray\nemission is systematically brighter toward the western edge\nof the S1 chip, likely due to the imperfection of the monoenergetic (2 keV) exposure map correction at large off-axis\nangles (see, however, \u00a72.5). We found no traces of the radio SNRs G11.03\u20130.05 and G11.18+0.11 in the ACIS images\n\n\f3\n\nF IG . 1.- Top left: ACIS-S3 image of J1809 and its PWN (0.8\u20137 keV; pixel size 0.49\u2032\u2032 ).

The brightness and smoothing scales are chosen to show the fainter, more\nextended emission.\n\n(see Fig. 3).\n2.2. Spectral analysis\n2.2.1. PWN spectrum\n\nWe extracted the PWN spectra from two elliptical regions\nshown in Figure 1 (top right). The smaller elliptical region\n(of 25.1 arcsec2 area) encompasses the brighter inner PWN,\nwhile the larger elliptical region (of 399.4 arcsec2 area) includes the outer PWN component of a lower surface brightness. To avoid the contamination of the PWN spectrum by\nthe pulsar, we excluded from these regions the circular region\nof 1.46\u2032\u2032 radius centered on the brightest pixel. The background (367 counts in 5202 arcsec2 area, 0.3\u20138 keV band)\nwas measured from the 37\u2032\u2032 < r < 55\u2032\u2032 annulus centered on\nthe pulsar. The total numbers of counts extracted from the\nsmaller and larger elliptical regions (excluding the 1.46\u2032\u2032 radius circle) are 153 and 365, of which 99.2% and 92.4 % are\nexpected to come from the source, which gives 151 \u00b1 12 and\n337 \u00b1 19 PWN counts in the two regions. The observed PWN\nfluxes (in the 1\u20136 keV band) are Finner = (8.1 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10\u221214\nand Fpwn = (14.7 \u00b1 0.8) \u00d7 10\u221214 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 for the inner\nand the entire (inner+outer) PWN, respectively. The corresponding average intensities are Iinner = (4.4 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u221215 and\nIpwn = (3.7 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10\u221216 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 arcsec\u22122 .\nTo investigate the PWN spectral properties, we first fit the\n\nspectra for each of the two PWN regions with the absorbed\nPL model, allowing the hydrogen column density, nH , to\nvary. These fits result in spectral slopes \u0393pwn \u2248 1.2\u20132.0 and\nnH,22 \u223c 0.5\u20131.1 (the ranges correspond to the 68% confidence\nlevel for a single interesting parameter). The difference in\nthe best-fit parameters for the inner and the entire PWN (see\nFig. 4) is statistically insignificant. In particular, we see no\nspectral softening (expected due to synchrotron cooling) in\nthe spectrum extracted from the larger region (entire PWN)\ncompared to the spectrum of the inner PWN3 . Therefore, below we will use the better constrained best-fit parameters for\nthe entire PWN (see Figs. 5 and 6) whenever we refer to the\nPWN spectral properties.\nGiven the J1809's dispersion measure, DM = 197 cm\u22123\npc (i.e., electron column density ne = 6.08 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ), the\nnH,22 value of 0.72 (obtained from the fit to the spectrum of\nthe entire PWN) corresponds to the ISM ionization degree\nne /nH \u2248 8.4%, only slightly below the commonly used value\nof 10%, which corresponds to nH,22 = 0.61.

Because of the low surface brightness of this emission and large background contribution (\u223c 65%), the spectral fits yield inconclusive results.\nWith the absorption being fixed at nH,22 = 0.72, the fits with\nsingle PL and thermal plasma4 models give \u0393 = 2.3 \u00b1 0.3\n(\u03c72\u03bd \u2248 2) and kT = 0.67 \u00b1 0.08 keV, (\u03c72\u03bd \u2248 3). The main contribution to the large values of \u03c72\u03bd comes from high-energy\nchannels (& 4 keV and & 2 keV for PL and mekal, respectively), which suggests either a mixture of thermal and hard\nnon-thermal emission or varying \u0393 or kT within the extraction region.

Given the small number of counts\nand the large background contribution, we chose not to subtract the background but rather to fit it simultaneously with\nthe source spectrum, using an additional absorbed PL model\nwith the same nH as for the source. The pulsar's absorbed flux\nis Fpsr = (1.8 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10\u221214 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 1\u20136 keV band\n(aperture corrected).\nAlthough the absorbed PL model formally fits the pulsar\nspectrum indicating a soft PL (\u0393psr \u2248 2.6; see Table 2 and\nFigs. 7 and 8), the fit yields nH,22 \u2248 0.4, smaller than that\nfor the PL fit to the entire PWN spectrum. To obtain a better constrained fit, we fixed the hydrogen column density at\nnH,22 = 0.72, obtained above from the PL fit to the PWN spectrum. With this nH , the single PL fit is still acceptable, but\nit yields a large photon index, \u0393 = 3.2 \u00b1 0.4, suggesting a\nthermal emission contribution. A two-component, BB+PL,\nfit yields reasonable values of fitting parameters (see Table 2\nand Figs. 7\u20139), which, however, are poorly constrained because of the small number of photons detected. The slope of\nthe PL component is \u0393psr = 1.2 \u00b1 0.6, and its unabsorbed lu2\nminosity is Lpsr \u223c 4 \u00d7 1031d3.5\nergs s\u22121 in the 0.5\u22128 keV band.\nThe temperature and the projected area of the BB component\nare strongly correlated (see Fig. 9), which results in large uncertainties for these parameters. The best-fit temperature for\nthe BB component is T \u2248 2 MK, while the projected emit2\nting area, A \u223c 3 \u00d7 106 d3.5\nm2 , is smaller than that of the sur2\nface of a neutron star (\u03c0R \u223c 3 \u00d7 108 m2 ), but larger than the\nconventional polar cap area Apc = 2\u03c0 2 R3 /cP \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 105 m2 .\nThe corresponding bolometric luminosity, Lbol \u2261 4A\u03c3T 4 \u223c\n2\n1 \u00d7 1032d3.5\nergs s\u22121 .\n2.2.3.

Based on the PSF simulation, the extraction region contains \u2248 95% of point source\ncounts.

We found no counterparts to Ch1 in the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS;\nSkrutskie et al. 2006) or Digital Sky Survey (DSS2)5 catalogs,\nup to the limiting magnitudes Ks = 15.4, H = 16, J = 17.5,\nR = 19, and B = 21. The nearest optical/NIR source is a\n2MASS point source (J = 15.45 \u00b1 0.05, H = 13.10 \u00b1 0.05,\nK = 12.06 \u00b1 0.04) located at R.A. = 18h 09m 40.92s, decl. =\n\u221219\u25e625\u2032 45.7\u2032\u2032 . The 3.2\u2032\u2032 offset from the best-fit Ch1 position\nsubstantially exceeds the position uncertainty of \u2248 0.4\u2032\u2032 . Figure 3 shows that Ch1 is projected very close to the extended\nSource A seen in the radio and IR images.\nThe only NIR/optical source within the 5\u2032\u2032 radius of the Ch2\nposition is a star, NOMAD1 0705\u22120568334 in the NOMAD\ncatalog (Zacharias et al. 2005), offset by only 0.9\u2032\u2032 from Ch2.\nGiven the relatively large uncertainty of the Ch2 position (see\n\u00a72.1), the positions of the star and Ch2 can be considered coincident. The X-ray-to-optical flux ratio, FX /FV \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22123, is\ntypical for a K star with coronal X-ray emission (Maccacaro\net al. 1988). The soft X-ray spectrum of Ch2 and the opticalNIR magnitudes of the star (B = 14.96, V = 14.66, R = 14.19,\nJ = 13.35, H = 12.84, and K = 12.72) support such an interpretation. No Ch2 counterpart is seen in the NVSS 20 cm image\nor in the Spitzer 8 and 24 \u03bcm images.\nThe NVSS 20 cm image (45\u2032\u2032 restoring beam size) and the\n25\u2032\u2032 resolution images by Brogan et al. (2004) show two bright\ncompact radio sources (marked A and B in Fig. 3) projected\nnear the HESS source center, with the 1.4 GHz spectral fluxes\nof 0.3 Jy and 0.15 Jy for Source A and Source B, respectively. Within these sources, 6.7 GHz methanol masers have\nbeen detected (Pestalozzi et al. 2005): G10.95+0.02 in Source\nA (peak flux 15 Jy at 6.7 GHz, VLSR = 24 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 , neardistance 3.2 kpc) and G11.03+0.06 in Source B (peak flux 0.7\nJy at 6.7 GHz, VLSR = 20 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 , near-distance 2.9 kpc).\nBoth A and B are also very bright far-IR sources,\nIRAS 18067\u20131927 and IRAS 18067\u20131921 in the IRAS Point\nSource Catalog v2.1 (IPAC Infrared Science Archive6 ), with\npeak fluxes of 1292 and 513 Jy at 60 \u03bcm, respectively. The\nSpitzer IRAC 8 \u03bcm and MIPS 24 \u03bcm images (Fig. 3g,h; taken\nfrom the GLIMPSE survey7) show extended sources of irregular shape at these positions, with characteristic sizes of \u223c 1\u2032 .\nThey are not seen in the DSS and 2MASS images, which suggests that they are intrinsically very cold (T \u223c 70 K) and/or\nstrongly absorbed molecular/dust complexes.\nThe Spitzer images also reveal an extended source with\nan interesting morphology (shell-like in the 24 \u03bcm image),\nlocated \u223c 10\u2032 southwest of the HESS J1809 center (see\nFig. 3g,h). The source has an extended radio counterpart\n(NVSS 180919\u2013192904) clearly seen in the 20 cm image\nshown in the same figure. It has been detected by Helfand\net al. (2006) in the Multi-Array Galactic Plane Survey (MAG5\n6\n7\n\nsee http://archive.eso.org/dss/dss\nhttp://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/\nhttp://www.astro.wisc.edu/sirtf/\n\n\f8\nPIS) and proposed to be an SNR candidate G10.8750+0.0875.\nIt is possible that this extended source contributes to the nonuniform X-ray background on the S1 chip (see \u00a72.1 and Fig.\n3b). The SNR candidates G11.03\u22120.05 and G11.18+0.11\n(Brogan et al. 2004; see Fig. 3b) are too faint to be seen in\nthe shallow NVSS images.\n3. DISCUSSION.\n\nThe sub-arcsecond angular resolution of Chandra has allowed us to resolve the compact J1809 PWN, disentangle\nthe pulsar and the extended emission components, and measure their properties separately. Thanks to the very low ACIS\nbackground, we were also able to detect the faint large-scale\nemission surrounding the compact PWN. The observation has\nalso provided serendipitous coverage of the central part of\nthe extended TeV source HESS J1809 and revealed two X-ray\nsources bright enough to permit spectral measurements and\naccurate determination of their positions. In this section we\ndiscuss some implementations of our findings.\n3.1. The J1809 PWN\n3.1.1. Luminosity and spectrum\n\nAt the plausible distance of 3.5 kpc, the unabsorbed X-ray\nluminosity of the compact PWN, Lpwn \u223c 4\u00d71032 ergs s\u22121 , corresponds to the X-ray efficiency, \u03b7pwn \u2261 Lpwn /\u0116 \u223c 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22124,\nsimilar to those of PWNe around younger and more powerful\nVela-like pulsars (see Fig. 10). Some of the detected X-ray\nPWNe associated with older and less powerful pulsars have\nsimilar or higher X-ray efficiencies (e.g., \u03b7pwn \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 and\n4\u00d710\u22124 for J1509\u20135850 [\u03c4 = 150 kyr] and B0355+54 [\u03c4 = 560\nkyr], respectively; Kargaltsev et al., in preparation), while\nothers show much lower efficiencies (e.g., \u03b7pwn \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22125\nand 7 \u00d7 10\u22126 for PRS J1740+1000 [\u03c4 = 100 kyr] and Geminga\n[\u03c4 = 340 kyr], respectively; Kargaltsev et al., in preparation;\nPavlov et al. 2006). This indicates that \u03b7pwn is not significantly correlated with \u03c4 or \u0116, at least for young and middleaged pulsars (\u03c4 . 1 Myr), perhaps because, in addition to \u0116\nand \u03c4 , it depends on other factors (e.g., the pulsar's speed and\nthe angle between the spin and magnetic axes).\nThe spectral slope of the J1809 PWN, \u0393pwn = 1.4 \u00b1 0.1, is\nsimilar to those of the PWNe around Vela-like pulsars (listed\nin Table 2 of Kargaltsev et al. 2007a, hereafter KPG07a), except for two bow-shock PWNe with prominent tails, J1747\u2013\n2958 (the Mouse; Gaensler et al. 2004) and B1757\u201324 (the\nDuck; Kaspi et al. 2001), which show softer spectra (\u0393 =\n2.0 \u00b1 0.2 and 2.5 \u00b1 0.3, respectively). Comparing the J1809\nspectrum with those of older PWNe, we see that it is similar\nto the spectra of relatively compact PWNe (e.g., \u0393 = 1.4 \u00b1 0.3\nfor the bright part of the B0355+54 PWN; McGowan et al.\n2006), but it is harder than the spectra of the extended tails\nin J1740+1000 and J1509\u20135850 PWNe (\u0393 = 1.8 \u00b1 0.4 and\n2.2 \u00b1 0.3, respectively; Kargaltsev et al., in preparation). It\nhints that PWN spectra are correlated with PWN morphology\nrather than with the pulsar age and spindown power.\n3.1.2. PWN morphology\n\nThe unknown proper motion of J1809 and the faintness of\nthe surrounding large-scale emission complicate the interpretation of the observed PWN, but its \"cometary\" appearance\nstrongly suggests that the pulsar's motion plays a major role.\n\n3.1.2.1. Bow shock in a nearly isotropic pulsar wind? -\nThe compact J1809 PWN is elongated approximately along\n\nF IG . 10.- PWN luminosity versus pulsar spin-down power showing J1809\nand 10 Vela-like pulsars observed with Chandra. The luminosities are estimated for the 0.5\u20138 keV band. The dash-dot lines are the lines of constant\nPWN efficiency, \u03b7pwn . The error bars include the statistical uncertainties and\nthe nominal 30% distance uncertainties, except for the Vela pulsar whose\nparallax has been measured (Dodson et al. 2003a).\n\nthe north-south direction, with the pulsar located much closer\nto its southern end (see Fig. 1). Such a cometary morphology\ncan be attributed to a bow shock created by the pulsar moving\nsupersonically in the southern direction (P.A. \u2248 194\u25e6). The\napex of the termination shock (TS) of the pulsar wind is located at the distance\n\u00151/2\n\u0014\n\u0116 f\u03a9\n(1)\nRh \u2248\n4\u03c0c(pamb + pram )\nahead of the pulsar. At this distance, the pulsar wind pressure, pw = \u0116 f\u03a9 (4\u03c0crs2 )\u22121 ( f\u03a9 takes into account anisotropy\nof the pulsar wind), is balanced by the sum of the ambient\npressure, pamb = \u03c1kT (\u03bcmH )\u22121 = 1.38 \u00d7 10\u221212n\u03bc\u22121 T4 ergs cm\u22123 ,\nand the ram pressure, pram = \u03c1v2 = 1.67 \u00d7 10\u221210nv27 ergs cm\u22123\n(T4 = T /104 K, v7 = v/107 cm s\u22121 , \u03bc is the molecular weight,\nand n = \u03c1/mH is in units of cm\u22123 ). Assuming pram \u226b pamb\n(or M \u226b 1, where M = v/cs is the Mach number, cs =\n1/2\n(5kT /3\u03bcmH )1/2 = 12\u03bc\u22121/2 T4 km s\u22121 is the sound speed in\n1/2\nthe ambient medium), we obtain Rh = 1.7 \u00d7 1017n\u22121/2 f\u03a9 v\u22121\n7\ncm.\nThe shocked pulsar wind, observed in X-rays as a bowshock PWN, is confined between the TS and the contact discontinuity (CD) surface. For M \u226b 1 and a nearly isotropic\npreshock wind with a low magnetization parameter \u03c3, the TS\nacquires a bullet-like shape (Bucciantini et al. 2005, hereafter\nB05). The distance Rh between the pulsar and the bullet head\nis given by equation (1), while the CD surface head is at a distance \u2248 1.3Rh from the pulsar. Assuming that the sharp rise\nin the brightness profile (Fig. 2) at about 3\u2032\u2032 from the pulsar\n(i.e. 1.6 \u00d7 1017d3.5 cm in the plane of the sky) corresponds to\nthe CD head, we can estimate the pulsar velocity,\n\u22121\nv \u223c 140 n\u22121/2d3.5\nf\u03a9 sin i km s\u22121 ,\n1/2\n\n\u22121/2\n\n(2)\n\n\u22121\nsin i,\nand the Mach number, M \u223c 12n\u22121/2 T4 \u03bc1/2 f\u03a9 d3.5\nwhere i is the angle between the velocity vector and the line\nof sight.\nThe observed projected length, \u223c 12\u2032\u2032 , and width, \u223c 3\u2032\u2032 , of\nthe inner PWN are close to the length \u223c 7Rh \u223c 15\u2032\u2032 , and width,\n1/2\n\n\f9\n\u223c Rh \u223c 2\u2032\u2032 , of the TS bullet, predicted by the B05 models for\n\u03c3 \u223c a few \u00d7 10\u22123 . The width of the outer PWN, \u223c 20\u2032\u2032 , can\nbe interpreted as the diameter of the CD shell (approximately\ncylindrical behind the pulsar, with a diameter \u223c 8Rh \u223c 18\u2032\u2032 ,\naccording to B05).\nThe B05 models also predict a tail behind the back surface\nof the TS bullet, where the collimated shocked pulsar wind\nflows with subrelativistic velocities: 0.1c\u20130.3c in the inner\nchannel with a cylindrical radius \u223c Rh (\u223c 2\u2032\u2032 in our case), and\nup to 0.8c\u20130.9c in the outer channel, confined between the\ncylindrical surfaces with radii \u223c Rh and \u223c 4Rh . The lack of\nan extended tail in the ACIS images is puzzling; it could be\ndue to a relatively low Mach number of the pulsar and insufficient sensitivity of the short ACIS exposure. On the other\nhand, the shape of the faint thin feature northeast of inner\nPWN hints that it may be a bent extension of the inner PWN,\nwhich is difficult to explain if this is a strongly collimated,\nmildly relativistic flow just behind the back surface of the TS\nbullet (unless the flow is subject to kink instabilities). However, statistical significance of this feature is too low to draw\nany definitive conclusions.\n\n3.1.2.2. Effects of pulsar wind anisotropy. - We should note\nthat the B05 models assume an isotropic pulsar wind ( f\u03a9 = 1).\nWe know from observations of young pulsars, such as Crab\nand Vela, that the wind is not isotropic, but it is mostly confined to the equatorial plane. In addition, in young PWNe we\noften see jets along the pulsar's spin axis. These jets can be\nformed by polar outflows originating in the pulsar magnetosphere or they can be created by tangential inflows just outside the equatorial TS surface converging toward the spin axis\n(Komissarov & Lyubarsky 2004). We are unaware of PWN\nmodels that include both the pulsar wind anisotropy and the\nram pressure effects. We can, however, expect that, in the case\nof an anisotropic wind, the PWN morphology, at least close\nto the pulsar, would depend on the orientation of the spin axis\nwith respect to the pulsar's velocity.\nAs Chandra observations have shown, the spin axis is oriented along the direction of pulsar's motion in a number of\nyoung pulsars (e.g., Ng & Romani 2004). In this case, we\nexpect that the equatorial outflow would form a shell between\nthe TS and the CD surface behind the pulsar, filled by a relativistic plasma with a subrelativistic bulk flow velocity. The\nmorphology of the X-ray emission from such a PWN would\nbe generally similar to that in the case of isotropic wind, although we may expect to see a shell-like (rather than filled)\nPWN appearance at sufficiently high resolution. Such a structure (\"outer tails\") is possibly seen in the Geminga PWN (Caraveo et al. 2003; Pavlov et al. 2006). As for the jets coaligned\nwith the pulsar velocity vector, the rear jet is expected to be\nseen along the axis of the shell filled by the shocked equatorial wind behind the pulsar (at least if the jet originates from\nthe pulsar magnetosphere), as observed in the Geminga PWN\n(Pavlov et al. 2006). The front jet is expected to pierce the\nhead of the shell (as f\u03a9 \u226b 1 in the jet), and it can be seen\nahead of the pulsar unless it is crushed by the ram pressure.\nThe jets could be of quite different brightness and length because of the Doppler boosting and different effective pressures in front and behind the pulsar.\nIn the case of J1809, the high-resolution images shown in\nFigure 1 indicate the presence of a narrow structure (with a\nlinear extent of \u2243 3\u2032\u2032 ) just south of the pulsar, which might\nbe interpreted as a front jet. Furthermore, the heavily binned\nlow-resolution image (Fig. 3b) shows a faint structure extend-\n\ning in the direction of the presumed pulsar's proper motion.\nAlthough tentative, the structure is consistent with the X-ray\nmorphology seen in the ASCA GIS image (Fig. 3c). Therefore, one could speculate that these structures are connected\nto each other and could be parts of the front jet. In this interpretation, the rear jet may contribute to the inner PWN\nemission, and the above-mentioned bent extension of the inner PWN (\u00a73.1.2.1) could represent the outer part of the rear\njet. Although barely supported by the existing data, the jet\nhypothesis offers a way to explain the offset large-scale X-ray\n(and TeV) emission south of the pulsar, which cannot be associated with the shocked pulsar wind under the assumption\nof wind isotropy. We speculate that this emission could be\nproduced by particles supplied through the front jet (similar\nto the Vela PWN; Pavlov et al. 2003; Kargaltsev & Pavlov\n2004). However, to account for the luminous TeV emission\n2\n(L\u03b3 \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22122d3.5\n\u0116), the front jet would have to carry a substantial fraction of the pulsar's spindown power, unlike the\nnorthwest jet of the Vela PWN whose energy injection rate is\nonly \u223c 10\u22123 \u0116.\nWe cannot also exclude a possibility that the spin axis of\nthe J1809 pulsar, and hence the PWN jets, are substantially\nmisaligned with the direction of pulsar motion. For instance,\none could assume that the jets are nearly perpendicular to the\nvelocity vector (i.e. this vector lies in the equatorial plane; a\npossible example is PSR B1706\u201344 and its PWN; Romani et\nal. 2005). In this case, the jets would be bent backwards (or\neven destroyed) by the ram pressure of the oncoming ambient medium, while the TS in the equatorial outflow (ring-like\nwithout ram pressure applied) would turn into an ellipse-like\nstructure elongated in the direction of pulsar motion, with the\npulsar displaced along the major axis toward the TS head. The\nobservational appearance of the shocked pulsar wind would\nthen depend on the inclination of the orbital plane to the line\nof sight, but at most inclinations we would see an elongated\nstructure with the pulsar shifted from the center of the PWN in\nthe direction of the velocity vector, in a qualitative agreement\nwith the observed shape of the inner PWN. Of course, such an\ninterpretation would imply a higher pulsar velocity than that\nestimated above for a nearly isotropic pulsar wind (see eq.\n[2]). On the other hand, in such a geometry the wind could\npropagate to larger distances ahead of the pulsar because the\nCD could be easier destroyed by various instabilities, and\nthe pulsar wind would be mixed with the shocked ambient\nmedium. We note, however, that this picture can hardly explain the large-scale X-ray emission south-southwest of the\npulsar, which, in this case, could be attributed to the host SNR\nor the crushed relic PWN (see \u00a73.3 and \u00a73.4.2, respectively).\nOverall, we can conclude that the observed PWN morphology is generally consistent with the assumption of the supersonic pulsar motion, which implies a low ambient pres\u22122\nsure (e.g., pamb \u226a 2 \u00d7 10\u221210 f\u03a9 d3.5\nsin2 i ergs cm\u22123 for a nearly\nisotropic pulsar wind). On the other hand, modeling of magnetized anisotropic winds from fast-moving pulsars, deeper\nX-ray observations, and proper motion measurements are\nneeded to firmly establish the nature of the J1809 PWN and\ninfer its properties quantitatively.\n3.2. The pulsar\n\nThe spectrum of the J1809 pulsar is less certain than that of\nthe PWN. Although the one-component PL model formally\nfits the spectrum, the fit yields a rather large \u0393 \u2243 2.6 \u2212 3.2\nand suggests a smaller nH than the one obtained from the\n\n\f10\nPL fit to a better quality PWN spectrum. An alternative\ndescription of the pulsar spectrum is provided by the twocomponent PL+BB model that is often used to fit the spectra\nof young and middle-aged pulsars (see, e.g., KPG07a and references therein). The PL component of the PL+BB fit gives\n\u0393psr \u2243 1.2 \u00b1 0.6, similar to \u0393pwn and to the spectral slopes\nof other pulsars of similar ages (see e.g., KPG07a). In any\n\u22121/2\ncase, the slope is much softer than \u0393psr = 2.1 \u2212 2.9\u011636 \u2248 0.1\npredicted by the Gotthelf's (2003) correlation. The X-ray effi2\nciency of the pulsar, \u03b7psr \u2261 Lpsr /\u0116 \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22125d3.5\nin the 0.5\u20138\nkeV band, is also not unusual for Vela-like pulsars, as well as\nthe ratio Lpwn /Lpsr \u223c 10 (see KPG07a).\nThe possible thermal component of the PL+BB fit is poorly\nconstrained, not only because of the scarce statistics but also\nbecause the soft thermal radiation is strongly absorbed by the\nISM. The BB temperature, T \u223c 1.7\u20132.3 MK, emitting area\nA \u223c 106 \u2013107 m2 , and bolometric luminosity, Lbol\npsr \u223c (0.632\n\u22121\n1.6) \u00d7 10 ergs s , are similar to those found from the\nPL+BB fits for Vela-like pulsars. The temperature is a factor of two higher than the NS surface temperatures predicted\nby standard NS cooling models for the 50 kyr age (e.g.,\nYakovlev & Pethick 2004), and the corresponding emitting\narea is smaller than the NS surface area. However, the actual\nspectrum of the NS thermal radiation can differ substantially\nfrom the BB model. In particular, fitting the spectra with hydrogen atmosphere models (Pavlov et al. 1995) yields lower\neffective temperatures and larger emitting areas (see Pavlov et\nal. 2001a for the specific example of the Vela pulsar). Unfortunately, the quality of the data does not warrant fits with more\ncomplicated atmosphere models. Unlike the temperature and\nthe area, the bolometric luminosity is not so sensitive to the\npresence and properties of the NS atmosphere. The comparison with the NS cooling models shows that the J1809's bolometric luminosity is a factor of \u223c 10 lower than predicted by\nthe \"basic\" theoretical cooling curve (MNS = 1.3M\u2299 , no superfluidity); it is consistent with the cooling curves for heavier\nNSs (e.g., MNS = 1.5\u20131.6 M\u2299) for various superfluidity models (Yakovlev & Pethick 2004).\n3.3. Host SNR\n\nWith the velocity given by Equation (2), the pulsar would\n\u22121 1/2\nhave traveled a distance of \u223c 7n\u22121/2 d3.5\nf\u03a9 sin i pc during the\ntime equal to its spindown age, \u03c4 = 51 kyr. This corresponds\n\u22122 1/2\nto a displacement of \u223c 7\u2032 n\u22121/2 d3.5\nf\u03a9 sin2 i in the plane of\n\u22122 1/2\nthe sky and, for n\u22121/2 d3.5\nf\u03a9 sin2 i \u223c 0.6, places the sky projection of the pulsar's birthplace close to the apparent center\nof the radio SNR G11.18+0.11 (see Fig. 3b), suggesting that\nJ1809 and G11.18+0.11 were created by the same supernova\nexplosion. This conjecture implies that the pulsar has overtaken the SNR shell and left the high-pressure SNR interiors,\nwhich is consistent with the assumption pamb \u226a pram , used to\nobtain the pulsar velocity estimate. This could explain why\nJ1809 looks so different from those Vela-like PWNe that do\nnot show cometary morphology because they are moving subsonically in high-pressure SNR interiors (see KPG07a for examples). However, if G11.18+0.11 is at d \u2248 3.5 kpc (the presumed distance to J1809), then its size, D \u2248 8d3.5 pc, would\nbe surprisingly small for a 50 kyr old SNR, unless it is expanding in an unusually dense environment. To get more consistent SNR age and size, we have to assume a larger distance\nand a smaller pulsar's true age, which would require a lower\nambient density around J1809 to match the pulsar's birth-\n\nplace with the center of G11.18+0.11, resulting in a higher\ninferred pulsar velocity and Mach number. For instance, if\nwe assume d = 5 kpc (i.e., D \u223c 11 pc) and the true age = 20\nkyr, then n \u223c 0.1 f\u03a9 sin4 i cm\u22123 is required, which corresponds\n\u22121/2\nto v \u223c 300(sin i)\u22121 km s\u22121 , M \u223c 25T4 \u03bc1/2 (sin i)\u22121 . Thus,\ngiven the uncertainty of the pulsar's true age and distance, we\ncannot rule out the possibility that G11.18+0.01 is the host\nSNR for J1809.\nIt is also possible that G11.18+0.01 is just a background\nSNR accidentally projected near the pulsar. In this case, the\nreal host SNR might be associated with the extended emission around J1809 seen in the Chandra and ASCA images\n(Fig. 1, bottom right and Fig. 3c). The faintness of the largescale X-ray emission does not allow one to determine its origin (thermal or nonthermal) and, therefore, thermal plasma\nemission from the SNR interior cannot be excluded until better quality data are obtained (see \u00a72.2.1). However, the size of\nthis putative SNR is too small, and, more importantly, the observed PWN morphology does not look consistent with this\nhypothesis. Therefore, it seems more plausible that the extended emission is synchrotron radiation related to the PWN\n(see \u00a73.1.2.2) rather than thermal emission from hot gas in\nSNR interior. Measuring the X-ray spectrum of the extended\nemission in a deeper observation would distinguish between\nthese possibilities.\nOne could also speculate that the host SNR is not seen because its size is larger than the field-of-view of our observation (& 20 pc at d = 3.5 kpc), and the SNR interior has become cold enough (T . 105 K) to provide M \u226b 1 and be\nundetectable in X-rays. This option remains quite viable if\nthe pulsar's true age is close to (or exceeds) its spindown age.\n3.4. Origin of HESS J1809\n\nTeV radiation can be produced by the inverse Compton\nscattering (ICS) of low-frequency radiation (e.g., the cosmic microwave background radiation [CMBR]) off relativistic\nelectrons. Alternatively, it can be generated by the \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 + \u03b3\ndecay, the \u03c0 0 mesons being produced when relativistic protons interact with the ambient matter. Therefore, to understand the nature of a TeV source, one should identify the\nsource of relativistic particles and the target with which these\nparticles interact.\n3.4.1. Possible targets where the TeV radiation is produced\n\nThe omnipresent target for relativistic electrons producing\nTeV photons by the ICS is the CMBR, with the energy density UCMBR = 0.26 eV cm\u22123 . To produce TeV photons with\nenergy E\u03b3 by upscattering the CMBR photons with energy\n\u01eb \u223c 3kT \u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV, electrons with the Lorentz factor\n1/2\n1/2\n\u03b3 \u223c 5 \u00d7 107ETeV [i.e. Ee \u223c 25ETeV TeV] are required, where\nETeV = E\u03b3 /(1 TeV). As \u03b3\u01eb \u223c 20\u2013100 keV \u226a me c2 for E\u03b3 \u223c 1\u2013\n20 TeV, the ICS occurs in the Thompson regime. The same\nrelativistic electrons produce synchrotron photons with energy\nEsyn \u223c \u03b3 2 h\u03bdcyc \u223c 5\u03b372 B\u22125 eV \u223c 0.1\n\nETeV B\u22125\nkeV , (3)\n\u01eb/(4 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV)\n\nwhere \u03b37 = \u03b3/107 and B\u22125 = B/(10 \u03bcG).\nClose to the Galactic plane, where HESS J1809 is situated, a factor of a few higher radiation energy density can\nbe provided by IR emission from interstellar dust and Galactic starlight. For instance, the models of interstellar radiation\n\n\f11\nfield by Strong et al. (2000) give the energy densities of 0.6\nand 2.7 eV cm\u22123 for these two components, respectively, at\nthe galactocentric distance of \u223c 4 kpc. Since the ICS pro\u22121\nceeds in the Klein-Nishina (K.-N.) regime for \u01eb & 1ETeV\neV\n(i.e., the K.-N. effects become important at \u01eb & a few \u00d7 10\u22122\neV for the high-energy end of the TeV photon spectrum), we\nshould use a more general formula for estimating the electron\nLorentz factor:\nh\n\u00011/2 i\n2\n,\n(4)\n+ ETeV/\u01ebeV\n\u03b3 \u223c 106 ETeV + ETeV\n\nwhere \u01ebeV = \u01eb/(1 eV).\nThe electrons with such a\nLorentz factor generate synchrotron photons with energy\nh\n\u00011/2 i2\n2\nB\u22125 eV. For inEsyn \u223c 0.05 ETeV + ETeV\n+ ETeV/\u01ebeV\n\nstance, electrons with \u03b3 \u223c 2 \u00d7 107 (i.e. Ee \u223c 40 TeV) produce photons with E\u03b3 = 10 TeV by upscattering background\nstarlight photons with a typical energy \u01eb \u223c 1 eV, and the same\nelectrons produce synchrotron radiation in a far-UV range,\nEsyn \u223c 6 eV, in an interstellar field of 3 \u03bcG. Although the radiation energy density of the starlight can substantially exceed\nthat of the CMBR, the emissivity is reduced by the smaller\nCompton cross section in the K.-N. regime and smaller photon number density.\nThe radiation energy density and photon number density\n(hence TeV emissivity) can be enhanced in the vicinity of very\nbright sources. The radiation energy density at an angular\ndistance \u03b8 from a source of radiation can be estimated as U =\nF/(c\u03b82 ), where F is the source energy flux observed at Earth;\nit exceed the ambient radiation energy density, Uamb , at\n\u03b8 > (F/cUamb )1/2 .\n\n(5)\n\nThe multiwavelength data show two very bright radio-IR\nobjects near the center of HESS J1809 \u2013 Source A and Source\nB (see Fig. 3), which are likely molecular-dust complexes in\nstar-forming regions. An approximate integration of the spectral flux of Source A gives its total flux FA \u223c 10\u22127 ergs cm\u22122\n2\ns\u22121 (i.e. the luminosity LA \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 1038 d3.5\nergs s\u22121 ). This\nmeans that the radiation energy density near this source exceeds Uamb at \u03b8 < 5\u2032 (Uamb /1 eV cm\u22123 )\u22121/2 . For instance, if the\nTeV emission is produced by the ICS of IR photons with energies around \u01eb \u223c 0.02 eV (which corresponds to the maximum\nspectral flux of Source A), and Uamb \u223c 0.1 eV cm\u22123 in this\nenergy range, then U > Uamb at \u03b8 . 15\u2032 . This value is close\nto the observed radius of HESS J1809, which suggests that\nthe sphere of \u223c 10 pc of the enhanced radiation field around\nSource A might be the target where the TeV emission is produced by the ICS off the relativistic electrons supplied by a\nnearby source [Lorentz factors \u03b3 \u223c (0.5\u20136) \u00d7 107 are required\nto upscatter the IR photons to E\u03b3 = 0.5\u201320 TeV]. Similar estimates hold for Source B, whose flux is a factor of 2.5 lower,\nand the size \u03b8 is a factor of 1.6 smaller, than those for Source\nA. The hypothesis that the \"photon sphere\" of Source A or\nSource B is the site where the TeV emission is produced via\nICS could be verified by detection of the accompanying synchrotron radiation. However, most of the energy range of the\ncorresponding synchrotron emission, Esyn \u223c (1\u2013200)B\u22125 eV,\nis subject to the strong interstellar absorption.\nIn principle, the TeV emission could be initiated by highenergy nucleons supplied by some source (e.g., a pulsar),\nwhich produce decaying \u03c0 0 mesons in collisions with nucleons of the ambient medium (e.g., Horns et al. 2006). The\ntarget in this case would the nucleonic component of the\ncircumpulsar medium, and we should expect enhanced TeV\n\nemission in dense, cold clouds, if there are such clouds close\nto the source of high-energy nucleons. The lack of an extended IR or radio counterpart of a size similar to that of\nHESS J1809 (which would indicate the presence of a large\nmolecular cloud) suggests that the TeV source is not associated with a localized target for high-energy nucleons.\n3.4.2. Possible sources of relativistic particles\n\nIn the case of HESS J1809, the natural source of relativistic\nelectrons (and possibly protons) is the J1809 pulsar. In addition to that, there are the Ch1 and Ch2 X-ray sources and\nthe radio SNR G11.03-0.05, all projected close the center of\nHESS J809 (see Fig. 3). Finally, relativistic particles might be\nproduced by acceleration mechanisms in the forward shock of\nthe putative host SNR of the J1809 pulsar.\nThe soft X-ray spectrum of Ch2 and the positional coincidence with a field star suggest that the X-ray emission comes\nfrom an active stellar corona. Therefore, we conclude that\nCh2 is not related to HESS J1809.\nIf the shell-like radio SNR G11.03\u20130.05 were a powerful source of relativistic electrons, its synchrotron radiation\nwould have been seen in the X-ray range. Since no X-rays\nat the SNR location are detected in our Chandra observation,\nthis SNR is not a viable candidate for the source of relativistic\nparticles that powers HESS J1809.\nAs we have discussed in \u00a73.1.2 and \u00a73.3, the faint, largescale X-ray emission south of the J1809 pulsar is likely not\nthe host SNR of this pulsar, but it is rather related to the J1809\nPWN. Moreover, TeV \u03b3-ray emission from an SNR shock is\nusually associated with the SNR shell, not the interior. Current radio, X-ray and \u03b3-ray data provide no evidence of such\na shell around J1809. Therefore, even if the large-scale X-ray\nemission belongs to the host SNR, HESS J1809 is unlikely to\nbe powered by particles accelerated in the forward shock of\nthis SNR.\nAmong the X-ray sources detected with Chandra, Ch1 is\nthe closest to the projected HESS J1809 center (Fig. 3). The\nlack of an IR-optical counterpart and the large lower limit\non the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio, FX /Fopt & 3, mean that the\nX-ray emission from Ch1 comes not from a usual field star.\nOn the other hand, the absorbing hydrogen column density,\nnH,22 = 1.2 \u00b1 0.4, is close to that of the J1809 PWN, which\nsuggests that Ch1 is a Galactic object, not an AGN observed\nthrough the Galactic plane. The slope of the Ch1 spectrum,\n\u0393 = 1.4 \u00b1 0.4, suggests that it may be either an X-ray binary\nor a remote PWN unresolved because of the far off-axis location. With the optical extinction estimated from the measured nH value (e.g., AV \u223c 4\u20139), the limits on the optical-NIR\nmagnitudes (see \u00a72.5) virtually exclude a high mass X-ray\nbinary. Although a low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) in a quiescent state could have an X-ray luminosity comparable to\nthat of Ch1, LCh1 \u223c 3 \u00d7 1032(d/4 kpc)2 ergs s\u22121 , LMXBs are\nnot known to be sources of TeV emission. If Ch1 is a young\npulsar with a PWN, then it might provide relativistic particles\nneeded for generating the TeV emission. (We should note,\nhowever, that the TeV-to-X-ray flux ratio, \u223c 150, would be\nmuch higher than the values, \u223c 0.01\u20133, inferred for most of\nthe other TeV PWNe, except for the B1800\u201321, for which\nthe ratio is about 100; see Table 2 in Kargaltsev et al. 2007b,\nhereafter KPG07b, and references therein). To assess the likelihood of Ch1 being the source of relativistic particles for\nHESS J1809, a deeper Chandra observation is needed, with\nCh1 imaged close to the telescope's optical axis.\nAnother plausible physical counterpart to HESS J1809 is\n\n\f12\nthe J1809 pulsar/PWN. To date, young pulsars have been\nfound in the vicinity of \u223c 10 extended TeV sources (e.g., de\nJager 2006; Gallant 2007), and the likelihood of this happening by chance is very low (see, e.g., KPG07b). The ratio\nof the TeV flux of HESS J1809 to the X-ray flux the J1809\nPWN (including the outer component of the compact PWN)\nis about 100, higher than those observed in most TeV plerions (KPG07b). However, if one adds in the X-ray flux of\nthe large-scale extended emission (\u00a72.2.1), then the ratio decreases down to \u223c 20 (or even lower if one includes the diffuse\nemission of a larger extent, seen by ASCA; see Fig. 3c).\nThe center of the brightest part of HESS J1809 is offset\nfrom J1809 by \u2248 8\u2032 , almost in the direction of the presumed\npulsar motion. Such an offset is comparable to the 10\u2032 \u201320\u2032\noffsets found in most of TeV plerions (including the most\nsecure associations PSR B0833\u201345/HESS J0835\u2013455 [Vela]\nand PSR B1823\u201313/HESS J1825\u2013137). An obvious explanation for such an offset is that the photons for the ICS are provided by a compact source (e.g., Source A) whose center lies\nat some distance from the pulsar (\u2265 8d3.5 pc for Source A).\nAlso, the offset might be due to the anisotropic supply of relativistic particles through the putative front jet (see \u00a73.1.2).\nIf the TeV emission is produced by the ICS of an approximately uniform background radiation, such as the CMBR or\nGalactic starlight, then the origin of the offsets and the asymmetries of the extended X-ray and TeV PWN components\ncould be attributed to the reverse SNR shock that had propagated through the nonhomogeneous SNR interior and reached\none side of the PWN sooner than the other side, crushing the\nPWN and sweeping its contents along (Blondin et al. 2001).\nOne can assume that the TeV source HESS J1809 is powered\nby this relic crushed PWN, whose relativistic electrons have\nnot lost all their energy to synchrotron radiation because of,\ne.g., a lower magnetic field, while the compact PWN in the\npulsar vicinity is created by fresh electrons, recently injected\nfrom the pulsar magnetosphere. As the electrons responsible for the TeV emission have been accumulating during a\nsubstantial fraction of the pulsar's lifetime, and the pulsar's\nspindown power was higher in the past, this hypothesis could\n2\nexplain the uncomfortably large ratio, \u223c 0.01d3.5\n, of the TeV\nluminosity to the current spindown power. (A similar explanation has been suggested by Aharonian et al. 2006 for the\nPSR B1823\u201313/HESS J1825\u2013137 association.) This hypothesis can be tested with deep radio observations, which should\nbe able to detect the synchrotron emission from the relic electrons of the crushed PWN.\nIn the above picture, the asymmetric extended X-ray emission south of the J1809 pulsar could also be associated with\nthe crushed PWN and considered as an X-ray (synchrotron)\ncounterpart of the TeV (IC) source HESS J1809. The small\nsize of the extended X-ray emission, in comparison with the\nsize of the TeV source, and its offset from the center of\nHESS J1809 could be attributed to the lower sensitivity of the\nACIS chip S2 (where the central part of HESS J1809 is imaged \u2013 see Fig. 3a) or to a lower magnetic field in the central\npart. A deeper X-ray observation could distinguish between\nthese two possibilities.\nThe large-scale morphology of the X-ray emission around\nJ1809 is remarkably similar to that around PSR B1823\u201313,\nwhich powers the X-ray PWN G18.0\u20130.7 (LX \u223c 3 \u00d7 1033 ergs\ns\u22121 , angular size & 5\u2032 ; Gaensler et al. 2003). In addition to\nthe extended low-surface-brightness component, the B1823\u2013\n13 PWN has a much more compact (5\u2032\u2032 \u201310\u2032\u2032 ) brighter core,\nresolved by Chandra (Teter et al. 2004). The TeV emission\n\nfrom HESS 1825\u2013137 covers an area much larger than the\nX-ray PWN area, extending up to 1\u25e6 southward from the pulsar (Aharonian et al. 2006). However, just as in the case of\nPSR J1809/HESS J1809, both the TeV and the low-surfacebrightness X-ray emission have similar shapes, and they are\noffset in the same direction with respect to the pulsar position.\nFinally, we would like to point out that there are two other\nyoung pulsars, J1811\u20131925 and J1809\u20131943, at distances of\n\u2248 24\u2032 and \u2248 19\u2032 , respectively, from the HESS J1809 center. PSR J1811\u20131925 can not be related to HESS J1809 since\nit has been associated with G11.2\u20130.3 (Kaspi et al. 2001),\nwhose diameter, \u2248 4\u2032 , is substantially smaller than the offset\nfrom HESS J1809. PSR J1809\u20131943 is the radio counterpart\nof the transient Anomalous X-ray Pulsar (AXP) XTE J1810\u2013\n197 (Halpern et al. 2005, and references therein). Its association with HESS J1809 does not look very plausible because\nof the large spatial offset and because its properties are quite\ndifferent from those of the young pulsars found in the vicinity\nof other TeV sources (no TeV emission from AXPs have been\nreported so far).\nThus, based on the current data, only two objects, the J1809\npulsar/PWN and, less likely, Ch1, are plausible candidates for\nthe source of relativistic particles powering HESS J1809. In\nboth cases, the TeV emission is generated by ICS of either IR\nphotons from Source A (or Source B) or CMBR photons. To\ndiscriminate between different possibilities, the nature of Ch1\nshould be established in deep, high-resolution Chandra observations, and the extended X-ray PWN emission should be\nstudied in a deep XMM-Newton exposure. The synchrotron\nemission from the alleged relic PWN could be detected in\ndeep radio observations.\n4. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have detected the X-ray emission from PSR B1809\u201319\nand its synchrotron nebula. The X-ray efficiency and spectrum of the PWN are similar to those of many other compact\nPWNe, both younger and older than J1809. The cometary\nshape of the compact PWN suggests that the pulsar is moving\nsupersonically, but no extended tail is detected behind the pulsar, perhaps because the Mach number is not large enough or\nthe exposure time is too short. Our analysis of the PWN morphology suggests an anisotropic pulsar wind outflow, possibly\nincluding jets oriented along the direction of pulsar motion.\nTo establish the nature of the compact PWN unambiguously,\nproper motion measurements and a deeper Chandra observation are required.\nThe compact PWN is immersed in an extended emission\nof lower surface brightness. This extended emission is offset\nwith respect to the pulsar in the direction opposite to that of\nthe compact PWN (i.e. in the direction of the alleged proper\nmotion). If the extended emission is indeed powered by\nthe supersonically moving pulsar, then the radiating particles\ncould be supplied through the front jet of the compact PWN\nor brought by the northern part of the reverse SNR shock that\novertook the pulsar moving southward.\nThe spectrum of the pulsar can be described by a twocomponent BB+PL model. For reasonable nH values, the parameters of this model and the corresponding component luminosities resemble those of Vela-like pulsars.\nThe J1809 pulsar and its PWN are located in the vicinity of the unidentified extended TeV source HESS J1809\u2013\n193, which can be powered by ultrarelativistic electrons\naccelerated in the J1809 PWN. In addition to J1809, we\nfound another X-ray source, Ch1, within the central part of\n\n\f13\nHESS J1809, which might also be an unresolved pulsar/PWN.\nAlthough the true nature of Ch1 remains elusive, we cannot\nrule out the possibility that Ch1 is an alternative X-ray counterpart of HESS J1809. Whatever of the two objects, J1809\nor Ch1, supply the relativistic electrons, the TeV emission is\nlikely produced by the ICS of either CMBR or IR photons\nfrom bright IRAS sources (Source A or Source B) projected\nnear HESS J1809.\nOur thanks are due to Divas Sanwal, PI of the Chandra observation, who participated in the initial analysis of the Chandra data.
