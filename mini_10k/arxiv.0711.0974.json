restructure its visitor program and to\ncreate a \"CERN Theory Institute\", where 1-3 month long specific programs can take place.\nThe first such Institute was held from 14 May to 10 June 2007, focussing on \"Heavy Ion\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n9\n\nCollisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\". It brought together close to 100 scientists\nworking on the theory of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The aim of this workshop was\nto review and document the status of expectations and predictions for the heavy ion program\nat the Large Hadron Collider LHC before its start. LHC will explore heavy ion collisions at\n\u223c 30 times higher center of mass energy than explored previously at the Relativistic Heavy Ion\nCollider RHIC. So, on the one hand, the charge of this workshop provided a natural forum for\nthe exchange of the most recent ideas, and allowed to monitor how the understanding of heavy\nion collisions has evolved in recent years with the data from RHIC, and with the preparation of\nthe LHC experimental program. On the other hand, the workshop aimed at a documentation\nwhich helps to distinguish pre- from post-dictions. An analogous documentation of the \"Last\nCall for Predictions\" [1] was prepared prior to the start of the heavy-ion program at the\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider RHIC, and it proved useful in the subsequent discussion and\ninterpretation of RHIC data. The present write-up is the documentation of predictions for the\nLHC heavy ion program, received or presented during the CERN TH Institute. The set-up of\nthe CERN TH Institute allowed us to aim for the wide-most coverage of predictions. There\nwere more than 100 presentations and discussions during the workshop. Moreover, those\nunable to attend could still participate by submitting predictions in written form during the\nworkshop. This followed the spirit that everybody interested in making a prediction had the\nright to be heard.\nTo arrive at a concise document, we required that each prediction should be summarized\non at most two pages, and that predictions should be presented, whenever possible, in figures\nwhich display measurable quantities. Full model descriptions were not accepted - the authors\nwere encouraged to indicate the relevant references for the interested reader. Participants\nhad the possibility to submit multiple contributions on different topics, but it was part of\nthe subsequent editing process to ensure that predictions on neighboring topics were merged\nwherever possible. The contributions summarized here are organized in several sections,\n- though some of them contain material related with more than one section -, roughly by\ngoing from low transverse momentum to high transverse momentum and from abundant to\nrare measurements. In the low transverse momentum regime, we start with predictions on\nmultiplicity distributions, azimuthal asymmetries in particle production and hadronic flavor\nobservables, followed by correlation and fluctuation measurements. The contributions on\nhard probes at the LHC start with predictions for single inclusive high transverse momentum\nspectra, and jets, followed by heavy quark and quarkonium measurements, leptonic probes\nand photons. A final section \"Others\" encompasses those predictions which do not fall\nnaturally within one of the above-mentioned categories, or discuss the more speculative\nphenomena that may be explored at the LHC.\nWe would like to end this Preface by thanking the TH Unit at CERN for its generous\nsupport of this workshop. Special thanks go to Elena Gianolio, Michelle Mazerand, Nanie\nPerrin and Jeanne Rostant, whose help and patience was invaluable.\nN\u00e9stor Armesto\nNicolas Borghini\nSangyong Jeon\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n10\n\nUrs Achim Wiedemann\n1. Multiplicities and multiplicity distributions\n1.1. Multiplicity distributions in rapidity for Pb-Pb and p-Pb central collisions from a simple\nmodel\nS. Abreu, J. Dias de Deus and J. G. Milhano\nThe simple model [2] for the distribution of rapidity extended objects (longitudinal\nglasma colour fields or coloured strings) created in a heavy ion collision combines the\ngeneration of lower centre-of-mass rapidity objects from higher rapidity ones with asymptotic\nsaturation in the form of the well known logistic equation for population dynamics\n1\n\u2202\u03c1\n= (\u03c1 \u2212 A\u03c12 ) ,\n(1)\n\u2202(\u2212\u2206) \u03b4\nwhere \u03c1 \u2261 \u03c1(\u2206, Y) is the particle density, Y is the beam rapidity, and \u2206 \u2261 |y| \u2212 Y.

The bulk of the spectra (pT . 5 GeV/c) in\ncentral Pb-Pb at the LHC is computed with a hydrodynamical model \u2013 successfully tested\nat RHIC [10] \u2013 using an initial entropy density extrapolated empirically from the hadron\n\u221a\nmultiplicities measured at RHIC: dNch /d\u03b7|\u03b7=0 /(0.5 Npart ) \u2248 0.75 ln( sNN /1.5) [11]. Above\npT \u2248 3 GeV/c, additional hadron production from (mini)jet fragmentation is computed from\ncollinearly factorized pQCD cross sections at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy [12]. We\nuse recent parton distribution functions (PDF) [13] and fragmentation functions (FF) [14],\nmodified respectively to account for initial-state shadowing [15] and final-state parton energy\nloss [16].\nWe use cylindrically symmetric boost-invariant 2+1-D relativistic hydrodynamics, fixing the initial conditions for Pb-Pb at b = 0 fm and employing a simple Glauber prescription\nto obtain the corresponding source profiles at all other centralities [10].

We follow the evolution of the system\nby solving the equations of ideal hydrodynamics including the current conservation for netbaryon number (the system is almost baryon-free, \u03bcB \u2248 5 MeV). For temperatures above\n(below) T crit \u2248 170 MeV the system is described with a QGP (hadron gas) equation of state\n(EoS). The QGP EoS \u2013 obtained from a parametrization to recent lattice QCD results \u2013 is\nMaxwell connected to the hadron resonance gas phase assuming a first-order phase transition.\nAs done for RHIC energies, we chemically freeze-out the system (i.e. fix the hadron ratios) at\nT crit . Final state hadron spectra are obtained with the Cooper-Frye prescription at T fo \u2248 120\nMeV followed by decays of unstable resonances using the known branching ratios. Details\ncan be found at [10].\nOur NLO pQCD predictions are obtained with the code of ref. [12] with all scales set to\n\u03bc = pT . Pb-Pb yields are obtained scaling the NLO cross-sections by the number of incoherent\nnucleon-nucleon collisions for each centrality class given by a Glauber model (Ncoll = 1670,\n12.9 for 0-10%-central and 60-90%-peripheral). Nuclear (isospin and shadowing) corrections of the CTEQ6.5M PDFs [13] are introduced using the NLO nDSg parametrization [15].\nFinal-state energy loss in the hot and dense medium is accounted for by modifying the AKK\nFFs [14] with BDMPS quenching weights as described in [16]. The BDMPS medium-induced\ngluon spectrum depends on a single scale \u03c9c = hq\u0302i L2 , related to the transport coefficient and\nlength of the medium. We use \u03c9c \u2248 50 GeV, from the expected energy dependence of the\nquenching parameter and the measured \u03c9c \u2248 20 GeV at RHIC [16]. The inclusive hadron\nspectra in central Pb-Pb are suppressed by up to a factor \u223c10 (2), RPbPb \u2248 0.1 (0.5), at pT =\n10 (100) GeV/c.\nOur predictions for the identified hadron spectra in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.5 TeV are shown\nin Figure 4. The hydrodynamical contribution dominates over the (quenched) pQCD one up to\npT \u2248 4 (1.5) GeV/c in central (peripheral) Pb-Pb. As expected, the hydro-pQCD pT crossing\npoint increases with the hadron mass. In the absence of recombination effects (not included\nhere), bulk protons may be boosted up to pT \u2248 5 GeV/c in central Pb-Pb at the LHC.\n1.4.

In Fig. 5 we show the\nresults of Eq.

We have also made predictions for baseline\ncold-matter nuclear effects in lead-lead collisions at the same energy.\n\n1.5.1. Introduction The system formed in nucleus-nucles (AA) collisions at LHC will\nprovide further insight into the dynamics of the deconfined state of nuclear matter. There\nare also interesting effects anticipated for the initial state of the incoming nuclei related to\nshadowing of nuclear parton distributions and the space-time picture of the interaction. These\nshould be studied in the more \"clean\" environment of a proton-nucleus collision. The initialstate effects constitute a baseline for calculation of the density of particles at all rapidities\nand affect therefore also high-p\u22a5 particle suppression and jet quenching, as well as the total\nmultiplicity.\nBoth soft and relatively high-p\u22a5 , p\u22a5 < 10 GeV/c, particle production in pA at LHC\nenergies probe the low-x gluon distribution of the target nucleus at moderate scales, Q2 \u223c p2\u22a5 ,\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n17\n\nFigure 6: RCP versus pt , Eq. (9), in dAu collisions at RHIC compared to experimental\ndata (upper and middle plots), and in pPb collisions at the LHC (lower plot), for different\npseudorapidities and centrality classes: central to peripheral (lower curves) and semicentral\nto peripheral (upper curves). The bands reflect the uncertainty in the definition of the centrality\nclass.\nand is therefore mainly influenced by nuclear shadowing. In the Glauber-Gribov theory [21],\nshadowing at low-x is related to diffractive structure functions of the nucleon, which are\nstudied at HERA. The space-time picture of the interaction is altered from a longitudinally\nordered rescattering at low energies, to a coherent interaction of the constituents of the\nincoming wave-functions at high energy. Shadowing affects both soft and hard processes.\nCalculation of gluon shadowing was performed in our recent paper [22], where Gribov\napproach for the calculation of nuclear structure functions was used. The Schwimmer model\nwas used to account for higher-order rescatterings. The gluon diffractive distributions are\ntaken from the most recent experimental parameterizations [23].\n1.5.2. Particle production at LHC Shadowing will lead to a suppression both at mid- and\n\u221a\nforward rapidities in p+Pb collisions at s = 5.5 TeV as seen in Fig. 7. We have plotted the\ncurves for two distinct kinematical scenarios of particle production; one-jet kinematics which\nmay be well motivated for particle production at p\u22a5 < 2 GeV/c and two-jet kinematics that\napply for high-p\u22a5 particle producion. The uncertainty in the curves is due to uncertainty in\nthe parameterization of gluon diffractive distribution functions. Cronin effect is not included\nin the curves of Fig. 7. We estimate it to be a 10% effect at these energies.\n\n\fRpA\n\nHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n18\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\nOne-jet kinematics\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\nTwo-jet kinematics\n\ny=0\ny=2\ny=4\ny=6\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\ny=0\ny=2\ny=4\ny=6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18 20\npT [GeV/c]\n\nFigure 7: Shadowing as a function of transverse for p+Pb collisions at\n\n\u221a\n\ns = 5.5 TeV.\n\nIn Fig. 8 we present the suppresion due to cold-nuclear effects in Pb+Pb collisions at\ns = 5.5 TeV as a function of centrality (top) and rapidity (bottom).

In the framework of HIJING/BB\u0304 v2.0 model, the new algorithm for junction antijunction JJ\u0304 loops provide a possible explanation for baryon/meson anomaly. The SCF effects\nas implemented within our model gives a better description of this anomaly. At LHC energies,\ndue to higher initial energy density (or temperature) we expect an increase of the mean value\nof the string tension (\u03ba) [27].\nThe day 1 measurements at the LHC will include results on multiplicity distributions with\nimportant consequences for our understanding of matter produced in the collisions [28], [29].\nFrom our model calculations one expects dNch\nPbPb /d\u03b7 \u2248 3500 at \u03b7 = 0 in central (0-5 %) Pb\n+Pb collision. This correspond to \u2248 17.5 produced charged hadrons per participant pair.\nThese values are higher than those obtained by requiring that both limiting fragmentation and\n\n\fR (Pb+Pb)\n\nHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n0.9\n\npT = 1.5 GeV/c\n\n0.8\n\ns = 5500 GeV\n\n19\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\ny* = 0\n\ny* = 3\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\nGG one-jet\nGG two-jet\n\n0.2\n0.1\n2\n\n4\n\nRPb+Pb\n\n0\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18 20\nb [fm]\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18 20\nb [fm]\n\n0.9\n\nGG one-jet\nGG two-jet\n\n0.8\n\np = 1.5 GeV/c\nT\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\nY\n\nFigure 8: Shadowing as a function of centrality (top) and rapidity (bottom) for Pb+Pb\n\u221a\ncollisions at s = 5.5 TeV.\nthe trapezoidal shape of the pseudo-rapidity distribution persist at the LHC [29]. Our model\npredicts a characteristic violations of the apparently universal trend, seen up to maximum\nRHIC energy. In contrast saturation models [5] offer a justification for the predicted very\n\u221a\nweak sNN dependence of event multiplicity.\nFigure 9 presents predictions for pT spectra at midrapidity and NMF Rch\nof total\n\u221a PbPb\ninclusive charged hadrons for central (0-5%) Pb+Pb and p + p collisions at sNN = 5.5 TeV.\n0\nThe predicted NMF R\u03c0PbPb of neutral pions is also presented. From our model calculations\nwe conclude that baryon/meson anomaly, will persist at the LHC with a slight increase for\nincreasing strength of the chromoelectric field (\u03ba = ee f f E). A somewhat higher sensitivity to\n\u03ba is obtained for NMF of identified particles [27].\nThe net-baryon rapidity distribution measured at RHIC is both qualitatively and\nquantitatively very different from those at lower energies indicating that a significantly\ndifferent system is formed near mid rapidity [30]. Fig. 10 (left panel) presents the energy\ndependence of net-baryon at mid-rapidity per participant pair. Shown are the results for central\n(0-5%) Au+Au collisions, which indicate a net decrease with increasing energy. This picture,\ncorroborated with an increase of the ratio p\u0304/p to \u2248 1 suggests that the reaction at the LHC\nis more transparent in contrast to the situation at lower energy.

Similar values (open squares) are obtained within\npQCD+hydro model [31]. However, this model predicts (Fig. 15 from ref. [31]) much steeper\nslopes of charged hadron pT spectra.\n\nFigure 10: Left: HIJING/BB\u0304 v2.0 predictions for net-baryon (per participant pair) at mid\u221a\nrapidity as function of sNN . Right: Average rapidity loss versus beam rapidity. The data\nand dashed line extrapolation are from ref. [30] and from BRAHMS [32].\nIn our model the main mechanisms for baryon production are quark di-quark (q \u2212 qq)\nstrings fragmentation and JJ\u0304 loops in which baryons are produced approximatively in pairs.\nThe energy dependence is \u221d (s/s0 )\u22121/4+\u2206/2 similar with those predicted in ref. [25] (eq. 11)\nwith the assumption that JJ\u0304 is a dominant mechanisms. This dependence is obtained if we\nchoose for the parameters: s0 = 1 GeV2 the usual parameter of Regge theory, \u03b1(0) = 1/2\nthe reggeon (M0J ) intercept and \u03b1P (0) = 1 + \u2206 (where \u2206 \u2248 0.01) for the pomeron intercept. If\nconfirmed, the measurements at LHC energies will help us to determine better these values.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n21\n\nIn contrast, results from HIJING/BB\u0304 v1.10 model [26] (star symbol) give a slow energy\ndependence with a higher pomeron intercept \u03b1P (0) = 1 + 0.08 and over-estimate the stopping\nin the entire energy region.\nBaryon conservation in the reactions can be used to predict rapidity loss and the energy\nloss per baryon. The results are illustrated in Fig. 10 (right panel) for average rapidity loss\n< \u03b4y > defined as in ref. [24]. The predicted values for RHIC and LHC energies, clearly depart\nfrom the linear extrapolation for constant relative rapidity loss [30], which seems to be valid\n\u221a\nonly at lower energies ( sNN \u2264 20 GeV).\n1.7. Investigating the extended geometric scaling region at LHC with polarized and\nunpolarized final states\nD. Boer, A. Utermann and E. Wessels\nWe present predictions for charged hadron production and \u039b polarization in p -p and p -Pb\ncollisions at the LHC using the saturation inspired DHJ model for the dipole cross section in the\nextended geometric scaling region.\n\nAt high energy, scattering of a particle off a nucleus can be described in terms of a\ncolour dipole scattering off small-x partons, predominantly gluons, in the nucleus. At very\nhigh energy (small x), the dipole amplitude starts to evolve nonlinearly with x, leading to\nsaturation of the density of these small-x gluons. The scale associated with this nonlinearity,\nthe saturation scale Q s (x), grows exponentially with log(1/x).\nThe nonlinear evolution of the dipole amplitude is expected to be characterized by\ngeometric scaling, which means that the dipole amplitude depends only on the combination\nrt2 Q2s (x), instead of on rt2 and x independently. Moreover, the scaling behaviour is expected to\nhold approximately in the so-called extended geometric scaling (EGS) region between Q2s (x)\nand Q2gs (x) \u223c Q4s (x)/\u039b2 .\nThe small-x DIS data from HERA, which show geometric scaling, were successfully\ndescribed by the GBW model [33]. To describe the RHIC data on hadron production in d -Au\nin the EGS region a modification of the GBW model was proposed by Dumitru, Hayashigaki\nand Jalilian-Marian (DHJ), incorporating scaling violations in terms of a function \u03b3+ [34].\nThis DHJ model also describes p -p data at forward rapidities [35].\n1.7.1. DHJ model prediction for charged hadron production Using the DHJ model we can\nmake a prediction for the pt -spectrum of charged hadron production in both p -Pb and p -p\n\u221a\n\u221a\ncollisions at the LHC, at respectively s = 8.8 TeV and s = 14 TeV. Figure 11a shows the\nminimum bias invariant yield for an observed hadron rapidity of yh = 2 in the centre of mass\nframe, which for 1 GeV . pt . 10 GeV predominantly probes the EGS region. We note that\nat this rapidity the result is not sensitive to details of the DHJ model in the saturation region\nrt2 > 1/Q2s . Further, from [34] we expect that pt -independent K-factors are needed to fix the\n+\n\nWe note that at central rapidities we cannot reproduce exactly the results of [34] for large pt . Therefore, a\nmodification of the model may be needed to describe all RHIC data.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n22\n\nnormalization. We conclude that the LHC data on hadron production in both p -Pb and p -p\ncollisions will provide valuable data to further study the dipole scattering amplitude near the\nonset of saturation, particularly the behaviour of the function \u03b3, which is discussed in e.g. [36].\n1.7.2. DHJ model prediction for \u039b polarization Another interesting small-x observable is\nthe polarization of \u039b hyperons produced in p -A collisions, P\u039b . This polarization, oriented\ntransversely to the production plane, was shown to essentially probe the derivative of the\ndipole scattering amplitude, hence displaying a peak around Q s when described in the\nMcLerran-Venugopalan model [37]. If this feature persists when x-evolution of the dipole\nscattering amplitude is taken into account, P\u039b would be a valuable probe of saturation effects.\nUsing the DHJ model for the x-evolution of the scattering amplitude, we find that P\u039b displays\nsimilar behaviour as in the MV model. This is depicted for fixed \u039b rapidities of 2 and 4\nin figure 11b. The position of the peak scales with the average value of the saturation scale\nhQ s (x)i. In the plotted region, the peak is located roughly at hQ s (x)i/2.\nThe figure also shows that, like in the MV model, in the DHJ model |P\u039b | scales\n\u221a\napproximately linearly with xF , which means that at the LHC it is very small due to s\nbeing very large: rapidities around 6 are required for P\u039b to be on the 1% level, although there\nis a considerable model uncertainty in the normalization.\nWe conclude that the polarization of \u039b particles in p -Pb collisions is an interesting probe\nof hQ s (x)i, but is probably of measurable size only at very forward rapidities.\n0\n\n0\n\n1\u00d710\n\n-0.001\n\n-2\n\n1\u00d710\n\n-0.002\n-3\n\n1\u00d710\n\nP\u039b\n\nd3 N\n[(GeV/c)\u22122 ]\ndy d2 pT\n\np-P b, 8.8 TeV, yh = 2\np-P b, 8.8 TeV, yh = 4\n\np-p, 14 TeV, yh = 2\np-P b, 8.8 TeV, yh = 2\n\n-1\n\n1\u00d710\n\n-0.003\n-4\n\n1\u00d710\n\n-0.004\n\n-5\n\n1\u00d710\n\n-6\n\n1\u00d710 1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\npT [GeV/c]\n\n10\n\n-0.005\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n2.5\n\npT [GeV/c]\n\nFigure 11: a.

To apply DPMJET\u2013III to central collisions of heavy nuclei, the percolation\nand fusion of the hadronic chains had to be implemented [41].\nIn figures 12 and 13 we apply this model to minimum bias and central collisions of heavy\nnuclei at the LHC and at RHIC. We find an excellent agreement to RHIC data on inclusive\ndistributions.\nThe behaviour of the inclusive hadron production becomes particular simple if we plot\nN\nit in the form d\u03b7dNcm / part\n2 . Npart is the number of participants in the AA collisions. In figure 14\nwe plot this quantity as function of Npart and as function of E cm , in both plots we find a rather\nsimple behaviour.\nThe limiting fragmentation hypothesis was proposed in 1969 by Benecke et al [42].\nN\nIf we apply it to nuclear collisions we have to plot d\u03b7dNcm / part\n2 as function of \u03b7cm \u2212 ybeam . In\nfigure 15 we plot central and less central Au-Au collisions at RHIC and LHC energies in this\nform. We find that DPMJET-III shows in the fragmentation region only small deviations from\nlimiting fragmentation.\n1.9.

These trends allow us to \"predict\", with high precision, several\nimportant results which will be seen in pp and PbPb collisions at LHC.\nSuch predictions are valuable from a practical point of view. More important, if they turn\nout to be correct, and the trends seen to date are not some accidental consequence of averaging\nover many species and momenta, the observed trends must be telling us something profound\nabout how QCD (most likely how the vacuum) determines particle production. At a minimum,\nif the current belief is correct that the intermediate state between the instant of collision and\nfinal free-streaming of the produced particles is very different in e+ e\u2212 and AA colisions, or\nfor that matter, in pp collisions, AA collisions below SPS energies and AA collisions at the\ntop RHIC energy, the global characteristics of multiparticle productions must be insensitive\nto the intermediate state. One consequence is that no successful prediction of any selected set\nof global properties can be used as evidence that a particular model correctly describes the\nintermediate state.\nOn the other hand, if these \"predictions\" turn out to be false, it will be a strong indicator\nof the onset of some new physics at LHC.\nSo what are these universal simple trends?\nWe find [43, 44], as a first approximation, that\n(i) The global distributions of charged particles factorize into an energy dependent part and\na geometry, or incident system, dependent part.\n(ii) At a given energy, in pA and AA the distributions do depend in detail on the colliding\nsystems or geometry (eg. impact parameter). However the total number of produced\nparticles is simply proportional to the total number of participants N part (or wounded\nnucleons, in the language of Bialas and Czyz). [Note: there is a systematic difference in\nthe constant of proportionality in pA and AA, that can be attributed to the leading particle\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n26\n\neffect in pp collisions]\n(iii) The total charged particle density dN/d\u03b7 (where \u03b7 is the pseudorapidity), and the directed\nand elliptic flow parameters \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 satisfy extended longitudinal scaling. Furthermore,\nover most of its range the \"limiting curve\" is linear.\n(iv) The mid-rapidity (in the cm system) particle density dN\nd\u03b7 |y=0 and the elliptic flow\n\u221a\nparameter \u03bd2 both increase linearly with ln s. It is not clear if this is the origin or\nconsequence of item (iii) above. [Note: for elliptic flow, (iii) and (iv) are directly related\nonly if we postulate that at all energies there is a \"pedestal\" in the value of \u03bd2 , i.e. there\nis a part of the source of flow that is independent of energy]\nIn the figures 16, 17 and 18 we use the above observed trends at lower energies to \"predict\"\nLHC results. A more detailed version of this work will be submitted to Acta Physica Polonica.\n\n1.10. Multiplicities and J/\u03c8 suppression at LHC energies\nA. Capella and E. G. Ferreiro\nWe present our predictions on multiplicities and J/\u03c8 suppression at LHC energies. Our results\ntake into account shadowing effects in the initial state and final state interactions with the hot medium.\nWe obtain 1800 charged particles at LHC and the J/\u03c8 suppression increases by a factor 5 to 6 compared\nto RHIC.\n\n1.10.1. Multiplicities with shadowing corrections At high energy, different mechanisms\nin the initial state -shadowing-, that lower the total multiplicity, have to be taken into\naccount. The shadowing makes the nuclear structure functions in nuclei different from the\nsuperposition of those of their constituents nucleons. Its effect increases with decreasing x\nand decreases with increasing Q2 . We have included a dynamical, non linear of shadowing\n[49], controlled by triple pomeron diagrams. It is determined in terms of the diffractive\ncross sections. Our results for charged particles multiplicities at RHIC and LHC energies\nare presented in Fig. 19. In absence of shadowing we obtain a maximal multiplicity,\ndNAA /dy = A4/3 . With shadowing corrections the multiplicity behaves as dNAA /dy = A\u03b1 ,\nwith \u03b1 = 1.13 at RHIC and \u03b1 = 1.1 at LHC.\n\n1.10.2. J/\u03c8 suppression An anomalous J/\u03c8 suppression -that clearly exceeds the one\nexpected from nuclear absorption- has been found in PbPb collisions at SPS. Such a\nphenomenon was predicted by Matsui and Satz as a consequence of deconfinement in a dense\nmedium. It can also be described as a result of final state interaction of the cc pair with\nthe dense medium produced in the collision: comovers interaction [50].

Zhang\nThe AMPT model [52] is a hybrid model that uses the HIJING model [53] to generate the\ninitial conditions, the ZPC [54] for modeling the partonic scatterings, and the ART model [55]\nfor treating hadronic scatterings. In the default version [56], the initial conditions are strings\nand minijets from the HIJING model and particle production is based on the Lund string\nfragmentation, while in the string melting version [57], the initial conditions are valence\nquarks and antiquarks from hadrons produced in the HIJING model and hadronization is\ndescribed by a coordinate-space coalescence model. Using the AMPT model, we predict in\nthe following the hadron rapidity and transverse momentum distributions, the elliptic flows\nof both light and heavy hadrons, the two-pion and two-kaon correlation functions in Pb+Pb\n\u221a\ncollisions at center-of-mass energy of sNN = 5.5 TeV at LHC [58].\nShown in the left window of Fig. 21 are the charged hadron pseudorapidity distribution\nand the rapidity distributions of identified hadrons obtained with (lines with circles) and\nwithout (solid lines) nuclear shadowing of nucleon parton distribution functions. Compared\nto results from the AMPT model for RHIC [59], the distributions at LHC are significantly\nwider and higher. For mid-pseudorapidity charged hadrons, the distribution shows a clear\nplateau structure with a value of about 4500 and 2500, respectively, without and with nuclear\nshadowing. The latter is more than a factor of three higher than that at RHIC. The transverse\nmomentum spectra of identified midrapidity hadrons are shown in the right window of Fig. 21\nby lines with circles. The inverse slope parameters, particularly for kaons and protons with\ntransverse momenta below 0.5 GeV/c and 1 GeV/c, respectively, are larger than those at RHIC\n(solid lines) as a result of stronger final-state rescatterings at LHC than at RHIC. Similar to\nthat observed at RHIC, the proton spectrum is below that of pions at low transverse momenta,\nbut they become comparable at about 2 GeV/c.\nHadron elliptic flows based on a parton scattering cross section of 10 mb, which is needed\nto describe observed hadron elliptic flows at RHIC [57], are shown in Fig. 22. The left window\ngives the elliptic flows of light and heavy quarks as functions of their transverse momenta, and\nthey display the expected mass ordering at low transverse momenta, i.e., the elliptic flow is\nsmaller for quarks with larger masses.

In both\ncollisions, radii of the emission source for pions are larger than those for kaons. The smaller\nlambda parameter for pions than for kaons is due to the large halo in the pion emission source\nfrom decays of omega mesons. Also, the emission source is non-Gaussian and shifted in the\ndirection of pion or kaon transverse momentum.\n1.12. Multiplicity distributions and percolation of strings\nJ. Dias de Deus and C. Pajares\nIn the framework of percolations of strings the rapidity distributions for central AA collisions are\nshown for SPS, RHIC and LHC energies. The obtained value for LHC is lower than the one predicted\nfor the rest of models but larger than the linear energy extrapolation from SPS and RHIC.\n\nMultiparticle production is currently described in terms of color strings stretched\nbetween the partons of the projectile and the target these color strings may be viewed as\nsmall areas in the transverse space \u03c0r02 , r0 \u2243 0.2 \u2212 0.3 fm, filled with color field created\nby the colliding partons. Particles are produced via emision of qq\u0304 pairs in this field. With\ngrowing energy and/or atomic number of colliding nuclei, the number of strings grows, and\nthey start to overlap, forming clusters, very much similar to disks in the two dimensional\npercolation theory. At a certain critical density a macroscopical cluster appears that marks the\npercolation phase transition [65]. A cluster behaves as a single string with a higher color field\n~ n corresponding to the vectorial sum of the color changes of each individual Q\n~ 1 string. The\nQ\nP\n~ 1 , and the individual string\n~n = Q\nresulting color field covers the area S n of the cluster. As Q\n~ 1i * Q\n~1 j\ncolors may be oriented in an arbitrary manner respective to one another, the average Q\n~ 2n = nQ\n~ 2.\nis zero and Q\n1\nIn this way, the multiplicity \u03bcn and the average p2T of particles < p2T >n produced by a\ncluster of n strings, are given by\nr\nr\nnS n\nnS 1 2\n2\n\u03bc1 ; hpT in =\nhp i1\n(13)\n\u03bcn =\nS1\nSn T\n\nwhere \u03bc1 and hp2T i1 are the mean multiplicity and the mean transverse momentum of particles\nproduced by a simple string with a transverse area S 1 = \u03c0r02 .\nEquation (13) is the main tool of our calculations. In order to compute the multiplicities\nwe generate strings according to the quark gluon string model and using a Monte Carlo code.\nEach string is produced at an identified impact parameter. From this, knowing the transverse\narea of each string, we identify all the clusters formed is each collision and subsequently\ncompute for each of them the rapidity multiplicity spectrum.\nIn figure 24 is shown the results, (see reference [3] for details) for central Au-Au\n\u221a\ncollisions at different energies, including the curve for sNN = 5.5 TeV. The value at\nmidrapidity 8.5 is similar to other computations in the same framework (7.3 [66], 8.6 [67]).\nThis strong reduction of the multiplicities relative to simple multicollision models, due to the\ninteraction of strings, was anticipated 12 years ago [68].

The linear log of energy extrapolation of the SPS and RHIC values gives a lower value\nof around 6.5.\nAt SPS and RHIC has been observed an aproximated limiting fragmentation scaling,\nwhich is well reproduced in our approach. A clear breaking of this scaling is predicted at\nLHC.\n1.13. Shear Viscosity to Entropy within a Parton Cascade\nA. El, C. Greiner and Z. Xu\nThe shear viscosity is calculated by means of the perturbative kinetic partonic cascade BAMPS\nwith CGC initial conditons for various saturation momentum scale Q s . \u03b7/s \u2248 0.15 stays approximately\nconstant when going from RHIC to LHC.\n\nThe measured momentum anisotropy parameter v2 at RHIC energy can be well\nunderstood if the expanding quark-gluon matter is assumed to be described by ideal\nhydrodynamics. This suggests that a strongly interacting and locally thermalized state of\nmatter has been created which behaves almost like a perfect fluid. Since the initial situation of\nthe quark-gluon system is far from thermal equilibrium, it is important to understand how and\nwhich microscopic partonic interactions can thermalize the system within a short timescale\nand can be responsible as well for its (nearly) ideal hydrodynamical behaviour. Furthermore\none would like to know the transport properties of the QGP, most prominently the shear\nviscosity.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n0.7\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n0.25\n\n)\n1/3\n\n1500\n1000\n500\n\n0.5\n<pz2/E2>\n\n(GeV*fm\n\n1/3\n\nQS=2 GeV\nQS=3 GeV\nQS=4 GeV\n\nT*t\n\ndN/d\u03b7|cenral bin\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0\n\nQS=2 GeV\nQS=3 GeV\nQS=4 GeV\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nt (fm/c)\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFigure 25: Time evolution of\nmomentum anisotropy (right).\n\n0.2\n0.15\nQS=2 GeV\nfit, trel=0.85\nQS=3 GeV\nfit, trel=0.52\nQS=4 GeV\nfit, trel=0.42\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0\n\nMomentum Isotropy <pz2/E2>\n\nT*t1/3\n\ndN/d\u03b7 |CENTRAL\n3500\n\n2500\n\n35\n\n1\n\n1.5\nt (fm/c)\n\n2\n\n0.05\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n2.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n2\nt (fm/c)\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\ndN\nd\u03b7\n\n(left), of the effective temperature (middle) and of the\n\nA kinetic parton cascade (BAMPS) [69,70] has been developed with strictly perturbative\nQCD inspired processes including for the first time inelastic (\"Bremsstrahlung\") collisions\ngg \u2194 ggg. The multiparticle back reation channel is treated fully consistently by respecting\ndetailed balance within the same algorithm. In [70] it is demonstrated that the inelastic\nprocesses dominate the total transport collision rate and thus contribute much stronger\nto momentum isotropization then elastic ones. Within a default setting of minijet initial\nconditions, the overall build up of elliptic flow v2 can be reasonably described [71] (a more\ndedicated study is presently undertaken [72]).\nOne can thus expect to see thermalization of a QGP on a short time scale less than\n1 f m/c for LHC relevant initial conditions as can be seen in the evolution in time of the\ntemperature and the momentum isotropy depicted in Fig. 25. We apply Bjorken expanding\ngeometry in one dimension. For the initial condition a simple Color Glass Condensate\n(CGC) gluon distribution is assumed: The initial partons are described by the boost-invariant\nform of the distribution function f (x, p)|z=0 = \u03b1scNc \u03c41f \u03b4(pz ) \u0398(Q2s \u2212 p2T ) at a characteristic time\n\u03c40 = c/(\u03b1 s Nc Q s ).\nDue to 3 \u2192 2 collisions the particle number first decreases (see Fig. 25) [73]. This is in\ncontrast to the idealistic \"Bottom-Up\" scenario of thermalization, where an ongoing particle\nproduction in the soft sector (pT < \u03b1 s QS ) is predicted with a strong increase in the total\nparticle number. The present calculation show that the particle number roughly stays constant.\nFor the above simple CGC parametrization Q s = 2 GeV corresponds to RHIC energy whereas\nQ s \u2248 3 \u2212 4 GeV is expected for LHC.\nFor all energies a nearly ideal hydrodynamical behavior is observed after 0.5 f m/c\n(middle Fig. 25). The thermalization time lies in the same range when looking at the\nmomentum isotropy. It is of crucial importance to extract out of these simulations the\ntransport properties of QCD matter to quantify the dissipative properties of the fluid. Using\nstandard dissipative hydrodynamics in expanding geometry shear viscosity and ratio \u03b7s can\n\u0010\n\u0011\nbe calculated [73]: \u03b7 = 4\u03c4 T xx + T yy \u2212 2 * T zz and s = 4n \u2212 n * ln (\u03bb), where \u03bb denotes the gluon\nfugacity. As depicted in Fig. 26, the value \u03b7s \u2248 0.15 proves to be a universal number within\nthe BAMPS simulations, being nearly independent of QS .

Hadron multiplicities, pT spectra and net-baryon number in central Pb+Pb collisions\nat the LHC\nK. J. Eskola, H. Honkanen, H. Niemi, P. V. Ruuskanen and S. S. R\u00e4s\u00e4nen\nWe summarize here our recent LHC predictions [31], obtained in the framework of\nperturbative QCD (pQCD)+saturation+hydrodynamics (EKRT model for brief) [74]. This\nmodel has successfully predicted [74,75] the charged particle multiplicities in central Au+Au\n\u221a\ncollisions at different sNN , and it also describes the low-pT spectra of pions and kaons at\nRHIC quite well [31, 76].\nPrimary parton production in the EKRT model is computed from collinearly factorized\npQCD cross sections [77] by extending the calculation towards smaller pT until the abundant\ngluon production vertices overlap and gluon fusions [78] saturate the number of produced\npartons (gluons). The saturation scale is determined as p0 = psat from a saturation\n\u221a\n\u221a\ncondition [74] NAA (p0 , s) * \u03c0/p20 = c * \u03c0R2A , where NAA (p0 , s) is the average number of\npartons produced at |y| \u2264 0.5 and pT \u2265 p0 . With a constant c = 1 the framework is closed.\nFor central Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC psat \u2248 2 GeV. We obtain the initial conditions for\nthe cylindrically symmetric boost invariant (2+1)-dimensional hydrodynamical description\nby converting the computed transverse energy E T (psat ) and net-baryon number NB (psat ) into\ndensities \u01eb(r, \u03c40 ) and n B(r, \u03c40 ) using binary collision profiles and formation time \u03c40 = 1/psat .\nAssuming a fast thermalization at \u03c40 , and zero initial transverse fluid velocity, we proceed\nby solving the standard equations of ideal hydrodynamics including the current conservation\nequation for net-baryon number. In the Equation of State we assume an ideal gas of gluons\nand massless quarks (N f = 3), the QGP, with a bag constant B at T > T c , and a hadron\nresonance gas of all states with m < 2 GeV at T < T c . Taking B1/4 = 239 MeV leads to\nfirst-order transition with T c = 165 MeV.

Extensive\ncomparison [31,76] with RHIC data suggests a single decoupling temperature T dec = 150 MeV\nwhich is also used to calculate the predictions for the LHC. For details, see [31].\nOur predictions [31] for the LHC multiplicities, transverse energies and net-baryon\n\u221a\nnumber at y = \u03b7 = 0 for 5% most central Pb+Pb collisions at sNN = 5.5 TeV are summarized\nin table 2. Note that the predicted charged particle multiplicity dNch /d\u03b7 is 2570, i.e. only a\nthird of the initial ALICE design value (see also [75]). Whereas the multiplicity of initially\nproduced partons and observable hadrons are close to each other, the transverse energy is\nreduced by a factor as large as 3.4 in the evolution from initial state to final hadrons. Due to\nthis reduction the very high initial temperature, T 0 & 1 GeV, possibly observable through the\nemission of photons, need not lead to contradiction between predicted and observed E T .\nTable 2:\ndN tot\ndy\n\ndN tot\nd\u03b7\n\ndN ch\ndy\n\ndN ch\nd\u03b7\n\ndN B\ndy\n\ndE T\ndy\n\ndE T\nd\u03b7\n\ndN \u03c0\u00b1\ndy\n\ndN \u03c00\ndy\n\ndN K\u00b1\ndy\n\ndN p\ndy\n\ndN p\u0304\ndy\n\np/ p\u0304\n\n4730\n\n4240\n\n2850\n\n2570\n\n3.11\n\n4070\n\n3710\n\n1120\n\n1240\n\n214\n\n70.8\n\n69.6\n\n0.98\n\nOur prediction for the charged hadron pT spectrum is the lower limit of the red band\n(HYDRO, the width corresponding to T dec = 120 . . . 150 MeV) in the l.h.s. of figure 27 [31].\nThe corresponding pT distributions of \u03c0+ and K + are shown in the r.h.s. of the figure (solid\nlines).

Melting the Color Glass Condensate at the LHC\nH. Fujii, F. Gelis, A. Stasto and R. Venugopalan\nThe charged particle multiplicity in central AA collisions and the production of heavy flavors in\npA collisions at the LHC is predicted in the CGC framework.\n\n1.15.1. Introduction In the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework, fast (large x) partons\nare described as frozen light cone color sources while the soft (small x) partons are described\nas gauge fields. The distribution of the fast color sources and their evolution with rapidity is\ndescribed by the JIMWLK evolution equation; it is well approximated for large nuclei by the\nBalitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation. When two hadrons collide, a time dependent color field\nis produced that eventually decays into gluons [81]. When the projectile is dilute (e.g.,AA\ncollisions at forward rapidity or pA collisions), k\u22a5 factorization holds for gluon production,\nthereby simplifying computations. For quark production, k\u22a5 factorization breaks down and is\nrecovered only for large invariant masses and momenta.\n\ndN/d\u03b7/(0.5 Npart)\n\n1.15.2. Particle multiplicity in central AA collisions The k\u22a5 factorized cross-sections are\nconvolutions over \"dipole\" scattering amplitudes in the projectile and target. Initial conditions\nfor the BK evolution of these are specified at an initial x = x0 (chosen here to be x0 \u2248 10\u22122 ).\nIn this work [82], we consider two initial conditions, based respectively on the McLerranVenugopalan (MV) model or on the Golec-Biernat\u2013Wusthoff (GBW) model.We adjust the\n\u221a\nfree parameters to reproduce the limiting fragmentation curves measured at RHIC from s =\n\u221a\n20 GeV to s = 200 GeV. The value of \u03b1 s in the fixed coupling BK equation is tuned to\nobtain the observed rate of growth of the saturation scale.The rapidity distribution dN/dy\nis converted into the pseudo-rapidity distribution dN/d\u03b7 by asuming the produced particles\n\u221a\nhave m \u223c 200 MeV.

Heavy quark production in pA collisions The cross-section for the production of a\npair of heavy quarks [83] is the simplest process for which k\u22a5 -factorization breaks down [84]\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n39\n\nin pA collisions. This is due to the sensitivity of the cross-section to 3- and 4-point correlations\nin the nucleus. Integrating out the antiquark and convoluting with a fragmentation function,\none obtains the cross-section for open heavy flavor production, e.g., D mesons. Alternatively,\none can use the Color Evaporation Model to obtain the cross-section for quarkonia bound\nstates. The nuclear modification ratio is displayed in figure 29. The main difference at the\nLHC compared to RHIC energy is that this ratio is smaller than unity already at mid rapidity,\nand decreases further towards the proton fragmentation region.\n1.2\n1.4\n1.2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\ny = 0, 2, 4\n\n0.6\n\nRpA\n\nRpA\n\ny = 0, 2\n\nJ/\u03c8\nCharm\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\nRHIC\n\n0.2\n\nLHC\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n6\npT ( GeV/c )\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\ny\n\nFigure 29: Left: nuclear modification factor for D mesons as a function of p\u22a5 .

Triantafyllopoulos\nWe predict that the R pA ratio at the most forward rapidities to be measured at LHC should be\nstrongly suppressed, close to \"total shadowing\" (R pA \u2243 A\u22121/3 ), as a consequence of running coupling\neffects in the nonlinear QCD evolution.\n\nWe present predictions for the nuclear modification factor, or \"R pA ratio\", at forward\npseudorapidities (\u03b7 > 0) and relatively large transverse momenta (p\u22a5 ) for the produced\nparticles, in the kinematical range to be accessible at LHC. These predictions are based on\na previous, systematic, study of the R pA ratio within the Color Glass Condensate formalism\nwith running coupling [85]. The ratio can be approximated by\n1 \u03a6A (Y, p\u22a5 )\n,\n(14)\nR pA \u2243 1/3\nA \u03a6 p (Y, p\u22a5 )\n\u221a\nwhere Y = \u03b7 + ln s/p\u22a5 and \u03a6(Y, p\u22a5 ) is the unintegrated gluon distribution of the\ncorresponding target hadron at fixed impact parameter. When the energy increases one expects\nmore and more momentum modes of this distribution to saturate to a value of order 1/\u03b1 s, and\nthe corresponding saturation momentum reads\ns\nQ2 (Y0 )\n(15)\nQ2s (Y) = \u039b2 exp B(Y \u2212 Y0 ) + ln2 s 2 ,\n\u039b\nwith \u039b = 0.2 GeV, B = 2.25 and Y0 = 4. The initial condition for the nucleus and the\nproton are taken as Q2s (A, Y0 ) = 1.5 GeV2 and Q2s (p, Y0 ) = 0.25 GeV2 respectively, so that\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n40\n\nQ2s (A, Y0 ) = A1/3 Q2s (p, Y0 ) for A = 208. The functional form of this expression is motivated\nby the solution to the nonlinear QCD evolution equations with running coupling [86, 87],\nwhile the actual values of the numbers B and Y0 have been chosen in such a way to agree with\nthe HERA/RHIC phenomenology. As shown in Fig. 30, with increasing Y the two saturation\nmomenta approach to each other and clearly for sufficiently large Y, a nucleus will not be\nmore dense than a proton [87].\nQ2\n\nQ2s HA,YL\u0090Q2s Hp,YL\n\n30\n\nQ2g HA,YL\n\n6\nFixed \u0391s\n\n25\n\n5\n\nQ2g Hp,YL\n\n20\n4\n\n15\n\n3\n\n10\nRunning \u0391s\n\n2\n\nQ2s HA,YL\n\n5\nQ2s Hp,YL\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nY\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nY\n\nFigure 30: Left: The ratio of the saturation momenta. (Y = 12 corresponds to a pseudorapidity\n\u03b7 = 6 for the produced particles). Right: Geometric scaling windows.\nFor momenta p\u22a5 larger than Q s , the gluon distribution satisfies geometrical scaling [86,\n88], i.e. it is a function of only the combined variable p\u22a5 /Q s (Y):\n\" 2 #\u03b3\n!\np2\u22a5\nQ s (Y)\nln 2\n\u03a6(p\u22a5 , Y) \u221d\n+c ,\n(16)\np2\u22a5\nQ s (Y)\n\nwith \u03b3 = 0.63 and c = O(1). This holds within the scaling window Q s . p\u22a5 . Qg ,\nwhere ln Q2g (Y)/Q2s (Y) \u223c [ln Q2s (Y)/\u039b2 ]1/3 and for large Y this is proportional to Y 1/6 . The\ngeometrical scaling lines for a proton and a nucleus are shown in Fig. 30. Note that, since Qg is\nincreasing much faster than Q s , a common scaling window exists, at Q s (A, Y) . p\u22a5 . Qg (p, Y)\n(and for sufficiently large Y), where the gluon distributions for both the nucleus and the proton\nare described by Eq. (16).\nWithin this window, it is straightforward to calculate the R pA ratio. This is shown in\nFig. 31 for two values of pseudorapidity. The upper, dotted, line is the asymptotic prediction\nof a fixed-coupling scenario, in which the ratio Q2s (A, Y)/Q2s (p, Y) = const. = A1/3 , while the\nlowest, straight, curve is the line of total shadowing R pA = 1/A1/3 . Our prediction with running\ncoupling is the line in between and it is very close to total shadowing. This is clearly a\nconsequence of the fact that the proton and the nuclear saturation momenta approach each\nother with increasing energy.\nNote finally that in the present analysis we have neglected the effects of particle number\nfluctuations (or \"Pomeron loops\"). This is appropriate since Pomeron loops effects are\nsuppressed by the running of the coupling [89], and thus can be indeed ignored at all energies\nof phenomenological interest (in particular, at LHC).\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\nRpA\n0.5\n\n41\n\nRpA\n0.5\n@A lnHA1\u00903 LD-H1-\u0393L\u00903\n\n@A lnHA1\u00903 LD-H1-\u0393L\u00903\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\u0397=3\n\n\u0397=5\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n-1\u00903\n\nA\n\n0.1\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\nA-1\u00903\n\n0.1\n\n15\n\np2\u00a6\n\n14\n\n16\n\nFigure 31: The ratio R pA as a function of p2\u22a5 at\n\n18\n\n\u221a\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\np2\u00a6\n\ns = 8.8 TeV.\n\n1.17. LHC dNch /d\u03b7 and Nch from Universal Behaviors\nS. Jeon, V. Topor Pop and M. Bleicher\nRHIC dNch /d\u03b7 contains two universal curves, one for limiting fragmentation and one for the\ntransition region.

In reference [91], we have shown that in the RHIC\ndN/d\u03b7 (normalized to the number of colliding nucleon pairs) spectra at various energies, there\nare in fact two universal curves. This fact is not readily visible if one compares the dN/d\u03b7\nfrom different energies directly.

More\ninterestingly, there emerges another universal behavior beyond that point as shown in the right\npanel in Fig.1. In this panel, we have shifted dN/d\u03b7 vertically and horizontally to match the\nshoulder. The common straight line in d2 N/d\u03b72 in this region clearly show that the shoulder\nregion in dN/d\u03b7 is a quadratic function of \u03b7. Moreover the curvature of the quadratic function\nis independent of the colliding energy.

Nardi\nWe present the predictions for hadron multiplicities in pp, pA and AA collisions at the LHC\nbased on our approach to the Color Glass Condensate.\n\nWe expect that at LHC energies, the dynamics of soft and semi-hard interactions\nwill be dominated by parton saturation. In this short note we summarize our results for\nhadron multiplicities basing on the approach that we have developed and tested at RHIC\nenergies in recent years [7, 92\u201394]; a detailed description of our predictions for the LHC\nenergies can be found in reference [5]. In addition, we will briefly discuss the properties\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n43\n\nof non-linear evolution at high energies, and their implications; details will be presented\nelsewhere [95]. Our approach is based on the description of initial wave functions of\ncolliding hadrons and nuclei as sheets of Color Glass Condensate. We use a corresponding\nansatz for the unintegrated parton distributions, and compute the inclusive cross sections of\nparton production using k\u22a5 -factorization. The hadronization is implemented through the local\nparton-hadron duality \u2013 namely, we assume that the transformation of partons to hadrons is\na soft process which does not change significantly the angular (and thus pseudo-rapidity)\ndistribution of the produced particles. Because of these assumptions, we do not expect our\nresults be accurate for the transverse momentum distributions in AA collisions, but hope that\nour calculations (see figure 34a) will apply to the total multiplicities.\n\n12\n\nThis work\n\n(2/Npart)dNAA/d\u03b7\n\u03b7=0, Centrality 0-6 %\n\n10\n\n1\n\n8\n\n2\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n10\n\n(a)\n\n2\n\nW\n\n10\n\n3\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 34: (a) Charged hadron multiplicity in Pb-Pb collisions as a function of pseudo-rapidity\n\u221a\nat sNN = 5.5 TeV; also shown are predictions from other approaches (from [5]); (b) Energy\ndependence of charged hadron multiplicity per participant pair in central AA collisions for\ndifferent approaches to parton evolution (curves 1 and 2); also shown is the logarithmic fit,\ndashed curve (from [95]).\nWhile our approach has been extensively tested at RHIC, an extrapolation of our\ncalculations to the LHC energies requires a good theoretical control over the rapidity\ndependence of the saturation momentum Q s (y).

Recently, we have investigated the\nrole of longitudinal color fields in parton evolution at small x, and found that they lead to the\nfollowing dependence of the saturation momentum on rapidity [95]:\n\u0011\n\u0010\nQ2s (Y = Y0 ) exp 2 \u03b1\u03c0 S (Y \u2212 Y0 )\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0011,\n(17)\nQ2s (Y) =\n1 + B Q2s (Y = Y0 ) exp 2 \u03b1\u03c0S (Y \u2212 Y0 ) \u2212 1\n\nwhere B = 1/(32 \u03c02 ) (\u03c0 R2A /\u03b1S ); RA is the area of the nucleus, and \u03b1S is the strong coupling\nconstant.

At high energies,\nequation (17) predicts substantial slowing down of the evolution, which results in the decrease\nof hadron multiplicity as shown in figure 34b by the curve \"2\". In both cases, the growth of\nmultiplicity is much slower than predicted in the conventional \"soft plus hard\" models, see\nfigure 34. We thus expect that the LHC data on hadron multiplicities will greatly advance the\nunderstanding of QCD in the strong color field regime.\n1.19. CGC at LHC\nB. Kopeliovich and I. Schmidt\nData strongly indicate the localization of glue in hadrons within small spots. This leads to a small\ntransverse overlap of gluons in nuclei, i.e. to weak CGC effects. We predict a weak Cronin effect for\nLHC, not considerably altered by gluon shadowing.\n\nThere are many experimental evidences for the localization of the glue in hadrons within\nspots of small size, r0 \u2248 0.3 fm [96, 97]. Correspondingly, the mean transverse momentum\nof gluons in the proton should be rather large, about 700 MeV/c. One of the manifestation\nof this phenomenon is a weak Cronin enhancement for gluons. Indeed, the Cronin effect is\na result of the interplay between the primordial transverse momentum, hkT2 i, of the incoming\nparton and the additional momentum, \u2206hkT2 i, gained in the nucleus (broadening). The relative\nsignificance of the latter controls the magnitude of the Cronin enhancement. Apparently, the\nlarger the original hkT2 i is, the weaker is the Cronin effect. The pT -slope of the cross section\nalso matters: the steeper it is, the stronger is the nuclear enhancement.\nAlthough a rather strong Cronin effect was observed in fixed target experiments, the\nproduction of high-pT hadrons is dominated by scattering of valence quarks [98]. One can\naccess the gluons only at sufficiently high energies. Relying on the above consideration, a\n\u221a\nvery weak Cronin enhancement was predicted in [98] at sNN = 200 GeV, as is depicted in\nfigure 35. A several times stronger effect was predicted in [99]\u2217 , and a suppression, rather\nthan enhancement, was the expectation of the color glass condensate (CGC) model [100]. The\nlatest data from the PHENIX experiment at RHIC support the prediction of [98].\nAt LHC energies one can access quite small values of Bjorken x, such that the lifetime\nof gluonic fluctuations, tc \u2248 0.05/(xmN ) [101], becomes longer than the nuclear size. Then\none might expect coherence effects, in particular pronounced signatures of CGC. However,\nthe longitudinal overlap of gluons is not sufficient, since they also have to overlap in impact\nparameter, which is something problematic for small gluonic spots. The mean number of\n2\n2\ngluons overlapping with a given one in a heavy nucleus is, hni = 3\u03c0\n4 r0 hT A i = \u03c0r0 \u03c1 A RA = 0.3,\nand such a small overlap results in a quite weak CGC and gluon shadowing. The latter is\nconfirmed by the NLO analysis of nuclear structure functions performed in [15]. Missing this\nimportant observation, one could easily overestimate both the CGC and gluon shadowing.\nThus, we expect that the effects of CGC, both the Cronin enhancement and shadowing\n\u2217 The extremely strong gluon shadowing implemented into the HIJING model is ruled out by the recent NLO\nanalysis [15] of DIS data.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n45\n\n1.2\n1.1\n\nRA(pT)\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n0.9\n\n\u221as=200 GeV\n\n0.8\n1.2\n1.1\n1\n\u2212\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\n\u221as=5.5 TeV\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\npT (GeV/c)\nFigure 35: Nucleus-to-proton ratio for pion production versus pT .

Therefore in\nthis case the nucleus-to proton ratio is expected to approach unity from below at high pT .\n1.20. Fluctuation Effects on R pA at High Energy\nM. Kozlov, A. I. Shoshi and B.-W. Xiao\nWe discuss a new physical phenomenon for R pA in the fixed coupling case, the total gluon\nshadowing, which arises due to the effect of gluon number fluctuations.\n\nWe study the ratio of the unintegrated gluon distribution of a nucleus hA (k\u22a5 , Y) over the\nunintegrated gluon distribution of a proton h p (k\u22a5 , Y) scaled up by A1/3\nR pA =\n\nhA (k\u22a5 , Y)\n1\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nA 3 h p (k\u22a5 , Y)\n\nThis ratio is a measure of the number of particles produced in a proton-nucleus collision\nversus the number of particles in proton-proton collisions times the number of collisions. The\ntransverse momentum of gluons is denoted by k\u22a5 and the rapidity variable by Y.\nIn the geometric scaling region shown in Fig. 36a the small-x physics is reasonably\ndescribed by the BK-equation which emerges in the mean field approximation. Using the BKequation one finds in the geometric scaling regime in the fixed coupling case that the shape of\nthe unintegrated gluon distribution of the nucleus and proton as a function of k\u22a5 is preserved\n2 /Q2 (Y)),\nwith increasing Y, because of the geometric scaling behaviour h p,A (k\u22a5 , Y) = h p,A (k\u22a5\ns\nand therefore the leading contribution to the ratio R pA is k\u22a5 and Y independent, scaling with\nthe atomic number A as R pA = 1/A1/3(1\u2212\u03b30 ) , where \u03b30 = 0.6275 [87]. This means that gluons\ninside the nucleus and proton are somewhat shadowed since hA /h p = A\u03b30 /3 lies between total\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n46\n\n(hA /h p = 1) and zero (hA /h p = A1/3 ) gluon shadowing. The partial gluon shadowing comes\nfrom the anomalous behaviour of the unintegrated gluon distributions which stems from the\nBFKL evolution.\nWe have recently shown [102] that the behaviour of R pA as a function of k\u22a5 and Y in the\nfixed coupling case is completely changed because of the effects of gluon number fluctuations\nor Pomeron loops at high rapidity. According to [103] the influence of fluctuations on the\nunintegrated gluon distribution is as follows: Starting with an intial gluon distribution of the\nnucleus/proton at zero rapidity, the stochastic evolution generates an ensamble of distributions\nat rapidity Y, where the individual distributions seen by a probe typically have different\nsaturation momenta and correspond to different events in an experiment. To include gluon\nf luc.\nnumber fluctuations one has to average over all individual events, h p,A (k\u22a5 , Y) = hh p,A (k\u22a5 , Y)i,\nwith h p,A (k\u22a5 , Y) the distribution for a single event. The main consequence of fluctuations is\nthe replacement of the\n\u0010 geometric scaling by\u0011 a new scaling, the diffusive scaling [103, 104],\n2 /hQ (Y)i2 ))/[DY] . The diffusive scaling, see Fig. 36a, sets in\nhh p,A (k\u22a5 , Y)i = h p,A ln(k\u22a5\ns\nwhen the dispersion of the different events is large, \u03c32 = h\u03c1 s (Y)2 i \u2212 h\u03c1 s (Y)i2 = DY \u226b 1,\ni.e., Y \u226b YDS = 1/D, where \u03c1 s(Y) = ln(Q2s (Y)/k02 ) and D is the diffusion coefficient, and is\n2 /hQ (Y)i2 ) \u226a \u03b3 \u03c32 . The new scaling means that the shape\nvalid in the region \u03c3 \u226a ln(k\u22a5\ns\n0\nof the unintegrated gluon distribution of the nucleus/proton becomes flatter and flatter with\nincreasing rapidity Y, in contrast to the preserved shape in the geometric scaling regime. This\nis the reason why the ratio in the diffusive scaling regime [102]\nR pA (k\u22a5 , Y) \u2243\n\n1\n3\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1/3\n\n1\u2212 ln A 2\n\n\u0013\n\n\"\n\n2\nk\u22a5\nhQ s (A, Y)i2\n\n# ln A1/3\n2\n\u03c3\n\n(19)\n\n2\u03c3\nA\nyields total gluon shadowing, R pA = 1/A1/3 , at asymptotic rapidity Y (at fixed A). This result\nis universal since it does not depend on the initial conditions. Moreover the slope of R pA as a\nfunction of k\u22a5 descreases with increasing Y. The qualitative behaviour of R pA at fixed \u03b1 s due\nto fluctuation effects is shown in Fig. 36b.\nThe above effects of fluctuations on R pA are valid in the fixed coupling case and at very\nlarge energy. It isn't clear yet whether the energy at LHC is high enough for them to become\nimportant. Moreover, in the case where fluctuation effects are neglected but the coupling\nis allowed to run, a similar behaviour for R pA is obtained [85], including the total gluon\nshadowing. It remains for the future to be clarified how important fluctuation or running\ncoupling effects are at given energy windows, e.g., at LHC energy.\n\n1.21.

A special feature is a careful treatment\nof projectile and target remnants.\nNuclear effects related to Cronin transverse momentum broadening, parton saturation,\nand screening have been introduced into EPOS [106].\nFurthermore, high density effects leading to collective behavior in heavy ion collisions\nare also taken into account (\"plasma core\") [107].\nWe first show in fig. 37 pseudorapidity and transverse momentum spectra of charged\nparticles and of different identified hadrons, as well as some particle ratios, in proton-proton\nscattering at 14 TeV. As for heavy ions, the default version of EPOS considers also in protonproton scattering the formation of a core (dense area), with a hydrodynamical collective\nexpansion. Whereas such \"mini-plasma cores\" are negligible in proton-proton scattering at\nRHIC, they play an important role at the LHC, which can be seen from the difference between\nthe full curves (full EPOS, including \"mini-plasma\") and the dotted curves (\"mini-plasma\noption turned off\"). The effect is even more drastic when we investigate the multiplicity\ndependence of particle production, see fig. 37.\nIn the following, we investigate lead-lead collisions at 5.5 TeV. In fig. 38, we plot the\ncentrality dependence of particle yields for charged particles and different identified hadrons.\nWe observe an increase by roughly 2.5 for pions, and a bigger factor for the heavier particles.\nIn fig. 39, we show pseudorapidity spectra, for different particles, at different centralities.\nThe pseudorapidity density of charged particles at \u03b7 = 0 is around 2500, for central collisions.\nIn fig. 40, we show nuclear modification factors RAA (ratios with respect to protonproton, divided by Ncoll ), considering charged particles and different identified hadrons. The\npeak structure of the baryon results is related to the concave form of the baryon spectra from\nthe radially flowing core in PbPb collisions. All curves are well below one, indicating strong\nscreening effects.\n\n\f2\n0\n\n10\n0\n\n5\n+\n\n+\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n14TeV\n20\ndNch/d\u03b7(0)\n\nmean pt (GeV/c)\n\nchgd\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\npt (GeV/c)\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\n2\n2\n2\n\n10\n\u03b7\n\n10\n10\n10\n\n14TeV\n\n-1\n-3\n-5\n\nchgd\n\u03c0\nK\np\n\u039b\n\u039e\n\n\u03b7=0\n\n-7\n\n0\n\n5\npt (GeV/c)\n\n\u039b/K\n\n+\n\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n0.25\n\n14TeV\n\n0.8\n\n10\n\n-\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n5\n\nap/\u03c0\n\n1\n0.75\n\n0\n\nmean pt (GeV/c)\n\n\u03b7\n\n0.75\n0.25\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nK /\u03c0\n\n1\n\n\u03c0\nK\np_\np\n\n1\n\ninel\n\n4\n\n14TeV\n\n14TeV\n\n14TeV\n0\n\n1.5\n\n5\npt (GeV/c)\n_\n\np\n1\n0.5\n\n\u03c0\n0\n\n0\n\n14TeV\n20\ndNch/d\u03b7(0)\n\nmean pt (GeV/c)\n\n6\n\n10\n\n48\ndn/d\u03b7d pt (c /GeV )\n\n14TeV chgd\nNSD\n\n8\n\ndn/d\u03b7\n\ndn/d\u03b7\n\nHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n0\n\n5\npt (GeV/c)\n\n2\n\n\u039b\n\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\nK\n0\n\n14TeV\n20\ndNch/d\u03b7(0)\n\nFigure 37: Proton-proton scattering at 14 TeV: pseudorapidity distributions of charged\nparticles (upper row left), and of different identified hadrons (upper row middle), as\nwell as tranverse momentum spectra of different identified hadrons at \u03b7 = 0 (upper row\nright),transverse momentum dependence of particle ratios at \u03b7 = 0 (middle row),the average\ntransverse momentum of charged particles and of different identified hadrons at \u03b7 = 0\n(lower row).

As the QPM EoS does not automatically fit to\nthe hadron resonance gas EoS in the confinement region, we construct a family of EoS's by\nan interpolation between the hadron resonance gas at e1 = 0.45 GeV/fm3 and the QPM at\nflexible em (cf. [121] for details). In this way, the influence of details in the transition region\non hydrodynamic flow can be studied, since for e < e1 and e > em the EoS is uniquely given\nby the resonance gas and the QCD-based QPM, respectively. In Figure 48, we exhibit the\nEoS family in the form p = p(e) and the corresponding speed of sound v2s = \u2202p/\u2202e.

Predictions for heavy-ion collisions at LHC We concentrate on two extreme EoS's,\nQPM(4.0) and the bag model EoS being similar to QPM(1.0). We calculate transverse\nmomentum spectra and elliptic flow v2 (pT ) using the relativistic hydrodynamic program\npackage [122, 123] with initial conditions for Pb+Pb collisions at impact parameter b = 5.2\nfm. For the further initial parameters required by the program we conservatively guess s0 =\n330 fm\u22123 , n0 = 0.4 fm\u22123 and \u03c40 = 0.6 fm/c for initial entropy density, baryon density and\ntime. Within the QPM these translate into e0 = 127 GeV/fm3 , p0 = 42 GeV/fm3 and T 0 =\n515 MeV. The freeze-out temperature is set T f.o. = 100 MeV. In Figure 49, we exhibit our\nresults at midrapidity for various primordial hadron species. Striking is the strong radial flow\nas evident from the flat pT -spectra and a noticeably smaller v2 (pT ) than at RHIC in particular\nat low pT [121].

The centrality dependence of elliptic flow at LHC\nH.-J. Drescher, A. Dumitru and J.-Y. Ollitrault\nWe present predictions for the centrality dependence of elliptic flow at mid-rapidity in Pb-Pb\ncollisions at the LHC.\n\nThe centrality and system-size dependence of elliptic flow (v2 ) provides direct\ninformation on the thermalization of the matter created in the collision. Ideal (non-viscous)\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n56\n\nhydrodynamics predicts that v2 scales like the eccentricity, \u03b5, of the initial distribution of\nmatter in the transverse plane. Our predictions are based on this eccentricity scaling, together\nwith a simple parameterization of deviations from hydrodynamics [124]:\nh\u03b5\n,\n(20)\nv2 =\n1 + K/0.7\nwhere the scale factor h is independent of system size and centrality, but may depend on the\ncollision energy. The Knudsen number K can be expressed as\n1 \u03c3 dN 1\n=\n\u221a .\nK S dy 3\nIt vanishes in the hydrodynamic limit. dN/dy is the total (charged + neutral) multiplicity per\nunit rapidity, S is the transverse overlap area between the two nuclei, and \u03c3 is an effective\n(transport) partonic cross section.\nThe model has two free parameters, the \"hydrodynamic limit\" h, and the partonic cross\nsection \u03c3. The other quantities, \u03b5, S , dN/dy, must be obtained from a model for the initial\ncondition. Here, we choose the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) approach, including the\neffect of fluctuations in the positions of participant nucleons, which increase \u03b5 [125]. The\nmodel provides a perfect fit to RHIC data for Au-Au and Cu-Cu collisions with h = 0.22 and\n\u03c3 = 5.5 mb [124].\nWe now briefly discuss the extrapolation to LHC. The hydrodynamic limit h is likely to\nincrease from RHIC to LHC, as the QGP phase will last longer; however, we do not have a\nquantitative prediction for h. We predict only the centrality dependence of v2 , not its absolute\nvalue. Figure 50 is drawn with h = 0.22.\nThe second parameter is \u03c3, which parameterizes deviations from ideal hydrodynamics,\ni.e., viscous effects. We consider two possibilities: 1) \u03c3 = 5.5 mb at LHC, as at RHIC. 2)\n\u03c3 \u223c 1/T 2 (on dimensional grounds, assuming that no non-perturbative scales arise), where\nthe temperature T \u223c (dN/dy)1/3 . This gives the value 3.3 mb in figure 50.\nThe remaining quantities (S , dN/dy and \u03b5) are obtained by extrapolating the CGC\nfrom RHIC to LHC, either with fixed-coupling (fc) or running-coupling (rc) evolution of\nthe saturation scale Q s . The multiplicity per participant increases by a factor of 3 (resp. 2.4)\nwith fc (resp. rc). The eccentricity \u03b5 is 10% larger with fc (solid curve in figure 50) than\nwith rc (dash-dotted curve) evolution. Deviations from hydrodynamics (the K-dependent\nfactor in equation (20)) are somewhat smaller than at RHIC: v2 is 90% (resp. 80%) of the\nhydrodynamic limit for central collisions if \u03c3 = 5.5 mb (resp. 3.3 mb). Our predictions lie\nbetween the dashed and dotted curves, up to an overall normalization factor. The maximum\nvalue of v2 occurs for Npart between 60 (\u03c3 \u2248 const.) and 80 (\u03c3 \u223c 1/T 2 ).\nElliptic flow will be a first-day observable at LHC. Both its absolute magnitude and its\ncentrality dependence are sensitive probes of initial conditions, and will help to improve our\nunderstanding of high-density QCD.\n2.3.

The vertical scale is arbitrary (see text).\nWe have previously predicted multiplicities and transverse momentum spectra for the\n\u221a\nmost central LHC Pb+Pb collisions at sNN = 5.5 TeV using pQCD + saturation + hydro\n(EKRT model) [31, 74]. We now extend these calculations for non-central collisions and\npredict low-pT elliptic flow. Our model is in good agreement with RHIC data for central\ncollisions, and we show that our extension of the model is also in good agreement with\n\u221a\nminimum bias v2 data from RHIC Au+Au collisions at sNN = 200 GeV.\nWe obtain the primary partonic transverse energy production and the formation time\nin central AAcollisions from the EKRT model [74]. With the assumption of immediate\nthermalization we can use these to estimate the initial state for hydrodynamic evolution. For\ncentrality dependence we consider here two limits which correspond to models eWN and eBC\nin [127], where the profile and normalization are obtained from optical Glauber model, once\nthe parameters in central collisions are fixed. In the eWN (eBC) model the energy density\nprofile and normalization are proportional to the density and the number of wounded nucleons\n(binary collisions), respectively. These energy density profiles are used to initialize boost\ninvariant hydro code with transverse expansion. We use the bag model equation of state with\nmassless gluons and quarks (N f = 3), and hadronic phase with all hadronic states up to a mass\n2 GeV included. Phase transition temperature is fixed to 165 MeV. Decoupling is calculated\nusing standard Cooper-Frye formula, and all decays of unstable hadronic states are included.\nFreeze-out temperature is fixed from RHIC pT spectra for the most central collisions and\nis 150 MeV for binary collision profile [31] and 140 MeV for wounded nucleon profile. The\nsame freeze-out temperatures are used at the LHC. Both initializations give a good description\nof the low-pT spectra for different centralities at RHIC.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\nLHC eBC\nLHC eWN\nRHIC eBC\nRHIC eWN\n+\n\u2212\nSTAR \u03c0 + \u03c0\n+\nPHENIX \u03c0\n\n0.2\n\nLHC eBC\nLHC eWN\nRHIC eBC\nRHIC eWN\nSTAR anti-p\nPHENIX\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c0+\n\np\n\n0.15\nv2\n\nv2\n\n0.15\n\n58\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\npT [GeV]\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\npT [GeV]\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFigure 51:\nThe left panel of figure 51 shows our calculations for pT dependence of minimum bias\nv2 for positive pions.

Thin lines are our results for RHIC Au+Au collisions at sNN = 200 GeV and\n\u221a\nthick lines show our predictions for the LHC Pb+Pb collisions at sNN = 5.5 TeV. Largest\nuncertainty in v2 calculations for pions comes here from the initial transverse profile of the\nenergy density. Sensitivity to initial time and freeze-out temperature is much weaker. In\ngeneral the eWN profile leads to weaker elliptic flow than the eBC profile. At the LHC the\nlifetime of the QGP phase is longer, which results in stronger flow asymmetry than at RHIC.\nOn the other hand the magnitude of transverse flow is also larger, which decreases the v2\nvalue at fixed pT . The net effect is that, for a given profile, v2 of low-pT pions is larger at the\nLHC than at RHIC. Since jet production at the LHC starts to dominate over the hydrodynamic\nspectra at larger pT than at RHIC [31], we expect that the hydrodynamic calculations should\ncover a larger pT range at the LHC. Thus we predict that the minimum bias v2 of pions at\nfixed pT is larger at the LHC than at RHIC, and can reach values as high as 0.2.\nOur model clearly overshoots the proton v2 data from STAR [128] and PHENIX [129].\nA more detailed treatment of the hadron gas dynamics and freeze-out is needed to describe\nboth the proton spectra and elliptic flow simultaneously. However, we can still predict the\nchange in the behaviour of v2 of protons when going from RHIC to the LHC. This is shown in\nthe r.h.s. of figure 51. Although the flow asymmetry increases at the LHC, for more massive\nparticles like protons the overall increase in the magnitude of radial flow is more important\nthan for light pions. This results in smaller v2 at the LHC than at RHIC in the whole pT range\nfor protons. Even if v2 at fixed pT is smaller at the LHC, pT -integrated v2 is always larger at\nthe LHC for all particles, due to the increase in the relative weight at larger pT 's.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n59\n\n2.4. From RHIC to LHC: Elliptic and radial flow effects on hadron spectra\nG. Kestin and U. Heinz\nUsing (2+1)-d ideal hydrodynamics [130], we computed the evolution from AGS to LHC\nenergies of the pT -spectra and elliptic flow at midrapidity for several hadrons [131]. While\nideal fluid dynamics begins to break down below RHIC energies, due to viscous effects in\nthe late hadronic stage which persist even at RHIC [132], its validity is expected to improve\nat the LHC where the elliptic flow saturates in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) stage, and\neffects from late hadronic viscosity become negligible [133]. Early QGP viscous effects seem\nsmall at RHIC [132, 134], and recent results from Lattice QCD indicate little change of its\nspecific shear viscosity \u03b7/s from RHIC to LHC [135]. The following ideal fluid dynamical\npredictions for soft (pT . 2\u22123 GeV/c) hadron production in (A\u2248200)+(A\u2248200) collisions at\nthe LHC should thus be robust.\nFor Au+Au at RHIC we use standard initial (s0 = 117/fm3 , n B0 = 0.44/fm3 at\n\u03c40 = 0.6 fm/c, corresponding to dNch /dy(y=b=0) = 680) and final conditions (ef = 75 MeV/fm3 ,\nT f = 100 MeV) [130, 134]. For the LHC we assume dNch /dy(y=b=0) = 1200 (the lower end\nof the predicted range), using s0 = 271/fm3 and n B0 = 0 at \u03c40 = 0.45 fm/c, keeping the product\nT 0 \u03c40 and T f unchanged. Predictions for other multiplicities, for interpolation to the actually\nmeasured LHC value, can be found in [131].\n1.

Moln\u00e1r\nIntroduction.\n\nGeneral physics arguments and calculations for a class of conformal\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n61\n\nfield theories suggest [136, 137] that quantum effects impose a lower bound on transport\ncoefficients. For example, the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio is above a small value\n\u03b7/s & 0.1 (\"most perfect fluid\" limit). Dissipative effects can therefore never vanish in a finite,\nexpanding system. On the other hand, ideal (nondissipative) hydrodynamic modelling of\n\u221a\nAu+Au collisions at RHIC ( sNN \u223c 100 GeV) is rather successful, leading many to postulate\nthat the hot and dense QCD matter created is in fact such a \"most perfect fluid\" (at least during\nthe early stages of the RHIC evolution). We predict here how differential elliptic flow v2 (pT )\n\u221a\nchanges from RHIC to LHC collision energies (Pb+Pb at sNN = 5.5 TeV), if the quark-gluon\nsystem created at both RHIC and the LHC has a \"minimal\" shear viscosity \u03b7/s = 1/(4\u03c0).\nCovariant transport theory is a nonequilibrium framework with two main advantages: i)\nit has a hydrodynamic limit (i.e., capable of thermalization); and ii) it is always causal and\nstable. In contrast, hydrodynamics (whether ideal, Navier-Stokes, or second-order IsraelStewart theory [138]) shows instabilities and acausal behavior in certain, potentially large,\nregions of the hydrodynamic \"phase space\".\nWe consider here Lorentz-covariant, on-shell Boltzmann transport theory, with a 2 \u2192 2\nrate [54, 139]\nZ Z Z\n1\n\u03bc\n( f3 f4 \u2212 f1 f2 )W12\u219234 \u03b44 (p1 +p2 \u2212p3 \u2212p4 )\np1 \u2202\u03bc f1 = S (x, ~p1 ) +\n\u03c0 2 3 4\nR R\nThe integrals are shorthands for i \u2261 d3 pi /(2E i ). For dilute systems, f is the phase space\ndistribution of quasi-particles, while the transition probability W = s(s \u2212 4m2 )d\u03c3/dt is given\nby the scattering matrix element. Our interest here, on the other hand, is to study the theory\nnear its hydrodynamic (local equilibrium) limit.\nNear local equilibrium, the transport evolution can be characterized via transport\ncoefficients of shear and bulk viscosities (\u03b7, \u03b6) and heat conductivity (\u03bb) that are determined by\nthe differential cross section. For the massless dynamics (\u01eb = 3p equation of state) considered\nhere \u03b7 \u2248 0.8T/\u03c3tr , \u03b6 = 0, and \u03bb \u2248 1.3/\u03c3tr , \u03c4\u03c0 \u2248 1.2\u03bbtr [138, 140] (\u03c3tr and \u03bbtr are the transport\ncross section and mean free path, respectively).\nMinimal viscosity and elliptic flow. Finite cross sections lead to dissipative effects that\nreduce elliptic flow [141, 142]. For a system near thermal and chemical equilibrium\nundergoing longitudinal Bjorken expansion, T \u223c \u03c4\u22121/3 , s \u2248 4n \u223c T 3 , and thus \u03b7/s = const\nrequires a growing \u03c3tr \u223c \u03c42/3 . With 2 \u2192 2 processes chemical equilibrium is broken, therefore\n\u03c3tr also depends on the density through \u03bc/T \u223c ln n (because s = 4(n \u2212 \u03bc/T )). We ignore this\nweak logarithm and take \u03c3tr (\u03c4) = \u03c30,tr (\u03c4/0.1 fm)2/3 with \u03c30,tr large enough to ensure that most\nof the system is at, or below, the viscosity bound (thus we somewhat underestimate viscous\neffects, i.e., overestimate v2 (pT )).\nFor AA at b = 8 fm impact parameter we use the class of initial conditions in [139] that\nhas three parameters: parton density dN/d\u03b7, formation time \u03c40 , and effective temperature T 0\nthat sets the momentum scale. Because of scalings of the transport solutions [139], v2 (pT /T 0 )\nonly depends on two combinations \u03c3tr dN/d\u03b7 \u223c A\u22a5 \u03c40 /\u03bbtr and \u03c40 . This may look worrisome\nbecause dN/d\u03b7 at the LHC is uncertain by at least a factor of two. However, the \"minimal\nviscosity\" requirement T \u03bbtr \u2248 0.5 fixes \u03c3tr dN/d\u03b7 (e.g., with dN/d\u03b7(b=0) = 1000 at RHIC,\n\u03c30,tr \u2248 2.7 mb), while on dimensional grounds \u03c40 \u223c 1/T 0 .\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n62\n\nThis means that the main difference between LHC and RHIC is in the typical momentum\nscale T 0 (gold and lead nuclei are basically identical), and therefore to good approximation\none expects the simple scaling vLHC\n(pT ) \u2248 vRHIC\n(pT T 0LHC /T 0RHIC ).

Hadronic flavor observables\n3.1. Thermal model predictions of hadron ratios\nA. Andronic, P. Braun-Munzinger and J. Stachel\nWe present predictions of the thermal model for hadron ratios in central Pb+Pb collisions at LHC.\n\nBased on the latest analysis within the thermal model of the hadron yields in central\nnucleus-nucleus collisions [144], the expected values at LHC for the chemical freeze+1.2 MeV,\nout temperature and baryochemical potential are T =161\u00b14 MeV and \u03bcb =0.8\u22120.6\nrespectively.

(Multi)Strangeness Production in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC. HIJING/BB\u0304 v2.0\npredictions.\nV. Topor Pop, J. Barrette, C. Gale, S. Jeon and M. Gyulassy\nStrangeness and multi-strangeness particles production can be used to explore the initial transient\nfield fluctuations in heavy ion collisions. We emphasize the role played by Junction anti-Junction (JJ\u0304)\nloops and strong color electric fields (SCF) in these collisions. Transient field fluctuations of SCF on\n\u221a\nthe baryon production in central (0-5 %) Pb+Pb collisions at sNN = 5.5 TeV will be discussed in\nthe framework of HIJING/BB\u0304 v2.0 model, looking in particular to the predicted evolution of nuclear\nmodification factors (RAA ) from RHIC to LHC energies. Our results indicate the importance of a good\ndescription of the baseline elementary p + p collisions at this energy.\n\nIn previous publications [146] we studied the possible role of topological baryon\njunctions [25], and the effects of strong color field (SCF) in nucleus-nucleus collisions at\nRHIC energies. We have shown that the dynamics of the production process can deviate\nconsiderably from that based on Schwinger-like estimates for homogeneous and constant\ncolor fields. An increase of the string tension from \u03ba0 = 1 GeV/fm, to in medium mean\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n64\n\nvalues of 1.5-2.0 GeV/fm and 2.0-3.0 GeV/fm, for d+Au and Au+Au respectively, results\nin a consistent description of the observed nuclear modification factors (NMF) RAA in both\nreactions and point to the relevance of fluctuations on transient color fields. The model\nprovides also an explanation of the baryon/meson anomaly, and is an alternative dynamical\ndescription of the data to recombination models [147].\nStrangeness enhancement [148], strong baryon transport, and increase of intrinsic\ntransverse momenta kT [149] are all expected consequences of SCF. These are modeled in\nour microscopic models as an increase of the effective string tension that controls the quarkanti-quark (qq\u0304) and diquark - anti-diquark (qqqq) pair creation rates and the strangeness\nsuppression factors. A reduction of the strange (s) quark mass from M s =350 MeV to the\ncurrent quark mass of approximately m s =150 MeV, gives a strangeness suppression factor\n\u03b31s \u2248 0.70. A similar value of \u03b31s (0.69) is obtained by increasing the string tension from\n\u03ba0 =1.0 GeV/fm to \u03ba=3.0 GeV/fm [146]. Howeover, if we consider that Schwinger tunneling\ncould explain the thermal character of hadron spectra we can define an apparent temperature\n\u221a\nas function of the average value of string tension (< \u03ba >), T = 3 < \u03ba > /4\u03c0 [150]. The\npredictions at LHC for initial energy density and temperature are \u01ebLHC \u2248 200 GeV/fm3 and\nT LHC \u2248 500 MeV, respectively [151]. Both values would lead in the framework of our model\nto an estimated increase of the average value of string tension to \u03ba \u2248 5.0 GeV/fm at LHC\nenergy.\n\nFigure 55: HIJING/BB\u0304 v2.0 predictions including SCF effects for NMF of identified particles.\nThe results for proton and lambda particles are for inclusive measurements.\nThe p+p cross sections serve as a baseline reference to calculate NMF for A+ A collisions\n(RAA ). In p + p collisions high baryon/mesons ratio (i.e. close to unity) at intermediate pT\n\u221a\nwere reported at sNN = 1.8 TeV [152]. These data could be fitted assuming a string tension\n\u221a\n\u03ba=2.0 GeV/fm. This value is used in our calculations at sNN = 5.5 TeV. This stresses the\nneed for a reference p + p measurements at LHC energies.\nThe predictions for NMF RPbPb of identified particles at the LHC energy are presented in\nFig. 55 for two values of the string tension. From our model we conclude that baryon/meson\nanomaly, will persist at the LHC with a slight increase for increasing strength of the\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n65\n\nchromoelectric field. The NMF RPbPb also exhibit an ordering with strangeness content at\nlow and intermediate pT . The increase of the yield being higher for multi-strange hyperons\nthan for (non)strange hyperons (RPbPb (\u03a9) > RPbPb (\u039e) > RPbPb(\u039b) > RPbPb (p) ). At high\npT > 4GeV/c for \u03ba=3.0 GeV/fm, a suppression independent of flavours is predicted due to\nquench effects. In contrast, this independence seems to happen at pT > 8 GeV/c for \u03ba=5.0\nGeV/fm.\nAs expected, a higher sensitivity to SCF effects on the pT dependence of multi-strange\nparticle yield ratio is predicted. As an example, Fig. 56 presents our results for the ratio\n(\u03a9\u2212 + \u03a9+ )/\u03a6 in central (0-5%) Pb+Pb collisions and p + p collisions. The results and data at\nRHIC top energy are also included (left panel).\n\nFigure 56: Predictions of HIJING/BB\u0304 v2.0 for the (\u03a9+ + \u03a9\u2212 )/\u03a6 ratio as function of pT\nfor RHIC (left panel) and LHC (right panel) energies. The experimental data are from\nSTAR [153].\nThe mechanisms of (multi)strange particles production is very sensitive to the early phase\nof nuclear collisions, when fluctuation in the color field strength are highest. Their midrapidity yield favors a large value of the average string tension as shown at RHIC and we\nexpect similar dynamical effects at LHC energy. The precision of these predictions depens on\nour knowledge of initial conditions, parton distribution functions at low Bjorken-x, the values\nof the scale parameter p0 , constituent and current (di)quark masses, energy loss for gluon and\nquark jets.\n3.3. Antibaryon to Baryon Production Ratios in Pb-Pb and p-p collision at LHC energies of\nthe DPMJET-III Monte Carlo\nF. Bopp, R. Engel, J. Ranft and S. Roesler\nA sizable component of stopped baryons is predicted for pp and PbPb collisions at LHC. Based\non an analysis of RHIC data within framework of our multichain Monte Carlo DPMJET-III the LHC\npredictions are presented.\n\nThis addendum to Ranft's talk about the main DPMJET III prediction addresses\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n66\n\nbaryon stopping. The interest is a component without leading quarks. Where the flavor\ndecomposition is not determined by final state interactions the valence-quarkless component\ncan be enhanced by considering net strange baryons.\nIn models, in which soft gluons can arbitrarily arrange colors, a configuration can appear\nin which the baryonic charge ends up moved to the center. The actual transport is just an\neffect of the orientation of the color-compensation during the soft hadronisation. Various\nother ideas about fast baryon stopping exist but to have it caused by such an \"initial\" process\nis an attractive option.\nThe \"Dual-Topological\" phenomenology of such baryon transport processes was\ndeveloped 30 years ago [154]. Critical are various baryonium-exchange intercepts which\nwere estimated at that time. Some ambiguity remains until today for the quarkless component (also called \"string junction\" exchange denoted as {S J}) and a confirmation of the flat\nnet-baryon distribution indicated by RHIC data at LHC would be helpful.\nNowadays it is postulated that at very high energy hadronic scattering can be understood\nas extrapolation of BFKL Pomeron exchanges [155] and their condensates in the minimum\nbias region. BFKL Pomerons are described by ladders of dispersion graphs, in which soft\neffects are included using effective gluons. In principle these soft effects include the color\ncompensating mechanism usually modelled as two strings neutralizing triplet colors. A\nnecessary ingredient in this approach are Odderons exchanges with Pomeron-like intercepts\nand with presumably much smaller couplings. As these Odderons can produce a baryon\nexchange of the type discussed above, a small rather flat net baryon component is expected.\nExperimentally, the first indication for a flat component came from never finalized\npreliminary ZEUS data at HERA. As RHIC runs pp or heavy ions instead of p p\u0304 this question\ncould be addressed much better than before and the data seem to require a flat contribution. In\na factorizing Quark-Gluon-String model calculation [156] the best fit to RHIC BRAHMS pp\n\u221a\ndata at s = 200 GeV required diquarks with a probability of \u01eb = 0.024 to involve a quarkless\nbaryonium-exchange with an intercept \u03b1{S J} = 0.9.\nTo obtain such a quarkless baryonium-exchange in the microscopic generator DPMJET\nIII [157] a new string interaction reshuffling the initial strings was introduced. It introduces\nan exchange with a conservative intercept of \u03b1{S J} = 0.5. With this baryonium addition\ngood fits were obtained for various baryon ratios in p \u2212 p and d \u2212 Au RHIC and \u03c0 \u2212 p\nFERMILAB processes [158]. There are of course a number of more conventional baryon\ntransport mechanisms implemented in the model. As the string interaction requires multiple\nPomeron exchanges the new mechanism is actually only a 10% effect at pp RHIC. It is,\nhowever, important for heavy ion scattering or at LHC energies.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n67\n\nFor pp LHC the DPMJET III\nprediction for the pseudo rapidity\nof p, p\u0304, and p \u2212 p\u0304 is shown in the\nFigure on the right. The new\nbaryon stopping is now a 40%\neffect. Of course, with the effective\nintercept of 0.5 the present\nimplementation of the baryon\nstopping is a rather conservative\nestimate. For an intercept of 1.0 the\nvalue at \u03b7 = 0 would roughly\ncorrespond to the present value of\n\u03b7=4\n\nWe now turn to DPMJET III prediction for\ncentral PbPb LHC. For\nthe most central 10%\nof the heavy ion events\nthe pseudorapidity proton and \u039b distributions\nare given in figures below. The PbPb results\nare preliminary, as the\nmodel is not well tested\nin this region.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n68\n\n3.4. Statistical model predictions for pp and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC\nI. Kraus, J. Cleymans, H. Oeschler, K. Redlich and S. Wheaton\nPredictions for particle production at LHC are discussed in the context of the statistical model.\nMoreover, the capability of particle ratios to determine the freeze-out point experimentally is studied,\nand the best suited ratios are specified. Finally, canonical suppression in p-p collisions at LHC energies\nis discussed in a cluster framework. Measurements with pp collisions will allow us to estimate the\nstrangeness correlation volume and to study its evolution over a large range of incident energies.\n\nParticle production in heavy-ion collisions is, over a wide energy range, consistent with\nthe assumption that hadrons originate from a thermal source with a given temperature T and\na given baryon chemical potential \u03bcB . In the framework of the statistical model, we exploit\nthe feature that the freeze-out points appear on a common curve in the T \u2212 \u03bcB plane. The\nparameterization of this curve, taken from reference [159], is used to extrapolate to the LHC\n\u221a\nenergy of sNN = 5.5 TeV: T \u2248 170 MeV, \u03bcB \u2248 1 MeV.\nFor the given thermal conditions, particle ratios in central Pb-Pb collisions were\ncalculated; numerical values are given in reference [160]. As soon as experimental results\nbecome available, the extrapolation can be cross-checked with particle ratios that exhibit\na large sensitivity to the thermal parameters. The ratios shown in figure 57 (left) hardly\nvary over a broad range of T and \u03bcB . This feature can be used to investigate the validity\nof the statistical model at LHC: Especially the prediction for the K/\u03c0 ratio is limited to a\nnarrow range. It would be hard to reconcile experimental results outside of this band with the\nstatistical model.\nAntiparticle over particle ratios, on the other hand, strongly depend on \u03bcB (figure 57,\nmiddle panel). Most of all, the p\u0304/p ratio almost directly translates to the baryon chemical\npotential, since the T dependence is very weak. Better suited for the temperature\ndetermination are ratios with large mass differences, i.e. \u03a9/\u03c0 and \u03a9/K, which increase in\nthe studied range by 25% per 10 MeV change in T . The astonishing similarity between K and\n\u03c0 in this respect is caused by the huge contribution of 75% from resonance decays to pions\nfor the given thermal conditions [161].\nIn collisions of smaller systems, the strange-particle phase-space exhibits a suppression\nbeyond the expected canonical suppression. A modification of the statistical model is\nproposed in references [162, 163], which is based on the assumption that strangeness\nconservation is maintained in correlated sub-volumes of the fireball. The size of these clusters,\nwhich could be smaller than the volume defined by all hadrons, was estimated from relative\nstrangeness production in collisions of small systems at top SPS and RHIC energy. The\nradius RC of a spherical cluster is of the order of 1 - 2 fm and shows only a weak energy\ndependence. Additionally it is not clear at which stage of the interaction the strangeness\nabundance is formed. Possibly the early, dense phase is crucial, so the cluster size should be\nthe same at RHIC and LHC, or, on the contrary, the total number of particles at the late stage\nof hadronisation is relevant; thus RC should increase as the multiplicity will increase with\ncolliding energy.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\u03bcB = 1 MeV\n\nT = 170 MeV\n1\n\n\u03bcB = 1 MeV\n\nb\n\n0.02\n\n\u03a9- / K \u03a9- / \u03c0- 5\n\u039e- / \u03c0- 0.5\n\u03a9- / p 0.2\n\n1\n\nR\n\n10-2\n\nR\n\nR\n\n0.2\n\na\n\nK+ / \u03c0+\n\nGrand CanonicalPbPb\n\n\u2206S=1\n\nK- / K +\n+\n\u03a9 / \u03a9+\n\u039e / \u039e\u039b/\u039b\np/p\n\n0.8\n\n\u03a9- / \u039e\u039e- / \u039b\n\u039b / p \u2217 0.3\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\u03bcB (MeV)\n\n160\nT (MeV)\n\n180\n\n0\n\n-4\n\n10\n\nCanonicalpp, RC=2 fm\nCanonicalpp, RC=1.5 fm\nCanonicalpp, RC=1 fm\nCanonicalpp, RC=0.75 fm\n\n20\n\u03bcB (MeV)\n\n160\n\n180\n\n0\n200\n\nT (MeV)\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n\u039b /\u039b\n+ \u039e /\u039e\n+\n\u03a9 /\u03a9p/\u03c0\n+\nK /\u03c0+\nK /\u03c0\u039b/p\n\u039e /\u039b\n- \u03a9 /\u039e\n- \u03a9 /K\n\u03a9 /\u03c0-\n\nK- / \u03c0-\n\n\u03c0+/\u03c0K+/K\np/p\n\nT = 170 MeV\n\n69\n\nFigure 57: Left: Ratios R of particles with unequal strangeness content as a function of \u03bcB for\nT = 170 MeV (left) and as a function of T for \u03bcB = 1 MeV (right).\nMiddle: Antiparticle/particle ratios R as a function of \u03bcB for T = 170 MeV (left) (the\nhorizontal line at 1 is meant to guide the eye).

This presentation is more specific regarding the yields\nin order to allow \"first-day\" understanding of the mechanisms of hadronization dynamics of\n\u221a\nthe deconfined quark\u2013gluon plasma phase formed in most central sNN = 5520 GeV Pb\u2013Pb\nreactions at the LHC.\nOur detailed results rely on SHARE-2.2 suite of programs [170], which have been\nextensively tested, with several typos, and errors corrected compared to earlier releases\nSHARE-1.x [171], and SHARE-2.1 . An important feature of the SHARE suite of\nprograms is that one can obtain the particle multiplicities for any consistent mixed set of\nextensive/intensive bulk matter parameters and/or particle yields. What 'consistency' means\ncan be understood considering the variables in the Gibbs-Duham relation:\nX\nX\nPV + E = T S +\n\u03bca Na , \u03bca =\nT ln \u03b3i + bi \u03bcB + si \u03bcS ,\n(23)\na\n\ni\u2208a\n\nwhere the extensive V (volume), E \u2261 V\u01eb (energy), S \u2261 V\u03c3 (entropy), Ni \u2261 V\u03c1i (particle\nnumber) appears along with intensive P (pressure), T (temperature), and \u03bci (particle chemical\npotential). Aside of the above strict constraint, other qualitative constraints arise and thus, in\nour approach, we allow for a deviation from prescribed parameter values within a margin of\na few percent, to be chosen in a quasi-fit procedure in order to alleviate inconsistencies in the\nchoices made.\nConsidering the limited central rapidity experimental coverage, we refer instead of\nthe total volume V to the range associated with the central rapidity dV/dy, thus dS /dy =\n(dS /dV)(dV/dy) is the entropy (multiplicity) yield per unit of rapidity. One can show that\ndS /dy is conserved in the hydrodynamic expansion of the bulk matter, thus the final observed\nentropy (multiplicity) content per unit of rapidity is the outcome of the initial state entropy\nproduction.\nThe soft hadron production at LHC-Ion relies on the following input:\nI The entropy content: dS /dy \u2261 hadron multiplicity - this is normalizer of all particle\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n72\n\nyields for which the predictions most widely vary. The straight line extrapolation as function\n\u221a\nof ln sNN implies an increase of dS /dy by only a factor 1.65 from RHIC top energy reach\n\u221a\n\u221a\nsNN = 200 GeV to the LHC-ion top energy of sNN = 5520 GeV. The charged particle\nyield per unit rapidity is expected, in this case, at about hch = 1150. Since this extrapolation\nis done based on PHOBOS multiplicity, only partial K s weak interaction decay is allowed\nfor. We will also state the corresponding hvis\nwhich is computed assuming acceptance of\nch\nweak decays akin to the STAR detector. The entropy content determines up to about 15% the\nenergy content dE/dy \u2243 T h dS /dy which thus increases, in essence, by the same factor. We\nnote that model differences in hadronization temperature T h which are in the range of up to\n20% impact accordingly the thermal energy content.\nHowever, one can wonder if the factor 1.65 correctly accounts for the 28-fold reaction\nenergy increase between RHIC and LHC-ion. The widening of the particle production rapidity\nwindow accounts for much of the collision energy increase. How this widening occurs i.e the\nstrength of stopping, determines the central rapidity energy deposition. We thus consider in\nthe second example the case with 3.4-fold increase in entropy/multiplicity content per unit\nof rapidity. This value is fine-tuned such that the visible charged hadron yield is identical to\nthe TPC-visible charged hadron multiplicity yield in the chemical equilibrium model, where\nthe hadronization volume was set to be V = 6200 fm3 (our 3rd table entry). This allows to\ncompare the yields of both models normalized to same hadron yield.\nII The strangeness content ds/dy = d s\u0304/dy and/or (ds/dy)/(dS /dy) = s/S . The production\nof strangeness has been evaluated within pQCD, for a given entropy content. The final\nstrangeness yield does not depend in a significant way on how the parton entropy content\nis implemented in the early reaction times where thermal distributions are reached (e.g., high\nT , low chemical abundances, low T , high chemical abundances). This is so, since strangeness,\nbeing a relatively strongly interacting probe, does not convey a detailed information about the\nearly \u03c4 < 2 fm/c times of the heavy ion collision. For the case of a greater (3.4-times increased)\nentropy/multiplicity content, the pQCD computation suggests s/S \u2243 0.037 yield, which is\n10\u201315% above QGP chemical equilibrium, the lower entropy variant (extrapolated factor\n1.65 increase in multiplicity) implies for QGP-strangeness a small excess above chemical\nequilibrium, we will use s/S \u2243 0.034. For the third case, the hadron chemical equilibrium,\nthe ratio s/S = 0.025 results. Thus, strangeness enhancement, where it is not washed out by\na lower hadronization temperature, is the salient feature of the non-equilibrium hadronization\npicture we have developed and present here.\nIII The net baryon stopping d(b \u2212 b\u0304)/dy is unknown, and will be difficult to measure. An\nextrapolation of the energy per baryon retained per unit of rapidity yields E/b \u2243 412 \u00b1 20 GeV\nat LHC. This value is consistent with the here considered two cases, when, as an example,\nwe fix \u03bbq = 1.0056 which determines the baryon and hyperon chemical potentials \u03bcB and \u03bcS .\nWe note, in passing, that in all the cases considered here, we find for the baryon asymmetry\nat LHC (b \u2212 b\u0304)/(b + b\u0304) \u2243 0.015, which is 6\u20137 orders of magnitude larger compared to the\nconditions prevailing in the early universe.\nThere are constrains which we use to fully determine the system properties:\n1) For the chemical non-equilibrium hadronization we will use T h = 140 MeV while for\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n73\n\nchemical equilibrium we adopt T h = 162 MeV. Both values are taken from the study of\nhighest RHIC energies. The lower T arises due to supercooling expansion, leading to sudden\nhadronization [172], and thus, we also impose a bias for E/T S > 1.\n2) Strangeness balance hsi = h s\u0304i in the central unit of rapidity.\n3) Net charge per net baryon ratio Q/b = 0.4 (value in colliding nuclei) is implemented. Since\nthe net baryon number is rather small, the charge asymmetry is for all purposes invisible, the\npurpose of this exercise is to assure physical consistency and to fix the isospin asymmetry\nstatistical parameter \u03bb3 .\nOur results are presented in detail in the table. We note that the total charged hadron\nmultiplicity will be a first-day observable at LHC and hence much of the uncertainty we\nhave in discussing the absolute hadron yields will disappear. When comparing hadronization\nmodels at fixed total hadron yield one sees clear differences in yield pattern:\na) Multi-strange hadron yields are, in general, greatly enhanced in our non-equilibrium\napproach as compared to yields assuming chemical equilibrium hadronization, yet single\nstrange yields are often similar, since the differences in hadronization (temperature) conditions\ncompensate for the strangeness yield enhancement;\nb) The yields of non-strange resonances are, in general, significantly greater in the chemical\nequilibrium model, due to the higher hadronization temperature.\nc) This suppression is compensated in resonances with single and partial multi-strange content\n(\u03b7, \u03b7\u2032 ).\nThe above differences, already seen at RHIC, are much more striking at LHC, since the\nspecific strangeness per entropy yield enhancement is by factor 1.5. Even the visible K+ /\u03c0+vis\nratio is increased from the RHIC level, to K+ /\u03c0+vis \u2243 0.17 \u20130.18, however this enhancement\neffect is much better visible once weak decays have been vetoed in the pion yield, in which\ncase, we predict K+ /\u03c0+ \u2243 0.21. While the yield of nucleons may be difficult to determine,\nthe measurement of baryon resonances such as \u2206(1230) could help considerably in the\ncharacterization of the baryon yield.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\nT [MeV]\ndV/dy[ fm3 ]\ndS /dy\ndhch /dy\ndhvis\n/dy\nch\n1000 * (\u03bbq, s \u2212 1)\n\u03bcB, S [MeV]\n\u03b3q, s\ns/S\nE/b\nE/T S\nP/E\nE/V[MeV/fm3 ]\nP[MeV]\np\nb \u2212 b\u0304\n(b + b\u0304)/h\u2212\n0.1 * \u03c0\u00b1\nK\u00b1\n\u03c6\n\u039b\n\u039e\u2212\n\u03a9\u2212\n\u22060 , \u2206++\nK0\u2217 (892)\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\u2032\n\u03c1\n\u03c9\nf0\n+\nK /\u03c0+vis\n\u039e\u2212 /\u039bvis\n\u039b(1520)/\u039bvis\n\u039e(1530)0 /\u039e\u2212\n\u03c6/K+\nK0\u2217 (892)/K \u2212\n\n140\u2217\n140\u2217\n162\u2217\n2036\n4187\n6200\u2217\n7517\n15262\n18021\n\u2217\n1150\n2351\n2430\n\u2217\n1351\n2797\n2797\n\u2217\n\u2217\n5.6 , 2.1 5.6 , 2.1 5.6\u2217 , 2.0\n2.4, 0.5\n2.3, 0.5 2.7, 0.6\n1.62, 2.42 1.6\u2217 , 2.6\n1\u2217 , 1\u2217\n0.034\u2217\n0.037\u2217\n0.025\n\u2217\n420\n428\n408\n1.02\n1.05\n0.86\n0.165\n0.164\n0.162\n530\n538\n400\n87\n88\n65\n25/45\n49/95\n66/104\n2.6\n5.3\n6.1\n0.335\n0.345\n0.363\n49/67\n99/126 103/126\n94\n207\n175\n14\n33\n23\n19/28\n41/62\n37/50\n4\n9.5\n5.8\n0.82\n2.08\n0.98\n4.7\n9.3\n13.7\n22\n48\n52\n62\n136\n127\n5.2\n11.8\n11.5\n36\n73\n113\n32\n64\n104\n2.7\n5.5\n9.7\n0.165\n0.176\n0.148\n0.145\n0.153\n0.116\n0.043\n0.042\n0.060\n0.33\n0.33\n0.36\n0.15\n0.16\n0.13\n0.236\n0.234\n0.301\n\n74\n\nTable: LHC predictions, two variants\nof our non-equilibrium hadronization\nmodel are shown on left, the chemical equilibrium model results are stated\nfor comparison in the right column.\nTo obtain results n the first column,\nwe considered an overall hadron yield\nchosen to increase at central rapidity\nby factor 1.65 compared to PHOBOS\nresults (star '*' indicates a fixed input value).

In the third section, we\nshow bulk properties at hadronization,\nwith specific strangeness content prescribed as arising in pQCD computation [169], except for the equilibrium\nmodel in which case the specific yield\ns/S is a consequence of the equilibrium assumption. One notes for the\nequilibrium model that the energy density and pressure at hadronization is\nsmaller, which agrees with the greater\nvolume of hadronization required to\nobtain the same hadron yield.

Correlations at low transverse momentum\n4.1. Pion spectra and HBT radii at RHIC and LHC\nYu. M. Sinyukov, S. V. Akkelin and Iu. A. Karpenko\nWe describe RHIC pion data in central A+A collisions and make predictions for LHC based on\nhydro-kinetic model, describing continuous 4D particle emission, and initial conditions taken from\nColor Glass Condensate (CGC) model.\n\nHydro-kinetic approach to heavy ion collisions proposed in Ref. [173] accounts for\ncontinuous particle emission from 4D volume of hydrodynamically expanding fireball as\nwell as back reaction of the emission on the fluid dynamics. The approach is based on the\ngeneralized relaxation time approximation for relativistic finite expanding systems,\nf (x, p) \u2212 f l.eq.

(x, p) is local equilibrium\ndistribution and \u03c4rel (x, p) is relaxation time, \u03c4rel (x, p) as well as f l.eq are functional of\nhydrodynamic variables. Complete algorithm described in detail in Ref. [174] includes:\nsolution of equations of ideal hydro; calculation of a non local equilibrium DF and emission\nfunction in the first approximation; solution of equations for ideal hydro with non-zero righthand-side that accounts for conservation laws at the particle emission during expansion;\ncalculation of \"improved\" DF and emission function; evaluation of spectra and Bose-Einstein\ncorrelations. Here we present our results for the pion momentum spectra and interferometry\nradii calculated for RHIC and LHC energies in the first approximation of the hydro-kinetic\napproach.\nFor simulations we utilize ideal fluid model [175\u2013177] and realistic equation of state\n(EoS) that combines high temperature EoS with crossover transition [178] adjusted to the\nQCD lattice data and EoS of hadron resonance gas with partial chemical equilibrium [175\u2013\n177]. The gradual disappearance of pions during the crossover transition to deconfinement\nand different intensity of interactions of pions in pure hadronic and \"mixed\" phases are taken\ninto account in the hydro-kinetic model (HKM), but resonance contribution to pion spectra\nand interferometry radii is not taken into account in the present version of the HKM. We\nassume the following initial conditions at proper time \u03c40 = 1 fm/c for HKM calculations:\nboost-invariance of a system in longitudinal direction and cylindrical symmetry with Gaussian\nenergy density profile in transverse plane. The maximal energy densities at RHIC, \u01eb0 = 30\nGeV/fm3 and at LHC, \u01eb0 = 70 GeV/fm3 , were calculated from Ref. [179] in approximation of\nBjorken expansion of free ultrarelativistic partons till \u03c40 and adjusted for transverse Gaussian\ndensity profile. The (pre-equilibrium) initial transverse flows at \u03c40 were estimated assuming\nagain a free-streaming of partons, with transverse modes distributed according to CGC\npicture, from proper time \u2248 0.1 fm/c till \u03c40 = 1 fm/c. Finally, we approximate the transverse\nvelocity profile by vT = tanh(\u03b1 * RrTT ) where \u03b1 = 0.2 both for RHIC and LHC energies and we\nsuppose the fitting Gaussian radius for RHIC top energy, RT = 4.3, to be the same for LHC\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n102\n\nPHENIX\nHKM, \u22080=30 GeV/fm3 (RHIC)\n3\nHKM, \u22080=70 GeV/fm (LHC)\nHKM, \u22080=110 GeV/fm3 (LHC)\n\n7\n\n6\nR [fm]\n\nT\n\nRout\n\nPHENIX\nHKM, \u22080=30 GeV/fm3 (RHIC)\n3\nHKM, \u22080=70 GeV/fm (LHC)\nHKM, \u22080=110 GeV/fm3 (LHC)\n\nT\n\nd2N/(2\u03c0 p dp dy) [GeV -2]\n\n\u03c0 spectra\n\n76\n\n10\n\n5\n\n4\n1\n3\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n1.2\np [GeV]\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n7.5\n\nPHENIX\nHKM, \u22080=30 GeV/fm3 (RHIC)\n3\nHKM, \u22080=70 GeV/fm (LHC)\nHKM, \u22080=110 GeV/fm3 (LHC)\n\n6.5\n6\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nT\n\n10\n\nRside\n\n7\n\n0.8\np [GeV]\n\nT\n\nRlong\n\nPHENIX\nHKM, \u22080=30 GeV/fm3 (RHIC)\n3\nHKM, \u22080=70 GeV/fm (LHC)\nHKM, \u22080=110 GeV/fm3 (LHC)\n\n9\n8\n\nR [fm]\n\nR [fm]\n\n7\n5.5\n5\n\n6\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3.5\n\n3\n\n3\n2\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\np [GeV]\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\np [GeV]\n\nT\n\nT\n\nFigure 60: Comparison of the single-particle momentum spectra of pions and pion Rout , R side , Rlong radii\nmeasured by the PHENIX Collaboration for Au+Au central collisions (HBT radii data were recalculated for\n0 \u2212 5% centrality) at RHIC with the HKM calculations, and HKM predictions for Pb+Pb central collisions at\nLHC.

All other jets result in correlations that have peaks at different\nangles, with the deviation getting bigger when going away from the middle. Therefore, the\nspeed of sound will always appear to be smaller than it actually is.\n4.2.3. Conclusions If sound waves are produced from jet quenching in LHC-Collisions,\nthe two-particle correlation function will show the expected double-humped structure in the\nbackward region. The peaks will, though, be further apart than \u03b4(\u2206\u03c6) = 2 cos\u22121 cS , thus\nalluding to a speed of sound smaller than is actually present in the medium.\nThe only case in which the true speed of sound can be measured is a midrapidity jet that\ncreates a symmetric correlation function.\n4.3. Study of Mach Cones in (3+1)d Ideal Hydrodynamics at LHC Energies\nB. Betz, P. Rau, G. Torrieri, D. Rischke and H. St\u00f6cker\nThe energy loss of jets created in heavy\u2013ion collisions shows an anomalous behaviour of the\nangular distribution of particles created by the away-side jet due to the interaction of the jet with the\nmedium [184, 185]. Recent three\u2013particle correlations [180, 186, 187] confirm that a Mach cone is\ncreated. Ideal (3+1)d hydrodynamics [188] is used to study the creation and propagation of such Mach\ncones under LHC conditions.\n\nJets are one possible probe to study the medium created in a heavy\u2013ion collision. They\nare assumed to be formed in an early stage of the collision and to interact with the hot and\ndense nuclear matter.\nExperimental results from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) show a\nsuppression of the away\u2013side jet in Au+Au collisions for high-p\u22a5 particles as compared to\nthe away\u2013side jet in p+p collisions. This effect is commonly interpreted as jet energy loss or\njet quenching [184, 185]. However, studies including low-p\u22a5 particles [180, 186, 187] exhibit\na double peaked away\u2013side jet. Recent three\u2013particle correlations confirm that this pattern is\ndue to a creation of a Mach cone [180, 186, 187].\nThe interaction of a jet with the medium is theoretically not well enough understood.\nTherefore, we compare two models of energy loss under LHC conditions. We consider a\nmedium with an initial radius of 3.5 fm and an initial energy density of e0 = 1.7 GeV/fm3 that\nundergoes a Bjorken\u2013like expansion according to a bag\u2013model equation of state (EoS) with a\nfirst\u2013order phase transition from a hadron gas to the quark\u2013gluon plasma (QGP) with a mixed\nphase between eH = 0.1 GeV/fm3 and eQ = 1.69 GeV/fm3 .\nIn the first scenario, we implement a jet that completely deposits its energy and\nmomentum during a very short time in a 0.25 fm3 spatial volume. Initially, the jet is located\nbetween \u22123.5 fm < x < \u22122.5 fm, |y| < 0.25 fm, |z| < 0.25 fm, has a velocity of v x = 0.99 c and\ntraverses the medium along the x-axis. Totally, it deposits an energy of 15 GeV, no rapidity\ncut is applied.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n79\n\nIn a second step, we study a 15 GeV jet that gradually deposits its energy and momentum\nin equal time steps of \u2206t = 0.8 fm/c. As in the first scenario, the jet traverses the medium with\na velocity of v x = 0.99 c along the x\u2013axis.\nThe hydrodynamic evolution is stopped after a time of 7.2 fm/c. Using a Monte Carlo\nsimulation based on the SHARE program [171], an isochronous freezeout according to\nthe Cooper\u2013Frye formula is performed, considering a gas of rhos, pions and etas in the\npseudorapidity interval of [-2.3,2.3].\nFigure 63 shows the angular distribution of particles for the first (left panel) and second\n(right panel) scenario, without any background subtraction. The omitted near\u2013side jet would\nappear at \u03c6 = 0.\nIn case of a short\u2013time energy and momentum deposition, a broad away\u2013side distribution\n(left panel) occurs, due to the deposition and dissipation of kinetic energy caused by the\njet. However, if the jet gradually dispenses its energy and momentum (right panel), two\nmaxima appear. This Mach cone\u2013like structure agrees with the recent STAR and PHENIX\ndata [180, 186, 187].\n4.4. Forward-Backward (F-B) rapidity correlations in a two step scenario\nJ. Dias de Deus and J. G.

We can\nrewrite equation (28) in the form\nx\n,\n(29)\nb=\n1 + K\u2032 x\nwhere K \u2032 \u2261 K/hn B i is a constant and x \u2261 hn B i/hnF i.

Cherenkov rings of hadrons\nI. M. Dremin\nThe ring-like structure of inelastic events in heavy ion collisions becomes pronounced when the\ncondition for the emission of Cherenkov gluons is fulfilled.\n\nIn heavy ion collisions any parton can emit a gluon. On its way through the nuclear\nmedium the gluon collides with some internal modes. Therefore it affects the medium as\nan \"effective\" wave which accounts also for the waves emitted by other scattering centers.\nBeside incoherent scattering, there are processes which can be described as the refraction of\nthe initial wave along the path of the coherent wave. The Cherenkov effect is the induced\ncoherent radiation by a set of scattering centers placed on the way of propagation of the\ngluon. Considered first for events at very high energies [194, 195], the idea about Cherenkov\ngluons was extended to resonance production [196,197]. The refractive index and the forward\n\u221a\nscattering amplitude F(E, 0o ) at energy E = s are related as\n\u2206n = Ren \u2212 1 =\n\n8\u03c0N s ReF(E, 0o )\n.\nE2\n\n(31)\n\nN s is the density of the scattering centers in the medium.\nThe necessary condition for Cherenkov radiation is\n\u2206n > 0 or ReF(E, 0o ) > 0.\n\n(32)\n\nIf these inequalities are satisfied, Cherenkov gluons are emitted along the cone with half-angle\n\u03b8c in the rest system of the medium determined by n:\n1\n(33)\ncos \u03b8c =\nn\nPrediction The rings of hadrons similar to usual Cherenkov rings of photons can be observed\nin the plane perpendicular to the cone (jet) axis if n > 1.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n82\n\nProposal Plot the one-dimensional pseudorapidity (\u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan \u03b8/2) hadron distribution with\ntrigger jet momentum as z-axis. It should have maximum at (33).\nThis is the best possible one-dimensional projection of the ring. To define the refractive\nindex in the absence of the theory of nuclear media (for a simplified approach see [198]) I\nprefer to rely on our knowledge of hadronic reactions. From experiments at comparatively\nlow energies we learn that the resonances are abundantly produced. They are described by\nthe Breit-Wigner amplitudes which have a common feature of the positive real part in the\nlow-mass wing (e.g., see Feynman lectures). Therefore the hadronic refractive index exceeds\n1 in these energy regions.\nAt high energies the experiment and dispersion relations indicate on positive real parts\nof amplitudes for all hadronic reactions above a very high threshold. Considering gluons as\ncarriers of strong forces one can assume that the similar features are typical for their amplitude\nas well. Then one should await for two energy regions in which Cherenkov gluons play a role.\nThose are either gluons with energies which fit the left wings of resonances produced in their\ncollisions with internal modes of the medium or with very high energies over some threshold.\nThe indications on \"low\" energy effects come from RHIC [187] where the two-bump\nstructure of the angular distribution of hadrons belonging to the so-called companion (awayside) jet in central heavy-ion collisions has been observed. It arises as the projection of a\nring on its diameter and provides important information on the properties of the nuclear\nmedium [196, 197]. From the distance between peaks the cone half-angle is found to be\nabout 60o \u2212 70o in the c.m.s. which is equivalent to the target rest system for the trigger at\ncentral rapidities. Derived from it and Eq.(33) are the large refractive index (n \u2248 3) and parton\ndensity (\u03bd \u2248 20 within a nucleon volume) that favor the state of a liquid. The energy loss\n(dE/dx \u2248 1GeV/fm) is moderate and the free path length is of a nuclear size. The threeparticle correlations also favor the ring-like structure.\nThe indications on high energy effects came from the cosmic ray event [199] at energy\nabout 1016 eV (LHC!) with two ring-like regions. They are formed at such angles in the target\nrest system which are equivalent to 60o \u2212 70o and 110o \u2212 120o in c.m.s. It corresponds to the\nrefractive index close to 1 that well fits results of dispersion relations and experiment at these\nenergies. Such dependence on parton energy shows that the same medium could be seen as a\nliquid by rather slow partons and as a gas by very fast ones.\nIt is crucial for applicability of Eq.(33) to define properly the target rest system. In RHIC\nexperiments the parton-trigger moves in the transverse direction to the collision axis and, on\nthe average, \"sees\" the target (the primary fireball) at rest in c.m.s. dealing with rather low\nx and Q2 . In the cosmic event the narrow forward ring is produced by fast forward moving\npartons (large x) which \"see\" the target at rest in the lab. system. At LHC one can await for\nboth types of Cherenkov gluons produced. Thus, the hadronic Cherenkov effect can be used\nas a tool to scan (1/x, Q2 )-plane and plot on it the parton densities (see Eq.(31)) corresponding\nto its different regions.\nTo conclude, the ring-like structure of inelastic processes must be observed if the gluonic\nCherenkov effects are strong enough. The ring parameters reveal the properties of the nuclear\nmedium and their energy dependence.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n83\n\n4.6. Evolution of pion HBT radii from RHIC to LHC \u2013 predictions from ideal hydrodynamics\nE. Frodermann, R. Chatterjee and U. Heinz\nWe use the longitudinally boost-invariant relativistic ideal hydrodynamic code\nAZHYDRO [130] to predict the expected trends for the evolution from RHIC to LHC of\nthe HBT radii at mid-rapidity in central (A\u2248200)+(A\u2248200) collisions, as well as that of their\nnormalized oscillation amplitudes in non-central collisions. We believe that these trends may\nbe trustworthy, in spite of the model's failure to correctly predict the HBT radii at RHIC [200].\nThe results shown here are selected from Ref.

Since we computed the HBT radii from the\nspace-time variances of the emission function instead of doing a Gaussian fit to the two-pion\ncorrelation function, all Rl values should be corrected downward by about 20% [202]. We\nsee no dramatic changes, neither in magnitude nor in KT -dependence, of the HBT radii as we\nincrease the multiplicity by up to a factor 3. The largest increase (by \u223c 30% at low KT ) is\nseen for R s , while Ro even slightly decreases at large KT . Rl changes hardly at all.

However, a good description of SPS and RHIC data have been obtained in\nvarious models based on hydro-inspired parametrizations of freeze-out hypersurface. Thus,\nwe have achieved this goal within our fast hadron freeze-out MC generator (FASTMC) [204].\nIn FASTMC, particle multiplicities are determined based on the concept of chemical freezeout. Particles and hadronic resonances are generated on the thermal freeze-out hypersurface,\nthe hadronic composition at this stage is defined by the parameters of the system at chemical\nfreeze-out [204]. The input parameters which control the execution of our MC hadron\ngenerator in the case of Bjorken-like parameterization of the thermal freeze-out hypersurface\n(similar to the well known \"Blast-Wave\" parametrization with the transverse flow) for central\ncollisions are the following: temperature T ch and chemical potentials per a unit charge\ne\n\u03bcB ,e\n\u03bcS ,e\n\u03bcQ at chemical freeze-out, temperature T th at thermal freeze-out, the fireball transverse\nradius R, the mean freeze-out proper time \u03c4 and its standard deviation \u2206\u03c4 (emission duration),\nof\nthe maximal transverse flow rapidity \u03c1max\nu .

Moreover, for ultrarelativistic velocities of the jet the most unstable modes correspond\nto relative angles between the velocity of the jet and momentum of the collective mode \u223c \u03c0/4. Our\nresults suggest an alternative mechanism for the description of the jet quenching phenomenon, where\nthe jet crossing the plasma loses energy exciting colored unstable modes. In LHC this effect should be\nseen with an enhanced production of hadrons for some specific values of their momenta and in certain\ndirections of momenta space.\n\nIt has been suggested that a high pT jet crossing the medium produced after a relativistic\nheavy ion collision, and travelling at a velocity higher than the speed of sound should form\nshock waves with a Mach cone structure [206, 207]. Such shock waves should be detectable\nin the low pT parton distributions at angles \u03c0 \u00b1 1.2 with respect to the direction of the trigger\nparticle. A preliminary analysis of the azimuthal dihadron correlation performed by the\nPHENIX Collaboration [208] seems to suggest the formation of such a conical flow.\nWe propose a novel possible collective process to describe the jet quenching\nphenomenon. In our approach a neutral beam of colored particles crossing an equilibrated\nquark-gluon plasma induces plasma instabilities [209]. Such instabilities represent a very\nefficient mechanism for converting the energy and momenta stored in the total system\n(composed by the plasma and the jet) into (growing) energy and momenta of gauge fields,\nwhich are initially absent. To the best of our knowledge, only reference [210] considers the\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n87\n\npossibility of the appearance of filamentation instabilities produced by hard jets in heavy-ion\ncollisions.\nWe have studied this phenomenon using the chromohydrodynamical approach developed\nin [211], assuming the conformal limit for the plasma. Since we are describing the system\nemploying ideal fluid-like equations, our results are valid at time scales shorter than the\naverage time for collisions. A similar analysis using kinetic theory, and reaching to similar\nresults, will soon be reported.\nWe have studied the dispersion laws of the gauge collective modes and their dependence\non the velocity of the jet v, the magnitude of the momentum of the collective mode k, the angle\n\u03b8 between these quantities, and of the plasma frequencies of both the plasma \u03c9 p and the jet\n\u03c9jet . We find that there \u221a\nis always one unstable mode if the velocity of the jet is larger than the\nspeed of sound c s = 1/ 3, and if the momentum of the collective mode is in modulus smaller\nthan a threshold value. Quite interestingly we find that the unstable modes with momentum\nparallel to the velocity of the jet is the dominant one for velocity of the jet v . 0.8. For larger\nvalues of the jet velocity only the modes with angles larger than \u223c \u03c0/8 are significant and the\ndominant unstable modes correspond to angles \u223c \u03c0/4 (see figure 69).\n\n\u0393max/\u03c9t\n\n0.16\n\n\u0393max/\u03c9t\n\n0.16\n\n0.08\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.08\n\u03b8=0\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/8\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/4\n\u03b8 = 3\u03c0/8\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/2\n\n0.05\n\nb\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03b8=0\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/8\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/4\n\u03b8 = 3\u03c0/8\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/2\n\n0.05\n\nb\n\n0.1\n\nFigure 69: Largest value of the imaginary part of the dispersion law for the unstable mode as\na function of b = \u03c92jet /\u03c92p for two different values of the velocity of the jet v and five different\nangles between k and v. The left/right panels correspond to v = 0.8/0.9, respectively.\nOur numerical results imply that both in RHIC and in the LHC these instabilities develop\nvery fast, faster in the case of the LHC as there one assumes that \u03c9 p will attain larger values.\nFurther, the soft gauge fields will eventually decay into soft hadrons, and may affect the\nhydrodynamical simulations of shock waves mentioned in reference [206, 207].\n5. Fluctuations\n5.1. Fluctuations and the clustering of color sources\nL. Cunqueiro, E. G. Ferreiro and C. Pajares\nWe present our results on multiplicity and pT fluctuations at LHC energies in the framework of\nthe clustering of color sources. In this approach, elementary color sources -strings- overlap forming\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n88\n\nclusters, so the number of effective sources is modified. We find that the fluctuations are proportional\nto the number of those clusters.\n\nNon-statistical event-by-event fluctuations in relativistic heavy ion collisions have been\nproposed as a probe of phase instabilities near de QCD phase transition. The transverse\nmomentum and the multiplicity fluctuations have been measured at SPS and RHIC energies.\nThese fluctuations show a non-monotonic behavior with the centrality of the collision: they\ngrow as the centrality increases, showing a maximum at mid centralities, followed by a\ndecrease at larger centralities. Different mechanisms have been proposed in order to explain\nthose data. Here, we will apply the clustering of color sources. In this approach, color\nstrings are stretched between the colliding partons. Those strings act as color sources of\nparticles which are successively broken by creation of qq\u0304 pairs from the sea. The color strings\ncorrespond to small areas in the transverse space filled with color field created by the colliding\npartons. If the density of strings increases, they overlap in the transverse space, giving rise\nto a phenomenon of string fusion and percolation [65]. Percolation indicates that the cluster\nsize diverges, reaching the size of the system. Thus, variations of the initial state can lead to\na transition from disconnected to connected color clusters. The percolation point signals the\nonset of color deconfinement.\nThese clusters decay into particles with mean transverse momentum and mean\nmultiplicity that depend on the number of elementary sources that conform each cluster,\nand the area occupied by the cluster. In this approach, the behavior of the pT [166] and\nmultiplicity [167] fluctuations can be understood as follows: at low density, most of the\nparticles are produced by individual strings with the same transverse momentum < pT >1\nand the same multiplicity < \u03bc1 >, so fluctuations are small. At large density, above the critical\npoint of percolation, we have only one cluster, so fluctuations are not expected either. Just\nbelow the percolation critical density, we have a large number of clusters formed by different\nnumber of strings n, with different size and thus different < pT >n and different < \u03bc >n so the\nfluctuations are maximal.\nThe variables to measure event-by-event pT fluctuations are \u03c6 and F pT , that quantify the\ndeviation of the observed fluctuations from statistically independent particle emission:\ns\n< Z2 > p 2\n\u2212 <z >,\n(34)\n\u03c6=\n<\u03bc>\nP i\nz j is defined for each event,\nwhere zi = pT i \u2212 < pT > is defined for each particle and Zi = Nj=1\nand\nq\n< p2T > \u2212 < pT >2\n\u03c9data \u2212 \u03c9random\nF pT =\n, \u03c9=\n.\n(35)\n\u03c9random\n< pT >\nMoreover, in order to measure the multiplicity fluctuations, the variance of the multiplicity\ndistribution scaled to the mean value of the multiplicity has been used. Its behavior is similar\nto the one obtained for \u03a6(pT ), used to quantify the pT -fluctuations, suggesting that they are\nrelated to each other. The \u03a6-measure is independent of the distribution of number of particle\n\n\f89\nSPS\n\n4\n\n-\n\nT\n\nFp %\n\n-\n\n\u03a3 2 (n )/<n >\n\nHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n6\n\nRHIC\n\n3.5\n\nLHC\n\n5\n\n\u03b4y=1.5\n\n3\n4\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1.5\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nFigure 70: F pT at LHC.\n\n350\n\n400\nNpar\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\nNpar\n\nFigure 71: Scaled variance on negatively\ncharged particles at, from up to down, LHC,\nRHIC and SPS.\n\nsources if the sources are identical and independent from each other.

Note that the increase of\nthe energy essentially shifts the maximum position to a lower number of participants [166].\nIn Fig. 71 we show our values for the scaled variance of negatively charged particles at SPS,\nRHIC and LHC energies.\nSummarizing: the pT and multiplicity fluctuations are due in our approach to the different\nmean < pT > and mean multiplicities of the clusters, and they depend essentially on the\nnumber of clusters. In other words, a decrease in the number of effective sources leads to\na decrease of the fluctuations.\n5.2. Fluctuations of particle multiplicities from RHIC to LHC\nG. Torrieri\nWe define an observable capable of determining which statistical model, if any, governs freezeout in very high energy heavy ion collisions such as RHIC and LHC. We calculate this observable for\nK/\u03c0 fluctuations, and show that it should be the same for RHIC and LHC, as well as independent of\ncentrality, if the Grand-Canonical statistical model is appropriate and chemical equilibrium applies.\nWe describe variations of this scaling for deviations from this scenario, such as light quark chemical\nnon-equilibrium, strange quark over-saturation and local (canonical) equilibrium for strange quarks.\n\nParticle yield fluctuations are a promising observable to falsify the statistical model and\nto constrain its parameters (choice of ensemble, strangeness/light quark chemical equilibrium)\n[212]. The uncertainities associated with fluctuations, however, warrant that care be taken to\nchoose a fluctuation observable.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n90\n\nFor instance, volume fluctuations could be originating from both initial state effects and\ndynamical processes, and are not well understood. Their effect has to be factored out from\nmultiplicity fluctuations data. One way to do this is to concentrate on fluctuations of particle\nratios, where volume factors out event by event [213]\nE\nD\nE D\n(\u2206N2 )2\n(\u2206N1 )2\nh\u2206N1 \u2206N2 i\n+\n\u2212\n2\n.\n(36)\n\u03c32N1/N2 =\nhN1 i hN2 i\nhN1 i2\nhN2 i2\n\nThis, however, introduces an average hadronization volume dependence through the N1,2\nterms (two in the denominator, one in the numerator of Eq. 36).\nThis feature allows us to perform an invaluable consistency chech for the statistical\nmodel, since the volume going into the ratio fluctuations must, for consistency, be the same as\n1i 2\nthe volume going into the yields. Thus, observables such as dhN\ndy \u03c3 N1 /N2 should be strictly\nindependent of multiplicity and centrality, as long as the statistical model holds and the\nphysically appropriate ensemble is Grand Canonical.\nWe propose doing this test, at both RHIC and LHC, using the corrected variance\ndN1 dyn\n1\n\u03bd\n(37)\n\u03a8N\n=\nN1 /N2\ndy N1/N2\ndyn\n1 /N2\n\nwhere \u03bdN\n\nis theoretically equal to the corrected mixed variance [214]\ndyn\n1 /N2\n\n\u03bdN\n=\n\ndyn\n)2\n1 /N2\n\n= (\u03c3N\n\nhN1 (N1 \u2212 1)i\n2\n\nhN1 i\n\n+\n\n2\n= \u03c32N1 /N2 \u2212 (\u03c3Poisson\nN1 /N2 ) =\n\nhN2 (N2 \u2212 1)i\n2\n\nhN2 i\n\n\u22122\n\nhN1 N2 i\nhN1 i hN2 i\n\n(38)\n\n1\nSHAREv2.X [170] provides the possibility of calculating all ingredients of \u03a8N\nfor\nN1 /N2\nany hadrons, incorporating the effect of all resonance decays, as well as chemical\n\u2212\n\u2212\n(non)equilibrium. The calculation for \u03a8\u03c0K \u2212 /\u03c0\u2212 , as well as \u03a8\u03c0K \u2212 /\u03c0\u2212 is shown in Fig. 72. These\nspecies were chosen because their correlations (from resonance decays, N \u2217 \u2192 N1 N2 ), which\nwould need corrections for limited experimental acceptance, are small.\nEquilibrium thermal and chemical parameters are very similar at RHIC and the LHC(the\nbaryo-chemical potential will be lower at the LHC, but it is so low at RHIC that the difference\n1\nis not experimentally detectable). Thus, \u03a8N\nN1 /N2 should be identical, to within experimental\nerror, for both the LHC and RHIC, over all multiplicities were the statistical model is thought\nto apply.\nAccording to [168], chemical conditions at freeze-out deviate from equilibrium, and\nreflect the higher entropy contect and strangeness per entropy content of the early deconfined\nphase through an over-saturated phase space occupancy for the light and strange quarks\n1\n(\u03b3 s > \u03b3q > 1). If this is true, than \u03a8N\nshould still be independent of centrality for a given\nN1 /N2\nenergy range, but should go markedly up for the LHC from RHIC, because of the increase in\n\u03b3q and \u03b3 s .

High transverse momentum observables and jets\n6.1. Jet quenching parameter q\u0302 from Wilson loops in a thermal environment\nD. Antonov and H. J. Pirner\nThe gluon jet quenching parameter is calculated in SU(3) quenched QCD within the stochastic\nvacuum model. At the LHC-relevant temperatures, it is defined by the gluon condensate and the\nvacuum correlation length. Numerically, when the temperature varies from T c = 270 MeV to the inverse\nvacuum correlation length \u03bc = 894 MeV, the jet quenching parameter rises from zero to 1.1 GeV2 /fm.\n\nAt LHC energies, radiative energy loss is the dominant mechanism of jet energy loss in\nthe quark-gluon plasma.

To this end, we have used the stochastic vacuum model [217] at T > T c ,\nwhere T c = 270 MeV is the deconfinement temperature. This model incorporates the gluon\ncondensate which, together with the vacuum correlation length, defines the jet quenching\nparameter. This is different from the results obtained within perturbative QCD [218] and\nconformal field theories [216], where q\u0302 \u221d T 3 .\nThe hierarchy of scales in our problem is \u03bc\u22121 \u226a L\u22a5 \u226a \u03b2 \u226a Lk , where \u03b2 is the inverse\ntemperature, and \u03bc = 894 MeV is the inverse vacuum correlation length. Due to the x4 periodicity at finite temperature, the contour depicted in Fig. 73 effectively splits into\nsegments whose extensions along the 3rd and the 4th axes are \u03b2. Furthermore, due to the\nshort-rangeness of gluonic correlations, which fall off at the vacuum correlation length, the\ndominant contribution to q\u0302 stems from self-interactions of individual segments. We have also\ncalculated the contribution stemming from the correlations of neighboring segments, which\nturns out to be parametrically (and numerically) suppressed by the factor e\u2212\u03bc/T .

We applied KKP and AKK fragmentation functions. Our jet fragmentation study shows,\nthat hadron ratios at high pT depend on quark contribution mostly and less on the gluonic one. This\nfinding can be seen in jet-energy loss calculations, also. We display the suppression pattern on different\nhadron ratios in PbPb collisions at LHC energies.\n\nThe precision of pQCD based parton model calculations was enhanced during the last\ndecade. The calculated spectra allow to make predictions not only for the hadron yields, but\nfor sensitive particle ratios and nuclear modifications. For the calculation of particle ratios\nnew fragmentation functions are needed not only for the most produced light mesons, but for\nprotons also. From the experimental point of view one requires identified particle spectra by\nRHIC and LHC. Especially the ALICE detector has a unique capability to measure identified\nparticles at highest transverse momenta via \u010cherenkov detectors. The \u03c0\u00b1 /K \u00b1 and K \u00b1 /p( p\u0304)\nratios can be measured up to 3 GeV/c and 5 GeV/c respectively.\nHere we calculate hadron ratios in our next-to-leading order pQCD improved parton\nmodel based on Ref. [221] with intrinsic transverse momenta, determined by the expected\nc.m. energy evolution along the lines of Ref. [221]. The presented ratios are based on \u03c0, K\nand p spectra which were calculated by AKK fragmentation functions [14]. First we compare\ncalculated particle ratios to the data of the STAR collaboration measured in AuAu collisions\n\u221a\nat s = 200 AGeV RHIC energy [222, 223].

Kaidalov and K. Tywoniuk\nUsing a final state interaction model which describes the data on these two observables, at RHIC,\nwe make predictions at the LHC \u2013 using the same cross-section and p\u22a5 -shift. The increase in the\nmedium density between these two energies (by a factor close to three) produces an increase of the\nfixed p\u22a5 \u03c00 suppression by a factor 2 at large p\u22a5 and of v2 by a factor 1.5.\n\n6.3.1. \u03c00 fixed p\u22a5 suppression Final state interaction (FSI) effects have been observed in\nAA collisions. They are responsible of strangeness enhancement, J/\u03c8 supression, fixed p\u22a5\nsupression, azimuthal asymmetry, ... Is it the manifestation of the formation of a new state\nof matter or can it be described in a FSI model with no reference to an equation of state,\nthermalization, hydrodynamics, ... ? We take the latter view and try to describe all these\nobseervables within a unique formalism : the well known gain and loss differential equations.\nWe assume [225] that, at least for particles with p\u22a5 larger than < p\u22a5 >, the interaction with\nthe hot medium produces a p\u22a5 -shift \u03b4p\u22a5 towards lower values and thus the yield at a given p\u22a5\nis reduced. There is also a gain term due to particles produced at p\u22a5 + \u03b4p\u22a5 . Due to the strong\ndecrease of the p\u22a5 -distributions with increasing p\u22a5 , the loss is much larger than the gain.\nAsuming boost invariance and dilution of the densities in 1/\u03c4 due to longitudinal expansion,\nwe obtain\n\u03c4dN\u03c00 (b, s, p\u22a5 )\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= \u2212\u03c3N(b, s) N\u03c00 (b, s, p\u22a5 ) \u2212 N\u03c00 (b, s, p\u22a5 + \u03b4p\u22a5 )\n(40)\nd\u03c4\n\n\f95\n\nv2\n\nRAA\n\nHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n1\n\n0.45\nMid-central \u03c00 PHENIX (13%-26%)\n\n0.4\n0.35\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n\n10-1\n\n0.15\n\nCentral \u03c0 0 PHENIX (0-10%)\n0.1\n\nSuppression @ RHIC\nOne-jet @ LHC\nTwo-jet @ LHC\n\n\u03c00\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n50\np [GeV/c]\nT\n\n0.05\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\npT [GeV/c]\n\nFigure 76: From up to down: RHIC initial, Figure 77: v2 for \u03c00 at RHIC (lower curve) and\n2 LHC initial, RHIC final, LHC FSI, LHC LHC (upper curve).\nFSI+shadowing.\nHere N \u2261 dN/dyd 2 s is the transverse density of the medium and N\u03c00 the corresponding\none of the \u03c00 [226].

(40) at small \u03c4 describes\nan interaction at the partonic level. Indeed, here the densities are very large and the hadrons\nnot yet formed. At later times the interaction is hadronic. Most of the effect takes place in\nthe partonic phase. We use a single (effective) value of \u03c3 for all values of the proper time \u03c4.\nThe results at RHIC and LHC are given in Fig. 76. At LHC only shadowing [226] has been\nincluded in the initial state. The suppression is given by the dashed line. It coincides with RAA\nfor p\u22a5 large enough \u2013 when shadowing and Cronin efffects are no longer present. The LHC\nsuppression is thus a factor of two larger than at RHIC.\n\n6.3.2.

Wang\nWe study the evolution and saturation of the gluon distribution function in the quark-gluon plasma\nas probed by a propagating parton and its effect on the computation of the jet quenching or transport\nparameter q\u0302. For hard probes, this evolution at small x = Q2s /6ET leads to a jet energy dependence of\nq\u0302\n\nWithin the picture of multiple parton scattering in QCD, the energy loss for an energetic\nparton propagating in a dense medium is dominated by induced gluon bremsstrahlung.\nTaking into account of the non-Abelian Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference,\nthe radiative parton energy loss [228],\n\u03b1 s Nc\nq\u0302R L2 ,\n(42)\n\u2206E =\n4\nis found to depend on the jet transport or energy loss parameter q\u0302 which describes the averaged\ntransverse momentum transfer squared per unit distance (or mean-free-path). Here R is the\ncolor representation of the propagating parton in S U(3).\nThe transport parameter q\u0302R experienced by a propagating parton can be defined in terms\nof the unintegrated gluon distributions \u03c6k (x, q2T ) of the color sources in the quark-gluon\nplasma,\nZ \u03bc2 2 Z\nq2T\nd qT\n4\u03c02CR\ndx\u03b4(x\n\u2212\n\u03c1\n)\u03b1 s (q2T )\u03c6(x, q2T ),\n(43)\nq\u0302R = 2\n\u2212\n+\n2\n2p hk i\nNc \u2212 1 0 (2\u03c0)\nwhere hk+ i is the average energy of the color sources and \u03c6(x, q2T ) is the corresponding average\nunintegrated gluon distribution function per color source.

(43) at small x \u223c q2T /6ET . For a large\npath length, the typical total momentum transfer, q\u0302L, which will set the scale of the process,\nis also large. These scales lead to the evolution of the gluon distribution function. In the\nmedium, this evolution may be modified due to the interaction of the radiated gluons with\nthermal partons. However, since the medium effects are of the order of \u03bcD << T , we neglect\nthose at hard scales. Given that both the scale and the rapidity are large, we describe the\nthe (linear) vacuum evolution in the double logarithmic approximation (DLA) [229].

The square (triangle) marks the value of q\u0302 for thermal particle at T = 0.4 GeV (T = 0.6\nGeV). Significant corrections to the energy dependence are expected at low energy which\nshould approach their thermal value at E = 3 T .\n\nthermal gluon distribution function at a scale \u03bc2 = T 2 is determined via the hard thermal loop\napproximation and it is used as an initial condition for the evolution. As in vacuum, the\ngrowth of the gluon distribution function leads to saturation which tame this growth for scales\n\u03bc2 < Q2s . The saturation scale is estimated from the linearly evolved distribution. The details\nof the computation can be found in [230].\nThe evolution leads to a jet energy dependence of the transport parameter that is stronger\nthan any power of logarithmic dependence. The saturation effect also gives rise to a nontrivial length dependence of the jet transport parameter. These two features are shown in\nFigure 78, where we compute the transport parameter for T = 0.4 GeV (RHIC) and T = 0.6\nGeV (LHC). In both cases, the energy dependence of q\u0302 is significant, leading to a factor of 2\ndifference between jets of 20 and 200 GeV. This difference is larger for small jet path lengths.\nThe computation also shows that q\u0302 grows as the path length decreases. Both dependences\ntranslate into different amount of radiative energy loss Eq. (42). Let us note, however, that the\nderivation of Eq. (42) assumes a constant q\u0302; thus, the relation between the radiative energy\nloss and the transport parameter should be revisited for an energy/length dependent q\u0302.\n6.5.

Right: RCP (pT ) for Pb\u2013Pb collisions\n\u221a\nat sNN = 5.5 TeV.\n\njet suppression in RHIC and LHC experiments thus must correctly account for the dynamics of the\nmedium's constituents.\n\nHeavy flavor suppression is considered to be a powerful tool to study the properties of a\nQCD medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions [234]. The suppression results\nfrom the energy loss of high energy partons moving through the plasma [235]. Therefore, the\nreliable computations of heavy quark (collisional and radiative) energy loss mechanisms are\nessential for the reliable predictions of jet suppression.\nHowever, currently available heavy quark radiative energy loss studies suffer from one\ncrucial drawback: The medium induced radiative energy loss is computed in a QCD medium\nconsisting of randomly distributed but static scattering centers (\"static QCD medium\").\nWithin such approximation, the collisional energy loss is exactly zero, which is contrary to\nthe recent calculations [236] that showed that the collisional contribution is important and\ncomparable to the radiative energy loss. Due to this, it became necessary to obtain the heavy\nquark radiative energy loss in a dynamical QCD medium, and to test how good is the static\napproximation in these calculations.\nIn this proceeding, we report on a first important step, the calculation of heavy\nquark radiative energy loss in an infinite and time-independent QCD medium consisting of\ndynamical constituents. By comparing with the static medium calculation this permits us to\nqualitatively assess the importance of dynamical effects on radiative energy loss.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n100\n\nWe compute the medium induced radiative energy loss for a heavy quark to first (lowest)\norder in number of scattering centers. To compute this process, we consider the radiation\nof one gluon induced by one collisional interaction with the medium. In distinction to the\nstatic case, we take into account that the collisional interactions are exhibited with dynamical\n(moving) medium partons. To simplify the calculations, we consider an infinite QCD medium\nand assume that the on-shell heavy quark is produced at time x0 = \u2212\u221e, i.e. we consider\nthe Bethe-Heitler limit. The calculations were performed by using two Hard-Thermal Loop\napproach, and are presented in [237]. As the end result, we obtained a closed expression for\nthe radiative energy loss in dynamical QCD medium. This result allows us to compare the\nradiative energy loss in dynamical and static QCD medium, from which we can observe two\nmain differences. First, there is an O(15%) decrease in the mean free path which increases\nthe energy loss rate in the dynamical medium by O(20%). Second, there is a change in the\nshape and normalization of the emitted gluon spectrum. This second difference leads to an\nadditional significant increase of the heavy quark energy loss rate and of the emitted gluon\nradiation spectrum by about 50% for the dynamical QCD medium. The numerical results are\nbriefly discussed below.\nu,d\n\n2\n\n1.8\nc\n\nDEDYN\nrad\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n\u0080 1.8\nDESTAT\nrad\n\n1.75\nDEDYN\nrad\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\nSTAT\nDErad\n1.7\n\n1.6\n\nb\n\n1.65\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nE @TeVD\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n3\nM @GeVD\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFigure 80: Left panel: Ratio of the fractional radiative energy loss in dynamical and static\nmedia for charm quarks as a function of initial quark energy E. Right panel: Asymptotic\nvalue of the radiative energy loss ratio for high energy quarks as a function of their mass, with\nmarks indicating the light, charm and bottom quarks. For the parameter values, see [237].\nLeft panel of the Fig. 80 shows the energy loss ratio between dynamical and static media\nfor charm quark under the LHC conditions. We see that the ratio is almost independent of\nthe momentum p of the fast charm quark, saturating at \u2243 1.75 above p & 100 GeV and being\neven somewhat larger at smaller momenta. The dynamical enhancement persists at constant\nlevel to the largest possible charm quark energies. Therefore, we can conclude that there is\nno quark energy domain where the assumption of static scatterers in the medium becomes a\nvalid approximation. Further, the mass of the fast quark plays only a minor role for its energy\nloss. The right panel in Fig. 80 shows the asymptotic energy loss ratio for very high energy\nquarks as a function of the quark mass. While the dynamical enhancement is largest for light\nquarks, the difference between light and bottom quarks is only about 15%, and b quarks still\nsuffer about 70% more energy loss in a dynamical medium than in one with static scattering\ncenters.\nIn summary, we obtained an important qualitative conclusion that the constituents\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n101\n\nof QCD medium can not be approximated as static scattering centers in the energy loss\ncomputations.

Note that this prediction\ndepends on knowledge of the medium. In the present calculation, the medium evolution is\nlikewise predicted and has to be confirmed before the suppression can be tested. Note further\nthat the calculation is only valid where hadron production is dominated by fragmentation and\nthat it cannot be generalized to the suppression of jets since the requirement of observing a\nhard hadron leads to showers in which the momentum flow is predominantly through a single\nparton. This is not so for jets in which the momentum flow is shared on average among several\npartons (which requires a different framework).\nWe describe the soft medium evolution by the boost-invariant hydrodynamical model\ndiscussed in [31] where the initial conditions for LHC are computed from perturbative\nQCD+saturation [74]. Our calculation for the propagation of partons through the medium\nfollows the BDMPS formalism for radiative energy loss using quenching weights [232].\nDetails of the implementation can be found in [238].\nThe probability density P(x0 , y0 ) for finding a hard vertex at the transverse position\nr0 = (x0 , y0 ) and impact parameter b is given by the normalized product of the nuclear profile\nfunctions. We compute the energy loss probability P(\u2206E)path for any given path from a vertex\nthrough the medium by evaluating the line integrals\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nd\u03be q\u0302(\u03be).\nd\u03be \u03be q\u0302(\u03be) and hq\u0302Li(r0 , \u03c6) =\n\u03c9c (r0 , \u03c6) =\n0\n\n0\n\nAlong the path where we assume the relation\n\nq\u0302(\u03be) = K * 2 * \u01eb 3/4 (\u03be)(cosh \u03c1 \u2212 sinh\u03c1 cos \u03b1)\nbetween the local transport coefficient q\u0302(\u03be), the energy density \u01eb and the local flow rapidity \u03c1\nas given in the hydrodynamical model. The angle \u03b1 is between flow and parton trajectory. We\nview the constant K as a tool to account for the uncertainty in the selection of \u03b1 s and possible\nnon-perturbative effects increasing the quenching power of the medium (see [238]) and adjust\nit such that pionic RAA for central Au-Au collisions at RHIC is described. The result for LHC\nis then an extrapolation with K fixed.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n102\n\nUsing the numerical results of [232], we obtain P(\u2206E; \u03c9c , R)path for \u03c9c and R = 2\u03c92c /hq\u0302Li.\nFrom this distribution given a single path, we can define the averaged energy loss probability\ndistribution P(\u2206E)iT AA by averaging over all possible paths, weighted with the probability\ndensity P(x0 , y0 ) for finding a hard vertex in the transverse plane.\nWe consider all partons as absorbed whose energy loss is formally larger than their\ninitial energy. The momentum spectrum of produced partons is calculated in LO pQCD.\nThe medium-modified perturbative production of hadrons is obtained from the convolution\nX\nAA\u2192 f +X\n2\nd\u03c3AA\u2192h+X\n=\nd\u03c3vac\n\u2297 hP(\u2206E)iT AA \u2297 Dvac\nmed\nf \u2192h (z, \u03bcF )\nf\n\n2\nwith Dvac\nf \u2192h (z, \u03bcF ) the fragmentation function.

On quite general grounds, we expect a rise of RAA with pT for any energy\nloss model in which the energy loss probability does not strongly depend on the initial parton\nenergy as more of the shift in energy becomes accessible (see [238]). The detailed form of\nthe rise is then sensitive to the form of P(\u2206E)iT AA .\n6.8. Nuclear suppression of jets and RAA at the LHC\nG. Y. Qin, J. Ruppert, S. Turbide, C. Gale and S. Jeon\nThe nuclear modification factor RAA for charged hadron production at the LHC is predicted from\njet energy loss induced by gluon bremsstrahlung. The Arnold, Moore, and Yaffe [239\u2013241] formalism\nis used, together with an ideal hydrodynamical model [31].\n\nWe present a calculation of the nuclear modification factor RAA for charged hadron\n\u221a\nproduction as a function of pT in Pb+Pb collisions at sNN = 5.5 TeV in central collisions at\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n103\n\nmid-rapidity at the LHC. The net-energy loss of the partonic jets is calculated by applying the\nArnold, Moore, and Yaffe (AMY) formalism to calculate gluon bremsstrahlung [239\u2013241].\nThe details of jet suppression relies on an understanding of the nuclear medium, namely\nthe temperatures and flow profiles that are experienced by partonic jets while they interact\nwith partonic matter at T \u2265 T c . Our predictions use a boost-invariant ideal hydrodynamic\nmodel with initial conditions calculated from perturbative QCD + saturation [31, 74]. It\nis emphasized that the reliability of this work hinges on the validity of hydrodynamics at\nthe LHC. It has been verified that RAA for \u03c00 production as a function of pT as obtained\nin the same boost-invariant ideal hydrodynamical model adjusted to Au+Au collisions at\n\u221a\nsNN = 0.2 TeV [31] is in agreement with preliminary data from PHENIX in central collisions\nat RHIC (and the result is very close to the one obtained in 3D hydrodynamics presented\nin [242]). In AMY the strong coupling constant \u03b1 s is a direct measure of the interaction\nstrength between the jet and the thermalized soft medium and is the only quantity not\nuniquely determined in the model, once the temperature and flow evolution is fixed by the\ninitial conditions and subsequent hydrodynamical expansion. We found that assuming a\nconstant \u03b1 s = 0.33 describes the experimental data in most central collisions at RHIC. It is\nconjectured that \u03b1 s should not be changed very much at the LHC since the initial temperature\nis about twice larger than the one at RHIC whereas \u03b1 s is only logarithmically dependent on\ntemperature. We present results for \u03b1 s = 0.33 and 0.25.\nFor details of the calculation of nuclear suppression, we refer the reader to [242]. The\nextension to the LHC once the medium evolution and \u03b1 s are fixed is straightforward. The\ninitial jets are produced with an initial momentum distribution of jets computed from pQCD\nin the factorization formalism including nuclear shadowing effects. The probability density\nPAA (~r\u22a5 ) of finding a hard jet at the transverse position ~r\u22a5 in central A+A collisions is given\nby the normalized product of the nuclear thickness functions, PAA (~r\u22a5 ) = T A (~r\u22a5 )T A (~r\u22a5 )/T AA\nand is calculated for Pb+Pb collisions. The evolution of the jet momentum distribution\nP j (p, t) = dN j (p, t)/dpdy in the medium is calculated by solving a set of coupled rate equations\nwith the following generic form,\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nZ\nj\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\nd\u0393ajb (p + k, p)\nd\u0393ab (p, k) \uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\ndP j (p, t) X\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa ,\n=\ndk \uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0Pa (p + k, t)\n\u2212 P j (p, t)\n\uf8fb\ndt\ndkdt\ndkdt\nab\nj\n\nwhere d\u0393ab (p, k)/ddt is the transition rate for the partonic process j \u2192 a + b which depends on\nthe temperature and flow profiles experienced by the jets traversing the medium. The hadron\nh /d2 p dy is obtained by the fragmentation of jets after their passing through\nspectrum dNAA\nT\nthe medium.

Perturbative jet energy loss mechanisms: learning from RHIC, extrapolating to LHC\nS. Wicks and M. Gyulassy\nIn many recent papers, collisional energy loss has been found to be of the same order as\nradiative energy loss for parameters applicable to the QGP at RHIC. As the temperature and jet\nenergy dependence of collisional energy loss differs from that of radiative loss, the interpretation of the\nresults at RHIC affects our extrapolation to predictions for the LHC. We present results from a hybrid\ncollisional plus radiative model, combining DGLV radiative loss with HTL-modified collisional loss,\nincluding the fluctuation spectrum for small numbers of collisions and gluons emitted.\n\nCollisional energy loss is an essential component of the physics of high momentum\npartonic jets traversing the quark-gluon plasma [243, 244]. If we do not properly understand\nthe energy loss mechanisms that are important at RHIC, then we cannot accurately extrapolate\nin medium density and jet energy to make predictions for the LHC.\nWHDG [244] made a first attempt at including both collisional and DGLV radiative\nenergy loss processes. A simple model of the collisional energy loss was used: leading\nlog average loss with a Gaussian distribution around this average, the width given by\nthe fluctuation-dissipation theorem. For the short lengths of interest in the QGP fireball\n(\u2248 0 \u2212 6fm), we expect a jet to undergo only a small number of significant collisions. But\nthe fluctuation spectrum for this will be different than that implemented in the WHDG\nmodel: instead, the distinctly non-Gaussian fluctuation in energy loss in 0,1,2,3 collisions\nis necessary. We present here results and predictions from an improved hybrid radiative plus\ncollisional energy loss model which include a full evaluation of these fluctuations.\nA significant uncertainty in the model is the use of a fixed strong coupling constant. In\nWHDG, a canonical value \u03b1 s = 0.3 was used, validated by the fitting of the pion RAA (pT ) at\nRHIC. Here, for a fixed density dNg /dy = 1000, an increased coupling \u03b1 s = 0.4 is necessary to\ndo the same. In fact, if the collisional component of the energy loss is neglected completely,\na further increased coupling of \u03b1 s = 0.5 would be necessary, as shown in the left-hand side of\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n105\n\nFig. 83. Both values, while large, are still in a possible perturbative kinematical region, and\nare evaluated with medium densities constrained by the total entropy and multiplicity of the\ncollision.\nIs it possible to differentiate between these two scenarios: one including collisional loss,\nthe other neglecting it but increasing the coupling to compensate? Staying with the most\nsimple observables, single particle inclusives in central collisions, we have three dependences\nto test: the dependence on medium density, jet energy and jet mass. The first is tested by the\npredicted increased density of the medium to be produced at the LHC (consistency between\nthe left plot and either the central or right plot in Fig. 83). The very high momentum reach\navailable for measurements involving gluon and light quark jets is valuable for the second\n(radiative versus radiative plus collisional in the central and right hand plots of Fig. 83), and\nthe separate detection of D and B mesons gives us the third (as in Fig. 84). All these together\nwill provide very strong constraints on the energy loss models, even before considering\nobservables beyond the single-particle inclusives.\n\nFigure 83: RAA for pions for RHIC (left) and two possible densities at LHC (central and\nright). The main result, the hybrid radiative plus collisional energy loss model for \u03b1 s = 0.4, is\ncompared to a radiative energy loss alone model for an increase value of the strong coupling.\nThe increased range in momentum available at the LHC enables the different slopes of the\ntwo models to be seen.\nThere are still significant uncertainties in the energy loss model. The most important\nkinematic region for evaluation of both the collisional and radiative energy losses are for\nenergy and momentum transfers from the medium greater than \u03bcD , the Debye mass. This is\nthe region in which we know the least about the physics of the QGP: beyond the HTL region,\nbut before a region of vacuum gluon exchange, especially if processes close to the light-cone\nof the exchanged gluon are important (as it is for collisional energy loss). This can produce\nan uncertainty of \u2248 50% for the average collisional loss, which may not be correlated with an\nuncertainty in the radiative loss. Such large uncertainties affect both the explanation of RHIC\ndata and the extrapolation to the LHC.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n106\n\nFigure 84: RAA for observable products of heavy quark jets at RHIC (electrons - left) and two\npossible densities at the LHC (D and B mesons - right). There is considerable uncertainty\nin the perturbative production of c and b jets. This shows up in the results for electrons\nat RHIC in the large uncertainty band, \u00b10.1 or greater - as the ratio of c to b jets is very\nuncertain. However, the uncertainty in D and B meson RAA s is small (approximately \u00b10.02) the different slopes on the individual spectra have very little effect on the meson RAA results.\n6.10. Jet evolution in the Quark Gluon Plasma\nH. J. Pirner, K. Zapp, J. Stachel, G. Ingelman and J. Rathsman\nJet evolution is calculated in the leading log approximation. We solve the evolution equation\nfor the branching of gluons in vacuum, using a triple differential fragmentation function D(x, Q2 , p2\u22a5 ).\nAdding an extra scattering term for evolution in the quark gluon plasma we investigate the influence\nof the temperature of the plasma on the differential cross section of partons dN/d ln(1/x) in a jet of\nvirtuality Q2 = (90 GeV)2 . Due to scattering on the gluons in the plasma the multiplicity increases, the\ncentroid of the distribution shifts to smaller x values and the width narrows.\n\nThe evolution equation for the transition of a parton i with virtuality Q2 and momentum\n(1, k\u22a5 ) into a parton j with momentum (z, p\u22a5 ) can be constructed in leading logarithmic\napproximation [245]. In a dense medium they are modified due to the possibility that the\nparton is scattered. The scatterings change the transverse momentum of the leading fast parton\nby giving it ~q\u22a5 kicks, but they do not change the mass scale or virtuality of the fast parton.\nThe lifetime of a virtual parton can be estimated as d\u03c4 = E/Q20 (dQ2 /Q2 ) using the uncertainty\nprinciple (E is the parton energy and Q20 is the infrared scale). Evolving along a straight line\npath in a homogeneous plasma with a density of gluons ng we obtain a modified evolution\nequation\nj\n\nQ\n\n2\n\n\u2202Di (z, Q2 , ~p\u22a5 )\n\n=\n\u2202Q2\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \u0012\nZ\n\u0013\n2q\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 j z 2\nQ20\n\u03b1 s (Q2 ) 1 du r\nz\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\u22a5 \uf8ec\n2 d ~\n2\uf8f7\n2\n\uf8f7\nPi (u, \u03b1 s (Q ))\n\u03b4\uf8ecu(1 \u2212 u)Q \u2212\n\u2212 q\u22a5 \uf8f7\uf8f8 Dr , Q , ~p\u22a5 \u2212 ~q\u22a5\n2\u03c0\n\u03c0 \uf8ed\n4\nu\nu\nz u\n+ S (z, Q2 , ~p\u22a5 )\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n107\n\nwith the scattering term S (z, Q2 , p\u22a5 )\nS (Q2 , ~p\u22a5 ) =\n!\nZ\nZ\ni\nd\u03c3ri h j\nzEng 1\nq2\u22a5\nj\n2\n2\n2\nDr (w, Q , ~p\u22a5 \u2212 w~q\u22a5 ) \u2212 Dr (z, Q , ~p\u22a5 ) \u03b4 w \u2212 z \u2212\n.\ndw d ~q\u22a5 2\n2mg E\nd ~q\u22a5\nQ20 z\n\nThe scattering term includes the probability for scattering into and out of the p\u22a5 bin as well as\nthe energy loss of the parton.

The width of the distribution, however,\nbecomes smaller. It remains to be studied in vacuum how the choice of the parameters can be\noptimized to the LEP data, for simplicity the above curves are calculated for \u039bQCD = 250 MeV.\nIt is well known that in the evolution equation the QCD scale parameter may well be adjusted.\nConcerning the effects of the plasma, the form of the cross section and its dependence on\n\u03b1 s (Q2 ) has to be further investigated. The results look encouraging and serve as an analytical\nmodel with which numerical Monte Carlo calculations can be compared.\nThere has been a calculation of jet evolution in the modified leading log\napproximation [248] which has produced similar shapes for the differential multiplicity\ndistribution. The advantage of our calculation is that it takes into account the scattering term\nexplicitly and therefore gives results which depend on the plasma properties. The equation\ncan also be used to investigate the p\u22a5 broadening of the parton in the medium, since our input\nfunction contains the transverse momentum as an extra variable explicitly.\nNote added in proof: The calculation described in the text has been undergoing several\nchanges during the last months. Therefore we refer to a forthcoming publication where these\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n108\n\nimprovements are included.\n6.11. Pion and Photon Spectra at LHC\nS. Jeon, I. Sarcevic and J. Jalilian-Marian\nUsing simple modification of jet fragmentation function that is tuned to reproduce the RHIC \u03c00\ndata, we had previously predicted photon production at RHIC which is confirmed by recent PHENIX\ndata. Using the same parameter set, we predict hight pT pion and prompt photon spectra in Pb-Pb\ncollisions at LHC.\n\nIn perturbative QCD, the inclusive cross section for pion production in a hadronic\ncollision is given by:\nZ\nX\nd3 \u03c3\u0302i j\u2192cX\nd3 \u03c3 \u221a\nF i (xa , Q2 )F j (xb , Q2 )Dc/\u03c0 (z, Q2f )E \u03c0\nE \u03c0 3 ( s, p\u03c0 ) = dxa dxb dz\nd p\u03c0\nd3 p\u03c0\ni, j\n\nwhere i and j label hadrons or nuclei and a, b, c label partons.\nIn heavy-ion collisions, one needs to include nuclear effects. In our model, we take the\nparton distribution function for a nucleus to be\nF a/A (x, Q2 , bt ) = T A (bt ) S a/A (x, Q2 ) F a/N (x, Q2 )\n\nwhere T A is the nuclear thickness function and S a/A is the shadowing function (we use EKS98\nparametrization).\nUnfortunately, the interaction of parton-medium cannot be calculated within perturbative\nQCD, but need to be modeled. The purpose of our model [249\u2013251] is to be as simplistic as\npossible so that the essential nature of the energy loss process can manifest. To achieve this\ngoal, we modify the fragmentation function in the following way [252]\nN\nX\n2\nPa (n)zan D0c/\u03c0 (zan , Q2 ) + hna iz\u2032a D0g/\u03c0 (z\u2032a , Q20 ),\nzDc/\u03c0 (z, \u2206L, Q ) =\nn=0\n\nzan\n\nz\u2032a\n\nwhere = z/(1 \u2212 n\u01eba /E T ), = zE T /\u01eba , N is the maximum number of collisions for which\nzan \u2264 1 and D0c/\u03c0 is the hadronic fragmentation function. The second term comes from the\nemitted gluons each having energy \u01eba on the average. The average number of scatterings\nwithin a distance \u2206L is hna i = \u2206L/\u03bba . We take \u03bba = 1 fm and \u2206L = RA . Pa (n) is the Poisson\ndistribution function with hni = (\u2206L/\u03bba ).\n\u221a\nThe three energy loss models we use are \u2206E = 1.0 GeV (Const) \u2206E = E LPM E (LPM)\nand \u2206E = \u03baE (BH) per collision. For RHIC, BH (Bethe-Heitler) gives best description of \u03c00\ndata, and predictions for direct photons using the same energy loss is recently found to be in\nagreement with PHENIX data [253]. Within the same framework we present our predictions\nfor the LHC.\nPhotons can be either produced during the primary collision or via fragmentation. The\nreason that the photon RAA behaves qualitatively differently than that of \u03c00 is because in this\nenergy range, the direct photons that come out of the primary collisions dominate over the\nfragmentation photons. Therefore the effect of energy loss is substantially reduced compared\nto the pion case.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n7\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.9\n\n3\n3\n3\n\n3\n\nConst : \u03b5=1.0 GeV\nLPM : ELPM=0.351 GeV\nBH : \u03ba=6.1 %\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n3\n\n6\n\n(Ed \u03c3AA/d p)/(NcollEd \u03c3PP/d p)\n\n10\n\n1.1\nPP\nConst : \u03b5=1.0 GeV\nLPM : ELPM=0.351 GeV\nBH : \u03ba=6.1 %\n\n3\n\n2\n\n(1/Ncoll)Ed \u03c3/d p (pb/GeV )\n\n10\n\n109\n\n1/2\n\ns = 5500 GeV\nEKS98 Shadowing\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\n1/2\n\ns = 5500 GeV\nEKS98 Shadowing\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\n20\n25\npT (GeV)\n\n30\n\n35\n\n0\n\n40\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n25\npT (GeV)\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nFigure 86: Neutral pion spectrum and RAA at LHC.

We also predict the upper limit of transverse momentum broadening of J/\u03c8 and \u03a5\nproduction as a function of Npart at the LHC energy.\n\nNuclear transverse momentum broadening of heavy vector bosons (\u03b3\u2217 , W/Z, and heavy\nquarkonia) is defined as a difference between the averaged transverse momentum square\nmeasured in nuclear collisions and that measured in collisions of free nucleons,\n,Z\nZ\nd\u03c3(D)\nd\u03c3NN\nAB\n2\n2\n2\n2 2\ndq2T\n.\n(45)\n\u2206hqT iAB \u2261 hqT iAB \u2212 hqT iNN \u2248 dqT qT\n2\ndqT\ndq2T\nSince single scattering is localized in space, the broadening is a result of multiple parton\nscattering, and is a good probe for nuclear medium properties. Because the mass scale of the\nvector bosons is much larger than the characteristic momentum scale of the hot medium, the\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n110\n\nbroadening is likely dominated by double partonic scattering as indicated in equation (45).\nThe broadening caused by the double scattering can be systematically calculated in terms of\nhigh twist formalism in QCD factorization [254, 255].\nAt the LHC energies, a lot W and Z, and J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 will be produced. Most reconstructed\nW/Z bosons will come from their leptonic decays. Their transverse momentum broadening is\na result of purely initial-state multiple scattering. By calculating the double scattering effect,\nwe obtain [255, 256]\n4\u03c02 \u03b1 s (MZ ) 2 1/3\n4\u03c02 \u03b1 s (MW ) 2 1/3\n\u03bbW A , \u2206hq2T iZpA =\n\u03bbZ A\n(46)\n3\n3\nfor hadron-nucleus collisions. The \u03bb2 A1/3 in equation (46) was introduced in [254] as a\nratio of nuclear four parton correlation function over normal parton distribution. The \u03bb\nis proportional to the virtuality or transverse momentum of soft gluons participating in the\ncoherent double scattering. For collisions with a large momentum transfer, Q, the \u03bb2 should\nbe proportional to ln(Q2 ) [256] and the saturation scale Q2s if the active parton x is small. By\n\u221a\nfitting Fermilab E772 Drell-Yan data, it was found that \u03bb2DY \u2248 0.01 GeV2 at s = 38.8 GeV\n[255]. From the \u03bb2DY , we estimate the value of \u03bb2 for production of a vector boson of mass\nMV at the LHC energy as\n!\nln(MV2 ) MV /5500 \u22120.3\n2\n2\n\u03bbV (LHC) \u2248 \u03bbDY\n,\n(47)\nln(Q2DY ) QDY /38.8\n\u221a\nwhere we used Q2s \u221d 1/x\u03b4 with \u03b4 \u2248 0.3 [33] and sNN = 5500 GeV for the LHC heavy ion\ncollisions. For an averaged QDY \u223c 6 GeV, we obtain \u03bb2W/Z \u2248 0.05 at the LHC energy. We\ncan also apply our formula in equation (46) to the broadening in nucleus-nucleus collisions\nby replacing A1/3 by an effective medium length Leff . We calculate Leff in Glauber model\nwith inelastic nucleon-nucleon cross section \u03c3in\nNN = 70 mb at the LHC energy.

The pairs produced in heavy ion collisions can\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n111\n\nhave final-state interactions before bound quarkonia could be formed. We found [256] that\nwith both initial- and final-state double scattering, the broadening of heavy quarkonia is close\nto 2C A /C F times the Drell-Yan broadening in proton-nucleus collision, which is consistent\nwith existing data [257]. If all soft gluons of heavy ion beams are stopped to form the\nhot dense medium in nucleus-nucleus collisions, final-state interaction between the almost\nstationary medium and the fast moving heavy quarks (or quarkonia) of transverse momentum\nqT is unlikely to broaden the qT spectrum, instead, it is likely to slow down the heavy quarks\n(or quarkonia) [256]. From equation (47). we obtain \u03bb2J/\u03c8 \u2248 0.035, and \u03bb2\u03a5 \u2248 0.049 at the LHC\nenergy; and we predict the maximum broadening for J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 production (upper set curves)\nin figure 88.\n6.13. Nuclear modification factors for high transverse momentum pions and protons at LHC\nW. Liu, B.-W. Zhang and C. M. Ko\nThe inclusion of conversions between quark and gluon jets in a quark-gluon plasma\n(QGP) via both elastic qg \u2194 gq and inelastic qq\u0304 \u2194 gg reactions [258] has recently been\nshown to give a plausible explanation for the observed similar p/\u03c0+ and p\u0304/\u03c0\u2212 ratios at large\n\u221a\ntransverse momenta in both central Au+Au and pp collisions at sNN = 200 GeV [223].\nExtending this study to LHC, we predict the nuclear modification factor for both protons\nand pions as well as their ratios at large transverse momenta in central Pb+Pb collisions at\n\u221a\nsNN = 5.5 TeV.\nFor the dynamics of formed QGP at LHC, we assume that it evolves boost invariantly\nin the longitudinal direction but with an accelerated transverse expansion. Specifically, its\nvolume expands in the proper time \u03c4 according to V(\u03c4) = \u03c0R2 (\u03c4)\u03c4c, where R(\u03c4) = R0 +\na(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40 )2 /2 is the transverse radius with an initial value R0 = 7 fm, the QGP formation\ntime \u03c40 = 0.5 fm/c, and the transverse acceleration a = 0.1 c2 /fm. Starting with an initial\ntemperature T 0 = 700 MeV, the time dependence of the temperature is obtained from entropy\nconservation, leading to the critical temperature T C = 170 MeV at proper time \u03c4C = 8.4 fm/c.\nFor a quark or gluon jet moving through the QGP, the rate for the change in its mean transverse\nmomentum hpT i is given by dhpT i/d\u03c4 \u2248 \u03b3(hpT i, T )hpT i. The drag coefficient \u03b3(hpT i, T ) is\ncalculated from two-body scattering with thermal quark and gluon masses and the strong\nQCD coupling \u03b1 s (T ) = g2 (T )/4\u03c0 \u2248 2.1\u03b1pert (T ) from lattice calculations [259]. To take into\naccount the contribution from two-body radiative scattering, we multiply the calculated drag\ncoefficient by a factor KE \u223c 2, which is determined from fitting the light meson nuclear\nmodification factor at RHIC. Because of conversion scatterings, the quark or gluon jet can\nalso be converted to a gluon or quark jet with a rate given by corresponding collisional widths,\nwhich are also calculated by using the strong QCD coupling constant and multiplying with\nKC = KE \u223c 2.\nUsing initial transverse momentum spectra of minijet gluons, quarks, and anti-quarks\nobtained by multiplying those from the PYTHIA for pp collisions at same energy with the\nnumber of binary collisions, we simulate the propagation of jets in the QGP using the Monte\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\np+p\n\nPb+Pb\n0.6\n\n112\n\n1/2\n\ns\n\n0.8\n\n=5.5 TeV\n\nPb+Pb +conv.\n\np\n\nNN\n\nPb+Pb w/o conv.\n\np/\n\nR\n\nAA\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n5\n\n10\n\np (GeV)\nT\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\np (GeV)\nT\n\nFigure 89: (Color online) Left window: Nuclear modification factor RAA for \u03c0+ (solid line)\n\u221a\nand proton (dashed line) in central Pb+Pb collisions at sNN = 5.5 TeV.

Resulting charged pion and proton spectra from freezeout quark and gluon jets are obtained via the AKK fragmentation functions [14]. In the left\nwindow of figure 89, we show predicted nuclear modification factor RAA for \u03c0+ and p at\n\u221a\nlarge transverse momenta in central Pb+Pb collisions at sNN = 5.5 TeV at LHC. It is seen\nthat the RAA of pions increases from 0.18 at pT = 5 GeV/c to 0.4 at pT = 40 GeV/c due to\na smaller drag coefficient at large transverse momenta. The RAA of protons has a similar\nbehavior, but its value is smaller because of stronger suppression of gluon than quark jets.\nThe resulting p/\u03c0+ ratio, shown by the solid line in the right window of figure 89, approaches\nthat in pp collisions at same energy when the transverse momenta become very large. At\nlower transverse momenta, the p/\u03c0+ ratio in Pb+Pb collisions remains, however, smaller than\nthat in pp collisions, which is different from that in heavy ion collisions at RHIC as a result of\nthe larger ratio of gluon to quark jets at LHC. Without conversions between quark and gluon\njets, the p/\u03c0+ ratio decreases by a factor of two as shown by the dotted line.\n6.14. Quenching of high-pT hadrons: Alternative scenario\nB .Z. Kopeliovich, I. K. Potashnikova and I. Schmidt\nA new scenario, alternative to energy loss, for the observed suppression of high-pT hadrons\nobserved at RHIC is proposed. In the limit of a very dense medium crated in nuclear collisions\nthe mean free-path of the produced (pre)hadron vanishes, and and the nuclear suppression, RAA is\ncompletely controlled by the production length. The RHIC data are well explained in a parameter free\nway, and predictions for LHC are provided.\n\nThe key assumption of the energy loss scenario for the observed suppression of high-pT\nhadrons in nuclear collisions is a long length of the quark hadronization which ends up in the\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n113\n\nmedium. This has got no justification so far and was challenged in [260].\nThe quark fragmentation function (FF) was calculated in Born approximation in [261]:\nBorn (z)\n\u2202D\u03c0/q\n1\n\u221d 4 (1 \u2212 z)2 ,\n(48)\n2\n\u2202k\nk\nwhere k and z are the transverse and fractional longitudinal momenta of the pion. One can\nrewrite this in terms of the coherence length lc = z(1 \u2212 z)E/k2 , where E is the jet energy. Then,\nBorn (z)/\u2202l \u221d (1 \u2212 z), is l independent.

The induced energy loss playing a minor role is added as well. S (lc, z) is the\nSudakov suppression caused by energy conservation.

Expectations from AdS/CFT for Heavy Ion Collisions at the LHC\nH. Liu, K. Rajagopal and U. A. Wiedemann\nWe summarize results obtained by use of the AdS/CFT correspondence for jet quenching and\nquarkonium dissociation, and we discuss the resulting expectations for heavy ion collisions at the\nLHC.\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence maps nonperturbative problems in a large class of strongly\ncoupled non-abelian gauge theories onto calculable problems in dual gravity theories. The\ngravity dual of Quantum Chromodynamics is not known. However, one finds many\ncommonalities amongst the quark-gluon plasmas in large classes of strongly coupled nonabelian thermal gauge theories, independent of their significantly differing microscopic\ndegrees of freedom and interactions. Since these results are generic and do not seem to depend\non microscopic features of the theory such as its particle content at weak coupling, one may\nexpect that they are shared by QCD. Where this can be tested against QCD lattice results,\nthe qualitative agreement is fair (see Ref. [216]). However, many measurements in heavy ion\ncollisions involve strong coupling and real-time dynamics, where lattice QCD results are not\navailable or in their infancy. The practitioner faces the uncomfortable choice of calculating\neither with inappropriate (e.g. perturbative) techniques in QCD, or using appropriate strong\ncoupling techniques but working in a class of gauge theories that may not include QCD itself\nand seeking universal commonalities. We report on two results from the latter approach.\n6.15.1. Jet quenching In QCD itself, the jet quenching parameter q\u0302 has not been calculated\nin the strong coupling regime. For the N = 4 SYM theory, it has been calculated for large\nt'Hooft coupling \u03bb = g2 Nc by use of the AdS/CFT correspondence [263]:\n\u03c03/2 \u0393(3/4) \u221a 3\n\u03bbT .\n(52)\nq\u0302S Y M =\n\u0393(5/4)\nIf one relates this to QCD by fixing Nc = 3 and \u03b1S Y M = .5, then q\u0302S Y M = 32.7 T 3 = 4.5 GeV2 /fm\nat T = 300 MeV. This shows that a medium characterized by a momentum scale T can give\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n115\n\nrise to an apparently large quenching parameter, significantly larger than T 3 . For a certain\ninfinite class of theories with gravity dual, one finds that the quenching parameter scales with\nthe square root of the entropy density [263]. Assuming that QCD follows this systematic, one\nfinds\nr\nr\nsQCD\n47.5\nq\u0302N=4 =\nq\u0302N=4 \u2243 0.63 q\u0302N=4 .\n(53)\nq\u0302QCD =\nsN=4\n120\nIn extrapolating from RHIC to LHC, we assume that the change in q\u0302 is dominated by\nthe change in T 3 , see eq. (52). In the presence of expansion, the relevant temperature\nT at RHIC and at the LHC must be compared at the same time \u03c4. This can be seen,\ne.g., in a Bjorken\nexpansion scenario in which T (\u03c4) = T 0 (\u03c40 /\u03c4)1/3 . The time-averaged\nRL\nq\u0302 = (2/L2 ) 0 d\u03c4 \u03c4 q\u0302(\u03c4), which determines parton energy loss and which is the quantity that\nhas been extracted by comparison with RHIC data, is then q\u0302 \u221d (2\u03c40 /L)T 03 = (2\u03c4/L)T (\u03c4)3 ,\nindependent of the reference time \u03c40 .

Quarkonium suppression In lattice QCD, the temperature dependent potential\nbetween a heavy quark and anti-quark has been calculated as a function of their separation\nL. At finite temperature, this potential is screened above a length L s \u223c 0.5/T (see references\nin [264]). These studies indicate that the J/\u03a8 dissociates at a temperature between 1.5 T c and\n2.5 T c . For N = 4 SYM theory, one finds L s \u223c 0.277/T . In contrast to QCD, the calculation in\ntheories with gravity dual can be done also for heavy quark-antiquark pairs which are moving\nwith a velocity pv through the heat bath. One finds that the screening length decreases with\nincreasing \u03b3 = 1/(1 \u2212 v2 ) [264]:\n\u221a\n\u221a\nL s (v, T ) \u2243 L s (0, T )/ \u03b3 \u2212\u2192 T diss (v) \u2243 T diss (0)/ \u03b3 .\n(54)\nSo, bound states with a dissociation temperature T diss (v) will survive if at rest in a medium at\ntemperature T if T diss (0) > T . Yet, they will dissociate if they move sufficiently fast through\nthe medium, such that T diss (v) < T . LHC data may test this prediction, depending on the\nquarkonium formation mechanism. Let us consider three possibilities for the latter: i) A parent\nquark (c or b) propagates through the medium but the quarkonium forms later, outside the\nmedium. ii) As in (i) but with a parent gluon. iii) A quarkonium bound state forms (from either\na parent quark or gluon) and propagates through the medium. These three scenarios can be\ndiscriminated as follows: i) The nuclear modification factor of quarkonium is the same as that\nof open charm or beauty, which are known to be dominated by quark parents. It is the same for\nall quarkonium bound states. ii) The nuclear modification factor of quarkonium is the same\nas that of light hadrons, which at the LHC are dominated by gluon parents. Again, all bound\nstates are equally suppressed. iii) The nuclear modification factor will differ for different\nbound states, since they will dissociate for different values of the transverse momentum pT .\nThe hierarchy in the pT -dependence of the quarkonium suppression pattern would test (54).\nFor example, \u03a5 (or J/\u03a8) suppression could set in only above some pT while \u03a5\u2032 (or \u03a8\u2032 ) are\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n116\n\nsuppressed even at low pT . Details of the formation mechanism cancel in ratios like \u03a5/\u03a5\u2032 ,\nmaking the pT -dependent pattern predicted by (54) visible as long as the quarkonia form in\nthe medium.\n6.16. High-pT observables in PYQUEN model\nI. P. Lokhtin, A. M. Snigirev and C. Yu. Teplov\nPredictions of PYQUEN energy loss model for high-pT observables at the LHC are discussed.\nNuclear modification factors and elliptic flow for hard jets and high-pT hadrons, medium-modified jet\nfragmentation function, pT -imbalance for dimuon tagged jets, high-mass dimuon and secondary J/\u03c8\nspectra are calculated for PbPb collisions.\n\n\u221a\nIn this paper, the various high-pT observables in PbPb collisions at sNN = 5.5A TeV\nare analyzed in the frame of PYQUEN partonic energy loss model [265]. The pseudorapidity\n\u00b1\ncuts for jets |\u03b7jet | < 3, charged hadrons |\u03b7h | < 2.5 and muons |\u03b7\u03bc | < 2.5 were applied. The\njet energy was determined here as the total transverse\nenergy of the final particles around the\np\n2\ndirection of a leading particle inside a cone R = \u2206\u03b7 + \u2206\u03c62 = 0.5 (\u03c6 is the azimuthal angle).\n6.16.1. Nuclear modification factors for jet and high-pT hadrons The nuclear modification\nfactor is defined as a ratio of particle yields in AA and pp collisions normalized on the number\nof binary nucleon-nucleon collisions. Figures 91 and 92 show pT -dependences of nuclear\nmodification factors for inclusive charged hadrons (in central PbPb events triggered on jets\njet\nwith E T > 100 GeV) and for jets respectively. The number of entries and the statistical errors\ncorrespond to the estimated event rate for one month of LHC run and a nominal integrated\nluminosity of 0.5 nb\u22121 [266]. The predicted hadron suppression factor slightly increases with\npT (> 20 GeV), from \u223c 0.25 at pT \u223c 20 GeV to \u223c 0.4 at pT \u223c 200 GeV. This behaviour\nmanifests the specific implementation of partonic energy loss in the model, rather weak\nenergy dependence of loss and the shape of initial parton spectra. Without event triggering\non high-E T jet(s), the suppression factor is stronger (\u223c 0.15 at 20 GeV and slightly increasing\nwith pT up to \u223c 0.3 at 200 GeV). The predicted jet suppression factor (due to partial gluon\nbremsstrahlung out of jet cone and collisional loss) is about 2 and almost independent on jet\nenergy. It is clear that the measured jet nuclear modification factor will be very sensitive to\nthe fraction of partonic energy loss carried out of the jet cone.\n6.16.2. Medium-modified jet fragmentation function The \"jet fragmentation function\" (JFF),\nD(z), is defined as the probability for a given product of the jet fragmentation to carry a\nfraction z of the jet transverse energy. Figure 93 shows JFF's in central PbPb collisions with\nand without partonic energy loss.

Indeed, final jet transverse momentum (which is the denominator in definition of\nz) decreases in this case without an influence on the numerator of z and, as a consequence,\nthe effect on JFF softening reduces, while the integral jet suppression factor becomes larger.\nThus a novel study of the softening of the JFF and suppression of the absolute jet rates can be\ncarried out in order to differentiate between various energy loss mechanisms (\"small-angular\"\nradiative loss versus \"wide angular\" and collisional loss) [267].\nOther correlation measurements which also can be useful extracting information about\nmedium-modified jets are jet shape broadening and jet quenching versus rapidity [268] and\nmonojet-to-dijet ratio versus dijet acoplanarity [269].\n6.16.3. Azimuthal anisotropy of jet quenching The azimuthal anisotropy of particle spectrum\nis characterized by the second coefficient of the Fourier expansion of particle azimuthal\ndistribution, elliptic flow coefficient, v2 . The non-uniform dependence of medium-induced\npartonic energy loss in non-central heavy ion collisions on the parton azimuthal angle \u03c6 (with\nrespect to the reaction plane) is mapped onto the final hadron spectra [270, 271]. Figure 95\njet\nshows the calculated impact parameter dependence of v2 coefficient for jets with E T > 100\nGeV and for inclusive charged hadrons with pT > 20 GeV/c in PbPb events triggered on jets.\nThe absolute values of v2 for high-pT hadrons is larger that one's for jets by a factor of \u223c 2 \u2212 3.\njet\nHowever, the shape of b-dependence of vh2 and v2 is similar: it increases almost linearly with\nthe growth of b and becomes a maximum at b \u223c 1.6RA (where RA is the nucleus radius). After\nthat, the v2 coefficients drop rapidly with increasing b.\n6.16.4. PT -imbalance in dimuon tagged jet events An important probe of medium-induced\npartonic energy loss in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is production of a single jet\nopposite to a gauge boson such as \u03b3\u22c6 /Z 0 decaying into dileptons. The advantage of such\nprocesses is that the mean initial transverse momentum of the hard jet equal to the mean\ninitial/final transverse momentum of boson, and the energy lost by the parton can be estimated\nfrom the observed pT -imbalance between the leading particle in a jet and the lepton pair.\nFigure 96 shows the difference between the transverse momentum of a \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 pair from \u03b3\u22c6 /Z 0\n\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\ndecay, pT , and five times the transverse energy of the leading particle in a jet (since the\naverage fraction of the parent parton energy carried by a leading hadron at these energies\n\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 jet\nis z \u2248 0.2) for minimum bias PbPb collisions [272]. The cuts, pT , E T > 50 GeV/c were\napplied. Despite the fact that the initial distribution is smeared and asymmetric due to initialstate gluon radiation, hadronization effects, etc., one can clearly see the additional smearing\nand the displaced mean and maximum values of the pT -imbalance due to partonic energy loss.\nThe pT -imbalance between the \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 pair and a leading particle in a jet is directly related to\nthe absolute value of partonic energy loss, and almost insensitive to the form of the angular\nspectrum of the emitted gluons and to the experimental jet energy resolution [272].\n\n\f0.1\n\n0.09\n0.08\n\ndN/d(\u2206pT)\n\nv2\n\nHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\ncharged hadrons\njets\n\n0.01\n\n0.009\n0.008\n\n0.07\n\n\u03b3 */Z0(\u2192\u03bc+\u03bc-) + jet\nPbPb, no energy loss\nPbPb, PYQUEN\nenergy loss\n\n0.007\n\n0.06\n\n0.006\n\n0.05\n\n0.005\n\n0.04\n\n0.004\n\n0.03\n\n0.003\n\n0.02\n\n0.002\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0\n0\n\n119\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nb, fm\n\nFigure 95: The impact parameter dependence\njet\nv2\n\nof elliptic flow coefficients\nfor jets\njet\nwith E T > 100 GeV (black circles) and vh2\nfor inclusive charged hadrons with pT >\n20 GeV/c (open circles) in PbPb events\ntriggered on jets.\n\n0\n-100-80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80 100\nlead\n\n\u2206pT=pT(\u03bc+\u03bc-) - 5ET , GeV\n\nFigure 96: The distribution of the difference\nbetween the transverse momentum of a \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\npair and five times the transverse energy of\nthe leading particle in a jet in PbPb collisions\nwith (dashed histogram) and without (solid\nhistogram) energy loss.\n\n6.16.5. High-mass dimuon and secondary J/\u03c8 spectra While the study of inclusive high-pT\njet production in heavy ion collisions provides information on the response of created medium\nto gluons and light quarks, the study of open heavy flavour production gives corresponding\ninformation on massive colour charges. The open charm and bottom semileptonic decays are\nthe main sources of muon pairs in the resonance-free high invariant mass region, 10 < M\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 <\n70 GeV/c2 [266]. Other processes which also carry information about medium-induced\nbottom rescattering are secondary J/\u03c8 production from the B meson decay [273, 274] and\nmuon tagged b-jets [275]. Figures 97 and 98 show the spectra of high-mass \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 pairs and the\npT -distributions of the secondary J/\u03c8's respectively, for minimum bias PbPb collisions with\n\u03bc\nand without energy loss of bottom quarks (pT > 5 GeV/c). A factor of around 2.5 suppression\nfor bb\u0304 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 and 2 for secondary J/\u03c8 would be clearly observed over the initial state nuclear\nshadowing expected in this kinematic region [273, 274].\n6.17.

Pantuev\nPredictions for some experimental physical observables in nucleus-nucleus collisions at LHC\nenergies are presented. I extend the previous suggestion that the retarded jet absorption, at RHIC by\ntime about 2.3 fm/c, in opaque core is a natural explanation of many experimental data. At LHC\nthis time should be inversely proportional to the square root of parton hard scattering density, thus\nabout 2 times shorter than at RHIC, or 1.2 fm/c.

I calculate nuclear modification factor RAA ,\nazimuthal anisotropy parameter v2 , jet suppression IAA for the away side jet and its dependence versus\nthe reaction plane orientation. The system under consideration is Au+Au at central rapidities.\n\nIn previous paper [276] I propose a simple model, driven by experimental data, to\nexplain the angular dependence of the nuclear modification factor RAA at high transverse\nmomentum in and out the reaction plane. I introduce one free parameter L \u2243 2.3 fm to\ndescribe the the thickness of the corona area with no absorption wich was adjusted to fit\nthe experimental data of Au-Au collisions at centrality 50-60%. The model uses realistic\nWoods-Saxon nuclear density distribution and nicely describes the RAA dependence for all\ncentrality classes. I extract the second Fourier component amplitude, v2 , for high pT particle\nazimuthal distribution and found v2 should be at the level of 11-12% purely from the geometry\nof the collision with particle absorption in the core. At that time I made a prediction for\nRAA in Cu+Cu collisions at 200 GeV which, as later was found, is in very good agreement\nwith experimental data. Physical interpretation of the parameter L could be that it is actually\nretarded jet absorption caused by the plasma formation time T = L/c \u2243 2.3 fm/c at RHIC,\nor at least non-trivial response of strongly interacting plasma to fast moving color charge.\nFrom experimental data at 62 GeV center-of-mass beam energy I found that this time\nshould be about 3.5 fm/c. This follows the expectation on the significance of mean distance\nbetween the centers with mini jet production (hard scatterings) at particular beam energy. At\nLHC energy of about 5 TeV we expect \u2243 1.2 fm/c formation time [277].\nIn figure 99 I show predictions for RAA and IAA at central rapidities.

Hadrochemistry of jet quenching at the LHC\nS. Sapeta and U. A. Wiedemann\nWe point out that jet quenching can leave signatures not only in the longitudinal and transverse\nmultiplicity distributions, but also in the hadrochemical composition of the jet fragments. As a\ntheoretical framework, we use the MLLA+LPHD formalism, supplemented by medium-modified\nsplitting functions.\n\nIn heavy ion collisions at the LHC, the higher energies of produced jets will facilitate\ntheir separation from the soft background. The interactions of jets with the matter produced\nin these collisions is expected to modify both the longitudinal and transverse jet distributions.\nIn addition, we expect that these interactions affect also the hadrochemical composition of\njets.\nWithin current models of jet quenching, this may be expected, since color is transfered\nbetween the projectile and the medium - and a changed color flow in the parton shower can\nbe expected to change the hadronization. More generally, one may imagine that partonic\nfragments of the jet participate in hadronization mechanisms not available in the vacuum (such\nas a recombination mechanism, which depends on the density of recombination partners), or\nthat recoil effects kick components of the medium into the jet cone. Also, any exchange\nof quantum numbers between medium and jet (e.g. baryon number or strangeness) may be\nreflected in the hadrochemical composition. In the following, we consider a model which\ndoes not implement such mechanisms, but considers solely the enhanced parton splitting due\nto medium effects [278].\nTo calculate multiplicities of the identified hadrons we use the framework of\nModified Leading Logarithmic Approximation (MLLA) [279]. This perturbative approach\nsupplemented by the hypothesis of Local Parton-Hadron Duality (LPHD) was shown to\nreproduce correctly the single inclusive hadron spectra in jets both in e+ e\u2212 and pp/p p\u0304\ncollisions. It provides good description not only for the distributions of all charged particles\nbut also for the spectra of identified hadrons such as pions, kaons and protons [280, 281].\nMoreover, the dependence on jet opening angle can be implemented. The general form of the\nmultiplicity of hadrons of mass Mh in the jet of energy E jet and opening angle \u03b8c is given by\ndN h\n= KLPHD D(\u03be, E jet , \u03b8c , Mh , \u039b) ,\n(55)\nd\u03be\nwhere \u03be = ln 1/x and x = p/E jet is the fraction of the jet energy carried by the hadron h. The\nregularization scale \u039b is a parameter of the model.\nThe medium-modification of jets is formulated within the MLLA formalism [282] by\nenhancing the singular parts of the LO splitting functions by a factor 1 + fmed . This accounts\nfor the nuclear modification factor at RHIC when fmed is of the order of 1, and it provides a\nmodel for the distribution of subleading jet fragments.\nOne result of our studies is shown in Figure 101. We observe a significant difference\nof the K \u00b1 /\u03c0\u00b1 and p\u00b1 /\u03c0\u00b1 ratios of medium-modified (with fmed = 1) and 'standard' vacuum\nfragmenting jets.

The kaon\nmultiplicity was in adjusted by a strangeness suppression factor 0.73 as in [281].\n\nbackground is included in forming the ratio [278].\nThe precise numerical change of the hadrochemical composition, shown in Figure 101,\nis model-depement of course. We emphasize, however, that in our model, medium effects are\nimplemented on the partonic level only, and the hadronization mechanism remains unchanged.\nNevertheless, the observed change is significant. Thus, our model provides a first example for\nour expectation, that the hadrochemical composition of jets may be very fragile to medium\neffects, and provides additional information about the microscopic mechanism underlying jet\nquenching.\n6.19. GLV predictions for light hadron production and suppression at the LHC\nI. Vitev\nSimulations of neutral pion quenching in Pb+Pb reactions at s1/2 = 5.5 A.TeV at the LHC are\npresented to high transverse momentum pT . At low and moderate pT , we study the contribution\nof medium-induced gluon bremsstrahlung to single inclusive hadron production. At the LHC, the\nredistribution of the lost energy is shown to play a critical role in yielding nuclear suppression that\ndoes not violate the participant scaling limit. Energy loss in cold nuclear matter prior to the formation\nof the QGP is also investigated and shown to have effect on particle suppression as large as doubling\nthe parton rapidity density.\n\nPb+Pb collisions at the LHC represent the future energy frontier of QGP studies in heavy\nion reactions. Energy loss of jets in the final state is calculated in the GLV formalism [184].\nNumerical simulations follow the technique outlined in [283] and incorporate the Cronin\neffect [284]. We have explored the sensitivity of RAA (pT ) to the parton rapidity density in\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n124\n\ncentral nuclear reactions with dN g /dy \u2243 2000, 3000 and 4000. In this work we adhere to a\nmore modest two- to four-fold increase of the soft hadron rapidity density and emphasize that\nfuture measurements of jet quenching must be correlated to dN g /dy \u2248 (3/2)dN ch /dy [283,\n284] to verify the consistency of the phenomenological results. See left panel of Fig. 102.\nThe contribution of the bremsstrahlung gluons to low- and moderate-pT inclusive particle\nproduction at the LHC is shown to be significant. See right panel of Fig. 102.\nEnergy loss of jets in cold nuclear matter has not been considered before. Recent\ncalculations in the GLV approach show that, in contract to final-state energy loss, the\ncancellation of the bremsstrahlung in the initial-state is finite [285]. With \u2206E/E \u223cfew %, the\nobservable effect of the bremsstrahlung associated with the multiple soft scattering in nuclei\nis non-negligible even for very energetic partons in the nuclear rest frame. See left panel of\nFig. 103. At the LHC, in central Pb+Pb collisions, the effect of cold nuclear matter energy\nloss can be as large as doubling the parton rapidity density dN g /dy mainly due to reduced\nsensitivity in the final state.

Heavy-quark production from Glauber-Gribov theory at LHC\nI. C. Arsene, L. Bravina, A. B. Kaidalov, K. Tywoniuk and E. Zabrodin\nWe present predictions for heavy-quark production for proton-lead collisions at LHC energy 5.5\nTeV from Glauber-Gribov theory of nuclear shadowing. We have also made predictions for baseline\ncold-matter (in other words inital-state) nuclear effects in lead-lead collisions at the same energy that\nhas to be taken into account to understand properly final-state effects.\n\n7.3.1. Introduction In the Glauber-Gribov theory [21] nuclear shadowing at low-x is related\nto diffractive structure functions of the nucleon, which are studied experimentally at HERA.\nThe space-time picture of the interaction for production of a heavy-quark state on nuclei\nchanges from longitudinally ordered rescatterings at energies below the critical energy,\ncorresponding to x2 of an active parton from a nucleus becoming smaller than 1/mN RA , to the\ncoherent interaction of constituents of the projectile with a target nucleus at energies higher\nthant the critical one [295]. For production of J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 in the central rapidity region the\ntransition happens at RHIC energies. In this kinematical region the contribution of Glaubertype diagrams is small and it is necessary to calculate diagrams with interactions between\npomerons, which, in our approach, are accomodated in the gluon shadowing.

Experimental data are from [296].\nfor J/\u03c8-suppression in d+Au collisions at RHIC has been considered in Ref.

The gluon diffractive\ndistributions were taken from the most recent experimental parameterizations of HERA data\n[23]. The Schwimmer model was used to account for higher-order rescatterings.\n7.3.2. Heavy-quark production at the LHC We present predictions for the rapidity and\ncentrality dependence of the nuclear modification factor in proton-lead (p+Pb) collisions\n\u221a\nfor both J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 in Fig. 109 (the data on J/\u03c8 suppression at s = 200 GeV is taken\nfrom [296], where also a definition of the nuclear modification factor can be found). We\npredict a similar suppression for open charm, cc\u0304, and bottom, bb\u0304, as for the hidden-flavour\nparticles.

RAA (pt ) and RCP (pt ) of single muons from heavy quark and vector boson decays at the\nLHC\nZ. Conesa Del Valle, A. Dainese, H.-T. Ding, G. Mart\u00ednez and D. Zhou\nWe study the effect of heavy-quark energy loss on the nuclear modification factors RAA and RCP\n\u221a\nof the high-pt distribution of single muons in Pb\u2013Pb collisions at sNN =5.5 TeV. The energy loss\nof heavy quarks is calculated using the mass-dependent BDMPS quenching weights and taking into\naccount the decrease of medium density at large rapidity. Muons from W and Z decays, that dominate\nthe yield at high pt , can be used as a medium-blind reference that scales with the number of binary\ncollisions.\n\nThe PHENIX and STAR experiments at RHIC have measured a suppression, in central\nAu\u2013Au relative to pp collisions, of the high-pt yield of non-photonic electrons, which are\nassumed to come from semi-electronic decays of charm and beauty particles. This suppression\nis interpreted as an indication of a strong energy loss of c and b quarks in the medium formed\nin Au\u2013Au collisions. At the LHC, the nuclear modification factors RAA and RCP of the singlemuon inclusive pt distribution will be among the first measurements sensitive to heavy-quark\nenergy loss. Moreover, the very high pt domain (pt > 30 GeV/c) of the muon spectrum will\nbe dominated by muonic decays of electroweak boson W (mainly) and Z, that should be\nmedium-insensitive and follow binary scaling, thus making of the nuclear modification factor\na self-normalized observable.\nWe obtain the charm and beauty contributions to the muon spectrum from the NLO\npQCD calculation (MNR [297]) supplemented with the mass-dependent BDMPS quenching\nweights for radiative energy loss [294], quark fragmentation \u00e0 la Peterson and semi-muonic\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n133\n\n9\n\nRAA\n\n10\n\nPb-Pb, E loss, no cuts\nsolid: q=0\nshort-dash: q=25GeV 2/fm\nlong-dash: q=100GeV2/fm\n\n8\n\n10\n\n107\n\nt\n\nd\u03c3\u03bc/dp [pbGeV -1c]\n\ndecay with the spectator model.

Quarkonium production in coherent pp/AA collisions and small-x physics\nV. P. Gon\u00e7alves and M. V. T. Machado\nWe study the photoproduction of quarkonium in coherent proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus\ninteractions at the LHC. The integrated cross sections and rapidity distributions are estimated using\nthe Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formalism, which takes into account the parton saturation effects\nat high energies. Nuclear shadowing effects are also taken into account.\n\nIn this contribution we study the photoproduction of vector mesons in the coherent\npp/AA interactions at the LHC energies. The main advantage of using colliding hadrons\nand nuclear beams for studying photon induced interactions is the high equivalent photon\nenergies and luminosities that can be achieved at existing and future accelerators (for a review\nsee reference [300]). Consequently, studies of \u03b3p interactions at LHC could provide valuable\ninformation on the QCD dynamics at high energies. The basic idea in coherent hadron\ncollisions is that the total cross section for a given process can be factorized in terms of\nthe equivalent flux of photons of the hadron projectile and the photon-photon or photon-target\nproduction cross section. In exclusive processes, a certain particle is produced while the\ntarget remains in the ground state (or is only internally excited). The typical examples of\nthese processes are the exclusive vector meson production, described by the process \u03b3h \u2192 Vh\n(V = \u03c1, J/\u03a8, \u03a5). In the last years we have discussed this process in detail considering pp [301],\npA [302] and AA [301] collisions as an alternative to investigate the QCD dynamics at high\nenergies. Here, we revised these results and present for the first time our predictions for the \u03a5\nproduction.\nThe cross section for the photoproduction of a vector meson X in an ultra-peripheral\nhadron-hadron collision is given by\nZ \u221e\ndN\u03b3 (\u03c9)\n2\n\u03c3\u03b3h\u2192Xh (W\u03b3h\n),\n\u03c3(h1 h2 \u2192 h1 h2 X) =\nd\u03c9\nd\u03c9\n\u03c9min\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the photon energy and dN\u03b3 (\u03c9)/d\u03c9 is the equivalent flux of photons from a charged\nhadron. The total cross section for vector meson photoproduction is calculated considering\nthe color dipole approach, which is directly related with the dipole-target forward amplitude\nN. In the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formalism (see e.g. [303]), N encodes all the\ninformation about the hadronic scattering, and thus about the non-linear and quantum effects\nin the hadron wave function. In our analyzes we have used the phenomenological saturation\nmodel proposed in references [33, 304]. Nuclear effects are also properly taken into account.\nOur predictions for the rapidity distributions are presented in figure 113 and for the total\ncross section in table 6. The main uncertainties are the photon flux, the quark mass and the\nsize of nuclear effects for the photonuclear case. In addition, specific predictions for \u03c1 and\nJ/\u03a8 phoproduction in pA collisions can be found in reference [302]. The rates are very high,\nmostly for light mesons.

Heavy-Quark Kinetics in the QGP at LHC\nH. van Hees, V. Greco and R. Rapp\nWe present predictions for the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of D and B mesons,\nas well as of their decay electrons, in semicentral Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. Heavy quarks are\npropagated in a Quark-Gluon Plasma using a relativistic Langevin simulation with drag and diffusion\ncoefficients from elastic interactions with light anti-/quarks and gluons, including non-perturbative\nresonance scattering. Hadronization at T c is performed within a combined coalescence-fragmentation\nscheme.\n\nIn Au-Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) a surprisingly\nlarge suppression and elliptic flow of \"non-photonic\" single electrons (e\u00b1 , originating from\nsemileptonic decays of D and B mesons) has been found, indicating a strong coupling of\ncharm (c) and bottom (b) quarks in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP).\n\n9\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n136\n\nWe employ a Fokker-Planck approach to evaluate drag and diffusion coefficients for\nc and b quarks in the QGP based on elastic scattering with light quarks and antiquarks\nvia D- and B-meson resonances (supplemented by perturbative interactions in color nonsinglet channels) [305]. This picture is motivated by lattice QCD computations which\nsuggest a survival of mesonic states above the critical temperature, T c . Heavy-quark (HQ)\nkinetics in the QGP is simulated with a relativistic Langevin process [306]. Since the initial\ntemperatures at the LHC are expected to exceed the resonance dissociation temperatures,\nwe implement a \"melting\" of D- and B-mesons above T diss =2T c =360 MeV by a factor\n(1 + exp[(T \u2212 T diss )/\u2206])\u22121 (\u2206=50 MeV) in the transport coefficients.\nThe medium in a heavy-ion reaction is modeled by a spatially homogeneous elliptic\nthermal fireball which expands isentropically. The temperature is inferred from an ideal\ngas QGP equation of state with N f =2.5 massless quark flavors, with the total entropy\nfixed by the number of charged hadrons which we extrapolate to dNch /dy\u22431400 for central\n\u221a\nsNN =5.5 TeV Pb-Pb collisions. The expansion parameters are adjusted to hydrodynamic\nsimulations, resulting in a total lifetime of \u03c4fb \u22436 fm/c at the end of a hadron-gas QGP mixed\nphase and an inclusive light-quark elliptic flow of hv2 i=7.5%. The QGP formation time, \u03c40 , is\nestimated using \u03c40 T 0 =const (T 0 : initial temperature), which for semicentral collisions (impact\nparameter b\u22437 fm) yields T 0 \u2243520 MeV.\nInitial HQ pT spectra are computed using PYTHIA with parameters as used by the\nALICE Collaboration. c and b quarks are hadronized into D and B mesons at T c by\ncoalescence with light quarks [62]; \"left over\" heavy quarks are hadronized with \u03b4-function\nfragmentation. For semileptonic electron decays we assume 3-body kinematics [306].\nFig. 114 summarizes our results for HQ diffusion in a QGP in terms of RAA (pT )\nand v2 (pT ) at the quark, meson and e\u00b1 level for b=7 fm Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC\n(approximately representing minimum-bias conditions). Our most important findings are:\n(a) resonance interactions substantially increase (decrease) v2 (RAA ) compared to perturbative\ninteractions; (b) b quarks are much less affected than c quarks, reducing the effects in the\ne\u00b1 spectra; (c) there is a strong correlation between a large v2 and a small RAA at the quark\nlevel, which, however, is partially reversed by coalescence contributions which increase both\nv2 and RAA at the meson (and e\u00b1 ) level. This feature turned out to be important in the\nprediction of e\u00b1 spectra at RHIC; (d) the predictions for LHC are quantitatively rather similar\nto our RHIC results [306, 307], due to a combination of harder initial HQ-pT spectra with a\nmoderate increase in interaction strength in the early phases where non-perturbative resonance\nscattering is inoperative.\n7.7.

One seeks a measurement that may clearly\nfalsify one or both approaches; heavy quark jet suppression is one possibility. Stronglycoupled calculations, utilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence, have been applied to highpT jets in three ways [263, 308, 309]. We will focus on predictions from the AdS/CFT\nheavy quark drag model and compare them to pQCD predictions from the full radiative and\nelastic loss WHDG model and radiative alone WHDG model [244]. Comparisons between\nAdS/CFT models and data are difficult. First, one must accept the double conjecture of\nQCD\u2194SYM\u2194AdS/CFT. Second, to make contact with experiment, one must make further\nassumptions to map quantities such as the coupling and temperature in QCD into the SUGRA\ncalculation. For example, the AdS/CFT prediction for the heavy quark diffusion coefficient\n\u221a\nis D = 4/ \u03bb(/2\u03c0T ) [308], where \u03bb = g2S Y M Nc is the 't Hooft coupling. The \"obvious\" first\nsuch mapping [310] simply equates constant couplings, g s = gS Y M , and temperatures, T S Y M =\nT QCD . Using this prescription with the canonical Nc = 3 and \u03b1 s = .3 yields D \u2248 1.2(/2\u03c0T ).\nIt was claimed in [308] that D = 3(/2\u03c0T ) agrees better with data; this requires \u03b1 s \u2248 .05. An\n\"alternative\" mapping [310] equates the quark-antiquark force found on the lattice to that\ncomputed using AdS/CFT, giving \u03bb \u2248 5.5, and the QCD and SYM energy densities, yielding\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n138\n\nT S Y M = T QCD /31/4 .The medium density to be created at LHC is unknown; we will take the\nPHOBOS extrapolation of dNg /dy = 1750 and the KLN model of the CGC, dNg /dy = 2900, as\ntwo sample values.We will search for general trends associated with AdS/CFT drag (denoted\nhereafter simply as AdS/CFT) or pQCD as these uncertainties mean little constrains the\npossible normalizations of AdS/CFT RQ\nAA predictions for LHC.\n1\n\nCharm\n\nRAA(pT)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\nBottom\n\npQCD Rad+El, PHOBOS\npQCD Rad+El, KLN\nAdS/CFT D = 3, PHOBOS\nAdS/CFT D = 3, KLN\n\n0.4\n0.2\nO\n\n0\n\nO\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\npT (GeV)\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\npT (GeV)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 115: (a) Charm and bottom RAA (pT ) predictions with representative input parameters\nfor LHC.

(b) Ratio of charm to bottom RAA (pT ) bunches the two models\nfor a wide range of input parameters; the LHC should easily distinguish between the two\ntrends.\nAdS/CFT calculations of the drag on a heavy quark yield d pT /dt = \u2212\u03bcR Q pT =\n\u221a 2\n\u2212(\u03c0 \u03bbT S Y M /2mQ )pT [309], giving an average fractional energy loss of \u01ed = 1 \u2212exp(\u2212 dt\u03bcQ ).\nAsymptotic pQCD energy loss for heavy quarks in a static medium goes as \u01ed \u2248\n\u03baL2 q\u0302 log(pT /mQ )/pT , where \u03ba is a proportionality constant and L is the pathlength traversed\nby the heavy quark. Note that AdS/CFT fractional momentum loss is independent of\nmomentum while pQCD loss decreases with jet energy. The heavy quark production\nspectrum may be approximated by a slowly varying power law of index nQ (pT ) + 1, then\nnQ (pT ) . Since n (p ) is a slowly increasing function of momentum, we expect\nRQ\nQ T\nAA \u2248 (1 \u2212 \u01ed)\nRQ\n(p\n)\nto\ndecrease\nwhile\nRQ\nAA,S Y M T\nAA,pQCD(pT ) to increase as momentum increases. This\nbehavior is reflected in the full numerical calculations shown in Fig. 115 (a); details of the\nmodel can be found in [311].\nFor high suppression pQCD predicts nearly flat RQ\nAA , masking the difference between\nAdS/CFT and pQCD. One can see in Fig. 115 (b) that the separation of AdS/CFT\nand pQCD predictions is enhanced when the double ratio of charm to bottom nuclear\nmodification, Rcb (pT ) = RcAA (pT )/RbAA (pT ), is considered. Asymptotic pQCD energy loss\ngoes as log(mQ /pT )/pT , becoming insensitive to quark mass for pT \u226b mQ ; hence Rcb\npQCD \u2192\n1. Expanding the RAA formula for small \u01eb yields Rcb\npQCD (pT ) \u2248 1 \u2212 pcb /pT , where pcb =\n2\n\u03ban(pT )L log(mb /mc )q\u0302 and nc \u2248 nb = n. Therefore the ratio approaches unity more slowly for\nlarger suppression. This behavior is reflected in the full numerical results for the moderately\nquenched pQCD curves, but is violated by the highly oversuppressed q\u0302 = 100 curve. The\nAdS/CFT drag, however, is independent of pT .

This behavior is also reflected in the full numerical results shown in Fig. 115 (b), and so,\nremarkably, the pQCD and AdS/CFT curves fall into easily distinguishable bunches, robust\nto changes in input parameters. An estimate for the momentum after which corrections to\nthe above AdS/CFT drag formula are needed, \u03b3 > \u03b3c , found in the static string geometry is\n\u221a\n\u03b3c = 1/1 + (2mQ /T \u03bb) [312]. Since temperature is not constant we show the smallest speed\nlimit, using T (\u03c40 , ~x = ~0), and largest, from T c , represented by \"O\" and \"|,\" respectively. A\ndeviation of Rcb away from unity at LHC in year 1 would pose a serious challenge to the usual\npQCD paradigm. An observation of a significant increase in Rcb with jet momenta would\nimply that the current AdS/CFT picture is only applicable at low momenta, if at all. For a\ndefinitive statement to be made a p + Pb control run will be crucial.\n7.8. Thermal charm production at LHC\nB.-W. Zhang, C. M. Ko and W. Liu\nCharm production from an equilibrated quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in heavy\nion collisions at LHC is studied to the next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD [313].\nSpecifically, we consider the process q(g) + q\u0304(g) \u2192 c + c\u0304 and its virtual correction as well\nas the processes q(g) + q\u0304(g) \u2192 c + c\u0304 + g, and g + q(q\u0304) \u2192 c + c\u0304 + q(q\u0304). The amplitudes for\nthese processes are taken from Refs. [314\u2013317] using massless quarks and gluons, the QCD\ncoupling constant \u03b1 s (mc ) \u2248 0.37, and a charm quark mass mc = 1.3 GeV. The charm quark\nproduction rate in the QGP is then evaluated by integrating over the thermal quark and gluon\ndistributions in the QGP. \u221aBoth thermal quarks and gluons are taken to have thermal masses\ngiven by mq = mg = gT/ 6, where T is the temperature of the QGP and g is related to the\nthermal QCD coupling constant \u03b1 s (2\u03c0T ) = g2 /4\u03c0, which has values ranging from \u223c 0.23 for\nT = 700 MeV to \u223c 0.42 for T = 170 MeV.\n\u221a\nFor the dynamics of formed QGP in central Pb+Pb collisions at sNN = 5.5 TeV at\nLHC, we assume that it evolves boost invariantly in the longitudinal direction but with an\naccelerated transverse expansion. Specifically, its volume expands in the proper time \u03c4\naccording to V(\u03c4) = \u03c0R2 (\u03c4)\u03c4c, where R(\u03c4) = R0 + a(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c40 )2 /2 is the transverse radius with an\ninitial value R0 = 7 fm, the QGP formation time \u03c40 =0.2 fm/c, and the transverse acceleration\na = 0.1 c2 /fm. Starting with an initial temperature T 0 = 700 MeV, which gives an initial\nenergy density of about 50% higher than that predicted by the AMPT model [52] or the Color\nGlass Condensate [179], the time dependence of the temperature is obtained from entropy\nconservation, leading to the critical temperature T C = 170 MeV at proper time \u03c4C = 6.4 fm/c.\nThe initial number of charm pairs is taken to be dNcc\u0304 /dy = 20 at midrapidity, which is of\nsimilar magnitude as that estimated from initial hard nucleon-nucleon collisions based on the\nnext-to-leading order pQCD calculations.\nIn the left window of Fig. 116, we show the temperature dependence of the charm quark\npair production rates from the leading order (dashed line) and the next-to-leading order (solid\nline) with their ratio shown in the inset.

Dashed and solid lines are results from the leading order and next-to-leading order\ncalculations, respectively. The inset in left window gives the ratio of charm production rate in\nthe next-to-leading order to that in the leading order.\nleading order are of similar magnitude and both are appreciable at high temperatures. The\ntotal number of charm pairs as a function of the proper time \u03c4 in an expanding QGP produced\nat LHC is shown in the right window of Fig. 116. As shown by the dashed line, including only\nthe leading-order contribution from two-body processes increases the number of charm pairs\nby about 10% during the evolution of the QGP. Adding the next-leading-order contribution\nthrough virtual corrections to two-body precesses as well as the 2 \u2192 3 processes further\nincreases the charm quark pair number by about 25% as shown by the solid line. The charm\nquark pair number reaches its peak value at \u03c4 \u223c 2 fm/c and then deceases with the proper\ntime as a result of larger charm annihilation than creation rates when the temperature of the\nQGP drops. At the end of the QGP phase, it remains greater than both its initial value and the\nchemically equilibrium value of about 5 at TC = 170 MeV. The number of charm quark pairs\nproduced from the QGP would be reduced by a factor of about 3 if a larger charm quark mass\nof 1.5 GeV or a lower initial temperature of T 0 = 630 MeV is used. It is, however, not much\naffected by using massless gluons due to increase in the gluon density. On the other hand,\nincreasing the initial temperature to 750 MeV would enhance the thermally produced charm\nquark pairs by about a factor of 2.\n7.9. Charm production in nuclear collisions\nB. Z. Kopeliovich and I. Schmidt\nNuclear suppression of heavy flavor inclusive production in hard partonic collisions has a leading\ntwist component related to gluon shadowing, as well as a higher twist contribution related to the\nnonzero separation of the produced Q\u0304Q pair. Both terms are evaluated and suppression for charm\nproduction in heavy ion collisions at LHC is predicted.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n141\n\n7.9.1. Higher twist shadowing Heavy flavors are produced via gluon fusion, therefore they\nserve as a good probe for the gluon distribution function in nuclei. The light-cone dipole\napproach is an effective tool for the calculation of nuclear effects in these processes, since the\nphenomenological dipole cross section includes by default all higher order and higher twist\nterms.\nThe production of heavy flavors can be treated as freeing of a Q\u0304Q fluctuation in the\nincoming hadron, in which the interaction with such a small dipole (actually, with a three-body\nQ\u0304Qg dipole) results in nuclear shadowing, which is a higher twist, 1/m2Q , effect. Although\nvery small, it steeply rises with energy and reaches sizable magnitude at the energy of LHC.\nThe effect of this higher twist shadowing on charm production in minimal bias and central\ncollisions of heavy ions at the energies of RHIC and LHC is shown in figure 117 as the\ndifference between solid and dashed curves.\n\nFigure 117: Shadowing for DY reaction in pA (upper curves) and dA (lower curves) collisions\n\u221a\n\u221a\nat the energies of RHIC ( sNN = 200 GeV) and LHC ( sNN = 5500 GeV), as function of xF\nand dilepton mass M 2 . The left and right figures are calculated at M = 4.5 GeV and xF = 0.5\nrespectively.\n\n7.9.2. Process dependent leading twist gluon shadowing The projectile fluctuations\ncontaining, besides the Q\u0304Q, also gluons, are responsible for gluon shadowing, which is a\nleading twist effect. Indeed, the aligned jet configurations, i.e. the fluctuation in which the\nQ\u0304Q pair carries the main fraction of the momentum, have a large and scale independent,\ntransverse size. Gluon shadowing is expected to be a rather weak effect [318] due to the\nlocalization of the glue inside small spots in the proton [96]. This is confirmed by the latest\nNLO analysis [15] of data on DIS on nuclei.\nUnlike for the DIS case, where the produced q\u0304q is predominantly in a color octet state,\nin the case of hadroproduction the Q\u0304Q may be either colorless or a color octet. Moreover,\nin the latter case it may have different symmetries [319, 320]. Nonperturbative effects, which\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n142\n\ncause a contraction of the gluon cloud, may be absent for a colorless Q\u0304Q, leading to a much\nstronger shadowing compared to DIS. This possibility was taken into account predicting the\nrather strong nuclear effects depicted in figure 117. This part of the prediction should be taken\nwith precaution, since it has never been tested by data.\nFigure 117 shows our results for RAA/NN as function of rapidity for minimal bias and\ncentral collisions. These calculations do not include the suppression caused by energy\nconservation at the ends of the rapidity interval [321].\nThe rather strong suppression of charm production that we found should be taken into\naccount as part of the strong suppression of high pT charm production observed in central\nnuclear collisions at RHIC. At high pT this effect should fade away because of the rise of x2 ,\nalthough at the LHC this may be a considerable correction.\n7.10. Charm and Beauty Hadrons from Strangeness-rich QGP at LHC\nI. Kuznetsova and J. Rafelski\nThe yields of heavy flavored hadrons emitted by strangeness rich QGP are evaluated within\nchemical non-equilibrium statistical hadronization model, conserving strangeness, heavy flavor, and\nentropy yields at hadronization.\n\nA relatively large number of hadrons containing charm (dNc /dy \u2243 10) and bottom\n(dNb /dy \u2243 1) quarks are expected to be produced at central rapidity in heavy ion (Pb\u2013Pb)\ncollisions at the Large Hadrons Collider (LHC). This report summarized results of our more\nextensive recent report [322], and amplifies its findings with reference to the 'first day' LHCion results. Differing from other recent studies which assume that the hadron yields after\nhadronization are in chemical equilibrium [323], we form the charm hadron yields in the\nstatistical hadronization approach based on an abundance of u, d, s quark pairs fixed by the\nbulk properties of a practically chemically equilibrated QGP phase.\nIn proceeding in this fashion we are respecting the constraints of the recombinant\ndynamic model [324]. The absolute yields (absolute chemical equilibrium) depend in addition\nto recombination on absolute heavy quark yield dNb,c /dy. We are fully implementing the\nrelative chemical equilibrium, that is the formation of heavy (charmed) hadrons according\nthe the relative phase space, thus ratios of yields presented here are a complete and reliable\nprediction characterized by QGP entropy and strangeness content.\nIt is energetically more effective for strange quarks to emerge bound to heavy quarks.\nSaid differently, the reaction K + D \u2192 \u03c0 + D s is strongly exothermic, with \u2206Q \u2243 240 MeV,\nand similarly for the bottom quark. Considering that the phase space for hadronization is\ncharacterized by a domain temperature T = 160 \u00b1 20 MeV, in presence of strangeness the\nyield tilts in favor D s over D, and B s over B.The variability in the light and strange quark\ncontent at given hadronization temperature T is accomplished introducing the phase space\nH\noccupancy \u03b3H\ns > 1, \u03b3q > 1 of strange, and, respectively, light constituent quarks in the hadron\nH\nphase. In chemical equilibrium \u03b3H\ns = \u03b3q = 1.\nA phase space evaluation of the relative yields leads to the results presented in figure 118,\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n14\n\n10\nT=140 MeV\nT=160 MeV\nT=180 MeV\n\n8\n\ncqq/css, T=140 MeV\ncqq/css, T=170 MeV\ncqq/css, T=200 MeV\ncqq/cqs, T=140 MeV\ncqq/cqs, T=170 MeV\ncqq/cqs, T=200 MeV\n\n12\n10\n\nD/Ds\n\n143\n\n6\n\n8\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n2\n\n2\n0.0\n0.0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03b3 /\u03b3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n\ns q\n\n1\n\n2 \u03b3 /\u03b3\n\n3\n\n4\n\ns q\n\nFigure 118: As a function of \u03b3Hs /\u03b3qH on left: D/D s ratio and on right: cqq/css = (\u039bc + \u03a3c )/\u03a9c (upper\nlines) and cqq/cqs = (\u039bc + \u03a3c )/\u039ec (lower lines) ratios.\n\nwhere we show ratio of open charm strange meson and baryons with the corresponding 'less'\nH\nstrange open charmed (strange) meson and baryons, as a function of \u03b3H\ns /\u03b3q , which is the\ncontrolling variable for three values T = 200 MeV, T = 180\u2013160 MeV and T = 140 MeV. The\ncorresponding chemical reference results are indicated by the crossing vertical and horizontal\nlines. For B, B s mesons the results are the same as for D, D s mesons, see [322] for details.\nH\nThe challenge is to understand what values of \u03b3H\ns /\u03b3q a fast hadronizing QGP implies.\nWe obtain these by requiring that the hadronization of QGP proceeds conserving the entropy\ndS /dy and strangeness ds/dy = d s\u0304/dy content of QGP. For LHC the expected ratio s/S =\n0.038 [169] at T = 140\u2013180 MeV which implies in the hadron phase \u03b3 s/\u03b3q = 1.8\u20132 [168]. This\nentails a considerable shift of open charm hadrons away from hadron chemical equilibrium\nyield towards states containing strangeness in all cases considered in figure 118 (and similarly\nfor the bottom flavor). The hadronization process, as expected, favors formation of strange\ncharmed meson and baryons, once the actual QGP strangeness yield near/above-chemical\nequilibrium is allowed for.\n7.11. Charmonium Suppression in Strangeness-rich QGP\nI. Kuznetsova and J. Rafelski\nThe yields of cc\u0304 mesons formed in presence of entropy and strangeness rich QGP are evaluated\nwithin chemical non-equilibrium statistical hadronization model, conserving strangeness and entropy\nyields at hadronization. We find that for a given dNc /dy charm yield, the abundant presence of light an\nstrange quarks favors formation of D, D s mesons and to suppression of charmonium.\n\nThere is considerable energetic advantage for a charm quark to bind with a strange quark\n\u2013 most, if not all, charmonium\u2013strange meson/baryon reactions of the type cc\u0304 + sX \u2192 cX + c\u0304s,\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u03b3 =\u03b3 =1\nq\n\n2\n\n\u03b3 =\u03b3 =1\n\ns\n\nq\n\nH\n\nQ\n\nH\n\ns/S=0.03, S =S\n\nT=170 MeV, \u03b3s=\u03b3q=1\nT=170 MeV, SH=SQ, \u03b3 =1.12\nq\ncr\nT=170 MeV, \u03b3q=\u03b3q =1.51\nH Q\nT=140 MeV, S =S , \u03b3 =1.6\n\ns\n\nQ\n\ns/S=0.04, S =S\n\nq\n\n2 2\n\nJ/\u03a8/J/\u03a8eq=\u03b3c /\u03b3c eq\n\ndNhid/dy/Nc\n\n2\n\n10\n\n144\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n10\n\n140 160 180 200 220 240 260\n\n140 160 180 200 220 240 260\n\nT [MeV]\n\nT [MeV]\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03b3 /\u03b3\n\n3\n\n4\n\ns q\n\nFigure 119: Left two panels: cc\u0304/Nc2 relative yields as a function of hadronization temperature\nH\nT, right panel ratio J/\u03a8/J/\u03a8eq as a function of \u03b3H\ns /\u03b3q , see tex.\nwhere X \u2261 q\u0304 = \u016b, d\u0304 or X \u2261 qq, qs, ss are strongly exothermic. In statistical hadronization\nthis phase space effect favors formation of D s over cc\u0304. Seen from the kinetic model\nperspective [324], this observation shows a strong channel of charmonium destruction. Thus\npresence of strangeness facilitates a novel charmonium suppression mechanism [322, 325].\nTo implement this effect hadronization of QGP must conserve strangeness and entropy and\nthus cannot be ad-hoc associated with chemical equilibrium.\nIn the non-equilibrium statistical hadronization model we balance total yield of charmed\nparticles within a given volume dV/dy to the level available in the QGP phase dNc /dy \u221d\ndV/dy(\u03b3cH \u03b3iH + . . .), where a few percent of the yield is in multi-charm baryons and\ncharmonium involving higher powers of \u03b3cH . This constraint determines a value of \u03b3cH , which\nfor the case of LHC can be considerably above unity. Therefore, the hadronization yields we\ncompute for hidden charm mesons: dNcc\u0304 /dy \u221d dV/dy\u03b3cH 2 \u221d (dNc /dy)2 /(\u03b3iH 2 dV/dy). depends\non the inverse of the model dependent reaction volume, and scales with the square of the total\ncharm yields [324]. We also show above that for the case that \u03b3iH > 1 a hereto unexpected\nsuppression of 'onium yield is expected.\nIn figure 119 the yield of all hidden charm cc\u0304 (sum over all cc\u0304 mesons) is shown,\nnormalized by the square of dNc /dy = 10 (middle panel for LHC environment) and dNc /dy = 3\n(left panel, RHIC environment), as a function of hadronization temperature T . We show\nresult for s/S = 0.03 with dV/dy = 600 fm3 , T = 200 MeV (solid line, left panel) and for\ns/S = 0.04 with dV/dy = 800 fm3 , T = 200 MeV (solid line, middle panel). Results shown\nfor chemical equilibrium case (dashed lines) are for the values \u03b3 s = \u03b3q = 1. For the chemical\nnon-equilibrium hadronization (solid lines \u03b3iH > 1, i = q, s), the QGP and hadron phase space\nis evaluated conserving entropy S Q = S H and strangeness sQ = sH between phases.\nWe see, comparing the left and middle panel that the yield of cc\u0304 mesons decreases with\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n145\n\nincreasing specific strangeness content (note logarithmic scale). The chemical suppression\neffect is further quantified in third, right panel in figure 119, where we show the ratio\nH\nH\nJ/\u03a8/J/\u03a8eq = \u03b3c2 /\u03b3c2eq as a function of \u03b3H\ns /\u03b3q at fixed value of \u03b3q and, as required, entropy\nconservation for T = 140, 170 MeV. For T = 140 MeV we show result with \u03b3q = 1.6 (solid\ndotted line) which corresponds entropy conservation between QGP and hadronic phase for this\nhadronization temperature. For T = 170 MeV we show results with \u03b3q \u2248 \u03b3qcr = 1.51 \u2261 em\u03c0 /2T\n(dash-dot line), \u03b3q = 1.12 (solid line) and \u03b3q = 1 (dashed line). For \u03b3q = 1.12 entropy is\nconserved in hadronization at T = 170 MeV .\nThe formation of the Bc (b\u0304c) proposed as another QGP signature [326] has not been\nevaluated in the present work, since this particle yield suffers from additional (canonical)\nsuppression. Kinetic formation models suggest significant enhancement of this double exotic\nmeson, as compared to a cascade of NN reactions.\n7.12. J/\u03c8 pT spectra from in-medium recombination\nR. L. Thews and M. L. Mangano\nWe consider production of J/\u03c8 by recombination of c, c\u0304 quarks produced in separate N-N\ninteractions during Pb-Pb collisions. Inputs for the calculation include the NLO pQCD spectra of\ncharm quarks, plus a range of nuclear parameters taken from extrapolation of results at RHIC energy.\n\nThe possibility that J/\u03c8 could be formed in AA collisions by recombination in a region\nof color deconfinement was first developed in Ref. [324]. It was motivated by the realization\nthat the total formation probability would be proportional to the square of the total number\nof cc\u0304 pairs, which at RHIC and especially LHC provide a large enhancement factor. One can\ncalculate the pT and y spectra of J/\u03c8 formed either through recombination or direct initial\nproduction, using the corresponding quark spectra from a pQCD NLO calculation [297] in\nindividual nucleon-nucleon interactions. The method involves generating a sample of these\ninitially-produced cc\u0304 pairs, smearing the transverse momentum with a gaussian distribution\nof width hkT 2 i to simulate nuclear broadening and confinement effects, and weighting each\npair with a formation cross section. This procedure naturally divides the total pair sample\ninto two categories: the so-called \"diagonal\" sample, which pairs the c and c\u0304 from the same\nnucleon-nucleon interaction and the \"off-diagonal\" sample, where c and c\u0304 come from different\nnucleon-nucleon interactions. The spectra of the resulting J/\u03c8 will retain some memory of\nthe charm quark spectra and provide signatures of the two different origins. For example, one\nexpects the pT spectrum of non-diagonal pairs to be softer, since it is less likely for high-pT\nc and c\u0304 quarks from independent scatterings to be close enough in phase-space to coalesce\ninto a J/\u03c8. Results for RHIC were presented in Ref. [327], where the primary signal was\nfound to be a narrowing of the non-diagonal y and pT spectra, relative to the diagonal ones.\nWe show in Fig. 120 the calculated J/\u03c8 width hpT 2 i as a function of hkT 2 i, for central and\nforward production in ALICE. hpT 2 i grows with hkT 2 i for both the direct initial production\nand the in-medium formation, but the latter widths are always smaller than the former. Widths\nat small y are also greater than at large y, reflecting the underlying pQCD distributions.

Thus with\nmeasurements of hpT 2 i pp and hpT 2 i pA one can extract \u03bb2 and calculate the corresponding\nnuclear broadening for AA interactions. The lower plots of Fig. 120 show the results for\nPb-Pb at 5.5 TeV, with hkT 2 i pp =0 and 5 GeV 2 . For both cases the J/\u03c8 widths will provide a\nclear discrimination between direct initial production and in-medium formation. In general,\none would expect some combination of initial production and in-medium formation, so the\nprediction is bounded from above and below. There is almost no change in the pT (c) spectra\nbetween 5.5 and 14 TeV. Thus we can use the 14 TeV pp data to determine hkT 2 i pp at 5.5 TeV.\nOne can then expect that the absence of energy dependence will also hold for p-Pb results,\nallowing us to also determine \u03bb2 at 5.5 TeV from a measurement at any LHC energy, thus\nfixing the prediction for curves such as those in Fig. 120.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\u03a5\nJ/\u03c8\n\u03c7b\n\u03a5'\n\n0.6\n\n1\n0.8\n\u0393(T) [GeV]\n\nEbinding [GeV]\n\n0.5\n\n147\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\u03a5\n\n0.4\n\n\u03a5'\n\u03c7b\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\nJ/\u03c8\n0\n\n0\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\nT/Tc\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\n2.8\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\nT/Tc\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\nFigure 121: Upper limit of the binding energy (left) and the width (right) of quarkonium\nstates.

M\u00f3csy and P. Petreczky\nWe predict the upper bound on the dissociation temperatures of different quarkonium states.\n\nIn a recent paper [328] we analyzed in detail the quarkonium spectral functions. This\nanalysis has shown that spectral functions calculated using potential model for the nonrelativistic Green's function combined with perturbative QCD can describe the available\nlattice data on quarkonium correlators both at zero and finite temperature in QCD with no light\nquarks [328]. Charmonia, however, were found to be dissolved at temperatures significantly\nlower than quoted in lattice QCD studies, and in contradiction with other claims made in\nrecent years from different potential model studies. In [329] we extended the analysis to\nreal QCD with one strange quark and two light quarks using new lattice QCD data on quark\nanti-quark free energy obtained with small quark masses [330].\nHere we briefly outline the main results of the analysis of [329], in particular the estimate\nfor the upper limit on the dissociation temperatures. There is an uncertainty in choosing\nthe quark-antiquark potential at finite temperature. In [329] we considered two choices of\nthe potential, both consistent with the lattice data [330]. The more extreme choice, still\ncompatible with lattice data, leads to the largest possible binding energy. In this most binding\npotential some of the quarkonium states survive above deconfinement, but their strongly\ntemperature-dependent binding energy is significantly reduced. This is shown in figure 121.\nDue to the reduced binding energy thermal activation can lead to the dissociation of quarkonia,\neven when the corresponding peak is present in the spectral function. Knowing the binding\nenergy we estimate the thermal width using the analysis of [331]. The expression of the rate\nof thermal excitation has particularly simple form in the two limiting cases:\nr\n4\nT\n(LT )2\nMe\u2212Ebin /T , E bin \u226b T \u0393(T ) =\n, E bin \u226a T .\n\u0393(T ) =\n3\u03c0\nL 2\u03c0M\nHere M is the quarkonium mass, L is the size of the spatial region of the potential, given by the\ndistance from the average quarkonium radius to the top of the potential, i.e. L = rmed \u2212 hr2 i1/2 ,\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n148\n\nrmed being the effective range of the potential [329]. Using the above formulas we estimate the\nthermal width of charmonium and bottomonium states. Since in the deconfined phase E bin < T\nthe 1S charmonium and 2S and 1P bottomonium states are in the regime of weak binding,\nand their width is large, as shown in figure 121. The 1S bottomonium is strongly bound for\nT < 1.6T c and its thermal width is smaller than 40 MeV. For T > 1.6T c , however, even the 1S\nbottomonium states is in the weak binding regime resulting in the large increase of the width,\nsee figure 121. When the thermal width is significantly larger than the binding energy no peak\nstructure will be present in the spectral functions, even though the simple potential model\ncalculation predicts a peak. Therefore, we define a conservative dissociation temperature by\nthe condition \u0393 > 2E bin . The obtained dissociation temperatures are summarized in table 7.13.\n\nTable 7: Upper bound on quarkonium dissociation temperatures.\nstate \u03c7c\n\u03c8\u2032\nJ/\u03c8\n\u03a5\u2032\n\u03c7b\n\u03a5\nT dis \u2264 T c \u2264 T c 1.2T c 1.2T c 1.3T c 2T c\nFrom the table it is clear that all quarkonium states, except the 1S bottomonium, will melt\nat temperatures considerably smaller than previous estimates, and will for certain be dissolved\nin the matter produced in heavy ion collision at LHC. Furthermore, it is likely that at energy\ndensities reached at the LHC a large fraction of the 1S bottomonium states will also dissolve.\nIt has to be seen to what extent these findings will result in large RAA suppression at LHC. For\nthis more information about initial state effects is needed. Moreover, the spectral functions are\nstrongly enhanced over the free case even when quarkonium states are dissolved [328, 329]\nindicating significant correlations between the heavy quark and antiquark. Therefore, one\nshould take into account also the possibility of quarkonium regeneration from correlated initial\nquark-antiquark pairs.\n7.14. Heavy flavor production and suppression at the LHC\nI. Vitev\nPredictions for the baseline D- and B-mesons production cross sections at s1/2 = 5.5 TeV at\nthe LHC in p+p collisions are given for pT > Mc,b , respectively. New measurements that allow to\nidentify the underlying hard partonic processes in heavy flavor production are discussed. Based on\nthe short D- and B-mesons formation times, medium-induced dissociation is proposed as a mechanism\nof heavy flavor suppression in the QGP at intermediate pT . In contrast to previous results on heavy\nquark modification, this approach predicts suppression of B-mesons comparable to that of D-mesons at\ntransverse momenta as low as pT \u223c 10 GeV. Suppression of non-photonic electrons form the primary\nsemi-leptonic decays of charm and beauty hadrons is calculated in the pT region where collisional\ndissociation is expected to be relevant.\n\nPredictions for the baseline D0 , D+, B0 , B+ cross sections in p+p collisions at the LHC\nat s1/2 = 5.5 TeV are given in the left panel of Fig. 122 [332].

RAA (pT ) results for charm and beauty from this novel suppression\nmechanism at RHIC and LHC are shown in the left panel of Fig. 123. Attenuation rate similar\nto the light hadron quenching from radiative energy loss [333] is achieved. The right panel\nof Fig. 123 shows the suppression of the single non-photonic 0.5(e+ + e\u2212 ) in central Au+Au\nand Pb+Pb collisions at RHIC and LHC respectively [334].

Results on RAA (pT ) in central Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC are\ncompared to central Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at RHIC [334, 335].

The CERN SPS data suggest a J/\u03c8 absorption cross section of about 4 mb\nwithout shadowing, and a larger absorption cross section if it is included since the SPS x range\nJ/\u03c8\nis in the antishadowing region. The d+Au RHIC data support smaller absorption, \u03c3abs \u223c 0 \u2212 2\nmb. Thus our predictions for J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 production in pPb and Pb+Pb interactions at the LHC\nare shown for initial-state shadowing alone with no absorption or dense matter effects. We\nnote that including absorption would only move the calculated ratios down in proportion to the\nabsorption survival probability since, at LHC energies, any rapidity dependence of absorption\nis at very large |y| [338], outside the detector acceptance.\nWe present R pPb (y) = pPb/pp and RPbPb(y) = PbPb/pp for J/\u03c8 and \u03a5. Since the pp,\npPb and Pb+Pb data are likely to be taken at different energies (14 TeV, 8.8 TeV and 5.5\nTeV respectively), to make the calculations as realistic as possible we show several different\nscenarios for R pPb (y) and RPbPb(y). The lead nucleus is assumed to come from the right in\npPb. All the pA calculations employ the EKS98 shadowing parameterization [339, 340]. The\ndifference in the J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 results is primarily due to the larger \u03a5 mass which increases the\nx values by about a factor of three. In addition, the higher Q2 reduces the overall shadowing\neffect.\n\u221a\nThe top of Fig. 124 shows R pPb (y) for pPb/pp with both systems at S NN = 8.8 and 5.5\nTeV (dashed and dot-dashed curves respectively), ignoring the \u2206y = 0.46 rapidity shift at 8.8\nTeV. For the J/\u03c8, these ratios are relatively flat at forward rapidity where the x in the lead\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n151\n\nis small. The larger x and greater Q2 for the \u03a5 brings the onset of antishadowing closer to\nmidrapidity, within the range of the ALICE dimuon spectrometer. At far backward rapidity, a\nrise due to the antishadowing region is seen. The lower energy moves the antishadowing peak\nto the right for both quarkonia states. We show R pPb (y) with pPb at 8.8 TeV and pp at 14 TeV\nwith \u2206y = 0 in the dotted curves. The effect on the J/\u03c8 is an apparent lowering of the dashed\ncurve. Since the \u03a5 rapidity distribution is narrower at 8.8 TeV than at 14 TeV in the rapidity\nrange shown here, the \u03a5 curve turns over at large |y|. (This effect occurs at |y| > 6 for the J/\u03c8.)\nThe solid curves show R pPb (y) for 8.8 TeV pPb and 14 TeV pp with the rapidity shift. Both\nthe J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 ratios are essentially constant for y > \u22122.5. Thus relying on ratios of pA to pp\ncollisions at different energies to study shadowing (or other small x effects) may be difficult\nbecause the shadowing function is hard to unfold when accounting for the pA \u2206y as well as\nthe difference in x. If d+Pb collisions were used, \u2206y would be significantly reduced [341].\nThe lower part of Fig. 124 shows RPbPb(y) for the J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 at 5.5 TeV for both\nsystems. No additional dense matter effects such as QQ coalescence or plasma screening\nare included. The EKS98 (dashed) and nDSg [15] (dot-dashed) shadowing parameterizations\nare compared. The results are very similar over the entire rapidity range. (Other shadowing\nparameterizations,which do not agree with the RHIC d+Au data, give different RPbPb(y).)\nThere are antishadowing peaks at far forward and backward rapidity. As at RHIC, including\nshadowing on both nuclei lowers the overall ratio relative to R pPb (y) as well as making\nRPbPb (y > 2) similar to or larger than RPbPb (y = 0) because, without any other effects,\n\u221a\nRPbPb (y) \u223c R pPb (y)R pPb (\u2212y) when all systems are compared at the same S NN . The solid\ncurves show the ratios for Pb+Pb at 5.5 TeV relative to pp at 14 TeV with the EKS98\nparameterization. The trends are similar but the magnitude is lower.\nSince these calculations reflect what should be seen if nothing else occurs, RPbPb (y) is\nexpected to differ significantly due to dense matter effects. If the initial J/\u03c8 production is\nstrongly suppressed by plasma screening, then the only observed J/\u03c8's would be from cc\ncoalesence [327] or B meson decays. It should be possible to experimentally distinguish\nsecondary production from the primordial distributions by displaced vertex cuts. Secondary\nJ/\u03c8 production should have a narrower rapidity distribution and a lower average pT . Both are\n\u221a\nindicated in central Au+Au collisions at S NN = 200 GeV at RHIC [342]. If J/\u03c8 production\nin central collisions is dominated by secondary J/\u03c8's, peripheral collisions should still reflect\ninitial-state effects. Predictions of the centrality dependence of shadowing on J/\u03c8 production\nat RHIC agree with the most peripheral Au+Au data.\nFinally, the J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 rapidity distributions are likely to be inclusive, including feed\ndown from higher quarkonium states. Initial-state effects should be the same for all members\nof a quarkonium family so that these ratios would be the same for direct and inclusive\nproduction.\n7.16.

The PbPb/pp ratios\nare shown for 5.5 TeV in both cases with EKS98 (dashed) and nDSg (dot-dashed) shadowing\nand also for 5.5 TeV Pb+Pb and 14 TeV pp (solid).\nWe present a revised look at the predictions of Ref. [343], taking into account\nnewer calculations of the screening mass with temperature and the quarkonia dissociation\ntemperature based on both potential models and calculations of quarkonium spectral\nfunctions. The estimates of Digal et al. [344] predict lower quarkonium dissociation\ntemperatures, 1.1T c for the J/\u03c8 and 2.3T c for the \u03a5, with \u03bc = 1.15T . A later review by\nSatz [345], predicts higher values, more in line with the recent calculations of quarkonium\nspectral functions, 2.1T c for the J/\u03c8 and 4.1T c for the \u03a5, as well as \u03bc \u223c 1.45T for T > 1.1T c .\nWe assume 700 < T 0 < 850 MeV and \u03c40 = 0.2 fm [346]. The pT dependence of the screening\nis calculated as first discussed in Ref. [347]. Since it may be unlikely for feed down\ncontributions to be separated from the inclusive \u03c8 and \u03a5 yields in AA collisions, we present\nthe indirect \u03c8\u2032 /\u03c8 and \u03a5\u2032 /\u03a5 ratios, with feed down included, in Fig. 125. While the individual\nsuppression factors are smooth as a function of pT , as shown in Fig. 126 for all four sets of\ninitial conditions and dissociation temperatures, due to their different predicted dissociation\ntemperatures and formation times, they contribute differently to the ratios in Fig. 125.\nWe have assumed that the \u03c8\u2032 /\u03c8 and \u03a5\u2032 /\u03a5 ratios are independent of pT , as predicted in\nthe color evaporation model [348]. However, if this is not the case, any slope of the pT ratios\nin pp collisions can be calculated and/or evalulated experimentally and deconvoluted from\nthe data. Quarkonium regeneration by coalescence [327] has not been included here. While\nit is unknown how coalescence production populates the quarkonium levels, since the pT of\nquarkonium states produced by coalescence is lower than those produced in the initial NN\ncollisions, higher pT quarkonia should have a smaller coalescence contribution.

The \u03c8 (\u03a5) results are shown for assumed dissociation temperatures of 1.1T c (2.3T c )\n(solid and dot-dashed) and 2.1T c (4.1T c ) (dashed and dotted) respectively.\nBB rates should reduce the coalescence probability of \u03a5 production. By taking the \u03c8\u2032 /\u03c8 and\n\u03a5\u2032 /\u03a5 ratios, we reduce systematics and initial-state effects.\nIn the case where T D = 1.1T c for the J/\u03c8, its shorter formation time leads to suppression\nover a larger pT range than that for the \u03c7c and \u03c8\u2032 , leading to a larger \u03c8\u2032 /\u03c8 ratio than the pp\nvalue over all pT . On the other hand, for the higher dissociation temperature, the pT range of\nJ/\u03c8 suppression is shorter than for the other charmonium states, giving a smaller ratio than in\npp. The low pT behavior of the dashed and dotted curves in the left-hand side of Fig. 125 is\ndue to the disappearance of \u03c7c suppression since the \u03c7c is suppressed over a shorter pT range\nthan the \u03c8\u2032 .\nSince there are more states below the BB threshold for the \u03a5 family, the suppression is\nmore complicated, in part because there are also feed down contributions to the \u03a5\u2032 , leading\nto more structure in the \u03a5\u2032 /\u03a5 ratios on the right-hand side of Fig. 125. For \u03bc = 1.15T , the\n\u03a5 itself is suppressed, albeit over a short pT range. The dips in the solid and dashed curves\noccur at the pT where direct \u03a5 suppression ceases. In the case where T D = 4.1T c for the \u03a5,\nthe initial temperature is not large enough to suppress direct \u03a5 production so that \u03a5\u2032 /\u03a5 < 1\nfor all pT .

The calculations have been performed for the\ninitial conditions mentioned in table 8 (see also [349]). The values of parameters shown\nin table 8 reproduce the various experimental data from SPS and RHIC. For LHC we have\nchosen two values of T i corresponding to two values of dN/dy. We use the Bag model EOS\nfor the QGP phase. For EOS of the hadronic matter all resonances with mass \u2264 2.5 GeV have\nbeen considered\nThe variation of Rem with pT for different initial conditions are depicted in Fig. 127 (left\npanel). At SPS, the contributions from hadronic matter (HM) coincides with the total and\nhence it becomes difficult to make any conclusion about the formation of QGP. However,\nfor RHIC and LHC the contributions from HM are less than the total indicating large\ncontributions from quark matter. The quantity, Rem , reaches a plateau beyond pT = 1 GeV\nfor all the three cases i.e. for SPS, RHIC and LHC. However, it is very important to note that\nLHC > RRHIC > RS PS . Now for all\nthe values of Rem at the plateau region are different, e.g. Rem\nem\nem\nthe three cases, SPS, RHIC and LHC, except T i all other quantities e.g. T c , v0 , T f and EOS\nare same, indicating that the difference in the value of Rem in the plateau region originates\nonly due to different values of T i for the three cases (Fig. 127, right panel). This, hence can\nbe used as a measure of T i .\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n156\n\nWe have observed that although the individual pT distribution of photons and lepton pairs\nare sensitive to different EOS (lattice QCD, for example) the ratio Rem is not.

Prompt photon in heavy ion collisions at the LHC: A \"multi-purpose\" observable\nF. Arleo\nI emphasize in this contribution how prompt photons can be used to probe nuclear parton densities\nas well as medium-modified fragmentation functions in heavy ion collisions. Various predictions in\np\u2013A and A\u2013A collisions at LHC energies are given.\n\nPrompt photon production in hadronic collisions has been extensively studied, both\nexperimentally and theoretically, over the past 25 years (see [351] and references therein).\nAs indicated in Ref. [351], it is remarkable that almost all existing data from fixed-target\nto collider energies can be very well understood within perturbative QCD at NLO. In\nthese proceedings, I briefly discuss how prompt photons in nuclear collisions (p\u2013A and\nA\u2013A) may allow for a better understanding of interesting aspects discussed in heavy-ion\ncollisions, namely the physics of nuclear parton distribution functions and medium-modified\nfragmentation functions. Parton distribution functions in nuclei are so far poorly constrained,\nespecially in contrast with the high degree of accuracy currently reached in the proton\nchannel, over a wide x and Q2 domain. In particular, only high-x (x & 10\u22122) and low Q2\n(Q2 . 100 GeV2 ) have been probed in fixed-target experiments. In order to predict hard\nprocesses in nuclear collisions at the LHC, a more accurate knowledge on a wider kinematic\nrange is necessary.

Direct photon spectra in Pb-Pb at\n\n\u221a\n\nsNN = 5.5 TeV: hydrodynamics+pQCD predictions\n\nF. Arleo, D. d'Enterria and D. Peressounko\nThe pT -differential spectra for direct photons produced in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC, including\nthermal (hydrodynamics) and prompt (pQCD) emissions are presented.\n\nWe present predictions for the transverse momentum distributions of direct-\u03b3 (i.e.\nphotons not coming from hadron decays) produced at mid-rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at\n\u221a\nsNN = 5.5 TeV based on a combined hydrodynamics+pQCD approach. Thermal photon\nemission in Pb-Pb at the LHC is computed with a hydrodynamical model successfully used in\nnucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC energies [10]. The initial entropy density of the produced\nsystem at LHC is obtained by extrapolating empirically the hadron multiplicities measured\nat RHIC [355]. Above pT \u2248 3 GeV/c, additional prompt-\u03b3 production from parton-parton\nscatterings is computed perturbatively at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy [356]. We use\nrecent parton distribution functions (PDF) [13] and parton-to-photon fragmentation functions\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n158\n\n(FF) [357], modified resp. to account for initial-state shadowing+isospin effects [15] and\nfinal-state parton energy loss [358].\nWe follow the evolution of the hot and dense system produced in central Pb-Pb at LHC\nby solving the equations of (ideal) relativistic 2D+1 hydrodynamics [10, 355] starting at\na time \u03c40 = 1/Q s \u2248 0.1 fm/c. The system is assumed to have an initial entropy density\nof s0 = 1120 fm\u22123 , which corresponds to a maximum temperature at the center of T 0 \u2248\n650 MeV (hT 0 i \u2248 470 MeV). We use a quark gluon plasma (QGP) and hadron resonance\ngas (HRG) equation of state above and below T crit \u2248 170 MeV resp., connected by a\nstandard Maxwell construction assuming a first-order phase transition at T crit . Thermal\nphoton emission is computed using the most recent parametrizations of the QGP and HRG\n\u03b3 rates. For the QGP phase we use the AMY complete leading-log emission rates including\nLPM suppression [240]. For the HRG phase, we employ the improved parametrization from\nTurbide et al. [359].\nOur NLO pQCD predictions are obtained with the code of ref. [356] with all scales\nset to \u03bc = pT . Pb-Pb yields are obtained scaling the NLO cross-sections by the number of\nincoherent nucleon-nucleon collisions: Ncoll = 1670, 12.9 for 0-10% central (hbi = 3.2 fm)\nand 60-90% peripheral (hbi = 13 fm). Nuclear (isospin and shadowing) corrections of the\nCTEQ6.5M PDFs [13] are introduced using the NLO nDSg parametrization [15]. At relatively\nlow pT , prompt photon yields have a large contribution from jet fragmentation processes.\nAs a result, final-state parton energy loss in central Pb-Pb affects also the expected prompt\n\u03b3 yields. We account for medium-effects on the \u03b3-fragmentation component by modifying\nthe BFG parton-to-photon FFs [357] with BDMPS quenching weights. The effects of the\nenergy loss are encoded in a single parameter, \u03c9c = hq\u0302i L2 \u2248 50 GeV, extrapolated from RHIC.\nThe combination of initial-state (shadowing) and final-state (energy loss) effects results in a\nquenching factor for prompt photons of RPbPb \u2248 0.2 (0.8) at pT = 10 (100) GeV/c [358].\nOur predictions for the direct photon spectra at y=0 in Pb-Pb at 5.5 TeV are shown in\nFig. 130. The thermal contribution dominates over the (quenched) pQCD one up to pT \u2248\n4 (1.5) GeV/c in central (peripheral) Pb-Pb. Two differences are worth noting compared to\nRHIC results [10]: (i) the thermal-prompt crossing point moves up from pT \u2248 2.5 GeV/c\nto pT \u2248 4.5 GeV/c, and (ii) most of the thermal production in this transition region comes\nsolely from the QGP phase. Both characteristics make of semi-hard direct photons at LHC, a\nvaluable probe of the thermodynamical properties of the system.\n8.4. Elliptic flow of thermal photons from RHIC to LHC\nR. Chatterjee, E. Frodermann, U. Heinz and D. K.

Correspondingly\nwe increase the initial peak entropy density in central Au+Au collisions from s0 = 351 fm\u22123\nat \u03c40 = 0.2 fm/c for RHIC to s0 = 2438 fm\u22123 at \u03c40 = 0.1 fm/c for LHC.\n1. Thermal photon spectra: Figure 131 shows the thermal photon pT -spectra (angleintegrated) for RHIC and LHC. At both collision energies the total spectrum is dominated\nby quark matter once pT exceeds a few hundred MeV. Its inverse slope (\"effective temperature\") in the range 1.5 < pT < 3 GeV/c increases by almost 50%, from 303 MeV at RHIC to\n442 MeV at LHC, reflecting the higher initial temperature and significantly increased radial\nflow (visible in the HM contribution) at LHC.\n2. Thermal photon elliptic flow: Figure 132 shows the differential elliptic flow of thermal\nphotons at RHIC and LHC, with quark matter (QM) and hadronic matter (HM) radiation\nshown separately for comparison. The decrease at high pT of the QM and total photon\nv2 reflects the dominance of QM radiation at high pT (emission from the early, hot stage\nwhen radial and elliptic flow are still small). At fixed pT , the photon elliptic flow from QM\nradiation is larger at LHC than at RHIC since the LHC fireballs start hotter and fluid cells\nwith a given temperature thus flow more rapidly. At low pT , hadronic radiation dominates,\nand since it flows more rapidly at LHC than at RHIC the corresponding photon elliptic is\nsignificantly larger at LHC than RHIC. This is different from hadrons whose elliptic flow at\nlow pT decreases from RHIC to LHC, reflecting a redistribution of the momentum anisotropy\nto higher pT by increased radial flow [361]. For photons, the elliptic flow is not yet saturated\nat RHIC, and at low pT it keeps increasing towards LHC at a rate that overwhelms the loss of\nmomentum anisotropy to the high-pT domain via radial flow. Contrary to pion v2 [361], the\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n160\n\npT -integrated photon elliptic flow roughly doubles (!) from RHIC to LHC.\n8.5. Asymmetrical in-medium mesons\nI. M. Dremin\nCherenkov gluons may be in charge of mass asymmetry of in-medium mesons which reveals\nitself in the asymmetry of dilepton spectra.\n\nThe hypothesis about the nuclear analogue of the well known Cherenkov effect [194\u2013\n198] is widely discussed now. The necessary condition for Cherenkov effect in usual or\nhadronic media is the excess of the corresponding refractive index n over 1. There exists the\ngeneral linear relation between this excess \u2206n = n\u22121 and the real part of the forward scattering\namplitude F(E, 0o ). In electrodynamics, it is the dipole excitation of atoms in the medium by\nlight which results in the Breit-Wigner shape of the photon amplitude. In a nuclear medium,\nthis should be the amplitude of gluon scattering on some internal modes of the medium. In\nabsence of the theory of such media I prefer to rely on our knowledge of hadronic reactions.\nFrom experiments at comparatively low energies we learn that the resonances are abundantly\nproduced.

Therefore the hadronic refractive index exceeds 1 in these energy regions.\nPrediction Masses of Cherenkov states are less than in-vacuum meson masses. This leads to\nthe asymmetry of decay spectra of resonances with increased role of low masses.\nProposal Plot the mass distribution of \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 , \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , e+ e\u2212 -pairs near resonance peaks. Thus,\napart from the ordinary Breit-Wigner shape of the cross section for resonance production, the\ndilepton mass spectrum would acquire the additional term proportional to \u2206n (that is typical\nfor Cherenkov effects) at masses below the resonance peak [362]. Therefore its excess (e.g.,\nnear the \u03c1-meson) can be described by the following formula\u266f\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\nm2\u03c1 \u2212 M 2\nA\ndNll\n\uf8ec\uf8ed1 + w\n(61)\n\u03b8(m\n\u2212\nM)\n= 2\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8ec\n\u03c1\ndM (m\u03c1 \u2212 M 2 )2 + M 2 \u03932\nM2\n\nHere M is the total c.m.s. energy of two colliding objects (the dilepton mass), m\u03c1 = 775 MeV\nis the in-vacuum \u03c1-meson mass. The first term corresponds to the Breit-Wigner cross section.\nAccording to the optical theorem it is proportional to the imaginary part of the forward\nscattering amplitude. The second term is proportional to \u2206n where the well known ratio of real\nto imaginary parts of Breit-Wigner amplitudes has been used. It vanishes for M > m\u03c1 because\n\u266f We consider only \u03c1-mesons here because the most precise experimental data are available for them. To include\nother mesons, one should evaluate the corresponding sum of similar expressions.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n162\n\nonly positive \u2206n lead to the Cherenkov effect. Namely it describes the distribution of masses\nof Cherenkov states. In Eq.(61) one should take into account the in-medium modification of\nthe height of the peak and its width. We just fit the parameters A and \u0393 by describing the\nshape of the mass spectrum at 0.75 < M < 0.9 GeV measured in [363\u2013365]. Let us note that\nw is not used in this procedure. The values A = 104 GeV3 and \u0393 = 0.354 GeV were obtained.\nThe width of the in-medium peak is larger than the in-vacuum \u03c1-meson width equal to 150\nMeV.\nThus the low mass spectrum at M < m\u03c1 depends only on a single parameter w which is\ndetermined by the relative role of Cherenkov effects and ordinary mechanism of resonance\nproduction. It is clearly seen from Eq.(61) that the role of the second term in the brackets\nincreases for smaller masses M. The excess spectrum [363\u2013365]. in the mass region from 0.4\nGeV to 0.75 GeV has been fitted by w = 0.19. The slight downward shift about 40 MeV of\nthe peak of the distribution compared with m\u03c1 may be estimated from Eq.(61) at these values\nof the parameters.\nWhether the in-medium Cherenkov gluonic effect is strong can be verified by measuring\nthe angular distribution of the lepton pairs with different masses. The trigger-jet experiments\nsimilar to that at RHIC are necessary to check this prediction. One should measure the angles\nbetween the companion jet axis and the total momentum of the lepton pair. The Cherenkov\npairs with masses between 0.4 GeV and 0.7 GeV should tend to fill in the rings around the jet\naxis. The angular radius \u03b8 of the ring is determined by the usual condition\n1\n(62)\ncos \u03b8 =\nn\nAnother way to demonstrate it is to measure the average mass of lepton pairs as a function of\ntheir polar emission angle (pseudorapidity) with the companion jet direction chosen as z-axis.\nSome excess of low-mass pairs may be observed at the angle (62).\nThe prediction of asymmetric in-medium widening of any resonance at its low-mass side\ndue to Cherenkov gluons is universal. This universality is definitely supported by experiment.\nVery clear signals of the excess on the low-mass sides of \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6 mesons have been seen\nin KEK. This effect for \u03c9-meson is also studied by CBELSA/TAPScollaboration. There are\nsome indications at RHIC on this effect for J/\u03c8-meson.\nTo conclude, the universal asymmetry of in-medium mesons with an excess over the\nusual Breit-Wigner form at low masses is predicted as a signature of Cherenkov gluons\nproduced with energies which fit the left wings of resonances where n exceeds 1.\n8.6. Photons and Dileptons at LHC\nR. J. Fries, S. Turbide, C. Gale and D. K. Srivastava\nWe discuss real and virtual photon sources in heavy ion collisions and present results for dilepton\nyields in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC at intermediate and large transverse momentum pT .\n\nElectromagnetic radiation provides a valuable tool to understand the dynamics of heavy\nion collisions. Due to their long mean free path real and virtual photons carry information\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n163\n\nfrom very early times and from deep inside the fireball. We discuss the sources of photons\nwhich will be important for the upcoming heavy ion experiments at LHC. We focus on\nintermediate and large transverse momenta pT and masses M. We also present our numerical\nresults for dilepton yields.\nAt asymptotically large pT the most important source of real and virtual photons is the\ndirect hard production in primary parton-parton collisions between the nuclei, via Compton\nscattering, annihilation, and the Drell-Yan processes. These photons do not carry any\nsignature of the fireball. They are augmented by photons fragmenting from hard jets also\ncreated in primary parton-parton collisions. The emission of this vacuum bremsstrahlung\nis described by real and virtual photon fragmentation functions. Vacuum fragmentation is\nassumed to happen outside the fireball, so the jets are subject to the full energy loss in the\nmedium. This contribution to the photon and dilepton yield is therefore depleted in heavy ion\ncollisions analogous to the high-pT hadron yield.\nAt intermediate scales jet-induced photons from the medium become important. It has\nbeen shown that high-pT jets interacting with the medium can produce real and virtual photons\nby one of two processes: (i) by Compton scattering or annihilation with a thermal parton,\nleading to an effective conversion of the jet into a photon [366]; (ii) by medium induced\nBremsstrahlung [367]. Jet-medium photons have a steeper spectrum than primary photons\nand carry information about the temperature of the medium. They are also sensitive to the\npartial energy loss that a jet suffers from its creation to the point of emission of the photon. At\neven lower pT and M thermal radiation from the quark gluon plasma (and also the hadronic\nphase not considered here) has to be taken into account.\nFigure 133 shows numerical evaluations of the different contributions discussed above to\n+\nthe e e\u2212 transverse momentum and mass spectrum for central Pb+Pb collisions at LHC. We\nuse next-to-leading order pQCD calculations for Drell Yan and a leading order calculation\nfor jet production. Energy loss of jets is computed with the AMY formalism [368]. Jetmedium emission and thermal emission have been evaluated in the Hard Thermal Loop (HTL)\nresummation scheme. For the mass spectrum we also show the expected background from\ncorrelated heavy quark decays. The full calculation for dileptons with a more extended\ndiscussion is presented in [369]. Predictions for direct photon yields including jet-medium\nphotons can be found in [368].\nDileptons from jet-medium interactions will be more important at LHC than at previous\nlower energy experiments. They will be as important or even exceeding the Drell-Yan yields\nat intermediate masses up to about 8 GeV. They offer a new way to access information about\nthe temperature and the partonic nature of the fireball.\n8.7. Direct photons at LHC\nA. H. Rezaeian, B. Z. Kopeliovich, H. J. Pirner and I.

Introduction Direct photons, i.e. photons not from hadronic decay, provide a powerful\nprobe for the initial state of matter created in heavy ion collisions, since they interact with the\nmedium only electromagnetically and therefore provide a baseline for the interpretation of jetquenching models. The primary motivation for studying the direct photons has been to extract\ninformation about the gluon density inside proton in conjunction with DIS data. However, this\ntask has yet to be fulfilled due to difference between the measurement and perturbative QCD\ncalculation which is difficult to explain by altering the gluon density function (see Ref. [370]\nand references therein). We have recently shown that the color dipole formalism coupled to\nDGLAP evolution is an viable alternative to the parton model and provided a good description\nof inclusive photon and dilepton pair production in hadron-hadron collisions [370]. Here we\n\u221a\npredict the transverse momentum spectra of direct photons at the LHC energies s = 5.5 TeV\nand 14 TeV within the same framework.\n8.7.2. Color dipole approach and predictions for LHC Although in the process of\nelectromagnetic bremsstrahlung by a quark no dipole participates, the cross section can be\nexpressed via the more elementary cross section \u03c3qq\u0304 of interaction of a q\u0304q dipole. For\nthe dipole cross section, we employ the saturation model of Golec-Biernat and W\u00fcsthoff\ncoupled to DGLAP evolution (GBW-DGLAP) [371] which is better suited at large transverse\nmomenta. Without inclusion of DGLAP evolution, the direct photon cross section is\noverestimated [370]. In Fig. 134, we show the GBW-DGLAP dipole model predictions for\ninclusive direct photon production at midrapidities for RHIC, CDF and LHC energies. We\nstress that the theoretical curves in Fig. 134, are the results of a parameter free calculation.\nNotice also that in contrast to the parton model, neither K-factor (NLO corrections), nor higher\ntwist corrections are to be added. No quark-to-photon fragmentation function is needed either.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n3\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\npT(GeV)\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\nEd \u03c3/d P [pb/GeV ]\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\uf8e7\n\nPHENIX, \u221as = 200 GeV\n\uf8e7\n\u221as = 200 GeV\nd \u03c3/dpTd\u03b7 [pb/GeV]\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n\uf8e7\n\nCDF, \u221as = 1.8 TeV\n\uf8e7\n\u221as = 1.8 TeV\n\uf8e7\n\u221as = 5.5 TeV\n\uf8e7\n\u221as = 14 TeV\n\n2\n\n10\n10\n\n165\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\npT(GeV)\n\nFigure 134: Direct photon spectra obtained from GBW-DGLAP dipole model at midrapidity\nfor RHIC, CDF and LHC energies. Experimental data (right) are for inclusive isolated photon\n\u221a\nfrom CDF experiment for |\u03b7| < 0.9 at s = 1.8 TeV [372] and (left) for direct photon at \u03b7 = 0\n\u221a\nfor RHIC energy s = 200 GeV [373]. The error bars are the linear sum of the statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties.\nIndeed, the phenomenological dipole cross section is fitted to DIS data and incorporates all\nperturbative and non-perturbative radiation contributions. For the same reason, in contrast\nto the parton model, in the dipole approach there is no ambiguity in defining the primordial\ntransverse momentum of partons. Such a small purely non-perturbative primordial momentum\ndoes not play a significant role for direct photon production at the given range of pT in\nFig. 134. Notice that the color dipole picture accounts only for Pomeron exchange from\nthe target, while ignoring its valence content. Therefore, Reggeons are not taken into account,\nand as a consequence, the dipole is well suited mainly for high-energy processes. As our\nresult for RHIC and CDF energies indicate, we expect that dipole prescription to be at work\nfor the LHC energies. At the Tevatron, in order to reject the overwhelming background of\nsecondary photons isolation cuts are imposed [372]. Isolation conditions are not imposed\nin our calculation. However, the cross section does not vary by more than 10% under CDF\nisolation conditions [370]. One should also notice that the parametrizations of the dipole cross\nsection and proton structure function employed in our computation have been fitted to data at\nconsiderably lower pT values [370].\n8.8. Thermal Dileptons at LHC\nH. van Hees and R. Rapp\nWe predict dilepton invariant-mass spectra for central 5.5 ATeV Pb-Pb collisions at LHC.\nHadronic emission in the low-mass region is calculated using in-medium spectral functions of light\nvector mesons within hadronic many-body theory. In the intermediate-mass region thermal radiation\nfrom the Quark-Gluon Plasma, evaluated perturbatively with hard-thermal loop corrections, takes over.\nAn important source over the entire mass range are decays of correlated open-charm hadrons, rendering\nthe nuclear modification of charm and bottom spectra a critical ingredient.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n166\n\nDue to their penetrating nature, electromagnetic probes (dileptons and photons) are an\ninvaluable tool to investigate direct radiation from the hot/dense matter created in heavy-ion\ncollisions. At low invariant mass, M\u22641 GeV, the main source of dileptons is the decay of the\nlight vector mesons, \u03c1, \u03c9 and \u03c6, giving unique access to their in-medium spectral properties,\nmost prominently for the short-lived \u03c1 meson. If the chiral properties of the \u03c1-meson can be\nunderstood theoretically, dilepton spectra can serve as a signal for the restoration of chiral\nsymmetry at high temperatures and densities.\nWe employ medium-modified vector-meson spectral functions in hot/dense matter\nfollowing from hadronic many-body theory, phenomenologically constrained by vacuum \u03c0\u03c0\nscattering, decay branching ratios for baryonic and mesonic resonances, photo-absorption\ncross sections on nucleons and nuclei, etc. [374]. The resulting spectral functions, especially\nfor the \u03c1 meson, exhibit large broadening with little mass shift, with baryonic interactions\nas the prevalent agent, especially in the mass region below the resonance peaks. Note that\nCP invariance of strong interactions implies equal interactions with baryons and antibaryons.\nThus, even in a net-baryon free environment, the \u03c1 resonance essentially \"melts\" around the\nexpected phase transition temperature, T c \u2243180 MeV. Other sources of thermal dileptons taken\ninto account are (i) four-pion type annihilation in the hadronic phase (augmented by chiral\nvector-axialvector mixing) [375], which takes over the resonance contributions at intermediate\nmass, and (ii) radiation from the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), computed within hard-thermal\nloop improved perturbation theory for in-medium q-q\u0304 annihilation.\nThermal dilepton spectra are computed by evolving pertinent emission rates over the\ntime evolution of the medium in central 5.5 ATeV Pb-Pb collisions. To this end, we employ a\ncylindrical homogeneous thermal fireball with isentropic expansion and a total entropy fixed\nby the number of charged particles, which we estimate from a phenomenological extrapolation\nto be dNch /dy\u22431400. We use an ideal-gas equation of state (EoS) with massless gluons and\nN f =2.5 quark flavors for the QGP, and a resonance gas for the hadronic EoS with chemical\nfreezeout at (\u03bccB ,T c )=(2,180) MeV (finite meson and anti-/baryon chemical potentials are\nimplemented to conserve the particle ratios until thermal freezeout at T fo \u2243100 MeV, with a\nmass-action law for short-lived resonances). We start the evolution in the QGP phase at initial\ntime \u03c40 =0.17 fm/c, translating into T 0 \u2243560 MeV. The volume expansion parameters are taken\nto resemble hydrodynamic simulations. A standard mixed-phase construction connects QGP\nand hadronic phase at T c , and the total fireball lifetime is \u03c4fb \u224318 fm/c.\nAs for non-thermal sources, we include primordial Drell-Yan annihilation and decays\nof correlated charm pairs. The latter are estimated by scaling the spectrum at RHIC with a\ncharm-cross section anticipated at LHC, which implies somewhat softer charm spectra than\nexpected for primordial N-N collisions (and thus softer invariant-mass spectra). We neglect\ncontributions from jet-plasma interactions.\nOur predictions are summarized in Fig. 135. At low mass thermal dileptons are\ndominated by hadronic radiation, with large modifications due to in-medium vector-meson\nspectral functions. The QGP contribution takes over at around M&1.1 GeV. The yield\nfrom correlated open-charm decays is comparable to hadronic emission already at low mass,\nand dominant at intermediate mass.

Vitev\n\n\u221a\nBaseline direct photon production cross sections are studied in s = 5.5 TeV p+p collisions at the\nLHC. The fraction of fragmentation photons, which suffer QGP effects, is shown to be non-negligible\neven at very high pT \u223c 200 GeV. We first examine important cold nuclear matter effects for direct\nphoton production, related to dynamical shadowing, isospin and initial state energy loss, in comparison\n\u221a\nto neutral pion production at s = 200 GeV. Simulations of direct \u03b3 suppression in Pb+Pb reactions at\ns1/2 = 5.5 A.TeV at the LHC are also presented to high transverse momentum. Results are given in for\ncentral nuclear collisions and energy loss in the QGP calculated in the GLV approach. Direct photon\nquenching is shown to strongly depend on the ratio \u03b3prompt /\u03b3fragmentation At high pT > 100 GeV cold\nnuclear matter attenuation can be as large as the QGP effects for the net suppression of direct photons.\n\nIt has been argued that direct photon production and direct photon tagged jets provide\nerror-free gauge for the quenching of quarks and gluons and for fixing their initial energy.\nWe show that quantitatively large nuclear corrections must be taken into account for direct\n\u03b3 to become precision probes of the QGP. The left panel of Fig. 136 shows the direct\n\u221a\nphoton production cross section in p+p collisions at s = 5.5 TeV the LHC compared to\n\u221a\nthe corresponding cross section at RHIC s = 200 GeV to LO in perturbative QCD [376].\nInsert shows the fraction of fragmentation to prompt photons versus pT .

Comparison to data in\n0-20% central d+Au collisions at RHIC is also presented.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n168\n\nThe left panel of Fig. 137 shows the QGP effect (final-state interactions) in central Pb+Pb\n\u221a\ncollisions at s = 5.5 TeV. Parton rapidity densities dN g /dy \u223c 2000 \u2212 4000 [283], as for \u03c00\nquenching and heavy meson dissociation, are used. Direct photon quenching closely follows\nthe ratio \u03b3prompt /\u03b3fragmentation [376]. At low pT attenuation is QGP-dominated with significant\nand measurable suppression RAA (pT ) \u223c 0.5. Nevertheless, such quenching is smaller than\nthe one for \u03c00 's and reflects the C F /C A average squared color charge difference for quark\nand gluon jets. The right panel of Fig. 137 includes the effect of initial-state cold nuclear\nmatter energy loss. At high pT these can be comparable to the final-state quenching in the\nQGP [285, 376, 377].\n9.

While the fragments keep flying away from the interaction region\nessentially unaffected, a fraction of the initial angular momentum is transferred to the\ninteraction region. Much of it is probably spent into relative orbital angular momentum of\nthe newly formed fireballs at large rapidity, but it may happen that another significant fraction\nis given to the midrapidity region giving rise to a spinning plasma with an intrinsic angular\nmomentum J. If J is sufficiently large, one has remarkable observable effects. It has been\nsuggested that such a phenomenon can produce an azimuthal anisotropy in the transverse\nplane very similar to the well known elliptic flow [150]. Also, a large J may result in a\npolarization of emitted particles [378]. We make a quantitative determination of observable\neffects by assuming that the spinning system is at statistical equilibrium, taking advantage of\na recent calculation of the microcanonical partition function of a relativistic quantum gas with\nfixed angular momentum [379, 380] which allowed us to provide the expression of particle\nspin density matrix and polarization in a rotating thermodynamical system. Here, a possible\nscenario for the LHC energy is just sketched; a more detailed paper will appear [380].\nUnder reasonable assumptions, the main observables which signal the presence of\nan equilibrated spinning system are (see figure 138): a decrease of chemical freeze-out\ntemperature and an increase of transverse momentum spectra broadening (enhanced radial\nflow) as a function of centrality; a large enhancement of elliptic flow and a polarization of\nemitted particles along the direction of angular momentum. The latter is the cleanest signature\nof a spinning system. These observables scale with the parameter J/T c4 R4 , T c being the critical\ntemperature and R the maximal transverse radius of the system.

Black hole predictions for LHC\nH. St\u00f6cker and B. Koch\nThe speculative prediction of the production of microscopical black holes, which would be\npossible at the large hadron collider due to large extra dimensions, is discussed. We review observables\nfor such black holes and for the their possibly stable final state.\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n171\n\n9.2.1. From the hierarchy-problem to black holes in large extra dimensions One of the\nproblems in the search for a unified description of gravity and the forces of the standard model\n(SM), is the fact that the Planck-scale mPl \u223c 1019 GeV (derived from Newtons constant G N ) is\nmuch bigger than the energy scales like the Z-mass mZ \u223c 90 GeV. This huge difference is the\nso-called hierarchy problem. Several theories can explain this hierarchy by the assumption\nof extra spatial dimensions [381\u2013383]. These theories assume a true fundamental scale M f\nwhich is of the order of just a few TeV and they interpret the Planck scale mPl as an effective\nmagnitude which comes into the game due to unobservable and compactified extra spatial\ndimensions. In the model suggested by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali [381, 382]\nthe d extra space-like dimensions are compactified on tori with radii R. In this model the\nSM particles are confined to our 3+1-dimensional sub-manifold (brane) and the gravitons\nare allowed to propagate freely in the (3+d)+1-dimensional bulk. Planck mass mPl and the\nfundamental mass M f are related by\nd\nm2Pl = M d+2\nf R\n\n.\n\n(63)\n\nOne exciting consequence of such models is that up to 109 black holes (BH) might be\nproduced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [384]. The intuitive approximation of the cross\nsection for such events can be made by using the Hoop conjecture and taking the classical\narea of the (to be produced) BH with radius RH\n\u03c3(M) \u2248 \u03c0R2H\n\n,\n\n(64)\n\nwhere M is the BH mass. The Scharzschild radius is given at distances smaller than the size\nof the extra dimensions by\n!d+1\n1\nM\n2\nd+1\n.\n(65)\nRH =\nd +1 Mf\nMf\n\nThis radius is much larger than the Schwarzschild radius corresponding to the same BH mass\nin 3+1 dimensions, which translates directly into a much larger cross section (64). This estimate seems to keep its validity also in more elaborated picture .\n\n9.2.2. From black hole evaporation to LHC observables Once a BH is produced it is\nassumed to undergo a rapid evaporation process. This happens first in the so called\nbolding phase where angular momentum and internal degrees of freedom are assumed to\nbe radiated off. For a BH mass much bigger than the fundamental mass scale (M \u226b M f ) the\nfollowing phase is the Hawking phase, where particles are thermally radiated off according\nto the Hawking temperature \u2020\u2020 [385] T H \u2248 M f (M f /M)1/(d+1) . As soon as the BH mass\nbecomes comparable to the fundamental mass scale, the underlying physics of the BH is\nnot understood and exact predictions are hardly possible at the current state of knowledge.\nDiscussed scenarios reach from a sudden final explosion over a slowed down evaporation to\nthe formation of stable black hole remnant (BHR) As most BHs would be produced close to\n\u2020\u2020The process of Hawking radiation would in principle allow to transform the BH mass into thermal energy and\nwas therefore subject to further speculations\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n172\n\nthe production threshold the experimental outcome will be influenced strongly by this final\nphase of BH evolution.\nWe analyzed the predictions for different scenarios. It turned out that the, suppression of\nhard (TeV) di-jets above the BH formation threshold would be the most scenario independent\nobservable for the LHC. Other observables such as event multiplicities or pT distributions\nshould be definitely studied although they are more model dependent. Speculations about the\nformation of BHRs can be tested experimentally at the LHC: Charged stable BHRs would\nleave single stiff tracks in the LHC detectors. Uncharged BHRs with their very small reaction\ncross sections could be observed by searching for events with \u223c 1 TeV missing energy and\nquenching of the high pT hadron spectra. For further references on BHs, BHRs and their\nobservables please see [386].\nWe conclude that BHs at the LHC could provide a unique experimental window to the\nunderstanding of quantum gravity. As many principles of BH production and decay are not\nfully understood, a large variability of experimental observables is absolutely essential to pin\ndown the underlying physics.\n9.3. Charmed exotics from heavy ion collision\nS. H. Lee, S. Yasui, W. Liu and C. M. Ko\nWe discuss why charmed multiquark hadrons are likely to exist and explore the possibility of\nobserving such states in heavy ion reactions at the LHC.\n\nMultiquark hadronic states are usually unstable as their quark configurations are\nenergetically above those of combined meson and/or baryon states. However, constituent\nquark model calculations suggest that multiquark states might become stable when some of\nthe light quarks are replaced by heavy quarks. Two possible states that could be realistically\nobserved in heavy ion collisions at LHC are the tetraquark T cc (ud c\u0304c\u0304) [387] and the pentaquark\n\u0398cs (udusc\u0304) [388]. The driving mechanism for the stability of these states can be traced to\nP\nthe quark color-spin interaction, which can be effectively parameterized as C H i> j ~si * s~j mi1m j .\nBaryon mass splittings between states sensitive to the color-spin interaction are well explained\nwith a single constant coefficient CmB2 = 193 MeV [389]. Similarly, corresponding meson mass\nu\n\nsplittings are well reproduced with CmM2 = 635 MeV [389]. Hence, the correlation energy\nu\nin a quark-antiquark pair is about a factor 3 larger than that in a quark-quark pair that is\nin the color antitriplet channel. For heavy quarks, the size of the relative wave function\ndecreases substantially, and the parameter C H extracted from the mass difference between\nJ/\u03c8 and \u03b7c is Cmcc\u03042 = 117 MeV. As in the case of light quarks, we choose Cmcc2 = 13 Cmcc\u03042 = 39 MeV.\nc\nc\nc\nThese numbers suggest that two quarks and two antiquarks would rather become two mesons\nthan form a single tetraquark state. However, when one or both of the antiquarks become\nheavy, the attractions to form mesons are relatively suppressed compared to the strong diquark\ncorrelation among light quarks, making multiquark states possibly stable. Using the constants\nC H discussed above, we find that the mass of T cc (\u0398cs ) is -79 MeV below (8 MeV above) its\nhadronic decay threshold. These results are well reproduced by full constituent quark model\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n173\n\ncalculations. Although the binding becomes larger when the c quark is replaced by a b quark,\nthe expected number of b quarks produced in a heavy ion collision at the LHC is small for\na realistic observation of such states. Therefore, we only give predictions for the multiquark\nstates containing c quarks.\nEmploying the coalescence model [390], we have studied T cc and \u0398cs production in\ncentral Au+Au collisions at RHIC and Pb+Pb collisions at LHC. Using the u (or d) quark\nnumbers 245 and 662, the anti-strange quark numbers 150 and 405, and the charm quark\nnumbers 3 and 20 based on initial hard collisions at RHIC and LHC, respectively all in one\nunit of midrapidity, we find that the numbers of T cc produced at RHIC and LHC are about\n5.4 \u00d7 10\u22126 and 8.9 \u00d7 10\u22125, respectively, while those of \u0398cs are about 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 8.3 \u00d7 10\u22124,\nrespectively. Since these numbers are significantly smaller than 7.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 8.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 for\nT cc , and 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22122 for \u0398cs from the statistical hadronization model for RHIC\nand LHC, respectively, we expect additional production of these exotic charmed hadrons from\nthe hadronic stage of the collisions. We note that these charmed hadrons would be more\nabundantly produced, particularly the T cc , if charm quarks are produced from the QGP formed\nin these collisions.\nTable 9: Possible decay modes of T cc .

Alignment as a result from QCD jet production or new still unknown physics at the\nLHC?\nI. P. Lokhtin, A. M. Managadze, L. I. Sarycheva and A. M. Snigirev\nWe would like to draw attention of the high-energy physics community to very important\nexperimental results indicating our lack of understanding of features of hadron interactions at superhigh energies and the necessity of improving recent theories.\n\nThe intriguing phenomenon of the strong collinearity of cores in emulsion experiments,\nclosely related to coplanar scattering of secondary particles in the interaction, has been\nobserved a long time ago. So far there is no simple satisfactory explanation of these cosmic\nray observations in spite of numerous attempts to find it (see, for instance, [391, 392] and\nreferences therein). Among them, the jet-like mechanism [393] looks very attractive and\ngives a natural explanation of alignment of three spots along a straight line which results from\nmomentum conservation in a simple parton picture of scattering.\nIn the Pamir experiment [391] the families with the total energy of the \u03b3-quanta larger\nthan a certain threshold and at least one hadron present were selected and analyzed. The\nP\nalignment becomes apparent considerably at E \u03b3 > 0.5 PeV (that corresponds to interaction\n\u221a\nenergies s \u2265 4 TeV). The families are produced, mostly, by a proton with energy \u2265 104 TeV\ninteracting at a height h of several hundred meters to several kilometers in the atmosphere\nabove the chamber [391]. The collision products are observed within a radial distance rmax up\nto several centimeters in the emulsion where the spot separation rmin is of the order of 1 mm.\nOur analysis [394, 395] shows that the jet-like mechanism can, in principle, attempt to\nexplain the results of emulsion experiments. For such an explanation it is necessary that\nparticles from both hard jets (with rapidities close to zero in the center-of-mass system) hit the\nobservation region due to the large Lorentz factor under the transformation from the center\u221a\nof-mass system to the laboratory one. This is possible when the combination of h, s and\nrmax meets the following condition:\n\u221a\n2hm p/ s \u2264 krmax ,\n(66)\nwhere m p is the proton mass. k \u223c 1/2 is needed in order to have particles with adjoint positive\nand negative rapidities in the center-of-mass system that hit the detection region. At the height\nh = 1000 m (mostly used in emulsion experiment estimations) and rmax = 15 mm the condition\n\u221a\n(66) is fulfilled at the energy s \u2265 270 TeV that is much higher than the LHC energies\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns \u2243 5.5 \u00f7 14 TeV and the threshold efficient interaction energies seff \u2243 4 TeV [391, 392],\ncorresponding to the alignment phenomenon. Eq. (66) can be fulfilled and at the LHC energy\n(14 TeV) also, but at the considerably lesser height h \u2264 50 m which is in some contradiction\nwith emulsion experiment vague estimations.\nOn the other hand if particles from the central rapidity region and the jet-like mechanism\nare insufficient to describe the observed alignment, and there is another still unknown\n\u221a\nmechanism of its appearance at the energy s \u223c 5.5 \u00f7 14 TeV and the accepted height\nh \u223c 1000 m, then in any case some sort of alignment should arise at the LHC too in the\n\n\fHeavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions\n\n175\n\nmid-forward rapidity region (following from the laboratory acceptance criterion for, e.g., pp\ncollisions) [394, 395]:\nrmin < ri =\u21d2 \u03b7i < \u03b7max = ln(r0 /rmin ) \u2243 4.95,\n\n(67)\n\nri < rmax =\u21d2 \u03b7i > \u03b7min = ln(r0 /rmax ) \u2243 2.25,\n\n(68)\n\nwhere r0 = 2h/e\u03b7o , \u03b70 = 9.55 is the rapidity of center-of-mass system in the laboratory\nreference frame, \u03b7i is the particle rapidity in the center-of-mass system, ri is the radial particle\nspacing in the x-ray film. Namely, at the LHC the strong azimuthal anisotropy of energy\nflux (almost all main energy deposition along a radial direction) will be observed for all\nevents with the total energy deposition in the rapidity interval (67, 68) larger than some\nthreshold \u223c 1 TeV. Stress once more that at present there are no models or theories giving such\nazimuthal anisotropy following from the experimentally observed alignment phenomenon at\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns \u2265 seff \u2243 4TeV and h \u223c 1000 m [391, 392].\nThis mid-forward rapidity region must be investigated more carefully on the purpose to\nstudy the azimuthal anisotropy of energy flux in accordance with the procedure applied in the\nemulsion and other experiments, i.e. one should analyze the energy deposition in the cells\nof \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03c6-space in the rapidity interval (67, 68). Note that the absolute rapidity interval can\nbe shifted in correspondence with the variation of the height: it is necessary only that the\ndifference (\u03b7max \u2212 \u03b7min ) is equal to \u2243 2.7 in accordance with the variation of radial distance by\na factor of \u223c 15 (rmax /rmin = 15 independently of r0 (h)) due to the relationship ri \u2243 r0 /e\u03b7i .\nSuch an investigation both in pp and in heavy ion collisions (to differentiate between\nhadronic and nuclear interaction effects) at the LHC can clarify the origin of the alignment\nphenomenon, give the new restrictions on the values of height and energy, and possibly\ndiscover new still unknown physics.\nAcknowledgements\nThe research of J.
