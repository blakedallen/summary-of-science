Suicide has been\nassociated with psychiatric illnesses such as depression and schizophrenia, as well as\neconomic uncertainty, and social/cultural factors. This study proposes a neuroeconomic\nframework of suicide. Neuroeconomic parameters (e.g., risk-attitude, probability\nweighting, time discounting in intertemporal choice, and loss aversion) are predicted to\nbe related to suicidal behavior. Neurobiological and neuroendocrinological substrates\nsuch as serotonin, dopamine, cortisol (HPA axis), nitric oxide, serum cholesterol,\nepinephrine, norepinephrine, gonadal hormones (e.g., estradiol and progesterone),\ndehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in brain regions such as the orbitofrontal/dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex and limbic regions (e.g., the amygdala) may supposedly be related to\nthe neuroeconomic parameters modulating the risk of suicide. The present framework\nputs foundations for \u2015molecular neuroeconomics\u2016 of decision-making processes\nunderlying suicidal behavior.\nKeywords: Suicide, Neuroeconomics, risk, intertemporal choice, discounting\n\n\f1. Introduction:\nAs the global annual rate of suicide approximates 15 per 100,000 individuals, it is\nestimated that one million people worldwide commit suicide each year. Annual rates of\nnon-fatal suicidal behaviour are 10\u201320 times higher than those of completed suicide\n(Kerkhof, 2000). Suicidal behavior thus constitutes a major public health problem. This\nindicates the necessity of effective theoretical frameworks for suicide prevention.\nDuring the past 30 years, economists have contributed insights about the economic\nmotivations underlying suicidal behavior. Hamermesh and Soss (1974) formalized a\nmodel of the utility maximization decision faced by those contemplating suicide. Their\npaper, and subsequent work by economists, developed the notion that suicide occurs\nwhen the temporally-discounted stream of expected utility (subjective well-being) over\na person's lifetime is sufficiently low, perhaps negative, by assuming the subject's\ndecision-making is rational. However, recent studies in behavioral economics and\nneuroeconomics revealed that people are irrational in terms of economic theory.\nTherefore, introducing neuroeconomic frameworks is important for a better\nunderstanding of suicidal behavior. Also, recent neurobiological studies on suicidal\nbehavior demonstrated that several neurobiological substrates such as serotonin,\ndopamine, and neuroactive steroid hormones in the brain regions such as the prefrontal\ncortex and the limbic structures are important determinants of suicidal behavior.\nTherefore, combining neuroeconomic theory with these neurobiological finding is\nnecessary to establish molecular neurobiological theory of suicidal behavior\n(\u2015molecular neuroeconomics\u2016 of suicide).\nThis paper is organized in the following manner. In Section 2, I briefly\nintroduce neuroeconomic theory of decision under risk and over time, and economic\ntheory of suicidal behavior. In Section 3, findings in neurobiology regarding the\nmolecular mechanisms of suicidal behavior are briefly reviewed. In Section 4, I\nproposed several predictions from molecular neuroeconomic theory of suicidal behavior.\nSome conclusions from this study and future study directions by utilizing the present\nmolecular neuroeconomic theory, and how to test the present theory experimentally in\nfuture neuroeconomic studies are also discussed.\n2. Neuroeconomic theory of risky and impulsive decision making\n2.1 Decision under risk\nIn behavioral economics, decision under risk is formulated with Kahneman-Tversky's\nprospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). In prospect theory, a subjective value\nof an uncertain outcome x which is received at the probability of p is v(x) w( p) , where\n\n\fv(x) is a value function and w( p) is a probability weighting function. The prospect\n\ntheory's value function is assumed to be concave for gains, convex for losses, and\nsteeper for losses than for gains. The most popular parametrization of the value function\nis a power function (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992):\n\uf061\n\uf0ec\n\uf0ef x ( x \uf0b3 0)\nv( x) \uf03d \uf0ed\n\uf062\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ee\uf02d \uf06c (\uf02d x) ( x \uf03c 0)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 > 0 measure the curvature of the value function for gains and losses, and \u03bb is\nthe coefficient of loss aversion. A recent neuroeconomic study demonstrated that\namygdale damage reduced loss aversion (De Martino et al., 2010). The probability\nweighting function has been parametrized as (Prelec, 1998; Takahashi, 2011):\n(2)\nw( p) \uf03d exp[ \uf02d(\uf02d ln p) s ]\nwhere s indicates a distortion in subjective probability (note that s=1 corresponds to\nlinear probability weighting), which has been shown to associate with the anterior\ncingulate activity (Paulus and Frank, 2006)\nIn economic theory of suicidal behavior, income uncertainty and the costs of\nmaintaining oneself alive have been associated with suicide (Hamermesh and Soss,\n1974; Marcotte, 2003; Suzuki, 2008), implying that subjects with strong loss aversion\nand risk aversion are more likely to commit suicide (Yamawaki et al., 2005). Hence, it\ncan be supposed that smaller \u03b1 <1 (i.e., strong risk aversion in gain), larger \u03bb (i.e.,\nstrong loss aversion) and s may be associated with suicidal behavior. The contribution\nof parameter \u03b2 which determines risk-attitude in loss should also be examined, because\nJollant et al., (2010) reported that suicidal behavior is associated with disadvantageous\ndecision-making in a gambling task involving loss and a decreased activation in the\norbitofrontal cortex (Jollant et al., 2010).\n2.2 Decision over time (intertemporal choice)\nIn order to describe impulsivity and irrationality in temporal discounting, the\nq-exponential time-discount model for delayed rewards has been introduced and\nexperimentally examined (Cajueiro, 2006; Takahashi, 2007; Takahashi et al., 2007a;\nTakahashi et al., 2008ab; Takahashi, 2009):\nVq+(D)= Vq+ (0)/ expq+(kq+D)= Vq+ (0)/[1+(1-q+)kq+D]1/(1-q+)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Vq+(D) is the subjective value of a reward obtained at delay D, q+ is a parameter\nindicating irrationality in temporal discounting for gain (smaller q+<1 values\ncorrespond to more irrational discounting for delayed gains), and kq+ is a parameter of\n\n\fimpulsivity regarding the reward at delay D=0 (q-exponential discount rate at delay\nD=0). Note that when q+=0, equation 3 is the same as a hyperbolic discount function,\nwhile q+\u21921, is the same as an exponential discount function (Cajueiro, 2006;\nTakahashi, 2009). Kable and Glimcher (2007) reported that Vq+(D) is\nneurally-represented in brain regions such as the striatum.\nFurthermore, it is known that delayed gains and losses are distinctly processed\nin the brain and loss is less steeply temporally-discounted than gains, which is referred\nto as the \u2015sign effect\u2016 (Xu et al., 2009). Therefore, we should prepare the q-exponential\ndiscount function for delayed loss:\nVq-(D)= Vq- (0)/ expq-(kq-D)= Vq- (0)/[1+(1-q-)kq-D]1/(1-q-)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Vq-(D) >0 is the (absolute, unsigned) subjective value (subjective magnitude) of a\nloss at delay D (note that Vq-(D=0) = \u03bbVq+(D=0), from equation 1), q- is a parameter\nindicating irrationality in temporal discounting for loss (smaller q-<1 values correspond\nto more irrational discounting for delayed losses), and kq- is a parameter of impulsivity\nregarding the loss (i.e., degree of procrastination) at delay D=0. Our previous study\n(Takahashi et al., 2008b) demonstrated that depressive patients are more irrational in\nintertemporal choices for gain and loss than healthy controls. Also, a recent study\nreported that impulsive suicide attempters discount delayed rewards steeply\n(Dombrovski et al., 2011). These findings indicate that irrational suicidal behavior may\nbe associated with large k values and smaller q values across gain and loss. However, a\ndeliberate, forward-looking suicide attempt may be associated with less steeper\ntemporal discounting, because the weight of future loss is significant for a subject with\nsmaller kq-. Dombrovski and colleagues (2011) reported non-impulsive (planned) suicide\nattempts were associated with smaller time-discount rate (\u2015lethal foresight\u2016), supporting\nthis speculation. Tellingly, anhedonia was found to be related to slow temporal\ndiscounting behavior (Lempert and Pizzagalli, 2010), also consistent with this\nprediction.\n3 Neurobiological substrates of suicidal behavior\n3.1 Brain regions related to suicidal behavior\nSuicide has been associated with psychiatric illnesses such as depression and\nschizophrenia. Regarding neuroanatomy, abnormalities in white matter and limbic gray\nmatter appear to be associated with the occurrence of suicide attempts (van Heeringen et\nal., 2011). The orbitofrontal cortex, the cingulate cortex and the inferior parietal lobule\n\n\fmay be involved in response inhibition, disadvantageous decision-making in a gambling\ntask, and suicide attempts (Jollant et al., 2010; van Heeringen et al., 2011). Serotonergic\nfunctioning in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex correlates significantly with levels of\nhopelessness, a strong clinical predictor of suicidal behaviour (van Heeringen et al.,\n2003). The right amygdala hypertrophy may be a risk factor for suicide attempts\n(Spoletini et al., 2011). The left anterior limb of the internal capsule was further\nassociated with suicidal behavior (Jia et al., 2010).\n3.2 Serotonin and dopamine\nThe serotonergic system has been the most widely investigated neuromodulatory system\nin studies of suicide attempters and completers (Yanagi et al., 2005). CSF-5HIAA was\ncorrelated with depression and suicidal behavior (Asberg et al., 1976), although\ntryptophan hydroxylase isoform 2 gene is not related to suicide in Japanese population\n(Mouri et al., 2009). Our previous study (Takahashi et al., 2008b) reported that\ndepression is associated with steep temporal discounting in the near future, in line with\nthe finding. Also, taking SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) has been\nassociated with suicidal behavior (Dudley et al., 2010). Furthermore, mesolimbic\ndopaminergic transmission has been hypothesized to be reduced in depression and\nsuicide (Bowden et al., 1997). Suda et al. (2009) reported dopamine D2 receptor is\nassociated with suicide. Zhong et al., (2009) reported that serotonin and dopamine\ndetermine the shape of the value function in Kahneman-Tversky's prospect theory\n(equation 1); i.e., risk aversion and loss aversion. Furthermore, both serotonin and\ndopamine regulate temporal discounting (Takahashi, 2009). Therefore, involvement of\nserotonergic and dopaminergic systems in suicide should more extensively been studied\nby employing neuroeconomic frameworks in future studies. Also, nitric oxide is\ninvolved in synaptic neurotransmission and associated with suicide (Cui et al., 2010).\nIga et al., (2007) demonstrated that BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) is\nassociated with suicidal behavior. Therefore, the relation between synaptic\nneurotransmission and suicide should be examined.\n3.3 Epinephrine and norepinephrine\nAdrenaline (epinephrine) is synthesized from tyrosine and phenylalanine in both the\nadrenal gland and the brain, and is considered both a hormone and a neurotransmitter.\nAdrenaline is an activator molecule well known to induce several physiological effects\n(e.g., increased heart rate) and general cognitive enhancement (e.g., increased awareness\nand attention). Meana et al., (1992) reported an increase in alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the\nhypothalamus and frontal cortex in suicide victims. Consistent with the report, our\nprevious study (Takahashi et al., 2007b; Takahashi et al., 2010) demonstrated that high\n\n\flevel of noradrenergic activity is related to slow temporal discounting, which may result\nin an increase in the rate of deliberate suicide attempts (i.e., \u2015lethal foresight\u2016,\nDombrovski et al., 2010).\n3.4 Neuroactive steroid hormones\nThe hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis is the major biological infrastructure of\nthe human stress system with interconnections between the structures by the hormones\nCRH, ACTH, and cortisol (a type of glucocorticoids). The abnormalities in HPA may be\nrelated to suicide (Kunugi et al., 2004). The expression regulation of the hippocampal\nglucocorticoid receptor, a key component of the HPA axis, is decreased primarily among\nsuicides (McGowan et al., 2009). Supriyanto et al., (2011) reported a genotype of\nFK506 binding protein 5 is associated with suicidal behavior. Butterfield et al. (2005)\nreported that patients who had attempted suicide demonstrated significantly higher\nDHEA levels than those who had not attempted suicide, indicating the involvement of\nDHEA in suicidal behavior. Regarding gonadal steroids, low estradiol and progesterone\nlevels were observed to associate with suicidal behavior in women (Baca-Garcia et al.,\n2010). Our previous studies demonstrated that stress hormones modulate temporal\ndiscounting behavior (Takahashi, 2004; Takahashi et al., 2010). In males, testosterone is\nalso associated with temporal discounting (Takahashi et al., 2006). Therefore future\nstudies should investigate how these steroid hormones modulate neuroeconomic\nparameters, resulting in an exaggerated suicide rate. Furthermore, low serum cholesterol\nis associated with suicidal behavior (Kunugi et al., 1997).\n4. Implications for neuroeconomics and neurobiolgy of suicidal behavior\nThis study is the first to present a possible unified framework for molecular\nneuroeconomic theory of suicide. Our theoretical considerations lead us to the following\npredictions: (a) neurobiological substrates/alterations which increase loss aversion (\u03bb in\nequation 1) may increase suicide rates, (b) neurobiological substrates/alterations which\nincrease risk aversion (i.e., decrease \u03b1<1 in equation 1) may increase suicide rates, (c)\nneurobiological substrates/alterations which increase time-discount rate (k parameters in\nequation 3 and 4) and time-inconsistency (i.e., decrease q parameters < 1 in equation 3\nand 4) in intertemporal choice may increase impulsive suicide attempts, (d)\nneurobiological substrates/alterations which decrease time-discount rate (k parameters\nin equation 3 and 4) may increase deliberate, non-impulsive suicide attempt (\u2015lethal\nforesight\u2016). Moreover, because suicide attempts are associated with disadvantageous\ndecision-making in the gambling task involving loss (Jollant et al., 2010), it can be\npredicted that (e) neurobiological substrates/alterations which decrease risk aversion in\n\n\floss may increase the risk of suicidal behavior. Future neuroeconomic studies should\ninvestigate whether these predictions (a)-(e) are correct or not, at the molecular and\nneuronal level, in addition to the neuroanatomical level. Neuropsychopharmacological\ntreatments may especially be useful for the future investigations. Furthermore, some\neconomic theories incorporated social psychological and cultural factors such as self\nidentity and habit (Becker and Murphy, 2003; Akerlof and Kranton, 2000). These\nfactors, which may be important for a better understanding of suicidal behavior\n(Sakamoto et al., 2006), should be incorporated into neuroeconomic theory of suicide.\n\n\fReferences\nAkerlof GA, Kranton RE (2000) Economics and identity Quarterly Journal of\nEconomics 115, 715-775\nAsberg, M.
