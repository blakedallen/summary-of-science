First, we revisit the question of stability\nand find that, contrary to the claims of HMH, the states\nin the upper half of the Bloch sphere can be stabilized\nas well as those in the lower half (this is what was better than they realized). The only states which cannot\nbe stabilized, in the sense that an arbitrary initial state\nwould not always end up in the desired state, are those\non the equator of the Bloch sphere; that is, those which\nare equal superpositions of excited and ground states.\nOur second generalization is to consider how effective\nfeedback is with \u03b7 < 1; that is, with non-unit-efficiency\ndetection. In this case it is not possible to stabilize the\natom at any pure state, except the ground state which\nis trivially stable by setting the driving and feedback to\nzero. Instead, we aim to produce a steady state which\nis as close as possible to a given pure state. For the\ntwo-level atom, this is equivalent to trying to create a\nstate which is as pure as possible in a particular direction in Bloch space. Not surprisingly (given the above\nresult), we find that states near the equator cannot be\nwell-protected against decoherence. We also find an echo\nof the distinction HMH found between the upper and\nlower halves of the Bloch sphere, in that states in the\nupper half sphere are affected much more by loss of detection efficiency that those in the lower half.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we\npresent the model of a driven two-level atom, including the stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger equation for unit-efficiency\nhomodyne detection. In Sec. III we use this equation to\nderive the driving and feedback required to stabilize the\natom in an arbitrary pure state. These results agree with\nthose of HMH. However, our stability analysis disagrees\nsubstantially with theirs. In Sec. IV we present entirely\nnew analytical results relating to the effect of non-unitefficiency detection. In Sec. V we give numerical simulations of the stochastic evolution equations, illustrating\nthe issues discussed in the preceding two sections. In\nSec. VI we summarize and interpret our results, explain\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nAlthough classical models of feedback schemes have\nbeen used for a long time to control dynamical noise, an\nanalogous quantum theory of feedback has been developed only in the last fifteen years [1\u20137]. Recently there\nhas been considerable interest in quantum feedback as a\nway to fight decoherence in isolated quantum systems,\nusing the approach of Refs. [4,5]. The central idea is to\nuse a continuous measurement record, whose existence is\ndue to the coupling of the system to a bath, to control\nthe dynamics of the system so as to counteract the noise\nintroduced by that bath and possibly other baths. For\nexample, it has been suggested as a way to create optical\nsqueezed states [8], to create micromaser number states\n[9], to correct errors in quantum bits [10], and to protect\noptical and microwave Schr\u00f6dinger cat states against dissipation [11\u201313].\nDecoherence in quantum systems can be loosely defined as loss of purity. Therefore the ultimate success in\nusing feedback to fight decoherence would be to create an\narbitrary stable pure state in the presence of dissipation.\nThis goal was realized (better even that they realized)\nby Hoffman, Mahler and Hess (HMH) [14,15] for a very\nsimple system: a resonantly driven two-level atom. They\nshowed that by using the photocurrent derived from unitefficiency homodyne detection of the atom's fluorescence\nto control part of the driving field of the atom, it is possible to exactly cancel the noise introduced by the electromagnetic vacuum field when the atom is in a particular\npure state. By choosing the driving strength and feedback strength appropriately, any pure state on the Bloch\nsphere may be picked out, although HMH claimed that\nonly pure states on the lower half of the sphere would be\nstable under their scheme.\nHMH chose to describe detection and feedback in their\nsystem in a way different from (but equivalent to) the\nstandard approach in Refs. [4,5]. In this paper we reformulate their theory using the latter approach. This has\n1\n\n\fFIG. 1. Diagram of the experimental apparatus.

In this master equation\nwe have chosen to define the \u03c3x = \u03c3+\u03c3 \u2020 and \u03c3y = i\u03c3\u2212i\u03c3 \u2020\nquadratures of the atomic dipole relative to the driving\nfield. The effect of driving is to rotate the atom in Bloch\nspace around the y-axis. The state of the atom in Bloch\nspace is described by the three-vector (x, y, z). It is related to the state matrix \u03c1 by\n\u03c1=\n\n\u03b32\n\nI(t)\n\n\u03b2\n\nThe locus of solutions in this plane (an ellipse) is shown\nin Fig. 2. Since zss < 0, all solutions are in the lower\nhalf of the Bloch sphere. That is, we are restricted to\n|\u03b8| > \u03c0/2. Also, it is evident that the smaller |\u03b8| is (that\nis, the more excited the atom is), the smaller r is (that\nis, the less pure the atom is). At |\u03b8| = \u03c0 the stationary\nstate is pure, but this is not surprising as it is simply the\nground state of the atom with no driving. As |\u03b8| \u2192 \u03c0/2\nwe have r \u2192 0. This can only be approached asymptotically as |\u03b1| \u2192 \u221e. In summary, the stationary states we\ncan reach by driving the atom are limited, and generally\nfar from pure.\n\nLaser\n\n2\n\n\fthe photodetections goes to infinity and thus it should\nbe possible to change the point process of photocounts\ninto a continuous photocurrent with white noise.

Second, the subscript\nc means conditioned and refers to the fact that if one\nis making a homodyne measurement then this yields information about the system. Hence, any system averages will be conditioned on the previous photocurrent\nrecord.

Homodyne Detection\n\n(2.13)\n(2.14)\n\nSince the stationary solution of the master equation\nconfines the state to the x\u2013z plane, it makes sense to\nfollow HMH by setting \u03a6 = 0. In that case,\n\nNow consider subjecting the atom to homodyne detection. As shown in Fig. 1, we assume that all of the\nfluorescence of the atom is collected and turned into a\nbeam (represented in Fig. 1 by placing the atom at the\nfocus of a mirror). Ignoring the vacuum fluctuations in\n\u221a\nthe field, the annihilation operator for this beam is \u03b3\u03c3,\nnormalized so that the mean intensity \u03b3 \u03c3 \u2020 \u03c3 is equal\nto the number of photons per unit time in the beam.\nThis beam then enters one port of a 50:50 beam splitter, while a strong local oscillator \u03b2 enters the other. To\nensure that this local oscillator has a fixed phase relationship with the driving laser used in the measurement, it\nwould be natural to utilize the same coherent light field\nsource in the driving process and as the local oscillator\nin the homodyne detection. This is as shown in Fig. 1.\nAgain ignoring vacuum fluctuations, the two field operators exiting the beam splitter, b1 and b2 , are\n\u0002\u221a\n\u0003 \u221a\nbk =\n\u03b3\u03c3 \u2212 (\u22121)k \u03b2 / 2.\n(2.9)\n\nI(t) =\n\n\u221a\n\u03b3 h\u03c3x ic (t) + \u03be(t).\n\n(2.15)\n\nThat is, the deterministic part of the homodyne photocurrent is proportional to xc = h\u03c3x ic . This should be\nuseful for controlling the dynamics of the state in the\nx\u2013z plane by feedback, as we will consider in Sec. III.\nOf course, all that really matters here is the relationship\nbetween the driving phase and the local oscillator phase,\nnot the absolute phase of either.\nThe conditioning process referred to above can be\nmade explicit by calculating how the system state\nchanges in response to the measured photocurrent. Assuming that the state at some point in time is pure (which\nwill tend to happen because of the conditioning anyway),\nits future evolution can be described by the stochastic\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation (SSE) [17,18]\n\nWhen these two fields are detected, the two photocurrents produced have means\n\u0001\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b3\u03b2\u03c3 \u2020 + \u03b3\u03c3\u03b2 \u2217 + \u03b3\u03c3 \u2020 \u03c3 /2.\nI \u0304k = |\u03b2|2 \u2212 (\u22121)k\n\nd|\u03c8c (t)i = \u00c2c (t)|\u03c8c (t)idt + B\u0302c (t)|\u03c8c (t)idW (t). (2.16)\nThis is an It\u00f4 stochastic equation [19] with a drift term\nand a diffusion term. The operator for the drift term is\ni\n\u03b3h \u2020\n\u00c2c (t) =\n\u2212\u03c3 \u03c3 + h\u03c3x ic (t)\u03c3 \u2212 h\u03c3x i2c (t)/4 \u2212 i\u03b1\u03c3y ,\n2\n(2.17)\n\n(2.10)\nThe middle two terms represent the interference between\nthe system and the local oscillator.\nThe ideal limit of homodyne detection is when the local oscillator amplitude goes to infinity, which in practical terms means |\u03b2|2 \u226b \u03b3. In this limit, the rate of\n\nwhile that for the diffusion is\n3\n\n\fB\u0302c (t) =\n\n\u221a\n\u03b3 [\u03c3 \u2212 h\u03c3x ic (t)/2] .\n\nthe form (2.16). The effect of the feedback Hamiltonian\ncan be shown [4,8] to change the drift and diffusion operators to\ni\n\u03b3h \u2020\n2\n\u2212\u03c3 \u03c3 + h\u03c3x ic (t)\u03c3 \u2212 h\u03c3x ic (t)/4 \u2212 i\u03b1\u03c3y\n\u00c2c (t) =\n2\n\u0003\n\u221a \u0002\n+ \u03bb \u03b3 \u2212i h\u03c3x ic (t)\u03c3y \u2212 2\u03c3 \u2020 \u03c3 \u2212 \u03bb2 /2, (3.2)\n\u221a\nB\u0302c (t) = \u03b3 [\u03c3 \u2212 h\u03c3x ic (t)/2] \u2212 i\u03bb\u03c3y .\n(3.3)\n\n(2.18)\n\nBoth of these operators are conditioned in that they depend on the system average\nh\u03c3x ic (t) = h\u03c8c (t)|\u03c3x |\u03c8c (t)i.\n\n(2.19)\n\nOn average, the system still obeys the master equation\n(2.1). This is easiest to see from the stochastic master\nequation (SME), which allows for impure initial conditions. The SME can be derived from the SSE by constructing\nd (|\u03c8c ih\u03c8c |) = (d|\u03c8c i) h\u03c8c | + |\u03c8c i (dh\u03c8c |)\n+ (d|\u03c8c i) (dh\u03c8c |) ,\n\nSay we wish to stabilize the pure state with Bloch angle \u03b8, as defined in Eqs. (2.6) and (2.7), with r = 1 of\ncourse. In terms of the ground and excited states, this\nstate is\n\n(2.20)\n\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n|\u03b8i = cos |ei + sin |gi.\n2\n2\n\nusing the It\u00f4 rule (2.13), and then identifying |\u03c8c ih\u03c8c |\nwith \u03c1c . The result is\n\u221a\nd\u03c1c = dt\u03b3D[\u03c3]\u03c1c \u2212 idt\u03b1[\u03c3y , \u03c1c ] + dW (t) \u03b3H[\u03c3]\u03c1c ,\n\nNow for this state to be stabilized we must have\nh\ni\n\u00c2c (t)dt + B\u0302c (t)dW (t) |\u03b8i \u221d |\u03b8i.\n\n(2.21)\nwhere H[A]B \u2261 AB + BA\u2020 \u2212 Tr[AB + BA\u2020 ]. Although\nthis has been derived assuming pure initial conditions,\nit is valid for any initital conditions [18]. This is also an\nIt\u00f4 equation, which means the evolution for the ensemble\naverage state matrix\n\u03c1(t) = E[\u03c1c (t)]\n\n(3.5)\n\nWe cannot say the left-hand-side should equal zero because a change in the overall phase still leaves the physical state unchanged. However, we can work with this\nequation, and simplify it by dropping all terms proportional to the identity operator in \u00c2c (t) and B\u0302c (t). We\ncan also demand that it be satisfied for the deterministic\nand noise terms separately, because dW (t) can take any\nvalue. This gives the two equations\n\n(2.22)\n\nis found simply by averaging over the photocurrent noise\nterm by using Eq. (2.14). This procedure yields the original master equation (2.1) again. The general term for\nthe stochastic conditioned evolution of the system, be it\ndescribed by a SSE or SME, is a quantum trajectory [17],\nand the quantum trajectory is said to unravel the master\nequation [17].\n\n\u221a\n( \u03b3\u03c3 \u2212 i\u03bb\u03c3y ) |\u03b8i \u221d |\u03b8i,\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u03b3 \u2212\u03c3 \u2020 \u03c3 + sin \u03b8\u03c3 \u2212 i2\u03b1\u03c3y\n\u0001\u0003\n\u221a\n+ \u03bb \u03b3 \u2212i sin \u03b8\u03c3y /2 \u2212 \u03c3 \u2020 \u03c3 |\u03b8i \u221d |\u03b8i,\n\n(3.6)\n(3.7)\n\nwhere we have put h\u03c3x ic (t) equal to sin \u03b8, its value for\nthe state |\u03b8i.\nSolving the first equation easily yields the condition\n\nIII.

SSE including feedback\n\n(3.8)\n\nThis is equivalent to the feedback condition derived by\nHMH, stated as Eq. (35) of Ref. [15]. Substituting this\ninto the second equation gives, after some trigonometric\nmanipulation, the second condition\n\nWe now include feedback onto the amplitude of the\ndriving on the atom, proportional to the homodyne photocurrent, as done by HMH. This is as shown in Fig. 1,\nwhere the driving field passes through an electro-optic\namplitude modulator controlled by the photocurrent,\nyielding a field proportional to \u03b1 + \u03bbI(t). This means\nthat the feedback can be described by the Hamiltonian\nHfb = \u03bb\u03c3y I(t).\n\n(3.4)\n\n\u03b1=\n\n\u03b3\nsin \u03b8 cos \u03b8.\n4\n\n(3.9)\n\nAgain, this agrees with the driving strength of HMH,\ngiven as Eq. (44) of Ref. [15]. It is worth emphasizing\nthat the derivation given here is entirely different in detail from that of HMH, and so is an independent verification of their result. These functions are plotted in Fig. 3.\nNote that there are two points with the same values of\nboth \u03bb and \u03b1, at \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03c0/2.\n\n(3.1)\n\nIn this paper we are assuming instantaneous feedback,\nwhere the time delay in the feedback loop is negligible.\nSince the homodyne photocurrent (2.11) is defined in\nterms of system averages and the noise dW (t), the SSE\nincluding feedback can still be written as an equation of\n4\n\n\fto be norm-preserving). It is not difficult to find these\neigenvalues, and in terms of \u03b8 they are\n\n1\nr2\n\n\u2212 \u03b3/2, \u2212\u03b3/2, \u2212\u03b3 cos2 \u03b8.\n\n\u03bb, \u03b1, and r2\n\n0.5\n\nEvidently the state |\u03b8i will be stable for all \u03b8 except\n\u03b8 = \u00b1\u03c0/2. That is, all states are stable except those\non the equator. This is contrary to the conclusion of\nHMH [15], based on a linearized stability analysis, that\n\"long term stability of . . . inverted states [i.e. states in\nthe upper half plane] cannot be achieved.\" We emphasize\nthat our stability analysis contains no approximations.\nIn hindsight, the lack of stability for pure states on\nthe equator could have been predicted from the expressions (3.8) and (3.9). As discussed above and shown in\nFig. 3, the values for driving and feedback for \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 are\nthe same as those for \u03b8 = \u2212\u03c0/2. This means that both\n\u03c1 = |\u03c0/2ih\u03c0/2| and \u03c1 = |\u2212\u03c0/2ih\u2212\u03c0/2| are solutions of\nL\u03b8 \u03c1 = 0 for \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 or \u2212\u03c0/2. By linearity, any mixture\nof |\u03c0/2ih\u03c0/2| and |\u2212\u03c0/2ih\u2212\u03c0/2| will be a solution also.\nHence any deviation away from one of these pure state\nwill not necessarily be suppressed, and the system lacks\nstability. With random external perturbations, the system will eventually reach an equal mixture of |\u03c0/2ih\u03c0/2|\nand |\u2212\u03c0/2ih\u2212\u03c0/2|, which is a state with r = 0 (minimum\npurity). This is why we have plotted a value of r = 0 in\nFig. 3 for |\u03b8| = \u03c0/2. We also plot r as a function of \u03b8\nin Bloch space in Fig 2, giving the locus of states which\ncan be stabilized by feedback. This can compared to the\nlocus of the mixed states which are accessible by driving\nalone. We will return to the stability issue in the context\nof stochastic dynamics in Sec.

Plot of the optimal driving (\u03b1, solid) and feedback\n(\u03bb, dashed) required to produce a pure state with Bloch angle\n\u03b8. For this plot we have set \u03b3 = 1 so that \u03b1 and \u03bb are dimensionless. The purity (r 2 , starred) is one except for \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03c0/2,\nwhere the feedback is not stable.\n\nB. Stability\n\nThe preceding derivation seems to show that any pure\nstate can be stabilized by a suitable choice of driving\nand feedback. Indeed our derivation proves that that if\none prepares a state in exactly the pure state one desires, then the feedback scheme of HMH which we have\nanalyzed will keep the system in that state. However,\nto discuss stability we need to know what will happen\nfor states which are not initially in the desired state. To\ndeal with this it is much more convenient to use the SME\nrather than the SSE, as will become apparent.\nThe SME can be constructed from the SSE in the same\nway as before. The result is [4,8]\n\nIV. FEEDBACK WITH NON-UNIT-EFFICIENCY\nDETECTION\n\nWe have seen that the stochastic master equation is a\nvery useful representation of a quantum trajectory, as it\nallows the unconditioned (deterministic) master equation\nto be derived easily, and this latter equation is all that\nis required for a completely rigorous stability analysis.\nThe SME is also superior to the SSE in that allows inefficient detection to be described. In a real experiment\nthis has to be taken into account. The effect of non-unit\n\u03b7 on feedback in the present system is of interest both\nin itself, and because of the extreme nonlinearity of the\nsystem dynamics as compared to other quantum optical\nfeedback systems such as considered in Ref. [8].\nAs explained in Ref. [18], the homodyne photocurrent\nfrom a detection scheme with efficiency \u03b7 is\n\u221a\n\u221a\nI(t) = \u03b3 h\u03c3x ic (t) + \u03be(t)/ \u03b7.\n(4.1)\n\nd\u03c1c = dt\u03b3D[\u03c3]\u03c1c \u2212 idt\u03b1[\u03c3y , \u03c1c ]\n\n\u2212 idt\u03bb[\u03c3y , \u03c3\u03c1c + \u03c1c \u03c3 \u2020 ] + dt(\u03bb2 /\u03b3)D[\u03c3y ]\u03c1c\n\u221a\n+ dW (t)H[ \u03b3\u03c3 \u2212 i\u03bb\u03c3y ]\u03c1c .\n(3.10)\n\nAlso as before, this is an It\u00f4 stochastic equation, which\nmeans that the ensemble average can be found simply by\ndropping the stochastic terms. This time, the result is\nnot the original master equation, but rather the feedbackmodified master equation\n\u221a\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212i[\u03b1\u03c3y , \u03c1] + D[ \u03b3\u03c3 \u2212 i\u03bb\u03c3y ]\u03c1 \u2261 L\u03c1.\n\n(3.12)\n\n(3.11)\n\nHere we have put the Liouvillian superoperator L in a\nmanifestly Lindblad form.\nNow we have shown already that the pure state \u03c1 =\n|\u03b8ih\u03b8| must be a solution of this master equation, for the\nappropriate choices of \u03bb (3.8) and \u03b1 (3.9). But for it to\nbe a stable solution we require all of the eigenvalues of\nthe resulting L\u03b8 to have a negative real part (except for\nthe one eigenvalue that is always zero, as required for L\u03b8\n\nHere we have used a normalization such that the deterministic part does not depend on \u03b7. The effect of decreased efficiency is increased noise. This means that\nwe can retain the same feedback Hamiltonian as above\n(3.1), without changing the significance of the feedback\n5\n\n\fFirst, and most obviously, the degree of purity (measured\nby the r, the distance from the origin) decreases with \u03b7.\nSecond, the gap at the equator for \u03b7 = 1 quickly widens,\nso that the purity of the best states with \u03b8 close to \u03c0/2\nis small. Third, the purity of the best states in the upper\nhalf of the Bloch sphere is affected much more by loss of\ndetection efficiency than those in the lower half. Fourth,\nin the limit \u03b7 = 0, the best solutions correspond to the\nno-feedback solutions shown in Fig. 2. This is not surprising, since with \u03b7 = 0 the photocurrent contains no\ninformation about the system (as the noise is infinitely\nlarge) and hence there is no point doing feedback. Since\nthe stationary states with no feedback are confined to the\nlower half of the Bloch sphere, this explains why the best\nstates with feedback in the lower half are less affected as\n\u03b7 decreases than those in the upper half.\n\nparameter \u03bb.

(2.21), can be\nobtained simply by setting \u03bb = 0, and was derived in\nRef. [18].\nOnce again, it is easiest for the moment to just consider the ensemble average evolution by averaging dW to\nzero. The Lindblad form of the resulting master equation\nis\n\u221a\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212i[\u03b1\u03c3y , \u03c1] + D[ \u03b3\u03c3 \u2212 i\u03bb\u03c3y ]\u03c1 + (\u03bb2 /\u03b7)D[\u03c3y ]\u03c1. (4.3)\nWe do not know a priori what values of \u03bb and \u03b1 to\nchoose to give the best results with inefficient detection,\nas the SSE analysis in Sec. III A obviously does not apply. Hence we simply solve for the stationary matrix in\nterms of \u03b1 and \u03bb.

We cannot hope anymore to produce stable pure states anywhere on the Bloch\nsphere. However, we can pick a direction \u03b8 on the Bloch\nsphere and ask how close can we get to a pure state?\nThat is, we use the radius r in Eq. (2.6) and Eq. (2.7)\nas the quantity to be maximized, for each \u03b8. From these\ntwo equations we have\ntan \u03b8 = xss /zss .\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\n0\nX\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFIG. 4.

By comparing this plot with Fig. 3 one obtains\nsome idea of the effect of inefficient detection. A number\nof features remain the same. First, \u03b1 is antisymmetric\nin \u03b8, while \u03bb is symmetric. Recalling that the deterministic part of the feedback is proportional to \u03bb h\u03c3x ic , the\nfeedback itself is actually antisymmetric as well as the\ndriving. Second, the magnitude of the feedback is zero\nfor |\u03b8| = \u03c0 (the ground state) and increases monoton\u221a\nically to a maximum of \u03b3 at \u03b8 = 0 (in the direction\nof the excited state). Third, the driving is zero at the\nground state and at \u03b8 = 0, and also changes sign as one\npasses through the equatorial place. The most obvious\ndifference between the parameters for \u03b7 = 1 and those for\n\u03b7 = 0.8 parameter is that the latter have a discontinuity\nat |\u03b8| = \u03c0/2. The feedback parameter \u03bb jumps as one\n\n\u00bfFrom Eqs. (4.4) and (4.6) we can immediately find the\ndesired driving in terms of \u03bb and \u03b8 as\n\u221a \u221a\n\u221a\n\u2212 \u03b3\u03b7( \u03b3 + 2\u03bb)(\u03b3\u03b7 + 4 \u03b3\u03b7\u03bb + 4\u03bb2 ) tan \u03b8\n\u03b1=\n.

III, both the deterministic and stochastic dynamics disappeared in the\nsteady state for the appropriate choice of \u03b1 and \u03bb. Because the stationary solution of the SSE was a unique\npure state, that was necessarily also the stationary solution of the master equation found by averaging over the\nnoise in the equivalent SME. Thus there was no distinction between the unconditioned and conditioned states.\nThere are two exceptions to this lack of distinction. The\nfirst is in the transients, before the system reaches its\nsteady state. The second is for the special case |\u03b8| = \u03c0/2.\nIn this subsection we investigate these exceptions.\n\n0\n\u03b1\n\n\u22120.5\n\u03bb\n\u22121\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\u03b8\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFIG. 5.

A typical trajectory for \u03b8 = \u03c0/6 is shown in Fig. 6(a). We see that the\ninitial evolution is very erratic, but that on a time scale\nof a few \u03b3 \u22121 the system relaxes towards a steady state\nwhich is pure and stationary. By t = 10\u03b3 \u22121 the system\nis locked in a stable pure state for all intents. We have\nalso illustrated another typical trajectory in Bloch space,\nin Fig. 7.\n\nHere the three eigenvalues in Eq. (3.12) are clearly evident. Both zc and yc will decay to zero (as required for\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/2), and their noise terms vanish at that point. By\ncontrast, the equation for xc is independent of the others,\nand is purely stochastic:\n\u221a\ndxc = \u03b3dW (t)(1 \u2212 x2c ).\n(5.6)\n\n1\n\nClearly the equatorial pure states with xc = \u00b11 are\nstationary solutions to this problem. Also, the system\nwill tend to one of these states. We can see this by calculating\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(5.7)\ndE[x2c ] = \u03b3dtE (1 \u2212 x2c )2 ,\n\n0.5\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0/6\n\n0\n\nwhich is always positive. That is, on average x2c always\nincreases. But it is also clear that xc has no preference\nto go to either of these states. Hence they are not stable.\nThe ensemble average x is unchanging under this evolution. Thus a perturbation which moves the state from\nxc = 1 to xc = 1 \u2212 \u01eb say, will result in a proportion \u01eb/2\nof the states ending up at xc = \u22121, and a proportion\n1 \u2212 \u01eb/2 ending up at xc = 1.\nWe have illustrated these features by showing two typical trajectories in Fig. 6(b). Once again, the initial evolution is highly erratic, but the system reaches a fixed\npoint on a time scale of a few \u03b3 \u22121 . However, with the\nsame initial condition (the ground state), one trajectory\nends up at xc = 1 and the other at xc = \u22121.\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\nX\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFIG. 7. Typical quantum trajectories in Bloch space for\nt \u2208 [0, 10\u03b3 \u22121 ] under optimal feedback for \u03b8 = \u03c0/6, starting at\nthe ground state. The plusses are for \u03b7 = 1 and the dots for\n\u03b7 = 0.8. The locus for the deterministic stationary states for\n\u03b7 = 0.8 are also shown; the relevant state for this quantum\ntrajectory is at the intersection of the locus and the ray at\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/6. Note that the quantum trajectory for \u03b7 = 0.8 wanders around this average position, while that for \u03b7 = 1 stops\nprecisely at the desired pure steady state.\n\nC. Non-unit-efficiency\n\nIn the unit-efficiency case the stationary solution of the\nmaster equation is (except for |\u03b8| = \u03c0/2), a pure state.\nThis is very special in that in means that every unraveling of the master equation as a SSE or SME must end up\nin this same pure state also. For non-unit-efficiency we\nhave found the most pure stable state for each \u03b8. In this\ncase we must use a SME to unravel the master equation,\nsince the conditioned state will not be pure in general,\nbecause of the inefficient detection. Since the deterministic steady state is not pure (except for |\u03b8| = \u03c0), the\nquantum trajectories need not end up in this state. Instead, the quantum state in an individual trajectory may\ncontinue to evolve stochastically even when the system is\nin steady state, and the equivalence to the deterministic\nevolution may hold only on average. On the other hand,\nit is also possible that the quantum trajectories do all\nend up in the deterministic steady state, since we expect\nthe conditioned state to be mixed anyway.\n\nIt is easy to verify that by putting \u03b7 = 1 and\n(xc , yc , zc ) = (sin \u03b8, 0, cos \u03b8)\n\n(5.4)\n\nin the right-hand-side of the SBE (5.2), we obtain complete cancellation. If we wish, we can follow HMH and\nseparate the noise term into the contribution from feedback (proportional to \u03bb) and that contribution present\neven without feedback (the rest). We interpret the latter\nstochasticity as being due to the quantum measurement\nwe are making, with its underlying probabilistic nature.\nObviously the fluctuation due to measurement is canceled\nby the feedback, as HMH point out. It is equally important that the deterministic dynamics are also canceled at\nthis point.\nThe story for the special case \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 is quite different.\nFor this case the SBEs are\n8\n\n\fstates on the equator. Although they are fixed points of\nthe dynamics, they are not stable. A small perturbation\naway from one fixed pure state leads to a proportionally\nsmall fraction of the ensemble ending up in the diametrically opposite pure state.\nIt is nevertheless possible to obtain an asymmetry between the upper and lower halves of the Bloch sphere,\nreminiscent of the conclusion of HMH, if one considers\ndetection efficiencies less than one. In this case, it is no\nlonger possible to stabilize the system in a given pure\nstate, so we choose the feedback and driving so that the\nsolution of the master equation (including feedback) is\nas close as possible to a given pure state. We find that\nthe purity (which measures this closeness) of states thus\nproduced decays to zero as \u03b7 decreases to zero, for states\nin the upper half of the Bloch sphere. By contrast, those\nin the lower half do not decay to zero. This is readily\nunderstandable since in the absence of feedback (which\nis the situation which must prevail when the detection\nefficiency goes to zero), the master equation with driving\nalone has stationary solutions in the lower-half plane with\nnon-zero purity. The purity decays most rapidly with \u03b7\nfor states near the equator, which is unsurprising given\nthe instability of states on the equator even for \u03b7 = 1.\nIn the non-unit-efficiency case, the state of the system\nconditioned on the homodyne measurement results continues to evolve stochastically even in the long-time limit,\nwhere the ensemble average evolution has reached the desired most-pure state. Moreover, it seems that any other\nchoice of driving and feedback will result in more, not\nless, randomness in the steady-state quantum trajectory.\nOur results are significant in a number of ways. First,\nthey show the power of the quantum trajectory and master equation techniques developed in Refs. [4,8,5]. Those\ntechniques were particularly useful for illuminating subtle questions regarding the stability of pure states, and\nfor treating inefficient detection. Second, the physical\nsystem (the two-level atom) may one day find application as a quantum bit in quantum information technology [20]. In that eventuality, the ability to stabilize the\natom against dissipation in an arbitrary (known) pure\nstate may be useful. Third, the system is a simple but\nnon-trivial example of quantum feedback in a nonlinear\nsystem (the two-level atom). Thus the effectiveness of\nfeedback, and in particular the influence of non-unit- efficiency detection on this effectiveness, is of interest for\nwhat it may tell us about other more complicated nonlinear systems.\nIn this last context, it would be of interest to also consider the effect of non-Markovian feedback; that is, feedback with a time delay or non-flat loop response function.\nThis is much more difficult to treat than Markovian feedback because the Lindblad master equations derived in\nRefs. [4,8,5] do not apply. Analytical solutions for nonMarkovian feedback are possible for linear systems [8,21].\nFor a nonlinear system like the two-level atom, numerical simulations, or novel analytical approaches, are necessary. This is an issue we plan to explore in future work.\n\nIt turns out that with the optimal values of \u03b1 and \u03bb\ndefined in Sec. IV, the actual behaviour is the first option described above. That is, the system state continues\nto vary stochastically in the long time limit, but is constrained so that the time-averaged state is equal to the\nsolution of the deterministic master equation. We show\nthis in Bloch space Fig. 7 for \u03b7 = 0.8 and \u03b8 = \u03c0/6. We\nsee that the amount of randomness in the system state\nin the long-time limit is quite large even for fairly high\n\u03b7.\nThis result suggests another question: would a different choice for \u03bb be able to reduce, or even eliminate, the\nrandomness in the steady-state quantum trajectory, even\nthough it would necessarily be at the expense of the purity of the deterministic stationary solution. [Recall that\nfor a given \u03bb, \u03b1 is still necessarily fixed by Eq. (4.9).] To\ntest this idea we tried choosing \u03bb based not on maximizing r2 as in Eq. (4.10), but on minimizing\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a \uf8f62\n\u2212 \u03b3\u03b7x2ss + ( \u03b3\u03b7 + 2\u03bb/ \u03b7)zss + \u03b3\u03b7\n\u221a\n\uf8f8 .\n\u2212 \u03b3\u03b7xss yss\nN\u03b8 (\u03bb) = \uf8ed\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2212( \u03b3\u03b7 + 2\u03bb/ \u03b7)xss \u2212 \u03b3\u03b7xss zss\n\uf8eb\n\n(5.8)\nThat is, we minimize the noise terms in the SBE\nEq. (5.2). Note that we have replaced the conditioned\nBloch variables xc etc. with the deterministic stationary solutions xss etc., and that the dependence of these\nstationary solutions on \u03b1 and \u03bb add a further, implicit,\ndependence on \u03bb to N\u03b8 (\u03bb). This is a sensible procedure\nif the aim is realizable, and the noise in the solutions\nis reduced or eliminated so that the conditioned states\nare approximately or exactly equal to the deterministic\nstationary solution.\nIt turns out that this procedure cannot significantly reduce the amount of steady-state randomness in the quantum trajectories below that resulting from minimizing\nthe deterministic stationary purity. In fact, for all values\nof \u03b7 we considered, the variation of \u03bb (as a function of \u03b8)\nbased on minimizing the noise was indistinguishable by\neye from that based on maximizing the purity. This is\nnot too surprising, but could not have been predicted a\npriori.\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have given a rigorous analysis of the antidecoherence feedback scheme proposed by Hofmann,\nMahler and Hess [15]. They proposed modulating the\ndriving of a two-level atom using the instantaneous homodyne photocurrent, in order to stabilize the atom in\nan arbitrary known pure state. We have shown that, for\ndetection efficiency \u03b7 = 1, the pure states thus produced\nare stable. This is contrary to the conclusion of HMH,\nthat only pure states in the lower half of the Bloch sphere\nwould be stable. The one exception we found is for pure\n9\n\n\f[8] H.M. Wiseman and G.J.
