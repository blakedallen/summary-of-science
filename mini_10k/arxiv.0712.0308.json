Rectifying mechanisms or ratchets have been used to explain how protein motors work2,3 and to design new\nseparation techniques4 or synthetical chemical motors5,6 .\nSuperconductors have become a powerful tool to study\nratchet mechanisms7 . Recently, a superconducting vortex ratchet device has been reported by Villegas et al8 . In\nthat experiment, the rocking ratchet mechanism is due to\na superconducting film patterned with a lattice of asymmetric potentials acting as pinning centers. An input ac\ncurrent yields an output dc voltage in the superconducting film, revealing a rich phenomenology of single and\nmultiple current reversals8,9,10 , very sensitive to the underlying vortex dynamics. The interest of vortex ratchets is then twofold: it reveals new collective rectification\nmechanisms and sheds light on the physics of vortices in\nsuperconductors.\nCurrent reversals in vortex ratchets have been explained, in the framework of one-dimensional models, by\nthe coexistence of pinned and interstitial vortices moving in opposite directions8 or by the interaction between\nvortices within the pinning centers in one-dimensional\nchannels9 . Olson and Reichhardt11 have studied numerically a two-dimensional model, obtaining current reversal\nonly when interstitial vortices are present in the ground\nstate. They provide intuitive explanations of different\nrectification mechanisms based on local interactions between vortices and pinning centers.\nIn this Letter we experimentally show that current reversal can also occur when interstitial vortices are absent\nin the ground state (T=0). Remarkably, current reversal disappears increasing either the pinning strength or\nthe temperature. We also present numerical simulations\nof vortices as interacting Brownian particles in two dimensions, indicating that this current reversal is due to\na new collective effect: an instability of the ground state,\nselective to the sign of the applied force. The influence of\nlattice instabilities on rectification has been also recently\nanalyzed by Lu et al.12 , for two dimensional vortices in\n\na substrate with a one-dimensional modulation.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nFor our experiments, two types of asymmetric pinning\ncenters have been fabricated: magnetic (Ni) nanotriangles and non-magnetic (Cu) nanotriangles. The vortex\npinning force is enhanced by magnetic centers in comparison with non-magnetic centers13 . The nanotriangles\nwere fabricated using e-beam lithography techniques and\nSi (100) wafers as substrates. The Ni or Cu arrays of\nnanotriangles, on top of the substrate, are covered with\na sputtered Nb thin film. Ni or Cu thickness (triangles\nheight) is 40 nm and Nb film is 100 nm thick. Further details on this fabrication technique can be found\nelsewhere14 . For the present work, we have fabricated\narrays with the same nanotriangle dimensions and array\nperiodicity than those in Ref. 8.\nWe have measured magnetotransport in these films using a commercial He cryostat. The variable temperature insert allows controlling temperature with stability\nof 1 mK. For these experiments, samples were patterned\nwith a cross-shaped measuring bridge8 , by using optical\nlithography and ion-etching. This patterned bridge allows us to control the Lorentz force on the vortices in the\nmixed state: taking into account F~L = J~ \u00d7 ~n\u03c60 (with\n\u03c60 = 2.07 \u00d7 10\u221215 Wb and ~n a unitary vector parallel to\nthe applied magnetic field). On the other hand, from the\n~ = B\n~ \u00d7 ~v , where B\n~ is\nexpression for the electric field E\nthe applied magnetic field and ~v the vortex-lattice velocity, we can calculate this velocity v = V / (dB) from the\nmeasured voltage drops V (d being the distance between\ncontacts). See Ref. 8 for more experimental details.\nThe dc magnetoresistance in the mixed state of samples with periodic arrays of pinning centers exhibits wellknown commensurability phenomena15,16 , in which minima develop as a consequence of geometrical matching\nbetween the vortex-lattice and the underlying periodic\nstructure. These minima are equally spaced (two neighbor minima are always separated by the same magnetic\nfield value). For example, in the case of square arrays\n\n\f2\nof nanostructured pinning centers, minima appear at applied magnetic fields Hm = n(\u03c60 /a2 ), where a is the lattice parameter of the square array. Hence, the number of\nvortices n per array unit cell can be known by simple inspection of the dc magnetoresistance R(H) curves. Moreover, for non-magnetic pinning centers Mkrtchyan and\nShmidt17 have given a rough estimation of the maximum\nnumber of vortices that can be pinned in each center,\nwhich could confirm the matching field minima values.\nThis filling factor can be calculated as the ratio between\nhalf the dimension of the pinning center (the triangle side\nis around 650 nm)8 and two times the superconducting coherence length (around 60 nm for these samples\nand temperatures close to the critical temperature)16 .\nIn our samples this rough estimation gives us approximately three vortices per triangle, in agreement with the\nmatching field data (see also 8). Therefore, we know, for\nselected values of the applied magnetic field, how many\nvortices there are per unit cell and where they are, this is,\nif they are interstitial vortices or vortices in the pinning\ncenters.\n\n(a)\n\n0\n(b)\n\nWe want to underline that collective behavior of vortices in films with periodic pinning is crucial to understand vortex lattice reconfiguration effects18 or vortex\nchanneling19 . Also, collective effects in ratchets have\nbeen shown to yield new interesting phenomena20 .\n\nMeasurements of the vortex lattice average velocity as\na function of the applied force are depicted in Fig. 1(a)\nfor sample (A), Ni triangles, and three vortex per triangle\n(n = 3). There is no current reversal in the rectified\nsignal in agreement with the explanation given in Ref. 8\n(see below). Experiments for sample (B), Cu triangles,\nalso for n = 3 (Fig. 1(b)) show a similar behavior for\nT = 8.165K ( T = 0.99 Tc), but a current reversal appears\ndecreasing the temperature, despite the fact that there\nare still three vortices per triangle.\n\nIn the one-dimensional approach reported in Ref. 8,\nthe vortex lattice does not play any role, and the current\nreversal was explained assuming that pinned and interstitial vortices are rectified in opposite directions. However, this assumption fails to explain current reversal for\nthe matching field n = 3, since in this case there are\nno interstitial vortices in the ground state of the system.\nThe simulations performed by Olson and Reichhardt11\ndo not exhibit any current reversal for n = 3 and the\nrectification mechanisms that they propose do not apply\nfor this case either. Therefore, a new explanation of current reversal is required. We have found by numerical\nsimulations such an explanation based on the interplay\nbetween the vortex lattice and the geometry of the triangular defects.\n\nFIG. 1: Net velocity of vortices versus ac Lorentz force amplitude (\u03c9 = 10kHz).

The pinning force and vortex-vortex interaction must be in agreement with the experimental situation of three vortices per\npinning site (triangle). The interaction of the vortices\nwith the pinning defects is modelled by a potential Vp\nin the shape of a triangle and with a hyperbolic tangent\nprofile.

Experiments22,23 show that the system is\nadiabatic in the region of frequencies used. This allows\nus to obtain the expected ac signal from the velocityforce response curves obtained in simulations, both for\nconstant positive and negative applied force.\nResults are shown in Fig. 2 where a window of downward rectification can be observed. Let us stress at\nthis point that the \"natural\" direction of rectification\nfor pinned vortices is upwards. The reason is that the\nvortex feels a smaller force at the tip of the triangle than\nat the triangle base. The force at the tip can be, for an\nequilateral triangle, as lower as half the force at the base\nof the triangle.\n\nB.\n\nGround state instability\n\nWhat is then the origin of the downward rectification\nfor small forces? Our simulations indicate that the rectification is due to a two-dimensional instability of the\nground state under small downward forces. The ground\nstate of the system consists of vortices located in the corners of each triangle, without interstitial vortices. However, for finite temperature, there are some \"defective triangles\" in the actual configuration of vortices, i.e., some\ntriangles which have only two vortices inside. Accordingly, some interstitial vortices will be randomly spread\nalong the sample. Fig. 3 shows one of these configuration with only one defective triangle out of 6 \u00d7 6. For low\nforces, motion is induced by the interstitial vortices both\nin the downward and upward direction. However, contrary to the picture presented in previous works8, there is\nnot a continuous motion of interstitial vortices along the\nspace between triangles: the interstitial vortex enters the\nnearest triangle expelling one of the three vortices inside.\nThe aforementioned instability, selective to the sign of\nthe external force, is shown in Fig. 3. We have chosen an\ninitial condition with only one interstitial vortex and one\n\nt =\u03c4\n\nFIG. 3: Downward rectification mechanism at T = 0 K: snapshots from simulations. Initial condition (left) and configurations after evolution (\u03c4 = 6.5 \u00d7 10\u22129 s) with positive force\nF = 0.032pN (right, up) and negative force \u2212F (right, down).\nDashed circles show the defective triangle and the only interstitial present in the initial condition. Thick arrows point out\nthe only two columns presenting any motion when positive\nforce is applied. Comparison of the right panels shows that\nthe number of interstitial vortices (\u00d7) dramatically increases\nwhen the external force points downwards.\n\ndefective triangle, located at some distance. In the right\nfigures we have plotted the configurations of vortices after an upward and downward force has been applied for\n\u03c4 = 6.5 \u00d7 10\u22129 seconds (long enough for a depinned vortex to cover the whole sample several times), respectively.\nThis simulations evolved at zero temperature to show the\nmechanism in a clearer manner. We see that, in the case\nof the upward force, the interstitial vortex remains in one\nsingle column. The column with a defective triangle also\nmoves, but again vortices remain in that column. As a\nconsequence, there is a positive current of vortices but\nthe motion is constrained to two columns. When the interstitial vortex enters a triangle, the top vortex in the\ntriangle moves upwards, out of it and into the following\none. In addition to that, in the defective triangle, one\nof the two vortices always escapes through the tip, becoming and interstitial vortex and triggering a process\nsimilar to that in the column with an extra vortex. Both\nmotions propagate along the column without disturbing\nthe neighboring columns.\nOn the other hand, under a downward force, the initial defect in the ground state propagates along the whole\nsample, as it is clearly shown in Fig. 3. A more detailed\nanalysis of the simulations show that, when an interstitial\nvortex enters a triangle, one of the two bottom vortices\nis expelled but now can move to a triangle in one of the\nnearest columns.

Consequently, the initial defect is then spread out along the\nhorizontal direction, yielding a considerable large fraction\nof depinned vortices which increase the overall motion in\nthe system, yielding a net downward rectification and the\ncorresponding current reversal.\nAs was noted before, current inversion may disappear\nwhen the pinning potential is increased. This effect was\nobserved in experiments where the Cu triangles were replaced by Ni ones which have a higher pinning strength\n(see Fig. 1(a)), and it is also reproduced in our simulations. Results for pinning potential Vp0 = 0.0036pN\u03bcm\ndo not show current reversal, as depicted in the inset\nin Fig. 2.

In other words, for\nthese moderate values of the force, the instability appears\nin both directions.\nFinally, current reversal in sample (B), Cu triangles,\nalso vanishes when temperature is raised (see Fig. 1(b)).\nWe can explain this behavior taking into account that the\npenetration depth of the superconductor increases with\ntemperature. As a result, the vortex-vortex interaction\nstrength, Uvv , decreases at short distance but its range\nbecomes longer21 , as depicted in Fig. 4. In this case we\nobserve that the long range vortex lattice order precludes\nthe instability responsible for current reversal (see the\ninset in Fig. 4).\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, our simulations show that the asymmetric substrate induces an instability sensitive to the\ndirection of the external force, affecting rectification.\nThis effect can explain the current reversal observed in\nour experiments for n = 3. Moreover, our work indicates that the lattice configuration, and consequently\nits dynamical properties, can be controlled by external forces. This interplay between rectification, driving\nforces and lattice configuration can induce other interesting phenomena such as transitions between different\nlattice configurations10, and could help to design new\nrectifying devices, not only in superconducting films, but\nalso in other two dimensional collective systems, such as\nJosephson arrays or colloidal suspensions.\nWe acknowledge support by Spanish Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n y Ciencia (NAN04-09087, FIS05-07392, MAT0523924E, MOSAICO), CAM (S-0505/ESP/0337) and\nUCM-Santander.
