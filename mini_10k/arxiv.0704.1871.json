Introduction\nThe interest in the impact of the cosmological expansion on bound astrophysical system\ncan be traced back to the paper by Einstein and Straus [1]. Over the subsequent years\ndifferent approaches have been used to gain some insight into the interplay between\ncosmology and astrophysical structures [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. With the advent of the discovery of\nthe accelerated Universe [7], it seems timely to pick up the topic once again and contrast\nthe effects of different models which can explain the current accelerated phase. Indeed,\nin [8] such an examination was performed for phantom [9] and quintessence cosmologies\n[10]. In the present article we will use the same approach as [2] and [8] and apply\nit to models with a positive cosmological constant and Chaplygin gas models. These\ntwo models will serve us as representatives for cosmological models which can explain\nthe current stage of acceleration. In addition we will also invoke a general model with\nvariable equation of state of the form \u03c9x = px /\u03c1x (DECDM). The approach mentioned\nabove consists in generalizing the Newtonian limit by allowing terms which are specific\nto the background cosmology. This is not limited to the inclusion of the cosmological\nconstant. Notice that the effects of the background cosmology on bound systems are now\nin general time dependent. This is, however not in contradiction with the fact that we\nrightly consider most of the astrophysical structures to be in gravitational equilibrium.\nThe time dependent background cosmology will not tear the system apart, unless its\ndensity is diluted, but change only, over cosmological time, the internal properties of\nthe system (like inner velocities or angular velocity etc). As a mathematical tool we will\nmake use of the virial theorem ([11] for different methods) by allowing certain internal\nproperties to be time dependent. The virial theorem can be easily derived even in the\npresence of the cosmological background as the latter enters only the Newtonian limit\n(i.e. the Poisson equation for the gravitational potential which includes now a time\ndependent part).\nAs shown in [12] Dark Energy can affect certain astrophysical static properties\nwhich have to do with either the virialization of the system [13] or the motion of\ntest bodies [2]. For instance, the cosmological constant sets itself scales of distance\n(r\u039b = \u039b\u22121/2 ) \u2021, time and mass, which are of the same order of magnitude as the radius\nof the observed universe, the age of the universe and the total mass of the universe (the\nso called coincidence problem). At the first glance it looks hopeless to expect any effects\nfrom \u039b at astrophysical scales. This is so indeed as long as no other scale enters the\ntheory. If the latter appears in the theory a combination of the large cosmological and\nthe small internal scale can yield values of astrophysical relevance (e.g. (rs r\u039b )1/3 where\nrs is the Schwarzschild radius) [14]. Furthermore, general conditions for detecting the\neffects of variations of 'constants' represented by scalar fields (just like the cosmological\nconstant and quintessence models) at scales ranging from terrestial scales have been well\nestablished in [15, 16, 17]. Another enhancement mechanism of background cosmology\nemerges when we are dealing with non-spherically symmetric objects. In such case\n\u2021 We work in the so-called geometrized units, i.e. GN = c = 1\n\n\fFrom Global to Local Dynamics: Effects of the Expansion on Astrophysical Structures 3\nthe ratio of two length scales to some positive power (bigger than one) goes often\nhand in hand with \u039b. For this reason, in examining time dependent effects, we will\nmostly employ ellipsoidal configurations. For general consideration of equilibrium in\nthe spherical case see [18] and [19], the quasi spherical case has been discussed in [20].\nIn this paper, we will entirely concentrate on effects of Dark Energy followed over\ncosmological times, past and future. We do not expect these effects to be large, however,\nwe think that it is of some importance to probe into these matter, especially in view of\nthe accelerated universe. In [21] we restricted ourselves to effects over small time scales.\nIn this sense these two articles complement each other.\n2. Local dynamics with background cosmology\nIn standard cosmology, the universe is described as an ideal fluid which implies the\nproperties of homogeneity and isotropy. Such properties are mathematically represented\nin Friedman-Robertson-Walker line element, which is written for a flat universe as ds2 =\n\u2212dt2 + R2 (t) (dr2 + r2 d\u03a92 ). Einstein field equations and the FRW line element yields\nthe acceleration equation and the well known Friedman equation, written respectively\nas\n\"\n\n\u1e58(t)\nR(t)\n\n#2\n\n8\n= H(t)2 = \u03c0\u03c1b (t),\n3\n\n4\nR\u0308(t)\n= \u2212 \u03c0 [\u03c1b (t) + 3pb (t)] ,\nR(t)\n3\n\n(1)\n\nIn conventional cosmology, the total energy density \u03c1b is a contribution of a radiation,\ncold dark matter and dark energy. By neglecting interaction among these components,\neach one evolves through the conservation equation \u03c1\u0307 = \u22123H(\u03c1 + p), so that radiation\nscales as \u03c1rad = \u03c1rad (R = 1)R\u22124 , cold dark matter scales as \u03c1cdm = \u03c1cdm (R = 1)R\u22123 ,\nwhile the Dark Energy component associated with the cosmological constant is \u03c1vac =\nconstant. The major contribution in connection to the cosmological constant is\napproximately 70% of total energy density [7].\n2.1. Dark energy\nAs pointed before, almost the 70% of the content of energy density in the unverse is\nruled by a dark energy component, and astronomical observations imply that at the\npresent time this dark energy component might be represented by the cosmological\nconstant. That is, at the present time, the equation of state that displays the best\nfit with astronomical observation is simply pvac = \u2212\u03c1vac , i.e, \u03c9 = \u22121. Nevertheless,\nseveral models has been proposed in order to reproduce the present value of dark\nenergy but maintaining a time dependent energy density. One generalizes the equation\nof state for the dark energy by px (R) = \u03c9x (R)\u03c1x (R). Dark energy then scales as\n\u03c1x (R) = \u03c1x (R = 1)a\u2212f (R) , where the function f (R) is defined as\nf (R) \u2261\n\n3\nln R\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nR\n\n\u03c9x (R\u2032 ) + 1 \u2032\ndR ,\nR\u2032\n\n(2)\n\n\fFrom Global to Local Dynamics: Effects of the Expansion on Astrophysical Structures 4\nThe model is constrained by requiring that at the present time the dark energy density\nreproduces the vacuum energy density associated with the cosmological constant, that is,\n\u03c1x (R = 1) = \u03c1vac . As pointed before, the case \u03c9x = \u22121 corresponds to the cosmological\nconstant \u03c1x = \u03c1vac = \u039b/8\u03c0, while for 0 > \u03c9x > \u22121 one stands in the Dark Energy\nrealms. Models with \u03c9x < \u22121 lead to future singularities in the so called Phantom regime\n[9]. The description of a dynamical dark energy is compatible with the description of\ninflationary models.\nIn the DECDM model, the Friedmann equation and the acceleration equation are\nwritten as\n\u1e58(t)\nR(t)\n\n!2\n\n= H02 \u03a9vac h1 (R)\n\nR\u0308(t)\n8\n= \u2212H02 \u03a9vac h2 (R) = \u2212 \u03c0\u03c1vac h2 (R).(3)\nR(t)\n3\n\nThe functions h1,2 (R) are given as\n\u03a9cdm \u22123\nh1 (R) \u2261\nR + R\u2212f (R) ,\n\u03a9vac\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 \u03a9cdm \u22123\n\u2212f (z)\nh2 (R) \u2261\nR +R\n(1 + 3\u03c9x (R)) ,\n2 \u03a9vac\n\n(4)\n\n2.2. Chaplygin Gas\nThe main stages the universe has passed through in the standard cosmology scenario can\nbe reproduced by the introduction of the equation of state of an exotic ideal relativistic\ngas written as\n\u03ba2\n(5)\npch = \u03ba1 \u03c1ch \u2212 \u03b3 ,\n\u03c1ch\nThe relevance of this equation of state lies in three different facts: a) it violates the\nstrong energy condition, which is necessary to obtain an accelerated phase at the present\ntime b) it generates a well definite speed of sound, which is relevant for the process of\nstructure formation and c) it unifies the early radiation or dark-matter behavior with\nthe late dark energy dominance. The so-called pure Chaplygin gas is obtained with\n\u03ba1 = 0 and \u03b3 = 1.\nThe time evolution of the Chaplygin Gas-energy density is given from the integration\nof mass-energy conservation equation as\nh\n\n\u03c1ch (R) = A + BR\u2212n\u03b2\n\ni1\n\n\u03b2\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwith n = 3(1 + \u03ba1 ), \u03b2 = \u03b3 + 1 and where A and B are integration constants given as\n3\n3\nB = \u03c1ch (R = 1)\u03b2 \u2212 A,\nA = \u03ba2 \u2261 \u03b1n H02\u03b2 ,\n(7)\nn\nn\nwith \u03c1ch (R = 1) = \u03c1crit as the Chaplygin Gas energy density at the present time (only\nfor a flat universe). In order to write the integration constants as we have done, we\nhave re-parametrized the Chaplygin Gas equation of state with \u03ba2 = \u03b1n H02\u03b2 such that a\nfinite age and a present accelerated phase for the Chaplygin gas universe is reached for\nn 3\n\u03b1n <\n3 8\u03c0\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u03b2\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\n\fFrom Global to Local Dynamics: Effects of the Expansion on Astrophysical Structures 5\nThis bound can be derived after integration of the Friedmann equation\ni1\n\u1e582\n8 h\n(9)\nH(R) = 2 = \u03c0 A + BR\u2212n\u03b2 \u03b2 .\nR\n3\nin order to determine the age of the universe.

For the pure Chaplygin gas one then obtains a finite age and the\nobserved acceleration at the present time only if the parameter \u03b1 is such that \u03b13 < 10\u22122 ,\nwhich in turn implies a bound on the Chaplygin parameter \u03ba2 < \u03c12crit . This warranties\nthat the equation of state is \u03c9ch (today) > \u22121.\nThe solution given in Eq.(6) allows us to describe the behavior of Chaplygin gas at\ndifferent ages. For early times the \u03ba1 -term dominates and Chaplygin Gas behaves as\n\u03c1ch = B 1/\u03b2 R\u2212n . This scales as radiation for n = 4 (\u03ba1 = 1/3). Hence we could\nin principle relate the integration constant B with cosmological parameters of the\nconcordance model as B = \u03c1\u03b2rad (R = 1). For \u03ba1 = 0, the model displays a matter\ndominated epoch at early times with \u03c1ch \u2248 B 1/\u03b2 R\u22123 . In this case one can write the\nintegration constant B = \u03c1\u03b2mat (R = 1) and also the constant A as A = \u03c1\u03b2crit (1 \u2212 \u03a9\u03b2mat ).\nFinally for large times, Chaplygin gas acquires a vacuum-like behavior with\n3\u03b1n 1/\u03b2 2\nH0 .\n(11)\n\u03c1ch (t \u2192 \u221e) = A =\nn\nThis would lead to an effective vacuum energy density \u03c1eff\nvac which can be associated to\nthe current vacuum energy density \u03c1vac via\n1/\u03b2\n\n\u03c1eff\nvac\n\n\"\n\n= \u03c1vac \u03a9vac\n\n\u0012\n\nB\n1+\nA\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u00131/\u03b2 #\u22121\n\n(12)\n\nWith \u03c1eff\nvac > \u03c1vac , the effects of this effective vacuum energy density may be relevant in\nthe Newtonian limit when we explore the equilibrium conditions of large scale structures.\nLet us concentrate on the case \u03ba1 = 0, which does not reproduce an early radiation\ndominated era but still unifies an early dark matter dominance and a vacuum dominated\nera at large scale factors.

The total energy density within the clustered configuration \u03c1 is a contribution\nof the background \u03c1b and the collapsed fraction \u03b4\u03c1.

The last term of Eq.(15) reduces to \u03c1vac for \u03c9x = \u22121 and\nnegligible contribution from the cold dark matter component, that is, for low red-shifts.\nThis limit represents the Newton-Hooke space time, which aside from the gravitational\ninteraction has an external force of the Hooke form \u223c \u039br 2 .\nGravitational equilibrium is represented through Euler equation \u03c1u\u0307 = \u2212\u2207p \u2212 \u03c1\u2207\u03a6,\nwhere \u03c1 is given by Eq.(16).

As usual, the set of equilibrium equations\nis closed with the equation for mass conservation, energy conservation and an equation\nof state p = p(\u03b4\u03c1, s).\nThe tensor virial equation can be thought as a differential equation for the moment\nof inertia, which in turns is converted to a differential equation for the parameters\ndetermining the geometrical properties of the configuration.

Nevertheless, we can use equation (21) by\nassuming that as long as R evolves in time, the configuration evolves through successive\nstates of equilibrium.\nThe expressions derived in the last section, specially (15) and (21) can be used for\ntesting dark energy models on configurations in equilibrium.

Even though\nwe will not make extensive use of these new equations, we want to demonstrate that the\nequilibrium condition is not a necessary ingredient while studying the effects of different\nbackground cosmologies. The results are differential equation for the geometrical\nparameters of a given configuration. Our starting point is equation (20). In the first\napproach, we will concentrate on pressurless systems with homogeneous density. The\nproblem is the reduced to determine a1 = a1 (R) and a3 = a3 (R).

Conclusion\nIn this article we have examined the effects of the expansion of the Universe on certain\nquasi-static properties of large astrophysical bodies. We have done this by invoking a\ndynamical equilibrium i.e. the time dependent response of the astrophysical objects to\nthe time dependent cosmological background is taken into account by allowing some\ninternal properties to become epoch dependent. In spite of the fact that the expansion\nof the Universe is accelerated the effects are rather small, at the most few per cents over\na large cosmological time stretch in the case of the Chaplygin gas model. However, a\nqualitative investigation, done in the present paper, seems mandatory to establish the\n\n\fFrom Global to Local Dynamics:Effects of the Expansion on Astrophysical Structures14\nsize of the effects. Different equations of state can be clearly distinguished theoretically,\nhowever, in practice this would require a good knowledge of the angular velocities at\ndifferent redshifts. In spite of the smallness of the effects, the results clearly demonstrate\nthat background cosmology affects, in principle, local properties of astrophysical bodies\nand furthermore, the details of these effects are model-dependent. In this paper, we\nfocused on the the dynamical equilibrium. One can enlarge the concept of the influence\nof background cosmology by dropping the equilibrium condition and go over to a fully\ndynamical scenario. A first step in this direction was done on section 4. Supplementing\nthese equation with Euler equation for the angular velocity, one has a full set of\ndifferential equations determining the time evolution of the parameters during (and\nafter) virialization. We will come back to this point in future publications.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\n[10]\n\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n\nEinstein, A.
