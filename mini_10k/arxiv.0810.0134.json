Recent observations in the TeV band challenge the simplest models developed to describe the overall emission of\nblazars and radiogalaxies. In particular, the observation of variable TeV emission from M87 and the fast variability shown by\nPKS 2155-304 challenge the standard framework. We discuss how the existence of a radial structure in the sub-pc scale jet,\nwith faster a component (\"spine\" or \"needles\") embedded in a slower layer can explain the basic phenomenology of these\nsources.\nKeywords: gamma-rays: theory \u2013 galaxies: active\nPACS: 95.30.Jx, 95.85.Pw, 98.54.Cm\n\nINTRODUCTION: THE STRUCTURED\nJET MODEL\nSeveral observational and theoretical clues suggest that\njets in extragalactic sources can be structured, with a fast\ncore (spine) surrounded by a slower layer. Among the\nevidences coming from observations we recall the direct\nradio imaging of structures in the innermost regions of\nthe close-by BL Lac objects and radiogalaxies [1,2,3]\nand the two-velocity structure required to unify FRI radiogalaxies and BL Lacs [4]. Theoretically, a structure\nin the jet alleviates some problems related to the models\nof TeV BL Lacs [5]. Recent simulations of jet formation\nsupport the existence of a spine\u2013layer structure already\nin the initial phases of the jet propagation [6,7].\nThe existence of a velocity structure has a strong impact on the observed emission properties of jets. Specifically, the radiatively interplay between the layer and the\nspine amplifies the inverse Compton emission of both\ncomponents [8,9]. Indeed, both components will see the\nemission of the other amplified because of the relative\nspeed. This \"external\" radiation contributes to the total\nenergy density, enhancing the emitted inverse Compton\nradiation. Depending on the parameters, this \"external\nCompton\" (EC) emission can dominate over the internal\nsynchrotron self-Compton (SSC) component that, especially in TeV blazars, is depressed because scatterings\nmainly occur in the Klein-Nishina regime.\nAn important point to consider is that the emission\nfrom the layer is beamed within the angle \u03b8l \u223c 1/\u0393l\n(where \u0393l is the bulk Lorentz factor of the layer), larger\nthan the corresponding angle for the spine, since \u0393s > \u0393l .\nThis implies that the layer can be seen at relatively large\nviewing angles for which, instead, the emission from the\nspine is severely depressed. A direct prediction of this\nfact is that, besides blazars (dominated by the spine),\n\nalso misaligned jets in radiogalaxies could be relatively\nstrong \u03b3 -ray emitters, dominated by the layer [5].\nIn the following we use the spine-layer scenario to\ninterpret the observed TeV emission from M87 and the\nchallenging rapid variability (down to few minutes) recently observed from some TeV blazars.\n\nTEV EMISSION OF M87\nThe nearby (16 Mpc) radiogalaxy M87 has been discovered as a TeV source by the HEGRA array [9]. Subsequent observations by H.E.S.S., VERITAS and MAGIC\nconfirmed the emission and showed that the TeV flux\nis variable, both on short (\u223c2 days) and long (years)\ntimescales [10,11,12]. Though the limited spatial resolution of Cherenkov telescopes prevents to localize the\nemission region, the short variability timescale allows\nus to rule-out models predicting TeV emission from the\nkpc-scale jet [13].\nAmong the possible scenarios advanced to explain the\nobserved emission, that considering the emission from\nthe peculiar knot HST-1, located at 60 pc (projected)\nfrom the core [14,15] was supported by the apparent correlation of the measured TeV flux and the X-ray emission\nof HST-1 as measured by the monitoring of Chandra. Xray measures are difficult, since the separation of the core\nand HST-1 is at the limit of the capabilities of Chandra.\nRecent observations, showing an increase of the TeV flux\nnot accompanied by a corresponding increase of the Xray brightness of HST-1 [11] though not completely ruling out the connection between TeV emission and HST1, open the possibility that the VHE emission originates\nin the core. Moreover, the short variability timescales\nseem difficult to reconcile with the size of HST-1 without\ninvoking some special geometry at the shock [15,16].\n\n\fFIGURE 1. Left: SED of the core of M87 (open squares) together with the H.E.S.S. spectra taken in 2004 (open squares) and\n2005 (open triangles), from [10]. The lower bow\u2013tie reports the X\u2013ray spectrum as measured by Chandra in 2000. We reproduced\nthe increased X\u2013ray emission of 2004 and 2005 (higher bow-ties) assuming the same slope and a larger normalisation. The lines\nreport the emission from the spine and from the layer for the two states (dashed: 2004; solid: 2005). For comparison, the thick\nline indicates the sensitivity of Fermi (5\u03c3 , 1 year, converted in luminosity assuming the distance of M87). Right: The upper line\nreports the spine emission computed for a viewing angle of 6 deg, compared with data obtained for BL Lac (filled symbols). The\ncorresponding emission from the layer is well below that of the spine and is not reported for simplicity. From [20].\n\nModels in which the emission region is located close\nto the core do not have problems in explaining the short\ntimescale variability. Neronov & Aharonian [17] proposed that the TeV emission comes from relativistic particles accelerated by magnetic fields close the central supermassive black hole. A more direct possibility is that\nthe emission comes from the slightly misaligned (\u03b8 \u2243 20\ndeg) inner jet [18]. However, it can be shown that a simple homogeneous synchrotron-SSC model fails in reproducing the entire spectral energy distribution of the core\nof M87, mainly because of the large separation of the\nsynchrotron and SSC peaks in the SED [19,20], requiring unreasonably large Doppler factors (\u03b4 \u223c 500).\nThe spine-layer scenario can easily overcome this\nproblem [20]. In our model (Fig.1) the emission from the\nspine (with bulk Lorentz factor \u0393s = 12) accounts for the\nlow-energy emission, from radio to the GeV band, while\nthe VHE component is produced by the layer (with bulk\nLorentz factor \u0393l = 4). To produce TeV photons we have\nto assume that electrons in the layer are highly relativistic\nand thus the corresponding synchrotron radiation peaks\nat relatively high frequency, above the X-ray band, where\nthe SSC radiation of the spine dominates. The SSC emis-\n\nsion in the layer occurs mainly in the KN regime and\nthus is strongly suppressed. The high-energy peak of the\nlayer is thus largely dominated by the EC component.\nThe model clearly predicts that during states of high Xray flux M87 should be a bright source at GeV energies,\na prediction that Fermi should easily test.\nAn important constrain that such a model has to satisfy\nis that the SED seen by an observer located at small angle\nshould display a shape similar to that of known blazars.\nFor comparison, in Fig.1 the filled symbols report the observational data for the prototype of BL Lac objects, BL\nLac itself. The upper solid line is the SED of M87 measured by an observer locate at 6 deg with respect to the jet\naxis. At small angles the jet is dominated by the beamed\nemission of the spine, while the less amplified layer component provides a negligible contribution. Though we do\nnot intend to exactly reproduce the SED of this particular\nblazar, one can see that the model follows quite well the\nobserved data.\nA direct prediction of the structured jet model is that\nFermi (and possibly Cherenkov telescopes) should detect\nother radiogalaxies, probably those with the (inner) jet\nonly slightly misaligned with respect to the line of sight.\n\n\fFIGURE 2. The SED of PKS 2155-304. Observed TeV data from HESS correspond to the flare of 2006 July 28 [22]. Red points\nreport the TeV spectrum corrected for the extragalactic absorption (see text for details). X-ray and optical data are not strictly\nsimultaneous to the TeV ones, but corresponds to 2 and 4 d later. Other symbols are archival data. The dashed line corresponds\nto the flux produced by the needle if we neglect the radiation energy density produced by the rest of the jet. The radiation energy\ndensity seen by the jet due to the needle emission is assumed to be negligible. From [27].\n\nOther possibilities to produce detectable fluxes of \u03b3 -rays\nfrom radiogalaxies, not critically dependent on the viewing angle, include the emission of the kpc scale jet [13],\nof the hotspots [21] or of the lobes. The most direct way\nto distinguish the origin of the high-energy emission is\nthrough the variability. Fast (\u223cdays) variability would directly exclude possibilities involving large scale regions,\nindicating that the emission originates in the most compact regions of the radiogalaxy (jet or BH).\n\nRAPID TEV VARIABILITY OF PKS\n2155-304\nIn summer 2006 the TeV BL Lac PKS 2155-304 showed\na period of extreme variability in the TeV band [22]. During the night of July 28 well resolved flares varying on\ntimescales of 200 seconds were observed (similar variations have been also observed in Mkn 501, [23]). In\nthis phase the source was very active at VHE, reaching observed luminosities of 1047 erg/s (to be compared\nwith more typical luminosities of \u223c 1045 erg/s). Such\nshort variability timescales are difficult to explain in the\nstandard framework [24]. Indeed, in the widely assumed\ninternal shock scenario variations should last for times\n\nlarger than the timescale associated to the black hole,\ntvar > Rs /c \u223c 1.4M9 h, where Rs is the Schwarzschild radius of the BH. On the other hand, if the source is a moving sphere, Doppler factor as large as \u03b4 = 50 \u2212 100 are\nrequired in order to keep the compactness of the source\nto acceptable values [25,26].\nAlso in this case a structured jet offers a good way to\nreproduce these states [27] without a radical change of\nthe theoretical framework (Fig.2). In this version the role\nof the spine is played by a \"needle\", a very compact (size\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 1014 cm) region inside the ten times bigger \"normal\" jet, responsible for the emission observed during\nmost of the time. Though the needle is characterized by a\nhigh bulk Lorentz factor, \u0393 = 50, the total power needed\nto reproduce the observed emission does not exceed that\ncarried by the normal jet.\nAs in the model for M87, a crucial role is played by\nthe radiative interplay between the needle and the normal\njet. As can be seen in Fig.2, the bulk of the IC emission\nfrom the needle is produced through the scattering of\nthe photons emitted by the jet, whose energy density\nis amplified by the high relative speed. Note that the\ncontribution of the needle at other frequencies is minor,\nconsistently with the small variability observed during\nthe active phases, especially at X-ray frequencies (e.g.\nCostamante, these proceedings). Such a scenario could\n\n\fthus easily explain the so-called \"orphan flares\", TeV\nflares without a counterpart in the X-ray band [28]. This\nalso offers an effective way to test our scenario through\nmultifrequency observations, especially in the crucial Xray and UV bands. If ultrafast variations on the TeV\nband are not accompanied by corresponding variations at\nlower frequencies, then the \"needle-jet\" model (or, more\ngenerally, any model considering more than an emission\nregion) is preferred.\nA consequence of the \"needle-jet\" model is that the\npower of the jet is dominated by the electrons (and protons) carried by the \"normal\" flow, while the magnetic\nfield provides a negligible role (contrary the conclusions\nof [24]).\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe tkank Laura Maraschi for useful comments\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nGiroletti, M., et al. 2004, ApJ, 600, 127\nGiroletti, M. et al. 2008, A&A, 488, 905\nKovalev, Y.Y. et al. 2007, ApJ, 668, L27\nChiaberge, M., Celotti, A., Capetti, A., & Ghisellini, G.\n2000, A&A, 358, 104\n5.
