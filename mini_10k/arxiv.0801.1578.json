Although recent theoretical models require\nthe presence of and the accretion from a circumstellar disc (Bonnell et al. 2001; Yorke & Sonnhalter 2002;\nKrumholz, Klein & McKee 2007), the direct observation of\nsuch a configuration is still missing.\nDuring a systematic infrared study of the young star\ncluster NGC 6618 inside the H ii region M 17 (Omega Nebula), Chini et al. (2004) discovered an opaque silhouette,\nshaped like a flared disc at JHK with a diameter of\n\u223c20 000 AU against the bright background of the H ii region. It is associated with an optically visible hourglassshaped nebula perpendicular to the silhouette plane. The\n\u22c6\n\nBased on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile., project nos. 73.C-0170, 73.C-0183 and 75.C0852.\n\u2020 E-mail: nielbock@mpia.de\n\noptical spectrum of the nebula exhibits emission lines with\nblue-shifted absorption features indicating disc accretion.\nSteinacker et al. (2006) successfully modelled the optical depth and the photon scattering of the silhouette at\n2.2 \u03bcm and obtained a large circumstellar disc seen at an\ninclination angle of 12\u25e6 (almost edge-on). They found disc\nmasses between 0.02 and 5 M\u2299 depending on the assumed\ndust model and the distance. The mass range is in good\nagreement with the distance-scaled values by Sako et al.\n(2005) derived from their NIR (near infrared) extinction\nmap. The distance has recently been determined to 2.1 \u00b1\n0.2 kpc on the basis of about 50 spectroscopically classified\nearly-type stars (Hoffmeister et al. 2008) ruling out earlier\nestimates below 2 kpc that treated several unresolved highmass binaries as single stars. The new spectro-photometric\ndistance agrees well with previous studies based on multicolour photometry (2.2 \u00b1 0.2 kpc; Chini, Els\u00e4sser & Neckel\n1980) and radio data (2.4\u00b10.4\n0.5 kpc; Russeil 2003).\nIndependent of its mass, the M 17 silhouette is the\n\n\f2\n\nM. Nielbock et al.\n\nlargest disc found to date that is exhibiting accretion activity. In fact, N\u00fcrnberger et al. (2007) discovered a H2 jet\nemerging from the disc centre, also suggesting ongoing accretion.\nAt the disc centre, Chini et al. (2004) found an elliptical\nK band emission of 240 \u00d7 450 AU2 . Likewise, Sako et al.\n(2005) describe the central object as an elongated compact\ninfrared source. A faint emission of unknown nature is also\nvisible in their [Ne ii] narrow band MIR (mid infrared) image\nat 12.8 \u03bcm.\nAssuming that the central K band flux found by\nChini et al. (2004) originates from a single star at a distance\nof 2.1 kpc, the stellar mass may range between a few and\n45 M\u2299 , depending on the extinction model (Steinacker et al.\n2006). Sako et al. (2005) explained their results in terms of\nan intermediate-mass object with a stellar mass of 2.5 to\n8 M\u2299 . Their analysis was part of a larger survey of candidate silhouette objects in M 17 (Ito et al. 2008).\nSo far, both the mass and the temperature of the forming star within this spectacular disc remain under discussion.\nIn this work, we present new data that provide further insight into the nature of the central protostellar object and\nconstrain the possible mass range. We also discuss the detection of a possible counter-jet headed in the opposite direction of the H2 jet and a curved southwestern emission\nnebula that is geometrically symmetric to the northeastern\none.\n\n2\n\nTable 1.

Within the errors, the Ks PSF fit to the central point-source appeared circular. The surrounding fuzzy\nand somewhat scattered emission can be entirely attributed\nto the central ridge introducing a background pattern similar to what is visible in the H band. Due to the absence of\nsufficiently bright PSF model stars in the NACO J band,\nwe had to perform aperture photometry. An aperture correction was applied to all the measurements. The results of\nthe photometry are listed in Table 1.\nAstrometric calibration of all but the NACO data is\nbased on the 2MASS database. Since there are no 2MASS\nsources on the NACO frames, we used stars detected with\nISAAC (Chini et al. 2004) in the vicinity of the disc for astrometry. We estimate the accuracy to be better than 0.\u2032\u2032 1.\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTION\n\nThe narrow band imaging was done with SOFI (Finger et al.\n1998) at the ESO NTT on La Silla, Chile, in April 2004. The\n[Fe ii] line at \u03bb = 1.64 \u03bcm was probed with a narrow band filter centred on \u03bb = 1.644\u00b10.025 \u03bcm. In order to subtract the\ncontinuum from the spectral line data, we obtained images\nin an adjacent narrow band filter centred on \u03bb = 1.71 \u03bcm.\nThe seeing limited spatial resolution is 0.\u2032\u2032 9 (FWHM), the\npixel size is 0.\u2032\u2032 288.\nThe adaptive optics JHKsL\u2032 M \u2032 imaging was carried out in July and August 2005 with NAOS/CONICA\n(Rousset et al. 2003; Hartung et al. 2003) at the ESO VLT.\nWe used the CONICA S13 lens for the JHKs measurements providing a pixel resolution of 0.\u2032\u2032 013 and a field size\nof 14\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 14\u2032\u2032 . The L\u2032 M \u2032 imaging was done with the L27 lens\nresulting in a pixel size of 0.\u2032\u2032 027. While for the L\u2032 band the\ncorresponding FOV was 28\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 28\u2032\u2032 , M \u2032 band measurements\nonly use the central 512\u00d7512 pixels equivalent to a field size\nof 14\u2032\u2032 \u00d714\u2032\u2032 . The effective spatial resolution is 0.\u2032\u2032 1 (FWHM).\nThe photometric errors vary between 0.1 mag and 0.4 mag.\nThe Spitzer post-BCD data were taken from the\nGLIMPSE survey archive (Benjamin et al. 2003) based on\nan imaging campaign of the galactic plane using the IRAC\ncamera (Fazio et al. 2004) on board the Spitzer infrared\nsatellite (Werner et al. 2004).\nAll data were reduced and analysed with IRAF and\nMOPSI; the NACO H and Ks band images are shown in\nFig. 1. Among the NIR AO data, only the Ks band image shows a point-source; at J and H the emission is diffuse and extended. It was not detected at all in the L\u2032 M \u2032\nbands. Therefore, establishing a meaningful SED (spectral\nenergy distribution) for the embedded source is difficult. We\n\n3\n3.1\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe central point-source\n\nThe Ks band image in Fig. 1 for the first time resolves the\nelliptical infrared emission at the disc centre into a pointsource with a FWHM of 0.\u2032\u2032 1 (210 AU) and a tail that extends\nto the northeast. We regard the point-source as a single object, although close high-mass binaries can be separated by\n6 0.25 AU (Krumholz & Thompson 2007). The peak of the\ntail emission is separated by 0.\u2032\u2032 08 (170 AU) from the pointsource, defining a line that we interpret as the outflow axis\n(see Sect. 3.2). It appears tilted by \u223c 15\u25e6 from the disc symmetry axis. In the H band, we only detect diffuse emission\nwithout any indication for a point-source.\nThe symmetry of the source-jet-disc configuration is\nstriking. In particular the link between the source and the\njet seems obvious. The point-source bisects the line between\nthe peak emission of the northeastern nebula coinciding with\na weak H2 feature and the first strong maximum of the jet to\nthe southwest (Fig. 1, right panel). If chosen as the symmetry centre of the bipolar nebula, both wings match perfectly\nwhen rotated by 180\u25e6 (Fig. 1, left panel).\nAssuming the point-source emission stems from a reddened stellar photosphere at a distance of 2.1 kpc, we can\ncombine our photometry with the extinction estimate of\nSteinacker et al. (2006). They pursued the so far most sophisticated approach to model the spatial distribution of\nthe optical depth of the disc at 2.2 \u03bcm up to an outer radius of 10 000 AU including photon scattering effects. Their\nresult of \u03c42.2 \u03bcm = 2.6 (AV = 27) toward the disc centre\nis a lower limit, because (a) the unresolved inner disc at\n\n\fThe centre of the large circumstellar disc in M 17\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.

The dashed blue lines mark the suggested\njet axis as determined by the orientation of the detected tail with respect to the point-source.\n\nradii of 6 1000 AU were excluded from the model, and (b)\nthe model accounts for the optical depth of the disc alone\nwithout the influence of interstellar and intra-cluster foreground extinction. The latter contributions are estimated by\nanalysing the NIR colours of stars in the vicinity of the disc\nderived from the previously published ISAAC JHK data\n(Chini et al. 2004). Typical extinction values off the disc\nplane are about AV = 35 \u00b1 5. As a result, the sum of\nthe foreground and disc extinction toward the disc centre\namounts to AV = 62 \u00b1 5. Ito et al. (2008) find an absolute\nupper limit of AV = 30, but this is probably biased by their\ndetection limit. It contradicts previous estimates giving extinction values of AV > 40 for individual stars in this area\n(Chini & Wargau 1998; Jiang et al. 2002; Hoffmeister et al.\n2006).\nWe also estimated the extinction towards the disc centre\nindependently by creating an extinction map employing the\nmethod described by Siebenmorgen & Kr\u00fcgel (2000). It is\nbased on a differential photometry of the attenuating material (the disc) and a uniform background radiation (the H ii\nregion). Considering a uniform foreground extinction across\nthe extent of the disc, the measured optical depth is purely\ndue to the material inside the disc, because other contributions along the line of sight like interstellar and intra-cluster\nextinction or emission cancel out. Using Spitzer/GLIMPSE\narchival data at 3.6 and 4.5 \u03bcm, we determined the spatial\ndistribution of the optical depth by analysing the attenuation of the background emission originating from the ionised\n\ngas. This approach is comparable to the NIR extinction\nmaps of Sako et al. (2005) and Ito et al. (2008), but it has\nthe advantage of being less susceptible to scattering effects\nbecause of the larger wavelengths covered by the Spitzer\ndata. The optical depth estimates were converted to visual\nextinction values (Flaherty et al. 2007; Rom\u00e1n-Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al.\n2007; Nielbock, Chini & M\u00fcller 2003). In the resulting maps\n(Fig. 2), the extinction maximum is offset by \u223c 3\u2032\u2032 (6300 AU)\nsoutheast from the central point-source. Along the line of\nsight toward the disc centre, we obtain a total extinction\nsolely caused by the disc material of AV = 60 \u00b1 10, half\nof which is expected to be the disc extinction toward the\ncentre. The true peak extinction is probably even higher\nbecause of the spatial averaging resulting from the limited\nresolution of the Spitzer data. This leads to a blending of\nextinction and emission features resulting in a lower limit\nestimate of the extinction. Ito et al. (2008) find similar displacements between the extinction maximum of candidate\nsilhouette objects and the suggested embedded YSO, which\nthey attribute either to a migration of the YSO or its offcentred formation. However, it is still possible that those\nidentified silhouette structures are not necessarily related to\nthe nearby YSOs. After adding the foreground extinction,\nour results from the Spitzer extinction maps are consistent\nwith the estimate based on the NIR modelling.\nUsing the estimate of AV \u223c 60 mag as a lower limit\nto the extinction, the apparent Ks magnitude of the pointsource is equivalent to an absolute magnitude of a star hav-\n\n\f4\n\nM. Nielbock et al.\n\nFigure 2. Visual extinction maps of the central 30\u2032\u2032 \u00d7\n30\u2032\u2032 of the disc determined by applying the method of\nSiebenmorgen & Kr\u00fcgel (2000) to Spitzer/IRAC data. The position of the central point-source is marked with a white cross.\nThe scale is given in AV . The extinction maximum is located\n\u223c 3\u2032\u2032 southeast of the disc centre.\n\ning a spectral type of at least B8. In the case of a mainsequence star, this would correspond to a stellar mass of\n\u223c 2.8 M\u2299 (Blum, Conti & Damineli 2000). Although the\nreconstructed SINFONI H2 line image possesses a peak\nat the disc centre, the contribution of the H2 emission to\nthe continuum flux is negligible. The continuum flux measured in the NACO Ks filter (\u2206\u03bb = 0.35 \u03bcm) amounts to\n2.9 \u00d7 10\u221218 W m\u22122 ; the H2 1 \u2212 0 S(1) and H2 2 \u2212 1 S(1) lines\nthat have been measured with SINFONI contain a continuum corrected line flux of 2 \u2212 8 \u00d7 10\u221220 W m\u22122 . Thus, they\ncontribute only 1\u22123% to the continuum flux in the Ks filter.\nHowever, we cannot rule out any additional contamination\nby excess emission of spatially unresolved circumstellar material or accretion signatures close to the protostar.\nSako et al. (2005) present an image of this object obtained in the MIR using a narrow-band filter centred on the\n[Ne ii] line at 12.8 \u03bcm. Although a faint elongated emission\nis detected at the disc centre, it does not contribute much\nto resolving the open question of the nature of the central\nstar. Since emission from this line is commonly observed for\ncircumstellar discs (e. g. Pascucci et al. 2007), it is not clear,\nhow much of the detection is caused by continuum emission.\nA strict upper mass limit is difficult to determine from\nthe available data. Sako et al. (2005) argued that the missing radio continuum in the interferometric radio map of\nFelli, Massi & Churchwell (1984) establishes an upper mass\nlimit of 8 M\u2299 . However, this statement might not be valid,\nbecause the source is located in projection onto an ionisation front exhibiting large scale free-free emission that could\ncause confusion with any weak compact H ii source like an\nearly-type star in the lower mass range. Furthermore, a very\nyoung and just developing ionised gas sphere (e. g. a hypercompact H ii region) would be too small and too weak to be\ndetected by its free-free emission (Kurtz 2005).\nIn order to address this question, we analysed the NIR\ncolours derived from the values and upper limits given\nin Tab. 1. Assuming the Ks \u2212 M colour is entirely due\nto a reddened photosphere, the measured upper limit of\nKs \u2212 M 6 6.7 can be used to set an upper limit on the\nmass of the protostar. Fig. 3 displays the parameter space\nof Ks \u2212 M colours for given combinations of the visual extinction and the effective temperature of a main-sequence\nstar. The colours were derived from Ducati et al. (2001), and\nthe temperatures are assigned to spectral types and stellar\n\nmasses according to Blum et al. (2000). The loci of a reddened main-sequence star with an apparent magnitude of\nKs = 19.28 is indicated by crosses, interpolated by a solid\nline. This diagram yields the following two results: First, for\nthe previously determined lower extinction limit of AV = 60\nthe Ks \u2212 M colour attained by extinction alone amounts to\n4.9. Hence, any additional NIR colour excess must be less\nthan Ks \u2212 M = 1.8. Second, the measured Ks \u2212 M colour\ndetermines the upper extinction limit to AV 6 81.7. This\nconstrains also the effective temperature to Teff 6 22500 K\nwhich is equivalent to a spectral type just above B1, being\nin the mass range of about 8 M\u2299 for a main-sequence star\n(Blum et al. 2000). In this way, we corroborate the upper\nmass limit given by Sako et al. (2005). At this point, we\nwant to emphasise that not only the colours but also the\nphotometry and upper limits in Tab. 1 are consistent with\nthese estimates.\n\n3.2\n\nThe jet emission\n\nThe collimated H2 jet detected by N\u00fcrnberger et al. (2007)\noriginates at the disc centre and extends as far as 3.\u2032\u2032 6\nto the southwest. The SINFONI data suggest a blueshifted motion. Correcting for the disc inclination of 12\u25e6\n(Steinacker et al. 2006), a protostellar jet with a typical velocity of 100 km s\u22121 (Reipurth & Bally 2001) would reach\nthe current terminus within 365 years. The expected northeastern counter-jet was not detected by N\u00fcrnberger et al.\n(2007).\nThe NACO Ks image (Fig. 1, right panel) gives a first\nhint for the existence of such a feature, because the position\nangle between the point source and the jet-like feature extending to the northeast agrees with the direction of the H2\njet. This alignment indicates that we either see the origin\nof the counter-jet or at least circumstellar matter entrained\nand heated by its interaction. The northeastern extension of\nthe central H2 detection by SINFONI that coincides with the\njet-like feature may be an indication for residual jet emission. Therefore, we suggest that the counter-jet might exist,\nbut it is strongly extinguished by the circumstellar material.\nThis agrees with the picture suggested by Steinacker et al.\n(2006) that the near side of the disc is inclined to the northeast and partly covers the latitudes above the disc plane.\nOn the other hand, this jet may fail to produce detectable\nshocks due to a lack of dense material that has been cleared\nby the wind and radiation of the cluster OB stars that are\nmostly located on the northeastern side of the disc.\n\n3.3\n\nThe bipolar nebula\n\nThe accretion disk is associated with a bipolar hourglass\nshaped structure (Chini et al. 2004). The northeastern cavity hosts an emission nebula that resembles the working\nsurface of protostellar jets as seen in other outflows like\nHH 47 (Heathcote et al. 1996; Hartigan et al. 2005). Our\nnew NACO H band image shows a similar, but fainter\nfeature inside the southwestern cavity. In the left panel of\nFig. 1, we have superimposed the contours of the northeastern emission onto the southwestern nebula and vice versa\nafter rotating them by 180\u25e6 . Besides a similar morphology,\nthere is a symmetry of the peak emission with respect to\n\n\fThe centre of the large circumstellar disc in M 17\n95\n90\nKs \u2212 M = 7.0\n\n85\n\n75\n\nAV [mag]\n\nKs \u2212 M = 6.7\n\nB1V\n\n80\n\nKs \u2212 M = 6.0\n\nB2V\n\n70\n\nB3V\nB5V\n\n65\nB7V\n\nKs \u2212 M = 5.0\n\n60\nB9V\n\n55\nPSfrag replacements\n\nKs \u2212 M = 4.0\n\n50\n45\n40\n\nKs \u2212 M = 3.0\n\n5\n\nAnother more likely explanation is that the nebulae are\nscattered light reddened by extinction from the disc material. The spectroscopic accretion signatures (Chini et al.\n2004) imply that most of the scattered photons originate\nfrom the disc centre. Stark et al. (2006) present Monte\nCarlo radiative transfer models of circumstellar discs around\nyoung stellar objects. They show that NIR colours of the disc\ncentres affected by light scattering and extinction strongly\ndepend on the infall rate, the inclination angle, and the\ncavity opening angle of the disc. Their models cover infall rates up to 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 producing exceptionally blue\ncolours of H \u2212 K = 0.6 for nearly edge-on discs. Assuming that the accretion rate of the large M 17 disc of about\n10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (N\u00fcrnberger et al. 2007) is of the same order as the envelope infall rate, we would expect even bluer\ncolours which is at least qualitatively consistent with our\nresult of H \u2212 Ks = 0.12.\n\n35\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\n30000\n\nTeff [K]\n\nFigure 3. Analysis of infrared colours Ks \u2212 M for combinations\nof effective temperatures of stellar photospheres and visual extinctions. The colours are taken from Ducati et al. (2001). The\nmeasured upper limit of Ks \u2212 M 6 6.7 is plotted as a solid line\nresulting in an upper extinction limit of AV 6 81.7. The lower extinction limit of AV > 60 is denoted by the white box. The crosses\n\u2013 interpolated by a solid line \u2013 demonstrate the valid range for\na reddened main-sequence star of Ks = 19.28 at a distance of\n2.1 kpc, neglecting excess emission. The temperatures and spectral types are taken from Blum et al. (2000). The resulting valid\nrange determined by Teff = 11300 . . . 22500 K is highlighted by\nthe white box.\n\nthe central point-source. Both nebulae have a projected distance of 1500 AU from the central object and their origins\nare located along an axis that matches the position angle of\nthe star/jet system.\nUsing its full size at half maximum in the H band, the\nnortheastern nebula covers an opening angle of \u223c 70\u25e6 with\nrespect to the central point-source; it has a projected length\nof 2500 AU (1.\u2032\u2032 2) and a projected breadth of 840 AU (0.\u2032\u2032 4).\nIn the same area, the NACO data attain J = 17.59 mag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032 ,\nH = 16.68 mag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032 and Ks = 16.80 mag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032 with the brightness peaking along the assumed jet direction. We find an\nH band excess of > 1.2 mag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032 to what would be expected\nfor the thermal emission of a black body derived from the\nJHK data. This can be explained either by a combination\nof scattering and extinction or by line emission.\nRadiation from singly ionised iron \u2013 together with\nH2 \u2013 is the main coolant of shocked gas in the NIR\n(Caratti o Garatti et al. 2006). [Fe ii] lines are commonly\nobserved in J shocks, where the H2 is completely dissociated (Hollenbach & McKee 1989; Kumar et al. 2003).\nTherefore, it is a good candidate for contaminating the\nH band continuum flux. However, apart from a spurious\ndetection of [Fe ii] emission ahead of the northeastern nebula, in our NTT/SOFI narrow band data (not shown) it is\nstrongly concentrated towards the disc centre. This seems\nto be a typical phenomenon for many protostellar jets (Itoh\n2001; Davis et al. 2006). Therefore, the origin of the strong\nH band emission is probably not caused by [Fe ii].\n\n3.4\n\nH2 emission at the disc surface\n\nIn the right panel of Fig. 1, we have superimposed contours\nof the SINFONI data of N\u00fcrnberger et al. (2007) to compare the highly resolved H2 1 \u2212 0 S(1) emission with the\nKs continuum. Apart from the prominent emission from the\ndisc centre and the southwestern jet, there is also molecular hydrogen emission at the position of the northwestern\ndisc lane and \u2013 although much weaker \u2013 at the northeastern nebula. As the H2 emission in the disc seems to peak\nat its surface, an external excitation process like UV pumping might be in action. Indeed, PDRs (photo-dissociation\nregions) are known to possess a fair amount of molecular hydrogen just below its surface that can be excited\nby FUV (far ultraviolet, 6 eV < h\u03bd < 13.6 eV) radiation\n(Tielens & Hollenbach 1985). The existence of such a PDR\nis also supported by the detection of emission in the Spitzer\n8.0 \u03bcm band that includes PAH bands (polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon molecules).\nTwo possible sources for the exciting UV photons have\nto be considered: (a) the surrounding cluster stars, and (b)\nthe embedded star in the disc centre itself. If excited by\nthe surrounding cluster stars, one would expect the entire\ndisc surface to be a PDR that would be detected by H2\nline emission. However, because the size of the PDR is not\nonly a function of the temperature but also of the density\ndistribution inside the disc, an isotropic UV radiation field\ndoes not necessarily result in a uniform PDR. The major\nemission occurs at the northeastern side of the disc facing\nthe hottest cluster stars. If the PDR is due to the embedded\ncentral object, a detailed analysis of the excitation process\nin the disc could help to further constrain the nature of the\nforming star.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWith the new observations, we have further clarified the\nnature of the emission in the centre of the large M 17 disc\nand its associated nebula in the following aspects:\n(i) The faint central elliptical emission is resolved for the\nfirst time into a point-source and a tail that extends to the\nnortheast. This morphology suggests a single protostar accompanied by a jet.\n\n\f6\n\nM. Nielbock et al.\n\n(ii) The jet-like feature is headed in the opposite direction\nof a collimated H2 jet.\n(iii) A southwestern emission nebula is turning the outflow pattern from the disc centre into a fairly symmetric\nmorphology. The intensity ratio of the bipolar emission,\nhowever, is highly asymmetric, probably due to the inclination of the dusty disc.\n(iv) The bipolar nebula might be scattered light which is\nreddened by extinction caused by the disc material.\n(v) Various estimates of the extinction towards the embedded protostar yields a range of 60 6 AV 6 82.\n(vi) The observed 2.2 \u03bcm flux is equivalent to a protostar\nwith a mass range of 2.8 M\u2299 6 M\u22c6 6 8 M\u2299 .\nThe new data strengthen the evidence for an intermediate to high-mass protostellar object being formed by accretion.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank the VLT team for performing the JHKsL\u2032 M \u2032 observations in service mode.
