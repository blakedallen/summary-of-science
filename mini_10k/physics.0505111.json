Schematics of the fiber geometry and the imaginary closed surface S = S1 + S2 ,\nwhere S1 is a circle parallel and close to the end-facet and S2 is a semi-sphere concentric\nwith S1 .\n\nThe photonic crystal fiber [1, 2] (PCF) offers a unique opportunity for realizing broadband\nlarge-mode area (LMA) single-mode (SM) fibers [3]. In high-power laser applications the LMA\nproperty is desirable to keep the power density below the damage threshold of silica as well as\nto avoid non-linear phenomena and the SM property is essential for the beam quality and the\nability to generate close to diffraction-limited beams. Recent studies of LMA-SM-PCF lasers\nhave suggested that the PCF technology may indeed offer good beam quality [4] as quantified\nby an M-squared value [5] close to unity (M 2 = 1 for a Gaussian beam).\nFor the fundamental mode in PCFs the near and far fields have intensity distributions which\nare overall close to Gaussian, but with a six-fold rotational symmetry reflecting the symmetry\nof the air-hole lattice. For LMA-PCFs there are no significant deviations from a Gaussian distribution for intensities above the 1/e2 level [6] and for many practical applications the mode\nmay be considered Gaussian. However, as studied recently the derivation from a Gaussian distribution has some important consequences [7]. In the near-field the intensity is suppressed at\nthe locations of the air-holes and in the asymptotic far-field these suppressions manifest themselves as low-intensity satellite peaks. Furthermore, in the near field to far-field transition the\nintensity becomes strongly focused at a finite distance from the end-facet as can be understood\nby a simple Gaussian decomposition of the near field.\nWhile the simple decomposition approach has proved very useful for the qualitative understanding of the near to far-field transition the laser applications call for a more quantitative study\nof the radiated field. Calculating the diffraction pattern is generally a complicated task, which\ninvolves the full solution to the elastic scattering problem at the end-facet. Here, we rigorously\ncalculate radiated fields from the end-facet utilizing a surface equivalence principle [8].\nThe calculations of the modal reflectivity from the fiber end-facet is performed with a threedimensional frequency domain modal method relying on Fourier expansion technique [9, 10].\nIn brief, the Fourier expansion method relies on an analytical integration of Maxwells equations\nalong one direction (the fiber axis) and on a supercell approach in the other two transversal directions. We emphasize that for the radiated field at the surface S1 we have treated the elastic\nscattering at the end-facet fully, i.e. the incident fundamental mode is partly reflected (no mode\nmixing for symmetry reasons) and partly radiated/transmitted. Through the surface equivalence\nprinciple, any wave-front can be considered as a source of secondary waves which add to produce distant wave-fronts according to Huygens principle.\nIn order to apply the surface equivalence principle, we surround the end-facet radiating fiber\nwith an imaginary closed surface S = S1 + S2 , where S1 is a circle parallel and close to the\nend-facet and S2 is a semi-sphere concentric with S1 , see Fig. 1. Both of these surfaces are of\ninfinite extent. By considering proper surface currents on S which are equivalent in the sense\n\n\fthat they yield the same field outside S, we can formally erase all the existing elements inside\nS and fill it with a perfect electric conducting (PEC) body. The equivalent surface electrical\nand magnetic currents on S are Je (r) = n\u0302 \u00d7 H and Me (r) = \u2212n\u0302 \u00d7 E, respectively, where n\u0302 is an\noutward normal to the surface S [8]. Of course, these currents radiate in the presence of the PEC\nand not in unbounded free-space. Because of the infinite radius of S2 , electromagnetic fields on\nthis surface take zero value. On S1 electromagnetic fields are determined from near-fields. Since\nthe S1 surface is an infinitely extended flat PEC body we can utilize image theory to replace\nthe conductor by image currents \u2212Je and Me . Ultimately, computation of radiated fields of\nan open-ended PCF is simplified to computing radiated fields of the fictitious current source\nM(r) = 2Me (r) = \u22122n\u0302 \u00d7 E in free-space. Calculating radiated fields of the current source can\nbe achieved systematically through electric \u03c0e (r) and magnetic \u03c0m (r) Hertz vector potentials\ndefined by:\n\u2032\n\n\u03c0e (r) =\n\n\u2212j\n4\u03c0\u03c9\u03b50\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0m (r) =\n\n\u2212j\n4\u03c0\u03c9 \u03bc0\n\nZ\n\nJ(r\u2032 )\nS\n\nS\n\ne\u2212 jk|r\u2212r | \u2032\ndS ,\n| r \u2212 r\u2032 |\n\n(1a)\n\n\u2032\n\nM(r\u2032 )\n\ne\u2212 jk|r\u2212r | \u2032\ndS .\n| r \u2212 r\u2032 |\n\n(1b)\n\nEmploying these potentials, electric and magnetic fields are obtained by:\nE(r) = (k2 + \u22072 )\u03c0e (r) \u2212 j\u03c9 \u03bc0 \u2207 \u00d7 \u03c0m (r),\n\n(2a)\n\nH(r) = j\u03c9\u03b50 \u2207 \u00d7 \u03c0e(r) + (k + \u2207 )\u03c0m (r),\n\n(2b)\n\n2\n\n2\n\nwhere \u03c9 = ck, k = 2\u03c0 /\u03bb , and \u03bb is the free-space wavelength. From Eqs. (2a) and (2b) we\nexpect an improvement in computational time by a factor of roughly two compared to a direct\nuse of the surface equivalence principle [11] in which both fictitious electric and magnetic\nsurface currents exist.\nWe employ the described approach in a fully vectorial study of the evolution of the fundamental mode of a PCF from near-field to far-field. As an example we consider the fundamental\nmode in a pure-silica PCF with a normalized air-hole diameter d/\u039b = 0.45 and in our simulations we utilize the scale-invariance of Maxwell's equations for a frequency-independent\ndielectric function. Recent experimental studies showed quite complicated interference phenomena in the near to far-field transition [7] and in particular a focusing behavior was observed\nat a finite distance from the end-facet. As illustrated in Fig. 2 this focusing phenomena is born\nout by our numerical simulation where the peak intensity of the radiation increases up to short\ndistances from the fiber end-facet. The electric field intensity is maximal at a distance z0 which\nis typically in the range \u039b . z0 . 10 \u00d7 \u039b. At this particular distance the intensity pattern is\nrotated by an angle of \u03c0 /6 compared to the near-field, in full agreement with the experimental observations. As the wavelength is increased relative to the pitch the diffraction by the six\ninner-most air holes increases and z0 shifts closer to the end facet of the PCF. We emphasize\nthat this interference phenomenon has no counterparts for e.g. step-index fibers with cylindrical\nsymmetry; the focusing relies fully on the six-fold rotational symmetry of the air-hole lattice.\nIt should also be emphasized that the phase-front is non-trivial (non-constant) in the transverse\nplane at z0 and in that sense the focusing differs from that observed with a classical lens.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the electric field amplitude at various distances from the end-facet up to\nthe asymptotic far-field region. The nearly hexagonal shape of the fundamental mode of the\nfiber (Panel A) is transformed into a nearly circular shape (Panel B) which is followed by a\nhexagonal shape at z \u2243 z0 (Panel C) where the orientation is rotated by an angle of \u03c0 /6 with\nrespect to the fiber mode at z = 0. This hexagonal shape expands as it propagates (Panels D and\nE) and then becomes close to circular again above the 1/e amplitude level (Panel F). As the\n\n\fintensity (normalized)\n\n1.3\n1.1\n0.9\n\u03bb/\u039b=0.05\n\u03bb/\u039b=0.1\n\u03bb/\u039b=0.2\n\u03bb/\u039b=0.4\n\u03bb/\u039b=0.6\n\n0.7\n0.5\n0.3\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\nz/\u039b\n\nFig. 2. Variation of the electric field intensity with distance from the end-facet (z = 0) at\nthe center of fiber.\n\ndistance from the end-facet becomes larger, six satellites start emerging from the mode shape\nbelow the 1/e amplitude level (Panel G). Finally, for larger distances satellites appear clearly\n(Panel H).\nAs an alternative to the above rigorous approach, it is in fiber optics common to approximate\nthe far field by a Fourier transformation of the near field [12]. Here we shall derive this expression starting from the above formalism. In the far-field limit we approximate the r \u2212 r\u2032 in the\ndenominators of Eqs. (1a) and (1b) by r and in the exponential we correspondingly approximate\nit by r \u2212 r\u0302 * r\u2032 , where r\u0302 = r/r is the unit radial vector of the spherical coordinate. The magnetic\nHertz vector potential, Eq.
