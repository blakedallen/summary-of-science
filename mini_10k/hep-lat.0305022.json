Unfortunately euclidean Lattice Gauge Theory, our main non\nperturbative tool for QCD studies, has not been able to\nhelp us for two reasons: i) the difficulties in defining the\ntopological charge operator on the lattice [2] and ii) the\nimaginary contribution to the action that comes from the\n\u03b8-term prevents the applicability of the importance sampling method.\nConcerning the \u03b8-term effect on the low energy dynamics, two dimensional CPN \u22121 models are very interesting since they have \u03b8-vacua, a well defined topological charge and many features in common with fourdimensional Yang-Mills theories: they are asymptotically\nfree, possess instanton solutions, and admit a 1/N expansion. Of course they share point ii) with QCD and this\nmeans that, from the point of view of numerical calculations, the complex action problem is as severe as in QCD.\nUnfortunately the algorithms used in the past to tackle\nthe complex action problem are limited to moderate lattice sizes and the fate of CP symmetry at \u03b8 = \u03c0 is still\nan open question [3, 4].\nRecently we proposed two independent methods for\nsimulating models with \u03b8-term. Both are based on standard (i.e. with real action) simulations of the model at\nimaginary \u03b8 = \u2212ih but then they use completely different strategies. The first is based on the reconstruction of\nthe probability distribution function of the order parameter [5], the second introduces a particular transformation\nthat allows to reconstruct the order parameter via an extrapolation of a suitably chosen quantity [6]. Both can\nin principle suffer from systematics but the agreement\nof the two gives, a posteriori, a very stringent indication\nthat systematic effects are indeed under control.\nWe tested the two algorithms in some models where the\nanalytical solution is available, and also a perfect agreement between the two approaches was found for CP3 in\nthe strong coupling region. The aim of present work is\nto extend this study to the continuum limit.\n\nMoving to the weak coupling region is a tricky issue.\nCPN \u22121 models have the problem of unphysical configurations characterized by topological structures of the size of\none lattice spacing (called dislocations) [7, 8]. The effect\nis relevant for small N while, for N \u2192 \u221e, is suppressed\nand the model becomes a system of N free particles and\nN free antiparticles where \u03b8-vacua are degenerate in energy [9, 10]. If we are interested in the continuum limit\nthe effect of dislocations has to be negligible not to spoil\nthe scaling properties of the theory. For small N this\nforces to go to very large values of the correlation length\nand, consequently, untenable large volumes are mandatory.\nPrevious studies of CPN \u22121 models at \u03b8 = 0 reported\nthat N = 4 is not large enough to suppress dislocations\n[11]. Indications of scaling of the topological susceptibility \u03c7t (\u03b8 = 0) were observed but violations of universality\nwere also present: simulations with different actions lead\nto distinct asymptotic values [11, 12]. It is not the scope\nof present work to analyze the contribution of dislocations to the topological charge at finite \u03b8, and it is not\neasy to address this problem within our framework since\ndifferent definition of the charge operator (like the one\nbased on local polynomial definition or cooling) can not\nbe directly applicable to \u03b8 = \u2212ih simulations. What we\nknow is that increasing N the situation is less severe and\nindeed, using the results of Campostrini et al [11], we\ncan affirm that N = 10 is large enough. Therefore we\nconcentrated our efforts on the scaling region of the CP9\nmodel.\nWe have adopted for the action the \"auxiliary U(1)\nfield\" formulation\nSg = N \u03b2\n\nX\n\n(z\u0304n+\u03bc zn Un,\u03bc + z\u0304n zn+\u03bc \u016an,\u03bc \u2212 2)\n\n(1)\n\nn,\u03bc\n\nwhere zn is a N -component complex scalar field that satisfies z\u0304n zn = 1 and Un,\u03bc is a U (1) \"gauge field\". The\ntopological charge operator is defined directly from the\n\n\f2\nU (1) field:\nS\u03b8 = i\n\n\u03b8 X\nlog(Up )\n2\u03c0 p\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Up is the product of the U (1) field around the\nplaquette and \u2212\u03c0 < log(Up ) \u2264 \u03c0.\nFor both methods the action to simulate S = Sg +\nS\u03b8=\u2212ih is real and local. This implies that the main\ncomputational cost is practically equivalent to standard\nsimulations of CPN \u22121 model at \u03b8 = 0. This is important\nsince, as will be clear in the following, large volume simulations were mandatory to have good quality raw data.\nWe refer to the original papers for more information\nand summarize here the main points of the new methods.\nThe first one [5, 13] reconstructs the p.d.f. of the topological charge density that is introduced to define the finite volume partition function as a discrete sum over the\ndifferent topological sectors:\nX\nZV (\u03b8) =\ne\u2212V fV (x) ei\u03b8V x .\n(3)\nx\n\nwhere x = n/V is the density of topological charge (n is\nan integer that labels sectors with different topological\ncharge) and e\u2212V fV (x) is, up to a normalization constant,\nthe above mentioned p.d.f. . From the measurement of\nthe mean value of the density of topological charge as a\nfunction of h we use the saddle point approximation to\nget, up to O(1/V ) corrections, a numerical evaluation of\nfV\u2032 (x), the derivative of fV (x) respect to x. After a fit of\nsuch derivative, an analytical integration is performed to\nreconstruct the desired probability distribution function.\nAt the very end a multi-precision code is used to compute\nthe sum (3) and, consequently, all the relevant physical\nquantities.\nThe fitting procedure intrinsic in our approach avoids\nthe pathological flattening behavior of the free energy as\nalready noted by other groups [4]. It is also important\nto notice that the multi-precision step needed to compute the observables (free energy density and topological\ncharge density) from the definition (3) is not a bottleneck.\nAs reported elsewhere [13] it can be shown that, at large\nvolume, only the values of x such that fV (x) \u2264 gV (\u03c0)\n(where gV (\u03b8) is the exact free energy density normalized\nto zero at \u03b8 = 0) are relevant for the computation of the\nsum (3). This has some positive implications:\n(i) it is possible to fit only the relevant part of the data\nhaving very good fits with a suitably chosen function depending on few parameters;\n(ii) the number of terms relevant for the correct evaluation of the sum (3) is much smaller than V and diminishes\nincreasing \u03b2 (recall that gV (\u03b8) goes to zero as \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e);\n(iii) the number of significant digits necessary for the\ncalculation of (3) is related to the quantity e\u2212V gV (\u03c0) (the\nsmallest value the partition function takes) and, at fixed\nvolume, the required precision in the multi-precision step\n\ndiminishes when going deeper in the weak coupling region.\nTo take advantage of it we use an iterative procedure:\nfrom a first \"trial fit\" done with all the data available we\ncan have an estimation of fV (x) and, using the multiprecision code, an estimation of gV (\u03c0). Using this approximate information we can extract a trial value xmax\nsuch that gV (\u03c0) <\n\u223c fV (xmax ). Having a better determination of the interval actually necessary for current\nanalysis we can repeat the procedure steps. In practice\nthe convergence is very fast (two, maximum three steps\nare enough in all cases) and, at the end, allows to fit only\nthe relevant part of the data having very good fits.\nThe second method [6] uses x(h), the topological\ncharge density, in a different way. It is possible to\nrewrite the sum (3) as an even polynomial in the variable z = cosh h2 and to define the derivative of the free\nenergy density respect to log z 2 as y(z) = x(h)/ tanh h2 .\n\u03bb\nUsing the transformation y\u03bb (z) = y(e 2 z) and plotting\ny\u03bb /y against y one gets typically a smooth function for\nsmall y [6]. In addition, in the weak coupling scaling region, the function y\u03bb /y can be computed from numerical\nsimulations at real h until values of y very close to 0.\nHence we can expect a simple extrapolation to y \u2192 0\n(i.e. in the region corresponding to real \u03b8) to be reliable\nand thus to obtain x(\u03b8) (of course the result has to be\nindependent of the specific value of \u03bb).\nIn the same spirit the effective exponent \u03b3\u03bb =\n2\nlog(y\n\u03bb /y) as a function of y will give the dominant\n\u03bb\npower of y(z) as a function of z near z = 0 or, equivalently, the behavior of x(\u03b8) for \u03b8 \u2192 \u03c0. If \u03b3\u03bb (y \u2192 0) = 1\nCP symmetry is spontaneously broken at \u03b8 = \u03c0, values\nbetween 1 and 2 indicate a second order phase transition\nwith a divergent susceptibility and so on. Clearly the\nmethod is based on the feasibility of a simple extrapolation procedure. This can only be considered a working\nhypothesis but it has already been successfully tested in\ndifferent models [6].\nFor both approaches systematic effects can be present:\nO(1/V ) corrections to saddle point solution and the arbitrariness of the fitting function in the first case (see\nthe relative discussion in [5]), the reliability of extrapolation in the second one. What is crucial is that the\nconsistency of results coming from the two procedures is\na strong indication that systematic effects are negligible\nand we are actually reconstructing the true \u03b8 dependence\nof the model.\nFor N = 10 and h = 0 the scaling window starts at \u03b2\naround 0.75 (see [11]) and we decided to concentrate our\nefforts from this point on. The first step is to establish\nthe appropriate lattice sizes. From h = 0 simulations\nat fixed \u03b2 one realizes that the asymptotic value of the\ntopological susceptibility is reached when the lattice side\nL is roughly larger than 8 times the correlation lengths.\nUsing available data [11] we get L \u2265 40 for \u03b2 = 0.8,\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: The symbols are \u03b3\u03bb (y) in a L = 100, \u03b2 = 0.80 lattice\nfor \u03bb = 1.0. The continuous line is a quadratic fit to the data\n(reduced \u03c72 is 1.20).\n\nL \u2265 70 for \u03b2 = 0.9 and so on. Convergence of \u03c7t to the\ninfinite volume limit is even faster at imaginary \u03b8 and\nconsequently we expect the results at real \u03b8 extracted\nfrom h 6= 0 simulations will scale too.\nFor h > 0 simulations we considered different h values (\u2243 50 where typically enough) in steps of 0.2. We\nare interested in precise measurements of the topological\ncharge density as a function of h but, for each configuration, this quantity is a discrete number that takes the\nvalues n/V , where n is an integer between 0 and V . It\nturns out that values of x much smaller than 1/V are\nvery difficult to measure and, with affordable statistics,\nthey suffer huge relative errors. The only way to have\nreliable measurements of x(h) for the smaller values of h\nis to consider large enough volumes. How large can be\nestimated using a linear extrapolation around h = 0: if\nwe write x(h = 0.2) \u2243 51 \u03c7t (h = 0) and impose the condition x(h = 0.2) \u2265 1/V we can get the minimum V value\nto be considered. Using again the available data [11] we\nget that for \u03b2 = 0.85, L has to be at least 100 while for\n\u03b2 = 0.9 a L \u2243 200 lattice is the best option.\nTo keep the updating procedure as simple as possible\nwe used a standard Metropolis algorithm and the main\nruns where L = 100, \u03b2 = 0.8, 0.85 with 106 configurations, L = 200, \u03b2 = 0.8, 0.85, 0.9 with 0.5 106 configurations.\nIn Fig. 1 we present the effective exponent \u03b3\u03bb (y) for\nthe L = 200 lattice at \u03b2 = 0.80 and \u03bb = 1.0. As for\nother cases [6] the data points follow a smooth curve\nand a quadratic function fits perfectly the data. The\nextrapolated value for y \u2192 0 is \u03b3\u03bb (0) = 1.003(5): a sharp\nindication for a spontaneously broken CP symmetry at\n\u03b8 = \u03c0. The same holds for different O(1) values of \u03bb and\nfor other lattice sizes and/or couplings.\nFollowing the procedure reported in [6] we can reconstruct, from the fits of y\u03bb (y), the order parameter dependence on \u03b8. The results for the order parameter at\n\u03b2 = 0.80 and \u03b2 = 0.85, for the L = 200 lattice, are shown\n\nFIG. 2: Topological charge density versus \u03b8/\u03c0 at \u03b2 = 0.8,\nL = 200 (upper points) and \u03b2 = 0.85, L = 200 (lower ones):\nfirst method (to guide the eyes the continuous curve joins\nthe points) and from y\u03bb extrapolation (diamonds, statistical\nerrors are smaller than the symbol and are not reported).\n\nin Fig. 2. Indistinguishable results were obtained using\nthe data of the L = 100 lattices, as expected if finite\nvolume effects are negligible.\nOn the same plot the output of the first method (based\non the determination of the probability distribution function) [5] is also reported: the agreement between the two\nprocedures is at (few) % level. These statements can be\nextended to the smallest gauge coupling available, with\nthe only difference that vertical scale of the plot (and consequently the jump of the topological charge for \u03b8 = \u03c0)\nreduces increasing \u03b2. For both methods the evaluation\nof statistical errors has been done computing the physical quantities starting from independent simulation runs.\nIt comes out that the statistical error on the topological\ncharge density grows moderately with \u03b8 and for \u03b8 \u223c \u03c0\ntakes its maximum value that, for the three values \u03b2 =\n0.8, 0.85, 0.90 is of the order of 1, 2, 5% for the first\nmethod and 2, 3, 5% for the other one.\nThe fitting procedure used in both methods are potentially sources of systematical errors. Concerning the first\nmethod [5] we remind that, in order to extract the probability distribution function, we have to fit the h(x) data\npoints. In principle any choice that respects the known\nsymmetries (h(x) is an odd function) is admissible. We\nhave tried different function families and the best results\nwere obtained with h(x) = (a + bx2 + cx4 )asinh(dx);\nwith this 4-parameter function we were able to fit the\ndata over the entire x interval we were interested in,\nwith optimal \u03c72 /d.o.f. values. In particular we got\n\u03c72 /d.o.f. = 0.40 for \u03b2 = 0.80, \u03c72 /d.o.f. = 0.62 for\n\u03b2 = 0.85 and \u03c72 /d.o.f. = 0.67 for \u03b2 = 0.90.\nFor the second method [6] we also tried several different\nfunctions for fitting y\u03bb (y), obtaining fits of comparable\nquality, and identical results for the order parameter.\nFig. 2 is a a posteriori check of the validity of our\nestimation of errors: since the two approaches are so dif-\n\n\f4\nues. In Fig. 3 violations to asymptotic scaling are at\nmost \u00b16%. The origin of these violations could be the\nhigher order corrections to the perturbative renormalization group equation and then, as seen in the plot, we\nwould expect higher violations for the smaller \u03b2 value.\nIndeed, as shown in Fig. 4, the non perturbative scaling is realized with much better accuracy: the three\ncurves are now compatible within statistical errors. This\nis again a consistency check of both the results and the\nmethod(s).\n\nFIG. 3: Topological charge density divided by the squared\nlattice size (in units of \u039bL ) versus \u03b8/\u03c0 for \u03b2 = 0.80, 0.85, 0.90\n(continuous, dashed, dotted line respectively) in the L = 200\nlattice.\n\nTo conclude we want to emphasize that the continuum \u03b8 dependence of a confining and asymptotically free\nquantum field theory has been fully reconstructed. Data\ncollapse for different couplings within % level. The evidence for scaling in CP9 model at non zero \u03b8 is the\nstrongest indication that the CP symmetry is spontaneously broken in the continuum, as predicted by the\nlarge N expansion.\nThis work also shows how the inapplicability of the\nimportance sampling technique to simulate physically interesting \u03b8-vacuum models can be successfully overcome.\nThe authors thank the Consorzio Ricerca Gran Sasso\nthat has provided the computer resources needed for this\nwork.

In Fig. 3 we\nplot the continuum topological charge density, x(\u03b8)/a2 ,\nin units of the lattice \u039bL renormalization group parameter, related to the lattice spacing a by the two\nloop perturbative renormalization group equation: a =\n2/N\n\u039b\u22121\nexp(\u22122\u03c0\u03b2). Note that a2 varies by a factor\nL (2\u03c0\u03b2)\nof 4 in the considered \u03b2 interval. In Fig. 4 we plot the\nlattice topological charge density normalized by the measured topological susceptibility at \u03b8 = 0. In both cases we\nplot the first method results only since, as stated above,\nthose obtained with the second approach are practically\nnot distinguishable.\nWe see a good data collapse of plots at different \u03b2 val-\n\n[1] See R.D.
