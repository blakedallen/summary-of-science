Its components are well characterized [1, 2, 3],\nand they can be summarized as a bilayer membrane, coupled to a thin tenuous cytoskeleton of spectrin filaments\nvia two complexes of a few different proteins (ankyrin,\nband 3 and band 4.1). This outer membrane, held under tension by the cortical cytoskeleton, encloses a solution of dense haemoglobin. Despite its simplicity, the\nproperties of this structure have puzzled researchers for\ndecades. Investigations have focussed on two, related aspects: explaining the biconcave discocyte shape that is\nfound under physiological conditions (and a whole array\nof other morphologies that are found under perturbation\nor disease); measuring the mechanical properties of the\nstructure. Regarding the shape, significant progress has\nbeen made recently showing how, by carefully balancing\nthe membrane bending elasticity with a tension from the\nunderlying spectrin scaffold, the discocyte shape emerges\nas the equilibrium solution, and the cup-shaped stomatocyte is the result of a perturbation that decreases the\nmembrane area relative to the underlying skeleton[3]. On\nthe issue of mechanics and dynamics of the structure, our\nunderstanding is still very limited, despite the great importance of these parameters. Large deformations of the\ncell are involved in blood flow through thin capillaries,\nand the cells in suspension more generally determine the\nperipheral blood rheology in healthy and diseased conditions [4]. The red blood cell has variously been described\nas either liquid or solid [5].\nIn this Letter we investigate the dynamical mechanical\nproperties of the red blood cell by measuring its viscoelasticity over a range of environmental conditions. We\nfocus on the effect of the cell age, of the deformation\ndynamics, and the correlation between the cell modulus\nand its shape. We relate the findings to phenomenological models for flow in kinetically arrested systems,\nand to recent models describing the metabolic activity\nof the RBC, where the consumption of ATP controls\nthe stiffness of the elastic network [6, 7, 8]. The nor-\n\nmal biconcave human RBC has approximately 25% more\nmembrane surface area than the minimum required to\nenclose its volume, allowing deformations without extension of the membrane [9]. Therefore the mechanical response of the cell is related only to its bending and shear\nelastic moduli, and its membrane and bulk viscosities.\nThese quantities have been measured with various techniques, in particular micropipette aspiration, shape flickering, deformation in flow, and optical tweezers. Existing\nmeasurements give very different values. For example,\nindependent experiments using micropipette aspiration\nyield a shear modulus of between 6 and 10\u03bcN/m [10].\nOptical tweezers measurements report a wide range of\nshear modulus, but the discrepancies between these results are in part the result of applying different geometrical models to extract the modulus from the measured\nforces: 2.5\u00b10.4\u03bcN/m assuming a flat disk geometry[11];\n200\u03bcN/m assuming a spherical initial shape [12, 13]; 11\nto 18\u03bcN/m comparing to a finite element simulation of\nthe deformation [14]. A satisfactory approximation for\nthe deformation geometry is still not available, and is not\nthe topic of this Letter. We choose instead to report the\ndirectly measured mechanical properties, showing that\neven the model-independent dynamical stiffness of the\ncell is strongly dependent on the deformation protocol.\nOur key result is that the RBCs response cannot be explained within the framework of linear viscoelasticity.\nFresh blood was drawn from a healthy volunteer donor,\nand diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with\nacid citrate dextrose (Sigma C3821) and 1mg/ml bovine\nserum albumin (BSA) (Sigma A4503) at pH7.4. For\nstudying the effect of aging time after drawing, cells were\nincubated with glucose-free PBS either in a hot bath\nplate at 37o C for 24h with 10\u22122 Penicillin-Streptomycin\nsolution (GIBCO, Invitrogen 15070063) to prevent microbial growth, or at 4o C for 24h. A first control group was\nformed by adding 1mM MgATP (Sigma A9189), after\nthe 24h incubation, to the the RBCs in glucose-free PBS\nsuspension. A second control group was incubated with\n100mg/dl glucose in PBS buffer. These protocols provide\n\n\f2\nsamples that are a mixture of discocyte and stomatocyte\ncells, with an increasing fraction of discocytes after 1\nday's incubation.\nThe optical tweezers setup consists of a laser (IPG\nPhotonics, PYL-1-1064-LP, \u03bb=1064nm, Pmax =1.1W) focused through a water immersion objective (Zeiss, Achroplan IR 63x/0.90 W) trapping from below. The laser\nbeam is steered via a pair of acousto-optic deflectors (AA\nOpto-Electronic, AA.DTS.XY-250@1064nm) controlled\nby custom built electronics allowing multiple trap generation with sub nanometer position resolution. The trapping potential is locally described by a harmonic spring,\nand the trap stiffness was calibrated by measuring the\nthermal displacements of a trapped bead. The trapping\nstiffness at maximum power when trapping two beads (as\nin this work) is ktrap =44pN/\u03bcm on each bead. The sample is illuminated with a halogen lamp and is observed\nin bright field with a fast CMOS camera (Allied Vision\nTechnologies, Marlin F-131B).\nCarboxylated silica beads of 5.0\u03bcm diameter (Bangs\nLabs) were washed in Mes buffer (Sigma M1317). They\nwere then functionalized by resuspending in Mes buffer\nand incubating for 8h at 37o C with Lectin (0.25mg/ml)\n(Sigma L9640) and EDC (Sigma E1769) (4mg/ml). This\nmade them very sticky to the RBC, probably through\nbinding to glicoproteins or sugars on the outer side of\nthe RBC membrane. To prevent the RBCs from sticking\non the glass surfaces of the chamber, BSA was coated\non the slide glass. Using the tweezers, two beads are\nbrought to an RBC and attached diametrically across a\ncell, which is then floated well above the glass slide surface (at about 10 times the bead diameter) to minimize\nany hydrodynamic drag from the solid surface. The cells\nare quite monodisperse in size, with an initial cell length\n(the diameter) L0 \u223c 8\u03bcm. The area of contact between\nthe bead and the cell varies in the range 3-4.5\u03bcm2 , and\nwe find no correlation of the patch area with any of the\nexperimental results.

A cross marks the\npositions of the laser trap and a star marks the center of the\nbead, obtained via image analysis. (a)-(d) Decays of the measured time-dependent cell stiffness \u03ba(t) as a function of time.\nThe plateau value has been subtracted. This data shows a\npower law decay with exponents \u22433/4.\n\nure 1. During all the deformation protocols, one laser\ntrap is kept fixed at its initial position, while the other\ntrap is moved away by a distance \u2206laser. We focus on\ntracking the bead in the immobile trap, measuring the\ndifference \u2206x between the bead and the known laser position using image analysis code written in Matlab. From\nthe displacement \u2206x, the stretching force is calculated.\nThe cell is elongated by a distance \u2206L = \u2206laser \u2212 2\u2206x,\nand we define the strain as \u03b3 = \u2206L/L0 . The resolution of bead position via image analysis on each frame is\naround 5nm, which translates into \u00b10.22pN of force resolution. This is significantly less than the random fluctuations caused by thermal noise. The cell stretching is\nrecorded at \u223c60 frames per second, and having checked\nthat we could not observe a variation between measurements done at room temperature and at 37o C, we report\non measurements made at room temperature. Temperature is known from previous studies to have only a slight\ninfluence on the mechanics of red blood cells [15, 16].\nWe perform stress relaxation experiments by moving just\none trap (i.e. moving one bead) by \u2206laser=3.5\u03bcm at\n20\u03bcm/s, and monitoring the force acting on the stationary bead. The force is observed to decay towards a\nplateau value, which is reached within less than half a\nminute. We define the time-dependent stiffness of the\nred blood cell to be \u03ba(t) = F (t)/\u2206L(t). The whole set\nof experiments is fit very well by the 3-parameter power\nlaw function:\n\u03ba(t) = \u03ba\u221e + \u2206\u03ba(t) = \u03ba\u221e + \u2206\u03ba0 (t/t0 )\u2212\u03b1 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere we fix t0 = 1s to obtain a dimensionless time. We\nuse the first 20 seconds of the decay to fit these values,\nwhere there is less noise in the data, but it can be seen\nthat the power law decay holds for longer times as well.\nIn contrast, a single exponential fails to fit the data and\neven a stretched exponential (4-parameters) gives a poor\nfit. Figure 1 shows examples of the time relaxation of\n\u2206\u03ba(t) plotted separately for each of discocyte and cup\nshaped stomatocyte cells, fresh and after one day of incubation. In all cases the stiffness is fit over two decades\nin time by the form of Eq. 1. The power law exponents\nare the same within experimental error, the mean of all\nthe power law exponents measured is \u03b1=0.75\u00b10.16 for\nfresh cells and \u03b1=0.82\u00b10.09 for 1-day old cells. A total of 11 different cells were measured this way. The\nvalue of the ratio \u2206F0 /F\u221e , i.e. the fraction of the stress\nthat decays over time, also appears independent of shape\nand cell age, and is between 0.55 and 0.75. The fact\nthat the data is described so well by Eq. 1 implies that\nthere are two components to the cell elastic modulus:\na time-dependent and a long-time equilibrium modulus.\nPower-law relaxations are well known in systems near the\ngelation point and in entangled polymer solutions [17],\nhowever we anticipate here that we will discuss how for\nthe red blood cell the form of Eq. 1 does not originate\nfrom polymer relaxation nor gel cluster dynamics. To\ninvestigate further the strain rate dependence of the cell\nmodulus, we perform a triangle wave deformation exper-\n\n\f3\niment using speeds of 20, 5, 1 and 0.2\u03bcm/s, and 3.5\u03bcm\nlaser trap displacement [25]. Figure 2(a) shows that the\nforce measured over time is approximately proportional\nto the applied strain. The slight mismatch between the\napplied strain and the stress can be seen more clearly in\nFigure 2(b) as a hysteresis loop. There is a slight difference between the onset of the first cycle and all the\nfollowing ones: From observing many instances of this\nprotocol we believe that this is due to the cell rearranging its position precisely along the axis of the strain experiment. It is clear from this figure that there is no\nfurther evolution of the stress strain curves over the run,\nwhich lasts typically tens of cycles. The cell's response is\npredominantly elastic, and the gradient of the force vs.\nelongation data as in Figure 2(b), taken over the extension, gives the stiffness \u03ba of the cell. This stiffness is an\neffective property of the cell, a valid modulus for describing the cell's response in physiological processes such as\nsqueezing through thin capillaries. Our results show that\nthere can be a large (factor of three) difference between\nthe dynamic and static stiffness, as measured for example\nby micropipette. The experimental speed of deformation\ncan be converted into an approximate strain rate \u03b3\u0307 by\ndividing the bead velocity by the initial cell length (L0 ).\nThe cell stiffness is plotted in Figure 3 against the strain\nrate. These quantities are seen to be approximately related through the function:\n\u03ba(\u03b3\u0307) \u2212 \u03ba0 \u223c \u03b3\u0307 \u03b2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwith \u03b2 \u2243 41 .\nThe hysteresis in the stress strain curves is a measure of\nenergy dissipation in the cell, and is shown in Figure 3.\nIn order to compare results from different strain amplitudes, the dissipated energy is presented as the work per\ncycle, normalized by the square of the strain amplitude\n\u03b3max . The dissipated energy follows a power law as a\nfunction of strain rate, with an exponent that we assume\nis the same \u03b2 as in Eq. 2. In all the cells the strain rate\ndependence is well below the linear relation expected for\na purely viscous system.

Solid line is a linear fit to the force during\nextension, the area inside the hysteresis loop is the energy\ndissipated per cycle.\n\nafter one day's incubation. These values have a higher\nprecision than the stress relaxation exponents because\nthe triangle wave cycle is repeated many times. [26] In\nlinear viscoelasticity, the dependence of the modulus on\nthe strain rate is related to the form of the stress relaxation via a modified Laplace transform [17]. In the case\nof a power law decay with \u03ba(t) \u2212 \u03ba\u221e \u223c t\u2212\u03b1 , we expect\n\u03ba(\u03b3\u0307) \u2212 \u03ba0 \u223c \u03b3\u0307 \u03b1 . This is very clearly not the case here,\nthe exponent \u03b2 is much smaller than \u03b1. This points to\nthe fact that even though our strain amplitudes are not\nvery large, only of the order of 20%, our experiment is\nin a nonlinear regime. This finding can be understood as\nfollows: the power law relaxation is the manifestation of\na system where at least a fraction of the bonds can break\nunder stress and quickly reform, essentially remodeling\nthe skeleton's network. There is an analogy between this\nmolecular-scale picture and the more general situation of\nthe rheology of a system where the components have to\novercome potential barriers in order to flow. This condition is addressed by the soft glassy rheology (SGR) model\nwhich, assuming a distribution of energy wells of different\ndepths, provides a framework for calculating the nonlinear response of the system[18]. It contains one principal\nparameter, x, which is the ratio between the available\nenergy and the mean well depth. For x < 1 the model is\nin a glassy phase. The shear modulus is predicted to decay with time as G \u223c t\u2212x , and the stress under constant\nstrain rate is \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3y \u223c \u03b3\u0307 1\u2212x . The red blood cell power\nlaws and exponents appears to be well described by the\nSGR model with a value of x \u2243 3/4. In the red blood\ncell it is likely that the potential barriers to be overcome\nare the energies for releasing a spectrin filament from a\ncrosslink. The filament would then re-bond in a configuration of lower stress. The presence of a long lived\nresidual stress in the stress relaxation implies either the\npresence of a fraction of permanent bonds, or of a kinetically arrested state with residual stress, leading to a\ndeviation from a purely power law scaling at low strain\nrates which is visible in the stiffness data of Figure 3.\nIn the absence of external stresses it is known that ATP\nis required to open the spectrin-actin linker, whose bond\nenergy is around 7kB T, i.e. 3\u00d710\u221220J [19, 20]. Based\non the known mesh size of the cytoskeleton (between 80100nm) and the cell surface area, we can estimate the\norder of magnitude of the number of bonds to be 104 .\nGiven that the dissipated energy per cycle is of the order\nof 10\u221217 J this implies that either only a small fraction of\nthe bonds, around 3%, is broken during a cycle, or that\nthe bond energies under stress are reduced considerably,\nor that ATP and not solely mechanical energy is being\nused to break the bonds. Of these possibilities the agreement with the soft glassy rheology observed here suggests\nthat remodeling of the linkers under stress does not involve the full cost of breaking the spectrin-actin linker.\nWhile the features of the dynamical response of all the\ncells are the same, we observe differences in the magnitude of the response depending on the shape of cell and\nthe incubation protocol.

Markers indicate the different conditions studied here: (H) fresh-Discotic; (\u25bd) fresh-Stomatocyte;\n(\u2022) 1day-Discotic; (\u25e6) 1day-Stomatocyte; (\u0004) 1day-discotic\n+MgATP.\n\ning to a decrease of the cell modulus of almost a factor\nof 2 after 1 day of incubation, is the time from when\nthe cells are drawn. Secondary to this aging, we observe a correlation between the stiffness of the cell and\nits shape. The cup-shaped stomatocytes are almost twice\nas stiff as the discotic cells. Models proposed recently describe the active remodelling of the RBC's cytoskeletal\nnetwork [8, 20]. ATP is expected to be strongly related\nto this activity, at least under absence of an external\nforce [8]. It is of interest that flickering of the membrane\nat low frequencies was shown to depend on the intracel-\n\n[1] B. Alberts, D. Bray, J. Lewis, M. Raff, K. Roberts, and\nJ. D.

Through the 1-day incubation protocol the ATP concentration inside the cell\nis depleted, and according to these references this would\nlead to stiffer cells. Our results showing softening seem\nto imply an opposite effect, one possibility is that under\nreduction of ATP the cell loses some of its ability to reform the bonds that break under deformation. We find\nno appreciable difference between aging in the absence of\nglucose and in physiological glucose concentrations (data\nnot shown). We find a strong effect adding MgATP to an\naged cell: MgATP causes an increase of both the stiffness\nand dissipation for the discotic cells, bringing the values\nclose to those of freshly drawn cells.\nThe rate dependence of the cell modulus measured in this\nwork can be also be compared to recent data obtained by\nmonitoring the deformation induced via magnetic twisting cytometry (MTC). This is essentially a creep experiment performed on a pivoting magnetic bead bound to\nthe outside of a red blood cell [22]. In MTC there is\nalmost certainly a large influence of the membrane bending elasticity, and the data in ref. [22] is dominated by\na source of elasticity that is not found in our measurements with optical tweezers. Our data confirms that the\ndynamics in the red blood cell, as also pointed out by\nSuresh and collaborators, is intrinsically free of a characteristic timescale [22]. In addition we have shown here\nthat the dynamics is not linear, and therefore depends on\nthe deformation protocol, even for small deformations.\nThis may be relevant to other cell types. Our findings\nhere are in contrast to many previous investigations of\nthe red blood cell [11, 14, 23], where limited datasets led\nto simplistic conclusions regarding the dynamics.\nWe acknowledge funding by the Oppenheimer Fund, EPSRC, and the Cavendish-KAIST programme of MoST\nKorea.
