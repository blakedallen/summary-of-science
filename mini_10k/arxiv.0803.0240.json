INTRODUCTION\n\nThe concept of feedback due to outflows is a potential key ingredient in understanding the coevolution\nof galaxies and black holes (Silk & Rees 1998, Fabian\n1999, Wyithe & Loeb 2003). Recent analytic estimates\nand simulations demonstrate the importance of feedback\nfrom winds/outflows for instance in cosmic downsizing\n(Scannapieco et al. 2005), in fixing the MBH \u2212 \u03c3 relation (di Matteo et al. 2005), and in determining galaxy\ncolors (Springel et al. 2005) by regulating star formation\nin the host galaxy. Powerful gaseous outflows in Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN) deposit mass, energy and metals\nin the interstellar medium of the galaxy and the inter-\n\ngalactic medium or intracluster medium (Colbert et al.\n1996, Churazov et al. 2001, Moll et al. 2007). AGN\nwinds also play a potentially important role in unified\nmodels of AGN (Elvis 2000, 2006).\nObservational evidence for outflows in AGN exists on\nvarious scales and in all wavebands from the radio (Morganti et al. 2005, Gallimore et al. 2006), to the IR\n(Rodriguez-Ardila et al. 2006), optical (Das et al. 2005),\nUV (Sulentic et al. 2007, Rodriguez Hidalgo et al. 2007,\nCrenshaw & Kraemer 2007), and X-ray band (Chelouche\n& Netzer 2005, Krongold et al. 2007); see Veilleux et\nal. (2005) for a review. There are several lines of evidence that outflows are particularly strong in narrow-line\nSeyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies. NLS1 galaxies are a subclass\n\n\f2\n\nKomossa et al.\n\nof AGN with extreme emission-line and continuum properties which appear to be in part driven by their high\nEddington ratios, low black hole masses, and other parameters (e.g., Osterbrock & Pogge 1985, Boroson 2002,\nGrupe 2004; see Komossa 2008 for a review). The high\nEddington ratios likely lead to strong, radiation-pressure\ndriven outflows.\nAs a class of objects with low black hole masses, high\naccretion rates and strong winds, the location of NLS1\ngalaxies on the MBH \u2212 \u03c3 plane is of special interest\n(Mathur et al. 2001; see our Sect. 4.1). Komossa & Xu\n(2007) have shown that NLS1 galaxies follow the same\nMBH \u2212 \u03c3 relation as normal and broad-line Seyfert 1\n(BLS1) galaxies, if the width of the [SII]6716,6731 emission lines is used as a surrogate for stellar velocity dispersion. The width of [OIII]5007 (after removal of asymmetric blue wings) is still a good proxy for stellar velocity dispersion in BLS1 and NLS1 galaxies, with one\nimportant exception. A subset of NLS1 galaxies deviates systematically from the MBH \u2212 \u03c3 relation, and all\nof these are characterized by high [OIII] blueshifts. At\nthe same time, the [SII]-based measurements of velocity\ndispersion of the same objects still place them on the\nMBH \u2212 \u03c3 relation (Fig. 1). Therefore, the [OIII] lines of\nthese particular galaxies were not suitable to estimate \u03c3.\nHowever, the independent question is raised as to which\nmechanism drives these [OIII] line blueshifts, and what\nwe can learn from them regarding the nature of these systems and perhaps the evolutionary state of NLS1 galaxies. That is the topic of this study.\nA measurable difference in blueshifts and widths of different NLR emission lines has been recognized early (review by Osterbrock 1991). The phenomenon of strong\n[OIII] blueshifts exceeding one\u2013several hundred km s\u22121\n(so-called blue outliers), is more rare. It has been detected early in individual objects (Phillips 1976) but has\nonly been studied systematically recently (Zamanov et\nal. 2002, Marziani et al. 2003, Aoki et al. 2005, Boroson 2005, Bian et al. 2005). These studies have shown\nthat blue outliers have high Eddington ratios and small\nBalmer line widths (all of them with FWHM(H\u03b2) <\n4000 km s\u22121 , and most of them with FWHM(H\u03b2) < 2000\nkm s\u22121 ; Marziani et al. 2003). It has remained uncertain\nwhether there is (Bian et al. 2005) or is not (Aoki et al.\n2005) a direct correlation between [OIII] blueshift and\nEddington ratio. Common to most studies is the presence of a strong correlation between [OIII] blueshift and\n[OIII] line width. This correlation is also known among\niron coronal lines of BLS1 galaxies (Penston et al. 1984,\nErkens et al. 1997). The reason is not yet well understood. Outflows are thought to play a role in explaining\nthe phenomenon.\nExcept Boroson (2005) all sample studies concentrated\non the [OIII]-H\u03b2 region of optical spectra of blue outliers in order to examine the phenomenon, while for the\nfirst time we include information from all the detected\noptical NLR lines. We report the detection of strong\ncorrelations and discuss consequences for the nature of\nblue outliers and for dynamical NLR models. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the\nsample selection and provide details on the data analysis. Results on trends and correlations are presented in\nSect. 3 which are then discussed in Sect. 4. A sum-\n\nmary and conclusions are given in Sect. 5. Some individual objects turn out to be remarkable. Notes on them\nare provided in an Appendix. We use a cosmology with\nH0 =70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9M =0.3 and \u03a9\u039b =0.7 throughout\nthis paper.\n2. DATA ANALYSIS\n2.1. The sample\n\nThe nine NLS1 galaxies of the present work were drawn\nfrom the sample of Xu et al. (2007, 2008). The original\nsample selection and standard data reduction procedures\nwere described in detail in that work. In brief, the sample\nconsists of NLS1 galaxies from the catalogue of V\u00e9ronCetty & V\u00e9ron (2003) and a comparison sample of BLS1\ngalaxies from Boroson (2003) at redshift z < 0.3, which\nhave Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR3 (Abazajian et al. 2005) spectra available and which have detectable low-ionization lines (presence of [SII]6716,6731,\nwith S/N>5). The BLS1 and NLS1 galaxy samples\nhave similar redshift and absolute magnitude distributions. Xu et al. (2007) corrected the SDSS spectra for\nGalactic extinction, decomposed the continuum into host\ngalaxy and AGN components, and then subtracted the\nhost galaxy contribution and the FeII complexes from\nthe spectra. Emission line profiles of the galaxies were\nfit with Gaussians using the IRAF package SPECFIT\n(Kriss 1994). Measured FWHMs were corrected for instrumental broadening. Re-classification after spectral\nemission-line fitting led to 39 BLS1 and 55 NLS1 galaxies in the sample. We focus here on the nine galaxies with\nthe highest blueshifts of [OIII] (Tab. 1) which were identified by Komossa & Xu (2007; KX07 hereafter). Results\nfrom the complete NLS1 (and BLS1) sample are shown\nfor comparison purposes, and in order to identify trends\nacross the whole BLS1 \u2013 NLS1 \u2013 blue-outlier population.\nWhen we report measurements of optical FeII strength\n(FeII4570), this is the integrated flux of the FeII emission complex between the rest wavelengths 4434\u00c5 and\n4684\u00c5. We refer to the flux sum of the two Sulphur lines,\n[SII]6716 and [SII]6731, as [SII]6725.\n2.2. Emission-line fits and [OIII] profile\n\nThe Balmer lines were decomposed into three components, narrow core (H\u03b2n ; FWHM fixed to that determined for [SII]6716,6731), and two broad components.\nNo physical meaning is ascribed to the two separate\nbroad components; they merely serve as a mathematical\ndescription (see Xu et al. 2008 for alternative Lorentzian\nfits). The final width of the broad-line emission, H\u03b2b , is\ndetermined as the FWHM of the sum of the two Gaussians. With the exception of [OIII], forbidden lines are\nwell represented by single Gauss profiles. The total [OIII]\nemission-line profile, [OIII]totl , was decomposed into two\nGaussian components, a narrow core ([OIII]c ) and broad\nbase. We distinguish between two types of [OIII] spectral complexity: (1) the presence of such a broad base\nwhich tends to be blue-asymmetric (e.g., Heckman et al.\n1981), and is referred to as \"blue wing\", and (2) systematic blueshifts of the whole core of [OIII]. Objects which\nshow this latter phenomenon are called \"blue outliers\"\n(Zamanov et al. 2002)1 . Measurements of the FWHM\n1 Note that we use a velocity shift of v\n\u22121 in\n[OIII]c >150 km s\norder to refer to an object as [OIII] blue outlier; while Zamanov\n\n\f[OIII] blue outliers\nand blueshift of [OIII] reported in this work refer to the\ncore of the emission-line, unless noted otherwise.\nIdeally, measurements of the velocity shift of [OIII]\nshould be done relative to the galaxy restframe, as defined by stellar absorption lines from the host galaxy.\nHowever, these features are generally weak or absent in\nour galaxies (and in NLS1 galaxies in general). We therefore measure velocity shifts of [OIII] and of all other lines\nrelative to [SII]. We use positive velocity values to refer\nto blueshifts, negative ones for redshift. The shifts of\nH\u03b2 and other low-ionization lines ([OI]6300, NII[6584],\n[OII]3727) agree well with [SII], while other highionization lines ([NeIII]3861, [NeV]3426, and iron coronal\nlines) are characterized by high blueshifts (Sect. 3.3). If\nlines were too faint to be fit by a Gaussian of free width,\nwe used fixed width instead (fixed to FWHM([SII])\nfor low-ionization lines or to FWHM([OIII]c ) for highionization lines) and determined the central wavelength\nto measure the blueshift. Results are reported in Tab.\n1. Since the redshifts provided by the SDSS pipeline are\ndetermined based on all strong detected emission lines\nand are therefore influenced by the blueshifted [OIII],\nwe have re-measured redshifts based on H\u03b2n . It is these\nredshifts that are given in Tab. 1. We have measured\nthe average [OIII]totl /[SII]6725 ratios of our BLS1 and\nNLS1 galaxy sample. We find that, in terms of this ratio,\ntheir NLRs are similar, with <[OIII]totl /[SII]6725>=5\nin BLS1 galaxies, and <[OIII]totl /[SII]6725>=4 in NLS1\ngalaxies.\nNotes on individual objects are given in the Appendix. Here, we briefly comment on the detection of\n[FeX]6375 in two blue outliers. In PG1244+026 [FeX] is\nblended with [OI]6365. For decomposition, the width\nof [OI]6365 was fixed to that of [OI]6300. The twocomponent fit then reproduces the expected ratio of\n[OI]6300/[OI]6365 \u2248 3. [FeX] is blueshifted by 640\nkm s\u22121 . In RXJ0135\u22120043, [FeX] overlaps with atmospheric O2 which is imperfectly corrected for. Therefore,\nthe width of [FeX] was fixed to that of [OIII]. This gives\nan outflow velocity of 990 km s\u22121 .\n2.3. Robustness of spectral fits: continuum and line\n\ndecomposition\nIn order to see how much the fitting procedure affects measurements of [OIII] fluxes, asymmetries and\nblueshifts, we have repeated the spectral analysis several times under different conditions and assumptions:\nWe have fit the host-galaxy-corrected, FeII subtracted\nspectrum and for comparison the original SDSS spectrum without any of these corrections. We have re-fit\nthe [OIII] profile in a number of different ways, and with\ndifferent Gaussian decompositions. The [OIII] profile\nwas fit using the red half of the profile only, or different fractions of the total profile, or only the upper 30%\nof the profile, or with a single and a double Gaussian\nprofile. Fitting the profile with one single Gaussian component maximizes the blueshift in objects with significant [OIII] blue wings. In all other cases, uncertainties in line blueshifts due to non-subtraction of a host\ngalaxy contribution and due to different line fitting procedures are typically much less than 50 km s\u22121 . The\net al. (2002) use this terminology for objects with v[OIII] >250\nkm s\u22121 , where [OIII] outflow velocity is measured relative to H\u03b2.\n\n3\n\nblueshift independently determined from the weaker line\n[OIII]4959 also agrees with [OIII]5007 within better than\n50 km s\u22121 . Four of our galaxies are also in the sample of\nBoroson (2005). His [OIII] blueshift measurements agree\nwith ours within typically better than \u00b110 km s\u22121 . Uncertainties in FWHM of the core of [OIII] are typically\n30% for [OIII] lines with extra blue wing (smaller in others), and are due to uncertainties in decomposition. We\nnote in passing that the frequency of [OIII] blue wings\nin blue outliers is neither particularly high nor low (see\nalso Boroson 2005).\n3. RESULTS\n3.1. Constraints on the presence/absence of blueshifted\n\nemission lines\nIn order to facilitate a systematic discussion of NLR\nmodels of blue outliers (Sect. 4.3), we have investigated whether the non-shifted low-ionization lines have\na (faint) high-ionization [OIII] counterpart and vice\nversa2. We did this representatively for the three galaxies with the highest [OIII] blueshifts (SBS0919+515,\nSDSSJ11555+0107 and RXJ01354\u22120043), and for the\ngalaxy with the highest S/N (PG1244+026). We have\nexamined the following three questions:\n(1) Is there any [OIII] emission at zero blueshift present\nin the spectrum (which could originate from the inner\nNLR; or be counterpart to the low-ionization emission\nlines from the outer NLR) ? In order to test this, we have\nenforced an extra Gaussian line contribution to [OIII]\nat zero blueshift (or at v[OIII] = 50 km s\u22121 , the average value of our NLS1 sample excluding blue outliers)\nand of fixed FWHM([OIII]extra )=FWHM([SII]). We find\nthat, if present, it must be very weak. The average ratio\n[OIII]totl /[SII]6725 in our BLS1 sample is 5, while in our\nNLS1 sample it is 4. This value of 4 is much higher than\nthe upper limit on the extra component which was fit\nto the observed spectra: Typically, [OIII]extra /[SII]6725\n\u2248 0.1 \u2212 0.4, and always, [OIII]extra /[SII]6725 < 1. Since\nthe ratio of [OIII]/[SII] of nearby Seyfert galaxies generally decreases in dependence of radius (in models and observations; Komossa & Schulz 1997, Bennert et al. 2006)\nand since there must be an [OIII] contribution from the\nouter [SII] emitting clouds, the limits derived on any nonblueshifted [OIII] contribution from the inner NLR are\nvery tight.\n(2) Does the blueshifted [OIII] have a blueshifted H\u03b2\ncounterpart ? I.e., how much highly blueshifted H\u03b2 could\nbe 'hidden' in the H\u03b2 profile ? In order to check this, we\nhave re-fit H\u03b2 adding an additional Gaussian to describe\nits profile with parameters of this extra component fixed\nat vH\u03b2extra = v[OIII]c , FWHM(H\u03b2extra )=FWHM([OIII]c )\nand an intensity ratio [OIII]c /H\u03b2extra =10. We find that\nsuch a weak component could generally be hidden in the\nH\u03b2 profile.\n(3) Does the blueshifted [OIII] have a blueshifted lowionization counterpart in [SII] ? This is not the case. For\ntypical spatially averaged ratios of [OIII]/[SII]6725 \u22484\nof our NLS1 sample, blueshifted [SII] lines would have\n2 Note that, apart from [OIII], other high-ionization lines show\nblueshifts, too (Sect. 3.3.1), but they are too faint for multicomponent line decompositions. Among the non-shifted emission\nlines, [SII] is the strongest unblended line, and we therefore focus\non [SII] for the corresponding estimates in this section.\n\n\f4\n\nKomossa et al.\n\ngenerally been detectable, but are absent. Very faint\nblueshifted [SII], as it may arise in the inner NLR, cannot\nbe excluded with the present data.\nIn summary, we find (1) little evidence for zeroblueshift [OIII] emission (the amount of emission consistent with the spectra likely originates from the outer\nparts of the NLR which also emits in [SII] and other lowionization lines); (2) an extra blueshifted component in\nH\u03b2 \u2013 the expected counterpart to blueshifted [OIII]\u2013 can\nbe hidden in the H\u03b2 profile; and (3) there is no detectable\nhighly blueshifted component in the low-ionization lines.\n3.2. Estimates of black holes masses, Eddington ratios\n\nand NLR densities\nBlack hole masses were estimated by using the\nradius(RBLR )-luminosity(L) relation of BLS1 galaxies as\nreported by Kaspi et al. (2005) and the width of H\u03b2.\nThe luminosities at 5100\u00c5 were taken from Xu et al.\n(2008) and are based on SDSS g* and r* magnitudes\ncorrected for Galactic extinction. Since we lack multiwavelength spectral energy distributions, the bolometric\nluminosity Lbol was estimated using a standard bolometric correction of Lbol = 9 \u03bbL5100 (Kaspi et al. 2000).\nLEdd was calculated from the black hole mass, according to LEdd = 1.3 1038 MBH /M\u2299 erg/s. Typical errors\nin individual BH mass estimates can be as large as 0.5\ndex, and arise from the use of single-epoch data, and\nuncertainties in H\u03b2 decomposition and in host galaxy\ncontribution. The NLR density was derived from the\ndensity-sensitive [SII] intensity ratio, [SII]6716/[SII]6731\n(Xu et al. 2007).\n3.3. Trends and correlations\nWe have checked for (1) trends of outflow velocity with\nother (atomic) parameters within each single spectrum,\nand (2) for trends across our sample of blue outliers (do\nall blue outliers have high Eddington ratios, high black\nhole masses, etc. ?), and (3) for trends across our whole\nsample of BLS1 and NLS1 galaxies.\n3.3.1. A strong correlation of line shift with ionization\npotential\n\nWe detect a strong correlation between emission-line\nblueshift and ionization potential (Fig. 3). While the\nlow-ionization forbidden lines of [OI], [OII] and [NII],\nand the Balmer lines H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 are at velocities very\nsimilar to [SII], high-ionization lines on the other hand\nshow strong blueshifts which increase with ionization potential. Two galaxies (SDSSJ115533.50+010730.4 and\nPG1244+026) show extreme blueshifts in [Fe X], on the\norder of 600-1000 km s\u22121 . There is also a correlation\nbetween outflow velocity and critical density of the individual line transitions (Fig. 3), but it is less tight in the\nsense that [OI]6300, which has low ionization potential\nbut high critical density, does not follow the trend.\n3.3.2. Trends and correlations of [OIII] blueshift with line\nand galaxy parameters\n\nWe have correlated the [OIII] blueshifts (of the blue\noutliers, and of our sample as a whole) with various\nother line parameters (line widths, line ratios) and with\ngalaxy properties (absolute magnitude, black hole mass,\n\nEddington ratio, NLR density). The strongest correlation is the one between [OIII] blueshift and [OIII] line\nwidth (Spearman rank correlation coefficient rS =0.6 for\nthe whole NLS1 sample and even higher for just the blue\noutliers; Fig. 3). Within the NLS1 sample, there is a\ntrend that blue outliers preferentially avoid low Eddington ratios L/Ledd and low FeII/H\u03b2 ratios. Most blue outliers have small ratios of [OIII]/H\u03b2totl . We do not find\ntrends of outflow velocity with NLR density ne , black\nhole mass, absolute magnitude Mi , and the width of the\nbroad component of H\u03b2 (Fig. 4). However, while trends\nare absent within the NLS1 population itself, it is interesting to note that the presence of blue outliers amplifies\ntrends which become apparent when the BLS1 galaxies\nare added to the correlation plots (Fig. 4).\n3.4. Frequency of blue outliers\n\nAmong our sample, blue outliers only occur in NLS1\n> 150 km s\u22121 , we have\ngalaxies. At a velocity v[OIII] \u223c\n> 250\na blue outlier fraction of 16%. If we use v[OIII] \u223c\n\u22121\nkm s instead, as in Zamanov et al. (2002), the fraction\nof blue outliers among NLS1 galaxies is 5%.\n4. DISCUSSION\n4.1. The locus of Seyfert galaxies with [OIII] blueshifts\n\non the MBH \u2212 \u03c3 plane\nInvestigating the location of different types of galaxies on the MBH \u2212 \u03c3 plane, and their potential evolution\nacross the plane, is of great interest in the context of\ngalaxy formation and evolution models. In AGN, stellar\nvelocity dispersion is often difficult to measure, and the\nwidth of [OIII] has become a convenient proxy for stellar\nvelocity dispersion (e.g., Terlevich et al. 1990, Whittle\n1992, Nelson & Whittle 1996, Nelson 2000, Shields et\nal. 2003, Boroson 2003, Greene & Ho 2005, Netzer and\nTrakhtenbrot 2007, Salviander et al. 2007) after removing [OIII] blue wings and excluding galaxies with powerful kiloparsec-scale linear radio sources. The scatter in\nthe relation is larger than in the original MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relation (Ferrarese & Merritt 2000, Gebhardt et al. 2000),\nand indicates secondary influences on the gas kinematics\n(e.g., Nelson & Whittle 1996, Rice et al. 2006).\nMathur et al. (2001) pointed out the importance of\nstudying the locus of NLS1 galaxies on the MBH \u2212 \u03c3\nplane, which was the focus of a number of subsequent\nstudies (Wang & Lu 2001, Wandel 2002, Botte et al.\n2004, 2005, Bian et al. 2004, Grupe & Mathur 2004,\nBarth et al. 2005, Greene & Ho 2005, Mathur & Grupe\n2005a,b, Zhou et al. 2006, Ryan et al. 2007, Watson et\nal. 2007, Komossa & Xu 2007). Any such study would\ninvolve one important step: the distinction between true\noutliers from the MBH \u2212 \u03c3 relation on the one hand, and\napparent outliers on the other hand. Apparent outliers\nwould only appear to be off-set from the MBH \u2212\u03c3 relation\nbecause either the choice of line width as a measure of\nstellar velocity dispersion was unsuitable, or the choice of\nline and continuum parameters as a measure of black hole\nmass was unsuitable. KX07 have shown that those NLS1\ngalaxies of their sample which deviate significantly from\nthe MBH \u2212 \u03c3 relation of normal (and BLS1) galaxies are\nall characterized by high [OIII] blueshifts. While these\n[OIII] lines were therefore not suited as surrogate for stellar velocity dispersion, the [SII]-based measurements of\n\n\f[OIII] blue outliers\nvelocity dispersion of the very same objects still located\nthem on the MBH \u2212 \u03c3 relation. Almost all galaxies which\ndeviate most strongly from the MBH \u2212\u03c3 relation (see our\nFig. 1) show v[OIII] > 150 km s\u22121 . These six objects,\nplus three additional ones which also show v[OIII] > 150\nkm s\u22121 define the nine blue outliers that are the target\nof the present study.\nIn order to measure systematically the deviation of a\ngalaxy from the MBH \u2212\u03c3\u2217 relation, we define the quantity\n\u2206\u03c3 := log \u03c3obs \u2212 log \u03c3pred (as in KX07), where \u03c3obs is the\nobserved emission-line velocity dispersion, and \u03c3pred is\nthe stellar velocity dispersion predicted from the MBH \u2212\n\u03c3\u2217 relation of Ferrarese & Ford (2005). We find a strong\ncorrelation between [OIII] blueshift v[OIII] and \u2206\u03c3 (Fig.\n1). This finding demonstrates that [OIII] velocity shift\nsystematically affects the deviation of an object from the\nMBH \u2212\u03c3 relation (see also Boroson 2005). We further find\nthat a correlation between L/LEdd and \u2206\u03c3 (e.g., Mathur\n& Grupe 2005, Greene & Ho 2005; see also Netzer &\nTrakhtenbrot 2007) is only present in our sample if we\ninclude blue outliers; when they are removed from the\nsample, no correlation remains (last panel of our Fig. 4,\nsee also KX07).\nTwo of our NLS1 blue outliers have independent BH\nmass estimates. From X-ray variability, Czerny et al.\n(2001) estimated log MBH = 5.9 for PG1244+062 which\nagrees well with our estimate from applying the RBLR L relation (log MBH = 6.2). For RX01354\u22120043 we\ndirectly measured \u03c3\u2217 from stellar absorption lines (see\nAppendix). The value agrees well with \u03c3[SII] and puts\nRXJ01354\u22120043 almost perfectly on the MBH -\u03c3\u2217 relation (Fig. 1).\nThese findings demonstrate the importance of measuring [OIII] blueshifts, and removing objects with high\nblueshifts from a sample before putting it on the MBH \u2212\n\u03c3[OIII] relation. The independent question arises as to\nwhat may cause the blueshifts of these [OIII] outliers.\n4.2. Blue outliers: trends and correlations\n\nThe phenomenon of slightly different blueshifts and\nline widths of NLR emission lines has been recognized\nsince the early days of AGN spectroscopy and is generally traced back to a certain stratification of the NLR\nin the sense that high-ionization lines are produced preferentially at small distances from the core, while lowionization lines are preferentially produced at larger radii\n(e.g., Osterbrock 1991). The presence of a strong [OIII]\nblueshift on the order of several hundred km s\u22121 was noticed early in the prototype NLS1 galaxy IZw13 (e.g.,\nPhillips 1976, V\u00e9ron-Cetty et al. 2004). The galaxy also\nshows very blueshifted IR coronal lines (Schinnerer et\nal. 1998) and blueshifted UV high-ionization broad lines\n(Laor et al. 1997).\nSeveral recent studies systematically examined the\nphenomenon of blue outliers in larger samples of type\n1 Seyfert galaxies (Zamanov et al. 2002, Marziani et al.\n2003, Aoki et al. 2005, Boroson 2005, Bian et al. 2005).\nAccording to these studies blue outliers have high Ed3 It is also known in some radio galaxies [e.g., PKS1549-79 (Tadhunter et al. 2001, Holt et al. 2006), IC5063 (Morganti et al. 2007),\nand PKS0736+01 (Zamanov et al. 2002, Marziani et al. 2003)].\nAlso note systematic blueshifts in high-ionization BLR emission\nlines in quasar samples (e.g., Gaskell 1982, Sulentic et al. 2007).\n\n5\n\ndington ratios and small BLR Balmer line widths. However, not all sources with high Eddington ratios are blue\noutliers. While Bian et al. (2005) further reported a correlation between blueshift and Eddington ratio of their\n7 blue outliers, Aoki et al. (2005) did not find such a\ncorrelation for 16 objects. A strong correlation between\n[OIII] blueshift and [OIII] line width is often seen, and\nis usually interpreted as evidence for outflows. Zamanov\net al. (2002) noticed that most of their blue outliers also\nshow high blueshifts in CIV1549 (but this phenomenon\nis not exclusive to blue outliers; Sulentic et al. 2007).\nAoki et al. (2005) reported a trend that blue outliers\nhave high black hole masses (> 107 M\u2299 ). All previous\nstudies of samples of blue outliers focused on the [OIII]H\u03b2 spectral region in order to explore the phenomenon,\nwith the exception of Boroson (2005). Although Boroson (2005) measured the positions of other NLR lines\nin order to establish a systemic reference for the [OIII]\nline properties, we have, for the first time, measured the\nwidths and strengths of all the optical NLR lines in blue\noutliers in order to study the nature of blue outliers and\nexplore the dynamics of the NLR.\nFor each galaxy, we find a strong correlation between\nemission line blueshift and ionization potential of the\nline-emitting ion. Coincidentally, higher ionization potentials of the ions in question also come with higher\ncritical densities of the forbidden line transitions observed from the respective ions. Therefore, a correlation between outflow velocity and ionization potential\nwould generally imply a correlation with critical density,\nand vice versa, raising the question which of the two\nis the fundamental correlation; density stratification or\nionization stratification. An important exception to the\nabove rule is [OI]6300, which has zero ionization potential, while its critical density (ncrit = 1.8 106 cm\u22123 ) is\nrelatively high. [OI] is detected in several of our NLS1\ngalaxies, and we find that [OI] follows the trend in ionization potential, but not in critical density, arguing that\nthe former correlation is the underlying one (Fig. 3)4 .\nWe confirm the previously known correlation between\n[OIII] blueshift and line width.\nBlue outliers only occur among the NLS1 galaxies of\nour sample (i.e., sources with high Eddington ratios and\nsmall Balmer line widths), but within the NLS1 population, blue outliers do not show a strong correlation with\nEddington ratio even though they preferentially avoid\nlow ratios. No correlation of outflow velocity with black\nhole mass, absolute magnitude, and with the width of\nthe broad component of H\u03b2 is found. Like in other samples, the number of objects is small, and larger samples\nof blue outliers are needed to confirm the weak trends.\nIt has occasionally been suggested that [OIII] in blue\noutliers appears broadened by orientation effects in the\nsense that we look face-on on the central engine, and into\nan outflow (Zamanov et al. 2002, Marziani et al. 2003,\nBoroson 2005). If that scenario is correct, we can use blue\noutliers as test-beds for orientation-dependent models of\nNLS1 galaxies which allow for the possibility that the\nH\u03b2 line of NLS1 galaxies is narrowed due to viewing angle effects. If, in blue outliers, the BLR was in a plane\n4 It is well possible that we have both, ionization and density\nstratification. In that case, the inner high-density clouds are also\nhighly ionized and/or matter-bounded, with little [OI] left.\n\n\f6\n\nKomossa et al.\n\nand if we viewed it face-on, blue outliers should have\nthe smallest H\u03b2 widths among NLS1 galaxies (here, we\ntemporarily classify NLS1 galaxies independently of their\nH\u03b2 width, but only use the ratios [OIII]/H\u03b2 and FeII/H\u03b2\nwhich still makes all of our blue outliers NLS1 galaxies:\nin all cases [OIII]/H\u03b2totl < 3, and FeII/H\u03b2totl > 0.5).\nHowever, we do not find any trend for small widths of\nthe broad Balmer lines among the objects of our sample\n(see Fig. 4).\nThe [OIII] lines of several objects still show the phenomenon of blue wings, arguing against the previous suggestion that the classical [OIII] emission in blue outliers\nis absent and we actually only see the blue wing. [However, occasionally, the presence of a strong blue wing\ncould mimic a blue outlier, if the wing is not spectroscopically resolved from the core of the line (e.g., Grandi\n1977, Holt et al. 2003)].\n4.3. Models of the narrow-line region\n\nThere is good evidence that the motion of NLR clouds\nis strongly influenced by the bulge gravitational potential\n(e.g., V\u00e9ron 1981, Whittle et al. 1992, Nelson & Whittle 1996; see the prev. Sect. 4.1). At the same time,\nthere is also evidence for radial motions in NLRs based\nfor instance on blue asymmetries of [OIII] profiles (e.g.,\nde Robertis & Osterbrock 1984, Veilleux 1991, Whittle\n1992, V\u00e9ron-Cetty et al. 2001), on correlations of blue\nwing blueshift with the Eddington ratio and other arguments (Xu et al. 2007), and on spatially resolved [OIII]\nvelocity shifts (e.g., Schulz 1990, Das et al. 2005). The\nexistence of [OIII] blue wings can formally be equally\nwell interpreted in terms of inflows or outflows, plus selective obscuration. Generally, there is a preference for\nthe outflow interpretation.\nRegarding theoretical models for outflows, a lot of\nwork has focussed on magnetocentrifugal winds and radiatively driven outflows from the accretion disk region\n(see K\u00f6nigl 2006, Everett 2007, Proga 2007 for reviews).\nThese models have successfully been applied to BAL\nflows and the BLR emission lines, are supported by recent observations (Young et al. 2007), and have recently\nbeen extended to spatial scales typical of the very inner NLR (Proga et al. 2008). However, little is known\nabout the formation or continuation of such winds on\nmuch larger scales on the order of 100 pc \u2013 kpc characteristic for NLRs. Mechanisms suggested to be relevant\nin the NLR (and CLR) include radiation pressure acting\non gas (Binette et al. 1997, Das et al. 2007) and on dust\ngrains embedded in the clouds (Binette 1998, Dopita et\nal. 2002), and the entrainment of NLR clouds in hot\nwinds (Krolik & Vrtilek 1984, Schiano 1986, Mathews &\nVeilleux 1989, Smith 1993, Everett & Murray 2007). The\npresence of collimated outflows of radio plasma in form\nof jets and their local interaction with NLR clouds has\nbeen observed directly (e.g., Falcke et al. 1998). Spatially resolved imaging spectroscopy of nearby AGN has\nproduced several good examples of spatial coincidences\nbetween radio jets and line blueshifts (e.g., Riffel et al.\n2006, Morganti et al. 2007), while in other cases the jetcloud interaction is very weak and does not significantly\naffect the local NLR velocity field (e.g., Cecil et al. 2002,\nDas et al. 2005). In some cases, jets are absent but\nemission lines are still blueshifted (Barbosa et al. 2008,\nin prep). In AGN with strong starburst activity winds\n\ncould also be starburst driven (e.g., Rupke et al. 2005).\nRegarding NLS1 galaxies, their high Eddington ratios\nmake the presence of radiation-pressure driven winds (on\nthe accretion disk scale) very likely. Less certain and\nunderstood is the efficiency of jet launching under highaccretion rate conditions. Again, these mechanisms refer\nto the innermost AGN region, not to larger scales. Blue\noutliers with their extreme velocity shifts place particularly tight constraints on models for AGN outflows on\nlarge, i.e. NLR, scales. We discuss several NLR models\nfor blue outliers in turn.\n4.3.1. A compact NLR ?\n\nZamanov et al. (2002) and Marziani et al. (2003)\nsuggested that blue outliers posses a very compact NLR,\nperhaps the result of the youth of these NLS1 galaxies\nwhich did not yet develop a full NLR. Their idea was\nbased on the assumption that blue outliers would only\nposses [OIII] emission and lack other narrow emission\nlines. However, we do find a classical NLR in terms of\nthe presence of low-ionization lines. Further, the fact\nthat their [SII] line widths put the blue outliers on the\nsame MBH \u2212 \u03c3 relation with BLS1 and normal galaxies\nstrongly indicates that their outer NLR is a quiescent\nclassical NLR similar to that of other BLS1 and NLS1\ngalaxies.\n4.3.2. A two-component NLR\n\nThe strong blueshifts we detect in the high-ionization\ncomponent raises the possibility that we see two independent components; a classical NLR, plus an independent outflow component which could be due to a disk\nwind, a wind from the torus or in form of a lowly ionized warm absorber. However, this interpretation is very\nunlikely, because the non-blueshifted [OIII] counterpart\nto the low-ionization lines, as it would be expected from\nthe inner part of a classical NLR, is weak or absent. This\nfact leads us almost inevitably to the third and fourth\npossibility.\n4.3.3. A classical NLR, modified at small radii\n\nThe fact that we do not detect a classical inner NLR,\nin form of a second, non-blueshifted [OIII] emission component, implies that processes directly modify/disturb at\nleast the inner NLR; perhaps in form of radio-jet \u2013 cloud\ninteraction. However, the strong dependence of emission\nline velocity shift on ionization potential that we detect\n(Fig. 3) indicates that we see a highly stratified, photoionized medium, not a local interaction due to shocks\nand locally disturbed velocity fields.\n4.3.4. NLR clouds entrained in a wind\n\nThe phenomenologically most straight-forward solution is one in which the (CLR and) NLR clouds themselves follow a decelerated outflow. This scenario requires\nan efficient driving mechanism and perhaps an efficient\ndeceleration mechanism. One possibility is direct acceleration of the NLR clouds by radiation pressure acting on\ngas or dust; another is the presence of a hot wind which\nentrains the NLR clouds (see Sect. 4.4). If the wind\nforms a decelerating outflow, the entrained clouds of the\nCLR/ inner NLR would have the highest outflow velocities, respectively, which would decrease in dependence of\n\n\f[OIII] blue outliers\ncore distance and would leave the outer, low-ionization\npart of the NLR unaffected.\nZamanov et al. (2002) reported a linkage of [OIII]\nblue-outlierness with broad-line CIV blueshift. Could the\nsame wind persist from the disk, to the high-ionization\nBLR [but leave the bulk of the BLR unaffected; by blowing perpendicular ?], and on to the CLR and inner NLR\n?\nIn this picture, the NLRs of BLS1 galaxies, NLS1s,\nand blue outliers would be intrinsically similar, and\nthe motion of NLR clouds generally dominated by the\nbulge gravitational potential. Which emission line regions partake in an outflow would depend on the efficiency/operating distance of the wind. It could be\npresent in all AGN, but would generally only affect the\nCLR (in AGN with blueshifted iron coronal lines but quiescent NLRs), or level off even before reaching the CLR.\n4.4. Mechanisms of cloud acceleration and entrainment\n\nWhile phenomenologically successful, the question is\nraised as to the origin of the wind/outflow on the one\nhand, and the entrainment mechanism and cloud stability against disruptive instabilities (Mathews & Veilleux\n1989, Schiano et al. 1995) on the other hand. We discuss\nseveral possibilities in turn.\nCloud acceleration by radiation pressure acting on dust -\n\nRadiation pressure acting on dust grains embedded in the\ngas clouds is an efficient way of cloud acceleration (e.g.,\nBinette 1998, Dopita et al. 2002, Fabian et al. 2006). In\nblue outliers, this mechanism is likely not at work, because we do not expect dust in the high-ionization BLR\n(we are assuming here that the high-ionization part of\nthe BLR partakes in the outflow, motivated by the results of Zamanov et al. (2002) described in Sect. 4.3.4).\nSome dust might be present in the CLR (even a small\nadmixture of dust would still lead to efficient radiative\nacceleration, and generally still predict sufficiently strong\ngas-phase iron lines; Binette 1998). While, observationally, dust-rich NLRs could be present in individual blue\noutliers (e.g., RXJ0135\u22120043), most of them have very\nblue optical continua arguing against the presence of an\nexcess of dusty gas along the line of sight. These arguments make cloud acceleration by radiation pressure\nacting on dust grains an unlikely scenario.\nCloud entrainment in collimated radio plasma - Outflowing radio plasma in form of jets is known to be present\nand to reach large distances from the nucleus in AGN,\nso could plausibly affect several emission-line regions on\nits way. The phenomenon of cloud entrainment in radio\nplasma has been directly observed and studied in starforming regions (Ostriker et al. 2001, Stojimirovic\u0300 et\nal. 2006). Jet-cloud interaction can result in a variety\nof phenomena, including cloud entrainment, jet deflection and disruption and cloud destruction (e.g., Saxton\net al. 2005, Krause 2007 and references therein). Of\ninterest here is entrainment (Blandford & K\u00f6nigl 1979,\nSchiano et al. 1995, Fedorenko et al. 1996). One key\nproblem is cloud longevity against various instabilities.\nFedorenko et al. (1996) argued for magnetic NLR confinement which would then allow for NLR cloud entrainment in radio jets.\nIndependent of theoretical considerations the question\n\n7\n\nis raised if the blue outliers of our sample all harbor powerful radio jets. Relatively little is known about the radio\nproperties of NLS1 galaxies in general. On average, they\ntend to be less radio-loud than BLS1 galaxies (Zhou et al.\n2006, Komossa et al. 2006) and share some similarities\nwith compact steep spectrum radio sources (Komossa et\nal. 2006). Four of the blue outliers of our sample have\nFIRST radio detections. These imply radio powers of\nP1.4 = 1022 \u20138 1023 W Hz\u22121 (Tab. 1) at 1.4 GHz; similar\nto those AGN which Nelson & Whittle (1996) find to be\noff-set from the MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relation. We do not have information on the radio morphology of the blue outliers.\nSources are unresolved with FIRST, with one remarkable\nexception: the radio emission of RXJ0135\u22120043 is extended by \u223c10 kpc (or double; see Appendix). Spatially\nresolved radio observations of the sources are required\nto search for the presence of jets and to study the radio\nproperties in more detail.\nThermal winds - Variants of thermal wind models have\nbeen studied in order to explain the kinematics of ionized absorbers (Chelouche & Netzer 2005), and of NLRs.\nIsothermal Parker wind models of Everett & Murray\n(2007), originally computed in order to model spatially\nresolved NLR velocity gradients of NGC 4151 (Das et al.\n2005), would have roughly the right properties to explain our average blue outlier velocity shifts and radial\nvelocity changes. A range in NLR cloud column densities\nwould lead to a spread in cloud velocities (see Eqn. (10)\nof Everett & Murray 2007), thereby perhaps explaining\nthe observed line broadening. However, as also shown\nby Everett & Murray (2007), realistic models including photoionization heating have temperature gradients,\nand adiabatic cooling decelerates the winds too quickly.\nAn extra heating source of unknown nature would be\nneeded in order to keep the wind isothermal. Models\nof Das et al. (2007), based on radiative acceleration of\nNLR clouds, implied that NLR clouds do not decelerate\nquickly enough in order to explain NLR velocity gradients of NGC 1068 observed with HST; models work after\nintroducing drag forces from an ambient medium. Detailed modeling of the present data would likely involve\nseveral of the above model ingredients. Such modelling\nis beyond the scope of this paper.\nHigh Eddington ratios and orientation effects - Common\nto blue outliers is their high Eddington ratios. Could\nhigh L/LEdd be the wind driving mechanism ? Additional orientation effects (as also discussed by Marziani\net al. 2003, Boroson 2005) are still needed in order to\nexplain why not all AGN with high L/LEdd are blue outliers. Near face-on orientation would have us look more\ndown the flow in blue outliers, thereby enhancing the\nstratification, broadening, and blueshift effect.\n4.5. Links with (compact) radio sources and mergers\n\nIt is interesting to point out similarities between the\nphenomenon of blue outliers in NLS1 galaxies and in\nradio galaxies (see also Holt et al. 2006). Several radio galaxies show a similar phenomenon of high [OIII]\ncore blueshifts and line broadening (e.g., Tadhunter et\nal. 2001, Marziani et al. 2003, Holt et al. 2006, Stockton et al. 2007; see Gupta et al. 2005 for a related\nphenomenon in the UV). Jet-cloud interaction in the (inner) NLR is the favored interpretation of most of these\n\n\f8\n\nKomossa et al.\n\nsources. These objects may represent the early stages of\nradio-source evolution (Tadhunter et al. 2001). Radio\ngalaxies with blue outliers in [OIII] are typically compact flat spectrum sources, are absorbed, and are luminous in the infrared. For some (e.g., PKS1549\u221279 and\nPKS0736+01) there is evidence that we have a near faceon view (Tadhunter et al. 2001, Marziani et al. 2003).\nAs pointed out before, the strong stratification we see in\nNLS1 blue outliers argues against local jet-cloud interactions in those galaxies, but would be consistent with\nNLR clouds entrained in the outflowing radio plasma.\nThe blue outliers among the radio galaxies show signs\nof recent mergers. Regarding NLS1 galaxies in general,\nthere is no evidence that the majority of them underwent recent mergers or has an excess of companion galaxies (Krongold et al. 2001, Ryan et al. 2007). Little is\nknown about the host galaxies of our blue outlier sample, in particular. IRAS11598-0112 indeed is a merger\nwith prominent tidal tails (Veilleux et al. 2002), ultraluminous in the infrared. Inspecting the SDSS images of the other galaxies of our sample we do not\nfind strongly disturbed galaxy images indicating ongoing mergers, but this needs to be confirmed with deeper\nimaging. One galaxy, RXJ0135\u22120043, shows indications\nof an off-center nucleus. That effect could be caused by\ninteraction, be mimicked by dust, or have another origin.\n4.6. Recoiled Black Holes ?\n\nRecent simulations of merging black holes predict black\nhole recoil velocities due to emission of gravitational wave\nradiation up to several thousand km s\u22121 (e.g., Campanelli et al. 2007; review by Pretorius 2007). Potentially,\nhigh relative outflow velocities of AGN emission line regions vs the host galaxy can arise if the recoiled black\nhole keeps its BLR and inner NLR (Bonning et al. 2007).\nApplied to blue outliers, if they harbored recoiled BHs,\ntheir whole BLR (plus the high-ionization NLR) should\nshow high blueshifts, while the 'remnant' NLR would still\nappear in low-ionization lines. In that case, we expect\nthe broad component of the Balmer lines to exhibit the\nhighest blueshifts of all emission lines; which is, however,\nnot observed. Shifts in broad H\u03b2 are less than those in\n[OIII].\n4.7. Future work\n\nThe SDSS data base is well suited for a systematic\nsearch for more blue outliers. Zhou et al. (2006) mention\nin passing the presence of several extreme ones among\ntheir NLS1 galaxy sample but do not discuss them further. Spatially resolved optical spectroscopy will allow\nus to measure directly line widths, outflow velocities, etc.\nin dependence of the core distance5 . Spectroscopy in the\nIR and UV will tell whether trends (a correlation with\nionization potential) persist in IR coronal lines and highionization UV broad lines. X-ray measurements of blue\noutliers will be useful to search for signs of high-velocity\nionized outflows, and to see whether blue outliers again\nstick out in AGN correlation space when adding their Xray properties (X-ray steepness, variability) to correlation analyses. (High-resolution) radio observations of all\ngalaxies will facilitate further comparison between blue\n5 This approach is difficult, however, if the near-pole-on interpretation of blue outliers is correct.\n\noutliers in radio galaxies and NLS1 galaxies and will tell\nwhether radio jets are present in NLS1 blue outliers. Radio observations have the potential to confirm the pole-on\nhypothesis of blue outliers, if relativistic beaming is detected. Imaging with HST will reveal whether the host\ngalaxies of blue outliers show signs of recent mergers.\nIn particular, galaxy merger simulations predict strong\noutflows in the final merger phase (e.g., Springel et al.\n2005). Imaging will allow us to test whether blue outliers\nare in such a phase.\nIf the face-on interpretation of blue outliers is correct,\nthey are also useful test-beds for the question, whether\nthe width of broad H\u03b2 is systematically affected by orientation. Increasing the sample size will allow us to test\nmore stringently whether the broad component of H\u03b2 is\nsystematically narrower in blue outliers. If so, this would\nimply that BLR clouds are arranged in a plane, and we\nwould underestimate systematically the BH masses in\nthese objects, and perhaps NLS1 galaxies in general. If,\ninstead, their BLR is spherical, we would not see systematically narrower H\u03b2 in objects viewed face-on, and\nwould not have to worry about correctness of BH mass\nestimates. Our preliminary results indicate that the latter is the case.\nOn the theoretical side, the question is raised as to\nwhich winds can operate across long distances spanning\nthe high-ionization BLR, CLR and a substantial part\nof the NLR, predict the observed gradient in cloud velocities (\u223c1000 km s\u22121 of high-ionization emission-line\nclouds close to the nucleus, and several hundred km s\u22121\nfurther out on typical NLR scales while the outer NLR is\nmostly unaffected), and ensure longevity of the emissionline clouds.\n5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn [OIII] blue outliers with their extreme velocity shifts\nthe effects of secondary influences on the NLR kinematics are enhanced or dominate completely. Their study is\ntherefore of great relevance for (1) scrutinizing the usefulness and limitations of [OIII] width as a proxy for stellar velocity dispersion; (2) understanding the origin and\ndynamics of the NLR; (3) investigating driving mechanisms of AGN outflows on large scales; and (4) examining possible links with results from merger simulations\nwhich predict that a substantial fraction of the ISM of\nthe merger should be outflowing. We have systematically\nstudied the optical properties of such AGN with high\n[OIII] blueshifts which deviate from the MBH \u2212 \u03c3[OIII]\nrelation of BLS1 and NLS1 galaxies, and obtained the\nfollowing results:\n\u2022 All of them have high Eddington ratios (L/Ledd=0.5\u2013\n1.5) and narrow BLR Balmer lines (FWHM(H\u03b2b )=1200\u2013\n1800 km s\u22121 ), which makes them NLS1 galaxies. The\nfraction of blue outliers among our NLS1 sample is 16%\n> 150 km s\u22121 ), and 5% at the highest outflow\n(v[OIII] \u223c\n> 250 km s\u22121 ). While blue outliers\nvelocities (v[OIII] \u223c\ndo enhance correlations which appear across the whole\nBLS1-NLS1 population, we do not find strong correlations of [OIII] outflow velocity with the Eddington ratio\nwithin the blue outlier population itself; perhaps due to\nthe small sample size.\n\u2022 We do detect a strong correlation between emissionline blueshift and ionization potential, and confirm a\n\n\f[OIII] blue outliers\nstrong correlation between [OIII] blueshift and [OIII] line\nwidth. The presence of a classical quiescent outer NLR is\nindicated by the existence of low ionization lines, by [SII]\nline widths which locate the blue outliers on the same\nMBH \u2212 \u03c3[SII] relation as other BLS1 and NLS1 galaxies, and by inferred NLR densities similar to other NLS1\ngalaxies. On the other hand, zero-blueshift [OIII] emission expected from a quiescent inner NLR is weak or\nabsent.\n\u2022 Taken together, these observations place tight constraints on models: We favor a scenario where NLR\nclouds of blue outliers are entrained in a decelerating\nwind. Similar, less powerful winds could be present in\nall AGN, but would generally only affect the CLR (in\nAGN with blueshifted iron coronal lines but quiescent\nNLRs), or level off even before reaching the CLR only\naffecting the high-ionization BLR.\n\u2022 The mechanism that drives and decelerates the wind\nis speculative at present, but could be linked to the high\nEddington ratios of the galaxies. Extra orientation effects (near pole-on views), considered previously to explain the correlation of [OIII] blueshift with line width\nof blue outliers, would also explain the strong ionization\nstratification we detect.\n\u2022 Two blue outliers have independent BH mass / stellar\nvelocity dispersion measurements and these place them\non or close to the MBH \u2212\u03c3 relation of non-active galaxies.\nThis, together with the fact that the width of broad H\u03b2\ndoes not correlate with [OIII] outflow velocity, indicates:\nIf blue outliers are indeed seen more face-on, this fact\ndoes not reflect strongly in their H\u03b2 widths, implying\nthat their BLR geometry is closer to spherical than to\nplanar.\n\u2022 Most remarkable among the blue outliers is the\ngalaxy RXJ01354\u22120043. Unlike other NLS1 galaxies its\nradio emission is extended and possibly double, its optical Balmer lines appear to be double-peaked, and its\noptical spectrum shows strong absorption lines from the\nhost galaxy. The link between blue outliers in NLS1\ngalaxies and in (compact) radio galaxies needs further\nexploration.\n6. APPENDIX: NOTES ON INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS\n\nA few sources are included in the SDSS-NLS1 samples\nof Williams et al. (2002) and Anderson et al. (2003).\nThe high [OIII] blueshifts of SDSSJ115533.50+010730.4\nand RXJ01354\u22120043 were reported by Bian et al.\n(2005).\nBoroson (2005) measured [OIII] blueshifts\nof NGC450#86, RXJ01354\u22120043, PG1244+026, and\nSDSS17184+5734. Here, we provide a short summary\nof the multi-wavelength properties of the blue outliers\ncollected from the literature, and give some comments\nbased on our optical spectral analysis. Galaxies are listed\nin order of decreasing [OIII] blueshift.\nSBS0919+515 - This AGN is a known X-ray source, first\ndetected with the Einstein observatory (Chanan et al.\n1981), mostly studied in the X-ray regime (e.g., Boller et\nal. 1996, Vaughan et al. 2001), and optically identified\nas NLS1 galaxy by Stephens (1989). It shows the highest\n[OIII] blueshift of our sample (v[OIII] = 430 km s\u22121 ).\n\n9\n\n1999) and was first classified as NLS1 galaxy by Williams\net al. (2002). It has the second-highest [OIII] velocity shift of our sample (v[OIII] = 330 km s\u22121 ), highly\nblueshifted [NeV], and faint coronal line emission of [FeX]\nwith a blueshift corresponding to v[FeX] \u2248 1000 km s\u22121 ,\namong the highest blueshifts reported for coronal lines\nto date.\nRXJ01354\u22120043 (SDSSJ013521.68\u2212004402.2) - This\nAGN was detected in the X-ray and radio band\n(Brinkmann et al. 2000, Wadadekar 2004) and was\noptically identified as NLS1 galaxy by Williams et al.\n(2002). It is remarkable in several respects. We find\nthat its optical spectrum appears to be dominated by\nthe host galaxy. Strong absorption lines from higher\norder Balmer lines, Ca H&K and NaID are detected\n(Fig. 5). The optical AGN continuum emission is either\nintrinsically weak, or absorbed (which would require a\npeculiar geometry of the absorber, given that the broad\nBalmer lines are present). RXJ01354\u22120043 is detected\nwith GALEX6 and displays red UV colors. Its (narrow)\nBalmer lines appear double-peaked, with a separation\nof \u223c580 km s\u22121 , or else are affected by residual, exceptionally strong and redshifted, host-galaxy features\nwhich is very unlikely, given the strength of H\u03b1. The\nline decomposition shown in Fig. 5 assumes the same\nwidths of the narrow core of H\u03b2 and of the two [NII]\nlines, fixed to the width of [SII], and further assumes a\nfixed [NII] line ratio. The remaining profile was modeled\nwith two Gaussians of free parameters and can be well\nfit with a broad component plus a second, redshifted\nrelatively narrow component. RXJ01354\u22120043 has a\nFIRST detection with a radio flux of 2 mJy and there\nis evidence for extended radio emission (Becker et al.\n19977), corresponding to a scale of \u223c10 kpc. This is\nremarkable because few if any NLS1 galaxies are known\nto have widely extended radio emission (Ulvestad et al\n1995, Komossa et al. 2006, Yuan et al. 2008). Inspecting\nthe FIRST image cut-out, the source appears to be\ndouble. Among the emission lines, only the Balmer lines\nappear double-peaked. RXJ01354\u22120043 is the first blue\noutlier to show this phenomenon. Explanations include\njet-cloud interaction, a bipolar outflow or, speculatively,\nsuperposed strong Balmer absorption (which is rarely\nseen because the required level population is not easy\nto achieve; Hall 2007, Lu et al. in prep.). We have used\nthe stellar absorption lines from the host galaxy for a\nmeasurement of \u03c3\u2217 . We obtain \u03c3\u2217 = 82 km s\u22121 which\nis in good agreement with the [SII]-based measurement,\n\u03c3[SII] = 106 km s\u22121 , and locates RXJ01354\u22120043 (almost perfectly) on the MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relation of non-active\ngalaxies (Fig. 1).\nNGC450#86 - Identified as NLS1 galaxy by Williams\net al. (2002) and detected in X-rays during the ROSAT\nall-sky survey (Voges et al. 1999).\nSDSSJ032606.75+011429.9 - A basically unknown\ngalaxy, with optical NLS1 spectrum (Williams et al.\n2002). No radio or X-ray detection was reported.\n6\n\nSDSSJ115533.50+010730.4 - This AGN was detected in\n\nX-rays during the ROSAT all-sky survey (Voges et al.\n\nhttp://galex.stsci.edu/GR2/\nmost\nrecent\ncatalogue\nhttp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?VIII/71\n7\n\nupdate\n\nat\n\n\f10\n\nKomossa et al.\n\nIRAS 11598\u22120112 - This galaxy is ultraluminous in the\ninfrared (Murphy et al. 1996, Kim & Sanders 1998) with\na single nucleus and prominent tidal tails (Veilleux et\nal. 2002). Its optical spectrum is that of a NLS1 galaxy\n(Moran et al. 1996). It is almost radio-loud with a 1.4\nGHz radio index R \u2248 5 (Komossa et al. 2006) and was\nfirst detected in X-rays with ROSAT (Voges et al. 1999).\nThe FeII emission in its optical spectrum is not well described by our FeII template. In particular, the 'red'\nand 'blue' complexes of FeII do not match each other\nwell, and the source redshift appears to differ from that\nof FeII. Strong emission of unknown nature remains blueward of [OIII]. Formally, we can describe it with an extra\n[OIII] component, broad (FWHM([OIII])=1800 km s\u22121 )\nand highly blueshifted (v=1300 km s\u22121 ). If real, it could\nrepresent an extreme blue wing, or could imply the presence of an extra starburst/shock-driven component. The\nstructure needs to be confirmed by independent spectroscopy.\nSDSSJ171828.99+573422.3 - Detected with ROSAT\n(Brinkmann et al. 1999), and optically identified as\nNLS1 by Williams et al. (2002).\nPG1244+026 - This AGN (Green et al. 1986) is a wellknown X-ray, UV, infrared and radio source (e.g., Elvis\net al. 1986, Kellerman et al. 1989, Sanders et al. 1989,\nFiore et al. 1998, Ballantyne et al. 2001, Jim\u00e8nez-Bail\u00f2n\net al. 2005) with an optical NLS1 spectrum (Miller et\nal. 1992, Veron-Cetty et al. 2001). It is radio quiet\nwith a 5 GHz radio index of R = 0.5 (Kellerman et al.\n1989). Hayashida (2000) and Czerny et al. (2001) determined its black hole mass based on X-ray variability\n(the power density spectrum). Czerny et al. (2001) report log MBH = 5.9 which is consistent with our value of\nlog MBH = 6.2 from applying the relation of Kaspi et al.\n(2005). We detect in its optical spectrum [FeX] emission\nwith an outflow velocity of 640 km s\u22121 .\nRXJ09132+3658 - Detected in X-rays with ROSAT (Voges et al. 1999, Brinkmann et al. 2000) and in the radio\nband during the FIRST survey (Becker et al. 1997), and\nidentified as NLS1 galaxy by Xu et al.

Left: The leftmost panel is based on \u03c3 measurements from the narrow core of [OIII]\u03bb5007 (asymmetric\nblue wings were removed). Blue outliers in [OIII] (with radial velocities larger than 150 km s\u22121 ) are marked with an open square.\nObject names are coded by number (1=SBS0919+515, 2=SDSSJ11555+0107, 3=RXJ01354\u22120043, 4=NGC 450#86, 5=SDSSJ03261+0114,\n6=IRAS11598\u22120112, 7=SDSSJ17184+5734, 8=PG1244+026, 9=RXJ09132+3658). The second panel shows the same relation based on\n[SII]. NLS1 and BLS1 galaxies follow the same MBH \u2212 \u03c3[SII] relation. The dashed and solid lines represent the MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relation of\nnon-active galaxies of Tremaine et al. (2002) and of Ferrarese & Ford (2005; FF05), respectively. Two objects with independent BH mass\n(PG1244+026) and stellar velocity dispersion (RXJ01354\u22120043) estimates are marked with special symbols (blue cross: PG1244+026,\ngreen asterisk: RXJ01354\u22120043). Right: Deviation \u2206\u03c3 of NLS1 and BLS1 galaxies from the MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relation of FF05 in dependence of\n[OIII] radial velocity, \u2206v, measured w.r.t. [SII].\n\n\f[OIII] blue outliers\n\n13\n\nFig. 2.- [OIII]4959,5007 emission-line region of all nine blue outliers (FeII and continuum subtracted). The expected [OIII] peak location\naccording to [SII] is marked with the dotted line. Our two-component Gaussian fit to each [OIII]5007 emission line is overplotted using a\ndashed line.\n\nFig. 3.- Velocity shift of individual emission lines versus the ionization potential IP and the critical density ncrit (left), and correlation\nof the [OIII] line width with the [OIII] blueshift (right).\n\n\f14\n\nKomossa et al.\n\nFig. 4.- Correlation of [OIII] outflow velocity with other emission-line and AGN properties (panels 1-7). Objects above the dashed line\nare blue outliers. NLS1 galaxies are represented by filled circles, BLS1 galaxies by open circles. The correlation coefficient rs shown in\neach panel was calculated among the NLS1 population only, or for the whole sample (marked as \"all:\" in the graphs). If the BLS1 galaxies\nare included, several correlations emerge, and the blue outliers amplify these trends. R5007 corresponds to the ratio of total [OIII] over\ntotal H\u03b2 emission, R4570 to the ratio of FeII4570 over total H\u03b2 emission. The last panel shows the galaxies' deviation \u2206\u03c3 (see text for\ndefinition) from the MBH \u2212 \u03c3\u2217 relation, in dependence of Eddington ratio. An apparent correlation does no longer exist once the blue\noutliers (marked with extra open squares) are removed.\n\n\f[OIII] blue outliers\n\n15\nH\n\nmodel combination\nRXJ01354-0043 (observed )\n\n100\n\n:\n\nobserved\n\n[NII]: [SII] profile\n\n100\n\nstarlight\n\nH\n\n:\n\nnarrow; [SII] profile\n\nH\n\n:\n\nbroad\n\nH\n\n:\n\nmedium\n\nmodel combination\n\npower-law continuum\nFeII templates\n\n50\n\ncm\n\n-1\n-2\n-1\n\n60\n\n0\n\nerg s\nflux (10\n\n-17\n\nA\n\n)\n\n80\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\nH\n\n: observed\n\nH\n\n: narrow; [SII] profile\n\nH\n\n: broad; H\n\nH\n\n: medium; H\n\nprofile\nprofile\n\nmodel combination\n\n0\n\n0\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\nrest-frame wavelength (A )\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n-1000 -2000 -3000\n\nvelocity (km/s )\n\nFig. 5.- Left: SDSS spectrum of RXJ0135\u22120043, and component decomposition into FeII complexes, a reddened AGN powerlaw\ncontinuum, and host galaxy contribution as labeled in the figure. Strong absorption lines from the host galaxy are visible. Right: Zoom\nonto the H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 lines, showing the presence of two narrow cores of each Balmer line (green and light blue; note that in this paper, we\nuse positive velocities to indicated blueshifts, negative values for redshifts), and a broad base (dark blue).
