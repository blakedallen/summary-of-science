In [2], some\naspects of the fermion determinant were examined, with results very similar to those in [3].\nHere we will study a rather fundamental aspect of the construction: the proposed emergence\nof a \"dynamical\" lattice spacing. CKKU make use of an N \u00d7 N lattice that contains link\nand site fields that are k \u00d7 k matrices. The classical lattice action contains many zero\naction configurations. CKKU expand the classical lattice action about a particular class of\nconfigurations (discussed below) that are characterized by a parameter a. For this reason\nwe will refer to such a configuration as an a-configuration. In the limit a \u2192 0, N \u2192\n\u221e, the classical action tends to the continuum action of (4,4) 2d U(k) super-Yang-Mills.\nThus a is interpreted as a lattice spacing. However, it is dynamical as it has to do with a\nparticular background configuration for the lattice fields. This strategy is based on the ideas\nof deconstruction [4, 5]. Studies where a partial latticization of 4d supersymmetric theories\nhas been obtained by this approach include [6, 7].\nIt is obvious that to arrive at the proposed continuum theory requires that a semi-classical\nexpansion about the a-configuration gives a good approximation to the behavior of the full\nlattice theory. But all a-configurations are energetically equivalent for any value of a. Furthermore, there exist other zero action configurations that do not fall into the a-configuration\nclass (shown below). For this reason, CKKU deform the action by adding an a-dependent potential that favors the a-configuration. The \"continuum limit\" then includes sending a \u2192 0\nin this potential. Although this deformation breaks the exact lattice supersymmetry, it is\nrendered harmless by scaling the relative strength of the deformation potential to zero in the\nthermodynamic limit. For this reason it has been argued by CKKU that the quantum continuum limit is nothing but the target theory, without the need for fine-tuning. For further\ndetails, we refer the reader to [1], as well as the articles leading up to it [8, 9].\nThe deconstruction method for latticizing a 2d continuum target theory does not require\nfermions or supersymmetry. The bosonic system (i.e., setting all lattice fermions to zero)\ncontained in the model of CKKU already has the interesting feature of a deconstructed\nlattice Yang-Mills. The same semi-classical arguments yield U(k) Yang-Mills with 4 adjoint\nscalars; that is, the bosonic part of (1.1). In the present article we will investigate the validity\n1\n\nThe (4,4) 2d U (k) super-Yang-Mills is best defined as the dimensional reduction of N = 1 6d U (k)\nsuper-Yang-Mills; the notation \"(4,4)\" denotes the number of left and right 2d chirality supercharges.\n\n1\n\n\fof the semi-classical argument. We will take into account quantum effects, estimating key\nexpectation values by means of Monte Carlo simulation. Of course we expect such results to\ndiffer from those that would be obtained in the related supersymmetric theory of CKKU; for\nin that case one would have dynamical fermions, and in the limit of vanishing deformation,\nsupersymmetric nonrenormalization theorems. However, we find it sufficiently interesting to\nanalyze the bosonic system as a preliminary step. Indeed, for the expectation values that\nwe study, we find that semi-classical arguments are not a good indicator of the full quantum\nbehavior.\nIn the next section we introduce the essential features of the bosonic part of the CKKU\nconstruction that will be needed for the subsequent discussion. In Section 3 we study the\nclassical minima of the undeformed and deformed actions. In Section 4 we outline the\nmethods and results of our lattice simulation. In Section 5 we suggest an interpretation of\nthese results in terms of the analysis of Section 3. In Section 6 we make some concluding\nremarks. In the Appendix, we provide a brief review of the N = 4 4d super-Yang-Mills\nmoduli space, which arises in the discussion of Section 3.\n\n2\n\nQuiver lattice Yang-Mills\n\nFor CKKU, the starting point is the Euclidean N = 1 6d U(kN 2 ) super-Yang-Mills. In our\ncase, the starting point will instead be Euclidean 6d U(kN 2 ) Yang-Mills. This is dimensionally reduced to 0d to obtain a U(kN 2 ) matrix model. The matrix model naturally possesses\nSO(6) Euclidean invariance. Next we note SO(6) \u2283 SO(2) \u00d7 SO(2) \u2283 ZN \u00d7 ZN . CKKU\nhave identified a homomorphic embedding of ZN \u00d7 ZN into the U(kN 2 ) gauge symmetry\n2\ngroup. Using this, a ZN \u00d7 ZN orbifold projection is performed to obtain a U(k)N 0d quiver,\nor, product group theory.2 In every respect we follow CKKU, except that we have set all\nfermions to zero. For details of the matrix model and orbifold projection, we refer the reader\nto [1]; in the interests of brevity, we will only give the final result, the undeformed lattice\naction:\nX \u00141 \u2020\n1\n\u2020\nS0 = 2 Tr\n(xn\u2212\u0131\u0302xn\u2212\u0131\u0302 \u2212 xn x\u2020n + yn\u2212\uf6be\u0302\nyn\u2212\uf6be\u0302 \u2212 yn yn\u2020 + zn\u2020 zn \u2212 zn zn\u2020 )2\ng\n2\nn\n\u2020\n+2(xn yn+\u0131\u0302 \u2212 yn xn+\uf6be\u0302)(yn+\u0131\u0302\nx\u2020n \u2212 x\u2020n+\uf6be\u0302yn\u2020 )\n\n\u2020\n+2(ynzn+\uf6be\u0302 \u2212 zn yn )(zn+\uf6be\u0302\nyn\u2020 \u2212 yn\u2020 zn\u2020 )\n\n\u2020\n+2(zn xn \u2212 xn zn+\u0131\u0302)(x\u2020n zn\u2020 \u2212 zn+\u0131\u0302\nx\u2020n )\n\ni\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere, xm , ym , zm are bosonic lattice fields that are k \u00d7 k unconstrained complex matrices;\nm = (m1 , m2 ) labels points on an N \u00d7 N lattice, and \u0131\u0302 = (1, 0), \uf6be\u0302 = (0, 1) are unit vectors.\n2\nThe U(k)N symmetry is nothing but the local U(k) symmetry of the lattice action S0 , with\nlink bosons xm in the \u0131\u0302 direction, link bosons ym in the \uf6be\u0302 direction, and sites bosons zm , all\n2\n\nQuiver theories were originally studied many years ago in other contexts [10, 11].\n\n2\n\n\ftransforming in the usual manner:\n\u2020\nxm \u2192 \u03b1m xm \u03b1m+\u0131\u0302\n,\n\n\u2020\nym \u2192 \u03b1m ym \u03b1m+\uf6be\u0302\n,\n\n\u2020\nzm \u2192 \u03b1m zm \u03b1m\n\n(2.2)\n\nCanonical mass dimension 1 is assigned to xm , ym , zm , whereas g has mass dimension 2.\nAlthough S0 is a lattice action that describes a statistical system with interesting features,\nit is not in any obvious way related to a 2d continuum field theory. As will be explained\nbelow, S0 \u2265 0 and a vast number of nontrivial solutions to S0 = 0 exist, not all of which are\ngauge equivalent. In fact, the space of minimum action configurations, or moduli space, is\na multi-dimensional noncompact manifold with various branches (classes of configurations).\nFor this reason it is difficult to say what a \"continuum limit\" might be; for there exists an\ninfinite number of energetically equivalent configurations about which to expand, not all of\nwhich are gauge equivalent.\nA surprising result-pointed out by CKKU, and based on ideas from deconstruction-is\nobtained if one expands about the a-configuration\n1\n1\nxm = \u221a 1, ym = \u221a 1, zm = 0, \u2200m\n(2.3)\na 2\na 2\nkeeping g2 = ga and L = Na fixed, treating a as small. (It is easy to see that S0 = 0 for\nthis configuration.) That is, we associate a with a lattice spacing (mass dimensions -1), even\nthough it arises originally from a specific background field configuration. In this case, one\nfinds that the classical continuum limit is nothing but the bosonic part of (1.1), which is a\nvariety of 2d U(k) Yang-Mills with adjoint scalars. In the case of the supersymmetric quiver\ntheory of CKKU, where fermions are present, one obtains (1.1) in full; i.e., (4,4) 2d U(k)\nsuper-Yang-Mills.\nThe trick is how to make the configuration (2.3) energetically preferred without destroying all of the pleasing symmetry properties of the theory. (This is particularly true in the\nsupersymmetric case.) In the quantum analysis, we must address the more delicate complication of entropy as well. CKKU suggest a deformation of the bosonic action in an effort to\nstabilize the theory near the a-configuration (2.3):\nS = S0 + SSB\n\"\u0012\n#\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132\n1\n1\n2\na2 \u03bc2 X\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\nTr\nxn xn \u2212 2 + ynyn \u2212 2 + 2 zn zn\nSSB =\n2g 2 n\n2a\n2a\na\n\n(2.4)\n(2.5)\n\nHere the strength of the deformation is determined by the quantity \u03bc, which has mass\ndimension 1. It is clear that the configuration (2.3) minimizes SSB . (Other configurations\nthat minimize S0 and SSB will be discussed below.) Unfortunately, in the supersymmetric\nversion of CKKU, the deformation SSB breaks the exact supersymmetry of their original\nlattice action (hence the subscript \"SB\"). For this reason they demand that the strength of\nSSB relative to S0 , conveyed by \u03bc2 , be scaled to zero in the thermodynamic limit. Thus we\nare mostly interested in the effects of the deformation subject to this scaling.\nIn much of what follows we will specialize to the case of U(2). This is merely because it\nis the simplest case and the most efficient to simulate. In this special case, xm , ym , zm will\nbe unconstrained 2 \u00d7 2 complex matrices.\n\n3\n\n\f3\n\nThe classical analysis\n\nHere details are given of the classical analysis of the minima of the action. In Section 3.1\nwe consider the undeformed action S0 ; then in Section 3.2 we consider the modifications\ninduced by the deformation SSB , which has the effect of lifting some directions in moduli\nspace. Through understanding this classical picture, naive expections of what will occur in\nthe quantum theory, based on energetics, can be formulated.\n\n3.1\n\nUndeformed theory\n\nHere we neglect SSB and examine the minima of S0 . Note that (2.1) is a sum of terms of\nthe form Tr AA\u2020 (the first line involves squares of hermitian matrices). Thus S0 \u2265 0 with\nS0 = 0 iff the following equations hold true:\n\u2020\nx\u2020n\u2212\u0131\u0302xn\u2212\u0131\u0302 \u2212 xn x\u2020n + yn\u2212\uf6be\u0302\nyn\u2212\uf6be\u0302 \u2212 yn yn\u2020 + [zn\u2020 , zn ] = 0\nxn yn+\u0131\u0302 \u2212 yn xn+\uf6be\u0302 = yn zn+\uf6be\u0302 \u2212 zn yn = zn xn \u2212 xn zn+\u0131\u0302 = 0\n\n(3.1)\n(3.2)\n\ntogether with the h.c. of (3.2). The set of solutions is the moduli space of the undeformed\ntheory.\n3.1.1\n\nZeromode branch\n\nTo begin a study of the moduli space, we isolate the zero momentum modes: xn \u2261 x \u2200n,\netc. Then Eqs. (3.1) and (3.2) reduce to\n[x\u2020 , x] + [y \u2020 , y] + [z \u2020 , z] = 0\n[x, y] = [y, z] = [z, x] = 0\n\n(3.3)\n\ntogether with the h.c. of the second line of (3.3). Eqs. (3.3) may be recognized as nothing\nbut the D-flatness and F-flatness constraints that describe the moduli space associated with\nthe classical scalar vacuum of N = 4 4d super-Yang-Mills.3 The equations are invariant with\nrespect to the global gauge transformation\nx \u2192 \u03b1x\u03b1\u2020 ,\n\ny \u2192 \u03b1y\u03b1\u2020,\n\nz \u2192 \u03b1z\u03b1\u2020\n\n(3.4)\n\nThen it is well-known that solutions to (3.3) consist of x, y, z that lie in a Cartan subalgebra\nof U(k); the proof is reviewed in Appendix A. The global gauge transformations (3.4) allow\none to change to a basis where this Cartan subalgebra has a diagonal realization. Thus one\ncan think of the moduli space as the set of all possible diagonal matrices x, y, z, and all\nglobal gauge transformations (3.4) of this set.\n3\n\nWe thank Erich Poppitz for pointing this out to us, as well as the branch of moduli space (3.6) given\nbelow.\n\n4\n\n\fIn particular, the zeromode moduli space of the undeformed U(2) theory is completely\ndescribed by\nx = x0 + x3 \u03c3 3 ,\n\ny = y0 + y3\u03c33,\n\nz = z0 + z3 \u03c33,\n\n(3.5)\n\nwith arbitrary complex numbers x0 , x3 , y 0, y 3 , z 0 , z 3 , together with U(2) transformations of\nthese solutions.\nEqs. (3.1) and (3.2) also have non-zeromode solutions. We do not attempt to present\nan exhaustive account of them. We will merely point out a few such branches in order\nto illustrate that the undeformed theory has a very complicated and large set of S0 = 0\nconfigurations. This observation will be relevant to our interpretation of the simulation\nresults in Section 5.\n3.1.2\n\nxm = ym = 0 non-zeromode branch\n\nWe have the very \"large\" branch of moduli space described by\nxm = ym = 0,\n\n0\n3 3\nzm = zm\n+ zm\n\u03c3 ,\n\n\u2200m\n\n(3.6)\n\n0\n3\nAgain, zm\n, zm\nare arbitrary complex numbers. Furthermore, zm is a site variable and thus\ntransforms independently at each site as\n\u2020\nzm \u2192 \u03b1m zm \u03b1m\n\n(3.7)\n\nIt can be seen that this branch affords a vast number of solutions to (3.1) and (3.2);\n0\n3\nthere are N 2 such solutions, modulo choices for zm\n, zm\n\u2208 C and gauge equivalences. We\nwill argue below that an understanding of the entropic effects that result from this branch is\nnecessary to understanding expectation values in the quantum theory-even when a potential\nis introduced which gives these configurations nonvanishing action.\n3.1.3\n\nzn = 0 non-zeromode branch\n\nAnother branch in moduli space is the following. First we set zn = 0, \u2200n, and introduce\nFourier space variables\nxn =\n\n1 X k*n\n\u03c9 fk ,\nN k\n\nyn =\n\n1 X k*n\n\u03c9 gk ,\nN k\n\n\u03c9 = exp(2\u03c0i/N)\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere k = (k1 , k2 ) and k1 , k2 \u2208 [0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1]. Then taking into account zn = 0, the\nconditions (3.1) and (3.2) are equivalent to:\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n\u2020\n\u2020\n0 =\n\u03c9 \u0131\u0302*lfk\u2020 fk\u2212l \u2212 fk fk+l\n+ \u03c9 \uf6be\u0302*lgk\u2020 gk\u2212l \u2212 gk gk+l\nk\n\n0 =\n\nX\nk\n\n\u03c9 \u2212\u0131\u0302*(l+k) fk g\u2212k\u2212l \u2212 \u03c9 \uf6be\u0302*k g\u2212k\u2212lfk\n\n5\n\n\u0001\n\n(3.9)\n\n\ffor all l = (l1 , l2 ) and l1 , l2 \u2208 [0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1]. Next we turn off all modes except one for\nboth fk and gk :\n(3.10)\n\ngk = \u03b4k,\u2212k\u2032 g\u2212k\u2032\n\nfk = \u03b4k,k\u2032 fk\u2032 ,\n\nHere and below, no sum over k\u2032 is implied. When substituted into (3.9), only 2 nontrivial\nconditions survive:\n\u2020\n0 = [fk\u2020\u2032 , fk\u2032 ] + [g\u2212k\n\u2032 , g\u2212k\u2032 ],\n\n\u2032\n\n0 = fk\u2032 g\u2212k\u2032 \u2212 \u03c9 (\u0131\u0302+\uf6be\u0302)*k g\u2212k\u2032 fk\u2032\n\n(3.11)\n\n\u2032\n\nFor the U(2) case, we find that solutions exist if \u03c9 (\u0131\u0302+\uf6be\u0302)*k = \u00b11. We already know from\n\u2032\nthe zeromode considerations that for \u03c9 (\u0131\u0302+\uf6be\u0302)*k = 1 we have solutions for fk\u2032 , g\u2212k\u2032 diagonal\n\u2032\nmatrices. In the case of \u03c9 (\u0131\u0302+\uf6be\u0302)*k = \u22121 it is easy to see that there are solutions, say, of the\nform\nfk\u2032 = zf \u03c3 3 ,\n\ng\u2212k\u2032 = zg (\u03c3 1 + b\u03c3 2 ),\n\nzf , zg \u2208 C,\n\nb\u2208R\n\n(3.12)\n\n\u2032\n\nThere are many values of k\u2032 for which \u03c9 (\u0131\u0302+\uf6be\u0302)*k = \u00b11. For N even these are\nk1\u2032 + k2\u2032 = 0,\n\nN\n3N\n, N,\n2\n2\n\n(3.13)\n\nFor N odd, k1\u2032 + k2\u2032 = 0, N are allowed and in the cases where\nk1\u2032 + k2\u2032 =\n\nN \u00b1 1 3(N \u00b1 1)\n,\n2\n2\n\n(3.14)\n\n(3.12) yield approximate solutions to (3.11), with an error of order 1/N. Thus in the N \u2192 \u221e\nlimit the number of S0 = 0 configurations in this class is vast; in fact, it is easy to check\nthat the number of such configurations is approximately 2N, modulo gauge equivalences and\nvarious choices for the constants in (3.12).\n\n3.2\n\nDeformed theory\n\nNow we consider the supersymmetry breaking deformation SSB introduced by CKKU. To see\nits effect it is handy to rewrite the quantities that appear in it. Recall that xm is a complex\n2 \u00d7 2 matrix. Dropping the subscript, we can always define\nx = x0 + xa \u03c3 a ,\n\nx\u2020 = x0 + xa \u03c3 a\n\n(3.15)\n\nThen it is straightforward to work out (\u03bc = 0, . . . , 3)\nxx\u2020 = x\u03bc x\u03bc + (x0 xc + x0 xc + ixa xb \u01ebabc )\u03c3 c \u2261 \u03c6x,0 + \u03c6x,c\u03c3 c \u2261 \u03c6x\n\n6\n\n(3.16)\n\n\fNote that \u03c6x,\u03bc are real, and that \u03c6x,0 is positive definite. With similar definitions for \u03c6y , \u03c6z ,\nthe CKKU deformation is\n\"\u0012\n#\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132\n1\n1\n2 z\na2 \u03bc2 X\nx\ny\nTr\n\u03c6m \u2212 2 + \u03c6m \u2212 2 + 2 \u03c6m\nSSB =\n2g 2 m\n2a\n2a\na\n\"\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n2\na2 \u03bc2 X\n1\n1\n2\nx,0\ny,0\n=\n\u03c6m \u2212 2 + \u03c6m \u2212 2\n+ 2 \u03c6z,0\n2\ng\n2a\n2a\na m\nm\n#\nX\u0002\n\u0003\nx,a 2\ny,a 2\n+\n(3.17)\n(\u03c6m ) + (\u03c6m )\na\n\ny,a\nz,0\nx,0\ny,0\nIt can be seen that the deformation drives \u03c6x,a\nm , \u03c6m , \u03c6m toward the origin, and \u03c6m , \u03c6m\nz,a\ntoward 1/2a2 . When \u03c6z,0\nm = 0, it is easy to see that \u03c6m = 0 identically.\nTo continue the analysis, it is convenient to rescale to dimensionless quantities using the\nparameter a:\n\n\u011d = ga2 ,\n\n\u03c6\u0302xm = a2 \u03c6xm ,\n\n\u03bc\u0302 = \u03bca,\n\nx\u0302m = axm ,\n\netc.\n\n(3.18)\n\nThen\nSSB\n\n\"\u0012\n#\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132\ni\nXh\n\u03bc\u03022 X\n1\n1\n2\ny,a 2\n= 2\n+ \u03c6\u0302y,0\n+ 2\u03c6\u0302z,0\n(\u03c6\u0302x,a\n(3.19)\n\u03c6\u0302x,0\nm +\nm ) + (\u03c6\u0302m )\nm \u2212\nm \u2212\n\u011d m\n2\n2\na\n\nFor any value of the lattice spacing a, the minimum of SSB is obtained iff\n1\ny,0\n\u03c6\u0302x,0\nm = \u03c6\u0302m = ,\n2\n\nx,a\ny,a\n\u03c6\u0302z,0\nm = \u03c6\u0302m = \u03c6\u0302m = 0,\n\n\u2200m\n\n(3.20)\n\nThe conditions involving xm are just\n1\n\u03bc\nx\u0302\u03bcm x\u0302m = ,\n2\n\nc\n\n0\n\nb\n\nx\u03020m x\u0302m + x\u0302m x\u0302cm + ix\u0302am x\u0302m \u01ebabc = 0\n\n(3.21)\n\nLet us examine what additional constraint this places on classical solutions to S = 0, beyond\nthe restrictions of the undeformed theory.\nFirst we note that neither of the non-zeromode branches discussed in Section 3.1 above\nare minima of SSB . Thus we pass on to the zeromode configurations (3.5). Eqs. (3.21) then\nimply that (3.5) is restricted to the form\n\u0001\nei\u03b3x\nx\u0302 = \u221a diag ei\u03c6x , e\u2212i\u03c6x\n2\n\n(3.22)\n\nand global gauge transformations of this. That is, x\u0302 is restricted to\u221abe an element of the\nmaximal abelian subgroup U(1)2 of U(2), up to an overall factor of 1/ 2. Similarly, we have\nfor \u0177,\n\u0001\nei\u03b3y\n\u0177 = \u221a diag ei\u03c6y , e\u2212i\u03c6y\n2\n7\n\n(3.23)\n\n\f\u03bc \u03bc\nFinally, \u03c6\u0302z,0\nm = 0 implies zm z m = 0, which has the unique solution zm = 0, \u2200m.\nApart from global obstructions that are essentially Polyakov loops in the \u0131\u0302 or \uf6be\u0302 directions,\nthe configuration (3.22) and (3.23) can be gauged away. It is straightforward to verify that\nthe required gauge transformation is (2.2) with\n\u0001\n\u03b1m1 ,m2 = ei(m1 \u03b3x +m2 \u03b3y ) \u00d7 diag ei(m1 \u03c6x +m2 \u03c6y ) , e\u2212i(m1 \u03c6x +m2 \u03c6y )\n(3.24)\n\nThis sets all x\u0302m , \u0177m to unity except at the \"boundaries\":\n\n\u0001\neiN \u03b3x\n\u221a diag eiN \u03c6x , e\u2212iN \u03c6x ,\n2\niN \u03b3y\n\u0001\ne\n= \u221a diag eiN \u03c6y , e\u2212iN \u03c6y ,\n2\n\nx\u0302N,m2 =\n\n\u2200m2\n\n\u0177m1 ,N\n\n\u2200m1\n\n(3.25)\n\nFor most purposes, we do not expect such vacua to distinguish themselves from the trivial\nvacua in the thermodynamic limit. In any case, global features such as these are typical of\nclassical vacua of other lattice Yang-Mills formulations, such as the Wilson action. In our\nsimulation study we will avoid this issue by restricting our attention to the expectation value\nof a quantity that is independent of these angles.\n\n4\n\nSimulation\n\nThe emergence of the effective lattice theory relies upon the assumption that fluctuations\nabout this classical minimum are small, and that the equations (3.20) are a good approximation to the corresponding expectation values in the quantum theory. For this reason we\nstudy\n\u001c\n\u001d\n1\n\u2020\nx,0\n\u03bc \u03bc\nTr (x\u0302m x\u0302m )\n(4.1)\nh\u03c6\u0302m i = hx\u0302m x\u0302m i =\n2\nin our simulations, and compare the expectation values to the classical prediction (3.20).\n\n4.1\n\nScaling\n\nWe study (4.1) along a naive scaling trajectory:\ng2 = a\u22121 \u011d(a) = fixed\n\n(4.2)\n\nThat is, we hold the bare coupling in physical units, g2 , fixed; this is equivalent to neglecting\nits anomalous dimension. The dimensionless bare coupling \u011d is then a function of a that\nvanishes linearly with a as the UV cutoff is removed.\nWith regard to \u03bc\u0302 we follow the instructions of CKKU: we send the dimensionless coefficient \u03bc\u0302 of the deformation SSB to zero as 1/N while increasing N.\n\u03bc\u0302\u22121 = cN,\n\nc = O(1)\n\n8\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fThis is equivalent to scaling \u03bc = 1/cL, where c is a constant and L = Na is the extent of\nthe system.\nIn the rescaled variables (3.18), the coefficient of the undeformed action is 1/\u011d 2 , whereas\nthe coefficient of the deformation is \u03bc\u03022 /\u011d 2 , as can be seen from (3.19). Thus it is that\nthe relative strength of the deformation vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, when (4.3) is\nimposed.\nWe perform these scalings for a sequence of decreasing values of a. That is, we study the\nthermodynamic limit for fixed values of a. We then extrapolate toward a = 0 to obtain the\ncontinuum limit.\nThe physical length scales are set by g2\u22121 and the system size L = Na. To keep discretization effects to a minimum we would like to take g2\u22121 \u226b a. Equivalently, \u011d \u22121 \u226b 1.\nOn the other hand we are most interested in what happens at large or infinite volume. To\nrender finite volume effects negligible would require g2\u22121 \u226a L. Equivalently, \u011d \u22121 \u226a N. In\nthe simulations we study the system for various choices of \u011d \u22121 and N. We extrapolate to\nthe regime 1 \u226a \u011d \u22121 \u226a N, but often violate the bounds 1 \u2264 \u011d \u22121 \u2264 N for specific points\nwhere measurements are taken. The reason for this is that data outside the optimal window\n1 \u226a \u011d \u22121 \u226a N is informative to the extrapolation.\n\n4.2\n\nSampling procedure\n\nWe update the system using a multi-hit Metropolis algorithm. We attempt to update a\nsingle site or link field 10 times before moving to the next, with an acceptance rate of\napproximately 50 percent for a single hit. We find that this minimizes autocorrelations while\nmaintaining program efficiency. We have examined autocorrelations and the dependence of\nour observables on initial conditions. These studies have led us to make 500 themalization\nsweeps after a random initialization, and 100 updating sweeps between each sample. 1/2 to\n2 percent standard errors result from accumulating 1000 samples at each data point.\n\n4.3\n\nResults\n\n\u22121\nIn Fig. 1 we show h\u03c6\u0302x,0\nm i [cf. (4.1)] as a function of N for various values of \u011d , having set\nc = 1 in (4.3). Doubling \u011d \u22121 is equated with halving the lattice spacing, according to (4.2).\nIt can be seen that h\u03c6\u0302x,0\nm i appears to tend toward smaller values as the lattice regulator\nis removed, contrary to the classical expectations (3.20). At large enough values of N the\ncurves flatten out to a constant value.\nTo understand this behavior, we first note that we are computing an expectation value\nthat is already nonvanishing in the undeformed theory (\u03bc \u2261 0). The undeformed theory\nexpectation values\n\u22121 x,0\nhg \u22121\u03c6x,0\nm i = h\u011d \u03c6\u0302m i\n\n(4.4)\n\nfor various values of N are shown in Fig. 2. The rescaling by g \u22121 = a2 \u011d \u22121 is useful because\nit corresponds to removing g from the undeformed action S0 by a rescaling of the lattice\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 1: Trajectories of fixed lattice spacing, increasing volume, with data connected by\nlines to guide the eye. Each line is marked by the corresponding value of \u011d \u22121. A doubling of\n\u011d \u22121 corresponds to a halving of the lattice spacing.\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 2: Undeformed theory results.\n\u221a\nvariables [cf. (2.1)]; this amounts to studying the undeformed theory in units of g. It\ncan be seen from Fig. 2 that this quantity is far from zero, and is rather insensitive to N.\n\u221a\n\u221a\nThe undeformed theory only contains two length scales, 1/ g and N/ g. For large N, it\nis not surprising that the local expectation value (4.4) is insensitive to this long distance\n\u221a\nscale. Rather, it is determined by the short distance scale 1/ g. The deformed theory\nretains this short distance scale. Once the system size is much larger than this scale, the\nlocal expectation value becomes independent of the system volume; this is particularly true\nbecause the relative strength of the deformation is being scaled away to zero [cf. (4.3)].\nIn Table 1 we show the large N expectation values (4.4) in the deformed theory as well\nas those of the undeformed theory. Here, the values for N = 16, 18, 20 were averaged for\neach \u011d \u22121 , which should provide a good estimate of the asymptotic value, as can be seen in\nFig. 1. The error was estimated based on the maximum deviation from this mean, among\nthe three data points, taking into account the 1\u03c3 error estimates that have been represented\nin the figure by error bars. Table 1 shows that the large N expectation values (4.4) in the\ndeformed theory are (up to statistical errors) the same as those of the undeformed theory.\n\n5\n\nInterpretation\n\nIn our simulations, we have observed that under the scaling (4.3), the deformation becomes\nineffective at changing the expectation value (4.4), or equivalently (4.1), away from the\nvalue that would be obtained in the undeformed theory. What has happened is that the flat\ndirections that were lifted by the deformation are becoming flat all over again as N \u2192 \u221e.\nMore precisely, the deformation is proportional to 1/g22L2 , and in the thermodynamic limit\nthis quantity vanishes.

By symmetry,\nthe same also holds for \u0177m .\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nNaturally we find our results disappointing. Attempts to formulate supersymmetric field\ntheories on the lattice have a long and troubled history (see for example [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]\n\n12\n\n\fand references therein). Recent success in non-gauge models is very encouraging [17, 18,\n19]. Of particular importance is the understanding of these models as \"topological\" or\nQ-exact, where Q is an exact supercharge of the lattice system [20, 21, 22]. Indeed, the\nCKKU undeformed action can be written in a Q-exact form. An exciting development\nhas been Sugino's exploitation of this Q-exact idea to constuct lattice super-Yang-Mills\nwith compact gauge fields and an ordinary (non-dynamical) lattice spacing [23]. While the\nSugino construction has its benefits, he notes (based on a remark by Y. Shamir) that these\nsystems also suffer from a vacuum degeneracy problem that renders the classical continuum\nlimit ambiguous. Consequently, Sugino has introduced a non-supersymmetric deformation\nin these models that lifts the unwanted vacua; he demands that the relative strength of this\ndeformation be scaled to zero in the thermodynamic limit. Thus in some respects the actions\nof Sugino suffer from a problem that is similar to that of CKKU. However, he argues that\nentropic effects do not destroy the vacuum selection imposed by his deformation. We are\ncurrently investigating this matter [24].\nHowever, we continue to find the constructions of CKKU intriguing. We would like\nto explore other possibilities for the deformation. In the non-supersymmetric case, we do\nnot see any compelling reason to scale the relative strength of the deformation to zero in\nthe thermodynamic limit. We are currently investigating whether or not a well-defined\ncontinuum limit can be obtained for the present system if this is not done. Furthermore,\nwe would like to better understand the phase structure of the deformed theory. Finally,\nit would be interesting to extend the present analysis to the supersymmetric system of\nCKKU, as well as higher dimensional systems. In the former case we expect supersymmetric\nnonrenormalization theorems to play a role in the behavior of expectation values as the\ndeformation is scaled away. In the latter case, spontaneous symmetry breaking is allowed-\nsince we do not face the theorems special to 2d [25, 26]; so a nontrivial phase structure may\nexist that would allow for a well-defined continuum limit.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank Erich Poppitz for comments, especially in regard to the\nmoduli space of the undeformed theory.

One way to see this is as follows [27].\nFirst we note that S0 reduced to the zero modes, which we write as Sz , takes the form\n\u0012\nN2\n1 \u2020\nSz =\nTr\n([x , x] + [y \u2020 , y] + [z \u2020 , z])2\n2\ng\n2\n\u0001\n+2[x, y][y \u2020, x\u2020 ] + 2[y, z][z \u2020 , y \u2020] + 2[z, x][x\u2020 , z \u2020 ]\n(A.1)\n\nNow note that the U(1) parts of x, y, z do not appear and can take any value. Thus we can\nrestrict our attention the the SU(k) parts, which we choose to express in terms of Hermitian\nmatrices ap , bp , p = 1, 2, 3:\nxc T c = (ac1 + ibc1 )T c = a1 + ib1\ny c T c = (ac2 + ibc2 )T c = a2 + ib2\nz c T c = (ac3 + ibc3 )T c = a3 + ib3\n\n(A.2)\n\nSubstitution into (A.1) and a bit of algebra yields\n\uf8ee\n!2\n2\nX\nX\nN\nSz = \u2212 2 Tr \uf8f02\n[ap , bp ] +\n([ap , bq ] + [bp , aq ])2\ng\np\np,q\n#\nX\n+\n([ap , aq ] \u2212 [bp , bq ])2\np,q\n2\n\n= \u2212\n\n\u0001\nN X\n2\n2\n2\nTr\n[a\n,\na\n]\n+\n[b\n,\nb\n]\n+\n2[a\n,\nb\n]\np\nq\np\nq\np\nq\ng 2 p,q\n\n(A.3)\n\nUsing positivity arguments quite similar to those above, one finds that Sz \u2265 0 and that\nSz = 0 iff\n[ap , aq ] = [bp , bq ] = [ap , bq ] = 0,\n\n\u2200p, q\n\n(A.4)\n\nwhich is nothing other than Eq. (53) of [27]. Since the matrices are all hermitian and they all\ncommute, it is obviously possible to choose a basis which simultaneously diagonalizes them.\nThis basis will be related to the one used in (A.2) according to T c \u2192 T \u2032c = \u03b1T c \u03b1\u2020 , which is\nnothing other than the global gauge transformations (3.4).\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
