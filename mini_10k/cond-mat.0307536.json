45\u2013051 Opole, Poland\u2217\n\nAbstract\n\n1.\n\nWe study the kinetics of confined carrier-phonon system in a quantum\ndot under fast optical driving and discuss the resulting limitations to\nfast coherent control over the quantum state in such systems.\n\nIntroduction\n\nUnlike natural atoms, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) always\nform part of a macroscopic crystal. The interaction with the quasicontinuum of lattice degrees of freedom (phonons) constitutes an inherent feature of these nanometer-size systems and cannot be neglected in\nany realistic modeling of QD properties, especially when the coherence of\nconfined carriers is of importance. The understanding of the decisive role\nplayed by the QD coupling to lattice modes has increased recently due to\nboth experimental and theoretical study (spectrum reconstruction [1\u20134],\nrelaxation [5\u201310], phonon replicas and phonon-assisted transitions [11\u2013\n16], phonon-induced pure dephasing upon ultrafast excitation [17\u201322]).\nThe phonon-induced decoherence seems to be crucial for any quantum\ninformation processing application and for any nanotechnological device\nrelying on quantum coherence of confined carriers [23, 24].\nThere are three major mechanisms of carrier-phonon interaction [25]:\n(1) Coulomb interaction with the lattice polarization induced by the relative shift of the positive and negative sub-lattices of the polar compound,\n\n\u2217 On\n\nleave from Odessa University, Ukraine\n\n\f2\ndescribed upon quantization by longitudinal optical (LO) phonons; (2)\ndeformation potential coupling describing the band shifts due to lattice\ncompression, i.e. longitudinal acoustical (LA) phonons; (3) Coulomb interaction with piezoelectric field generated by shear crystal deformation\n(transversal acoustical, TA, phonons). The lattermost effect is weak in\nInAs/GaAs systems but may be of more importance for the properties\ne.g. of GaN dots [26\u201328].\nDue to the carrier-phonon interaction, any change in the carrier subsystem must be accompanied by the appropriate modification of the\nlattice state. An example of this effect may be creation of the excitonpolaron states: excitons accompanied by the lattice polarization (coherent LO phonon field) with energy shifted down by a few meV [3, 22] .\nThe interaction with acoustical branches leads to creation of a similar\ndeformation field which, although much less pronounced in terms of energy shift, strongly influence the dynamical properties of the interacting\nsystem due to gapless spectrum and low characteristic frequencies of the\nacoustical phonons.\nThe lattice response to any manipulation performed on the charge\ndistribution confined in a QD leads to discrepancy between the desired\nstate of the quantum confined system and the actual one. This effect\nmay be stronger than any decoherence process in an undriven system.\nIn terms of the quantum information processing schemes, such a discrepancy is manifested by the loss of fidelity of the quantum operation.\nIn quantum nano-technology applications, it will reduce the efficiency of\nnano-devices.\nIn the present paper we discuss the carrier-lattice kinetics induced\nby optical excitation of a confined exciton. The paper is organized as\nfollows: In the next section we present the formal model of the exciton\nconfined in a QD. The section 1.3 describes the system kinetics in response to an abrupt change of the charge distribution. In the section\n1.4 we discuss the trade-off between the dynamically induced error and\nother processes limiting the coherence time of a quantum state. The\nfinal section contains concluding discussion.\n\n2.\n\nThe model\n\nWe consider the Hamiltonian describing a single exciton interacting\nwith phonons,\nH =\n\nX\n\n\u01ebn a\u2020n an +\n\nn\n\n1\n+\u221a\nN\n\nX\n\n\u03c9s,k b\u2020s,k bs,k\n\nk,s\n\nX\n\nk,n,n\u2032 ,s\n\n(s)\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nFn,n\u2032 (k)a\u2020n an\u2032 bs,k + b\u2020s,\u2212k ,\n\n\f3\n\nFast control in quantum dots\nElectron mass\nHole mass\nStatic dielectric constant\nEffective dielectric constant\nOptical phonon energy\nLongitudinal sound speed\nDeformation potential for electrons\nDeformation potential for holes\nUnit crystal cell volume\nLO phonon dispersion parameter\nTable 1.\n30]).\n\nme\nmh\n\u03b5s\n\u01eb\u0303\n\u03a90\nc\n\u03c3e\n\u03c3h\nv\n\u03b2\n\n0.067m0\n0.38m0\n13.2\n62.6\n36 meV\n5150 m/s\n6.7 eV\n\u22122.7 eV\n0.044 nm3\n0.03 meV*nm2\n\nThe material parameters used in the calculations (partly after Refs.

The coupling to LO phonons is much stronger than to LA\nphonons. In the case of LO phonons, the coupling strength increases for\nexcited states due to less charge cancellation between the electron and\nhole in these states (cf. Fig. 1b-d).\n\n3.\n\nSystem kinetics after an ultrafast pulse\n\nLet us study the kinetics of the system after an excitation performed\nby an extremely short (formally infinitely short) laser pulse. The information on the dynamics of the interacting carrier\u2013lattice system is\ncontained in the exciton single-particle causal Green function,\nGn,n\u2032 (t) = \u2212ihT {an (t)a\u2020n\u2032 (0)}i.\nThe averaging h. . .i is the temperature-dependent averaging with respect\nto phonon degrees of freedom and the vacuum of exciton (cf.

The first term in Eq. (9) describes the energy\ntransfer to the LO phonon sea, while the second one corresponds to the\nenergy transfer form gradually dressing exciton to the LA phonon sea.\nThe form of \u03b30 (\u03c9) for our model, including a few lowest states, obtained using the numerical wavefunctions is shown for various temperatures in Fig 2c,d.\nUsing (4), one finds\nImGn,n (\u03c9) =\n\n\u03b3n (\u03c9)\n.\n[\u03c9 \u2212 \u01ebn \u2212 \u2206n (\u03c9)]2 + \u03b3n2 (\u03c9)\n\n(10)\n\nIn the following, we will focus on the ground exciton state, n = 0. Usually, this state is long-living at low temperatures: the broadening of the\ncorresponding spectral line, related to radiative lifetime and thermally\nactivated processes, does not exceed 0.1 meV for T < 100 K [35, 17].\nLet us note that the term \u03b302 (\u03c9) in the denominator of (10) is important only near E0 , where the other term vanishes (otherwise, it is a\nhigher-order correction). Therefore, it may be approximated by a constant \u03b30 = \u03b30 (E0 ). In a similar manner, the correction \u22060 (\u03c9) may be\nreplaced by \u22060 (\u03c9) \u2248 \u22060 (E0 ) + (\u03c9 \u2212 E0 )(d\u22060 (\u03c9)/d\u03c9)\u03c9=E0 and combined\nwith \u01eb0 to give E0 , in accordance with (8).\nThus, one may write for I0 (\u03c9) = \u2212(1/\u03c0)ImG00 (\u03c9)\nI0 (\u03c9) =\n\n(11)\n\n\u03b30 /2\n1\n\u03c0 (\u03c9 \u2212 E0 )2 + \u03b302 /4\nX\n(ns,k + 1)\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 En \u2212 \u03c9s,k ) + ns,k \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 En + \u03c9s,k )\n(s)\n,\n|F0n (k)|2\n+\n(\u03c9 \u2212 E0 )2 + \u03b302\nn,s,k\n\nZ \u22121\n\n\f8\n*+,\n7\n6\n5\n3\n2\n\n$%&\n0\n\n!\"#\n\n1\n\n\u0083\u0084\n\n.\n\nIJK\n\\\n\n[\nZ\n\n`\n\n\u0097\n\u0094\u0095\u0096\n\u0087 \u0088\u0089 \u008a\u008b \u008c\u008d \u008e\u008f \u0090\u0091 \u0092\u0093\n\ngf\nc\n\n\u0081\u0082\n\n\u009c \u009d \u009e\u009f\n\n\u0086\n\n]^_\nr\n\n\u00b1\n\nFGH\nY\nX\n\n\u00ae \u0304\u00b0\n\nCDE\nW\nV\nU\n\n\u00a1 \u00a2\u00a3 \u00a4\u00a5 \u00a6\u00a7  \u0308\u00a9 a\u00ab \u00ac-\n\n@AB\nR\n\nS\n\ned\n\nab\n\n-\n\nT\n\n\u0098\u0099\u009a\u009b\n\n'()\n4\n\n/\n\n\u007f\u0080\n\n?\n8\n\n9: ;< =>\nL MNOPQ\n\nh\n\ni\n\nj\n\nk\nl\ns tuvw\n\nm\n\n~}\n\n{|\nz\nxy\nopq\n\nn\n\nFigure 3.

It\ncorresponds to a quasiparticle: the dressed exciton (i.e. the excitonpolaron, if neglecting LA phonons). For T > 0, this spectral density has\na Lorentzian shape around \u03c9 \u223c E0 , with width \u03b30 . Our model is unable\nto quantitatively account for the broadening found in experiment. In\nfact, to our knowledge, its origin has not been explained so far; we will\nuse the experimental values of \u03b30 corresponding to 630 ps and 170 ps\nexciton lifetime (including radiative porocesses and thermally induced\ntransitions) at T = 0 K and T = 25 K, respectively [17].\nApart from the central peak, the spectral density shows acoustic and\noptical phonon sidebands. To the former, only the ground state itself\ncontributes: the magnitude of the features visible in \u03b3(\u03c9) around excited\nstates (Fig. 2c,d) is much smaller than the energy distance between these\nstates. Therefore, as far as the interaction with acoustical phonons is\nconcerned, a single level (independent boson) model supplemented by\ncentral line broadening is very accurate.\n\n\fFast control in quantum dots\n\n9\n\nThe features resulting from the LO phonon branch behave in a different manner: the contribution from nonadiabatic coupling to excited\nstates is considerable. This results from the fact that the coupling to\nLO phonons is much stronger in general, the energies of LO phonons are\ncomparable to the exciton energy spacing and the coupling to excited\nlevels is stronger than to the ground state itself due to partial charge\ncancellation in the latter. In this case, the contribution from the higher\nstates dominates over the ground state contribution and the independent\nboson approach is not valid.\nThe time evolution of the dressing process is described by the inverse\nFourier transform of the correlation function given by (2). Taking into\naccount that for \u03c9 in the energy sector of exciton (of order of eV) \u03c9 \u226b\nkB T , one has\nZ\n1 \u221e\nd\u03c9ImGn,n (\u03c9)e\u2212i\u03c9t .\nIn (t) = \u2212\n\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nThe time-dependent correlation function may be obtained from (11),\nI0 (t) =\nZ \u22121 e\u2212i(E0 \u2212i\u03b30 /2)t \"\n#\n\u2212i(En +\u03c9s,k )t\n1 X (s)\nnk e\u2212i(En \u2212\u03c9s,k )t\n2 (nk + 1)e\n|F (k)|\n+\n,\n+\nN n,s,k 0n\n(\u2206En0 + \u03c9s,k )2 + \u03b302\n(\u2206En0 \u2212 \u03c9s,k )2 + \u03b302\nwhere \u2206En0 = En \u2212 E0 . The result, calculated numerically for various\ntemperatures, is plotted in Fig. 3b,d.\nThe smooth sidebands of I(\u03c9) correspond to the initial correlation\ndecay on 1 ps timescale. The LO phonon peaks lead to slowly decaying\nfast oscillations manifesting phonon beats with frequencies corresponding to the energy differences En \u2212 E0 \u2212 \u03a9. Without including anharmonic effects, these oscillations would decay very slowly due to the weak\nLO phonon dispersion. When the anharmonic phonon damping (corresponding to \u03c4LO = 9 ps decay of an LO phonon [36, 37]) is included\nby substituting \u03c9o,k \u2192 \u03c9o,k \u00b1 i\u03b3LO , the LO phonon beats decay with\ncharacteristic time slightly below \u03c4LO , which results from the joint effect\nof damping and dispersion. The long-time dynamics is governed by the\nLorentzian feature around \u03c9 = E0 and shows an exponential decay (as\nassumed beforehand).\n\n4.\n\nSystem response for finite-duration pulses\n\nIn the previous section we have shown that any change in the carrier\ndistribution in a QD is followed by lattice relaxation (dressing) processes\nwhich lead to some loss of the quantum coherence. To preserve the coherence while operating on the carrier states, the action must be adiabatic\n\n\f10\nwith respect to lattice timescales, i.e. phonon periods. Slowing down\nthe dynamics leads, however, to increasing effect of other decoherence\nmechanisms, like radiative recombination or thermally activated transitions to higher states, as the decoherence caused by such effects increases\nlinearly with time.\nIn order to study the interplay of these decoherence effects we have\nstudied the evolution of an exciton coupled to acoustic phonons under\noptical excitation by a finite-duration laser pulse [23]. The effect of\ncoupling to phonons was quantified in terms of the error of a coherent\noperation, \u03b4 = 1 \u2212 F , where the fidelity is defined as an overlap between\nthe actual state and the desired one (the latter was taken to be the\ndressed final state, obtained by adiabatic operation), F = h\u03c6|\u03c1|\u03c6i, where\n|\u03c6i is the ideal final state and \u03c1 is the final density matrix.\nThe density matrix for the final state is calculated using second order\nexpansion for the evolution operator of the total system and tracing over\nthe lattice degrees of freedom (see [23, 38] for details). For timescales\nrelevant here, it is sufficient to consider acoustic phonons and only one\n(ground) exciton state. The error averaged over initial states can be\nrepresented as the overlap of two functions\n\u03b4=\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9\nR(\u03c9)S(\u03c9),\n\u03c92\n\nwhere R(\u03c9) is the spectral density of the reservoir\nR(\u03c9) =\n\nX\nk\n\n[\u03b4(\u03c9k \u2212 \u03c9)(nk + 1) + \u03b4(\u03c9k + \u03c9)nk ] |F (k)|2 .\n\nThe function S(\u03c9) represents spectral characteristics of the system and\nis given by\n\u0010\n\n\u00112\n\n\u2212 1 \u03c4g2 \u03c9\u00b1 \u221a \u03b1\n1\n2\u03c0\u03c4g\nS(\u03c9) = (|F\u2212 (\u03c9)|2 + |F+ (\u03c9)|2 ), |F\u00b1 (\u03c9)|2 \u2248 \u03b12 e 2\n, (12)\n3\n2\n\u221a\n1\nfor a Gaussian driving pulse f (t) = \u03b1/( 2\u03c0\u03c4g )e\u2212 2 (t/\u03c4g ) , rotating the\nstate by the angle \u03b1 on the Bloch sphere.\n\u22121\nFor the coupling (1) to LA phonons, one finds at T = 0 for \u03c9 \u226a cl\u22a5\n\nR(\u03c9) \u2243 R0 \u03c9 3 , R0 =\n\n(\u03c3e \u2212 \u03c3h )2\n,\n16\u03c0 2 \u033ac5\n\n(13)\n\nand we obtain the averaged error \u03b4 = \u03b12 R0 \u03c4g\u22122 /3 (taking into account\nthe upper cut-off, the error will be finite even for an infinitely fast gate\n(see Fig. 4).\n\n\f11\n\nFast control in quantum dots\n\nHence, this non-Markovian error increases as the speed of gate increases. This could result in obtaining arbitrarily low error by choosing\nsuitably low speed of gates. However, if our system is also subjected to\nother type of noise this becomes impossible.

Combined Markovian and non-Markovian error for a \u03b1 = \u03c0/2 rotation on\na qubit implemented as a confined exciton in a InAs/GaAs quantum dot, for T = 0\n(solid lines) and T = 10 K (dashed lines), for two dot sizes (dot height is 20% of its\ndiameter). The Markovian decoherence times are inferred from the experimental data\n[17]. Inset: Spectral density of the phonon reservoir R(\u03c9) at these two temperatures\nand the gate profile S(\u03c9) for \u03b1 = \u03c0/2.\n\n\f12\nThe exact solution within the proposed model, taking into account the\ncut-off and anisotropy of the dot shape and allowing finite temperatures,\nis shown in Fig. 4. The size-dependent cut-off is reflected by a shift of\nthe optimal parameters for the two dot sizes: larger dots admit faster\ngates and lead to lower error. Interestingly, the trade-off becomes more\napparent at nonzero temperature.\nIt should be noted that these optimal times are longer than the limits\nimposed by level separation [39\u201343]. Thus, the non-Markovian reservoir\neffects (dressing) seem to be the essential limitation to the gate speed.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have shown that an action performed on the carrier system (e.g.\nexciton) confined in a quantum dot must be accompanied by an appropriate reconstruction of the lattice state. Such a dressing process takes\nplace spontaneously if the charge distribution is changed on times short\ncompared to timescales of the lattice dynamics (phonon oscillation periods). This spontaneous process destroys the quantum coherence of the\nsystem and may preclude quantum information processing or coherent\nnanotechnology applications.\nOn the other hand, sufficiently adiabatic operation would take long\ntime compared to the exciton lifetime and other exponential decay processes, again leading to large coherence loss. Therefore, optimal operating conditions for maximum preservation of coherence must be searched\nfor.\nWe have evaluated the minimal error for typical parameters, showing\nthat the optimal gating time (\u223c 1 ps) lies within the current experimental possibility. This optimal time sets up the limit beyond which further\ngate speed-up is unfavorable. It is remarkable that minimal error \u03b4 we\nfound (0.004 \u2212 0.01), although not extremely high, is still of 1-2 orders\nof magnitude higher than the one admitted by fault-tolerant schemes\nknown so far (\u223c 10\u22125 ). However, possible improvements of the latter\nschemes cannot be excluded.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Polish KBN under Grants No. 2\nP03B 024 24 and No. 2 P03B 085 25.\n\n\fReferences\n\n[1] S.
