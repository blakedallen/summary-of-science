Examples are numerous and range\nfrom Saturn's rings to powder processing. Being dissipative and therefore intrinsically far from thermal equilibrium, granular flows exhibit a plethora of pattern forming\ninstabilities [2, 3]. In spite of a surge of recent interest\nin granular flows, their quantitative modeling remains\nchallenging, and the pattern forming instabilities provide\nsensitive tests to the models. This work focuses on the\nsimple model of rapid granular flows, also referred to as\ngranular gases: large assemblies of inelastically colliding\nhard spheres [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In the simplest version\nof this model the only dissipative effect taken into account is a reduction in the relative normal velocity of\nthe two colliding particles, modeled by the coefficient of\nnormal restitution, see below. Under some additional assumptions a hydrodynamic description of granular gases\nbecomes possible. The Molecular Chaos assumption allows for a description in terms of the Boltzmann or Enskog equations, properly generalized to account for the\ninelasticity of particle collisions, followed by a systematic\nderivation of hydrodynamic equations [10, 11, 12]. For\ninhomogeneous (and/or unsteady) flows hydrodynamics\ndemands scale separation: the mean free path of the particles (respectively, the mean time between two consecutive collisions) must be much less than any characteristic\n\nlength (respectively, time) scale that the hydrodynamic\ntheory attempts to describe. The implications of these\nconditions can be usually seen only a posteriori, after\nthe hydrodynamic problem in question is solved, and the\nhydrodynamic length/time scales are determined. We\nwill restrict ourselves in this work to nearly elastic collisions and moderate gas densities where, based on previous studies, hydrodynamics is expected to be an accurate\nleading order theory [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. These assumptions\nallow for a detailed quantitative study (and prediction)\nof a variety of pattern formation phenomena in granular\ngases. One of these phenomena is the phase separation\ninstability, first predicted in Ref. [13] and further investigated in Refs. [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. This instability\narises already in a very simple, indeed prototypical setting: a monodisperse granular gas at zero gravity confined in a rectangular box, one of the walls of which is\na \"thermal\" wall. The basic state of this system is the\nstripe state. In the hydrodynamic language it represents\na laterally uniform stripe of increased particle density at\nthe wall opposite to the driving wall. The stripe state was\nobserved in experiment [20], and this and similar settings\nhave served for testing the validity of quantitative modeling [21, 22, 23]. It turns out that (i) within a \"spinodal\"\ninterval of area fractions and (ii) if the system is sufficiently wide in the lateral direction, the stripe state is\nunstable with respect to small density perturbations in\nthe lateral direction [13, 15, 16]. Within a broader \"bin-\n\n\f2\nodal\" (or coexistence) interval the stripe state is stable\nto small perturbations, but unstable to sufficiently large\nones [14, 19]. In both cases the stripe gives way, usually via a coarsening process, to coexistence of dense and\ndilute regions of the granulate (granular \"droplets\" and\n\"bubbles\") along the wall opposite to the driving wall\n[14, 17, 19]. This far-from-equilibrium phase separation\nphenomenon is strikingly similar to a gas-liquid transition as described by the classical van der Waals model,\nexcept for large fluctuations observed in a broad region of\naspect ratios around the instability threshold [18]. The\nlarge fluctuations have not yet received a theoretical explanation.\nThis work addresses a phase separation process in a\ndifferent geometry. We will deal here with an assembly\nof hard disks at zero gravity, colliding inelastically inside\na two-dimensional annulus. The interior wall of the annulus drives the granulate into a non-equilibrium steady\nstate with a (hydrodynamically) zero mean flow. Particle\ncollisions with the exterior wall are assumed elastic. The\nbasic steady state of this system, as predicted by hydrodynamics, is the annular state: an azimuthally symmetric state of increased particle density at the exterior wall.\nThe phase separation instability manifests itself here in\nthe appearance of dense clusters with broken azimuthal\nsymmetry along the exterior wall. Our main objectives\nare to characterize the instability and compute the phase\ndiagram by using granular hydrodynamics (or, more precisely, granular hydrostatics, see below) and event driven\nmolecular dynamics simulations. By focusing on the annular geometry, we hope to motivate experimental studies of the granular phase separation which may be advantageous in this geometry. The annular setting avoids\nlateral side walls (with an unnecessary/unaccounted for\nenergy loss of the particles). Furthermore, driving can\nbe implemented here by a rapid rotation of the (slightly\neccentric and possibly rough) interior circle.\nWe organized the paper as follows. Section II deals\nwith a hydrodynamic description of the annular state of\nthe gas. As we will be dealing only with states with a zero\nmean flow, we will call the respective equations hydrostatic. A marginal stability analysis predicts a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the annular state. We compute the marginal stability curves and compare them to\nthe borders of the spinodal (negative compressibility) interval of the system. In Section III we report event-driven\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations of this system and\ncompare the simulation results with the hydrostatic theory. In Section IV we discuss some modifications of the\nmodel, while Section V contains a summary of our results.\n\nII.\n\nPARTICLES IN AN ANNULUS AND\nGRANULAR HYDROSTATICS\n\nThe density equation. Let N hard disks of diameter d\nand mass m = 1 move, at zero gravity, inside an annulus\n\nof aspect ratio \u03a9 = Rext /Rint , where Rext is the exterior\nradius and Rint is the interior one. The disks undergo\ninelastic collisions with a constant coefficient of normal\nrestitution \u03bc. For simplicity, we neglect the rotational\ndegree of freedom of the particles. The (driving) interior\nwall is modeled by a thermal wall kept at temperature\nT0 , whereas particle collisions with the exterior wall are\nconsidered elastic. The energy transferred from the thermal wall to the granulate dissipates in the particle inelastic collisions, and we assume that the system reaches\na (non-equilibrium) steady state with a zero mean flow.\nWe restrict ourselves to the nearly elastic limit by assuming a restitution coefficient close to, but less than,\nunity: 1 \u2212 \u03bc \u226a 1. This allows us to safely use granular\nhydrodynamics [8]. For a zero mean flow steady state the\ncontinuity equation is obeyed trivially, while the momentum and energy equations yield two hydrostatic relations:\n\u2207 * q(r) + I = 0 , p = const ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere q is the local heat flux, I is the energy loss term due\nto inelastic collisions, and P = P (n, T ) is the gas pressure\nthat depends on the number density n(r) and granular\ntemperature T (r). We adopt the classical Fourier relation for the heat flux q(r) = \u2212\u03ba\u2207T (r) (where \u03ba is the\nthermal conductivity), omitting a density gradient term.\nIn the dilute limit this term was derived in Ref. [11].\nIt can be neglected in the nearly elastic limit which is\nassumed throughout this paper.\nThe momentum and energy balance equations read\n\u2207 * [\u03ba\u2207T (r)] = I , p = const ,\n\n(2)\n\nTo get a closed formulation, we need constitutive relations for p(n, T ), \u03ba(n, T ) and I(n, T ). We will employ\nthe widely used semi-empiric transport coefficients derived by Jenkins and Richman [24] for moderate densities:\n\"\n\u0012\n\u00132 #\n2dnT 1/2 G\u0303\n2\n9\u03c0\n\u03ba=\n1+\n,\n1+\n16\n\u03c0 1/2\n3G\u0303\n(3)\n8(1 \u2212 \u03bc)nT 3/2 G\u0303\n\u221a\nI=\n,\nd \u03c0\nand the equation of state first proposed by Carnahan and\nStarling [25]\np = nT (1 + 2G\u0303) ,\n\n(4)\n\n2\n2\nwhere G\u0303 = \u03bd(1 \u2212 7\u03bd\n16 )/(1 \u2212 \u03bd) and \u03bd = n \u03c0d /4 is the\nsolid fraction.

The simplest solution of the density\nequation (5) is azimuthally symmetric (\u03b8-independent):\nZ = z(r). Henceforth we refer to this basic state of the\nsystem as the annular state. It is determined by the\nfollowing equations:\n\u2032\n\n[rF (z)z \u2032 ] = r\u039bQ(z), z \u2032 (\u03a9) = 0, and\nZ \u03a9\nz \u22121 rdr = (\u03a92 \u2212 1)f /2 ,\n\n(9)\n\n1\n\nwhere the primes denote r-derivatives. In order to solve\nthe second order equation (9) numerically, one can prescribe the inverse density at the elastic wall z\u03a9 \u2261 z(\u03a9).\nCombined with the no-flux condition at r = \u03a9, this condition define a Cauchy problem for z(r) [16, 17].

For a given\n\u039b the annular state is stable above the respective curve and\nunstable below it, as indicated for \u039b = 104 . As \u039b increases the\nmarginal stability interval shrinks.

(9).\nAt fixed \u039b and \u03a9, there is a one-to-one relation between\nz\u03a9 and f . Therefore, an alternative parameterization of\nthe annular state is given by the scaled numbers z\u03a9 , \u039b,\nand \u03a9. The same is true for the marginal stability analysis performed in the next subsection.\nFigure 1 depicts an example of annular state that we\nfound numerically. One can see that the gas density increases with the radial coordinate, as expected from the\ntemperature decrease via inelastic losses, combined with\nthe constancy of the pressure throughout the system.\nThe hydrodynamic density profile agrees well with the\none found in our MD simulations, see below.\nPhase separation. Mathematically, phase separation\n\n\f4\n\nThis equation is complemented by the boundary conditions\n\u0393(1) = 0 and \u0393\u2032 (\u03a9) = 0 .\n\n(11)\n\nFor fixed values of the scaled parameters f , \u039b, and \u03a9,\nEqs. (10) and (11) determine a linear eigenvalue problem for k. Solving this eigenvalue problem numerically, one obtains the marginal stability hypersurface\nk = k(f, \u039b, \u03a9). For fixed \u039b and \u03a9, we obtain a marginal\nstability curve k = k(f ). Examples of such curves, for a\nfixed \u03a9 and three different \u039b are shown in Fig. 2. Each\nk = k(f ) curve has a maximum kmax , so that a density\nmodulation with the azimuthal wavenumber larger than\nkmax is stable. As expected, the instability interval is\nthe largest for the fundamental mode k = 1. The inset\nin Fig. 2 shows the dependence of kmax on \u039b1/2 . The\nstraight line shows that, at large \u039b, kmax \u221d \u039b1/2 , as in\nrectangular geometry [16].\nTwo-dimensional projections of the (f , \u039b, \u03a9)-phase\ndiagram at three different \u03a9 are shown in Fig. 3 for the\nfundamental mode. The annular state is unstable in the\nregion bounded by the marginal stability curve, and stable elsewhere. Therefore, the marginal stability analysis\npredicts loss of stability of the annular state within a finite interval of f , that is at fmin (\u039b, \u03a9) < f < fmax (\u039b, \u03a9).\nThe physical mechanism of this phase separation instability is the negative compressibility of the granular gas\nin the azimuthal direction, caused by the inelastic energy\nloss. To clarify this point, let us compute the pressure of\nthe annular state, given by Eq. (4). First we introduce\na rescaled pressure P = p/(nc T0 ) and, in view of the\npressure constancy in the annular state, compute it at\nthe thermal wall, where T = T0 is prescribed and z(1) is\nknown from our numerical solution for the annular state.\nWe obtain\nP (f, \u039b, \u03a9) =\n\n1 + 2G(z(1))\n.\nz(1)\n\n3\n0.8\n\n2.5\n-3\n\n10 \u039b\n\n0.6\n\n2\n-3\n\n10 \u039b\n\nmanifests itself in the existence of additional solutions\nto Eqs. (5)-(8) in some region of the parameter space f ,\n\u039b, and \u03a9. These additional solutions are not azimuthally\nsymmetric. Solving Eqs. (5)-(8) for fully two-dimensional\nsolutions is not easy [13]. One class of such solutions,\nhowever, bifurcate continuously from the annular state,\nso they can be found by linearizing Eq. (5), as in rectangular geometry [13, 16]. In the framework of a timedependent hydrodynamic formulation, this analysis corresponds to a marginal stability analysis which involves a\nsmall perturbation to the annular state. For a single azimuthal mode \u223c sin(k\u03b8) (where k is integer) we can write\nZ(r, \u03b8) = z(r) + \u03b5 \u039e(r) sin(k\u03b8), where \u039e(r) is a smooth\nfunction, and \u03b5 \u226a 1 a small parameter. Substituting this\ninto Eq. (5) and linearizing the resulting equation yields\na k-dependent second order differential equation for the\nfunction \u0393(r) \u2261 F [Z(r)] \u039e(r):\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n1 \u2032\n\u039bQ\u2032 (Z)\nk\n\u2032\u2032\n\u0393k + \u0393k \u2212\n\u0393k = 0 .\n(10)\n+\nr\nr2\nF (Z)\n\n0.4\n\n1.5\n\n0.2\n0\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n2\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nf (\u03a9 \u22121)/2\n\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nf (\u03a9 \u22121)/2\nFIG. 3: Two-dimensional projections on the [\u039b, f (\u03a92 \u2212 1)/2]\nplane of the phase diagram at \u03a9 = 1.5 (the solid line), \u03a9 = 3\n(the dotted line), and \u03a9 = 5 (the dashed line). The inset\nshows more clearly, for \u03a9 = 3, that the marginal stability\ncurve (the solid line) lies within the negative compressibility\nregion (bounded by the dashed line).\n\nThe spinodal (negative compressibility) region is determined by the necessary condition for the instability:\n(\u2202P/\u2202f )\u039b,\u03a9 < 0, whereas the borders of the spinodal\nregion are defined by (\u2202P/\u2202f )\u039b,\u03a9 = 0. Typical P (f )\ncurves for a fixed \u03a9 and several different \u039b are shown\nin Fig. 4. One can see that, at sufficiently large \u039b, the\nrescaled pressure P goes down with an increase of f at\nan interval f1 < f < f2 . That is, the effective compressibility of the gas with respect to a redistribution of the\nmaterial in the azimuthal direction is negative on this\ninterval of area fractions. By joining the spinodal points\nf1 and (separately) f2 at different \u039b, we can draw the\nspinodal line for a fixed \u03a9. As \u039b goes down, the spinodal interval shrinks and eventually becomes a point at\na critical point (Pc , fc ), or (\u039bc , fc ) (where all the critical\nvalues are \u03a9-dependent). For \u039b < \u039bc P (f ) monotonically increases and there is no instability.\nWhat is the relation between the spinodal interval\n(f1 , f2 ) and the marginal stability interval (fmin , fmax )?\nThese intervals would coincide were the azimuthal wavelength of the perturbation infinite (or, equivalently, k \u2192\n0), so that the azimuthal heat conduction would vanish. Of course, this is not possible in annular geometry,\nwhere k \u2265 1. As a result, the negative compressibility\ninterval must include in itself the marginal stability interval (fmin , fmax ). This is what our calculations indeed\nshow, see the inset of Fig. 3. That is, a negative compressibility is necessary, but not sufficient, for instability,\nsimilarly to what was found in rectangular geometry [16].\nImportantly, the instability region of the parameter\nspace is by no means not the whole region the region\nwhere phase separation is expected to occur. Indeed,\nin analogy to what happens in rectangular geometry\n[14, 19], phase separation is also expected in a binodal (or\ncoexistence) region of the area fractions, where the annular state is stable to small perturbations, but unstable to\n\n\f5\n\u039b=1.1 \u00d7 10\n\n(Pc , fc)\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n\u039b=1.5 \u00d7 10\n\n2\n\n10 P\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\u039b=3.5 \u00d7 10\n\nFIG. 5: Typical steady state snapshots for N = 1250 and\n\u03a9 = 6 (a); N = 5267 and \u03a9 = 3 (b), and N = 6320 and\n\u03a9 = 6 (c).

The whole region of phase separation should be larger than the instability region, and it\nshould of course include the instability region. Though\nwe did not attempt to determine the binodal region of\nthe system from the hydrostatic equations (this task has\nnot been accomplished yet even for rectangular geometry,\nexcept in the close vicinity of the critical point [19]), we\ndetermined the binodal region from our MD simulations\nreported in the next section.\nIII.\n\nMD SIMULATIONS\n\nMethod. We performed a series of event-driven MD\nsimulations of this system using an algorithm described\nby P\u00f6schel and Schwager [26]. Simulations involved N\nhard disks of diameter d = 1 and mass m = 1. After\neach collision of particle i with particle j, their relative\nvelocity is updated according to\n~vij\u2032 = ~vij \u2212 (1 + \u03bc) (~vij * r\u0302ij ) r\u0302ij ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere ~vij is the precollisional relative velocity, and r\u0302ij \u2261\n~rij / |~rij | is a unit vector connecting the centers of the\ntwo particles. Particle collisions with the exterior wall\nr = Rext are assumed elastic. The interior wall is kept at\nconstant temperature T0 that we set to unity. This is implemented as follows. When a particle collides with the\nwall it forgets its velocity and picks up a new one from a\nproper Maxwellian distribution with temperature T0 , see\ne.g. Ref. [26], pages 173-177, for detail. The time scale is\ntherefore d(m/T0 )1/2 = 1. The initial condition is a uniform distribution of non-overlapping particles inside the\nannular box. Their initial velocities are taken randomly\n\nfrom a Maxwellian distribution at temperature T0 = 1.\nIn all simulations the coefficient of normal restitution\n\u03bc = 0.92 and the interior radius Rint /d = 22.0 were fixed,\nwhereas the the number of particles 527 \u2264 N \u2264 7800 and\nthe aspect ratio 1.5 \u2264 \u03a9 \u2264 6 were varied. In terms of\nthe three scaled hydrodynamic parameters the heat loss\nparameter \u039b = 81.09 was fixed whereas f and \u03a9 varied.\nTo compare the simulation results with predictions\nof our hydrostatic theory, all the measurements were\nperformed once the system reached a steady state. This\nwas monitored by the evolution of the total kinetic\nPN\nenergy (1/2) i=1 ~vi2 , which first decays and then, on\nthe average, stays constant.\nSteady States. Typical steady state snapshots of the\nsystem, observed in our MD simulation, are displayed\nin Fig. 5. Panel (a) shows a dilute state where the radial density inhomogeneity, though actually present, is\nnot visible by naked eye. Panels (b) and (c) do exhibit\na pronounced radial density inhomogeneity. Apart from\nvisible density fluctuations, panels (a) and (b) correspond\nto annular states. Panel (c) depicts a broken-symmetry\n(phase separated) state. When an annular state is observed, its density profile agrees well with the solution of\nthe hydrostatic equations (5)-(8). A typical example of\nsuch a comparison is shown in Fig. 1.\nLet us fix the aspect ratio \u03a9 of the annulus at not\ntoo a small value and vary the number of particles N .\nFirst, what happens on a qualitative level? The simulations show that, at small N , dilute annular states, similar\nto snapshot (a) in Fig. 5, are observed. As N increases,\nbroken-symmetric states start to appear. Well within the\nunstable region, found from hydrodynamics, a high density cluster appears, like the one shown in Fig. 5c, and\nperforms an erratic motion along the exterior wall. As N\nis increased still further, well beyond the high-f branch\nof the unstable region, an annular state reappears, as in\nFig. 5b. This time, however, the annular state is denser,\nwhile its local structure varies from a solid-like (with imperfections such as voids and line defects) to a liquid-like.\nTo characterize the spatio-temporal behavior of the\ngranulate at a steady state, we followed the position of\nthe center of mass (COM) of the granulate. Several examples of the COM trajectories are displayed in Fig. 6.\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 6: Typical steady state snapshots (the left column) and\nthe temporal evolution of the COM (the middle column) and\nof the squared amplitude of the fundamental Fourier mode\n(the right column). The temporal data are sampled each 150\ncollisions per particle. Each row corresponds to one simulation with the indicated parameters. The vertical scale of\npanels a and b was stretched for clarity.\n\nHere cases (a) and (b) correspond, in the hydrodynamic\nlanguage, to annular states. There are, however, significant fluctuations of the COM around the center of the\nannulus. These fluctuations are of course not accounted\nfor by hydrodynamic theory. In case (b), where the dense\ncluster develops, the fluctuations are much weaker that\nin case (a). More interesting are cases (c) and (d). They\ncorrespond to broken-symmetry states: well within the\nphase separation region of the parameter space (case\nc) and close to the phase separation border (case d).\nThe COM trajectory in case (c) shows that the granular \"droplet\" performs random motion in the azimuthal\ndirection, staying close to the exterior wall. This is in\ncontrast with case (d), where fluctuations are strong both\nin the azimuthal and in the radial directions. Following\nthe actual snapshots of the simulation, one observes here\na very complicated motion of the \"droplet\", as well as its\ndissolution into more \"droplets\", mergers of the droplets\netc. Therefore, as in the case of granular phase separation in rectangular geometry [18], the granular phase\nseparation in annular geometry is accompanied by considerable spatio-temporal fluctuations. In this situation\na clear distinction between a phase-separated state and\n\nFIG.\nnormalized probability distribution functions\n` 7: The\n \u0301\nP1 A21 /a20 for \u03a9 = 3 (the left column) and \u03a9 = 5 (the right\ncolumn) for different numbers of particles.\n\nan annular state, and a comparison between the MD simulations and hydrodynamic theory, demand proper diagnostics. We found that such diagnostics are provided by\nthe azimuthal spectrum of the particle density and its\nprobability distribution.\nAzimuthal Density Spectrum. Let us consider the\n(time-dependent) rescaled density field \u03bd(r, \u03b8, t) =\nn(r, \u03b8, t)/nc (where r is rescaled to the interior wall radius\nas before), and introduce the integrated field \u03bd\u0302(\u03b8, t):\n\u03bd\u0302(\u03b8, t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u03bd(r, \u03b8, t) r dr .\n\n(13)\n\n1\n\nIn a system of N particles, \u03bd\u0302(\u03b8, t) is normalized so that\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03bd\u0302(\u03b8, t) d\u03b8 =\n\nN\n2 .\nnc Rint\n\n(14)\n\nBecause of the periodicity in \u03b8 the function \u03bd\u0302(\u03b8, t) can be\n\n\f7\nTABLE I: The averaged squared relative amplitudes\nhA2k (t)i/a20 for the first three modes k = 1, 2 and 3.

As is shown in\nTable I, A21 (t) is usually much larger (on the average)\nthat the rest of A2k (t). Therefore, the quantity A21 (t)/a20\nis sufficient for our purposes.\nOnce the system relaxed to a steady state, we followed\nthe temporal evolution of the quantity A21 /a20 . Typical\nresults are shown in the right column of Fig. 6. One\nobserves that, for annular states, this quantity is usually small, as is the cases (a) and (b) in Fig. 6. For\nbroken-symmetry states A21 is larger, and it increases as\none moves deeper into the phase separation region. (Notice that in Fig. 6 the averaged value of A21 /a20 in (c)\nis larger than in (d), which means that (c) is deeper in\nthe phase separation region.) Another characteristics of\nA21 (t)/a20 is the magnitude of fluctuations. One can notice that, in the vicinity of the phase separation border\nthe fluctuations are stronger (as in case (d) in Fig. 6).\nAll these properties are encoded in the probability dis2\ntribution P1 of the values of (A1 /a0 ) : the ultimate tool\nof our diagnostics. Figure 7 shows two series of measurements of this quantity at different N : for \u03a9 = 3 and\n\u03a9 = 5. By following the position of the maximum of\nP1 we were able to to sharply discriminate between the\nannular states and phase separated states and therefore\nto locate the phase separation border. When the max2\nimum of P1 occurs at the zero value of (A1 /a0 ) (as in\ncases (a) and (d) and, respectively, (e) and (h) in Fig. 7),\nan annular state is observed. On the contrary, when the\n2\nmaximum of P1 occurs at a non-zero value of (A1 /a0 )\n(as in cases (b) and (c) and, respectively, (f) and (g)\nin Fig. 7), a phase separated state is observed. In each\ncase, the width of the probability distribution (measured,\nfor example, at the half-maximum) yields a direct measure of the magnitude of fluctuations.

A marginal\nstability analysis yields a region of the parameter space\nwhere the annular state \u2013 the basic, azimuthally symmetric steady state of the system \u2013 is unstable with respect to small perturbations which break the azimuthal\nsymmetry. The physics behind the instability is negative\neffective compressibility of the gas in the azimuthal direction, which results from the inelastic energy loss. MD\nsimulations of this system show phase separation, but\nit is masked by large spatio-temporal fluctuations. By\nmeasuring the probability distribution of the amplitude\nof the fundamental Fourier mode of the azimuthal spectrum of the particle density we have been able to clearly\nidentify the transition to phase separated states in the\nMD simulations. We have found that the instability region of the parameter space, predicted from hydrostatics,\nis located within the phase separation region observed\nin the MD simulations. This implies the presence of a\nbinodal (coexistence) region, where the annular state is\nmetastable, similar to what was found in rectangular geometry [14, 19]. The instability persists in an alternative\nsetting (a driving exterior wall and an elastic interior\nwall), and also when the elastic wall is replaced by a\nweakly inelastic one. We hope our results will stimulate\nexperimental work on the phase separation instability.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nis elastic. The corresponding hydrostatic problem is determined by the same three scaled parameters f , \u039b and\n\u03a9, but the boundary conditions must be changed accordingly. Here azimuthally symmetric clusters appear near\nthe (elastic) interior wall. Symmetry breaking instability occurs here as well. We found very similar marginal\nstability curves here, but they are narrower (as shown in\nFig. 9) than those obtained for the original setting.\nFinally, we returned to our original setting and performed several MD simulations, replacing the perfectly\nelastic exterior wall by a weakly inelastic one. The inelastic particle collisions with the exterior wall were modeled in the same way as the inelastic collisions between\nparticles. Typical results of these simulations are shown\n\nThis work grew out of a student research project at\nthe 2003 Summer School \"From pattern formation to\ngranular physics and soft condensed matter\" sponsored\nby the European Union under FP5 High Level Scientific\nConferences, and by the NATO Advanced Study Institute.
