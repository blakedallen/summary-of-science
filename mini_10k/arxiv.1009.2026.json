Ab initio\ncalculations show that zigzag GNRs are magnetic8,9 and\nthey become half metallic by breaking the symmetry between the left and right edges.9\u201311 This can be achieved\nby using a different chemical termination at each edge,9,10\nor by applying an external electric field.11\nTransport properties of GNRs depend on its edge\ndisorder.4 At present, controlling the shape and width\nof the GNR is a very challenging experimental task.4,5\nThere are also experimental evidences, corroborated by\nab initio calculations, that the zigzag edge is metastable\nin vacuum because it shows a planar reconstruction to\nlower its energy.12 A new possibility for the fabrication\nof high-quality graphene nanoribbons is by selectively hydrogenating graphene or by carving GNRs on a graphane\nsheet.13\nFirst-principles calculations predicted that graphane\nis a wide-gap insulator.14,15 This novel material\nwas synthesized recently by exposing graphene to a\ncold hydrogen plasma.16 The promising properties of\ngraphene/graphane structures have attracted recently\na large interest.13,17\u201319 It was shown that the energy\n\nbandgaps of both zigzag and armchair graphane nanoribbons increase as the nanoribbons become narrower.17,18\nHybrid graphene/graphane nanoribbons in vacuum\nwhere also studied from ab initio calculations and it\nwas shown that the energy bandgap is dominated by the\ngraphene section of the nanoribbon.18 A bandgap opening in graphene, induced by the patterned absorption of\natomic hydrogen onto the Moir\u00e9 superlattice positions\nof graphene grown on a substrate, was recently found\nexperimentally.19 Ab initio calculations indicate that the\nobserved gap opening is due to the confinement effect in\nthe residual bare graphene regions.19\nThe edge states of graphene/graphane superlattices\nwhere recently considered in the tight-binding approximation. If the interface is oriented along a zigzag direction, edge states enhance effects related to the spinorbit interaction.20 The stability of graphene/graphane\nnanoribbons was also studied from ab initio calculations, and it was predicted that the graphene/graphane\nnanoribbons are stable down to the limit of a single carbon chain.21\nPatterned fluoridation of graphene is another potential way for making graphene nanoribbons. Experimental evidences of graphene fluoridation was recently\nreported.22,23 Graphene fluoride is a two-dimensional material that exhibits an insulating behavior similar to\ngraphane,22,23 which can be also used to create superlattices of graphene nanoribbons.\nIn this paper, we carry out spin-polarized ab initio calculations to study the electronic and magnetic properties\nof superlattices of zigzag graphene/graphane nanoribbons (ZGGNRs). We study three cases: (i) when all\nthe interfaces between the graphene/graphane nanoribbons are fully hydrogenated, (ii) when one edge of the\n\n\f2\nnanoribbons is fully hydrogenated and the other edge\nis half-hydrogenated, and (iii) when all the interfaces of\nthe superlattice are half hydrogenated (see Fig. 1). We\nfound that the magnetic ground state of the ZGGNRs\nare semiconducting in the above three cases but the electronic and magnetic properties strongly depend on the\ndegree of hydrogenation of the interfaces.\nThe calculations were performed with the QUANTUM\nESPRESSO package24 employing spin-polarized densityfunctional theory and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhoff\nexchange-correlation functional.25 An ultra-soft pseudopotential description of the ion-electron interaction26\nwas used together with a plane-wave basis set for the\nelectronic wave functions and the charge density, with\nenergy cutoffs of 40 Ry and 400 Ry, respectively. The\nelectronic Brillouin zone integration was sampled with\na 16 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 uniform k-point mesh and a Gaussian\nsmearing of 0.01 Ry.\nThe two-dimensional behavior of the graphene/graphane nanoribbons was simulated by adding a vacuum region of 12 \u00c5 above the\ngraphene/graphane sheets. All the structures were relaxed using a criteria of forces and stresses on atoms of\n0.001eV/\u00c5 and 0.5GPa, respectively.\n\nII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nOne or both of the two carbon atoms in each unit cell\nof the zigzag chain at the graphene/graphane interface\ncan be hydrogenated (see Fig. 1). The degree of hydrogenation of the zigzag chains has a very important influence on the electronic properties of the ZGGNRs. In\nthe following, we will refer to the fully covered hydrogen interface as an \u03b1 interface and to the half-covered\ninterface as a \u03b2 interface, as shown in Fig. 1. In principle, if we allow the hydrogen deposition to start on a\ncertain sublattice of graphene, it would be possible to experimentally control the degree of hydrogenation of the\ninterfaces.\nZigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNR) are usually classified by the number of zigzag chains across the ribbon\nwidth.8,11 In order to simplify the analysis, we considered superlattices of zigzag graphene/graphane nanoribbons where both, graphene and graphane nanoribbons,\nare six-chains wide. This means that the unit cell of Fig.\n1(a) has 24 carbon and 12 hydrogen atoms. The degree of\nhydrogenation at the interface, and therefore the number\nof hydrogen atoms, decreases from Fig. 1(a)-1(c).\nThe interface between graphene and graphane nanoribbons is an interface between sp2 and sp3 bonded carbon\natoms. Carbon atoms in graphene have a sp2 hybridization and the structure stabilizes as a flat sheet. The\nhybridization changes from sp2 to sp3 in graphane due\nto the presence of alternating hydrogen atoms placed on\nboth sides of the carbon plane. The sp3 hybridization\nalso forces nearest-neighbor carbon atoms in graphane to\nlie in different planes, and the resulting graphane structure is undulating.15\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Relaxed zigzag graphene/graphane\nnanoribbons. (a) Both graphene/graphane interfaces are fully\nhydrogenated (two \u03b1 interfaces), (b) one of the interfaces is\nfully hydrogenated and the other one is half-hydrogenated (\u03b1\u03b2\nnanoribbon), and (c) both interfaces are half-hydrogenated\nresulting in \u03b2\u03b2 nanoribbons. Carbon atoms are represented\nby large (yellow) spheres and hydrogens atoms by small (light\nblue) spheres. We include a side view and a perspective view\nof the relaxed structures for each case. The unit cells of the\nsuperlattices are shown by dashed-dotted lines in the side\nviews.\n\nRelaxed structures of the ZGGNRs are shown in Fig. 1.\nAll structures were fully relaxed according to the forces\nand stresses on the atoms by using spin-polarized calculations. When both interfaces are fully hydrogenated\n(two \u03b1 interfaces) one side of the graphene nanoribbon is pushed up and the other side is pushed down by\nthe graphane sp3 -bonded carbon atoms. This induces a\ntilt angle of 164\u00b0 between adjacent graphene/graphane\nnanoribbons as shown in Fig. 1(a). To satisfy the\nconditions imposed by the sp3 /sp2 carbon interface,\n\n\f3\nthe graphene nanoribbon is tilted with respect to the\ngraphane plane but it remains flat. A similar situation\noccurs when both interfaces are half-hydrogenated (two\n\u03b2-type interfaces) as shown in Fig. 1(c). In this case, the\ntilt angle between the graphene and graphane nanoribbons is 166.6 degrees. When one interface is fully hydrogenated and the other one is half-hydrogenated (\u03b1\u03b2\nsuperlattice), the graphene nanoribbon is pushed down\nat both edges by the graphane sp3 -bonded carbon atoms.\nThis results in a curvature of the graphene nanoribbons\nas shown in Fig. 1(b).\nIt is known that a freestanding \u03b1\u03b2 graphene nanoribbon is not stable. We found that by using spatially selective hydrogenation of graphene we are able to create\nstable \u03b1\u03b2 nanoribbons. The stability of those nanoribbons was checked by allowing relaxation of the structure\nin our ab initio calculations.\nWe also addressed the question about the feasibility of\nappearance of the zigzag interface by comparing it with\nthe armchair interface. We prepared two supercells (one\nwith a zigzag and the other one with an armchair arrangements of atoms) forming graphene/graphane nanoribbons and containing the same number of atoms (108\natoms), 72C and 36H. The zigzag supercell is equivalent to three times the unit cell of Fig. 1(a) replicated\nalong the graphene/graphane nanoribbon. We obtained\na very small energy difference between these zigzag and\narmchair graphene/graphane nanoribbons, only 0.002\neV/atom. This value is smaller than our numerical accuracy, and it is also very small if we compare it with\nthe thermal energy at room temperature, 0.025eV. We\ncan conclude that the formation energy of zigzag and\narmchair graphene/graphane nanoribbons are equally favorable at room temperature. This situation is different\nfrom the case of freestanding nanoribbons where it was\nfound that the zigzag edge is metastable, because it shows\na planar reconstruction to lower its energy.12 This shows\nthat graphene/graphane superlattices are a more convenient way for stabilizing zigzag graphene nanoribbons.\nIn calculations not shown here, we carried out structure relaxations where the volume of the unit cell is\nkept constant and equal to the volume of an equivalent graphane system and where only the forces between\natoms are relaxed. This is equivalent to the experimental situation where graphene nanoribbons are carved in\na graphane sheet with fixed borders. In this case, we\nfound no tilt angles between the graphene and graphane\nnanoribbons and only a very small curvature for the \u03b1\u03b2\nsuperlattice. The electronic or magnetic properties of the\nsystem did not change in a significant way if we compare\nwith the fully relaxed case.\nIn the following sections, we discuss separately the electronic and magnetic properties of the ZGGNRs with different degree of hydrogenation at the interfaces.\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Three-dimensional (3D) graph of the\nspin density (\u03c1\u2191 \u2212 \u03c1\u2193 ) of the \u03b1\u03b1 zigzag graphene/graphane\nnanoribbon. (a) Spin density of the antiferromagnetic ground\nstate and (b) spin density of the metastable ferromagnetic\nstate. In both cases, the magnetization is almost completely\nlocalized in the graphene nanoribbons, and the edges of the\ngraphane nanoribbons are only slightly magnetized. Regions\nwith positive spin density are represented in red (dark gray)\nand regions with a negative spin density are shown in light\nblue (light gray). Isosurfaces corresponds to (\u03c1\u2191 \u2212 \u03c1\u2193 )=0.02\ne/\u00c53 , where e is the electron charge.\n\nA.\n\nTwo fully hydrogenated interfaces: \u03b1\u03b1 zigzag\ngraphene/graphane nanoribbons\n\nWe first analyze the case where both zigzag interfaces\nare fully hydrogenated. The ground state of the system corresponds to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering between the two opposite graphene edges and a ferromagnetic (FM) ordering along the zigzag carbon chains.\nWe will refer to this state as an AFM state. The spin\ndensity (\u03c1\u2191 \u2212 \u03c1\u2193 ) of the AFM state is represented in\nFig. 2(a) while the metastable FM state (ferromagnetic\nordering both between the two graphene edges and along\nthe zigzag carbon chains) is represented in Fig. 2(b).\nThe total magnetic moment and the absolute magnetic moment for the FM state are 0.59\u03bcB /cell and\n0.95\u03bcB /cell, respectively (\u03bcB is the Bohr magneton).\nThe AFM state has an absolute magnetic moment of\n1.09\u03bcB /cell.\nThe spin density (\u03c1\u2191 \u2212\u03c1\u2193 ) of the \u03b1\u03b1 ZGGNR are mostly\nconcentrated in the graphene nanoribbons as shown in\nFigs. 2(a) and 2(b).

Spin up and spin down bands coincide in (a),\n(c), and (d).\n\nstate. As a consequence, in the middle of the graphene\nnanoribbon, the spin density is lower in the FM state\nthan in the AFM state. This explains the difference of\n0.14\u03bcB /cell in the absolute magnetization between both\nmagnetic states.\nWe also carried out ab initio calculations with a unit\ncell twice larger along the zigzag carbon chains to explore\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Side and perspective views of spin\ndensity of the ferromagnetic ground state of the \u03b1\u03b2 ZGGNRs.\nAround the \u03b2 interface the spin density is larger than in the\n\u03b1 interface. The \u03b2-edge of the graphane nanoribbon is also\nmagnetized, while the spin-state of the \u03b1 edge is similar to\nFig. 2. Regions with positive spin density are represented in\nred (dark gray) and regions with a negative spin density are\nshown in light blue (light gray). Isosurfaces corresponds to\n(\u03c1\u2191 \u2212 \u03c1\u2193 )=0.02 e/\u00c53 .\n\nThe band structure of the AFM state of an equivalent six-chains wide ZGNR, thus without graphane, is\nrepresented in Fig. 3(d). We see that, near the Fermi\nlevel, the band structure of the AFM state of the superlattice [Fig. 3 (a)] is very similar to the band structure\nof the AFM state of a graphene nanoribbon in vacuum\n\n\f5\n[Fig. 3(d)]. This similarity is also observed in all the\nother metastable states. Thus, near the Fermi level, the\nband structure of the superlattice is dominated by the\ncontribution of the graphene nanoribbons.\nWe carefully compared the magnetic behavior of isolated six-chains wide ZGGNR with graphene nanoribbons embedded in graphane. The comparison between\ntheir electronic and magnetic properties are summarized\nin Table I. We found very small differences in the energy\nbandgaps, magnetic moments, and energy differences between the different magnetic states of graphene nanoribbons in vacuum and patterned in graphane. These results\nshow that patterning graphene nanoribbons in graphane\nis a promising way of obtaining zigzag graphene nanoribbons with the same electronic and magnetic properties\nas in vacuum.\nIn the four cases represented in Fig. 3, localized edge\nstates generate flat bands near the Fermi level. Information about the spatial localization of the edge states\ncan be obtained by analyzing the partial (or band decomposed) charge density (PCD). This magnitude is also\ncalled integrated local density of states (ILDOS), which\ndescribes the density of states but space resolved, and it\nis useful when interpreting the data from STM experiments. In the following, we will use the term PCD.\nFigure 5(a) shows the spatial localization or PCD of\nthe edge states around Ef (Ef \u00b1 0.02eV) for the nonmagnetic case. If we exclude the states at Ef , and do an\nintegration from Ef \u22120.09eV to Ef \u22121eV, we see that the\nstates become less localized, see Fig. 5(b). An interesting\nfeature in Fig. 5(b) is that near each edge of the graphene\nnanoribbon only one of the two carbon sublattices makes\na large contribution to the states near the Fermi level.\nIn fact, we can appreciate from Fig. 5(b) that different\ncarbon sublattices contribute at both edges while just in\nthe middle of the graphene nanoribbon both sublattices\ncontribute to the bands. The main contribution of the\nother carbon sublattice is located near the center of the\nBrillouin zone at the \u0393 point. These states lie at lower\nenergies (Ef \u2212 2eV) and are entangled with the bands\ncoming from the graphane nanoribbon.\nAll the above mentioned features of the band structure\nand the PCD of \u03b1\u03b1 ZGGNRs can be captured qualitatively with a simple tight-binding model, which results\nare summarized in Figs. 9(a) and 9(d) of the Appendix.\n\nB. Superlattice with one interface fully\nhydrogenated and the other one half-hydrogenated:\n\u03b1\u03b2 ZGGNRs\n\nWhen one of the interfaces is half-hydrogenated and\nthe other one is fully hydrogenated the spin-polarized\nground state of the system corresponds to a ferromagnetic ordering, both along the graphene/graphane interface and between the two edges of the graphene nanoribbon.

Red regions corresponds to majority spins (c),\nblue to minority spin (d), and violet means that both spins\ncomponents were included in (a), (b), and (e).\n\nIf we compare with an \u03b1\u03b1 ZGGNR, the absolute magnetization increases to 1.73\u03bcB /cell and the total magnetization to 1.0\u03bcB /cell in the \u03b1\u03b2 ZGGNR. The side view\nof the spin density in Fig. 4 shows that the \u03b2-edge of the\ngraphane nanoribbons is also spin polarized.\nThe band structure of the \u03b1\u03b2 ZGGNRs are shown in\nFig. 6. The FM ground state shows a semiconducting behavior [Fig. 6(a)]. There are two spin-polarized flat bands\nnear the Fermi level with a direct bandgap of 0.58eV.\nFerromagnetic semiconductors have attracted a great interest since 1990s because they may lead to spintronics\napplications.27 \u03b1\u03b2 zigzag graphene/graphane nanoribbons may be an alternative for the well-studied diluted\nmagnetic semiconductors (DMS) materials27 with the\nfundamental difference that the system is purely twodimensional in this case.

The energy difference between the ferromagnetic and the nonmagnetic state\nis EF M \u2212 ENM = 76meV/edge atom.\n\nFig. 6(b).\nIf we compare the energy difference between the magnetic and the nonmagnetic cases for the three different\ntypes of nanoribbons shown in Table II, we can see that\nthe largest energy difference between the nonmagnetic\nand magnetic cases occurs for \u03b1\u03b2 ZGGNRs. This indicates that the FM state of \u03b1\u03b2 ZGGNRs could be even\nmore stable than the other cases considered in this work\nand summarized in Table II.\n\u03b1\u03b2 ZGGNRs have an extra carbon atom and, therefore, an odd number of atoms in the graphene nanoribbons (13 carbon atoms in this case). This adds up one\nextra band near the Fermi level, which can be appreci-\n\nated by comparing the nonmagnetic states of Figs. 3(c)\nand 6(b). The two bands that were previously dominating the behavior near the Fermi level in \u03b1\u03b1 ZGGNRs\nare now, respectively, pushed up and down in energy and\nvery flat bands appear near the Fermi level, both for the\nFM ground state of Fig. 6(a) and for the nonmagnetic\nmetastable state of Fig. 6(b).\nFigures 6(c) and 6(d) are zooms of the states near\nthe Fermi level for the FM and non magnetic states, respectively. Even when the bands are very flat, there is\na small dispersion that is caused by the interaction with\nthe graphene/graphane interfaces.\nThe results of the simple tight-binding model shown\nin Figs. 9(b) and 9(e) reproduce qualitatively the behavior of the nonmagnetic band structure. However, the\nband at the Fermi level is completely flat. In order to\nobtain dispersion in this band, we need to include an\ninteraction with the graphane nanoribbon. This can be\ndone by introducing an extra row of carbon atoms coupled with hydrogen as in graphane, which simulates the\ngraphene/graphane interface. In doing so we find an extra band with a dispersion comparable to those from our\nab initio simulations. The band width does not appreciably depend on the width of the graphene nanoribbon.\nMore complicated tight-binding models for the case of\nan \u03b1\u03b2 ZGGNRs where introduced in Ref. 20. However,\nthe obtained band width20 was four times larger than the\none found with our ab initio results.\nA very interesting feature of the PCD of the FM\nground state of Figs. 5(c) and 5(d) is that only one of\nthe carbon sublattices is contributing to the edge state.\nThe same happens for the nonmagnetic metastable state\n(not shown here). This can be incorporated in a simple\ntight-binding model represented in Fig. 9(e).

Superlattice with the two edges\nhalf-hydrogenated: \u03b2\u03b2 zigzag graphene/graphane\nnanoribbons\n\nWe consider now the case of the \u03b2\u03b2 superlattice represented in Fig. 1(c). The spin-polarized ground state is\nthe AFM state as was also the case in the \u03b1\u03b1 superlattice.\nFigure 7 shows the spin density for the AFM ground state\nof the \u03b2\u03b2 ZGGNR. Both edges of the graphane nanoribbon contributes to the spin polarization of the system.\nThis can be better appreciated in the side view at the\ntop of Fig. 7. The absolute magnetic moment of the\nAFM state is 1.92 \u03bcB /cell, almost twice larger than in\nthe AFM state of the \u03b1\u03b1 ZGGNR (1.09 \u03bcB /cell).\nFigure 8(a) shows the band structure of the AFM\nground state of the \u03b2\u03b2 ZGGNR and the nonmagnetic\nmetastable state is shown in Fig. 8(b). Both are semiconducting states while the energy band gap of the AFM\nstate (0.76eV) is larger than in the nonmagnetic case\n(0.29eV). It is interesting to note that even when we have\na nonmagnetic state with a bandgap there is a transition\nto a magnetic state by further increasing the bandgap.\nThe properties of both states are summarized in Table II.\nThe partial charge density graph of the AFM phase\nnear the Fermi level obtained from Ef to Ef \u2212 0.16eV\nshows that the edge states of the \u03b2\u03b2 superlattice extend\nalso to the edge of the graphane nanoribbon as shown\nin Fig. 5(e).

Figure 9(f)\nalso correlates with the ab initio PCD of Fig. 5(e). This is\ndiscussed in more detail in the Appendix. We see that the\ndifferent carbon sublattices contribute differently near\neach edge. This situation is similar to the case we explained before for the \u03b1\u03b1 ZGGNRs.\n\nIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe degree of hydrogenation of the graphene/graphane\ninterface has an important influence on the electronic\nand magnetic properties of the zigzag graphene/graphane\nnanoribbons. This parameter could be controlled experimentally to tune the bandgap and the magnetic properties of graphene/graphane superlattices.\nWe found that independent of the degree of hydrogenation of both interfaces the ground state of the system is\nsemiconducting. However, the band structure near the\nFermi level changes dramatically due to the contribution\nof the edge states in the three different superlattices.\n\n\f8\nWhile the ground state of the system is antiferromagnetic in \u03b1\u03b1 and \u03b2\u03b2 ZGGNRs, it is ferromagnetic for \u03b1\u03b2\nZGGNRs.\nOur results show that \u03b1\u03b1 ZGGNRs are a promising\nway to obtain stable graphene nanoribbons with similar\nelectronic and magnetic properties as freestanding zigzag\nnanoribbons. The basic properties of freestanding zigzag\ngraphene edges are preserved when the system binds on\nboth edges to insulating graphane regions. We also found\nthat the energy difference between zigzag and an armchair graphene/graphane nanoribbons is very small, the\nenergy difference per atom is one order of magnitude\nsmaller than the thermal energy at room temperature.\nThis means that the formation energies of zigzag and\narmchair graphene/graphane nanoribbons are equally favorable at room temperature. This situation is different from the case of freestanding nanoribbons where it\nwas found that the zigzag edge is metastable, because\nit shows a planar reconstruction to lower its energy.12\nThen, graphene/graphane superlattices seem a promising way to solve structural and stability problems faced\nby freestanding nanoribbons.\nWe proposed a single atom thick ferromagnetic semiconductor in \u03b1\u03b2 zigzag graphene/graphane nanoribbons.\nIt may be an alternative for the well-studied DMS\nmaterials27 with the fundamental difference that the system is purely two-dimensional in this case. Diluted semiconductors are of interest from both fundamental and\napplied points of view, and may soon lead to spintronics\ndevices with new functionalities.27\n\u03b1\u03b2 ZGGNRs can also be analyzed in a more general\nframework. In order to render a ZGNR half metallic,\nthe symmetry between the left and right edges of the\nzigzag nanoribbon should be broken. For example, in\nRef. 11 this was done by applying an electric field to\nthe system, in Ref. 9 this was done by adding a Klein's\nedge to one side of the nanoribbon, and in Ref. 10 the\ntwo zigzag edges were terminated with different terminal\ngroups, such as NO2 and CH3 . The present work shows\nthat in graphene/graphane superlattices, this could be\nachieved by controling the degree of hydrogenation at\nthe two edges.\nFrom Fig. 6(c) we can appreciate that the ferromagnetic ground state of \u03b1\u03b2 ZGGNRs is almost a half metal.\nAs the Fermi level is in between two spin-polarized bands,\nwith little charge doping the Fermi level can be shifted\neither to the spin-up or spin-down band. This could be\nused in a potentially interesting electronic device. So\nhalf-metalicity in \u03b1\u03b2 ZGGNRs can be achieved not with\nthe help of an external electric field as in Ref. 11 but\nwith charge doping, which could offer new technological\nalternatives.\nIt is known that the width of the nanoribbons has\na strong influence on the bandgap of the graphene\nnanoribbons8,11 as well as on the bandgap of the\ngraphane nanoribbons.17,18 Both, the width of the\ngraphene nanoribbons and the level of hydrogenation at\nthe interface can be used to control the electronic and\n\nmagnetic properties of graphene/graphane nanoribbons.\nWhile the width of the graphane region can be used to\ncontrol the energy window where graphene and graphane\nbands entangle.\nMost of the qualitative features obtained in our ab\ninitio calculations can be explained with a simple tightbinding model incorporated in the appendix. This shows\nthat the present results can be qualitatively extrapolated\nto other type of superlattices where graphene nanoribbons are patterned by selective absorption of different\natoms. Another interesting candidate, with similar or\neven better characteristics as graphane is graphene fluoride, a two-dimensional material that has been recently\nsynthesized.22,23\n\nIV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by the Flemish Science\nFoundation (FWO-VI), the Belgian Science Policy\n(IAP), and the collaborative project FWO-MINCyT\n(FW/08/01).

Here we focus only on the graphene\npart of the nanoribbon. To construct the tight-binding\nHamiltonian we consider a tight-binding Bloch function\nper atom in the primitive cell\nN\n1 X\n\u03c8~ki (~r) = \u221a\n\u03c6(~r \u2212 ~ri ) exp(i~k * ~ri ),\nN i\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere ~ri is the position of a carbon atom in the primitive\ncell, and \u03c6 denotes the pz -like atomic wavefunction of a\ncarbon atom. N is the number of considered unit cells.\nAll carbon atoms are positioned on the (unrelaxed) honeycomb lattice as in pure graphene. We consider a zigzag\nnanoribbon with the same number Nc of carbon atoms\nin the unit cell as in the graphene/graphane nanoribbons\nstudied in this paper. For two \u03b1 edges Nc = 12 , for a\nnanoribbon with one \u03b1 and one \u03b2 edge Nc = 13, and\nNc = 14 in case of two \u03b2 edges.

The obtained spectra agree qualitatively with\nthe corresponding ab initio ones for the non-magnetic\ngraphene/graphane nanoribbons in Figs. 3(c), 6(b), and\n8(b). Note the absence of dispersion of the band at E = 0\nfor the \u03b1\u03b2 graphene nanoribbon [Fig. 9(b)], in contrast\nto the ab initio result where a small dispersion was observed, see Fig. 6(d). This dispersion is a consequence\nof the graphane edge, which is not taken into account in\nthe present tight-binding model.\nBelow each band structure of Fig. 9, we plot the corresponding coefficients |Ci |2 from Eq. (A2) of the highest\nvalence band eigenstate. Each curve is labeled by a letter\nindicating the corresponding atom in the nanoribbon unit\ncell. Figure 9(d) shows that in case of an \u03b1\u03b1 nanoribbon,\nthe highest valence band state is located at both edges of\nthe nanoribbon, represented by the carbon atoms A and\nL. The next most important contribution is not located\nat carbon atoms B and K, but at atoms C and J. Note\nthat these two atoms (C and J) belong to different sub-\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\nElectronic address: alexande@cab.cnea.gov.ar\nElectronic address: francois.peeters@ua.ac.be\nK.

The results of Fig. 9(d) can be correlated with the ab initio results of the PCD represented\nin Figs. 5(a) and 5(b).\nOn the other hand, for the case of an \u03b1\u03b2 nanoribbon\n[Fig. 9(b)], the dispersionless band at the Fermi level is\nentirely built up from atoms that belong to one sublattice. The contributions coming from the other sublattice\ngiven by the coefficients B, D, F, H, J, and L are all zero.\nThis is also the case for the ferromagnetic ground state\nof the \u03b1\u03b2 nanoribbon as can be seen in the integrated\nlocal density of states of Figs. 5(c) and 5(d).\nThe case of a nanoribbon with two \u03b2 edges is similar to\nthe \u03b1\u03b1 nanoribbon. The highest valence band is again\nbuilt up from the edge atoms M and N, see Fig. 9(f).\nWhile the contribution from the neighboring atoms belonging to the other sublattice (atoms A and L, or C and\nJ) is again rather small.\nThe present tight-binding model can be extended to\ndescribe the magnetic properties of the system, for example, by using the Hubbard model, as it was discussed\nin Ref. 9.\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n27\n\nB 75, 153401 (2007).\nD.
