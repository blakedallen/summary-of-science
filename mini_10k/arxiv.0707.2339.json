In our extensive study of the dust and gas content, and\nstar formation activity, of the host galaxies of z > 2, luminous (M\n< \u221226.1), optically\n1450\u00c5\nselected high redshift quasars (Omont et al. 2003; Carilli et al. 2002; Bertoldi et al. 2003a;\nPetric et al. 2003; Beelen et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2007a), we have found that roughly 30%\nof these sources are also hyper-luminous infrared galaxies (LF IR \u223c 1013 L\u2299 ). This FIR emission corresponds to thermal emission from warm dust. Searches for CO emission from these\nsources typically yield molecular gas masses \u2265 1010 M\u2299 (Solomon & Vanden Bout 2005).\nSuch molecular gas represents the fuel for star formation, and can serve as a dynamical tracer\nin a forming galaxy.\nAn important finding of our program is that the 30% fraction of FIR luminous quasars\ncontinues to the highest redshifts, z \u223c 6, approaching the end of cosmic reionization, and\nhence pushing toward the very first galaxies and SMBHs (eg. Fan, Carilli, & Keating 2006;\nFan et al. 2006a). A particularly enlightening example is the highest redshift quasar known,\nJ1148+5251 at z = 6.419. The host galaxy has been detected in thermal dust, non-thermal\nradio continuum, and CO line emission (Walter et al. 2003; Bertoldi al. 2003b; Carilli et\nal. 2004), with an FIR luminosity (integrated between 42.5\u03bcm and 122\u03bcm) of 1.3 \u00d7 1013 L\u2299\n(Beelen et al. 2006), a molecular gas mass of \u223c 2 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , and a dust mass of 7 \u00d7 108\nM\u2299 . The dynamical mass to a radius of 2.5 kpc in the host galaxy, as estimated from high\nresolution VLA imaging of the molecular gas distribution, is comparable to the gas mass, but\nmuch less than the mass predicted by the black hole mass \u2013 bulge mass relation measured\nat low redshift (Walter et al. 2004). We have also detected the dominant cooling line of\ninterstellar gas, [CII] 158 \u03bcm, from J1148+5251 (Maiolino et al. 2005). These observations\ndemonstrate that large reservoirs of dust and metal enriched atomic and molecular gas can\nexist in massive galaxies within 1 Gyr of the Big Bang. The current observations suggest\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nactive star formation in the host galaxy, with a massive star formation rate of order 103 M\u2299\nyear\u22121 , although the question remains as to the contribution to dust heating by the AGN\n(Wang et al. 2007a; Li et al. 2007a).\nThe source SDSS J092721.82+200123.7 (hereafter J0927+2001) is similar to J1148+5251\nin many ways. J0927+2001 is a quasar selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (York\net al. 2000), with an optical redshift of z = 5.77 \u00b1 0.03 (corresponding to tuniv = 1 Gyr,\nassuming a standard concordance cosmology), based on fitting to the (relatively weak) Ly\u03b1\n+ NV lines, and with Lbol = 7 \u00d7 1013 erg s\u22121 (Fan et al. 2006b; Wang et al. 2007a). The\nblack hole mass estimated from both the Eddington limit, and from UV line widths, is \u223c 109\nM\u2299 (Jiang et al. 2007).\nJ0927+2001 has been detected in 250 GHz continuum emission at the IRAM 30m telescope, with a flux density of 5.0\u00b10.8 mJy (Wang et al. 2006), and at 350 GHz at the Caltech\nSubmm Observatory, with a flux density of 18 \u00b1 5 mJy (Wang et al. 2007b, in preparation).\nThese data, in combination with lower and higher frequency data, reveal a clear FIR excess\nover a standard quasar IR SED. This FIR excess corresponds to thermal emission from warm\ndust with a temperature \u223c 47 K. The dust mass is 6.9 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 , and the FIR luminosity\nis 1.2 \u00d7 1013 L\u2299 . A weak (45 \u00b1 14\u03bcJy) radio continuum counterpart has been detected at\n1.4 GHz, and the rest-frame radio through FIR SED is within the range defined by star\nforming galaxies (Wang et al. 2007a). The observations of J0927+2001 are consistent with\na massive (stars > 5 M\u2299 ) star formation rate of \u223c 700 M\u2299 year\u22121 (Kennicutt 1998), or a\ntotal star formation rate (stars > 0.1 M\u2299 ) a factor 5.6 higher, assuming a Salpeter initial\nmass function, and assuming the warm (47 K) dust is heated by star formation.\nIn this letter we present the discovery of CO 5-4 and 6-5 emission from J0927+2001.\nThese observations reveal the necessary fuel for star formation, and enable a number of key\nobservations in the study of the earliest generation of massive galaxies and SMBH.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and results\n\nOur observations have been made with the improved Plateau de Bure interferometer\nequipped with the new generation of receivers. With their increased sensitivity (detection of\nsub-mJy lines in a single track), and increased bandwidth (2 of the 4 GHz with the current\ncorrelator), these new receivers allow for deep searches for faint redshifted molecular emission\nlines over bandwidths adequate to cover the typical uncertainties of optical redshifts of high\nredshift quasars.\nWe searched for CO 5-4 emission from J0927+2001 with the Plateau de Bure Interfer-\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nometer in April and May, 2007. The first track (8 hours) used two polarizations, and two\nfrequency settings which covered a total bandwidth of 1.8 GHz (= 5700 km s\u22121 or \u2206z =\n0.13) centered at z = 5.79 (or 84.87 GHz for redshifted CO 5-4). After a possible line was\nidentified in the first observations at z \u223c 5.77, a second 8 hour track was observed centered\non the line at 85.12 GHz, covering a total bandwidth of 1 GHz using dual polarization. This\nsecond track confirmed the 5-4 line with high significance. A third 8 hour track was then\nobserved centered on the frequency of the CO 6-5 line redshifted to 102.10 GHz, which was\nalso clearly detected. The spectral resolution for all observations was 2.5 MHz channel\u22121 .\nThe phase stability, as measured on the phase calibrator (0851+202) was easily adequate for\ncoherent integration in the D configuration, for which the interferometric synthesized beam\nhad a FWHM \u223c 5\". Absolute gain calibration was performed on the star MWC349.\nFigure 1 shows the spectra of the CO 5-4 and 6-5 emission lines from J0927+2001 at a\nspectral resolution of 70 km s\u22121 channel\u22121 . The rms per channel varies slightly across the\nspectra, but typical values for the 5-4 spectrum are 0.37 mJy beam\u22121 for 5-4, and 0.52 mJy\nbeam\u22121 for 6-5.\nBoth CO emission lines are clearly detected, as well as the underlying continuum emission at both frequencies. Gaussian fitting to the lines yield the parameters listed in Table\n1, including: the continuum level, the line peak flux density and FWHM, the velocity in\u22122\ntegrated line flux, and the line luminosity, L\u2032 (CO) = 3.25 \u00d7 1013 (1 + z)I\u2206vDA2 \u03bdobs\nK km\n\u22121\n2\n\u22121\ns pc , where I\u2206v is the velocity integrated flux density in Jy km s , DA is the angular\ndiameter distance in Gpc (DA = 1.23 Gpc at z = 5.77), and \u03bdobs is the observing frequency\nin GHz (Solomon et al. 1997). A linewidth of 600 \u00b1 70 km s\u22121 , and an LSR line centroid\nof z = 5.7722 \u00b1 0.0006, are derived from the spectrum obtained by merging the CO 5-4 and\n6-5 data.\nThe measured continuum level for the combined data is 0.12 \u00b1 0.03 mJy. Combined\nwith the continuum observations at 250 GHz and 350 GHz, this yields a dust temperature of\n47 K, assuming a modified grey body of index \u03b2 = 1.6 (see analysis in Wang et al. 2007b).\nFigure 2 shows the image of the velocity integrated line emission from the weighted\nsum of the 5-4 and 6-5 lines. The peak of the CO emission is at: (J2000) 09h 27m 21.79s +\n20\u25e6 01\u2032 23.5\u2032\u2032 , or within 0.2\" of the optical position. The source appears unresolved at the\npresent resolution of FWHM \u223c 5\".\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n3.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe ratio of the strength of the two CO transitions is: L\u20326\u22125 /L\u20325\u22124 = 1.10 \u00b1 0.27. This\nratio is consistent with constant brightness temperature (ie. ratio = 1) up to CO 6-5.\nThe high CO excitation in J0927+2001 is comparable to that seen in the host galaxy of\nJ1148+5251 (Bertoldi et al. 2003), and other high redshift quasars (Solomon & Vanden\nBout 2005; Carilli et al. 2002; Weiss et al. 2007 in prep), as well as in the nuclei of nearby\nnuclear starburst galaxies, such as NGC 253 and Arp 220 (Greve et al. 2006; Bradford et al.\n2003), implying warm (> 50K), dense (> 104 cm\u22123 ) gas. However, given the close spacing of\nthe two transitions, observations of a lower order transition (1-0 or 2-1) are needed to better\nconstrain the gas excitation conditions.\nWe derive the total molecular gas mass (dominated by H2 ) from the CO luminosity\nusing the conversion factor for CO luminosity to total molecular gas mass appropriate for\nUltra-luminous Infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, or galaxies with LF IR > 1012 L\u2299 year\u22121 ; Downes\n& Solomon 1998), or X = 0.8 M\u2299 (K km s\u22121 pc2 )\u22121 , and assuming constant brightness\ntemperature from CO 5-4 down to CO 1-0 (ie. constant L\u2032 (CO)). The implied gas mass is:\nMH2 = 0.8 \u00d7 L\u2032CO1\u22120 = (1.6 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 . Note that the CO luminosity to gas mass\nconversion factor is a factor five smaller for ULIRGs than it is for normal galaxies, such as\nthe Milky Way. For a detailed discussion of the conversion of CO luminosity to gas mass in\nhigh redshift, FIR luminous galaxies, see Solomon & Vanden Bout (2005).\nThe ratio of FIR luminosity to CO luminosity has been used as a metric for the relative\nstar formation efficiency in galaxies (ie. proportional to the star formation rate per unit gas\nmass; Gao & Solomon 2004). For J0927+2001, we find: LF IR /L\u2032CO = 650 L\u2299 (K km s\u22121\npc2 )\u22121 . In their review of molecular line emission from galaxies at z > 1, Solomon & Vanden\nBout (2005) find that the values of LF IR /L\u2032CO range between roughly 100 and 1000, with a\nmean value of 350 L\u2299 (K km s\u22121 pc2 )\u22121 , for galaxies with typical FIR luminosities between\n1012 and 1013 L\u2299 . For comparison, lower luminosity star forming galaxies (LF IR < 1011 L\u2299 )\nhave LF IR /L\u2032CO ratios an order of magnitude smaller (Kennicutt 1998). J0927+2001 follows\nthis general trend for increasing star formation efficiency with increasing FIR luminosity.\nThese results suggest a relatively short gas depletion timescale \u2261 (gas mass)/(star formation\nrate) \u223c 107 years, implying a brief, but very intense, starburst. This timescale is comparable\nto the typical lifetime of luminous, high redshift quasars derived from the clustering of\nquasars in the SDSS by Shen et al. (2007). Of course, these arguments assume the FIR\nexcess is due to dust heated by star formation, and not the AGN.\nAlthough the gas mass in J0927+2001 is comparable to that in J1148+5251, the line\nwidth of 600 km s\u22121 is almost a factor two broader than the CO emission from J1148+5251,\nand is at the high end of the CO line width distribution observed for high redshift quasar host\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\ngalaxies (Carilli & Wang 2006; Greve et al. 2005). A simple explanation for a broader line\nwould be that the gas disk is more inclined to the sky plane in J0927+2001. High resolution\nimaging of the CO distribution is required to determine the extent, and dynamics, of the\nmolecular gas.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nJ0927+2001 is the second example of an extreme molecular gas mass in a galaxy within 1\nGyr of the Big Bang. Like J1148+5251 at z = 6.42, J0927+2001 shows many characteristics\nof a co-eval massive starburst in the host galaxy of the quasar (Section 1; Wang et al.\n2007b). The observations presented herein reveal the requisite molecular gas reservoir to\nfuel the star formation. As in the case of J1148+5251, Walter et al. (2004) point out that\nthe formation of the heavy elements, and in particular, the ISM processing required to form\ncooler molecular gas and dust, implies that star formation must have commenced very early\nin the host galaxy, at least a few hundred million years prior, or z > 8.\nThese results lead to the question: how are such massive galaxies and SMBH formed\nwithin 1 Gyr of the Big Bang? Li et al. (2007a, b) have addressed this question through\nmulti-scale cosmological simulations, including prescriptions for the complex processes of\nstar formation and AGN feed-back. They find that early galaxy and SMBH formation is\npossible in rare (comoving density \u223c 1 Gpc\u22123 ), high density peaks (halo mass \u223c 8 \u00d7 1012\nM\u2299 at z \u223c 6), in the cosmic density field, through a series of gas-rich, massive mergers\nstarting at z \u223c 14. SMBH formation occurs through a combination of Eddington-limited\naccretion in each progenitor galaxy, plus rapid black hole mergers during galaxy interactions.\nThe stellar spheroids are formed in merger-driven, extreme starbursts, with star formation\nrates exceeding 103 M\u2299 year\u22121 for short periods (\u223c 107 years). The ISM atomic abundances\nrapidly approach Solar in the inner few kpc. Li et al. (2007b) suggest that such systems\nevolve into massive galaxies at the centers of the densest cluster environments seen today\n(\u223c 1015 M\u2299 ).\nLi et al. (2007a) hypothesize that systems such as J1148+5251 and J0927+2001 may\nbe in a late starburst phase, where the AGN has recently emerged from its dusty shroud,\nand now potentially dominates the dust heating, even for the warm dust component. The\nquestion of the relative contribution of star formation and the AGN to the heating of the\nwarm dust that produces the observed (rest frame) FIR excesses, will be discussed in detail\nin Wang et al. (2007b), and can be addressed through the observations suggested below.\nOne outstanding issue the Li et al. models do not address is the early formation of\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\ndust. Such early dust formation remains a puzzle, since the standard ISM dust formation\nmechanism, ie. in the cool winds from evolved low mass (AGB) stars, may require timescales\nlonger than the age of the universe at z \u223c 6. One possible solution is dust formation\nassociated with massive star formation (Stratta et al. 2007; Maiolino et al. 2004; Venkatesan,\nNath, & Shull 2006; Dwek et al. 2007).\nSuch early coeval formation of galaxies and SMBHs has interesting implications on the\ninterpretation of the cosmic Stromgren spheres around high redshift quasars, as inferred from\nthe Gunn-Peterson absorption spectra (Fan et al. 2006b). Masseli et al. (2007) and Lidz et\nal. (2007) point out that, over the lifetime of the system, the integrated star formation and\nAGN emission may contribute roughly equally to the reionization of the regions immediately\nsurrounding the quasar host galaxy.\nThe detection of the gas reservoir required to fuel star formation in the J0927+2001\nquasar host galaxy is a key step in studying the formation of massive galaxies at very high\nredshift, but clearly further detailed observations are required to probe the host galaxy and\nSMBH formation in this system. Critical diagnostic observations include: imaging of the\nCO dynamics to constrain the galaxy gravitational mass, and hence the black hole mass \u2013\nbulge mass relation at high z (Shields et al. 2006; Walter et al. 2004), multiwavelength\nimaging of the dust to help constrain dust heating mechanisms, studies of lower order CO\nlines to determine gas excitation and total gas mass (Bertoldi et al. 2004), detection of higher\ndensity gas tracers, such as HCN, to determine the total mass of gas directly associated with\nstar forming clouds (Gao et al. 2007; Krumholz & Thompson 2007), and detection of the\ninterstellar gas cooling lines, such as [CII] (Maiolino et al. 2005; Iono et al. 2006). The CO\ndetection presented herein provides an accurate redshift for the host galaxy as well as direct\nevidence for a highly developed ISM, and hence is the first crucial step for future studies. For\nextreme luminosity objects such as 0927+2001, many of these studies can be performed with\nlong integration times on current instruments, such as the Plateau de Bure Interferometer\nand Very Large Array. It will take the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, with its more than\nan order of magnitude increase in sensitivity relative to current millimeter interferometers,\nto perform similar studies on less extreme systems, such as the Ly-\u03b1 galaxies at z \u223c 6.\nThe Plateau de Bure Interferometer is a facility of IRAM, supported by INSU/CNRS\n(France), MPG (Germany), and IGN (Spain).
