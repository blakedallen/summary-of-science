N. Friedel1 and S. L. Widicus Weaver2\nABSTRACT\nRecent interferometric observations have called into question the traditional\nview of the Orion-KL region, which displays one of the most well-defined cases of\nchemical differentiation in a star-forming region. Previous, lower-resolution images of Orion-KL show emission signatures for oxygen-bearing organic molecules\ntoward the Orion Compact Ridge, and emission for nitrogen-bearing organic\nmolecules toward the Orion Hot Core. However, more recent observations at\nhigher spatial resolution indicate that the bulk of the molecular emission is arising from many smaller, compact clumps that are spatially distinct from the\ntraditional Hot Core and Compact Ridge sources. It is this type of observational\ninformation that is critical for guiding astrochemical models, as the spatial distribution of molecules and their relation to energetic sources will govern the\nchemical mechanisms at play in star-forming regions. We have conducted millimeter imaging studies of Orion-KL with various beam sizes using CARMA in\norder to investigate the continuum structure. These \u03bb=3mm observations have\nsynthesized beam sizes of \u223c 0.5\u2032\u2032 \u2212 5.0\u2032\u2032 . These observations reveal the complex continuum structure of this region, which stands in sharp contrast to the\nprevious structural models assumed for Orion-KL based on lower spatial resolution images. The new results indicate that the spatial scaling previously used in\ndetermination of molecular abundances for this region are in need of complete\nrevision. Here we present the results of the continuum observations, discuss the\nsizes and structures of the detected sources, and suggest an observational strategy for determining the proper spatial scaling to accurately determine molecular\nabundances in the Orion-KL region.\nSubject headings: astrochemistry-ISM: individual objects (Orion-KL)-radio\ncontinuum: ISM\n1\n\nDepartment of Astronomy, 1002 W.

There are several cloud components (e.g. Hot Core, Compact Ridge,\nextended ridge, and plateau) that are associated with Orion-KL, and these sources have\nvarying chemical and physical properties (e.g. Blake et al. 1987). The most chemically-rich\ncomponents, including the Hot Core, IRc7, IRc6, and IRc5, are separated by less than \u223c4000\nAU (projected on the sky). Emission lines from large oxygen-bearing species (e.g. methyl\nformate [HCOOCH3 ] and dimethyl ether [(CH3 )2 O]) have been observed primarily toward\nIRc5 and IRc5 in the Compact Ridge, while emission from large nitrogen-bearing species\n(e.g. ethyl cyanide [C2 H5 CN]) is observed toward the Hot Core and IRc7 (Friedel & Snyder\n2008).\nThe chemical pathways leading to the formation of complex organic molecules in regions\nsuch as Orion-KL are very poorly understood (e.g Quan & Herbst 2007). It was once assumed that gas-phase ion-molecule reactions in hot cores drive most of the organic chemistry\nobserved in interstellar clouds, but it has since been shown that such reactions are inefficient for producing many of the most highly-abundant molecules observed in these regions\n(Garrod, Widicus Weaver, & Herbst 2008). Instead, it is thought that energetic processing\nof interstellar ices is a likely driving force that dramatically influences interstellar chemistry\n(Garrod, Widicus Weaver, & Herbst 2008; Laas et al. 2011). The spatial distribution of a\ngiven molecular species relative to the position of energetic sources (i.e. shock fronts, photodissociation regions, stellar objects, etc.) might offer clues to the processes that drive its\nformation. Previous interferometric observations of Orion-KL (see Liu et al. (2002) for an\nexample) used older generation interferometers that provided insufficient spatial resolution to\ndistinguish these individual regions and pinpoint possible correlations between a particular\nmolecule and any given source. Friedel & Snyder (2008) reported higher spatial resolution\nobservations of several organic molecules toward Orion-KL at \u03bb = 1 mm. The results of\nthese observations indicate a relationship between the type of physical environment and the\nchemistry observed in Orion-KL. Other recent observations targeting methyl formate at a\nsimilar spatial resolution reveal a highly complicated source structure (Favre et al. 2011).\nThese recent results warrant further investigation at even higher spatial resolution.\nTo this end, we have carried out interferometric observations at the Combined Array\nfor Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (CARMA) over a range of spatial resolutions\ntoward Orion-KL to more fully investigate the spatial extent of molecules in the region.\nThese observations targeted specific emission lines of several complex organic molecules.\nContinuum observations at \u03bb = 3 mm were conducted to explore source structure and size.\nBelow we overview these observations, present the continuum images at several beam sizes,\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nand discuss the implications of these results for the standard spatial models assumed when\ndetermining molecular abundances for the Orion-KL region.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nThe observations were conducted in 2007 December, 2008 July, 2009 January, and 2010\nApril with the CARMA observatory in its B, D, A, and C configurations, respectively.\nThese observations included two 7 hour tracks in B configuration, one 6 hour track in D\nconfiguration, four 5-6 hour tracks in A configuration, and three 4.5 hour tracks in C configuration. The observations have a phase center of \u03b1(J2000) = 05h 35m 14s .35 and \u03b4(J2000) =\n\u221205\u25e6 22\u2032 35\u2032\u2032 .0. The typical synthesized beams are \u223c 5.9\u2032\u2032 \u00d74.8\u2032\u2032 (D configuration), \u223c 2.2\u00d72.0\u2032\u2032\n(C configuration), \u223c 1.1\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.9\u2032\u2032 (B configuration), and \u223c 0.4 \u00d7 0.35\u2032\u2032 (A configuration). The\nu \u2212 v coverage of the observations gives projected baselines of 3.0-35.3 k\u03bb (10-118 m, D\nconfiguration), 3.9-91.0 k\u03bb (13-304 m, C configuration), 21.8-257.5 k\u03bb (73-860 m, B configuration), and 38.0-467.2 k\u03bb (127-1560 m, A configuration). By observing over such a wide\nrange of u \u2212 v coverage, only structures larger than \u223c30 arcseconds are resolved out. Each\narcsecond is equivalent to \u223c414 AU at the distance of Orion-KL.\nThe correlator was configured with six 31 MHz wide windows for continuum and spectral\nlines (three in each sideband) for the observations conducted in the B and D configurations.\nEach window had 63 channels with a channel spacing of 488 kHz (\u223c1.4 km s\u22121 ). The\ncontinuum images were constructed from both line-free windows and windows containing\nflagged lines. Uranus and Mars were used as flux density calibrators, and 0541-056 was used\nto calibrate the antenna-based gains. For two of the A configuration tracks, the correlator\nwas configured with four 31 MHz wide windows and two 500 MHz wide windows (three in\neach sideband). The correlator configuration for the third A configuration track was two 31\nMHz bands and four 500 MHz bands, while the fourth track was configured with four 31\nMHz bands and two 62 MHz bands. The antenna-based gain calibration was done by selfcalibrating on the SiO maser in source I at 86.243 GHz. The solution was then bootstrapped\nto the other bands. Phase offsets between each band and the SiO band were calculated and\nremoved by using observations of 0607-085. As all available flux calibrators were heavily\nresolved in A configuration, the amplitude gains were calculated by comparing previously\nmeasured fluxes of 0607-085 with these observations. The absolute amplitude calibrations\nof 0541-056 and 0607-085 are accurate to within \u223c20%. The internal noise source was used\nto correct the passbands of each 31 MHz window, and observations of 0423-013 were used to\ncorrect the passbands of the 500 and 62 MHz windows. The data were calibrated, continuum\nsubtracted, and imaged using the MIRIAD software package (Sault et al. 1995). Note that\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nthe flux of the point source BN (see \u00a73) is similar across all array configurations, indicating\nthat the accuracy of the absolute flux calibration between the different tracks is better than\n95%.\n\n3.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nFigure 1 shows the \u03bb = 3 mm continuum of Orion-KL from the A, B, C, and D array\nconfiguration observations. The noise levels are 290 \u03bcJy bm\u22121 , 2.4 mJy bm\u22121 , 2.2 mJy bm\u22121 ,\nand 1.8 mJy bm\u22121 , respectively, and the synthesized beams for each array configuration are\nshown in the lower left corner of each panel. The large scale structures seen in the 5\u2032\u2032\nresolution observations are resolved into several dozen sources as the beam area decreases\nby two orders of magnitude. The strongest emission peak in the A and B configuration\nmaps arises from source BN, whereas the peak of the emission in the C and D configuration\nmaps is closely associated with the Hot Core. This indicates that, while there are numerous\nindividual sources, the bulk of the continuum emission is coming from more extended regions.\nFigure 2 shows a portion of the \u03bb=3 mm B configuration continuum (contours) overlaid\non a gray scale Hubble NICMOS 2 \u03bcm image1 of the same region. Sources of interest have\nbeen labeled for reference. Most of the millimeter continuum emission does not coincide\nwith infrared active regions, but appears to be anti-correlated with most of the sources; the\nprimary exception to this trend is source BN. Here we provide brief descriptions of previously\nidentified infrared and millimeter sources of interest:\nBN A star with the highest \u03bb = 3 mm point source flux in the region (89 mJy bm\u22121 ). This\nsource is also very bright in the infrared (see Figure 2).\nHot Core/I A site of high-mass star formation that is the traditional location of N-bearing\nmolecules. Source I (\u223c0.5\u2032\u2032 south of the hot core) is located at the center of the SiO\nmasers (Menten & Reid 1995).\nCompact Ridge A region of stellar outflow interacting with the ambient cloud. This source\nis the traditional location of O-bearing molecules in the region. Friedel & Snyder (2008)\nnoted that most of the compact emission comes from other sources. No continuum\nemission above the 3-\u03c3 level was detected from this region in any of our observations.\n1\n\nBased on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data\narchive at the Space Telescope Science Institute.

There\nis also a NH3 peak, indicating a high (> 107 cm\u22123 ) density (Migenes et al. 1989). Weak\nemission (\u223c10 mJy bm\u22121 ) is seen toward this source in the B configuration results.\np A star which is detected both in the infrared and optical (Simpson et al. 2006), with no\ndetected \u03bb = 3 mm continuum.\nk A star which is detected both in the infrared and optical (Simpson et al. 2006), with no\ndetected \u03bb = 3 mm continuum.\nv A star which is detected both in the infrared and optical (Simpson et al. 2006), with no\ndetected \u03bb = 3 mm continuum.\nIRc3, 4 & 5 These are objects thought to be reflection nebulae being illuminated by IRc2\n(nearly coincident with source I) (Simpson et al. 2006). There is no significant NH3\nemission seen toward any of these sources (Migenes et al. 1989). There is no detected\ncontinuum emission above 3 \u03c3 toward IRc3, while a weak \u223c9 mJy bm\u22121 peak is detected\ntoward IRc4. An apparent double-lobed continuum emission peak is centered in close\nproximity to IRc5.\nIRc6 There is notable \u03bb=3 mm continuum emission coming from the region between IRc3\nand IRc6. Friedel & Snyder (2008) also detected notable \u03bb = 1 mm continuum from\nthis region.\nIRc7 This source is thought to contain an embedded YSO (Simpson et al. 2006) and has a\nstrong NH3 peak, indicating high density (Migenes et al. 1989). However, there is no\ndetected continuum emission above 3 \u03c3. Friedel & Snyder (2008) reported weak \u03bb =\n1 mm continuum from this source.\nIRc20 Little is known of this object because of its weak emission and proximity to the very\nbright BN emission.\nCB4 A binary with no detected \u03bb = 3 mm continuum.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Continuum maps of Orion-KL at \u03bb = 3 mm. a) CARMA A configuration map,\nwith contours at \u00b112\u03c3, \u00b118\u03c3, \u00b124\u03c3, ...

Any source\nnot listed below was only detected by the A configuration observations, indicating it is a\nlone point-like source, or that it has a surrounding envelope below our detection threshold.\nC1 & C2 Both of these sources appear to be embedded in an extended envelope, on the\norder of \u223c 10\u2032\u2032 , with the bulk of the flux surrounding C1. A third of the flux is resolved\nout by a 2\u2032\u2032 beam, and a total of 63% is resolved out by the subarcsecond beam.\nC4 This continuum source appears to be a single point source embedded in a surrounding\nenvelope several arcseconds in diameter, which emits 75% of the flux. This source\nwas undetected in the D configuration observations due to its proximity to the large\nnegative sidelobes of the main continuum sources.\nC7 This source appears to bridge the gap between C1/C2 and the Hot Core region, and\nlittle flux is lost with a 2\u2032\u2032 beam. However, 93% of the flux is lost with the subarcsecond\nA configuration beam, indicating that the small C7 source is surrounded by a large\u223c\n12\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 4\u2032\u2032 envelope.\nC10 This source is detected with the \u223c2\u2032\u2032 C configuration beam with a source size of \u223c\n2\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 7\u2032\u2032 , however there is no flux lost when observing with a subarcsecond beam,\nindicating that the near point source may be embedded in a very diffuse envelope.\nC11 This source is BN and is expected to be a point source, as can be seen by the fact that\nthere is no flux lost from the lowest to highest resolution observations.\nC13 & C14 These sources could not be individually resolved from surrounding sources in\nall but the A configuration, and so no additional properties can be inferred.\nC15 & C16 Both of these sources appear to be embedded in an extended envelope, on the\norder of \u223c 5\u2032\u2032 . Over half of the flux is resolved out by a 2\u2032\u2032 beam, and a total of \u223c80%\nis resolved out by the subarcsecond beam.\nC17 - C22 The individual sources could not be fully resolved by all but the highest resolution observations. Table 2 gives the fitted parameters for the B and C configurations,\nhowever the errors are large due to source blending. The total flux of the complex\n(given in the last line of Table 2) shows that there is a notable large envelope surrounding all of the sources, over half of which is resolved out when observed with\na \u223c2\u2032\u2032 beam, and 82% of which is resolved out by the subarcsecond A configuration\nbeam.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nC23 This source, like many others, appears to be a near point source embedded in a surrounding envelope of a few arcseconds in size which produces nearly three quarters of\nthe continuum flux.\nC24 This source appears to be a point source with no surrounding envelope in all array\nconfigurations.\nC28 The fit for this source from the A configuration data is poor, but based on the map\nflux it appears to be a point source with a minimal surrounding envelope.\nC29 This source has notable extended flux, 75% of which is resolved out by a \u223c2\u2032\u2032 beam.\nIn the B configuration data this source appears as two distinct sources on either side\nof IRc5, only one of which is detected by the subarcsecond beam.\nC30 This source was detected with all four array configurations but could not be resolved\nfor fitting in the D configuration data. It appears to be a small source embedded in a\nweakly emitting surrounding envelope.\nC32 This source was only detected in the C configuration and in the convolved A configuration data, indicating that it is a small source with a surrounding envelope that is\nbelow the detection threshold of the D and B configuration observations.\nC33 & C34 These sources were only detected in the B configuration and appear to be\nsmall, but larger than point-like sources.\nA standard rule-of-thumb with molecular line observations in Orion-KL, based on the\nimages presented by Liu et al. (2002), has been to assume a \u223c5\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032\u2032 spherical source structure for the Orion Hot Core, and an elongated \u223c5\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 10\u2032\u2032 oval source structure for the Compact Ridge. The results from the present work call into question this standard spatial model\nused to interpret Orion-KL molecular observations. These observations reveal that the Orion\nHot Core and Compact Ridge are comprised of many bright but compact continuum sources\nthat have not been spatially resolved in previous interferometric studies. These point sources\nare interspersed with regions of extended emission that are directly correlated with sources\nof heating and/or shocks. Given the complexity of the continuum morphology in this region,\nit is likely that the spatial distribution of molecular line emission will be similarly complex.\nFurther evidence of this complex source morphology is shown in Figure 5, which compares the\ncontinuum images derived from this work to the molecular line images of Friedel & Snyder\n(2008). The gray scale traces the uniformly weighted continuum (logarithmically scaled to\nshow the weaker features in this high dynamic range image), the green contours trace ethyl\ncyanide [C2 H5 CN], the red contours trace dimethyl ether [(CH3 )2 O], and the blue contours\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\ntrace acetone [(CH3 )2 CO]. This comparison reveals that significant source structure remains\nunresolved even with the 1\u2032\u2032 beam used in the Friedel & Snyder (2008) observations. This\ncomparison also reveals that the continuum emission and molecular emission do not always\nnecessarily trace the same source morphology. We conclude from this comparison that only\ndirect, high spatial resolution observations for each individual molecule can be used to determine the true source morphology for that particular molecule. This information can then\nbe used to accurately determine molecular abundances in the Orion-KL region.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Molecular emission contours from (Friedel & Snyder 2008) overlaid on the gray\nscale continuum (uniformly weighted map). The continuum has been logarithmically scaled\nto show the weaker features in this high dynamic range image. The green contours are ethyl\ncyanide [C2 H5 CN], red contours are dimethyl ether [(CH3 )2 O], and the blue contours are\nacetone [(CH3 )2 CO].\n4.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have conducted extensive \u03bb = 3 mm continuum observations of the Orion-KL star\nforming region. These observations used the CARMA Array in four different array configurations to fully sample this region at varying spatial resolutions (\u223c0.5\u2032\u2032 - 5\u2032\u2032 beams). It is\napparent from these observations that the spatial distribution of the continuum in the Orion-\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nKL region is much more complicated than has previously been considered. In the past it\nhas been routine to assume that there were two main sources of continuum in Orion-KL: the\nHot Core/source I, and source BN. In light of the results from the continuum observations\nreported here, this simplistic view of the Orion-KL structure must be revised. These observations show that these sources are comprised of nearly three dozen individual continuum\nsources, many of which appear to be point-like sources surrounded by extended envelopes. It\nwould not be surprising for future higher spatial resolution observations to detect even more\nsmall continuum sources in the region. Comparison of these continuum maps to molecular\nmaps from Friedel & Snyder (2008) reveal that high spatial resolution studies are required\nfor each molecule detected in the Orion-KL region before a proper source structure model\ncan be determined. Such studies will allow for more accurate determination of molecular\nabundances in the Orion-KL region.\nWe would like to thank an anonymous referee for their helpful comments.
