Introduction\nRecently, there has been increasing interest and considerable activity in the study of higherdimensional space-times with large extra dimensions [1, 2, 3]. Suggestions that extra dimensions may not be compact [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] or large [1, 9] can provide new insights for\nthe solution of some relevant problems of high\u2013energy physics such as the mass hierarchy\nproblem, dark matter, non\u2013locality and the cosmological constant [5, 8, 10]. In the framework of brane scenarios, an important ingredient is that gravity is free to propagate in all\ndimensions, whereas all the matter fields are confined to a 3\u2013brane with no contradiction\nwith present time gravitational experiments [1, 5, 7, 11, 12].\nIn the brane world scenario, an important question is how to realize the brane world\nidea, in which a key ingredient is localization of various bulk fields on a brane by a natural\nmechanism. It is well known that the massless scalar field [13] and the graviton [2] are\nlocalized on branes of different types, and that the spin 1 Abelian vector fields can not\nbe localized on the Randall-Sundrum(RS) model in five dimensions but can be localized\nin some higher-dimensional cases [14]. For fermions, they do not have normalizable zero\nmodes in five and six dimensions [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Meanwhile, for the brane\nwith inclusion of scalar backgrounds [20] and minimal gauged supergravity [21] in higher\ndimensions, localized chiral fermions can be obtained under some conditions.\nRecently, thick brane scenarios based on gravity coupled to scalars have been constructed [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. An interesting feature of these models is that one can obtain\nbranes naturally without introducing them by hand in the action of the theory [22]. Furthermore, these scalar fields do not play the role of bulk fields but provide the \"material\"\nfrom which the thick branes are made of. By considering a non-Riemannian modification of 5-dimensional Kaluza\u2013Klein (KK) theory (in a pure geometric Weyl integrable\n5-dimensional space time), the generalized models based on gravity coupled to scalars have\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fbeen studied in Refs. [27, 28, 29]. In this scenario, spacetime structures with pure geometric thick smooth branes separated in the extra dimension arise. The authors obtained a\nsingle bound state which represents a stable 4D graviton and proved that the spectrum of\nmassive modes of KK excitations is not discrete or quantized at all, but continuous without\nmass gap due to the asymptotic behavior of the quantum mechanics potential [28, 29]. This\ngives an very important conclusion: the claim that Weylian structures mimic classically\nquantum behavior does not constitute a generic feature of these geometric manifolds [28].\nThe aim of the present article is to investigate localization of various matters on the\npure geometrical thick branes obtained in Refs. [27, 28, 29]. The paper is organized as\nfollows: In section 2, we first give a review of the thick branes arising from a pure geometric\nWeyl integrable 5-dimensional space time, which is a non-Riemannian modification of 5dimensional KK theory. Then, in section 3, we study localization of various matters on the\npure geometrical thick branes in 5 dimensions. Finally, a brief conclusion and discussion\nare presented.\n\n2. Review of thick brane worlds arising from pure geometry\nLet us start with a non\u2013Riemannian generalization of KK theory, i.e., a pure geometrical\nWeyl action in five dimensions\nS5W\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nM5W\n\n\u221a\ni\nd5 x \u2212g 3 \u03c9 h\ne 2 R + 3\u03be\u0303(\u2207\u03c9)2 + 6U (\u03c9) ,\n16\u03c0G5\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere M5W is a 5-dimensional Weyl-integrable manifold specified by the pair (gM N , \u03c9),\ngM N is a 5-dimensional metric and \u03c9 is a Weyl scalar function. In such manifolds the\nQ\nP\nWeylian Ricci tensor is given by RM N = \u0393PM N,P \u2212 \u0393PP M,N + \u0393PM N \u0393Q\nP Q \u2212 \u0393M Q \u0393N P , with\nP\nP + \u03c9 \u03b4P \u2212 g\n,P\nW\n\u0393PM N = {MPN }\u2212 21 (\u03c9,M \u03b4N\n,N M\nM N \u03c9 ) the affine connections on M5 and {M N } the\nChristoffel symbols. The parameter \u03be \u0303 is a coupling constant, and U (\u03c9) is a self-interaction\npotential for \u03c9, which, in general, breaks the invariance of the action (2.1) under Weyl\nrescaling,\ngM N \u2192 \u03a9\u22122 gM N ,\n\n \u0303 + \u2202\u03c9 ln \u03a92 )2 ,\n\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9 + ln \u03a92 , \u03be\u0303 \u2192 \u03be/(1\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere \u03a92 is a smooth function on M5W . U (\u03c9) = \u03bb e\u03c9 , where \u03bb is a constant parameter,\nis the only functional form which preserves the scale invariance of the Weyl action (2.1).\nWhen the Weyl invariance is broken, the scalar field transforms from a geometrical object\ninto an observable degree of freedom which generates the smooth thick brane configurations,\nnamely, \u03c9 is not a bulk field playing the role of the modulus for the extra dimension. The\nWeyl action is of pure geometrical nature since the scalar field \u03c9 enters in the definition of\nthe affine connections of the Weyl manifold.\nThe ansatz for the line-element which results in a 4-dimensional Poincar\u00e9 invariance\nof the Weyl action (2.1) is given by\nds25 = e2A(y) \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + dy 2 ,\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fwhere e2A(y) is the warp factor, and y stands for the extra coordinate.\nIn search of a solution to the setup defined by (2.1) and (2.3), we shall use the conformal\ntechnique. Via a conformal transformation, \u011dM N = e\u03c9 gM N , we go from the Weyl frame to\nthe Riemann one, M5W \u2192 M5R . The action (2.1) is mapped into the following Riemannian\nform\n\u221a\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u0010 \u00112\nd5 x \u2212\u011d\nR\n\u02c6\nR\u0302 + 3\u03be \u2207\u03c9 + 6\u00db (\u03c9) ,\n(2.4)\nS5 =\nM5R 16\u03c0G5\n\nwhere \u03be = \u03be\u0303 \u2212 1, \u00db (\u03c9) = e\u2212\u03c9 U (\u03c9). Thus, in this frame, we have a theory which describes\n5\u2013dimensional gravity coupled to a scalar field with a self\u2013interaction potential. After this\ntransformation, the line element reads\nd\u015d25 = e2\u03c3(y) \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + e\u03c9(y) dy 2 ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere 2\u03c3 = 2A + \u03c9. If we introduce a new pair of variables X \u2261 \u03c9 \u2032 and Y \u2261 2A\u2032 , then the\nfield equations that are derivable from (2.4) with the ansatz (2.5) reduce to the following\npair of coupled equations\n3\n1 d\u00db \u03c9\nX \u2032 + 2Y X + X 2 =\ne ,\n2\n\u03be d\u03c9\n3\nY \u2032 + XY + 2Y 2 =\n2\n\n4\u00db \u2212\n\n1 d\u00db\n\u03be d\u03c9\n\n(2.6)\n!\n\ne\u03c9 .\n\n(2.7)\n\nAs pointed out in [27], this system of equations can be easily solved if one uses the restriction\nX = kY , where k is an arbitrary constant parameter which is not allowed to adopt the value\nk = \u22121 because the system would be incompatible. This condition leads to a Riemannian\n4k\u03be\npotential of the form \u00db = \u03bbe 1+k \u03c9 . It turns out that this constrain leads to the following\nsimple brane configurations:\nConfiguration 1: Z2 \u2013symmetric thick brane\nIn this case, \u2212\u221e < y < +\u221e (we recall that, due to orbifold symmetry of the solution, only\none half of the extra dimension, say 0 \u2264 y < +\u221e, is physically relevant). The expressions\nfor the warp factor and the scalar field read [27]\ne2A(y) = [cosh(ay)]b , \u03c9 = kb ln cosh(ay).\nwhere\na=\n\nr\n\n4 + 3k\n2\u03bb,\n1+k\n\nb=\n\n2\n,\n4 + 3k\n\n(2.8)\n\n(2.9)\n\nand\n\u03bb > 0,\n\nk < \u22124/3.\n\n(2.10)\n\nHence, b is negative and the warp factor is concentrated near of the origin y = 0. The\nenergy density of the scalar matter is [28]\n\u0015\n\u0014\nb ay\n3a2 b ay\n\u2212ay 2\n\u2212ay b\u22122\n(e + e )\n(2.11)\n1 + (e \u2212 e ) .\n\u03bc(y) = \u2212\n4\u03c0G5\n4\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fThis function has two negative minima and a positive maximum at y = 0 between them\nat some y 6= 0, and finally it vanishes asymptotically (see Fig. 1).\n\n\u039c\n3\n2\n1\n-20\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n20\n\ny\n\n-1\nFigure 1: The shape of the energy density function with k = \u22125/3 and \u03bb = 0.01. A thick brane\nwith positive energy density is centered at the origin y = 0.\n\nConfiguration 2: non Z2 \u2013symmetric thick brane\nThe non Z2 \u2013symmetric thick brane solution was found by Barbosa-Cendejas and HerreraAguilar [28]\nh\n\u0001kb i\n\u0001b\n,\n(2.12)\ne2A(y) = k3 eay + k1 e\u2212ay , \u03c9 = ln k2 eay + k1 e\u2212ay\n\nwhere k2 and k3 are arbitrary constants, and\n\u03bb > 0,\n\nk < \u22124/3,\n\nk1 > 0.\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe Z2 \u2013symmetric solution (2.8) is the particular case of this solution with k1 = 1, k2 =\n2\u2212kb and k3 = 2\u2212b . The parameter k1 represents the Z2 \u2013asymmetry of the solution through\na shift along the extra coordinate. This has a quite important physical implication, i.e.,\nthe space time is not restricted to be an orbifold geometry, it allows for a more general\ntype of manifolds.\nThe 5\u2013dimensional curvature scalar in the Riemann frame and in the Weyl frame are\n[28]\n\u0014\n\u0015\nb(5 + 3k) ay\n\u221264\u03bbk1 (1 + k) ay\n\u2212ay \u2212(kb+2)\n\u2212ay 2\n(e + k1 e )\n(e \u2212 k1 e )\n1+\n(2.14)\nR\u03025 =\n1\u2212k\n16k1\nand\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n5b ay\n\u221216a2 bk1\n\u2212ay 2\n(e \u2212 k1 e ) ,\n1+\nR5 = ay\n(e + k1 e\u2212ay )2\n16k1\n\n(2.15)\n\nrespectively.

So, It represents a thick brane with positive energy density\ncentered at y = c2 .\nThese solutions would be utilized to analyze localization of various matter fields on\npure geometrical thick branes in the next section.\n\n3. Localization of various matters\nNow, we ask the question of whether various bulk fields with spin ranging from 0 to 1 can\nbe localized on thick branes by means of only the gravitational interaction. Of course, we\nhave implicitly assumed that various bulk fields considered below make little contribution\nto the bulk energy so that the solutions given in previous section remain valid even in the\npresence of bulk fields. The metric is given by (2.3), but it is more convenient to change it\nto a conformally flat metric as\n\u0001\nds25 = e2A \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + dz 2 ,\n(3.1)\nin which the relation of the new coordinate z and y is dz = e\u2212A(y) dy.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\f3.1 Spin 0 scalar field\nIn this subsection we study localization of a real scalar field on pure geometrical thick\nbranes in the backgrounds (2.8)-(2.16). Let us consider the action of a massless real scalar\ncoupled to gravity\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n(3.2)\nS0 = \u2212\nd5 x \u2212g gM N \u2202M \u03a6\u2202N \u03a6,\n2\nfrom which the equation of motion can be derived\n\u221a\n1\n\u221a \u2202M ( \u2212gg M N \u2202N \u03a6) = 0.\n\u2212g\n\n(3.3)\n\nBy considering the the conformally flat metric (3.1) the equation of motion (3.3) becomes\n\u0001\n\u2202z2 + 3(\u2202z A)\u2202z + \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u03a6 = 0.\n\n(3.4)\n\nWith the decomposition\n\n\u03a6(x, z) = \u03c6(x)\u03c7(z),\n\n(3.5)\n\nand demanding \u03c6(x) satisfies the 4-dimensional massive Klein\u2013Gordon equation (\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u2212\nm2 )\u03c6(x) = 0, we obtain the equation for \u03c7(z)\n\u0001\n\u2202z2 + 3(\u2202z A)\u2202z + m2 \u03c7(z) = 0.\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe 5-dimensional action (3.2) reduces to the standard 4-dimensional action for the massive\nscalars, when integrated over the extra dimension under the conditions that Eq. (3.6) is\nsatisfied and the normalization condition\nZ \u221e\ndz e3A \u03c72 (z) = 1\n(3.7)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nis obeyed.\n3\nIn order to obtain the Schr\u00f6dinger-like equation, we define \u03c7\ne(z) = e 2 A \u03c7(z) and get\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\u2212\u2202z2 + V (z) \u03c7\ne(z) = m2 \u03c7\ne(z),\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the KK excitation and the potential is given by\n3\n9\nV (z) = \u2202z2 A + (\u2202z A)2 .\n2\n4\n\n(3.9)\n\nThe potential depends only on the warp factor exponent A and has the same form as the\ncase of graviton. For the first and second brane configurations there is a particular case\nk = \u22125/3 for which one can invert the coordinate transformation dz = e\u2212A(y) dy. For the\nthird brane configuration there are two particular cases (p = \u22121/4 and p = \u22123/4). In\nthese cases we can explicitly express y in terms of z. Here we only consider the first brane\nconfiguration (2.8), the cases of the other types are similar. For the first case, by taking\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fk = \u22125/3, the expression of y is y = arcsinh(az)/a, and the effective potential is reduced\nto\n9\u03bb(15\u03bbz 2 \u2212 2)\n.\n4(3\u03bbz 2 + 1)2\n\nV (z) =\n\n(3.10)\n\nThis potential has the asymptotic behavior: V (z = \u00b1\u221e) = 0 and V (z = 0) = \u22129\u03bb/2.\nThis in fact is a volcano type potential [30, 31]. This means that the potential provides no\nmass gap to separate the scalar zero mode from KK modes. When \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, this potential\ntends to the singular one found in the RS scenario [2]. The shape of the above potential is\nshown in Fig. 3. For the zero mode m2 = 0, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (3.6) can be solved.\nThe only normalizable eigenfunction is turned out to be\n\u03c7\ne0 (z) =\n\nN1\n,\n+ 1)3/4\n\n(3.11)\n\n(3\u03bbz 2\n\n\u221a\nwhere N1 = (3\u03bb)1/4 / 2 is a normalization constant. This function represents the lowest\nenergy eigenfunction of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (3.8) since it has no zeros. In fact, the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation (3.8) can be written as H \u03c7\ne = m2 \u03c7\ne [22, 23, 24], where the Hamiltonian\n\u2020\noperator is given by H = Q Q with Q = \u2212\u2202z + (3/2)\u2202z \u03c3. Since the operator H is positive\ndefinite, there are no normalizable modes with negative m2 , namely, there is no tachyonic\nscalar mode. Thus the scalar zero mode is the lowest mode in the spectrum. In addition\nto this massless mode, the potential (3.10) suggest that there exists a continuum gapless\nspectrum of KK modes with positive m2 > 0, which are similar to those obtained in Refs.\n[3, 22, 23].\n~\n\nVHzL and \u03a70 HzL\n0.5\n0.25\n-10\n\n-5\n\n5\n\n10\n\nz\n\n-0.25\n-0.5\n-0.75\n-1\n\nFigure 3: The shape of the effective potential V (z) (thick line) and zero mode \u03c7\ne0 (z) (thin line)\nfor scalars.

Here we consider the action of U (1) vector field\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nd5 x \u2212gg M N g RS FM R FN S ,\n(3.12)\nS1 = \u2212\n4\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fwhere FM N = \u2202M AN \u2212 \u2202N AM as usual. From this action the equation motion is given by\n\u221a\n1\n\u221a \u2202M ( \u2212gg M N gRS FN S ) = 0.\n\u2212g\n\n(3.13)\n\nFrom the background geometry (3.1), this equation is reduced to\n\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc F\u03bd4 = 0,\n\n(3.14)\n\n\u2202 F\u03bc\u03bd + (\u2202z + \u2202z A) F4\u03bd = 0.\n\n(3.15)\n\n\u03bc\n\nWe assume that the A\u03bc are Z2 -even and that A4 is Z2 -odd with respect to the extra dimension z, which results in that A4 has no zero mode in the effective 4D theory. Furthermore,\nH\nin order to consistent with the gauge invariant equation dzA4 = 0, we use gauge freedom\nto choose A4 = 0. Under these assumption, the action (3.12) is reduced to\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0001\u0011\n1\nS1 = \u2212\n(3.16)\nd4 xdz eA \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bb \u03b7 \u03bd\u03c1 F\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bb\u03c1 \u2212 2\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd A\u03bc \u2202z eA \u2202z A\u03bd .\n4\nBy decomposing the vector field as\n\nA\u03bc (x, z) = a\u03bc (x)\u03c1(z),\nand importing the normalization condition\nZ \u221e\ndz eA \u03c12 (z) = 1,\n\n(3.17)\n\n(3.18)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nthe action (3.16) is read\nS1 =\n\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1 2 \u03bc\u03bd\n1 \u03bc\u03bb \u03bd\u03c1\nd x \u2212 \u03b7 \u03b7 f\u03bc\u03bd f\u03bb\u03c1 \u2212 m \u03b7 a\u03bc a\u03bd ,\n4\n2\n4\n\n(3.19)\n\nwhere f\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc a\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd a\u03bc is the 4-dimensional field strength tensor, and we have required\nthat the \u03c1(z) satisfy the differential equation\n(\u2202z2 + (\u2202z A)\u2202z + m2 )\u03c1(z) = 0.\nFor massive vectors, by defining \u03c1e = eA/2 \u03c1, Eq. (3.20) changes into\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\u2212\u2202z2 + V (z) \u03c1e(z) = m2 \u03c1e(z),\n\n(3.20)\n\n(3.21)\n\nwhere the potential is given by\n\nV (z) =\n\n1\n1 2\n\u2202z A + (\u2202z A)2 .\n2\n4\n\n(3.22)\n\nFor the first brane configuration, by taking k = \u22125/3, the effective potential is reduced to\nV (z) =\n\n3\u03bb(9\u03bbz 2 \u2212 2)\n.\n4(3\u03bbz 2 + 1)2\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n(3.23)\n\n\fThe potential is very similar to the one given in Eq. (3.10). Hence, we encounter the same\nanalyse. The vector zero mode is turned out to be\n\u03c1e(z) =\n\nN2\n,\n+ 1)1/4\n\n(3\u03bbz 2\n\n(3.24)\n\nwhere N2 is a normalization constant. Now the normalization condition (3.18) is read\nZ \u221e\ndz \u03c1e 2 (z) = 1,\n(3.25)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhich shows that the vector zero mode is non-normalized. It is turned out that the result\nis same as the RS model case, i.e. the zero mode of the spin 1 vector field can not be\nlocalized on the thick brane. It was shown in the RS model in AdS5 space that spin 1\nvector field is not localized neither on a brane with positive tension nor on a brane with\nnegative tension so the Dvali-Shifman mechanism [32] must be considered for the vector\nfield localization [13].\n3.3 Spin 1/2 fermionic field\nLocalization of fermions in general spacetimes has been studied for example in [20]. In\nRef. [33], it was found that fermions can escape into the bulk by tunneling, and the rate\ndepends on the parameters of the scalar field potential. In Ref. [34], Melfo et al studied\nthe localization of fermions on various different scalar thick branes. They showed that\nonly one massless chiral mode is localized in double walls and branes interpolating between\ndifferent AdS5 spacetimes whenever the wall thickness is keep finite, while chiral fermionic\nmodes cannot be localized in dS4 walls embedded in a M5 spacetime. In this subsection\nwe study localization of a spin 1/2 fermionic field on the pure geometrical thick branes.\nLet us consider the Dirac action of a massless spin 1/2 fermion coupled to gravity and\nscalar\nZ\n\u0001\n\u221a\nS1/2 = d5 x \u2212g \u03a8\u0304i\u0393M DM \u03a8 \u2212 \u03b7 \u03a8\u0304F (\u03c9)\u03a8 ,\n(3.26)\n\nfrom which the equation of motion is given by\n\u0002 M\n\u0003\ni\u0393 (\u2202M + \u03c9M ) \u2212 \u03b7F (\u03c9) \u03a8 = 0,\n\n(3.27)\n\nM\u0304 N\u0304 \u0393 \u0393 is the spin connection with M\u0304 , N\u0304 , * * * denoting the local Lorentz\nwhere \u03c9M = 41 \u03c9M\nM\u0304 N\u0304\nM\nindices, \u0393 and \u0393M\u0304 are the curved gamma matrices and the flat gamma ones, respectively,\nand have the relations \u0393M = eM\n\u0393M\u0304 = (e\u2212A \u03b3 \u03bc , \u2212ie\u2212A \u03b3 5 ) with eM\u0304\nM being the vielbein.

Discussions\nIn this paper, we have investigated the possibility of localizing various matter fields on\npure geometrical thick branes, which also localize the graviton, from the viewpoint of field\ntheory. We first give a brief review of several types of thick smooth brane configurations\nin a pure geometric Weyl integrable 5-dimensional space time. Some of these thick branes\nbreak Z2 \u2013symmetry along the extra dimension.\nThen, we check localization of various matter fields on these pure geometrical thick\nbranes from the viewpoint of field theory. For scalars and vectors, the one dimensional\nSchr\u00f6dinger potentials are similar to the case of gravity. They have a finite negative\nwell at the location of the brane and a finite positive barrier at each side which vanishes\nasymptotically. It is shown that there is only a single bound state (zero mode) which is\njust the lowest energy eigenfunction of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the two kinds of fields.\nSince all values of m2 > 0 are allowed, there also exist a continuum gapless spectrum of\nKK states with m2 > 0, which turn asymptotically into continuum plane wave as |z| \u2192 \u221e\n[3, 22, 28, 29]. But the zero mode for spin 1 vector is non-normalized, so vector fields\nare not localized on the branes. For spin 1/2 fermion, it is shown that, for the case of no\nYukawa coupling, there is no bound states for both left and right chiral fermions. Hence,\nfor the massless left or right chiral fermion localization, there must be some kind of Yukawa\ncoupling. These situations can be compared with the case of the domain wall in the RS\nframework [13], where for localization of spin 1/2 field additional localization method by\nJackiw and Rebbi [35] was introduced. In this paper, we consider a special case of coupling\nas an example. With the special coupling, we get a discrete spectrum of KK modes with\npositive m2 > 0. However, it is showed that only one massless chiral mode is localized on\nthe branes.\nLocalizing the fermionic degrees of freedom on branes or defects requires us to introduce other interactions but gravity. Recently, Parameswaran et al studied fluctuations\nabout axisymmetric warped brane solutions in 6-dimensional minimal gauged supergravity\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fand proved that, not only gravity, but Standard Model fields could \"feel\" the extent of\nlarge extra dimensions, and still be described by an effective 4-Dimensional theory [21].\nMoreover, there are some other backgrounds could be considered besides gauge field [36]\nand supergravity [37], for example, vortex background [38, 39]. The topological vortex\ncoupled to fermions may result in chiral fermion zero modes [40]. More recently, Volkas\net al had extensively analyzed localization mechanisms on a domain wall. In particular,\nin Ref. [41], they proposed a well-defined model for localizing the SM, or something close\nto it, on a domain wall brane. Their paper made use of preparatory work done in Refs.\n[42, 43].\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors are really grateful to the referee and the authors of Ref.
