Only one sightline had been measured previously. The\nglobular clusters, S78, S150, S233 and Baade 327 were used as point sources to probe\nthe interstellar dust in M31. The Serkowski law produces good fits for all the sightlines\nalthough the relationship between K and \u03bbmax may be different from that found in the\nGalaxy. The results of this study imply that the slope K/\u03bbmax may be significantly\nlarger in M31. The Serkowski curves are significantly narrower than those of the same\n\u03bbmax in the Galaxy and may require extreme modifications to the size distributions of\nsilicate particles. The fits for the four sightlines reveal values of \u03bbM ax ranging from 4800\nto 5500 \u00c5. These are consistent with average values of \u03bbmax measured in the Galaxy\nand the Magellanic Clouds. The range measured for M31 corresponds to RV values of\n2.7 to 3.1. The range in RV seen in the Galaxy is 2.5 to 5.5 implying, for this small\nsample, that the average size of interstellar grains in M31 is typically smaller than that\nseen for Galactic grains if the nature of the grains is the same. Also, the polarization\nefficiency for these sightlines is large although some bias is expected since sightlines\nknown to have significant interstellar polarization were selected for the sample.\nSubject headings: M31, interstellar dust, polarization\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere is an average Milky Way extinction relation, depending on only one parameter, the ratio\nof total-to-selective extinction, RV , which is applicable to a wide range of interstellar dust environments (Cardelli, Clayton, & Mathis 1989 (CCM)). Similarly, there is an interstellar polarization\n1\n\nA portion of the results presented here made use of the Multiple Mirror Telescope Observatory, a facility operated\njointly by the University of Arizona and the Smithsonian Institution.\n2\n\nDepartment of Physics & Astronomy, Louisiana State University Baton Rouge, LA 70803; email: gclayton@fenway.phys.lsu.edu\n3\n\nSpace Science Institute, 1540 30th Street, Suite 23, Boulder, CO 80303-1012; email: wolff@colorado.edu\n\n4\n\nSteward Observatory, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721; E-mail: kgordon, psmith@as.arizona.edu\n\n5\n\nSpace Astronomy laboratory, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706; email: khn, brian@sal.wisc.edu\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nrelation, correlated with a single parameter, \u03bbmax , the wavelength at which the interstellar polarization is a maximum (Serkowski, Mathewson, & Ford 1975; Clayton et al. 1995; Martin, Clayton,\n& Wolff 1999). The parameters, RV and \u03bbmax , both involve integrals over the size distribution\nof interstellar dust grains and are well correlated with each other (Serkowski et al. 1975; Whittet\n& van Breda 1978; Clayton & Mathis 1988). The existence of these relations, valid over a large\nwavelength interval, suggests that the environmental processes that modify the grains are efficient\nand affect all grains. However, the CCM relation is not a universal law. It does not fit the observed\nextinction in the sightlines observed in the Magellanic Clouds (e.g., Clayton et al. 1996; Gordon &\nClayton 1998; Misselt, Clayton, & Gordon 1999; Gordon et al. 2003). The differences in observed\nextinction properties seen among the Local Group galaxies may be due to various environmental factors including metallicity. The metallicity of the LMC and SMC is lower than the Galaxy.\nTherefore, the nature of the dust in M31 is of great interest because its metallicity is similar to\nthat in the Milky Way.\nThe nature of interstellar dust in M31 is summarized in Lequeux (2000). The UV extinction\ndata for M31, which are based on only a few lightly reddened sightlines, show a CCM-like far-UV\nextinction and a weak 2175 A bump (Bianchi et al. 1996). Several studies have suggested that the\nextinction in M31 in the U-band differs from the Galaxy (Searle 1983; Iye & Richter 1985; Massey\net al. 1995). It has also been suggested that there is a systematic change in the U-band extinction\nwith distance from the center of M31 (Iye & Richter 1985; Freedman & Madore 1990). Various\nextimates of RV ranging from 2.5 to 3.8 have been made using individual stars and clusters in M31\n(Kron & Mayall 1960; Sharov & Lyutyj 1989; Nedialkov & Veltchev 1999). Recently, Barmby et\nal. (2000) find that the U- to K-band extinction curve in M31, derived from a large number of\nglobular clusters, is consistent with CCM with RV =3.1.\nThe interstellar polarization in the LMC and SMC shows a similar wavelength dependence\nto that seen in the Milky Way and can be well fit by the Serkowski relation (Clayton, Martin,\n& Thompson 1983; Clayton et al. 1996; Rodrigues et al. 1997). Some interstellar polarization\nmeasurements in M31 have been made using globular clusters as point sources (Hiltner 1958;\nMartin & Shawl 1979, 1982). However,the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization has\nbeen measured along only one line of sight (Martin & Shawl 1979). This polarization measurement is\nconsistent with the Serkowski relationship and a small value of \u03bbmax . We report further observations\nof the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization in M31.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nOptical spectropolarimetry was obtained using the 6.5 m telescope of the Multiple Mirror\nTelescope (MMT) Observatory located on Mount Hopkins, Arizona. Observations were made of\nfour globular clusters listed in Table 1 on 2003 October 30 UT. All of the observations made use\nof the CCD Spectropolarimeter (Schmidt, Stockman, & Smith 1992), upgraded with a 1200 x 800\npixel, thinned, antireflection-coated, UV-sensitized CCD, and an improved camera lens and half-\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nwave plate. All observations utilized a 600 line mm\u22121 grating for high throughput and wide spectral\ncoverage, 4100-8300 \u00c5. The FWHM resolution with this grating and a slit width of 1\u2032\u2032 is \u223c17 \u00c5\n(3 pixels). A polarimetric measurement sequence involves four separate exposures that sample 16\norientations of the semiachromatic half-wave plate and totalled 480-1440 s of integration for each\nof the four clusters through light cloud cover. Polarization position angles were referenced to the\nequatorial system using interstellar polarization standards (Schmidt, Elston & Lupie 1992). The\nspectral flux distribution is also obtained in the course of the observations and is calibrated relative\nto spectrophotometric standard stars selected from the IRAF database (Massey et al. 1988). The\ndata have been binned and are plotted in Figure 1 along with the spectra of the globular clusters.\nIn addition, spectropolarimetric observations of S78 were obtained with the HPOL spectropolarimeter on the 3.5 m Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-NOAO (WIYN) telescope on Kitt Peak. The spectropolarimeter is a modified Boller & Chivens spectrograph with a rotating superachromatic waveplate after the slit (Nordsieck & Harris 1996; Wolff, Nordsieck, & Nook 1996). Spectra are obtained\nat eight waveplate angles on a Reticon 400 x 1200 CCD. Two gratings are used, producing spectra\nand 3 pixel resolutions of 3200-6200 \u00c5 (9 \u00c5) and 6000-10500 \u00c5 (12 \u00c5), respectively. Two polarized\nstar spectra and two polarized sky spectra are obtained simultaneously. The calibration accuracy\nin polarization is \u00b1p/500 and in position angle is \u00b11\u25e6 . There is an uncertainty of 0.1% in the correction for instrumental polarization. This small uncertainty does not affect the results presented\nhere. The WIYN spectropolarimetric data were obtained in 1996 December and 1998 October. The\nfour nights of data on S78 have been combined and binned to increase the signal-to-noise. They\nare plotted in Figure 1.\nThe polarization measured toward M31 must be corrected for a foreground component. These\nlines of sight pass through the disk and halo of the Galaxy, and then the halo and disk of M31.\nHowever, since M31 lies at a Galactic latitude of -22\u25e6 , the foreground extinction due to dust in\nthe Galaxy is small. Several estimates have been made of the reddening foreground to M31. They\nall indicate that E(B-V) \u223c 0.08-0.11 (Bianchi et al. 1996 and references therein). Using the\nwell-known Galactic relationship between reddening and interstellar polarization, the maximum\nforeground polarization is \u223c 0.9% (Serkowski et al. 1975). Martin & Shawl (1979) estimated the\nactual foreground polarization by measuring a sample of Galactic stars lying in the direction of\nM31 as well as the nucleus of M31 itself. The foreground dust is patchy so there is no way to know\na priori what the foreground component is along any given sightline. So, Martin & Shawl (1982)\nadopted a best-guess value of pmax =0.4%, \u03bbmax = 5500 \u00c5 with a position angle of 90\u25e6 by averaging\nseveral foreground sightlines.\nThe new observations reported here have been corrected for foreground polarization in the\nsame manner as Martin & Shawl (1982). A Galactic Serkowski curve, as described above, was\nassumed and the foreground polarization at each wavelength was calculated and subtracted. The\nforeground-corrected polarizations are plotted in Figure 1. The observed and foreground corrected\nvalues are listed in Tables 2-6. The new data are consistent with the Martin & Shawl (1982) data\nfor S78 in the overlapping wavelength range. Similarly, the three wavelength bins for S150 and one\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nbin for S233, agree with our new data within 2\u03c3. There is only one filterless observation of Baade\n327 having low S/N. The Martin & Shawl filter data are plotted for comparison in Figure 1.\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe interstellar polarization due to dust in M31 was first measured by Hiltner (1958) using\nglobular clusters as point sources. He made unfiltered observations of about 20 clusters finding\nseveral with significant amounts of polarization. Filter polarimetry of a similar number of clusters\nwas obtained by Martin & Shawl (1979,1982). Only one sightline in their sample, toward S78,\nhad enough wavelength coverage for a Serkowski fit to be made. That sightline showed pmax =\n1.98\u00b10.07 %, and \u03bbmax = 3500\u00b1300 \u00c5 using the Wilking et al. (1980) formulation of the Serkowski\nrelation.\nOur new data for S78 and three additional clusters cover approximately the same wavelength\nrange (4100-8300 \u00c5) as Martin & Shawl but with many more data bins and smaller uncertainties.\nWe performed nonlinear least-squares fits to the foreground corrected data for all four clusters\nusing the Serkowski law (Serkowski et al. 1975; Wilking et al. 1980; Wilking, Lebofsky, & Rieke\n1982; Whittet et al. 1992). We found that the K= 1.66\u03bbM ax relationship, that holds for Galactic\ninterstellar polarization, does not produce good fits for the M31 sightlines (Whittet et al. 1992).\nHowever, the Serkowski law with K as a free parameter does produce good fits for all of the\nsightlines. The three fit parameters are listed in Table 1. The relationship between K and \u03bbmax is\nshown in Figure 2. Although, we do not have enough sightlines to define the K-\u03bbmax relationship\nfor M31, Figure 2 shows that the slope may be steeper than in the Galaxy.\nThe K-\u03bbmax relationship for the M31 globulars is very interesting in that it produces distinctly\nnarrower \"Serkowski curves\" than those of the same \u03bbmax in the Galaxy. As has been shown many\ntimes in the past (Wolff et al. 1994; Clayton et al. 1995; Martin et al. 1999), grain models have\ngenerally been able to reproduce observed Galactic interstellar polarization curves by small changes\nto the size distribution of aligned grains, alignment efficiency, upper integration limit, etc. This is\ndefinitely not the case for the M31 curves in that similar changes to a distribution of astronomical\nsilicates failed to produce K values of the observed amplitude. Even more extreme modifications\nto the size distribution of silicate particles (use of \"flat\" distributions, very narrow size ranges,\netc.) tended to produce K values that still remained 30-40% too low, at best. As a result, it would\nappear that there is something intrinsically different (and interesting) about the grains producing\nthe observed polarization in M31 from those in our Galaxy. We intend to investigate this behavior\nin much greater depth after our sample of M31 globulars has been increased.\nPreviously, only S78 had enough wavelength coverage for a Serkowski fit. Our new data, which\nhave better wavelenth coverage and better S/N, show that \u03bbM ax \u223c4775 \u00c5 for S78, very different\nfrom that found by Martin & Shawl (1982). Their value of 3500 \u00c5 is at the extreme low end of\n\u03bbmax values measured in the Galaxy (e.g., Serkowski et al. 1975). The unusual sightline toward\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nHD 210121, which has one of the lowest RV values ever measured, has \u03bbmax \u223c3800 \u00c5 (Larson,\nWhittet, & Hough 1996). None of the \u223c20 sightlines measured in the LMC show \u03bbmax values\nbelow 4900 \u00c5 (Clayton et al. 1983). Only a few sightlines have been observed in the SMC and the\nsignal-to-noise is relatively low but \u03bbmax lies in the normal Galactic range (Rodrigues et al. 1997).\nThe fits for the four sightlines in M31 reveal values of \u03bbmax ranging from 4800 to 5500 \u00c5.\nThese are very average values of \u03bbmax as measured in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. It\nhas been found that RV \u223c 5.5\u03bbmax (Serkowski et al. 1975, Whittet & van Breda 1978; Clayton &\nMathis 1988). The range of \u03bbmax measured in M31 corresponds to RV values of 2.7 to 3.1. The\nrange in RV seen in the Galaxy is 2.5 to 5.5. So, at least for this very small sample, M31 does not\nshow evidence for sightlines with greater than average grain size, if the nature of the grains is the\nsame as for the Galaxy. This result is in contrast to the paucity of small grains inferred from IRAS\ncolors (Xu & Helou 1994).\nThe polarizing efficiency of the M31 dust grains can be estimated using the ratio of peak linear\npolarization to color excess, pmax /E(B-V). While the quantity is often equated with the degree of\ngrain alignment efficiency, it is also a function of the grain's non-spherical nature as well as the\nangle between the alignment axis and the line of sight. However, for brevity, we simply refer to\nthe value as the \"efficiency ratio.\" The maximum value of this ratio found in the Galaxy is 9%\nmag\u22121 (Serkowski et al. 1975; Clayton & Cardelli 1988). We corrected the estimated reddenings\nfor a Galactic foreground of E(B-V)=0.1 mag (Barmby et al. 2000). The values of pmax /E(B-V)\nfor our sample are given in Table 1. They range from 7.1 to 15.3% mag\u22121 . These values generally\nsupport the results of Martin & Shawl (1982) and imply a similar polarization efficiency in M31 and\nthe Galaxy. The values of pmax /E(B-V) for our sample are all near the maximum value but some\nbias is expected since sightlines known to have significant interstellar polarization were selected for\ninclusion in this sample. The polarization efficiency toward S233 seems very high, but the amount\nof reddening is fairly small and the uncertainty is a considerable fraction of the E(B-V) value itself.\nBaade 327 is of interest as it is both the most luminous globular cluster known and also\nthe most reddened globular cluster in M31 (Barmby, Perrett, & Bridges 2002). van den Bergh\n(1968) suggested that it is strange that the brightest globular cluster in M31 would also be the\nmost reddened. This coincidence led to speculation that perhaps the value of RV might be small\nalong this sightline resulting in less total extinction, AV . Our result for Baade 327, \u03bbmax \u223c 5450\n\u00c5 implies that the dust along this sightline has the Galactic average, RV \u223c3.1. Even if RV =\n2.5, as suggested by Kron & Mayall (1960), Baade 327 only drops to the second most luminous\nglobular cluster (Barmby et al. 2002). They also point out that the most reddened globular\nclusters lie close to the center of M31 and those close to the center of M31 seem to be brighter.\nThe polarization efficiency toward Baade 327 is tantalizingly high, particularly given its large color\nexcess and its anticipated favorable viewing geometry (i.e., the angle between alignment and line\nof sight) (Martin & Shawl 1979, 1982). Clearly, additional observations of M31 globular clusters\nwould provide further insight into the dust environment in that galaxy.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nWe thank Pauline Barmby for providing us with reddening estimates for the globular clusters.\nWe also thank Xiaohui Fan and Gary Schmidt for the use of the CCD Spectropolarimeter at the\nMMT during periods when weather conditions were unsuitable for the primary science program.\nThis study has been supported by NASA ATP grant, NAG5-9203.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nREFERENCES\nBarmby, P., Huchra, J.P., Brodie, J.p., Forbes, D.A., Schroder, L.L., & Grillmair, C.J. 2000, AJ,\n119, 727\nBarmby, P., Perrett, K.M., & Bridges, T.J. 2002, MNRAS, 329, 461\nBianchi, L., Clayton, G.C., Hutchings, J.B., Massey, P., & Bohlin, R.C. 1996, ApJ, 471, 203\nCardelli, J.
