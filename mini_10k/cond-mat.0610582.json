Various interesting phenomena have been observed in\nsuch systems, including the superfluid-Mott insulator transition [3, 4], formation of bright\ngap solitons [5], the Josephson effect [6, 7], and breakdown of superfluidity [8, 9, 10, 11,\n12]. In particular, breakdown of superfluidity has attracted much attention. Recently, the\nstability of BECs in an optical lattice moving at constant velocity has been experimentally\ninvestigated and it was demonstrated that the Landau and dynamical instabilities occur\nwhen the velocity of the lattice potential exceeds certain critical values [12].\nSwallow-tail energy loops have been theoretically found in the band structure of BECs\nin a periodic potential [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] and attracted much interests. Mueller pointed\nout that a Bloch state in the upper portion of swallow-tails corresponds to a saddle point in\nthe energy landscape and it is dynamically unstable [16]. In fact, Seaman et al. have shown\nthe instability of a Bloch state in the upper portion of swallow-tails by numerically solving\nthe time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation [17]. However, the stability of swallowtails has not been fully investigated because a detail study of linear stability problem is still\nlacking. One needs to identify the unstable modes of excitations by solving the Bogoliubov\nequations.\nIn this paper, in order to understand the superfluidity of BECs in an optical lattice and\nswallow-tail energy loops, we study BECs in a periodic potential by using the Kronig-Penney\n(KP) model. It is well-known in solid state physics that the KP model is useful for understanding the band structure of electrons [19]. The KP model is also useful for the study of\nBECs in a periodic potential and has remarkable advantages. First, it allows one to calculate the whole band structure of condensate energy and excitation spectrum analytically.\nAnother advantage is that the band structure of excitation spectrum can be calculated from\nthe tunneling problem of Bogoliubov excitations through a single potential barrier. The\ntunneling problem of Bogoliubov excitations has been studied in several papers and it was\nfound that low energy Bogoliubov excitations exhibit anomalous tunneling i.e. a potential\nbarrier is transparent for them [20, 21]. In our previous work, the excitation spectrum of\ncurrent-free condensates has been calculated using the KP model, and it has been shown\nthat the anomalous tunneling is crucial to the phonon spectrum of excitations [22].\n2\n\n\fIn the present paper, we extend the previous work to calculate the excitation spectrum\nof condensates with supercurrents. We solve the Bogoliubov equations using the solution of\nthe tunneling problem of Bogoliubov excitations [23], and discuss the stability of condensates with supercurrents. We will show that the Landau and dynamical instabilities occur\nwhen the quasimomentum of the condensate exceeds certain critical values. We identify the\nunstable modes causing the Landau and dynamical instabilities. We will also show that the\nBloch state of the upper portion of swallow-tail is dynamically unstable, but the excitation\nspectrum has a phonon branch due to the positive effective mass.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce our model and formulation\nbased on the Gross-Pitaevskii mean-field theory. In Sec. III, we solve the time-independent\nGP equation and calculate the first condensate band, group velocity and effective mass.\nThe condition for the presence of swallow-tails are discussed. In Sec. IV, we solve the\nBogoliubov equations and calculate the band structure of the excitation spectrum. In Sec.\nV, we discuss the stability of BECs with superfluid currents in a periodic potential. In Sec.\nVI, we summarize our results. Some details of our calculation in Sec. III and IV are given\nin Appendix.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL AND FORMULATION\n\nWe consider a BEC at the absolute zero of temperature confined in a combined potential of\na box-shaped trap and a one-dimensional periodic potential. A box-shaped trap was realized\nin a recent experiment with a radial harmonic confinement and end caps [26]. The frequency\nof the radial harmonic potential is assumed to be much larger than the excitation energy\nin the axial direction so that the one-dimensional treatment of the problem is justified [22].\nIt is also assumed that the axial size of the system is so large that the effect of the edge of\nthe system can be neglected. We consider condensates with supercurrents flowing through\nthe periodic potential. This situation can be realized by an optical lattice consisting of\ntwo counter-propagating laser beams with a frequency difference and moving in a constant\nvelocity [11, 12].\nThe periodic potential is assumed to be an array of \u03b4-function potential barriers,\nV (x) = V0\n\nX\nj\n\n3\n\n\u03b4(x \u2212 ja),\n\n(1)\n\n\fFIG. 1: Schematic picture of a current-carrying condensate in a KP potential. The solid lines, gray\nbars and dashed arrow express the condensate density |\u03a80 (x)|2 , potential barriers and supercurrent,\nrespectively.\n\nwhere a is the lattice constant, and V0 is the potential strength. Note that V0 and a are\nindependent parameters. Equation (1) is a special type of the KP potential. A schematic\npicture of the system is shown in Fig. 1. Although the periodic potential of optical lattices\nin experiments is sinusoidal, the KP model provides us with valuable insights. BECs in a\nKP potential have the same properties as those in a sinusoidal potential, such as the band\nstructure [17, 18] and the excitation spectrum of a current-free condensate [22]. As we\ndiscuss later, the Landau and dynamical instabilities of BECs occur in a KP potential as in\na sinusoidal potential.\nOur formulation of the problem is based on the Gross-Pitaevskii mean-field theory [27, 28].\nThe condensate wave function \u03a8(x, t) obeys the time-dependent GP equation,\n\u0015\n\u0014\n~2 d 2\n\u2202\u03a8\n2\n= \u2212\n+ V (x) + g|\u03a8| \u03a8,\ni~\n\u2202t\n2m dx2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the atoms and g is the mean-field coupling constant. The coupling\nconstant in 1D is given by g =\n\n2~2 a0\nma2\u22a5\n\n[29], where a0 is the s-wave scattering length and a\u22a5\n\nis the harmonic oscillator length of the radial confinement. The static solution \u03a80 (x) of Eq.\n(2) satisfies the time-independent GP equation\n\u0015\n\u0014\n~2 d 2\n2\n\u2212 \u03bc + V (x) + g|\u03a80(x)| \u03a80 (x) = 0,\n\u2212\n2m dx2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the chemical potential. The normalization condition is given by\nZ\n\n(j+1)a\n\nja\n\n|\u03a80 (x)|2 dx = NC .\n\n(4)\n\nNC is the number of condensate atoms per site. The energy of the condensate per site is\n4\n\n\fgiven by\nE=\n\nZ\n\n(j+1)a\n\nja\n\ndx\u03a8\u22170\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n~2 d 2\ng\n2\n\u2212\n+ V (x) + |\u03a80 | \u03a80 .\n2m dx2\n2\n\n(5)\n\nConsidering small fluctuations from \u03a80 (x), the condensate wave function can be written as\n\u03a8(x, t) = e\u2212\n\ni\u03bct\n~\n\nh\ni\ni\u03b5t\ni\u03b5t\n\u03a80 (x) + u(x)e\u2212 ~ \u2212 v(x)\u2217 e ~ .\n\n(6)\n\nSubstituting Eq. (6) into Eq. (2) and keeping only linear terms of the fluctuation, (u(x), v(x))\nobeys the Bogoliubov equations.\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nH0\n\u2212g\u03a80 (x)2\nu(x)\nu(x)\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\uf8ed\n\uf8f8 = \u03b5\uf8ed\n\uf8f8,\n\u22172\ng\u03a80 (x)\n\u2212H0\nv(x)\nv(x)\nH0 \u2261 \u2212\n\n~2 d 2\n\u2212 \u03bc + V (x) + 2g|\u03a80|2 ,\n2m dx2\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\n\u03b5/~ and (u(x), v(x)) describe the frequency and amplitude of the collective mode of the\ncondensate.\nAsserting the normalization condition\nZ\n\u0001\ndx |u(x)|2 \u2212 |v(x)|2 = 1,\n\n(9)\n\none can quantize the collective modes and regard them as elementary excitations [27, 28].\nWe hereafter call \u03b5 and (u(x), v(x)) as the energy and the wave function of the elementary\nexcitation. Strictly speaking, elementary excitations with complex energies do not exist,\nbecause the normalization condition Eq. (9) is not satisfied if \u03b5 is not real [25, 27, 30].\nHowever, we use this term by implicitly meaning collective modes with complex frequencies.\nThe stability of BECs can be studied by calculating the excitation energy. The appearance\nof excitations with negative energies signals the Landau instability. It reveals that the\nsolution \u03a80 of the time-independent GP equation does not correspond to a local minimum\nin the energy landscape [24, 25, 27]. This means that the process of spontaneous creation\nof excitations can take place and the system becomes unstable [31]. On the other hand,\nthe appearance of excitations with complex energies signals the dynamical instability which\nmeans exponential growth of the fluctuation in time. The detail of the difference between\nthe Landau and dynamical instabilities has been discussed in Refs. [30, 32].\n\n5\n\n\fIII.\n\nCONDENSATE BAND AND SWALLOW-TAIL\n\nIn this section, we shall obtain the Bloch state solution of Eq. (3) and calculate the\nenergy of the condensate E, group velocity vg and effective mass m\u2217 as functions of the\ncondensate quasimomentum K. Assuming that the lattice constant is much larger than the\nhealing length, analytic expressions of these quantities are obtained.

The higher order terms of the expansion are shown in Appendix, because\nthey are necessary for the calculations in the following sections.\nIn Fig. 4, Q is shown as a function of \u03c6. In Eq.

A loop structure of \u03bc(K) and a swallow-tail of E(K) are present at the edge\nof the first Brillouin zone for relatively small V0 (thick black lines). The loop structure and\nswallow-tail become smaller as V0 increases and they disappear for a certain critical value of\nV0 (gray lines). The condition for the presence of swallow-tail (loop structure) is obtained\nfrom Eq. (36) as follows. A swallow-tail is present if there are two values of \u03c6 which satisfy\nEq. (36) with Ka = \u03c0, while a swallow-tail is not present if there is only one value of \u03c6\nwhich satisfies Eq. (36) with Ka = \u03c0. This condition yields the threshold\nV0 =\n\ngnav a\n,\n2\n\n(37)\n\nwhich agrees with the result obtained by the numerical calculations in Ref.

When the potential\nstrength is larger than the critical value of Eq. (37), the reentrant structure is absent.\nIn the limit of V0 \u226b gnav a, the first condensate band and group velocity take the form\nof the tight-binding approximation [25, 39, 40],\n2\nE|\u03c6=0\ngnav \u03beav\nE\n\u2243\n+\n(1 \u2212 cosKa),\nNC gnav\nNC gnav\n2aV0\nvg\ngnav \u03beav\n\u2243\nsin Ka.\ncs\n2V0\n\n12\n\n(40)\n(41)\n\n\fFIG. 7:\n\nGroup velocity vg as a function of the quasimomentum K.

We will discuss the detail of this issue in Sec.

The sign of the\neffective mass changes when the group velocity takes its extremum. m\u2217 (K) also changes its\nsign at the edge of the swallow-tail, because\n\n\u2202vg\n\u2202K\n\ndiverges there. m\u2217 (K) is always positive in\n\nthe upper portion of the swallow-tail and negative near the edge of the swallow-tail in the\nlower portion. This is consistent with the result of the exact solution Eqs.

Condensates are expected to be stable for the long-wavelength\nperturbation in the upper portion of a swallow-tail, because of the positive effective mass.\nHowever, the upper portion of a swallow-tail corresponds to energy saddle points in the twostate approximation and is predicted to be unstable [16]. The dynamical instability of the\nupper portion of a swallow-tail has been shown by numerically solving the time-dependent\nGP equation [17]. We will calculate the excitation spectrum in the following sections and\nshow that the spectrum has a phonon branch but also has a different branch causing the\ndynamical instability.\nFrom Fig. 9, it can be seen that the effective mass changes its sign twice for positive\nK. Since the sign of the effective mass is closely related to the stability of condensates, it\n15\n\n\fis important to calculate the quasimomentum at which the effective mass changes its sign.\nKM is determined by the condition of maximum group velocity as\n\u2202vg\n= 0.\n\u2202K\n\n(48)\n\nAssuming V0 \u226b gnav \u03beav , the phase difference \u03c6M when K = KM can be calculated from Eqs.\n(48) and (A12) in Appendix as\ncos\u03c6M =\n\n2\ngnav \u03beav gnav \u03beav\n(gnav \u03beav )2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n.\nV0\naV0\n2V02\n\n(49)\n\nSubstituting Eq.

We hereafter call the band\nstructure of excitation spectrum as the Bogoliubov band. As is well known, the band structure\nof a single particle in a periodic potential can be calculated from a single barrier problem [46].\nIn our previous work, the Bogoliubov band of a current-free condensate in a KP potential\nhas been calculated from a single-barrier problem for Bogoliubov excitations [22]. We shall\nextend this work to the case of current-carrying condensates.\n16\n\n\fA.\n\nSingle-barrier problem\n\nIn a recent work, the scattering problem of Bogoliubov excitations of a current-carrying\ncondensate has been studied, and it has been found that the tunneling properties, such\nas transmission coefficient and phase shift, strongly depend on the presence of a supercurrent [23]. Here, we briefly review the calculation in Ref. [23], since it is necessary for the\ncalculation of the Bogoliubov band.\nWe assume a single potential barrier V (x) = V0 \u03b4(x). The solution of the time-independent\nGP equation is given by Eq. (23). The solution of the Bogoliubov equations with Eq. (23)\ncan be calculated from the solution for a gray soliton obtained in Ref.

T l s with \u03c6 = 0, \u03c6 = \u03c0/3,\n\u03c6 = \u03c6A \u2243 \u03c0/2, \u03c6 = 2\u03c0/3 and \u03c6 = \u03c0 are shown.\n\nIn Figs. 13 and 14, the transmission coefficient T l \u2261 |tl |2 and the phase shift \u03b4 l \u2261 arg(tl )\nare shown as functions of the excitation energy \u03b5 and the phase difference \u03c6. As shown in\nRef. [23], the transmission coefficient strongly depends on the phase difference as follows.\nWhen \u03c6 = 0, T l approaches unity and \u03b4 l approaches zero as \u03b5 approaches zero. This means\nthat the potential barrier is transparent for the low-energy excitations. This behavior is\ncalled as anomalous tunneling [20, 21]. As \u03c6 increases, the peak width of T l decreases. The\npeak width becomes zero and the sign of \u03b4 l changes when \u03c6 = \u03c6A \u2243\n\n\u03c0\n.\n2\n\nThe anomalous\n\ntunneling is absent when \u03c6 = \u03c6A . As \u03c6 increases further from \u03c6A , the peak width increases\nand the anomalous tunneling appears again in the region \u03c6A < \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c0.\nThe superfluid momentum Q takes its maximum value when \u03c6 = \u03c6A [23]. Accordingly,\n\u03c6A is determined by the condition\n\u2202Q\n= 0.\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(63)\n\nWhen V0 \u226b gn0 \u03be0 , \u03c6A can be calculated from Eqs.

(36), KA corresponding \u03c6A can be calculated. Comparing\nEqs. (64) and (49), one can see that |KA |, at which the anomalous tunneling is absent, is\nalways smaller than |KM |, which gives the maximum supercurrent [47]. As we will discuss\nin Sec. V, K = KA is the onset of the Landau instability in a KP potential.\n\n20\n\n\fB.\n\nBogoliubov band\n\nSince the Bogoliubov equations are linear differential equations, a general solution of the\nequations can be described as a linear combination of independent solutions with the same\nenergy. A general solution of the Bogoliubov equations with a single potential barrier can\nbe written as a linear combination of \u03c8 l (x) and \u03c8 r (x)\n\u03c8(x) = \u03b1\u03c8 l (x) + \u03b2\u03c8 r (x),\n\n(65)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are arbitrary constants.\nThe solution of the Bogoliubov equations with the periodic potential Eq. (1) can be\ncalculated by imposing the Bloch theorem to Eq. (65) as the current-free case in Ref. [22].\nHowever, the non-diagonal element of Eq. (7) does not have the periodicity of a when\nthe condensate has a supercurrent, because \u03a80 (x) satisfies the Bloch theorem Eq.

(72).\n\nIf \u03b5 is real, one can prove from the Bogoliubov equations that the Wronskian defined by\nW(\u03c8 j\u2217,\u03c8 i ) = uj\u2217\n\nd i i d j\u2217 j\u2217 d i i d j\u2217\nu \u2212u\nu +v\nv \u2212v\nv\ndx\ndx\ndx\ndx\n\n(73)\n\nis independent of x, where \u03c8 j and \u03c8 i are the solutions with the same energy.

(72) and (77) are valid only when a \u226b \u03beav . Equation (77) is\nnot valid when \u03b5 is complex, because \u03b5 is assumed to be real in the derivation. We have to\nsolve Eq. (72) when complex \u03b5(q) exists.\nSolving Eq. (77), the Bogoliubov band \u03b5(q) can be calculated. The Bogoliubov band\nfor a = 15 \u03beav , V0 = 5 gnav \u03beav and K =\n\nKA\n2\n\nis shown in Fig. 15(a). Since \u03b5(q) is real and\n\npositive, the condensate with superfluid flow is stable when K =\n\nKA\n.\n2\n\nIn contrast to the case\n\nof a current-free condensate in Ref. [22], \u03b5(q) is asymmetric with respect to q = 0. This is\nbecause the existence of the supercurrent breaks the left-right symmetry of the system.\n22\n\n\fFIG. 15:\n\nBogoliubov band of a current-carrying condensate in a KP potential for a = 15\u03beav ,\n\nV0 = 5gnav \u03beav and K =\n\nKA\n2 .\n\nThe band structure is shown in (a) and the left-hand side of Eq.

(77) as a function of \u03b5 is shown. There exists no\nsolution of Eq. (77) when the absolute value of the left-hand side exceeds unity, because the\nabsolute value of the right-hand side is always less than unity. The energy regions for no\nsolutions correspond to the band gaps. They are expressed as the shaded regions in Fig. 15.\n\nV.\n\nSTABILITY OF SUPERFLUID FLOW\n\nSince the phonons around q = 0 are expected to be closely related to the stability, we\nshall calculate the excitation spectrum in the limit q \u2192 0. If one expands Eq. (72) assuming\n\n23\n\n\fq \u226a \u03c0a , the linear dispersion of the excitation spectrum is obtained as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (c + v )|q|, q > 0,\nb\n\u03bc\n\u03b5=\n\uf8f3 (cb \u2212 v\u03bc )|q|, q < 0,\n\n(79)\n\nwhere cb and v\u03bc are given by Eqs. (47) and (42), respectively. Equation (79) has been\nderived previously by using the hydrodynamic analysis [15], the systematic q-expansion of\nthe Bogoliubov equations [41] and the tight-binding model [40, 42]. The change in the\nslope of the linear dispersion by v\u03bc is analogous to the change of the phonon dispersion in\na uniform system due to the Galilean transformation.\nIn Fig. 16, a magnification of a swallow-tail energy loop in the first condensate band is\nshown, and KA , KM and KE are indicated by allows. We first consider a condensate with\na positive group velocity vg in the lower portion of the swallow-tail (the region shown by\nthe black solid line in Fig. 16). The Landau (energetical) instability occurs if there exists\nany excitation with negative energy. One can clearly see from Eq. (79) that the Landau\ninstability occurs if v\u03bc > cs . We confirmed the fact that the onset of the Landau instability\nis due to excitations with small q by numerically solving Eq. (72). Therefore, the onset of\nthe Landau instability is given by the condition\nv\u03bc = cs .\n\n(80)\n\nAssuming V0 \u226b gnav \u03beav and solving Eq. (80), one obtains\ncos\u03c6Lan \u2243\n\n2\n(gnav \u03beav )2\ngnav \u03beav gnav \u03beav\n+\n\u2212\n,\nV0\naV0\n2V02\n\n(81)\n\nwhere \u03c6Lan is the phase difference corresponding to the critical quasimomentum for the\nLandau instability KLan . From Eqs. (64) and (81), one sees that KLan = KA , namely the\nonset of the Landau instability coincides with the point at which the anomalous tunneling\nis absent.\nDynamical instability occurs if there exists any excitation with complex energy. From Eqs.\n(47) and (79), one can see that excitations around q = 0 cause the dynamical instability if the\neffective mass is negative, namely K > KM . On the other hand, it can be expected that the\ndynamical instability sets in at K < KM due to excitations around q = \u03c0a , because crossing\nof phonon and anti-phonon branches, which is crucial to the appearance of excitations with\ncomplex energies, occurs initially at q =\n\n\u03c0\na\n\n[24, 25, 41]. We calculate the critical value of K\n24\n\n\fFIG. 17: First Bogoliubov band with K \u2264 KA for (a, V0 ) = (15 \u03beav , 5 gnav \u03beav ).\n\nfor the dynamical instability caused by excitations around q = \u03c0a . The first Bogoliubov band\nis analytically expressed by assuming K \u223c KA . For avoiding the complication of equations,\nwe introduce a variable b defined as\nb=\n\naV0\n(cos\u03c6A \u2212 cos\u03c6) ,\ngnav \u03beav\n\n(82)\n\nwhere \u22122 \u2264 b \u2264 2. b is a function of K, for example, b(KA ) = 0 and b(KM ) = 2. Assuming\nV0 \u226b gnav \u03beav and substituting Eq. (82) into Eq. (72), one obtains\nr\n\u0012\n\u0010 \u0011\u0013\n2\n\u03b5\ngnav \u03beav\n2\n2 qa\nsin(qa) \u00b1 sin (qa) \u2212 2b sin\n.\n\u2243\ngnav\naV0\n2\n\n(83)\n\nExpanding Eq. (83) around q = \u03c0a , it reduces to\n\n\u0011\n2 \u0010\n\u221a\ngnav \u03beav\n\u03b5\n\u2243\n\u03c0 \u2212 qa + \u22122b .\ngnav\naV0\n\n(84)\n\nOne can see from Eq. (84) that the dynamical instability due to excitations with q =\n\n\u03c0\na\n\nstarts at K = KA . Therefore, both the Landau and dynamical instabilities start to occur\nat K = KA . In the case of condensates in a sinusoidal potential, the onset of the Landau\ninstability asymptotically approaches that of the dynamical instability in the limit of gnav \u226b\nER , where ER =\n\n\u03c02\n2ma2\n\nis the recoil energy [15]. Since our assumption of sufficiently large\n\nlattice constant compared to the healing length corresponds to the condition gnav \u226b ER ,\nour result is consistent with that of condensates in a sinusoidal potential.\nIn Figs. 17 and 18, the first Bogoliubov bands in the regions K \u2264 KA and KA \u2264 K \u2264 KM\nare shown, respectively. In these figures, one can clearly see that the Landau and dynamical\ninstabilities start simultaneously at K = KA . It is also clear that condensates in the region\nof KA < K < KM are always unstable due to both Landau and dynamical instabilities.\n25\n\n\fFIG. 18: First Bogoliubov band with KA \u2264 K \u2264 KM for (a, V0 ) = (15 \u03beav , 5gnav \u03beav ).

The slope\nbecomes zero at K = KA (Fig. 17). When K exceeds KA , excitations with negative energies\nappear (Fig. 18(a)). At the same time, the imaginary part of the excitation energy grows\naround q =\n\n\u03c0\na\n\n(Fig. 18(b)). For K > KM , all the excitations in the first Bogoliubov band\n\nhave complex energies.\nWe consider a condensate with a positive group velocity vg around the edge of the swallowtail K = KE , including the upper portion of it. In Figs. 19 and 20, the first and second\nBogoliubov bands around K = KE are shown, respectively. Since there always exist excitations with complex energies in the first Bogoliubov band (Fig. 19), the upper portion\nof the swallow-tail is dynamically unstable. This result agrees with that of the numerical\nsimulation by the time-dependent GP equation in Ref. [17]. On the other hand, we find in\nFig. 20 that there also exists a phonon spectrum in the upper portion, reflecting the positive\neffective mass. As K in the lower portion of the swallow-tail approaches KE , the bottom\nof the second Bogoliubov band approaches the origin. The second Bogoliubov band turns\ninto a gapless dispersion when K reaches KE , and it has a phonon spectrum in the upper\nportion.\n26\n\n\fFIG. 19: First Bogoliubov band around the edge of the swallow-tail for (a, V0 ) = (15, 5).

To conclude this section, we show the stability phase diagram\nin Fig. 21.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn summary, we have studied the stability and excitations of Bose-Einstein condensates\nwith superfluid current in a Kronig-Penney potential based on the Gross-Pitaevskii mean27\n\n\fFIG. 21:\n\nStability phase diagram of the condensate in a KP potential when (a, V0 ) =\n\n(15 \u03beav , 5 gnav \u03beav ). The light shaded area and the dark shaded area correspond to the regions\nof the Landau instability and the dynamical instability, respectively. This figure is focused to the\nswallow-tail energy loop.\n\nfield theory. Solving the time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii equation, analytic form of the\ncondensate wave function in the first condensate band has been obtained. Using this solution,\nthe condensate band structure, group velocity and the effective mass have been calculated. It\nhas been found that the first condensate band has a swallow-tail energy loop if 2V0 < gnav a.\nThis condition agrees with the result obtained by numerical calculations in Ref. [17].\nImposing the Bloch theorem on the solution of the Bogoliubov equations in the singlebarrier problem, we have calculated the Bogoliubov band and investigated the stability of the\ncondensate. We have found that the onsets of the Landau instability caused by excitations\naround q = 0 and the dynamical instability caused by excitations around q =\n\n\u03c0\na\n\ncoincide,\n\nand anomalous tunneling of low-energy phonons for each potential barrier is absent at this\npoint. When the effective mass is negative, condensates are dynamically unstable due to\nthe excitations in the first Bogoliubov band. It has been found that the second Bogoliubov\nband has a phonon spectrum in the upper portion of a swallow-tail, while the upper portion\nis always dynamically unstable due to the excitations in the first Bogoliubov band.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank S.
