The question of the degree of order in the magnetic fields of relativistic jets is important to any understanding\nof their production. Both vector-ordered (e.g. helical) and disordered, but anisotropic fields can produce the high observed\ndegrees of polarization. We outline our models of jets in FR I radio galaxies as decelerating relativistic flows. We then present\ntheoretical calculations of the synchrotron emission from different field configurations and compare them with observed\nemission from FR I jets. We show that large-scale helical fields (with significant poloidal and toroidal components) are\ninconsistent with observations. The combination of an ordered toroidal and disordered poloidal component is consistent with\nour data, as is an entirely disordered field. Jets must also contain small, but significant amounts of radial field.\nKey words: galaxies: jets \u2013 radio continuum: galaxies \u2013 magnetic fields \u2013 polarization \u2013 MHD\nc 0000 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n\n1. Introduction\nThis paper addresses two questions:\n1. Is the magnetic field in extragalactic radio jets vectorordered or does it have many reversals?\n2. What is its three-dimensional structure?\nObservations of polarized synchrotron emission at frequencies where Faraday rotation is negligible can be used to infer a two-dimensional projection of the field structure on the\nplane of the sky (we refer to the apparent magnetic field direction, which is the perpendicular to the observed E-vector\nposition angle). This emission is an emissivity-weighted integral through the jet, affected by relativistic aberration if the\nflow speed is comparable with c but independent of reversals\nin the field. Measurement of Faraday rotation can potentially\nbe used to determine the vector field component along the\nline of sight within a jet, but the thermal plasma responsible\nmust be within the jet volume, rather than in front of it, as\nusually appears to be the case (e.g. Laing et al. 2006).\nWe have developed models of jets in low-power FR I (Fanaroff & Riley 1974) radio sources as decelerating relativistic flows. By fitting to deep radio images, we can determine\nthe geometry and the distributions of velocity and emissivity.\nOur technique also constrains the three-dimensional strucCorrespondence to: rlaing@eso.org\n\nture of the magnetic field. We cannot determine this structure uniquely, but we can estimate the ratios of the longitudinal, toroidal and radial components and eliminate some of\nthe simpler proposed field geometries.\nOur fundamental assumption is that jets are intrinsically\nsymmetrical and relativistic. Aberration then acts differently\non radiation from the approaching and receding jets, so their\nobserved synchrotron images are two-dimensional projections of the field structure viewed from different directions.\nFrom these, subject to some additional assumptions, we can\ninfer the three-dimensional structure of the field. One key assumption is axisymmetry: if this holds, we can also use the\nsymmetry of the transverse brightness and polarization profiles to distinguish (at least in some cases) between vectorordered and disordered fields.\n\n2. Jet models\nWe model FR I jets as intrinsically symmetrical, axisymmetric, relativistic, stationary flows, in which the magnetic fields\nare assumed to be disordered, but anisotropic (see Section 3\nfor a detailed discussion of this assumption). We adopt simple, parameterized functional forms for the geometry and the\nspatial variations of velocity (allowing both deceleration and\ntransverse gradients), emissivity and field-component ratios.\nWe then optimize the model parameters by fitting to deep\n\n\f3 FIELD CONFIGURATIONS\n\n(a) Polarization vectors: model\n\n(b) Polarization vectors: data\n\nFig. 2.

The resolution is 2.35 arcsec. The polarization and\nangular scales are indicated by the labelled bars in the lower\npanel. (a) model; (b) data.\nVLA images in I, Q and U . The model brightness distributions are derived by integration along the line of sight, including the effects of anisotropy in the rest-frame emission,\naberration and beaming. Note that modelling of the linear polarization is essential to break the degeneracy between angle\nto the line of sight and velocity. Details of the models are\ngiven by Laing & Bridle (2002), Canvin & Laing (2004) and\nCanvin et al. (2005). A comparison between our best-fitting\nmodel and VLA data for the first arcminute of the jets in\nNGC 315 is shown in Fig. 1 (Canvin et al. 2005).\n\n3. Field configurations\nThe models we have discussed so far fit the observations very\nwell, but make a specific assumption about the structure of\nthe field: namely that it is disordered on small scales, but\nanisotropic. An alternative class of field structures, proposed\non theoretical grounds, has a vector-ordered, quasi-helical\n\nstructure. In this section, we consider how to differentiate observationally between these structures.\nThe generic polarization structure which we seek to\nmodel has an apparent magnetic field which is transverse on\nthe axis of the jet but longitudinal at its edges (Fig. 1). Three\nfield structures which can all produce this effect are sketched\nin Fig. 2. The first is an ordered, helical field. For simplicity, we take this to have a constant pitch angle, but qualitatively similar results are obtained from generically similar,\nbut more complex configurations. The second has a spine of\ntwo-dimensional field sheets with equal components in directions orthogonal to the jet axis but no longitudinal component\nsurrounded by a longitudinal-field shear layer (Laing 1980,\n1993). The third has two-dimensional field sheets wrapped\naround the axis, giving equal toroidal and longitudinal, but\nno radial component (model B of Laing 1980).\nFig. 3 illustrates the brightness and polarization structure\nproduced by a helical field in a jet. In general, helical fields\nproduce asymmetric transverse brightness and polarization\nprofiles (Laing 1981). The profiles are symmetrical only if\nthe field is purely toroidal or the jet is at 90\u25e6 to the line of\nsight in the rest frame of the emitting material. The condition\nfor the approaching jet to appear side-on in the rest frame is\n\u03b2 = cos \u03b81 . The counter-jet can never appear edge-on in its\nrest frame unless \u03b2 = 0 and \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 . Fig 4 shows average\ntransverse profiles of total intensity and degree of polarization\nfor the jets in NGC 315 (Canvin et al. 2005). Our modelling\n1\n\n\u03b2 = cos \u03b8 is also the condition for maximum Doppler boost, so\nthere is a selection effect in favour of observing symmetrical transverse profiles in blazar jets, even if their fields are helical.\n\n\f3 FIELD CONFIGURATIONS\n\nFig. 3. Total intensity and linear polarization from a (nonrelativistic) jet containing a helical magnetic field of pitch\nangle 45\u25e6 at angles to the line of sight of \u03b8 = 45\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 .\nLeft: sketch showing the projection of field lines on the plane\nof the sky. Full line, \u03b8 = 45\u25e6 ; dotted line, \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 . Middle and right: grey-scales of total intensity with superposed\nvectors whose lengths are proportional to the degree of polarization and directions along the apparent magnetic field.\nMiddle: \u03b8 = 45\u25e6 ; right: \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 .\nshows that the angle to the line of sight is \u2248 38\u25e6 and that the\nfield must have a a mixture of longitudinal and toroidal components. The profiles are extremely symmetrical, especially\nin the counter-jet, so we can rule out an ordered helical field\nat least in this source. The toroidal field component could be\nordered, for example if the longitudinal component has many\nreversals. More generally, a symmetrical transverse profile requires a symmetrical distribution of field directions in the rest\nframe of the jet flow.\nThe other two field geometries sketched in Fig. 2 can be\ndistinguished by the relative positions of the transition between longitudinal and transverse apparent field on the jet\naxis in the main and counter-jets, provided that the flow is\nrelativistic and decelerating. In the case of a perpendicularfield spine surrounded by a longitudinal-field shear layer, the\napparent field transition always occurs further from the nucleus in the counter-jet and may not be seen in the main jet.\nFor field sheets wrapped around the jet axis, giving longitudinal and toroidal components only, the converse is true. This is\nillustrated in Fig. 5. It has been known for some time that the\nbrighter jet in an FR I source tends to show a transition from\nlongitudinal apparent field close to the nucleus to transverse\napparent field further out (Bridle 1984). Our deeper observations indicate that the counter-jets either show transverse\napparent fields on-axis over their entire lengths, or have a\ntransition much closer to the nucleus (Laing & Bridle 2002;\nCanvin & Laing 2004; Canvin et al. 2005; see also Hardcastle et al. 1997). We conclude that a first approximation to the\nfield configuration in FR I jets is a mixture of toroidal and\nlongitudinal components.\nDetailed modelling (in which the ratios between the field\ncomponents are allowed to vary as functions of position) confirms this general conclusion, but adds detail.

Nor should they be: for a conical jet\nwith velocity \u03b2c and bulk Lorentz factor \u0393, the fluxes\nfor the longitudinal and transverse field components are\n\u221d r\u22122 and \u221d (\u0393\u03b2r)\u22121 , respectively, where r is the distance from the nucleus. The longitudinal flux must be\nvery small at large distances from the nucleus, otherwise\nthe energy density in the magnetic field close to the accretion disk or black hole would be too high (Begelman,\nBlandford & Rees 1984).\n\u2013 The field is primarily toroidal and longitudinal, with a\nsmaller radial component in some objects.\n\u2013 The toroidal component could be ordered, provided that\nthe longitudinal component has many reversals.\n\n\fReferences\n\nReferences\n0.0\n\n(a) Perpendicular-field spine +\nlongitudinal-field shear layer\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n(a) Radial\n\n(c) Longitudinal\n\n(b) Toroidal\n\n(d) Dominant field components\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nField transition\n(b) Toroidal + longitudinal field\n\nFig. 6.

Further work\nIn principle, our modelling technique should work for jets in\npowerful (FR II) sources on kpc scales and for pc-scale jets.\nThere are three main reasons why this is difficult:\n\u2013 counter-jets are faint and in some cases the jet/counter-jet\nratios are very large (presumably the flow is faster);\n\u2013 the jets are narrow and\n\u2013 more powerful jets show significant sub-structure, over\nwhich we need to average in order to make a robust comparison of the main and counter-jets.\nThe only FR II jets which have been well enough resolved to\ngive any idea of their 3D field structures are those in 3C 353\n\n(Swain, Bridle & Baum 1998). There, a roughly equal mix\nof longitudinal and toroidal field also gives the best fit to the\npolarization data, although the jet velocity is not well constrained. A slightly different approach is feasible in microquasars, where components from a single ejection event can\noften be identified on both sides of the nucleus. Our technique\ncould then be used to compare the brightness and polarization\nof the jet and counter-jet components directly, with the added\nadvantage of known proper motions.\nFor these new applications, we will need sensitivities of\n0.1 \u2013 1 \u03bcJy rms and > 105 :1 dynamic range at frequencies\nchosen to be able to resolve and remove Faraday rotation.\nThe resolutions required range from 0.1 arcsec for the nearest\nFR II sources to < 0.1 milliarcsec for parsec-scale jets. We\nlook forward to EVLA, eMERLIN and broad-band VLBI.\nAcknowledgements.
