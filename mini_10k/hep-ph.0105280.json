However as a quantum\nfield theory in its usual formalism, this idea suffers the problem of dimensional\ncouplings; namely, the perturbative series is out of control once the energy\nscale approaches upwards the cutoff. One outlet, being reasonable from both\ntechnical and physical senses, is to complete the higher-dimensional theory with\na more fundamental theory at its ultraviolet end, with or without gravity being\nincluded. To be another candidate of these UV-completions, ACG-model 2 is\ncharacterized as being fully under control; in out understanding, this feature\nis the initial, if not unique, motivation of this speculation from ACG.\n1.2\n\nPictures\n\nSuppose that the Platonic physics without including gravity is a four-dimensional\n\u22121 i\nquantum gauge theory. The gauge group is of a direct product form (\u03a0N\ni=0 G )\u2297\nN \u22121 i\n(\u03a0i=0 Gs ) where N is a generic (large) integer. A collection of Weyl fermions\n1\n\n\ftransform according to \u03c7i \u223c Rdef (Gi )\u2297Rdef (Gis ), \u03be i \u223c Rdef (Gis )\u2297Rdef (Gi+1 ),\ni = 0, 1, 2, ..., N \u2212 1 in which Rdef (G) is the definition representation of G and\nR is the complex conjugate representation of a representation R. Note that\ni + 1 is computed modulo N , which is taken to be a convention henceforth in\ncorresponding context. Let Gi = U (m), Gis = SU (n) for all i = 0, 1, 2, ..., N \u22121\nwith generic m, n, where the choice of Gi here is enlarged compared with the\noriginal ACG's consideration. A cyclic symmetry is assumed to set gauge couplings of Gis to be gs and those of Gi to be gd and g for the center subgroups\nand the quotients respectively. gd is supposed to be weak for all energy scales\nthat we are interested. By the mechanism of dimensional transmutation, the\ngauge couplings g, gs can be described as well by two energy scales \u039b, \u039bs\nrespectively; here it is required that \u039bs \u226b \u039b.\nWhen energy scale is lower downwards \u039bs , gauge interactions of Gis become\nstrong and fermion condensates happen in a way that h\u03c7i \u03be i i \u223c 4\u03c0fs3 Ui,i+1\nwhere fs is a decay constant of mass dimension and Ui,i+1 is \u03c3-model scalar\ntransformed as Ui,i+1 \u223c Rdef (Gi )\u2297Rdef (Gi+1 ). Below, let m = 1 for simplicity\nhence the subscripts \"d\" are omitted. The low energy effective theory is read\nas\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n1 i\nF * F i + fs2 (D\u03bc Ui,i+1 )\u2020 D\u03bc Ui,i+1 ) + (irrelevant terms)\n2\n4g\ni=0\n(1)\nwhere the covariant derivative is defined to be D\u03bc Ui,i+1 = \u2202\u03bc Ui,i+1 \u2212iAi\u03bc Ui,i+1 +\niUi,i+1 Ai+1\n\u03bc . The center observation of ACG is that action Eq.(1) is\non the other hand a five-dimensional gauge theory where the fifth\ndirection is a periodic lattice with N sites. The following geometric and\nphysical quantities can be computed, as low\n\u221a energy phenomenology provided\nby ACG-model. Lattice spacing a = 1/( 2gfs ), circumference R = N a and\nfive dimensional gauge coupling g5 = ag 2 . The fluctuations Ui,i+1 higgs gauge\nsymmetry down to a diagonal subgroup and mass square spectral of gauge\nbosons are\nMk = 8g 2 fs2 sin2 (\u03c0k/N )\n(2)\nS=\n\nZ\n\nd4 x\n\n(\u2212\n\nwhere k = 0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1, and diagonal gauge coupling is g42 = g52 /R.\nThe above-mentioned observation also triggered our intuition to utilize\nnoncommutative geometry (NCG) method to study scalar potential in ACGmodel because the dynamics of Yang-Mills field is geometric and the (differential) geometry of lattices is a specification of NCG. In fact, the first attempt\nto adopt NCG in ACG-model was explored by M. Alishahiha 3 whose concern\nis concentrated mainly on gravity.\n2\n\n\f2\n2.1\n\nNoncommutative Yang-Mills theory on cyclic groups\nNoncommutative geometry on cyclic groups\n\nA comprehensive introduction to NCG can be found in 4 . NCG on a cyclic\ngroup can be characterized by a generalized Dirac operator. Let ZN be N -order\ncyclic group, then Dirac operator on ZN is defined to be D[\u03c9] = \u03c9\u0304T b\u2020 +T \u2020 b\u03c9 in\nwhich T is the induced translation acting on functions over ZN , b, b\u2020 is a pair\nof fermionic annihilation/creation operators, and \u03c9 is so-called link variable\nbeing parametrized by \u03c9 = \u03c1ei\u03b8 . Under a gauge transformation U , which is a\nunitary function on ZN , \u03c9 \u2192 (T U )\u03c9U \u2020 . Two gauge covariants, which are the\ncandidates of generalized field strength, are defined by\nF1 := D[\u03c9]2 = T \u2020 (\u03c6)bb\u2020 + \u03c6b\u2020 b, F2 := \u2202 \u2020 (\u03c6)b \u2227 b\u2020 =: D[\u03c9] \u2227 D[\u03c9]\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\nin which \u03c6 := \u03c1 , and the formal partial derivative \u2202 := T \u2212 Id.\n2.2\n\nDynamics of Dirac operator\n\nThanks for ACG's observation, the following identifications can be carried out.\nFirstly, the N -site lattice generated dynamically in ACG-model is identified\nwith ZN ; secondly, Ui,i+1 is identified with \u03c9; last and most importantly, scalar\npotential in action (1) is identified with Yang-Mills action on ZN . Below three\ntypes of Yang-Mills actions will be constructed.\nVI = T r(F12 )\nP\nAfter a representation for b, b\u2020 being specified, VI \u223c i\u2208ZN \u03c6(i)2 , whose equation of motion admits only zero solution obviously; consequently, no spontaneous symmetry broken happens under this construction.\nVII = T r(F22 )\nIntroduce a lattice laplacian \u25b3 = \u2202\u2202 \u2020 , then\nX\nVII \u223c\n\u03c6(i)(\u25b3\u03c6)(i)\ni\u2208ZN\n\nEquation of motion is read as\n\u03c1\u25b3\u03c6=0\nwhose nontrivial solutions are constant functions. This fact can be understood\nschematically by the extremal value principle in commutative harmonic analysis 5 . This class of solutions describes flat directions, because for any of them\nthe potential energy equals to zero.\n3\n\n\fVIII = 21 T r(F22 + \u03b14 F12 \u2212 \u03b22 F1 )\nwhere the coupling constants \u03b1 \u2265 0. Note that the last term in VIII is called\nSitarz term 6 , which vanishes in continuum limit if there exists such a limit.\nThe equation of motion is given by\n\u03c1(2t\u03c6 \u2212 T (\u03c6) \u2212 T \u2020 (\u03c6) \u2212 \u03b2) = 0\nwhere t := (2 + \u03b1)/2 \u2265 1. In any circumstance, there exists at least a zero\nsolution. It is easy to see that if \u03b2 < 0, \u03b1 \u2265 0 or \u03b2 = 0, \u03b1 > 0, the zero solution\nis the minimum of VIII , which implies that no SSB happens. So below only\ncase \u03b2 > 0, \u03b1 \u2265 0 will be considered.\n\u03b2\n, \u2200i \u2208 ZN , \u03b1 > 0;\nTranslation invariant solution (ACG phase) \u03c6(i) = \u03b1\nno solution exists for \u03b1 = 0 in this case. Energy is computed to be VIII =\n\u2212N \u03b2 2 /\u03b1 =: VNinv .

With VI , no SSB happens; with VII , there appears a random balance;\nfor ACG phase from VIII , scenario of ACG is recovered; nontrivial phase from\nVIII is a distinctively novel pattern, which will be the real vacuum in strong\ncoupling range of \u03b1 when N = 4.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by Climb-Up (Pan Deng) Project of Department of\nScience and Technology in China, Chinese National Science Foundation and\nDoctoral Programme Foundation of Institution of Higher Education in China.\nReferences\n1.
