Partially ordered sets labeled with k labels (k-posets) and their\nhomomorphisms are examined. We give a representation of directed graphs by\nk-posets; this provides a new proof of the universality of the homomorphism\norder of k-posets. This universal order is a distributive lattice. We investigate\nsome other properties, namely the infinite distributivity, the computation of\ninfinite suprema and infima, and the complexity of certain decision problems\ninvolving the homomorphism order of k-posets. Sublattices are also examined.\n\n1. Introduction\nA partially ordered set labeled with k labels (k-poset), also known as a partially\nordered multiset (pomset) or a partial word, is an object (P ; \u2264, c), where (P ; \u2264) is\na partially ordered set and c is a function that assigns to each element of P a label\nfrom the set {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1}. A homomorphism between k-posets is a mapping\nh : (P ; \u2264, c) \u2192 (P \u2032 ; \u2264\u2032 , c\u2032 ) that preserves both order and labels. A quasiorder,\ncalled the homomorphism quasiorder, can be defined on the set of all k-posets as\nfollows: (P ; \u2264, c) \u2264 (P \u2032 ; \u2264\u2032 , c\u2032 ) if and only if there is a homomorphism of (P ; \u2264, c)\nto (P \u2032 ; \u2264\u2032 , c\u2032 ).\nLabeled posets have been used as a model of parallel processes (see Pratt [19]),\nand they can be viewed as a generalization of strings. Algebraic properties of labeled\nposets have been studied by Grabowski [6], Gischer [5], Bloom and \u00c9sik [1], and\nRensink [21]. Homomorphisms of k-posets were studied in the context of Boolean\nhierarchies of partitions by Kosub [12], Kosub and Wagner [13], and Selivanov\n[22]. Kuske [15] and Kudinov and Selivanov [14] studied the undecidability of the\nfirst-order theory of the homomorphism quasiorder of k-posets. The second author\napplied k-posets to analyse substitution instances of operations on finite sets when\nthe inner functions are monotone functions (with respect to some fixed partial order\non the base set) [16] and showed that for k \u2265 2, the homomorphism order of finite\nk-posets is a distributive lattice which is universal in the sense that it admits an\nembedding of every countable poset [17]. But these are not complete lattices.\nThe current paper continues the investigation of some properties and sublattices\nof the homomorphism order of k-posets. We establish a representation of directed\ngraphs by k-posets, which gives rise to a new proof of the universality of the homomorphism order of k-posets and enables us to study the complexity of certain\ndecision problems related to k-posets. We are also interested in computing with\ninfinite suprema and infima. In particular we examine join-infinite distributivity\n(JID) and its dual, meet-infinite distributivity (MID); these are special cases of\ncomplete infinite distributivity (CID). These properties are defined by the following identities:\nThis research was partially supported by the Academy of Finland, grant #120307.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nL\u00c9ONARD KWUIDA AND ERKKO LEHTONEN\n\nW\nW\nJID: x \u2227 V{xi | i \u2208 I} = V{x \u2227 xi | i \u2208 I},\nMID: V\nx\b\u2228W {xi | i \u2208 I} = {x \u2228 xW\n\u2208 I},\ni |\biV\nCID:\n{aij | j \u2208 J} | i \u2208 I =\n{ai\u03c6(i) | i \u2208 I} \u03c6 : I \u2192 J ,\nfor I, J 6= \u2205.\n2. Labeled posets and homomorphisms\nFor a positive natural number k, a partially ordered set labeled with k labels (kposet ) is an object (P ; \u2264, c), where (P ; \u2264) is a partially ordered set and c : P \u2192\n{0, 1, . . . , k \u22121} is a labeling function. A labeled poset is a k-poset for some k. Every\nsubset P \u2032 of a k-poset (P ; \u2264, c) may be considered as a k-poset (P \u2032 ; \u2264|P \u2032 , c|P \u2032 ),\ncalled a k-subposet of (P ; \u2264, c). We often simplify these notations and write (P, c)\nor P instead of (P ; \u2264, c), and we simply write c for the restriction c|S of c to any\nsubset S of its domain. If the underlying poset of a k-poset is a lattice, chain, tree,\nor forest, then we refer to k-lattices, k-chains, k-trees, k-forests, and so on. For\nk \u2264 l, every k-poset is also an l-poset. Finite k-posets can be represented by Hasse\ndiagrams with numbers designating the labels assigned to each element; see the\nvarious figures of this paper. For general background on partially ordered sets and\nlattices, see any textbook on the subject, e.g., [3, 7].\nA k-chain a1 < a2 < * * * < an with labeling c is alternating, if c(ai ) 6= c(ai+1 ) for\nall 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1. The alternation number of a k-poset (P, c), denoted Alt(P, c), is\nthe cardinality of the longest alternating k-chain that is a k-subposet of (P, c).\nWe will adopt much of the terminology used for graphs and their homomorphisms\n(see [10]). (Recall that a graph homomorphism h : G \u2192 G\u2032 is an edge-preserving\nmapping between the vertex sets of graphs G and G\u2032 . A core is a graph that\ndoes not admit a homomorphism to any proper subgraph of itself.) Let (P, c)\nand (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ) be k-posets. A mapping h : P \u2192 P \u2032 that preserves both ordering\nand labels (i.e., h(x) \u2264 h(y) in P \u2032 whenever x \u2264 y in P , and c = c\u2032 \u25e6 h) is\ncalled a homomorphism of (P, c) to (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ) and denoted h : (P, c) \u2192 (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ). The\ncomposition of homomorphisms is again a homomorphism. An endomorphism of\n(P, c) is a homomorphism h : (P, c) \u2192 (P, c). If a homomorphism h : (P, c) \u2192\n(P \u2032 , c\u2032 ) is bijective and the inverse of h is a homomorphism of (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ) to (P, c), then\nh is called an isomorphism, and (P, c) and (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ) are said to be isomorphic.\nWe denote by Pk and Lk the classes of all finite k-posets and k-lattices, respectively. We define a quasiorder \u2264 on Pk as follows: (P, c) \u2264 (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ) if and only if\nthere is a homomorphism of (P, c) to (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ). Denote by \u2261 the equivalence relation\non Pk induced by \u2264. If (P, c) \u2261 (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ), we say that (P, c) and (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ) are homomorphically equivalent. We denote by P\u0303k the quotient set Pk /\u2261, and the partial\norder on P\u0303k induced by the homomorphism quasiorder \u2264 is also denoted by \u2264. The\nquasiorder \u2264 and the equivalence relation \u2261 can be restricted to Lk , and we denote\nby L\u0303k the quotient set Lk /\u2261.\nThe homomorphic equivalence class of (P, c) \u2208 Pk is denoted by [(P, c)] =\n{(P \u2032 , c\u2032 ) \u2208 Pk | (P, c) \u2261 (P \u2032 , c\u2032 )}. We tend to identify the \u2261-classes by their\nrepresentatives; that is, whenever we say that (P, c) is an element of P\u0303k , it is to be\nunderstood as referring to the \u2261-class [(P, c)].\nA k-poset (P, c) is a core, if all endomorphisms of (P, c) are surjective (equivalently, if (P, c) is not homomorphically equivalent to any k-poset of smaller cardinality). Every k-poset is homomorphically equivalent to a core. Isomorphic kposets are homomorphically equivalent by definition.

Directed graph G and its representation by a 2-poset PG .\nk-posets are not necessarily isomorphic, but homomorphically equivalent cores are\nisomorphic. Thus we can take the cores as representatives of the homomorphic\nequivalence classes, and the restriction of the quasiorder \u2264 on Pk to the set of cores\nis isomorphic to (P\u0303k , \u2264).\nTwo elements a and b of a poset P are connected, if there exists a sequence\na1 , . . . , an of elements of P such that a1 = a, an = b, and for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1\neither ai \u2264 ai+1 or ai \u2265 ai+1 . A nonempty poset is connected if all pairs of its\nelements are connected. A connected component of a poset P is a subposet C \u2286 P\nthat is connected and such that for every x \u2208 P \\ C the subposet C \u222a {x} is not\nconnected. It is easy to verify that all homomorphic images of a connected poset\nare connected. A k-poset is a core if and only if all its connected components are\ncores and pairwise incomparable under \u2264.\n3. Representation of directed graphs by k-posets\nLet G = (V, E) be a directed graph. We associate with G a 2-poset PG :=\n(P ; \u2264, c), where P := (V \u222a E) \u00d7 {0, 1}, and c(a, b) = b for all a \u2208 V \u222a E, b \u2208 {0, 1},\nand the covering relations of \u2264 are exactly the following:\n\u2022 (a, 0) < (a, 1) for all a \u2208 V ,\n\u2022 (a, 1) < (a, 0) for all a \u2208 E,\n\u2022 for each edge (u, v) \u2208 E, (u, 0) < ((u, v), 0), ((u, v), 1) < (v, 1).\nIt is clear from the construction that if G is a subgraph of H, then PG is a k-subposet\nof PH . See Figure 1 for an example of a directed graph and its representation by a\n2-poset.\nProposition 3.1. Let G and H be directed graphs. Then G is homomorphic to H\nif and only if PG is homomorphic to PH .\nProof. Let h : G \u2192 H be a graph homomorphism. Then the mapping g : PG \u2192\nPH defined as g(v, b) = (h(v), b) for all v \u2208 V (G), b \u2208 {0, 1}; g((u, v), b) =\n((h(u), h(v)), b) for all (u, v) \u2208 E(G), b \u2208 {0, 1}, is easily seen to be a homomorphism. Clearly g preserves the labels, and in order to show that g(x) \u2264 g(y) in PH\nwhenever x \u2264 y in PG we have four cases to consider; recall that if (u, v) \u2208 E(G),\nthen (h(u), h(v)) \u2208 E(H).\n\u2022 If x = (u, 0), y = (u, 1) where u \u2208 V (G), then g(x) = g(u, 0) = (h(u), 0) <\n(h(u), 1) = g(u, 1) = g(y).\n\n\f4\n\nL\u00c9ONARD KWUIDA AND ERKKO LEHTONEN\n\n2\n\u2022\n\n. ..\n.... ......\n....\n....\n...\n....\n....\n....\n.\n.\n.\n....\n...\n.\n.\n...\n.\n.......\n...\n..\n.... ...\n.... ......\n.... ....\n.\n.\n.\n... .....\n....\n....\n.\n....\n...\n.\n.... .....\n...\n...\n......\n..\n...\n...\n... ......\n.\n.\n...\n...\n.\n...\n...\n.\n.\n.\n...\n.\n.... ....\n.\n.... ..\n... ......\n.... ..\n.........\n....\n......\n..\n....\n....\n....\n....\n....\n....\n.\n....\n.\n.... ......\n.........\n\n1\u2022\n\n\u20220\n\n0\u2022\n\n\u20221\n\n\u2022\n2\n\nFigure 2.

Since alternating chains\nmust be mapped to isomorphic alternating chains by homomorphisms, we have\nthat there are mappings h : V (G) \u2192 V (H), e : E(G) \u2192 E(H) such that g(v, b) =\n(h(v), b) and g((u, v), b) = (e(u, v), b) for all v \u2208 V (G), (u, v) \u2208 E(G), b \u2208 {0, 1}.\nFurthermore, the comparabilities (u, 0) < ((u, v), 0), ((u, v), 1) < (v, 1) in PG must\nbe preserved by g for all edges (u, v) \u2208 E(G), that is, (h(u), 0) = g(u, 0) <\ng((u, v), 0) = (e(u, v), 0) and (e(u, v), 1) = g((u, v), 1) < g(v, 1) = (h(v), 1). Therefore, e(u, v) \u2208 E(H) equals (h(u), h(v)). We conclude that h is a homomorphism\nof G to H.\n\u0003\nProposition 3.2. Let G be a graph. Then PG is a core if and only if G is a core.\nProof. If PG is a core, then it is not homomorphic to any of its proper k-subposets.\nIn particular, by Proposition 3.1, there is no proper subgraph H of G such that\nPG is homomorphic to PH . Thus, G does not retract to any proper subgraph, and\nhence G is a core.\nIf PG is not a core, then there is a homomorphism h : PG \u2192 P \u2032 for some proper\nk-subposet P \u2032 = Im h of PG . It is clear from the proof of Proposition 3.1 that the\nhomomorphic image P \u2032 of PG is of the form PH for some graph H. Then H is a\nproper subgraph and a retract of G, and so G is not a core.\n\u0003\nWe describe a variant of the above representation of directed graphs by labeled\nposets. We associate with each directed graph G the 3-poset LG , which is defined\nlike PG but with a greatest element and a least element adjoined. The two new\nelements have label 2. (For the empty graph \u2205, we agree that L\u2205 is the empty\n3-poset.) It is easy to see that LG is a 3-lattice if and only if G is loopless. (A\nsingle loop gives rise to the 3-poset shown in Figure 2, which is not a 3-lattice.)\nProposition 3.3. Let G and H be directed graphs. Then G is homomorphic to H\nif and only if LG is homomorphic to LH .\n\n\fON THE HOMOMORPHISM ORDER OF LABELED POSETS\n\n5\n\nProof. The proof is similar to that of Proposition 3.1. We only need to observe\nthat the greatest and least elements are the only elements with label 2, and every\nhomomorphism must map the greatest and least elements to the greatest and least\nelements, respectively. Otherwise homomorphisms act as described in the proof of\nProposition 3.1.\n\u0003\nProposition 3.4. Let G be a graph. Then LG is a core if and only if G is a core.\nProof. The proof is similar to that of Proposition 3.2.\n\n\u0003\n\nA countable poset is universal if every countable poset can be embedded into it.\nWe established in [17] that the posets P\u0303k (k \u2265 2) and L\u0303k (k \u2265 3) are universal. Our\nrepresentation of directed graphs by 2-posets and that of loopless directed graphs\nby 3-lattices provides a new proof of this fact.\nTheorem 3.5. The posets P\u0303k (k \u2265 2) and L\u0303k (k \u2265 3) are universal.\nProof. It is a well-known fact that the homomorphism order of (loopless) directed\ngraphs is universal (see [20]; see also Hubi\u010dka and Ne\u0161et\u0159il's [11] simpler proof).\nThe claim then follows from Propositions 3.1 and 3.3.\n\u0003\nHow hard is it to find homomorphisms between k-posets? The k-poset representation of directed graphs given above allows us to transfer some complexity results\nfrom directed graphs to k-posets. We represent directed graphs by k-posets in such\na way that there is a homomorphism between graphs if and only if there is homomorphism between their k-poset representations. This representation enables us to\nprove the NP-completeness of certain decision problems related to k-posets. More\nprecisely, we will show that the problem of deciding whether there exists a homomorphism between two k-posets and the problem of deciding whether a k-poset\nadmits a nonsurjective endomorphism are NP-complete.\nWe define the k-poset homomorphism problem k-HOM and the k-poset noncoreness problem k-CORE as follows. Note that cores are precisely the k-posets\nfor which the answer to the question of k-CORE is no.\nProblem k-HOM\nInstance: k-posets (P, c) and (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ).\nQuestion: Is there a homomorphism (P, c) \u2192 (P \u2032 , c\u2032 )?\nProblem k-CORE\nInstance: A k-poset (P, c).\nQuestion: Is there a nonsurjective endomorphism of (P, c)?\nk-HOM and k-CORE are analogues of the graph homomorphicity problem\nHOM and the graph non-coreness problem CORE, defined as follows.\nProblem HOM\nInstance: Graphs G and G\u2032 .\nQuestion: Is there a homomorphism G \u2192 G\u2032 ?\nProblem CORE\nInstance: A graph G.\nQuestion: Is there a nonsurjective homomorphism G \u2192 G?\nIt is an easy exercise to show that both k-HOM and k-CORE are NP-complete,\nusing the well-known fact that HOM and CORE are NP-complete [8, 9] and the\nrepresentation of graphs by labeled posets as described in Section 3.\n\n\f6\n\nL\u00c9ONARD KWUIDA AND ERKKO LEHTONEN\n\nIt follows from Proposition 3.3 that k-HOM remains NP-complete even when\nits inputs are restricted to k-lattices for k \u2265 3. However, for 2-lattices, k-HOM\nis solvable in polynomial time. For, it was shown by Kosub and Wagner [13] that\nevery 2-lattice is homomorphically equivalent to its longest alternating chain. For\neach n \u2265 1, there are exactly two nonisomorphic alternating 2-chains of cardinality\nn, and these are fully described by the length n and the label of the least element.\nThus a 2-lattice (L, c) is homomorphic to a 2-lattice (L\u2032 , c\u2032 ) if and only if Alt(L, c) <\nAlt(L\u2032 , c\u2032 ) or Alt(L, c) = Alt(L\u2032 , c\u2032 ) and the least elements of (L, c) and (L\u2032 , c\u2032 ) have\nthe same label. It is an easy exercise to show that the alternation number of a finite\nk-poset can be determined in polynomial time.\nConsider also the k-poset (Q, d)-homomorphicity problem k-(Q, d)-HOM, defined as follows. Here (H, d) is a fixed k-poset and we should decide whether a\ngiven k-poset is homomorphic to (H, d).\nProblem k-(Q, d)-HOM\nInstance: A k-poset (P, c).\nQuestion: Is there a homomorphism (P, c) \u2192 (Q, d)?\nThis is an analogue of the graph H-colouring problem H-HOM, defined as follows.\nProblem H-HOM\nInstance: A graph G.\nQuestion: Is there a homomorphism G \u2192 H?\nIt is clear that k-(Q, d)-HOM is in NP for any k-poset (Q, d). It was shown\nby Hell and Ne\u0161et\u0159il [8] that H-HOM is NP-complete for any non-bipartite graph\nH, and it is polynomial-time solvable for any bipartite graph H. Thus, there are\nNP-complete cases of k-(Q, d)-HOM, e.g., the cases where (Q, d) = PG for some\nnonbipartite graph G. There are also polynomial-time solvable cases, e.g., the\ncases where the labeling d in (Q, d) is a constant function-it only suffices to check\nwhether the labeling c of the input (P, c) is constant function taking on the same\nvalue as d, and this can certainly be decided in polynomial time.\nIt remains an open question whether there is a dichotomy between the polynomial-time solvable and NP-complete cases of k-(Q, d)-HOM, analogously to that\nof H-HOM.\n4. Properties of the homomorphism order of k-posets\nThe homomorphism order of k-posets forms a distributive lattice with disjoint\nunion as join, and label-matching product as meet [17]. The disjoint union of a\nfamily (Si )i\u2208I of sets is defined as the set\nS\n* Si = {(i, x) | i \u2208 I, x \u2208 Si }.\ni\u2208I\n\nS\nIf I = {1, 2}, then we write S1 \u222a* S2 for * i\u2208{1,2} Si . The disjoint union of a family\nS\nS\n= ( * i\u2208I Pi , d), where\n(Pi , ci )i\u2208I of k-posets is defined toSbe the k-poset * i\u2208I (Pi , ci ) S\nd(i, x) = ci (x) for all (i, x) \u2208 * i\u2208I Pi , and the order on * i\u2208I Pi is defined as\n(i, x) \u2264 (j, y) if and only if i = j and x \u2264 y in Pi .\nThe label-matching\nproduct of a family (Pi , ci )i\u2208I of k-posets is defined to be the\nN\nk-poset i\u2208I (Pi , ci ) := (Q, d), where\nY\nQ := {(ai )i\u2208I \u2208\nPi | ci (ai ) = cj (aj ) for all i, j \u2208 I},\ni\u2208I\n\n\fON THE HOMOMORPHISM ORDER OF LABELED POSETS\n\n7\n\n(ai )i\u2208I \u2264 (bi )i\u2208I in Q if and only if ai \u2264 bi in Pi for all i \u2208 I, and the labeling is\ndefined by d((ai )i\u2208I ) = ci (ai ) for some i \u2208 I (the choice of i does not\nNmatter by the\ndefinition of Q). If I = {1, 2}, then we write (P1 , c1 ) \u2297 (P2 , c2 ) for i\u2208{1,2} (Pi , ci ).\n\nIt was shown in [17] that (P\u0303k , \u2264) is a distributive lattice with the lattice operations defined as follows:\n* \u2032 , c\u2032 ),\n(P, c) \u2228 (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ) = (P, c) \u222a(P\n\nand\n\n(P, c) \u2227 (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ) = (P, c) \u2297 (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ).\n\nHere the lattice operations are defined in terms of equivalence class representatives.\nProposition 4.1. The join-irreducible elements of (P\u0303k , \u2264) are (the equivalence\nclasses of ) the cores with at most one connected component.\nProof. The empty k-poset is the smallest element of P\u0303k , so it is clearly joinirreducible. We can then assume that (P, c) is a nonempty core. Let (P1 , c1 ), . . . ,\n(Pn , cn ) be the connected components of (P, c). These connected component are\ncores and they are pairwise incomparable under \u2264. If n > 1, then (P, c) is the\ndisjoint union of its connected components and thus it is not join-irreducible.\nAssume then that n = 1. Suppose, on the contrary, that (P, c) is not joinirreducible. Then there exist cores (Q1 , d1 ) and (Q2 , d2 ) that are not equivalent\n* 2 , d2 ). Thus there exist homomorphisms\nto (P, c) such that (P, c) \u2261 (Q1 , d1 ) \u222a(Q\n* 2 , d2 ) and g : (Q1 , d1 ) \u222a(Q\n* 2 , d2 ) \u2192 (P, d). Since (P, c) is\nh : (P, c) \u2192 (Q1 , d1 ) \u222a(Q\nconnected, h is in fact a homomorphism of (P, c) to (Q1 , d1 ) or to (Q2 , d2 ). Furthermore, for i = 1, 2, the restriction of g to Qi is a homomorphism of (Qi , di ) to\n(P, c). Thus, (P, c) is homomorphically equivalent to either (Q1 , d1 ) or (Q2 , d2 ), a\ncontradiction.\n\u0003\nDenote by Jk the set of join-irreducible elements of the lattice (P\u0303k , \u2264), which\nwe just showed to be the set of cores with at most one connected component.\nSince every finite core has only a finite number of connected components and is the\nsupremum of its connected components, we conclude that every element of P\u0303k is\nthe join of a finite number of elements of Jk . Hence Jk is a join-dense subset of P\u0303k .\nAs we have mentioned already, P\u0303k is not complete. The smallest complete poset\n(lattice) containing P\u0303k is its Dedekind-MacNeille completion. One way to construct\nit is to take the set of normal ideals of P\u0303k ordered\u0001 by inclusion [18]\n\u0001 or to take the\nconcept lattices of the formal contexts P\u0303k , P\u0303k , \u2264 or Jk , P\u0303k , \u2264 [4]. We denote\nby P\u0302k the Dedekind-MacNeille completion of P\u0303k . Note that P\u0303k is join-dense and\nmeet-dense in P\u0302k . Then Jk is a join-dense subset of P\u0302k . Is P\u0302k an algebraic W\nlattice?\nRecall that an element a of a complete\nlattice\nL\nis\ncalled\ncompact\nif\na\n\u2264\nX for\nW\nsome X \u2286 L implies that a \u2264 X1 for some finite X1 \u2286 X, and that a complete\nlattice L is called algebraic or compactly generated if every element is the join of\ncompact elements. More generally, is the MacNeille completion of any compactly\ngenerated lattice also compactly generated? Before we answer this question, we first\ninvestigate a subposet of P\u0302k in which we can compute all suprema and infima of\nelements of P\u0303k .\nWe are looking for posets containing P\u0303k as subposet in which we can compute\nall suprema and infima of elements of P\u0303k . Since P\u0303k is countably infinite, each\ncompletion should contain at least the countable unions of finite k-posets. Since\nany countable union of finite sets is again countable, we will start by enlarging a bit\nthe class P\u0303k . We denote by Pk\u03c9 the class of countable k-posets. The homomorphism\nquasi-order on Pk\u03c9 is defined in the same way as for finite k-posets and it induces a\n\n\f8\n\nL\u00c9ONARD KWUIDA AND ERKKO LEHTONEN\n\npartial order on the quotient Pk\u03c9 /\u2261, which we will denote by P\u0303k\u03c9 . A poset (P, \u2264)\nis called \u03c9-complete 1 if the suprema and infima of countable subsets of P exist. For\ncountable posets, completeness and \u03c9-completeness coincide.\nLemma 4.2. The poset (Pk\u03c9 , \u2264) is \u03c9-complete.\nProof. Suprema and infima will be constructed as in [17]. Let (Pt , ct )t\u2208T be a\ncountable family of elements of Pk\u03c9 . Define a k-poset (P\u0304 , c) as the disjoint unions\nof (Pt , ct )'s, i.e.,\nS\nP\u0304 := * Pt and c(t, a) = ct (a).\nt\u2208T\n\nThen P\u0304 is countable and (P\u0304 , c) is in Pk\u03c9 . Moreover (P\u0304 , c) is the supremum of\n(Pt , ct )t\u2208T . In fact, it is clear that each inclusion map \u03c4t : Pt \u2192 P\u0304 , x 7\u2192 (t, x)\nis a homomorphism of k-posets; if (Pt , ct ) \u2264 (Q, d), then there are k-poset homomorphisms ht : Pt \u2192 Q for each t \u2208 T ; define h : P\u0304 \u2192 Q by h(t, p) := ht (p), for\nevery t \u2208 T and p \u2208 Pt . The mapping h is a k-poset homomorphism and thus\n(P\u0304 , c) \u2264 (Q, d). Therefore (P\u0304 , c) is the supremum of (P\n\u0001 t , ct )t\u2208T . For the infimum,\nconsider the label-matching product (P\u0303 , c\u0303) of (Pt , ct ) t\u2208T given by:\nY\nP\u0303 := {a \u2208\nPt | ct (at ) = cs (as ) for all s, t \u2208 T } and c\u0303(a) := ct (at ).\nt\u2208T\n\nP\u0303 keeps only the elements having the same label on all components and sets this\nas its label. Of course the projections \u03c0t : (P\u0303 , c\u0303) \u2192 (Pt , ct ), a 7\u2192 at (t \u2208 T ) are\nk-poset homomorphisms; thus (P\u0303 , c\u0303) \u2264 (Pt , ct ) for all t \u2208 T . If (Q, d) \u2264 (Pt , ct )\nfor all t \u2208 T , then there are k-poset\nhomomorphisms gt : (Q, d) \u2192 (Pt , ct ). Define\n\u0001\ng : Q \u2192 P\u0303 by g(q) := gt (q) t\u2208T . Then g is a homomorphism of k-posets, and\n(Q, d) \u2264 (P\u0303 , c\u0303).\n\u0003\nAs an \u03c9-complete poset, (P\u0303k\u03c9 , \u2264) is a lattice containing (P\u0303k , \u2264) as a sublattice,\nin which all suprema and infima of P\u0303k exist. An \u03c9-complete poset (P, \u2264) is called\n\u03c9-join-distributive (\u03c9-meet-distributive) if for any index set T of cardinality at most\n\u03c9, for any family (at )t\u2208T of elements of P and for any b \u2208 P , we have\n_\n_\nb\u2227\nat =\n(b \u2227 at )\nt\u2208T\n\n( b\u2228\n\n^\n\nt\u2208T\n\nt\u2208T\n\nat =\n\n^\n\n(b \u2228 at ),\n\nrespectively).\n\nt\u2208T\n\nIf an \u03c9-complete poset is both \u03c9-join- and \u03c9-meet-distributive, we call it \u03c9-distributive 2. The \u03c9-complete poset (P\u0303k\u03c9 , \u2264) is \u03c9-distributive as we can see from Lemmas 4.3 and 4.4.\nLemma 4.3. The \u03c9-complete poset (P\u0303k\u03c9 , \u2264) is \u03c9-join-distributive.\nProof. Let b := (Q, d) \u2208 P\u0303k\u03c9 and (Pt , ct )t\u2208T be a countable family of elements\nof P\u0303k\u03c9 . We set at := (Pt , ct ). To show that (P\u0303k\u03c9 , \u2264) is \u03c9-join-distributive, we\n1This notion can be generalized to \u03ba-completeness for any cardinal \u03ba as follows: a poset (P, \u2264)\nis \u03ba-complete if the suprema and infima of subsets of cardinality at most \u03ba exist in P .\n2Replacing \u03c9 with \u03ba gives \u03ba-distributivity. This is a generalization of distributivity (\u03ba = 2).\nFor finite cardinals \u03ba, the notions of \u03ba-join-distributivity, \u03ba-meet-distributivity and distributivity\nare equivalent.

As regards\n\u0001\nNpreservation of order,\n* t , ct ) .\nlet Xl = (ilt , xlt )t\u2208T (l = 1, 2), and assume that X1 \u2264 X2 in t\u2208T (Q, d) \u222a(P\n* t , ct ) for all t \u2208 T , which in turn implies that\nThen (i1t , x1t ) \u2264 (i2t , x2t ) in (Q, d) \u222a(P\ni1t = i2t and x1t \u2264 x2t (in (Q, d) or in (Pt , ct ), depending on the value of i1t ) for all\nt \u2208 T . Thus the sets\nSl = {t \u2208 T | ilt = 1} (l = 1, 2)\nare equal. Hence either h(Xl ) = (2, (xlt )t\u2208T ) for l = 1, 2 or h(Xl ) = (1, xlj ) for\nl = 1, 2, where j = min S1 = min S2 . In both cases it is obvious that h(X1 ) \u2264\nh(X2 ).\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nL\u00c9ONARD KWUIDA AND ERKKO LEHTONEN\n\nTheorem 4.5. Let (at )t\u2208T be a family of elements of P\u0303k , and let b \u2208 P\u0303k . If (at )t\u2208T\nhas a supremum in P\u0303k , then the family (b \u2227 at )t\u2208T has a supremum in P\u0303k , and it\nholds that\n_\n_\nb\u2227\nat =\n(b \u2227 at ).\nt\u2208T\n\nt\u2208T\n\nSimilarly, if (at )t\u2208T has an infimum in P\u0303k , then the family (b \u2227 at )t\u2208T has an\ninfimum in P\u0303k , and it holds that\n^\n^\nb\u2228\nat =\n(b \u2228 at ).\nt\u2208T\n\nt\u2208T\n\nProof. The claim follows from Lemmas 4.3 and 4.4 and the fact that we are dealing\nwith finite k-posets only.\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.6. (P\u0303k\u03c9 , \u2264) is a distributive lattice.\nProposition 4.7. The cores with at most one connected component are compact\nand prime elements of (P\u0303k\u03c9 , \u2264).\nW\nProof. Let a \u2208 Jk and X \u2286 P\u0303k\u03c9 such that a \u2264 X. As P\u0303k is countable and\njoin-dense in P\u0303k\u03c9 , we can assume\nlooking for a finite\nW that X is countable. We\nW are W\nsubset X1 \u2286 X such that a \u2264 X1 . We have a = a \u2227 X = {a \u2227 x | x \u2208 X},\nby\nS the \u03c9-join-distributivity. Therefore there is a k-poset homomorphism \u03c6 : a \u2192\n* {a \u2297 x | x \u2208 X}. Since a is connected, \u03c6(a) is also connected and there is an\nx0 \u2208 X such that \u03c6(a) \u2286 a \u2297 x0 . Thus \u03c6 is a k-poset homomorphism from a to\na \u2297 x0 , i.e., a \u2264 a \u2227 x0 . Therefore we can let X1 := {x0 } \u2286 X.\n\u0003\nAll elements of P\u0303k are finite joins of elements of Jk , and are hence compact in\nP\u0303k\u03c9 . Are they also compact in the MacNeille completion P\u0302k of P\u0303k ? This is still an\nopen question, and seems to be intimately related with the distributivity of P\u0302k . A\npositive answer will say that P\u0302k is an algebraic lattice.\n5. Bounded k-posets with fixed labels at the extreme points\nRecall that we denote by Lk the set of all k-lattices and we denote L\u0303k = Lk /\u2261.\nL\u0303k is clearly a subposet of P\u0303k , but it is not a sublattice of P\u0303k , for the simple reason\nthat the disjoint union of two incomparable k-lattices is not (homomorphically\nequivalent to) a k-lattice. Even if we consider the subposet of P\u0303k consisting of (the\nequivalence classes of) those k-posets whose connected components are lattices, we\ndo not have a sublattice nor even a meet-subsemilattice of P\u0303k . This is due to the fact\nthat the label-matching product of two k-lattices is generally not (homomorphically\nequivalent to) a k-lattice, as Figure 3 illustrates. An identical argument shows that\nk-trees do not constitute a sublattice of P\u0303k , and neither do k-forests (k-posets whose\nconnected components are k-trees).\nIn this section, we will consider families of bounded k-posets with fixed labels\non their extreme points. These families constitute meet-subsemilattices of P\u0303k . We\nwill describe the suprema within these families, and we establish that these families\nconstitute universal distributive lattices under the homomorphism order.\nLet k \u2265 1, and let a, b \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1}. Denote by Pkab the set of finite\nbounded k-posets (P, c) with a largest element \u22a4 and a smallest element \u22a5 such\nthat c(\u22a4) = a and c(\u22a5) = b. Denote P \u2020 := P \\ {\u22a4, \u22a5}. Again, denote by P\u0303kab the\nquotient Pkab /\u2261.\n\n\fON THE HOMOMORPHISM ORDER OF LABELED POSETS\n\n2\n\u2022.....\n\n2\n\u2022.....\n..\n...\n..\n...\n..\n...\n...\n...\n...\n..\n...\n...\n...\n...\n.\n\n0\u2022\n1\u2022\n\u2022\n0\n\n\u2297\n\n..\n...\n..\n...\n..\n...\n...\n...\n...\n..\n...\n...\n...\n...\n.\n\n\u20221\n\n11\n\n2\n\u2022\n\n=\n\n\u20220\n\u2022\n1\n\n.....\n.... .......\n....\n....\n....\n....\n...\n.\n....\n.\n.\n....\n...\n.\n.........\n.....\n.\n... ..\n.... .......\n.... ....\n.\n.\n... .....\n.\n...\n....\n.\n....\n...\n.\n.... .....\n...\n...\n.....\n...\n...\n..........\n.\n.\n...\n...\n.\n....\n.\n....\n..\n... .......\n.... ...\n... .....\n.... ...\n.........\n.....\n..\n\n1\u2022\n\n\u20220\n\n\u2022\n0\n\n\u2022\n\n1\n\nFigure 3. The label-matching product of k-lattices is not generally a k-lattice.\nLet (P, c), (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ) \u2208 Pkab . It is easy to verify that the label-matching product\n(P, c) \u2297 (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ) is again in Pkab , and hence P\u0303kab is a meet-subsemilattice of P\u0303k .\n* \u2032 , c\u2032 ) is generally not a bounded\nHowever, the core of the disjoint union (P, c) \u222a(P\nk-poset, and hence we need to verify if (P, c) and (P \u2032 , c\u2032 ) have an infimum in P\u0303kab .\nDefine the binary operation \u228e on Pkab as follows. For i = 1, 2, let (Pi , ci ) \u2208\nab\nPk , and let \u22a4Pi and \u22a5Pi be the largest and smallest elements of Pi . We let\n(P1 , c1 ) \u228e (P2 , c2 ) = (Q, d), where\nQ = (P1\u2020 \u222a* P2\u2020 ) \u222a {\u22a4Q , \u22a5Q }\nwhere \u22a4Q , \u22a5Q are new elements not occurring in P1 nor P2 . The ordering of Q\nis defined as follows: \u22a4Q and \u22a5Q are the largest and the smallest element of Q,\nrespectively, and for (i, x), (j, y) \u2208 P1\u2020 \u222a* P2\u2020 , we have (i, x) \u2264 (j, y) if and only if\ni = j and x \u2264 y in Pi . The labeling d of Q is defined by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nif x = \u22a4Q ,\n\uf8f2a\nd(x) = b\nif x = \u22a5Q ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nci (y) if x = (i, y) \u2208 P1\u2020 \u222a* P2\u2020 .\n\nThus, we can think of (P1 , c1 ) \u228e (P2 , c2 ) being obtained from the disjoint union\n* 2 , c2 ) by gluing together the top and bottom elements of the connected\n(P1 , c1 ) \u222a(P\ncomponents.\nLemma 5.1. (P1 , c1 ) \u228e (P2 , c2 ) is the supremum of (P1 , c1 ) and (P2 , c2 ) in P\u0303kab .\nProof.

We conclude that (P1 , c1 )\u228e\n(P2 , c2 ) is the supremum of (P1 , c1 ) and (P2 , c2 ) in P\u0303kab .\n\u0003\nProposition 5.2. (P\u0303kab ; \u2297, \u228e) is a distributive lattice.\nProof. The claim that (P\u0303kab ; \u2297, \u228e) is a lattice follows from Lemma 5.1 and the\ndiscussion preceding it.\nLet (Pi , ci ) \u2208 Pkab for i = 1, 2, 3. We will verify that the distributive law\nP1 \u2297 (P2 \u228e P3 ) \u2261 (P1 \u2297 P2 ) \u228e (P1 \u2297 P3 )\nholds by showing that the k-posets on each side of the above equation are homomorphically equivalent.\nFirst, define the map h : P1 \u2297 (P2 \u228e P3 ) \u2192 (P1 \u2297 P2 ) \u228e (P1 \u2297 P3 ) by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nif X = \u22a4P1 or Y = \u22a4P2 \u228eP3 ,\n\uf8f2\u22a4\nh(X, Y ) = \u22a5\nif X = \u22a5P1 or Y = \u22a5P2 \u228eP3 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u2020\n(i = 1, 2).\n(i, (X, y)) if X \u2208 P1\u2020 , Y = (i, y), y \u2208 Pi+1\n\nIt is clear that h is label-preserving. We need to verify that h is also orderpreserving. Thus, let (X, Y ) < (X \u2032 , Y \u2032 ) in P1 \u2297(P2 \u228eP3 ). If X = \u22a5P1 or Y = \u22a5P2 \u228eP3\nor X \u2032 = \u22a4P1 or Y \u2032 = \u22a4P2 \u228eP3 , then it is clear that h(X, Y ) \u2264 h(X \u2032 , Y \u2032 ). Otherwise\nX, X \u2032 \u2208 P1\u2020 , Y, Y \u2032 \u2208 (P2 \u228e P3 )\u2020 and so X \u2264 X \u2032 in P1 and Y \u2264 Y \u2032 in P2 \u228e P3 . The\nlatter condition implies that Y = (i, y), Y \u2032 = (i, y \u2032 ) for some i \u2208 {1, 2}, y, y \u2032 \u2208 Pi+1\nand y \u2264 y \u2032 in Pi+1 . Thus,\nh(X, Y ) = (i, (X, y)) \u2264 (i, (X \u2032 , y \u2032 )) = h(X \u2032 , Y \u2032 ) in (P1 \u2297 P2 ) \u228e (P1 \u2297 P3 ).\nNext, we define the map g :\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2(\u22a4P1 , \u22a4P2 \u228eP3 )\ng(X) = (\u22a5P1 , \u22a5P2 \u228eP3 )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n(x, (i, y))\n\n(P1 \u2297 P2 ) \u228e (P1 \u2297 P3 ) \u2192 P1 \u2297 (P2 \u228e P3 ) by\nif X = \u22a4,\nif X = \u22a5,\n\u0001\u2020\nif X = (i, (x, y)) \u2208 (P1 \u2297 P2 ) \u228e (P1 \u2297 P3 ) .\n\nIt is clear that g is label-preserving. We need to verify that g is also order-preserving.\nThus, let X < X \u2032 in (P1 \u2297 P2 ) \u228e (P1 \u2297 P3 ). If X = \u22a5 or Y = \u22a4, then it is clear that\n\u0001\u2020\ng(X) \u2264 g(X \u2032 ). Otherwise X, X \u2032 \u2208 (P1 \u2297 P2 ) \u228e (P1 \u2297 P3 ) and so X = (i, (x, y)),\nX \u2032 = (i, (x\u2032 , y \u2032 )) for some i \u2208 {1, 2} and x, x\u2032 \u2208 P1 , y, y \u2032 \u2208 Pi+1 and x \u2264 x\u2032 in P1\nand y \u2264 y \u2032 in Pi+1 . Thus\nh(X) = (x, (i, y)) \u2264 (x\u2032 , (i, y \u2032 )) = h(X \u2032 ) in P1 \u2297 (P2 \u228e P3 ).\nSince both h and g are homomorphisms, we conclude that the claimed homomorphical equivalence holds.\n\u0003\nTheorem 5.3. The posets P\u0303kab and L\u0303ab\nk are universal for every k \u2265 3, a, b \u2208\n{0, . . . , k \u2212 1}.\nProof. The proof is a simple adaptation of the proof of the universality of L\u0303k\npresented in [17, Theorem 4.6]. The k-posets E(A) used in the representation of an\narbitrary countable poset are 3-lattices. We just need to adjoin new top and bottom\nelements \u22a4 and \u22a5 with labels c(\u22a4) = a and c(\u22a5) = b. The resulting k-posets E \u2032 (A)\n\u2032\nare members of L\u0303ab\nk , and it is clear that there exists a homomorphism from E (A)\n\u2032\nto E (B) if and only if there exists a homomorphism from E(A) to E(B). The claim\nthus follows.\n\u0003\n\n\fON THE HOMOMORPHISM ORDER OF LABELED POSETS\n\n13\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was initiated while the first author was visiting Tampere University of\nTechnology, and some parts of it were carried out while both authors were visiting\nthe Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec en Outaouais and while the first author was visiting the\nUniversity of Luxembourg.
