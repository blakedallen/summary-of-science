Our aim is to determine empirical\ncorrelations in price fluctuations of daily sampled price data of distinct shares in a reliable\nway. Our investigation is based on 10 years of daily data for 250-350 traded shares listed\non the JSE Main Board from January 1993 to Dec 2002.\nEmail addresses: diane@maths.uct.ac.za (Diane Wilcox), tim.gebbie@physics.org (Tim\nGebbie).\n1 Corresponding author.\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n12 November 2018\n\n\fThere are several aspects to the question of how to calculate correlations in financial time\nseries. In particular, missing data and thin trading (no prices changes for a stock over\nseveral time periods) may be significant. Random correlations in price changes are likely\nto arise in an ensemble of several shares. Furthermore, for a portfolio of N distinct assets,\nthere will be N(N \u2212 1)/2 entries in a correlation matrix which has been determined from\ntime series of length L. When L is not large, the calculated covariance matrix may be\ndominated by measurement noise. Hence, it is necessary to understand effects of (i) noise\n(ii) finiteness of time series (iii) missing data and (iv) thin trading in determination of\nempirical correlation.\nThe properties of random matrices first became known with Wigner's seminal work in the\n1950's for application in nuclear physics in the study of statistical behaviour of neutron\nresonances and other complex systems of interactions ([23], [5] and [14]). More recently\nrandom matrix theory has been applied to calibrate and reduce the effects of noise in\nfinancial time series and to investigate constraints on rational (empirically based) decision making (cf. [13], [17], [15], [28], [8] [26], [10], [9] ). Correlation matrices are computed\nfor the data under investigation and quantities associated with these matrices may be\ncompared to those of random matrices. The extent to which properties of the correlation\nmatrices deviate from random matrix predications clarifies the status of the information\nderived from the computation of covariances. In several studies of shares traded in the\nS&P 500 and DAX, it was found that, aside from a small number of leading eigenvalues, the eigenvalue spectra for the measured data coincide with theoretic random matrix\npredictions, i.e. it was found that the estimation of covariances is dominated by random\nnoise. In [24], postulated a model for the correlations which explained the observed spectral properties. RMT has also been shown to yield an improved estimation technique: an\nestimated correlation matrix can be filtered by removing the contributions of eigenvalues\nwhich lie in the RMT range. In [25] it is shown that noise levels in the correlation matrix\ndepend on the ratio N : L, where N denotes the number of stocks and L denotes the\nlength of the time-series.\n\n1.1 Correlation matrices and missing data in an emerging market\n\nIn this paper we consider the problems of missing data and thin trading in determination\nof empirical correlation in daily sampled price fluctuations. We analyze the data base\ncontaining prices Si (t), the prices of assets i = 1, . . . , N at time t as follows. We first find\nthe change in asset prices\n\nri (t) = ln Si (t + \u25b3t) \u2212 ln Si (t).\nThe usual cross-correlation matrix for idealized data (non-zero price fluctuations and no\nmissing data) is given by\n\n2\n\n\fhri rj i \u2212 hri ihri i\n,\n\u03c3i \u03c3j\n\nCij :=\n\nwhereh. . .i denotes average over period studied and \u03c3i2 := hri2 i \u2212 hri i2 is the variance of\nthe price changes of asset i. Alternatively one could write\n\nCij =\n\nL\n1X\nRi (t)Rj (t)\nL t=1\n\nwhere L denotes the uniform length of the time series and Ri (t) denotes the price change\nof asset i at time t such that the average values of the Ri\u2032 s have been subtracted off and\nthe Ri\u2032 s are rescaled so that they all have constant volatility \u03c3i2 := hRi2 i = 1. This is\nwritten as C = L1 MMT where M is a N \u00d7 L matrix and MT is its transpose (cf. [17]).\nThe pairwise measured-data cross-correlation matrix using the pairwise deletion method\n[33], [34]) for the case when there is missing data in time series of returns is computed as\nfollows:\n\nCij :=\n\nh\u03c1i \u03c1j i \u2212 h\u03c1i ih\u03c1i i\n,\n\u03c3i \u03c3j\n\nwhere \u03c1i and \u03c1j denote subseries of ri and rj such that there exists measured data for\nboth \u03c1i and \u03c1j at every time period in the subseries, and h. . .i denotes average over period\nstudied, \u03c3i2 := h\u03c12i i \u2212 h\u03c1i i2 is the variance of the price changes of asset i.\n2\n\nRandom Matrix Theory (RMT) predictions\n\nWe summarise four known universal properties of random matrices, namely the Wishart\ndistribution for eigenvalues, the Wigner surmise for eigenvalue spacing, the distribution\nof eigenvector components and the inverse participation ratio for eigenvector components,\nwhich will be applied in our analysis.\nLet A denote an N \u00d7L matrix whose entries are i.i.d random variables which are normally\ndistributed with zero mean and unit variance. As N, L \u2192 \u221e and while Q = L/N is\nkept fixed, the probability density function for the eigenvalues of the Wishart matrix (or\nLaguerre ensemble) R = L1 AAT is given by ([1], [11], [31]):\n\np(\u03bb) =\n\nQ\n2\u03c0\n\nq\n\n(\u03bbmax \u2212 \u03bb)(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbmin )\n\n(1)\n\n\u03bb\n\nfor \u03bb such that \u03bbmin \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 \u03bbmax , where \u03bbmin and \u03bbmax satisfy\n3\n\n\f\u03bbmax / min = 1 +\n\nq\n1\n\u00b1 2 1/Q.\nQ\n\n(2)\n\nThe distribution of eigenvalue spacings was introduced as a further test for the case\nwhen the empirical eigenvalue distribution does not deviate significantly from the RMT\npredication. The so-called Wigner surmise for eigenvalue spacings [23] is given by\n\np(s) =\n\ns\ns\u03c0 2\nexp (\u2212\n),\n2\u03c0\n4\n\n(3)\n\nwhere s = (\u03bbi+1 \u2212 \u03bbi )/d and d denotes the average of the differences \u03bbi+1 \u2212 \u03bbi as i varies\n.\n\n2\n\nIt has been found that the eigenvector components vai for a = 1 . . . n of an eigenvector va\nare normally distributed with zero mean and unit variance [14], [4],\nu2\n1\n\u221a\nexp (\u2212 ).\np(u) =\n2\n2\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\nThe inverse participation ratio (IPR) is used to analyze the structure of the eigenvectors\nof the correlation matrix [28]. The ith component vai of va corresponds to the contribution\nof the ith time series to that eigenvector. To quantify this contribution, the IPR for va is\ndefined\n\nIa =\n\nN\nX\n\n(vai )4 ,\n\n(5)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere N is the number of time series (the number of shares) and, hence, number of\neigenvalue components. If the components of the eigenvector are identical, vai = \u221a1N , then\nIa = 1/N; if there is only a single non-zero component, then Ia = 1. In general, the IPR is\na reciprocal of the number of eigenvector components which are contribute significantly,\ni.e. which are different from zero. It is found that E[Ia ] = 3/N since the kurtosis for the\ndistribution of eigenvector components is 3.\n\n3\n\nAnalysis of Johannesburg Stock Exchange data\n\nThe JSE is one of the 20 largest national stock markets in the world. We summarise\nsome of its known qualitative features. Although many of the main board JSE shares\nare illiquid, the market as a whole is a fairly liquid one. There is share concentration in\nhalf-dozen shares: these dominant shares account for almost a third of the index and have\n2\n\nUnfolded eigenvalues are used in practice [5], [14] [28].\n\n4\n\n\fa large bias towards resources. The resources sector in turn is strongly correlated with\nthe dollar-rand exchange rate, an exogenous factor that has a dominant influence on price\ndynamics in South African stock markets. Next it is noteworthy that different shares are\nlisted on the JSE at different times and, hence, different shares do not always trade on the\nsame day. However, some shares which do not trade often may occasionally trade in large\nvolumes for several days. These realities exacerbate the problem of estimating correlations\nin a reliable way.\nThe data set used in this study incorporated a zero-order hold for prices when there was no\ntrading. This approach accounts for sequences of zero-valued returns in the return timesseries even though no measurements occurred. While it has often been convenient to set the\nreturns to zero in the periods preceding listing of shares to avoid data holes, in general, this\nstrategy seems to give rise to a significant gaussian component to estimated correlations.\nWe investigate the effect of various treatments and interpretations of measurements in\nthe context of price time-series. The approach here favours the notions that (1) if no\nprice was discovered for a given share then there was no measurement, and (2) share\ncross-correlations can only be computed when there are measurements on the same day.\n\n3.1 Filtering and partitioning the data\n\nThe data set of 10 years of data from 1 January 1993 to 31 December 2002 was split\ninto annual epochs. The data was windowed to create 6 sets of 5 years of daily price\ndata. Each block was screened to remove shares that were de-listed or which traded quite\ninfrequently. For each year in a given epoch of 5 years, this was achieved by dropping all\nshares that neither recorded price measurements at year-end nor traded at least once in\nthe preceding month. Table 1 gives the data sets used.\nIn Figure 1 we reconstruct price indices (not total price) from the market capitalization\nof each individual stock based on the economic sector membership, i.e. a weight in a\nparticular index would be the stocks market capitalization divided by the total portfolio\nmarket capitalization. The reason for this is that there is no complete constituent history\navailable over for the full 10 year period studied - the indices were reconstructed by the\nauthors.

Case 2: we compute the pairwise\nmeasured-data correlation matrix to overcome missing measurements. Case 3: we address\nthe problem of no trading, i.e. zero price fluctuations for several time periods in succession.\nTo do so, in the event of 2 or more successive zero-valued price fluctuations we delete the\nmeasured return value ri (t) = 0, effectively turning the zero-valued information into\nmissing data. This compensates for interpolated prices being mistaken for measurements.\nWe then compute the pairwise measured-data correlation matrix.\nWe considered the problem of non-positive definiteness (this property is destroyed by\nmost missing-data methods, including the one which we implement) by applying the\narea-minimizing algorithm of [7] to make the matrices in Case 3 positive semi-definite\n(see also [19]). Lastly, as a further case, we removed bias from the data as a means of\nremoving the market mode (cf. [28]). Details for these cases are not included since they\ndo not add to our discussion on the phenomenology on missing data in this paper.\nWe note that there are several other methods for treating missing data (see for example\n[33] and [34]). Our view is that the pairwise deletion method offers a sufficiently robust\ncorrelation estimate for the purposes of this analysis of daily data. Listwise deletion of an\nentire day's records for a day on which there is missing data for a single stock is likely\nto delete useful data for remaining stocks and results in too few remaining records. Mean\nsubstitution and imputation by regression are likely to introduce spurious correlations\nbetween stocks which are not listed or which do not trade for several successive periods this is borne out by the comparison of results between Cases 2 and 3.

The three graphs\nare, from left to right are: Case 1, which includes zero-padding and zero-order hold, Case 2\nwhich has only zero-order hold, and Case 3 which has measured data only.

See also Table 1.\n\nof hot deck imputation it is not at all clear which strings of return data it would be\nappropriate to draw from over the varying time windows. The most promising alternative\nmissing data method would be the use of an expectation maximization algorithm and this\nis left for further investigation.\nThe different treatments of the data have significant impact on the relationship between\nthe number of meaningful data points and the normalisation factors used in the computations.\nFigure 2 illustrates the occurrence of missing data. In Case 1, zero padding fills all the\ngaps so there appears to to be no missing data. In Case 2, there is missing data for shares\nwhich were not listed at the start of the epoch and constant prices are recorded when no\ntrading has taken place. In case 3, we remove prices when no trading has occurred. Stocks\nare ordered by market capitalization from left to right. The concentration of red on the\nright of the (c) is clear evidence that smallest cap stocks tend to trade quite infrequently.\nHorizontal bands indicate public holidays. That zero order hold was used to interpolate\nmissing data on public holidays within the data set obtained, is a prime example of how\nmeasurement error can contaminate a database.\nFigure 3 plots the frequency of the normalisation factors used to compute entries in the\ncorrelation matrices. For cases 2 and 3, incorrect normalisation factors for (truncated)\npairwise matched timeseries would have the effect of distorting correlation estimates when\nthere is missing data. In Case 1, the normalisation factor is the same for all pairs, i.e. it is\nequal to L \u2248 1305 , the total number of official trading days in the 5-yr epoch (see table).\nIn Case 2, the normalisation factor is often much larger than the number of days for which\nshares are actually traded. Here, normalisations in the order of L were frequently used\n\n7\n\n\fTable 1\nThe data sets used comprising shares traded on the Johannesburg Stock exchange.

Adjusting for the total variance \u03c32\nof the price fluctuations, it was found that 94% of the spectrum could be attributed\nto random noise. In [27], the high-frequency TAQ database published by NYSE for the\nperiod 1994-1995 was analysed: using 30 min returns for N=1000 companies with L=6448,\nit was found again that the leading eigenvalue was \u224825 times larger than the RMT\npredicted value for \u03bbmax = 1.94 and that \u224898% of the eigenvalues could be accounted for\nas random noise effects. Results of [27] were corroborated in the more extensive study [28]\nof the same high-frequency TAQ data together with CRSP databases of daily data for\ncommon stocks in the NYSE beginning 1925, the AMEX beginning 1962 and the NASDAQ\nbeginning 1972.

Daily price returns for JSE main board shares for years 1998-2002 are used to investigate\neigenvalue structures of three estimated correlation matrices. Figure 4 (a) shows the eigenvalue\ndensity functions with the distinct eigenvalues greater than the maximum RMT predicted value\nfor the same Q-factor as the sample. Insets: plots of the Wishart distribution (Eqn. 1) are\nsuperimposed on plots of the small eigenvalues. Figure 4 (b) shows the nearest-neighbour\ndistributions of the folded eigenvalues. Superimposed on these are plots of the Wigner Surmise\n( Eqn. 3). The folded eigenvalues were computed using Gaussian broadening and numerical\nintegration.\n\npredictions, (b) the distribution of eigenvector components conformed with the predicted\nGaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance and (c) almost all the eigenvector\ncomponents contributed equally to the inverse participation ratio except for eigenvectors\ncorresponding to eigenvalues outside the RMT bounds. In the latter cases it was found\nthat almost all stocks participated in the largest eigenvector while for the remaining large\neigenvectors there was localization, i.e. only a few stocks contributed to them. Similar\n\n9\n\n\fanalysis was conducted on high-frequency data for the DAX for the period Nov 1997 to\nDec 1998 to examine intraday dynamics and memory effects in the index [9].\nIn this section we investigate the same properties in the context of an emerging market.\nFigure 4 gives a comparison of the eigenvalue densities and nearest-neighbour spacings for\nthe three different cases considered for the last epoch, 1998-2002. It is clear from the graph\nthat most of the eigenvalues for Case 1 are within the range of the Wishart distribution\n(Eqn. 1). For Case 2, the number of eigenvalues within the noise range is slightly reduced.\nSome of the eigenvalues are negative in this case. For Case 3 there is a more significant\ndrop in number of eigenvalues in the noise band compared to Case 1; there are also more\nnegative eigenvalues in Case 3 compared to Case 2. In all Cases the nearest-neighbour\nspacings indicate some agreement with the Wigner surmise (Eqn. 3).\nIt is clear from the presence of negative eigenvalues in Cases 2 and 3 that the matrices\nobtained are no longer positive definite. There are several algorithms to obtain positive\ndefinite matrices from a non-positive definite estimate [7], [19]. A thorough comparison of\nthese methods (including their impact on eigenvalue distributions and temporal stability)\nis a separate topic of investigation.\nFor Case 3 we found that \u224888% of the eigenvalues (including negative values) fell below \u03bbmax = 2.23 (a smaller percentage than in [17], [27] and [28]) and that the largest\neigenvalue, \u03bb = 21.20, was \u22489.5 times great than \u03bbmax (significantly less than results\nfor developed markets [17], [27] and [28]). The high percentage of eigenvalues below \u03bbmin\nmay be attributed to the fact that many of the less liquid stocks behave independently\nrelative to the rest of the market. While a null-hypothesis of Gaussian returns is useful\nfor identifying how zero-padding and zero-order hold add noise to data, it is possible that\nthe noise range [\u03bbmax , \u03bbmin ] is wider than suggested by equation ( 1). Simulations for\ntime-series with Gaussian returns populated appropriately with missing data yield almost\nidentical distributions of eigenvalues as the Wishart distribution. Different stocks in the\nSA market exhibit a range of return phenomenologies, including periodic and aperiodic\nbehaviour [32]; hence, the construction of a representative null-hypothesis becomes problematic. From qualitative information about the market, results for inverse participation\nratios, temporal stability and style characteristics (discussed in sections below) and by an\nanalysis of the dimensionality of the SA market [29], a more realistic estimate seems to\nbe that 8-9 eigenvalues are associated with information content (\u22482% of the total).\nFigure 5 (a) gives the distributions of component values for eigenvectors corresponding\nto the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , 10th and 100th largest eigenvalues for the last epoch, 1998-2002. In\nall three cases the first three distributions deviate significantly from the Porter-Thomas\nnull-hypothesis (Eqn. 4); the distributions corresponding to smaller eigenvalues are in\ngreater agreement with their random matrix counterparts. In Case 3, the components for\nthe leading eigenvector are mostly positive valued (as in [17], [27] and [28]).\nFigure 5 (b) gives the inverse participation ratios (IPR's) plotted against corresponding\neigenvalues. In all three cases, the IPR for the leading eigenvector is approximately equal\nto the RMT prediction of 3/N (Eqn. 5), indicating contributions from almost all stocks in\n\n10\n\n\fTable 2\nAverage percentage of variance explained by the leading eigenvalues (average taken over 6\nepochs).\nCase 1\n\nCase 2\n\nCase 3\n\nTotal variance\n% explained by eigenvalues 1 \u2212 5\n\n27 % \u00b1 5 %\n\n25 % \u00b1 4 %\n\n28 % \u00b1 4 %\n\n% explained by eigenvalues 1 \u2212 15\n\n43 % \u00b1 5 %\n\n41 % \u00b1 4 %\n\n50 % \u00b1 4 %\n\n% explained by eigenvalues 1 \u2212 5\n\n11 % \u00b1 1 %\n\n12 % \u00b1 1 %\n\n15 % \u00b1 1 %\n\n% explained by eigenvalues 1 \u2212 15\n\n18 % \u00b1 2 %\n\n20 % \u00b1 2 %\n\n25 % \u00b1 2 %\n\nTrace of Correlation matrix\n\nthe market. This is consistent with findings in [28]. For Case 1, the IPR's for the 2nd and\n3rd largest and the 7 smallest eigenvalues deviate significantly from the random matrix\nnull case. For Cases 2 and 3, the IPR's for largest 6 and 9 eigenvalues, respectively,\ndeviate significantly from the random matrix null case, indicating contributions from\nonly a few stocks (as in [28]); the same is true for several of the smallest eigenvalues for\nCase 2; for Cases 2 and 3, the rest of the eigenvalues, the mean IPR is greater than the\nRMT prediction of 3/N and IPR values fluctuate with greater variance about this mean\ncompared with variance for the null case.\n\n3.4 Temporal stability of the correlation matrices\nTemporal stabilities of the matrices were investigated for annual variation. In [28], it was\nfound that the largest four eigenvectors obtained from high-frequency data (returns at\n30-min intervals) were stable up to time-lags of 1 year, while the largest two eigenvectors\nfrom 30 years of daily data were stable for time-scales up to 20 years.\nIn this investigation, we computed overlap matrices with entries given by estimated correlations between the leading eigenvectors from the last 5\u2212yr epoch, 1998 \u2212 2002, with\ntheir analogues from the preceding epochs, 1997 \u2212 2001 to 1993 \u2212 1997, as follows: for\neach epoch, the eigenvectors corresponding to the 15 largest eigenvalues were chosen; each\neigenvector was expanded to include components for every share present in the epochs\nbeing compared and when a share was not included in one of the epochs, a value of zero\nwas assigned 3 . We let U(E) denote the N \u00d7 15 matrices whose columns are the leading\n15 eigenvectors from the E th epoch, E = 6 for 1998 \u2212 2002, E = 5 for 1997 \u2212 2001, etc.\nThe overlap matrices are hence given by O(t, \u03c4 ) = U(t)T U(t \u2212 \u03c4 ), where t denotes an\nepoch and \u03c4 denotes a lag in years.\nFigure 6 gives an indication of the temporal stability of the eigenvectors associated with\nthe largest eigenvalues for Cases 1 and 3.\n3\n\nThis takes into consideration the fact that each epoch is comprised of slightly different collections of shares\n\n11\n\n\f(a) Eigenvector components PDF\n\n0\n\n1.4\nu1\n\n1.2\n\nu3\n\nLocalization \u03a3 u4\n\nP(u)\n\nSample\nGRM\n\nu2\n\n1\nCASE 1\n\n(b) Inverse Participation Ratio\n\n10\n\nu10\n\n0.8\n\nu100\nGRM\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n0.2\n\n\u03bb \u03bb \u03bb \u03bb\n\n\u03bb\n\n100 10 3 2\n\n0\n\u22123\n\n1\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\nu\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n10\nEigenvalue \u03bb\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1.4\n\n10\n\n1.2\nLocalization \u03a3 u4\n\nP(u)\n\nCASE 2\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n0.2\n\u22123\n\n0\n\u22123\n\n10\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\nu\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03bb100 \u03bb\n\n10\n\n\u03bb\n\n3\n\n\u03bb\n\n2\n\n\u03bb1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n10\nEigenvalue \u03bb\n\n3\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1.4\n\n10\n\n1.2\n4\n\nLocalization \u03a3 u\n\nP(u)\n\nCASE 3\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n0.2\n\u22123\n\n0\n\u22123\n\n10\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u03bb100 \u03bb10 \u03bb \u03bb\n3 2\n0\n\n10\n\n3\n\nEigenvalue \u03bb\n\nu\n\n\u03bb1\n2\n\n10\n\nFig. 5.

The graphs depict estimated correlations\nbetween the 15 leading eigenvectors from the last epoch, 1998 \u2212 2002, with their analogues from\nthe preceding epochs, 1998 \u2212 2002 (lag 0), 1997 \u2212 2001 (lag 1) to 1993 \u2212 1997 (lag 5).\n\ntions; correlations for the third eigenvalue are insignificant at delays of 1 and 2 years, then\ntend to be positive for delays of 3-5 years; correlations between eigenvectors corresponding to the next seven eigenvalues tend to be positive for lags 1 to 5 years. The negative\ncorrelations in Case 3 are consistent with the negative correlation between the financial\nand resources sectors and the switch in performance of corresponding indices following\nthe market stresses in emerging markets in the 2nd half of 1998 (cf. Figure 1). This case\noffers the greatest evidence of temporal stability. The overlap matrices are all computed\nagainst Epoch number 6, 1998-2002, where the market is also influenced by the crash of\nthe Rand in 2001 (cf. ZAR/USD exchange rate inset in Figure 1).\nThere is also evidence of stability for Case 2 - in this case the results are similar to but\nslighter weaker than those for Case 3.\n\n13\n\n\fINTERPRETATION OF EIGENVECTORS\n\n2\n\nCASE 1\n\neigenvector\n\n10\n\nCapitalization\nVolume\nDividend Yield\nEarnings\nEconomic Sector\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\nAggregate characteristic of components\n\n1\n\n2\n\nCASE 3\n\neigenvector\n\n10\n\nCapitalization\nVolume\nDividend Yield\nEarnings\nEconomic Sector\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\nAggregate characteristic of components\n\n1\n\nFig. 7. Fundamental characterizations of components of the eigenvectors for Cases 1 and 3 for\n1998-2002 are given in Figure 7 (a) and (b), respectively. Characteristic spectra are plotted in\nincreasing order: the lowest band represents the spectrum for the first eigenvector, the next spectrum corresponds to the second eigenvector, etc. Characteristics used are: market capitalization,\nvolume traded, dividend yield, earnings per share. For each fundamental characteristic, values\nwere mapped to [0,1]; negative values for components (on the left) indicate short positions.\n\n3.5 Interpretation of leading eigenvectors\n\nSeveral studies have investigated market segmentation or clustering via metrics obtained\nfrom correlation matrices ([21], [15], [16] and [3]). In [28], the authors are able to interpret\neigenvalues deviating from the RMT noiseband in a similar way. In that investigation,\nbecause it was an order of magnitude greater than the rest, the effect of the leading\neigenvalue was removed from the data by regressing each stock return times series against\nthe leading eigenmode to obtain a new correlation matrix from stock specific return components (as in the Capital Asset Pricing Model). The new leading eigenvector exhibited\nsignificant contributions from about 1/3 of the 999 stocks, all with large values for market\ncapitalization. The next 9 eigenvectors all contained stocks belonging to distinct economic\nsectors.\n\n14\n\n\fIn this investigation, the leading eigenvalue for Case 3 was found to contribute much less\nsignificantly to the overall trace compared to the rest of the large eigenvalues. Moreover, its\neigenvector components were not temporally stable, but displayed anti-correlations over\ntime as the behaviour of market participants changed through the 1997 Russian GKO\ndefault, the 1998 emerging market contagion and the 2001 crash of the SA currency.\nSince the leading eigenvectors could not be identified with distinct economic sectors, fundamental characteristics of each eigenvector were considered 4 . Eigenvector components\nwere weighted according fundamental properties and particular attention was paid to\neigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. The fundamental properties considered were: market capitalization, volume traded, dividend yield and earnings per share.\nThese variables were normalized and mapped to numbers between zero and unity. Economic sectors were interpreted in terms of spectra, ranging from resources, through industrial, non-cyclical and then cyclical shares into financial and then technology shares, as\nclassified by the JSE, from smaller values to larger values and rescaled for the fundamental\ncharacteristic graphs.\nThis representation offers a method to inspect the differences between the compositions\nof the eigenmodes corresponding to different eigenvectors.\nFigure 7 gives representations of the fundamental characteristics for eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues ranging from largest (bottom) to smallest (top of range). We\ninclude results for Cases 1 and 3.\nThis analysis, together with the tests of temporal stability, suggests that the eigenmodes 5\nare not easily interpreted in terms of isolated characteristics. Instead eigenmodes may be\nviewed as being representative of distinct trading strategies prevalent in the market itself.\nThis conclusion is motivated by the observation that negative component values of the\neigenvectors imply shorting and the positive values imply long positions.\nIt can be deduced from Figure 7 that those eigenvectors which are associated with eigenvalues lying in the noise band seem to correspond to trading strategies which hold roughly\nequal long and short positions in mid-capitalization stocks. Case 1 and Case 3 are qualitatively the same in this sense for eigenvalues in the noise band.\nFor Case 1, the first eigenvector is long in large capitalization, large volume resource and\nindustrial shares. The next leading eigenvector carries short positions in large capitalization, large volume shares. For all the eigenvectors in this case there is indistinct economic\nsector characterisation. This gives further evidence that there is information loss with\nzero padding and zero-order hold.\nFor Case 3 of Epoch 6, the leading eigenvector has similar long positions as in Case 1.\nThe second eigenvector is quite different from the first for Case 3, as well as from its\n4\n\nFundamental is used in the 'bottom up' sense of financial analysis, i.e. in terms of unique\ncharacteristics of stocks such as earnings, dividends, market capitalization, book value, etc...\n5 The eigenmode for each eigenvector is the timeseries derived from the timeseries of the eigenvector components. Leading eigenmodes are also sometimes referred to as principal components.\n\n15\n\n\fSPECTRA OF THE LARGEST EIGENVECTOR FOR 6 EPOCHS\nCapitalization\nVolumn\nDividend\nEarnings\nEconomic Sector\n\nEpcoh #6\n\nEpoch #5\n\nepoch\n\nCASE 3\n\nEpoch #4\n\nEpoch #3\n\nEpoch #2\n\nEpoch #1\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.8\n\n\u22120.6\n\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.2\n0\n0.2\nAggregate characteristic components (\u2212u +u)\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFig. 8. Fundamental characteristics of components of the 1st eigenvectors for the 6 epochs for\nCase 3, where Epochs 1 to 6 demarcate time windows 1993-1997 to 1998-2002 (cf. Figure 1).\n\ncounterpart in Case 1: t exhibits long positions in stocks with smaller capitalization and\nshort positions in stocks with relatively larger capitalization; it is long in stocks with low\nearnings, low volume and low dividend yield. In general the leading eigenvectors in Case\n3 have more varied compositions.\nSmall eigenvalues for Case 3 correspond to trading strategies which replicate long and\nshort positions in small capitalization, low earnings and lower volume and dividend yield\nrelative to the noise band. Cases 1 and 3 deviate markedly in this regard.\nSimilarly, inspection of the graph shows that characteristics for the rest of the eigenvectors\nare different in Cases 1 and 3. In the former, the characteristics seems to settle to a noisy\ncomposition sooner. This is consistent with findings for the inverse participation ratios.\nIn Figure 8 we compare the fundamental characteristics for the leading eigenmode for the\ndifferent epochs. In Epoch 1, the 1st eigenmode is long in comparatively higher earnings,\nsmaller capitalization and low volume stocks, while it is short lower earnings and large\ncapitalization stocks. In contrast, in Epoch 5 (1997-2001) and Epoch 6 (1998-2002), the\n1st eigenmodes are dominated by long positions in large capitalization stocks and short\npositions in small capitalization financial stocks, where the financial sector corresponds to\na economic sector value of 0.8. This depiction of a shift in the market is consistent with\nthe historical context observed in Figure 1.\nIn Figure 8 the short positions in Epoch 5 and 6 offer the only occurrences where aggregate quantification of sector participation correlates uniquely with one sector. In general,\nthere is always significant share concentration in the resources sector (sector value 0.0) for\nthe period of investigation as well as varying activity in industrial (sector value 0.6) and\nfinancial stocks. As a result, eigenmodes are not differentiated by sector participation and\n\n16\n\n\fin particular, the single aggregate quantifier for sector participation of eigenmodes considered in this investigation is generally ineffective. This is not surprising in an emerging\nmarket, where stock concentration, currency volatility and generally high co-movement\nwith commodity prices blur economic sector independence. Inspection of these quantifiers\nfor the second eigenmodes corroborates these findings.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nOur investigation exposes some notable differences in the spectral properties of the correlation matrices computed by the three different methods outlined. As in preceding analyses\nof financial market data, in all cases we have found that the distribution of eigenvalues\nexhibits: (1) a significant part of the spectrum falls within the range of random matrix\npredictions, and (2) there exists a small no. of large leading eigenvalues. However, we\nfound that by computing measured-data correlation matrices, Case 3, a far less substantial part of the spectrum falls within the Wishart range (Eqn. 1) than when computing\ncorrelations with zero padding, Case 1. Similar results were found when comparing the\ninverse participation ratios of Cases 1 and 3 with their RMT counterparts. Results for\nCase 2, which incorporated zero-order hold but not zero padding, varied with the RMT\ntests; here the eigenvector components and inverse participation ratios were closest to\nRMT predictions.\nOur investigation suggests that zero padding and zero-order hold increases the level of\nnoise in the estimation of correlation matrices. The correlations between leading eigenvectors from successive epochs also showed evidence of greater temporal stability when\nmeasured-data correlations were used.\nOur fundamental characteristic investigation suggests that the leading eigenmodes may\nbe interpreted in terms of independent trading strategies with long range correlations.\nThese are more distinct for the measured-data correlation case than when there was zero\npadding and zero-order hold.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank the referees of Physica A for their pertinent comments and questions.
