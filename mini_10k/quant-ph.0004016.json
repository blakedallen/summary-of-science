Bose and V. Vedral\nCentre for Quantum Computation, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PU, England\nWe consider the apparatus in a quantum measurement process to be in a mixed state. We\npropose a simple upper bound on the probability of correctly distinguishing any number of mixed\nstates. We use this to derive fundamental bounds on the efficiency of a measurement in terms of\nthe temperature of the apparatus.\n\narXiv:quant-ph/0004016v1 4 Apr 2000\n\nPacs No: 03.65.Bz, 03.67.-a\n\nThe quantum measurement process was first analysed\nfrom the fully quantum perspective by von Neumann\n[1]. In the description of a typical quantum measurement, the initial states of the system and the apparatus (both treated quantum mechanically) are taken to\nbe pure states. The measurement process is a transformation of the type\nZ\nZ\n\u03c6(x)|xis dx \u2297\n\u03b7(y)|yia dy\nZ Z\n\u2192\n\u03c6(x)\u03b7(y + f (x))|xis \u2297 |yia dxdy (1)\n\nR\nR\nwhere \u03c6(x)|xis dx and \u03b7(y)|yia dy are initial states\nof the system and the measuring apparatus respectively.\nNote that after the measurement, the state of the apparatus is correlated to the state of the system. This enables\nus to infer the state of the system by observing the state\nof the apparatus. In general, one is allowed to perform\nany positive operator valued measurement (POVM) on\nthe apparatus state to infer the system state (not analysed by von Neumann). This becomes important in a\nrealistic quantum measurement, in which the apparatus\nis a macroscopic system and likely to be in a mixed (generally thermal) state throughout the measurement. This\nwill make measurements more difficult in general than\nthe pure apparatus case as mixed states are generically\nharder to distinguish. One could, of course, attempt to\nestimate the efficiency of state inference on the basis of\nspecific von Neumann projections on the apparatus state.\nThis, however, is usually less efficient than a more general POVM. Strangely, to the best of our knowledge, all\ntreatments of quantum measurement seem to neglect this\nfact and assume the initial apparatus state to be pure.\nIn this letter, we analyse the quantum measurement process with a mixed apparatus. Our formalism allows us to\nestimate the probability of success in state determination\nwith a mixed apparatus. We use this to put bounds on\nthe probability os successful state inference in terms of\nthe temperature of an apparatus in a thermal state.\nWe start with a simple example of a two level system\nbeing measured by a harmonic oscillator apparatus initially in a thermal state. The measurement interaction\nis described by\n|0is \u2297 |nia \u2192 |0is \u2297 |nia\n|1is \u2297 |nia \u2192 |1is \u2297 |n + 1ia ,\n\nwhere |0is , |1is are two orthogonal states of the two level\nsystem that the apparatus is designed to detect and |nia\ndenotes a Fock state of the apparatus. Note that we could\nhave chosen any other measurement interaction, but that\nwould lead to similar results. In particular, this measurement interaction works perfectly when the apparatus is\ninitially in a pure Fock state. If the apparatus starts off\nP\u221e \u2212\u03b2n\nin the initial thermal state \u03c1(\u03b2)a = n=0 e Z (|nihn|)a\nP\u221e \u2212\u03b2n\n(here Z is the partition function\nand \u03b2 =\nn=0 e\nh\u0304\u03c9/kB T where \u03c9 is the frequency of the oscillator, T its\ntemperature and kB is Boltzmann's constant), then the\nmeasurement leads to\n\n(|0ih0|)s \u2297 \u03c1(\u03b2)a \u2192 (|0ih0|)s \u2297 \u03c1(\u03b2)a\n\u221e\nX\ne\u2212\u03b2(n\u22121)\n(|nihn|)a . (3)\n(|1ih1|)s \u2297 \u03c1(\u03b2)a \u2192 (|1ih1|)s \u2297\nZ\nn=1\n\nThe maximum probability Pc of correctly distinguishing\nbetween any two mixed states \u03c10 and \u03c11 by any POVM\nis given by Helstrom's formula [2]\n\nPc (\u03c10 , \u03c11 ) =\n\n1 1\n+ Tr|\u03c10 \u2212 \u03c11 |.\n2 4\n\n(4)\n\nP\ne\u2212\u03b2(n\u22121)\nIn our case \u03c10 = \u03c1(\u03b2)a and \u03c11 = \u221e\n(|nihn|)a .\nn=1\nZ\nWe thus obtain the probability of correctly identifying\nthe state of the apparatus (and hence the system, which\nis our main goal) to be\n\nPc =\n\n(2)\n1\n\ne\u03b2 \u2212 1\n1 1 1\n+ { +\n(Z \u2212 1)}.\n2 4 Z\nZ\n\n(5)\n\n\fis the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution\nof the density matrices. The rationale behind this formula becomes clear when one considers a sequence of n\npreparations of the system state and measurements on\nthe corresponding apparatus states. The probability of\ncorrectly inferring a certain sequence of n states {\u03c1i } is\nbounded above by the ratio of the number of correctly\nidentified sequences and the total number of possible sequences. From the statistical interpretation of the quantum relative entropy [4], we get the numerator of this\nratio to be enH and the denominator is enh(p0 ,p1 ,...,pN )\n(this is equivalent to the law of large numbers).

This means that at low temperatures\nwe can correctly distinguish between |0is and |1is and\nthis is because then the initial state of the apparatus is\nvirtually pure. On the other hand for high temperatures,\nthe initial state of the apparatus is virtually maximally\nmixed and does not change due to the measurement interaction (i.e \u03c10 = \u03c11 ). We see that for achieving Pc\ngreater than 0.8, we require\nkB\n\u03c9\n\u2265\n.\nT\nh\u0304\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\u22122\n\n\u22121.5\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFIG. 2. The figure shows the variation of the upper bound\non the probability of correct state inference of a N + 1 level\nsystem being measured by a harmonic oscillator apparatus\nwith log \u03b2, where \u03b2 = h\u0304\u03c9/kB T and the logarithm is in base\n10. For plot(a) N = 1, for plot(b) N = 3, for plot(c) N = 7.\nHere Pc is obtained from our formula Eq.(7).\n\nWe again take a harmonic oscillator apparatus, but\nnow a N + 1 level system with orthogonal states\n|0is , |1is , ..., |N is which interacts with the apparatus as\n|iis \u2297 |nia \u2192 |iis \u2297 |n + iia .\n\n(10)\n\nThe initial state of the apparatus is again a thermal state.\nCorresponding to each system state |iis , the apparatus\nwill evolve to a different state \u03c1ia . These are given by\n\nPc (\u03c10 , \u03c11 , ..., \u03c1N ; p0 , p1 , ..., pN ) = eH\u2212h(p0 ,p1 ,...,pN ) , (7)\n\ni\n\n(c)\n\nLog(\u03b2)\n\n(6)\n\nX\nX\npi S(\u03c1i ),\np i \u03c1i ) \u2212\nH = S(\n\n(b)\n\n0.3\n\nThis can be seen as a fundamental limit on obtaining one\nbit of information reliably.\nThe quantum system being measured, may, however,\nbe a system with more than two orthogonal states. In\nthat case we have to have a formula for the probability\nof correctly identifying any one of several mixed states\n\u03c10 , \u03c11 , ..., \u03c1N . There is no existing general formula extending the Helstrom's formula to an arbitrary number of\ndensity matrices. Here we propose a generalisation which\ngives a bound on the probability of correct identification\nof one of \u03c10 , \u03c11 , ..., \u03c1N which appear with probabilities\np0 , p1 , ..., pN . This bound is\n\nwhere\n\n(a)\n\nPC\n\n\u03c1ia =\n\n(8)\n\n\u221e\nX\ne\u2212\u03b2(n\u2212i)\nn=i\n\ni\n\nZ\n\n(|nihn|)a .\n\n(11)\n\nThe entropy of all these states is the same and equal to\n\nis the Holevo bound [3], S(\u03c1) = \u2212Tr\u03c1 ln \u03c1 and where\nX\npi ln pi ,\n(9)\nh(p0 , p1 , ..., pN ) = \u2212\n\nS(\u03c1ia ) =\n\ni\n\n2\n\nhEi\n+ ln Z,\nkB T\n\n(12)\n\n\fP\nwhere hEi = (h\u0304\u03c9/Z) ne\u2212\u03b2n is the average energy of\nthe apparatus.\nP\nThe entropy of the total state \u03c1 = i \u03c1ia is given by\nS(\u03c1) = \u2212\n\ni\nN X\nX\n(\ni=0 j=0\n\n\u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\n\ni\nX\ne\u2212\u03b2j\ne\u2212\u03b2j\n) ln (\n)\nZ(N + 1)\nZ(N + 1)\nj=0\n\ni\nX\n\ni=N +1 j=i\u2212N\n\ni\nX\ne\u2212\u03b2j\ne\u2212\u03b2j\n) ln (\n) (13)\nZ(N + 1)\nZ(N + 1)\nj=i\u2212N\n\nThe entropies S(\u03c1) and S(\u03c1ia ) are used to compute Pc\nfrom Eq.(7). This is plotted in Fig. 2 for three different\ndimensionalities of the measured system (N +1 = 2, 4, 8).\nNote that all the three plots in Fig.2 have the same shape\nand, as expected, tend to N1+1 for small \u03b2 (high temperature limit) and to unity for large \u03b2 (low temperature\nlimit). Note also that in the latter case (when \u03b2 > 1) the\nprobability bound Pc is well approximated by the simple\nexpression\nPc \u223c\n\nwhen different Fock states inside a cavity are inferred\nby different dispacements of a mirror in a coherent state\n[5]). In quantum optics, in particular, preparation of\nnonclassical states via conditional measurements on an\napparatus is very popular [6]. Our formula for Pc will\nbe an upper bound to the fidelity of such preparations.\nWe hope that this kind of analysis also stimulates more\nresearch in the area of quantum computation with mixed\nstates as explored in Ref. [7].\n\ne\n\nhEi\nBT\n\n[1] J. von Neumann, Mathematical foundations of quantum\nmechanics, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1955;\nH.

The above approximation (Eq.(14)) is already very good for \u03b2 = 5\ndiffering by about 2 percent from the exact value.\nOur bound applies to the general setting of measuring\nstates of a system by correlating them to pure nonorthogonal apparatus states. This happens when different orthogonal states of the system get correlated to different nonorthogonal states of the apparatus (for example,\n\n3\n\n\f"}
