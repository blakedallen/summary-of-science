The pluricanonical map \u03c6n of S is the map given by the linear system |nKS |, where\nKS is the canonical divisor of S. For minimal surfaces S, \u03c6n is a birational\nmorphism if n \u2265 5 (cf. [BPV, Ch.VII, Theorem (5.2)]). The bicanonical map\n2\n\n\u03c62 : S \u2212\u2192 IP KS +\u03c7(S)\u22121\nis a morphism if pg (S) \u2265 1 (this result is due to various authors, see [CC] for\nmore details). This paper focuses on the study of surfaces S with pg (S) =\nq(S) = 1 having an involution i such that the Kodaira dimension of S/i is\nnon-negative and \u03c62 is composed with i, i. e. it factors through the double\ncover p : S \u2192 S/i.\nThere is an instance where the bicanonical map is necessarily composed\nwith an involution: suppose that S has a fibration of genus 2, i. e. it has a\nmorphism f from S to a curve such that a general fibre F of f is irreducible\nof genus 2. The system |2KS | cuts out on F a subseries of the bicanonical\nseries of F, which is composed with the hyperelliptic involution of F, and\n1\n\n\fthen \u03c62 is composed with an involution. This is the so called standard case\nof non-birationality of the bicanonical map.\nBy the results of Bombieri, [Bo], improved later by Reider, [Rd], a minimal surface S satisfying K 2 > 9 and \u03c62 non-birational necessarily presents\nthe standard case of non-birationality of the bicanonical map.\nThe non-standard case of non-birationality of the bicanonical map, i. e.\nthe case where \u03c62 is non-birational and the surface has no genus 2 fibration,\nhas been studied by several authors.\nDu Val, [Du], classified the regular surfaces S of general type with pg \u2265 3,\nwhose general canonical curve is smooth and hyperelliptic. Of course that,\nfor these surfaces, the bicanonical map is composed with an involution i such\nthat S/i is rational. The families of surfaces exhibited by Du Val, presenting\nthe non-standard case, are nowadays called the Du Val examples.\nOther authors have later studied the non-standard case: the articles\n[CCM], [CFM], [CM1], [CM2], [Xi2] and [Br] treat the cases \u03c7(OS ) > 1\nor q(S) \u2265 2 (cf. the expository paper [Ci] for more information on this\nproblem).\nXiao Gang, [Xi2], presented a list of possibilities for the non-standard\ncase of non-birationality of the bicanonical morphism \u03c62 . For the case when\n\u03c62 has degree 2 and the bicanonical image is a ruled surface, Theorem 2 of\n[Xi2] extended Du Val's list to pg (S) \u2265 1 and added two extra families (this\nresult is still valid assuming only that \u03c62 is composed with an involution\nsuch that the quotient surface is a ruled surface). Recently G. Borrelli [Br]\nexcluded these two families, confirming that the only possibilities for this\ninstance are the Du Val examples.\nFor irregular surfaces the following holds (see [Xi2, Theorems 1, 3], [CCM,\nTheorem A], [CM1, Theorem 1.1], [CM2]):\nSuppose that S is a smooth minimal irregular surface of general type having non-birational bicanonical map. If pg (S) \u2265 2 and S has no genus 2\nfibration, then only the following (effective) possibilities occur:\n* pg (S) = q(S) = 2, KS2 = 4;\n* pg (S) = q(S) = 3, KS2 = 6.\nIn both cases \u03c62 is composed with an involution i such that Kod(S/i) = 2.\n\nThis paper completes this result classifying the minimal surfaces S with\npg (S) = q(S) = 1 such that \u03c62 is composed with an involution i satisfying\nKod(S/i) \u2265 0.\n2\n\n\fThe main result is the following:\nTheorem 1 Let S be a smooth minimal irregular surface of general type with\nan involution i such that Kod(S/i) \u2265 0 and the bicanonical map \u03c62 of S is\ncomposed with i. If pg (S) = q(S) = 1, then only the following possibilities\ncan occur:\na) S/i is regular, the Albanese fibration of S has genus 2 and\n(i) Kod(S/i) = 2, \u03c7(S/i) = 2, KS2 = 2, deg(\u03c62 ) = 8, or\n(ii) Kod(S/i) = 1, \u03c7(S/i) = 2, 2 \u2264 KS2 \u2264 4, deg(\u03c62 ) \u2265 4, or\n(iii) S/i is birational to a K3 surface, 3 \u2264 KS2 \u2264 6, deg(\u03c62 ) = 4;\nb) S has no genus 2 fibration and S/i is birational to a K3 surface.\nMoreover, there are examples for (i), (ii) with KS2 = 4, (iii) with KS2 = 3, 4\nor 5 and for b) with KS2 = 6 and \u03c62 of degree 2.\nRemark 2 Examples for (iii) were given by Catanese in [Ca2]. The other\nexamples will be presented in Section 5.\nNote that surfaces of general type with pg = q = 1 and K 2 = 3 or 8 were\nalso studied by Polizzi in [Po1] and [Po2].\nIn the example in Section 5 for case b) of Theorem 1, S has pg = q = 1\nand K 2 = 6. This seems to be the first construction of a surface with these\ninvariants. This example contradicts a result of Xiao Gang. More precisely,\nthe list of possibilities in [Xi2] rules out the case where S has no genus\n2 fibration, pg (S) = q(S) = 1 and S/i is birational to a K3 surface. In\nLemma 7 of [Xi2] it is written that R has only negligible singularities, but\ne < 0 in formula (3) of page 727 was overlooked.\nthe possibility \u03c7(KPe + \u03b4)\nIn fact we will see that R (B in our notation) can have a non-negligible\nsingularity.\nAn important technical tool that will be used several times is the canonical\nresolution of singularities of a surface. This is a resolution of singularities as\ndescribed in [BPV].\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 studies some general properties of a surface of general type S with an involution i. Section 3 states some\nproperties of surfaces with pg = q = 1. Section 4 contains the proof of Theorem 1. Crucial ingredients for this proof are the existence of the Albanese\nfibration of S and the formulas of Section 2. In Section 5 examples for Theorem 1 are obtained, via the construction of branch curves with appropriate\nsingularities.

We work over the complex numbers; all varieties are assumed to be projective algebraic. We do not distinguish between\nline bundles and divisors on a smooth variety. Linear equivalence is denoted\nby \u2261. A nodal curve or (\u22122)-curve C on a surface is a curve isomorphic\nto IP 1 such that C 2 = \u22122. Given a surface X, Kod(X) means the Kodaira\ndimension of X. We say that a curve singularity is negligible if it is either a\ndouble point or a triple point which resolves to at most a double point after\none blow-up. A (n, n) point, or point of type (n, n), is a point of multiplicity n\nwith an infinitely near point also of multiplicity n. An involution of a surface\nS is an automorphism of S of order 2. We say that a map is composed with\nan involution i of S if it factors through the map S \u2192 S/i. The rest of the\nnotation is standard in Algebraic Geometry.\n\n2\n\nGeneralities on involutions\n\nLet S be a smooth minimal surface of general type with an involution i. As\nS is minimal of general type, this involution is biregular. The fixed locus of\ni is the union of a smooth curve R\u2032\u2032 (possibly empty) and of t \u2265 0 isolated\npoints P1 , . . . , Pt . Let S/i be the quotient of S by i and p : S \u2192 S/i be\nthe projection onto the quotient. The surface S/i has nodes at the points\nQi := p(Pi ), i = 1, . . . , t, and is smooth elsewhere. If R\u2032\u2032 6= \u2205, the image via p\nof R\u2032\u2032 is a smooth curve B \u2032\u2032 not containing the singular points Qi , i = 1, . . . , t.\nLet now h : V \u2192 S be the blow-up of S at P1 , . . . , Pt and set R\u2032 = h\u2217 R\u2032\u2032 .\nThe involution i induces a biregular involution ei on V whose fixed locus is\nP\nR := R\u2032 + t1 h\u22121 (Pi ). The quotient W := V /ei is smooth and one has a\n4\n\n\fcommutative diagram:\nh\n\nV \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 S\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\n\u03c0y\n\ng\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6p\ny\n\nW \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 S/i\n\nwhere \u03c0 : V \u2192 W is the projection onto the quotient and g : W \u2192 S/i is\nthe minimal desingularization map. Notice that\nAi := g \u22121(Qi ), i = 1, . . . , t,\nare (\u22122)-curves and \u03c0 \u2217 (Ai ) = 2 * h\u22121 (Pi ). Set B \u2032 := g \u2217 (B \u2032\u2032 ). Because \u03c0 is a\nP\ndouble cover with branch locus B \u2032 + t1 Ai , there exists a line bundle L on\nW such that\n2L \u2261 B := B \u2032 +\n\nt\nX\n\nAi .\n\n1\n\nIt is well known that (cf.

VII, Theorem (4.1)]) and KS2 \u2265 2pg for an\nirregular surface (see [De]).\nFurthermore, if the bicanonical map of S is not birational, then KS2 6= 9.\nIn fact, by [CM1], if KS2 = 9 and \u03c62 is not birational, then S has a genus 2\nfibration, while Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 2.2 of [Xi1] implies that if S has a genus 2 fibration\nand pg (S) = q(S) = 1, then KS2 \u2264 6.\nSince q(S) = 1 the Albanese variety of S is an elliptic curve E and the\nAlbanese map is a connected fibration (see e. g. [Be] or [BPV]).\nSuppose that S has an involution i. Then i preserves the Albanese fibration (because q(S) = 1) and so we have a commutative diagram\nh\n\nV \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 S \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 E\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\n\u03c0y\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6p\ny\n\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nW \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 S/i \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u2206\n6\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhere \u2206 is a curve of genus \u2264 1. Denote by\nfA : W \u2192 \u2206\nthe fibration induced by the Albanese fibration of S.\nRecall that\n\u03c1:W \u2192P\nis the projection of W onto its minimal model P and\nB := \u03c1(B),\nwhere B := B \u2032 +\nLet\n\nPt\n\n1\n\nAi \u2282 W is the branch locus of \u03c0.\nB \u2032 := \u03c1(B \u2032 ), Ai = \u03c1(Ai ).\n\nWhen B has only negligible singularities, the map \u03c1 contracts only exceptional curves contained in fibres of fA . In fact, there exists otherwise a\n(\u22121)-curve J \u2282 W such that JB = 2 and so \u03c0 \u2217 (J) is a rational curve transverse to the fibres of the (genus 1 base) Albanese fibration of S, which is imP\npossible. Moreover, \u03c1 contracts no curve meeting Ai , because h : V \u2192 S\nis the contraction of isolated (\u22121)-curves. Therefore the singularities of B\nTP\nare exactly the singularities of B \u2032 , i. e. B \u2032\nAi = \u2205. In this case the image\nof fA on P will be denoted by fA .\nIf \u2206 \u223c\n= IP 1 , then the double cover E \u2192 \u2206 is ramified over 4 points pj of\nP\n\u2206, thus the branch locus B \u2032 + t1 Ai is contained in 4 fibres\nFAj := fA\u2217 (pj ), j = 1, ..., 4,\n\nof the fibration fA . Hence, by Zariski's Lemma (see e. g. [BPV]), the\nirreducible components Bi\u2032 of B \u2032 satisfy Bi\u20322 \u2264 0. If B has only negligible sin2\ngularities, then also B \u2032 \u2264 0. As \u03c0 \u2217 (FAj ) is of multiplicity 2, each component\nP\nof FAj which is not a component of the branch locus B \u2032 + t1 Ai must be of\neven multiplicity.\n\n4\n\nThe classification theorem\n\nIn this section we will prove Theorem 1. We will use freely the notation and\nresults of Sections 2 and 3.\nProof of Theorem 1: Since pg (P ) \u2264 pg (S) = 1, then \u03c7(OP ) \u2264 2\u2212q(P ) \u2264 2.\nProposition 4 gives \u03c7(OP ) \u2265 1, because KP is nef (i. e. KP C \u2265 0 for every\ncurve C). So from Proposition 4 and the classification of surfaces (see e. g.\n[Be] or [BPV]) only the following cases can occur:\n7\n\n\f1) P is of general type;\n2) P is a surface with Kodaira dimension 1;\n3) P is an Enriques surface, B has only negligible singularities;\n4) P is a K3 surface, B has a 4-uple or (3, 3) point, and possibly negligible\nsingularities.\nWe will show that: case 3) does not occur, in cases 1) and 2) the Albanese\nfibration has genus 2 and only in case 4) the Albanese fibration can have\ngenus 6= 2.\nEach of cases 1),..., 4) will be studied separately. We start by considering:\nCase 1) As P is of general type, KP2 \u2265 1 and KP is nef, Proposition 4\ngives \u03c7(OP ) = 2, KP2 = 1, KP \u03b4 = 0 and B has only negligible singularities.\n2\nThe equality KP B \u2032 = KP 2\u03b4 = 0 implies B \u2032 < 0 when B \u2032 6= 0. In the notation\nP\nP\nof Remark 3 one has KW \u2261 \u03c1\u2217 (KP ) + Ei and B \u2032 = \u03c1\u2217 (B \u2032 ) \u2212 2 Ei . So\n1\n1\nKS2 = KV2 + t = (2KV )2 + t = \u03c0 \u2217 (2KW + B)2 + t =\n4\n4\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n= (2KW + B)2 + t = (2KW + B \u2032 )2 = (2KP + B \u2032 )2 = (4 + B \u2032 ).\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\nSince KS2 \u2265 2pg (S) for an irregular surface (see [De]), B \u2032 < 0 is impossible,\nhence B \u2032 = 0 and KS2 = 2. By [Ca1] minimal surfaces of general type with\npg = q = 1 and K 2 = 2 have Albanese fibration of genus 2. This is case (i)\nof Theorem 1. We will see in Section 5 an example for this case.\nFinally the fact that deg(\u03c62 ) = 8 follows immediately because \u03c62 is a\nmorphism onto IP 2 and (2KS )2 = 8.\nNext we exclude:\nCase 3) Using the notation of Remark 3 of Section 2, we can write\nP\nP\nKW \u2261 \u03c1\u2217 (KP )+ Ei and 2L \u2261 \u03c1\u2217 (2\u03b4)\u22122 Ei , for some exceptional divisors\nEi . Hence\n1\nL(KW + L) = L(2KW + 2L) =\n2\nX\n1 \u2217\n1\n= (\u03c1 (\u03b4) \u2212\nEi )(2\u03c1\u2217 (KP ) + \u03c1\u2217 (2\u03b4)) = \u03b4(2KP + 2\u03b4) = \u03b4 2\n2\n2\n2\nand then, from (1), \u03b4 = \u22122. Now (4) and (5) imply t = KS2 + 4, thus\n2\n\n2\n\nB \u2032 = B + 2t = (2\u03b4)2 + 2t = \u22128 + 2t = 2KS2 > 0.\n8\n\n\f2\n\nThis is a contradiction because we have seen that B \u2032 \u2264 0 when B \u2032 has only\nnegligible singularities. Thus case 3) does not occur.\nNow we focus on:\nCase 2) Since we are assuming that Kod(P ) = 1, P has an elliptic\nfibration (i. e. a morphism fe : P \u2192 C where C is a curve and the general\nfibre of fe is a smooth connected elliptic curve). Then KP is numerically\nequivalent to a rational multiple of a fibre of fe (see e. g. [Be] or [BPV]). As\nKP \u03b4 \u2265 0, Proposition 4, together with \u03c7(OP ) \u2264 2, yield KP \u03b4 = 0 or 1.\nDenote by Fe (resp. FA ) a general fibre of fe (resp. fA ) and let FA :=\n\u03c1(FA ). If KP \u03b4 = 0, then Fe B = 0, which implies that the fibration fe lifts to\nan elliptic fibration on S. This is impossible because S is a surface of general\ntype. So KP \u03b4 = 1 and, since pg (P ) \u2264 pg (S) = 1, the only possibility allowed\nby Proposition 4 is\npg (P ) = 1, q(P ) = 0 and B has only negligible singularities.\nNow q(P ) = 0 implies that the elliptic fibration fe has a rational base,\nthus the canonical bundle formula (see e. g. [BPV, Ch. V, \u00a712]) gives\nP\nKP \u2261 (mi \u2212 1)Fi , where mi Fi are the multiple fibres of fe . From\n2 = 2\u03b4KP = B \u2032 KP = B \u2032\n\nwe get\n\nX\n\n(mi \u2212 1)Fi ,\n\nB \u2032 Fi \u2261 0 (mod 2)\n\n1\nKP \u2261 Fe .\n2\n2\n\nSince B has only negligible singularities, B \u2032 \u2264 0 and then\n\u0010\n\n2KS2 = (2KW + B \u2032 )2 = \u03c1\u2217 2KP + B \u2032\n\n\u00112\n\n2\n\n= 8 + B \u2032 \u2264 8.\n\n(7)\n\nTherefore 2 \u2264 KS2 \u2264 4. If KS2 = 2, then the Albanese fibration of S is\nof genus 2, by [Ca1]. So, to prove statement a), (ii) of Theorem 1, we must\nshow that for KS2 = 3 or 4 the Albanese fibration of S has genus 2. We will\nstudy each of these cases separately.\nFirst we consider\n* K2S = 4.\nLet FAi := \u03c1(FAi ), i = 1, . . . , 4.\n\n9\n\n\fClaim 1: If fA is not a genus 2 fibration then\nFAj = 2B \u2032 ,\nfor some j \u2208 {1, . . . , 4}.\n2\n\nProof : By formula (7) B \u2032 = 0, and so B \u2032 contains the support of x \u2265 1 of\nthe FAi 's. The facts KP FA > 0 (because g(FA ) \u2265 2) and KP B \u2032 = 2 imply\nx = 1, i. e. FAj = kB \u2032 , for some j \u2208 {1, . . . , 4} and k \u2208 IN + . If k = 1 then\nFA KP = 2, thus FA is of genus 2 and S is as in case (ii) of Theorem 1.\nSuppose now k \u2265 2. Then each irreducible component of the divisor\nD := FA1 + . . . + FA4\nP\n\nwhose support is not in 14\n1 Ai is of multiplicity greater than 1. The fibration\nfA gives a cover Fe \u2192 IP 1 of degree FA Fe , for a general fibre Fe of the elliptic\nfibration fe . The Hurwitz formula (see e. g. [GH]) says that the ramification\ndegree r of this cover is 2FA Fe . Let p1 , . . . , pn be the points in Fe \u2229D and \u03b1i be\nP\nthe intersection number of Fe and D at pi . Of course Fe D = 4FA Fe = n1 \u03b1i\nTP\nand then Fe\nAi = \u2205 implies \u03b1i \u2265 2, i = 1, . . . , n. We have\n2FA Fe = r \u2265\n\nn\nX\n\n(\u03b1i \u2212 1) =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b1i \u2212 n = 4FA Fe \u2212 n,\n\n1\n\n1\n\ni. e. n \u2265 2FA Fe . The only possibility is n = 2FA Fe and \u03b1i = 2 \u2200i, which\nmeans that every component \u0393 of D such that \u0393Fe 6= 0 is exactly of multiplicity 2. In particular an irreducible component of B \u2032 is of multiplicity 2,\nthus k = 2, i. e. FAj = 2B \u2032 . \u22c4\nClaim 2: There is a smooth rational curve C contained in a fibre FC of\nthe elliptic fibration fe , and not contained in fibres of fA , such that\nm := Cb\n\nt\nX\n\nAi \u2264 3,\n\n(8)\n\n1\n\nwhere Cb is the strict transform of C in W.\n\nProof : Since Ai Fe = Ai 2KP = 0, then each Ai is contained in a fibre of\nfe , and in particular the elliptic fibration fe has reducible fibres. Denote by\nC an irreducible component of a reducible fibre FC of fe , by \u03be the multiplicity of C in FC and by Cb the strict transform of C in W. If the intersection\n10\n\n\fnumber of C and the support of FC \u2212 \u03beC is greater than 3 then, from the\nconfigurations of singular fibres of an elliptic fibration (see e. g. [BPV, Ch.\nV, \u00a77]), FC must be of type I0\u2217 , i. e. it has the following configuration: it\nis the union of four disjoint (\u22122)-curves \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b84 with a (\u22122)-curve \u03b8, with\nmultiplicity 2, such that \u03b8\u03b8i = 1, i = 1, . . . , 4.\nP\nP\nSo if Cb t1 Ai > 3, the fibre FC containing C is of type I0\u2217 with Cb t1 Ai =\n4. Since the number of nodes of S/i is t = KS2 + 10 = 14 6\u2261 0 (mod 4),\nP\nthere must be a reducible fibre such that for every component C 6\u2282 t1 Ai ,\nP\nCb t1 Ai \u2264 3. As fe 6= fA and the Ai 's are contained in fibres of fe and in\nfibres of fA , we can choose C not contained in fibres of fA . \u22c4\nLet C be as in Claim 2 and consider the resolution Ve \u2192 V of the singub Let G \u2282 Ve be the strict transform of \u03c0 \u2217 (C).\nb Notice that G\nlarities of \u03c0 \u2217 (C).\nhas multiplicity 1, because C transverse to the fibres of fA implies C 6\u2282 B.\nRecall that E denotes the basis of the Albanese fibration of S.\nClaim 3: The Albanese fibration of Ve induces a cover G \u2192 E with ramification degree\nr := KVe G + G2 .\nProof : Let G1 , . . . , Gh be the connected (hence smooth) components of G.\nThe curve C is not contained in fibres of fA , thus G is not contained in fibres\nof the Albanese fibration of Ve . This fibration induces a cover Gi \u2192 E with\nramification degree, from the Hurwitz formula,\nri = 2g(Gi ) \u2212 2 = KVe Gi + G2i .\n\nThis way we have a cover G \u2192 E with ramification degree\nr=\n\nX\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nri = KVe (G1 + * * * + Gh ) + G21 + * * * + G2h = KVe G + G2 . \u22c4\n\nWe are finally in position to show that g(FA ) = 2.\nb \u2032 .

Suppose then g(\u039b) = 3. Surfaces S with KS2 = g(\u039b) = 3 are studied in detail\nin [CC]. There (see also [Ko]) it is shown that the relative canonical map \u03b3,\ngiven by |KS + n\u039b| for some n, is a morphism.\n2\nWe know that KP B \u2032 = 2 and B \u2032 = \u22122, by (7). We have already seen\nthat B has only negligible singularities (which means ri = 2 \u2200i, in the noP\ntation of Remark 3) and then \u03c1 contracts no curve meeting Ai . Let R\u2032 be\nthe support of \u03c0 \u2217 (B \u2032 ).\nClaim 4: We have\nKV R\u2032 = 1.\nProof :\n2KV * 2R\u2032 = \u03c0 \u2217 (2KW + B)\u03c0 \u2217 (B \u2032 ) = 2(2KW + B)B \u2032 =\n\u0010\n\n= 2(2KW + B \u2032 )B \u2032 = 2 2\u03c1\u2217 (KP ) + \u03c1\u2217 (B \u2032 )\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\n\u03c1\u2217 (B \u2032 ) \u2212\n\n= 2(2KP + B \u2032 )B \u2032 = 2(4 \u2212 2) = 4,\nthus KV R\u2032 = 1. \u22c4\nAs the map\n\u03b3 \u25e6 h : V \u2212\u2192 \u03b3(S)\n12\n\nX\n\n\u0011\n\n2Ei =\n\n\fis a birational morphism, \u03b3 \u25e6 h(R\u2032 ) is a line (plus possibly some isolated\npoints). This way there exists a smooth rational curve \u03b2 \u2282 B \u2032 such that\nKV \u03b2e = 1,\n\nwhere \u03b2e \u2282 R\u2032 is the support of \u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b2). The adjunction formula gives \u03b2e2 = \u22123,\nthus \u03b2 2 = \u22126. Notice that \u03b2e is the only component of R\u2032 which is not\ncontracted by the map \u03b3 \u25e6 h.\nLet\n\u03b1 := B \u2032 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2282 W,\n\u03b2 := \u03c1(\u03b2), \u03b1 := \u03c1(\u03b1) \u2282 P.\nWhen \u03b1 is non-empty, the support of \u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b1) is an union of (\u22122)-curves, since\nit is contracted by \u03b3 \u25e6 h. Equivalently \u03b1 is a disjoint union of (\u22124)-curves.\nClaim 5: We have\n2\nKW\n\u2265 \u22122.\n\nProof : Consider the Chern number c2 and the second Betti number b2 . It is\nwell known that, for a surface X,\n2\nc2 (X) = 12\u03c7(OX ) \u2212 KX\n, b2 (X) = c2 (X) \u2212 2 + 4q(X).\n\nTherefore\n2\nb2 (W ) = 22 \u2212 KW\n, b2 (V ) = b2 (S) + t = 11 + 13 = 24.\n2\nThe inequality KW\n\u2265 \u22122 follows from the fact b2 (V ) \u2265 b2 (W ). \u22c4\n\nFrom Claim 5, we conclude that the resolution of B \u2032 blows-up at most\ntwo double points, thus\nB \u20322 \u2265 \u22122 + 2(\u22124) = \u221210 = \u03b2 2 + (\u22124).\nThis implies that \u03b1 is a smooth (\u22124)-curve when \u03b1 6= 0.\nClaim 6: Only the following possibilities can occur:\n* \u03b2 has one double point and no other singularity, or\n* \u03b1, \u03b2 are smooth, \u03b1\u03b2 = 2.\n\n13\n\n\fProof : Recall that B \u2032 = \u03b1 + \u03b2 is contained in fibres of fA and, since B \u2032 has\nonly negligible singularities, then also B \u2032 = \u03b1 + \u03b2 is contained in fibres of fA .\n2\nIn particular \u03b12 , \u03b2 \u2264 0.\nIf \u03b1 is singular, then it has arithmetic genus pa (\u03b1) = 1 and \u03b12 = 0. But\nthen \u03b1 has the same support of a fibre of fA , which is a contradiction because\nfA is not elliptic. Therefore \u03b1 is smooth.\nSince KP \u03b1 \u2265 0, KP B \u2032 = 2 implies KP \u03b2 \u2264 2. We know that \u03b2 is a smooth\nrational curve and \u03b2 2 = \u22126, thus KW \u03b2 = 4. If \u03b2 is smooth, then one must\nhave \u03b1\u03b2 > 1. From Claim 5 the only possibility in this case is \u03b1\u03b2 = 2. If \u03b2\n2\nis singular, then \u03b2 \u2264 0 implies that \u03b2 has one ordinary double point and no\nother singularity. \u22c4\nLet D := \u03b2 if \u03b2 is singular. Otherwise let D := \u03b1 + \u03b2.\nf =\nf := 1 (\u03c1 \u25e6 \u03c0)\u2217 (D) has arithmetic genus p (D)\nThe 2-connected divisor D\na\n2\nf = 1 (because K R\u2032 = 1) and that D\nf contains\n1. We know that (KV + n\u039b)D\nV\na component A such that (KV + n\u039b)A = 0 (because D has at least one\nnegligible singularity). These two facts imply, from [CFM, Proposition A.5,\nf As mentioned\n(ii)], that the relative canonical map \u03b3 has a base point in D.\nabove, \u03b3 is a morphism, which is a contradiction.\nFinally the assertion about deg(\u03c62 ) in Case 2): we have proved that S has\na genus 2 fibration, so it has an hyperelliptic involution j. The bicanonical\nmap \u03c62 factors through both i and j, thus deg(\u03c62 ) \u2265 4.\nThis finishes the proof of case a), (ii) of Theorem 1.\nWe end the proof of Theorem 1 with Case a), (iii): A surface of general type with a genus 2 fibration and pg = q = 1 satisfies K 2 \u2264 6 (see\n[Xi1]). Denote by j the map such that \u03c62 = j \u25e6 i. The quotient S/i is a K3\nsurface thus, from [Do], deg(j) \u2264 2. Analogously to Case 2, deg (\u03c62 ) \u2265 4,\nthus deg(j) = 2, deg(\u03c62 ) = 4 and then KS2 6= 2 (see Case 1).\nIt follows from [Xi1, p. 66] that, if the genus 2 fibration of S has a\nrational basis, then KS2 = 3. It is shown in [Po1] that, in these conditions,\ndeg(\u03c62 ) = 2. We then conclude that the genus 2 fibration of S is the Albanese\nfibration.\nExamples for case a), (iii) with KS2 = 3, 4 or 5 were given by Catanese\nin [Ca2]. The existence of the other cases is proved in the next section.\n\n14\n\n\f5\n\nExamples\n\nIn this section we will construct smooth minimal surfaces of general type S\nwith pg (S) = q(S) = 1 having an involution i such that the bicanonical map\n\u03c62 of S is composed with i and:\n1) KS2 = 6, g = 3, deg(\u03c62 ) = 2, S/i is birational to a K3 surface;\n2) KS2 = 4, g = 2, Kod(S/i) = 1;\n3) KS2 = 2, g = 2, Kod(S/i) = 2,\nwhere g denotes the genus of the Albanese fibration of S.\nExample 1:\nIn [To] Todorov gives the following construction of a surface of general type\nS with pg (S) = 1, q(S) = 0 and KS2 = 8. Consider a Kummer surface Q in\nIP 3 , i. e. a quartic having has only singularities 16 nodes (ordinary double\ne be the\npoints). Let G \u2282 Q be the intersection of Q with a general quadric, Q\ne\ne\nminimal resolution of Q and G \u2282 Q be the pullback of G. The surface S is\ne ramified over G\ne + P16 A ,\nthe minimal model of the double cover \u03c0 : V \u2192 Q\ni\n1\ne\nwhere Ai \u2282 Q, i = 1, . . . , 16, are the (\u22122)-curves which contract to the nodes\nof Q.\nIt follows from the double cover formulas (cf. [BPV, Ch. V, \u00a722]) that\nthe imposition of a quadruple point to the branch locus decreases K 2 by 2\nand the Euler characteristic \u03c7 by 1.\nWe will see that we can impose a quadruple point to the branch locus\nof the Todorov construction, thus obtaining S with KS2 = 6. In this case I\ne blown-up at the\nclaim that pg (S) = q(S) = 1. In fact, let W be the surface Q\nquadruple point, E be the corresponding (\u22121)-curve, B be the branch locus\nand L be the line bundle such that 2L \u2261 B. From formula (3) in Section\n2, one has h0 (W, OW (2E + L)) = 0 (thus the bicanonical map of V factors\nthrough \u03c0), hence also h0 (W, OW (E + L)) = 0 and then\npg (S) = pg (W ) + h0 (W, OW (E + L)) = 1.\nWe will see that deg(\u03c62 ) = 2, hence \u03c62 (S) is a K3 surface and so S has\nno genus 2 fibration.\nFirst we need to obtain an equation of a Kummer surface. The Computational Algebra System Magma has a direct way to do this, but I prefer to\ndo it using a beautiful construction that I learned from Miles Reid.\n15\n\n\fWe want a quartic surface Q \u2208 IP 3 whose singularities are exactly 16\nnodes. Projecting from one of the nodes to IP 2, one realizes the \"Kummer\"\nsurface as a double cover\n\u03c8 : X \u2212\u2192 IP 2\nwith branch locus the union of 6 lines Li (see [GH, p. 774]), each one tangent\nto a conic C (the image of the projection point) at a point pi . The surface\nX contains 15 nodes (from the intersection of the lines) and two (\u22122)-curves\n(the pullback \u03c8 \u2217 (C)) disjoint from these nodes. To obtain a Kummer surface\nwe have just to contract one of these curves.\nDenote also by Li the defining polynomial of each line Li . An equation\nfor X is z 2 = L1 * * * L6 in the weighted projective space IP (3, 1, 1, 1), with\ncoordinates (z, x1 , x2 , x3 ). We will see that this equation can be written in\nthe form AB + DE = 0, where the system A = B = D = E = 0 has\nonly the trivial solution and B, E are the defining polynomials of one of the\n(\u22122)-curves in \u03c8 \u2217 (C). Now consider the surface X \u2032 given by Bs = D, Es =\n\u2212A in the space IP (3, 1, 1, 1, 1) with coordinates (z, s, x1 , x2 , x3 ). There is a\nmorphism X \u2192 X \u2032 which restricts to an isomorphism\nX \u2212 {B = E = 0} \u2212\u2192 X \u2032 \u2212 {[0 : 1 : 0 : 0 : 0]}\nand which contracts the curve {B = E = 0} to the point [0 : 1 : 0 : 0 : 0].\nThis is an example of unprojection (see [Re]).\nThe variable z appears isolated in the equations of X \u2032 , therefore eliminating z we obtain the equation of the Kummer Q in IP 3 with variables\n(s, x1 , x2 , x3 ). All this calculations will be done using Magma.\nIn what follows a line preceded by > is an input line, something preceded\nby // is a comment.

Since the computer is not\nfast enough while working with more than 5 or 6 variables, we first need to\nthink what the most probable case is.\nP\nLike we have seen in Section 3, the branch locus B \u2032 + 16\n1 Ai is contained\nin 4 fibres FA1 , . . . , FA4 of a fibration fA of W, where W is the resolution of Q\nblown-up at pt and the Ai 's are the (\u22122)-curves which contract to the nodes\nof Q.\nOf course we have a quadric intersecting Q at a curve with a quadruple\npoint pt : the tangent space T to Q at pt counted twice. But this one is\ndouble, so we need to find an irreducible one (and these two induce fA ), the\ncurve B \u2032 . These curves 2T and B \u2032 are good candidates for FA1 and FA2 (in\nthe notation of Sections 3 and 4). If this configuration exists, then the 16\nnodes must be contained in the other two fibres, FA3 and FA4 . These fibres are\ndivisible by 2, because FA1 = 2T, and are double outside the nodes. Since in a\nK3 surface only 0, 8 or 16 nodes can have sum divisible by 2, it is reasonable\nto try the following configuration: each of FA3 and FA4 contain 8 nodes with\nsum divisible by 2 and is double outside the nodes.\nIt is well known (see e. g. [GH]) that the Kummer surface Q has 16\ndouble hyperplane sections Ti such that each one contains 6 nodes of Q and\nthat any two of them intersect in 2 nodes. The sum of the 8 nodes contained\nin\nN := (T1 \u222a T2 )\\(T 1 \u2229 T2 )\nis divisible by 2.

For each j \u2208 {1, 2, 3} let Cj be the conic through p1 , p2 , p3 tangent\nto the Li 's except for Lj . Denote by D a general element of the linear system\ngenerated by 3C1 + 2L1 , 3C2 + 2L2 and 3C3 + 2L3 . The singularities of D are\na (3, 3)-point at pi , tangent to Li , i = 1, 2, 3, and a double point at p0 . Let\nL4 be a line through p0 transverse to D.\nDenote by W \u2032 the canonical resolution of the double cover of IP 2 with\nbranch locus\nD + L1 + . . . + L4\nand by W the minimal model of W \u2032 . The formulas of [BPV, Ch. V, \u00a722]\n2\n= 1 (notice that the map W \u2032 \u2192 W contracts three\ngive \u03c7(W ) = 2 and KW\n(\u22121)-curves contained in the pullback of L1 + L2 + L3 ). Since K 2 \u2265 2pg for\nan irregular surface ([De]), W is regular and then pg (W ) = \u03c7(W ) \u2212 1 = 1.\nStep 2: The branch locus in W.\nThe pencil of lines through p0 induces a (genus 2) fibration of W. Let Fi be\nthe fibre induced by Li , i = 1, . . . , 4. The fibre F4 is the union of six disjoint\n23\n\n\f(\u22122)-curves (corresponding to the nodes of D \u2212p0 ) with a double component\n(the strict transform of L4 ). Each Fi , i = 1, 2, 3, is the union of two (\u22122)curves with a double component (cf. [Xi1, \u00a71]). Thus F1 + * * * + F4 contain\ndisjoint (\u22122)-curves A1 , . . . , A12 such that\n12\nX\n\nAi \u2261 0 (mod 2).\n\n1\n\nStep 3: Construction of S.\nP\nLet V be the double cover of W with branch locus 12\n1 Ai and S be the minimal model of V. From (1) we obtain \u03c7(OS ) = 1 and KV2 = \u221210. The Ai 's lift\nto (\u22121)-curves in V, thus KS2 = \u221210 + 12 = 2. We have 1 = pg (W ) \u2264 pg (S),\nhence q(S) 6= 0 and then 2 = KS2 \u2265 2pg (S). So pg (S) = q(S) = 1.\nThe genus 2 fibration of W induces the Albanese fibration of S.\n\nReferences\n[Be]\n\nA.
