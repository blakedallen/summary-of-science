The models proposed for the evaluation\nof the \u039b decay widths are summarized and their results are compared with the data.\nThe rates \u0393NM = \u0393n +\u0393p (+\u03932 ), \u0393\u03c00 and \u0393\u03c0\u2212 are well explained by several calculations.\nDespite the intensive investigations of the last years, the main open problem remains\na sound theoretical interpretation of the large experimental values of the ratio \u0393n /\u0393p .\nHowever, the large uncertainties involved in the experimental determination of the\nratio do not allow to reach any definitive conclusion. The \u0393n /\u0393p puzzle is strongly\nrelated to the so\u2013called \u2206I = 1/2 rule on the isospin change in the non\u2013mesonic decay,\nwhose possible violation cannot be established at present, again due to the insufficient\nprecision of the data. Although recent works offer a step forward in the solution of\nthe puzzle, further efforts (especially on the experimental side) must be invested in\norder to understand the detailed dynamics of the non\u2013mesonic decay. Even if, by\nmeans of single nucleon spectra measurements, the error bars on \u0393n /\u0393p have been\nconsiderably reduced very recently at KEK (however, with central data compatible\nwith older experiments), a clean extraction of \u0393n /\u0393p is needed. What is missing at\npresent, but planned for the next future, are measurements of 1) nucleon energy spectra\nin double coincidence and 2) nucleon angular correlations: such observations allow to\ndisentangle the nucleons produced in one\u2013 and two\u2013body induced decays and lead to a\ndirect determination of \u0393n /\u0393p . Notably, the two\u2013body component of the non\u2013mesonic\ndecay rates has not been measured yet, due to the too low counting rates expected\nfor a coincidence experiment. For the asymmetric non\u2013mesonic decay of polarized\nhypernuclei the situation is even more puzzling. Indeed, strong inconsistencies appear\nalready among data. A recent experiment obtained a positive intrinsic \u039b asymmetry\n~ This is in complete disagreement with a previous measurement,\nparameter, a\u039b , for 5\u039b He.\nwhich obtained a large and negative a\u039b for p\u2013shell hypernuclei, and with theory, which\npredicts a negative value moderately dependent on nuclear structure effects. Also in\nthis case, improved experiments establishing with certainty the sign and magnitude of\na\u039b for s\u2013 and p\u2013shell hypernuclei will provide a guidance for a deeper understanding\nof hypernuclear dynamics and decay mechanisms.\nKeywords: Production and structure of hypernuclei; mesonic and non\u2013mesonic decay of\n\u039b\u2013hypernuclei; \u0393n /\u0393p puzzle; \u2206I = 1/2 isospin rule; decay of polarized \u039b\u2013hypernuclei.\nPACS: 21.80.+a, 13.75.Ev, 25.40.-h\n\n\f\fContents\n1 Hyperons and hypernuclei\n\n1\n\n1.1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n1\n\n1.2 Hyperon\u2013nucleon, hyperon\u2013hyperon interactions and hypernuclear structure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2 Production of hypernuclei\n\n2\n13\n\n2.1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n13\n\n2.2 The (K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u00b1 ) strangeness exchange reactions . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n14\n\n2.3 The n(\u03c0 + , K + )\u039b strangeness associated production reaction . . . . .\n\n17\n\n2.4 The p(e, e\u2032 , K + )\u039b reaction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n18\n\n3 Weak decay modes of \u039b\u2013hypernuclei\n\n19\n\n3.1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n19\n\n3.2 Mesonic decay . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n19\n\n3.3 Non\u2013mesonic decay . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n22\n\n3.3.1\n\nThe \u0393n /\u0393p puzzle . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n4 Present status of experiment and theory\n\n24\n26\n\n4.1 Experiment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n26\n\n4.2 Theory . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n28\n\n5 Models for calculation\n\n48\n\n5.1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n48\n\n5.2 Wave Function Method: mesonic decay . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n48\n\n5.3 Wave Function Method: non\u2013mesonic decay . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n49\n\n5.4 Polarization Propagator Method and Local Density Approximation .\n\n51\n\n5.4.1\n\nNuclear matter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n52\n\n5.4.2\n\nFinite nuclei . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n57\n\n5.4.3\n\nPhenomenological 2p\u20132h propagator . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n57\n\n5.5 Functional approach to the \u039b self\u2013energy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n58\n\nI\n\n\f5.5.1\n\nThe bosonic effective action . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n61\n\n5.5.2\n\nSemiclassical expansion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n62\n\n5.6 Results of the phenomenological calculation . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n68\n\n12\n\u039bC\n\n5.6.1\n\nShort range correlations and \u039b wave function \u2013\n\n. . . . . .\n\n69\n\n5.6.2\n\nDecay widths of light to heavy \u039b\u2013hypernuclei . . . . . . . . .\n\n72\n\n5.7 Results of the microscopic calculation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n73\n\n6 The \u0393n /\u0393p puzzle\n\n84\n\n6.1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n84\n\n6.2 Two\u2013body induced decay and nucleon final state interactions . . . . .\n\n86\n\n6.2.1\n\nRecent experimental spectra . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n90\n\n6.2.2\n\nPossible improvements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n92\n\n6.2.3\n\nPotentialities of coincidence experiments . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n94\n\n6.3 Phenomenological analysis of s\u2013shell hypernuclei . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n98\n\n6.3.1\n\nExperimental data and \u2206I = 1/2 rule . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 101\n\n7 Non\u2013mesonic decay of polarized \u039b\u2013hypernuclei: the asymmetry puzzle\n\n106\n\n7.1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 106\n7.2 Spin\u2013polarization observables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 107\n7.3 Experiments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 108\n7.4 Theory vs experiment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 111\n8 Summary and perspective\n\n114\n\nA Spin\u2013isospin NN \u2192 NN and \u039bN \u2192 NN interactions\n\n117\n\nII\n\n\f1\n\nHyperons and hypernuclei\n\n1.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nHyperons (\u039b, \u03a3, \u039e, \u03a9) have lifetimes of the order of 10\u221210 sec (apart from the \u03a30 ,\nwhich decays into \u039b\u03b3).

A crucial point to describe the structure of these strange nuclei is the knowledge\nof the elementary hyperon\u2013nucleon (Y N) and hyperon\u2013hyperon (Y Y ) interactions.\nHyperon masses differ remarkably from the nucleonic mass, hence the flavour SU(3)\nsymmetry is broken. The amount of this breaking is a fundamental question in order\nto understand the baryon\u2013baryon interaction in the strange sector.\nAmong hyperons and nucleons the following esoenergetic strong reactions (\u2206S =\n0) are allowed:\n\u03a3\u2212 p \u2192 \u039bn\n\u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u039b\n\u03a9\u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u039e0\n\n\u03a3+ n \u2192 \u039bp (Q \u2243 78MeV)\n\u039e0 n \u2192 \u039b\u039b (Q \u2243 26MeV)\n\u03a9\u2212 n \u2192 \u039b\u039e\u2212 (Q \u2243 178MeV)\n\n(in parentheses are quoted the average released energies, the so\u2013called Q\u2013values),\nhence, only the lightest hyperon (\u039b) is generally stable with respect to the strong\nprocesses which occur in nuclear systems. In this review we shall be mainly concerned\nwith \u039b\u2013hypernuclei.\nThe existence of hypernuclei is interesting since it gives a new dimension to the\ntraditional world of nuclei (states with new symmetries, selection rules, etc). In fact,\nthey represent the first kind of flavoured nuclei, in the direction of other exotic systems\n(charmed nuclei and so on).\nHypernuclear physics was born in 1952, when the first hypernucleus was observed\nthrough its decays [1]. Since then, it has known several phases of development and\nit has been characterized by more and more new challenging questions and answers.\nHowever, this field has experienced great advances only in the last 10\u201315 years. We\ncan look at hypernuclear physics as a good tool to match nuclear and particle physics.\nNowadays, the knowledge of hypernuclear phenomena is rather good, but some open\nproblems still remain. Actually, the study of this field may help in understanding\nsome crucial questions, related, to list a few, to:\n\u2022 some aspects of the baryon\u2013baryon weak interactions;\n\u2022 the Y N and Y Y strong interactions in the J P = 1/2+ baryon octet;\n\u2022 the possible existence of di\u2013baryon particles;\n\u2022 the renormalization of hyperon and meson properties in the nuclear medium;\n\u2022 the nuclear structure: for instance, the long standing question of the origin of the\nspin\u2013orbit interaction and other aspects of the many\u2013body nuclear dynamics;\n\u2022 the role played by quark degrees of freedom, flavour symmetry and chiral models\nin nuclear and hypernuclear phenomena.\nIn this review we will widely discuss a great deal of these problems.\n1\n\n\f1.2\n\nHyperon\u2013nucleon, hyperon\u2013hyperon interactions and hypernuclear structure\n\nWe summarize here the phenomenological information available nowadays on Y N\nand Y Y interactions and on the structure of \u039b\u2013, \u03a3\u2013, \u039e\u2013 and \u039b\u039b\u2013hypernuclei.\nOne of the main reasons of interest in hypernuclear physics lies in the characteristics of the Y N and Y Y interactions which can be derived from. Obviously, measurements of Y N and Y Y cross sections would give more direct information. However,\nsuch experiments are very difficult due to the short lifetime of the hyperons, which\ngives flight paths limited to less than 10 cm: nowadays, no scattering data are available on the Y Y interaction and very limited are the ones for the \u039bN, \u03a3N and \u039eN\ninteractions (especially in the last case). Moreover, we remind the reader that the\ninverse reaction pn \u2192 p\u039b in free space is under investigation at COSY (J\u00fclich) [2]\nand KEK [3]. Unfortunately, the experimental observation of this process is difficult\nbecause of its very low cross section [4] with respect to the huge background.\nThe NN interaction can be understood in terms of one\u2013meson\u2013exchange (OME)\nmodels, usually combined with a proper parameterization of the repulsive component\nat short distance, which originates from quark exchanges between the hadrons and\n> 400\nhas a range of about 0.5 fm, corresponding to a transferred momentum q \u223c\nP\nMeV. The extension of the OME description to strange particles of the J = 1/2+\nbaryon octet is still unsatisfactory. Several models of the Y N and Y Y interactions\nare available. For instance, with the help of the flavour SU(3) symmetry, the Bonn\u2013\nJ\u00fclich [5] and Nijmegen [6\u20138] groups have developed several potentials using the OME\npicture, also including, in some cases, two\u2013meson\u2013exchange. In addition to meson\u2013\nexchange potentials, other groups (Tokyo [9], T\u00fcbingen [10] and Kyoto\u2013Niigata [11])\nuse quark cluster models to explain the short range interactions. Unfortunately, none\nof these potentials is fully satisfactory and there are large discrepancies among the\ndifferent models (especially on the spin\u2013isospin dependence). Since the data on Y N\nscattering are very limited (they consist almost exclusively of spin\u2013averaged cross\nsections), it is impossible to fit the Y N interaction unambiguously: different Y N\npotentials can reproduce the data equally well, but they exhibit differences on a more\ndetailed level, especially when the spin structure is concerned (compare for example\nRefs. [5, 7, 11]). The measurement of spin observables in the Y N scattering as well\nas in the weak process pn \u2192 p\u039b could discriminate among the various interaction\nmodels. On the other hand, the study of the hypernuclear structure and weak decays\nis helpful in order to get useful information on the Y N and Y Y interactions.\n\u039bN interaction and \u039b\u2013hypernuclei\nThe strong \u039bN interaction displays some different aspects with respect to the NN\none. For instance, due to isospin conservation in strong interactions, the fact that the\n\u039b has isospin I = 0 forbids the emission of a pion (\u039b/\u2192\u039b\u03c0). In figure 1 we depict the\nNN and \u039bN strong potentials in the OME model. The strong \u039b \u2192 \u03a3\u03c0 and \u03a3 \u2192 \u039b\u03c0\ncouplings are allowed, and the \u039b hyperon can interact with a nucleon by exchanging\nan even number of pions and/or of \u03c1 mesons (see figure 2). The dominant part of the\n\u039bN interaction comes from the two\u2013pion\u2013exchange, hence it has a shorter range than\nthe NN one. Moreover, the \u039bN potential is weaker than the NN potential: roughly\n2\n\n\fN\n\n\u039b\n\nN\n\n\u03c0, \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03b7\n\nN\n\nN\n\n\u03c9, \u03b7\n\n\u039b\n\nN\n\nN\n\nFigure 1: NN and \u039bN strong amplitudes in the one\u2013meson\u2013exchange model.\n\n\u039b\n\nN\n\n\u03c0 (\u03c1)\n\u03a3\n\nN\n\u03c0 (\u03c1)\n\n\u039b\n\nN\n\nFigure 2: Two pion (\u03c1) exchange contribution to the \u039bN potential.\n\n3\n\n\f\u039b\n\nN\n\nN\n\u039b\n\nN\n\n\u03c0\nK\n\n\u03a3\n\u03c0\n\nN\n\n\u039b\n\n\u039b\n\nN\n\nN\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nFigure 3: \u039b three\u2013body interaction (a) and two\u2013body interaction with strangeness\nexchange (b).\n\nspeaking, from the diagrams of figures 1 and 2, for the tensorial components we have:\nT\nV\u039bN\n/VNTN \u2243 1/4.\nBesides, three\u2013body interactions and two\u2013body interactions with strangeness exchange are also allowed (figure 3). The \u039bNN three\u2013body force, whose pionic component is depicted in Fig. 3(a), is an important ingredient to investigate the structure of\n\u039b\u2013hypernuclei [12\u201314], especially in light systems. This is due to the \u039bN\u2013\u03a3N strong\ncoupling, which is sizeable in the nuclear medium [15\u201319], and, on the other hand,\nleads to a non\u2013negligible second order tensor force in the \u039bN interaction (Fig. 2). By\nassuming a repulsive \u039bNN potential, the small \u039b binding energies in light hypernuclei\nand the depth of the \u039b\u2013nucleus mean potential for heavy systems can be reproduced\n[13] without requiring a strong spin\u2013dependence of the \u039bN interaction; the latter\nseems, at present, to be excluded (see following discussion in this paragraph). In\nparticular, the \u039bNN interaction is essential to explain the existence of the lightest\nhypernucleus, the hypertriton (3\u039b H\u2261 pn\u039b), which is weakly bound. The \u039b binding\nenergy, defined as:\nA+1\nA\nB\u039b (A+1\n\u039b Z) \u2261 M(\u039b Z) \u2212 M( Z) \u2212 m\u039b < 0,\n\nis as small as \u2243 130 KeV in hypertriton. In Ref. [20], within a microscopic many\u2013\nbody scheme, the authors showed how the coupling to intermediate \u03a3N states in\nthe \u039bN interaction (figure 2) is crucial for a correct evaluation of the \u039b binding\nenergy in nuclear matter. In hypernuclei the \u039bN\u2013\u03a3N coupling is more important\n[especially because of the relatively small \u039b\u2013\u03a3 mass difference (\u2243 78 MeV)] than the\nNN\u2013\u2206N coupling in conventional nuclei, where the latter plays a very small role in\nbinding few\u2013nucleon systems (m\u2206 \u2212 mN \u2243 293 MeV). Another signal of the \u039bN\u2013\u03a3N\n4\n\n\fcoupling comes from the observation that in S\u2013wave relative states the \u039bp interaction\nis more attractive than the \u039bn interaction. This follows from a comparison of the\nexperimental \u039b binding energies in the A = 3, I = 1/2 doublet:\nB\u039b (4\u039b He) \u2212 B\u039b (4\u039b H)\n0.35MeV\n=\n\u2243 0.15\n4\nB\u039b (\u039b He)\n2.39MeV\n(4\u039b He = ppn\u039b and 4\u039b H = pnn\u039b should differ only because of Coulomb effects, if\nthe \u039bn and \u039bp interactions were of equal strength). The \u039bN\u2013\u03a3N coupling gives a\ncharge symmetry breaking more important than the one observed in ordinary nuclei\nby comparing the neutron separation energies in 3 H and 3 He (after correcting for the\nCoulomb interaction in 3 He). The Coulomb energy in 4\u039b He is expected to be only a\nlittle more repulsive than in 3 He: EC (4\u039b He) \u2212 EC (3 He) \u2243 0.02 MeV. Large part of\nthe charge symmetry breaking observed in light \u039b\u2013hypernuclei is due to the coupling\nbetween the \u039bN and \u03a3N channels and turns out to be quite sensitive to the mass\ndifference between the initial and final state:\n\u2206m(\u039bp \u2192 \u03a3+ n) \u2243 75 MeV < \u2206m(\u039bn \u2192 \u03a3\u2212 p) \u2243 80.5 MeV\n\n(for transitions without charge exchange, \u039bp \u2192 \u03a30 p and \u039bn \u2192 \u03a30 n, \u2206m \u2243 77 MeV).\nAnother important aspect of the \u039bN interaction is its spin\u2013dependence. A qualitative indication of the difference between the singlet (J = 0) and triplet (J = 1) \u039bN\ninteractions comes from the comparison of the \u039b binding energy in isobar nuclei not\nrelated by charge symmetry. For example, |B\u039b (7\u039b Li)| is larger than |B\u039b (7\u039b Be)| by about\n0.42 MeV. The greater |B\u039b | value corresponds to the hypernucleus whose nucleons'\ncore has non\u2013zero spin (being an odd\u2013odd system, while the core of 7\u039b Be is even\u2013\neven); it can be explained by the effect of the spin\u2013dependent \u039b interaction with the\nunpaired nucleons, a proton and a neutron, in 7\u039b Li. However, the \u039bN spin\u2013spin interaction is weak. In ref [21] the \u039b\u2013core spin doublet splittings (J = |Jcore \u00b1 1/2|), which\ngive the strength of the \u039bN spin\u2013spin interaction, are predicted to be of the order of\n0.1 MeV for p\u2013shell hypernuclei, and only for 7\u039b Li in the ground state this splitting\nis sizeably larger (\u2243 0.6 MeV). The recent measurements, at KEK and BNL [22, 23],\n+\n+\nof the energy spacing of the 7\u039b Li ground state doublet, M1( 23 \u2192 12 ) = 691.7 \u00b1 1.2\nKeV, and of various \u03b3\u2013ray transitions in other p\u2013shell hypernuclei confirmed this\nprediction [24]. Experiments with high energy resolution are then essential to study\nthe spin\u2013dependence of the \u039bN interaction. From the analysis of the spins of ground\nand excited states in \u039b\u2013hypernuclei one expects the \u039bN interaction to be more attractive in the spin\u2013singlet state than in the spin\u2013triplet state [25]. In Ref. [10] the\nauthors found that the quark cluster model gives more attraction in the triplet interaction; moreover, their meson\u2013exchange potentials are almost spin\u2013independent. In\nthe phenomenological OME models of the \u039bN interaction the situation is not clear\n[5\u20137]: since there is no direct empirical information about the spin structure of the\npotential, some versions favour the singlet interaction, while others favour the triplet\none. It has been found [26, 27] that the \u039bN effective interaction has repulsive character in the spin\u2013parity J P = 0+ channel, while for the NN interaction an attractive\n0+ pairing is well known. This anti\u2013pairing effect originates from a delicate balance\nbetween the \u039bN inner repulsion and the attraction at intermediate distances.\nThe spin\u2013orbit component of the \u039b\u2013nucleus mean potential is rather small. The\nspin\u2013orbit separation of the \u039b levels is at least one order of magnitude smaller than\n5\n\n\fthe one typical of the N\u2013nucleus interaction [18, 21, 24, 28\u201333]. Such effect could\noriginate from the weak tensor component of the \u039bN interaction, whose most important contributions come from the exchange, forbidden at the lowest order, of pions\nand rhos. This supports the hypothesis that the strong one\u2013body spin\u2013orbit potential\nexperienced in ordinary nuclei (central point in order to explain their exact shell structure) originates from a two\u2013body tensor force. However this point is not completely\nclear yet. In fact, forces besides the spin\u2013orbit one [24] as well as core excitations\n[32, 34, 35] may contribute to the observed splittings as well. We will further discuss\nthe problem of the spin\u2013orbit interaction in \u039b\u2013hypernuclei in the next section.\nWhen a hyperon is embedded in the nucleus, one has to take into account the\ninfluence of the medium on the hyperon. A simple mean field picture turns out\nto be a good description of the bulk hypernuclear properties [36] (for example the\nhyperons binding energies and the excitation functions). Within this approximation\nthe hyperon maintains its single particle behaviour in the medium, and it is well known\nthat this occurs even for states well below the Fermi surface [37, 38], a property which\nis not observed for the nucleons. This is due to the fact that in hypernuclei the \u039b is\na distinguishable particle, which weakly interacts with the nucleons' core. However,\ndeviations from the independent particle description can be produced, for instance,\nby three\u2013body forces, \u039bN\u2013\u03a3N and \u039b\u039b\u2013\u039eN couplings, QCD effects at the nuclear\nlevel and non\u2013localities due to relativistic effects.\nOn the other hand, the presence of a hyperon influences the nuclear medium:\nhence, the Hartree\u2013Fock approximation acquires a new self\u2013consistency requirement\nin strange nuclei. In spite of the relative weakness of the \u039bN interaction (with respect\nto the NN interaction), for particular nucleon configurations the single particle levels\nmay be considerably lowered by the presence of a \u039b: for the deepest ones the energy\nshift can reach 3 \u00f7 5 MeV, while for the valence orbits a value of about 1 MeV\nis frequent [27]. For example, the extra 1p neutron binding energy for a p\u2013shell\nA\nhypernucleus A+1\n\u039b Z due to the addition of the \u039b to the nucleus Z is calculable with\nthe following relation:\n1p A\nA+1\nA\nBn1p (A+1\n\u039b Z) \u2212 Bn ( Z) = B\u039b (\u039b Z) \u2212 B\u039b (\u039b Z) < 0.\n\nFor a 1s neutron:\n1p A+1\nA\n\u2217 A\nBn1s (A+1\n\u039b Z) = Bn (\u039b Z) + M(\u039b Z) \u2212 M (\u039b Z),\nA\nwhere M \u2217 (A\n\u039b Z) is the mass of the 1s neutron\u2013hole excited state of \u039b Z, which can be\n\u2212\n\u2212\nA+1\nproduced by the K n \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 reaction on\nZ, through the transformation of a\n1s neutron into a 1s \u039b\u2013hyperon (see next section). Similar relations hold for the\nproton levels. The stability of the nucleons' core is increased by the presence of the\n\u039b particle, which plays then a \"glue\u2013like\" role. Remarkable examples are 5 He and\n8\nBe vs 6\u039b He and 9\u039b Be, the former being unstable and the latter stable with respect\nto strong particle emission. very recent \u03b3\u2013ray spectroscopy experiment at KEK [39]\nshowed that the size of the 6 Li core in 7\u039b Li is reduced with respect to that of the\nloosely bound 6 Li nucleus. In a 5\u039b He\u2013d (4 He\u2013d) cluster model for 7\u039b Li (6 Li) [40], the\nrms distance between 5\u039b He and d in 7\u039b Li is about 19% smaller than the one between\n4\nHe and d in 6 Li. The role of stabilizer of the \u039b in nuclei is due to its position in the\ninner part of the nucleons' core, on single particle levels which are forbidden, by the\n\n6\n\n\fPauli principle, to the nucleons. On the other hand, the weak decay of the \u039b may\ncause the delayed fission of the host nucleus (because of the decreased stability and\nenergy release of the decay). This process has been used to measure the lifetime of\nheavy hypernuclei [41, 42].\nWe consider now the different behaviours, in nuclei, of neutron and \u039b due to their\ndecay modes. In the free space neutron and \u039b are unstable; they decay through the\nfollowing weak channels:\nn \u2192 p e\u2212 \u03bd e (100%),\n\u039b \u2192 \u03c0\u2212 p\n(63.9%),\n0\n\u03c0 n\n(35.8%).\nThe energy released in the neutron free decay is Qfree\n\u2261 mn \u2212 (mp + me ) \u2243 0.78\nn\nMeV, while the binding energy of a nucleon in the nucleus is (in the average) BN \u2243\n\u22128 MeV, therefore a neutron in a nucleus is generally stable (namely its decay is\nkinematically forbidden). On the other hand, for the \u039b free decay the released energy\nis Qfree\n\u039b \u2261 m\u039b \u2212 (m\u03c0 + mN ) \u2243 40 MeV. This is larger than the nuclear \u039b separation\n< 27 MeV (especially in light hypernuclei), hence the \u039b is kinematically\nenergy: |B\u039b | \u223c\nunstable even if embedded in nuclear systems.\nThe binding energies of nucleon and \u039b in nuclei, BN and B\u039b , have different behaviours as a function of the mass number: BN saturates at about \u22128 MeV for nuclei\n> 10, while |B\u039b | monotonically increases with A up to \u2243 27 MeV for 208\nwith A \u223c\n\u039b Pb.\nIndeed, the \u039b can occupy whatever single particle state, the ground state of the hypernucleus always corresponding to the hyperon in the 1s level. It is then clear that\na \u039b particle is a good probe of the inner part of nuclei. Actually, the Pauli principle\nis active on the u and d quarks of nucleons and \u039b when they are very close to each\nother. For example, in the case of 5\u039b He\u2261 ppnn\u039b, if the constituent baryons maintain\ntheir identity, both the hyperon and the nucleons occupy s levels, while at the quark\nlevel an up quark in the \u039bp short range interaction (and a down quark in \u039bn) has to\noccupy the p\u2013level. The Pauli blocking effect at the quark level could be an important ingredient to explain the anomalously small 5\u039b He binding energy with respect to\ncalculations performed within the baryon picture. A study of the role played by the\nquark Pauli principle on the binding energies of single\u2013 and double\u2013\u039b s\u2013shell hypernuclei can be found in Ref. [43]. The authors have found significant effects when the\nassumed size of the baryons is of the order of the proton charge radius: b \u2243 0.86 fm.\nWith the exception of hypernuclei of the s\u2013shell, the depth of the \u039b\u2013nucleus\nmean field is of about 30 MeV [36], namely it is less attractive than the one typical\nfor a nucleon (\u2243 50 \u00f7 55 MeV). This characteristic reflects the smaller range and\nthe weakness of the \u039bN interaction at intermediate distances with respect to the NN\none. It is possible to reproduce the experimental single particle \u039b levels using Woods\u2013\nSaxon wells with the above depth and appropriate radii. For s\u2013shell hypernuclei the\n\u039b single particle potential displays a repulsive soft core at short distances [44\u201346].\nA measure of this effect is given by the rms radii for a nucleon and a \u039b in these\nhypernuclei: the hyperon rms radius is larger than the one for a nucleon.\n\n7\n\n\f\u03a3N interaction and \u03a3\u2013hypernuclei\nThe investigation of the \u03a3N interaction is richer but more difficult than that of the\n\u039bN interaction. We remind the reader that it exhibits a long range OPE component,\nits central part is weaker than the \u039bN one and it is very sensitive to spin and isospin\n[47\u201349]. Very roughly, the strengths of the averaged NN, \u039bN and \u03a3N potentials\nare in the following ratios: NN/\u039bN \u2243 3/2, NN/\u03a3N \u2243 3. The strong spin\u2013isospin\ndependence in the \u03a3N interaction is natural in OME models and it is due to the\nexchange of both isoscalar (\u03c9, \u03b7) and isovector mesons (\u03c0, \u03c1). The \u03a3N spin\u2013orbit\nstrength is expected to be about 0.5 \u00f7 1 times the NN one [47]. Calculations and\nexperimental observations have shown that both the \u039bN and \u03a3N effective potentials\nare strongly repulsive at short distances, and a repulsive core even remains in the \u039b\u2013\u03b1\nand \u03a30 \u2013\u03b1 folding potentials [46, 49] (which describe the \u039b and \u03a3 dynamics in 5\u039b He and\n5\n5\n\u03a3 He, respectively); however, differently from \u039b He (B\u039b \u2243 3.12 MeV), because of the\n0\nlarge repulsion in the inner region, the \u03a3 \u2013\u03b1 potential does not support bound states.\nOn the contrary, for the NN interaction the attraction at intermediate distances is\nso strong that the N\u2013\u03b1 potential obtained by the folding procedure does not contain\nthe inner repulsive component. For heavy nuclei a repulsive bump could appear on\nthe surface of the \u03a3\u2013nucleus potential because of the particular balance of repulsion\nand attraction (which is less effective on the nuclear surface) in the \u03a3N interaction\n[49].\nThe first production signals interpreted as \u03a3\u2013hypernuclear states, 20 years ago at\nCERN, showed unexpected narrow peaks (less than 8 MeV, instead of the 20 \u00f7 30\nMeV estimated for nuclear matter [47, 50]) which were assigned to the formation\n12\n16\nof 9\u03a3 Be, 12\n\u03a3 C, \u03a3 Be and \u03a3 C [51]. The first observation reported two narrow peaks\nabove the \u03a3 binding threshold separated by about 12 MeV in the 9 Be(K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 ) strong\nreaction and were ascribed to the formation of 9\u03a30 Be. However, the measurements were\ncarried out with very low statistics and the identification of the peaks involved large\nambiguities. Moreover, none of the reported states could be assigned to hypernuclear\nground states. Recently, at BNL\u2013AGS [52], by employing ten times better statistic,\nthe existence of such narrow structures for p\u2013shell hypernuclei has been excluded.\nDue to the relevance of the \u039bN\u2013\u03a3N coupling, \u03a3\u2013hypernuclei can also be regarded\nas resonant states of \u039b\u2013hypernuclei. On the other hand, in a \u03a3\u2013hypernucleus the\n\u03a3N \u2192 \u039bN conversion creates a \u039b with a kinetic energy of about 40 MeV. Since\nthe \u039b\u2013nucleus well depth is smaller than this energy, the \u039b\u2013hyperon has a thick\nprobability to escape from the nucleus and decays after \u2243 2 cm. From the theoretical\npoint of view, the existence of narrow \u03a3 state in nuclei cannot be explained only in the\n(plausible) hypothesis of a sizeable \u03a3N \u2192 \u039bN strong converting process. Among the\nmechanisms introduced in order to suppress the calculated widths of \u03a3\u2013hypernuclei\n[27, 47, 53\u201355], the most relevant ones are the Pauli blocking effect on the final nucleon\nin \u03a3N \u2192 \u039bN, the suppression of particular spin\u2013isospin transitions and the medium\npolarization effect. The latter is accounted for in [53, 54] through the so\u2013called induced\ninteraction approach. Moreover, it is also possible that the \u03a3 \u2192 \u039b conversion is less\nefficient in finite nuclei because the \u03a3\u2013nucleus potential has such a small depth that\nthe \u03a3 wave function is considerably pushed out of the nucleus. As already pointed\nout, it has been established that for s\u2013shell \u03a3\u2013hypernuclei the hyperon is pushed\ntowards the nuclear surface by a central repulsion in the \u03a3\u2013nucleus potential. The\n8\n\n\fabove effects can reduce the \u03a3N \u2192 \u039bN width up to 5\u00f710 MeV in p\u2013shell hypernuclei\n[27, 54].\nThere are many ambiguities in our knowledge of the properties of the \u03a3\u2013nucleus\npotential, as obtained from hypernuclear and \u03a3N scattering data studies. If this\npotential had small depth, in the production of heavy systems there should be the\nproblem of resolving the small spacing among the single particle levels. In fact, if\nthe energy separation among the \u03a3\u2013levels is lower than their widths, these states\ncannot be resolved by the experiment. The analysis of the few existing data on\n\u03a3\u2212 \u2013atoms and of (K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u00b1 ) production indicate [27, 47, 49, 51, 56] a \u03a3 single particle\n< 15 MeV for hypernuclei beyond the s\u2013shell.\n< |V0\u03a3 | \u223c\npotential depth in the range 8 \u223c\n\u03a3\nVery shallow depths (\u2212V0 \u2243 10 MeV) are consistent with the (K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u00b1 ) analysis,\nwhich, in fact, has not proved the existence of \u03a3 nuclear states beyond the s\u2013shell.\nInstead, \u2212V0\u03a3 \u2243 20 MeV is more consistent with \u03a3\u2013atoms data, which, however, are\nnot sensitive to the interior part of the nucleus: hence, 20 MeV overestimates |V0\u03a3 |.\nMoreover, from the above cited analysis, the \u03a3\u2013nucleus potential turns out to be\nstrongly spin\u2013 and isospin\u2013dependent, with a spin\u2013orbit part comparable with the\nN\u2013nucleus one. From further theoretical speculations [55] and experiments carried\nout in the last years at KEK [57, 58] and BNL [52, 59], the existence of \u03a3 bound states\nfor nuclear mass numbers A \u2265 4 seems to be strongly unlikely. On the other hand, the\nexistence of the predicted [60] 4\u03a3 He bound state has been proved (with binding energy\n\u2212B\u03a3 \u2243 2.8 \u00f7 4.4 MeV and width \u0393\u03a3 \u2243 7.0 \u00f7 12.1 MeV) both at KEK [57] and BNL\n[59]. Actually, only for very light systems the widths are expected to be narrower\nthan the separation among the \u03a3\u2013levels; moreover, for hypernuclei other than the\ns\u2013shell ones, the \u03a3\u2013nucleus potential could not be deep enough to accommodate \u03a3\nbound states. Other investigations support the presence of a substantial repulsive\ncomponent in the \u03a3\u2013nucleus potential also in medium and heavy hypernuclei [61]. It\nis then clear that further experiments and theoretical work are needed to properly\nunderstand the existence of \u03a3\u2013hypernuclei.\nStrangeness S = \u22122 hypernuclei and the H\u2013dibaryon\nSome experiments have revealed the existence of \u039e\u2013hypernuclei [27, 62\u201365]. They\nare produced through the K \u2212 p \u2192 K + \u039e\u2212 , K \u2212 p \u2192 K 0 \u039e0 and K \u2212 n \u2192 K 0 \u039e\u2212 strong\nreactions, which, because of the relatively large momentum transferred (\u2243 500 MeV),\npreferentially excite high total spin hypernuclear states. The measured 1s \u039e\u2212 binding\nenergies (old emulsion data) have been fitted by using a Woods\u2013Saxon potential with\n< |V0\u039e | \u223c\n< 28 MeV and surface diffuseness a = 0.65\nradius R = 1.1A1/3 fm, depth 20 \u223c\n\u039e\nfm [62]. The depth V0 compares well with theoretical predictions based on Nijmegen\nOME models and allows for the binding of several \u039e levels. More recent speculations\n12\nfavour smaller well depths, around 12 \u00f7 16 MeV [65, 66] for 12\n\u039e\u2212 C and \u039e\u2212 Be. However,\nimproved experiments are needed to extract precise information concerning the \u039e\u2013\nnucleus potential [67]; for example it is not yet clear whether the potential depth\nexhibit a mass number dependence [68]. The authors of Ref. [49] obtained a \u039e\u2212 \u2013\u03b1\npotential characterized by a quite strong inner repulsion and a shallow attraction at\nintermediate distances: the \u039e\u2212 wave function is pushed on the nuclear surface and\nthe small \u039e\u2212 binding energy has been reproduced. They have also found that in the\nformation of 5\u039e\u2212 He an important role is played by the Coulomb interaction.\n9\n\n\fWhen a \u039e\u2212 \u2013hypernucleus (or a \u039e\u2212 \u2013atom) is formed, the hyperon strongly interacts\nwith a nucleon of the medium (exchanging a strange meson, K or K \u2217 ) and produces\ntwo \u039b's with an energy release of only 28 MeV (further reduced by binding effects):\n\u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u039b. This offers the possibility of producing double\u2013\u039b\u2013hypernuclei [69, 70],\nwhich were observed for the first time during the 60's in emulsion experiments. The\nformation probability of a \u039b\u039b\u2013hypernucleus is sizeable because the 28 MeV energy\nrelease in \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u039b is only 0.1 % larger than the separation energy in an \u03b1\u2013particle.\nTherefore, if an \u03b1\u2013cluster is broken as a consequence of the \u039e\u2212 absorption, the final \u039b's\nwill not have enough energy to escape from the nucleus. The production probability\nof a double\u2013\u039b or twin\u2013\u039b hypernucleus turned out to be (18 \u00b1 13)% in the experiment\nof Ref. [71], which used \u039e\u2212 atomic capture on 12 C.\nThe strangeness S = \u22122 hypernuclei are quite interesting because they represent\nthe unique way of getting information on the \u039eN and \u039b\u039b interactions. In Ref. [62] the\nconversion width due to the process \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u039b has been estimated to be quite narrow\n(of the order of 5 MeV or less), as one expects because of the small energy released in\nthe process. More recent calculations have found conversion widths narrower than the\nspacing among the \u039e levels: typically \u0393\u039e \u2243 1.6 MeV for s\u2013states and \u0393\u039e \u2243 0.9 MeV\nfor p\u2013states [65]. For 5\u039e\u2212 He the calculation of Ref. [72] obtained a very small width,\n\u0393\u039e = 0.76 MeV, which results from a small overlap between the \u039e\u2212 wave function\nand the nuclear core (the \u039e\u2212 binding energy being only 1.7 MeV). Therefore, if the\nexperimental energy resolution is good enough, the smallness of \u0393\u039e makes it feasible\nto perform spectroscopic studies. Because of the small mass difference between initial\nand final states, the \u039b\u039b\u2013\u039eN coupling plays an important role in double \u039b hypernuclei.\nHowever, a suppression of this coupling coming from the Pauli blocking on the nucleon\nbecomes sizeable in medium\u2013heavy hypernuclei. On the contrary, the \u039b\u039b\u2013\u03a3\u03a3 strong\ncoupling will be less important for the large mass difference (\u2206m \u2243 155 MeV).\nThe study of \u039e\u2013 and \u039b\u039b\u2013hypernuclei is closely related to the observation of hyperon mixed states due to the \u039b\u039b\u2013\u039eN\u2013\u03a3\u03a3 couplings [17] and, in particular, to the\nsearch for a stable H\u2013particle. The latter is predicted to be a six quark state containing two u, two d and two s quarks coupled into a singlet SU(3) state of both\ncolour and flavour: it should have J P = 0+ , I = 0 and it should be stable against\nstrong decays (obviously, if its mass is smaller than twice the \u039b mass). This object has baryonic number 2 but it is not an ordinary nuclear state, namely the\nthree quark clusters contained in H are deconfined. This kind of di\u2013baryon was\npredicted by Jaffe in 1977 [73] within a quark bag model. Nowadays, searching experiments are running [63, 71, 74\u201377]. From observations on double\u2013\u039b\u2013hypernuclei,\n> 2m\u039b \u2212 28 MeV [10, 63, 69]. The first calthe expected mass is mH \u2261 2m\u039b + BH \u223c\nculation by Jaffe found a large value for BH (\u221280 MeV). Should the binding energy\nof the H\u2013dibaryon be more attractive than the binding energy of two \u039b's in nuclei,\nA\nBH < B\u039b\u039b \u2261 M(A+2\n\u039b\u039b Z) \u2212 M( Z) \u2212 2m\u039b , then the di\u2013baryon should be strongly emitA\nted from the nucleus (A+2\nZ + H), and the hypernucleus would have a very\n\u039b\u039b Z \u2192\nshort lifetime. On the contrary, if BH > B\u039b\u039b , successive decays of the two hyperons\n(weak processes) should be observed, but this would not necessarily imply the non\u2013\nexistence of the H di\u2013baryon: the \u039b\u039b interaction could also be attractive, although\nweaker than B\u039b\u039b . It is then clear that, in this sense, the stability of double\u2013\u039b hypernuclei may hinder the experimental detection of the H\u2013particle: the observation of\nthe weak decay of a double\u2013\u039b hypernucleus only excludes the H mass in the region\n10\n\n\fmH < 2m\u039b + B\u039b\u039b . From the present experimental searches there is no unambiguous\nevidence which supports the existence of di\u2013baryon resonances in the strange sector.\nStudies of the \u039b\u039b contribution to the experimental binding energy B\u039b\u039b are quite\ndifficult because of the few data available on double\u2013\u039b hypernuclei and of the density\ndependence of the \u039b\u039b interaction (\u039b\u039b\u2013\u039eN coupling, three body forces, etc). This\ninteraction occurs by the exchange of I = 0 mesons at lowest order, which favours an\nattractive character for V\u039b\u039b . Nuclear emulsion experiments reported the observation\n13\nof three double\u2013\u039b hypernuclei: 6\u039b\u039b He, 10\n\u039b\u039b Be and \u039b\u039b B. From these events, an effective\n\u039b\u039b matrix element \u2212hV\u039b\u039b i \u2243 \u2206B\u039b\u039b \u2261 |B\u039b\u039b | \u2212 2|B\u039b | \u2243 4 \u00f7 5 MeV [17] was determined, |B\u039b\u039b | being the separation energy of the \u039b pair from the A+2\n\u039b\u039b Z hypernucleus\nA+1\nand |B\u039b | the hyperon separation energy from the \u039b Z hypernucleus. However, a\nvery recent counter\u2013emulsion hybrid experiment, performed at KEK [78], favours a\n+0.27\nquite weaker \u039b\u039b interaction: \u2206B\u039b\u039b (6\u039b\u039b He) = 1.01\u22120.23\nMeV. The authors of Ref. [78]\nadvanced the hypothesis that in the previous emulsion experiments, the single\u2013\u039b hypernuclei were produced in excited states. In this case, a value of \u2206B\u039b\u039b around 1\nMeV is expected also from these experiments. The production of 4\u039b\u039b H hypernuclei\nhas been reported, very recently, in a counter experiment at BNL [79]. Unfortunately,\ndue to the limited statistics, the authors have not determined \u2206B\u039b\u039b . The quantity\n\u2206B\u039b\u039b , called \u039b\u039b bond energy, is expected to decrease as the nuclear mass number\nA increases and goes to zero in the limit A \u2192 \u221e: for increasing A the attraction\nbetween the \u039b's becomes weaker because of the larger \u039b\u039b average distance. We note\nhere that in Ref. [80] the author, by using the Skyrme\u2013Hartree\u2013Fock approach, found\nthe approximation \u2212hV\u039b\u039b i \u2243 \u2206B\u039b\u039b between \u039b\u039b interaction strength and bond energy to be questionable. Indeed these quantities seem to be sizeably affected by the\ninterplay of several factors, such as the spatial distributions of the \u039b's and the core\npolarization: for 13\n\u039b\u039b B the author evaluated \u2212hV\u039b\u039b i \u2243 2.1 \u00f7 5.6 MeV (depending on\nthe various parameterizations used for the \u039b\u039b Skyrme potential) once the \u039b\u039b potential was adjusted to reproduce the value \u2206B\u039b\u039b = 4.8 MeV of the old emulsion\nexperiment. In a double\u2013\u039b hypernucleus the two hyperons are in the 1 S0 relative\nstate (the 3 S0 is not allowed by Pauli principle). We can then compare the \u039b\u039b interaction matrix elements with the 1 S0 ones for \u039bn and neutron\u2013neutron interactions\nin light systems: \u2212hV\u039bn i \u2243 2 \u00f7 3 MeV, \u2212hVnn i \u2243 6 \u00f7 7 MeV. We know that the\n1\nS0 nn system is not bound. However, a 1 S0 \u039b\u039b bound system, which has a smaller\nmatrix element than nn, cannot be excluded on this basis because of the unknown\nbalance between the short range repulsion and the intermediate distance attraction\nin the \u039b\u039b interaction. On the other hand, also the \u039b\u039b\u2013\u039eN coupling must be taken\ninto account [81]. Measurements of B\u039b\u039b in medium and heavy double\u2013\u039b\u2013hypernuclei\nare expected, too.\nWe conclude this section by recalling that hypernuclei are always unstable with\nrespect to weak decay. A variety of processes are in principle accessible (which do not\nhave counterpart in the non\u2013strange sector). Limiting ourself to \u2206S = 1 transitions\nwe have:\n\u2022 for \u039b\u2013hypernuclei:\n\u039bN \u2192 nN\n\n11\n\n(Q \u2243 176 MeV);\n\n\f\u2022 for \u03a3\u2013hypernuclei:\n\u03a3N \u2192 NN\n\n(Q \u2243 255 MeV);\n\n\u039eN \u2192 \u039bN\n\u2192 \u03a3N\n\n(Q \u2243 202 MeV),\n(Q \u2243 123 MeV);\n\n\u039b\u039b \u2192 \u039bn\n\u2192 \u03a3N\n\n(Q \u2243 176 MeV),\n(Q \u2243 97 MeV);\n\n\u2022 for \u039e\u2013hypernuclei:\n\n\u2022 for \u039b\u039b\u2013hypernuclei:\n(1)\n\n\u2022 and many other processes for multi strangeness systems (S \u2264 \u22123), for example:\n\u039e\u039b \u2192 \u039eN\n\u2192 \u039b\u039b\n\u039e\u039e \u2192 \u039e\u039b\n\n(Q \u2243 174 MeV),\n(Q \u2243 199 MeV),\n(Q \u2243 199 MeV).\n\nThese decays are expected to have lifetimes of the order of 10\u221210 sec or less. However,\nwhen hyperons other than the \u039b are embedded in a nucleus, strong processes, which\nhave very short lifetimes (\u03c4 \u2243 10\u221222 \u00f7 10\u221221 sec), dominate over the quoted weak\ndecays, preventing them to occur. For double\u2013\u039b hypernuclei, the \u039b\u2013induced weak\ndecay rates [Eq. (1)] of s\u2013shell systems are estimated [82, 83] to be suppressed by\na factor 25 \u00f7 70 with respect to the free \u039b width, and are impossible to detect at\npresent.\n\n12\n\n\f2\n\nProduction of hypernuclei\n\n2.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe new development (in the last 15 years) of counter experiments have opened a new\nphase of hypernuclear physics. In fact, the old experiments in the 60's used emulsion\nand bubble chamber techniques and, practically, they only measured the hyperons\nbinding energies. Through counter techniques, the experiments have discovered new\nand interesting features of the hypernuclear structure, although several questions still\nremain unsolved.\nHypernuclei can be produced by using strong processes in which a particle (generally a pion or a kaon) hits a nucleus. Since strangeness has to be conserved, one\ncan use the following production reactions:\n1. Processes with strangeness exchange:\nK \u2212 n \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 \u2212 ,\n\u03a30 \u03c0 \u2212 ,\n\u03a3\u2212 \u03c0 0 ,\nK \u2212 p \u2192 \u03a3\u2212 \u03c0 + ,\n\u03a3+ \u03c0 \u2212 ,\n\u039b\u03c0 0 ,\n\u03a30 \u03c0 0 ;\n2. Processes with associated production of strange hadrons:\n\u03c0 + n \u2192 \u039bK + ,\n\u03a30 K + ,\n\u03a3+ K 0 ,\n+\n\u03c0 p \u2192 \u03a3+ K + ,\n\u03b3p\n\u2192 \u039bK +\n\u2212\ne p \u2192 e\u2212 \u039bK +\npN \u2192 \u039bK + N\n\n(photoproduction),\n(electroproduction),\n(proton \u2212 induced);\n\n3. Reactions in which strangeness exchange and associated production of strangeness\nare combined (used for the production of S = \u22122, \u22123 hypernuclei):\nK \u2212 p \u2192 \u039e\u2212 K + ,\n\u039e0 K 0 ,\nK + K 0 \u03a9\u2212 ,\nK \u2212 n \u2192 \u039e\u2212 K 0 ,\nK \u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u03c0 0 , followed by \u03c0 0 p \u2192 \u039bK + ,\npp\n\u2192 \u039e0 K + K + n.\nIn the following, we denote with N(a, b)Y , or simply with (a, b), the process:\naN \u2192 Y b,\n13\n\n\fFigure 4: Momentum qY transferred to the hyperon Y as a function of the projectile\nmomentum in the laboratory frame pLab for the reaction aN \u2192 Y b at \u03b8b,Lab = 0\u25e6\n(taken from Ref. [27]).\n\nwhere N is a nucleon and Y a hyperon. The considered reactions have different\ncharacteristics depending on their kinematics. In the following we shall see that, because of the complementarity of the reactions, the combined use of various production\nmodes is important for exhaustive spectroscopic studies.\nIn order to produce a hypernucleus, the hyperon emerging from the reaction has\nto remain inside the nuclear system. The formation probability of a hypernucleus\ndepends on the energy transferred in the production. When the momentum transferred to the hyperon, qY , is much larger than the nuclear Fermi momentum kF , the\nhyperon has a very small sticking probability and it leaves the nucleus. Instead, when\n< kF , the hyperon is created, with a high probability, in a bound state. In figure 4\nqY \u223c\nare shown the momenta transferred to the hyperon Y in the reactions N(a, b)Y as\na function of the projectile momentum pa at \u03b8b = 0\u25e6 in the laboratory frame. With\nthe exception of the (K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u00b1 ) reactions, the other ones reported in the figure are\nendoenergetic, therefore the hyperon cannot be produced at rest: qY decreases as the\nprojectile momentum increases but it remains finite for high pa . In this situation the\nhyperon is produced with a non\u2013negligible probability above its emission threshold,\nnamely with B\u039b > 0 (quasi\u2013free production). Some hypernuclear states in the continuum may be quasi\u2013bound state: they do not emit the hyperon but nucleons and/or\ncluster of nucleons.\n\n2.2\n\nThe (K \u2212, \u03c0 \u00b1 ) strangeness exchange reactions\n\nIn the (K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u00b1 ) production reactions the incident K \u2212 transforms the struck neutron\n(proton) into a \u039b or \u03a30 (\u03a3\u2212 ) and a \u03c0 \u2212 (\u03c0 + ) is emitted with an energy spectrum which\n14\n\n\fis directly related to the populated hypernuclear level. The reactions n(K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 )\u039b,\np(K \u2212 , \u03c0 + )\u03a3\u2212 (used for the first time at CERN [84] and BNL [30] to produce \u039b\u2013\nand \u03a3\u2013hypernuclei) are esoenergetic and can create the hyperon at rest (qY = 0).\nBy considering, as an approximation, the initial neutron in n(K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 )\u039b at rest, the\ntransferred momentum is zero, p~K = ~p\u03c0 \u2261 p~, and the pion is emitted at \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 in the\nlaboratory frame. Thus, from energy\u2013momentum conservation:\nq\np\np~ 2 + m2K + mN = m\u039b + p~ 2 + m2\u03c0 ,\nand the momentum for the production of the \u039b at rest (called magic momentum) can\nbe derived as follows:\nq\nm2 \u2212 m2\u03c0 + (m\u039b \u2212 mN )2\nEK \u2261 p~ 2 + m2K = K\n\u21d2 p \u2243 530 MeV.\n2(m\u039b \u2212 mN )\n\nIf the production reaction is p(K \u2212 , \u03c0 + )\u03a3\u2212 , the kaon magic momentum is p \u2243 280\nMeV.\nSince both the initial K \u2212 and the final pion are strongly absorbed in the nucleus\n(they have a small mean free path), the kaon induced reactions preferentially populate\nless bound \u039b\u2013levels and they have been only employed for s\u2013 and p\u2013shell hypernuclear\nstudies. Moreover, the low intensity and poor resolution of the kaon beams hinder\nthe use of the (K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u00b1 ) reactions.\nBy using the strangeness exchange reaction at \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 , the hyperon is predominantly produced in a state with the same quantum numbers of the struck nucleon,\nnamely the neutron hole and the \u039b are coupled to J P = 0+ and \u2206l = 0 (substitutional reaction). By increasing \u03b8 the relative importance of \u2206l = 1, 2, etc transitions\nincreases, and hypernuclear states with higher spin can be produced. From measures\nat both \u03b8 \u2243 0\u25e6 and \u03b8 > 10 \u00f7 15\u25e6 it has been possible to study a large part of the level\nstructure of light hypernuclei [30, 33].\n16\nSpectroscopic studies with the reaction n(K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 )\u039b in a few hypernuclei (13\n\u039b C, \u039b O\nand others) have shown that the spin\u2013orbit part of the \u039b\u2013nucleus mean potential is\nvery small compared to the one of a nucleon [28\u201330], although the exact magnitude\nis not known yet. Taken, for instance, the case of 16\n\u039b O, the measured \u039b and nucleon\np1/2 \u2212 p3/2 spin\u2013orbit shifts are [28]:\n16\n\u2206E\u039b (16\n\u039b O; 1p1/2 \u2212 1p3/2 ) \u2264 0.3 MeV \u226a \u2206EN (\u039b O; 1p1/2 \u2212 1p3/2 ) \u2243 6 MeV.\n\nThis estimate comes from the observed peaks in the excitation spectrum, which are\nreported in table 1 with the relative (N \u22121 , \u039b) configurations. We see that the p1/2 \u2212\np3/2 spin\u2013orbit separation for the nucleon is obtained by subtracting the energies of\npeaks #3 and #4. From the observation that almost the same separation exists\nbetween the peaks #1 and #2, we can infer that the analogous spin\u2013orbit separation\nfor the \u039b is compatible with zero. Subsequent (\u03c0 + , K + ) experiments have confirmed\nsmall \u039b spin\u2013orbit splittings. Very recently, the hyperon 1p1/2 \u2212 1p3/2 splitting of 13\n\u039bC\n13\n\u2212\n\u2212 13\nhypernuclei, produced by the C(K , \u03c0 )\u039b C reaction, has been measured at BNL\n[85], with the result:\n\u2206E\u039b (13\n\u039b C; 1p1/2 \u2212 1p3/2 )\n\n= 0.152 \u00b1 0.065 MeV\n<< \u2206EN (13\n\u039b C; 1p1/2 \u2212 1p3/2 ) \u2243 3 \u00f7 5 MeV.\n15\n\n\fTable 1: Peaks observed at CERN in\nPeak\n#1\n#2\n#3\n#4\n\nB\u039b (MeV)\n3.5\n-2.5\n-7\n-13\n\n16\n\u039bO\n\nproduction (taken from Ref.

[86] of old emulsion data\n16\non 16\n\u039b O found larger effects: \u2206E\u039b (\u039b O; 1p1/2 \u2212 1p3/2 ) = 1.30 \u00f7 1.45 MeV. On the\nother hand, the smallness of the \u039b\u2013nucleus spin\u2013orbit interaction arises naturally\nin a relativistic mean field description [31]. The \u039b p1/2 \u2212 p3/2 splitting is generally\nconsidered to be originated predominantly from the \u039bN spin\u2013orbit force acting on the\n\u039b in the p1/2 and p3/2 levels of the \u039b\u221215 O system. However, excitations of the core may\ncontribute to the spin\u2013orbit splitting as well [32, 34], especially in heavy hypernuclei\n[35, 87]. Hence, the smallness of the \u039b spin\u2013orbit splittings does not necessarily imply\na weak \u039bN spin\u2013orbit interaction1 : we also have to take into account the response\nof the nucleons' core to the added \u039b, which can modify the mentioned shifts itself.\nIndeed, there is evidence [34] that the core response is able to reduce significantly\nthe \u039b spin\u2013orbit splitting, already in 13\n\u039b C. Hypernuclear structure calculations with\ncore\u2013excited states [21, 24] will be important in future analysis.\nIn the last 15 years the strangeness exchange reaction has been used at BNL\n[89, 90] for production and decay studies of hypernuclei from 4\u039b H to 12\n\u039b C. However,\nbecause of the small momentum transfer and the large background coming from the\nin\u2013flight kaon decays, the measurement could not be extended to heavy hypernuclei.\nAt BNL [52, 59] and KEK [57, 58], the (K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 ) reaction confirmed the existence of\nthe 4\u03a3 He bound state, which was under discussion for about ten years.\nThe (stopped K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 ) reaction has been used at KEK [46, 91, 92], and, in the near\nfuture, will be employed at Da\u03a6ne [93], the Frascati \u03c6\u2013factory. Moreover, this process\nwas the standard method to produce \u039b\u2013hypernuclei in emulsion and bubble chamber\nexperiments during the 60's. When the K \u2212 is stopped in the target, it is captured\ninto an atomic level and then, after cascade down to inner levels, it is absorbed in the\nnuclear surface, converting a nucleon into a \u039b or \u03a3. The momentum transferred to the\nproduced \u039b is close to kF (for 0\u25e6 scattering\u2013angle, q\u039b \u2243 250 MeV), while when a \u03a3 is\nproduced, q\u03a3 \u2243 180 MeV. The process with absorption of a kaon at rest in nuclei has\nthe good feature of a large production yields, especially for \u03a3\u2013hypernuclei [91], and a\nlarge number of hypernuclear states is accessible. Moreover, differently from the in\u2013\nflight reaction, it allows a clean separation of the quasi\u2013free hypernuclear production\n(because of the larger transferred momentum), resulting in a better determination of\nthe weak decay rates, especially in light systems [46].\nl\u2212s\nYet, we know that it is smaller than the N N spin\u2013orbit force, with a ratio VNl\u2212s\nN /V\u039bN \u2243 3 \u00f7 10\nbetween the strengths expected from phenomenological studies of the baryon\u2013baryon potentials [5,\n7, 11]. Very recent results from hypernuclear high\u2013precision \u03b3\u2013ray spectroscopy experiments [22, 88]\nl\u2212s\nseem to suggest an even smaller \u039bN spin\u2013orbit interaction: VNl\u2212s\nN /V\u039bN >> 10 [23].\n1\n\n16\n\n\fAt KEK [94], the mesonic decay widths (\u039b \u2192 \u03c0N) for 4\u039b H and 4\u039b He, produced by\nthe in\u2013flight reaction, have been measured quite accurately. The \u039b decay into \u03c0 0 n\nhas been directly identified for the first time in 4\u039b He. Similarly, a measurement of\n12\nthe \u03c0 0 n decay channel for 11\n\u039b B and \u039b C is presented in Ref. [92]. Observations of this\nkind are of great importance also in connection with a proper parameterization of the\n\u03c0 0 \u2013nucleus optical potential.\n\n2.3\n\nThe n(\u03c0 + , K +)\u039b strangeness associated production reaction\n\nWhen a \u03c0 + hits a neutron, by the creation of a ss quark pair one has the associated production of two strange hadrons in the final state: the s\u2013quark becomes a\nconstituent of a \u039b and the s is transferred to the meson, which becomes a K + . The\nn(\u03c0 + , K + )\u039b reaction is complementary to the n(K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 )\u039b one. In fact, differently\nfrom the latter, the former is best suited for studying deeply bound states in medium\nand heavy hypernuclei [37, 38]. It allows almost background free spectra and it has\nthe advantages of using good quality and large intensity pion beams. In addition, the\nfinal K + is moderately distorted by the nucleus (\u03bbK + \u2243 2\u03bbK \u2212 \u2243 2\u03bb\u03c0\u00b1 \u2243 4 fm). The\nreaction n(\u03c0 + , K + )\u039b thus preferentially populates bound states with high (n\u22121 , \u039b)\nspin configurations. Since the mass of the final strange hadrons pair is sizeably larger\nthat the mass of the initial particles, the n(\u03c0 + , K + )\u039b reaction is endothermic, with\na quite large momentum transferred to the hyperon: qY \u2243 300 \u00f7 400 MeV at 0\u25e6\nscattering\u2013angle (see figure 4). Hence, this reaction is able to populate all possible \u039b\nlevels, from the deepest one up to the quasi\u2013free region. We note that when the \u039b is\nproduced above its emission threshold, namely in the quasi\u2013free region, it may leave\nthe nucleus or spread its energy inside the nucleus. In the latter case, by the emission\nof nucleons and/or photons, a variety of hypernuclear states are accessible. Because\nof the relatively large momenta transferred to the hyperon, the relevant cross section\nfor the associated production reaction is one/two orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe one typical of the strangeness exchange reaction. However, this defect is overcompensated by the high intensity of the available pion beams. From experiments\nusing this reaction we have high quality information about the spectroscopy of many\nlight to heavy \u039b\u2013hypernuclei [35\u201338, 95].\nThe associated production reaction has been used for the first time at BNL [96,\n97] for 12\n\u039b C, while more recently it has been employed at KEK [35, 38, 98]. Here,\nit allowed to accurately measure the lifetime of \u039b\u2013hypernuclei over a broad range\n56\n89\nof mass numbers [99] (from 12\n\u039b C to \u039b Fe, and data on \u039b Y are under analysis now),\nwith the explicit identification of the produced hypernuclei. Moreover, (\u03c0 + , K + )\nspectroscopy experiments at KEK [35, 100] observed double\u2013peak structures in 12\n\u039b C,\n16\n51\n89\n\u039b O, \u039b V and \u039b Y, interpretable as \u039b spin\u2013orbit splittings. The magnitude of the\nshifts suggests a \u039b\u2013nucleus spin\u2013orbit interaction stronger than the one extracted\nfrom (K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 ) experiments. However, the interpretation of the measured spectra is\nstill under discussion.\nAt KEK [101] the n(\u03c0 + , K + )\u039b reaction has been also utilized to measure the\nweak decay width for \u039b \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 p in 12\n\u039b C. This measurement has been carried out with\na relatively small error and allowed a quite precise determination of the medium\n\n17\n\n\fdistortion acting on the pion coming out from the decay, a useful point for a better\nunderstanding of the pion\u2013nucleus interactions.\nThe KEK Superconducting Kaon Spectrometer worked with an energetic resolution of 1.5 \u00f7 2 MeV FWHM2 . Nowadays, there is an effort for sub\u2013MeV resolution\nspectroscopy (and pion beams with high statistics and intensity), again by using\nthe (\u03c0 + , K + ) reaction, at the Japan Hadron Facility (JHF) [102]. The use of high\nresolutions is important, in particular, for the observation of the hypernuclear fine\u2013\nstructure and, in turn, for a better understanding of the \u039bN spin\u2013isospin dependent\ninteractions.\n\n2.4\n\nThe p(e, e\u2032, K +)\u039b reaction\n\nThe electroproduction reaction is characterized by large momentum transfer (\u2243 350\nMeV) and by the dominance of the spin\u2013flip amplitudes in the elementary process\np(\u03b3, K + )\u039b. Thus, the electroproduction cross sections are small and the reaction\nmainly populates stretched and unnatural parity hypernuclear states. The smallness\nof the (e, e\u2032 , K + ) reaction cross section is partially compensated by the high intensity\nof the initial electron beam relatively to that of the final kaon beam. This reaction\ncould complement our knowledge of hypernuclear spectroscopy derived from studies performed with meson beams. Indeed, the high precision of electron beams can\nconsiderably improve the quality of experimental data. Moreover, the (K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u00b1 ) and\n(\u03c0 + , K + ) reactions hardly produce ground states and deep\u2013hole states in heavy hypernuclei, because of the strong pion and kaon absorption in the nuclear medium.\nUnnatural parity states are also difficult to excite in (K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u00b1 ) and (\u03c0 + , K + ) experiments, due to their moderate spin\u2013flip amplitudes.\nAt TJNAF laboratories [103], by using the electroproduction reaction, hypernuclear levels will be observed with high\u2013resolution (\u2243 0.6 MeV FWHM) and, through\nfission fragment detection techniques, the lifetimes of heavy hypernuclei will be measured with great accuracy and precise identification of the decayed system [104].\n\n2\n\nFull Width at Half Maximum\n\n18\n\n\f3\n3.1\n\nWeak decay modes of \u039b\u2013hypernuclei\nIntroduction\n\nIn the production of hypernuclei, the populated state may be highly excited, above one\nor more threshold energies for particle decays. These states are unstable with respect\nto the emission of the hyperon, of photons and nucleons. The spectroscopic studies\nof strong and electromagnetic de\u2013excitations give information on the hypernuclear\nstructure which are complementary to those we can extract from excitation functions\nand angular distributions studies. Once the hypernucleus is stable with respect to\nelectromagnetic and strong processes, it is in the ground state, with the hyperon in the\n1s level, and can only decay via a strangeness\u2013changing weak interaction, through the\ndisappearance of the hyperon. This is the most important decay mechanism, because\nit opens the possibility to study some very interesting questions, which have been\nquoted in the introduction of section 1.\nNow we come to the main subject of the review, the study of the weak decay of \u039b\u2013\nhypernuclei. In the next two subsections we briefly discuss the main characteristics\nof the decay channels for these systems. In subsection 3.2 we will introduce the\nmesonic mode (\u039b \u2192 \u03c0N), which resembles what happens to the \u039b in free space, and\nin subsection 3.3 the so\u2013called non\u2013mesonic modes (\u039bN \u2192 NN, \u039bNN \u2192 NNN,\netc), which can only occur in nuclear systems.

Actually, this rule is slightly violated in the \u039b free\nfree\ndecay, since it predicts \u0393free\n\u03c0 \u2212 /\u0393\u03c0 0 = 2 (taking the same phase space for the two channels and neglecting the final state interactions). Nevertheless, the ratio A1/2 /A3/2\nbetween the \u2206I = 1/2 and the \u2206I = 3/2 transition amplitudes is very large (of the\norder of 30). This isospin rule is based on experimental observations but its dynamical origin is not yet understood on theoretical grounds. On the other hand, it is\n\n19\n\n\fnot clear whether it is a universal characteristic of all non\u2013leptonic processes with\n\u2206S 6= 0. The \u039b free decay in the Standard Model can occur through both \u2206I = 1/2\nand \u2206I = 3/2 transitions, with comparable strengths: an s quark converts into a\nu quark through the exchange of a W boson. Moreover, the effective 4\u2013quark weak\ninteraction derived from the Standard Model including perturbative QCD corrections\n(box and penguin quark diagrams, namely one\u2013loop gluon radiative corrections) gives\ntoo small A1/2 /A3/2 ratios (\u2243 3\u00f74, as calculated at the hadronic scale of about 1 GeV\nby using renormalization group techniques [105, 106]). Therefore, non\u2013perturbative\nQCD effects at low energy (such as hadron structure and reaction mechanism), which\nare more difficult to handle, and/or final state interactions could be responsible for\nthe enhancement of the \u2206I = 1/2 amplitude and/or the suppression of the \u2206I = 3/2\namplitude. In the low energy regime, chiral perturbation theory is the effective theory\nwhich is usually employed for describing hadronic phenomena [107]. However, it is\nwell known that, when used in connection with perturbative QCD corrections, it is\nnot able to reproduce the rates for hyperon non\u2013leptonic weak decays.\nTaking\npenergy\u2013momentum conservation in the mesonic decay, m\u039b is\npinto account\nequal to p~ 2 + m2\u03c0 + p~ 2 + m2N in the center\u2013of\u2013mass system, thus the momentum\nof the final nucleon is p \u2243 100 MeV and corresponds to an energy release Q\u039b \u2243\nm\u039b \u2212mN \u2212m\u03c0 \u2243 40 MeV. We have neglected the binding energies of the recoil nucleon\nand \u039b, which tend to decrease p. Hence, in nuclei the mesonic decay is disfavoured by\nthe Pauli principle, particularly in heavy systems. It is strictly forbidden in normal\ninfinite nuclear matter (where the Fermi momentum is kF0 \u2243 270 MeV), while in finite\nnuclei it can occur because of three important effects:\n\u2022 In nuclei the hyperon has a momentum distribution (being confined in a limited\nspatial region) that allows larger momenta to be available to the final nucleon;\n\u2022 The final pion feels an attraction by the medium, such that\np for fixed momentum\n~q it has an energy smaller than the free one [\u03c9(~q) < ~q 2 + m2\u03c0 ], and consequently, due to energy conservation, the final nucleon again has more chance to\ncome out above the Fermi surface. It has been shown [108, 109] that the pion\ndistortion increases the mesonic width by one or two orders of magnitude for\nvery heavy hypernuclei (A \u2243 200) with respect to the value obtained without\nthe medium distortion. For light and medium hypernuclei this enhancement\nfactor is smaller, being about 2 for A \u2243 16.\n\u2022 At the nuclear surface the local Fermi momentum is considerably smaller than\nkF0 (namely the Pauli blocking is less effective) and favours the decay.\nNevertheless, the mesonic width rapidly decreases as the nuclear mass number A of\nthe hypernucleus increases [108, 109]. A further (but very small) effect which reduces\nthe mesonic rate, especially in medium and heavy hypernuclei, is the absorption of the\nfinal pion in the medium. Actually, while energy\u2013momentum conservation forbids the\nabsorption of a on\u2013shell pion by a free nucleon, the absorption by a correlated pair of\nnucleons is allowed for both on\u2013 and off\u2013shell pions, and the corresponding \u039b decay is\nobserved as non\u2013mesonic, resulting in a final state with 3 nucleons: \u039bNN \u2192 NNN.\nHence, the mesonic channel is strictly related to the three\u2013body non\u2013mesonic decay.\n20\n\n\fFrom the study of the mesonic channel it is possible to extract important information on the pion\u2013nucleus optical potential, which we do not know nowadays in a\ncomplete and unequivocal form from pionic atoms and low energy pion\u2013nucleus scattering experiments (on the other hand, no data are available for neutral pions). The\nnuclear mesonic rate, \u0393M = \u0393\u03c0\u2212 + \u0393\u03c00 , is very sensitive to the pion self\u2013energy in the\nmedium [108\u2013110]: it is significantly enhanced by the attractive P \u2013wave part of the\noptical potential, but exclusive decays to closed shell nuclei mainly select the repulsive P \u2013wave interaction and reduce the mesonic rate with respect to the calculation\nusing non\u2013distorted (free) pion waves.\nThe mesonic width is also extremely sensitive to the Q\u2013value of the process,\nQ\u039b \u2243 40 MeV +B\u039b \u2212 BN , which is in fact very small and decreases with the nuclear\nmass number. This implies a great sensitivity of the available phase space to the mass\nof the final light particle, i.e. the pion (in analogy with the problem of determining\nthe neutrino mass from the nuclear \u03b2 decay), and to the \u039b and final nucleon binding\nenergies. It is then clear that a systematic measurement of the mesonic decays in\nmedium\u2013heavy systems is strongly advisable. Unfortunately, no data are nowadays\navailable on the mesonic decay for A \u2265 56 hypernuclei, apart from some old emulsion\nand bubble chamber limits for 40 < A < 100 [111].\nFrom calculations and experiments on mesonic decays of s\u2013shell hypernuclei we\nhave evidence for a central repulsion in the \u039b\u2013nucleus mean potential [46, 49, 112]\n(named, for this reason, \"Isle\" potential). This is an indication for a particular balance\nbetween the strongly repulsive \u039bN interaction at short range, which automatically\nappears in quark based models [10, 45], and the weak (with respect to the NN one)\n\u039bN attraction at intermediate distances.\nThe following consideration about the Pauli principle in very light systems is interesting. We have discussed how the Pauli exclusion principle suppresses the nuclear\nmesonic decay. However, in A = 3 hypernuclei the mesonic decays into two\u2013body\nfinal states are enhanced (with respect to the corresponding free \u039b decays) as a result\nof the anti\u2013symmetrization of the nucleons in the particular final states [112, 113]. For\nexample, the experimental rate for the two\u2013body process 4\u039b H\u21924 He+\u03c0 \u2212 (\u2243 0.69 \u0393free\n\u039b )\n\u2212\nfree\nis almost equal to the \u039b \u2192 \u03c0 p free rate (\u2243 0.64 \u0393\u039b ). Adding also the contribution of three\u2013body mesonic decays with a \u03c0 \u2212 in the final state, the rate is about\nthe total \u039b free width: \u0393(4\u039b H \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 + all) > \u0393free\n\u03c0 \u2212 . Moreover, again from data,\n4\n0\nfree\n>\n\u0393(\u039b He\u2192 \u03c0 + all) \u223c \u0393\u03c00 .\nFrom theoretical calculations [108, 109] and experimental measurements [114] there\nis evidence that the \u0393\u03c0\u2212 /\u0393\u03c00 ratio in nuclei strongly oscillates around the value 2,\npredicted by the \u2206I = 1/2 rule for a nucleus with an equal number of neutrons and\nprotons and closed shells. However, this is essentially due to nuclear shell effects\nand might not be directly related to the weak process itself. On the other hand,\nin the calculation of Refs. [108, 109] the \u2206I = 1/2 rule is enforced in the \u039b \u2192 \u03c0N\nfree vertex; however, shell effects, also related to the Pauli blocking for the available\nfinal nuclear states, make \u0393\u03c0\u2212 /\u0393\u03c00 strongly dependent on the hypernuclear structure.\nWe remind the reader that \u0393\u03c0\u2212 /\u0393\u03c00 is also sensitive to final state interactions and\nCoulomb effects.\n\n21\n\n\fN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\n\u03c0, \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03b7, \u039a, \u039a *\n\u03c0, \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03b7, \u039a, \u039a *\n\n\u039b\n\n\u039b\n\nN\n\nFigure 5: One\u2013nucleon (a) and two\u2013nucleon (b) induced \u039b decay in nuclei.\n\n3.3\n\nNon\u2013mesonic decay\n\nWhen the pion emitted from the weak hadronic vertex \u039b \u2192 \u03c0N is virtual, then it\nwill be absorbed by one or more nucleons of the medium, resulting in a non\u2013mesonic\nprocess of the following type:\n\u039bn \u2192 nn (\u0393n ) ,\n\u039bp \u2192 np (\u0393p ) ,\n\u039bNN \u2192 nNN (\u03932 ) .\n\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nThe total weak decay rate of a \u039b\u2013hypernucleus is then:\n\u0393T = \u0393M + \u0393NM ,\nwhere:\n\u0393M = \u0393\u03c0 \u2212 + \u0393\u03c0 0 ,\n\n\u0393NM = \u03931 + \u03932 ,\n\n\u03931 = \u0393n + \u0393p ,\n\nand the lifetime is \u03c4 = ~/\u0393T . The channel (4) can be interpreted by assuming\nthat the pion is absorbed by a pair of nucleons correlated by the strong interaction.\nObviously, the non\u2013mesonic processes can also be mediated by the exchange of more\nmassive mesons than the pion (see figure 5).\nThe non\u2013mesonic mode is only possible in nuclei and, nowadays, the systematic\nstudy of the hypernuclear decay is the only practical way to get information on the\nweak process \u039bN \u2192 NN (which provides the first extension of the weak \u2206S = 0\nNN \u2192 NN interaction to strange baryons), especially on its parity\u2013conserving part,\nwhich is masked by the strong interaction in the weak NN \u2192 NN reaction. In\nfact, there are not experimental observations for the process \u039bN \u2192 NN using \u039b\nbeams: it is, however, under study (at COSY [2] and KEK [3]) the measurement\nof the (low) cross section for the inverse reaction pn \u2192 p\u039b, which could give much\ncleaner information.\n22\n\n\fThe precise measurement of \u0393n and \u0393p in s\u2013shell hypernuclei is very important\nfor the study of the spin\u2013isospin dependence and of the validity of the \u2206I = 1/2 rule\nin the non\u2013mesonic processes (see the analysis presented in subsection 6.3); on the\nother side, it is relevant in connection with the hypernuclear structure dependence,\nwhich is rather important in these very light systems. In s\u2013shell hypernuclei all\nnucleons are confined (as the hyperon) into the s\u2013level, while complications arise\nwith increasing mass number, due to the appearance of more initial \u039bN states and of\nthe nucleons' rescattering inside the residual nucleus, which entangles the kinematics\nof the measured nucleons.\nThe final nucleons in the non\u2013mesonic processes emerge with large momenta:\ndisregarding the \u039b and nucleon binding energies and assuming the available energy\nQ = m\u039b \u2212 mN \u2243 176 MeV to be equally splitted among the final nucleons, it turns\nout that pN \u2243 420 MeV for the one\u2013nucleon induced channels [Eqs. (2), (3)] and\npN \u2243 340 MeV in the case of the two\u2013nucleon induced mechanism (4). Therefore, the\nnon\u2013mesonic decay mode is not forbidden by the Pauli principle: on the contrary, the\nfinal nucleons escape from the nucleus with great probability and the non\u2013mesonic\nmechanism dominates over the mesonic mode for all but the s\u2013shell hypernuclei.\nFor very light systems the two decay modes are competitive, the smallest value for\nthe non\u2013mesonic width corresponding to hypertriton, where it is evaluated to be\n1.7% of the \u039b free decay rate [115]. The non\u2013mesonic channel is characterized by\nlarge momentum transfer, thus, apart from very light hypernuclei, the details of the\nhypernuclear structure do not have a substantial influence (then providing useful\ninformation directly on the hadronic weak interaction). On the other hand, the NN\nand \u039bN short range correlations turn out to be very important.\nThere is an anticorrelation between mesonic and non\u2013mesonic decay modes such\nthat the experimental lifetime is quite stable from light to heavy hypernuclei [111,\n114], apart from some fluctuation in light systems because of shell structure effects:\n\u03c4\u039b = (0.5 \u00f7 1) \u03c4\u039bfree . Since the mesonic width is less than 1% of the total width for\nA > 100, the above consideration implies that the non\u2013mesonic rate is rather constant\nin the region of heavy hypernuclei. This can be simply understood from the following\nconsideration. If one naively assumes a zero range approximation for the non\u2013mesonic\nprocess \u039bN \u2192 NN (actually, the range is not zero, but very small, due to the large\ntransferred momenta), \u03931 is proportional to the overlap between the \u039b and nuclear\ndensities:\nZ\n\u03931 (A) \u221d d~r |\u03c8\u039b (~r)|2 \u03c1A (~r),\nwhere the \u039b wave function \u03c8\u039b (nuclear density \u03c1A ) is normalized to unity (to the\nnuclear mass number A). This overlap integral increases with the mass number and\nreaches a constant value: by using, for simplicity, \u039b harmonic oscillator wave functions\n(with frequency \u03c9 adjusted to the experimental hyperon levels in hypernuclei) and\n208\nFermi distributions for the nuclear densities, we find \u03931 (12\n\u039b C)/\u03931 (\u039b Pb) \u2243 0.56, while\n\u03931 is 90 % of the saturation value for A \u2243 65. In figure 6 the qualitative behaviour\nof mesonic, non\u2013mesonic and total widths as a function of the nuclear mass number\nA is shown. For A \u2264 11 the experimental data are quite well fitted by \u0393NM /\u0393free\n\u039b \u2243\n0.1A: \u03931 (namely the probability of the \u039bN \u2192 NN process) is proportional to the\nnumber of \u039bN pairs, A, as it is expected from the above simple description, where we\n23\n\n\fFigure 6: Qualitative behaviour of mesonic, non\u2013mesonic and total decay widths as\na function of the baryonic number A + 1.\n\nneglect the contribution of \u03932 . Actually, the observed saturation of the \u039bN \u2192 NN\ninteraction is strictly related to its range: the saturation occurs when the radius of\nthe hypernucleus becomes sensitively larger than the range of the interaction. By\ninspecting the experimental data of Refs. [42, 90, 98, 99] we can conclude that the\ndecaying \u039b can interact at most with about 15 \u00f7 20 neighbouring nucleons, namely\nalmost exclusively with s\u2013 and p\u2013shell nucleons. However, for a more quantitative\nexplanation it will be important to collect data (with good precision, like in the KEK\nexperiment [99] or in the planned FINUDA [93]) for hypernuclei between 12\n\u039b C and\n28\nSi\nand\nin\nthe\nregion\nA\n=\n100\n\u00f7\n200.\nYet,\nfrom\nthe\navailable\ndata\none\ncan\nsay,\n\u039b\nvery roughly, that the long distance component of the \u039bN \u2192 NN interaction has a\nrange of about 1.5 fm and corresponds, as we expect, to the OPE component of the\ninteraction.\n3.3.1\n\nThe \u0393n /\u0393p puzzle\n\nNowadays, the main problem concerning the weak decay rates is to reproduce the\nexperimental value for the ratio \u0393n /\u0393p between the neutron\u2013 and the proton\u2013induced\nwidths \u039bn \u2192 nn and \u039bp \u2192 np. The theoretical calculations underestimate the\ncentral data for all considered hypernuclei (see tables 7\u20139):\n\u001a \u001bExp\n\u001a \u001bTh\n\u001a \u001bExp\n\u0393n\n\u0393n\n\u0393n\n<2\n<\n\u226a\n, 0.5 \u223c\n\u223c\n\u0393p\n\u0393p\n\u0393p\n(only for 4\u039b He this ratio seems to be less than 0.5), although the large experimental\nerror bars do not allow to reach any definitive conclusion. The data are quite limited\nand not precise because of the difficulty in detecting the products of the non\u2013mesonic\ndecays, especially for the neutron\u2013induced one. Moreover, the present experimental\n24\n\n\fenergy resolution for the detection of the outgoing nucleons do not allow to identify\nA\u22122\nthe final state of the residual nuclei in the processes A\nZ + nn and A\n\u039bZ \u2192\n\u039bZ \u2192\nA\u22122\n(Z \u2212 1) + np. As a consequence, the measurements supply decay rates averaged\nover several nuclear final states.\nIn the one\u2013pion\u2013exchange approximation, by assuming the \u2206I = 1/2 rule in the\n\u039b \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 p and \u039b \u2192 \u03c0 0 n free couplings, the calculations (discussed in the next section)\ngive small ratios, in the range 0.05\u00f70.20.\nThis is due to the \u2206I = 1/2 rule, which fixes\n\u221a\nthe vertex ratio V\u039b\u03c0\u2212 p /V\u039b\u03c00 n = \u2212 2 (both in S\u2013 and P \u2013wave interactions), and to the\nparticular form of the OPE potential, which has a strong tensor and weak central and\nparity\u2013violating forces: the large tensor transition \u039bN(3 S1 ) \u2192 NN(3 D1 ) requires,\nin fact, I = 0 np pairs in the anti\u2013symmetric final state. In p\u2013shell and heavier\nhypernuclei the relative \u039bN L = 1 state is found to give only a small contribution\nto tensor transitions for the neutron\u2013induced decay, so it cannot improve the OPE\nratio. The contribution of the \u039bN L = 1 relative state to \u0393NM seems to be of\nabout 5 \u00f7 15% in p\u2013shell hypernuclei [116\u2013118]. For these systems we expect the\ndominance of the S\u2013wave interaction in the initial state, due to the small \u039bN relative\nmomentum. By using a simple argument about the isospin structure of the transition\n\u039bN \u2192 NN in OPE,\n\u221a it is possible to estimate that for pure \u2206I = 3/2 transitions\n\u2212\n0\n(V\u039b\u03c0 p /V\u039b\u03c0 n = 1/ 2) the OPE ratio can increase up to about 0.5. However, the\nOPE model with \u2206I = 1/2 couplings has been able to reproduce the one\u2013body\nstimulated non\u2013mesonic rates \u03931 = \u0393n + \u0393p for light and medium hypernuclei [117\u2013\n121]. Hence, the problem seems to consist in overestimating the proton\u2013induced rate\nand underestimating the neutron\u2013induced one.\nIn order to solve this puzzle (namely to explain both \u0393n + \u0393p and \u0393n /\u0393p ), many\nattempts have been made up to now, but without success. We recall the inclusion in\nthe \u039bN \u2192 NN transition potential of mesons heavier than the pion (also including\nthe exchange of correlated or uncorrelated two\u2013pions) [117\u2013120, 122\u2013125], the inclusion of interaction terms that explicitly violate the \u2206I = 1/2 rule [126\u2013128] and the\ndescription of the short range baryon\u2013baryon interaction in terms of quark degrees\nof freedom (by using a hybrid quark model in [129] and a direct quark mechanism in\n[121, 130, 131]), which automatically introduces \u2206I = 3/2 contributions. The calculations of Refs. [117, 118, 125, 131, 132] are the only ones which have found a sizeable\nincrease of the neutron to proton ratio with respect to the OPE value. We shall come\nback to the problem of the \u0393n /\u0393p ratio more extensively in subsection 4.2 and section\n6.\n\n25\n\n\f4\n\nPresent status of experiment and theory\n\n4.1\n\nExperiment\n\nWe shortly summarize here the main experiments which have observed the weak decay\nof \u039b\u2013hypernuclei.\nThe decay of a hypernucleus was observed for the first time in 1952 [1] in a\nnuclear emulsion used for cosmic\u2013ray observations. The experiments on the weak\ndecays started in the first 60's and employed negative kaons stopped in emulsions\nand bubble chambers [133]. They were mostly based on the detection of the emitted\nnegative pions, and only established rough limits on the total lifetimes of s\u2013shell\n\u039b\u2013hypernuclei.\nIn the following years [134], until the first 70's, although with great difficulties\n(the identification of hypernuclei was hard, statistics and precision were very low,\netc), the experiments succeeded in separating the mesonic and non\u2013mesonic \u039b decays\nand established the first limits on the partial rates. In these experiments hypernuclei\nwere produced by using kaon or pion beams, as explained in section 2. They showed\n[90, 111, 135] that:\n\u2022 for s\u2013shell hypernuclei the mesonic and non\u2013mesonic widths were comparable,\n< \u0393n /\u0393p \u223c\n< 2;\n\u0393NM /\u0393\u03c0\u2212 \u2243 0.3 \u00f7 1.5, and 0.3 \u223c\n< \u0393n /\u0393p \u223c\n< 2;\n\u2022 for p\u2013shell hypernuclei: \u0393NM /\u0393\u03c0\u2212 \u2243 2 \u00f7 7 and 0.6 \u223c\n\u2022 for medium and heavy hypernuclei (40 < A < 100) the non\u2013mesonic processes\n< 9;\n< \u0393n /\u0393p \u223c\nwere dominant, \u0393NM /\u0393\u03c0\u2212 \u2243 100 \u00f7 200, and 1.5 \u223c\n\u2022 the total lifetimes for light hypernuclei (A \u2264 15) oscillated in the interval\n\u03c4 /\u03c4\u039bfree \u2243 0.3 \u00f7 1.\nThe interest in the detection of hypernuclear decays seems out of stock in the first\n70's, until the first half of the 80's [30, 96], when at the Brookhaven synchrotron, by\nusing modern techniques (scintillators, proportional chambers, etc, which allow direct\n12\ntiming observations), it was measured the lifetime of 11\n\u039b B and \u039b C [89], produced by the\n(K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 ) reaction. After some years, through the detection of protons, neutrons (from\nnon\u2013mesonic decays) and negative pions (from mesonic decays), the partial rates for\n5\n12\n\u039b He and \u039b C have been measured [90]. The total lifetime was measured directly, and\nthe mesonic rate into \u03c0 0 n obtained by subtraction: \u0393\u03c00 = \u0393T \u2212\u0393n \u2212\u0393p \u2212\u0393\u03c0\u2212 . It must\nbe noted that lifetime measurements are free from nuclear final state interactions and\nmaterial effects, which, on the contrary, affects very much the measurement of the\npartial rates \u0393n and \u0393p . The so\u2013called \"modern era\" of hypernuclear physics starts\nwith counter experiment like these, which very much improved the quality of data.\nMore recently, with the same techniques, 4\u039b He and 9\u039b Be hypernuclei have been studied\nat BNL [136].\n238\nIn the middle of the 80's, at CERN LEAR, the lifetimes of 209\n\u039b Bi and \u039b U (produced by anti\u2013proton annihilation) were measured [137], although with very large\n26\n\n\ferror bars, with results comparable with the lifetimes of light hypernuclei. More recent results, obtained with an improved apparatus, are published in Ref. [41]: large\nuncertainties remain because of the limited precision of the recoil shadow method.\nThe experiment measures the fission fragments of the produced hypernucleus, with a\ndelay time which is equal to the hypernuclear lifetime. In fact, the fission events are\nmainly induced by the energy released in the non\u2013mesonic decay (the probability of\na time delayed fission due to the \u039b decay is more than up to 2 orders of magnitude\nhigher than the one of prompt fission due to other sources [41]). Experiments of\nthis kind are very difficult to perform (the produced hypernucleus cannot be unambiguously identified) and, as already mentioned, the lifetimes are generally measured\nwith large errors. Only very recently [42, 138, 139], more accurate results have been\nobtained from delayed fission experiments. Nevertheless, there is a certain disagreement among these new data, and the saturation value of the lifetime for very heavy\nhypernuclei is not established with precision. It is important to remind the reader\nthat, for the decay of very heavy hypernuclei, the application of more accurate techniques, employing direct timing methods (used, for instance, in the BNL experiment\nof Ref. [90]), is practically impossible due to the large background of light particles.\nIn the last 15 years there has been a rapid development of various experiments,\nwhich have led to a more systematic investigation of hypernuclei, although no experiment has been able to measure directly the whole set of partial decay rates.\nAt Brookhaven [37, 96] (starting since 1983) and KEK [38, 98, 140] (since 1989),\nthe (\u03c0 + , K + ) strangeness associated production reaction has been used. At J\u00fclich\n(COSY) [42, 139], by using proton\u2013nucleus scattering processes, the total lifetime of\nvery heavy hypernuclei (in the region of bismuth and uranium: A \u2243 200 \u00f7 240) has\nbeen measured by delayed fission observations. By using the same techniques [138],\nagain at COSY, the lifetime for hypernuclei with mass numbers A = 180\u00b15, produced\nin p\u2013Au collisions, has been obtained. At BNL AGS [141], the 12\n\u039b B hypernucleus has\n\u2212\n0\nbeen produced by the (stopped K , \u03c0 ) reaction, the \u039b being created on a proton,\nwith the final \u03c0 0 detected by a high energy resolution (less than 1 MeV FWHM) neutral meson spectrometer. At BNL [64] and KEK [63] the process (K \u2212 , K + ) produces\nstrangeness \u22122 hypernuclei, which are important for the study of the \u039b\u039b and \u039eN\ninteractions.\nSeveral experiments are planned for the future. At TJNAF laboratories [103], by\nusing the electroproduction reaction (e, e\u2032 , K + ), hypernuclear levels will be observed\nwith high\u2013resolution (\u2243 0.6 MeV FWHM) and, through fission fragment detection\ntechniques, the lifetimes of heavy hypernuclei will be measured with great accuracy\nand precise identification of the decayed system [104]. In the near future, within\nthe Japan Hadron Facility (JHF) project, at KEK a germanium detector system will\nmeasure the hypernuclear \u03b3\u2013ray transitions with an energy resolution around 300\nKeV FWHM [102]. Germanium detectors with a few KeV resolution are already\ncollecting \u03b3\u2013spectroscopy data at BNL and KEK [22, 88]. Experiments of this kind\nwill be essential for a better understanding of the \u039bN spin\u2013dependent interactions.\nFinally, the FINUDA facility [93] will make use of very thin targets (\u2243 0.1 gr/cm2 )\nand large detector acceptance (\u2243 2\u03c0 sr). The (stopped K \u2212 , \u03c0 \u2212 ) production reaction,\nalready employed at KEK [46, 91, 92], will be used, with low energy K \u2212 (\u2243 16 MeV)\ncoming from the decay of the \u03c6 mesons (\u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 , B.R.= 49.1%). This mesons\nwill be created at the Da\u03a6ne e+ e\u2212 collider at a center\u2013of\u2013mass energy of 1.02 GeV.\n27\n\n\fThe experiment has been designed to work with high production rate (about 80 hypernuclei produced per hour at the e+ e\u2212 luminosity of 1032 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ), high\u2013resolution\nspectroscopy (\u2243 0.7 MeV FWHM) and high precision in the measurements of the\nweak decay rates (2% statistical error on the total lifetimes for one week of data taking at L = 1032 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ). The \u03c0 \u2212 coming from the hypernuclear production could be\ndetected by the FINUDA spectrometer in coincidence with all the particles emitted\nin the subsequent decay. It will be possible to measure the \u0393n /\u0393p ratio with precision\nbetter than the one of the other running experiments and to use about 10 different\ntargets, covering the whole mass range, for a systematic study of production and\ndecay of hypernuclei. We think that the wide program of FINUDA could represent a\nnew step forward in understanding the hypernuclear phenomena.\nThe main results obtained with the above listed experiments will be quoted at the\nend of the next subsection, for a comparison with theoretical predictions.\n\n4.2\n\nTheory\n\nWe summarize here the historical evolution of the various theoretical approaches\nutilized for the evaluation of the weak decay of \u039b\u2013hypernuclei. Some details of the\nformalisms employed in the calculations are given in the next section. The numerical\nresults of the different calculations are reported and discussed at the end of this\nsubsection, in tables 2\u20139.\nThe first calculations of the mesonic rate for light hypernuclei date at the end of\nthe 50's [113]. The Pauli blocking effect for nuclear decay was estimated and used in\norder to assign the spin to the ground state of s\u2013shell hypernuclei.\nThe possibility of non\u2013mesonic hypernuclear decay was suggested for the first time\nin 1953 [142] and interpreted in terms of the free space \u039b \u2192 \u03c0N decay, where the\npion was considered as virtual and then absorbed by a bound nucleon.\nIn the 60's Block and Dalitz [143\u2013145] developed a phenomenological model, which\nhas been more recently updated [146\u2013148]. Within this approach, some important\ncharacteristics of the non\u2013mesonic decays (for instance the validity of the \u2206I = 1/2\nrule) of s\u2013shell hypernuclei can be reproduced in terms of elementary spin\u2013dependent\nbranching ratios for the \u039bn \u2192 nn and \u039bp \u2192 np processes, by fitting the available\nexperimental data (see the discussion in subsection 6.3). Although this kind of analysis makes use of several delicate assumptions, it has the good feature that it does\nnot need the knowledge of the effective Hamiltonian for the reaction mechanism. An\ninteresting empirical conclusion of Ref. [144], never explained on theoretical ground,\nis the dominance of the \u039bN(3 S1 ) \u2192 NN(3 P1 ) transition, which leads to large \u0393n /\u0393p\nratios (\u2243 1 \u00f7 2) for 5\u039b He. Following the phenomenological approach, it emerges that\nin order to establish the degree of violation of the \u2206I = 1/2 rule in the non\u2013mesonic\ndecays of s\u2013shell hypernuclei, we need more precise measurements of \u0393n and \u0393p , especially for 4\u039b H. With the present data one cannot exclude a large violation of the\n\u2206I = 1/2 rule [147\u2013150]. In Ref. [150] the authors came to the conclusion that the\n\u2206I = 1/2 rule is strongly violated by observing that the experimental lifetimes of\nheavy hypernuclei (in the region A \u2243 180 \u00f7 220) seem to favour \u0393n /\u0393p ratios larger\nthan 2, while \u0393n /\u0393p should be \u2264 2 if the \u2206I = 1/2 rule is not violated. However,\nwe point out that, in the phenomenological analysis, the inequality \u0393n /\u0393p \u2264 2 for\nnuclear matter is valid if the \u039b decays by interacting only with s\u2013shell nucleons, while\n28\n\n\fin heavy systems p\u2013shell nucleons are expected to contribute too [see Eqs. (68), (71)\nand the discussion of paragraph 6.3.1 for 12\n\u039b C].\nAfter the first analysis by Block and Dalitz, microscopic models of the \u039bN \u2192 NN\ninteraction began to be developed. The first paper, for nuclear matter, including only\nL = 0 \u039bN relative states, is due to Adams [151] (his numerical results are quoted in\ntables 2, 7). He used the OPE description with \u2206I = 1/2 \u039bN\u03c0 couplings within a\nFermi gas model and found a large sensitivity of the decay widths to the NN and \u039bN\nshort range repulsive correlations. For \u039bN they were described through the arbitrary\ninsertion, in the two\u2013body transition matrix element, of an analytical function which\nwas an approximation to the exact solution of the Bethe\u2013Goldstone equation with\na hard\u2013core potential (rcore \u2243 0.4 fm). The obtained results were not realistic also\nbecause the employed \u039bN\u03c0 coupling was too small to reproduce the \u039b free lifetime.\nTaking this into account, the Adams' results for \u0393NM should be multiplied by 6.81,\nas it is done in table 2.\nAfterwards, in order to improve the OPE model, mesons heavier than the pion\nhave been introduced as mediators of the \u039bN \u2192 NN interaction. McKellar and Gibson [152] evaluated the width for a \u039b in nuclear matter, adding the exchange of the\n\u03c1\u2013meson and taking into account \u039bN relative S states only. They calculated the \u039bN\u03c1\nweak vertex (experimentally not accessible) by using the factorization approximation\n(which, however, contains many ambiguities) and a pole model. The authors assumed\nthe \u2206I = 1/2 rule and made the calculation by using the two possible relative signs\n(being at the time unknown and not fixed by their model) between the pion and rho\npotentials, V\u03c0 + |V\u03c1 | and V\u03c0 \u2212 |V\u03c1 |, with very different results in the two cases. In\ntable 2 the listed results are the ones with the (nowadays fixed) right sign, namely\nV\u03c0 \u2212 |V\u03c1 |. It is important to note that for mesons heavier than the pion, no experimental indication supports the validity of the \u2206I = 1/2 rule for their couplings with\nbaryons (for example, see Ref. [127] for an evaluation of the violation of the \u2206I = 1/2\nrule in the \u039b \u2192 \u03c1N vertex). Some years later, Nardulli [153] determined the relative sign (\u2212) between \u03c0 and \u03c1 exchange by using a somewhat different pole model,\nalso implementing the available information from weak non\u2013leptonic and radiative\ndecays. Refs. [152, 153] obtained a non\u2013mesonic width in the (\u03c0 + \u03c1)\u2013exchange model\nsmaller than the OPE one. This characteristic resulted from a destructive interference between the two mesons and would have been confirmed in the future. In [153]\nthe \u0393n /\u0393p ratio in (\u03c0 + \u03c1)\u2013exchange resulted sizeably increased with respect to the\nOPE value (see table 7). However, more recent calculations [120, 154] showed a small\neffect of the \u03c1\u2013exchange on \u0393n /\u0393p . Takeuki, Takaki and Bando [155, 156] applied a\nmodel with (\u03c0 + \u03c1)\u2013exchange to 4\u039b H, 4\u039b He and 5\u039b He, finding quite small non\u2013mesonic\nrates when pion and rho have negative relative phase (see table 4). The same result\nwas obtained in Ref. [152] for nuclear matter. More recently [154], a (\u03c0 + \u03c1) model\nhas been applied to 12\n\u039b C. The authors found the central potential from \u03c1\u2013exchange\n(omitted in the previous calculations) to be more important than the tensor part.\nMoreover, the \u0393n /\u0393p ratio remained unchanged when the rho\u2013meson was included\n(see tables 3, 8). The conclusion we can draw from the calculations that include the\n\u03c1\u2013exchange is that the results strongly depend on the model used for the evaluation\nof the \u039bN\u03c1 vertex. Nevertheless, today there is a general consent that the inclusion\nof the \u03c1 cannot improve the calculation of \u0393n /\u0393p [120, 123].\nIn 1986 Dubach et al. [122] introduced a OME model with \u03c0, \u03c1, K, K \u2217 , \u03c9 and \u03b7, for\n29\n\n\fa calculation in nuclear matter. The \u0393n /\u0393p is expected to be sensitive to the isospin\nstructure of the transition potential. Therefore, the inclusion of mesons heavier than\nthe pion could give ratios in better agreement with the data. In order to evaluate\nthe meson\u2013baryon\u2013baryon vertices which are not accessible to the experiment, a quite\nlarge number of different models (pole model, SU(6)w symmetry, PCAC, Goldberger\u2013\nTreiman relations, etc) have been used, also enforcing the \u2206I = 1/2 rule. The\ncalculation of the above vertices is strongly model\u2013dependent, and this makes the use\nof potentials with mesons other than the pion almost unpraticable. The above cited\npaper only reports preliminary results, while the final ones are published in Ref. [123]\n(see tables 2\u20134, 7\u20139). Here the model is also extended, within the extreme single\nparticle shell model, to finite nuclei (5\u039b He and 12\n\u039b C). The controversial results presented\nin [123] caused debate and critical discussions in the literature. Because of the few\ndetails available from Ref. [123] (which, on the other hand, does not take into account\nthe hadronic form factors and quotes some different results from the preliminary ones\nof Ref. [122]), it is not possible to compare the model used in this work for the OME\npotential with other ones proposed afterwards, for example by Ramos and Bennhold\n[157] and Parre\u00f1o et al. [120], where the decay is again treated in a shell model\nframework. In Ref. [120], differently from [123], all the possible \u039bN and NN relative\nstates have been included. The unknown hadronic vertices have been obtained from\npole model, soft meson theorems and SU(6)w symmetry. The repulsive baryon\u2013\nbaryon correlation were based on Nijmegen and J\u00fclich \u039bN and NN interactions.\nThe calculation of the unknown hadronic vertices turned out to be model\u2013dependent\nand the obtained decay rates were very different from the ones of Ref. [123]. Ref. [120]\ncalculated the non\u2013mesonic widths in the OME picture to be different at most by 15%\n5\nfrom the OPE ones for 12\n\u039b C and \u039b He (see tables 3, 4, 8, 9). The \u0393n /\u0393p ratio in the\nfull OME turned out to be 30% smaller than the OPE value for 12\n\u039b C, in contrast with\nthe improved ratio of Ref. [123], even if it was quite sensitive to the isospin structure\nof the exchanged mesons (the largest changes corresponding to the inclusion of the\nstrange meson K). This was mainly due to the destructive interference between\nthe exchange of mesons with the same isospin [(\u03c0, \u03c1), (K, K \u2217 ), (\u03c9, \u03b7)]. Moreover,\nthe contribution of mesons heavier than the pion were suppressed by form factors\nand short range correlations. Very recently, in Ref. [118], the authors of Ref. [120]\ncorrected a mistake they made in the inclusion of the K\u2013 and K \u2217 \u2013exchange. This\nhad the effect of increasing the \u0393n /\u0393p ratio: (\u0393n /\u0393p )OME \u2243 4(\u0393n /\u0393p )OPE . The only\ninclusion of the K\u2013meson in addition to the pion leads to a smaller \u0393n + \u0393p and\nsignificantly enhances the \u0393n /\u0393p ratio (see tables 3, 4, 8, 9). This behaviour has\nbeen confirmed by other recent calculations [125, 131] (even if the different numerical\nresults are not always compatible), which are discussed in the following. In [118]\nthe authors also presented a detailed (T \u2013matrix) study of the final state interactions\nacting between the nucleons emitted in the non\u2013mesonic decay.\nRecently, the authors of Ref. [115] studied the decay of the hypertriton (3\u039b H) in\nthe full OME picture of Ref. [120]. They worked in the framework of the Faddeev\nequation, which allows to exactly calculate (at least in principle) wave functions and\nfinal scattering states for three\u2013body systems. They reproduced the experimental\n\u039b separation energy and the total lifetime of 3\u039b H, obtaining \u0393T /\u0393free\n= 1.03. The\n\u039b\nnon\u2013mesonic width was found to be 1.7% of the free \u039b decay rate, only a little less\nthan the calculation with pion\u2013exchange alone.\n30\n\n\fThe OME model of Ref. [120] has also been employed, in Ref. [158], to discuss the\neffects of the nuclear deformation on the non\u2013mesonic decay of p\u2013shell hypernuclei.\nBy using the Nilsson model with realistic values of the deformation parameter, the\nauthors found that, due to nuclear deformation, both \u0393n + \u0393p and \u0393n /\u0393p can change\nat most by about 10% with respect to the spherical limit. In view of the corrections\nmade in Ref. [118] to the OME model of Ref. [120], the results obtained in the above\ndiscussed Refs. [115, 158] should be updated.\nIn addition to the exchange of one pion, other authors have included in the non\u2013\nmesonic transition potential the exchange of two pions (correlated [117, 119, 124] or\nnot [159\u2013161] into \u03c3 and \u03c1 resonances). In Ref. [159] the two\u2013pion\u2013exchange mechanism contains the \u03a3N intermediate state, and the \u2206I = 1/2 rule is enforced in the\n\u039bN\u03c0 and \u03a3N\u03c0 vertices. The intermediate NN state has to be excluded in order to\navoid a double counting when the uncorrelated 2\u03c0\u2013exchange is employed in connection with short range correlations. The authors of [159] found that the \u03a3 component\nfurther reduces (with respect to the OPE value) the \u0393n /\u0393p ratio. On the contrary, a\n15% increase of the OPE ratio was found in Ref. [161], due to the \u03a3N intermediate\nstate in uncorrelated 2\u03c0\u2013exchange (see tables 2, 7). From the results of Ref. [160]\non the \u039bN \u2192 NN matrix elements we can point out that the inclusion of both\nthe \u03a3N and \u2206N intermediate states in the 2\u03c0\u2013exchange could sizeably increase the\nOPE \u0393n /\u0393p ratio. This conclusion comes from the observation that large 1 S0 \u2192 1 S0\ntransitions were obtained for uncorrelated 2\u03c0\u2013exchange. The same finding about the\nimportance of 1 S0 \u2192 1 S0 transitions comes from Ref. [124] for correlated 2\u03c0\u2013exchange.\nIn Ref. [117] an improvement of \u0393n /\u0393p for 12\n\u039b C and \u2206I = 3/2 contributions (introduced by the boson\u2013boson coupling model) less important than the \u2206I = 1/2 ones\nwere found by employing correlated two\u2013pion\u2013exchange (2\u03c0/\u03c1 + 2\u03c0/\u03c3) in addition\nto the OPE (see tables 3, 4, 8). The authors also studied the A\u2013dependence of the\nnon\u2013mesonic decay rate and reproduced the data for light hypernuclei but not the\nsaturation of \u0393NM at large A.\nThe baryon\u2013baryon short range interactions have been studied by Cheung, Heddle\nand Kisslinger [129] by using an hybrid model, through which the decay is described\nby two separate mechanisms: the long range interactions (r \u2265 0.8 fm) are treated in\nterms of hadronic degrees of freedom (OPE with \u2206I = 1/2 rule), while the short range\ninteractions (which cannot be explained in terms of meson exchange) are described by\na 6\u2013quark cluster model, which includes both \u2206I = 1/2 and \u2206I = 3/2 components\n(see tables 2, 3).\nIn Ref. [126], Maltman and Shmatikov combined a OME potential containing\n(\u03c0 + K)\u2013exchange for long distance interactions and a quark model picture at short\ndistances again in a hybrid model. By employing also the effective weak Hamiltonian\nmodified by perturbative QCD effects of Ref. [106], the authors obtained significant\nviolations of the \u2206I = 1/2 rule in the J = 0 \u039bN \u2192 NN amplitudes. As they\npointed out, this should sizeably modify the value of \u0393n /\u0393p in nuclei. In Ref. [127]\nthe same authors evaluated the \u2206I = 3/2 contribution to the \u039bN\u03c1 coupling by using\nthe factorization approximation and obtained for it a magnitude comparable with the\n\u2206I = 1/2 contribution.\nMore recently, Inoue et al. [121, 130] treated the non\u2013mesonic \u039b decay in s\u2013shell\nhypernuclei within a direct quark model combined with the OPE description (enforcing here the \u2206I = 1/2 rule). In their model the NN and \u039bN repulsion at short\n31\n\n\fdistance originates from quark exchange between baryons (induced by the quark anti\u2013\nsymmetrization) and gluon exchange between quarks. The main uncertainties in this\nkind of approach come from the parameterization of the effective weak Hamiltonian\nfor quarks, obtained through the so\u2013called Operator Product Expansion [106], which\ncontains perturbative QCD effects and, by construction, terms associated to both\n\u2206I = 1/2 and \u2206I = 3/2 transitions. The authors found that the direct quark (DQ)\nmechanism was significant, giving sizeable \u2206I = 3/2 contributions in the J = 0 channel, in agreement with Ref. [126]. The results on the \u0393n /\u0393p ratio are more consistent\n(even if sizeable discrepancies still remain) with the experiment, because of a large\nincrease (with respect to the OPE) of the neutron\u2013induced decay rate (see tables 4,\n9). Unfortunately, the calculation is only made for s\u2013shell hypernuclei (and, as we\nwill mention just below, for symmetric nuclear matter in [131]), and the employed\nquark Hamiltonian is not able to reproduce the large ratio between the \u2206I = 1/2\nand \u2206I = 3/2 amplitudes observed in the free \u039b decay. At present, the data on\nhypernuclei do not allow the extraction of the \u2206I = 3/2 amplitude in \u039bN \u2192 NN\n(see the discussion of subsection 6.3). Notice, however, that in Ref. [162] Oka showed\nthat the \u2206I = 3/2 component is probed, in a clean way, by the soft \u03c0 + emission\nobserved in the \u039b nuclear decay (\u039b \u2192 \u03c0 0 n followed by \u03c0 0 p \u2192 \u03c0 + n), because of the\nabsence of the \u2206I = 1/2 component. Another delicate point in models with a direct\nquark contribution is related to double counting and superposition problems, which\ncould arise when both the quark and hadronic description are employed together.\nHowever, this does not seem to be a problem in the calculations by Inoue et al.,\nbecause their relativistic formalism does not allow the exchange of quark\u2013antiquark\npairs in the direct quark baryon\u2013baryon interaction. Moreover, in the soft pion limit,\nthey determined the relative phase between the OPE and the direct quark contributions. Apart from the quoted problems, it would be interesting to establish the\nconnection between the quark effective weak Hamiltonian and the phenomenological\n\u039b weak vertex. On the other hand, the possibility that the subnucleonic degrees of\nfreedom play a role in nuclear systems remains an interesting field of research, and\nthe non\u2013mesonic decay of \u039b\u2013hypernuclei could reveal itself as the only good tool to\nstudy such effects. The systematic measurement of the partial non\u2013mesonic rates\nwill be useful in distinguishing the different decay mechanisms (meson exchange and\ndirect quark interactions).\nVery recently [131], the direct quark mechanism has been combined with a full\nOME potential (\u03c0, \u03c1, K, K \u2217, \u03b7, \u03c9), for calculations in nuclear matter and in s\u2013shell hypernuclei (see tables 2, 4, 7, 9). The authors compared the OME model with the Light\nMesons (\u03c0, K) + Direct Quark model: the short range repulsion is given, respectively,\nby heavy\u2013meson\u2013exchange and direct quark mechanism. Heavy\u2013meson\u2013exchange and\ndirect quark contributions employed together could cause double counting problems:\nin any case, the authors obtained that the OME + DQ description does not improve\nthe results. Both the previous pictures, namely OME and \u03c0 + K + DQ, gave the\nbest results of the calculation: also the \u0393n /\u0393p ratio is significantly improved when\nthe \u03c0 + K + DQ model is employed, both for 5\u039b He hypernuclei and nuclear matter\n(considered as an approximate description of heavy hypernuclei).\nEffects of a violation of the \u2206I = 1/2 rule in \u039bN \u2192 NN have been studied in\nRef. [128] by Parre\u00f1o et al. The employed OME model is the same of Ref. [120],\nwith hadronic couplings evaluated in the factorization approximation. The conclu32\n\n\fsion reached by the authors is different from the one of Inoue et al. [121]: even by\nintroducing large \u2206I = 3/2 contributions (of the order of the \u2206I = 1/2 ones), to\ntake into account the ambiguities in the factorization approximation, the calculated\n\u0393n /\u0393p ratio for 12\n\u039b C remains abundantly below the experimental values (see tables 3,\n8). We recall that the OME model employed in Refs. [120, 128] has been recently\ncorrected in Ref. [118]. A similar correction could affect the conclusions obtained\nwith a \u2206I = 3/2 contribution.\nConcerning the \u0393n /\u0393p puzzle we quote here a different mechanism, which has\nbeen suggested by the authors of Ref. [132]. In order to describe the process \u039bN \u2192\nNN, they employed, in addition to the OPE at large distances, a phenomenological\n4\u2013baryon point interaction for short range interactions, including \u2206I = 3/2 contributions as well. Such a 4\u2013baryon interaction was initially considered by Block and Dalitz\n[144] as an approximation of the short range interactions mediated by heavy mesons.\nBy properly fixing the different phenomenological coupling constants of the problem\n(in particular, by using a small \u2206I = 3/2 component), the authors of Ref. [132] could\nfit fairly well both the experimental \u0393n + \u0393p and \u0393n /\u0393p in 4\u039b He, 5\u039b He and 12\n\u039b C (see\ntables 3, 4, 8, 9).\nUp to this point we have essentially discussed theoretical evaluations of the non\u2013\nmesonic hypernuclear decay, which is the dominant channel for all hypernuclei, but\nfor the s\u2013shell ones. Concerning the mesonic decay, Refs. [44, 45] presented a study of\nthe 5\u039b He decay using a quark model based hypernuclear wave function. The authors\nhave shown how the short range \u039bN repulsion (which naturally arises in a quark\nmodel) is relevant to reproduce the observed mesonic rates in s\u2013shell hypernuclei (see\ntable 6). In 1993, Nieves and Oset [108] calculated the mesonic widths for a broad\n209\nrange of \u039b\u2013hypernuclei (from 12\n\u039b C to \u039b Pb). They used a shell model picture and\ndistorted pionic wave functions, solutions of a pion\u2013nucleus optical potential. The\nresults showed wild oscillations of \u0393\u03c0\u2212 /\u0393\u03c00 around the value (equal to 2) predicted by\nthe \u2206I = 1/2 rule for N = Z closed shell hypernuclei. This was due to effects of the\nhypernuclear shell structure. Similar calculations have been carried out by Itonaga,\nMotoba, and Bando in Refs. [110, 156]. With respect to Ref. [108], they use different\noptical potentials and descriptions of the energy balance in the decays (more accurate\nin [108]), and obtain somewhat dissimilar results (especially in very heavy systems).\nMotoba and Itonaga updated the calculations in Ref. [109] by using an improved\noptical potential (see tables 5, 6). Both the evaluations of Nieves\u2013Oset and Motoba\u2013\nItonaga\u2013Bando showed how the mesonic rate strongly depends on the competition\nbetween the Pauli blocking, which suppresses the decay, and the enhancement due\nto the pion wave distortion in the medium. When the pion wave is distorted by the\noptical potential, for A > 100 the mesonic width is enhanced by one/two orders of\nmagnitude with respect to the calculation without pion distortion. For the decay into\n\u03c0 \u2212 p the Coulomb distortion alone gives rise to a non\u2013negligible enhancement. The\nresults of the above calculations for light to heavy hypernuclei are shown in Fig. 13\nof subsection 5.6.\nA different approach, which allows a unified treatment of mesonic and non\u2013\nmesonic channels and automatically includes all the partial waves of the relative \u039bN\nmotion, has been suggested by Oset and Salcedo [163] (see tables 2\u20136) and utilizes\nthe Random Phase Approximation (RPA) within the framework of the polarization\npropagators. We shall discuss in detail this method in the next section. Here we\n33\n\n\fonly remind the reader that the crucial point for the evaluation of the decay rates\nis a realistic description of the pion self\u2013energy in the medium and (especially for\nthe evaluation of \u0393NM ) of the baryon\u2013baryon short range correlations. More recently,\nthis model has been applied to the calculation, in nuclear matter, of the three\u2013body\ndecay \u039bNN \u2192 NNN [164] (see table 2), through a purely phenomenological parameterization (by means of data on deep inelastic (e, e\u2032 ) scattering and pionic atoms)\nof the 2p\u20132h excitations in the pion self\u2013energy. A more detailed analysis of \u03932 ,\nalso implemented in finite nuclei via the local density approximation, has been made\nin Ref. [165] (see tables 3, 5). Here, the authors employed a more realistic 2p\u20132h\npolarization propagator, based again on an empirical analysis of pionic atoms but\nalso extended to kinematical regions not accessible by this phenomenology. The introduction of a new non\u2013negligible (as found in the above mentioned calculations)\ntwo\u2013nucleon induced non\u2013mesonic channel requires a reanalysis of the \u0393n /\u0393p ratio.\nThe most recent calculations performed within the polarization propagator method\ncan be found in Refs. [125, 166, 167]. They reproduce quite well both the mesonic and\nnon\u2013mesonic rates for light to heavy hypernuclei, although problems related to the\n\u0393n /\u0393p ratio still remain. The results obtained in [166, 167] will be discussed in detail\nin subsections 5.6 and 5.7; those of Ref. [125] are listed in tables 3, 8. In Ref. [125] the\none\u2013nucleon induced non\u2013mesonic decay has been studied within a meson\u2013exchange\napproach including one pion, one kaon, correlated and uncorrelated 2\u03c0\u2013exchange and\n\u03c9\u2013exchange (\u03c0 + K + 2\u03c0/\u03c3+ unc 2\u03c0 + \u03c9). The correlated 2\u03c0\u2013exchange (in the \u03c3\nchannel) has been treated in terms of a chiral unitary approach to the \u03c0\u03c0 scattering.\nFor the NN interaction this approach leads to a \u03c3\u2013meson\u2013exchange potential with a\n> 0.9 fm and a repulsion at shorter distances, in contrast\nmoderate attraction at r \u223c\nwith the attraction of the conventional \u03c3\u2013exchange. Once the correlated and uncorrelated 2\u03c0\u2013exchange are added, a net NN attraction is obtained for all distances. In\norder to restore the behaviour of realistic NN potentials, which present a moderate\nattraction only at intermediate distances, the authors of Ref. [125] introduced the\nexchange of the \u03c9\u2013meson to produce the required repulsion. A large cancellation between \u03c3\u2013exchange and uncorrelated 2\u03c0\u2013exchange has been found for momenta around\nthe relevant value 420 MeV. Consequently, the total 2\u03c0\u2013exchange contribution to the\ndecay turned out to be small (around 10% on \u0393n and \u0393p ). The \u03c9\u2013exchange gave a\ncontribution of the same order of magnitude. On the contrary, the K\u2013exchange, also\nconstrained by chiral unitary theory, has been of primary importance to reproduce\nthe experimental non\u2013mesonic rate \u0393NM = \u0393n + \u0393p and to improve the OPE \u0393n /\u0393p\nFull\nratio for 12\n\u2243 4.5 (\u0393n /\u0393p )OPE . In Ref. [168], still within the polariza\u039b C: (\u0393n /\u0393p )\ntion propagators framework, by using a relativistic mean\u2013field approximation to the\nWalecka model, the authors evaluated the ring OPE non\u2013mesonic decay widths to be\nconsiderably smaller than the non\u2013relativistic ones of Refs. [125, 166, 167] (see tables\n3, 5 and subsections 5.6, 5.7). This also seems to be unrealistic when compared with\nthe findings of Ref. [169]. Here, by employing the Walecka model within the wave\nfunction formalism, the relativistic OPE calculation gave nuclear matter non\u2013mesonic\nrates larger (by about 40%) than the non\u2013relativistic ones (see table 2, 7). However,\nwe remind the reader that this calculation does not include the effects of vertex form\nfactors and short range correlations, which significantly reduce the non\u2013mesonic rates,\nboth in the relativistic and non\u2013relativistic descriptions.\nIn tables 2\u20139 the numerical results obtained within the above discussed models\n34\n\n\fare summarized and compared with experimental data. The decay widths are in units\nof the free \u039b width.\nTab. 2: Decay width for a \u039b in nuclear matter\nThe results of Adams are corrected for the small \u039b\u03c0N coupling constant he used,\nas explained above. All the uncorrelated OPE decay widths are compatible with a\nvalue of about 4. The result by Cheung et al. is sizeably smaller than 4, but we\nrecall that in their calculation the pion\u2013exchange is only active for r > 0.8 fm, while\na large OPE contribution comes from smaller distances. This is equivalent to use\nvery strong short range correlations (SRC), which prevent the process for r < 0.8 fm.\nDifferences among the various calculations are observed when the effects of SRC and\nform factors (FF) are included in the OPE models. They reduce the uncorrelated\n> 2. Adams used an inappropriate (too strong) correlation for\nwidths by a factor \u223c\nthe tensorial transition 3 S1 \u2192 3 D1 . Neglecting the tensorial SRC, his correlated\nresult (1.57) is more realistic. The differences among the other calculations may\nbe understood taking into account the parameterizations used for SRC and FF. For\nexample, in the polarization propagator method (PPM) of Ref. [163], a monopole\nFF with cut\u2013off \u039b\u03c0 = 1.3 GeV is used, while in Ref. [152] a softer FF is employed\n(\u039b\u03c0 \u2243 0.6 GeV). This is responsible for the ratio 2.1 between the results of Refs. [163]\nand [152]. The inclusion of the \u03c1\u2013exchange in the transition potential decreases the\ndecay rate (this characteristic has been confirmed in finite nucleus calculations): in\nRef. [152] the \u03c1\u2013meson leads to an unrealistic almost complete cancellation of the\nOPE contribution. The results of Nardulli refer to different choices for the FF. Also\nthe one\u2013meson\u2013exchange (OME) models (we refer, here and in the following, to OME\nmodels when the transition potential contains the exchange of \u03c0, \u03c1, K, K \u2217 , \u03c9, and \u03b7\nmesons) tends to reduce the rate with respect to the pure OPE calculation. This is\nalso true, as we shall see in the next tables, for finite hypernuclei. In particular, the K\u2013\nmeson\u2013exchange considerably cancels the OPE contribution [131]. From inspection\nof the experimental data on heavy hypernuclei one concludes that realistic values of\nthe \u039b decay rate in nuclear matter lie in the range 1.5 \u00f7 2.\n\n35\n\n\fTable 2: Decay width for a \u039b in nuclear matter (\u0393T \u2261 \u0393NM ).\nRef.\nUnc + SRC + SRC + FF\nModel\nAdams 1967 [151]\n3.47\n0.38\nOPE\n1.57\nno tensor SRC\nDalitz 1973 [145]\n2.0\nContact int.\nCheung et al. 1983\u201386 [129] 0.99\n0.77\nOPE > 0.8 fm\n3.0\nHybrid\nMcKellar\u2013Gibson 1984 [152] 4.13\n2.31\n1.06\nOPE\n1.13\n0.72\n0.10\n\u03c0+\u03c1\nOset\u2013Salcedo 1985 [163]\n4.3\n2.2\nPPM\nDubach et al. 1986 [122]\n3.89\n1.82\nOPE\n1.55\n\u03c0+\u03c1\n1.23\nOME\nNardulli 1988 [153]\n0.7 \u00f7 2.1\n\u03c0+\u03c1\nAlberico et al. 1991 [164]\n1.74\nPPM with 2B\nShinmura 1993 [169]\n2.92\nOPE\n3.97\nRel OPE\nShinmura 1995 [161]\n1.73\nOPE\n1.85\n\u03c0+ unc 2\u03c0\nDubach et al. 1996 [123]\n4.66\n1.85\nOPE\n1.38\nOME\nSasaki et al. 2000 [131]\n2.819\n1.850\nOPE\n2.068\n1.216\n\u03c0+K\n2.863\n1.906\nOME\n2.456\n\u03c0 + K + DQ\n\n36\n\n\fTab. 3: Non\u2013mesonic decay width for\n\n12\n\u039b C.\n\nThe OPE results of Cheung et al. underestimate the experiment for the same reason\nexplained in connection with the calculation in nuclear matter. Note that here the\nreduction obtained in going from the uncorrelated case to the correlated one is even\nsmaller than what occurred in nuclear matter. In this calculation, the SRC in OPE\nplays a little role because the \u03c0\u2013exchange is only active for distances r > 0.8 fm.\nHowever, the complete result (hybrid model) of Ref. [129] is realistic. The relativistic\npolarization propagator method (Rel PPM) of Ref. [168] predicts a too small decay\nrate. On the contrary, the non\u2013relativistic PPM's of Refs. [163, 165] overestimate the\ndata because of the use of unrealistic SRC and \u039b wave functions. The calculation\nby Dubach et al. [123] provides a too large uncorrelated OPE rate [too small is the\nreduction with respect to their calculation (3.89 in Ref. [122] and 4.66 in Ref. [123])\nfor nuclear matter] and too small correlated results, both in OPE and in the full OME.\nThe available computational details of Refs. [122, 123] do not allow to explain these\ncontroversial results. All the other correlated OPE calculations (apart from the case of\nRef. [132]) are compatible with the experiment and give rates reduced with respect to\nthe uncorrelated ones by a factor 1.5\u00f72. The \u03c0+\u03c1, \u03c0+2\u03c0/\u03c1+2\u03c0/\u03c3 and OME rates are\nquite similar to the OPE estimates. In Ref. [128], \u2206I = 3/2 contributions to the \u039b \u2192\n\u03c0N transition are evaluated in the factorization approximation: their effect on the\nnon\u2013mesonic rate seems very small. In Ref. [125], the authors used the polarization\npropagator method with (\u03c0 + K + 2\u03c0/\u03c3+ unc 2\u03c0 + \u03c9)\u2013exchange. The result for the\none\u2013nucleon induced non\u2013mesonic rate of the full calculation is reduced with respect\nto the OPE value of about 30%. This is due, almost completely, to K\u2013exchange. The\nfull result including the two\u2013body induced contribution (2B) has been obtained by\nadding the value \u03932 = 0.27 obtained in Ref. [165]. Realistic calculations supply non\u2013\nmesonic widths in 12\n\u039b C reduced by a factor 1.5\u00f72 with respect to the values for nuclear\nmatter. The results of Parre\u00f1o and Ramos of Ref. [118] correct those of Ref. [120]\n(due to a mistake in the inclusion of the K and K \u2217 contributions) and correspond to\nthe use of different Nijmegen models [7, 8] for the hadronic coupling constants. The\nauthors also made an accurate evaluation of the final state interactions between the\noutgoing nucleons, by using the scattering NN wave function from the Lippmann\u2013\nSchwinger (T \u2013matrix) equation obtained with the Nijmegen NN potentials. The\nK\u2013exchange decreases the rate \u0393n + \u0393p with respect to the one calculated in OPE by\nabout 26% in Ref. [125] and 37 \u00f7 45% in Ref.

Unrealistic rates are predicted by Refs. [155, 163]. The result of Ref. [155]\npresents a strong cancellation between \u03c0\u2013 and \u03c1\u2013exchange. In [163] the authors overestimated \u0393NM because they employed a wave function for the hyperon too much\nsuperimposed with the nuclear core. We remind the reader that \u039b\u22124 He potentials\nconsistent with experimental observations have a repulsive core. By using the same\nmodel, with a more realistic \u039b wave function (calculated from a variational method)\nthe same authors obtained [172] a non\u2013mesonic width compatible with the experiment. There are remarkable differences among the several OPE estimates, ranging\nfrom 0.144 (Takeuchi et al.) to 0.9 (Dubach et al.). Because of the lack of technical\ndetails, the calculation of Dubach et al. cannot be easily compared with the other\nones. We remark that they do not take into account of the FF, which reduce the non\u2013\nmesonic width, especially the OPE one. The large difference between their OPE and\nOME results could originate form a double counting between heavy\u2013meson\u2013exchange\nand SRC. It is also rather strange that the uncorrelated OPE result of Dubach et\nal. (0.6, not shown in the table) is smaller than the correlated one (0.9). Another\npoint to recall is that in Ref. [123] the correlated OPE and OME non\u2013mesonic rates\n5\nfor 12\n\u039b C are smaller than the corresponding rates for \u039b He of table 3, while, from\n5\nexperiment, we know that \u0393NM (12\n\u039b C) \u2243 2\u0393NM (\u039b He). The calculations by Inoue et\nal. [121, 130] and Sasaki et al. [131] show different OPE results. They can be understood in terms of the different FF and SRC employed. The calculation or Ref. [118]\nis an updating of that presented in [120]: the intervals shown correspond to the use\nof different Nijmegen models for the hadronic coupling constant. We note that for\n(\u03c0 + K)\u2013exchange the results of Ref. [118] are substantially compatible with the value\nof Ref. [131]. The reduction of the \u03c0 + K rate with respect to the OPE one is larger\nin Ref. [118] (36 \u00f7 45%) than in Ref. [131] (26%).\n\n39\n\n\fTable 4: Non\u2013mesonic decay width for 5\u039b He.\nRef.\n\u0393NM\nModel\nDalitz 1973 [145]\n0.5\nContact int.\nTakeuchi et al. 1985 [155]\n0.144\nOPE\n0.033\n\u03c0+\u03c1\nOset\u2013Salcedo 1985 [163]\n1.15\nPPM\nOset\u2013Salcedo\u2013Usmani 1986 [172]\n0.54\nPPM\nItonaga et al. 1995 [119]\n0.20\nOPE\n0.30\n\u03c0 + 2\u03c0/\u03c3\nParre\u00f1o et al. 1995 [170]\n0.56\nOPE\nDubach et al. 1996 [123]\n0.9\nOPE\n0.5\nOME\nInoue et al. 1996 [130]\n0.333\nOPE\n0.381\nDQ only\nParre\u00f1o et al. 1997 [120]\n0.414\nOME\nItonaga et al. 1998 [117]\n0.39\n\u03c0 + 2\u03c0/\u03c1 + 2\u03c0/\u03c3\nInoue et al. 1998 [121]\n0.216\nOPE\n0.627\nOPE + DQ\nSasaki et al. 2000 [131]\n0.370\nOPE\n0.302\n\u03c0+K\n0.519\n\u03c0 + K+ DQ\nJun et al. 2001 [132]\n0.158\nOPE\n0.426\nOPE + 4BPI\nParre\u00f1o\u2013Ramos 2001 [118]\n0.424 \u00f7 0.425\nOPE\n(correction of [120])\n0.235 \u00f7 0.272\n\u03c0+K\n0.317 \u00f7 0.425\nOME\nExp BNL 1991 [90]\n0.41 \u00b1 0.14\nExp KEK 1995 [173]\n0.50 \u00b1 0.07\n\n40\n\n\fTab. 5: Mesonic decay rate for\n\n12\n\u039b C.\n\nThe results reported in the table are all compatible with the data, which, however,\nhave very large error bars.

However,\nno other estimate that employed a (\u03c0 + \u03c1)\u2013exchange potential has confirmed an important role of the \u03c1\u2013meson in the calculation of \u0393n /\u0393p . In Refs. [122, 123, 131] the\nintroduction of heavier mesons supplies improved ratios: a great improvement, due\nto both the exchange of the K\u2013meson and the DQ process, has been found by Sasaki\net al. [131].\n\nTable 7: \u0393n /\u0393p ratio for nuclear matter.\nRef.\n\u0393n /\u0393p\nModel\nAdams 1967 [151]\n0.35\nOPE\nDubach et al. 1986\u201396 [122, 123]\n0.06\nOPE\n0.08\n\u03c0+\u03c1\n0.34\nOME\nNardulli 1988 [153]\n0.67 \u00f7 1.25\n\u03c0+\u03c1\nShinmura 1993 [169]\n0.255\nRel OPE\nShinmura 1995 [161]\n0.07\nOPE\n0.08\n\u03c0+unc 2\u03c0\nSasaki et al. 2000 [131]\n0.087\nOPE\n0.430\n\u03c0+K\n0.398\nOME\n0.716\n\u03c0 + K+ DQ\n\n43\n\n\fTab. 8: \u0393n /\u0393p ratio for\n\n12\n\u039b C.\n\nAll the calculations but the ones of Refs. [117, 118, 123, 125, 132] strongly underestimate the observed ratios. However, we must notice that the various data have very\nlarge error bars and there are still problems about the methods employed by the\nexperiments to extract \u0393n /\u0393p (see the discussion of section 6). In Ref. [132], in addition to the OPE at large distances, a 4\u2013baryon point interaction (4BPI), including\n\u2206I = 3/2 contributions as well, is employed to describe the short range interactions\nthrough a purely phenomenological model which fits the partial non\u2013mesonic rates\nfor light hypernuclei. However, the values of some of the parameters used in this\nmodel are questionable. The large \u0393n /\u0393p ratio obtained by Dubach et al. in OME\nis not confirmed by the calculations of Refs. [118, 120, 157]. Moreover, we note that\nthe calculation of Dubach et al. obtains a realistic \u0393n /\u0393p but strongly underestimate\n\u0393n + \u0393p (see table 3). Also surprising is the large difference between the results of\nRef. [123] for 12\n\u039b C and nuclear matter (see table 7). The OME calculation in Ref. [120]\nexp\noverestimates \u0393p and underestimates \u0393n : \u0393p \u2243 2\u0393exp\n(we refer, here,\np , \u0393n \u2243 0.1\u0393n\nto the data of Ref. [90]). In Ref. [118], the results of [120] have been corrected for a\nmistake made in the inclusion of the strange mesons exchange (a sign error in certain\ntransitions mediated by K\u2013 and K \u2217 \u2013exchange). The new calculation shows an improvement of the OME \u0393n /\u0393p ratio, mainly due to K\u2013exchange. The results quoted\nin the table has been obtained by means of different models for the calculation of\nthe unknown hadronic vertices and by using the Lippmann\u2013Schwinger equation to\nobtain the scattering wave function for the final NN states. In Ref. [128], by introducing \u2206I = 3/2 contributions in the OME \u039bN \u2192 NN transition amplitude\n(OME + \u2206I = 3/2) of Ref. [120] (which, we remind the reader, contains the above\ndiscussed error), variations of \u0393n only have been obtained. The inclusion of correlated 2\u03c0\u2013exchange in [117] (both in the \u03c3 and \u03c1 channels) improves the calculated\nratio. In Ref. [125], thanks to the K\u2013exchange, a significant improvement of the OPE\nratio has been obtained. The two\u2013pion\u2013exchange (correlated in the \u03c3 channel and\nuncorrelated) as well as the \u03c9\u2013exchange turned out to have small effects on the decay\nrates. The (\u03c0 + K) calculation of Ref. [125] provides a ratio about 52% larger than\nthe maximum value obtained in Ref. [118].\n\n44\n\n\fTable 8: \u0393n /\u0393p ratio for 12\n\u039b C.\nRef.\n\u0393n /\u0393p\nModel\nRamos\u2013Bennhold 1994 [157]\n0.19\nOPE\n0.27\nOME\nParre\u00f1o et al. 1995\u201396 [154]\n0.12\nOPE\n0.12\n\u03c0+\u03c1\nDubach et al. 1996 [123]\n0.20\nOPE\n0.83\nOME\nParre\u00f1o et al. 1997 [120]\n0.104\nOPE\n0.095\n\u03c0+\u03c1\n0.068\nOME\nParre\u00f1o et al. 1998 [128]\n0.068\nOME\n0.034 \u00f7 0.136 OME + \u2206I = 3/2\nItonaga et al. 1998 [117]\n0.10\nOPE\n0.36\n\u03c0 + 2\u03c0/\u03c1 + 2\u03c0/\u03c3\nJun et al. 2001 [132]\n0.08\nOPE\n1.14\nOPE + 4BPI\nJido et al. 2001 [125]\n0.12\nOPE\n0.52\n\u03c0+K\n0.53\n\u03c0 + K + 2\u03c0 + \u03c9\nParre\u00f1o\u2013Ramos 2001 [118] 0.078 \u00f7 0.079\nOPE\n(correction of [120])\n0.205 \u00f7 0.343\n\u03c0+K\n0.288 \u00f7 0.341\nOME\nExp 1974 [135]\n0.59 \u00b1 0.15\nExp BNL 1991 [90]\n1.33+1.12\n\u22120.81\nExp KEK 1995 [98]\n1.87+0.67\n\u22121.16\nExp KEK 2001 [177]\n1.17+0.22\n\u22120.20\n\n45\n\n\fTab. 9: \u0393n /\u0393p ratio for 5\u039b He.\nAlso for 5\u039b He, apart from the phenomenological fit of Ref.

[121, 130] Inoue et al. showed how the direct quark (DQ) mechanism is an\nimportant ingredient in the evaluation of \u0393n /\u0393p . The calculation of Sasaki et al. [131]\nfound a large improvement of the ratio, due to the combined effects of K\u2013exchange\nand DQ mechanism. However, this model tends to overestimate the observed total\nnon\u2013mesonic rates for heavy hypernuclei (see results for nuclear matter in table 2).\nAs explained by the authors, this effect could be originated from the fact that the\nshort range baryon\u2013baryon correlations used in the calculation were not sufficiently\nstrong. The results of Ref. [120] have been revisited in Ref. [118]: here, in addition to\na correction of an error in the previous OME calculation, the authors made a detailed\nanalysis of the final state NN interactions and found a considerable improvement of\nthe ratio. The (\u03c0 + K) calculation of this paper agrees with that of Ref.

Some models\nfind an overall agreement with the experimental total non\u2013mesonic rates, but for the\npartial rates, neutron\u2013 and proton\u2013induced, there are large discrepancies. Only the\ncalculations of Refs. [117, 118, 125, 131, 132] obtained improved \u0393n /\u0393p ratios as well\nas realistic total rates. Recent calculations showed the importance of both the K\u2013\nmeson\u2013exchange and the direct quark mechanism [118, 125, 131] for a considerable\nimprovement of \u0393n /\u0393p . On the other hand, the mesonic widths are well explained by\nthe proposed models.\n\n47\n\n\f5\n5.1\n\nModels for calculation\nIntroduction\n\nIn this section we present the frameworks utilized in the literature for the formal\nderivation of \u039b decay rates in nuclei. In subsections 5.2 and 5.3 we discuss the general features of the approach used for direct finite nucleus calculations. It is usually\ncalled Wave Function Method (WFM) and it has been employed by large part of\nthe authors [108, 109, 118, 120, 123, 131]. This method makes use of shell model nuclear and hypernuclear wave functions (both at hadronic and quark level) as well as\npion wave functions generated by pion\u2013nucleus optical potentials. In subsection 5.4\nthe Polarization Propagator Method (PPM), applied for the first time to hypernuclear decay in Ref. [163] and subsequently in Refs. [125, 164\u2013168], is summarized. We\nshall see how the decay widths can be evaluated, in nuclear matter, by means of a\nmany\u2013body description of the hyperon self\u2013energy. The Local Density Approximation (LDA) allows then one to implement the calculation in finite nuclei. Finally a\nmicroscopic approach, based again on the PPM, is presented in subsection 5.5: here\nthe Feynman diagrams contributing to the \u039b self\u2013energy are classified by means of a\nfunctional integral approach, according to the prescriptions of the so\u2013called bosonic\nloop expansion.\nThe numerical results of the literature obtained with WFM and PPM calculations\nhave already been discussed in the previous section. Those obtained by the authors\nof the present review by applying the formalism of subsections 5.4, 5.5 are the subject\nof subsections 5.6, 5.7.\n\n5.2\n\nWave Function Method: mesonic decay\n\nThe weak effective Hamiltonian for the \u039b \u2192 \u03c0N decay can be parameterized in the\nform:\nW\n~ \u03c0 \u03c8\u039b ,\nH\u039b\u03c0N\n= iGm2\u03c0 \u03c8 N (A + B\u03b35 )~\u03c4 * \u03c6\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the values of the weak coupling constants G = 2.211 * 10\u22127 /m2\u03c0 , A = 1.06\nand B = \u22127.10 are fixed on the free \u039b decay. The constants A and B determine\nthe strengths of the parity violating and parity conserving \u039b \u2192 \u03c0N amplitudes,\nfree\nrespectively. In order to enforce the \u2206I = 1/2 rule (which fixes \u0393free\n\u03c0 \u2212 /\u0393\u03c0 0 = 2), in\nEq. (5) the hyperon is assumed to be an isospin spurion with I = 1/2, Iz = \u22121/2.\nfree\nfree\nIn the non\u2013relativistic approximation, the free \u039b decay width \u0393free\n\u039b = \u0393\u03c0 \u2212 + \u0393\u03c0 0\nis given by:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nP2 2\nd~q\n2\nfree\n2 2\n2\u03c0 \u03b4[m\u039b \u2212 \u03c9(~q) \u2212 EN ] S + 2 q~ ,\n\u0393\u03b1 = c\u03b1 (Gm\u03c0 )\n(2\u03c0)3 2\u03c9(~q)\nm\u03c0\nwhere c\u03b1 = 1 for \u0393\u03c00 and c\u03b1 = 2 for \u0393\u03c0\u2212 (expressing the \u2206I = 1/2 rule), S = A,\nP = m\u03c0 B/(2mN ), whereas EN and \u03c9(~q) are the total energies of nucleon and pion,\nrespectively. One then easily finds the well known result:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nP2 2\nfree\n2 2 1 mN qc.m.\n2\n\u0393\u03b1 = c\u03b1 (Gm\u03c0 )\nS + 2 qc.m. ,\n2\u03c0 m\u039b\nm\u03c0\n48\n\n\fwhich reproduces the observed rates. In the previous equation, qc.m. \u2243 100 MeV is\nthe pion momentum in the center\u2013of\u2013mass frame.\nIn a finite nucleus approach, the mesonic width \u0393M = \u0393\u03c0\u2212 + \u0393\u03c00 is calculable by\nmeans of the following formula:\nXZ\nd~q\n2 2\n\u0393\u03b1 = c\u03b1 (Gm\u03c0 )\n2\u03c0 \u03b4[E\u039b \u2212 \u03c9(~q) \u2212 EN ]\n3\n(2\u03c0) 2\u03c9(~q)\nN/\n\u2208F\n)\n(\nZ\nZ\n2\n2\nP2\n\u2217\n2\n\u2217\n~ \u03c6\u03c0 (~q, ~r)\u03c6N (~r)\nd~r\u03c6\u039b (~r)\u03c6\u03c0 (~q, ~r)\u03c6N (~r) + 2\n,\n\u00d7 S\nd~r\u03c6\u039b (~r)\u25bd\nm\u03c0\nwhere the sum runs over non\u2013occupied nucleonic states, and E\u039b is the hyperon total\nenergy. The \u039b and nucleon wave functions \u03c6\u039b and \u03c6N are obtainable within a shell\nmodel. The pion wave function \u03c6\u03c0 corresponds to an outgoing wave, solution of the\nKlein\u2013Gordon equation with proper pion\u2013nucleus optical potential Vopt :\n\b 2\n~ \u2212 m2\u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c9Vopt (~r) + [\u03c9 \u2212 VC (~r)]2 \u03c6\u03c0 (~q, ~r) = 0,\n\u25bd\nwhere VC (~r) is the nuclear Coulomb potential and the energy eigenvalue \u03c9 depends\non ~q.\nDifferent calculations [108\u2013110] have shown how strongly the mesonic decay is\nsensitive to the pion\u2013nucleus optical potential, which can be parameterized in terms\nof the nuclear density, as discussed in Refs. [109, 110], or evaluated microscopically,\nas in Ref. [108].\n\n5.3\n\nWave Function Method: non\u2013mesonic decay\n\nWithin the meson\u2013exchange\u2013mechanism, the weak transition \u039bN \u2192 NN is assumed\nto proceed via the mediation of virtual mesons of the pseudoscalar (\u03c0, \u03b7 and K) and\nvector (\u03c1, \u03c9 and K \u2217 ) octets [118, 120, 123, 131] (see Fig 5). Two\u2013pion\u2013exchange has\nbeen considered in the literature as well [117, 124, 159, 161].\nThe fundamental ingredients for the calculation of the \u039bN \u2192 NN transition\nwithin a OME model are the weak and strong hadronic vertices. The \u039b\u03c0N weak\nHamiltonian is given in Eq. (5). For the strong NN\u03c0 Hamiltonian one has the usual\npseudoscalar coupling:\nS\n~ \u03c0 \u03c8N ,\nHN\n\u03c4 *\u03c6\nN \u03c0 = igN N \u03c0 \u03c8 N \u03b35~\n\ngN N \u03c0 being the strong coupling constant for the NN\u03c0 vertex. In momentum space,\nthe non\u2013relativistic transition potential in the OPE approximation is then:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nB\n~\u03c32 * ~q\n2 gN N \u03c0\nV\u03c0 (~q) = \u2212Gm\u03c0\nA+\n~\u03c31 * ~q\n~\u03c41 * ~\u03c42 ,\n2\n2mN\n2m\u0304\n~q + m2\u03c0\nwhere m\u0304 = (m\u039b + mN )/2 and ~q is the momentum of the exchanged pion (directed\ntowards the strong vertex), whose static free propagator is \u2212(~q2 + m2\u03c0 )\u22121 . One can\nignore relativistic effects and use for calculations the above non\u2013relativistic potential [114].\n49\n\n\fGiven the large momentum (\u2243 420 MeV) exchanged in the \u039bN \u2192 NN transition,\nthe OPE mechanism describes the long range part of the interaction, and more massive mesons are expected to contribute at shorter distances. A difficulty appears when\none wants to include other mesons in the exchange potential. In fact, for mesons m\nother than the pion, the weak and strong vertices \u039bNm and NNm are experimentally\nunknown; moreover, their theoretical evaluation resulted quite model\u2013dependent, as\nexplained in the previous section. For example, if one includes in the calculation the\ncontribution of the \u03c1\u2013meson, the weak \u039bN\u03c1 and strong NN\u03c1 Hamiltonians:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd q\u03bd\n\u03bc\nW\n2\n\u03bc\nH\u039bN \u03c1 = Gm\u03c0 \u03c8 N \u03b1\u03b3 \u2212 i\u03b2\n+ \u01eb\u03b3 \u03b35 ~\u03c4 * \u03c1~\u03bc \u03c8\u039b ,\n2m\u0304\n!\nT\ng\nN\nN\n\u03c1\nV\n\u03bc\nS\n\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd q\u03bd ~\u03c4 * \u03c1~\u03bc \u03c8N ,\ngN\nHN\nN \u03c1\u03b3 + i\nN \u03c1 = \u03c8N\n2m\u0304\nare needed [120]. They give the following \u03c1\u2013meson transition potential:\n\"\nV\nT\n(\u03b1 + \u03b2)(gN\nN \u03c1 + gN N \u03c1 )\nV\n(~\u03c31 \u00d7 q~) * (~\u03c32 \u00d7 ~q)\n\u03b1\n\u2212\nV\u03c1 (~q) = Gm2\u03c0 gN\nN\u03c1\n4mn m\n#\nV\nT\n\u01eb(gN\n+\ng\n)\n~\u03c41 * ~\u03c42\nN\u03c1\nNN\u03c1\n+i\n,\n(~\u03c31 \u00d7 ~\u03c32 ) * ~q 2\n2mm\n~q + m2\u03c1\nwhere the weak coupling constants \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u01eb must be evaluated theoretically.\nThe potential for a OME calculation accounting for the exchange of pseudoscalar\nand vector mesons can be expressed through the following decomposition:\nX\nXX\nV (~r) =\nVm (~r) =\nVm\u03b1 (r)\u00d4 \u03b1(~\u02c6r )I\u02c6m ,\n(6)\nm\n\nm\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere m = \u03c0, \u03c1, K, K \u2217 , \u03c9, \u03b7; the spin operators \u00d4 \u03b1 are (PV stands for parity\u2013\nviolating):\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n1\u0302\ncentral spin\u2013independent,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ncentral spin\u2013dependent ,\n\uf8f2~\u03c31 * ~\u03c32\n\u03b1 \u02c6\n\u00d4 (~r) = S12 (~\u02c6r) = 3(~\u03c31 * ~\u02c6r )(~\u03c32 * ~\u02c6r ) \u2212 ~\u03c31 * ~\u03c32 tensor,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n~\u03c32 * ~\u02c6r\nPV for pseudoscalar mesons,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3(~\u03c3 \u00d7 ~\u03c3 ) * ~\u02c6r\nPV for vector mesons,\n1\n2\n\nwhereas the isospin operators I\u02c6m are:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f21\u0302\n\u02c6\nIm = ~\u03c41 * ~\u03c42\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nlinear combination of 1\u0302 and ~\u03c41 * ~\u03c42\n\nisoscalars mesons (\u03b7, \u03c9),\nisovector mesons (\u03c0, \u03c1),\nisodoublet mesons (K, K \u2217 ).\n\nFor details concerning the potential (6), see Refs.

Customarily, in shell\nmodel calculations the weak\u2013coupling scheme is used to describe the hypernuclear\nwave function \u03a8H , the nuclear core wave function being obtained through the technique of fractional parentage coefficients [120]. The many\u2013body transition amplitude\nM(~p1 , ~p2 ) is then expressed in terms of two\u2013body amplitudes hNN|V |\u039bNi of the\nOME potential of Eq. (6).\nSince the \u039b decays from an orbital angular momentum l = 0 state, in the non\u2013\nmesonic decay rate one can easily isolate the contributions of neutron\u2013 and proton\u2013\ninduced transitions [120], and the \u0393n /\u0393p ratio can be directly evaluated. The NN\nfinal state interactions and the \u039bN correlations (which are absent in an independent\nparticle shell model) can also be implemented in the calculation [118, 120, 131, 170].\n\n5.4\n\nPolarization Propagator Method and Local Density Approximation\n\nThe \u039b decay in nuclear systems can be studied by using the Polarization Propagator\nMethod [179], which is usually employed within the Random Phase Approximation\n(RPA). The calculation of the widths is performed in nuclear matter and then it is\nextended to finite nuclei via the LDA. This many\u2013body technique has been applied\nfor the first time to hypernuclear decays in Ref. [163]. It provides a unified picture\nof the different decay channels and it is equivalent to the WFM [180] (in the sense\nthat it is a semiclassical approximation of the exact quantum mechanical problem).\nFor the calculation of the mesonic rates the WFM is more reliable than the PPM in\nLDA, this channel being rather sensitive to the shell structure of the hypernucleus,\ndue to the small energies involved. In general it is advisable to avoid the use of the\nLDA to describe very light systems. On the other hand, the propagator method in\nLDA offers the possibility of calculations over a broad range of mass numbers, while\nthe WFM is hardly exploitable for medium and heavy hypernuclei.\n51\n\n\f\u039b\n\nk\n\nk-q\n\nq\n\nN\n\n\u03c0\nk\n\n\u039b\n\nFigure 7: \u039b self energy in nuclear matter.\n\n5.4.1\n\nNuclear matter\n\nTo calculate the \u039b width one needs the imaginary part of the \u039b self\u2013energy:\n\u0393\u039b = \u22122 Im \u03a3\u039b .\n\n(8)\n\nBy using the customary Feynman rules, from Fig. 7 the \u039b self\u2013energy in the non\u2013\nrelativistic limit is obtained as:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nP2 2\nd4 q\n2\n2 2\nF\u03c02 (q)GN (k \u2212 q)G\u03c0 (q),\n(9)\nS + 2 ~q\n\u03a3\u039b (k) = 3i(Gm\u03c0 )\n(2\u03c0)4\nm\u03c0\nthe factor 3 being a consequence of the \u2206I = 1/2 rule.

The meaning\nof the various diagrams is explained in the text.\n\nwhich is normalized to unity for on\u2013shell pions. Since at present there is no reason\nto introduce a different form factor in the weak vertex, one utilizes here the same\nexpression usually employed for the \u03c0NN strong vertex. For instance, in the pole\ndominance description of the parity\u2013conserving weak vertex, a form factor identical\nto the strong one is assigned. From empirical studies on the NN interaction it follows\nthat \u039b\u03c0N N \u2243 1.3 GeV, and the same value can be used for \u03c0\u039bN. We note here that\nthe parity\u2013conserving term (l = 1 term) in Eq. (9) contributes only about 12% of the\ntotal free decay width. However, the P \u2013wave interaction becomes dominant in the\nnuclear non\u2013mesonic decay, because of the larger exchanged momenta.\nIn Fig. 8 we show the lowest order Feynman diagrams for the \u039b self\u2013energy in\nnuclear matter. Diagram (a) represents the bare self\u2013energy term, including the\neffects of the Pauli principle and of binding on the intermediate nucleon. In (b) and\n(c) the pion couples to a particle\u2013hole (p\u2013h) and a \u2206\u2013h pair, respectively. Diagram\n(d) is an insertion of S\u2013wave pion self\u2013energy at lowest order. In diagram (e) we\nshow a 2p\u20132h excitation coupled to the pion through S\u2013wave \u03c0N interactions. Other\n2p\u20132h excitations, coupled in P \u2013wave, are shown in (f) and (g), while (h) is a RPA\niteration of diagram (b).\nIn Eq. (9) there are two different sources of imaginary part. The analytical struc53\n\n\fture of the integrand allows the integration over q0 [163]. After performing this\nintegration, an imaginary part is obtained from the (renormalized) pion\u2013nucleon pole\nand physically corresponds to the mesonic decay of the hyperon. Moreover, the pion\nproper self\u2013energy \u03a3\u2217\u03c0 (q) has an imaginary part itself for (q0 , ~q) values which correspond to the excitation of p\u2013h, \u2206\u2013h, 2p\u20132h, etc states on the mass shell. By expanding\nthe pion propagator G\u03c0 (q) as in Fig. 8 and integrating Eq. (9) over q0 , the nuclear\nmatter \u039b decay width of Eq. (8) becomes [163]:\nZ\nd~q\n2\n2\n\u0393\u039b (~k, \u03c1) = \u22126(Gm\u03c0 )\n\u03b8(| ~k \u2212 ~q | \u2212kF )\u03b8(k0 \u2212 EN (~k \u2212 q~) \u2212 VN )\n(2\u03c0)3\n\u00d7Im [\u03b1(q)]q0 =k0 \u2212EN (~k\u2212~q)\u2212VN ,\n(12)\nwhere:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nS\u0303 2 (q)UL (q)\nP2 2\n2\n\u03b1(q) =\nS + 2 q~ F\u03c02 (q)G0\u03c0 (q) +\nm\u03c0\n1 \u2212 VL (q)UL (q)\nP\u0303L2 (q)UL (q)\nP\u0303T2 (q)UT (q)\n+\n+2\n.\n1 \u2212 VL (q)UL (q)\n1 \u2212 VT (q)UT (q)\n\n(13)\n\nIn Eq. (12) the first \u03b8 function forbids intermediate nucleon momenta smaller than\nthe Fermi momentum (see Fig. 7), while the second one requires the pion energy q0 to\nbe positive. Moreover, the \u039b energy, k0 = E\u039b (~k) + V\u039b , contains a phenomenological\nbinding term. With the exception of diagram (a), the pion lines of Fig. 8 have been\nreplaced, in Eq. (13), by the effective interactions S\u0303, P\u0303L , P\u0303T ,VL , VT (L and T stand\nfor spin\u2013longitudinal and spin\u2013transverse, respectively), which include \u03c0\u2013 and \u03c1\u2013\nexchange modulated by the effect of short range repulsive correlations. The potentials\nVL and VT represent the (strong) p\u2013h interaction and include a Landau parameter\ng \u2032, which accounts for the short range repulsion, while S\u0303, P\u0303L and P\u0303T correspond to\nthe lines connecting weak and strong hadronic vertices and contain another Landau\nparameter, g\u039b\u2032 , which is related to the strong \u039bN short range correlations. For details\non these potentials see appendix A. Furthermore, in Eq. (13):\nG0\u03c0 (q) =\n\n1\nq02\n\n\u2212 ~q 2 \u2212 m2\u03c0\n\n,\n\nis the free pion propagator, while UL (q) and UT (q) contain the Lindhard functions for\np\u2013h and \u2206-h excitations [182] and also account for the irreducible 2p\u20132h polarization\npropagator:\n2p2h\nUL,T (q) = U ph (q) + U \u2206h (q) + UL,T\n(q).\n\n(14)\n\nThey appear in Eq. (13) within the standard RPA expression. The decay width\n(12) depends both explicitly and through UL,T (q) on the nuclear matter density \u03c1 =\n2kF3 /3\u03c0 2 . The Lindhard function for the p\u2013h excitation is defined by [182]:\nZ\nd4 p 0\nph\nG (p)G0N (p + q),\nU (q) = \u22124i\n(2\u03c0)3 N\n54\n\n\fwhere:\nG0N (p) =\n\n\u03b8(kF \u2212 | p~ |)\n\u03b8(| p~ | \u2212kF )\n+\n,\np0 \u2212 TN (~p) + i\u01eb p0 \u2212 TN (~p) \u2212 i\u01eb\n\nis the free nucleon propagator. In the above equation, TN is the nucleon kinetic energy.\nThe Lindhard function U \u2206h is obtained from U ph by replacing the p\u2013h propagators\nwith the \u2206\u2013h ones. Analytical expressions of U ph and U \u2206h are given in Refs. [54, 182].\n2p2h\nFor the evaluation of UL,T\nwe discuss two different approaches. In Refs. [165,\n166] a phenomenological parameterization was adopted: as we shall see in paragraph\n2p2h\n5.4.3, this consists in relating UL,T\nto the available phase space for on\u2013shell 2p\u20132h\nexcitations in order to extrapolate for off\u2013mass shell pions the experimental data of P \u2013\nwave absorption of real pions in pionic atoms. In an alternative approach [167], as we\n2p2h\nshall discuss in detail in subsection 5.5, UL,T\nis evaluated microscopically, starting\nfrom a classification of the relevant Feynman diagrams according to the so\u2013called\nbosonic loop expansion, which will be obtained by means of a functional approach.\nIn the spin\u2013longitudinal channel, U(q) is related to the P \u2013wave pion proper self\u2013\nenergy through:\nf\u03c02 2\nF (q)UL (q)\nm2\u03c0 \u03c0\n(P ) \u2217\n\u03a3\u03c0 (q) =\n,\nf\u03c02\n1 \u2212 2 gL (q)UL (q)\nm\u03c0\n~q 2\n\nwhere the Landau function gL (q) is given in appendix A. The full pion (proper)\nself\u2013energy:\n)\u2217\n\u03a3\u2217\u03c0 (q) = \u03a3\u03c0(S) \u2217 (q) + \u03a3(P\n(q),\n\u03c0\n\nalso contains an S\u2013wave term, which, by using the parameterization of Ref. [183], can\nbe written as:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm\u03c0\n(S) \u2217\n\u03a3\u03c0 (q) = \u22124\u03c0 1 +\nb0 \u03c1,\nmN\n(S) \u2217\n\nwith b0 = \u22120.0285/m\u03c0 . The function \u03a3\u03c0\nis real (constant and positive), therefore it contributes only to the mesonic decay [diagram (d) in Fig. 8 is the relative\nlowest order]. On the contrary, the P \u2013wave self\u2013energy is complex and attractive:\n(P ) \u2217\nRe \u03a3\u03c0 (q) < 0.\nThe propagator method provides a unified picture of the decay widths. A non\u2013\nvanishing imaginary part in a self\u2013energy diagram requires placing simultaneously\non\u2013shell the particles of the considered intermediate state. For instance, diagram (b)\nin Fig. 8 has two sources of imaginary part. One comes from cut 1, where the nucleon\nand the pion are placed on\u2013shell. This term contributes to the mesonic channel: the\nfinal pion eventually interacts with the medium through a p\u2013h excitation and then\nescapes from the nucleus. Diagram (b) and further iterations lead to a renormalization\nof the pion in the medium which may increase the mesonic rate even by one or two\norders of magnitude in heavy nuclei [108, 109, 163]. The cut 2 in Fig. 8(b) places a\n55\n\n\fnucleon and a p\u2013h pair on shell, so it is the lowest order contribution to the physical\nprocess \u039bN \u2192 NN; analogous considerations apply to all the considered diagrams.\nIn order to evaluate the various contributions to the width stemming from Eq. (12),\nit is convenient to consider all the intervening free meson propagators as real. Then\nthe imaginary part of (13) will develop the following contributions:\n2p2h\nIm U ph (q) + Im U \u2206h (q) + Im UL,T\n(q)\nUL,T (q)\nIm\n=\n.\n2\n1 \u2212 VL,T (q)UL,T (q)\n| 1 \u2212 VL,T (q)UL,T (q) |\n\n(15)\n\nThe three terms in the numerator of Eq. (15) can be interpreted as different decay\nmechanisms of the hypernucleus. The term proportional to Im U ph provides the one\u2013\nnucleon induced non\u2013mesonic rate, \u03931 . There is no overlap between Im U ph (q) and\nthe pole q0 = \u03c9(~q) in the (dressed) pion propagator G\u03c0 (q): thus the separation of the\nmesonic and one\u2013body stimulated non\u2013mesonic channels is unambiguous.\nFurther, Im U \u2206h accounts for the \u2206 \u2192 \u03c0N decay width, thus representing a\ncontribution to the mesonic decay.\n2p2h\nThe third contribution of Eq. (15), proportional to Im UL,T\n, intervenes in a wide\nkinematical range, in which the above mentioned cuts put on the mass shell not only\nthe 2p\u20132h lines, but possibly also the pionic line. Indeed the renormalized pion pole\nin Eq. (11) is given by the dispersion relation:\n\u03c9 2 (~q) \u2212 ~q 2 \u2212 m2\u03c0 \u2212 Re \u03a3\u2217\u03c0 [\u03c9(~q), ~q ] = 0,\nwith the constraint:\n\u03c9(~q) = k0 \u2212 EN (~k \u2212 ~q) \u2212 VN .\n2p2h\nAt the pion pole, Im UL,T\n6= 0, thus the two\u2013body induced non\u2013mesonic width, \u03932 ,\ncannot be disentangled from the mesonic width, \u0393M . In other words, part of the\n2p2h\ndecay rate calculated from Im UL,T\nis due to the excitations of the renormalized pion\nand gives in fact \u0393M , with the exception of the mesonic contribution originating from\nIm U \u2206h , which is, however, only a small fraction of \u0393M . In order to separate \u0393M from\n\u03932 , in the numerical calculation it is convenient to evaluate the mesonic width by\nadopting the following prescription. We start from Eq. (12), setting:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nP2 2\n2\n\u03b1(q) = \u03b1M (q) \u2261 S + 2 ~q\nF\u03c02 (q)G\u03c0 (q),\n(16)\nm\u03c0\n2p2h\nand omitting Im \u03a3\u2217\u03c0 in G\u03c0 (which corresponds to set Im U ph = Im U \u2206h = Im UL,T\n=\n0). Then Im \u03b1M (q) only accounts for the (real) contribution of the pion pole:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nIm G\u03c0 (q) = \u2212\u03c0\u03b4 q02 \u2212 ~q 2 \u2212 m2\u03c0 \u2212 Re \u03a3\u2217\u03c0 (q) .\n\nWe notice that the compact relation (16) between \u03b1(q) and the pion propagator is\nvalid only for the calculation of the mesonic decay mode. In fact in this case the\nfollowing substitutions must be performed in Eq. (13) (see also appendix A):\nf\u03c0\nSF 2 (q)G0\u03c0 (q) | ~q |,\nm\u03c0 \u03c0\nf\u03c0 P 2 2\n~q F\u03c0 (q)G0\u03c0 (q),\nP\u0303L (p) \u2192\nm\u03c0 m\u03c0\nP\u0303T (p) \u2192 0,\n\nS\u0303(p)\n\n\u2192\n\n56\n\n\fand hence the various terms in \u03b1(q) can be combined to give the expression (16).\nObviously this implies that no correlation other than the pion is active between the\n\u039b and the strong vertices (g\u039b\u2032 = 0).\nOnce the mesonic decay rate is known, one can calculate the three\u2013body non\u2013\nmesonic rate by subtracting \u0393M and \u03931 from the total rate \u0393T , which one gets via the\nfull expression for \u03b1(q) [Eq. (13)].\n5.4.2\n\nFinite nuclei\n\nUsing the Polarization Propagator approach, the decay widths in finite nuclei are obtained from the ones evaluated in nuclear matter via the LDA: the Fermi momentum\nis made r\u2013dependent (namely a local Fermi sea of nucleons is introduced) and related\nto the nuclear density by the same relation which holds in nuclear matter:\nkF (~r) =\n\n\u001a\n\n3 2\n\u03c0 \u03c1(~r)\n2\n\n\u001b1/3\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nMoreover, the nucleon binding potential VN also becomes r\u2013dependent in LDA. In\nThomas\u2013Fermi approximation one assumes:\n\u01ebF (~r) + VN (~r) \u2261\n\nkF2 (~r)\n+ VN (~r) = 0.\n2mN\n\nFor the \u039b binding energy, V\u039b , the experimental values [37, 38] can be used. With\nthese prescriptions one can then evaluate the decay width in finite nuclei by using the\nsemiclassical approximation, through the relation:\nZ\nh\ni\n~\n\u0393\u039b (k) = d~r |\u03c8\u039b (~r)|2 \u0393\u039b ~k, \u03c1(~r) ,\n(18)\nh\ni\nwhere \u03c8\u039b is the appropriate \u039b wave function and \u0393\u039b ~k, \u03c1(~r) is given by Eqs. (12),\n(13). This decay rate can be regarded as the ~k\u2013component of the \u039b decay rate in the\nnucleus with density \u03c1(~r). It can be used to estimate the decay rates by averaging\nover the \u039b momentum distribution |\u03c8\u0303\u039b (~k)|2 . One then obtains the following total\nwidth:\nZ\n\u0393\u039b = d~k |\u03c8\u0303\u039b (~k)|2 \u0393\u039b (~k),\n(19)\nwhich can be compared with the experimental results.\n5.4.3\n\nPhenomenological 2p\u20132h propagator\n\nComing to the phenomenological evaluation of the 2p\u20132h contributions in the \u039b self\u2013\nenergy, we recall that the authors of Ref. [165] employed the following equation for\n2p2h\nthe imaginary part of UL,T\n:\n2p2h\nIm UL,T\n(q0 , ~q; \u03c1) =\n\nP (q0 , ~q; \u03c1)\n2p2h\nIm UL,T\n(m\u03c0 , ~0; \u03c1eff ),\n~\nP (m\u03c0 , 0; \u03c1eff )\n57\n\n(20)\n\n\fwhere \u03c1eff = 0.75\u03c1. By neglecting the energy and momentum dependence of the p\u2013h\ninteraction, the phase space available for on\u2013shell 2p\u20132h excitations [calculated, for\nsimplicity, from diagram 8(e)] at energy\u2013momentum (q0 , ~q) and density \u03c1 turns out\nto be:\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\nd4 k\nph q\nph q\nP (q0 , ~q; \u03c1) \u221d\nIm U\n+ k; \u03c1 Im U\n\u2212 k; \u03c1\n(2\u03c0)4\n2\n2\n\u0011 \u0010q\n\u0011\n\u0010q\n0\n0\n+ k0 \u03b8\n\u2212 k0 .\n\u00d7\u03b8\n2\n2\n\nIn the region of (q0 , ~q) where the p\u2013h and \u2206\u2013h excitations are off\u2013shell, the relation\nbetween UL2p2h and the P \u2013wave pion\u2013nucleus optical potential Vopt is given by:\nf\u03c02 2\nF\u03c0 (q)UL2p2h (q)\n2\nm\u03c0\n= 2q0 Vopt (q);\nf\u03c02\n1 \u2212 2 gL (q)UL (q)\nm\u03c0\n\n~q 2\n\n(21)\n\nat the pion threshold Vopt is usually parameterized as:\n2q0 Vopt (q0 \u2243 m\u03c0 , ~q \u2243 ~0; \u03c1) = \u22124\u03c0~q 2 \u03c12 C0 ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere C0 is a complex number which can be extracted from experimental data on pionic atoms. By combining Eqs. (21) and (22) it is possible to parameterize the proper\n2p\u20132h excitations in the spin\u2013longitudinal channel through Eq. (20), by setting:\nq~ 2\n\nf\u03c02 2\nF (q0 \u2243 m\u03c0 , ~q \u2243 ~0)UL2p2h (q0 \u2243 m\u03c0 , ~q \u2243 ~0; \u03c1) = \u22124\u03c0~q 2 \u03c12 C0\u2217 .\nm2\u03c0 \u03c0\n\n(23)\n\nThe value of C0\u2217 also depends on the correlation function gL . From the analysis of\npionic atoms data made in Ref. [184] and taking g \u2032 \u2261 gL (0) = 0.615, one obtains:\nC0\u2217 = (0.105 + i0.096)/m6\u03c0 .\nThe spin\u2013transverse component of U 2p2h is assumed to be equal to the spin\u2013\nlongitudinal one, UT2p2h = UL2p2h , and the real parts of UL2p2h and UT2p2h are considered\nconstant [by using Eq. (23)] because they are not expected to be too sensitive to\nvariations of q0 and ~q. The assumption UT2p2h = UL2p2h is not a priori a good approximation, but it is the only one which can be employed in the present phenomenological\ndescription. Yet, the differences between UL2p2h and UT2p2h (which will be discussed in\nsubsection 5.7; see, in particular, figure 16) can only mildly change the partial decay\n2p2h\nwidths: in fact, UL,T\nare summed to U ph , which gives the dominant contribution.\nMoreover, for UL2p2h = UT2p2h the transverse contribution to \u03932 [fourth term in the\nright hand side of Eq. (13)] is only about 16% of \u03932 (namely 2 \u00f7 3% of the total\nwidth) in medium\u2013heavy hypernuclei.\n\n5.5\n\nFunctional approach to the \u039b self\u2013energy\n\nIn alternative to the above mentioned phenomenological approach for the two\u2013body\ninduced decay, we discuss here a microscopic approach. In particular, we will show\n58\n\n\fhow the most relevant Feynman diagrams for the calculation of the \u039b self\u2013energy can\nbe obtained in the framework of a functional method: following Ref. [167] we will\nshortly derive a classification of the diagrams according to the prescription of the\nso\u2013called bosonic loop expansion (BLE).\nThe baryon\u2013baryon strong interactions cannot be treated with the standard perturbative method. Indeed, in the study of nuclear phenomena we always need to\nsum, up to infinite order, the series of pertinent diagrams. For instance, one usually\nperforms the summation of the infinite classes of diagrams entailed by the RPA and\nDyson equations. However, in the above quoted schemes no prescription is given to\nevaluate the \"next\u2013to\u2013leading\" order.\nThe functional techniques can provide a theoretically founded derivation of new\nclasses of expansion in terms of powers of suitably chosen parameters. On the other\nhand, as we will see, the ring approximation (a subclass of RPA) automatically appears in this framework at the mean field level. This method has been extensively\napplied to the analysis of different processes in nuclear physics [185\u2013187]. Here it will\nbe employed for the calculation of the \u039b decay rates in nuclear matter, which can\nbe expressed through the nuclear responses to pseudoscalar\u2013isovector and vector\u2013\nisovector fields. The polarization propagators obtained in this framework include\nring\u2013dressed meson propagators (which represent the mean field level of the theory)\nand almost the whole spectrum of 2p\u20132h excitations (expressed in terms of a one\u2013loop\nexpansion with respect to the ring\u2013dressed meson propagators), which are required for\nthe evaluation of \u03932 . Actually, the semiclassical expansion leads to the prescription\nof grouping the relevant Feynman diagrams in a consistent many\u2013body description\nof the \"in medium\" meson self\u2013energies: the general theorems and sum rules of the\ntheory are preserved.\nLet us first consider the polarization propagator in the pionic (spin\u2013longitudinal)\nchannel. In order to exemplify, it is useful to start from a Lagrangian describing a\nsystem of nucleons interacting with pions through a pseudoscalar\u2013isovector coupling:\n1 ~ \u03bc~ 1 2 ~ 2\n~\nL\u03c0N = \u03c8(i/\u2202 \u2212 mN )\u03c8 + \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\n* \u2202 \u03c6 \u2212 m\u03c0 \u03c6 \u2212 i\u03c8~\u0393\u03c8 * \u03c6,\n2\n2\n~ is the nucleonic (pionic) field, and:\nwhere \u03c8 (\u03c6)\n~\u0393 = g\u03b35~\u03c4\n(g = 2f\u03c0 mN /m\u03c0 ) is the spin\u2013isospin matrix in the spin\u2013longitudinal isovector channel.\nWe remind the reader that in the calculation of the hypernuclear decay rates one\nalso needs the polarization propagator in the transverse channel [see Eqs. (12) and\n(13)]: hence, we will have to include in the model another mesonic degree of freedom,\nthe \u03c1 meson. This is relatively straightforward, since the semiclassical expansion is\ncharacterized by the topology of the diagrams, so the same scheme can be easily\napplied to mesonic fields other than the pionic one. In this subsection we present a\nrelativistic formalism, its non\u2013relativistic reduction being trivial.\nLet us now introduce a classical external field \u03c6\n~ with the quantum numbers of the\npion. The Lagrangian then becomes:\n~.\nL\u03c0N \u2192 L\u03c0N \u2212 i\u03c8~\u0393\u03c8 * \u03c6\n59\n\n\fThe corresponding generating functional in terms of Feynman path integrals has the\nform:\n\u001a Z\nZ\ni\u001b\nh\ni\nh\n~ exp i dx L\u03c0N (x) \u2212 i\u03c8(x)~\u0393\u03c8(x) * \u03c6\n~ (x)\n(24)\nZ[~\n\u03c6 ] = D \u03c8, \u03c8, \u03c6\n\n(here and in the following the coordinate integrals are 4\u2013dimensional). All the fields\nin the functional integrals have to be considered as classical variables, but with the\ncorrect commuting properties (hence the fermionic fields are Grassman variables).\nThe physical quantities of interest for the problem are deduced from the generating\nfunctional by means of functional differentiations. In particular, by introducing a new\nfunctional Zc such that:\nZ[~\n\u03c6 ] = exp {iZc [~\n\u03c6 ]},\n\n(25)\n\nthe spin\u2013longitudinal, isovector polarization propagator turns out to be the second\nfunctional derivative of Zc with respect to the source \u03c6\n~ of the pionic field:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\n\u03b4 Zc [~\n\u03c6]\n\u03a0ij (x, y) = \u2212\n.\n(26)\n\u03b4\u03c6i (x)\u03b4\u03c6j (y) \u03c6~ =0\nWe notice that the use of Zc instead of Z in Eq. (26) amounts to cancel the disconnected diagrams of the corresponding perturbative expansion (linked cluster theorem). From the generating functional Z one can obtain different approximation\nschemes according to the order in which the functional integrations are performed.\nBy integrating Eq. (24) over the mesonic degrees of freedom first, the generating\nF\nfunctional can be written in terms of a fermionic effective action Seff\n.

The effective\naction (27) can then be utilized in the framework of ordinary perturbation theory and\ndoes not bring significant novelties with respect to the usual calculations; furthermore,\n~ 4,\nit cannot be correctly renormalized due to the absence of a term proportional to \u03c6\nwhich is needed to cancel the divergence of the 4\u2013points fermion loops.\n60\n\n\f5.5.1\n\nThe bosonic effective action\n\nAlternatively it is possible to eliminate, in Eq.

(41)\n~=\u03c6\n~ 0 , with \u03c6\n~ 0 given by the Eqs. (35),\nby G0\u03c0 ). Then, after calculating Eq. (41) for \u03c6\n(37), (42), we expand the logarithm up to \u03c6\n~ 2 and take the trace to the same order.\nThis is rather tedious, but, at the end, the derivation with respect to the external\nsource provides the following total polarization propagator:\n\u03a0ij (x, y) = \u03b4ij \u03a0(x, y),\n\nwhere:\nring\n\n\u03a0(x, y) = \u03a0\n\n(x, y) +\n\nX\n\nTr (\u0393k \u0393l )\n\nkl\n\n+\n\nX\n\nTr (\u0393k \u0393l )\n\nZkl\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n0\ndu dv Gring\n\u03c0 (u \u2212 v)\u03a0 (x, u, y, v)\n\n(43)\n\n\u0002 0\n\u0003\n0\ndu dv Gring\n\u03c0 (u \u2212 v) \u03a0 (x, u, v, y) + \u03a0 (x, y, v, u)\n\nring\n0\ndu dv dw ds Gring\n\u03c0 (u \u2212 w)G\u03c0 (v \u2212 s)\u03a0 (x, u, v)\nX\u0002\n\u0003\nTr (\u0393k \u0393l \u0393m \u0393n ) \u03a00 (y, w, s) + Tr (\u0393k \u0393l \u0393n \u0393m ) \u03a00 (y, s, w) .\n\u00d7\n\n+\n\nklmn\n\nB\nSeff\n\nh\ni\nh i\nring\nB ~0\n~\n\u03c6\nand Seff \u03c6 with\n\nWe remind the reader that the second derivative of\nh i\n~ ring \u03c6\n~ 0 given by Eq.

The approximation scheme\ndeveloped here is also referred to as bosonic loop expansion (BLE). The practical rule\nto classify the Feynman diagrams according to their order in the BLE is to reduce to\na point all its fermionic lines and to count the number of bosonic loops left out. In\nthis case the diagrams (b)\u2013(f) of Fig. 10 reduce to a one\u2013boson\u2013loop. Diagrams (b),\n(c), (d) can be represented by the loop (A) of Fig. 11, while (e) and (f) correspond\nto the loop (B) of the same figure.\nThe polarization propagator of Eq. (43) is the central result of this microscopic\napproach, which will be used in the calculation of the \u039b decay width in nuclear matter.\nNotice that the model can easily include the excitation of baryonic resonances, by\nreplacing the fermionic field with multiplets. The topology of the diagrams remains\nthe same as in Fig. 10 but, introducing for example the \u2206 resonance, each fermionic\nline represents either a nucleon or a \u2206, taking care of isospin conservation. One thus\nobtains 15 exchange, 14 self\u2013energy and 98 correlation diagrams (see Ref. [187] for\nthe whole diagrammology).\nMoreover, since the BLE is characterized by the topology of the diagrams, one\ncan include in the model additional mesonic degrees of freedom, together with phenomenological short range correlations. In particular, the extension to other spin\u2013\nisospin channels simply amounts to change the definition of the vertices \u0393i in Eq. (43)\nand the same occurs for the non\u2013relativistic reduction of the theory. Accordingly, for\nthe non\u2013relativistic pion\u2013exchange, \u0393i becomes (apart from the coupling constant)\n(~\u03c3 * ~q)\u03c4i , for the \u03c1\u2013exchange it reads (~\u03c3 \u00d7 ~q)k \u03c4i , k being a spatial index, and for\nthe \u03c9\u2013exchange \u0393i \u221d (~\u03c3 \u00d7 ~q)i . The exchange of \u03c9\u2013mesons is taken into account\nonly inside the one\u2013boson\u2013loop diagrams (b)\u2013(f) of Fig. 10, but not in the mesonic\nlines stemming from the \u039b decay vertex, where the considered exchanged meson is,\nnecessarily, of isovector nature (\u03c0 or \u03c1). Beyond \u03c0, \u03c1 and \u03c9 mesons, the present approach also contains (partly) the exchange of the scalar\u2013isoscalar \u03c3\u2013meson: indeed, in\nthe phenomenology of the Bonn NN potential [188], the latter is described through\nbox diagrams (which are contained in the correlation diagrams of Fig. 10), namely\nby the exchange of two pions with the simultaneous excitation of one or both the\nintermediate nucleons to a \u2206 resonance.\n67\n\n\fA further difficulty arises if one starts from a potential model rather then from\na Lagrangian containing bosons as true degrees of freedom. However this disease is\neasily overcome by means of a Hubbard\u2013Stratonovitch transformation, which enables\none to substitute a potential with a two\u2013body interaction between nucleons by a\nsuitably introduced auxiliary field. As an example, for a scalar\u2013isoscalar potential V ,\nthe relevant identity reads:\n\u001b\n\u001a Z\n\u221a\ni\nexp\ndx dy \u03c8(x)\u03c8(x)V (x \u2212 y)\u03c8(y)\u03c8(y) = det V\n2\n\u001a Z\n\u001b\nZ\nZ\ni\n\u22121\n\u00d7 D[\u03c3] exp\ndx dy \u03c3(x)V (x \u2212 y)\u03c3(y) + i dx \u03c8(x)\u03c8(x)\u03c3(x)\n,\n2\nwhere \u03c3 is the auxiliary field. Clearly, the previous derivation will remain valid,\nproviding one substitutes the inverse propagator of the auxiliary field with the inverse\npotential in the \"free\" part of the action.\nFinally, a relevant point for the feasibility of the calculations is that all fermion\nloops in Fig. 10 can be evaluated analytically [189], so that each diagram reduces to\na 3\u2013dimensional (numerical) integral.\nIn particular, the formalism can be applied to evaluate the functions UL,T of\nEq. (14), which are required in Eqs. (12), (13). In the one\u2013boson\u2013loop (OBL) approximation of Eq. (43) and Fig. 10 we have to replace Eq. (13) with:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nS\u0303 2 (q)U1 (q)\nP2 2\n2\nF\u03c02 (q)G0\u03c0 (q) +\n\u03b1(q) =\nS + 2 ~q\nm\u03c0\n1 \u2212 VL (q)U1 (q)\n\n(44)\n\nP\u0303L2 (q)U1 (q)\nP\u0303T2 (q)U1 (q)\n+2\n1 \u2212 VL (q)U1 (q)\n1 \u2212 VT (q)U1 (q)\nh\ni\n+ S\u0303 2 (q) + P\u0303L2 (q) ULOBL (q) + 2P\u0303T2 (q)UTOBL (q),\n\n+\n\nwhere\n\nU1 = U ph + U \u2206h ,\nOBL\nwhile UL,T\nare evaluated from the diagrams 10(b)\u201310(f) using the standard Feynman\nrules. The normalization of these functions is such that U ph (x, y) = 4\u03a00 (x, y), \u03a00\nbeing given by Eq. (32). One relevant difference between the OBL formula (44) and\nthe RPA expression of Eq. (13) lies in the fact that in the former, to be consistent\nOBL\nwith Eq. (43), the 2p\u20132h diagrams (which contribute to UL,T\n) are not RPA\u2013iterated.\n\n5.6\n\nResults of the phenomenological calculation\n\nWe shall illustrate here and in the following subsection the results which can be obtained for hypernuclear decay widths by employing the two approaches (phenomenological and microscopic) illustrated above.\nTo start with let us consider the PPM combined with the LDA: in order to evaluate\nthe width from Eqs. (18), (19) one needs to specify the nuclear density and the wave\nfunction for the \u039b. The former is assumed to be a Fermi distribution (normalized to\n\n68\n\n\fthe nuclear mass number A):\n\u03c1A (r) =\n\nA\n(\n\n\u0014\n\n4 3\n\u03c0a\n\u03c0R (A) 1 +\n3\nR(A)\n\n\u00152 ) \u001a\n\n1\n\u0015\u001b ,\nr \u2212 R(A)\n1 + exp\na\n\u0014\n\n(45)\n\nwith radius R(A) = 1.12A1/3 \u2212 0.86A\u22121/3 fm and thickness a = 0.52 fm. The \u039b wave\nfunction is obtained from a \u039b\u2013nucleus potential of Woods\u2013Saxon shape, with fixed\ndiffuseness and with radius and depth such that it exactly reproduces the first two\nsingle particle eigenvalues (s and p \u039b levels) of the hypernucleus under analysis.\n5.6.1\n\nShort range correlations and \u039b wave function \u2013\n\n12\n\u039bC\n\nA crucial ingredient in the calculation of the decay widths is the short range part of\nthe strong NN and \u039bN interactions. They are expressed by the functions gL,T (q)\n\u039b\nand gL,T\n(q) reported in appendix A and contain the Landau parameters g \u2032 and g\u039b\u2032 ,\nrespectively. No experimental information is available on g\u039b\u2032 , while many constraints\nhave been set on g \u2032 , for example by the well known quenching of the Gamow\u2013Teller\nresonance. Realistic values of g \u2032 within the framework of the ring approximation are\nin the range 0.6 \u00f7 0.7 [179]. However, in the present context g \u2032 correlates not only\np\u2013h pairs but also p\u2013h with 2p\u20132h states. In order to fix the correlation parameters\nin this new contest, in Ref. [166] the calculated non\u2013mesonic width of 12\n\u039b C has been\ncompared with the experimental one.\nIn Fig. 12 we see how the total non\u2013mesonic width for carbon depends on the\nLandau parameters. The rate decreases as g \u2032 increases. This characteristic is well\nestablished in RPA [see Eq. (13)]. Moreover, for fixed g \u2032 , there is a minimum for\ng\u039b\u2032 \u2243 0.4 (almost independent of the value of g \u2032 ). This is due to the fact that for\ng\u039b\u2032 \u226a 0.4 the longitudinal P \u2013wave contribution in Eq. (13) dominates over the transverse one and the opposite occurs for g\u039b\u2032 \u226b 0.4 (we also remind the reader that the\nS\u2013wave interaction [Eq. (93)] is independent of g\u039b\u2032 ). Moreover, the longitudinal P \u2013\nwave \u039bN \u2192 NN interaction [Eq. (91)] contains the pion exchange plus short range\ncorrelations, while the transverse P \u2013wave \u039bN \u2192 NN interaction [Eq. (92)] only\ncontains repulsive correlations, so with increasing g\u039b\u2032 the P \u2013wave longitudinal contribution to the width decreases, while the P \u2013wave transverse part increases. From\nFig. 12 we see that there is a broad range of choices of g \u2032 and g\u039b\u2032 values which fit\nfree\nthe \"experimental band\": \u0393exp\n= 0.94 \u00f7 1.07. The latter represents decay\nN M /\u0393\u039b\nwidths which are compatible with both the BNL [90] and KEK [98] experiments.\nOne should notice that the theoretical curves reported in Fig. 12 contain the contribution of the three\u2013body process \u039bNN \u2192 NNN; should the latter be neglected\n(ring approximation), then one could get equivalent results with g \u2032 values smaller\nthan the ones reported in the figure (typically \u2206g \u2032 \u2243 \u22120.1). The phenomenology of\nthe (e, e\u2032 ) quasi\u2013elastic scattering suggests, in ring approximation, g \u2032 values in the\nrange 0.6 \u00f7 0.7. Here, by taking into account also 2p\u20132h contributions, \"equivalent\"\ng \u2032 values larger than in ring approximation are used. From Fig. 12, the experimental band appears to be compatible with g \u2032 in the range 0.75 \u00f7 0.85 and g\u039b\u2032 in the\nrange 0.3 \u00f7 0.5. On the other hand, the new KEK results [99, 101, 171, 174] set an\nupper limit of about 1.03 for the non\u2013mesonic width, which practically forced us to\n69\n\n\fFigure 12: Dependence of the non\u2013mesonic width on the Landau parameters g \u2032 and\ng\u039b\u2032 for 12\n\u039b C.

Finally, from Fig. 12 we see that the values compatible with both these intervals (0.87 \u00f7 0.94) require g \u2032 = 0.85 \u00f7 0.90. This argument somewhat enlarges the\nabove considered experimental band of Fig. 12 (0.94 \u00f7 1.07) from below, giving a new\ninterval, 0.87 \u00f7 1.07, whose central value is reproduced by fixing g \u2032 = 0.8, g\u039b\u2032 = 0.4.\nUsing these values for the Landau parameters, we illustrate now the sensitivity of\nthe calculation of Ref. [166] to the \u039b wave function in 12\n\u039b C. In addition to the Woods\u2013\nSaxon potentials (New W\u2013S) that reproduces the s and p \u039b\u2013levels, other choices have\nalso been used. In particular: an harmonic oscillator wave function (H.O.) with an\n\"empirical\" frequency \u03c9 [37, 38], obtained from the s \u2212 p energy shift, the Woods\u2013\nSaxon wave function of Ref. [36] (Dover W\u2013S) and the microscopic wave function\n(Micr.) calculated, in Ref. [190], from a non\u2013local self\u2013energy using a realistic \u039bN\ninteraction. The results are shown (in units of the free \u039b width) in table 10, where they\nare compared with the experimental data from BNL [90] and KEK [98, 99, 171, 174].\nBy construction, the chosen g \u2032 and g\u039b\u2032 reproduce the experimental non\u2013mesonic width\nusing the W\u2013S wave function which gives the right s and p hyperon levels in 12\n\u039bC\n(column New W\u2013S). We note that it is possible to generate the microscopic wave\nfunction of Ref. [190] for carbon via a local hyperon\u2013nucleus W\u2013S potential with\nradius 2.92 fm and depth \u221223 MeV. Although this potential reproduces fairly well\nthe experimental s\u2013level for the \u039b in 12\n\u039b C, it does not reproduce the p\u2013level. A\ncompletely phenomenological \u039b\u2013nucleus potential, that can easily be extended to\nheavier nuclei and reproduces the experimental \u039b single particle levels as well as\npossible, has been preferably adopted in Ref. [166]. Except for s\u2013shell hypernuclei,\nwhere the experimental data require \u039b\u2013nucleus potentials with a repulsive core at\nshort distances, the \u039b binding energies have been well reproduced by W\u2013S potentials.\nThe authors of Ref. [166] use a W\u2013S potential with fixed diffuseness (a = 0.6 fm) and\nadjust the radius and depth to reproduce the s and p \u039b\u2013levels.

The Dover's parameters [36], namely R = 2.71 fm and V0 = \u221228 MeV,\ngive rise to a \u039b wave function that is somewhat more extended than the new W\u2013\nS one but is very similar to the one obtained from a harmonic oscillator with an\nempirical frequency ~\u03c9 = 10.9 MeV. Consequently, the non\u2013mesonic width from\nthe Dover's wave function is very similar to the one obtained from the harmonic\noscillator and slightly smaller than the new W\u2013S one. The microscopic wave\u2013function\npredicts the smallest non\u2013mesonic widths due to the more extended \u039b wave\u2013function,\nwhich explores regions of lower density, where the probability of interacting with\none or more nucleons is smaller. From table 10 we also see that, against intuition,\nthe mesonic width is quite insensitive to the \u039b wave function. On this point we\nremind the reader that the more extended is the wave function in r\u2013space, the larger\nis the mesonic width, since the Pauli blocking effects on the emitted nucleon are\nreduced. However, the integral over the \u039b\u2013momenta in Eq. (19) is weighted by the\nmomentum distribution |\u03c8\u0303\u039b (~k)|, which correspondingly tends to cancel the above\nmentioned effect: as a result, \u0393M is insensitive to the different wave functions used in\nthe calculation and it is consistent with both the BNL and KEK data. In summary,\ndifferent (but realistic) \u039b wave functions give rise to total decay widths which may\ndiffer at most by 15%.\n5.6.2\n\nDecay widths of light to heavy \u039b\u2013hypernuclei\n\nUsing the new W\u2013S wave functions and the Landau parameters g \u2032 = 0.8 and g\u039b\u2032 = 0.4,\nin Refs. [166, 191] the calculation has been extended to hypernuclei from 5\u039b He to 208\n\u039b Pb.\nWe note that, in order to reproduce the experimental s and p levels for the hyperon in\nthe different nuclei one must use potentials with nearly constant depth, around 28\u00f732\nMeV, in all but the lightest hypernucleus (5\u039b He). Radii and depths of the employed\nW\u2013S potentials are quoted in table 11. In the case of helium, the \u039b\u2013nucleus mean\npotential has a repulsive core.

This is well known and it is related to the decreasing phase space allowed for the\nmesonic channel, and to smaller overlaps between the \u039b wave function and the nuclear\nsurface, as A increases. In Fig. 13 the results of Refs. [166, 191] for \u0393M (thick solid line)\nare compared with the ones of Nieves\u2013Oset [108] (dashed line) and Motoba\u2013Itonaga\u2013\nBando [109, 110] (solid line), which were obtained within a shell model framework.\nAlso the central values of the available experimental data [90, 98, 209] are shown. Although the wave function method (WFM) is more reliable than the LDA for the evaluation of the mesonic rates (because of the small energies involved in the decay, which\namplify the effects of the nuclear shell structure), we see that this LDA calculation\nagrees with the WFM ones (apart from the case of 208\n\u039b Pb) and with the data. In partic12\n28\nular, the results for \u039b C and \u039b Si are in agreement with the recent KEK measurement\nfree\nfree\n= 0.047 \u00b1 0.008.

Moreover, the\nfree\nrecent KEK experiments [174] obtained the limit: \u0393\u03c0\u2212 (56\n\u039b Fe)/\u0393\u039b < 0.015. It is worth\nnoticing, in figure 13, the rather pronounced oscillations of \u0393M in the calculation of\nRefs. [109, 110], which are caused by shell effects.\nComing back to table 12, we note that, with the exception of 5\u039b He, the two\u2013body\ninduced decay is rather independent of the hypernuclear dimension and it is about\n15% of the total width. Previous works [164, 165] gave more emphasis to this new\nchannel, without, however, reproducing the experimental non\u2013mesonic rates. The\ntotal width does not change much with A, as it is also shown by the experiment.\nIn Fig. 14 the results of table 12 are compared with recent (after 1990) experimental data for \u0393NM and \u0393T [41, 42, 90, 98, 99], while in figure 15 the same comparison\nconcerns the total \u039b lifetime \u03c4 = ~/\u0393T . The theoretical results are in good agreement\nwith the data over the whole hypernuclear mass range explored. The saturation of\nthe \u039bN \u2192 NN interaction in nuclei is well reproduced.\n\n5.7\n\nResults of the microscopic calculation\n\nThe results presented in this subsection have been obtained by applying the formalism\ndeveloped in subsections 5.4 and 5.5 for nuclear matter.

Hence, in order to compare the results with the\nexperimental data in finite nuclei, different Fermi momenta, fixed on the following\nbasis, have been employed in the calculation for nuclear matter. First we remind\nthe reader that in LDA the local Fermi momentum kFA (r) is related to the nuclear\ndensity (45) by equation (17). For the present purpose, the average, fixed Fermi\nmomentum can be obtained by weighting each local kF with the probability density\nof the hyperon in the considered nucleus:\nZ\nhkF iA = d~r kFA (~r)|\u03c8\u039b (~r)|2 .\n(46)\nIn Ref. [166] \u03c8\u039b (~r) has been calculated from a \u039b\u2013nucleus Wood\u2013Saxon potential with\nthickness a = 0.6 fm and with radius and depth which reproduce the measured s and\np \u039b\u2013levels.\nIt is possible to classify the hypernuclei, for which experimental data on the non\u2013\nmesonic decay rate are available, into three mass regions (medium\u2013light: A \u2243 10;\n> 200), as shown in table 13. The\nmedium: A \u2243 30 \u00f7 60; and heavy hypernuclei: A \u223c\nexperimental bands include values of the non\u2013mesonic widths which are compatible\nwith the quoted experiments. For medium and heavy hypernuclei the available experimental data actually refer to the total decay rate. However, from experiments\nand various estimates it turns out that the mesonic width for medium hypernuclei\nis at most 5% of the total width and rapidly decreases as A increases. Therefore,\nexp\nbecause of the low precision of the data, one can safely approximate \u0393exp\nN M with \u0393T\nfor medium and heavy systems. In the third column of table 13 we report the average Fermi momenta obtained with Eq. (46). In the calculations we discuss in the\nfollowing we have then used the following average Fermi momenta: kF = 1.1 fm\u22121 for\nmedium\u2013light, kF = 1.2 fm\u22121 for medium and kF = 1.36 fm\u22121 for heavy hypernuclei.\nIn addition to hkF i, other parameters enter into the microscopic calculation of\nhypernuclear decay widths, which are specifically related to the baryon\u2013meson vertices\nand to the short range correlations. In Ref. [167], with the exception of the Landau\nparameters g \u2032 and g\u039b\u2032 , the values of these parameters have not been left free: rather,\nthey have been kept fixed on the basis of the existing phenomenology (for example in\nthe analysis of quasi\u2013elastic electron\u2013nucleus scattering, spin\u2013isospin nuclear response\nfunctions, etc). For the complete list of these quantities we refer to Ref. [167].\nAn important ingredient in the calculation of the \u039b decay rates is the short range\n77\n\n\fpart of the NN and \u039bN strong interactions: in fact, the momenta involved in the\nnon\u2013mesonic processes are very large. These short range correlations can be parameterized with the functions reported in appendix A. The zero energy and momentum\nlimits of these correlations, g \u2032 and g\u039b\u2032 , are considered as free parameters. We remind\nonce again the reader that no experimental constraint is available on g\u039b\u2032 , while in\nthe framework of ring approximation (namely by neglecting the 2p\u20132h states in the\n\u039b self\u2013energy), realistic values of g \u2032 lie in the range 0.6 \u00f7 0.7 [179]. However, in\nthe present context, g \u2032 enters into the one\u2013boson\u2013loop contributions; moreover, in\nsome diagrams [for instance (f) and (g) of Fig. 8] two consecutive g \u2032 are \"connected\"\nto the same fermionic line, introducing a sort of double counting, which imposes a\nrenormalization of g \u2032 . In the picture of figures 8 and 10 the \u039b self\u2013energy acquires\nan energy and momentum behaviour which cannot be explained and simulated on\nthe basis of the simple ring approximation. Therefore, the physical meaning of the\nLandau parameters is different in the present scheme with respect to the customary\nphenomenology. Hence in Ref. [167] g \u2032 has been used as free parameter, to be fixed\nin order to reproduce the experimental hypernuclear decay rates.\nIn figure 16 we report the real and imaginary parts of the spin\u2013longitudinal (L)\nand spin\u2013transverse (T) polarization propagators in one\u2013boson\u2013loop approximation\nOBL\nUL,T (q0 , ~q) (UL,T = U1 + UL,T\n), which are needed in Eq. (44), as a function of q0 ,\n~q being related to q0 by the constraint of Eq. (12), q0 = k0 \u2212 EN (~k \u2212 q~) \u2212 VN . The\nLandau parameter g \u2032 has been fixed to 0.7 and the Fermi momentum to kF = 1.36\nfm\u22121 . In (a) and (b) we show real and imaginary parts of U1 = U ph + U \u2206h (dashed\nlines) and U1 + ULOBL (solid lines), respectively. The former is the sum of the p\u2013h\nand \u2206\u2013h Lindhard functions of Fig. 10(a), the latter has been calculated by adding\nthe OBL diagrams 10(b)\u201310(f). For reasons related to the technique employed in the\nnumerical evaluation of the Feynman diagrams, it is not possible to separate, in the\nOBL contributions, the imaginary parts which arise from placing on shell p\u2013h and 2p\u2013\n2h excitations. In (c) and (d), the above quantities are plotted for the spin\u2013transverse\nchannel.\nAs discussed in the previous subsection, for fixed g \u2032 the non\u2013mesonic width (the\ntotal width in nuclear matter, where \u0393M = 0) has a minimum as a function of g\u039b\u2032 ,\nwhich is almost independent of the value of g \u2032 (see figure 12). This characteristic\ndoes not depend on the set of diagrams taken into account in the calculation, but it\nis simply due to the interplay between the longitudinal and transverse parts of the\nP \u2013wave \u039bN \u2192 NN potential [P\u0303L and P\u0303T functions of Eqs. (13), (44)]. Thus, also in\nthe microscopic calculation the minimum of \u0393NM is obtained for g\u039b\u2032 \u2243 0.4.\nFixing g\u039b\u2032 = 0.4, in ring approximation one can reproduce the experimental decay\nrates by using g \u2032 values which are compatible with the existing literature. In figure 17\nwe show, as a function of g \u2032 (for g\u039b\u2032 = 0.4), the calculated non\u2013mesonic decay widths\n(in units of the free \u039b width) for the three mass regions of table 13. The thick solid\ncurves refer to the one\u2013boson\u2013loop approximation of Eq. (44) and Fig. 10, while the\ndot\u2013dashed curves are obtained through a RPA iteration of both the particle\u2013hole\nand the one\u2013boson\u2013loop diagrams, namely by using Eq. (13). However, we remind\nthe reader that only the former approximation has a theoretically founded basis, in\nline with the semiclassical scheme introduced in subsection 5.5; moreover, this \"inconsistent\" RPA calculation has the tendency to overestimate, in the acceptable range of\n\n78\n\n\fFigure 16: Polarization propagators in one\u2013boson\u2013loop approximation UL,T (q0 , ~q)\nOBL\n(UL,T = U1 + UL,T\n) of Fig. 10 and Eq.

The dashed lines represent the pure\nring approximation. The calculated widths are compatible with the experimental\nbands for the g \u2032 values reported in table 14. As we have already noticed, the intervals\ncorresponding to the ring calculation are in agreement with the phenomenology of\nother processes, like the (e, e\u2032 ) quasi\u2013elastic scattering. However, only the full calculation (column OBL) allows for a good description (keeping the same g \u2032 value) of the\nrates in the whole range of kF considered here. In Fig. 18 we see the dependence of\nthe non\u2013mesonic widths on the Fermi momentum. The solid lines correspond to the\none\u2013loop approximation, with g \u2032 = 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 from the top to the bottom, while the\ndashed lines refer to the ring approximation, with g \u2032 = 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, again from the\ntop to the bottom. We can then conclude that for the one\u2013loop calculation the best\nchoice for the Landau parameters is the following:\ng \u2032 = 0.8,\n\ng\u039b\u2032 = 0.4.\n\nThis parameterization turns out to be the same that was employed in subsection 5.6.\nHowever, we must point out that in the other calculation the 2p\u20132h contributions\nin the \u039b self\u2013energy have been evaluated by using a phenomenological parameterization of the pion\u2013nucleus optical potential. Here we are considering a microscopical\nevaluation of all the relevant diagrams which contribute at the one\u2013boson\u2013loop level:\nit is evident that the role played by the Landau parameters is different in the two\napproaches.\nIn order to compare the results of the phenomenological and the microscopical\napproaches, it is appropriate to consider the former as obtained with constant density\nrather than in LDA. In table 15 we show the comparison between the one\u2013boson\u2013\nloop approximation (column OBL) and the phenomenological model (column PM) of\nparagraph 5.4.3 at fixed kF . Both calculations have been carried out with g \u2032 = 0.8\nand g\u039b\u2032 = 0.4, and reproduce with the same accuracy the data. For technical reasons,\nthe OBL calculation does not allow to precisely identify the partial rates \u03931 and \u03932\nwhich contribute to the total \u0393NM = \u03931 + \u03932 . In fact, one cannot separate in the\nimaginary parts of the diagrams (b)\u2013(f) of Fig. 10 the contributions coming from cuts\non p\u2013h and 2p\u20132h states, and hence the partial width (\u03932 ) stemming from the two\u2013\nhave been obtained\nnucleon induced decay.

In this approximation, \u0393OBL\n= \u0393ring [second,\n1\nthird and fourth terms in the right hand side of Eq. (44)]. As a matter of fact, one\nwould expect that \u03932 increases with kF (and this is the case for the PM calculation),\nbut the OBL results do not follow this statement.

Actually,\nthe large experimental uncertainties involved in the extraction of the ratio do not allow to reach any definitive conclusion. The data are quite limited and not precise due\nto the difficulty of detecting the products of the non\u2013mesonic decays, especially the\nneutrons. Moreover, up to now it has not been possible to distinguish between nucleons produced by the one\u2013body induced and the (non\u2013negligible) two\u2013body induced\ndecay mechanism.\nThe Polarization Propagator Method used to obtain the results discussed in subsections 5.6 and 5.7 does not distinguish between neutron\u2013 and proton\u2013induced processes, but makes an \"average\" over these reactions. However, within a \u039bN \u2192 NN\nOPE model, a simple counting of the isospin factors in the diagrams contributing to\nthe non\u2013mesonic width at lowest order (low density limit) and for a \u039b at rest, gives\n< 10 (N and Z are the number of neutrons and pro[54] \u0393n /\u0393p \u2243 N/(14 Z) for N, Z \u223c\ntons of the hypernucleus, respectively) when only the (dominating) parity\u2013conserving\npart of the \u039b\u03c0N vertex is taken into account. For heavier systems, a nearly constant\nratio (\u2243 1/14) is expected, as a result of the saturation of the \u039bn \u2192 nn and \u039bp \u2192 np\ninteractions. The inclusion of the \u039b\u03c0N parity\u2013violating term tends to increase the\nOPE ratio [125]. As we have seen in section 4, more refined calculations in OPE agree\nwith the previous naive expectation, with values in the interval:\n\u0014\n\n\u0393n\n\u0393p\n\n\u0015OPE\n\n\u2243 0.05 \u00f7 0.20,\n\n(47)\n\nfor all the considered systems. The small OPE ratios\nare due to the \u2206I = 1/2\n\u221a\nrule, which fixes the vertex ratio V\u039b\u03c0\u2212 p /V\u039b\u03c00 n = \u2212 2 (both in S\u2013 and P \u2013wave interactions), and to the particular form of the OPE potential, which has a strong\ntensor and weak central and parity\u2013violating components: the large tensor transition\n\u039bN(3 S1 ) \u2192 NN(3 D1 ) requires, in fact, I = 0 np pairs in the anti\u2013symmetric final\nstate. In p\u2013shell and heavier hypernuclei the relative \u039bN L = 1 state is found to give\nonly a small contribution to tensor transitions for the neutron\u2013induced decay, so it\ncannot improve the ratio (47). The contribution of the \u039bN L = 1 relative state to\n\u0393n + \u0393p seems to be of about 5 \u00f7 15% in p\u2013shell hypernuclei [116\u2013118]. For these\nsystems we expect the dominance of the S\u2013wave interaction in the initial state, due\nto the small \u039bN relative momentum.\nBy using again a simple argument about the isospin structure of the \u039bN \u2192 NN\ninteraction in OPE, it is possible\nto estimate that for pure \u2206I = 3/2 transitions\n\u221a\n(for which V\u039b\u03c0\u2212 p /V\u039b\u03c00 n = 1/ 2) the OPE ratio is increased by a factor \u2243 2.5 with\nrespect to the value obtained for pure \u2206I = 1/2 transitions. On the other hand,\nthe OPE model with \u2206I = 1/2 couplings has been able to reproduce the one\u2013body\nstimulated non\u2013mesonic rates \u03931 = \u0393n + \u0393p for s\u2013 and p\u2013shell hypernuclei [117\u2013121].\nHence, the problem rather consists in overestimating the proton\u2013induced rate and\nunderestimating the neutron\u2013induced one.\n84\n\n\fOther ingredients beyond the OPE might be responsible for the large experimental\nratios. A few calculations with \u039bN \u2192 NN transition potentials including heavy\u2013\nmeson\u2013exchange or direct quark contributions have improved the situation, without\nproviding, nevertheless, a satisfactory theoretical explanation of the puzzle: very\nrecent evaluations showed the importance of both K\u2013meson\u2013exchange [118, 125, 131]\nand direct quark mechanism [131] to obtain larger ratios. The tensor component\nof K\u2013exchange has opposite sign with respect to the one for \u03c0\u2013exchange, resulting\nin a reduction of \u0393p . The parity violating \u039bN(3 S1 ) \u2192 NN(3 P1 ) transition, which\ncontributes to both the n\u2013 and p\u2013induced processes, is considerably enhanced by\nK\u2013exchange and direct quark mechanism and tends to increase \u0393n /\u0393p [118, 131].\nIn table 17 we summarize the calculations that predicted ratios considerably enhanced with respect to the OPE values. Experimental data are given for comparison.\nAlmost all calculations reproduce the observed non\u2013mesonic widths \u0393n + \u0393p , as\nTable 17: \u0393n /\u0393p ratio.\nRef. and Model\nItonaga et al. 1998 [117]\n(\u03c0 + 2\u03c0/\u03c1 + 2\u03c0/\u03c3)\nSasaki et al. 2000 [131]\n(\u03c0 + K+ DQ)\nJun et al. 2001 [132]\n(OPE + 4BPI)\nJido et al. 2001 [125]\n(\u03c0 + K + 2\u03c0 + \u03c9)\nParre\u00f1o\u2013Ramos 2001 [118]\n(\u03c0 + \u03c1 + K + K \u2217 + \u03c9 + \u03b7)\nExp 1974 [135]\nExp BNL 1991 [90]\nExp KEK 1995 [98]\nExp KEK 1995 [173]\nExp KEK 2001 [177, 178]\n\n5\n\u039b He\n\n12\n\u039bC\n\nNuclear Matter\n\n0.36\n0.701\n1.30\n\n0.716\n1.14\n0.53\n\n0.343 \u00f7 0.457 0.288 \u00f7 0.341\n0.93 \u00b1 0.55\n1.97 \u00b1 0.67\n\n0.59 \u00b1 0.15\n1.33+1.12\n\u22120.81\n1.87+0.67\n\u22121.16\n1.17+0.22\n\u22120.20\n\n56\n\u039b Fe:\n\n2.54+0.61\n\u22120.81\n\none can see in table 18: only Parre\u00f1o and Ramos tends to underestimate the data\nfor 12\n\u039b C, whereas Sasaki et al. overestimate the most accurate experiments for very\nheavy hypernuclei.

By assuming that the meson produced in the weak vertex is\nmainly absorbed by an isoscalar NN correlated pair (quasi\u2013deuteron approximation),\nthe three\u2013body process turns out to be \u039bnp \u2192 nnp, so that a considerable fraction of\nthe measured neutrons could come from this channel and not only from \u039bn \u2192 nn and\n\u039bp \u2192 np. In this way it might be possible to explain the large experimental \u0393n /\u0393p ratios, which originally have been analyzed without taking into account the two\u2013body\nstimulated process. Nevertheless, the situation is far from being clear and simple,\nboth from the theoretical and experimental viewpoints. The new non\u2013mesonic mode\nwas introduced in Ref. [164] and its calculation was improved in Ref. [165], where the\nauthors found that the inclusion of the new channel would bring to extract from the\nexperiment even larger values for the \u0393n /\u0393p ratios, thus worsening the disagreement\nwith the theoretical estimates. However, in the hypothesis that only two out of the\nthree nucleons coming from the three\u2013body decay are detected, the reanalysis of the\nexperimental data would lead back to smaller ratios [114]. The above hypothesis is\nplausible for the following reason. The two\u2013body induced decay mode takes place\nwhen the pion emitted by the \u039b vertex is not too far from being on its renormalized\n86\n\n\fmass\u2013shell (on the contrary, the particle\u2013hole region of the in\u2013medium pion excitation\nspectrum, which contributes to the one\u2013body induced decay, would be quite far from\nthe pionic branch in the medium). It occurs that the pionic branch (which is a delta\nfunction on the energy\u2013momentum dispersion relation in free space) is renormalized\nin the medium and has a width associated to its capability in exciting 2p\u20132h states.\nPart of this strength overcomes the Pauli blocking, giving rise to the two\u2013body induced decay. As a consequence of the emission of an \"almost on\u2013shell\" pion, the\nnucleon coming out from the \u039b vertex will have a small kinetic energy (TN \u2243 5 MeV\nfor a rigorously on\u2013shell pion) and hence will be, most probably, below the experimental detection threshold, which was around 30\u00f740 MeV in the experiments quoted\nin table 17.\nThese observations show that \u0393n /\u0393p is sensitive to the detection threshold and to\nthe detailed kinematics of the process. For instance, the calculated energy spectra\nof the emitted nucleons clearly display the above statement about the slow nucleon\nemitted in the weak vertex [192]; their calculation also requires a careful treatment\nof the nucleon final state interactions. In Ref. [192] the nucleon energy distributions have been calculated by using a Monte Carlo simulation to describe nucleon's\nrescattering inside the nucleus: the ratio \u0393n /\u0393p has been taken as a free parameter\nand extracted by comparing the simulated spectra with the experimental data. The\nmomentum distributions of the primary nucleons were determined within the polarization propagator scheme discussed in subsection 5.4. In their way out of the nucleus,\nthe nucleons, due to the collisions with other nucleons, continuously change energy,\ndirection, charge, and secondary nucleons are emitted as well. Then, the energy distribution of the observable nucleons, which also loose their energy by the interactions\nwith the experimental set\u2013up, is different from the one at the level of the primary\nnucleons. The shape of the proton spectrum obtained in Ref. [192] is sensitive to\nthe ratio \u0393n /\u0393p . The protons from the three\u2013nucleon mechanism \u039bNN \u2192 NNN\nappear mainly at low energies, while, for 12\n\u039b C, those from the one\u2013nucleon stimulated\nprocess peak around 75 MeV. Since the experimental spectra show a fair amount\nof protons in the low energy region, they would favour a relatively larger two\u2013body\ninduced decay rate and/or a reduced number of protons from the one\u2013body induced\nprocess. Consequently, for \u03932 = 0.27 \u0393free\nthe authors of Ref. [192] found that the\n\u039b\nexperimental spectra of Refs. [90, 135] were compatible with values of \u0393n /\u0393p around\n3 for 12\n\u039b C, in strong contradiction with the theoretical predictions. However, by using\navailable data on the total number of emitted neutrons and protons, the same calculation shows that the experimental error bars on \u0393n /\u0393p are increased by the inclusion\nof the three\u2013body channel, leading to values which, within one standard deviation,\ncan be even compatible with the OPE values. In Ref. [192] it was also pointed out\nthe convenience of measuring the number of outgoing protons per decay event. This\nobservable, which can be measured from delayed fission events in the decay of heavy\nhypernuclei, gives a more reliable neutron to proton ratio and it is less sensitive to\nthe details of the intra\u2013nuclear cascade calculation determining the final shape of the\nspectra.\nThe excellent agreement of the calculations discussed in subsection 5.6 for the\nexperimental total non\u2013mesonic decay rates made it worth to explore again the predictions for the nucleon spectra [166]. The question is whether the model used in 5.6\naffects the momentum distribution of the primary emitted nucleons strongly enough\n87\n\n\fCounts (arb. units)\n\n30\n\u0393n/\u0393p=0.1\n\u0393n/\u0393p=1.0\n\u0393n/\u0393p=2.0\n\u0393n/\u0393p=3.0\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nTp (MeV)\nFigure 19: Proton spectrum from the decay of 12\n\u039b C for different values of \u0393n /\u0393p . The\nexperimental data are from Ref. [90] (taken from Ref. [166]).\n\nto obtain good agreement with the experimental proton spectra without requiring\nvery large values for \u0393n /\u0393p . The nucleon spectra from the decay of several hypernuclei have been thus generated by using the Monte Carlo simulation of Ref. [192]. The\nspectra obtained for various values of \u0393n /\u0393p , used again as a free parameter, are compared in Fig. 19 (Fig. 20) with the data from the BNL experiment of Ref. [90] (from\nRef. [135]). We remark that, although the total non\u2013mesonic widths are smaller\nthan those of Ref. [192] by about 35%, the resulting nucleon spectra, once they are\nnormalized to the same non\u2013mesonic rate, are practically identical. The reason is\nthat the ratio \u03932 /\u03931 of two\u2013body induced versus one\u2013body induced decay rates is\nessentially the same in both models (between 0.2 and 0.15 from medium to heavy\nhypernuclei), and the momentum distributions for the primary emitted protons are\nalso very similar. As a consequence, the conclusions drawn in Ref. [192] still hold\nand the new calculation also favours very large values of \u0393n /\u0393p when compared with\nexperimental spectra.\nOn the basis of the above considerations, the origin of the discrepancy between\ntheory and experiment for \u0393n /\u0393p is far from being resolved. On the theoretical side,\nthere is still room for improving the numerical simulation of the nuclear final state\ninteractions: Coulomb distortion, multiple scattering and the evaporating process\nshould be incorporated in the calculation. In particular, multiple scattering and the\nevaporating process are important ingredients, which increase the nucleon spectra at\n88\n\n\f100\n\u0393n/\u0393p=0.1\n\u0393n/\u0393p=1.0\n\u0393n/\u0393p=2.0\n\u0393n/\u0393p=3.0\n\nCounts (arb. units)\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nTp (MeV)\nFigure 20: Proton spectrum from the decay of\nexperimental data are taken from Ref.

On the experimental side, although more recent spectra are available\n[98, 193], they have not been corrected for the energy losses inside the target and\ndetector as well as for the geometry of the detector, so a direct comparison with\ntheoretical predictions is not possible.\nAttempts to incorporate these corrections by combining a theoretical model for\nthe nucleon rescattering in the nucleus with a simulation of the interactions in the\nexperimental set\u2013up have been done at KEK [177, 178, 194]. The results reported in\nRefs. [177, 178] show that \u0393n /\u0393p increases with the hypernucleus mass number, with\n28\n56\nvalues in the range 1 \u00f7 3 for 12\n\u039b C, \u039b Si and \u039b Fe. In the next paragraph we shall discuss\nin detail these recent results.\nA decisive forward step towards a clean extraction of \u0393n /\u0393p would be obtained\nif the nucleons from the different non\u2013mesonic processes, \u039bN \u2192 NN and \u039bNN \u2192\nNNN, were disentangled. Through the measurement of coincidence spectra and angular correlations of the outgoing nucleons, it could be possible, in the near future, to\nsplit the non\u2013mesonic decay width into its two components \u03931 and \u03932 [93, 136, 195]\nand obtain a more precise and direct measurement of \u0393n /\u0393p . We shall discuss this\nimportant point more extensively in paragraph 6.2.3. By using a simple argument\nabout the detection efficiency in coincidence measurements, the authors of Ref. [136]\nevaluated the influence of the final state interactions and of the two\u2013body induced\nprocess on \u0393NM to be of (15 \u00b1 15)% for s\u2013shell hypernuclei. According to the calculation reported in table 12, for 5\u039b He the effect of the two\u2013body stimulated decay alone\nis \u03932 /\u0393NM = 13%.\n6.2.1\n\nRecent experimental spectra\n\n28\n56\nVery recently, at KEK\u2013E307 [177, 178], the proton spectra for 12\n\u039b C, \u039b Si and \u039b Fe have\nbeen measured and compared with theoretical simulations of the intra\u2013nuclear cascades after the weak processes, obtained with the MC code of Ref. [192]. Corrections\nfor the detector geometry and the nucleonic interactions inside the target and detector materials have also been implemented, through a GEANT MC code. The proton\nenergy spectra have been measured by means of a coincidence counter system identifying the hypernuclear production instant time through the detection of the kaon\nemitted in the n(\u03c0 + , K + )\u039b production reaction. In figure 21 the spectra obtained for\n12\n28\n\u039b C and \u039b Si are shown. The vertical axes are normalized to the number of protons\nper hypernuclear decay.\nThe results of KEK\u2013E307 supply a \u0393n /\u0393p ratio, again estimated by fitting the\nproton spectra, which increases with the mass number [177, 178]:\n\n\u0393n 12\n( C) = 1.17+0.22\n\u22120.20 ,\n\u0393p \u039b\n\u0393n 28\n( Si) = 1.38+0.30\n\u22120.27 ,\n\u0393p \u039b\n\u0393n 56\n( Fe) = 2.54+0.61\n\u22120.81 ,\n\u0393p \u039b\n\n(48)\n\nthe last one being preliminary. Because of the non\u2013zero experimental energy threshold\nfor proton detection, the obtained fits for \u0393n /\u0393p turn out to be slightly sensitive\n90\n\n\fFigure 21: Proton energy spectra measured at KEK\u2013E307 (taken from Ref. [177])\n\n91\n\n\fto the two\u2013body induced process, although this mechanism gives a non\u2013negligible\n28\ncontribution to the non\u2013mesonic rate: for 12\n\u039b C and \u039b Si, the central values of \u0393n /\u0393p are\nreduced by about 16% when the two\u2013body induced process is taken into account, with\nresults anyhow compatible within the error bars in both descriptions [177]. The fits\nincluding the two\u2013nucleon stimulated decay have been performed by using \u03932 /(\u03931 +\n\u03932 ) \u2243 0.3 as input. This small effect of the two\u2013nucleon stimulated decay is principally\ndue to the rather large value of the proton energy detection threshold (ETh \u2243 40 MeV)\nwith respect to the average energy of the protons from the process \u039bNN \u2192 NNN.\nThe results reported in Eq. (48) and figure 21 refer to the analysis in which only\nthe one\u2013nucleon induced process is taken into account. The fits which included the\n+0.24\n28\ntwo\u2013nucleon induced processes lead to: \u0393n /\u0393p (12\n\u039b C) = 0.96\u22120.23 and \u0393n /\u0393p (\u039b Si) =\n+0.33\n1.18\u22120.31 . At the present level of precision, the observation of signals from the two\u2013\nbody induced decay is thus impossible. However, the degree of accuracy of the new\nKEK measurements allowed to significantly improve the error bars with respect to\nthe previous experiments (see data listed in table 17): this leads to exclude neutron\nto proton ratios smaller than 0.73 (0.50) at the 1\u03c3 (2\u03c3) level for 12\n\u039b C, in the analysis\nincluding the two\u2013nucleon induced process.\nWe want to make the following remark on the mass dependence of the KEK\u2013E307\n56\nresults. The ratio \u0393n /\u0393p sizeably increases in going from 28\n\u039b Si [177] to \u039b Fe [178] (we\nremind the reader that the data for iron are only preliminary). This is in disagreement\nwith the well known behaviour of the \u039bN \u2192 NN interaction in nuclei, namely its\nsaturation for large mass numbers. In fact, should we estimate, as in paragraph 5.6.2,\n56\nthe mesonic rate for 28\n\u039b Si and \u039b Fe to be 0.07 and 0.01, respectively (here and in the\nfollowing the decay rates are in units of \u0393free\n\u039b ) and use the total decay rates measured\nin the same experiments [99], then for the central values of the non\u2013mesonic decay\n56\nwidth we would obtain: \u0393NM (28\n\u039b Si) = \u0393NM (\u039b Fe) = 1.21. This value, together with\n28\n56\nthe ratios of Eq. (48), provides: \u0393n (\u039b Si) = 0.70, \u0393p (28\n\u039b Si) = 0.51, \u0393n (\u039b Fe) = 0.87 and\n\u0393p (56\n\u039b Fe) = 0.34. As a consequence, \u0393n and \u0393p do not follow the saturation behaviour\n(the contrary occurs for the observed total rate \u0393NM = \u0393n + \u0393p ), which predicts n\u2013\nand p\u2013stimulated rates increasing with N and Z, respectively, and saturating for\nsat\n>\nN, Z \u2243 10: \u0393n /\u0393p \u2243 \u0393sat\nn /\u0393p for N, Z \u223c 10. Since one also expects a saturation for\nthe neutron\u2013 and proton\u2013induced decay rates separately, this result could represent\na signal of a systematic error in the experimental analysis employed to extract the\n\u0393n /\u0393p ratios.\n6.2.2\n\nPossible improvements\n\nAs discussed above, the \u0393n /\u0393p ratios of Eq. (48), extracted from the recently measured\nproton spectra, confirm the results of previous experiments: the neutron\u2013 and proton\u2013\ninduced decay rates are of the same order of magnitude over a large hypernuclear mass\nnumber range. However, since the new experiments have significantly improved the\nquality of the data, small values of \u0393n /\u0393p (say smaller than 0.7 for 12\n\u039b C) are now\nexcluded with good precision.\nAfter having inspected both the experimental procedures and the theoretical models until now developed to determine the ratio, we want to summarize here some\ninteresting features which could bring to future perspectives:\n1) The proton spectra originating from neutron\u2013 and proton\u2013induced processes\n92\n\n\f(and, eventually, from two\u2013nucleon stimulated decays) are added incoherently\nin the Monte Carlo intra\u2013nuclear cascade calculations used to determine \u0393n /\u0393p .\nIn this way a possible quantum\u2013mechanical interference effect between the two\nchannels is lost. Therefore, in an experiment like KEK\u2013E307, in which only\ncharged particles are detected, one cannot go back up to the decay mechanism\nwhich produced an observed proton. The conclusion of paragraph 6.2.1 about\na possible systematic error in the experimental analyses of \u0393n /\u0393p could then\nbe due to the incorrect procedure of summing incoherently, i.e. in a classical\npicture, the proton spectra from the \u039bn \u2192 nn and \u039bp \u2192 np processes.\n2) The experimental spectra of figure 21 do not exhibit a peak around the energy\n(\u2243 75 MeV) which corresponds to the kinematical situation of back\u2013to\u2013back\nnucleon pairs coming from one\u2013nucleon induced decays. The shape of the spectra just above the 30 MeV detection threshold are quite flat, or even decreasing\nfor increasing energy, and are not well fitted by the simulations used to extract\n\u0393n /\u0393p . This is in principle due to different, hardly distinguishable, effects: 1)\nthe nucleon energy losses in the nucleus, 2) the nucleon energy losses in the target and detector materials, and 3) the relevance of the two\u2013nucleon stimulated\nnon\u2013mesonic decay. Because of the present level of experimental accuracy, an\nanalysis which takes into account the two\u2013nucleon induced decay alone cannot\nimprove the comparison between experiment and theory. It would then be advisable to explore the effects of robust nucleon final state interactions on the\nsimulations used to determine the ratio from the experimental spectra.\n3) The direct observation of the three\u2013body emission events is quite difficult and\nup to now no signal has been found. The calculated nucleon spectra [192] for\nthis channel present a maximum at energies below the detection threshold, and\nonly a fraction (about 40% for \u0393n /\u0393p = 1 and ETh = 40 MeV) of nucleons\nfrom three\u2013body emission can be detected. Moreover, for E > ETh the nucleon\ndistribution from one\u2013body induced processes superimposes to the previous one.\nThe spectrum simulated for the two\u2013nucleon emission dominates and, for 12\n\u039b C,\npeaks at an energy (\u2243 75 MeV) that corresponds to the situation in which\nthe two nucleons come out back\u2013to\u2013back. This observation shows that the\nseparation of the nucleons from the two non\u2013mesonic channels is only possible\nby angular correlation measurements. In Ref. [136] the authors studied how\nthe back\u2013to\u2013back kinematics is able to select the one\u2013nucleon induced process,\nand NN coincidence measurements (of energies and angular distributions) are\nexpected in the near future at Da\u03a6ne [93], KEK [195] and BNL [196].\n4) In order to disentangle the two\u2013nucleon induced decay events from the one\u2013\nnucleon induced ones, the direct observation of the outgoing neutrons is thus\nneeded. Neutron spectra can be measured down to about 10 MeV kinetic energy,\nsince they are less affected than the proton ones by energy losses in the target\nand detector materials. The joint observation of proton and neutron spectra\ncould then help to disentangle the set\u2013up material effects from the nucleon final\nstate interactions occurring inside the residual nucleus. A very recent exper89\niment, KEK\u2013E369, measured neutron spectra from 12\n\u039b C and \u039b Y non\u2013mesonic\ndecays [197]. A preliminary analysis of data is consistent with a ratio in the\n93\n\n\frange 0.5 \u00f7 1 for 12\n\u039b C, obtained through a new intra\u2013nuclear calculation. The\nnewly developed Monte Carlo code with the same range of \u0393n /\u0393p values also\nseems to be able to reproduce the 12\n\u039b C proton spectrum observed at KEK\u2013E307.\nThese analyses have been performed by neglecting the contribution of the two\u2013\nnucleon induced decay.\n5) In our opinion, the key point to avoid the possible deficiencies of the single nucleon spectra measurements discussed in point 1), will be to employ coincidence\ndetections of the final nucleons. Only such a procedure leads to a direct and\nunambiguous determination of \u0393n /\u0393p . In the experiment KEK\u2013E462 [195], an\nangular and energy correlation measurement will study the decay of 5\u039b He hypernuclei. Very low detection thresholds (\u2243 10 MeV for neutrons and \u2243 20 MeV\nfor protons) and statistics improved with respect to previous measurements will\nbe used. By using a light, spin\u2013isospin saturated hypernucleus such as 5\u039b He,\none has the good point that the nuclear final state interaction are considerably\nreduced. The use of low nucleon threshold energies will make it possible to\nobserve essentially all the final state interactions effects. Another experiment,\nat BNL [196], will measure \u0393n /\u0393p for 4\u039b H, again by nn and np coincidence\nmeasurements.\n6.2.3\n\nPotentialities of coincidence experiments\n\nWe concentrate here on the potentialities of future experiments employing double\ncoincidence nucleon detection. The purpose is to stress the importance of this kind\nof measurements both for the solution of the \u0393n /\u0393p puzzle and for the observation of\ntwo\u2013nucleon stimulated decay events.\nA simplistic analysis supplies the following expressions for the numbers of detected\nneutrons, Nn = Nn1B + Nn2B , and protons, Np = Np1B + Np2B , in terms of the non\u2013\nmesonic partial decay widths:\nNn1B = \u01ebn \u03a9n Rn\nNn2B\n\n2\u0393n + \u0393p\nN,\n\u0393T\n\n2\u03932\nN,\n= \u01ebn \u03a9n Rn\n\u0393T\n\nNp1B = \u01ebp \u03a9p Rp\nNp2B\n\n\u0393p\nN,\n\u0393T\n\n(49)\n\n\u03932\n= \u01ebp \u03a9p Rp\nN.\n\u0393T\n\nHere, \u01ebn (\u01ebp ) is the neutron (proton) detection efficiency, \u03a9n (\u03a9p ) the detector acceptance for neutrons (protons) and Rn (Rp ) the fraction of outgoing neutrons (protons)\nwith kinetic energy above the detection threshold. The quantities Rn and Rp take into\naccount the nucleon rescattering effects in the nucleus, which influence, as previously\ndiscussed, the numbers of observed neutrons and protons. Moreover, in the relations\nfor the number of neutrons and protons originating from two\u2013body induced decays,\nNn2B and Np2B , we have employed the quasi\u2013deuteron approximation, in which the\nthree\u2013body processes proceeds mainly through the channel \u039bnp \u2192 nnp. By imposing \u01ebn \u03a9n Rn = \u01ebp \u03a9p Rp = 1, the previous equations supply the number of nucleons at\nthe weak decay vertex. Finally, \u0393T is the total decay width (\u0393T = \u0393n + \u0393p + \u03932 + \u0393M )\nand N the total number of decayed hypernuclei. In an experimental analysis, the\nratio \u0393n /\u0393p can then be obtained from the measurement of Nn , Np , N and \u0393T and\n94\n\n\fthe theoretical evaluation of \u03932 as follows:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nNn\nNn\n\u03932\n\u03b1\n\u22121+ \u03b1\n\u22122\n\u0393n\nNp\nNp\n\u0393n + \u0393p\n\u0013\n\u0012\n,\n=\n\u03932\nNn\n\u0393p\n\u22122\n2\u2212 \u03b1\nNp\n\u0393n + \u0393p\n\n(50)\n\nwhere:\n1\n\u0393n + \u0393p =\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nNn\nNp\n+\n\u01ebn \u03a9n Rn \u01ebp \u03a9p Rp\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0393T 3\n\u2212 \u03932 ,\nN\n2\n\n(51)\n\nand:\n\u03b1\u2261\n\n\u01ebp \u03a9p Rp\n.\n\u01ebn \u03a9n Rn\n\nOn the other hand, the numbers of nn and np coincidence detections for an opening\nangle \u03b8 between the pairs are:\n\u0393n\nN,\n\u0393T\n1B\n1B \u0393p\nNnp\n(\u03b8) = \u01ebn \u01ebp \u03a9N N (\u03b8) fN1BN (\u03b8) Rnp\nN,\n\u0393T\n1B\n1B\nNnn\n(\u03b8) = \u01eb2n \u03a9N N (\u03b8) fN1BN (\u03b8) Rnn\n\n(52)\n\nrespectively, when two\u2013body stimulated decays are neglected. With \u03a9N N (\u03b8) we have\ndenoted the average acceptance for nucleon pairs detected at an opening angle \u03b8,\n1B\nwhile fN1BN (\u03b8) is the NN angular correlation function for \u039bN \u2192 NN. Finally, Rnn\n1B\nand Rnp are, respectively, the fraction of nn and np pairs from one\u2013body induced\nprocesses leaving the residual nucleus with energies above the detection thresholds.\nThe ratio \u0393n /\u0393p can then be measured through the following relation:\n1B\n\u0393n\nN 1B \u01ebp Rnp\n,\n= nn\n1B \u01eb R1B\n\u0393p\nNnp\nn\nnn\n\n(53)\n\n1B\n1B\nNnn\nand Nnp\nbeing the total numbers of detected nn and np pairs from one\u2013body\ninduced decays, respectively.\nAngular two\u2013nucleon correlation measurements allow to disentangle the two\u2013body\nstimulated decays from the total set of data. The number of nn and np pair detected\nat an angle \u03b8 and originating from three\u2013body decays are:\n\n\u03932\nN,\n\u0393T\n2B\n2B 2\u03932\nNnp\n(\u03b8) = \u01ebn \u01ebp \u03a9N N (\u03b8) fN2BN (\u03b8) Rnp\nN,\n\u0393T\n\n2B\n2B\nNnn\n(\u03b8) = \u01eb2n \u03a9N N (\u03b8) fN2BN (\u03b8) Rnn\n\n(54)\n\nrespectively, the factor 2 in the second equation being the number of np pairs in\nthe three\u2013particle final state nnp. Besides, fN2BN (\u03b8) is the NN angular correlation\n2B\n2B\nfunction for three\u2013body decays, while Rnn\n(Rnp\n) is the fraction of nn (np) pairs from\ntwo\u2013nucleon induced decays leaving the nucleus with energies above the detection\n95\n\n\fthresholds. Nucleon pairs from one\u2013body induced decays are mainly emitted back\u2013\nto\u2013back with \u2243 75 MeV kinetic energy. A detailed study [136] of the NN angular\ncorrelation function in \u039bN \u2192 NN, fN1BN (\u03b8), shows that the NN opening angles are\n\"with great probability\" larger than 140\u25e6 for s\u2013shell hypernuclei. On the contrary,\nthe function fN2BN (\u03b8) peaks around 120\u25e6 . By using the approximation that all pairs\ndetected at angles \u03b8 > 140\u25e6 (\u03b8 < 140\u25e6 ) come from one\u2013nucleon (two\u2013nucleon) induced\nprocesses (this assumption is realistic only for light hypernuclei, where a small effect\nof the final state interactions is expected), one can give an estimate of the various\nN's.\nTo do this, we refer to the case of the experiment KEK\u2013E462 [195], which will\nstudy the decay of 5\u039b He hypernuclei. Let us start by assuming that \u0393n = \u0393p = 0.20\nand \u0393T = 1.00 (the widths are in units of \u0393free\n\u039b ). These values agrees with the results\nof the 1991 BNL experiment [90]. Moreover, from the calculation presented in table\n1B\n12 it follows a ratio \u03932 /(\u0393n + \u0393p ) = 0.15. It is not easy to evaluate Rn , Rp , Rnn\n,\n1B\n2B\n2B\nRnp , Rnn and Rnp : neglecting the nucleon rescattering effects in the residual nucleus\nand assuming a 0 MeV detection threshold, these quantities are equal to 1. The\nnuclear final state interactions increase the total number of nucleons outgoing from\nthe nucleus with respect to the number of nucleons at the weak decay vertex, but a\nnon\u2013zero energy detection thresholds decreases the number of final nucleons which\ncan be observed [192]. The R's factors depend on a delicate balance between these two\neffects. A simulation of single and coincidence nucleon spectra fitting experimental\ndata allows to determine these quantities. Here, we can use as a guidance the results\nof Refs. [90, 136, 192] to estimate that, very roughly, for the detection thresholds which\n1B\n1B\nwill be used at KEK\u2013E462 (around 10\u00f720 MeV), Rn , Rp , Rnn\nand Rnp\nare sufficiently\n2B\n2B\nclose to 1 and Rnn\n\u2243 Rnp\n\u2243 0.8 for 5\u039b He. Further, the following parameters of this\nexperiment are needed [195]:\n\u01ebn = 0.23,\n\u01ebp = 0.85,\n\u03a9n = 0.27,\n\u03a9p = 0.18,\n2B\n\u03a91B\n=\n0.143,\n\u03a9\nNN\nN N = 0.05,\n2B\nwhere \u03a91B\nN N and \u03a9N N are the total detector acceptances for NN pairs coming from\none\u2013body and two\u2013body induced processes, respectively. The latter quantities are\nobtained by averaging the functions \u03a9N N (\u03b8) fN1BN (\u03b8) and \u03a9N N (\u03b8) fN2BN (\u03b8) of Eqs. (52),\n(54) over the intervals \u03b8 > 140\u25e6 and \u03b8 < 140\u25e6, respectively. By observing N = 100000\ndecays of 5\u039b He hypernuclei, we thus expect the following total number of counts:\n\nNn1B\nNn2B\n1B\nNnn\n2B\nNnn\n\n= 3726,\n= 745,\n= 151,\n= 13,\n\nNp1B\nNp2B\n1B\nNnp\n2B\nNnp\n\n= 3060,\n= 918,\n= 559,\n= 94.\n\n(55)\n\nIf, on the contrary, one assumes \u0393n + \u0393p = 0.3 (this value agrees with the calculation\npresented in table 12) and \u0393n /\u0393p = 0.5, the number of counts are:\nNn1B\nNn2B\n1B\nNnn\n2B\nNnn\n\n= 2484,\n= 559,\n= 76,\n= 10,\n\nNp1B\nNp2B\n1B\nNnp\n2B\nNnp\n\n96\n\n= 3060,\n= 689,\n= 559,\n= 70,\n\n(56)\n\n\frespectively. From these estimates one reaches the following important conclusion: if\nthe two\u2013nucleon induced decay rate is about 15% of the total non\u2013mesonic width, from\nexisting data and calculations on \u0393n and \u0393p one expects a non\u2013negligible number of\nNN coincidence counts (of the order of 100) coming from two\u2013body induced processes\nfor an ensemble of N = 100000 hypernuclear decays.\nIn an experiment which would measure the quantities of Eqs. (55), (56) with sufficient statistics, one has two independent ways to determine the ratio \u0393n /\u0393p [by using\nEqs. (50) and (53)] and, once \u0393T is measured, two independent ways to determine \u03932\n[Eqs. (54)]. Careful analyses of the nucleon final state interactions must be done, in\norder to estimate the different factors R's. We must also note that the use of Eq. (50)\nto obtain the ratio could be affected by problems related to interference effects between neutron\u2013 and proton\u2013stimulated decays, as mentioned in point 1) of paragraph\n6.2.2. A determination of the ratio with both Eqs. (50) and (53) will thus be able to\nquantify these interference effects.\nTo study the effect of the two\u2013nucleon stimulated decay on the determination of\n\u0393n /\u0393p for experiments which do not detect the nucleons in double coincidence, let us\nconsider the data from the BNL experiment of Ref. [90] for 5\u039b He:\nNn\n\u01ebn \u03a9n\n\n5\n\u039b He\n\n\u0001\n\nNp\n\u01ebp \u03a9p\n\n= 3000 \u00b1 1300,\n\n5\n\u039b He\n\n\u0001\n\n= 1730 \u00b1 260.\n\nIn order to calculate \u0393n /\u0393p with Eq. (50), an estimate of the nuclear final state\ninteraction effects for the outgoing nucleons is required. By using as a guidance the\nanalyses of Refs. [90, 136, 192, 197], one has that, very roughly, Rp /Rn \u2243 1 \u00f7 1.1\nfor the energy thresholds of the BNL experiment (\u2243 30 \u00f7 40 MeV). By assuming\n\u03932 /(\u0393n + \u0393p ) = 0.15, Eq. (50) then supplies:\n\u0393n\n\u0393p\n\n5\n\u039b He\n\n\u0001\n\n= 0.44+0.53\n\u22120.44\n\n(1B + 2B, Rp /Rn = 1.1),\n\n(57)\n\nwhile neglecting the two\u2013nucleon induced channel:\n\u0393n\n\u0393p\n\n5\n\u039b He\n\n\u0001\n\n= 0.45 \u00b1 0.44\n\n(1B only, Rp /Rn = 1.1).\n\n(58)\n\nFor Rp /Rn = 1, the ratios of Eqs. (57) and (58) become slightly smaller, namely:\n\u0393n\n\u0393p\n\n5\n\u039b He\n\n\u0393n\n\u0393p\n\n5\n\u039b He\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\n= 0.34+0.47\n\u22120.34\n\n(1B + 2B, Rp /Rn = 1),\n\n(59)\n\n= 0.37+0.40\n\u22120.37\n\n(1B only, Rp /Rn = 1).\n\n(60)\n\nrespectively.\nA similar analysis can be performed on 12\n\u039b C data, again from the BNL experiment\nof Ref. [90]:\nNn\n\u01ebn \u03a9n\n\n12\n\u039bC\n\n\u0001\n\nNp\n\u01ebp \u03a9p\n\n= 3400 \u00b1 1100,\n97\n\n12\n\u039bC\n\n\u0001\n\n= 1410 \u00b1 200.\n\n\fThe calculation of table 12 supplies a ratio \u03932 /(\u0393n + \u0393p ) = 0.2 for\nEq. (50) one obtains:\n\u0393n\n\u0393p\n\n12\n\u039bC\n\n\u0393n\n\u0393p\n\n12\n\u039bC\n\n\u0393n\n\u0393p\n\u0393n\n\u0393p\n\n\u0001\n\nThus, from\n\n= 1.14 \u00b1 0.80\n\n(1B + 2B, Rp /Rn = 1.2),\n\n(61)\n\n= 0.95 \u00b1 0.51\n\n(1B only, Rp /Rn = 1.2),\n\n(62)\n\n= 0.78 \u00b1 0.60\n\n(1B + 2B, Rp /Rn = 1),\n\n(63)\n\n= 0.71 \u00b1 0.43\n\n(1B only, Rp /Rn = 1).\n\n(64)\n\n\u0001\n\n12\n\u039bC\n\n\u0001\n\n12\n\u039bC\n\n12\n\u039b C.\n\n\u0001\n\nAgain, because of the big error bars, the effect of \u03932 on the determination of \u0393n /\u0393p\nwith Eq. (50) is negligible [this also occurs for very large (and unrealistic) values\nof \u03932 ]. In order to have a determination of the ratios of Eqs. (57) and (61) with\nrelative errors of about 20%, Nn and Np must be measured with very small errors:\n\u2206Nn /Nn \u2243 2 \u2206Np /Np \u2243 8%. Thus, to determine \u03932 one must resort to NN correlation measurements, as previously discussed. It is worth noticing that the ratios\nof Eqs. (57)\u2013(60) are considerably smaller than the result published in Ref. [90] for\n5\n\u039b He (\u0393n /\u0393p = 0.93 \u00b1 0.55) and compatible with the OPE calculations. Only sizeable\nfinal state interactions (Rp /Rn \u2243 1.7) can give ratios around 1 by employing Eq. (50)\nfor 5\u039b He. The values of Eqs. (61)\u2013(64), instead, are closer to the published result for\n+1.12\n12\n\u039b C (\u0393n /\u0393p = 1.33\u22120.81 ) and disagree with the OPE calculations within one standard\ndeviation. Interestingly, the ratio of Eq. (50) for 12\n\u039b C becomes equal to the central\ndata point (1.33) when Rp /Rn \u2243 1.3.\n\n6.3\n\nPhenomenological analysis of s\u2013shell hypernuclei\n\nThe analysis of the non\u2013mesonic decays in s\u2013shell hypernuclei offers an important tool\nboth for the solution of the \u0393n /\u0393p puzzle and for testing the validity of the related\n\u2206I = 1/2 rule. Since in these hypernuclei the \u039bN pair is necessarily in the L = 0\nrelative state, the only possible \u039bN \u2192 NN transitions are the following ones (we use\nthe spectroscopic notation 2S+1 LJ ):\n1\n\nS0 \u2192\n\u2192\n3\nS1 \u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\n1\n\nS0\nP0\n3\nS1\n1\nP1\n3\nP1\n3\nD1\n\n3\n\n(If = 1)\n(If = 1)\n(If = 0)\n(If = 0)\n(If = 1)\n(If = 0).\n\n(65)\n\nThe \u039bn \u2192 nn process has final states with isospin If = 1 only, while for \u039bp \u2192 np\nboth If = 1 and If = 0 are allowed.\n98\n\n\fWe discuss in this subsection an analysis performed by the authors of the present\nreview [148] in order to explore the validity of the \u2206I = 1/2 rule in the one\u2013nucleon\ninduced \u039b\u2013decay. This analysis is based on the phenomenological model of Block and\nDalitz [143, 144], which we briefly outline now.\nThe interaction probability of a particle which crosses an infinite homogeneous\nsystem of thickness ds is, classically, dP = ds/\u03bb, where \u03bb = 1/(\u03c3\u03c1) is the mean free\npath of the projectile, \u03c3 is the relevant cross section and \u03c1 is the density of the system.\nThen, if we refer to the process \u039bN \u2192 NN, the width \u0393NM = dP\u039bN \u2192N N /dt can be\nwritten as:\n\u0393NM = v\u03c3\u03c1,\nv = ds/dt being the \u039b velocity in the rest frame of the homogeneous system. For a\nfinite nucleus of density \u03c1(~r), by introducing a local Fermi sea of nucleons, one can\nwrite, within the semiclassical approximation:\nZ\n\u0393NM = hv\u03c3i d~r\u03c1(~r) | \u03c8\u039b (~r) |2 ,\nwhere \u03c8\u039b (~r) is the \u039b wave function in the hypernucleus and hi denotes an average over\nspin and isospin states. In the above equation the nuclear density is normalized to the\nmass number A = N + Z, hence the integral gives the average nucleon density \u03c1A at\nthe position of the \u039b particle. In this scheme, the non\u2013mesonic width \u0393NM = \u0393n + \u0393p\nof the hypernucleus A+1\n\u039b Z turns out to be:\n\u0393NM (A+1\n\u039b Z) =\n\nA+1\nNRn (A+1\n\u039b Z) + ZRp (\u039b Z)\n\u03c1A ,\nA\n\nwhere Rn (Rp ) denotes the spin\u2013averaged rate for the neutron\u2013induced (proton\u2013\ninduced) process appropriate for the considered hypernucleus.\nFurthermore, by introducing the rates RN J for the spin\u2013singlet (Rn0 , Rp0 ) and\nspin\u2013triplet (Rn1 , Rp1 ) elementary \u039bN \u2192 NN interactions, the non\u2013mesonic decay\nwidths of s\u2013shell hypernuclei are [143, 144]:\n\u03c12\n\u0393NM (3\u039b H) = (3Rn0 + Rn1 + 3Rp0 + Rp1 ) ,\n8\n\u03c13\n4\n\u0393NM (\u039b H) = (Rn0 + 3Rn1 + 2Rp0 ) ,\n6\n\u03c13\n4\n\u0393NM (\u039b He) = (2Rn0 + Rp0 + 3Rp1 ) ,\n6\n\u03c14\n5\n\u0393NM (\u039b He) = (Rn0 + 3Rn1 + Rp0 + 3Rp1 ) .\n8\n\n(66)\n\nThese relations take into account that the total hypernuclear angular momentum is\n0 for 4\u039b H and 4\u039b He and 1/2 for 3\u039b H and 5\u039b He. In terms of the rates associated to the\npartial\u2013wave transitions (65), the RN J 's of Eqs. (66) read:\nRn0\nRp0\nRn1\nRp1\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nRn (1 S0 ) + Rn (3 P0 ),\nRp (1 S0 ) + Rp (3 P0 ),\nRn (3 P1 ),\nRp (3 S1 ) + Rp (1 P1 ) + Rp (3 P1 ) + Rp (3 D1 ),\n99\n\n\fthe quantum numbers of the NN final state being reported in brackets. If one assumes\nthat the \u039bN \u2192 NN weak interaction occurs with a change \u2206I = 1/2 of the isospin,\nthe following relations (simply derived by angular momentum coupling coefficients)\nhold among the rates for transitions to I = 1 final states:\nRn (1 S0 ) = 2Rp (1 S0 ), Rn (3 P0 ) = 2Rp (3 P0 ), Rn (3 P1 ) = 2Rp (3 P1 ).\n\n(67)\n\nRn1\nRn0\n\u2264\n= 2.\nRp1\nRp0\n\n(68)\n\nHence:\n\nFor pure \u2206I = 3/2 transitions, the factors 2 in Eqs. (67) are replaced by 1/2. Hence,\nby further introducing the ratio:\nr=\n\nhIf = 1||A1/2 ||Ii = 1/2i\nhIf = 1||A3/2 ||Ii = 1/2i\n\nbetween the \u2206I = 1/2 and \u2206I = 3/2 \u039bN \u2192 NN transition amplitudes for isospin\n1 final states (r being real, as required by time reversal invariance), for a general\n\u2206I = 1/2 \u2212 \u2206I = 3/2 mixture one gets:\n4r 2 \u2212 4r + 1\nRn0\n4r 2 \u2212 4r + 1\nRn1\n= 2\n\u2264\n=\n,\nRp1\n2r + 4r + 2 + 6\u03bb2\nRp0\n2r 2 + 4r + 2\n\n(69)\n\nwhere:\n\u03bb=\n\nhIf = 0||A1/2 ||Ii = 1/2i\n.\nhIf = 1||A3/2 ||Ii = 1/2i\n\n(70)\n\nThe partial rates of Eq. (69) supply the \u0393n /\u0393p ratios for s\u2013shell hypernuclei through\nEqs. (66), which provide the sum \u0393n + \u0393p for each considered hypernucleus. For\nexample, for 5\u039b He one has:\n\u0393n 5\nRn0 + 3Rn1\n(\u039b He) =\n.\n\u0393p\nRp0 + 3Rp1\n\n(71)\n\nBy using Eqs. (66) and (69) together with the available experimental data it is\npossible to extract the spin and isospin behaviour of the \u039bN \u2192 NN interaction without resorting to a detailed knowledge of the interaction mechanism. This reasoning\nwas applied for the first time by Block and Dalitz [143, 144]. Unfortunately, up to\nnow, the large experimental error bars have not allowed to draw definitive conclusions\nabout the validity of the \u2206I = 1/2 rule in non\u2013mesonic decays by employing the previous model. There are indications for a sizeable violation of this rule [147, 149, 150],\nbut more precise measurements are needed, especially for 3\u039b H and 4\u039b H. If confirmed,\nthis would represent the first evidence of such a violation in non\u2013leptonic strangeness\nchanging processes. By using the phenomenological model of Block and Dalitz, in the\nnext paragraph we shall discuss, through a new analysis [148] which employs recent\ndata, the validity of the \u2206I = 1/2 rule in the process \u039bN \u2192 NN.\n100\n\n\fTable 19: Experimental data (in units of \u0393free\n\u039b ) for s\u2013shell hypernuclei (taken from\nRef.

(66) make use of several assumptions, which\ncannot be easily tested: the decays are treated incoherently on the stimulating nucleons within a simple 4\u2013baryons point interaction model, thus interference effects\noriginating from antisymmetrization of the two\u2013nucleon final state as well as final\nstate interactions are neglected. Moreover, the calculation requires the average nuclear density at the \u039b position and does not take into account non\u2013mesonic decays\ninduced by more than one nucleon. However, given the high momentum of the outgoing nucleons and the present level of accuracy of the data, the above approximations\ncan be considered as satisfactory.\n6.3.1\n\nExperimental data and \u2206I = 1/2 rule\n\nIn Ref. [148] a phenomenological analysis of experimental data on non\u2013mesonic decay\nof s\u2013shell hypernuclei is employed to study the possible violation of the \u2206I = 1/2 rule\nin the \u039bN \u2192 NN interaction. In that paper we have analyzed recent data (which\nare summarized in table 19) by using a quite different method with respect to the\nprevious works of Refs. [146, 147, 149].\nUnfortunately, no data are available on the non\u2013mesonic decay of hypertriton and\non \u0393n /\u0393p for 4\u039b H. Indeed, we shall see in the following that the future measurement of\n\u0393n /\u0393p for 4\u039b H at BNL [196] will be of great importance for a test of the \u2206I = 1/2 rule.\nThe BNL data [90, 136] for 4\u039b He and 5\u039b He of table 19 together with the reference value\nfor 4\u039b H have been used in our analysis. This last number is the weighted average of the\nprevious estimates [46, 144], which have not been obtained from direct measurements\nbut rather by using theoretical constraints. One has then 5 independent data which\nallow to fix, from Eqs. (66), the 4 rates RN,J and \u03c13 . Indeed, the average nucleon\ndensity \u03c14 at the \u039b position for 5\u039b He, also entering into Eqs. (66), has been estimated\nto be \u03c14 = 0.045 fm\u22123 by employing the \u039b wave function of Ref. [45] (which was\nobtained through a quark model description of the \u039bN interaction) and the gaussian\ndensity for 4 He that reproduces the experimental mean square radius of the nucleus.\nFor 4\u039b H and 4\u039b He, instead, no realistic hyperon wave function is available and we can\nobtain the value \u03c13 = 0.026 fm\u22123 from the data of table 19, by imposing that [see\nEqs. (66)]:\n\u0393p (5\u039b He)\n3 \u03c14\n.\n=\n4\n\u0393p (\u039b He)\n4 \u03c13\n101\n\n\fThe best choice to determine the rates RN,J by fitting experimental data corresponds to use the relations for the observables:\n\u0393NM (4\u039b H), \u0393NM (4\u039b He), \u0393NM (5\u039b He),\n\n\u0393n 4\n( He),\n\u0393p \u039b\n\nwhich have the smallest experimental uncertainties. After solving these equations\nwe obtained the following partial rates (as usual, the decay widths of Eqs. (66) are\nconsidered in units of the free \u039b decay width):\nRn0\nRp0\nRn1\nRp1\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n(4.7 \u00b1 2.1) fm3 ,\n3\n(7.9+16.5\n\u22127.9 ) fm ,\n(10.3 \u00b1 8.6) fm3 ,\n(9.8 \u00b1 5.5) fm3 ,\n\n(72)\n(73)\n(74)\n(75)\n\n1\n(Rn0 + 3Rn1 ) = (8.9 \u00b1 6.5) fm3 ,\n4\n1\nRp (5\u039b He) \u2261 (Rp0 + 3Rp1 ) = (9.3 \u00b1 5.8) fm3 ,\n4\n\nRn (5\u039b He) \u2261\n\nThe errors have been obtained with the standard formula:\nv\nu N \u0012\nuX \u2202O \u00132\n\u03b4ri ,\n\u03b4[O(r1, . . . , rN )] = t\n\u2202ri\ni=1\n\nnamely by treating the data as independent and uncorrelated. Due to the large\nrelative errors [especially in the measures of \u0393NM (4\u039b H) and \u0393NM (5\u039b He)] implied in the\nextraction of the above rates, the gaussian propagation of the uncertainties has to be\nregarded as a poor approximation.\nFor the ratios of Eq. (69) we have then:\nRn0\n= 0.6+1.3\n\u22120.6 ,\nRp0\n\n(76)\n\nRn1\n= 1.0+1.1\n\u22121.0 .\nRp1\n\n(77)\n\nwhile the ratios of the spin\u2013triplet to the spin-singlet interaction rates are:\nRn1\n= 2.2 \u00b1 2.1,\nRn0\nRp1\n= 1.2+2.7\n\u22121.2 .\nRp0\nThe large uncertainties do not allow to draw definite conclusions about the possible\nviolation of the \u2206I = 1/2 rule and the spin\u2013dependence of the transition rates.\nEqs. (76) and (77) are still compatible with Eq. (68), namely with the \u2206I = 1/2\nrule, although the central value in Eq. (76) is more in agreement either with a pure\n102\n\n\f\u2206I = 3/2 transition (r \u2243 0) or with r \u2243 2 [see Eq. (69)]. Actually, Eq. (76) is\ncompatible with r in the range \u22121/4 \u00f7 40, while the ratio \u03bb of Eqs. (69) and (70) is\ncompletely undetermined.\nBy using the results of Eqs. (72)\u2013(75) we can predict the neutron to proton ratio\nfor 3\u039b H, 4\u039b H and 5\u039b He, which turn out to be:\n\u0393n 3\n( H) = 0.7+1.1\n\u22120.7 ,\n\u0393p \u039b\n\u0393n 4\n( H) = 2.3+5.0\n\u22122.3 ,\n\u0393p \u039b\n\u0393n 5\n( He) = 0.95 \u00b1 0.92,\n\u0393p \u039b\nand, by using \u03c12 = 0.001 fm\u22123 [144],\n\u0393NM (3\u039b H) = 0.007 \u00b1 0.006.\nThe latter is of the same order of magnitude of the detailed 3\u2013body calculation of\nRef. [115], which provides a non\u2013mesonic width equal to 1.7% of the free \u039b width. The\nratio obtained for 5\u039b He is in good agreement with the data of table 19. An accurate\nmeasurement of \u0393NM (3\u039b H) and \u0393n /\u0393p for 3\u039b H and 4\u039b H would then provide a test of the\nweak decay model of Eqs. (66) if the rates of Eqs. (72)\u2013(75) could be extracted with\nless uncertainty from data.\nThe compatibility of the data with the \u2206I = 1/2 rule can be discussed in a different way: by assuming this rule, we fix Rn0 /Rp0 = 2. Then, by using the observables:\n\u0393NM (4\u039b He), \u0393NM (5\u039b He),\n\n\u0393n 4\n( He),\n\u0393p \u039b\n\nthe extracted partial rates (Rn0 , Rn1 , Rn and Rp are unchanged with respect to the\nabove derivation) are:\nRp0\n\nRn0\n\u2261 Rn0 /2\nRn1\nRp1\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n(4.7 \u00b1 2.1) fm3 ,\n(2.3 \u00b1 1.0) fm3 ,\n(10.3 \u00b1 8.6) fm3 ,\n(11.7 \u00b1 2.4) fm3 .\n\nThese values are compatible with the ones in Eqs. (72)\u2013(75). For pure \u2206I = 1/2\ntransitions the spin\u2013triplet interactions seem to dominate over the spin\u2013singlet ones:\nRn1\n= 2.2 \u00b1 2.1,\nRn0\nRp1\n= 5.0 \u00b1 2.4.\nRp0\nMoreover, since:\nRn1\n= 0.9 \u00b1 0.8,\nRp1\n103\n\n\fTable 20: Experimental data for\n\n12\n\u039bC\n\n\u0393NM\n\u0393n /\u0393p\n1.14 \u00b1 0.20 1.33+1.12\n\u22120.81\n0.89 \u00b1 0.18 1.87+0.67\n\u22121.16\n1.01 \u00b1 0.13 1.61+0.57\n\u22120.66\n\n(taken from Ref.

(69) one obtains the following estimate for the ratio between the \u2206I = 1/2\namplitudes:\nhIf = 0||A1/2 ||Ii = 1/2i\n1\n\u2243\n\u00f7 2.3.\nhIf = 1||A1/2 ||Ii = 1/2i\n3.7\nThe other independent observables which here have not been utilized are then predicted to be:\n\u0393NM (4\u039b H) = 0.17 \u00b1 0.11,\nand:\n\u0393n 5\n( He) = 0.95 \u00b1 0.72,\n\u0393p \u039b\nin good agreement with the values of table 19, with a \u03c72 for one degree of freedom of\n0.31 (corresponding to a 0.56 \u03c3 deviation). This means that the data are consistent\nwith the hypothesis of validity of the \u2206I = 1/2 rule at the level of 60%. In other\nwords, the \u2206I = 1/2 rule is excluded at the 40% confidence level.\nThe observables for which experimental data are not available at present are predicted to be:\n\u0393n 3\n( H) = 1.3 \u00b1 0.6,\n\u0393p \u039b\n\u0393n 4\n( H) = 7.6 \u00b1 6.2,\n\u0393p \u039b\nand, for \u03c12 = 0.001 fm\u22123 ,\n\u0393NM (3\u039b H) = 0.005 \u00b1 0.003.\nWe note that the central value of \u0393n /\u0393p for 4\u039b H in the analysis which enforces the\n\u2206I = 1/2 rule is considerably larger than the central value obtained in the general\nanalysis previously discussed. Thus, the future measurement [196] of this quantity\nwill represent an important test of the \u2206I = 1/2 rule.\nWe conclude this subsection by considering a simple extension to hypernuclei of\nthe p\u2013shell. In table 20 the data on weak non\u2013mesonic decay of 12\n\u039b C are quoted. The\nrelevant decay rate can be written in the following form:\n\u0393NM (12\n\u039b C) =\n\n\u0003\n\u03c1p \u0002\n\u03c1s11\n\u0393NM (5\u039b He) + 11 3Rn (p) + 4Rp (p) ,\n\u03c14\n7\n104\n\n(78)\n\n\fwhere \u03c1s11 (\u03c1p11 ) is the mean s\u2013shell (p\u2013shell) nucleon density at the hyperon position,\nwhile Rn (p) [Rp (p)] is the spin\u2013averaged p\u2013shell neutron\u2013induced (proton\u2013induced)\nrate. By using the previous results from s\u2013shell hypernuclei and the weighted average\nvalues in table 20, we obtain:\nRn (p) = (18.3 \u00b1 10.7) fm3 ,\n3\nRp (p) = (3.6+12.6\n\u22123.6 ) fm .\nThe densities \u03c1s11 (= 0.064 fm\u22123 ) and \u03c1p11 (= 0.043 fm\u22123 ) have been calculated from\nthe appropriate nucleon s\u2013 and p\u2013shell Woods\u2013Saxon wave functions. The s\u2013 and\np\u2013shell contributions in Eq. (78) are 0.58 \u00b1 0.20 and 0.43 \u00b1 0.24, respectively. The\ncontribution of the \u039bN P partial waves to \u0393NM is estimated to be only 5 \u00f7 15% in\np\u2013shell hypernuclei [116\u2013118]. Thus, about 10 \u00f7 30% of the 12\n\u039b C p\u2013shell contribution\nis expected to be originated by \u039bN relative states with L = 1.\n\n105\n\n\f7\n7.1\n\nNon\u2013mesonic decay of polarized \u039b\u2013hypernuclei:\nthe asymmetry puzzle\nIntroduction\n\nLambda hypernuclear states can be produced with a sizeable amount of polarization\n[198]. The development of angular distribution measurements of decay particles (photons, pions and protons) from polarized hypernuclei is of crucial importance in order\nto extract new information on hypernuclear production, structure and decay.\nA new open problem, of very recent origin, in the study of the weak hypernuclear\ndecay concerns large discrepancies among the results of two experiments [199, 200],\nperformed at KEK, which observed the asymmetric emission of non\u2013mesonic decay\nprotons from polarized hypernuclei. Theoretical predictions are able to reproduce,\nalthough not very accurately, the older measurement, but very recent observations\nhave completely changed the situation, leading to a puzzling status. We analyze the\nproblem in this section.\nThanks to the large momentum transfer involved, the n(\u03c0 + , K + )\u039b reaction has\n<\n< \u03b8K \u223c\nbeen used, at p\u03c0 = 1.05 GeV and small K + laboratory scattering angles (2\u25e6 \u223c\n\u25e6\n15 ), to produce hypernuclear states with a substantial amount of spin\u2013polarization,\npreferentially aligned along the axis normal to the reaction plane [199, 200]. The\norigin of hypernuclear polarization is twofold [198]. It is known that the distortions\n(absorptions) of the initial (\u03c0 + ) and final (K + ) meson\u2013waves produce a small polarization of the hypernuclear orbital angular momentum up to laboratory scattering\nangles \u03b8K \u2243 15\u25e6 (at larger scattering angles, the orbital polarization increases with a\nnegative sign). At small but non\u2013zero angles, the main source of polarization is due\nto an appreciable spin\u2013flip interaction term in the elementary reaction \u03c0 + n \u2192 \u039bK + ,\nwhich interferes with the spin\u2013nonflip amplitude. In a typical experimental situation\nwith p\u03c0 = 1.05 GeV and \u03b8K \u2243 15\u25e6 , the polarization of the hyperon spin in the free\n\u03c0 + n \u2192 \u039bK + process is about 0.75.\nThe KEK experiment of Ref. [199] measured for the first time the asymmetry of\n~ \u2192 np,\nthe angular distribution of protons produced in the non\u2013mesonic decay, \u039bp\n12\nof polarized p\u2013shell hypernuclei, produced on C target. The difference between the\nnumber of protons emitted along the polarization axis and the number of protons\noutgoing in the opposite direction must be determined. As we shall briefly discuss in\nthe next subsection, this proton asymmetry is related to the interference between the\nparity\u2013violating and parity\u2013conserving transition amplitudes with different values of\nthe NN isospin [27]. Due to the antisymmetry of the NN state, the \u039bN \u2192 NN\nparity\u2013violating and parity\u2013conserving amplitudes correspond to S + I = even and\nS + I = odd final states, respectively (S = spin, I = isospin). This means that the\ninterference terms contributing to the proton asymmetry occur between amplitudes\nwith the same NN intrinsic spin S. The non\u2013mesonic partial rates are dominated\nby the parity\u2013conserving amplitudes. Thanks to the information on the spin\u2013parity\nstructure of the process which can be obtained with the study of the asymmetric\nemission of protons from polarized hypernuclei, new constraints can then be imposed\non the \u039bN \u2192 NN decay mechanism.\n\n106\n\n\f7.2\n\nSpin\u2013polarization observables\n\nIn this subsection we briefly outline the formal derivation of the proton asymmetry\nparameter and its relation with the other spin observables. More details can be\nfound in Ref. [201]. The intensity of protons emitted in the non\u2013mesonic decay of\na polarized hypernucleus along a direction forming an angle \u0398 with the polarization\naxis is defined by:\nI(\u0398, J) \u2261 Tr[M\u03c1(J)M\u2020 ](\u0398)\n=\n\nX\n\nF,M,M \u2032\n\n(79)\n\nhF ; \u0398|M|I; J, MihI; J, M|\u03c1(J)|I; J, M \u2032ihI; J, M \u2032 |M\u2020 |F ; \u0398i.\n\n~ \u2192 np transition, |I; J, Mi is the initial\nHere, M is the operator describing the \u039bp\nhypernuclear state, M denoting the third component of the hypernuclear total spin\nJ, |F ; \u0398i the many\u2013body final state (given by the residual nucleus and the outgoing\nnucleons, with a proton emerging at an angle \u0398) and \u03c1 is the density matrix of the\npolarized hypernucleus.\nWith reference to the (\u03c0 + , K + ) production reaction, the density matrix for pure\nvector polarization along ~k\u03c0 \u00d7 ~kK is given by [201]:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n3\n1\n1 + Py (J) Sy\n,\n(80)\n\u03c1(J) =\n2J + 1\nJ +1\nin the Madison frame, in which the zM \u2013axis is along the direction of the incoming\npion and the yM \u2013axis is along ~k\u03c0 \u00d7 ~kK . In Eq. (80) Py is the hypernuclear polarization\nand Sy the projection along the yM \u2013axis of the spin operator J. From Eq. (79) one\nthen obtains the proton distribution in the form:\nI(\u0398, J) = I0 (J) [1 + A(\u0398, J)] ,\nwhere:\nTr(MM\u2020 )\nI0 (J) =\n2J + 1\nis the (isotropic) intensity for an unpolarized hypernucleus.

The hypernuclear polarization Py depends\nboth on the kinematics (p\u03c0 and \u03b8K ) and dynamics of the production reaction. In\nEq.

The transition amplitudes appearing in Eqs. (79) and\n(83) are evaluated in the proton helicity frame, whose z\u2013axis is along the direction of\nthe outgoing proton.\nIn the shell model weak\u2013coupling scheme with the 1s \u039b\u2013hyperon coupled to the\nnuclear core ground state, Py is directly related to the polarization p\u039b of the \u039b spin\nin the hypernucleus as follows:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\u2212 J P (J) if J = J \u2212 1\ny\nC\n2\n(84)\np\u039b (J) =\nJ +1\n\uf8f3P (J)\n1\nif J = J + ,\ny\n\nC\n\n2\n\nJC being the total spin of the nuclear core. It is useful to introduce an intrinsic\nlambda asymmetry parameter a\u039b , which is characteristic of the elementary process\n~ \u2192 np and should be independent of the hypernucleus, such that:\n\u039bp\nA(\u0398, J) = p\u039b (J) a\u039b cos \u0398.\n\nFrom Eqs.

Moreover, two\u2013nucleon induced decays,\nnot taken into account in the experimental analyses, are expected to contribute.\n~ 12 ~\nIn the first experiment [199], KEK\u2013E160, 11\n\u039b B, \u039b C and other p\u2013shell hypernuclei\nwere produced by the (\u03c0 + , K + ) reaction on 12 C. At about 10 MeV excitation energy\n\u2212\nwith respect to the 12\n\u039b C(1 ) ground state, the reaction can create proton\u2013unbound\n1+\nstates, which then populate the 11\n\u039b B( 2 ) ground state by proton and photon emissions.\nThe high excitation energy region, around 20 MeV, is called quasi\u2013bound region since,\neven if here the \u039b has a finite escape probability, deexcitations via the emission of\none or more nucleons are also possible, and lead to a light hyperfragment (LH) with\nA \u2264 10: for example, the emission of a p, n, d, 3 He or \u03b1 particle produces a final 11\n\u039b B,\n11\n10\n9\n8\nC,\nB,\nBe\nor\nBe\nhypernucleus,\nrespectively.\nThe\nstatistics\nand\nenergy\nresolution\n\u039b\n\u039b\n\u039b\n\u039b\n(5 \u00f7 7 MeV) of the kaon spectrometer were limited at KEK\u2013E160; moreover, the\npolarization of the produced hypernuclei, whose decay protons were observed, had to\nbe evaluated theoretically in order to determine the intrinsic \u039b asymmetry, a\u039b , from\nthe measured A. Such a calculation requires a delicate analysis of 1) the polarization\nof the hypernuclear states directly produced in the (\u03c0 + , K + ) reaction and 2) the\ndepolarization effects due to strong and electromagnetic transitions of the populated\nexcited states, which take place before the weak decay. In table 21 we list the observed\nasymmetries. According to Eq. (85), the proton asymmetry A(0\u25e6 ) should depend\nlinearly on the polarization p\u039b of the hyperon in the nucleus (see second and fourth line\nof the table), which is always positive, reflecting the positive sign of the \u039b polarization\nin the elementary \u03c0 + n \u2192 \u039bK + reaction. The values for the intrinsic \u039b asymmetry,\na\u039b = A(0\u25e6 )/(k p\u039b ), of the third line are obtained by using the theoretical evaluations\nof Py originally employed in the analysis of Ref. [199]. The attenuation factor k,\nestimated to be around 0.8, is due to the \u039b Fermi motion and the rescattering of the\nemitted protons. The main reason of the attenuation in the observed asymmetry is\nthe detection of secondary protons, emitted as a consequence of the scattering of decay\nneutrons and protons with the nucleons of the residual nucleus. By assuming that a\u039b\nis independent of the hypernucleus, the weighted average of the three results supplies\na very large and negative asymmetry: a\u039b = \u22121.3 \u00b1 0.4, namely in the physically\nacceptable range between \u22120.9 and \u22121. In the fifth line of the table, more realistic\nevaluations of the polarization, extracted from Refs. [202\u2013204], are used to obtain a\u039b .\n12 ~\n~\nA weighted average among the improved results for 11\n\u039b B and \u039b C and the original one\n109\n\n\f~\nTable 22: Asymmetries observed at KEK\u2013E278 [200] for 5\u039b He.\nThe values of p\u039b in\nthe third line are taken from Ref.

(84), coincides with the \u039b polarization: Py (5\u039b He)\n\u039b\nThe 6 Li(\u03c0 + , K + )6\u039b Li reaction is used to produce a polarized 6\u039b Li hypernucleus. The\nground state of 6\u039b Li lies above the 5\u039b He + p threshold, thus an 5\u039b He hypernucleus in\nthe 0+ ground state is exclusively produced by the emission of a proton. The polarization of 5\u039b He is measured by observing the asymmetric emission of negative pions\n\u2212\n\u2212\nin its mesonic decay, A\u03c0 = Py A\u03c0y . To obtain the polarization from the observed\n\u2212\n\u2212\nA\u03c0 , A\u03c0y was assumed [206] to be equal to the value for the free \u039b \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 p decay:\n\u03b1\u03c0\u2212 = \u22120.642 \u00b1 0.013 [207]. This approximation is reasonable, since in 5\u039b He the\nhyperon is coupled to a spin\u2013parity 0+ 4 He core. Unfortunately, the small branching\nratio and asymmetry parameter for the mesonic decay of p\u2013shell hypernuclei makes\nsuch a measurement very difficult for these systems.

When compared with an experiment employing a p\u2013shell hypernucleus, the\n~ has evident virtues: the measured hypernuclear polarization is larger and\nuse of 5\u039b He\napproximatively equal to that of the \u039b\u2013hyperon, since J P (4 He) = 0+ ; the nuclear\neffects on the observed asymmetry A are smaller; finally, only the relative S\u2013wave\nin the initial \u039bp system is active. All these features help the theoretical interpretation of data. In table 22 the obtained results are quoted. The proton asymmetry\nA(0\u25e6) has been measured for two K + scattering\u2013angle regions, 2\u25e6 < |\u03b8K | < 7\u25e6 and\n7\u25e6 < |\u03b8K | < 15\u25e6 . The reduction factor, \u01eb = 0.804, is due to the finite acceptance of the\ndecay counter system, while the attenuation factor, k = 0.935, is again due to nuclear\neffects. Both these quantities, estimated through Monte Carlo simulations, and the \u039b\n~ are required in order to derive the intrinsic \u039b asymmetry. A stapolarization in 5\u039b He\ntistical fluctuation caused a remarkable difference between the values of a\u039b in the two\nscattering\u2013angle regions. However, in the hypothesis that this observable depends on\nthe one\u2013body induced non\u2013mesonic decay only, a weighted average is permitted and\nleads to a relatively small, positive value, within 2 standard deviations.\n110\n\n\f~ [200] and p\u2013shell\nThe experiments thus revealed an opposite sign of a\u039b for 5\u039b He\nhypernuclei [199]. This is puzzling, since from its definition one expects a\u039b to be not\nmuch sensitive to the nuclear structure effects: Ref. [201] ([118]) demonstrated that\n~ and 12 C\n~ (see next subsection).\nthis is true within 25% (6%) in a calculation for 5\u039b He\n\u039b\nThe weak coupling scheme is known to be a good approximation for describing the\nground states of \u039b hypernuclei. However, one must note that, in the experiment on p\u2013\nshell hypernuclei, due to the low energy resolution, several excited hypernuclear states\nenter into the game. The procedure used to calculate the hypernuclear polarization in\nthis case is complicated and could have led to an unrealistic value of a\u039b . For example,\nin Ref. [201], a sizeable reduction (increase) of the hypernuclear polarization Py has\n~ 11 ~\nbeen found for 12\n\u039b C (\u039b B) once the spin depolarization of possibly populated excited\nstates of these hypernuclei are taken into account. It is difficult, however, to think that\nthe sign difference is only due to this effect. Also a statistical fluctuation can hardly\ncause such a difference between the two experiments. Another possible explanation,\nsuggested in Ref. [200], could arise from a dominance of the L = 1 \u039bN interaction\nin p\u2013shell hypernuclei. However, this hypothesis is incompatible with calculations\n[116\u2013118] which proved how the \u039bN L = 0 relative state is the dominant one in the\nnon\u2013mesonic decay of those hypernuclei, giving about 85 \u00f7 95% of the total non\u2013\nmesonic rate.\nThe preliminary results of KEK\u2013E307 [194], which employs carbon, silicon and\n~\niron targets, show a large and positive value of a\u039b for 12\n\u039b C within 2 standard deviations:\nthey find a\u039b = 0.85\u00b10.39, in complete disagreement with the outcome of KEK\u2013E160.\nTo improve statistics, in the E307 experiment an analysis of a\u039b including all the non\u2013\n~ 27 ~\nmesonic decay events gated to both the bound and continuum regions of 12\n\u039b C, \u039b Al,\n28~\n~\n\u039b Si and \u039b Fe is in progress. A preliminary result confirms a positive value of a\u039b\n[194] for hypernuclei beyond the s\u2013shell. However, future data analysis as well as\nimproved statistical and systematic uncertainties are needed before this conclusion\ncan be ensured.\n\n7.4\n\nTheory vs experiment\n\nWithin the model of Block and Dalitz [143, 144], discussed in subsection 6.3, the\nintrinsic lambda asymmetry parameter of Eqs.

The use of Eq. (88) to estimate\na\u039b only provides approximate results. Indeed, within the model of Block and Dalitz,\ninterference effects as well as final state interactions of the two outgoing nucleons\nwith the residual nucleus are neglected. However, it is evident from Eq. (88) that\nthe asymmetry is due to the interference between parity\u2013conserving (ap , cp and dp )\nand parity\u2013violating (bp , ep and fp ) \u039bp \u2192 np amplitudes with the same value of\nthe np intrinsic spin S. Hence, interference terms between spin\u2013singlet (J = 0) and\nspin\u2013triplet (J = 1) amplitudes (terms in ap e\u2217p , bp c\u2217p and bp d\u2217p ) enter a\u039b .\nIn table 23 we summarize the calculations of the intrinsic \u039b asymmetry. Previously\ndiscussed experimental data are reported for comparison. All evaluations provide\na negative asymmetry, between \u22120.38 and \u22120.73 for the complete results, in fair\nagreement with the old KEK result of 1992, but in strong disagreement with the\npositive sign revealed by the recent experiments. As expected, the calculations show\na moderate sensitivity of the asymmetry to the details of nuclear structure. The\nwork of Ramos et al. [201] has been performed in a relativistic nuclear model by\napplying formula (82), which defines, through Eq. (86), the intrinsic asymmetry. The\nnuclear matter calculation of Dubach et al. [123] refers to a OME model including\nthe exchange of \u03c0, \u03c1, K, K \u2217, \u03c9, and \u03b7 mesons. In this case, only relative S\u2013wave\ninteractions are considered in the initial \u039bp state; moreover, a\u039b has been calculated\nthrough Eq. (88) by neglecting the above mentioned interference terms between the\nJ = 0 and J = 1 \u039bp \u2192 np transitions. These terms must be included in the\ncalculation, and are quantitatively important: for example, in the OPE calculation\n112\n\n\fof Sasaki et al. [209], the complete formula supplies an asymmetry equal to \u22120.441,\nto compare with the result, \u22120.159 [210], obtained by disregarding the J = 0 \u2013 J = 1\ninterference terms. Incidentally, this approximation is allowed only when the \u039bp \u2192 np\nprocess occurs in free space: more precisely, in free space only a spin\u2013triplet \u039bp\ninitial state contributes to the asymmetry [see Eq. (88)]. Finally, Parre\u00f1o et al. [118]\n~ and 12 C\n~ hypernuclei within a shell model framework with\napplied Eq. (82) to 5\u039b He\n\u039b\na OME transition potential including the exchange of \u03c0, \u03c1, K, K \u2217 , \u03c9, and \u03b7 mesons.\nWe note that these authors find a considerable increase of the asymmetry when the\nK\u2013meson is added to the pion. On the contrary, Sasaki et al. [209] obtained a lower\nasymmetry in the \u03c0 +K calculation with respect to the pure OPE value. However the\nOME and \u03c0 + K+DQ results of the two calculations agree with each another, with\nvalues around \u22120.7. At variance with the above discussed results, the calculation of\nRamos et al. [201] supplies practically the same asymmetry in the OPE and \u03c0 + K\nmodels. The origin of these discrepancies is unknown: the difference among the\nvarious OPE calculations are due to the use of different \u03c0\u039bN form factors and short\nrange correlations for the initial \u039bp and final np states.\nIn conclusion, further investigations are required to clarify the situation: on the\ntheoretical side there seems to be no way (even by forcing the model parameters to\nunrealistic values) to obtain positive asymmetry values [211]; on the experimental\nside the present anomalous discrepancy between different data needs to be resolved.\nIt has been advanced the hypothesis that the asymmetry puzzle could have the same\norigin of the previously discussed puzzle on the \u0393n /\u0393p ratio [200]. At present there\nis no firm evidence of this relation. Indeed, the situation is even more confused\nfor the asymmetry than for the \u0393n /\u0393p ratio: in the former case, the experiments\ncannot provide any guidance for new theoretical speculations. We hope that future\nexperimental studies of the inverse reaction p~n \u2192 p\u039b in free space could help in\ndisentangling the puzzling situation. Indeed, the weak production of the \u039b\u2013hyperon\nthrough the scattering of longitudinally polarized protons on neutron targets can give\na richer and cleaner (with respect to the non\u2013mesonic hypernuclear decay) piece of\ninformation on the \u039b polarization\u2013observables [208].\n\n113\n\n\f8\n\nSummary and perspective\n\nIn this review we have discussed the present status of hypernuclear physics. Beyond an\nextensive and updated description of our present understanding of weak hypernuclear\ndecay processes, which are the main topic of the paper, we have also illustrated some\nphenomenological aspects of the Y N, Y Y interaction and the hypernuclear structure\nand reviewed the reactions which are used to produce hypernuclei.\nMeasurements of the Y N and Y Y cross sections are very difficult to perform,\nbecause of the very short lifetimes of hyperons. As a consequence, the various phenomenological models developed to describe these interactions are not completely\nsatisfactory. One of the major reason of interest on hypernuclear phenomena lies\nthus in the information which can be extracted about the Y N and Y Y interactions\n(both of strong and weak nature, the former being relevant for hypernuclear structure\nstudies and the latter for hypernuclear weak decays).\nFurther, we have introduced the weak decay modes of \u039b\u2013hypernuclei: beyond\nthe mesonic channel, which is observed also for a free \u039b, the hypernuclear decay\nproceeds through non\u2013mesonic processes, mainly induced by one nucleon or by a\npair of correlated nucleons. This channel is the dominant one in medium\u2013heavy\nhypernuclei, where the Pauli principle strongly suppresses the mesonic decay.\nThe results obtained within the various models proposed to describe the mesonic\nand non\u2013mesonic decay rates as well as the asymmetry parameters in the decay of\nthe \u039b\u2013hyperon in nuclei have been thoroughly discussed. The mesonic rates have\nbeen reproduced quite well by calculations performed in different frameworks. The\nnon\u2013mesonic rates have been considered within a variety of phenomenological and\nmicroscopic models, most of them being based on the exchange of a pion between\nthe decaying \u039b and the nucleon(s). More complex meson exchange potentials, as well\nas direct quark models have also been considered for the evaluation of non\u2013mesonic\ndecay rates. In this context, particular interest has been devoted to the partial rates\n\u0393n and \u0393p and to their ratio.\nIn spite of the fact that several calculations have been able to reproduce, already\nat the OPE level, the total non\u2013mesonic width, \u0393N M = \u0393n + \u0393p (+\u03932 ), the values\ntherewith obtained for \u0393n /\u0393p reveal a strong disagreement with the measured central\ndata. Actually, due to the large experimental uncertainties involved in the extraction\nof \u0393n /\u0393p , at present one cannot draw definite conclusions, and different and more\nrefined experimental analysis are required to correct for eventual deficiencies of the\nmodels.\nNotably, the non\u2013mesonic partial rates \u0393n and \u0393p are dominated by parity\u2013\nconserving transition amplitudes. The asymmetric emission of protons from proton\u2013\ninduced non\u2013mesonic decays of polarized hypernuclei is related to the interference between the parity\u2013conserving and parity\u2013violating transition amplitudes to NN states\nwith the same intrinsic spin S. Therefore, the study of the decay asymmetries complements the one of the non\u2013mesonic partial rates, providing, at least in principle,\nnew constraints on the \u039bN \u2192 NN decay mechanism.\nNuclear structure uncertainties are under control, and cannot influence very much\nthe calculation of the hypernuclear observables for the non\u2013mesonic decay. The total\nnon\u2013mesonic widths turn out to be relatively insensitive to the details of the weak\ninteraction model. On the contrary, the ratio \u0393n /\u0393p strongly depends on the decay\n114\n\n\fmechanism. Nevertheless, the OME calculations, including the exchange of mesons\nmore massive than the pion such as the \u03c1, K, K \u2217 , \u03c9 and \u03b7, as well as the (correlated\nor uncorrelated) two\u2013pion exchange models cannot improve the comparison with the\nexperimental \u0393n /\u0393p ratios and decay asymmetries. These evaluations are rather sensitive to the models used for the required meson\u2013baryon\u2013baryon strong and weak\nvertexes. However, only by using rather unrealistic coupling constants it is possible\nto fit, simultaneously, the data on \u0393n + \u0393p and \u0393n /\u0393p for different hypernuclei [211].\nThe OPE mechanism alone is able to reproduce the observed total non\u2013mesonic\nwidths, but strongly underestimates (by about one order of magnitude) the central\ndata for the ratio. Only the K\u2013meson\u2013exchange turned out to be important to\nobtain considerably larger \u0393n /\u0393p ratios, but the central data remains underestimated.\nThe inclusion in the non\u2013mesonic transition potential of quark degrees of freedom\nsuffers from large theoretical uncertainties. The models that implemented direct\nquark interactions in OME calculations found \u0393n /\u0393p values considerably larger than\nthe OPE estimates, also as a result of the K\u2013meson exchange, but problems remains\nin reproducing both the ratio and \u0393n + \u0393p for the considered systems.\nAlthough some of the discussed improvements could represent a step forward\nin the solution of the \u0393n /\u0393p puzzle, further efforts (especially on the experimental\nside) must be invested in order to understand the detailed dynamics of the non\u2013\nmesonic decay. From the theoretical point of view, it is not easy to imagine new\nmechanisms as responsible for the large observed ratios. Very recent experiments at\nKEK have considerably reduced the error bars on \u0393n /\u0393p , by means of single nucleon\nspectra measurements. The new experiments confirmed previous data, with improved\naccuracy. However, in order to avoid possible deficiencies of this kind of observations,\na direct and unambiguous extraction of the ratio is compulsory. As widely discussed in\nthe present review, for such a determination good statistics coincidence measurements\nof the nn and np emitted pairs are required. These correlation measurements will\nalso allow for the identification of the nucleons which come out from the different\none\u2013 and two\u2013nucleon induced processes.\nAs far as the asymmetry parameters are concerned, the situation is even more\npuzzling. Indeed, strong inconsistencies already appear at the experimental level:\nthe two existing experiments revealed an opposite sign of the intrinsic asymmetry\n~ and p\u2013shell hypernuclei. This is in strong contradiction with\nparameter, a\u039b , for 5\u039b He\nthe theoretical expectation of an intrinsic asymmetry which should be, in principle,\nrather insensitive to nuclear structure effects. Some calculations reproduced the first\nmeasurement of a\u039b , which found a large and negative value for p\u2013shell hypernuclei,\n~ The experiments thus cannot\nbut no calculation could obtain a positive value for 5\u039b He.\nprovide any guidance for further theoretical evaluations. Improved experiments, establishing with certainty the sign and magnitude of a\u039b for s\u2013 and p\u2013shell hypernuclei,\nare then strongly awaited.\nWe conclude this work by reminding the reader that hypernuclear physics is 49\nyears old, yet a lot of efforts remain to be done, both experimentally and theoretically,\nin order to fully understand the hyperon dynamics and decay inside the nuclear\nmedium. The impressive progress experienced in the last few years is promising and\nwe hope that it deserves a definite answer to the intriguing open questions which we\nhave illustrated here.\n\n115\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nFruitful and friendly discussions with H.

The NN \u2192 NN interaction can be described through an\neffective potential given by:\nG(r) = g(r)V (r).\n\n(89)\n\nHere g(r) is a two\u2013body correlation function, which vanishes as r \u2192 0 and goes to 1\nas r \u2192 \u221e, while V (r) is the meson exchange potential, which in our case contains \u03c0\nand \u03c1 exchange: V = V\u03c0 + V\u03c1 . A practical and realistic form for g(r) is [179]:\ng(r) = 1 \u2212 j0 (qc r),\n\n(90)\n\nwhere j0 is the Bessel spherical function of order 0. With qc = m\u03c9 \u2243 780 MeV\none gets a good reproduction of realistic NN correlation functions obtained from\nG\u2013matrix calculations. The inverse of qc is indicative of the hard core radius of\nthe interaction. Since there are no experimental indications, the same correlation\nmomentum is generally used for the strong \u039bN interaction. On the other hand, we\nremind the reader that qc is not necessarily the same in the two cases, given the\ndifferent nature of the repulsive forces involved. Using the correlation function (90)\nit is easy to get the effective interaction, Eq. (89), in momentum space. It reads:\nGN N \u2192N N (q) = V\u03c0 (q) + V\u03c1 (q) +\n\nf\u03c02\n{gL (q)q\u0302i q\u0302j + gT (q)(\u03b4ij \u2212 q\u0302i q\u0302j )} \u03c3i \u03c3j ~\u03c4 * ~\u03c4 ,\nm2\u03c0\n\nwhere the correlations are embodied in the functions gL and gT . Then, the spin\u2013\nisospin NN \u2192 NN interaction can be separated into a spin\u2013longitudinal and a\nspin\u2013transverse parts, as follows:\nGN N \u2192N N (q) = {VL (q)q\u0302i q\u0302j + VT (q)(\u03b4ij \u2212 q\u0302i q\u0302j )} \u03c3i \u03c3j ~\u03c4 * ~\u03c4\n\n(q\u0302i = qi / | ~q |),\n\nwhere:\nVL (q) =\n\nVT (q) =\n\nf\u03c02 \b 2 2\n~q F\u03c0 (q)G0\u03c0 (q) + gL (q) ,\n2\nm\u03c0\n\nf\u03c02 \b 2\n~q C\u03c1 F\u03c12 (q)G0\u03c1 (q) + gT (q) .\nm2\u03c0\n\nIn the above, F\u03c0 and F\u03c1 are the \u03c0NN and \u03c1NN form factors, respectively, while G\u03c0\nand G\u03c1 are the corresponding free meson propagators: G0m = 1/(q02 \u2212 q~ 2 \u2212 m2m ).\nThe \u039bN \u2192 NN transition potential, modified by the effect of the strong \u039bN\ncorrelations, splits into a P \u2013wave (again spin\u2013longitudinal and spin\u2013transverse) part:\nn\no\nG\u039bN \u2192N N (q) = P\u0303L (q)q\u0302i q\u0302j + P\u0303T (q)(\u03b4ij \u2212 q\u0302i q\u0302j ) \u03c3i \u03c3j ~\u03c4 * ~\u03c4 ,\n117\n\n\fwith:\nf\u03c0 P \b 2 2\n~q F\u03c0 (q)G0\u03c0 (q) + gL\u039b (q) ,\nm\u03c0 m\u03c0\n\nP\u0303L (q) =\n\n(91)\n\nf\u03c0 P \u039b\ng (q),\nm\u03c0 m\u03c0 T\n\n(92)\n\no\nf\u03c0 n 2\nS F\u03c0 (q)G0\u03c0 (q) \u2212 F\u0303\u03c02 (q)G\u03030\u03c0 (q) | ~q | .\nm\u03c0\n\n(93)\n\nP\u0303T (q) =\nand an S\u2013wave part:\nS\u0303(q) =\n\nForm factors and propagators with a tilde imply that they are calculated by replacing\n~q 2 \u2192 ~q 2 + qc2 , while C\u03c1 is given by:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nf\u03c12 f\u03c02 \u22121\nC\u03c1 = 2\n.\n(94)\nm\u03c1 m2\u03c0\nThe expressions for the correlation functions are the following ones:\n\u001b\n\u001a\n2\n1 2\n2\ngL (q) = \u2212 ~q + qc F\u0303\u03c02 (q)G\u03030\u03c0 (q) \u2212 qc2 C\u03c1 F\u0303\u03c12 (q)G\u03030\u03c1 (q),\n3\n3\n\u001a\n\u001b\n2 2\n1 2 2\n0\n2\ngT (q) = \u2212 qc F\u0303\u03c0 (q)G\u0303\u03c0 (q) \u2212 ~q + qc C\u03c1 F\u0303\u03c12 (q)G\u03030\u03c1 (q),\n3\n3\n\ngL\u039b (q)\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1 2\n2\n= \u2212 ~q + qc F\u0303\u03c02 (q)G\u03030\u03c0 (q),\n3\n\n1\ngT\u039b (q) = \u2212 qc2 F\u0303\u03c02 (q)G\u03030\u03c0 (q).\n3\nThe functions gL and gT [gL\u039b and gT\u039b ] have been obtained from Eqs. (89) and (90) with\nV = V\u03c0 + V\u03c1 [V = V\u03c0 ]. Using the set of parameters:\nqc = 780 MeV, \u039b\u03c0 = 1.2 GeV, \u039b\u03c1 = 2.5 GeV, f\u03c02 /4\u03c0 = 0.08, C\u03c1 = 2,\nat zero energy and momentum we have:\ngL\u039b (0) = gT\u039b (0) = 0.155,\n\ngL (0) = gT (0) = 0.615,\n\nwhich can be identified with the customary Landau\u2013Migdal parameters. However,\n\u039b\nif one wishes to keep the zero energy and momentum limit of gL,T and gL,T\nas free\nparameters, a replacement of the previous functions by:\ngL,T (q) \u2192 g \u2032\n\ngL,T (q)\n,\ngL,T (0)\n\n\u039b\ngL,T\n(q) \u2192 g\u039b\u2032\n\n118\n\n\u039b\ngL,T\n(q)\n,\n\u039b\ngL,T (0)\n\n\fis required.\nNow we come to the implementation of the above spin\u2013isospin effective potentials\nin the nuclear matter \u039b self\u2013energy of Eq. (9).

The function U =\nU ph + U \u2206h + U 2p2h contains the p\u2013h, \u2206\u2013h and irreducible 2p\u20132h proper polarization\npropagators. Now we must include in the previous equation the repulsive correlations\nin the lines connecting weak and strong vertices. For the P \u2013wave interaction this\ncorresponds to perform the replacement:\nf\u03c0 P 2 2\n~q F\u03c0 (q)G0\u03c0 (q)q\u0302i q\u0302j \u2192 P\u0303L (q)q\u0302i q\u0302j + P\u0303T (q)(\u03b4ij \u2212 q\u0302i q\u0302j ),\nm\u03c0 m\u03c0\nwhile the interaction which connects the S\u2013wave weak vertex and the P \u2013wave strong\nvertex becomes:\nf\u03c0\nSF 2 (q)G0\u03c0 (q) | ~q | q\u0302i \u2192 S\u0303(q)q\u0302i .\nm\u03c0 \u03c0\nThe functions P\u0303L , P\u0303T and S\u0303 are given by equations (91), (92) and (93). Moreover,\nthe polarization propagator U in the modified Eq. (95) has to be understood as UL\nwhen multiplied by a spin\u2013longitudinal potential (VL , P\u0303L , S\u0303), while it is UT when\nmultiplied by VT or P\u0303T . By introducing these prescriptions in Eq. (95) and summing\nthe two geometric series (there is no interference between longitudinal and transverse\nmodes) one obtains:\nZ\nd4 q\n2 2\n\u03a3\u039b (k) = 3i(Gm\u03c0 )\nGN (k \u2212 q)\u03b1(q),\n(2\u03c0)4\nwith \u03b1(q) given by Eq. (13). Then, integrating over q0 , for the \u039b decay width one\nfinally obtains Eq. (12).\n\n119\n\n\fReferences\n[1] M. Danysz and J. Pniewski, Philos. Mag. 44 (1953) 348.\n[2] J. Haidenbuaer, K.
