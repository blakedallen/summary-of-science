Introduction\nIf our universe is described by string/M theory, there exist six or seven extra dimensions\nof space, not yet detected by experiment. This is possible because the extra dimensions\ncan take the form of a small, compact manifold X. A basic question in string/M theory\nis to know what types of manifold are allowed, and to find general relations between their\ngeometry and physics. In the present state of the art, this is generally done by solving the\nequations of motion for the supergravity theory which describes the low energy limit, and\nthen taking into account various stringy and quantum effects.\nThe first works on string compactification assumed that some supersymmetry is preserved at the compactification scale, for good physical and mathematical reasons. Well\nknown physical arguments suggest low energy supersymmetry; supersymmetry favors stability; and supersymmetry places strong constraints on the local geometry of X. In the\nbest studied cases, X is a complex K\u00e4hler manifold, so powerful techniques of algebraic\ngeometry are available for the analysis.\nMore recently, there has been a shift towards techniques which do not assume supersymmetry. After all, supersymmetry is broken in our universe, and we don't know at\nwhat scale it is broken. String/M theory suggests many other solutions to the hierarchy\nproblem, such as large extra dimensions [4] or warped hierarchies [29]. Or, the hierarchy\nmight simply be a chance property, following from a lucky tuning of parameters in a small\nsubset of vacua. Given a measure factor (a probability distribution over vacua), presumably emerging from early cosmology, it might turn out that this class of compactifications\noutweighs those with low energy supersymmetry [14, 33].\nAnother reason to be interested in compactifications without supersymmetry is to get\nmodels of inflation, because the required positive vacuum energy breaks supersymmetry.\nIndeed this is a reason to study not just vacua, meaning long-lived compactifications to\nmaximally symmetric space-times, but the dynamics on the larger configuration space\nwhich contains the vacua.\nAt present the main technique for addressing any of these questions is to start from a\nclass of compactifications, say with a specific choice of topology for the compact manifold\nX, and derive a four (or d) dimensional effective field theory which describes theories within\nthis class. One begins by identifying various \"pseudo-moduli fields\" such as metric moduli,\nbrane positions and the like, which parameterize the vacua within this class. One then\nderives an effective potential, which is a function of the these fields. This is usually done by\ncombining various exact results for related supersymmetric compactifications, brane worldvolume theories, and supersymmetric quantum field theories, in a first approximation by\nadding them, and then considering corrections.\nHaving derived an effective potential, one then looks for its local minima. The first\nissue is that, since the potential always goes to zero at large volume and weak coupling\n[13, 22], one must find effects that produce a barrier to this runaway. Having done this,\nthe easiest way to argue that local minima exist at finite moduli is to show that, to a good\napproximation, the effective potential in the regime under study is a sum of many different,\nloosely correlated, contributions from different sources: fluxes, branes, quantum effects,\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fcurvature, and so on. By approximately balancing two or three of these contributions and\nthen tuning their precise strengths, one can obtain potentials with local minima.\nOne important conclusion from this work is that there is no particular obstacle within\nstring theory to realizing de Sitter space-time [25], and thus the small observed dark energy\ncould be a cosmological constant. Indeed, given that one can obtain local minima with a\nsmall negative vacuum energy, compared to the individual contributions, it would seem that\nonly an incredible conspiracy between the different effects would prevent one from obtaining\nsimilar vacua with small positive vacuum energy. In relatively simple and controllable\nmodels such as the explicit KKLT realizations of [10], one could in principle get enough\ncontrol to rule out such conspiracies. In practice, one brings in some physical intuition at\nthis point, using arguments such as parametric separation of energy scales of different effects\n(so they cannot always cancel) or spatial separation of effects from different regions in X.\nCombining these arguments with the lack of any proposed mechanism for the supposed\nconspiracy, the conclusion seems well enough justified, though better arguments would\ncertainly be welcome.\nThis general approach and many examples are reviewed in [15]. It is very effective\nin determining general structure and relations between parameters such as masses and\ncoupling constants; for example the general differences between IIb, IIa, large volume and\nheterotic compactifications are all readily understandable in these terms. One can also show\nthat certain classes of models cannot contain vacua, or cannot realize slow-roll inflation\n[24], because of runaways to large volume or weak coupling. Other reasons to develop this\napproach are that it could in principle be generalized to nongeometric compactifications,\nand finally it is the best we can hope to do for the vast majority of compactifications.\nOnce one grants the validity of the effective action, the question of the existence of\nvacua with positive vacuum energy, and even general nonsupersymmetric vacua, becomes in\nprinciple straightforward to answer. It also leads to a simple picture of dynamics. The best\nstudied example is the dynamics of inflation, which can be realized by slowly rolling down\na nearly flat potential. More recently, models have been suggested which take advantage of\nother structure, such as in the kinetic terms [3]. Although one expects the effective action\npicture to break down at high energies, in the best case at the (higher dimensional) Planck\nscale, this can still be well above the energy scale of slow-roll inflation.\nOne problem with the effective potential approach is that string theory and even simple\nKaluza-Klein reduction involve an infinite set of fields, while the usual truncation to the\npseudo-moduli fields is somewhat ad hoc. Although there is a simple argument that one\ncan solve the equations of motion for massive fields in terms of light fields, this ignores\nthe possibility of tachyonic modes, which will destabilize vacua. A candidate vacuum for\npresent-day physics must be tachyon-free, while configurations with tachyons are important\nfor cosmology. In dynamical situations in which fields undergo large variations, of course\nthe splitting of fields into \"massless\" and \"massive\" can change drastically.\nThere are simple arguments that massive modes are under control, but these tend to\nuse supersymmetry. For example, one often builds up an effective potential by combining\nsectors which individually respect different supersymmetries. Another simple argument is\nthat, even after supersymmetry breaking, the effective potential is approximately a sum\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fof squares, up to corrections of order F/MP2 lanck . Such arguments seem believable given\na hierarchy between the supersymmetry breaking scale and the masses of the new modes,\nbut are not convincing otherwise.\nA second level of analysis in which one can see the massive modes is to solve the full\n9 + 1 or 10 + 1-dimensional supergravity field equations, or the beta function conditions\nfor a conformal world-sheet theory, or perhaps even the full string field theory equations\nof motion. These various approaches include more and more modes at the cost of eventual\nintractability. Of course, one does not need an exact solution for all the modes; even the\nanalysis of linearized fluctuations of massive modes around a solution would go a long way\ntowards answering the stability question.\nA problem with these approaches is that they are classical (from the point of view of\nspace-time), while the existing constructions of vacua usually rely on quantum corrections\nfor stability and supersymmetry breaking. To try to address this problem, one can note\nthat, despite being formulated in higher dimensions or with string fields, we can still think\nof these approaches as each based on an effective potential, essentially defined as the\nhigher dimensional part of the action, but now taken as a function of all of the massless\nand massive modes. The higher dimensional equations of motion correspond to solving\nthe condition \u2202V /\u2202\u03c6i = 0, while the linearized stability analysis simply corresponds to\ncomputing the mass matrix \u2202 2 V /\u2202\u03c6i \u2202\u03c6j . To the extent that one can make this idea\nprecise, one can then try to deal with quantum corrections by the same prescription which\nwas used before, namely to simply add them in, or make other corresponding adjustments of\nthe effective potential. We could refer to this entire class of approaches as \"semiclassical,\"\nto be contrasted with a fully nonperturbative approach such as gauge-gravity duality, which\nunfortunately is not known to exist for theories with positive vacuum energy.\nSince in the supergravity limit, a vacuum is a solution of well understood higher dimensional equations of motion, the problem of constructing an effective potential which\ntakes massive modes into account is in principle just one of isolating the appropriate terms\nin the original action. Following up on works such as [34, 21, 9], in [23] Giddings and\nMaharana proposed an effective potential, based on reinterpreting the constraint in the\nEinstein equations. They went on to show that it worked in examples such as that of [21].\nWhile we did not know about this proposal during the course of our work, and only\nfound out about it after having distributed our work as a preprint, in general we followed a\nsimilar approach, and obtained an effective potential consistent with that of [23], but with\nmany differences in our discussion. We show explicitly that a critical point of the potential\nsolves all the equations of motion, and we have eliminated the implicit assumption that\nspace-time is Minkowski made at various points in [23]. Another difference is that the two\nproposals use different conventions for the warp factor. The conventions followed here have\nthe great advantage that the constraint becomes linear, enabling us to go on and better\nunderstand the physics in \u00a73 and \u00a74.\nOn further consideration of the resulting effective potential, one realizes that there is\na significant problem with its interpretation, which we now explain.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\f1.1 Questions addressed in this work\nIn this work we develop the analysis of compactifications starting from the equations of\nmotion of general relativity coupled to the type of matter sectors which appear in maximal\nsupergravity theories, including possible stringy corrections. We believe that the same\nideas would apply to any of the semiclassical approaches, if we understood the relevant\nconfiguration spaces.\nSome issues which we try to shed light on include:\n\u2022 The definition of the four (or d) dimensional effective potential. While it is in principle\nclear how to define this for a compactified field theory (not including gravity), this\nis not the case once gravity is included. Indeed, there are well-known difficulties in\nmaking a global definition of energy in general relativity [37]. The usual response in\nthis context (as in [15]) is to work in approximately asymptotically flat backgrounds,\nand appeal to the standard definition for this case. This is obviously not satisfactory\nwhen doing cosmology.\nOne particularly interesting contribution to the effective potential is minus the integral of the scalar curvature of the compactification manifold,\nZ\n1 \u221a (k)\nVef f = \u2212\ngR .\n(1.1)\n2\nThis term can be obtained by the general procedure we just discussed, of regarding\nthe higher dimensional part of the action as an effective potential, as we will review\nin section \u00a72 (see Eq. (2.11)). At least naively, it is responsible for anticorrelating\nthe curvature of the compactification manifold with that of space-time, as in the\nwell-known AdS p \u00d7 S q solutions. While there are additional terms in the Einstein\nequation and this is oversimplified, at first sight it seems reasonable to think of this\nas one of the many terms in the effective potential.\nHowever, a serious problem with this interpretation of Eq. (1.1) is that the integral of\nthe scalar curvature can be made arbitrarily large and positive, by making a rapidly\nvarying conformal transformation of the metric. Thus, Eq. (1.1) is unbounded below,\nand does not even have local minima. This problem is closely related to the fact\nthat the action in Euclidean gravity is unbounded below, and to the \"wrong sign\nkinetic term\" for the conformal factor which may be familiar from minisuperspace\ntreatments of gravity. As such, one would expect that it is solved (at least classically)\nby imposing the appropriate constraints. In particular, in the canonical formulation,\nthe Hamiltonian constraint must be imposed at each point in space, and determines\nthe conformal factor in terms of the other fields. At least in asymptotically flat spacetimes, the resulting energy would be non-negative, by the positive energy theorem\n[31, 38].\nHowever, it is not so clear how the Hamiltonian constraint solves this problem, because it directly determines only the conformal factor on D \u2212 1-dimensional space,\nleaving the conformal factor on X free to vary. It corresponds to the \"warp factor\"\nconstraint in the existing analyses, which is a clue to the physical interpretation.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fIs the potential Eq. (1.1) bounded below, and if so why? If it is, what determines the\ncorrect conformal factor with which to evaluate it? Can we solve for this variable to\nsimplify the potential?\n\u2022 The nature of the warp factor constraint. In doing Kaluza-Klein reduction, the ddimensional part of the Einstein equation (in fact, the Hamiltonian constraint) turns\ninto a partial differential equation for the warp factor. By analysis of this equation, in\n[11, 27] it was shown that one cannot realize de Sitter space-time in pure supergravity,\ni.e. without stringy corrections or singularities. Later it was argued [21, 12] that this\ncould be evaded using orientifolds and/or \"0-form flux\" (the Romans mass term in\nIIa supergravity), and this is no longer considered a major obstacle.\nAs the warp factor plays such an important role in the physics, perhaps even solving\nthe hierarchy problem, it would be nice to have a better conceptual understanding\nof it. Are there other conditions for this constraint to have a solution? What if the\nvarious sources to it are large, or widely separated on X ? What if the sources evolve\nin time?\n\u2022 The possibility of compactification on negatively curved manifolds, and the nature of\nflux or other effects needed to stabilize negative curvature. According to Eq. (1.1),\nnegative scalar curvature makes a positive contribution to the vacuum energy, which\ncould make de Sitter space easier to realize. This point has been particularly emphasized by Silverstein, who has proposed a variety of constructions of this type [30, 32].\nThere are many other works on the subject, including [8].\nNow, the no-go theorems of [11, 27] do not make any assumption about the curvature,\nand would hold in this case as well. Thus, even with negative curvature, one still\nneeds to call on stringy effects to get de Sitter compactifications. Is negative curvature\nactually relevant for this, and if so why? Perhaps consistent compactifications of this\ntype are always dual to others of more familiar types?\nThe possibility of compactification on negatively curved manifolds raises another\npoint, which is that there are far more of these than manifolds of zero or positive\ncurvature. This is illustrated by the familiar example of Riemann surfaces, for which\nthe curvature is proportional to the Euler characteristic \u03c7 = 2 \u2212 2g, and is true in\nhigher dimensions as well. If such manifolds could be used to get compactifications\nwith negative or small positive vacuum energy, it seems almost inevitable that they\nwould dominate the landscape.\nIn this work, we will give an explicit expression for the effective potential in supergravity compactifications, Eq. (3.1), mostly answering the first two questions, and making\na start on the third.\nBesides understanding solutions, another important application of an effective potential is to study time dependence. In particular, slow-roll inflation can be described as\ngradient descent. With this potential, this leads to equations similar to the Ricci flow\nequations, as we will discuss elsewhere. We might also hope that this will shed light on the\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fdeeper questions regarding the existence of the effective potential raised by Banks in [5],\nor on the old problem of the conformal factor in Euclidean quantum gravity.\n\n2.

In the following, we will use this freedom to consider all\nbackground fluxes as magnetic fluxes (so, F0... = 0), just to simplify the discussion.\nWe consider compactification on a k = D \u2212 d-dimensional compact manifold M to\nd-dimensional maximally symmetric space-time (Minkowski, AdS, dS). Whenever there is\nany ambiguity, we superscript the metric and curvatures with the dimension of space-time\nD, k or d. We superscript forms with their rank \u2013 since forms can be pulled back, generally\nthere is no ambiguity.\nWe make a Kaluza-Klein warped metric ansatz,\nds2 = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd e2A(y) dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + gij (y)dy i dy j .\n\n(2.4)\n\nHere \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd is a maximally symmetric metric in d dimensions, which could be dS, AdS or\nMinkowski, and gij is a metric on M .\nOur goal is to write a d-dimensional effective action,1\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ q\n1 (d) 1\na\nb\n(d)\n(d)\n(2.5)\nR \u2212 Gab (\u03c6)\u2202\u03c6 \u2202\u03c6 \u2212 2Vef f (\u03c6) + . . . ,\nS =\n\u2212g\nGN\n2\nwhose equations of motion agree with the KK reduction of the D-dimensional Einstein\nequations.

We would then substitute these expressions\ninto the k-dimensional part of the action, do the integral over X and reinterpret the results\nas terms in Eq. (2.5). Any term with no space-time derivatives would become part of the\neffective potential.\nThe main difficulty in doing explicit mode expansions is to diagonalize the various\nLaplacians on X which appear as kinetic terms. In a mathematical sense this step is\nwell understood, and is not directly relevant for our purposes. Since we do not need to\ndiagonalize the metric Gab (\u03c6) on field space, any complete basis for functions on X would\nsuffice. Thus, we can regard the D-dimensional fields as generating functions for the totality\nof massive modes in the d-dimensional compactified theory.\n2.2 Einstein equations\nThe subtleties we are concerned with appear elsewhere, and can be seen by reviewing the\nstandard discussion of compactification based on the D-dimensional Einstein equations.\nSince these look rather different in d and k dimensions, we consider the two components\nseparately. The d-dimensional components can be written\n1\n1\n(d)\n(d)\n+ g\u03bc\u03bd R(k)\nR\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd R(d) = T\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n2\n\n(2.8)\n\nand we would like to interpret the right-hand side as an effective d-dimensional stress\ntensor. Since the d dimensions have maximal symmetry, we lose nothing by taking the\ntrace,\n\u2212\n\nd \u2212 2 (d)\nd\nR = T (d) + R(k)\n2\n2\n= \u2212d * \u039b\n\n(2.9)\n(2.10)\n\nThe right hand side of this equation defines an effective cosmological constant,\n1\n\u039b = T00 \u2212 R(k) ,\n2\n\n(2.11)\n\nwith a contribution from the curvature of X. To get a d-dimensional equation, we then\nintegrate over X, producing Eq. (1.1). More precisely, all three terms depend on the volume\nof X, which will lead to the dependence on Newton's constant 1/GN in the result.\nFor standard (classical) sources of energy, except for negative potential energy (which\nis not present in the string/M theory case), T00 \u2265 0, so naively one might expect de Sitter\nto be easy to realize. On the other hand, the scalar curvature also contributes, so one needs\nto decide which effect is more important.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fThe k-dimensional curvature can be determined by using the D-dimensional trace of\nthe Einstein equation,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nD\n1\u2212\nR = T (d) + T (k) ,\n(2.12)\n2\nto solve for R in Eq. (2.2), obtaining\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nRij = Tij \u2212\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\ngij T (d) + T (k) .\nD\u22122\n\n(2.13)\n\nTaking the trace, one sees that the sign of R(k) is correlated to that of T (k) , while the\nT (d) = \u2212dT00 contribution now favors positive internal curvature. Thus, the effects of T (d)\nin the two equations conflict with each other.\nSolving for R(k) and substituting back into Eq. (2.11), we get\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 d \u2212 2 (k)\nk\n(d)\n\u039b = T00 \u2212\nT \u2212\nT\n(2.14)\n2 D\u22122\nD\u22122\nd\u22122\n(d \u2212 2)(k \u2212 2)\nT00 \u2212\nT (k) .\n(2.15)\n=\u2212\n2(D \u2212 2)\n2(D \u2212 2)\nEvidently the total effect of T00 always favors AdS, with the only hope for dS being to have\nT (k) very negative compared to T00 , more precisely\nT (k) < \u2212(k \u2212 2)T00 .\n\n(2.16)\n\nNow, taking magnetic flux F0... = 0 in Eq. (2.3), we have\nk\nT (k) = (p \u2212 )F 2 = (2p \u2212 k)T00 .\n2\n\n(2.17)\n\nThus, this condition will never hold for any p \u2265 1, or sums of such stress-tensors.\nThus, de Sitter space-time can only be realized if the matter stress tensor violates the\nstrong energy condition [37], which is\n0 \u2264 R00 = T00 \u2212\n\n1\ng00 T.\nD\u22122\n\n(2.18)\n\nTerms which violate this condition include positive potential energy, certain string/M theory corrections, and the p = 0 flux which appears in massive IIa supergravity. Conceptually,\nthis is the statement that the strong energy condition is preserved under restriction; if it\nholds on M \u00d7 X then it will hold on M [19, 20]. This no-go theorem was independently\nrediscovered by deWit-Hari Dass-Smit [11] and Maldacena-Nunez [27].\nComing back to Eq. (2.11), while it might seem that we have justified Eq. (1.1), there\nis an issue. We needed to use the D-dimensional Einstein equation Eq. (2.2) in order to\ndetermine R(k) . On the other hand, the effective potential was supposed to be defined\nindependently of solving the d or D-dimensional Einstein equation, so it is not clear that\nEq. (1.1) can be interpreted in this way.\nCertainly, we cannot interpret Eq. (2.15) as an effective potential. This is clear from\nthe nontrivial factor in the relation between T00 and \u039b, which even has the wrong sign.\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fThis factor arose because we solved various equations of motion, including Eq. (2.2), and\nsubstituted the solutions. While the final results are correct, identifying terms in partial\nresults with terms in an effective action is usually not.\nWe could correctly identify the curvature term in Eq. (2.11) with a term Eq. (1.1) in\nthe d-dimensional effective potential, if we could do this without solving any equations of\nmotion. However, we cannot simply relax Eq. (2.2), as part of it (the G00 component)\nis in fact a constraint. As we mentioned in the introduction, if we do not enforce this\nconstraint, the Einstein action and thus the potential Eq. (1.1) is unbounded below and\nhas no local minima. To see this, evaluate Eq. (1.1) (using the results in the appendix) for\nthe conformally transformed metrics\ng\u0303ij = e2B gij ,\n\n(2.19)\n\nobtaining\nVef f\n\n1\n=\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u0011\n\u221a (k\u22122)B \u0010\n\u2212R(k) [g] \u2212 (k \u2212 2)(k \u2212 1)(\u2207B)2 ,\nge\n\n(2.20)\n\nwith the wrong sign for the derivative term.\nNow it is true that the potential in gravity and supergravity is often unbounded below,\nbut only to one or a few directions in field space. On the other hand, with a negative definite\nspatial derivative term, every short wavelength perturbation of the conformal factor is\ntachyonic, so the theory would be completely unstable. Somehow, this problem must be\nfixed by incorporating the constraints of the D-dimensional theory.\nHaving seen the problem, it is not hard to come up with a strategy for dealing with\nit. The constraints have two parts, a \"zero mode\" part and a \"non-zero mode\" part. The\nformer become constraints in the d-dimensional theory, while the latter need to be solved\nin the process of dimensional reduction.\n2.3 Incorporating the warp factor\nWe now study the dependence of the action on the warp factor, and consider the general\nwarped ansatz\nds2 \u2261 g\u0303AB dxA dxB = e2A(y) \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + e2B(y) gij dy i dy j .\n\n(2.21)\n\nWe denote the metric with A = B = 0 as gAB , and the metric Eq. (2.21) as g\u0303AB .\nAs B is redundant with gij , for now we will take B = 0, until we are ready to discuss\nthis part of the problem. Using the results in the appendix, the k-dimensional part of the\nEinstein equations becomes\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd(d + 1)\n1 \u22122A (d)\n(k)\n(k) 1\n(k)\n2\n2\ne\nR \u2212 d\u2207 A \u2212\n(\u2207A) .\nRij \u2212 gij R = Tij +d\u2207i \u2207j A+d\u2207i A\u2207j A+gij\n2\n2\n2\n(2.22)\nThe d-dimensional trace Eq. (2.9) becomes\n\u2212\n\nd \u2212 2 \u22122A (d)\nd2 (d \u2212 1)\nd\ne\nR + d(d \u2212 1)\u22072 A +\n(\u2207A)2 = T (d) + R(k) .\n2\n2\n2\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n(2.23)\n\n\fwith\nT (d) = \u2212\n\nd X (p) 2\n(d)\n|F | + Tstring\n2 p\n\n(2.24)\n\n(d)\n\nAt this point we have added the term Tstring which represents the non-classical sources\npresent in superstring theory. We will not use its detailed form, only the fact that it allows\nviolating the inequality T (d) \u2264 0.\n\u03b1A\nNote that, except for R(d) , every term in Eq. (2.23) comes with\np the same weight e\nwith \u03b1 = 0.2 This dependence has only two sources: the overall g (d) , which sits in front\nof every term, and explicit factors of the d-dimensional metric g\u03bc\u03bd or its inverse. However,\nsince every term is a scalar in space-time, and does not contain d-dimensional derivatives,\n(d)\nthe d-dimensional metric cannot appear. This also includes sources in Tstring which are\nspace-time scalars. While the argument we just gave does not cover Chern-Simons terms\nor electric field strengths, they also have the same weight, as we argue in \u00a72.7.\nEq. (2.23) can be dramatically simplified by the change of variable\nu \u2261 edA/2 ,\n\n(2.25)\n\nand becomes\n\u2212\n\nd \u2212 2 (d) 1\u22124/d\nR u\n= \u22122(d \u2212 1)\u22072 u +\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nd (k)\nR + T (d) u.\n2\n\n(2.26)\n\nThis change of variables is used to great advantage in related mathematical work, on the\nYamabe problem [26] and in Perelman's entropy functional [28]. Readers who have looked\nat this, or at Tseytlin's discussion of an entropy functional for sigma models [35] will\nrecognize many ingredients of the following discussion, for example Eq. (3.14).\n2.4 Effective potential\nWe seek a functional of u and gij (and matter fields) whose variation produces the two\nEinstein equations. Let us try direct substitution of the ansatz into the D-dimensional\naction. We continue to take B = 0, then\n\u0013\nZ p \u0012\n1 (p) 2\n(D)\n\u2212 |F |\ng\u0303 R\u0303\nSef f,R =\n(2.27)\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nu2 (p) 2\n4(d \u2212 1)\n\u221a\n2\n2\u22124/d (d)\n2 (k)\n(\u2207u) \u2212 |F | .\n=\ng u\nR +u R +\nd\n2\nThe similarity to the string action with the dilaton is not coincidental, and is because one\ncan also obtain the dilaton by dimensional reduction.\n(k)\nVarying this with respect to gij , we get\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n4(d \u2212 1)\n(k)\n(k)\n2\n(k)\nu Rij \u2212 gij R\n\u2207i u\u2207j u\n(2.28)\n\u2212 \u2207i \u2207j u2 + gij \u22072 u2 = u2 Tij \u2212\n2\nd\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4(d \u2212 1)\n1\n2\n(d) 2\u22124/d\n(\u2207u) \u2212 R u\n\u2212 gij \u2212\n2\nd\n2\n\nSee for example equations (2.12) and (2.13) of [11].\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fwhich can be checked to be equivalent to Eq. (2.22) with the substitution Eq. (2.25). Here\n(k)\n(k)\nTij is defined to be the variation of the matter action with respect to gij .\nSince e2A = u4/d , the variation \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd which leads to Eq. (2.23), should be\nequivalent to varying with respect to u and multiplying by \u2212d/4, and it is.\nIf we now try to identify the effective potential by direct comparison of Eq. (2.1) and\nEq. (2.5), we find\n!\nZ\nX\n\u221a u2\n1\n2\n2(d \u2212 1)\n(d)\n\u2212R(k) +\n|F (p) |2 \u2212 Tstring \u2212\n(\u2207u)2\n(2.29)\ng\n2\n2 p\nd\nd\nwhich is close but not quite right, because the R(d) term is missing from the equations of\nmotion. However, we cannot simply add it back, as we are trying to define an effective\npotential which is purely a functional of the k-dimensional fields.\nRather, we implement the strategy described at the end of \u00a72.2. The equation 0 =\n\u03b4S/\u03b4u is a constraint equation, so we need to enforce it in the definition of Vef f , except for a\nzero mode part. The zero mode part is exactly the part sourced by the R(d) term, and thus\nwe can do this by replacing R(d) with an undetermined constant C. If the d-dimensional\nequations equate this to R(d) , we will get the correct k-dimensional equations of motion.\nOn the other hand, from the point of view of the d-dimensional equations Eq. (2.6), we\nare adding an extra term to Vef f . To reconcile the various equations, we need to subtract\nthe same term without the u dependence.\nWhile this may seem a bit ad hoc, there is another way to justify it. The term in\nEq. (2.27) which becomes the d-dimensional Einstein term is\nZ\n\u221a 2\u22124/d (d)\ngu\nR .\n(2.30)\nThus we identify the d-dimensional Newton's constant as\nZ\nZ\n1\n\u221a 2\u22124/d\n\u221a (d\u22122)A\nd\u22122\nge\n=\ngu\n,\n= MP lanck,d =\nGN\n\n(2.31)\n\nso we can interpret the constant C as a Lagrange multiplier which enforces this definition.\nThis leads to\n\"\n!\n#\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nZ\nX\n1\n2\n4(d\n\u2212\n1)\n1\n1\n1 \u221a\n\u221a 2\u22124/d\n(d)\n(k)\n2\n(p) 2\n2\ng u \u2212R +\ngu\n|F | \u2212 Tstring \u2212\n(\u2207u) + C\n\u2212\nVef f =\n2\n2 p\nd\nd\n2\nGN\n(2.32)\n\nWith this definition, the \u03b4Vef f /\u03b4u = 0 constraint becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd (k)\nd \u2212 2 1\u22124/d\n2\n(d)\nCu\n= \u22122(d \u2212 1)\u2207 u + T + R\nu,\n\u2212\n2\n2\n\n(2.33)\n\nGiven C, this is a sensible constraint, but we need to explain how to choose C, and how\nthis eventually implies Eq. (2.26). Before explaining this, let us look at how we would solve\nEq. (2.33).\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\f2.5 Solving the constraint\nTo begin, let us set C = 0, and instead add a term \u03bbu on the left hand side. We get a\nSchr\u00f6dinger-type equation on X,3\n\u03bbu = \u2212\u22072 u +\n\nd\nU * u.\n2(d \u2212 1)\n\n(2.34)\n\nwith a \"local potential\"\n\n1 (k) 1 (d)\nR + T .\n(2.35)\n2\nd\nAs is very familiar, such an equation has solutions ui for a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues\n\u03bbi , and the ui form a complete basis for functions on X.\nThis is the relevant equation for Minkowski space-time with R(d) = 0, so let us discuss\nthis case first. Since u > 0 by its definition Eq. (2.25), the only acceptable solution is the\nground state u0 . However, the eigenvalue \u03bb0 typically will not be zero. For this to be true,\nthe integral of the potential (against u) must be zero, which is the \"warp factor constraint\"\nof [6, 21]. For compactification with X Ricci flat and nonzero flux, one can only satisfy\n(d)\nthis by adding sources with Tstring > 0, such as orientifolds or certain \u03b1\u2032 corrections. The\nsame will be true if we try to realize Minkowski space-time using an X with negative total\nR \u221a (k)\nscalar curvature\ngR < 0.\nKeeping in mind our Schr\u00f6dinger equation intuition, we return to the actual constraint\nequation Eq. (2.33). Integrating over X, we derive the warp factor constraint,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\nd (k)\nd\u22122\n\u221a 1\u22124/d\n\u221a\n(d)\nC\n.\n(2.36)\ngu\n=\ngu T + R\n\u2212\n2\n2\nU\u2261\n\nWhile this is still a necessary condition, once we allow C 6= 0 it can always be solved, and\nrelates C to the scale of u.\nThis is not yet the constraint of the no-go theorems [11, 27], which (as we discuss in\n\u00a75.1) uses the k-dimensional Einstein equation to control the sign of the right-hand-side. If\none knows that the local potential Eq. (2.35) has a definite sign, clearly C (and ultimately\nR(d) ) must have the opposite sign. However, the local potential U need not have a definite\nsign, in which case one needs to know the warp factor u to find the sign of the integral in\nEq. (2.36). Even when it has a definite sign, we need this information to estimate C.\nRather fortuitously, for d = 4, the equation Eq. (2.33) is linear inhomogeneous, so\nwe can easily get more information. Given the normalized eigenfunctions ui , satisfying\nEq. (2.34) with eigenvalues \u03bbi and\nZ\n\u221a\ngui uj = \u03b4ij ,\n(2.37)\nwe can write the solution as\n1\n1 X\nui (y)\nu(y) = \u2212 C\n6\n\u03bbi\ni\n\n3\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\ng ui .\n\n(2.38)\n\nX\n\nThis equation (with T (d) = 0) appears in [28, 35], although not with the interpretation of u as a warp\nfactor. It is also the d \u2192 \u221e limit of Eq. (2.33), a relation used in the math literature. Also, on replacing d\nwith 2 \u2212 k, Eq. (2.33) with T (d) = 0 becomes the Yamabe equation [26].\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fIf there are any modes with \u03bbi = 0 (normally there will not be), they can be left out of the\nsum, and enter the solution with undetermined coefficients.\nTo summarize, although we cannot solve the constraint Eq. (2.26) before knowing the\nd = 4-dimensional curvature R(d) , we can solve it up to an overall coefficient. The equation\nEq. (2.33) obtained by varying Eq. (2.32) is equivalent to Eq. (2.26); we just need to relate\nthe coefficient C to R(d) .\nThe same idea can be applied in d 6= 4, and by rescaling u one can set C = 1 in\nEq. (2.33), restoring it with the relation u \u221d C d/4 . Of course, one would have to solve a\nnonlinear equation. At first sight, the cases d > 4 would appear similar to d = 4, as the\nnonlinearity is mild. On the other hand, for d = 3 the source term blows up as u \u2192 0,\nwhich looks significant; however we leave the analysis of this for subsequent work.\n2.6 Interpreting the constraint\nTo summarize the discussion so far, we seek a k-dimensional functional whose variation\nleads to the Einstein equations for maximally symmetric compactifications. By direct\nsubstitution of the ansatz, we obtain Eq. (2.27) which has this property, but it is not\npurely k-dimensional, since it depends on the d-dimensional curvature R(d) .\nUsually (this is a convention), the d-dimensional effective action is defined in Einstein\nframe, i.e. with fixed Newton's constant GN . But this is easy to obtain from Eq. (2.27),\nbecause R(d) and GN are conjugate variables. Thus the effective potential is the Legendre\ntransform of Eq. (2.27),\nVef f =\n\n1\n1\nR(d) \u2212 Sef f,R\n2GN\n2\n\n(2.39)\n\u03b4Vef f /\u03b4R(d) =0\n\nwith R(d) relabeled C, and the factor 12 introduced to agree with the conventions of\nEq. (2.5). This reproduces Eq.

Thus, we choose the coefficient C in order to satisfy this\ncondition.\nSubstituting the solution of the constraint Eq. (2.33) into the effective potential Vef f\ndefined in Eq. (2.32), and using the definition Eq. (2.40), we get\nVef f =\n\nd\u22122 C\n.\n2d GN\n\n(2.41)\n\nThus, if we use this effective potential in Eq. (2.5), and impose the Einstein equation\nfollowing from this action, we obtain Eq. (2.9) with C = R(d) , and have reproduced the\ndiscussion of \u00a72. We stress that we do not need to know R(d) to compute it, rather this is\ndone by solving Eq. (2.33), and then imposing Eq. (2.40). Nor does one need to impose the\nk-dimensional Einstein equations; it is defined for general metric and field configurations.\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fSubstituting Eq. (2.38) into Eq.

A general argument to this effect is as follows. Since\nthe effective potential is a scalar, whose integral makes a contribution to the d-dimensional\naction proportional to the space-time volume, the same factor of the d-dimensional spacetime volume element must appear in every term. Then, using the definition made in\nEq. (2.4), the dependence on the warp factor is the same as the dependence on this volume\nelement.\nFor example, the NS sector of the type II string actions in string frame leads to\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\nZ q\n4(d \u2212 1)\n1 (3) 2\n(d)\n2\n\u22122\u03a6\n2\n(k)\n2\n(k)\n(\u2207u)\ng e\nu \u2212R \u2212 4(\u2207\u03a6) + |H | \u2212 Tstring \u2212\nVef f =\n2\nd\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1\n\u221a \u22122\u03a6 2\u22124/d\n+C\n\u2212\nge\nu\n.\n(2.44)\nGN\nIn this form, it is not manifest that the dilaton contribution to the potential is bounded\nbelow. One could make this manifest either by going to Einstein frame in k dimensions, or\n(for IIa theory) going to an M theory description in k + 1 dimensions. Our later arguments\nthat the potential is bounded below will assume that this has been done.\nTwo cases in which the warp factor dependence may not be immediately obvious are\ncontributions from electric flux, and contributions from the Chern-Simons terms. The easy\nway to argue in the first case is to use duality to reexpress the action in terms of magnetic\nflux. Thus, a p-form electric flux behaves in expressions such as Eq. (2.17) like a D \u2212p-form\nmagnetic flux.\nA more direct argument to this effect uses the fact that a background electric flux\ncompatible with maximal space-time symmetry must have p \u2265 d, and transforms like the\nd-dimensional volume form multiplied by a p \u2212 d-form on X. Then, it is quantized in units\nof the d-dimensional volume form [7]. Taking into account the space-time metric in the\nterm |F (p) |2 , this term is independent\nof the warp factor, so again the entire dependence\np\ncomes from the volume form g (d) .\nAs for the Chern-Simons terms, these will only contribute to the effective potential in\nthe presence of a background electric field; for example in M theory we can have\nZ\nC (3) \u2227 G(4) \u2227 G(4)\n(2.45)\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fand a background G(4) = Gdx0 dx1 dx2 dx3 in d = 4. Again, the quantization condition on\nthe electric field will force the same warp factor dependence.\n\n3. Physical discussion\nLet us recap the final expression for the effective potential. We have eliminated all dependence on d-dimensional physics except the number d, which we now set to d = 4.\nThe metric, curvature, fluxes and warp factor u are all defined on X, as is the additional\n(d)\n\"stringy source\" Tstring .\n\"\n!\n#\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\nX\n1 \u221a\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u221a\n(d)\n2\n(p) 2\n2\nVef f =\ng u \u2212R +\ngu .\n|F | \u2212 Tstring \u2212 3(\u2207u) + C\n\u2212\n2\n2 p\n2\n2\nGN\n(3.1)\nTo use it, one enforces the warp factor constraint \u03b4Vef f /\u03b4u = 0, which in d = 4 is linear,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n1\n1 X (p) 2 1 (d)\n1\n2\n|F | + Tstring\n(3.2)\nU = R\u2212\n\u2212 C = \u2212\u2207 + U u;\n6\n3\n2\n4 p\n4\n\nthus determining C and u up to an overall normalization, and the warped volume constraint\nZ\n1\n\u221a\n=\ngu,\nGN\nthus determining the normalization. Due to the simple form of Eq. (3.1), its final value on\nsubstituting u is simply C/4GN , as in Eq. (2.41).\n3.1 Physical regimes\nWith the main result in hand, let us discuss some of its physics in d = 4. First, we consider\na constant warp factor,\n1\n,\n(3.3)\nu=\nGN VolX\nso Eq. (3.1) reduces to\nR\u221a\ngU\nVef f,unwarped = \u2212\n.\n(3.4)\n(GN VolX)2\nIn this case, the original intuition leading to Eq. (1.1) is correct. This will be exact if U is\nconstant.\nBefore we continue, there are two general conventions we could take for GN . When\ndiscussing fixing of moduli, such as VolX, we want to exhibit the dependence of different\nterms of the potential on the moduli, so we should choose a fixed GN in fundamental units.\nIn this case we have a universal 1/(VolX)2 (in d = 4) prefactor for the potential, as in [22].\nAs the simplest possible example, taking X = S k , with VolX = Lk , and turning on\nflux F (p) with p = k, we have\nZ\n1\n1 \u221a 2\ngu (\u2212R + ||F ||2 )\nVef f =\n(3.5)\n2\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\nF2\n1\nk\u22122\n(3.6)\n\u2212R\nL\n+\n=\n2Lk\n2G2N L2k\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fwhere R > 0 is the curvature of a diameter 1 sphere. This potential has a unique negative\nminimum. In this approximation, one recovers many of the effective potentials found in\nthe string compactification literature.\nOnce the volume is fixed, one is better off taking GN \u221d 1/VolX, in which case u \u223c 1.\nThis is the convention we will follow below.\nAs we now explain, there appear to be two general regimes, distinguished by whether\nthe warp factor is slowly varying or not. Since the new physics of the warp factor has to do\nwith its variation, the first might also be called \"weak warping,\" or some more euphonious\nversion of this.\n3.2 Slowly varying warp factor\nIf the variation of U is small, we can try to ignore the derivatives in Eq. (3.2), to find\nu=\u2212\n\nGN Vef f\nC\n=\u2212\n.\n4U\nU\n\n(3.7)\n\nOne necessary condition for this to make sense is that U must have a definite sign. Treating\nthe derivatives as a perturbation, and solving to first order, another condition for this\napproximation to be good is\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n\u22072\n<< 1.\n(3.8)\nU\nWhile these conditions can be satisfied, for example in AdS compactifications, they are\nquite restrictive. Localized sources like branes and orientifold planes will violate them.\nEven without these, if U varies on a scale L (in fundamental units), say set by the size of\nX, then we require\nLk+2 * |G2N Vef f | >> 1.\n(3.9)\nThus one requires large vacuum energy, large volume or both.\nIn this approximation, Vef f is always smaller in magnitude than Eq. (3.4). To see this,\nwe begin by substituting Eq. (3.7) into Eq. (3.1), to get an explicit expression for Vef f in\nterms of U ,\n1\n1\n=\u00b1\n,\n(3.10)\n2\nU L2\u22124/d\nGN Vef f\nwhere the sign is opposite to that of U , and we use the mathematical notation\nkf kL\u03b1 =\n\n\u0012Z\n\n\u221a\ng |f |\u03b1\n\n\u00131/\u03b1\n\n.\n\n(3.11)\n\nThen, we use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality\nkf k kgk \u2265 (f, g)2 ,\n\n(3.12)\n\napplied to f = U 1\u22122/d and g = U 2/d\u22121 .\nThus, in this regime warping increases the effective potential for AdS, and would\ndecrease it for dS.\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\f3.3 The ground state approximation\nWhen the condition Eq. (3.8) is not satisfied, we need to take the derivatives into account.\nLet us consider the idea that, to a good approximation, the warp factor will be proportional\nto the ground state wave function u0 . When it is, we can drop the other terms in Eq. (2.38),\nto find\nZ\n1\n\u221a\nu \u223c cu0 ;\n\u2261 GN\ngu0 ;\nC \u223c \u22126GN c2 \u03bb0\n(3.13)\nc\n\nand\n\n3\n(3.14)\nVef f = \u2212 c2 \u03bb0 .\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a\nHere u0 \u223c 1/ VolX (since it is normalized), so c \u223c VolX and u \u223c 1.\nOf course, a constant warp factor is the ground state for constant U , so there will some\nnearby regime in which this is a good approximation. Here are various arguments that this\nregime is large:\nR\u221a\ngui in Eq. (2.38), only i = 0 has a positive definite\n\u2022 Out of all the source terms\nintegrand. For the other eigenmodes, the integral will have cancellations, typically\nmaking it much smaller than 1/GN .\n\u2022 Since the other eigenfunctions always have nodes and are negative in some part of\nX, if they come in with significant coefficients, the solution is in danger of violating\nthe consistency condition that u > 0 at each point.\n\u2022 Normally, the 1/\u03bbi factor will be maximized for i = 0. This is clear if the spectrum\nis positive. If \u03bb0 < 0, there are good reasons (which we discuss below) to expect that\nthe other \u03bbi > 0, in which case all but a few will have \u03bbi >> |\u03bb0 |.\nIn \u00a73.5, we will further discuss the validity of this approximation. To oversimplify a\nbit, it will be good in the opposite regime from Eq. (3.9),\nLk+2 * |G2N Vef f | . 1.\nIn this approximation, warping significantly increases the effective potential:\nR\u221a\ngU\n3 2\n.\nVef f = \u2212 c \u03bb0 > Vef f,unwarped = \u2212\n2\n(GN VolX)2\nThis follows from the variational bound for the wave function u = constant,\nR\u221a\ngU\n,\n\u2212\u03bb0 \u2265 \u2212\nVolX\n\n(3.15)\n\n(3.16)\n\n(3.17)\n\nthe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality\nZ\n1\n\u221a\n2\n=\nG\n(\ngu0 )2 ) \u2264 G2N VolX,\nN\n2\nc\nand finally 3/2 > 1.\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n(3.18)\n\n\f3.4 Basic picture\nThe two approximations we discussed do not cover all the possibilities, and one might\nstudy others, or develop a mixed picture by using each in different regions and patching\nthem together. However the general picture is similar enough in both that we leave this\nfor subsequent work, and instead try to outline the physical picture.\nAs is familiar from quantum mechanics, the ground state wave function will have most\nof its support in potential wells. This is also true (although less so) for Eq. (3.7) with\nU > 0.\nHere, the local potential is minus the energy density T00 , so the warp factor will be\nconcentrated in regions of positive energy. Conversely, regions with negative energy will\nhave this energy warped (or redshifted) away.\nMost sources, such as fluxes, make positive contributions to the energy density. This\nalso includes negative curvature. On the other hand, positive curvature, and some stringy\nsources like orientifolds, make negative contributions to the energy density.\nPhysically, the warp factor relates energy scales on X to those in space-time. In the\nlanguage of AdS/CFT (see for example [36]), one says that u is large in the \"UV\" and small\nin the \"IR.\" The usual AdS solutions are supported by X with positive curvature. This\ncontributes a negative energy density which outweighs the flux energy, and sends u \u2192 0,\nconsistent with the picture we just gave. Conversely, the parts of X with positive energy\ndensity, either from flux or from negative curvature, are the UV.\nThus, the basic physics is that, while the vacuum energy density is a sum of effects\nfrom different regions of the manifold, each given by minus the local potential U , we must\ntake into account the local warp factor in adding energy densities, which we do with the\nweighing u2 * U . This favors the UV region, with positive energy, and thus raises Vef f .\nThis gives us a physical answer to the puzzle raised in the introduction, that varying\nthe conformal factor might send the effective potential to arbitrarily negative values. Such\nvariations produce positive scalar curvature, so decrease the warp factor, and redshift away\nthe negative energy. In \u00a74 we will try to demonstrate this from the equations.\nIn an actual vacuum, the local potential U is determined by the k-dimensional Einstein\nequation in a way we will discuss below. If one can find solutions in which it is negative\nin some regions and positive in others, since the warp factor weighs the negative regions\nmore heavily, taking it into account should make it easier to find de Sitter solutions. On\nthe other hand, the no-go theorems show that negative U is not so easy to obtain.\n3.5 Going through \u039b = 0\nWhat happens if one varies parameters in k dimensions (say pseudo-moduli or fluxes), so\nthat Vef f crosses zero? While in conventional field theory, there is nothing special about\nzero energy, in gravity there definitely is. Can we see any sign of this in k dimensions?\nAs we recalled in the introduction, the constructions of de Sitter vacua using the effective potential, implicitly or explicitly rely on precisely such a continuation of parameters.\nFor example, one style of argument [25] is to combine sources of vacuum energy which\nare computable in a supersymmetric AdS vacuum, with a single additional supersymmetry\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fbreaking energy which \"uplifts\" the vacuum to dS. This might be justified by continuing\nthe parameters from a better controlled nonsupersymmetric AdS vacuum, or conversely\nsome flaw in the reasoning might appear at this step. Thus, it is crucial to understand this\npoint.\nAt first sight, the series solution Eq. (2.38) for the warp factor looks singular as an\neigenvalue \u03bb passes through zero. We can get a simple model for this by considering the\nfamily of local potentials obtained by a simple shift a of the energy,\nUa \u2261 U + a.\n\n(3.19)\n\nIn massive IIa theory, the (F (0) )2 source has precisely this effect (with a < 0).\nClearly the eigenfunctions ui are independent of a, while the eigenvalues simply become\n\u03bbi + a. Thus the series solution becomes\nZ\nCX\n1\n\u221a\ngui .\nu(y) = \u2212\nui (y)\n(3.20)\n6\n\u03bbi + a\ni\n\nAs we approach the resonance, it should be a good approximation to keep only the resonant\nterm in the sum. Now, there are two cases:\n\u2022 An excited state, i.e. i > 0, passes through zero, \u03bbi + a \u223c 0. Assuming that the\nR\u221a\ngui 6= 0, which (in the absence of some special consideration such\nmatrix element\nas symmetry) will almost surely be true, we will have u \u223c ui near the resonance.\nBut since the excited state wave functions ui all have nodes, this is inconsistent with\npositivity of u. Before we reach this point, we will find u = 0 somewhere on X, so\nour assumptions must break down.\n\u2022 On the other hand, if the ground state energy passes through zero, we are simply\ndoing the same truncation to the ground state that we discussed in \u00a73.3. All of the\napproximate results given there, such as Eq. (3.13) and Eq. (3.14), have sensible\ncontinuations through \u03bb0 = 0.\nThus, we see no obstacle to continuing Vef f through zero to a de Sitter vacuum with\n\u03bb0 < 0, up to the point where \u03bb1 crosses zero. Somewhere before that point, at a vacuum\nenergy\n(3.21)\n\u039b \u223c MP4 lanck,4 (\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb0 ),\nthere will be some sort of transition. It is not clear whether this can be described using\nsupergravity. If it can, perhaps the factorized form Eq. (2.4) of the metric breaks down.\nIf not, then assuming u is analytic (as will be true for U analytic) and vanishes at a point\ny0 , the metric near this point will look like (in d = 4)\nds2 = \u03b1|y \u2212 y0 |\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + dy 2 + . . . ,\n\n(3.22)\n\nin other words an event horizon. The precise meaning of this depends on the metric on X,\nand since the k-dimensional Einstein equation has source terms which blow up as u \u2192 0,\nwe need to look at details of the example to work this out.\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\fOne could get good estimates for this gap using general results on Schr\u00f6dinger operators. For example, if the wavefunction is localized to a potential well U \u223c m2 x2 /2, there\nwill be excited states with \u2206\u03bb \u223c m. Again, the best way to do this probably depends on\ndetails of the example at hand.\nA simplified picture is to grant that\n\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb0 \u223c L\u22122 ,\n\n(3.23)\n\nwhich leads to the bound Eq. (3.15).\n3.6 Cosmological application\nIn subsequent work we will try to develop a picture of early cosmological dynamics based\non these results. The basic idea is that the equations of motion for slow roll inflation,\n3H\n\n\u2202Vef f\n\u2202\u03c6a\n= \u2212Gab\n,\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c6b\n\n(3.24)\n\ncan be computed using Eq. (3.1), to get a flow on the space of metrics and other fields\non X similar to Ricci flow. This is somewhat like Perelman's treatment of Ricci flow as a\ngradient flow [28].\nAs is manifest from its definition, the effective potential Vef f decreases under the flow;\nthus one expects that the local potential U becomes more positive, and the eigenvalues \u03bbi\neach increase, in a way we can roughly model by taking Eq. (3.19) with a \u223c t. In this\nsituation the consistency condition we just discussed might be a significant constraint on\nthe compactifications which lead to a sensible cosmology.\n\n4. Stability\nAs we saw in \u00a73, we expect the problem raised in the introduction, that the effective\npotential is unbounded below under varying the conformal factor, to be solved by the warp\nfactor. Such variations produce positive scalar curvature, so decrease the warp factor, and\nredshift away the negative energy.\nIn this section we look at how one might show this from the equations. In fact, at this\npoint we have a precise mathematical\nConjecture 1 Consider a conformal class of metrics g\u0303 = e2B g on a k-dimensional manifold X; then the functional Eq. (3.1) evaluated at its critical point \u03b4V /\u03b4u = 0, considered\nas a function on the space of all conformal factors B with fixed warped volume and volume\nZ p\nZ p\ng\u0303u2\u22124/d = C1 ;\ng\u0303 = C2 ;\n(4.1)\nand all F , is bounded below.\n\nTo be precise, the volumes C1 and C2 should be defined in the k-dimensional Einstein\nframe.4\nR\u221a\nBy \"Einstein frame,\" one means conventions in which Vef f \u223c \u2212\ngR without any field-dependent\nprefactor, of the type which appears (for example) in Eq. (2.44). Such a prefactor can be removed by a\nfield-dependent conformal transformation.\n4\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fAlthough this is not the same claim as the positive energy theorem (there are AdS\nvacua), clearly it is related, and perhaps it can proven using some variation of the arguments\nused there [31, 38]. Here we make some nonrigorous but suggestive arguments.\n4.1 Linearized stability\nThis was already checked for various explicit solutions in the early Kaluza-Klein literature.\nLet us check it at short distances, for which one can simply take a flat background metric.\nThus, we allow a general conformal factor B as in Eq. (2.21), turning Eq. (2.27) into\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u221a\nVef f =\n\u2212 gedA+(k\u22122)B R(k) \u2212 2(k \u2212 1)\u22072 B \u2212 (k \u2212 2)(k \u2212 1)(\u2207B)2 + d(d \u2212 1)(\u2207A)2\nZ\n\u0011\n\u221a dA+(k\u22122)B \u0010 (k)\n=\u2212\nR + 2d(k \u2212 1)\u2207A\u2207B + (k \u2212 2)(k \u2212 1)(\u2207B)2 + d(d \u2212 1)(\u2207A)2\nge\n\n(4.2)\n\nWhile every term individually is negative definite, the determinant of the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix of\nkinetic terms is\ndet = (k \u2212 1)(k \u2212 2)d(d \u2212 1) \u2212 d2 (k \u2212 1)2 = \u2212d(k \u2212 1)(D \u2212 2) < 0\n\n(4.3)\n\nso it has signature (+1, \u22121). As we expect, the conformal factor is the only mode with a\nwrong sign kinetic term. Solving the constraint and substituting back in, can in principle\nproduce a positive definite effective potential. We check that this is true at the linearized\nlevel for short wavelength fluctuations of B; the linearization of Eq.

One can then show that the overall exponent da + (k \u2212 2)b\nis negative for all k > 2.\nWhile the computation looks similar to the linearized analysis, it is not the same\nbecause it takes into account the exponentials in the integrand, and is thus nonlinear.\n4.3 Radially symmetric ansatz\nAnother nonlinear test at short distances can be done by considering a radially symmetric\nconformal factor, say\ne2B = (a2 + r 2 )\u03b3 ,\n(4.10)\nFor \u22122 < \u03b3 < \u22121, the conformal factor becomes large at r \u223c a, producing a region of large\nvolume and large positive curvature. On the other hand, it becomes small for r >> a,\nso one can patch such a region (or \"bubble\") into a general manifold X. This type of\nconstruction is used in the study of the Yamabe problem [26].\nWhile we omit the details here, one can show that the effective potential Eq. (3.1)\nremains bounded below in these metrics as well.\nTo summarize this section, a variety of simple modifications to the conformal factor have the\nfull nonlinear energy bounded below. Since this would seem to be necessary for string/M\ntheory compactification on X to be well defined, we conjecture that it is always true.\nFrom a physics point of view, it would be even more interesting if this worked for some\nX and failed for others, as this could give us a consistency condition and cut down on the\nplethora of vacua. The only evidence for this we see so far is that the case d = 3 might be\nspecial, since the source in Eq. (2.33) has a negative power of u in this case.\nWhile one might go on to conjecture that V is bounded below for all metrics on a given\nmanifold X, there are some mathematical reasons to doubt this [2]. Physically it is not\nrequired, as long as V has local minima, for which the tunnelling rates to lower minima\nare very small (as in [25]).\nWhen V is bounded below, the bound can be regarded as a topological invariant of X,\ndirectly analogous to the Yamabe invariant [26]. Of course, it might be the same invariant,\nas turned out to be the case for Perelman's entropy [2].\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\f5. Solutions\nSo far, we avoided using the k-dimensional Einstein equation Eq. (2.28), so that we could\nderive an effective potential which is valid off-shell. In this section we generally assume we\nare expanding around a solution.\n5.1 Solving the k-dimensional equations\nWe now bring in the Einstein equation, reinterpreted as above:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n4(d \u2212 1)\n(k)\n(k)\n2\n(k)\nu Rij \u2212 gij R\n\u2207i u\u2207j u\n(5.1)\n\u2212 \u2207i \u2207j u2 + gij \u22072 u2 = u2 Tij \u2212\n2\nd\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n4(d \u2212 1)\n\u2212 gij \u2212\n(\u2207u)2 \u2212 Cu2\u22124/d\n2\nd\n(d)\n\nNote that Tstring does not appear in this formula, however since normally it depends on\n(k)\n\nthe metric on X, terms from it will appear in Tij .\nIts trace is\n2(D \u2212 2) \u22121\nk\nk \u2212 2 (k)\nR = 2(k \u2212 1)u\u22121 \u22072 u +\n(u \u2207u)2 \u2212 u\u22124/d C \u2212 T (k) .\n2\nd\n2\n\n(5.2)\n\nFinally, the flux equations of motion are\nd \u2217 (u2 F ) = dF = 0.\n\n(5.3)\n\nIt might seem tempting to eliminate C using the constraint Eq. (2.23), to get an\nequation in terms of k-dimensional quantities, equivalent to Eq. (2.13). However this is\nnot a good idea, because we would lose the knowledge that C is constant on X.\nRather, we can use Eq. (2.23) to eliminate either R(k) or \u2212\u22072 u. If we do the first, we\nget\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(5.4)\n\u2212 (D \u2212 2)\u22072 u2 + dT (k) \u2212 (k \u2212 2)T (d) u2 = (D \u2212 2)Cu2\u22124/d .\nIntegrating this equation over the manifold gives\nZ\n\u0011\n\u221a \u0010 (k)\ng dT \u2212 (k \u2212 2)T (d) u2 ,\n(D \u2212 2)C = \u2212GN\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhich is the constraint appearing in the no-go theorems of [11, 27]. Writing it in terms of\nu2 , it becomes a Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a nonlinear source.\nIf we do the other elimination, we get\nR(k) = \u2212\n\n4(d \u2212 1) \u22121\n2(d \u2212 1) (k) 2(k \u2212 1) (d)\n(u \u2207u)2 + u\u22124/d C +\nT \u2212\nT .\nd\nD\u22122\nD\u22122\n\n(5.6)\n\nBoth are interesting equations. The combinations of flux stress-tensors which appear\nare\n\u03b1T (k) + \u03b2T (d) =\n\n1X\n((2p \u2212 k)\u03b1 \u2212 d\u03b2)|F (p) |2 .\n2 p\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n(5.7)\n\n\fIn the original trace equation Eq. (5.2), we have\nk\n1X\n\u2212T (k) \u2212 T (d) =\n(\u22124p + k(d + 2))|F (p) |2 ,\n2\n4 p\nwhich for k > 4 is always positive. For Eq. (5.4), we have\nX\ndT (k) \u2212 (k \u2212 2)T (d) = d\n(p \u2212 1)|F (p) |2 .\n\n(5.8)\n\n(5.9)\n\np\n\nAs in the no-go theorems, this is non-negative except for p = 0. Finally, in Eq. (5.6) we\nhave\nX\n2(d \u2212 1)T (k) \u2212 2(k \u2212 1)T (d) =\n((d \u2212 1)2p + k \u2212 d)|F (p) |2\n(5.10)\np\n\nAgain, for k > d this is always positive.\nTo summarize, Eq. (5.2) and Eq. (5.6) make the point that flux favors positive scalar\ncurvature on X, while stringy corrections are needed to get negative scalar curvature. We\ncan now go on to consider how the curvature is distributed in the internal dimensions, how\nthis impacts the warp factor, and whether the consistency condition \u03bb1 > 0 of the previous\nsection is significant or not. We will look at this in examples in future work.\n5.2 Conformal factor\nNext, we introduce the conformal factor. Fixing all the other fields, we would like to find\nthe conformal factor which minimizes Vef f . Granting that this is bounded below, there\nshould be a minimum satisfying \u03b4Vef f /\u03b4B = 0 (of course, there could be other critical\npoints). We need to fix the volume modulus to have a minimum; rather than do this\nR \u221a 2k/(k\u22122)\ngv\nwith a Lagrange multiplier D.\nphysically we simply impose Vol(X) =\n(k\u22122)B/2\nTaking v = e\n, and F = 0, we can rewrite Eq. (3.1) as\n\u0014\nZ q\n1\n4(k \u2212 1)\n4(d \u2212 1) 2\nVef f =\ng(k) \u2212 u2 v 2 R \u2212\n(\u2207v)\u2207(u2 v) \u2212\nv (\u2207u)2\n(5.11)\n2\nk\u22122\nd\n\u0015\nu2 X 2(k\u22122p)/(k\u22122) (p) 2\nv\n|F |\n(5.12)\n+\n2 p\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nZ\n1\n\u221a 2+4/(k\u22122) 2\u22124/d\n\u221a 2+4/(k\u22122)\ngv\ngv\n+C\n\u2212\nu\n+ D Vol(X) \u2212\n.(5.13)\nGN\nThe various p-form flux energies come with different powers of the conformal factor v, given\nby the L scaling of \u00a73, while Chern-Simons terms do not depend on the conformal factor.\nWe will not quote these in the equations below, but they can be easily added.\nWe expect that Vef f is minimized at the simultaneous critical point\n\u03b4Vef f\n4(k \u2212 1)\n4(d \u2212 1)\nd \u2212 2 2+4/(k\u22122) 1\u22124/d\n= \u2212uv 2 R +\nuv \u22072 v +\n\u2207(v 2 \u2207u) \u2212\nCv\nu\n\u03b4u\nk\u22122\nd\nd\n\u03b4Vef f\n2(k \u2212 1) 2 2\n2(k \u2212 1)\n0=\n= \u2212u2 vR +\n\u2207 (u v) +\n\u2207(u2 \u2207v)\n\u03b4v\nk\u22122\nk\u22122\n\u0010\n\u0011\n4(d \u2212 1)\nk\n\u2212\nv(\u2207u)2 \u2212\nv 1+4/(k\u22122) Cu2\u22124/d + D .\nd\nk\u22122\n0=\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\fWe can simplify the u constraint a bit by the change of variables u = w/v, to get\n\u0012\n\u0013\n4(d \u2212 1) 4(k \u2212 1)\nd \u2212 2 2+4/(k\u22122)\n4(d \u2212 1) 2\n\u2212\nv\u2207 w \u2212\nCv\n(w/v)1\u22124/d\n(5.14)\n0 = \u2212wvR \u2212\nw \u22072 v +\nd\nk\u22122\nd\nd\n\u0010\n\u0011\n4(d \u2212 1)\nk\n2(k \u2212 1)\nv\u2207v \u22121 \u2207(w2 ) \u2212\n(\u2207w \u2212 w\u2207 log v)2 \u2212\nv 2+4/(k\u22122) C(w/v)2\u22124/d + D .\n0 = \u2212w2 R +\nk\u22122\nd\nk\u22122\nExcept for the source term, the constraint is now linear in v and w separately.\n5.3 Comparison with supersymmetric ansatzes\nAny supersymmetric ansatz should be using the conformal factor which minimizes the\npotential, so let us sketch how this works in two well-studied examples.\nIn [6], K. and M. Becker constructed M theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau fourfolds, thus d = 3 and k = 8. They take B = \u2212A/2 (see their Eqs. (2.11) and (2.30)), so\nv = u\u22121 . Their construction involves both electric and magnetic four-form flux, so in the\nmagnetic notation uses p = 4 and p = 7. Stringy ingredients include the Chern-Simons\nterm, and an R4 anomaly term.\nIn [21], Giddings, Kachru and Polchinski developed supersymmetric type IIb compactification on Calabi-Yau threefolds with flux. Here d = 4 and k = 6. We will consider the\nspecial case in which the dilaton is constant. They take B = \u2212A, so again v = u\u22121 . This\nconstruction uses p = 3 and p = 5 flux, a Chern-Simons term F \u2227 H \u2227 C (4) , and orientifold\n(d)\nsources to Tstring .\nThe two constructions are similar enough that we can make a unified discussion. Both\nare based on Calabi-Yau manifolds, so R = 0. Both lead to Minkowski space-time, so we\ncan set C = 0. We note in passing that the ground state approximation of \u00a73.3 is always\nexact in this case.\nBoth constructions use conformally invariant flux with 2p = k (call this Fa ), and an\nadditional p > k/2 magnetic flux (call this Fb ) which is determined by the warp factor,\nFb = \u2217(D) \u01eb(d) \u2227 d(u2 ), where \u2217(D) is the D-dimensional Hodge star in the warped metric.5\nSubstituting the ansatz, in both this becomes Fb = \u2217(k) d(v 2 ).\nIn both cases, the function w of Eq. (5.14) is set to a constant (say 1), so this equation\nbecomes linear. For Minkowski space-time, C = 0 and one has an integral constraint\non T (d) , which in some sense is a supersymmetric partner to a topological constraint on\n(d)\nFa2 \u2212 Tstring (the M2 or D3 tadpole condition).\nLet us derive the equations of motion by re-expressing the effective potential Eq. (5.11)\nin terms of v and w,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ q\n1\n4(k \u2212 1)\n4(d \u2212 1) 2\nw2 2\n2\n2\n\u22122 2\n(k)\nVef f =\ng\n\u2212\n(\u2207v)\u2207(w /v) \u2212\nv (\u2207(w/v)) + 2 (Fa + v Fb )\n2\nk\u22122\nd\n2v\n(5.15)\nw 2 (d)\n2 and has the same\nT\n,\nbut\nsince\nthis\nalways\ncomes\nwith\nF\nThere is also a term 2v\n2 string\na\ndependence on v and w, we leave it out until the end.\n5\n\nThis follows from the cancellation between warped tension and potential energy for supersymmetric\nspace-time filling M2 or D3 branes.\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n\fAfter varying Vef f , we set w = 1, to find\n\u03b4Vef f\n1\n1\n= \u03b1 \u22072 v + 2 (Fa2 + v \u22122 Fb2 )\n(5.16)\n\u03b4w\nv\n2v\n\u03b4Vef f\n1\n0=\n= \u2212\u03b1(v \u22121 \u22072 v \u2212 v \u22122 (\u2207v)2 ) \u2212 2 (Fa2 + 2v \u22122 Fb2 )\n(5.17)\n\u03b4v\n2v\nwhere\n\u0012\n\u0013\n4(k \u2212 1) 4(d \u2212 1)\n\u2212\n\u03b1\u2261\n> 0.\nk\u22122\nd\nSubtracting these equations, we find\n1\n\u03b1(\u2207v)2 = 2 Fb2 ,\n(5.18)\n2v\np\n(d)\nwhich is satisfied by Fb = \u03b1/2\u2207v 2 . Substituting in Eq. (5.16), and restoring Tstring , we\nfind\n(d)\n\u2212\u03b1\u22072 v 2 = Fa2 \u2212 Tstring ,\n0=\n\nwhich is the warp factor equation in both cases.\nTwo points worth observing are the supersymmetry relation between the warp factor\nand Fb , and how the positive curvature required by Eq. (5.2) is provided by the variation\nof the conformal factor v.\nIt would be very interesting to find a derivation of the effective superpotential along\nthe lines of \u00a72, starting with the D-dimensional supergravity Lagrangian and an unbroken\nsupersymmetry, and producing a functional of the k-dimensional fields.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work grew out of ongoing discussions with Renata Kallosh on compactification\nusing negatively curved manifolds, to whom we give special thanks.

Conventions\nSupergravity considerations will be accurate when all geometric length scales, such as the\ndiameter and volume of X and curvature lengths, are greater than 1 in fundamental units\n(we ignore the string coupling), so we take MP lanck,D = 1 to make this condition evident.\nWe furthermore take the coordinates on X to range over order 1, so a geometric length scale\n\u221a\nL goes as L2 \u223c gij . Then VolX \u223c g \u223c Lk , derivatives \u2207 \u223c 1, and the scalar curvature\nR \u223c 1/L2 .
