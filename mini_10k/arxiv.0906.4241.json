The MC results in readjusting the interior viscous torque, and its effects\nare operative not only in but also beyond the MC region. The BP process is invoked to transfer the \"excessive\" angular momentum from an accretion disc.

It turns out that the BP efficiency of extracting angular momentum and the intensity of the outflow are required to be greater than some critical values.\naccretion: accretion discs, black hole physics, magnetic field, angular momentum transfer\n\nDisc accretion is widely regarded as an effective energy\nmechanism of high-energy phenomena in AGNs, X-ray\nbinaries and some other compact objects. The interior viscous torque due to differential rotation transfers angular\nmomentum outward to make accreting matter fall inward,\nand energy of disc radiation arises from dissipation of\ngravitational binding energy [1-4].\nRotating energy of a fast spinning black hole is another\nenergy source for disc radiation. A black hole can exert a\nsignificant torque at its surrounding disc via large-scale\nmagnetic field, and this mechanism is referred to as the\nmagnetic connection (MC) process. The Poynting flux is\ninjected into the inner disc in the MC process, resulting in\nthe enhanced dissipation more concentrated in the inner\ndisc [5, 6]. This feature can be used to interpret the very\nsteep emissivity index of MCG-6-30-15 required by the\nobserved Fe K\u03b1 line [7-10].\nOn the other hand, large-scale magnetic fields also play\nan important role in jet production, e.g. via BlandfordPayne (BP) process [11-14]. Recently, Miller et al. pointed\nout that the X-ray-absorbing wind discovered in the observation of GRO J1655-40 must be powered by a magnetic\nprocess, by which angular momentum can also be transferred efficiently out of the disc [15].\nIt is well known that angular momentum transfer is of\nfundamental importance in disc accretion. A potential barrier arising from continuous transfer of \"excessive\" angular\nmomentum outward by the interior viscous torque blocks\naccretion at outer disc, and this problem is referred to as a\npuzzle of overall equilibrium of angular momentum of accretion discs. The following processes could be invoked to\nremove the \"excessive\" angular momentum from the disc:\n(1) Tidal interaction. It has been argued that the tidal\n\ninteraction with the companion star can exert a decelerating\ntorque on the outer boundary, and transfer the excessive\nangular momentum of accretion disc to the bulk revolution\nof a binary system [16].\n(2) Radiation. Angular momentum can be taken away\nfrom the disc by radiation. However, the efficiency is very\nlow as argued in the next section of this paper. Probably,\nangular momentum can be carried away by gravitational\nwave in a very violent burst.\n(3) Exterior stresses. Disc could be coupled to enwrapped corona, and the excessive angular momentum is\ntransferred out of the disc by the stress exerted on the interface [17, 18]. However, the interface between the disc\nand corona is rather blurry, and the contribution due to the\nstress remains unclear.\n(4) Outflow. Outflow can be launched from the accretion disc to carry away the excessive angular momentum. It\nis noted that the initial specific angular momentum of outflow matter is no greater than that of the accreting matter\non the disc. Outflow can contribute to the overall equilibrium, provided that there exists some interaction between\nthe outflow and the disc [19].\n(5) Large-scale magnetic field. Analogous to the MC\nprocess, angular momentum can be taken away very efficiently by virtue of some \"open\" magnetic field lines anchored in the accretion disc in either Poynting or hydromagnetic fluxes, e.g., the BP process [11, 20-22].\nIn this paper, we will discuss the transportation and redistribution of energy in the MC process and the critical BP\nReceived; accepted\ndoi:\n\u2020\nCorresponding author (email: dxwang@mail.hust.edu.cn )\nSupported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant\n10873005, the Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education under\ngrant 200804870050 and National Basic Research Program of China under grant\n2009CB824800.\n\nSci China Ser G-Phys Mech Astron | Jan. 2009 | vol. 52 | no. 1 | 1-?\n\n\fefficiency for the overall equilibrium of angular momentum.\nThroughout this paper the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates and\nthe geometric units G = c = 1 are used.\n1. Transportation and redistribution of energy in MC\nprocess\nThere are two kinds of large-scale magnetic field as shown\nin Figure 1. The MC process is invoked to transfer energy\nand angular momentum from a fast-spinning black hole to\nthe inner region of accretion disc (henceforth, the MC region) via the closed field lines. The BP process is invoked\nto drive outflow centrifugally in the outer region of the disc\n(henceforth, the BP region). The boundary between the two\nregions is identified by rtr , which can be determined by,\ne.g., the screw instability of magnetic field in the MC\nprocess [23].\n\nFigure 1 Magnetic field configuration for the MC and BP\nprocesses.\nThe conservation equations of energy and angular momentum governing the disc accretion with the MC process\nare given as follows [5],\nd \u027a \u2020\n( M D L \u2212 g ) = 4\u03c0 r ( FL\u2020 \u2212 H MC ) ,\n(1)\ndr\n\nd \u027a \u2020\n( M D E \u2212 g \u22c5 \u03a9 D ) = 4\u03c0 r ( FE \u2020 \u2212 H MC \u03a9 D ) ,\ndr\n\nFigure 2.\n\n(2)\n\nwhere r is the disc radius, \u03a9 D is the angular velocity of\nthe disc, and M\u027a is the accretion rate. The quantities E \u2020\nD\n\nand L\u2020 are the specific energy and specific angular momentum of the accreting matter, respectively [24]. The\nquantities F and g are respectively the radiation flux\nand interior viscous torque of the disc. The radiation flux\nconsists of FDA and FMC , which are the contribution due\nto disc accretion and MC process, respectively. The quantity H MC is the flux of angular momentum transferred\nfrom the black hole to the inner disc in the MC process,\nbeing related to the MC torque TMC as follows,\n\ndTMC = 4\u03c0 rdr \u22c5 H MC ,\n(3)\nand the Poynting flux injected into the disc can be written\nas\n| E \u00d7 BD |\nS Poynting = D\n= H MC \u03a9 D ,\n(4)\n4\u03c0\ni.e., the MC power transferred to unit disc area is exactly\nequal to the Poynting flux from the black hole to the accretion disc in the MC process, i.e., pMC = H MC \u22c5 \u03a9 D [10]. It\nis the magnetic torque that bends the field lines and induces\na toroidal magnetic field, and subsequently produces the\nPoynting flux.\nContrastively, the accretion power arising from gravitational binding energy is expressed by the first term at LHS\nof eqn.(2), and we define the rate of releasing gravitational\nbinding energy in unit disc area as\nd ( M\u027a D E \u2020 )\npDA \u2261\n.\n(5)\n4\u03c0 r \u22c5 dr\nIn this paper, we estimate the magnetic field on the black\nhole horizon by balancing the magnetic pressure and the\nram pressure of accretion, and assume that the field on the\ndisc varies with the disc radius in a power-law of index n\n[10, 25]. The above equations are reduced to those for a\nstandard thin disc by taking H MC = 0 .\n\nComparison of different contribution to the radiation: (a) the accretion power pDA (dashed line) versus\n\nthe locally dissipated energy flux FDA \u22c5 E \u2020 (solid line), (b) the MC power pMC (dashed line) versus the locally dissipated energy flux FMC \u22c5 E \u2020 (solid line), and (c) the total power pDA + pMC (dashed line) versus the total locally dissipated energy flux F \u22c5 E \u2020 (solid line) with black-hole spin a* = 0.5 and n = 6 .\n2\n\nGAN ZhaoMing et al. Sci China Ser G-Phys Mech Astron | Jan. 2009 | vol. 52 | no. 1 | ?-?\n\n\fInspecting eqn.(1) and (2), we find that the MC effect on\nthe disc radiation is validated by readjusting the interior\nviscous torque. Moreover, as shown in Figure 2 the total\nreleased energy at a disc radius, including energy released\nfrom gravitational binding energy and that transferred in\nthe MC process, cannot be dissipated locally because of the\nconductive effect of the interior viscous torque notated by\nthe second term at LHS of eqn.(2). Therefore a part of the\nreleased energy is transferred from the inner disc to the\nouter disc, and the MC effect works not only in the MC\nregion but also in the BP region.\nIt should be emphasized that the viscous torque only\ntransfers the angular momentum outward within the disc,\nand it has no contribution to the overall equilibrium. The\ndisc radiation is very ineffective in transferring angular\nmomentum, and it takes away only a very small fraction of\nthe total \"excessive\" angular momentum as shown in Figure 3.\n\nIn our model energy is extracted from disc in the form of\nPoynting flux because of the magnetic interaction, and the\nlatter is converted into the kinetic energy of the matter\nflowing along the field lines. As shown in ref.[11], the specific energy e and the specific angular momentum l of\nthe outflow along a field line remain constant, where\n\nl = rjet\u03c5\u03c6 \u2212 rjet B\u03c6 k .\n\nThe quantities at RHS of eqn.(7) have the same meanings as given in ref.[11], and l is related to the specific\nangular momentum of accreting matter as follows,\nl = \u03bb L\u2020 ,\n(8)\nwhere the parameter \u03bb represents the efficiency of extracting angular momentum from the disc. Based on the\nconservation of angular momentum we have the following\nrelation in the BP region,\ndM\u027a D\nd \u027a \u2020\n( M D L \u2212 g ) = 4\u03c0 rFL\u2020 + l \u22c5\n.\n(9)\ndr\ndr\nEqn.(6) implies that some mechanisms are required to\nremove angular momentum away from the disc. In addition,\nthe efficiency of the mechanism should be high enough to\nmake the viscous torque decrease with the disc radius, attaining a small value eventually at the outer boundary of\nthe disc. To get the critical BP efficiency for the overall\nequilibrium of angular momentum, we set\n\ndg dr < 0 .\n\nFigure 3 Fraction of total \"excessive\" angular momentum taken away by radiation with and without MC effects\nin solid and dotted lines, respectively. The parameter a*\nand n are the same as in Figure 2.\nThus tremendous angular momentum is accumulated\npersistently at the outer disc, i.e.,\ndg\n> 0 and g (r \u2192 \u221e ) \u2192 \u221e ,\n(6)\ndr\nHow to carry the excessive angular momentum out of\naccretion disc to guarantee a steady disc accretion? It is an\nopen question to a consistent theory of accretion disc [18].\n2. Critical BP efficiency for overall equilibrium of angular momentum\nSince the excessive angular momentum cannot be taken\naway efficiently via radiation, outflow is invoked to transfer angular momentum from the disc. It turns out that the\npuzzle of overall equilibrium of angular momentum can be\nresolved, provided that the efficiency of extracting angular\nmomentum via the BP process and the outflow rate are\ngreater than some critical values.\n\n(7)\n\n(10)\n\nIncorporating eqns.(8)-(10), and neglecting the contribution of disc radiation to the angular momentum transfer, we\nhave\nd ln M\u027a D\nd ln L\u2020\n< (\u03bb \u2212 1)\n(11)\ndr\ndr\nSince the BP region is far from the hole ( rtr > rin > rH ),\nwe take Newtonian expression for the specific angular\nmomentum, i.e., L\u2020 \u2248 GMr . Considering the existence of\nthe outflow, we assume the accretion rate varying with the\ndisc radius as follows,\nd ln M\u027a D s\n= ,\nr > rtr ,\n(12)\ndr\nr\nwhere the parameter s (0 < s < 1) represents the intensity\nof outflow. Incorporating eqns.(11) and (12), we have\n\n2 s (\u03bb \u2212 1) > 1 .\n\n(13)\n\nEqn.(13) implies that the viscous torque could decrease\nwith the disc radius, provided that the efficiency of extracting angular momentum by the BP process (represented\nby \u03bb ) and the intensity of the outflow (represented by s )\nare high enough. This is a critical condition for the overall\nequilibrium of angular momentum in accretion discs.\n\nGAN ZhaoMing et al.

Conclusion and discussion\nIn this paper, we discuss the MC and BP effects on\ntransportation and redistribution of energy and angular\nmomentum in accretion discs. It turns out that the MC effect readjusts the interior viscous torque, which is valid not\nonly in the MC region but also in the beyond BP region.\nWe argue that the BP process is of essential importance for\nthe overall equilibrium of angular momentum in accretion\ndiscs, and a criterion is derived in terms of the BP efficiency of extracting angular momentum and the intensity of\nthe outflow. This result implies that disc accretion and outflow/jet are essentially symbiotic and inseparable.\nAccording to the criterion (13) the BP efficiency of extracting angular momentum must be larger than unity, i.e.,\n\u03bb > 1 , and this implies the presence of some interaction\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n13\n\n4\n\nShakura N I, Sunyaev R A, Black holes in binary systems.\nObservational appearance.

In fact, a negative work is always done by the magnetic torque due to the presence of\nlarge-scale poloidal magnetic field in the BP process, acting at the induce current flowing radially on the disc. It is\nvery similar to the case that an external magnetic field always exerts torque on the induce eddy currents in a conductive disc. The parameter \u03bb and the outflow rate s\nare not independent. Essentially, \u03bb is related to the accelerating process of outflow, and it depends not only on the\nintensity and shape of large-scale magnetic fields, but also\non the outflow rate. The outflow with greater s leads to less\n\u03bb , since the outflow matter cannot be constrained rigidly\nto the field lines due to its inertia [14]. The detailed process\nof accelerating outflow is very complex, which is beyond\nthe scope of this paper.\n\n14\n15\n16\n17\n\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nDougados C and Whelan E (eds), Springer Verlag, 2006 (astro-ph/\n0607216)\nSpruit H C, Theory of magnetically powered jets. 2008, arXiv:\n0804.3096\nMiller J M, Raymond J, Reynolds C S et al, The accretion disk wind\nin the black hole GRO J1655-40.
