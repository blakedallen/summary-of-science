Although many proposals have been put forward, the achievement of multi-partite entangled states are still\nchallenging experimentally due to decoherence as well as the limitation of current techniques. This work focuses on\na combinatory system with superconducting devices embedded in a cavity. Among a variety of qubit candidates,\nsuperconducting devices such as Josephson junction circuits [1, 2], Josephson junctions [3, 4, 5], Cooper pair boxes\n[6, 7], and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) [8, 9, 10, 11, 12], have drawn particular interests\ndue to their potential for integrated devices. On the other hand, cavities are currently considered as excellent devices\nto achieve multiqubit entanglement for atoms, ions, quantum dots, and other charge qubits [13, 14, 15, 16].\nOur goal is to present ways for creating multi-partite entanglement of many rf SQUID qubits in cluster states\nand in W states in cavity QED. The cluster states [17] is the key ingredient in a measurement-based quantum\ncomputing (QC), i.e., one-way QC [18], with which we can carry out expected quantum gates by some single-qubit\noperations and detections. The general definition for the cluster state \u03c6{k} C is from the set of eigenvalue equations\nK (a) \u03c6{k}\n\nC\n\n= (\u22121)\u03baa \u03c6{k}\n\n(a)\n\nC\n\n, with K (a) = \u03c3x\n\n(b)\n\n\u2297\n\nb\u2208nghb(a)\n\n\u03c3z , and nghb(a) specifying the sites of all the neighbors of\n\nthe site a and \u03baa \u2208 {0, 1}. It has been shown that the cluster states can be created by photons in linear optic system\nand by atoms going through cavities [19, 20]. While for doing a one-way QC, the flying qubits, such as the moving\natoms and the photons, are not good candidates in view of an accurate manipulation on QC. In contrast, SQUID\nqubits embedded in cavities are always static, which would\n\u221a be good for one way QC if we could prepare them into\ncluster states. W states, whose general form is Wn = (1/ n) |n \u2212 1, 1i with |n \u2212 1, 1i being all the totally symmetric\nstates involving n-1 zeros and 1 one, are famous for their robustness to local measurement, even under qubit loss.\nThis makes W states useful for, e.g., quantum communication based on many nodes of a network. A lot of schemes\nfor W state preparation by atoms going through cavities have been proposed, e.g., a very recent scheme for rapidly\ncreating multi-atom W states under the cavity decay [21]. Compared with the moving atoms, the SQUID qubits,\nwithout movement in the cavities, are obviously more suitable for this job.\nOne of the favorable features of our schemes is that we only virtually couple the excited level. So our implementation\nsubspace is only spanned by the two lowest levels of the SQUIDs, which makes our scheme simpler than previous\nwork [10, 11], and very robust to decoherence due to spontaneous emission from the excited level. Moreover, auxiliary\nqubits [20] are not required in our scheme, which improves the efficiency of our implementation. Furthermore, we\nconsider in our treatment some imperfect factors, such as the cavity decay and various coupling strength of different\nSQUID qubits to the cavity mode and the external microwave.\nFor each SQUID, two lowest flux states and an excited state are employed in our model, as shown in Fig. 1\nwhere quantum information is encoded in |0i and |1i. The spacing between two neighboring SQUIDs is assumed\nto be much larger than the size of each SQUID ring (on the order of 10-100 \u03bcm) so that the interaction between\nany two SQUIDs is negligible. The SQUIDs are radiated by the cavity field and by a classical microwave pulse\nwhich are tuned respectively to \u03c9c = (\u03c902 \u2212 \u03b4) and \u03c9\u03bcw = (\u03c912 \u2212 \u03b4), with \u03c902 and \u03c912 resonant frequencies between\nlevels |0i and |2i , and |1i and |2i , respectively. \u03b4 is the detuning.\n\u0011 Hamiltonian of the SQUID can be written\n\u0010 The\nQ2\n\n(\u03a6 \u2212\u03a6\n\n)2\n\n\u03a6\n\nin an usual form [10, 22], i.e., Hsj = 2Cjj + j 2Ljxj \u2212 EJ cos 2\u03c0 \u03a60j , where the conjugate variables \u03a6j and Qj\nare, respectively, the magnetic flux threading the ring and the total charge on the capacitor of the jth-SQUID, with\nthe commutation relation [\u03a6j , Qj ] = i~. \u03a6xj is the static external flux applied to the ring of the jth-SQUID, and\nEJ = Icj \u03a60 /2\u03c0 is the maximum Josephson coupling energy of the jth-SQUID with Icj the critical current of the\njunction, and \u03a60 = h/2e the flux quantum. Under the action of a single-mode cavity field Hc = \u03c9c (a\u2020 a + 21 ), with\n~ = 1 assumed, and a\u2020 and a the creation and annihilation operators of the cavity mode, we have the interaction\nPN\nHamiltonian HI , HI = j=1 \u2212 L1j (\u03a6j \u2212 \u03a6xj )(\u03a6cj + \u03a6\u03bcwj ), where \u03a6cj and \u03a6\u03bcwj are the magnetic flux threading the\n\u2212\n\u2192\u2192\nring of the jth-SQUID generated by the magnetic component Bj (\u2212\nr , t) of the cavity field and the microwave pulse,\nR \u2212\n\u2192\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\nrespectively. \u03a6ij = sj Bj ( r , t) * d S j with i = c, \u03bcw corresponding to the cavity field and the microwave pulse,\nrespectively, and j = 1, 2, . . . , N regarding different qubits.\nFollowing the steps in [10], we get to the Hamiltonian of the system in the interaction picture H I =\nPN\n\u2020 \u2212i\u03b4t\n|0ijj h2| + gj aei\u03b4t |2ijj h0| + \u03a9j e\u2212i\u03b4t |1ijj h2| + \u03a9j ei\u03b4t |2ijj h1| .We can adiabatically eliminate the exj=1 gj a e\n\u0010\n\u0011\nPN\ncited level |2i by a similar way to in [23] and reach an effective Hamiltonian, HI\u2032 = j=1 \u03bbj a\u2020 |0ijj h1| + a |1ijj h0| ,\nwhere \u03bbj =\nHamiltonian,\n\ngj \u03a9j\n\u03b4j\n\nand Max {gj , \u03a9j }\u226a \u03b4j . Considering the influence from the cavity decay, we obtain following\n\nH=\n\nN\nX\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03ba\n\u03bbj a\u2020 |0ijj h1| + a |1ijj h0| \u2212 i a\u2020a,\n2\nj=1\n\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere \u03ba is the cavity decay rate, and we have assumed that \u03ba is much smaller than \u03bbj so that no quantum\njump due to the cavity decay actually occurs during the time evolution under our consideration. To obtain clus\u22121\nter states, we assume that the N SQUIDs are prepared initially in a product state |\u03c80 i = \u2297N\nj=1 |+ij |0iN where\n1\nj\n|+ij is the eigenstate of \u03c3x with eigenvalue 1. The cavity field is prepared in \u221a2 (|0ic + i |1ic ) , which is from\n\u221a\na resonant interaction of an ancilla qubit initially in the state (|0i \u2212 |1i) / 2 with a vacuum cavity. Before we\nget started, we assume the SQUIDs to be decoupled from the cavity field, and the microwave to remain off. By\nadjusting the level structure of the SQUID 1 and turning on the classical microwave to meet the condition in\nFig. 1, we reach Eq. (1) with N=1. A straightforward solution of Eq. (1) could yield |0ic |0i1 \u2192 |0ic |0i1 ,\n\u03bat\n\u03bat\n\u03bb1\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n|0ic |1i1 \u2192 e\u2212 4 {[ 4G\nsin (G1 t) + cos (G1 t)] |0ic |1i1 \u2212 i G\nsin (G1 t) |1ic |0i1 }, |1ic |0i1 \u2192 e\u2212 4 {[ 4G\nsin (G1 t) +\n1\n1\n1\nq\n\u03bat\n2\n\u03bb1\ncos (G1 t)] |1ic |0i1 \u2212i G1 sin (G1 t) |0ic |1i1 }, |1ic |1i1 \u2192 e\u2212 2 |1ic |1i1 , where G1 =\n\u03bb21 \u2212 \u03ba16 . If we choose the\n1\nevolution time of the system to be t1 = [arctan(\u2212 4G\n\u03ba ) + \u03c0]/G1 , the state evolution of the system is given by\n\u22121\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011 NY\n\u0010\n\u03bat1\n\u03bat\n\u03bat\n\u03bb1\n1\n\u2212 21\n\u2212 41 \u03bb1\n|\u03c8i1 = 12 [|0ic |0i1 + e\u2212 4 G\nsin\n(G\nt\n)\n|1i\n+\ni\n|1i\n\u03c3\nsin\n(G\nt\n)\n|0i\n+\ne\n|+ij |0iN , where\n|1i\n]\n\u2297\ne\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nc z\n1\n1\nG1\n1\n\nj=2\n\n\u03c3z1 = |1i11 h1| \u2212 |0i11 h0| , and the state is not normalized if \u03ba is not zero. The cluster states prepared below will be\nwritten also following this convention.\nOur next step is to adjust the level structure of the SQUID 1 back to the previous situation with decoupling to the\nradiation field, but adjusting the level structure of the SQUID 2 to do the same job as done on the SQUID 1.

For the Nth SQUID we stop the state\nq\n2\nevolution at tN = G1N [arctan(\u2212 4G\u03baN ) + \u03c0], with GN = \u03bb2N \u2212 \u03ba16 , then can obtain\n|\u03c8iN =\n\n1\n2N/2\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bbN \u2212 \u03batN\nN \u22121\n4\ne\n|0iN |xN \u22121 i +\nsin (GN tN ) |1iN \u03c3z\n|yN \u22121 i \u2297 |0ic .\nGN\n\n(3)\n\nTo check above state, we first assume \u03ba = 0, i.e., the ideal condition. In this case, Eq.

It is evident that\nboth F and P are going down with the qubit number and \u03ba. It is understandable that the preparation of a cluster state\nwith bigger size need longer time and is thereby affected more by the cavity decay. Thus in the presence of the cavity\ndecay, the size of the cluster states are limited. For example, if we want F > 0.95, in the case of \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = ... = \u03bb,the\nmaximal qubit number of the cluster state is 32, corresponding to F = 0.951. For a cluster state with more qubit, we\ncould created it step by step by connecting the few-qubit cluster states by quantum phase gates on the end qubits\nof the neighboring SQUID chains [24]. Moreover, to keep the system as stable as possible, we should not change the\nlevel spacing of each SQUID drastically. In this sense, we estimate the appearance of imperfection due to the time\ndelay of the level spacing adjustment, i.e., the undesired phases regarding the component states of the superposition.\nThis estimate is plotted also in Fig. 2.\nFrom now on, we turn to the generation of W states using SQUIDs. In contrast to the cluster state preparation by\nindividually manipulating the SQUIDS, we have to simultaneously couple all the SQUIDs in this case to the cavity\n3\n\n\fmode and to the microwave. Provided that the SQUIDs and the cavity mode are initially in the state\n\nN\nQ\n\nj=2\n\n|1i1 |0ij and\n\nthe vacuum state |0ic , respectively, we have the time evolution of the system by straightforwardly solving Eq. (1),\n|\u03c8(t)i =\n+\n\nN\nQ\n\nj=2\nN\nX\n\nk=2\n\n\u2212\nwhere A2 =\nt=\n\n4\u03c0\nB ,\n\nand\n\nN\nP\n\n\u03bb2j , and B =\n\nj=1\n\u03bb21 =\n\nN\nQ\n\nj=1\n\n|1i1 |0ij |0ic {1 +\n|1k i\n\nN\nQ\n\nj=1,j6=k\n\n|0ij |1ic\n\n|0ij |0ic\n\nk=2\n\n(5)\n\n\u221a\n16A2 \u2212 \u03ba2 . In order to obtain W states of (N-1) SQUIDs, we have the conditions\n\n\u03bat\n\nA\u20322 e 4 to be satisfied. Then the system evolves to\n\n\u03bat\n\nN\nP\n\n\u03bb1 \u03bbk\nBt\n\u03bat\n\u03ba\nBt\n[\u22121 + e\u2212 4 (cos\n+ sin\n)]\n2\nA\n4\nB\n4\n\nBt \u2212 \u03bat\ni4\u03bb1\nsin\ne 4.\nB\n4\n\nWN \u22121 = e\u2212 8\nwhere A\u20322 =\n\n\u03bat\n\u03ba\nBt\n\u03bb21\nBt\n[\u22121 + e\u2212 4 (cos\n+ sin\n)]}\nA2\n4\nB\n4\n\nN\nX\n\u03bbk\n\nk=2\n\nA\u2032\n\n|1k i\n\nN\nQ\n\nj=2,j6=k\n\n|0ij ,\n\n(6)\n\n\u03bb2k . This is a W state of (N-1) SQUIDs with arbitrary coefficients. By choosing the same coupling\n\nfor the rest (N-1) SQUIDs except the first one, we may produce a standard W state\nN\nX\nN\nQ\n1\n\u03bat\nWN \u22121 = e\u2212 8 \u221a\n|1k i\n|0ij ,\nN \u2212 1 k=2\nj=2,j6=k\n\u03bat\n\n(7)\n\nwith the success probability P = e\u2212 4 . We plot in Fig. 3 the success probability P versus cavity decay \u03ba. From\nabove condition for the evolving time, we have \u03bb1 = A\u2032 e\u03ba\u03c0/2B \u2265 A\u2032 , which means that for many-qubit case, the\ncoupling strength regarding the first qubit is much larger than those of others. This also implies that, the coupling\nstrength regarding other SQUIDs would be quite small if \u03bb1 is not big. Experimentally, the difference of \u03bb1 from other\ncoupling strength could be made by reducing the detuning regarding the first SQUID. Alternatively, we may put the\nfirst SQUID on the antinode of the cavity standing wave (i.e., the maximum coupling), but others on the positions\ndeviated from corresponding antinodes.\nWe address below the experimental feasibility of our schemes. The implementation time of our scheme should be\nmuch shorter than the cavity decay time \u03ba\u22121 = Q/2\u03c0\u03bdc, where Q is the quality factor of the cavity (Q= 106 \u2212 108\nhas been achieved experimentally [25], and for superconducting qubits [26]), and \u03bdc is the cavity field frequency.\nThe coupling constants of the SQUID to the cavity field and to the classical microwave available at present are\ng \u223c 1.8 \u00d7 108 s\u22121 , and \u03a9 \u223c 8.5 \u00d7 107 s\u22121 , respectively [27]. So we may have an effective coupling \u03bb \u223c 10 MHz if\nassuming \u03b4 \u223c 1.5 GHz. In this case, the interaction time \u03c4 is on the order of 10\u22127 sec, much shorter than \u03ba\u22121 \u223c 4\u00d710\u22125\n(with Q = 107 and \u03bdc = 40GHz). This implies that our proposed states can be of the fidelity higher than 0.99 due\nto \u03ba/\u03bb = 4 \u00d7 10\u22122 .\nAlthough optical photons in cluster states have been experimentally demonstrated some important features for\none-way QC, we prefer fixed qubits, like the SQUIDs embedded in the cavity, for storing and processing quantum\ninformation. This statement is also applicable to the W state case for quantum information processing. Moreover,\ndue to no necessity of auxiliary qubits, our scheme could much reduce the experimental challenge for cluster state\npreparation. For example, generation of a two-qubit cluster state requires at least five steps in [19] due to the auxiliary\nstates involved, while only two steps are needed in our scheme. Furthermore, we only virtually couple the excited\nlevels throughout our scheme, which, compared to [10, 11], could both simplify the implementation steps and reduce\nthe possibility of decoherence due to spontaneous emission. We have given the analytical expressions of the prepared\ncluster state and W state under the cavity decay, and numerically assessed the related fidelities.\nBefore ending our discussion, we give few comments on our wavefunction treatment for the cavity decay. The\nquantum-jump approach [28] has been widely employed in solving dissipative dynamics for quantum systems, which\nlies in the time evolution governed by a non-Hermitian operator and interrupted by instantaneous jumps by the\ndetection of a photon. Normally, a solution by quantum-jump approach has to be resorted to numerical calculations.\n4\n\n\fIn our case, however, to prepare high-fidelity cluster states and W states, we prefer our implementation time much\nshorter than the cavity decay time. Therefore, we may only focus on the time evolution of the system governed\nby the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian Eq. (1) before the leakage of photons occurs. In this sense, our wavefunction\nmethod would be advantageous over the quantum-jump approach in the availability of analytical solution clearly\ndemonstrating the detrimental influence from the cavity decay on the prepared states. So our solutions might be\nhelpful in experiments for estimating the infidelity and correcting the error, particularly for implementation with\ncavities of comparatively low quality. This also implies that our numerical results in the last two figures are valid only\nwithin the regime of \u03ba/\u03bb \u226a 1 (e.g., \u03ba/\u03bb 6 0.1).\nIn summary, we have proposed potential schemes for creating cluster states and W states of many SQUIDs. Fast\nadjustments of the level spacings of individual SQUIDs are needed in the generation of the cluster states. As no\nauxiliary qubits or flying qubits involved, our scheme gives good candidates for one-way QC. In the generation of the\nW states, all the SQUIDs are coupled to the radiation fields simultaneously, which results in that the cavity decay\nonly affects the prepared states globally, instead of on the internal structure of the W state. Throughout our schemes,\nthe excited level is only virtually coupled, and we have specifically studied the detrimental influence from the cavity\ndecay. Our analytical results have shown clearly that the cluster states and the W states may be generated with\nhigh-fidelity only in the case of tiny cavity decay rate.\nThis work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants No. 10474118 and No.\n60490280, by Hubei Provincial Funding for Distinguished Young Scholars, and by the National Fundamental Research\nProgram of China under Grants No. 2005CB724502.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n\nJ.E.
