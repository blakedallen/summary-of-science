Although traditionally the\nmain approaches to this problem have been variational [1], in the last decade it has been\nattacked with success by means of semidefinite programming (SDP) formulations [2, 3, 4]\nof the constraints on second-order reduced density matrices proposed in [5, 6, 7] (the socalled 2-RDM method). These SDP methods can be viewed as particular instances of a\nmore general non-commutative polynomial optimization approach [8, 9], which extends to\nthe non-commutative setting the method developed by Lasserre [10] and Parrilo [11] for\nscalar polynomial optimization. Roughly speaking, a non-commutative optimization problem consists in finding the minimal eigenvalue of a hermitian polynomial of non-commutative\n1\n\n\foperators. To solve such problems, one can define a hierarchy of SDP relaxations, each of\nwhich corresponds to finding a sum of squares decomposition of the polynomial to be minimized which provides a lower bound pk on the optimal solution p\u22c6 of the original problem,\nwith p1 \u2264 p2 \u2264 ... \u2264 p\u22c6 . This approach reduces to the 2-RDM method when applied to\nfermionic systems, but more generally is also highly successful, e.g., to characterize the set\nof quantum correlations in quantum information science [12]. Recently, modifications of this\nalgorithm exploiting translational invariance have been proposed independently by H\u00fcbener\nand Barthel [13] and Baumgratz and Plenio [14] as an alternative to variational techniques\nin condensed matter physics. In [15, 13, 14], it was suggested to apply such SDP methods\nto compute the ground-state energy of bosonic systems, i.e., to find the minimal eigenvalue\nof Weyl polynomials.\nIn this article, we point out that any computer implementation of the SDP hierarchies [8,\n9] to bosonic systems will exhibit the non-commutative analog of an effect already observed\nin similar algorithms for commutative polynomial minimization [16], [17]. On one hand, it\ncan be proven that any relaxation beyond the first one will not provide better lower bounds\non p\u22c6 , i.e., pk = p1 for all k \u2265 1. On the other hand, numerically it is observed that the\nbounds p\u03021 , p\u03022 , ... output by the computer form an increasing sequence, with limk\u2192\u221e p\u0302k = p\u22c6 .\nWe will show that the resolution of this \"mathematical paradox\" follows the same lines as\nthe commutative one. Namely, even though there exist positive Weyl polynomials p that do\nnot admit a sum of squares decomposition, for any such polynomial there exists an arbitrarily\nsmall perturbation p \u2192 p\u0303 = p + \u01ebg such that p\u0303 can be decomposed as a sum of squares of\nWeyl polynomials. The rounding errors introduced by the computer while executing the\nalgorithm correspond to such a perturbation, and so numerical implementations of the SDP\nmethod converges to the correct answer of the problem. This is, therefore, an example of a\nnumerical method that converges, not in spite of rounding errors, but because of them.\nThis article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we provide the basic definitions and\nfacts about Weyl algebras that are used in the remaining of the text. In Section 3 we\nwill describe the SDP method and illustrate the paradox with a numerical example. The\nresolution of the paradox will be given in Section 4, where we will prove that any positive\nWeyl polynomial can be perturbed to a sum of squares of polynomials. Finally, in Section 5\nwe will present our conclusions.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nDefinitions and basic results on Weyl algebras\nWeyl algebras and Weyl polynomials\n\nA Weyl algebra Wn is a \u2217-algebra with 2n generators \u0101 = (a1 , a2 , ..., an ) and \u0101\u2217 = (a\u22171 , a\u22172 , ..., a\u2217n )\nsatisfying the canonical commutation relations (CCRs):\n[ai , aj ] = [a\u2217i , a\u2217j ] = 0, [ai , a\u2217j ] = \u03b4ij , for all i, j \u2208 {1, ..., n}.\n\n(1)\n\nAn element p of Wn is thus a linear combination (with complex coefficients) of words in the\n2n letters \u0101 and \u0101\u2217 . The words and elements of Wn can also be viewed as monomials and\npolynomials, respectively, in the 2n variables \u0101 and \u0101\u2217 .\n2\n\n\fUsing the CCRs, any element p of a Weyl algebra can be brought to the normal form\nX\n(2)\np=\nps\u0304,t\u0304 (a\u2217 )s\u0304 at\u0304 ,\ns\u0304,t\u0304\n\nQ\nwhere s\u0304 = (s1 , . . .Q\n, sn ), t\u0304 = (t1 , . . . , tn ) \u2208 Nn , at\u0304 denotes the monomial at\u0304 = ni=1 atii and\nsimilarly (a\u2217 )s\u0304 = ni=1 a\u2217i si , and where ps\u0304,t\u0304 \u2208 C are complex coefficients. For instance, the\nelements a1 a\u22171 and a1 a2 a\u22172 a\u22171 , expressed in normal form, are 1 + a\u22171 a1 and 1 + a\u22171 a1 + a2 a\u22172 +\na\u22171 a\u22172 a1 a2 , respectively. We will later show that the decomposition (2) is unique for each\np \u2208 Wn . To check whether two different polynomials p, p\u2032 in the variables \u0101, \u0101\u2217 represent the\nsame element p = p\u2032 \u2208 Wn it is therefore enough to write p, p\u2032 in normal form.\nThis last observation suggests a natural norm in Wn : let p \u2208 Wn , and let (2) be its\nnormal decomposition. Then, we define the l1 -norm of p as\nX\nl1 (p) \u2261\n|ps\u0304,t\u0304 |.\n(3)\ns\u0304,t\u0304\n\nIt is also useful to distinguish the elements of Wn by resorting to the concept of degree. We\nsay that the degree of an element p of Wn is deg(p) = max{ks\u0304k1 + kt\u0304k1 : ps\u0304t\u0304 6= 0}\nQ for p\nexpressed in normal form (2). It is easy to see that the degree of any monomial s = dk=1 sk\nwith sk \u2208 {aj , a\u2217j }nj=1 is equal to deg(s) \u2261 |s| = d.\nGiven a monomial s, we denote by \u2021s\u2021 its anti-normal ordering, that is, the monomial s\u2032\nthat results when we reorder the letters appearing in the expression of s in such a way that\nall the letters a1 , a2 , ..., an end up on the left and all the letters (a\u22171 , a\u22172 , ..., a\u2217n ) end up on the\nright. For example, \u2021a\u22172 (a\u22171 )2 a1 \u2021 = \u2021a\u22171 a1 a\u22171 a\u22172 \u2021 = a1 (a\u22171 )2 a\u22172 .\nIn this article, we will be mainly concerned with hermitian elements of Wn , i.e., those\npolynomials p such that p = p\u2217 . If p is decomposed as in (2), the hermiticity condition thus\ntranslates as ps\u0304,t\u0304 = p\u2217t\u0304,s\u0304 , where p\u2217t\u0304,s\u0304 denotes the complex conjugate of the number pt\u0304,s\u0304 .\n\n2.2\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger representation\n\nLet \u03c0 be a mapping \u03c0 : Wn \u2192 L(H), for some Hilbert space H, where L(H) denotes the\nspace of linear (not necessarily bounded) operators of H. We say that \u03c0 is a \u2217-representation\nof Wn if and only if\n1. \u03c0(1) = IH .\n2. \u03c0(pq) = \u03c0(p)\u03c0(q), \u03c0(p + q) = \u03c0(p) + \u03c0(q) for all p, q \u2208 Wn .\n3. \u03c0(p)\u2217 = \u03c0(p\u2217 ), for all p \u2208 Wn .\nWe now show that Wn admits a representation. For this, let H be a separable Hilbert space,\nand let {|si, s \u2208 N} be an orthonormal basis for H, which we call the number basis. If we\ndenote by \u00e3 \u2208 L(H) the linear operator defined by\n\u001a\n0\nfor s = 0,\n\u00e3|si = \u221a\ns|s \u2212 1i otherwise.\n3\n\n\fthen its adjoint \u00e3\u2217 satisfies\n\u00e3\u2217 |si =\n\n\u221a\n\ns + 1|s + 1i,\n\n(4)\n\nand so it can be verified that\n[\u00e3, \u00e3\u2217 ]|si = |si, for all s \u2208 N.\n\n(5)\n\nDefining H = H \u2297n , we can then build a representation \u03c0S : Wn \u2192 L(H) for the Weyl algebra\nWn through\n\u03c0S (ak ) = I\u2297k\u22121 \u2297 \u00e3 \u2297 I\u2297n\u2212k .\n(6)\nThis representation of Wn is known as the Schr\u00f6dinger (or Fock) representation. From now\non, we always refer to this representation and write \u03c0 for \u03c0S for simplicity.\n\n2.3\n\nWeyl polynomial minimization\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger representation admits a clear physical interpretation: given a set of n onedimensional particles, it associates to each particle k \u2208 {1, ..., n} a pair of creation and\nannihilation operators \u03c0(ak ), \u03c0(a\u2217k ). The operators describing the position and momentum\na +a\u2217\nof particle k along the real line are then given, respectively, by \u03c0(xk ) \u2261 \u03c0( k\u221a2 k ) and \u03c0(pk ) \u2261\na \u2212a\u2217\n\n\u03c0( k\u221a2i k ). If these particles are subject to a potential V (x1 , ..., xn ), the energy operator of\nthe system, in non-relativistic approximation, will be given by\n!\nn\nX\np2i\n\u03c0(E) = \u03c0\n+ V (x1 , ..., xn ) ,\n(7)\n2m\ni\ni=1\n\nwhere mi \u2208 R+ is the mass of particle i. In particular, the minimum energy of the system\nwill be given by\n\u03bbinf (E) = inf {h\u03c6|\u03c0(E)|\u03c6i : |\u03c6i \u2208 S, h\u03c6|\u03c6i = 1},\n(8)\nwhere S is the Schwartz space, that is, the set of states |\u03c6i (i.e., vectors of H) satisfying\nk\u03c0(p)\u03c6ik < \u221e for all p \u2208 Wn . Note that the minimization over h\u03c6|E|\u03c6i makes sense,\nbecause the energy is an hermitian operator, E = E \u2217 , and consequently, h\u03c6|E|\u03c6i \u2208 R is a\nreal quantity for all |\u03c6i \u2208 S.\nThe case where E is a polynomial in the variable xi , pj \u2013 or equivalently in the variables ai , a\u2217j \u2013 is particularly important (it includes for instance the case where the potential\nV (x1 , ..., xn ) is Taylor expanded around some equilibrium position). This motivates the\nfollowing generic Weyl polynomial optimization problem\n\u03bbinf (p) = inf {h\u03c6|\u03c0(p)|\u03c6i : |\u03c6i \u2208 S, h\u03c6|\u03c6i = 1},\n\n(9)\n\nfor an arbitrary hermitian polynomial p \u2208 Wn . Note that, alternatively, we can write\n\u03bbinf (p) = sup {\u03bb \u2208 R : \u03c0(p) \u2212 \u03bb \u2265 0},\n\n(10)\n\nwhere positivity is understood in the Schwartz space. This reformulation of the problem will\nbe used in the next section.\n4\n\n\f2.4\n\nCoherent states\n\nAn interesting subset of H is constituted by the coherent states. For any \u03b1 \u2208 C, denote by\n|\u03b1i \u2208 H the normalized state\ns\n|\u03b1|2 X \u03b1\n\u221a |si.\n|\u03b1i \u2261 e\u2212 2\n(11)\ns!\ns\u2208N\n\nThen, a coherent state in H is any state of the form |\u1fb1i = \u2297ni=1 |\u03b1i i, for any \u1fb1 \u2208 Cn . Coherent\nstates are important because they are simultaneous eigenstates of the annihilation operators\n{\u03c0(ak ) : k = 1, ..., n}. This follows from the easily verified identity \u00e3|\u03b1i = \u03b1|\u03b1i for all \u03b1 \u2208 C.\nAs a result, for any normally-ordered polynomial p \u2208 Wn , we have that\nX\n(12)\nh\u1fb1|\u03c0(p)|\u1fb1i =\nps\u0304,t\u0304 \u03b1\u2217 s\u0304 \u03b1t\u0304 \u2261 p(\u1fb1, \u1fb1\u2217 ).\ns\u0304,t\u0304\n\nAs an application of the coherent states, let us show that the decomposition (2) is unique,\nor, equivalently, that 0 admits a unique representation. Suppose thus that\nX\n(13)\n0=\nps\u0304,t\u0304 a\u2217 s\u0304 at\u0304 ,\ns\u0304,t\u0304\n\nfor some coefficients ps\u0304,t\u0304 \u2208 C. Using the Schr\u00f6dinger representation, we have that\nX\n0 = h\u1fb1|\u03c0(0)|\u1fb1i =\nps\u0304,t\u0304 \u03b1\u2217 s\u0304 \u03b1t\u0304 for all \u1fb1 \u2208 Cn .\n\n(14)\n\ns\u0304,t\u0304\n\nThe right-hand side is a polynomial in the complex variables \u1fb1, \u1fb1\u2217 , and it can only be equal\nto zero for all values of \u1fb1 if ps\u0304,t\u0304 = 0 for all s\u0304, t\u0304.\n\n3\n\nSOS decompositions, the SDP hierarchy, and the\nparadox\n\nGiven a hermitian polynomial p \u2208 Wn , we say that p admits a sum-of-squares (SOS) decomposition if there exist polynomials fi \u2208 Wn such that\nX\np=\nfi\u2217 fi .\n(15)\ni\n\nWe denote \u03a32 the set of all such polynomials. It is clear that if p \u2208 \u03a32 , then \u03c0(p) \u2265 0, since,\nfor any |\u03c6i \u2208 S,\nX\nh\u03c6|\u03c0(p)|\u03c6i =\nh\u03c6|\u03c0(fi\u2217)\u03c0(fi )|\u03c6i \u2265 0.\n(16)\ni\n\nHowever, the opposite implication is not true, not even in W1 . Indeed, as noted by Schm\u00fcdgen\n[18], the family of polynomials p\u01eb = (a\u22171 a1 \u2212 1)(a1 a\u22171 \u2212 2) + \u01eb satisfies \u03c0(p\u01eb ) \u2265 0, for \u01eb \u2265 0,\nbut nevertheless p\u01eb 6\u2208 \u03a32 , for \u01eb < 41 .\n5\n\n\fGiven a p \u2208 Wn , a possible scheme for finding a lower bound \u03bb\u22c6 on the solution \u03bbinf (p)\nof (10) is thus to solve the problem\n\u03bb\u22c6 \u2261 sup{\u03bb \u2208 R : p \u2212 \u03bb \u2208 \u03a32 }.\n\n(17)\n\nThis principle is the one behind the polynomial minimization algorithms developed by\nLasserre [10] and Parrilo [11], and their non-commutative analogue [8, 9]. Such algorithms\nwork by searching for SOS decompositions of p \u2212 \u03bb with some degree constraint. Applied to\nthe Weyl minimization problem, this results in the following sequence of programs:\n\u03bbk \u2261 sup{\u03bb \u2208 R : p \u2212 \u03bb \u2208 \u03a32k }.\n\n(18)\n\nHere k is an integer such that 2k \u2265 deg(p) and indexing the successive programs in the\nsequence and \u03a32k is the set of polynomials which admit a decomposition of the form (15)\nwith deg(fi ) \u2264 k, for all i. Each of these problems is a semidefinite program, as one can\ncheck that\n\u03bbk = max{\u03bb \u2208 R : p \u2212 \u03bb = (w\u0304 k )\u2217 Z w\u0304 k , Z \u2265 0},\n(19)\nwhere w\u0304 k is a vector whose components are the normally ordered monomials of degree \u2264 k.\nClearly, \u03bbk \u2264 \u03bbk+1 and limN \u2192\u221e \u03bbk = \u03bb\u22c6 . The programs (18), (19) thus form a converging\nhierarchy of SDP relaxations for the problem (17). Supplemented with a boundedness condition (that is not satisfied in the present case of Weyl polynomials), it can be further be\nshown that this hierarchy necessarily converges to the optimal solution of the problem (10)\n[8, 9], as problems (17) and (10) then turn out to be equivalent [19].\nLet L denote an arbitrary functional on the Weyl algebra, i.e., L : Wn \u2192 C. Then, the\ndual of problems (18), (19) can be shown to be\n\u03bck = min{L(p) : L(1) = 1, L(qq \u2217 ) \u2265 0 for all q \u2208 Wn , deg(q) \u2264 k},\n\n(20)\n\nor explicitly in SDP form\n\u03bck = min{\n\nX\ns\u0304,t\u0304\n\nps\u0304,t\u0304 ys\u0304,t\u0304 : y0\u0304,0\u0304 = 1, Mk (y) \u2265 0},\n\n(21)\n\nIn this last formulation, ps\u0304,t\u0304 are the coefficients of p in normal form (2), y \u2261 {ys\u0304,t\u0304 : ks\u0304 + t\u0304k1 \u2264\n2k} \u2282 C are the optimization variables1 , and Mk (y) is the moment matrix of order k, a\nmatrix whose rows and columns are indexed by pairs of vectors (s\u0304, t\u0304) \u2208 Nn \u00d7 Nn , with\nks\u0304 + t\u0304k1 \u2264 k, and with entries defined by\nX\n[Mk (y)](s\u0304,t\u0304),(\u016b,v\u0304) =\ncq\u0304,r\u0304 yq\u0304,r\u0304 ,\n(22)\nq\u0304,r\u0304\n\nwhere {cq\u0304,r\u0304 } are the normal form coefficients of the monomial (a\u2217 s\u0304 at\u0304 )\u2217 a\u2217 \u016b av\u0304 , i.e.,\nX\ncq\u0304,r\u0304 a\u2217 q\u0304 ar\u0304 .\n(a\u2217 s\u0304 at\u0304 )\u2217 a\u2217 \u016b av\u0304 =\nq\u0304,r\u0304\n\nThe next lemma shows that problems (18),(19) and (20),(21) are, in fact, equivalent:\n1\n\nNote that, if ps\u0304,t\u0304 \u2208 R, \u2200s\u0304, t\u0304, one can assume {ys\u0304,t\u0304 : ks\u0304 + t\u0304k1 \u2264 2k} \u2282 R.\n\n6\n\n(23)\n\n\fLemma 1. If there exists a feasible point of program (19), then \u03bck = \u03bbk .\nProof. By Sylvester's criterion [20], it just suffices to show that problem (20) admits a strictly\nfeasible point, i.e., that there exists a functional L such that L(1) = 1 and L(pp\u2217 ) > 0, for\nall p 6= 0. Now, consider the functional L(p) = tr(\u03a9 \u03c0(p)), with\nZ\n1\n2\n\u03a9=\nd\u1fb1 e\u2212|\u1fb1| |\u1fb1ih\u1fb1|.\n(24)\nn\n(2\u03c0)\nThis functional satisfies L(1) = 1. Also, for any non-zero polynomial p 6= 0 \u2208 Wn we have\nthat\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n2\n\u2212|\u1fb1|2\n\u2217\n\u2217\nd\u1fb1 e\nh\u1fb1|\u03c0(p p)|\u1fb1i \u2265\nd\u1fb1 e\u2212|\u1fb1| |h\u1fb1|\u03c0(p)|\u1fb1i|2\nL(p p) =\nn\nn\n(2\u03c0)\n(2\u03c0)\nZ\n1\n2\n=\nd\u1fb1 e\u2212|\u1fb1| |p(\u1fb1, \u1fb1\u2217 )|2 > 0.\n(25)\nn\n(2\u03c0)\nThe last inequality comes from the fact that p(\u1fb1, \u1fb1\u2032 ) 6= 0 and that the integration takes place\nin all Cn .\nEven though the above SDP hierarchy cannot be guaranteed to converge to the optimal\nvalue \u03bbinf (p) of (10), every SDP step provides a lower-bound on \u03bbinf (p). Based on the\nsuccessful applications of this SDP hierarchy to fermionic systems and quantum correlations,\nwhere in practice very good lower bounds are obtained after only a few SDP relaxations, one\ncould expect a good overall performance also in the context of Weyl polynomials. However,\nas the next result shows, no improvement over the first lower-bound can be obtained by\nconsidering higher steps in the hierarchy.\nLemma 2. Let p \u2208 \u03a32 . Then, p \u2208 \u03a32k for 2k \u2264 deg(p).\nProof. By hypothesis, p \u2208 \u03a32 , and thus there exist polynomials fi such that (4) holds. We\nwill show that all such polynomials satisfy 2deg(fi ) \u2264 deg(p).\nSuppose, on the contrary, that\nX\np=\nfi\u2217 fi + f \u2217 f,\n(26)\n\nwith 2deg(f ) > deg(p). Then,\n\np(\u1fb1, \u1fb1\u2217 ) = h\u1fb1|\u03c0(p)|\u1fb1i \u2265 h\u1fb1|\u03c0(f \u2217 )\u03c0(f )|\u1fb1i \u2265 |h\u1fb1|\u03c0(f )|\u1fb1i|2 = |f (\u1fb1, \u1fb1\u2217 )|2 .\nNow, denote by LT (f ) the leading terms of f , i.e.,\nX\nLT (f )(\u1fb1, \u1fb1\u2217) =\nfs\u0304,t\u0304 (\u03b1s\u0304 )\u2217 \u03b1t\u0304 ,\nks\u0304+t\u0304k1 =deg(f )\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\nand choose \u03b2\u0304 \u2208 Cn such that LT (f )(\u03b2\u0304, \u03b2\u0304 \u2217 ) = c 6= 0. Then it is straightforward that\n|f (r \u03b2\u0304, r \u03b2 \u0304\u2217)| = O(r deg(f ) ). However, |p(r \u03b2\u0304, r \u03b2\u0304 \u2217 )| \u2264 O(r deg(p) ). For (27) to hold, we must\nthus have that 2deg(f ) \u2264 deg(p).\n7\n\n\f1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n\u03bbinf (Em )\n\n0\n\u22120.5\n\u22121\n\u22121.5\n\n\u03bb2 SDPT3\u22124.0\nvariational\n\n\u22122\n\u22122.5\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\nm\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 1: Bounds on \u03bbinf (Em ) as a function of m. The upper curve represents an upper\nbound obtained through variational techniques. The lower curve represents the lower bound\n\u03bb2 corresponding to the first relaxation of the problem.\nWhat Lemma 2 shows is that, for any polynomial p, the sequence of values \u03bbk0 , \u03bbk0 +1 , ...,\nwith k0 = \u2308deg(p)/2\u2309 is constant and equal to \u03bb\u22c6 . In other words: the first SDP relaxation\nof the problem already provides the best approximation to \u03bbinf (p) attainable with SOS\ndecompositions.\nHow does such an approximation perform? Consider the uniparametric family of onedimensional hamiltonians {Em : m \u2208 R}, with\n1\nEm = p\u03032 + mx\u03032 + x\u03034 ,\n(29)\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwith x\u0303 \u2261 (\u00e3 + \u00e3\u2217 )/ 2, p\u0303 \u2261 (\u00e3 \u2212 \u00e3\u2217 )/i 2. Note that, for m < 0, Em corresponds to the\ninteresting double-well potential. Figure 1 shows a plot of \u03bb2 as a function of m, together\nwith an upper bound on Em obtained through variational methods. We used the solver\nSDPT3-4.0 [21] and the MATLAB package YALMIP [22] to carry out the SDP calculations.\nIt is clear that, as soon as m < 0, the approximation given by \u03bb2 becomes worse.\nFrom our discussions above, it follows that \u03bb2 = \u03bb3 = \u03bb4 = ..., and so \u03bb2 represents the\nbest lower bound on \u03bbinf (em ) achievable with the SDP hierarchy. Figure 2 shows, however,\nthat such is not the case. Indeed, we see that subsequent relaxations of the problem return\nlower bounds which are closer and closer to the variational upper bound, until, at \u03bb6 , both\nbounds become practically indistinguishable.

Lasserre successfully solved\nthis paradox by proving that any commutative positive polynomial can be approximated arbitrarily well by an SOS decomposition [23]. The accepted resolution of the paradox was that\nthe rounding errors occurring during the numerical computations perturbed the polynomial\np to be minimized to another one of higher degree admitting an SOS decomposition [17].\nIn this Section we will prove a non-commutative analog of this result, namely, that\nWeyl polynomials which are positive semidefinite in the Schr\u00f6dinger representation can be\nperturbed to a higher degree polynomial in \u03a32 . This is formally stated in the following\nTheorem:\nTheorem 3. Let p be an element of Wn such that \u03c0(p) \u2265 0. Then, for any \u01eb, \u03b4 > 0, there\nexists a polynomial p\u0303 \u2208 \u03a32 such that l1 (p \u2212 p\u0303) < \u01eb and |\u03bbinf (p\u0303) \u2212 \u03bbinf (p)| < \u03b4.\nThe proof of this theorem follows straightforwardly from the next three lemmas. In these\nlemmas, the constant c is arbitrary but fixed to be c > 2.\n\n9\n\n\fLemma 4. Let p \u2208 Wn be a polynomial such that \u03c0(p) \u2265 0.

Let p be a hermitian polynomial in Wn such that \u03bbinf (p) exists, and let gcr be\ndefined as in (30). Then, for any \u03b4 > 0, there exists a number q \u2208 R+ such that\n\u03bbinf (p) \u2264 \u03bbinf (p + \u01ebgcr ) \u2264 \u03bbinf (p) + \u03b4 + \u01ebq,\n\n(33)\n\nfor all r, \u01eb > 0.\nThe proofs of Lemma 4 and 6 are given here below. The proof of Lemma 5 follows\nfrom the results presented in Appendix A. This Lemma implies that p and p\u0303r can be made\narbitrarily close if we\ntake \u01eb small enough. Moreover, if we express p \u2212 p\u0303r in the anti-normal\nP\nP\nform, i.e., p \u2212 p\u0303r = s\u0304,t\u0304 pas\u0304,t\u0304 as\u0304 (as\u0304 )\u2217 , the corresponding natural norm l1a (p \u2212 p\u0303r ) \u2261 s\u0304,t\u0304 |pas\u0304,t\u0304 | is\ntrivially bounded by \u01eb* e1/c . This implies that any computer implementation of program (19)\nwhere the polynomial to minimize is expressed in normal or anti-normal form will require a\nlot of precision in order to distinguish p\u0303r from p for low values of \u01eb.\nProof of Lemma 4. The demonstration of this Lemma will make use of two lemmas, proven\nin Appendices B, C, respectively.\nLemma 7. Let s \u2208 Wn be a monomial. Then,\n\u2021 ss\u2217 \u2021 \u2212ss\u2217 \u2208 \u03a32 .\n\n(34)\n\nLemma 8. Let L be a linear functional in Wn . If L(h\u2217 h) \u2265 0 for any h \u2208 Wn and there\nexist c, d > 0, k \u2208 N such that for any monomial s \u2208 Wn , the relation\n|s| + k + 1\n)\n(35)\n2\nholds, then there exists a non normalized quantum state \u03c1 (i.e., a non-negative, trace-class\noperator) such that L(h) = tr(\u03c1\u03c0(h)), for any polynomial h \u2208 Wn .\n|L(s)| \u2264 dc|s| \u0393(\n\n10\n\n\fLet us now proceed with the proof of Lemma 4. Following Lasserre et al. [24], let Wn (r)\nbe the set of elements of Wn with degree less or equal than r, and consider the semidefinite\nprogram:\n\u01eb\u22c6r = min L {L(p)|L : Wn (2r) \u2192 R, L linear , L(gcr ) \u2264 1, L(h\u2217 h) \u2265 0, \u2200h \u2208 Wn (r)}.\n\n(36)\n\nNoting that L = 0 is an admissible linear functional, we have that the problem has feasible points and that \u01eb\u2217r \u2264 0. Condition L(gcr ) \u2264 1, together with Lemma 7, implies that\nthe diagonal entries of all feasible moment matrices Mr (y) are upper bounded, and so the\nabsolute values of the rest of the entries, due to positive semidefiniteness. From these two\nobservations, it follows that our problem admits a solution, i.e., \u01eb\u22c6r 6= \u2212\u221e is attainable for a\nfeasible choice of L.\nThe dual of (36) is\nmax \u01eb {\u2212\u01eb : \u01eb \u2265 0, p + \u01ebgcr \u2208 \u03a32 }.\n\n(37)\n\n\u03bcs\u2217 t + \u03bc\u2217 t\u2217 s + |\u03bc|{s\u2217 s + t\u2217 t} \u2208 \u03a32 .\n\n(38)\n\nThat this problem has solutions for any p = p\u2217 follows from the fact that, for all \u03bc \u2208 C and\nany pair of monomials s, t \u2208 Wn ,\nAnd thus, invoking Lemma 7,\n\n\u03bcs\u2217 t + \u03bc\u2217 t\u2217 s + |\u03bc|{\u2021s\u2217s \u2021 + \u2021 t\u2217 t\u2021} \u2208 \u03a32 .\n\n(39)\n\u01ebgcr\n\n2\n\nBy increasing the value of \u01eb, at some point we will therefore have that p +\n\u2208\u03a3 .\nMoreover, in this particular case, there is no duality gap, i.e., the solutions of both the\nprimal and dual problems coincide. Again, this can be established by invoking the quantum\nstate (24): choosing \u03c3 > 0 such that tr{\u03a9\u03c0(gcr )} < 1/\u03c3, it follows that L(h) \u2261 \u03c3tr(\u03a9\u03c0(h))\nis a strictly feasible point of (36) and, thus, the solutions of the dual and primal problems\nare the same [20].\nThis, together with the fact that gcs \u2212 gcr is a sum of squares for s \u2265 r, implies that, for\nall \u01eb \u2265 \u2212\u01eb\u22c6r \u2265 0, the polynomial\np + \u01ebgcs (s \u2265 r)\n\n(40)\n\nis also a sum of squares.\nThe sequence (\u01eb\u22c6r )r is, therefore, and increasing one. We will next proof that limr\u2192\u221e \u01eb\u22c6r =\n0, and so that the \u01eb > 0 appearing in the formulation of Lemma 4 can be taken arbitrarily\nsmall.\nConsider the sequence L\u22c6r of functionals that attain the solutions \u01eb\u22c6r of the problem, and\ndenote by Mr\u22c6 their corresponding moment matrices (the entries (Mr\u22c6 )(s\u0304,t\u0304),(\u016b,v\u0304) where either\nks\u0304 + t\u0304k1 > r or k\u016b + v\u0304k1 > r are assumed to be completed with zeros). By Lemma 7, we\nhave that\n(Mr\u22c6 )(s\u0304,t\u0304),(s\u0304,t\u0304) \u2264 (Mr\u22c6 )(s\u0304+t\u0304,0),(s\u0304+t\u0304,0) \u2264\n\n(n + ks\u0304 + t\u0304k1 \u2212 1)! ks\u0304+t\u0304k1\nc\n=: d(s\u0304, t\u0304).\n(n \u2212 1)!\n11\n\n(41)\n\n\fNow, perform the transformation\n(Mr\u22c6 )(s\u0304,t\u0304),(\u016b,v\u0304) \u2192 (Nr\u22c6 )(s\u0304,t\u0304),(\u016b,v\u0304) \u2261 d(s\u0304, t\u0304)1/2 (Mr\u22c6 )(s\u0304,t\u0304),(\u016b,v\u0304) d(\u016b, v\u0304)1/2 .\n\n(42)\n\nNr\u22c6 is thus positive semidefinite and its diagonals are upper bounded by 1 for all r; it follows\nthat all the entries of the matrices Nr\u22c6 are in the interval [1, \u22121]. By the Banach-Alaoglu\ntheorem, the sequence Nr\u22c6 admits a subsequence {ri } that converges in the weak-\u2217 topology\nto a limit Nr\u22c6i \u2192 N\u0302 when i \u2192 \u221e [25]. Undoing the previous change of coordinates, we are left\nP\nwith an infinite sized matrix M\u0302 that defines a linear functional L\u0302(p) \u2261 s\u0304,t\u0304 p(s\u0304,t\u0304) M\u0302(0,s\u0304),(0,t\u0304)\non the Weyl algebra.\n\u2217\nThis functional satisfies\nj \u2265k 0, for any polynomial h.

On the other\nhand, \u01eb\u22c6r \u2264 0 \u2200r, and, therefore, we have that limr\u2192\u221e \u01eb\u22c6r = 0.\n\u0003\nProof of Lemma 6. Given a vector m\u0304 \u2208 Nn , we will denote by |m\u0304i the number state\n|m1 i \u2297 |m2 i \u2297 ... \u2297 |mn i. Now, if \u03c0(p) \u2265 0, then \u03bbinf (p) exists and can be written as the\nlimit of a sequence of the form h\u03c6i |\u03c0(p)|\u03c6i i, where {\u03c6i } are normalized quantum states. Such\nstates can be, in turn, approximated with arbitrary precision by finite linear combinations\nof\nP number states. Choose, then, a number M \u2208 N such that the normalized state |\u03a6i \u2261\nkm\u0304k\u221e \u2264M dm\u0304 |m\u0304i satisfies \u03bbinf (p) \u2264 h\u03a6|\u03c0(p)|\u03a6i \u2264 \u03bbinf (p) + \u03b4.\nIt can be verified that, for any pair of number states |m\u0304i, |m\u0304\u2032 i, with km\u0304k\u221e , km\u0304\u2032 k\u221e \u2264 M,\nand any monomial s of the annihilation and creation operators, the inequality |hm\u0304|ss\u2217 |m\u0304\u2032 i| \u2264\n(|s|+M )!\n\u03b4m\u0304,m\u0304\u2032 holds.

Equaling to q the last result, we arrive at the promised Lemma.\n\u0003\nNote that Lemma 8 alone provides an alternative explanation for the observed convergence to the optimal solution, this time from the point of view of the dual problem (20).\nThe reason why \u03bck does not necessarily converge in theory to \u03bbinf (p) for the exact problem\nis because the values L(s) in each program grow faster than dc|s| \u0393( |s|+l\n). If, however, due\n2\nto finite numerical precision our solvers limit the magnitude of such momenta, low order\nrelaxations \u03bck should provide a better approximation to \u03bbinf 2 .\nIncreasing the numerical precision of our programs should thus have a two-fold effect:\non one hand, it should allow the computer to distinguish between p and its perturbation p\u0303.\nOn the other hand, it should extend the moment matrix search space to include matrices\nwith entries of very different magnitude. A high precision numerical computation should\ntherefore make the curves in Figure 2 collapse to the same line.\nWe used the semidefinite programming solver SDPA-GMP [4, 26] to compute SDP approximations of E\u22121 , E1 with a precision of 600 digits. Figures 3 and 4 show the outputs\n\u03bbk \u2212 \u03bb2 of both problems as a function of lambdaStar, an internal parameter of SDPA-GMP\nthat constrains the magnitudes of the entries of the moment matrix3 [26]. Notice that, in\nagreement with the above interpretation, the difference between \u03bbk and \u03bb2 = \u03bb\u22c6 tends to\nzero as the constraints on the moment matrix disappear (right end of Figures 3 and 4). Conversely, the solutions of higher order relaxations start to differ from \u03bb2 and become closer to\nthe actual solution of the problem as we restrict the magnitude of the entries of the moment\nmatrix (left end of Figures 3 and 4).\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have identified a paradoxical behaviour in the application to bosonic systems of the SDP\nmethods widely used in quantum chemistry energy calculations and quantum information.\nNamely, we have pointed out that numerical implementations of the method seems to converge despite a simple theoretical argument showing that the first SDP relaxation should\nalready provide the best lower-bound to the problem at hand. This phenomenon is similar\nto an analogous behavior observed in commutative polynomial optimization [16, 17] and we\nsuggested that the paradox arises from rounding errors introduced in the numerical comutation. We provided a theoretical basis for this assumption by proving that for any bosonic\nhamiltonian to be minimized there exists a perturbation of it whose ground state energy can\naccurately be approximated by the SDP method. Furthermore, we showed that the effect\ndisappears as soon as we increase the computer precision.\nOur results suggest that the above problem could be avoided by constraining the values of\nthe diagonal elements of the moment matrices in each program. Thanks to such constraints,\n2\nThis does not apply to high order relaxations corresponding to k \u226b 1, as a constraint of the form\nL(akj (akj )\u2217 ) < K becomes unimplementable as soon as K > k!.\n3\nMore concretely, lambdaStar is such that (lambdaStar) * I \u2212 Mk (y) \u2265 0.\n\n13\n\n\f0\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22126\n\n\u03bbk \u2212 \u03bb2\n\n10\n\n\u22128\n\n10\n\n\u221210\n\n10\n\nk=5\nk=4\n\n\u221212\n\n10\n\nk=3\n\u221214\n\n10\n\n\u221216\n\n10\n\n1e10\n\n1e20\n\n1e30\n\n1e40\nlambdaStar\n\n1e50\n\n1e60\n\n1e70\n\nFigure 3: Plot of \u03bbk \u2212 \u03bb2 as a function of the parameter lambdaStar in the case m = \u22121.\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22125\n\n\u03bbk \u2212 \u03bb2\n\n10\n\n\u221210\n\n10\n\nk=5\nk=4\nk=3\n\u221215\n\n10\n\n1e10\n\n1e20\n\n1e30\n\n1e40\nlambdaStar\n\n1e50\n\n1e60\n\n1e70\n\nFigure 4: Plot of \u03bbk \u2212 \u03bb2 as a function of the parameter lambdaStar in the case m = 1.\n14\n\n\fcomputer implementations of the primal problem could return reliable solutions without\nhaving to resort to extremely high precision numerical calculations. This approach will be\nexplored in a forthcoming article.\nIt is worth noting that Cimpri\u010d [27] proposed to use Schm\u00fcdgen's positivstellensatz for\nWeyl algebras [18] to introduce a different SDP hierarchy than the one presented here in\norder to find rigorous lower bounds on the minimum value of arbitrary Weyl polynomials.\nThe application of this method, however, requires high precision SDP solvers.\nLet us conclude with a problem for the Noncommutative Real Algebraic Geometry community. We have shown that the set of SOS polynomials is dense in the set of positive\nsemidefinite elements of the Weyl algebra, i.e., we can approximate any polynomial which is\npositive semidefinite in the Schr\u00f6dinger representation by a SOS. It would be interesting to\nknow if this kind of results also hold in other algebras important for quantum chemistry. For\ninstance, if such an 'approximation property' were also true in algebras containing coulombian elements of the type 1/|x\u0304i \u2212 x\u0304j |, then we would be able to estimate electronic molecular\nenergies without the need of introducing orbital basis sets.\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nM.

For instance,\nthe configuration n1 = 2, n2 = 0, n3 = 1 would be represented by \"..||.\".\nIt is elementary that the number of permutations of n + k \u2212 1 elements, out of which\n.\nn \u2212 1 and k are indistinguishable, is equal to (n+k\u22121)!\n(n\u22121)!k!\nProof of Lemma 9.
