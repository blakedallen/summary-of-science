Motivated by the study of invariant rings of finite groups on the\nfirst Weyl algebras A1 ([1]) and finding interesting families of new noetherian\nrings, a class of algebras similar to U (sl2 ) were introduced and studied by\nSmith in [13]. Since the introduction of these algebras, research efforts have\nbeen focused on understanding their weight modules, and many important\nresults were already obtained in [13] and [6]. But it seems that not much\nhas been done on the part of nonweight modules. In this note, we generalize\nKostant's results in [5] on the Whittaker model for the universal enveloping\nalgebras U (g) of finite dimensional semisimple Lie algebras g to Smith's algebras. As a result, a complete classification of irreducible Whittaker modules\n(which are definitely infinite dimensional) for Smith's algebras is obtained, and\nthe submodule structure of any Whittaker module is also explicitly described.\n\nIntroduction\nMotivated by the study of the invariant rings of finite groups on the first Weyl\nalgebra A1 and other important things, an interesting class of algebras R(f ) similar to U (sl2 ) were introduced and studied by Smith in [13]. Each algebra R(f )\nis generated by three generators E, F, H subject to the relations EF \u2212 F E =\nf (H), HE \u2212 EH = E, and HF \u2212 F H = \u2212F , where f is a polynomial in H. These\nalgebras serve as a subclass of Witten's 7-parameter deformations of U (sl2 ) as studied in [6]. As their name indicates, these algebras share a lot of similar properties\nwith U (sl2 ). The ring theoretic properties and the highest weight modules were\nfirst investigated in detail in [13]. These algebras are somewhat commutative noetherian domain, and have the GK-dimension 3 ([13]). The center Z(R) of R(f ) is\nalso proved to be isomorphic to the polynomial ring in one variable. The primitive\nideals are classified by Smith ([13]). Furthermore, a similar theory of highest weight\nmodules and the category O is also constructed for these algebras by Smith ([13]).\nIn particular, for some special parameters f , all finite dimensional representations\nof R(f ) are semisimple. For more details, we refer the reader to [13]. These algebras\nhave also been further studied in [4] and [6] from the points of views of both ring\ntheoretic properties and representation theory.\nSince the introduction of these algebras, a lot of research efforts have been focused\non trying to understand their weight modules ([13], [6]). But it seems to us that\nnot much has been done for the part of nonweight modules. So it might be useful\nto present some specific constructions for nonweight irreducible modules over these\nalgebras. In this paper, we are able to work out such a possibility by generalizing\nDate: Oct 2006.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 17B55, 20G; Secondary 17B50.\nKey words and phrases. Algebras similar to U (sl2 ), Whittaker model, Whittaker modules.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nXIN TANG\n\nKostant's results on the Whittaker model for the universal enveloping algebras\nU (g) of finite dimensional semisimple Lie algebras g to Smith's algebras R(f ).\nAs an application, we obtain a complete classification of all irreducible Whittaker\nmodules, and the submodule structure of any Whittaker module is also completely\ndetermined.\nThe initial investigation of the Whittaker model and hence Whittaker modules\nfor semisimple Lie algebras was started by Kostant in the seminal paper [5]. The\nstudy of Whittaker modules is closely related the Whittaker equations and has\nnice applications in the theory of Toda lattice. For a nonsingular character of\nthe nilpotent subalgebra n+ of g, Kostant introduced the Whittaker model of the\ncenter Z(g) of U (g) for finite dimensional semisimple Lie algebras g. Whittaker\nmodel was used to study the structure of Whittaker modules over U (g) and several\nimportant structure theorems were proved by Kontant for Whittaker modules in [5].\nNote that Whittaker modules are very similar to Verma modules. But Whittaker\nmodules have a special feature in that they are irreducible if and only if they admit a\ncentral character, which is is not always the case for Verma modules. The Whittaker\nmodel was later on generalized and studied for singular characters of n+ by Lnych\nin his Ph.D. thesis [7]. Other similar works on this subject also appeared in [9] and\n[10]. As a matter of fact, Verma modules and Whittaker modules are two extreme\ncases of generalized Whittaker modules ( [7], [9] and [10]). Furthermore, generalized\nWhittaker modules are mapped to holonomic D\u2212modules on the flag variety of g via\nthe Beilinson-Bernstein localization ([2]). Based on this observation, a geometric\nstudy of Whittaker modules for finite dimensional semisimple Lie algebras was\ncarried out in [9] and [10].\nIn addition, a quantum analogoue of the Whittaker model has been constructed\nby Sevoastyanov for the topological version Uh (g) of quantized enveloping algebras\nby using their realizations via Coxeter elements in [14]. The major difficutly of a\ndirect generalization of Kostant's results to the quantized case lies in the fact that\nthere is no nonsingular character for the positive part of the quantized enveloping\nalgebras because of the quantized Serre relations. To resolve this issue, he has to\nturn to the topological version of quantized enveloping algebras which has different\nrealizations admitting nonsingular characters for the positive part. In the case of\ng = sl2 , the situation is slightly different, since the quantized Serre relations are\nvaccum. Thus a direct generalization of Kostant's approach should work. And this\nhas recently been worked out by Ondrus in [11]. We have to admit that it is just a\npure luck that a similar pattern works for Smith's algebras.\nNow let us mention a bit about the organization of this paper. In Section 1, we\nrecall the definition of Smith's algebras and some basic results on their properties.\nIn Section 2, we construct the Whittaker model of the center Z of R(f ), and classify\nall irreducible Whattaker modules. In Section 3, we investigate the submodule\nstructure of any Whittaker module. Throughout this paper, the base field will\nbe assumed to be C, though the results hold over any algebraically closed field of\ncharacteristic zero.\n\n1. Algebras similar to U (sl2 )\nIn this section, we recall the definition and basic properties of the algebras R(f )\nsimilar to U (sl2 ) as introduced by Smith in [13].\n\n\fWHITTAKER MODEL OF R(f )\n\n3\n\nDefinition 1.1. (See [13]) Let f be a polynomial in H, the algebra R(f ) is defined\nto be the C\u2212algebra generated by E, F, H subject to the following relations:\nEF \u2212 F E = f (H), HE \u2212 EH = E, HF \u2212 F H = \u2212F.\nand R(f ) is called an algebra similar to U (sl2 ). We will sometimes denote it by R\nin short.\nProposition 1.1. (See [13]) R(f ) has GK\u2212dimenion 3.\n\u2737\nProposition 1.2. (See [13]) R(f ) is a somewhat commutative algebra.\n\u2737\nCorollary 1.1. If V is a simple module, then every element of EndR(f ) (V ) is a\nscalar.\nProof: This follows from Quillen's Lemma and the fact R is a somewhat commutative algebra ([13]). For more detail, we refer the reader to [13].\n\u2737\nLet R(E) denote the subalgebra of R(f ) generated by E, and R(F, H) the subalgebra generated by F, H. Then we have\nProposition 1.3. R(F, H) is isomorphic to the enveloping algebra of the two dimensional nonabelian Lie algebra.\nProof: The proof is obvious.\nFrom [13], we have the following fact:\n\n\u2737\n\nProposition 1.4. For any polynomial f (H), there exist another polynomial u(H)\nsuch that f = 12 \u2206(u) = 21 (u(H + 1) \u2212 u(H)).\n\u2737\nIn addition, R(f ) has a Casimir element \u03a9 which is defined as \u03a9 = 2F E+u(H+1)\nand a simple caculation shows the following:\nProposition 1.5. (See [13]) The center Z(R) of R is a polynomial ring generated\nby one variable \u03a9 = 2F E + u(H + 1) over C, where u is the polynomial such that\nf (H) = 1/2\u2206(u).\n\u2737\n2. The Whittaker Model for the center Z(R) of R(f )\nIn this seciton, we work out the Whittaker model for the center Z(R(f )) of\nR(f ), and use it to study Whittaker modules over R(f ). We obtain similar results\nas in [5]. In fact, We will closely follow the formulation in [5] with some slight\nmodifications.\nDefinition 2.1. An algebra homomorphism \u03b7 : R(E) \u2212\u2192 C is called a nonsingular\ncharacter of R(E) if \u03b7(E) 6= 0.\nDefinition 2.2. Let V be an R\u2212module, a vector v \u2208 V is called a Whittaker\nvector of type \u03b7 if E acts on it through a nonsingular character \u03b7, i.e., Ev = \u03b7(E)v.\nIf V = Rv, then we call V a Whittaker module of type \u03b7, and v is called a cyclic\nWhittaker vector of type \u03b7.\n\n\f4\n\nXIN TANG\n\nFrom now on, we fix such a nonsingular character \u03b7 of R(E). The following\nproposition follows from the triangular decomposition of R in [13]:\nProposition 2.1. R is isomorphic to R(F, H) \u2297 R(E) as vector spaces and R is a\nfree module over R(E).\n\u2737\nLet \u03b7 : R(E) \u2212\u2192 C be the fixed nonsingular character of R(E), and we denote\nby R\u03b7 (E) the kernel of the character \u03b7. Then we have\nProposition 2.2. R(E) = C \u2295 R\u03b7 (E). Thus R \u223c\n= R(F, H) \u2295 RR\u03b7 (E).\nProof: Since R(E) = C \u2295 R\u03b7 (E) and R = R(F, H) \u2297 (C \u2295 R\u03b7 (E)), so R \u223c\n=\nR(F, H) \u2295 RR\u03b7 (E).\n\u2737\nNow we can define a projecton \u03c0 : R \u2212\u2192 R(F, H) from R into R(F, H) by taking\nthe R(F, H) component of any u \u2208 R. We denote the image \u03c0(u) of u by u\u03b7 for\nshort.\nLemma 2.1. If v \u2208 Z(R), then we have u\u03b7 v \u03b7 = (uv)\u03b7 .\nProof: Let u, v \u2208 Z(R), then we have\nuv \u2212 u\u03b7 v \u03b7 = (u \u2212 u\u03b7 )v + u\u03b7 (v \u2212 v \u03b7 ) = v(u \u2212 u\u03b7 ) + u\u03b7 (v \u2212 v \u03b7 ) \u2208 RR\u03b7 (E).\nSo (uv)\u03b7 = u\u03b7 v \u03b7 .\n\u2737\nProposition 2.3. \u03c0 : Z(R) \u2212\u2192 R(F, H) is an algebra isomorphism of Z(R) onto\nits image W (F, H) in R(F, H).\nProof: It follows from that above lemma that \u03c0 is a homomorphism of algebras.\nSince Z(R) = C[\u03a9] and \u03c0(\u03a9) = 2\u03b7(E)F + u(H + 1) which is not zero in W (F, H),\nso \u03c0 is a bijection. Hence \u03c0 is an algebra isomorphism from Z(R) onto its image\nW (F, H) in R(F, H).\n\u2737\nLemma 2.2. If u\u03b7 = u, then we have u\u03b7 v \u03b7 = (uv)\u03b7 for any v \u2208 R.\nProof:uv \u2212 u\u03b7 v \u03b7 = (u \u2212 u\u03b7 )v + u\u03b7 (v \u2212 v \u03b7 ) = u\u03b7 (v \u2212 v \u03b7 ) \u2208 RR\u03b7 (E). So we have\nu v = (uv)\u03b7 for any v \u2208 R.\n\u2737\nLet \u00c3 be the subalgebra of R generated by H. Now we introduce a new gradation\non R by setting deg(H) = 1, deg(E) = deg(F ) = deg(f ) + 1. This gradation\nis motivated by the so called x0 \u2212gradation suggested by Kazhdan (see [5]) for\nthe universal eveloping algebras U (g) of semisimple Lie algebras g. Let us denote\ndeg(f ) by d. We can define a filtration of R(F, H) as follows:\n\u03b7 \u03b7\n\nR(k) (F, H) = \u2295i(d+1)+j\u2264k Ri,j (F, H)\nwhere Ri,j (F, H) is the vector space spanned by F i H j . Since W (F, H) is a subalgebra of R(F, H), it inherits a filtration from R(F, H). In addition, \u00c3 has the natural\ngrading with deg(H) = 1. Let us put W (F, H)q = C \u2212 spann{1, \u03a9\u03b7 , * * * , (\u03a9\u03b7 )q },\nthen we have the following:\nTheorem 2.1. R(F, H) is free as a right module over W (F, H). And the multiplication induces an isomorphism\n\u00c3 \u2297 W (F, H) \u2212\u2192 R(F, H)\nas right W (F, H)\u2212modules. In particular, we have the following\n\u2295p+q(d+1)=k \u00c3p \u2297 W (F, H)q \u223c\n= R(F, H)(k)\n\n\fWHITTAKER MODEL OF R(f )\n\n5\n\nProof: First of all, \u00c3 \u00d7 W (F, H) \u2212\u2192 R(F, H) is bilinear. So by the universal\nproperty of the tensor product, there is a linear map from \u00c3\u2297W (F, H) into R(F, H)\ndefined by multiplication. It is easy to see this map is a homomorphism of right\nW\nand surjective as well. Now we show that it is injective. Suppose\nP(F, H)\u2212modules\nP\nj\n( ni=0 ai H i )( m\nj=0 bj (2\u03b7(E)F + u(H + 1)) ) = 0 with bm 6= 0. Then we have\nPn\n( i=0 ai H i )bm (2\u03b7(E))m F m + g(H, F ) = 0, where the F \u2212degree of g is less than\nm by direct computations.\nBut H i F j are part of the basis of R(H, F ) as a vector\nPn\ni\nspace, hence i=0 an H = 0. Thus, the theorem has been proved.\n\u2737\nLet Y\u03b7 be the left R\u2212module defined by Y\u03b7 = R\u2297C\u03b7 where C\u03b7 is the 1\u2212dimensional\nR(E)\u2212module defined by \u03b7. It is easy to see that Y\u03b7 = R/RR\u03b7 (E) is a Whittaker\nmodule with a cyclic vector 1\u03b7 = 1 \u2297 1. And we have a quotient map\nR \u2212\u2192 Y\u03b7\nIf u \u2208 R, then u\u03b7 is the unique element in R(F, H) such that u1\u03b7 = u\u03b7 1\u03b7 . As in\n[5], we define the \u03b7\u2212reduced action of R(E) on R(F, H) such that R(F, H) is an\nR(E) module in the following way:\nx \u2022 v = (xv)\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7(x)v\nwhere x \u2208 R(E), v \u2208 R(F, H).\nLemma 2.3. Let u \u2208 R(F, H) and x \u2208 R(E), then we have\nx \u2022 u\u03b7 = [x, u]\u03b7\nProof: [x, u]1\u03b7 = (xu \u2212 ux)1\u03b7 = (xu \u2212 \u03b7(x)u)1\u03b7 . Hence\n[x, u]\u03b7 = (xu)\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7(x)u\u03b7 = (xu\u03b7 )\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7(x)u\u03b7 = x \u2022 u\u03b7\n.\n\n\u2737\n\nLemma 2.4. Let x \u2208 R(E), u \u2208 R(F, H), and v \u2208 W (E, F ), then we have\nx \u2022 (uv) = (x \u2022 u)v.\nProof: Let v = w\u03b7 for some w \u2208 Z(R), then uv = uw\u03b7 = u\u03b7 w\u03b7 = (uw)\u03b7 . Thus\nx \u2022 (uv) = x \u2022 (uw)\u03b7 = [x, uw]\u03b7 = ([x, u]w)\u03b7 = [x, u]\u03b7 w\u03b7 = [x, u]v = (x \u2022 u\u03b7 )v =\n(x \u2022 u)v.\n\u2737\nLet V be an R\u2212module and RV be the annihilator of V in R. Then RV defines\na central ideal ZV \u2282 Z by setting ZV = RV \u2229 Z. Suppose that V is a Whittaker\nmodule with a cyclic Whittaker vector w, we denote by Rw the annihilator of w in\nR. It is obvious that RR\u03b7 (E) + RZV \u2282 Rw . In the next theorem, we show that\nthe reversed inclusion holds.\nFirst of all, we need a lemma:\nLemma 2.5. Let X = {v \u2208 R(F, H) | (x \u2022 v)w = 0, x \u2208 R(E)}. Then\nX = (\u00c3 \u2297 WV (F, H)) + W (F, H)\nwhere WV (F, H) = (ZV )\u03b7 . In fact, Rv (F, H) \u2282 X and\nRw (F, H) = \u00c3 \u2297 WV (F, H)\nwhere Rw (F, H) = Rw \u2229 R(F, H).\n\n\f6\n\nXIN TANG\n\nProof: Let us denote by Y = \u00c3 \u2297 WV (F, H) + W (F, H). Thus we need to verify\nX = Y . Let v \u2208 W (F, H), then v = u\u03b7 for some u \u2208 Z(R). So x \u2022 v = x \u2022 u\u03b7 =\n(xu\u03b7 )\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7(x)u\u03b7 = (x\u03b7 u\u03b7 )\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7(x)u\u03b7 = ((xu)\u03b7 )\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7(x)u\u03b7 = (xu)\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7(x)u\u03b7 =\nx\u03b7 u\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7(x)u\u03b7 = 0. So W (F, H) \u2282 X. Let u \u2208 ZV and v \u2208 R(F, H), then for any\nx \u2208 R(E) we have x \u2022 (vu\u03b7 ) = (x \u2022 v)u\u03b7 . Since u \u2208 ZV , then u\u03b7 \u2208 Rw . Thus we\nhave vu\u03b7 \u2208 X, hence \u00c3 \u2297 RV (F, H) \u2282 X. This proves Y \u2282 X. Let \u00c3i be the one\n \u0304 H) be the complement\ndimensional subspace of R(H) spanned by H i and WV (F,\n \u0304 H), then we have the following:\nof WV (F, H) in W (F, H). Set Mi = \u00c3i \u2297 WV (F,\nR(F, H) = M \u2295 Y\n\nP\nwhere M = i\u22651 Mi . We show that M \u2229X = 0. Let M[k] = 1\u2264i\u2264k Mi , then M[k]\nare a filtration of M . Suppose k is the smallest integer such that X \u2229 M[k] 6= 0 and\nP\n \u0304 H). Now we\n0 6= y \u2208 X \u2229M[k] . Then we have y = 1\u2264i\u2264k yi where yi \u2208 \u00c3i \u2297 WV (F,\n \u0303 \u2297 WV (F, H) for i \u2265 1. Hence we have E \u2022 y \u2208 M[k\u22121] . This\nhave 0 6= E \u2022 yi \u2208 Ai\u22121\nis a contradiction. So we have X \u2229 M = 0. Now we prove that Rw (F, H) \u2282 X. Let\nu \u2208 Rw (F, H) and x \u2208 R(E), then we have xuw = 0 and uxw = \u03b7xuw = 0. Thus\n[x, u] \u2208 Rw (F, H), hence [x, u]\u03b7 \u2208 Rw (F, H). Since u \u2208 Rw (F, H) \u2282 Rw (E, F, H),\nthen x \u2022 u = [x, u]\u03b7 . Thus x \u2022 u \u2208 Rw (F, H). So u \u2208 X by the definition of X. Now\nwe prove the following:\nP\n\nW (F, H) \u2229 Rw (F, H) = WV (F, H)\nIn fact, WV (F, H) = (ZV\u03b7 ) and WV (F, H) \u2282 Rw (F, H). So if v \u2208 Ww (F, H) \u2229\nRw (F, H), then we can uniquely write v = u\u03b7 for u \u2208 Z(R). Then vw = 0 implies\nuw = 0 and hence u \u2208 Z(R) \u2229 Rw (F, H). Since V is generated cyclically by w, we\nhave proved the above statement.\nObviously, we have R(E, F, H)ZV \u2282 Rw (E, F, H). Thus we have \u00c3\u2297WV (F, H) \u2282\nRw (F, H), hence we have Rw (F, H) = \u00c3 \u2297 WV (F, H).\n\u2737\nTheorem 2.2. Let V be a Whittaker module admitting a cyclic Whittaker vector\nw, then we have\nRw = RZV + RR\u03b7 (E).\nProof: It is obvious that RZV + RR\u03b7 (E) \u2282 Rw (E, F, H). Let u \u2208 Rw (E, F, H),\nwe show that u \u2208 R(E, F, H)ZV + R(E, F, H)R\u03b7 (E). Let v = u\u03b7 , then it suffices\nto show that v \u2208 \u00c3 \u2297 WV (F, H). But v \u2208 Rw (F, H) = \u00c3 \u2297 WV (F, H).\n\u2737\nTheorem 2.3. Let V be any Whittaker module for R, then the correspondence\nV \u2212\u2192 ZV\nsets up a bijection between the set of all equivalence classes of Whittaker modules\nand the set of ideals of Z(R).\nProof: Let Vi , i = 1, 2 be two Whittaker modules. If ZV1 = ZV2 , then clearly V1\nis equivlent to V2 by the above Theorem. Now let Z\u2217 be an ideal of Z(R) and let\nL = RZ\u2217 +RR\u03b7 (E). Then V = R/L is a Whittaker module with a cyclic Whittaker\nvector w = 1\u0304. Obviously, we have Rw = L. So that L = Rw = RZV +RR\u03b7 (E). This\nimplies that \u03b7(L) = (Z\u2217 )\u03b7 = \u03b7(Rw ) = (ZV )\u03b7 . Since \u03b7 is injective, thus ZV = Z\u2217 .\nHence we have completed the proof.\n\u2737\nTheorem 2.4. Let V be an R\u2212module. Then V is a Whittaker module if and only\nif\nV \u223c\n= R \u2297Z\u2297R(E) (Z/Z\u2217 )\u03b7\n\n\fWHITTAKER MODEL OF R(f )\n\n7\n\nIn particular, in such a case the ideal Z\u2217 is uniquely determined to be ZV .\nProof: If 1\u2217 is the image of 1 in Z/Z\u2217 , then AnnZ(R)\u2297R(F ) (1\u2217 ) = R(E)Z\u2217 +\nZ(R)R\u03b7 (E). The annihilator of w = 1\u22971\u2217 is Rw = R(E, F, H)Z\u2217 +R(E, F, H)R\u03b7 (E).\nThen the result follows from the last theorem.\n\u2737\nTheorem 2.5. Let V be an R\u2212module with a cyclic Whittaker vector w \u2208 V . Then\nany v \u2208 V is a Whittaker vector if and only if v = uw for some w \u2208 Z(R).\nProof: If v = uw for some u \u2208 Z(R), then obviously that v is a Whittaker\nvector. Now let v = uw for some u \u2208 R be a Whittaker vector of V . Then v = u\u03b7 w\nby the definition of Whittaker module. So that we can assume that u \u2208 R(F, H).\nIf x \u2208 R(E), we have xuw = \u03b7(x)uw and uxw = \u03b7(x)uw. Thus we have [x, u]w = 0\nand hence [x, u]\u03b7 w = 0. But we have x \u2022 u = [x.u]\u03b7 . Thus we have u \u2208 X. We can\nnow write u = u1 + u2 where u1 \u2208 R(F, H), and u2 \u2208 W (F, H). Then u1 w = 0.\nThus u2 w = v. But now u2 = u\u03b73 where u3 \u2208 Z(R). So we have v = u3 w, which\nproves the theorem.\n\u2737\nNow let V be a Whittaker module and EndR (V ) be the endomorphism ring of\nV as an R\u2212module. Then we can define the following homomorphism of algebras\ndefined by the action of Z(R) on V :\n\u03c0V : Z \u2212\u2192 EndR (V )\nIt is clear that Z(R)/ZV (R) = \u03c0V (Z(R)) \u2282 EndR (V ). In fact the next theorem\nsays that this inclusion is equal as well.\nTheorem 2.6. Assume that V is a whittaker module. Then EndR (V ) \u223c\n= Z/ZV .\nIn particular EndR (V ) is commutative.\nProof: Let w \u2208 V be a cyclic Whittaker vector. If \u03b1 \u2208 EndR (V ), then we have\n\u03b1(w) = uw for some u \u2208 Z(R) by the above Theorem. Thus we have \u03b1(vw) =\nvuw = uvw = u\u03b1(w). Hence \u03b1 = \u03c0V (u), which proves the theorem.\n\u2737\nNow we are going to construct some Whittaker modules. Let \u03be : Z(R) \u2212\u2192 C be\na central character. For any given central character \u03be, Z\u03be = Ker(\u03be) \u2282 Z(R) is a\nmaximal ideal of Z(R). Since C is an algebraically closed field, then Z\u03be = (\u03a9 \u2212 a\u03be ).\nGiven any central character \u03be, let C\u03be,\u03b7 be the one dimensional Z \u2297 R(E)\u2212module\ndefined by uvy = \u03be(u)\u03b7(v)y for any u \u2208 Z and v \u2208 R(E). Let\nY\u03be,\u03b7 = R(E, F, H) \u2297Z\u2297R(E) C\u03be,\u03b7\nIt is easy to see that Y\u03be,\u03b7 is a Whittaker module of type \u03b7 and admits an infinitesimal\ncentral character \u03be. Since R is almost commutative, so by Quillen's lemma, we know\nevery irreducible representation has an infinitesimal central character. As studied\nin [13], we know R has a similar Verma module theory. In fact, Verma modules also\nfall into the category of Whittaker modules if we allow the trivial central character\non R(E). Namely, we have\nM\u03bb = R \u2297R(E,H) C\u03bb\nwhere R(H) acts on C\u03bb through \u03bb and R(E) acts trivially on C\u03bb . M\u03bb admits an\ninfinitesimal character with \u03be = \u03be(\u03bb). It is well-known that Verma modules may not\nbe necessarily irreducible, even though they have infinitesimal central characters.\nWhile Whittaker modules are on the othe extreme as shown in the next theorem:\n\n\f8\n\nXIN TANG\n\nTheorem 2.7. Let V be a Whittaker module for R. Then the following conditions\nare equivalent.\n(1) V is irreducible.\n(2) V admits a central character.\n(3) ZV is a maximal ideal.\n(4) The space of Whittaker vectors of V is one-dimensional.\n(5) All nonzero Whittaker vectors of V are cyclic.\n(6) The centrializer EndR (V ) is reduced to the constants C.\n(7) V is isomorphic to Y\u03be,\u03b7 for some central character \u03be.\nProof: It is easy to see that (2) \u2212 (7) are equivalent to each other by using the\nabove theorems we have just proved. We also know (1) implies (2). To complete\nthe proof, it suffices to show that (4) implies irreducibility. To this true, we show\nthat any submodule V \u2032 of V contains a nonzero Whittaker vector, which closes the\nproof. Let v \u2208 V , we recall that the reduced \u03b7\u2212action is defined as follows:\nx \u2022 v = xv \u2212 \u03b7(x)v\nfor any x \u2208 R(E, F, H). If u \u2208 R and x \u2208 R(E), then we have x \u2022 (uv) =\nxuv \u2212 \u03b7(x)uv = [x, u]v + uxv \u2212 \u03b7(x)uv. Since uxv = \u03b7(x)uv, thus we have the\nfollowing:\nx \u2022 (uv) = [x, u]v\nNow let\nR(E, F, H) \u2212\u2192 V\nbe the morphism from R(E, F, H) into V by mapping u \u2208 R to u \u2022 w. Then this\nmap is a homomorphism of the R(E)\u2212module R under the adjoint action of R(E)\ninto the R(E)\u2212module V under \u03b7\u2212reduced action. Note the adjoint actin of R(E)\non R is locally finite. Let 0 6= v \u2208 V \u2032 and write v = uw for u \u2208 R. Let R0 be\nthe R(E)\u2212submodule of R generated by u. Then the submodule R0 \u2282 R is finite\ndimensional. Thus the image V0 of R0 inside V is finite dimensional. And R(E) is\nthe enveloping algebra of the one dimensional Lie algebra generated by E, which\nacts nilpotently on V0 via the reduced action. Since we have v \u2208 V0 , then V0 \u2282 V \u2032 .\nSo by Engel's Theorem, we have x \u2022 v0 = 0 for some 0 6= v0 \u2208 V0 for all x \u2208 R(E).\nSo v0 is a Whittaker vector.\n\u2737\nIt is easy to prove the following theorems, we refer the reader to [5] for details\nabout their proofs:\nTheorem 2.8. Let V be an R\u2212module which admits an infinitesimal characater.\nAssume that w \u2208 V is a Whittaker vector. Then the submodule Rw \u2282 V is irreducible.\n\u2737\nTheorem 2.9. Let V1 , V2 be any two irreducble R\u2212modules with the same infinitesimal character. If V1 and V2 contain Whittaker vectors, then these vectors are\n\n\fWHITTAKER MODEL OF R(f )\n\n9\n\nuniquge up to scalars. Furthermore, V1 and V2 are isomorphic to each other as\nR\u2212modules.\n\u2737\nIn fact, we have the following description about the basis of any irreducible\nWhittaker module (V, w), where w \u2208 V is a cyclic Whittaker vector.\nTheorem 2.10. Let (V, w) be an irreducible Whittaker module with a Whittaker\nvector w, then V has a C\u2212vector space basis consisting of elements {H i w | i \u2265 0}.\nProof: Since w is a cyclic Whittaker vector of the Whittaker module (V, w),\nthen we have V = Rw. Since R = R(F, H) \u2297R(E) C\u03b7 , then we have V = R(F, H)w.\nSince (V, w) is irreducible, then (V, w) has a central infinitesimal character. Thus\nwe have \u03a9w = \u03bb(\u03a9)w. Now \u03a9w = (2\u03b7(E)F + u(H + 1))w. Hence the action of F\non (V, w) is uniquely determined by the action of H on (V, w). Thus the theorem\nfollows.\n\u2737\n3. The submodule structure of a Whittaker module (V, w)\nIn this section, we spell out the details about the structure of submodules of a\nWhittaker module (V, w). We have a clean description of all submodules through\nthe geometry of the affine line A1 . Throughout this section, we will fix a Whittaker\nmodule V of type \u03b7 and a cyclic Whittaker vector w of V . Our arguement is more\nor less the same as the one in [11].\nLemma 3.1. Let Z(R) = C[\u03a9] be the center of R, then any maximal ideal of Z(R)\nis of the form (\u03a9 \u2212 a) for some a \u2208 C.\nProof: This fact follows from the assumption that C is algebraically closed\nfield and Hilbert Nullstenllenzuts Theorem.\n\u2737\nLet ZV be the annihilator of V Q\nin Z(R), then ZV = (f (\u03a9)) for some polynomial\nf (\u03a9) \u2208 Z(R). Suppose that f = i=1,2,*** ,m fini for some irreducible polynomials\nfi . Then we have the following:\nQ\nn\nProposition 3.1. Vi = R j6=i fj j w are indecomposable submodules of V . In\nparticular, we have\nV = V1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Vm\nas a direct sum of submodules.\nProof: It is easy to verify that Vi are submodules. Now we show each Vi\nis indecomposible. Suppose not, we can assume without loss of generality that\nV1 = W1 \u2295W2 . Note that ZV = ZW1 \u2229ZW2 . Since Z(R) is a principal ideal domain,\nhence ZWi = (gi (\u03a9). Thus we have gi | f1n1 . This implies that the decomposition is\nnot a direct sum. Therefore, Vi are all indecomposable. The decomposition follows\nfrom the Chinese Reminder Theorem.\n\u2737\nProposition 3.2. Let (V, w) be a Whittaker module and ZV =< f n > where f is\nan irreducible polynomial in C[\u03a9]. Let Vi = Rf i w, i = 0, * * * n and Si = Vi /Vi+1 , i =\n0, * * * , n \u2212 1. Then Si , i = 0, * * * , n \u2212 1 are irreducible Whittaker modules of the\nsame type \u03b7 and form a composition series of V . In particular, V is of finite length.\nProof: The proof follows from the fact that ZSi =< f i > for all i.\n\n\u2737\n\n\f10\n\nXIN TANG\n\nRemark 3.1. V being of finite length is an analogue of the classical situation. In\ndeed, in the classical case, Whittaker modules of U (g) are mapped to holonomic\nD\u2212modules on the flag variety of g by the Beilinson-Bernstein localization ([2]),\nand therefore are of finite length ([9] and [10]).\nWith the same assumption, we have the following\nCorollary 3.1. V has a unique maximal submodule V1 .\nProof: This is obvious, since the only maximal ideal of ZV is < f >.\n\u2737\nBased on the above propositions, the irreducibility and indecomposibility are\nreduced to the investigation of ZV . One has that V is irreducible if and only if ZV\nis a maximal ideal. And V is indecomposible if and only if ZV is primary. The\nfollowing proposition is just a refinement of the submodule struture of (V, w).\nProposition 3.3. Suppose (V, w) is an indecomposible Whittaker module with\nZV =< f n >, then any submodule V \u2032 \u2282 V is of the form:\nV \u2032 = Rf i w\nfor some i \u2208 {0, * * * , n}.\n\u2737\nNow we are going to investigate the submodule structure of any Whittaker module (V, w) with a nontrivial central annihilator ZV . First of all, we recall some\nnotations from [5]. Let V \u2032 \u2282 V be any submodule of V , we define an ideal of Z as\nfollows:\nZ(V \u2032 ) = {x \u2208 Z | xV \u2032 \u2282 V \u2032 }\nWe may call Z(V \u2032 ) the normalizer of V \u2032 in Z. Conversely, for any ideal J \u2282 Z\ncontaining ZV , JV \u2282 V is a submodule of V .\nTheorem 3.1. Let (V, w) be a Whittaker module with ZV 6= 0. Then there is a\none-to-one correspondence between the set of all submodules of V and the set of all\nideals of Z containing ZV given by the maps V \u2032 \u2212\u2192 Z(V \u2032 ) and J \u2212\u2192 JV . These\nmaps are inverse to each other.\nProof: The proof is straightforward.\n\u2737\nNow we have a description of the basis of any Whittaker module (V, w) as follows.\nProposition 3.4. Let (V, w) be a Whittaker module and suppose that ZV =<\nf (\u03a9) > where f 6= 0 is a monic polynomial of degree n. Then B = {F i H j w | 0 6=\ni \u2264 n \u2212 1, j \u2208 Z\u22650 } is a basis of (V, w).
