The large interest for this issue relies mainly on the fact\nthat entangled systems can be used to perform some tasks more efficiently than classical objects [1]. It is then natural\nto look for a good understanding of this resource not only from a purely mathematical point of view, i.e., formalizing\nthe theory of entanglement, but also from a more practical approach, i.e., studying its role and manifestations in\nrealistic systems. For example, recent works have been able to connect entanglement to thermodynamical properties\nof macroscopic physical systems [2]. In a distinct venue, other works study physical manifestations of quantum\ncorrelations by suitably choosing particular purity and entanglement quantifiers and restricting allowed quantum\nstates according to these quantities [3]. In these studies, concepts like maximally entangled mixed states (MEMS)\nare discussed. A very recent study also adds energy to entanglement and purity as a third parameter to characterize\ncertain quantum states [4]. In particular, the authors discuss the physically allowed states according to the possible\nvalues of entanglement, purity and energy for a system composed of two qubits or two gaussian states, and also study\nthe entanglement transfer between them.\nIn the present manuscript, we study the connection between entanglement and energy that appears naturally in\na swapping process involving two systems of two qubits. In the model investigated, we consider a simple form of\ninteraction between two pairs of qubits labeled as aA and bB. The system ab is prepared in an entangled state while\nthe pair AB is prepared in a factorable state. We analyze the dynamical relations between energy and entanglement\nof qubits AB when exchanging energy and coherence with qubits ab. In particular, for any given time t, we calculate\nthe full quantum state of qubits abAB and then we trace out qubits ab to calculate energy and entanglement of the\nremaining pair AB. We show that this dynamics yields paths in an entanglement-energy diagram, and that these\npaths are contained in a very restricted region. Moreover, we identify the frontiers of this region from the general form\nof the density operator that represents the state of the subsystem AB. We also propose a physical system to realize\nsuch entanglement transfer and investigate how the dynamics of the entanglement swapping is modified if the AB\nsystem is open and allowed to dissipate energy to an external reservoir. In some sense, this work is complementary to\nthe sequence [5] in which the authors study the problem of entanglement transfer from continuous-variable entangled\nstates to qubits, although in those works the authors do not pay particular attention to the relation between Energy\nand Entanglement.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II we introduce the general physical system that we will study and\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: msantos@fisica.ufmg.br\n\n\f2\nthe basic setup from which we will approach it. We also define the quantities that will be analyzed throughout the\npaper and finally we discuss the dynamics of this system. Section III is devoted to study the entanglement and the\nenergy of system AB under a particular unitary evolution. We then propose a physical implementation for the studied\nHamiltonian, and generalize the time evolution in section IV by considering the problem of a dissipative, non-unitary\nevolution. In section V we conclude by reviewing the main points we have discussed and suggesting possible extensions\nof this study.\nII.\n\nPHYSICAL SCENARIO\n\nLet us start by describing the system we are interested in. Suppose a system of four qubits a, b, A, and B interacting\nvia a spin-exchange like Hamiltonian:\nH = HaA + HbB ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nHaA =\n\n~\u03c9a a ~\u03c9A A\na A\na A\n\u03c3 +\n\u03c3 + gaA (\u03c3\u2212\n\u03c3+ + \u03c3+\n\u03c3\u2212 )\n2 z\n2 z\n\n(2a)\n\nHbB =\n\n~\u03c9b b ~\u03c9B B\nb B\nb B\n\u03c3 +\n\u03c3 + gbB (\u03c3\u2212\n\u03c3+ + \u03c3+\n\u03c3\u2212 ).\n2 z\n2 z\n\n(2b)\n\nand\n\nFor each qubit, the relevant Pauli operators are defined by\n\u03c3z = |1i h1| \u2212 |0i h0| ,\n\u03c3+ = |1i h0| ,\n\u03c3\u2212 = |0i h1| ,\n\n(3a)\n(3b)\n(3c)\n\na A\nand the interaction operators like \u03c3\u2212\n\u03c3+ , for example, can be viewed as annihilating an excitation of subsystem a and\ncreating an excitation in subsystem A. The constants gaA and gbB give the strength of the interaction between these\nsubsystems. One important feature in understanding such Hamiltonians is that the total number of excitations is a\naA\nconserved quantity. The eigenvectors of (2a) (similarly to (2b)) are\neigenvalue E00\n= \u2212~\u03c9,\n\u221a given by: |00iaA , with\naA\naA\n|11iaA , with eigenvalue E11 = ~\u03c9, and |\u039b\u00b1 iaA = (|01i \u00b1 |10i)/ 2, with eigenvalue E\u00b1 = \u00b1~gaA /2, where \u03c9 =\n(\u03c9a + \u03c9A )/2.\nAs the initial state, let us suppose that the entire abAB system is prepared in the form:\n\n|\u03c6(t = 0)i = |\u03c8(\u03b8)iab \u2297 |00iAB .\n\n(4)\n\nwhere |\u03c8(\u03b8)iab = sin \u03b8 |01i + cos \u03b8 |10i, which means that subsystem AB is prepared in its ground state and subsystem\nab is usually prepared in some entangled state with one excitation (except if \u03b8 = n \u03c02 , n \u2208 Z, when the state is\nfactorable). Note that this initial state is pure and it is chosen so that the bipartition ab \u2297 AB does not present\nany initial entanglement. From now on, we will study the time evolution of this initial state when subjected to\nHamiltonian (1) for different coupling constants gaA and gbB . We will concentrate our analysis in the subsystem AB\nby tracing out the degrees of freedom of systems a and b. Another simplifying assumption we made is to consider the\ncomplete resonance condition \u03c9a = \u03c9A = \u03c9b = \u03c9B = \u03c9.\nA special case of this dynamics happens when gaA = gbB = g, in which case state (4) evolves into state\n|\u03c6(t)i = cos(gt) |\u03c8iab \u2297 |00iAB \u2212 i sin(gt) |00iab \u2297 |\u03c8iAB .\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c0\n, with n odd, the subsystems exchange their states, the entanglement initially\nNote that in this simple case, for t = n 2g\npresent in subsystem ab is completely transferred to subsystem AB and with respect to the bipartition ab \u2297 AB the\n\u03c0\nstate becomes again separable. However, for t 6= n 2g\n, the whole system is entangled (as long as \u03b8 6= n \u03c02 ) and subsystem\nAB will be in some mixed state.\nIn a more general situation (different coupling constants), state (4) will evolve into:\n\n|\u03c6(t)i = cos \u03b8[cos(gaA t) |1000i \u2212 i sin(gaA t) |0010i]\n+ sin \u03b8[cos(gbB t) |0100i \u2212 i sin(gbB t) |0001i].\n\n(6)\n\n\f3\nNote that for generic times t, state (6) presents, again, multipartite entanglement among all its individual components\n(a, b, A and B). Studying this multipartite entanglement may also prove intriguing and enlightening. However this\nis not the purpose of this manuscript where, as mentioned above, we will concentrate our analysis in the subsystem\nAB.\nOur goal is to investigate the relation between energy and entanglement in subsystem AB as a function of coupling\nconstants and time. In order to study entanglement we will use the negativity (N ) which can be defined for two qubits\nas two times the modulus of the negative eigenvalue of the partial transposition of the state \u03c1, \u03c1TA [6], if it exists.\nFor short:\nN (\u03c1) = 2 max{0, \u2212\u03bbmin },\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03bbmin is the lowest eigenvalue of \u03c1TA . Our choice is motivated by the facts that the Negativity is easy to\ncalculate and provides full entanglement information for a two-qubit system. For the energy of subsystem AB, U , we\nwill consider the mean value of the relevant restriction of the free Hamiltonian:\nU = Tr {\u03c1HAB } ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\nHAB =\n\nIII.\n\n\u0001\n~\u03c9 A\n\u03c3z + \u03c3zB .\n2\n\n(9)\n\nENTANGLEMENT AND ENERGY\n\nAfter tracing out the degrees of freedom of systems a and b in the global quantum state (6), the reduced state for\nthe pair AB is described by:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\na 0 0 0\n\uf8ec0 b d 0\uf8f7\n,\n(10)\n\u03c1AB = \uf8ed\n0 d\u2217 c 0 \uf8f8\n0 0 0 0\nwhere a + b + c = 1 (from the normalization of \u03c1AB ), with a, b, c and d given by the following functions of the coupling\nconstants and time:\na\nb\nc\nd\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\ncos2 \u03b8 cos2 (gaA t) + sin2 \u03b8 cos2 (gbB t),\nsin2 \u03b8 sin2 (gbB t),\ncos2 \u03b8 sin2 (gaA t),\ncos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 sin(gaA t) sin(gbB t).\n\n(11a)\n(11b)\n(11c)\n(11d)\n\nFollowing Eq. (8), the energy of state (10) is:\nU = \u2212a,\n\n(12)\n\nU = \u2212 cos2 \u03b8 cos2 (gaA t) \u2212 sin2 \u03b8 cos2 (gbB t).\n\n(13)\n\nwhich, by means of Eqs. (11), becomes:\n\nNote that \u22121 \u2264 U \u2264 0, which means that there is at most one excitation on the AB system. This is expected since\nthe chosen initial state contains only one excitation for the entire abAB system and this set of qubits is isolated, i.e.\nit cannot be excited by external sources.

(10) versus time. The initial state is given by\nEq. (4) with \u03b8 = \u03c0/4, which means a maximally entangled pair ab is initially present, and its entanglement can be transferred\nto the pair AB. Several values of m and n were used in the relation mgaA = ngbB .\n\nconstants gaA = gbB , in which the state |\u03c8i is cyclically \"bouncing\" between the two pairs of qubits. The chosen ratios\nbetween coupling constants indicate a very important behavior of the system: the complete entanglement transferring\nprocess can only happen if mgaA = ngbB for m and n odd integers. Eq. (11a) supports this conclusion, since both gaA t\nand gbB t must be odd multiples of \u03c02 simultaneously (remember that cos2 \u03b8 and sin2 \u03b8 are positive numbers in order to\nthe state |\u03c8 (\u03b8)i to be entangled). The physical picture is that each pair aA and bB oscillates inside duplets |10i and\n|01i. The situation is analogous to two classical harmonic oscillators with distinct frequencies starting from a common\nextremal point. The implied relation is necessary for them to meet within an odd number of half oscillations, which\n\u03c0\nis the condition for a complete transfer of state. To insist in this point, note that for gaA = 2gbB , at time t = gaA\n,\nthe pair aA (or, more precisely, its analogous oscillator) has suffered a full oscillation, but the pair bB (resp. its\n\n\f5\nanalogous oscillator) has undergone half an oscillation, so one could found entanglement between a and B, but no\nentanglement can be found between any other pair of qubits, including the studied pair AB.\nFor other values of \u03b8 we obtain similar pictures, with the only important difference in the entanglement scale, since\nno maximally entangled pair will be formed.\nB.\n\nEntanglement versus energy\n\nIn this subsection we use time as a parameter to draw graphics on an entanglement versus energy diagram.

Hence, the situation here studied models an experiment where previously\nentangled atoms transfer such entanglement to independent cavity modes. One nice point when considering this\nparticular situation of atoms transferring entanglement and energy to resonant cavities is that those systems can have\nvery different dissipation times. In fact, atomic levels can be selected so that their dissipation time scale is much\nlarger than those of typical resonant cavities. In this case, one can ask what happens if the system that receives\nthe energy and the entanglement dissipates it to an external reservoir. In order to answer this question, the unitary\nanalysis considered up to now has to be abandoned and we must change from a Hamiltonian approach to a master\nequation one.\nWe will consider that the qubits AB, now represented by the cavity field modes, are in contact with independent\nreservoirs and interact with them. Since atomic lifetimes (for the atomic transitions used in cavity QED experiments)\nare usually much greater than cavity decay times, we will not couple the lower case qubits to any external device.\nTo address this problem we consider the time evolution of the global system described by the master equation in\nthe Lindblad form [8]:\n\u0003\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003\u0011\nd\n1 X\u0010\u0002\n1\u0002\nH, \u03c1aAbB (t) +\nV\u0302i \u03c1aAbB (t), V\u0302i\u2020 + V\u0302i , \u03c1aAbB (t)V\u0302i\u2020 ,\n\u03c1aAbB (t) =\ndt\ni~\n2~ i\n\n(22)\n\nwhere H is given by (1) and the operators V\u0302i and V\u0302i\u2020 describe the effects of the coupling to the reservoirs.

Also note that energy and negativity are still respectively described by\nequations of the forms (12) and (14). In Fig. 5 we have plotted some curves of negativity and energy vs. time, for the\nsystem AB considering the temporal evolution of the matrix elements given by Eq. (24). Note that the graphics are\nqualitatively similar to the ones displayed in Fig. 1 for unitary evolutions. However, as expected, both entanglement\nand energy decay exponentially to their lowest values as a function of time. This can be understood from the fact\nthat the environment drives the system exponentially to the state |00i (see the matrix elements in Eq. (24) - the\nelement (24a) goes to unity while all the others go to zero), which has no entanglement and has the minimum energy\nvalue U = \u22121.\nWe have also plotted the negativity vs. energy for the non-unitary case for different values of gaA , gbB , \u03baaA and\n\u03babB . This is displayed in Fig. 6. As commented before the followed paths are still bounded by the same limits of\nthe unitary case. However, as the dissipative mechanisms get stronger (i.e. coefficients \u03baA and \u03baB get closer to the\ncoupling constants gaA and gbB ), less and less entanglement is transferred to subsystem \u03c1AB .\nA different phenomenology can be anticipated for the case of non-null temperature. Since thermal photons can\nnow be captured by both cavities, the state |11i will be populated and the form (10) will not be valid anymore. One\nconsequence is that one can expect the phenomenon known as entanglement sudden death [9], since it will not be\nnecessary to nullify the elements d in order to have a positive partial transpose, and hence no entanglement.\nV.\n\nDISCUSSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have addressed the problem of entanglement and energy transfer between pairs of qubits. We\nconsidered the particular example of two atoms interacting with two cavities in the Jaynes-Cummings model. This\nevolution can be seen as a state transferring process and, for specific coupling constants, a dynamical entanglement\nswapping. If the atoms are initially in an entangled state, this entanglement is fully or partially transferred to the\ncavities depending on coupling constants and time. This entanglement swapping process is accompanied by an energy\ntransfer as well, and we have shown that entanglement and energy in the cavities system are strictly related.\nTo clarify this relation we studied these quantities in various scenarios. First we considered the whole system as\nisolated, and investigated its time evolution for several coupling constants and different initial atomic entanglement.\nIn each case, we traced out the atoms (as we now refer to the lower case qubits), we drew an entanglement vs. energy\nphase-diagram for the cavity modes and we found an upper-limit for all the possible paths in these diagrams. This\nbound corresponds to maximally entangled atoms transferring its entanglement and energy to independent cavities\nat exactly the same rates.\nWe also considered the possibility of dissipation in the cavities. In this case, while the atoms are transferring excitations and entanglement to the cavities, some energy is lost to the environment. The cavities state goes asymptotically\nto state |00i. In the dissipative regime, the evolution of entanglement and energy of the cavities state exhibits the\nsame characteristics pointed out for the unitary case, i.e., the paths followed in the entanglement-energy diagram are\nlimited to a restricted region whose frontier is identified by the trajectory described when the couplings are identical\n\n\f9\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n2\n\n0.2\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nt\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n0\n\n4\n\n6\n\nt\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n0\n\u20130.2\n\n\u20130.2\n\u20130.4\n\u20130.4\n\u20130.6\n\n\u20130.6\n\u20130.8\n\n\u20130.8\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20131\n\nU\nN\n\nU\nN\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nt\n\n8\n\n0\n\n10\n\n12\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nt\n\n0\n\n\u20130.2\n\n\u20130.2\n\n\u20130.4\n\n\u20130.4\n\n\u20130.6\n\n\u20130.6\n\n\u20130.8\n\n\u20130.8\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20131\n\nU\nN\n\nU\nN\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Energy U (red) and Negativity N (blue) of the cavity modes state (10) with matrix elements given\nby Eq.

However,\nmost of the time the whole system presents multipartite entanglement which may provide interesting new results if\nfurther studied. Other important continuations of this work include the treatment of non-completely resonant systems\n(e.g.\u03c9a = \u03c9A 6= \u03c9b = \u03c9B , which corresponds to two distinct atoms resonantly coupled to cavity modes, as well as\nthe case of dispersive coupling) and also other couplings to reservoirs, like including temperature in the scenario here\npresented and also considering spontaneous decay for the atoms.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors recognize fruitful discussions with M.C.
