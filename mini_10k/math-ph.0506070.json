Our (writing) efforts are justified by the high interest for physics and mathematics of\nc d\nthe space V; indeed there exist an infinity of such representations, a countable subset of explicit examples\nbeing provided by integrable representations of infinite dimensional affine algebras, (\"Kac-Moody\" algebras)\nand Virasoro algebra representations called \"minimal models\". Any of the rational conformal field theories\n( whenever their classification will be achieved) will provide such a representation.\nIn the following paragraphs we look at subgroups or quotients of SL2(Z) expressing elements in terms\nof words in the two generators T and S. Physical motivation for this is that T is represented by a unitary\ndiagonal matrix whose eigenvalues are related to the physical dimension of fundamental excitations, whereas\nS describes the effect of putting a box on one of its sides, or permuting the role of \"space\" and \"time\" in\nsome hamiltonian description.\nSince this field of research is very popular, we refer the reader to monographies (like the one by J.M.\nDrouffe and C. Itzykson) and go directly into:\nPreliminary formulae:\nThe best to get acquainted with beauties of matrix groups over rings is maybe to let oneself play;\ntherefore let us consider products of matrices of the form:\nT x S :=\n\nT\n\nxn\n\nS***T\n\nx1\n\nS :=\n\n\u0012\n\nAn\nCn\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n0\n\nx\n1\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nBn\nDn\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n=\n\n0 \u22121\n1 0\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nx\n1\n\nxn An\u22121 \u2212 Cn\u22121\nAn\u22121\n\n\u22121\n0\n\n\u0013\n\nxn Bn\u22121 \u2212 Dn\u22121\nBn\u22121\n\n\u0013\n\nFor arbitrary elements of SL2(Z), we know the minimal n required is not bounded, according to the\nfamous Farey's enumeration of rational numbers between 0 and 1.\n1\n\n\fFor n = 3 we get:\nT x ST \u2212d ST y S =\n\n\u0012\n\nT u ST c ST v =\n\n\u0012\n\nand also\n\nT u ST \u2212c S \u22121 T v\n\n\u2212(xdy + x + y) 1 + xd\n\u2212(dy + 1)\nd\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\nuc \u2212 1 ucv \u2212 u \u2212 v\nc\ncv \u2212 1\n\u0012\n\u0013\nuc + 1 ucv + u + v\n=\nc\ncv + 1\n\nWe will always denote integers with lower case letters: a,b,c,d ; and by A,B,C,D their residues modulo\nN , a fixed integer equal to the order of the matrix \u03c1(T ). Quite often ad \u2212 bc = 1 and when (c, N ) = 1 we\nwill denote by C \u22121 the inverse of C in Z/N Z. In the case (d, n) = 1 we will denote its inverse also by D\u22121 .\nIn the next paragraphs, we will use some formulae valid for elements A, B, C, D satisfying AD\u2212BC \u2261 1\nin a commutative ring.

The\nquestion of which relations can be added in order to obtain a quotient group which is finite, or a triangulated\nsurface of finite genus ( and finite area) naturally arises. Note that for some authors a Riemann surface is\ncompact and this is not the case as long as we keep the hyperbolic metric structure for which the punctures\nare at ( logarithmically ) infinite distance.\nOther questions are: what are the relations which lead to the group SL2(Z/N Z) ?. At given N, what\nare the relations which give a surface of minimal genus?\n\nHere we address only the first question for which we need the following:\nLemma: when BC \u2261 \u22122,\nST\n\nC\n\nST\n\n\u2212B\n\n\u2261T\n\nB\n\nST\n\n\u2212C\n\nS\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2261\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22121 B\nC 1\n\n\u0013\n\nwhen BC \u2261 0,\nST C ST \u2212B \u2261 T \u2212B ST C S \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\nST \u2212C S \u22121 T B \u2261 T B ST \u2212C S \u22121\n\n\u0013\n\u22121 B\nC \u22121\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 B\n\u2261\nC 1\n\nProposition:\nST U ST \u2212A S T V \u2261 T X ST \u2212D S T Y S\n\nIf and only if\n\nA \u2261 \u2212(X + BY ) , D \u2261 \u2212(V + BU ) , U X \u2261 V Y\nwhere necessarily B \u2261 1 + XD \u2261 1 + AV\nProposition: let p be a prime\nIf N = pn > 2 , SL2(Z/N Z)is presented with extra relations:\nHA := T A ST 1/A ST A S \u22121 for invertible A\u2032 s , HA HB = HAB\n2\n\nHA T = T A HA , HA S = S \u22121 H1/A\nProof: define for each (C, D) such that there exist A, B, AD \u2212 BC \u2261 1, a word X(C,D) in S and T which\ncorresponds to both an SL2 matrix and an hyperbolic triangle. We can enumerate elements of the group\nmod N as words of the form T x X(C,D) .\nThen one proves that SL2(Z/N Z)/ \u00b1 1 is generated by relations given above (with S 2 = 1 ) by a\ncareful study of glueing formulae at the boundary of the connected triangulated domain. This is achieved\nby checking by use of the above relations that for each X(C,D) , X(C,D) T \u00b11 and X(C,D) S are of the form\nT L X(C \u2032 ,D\u2032 ) for some L, C \u2032 , D\u2032 \u2208 Z/N Z . That the relations do not give a smaller quotient comes from the\nfact easily checked that the matrix group SL2(Z/N Z) explicitly do satisfy these relations.\nSince it deserves some time, let us give some explicit steps in a constructive proof of the above presentation:\n4\n\n\fX(0,1) = identity.\nX(1,D) = ST D\nFor (c, N ) = 1, 2 \u2264 c \u2264 N2\u22121 and for any D: X(C,D) = ST C ST (D+1)/C . Note that for more general N\none could also take\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u22121 \u2212X\nX(C,D) = ST C ST X \u2261\nwhenever exists X such that CX \u2261 D +1 ; note that this includes\nC\nD\nthe cases X(C,\u22121) = ST C S.\nFor c not coprime with p (thus with N ) , 0 \u2264 c \u2264 N2 and (d, N ) = 1 , 2 \u2264 d \u2264 N 2\u22121 we take\nX(C,D) = ST d ST (1\u2212c)/d S \u22121 .\nWith the same c and (d, N ) = 1 , \u2212 N2 < d \u2264 \u22122\nX(C,D) = ST\n\n\u2212D\n\nST\n\n\u2212(1+C)/D\n\nS\u2261\n\n\u0012\n\n(1 + C)/D\nC\n\n.\n\n1\nD\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1 0\nFinally for C non invertible, 2 \u2264 c < N/2: X(C,1) = ST\nS =\nC 1\nThis presentation by generators and relations being established, a few remarks are useful:\nA dual point of view which is also useful is to construct the surface by glueing N-gons which are collections\nof triangles labelled by words Y(A,C) T z . Then the centers of the corresponding N-gon can be seen as having\ncoordinate \u03c4 = ac on the real axis ( boundary of the upper half plane). A more rigourous formulation is of\ncourse to identify the center of the N-gon to the orbit of ac under homographic \u0393(N ) tranformations.\n\u2212C\n\n\u22121\n\nOf course, the above relations in terms of the HA \u2032 s are redondant, it suffices to have them for generators\nof this abelian group (Cartan torus) isomorphic to the group of invertible residues mod N. Even one can\nfind in literature various relations, which we already collected in a previous electronic text with T. Gannon\n(arXiv/math.QA/9909080 ). According to various authors their relations do in fact imply the above relations.\n(Such implication may come from interesting constructions and from the congruence subgroup property).\nWe give below for small values of N, such simple and compact looking presentations.\nNote the genus of the Riemann surface is\nif N = pn , g = 1 +\n\np3n \u2212 p3n\u22122 \u2212 6p2n + 6p2n\u22122\n24\n\nThe above construction allows us to enumerate explicitly elements of SL2 (Z/N Z), when N is a prime\npower. Of course an explicit use of the chinese remainder theorem gives us a description of the general group\nSL2 (Z/N Z) as direct product of its primary factors.\nLet us give explicitly formulae for the generators in terms of decomposition of 1 (mod N ) into orthogonal\nsum of idempotents: This is textbook result for commutative semisimple algebras, called in french \"alg\u00e8bres\nr\u00e9duites\" by Bourbaki:\n1 \u2261 \u03a3p,\n\np|N\n\ncp mod N\n\nTp := T cp\n\nSp := S 2 (ST 1\u2212cp )3 = S 2 (T 1\u2212cp S)3\nBut a decomposition into primary factors gives a much too complicated description of elements of\nSL2 (Z/N Z) as words in S and T . There is a much smarter approach!:\nProposition:\nAny element of SL2 (Z/N Z) can be written with at most four powers of T , i. e. as a word like:\nT x3 ST x2 ST x1 ST x0\nProof: We start with the following lemma:\n5\n\n\fLet a,b,c,d, N be five integers satisfying ad \u2212 bc = 1 , N > 0 . Then there exists an integer m such that\nd\u2032 := d \u2212 mc is coprime to N . Then denote D\u2032 its residue mod N , and D\u2032\u22121 its inverse.\nDirichlet has even proven that one could find an infinity of values of m such that d\u2032 is a prime number\nnot dividing N; but here the requirement is much weaker, so that one can find a convenient m again with\nhelp of the chinese remainders, because that means there exist u, v such that u(d \u2212 mc) \u2212 vN = 1 which\nis equivalent to the existence of a residue Mp modulo each p\u03bd factor of N such that the residue Dp \u2212 Mp Cp\nis invertible mod p\u03bd . If Dp is invertible, Mp = 0 works, and if Dp is not invertible , Cp is and therefore any\nMp which is not divisible by p will do the job.\nThen we have (b\u2032 = b \u2212 ma , d\u2032 = d \u2212 mc ):\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\na b\na b \u2212 ma\n1 m\n=\nc d\nc d \u2212 mc\n0 1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nA B\nThus\n\u2261 T (B \u22121)/D ST \u2212D ST \u2212(1+C )/D ST M mod N\nC D\nPhysicists' intuition would find it natural since SL2(R) is a three dimensional manifold, and indeed here\nwe have succeeded in decomposing any group element into an expression with four parameters so there is\nsome kind of one-parameter degree of arbitrariness. Nevertheless this is too naive a picture because SL2(Z) is\nreally exceptional: one needs unbounded words to express any matrix, the continued fraction of any rational\na/c can be of any arbitrary length. This is even exceptional, compared to SL3(Z).\nAs a conclusion we could say that the groups SL2(Z/N Z) appear in fact simpler than what could be\nanticipated from SL2(Z). This allowed us to improve slightly upon prior works, bringing our little stone to\nthe building.\nNevertheless there is a fascinating interplay between geometry and number theory, as usual due to the\napparently chaotic occurence of primes and congruences when one decomposes an integer, N , into its prime\nfactors. If we were considering strings, membranes or black holes we could claim that Conformal Field\nTheories bring more pieces into some cosmic hyperbolic puzzle! We prefer to let the reader appreciate the\nintrinsic beauty of mathematics and rigorous physics.\n\nExamples:\nWe finally give explicit presentations for small values of N : N = 5 is the famous F. Klein's icosaedron\n(or dodecaedron). For N = 6 we have a torus, which can be equivalently defined by the two presentations\nbelow. Another very interesting approach from a geometric point of view is to identify fundamental domains\nas done in places like Bonn by Kulkarni( see refs ). Examples of quotients from conformal theories are\ndetailed in previous texts by A.
