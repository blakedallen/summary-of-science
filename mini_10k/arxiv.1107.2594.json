Introduction\nNeutrino oscillations were first predicted nearly 50 years ago [1] and definitely established in 1998 by the Super-Kamiokande experiment with atmospheric neutrinos [2]. Several other experiments carried out in the last\ndecades with atmospheric, solar, reactor and accelerator neutrinos have established our current understanding of neutrino mixing and oscillations (see\ne.g. [3] for a review). In particular, the depletion in the \u03bd\u03bc neutrino flux\nthrough oscillation observed by several atmospheric neutrino experiments\n[2, 4] was confirmed by two accelerator experiments [5]. The fact that \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde\noscillation cannot be the dominant channel has been indirectly confirmed by\ntwo nuclear reactors experiments [6]. An indication of \u03bde appearance in a\n\u03bd\u03bc beam with a statistical significance of 2.5 \u03c3 has recently been published\nby the T2K experiment [7]. However, a direct flavour transition has not yet\nbeen established where the oscillated neutrino is identified by the charged\nlepton created in its charged current (CC) interaction. The appearance of\n\u03bd\u03c4 in an accelerator \u03bd\u03bc beam will unambiguously prove that \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 oscillation is the dominant transition channel for the neutrino atmospheric sector.\nThis is the main goal of the long-baseline OPERA experiment [8, 9], with its\ndetector exposed in the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory (LNGS) to the\nhigh energy CERN CNGS neutrino beam [10].\nThe detection of CNGS neutrino interactions in OPERA was reported\nin [11] and the observation of a first \u03bd\u03c4 candidate event was presented in\n[12]. In this paper we summarize the major improvements brought to the\nanalysis chain and to the Monte Carlo simulations. They mainly concern the\nevaluation of the efficiencies and the reduction or better control of the physics\nbackgrounds. The event statistics acquired during the first two full years of\ndata taking in 2008 and 2009 is used for the studies reported here. The\nstatistical significance of the observation of one \u03bd\u03c4 candidate event reported\nin [12] is re-assessed.\n2. The OPERA detector and the CNGS beam\nThe challenge of the OPERA experiment is to achieve the very high spatial accuracy required for the detection of \u03c4 leptons (whose decay length\nis of the order of 1 mm in this experiment) inside a large-mass active target. The hybrid detector [13] is composed of two identical Super Modules\n(SM), each consisting of an instrumented target section of a mass of about\n4\n\n\f625 tons followed by a magnetic muon spectrometer. A target section is a\nsuccession of walls filled with elements called bricks, interleaved with planes\nof scintillator strips composing the Target Tracker (TT) that triggers the\nread-out and allows localizing neutrino interactions within the target. A\nbrick is an Emulsion Cloud Chamber (ECC) module consisting of 56 1-mm\nthick lead plates interleaved with 57 nuclear emulsion films. It weighs 8.3 kg\nand its thickness corresponds to 10 radiation lengths along the beam direction. Tightly packed removable doublets of emulsion films called Changeable\nSheets (CS) are glued to the downstream face of each brick. They serve as\ninterfaces between the TT planes and the bricks to facilitate the location of\nneutrino interactions. Large brick handling ancillary facilities are used to\nbring emulsion films from the target up to the automatic scanning microscopes in Europe and Japan. Extensive information on the OPERA detector\nand facilities is given in [13, 14, 15].\nOPERA is exposed to the long-baseline CNGS \u03bd\u03bc beam [10], 730 km away\nfrom the source. The beam is optimized for the observation of \u03bd\u03c4 CC interactions. The average neutrino energy is \u223c17 GeV. In terms of interactions, the\n\u03bd\u0304\u03bc contamination is 2.1%, the \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e contaminations are together lower\nthan 1%, while the number of prompt \u03bd\u03c4 is negligible.\n3. Location of neutrino interactions\nThe expected number of neutrino events registered in the target volume\nis 850 per 1019 protons on target (p.o.t.) per 1000 tons. A 10% error is\nassigned to this number resulting from uncertainties on the neutrino flux\nand interaction cross-sections. During the 2008 and 2009 runs the average\ntarget mass was 1290 tons, of which 8.6% of dead material other than lead\nplates and emulsion films, for a total number of 1.78 \u00d7 1019 p.o.t in 2008 and\n3.52 \u00d7 1019 p.o.t. in 2009.\nWith a trigger efficiency of 99% the total numbers of triggers in 2008\nand 2009 on-time with the beam amount to 10121 and 21455, respectively.\nAbout 85% of these are due to particles entering the target after being emitted in neutrino interactions occurring in the rock surrounding or in material\ninside the LNGS cavern. This component, hereafter called external events,\nhas been disentangled during the 2008 run by performing a visual inspection\nof all on-time events. Events with topologies consistent with charged particles entering the detector or with low energy interaction of neutrons and\n\u03b3-rays, mimicking a neutral current (NC) interaction, were discarded from\n5\n\n\fthe sample. For the 2008 data, stringent criteria were used guaranteeing\na high level of purity at the cost of some inefficiency for very low activity\nevents. A total of 1698 events was retained and constitute the 2008 sample.\nIn 2009, events compatible with occurring in the target volume have been\nselected by an automatic algorithm [16, 17] developed on the basis of the\nexperience acquired with the 2008 sample. Automating the procedure reduces the human workload required by the visual inspection. It also aims at\nreaching higher efficiency for a specific category of signal events: \u03c4 emitted\nin Quasi-Elastic (QE) interactions and decaying to an electron. These have\na topology very similar to that of NC-like external events. The drawback is\nan increased contamination by external events that must be measured.\nA Monte Carlo simulation including both external events and interactions\noccurring inside the targets well reproduces the experimental data for what\nconcerns the event rates and the position distribution of the events inside the\ntargets, validating the automatic selection algorithm. This is in particular\ntrue for the low energy external NC-like events which tend to accumulate\nclose to the borders of the targets. The efficiency of the algorithm is estimated\nby simulation to be 96.2% for the CC events and 86.3% for the NC events\nwhile the contamination by external events, lower than 1% for CC events, is\n23.3% for NC events. By applying the automatic selection algorithm on the\n2009 sample 3629 events were expected from the simulation and 3693 were\neventually retained from the experimental data. The sample was further\nreduced to 3557 events after visual inspection of the event displays.\nData from the electronic detectors associated with the 5255 events reconstructed to have occurred inside the target volume were processed by a\nsoftware algorithm that selects the brick with the highest probability to contain the neutrino interaction vertex. The brick so designated is removed from\nthe target, the CS is detached and its films are searched for tracks compatible with the electronic data to verify the brick selection. In case this search\nis unsuccessful, the brick is equipped with a fresh CS and reinserted into\nthe target. A second brick is then extracted according to its probability to\ncontain the vertex complemented by a visual inspection of the event display.\nIn case the search is successful the brick is dismounted and the emulsion\nfilms are developed and dispatched to the scanning laboratories. All tracks\nmeasured with high precision in the CS films are sought for in the most downstream films of the brick. These tracks are then followed back until they are\nnot found in three consecutive films. A volume is then scanned around their\nstopping point in order to localize the interaction vertex.\n6\n\n\f4. Search for decay topologies: observation of a first \u03bd\u03c4 candidate\nevent\nPreserving high selection efficiency for the QE \u03c4 \u2192 e channel at the cost\nof a larger contamination by external events does not increase in any significant way the size of the sample of interaction vertices located in the target\n(essentially consisting of \u03bd\u03bc CC and NC events). This number can therefore\nbe predicted by relying only on the size of the essentially uncontaminated\n2008 sample. From the 1698 events constituting the 2008 sample, a fraction\nof about 5% of the events was rejected because occurring in bricks equipped\nwith poor quality emulsion films, 1000 interaction vertices have been located\nin bricks and 110 in dead material. This corresponds to vertex location efficiencies of respectively 74 \u00b1 2% and 48 \u00b1 4% for CC and NC \u03bd\u03bc interactions.\nRescaling for the number of p.o.t., the expected number of located events to\nbe searched for decays of short lived particles in the entire 2008 and 2009\nsamples is 2978 \u00b1 75. More information on detection efficiencies for signal\nevents is given in Section 5.\nThe results presented in this paper come from the decay search analysis\nof a sample of 2738 events i.e. 92% of the total statistics. 81% of the events\nhave an identified muon in the final state. The remaining 8% of events are\ncurrently being processed and the bias this may induce, if any, is negligible\nIn order to analyse the primary vertex a volume scan is performed over a\n1 cm2 area in at least 2 films upstream and 6 films downstream of the vertex\nlead plate. A procedure has been developed to detect charged and neutral\ndecays as well as secondary interaction and \u03b3-ray conversion vertices in the\nvicinity of the primary vertex; it has been introduced in [12] and detailed\ninformation can be found in [18].\nWhen a secondary vertex is found, the kinematical analysis of the whole\nevent is performed. This analysis uses the values of the angles measured in\nthe emulsion films, of the momenta determined by multiple Coulomb scattering measured in the brick, of the momenta measured by the magnetic\nspectrometers, and of the total energy deposited in the instrumented target\nacting as a calorimeter [12, 17, 19]. The energy of \u03b3-rays and electrons is\nestimated by a Neural Network algorithm that uses the combination of the\nnumber of track segments in the emulsion films and the shape of the electromagnetic shower, together with the multiple Coulomb scattering of the\nleading tracks.\nThis analysis procedure has led to the observation so far of one \u03bd\u03c4 can7\n\n\fdidate event described in detail in [12]. Among the 7 prongs at the primary\nvertex, 4 are identified as having been left by a hadron and 3 have a probability lower than 0.1% of being left by a muon, none being left by an electron.\nThe parent track exhibits a kink topology and the daughter track is identified as left by a hadron through its interaction. Its impact parameter with\nrespect to the primary vertex is (55 \u00b14) \u03bcm where it is smaller than 7 \u03bcm for\nthe other tracks. Two \u03b3-rays point to the secondary vertex. The event passes\nall the selection cuts defined in the experiment proposal and summarized in\nTable 1 [9].\nVariable\nMissing PT at primary vertex (GeV/c)\nAngle between parent track and primary\nhadronic shower in the\ntransverse plane (rad)\nKink angle (mrad)\nDaughter momentum (GeV/c)\nDaughter PT when \u03b3-ray\nat the decay vertex (GeV/c)\nDecay length (\u03bcm)\n<2\n\nCut-off\n<1.0\n> \u03c0/2\n\nValue\n0.57+0.32\n\u22120.17\n3.01\u00b10.03\n\n>20\n>2\n>0.3\n\n41\u00b12\n12+6\n\u22123\n0.47+0.24\n\u22120.12\n\nlead plates\n\n1335\u00b135\n\nTable 1: Selection criteria for \u03bd\u03c4 candidate events [9] and values measured for the\n\nfirst observed event [12].\n\nThe invariant mass of the two \u03b3-rays is (120 \u00b1 20(stat.) \u00b1 35(syst.))\nMeV/c2 , consistent with the \u03c0 0 mass.

The decay mode is therefore compatible with being \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c1\u2212 (770)\u03bd\u03c4 ,\nthe branching ratio of which is about 25%. The statistical significance of this\nobservation was estimated to be 98.2%, as the probability that the event was\nnot due to a fluctuation of the background simulating a decay in the \u03c4 \u2192 h\nchannel [12].\n5. Signal detection efficiencies and physics background\nThe validity of the Monte Carlo simulation of the electronic detectors\nresponse has been verified through a detailed comparison with experimental\n\n8\n\n\fdata. This comparison concerns the muon identification and the reconstruction of its momentum and charge, as well as the reconstruction of the total\nenergy and the hadronic shower profile [17]. The event simulation and the\noff-line reconstruction software have been extended to the response of the\nemulsion films, allowing all the algorithms used in the analysis of real events\nto be applied to simulated data. This includes scanning of the CS films,\ntrack connection between CS films and downstream films of the brick and\ntrack following towards the vertex. The subsequent scan of a volume around\nthe vertex is complemented by track following from the vertex and searching\nfor secondary decay or interaction vertices and for electromagnetic showers\n[20]. Simulation and off-line reconstruction algorithms have been successfully\nimplemented up to the events topology and their location inside the bricks.\nThe agreement between experimental and simulated data is shown in Figures 1 and 2. Further work is in progress with the aim of a full, data-driven\nsimulation of all scanning and analysis phases.\nCharged charmed particles have lifetimes similar to that of the \u03c4 lepton and share analogous decay topologies. The finding efficiency of the decay vertices is therefore also similar for both types of particles. Comparing\nthe observed charm event sample in size, decay topologies and kinematics\nwith expectations from simulations is thus a straightforward way to verify\nthat prompt-decay selection criteria and their corresponding efficiencies and\nbackgrounds are well understood. Recently published cross-sections have\nbeen used in the simulation [20]. The results of this comparison are shown in\nTable 2. Figure 3 shows the distributions of the decay length and of the angle\n\u03c6 between the parent track and the primary muon in the plane transverse\nto the beam direction. There is a good agreement between experimental\nand simulated data both in the number of expected charm events and in the\nabove distributions.\nThe expected numbers of events in the various \u03c4 channels for the nominal\nnumber of 22.5 \u00d7 1019 p.o.t. and for the fraction of the 2008 and 2009 runs\nanalysed so far are shown in Table 3. Full mixing and \u2206m223 = 2.5\u00d710\u22123 eV2\nare assumed. The total number of signal events expected to be eventually\ndetected has decreased from about 10 as quoted in the experiment proposal\n[9] to 8, essentially caused by a reduction in the interaction vertex location\nefficiencies following our more reliable knowledge of the detector and of the\nanalysis procedures. These updated location efficiencies are also shown in\nTable 3.\nThe main source of background to all \u03c4 decay channels is constituted by\n9\n\n\fFigure 1: Angle of tracks reconstructed at the primary vertex in the longitudinal horizontal\n(top) and vertical (bottom) planes: comparison between experimental data (lines with\nerror bars) and simulated data (continuous line).\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 2: Location of the primary vertex of NC events within the bricks: comparison\nbetween experimental data (lines with error bars) and simulated data (continuous line).\nMost \u03bd\u03c4 CC events have topologies similar to NC events.\n\nTopology\n\nObserved events\n\nCharged 1-prong\nNeutral 2-prong\nCharged 3-prong\nNeutral 4-prong\nTotal\n\n13\n18\n5\n3\n39\n\nExpected events\nCharm\nBackground\nTotal\n15.9\n1.9\n17.8\n15.7\n0.8\n16.5\n5.5\n0.3\n5.8\n2.0\n<0.1\n2.1\n39.1 \u00b1 7.5\n3.0 \u00b1 0.9\n42.2 \u00b1 8.3\n\nTable 2: Comparison between charm event topologies observed and expected from\n\nsimulations including background.\n\ncharged charmed particles that decay into similar channels and are produced\nin \u03bd\u03bc CC interactions where the primary muon is not identified.

Updated\nefficiencies for locating interaction vertices appear in the last column\n\nmisidentification of the decay products and the topology.\nIdentifying the muons coming from the primary vertex with the highest\npossible efficiency is important to suppress background. Details on muon\nidentification algorithms based on signals collected by the electronic detectors\ncan be found in [17]; 95% efficiency is reached for the primary muons of charm\nevents. To further reduce the muon identification inefficiency, all tracks at\nthe primary interaction of signal candidate events emitted with a polar angle\n\u03b8 smaller than 1 rad are followed within the brick in which the event occurs\nand from brick to brick. About 30% of the muons not identified as such\nby the electronic detectors are recovered through the topology of their endpoint, range-momentum correlation and energy loss measurement in the last\nfraction of their range. The residual inefficiency is dominated by muons\nemitted at angles larger than 1 rad or escaping the target to the side. The\ntechnique in particular allows a sizable reduction of the background in the\n\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc channel due to wrong associations of the muons emitted in \u03bd\u03bc CC\nevents to the vertex of secondary hadronic interactions with kink topologies.\nThis is also true for fake muons in NC events. The hadronic background\nis also lowered in the \u03c4 \u2192 h channel due to hadron interactions with kink\ntopologies at the primary vertex of \u03bd\u03bc CC events where the primary muon\nhas escaped identification in the electronic detectors. The technique had\nbeen applied to the first \u03bd\u03c4 candidate event but had however not been taken\ninto account in the background estimate since this has to be assessed via a\ncomplex simulation not available at that time.\nThe charm background has been evaluated using the charm production\ncross-sections recently published by the CHORUS Collaboration [21]; they\n13\n\n\fare significantly larger than those known at the time of the experiment proposal [9]. The charm production rate induced by neutrinos relative to the\ncharged-current cross-section is 35% higher at OPERA energies while the\nrelative charm fragmentation fraction into D + has increased from 10% to\n22%. The overall effect is a charm background increase by a factor 1.6 to 2.4\ndepending on the decay channel.\nThe second main source of background in the \u03c4 \u2192 h decay channel comes\nfrom one-prong inelastic interactions of primary hadrons produced in NC\ninteractions, or in CC interactions where the primary lepton is not identified\nand in which no nuclear fragments can be associated with the secondary\ninteraction. This has been evaluated with a FLUKA [22] based Monte Carlo\ncode, as detailed in [12] and cross-checked with three sets of measurements.\nTracks of hadrons from neutrino interactions have been followed far from\nthe primary vertex over a total length of 14 m; this corresponds to the total\nlength of tracks left by hadrons in 2300 NC events. No interactions have\nbeen found that fulfil the \u03c4 \u2192 h selection criteria. Immediately outside the\nsignal region, a total of 10 single-prong interactions have been observed with\na pT larger than 200 MeV/c, while 10.8 are expected from simulations. On\nthe top part of Figure 4 the total momentum is plotted versus the transverse\nmomentum of the final state particles for these interactions. The parameters\nspace in which \u03c4 -decay candidates are accepted is shown.\nBricks of the OPERA type exposed to pion beams have also been studied\nin order to further crosscheck the estimate of the hadron interaction background. In two test beam exposures with 4 GeV/c \u03c0 \u2212 a total of about 190\nm of track length have been followed. In the first exposure, 314 interactions\nwere localised with an angular acceptance \u03b8 < 1 rad, out of which 126 are\nsingle-prong events with a kink angle larger than 20 mrad (the same selection\ncut as for the \u03c4 decay search). In the second exposure, 220 interactions were\nlocated with an angular acceptance \u03b8 < 0.54 rad, out of which 88 are singleprong events with kink angles larger than 20 mrad. On the bottom part of\nFigure 4 the transverse momentum is plotted versus the total momentum of\nthe final state particles for the single-prong events in this second exposure.\nComparisons showing a fair agreement between experimental and simulated\ndata of both exposures are presented in Figure 5 for a set of topological\nvariables.\nThe hadron interactions background can be further reduced by increasing the detection efficiency of highly ionizing particles, low energy protons\nand nuclear fragments, emitted in the cascade of intra-nuclear interactions\n14\n\n\fT\n\nDaughter p (GeV/c)\n\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nT\n\nDaughter p (GeV/c)\n\nDaughter p (GeV/c)\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nDaughter p (GeV/c)\n\nFigure 4: Top: Scatter plot of pT vs. p of the daughter particle of single prong reinteractions of hadrons far from the neutrino interaction vertices where they are produced.\nBottom: Scatter plot of pT vs. p of the daughter particle of single prong interactions of 4\nGeV/c \u03c0 \u2212 .

This technique\nhas been used to study a sample of 64 interactions in a brick of the OPERA\ntype exposed to an 8 GeV/c \u03c0 \u2212 beam. At least one highly ionising particle\nhas been associated to (56 \u00b1 7)% of the events with a backward/forward\nasymmetry of 0.75 \u00b1 0.15, while 53% are expected from simulations with an\nasymmetry of 0.71. Figure 6 shows the fair agreement in polar angle distribution of the highly ionising particles between experimental and simulated\ndata. The technique allows detecting more highly ionising particles associated to secondary vertices. It provides an additional background reduction\nof about 20%. No such particles have been found to be associated to the\ndecay vertex of the first \u03bd\u03c4 candidate event.\nThe expected background in the muon decay channel caused by large\nangle muon scattering has been evaluated in [9].\nThe total number of expected background events has slightly decreased\nfrom 0.75 as quoted in the experiment proposal [9] to 0.73, despite a significant increase of the charm cross-sections, essentially thanks to a significant\nimprovement in the identification of the decay products as hadron or muon.\nAll background sources are summarized in Table 4. Systematic errors of\n25% on charm background and of 50% on hadron and muon backgrounds\nare assumed. Errors arising from the same source are combined linearly and\notherwise in quadrature.\n6. Signal statistical significance\nOne \u03bd\u03c4 candidate event is observed in the \u03c4 \u2192 h decay channel that passes\nall the selection cuts where 0.49 \u00b1 12 events are expected for this decay mode\nin the currently analysed sample assuming full mixing and \u2206m223 = 2.5\u00d710\u22123\neV2 . The background in this channel is estimated to 0.05 \u00b1 0.01(syst.) event.\nThe probability for the event not to be due to a background fluctuations and\nthus the statistical significance of the observation is 95%. Considering all\ndecay channels, the numbers of expected signal and background events are\nrespectively 1.65 \u00b1 0.41 and 0.16 \u00b1 0.03(syst.), the probability for the event\nto be background being 15%.\n17\n\n\fNumber of tracks\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n-1\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\ncos\u03b8\n\nFigure 6: Polar angle distributions of the highly ionising particles emitted in 8 GeV/c\n\u03c0 \u2212 interactions in an OPERA brick for experimental data (dots with error bars) and\nsimulated data (histogram).

Conclusions\nThe OPERA experiment has completed the study of 92% of the data\naccumulated during the first two years of operation in the CNGS beam (20082009) with the aim of the first detection of neutrino oscillations in direct\nappearance mode.\nThe observation so far of a single candidate \u03bd\u03c4 event is compatible with the\nexpectation of 1.65 signal events. The significance of the observation of one\ndecay in the \u03c4 \u2192 h channel has decreased from 98.2% in the first analysis [12]\nto 95%, as the size of the analysed event sample has substantially augmented.\nThe increase in the anticipated background resulting from the larger\ncharm cross-sections recently measured [21] compared to those known at\nthe time of the experiment proposal has been more than compensated by a\nhigher muon identification efficiency. In addition, the study of highly ionising\ntracks left by protons and nuclear fragments which are often associated to\nhadronic re-interactions has allowed reducing by about 20% this background\nspecific to the hadronic decay modes of the \u03c4 .\nThe event location efficiency has been re-evaluated for several phases of\nthe analysis procedure. Completing the extension of the events simulation\nand their reconstruction in the emulsion films of the target bricks, a task\nalready well advanced down to the vertex reconstruction, will help in further\ncontrolling the detection efficiencies at each step of the analysis process, from\nthe track reconstruction in the electronic detectors to the location of primary\nand secondary vertices in the emulsion films.
