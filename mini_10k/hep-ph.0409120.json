Corcella\nCERN, Department of Physics, Theory Division, CH-1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland\nAbstract - We review the main aspects of the fragmentation of bottom quarks in top quark decay.\nThe NLO b-quark energy spectrum presents large mass logarithms ln(m2t /m2b ), which can be resummed by the use of the approach of perturbative fragmentation functions. Large soft contributions\nin both coefficient function and initial condition of the perturbative fragmentation function have been\nresummed as well. Results on the energy distribution of b quarks and b-flavoured hadrons are finally\npresented in both x and moment spaces.\n\n1 Introduction\nA reliable understanding of bottom quark fragmentation in top quark decay (t \u2192 bW) will be fundamental to\naccurately measure the top properties, such as its mass mt , at present and future high-energy colliders. In fact,\nthe uncertainty on bottom quark fragmentation is one of the sources of systematic error on mt at the Tevatron\naccelerator [1] and will play a crucial role in the reconstruction of mt from final states with leptons and J/\u03c8 at the\nLHC [2].\nIn this paper we investigate bottom fragmentation in top decay within the framework of perturbative fragmentation\nfunctions [3]. We shall resum collinear logarithms \u223c ln(m2t /m2b ) and soft terms that appear in the next-to-leading\norder (NLO) b-quark energy distribution. We shall present results on the b-quark energy spectrum in top quark\ndecay and investigate the impact of collinear and soft resummation. Hadron-level results on b-flavoured hadrons\nwill be shown in xB and moment spaces.\n\n2 Collinear and soft resummation\nIn Ref. [4] NLO corrections to top decay t(pt ) \u2192 b(pb )W(pW )(g(pg )) have been computed for a massive b quark,\nand the differential width d\u0393/dxb , with xb being the normalized b-quark energy fraction in the top rest frame, has\nbeen calculated. The differential rate obtained in [4] exhibits large mass logarithms \u223c \u03b1S ln(m2t /m2b ) that need to\nbe resummed in order to improve the prediction.\nSuch contributions can be resummed by using the perturbative fragmentation approach [3], which, up to power corrections, factorizes the rate of heavy-quark production into the convolution of a coefficient function, describing the\nemission of a massless parton, and a perturbative fragmentation function D(\u03bcF , m), where \u03bcF is the factorization\nscale. In the MS factorization scheme we have:\n\"\n#MS\n\u0011MS\n\u0010x\nX Z 1 dz 1 d\u0393\u0302i\n1 d\u0393b\nb\n(xb , mt , mb ) =\n(z, mt , \u03bcF )\n, \u03bcF , m b\nDi\n\u03930 dxb\n\u03930 dz\nz\nxb z\ni\n+O ((mb /mt )p ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nIn Eq. (1) \u03930 is the Born width of the process t \u2192 bW. The O(\u03b1S ) top decay coefficient function has been\ncomputed in [4].\n\n\fThe perturbative fragmentation function expresses the transition of the massless parton into the massive quark, and\nits value at any scale \u03bcF can be obtained by solving the Dokshitzer\u2013Gribov\u2013Lipatov\u2013Altarelli\u2013Parisi (DGLAP)\nevolution equations [5, 6] once an initial condition at a scale \u03bc0F is given.\nIn [3] the NLO expression for D(\u03bc0F , m), which was argued to be process independent, was given. The process\nindependence has been lately established in a more general way in Ref. [7].\nThe initial condition of the perturbative fragmentation function reads [3]:\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u03bc2\n\u03b1S (\u03bc0 )CF 1 + x2b\nln 0F2 \u2212 2 ln(1 \u2212 xb ) \u2212 1\nDp (xb , \u03bc0F , mb ) = \u03b4(1 \u2212 xb ) +\n.\n2\u03c0\n1 \u2212 xb\nmb\n+\n\n(2)\n\nAs discussed in [4], solving the DGLAP equations for the evolution \u03bc0F \u2192 \u03bcF , with a NLO kernel, allows one to\nresum leading logarithms (LL) \u223c \u03b1nS lnn (\u03bc2F /\u03bc20F ) and next-to-leading logarithms (NLL) \u223c \u03b1nS lnn\u22121 (\u03bc2F /\u03bc20F )\n(collinear resummation). If we set \u03bc0F \u2243 mb and \u03bcF \u2243 mt , we resum large logarithms \u223c ln(m2t /m2b ), which are\nindeed the terms appearing in the massive, unevolved, NLO d\u0393/dxb .\nMoreover, both the MS coefficient function [4] and the initial condition of the perturbative fragmentation function\n(2) present, at O(\u03b1S ), terms that behave like 1/(1 \u2212 xb )+ or [ln(1 \u2212 xb )/(1 \u2212 xb )]+ , which become large for\nxb \u2192 1, i.e. for soft-gluon radiation. In Mellin moment space, such contributions correspond to behaviours\n\u223c ln N and \u223c ln2 N respectively.\nSoft contributions in the perturbative fragmentation function are process-independent and have been resummed in\n[7] with NLL accuracy. Soft terms in the coefficient function are instead process-dependent. Resummation of LL\n\u223c \u03b1nS lnn+1 N and NLL \u223c \u03b1nS lnn N contributions to the top-decay coefficient function has been performed in [8]\nand we do not report here the formulae for the sake of brevity.\n\n3 Parton-level results\nWe would like to present results on the b-quark energy distribution in top decay and investigate the effect of\ncollinear and soft resummation. In Fig. 1 we show the b-quark energy spectrum. The NLO calculation lies below\n\nFigure 1: b-quark energy distribution in top decay, according to the unresummed fixed-order calculation (dotted\nline), and after inclusion of collinear resummation (dashed) and of both collinear and soft resummations (solid).\nWe have set mt = 175 GeV, mb = 5 GeV, mW = 80 GeV, \u039bQCD = 200 MeV. In the inset figure, we show the\nsame curves on a logarithmic scale, for xb > 0.8.\nthe two resummed predictions and is divergent as xb \u2192 1. After the resummation of collinear terms \u223c ln(m2t /m2b )\nthe distribution exhibits a sharp peak at xb close to 1. Finally, the inclusion of soft-gluon resummation smoothens\nout the distribution, which exhibits the so-called Sudakov peak.\nAs discussed in [8], the implementation of collinear and soft resummation leads to a milder dependence of observables on the factorization and renormalization scales entering the calculation, which corresponds to a reduction\n2\n\n\fof the theoretical uncertainty. As an example, Fig. 2 shows the results on the dependence of the xb spectrum on\nthe factorization scale \u03bcF in Eq. (1), which is taken equal to mt /2, mt and 2mt , and the effect of soft resummation. We note that while the unresummed prediction still exhibits a dependence on the value chosen for \u03bcF , the\nimplementation of soft resummation yields three almost undistinguishable distributions.\n\nFigure 2: b-quark energy spectrum for different values of the factorization scale \u03bcF , with (solid) and without\n(dashes) NLL soft-gluon resummation.\n\n4 Hadron-level results\nWe would like to make predictions for the spectrum of b-flavoured hadrons in top decay. We write the normalized\nrate for the production of B-hadrons B as a convolution of the rate for the production of b quarks and a nonperturbative fragmentation function Dnp (x):\nZ\n\u0010x \u0011\n1 d\u0393B\n1 1 dz d\u0393b\nB\n,\n(3)\n(xB , mt , mb ) =\n(z, mt , mb )Dnp\n\u0393 dxB\n\u0393 xB z dz\nz\nwhere xB is the B normalized energy fraction. The parton-level rate d\u0393b /dz can be computed following the\nmethod which has been discussed in the previous section.\nAs for the non-perturbative fragmentation function, one can use some phenomenological models with tunable\nparameters, which are to be fitted to experimental data. We consider a power law with two parameters:\nDnp (x; \u03b1, \u03b2) =\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 x)\u03b1 x\u03b2 ,\nB(\u03b2 + 1, \u03b1 + 1)\n\n(4)\n\nthe model of Kartvelishvili et al. [9]\nDnp (x; \u03b4) = (1 + \u03b4)(2 + \u03b4)(1 \u2212 x)x\u03b4\n\n(5)\n\nand the non-perturbative fragmentation function of Peterson et al. [10]:\nDnp (x; \u01eb) =\n\nA\n.\nx[1 \u2212 1/x \u2212 \u01eb/(1 \u2212 x)]2\n\n(6)\n\nIn Eq. (4), B(x, y) is the Euler beta function; in (6) A is a normalization constant. We tune such models to e+ e\u2212\ndata from the ALEPH [11] and SLD [12] Collaboration. The ALEPH data refer to b-flavoured mesons, the SLD\ndata to baryons and mesons. When we do the fits, we must describe the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 bb\u0304 process within the same\nframework as we did for top decay, i.e. we use the perturbative fragmentation method, NLL DGLAP evolution and\nNLL soft resummation. As in [4, 8], we shall consider xB values within the range 0.18 \u2264 xB \u2264 0.94.\nIn Table 1 we show the results of our fits, along with the corresponding values of \u03c72 per degree of freedom. One\ncan see that the power law with two parameters (4) and the Kartvelishvili model (5) fit both ALEPH and SLD\n3\n\n\fTable 1: Results of fits of hadronization models to ALEPH and SLD data on b-flavoured hadron production in\ne+ e\u2212 annihilation.\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03c72 (\u03b1, \u03b2)/dof\n\u03b4\n\u03c72 (\u03b4)/dof\n\u01eb\n\u03c72 (\u01eb)/dof\n\nALEPH\n0.51 \u00b1 0.15\n13.35 \u00b1 1.46\n2.56/14\n17.76 \u00b1 0.62\n10.54/15\n(1.77 \u00b1 0.16) \u00d7 10\u22123\n29.83/15\n\nSLD\n2.04 \u00b1 0.38\n25.18 \u00b1 3.27\n11.50/16\n16.59 \u00b1 0.49\n22.19/17\n(1.61 \u00b1 0.14) \u00d7 10\u22123\n158.15/17\n\ndata rather well, while the Peterson fragmentation function is marginally consistent with ALEPH and unable to\nreproduce the SLD data. Moreover, the values of the best-fit parameters \u03b4 and \u01eb, fitted to ALEPH and SLD, are in\nagreement within two standard deviations.\nIn Fig. 3 we show our prediction for the B-hadron spectrum in top decay, using all three hadronization models\nfitted to the ALEPH data. In order to account for the uncertainties on the best-fit parameters, for each model we\nplot a band corresponding to a prediction at one-standard-deviation confidence level. From Fig. 3 we learn that the\npredictions based on the models (4) and (5) are consistent, while the Peterson model yields a distribution that lies\nquite far from the other two and is peaked at larger values of xB .\nIn Fig. 4 we plot the xB spectra yielded by models (4) and (5), but fitted to SLD. Such distributions statistically\nagree at the confidence level of two standard deviations.\nIn Fig. 5 we compare the predictions obtained using the power law with two parameters, but fitted to ALEPH and\nSLD data. We observe that the spectra are distinguishable; this difference may be related to the different hadron\ntypes that the two experiments have reconstructed.\n\nFigure 3: B-hadron energy spectrum in top decay, according to the power law (solid line), the Kartvelishvili\n(dashed) and the Peterson model (dotted), fitted to the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 bb\u0304 data from ALEPH. The plotted curves are the\nedges of bands at one-standard-deviation confidence level.\nWe finally wish to present results on the moments of the B-hadron spectrum in moment space \u0393B\nN . Such moments\nnp\nb\nD\n.\n=\n\u0393\ncan be written as the product of a perturbative and a non-perturbative contribution \u0393B\nN N The advantage of\nN\nnp\nworking in moment space is that one can extract DN\nfrom e+ e\u2212 data without relying on any specific hadronization\nmodel.\nPredictions for the moments \u0393B\nN of B-meson spectra in top decay are given in Table 2, where data from the DELPHI\nnp\nCollaboration [13] are used to obtain the non-perturbative information DN\n.

(4) and (5) to the SLD data.\n\nFigure 5: B spectrum in top decay according to the power law (4), fitted to ALEPH (solid) and SLD (dashes) data.\nand [B]) are shown, the first using \u039bQCD = 0.226 GeV and mb = 4.75 GeV, the second \u039bQCD = 0.2 GeV and\nmb = 5 GeV, the default values of this analysis. As expected, the perturbative calculations and the corresponding\nnon-perturbative components differ at the level of few per cent, according to whether one uses set [A] or [B].\nHowever, the final hadron-level predictions for the physical results \u0393B\nN differ only at the level of per mille.\n\n5 Conclusions\nWe have considered bottom quark fragmentation in top quark decay t \u2192 bW. We have pointed out that the\nfixed-order result on the b-quark energy spectrum exhibits large mass logarithms \u223c ln(m2t /m2b ), which can be\nresummed to NLL accuracy using the approach of perturbative fragmentation functions and DGLAP evolution\nequations. Moreover, NLL soft contributions to the coefficient function and to the initial condition of the perturbative fragmentation function have been resummed as well.\nWe have presented results on the b-quark spectrum in top decay, which displays a remarkable impact of the inclusion of soft and collinear resummation. In particular, the distributions exhibit very little dependence on factorization and renormalization scales.\nPredictions on b-flavoured hadron energy distributions in top decay have been obtained using ALEPH and SLD\n5\n\n\fdata to parametrize some hadronization models in xB space and DELPHI data to get non-perturbative information\nin moment space.\nThe considered approach can now be applied to study several observables, which are relevant to top quark phenomenology at the Tevatron and ultimately at the LHC and compare the obtained results with the ones given by\nMonte Carlo event generators.\nB\nb\nTable 2: DELPHI data for the moments \u03c3N\n, the resummed e+ e\u2212 perturbative calculations for \u03c3N\n[7], and the\nnp\nb\nextracted non-perturbative contribution DN . Using the perturbative results \u0393N , a prediction for the physical\nobservable moments \u0393B\nN is given.
