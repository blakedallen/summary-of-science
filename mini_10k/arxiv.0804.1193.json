This work\nexploits the I-mmse connection to bound the achievable datarate of spreading signals in wideband settings, and to conclude\nthat the achievable data-rate diminishes as the bandwidth increases due to channel uncertainty. The result applies to all\nspreading modulations, i.e. signals that are evenly spread over\nthe bandwidth available to the communication system, with SNR\nsmaller than log(W/L)/(W/L) and holds for communications over\nchannels where the number of paths L is unbounded by sublinear in the bandwidth W.\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nThis work analyzes the performance of wideband communication systems, we characterize the SNR regime that does not\nallow communications in the wideband limit. The underlying\nreason for the inability to communicate is channel uncertainty,\nand our result applies to channels where the number of\nmultipath components is unbounded and sub-linear in the\nbandwidth. Our proof is based on the I-mmse connection [3]\nand hinges on a calculation of the minimum mean square error\n(mmse) estimate of the unknown channel.\nWe consider signals that spread their power over the entire\nbandwidth, such as PPM or impulse radio [14], where the\npulse shape and duration determine the bandwidth, or direct\nsequence spread spectrum, where the chip duration determines\nthe frequency spread of the signal. Our result applies also\nto OFDM-type signals, if the entire available bandwidth is\nused concurrently. Examples of signals that are not spread over\nbandwidth are FSK and multi-tone FSK [6], [5], where each\nsymbol concentrates power on a small span of frequencies,\nalthough the entire range of symbols may span a very large\nbandwidth.\nOur result shows that channel uncertainty is detrimental to\nspreading systems operating over multipath channels where\nthe number of apparent paths is unbounded but sub-linear\nwith the system bandwidth [11], [10], essentially because\nof the signal uses too many eigen-modes of the channel.\nOur model of channel variation in time is a simplistic block\ncoherent one, where the channel is fixed for known lengths\nof time (coherence periods) and realizations over different\ncoherence periods are IID. This channel model offers the\nadvantage of eigen-modes that are particularly simple, as\nharmonic signals are eigen-modes of any linear time invariant\nchannel. The channel uncertainty a communication system\nfaces when operating over the block\u2013coherent channel is thus\nlimited to the eigen-values of the channel, or in other words to\n\nthe complex channel gain over the frequency band the system\nuses.\nThe essential feature of spreading signals that renders them\nineffective over wide bands, is that they use the entire range\nof channel eigen-modes concurrently, and are thus exposed to\nuncertainty of a large number of parameters (channel eigenvalues). Modulation schemes of the FSK type, that exploit a\nsmall number of channel eigen-modes per symbol, are exposed\nto uncertainty in only a small number of parameters.\nOur result can be extended to more complex channels,\nwhere the variation in time is described using the Doppler\nspectrum rather than by block\u2013coherence [9], [12], [2]. The\neigen-modes of such channels are approximately given by\northogonal Weyl-Heisenberg bases [4] in the under-spread\ncase, i.e. when the channel's response is highly concentrated in\nthe delay\u2013Doppler plain. The essential feature that determines\nwhether communications are possible in the wideband limit\nis the spreading of symbol power over the unknown channel\neigen-modes. In channels where the eigen-modes are not\nknown in advance, it is very difficult to overcome channel\nuncertainty.\nRelated work has shown that pulse-position modulation\n(PPM) systems are unable to handle uncertainty in the delays\nof multipath components [7], [8]. We showed that the receiver\nis unable to detect the channel paths if the bandwidth is large\nenough, whether it uses a threshold detector [7] or a maximum\nlikelihood detector [8]. This work extends the scope of past\nresults to a wider family of signals, and makes a statement on\nthe achievable rate.\nThe comparison of our result to that of Telatar & Tse [13] is\nalso interesting. The T&T results discussed continuous signals,\ni.e. effectively using a signal to noise ratio (SNR) that\n\u0001 inversely\n1\n, whereas\ndepends on the system bandwidth SNR = \u03b8 W\nour result is more general in the sense that it specifies the\nrange of SNR dependencies on bandwidth that does not allow\ncommunications in the wideband regime. In other words, our\nresult applies to impulsive systems and implicitly indicates the\nminimal level of impulsiveness that allows communications in\nthe limit of large bandwidth.\nAnother point of comparison of our result to that of [13]\nis the type of signals to which they apply. T&T consider two\ntypes of spreading signals: IID complex\nsignals and signals\nP\nwith a very low cross-correlation: i Xi Xi\u2212n \u223c const that\ndoes not depend on the length of the vector. Our result applies\nto a wider family of signals, where the cross correlation may\n\n\f\u0010\u221a \u0011\nas high as \u03b8\nW . This is significant because spreading\nsignals generated by IID or pseudo-random\nhave\n\u0011\n\u0010\u221a sequences\nW .\nan empirical correlation that varies as \u03b8\nThe results in [8], that connect the number of channel\npaths to the level of impulsiveness are also relevant here. The\nimpulsiveness parameter there is easily translated to the SNR\nper active burst of transmission, and the results in [8] basically\ndetermine a lower bound on the SNR, above which the channel\nuncertainty penalty is insignificant in the wideband limit. Our\nnew result involves an upper bound on the SNR, below which\nthe channel uncertainty penalty prevents communications.\nII. M ODEL\n\nThe channel is composed of L paths, each with a delay\nin the range [0, Td W ] where Td is the delay spread. The\nchannel is block-constant with coherence time Tc , i.e. it has\nIID realizations over different coherence periods. We assume\nTd \u226a Tc and thus justify to an extent our loose treatment of\nedge effects at the beginning of each coherence period. We\napproximate (1) with a circularly-shifted matrix:\n\u221a\n(5)\nY = SNR xH\u0303 + Z\nwhere\n\nx\n\nWe consider communication systems with a (single sided)\nbandwidth W , operating over block-coherent multipath channels. We use a real discrete model of the system, after sampling\nat the receiver at rate W . The model over a single coherence\nperiod is given by\n\u221a\nY = SNR X \u22c6 H\u0303 + Z\n(1)\nwhere Y is the received signal over an entire coherence period\nof length Tc , this is a vector with Kc = Tc W entries. The\nvector X of length Kc and average energy Kc represents the\ntransmitted signal, the multipath channel is represented by the\nvector H\u0303 of length Kc and \u22c6 marks a convolution. Z is white\nstandard Gaussian noise (IID with zero mean and variance\none) and SNR is the signal to noise ratio. The SNR can be\nunderstood as the signal to noise ratio per frequency resolution\nbin or per degree of freedom. We neglect in (1) the edge effects\nat the beginning of the coherence period.\nWe impose a probabilistic energy constraint:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\n(2)\nP kXk > (1 + o(1)) Kc \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0\nW \u2192\u221e\n\nNote that IID signaling satisfies this assumption.\nThe transmitted signal may be impulsive, we consider the\nsignal to noise ratio during active transmission so there is no\nneed to explicitly address the impulsiveness used by the system\n(i.e. the duty cycle ratio). We assume that the transmitter\ndoes not use information on the channel realization, and the\ntransmitted signal does not depend on it.\nThe transmitted signal X is wideband: its empirical autocorrelation is upper bounded by\nE\nD\np\nX i , X j \u2264 B4 K c\ni 6= j i, j = 1, . . . , Kc (3)\n\nwith B4 is a constant that does not depend on the bandwidth.\nThe notation < , > is used for the inner product of vectors,\nand the notation X i is used for a vector X that is cyclicly\nshifted by i positions, i.e.\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nX(1\u2212i)\n\uf8ec X(2\u2212i) \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(4)\nXi = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n..\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n.\nX(Kc \u2212i)\nwhere ( \u2212 ) indicates a mod Kc difference.\n\n=\n\n=\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nX1\nX2\n..\n.\n\nXKc\nX1\n\n...\nXKc\n..\n.\n\nX2\n...\n..\n.\n\n...\n\nX2\n\nX1\n\nXKc\nX0\n\nX1\n\n...\n\nX Kc \u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\u0001\n\n(6)\n\nThe channel model is real, L channel gains are IID and\nzero mean, with variance 1/L, so the energy in the channel's\nimpulse response equals one on average.

The coherent datarate upper bound (top graph) is linear in the\nlow SNR regime, and convex. The channel uncertainty penalty in the bottom\ngraph is linear for low SNR values, and saturates at the channel's entropy.\nThe incoherent datarate (middle graph) is not convex.\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nThe term I Y ; H\u0303|x in (9) is the datarate penalty due to\nchannel uncertainty.\nThe proof of Theorem 1 is based on calculating the mmse\nestimate of the channel response H\u0303, given the transmitted and\nthe received signals. We show that this mmse estimate is a\nvector with an o(1) norm in low SNR conditions, essentially\nbecause the noise Z overwhelms the information carrying\nsignal.\nTheorem 1 shows that in the wideband limit, the low SNR\nregime can be divided in to parts:\nlog Kc /L\nKc /L\n\n(10)\n\nwhere spreading signals are not effective, and\nSNR >\n\nlog Kc /L\nKc /L\n\n(11)\n\nwhere although the SNR diminishes in the limit, it enables a\npositive datarate.\nThe channel uncertainty penalty is upper bounded by the\nchannel entropy, and the bottom graph of Figure 1 thus\nc /L\nsaturates at SNR = logKK\n+ o(L)\nKc , where the first part\nc /L\ncorresponds to he entropy of the paths' delays and the second\nto their gains.\nV.

At these\npositions, any non-zero value of \u0124j\u2032 increases the estimation\nerror and can be disregarded in the calculation of a lower\nbound on the mmse. Let us examine the positions where H\u0303i 6=\n0 and (7) holds, and look at the estimates of each such value:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\u221a\nRR\nR\nSNR x H\u0303 \u2212 H + Z\n\u0124i\u2032 =\n...\nHi f s\nRR\n\n...\n\nR\n\nf (H) dH1 dH2 . . . dHL /\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\nfs\nSNR x H\u0303 \u2212 H + Z\n\nf (H) dH1 dH2 . . . dHL\n\n(19)\n\nWe prove that the mmse estimate (19) is very small by\ncomparing the integral in the nominator to the integral in\nthe denominator, that effectively sums over a bigger group of\nassignments of H. Assuming (7) we show that the nominator\nof (19) is negligible when compared to its denominator.\nWe first approximate both integrals in (19) by sums over\nsampled groups of values of each positions in the vectors H.\n\n\fThe sampling is done over a tight enough grid that the resulting\nerrors are small.\nAn upper bound to (19) is calculated by breaking the sum\nin the denominator to a series of sums over groups of values\nof H, where each group corresponds to a single assignment of\nH in the nominator. The set B consists of assignments with a\nnon-zero value Hi 6= 0. Rewriting the discrete approximation\nof (19) we get\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\u221a\nP\nSNR\nx\nH\u0303\n\u2212\nH\n+\nZ\np (H)\nH\nf\ni\ns\nH\u2208B\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0124i\u2032 = P\n(20)\nSNR x H\u0303 \u2212 G + Z p (G)\nG\u2208B+Bc fs\n\nthe notation G was introduced to improve clarity we define\np(H) = f (H)\u2206H L and \u2206H is the sampling step of each\ndimension of the vector H.\nWe proceed to divide the entire range of vectors G into nonoverlapping subgroups, such that for each H \u2208 B we have a\ncorresponding subgroup A (H), such that\n\u0010 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\nHi fs x H\u0303 \u2212 H + Z p (H)\n\u0010 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\n(21)\nJ(H) = P\nG\u2208A(H) fs x H\u0303 \u2212 G + Z p (G)\n\ndiminishes in the limit of large bandwidth. The convergence\nof (20) to zero follows directly, as the nominator of (20) is a\nsum of the nominators of J(H) for all H \u2208 B.\nThe subgroups A(H) are created randomly. For each assignment of G that has a non-zero value in the ith position,\nit is put in the subgroup A(G). For a vector G with Gi = 0\nwe (uniformly) choose one of its non-zero taps and replace it\nto the ith position. To clarify the process, let us say that the\nj th position of the vector G was chosen. We calculate a new\nvector H by\nHi = Gj ; Hj = 0 ; Hk = Gk for k 6= i, j\n\n(22)\n\nand assign the vector G to the subgroup A(H).\nEach group A(H) contains H and about (Kc \u2212 L) /L other\nmembers, each different from H in exactly two positions. We\nensure that groups' sizes do not deviate significantly from\n(Kc \u2212 L) /L by relocating memebers from large groups into\nsuitable smaller ones.\nWe denote by H i\u2192k a member of A(H) that differs from\nH by exchanging the values in its ith and k th positions, and\ndefine H i\u2192i = H. The set K(H) holds the values of k such\nthat H i\u2192k \u2208 A(H).\nThe terms p (H) in the nominator of (21) and p (G) in the\ndenominator are identical for all members of the group A(H)\nbecause of our assumptions on IID gains and a uniform spread\nof the path delays.\n\u001a\n\u001b\n2\n\u221a\n1\ni\u2192i\nHi exp \u2212 2 Y \u2212 SNR xH\n\u001b\n\u001a\nJ(H) =\n2\n\u221a\nP\n1\ni\u2192k\nY\n\u2212\nSNR\nxH\nexp\n\u2212\nk\u2208K(H)\n2\n\n(23)\nThe denominator of (23) contains a sum over about Kc /L\nexponents with different values of k, including k = i and\n\nthe nominator holds a signal such factor with k = i.
