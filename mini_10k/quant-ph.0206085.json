It is exemplified by the Coulomb\nplus harmonic oscillator in D dimensions after a complexification of its Hamiltonian\nwhich keeps the energies real. Infinitely many bound states are found in closed form\nwhich generalizes the popular harmonic-oscillator states at zero charge and even\nparity. Apparently, the model is halfway between exact and quasi-exact.\n\nPACS 03.65.Ge, 03.65.Fd\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation for the shifted and charged harmonic oscillator in D dimensions\nreads\n\"\n\nd2\nl(l + 1) f\n\u2212 2+\n+ + 2 g r + r 2 \u03c6(r) = E \u03c6(r),\ndr\nr2\nr\n#\n\nr \u2208 (0, \u221e).\n\n(1)\n\nThirty years ago, Andr\u00e9 Hautot [1] noticed that at certain non-vanishing couplings\nf and/or g it may posses elementary solutions for the equidistant set of the energy\nlevels\n(Hautot)\n\nE = En,l\nn = 0, 1, . . . ,\n\n= 2n + 2 + L \u2212 g 2,\n\n(2)\n\nL = L(l) = 2l + 1 = D \u2212 2, D, D + 2, . . .\n\nwhich do not depend on the charge f . The charge itself is not arbitrary (for this\nreason, the models of this type are called quasi-exactly solvable, QES). One has to\nevaluate the admissible values of f = fn as real roots of certain polynomials of the\n(n \u2212 1)\u2212st degree (see below).\n\nThe undeniable mathematical as well as physical appeal of QES solutions has\n\nbeen revealed by many independent authors whose work was summarized by Alex\nUshveridze [2]. Very recently, the QES models helped to clarify some counterintuitive\nformal features of the so called PT symmetric quantum mechanics of Bender et al\n\n[3] who replaced the usual Hermiticity H = H \u2020 by the mere commutativity of the\n\nHamiltonian with the product of parity P and time reversal T . In the early stages of\n\ndevelopment, the studies of this formalism were strongly motivated by its relevance in\nfield theory [4]. In such a setting, it was very impressive when Bender and Boettcher\n[5] demonstrated that in contrast to the current Hermitian case, quartic polynomial\noscillators belong to the QES class after their appropriate PT symmetrization (cf.\nalso ref. [6] for more details).\n\nThe charged harmonic oscillator (1) does not possess similar appeal in field theory\nbut it was still amusing to reveal in paper [7] that its Schr\u00f6dinger equation does not\nlose its partial elementary solvability even after the weakening of the Hermiticity\nto the mere PT symmetry of its Hamiltonian. In accord with the Buslaev's and\nGrecchi's recipe [8] we used the shifted coordinates x \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) on complex line\n\n1\n\n\fr(x) = x \u2212 i \u03b5 at a constant distance \u03b5 > 0 from the real axis,\nd2\nl(l + 1)\nFn\n\u2212 2+ 2\n+i\n+ 2 i b r(x) + r 2 (x) \u03c8n (x) = En \u03c8n (x).\ndx\nr (x)\nr(x)\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n(3)\n\nUnfortunately, we only analyzed the l = 0 solutions in the quasi-odd regime (cf. a\nmore detailed explanation below).\nSince the publication of paper [7] a significant progress has been achieved in the\ninterpretation of the non-Hermitian equations. Several authors [9] emphasized that\nwithin the domain of quantum mechanics, the PT symmetry of eq. (3) should be\n\nreplaced by the (formally equivalent but mathematically more natural) requirement\nof the pseudo-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian,\nH = \u03b7 \u22121 H \u2020 \u03b7,\n\n\u03b7 = \u03b7\u2020.\n\n(4)\n\nOne of the oldest illustrations of the efficiency of the use of the pseudo-Hermitian\nHamiltonians (4) with an auxiliary indefinite metric \u03b7 appears in the relativistic\nquantum mechanics where it very naturally originates from the Feshbach's and Villars' Hamiltonian formulation of the Klein Gordon equation for the particles with\nzero spin [10]. The same choice of a suitable invertible \u03b7 helps to clarify some contemporary problems in the cosmological models based on the equations of Bryce de\nWitt [11].\nIn the light of eq. (4), physical interpretation of the non-Hermitian bound states is\nmore transparent and does not depend too much on the specification of the operator\n\u03b7 itself. This operator only plays the role of a certain auxiliary transformation of the\ndual Hilbert space. For a detailed explanation of this idea we recommend the older\nreview [12] where the physical meaning of the nontrivial \"metric\" \u03b7 was illustrated\nby its emergence in the many-fermion models where \u03b7 6= I characterizes the so called\n\nDyson's mapping of the \"physical\" (and Hermitian) fermionic Hamiltonians onto\ntheir \"more easily solvable\" \u03b7\u2212Hermitian bosonic equivalents [13].\nOne must keep in mind the non-uniqueness of the metric \u03b7 which belongs to the\n\ngiven H. According to A. Mostafazadeh [14] one can replace the initial indefinite\n(and, in particular, PT \u2212symmetric) metric \u03b71 by an alternative \u03b72 which is positive definite. In the other words, the puzzling quasi-unitary evolution generated by\n\n2\n\n\fthe indefinite \u03b71 [15] may be declared an artifact of our constructions. Vice versa,\nall the phenomenological considerations should necessarily be related to the positive\ndefinite version \u03b72 > 0 of the metric (one can show that is exists for all the diagonalizable Hamiltonians [9, 14]). Then, the time evolution remains compatible with\nthe probabilistic interpretation of the norm in the Hilbert space of states.\nIn the light of the possible peaceful coexistence of \u03b71 = P with some \u03b72 > 0 in\n\neq. (4), our attention has been re-directed to the solutions of eq. (3) which diverge in\nthe simple-minded Hermitian limit \u03b5 \u2192 0 and which were omitted from the scope of\nour preceding study [7]. We are going to correct the omission now. Our expository\n\nsection 2 will outline an improvement of the method which generates the old QES\nsolutions of ref. [7]. Section 3 will then modify the basic ansatz which opens the\nway towards the new (or, in the wording of our title, \"forgotten\") QES solutions of\neq. (3). Some of their properties and possible applications will be finally discussed\nin section 4.\n\n2\n\nThe standard quasi-exact solutions\n\nAs long as the differential eq. (3) is of the second order, its general solution is a\nsuperposition of some two linearly independent solutions. This independence may\nbe deduced from their available leading-order form near the origin,\n\u0010\n\n\u03c8n (r) = c\u2212 \u03c8n(\u2212) (r) + c+ \u03c8n(+) (r),\n\n\u03c8n(\u00b1) (r) = O r 1/2\u2213(l+1/2)\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nIn the spirit of ref. [7] one usually searches for the polynomial solutions compatible\nwith the correct physical boundary conditions in the origin (i.e., c+ = 0 [16]) as well\nas with their asymptotic normalizability. In the spirit of the general QES philosophy\none may meet both these requirements by employing the special elementary ansatz\nof the very common harmonic-oscillator-like form\n\u03c8(x) =\n\n\u03c8n(\u2212) (x)\n\n\u2212r 2 /2\u2212i b r\n\n=e\n\nN\nX\n\nhn(\u2212) (i r)n+l+1 ,\n\nn=0\n\nr = r(x) = x \u2212 i \u03b5.\n\n(6)\n\nThe construction of the solutions of this type degenerates to the insertion of eq.

(7)\n\ninto the constraint\nE = E (\u2212) = 2N + 2 + L + b2 .\n\n(9)\n\nIn the other words, the condition of the mutual compatibility of the original overdetermined linear system (7) fixes the energy which coincides with the old Hautot's\nformula (2). At any N = 0, 1, . . . the energy is an increasing function of the angular\nmomentum l or L and of the size of the shift b.

We are now going to describe a\nremarkable exception from this discouraging rule.\n\n3\n\nNonstandard, quasi-even QES states\n\n3.1\n\nThe concept of quasi-parity\n\nAbove we emphasized that at a fixed, non-vanishing shift \u03b5 > 0 the ambiguity of the\nmetric \u03b7 opens the possibility of using the \"simpler\" conjugation (4) with \u03b7 = \u03b71 = P\n\nduring the explicit constructions of the solutions while switching to their \"physical\"\nre-interpretation based on an alternative scalar product with the positive definite\nmetric \u03b72 > 0. In such an approach both components c\u2212 6= 0 and c+ 6= 0 of wave\n\nfunctions in eq. (5) may be equally useful.\n\nOnce we relax the redundant boundary conditions in the origin we get more\nsolutions of course. One of the most transparent illustrations of the emergence of\n\n5\n\n\fthe additional \"quasi-even\" c+ 6= 0 solutions was described in ref. [17] where eq. (3)\nhas been solved at the vanishing b = Fn = 0. The superscripts in the resulting\n\nstates \u03c8n(+) (r) and \u03c8n(\u2212) (r) have been interpreted as the so called quasi-parity. The\nintroduction of this concept was motivated by the observation that the quasi-parity\ndegenerated to the current parity at b = Fn = l = 0 (cf. eq. (5)).\nIts independent additional support appeared in ref. [18] revealing its connection\nwith the PT parity and with the pseudo-norm using \u03b7 = \u03b71 = P. It even plays its\nrole in the supersymmetric quantum mechanics (cf. ref. [19] for more details) but is\nmissing from our ansatz (6) inherited from ref. [7]. As we understand it now, ansatz\n(6) is unnecessarily restrictive as it represents merely quasi-odd solutions.

One verifies easily that\n\nthe acceptance of this condition is consistent with the quasi-parity (13). The wave\nfunction coefficients themselves remain formally determined by the (+) \u2212superscripted\n\nversion of the determinants (8) whose dimension grows with N.

[7] was purely psychological.\nIndeed, at the simplest choice of L = 1 in eq. (16) (which may mean both the s\u2212wave\n\nin three dimensions and an even state at D = 0) one does not obtain anything new.\n(+)\n\nEquation (16) provides the single root F0 (N) = 0 and one just reveals the well\nknown fact that at the vanishing eigencharge our model degenerates to the linear\nharmonic oscillator defined on the whole line.\nLet us move, therefore, to the first nontrivial choice of L = 2 corresponding to\n\nthe p\u2212wave in two dimensions or to the s\u2212wave in four dimensions. This gives the\nfollowing two series of the fully non-numerical eigencharges,\nq\n\nF[1,2] (N) = \u00b1 (b2 + 2N).\n\n8\n\n(17)\n\n\fThe wave functions retain the even quasi-parity in a way compatible with eq. (13),\ni\n1 h\n(+)\nb + F[1,2] (N) h1 [1,2] (N).\n2N\nBoth the eigencharges grow with the increasing size of the shift b and with the number\n(+)\n\nh0 [1,2] (N) = \u2212\n\nN of nodes (i.e., with the energy EN ). In the coupling-energy plane our QES states\nmay be visualized as families located along certain curved lines which, in a way, lie\nsomewhere in between the harmonic-oscillator F = 0 straight line and the numerous\nHautot's sets of roots Fk (N) each of which is defined at a fixed energy or integer N.\nSometimes, the similar families of the bound states with the \"energy = constant\"\nproperty are being called Sturmians. In this sense one could speak here about a\ncertain further generalization of the latter concept.\n3.3.2\n\nL=3\n\nA mild formal shortcoming of the present Coulomb + harmonic oscillators lies in\na quick growth of complexity of eq. (16) for the larger L. At any L \u2265 3 one\nshould not be tempted to generate the formulae verifying, say, the smooth N\u2212 and\nb\u2212dependence of the eigencharges. In practice, the other approaches may definitely\nprove preferable.\nEven at the very first L = 3 the comparatively compact form of our eq. (16),\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\n2b \u2212 F\n\ndet \uf8ec \u22122N\n\uf8ed\n0\n\n\u22122\n\n\u2212F\n\n0\n\u22122\n\n\u22122N + 2 \u22122b \u2212 F\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n= 0,\n\n(18)\n\nshould not inspire a search for the triplet of charges {F0 , F1 , F2 } via the closed (i.e.,\n\nCardano) formulae (the reader is recommended to try to generate them using the\ncomputer symbolic manipulations in order to see that they really are enormously\nclumsy). A significantly better strategy consists in an elimination of the (unique)\nvalue of N from the above secular determinant (18) giving\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n4F b2 + 8b \u2212 F 3 \u2212 4F .\n8F\nAfter we fix any left-hand-side integer N we may pick up the two eigenshifts b[1,2] as\n\nN = N(F, b) = \u2212\n\nelementary functions of the indeterminate variable F (we skip the details which are\ntrivial).\n\n9\n\n\fL>3\n\n3.3.3\n\nThe main advantage of the semi-implicit techniques of the solution of eq. (16) is that\nthey may work at a few larger integers L > 3. For illustration, the choice of L = 5\n\n(which corresponds to the d\u2212wave in three dimensions) leads already to the purely\nnumerical determination of eigencharges F . In an alternative approach we eliminate\nN\u00b1 =\n\nq\n1\n\u2212768b \u2212 256F b2 + 768F + 40F 3 \u00b1 24 (1024b2 + 192bF 3 + 512F 2 + F 6 )\n512F\n\u0014\n\nand recommend the graphical determination of the eigenvalues F = F (b) and/or\nb = b(F ) afterwards.\nThe most practical possibility consists in a direct selection of a suitable shift b\nfollowed by the subsequent diagonalization of the purely numerical matrix. In an\nillustration using L = 3 and b = 5 one gets the three eigencharges\nF = {10.757, \u221210.400, \u22120.35755}\nat the smallest possible N = 2. In an opposite-extreme using N = 1000 the computed\nvalues\nF = {89.98, \u221289.975, \u22120.0049407}\nalready lie very close to their large\u2212N estimate obtainable in closed form,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nF \u2248 { 8N , \u2212 8N , \u2212b/N} \u2248 {89.44, \u221289.44, \u22120.005}.\nThis simplifies the verification of the reality of the eigencharges and confirms the\nsmoothness of their N\u2212dependence. Such a type of calculation is very quick and\ngives results sampled at L = 4 and b = 5 in Table 1.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe main merit of our key eq. (16) (which defines the eigencharges) is that its\ndimension is independent of the quantum number N. Equation (17) is the best\nillustration of the related new form of the solvability which we intended to describe\nhere. Still, the principle of the whole construction is more general and one might\ntry to apply the similar recipe to the quartic oscillator of refs. [5, 6], to the sextic\n\n10\n\n\u0015\n\n\foscillators studied by many authors [20], to the decadic oscillator of ref. [21] and to\nthe numerous existing modifications [2] of these most popular or \"canonical\" models.\n\n4.1\n\nNon-orthogonal QES states as a basis?\n\nIn our particular example, the strength of the Coulombic interaction appears to be\nan energy- or N\u2212dependent quantity. One deals with an L \u2265 2 generalization of\nthe common L = 1 harmonic oscillator. Its most important features are an apparent\n\ncompleteness \"in a relevant subspace\" (a guess inspired by their infinite number) and\na compact form (reflecting the N\u2212independent evaluation of the eligible charges,\neach of which is selected as a function of the main quantum number N = 0, 1, . . .).\nBoth these features make our infinite set(s) of the quasi-even states very similar to\nthe ordinary harmonic oscillator basis. In the context of concluding remarks, let us\npay some attention to the possible analogies of the latter type.\nFirstly, due to the non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian H(F ) = H(0) + F W we\nhave to distinguish between the left (= double-ket) and right (= single-ket) QES\neigenstates,\n[H(0) + FN W ] |Ni = EN |Ni,\n\n(19)\n\nhhN| [H(0) + FN W ] = EN hhN|.\n\n(20)\n\nThe integer N numbers the energies EN as well as the selected charges FN =\nF[ k](+) (N) so that the left and right eigenstates exist at the common energies (14)\nand charges [say, (17)]. The wave functions are defined in closed form, as polynomials in the coordinates (cf. (11)) and in the couplings and quantum numbers (cf. (8)).\nThis is of paramount importance, making our quasi-even QES solutions extremely\nsimilar to the even bound states of the exactly solvable chargeless oscillators which\nform one of the most popular complete bases in L2 (0, \u221e).\n\nIn a tentative parallel one could search for the appropriately weakened biorthog-\n\nonality relations. This is a real mathematical challenge since our QES solutions are\nonly defined at the exceptional and l\u2212 and N\u2212dependent charges. Still, one can\neasily verify the manifest non-orthogonality of the pairs of many randomly selected\nQES states. Of course, the closed form as well as the infinite number of these states\ninspires their use in a perturbative or variational context.\n\n11\n\n\fFor the similar purposes one has to truncate their set to a finite subset (N < \u221e),\n\nassuming that the matrix of their overlaps\nQm,n = hhm|ni,\n\nm, n = 0, 1, . . . N\n\nis invertible. We may then proceed, say, in the variational spirit and reduce our\nHilbert space and its dual to the finite-dimensional subspaces spanned by our subset\nof the selected QES eigenvectors. The approximate identity operator becomes defined\nby the usual series\nI=\n\nN\nX\n\nm,n=0\n\n|mi Rm,n hhn|\n\nwhere R = Q\u22121 is, in general, fully non-diagonal. Also the Hamiltonian H(F ) itself\nbecomes approximated by a non-diagonal matrix. At almost all F , the search for\nthe energies E = E(F ) becomes, therefore, a numerical task.\n\n4.2\n\nSpeculations about applicability\n\nIn spite of the unpleasant character of the latter conclusion, one should still feel the\ndifference between a fully general matrix diagonalization and our \"next-to-solvable\"\nCoulomb + harmonic problem considered at any charge F ,\n[H(0) + F W ] |\u03a8i = E(F ) |\u03a8i .\n\n(21)\n\nIn particular, our Schr\u00f6dinger equation may be (e.g., perturbatively) connected to\nits special cases with QES character. In an attempted step towards making such a\nconnection explicit, let us imagine that equations (19) and (20) share the energy and\ncharge (though not the eigevectors) at every given N. This means that, respectively,\nwe have the relations\nhhN| [H(0) + FM W ] |Mi = EM hhN|Mi,\n\n(22)\n\nhhN| [H(0) + FN W ] |Mi = EN hhN|Mi\n\n(23)\n\nthe subtraction of which gives the strongest constraint\n(FM \u2212 FN ) hhN| W |Mi = (EM \u2212 EN ) QN,M .\n12\n\n(24)\n\n\fThis relation is an immediate generalization of the bi-orthogonality of the states\nwhich would result from it in the hypothetical case of the subscript-independent\ncharges FM = FN .\nLet us now return to the relations (22) and (23) and deduce the matrix form of\nthe Coulomb + harmonic Hamiltonian H(F ) at any value of the charge,\nhhN| H(F ) |Mi = (F \u2212 FM ) hhN| W |Mi + EM QN,M .\n\n(25)\n\nThis formula will help us to avoid the tedious and most time consuming part of\nthe diagonalization of H(F ), viz, the evaluation of the input matrix elements which\nprecedes the solution of the problem (21) studied in its explicit matrix form which\ndefines, in principle, all the necessary components pN = hhN|\u03a8i of the wave functions\n|\u03a8i =\n\nN\nX\n\nm,n=0\n\n|mi Rm,n pn .\n\nAt this moment we have to re-emphasize that we do not intend to perform any\nnumerical calculations. We rather wish to stress the helpful role which can be played\nby the QES states. In such a context, the number of the necessary input matrix\nelements encounters the most drastic reduction after the insertion of eq. (25) in\neq. (21),\nX\n\nK,J\n\n(F \u2212 FN ) hhN| W |Ki RK,J pJ = (E \u2212 EN ) pN .\n\n(26)\n\nNext, the necessary input information is further reduced by the generalized biorthogonality relations (24) which express all the off-diagonal elements of the (in our example, Coulombic) operator W in terms of the known overlap matrix Q. In this way\nthe numerical or perturbative diagonalization of the matrix Schr\u00f6dinger eq. (26),\n(F \u2212 FN )\n\nX\nJ\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0TN\n\nRN,J +\n\nX\n\nK6=N\n\n\uf8f9\n\nEN \u2212 EK\nQN,K RK,J \uf8fb pJ = (E \u2212 EN ) pN ,\nFN \u2212 FK\n\n(27)\n\nN = 0, 1, . . . , N\n\nwill require the independent input evaluation of the mere diagonal matrix elements\nTN = hhN| W |Ni assuming of course that we always have FM 6= FN for M 6= N. We\nmay summarize that the main merit of the use of the QES states lies in the compact\nand easily generated matrix form of our Coulomb + harmonic matrix Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation at any non-QES charge F .\n\n13\n\n\f4.3\n\nOutlook\n\nWe have seen that our system (3) may quite efficiently be treated by the nonnumerical as well as almost purely numerical means. In the former sense it has\nbeen shown to lie somewhere in between the QES and exactly solvable category (cf.\nTable 2). In comparison with its completely solvable neighbor (i.e., with its own\nharmonic oscillator special case of ref. [17]), its nontrivial b 6= 0 and F 6= 0 versions\n\ndo not generate all their bound states in the elementary form. Still, in contrast to\nthe quasi-odd QES model [7] in Table 2, its present quasi-even partner supports an\ninfinite number of bound states in the closed, elementary form. Thus, our example\n(as well as any one of its many analogs) could be assigned a \"midway\" status in some\nof its applications and interpretations.\n\nAcknowledgement\nWork supported by GA AS (Czech Republic), grant Nr.
