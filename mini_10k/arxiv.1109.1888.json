We develop a phase space distribution function approach to redshift space distortions\n(RSD), in which the redshift space density can be written as a sum over velocity moments of the distribution function. These moments are density weighted and have well defined physical interpretation:\ntheir lowest orders are density, momentum density, and stress energy density. The series expansion is\nconvergent if k\u03bcu/aH < 1, where k is the wavevector, H the Hubble parameter, u the typical gravitational velocity and \u03bc = cos \u03b8, with \u03b8 being the angle between the Fourier mode and the line of sight.\nWe perform an expansion of these velocity moments into helicity modes, which are eigenmodes under\nrotation around the axis of Fourier mode direction, generalizing the scalar, vector, tensor decomposition of perturbations to an arbitrary order. We show that only equal helicity moments correlate and\nderive the angular dependence of the individual contributions to the redshift space power spectrum.\nWe show that the dominant term of \u03bc2 dependence on large scales is the cross-correlation between\nthe density and scalar part of momentum density, which can be related to the time derivative of the\nmatter power spectrum. Additional terms contributing to \u03bc2 and dominating on small scales are the\nvector part of momentum density-momentum density correlations, the energy density-density correlations, and the scalar part of anisotropic stress density-density correlations. The second term is what\nis usually associated with the small scale Fingers-of-God damping and always suppresses power, but\nthe first term comes with the opposite sign and always adds power. Similarly, we identify 7 terms\ncontributing to \u03bc4 dependence.

Galaxies are not a faithful tracer of dark matter, as their clustering strength is biased\nrelative to the dark matter. However, they are expected to follow the same gravitational potential as\nthe dark matter and hence have the same velocities. This is not observable through angular clustering,\nwhich is only sensitive to correlations transverse to the line of sight. It is however detectable in redshift\nsurveys, because the redshift of the galaxy does not provide information only on the radial distance,\nbut also on the radial velocity through the Doppler shift. This induces anisotropies in the clustering,\nwhich are generically called redshift space distortions (RSD) [1]. They provide an opportunity to\nextract information on the dark matter clustering directly. On large scales clustering of galaxies\nalong the line of sight is enhanced relative to the transverse direction due to peculiar motions and\nthis allows one to determine the ratio of logarithmic rate of growth f to bias b [2]. Combining the\nstatistics from different lines of sight one can eliminate the unknown bias and measure directly the\nlogarithmic rate of growth times the amplitude.\nIt has been argued that using RSD information could greatly increase our knowledge of cosmological models, including tests of dark energy and general relativity [3\u20135]. Galaxy clustering has clear\nadvantages over the alternatives such as weak lensing: it is intrinsically 3-dimensional, thus providing\nbetter statistics, and it has high signal to noise. While most of the predictions in the literature are\nmodel dependent, a generic statement can be made that if systematic effects were perfectly understood RSD would be one of the most powerful techniques for such studies. The main problem with\nRSD is that nonlinear velocity effects extend to rather large scales and give rise to a scale dependent\nand angular dependent clustering signal. It is easy to see these effects in any real redshift survey: one\nsees elongated features along the line of sight, called the fingers-of-god (FoG) effect, which are caused\nby random velocities inside virialized objects such as clusters, which scatter galaxies along the radial\ndirection in redshift space, even if they have a localized spatial position in real space. This is just\nan extreme example and other related effects, such as nonlinear infall streaming motions, also cause\nnonlinear corrections. This means that one needs to understand these and separate them from the\nnonlinear evolution of the dark matter and from the nonlinear relation between the galaxies and the\ndark matter, both of which also give rise to a scale dependent bias [6].\nSeveral recent studies have investigated these nonlinear effects [7\u201313], some limiting the analysis\nto dark matter only and some also including galaxies or halos. The common denominator of these\nstudies is that they are based on various ansatzes for the scale and angular dependence of RSD,\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\ftypically combined with some perturbation theory analysis. This has the advantage of having just\na few free parameters, so that if the ansatz is accurate one can model the effects accurately. The\nreverse is also true and the problem is that it is difficult to make general statements regarding the\nrange of validity for any given model. There is another problem connected to perturbation theory,\nin that the usual perturbation theory makes a single stream approximation, which we know breaks\ndown on small scales inside the virialized halos (indeed, FoG are a manifestation of multi-streaming\non small scales).\nIn this paper we present a different approach to RSD: we use a distribution function approach\nto show that one can make a series expansion of RSD, which is convergent on sufficiently large scales\nand we derive the most general form of RSD correlator allowed by the symmetries. In this paper we\npresent the formal derivations and conceptual implications, reserving all the applications to future\nwork. The structure of this paper is as follows: in section 2 we develop the distribution function\napproach to RSD and derive the helicity decomposition. In section 3 we discuss the power spectra,\nand use rotation symmetries to derive the most general form of the RSD correlator. We also discuss\nthe lowest order contributions and connect them to physical quantities such as density, momentum,\nstress energy tensor etc. This is followed by a discussion in section 4.\n\n2\n\nRedshift-space distortions from the distribution function\n\nThe exact evolution of collisionless particles is described by the Vlasov equation [14]. Following the\ndiscussion by [15], we start from the distribution function of particles f (x, q, \u03c4 ) at a phase-space\nposition (x, q) and at conformal time \u03c4 in order to derive the perturbative redshift-space distortions.\nHere x is the comoving position and q = p/a = mu is the comoving momentum, where u = dx/d\u03c4 .\nIn the following we will omit the time dependence, i.e we will write f (x, q). The density field in real\nspace is obtained by averaging the distribution function over momentum:\nZ\n\u03c1 (x) \u2261 mp d3 q f (x, q) ,\n(2.1)\nwhere mp is the particle mass and a = 1/(1 + z) is the scale factor (z is the redshift). In redshift\nspace the position is distorted by peculiar velocities, thus the comoving redshift-space coordinate for\na particle is given by s = x + r\u0302 uk /H, where r\u0302 is the unit vector pointing along the observer's line of\nsight, uk is the radial velocity, mp uk = qk = q * r\u0302, and H = aH, where H is the Hubble parameter.\nThen the mass density in redshift space is given by\nZ\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0010\nuk \u0011\nuk \u0011\n3\n3\nD\ns \u2212 x \u2212 r\u0302\n\u03c1s (s) = mp\nd x d q f (x, q) \u03b4\n= mp\nd3 q f s \u2212 r\u0302 , q .\n(2.2)\nH\nH\n\nBy Fourier transforming equation 2.2, we find\nZ\n\u03c1s (k) = mp\nd3 x d3 q f (x, q) eik*x+ikk uk /H\nZ\nZ\n= mp\nd3 x eik*x d3 q f (x, q) eikk uk /H ,\n\nwhere k is the wavevector in redshift space, corresponding to the redshift-space coordinate s.\nNow we expand the second integral in equation 2.3 as a Taylor series in kk uk /H,\nZ\nZ\nX 1\n\u0001L\nikk uk /H\nmp\nd3 q f (x, q) eikk uk /H = mp\nd3 q f (x, q)\nL!\nL=0\n\"\n#\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX 1 ikk L\nL\n= \u03c1\u0304\nTk (x) ,\nL! H\n\n(2.3)\n\n(2.4)\n\nL=0\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0304 is the mean mass density and\nTkL (x)\n\nmp\n=\n\u03c1\u0304\n\nZ\n\nd3 q f (x, q) uL\nk,\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fwhere in the last expression the integral over phase space assures that the quantity is defined in terms\nof a sum over all particles at position x. For a single stream at x this is just (1 + \u03b4(x))uL\nk (x). These\nare thus radial components of the moments of the distribution function and the distribution function\ndescription allows for inclusion of both bulk velocities and multi-streamed velocities. Note that these\nquantities are mass-weighted, and so well-defined for any system: one just sums over all the particles\nin the system weighting each one by the appropriate power of their radial velocities. If the field needs\nto be defined on a grid a simple assignment scheme of particles to the grid suffices, and empty grid\ncells are assigned a value of 0. We note this to contrast it with volume weighted quantities which need\nto be defined even if there are no particles assigned to a given grid cell, which is often impossible for\nsparse biased tracers, specially in underdense regions. We return to this issue later.\nThe Fourier component of the density fluctuation in redshift space is\nX 1 \u0012 ikk \u0013L\nTkL (k) ,\n\u03b4s (k) =\nL! H\n\n(2.6)\n\nL=0\n\nwhere TkL (k) is the Fourier transform of TkL (x).\nTkL (k) =\n\nZ\n\nd3 x TkL (x)eik*x .\n\n(2.7)\n\nFor L = 0 we have Tk0 (k) = \u03b4(k), the density fluctuation in real space.\n2.1\n\nAngular decomposition of moments of distribution function\n\nThe objects TkL (x) introduced in equation 2.5 are radial components of moments of the the distribution\nfunction, which are rank L tensors,\nZ\nmp\n(2.8)\nd3 q f (x, q) ui1 ui2 ...uiL .\nTiL1 ,i2 ,..iL =\n\u03c1\u0304\nThe real-space density field corresponds to L = 0, i.e. zeroth moment, the L = 1 moment corresponds\nto the momentum density, L = 2 gives the stress energy density tensor etc. These objects are\nsymmetric under exchange of any two indices and have (L + 1)(L + 2)/2 independent components.\nThey can be decomposed into helicity eigenstates under rotation around k, as we do next.\nSince translational symmetry guarantees that each Fourier mode is only correlated with itself,\nwe can work with each Fourier mode separately, and add them appropriately in the end when we\ndiscuss the power spectra. By symmetry we may take k to be along z-axis. We can decompose the\ndistribution function into spherical harmonics,\nf (k, q, \u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\n\u221e m=l\nX\nX\n\nflm (k, q)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\n(2.9)\n\nl=0 m=\u2212l\n\nq\n4\u03c0\nwhere q is the amplitude of the momentum (often a term (\u2212i)l 2l+1\nis inserted into this expansion,\nbut we will drop all such terms here). The components flm (k, q) are helicity eigenmodes (i.e., eigenmodes of angular momentum component in z-direction Lz = \u2212i\u2202/\u2202\u03c6) and under rotation by angle \u03c8\naround the z-axis they transform as\nflm (k, q)\u2032 = eim\u03c8 flm (k, q).\n\n(2.10)\n\nThis follows from the transformation properties of spherical harmonics. A quantity which transforms\nunder rotation according to this equation is said to have helicity m. A quantity with helicity 0 is\ncalled a scalar, that with helicity m = \u00b11 is called a vector and that with m = \u00b12 a tensor, but the\nexpansion goes to arbitrary values of m.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fMoments of the distribution function are defined in terms of integrals of velocity moments over\nthe distribution function. We can define helicity eigenstates of moments of the distribution function\nas\nZ\n4\u03c0mp\nL,m\nq 2 dquL flm (k, q).\n(2.11)\nTl (k) =\n\u03c1\u0304\n\nNote that each term TlL,m contains L powers of velocity u (u \u2261 |u|, and recall that q = mu).\nA general rank L tensor TiL1 ,i2 ,..iL can be decomposed into 2L + 1 helicity eigenmodes TLL,m\n(m = \u2212L, .., L) and additional components formed by a product of a scalar u2 with rank L \u2212 2\nL,m\ntensors. This gives additional 2(L \u2212 2) + 1 helicity eigenmodes TL\u22122\n(m = \u2212(L \u2212 2)..(L \u2212 2)), and\nadditional components formed again by u2 and rank L \u2212 4 tensor, which gives additional 2(L \u2212 4) + 1\nL,m\nhelicity eigenmodes TL\u22124\n(m = \u2212(L \u2212 4)..(L \u2212 4)) etc.\nFor the lowest terms we have rank 1 tensor Ti1 , momentum density, which is a 3-vector in the\nusual geometrical context, and can be decomposed into a m = 0 helicity scalar component T11,0\nand two m = \u00b11 helicity vector components T11,\u00b11 . A general symmetric rank 2 tensor Tij2 has 6\nindependent components. These can be decomposed into an isotropic rank 0 helicity scalar term\nT02,0 = (1 + \u03b4)u2 , which corresponds to the energy density, and 5 l = 2 components: one helicity\nscalar part of anisotropic stress tensor T22,0 , two helicity vector part of anisotropic stress tensor T22,\u00b11\nand two helicity tensor part of anisotropic stress tensor T22,\u00b12 . At L = 3 we have 10 independent\ncomponents, of which 7 are T33,m , i.e. l = 3, m = \u22123, .., 3, and 3 are T13,m , l = 1, m = \u22121, 0, 1\ntensors, formed by taking isotropic u2 and multiplying it with a 3-vector ui , the latter of which can\nbe decomposed into m = \u22121, 0, 1 components.\nOne can show that 2L+1+2(L\u22122)+1+2(L\u22124)+1+... = (L+1)(L+2)/2, so this decomposition\ngives the required number of independent components of a general symmetric tensor of rank L. In\nanalysis of general relativity it is customary to expand the metric and stress energy tensor into scalar\n(m = 0), vector (m = \u00b11) and tensor (m = \u00b12) helicity modes (SVT decomposition). No higher\norder helicity modes are needed, since only tensors of rank 0, 1 and 2 enter into the description of\nthe metric and energy momentum tensor. In contrast the moments of distribution function contain\ntensors of arbitrary rank and the expansion in equations 2.9,2.11 is the appropriate generalization of\nthe SVT decomposition.\nSo far we worked in the basis defined by k pointing in z direction. In general we are interested\nin computing the components of the moments in the radial direction r\u0302. If r\u0302 is parallel to k then only\nm = 0 components contribute, while for a general direction all of them do. The angular dependence of\nthe moments is obtained by performing a rotation of the basis from z||k to z \u2032 ||r\u0302. We can achieve this by\nrotating by \u03c6 around z and then by \u03b8 around the axis perpendicular to z, z \u2032 , so in terms of the general\n\u2032\nPm\nL,m\nl\nl\n\u2032\nrotation by 3 Euler angles we have TlL,m = \u2212m Dm,m\n, where Dm,m\n\u2032 (\u03c6, \u03b8, 0)Tl\n\u2032 (\u03c6, \u03b8, \u03c6 ) is the\n\u2032\ngeneral rotation matrix of spin l associated with the 3 Euler angles \u03c6, \u03b8, \u03c6 (we do not need to perform\nthe rotation around z \u2032 by \u03c6\u2032 ). Since uk is invariant under rotation around z \u2032 ||r\u0302 only m\u2032 = 0 survive.\np\nl\n4\u03c0/(2l + 1)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6).\nThe rotation matrix is given by the spherical harmonics, D0,m\n(\u03c6, \u03b8, 0) =\nCombining all together we find\nTkL (k) =\n\nX\n\nm=l\nX\n\nL,m\nnL\n(k)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6),\nl Tl\n\n(2.12)\n\n(l=L,L\u22122,..) m=\u2212l\n\nwhere NlL is a constant independent of angle whose numerical value will not be needed.\n\n3\n\nPower spectra\n\nWe will adopt a plane-parallel approximation, where only the angle between the line of sight and the\nFourier mode needs to be specified.

Note that PLL\u2032 (k) = PL\u2032 L (k)\u2217 so that the total result\nis real valued, as expected. Thus we only need to consider the terms PLL\u2032 (k) with L \u2264 L\u2032 , each of\nwhich comes with a factor of 2 if L 6= L\u2032 and 1 if L = L\u2032 .

Each term PLL\u2032 (k) contains products of multipole\nmoments\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nTlL,m Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6)[TlL\u2032 ,m Yl\u2032 m\u2032 (\u03b8, \u03c6)]\u2217 \u221d ei(m\u2212m )\u03c6 .\n(3.3)\nUpon averaging over the azimuthal angle \u03c6 of Fourier modes all the terms with m 6= m\u2032 vanish.\n\u2032\nAnother way to state this is that upon rotation by angle \u03a8 the correlators pick up a term ei(m\u2212m )\u03a8 ,\nand in order for the power spectrum to be rotationally invariant we require m = m\u2032 . Putting it all\ntogether we find\nPLL\u2032 (k) =\n\nX\n\nX\n\nl\nX\n\n\u2032\n\nL,L ,m\nPl,l\n(k)Plm (\u03bc)Plm\n\u2032 (\u03bc),\n\u2032\n\n(3.4)\n\n(l=L,L\u22122,..)

We\nabsorbed all of the terms that depend on l and m and various constants into the definition of power\nL,L\u2032 ,m\nspectra Pl,l\n(k), replaced the two helicity states \u00b1m by a single one with m > 0, since their \u03b8\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\nL,L ,m\nangular dependencies are the same, and we absorbed the factor of 2 into the definition of Pl,l\n(k).\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\nL,L ,m\nWe also require l\u2032 \u2265 l and absorb the factor of 2 into the definition of Pl,l\n(k) since the two terms\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\nL,L ,m\nhave the same angular structure. Note that due to statistical isotropy the spectra Pl,l\n(k) depend\n\u2032\nonly on amplitude of k, i.e. we have\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nL,L ,m\nPl,l\n(k) \u221d hTlL,m(k)(TlL\u2032 ,m (k))\u2217 i.\n\u2032\n\n(3.5)\n\nAll the angular structure is thus in associate Legendre polynomials Plm (\u03bc).\nEquations 3.2 and 3.4 are the main result of this paper. They show that there exists a well defined\nexpansion in terms of cross and auto-power spectra of velocity moments. The expansion parameter is\nroughly defined as k\u03bcu/H, where u is related to a typical gravitational velocity of the system (which\nshould be of the order of hundreds of km/s, but note that we take higher and higher powers of these\nvelocities in the series). The expansion is convergent if the expansion parameter is less than unity.\nIn terms of perturbation theory there is a close, but not one to one, relation between the lowest\norder of perturbation theory and the order of the moment expansion. Assuming \u03b4 and ku/H are\nof the same order, the lowest order of the contribution in terms of powers of power spectrum (i.e.,\nquadratic in \u03b4) is (L + L\u2032 )/2 if L + L\u2032 is even and L > 0, and (L + L\u2032 + 1)/2 if odd and L > 0, while\nfor L = 0 it is L\u2032 /2 + 1 if L\u2032 even or (L\u2032 + 1)/2 if L\u2032 odd, but of course all higher order terms also\nenter.\nThese equations also show that there is a close relation between the order of the moments\nand their angular dependence. To understand the angular dependence we first note that associated\nLegendre polynomial Plm (\u03bc) contains powers from 1 to \u03bcl\u2212m for even l, and from \u03bc to \u03bcl\u2212m , for odd l,\nL,L\u2032 ,m\nand is always multiplied with a power of (1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )m/2 . Thus Pl,l\n(k) gets multiplied with powers of\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2 m\n2 m\nl+l\u2032 \u22122m\n2 m\n(1 \u2212 \u03bc ) or \u03bc(1 \u2212 \u03bc ) to \u03bc\n(1 \u2212 \u03bc ) , so the highest order is \u03bcl+l . In addition we have \u03bcL+L\n\u2032\ndependence in equation 3.2, so the lowest contribution in powers of \u03bc to P ss (k) is \u03bcL+L if L + L\u2032 is\n\u2032\n\u2032\neven or \u03bcL+L +1 if L + L\u2032 is odd, and the highest is \u03bc2(L+L ) . Thus for P00 (k) the only angular term\nis isotropic, for P01 (k) the only angular term is \u03bc2 , P11 (k) and P02 (k) contain both \u03bc2 and \u03bc4 etc.\nNote that only even powers of \u03bc enter in the final expression, as required by the symmetry. We now\nproceed to look in more detail at the lowest order terms.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\f3.1\n\nP00 (k): the isotropic term\n\nAt the lowest order in the expansion we have correlation of real space density T||0 = \u03b4(k) with itself.\n000\nDensity is a scalar of rank 0, P0 (\u03bc) = 1. The power spectrum is isotropic P00 (k) = P00\n(k). This\nterm is just the real space power spectrum and of course does not have any \u03bc dependence since it is\nindependent of redshift space distortions. For small values of \u03bc this term always dominates, and in\nthe limit \u03bc = 0 the transverse power spectrum becomes the real power spectrum P00 (k). The real\nspace power spectrum agrees with the linear one on large scales, P00 (k) = Plin (k), slightly dips below\nthe linear one around k \u223c 0.1h/M pc, while on even smaller scales the nonlinear corrections cause it\nto increase over the linear one.\n3.2\n\nP01 (k)\n\nAt the next order in our expansion (not in perturbation theory PT, see below) we have correlations\nbetween the density T||0 (k) = \u03b4(k) and radial component of momentum density T||1 (k) = [(1+\u03b4)u|| ](k).\nMomentum density can be decomposed into a scalar (m = 0) T11,0 and two vector (m = \u00b11) components T11,\u00b11 , but only the scalar part correlates with the density T00,0 , which is a scalar. Thus the\n0,1,0\nonly contribution comes from P0,1\n(k) \u221d hT00,0 (k)(T11,0 (k))\u2217 i,\n0,1,0\nP01 (k) = P0,1\n(k)\u03bc,\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere we used P10 (\u03bc) = \u03bc.\nThe scalar mode of momentum can be obtained from the divergence of momentum and related\nto \u03b4\u0307 using the continuity equation, which in terms of our quantities is\n\u1e6a00,0 + ikT11,0 = 0.\n\n(3.7)\n\nThis is an exact relation (for conserved quantities), in the sense that the vector part of momentum\ndoes not contribute to it, since it vanishes upon taking the divergence (i.e., vector components are\northogonal to k and the dot product is zero).\nFrom this we get that\nP01 (k) = \u2212ik \u22121 \u03bcP\u03b4,\u03b4\u0307 (k) = \u2212\n\ni\u03bc dP00 (k)\n.\n2k dt\n\n(3.8)\n\nThe total contribution from this term to P ss (k) is\nss\nP01\n(k) = \u03bc2 H\u22121\n\ndP00 (k)\ndP00 (k)\n= \u03bc2\n.\nd\u03c4\nd ln a\n\n(3.9)\n\nThis is an exact relation for dark matter, valid also in the nonlinear regime. It shows that this term\ncan be obtained directly from the redshift evolution of the dark matter power spectrum P00 (k). On\nlarge scales it agrees with the linear theory predictions. If we write P00 (k) = D(a)2 Plin (k), with D(a)\nss\nthe linear growth rate and f = d ln D/d ln a, then we find P01\n(k) = 2f \u03bc2 Plin (k). We thus see that\nthis order is of the same order in PT as the first order P00 (k), the well known Kaiser result [2]. On\nsmaller scales we expect the term to deviate from the linear one, just as for P00 (k).\n3.3\n\nP11 (k)\n\nThe next term is the correlation of the momentum density T||1 (k) with itself. In this case the scalar\n(m = 0) T11,0 (k) correlates with itself and the vector (m = \u00b11) components T11,\u00b11 (k) also correlate\nwith itself, so both components of momentum contribute,\n1,1,1\n1,1,0\nP11 (k) = P1,1\n(k)[P10 (\u03bc)]2 + P1,1\n(k)[P11 (\u03bc)]2 .\n\n(3.10)\n\nIn terms of the contribution to the redshift space power spectrum this gives\n1,1,0\n1,1,1\nss\nP11\n(k) = H\u22122 k 2 \u03bc2 [P1,1\n(k)\u03bc2 + P1,1\n(k)(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 )].\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n(3.11)\n\n\fThe scalar part of the momentum is the one that contributes to the continuity equation 3.7. In linear\n1,1,0\nperturbation theory only the scalar contribution is non-zero and P1,1\n(k) = f 2 Plin (k). This term is\nalso of linear order and collecting all terms at this order we obtain the usual expression [2]\nss\nPlin\n(k) = (1 + f \u03bc2 )2 Plin (k).\n\n(3.12)\n\nHowever, we see from the above that there will be another contribution to both \u03bc2 and \u03bc4 terms\n1,1,1\nfrom the vector part of momentum correlator P1,1\n(k) \u221d h|T111 (k)|2 i, which comes in at the second\norder in power spectrum. This vector part is often called the vorticity part of the momentum. In\ngeneral this term is non-zero because vorticity of momentum does not vanish, even if vorticity of\nvelocity vanishes for a single streamed fluid [16]. As seen from equation 3.11 this term always adds\npower to \u03bc2 term and subtracts it in \u03bc4 term (but is combined with a positive contribution from the\nscalar part in \u03bc4 term).\n3.4\n\nP02 (k)\n\nAt orders higher than P11 (k) we no longer have any linear contributions, hence these terms are usually\nnot of interest for extracting the cosmological information. However, these terms, including what is\nsometimes called the Fingers-of-God (FoG) effect, are known to be important on fairly large scales.\nHere we will limit the discussion to some general statements of their k and \u03bc dependence, leaving\ntheir more precise calculations to future work.\nThere are two different terms that contribute to this term,\n0,2,0\n0,2,0\n(k)P00 (\u03bc)P20 (\u03bc).\n(k)[P00 (\u03bc)]2 + P0,2\nP02 (k) = P0,0\n\n(3.13)\n\nIn terms of the contribution to the redshift space power spectrum this gives\nss\nP02\n(k) = \u2212\n\n\u0012\n\nk\u03bc\nH\n\n\u00132 \u0014\n\n\u0015\n1 0,2,0\n0,2,0\nP0,0\n(k) + P0,2\n(k)(3\u03bc2 \u2212 1) .\n2\n\n(3.14)\n\nThe first term is the correlation between the isotropic part of the mass weighted square of velocity,\ni.e. the energy density, T02,0 = (1 + \u03b4)u2 and the density field T00,0 = \u03b4. The second term comes from\nthe scalar part of the anisotropic stress T22,0 correlated with the density T00,0 = \u03b4.\nOn physical grounds we expect the first term to be large in systems with a large rms velocity\n0,2,0\nresulting in a term scaling as P0,0\n(k) \u223c P00 (k)\u03c3 2 , where \u03c3 2 has units of velocity squared, but is\nnot simply the volume averaged velocity squared (see below). The contribution of this term to P ss\ngoes as \u2212(k\u03bc/H)2 \u03c3 2 P00 (k), i.e. it is a damping term suppressing the linear power spectrum, with\nthe effect increasing towards higher k (smaller scales). This is the lowest order FoG term, which we\nsee contributes as (k\u03bc)2 dependence and so affects the \u03bc2 term. It is a damping term that is always\nnegative, while the corresponding \u03bc2 term from P11 always adds power. The scalar anisotropic stress0,2,0\ndensity correlator P0,2\n(k) also contributes to \u03bc2 angular term, as well as to \u03bc4 angular term, and is\n0,2,0\nformally of the same order in perturbation theory as P0,0\n(k), but is likely to be smaller on physical\ngrounds that velocity dispersion in virialized objects is isotropic and hence has a small anisotropic\nstress.\n3.5\n\nP03 (k), P12 (k), P04 (k), P13 (k) and P22 (k)\n\nSince the lowest order in \u03bc is (L + L\u2032 ) or L + L\u2032 + 1, the terms of order higher than P02 (k) do not\ncontribute to \u03bc2 term. At the next order in \u03bc we have terms of order \u03bc4 . At this order there are\n7 terms that contribute. P11 (k) and P02 (k) we already discussed: while P11 (k) has a linear order\nterm and is expected to dominate on large scales, P02 (k) is second order in power spectrum. They\nboth come with a prefactor of k 2 . At the next order we have P03 (k) and P12 (k), both second order\nin power spectrum and each multiplied by k 3 , followed by P13 (k) and P22 (k), also second order in\npower spectrum, but each multiplied by k 4 , and by P04 (k), third order in power spectrum. All of\nthese terms also contribute to terms of higher order in \u03bc2j , up to \u03bc6 or \u03bc8 for these terms.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fOne can see from this discussion that the angular structure of higher order terms is considerably\nmore complex than that of lower order terms and that all the terms even in powers of \u03bc are being\ngenerated by RSD. However, there is a connection between the angular order, powers of k and lowest\norder in perturbation theory, such that only the low powers of k and low lowest order of PT contribute\nto the lowest orders in \u03bc. Thus, at low values of k\u03bc, the series is convergent. To make these statements\nmore quantitative a numerical or perturbative analysis is required, which will be presented elsewhere\n[17].\n3.6\n\nShot noise and connections between the correlators\n\nThe correlators at the same order in powers of velocity, i.e. equal L + L\u2032 , contain nontrivial cancellations among them. To see this assume velocity is constant over a region of space r \u223c k0\u22121 . For\nexample, large scale bulk flows lead to correlated velocities on small scales, giving rise to nearly equal\nvelocities between nearby particles. On scales smaller than this velocity coherence scale, k > k0 , we\ncan pull out these constant velocity terms from the correlators, to obtain\n\u2032\n\nL+L\nL \u2217 \u2032\ni\u03b4D (k \u2212 k\u2032 ),\nPLL\u2032 (k)\u03b4D (k \u2212 k\u2032 ) = h[(1 + \u03b4)uL\nk ](k)[(1 + \u03b4)uk ] (k )i \u223c P00 (k)huk\n\n(3.15)\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere hukL+L i is just a number corresponding to the spatial average of this term. So these terms are\nall equal as long as L + L\u2032 is the same.\nThese terms enter into the sum in equation 3.1 with different prefactors and opposite signs,\nleading to cancellations between them. The lowest order example is that of P11 and P02 , which enter\nwith equal prefactors but opposite signs, canceling any such contributions from each other. This is\nnot surprising: bulk flows lead to \"rigid body\" displacements of particles but do not contribute to\nFoG effects, so their contribution to P02 must be canceled. As a result, only velocity dispersion type\ncontributions lead to FoG effects.\nIn the extreme case this argument can be applied to the shot noise for these correlators, which\nis the contribution to the power spectrum caused by discreteness of tracers. It is well known that\nthe shot noise of a density field sampled by tracers of number density n\u0304 is given by P00 (k) = n\u0304\u22121 .\nAnalogous calculation for the moments gives\n\u2032\n\nPLL\u2032 (k) = n\u0304\u22121 hukL+L i.\n\n(3.16)\n\nThis expression is exact, since by definition a discrete tracer population only has a single value of\n\u2032\nvelocity at any given position, so hukL+L i will be the same for any pair of L, L\u2032 such that L + L\u2032 is\nthe same. These shot noise terms can be large if the tracer is sparse, i.e. if n\u0304 is small. However, the\nargument above shows that these terms enter with opposiste signs in the final result and so these shot\nnoise contributions cancel in the total sum of 3.1. This is expected: the only shot noise contribution\nto the total RSD power spectrum P ss (k) should be n\u0304\u22121 . These examples show that these velocity\nmoments are connected, and it is more natural to consider them together, such as P11 (k) \u2212 P02 (k),\nwhere the shot noise and the bulk flow terms cancel out.\n3.7\n\nRelation to Legendre moments\n\nIn RSD analyses it is customary to integrate P ss (k) over the lowest order Legendre polynomials to\nobtain moments Plss (k),\nZ 1\nP ss (k)Pl (\u03bc)d\u03bc,\n(3.17)\nPlss (k) = (2l + 1)\n0\n\nwhere Pl (\u03bc) are the ordinary Legendre polynomials, P0 (\u03bc) = 1, P2 (\u03bc) = (3\u03bc2 \u2212 1)/2 and P4 (\u03bc) =\n(35\u03bc4 \u2212 30\u03bc2 + 3)/8. Only the lowest 3 orders contain contributions from linear terms, so the analysis\nis usually limited to l = 0, 2, 4. The 0 moment is just the spherical average of the power spectrum\nin redshift space. The advantage of this expansion is that in a typical survey the moments are\nuncorrelated on scales small compared to the size of the survey.\nMoments in even l can be viewed as an alternative way to expand in terms of even powers of\n\u03bc. However, the expansion given in equation 3.4 is not an expansion in Legendre polynomials, since\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fit contains products of associated Legendre polynomials (including squares of ordinary Legendre\npolynomials of both even and odd orders). Hence there is no orthogonality between the moments\nof distribution function and Legendre moments Plss (k). So if we expand the angular dependence of\nss\n\u2032\nany given term PLL\n\u2032 (k) into Legendre polynomials, we will generate all orders up to l = 2(L + L ).\nss\nThis means for example that all terms will contribute to the monopole l = 0, all except P00 (k) to\nss\nss\nquadrupole l = 2 and all but P00\n(k) and P10\n(k) to hexadecupole l = 4. As a result we always have an\ninfinite number of terms PLL\u2032 (k) contributing to any given Legendre series term Plss (k), with higher\nand higher powers of k. This expansion is thus considerably more complex than the expansion in\npowers of \u03bc2j , which has a finite number of terms for any given value of j.\nThe discussion above suggests it may be more beneficial to fit for powers of \u03bc2j rather than for\nLegendre moments, for example by fitting for \u03bc0 , \u03bc2 and \u03bc4 terms, which contain linear order contributions, together with higher order terms \u03bc6 , \u03bc8 etc., which we do not care for and can marginalize\nover in the end. However, Legedre moments are uncorrelated while powers of \u03bc2j are strongly correlated, so a marginalization over higher order terms will lead to a large increase in errors for higher\nk, given that these terms become very large at high k compared to lowe order terms. So this can\nonly work if sufficiently strong priors are adopted for higher order terms \u03bc6 , \u03bc8 etc. Such priors could\ncome from simulations extracting individual higher order terms or from a parametrized model. This\nis pursued further in [17].\n3.8\n\nApplications to galaxies and issues of bias\n\nThe relation to other tracers such as galaxies is a rich subject worth exploring further with this method.\nIn this paper we focus primarily on the dark matter, but all the derivations remain unchanged if the\ndark matter particles are replaced with some other tracers, such as galaxies or halos. In large scale\nstructure we usually define bias as the ratio of galaxy power spectrum (shot noise subtracted) to\ngg\nmm\n(k)/P00\n(k). We can generalize the concept of bias to\nmatter power spectrum, b2 (k) = P00\nbLL\u2032 (k) =\n\ngg\nPLL\n\u2032 (k)\n,\nmm\nPLL\u2032 (k)\n\n(3.18)\n\ngg\nmm\nwhere PLL\n\u2032 (k) is galaxy correlator and PLL\u2032 (k) is the corresponding dark matter term. In linear\n2\ntheory we have b00 = b1 , b01 = b1 and b11 = 1, independent of scale or angle, where linear bias\nis defined as \u03b4g = b1 \u03b4m . Two ways to extract cosmological information from RSD are either by\ncombining P00 and P01 to eliminate b1 , or to use P11 directly.\nBefore discussing RSD further it is useful to draw a comparison to weak lensing. In case of weak\nlensing we can measure both projected dark matter density or galaxy density, so we can perform a\njoint correlation analysis of galaxy clustering and weak lensing, where the galaxy auto-correlation is\nproportional to b2 times matter correlations, cross-correlation between galaxies and weak lensing signal\naround them induced by the dark matter is proportional to b (the so called galaxy-galaxy lensing),\nwhile the weak lensing auto-correlation is independent of bias. Two ways to extract the signal are\neither using just shear-shear correlations tracing matter-matter correlations, or combining galaxy\nauto-correlation with galaxy-galaxy lensing to eliminate bias. This latter has higher signal to noise\nbut is complicated due to the fact that bias is scale independent and the scale dependence depends\non the galaxy properties [18]. To understand when this happens it is useful to expand galaxy density\n2\nperturbation to second order in matter density, \u03b4g = b1 \u03b4m +b2 \u03b4m\n. The second order terms will become\nimportant when they cannot be neglected against the first order terms, so the expansion parameter\nrms\nis (b2 /b1 )\u03b4m . Since \u03b4m\nincreases on small scales this scale dependent bias increases towards small\nscales. Typically we have |b2 /b1 | < 0.4 [18] and the corrections become important at k \u223c 0.1h/M pc,\nrms\nwhere \u03b4m\n\u223c 0.5.\nReturning back to RSD, our formalism is directly applicable to galaxies, except that all the\nvelocity moments are mass weighted for the dark matter, TkL,m = (1 + \u03b4m )uL\nk , and number density\n\nweighted for the galaxies, TkL,g = (1 + \u03b4g )uL\nk . What this shows is that if the density distribution\nof galaxies differs from that of the dark matter then all the correlators of velocity moments will\ndiffer from each other, even those that appear independent of bias, such as P11 . In reality thus the\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fpredictions of linear bias model will be modified, because even if galaxies are faithful tracers of the\ndark matter velocities at a given position, the weighting of the velocity moments differs: in one case\nthey are weighted by the dark matter mass, in the other by the number of galaxies, and the two differ\nin their spatial distribution. This will result in scale dependence of the higher order bias terms bLL\u2032 ,\njust like it does for the b00 itself [19].\nTo quantify this further, for the lowest order momentum density term and for linear bias we must\ngg\ngg\ncompare correlation of (1 + b1 \u03b4m )uk with itself to give P11\n(k) or with b1 \u03b4m to give P01\n(k). The autocorrelation will give the result that agrees with the dark matter only for b1 = 1, or if b1 \u03b4m \u226a 1. In the\nsame limit the cross-correlation will give linear bias b1 . So momentum density becomes velocity in the\nlimit b1 \u03b4m \u226a 1, while requiring it to be scale independent relative to dark matter requires something\nlike (b1 \u2212 1)\u03b4m \u226a 1, which for typical LRG galaxies (b1 \u223c 2) is in fact a more stringent requirement\nthan that of a scale independent bias condition discussed above (b2 /b1 versus b1 ). This suggests that\nthe scale dependence of the momentum density bias terms b01 and b11 defined in equation 3.18 extends\nto larger scales than scale dependent bias of density b00 .\nThe conclusion from this discussion is that the scale dependence of bias terms involving momentum density is a real concern in RSD and likely extends to relatively large scales (k < 0.1h/M pc). In\nterms of the angular decomposition in powers of \u03bc, the discussion of the scale dependent bias of RSD\ncan be divided into a \u03bc2 term, which depends entirely on b01 in P01 , and the \u03bc4 term, for which the\nscale dependence of b11 term above is applicable, since that is the term that does not vanish on large\nscales in linear theory. In this sense RSD analysis is not the equivalent of a joint galaxy-weak lensing\nanalysis, since weak lensing auto-correlation truly traces the dark matter directly, while in RSD this\nlimit is achieved only on relatively large scales where \u03b4grms \u226a 1.\nThe discussion so far completely ignored FoG effects: for \u03bc2 term these are encoded in P02 and\nin vector part of P11 , which unlike P02 adds power rather than removes it, and these terms have their\nown physical interpretation and scale dependence unrelated to the scale dependent bias discussion\nabove. While they can partially cancel the effects discussed above they are unlikely to achieve this\nexactly. In most of the literature so far only the scale dependence induced by FoG effects was discussed\n(although see [7, 12]). The simple linear bias model predicts that FoG effects scale with bias squared:\ngg\ngg\n\u221d [b1 \u03b4vk ]2 . If we\n\u221d h[b1 \u03b4vk2 ](k)b1 \u03b4(\u2212k) and in P11\nthe leading order term scales as b21 both in P02\ngg\ngg\ngg\ngg\nmm\nwrite P02 (k) \u2212 P11 (k) = P00 (k)\u03c3 2 , then \u03c3 is independent of bias, since P00 (k) \u221d b21 P00\n(k).\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper we present a distribution function approach to redshift space distortions. We show that\nthe redshift space density can be expressed in terms of a sum over velocity moments and the redshift\nspace power spectrum can be expressed in terms of correlators between the Fourier components of\nthese moments. These moments are simple objects to calculate in any system: they are calculated by\nsimply taking appropriate powers of radial velocity and summing over all particles. The lowest order\nmoments are density, momentum density, stress energy density etc.\nWe have decomposed the moments into helicity eigenstates based on their transformation properties under rotation around the direction of the Fourier mode, a generalization of SVT decomposition\nin cosmological perturbation theory. We use rotational invariance to derive all of the allowed correlator terms, showing that only terms with the same helicity can contribute to the correlators. The\nmoments of distribution function are complicated objects with many terms allowed by symmetries,\nspecially at higher order, leading to a complicated angular and scale dependence, suggesting that\ntreatments of RSD cannot be fully successful with simple ansatzes, such as the popular FoG velocity\ndispersion model with one free parameter [10, 11].\nDespite the complexity of the general RSD description some general statements can be made.\nThe lower order terms generally only contribute to low orders of expansion in \u03bc2 , where \u03bc is the angle\nbetween the Fourier mode and the line of sight. As an example, we have shown that only the scalar\npart of the momentum density correlates with the density, and this term can be written in terms of\na time derivative of the power spectrum. This term only contributes to \u03bc2 angular dependence and\ncontains a linear order term. But there is also the vector part of the momentum density-momentum\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fdensity correlation, the (scalar) energy density-density correlation, and the scalar part of anisotropic\nstress density-density correlation, all of which also contribute to the \u03bc2 term. They are all nonlinear\nand cannot dominate on very large scales, but likely dominate on small scales. The energy densitydensity correlation term is the term most closely related to the FoG velocity dispersion effect and\nis always negative, suppressing the power, but the other terms are formally of the same order in\nperturbation theory. We have shown that the vorticity part of momentum always adds to the RSD\npower of \u03bc2 term, and hence acts in the opposite direction to the FoG term. Our analysis cannot\naddress which term has a larger amplitude, but it would be interesting to see if there are any systems\nwhere the terms that add power dominate over those that suppress it. The next angular term has \u03bc4\ndependence and we identified 7 terms that contribute to it, of which one, scalar part of P11 , contains\na linear contribution that does not vanish on large scales.\nThe fact that there are a finite number of velocity moment terms at each order of \u03bc2j expansion\nshould be contrasted to the popular Legendre multipoles expansion (monopole, quadrupole and hexadecupole contain cosmological information), which receive contributions from all orders in moments\nof distribution function. This suggests that a better behaved analysis may be possible if instead of\na multipole analysis the analysis is performed in terms of a \u03bc2j expansion, with the lowest 3 orders\ncontaining cosmological information and the rest treated as nuisance parameters.\nIt is important to emphasize that these moments are mass weighted quantities, and no volume\naveraged quantities ever enter into our expressions. This relates to one of the long standing issues\nin the treatment of RSD: many of the past treatments [10, 11, 20] have assumed that RSD trace\ncorrelations between velocities and dark matter and that the FoG effects multiply these densityvelocity and velocity-velocity correlations, where FoG quantities are also defined as volume weighted\nquantities such as velocity dispersion \u03c3 2 = hu2 i. But these volume weighted quantities are not well\ndefined, specially for sparse biased systems such as galaxies or clusters. For a biased tracer with b > 1\none finds that voids with no tracers in them are enlarged, since, for \u03b4 < 0, 1 + b\u03b4 is closer to 0 than\n1 + \u03b4. This has forced some workers to use the dark matter velocity field instead, with unpredictable\nresults [11]. Our expansion shows that it is more natural to define RSD in terms of mass or number\nweighted quantities, such as momentum density or energy density, the former replacing velocity and\nthe latter replacing velocity dispersion. Mass and number weighted moments such as momentum or\nenergy density are well defined even in voids (where they are simply zero). In this paper we show that\nthere is a consistent expansion using mass weighted moments, and that the expansion is convergent\non large scales.\nThe fact that all RSD quantities are density weighted also suggests that RSD effects will differ\nif the galaxy number density distribution differs from mass density distribution. We have shown that\neven a linear bias model induces scale dependent bias of the momentum density correlators, and that\nthis scale dependence is likely to show up on relatively large scales, k < 0.1h/Mpc. The success of\nRSD in extracting cosmological information depends entirely on our ability to model these various\nbias terms and relate them to each other. Similarly, the success of the approach presented here in\nmodeling RSD depends on our ability to extract these moments from simulations and data and on\nour ability to model them with analytic models, such as perturbation theory. Providing physical\ninterpretation of the terms, as done here, could enable one to develop more effective modeling, or\nprovide a better physical understanding of limitations of RSD in extracting cosmological information.\nFor example, it is relatively straight-forward to include the bias induced scale dependence effect at\nthe lowest order of PT and we will present the results elsewhere [21]. In this paper we have focused on\ntheory, conceptual issues and general symmetries, while applications to simulations and perturbation\ntheory will be presented in upcoming work [17, 21].\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Teppei Okumura and Zvonimir Vlah for helpful discussions.
