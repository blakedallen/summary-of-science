Two regimes are well-known: the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of\nbound states with an even number of Fermions and the condensation of bosonic\ncorrelations (e.g., Cooper pairs) in the continuum of unbound states according\nto the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. While the former mechanism\nconcerns states which are well-localized in coordinate space as they occur for\nstrong enough attractive coupling, the latter mechanism applies to states which\nare correlated within a shell of the order of the energy gap \u2206 around the Fermi\nsphere in momentum space but delocalized in coordinate space. The transition between both regimes is called BEC-BCS crossover. Recently, this transition regime became accessible to laboratory experiments with ultracold gases\nof fermionic atoms coupled via Feshbach resonances with a strength tunable by\napplying external magnetic fields, see Fig. 1. After the preparation of fermionic\ndimers in 2003, now also the BEC [1, 2] and superfluidity of these dimers has\nbeen observed [3, 4]. The BEC-BCS crossover is physically related [5] to the\nbound state dissociation or Mott-Anderson delocalization transition [6] where\nthe modification of the effective coupling strength is caused by electronic screening and/or Pauli blocking effects [7]. It is thus a very general effect expected to\n1\n\n\fg gc\n\ng~gc\n\ng>> gc\n\n>>\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the transition from BCS pairing with delocalized wave\nfunctions to BEC of bound states, well-localized in coordinate space, from Ref.\n[14]\noccur in a wide variety of dense Fermi systems with attractive interactions [8]\nsuch as electron-hole systems in solid state physics [9], electron-proton systems\nin the interior of giant planets [10], deuterons in nuclear matter [11] or diquarks\nin quark matter [12]. The BEC-BCS crossover transition in quark matter is of\nparticular theoretical interest due to the additional relativistic regime [13].\nA systematic treatment of these effects is possible within the path integral\nformulation for finite-temperature quantum field theories. This approach is\nrather general as it is relativistic and is especially suited to take into account the\neffects of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Within these lectures we will present\nthe basics of this approach on the example of a model field theory of the Nambu\u2013\nJona-Lasinio type for a relativistic strongly interacting Fermi system. These\ninvestigations are also motivated by the analogies of the strongly coupled quarkgluon plasma (sQGP) at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in Brookhaven\n[15] with the experiments on BEC of atoms in traps. Furthermore, qualiative\ninsights into possible effects observable in the upcoming CBM experiment at\nFAIR Darmstadt as well as from neutron stars with quark matter interiors\ncould be derived along the lines of this approach.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nPath integral formalism\nPartition function and model Lagrangian\n\nAs a generic model system for the description of hot, dense Fermi-systems with\nstrong, short-range interactions we consider quark matter described by a model\nLagrangian with four-fermion coupling. The key quantity for the derivation of\nthermodynamic properties is the partition function Z from which all thermodynamic quantities can be derived. It is given as a path integral which in the\nimaginary time formalism (t = \u2212i\u03c4 ) can be expressed as [16]\nZ\nR\u03b2 4\n\u2020\nZ = D(iq \u2020 )D(q) e d x (L\u2212\u03bcq q) ,\n(1)\n2\n\n\fwhere the chemical potential \u03bc is introduced as a Lagrange multiplier for assuring conservation of baryon number as a conserved charge carried by the quarks.\nR\u03b2 4\nR\u03b2\nR\nThe notation\nd x is shorthand for 0 d\u03c4 d3 x where \u03b2 = 1/T is the inverse\ntemperature. The quark matter is described by a Dirac Lagrangian with internal\ndegrees of freedom (Nf = 2 flavors , Nc = 3 colors), with a current-current-type\nfour-fermion interaction inspired by one-gluon exchange\nL = q\u0304(i\u2202/ \u2212 m0 )q \u2212\n\n8\n\u03bba\ng 2 X \u03bba\nq\u0304 \u03b3\u03bc q q\u0304 \u03b3 \u03bc q ,\n2 a=1 2\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bba are the Gell-Mann matrices for color SU (3). After Fierz transformation of the interaction, we select scalar diquark channel and the scalar and\npseudoscalar channel so that our model Lagrangian assumes the form\nL = L0 + Lqq + Lqq\u0304\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the different terms are given by\nL0\nLqq\u0304\nLqq\n\n= q\u0304(i\u2202/ \u2212 m0 )q\ni\nh\n2\n2\n= GS (q\u0304q) + (q\u0304i\u03b35 \u03c4 q)\n\b\n\b\n= GD q\u0304 [i\u03b35 C\u03c42 \u03bb2 ] q\u0304 T q T [iC\u03b35 \u03c42 \u03bb2 ] q ,\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b3\u03bd are the Dirac matrices, \u03c4i are SU (2) flavor matrices and C = i\u03b3 2 \u03b3 0\nis the charge conjugation matrix. GS and GD are the coupling strengths corresponding to the different channels, see Ref. [17] for a recent review. For the numerical analysis we adopt parameters from Ref. [18] and consider \u03b7D = GD /GS\nas a free parameter of the model.\nA general method to deal with four-fermion interactions in the path integral\napproach starts with the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation [19] of the partition function to its equivalent form in terms of collective bosonic fields, which\nis more suitable to deal with nonperturbative effects such as the occurrence of\norder parameters related to phase transitions in the system as well as collective\nexcitations (plasmons = mesons and pairs = diquarks) in these phases.\n\n2.2\n\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformation: Bosonization\n\nThe Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation is a two-step procedure which consists of (1) linearization of the four-fermion interaction terms by introducing\nbosonic auxiliary fields in the appropriate channels and (2) integrating out the\nfermions analytically.\nWe introduce the Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary fields \u2206(\u03c4, x), \u2206\u2217 (\u03c4, x),\n\u03c0(\u03c4, x) and \u03c3(\u03c4, x) so that the partition function of the system becomes\n\u001a R \u03b2 4 h \u03c32 +\u03c02 |\u2206|2 i\nZ\n\u2212\nd x 4G + 4G\nS\nD\nZ =\nD\u2206\u2217 D\u2206D\u03c3D\u03c0 e\n(7)\n\u001b\nZ\nR\u03b2 4\nT\n\u2206\u2217 T\n\u2206\n/\n\u00d7 [dq] [dq\u0304] e d x(q\u0304(i\u2202+\u03bc\u03b30 \u2212m0 )q\u2212q\u0304(\u03c3+i\u03b35 \u03c4 *\u03c0)q\u2212 2 q Rq\u2212 2 q\u0304 R\u0303q\u0304 ) .\n3\n\n\fwhere R = iC\u03b35 \u2297 \u03c42 \u2297 \u03bb2 , R\u0303 = i\u03b35 C \u2297 \u03c42 \u2297 \u03bb2 .

It is characterized by the coexistence of diquark condensation with chiral\nsymmetry breaking.\n6\n\n\f\u2022 \u2206 = 0, m \u223c m0 : normal phase (NQM)\n\u2022 \u2206 6= 0, m \u223c m0 : color superconductor (2SC)\n\u2022 \u2206 = 0, m \u226b m0 : chiral symmetry broken phase (\u03c7SB)\n\u2022 \u2206 6= 0, m \u226b m0 : coexistence of \u03c7SB and 2SC (BEC phase)\nOrder parameters are indicators of phase transitions. The phase transitions can\nbe classified according to their order, depending on the behavior of the order\nparameters with the change of thermodynamic variables\n\u2022 first order: order parameter jumps, as in the case of the \u03c7SB \u2192 2SC phase\ntransition at not too large coupling.\n\u2022 second order: order parameter turns continuously to zero. The 2SC \u2192\nNQM transition with increasing T is always second order. The \u03c7SB \u2192\n2SC transition turns from 1st to 2nd order for strong enough coupling.\n\u2022 crossover: the order parameter changes continuously, but does not go to\nzero and also has no jumps. An example is the \u03c7SB \u2192 NQM transition at\ntemperatures above the critical endpoint (CP) where it goes over to the\nline of 1st order transitions in the T \u2212 \u03bc plane. The identification of the\nCP is a key issue for experimental research and thus for the verification\nof QCD models. It is suggested that verifiable signatures (change of the\nfluctuation spectrum, latent heat or not) are related with it. For strong\ncoupling, the CP moves to lower T and finally to T = 0 (for \u03b7D > 1.3 the\nchiral transition is always crossover).\nIncreasing the diquark coupling \u03b7D leads to an increase of the diquark gap\nand therefore a rise in the critical temperature for the second order transition to\na normal quark matter phase. It shifts also the border between color superconductivity (2SC) and chiral symmetry broken phase (\u03c7SB) to lower values of the\nchemical potential. For very strong coupling \u03b7D \u223c 1, a coexistence region developes, where both order parameters are simultaneously nonvanishing. Under\nthese conditions, the phase border is not of first order and therefore no critical\nendpoint can be identified. As we are going to explain in the next section, in the\n\u03c7SB phase pion and diquark bound states can exist. At the chiral symmetry\nrestoration transition, they merge the continuum of unbound states and turn\ninto (resonant) scattering states. When this Mott transition occurs within the\n2SC phase (characterized by a nonvanishing diquark condensate) we speak of\na BEC-BCS crossover: the condensation of diquark bound states (BEC) turns\ninto a condensation of resonances, called Cooper pairs (BCS).\nFor lower coupling, the critical point occurs and is shown as a colored dot\nin the phase diagram of Fig. 3.\nIn the next section we will turn towards the interesting question about the\nquasiparticle excitations in these phases. To this end, we will expand the action\nfunctional in the partition function up to quadratic (Gaussian) order in the\nmesonic fields and arrive at a tractable approximation for the bosonized quark\nmatter model (11).\n7\n\n\f2.5\n\nGaussian fluctuations: bound & scattering states\n\nLet us expand now the mesonic fields around their mean field values. In these\nlectures, we will focus on fluctuations in the mesonic channels, where the pion\nand the sigma meson will emerge as quasiparticle degrees of freedom. On the\nexample of the pion we will explain the physics of the Mott transition. As\ndiscussed in the previous section, the phenomenon of the BEC-BCS crossover\nin the 2SC phase is due to the Mott transition for diquarks. The detailed\ninvestigation of the quantized diquark fluctuations, which are also a prerequisite\nof the formation of baryons, will be given elsewhere [?, 20]. As we already\nnoticed, the pion does not contribute to the mean field, and we need to introduce\nonly the sigma-field fluctuations as \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3MF + \u03c3. Hence it is possible to\ndecompose the inverse propagator S \u22121 into a mean field part and a fluctuation\n\u22121\npart S \u22121 = SMF\n+ \u03a3 , where the matrix \u03a3 is defined as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2212\u03c3 \u2212 i\u03b35~\u03c4 * ~\u03c0\n0\n\u03a3\u2261\n.\n(19)\n0\n\u2212\u03c3 \u2212 i\u03b35~\u03c4 t * ~\u03c0\nIn the Gaussian approximation the fermion determinant becomes\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\nDet S \u22121 Gauss\nd4 q\n1\n\u0002 \u22121 \u0003\nTr\n[S\n(p)\u03a3(q)S\n(p\n+\nq)\u03a3(q)]\n.

In Fig. 4, we show results for\nthe mass spectrum of pions and sigma-mesons as a function of the temperature\nfor vanishing chemical potential \u03bcB = 0 and strong diquark coupling \u03b7D =\n1.0. Since \u2206 = 0, the only threshold for the imaginary parts of meson decays\nis 2m. The \u03c3 mass is always above the threshold and therefore this state is\nunstable in the present model. The pion, however, is a bound state until the\ncritical temperature for the Mott transition TMott = 212.7 MeV is reached. For\nT > TMott the pion becomes unstable for decay into quark-antiquark pairs.\nAs can be seen from the behavior of the spectral function in the lower panel of\nFig. 4, the pion is still a well-identifyable, long-lived resonance in that case. The\ndetailed analytic behavior of the pion at the Mott transition has been discussed\nin the context of the NJL model by H\u00fcfner et al. [21], see also the inset of the\nlower panel of Fig. 4. It shows strong similarities with the behavior of bound\nstates of fermionic atoms in traps when their coupling is tuned by exploiting\nFeshbach resonances in an external magnetic field, see [22]. In the context of\nRHIC experiments, one has discussed such quasi-bound states as an explanation\nfor the perfect liquid behavior of the sQGP [23].\nNext we want to discuss the pionic excitations in the presence of a diquark\ncondensate in the 2SC phase, see Fig. 4. We choose \u03bc = 320 MeV and discuss\nthe effect of melting the 2SC diquark condensate by increasing the temperature\nfrom T = 0 to T > Tc , where Tc = 95 MeV is the critical temperature for\nthe second order transition to the normal quark matter phase. We observe the\nremarkable fact that the 2SC condensate stabilizes the pion at T = 0 as a true\nbound state, although the pion mass exceeds by far the threshold 2m. This effect\nis due to a compensation of gapped and ungapped quark modes and has been\ndiscussed before by Ebert et al. [20] for T = 0 only. Here we extend this study\nto the finite temperature case, where the pion is still a very good resonance, but\nobtains a finite width. At the critical temperature Tc , the normal pion width is\nrestored. But already before T = Tc is reached, the threshold X\u2212 is reached and\nthe corresponding decay process is opened with a considerable width of O(50\nMeV). From the pion spectral function in the lower panel of Fig. 4 we observe\nthe gap in the excitation spectrum due to the presence of the diquark gap. At\nT > Tc , a resonance type spectral function with a threshold at \u03c9 = 2m and a\nresonance peak at \u03c9 \u223c 250 MeV is obtained.\nThe discussion of the mesonic modes in the 2SC phase points to a very rich\nspectrum of excitations which eventually lead to specific new observable signals\n11\n\n\f700\n\n[MeV]\n\n500\n400\n\n\u03b7D = 1.0\n176\n\n200\n\n2m\n\n175\n174\n\n300\n\nm\u03c0\n\n173\n212\n\n213\n\n212,5\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\nm\u03c0\n\n250\n\u03c1\u03c0(\u03c9) [arb. units]\n\n2m\n\nm\u03c0\n\n100\n\n300\n\n\u03bc=0\n\nm\u03c3\n\n600\n\n100\n\n\u0393\u03c0\n200\n\n150\nT [MeV]\n\n\u03bc=0\n\n5\n\n\u03b7D = 1.0\n\n4\n\n300\n\n250\n\nm\u03c0\n\n3\n2\n\n200\n\n1\n0\n\n150\n\n0\n\n200\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nT=0\nT = 200 MeV\nT = 215 MeV\nT = 250 MeV\n\n100\n50\n0\n0\n\n400\n\n200\n\n400\n600\n\u03c9 [MeV]\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nFigure 4: Upper panel: Mass spectrum of mesons (\u03c0, \u03c3) as a function of the\ntemperature for vanishing chemical potential \u03bcB = 0 and strong diquark coupling \u03b7D = 1.0.

The CBM experiment2 planned at FAIR Darmstadt\nand the NICA project3 at JINR Dubna could be capable of creating thermodynamical conditions for the observation of these excitations in the experiment. In\nview of this discovery potential, we want to outline a few points for the further\ndevelopment of the theoretical approach.\n\n3\n\nFurther Developments\n\nIn this contribution we have described the first steps into the interesting and\nvery complex physics of the relativistic BEC-BCS crossover theory. As the next\nsteps following this development, some of the approximations can be removed.\nIn particular, one should next\n\u2022 evaluate the full spectrum of diquark states, including their mixing with\nmesonic channels\n\u2022 study the backreaction of the correlations on the meanfield (selfconsistent\nmeanfield)\n\u2022 include higher orders in the one-fermion-loop approximation (diquarkdiquark and diquark-meson interactions)\n\u2022 study the effect of the color neutrality condition by adjusting color chemical potential(s)\n\u2022 study the effect of charge neutrality (gapless superconductivity)\n\u2022 evaluate the contribution from diquark-antidiquark annihilation to the\nphoton propagator (Maki-Thompson and Aslamasov-Larkin terms).\nIn particular the latter point bears a big potential for applications to the diagnostics of dense qurk matter formed, e.g., in not too high- energy nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions. The onset of color superconductivity not only changes the spectrum\nof diquark states (occurrence of the Goldstone bosons) but due to the nonvanishing diquark gap additional terms for the diquark annihilation process into the\nobservable dilepton channel arise which stem from the nonvanishing anomalous\npropagator contributions. Since the critical temperature for the color superconductivity transition might be as high as 100 MeV there is a fair chance to observe\ntraces of this transition with the future CBM experiment at FAIR Darmstadt.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have derived the gap equations and Bethe-Salpeter equations for the simultaneous treatment of quantized density fluctuations (particle-antiparticle modes\n= mesons) in RPA approximation (one-fermion-loop polarization function) and\nquantized pairing fluctuations (particle-particle modes = diquarks) in ladder approximation (no crossed-ladder or vertex corrections) within the path integral\n2 contribution\n3 contribution\n\nby P. Senger\nby A.S. Sorin et al.\n\n14\n\n\fformalism, i.e. a fully relativistic field theoretical treatment. For the a priori\nunknown interaction, a local current-current coupling (NJL model) has been\nused which in the nonrelativistic limit becomes equivalent to the BCS model\nof superconductivity. After fixing the parameters of the model to the light meson spectrum in the vacuum, the diquark coupling remains as a free parameter\nwhich has been used to extend the model beyond the traditional range of applications into the region of BEC-BCS crossover, where both diquark bound\nstates and scattering states occur simultaneously and determine the physical\nproperties of the system. Recently, the tuning of the coupling in (nonrelativistic) low-temperature systems of fermionic atoms with Feshbach resonances in\nan external magnetic field could be used to investigate the BEC-BCS crossover\nin the laboratory. The nonrelativistic limit of the present approach can be used\nto interprete such results within a local coupling model. The fully relativistic\nform can be applied to model strong coupling QCD and to investigate the effects\nof finite temperature and density on the phase structure. We have presented in\nthis contribution the phase diagram of quark matter at strong and very strong\ncoupling, delineating a possible region of BEC-BCS crossover. The origin of\nthe BEC-BCS crossover in superconducting quark matter is the Mott transition\nfor diquark bound states. We explain the physics of the Mott transition on\nthe example of mesonic correlations. We investigate the spectral function for\npionic correlations (bound and scattering states) outside (T > Tc ) and for the\nfirst time also inside (T < Tc ) the color superconductivity region. We find the\nthresholds for the dissociation of pionic bound states into unbound, but resonant\nscattering states in the quark-antiquark continuum. For the lifetime of pionic\nresonances in the quark matter phase diagram see [24]. Summarizing, we have\nprovided the framework for a study of hot and dense fermion matter beyond the\nmean field within a fully relativistic approach, with yet local interaction and in\nGaussian approximation. The applications to QCD matter within a NJL model\nprovide us with a phase diagram for quark matter which is now augmented with\ninformation about the presence of strong mesonic and diquark correlations with\npossible consequences in the phenomenology of relativistic heavy-ion collisions\nand the interiors of compact stars.\n\nReferences\n[1] Greiner M, Regal C.A. and Jin D.
