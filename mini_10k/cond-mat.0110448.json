The main contribution to the density of states (DOS)\nat the Fermi energy EF comes from Ni 3d states which are hybridized with C 2p states. The\nDOS at EF is varied substantially by the hole or electron doping due to the very high and narrow\nDOS peak located just below EF . We have also explored electronic structures of C-site and Mgsite doped MgCNi3 systems, and described the superconductivity in terms of the conventional\nphonon mechanism.\nKEYWORDS: Antiperovskite, Superconductor, Electronic structure, MgCNi3\n\n\u00a71.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn contrast to the ordinary perovskite structure, antiperovskite structure has metal elements at the corners of the octahedron cage. Ordinarily transition metal\nbased antiperovskites have magnetic ground states. For\nexample, Mn-based antiperovskites have been studied\ndue to their complex magnetic structure1) and large magnetoresistance.2, 3) Recently, superconductivity is observed in antiperovskite MgCNi3 with transition temperature of Tc \u223c 8 K by He et al.4) It is rather suprising\nthat the superconductivity is observed in such materials with much Ni contents. Band calculations show that\nvery narrow and high peak is located just below EF in\ndensity of states (DOS) curve.5, 7, 6, 8, 9) This peak has\nmainly Ni 3d character hybridized with C 2p states.7)\nSuperconductivity of MgCx Ni3 is very sensitive to the\nC contents x. It disappear inbetween x = 0.96 \u223c 0.90.4)\nBy Ni-site doping, superconductivity is also suppressed\neither hole with Co or electron doping with Cu, respectively.5) Especially, Co doping do not induce magnetism,10) and so the magnetism is not the origin of suppression of the superconductivity. Hence the mechanism\nof abrupt quenching of superconductivity is not known\nyet. It is also expected that Mg-site hole doping will\nproduce the magnetic ground state.8, 9)\nIn this work, we have explored C-site and Mg-site doping effects with substituting neighboring atoms in the periodic table. By comparing the DOS, Stoner factor, and\nelectron phonon coupling constant, we have discussed the\neffect of doping on the superconductivity and magnetism.\n\u00a72.\n\nComputational details\n\nWe have used the linearized muffin-tin orbital (LMTO)\nband method in the local density approximation (LDA).\nThe LMTO band calculation include muffin-tin orbitals\nupto d-site for Mg, C, and upto f -site for Ni. We have\nconsidered a cubic structure with lattice constant a =\n\u2217\n\ne-mail: jhshim@postech.ac.kr\n\n3.816 \u00c5, which is for the highly stoichiometric MgCNi3\nwith highest Tc .4) Atomic positions are Mg at (0 0 0),\nC at (1/2 1/2 1/2), and Ni at (1/2 1/2 0), (1/2 0 1/2),\nand (0 1/2 1/2). Atomic sphere radii of Mg, C, and\nNi are employed as 3.20, 1.54 and 2.49 \u00c5, respectively.\nFor the calculation of doped MgCNi3 systems, we have\nconsidered a supercell with the doubled unit cell. One\ntype of Mg or C (111) planes alternate with other type\nplanes along the [111] direction. Without the knowledge\nof real structural information of doped systems, we have\nassumed the same structural parameters.\nTo check the magnetic instability, We calculate the\nStoner exchange enhancement parameter S, defined as\nS \u2261 N (EF )IXC with IXC denoting the intraatomic\nexchange-correlation integral. To investigate the superconducting properties of MgCNi3 based on the rigid-ion\napproximation,11) the electron-phonon coupling constant\n\u03bbph is evaluated by McMillan's formula12)\n\u03bbph =\n\nX N (EF )hI 2 i\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nM\u03b1 h\u03c9\u03b12 i\n\n,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere hI\u03b12 i is the average electron-ion interaction matrix\nelement for the \u03b1-th ion, M\u03b1 is an ionic mass and h\u03c9\u03b12 i\nis the relevant phonon frequency. Since we have no information about phonon frequency, we instead use the\naverage phonon frequency h\u03c9 2 i \u2243 \u03982D /2, where \u0398D is\nthe Debye temperature. \u0398D is adopted for 300 K and\n400 K.\n\u00a73.\n\nElectronic structure of MgCNi3\n\nTotal and partially projected local DOSs of MgCNi3\nare presented in Fig. 1. It is seen that Ni 3d and C 2p\nstates are strongly hybridized. The peak near \u22127 eV\nand 4 eV correspond to \u03c3 bonding and \u03c3 \u2217 antibonding\nstates, respectively. On the other hand, the peak near \u22124\neV and EF correspond to \u03c0 bonding and \u03c0 \u2217 antibonding\nstates, respectively. Because of the \u03c0 \u2217 antibonding states\nnear EF , the DOS is mainly composed by Ni 3d and C 2p\nstates as shown in Table I. Especially, the contribution\nof Ni 3d states to the N(EF ) is as much as 76%. Due to\n\n\f2\n\nJ. H.

The Stoner parameter of\nS = 0.64 shows that this system is not magnetic, but it\nis expected to become magnetic by small hole doping in\nthe rigid band scheme.\nWith the choice of \u0398D = 400 K, one obtains \u03bbph =\n0.77. McMillan's Tc formula with an effective electronelectron interaction parameter \u03bc\u2217 = 0.13 gives rise to Tc\n= 11 K, which are in reasonably agreement with experiment. The superconducting property will be also rapidly\nchanged by hole or electron doping.\n\u00a74.\n\nElectronic structure of C-site and Mg-site\ndoped MgCNi3\n\nTo see the doping effect in a rigid band way, Mg-site or\nC-site doping would be more adequite rather than Ni-site\ndoping. Ni-site doping would perturb electronic structure near EF substantially due to the high contribution\nof doped element. We have examined quite a few doped\nTable I.

As shown in Fig. 2, the effect of doping is\nmainly a variance of Fermi level, even though the shape\nof DOS near EF is perturbed a little bit. Doping with\nB smears the DOS peak near EF , because the upward\nshift of B 2p state induce the strong hybridization with\nNi 3d. Although the Fermi level MgCNi3 is just located\nat DOS peak, The DOS at EF is not so high. By doping\nwith N, the width of the DOS peak between EF and 1.0\neV in MgCNi3 is reduced so that the DOS shape near\nEF is more perturbed. The DOS is not described by a\nsystematic upward shift of the Fermi level.\nTotal DOS at EF , N(EF ), the Stoner parameter S, and\nthe electron-phonon coupling constant \u03bbph are compared\nfor several doped systems in Table II. Contrary to the\nexpectation in the rigid band scheme, N(EF ) is highTable II.

Therefore,\nMg-site hole doping is expected to induce the transition\nfrom superconducting to magnetic instability. On the\nother hand, in the case of electron doping, N(EF ) becomes much smaller than in MgCNi3 , resulting in the\nsuppression of superconductivity.\n\n100\n\n90\nAlCNi 3\n80\n\n\u00a75.\nDENSITY OF STATES (arb. units)\n\n3\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have investigated the electronic structure and superconducting property of MgCNi3 . The \u03c0 \u2217 antibonding state of Ni 3d and C 2p states is located just below\nEF . To explore the doping effect, we have considered\nthe effective hole and electron dopings: at C-site by B\nand N, and at Mg-site by Li and Al. Mg-site doping is\ndescribed better by the rigid band doping effect rather\nthan C-site doping. Mg-site doping with Li is expected\nto show the transition from superconducting to magnetic\nground state.\n\n70\nMg1/2Al 1/2CNi3\n60\n\n50\nMgCNi 3\n40\n\n30\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nLi 1/2Mg 1/2CNi 3\n\nThis work was supported by the KOSEF through the\neSSC at POSTECH and in part by the BK21 Project.\nHelpful discussions with N.

For all cases, the magnetic instability is not shown.\nFrom \u03bbph , it is expected that electron or hole doping\nwould suppress the superconductivity. But, MgNNi3 is\nexpected to have comparable Tc to MgCNi3 , once synthesized successfully in the antiperovskite structure.\nMg-site doping is expected to be better described in\nthe rigid band scheme, because the contribution of Mg to\nN(EF ) is negligible in MgCNi3 . We have performed the\nMg-site doping with Li and Al, which have one less and\none more electron. We have chosen Li as an effective\nhole doping element rather than Na, because the rigid\nband scheme works much better. As shown in Fig. 3,\nthe doping results in only the shift of the Fermi level.\nThe shape of DOS near EF is well maintained.\nTable III shows a systematic behavior of N(EF ) by\ndoping. By hole doping, N(EF ) becomes much larger\nto produce the magnetic instability. Both LiCNi3 and\nTable III.
