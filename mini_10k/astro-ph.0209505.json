However, while\n1\n2\n\nE-mail: loris.colombo@mib.infn.it\nE-mail: silvio.bonometto@mib.infn.it\n\nPreprint submitted to New Astronomy\n\n12 November 2018\n\n\fsignificant anisotropy observations are available (see, e.g., Smoot et al. 1992;\nde Bernardis et al. 2000; Hanany et al. 2000; Halverson et al. 2002; Sievers\net al. 2002; Scott et al. 2002) and further anisotropy data are expected from\nexperiments in progress, detailed data on the weaker polarization signals may\nbecome available only within a few years. In turn, dark energy (DE) parameters or the amplitude of primeval gravitational waves (GW) are just mildly\nconstrained by anisotropy data, while polarization would significantly depend\non them. A peculiar situation then holds for the cosmic optical depth to CMB\nphotons (\u03c4 ), due to reionization. Anisotropy data only mildly constrain it,\nwhile polarization data would provide more stringent constraints; of course,\ngreater \u03c4 values would ease its detection, but, in turn, greater \u03c4 values would\nalso ease the determination of DE and/or GW parameters.\nThis paper tries to investigate which polarization experiment(s) can determine\n\u03c4 . The success of an experiment, however, will also depend on the value of \u03c4\nitself. In particular, we shall consider the SPOrt experiment (Macculi et al.\n2000; Carretti et al. 2000; Peverini et al. 2001), planned to perform a (nearly)\nfull\u2013sky polarization measure aboard of the ISS in 2004, with an angular\nresolution similar to COBE.\nWhen only anisotropy data are considered, there is a degeneracy between\nthe effects of varying \u03c4 or the primeval spectral index ns (Jungman et al.\n1996; Zaldarriaga, Spergel & Seljak 1997; Eisenstein, Hu & Tegmark 1999;\nEfstathiou & Bond 1999). The most stringent limits on \u03c4 , based on anisotropy\ndata, are provided by Stompor et al. (2001), who used the outputs of recent\nballoon experiments to set \u03c4 . 0.4 at the 2\u2013\u03c3 level, once ns is assumed\n\u2264 1.2. (Such limits will be included in a number of figures here below and\ndenominated Stompor limits). Full\u2013sky anisotropy measures from space, like\nMAP 3 or PLANCK 4 , might improve the Stompor limits by a factor \u223c 2. In\nturn, a residual uncertainty (\u223c 0.05) on the value of ns is related to our scarce\nknowledge of \u03c4 . Of course, a more precise determination of ns would really be\nwelcome, first of all to shed new light on the mechanism generating primeval\nfluctuations. Furthermore, within a generic inflationary model, only for ns < 1\nprimeval GW may be expected to exist.\nThe impact that a variation of \u03c4 may have on CMB polarization can be seen\nfrom Fig. 1; here, for a spatially flat cosmological model (density parameters:\n\u03a9m = 0.35, \u03a9b = 0.05; Hubble constant in units of 100 km/s/Mpc: h = 0.65;\nns = 1; dark energy is an ordinary cosmological constant) and for different\nvalues of \u03c4 , we plot the dependence on l of the angular spectra ClA with\nA = T, E, B, X, standing for anisotropy, E\u2013 and B\u2013mode polarization and\nanisotropy\u2013polarization cross correlation respectively; only E\u2013mode polariza3\n4\n\nhttp://map.gsfc.nasa.gov\nhttp://astro.estec.esa.nl/Planck\n\n2\n\n\ftion is considered through this paper. Fig. 1 shows that the main dependence\non \u03c4 actually occurs at low l and for the polarization and cross\u2013correlation\nspectra; comparatively, the \u03c4 dependence of spectra, at l & 30, is milder. This\npoint is important to devise the right polarization experiment, which should\naim to great sensitivity, while, for \u03c4 determination, high resolution data might\nnot bear a direct relevance. Accordingly, the angular resolution of the SPOrt\nexperiment does not prevent it from achieving cosmologically significant results.\nHere, as well as in most recent literature, we assume that the whole cosmic opacity arises from an almost complete ionization of hydrogen, after a\nsuitable redshift. More complex reionization histories may have to be taken\ninto account to discuss future data (Bruscoli, Ferrara & Scannapieco 2002;\nVenkatesan 2002), but would not modify general conclusions.\nFor low\u2013l spectral components, varying ns has a milder effect than varying\n\u03c4 . If the whole angular spectrum is considered, other parameters, like \u03a9tot ,\n\u03a9m , \u03a9b (total, matter and baryon density parameters), may be determined\nindependently from low\u2013l features. Here we shall assume that they are already\nknown from such high\u2013l anisotropy measures.\nDealing with low l's, a significant part of our analysis will be devoted to inspect\ncosmic variance. Its impact on Cl determination is known. Here, however, we\nare interested in measuring different quantities and a knowledge of Cl 's is\nnot even required. We shall explore this point by simulating and analyzing a\nlarge number of artificial data sets. Among other things, we shall see that the\nSPOrt experiment, although far from granting a stringent \u03c4 determination,\nmay improve the Stompor limit in a significant number of cases.\nIn the next section we shall first debate which range of values can be expected\nfor \u03c4 . We shall then describe how artificial data sets are produced. In section 4\nwe shall show the results of their analysis, in a number of different experimental\nconditions and considering different \u03c4 values. In section 5, conclusions will be\ndrawn.\n\n2\n\nThe cosmic opacity to CMB photons\n\nIn the present cosmic epoch, although diffuse baryonic materials are almost\n\u22122\ncompletely ionized, the scattering time for CMB photons ts \u2243 4.45*1018 \u03a9\u22121\nb h s\n(h: Hubble parameter in units of 100 km/s/Mpc) exceeds the Hubble time\ntH = 3.09 * 1017 h\u22121 s and the Universe is transparent to CMB photons. These\nfigures can be extrapolated to the past, but, while ts \u221d a3 (a: the scale factor),\nthe dependence of tH on a depends on the cosmological model. In an expan3\n\n\fsion regime dominated by non\u2013relativistic matter, a fully ionized Universe is\nopaque to CMB at z > zop \u2243 5 (\u03a9b h)\u22122/3 . Therefore, assuming \u03a9b h2 \u2264 0.022\n(standard BBNS limits; see, e.g., Dolgov 2002 for a recent review) and h \u2243 0.5,\nwe have zop > 64, safely above the expected reionization redshift zri . No reasonable cosmological model allows a substantial reduction of such zop .\nOn the contrary, the precise value of \u03c4 (\u226a 1), does depend on the model and,\nin particular, on zri . Recent data on high\u2013z QSO's (Djorgovski et al. 2001;\nBecker et al. 2001) indicate that at least a fraction of neutral hydrogen is\npresent, in the intergalactic medium, at z & 6. These very authors, however,\nwarn us against an immediate conclusion that zri \u2243 6. Reionization can be\na slow and/or patchy process and our present knowledge of primeval object\nformation can be consistent with an effective zri \u2243 6 or a significantly greater\nvalue. In Fig. 2 we show how \u03c4 is related to zri and model features, considering\na wide set of cosmological models. For zri . 15, values of \u03c4 up to \u223c 0.15\u20130.20\nare licit.\n\n3\n\nThe artificial data sets\n\nArtificial data sets will be built with reference to the features of the Sky Polarization Observatory (SPOrt) experiment, selected by the European Space\nAgency (ESA) to fly on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2004, aiming\nto measure the linear polarization of the diffuse sky radiation at 22, 32 and\n90 GHz, using a set of polarimeters fed by corrugated horns with an angular\nresolution (FWHM) of 7o . At variance from other space experiments (MAP\nand PLANCK), SPOrt has been explicitly designed to measure the Stokes\nparameters Q and U and to minimize systematics and instrumental polarization. SPOrt will observe a sky area with declination |\u03b4| \u2264 51.6o (\u223c 80% of\nthe whole sky). The lifetime of the experiment is at least 1.5 years, but an\nextension is not unlikely; data will be binned in a number of pixels ranging\nfrom 662 to several thousands, depending on the effective duration of the flight\nand efficiency.\nIn this analysis we shall assume that pixels are distributed according to the\nHEALPix 5 package, with N side = 8 or 16, and smoothed with a Gaussian\nbeam of FWHM of 7o . The two choices of N side allow to confirm that the\nbest exploitation of the observational output is achieved when the average\nangular distance between pixel centers is \u223c half FWHM. For the low (high)\nresolution cases we shall therefore have, on the whole sky, 768 (3072) pixels,\nwhose centers lie at an average angular distance of \u223c 7.3o (3.7o ). Once polar\ncaps are excluded, there remain 600 (2448) pixels, providing measures of the\n5\n\nhttp://www.eso.org/science/healpix/\n\n4\n\n\fStokes parameters Q and U.\nSPOrt polarimeters will provide no anisotropy data. Such information will be\nhowever available through other experiments (COBE, MAP) and we shall assume here that no peculiar problem arises in correlating SPOrt and anisotropy\ndata. Of course, anisotropy data probe a different sky area, i.e. the whole sky,\nexcluding the area with declination |\u03b4| < 20o , where galactic contamination\nis severe. (On the contrary, such contamination can be assumed to be under\ncontrol, for polarization data; see, e.g., Bruscoli et al. 2002; Tucci et al. 2002.)\nFor the coarse (fine) pixelization cases, as above, in this sky area there are 480\n(1984) pixels. For 376 (1360) of them, both anisotropy and polarization data\nare supposed to be available.\nP\nRandom noise (\u03c3pix\n) will be included in artificial data, assuming it to be\nuncorrelated, both among pixels and between Q and U, in the case of polarT\nization measures. We shall assume \u03c3pix\n= 1 \u03bcK (2\u03bcK) for temperature data (as\nexpected for MAP measurements scaled to the SPOrt resolution). On the contrary, one of the main variables we consider is the noise level for polarization\ndata.\nside\n\nq\n\n1.5 0.5\nP\nSPOrt data will be characterized by \u03c3pix\n\u2243 5.3 N 8\n\u03bcK per pixel,\n\u03bb \u01eb\nwhere \u03bb is the experiment's lifetime in years while \u01eb indicates the detection\nP\nefficiency. Our analysis will consider \u03c3pix\n's in the interval comprised from 0.5\nto 5 \u03bcK per pixel, with coarse pixelization, corresponding to 1 to 10 \u03bcK per\npixel, with fine pixelization.\n\nThe expected angular spectra ClT,E,B,X , were produced with the program\nCMBFAST 6 , starting from a spatially flat cosmological model with \u03a9m =\n0.35, \u03a9b = 0.05, h = 0.65. Dark energy is an ordinary cosmological constant.\nSeveral values of ns were considered, but we shall report results only for ns = 1.\nOther close ns values yield quantitatively similar results and the potentiality\nof the experiment does not depend on ns , in any appreciable way. On the\ncontrary, our analysis aimed to exploring \u03c4 values ranging from 0.035 to 0.25.\nCosmic variance was taken into account by considering 1000 independent reP\nalizations for each \u03c4 and \u03c3pix\npair.\n\n4\n\nData analysis\n\nThe first aim of our analysis amounts to finding the likelihood distribution on\nthe plane \u03c4 \u2013ns . The number of pixels for anisotropy and polarization (NT and\nNP ) in our (artificial) data are different. Let then Tj be the anisotropy mea6\n\nhttp://physics.nyu.edu/matiasz/CMBFAST/cmbfast.html\n\n5\n\n\fsured in NT pixels and Qj and Uj the Stokes parameters measured in NP pixels.\nIn general, let us define vectors x \u2261 (T1 , ....., TNT , Q1 , ....., QNP , U1 , ....., UNP ),\nof Ns = NT + 2NP components, defining an observed state of anisotropy\nand polarization. Once a pair of values \u03c4 \u2013ns is assigned, the angular spectra\nClA = (ClT , ClE , ClX ) are univocally determined. On the contrary, a data vector d, of Ns components, built from them, is just a realization of such model:\nonce the Ns component vector d is assigned, the pair of values \u03c4 \u2013ns is not\nunivocally fixed.\nA function\n1\n1\nL(d|ClA ) \u221d [ det M ]\u2212 2 exp [ \u2212 dT M\u22121 d]\n2\n\n(1)\n\nshall then be built, to yield the likelihood of a given set of ClA (i.e., of a pair\nof \u03c4 \u2013ns values), if d is observed. The main ingredient of L is the correlation\nmatrix Mij = hxTi xj i = Sij + Nij ; here Sij is the signal term and Nij is\ndue to the noise. The components Mij yield the correlation between the ith\nand jth elements of data vectors x corresponding to particular choices of ClA ,\ni.e. of \u03c4 \u2013ns values. The construction of the (model dependent) signal term,\nhowever, does not require to build explicitly the vectors x. The procedure\nto be followed, in the case when both anisotropy and polarization data are\navailable, is explicitly reported by Zaldarriaga (1998). The construction of\nthe noise term is simpler, as we expect no noise correlation, and the matrix\nNij = \u03b4ij \u03c3T,pix 2 (for i = 1, ..., NT ) and Nij = \u03b4ij \u03c3P,pix 2 (for i = NT + 1, ..., Ns )\nis diagonal.\nIn what follows, the technical role of the ClA spectra will not need to be\nfurther outlined and the likelihood function will be explicitly considered to\ndepend on \u03c4 and ns . In particular, we assume that the most probable \u03c4 \u2013ns\npair, for a given anisotropy\u2013polarization state d, is the one which maximizes\nthe likelihood. On the \u03c4 \u2013ns plane, we can then define curves connecting points\nwhere L corresponds to a given fraction of its top value. The area enclosed\nby each such curve corresponds to a given confidence level. In the figures\nbelow, such fractions were selected in order that the areas enclosed by the\ncurves correspond to 68 %, 90 % and 99 % confidence levels. For the sake of\nsimplicity, we shall refer to them as 1\u20132\u20133 \u03c3 levels.\nBecause of the role played by low\u2013l harmonics in our analysis, as above outlined, cosmic variance may be quite significant. Henceforth, 1000 realizations\nof each model will be considered; 1\u20132\u20133 \u03c3 curves will be obtained by averaging among the results of such realizations, so obtaining an average likelihood\ndistribution. Of course, this is not sufficient to evaluate the expected result\nof a given experiment. We shall therefore implement average results with histograms, describing the distribution of results in various realizations, suitably\ndefined for the various cases.\n6\n\n\f5\n\nResults\n\nBecause of the large number of realizations required, we considered likelihood\ndistributions both for coarse and fine pixelization, corresponding to distances\nbetween pixel centers of \u223c 7.3o or 3.7o (see section 3). A comparison of such\ndistributions, for the cases we treated in both ways, confirms that, in general,\na finer pixelization allows a better exploitation of data. Finding some general\ntrends, however, does not require fine pixelization analysis.\nIn Fig. 3, we report the likelihood distributions for \u03c4 = 0.05 and 4 levels of\nP\n\u03c3pix\n(for coarse pixelization). In Fig. 4, we report the likelihood distribution for\nP\nthe same \u03c4 value and \u03c3pix\n= 2 \u03bcK (for fine pixelization, corresponding to 1 \u03bcK\nwith coarse pixelization). Besides of the solid curves obtained by considering\nboth anisotropy and polarization, dashed curves are shown, obtained from\npolarization data only. Stompor limits are explicitly shown in Fig. 4, while\nin Fig. 3 we report Stompor's 95 % confidence limit only. See the caption of\nFig. 4 for further details on Stompor limits.\nFrom these figures it is clearly visible that upper limits on \u03c4 can be significantly\nP\nimproved, in respect to previous analyses, for \u03c3pix\n. 2\u20133 \u03bcK. This is true even\nif only polarization data are used. The main improvement obtained, when\nusing anisotropy data as well, concerns ns , for which both lower and upper\nlimits are obtained. When passing from coarse to fine pixelization, ns is even\nP\nbetter constrained. If \u03c3pix\nis at the lowest levels considered, ns determination\nis better than in Stompor's case.\nFor what concerns lower limits on \u03c4 , the situation is more critical. Detecting\na lower limit, however, should be the main aim of such kind of experiments.\nFig. 4 shows that a lower limit, in average, can be detected at the 1\u2013\u03c3 confidence level at most. This is a case, however, when average estimates themselves are insufficient. In Fig. 5, therefore, we show the distribution of 1\u2013\u03c3\nlower limits found, with or without taking into account anisotropy, with fine\npixelization. In the former case, we see that, in \u223c 78 % of cases a lower limit\nis found. Such percentage decreases to \u223c 70 %, if no anisotropy data could be\nconsidered. For the sake of comparison, let us report that the above figures\ndecrease to \u223c 76 % and \u223c 64 %, with coarse pixelization.\nGoing below a noise level of 2 \u03bcK per pixel (with fine pixelization), although\nhighly problematic from an experimental point of view, would be however\nP\ndecisive. This is shown by Fig. 6, where we see that, for \u03c3pix\n= 1 \u03bcK, even\nthe average 3\u2013\u03c3 curve indicates a detection of \u03c4 > 0. If the distribution of\nlower limits in various realizations is considered, we find that, only in \u223c 2 %\nof cases, no 3\u2013\u03c3 lower limits would be detectable.\nLet us now consider the cases with greater \u03c4 values. They are reported in\n7\n\n\fFig. 7 and 8, for \u03c4 = 0.10 and 0.15. These figures are all obtained with coarse\npixelization. They confirm that significant improvements of Stompor upper\nP\nlimits on \u03c4 are obtainable for \u03c3pix\n. 2\u20133 \u03bcK. Moreover, lower limits become\nP\nsafer than in the \u03c4 = 0.05 case. Even with \u03c3pix\n= 2 \u03bcK, if \u03c4 \u223c 0.15, a 1\u2013\u03c3\nlower limit is likely to be obtained and a 2\u2013\u03c3 lower limit might be obtained\nas well. This is an important point, as such noise levels are not far from those\nobtainable, in the best possible conditions, by the SPOrt experiment.\nIt is also significant to go above average values, for lower limits, in all previous\ncases. In Fig. 9 to 11, we report the fractions of realizations, for which lower\nlimits were detected, both using anisotropy\u2013polarization data and polarization\nonly. Among various possible comments, these plots confirm that, in order to\ndetect \u03c4 (unless & 0.15), the noise level of the SPOrt experiment is too high.\nIt may also be significant to compare these figures with the expected noise\nlevel in the PLANCK measurements of polarization. Weighting the various\nP\nchannels in order to minimize variance, it is expected that \u03c3pix\n\u223c 9 \u03bcK, for a\n\u2032\nP\nFWHM of 7 (see, e.g., Hu & Okamoto 2002). If a scaling \u03c3pix \u221d angle\u22121 is\nP\nassumed, this yields \u03c3pix\n\u223c 0.4 \u03bcK, if reported to our fine pixelization. At such\nnoise level, no magnification of the intrinsic cosmic variance seems to occur.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we performed a likelihood analysis, to determine how a polarization experiment could break the degeneracy between ns and \u03c4 determinations,\nfound in pure anisotropy analyses. To this aim we built artificial data, consistent with an experiment in progress to detect polarization, but pushing noise\neven well below the expected experimental level. The experiment considered\nwill cover 80 % of the whole sky and artificial data were built assuming such\nsky coverage. If data were available for the full sky, a slight improvement of\nthe signal can be expected. Artificial data were then analyzed. In respect to\nfuture observers, we have however the critical advantage to be able to analyze\nas many skies (realizations) we need. This is significant, in our case, as the\nns \u2013\u03c4 degeneracy, in principle, is readily overcome from low\u2013l spectral components, where, however, cosmic variance can be critical. Our results, however,\nindicate that cosmic variance is not such a severe limitation, if a sufficiently\nlow noise level is attained. This is one of the most important conclusions of\nour analysis, as it confirms that, to detect \u03c4 , polarization experiments should\naim to high sensitivity, while high resolution does not bear a direct relevance.\nThe critical issue, in this respect, is whether and when firm lower limits on\n\u03c4 are obtainable. The noise level to be attained, to implement such aim, obviously depends on the physical value of \u03c4 itself. Available constraints on \u03c4 ,\nbesides that from CMB anisotropy data, can be also related to the detection of\n8\n\n\fhydrogen lines in high\u2013z QSO spectra. This however leaves us a still significant\nrange of possible cosmic opacities to CMB photons.\nIf \u03c4 is not negligibly low, the noise level below which we expect that lower limP\nits on \u03c4 can be obtained is \u03c3pix\n\u2243 1\u20132 \u03bcK, for an instrument with an angular\nP\nresolution similar to COBE. A detection, at higher \u03c3pix\n, cannot be however\nexcluded. We compared such general conclusion with the actual expected features of the SPOrt experiment and found that, for some of the greatest values\nfor \u03c4 allowed by the cosmic reionization physics, and assuming the best possible performance of the experiment, a detection of \u03c4 , at the 2\u2013\u03c3 level, is\npossible.\nAcknowledgements \u2013 The public programs CMBFAST, by U.
