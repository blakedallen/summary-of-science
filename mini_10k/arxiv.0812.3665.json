We use grid diagrams to present a unified picture of braids, Legendrian knots,\nand transverse knots.\n\n1. Introduction\nGrid diagrams, also known in the literature as arc presentations, are a convenient combinatorial tool for studying knots and links in R3 . Although grid diagrams (or equivalent\nstructures) have been studied for over a century ([Bru, Cro, Dyn]), they have recently regained prominence due to their role in the combinatorial formulation of knot Floer homology\n([MOS, MOST]).\nIt has been known for some time that grid diagrams are closely related to contact geometry as well as to braid theory. Our purpose here is to indicate the extent to which the\nrelationships are similar. Indeed, braids, like the Legendrian and transverse knots in contact\ngeometry, can be viewed as certain equivalence classes of grid diagrams, and we will see that\nthe various equivalences fit into one single description. Furthermore, this description is compatible with the various maps between these objects, like the transverse knot constructed\nfrom a braid. Much of the picture we will present has previously appeared, but we believe\nthat the full picture (especially the part concerning braids) is new.\nDefinition 1. A grid diagram with grid number n is an n \u00d7 n square grid with n X's and\nn O's placed in distinct squares, such that each row and each column contains exactly one\nX and one O.\nWe will employ the word \"knot\" throughout as shorthand for \"oriented knot or oriented\nlink\". Then any grid diagram yields a diagram of a knot in a standard way: connect O to X\nin each row, connect X to O in each column, and have the vertical line segments pass over\nthe horizontal ones (Figure 1). In addition, one can associate to any grid diagram not only\na topological knot but also a braid, a Legendrian knot, and a transverse knot. We will use\nthe following notation:\nG = {grid diagrams}\nK = {isotopy classes of topological knots}\nB = {isotopy classes of braids modulo conjugation and exchange}\nL = {Legendrian isotopy classes of Legendrian knots}\nT = {transverse isotopy classes of transverse knots}.\n(For definitions, see Section 2.)\n1\n\n\f2\n\nNG, THURSTON\n\nFigure 1. A grid diagram and corresponding knot diagram and Legendrian front.\nIn Section 2, we will review maps between these various sets that fit together into the\nfollowing commutative diagram:\nG?\n?\n\n(1)\n\n/\n\nL0\n00\n??\n??\n00\n??\n00\n\u000f\n\u001f \u000f\n0\nB PPPP / T A 00\nPPP AAA 00\nPPP AA 00\nPPP AA 0\nPP' \u0018\n\nK.\n\nHere the map from G to K is as described above. For the other maps, see also [Ben, Cro,\nDyn, KN, MM, OST].\nIn [Cro] (see also [Dyn]), Cromwell provides a list of alterations of grid diagrams that\ndo not change topological knot type, the grid-diagram equivalent of Reidemeister moves for\nknot diagrams. These are collectively known as Cromwell moves and consist of translations,\ncommutations, and stabilizations/destabilizations. The last we distinguish into four types,\nX:NW, X:NE, X:SW, and X:SE, following [OST].\nProposition 1 (Cromwell [Cro]). The map G \u2192 K sending grid diagrams to topological\nknots induces a bijection\nK \u2190\u2192 G/(translation, commutation, (de)stabilization).\nWe will see that the maps from G to B, L, and T can be similarly understood. More\nprecisely, we have the following result.\nProposition 2. Let G\u0303 denote the quotient set G/(translation, commutation). The maps\nG \u2192 B, G \u2192 L, and G \u2192 T induce bijections\nB \u2190\u2192 G\u0303/(X:NE,X:SE (de)stabilization)\nL \u2190\u2192 G\u0303/(X:NE,X:SW (de)stabilization)\nT \u2190\u2192 G\u0303/(X:NE,X:SW,X:SE (de)stabilization).\nIt follows from this result that the maps between B, L, T , K can also be interpreted in\nterms of grid diagrams. For instance, the map B \u2192 T is the quotient\nG\u0303/(X:NE,X:SE (de)stabilization) \u2212\u2192 G\u0303/(X:NE,X:SW,X:SE (de)stabilization).\nSimilarly, the maps B \u2192 K, L \u2192 T , L \u2192 K, T \u2192 K, in terms of grid diagrams, are\nquotients by various (de)stabilizations.\n\n\fGRID DIAGRAMS, BRAIDS, AND CONTACT GEOMETRY\n\nNW\n\nLegendrian knots\n\n3\n\nNE\ntopological knots\n\nSW\n\nSE\n\nbraids mod\nconjugacy + exchange\n\ntransverse knots\n\nFigure 2. Quotienting G\u0303, the set of grid-diagram orbits under translation and commutation, by various combinations of X (de)stabilizations yields\nequivalence classes of braids and various types of knots.\nProposition 2 is summarized diagrammatically in Figure 2. The bijections in Proposition 2\ninvolving L and T have already been established in [OST]; the new content in this note is\nthe bijection involving B.\nWe note that stabilization operations on braids and Legendrian and transverse knots can\nbe expressed in terms of Cromwell moves. More precisely, we have the following.\nProposition 3. Under the identifications of Proposition 2, we have\npositive braid\nnegative braid\npositive Legendrian\nnegative Legendrian\ntransverse\n\nstabilization \u2190\u2192 X:SW stabilization\nstabilization \u2190\u2192 X:NW stabilization\nstabilization \u2190\u2192 X:NW stabilization\nstabilization \u2190\u2192 X:SE stabilization\nstabilization \u2190\u2192 X:NW stabilization.\n\nProposition 3 follows from an inspection of the effect of the various X stabilizations on\nthe corresponding braid or Legendrian or transverse knot. See also the table at the end of\nSection 2.4.\nPropositions 2 and 3 give an alternate proof via grid diagrams of the following result.\nProposition 4 (Transverse Markov Theorem [OSh, Wr]). Two braids represent isotopic\ntransverse knots if and only if they are related by a sequence of conjugations and positive\nbraid stabilizations and destabilizations.\nIn the usual formulation of Proposition 4, the map from braids to transverse knots uses a\ncontact-geometric construction of Bennequin [Ben] (cf. Section 2.4), rather than the map we\nuse here; see [KN] for a proof that the two maps coincide.\nIn Section 2, we recall the various relevant constructions and discuss the effects of griddiagram symmetries on the maps in Formula (1). We prove our main result, Proposition 2,\nin Section 3.\n2. Definitions and Maps\n2.1. Grid diagrams. The Cromwell moves on grid diagrams, translation, commutation,\nand stabilization/destabilization, are illustrated in Figure 3 and defined below. From that\n\n\f4\n\nNG, THURSTON\n\nFigure 3. Illustration of a sequence of Cromwell moves. In succession: X:SE\ndestabilization; horizontal commutation; vertical torus translation; vertical\ncommutation; horizontal torus translation; O:SW stabilization. The highlighted sections of each diagram indicate the portion that changes under the\nfollowing move.\n\nfigure it is clear that each Cromwell move preserves the topological type of the corresponding\nknot.\nTranslation views a grid diagram as lying on a torus by identifying opposite ends of the\ngrid, and changes the diagram by translation in the torus. Any translation is a composition\nof some number of vertical translations, which move the top row of the diagram to the bottom\nor vice versa, and horizontal translations, which move the leftmost column of the diagram\nto the rightmost or vice versa.\nCommutation interchanges two adjacent rows (vertical commutation) or two adjacent\ncolumns (horizontal commutation). These adjacent rows or columns are required to be\ndisjoint or nested in the following sense. For rows, the four X's and O's in the adjacent rows\nmust lie in distinct columns, and the horizontal line segments connecting O and X in each\n\n\fGRID DIAGRAMS, BRAIDS, AND CONTACT GEOMETRY\n\n5\n\nrow must be either disjoint or nested (one contained in the other) when projected to a single\nhorizontal line; there is an obvious analogous condition for columns.\nAn X (resp. O) destabilization replaces a 2 \u00d7 2 subgrid containing two X's and one O\n(resp. two O's and one X) with a single square containing an X (resp. O), eliminating one\nrow and one column in the process. Stabilization is the inverse of destabilization. Each\n(de)stabilization is identified by its type, X or O, along with the corner in the 2 \u00d7 2 subgrid\nnot occupied by a symbol. This yields eight possibilities: X:NW, X:NE, X:SW, X:SE,\nO:NW, O:NE, O:SW, O:SE. It is easy to check that any O:NW (resp. O:NE, O:SW, O:SE)\n(de)stabilization can be expressed as a composition of translations, commutations, and one\nX:SE (resp. XSW, X:NE, X:NW) (de)stabilization. Thus we restrict our set of Cromwell\nmoves to include only X (de)stabilizations.\nRemark 5. By the argument of [OST, Lemma 4.3], we can instead drop torus translations and\nkeep matching O (de)stabilizations to yield alternate definitions for topological, Legendrian,\nand transverse knots in terms of grid diagrams. In particular, X:NE, X:SW, O:SW, and\nO:NE (de)stabilizations, combined with commutations, generate all torus translations. The\nsame argument can also be adapted for braids: that is, B is also G modulo commutation and\nX:NE, X:SE, O:NW, and O:SW (de)stabilization, as follows. Sequences of moves similar to\nthose from [OST, Lemma 4.3] show that any horizontal torus translation can be achieved by\nthese moves, as can any vertical torus translation where the O appears to the left of the X.\nBut any vertical torus translation can be put into the correct position by horizontal torus\ntranslations.\n2.2. Braids. As usual, a braid of braid index n is an element of the group Bn generated\nby \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n\u22121 with relations \u03c3i \u03c3i+1 \u03c3i = \u03c3i+1 \u03c3i \u03c3i+1 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 2 and \u03c3i \u03c3j = \u03c3j \u03c3i for\n|i \u2212 j| \u2265 2. Note the natural inclusion Bn \u2282 Bn+1 sending \u03c3i to itself for i \u2264 n \u2212 1. The\nrelevant moves to consider on braids are:\n\u2022 braid conjugation: B 7\u2192 B 0 B(B 0 )\u22121 for B, B 0 \u2208 Bn ;\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u2022 exchange move [BM]: B1 \u03c3n\u22121 B2 \u03c3n\u22121\n7\u2192 B1 \u03c3n\u22121\nB2 \u03c3n\u22121 on Bn , where B1 , B2 \u2208\nBn\u22121 \u2282 Bn ;\n\u2022 braid stabilization: either positive braid stabilization (B \u2208 Bn ) 7\u2192 (B\u03c3n \u2208 Bn+1 ) or\nnegative braid stabilization (B \u2208 Bn ) 7\u2192 (B\u03c3n\u22121 \u2208 Bn+1 ); and\n\u2022 braid destabilization: the inverse of braid stabilization.\nIn fact, by an observation of Birman and Wrinkle [BW], an exchange move can be expressed\nas a combination of one positive stabilization, one positive destabilization, and a number of\nconjugations. (Here the positive stabilization and positive destabilization can equally well be\nreplaced by a negative stabilization and negative destabilization.)

Positive and negative Legendrian stabilizations of the front projection of a Legendrian knot.\nWe will depict braids horizontally from left to right, with strands numbered from top to\nbottom; for instance, \u03c31 interchanges the top two strands, with the top strand passing over\nthe other as we move from left to right.\n2.3. Legendrian and transverse knots. We give a quick description of Legendrian and\ntransverse knots, which occur naturally in contact geometry; see, e.g., [Et] for more details.\nA Legendrian knot is a knot in R3 along which the standard contact form dz \u2212 y dx vanishes\neverywhere; a transverse knot is a knot in R3 along which dz \u2212 y dx > 0 everywhere. (Note\nfor the condition dz \u2212 y dx > 0 that the knot is oriented.) We consider Legendrian (resp.\ntransverse) knots up to Legendrian isotopy (resp. transverse isotopy), which is simply isotopy\nthrough Legendrian (resp. transverse) knots.\nOne convenient way to depict a Legendrian knot is through its front projection, or projection in the xz plane. A generic front projection has three features: it has no vertical\ntangencies; it is immersed except at cusp singularities; and at all crossings, the strand of\nlarger slope passes underneath the strand of smaller slope. Any front with these features\ncorresponds to a Legendrian knot, with the y coordinate given by y = dz/dx.\nThe knot diagram corresponding to any grid diagram can be viewed as the front projection\nof a Legendrian knot by rotating it 45\u25e6 counterclockwise and smoothing out the corners,\ncreating cusps where necessary; see Figure 1 for an example. This yields a map G \u2192 L from\ngrid diagrams to isotopy classes of Legendrian knots. Note that our convention differs from\nthe convention of [OST]: the convention there is to reverse all crossings in the grid diagram\nand then rotate 45\u25e6 clockwise. See also Section 2.5.\nIn [OST], it is verified that changing a grid diagram by translation, commutation, or\n(in our convention) X:SW, X:NE (de)stabilization does not change the isotopy class of the\ncorresponding Legendrian knot. Changing by X:NW (resp. X:SE) stabilization does change\nthe Legendrian knot type, by positive Legendrian stabilization (resp. negative Legendrian\nstabilization). Legendrian stabilizations can be described in the front projection as adding\na zigzag, as shown in Figure 4.\nAny Legendrian knot is isotopic to one obtained from some grid diagram. It is shown\nin [OST] that the set of equivalence classes of Legendrian knots under Legendrian isotopy\ncorresponds precisely to grid diagrams modulo translation, commutation, and X:NE, X:SW\n(de)stabilization, as presented in Proposition 2.\nA Legendrian knot can be C 0 perturbed to a transverse knot, its positive transverse\npushoff. The resulting map L \u2192 T is not injective; negative Legendrian stabilization does\nnot change the transverse isotopy type of the positive transverse pushoff. It is a standard\nfact in contact geometry [EFM] that this gives a bijection\nT \u2190\u2192 L/(negative Legendrian stabilization).\nSince negative Legendrian stabilization corresponds to an X:SE Cromwell move, the characterization in Proposition 2 of T as a quotient of G holds. Note that positive Legendrian\nstabilization becomes the \"transverse stabilization\" operation on transverse knots.\n\n\fGRID DIAGRAMS, BRAIDS, AND CONTACT GEOMETRY\n\n7\n\nFigure 5. Braid version (left) of the grid diagram in Figure 1. Omitting the\nX's and O's produces a rectilinear braid diagram, which can be perturbed to\nbecome a braid, in this case \u03c32\u22121 \u03c31 \u03c322 \u03c312 \u2208 B3 .\n2.4. Maps between G, B, L, T , K. Here we collect the constructions of the maps in Formula (1). It suffices to define G \u2192 L, G \u2192 B, L \u2192 T , B \u2192 T , and T \u2192 K, since the other\nmaps follow by composition. We note that the commutativity of the square\n/\n\nG\n\u000f\n\nB\n\n/\n\nL\n\u000f\n\nT\n\nwas established in [KN], and in fact our description of the maps is essentially identical to\nthe one given there. The maps G \u2192 L and L \u2192 T have already been discussed; since the\nmap T \u2192 K is obvious, we are left with G \u2192 B and B \u2192 T .\nWe begin with the map G \u2192 B, as described in [Cro, Dyn]; this is also called a \"flip\" in\n[MM]. Any braid in Bn can be viewed as a braid diagram: a tangle diagram of n strands\nin the strip [0, 1] \u00d7 R, oriented so that the orientation points rightward at all points, with\nsome collection of n distinct points x1 , . . . , xn \u2208 R for which the braid intersects {0} \u00d7 R and\n{1} \u00d7 R in {(0, x1 ), . . . , (0, xn )} and {(1, x1 ), . . . , (1, xn )} respectively. Define a rectilinear\nbraid diagram (cf. \"braided rectangular diagram\" [MM]) to be a tangle diagram in [0, 1] \u00d7\nR with the same boundary conditions as a braid diagram, but consisting exclusively of\nhorizontal and vertical line segments, satisfying the following properties:\n\u2022 vertical segments always pass over horizontal segments;\n\u2022 each strand can be oriented so that every horizontal segment is oriented rightwards.\nAny rectilinear braid diagram can be perturbed into a standard braid diagram by perturbing\nvertical segments slightly to point rightwards, as in Figure 5.\nNow given a grid diagram, one obtains a knot diagram as usual by drawing horizontal\nand vertical lines. Turn this into a rectilinear braid diagram by replacing any horizontal line\noriented leftwards from O to X by two horizontal lines, one pointing rightwards from the O,\none pointing rightwards to the X, and have these new horizontal lines pass under all vertical\nline segments as usual. The rectilinear braid diagram corresponds to a braid as described\nabove. This produces the desired map G \u2192 B.\nIt remains to define the map B \u2192 T . The original contact-geometric definition from [Ben]\nis as follows. Identify ends of B to obtain a knot or link in the solid torus S 1 \u00d7 D2 . View\nthe solid torus as a small (framed) tubular neighborhood of the standard transverse unknot\nin R3 with self-linking number \u22121. Then B becomes a transverse knot in a neighborhood of\nthe transverse unknot.\n\n\f8\n\nNG, THURSTON\n\nB\n\nFigure 6.

A braid exchange move produces a Legendrian-isotopic front.\nEquality denotes Legendrian isotopy.\nThere is also a combinatorial description for the map B \u2192 T , which we now describe.\n(This description is proven to coincide with the contact-geometric description in [KN]; see\nalso [MM, OSh]). Create a front by replacing each braid crossing as shown in Figure 6\nand joining corresponding braid ends. (Joining ends introduces 2n cusps for a braid with n\nstrands; see Figure 6.) This construction produces a Legendrian knot from any braid.\nIt is an easy exercise in Legendrian Reidemeister moves to show that changing the braid by\nisotopy changes the Legendrian knot by isotopy and negative Legendrian (de)stabilization;\nthe stabilization is needed when one introduces cancelling terms \u03c3i \u03c3i\u22121 or \u03c3i\u22121 \u03c3i in the braid.\nSimilarly, a conjugation or exchange move on a braid produces a Legendrian isotopy of the\nLegendrian knot. See Figure 7 for the exchange move.\nThe map B \u2192 T is now given as follows: given a braid, the corresponding Legendrian front\nis well-defined up to isotopy and negative Legendrian stabilization, and hence its positive\ntransverse pushoff is well-defined. This transverse knot (equivalently, the class of the Legendrian knot modulo negative Legendrian (de)stabilization) is unchanged by braid conjugation\nand exchange.\nTable 1 has a summary of the effect of the Cromwell moves on grid diagrams correspond\nto changes in the associated braid, Legendrian knot, and transverse knot. The braid column\nis verified in Section 3, while the Legendrian and transverse columns were established in\n[OST]. For completeness, the table includes O as well as X stabilizations.\n2.5. Symmetries and conventions. Here we discuss various symmetries of grid diagrams\nand how they relate the conventions for the maps in Formula (1) to other, sometimes conflicting, conventions in the literature. In this section, we will denote the maps G \u2192 L, G \u2192 T ,\nG \u2192 B described in Section 2.4 by G 7\u2192 L(G), G 7\u2192 T (G), G 7\u2192 B\u0001 (G), respectively.\n\n\fGRID DIAGRAMS, BRAIDS, AND CONTACT GEOMETRY\n\n9\n\nGrid diagram\n\nBraid\n\nLegendrian knot\n\nTransverse knot\n\ntorus translation\nvertical commutation\nhorizontal commutation\nX:NE, O:SW stab\nX:SW, O:NE stab\nX:SE, O:NW stab\nX:NW, O:SE stab\n\nconjugation\nunchanged\nconj, exchange\nunchanged\nconj, + braid stab\nunchanged\nconj, \u2212 braid stab\n\nLegendrian isotopy\nLegendrian isotopy\nLegendrian isotopy\nLegendrian isotopy\nLegendrian isotopy\n\u2212 Legendrian stab\n+ Legendrian stab\n\ntransverse\ntransverse\ntransverse\ntransverse\ntransverse\ntransverse\ntransverse\n\nisotopy\nisotopy\nisotopy\nisotopy\nisotopy\nisotopy\nstab\n\nTable 1.

The effect of symmetries of a grid diagram on associated topological structures.\n\nConsider the symmetries S1 , S2 , S3 , and S4 of grid diagrams defined as follows:\n\u2022 S1 rotates the grid diagram 180\u25e6 ;\n\u2022 S2 reflects the diagram about the NE-SW diagonal and interchanges X's and O's;\n\u2022 S3 reflects the diagram across the horizontal axis; and\n\u2022 S4 rotates the grid diagram 180\u25e6 and interchanges X's and O's.\nBoth S1 and S2 preserve topological knot type, while S3 produces the topological mirror\nknot m(K) (with reversed orientation on R3 ), and S4 produces the inverse (i.e., orientationreversed) knot \u2212K.\nThe symmetries descend to the quotient G\u0303 of grid diagrams by translation and commutation. On G\u0303, it is readily checked that the symmetries permute the four X stabilizations as\nshown in Table 2. We will use this information to examine the effect of the symmetries on\nLegendrian and transverse knots and braids, as shown in the table and explained below.\nSince S1 and S2 send X:NE, X:SW stabilizations to themselves or each other, Proposition 2\nimplies that these symmetries descend to maps on L. Indeed, it can be shown (see, e.g.,\n\n\f10\n\nNG, THURSTON\n\n[OST, Lemma 4.6]) that S2 does not change Legendrian isotopy type: L \u25e6 S2 (G) = L(G). It\nfollows also that T \u25e6 S2 (G) = T (G). On the other hand, we have L \u25e6 S1 (G) = \u03bc(L(G)), where\n\u03bc : L \u2192 L is the Legendrian mirror operation, which reflects Legendrian front diagrams in\nthe horizontal axis [FT, OST]. In general, the two maps lead to two distinct Legendrian\nknots [Ng]; note that Legendrian \"mirroring\" preserves topological type. We remark that\nS3 does not descend to a map on L (there is no Legendrian version of the topological mirror\nconstruction), and Legendrian mirrors do not descend to the transverse category.\nThe map S4 on Legendrian knots produces the orientation reverse of the Legendrian mirror:\nL 7\u2192 \u2212\u03bc(L). This operation descends to (oriented) transverse knots, in an operation that\ncould be called the transverse mirror.\nWe next consider braids. Given a grid diagram, there are four equally valid ways to obtain\na map G \u2192 B that preserves topological knot type. One can require that the braid goes from\nleft to right, as we do in Section 2.4, but one could instead require that the braid go from\nbottom to top, right to left, or top to bottom. We write the resulting maps as G 7\u2192 B\u0001 (G),\nG 7\u2192 B\u0002 (G), G 7\u2192 B (G), and G 7\u2192 B\u0003 (G), respectively. In general, these maps lead to four\ndistinct braids, related by\nB\u0001 \u25e6 S1 (G) = B (G)\n\nB\u0001 \u25e6 S2 (G) = B\u0002 (G)\n\nB\u0001 \u25e6 S1 \u25e6 S2 (G) = B\u0003 (G).\n\nAs noted in [KN], it follows from L \u25e6 S2 (G) = L(G) that the braids B\u0001 (G) and B\u0002 (G)\nrepresent the same element of T even though they usually differ in B, and the same is true\nof the pair B (G) and B\u0003 (G). In addition, if we define operations B 7\u2192 m(B) and B 7\u2192 \u2212B\non braids, where m(B) replaces every letter in B by its inverse and \u2212B is the braid word B\nread backwards, then B\u0001 \u25e6 S3 (G) = m(B\u0001 (G)) and B\u0001 \u25e6 S4 (G) = \u2212B\u0001 (G).\nAll symmetries of the NW-NE-SE-SW square are generated by S1 , S2 , S3 . The following\ngeneralization of Proposition 2 is an immediate consequence of the symmetries and Proposition 2.\nCorollary 6.

This involves making several choices:\n\u2022 vertical over horizontal line segments in grid diagrams (vs. horizontal over vertical),\nand Legendrian fronts obtained by 45\u25e6 counterclockwise rotation (vs. clockwise);\n\u2022 transverse knots given by positive pushoffs of Legendrian knots (vs. negative);\n\u2022 braids going from left to right (vs. bottom to top, right to left, top to bottom).\n\n\fGRID DIAGRAMS, BRAIDS, AND CONTACT GEOMETRY\n\n11\n\nThese choices largely agree with the standard conventions in the literature [Cro, Dyn,\nEFM, Et, MOS, MOST]. One can obtain different conventions from ours by applying griddiagram symmetries. For braids, this is discussed above, while for transverse knots, positive\npushoffs become negative pushoffs by applying the symmetry S1 : negative pushoffs are\ntransversely isotopic under X:NW,X:NE,X:SW (de)stabilization.\nFor the knot Floer homology invariant introduced in [OST] and subsequently used in [KN,\nNOT], a slightly different set of conventions is useful. Here an element \u03bb+ of combinatorial\nknot Floer homology HK \u2212 is associated to any grid diagram, and \u03bb+ is shown to be invariant\nunder translation, commutation, and X:NW,X:SW,X:SE (de)stabilization. (Another element\n\u03bb\u2212 is also considered in [OST]; in our notation, \u03bb\u2212 = \u03bb+ \u25e6 S1 .) If we apply symmetry S2 \u25e6 S3\nto a grid diagram G before calculating \u03bb+ , then \u03bb+ becomes an invariant of the transverse\nknot T (G).\nIn [KN, NOT, OST], the map G \u2192 L is thus given by G 7\u2192 (L \u25e6 S2 \u25e6 S3 )(G) rather than\nG 7\u2192 L(G). More explicitly, given a grid diagram, one can use the horizontal-over-vertical\nconvention and 45\u25e6 clockwise rotation to obtain a Legendrian front, as is done in these\npapers. (In particular, to translate from our conventions to those of [KN], first apply S2 \u25e6 S3\nto all grid diagrams.) Note that due to the presence of S3 , \u03bb+ becomes an element of HK \u2212\nof the topological mirror of the transverse knot.\n3. Proof of Proposition 2\nLet B(G) (= B\u2192 (G) from Section 2.5) denote the braid associated to a grid diagram\nG as described in Section 2. Proposition 2 (or, more precisely, the braid statement of\nProposition 2) is a direct consequence of the following stronger result.\nProposition 7. Let G be a grid diagram.\n(1) Changing G by torus translation or X:NE,X:SE (de)stabilization changes B(G) by\nconjugation.\n(2) Changing G by commutation changes B(G) by a combination of conjugation and\nexchange moves.\n(3) The map G 7\u2192 B(G) induces a bijection between G/(translation, commutation, X:NE,\nX:SE (de)stabilization) and B/(conjugation, exchange).\nProof. We first check claims (1) and (2). A quick inspection of braid diagrams reveals that\nchanging a grid diagram G by horizontal commutation or by X:NE or X:SE stabilization\ndoes not change the braid isotopy type of B(G).\nChanging G by horizontal torus translation changes B(G) by conjugation; some portion\nof the beginning of B(G) is moved to the end, or vice versa. See Figure 8.\nNext we claim that changing G by vertical torus translation also changes B(G) by conjugation. Indeed, consider moving the topmost column of G to the bottom. By conjugating\nby a horizontal torus translation if necessary, we may assume that in the relevant row, the O\nlies to the left of the X. Then moving the column keeps the braid unchanged; see Figure 8\nagain.\nFinally, we claim that changing G by a vertical commutation changes B(G) by conjugation\nand/or exchange. Indeed, by conjugating with an appropriate torus translation if necessary,\nwe may assume the following: the two relevant rows are the bottom two rows in the grid\ndiagram; the X and O in the bottom row both lie to the right of the X and O in the row\nabove it; and the bottom right corner of the grid diagram is occupied by an X or O. If X lies\n\n\f12\n\nNG, THURSTON\n\nFigure 8. The effect on B(G) of changing G by horizontal (left) and vertical\n(right) torus translation.

In the other case (upper left), the n-strand\n\u22121\n\u22121\nbraid B(G) changes from B1 \u03c3n\u22121\nB2 \u03c3n\u22121 to B1 \u03c3n\u22121 B2 \u03c3n\u22121\n, an exchange move.\n\nFigure 10. Turning a braid diagram into a rectilinear braid diagram.\nto the left of O in both rows, then the commutation changes B(G) by exchange; otherwise,\nit does not change B(G). See Figure 9.\nWe now establish claim (3). From claims (1) and (2), the map in (3) is well-defined. To\nprove bijectivity, we construct an inverse. Any braid B can be given a rectilinear braid\ndiagram by replacing each crossing by an appropriate rectilinear version; see Figure 10.\nPerturb the resulting rectilinear diagram slightly to another rectilinear diagram for which\nno vertical line segments have the same x-coordinate (i.e., are collinear), and no horizontal\nline segments have the same y-coordinate except for those that are identified when the ends\nof the braid are identified. The perturbed diagram is oriented (from left to right), and each\ncorner can be assigned an X or O in the usual way. The collection of X's and O's forms a\ngrid diagram G(B), and by construction we have B = B(G(B)).\nNote that G(B) depends on the choice of perturbation from rectilinear braid diagram to\ngrid diagram, but a different perturbation simply changes G(B) by commutation. In fact,\n\n\fGRID DIAGRAMS, BRAIDS, AND CONTACT GEOMETRY\n\nB1\n\nB2\n\nB1\n\nB2\n\nB1\n\nB2\n\nB1\n\nB2\n\n13\n\nFigure 11. Accomplishing an exchange move through a sequence of commutation and (de)stabilization moves. The first arrow is given by commutations,\none X:NE destabilization, and one X:SE destabilization; the second is a horizontal commutation; the third is commutations, one X:NE stabilization, and\none X:SE destabilization. See also Figure 12 for the moves corresponding to\nthe first and third arrows.\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n...\nFigure 12. Detail of local moves in the first step of Figure 11. A vertical\ncommutation move is followed by X:NE and X:SE destabilization.\nup to commutation and X:SW,X:SE (de)stabilization, G(B) is well-defined for an isotopy\nclass of braids B. This fact is readily established by examining how G(B) changes when\nthe braid word for B changes by one of the relations \u03c3i \u03c3i\u22121 = \u03c3i\u22121 \u03c3i = 1, \u03c3i \u03c3j = \u03c3j \u03c3i for\n|i \u2212 j| \u2265 2, and \u03c3i \u03c3i+1 \u03c3i = \u03c3i+1 \u03c3i \u03c3i+1 . See [Cro] for details.\nIn addition, changing B by conjugation changes G(B) by horizontal torus translation,\nwhile changing B by an exchange move changes G(B) by a combination of horizontal commutations and X:NE,X:SE (de)stabilizations; see Figures 11 and 12. Thus B induces a map from\nB/(conjugation, exchange) to G/(translation, commutation, X:NE, X:SE (de)stabilization).\nIf we consider G and B as maps between G/(translation, commutation, X:NE, X:SE\n(de)stabilization) and B/(conjugation, exchange), then as noted earlier, B \u25e6 G is the identity,\nand one readily checks that G \u25e6 B is the identity as well. Claim (3) follows, and the proof of\nProposition 7 is complete.\n\u0003\nAcknowledgments\nLLN thanks the participants of the conference \"Knots in Washington XXVI\" for useful\ncomments on a preliminary version of the results presented here.
