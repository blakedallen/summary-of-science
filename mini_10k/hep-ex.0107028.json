The \u03c10 channel was\nextracted from the measured two charged-pion cross section by fitting the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and p\u03c0 + invariant\nmasses. The low momentum transfer region shows the typical diffractive pattern expected from\nReggeon-exchange. The flatter behavior at large \u2212t cannot be explained solely in terms of QCDinspired two-gluon exchange models. The data indicate that other processes, like quark interchange,\nare important to fully describe \u03c1 photoproduction.\nPACS : 13.60.Le , 12.40.Nn, 13.40.Gp\n\nWe report the results of \u03c10 meson photoproduction on\nprotons for E\u03b3 between 3.19 and 3.91 GeV. Data have\nbeen measured over the \u2212t range from 0.1 \u2212 5.0 GeV2 using the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS)\nat the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility\n(TJNAF). The low momentum transfer region (\u2212t < 1\nGeV2 ), already measured in previous experiments [1,2] at\nsimilar energies, shows a diffractive behavior interpreted\nin the framework of the Vector Meson Dominance (VMD)\nmodel [3] as the elastic scattering of vector mesons off the\nproton target. In a more recent approach, this process is\nalso described by the t-channel exchange of the Pomeron,\nscalar \u03c3 meson [4,5], and f2 (1270) Regge trajectories [6].\nAt high \u2212t, where the cross section is sensitive to\nthe microscopic details of the interaction, the underlying\nphysics can be described using parton degrees of freedom.\nIn a QCD-inspired\nframework, the small impact param\u221a\neter (\u2248 1/ \u2212t) prevents the constituent gluons (quarks)\nof the exchange from interacting and forming a Pomeron\n(Reggeon). Within certain models [7,8] this means that\nthe constituents can be resolved into two-gluon (twoquark) structures (Fig. 1-a). Moreover, small transverse\nsizes select configurations where each gluon couples to\ndifferent quarks both in the vector meson [8] and the nucleon [9], giving access to the correlation function in the\nproton (Fig. 1-b) [6]. The recent CLAS measurement of\nthe \u03c6 photoproduction cross section [10], where the quark\nexchange is strongly suppressed by the OZI rule, was able\nto isolate the contribution due to two-gluon exchange. In\nthe \u03c1 case, its light quark composition also allows valence\nquarks to be exchanged between the baryon and the meson states (Fig. 1-c) [6].\nA bremsstrahlung photon beam was produced by an\nE0 = 4.1 GeV continuous electron beam hitting a gold radiator of 10\u22124 radiation lengths. The Hall B tagging system [11], with a photon energy resolution of 0.1% E0 , was\nused to tag photons in the energy range from 3.19 \u2212 3.91\nGeV. The target cell, a mylar cylinder 6 cm in diameter\nand 18 cm long, was filled with liquid hydrogen at 20.4 K.\nDuring data taking at high intensity (\u223c 4 * 106 \u03b3/s), the\nphoton flux was continuously measured by an e+ e\u2212 pair\nspectrometer located beyond the target. The efficiency\nof this device was determined during dedicated low intensity (\u223c 105 \u03b3/s ) runs by comparison with a 100% efficient\n\nlead-glass total absorption counter. The systematic uncertainty on the photon flux has been estimated to be\n3% [10].\n\nFIG. 1.\nThe Feynman diagrams corresponding to a)\ntwo-gluon exchange from a single quark, b) two-gluon exchange taking into account quark correlations in the nucleon,\nand c) quark exchange.\n\nThe hadrons were detected in CLAS [12], a spectrometer with nearly 4\u03c0 coverage that is based on a toroidal\nmagnetic field (\u223c 1T ) generated by six superconducting\ncoils. The field was set to bend the positive particles\naway from the beam into the acceptance of the detector.\nThree drift chamber regions allowed tracking of charged\nparticles [13] and time-of-flight scintillators (TOF) were\nused for hadron identification [14]. The momentum resolution was of the order of a few percent, while the detector geometric acceptance was about 70% for protons and\npositive pions. Low energy negative particles, however,\nwere mainly lost at forward angles because they were\nbent out of the acceptance. Coincidences between the\nphoton tagger and the CLAS detector (TOFs) triggered\nthe recording of hadronic interactions. From a total of\n70M triggers, 0.8M events were identified as p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 candidates.\nThe five-fold differential cross section\nd\u03c3(\u03b3p \u2192 p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\nd\u03c3\n\u2261\ndecay\nd\u03c4\ndM\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 dMp\u03c0+ d\u03c6cm\ndt\n\u03c1 d\u03c6\u03c0 +\n\n(1)\n\n\fwas measured by analyzing all possible event topologies\nof the reaction \u03b3p \u2192 p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 with at least two detected\nhadrons in the final state (p\u03c0 + , p\u03c0 \u2212 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ),\nusing the missing mass and missing energy techniques to\neliminate the underlying multi-pion background.\nThe CLAS acceptance and reconstruction efficiency\nwere evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations. An event\ngenerator [15] was used that contained the three main\ncontributions to the p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state (\u03b3p \u2192 p\u03c10 , \u03b3p \u2192\n\u2206++ \u03c0 \u2212 , and \u03b3p \u2192 p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in s-wave), along with background reactions with three or more pions. The generated events were processed by a GEANT-based code simulating the CLAS detector that reconstructed the simulated data using the same analysis procedure applied to\nthe raw data. To minimize the model dependence, the\nacceptance was derived as a function of six independent\nkinematic variables describing the full three-body reaction, namely, E\u03b3 , the two invariant masses Mp\u03c0+ and\nM\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 , the \u03c10 center-of-mass azimuthal angle \u03c6cm\n\u03c1 , the\ndecay\n+\n0\n\u03c0 azimuthal angle in the \u03c1 helicity frame \u03c6\u03c0+ , and\nthe momentum transfer t. For each detected topology,\nthe data were binned in the six dimensional space and\ncorrected, bin by bin, by the corresponding acceptance.\nDepending on the kinematics, the average acceptance of\nCLAS for these final states ranges from 5% to 15%.\nEach topology predominantly covers complementary\nkinematic regions. Combining all event topologies together, we were able to measure almost the entire allowed\nphase space. For \u2212t < 0.1 GeV2 the CLAS detector had\nno acceptance for the reaction. When multiple topologies\nwere present in the same kinematic region, we considered\neach topology as an independent measurement of the two\npion cross section. Their comparison gave an evaluation\nof the systematic uncertainty on the cross section ranging\nfrom 5% to 10%, depending on the kinematics.\nTo determine the relative weight of different channels\nthat contribute to the p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 final state, the two differential cross sections d2 \u03c3/dtdM\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 and d2 \u03c3/dtdMp\u03c0+ were\nsimultaneously fit to a phenomenological model [16\u201318]\nthat describes two-pion production as a superposition\nof three-body phase space and quasi-two-body channels\n(\u03b3p \u2192 p\u03c10 , \u03b3p \u2192 pf2 (1270), \u03b3p \u2192 \u2206++ \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03b3p \u2192 \u22060 \u03c0 + )\nwith subsequent decays. This model describes the cross\nsection as the sum of six amplitudes:\n2\n\n6\nX\nd\u03c3\nai T i .\n=\nd\u03c4\ni=1\n\n(2)\n\nThe complex reaction amplitudes Ti correspond to: 1)\ndiffractive processes in the \u03b3p \u2192 p\u03c10 reaction (Pomeron\nand f2 (1270) Regge trajectory exchanges); 2) u-channel\nexchange in \u03b3p \u2192 p\u03c10 (nucleon trajectory); 3) Born\nterms in the \u03b3p \u2192 \u2206++ \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03b3p \u2192 \u22060 \u03c0 + reactions (contact and \u03c0-in-flight) treated in a Regge approach [19]; 4) \u03c10 Regge trajectory exchange in the reaction \u03b3p \u2192 pf2 (1270); 5) s-channel resonance excitation\n\nfor p\u03c10 , \u2206++ \u03c0 \u2212 , and \u22060 \u03c0 + (20 well-established resonances were included in the model even though the main\ncontributions come from the F35 (1905), F37 (1950), and\nthe G17 (2190)); 6) a phase space parameterized as a real\nconstant number in each (W, t) bin. The \u03c10 and \u2206++\ndecay amplitudes were evaluated using an effective Lagrangian model with the form factors as given in Ref. [20].\n\nFIG. 2.\nThe measured invariant mass distribution,\nM\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 , and the fitted quasi-two-body contributions in two\nt bins: 0.2 \u2212 0.3 GeV2 and 3.0 \u2212 3.5 GeV2 . The solid line\ncorresponds to the coherent sum of different channels.\n\nFigure 2 shows typical invariant mass distributions in\na low and a high t bin, and the fitted decomposition into\nthe two-body channels. The real fit parameters ai , determined in each t bin using MINUIT [21], show a smooth\nand small dependence on t, indicating that this model\ncan provide a reasonable description of the data.\nTo evaluate the model dependence, the \u03c1 channel separation was also performed by means of a procedure similar to that used in the ZEUS data analysis [22], fitting\nthe M\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 distribution with a third-order polynomial\nbackground plus Breit-Wigner-shaped lines and an interference term. The extracted \u03c10 cross section agrees\nwithin 10% to 30% with the results obtained using the\nphenomenological model. A full description of the data\nanalysis can be found in Ref. [23].\nThe extracted \u03c10 photoproduction cross section as a\nfunction of t is presented in Fig. 3 for E\u03b3 = 3.8 GeV.\nIn the low momentum transfer region good agreement\nwith the previous measurement of Ref. [1] is evident.\n\n\fAssuming an exponential AeBt behavior in the range\n0.1 < \u2212t < 0.5 GeV2 , the coefficient resulting from this\nexperiment, B = \u22126.4 \u00b1 0.3 GeV\u22122 , is consistent with\nthe value B = \u22126.9 \u00b1 0.4 GeV\u22122 quoted in Ref. [1]. The\nexisting data at large momentum transfer were taken at\nSLAC [24] with a bremsstrahlung photon beam and a single arm spectrometer; the signal was unfolded from the\nbackground using a Breit-Wigner fit but the incomplete\ndetection of the final state did not allow separation of\nthe \u03c9 channel from the \u03c10 channel, the latter comprising\n50-75% of the data set.\n\nmodel the gluons can couple to any quark in the \u03c1 meson\nand in the baryon (see Fig. 1-a,b) and quark correlations\nin the proton are taken into account assuming the simplest form of its wave function with three valence quarks\nequally sharing the proton longitudinal momentum [25].\n\nFIG. 4. The energy dependence of the \u03c10 photoproduction\nd\u03c3/dt as measured in CLAS.\n\nFIG. 3. The differential \u03c10 photoproduction cross section\n(see text for detailed explanation of the curves). The error\nbars include statistical and systematic uncertainties summed\nin quadrature.\n\nPredictions from presently available models are also\nshown in Fig. 3. The dashed line corresponds to the\nphenomenological model used for the channel separation\nassuming that the parameters ai of equation (2) are independent of t. In this model, the Pomeron and f2 (1270)\nRegge trajectory exchanges (dotted line) describe the low\nmomentum transfer region, while the large \u2212t flat behavior is reproduced by the tails of resonances having a sizeable branch in the \u03c1 channel. The overall resonance coupling was found to be compatible with what is expected\nby extrapolating from the low W region by means of a\nBreit-Wigner shape with an energy-dependent width.\nIn the QCD-inspired model of Refs. [6,9] (dot-dashed\nline on Fig. 3), the Pomeron exchange has been replaced\nby the exchange of two non-perturbatively dressed gluons. At low \u2212t the good agreement with the data is\nobtained adding the f2 (1270) and the \u03c3 Regge trajectories, while the rise at large \u2212t is given by the Reggeized\nu-channel exchange (N and \u2206 trajectories) [6]. In this\n\nThe QCD-inspired model describes \u03c6 photoproduction\nover the entire t range in our energy region [10], as well\nas the higher energy \u03c10 SLAC results (E\u03b3 \u223c 6 GeV) [6]\nwhere two-gluon exchange is also expected to dominate.\nInstead, as shown in Fig. 3, the model underestimates\nthe CLAS data, leaving room for quark-exchange processes (Fig. 1-c). As explained in Refs. [19,26,27] these\nhard-scattering mechanisms can be incorporated in an\neffective way by using the so called \"saturated\" trajectory. Regge trajectories are usually linear in t but are\nexpected to \"saturate\", i.e. be t-independent, at large\nmomentum transfer [28]. The trajectory has been chosen as \u03b1(t) = \u22121 when \u2212t > 3 GeV2 [6] to be compatible\nwith quark counting rules [26].\nThe solid line in Fig. 3 shows the full calculation, including such saturating trajectory. Quark exchange increases the cross section at large \u2212t by a factor two.\nFigure 4 shows the measured cross sections in different photon energy bins. From the three data sets, the\n\u03c10 cross section at \u03b8cm = 90\u25e6 is extracted as a function\nof energy. The power law s\u2212C fit to d\u03c3/dt at 90\u25e6 in\nthe center of mass is performed using both SLAC [2,24]\nand CLAS data. The fit yields C = 7.9 \u00b1 0.3 (\u03c72 = 0.6)\nshowing a good agreement with s\u22128 behavior. The quark\nexchange diagrams of Fig. 1-c-left (point-like interaction)\nand 1-c-right (hadronic component of the photon) have a\n\n\fs\u22127 and s\u22128 power-law behavior respectively, both by dimensional counting [26] and by recent models [29]. Note\nthat also the saturated \u03c3 Regge trajectory behaves like\ns\u22128 . Like the differential cross section at fixed energy, the\ns dependence suggests the presence of quark interchange\nhard mechanisms in addition to the two-gluon exchange\nprocess.\nIn conclusion, the full differential two charged-pion\ncross section was measured for the first time over a large\nangular range. The differential cross section for \u03b3p \u2192 p\u03c10\nwas derived by fitting the M\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 and Mp\u03c0+ mass distributions with a realistic phenomenological model. The\ncomparison with available models provides indications\nof the presence of hard processes. Adopting a QCD\nlanguage in this energy region, the two-gluon exchange\nmechanisms (that fully describe the \u03c6 photoproduction\ndata) are not sufficient to reproduce the cross section\nat large momentum transfer and its energy dependence.\nGood agreement is achieved when quark interchange processes (suppressed in \u03c6 production) are included in an\neffective way in the calculation for the \u03c10 production.\nWe would like to acknowledge the outstanding efforts of the staff of the Accelerator and the Physics\nDivisions at JLab that made this experiment possible.\nThis work was supported in part by the Italian Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, the French Centre\nNational de la Recherche Scientifique and Commissariat\n\u00e0 l'Energie Atomique, the U.S. Department of Energy\nand National Science Foundation, and the Korea Science\nand Engineering Foundation.
