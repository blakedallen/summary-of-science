Wang\nLaGuardia Community College of the City University of New York\nThe general public has been made aware of the research field of Chaos by the book of\nthat title by James Gleick.1 Since the publication of that best seller in 1987, the term\n\u2015chaos\u2016 has become a trendy word, and the title of the leading chapter \u2015butterfly effect\u2016\nis a household name. While the idea of chaos seemed to emerge recently, it actually\narose from the prize-winning work of one of the greatest mathematicians of the late\nnineteenth century-Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1854\u20131912). Poincar\u00e9's 1890 memoir on the threebody problem was the result of his entry in King Oscar II of Sweden's 60th birthday\ncompetition. The Russian mathematician, Sonya Kovalevskaya (1850\u20131891), then a\nprofessor of the University of Stockholm, was consulted in the offering of the prize.\nAbout the same time, she finished her own celebrated work on the motion of a rigid\nbody.2 From today's point of view, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, the works of\nPoincar\u00e9 and Kovalevskaya hinted at the failure of Newtonian determinism by using\nNewton's own laws. The implication is that chaos is ubiquitous.\nThe butterfly effect3 is often ascribed to the meteorologist Edward Lorenz (1917\u20132008),\nand the numerical simulations of three simple equations named after him are favorite\nimages for textbooks and magazines. Freeman Dyson pointed out that Mary Lucy\nCartwright (1900\u20131998) and John Edensor Littlewood (1885\u20131977) studied the chaoslike behavior in the equation for a radio amplifier known as the van der Pol oscillator\nduring World War II, predating Lorenz's work by decades.4 In Lorenz's own book The\nEssence of Chaos,5 he elaborated the crucial influence of the study by Littlewood and\nCartwright. Why did the work of Lorenz precipitate an enthusiastic public response\nwhile the work of Cartwright and Littlewood 20 years earlier did not? Dyson believed\nthat the change of style in mathematics is one of the reasons. The new mathematics is\nvisual rather than analytical: chaos theory flourished and became popular because\ncomputers were able to simulate motions accurately and display them dramatically. This\nexplanation might also apply to the situation of Kovalevskaya, whose analytical approach\nto the rigid body problem was a tour de force, but is under appreciated by contemporary\nmathematicians and physicists. The purpose of this paper is to revisit Kovalevskaya's\nand Cartwright's mathematical works and place them in proper historical perspective in\nthe development of chaos theory.

Galileo noticed that the\nmotion of a chandelier hanging in a cathedral oscillated with a constant period, and\nKepler analyzed voluminous astronomical data and revealed regular elliptical orbits for\nthe planets. Newton was able to show that the regular swinging of a pendulum and the\ntrajectory of planets follow from his laws of motion. His second law ( F \uf03d ma ) is in the\nform of differential equations, which relate not just quantities, but also the rates at which\nthose quantities changes. Since Newton, differential equations have been proven to be\nthe most effective ways to express theories of physics; they constitute a powerful tool to\npredict natural phenomena surrounding us, like the vibrations of a string, the ripples on\nthe surface of a pond, and the forever evolving patterns of the weather. The revolution in\nscientific thought that culminated in Newton led to a vision of the universe as some\ngigantic mechanism, functioning like clockwork.\nThe great success of Newton's theory had an unfortunate consequence in education. By\nsolving textbook problems of pendulum oscillations and planetary motion using routine\nmethods, students got the impression that mechanics is about writing the differential\nequations of motion and finding the analytical solutions. They were led to an erroneous\nimpression that all motions were periodic based on idealized simplifications, and that\nmore difficult problems involved merely technical refinements, which can be solved\nusing more powerful computers.\nIn spite of the great elegance and simplicity of Newton's treatment of the motion of\ncelestial bodies (with subsequent improvements by Bernoulli and others), the\ninvestigation cannot be regarded as complete. The solar system consists of planets, their\nmoons, comets, and asteroids, but the canonical treatment is to consider two bodies only\nand ignore the rest. For a long term prediction of planetary motion, it is necessary to\nconsider additional bodies in the system. The three-body problem was a natural first step\nand captured the imagination of mathematicians since Newton. Yet other than some\nrestricted situations, no general solution has been obtained. It was considered to be so\nimportant that in 1885 King Oscar II of Sweden offered a prize of 2500 crowns7 for the\nsolution to the three-body problem. Like others before him, Poincar\u00e9 failed to solve the\nequations. But unlike others he solved the problem in a very different sense: he proved\nthat the equations could not be solved. Through attacking the three-body problem,\nPoincar\u00e9 had laid the foundations for the modern approach to dynamical systems using\ntopology.\nAnother important application of Newtonian mechanics occurs in the study of the motion\nof a rigid body. The period formula ( T \uf03d 2\uf070 l / g ) and the solution (a sinusoidal\n6\n\nContact the author at fwang@lagcc.cuny.edu for supplemental materials; some electronic documents are\navailable at http://faculty.lagcc.cuny.edu/fwang.\n7\nFor comparison, the annual salary of a top professor such as G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler was 7000 crowns.\n\n2\n\n\ffunction) that students learn early in school is based on the assumption that the bob is a\npoint oscillating on a plane. A rigid body problem is a generalization from a point to an\nextended body rotating in a three-dimensional space. Like the three-body problem, the\nrigid body problem also attracted the attention of many great mathematicians. Euler\nstudied the case that gravity is indifferent, and Lagrange focused on a symmetric rigid\nbody. There was no progress for 100 years after Lagrange's work (1788), until\nKovalevskaya made a breakthrough. Her result is best described in a letter that she sent\nto G\u00f6tta Mittag-Leffler in 1886:8\nDear Sir,\nI thank you for your invitation for tomorrow, and I shall come with pleasure.

Kovalevskaya's letter highlights her two achievements. First she\nset a new case of the motion of a rigid body, and gave a solution in terms of hyperelliptic\nfunctions.9 Furthermore, she proved that with the exception of three cases it is\nimpossible to find a general solution of the problem of motion of a rigid body in terms of\nanalytic functions.\nThe achievements of Kovalevskaya and Poincar\u00e9 were their realization that in general\none cannot find analytical solutions that would describe the position of the rigid bodies or\nplanets at all times. Traditionally, a differential equation is solved by finding a function\nthat satisfied the equation; a trajectory is then determined by starting the solution with a\n8\n\nThe letter was written in French; this English translation is by Roger Cooke in The Mathematics of Sonya\nKovalevskaya, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1984.\n9\n\nAn integral of the form\n\n\uf0f2\n\nx\n\n0\n\ndu / P(u ) is called an elliptic integral if P(u) is a polynomial of either the\n\nthird or the forth degree. If P(u ) is of degree higher than the forth, the integrall is called Abelian or\nhyperelliptic.\n\n3\n\n\fparticular initial condition. Before the discoveries of Poincar\u00e9 and Kovalevskaya, it was\nthought that a nonlinear system would always have a solution; we just needed to be\nclever enough to find it. But such a view is wrong. Kovalevskaya and Poincar\u00e9 showed\nthat no matter how clever we are, we will not be able to solve most of the differential\nequations. The belief in determinism, that the present state of the world determines the\nfuture precisely, was shattered.\nAlthough Kovalevskaya's portrait can be found in many mathematics departments'\ngalleries, most people have the vaguest idea about her contributions. One possible reason\nis Dyson's \u2015analytical versus visual\u2016 argument. Among the three analytically solvable\nrigid body cases, the Kovalevskaya case is the most complicated and the most difficult\none. She followed the analytical tradition of Lagrange, which is intrinsically tedious. In\nLagrange's M\u00e9canique Analytique, he attempted to mold the whole system of mechanics\ninto analytical mathematical equations, and was proud of the fact that one would not find\na single diagram in his work. Kovalevskaya's calculations extended over 50 pages,\ninvolving elliptic functions unfamiliar to today's scholars and students. Furthermore,\nKovalevskaya's mathematical accomplishments and her relationship to the mathematical\ncommunity of her time have been subjected to distortion, particularly by E. T. Bell's\nclassic Men of Mathematics, in which he implied that Kovalevskaya's mentor Karl\nWeierstrass did most of the work. Without a question, Weierstrass (1815\u20131897) was the\nmost influential mathematician in Kovalevskaya's career. He is regarded as the father of\nmodern analysis; his definitions of limit and derivative are what today's students learn in\ntheir calculus course. It is true that Weierstrass suggested Kovalevskaya work on the\nproblem, but Kovalevskaya was the first person to apply the ideas of the theory of\nfunctions of a complex variable developed by Cauchy, Riemann, and Weierstrass to the\nsolution of a dynamical problem. The passages in Bell's book seem haughtily\npatronizing and freighted with inappropriate innuendo.10\nEven in the mathematical physics circle, while the Euler11 and Lagrange cases are\nincluded in commonly used classical mechanics textbooks such as those by Goldstein,12\nby Landau and Liftshitz,13 and by Arnold,14 Kovalevskaya's theorem and her treatment of\nher own case are unknown to students and even professors. To prepare students for\nfuture studies, educators must emphasize the limited solvability in mechanical systems.\nInstead of finding the individual solutions of differential equations, the modern emphasis\nhas been shifted from finding a local solution to a global solution by applying\ngeometrical and topological techniques. It is understandable that Kovalevskaya's\nintricate transformation of the integrals of motion to elliptic functions might be of interest\nto aficionados only, but students can apply numerical methods to visualize the actual\n10\n\nFor example, on page 426 of Men of Mathematics Bell wrote: \u2015Man's ingratitude to man is a familiar\nenough theme; Sonja now demonstrated what a woman can do in that line when she puts her mind to it.\nShe did not answer her old friend's letter for two years although she knew had had been unhappy and in\npoor health.

The major exceptions were A. Lyapunov in Russia and G. D. Birkhoff in\nAmerica, who continued to advance classical mechanics in the early twentieth century.\nIn England a gulf had formed between the pure and applied mathematics; this situation\nwas reflected in G. H. Hardy's essay A Mathematician's Apology, in which he declared\nthat pure mathematics must be useless. In 1938, the Second World War was pending,\nand Britain was belatedly preparing to defend itself. The most important technical\ninstrument for the defense of Britain was radar. But at that time, the deployment of radar\nwas greatly hampered by the lack of reliable high-powered radio amplifiers. The Radio\nResearch Board of the U. K. Department of Scientific and Industrial Research issued a\ncall for help, requesting the \u2015really expert guidance\u2016 of pure mathematicians with\n\u2015certain types of non-linear differential equations involved in the technique of radio\nengineering.\u2016 Mary Cartwright responded to the appeal. Prior to it, she studied under\nHardy in the late 1920s, and obtained her D.Phil. from Oxford in 1930. One of her\nexaminers was Littlewood. Littlewood had a rather eccentric personality, and it was\nnotoriously difficult to work with him. Mary Cartwright intuitively recognized the\ntopological features of the van der Pol oscillator, and was able to bring it to Littlewood's\nattention.15\nCartwright and Littlewood began studying the van der Pol equation just before the War,\nand the collaboration lasted approximately a decade. They published four joint papers;\ntheir paper entitled \u2015On Non-Linear Differential Equations of the Second Order: I. The\nEquation \uf026y\uf026 \uf02d k (1 \uf02d y 2 ) y\uf026 \uf02b y \uf03d b\uf06ck cos(\uf06ct \uf02b a) , k Large\u2016 in Journal of the London\n\n15\n\nS. L. McMurran and J. J.

Cartwright and Littlewood noticed that for some\nparameter ranges, two distinct stable subharmonic motions were obtained, and for some\nother parameter ranges the Poincar\u00e9 section possessed a great variety of structures. They\nwere puzzled by their result, but were confident about its validity because van der Pol had\nfound a similar phenomenon experimentally.17 Specifically, van der Pol reported that\n\u2015often an irregular noise is heard in the telephone receivers before the frequency jumps to\nthe next lower value\u2016 in a letter to Nature.18 In the caption of Figure 2 the reader can find\ntechnical explanations, and it is easy to employ Mathematica to simulate the sound that\nwas heard by van der Pol. The observation of Cartwright and Little implied the existence\nof a \u2015strange attractor,\u2016 which is neither a point nor a curve in the Poincar\u00e9 section.\n\n2\nFigure 2: Numerical solutions to \uf026y\uf026 \uf02d k (1 \uf02d y ) y\uf026 \uf02b y \uf03d b\uf06ck cos(\uf06ct \uf02b a ) , with\n\nk \uf03d 5 , \uf06c \uf03d 2.466 ,\n\na \uf03d 0 , and b values indicated in the figure.

A periodic motion of least period n \uf076 is called a subharmonic of order\nn . For b \uf03d 0.3 and b \uf03d 0.5 , there are a finite number of periodic motion (5 and 3, respectively). For\nb \uf03d 0.4055 , the Poincar\u00e9 section shows an infinite number of periodic motion of a great variety of\n\u2015structures\u2016 described by Cartwright and Littlewood; such a structure is called a strange attractor in modern\nterms.\nAlthough the paper of Cartwright and Littlewood announced groundbreaking results, the\nyear 1945 was a bad time to publish. Paper in England was scarce and few copies of the\nJournal containing Cartwright's paper were printed; the paper attracted little attention. In\n1949, Cartwright was invited to lecture on nonlinear differential equations at Princeton\n16\n\nM. L. Cartwright and J. E.

Cartwright later learned that if\nher host, Solomon Lefschetz, stopped asking questions for five minutes, he was asleep.\nFortunately, the significance of Cartwright's work was understood by Norman Levinson,\nwho gave a simpler analysis.19 Their works led to Stephen Smale's introduction of the\nhorseshoe map.\nThe reputation of Steve Smale (born in 1930) was not confined to mathematics. He said\nthat his best work had been done \u2015on the beaches of Rio.\u201620 He used this beaches\nreference to mock Washington politicians. In 1960, Smale was in Rio de Janeiro as a\npostdoctoral fellow sponsored by the U. S. National Science Foundation. His antiwar\nactivities in the 1960s created a furor in Washington. In 1966, while the U. S. House UnAmerican Activities Committee was trying to subpoena him, he was heading for Moscow\nto attend the International congress of Mathematics. There he received the Fields Medal,\nthe most prestigious prize in mathematics. Subsequently, questions were raised about his\nhaving used U. S. taxpayers' money for this research on the beaches of Rio. Smale\nrecalled that shortly after his arrival in Rio, Levinson wrote him a letter pointing out a\nmistake in a conjecture Smale just published. The conjecture was \u2015chaos doesn't exist!\u2016\nSmale eventually convinced himself that Levinson was correct, as chaos was already\nimplicit in the analyses of Cartwright and Littlewood. Through geometrizing the\nanalytical results of Cartwright, Littlewood and Levinson, Smale invented the horseshoe\nmap (on the beach), the driving mechanism and cornerstone of the whole modern theory\nof chaos. The idea also led Smale to a solution of Poincar\u00e9's Conjecture in dimensions\ngreater than 4, and it was for that work he received the Fields Medal.\nA fascinating aspect about chaos is that such a phenomenon arises in diverse fields.\nFrom a statistical-mechanical view, heat is the manifestation of randomly jiggling\nmolecules, thus chaos is actually desirable. In early 1950s, Enrico Fermi, John Pasta and\nStan Ulam set to study how a crystal evolves toward thermal equilibrium using one of the\nvery first computers, the MANIAC. They numerically integrated the differential\nequation, and expected a stochastic motion. To their surprise, they found the motion to\nbe highly regular. The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) problem, first written up in a Los\nAlamos Report in May 1955,21 marked the beginning of both a new field, nonlinear\nphysics (which is of central importance in the theory of chaos), and the age of computer\nsimulations of scientific problems. Fermi died of cancer in 1954, and the report never\nturned into a peer-reviewed paper. Readers of that report might be puzzled by the\nauthorship credit, which reads \u2015Work done by E. Fermi, J. Pasta, S. Ulam, M. Tsingou,\nReport written by E. Fermi, J. Pasta, S. Ulam.\u2016 On page 3, a footnote reads \u2015We thank\nMiss Mary Tsingou for efficient coding of the problems and for running the computations\non the Los Alamos MANIAC machine.\u2016 Here we encountered another unsung heroine,\nwhose identity remained little-known until a recent article published in Physics Today.22\n19\n\nN.

Fermi, Pasta and Ulam were\nextremely fortunate to find Mary Tsingou, who programmed the dynamics, ensured its\naccuracy, and provide graphs of the results.23 After Fermi's death, Jim Tuck and Mary\nMenzel (n\u00e9e Tsingou) repeated the original FPU results and provided strong indication\nthat the nonlinear FPU problem might be integrable.24\n\nFigure 3: Nested KAM tori sketch in Ergodic Problems of Classical Mechanics by V. I. Arnold and A.\nAvez. Some tori persist, and some replaced by chaos. The remaining tori set up barriers which prevent the\nchaotic trajectories form drifting indiscriminately all over.\n\nThe FPU paradox forced physicists to face some of their deepest insecurities.25 Classical\nmechanicians thought that the few-body problem was analytically solvable, but Poincar\u00e9\nrecognized that the three-body problem could be chaotic. Taking the opposite tack,\nstatistical mechanicians asserted that the many-body problem was stochastic, but the FPU\ncomputer calculations revealed the motion to be highly ordered. How to resolve these\ncontradictions? At the International Mathematical Congress of 1954, A. N. Kolmogorov\n(1903\u20131987) gave a closing lecture in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. He suggested a\ntheorem (without proof), which, though no one noticed at the time, could have explained\nthe lack of chaos observed by FPU. The details of Kolmogorov's theorem were later\nworked out by V. I. Arnold (born in 1937) and J\u00fcrgen Moser (1928\u20131999), now known\nas the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem. In modern terms, an integrable\n\n23\n\nStudents can repeat Tsingou's task with 15 lines of Matlab code; see T. Dauxois, M.

The KAM theorem states that\nunder perturbation, most tori do not vanish, but are only slightly deformed. But some tori\ndo get destroyed and replaced by chaos. The chaos-creating mechanism is similar to the\nhorseshoe map. Indeed, after showing the impossibility of solving the differential\nequations of planetary motion, Poincar\u00e9 discovered the inevitability of homoclinic\ntangles, which turned out to be the trademark of chaos. In his own words,\nThe complexity of this figure will be striking, and I shall not even try to draw it. Nothing is more\nsuitable for providing us with an idea of the complex nature of the three-body problem, and all the\nproblems of dynamics in general, where there is no uniform integral and where the Bohlin series\nare divergent.\n\nThe figure Poincar\u00e9 would not draw is shown in Figure 3, along with a numerical\napproximation based on the standard map.27 One opinion popularly held in the 1950s\nwas that the addition of perturbation would render the system chaotic, but we can observe\nfrom Figure 3 that nonlinearity is not enough to guarantee complete chaos, as the\nremaining tori set up barriers which prevent the chaotic regions from drifting\nindiscriminately all over phase space. Most orbits are confined to specific regions of\nphase and remain so indefinitely. One application of the KAM theorem was to address\nthe issue of the stability of the solar system, which has been debated since the eighteenth\ncentury. Because the KAM tori set up barriers to prevent chaos from spreading, one\nmight be inclined to call the solar system stable, at least philosophically.\nThe KAM theorem represents a unified formulation of the complicated structure of\nregular and irregular trajectories; we hope that this paper will make readers aware of\npioneer works done by remarkable women: Kovalevskaya's contribution to the theorem\nof non-integrability, and Cartwright's insight into the chaos-like topological structure.\nPedagogically speaking, a good share of physics and mathematics is still writing\ndifferential equations on a blackboard and showing students how to solve them.\nAlthough it is impractical to change the conventional curriculum drastically, it is possible\nto introduce some innovations. The unforced van der Pol equation is a standard topic in\ndifferential equations textbooks, and it is a feasible project for students go one step\nfurther to investigate the equation Cartwright studied.28 Integrable systems are the basis\nfor the KAM formulation, and among those few integrable systems, the Kovalevskaya\ncase is arguably the most beautiful one. Kovalevskaya's method can provide a test for\nintegrability,29 and the Kharlamov's bifurcation analysis30 of the integral manifolds\nserves as an excellent example for analyzing the nontrivial nesting of invariant tori. We\nurge more educators to make Kovalevskaya's legacy accessible to undergraduate students.\n\n26\n\nA most popular example of a two-dimensional torus is a donut-shaped surface.\nSee \u2015Standard Map on a Torus,\u2016 http://faculty.lagcc.cuny.edu/fwang/smap/standardmap.html.\n28\nThis paper might be useful for instructor to design projects for students: U.
