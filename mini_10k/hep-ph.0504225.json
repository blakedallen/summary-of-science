INTRODUCTION\nIs modern theory able to explain the origin of observed matter in the Universe by its cosmological production from a vacuum [1-11]? As is well known,\nthe answer to this question is associated with the problem of particle creation\nin the vicinity of a cosmological singularity. Thus far, it has been common\npractice to assume that the number of product pairs is by far insufficient for\nexplaining the total amount of observed matter [7].\nWe recall that the cosmological creation of massive particles is calculated\nby going over to conformal variables [7], for which the limit of zero scale factor\n(point of a cosmic singularity) means the vanishing of masses. Vector bosons\nare the only particles of the Standard Model that have a singularity at zero\nmass [12, 13]. In this limit, the normalization of the wave function for massive\nvector bosons is singular in mass [12, 13]. The absence of the massless limit\nin the theory of massive vector bosons is well known [14]. In calculations\nin the lowest order of perturbation theory this leads to a divergence of the\nnumber of product longitudinal bosons [7, 11].\n1)\n\nE-mail: pervush@thsun1.jinr.ru\n\n\fThere are two opinions concerning the removal of this singularity. In [7, 15]\nthe divergence of the number of particles is removed by means of a standard\nrenormalization of the gravitational constant. However, it is also indicated\nin the monograph of Grib et al. [7] that the number of product particles\nis determined by the imaginary part of loop Feynman diagrams; since, in\nquantum field theory, it is the real parts of these diagrams that are subjected\nto renormalization. This means that the above divergence of the number of\nparticles does not belong to the class of divergences in quantum field theory\nthat are removed by means of a conventional renormalization of physical\nquantities. Indeed, the physical origin of this divergence is that the problem\nof a cosmological creation of particles from a vacuum is treated within an\nidealized formulation. The point is that the quantum production of particles\nin a finite volume for a system featuring interaction and exchange effects\nmay lead to a set of Bose particles having a specific statistical distribution\nwith respect to energy such that it is able to ensure the convergence of the\nrespective integral of the momentum distribution.\nIn the present study, we analyze physical conditions and models for which\nthe number of product vector bosons maybe quite sufficient for explaining the\norigin of matter in the Universe. Such cosmological models include conformal\ncosmology [16], where conformal quantities of the general theory of relativity\nand of the Standard Model are defined as observables [17] for which there are\nrelative reference units of intervals.\nThe ensuing exposition is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to\ndiscussing various versions of the formulation of the Cauchy problem for the\ncosmological production of vector particles in field theory. In Section 3 we\nstudy possible implications of such a production in the context of validating the temperature of cosmic microwave background radiation within the\nStandard Model, the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the Universe [18, 19],\n\n2\n\n\fand a small contribution of visible baryon matter [20] to the evolution of the\nUniverse. In the Conclusion we discuss the results obtained by calculating\nthe composition of matter in the Universe within the Standard Model.\n\n2. PROBLEM OF COSMOLOGICAL PARTICLE CREATION\n2.1. Theory\nLet us consider cosmological particle creation in the conformally invariant\nversion of the general theory of relativity [9,21-24]. We have\nStot [w|F ] = SD [w|e, Q] + SSM [yhw|f, e],\n\n(1)\n\nwhere, for the action of the general relativity we take the Penrose-ChernikovTagirov action functional for a scalar field (dilaton) w,\nSD [w|e, Q] =\n\nZ\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f9\n\nR(e) \uf8f8\n+ w\u2202\u03bc (|e|\u2202 \u03bc ) w\uf8fb ,\nd4 x \uf8f0|e|w2 \uf8ed\u2202\u03bc Q\u2202 \u03bcQ \u2212\n6\n\n(2)\n\nin the space specified by the interval\nds2 = (e\u03bb\u03bc dx\u03bc )2 = (e0\u03bc dx\u03bc )2 \u2212 (ei\u03bc dx\u03bc )2 .\n\n(3)\n\nHere e\u03bb\u03bc is Fock's vierbein, R(e) is the curvature, and Q is an additional field\nthat does not interact with matter [11] and which yields the observed regime\nof cosmological evolution. In the Standard Model action functional featuring\nthe set of fields f , the Higgs mass MHiggs is replaced by the dilaton multiplied\nby a constant yh \u223c 10\u221217, (yh w). The theory specified by action functional (1)\n\nis invariant under conformal transformations, including scale transformations\nfor the set of all fields [w|F ] with the transformation parameter \u03a9,\n(n)\n\nF\u03a9 = (n) F \u00d7 (\u03a9)n,\n\nw\u03a9 =\n\nw\n,\n\u03a9\n\n(4)\n\nwhere (n) is a conformal weight. This invariance indicates that the action\nfunctional (1) involves an extra degree of freedom.\n3\n\n\f2.2. Absolute Variables\nIt is common practice to assume [24] that the action of general theory of\nrelativity and the Standard Model arises from the action functional (1) as a\nconsequence of choosing the \"absolute\" variables as\n(n)\n\nF(a) = (n) F \u00d7 (w/\u03c60)n , w(a) (x0, xi) = \u03c60,\n\n(5)\n\nwith the result that the dilaton w(x0, xi) is replaced the parameter \u03c60 that\nis related to the Planck mass by the equation \u03c60 = MPl (3/8\u03c0)1/2 and which\ndid not appear in the original action functional (1). Upon the spontaneous\nscale-invariance breaking associated with this, the symmetry of the action\nfunctional (1) under the transformations in (4) becomes the symmetry of\nthe physical variables in (5), which are invariant under the same scale transformations in (4). Owing to the above spontaneous breakdown of scale invariance, the extra degree of freedom characterized by a negative probability\nis removed from the action functional in (1), but, instead, the dimensional\n\"absolute\" Planck mass parameter MPl appears in the equations of motion.\nThis parameter specifies initial data concerning the emergence of the Universe in the so-called Planck era. In the theory involving such a spontaneous\nbreakdown of symmetry, the homogeneous approximation of the metric,\ne(a)0\u03bc dx\u03bc = dt,\n\ne(a)i\u03bc dx\u03bc = a(t)dxi,\n\n(6)\n\nfor variables in (5) leads to standard cosmological models including, the inflationary model [25], where the initial data of the Planck era are considered\nas the fundamental quantities of the equations of motion.\nWithin this approach, there arise problems of cosmological initial data,\nthe horizon, time and energy, homogeneity,singularity,and the quantum wave\nfunction for the Universe, and attempts are made to solve these problems at\nthe level of the homogeneous approximation via the inflationary expansion\nof absolute space [25].\n4\n\n\fIn [22, 23], some arguments are adduced that indicate that, in all probability, all these problems, including the emergence of the Planck era, stem\nfrom an incorrect formulation of a spontaneous breakdown of the symmetry of (5) in eliminating degrees of freedom of negative probability from the\ntheory specified by the action functional in (1)\nWe recall that, within a gauge theory, a formulation where all degrees of\nfreedom that are characterized by a negative probability are removed prior\nto quantizing the theory being considered is referred to as a \"fundamental\nmethod\" [26, 27, 28], in contrast to a \"heuristic method\" [29], where all\ndegrees of freedom are treated on equal footing. In [23], it was shown that,\nwithin relativistic string theory, these two methods lead to different spectra2).\nExperience gained in applying the fundamental-quantization method [26,\n27] to string models [23, 31] and to non-Abelian theories [28] shows that,\nupon a spontaneous breakdown of the gauge symmetry of the theory being\nconsidered, there arise Goldstone modes that are associated with this symmetry breaking and which cannot be removed by any gauge transformations\nwithout significantly changing the physical content of the theory, including\nthe spectrum of its elementary and collective excitations3).\nIn [9, 16, 21], a spontaneous breakdown of the scale invariance of the\ntheory being considered is formulated in terms of conformal variables, the\nGoldstone mode corresponding to this symmetry breaking being taken into\naccount.\n\n2)\n\n\"The heuristic formulation\" of a conformally invariant theory [30] leads to conformal anomalies, the\nVirasoro algebra and tachyons (particles for which the masses squared are negative), at the same time\neliminating extra degrees of freedom with a negative probability at the level of the classical theory [31] leads\nto the Born-Infeld model featuring a positive energy spectrum free from tachyons.\n3)\nIn the non-Abelian theory of strong interactions, the analogous Goldstone mode leads to an extra\ncontribution to the \u03b7 0 -meson mass, while averaging over the topological degeneracy of initial data may lead\nto zero probabilities of the production of color states of quarks and gluons [28].\n\n5\n\n\f2.3. Conformal Variables\nThe choice of \"relative\" (r) variables,\n(n)\n\nF(r) = (n) F \u00d7 (w/\u03c6(x0))n,\n\nw(r) (x0, xi) = \u03c6(x0),\n\n(7)\n\nleaves the dilaton zero mode as a homogeneous variable \u03c6(x0) with a constant\nvolume of three-dimensional hyperspace [11, 21], V(r) =\n\nR\n\nd3x|\u0113(r) | \u2261 const,\n\nin the reference frame specified by the embedding of a three-dimensional\nhyperspace into the four-dimensional manifold spanned by e00 = N , eij = \u0113ij ,\nei0 = Ni , where N and Ni are referred to the lapse function and the shift\nvector [32], respectively. In this reference frame, an variable \u03c6 plays the role\nof a cosmic scale factor and an evolution parameter in the world space of the\nfield variables [\u03c6|F ], while the canonical momentum defined as the derivative\nof the Lagrangian Ltot for the action functional (1) with respect to the time\nderivative of the dilaton field \u22020\u03c6,\nP\u03c6 =\n\nZ\n\u2202Ltot[\u03c6|e(r) ]\n|\u0113(r) |\nd\u03c6\n= \u22122\u22020\u03c6 d3 x\n\u2261 \u22122V(r) ,\n\u2202(\u22020\u03c6)\nN\nd\u03b7\n\n(8)\n\nis the localized energy of the Universe [23]; here, d\u03b7 = N0(x0)dx0 is the inR\n\nvariant integral for the averaged lapse function N0\u22121(x0) = d3 x|\u0113(r) |N \u22121 /V(r) ,\n\nwhile the bar over \u0113(r) , is, as we have seen above, denotes the spatial compoR\n\nnents of the vierbein for the constant volume V(r) = d3 x|\u0113(r) |.\n\nIn terms of the conformal variables in (7), the problems of the theory that\n\nare solved in terms of the absolute variables in (5) with the aid of inflation\nare solved within the exact theory by means of the zero mode of the dilaton\nas the evolution parameter. In particular, the evolution of \u03c6 with respect\nto the time interval explains the problem of the horizon as a consequence of\nsimultaneously varying particle masses and parameters of the system of fields\nover the entire space. The averaging of the exact equation \u03b4Stot /\u03b4N = 0 of\nthe theory for the lapse function N in terms of the variables in (7) over a\n6\n\n\fspecific spatial volume housing measured objects yields the equation of the\nevolution of the Universe\n\u03c6\u20322 = \u03c1,\n\n(9)\n\nR\n\nwhere \u03c1 = d3x|e|[T00 \u2212 \u03c62(R00 \u2212 R/2)], and T00 R00 being the components of\nthe Einstein energy-momentum and the Ricci tensor, respectively.\n\nWe note that, in the exact theory specified by the action functional in (1),\nEq. (9) is the analog of the Friedmann equation, which was derived in the\napproximation of homogeneity in the general theory of relativity. Thus, the\napproximation of a homogeneous universe coincides with the result obtained\nby averaging the exact equation \u03b4Stot /\u03b4N = 0 over the volume. Solving Eq.\n(9), we arrive at an analog of the Friedman relation between the conformal\n\u03c6\nR0\n\u221a\ntime and density, \u03b7(\u03c60, \u03c6I ) = \u00b1 d\u03c6/ \u03c1.\n\u03c6I\n\nWithin the Hamiltonian formalism, where the time derivatives of the fields\n\nare replaced by the corresponding canonical momenta P\u03c6 = \u22122V(r) \u03c6\u2032 , the\nequation of the Universe evolution (9), which describes the evolution of the\n\nUniverse, has the meaning of a Hamiltonian constraint, P\u03c62 /4V(r) = V(r) \u03c1. The\nHamiltonian V(r) \u03c1 as a generator of the conformal time evolution of fields can\nbe represented as the sum of the Hamiltonian for a uniform scalar field, V(r) \u03c1Q ,\nand the Hamiltonian for local field variables, Hfield : V(r) \u03c1 = V(r) \u03c1Q + Hfield ,\nwhere \u03c1Q is the density of the uniform scalar field.\nIn terms of the conformal variables in (7), the Planck mass as the \"absolute\" parameter of the equations of motion becomes a \"random\" current\nvalue of the field evolution parameter \u03c6(x0). Hence, in terms of the variables\nin (7) both the hypothesis of the Planck era and the problem of describing\nevolution from the Planck era 10\u221243c on the basis of the inflationary model\nof the Universe lose physical meaning4).\n4)\n\nThe variables in (5) arise from (7) upon the substitution (n) F(r) = (n) F(a) (\u03c6/\u03c60 )\u2212n . This transformation\nconverts the variable \u03c6 with initial cosmological data \u03c6(\u03b7 = 0) = \u03c6I , H(\u03b7 = 0) = HI into its current value\n\u03c6(\u03b7 = \u03b70 ) = \u03c60 , with the result that one of the ordinary\n(random) values of the variable \u03c6 becomes, for the\np\nequations of motion, the absolute parameter \u03c60 = 3/(8\u03c0)MPl , which is related to the Planck mass.\n\n7\n\n\fWithin the conformal variables (7), there arises the problem of studying\nthe quantum creation and evolution of a relativistic universe in the limit of\ninfinitely low masses (\u03c6(\u03b7) \u2192 0) and indefinitely high values of the Hub-\n\nble parameter (H(\u03b7) \u2192 \u221e). The variables in (5) and those in (7) provide\ntwo different cosmologies and two different formulations of the problem of\n\nstudying the origin of the Universe and matter.\n\n2.4. Conformal Cosmology\nIn the approximation of homogeneity, the conformal variables in (7) correspond to directly measured quantities of observational cosmology. We recall\nthat, in describing the cosmic evolution of the energy of photons emitted by\natoms in a cosmic object, use is made of the conformal interval of photons\n(dxi)2 = dt2 /a2 (t) = d\u03b7 2 propagating along the light cone, ds2 = 0, toward an\nobserver. The redshift of spectral lines, which is a directly measurable quantity in observational cosmology, depends on the \"conformal\" time \u03b7 = \u03b70 \u2212 r\n\nat the instant of photon emission by atoms of cosmic objects that occur at the\nq\n\n\"coordinate distance\" r = (xi)2 from the Earth. In terms of the conformal\ncoordinates, we find that the volume of the Universe does not increase, while\nall masses, including the Planck mass, are scaled by the cosmic factor a(\u03b7):\nm(r) (\u03b7) = m0 a(\u03b7),\n\nq\n\n[MPl 3/8\u03c0]a(\u03b7) = \u03c60a(\u03b7) = \u03c6(\u03b7).\n\n(10)\n\nIn terms of the conformal time, which is associated with the observed time,\nthe square-root regime of the evolution of the Universe in the era of primordial\nnucleosynthesis,\nq\n\na(t) = ae (\u03b7) = 1 + 2H0(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b70 ) = 1 \u2212 rH0 + O(r2 )\n\n(11)\n\nmeans that, in the era of chemical evolution, the Universe was filled with a\nfree uniform scalar field (see Eq. (15) below) rather than with radiation. The\n8\n\n\fevolution according to Eq. (11) is prescribed by a rigid equation of state such\nthat pressure coincides with the energy density.\nIn [16], it was shown that, in terms of the conformal variables, data on\nthe dependence of the redshift on the distance to supernovae [17] and data\non nucleosynthesis correspond to the same rigid equation of state associated\nwith Eq. (11).\nThe identification of the conformal variables in (7) with observable quantities leads to a different picture of the evolution of the Universe [11, 16, 21]\nin relation to the analogous identification of the variables in (5) as is done\nin conventional cosmology. The temperature history of a hot universe as\nrewritten in terms of the conformal variables in (7) appears as the evolution\nof elementary particle masses in a cold universe with a constant temperature of cosmic microwave background radiation. That the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation temperature TCMBR is independent of the redshift z\nis, at first glance, in glaring contradiction with the observation [33] that\n6.0 K < TCMBR (z = 2.3371) < 14 K. In this observation, the temperature was deduced from the relative population of various energy levels (their\nenergies being denoted by Ei), which follows from Boltzmann statistics. However, the argument of the Boltzmann factors, which is equal to the ratio of\nthe temperature to the mass, features the same dependence on the factor z\nin a cold universe as well [16]. Therefore, this ratio can be interpreted as the\nz dependence of energy levels (that is, mass) at a constant temperature. The\nabundances of chemical elements are determined primarily by Boltzmann factors as well, which are dependent on functions of the mass-to-temperature\nratio, which are invariant under conformal transformations [34].\n\n2.5. Initial Data of Quantum Cosmology\nAs a rule, quantum cosmology is defined as the homogeneous approxima9\n\n\ftion of the metric,\nds2(r) = [(d\u03b7)2 \u2212 (dxi)2],\n\nd\u03b7 = N0 (x0)dx0,\n\n(12)\n\nwith the shift function N0 (x0) inheriting the symmetry group of the general\ntheory of relativity in the form of invariance under reparametrizations of\nthe coordinate time, x0 \u2192 xe 0 = xe 0(x0). Cosmological models featuring this\n\nsymmetry group, which were first described at a mathematically rigorous\nlevel by DeWitt, Wheeler, and Misner [35, 36] in the late 1960s, do not differ\nin any respect from the relativistic mechanics of a particle in the special\ntheory of relativity. There is a direct correspondence between the Minkowski\nspace of variables in the special theory of relativity and the space of field\nvariables in the theory being considered, where the dilaton field \u03c6 plays the\n\nrole of the time-like variable of Minkowski space.\nIn the particular case where the uniform scalar field Q(\u03b7) is dominant, we\narrive at a simple cosmological model of the Universe [11]; that is,\nSuniv = V(r)\n=\n\nZ (\n\nwhere PQ\n\nZ\n\n\uf8ee\n\nd\u03c6\ndx0 \uf8f0\n\u2212\nN0\ndx0\n\n!2\n\n+ \u03c62\n\ndQ\ndx0\n\n!2 \uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\n=\n\n(13)\n)\n\ni\nh\nd\u03c6\ndQ\n\u2212P\u03c6 0 + PQ 0 + N0V(r) (P\u03c6 /2V(r) )2 \u2212 (PQ /2\u03c6V(r) )2 ,\ndx\ndx\n= 2V(r) \u03c62 Q\u2032 , P\u03c6 = 2V(r) \u03c6\u2032 are canonical momenta. A variation\n\nof the action functional with respect to the shift function N (x0) leads to a\nconstraint equation for these two momenta,\nP\u03c62 \u2212 PQ2 /\u03c62 = 0\n\n\u21d2\n\nP\u03c6 = \u00b1PQ /\u03c6,\n\n(14)\n\n\u03c62 = \u03c62I (1 + 2HI \u03b7),\n\n(15)\n\nits solution being\nPQ = 2V(r) HI \u03c62I = const,\n\nwhere \u03c62I HI = PQ /2V(r) is an integral of the motion. As was shown in [16],\nthe resulting evolution law (15) for the scale factor is compatible with the\nevolution of supernovae in terms of conformal variables [17].\n10\n\n\fUpon the quantization of the theory specified by the action functional\n(13), the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the wave function \u03a8,\n\u0014\n\nP\u0302\u03c62\n\n\u2212\n\nP\u0302Q2 /\u03c62\n\n\u0015\n\n\u03a8=0\n\narises as the direct analogy of the Klein\u2013Gordon equation in the quantum\ngeneral theory of relativity. Like that solution to the Klein-Gordon equation\nfor a relativistic particle which describes the creation and annihilation of\npositive-energy particles, the solution\n+\n{iPQ (Q\u2212QI )}\n\u03a8 = A+\n\u03b8(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6I )+\nP\u03c6 \u22650 \u03a8 [PQ |\u03c6]e\n\u2212\n{\u2212iPQ (Q\u2212QI )}\n\u03b8(\u2212\u03c6)\nA\u2212\nP\u03c6 \u22640 \u03a8 [PQ |\u03c6]e\n\nto the Wheeler-DeWitt equation depends on the initial data QI and \u03c6I . In\norder to get rid of negative energies and to create a stable quantum system,\na causal quantization is postulated in quantum field theory in such a way\nthat positive-energy excitations move in the forward direction along the time\naxis, while negative-energy excitations move in the backward direction with\nrespect to time. The analogous interpretation of the coefficient A+ as the\ncreation operator for the Universe, and the coefficient A\u2212 as the annihilation\noperator for the anti-Universe solves the problem of a cosmic singularity of the\nUniverse at positive \"energy\", since, for positive energies, the wave function\ndoes not involve the singularity point \u03c6 = 0; this singularity appears in the\nnegative-\"energy\" wave function, which is treated as the amplitude of the\nprobability for the annihilation of the anti-Universe.\nThe quantum general theory of relativity loses the geometric interval of\ntime and information about how the metric depends on the time interval-in\nparticular, it loses the Hubble law describing the dependence of the scale on\nthe time interval [see Eqs. (15)]. In [22], it was proposed to make a canonical\ntransformation (known as the Levi-Civita transformation) from the original\nvariables to a new world space of variables. In terms of these variables, the\n11\n\n\fcosmic scale (dilaton) becomes a geometric interval of time with cosmic initial\ndata \u03c6(\u03b7 = 0) = \u03c6I , H(\u03b7 = 0) = HI in (15), which are random values of\nvariables fitted to experimental data.\nIn this case, the conformal variables in (7) naturally lead to the concept\nof particles [9], which has been used and is being presently used in almost all\nof the studies devoted to the cosmological creation of particles [7].\n\n2.6. Definition of a Particle in Quantum Field Theory\nIn quantum field theory, the concept of a particle can be associated only\nwith those field variables that are characterized by a positive probability and\na positive energy. Negative energies are removed by causal quantization,\naccording to which the creation operator at a negative energy is replaced by\nthe annihilation operator at the respective positive energy. All of the variables\nthat are characterized by a negative probability can be removed according to\nthe scheme of fundamental operator quantization [26]. The results obtained\nby applying the operator-quantization procedure to massive vector fields in\nthe case of the conformal flat metric (12) are given in [9, 11, 13].\nIn order to determine the evolution law for all fields v, it is convenient to\nuse the Hamiltonian form of the action functional for their Fourier compoR\n\nnents vkI = d3xe\u0131k*x vI (x); that is,\nStot =\n\n0\nZx2\n\nx01\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2X \u0014\n\ndx0 \uf8f3\n||\n\nk\n\n||\n\n||\n\n\u22a5\np\u22a5\nk \u22020 vk + pk \u22020 vk\n\n\u0015\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\uf8fc\n\n\uf8fd\nPa2\n\uf8fb ,(16)\n\u2212\nV\n\u03c1\n\u2212 Pa \u22020 a + N0 \uf8f0\n(r) tot \uf8fe\n4V(r) \u03c620\n\nwhere p\u22a5\nk , pk are the canonical momenta for, respectively, the transverse and\n\nthe longitudinal component of vector bosons and \u03c1tot is the sum of the conformal densities of the scalar field obeying the rigid equation of state and the\nvector field,\n\u03c620 H02\n\u03c1tot (a) =\n+ \u03c1v (a),\na2\n12\n\n(17)\n\n\f\u22121\n\u03c1v (a) = V(r)\n(H \u22a5 + H || ),\n\n(18)\n\nH \u22a5 H || being the Hamiltonians for a free field,5)\nP 1 h \u22a52\n2 pk +\nk\n\"\u0012\n\u00132\nP1\n||\n\u03c9(a,k)\npk 2\n2\nMv a\nk\n\nH\u22a5 =\nH || =\n\ni\n\n\u03c9 2 vk\u22a52 ,\n||\n\n(19)\n\n#\n\n+ (Mv a)2 vk 2 .\n\nHere, the dispersion relation has the form \u03c9(a, k) =\n\nq\n\nk2 + (Mv a)2 ; for the\n\n||\n\n||\n\n||\n\nsake of brevity, we have also introduced the notation pk 2 \u2261 pk * p\u2212k .\n\nWithin the reparametrization-invariant models specified by action func-\n\ntionals of the type in (16) with the Hamiltonians in (19), the concepts of an\nobservable particle and of cosmological particle creation were defined in [9].\nWe will illustrate these definitions by considering the example of an oscillator\nwith a variable energy. Specifically, we take its Lagrangian in the form\n1\nL = pv \u22020v \u2212 N0 [p2v + \u03c9 2 v2 \u2212 \u03c9] + \u03c10 (N0 \u2212 1) .\n2\n\n(20)\n\nThe quantity Hv = [p2v + \u03c9 2 v2]/2 has the meaning of a \"conformal Hamiltonian\" as a generator of the evolution of the fields v and pv with respect to\nthe conformal-time interval d\u03b7 = N0dx0, where the shift function N0 plays\nthe role of a Lagrange multiplier. The equation for N0 introduces the density\n\u03c10 = Hv \u2212 \u03c9/2 in accordance with its definition adopted in the general theory\nof relativity.

Therefore, such a formulation, which depends on the reference frame used, does not\ncontradict the general theory of irreducible and unitary transformations of the relativistic group [37].\n\n13\n\n\fwith the aid of the transition to the symmetric variables p and q defined as\npv =\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03c9p = i\n\ns\n\n\u03c9 +\n(a \u2212 a),\n2\n\nv=\n\nv\nu\nu1\nt\n\n\u03c9\n\nq=\n\nv\nu\nu\nt\n\n1 +\n(a + a).\n2\u03c9\n\n(23)\n\nIn terms of the symmetric variables p, q the particle-number operator takes\nform\n\n1\n1\n(24)\nN\u0302part = [p2 + q 2 ] \u2212 = a+ a.\n2\n2\nUpon going over to these variables in the Lagrangian in (20), we arrive at\nL = p\u22020 q \u2212 pq\u22020\u2206\u22a5 \u2212 N0\u03c9[N\u0302part + 1/2] ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u22020 \u2206\u22a5 = \u22020 \u03c9/2\u03c9 and where there appears sources of cosmic particle\ncreation in the form pq = i[(a+)2 \u2212 a2 ]/2.

A slow decrease\nin the longitudinal component as a function of momentum leads to a divergence of the integral for the density of product particles [2]:\ni\n1 Z\u221e 2 h ||\nnv (\u03b7) = 2 dqq N (q, \u03b7) + 2N \u22a5(q, \u03b7) \u2192 \u221e.\n2\u03c0 0\n\n(40)\n\n3.2.

In this case, it is well known [38], that one deals with the\nproduction not a pair but a set of Bose \u2013 particles, which acquires, owing\nto the aforementioned interactions, the properties of a statistical system. As\na model of such a statistical system, we consider here a degenerate BoseEinstein gas, whose distribution function has the form (we use the system of\nunits where the Boltzmann constant is kB = 1)\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fc\u22121\n\n\uf8fd\n\u03c9v (\u03b7) \u2212 Mv (\u03b7) \uf8fb\nF (Tv , q, Mv (\u03b7), \u03b7) = \uf8f3exp \uf8f0\n\u2212 1\uf8fe\nTv\n\n,\n\n(41)\n\nwhere Tv is the boson temperature. We set apart the problem of theoretically\nvalidating such a statistical system and its thermodynamic exchange, only\nassuming fulfillment of specific conditions ensuring its existence. In particular, we can introduce the notion of the temperature Tv only in an equilibrium\nsystem. A thermal equilibrium is thought to be stable if the time within\nwhich the vector-boson temperature Tv is established, that is, the relaxation\n\n18\n\n\ftime [39]\n\u03b7rel = [n(Tv )\u03c3scat ]\u22121\n\n(42)\n\n(expressed in terms of their density n(Tv ) and the scattering cross section\n\u03c3scat. \u223c 1/MI2 ), does not exceed the time of vector-boson-density formation\nowing to cosmological creation, the latter time being controlled by the pri-\n\nmordial Hubble parameter \u03b7v = 1/HI . From formula (42) it follows, that the\nparticle-number density is proportional to the product of the Hubble parameter and the mass squared, that is an integral of the motion in the present\nexample:\nn(Tv ) = n(Tv , \u03b7v ) \u2243 CH HI MI2 ,\n\n(43)\n\nwhere CH is a constant. The expression for the density n(Tv , \u03b7) in Eq. (43)\nassumes the form\nh\ni\n1 Z\u221e 2\nnv (Tv , \u03b7) = 2 dqq F (Tv , q, M(\u03b7), \u03b7) N || (q, \u03b7) + 2N \u22a5(q, \u03b7) .\n2\u03c0 0\n\n(44)\n\nHere, the probability of the production of a longitudinal and a transverse boson with a specific momentum in an ensemble featuring exchange interaction\nis given (in accordance with the multiplication law for probabilities) by the\nproduct of two probabilities, the probability of their cosmological creation,\nN ||,\u22a5 and the probability of a single-particle state of vector bosons obeying\nthe Bose-Einstein distribution (41).\n\nA dominant contribution to the integral (44) from the region of high momenta (in the above idealized analysis disregarding the Boltzmann factor,\nthis resulted in a divergence) implies the relativistic temperature dependence\nof the density,\nn(Tv , \u03b7v ) = CT Tv3,\n\n(45)\n\nwhere CT is a coefficient. A numerical calculation of the integral (44) for the\nvalues Tv = MI = HI , which follow from the assumption about the choice of\ninitial data (CT = CH ), reveals that this integral (44) is weakly dependent on\n19\n\n\ftime in the region \u03b7 \u2265 \u03b7v = HI\u22121 and, for the constant CT , yields the value\no\nnv\n1 n\n(46)\nCT = 3 = 2 [1, 877]|| + 2[0, 277]\u22a5 = 2, 431 ,\nTv\n2\u03c0\nwhere the contributions of longitudinal and transverse bosons are labeled\nwith the superscripts (||, \u22a5), respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, the lifetime \u03b7L of product bosons in the early Universe\n\nin dimensionless units \u03c4L = \u03b7L /\u03b7I , where \u03b7I = (2HI )\u22121, can be estimated\nby using the equation of state a2 (\u03b7) = a2I (1 + \u03c4L) and the W -boson lifetime\nwithin the Standard Model. Specifically, we have\n2HI sin2 \u03b8(W )\n2 sin2 \u03b8(W )\n\u221a\n1 + \u03c4L =\n=\n,\n\u03b1QED MW (\u03b7L) \u03b1QED \u03b3v 1 + \u03c4L\n\n(47)\n\nwhere \u03b8(W ) is the Weinberg angle, \u03b1QED = 1/137 is the fine-structure constant, and \u03b3v = MI /HI \u2265 1.\n\nFrom the solution to Eq. (47),\n\uf8f62/3\n\n\uf8eb\n\n2\n2\nsin\n\u03b8(W ) \uf8f8\n\u03c4L + 1 = \uf8ed\n\u03b3v \u03b1QED\n\n\u2243\n\n16\n2/3\n\u03b3v\n\n(48)\n\nit follows that, at \u03b3v = 1, the lifetime of product bosons is an order of\nmagnitude longer than the Universe relaxation time:\n\u03b7L\n16\n\u2243 2/3 \u2212 1 = 15.\n\u03c4L =\n\u03b7I\n\u03b3v\n\n(49)\n\nTherefore, we can introduce the notion of the vector-boson temperature\nTv , which is inherited by the final vector boson decay products (photons).\nAccording to currently prevalent concepts, these photons form cosmic microwave background radiation in the Universe. Indeed, suppose that one\nphoton comes from the annihilation of the products of W \u00b1 -boson decay and\nthat the other comes from Z-bosons. In view of the fact that the volume\nof the Universe is constant within the evolution model being considered, it\nis then natural to expect that the photon density coincides with the boson\ndensity [11]\nn\u03b3 = T\u03b33\n\n1\n{2.404} \u2243 nv .\n\u03c02\n20\n\n(50)\n\n\fOn the basis of (43), (45), (46) and (50) we can estimate the temperature\nT\u03b3 of cosmic microwave background radiation arising upon the annihilation\nand decay of W + and Z-bosons:\n\"\n\n2.431\nT\u03b3 \u2243\n2.404 * 2\n\n#1/3\n\nTv = 0.8Tv,\n\n(51)\n\ntaking into account that the temperature of vector-bosons Tv = [HI MI2 ]1/3 is\nan invariant quantity in the described model. This invariant can be estimated\nat\n2 1/3\nTv = [HI MI2 ]1/3 = [H0MW\n] = 2.73/0.8K = 3.41K\n\n(52)\n\nwhich is a value that is astonishingly close to the observed temperature of\ncosmic microwave background radiation. In the present case, this directly\nfollows, as is seen from the above analysis of our numerical calculations, from\nthe dominance of longitudinal vector bosons with high momenta and from\nthe fact that the relaxation time is equal to the inverse Hubble parameter.\nThe inclusion of physical processes, like the heating of photons owing to\nelectron-positron annihilation e+ e\u2212 [40] amounts to multiplying the photon\ntemperature (51) by (11/4)1/3 = 1.4 therefore, we have\nT\u03b3 (e+ e\u2212 ) \u2243 (11/4)1/30.8Tv = 2.77 K .\n\n(53)\n\nWe note that, in other models [41], the fluctuations of the product-particle\ndensity are related to primary fluctuations of cosmic microwave background\nradiation [42].\n\n3.3. Inverse Effect of Product Particles on the Evolution of the Universe\nThe equation of motion \u03c6\u20322 (\u03b7) = \u03c1tot (\u03b7), with the Hubble parameter defined as H = \u03c6\u2032 /\u03c6, means that, at any instant of time, the energy density in\nthe Universe is equal to the so-called critical density; that is\n\u03c1tot (\u03b7) = H 2 (\u03b7)\u03c62(\u03b7) \u2261 \u03c1cr (\u03b7) .\n21\n\n\fThe dominance of matter obeying the extremely rigid equation of state implies the existence of an approximate integral of the motion in the form\nH(\u03b7)\u03c62(\u03b7) = H0\u03c620 .\nOn this basis, we can immediately find the ratio of the product-vectorboson energy, \u03c1v (\u03b7I ) \u223c T 4 \u223c HI4 \u223c MI4 , to the density of the Universe in the\nextremely rigid state, \u03c1tot (\u03b7I ) = HI2 \u03c62I ,\n\nM2\nM2\n\u03c1v (\u03b7I )\n2\n\u221234\n= 2I = W\n.\n2 = yv = 10\n\u03c1tot (\u03b7I )\n\u03c6I\n\u03c60\n\n(54)\n\nThis value indicates that the inverse effect of product particles on the evolution of the Universe is negligible.\nThe primordial mesons before their decays polarize the Dirac fermion vacuum and give the baryon asymmetry frozen by the CP \u2013 violation, so that\nnb /n\u03b3 \u223c XCP \u223c 10\u22129 and \u03a9b \u223c \u03b1qed / sin2 \u03b8(W) \u223c 0.03.\n3.4. Baryon-antibaryon Asymmetry of Matter in the Universe\nIn each of the three generations of leptons (,\u03bc,\u03c4 ) and color quarks, we\nhave four fermion doublets-in all, there are nL = 12 of them. Each of\n12 fermion doublets interacts with the triplet of non-Abelian fields A1 =\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(W (\u2212) + W (+) )/ 2, A2 = i(W (\u2212) \u2212 W (+) )/ 2, and A3 = Z/ cos \u03b8(W ) , the\ncorresponding coupling constant being g = e/ sin \u03b8(W ) .\n\nIt is well known that, because of a triangle anomaly, W- and Z- boson\n(i)\n\ninteraction with lefthanded fermion doublets \u03c8L , i = 1, 2, ..., nL, leads to a\nnonconservation of the number of fermions of each type (i) [43, 44],\n(i)\n\n\u2202\u03bc jL\u03bc =\n\n1\nTrF\u0302\u03bc\u03bd \u2217F\u0302\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n32\u03c0\n\n(55)\n\na\na\nwhere F\u0302\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212iF\u03bc\u03bd\ngW \u03c4a /2 is the strength of the vector fields, F\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bd \u2212\n\n\u2202\u03bd Aa\u03bc + g\u01ebabc Ab\u03bc Ac\u03bd .\n\n22\n\n\fTaking the integral of the equality in (55) with respect to the four-dimensional\nvariable x, we can find a relation between the change \u2206F (i) =\nthe fermion number F (i) =\nNCS =\n\n1 R\n32\u03c0 2\n\nd4xTrF\u0302\u03bc\u03bd \u2217F\u0302\u03bc\u03bd :\n\nR\n\n(i)\n\nR\n\n(i)\n\nd4 x\u2202\u03bcjL\u03bc\n\nd3xj0 and the Chern-Simons functional [19],\n\n\u2206F (i) = NCS 6= 0,\n\ni = 1, 2, ..., nL.\n\n(56)\n\nThe equality in (56) is considered as a selection rule \u2013 that is, the fermion\nnumber changes identically for all fermion types: NCS = \u2206Le = \u2206L\u03bc =\n\u2206L\u03c4 = \u2206B/3; at the same time, the change in the baryon charge B and the\nchange in the lepton charge L = Le +L\u03bc +L\u03c4 are related to each other in such\na way that B \u2212 L is conserved, while B + L is not invariant. Upon taking the\n\nsum of the equalities in (56) over all doublets, we obtain \u2206(B + L) = 12NCS .\n\nWe can evaluate the expectation value of the Chern-Simons functional\n(56) (in the lowest order of perturbation theory in the coupling constant) in\nthe Bogolyubov vacuum b|0 >sq = 0.

Upon a\nnumerical calculation of this integral, we can estimate the expectation value\nof the Chern-Simons functional in the state of primordial bosons.\nPrimordial fluctuation of the baryon number\nR\n\nR\u03b7\n\ndkk 2 [4 cos2 \u03b8(W ) RW + RZ ]\n\nnb (\u03b7)\n0\n.\n=R\n\u03b7Rw\n\u03b7Rz\nnb (\u03b7L)\n2\n2\ndkk [4 cos \u03b8(W ) d\u03b7RW + d\u03b7RZ]\n0\n\n(59)\n\n0\n\nAt the vector-boson-lifetime values of \u03c4LW = 15, \u03c4LZ = 30, this yields the\nfollowing result at n\u03b3 \u2243 nv\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(NW + NZ )\n\u03b1QED 3 \uf8ed\nNCS\n2.41 \uf8f8\n=\n=\nT 4 \u00d7 1.44 +\n= 1.2 n\u03b3 .\n2\nV(r)\nV(r)\nsin \u03b8(W )\ncos2 \u03b8(W )\n\n(60)\n\nOn this basis, the violation of the fermion-number densityin the cosmological\nmodel being considered can be estimated as [16]\nNCS\n\u2206F (i)\n=\n= 1.2n\u03b3 ,\nV(r)\nV(r)\n\n(61)\n\nwhere n\u03b3 = 2, 402 \u00d7 T 3 /\u03c0 2 is the number density of photons forming cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation.\n\nAccording to Sakharov [18] this violation of the fermion number is frozen\nby CP nonconservation, this leading to the baryon-number density\n\u2206F (i)\n\u2243 XCP n\u03b3 .\nnb = XCP\nV(r)\n\n(62)\n\nwhere the factor XCP is determined by the superweak interaction of d and\ns quarks, which is responsible for CP violation experimentally observed in\nK-meson decays [45] (see Fig. 2).\nFrom the ratio of the number of baryons to the number of photons, one can\ndeduce an estimate of the superweak-interaction coupling constant: XCP \u223c\n\n10\u22129. Thus, the evolution of the Universe, primary vector bosons, and the\naforementioned superweak interaction [45] (it is responsible for CP violation\n24\n\n\fand is characterized by a coupling-constant value of XCP \u223c 10\u22129) lead to\n\nbaryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the Universe, the respective baryon density\nbeing\n\u03c1b (\u03b7 = \u03b7L) \u2243 10\u22129 \u00d7 10\u221234\u03c1cr (\u03b7 = \u03b7L).\n\n(63)\n\nIn order to assess the further evolution of the baryon density, one can take\nhere the W-boson lifetime for \u03b7L .\nUpon the decay of the vector bosons in question, their temperature is inherited by cosmic microwave background radiation. The subsequent evolution\nof matter in a stationary cold universe is an exact replica of the well-known\nscenario of a hot universe [34], since this evolution is governed by conformally\ninvariant mass-to-temperature ratios m/T .\nFormulas (47), (54), and (63) make it possible to assess the ratio of the\npresent-day values of the baryon density and the density of the scalar field,\nwhich plays the role of primordial conformal quintessence in the model being\nconsidered. We have\n\"\n\n\u03c60\n\u03c1b (\u03b70)\n=\n\u03a9b(\u03b70) =\n\u03c1cr (\u03b70)\n\u03c6L\n\n#3\n\n\"\n\n\u03c60\n=\n\u03c6I\n\n#3 \"\n#\n\u03c6I 3\n\n\u03c6L\n\n,\n\n(64)\n\nwhere we have considered that the baryon density increases in proportion to\nthe mass and that the density of the primordial quintessence decreases in\ninverse proportion to the mass squared. We recall that the ratio [\u03c60/\u03c6I ]3 is\napproximately equal to 1043 and that the ratio [\u03c6I /\u03c6L]3 is determined by the\n\u221a\nboson lifetime in (48) and by the equation of state \u03c6(\u03b7) \u223c \u03b7.

CONCLUSION\nWithin the conformal formulation of the general theory of relativity and\nthe Standard Model, we have investigated conditions under which the origin\nof matter can be explained by its cosmological creation from a vacuum. We\nhave presented some arguments in support of the statement that the number\nof product vector-boson pairs is sufficient for explaining the total amount of\nobserved matter and its content, provided that the Universe is considered as\na conventional physical object that is characterized by a finite volume and a\nfinite lifetime and which is described by a conformally invariant version of the\ngeneral theory of relativity and the Standard Model featuring scale-invariant\nequations where all masses, including the Planck mass, are replaced by the\ndilaton variable and where the spatial volume is replaced by a constant.\nIn this case, the energy of the entire Universe in the field space of events is\ndescribed by analogy with the description of the energy of a relativistic quantum particle in Minkowski space: one of the variables (dilaton in the case\nbeing considered) becomes an evolution parameter, while the corresponding\n26\n\n\fcanonically conjugate momentum assumes the role of energy [22, 23]. This\nmeans that measured quantities are identified with conformal variables that\nare used in observational cosmology and in quantum field theory in calculating cosmological particle creation from a vacuum [6, 7, 9, 22]. Within the\nerrors of observation, this identification of conformal variables with observables is compatible with data on the chemical evolution of matter and data\non supernovae, provided that cosmic evolution proceeds via the regime dominated by the density of a free scalar field Q [11, 16]. Thus, the identification\nof conformal coordinates and variables used in observational cosmology and\nin quantum field theory with measured quantities is a first condition under\nwhich the origin of matter can be explained by its cosmological creation from\na vacuum. This is possible within a conformally invariant unified theory,\nwhere the Planck mass, which is an absolute quantity in the general theory\nof relativity, becomes an ordinary present-day value of the dilaton and where\nthe Planck era loses its absolute meaning.\nThe construction of a stable vacuum of perturbation theory by eliminating (through the choice of gauge-invariant variables) unphysical fields whose\nquantization leads to a negative normalization of the wave function in this\nreference frame is a second condition.\nFinally, the elimination of divergences in summing the probabilities of\nproduct particles over their momenta by thermalizing these particles in the\nregion where the Boltzmann H-theorem is applicable is a third condition.\nUnder these conditions, it has been found in the present study that, in\ndescribing the creation of vector bosons from a vacuum in terms of confor2\nmal variables, one arrives at the temperature (MW\nH0)1/3 \u223c 2.7K, of cosmic\n\nmicrowave background radiation as an integral of the motion of the Uni-\n\nverse and at the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the Universe with the\nsuperweak-interaction coupling constant XCP =\n\n27\n\nnb\nn\u03b3\n\nand the baryon density\n\n\f\u03a9b =\n\n\u03b1QED\nsin2 \u03b8(W )\n\n\u223c 0.03, these results being in satisfactory agreement with the\n\ncorresponding observed values and being compatible with the most recent\ndata on supernovae and nucleosynthesis.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to B.A. Arbuzov, B.M.
