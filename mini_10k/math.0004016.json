The notion of Paris options is extended\nsuch that their valuation is possible at any point during their lifespan. The\nLaplace transforms of [CJY] are modified when necessary, and their basic\nanalytic properties are discussed.\n\n1. Introduction: This paper is the first part of a report on the valuation of the Paris\nform of barrier options proposed in [CJY]. In their standard form European\u2013style barrier\noptions come as puts or calls that are activated or deactivated as soon as their underlying\nhits a prespecified barrier level. The new idea of the Paris barrier options for cushioning\nthis abruptness is to introduce a systematic delay for these consequences of hitting the\nbarrier to become effective.\nTo fix ideas consider the Paris down\u2013and\u2013in call option. Suppose the underlying is moving\ndownwards and hits the barrier level. This Paris option is then not immediately activated.\nInstead, a clock starts ticking at the very moment the underlying passes below the barrier\nlevel. It will tick for D consecutive periods in time. Only then, with this delay of D\nperiods the option will be activated if the following two conditions hold. First, one is still\nduring the life span of the option. Second, during any of these last D periods of time the\nunderlying has been staying below the barrier level. To further illustrate this Paris option,\nsuppose D periods before its maturity the option is not yet activated and no clock has\nstarted ticking. Then the option will not be activated during its life time. It is already\nworthless.\nThis paper addresses foundational questions in valuating Paris options. For instance, a\nprincipal difficulty had been pointed out to the author by Pliska. Suppose the clock is\nalready ticking for a Paris option, how should one valuate this option? The necessary\nextensions of [CJY] are discussed in Part I. For valuating Paris options the Laplace transform approach is adopted. Indeed, Laplace transforms of their prices have been computed\nin [CJY], and the discussion of Part II is based on their results. However, pursuing Pliska's\nsuggestions we found it necessary to modify one of these two Laplace transforms. So I am\nvery grateful to Pliska for his remark. In this conncetion I also wish to thank Yor for\nmaking available to me corrections to [CJY] collected by Jeanblanc\u2013Picqu\u00e9.\nThis status quo ante set by [CJY] is extended in Part III where a number of insights into\nthe analytical structure of the above Laplace transforms are discussed. More precisely,\nthese Laplace transforms are constructed using a function \u03a8 whose analytical properties\nare analyzed. In particular the series of this function is derived and also an asymptotic\nexpansion for it is proved that is uniform on the right\u2013half plane. These results are\nfundamental for the Laplace inversion of the above Laplace transforms.\nRecall that the Laplace transform generally consists of two stages. As a first step, a suit1\n\n\f2\n\nMichael Schr\u00f6der\n\nably nice function on the positive real line is transformed into a complex\u2013valued function.\nThis Laplace transform exists on a half\u2013plane sufficiently deep within the right complex\nhalf\u2013plane and defines there a holomorphic, i.e., complex analytic, function. As a second\nstep, the Laplace transform has to be inverted to give the desired function on the positive\nreal line. The natural methods in this step are complex analytic. Relevant concepts for\nthe endeavours ahead are recalled in Part 0.\nTo proceed, recall how for valuating barrier options the relative position of strike price\nand barrier play a role. For Paris options this list has to be extended and we propose the\nfollowing notions. If the barrier is equal to or below the strike price we have a standard\nsituation, otherwise we have a perverse situation. Also the relative position of today's price\nof the underlying to the barrier level matters. We have the first situation if today's price\nof the underlying is equal to or above the barrier level. If today's price of the underlying\nis below the barrier level, so that the clock for Paris option has started ticking, we have\nthe second situation. These situations combine into four possible cases. In each of these\ncases there is a different Laplace transform to be inverted.\nWith this program in mind the reader now may wish not only to take a look at this paper\nbut also at its companion [SP]. The focus of this last paper is on Laplace inversion. It\naddresses valuating the Paris options in the above first standard case. However, its results\nabout Laplace inversion are typical and fundamental for the remaining three cases.\nAcknowlegements: In addition to Professors Pliska and Yor already mentioned in the introduction, I would like to thank in Mannheim Professor R. Weissauer, Dr. U. Weselmann, and\nDr. D. Fulea for their interest in and support of this project.\n\nPart 0\n\nEpitome of methods\n\n2. Certain classes of higher transcendental functions: This paragraph recalls\npertinent facts about the the gamma function and the error function from [L], [D].\nGamma function: The gamma function \u0393 is defined on the right complex half\u2013plane\nby the improper integral:\nZ \u221e\ne\u2212t tz\u22121 dt ,\n\u0393(z) =\n0\n\nfor any complex number z with positive real part. It interpolates the factorial in the sense\nthat \u0393(n +1) = n!, for any non\u2013negative integer n, and more generally satisfies the recursion rule \u0393(z+1) = z\u0393(z). The functional equation \u0393(z) * \u0393(1\u2212z) * sin(\u03c0z) = \u03c0 in particular\nshows how it continues to a meromorphic function on the whole complex plane with simple\npoles in the non\u2013positive\n\u221a integers as its singularities. It satisfies the duplication formula\n22z\u22121 \u0393(z)\u0393(z+1/2) = \u03c0 \u0393(2z).\nForR any complex numbers a, z with positive real part, one has the identity: \u0393(z) =\n\u221e\naz 0 e\u2212at tz\u22121 dt. Indeed, for a real it is obtained by a change of variable. Applying the\nidentity theorem the resulting identity is then valid on the whole right half\u2013plane.\n\n\f3\n\nValuation of Paris options\n\nUnlike the gamma function itself, its reciprocal is holomorphic on the whole complex plane.\nA repesentation as a contour integral is given by the Hankel formula:\nZ\n1\nxa\u22121\nexw w\u2212a dw ,\n=\n\u0393(a)\n2\u03c0i C\nthat is valid for any complex number x with positive real part, and now for any complex\nnumber a. Herein C is any of the Hankel contours C\u03b5,R with 0 < \u03b5 < R, or their limits for\n\u03b5 converging to zero, defined as the following paths of integration: enter from minus infinity\nO\nfb\na\nec\nd\u2022\n\u2022\n\no\n\u2022\n\n/\n\ni\u03b5\n\n\u2212R\n\nR\n\n/\n\nFigure A The Hankel contour C\u03b5,R\n\non a parallel to the real axis through \u2212i\u03b5 until circle in the orgin with radius R is first hit.\nPass counterclockwise on this circle until the parallel to the real axis through +i\u03b5 is hit in\nthe left complex half\u2013plane. Leave on this parallel to minus infinity.\nError function: The complementary error function Erfc is the analytic function on the\ncomplex plane given by:\nZ \u221e\n2\n\u2212w 2\nErfc (z) = \u221a\ne\ndw ,\n\u03c0 z\nfor any complex number z, where the path of integration in the last integral starts at z\nand moves parallel to the real axis with the real part of its elements going to infinity.\n3. Laplace transform: This paragraph collects pertinent facts about the Laplace\ntransform from [D].\nThe class of functions considered in the sequel is that of functions of exponential type, i.e.,\nof continuous, real\u2013valued functions f on the non\u2013negative real line such that there is a real\nnumber a for which exp (at)f (t) is bounded for any t > 0. The Laplace transform is the\nlinear operator L that associates to any function f of exponential type the complex\u2013valued\nfunction L(f ), analytic on a suitable complex half\u2013plane, given by:\nZ \u221e\nL(f )(z) =\ne\u2212zt f (t) dt ,\n0\n\nfor any complex number z with sufficiently big real part. The convergence theorem is\nthat the Laplace transform L(f ) converges on the whole half plane {z|Re (z) \u2265 Re (z0 )}\nif L(f )(z0 ) exists. So there is a unique \u2212\u221e \u2264 \u03c3 = \u03c3f \u2264 \u221e, the abscissa of convergence\nof L(f ), such that L(f )(z) converges, for any z with Re (z) > \u03c3 and does not exist for z\nwith Re (z) < \u03c3. To fix ideas, consider the function\nR \u221e given by f (t) = exp (at) with a any\npositive real number so that formally L(f )(z) = 0 exp (\u2212(z\u2212a)t) dt. With the absolute\n\n\f4\n\nMichael Schr\u00f6der\n\nvalue of exp (w) being equal to exp (Re (w)), for any complex number w, this improper\nintegral exists iff the real part of z \u2212a is positive, i.e., iff the real part of z is bigger than\na. In this case, L(f )(z) equals (z\u2212a)\u22121 and is analytic on the half plane {z|Re (z) > a}.\nThat L is an injection is a consequence of ultimately the Weierstrass approximation theorem. Its inverse, the inverse Laplace transform L\u22121 , is expressed as a contour integral by\nthe complex inversion formula of Riemann. For any function H analytic on half\u2013planes\n{Re (z) \u2265 x0 } with x0 any sufficiently big positive real number, it asserts:\nL\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n(H)(t) =\n2\u03c0i\n\nZ\n\nx0 +i\u221e\n\nx0 \u2212i\u221e\n\nezt * H(z) dz,\n\nfor any positive real number t if H satisfies a growth condition at infinity such that the\nabove integral exists. In particular (L\u22121 \u25e6 L)(f ) = f if f is of exponential type.\nThe convolution of two functions\nf and g of exponential type is the function of exponential\nR\ntype given by f \u2217 g(t) = 0t f (u)g(t \u2212 u) du for any t \u2265 0. With du being Lebesgue measure,\nnotice f \u2217 g = g \u2217 f . The product theorem for the Laplace transform is that L transforms\nconvolutions into products:\nL(f \u2217 g)(z) = L(f )(z) * L(g)(z),\nfor any z with Re (z) sufficiently big. Equivalently, f \u2217 g(t) = L\u22121 (L(f ) * L(g))(t). The\nproof is a formal Fubini calculation as soon as one extends functions\nof exponential type\nR\u221e\nby zero on the non\u2013positive real line, whence f \u2217 g(t) equals 0 f (u)g(t \u2212 u) du.\n\nThere are a number of shifting principles for the Laplace transform. First, weighting any\nfunction f of exponential type with the function sending any t > 0 to exp (at), where a is\nany real number, introduces a shift by minus a in the Laplace transform:\nL(eat f )(z) = L(f )(z\u2212a).\nThe effect of weighting the Laplace transform of f by exp (az) depends on the sign of the\nreal number a. More precisely, let a be any non\u2013negative real number. Using the above\ncomplex inversion formula, one has:\n\u0001\nL\u22121 eaz L(f )(z) (t) = f (t + a),\nfor any t > 0. Weighting with exp (\u2212az) gives the following shifting theorem:\n\u0001\nL\u22121 e\u2212az L(f )(z) (t) = 1(a,\u221e) (t)f (t \u2212 a),\nfor any positive real number t. Herein 1X is the characteristic function of any set X. This\nis proved calculating the Laplace transform of the right hand side.\n\n\f5\n\nValuation of Paris options\n\nThe integration and differentiation principles for the Laplace transform describe the behaviour of the Laplace transform upon multiplication by integral powers of the complex\nvariable z. Using partial integration in the defining integral of the Laplace transform:\nL(f (n) )(z) = z n * L(f )(z) \u2212 f (0) (0)z n\u22121 \u2212 * * * \u2212f (n\u22121) (0)z 0 , for any non\u2013negative integer n\nand any complex number z in the half\u2013plane of convergence for L(f ). In particular,\n\u0001\nL f (n) (z) = z n * L(f )(z),\n\nif f is such that for any non\u2013negative integer k less than n its k\u2013th derivative f (k) vanishes\nat zero. This last formula holds in general if one considers n\u2013fold integration as differentiation of the negative order \u2212n. More precisely, the Laplace inverse of z \u2212n * L(f )(z),\nfor any non\u2013negative integer n, is given as the n\u2013fold iterated integral In (f ) of f . This is\nrecursively defined by I0 (f ) = f , and\nZ t\nIm+1 (f )(t) =\nIm (f )(u) du ,\n0\n\nfor any positive real number t, and any non\u2013negative integer m.\n\nPart I\n\nParis options\n\n4. Black\u2013Scholes framework for valuating contingent claims: For our analysis\nwe place ourselves in the Black\u2013Scholes framework and use the risk\u2013neutral approach to\nvaluating contingent claims. In this set\u2013up one has two securities. First there is a riskless\nsecurity, a bond, that has the continuously compounding positive interest rate r. Then\nthere is a risky security whose price process S is modelled as follows. Start with a complete\nprobability space equipped with the standard filtration of a standard Brownian motion on\nit that has the time set [0, \u221e). On this filtered space one has the risk neutral measure Q,\na probability measure equivalent to the given one, and a standard Q\u2013Brownian motion B\nsuch that S is the strong solution of the following stochastic differential equation:\ndSt = (r \u2212 \u03b4) * St * dt + \u03c3 * St * dBt ,\n\nt \u2208 [0, \u221e).\n\nHerein the positive constant \u03c3 is the volatility of S. The constant \u03b4 depends on the security\nmodelled. For instance, it is zero if S is a non\u2013dividend paying stock.\n5. Paris options: This paragraph dicusses the Paris barrier options of [CJY, \u00a72].\nTheir new idea for cushioning the impact of the underlying hitting the barrier is as follows. They require the underlying S to spend a minimum time D > 0 above or below their\nprespecified barrier L \u2265 0 before the option is knocked in or knocked out.\nThe Paris down\u2013and\u2013in call to be considered in the sequel is the following European\u2013style\ncontingent claim on S written at time t0 and with time to maturity T . Its payout at T is\nthat of a call on S with exercise price K:\n\b\n(ST \u2212 K)+ = max ST \u2212 K, 0 ,\n\nif St is less than L during a connected subperiod of length at least D of the monitoring\nperiod [t0 , T ]. Equivalently, there is a point in time a such that the interval I = (a, a + D)\n\n\f6\n\nMichael Schr\u00f6der\n\nis contained in the lifespan [t0 , T ] of the option and St < L for any t in I. Otherwise the\ncall expires worthless.\nIn the sequel, fix any time t during [t0 , T ] at which the Paris down\u2013and\u2013in call has not\nyet been knocked in. The time\u2013t value Cd,i of this call is then a function of K, \u03c4 = T \u2212t,\nS0 , r, \u03b4, L and D. In the sequel, mostly any of these arguments is suppressed from the\n\u2212\ndefined in\nnotation. The valuation problem depends on an excursion time HL,t = HL,D,t\nthe sequel such that the Paris down\u2013and\u2013in call is knocked in before its maturity T if and\nonly if HL,t \u2264 T . Using the arbitrage pricing principle, the time\u2013t price Cd,i of the Paris\ndown\u2013and\u2013in call is then given by the conditional Q\u2013expectation:\ni\nh\nCd,i = e\u2212r\u03c4 Et \u03c6(ST ) * 1{HL,t \u2264T } ,\nwith \u03c6(ST ) being equal to the plain vanilla call payout (ST \u2212 K)+ , and denoting the\ncharacteristic function of the event HL,t \u2264 T by 1{HL,t \u2264T } .\nIn defining HL,t at time t two constellations are to be distinguished. Namely, either today's security price St is equal to or above the barrier L, or it is below L. In the first case\nwith St \u2265 L, the Paris down\u2013and\u2013in call is knocked in before its maturity T iff S remains\nsmaller than L for all points in time of an interval of length at least D contained in [t, T ].\nThus let HL,t in this case denote the first time s greater than or equal to t+D such that\nSu < L for any time u in the interval (s\u2212D, s).\nIn the second case where St < L, the security price S has already been staying below L\nfor some connected period time during the lifetime of the option. The down\u2013and\u2013in call is\nthen knocked in before its time to maturity T if the following happens. The security price\nS continues to stay below L also during the period of time from today until the point in\ntime t+d with d smaller than D, i.e., one has Su < L for all u in (t, t+d). Thus define\nHL,t = t+d in this case. If the level L is hit by S before time t+d, however, the clock\nfor the minimum lenght D is restarted. So define HL,t in this case to be the first time s\ngreater than or equal to t+D such that Su < L for any u in the subinterval (s\u2212D,s) of\nthe positive real line.\nThe discussion of Paris barrier options would not be complete without having referred to\n[CJY, \u00a72] for details on the whole family of Paris barrier options. Calls and puts with either of the following barrier types: down\u2013and\u2013out, down\u2013and\u2013in, up\u2013and\u2013out, up\u2013and\u2013in.\nValuating these eight types of options is reduced in a standard way to the case of the above\nParis down\u2013and\u2013in call. Indeed, put\u2013call parities are given in [CJY, \u00a75], and [CJY, \u00a74.2]\nreduces the valuation of the out\u2013calls to that of the in\u2013calls, mutatis mutandis. This paper\nthus concentrates on valuating the Paris down\u2013and\u2013in call, in the sequel also referred to\nas the Paris option for simplicity.\n\nPart II\n\nLaplace transforms\n\n6. Laplace transforms of the value of the Paris option: This paragraph discusses\nthe Laplace transforms of the densities for the the Paris option of paragraph five.\n\n\f7\n\nValuation of Paris options\n\nThe basic valuation identity: This notion of density is made precise by by the following basic valuation identity for the time\u2013t price Cd,i of the Paris option:\nZ \u221e\n2\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2212 r+ \u031f2 *\u03c4\ne\u031fx * St * e\u03c3x \u2212K * hb (\u03c4, x) dx ,\nCd,i = e\n\u03b2(St )\n\nwith the Paris option density hb given by:\n\u0014\nZ \u221e\n\u2217\nE 1{Hb\u2217 <u} p\nhb (u, y) =\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(x\u2212y)2 \u0015\n\u2212\n1\n\u2217\n* e 2*(u\u2212Hb ) d\u03bc\u2217 (x) ,\n\u2217\n2\u03c0 * (u\u2212Hb )\n\nfor any real numbers u > 0 and y, and where \u03b2(St ) = \u03c3 \u22121 log(K/St ), where Hb\u2217 = HL,t \u2212t,\nand with \u03bc\u2217 = \u03bcb,D,\u2212 the measure for Brownian motion at time Hb\u2217 . By construction,\nhb (u, ) is zero for u less than D, respectively d depending on today's situation.\nLaplace transforms of the densities: With the proof of the basic valuation identity\npostponed to the end of this paragraph, the Laplace transforms of hb with respect to time\nare discussed next. For any fixed real number y they are recalled to be defined by:\nZ \u221e\n\u0001\ne\u2212zt hb (t, y) dt ,\nL hb ( , y) (z) =\n0\n\nfor any complex number z with sufficiently big real part. Moreover define the function \u03a8 by:\nZ \u221e\n2\n\u2212 x2 +zx\ndx ,\n\u03a8(z) =\nx*e\n0\n\nfor any complex number z, and choose on the complex plane with the non\u2013positive real\naxis deleted the square root defined using the principal branch of the logarithm. The\ncomputations of [CJY, \u00a7\u00a75, 8] can then be summarized as follows.\nProposition A: For any real number y, the Laplace transform of hb ( , y) is a holomorphic function on the right complex half\u2013plane.\nProposition B: Suppose b = \u03c3 \u22121 log(L/St ) is non\u2013positive. For any fixed real number\ny, the Laplace transform of hb ( , y) is given by:\n\u0001\nL hb ( , y) (z) = \u221a\n\n\u221a\n\u221ab\n2Dz\nD\ne\n\nD\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n2Dz \u03a8( 2Dz )\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nx*\n\n\u221a\n2\n\u2212 x \u2212|b\u2212x\u2212y| 2z\n2D\ne\n\ndx ,\n\nfor any complex number z with positive real part.\nIf b = \u03c3 \u22121 log(L/St ) is positive, i.e., when today's security price St is below the barrier\nL, we have modified the Paris option of [CJY]. Today's situation is then such that the\nprice of the security has already been staying below the barrier L for a certain connected\nperiod of time during the lifetime of the Paris options. For the Paris option to be knocked\nin the price thus has to stay below the barrier L only for another connected period time\nof a length d < D from today, i.e., Su < L for all u in [t, t+d). In this way, Paris options\nnow can be valuated at any point of their monitoring periods. The desirability of this\nmodification has been pointed out to me by Pliska. I regard the following modification of\nthe valuation results of [CJY] as a direct result of his suggestions.\n\n\f8\n\nMichael Schr\u00f6der\n\nProposition C: Suppose b = \u03c3 \u22121 log(L/St ) is negative. For any real number y, the\nLaplace transform of hb ( , y) is given on the right half\u2013plane as the following four\u2013term\nsum of Laplace transforms:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010 b \u0011 \u0010\n\u0001\n* L hb,1 ( , y) + L hb,2 ( , y)\nL hb ( , y) = Erfc \u221a\n2d\n\u0010 b \u0011\n\u0010 b \u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010 b \u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\n\u221a\n+ Erfc \u221a\nErf\n* L hb,3 f ( , y) + Erf\n* L hb,4 ( , y)\n2d\n2d\n2d\nHerein hb,k are the functions on the positive real line times the real line defined by:\n1\nhb,3 (u, y) = 1(d,\u221e) (u) *\nu\u2212d+D\n\n\u001a\u221a\n(y\u2212b)2\nu\u2212d \u2212 2(u\u2212d)\n\u221a\n*e\n2\u03c0\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u0013\u001b\n\u0012\n(y\u2212b)2\n1 (y\u2212b) D \u2212 2(u\u2212d+D)\n(y\u2212b) D\n,\n*e\n\u2212 \u221a\nErfc p\n2 u\u2212d+D\n2(u\u2212d)(u\u2212d+D)\n\n1\nhb,4 (u, y) = 1(d,\u221e) (u) \u221a\n* fb,u (y)\n2\u03c0u\n\ny2\n\u2212 2u\n\nwhere\n\nfb,u (y) = e\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212e\n\n(y\u22122b)2\n2u\n\n,\n\nfor any positive real number u and any real number y, while the remaining two functions\nare defined using their Laplace transforms as follows:\n\u0001\nL (hb,1 ( , y) (z) =\n\nZ\n\nd\n\n0\n\n\u2212zw\n\ne\n\u221a\n\u221a\nD 2z \u03a8( 2Dz )\n\n\u0001\n1\nL (hb,2 ( , y) (z) = \u221a\n2\u03c0d\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nd\n\n\u2212zw\n\n\u0012Z\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\ne\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2z \u03a8( 2Dz )\n\nx*\n\n\u0012Z\n\n\u221a\n2\n\u2212 x \u2212|b\u2212x\u2212y| 2z\n2D\ne\n\u221a\n\u2212|x\u2212y| 2z\n\ne\nR\n\n\u0013\ndx \u03bcb (dw) ,\n\n\u0013\nfb,d (x)dx \u03bcb (dw) ,\n\nfor any positive real number y and any complex number z with positive real part.

As a first step, the valuation problem for the Paris\noption of paragraph two is transcribed in in terms of a restarted\u2013at\u2013time\u2013t normalized\nBrownian motion with drift W \u2217 as follows. With B \u2217 the restarted\u2013at\u2013time\u2013t Brownian\nmotion B \u2217 (u) = B(t+u)\u2212B(t), consider the Brownian motion with drift:\nWu\u2217 =\n\n\u0011\n\u0010S\n1\nt+u\n= \u031fu+Bu\u2217 ,\nlog\n\u03c3\nSt\n\nu \u2208 [t, \u221e),\n\n\fValuation of Paris options\n\n9\n\nwhose drift coefficient is \u031f = \u03c3 \u22121 * (r \u2212\u03b4 \u2212 \u03c3 2 /2). Recalling b = \u03c3 \u22121 * log(L/St ), one has\n\u2217,\u2212\nSt+u < L iff W \u2217 (u) < b by construction. Thus define the excursion time Hb\u2217 = Hb,D,0\nfor\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nW as follows. If today's value W (0) of W is greater than or equal to b then Hb is the\nfirst time s greater than or equal to D such that W \u2217 (u) < b for any time u in the interval\n(s\u2212D, s) of the positive real line. Suppose today's value W \u2217 (0) of W \u2217 is less than b. Set\nHb\u2217 = d if W \u2217 (u) < b for any time u in the interval [0, d) remaining for W \u2217 to have stayed\na connected period of time of length D below L. Otherwise, Hb\u2217 is the first time s greater\nthan or equal to D such that W \u2217 (u) < b for any time u in the subinterval (s \u2212D, s) of\nthe positive real line. One has Hb\u2217 = HL,t \u2212t, whence HL,t \u2264 T iff Hb\u2217 \u2264 \u03c4 = T \u2212t. Using\nStrong Markov, the valuation problem for the Paris option thus transcribes as follows:\nh\u0010\n\u0011+\ni\n\u03c3W \u2217 (\u03c4 )\n\u2212K\nCd,i = e\u2212r\u03c4 E Q St * e\n* 1{Hb\u2217 \u2264\u03c4 } .\nAs a next step, using the particular case [KS, p.196f] of the Cameron\u2013Martin\u2013Girsanov\ntheorem, change measure from Q to Q\u2217 such that the drift term in W \u2217 is killed and W \u2217\nbecomes a Q\u2217 \u2013Brownian motion. Change measure in the expectation expressing the price\nCd,i and iterate the Q\u2217 \u2013expectation thus obtained to get:\n2\u0001\nh\nh\nii\n\u0001+\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2212 r+ \u031f2 *\u03c4 \u2217\nE 1{Hb\u2217 \u2264\u03c4 } E \u2217 e\u031fW\u03c4 St * e\u03c3W\u03c4 \u2212K\nFHb\u2217 .\nCd,i = e\n\nUsing Hb\u2217 as F\u2013stopping time apply the strong Markov property of Brownian motion in\nthe conditional expectation. The resolvent thus obtained can be further simplified with the\nrandom variables Hb\u2217 and W \u2217 (Hb\u2217 ) being independent. With \u03bc\u2217 the measure for W \u2217 (Hb\u2217 ),\nthe basic valuation identity follows.\n7. An intermediate identity for the proofs of the Laplace transforms: Adopt\nthe notation introduced in the previous paragraph six in the basic valuation identity for\nParis options. Then one has the following intermediate identity:\nLemma:\n\nFor any real number y, one has:\n\u221a\nZ\n\u2212|x\u2212y| 2z\ni\nh\n\u2217\n\u0001\ne\n\u2212zHb\n\u221a\n*\nE\u2217 e\nL hb ( , y) (z) =\n\u03bc\u2217 (dx) ,\n2z\nR\n\nfor any complex number z in the right complex half\u2013plane.\nFor proving the Lemma interchange the Laplace transform with the two exponential integrals defining the Paris option density hb (u, y) in paragraph six to get:\n\u0015\n\u0014Z \u221e\nZ\n(x\u2212y)2\n\u0001\n\u2212\n1\n\u2217\n\u2212zu\n\u2217\n2(u\n\u2212\nH\n)\nb\np\ndu \u03bc\u2217 (dx) .\n*e\ne\nL hb ( , y) (z) =\nE\n\u2217)\n\u2217\n2\u03c0(u\u2212H\nHb\nR\nb\n\nIn this last integral successively change variables w = u\u2212Hb\u2217 and separate the expectation\nfrom the Laplace transform to get:\nZ\nh\ni \u0012 1\n(x\u2212y)2 \u0013\n\u2212 2u\n\u2217 \u2212zHb\u2217\n*L \u221a\nE e\n*e\n(z) \u03bc\u2217 (dx).\n2\u03c0u\nR\nUsing [Sch, \u00a73] for the Laplace transform completes the proof of the Lemma.\n\n\f10\n\nMichael Schr\u00f6der\n\n8. Computing the Laplace transform in the case b equal to zero: The computation of the Laplace transforms of paragraph six for hb is by reduction to the case b equal\nto zero where one has to show the key relation:\nh z2 \u2217 i\n\u221a\n\u2217 \u2212 2 H0\n* \u03a8(z D ) = \u03a8(0) = 1,\nE e\nfor any complex number z with positive real part. This paragraph reviews the key ideas\nof its proof in [CJY, \u00a78]. The computations in this case b equal to zero are based on the\nAz\u00e9ma martingale and properties of the Brownian meander. The Az\u00e9ma martingale is the\nmartingale on [0, \u221e) for the slow Brownian filtration F+ given for any t \u2265 0 by:\n\u221a\n\u03bct = (sgn Wt\u2217 ) t\u2212gt .\nHerein gt is defined as the supremum over all real numbers s \u2264 t such that W \u2217 (s) = 0.\nThe process given by:\nmt (u) = \u221a\n\n\u0001\n1\nW \u2217 gt + u(t\u2212gt ) ,\nt\u2212gt\n\nu \u2208 [0, 1]\n\nis a Brownian meander and is independent of the \u03c3\u2013subfield F+ (gt ) of the slow Brownian\nfiltration. Its law is independent of t and given by x exp (\u2212x2 /2) * 1(0,\u221e) dx. The tautology\nW \u2217 (t) = mt (1) * \u03bct thus implies the following identity:\n\u0014\n2\ni\n\u2217\nz2\n\u2212z t\n\u2217 zWt \u2212 2 t\nF + (gt ) = e 2 * \u03a8(z * \u03bct ) ,\nE e\nfor any positive real number z. Fixing any such z, the crucial point is to exhibit the product\n\u03c8(\u2212z*\u03bc(H0\u2217 )) exp (\u2212z 2 H0\u2217 /2) as a martingale. This is achieved by a boundedness argument\nshowing the argument of the above conditional expectation to be uniformly integrable for\nany time t up to H0\u2217 . Using another form of the optional stopping theorem it follows that\nthe Q\u2217 \u2013expectation of the martingale stopped at H0\u2217 equals the Q\u2217 \u2013expectation of it at\ntime zero, whence \u03a8(0) which equals one. With the random variables H0 and W \u2217 (H0\u2217 )\nindependent, the key relation results. This is an identity between functions holomorphic\nin particular on the right half\u2013plane. Using the identity theorem, it thus remains valid for\nany complex number z with positive real part.\n9. Computing the Laplace transform for b non\u2013positive: Using \u00a77 Lemma the\nproof of \u00a76 Proposition B reduces to compute the expectation of exp (\u2212zHb\u2217 ), for any complex number z with positive real part, and the density \u03bc\u2217 . Following [CJY, \u00a78.3.3], this\nis by reduction to the case b equal to zero of the previous paragraph. Indeed, decompose\nHb\u2217 as follows:\nHb\u2217 = Tb + H0\u2217\u2217 .\nHerein Tb is the first passage time of W \u2217 to the level b, and H0\u2217\u2217 is defined as follows. It\nis the smallest non\u2013negative point in time s at which the restarted\u2013at\u2013time\u2013Tb Brownian\nmotion W \u2217\u2217 (u) := W \u2217 (Tb +u)\u2212W \u2217 (Tb ) = W \u2217 (Tb +u) \u2212 b is zero for the first time after\nhaving been less than zero for a connected period of time of length at least D.\nTo compute the expectation required, notice that Tb and H0\u2217\u2217 are independent random\nvariables. The conditional expectation at time Tb of exp (\u2212(w2 /2)Hb\u2217 ) thus is the product\n\n\f11\n\nValuation of Paris options\n\nof exp (\u2212(w2 /2)Tb ) and the expectation of exp (\u2212(w2 /2)H0\u2217\u2217 ). With the law of H0\u2217\u2217 equivalent to that of H0\u2217 , this last expectation is given by the key relation of paragraph eight.\nSo it is deterministic in particular. Take expectations to time zero of this product. The\nexpectation of exp (\u2212(w2 /2)Tb ) that remains to be computed is the Laplace transform of\nthe law of Tb at w2 /2. Using [Sch, \u00a73] it is equal to exp (\u2212|b|(2 * (w2 /2))1/2 ) and thus to\nexp (+bw). With w = (2z)1/2 one gets:\ni\nh \u221a\nh\ni\n\u221a\n\u2217\n1\n1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n* E \u2217 e\u2212 2z *Tb =\n* eb 2z .\nE \u2217 e\u2212z*Hb =\n\u03a8( 2Dz )\n\u03a8( 2Dz )\nTo determine \u03bc\u2217 notice the tautology W \u2217 (Hb\u2217 ) = W \u2217\u2217 (H0\u2217\u2217 ) + b. Thus W \u2217 (Hb\u2217 ) \u2264 x iff\nW \u2217\u2217 (H0\u2217\u2217 ) \u2264 x\u2212b. From the discussion of the case b equal to zero, the law of W \u2217\u2217 (H0\u2217\u2217 )\nis that of the negative of m1 . As a consequence:\n\u2217\n\nQ W\n\n\u2217\n\n(Hb\u2217 )\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2208 dx = 1(\u2212\u221e,b] (x) * (b \u2212 x) * e\n\n(x\u2212b)2\n2D\n\n*\n\ndx\n.\nD\n\nSubstitute into \u00a77 Lemma and change variables w = b\u2212x to obtain \u00a76 Proposition B for\nany complex number z with sufficiently big positive real part. Extend to the whole right\nhalf\u2013plane using the consequence of the key relation of paragraph eight that \u03a8((2Dz)1/2 )\nhas no zeroes there. This completes the proof of \u00a76 Proposition B and the b\u2013non\u2013positive\npart of \u00a76 Proposition A.\n10. Computing the Laplace transform for b positive: The proof of Proposition C\nof paragraph six modifies the argument of [CJY, \u00a78.3.3]. Using \u00a77 Lemma, the first task is\nto compute the density \u03bc\u2217 and the Q\u2217 \u2013expectation of exp (\u2212zHb\u2217 ) for any complex number\nz with positive real part. The two cases where the level b is hit before or after time d are\nto be distinguished. Thus decompose the underlying probablity space \u03a9 into the set A\non which the first passage time Tb of W \u2217 to the level b is less than or equal to d and its\ncomplement \u03a9 \\ A on which Tb is bigger than d. This induces the decomposition:\nh\ni\nh\ni\nh\ni\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nE \u2217 e\u2212zHb = E \u2217 1A * e\u2212zHb + E \u2217 1\u03a9\\A * e\u2212zHb\nof the Q\u2217 \u2013expectation of the random variable exp (\u2212zHb\u2217 ). By construction Hb\u2217 = d on\nthe complement of A. So the second above summand is exp (\u2212zd)Q\u2217 (Tb > d). On the set\nA the level b is reached before the critical time d and the clock for the excursion is reset\nto zero at the first passage time Tb to the level b. Accordingly one has the decomposition:\nHb\u2217 = Tb + H0\u2217\u2217 ,\nwith H0\u2217\u2217 defined as follows. It is the smallest s \u2265 0 at which the restarted\u2013at\u2013time\u2013Tb\nBrownian motion W \u2217\u2217 (u) := W \u2217 (Tb +u)\u2212W \u2217 (Tb ) = W \u2217 (Tb +u)\u2212b is zero for the first time\nafter having been less than zero for a connected period of time of lenght at least D.\nWith this random variable H0\u2217\u2217 independent from Tb , the conditional expectation of the\nrandom variable 1A * exp (\u2212zHb\u2217 ) at time Tb thus equals exp (\u2212zTb ) times the expectation\nof exp (\u2212zH0\u2217\u2217 ). The key relation of paragraph eight now applies to H0\u2217\u2217 and identifies\nthis last expectation as the reciprocal of \u03a8((2zD)1/2 ). The expectation of 1A * exp (\u2212zTb )\n\n\f12\n\nMichael Schr\u00f6der\n\non the other hand, is given by integrating exp (\u2212zw) from zero to d against the density\n\u03bcb of Tb .

Analytic properties of \u03a8: This paragraph collects and discusses pertinent analytical properties of the function \u03a8 for any complex number w recalled to be given by:\nZ \u221e\n2\n\u2212 x2 +wx\n\u03a8(w) =\nx*e\ndx .\n0\n\nDeveloping the linear exponential factor of the integrand in its series and integrating the\nresulting series term by term, gives the following series expansion:\n\u03a8(w) =\n\nX\u221e\n\nn=0\n\nn\n\u0010 n+2 \u0011\n22\n* wn .\n*\u0393\nn!\n2\n\nThis series is absolutely convergent for any complex number w, and convergence is uniform on compact sets. Rearrange it in its even and odd order terms. Replacing w by\nits negative leaves unchanged the even part and produces a minus sign in the odd part.\nUsing the duplication identity for the gamma function and redeveloping the square order\nexponential series that results as a factor, then gives the following key identity:\n\u03a8(w) = \u03a8(\u2212w) +\n\n\u221a\n\n2\u03c0 * w * e\n\nw2\n2\n\nconnecting the values of \u03a8 on the right half\u2013plane with those on the left half\u2013plane.\n\n\f14\n\nMichael Schr\u00f6der\n\n12. A uniform asymptotic expansion:\nThe aim of this paragraph is to prove for\nR\u221e\nthe function \u03a8 given by \u03a8(w) = 0 x exp (\u2212x2 /2 + wx) dx, for any complex number w,\nthe following uniform asymptotic expansion.\nLemma:\n\nFor any complex number w with positive real part, one has the expansion:\nN\n\u0010\n1\u0011 1\n1 X\n* 2k + RN+1 (w),\n(\u22121)k+1 * 2k * \u0393 k+\n\u03a8(\u2212w) = \u221a\n2\nw\n\u03c0\nk=1\n\nfor any positive integer N , whose remainder term RN+1 satisfies the estimate:\nRN+1 (w) \u2264 2 *\nCorollary:\n\n1\n(2N +1)!\n*\n.\n2(N+1)\nN!\n|w|\n\nFor any complex number z not a non\u2013positive real number, one has:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\n\u03a8(\u2212 z ) = + R2 ( z )\nz\n\nwith R2 (z 1/2 ) being big Oh in |z|\u22122 for the absolute value of z going to infinity.\nThe Corollary is an immediate consequence of the Lemma. Recall that the principal branch\nof the logarithm has been chosen. The proof of the Lemma is in two steps. As a first step,\nestablish the asymptotic expansion with the remainder term satisfiying the estimate:\nRN+1 (w) \u2264\n\nCN\n2(N+1)\ncos\n(\u03c0/2\u2212\u03b4z )\n\n*\n\n1\n|w|2(N+1)\n\nwhere\n\nCN =\n\n(2N +1)!\n,\nN ! * 2N\n\nif | arg(w)| \u2264 \u03c0/2\u2212\u03b4w for \u03b4w > 0. For this develop the square exponential factor of the\nintegrand for \u03a8(\u2212w) into its Taylor series up to the (N\u22121)\u2013st term and integrate the\nresulting sum term by term. Using the duplication formula for the gamma function the\ncoefficients of the asymptotic expansion follow on shifting the summation index by one.\nProceeding analogously, the absolute value of the remainder term can be majorized by CN\ntimes the reciprocal of the 2(N+1)\u2013st power of the real part of w. With w in the right\nhalf\u2013plane, Re (w) equals |w| * cos(\u03b8) for an angle \u03b8 of absolute value less than or equal to\n\u03c0/2\u2212\u03b4w as above. Thus cos(\u03b8) is bigger than the positive constant cos(\u03c0/2\u2212\u03b4w ) completing\nthe proof of the first step.\nAs a second step, extend the above asymptotic expansion by showing the above estimate\nto be valid also for any complex numbers w such that \u03c0/4 < | arg(w)| \u2264 3\u03c0/4\u2212\u03b4w . This\nis based on the following integral representation:\nZ ei\u03b8 *\u221e\n\u03be2\n\u2212 2 \u2212w\u03be\n\u03a8(\u2212w) =\n\u03be*e\nd\u03be ,\n0\n\nfor any complex number w. Herein \u03b8 is any fixed any angle of absolute value less than \u03c0/4\nand the integral is over the path sending any positive real number R to R * exp (i\u03b8). This\nrepresentation is proved using Cauchy's theorem. Indeed, the absolute value of the above\nintegrand is majorized by |\u03be| * exp (\u2212Re (\u03be 2 )/2 \u2212 Re (w\u03be)). It thus converges uniformly to\n\n\fValuation of Paris options\n\n15\n\nzero with the radius R going to infinity on that part of the circle in the origin of radius R\nwhich is parametrized by angles of absolute value less than \u03c0/4.\nNow fix any positive real number \u03b5 smaller than \u03b4w . If arg(w) is negative, choose the angle\n\u03b8 = +\u03c0/4\u2212\u03b5 in the above integral representation. Otherwise let \u03b8 = \u2212\u03c0/4+\u03b5. In the sequel\nthe case arg(w) positive is considered. In the above integral representation then develop\nthe square exponential factor of the integrand into its Taylor series up to the (N \u22121)\u2013st\norder. In the identity:\nZ \u221e\nZ ei\u03b8 *\u221e\ni\u03b8\n2k+1 \u2212w\u03be\n2(k+1)i\u03b8\nR2k+1 e\u2212we R dR\n\u03be\ne\nd\u03be = e\n0\n\n0\n\nwrite w exp (i\u03b8) = |w| exp (i(\u03b8 + arg(w))). Notice that the angle \u03b8 + arg(w)) is between\n\u03b8 +\u03c0/4 = \u03b5 and \u03b8 +3\u03c0/4\u2212\u03b4w = \u03c0/2\u2212(\u03b4w \u2212\u03b5). Thus it is smaller than \u03c0/2 in particular.\nAs a consequence, the realR part of \u03b7 = w exp (i\u03b8) is positive. Recalling that \u0393(a + 1) is\n\u221e\nequal to the integral \u03b7 a+1 0 exp (\u2212\u03b7t)ta dt, the above integral is thus seen to be equal\nto w\u22122(k+1) * \u0393(2(k+1)). The coefficients of the asymptotic expansion follow. Proceeding\nanalogously, the absolute value of the remainder term RN+1 (w) is majorized by CN times\nthe reciprocal of the 2(N+1)\u2013st power of |w|*cos(\u03b8+arg(z)). Recalling the above bounds for\nits argument, the cosine herein is positive and bounded from below by cos(\u03c0/2\u2212(\u03b4w \u2212\u03b5)),\nfor any positive \u03b5 less than \u03b4w . Thus it is bounded from below by cos(\u03c0/2\u2212\u03b4w ), completing\nthe proof of the second step.\nTo complete the proof of the uniform asymptotic expansion, apply the estimate of the first\nstep with any \u03b4z strictly between \u03c0/4 and \u03c0/2 if | arg(w)| is less than \u03c0/4. Otherwise,\napply the estimate of the second step with \u03b4w strictly between \u03c0/4 and \u03c0/2. In both cases,\ncos(\u03c0/2\u2212\u03b4w ) is minorized by cos(\u03c0/4) = 2\u22121/2 . Cancelling the powers of two one gets the\nfactor two. This completes the proof of the uniform asymptotic expansion.\nReferences:\n[CJY] M. Chesney, M. Jeanblanc\u2013Picqu\u00e9, M.
