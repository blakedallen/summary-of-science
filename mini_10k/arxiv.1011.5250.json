The DSEs are the equations of motion of a quantum\nfield theory. They form an infinite hierarchy of coupled integral equations for the Green's functions (n-point functions)\nof the theory. Bound states (mesons, baryons) appear as poles in the appropriate Green's functions, and, e.g., the BetheSalpeter bound state equation appears after taking residues in the DSE for the appropriate color singlet vertex. The\nFaddeev equation for the 3-quark structure of baryons follows in a similar way from the residues of the appropriate\nvertex DSE. For recent reviews on the DSEs and their use in hadron physics, see Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4].\nIn the Euclidean metric that we use throughout, the DSE for the dressed quark propagator is\nS(p)\u22121\n\nZ \u039b\n\n= Z2 i /p + Z4 m(\u03bc) + Z1\n\nq\n\ng2 D\u03bc\u03bd (p \u2212 q)\n\n\u03bbi\n\u03b3\u03bc S(q) \u0393i\u03bd (q, p) ,\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere D\u03bc\u03bd (k) is the renormalized dressed-gluon propagator, \u0393i\u03bd (q, p) is the renormalized dressed quark-gluon vertex.\nR\nR\nWe use q\u039b to denote \u039b d 4 q/(2\u03c0)4 with \u039b being the mass scale for translationally invariant regularization. The\nrenormalization condition is S(p)\u22121 = i\u03b3 * p + m(\u03bc) at a sufficiently large spacelike \u03bc 2 , with m(\u03bc) the renormalized\nmass at renormalization scale \u03bc. We use \u03bc = 19 GeV. The Zi (\u03bc, \u039b) are renormalization constants.\nBound state pole residues of the inhomogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for the relevant vertex, yield the\nhomogeneous BSE bound state equation\n\u0393ab\u0304 (p+ , p\u2212 ) =\n\nZ \u039b\nq\n\nK(p, q; P)Sa (q+ )\u0393ab\u0304 (q+ , q\u2212 )Sb (q\u2212 ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere K is the renormalized qq\u0304 scattering kernel that is irreducible with respect to a pair of qq\u0304 lines. Quark momenta\nare q+ = q + \u03b7P and q\u2212 = q\u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b7)P where the choice of \u03b7 is equivalent to a definition of relative momentum q;\nobservables should not depend on \u03b7. The meson momentum satisfies P2 = \u2212M 2 .\nA viable truncation of the infinite set of DSEs should respect relevant (global) symmetries of QCD such as\nchiral symmetry, Lorentz invariance, and renormalization group invariance. For electromagnetic interactions and\nGoldstone bosons we also need to respect color singlet vector and axial vector current conservation. The rainbow\u03bbi\n\u03bbi\nladder (LR) truncation achieves these ends by the replacement K(p, q; P) \u2192 \u22124\u03c0 \u03b1eff (k2 ) Dfree\n\u03bc\u03bd (k) 2 \u03b3\u03bc \u2297 2 \u03b3\u03bd along\ni\n\n\u03bb\nwith the replacement of the DSE kernel by Z1 g2 D\u03bc\u03bd (k)\u0393i\u03bd (q, p) \u2192 4\u03c0 \u03b1eff (k2 ) Dfree\n\u03bc\u03bd (k) \u03b3\u03bd 2 where k = p \u2212 q, and\n\u03b1eff (k2 ) is an effective running coupling. This truncation is the first term in a systematic expansion [5, 6] of K;\nasymptotically, it reduces to leading-order perturbation theory. These two truncations are mutually consistent: together\n\n\fTABLE 1.

This ensures that\nthe chiral limit ground state pseudoscalar bound states are the massless Goldstone bosons from dynamical chiral\nsymmetry breaking [7, 8]; and ensures electromagnetic current conservation [9]. The ladder-rainbow kernel found to\nbe successful for light quark hadrons [8, 10] can be written \u03b1eff (k2 ) = \u03b1 IR (k2 ) + \u03b1 UV (k2 ). The IR term implements\nthe strong infrared enhancement in the region 0 < k2 < 1 GeV2 required for sufficient dynamical chiral symmetry\nbreaking. The UV term preserves the one-loop renormalization group behavior of QCD: \u03b1eff (k2 ) \u2192 \u03b1s (k2 )1loop (k2 )\nin the ultraviolet with N f = 4 and \u039bQCD = 0.234 GeV. The strength of \u03b1 IR along with two quark masses are fitted to\nhq\u0304qi, m\u03c0/K .\nSelected light quark meson results are displayed in Table 1. The charge radii are obtained from the calculated charge\nform factors of \u03c0 and K [11, 12] in the triangle diagram approximation. This approximation is the dynamical partner\nof LR truncation: charge is automatically conserved. Vector meson dominance is a natural outcome here since it is\ngenerated by the inhomogeneous BSE for the dressed photon-quark vertex. Related to this, the decay constants for\na vector meson to a pair of pseudoscalars are obtained by direct computation of the triangle diagram [13], or from\nanalysis of the timelike electromagnetic form factors [14]. The Abelian axial anomaly coupling g\u03c0\u03b3\u03b3 and associated\ninteraction radius are obtained from electromagnetic transition form factors [14], which also yield the radiative decay\nconstants. The three-body leptonic decays of the kaon [15] are also shown.\nIt has remained true for many years that efforts [17] to solve truncated versions of the DSEs for the QCD gauge sector\nn-point functions that determine the ladder-rainbow kernel have been unable to produce sufficient kernel strength.\nThat is, an empirically acceptable amount of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (and associated ground state\nhadron mass scales) has long been underestimated that way. Thus our infrared kernel component has remained semiphenomenological while we seek to characterize it's deficiencies through application to new classes of observable.\nSome efforts to go beyond the semi-phenomenological ladder-rainbow truncation so as to progressively reduce the\namount of phenomenology have employed an explicit 1-loop dressing of the gluon vertex: a gluon loop [18], or a\npion loop [19]. However, an amount of phenomenology is still needed in these approaches to reproduce light quark\nphysics. Furthermore, a study [20, 21] of this type of a diagram-by-diagram approach to the vertex and BSE kernel,\nwithin a schematic model of simplified momentum dependence, shows that the produced color factors run rapidly out\nof control.\nIt is only recently that large volume lattice-QCD calculations [22] and analysis have established that the gluon 2point function is non-zero in the IR limit, corresponding to a gluon effective mass of \u223c 0.5 GeV, and that the ghost 2point function is no more singular than its perturbative behavior. These modern lattice-QCD results have recently [23]\nbeen combined to produce a kernel for the quark DSE that yields an empirically acceptable amount of dynamical\nchiral symmetry breaking. The gluon-quark vertex in that approach might be used in the recently developed method\n\n\ffor generalized BSE kernel construction [24] to produce a physical and capable pathway to a wider variety of hadron\nbound state calculations.\n\nNOVEL PERSPECTIVE ON THE QUARK CONDENSATE\nRecently it has been advocated that the quark condensate, rather than being a spacetime independent constant filling all\nspace, is really a property of the Bethe\u2013Salpeter wavefunction of hadrons [25]. Clear evidence for such a perspective\nis provided by the exact QCD expression for the residue \u03c1\u03c0 at the pseudoscalar meson pole in the 3-point function\ndescribing the coupling of a pseudoscalar field with quarks [7]\ni\u03c1\u03c0 = \u2212h0|q\u0304i\u03b35 q|\u03c0i = Z4 (\u03b6 , \u039b) trcd\n\nZ \u039b\n\u039bIR\n\nd4q\n\u03b35 S(q+ ) \u0393\u03c0 (q; P) S(q\u2212 ) .\n(2\u03c0)4\n\n(3)\n\nDue to Goldsone's Theorem, and the resulting Goldberger-Treiman relation in which the chiral meson's invariant BSE\namplitude associated with \u03b35 is the chiral quark scalar self-energy divided by the chiral f\u03c0 , one can show rigorously\nthat [7]\nZ \u039b\nd4q\nlim f\u03c0 h0|q\u0304\u03b35 q|\u03c0i = \u2212Z4 (\u03b6 , \u039b) trcd\nS (q; \u03b6 ) = hq\u0304qi0\u03b6 .\n(4)\n4 0\nm\u0302\u21920\n\u039bIR (2\u03c0)\nThus the chiral condensate is a property of the qq\u0304 projection of the chiral pion Bethe-Salpeter wavefunction, and thus\nfrom this perspective is not defined away from this finite-sized bound state. Although it is true that the (point) pion\ncloud effect on the pion leads to an infinite charge radius, the qq\u0304 dressed quark core remains of finite size and that is\nwhere Eq. (4) places the condensate. Furthermore this is in accord with quark and gluon confinement; these virtual\nfields only exist inside their hadronic containers.\nThe quark condensate represents an enormous energy density, comparable to the interior of compact stellar objects.\nThe above perspective would eliminate the 1045 overestimate of the cosmological constant from the QCD vacuum\nenergy density. If the electroweak quanta turn out to be composites of higher mass entities, like technicolor quarks, the\nvacuum field we presently call the Higgs scalar is needed only inside those containers. This could eliminate the 1056\ndiscrepancy from that sector of the Standard Model.\n\nVALENCE QUARK DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE PION AND KAON\nData for the momentum-fraction probability distributions of quarks and gluons in the pion have primarily been inferred\nfrom Drell-Yan [26, 27, 28] and direct photon production [29] in pion-nucleon and pion-nucleus collisions, and semiinclusive e p \u2192 e NX reactions [30]. For a recent review of nucleon and pion parton distributions see Ref. [31].\nLattice-QCD is restricted to low moments of the distributions, not the distributions themselves [37]. Model calculations of deep inelastic scattering (DIS) parton distribution functions are challenging because it is necessary to have\nperturbative QCD features (including the evolution of scale) coexisting with a covariant nonperturbative model made\nnecessary by the bound state nature of the target. Aspects of chiral symmetry have led to DIS calculations within the\nNambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio model [38, 39, 40] but there are a number of difficulties with this approach [39, 40], among\nthem a point structure for the pion BS amplitude at low model scale and a marked sensitivity to the regularization\nprocedure due to the lack of renormalizability. Constituent quark models have also been employed [41, 42], with the\ndifficulties encountered in such studies considered in Ref. [43]. Instanton-liquid models [44] have also been used. In\nthese approaches, it is difficult to have pQCD elements join smoothly with nonperturbative aspects. All of these issues\ncan in principle be addressed if parton distribution functions can be obtained from a model based on the DSEs, and in\nparticular styled after the approach we have previously made for the related pion electromagnetic form factor [11, 12].\nIn the Bjorken kinematic limit, DIS selects the most singular behavior of a correlator of quark fields of the target\nwith light-like and causal distance separation z2 \u223c 0+ . With incident photon momentum along the negative 3-axis,\nthe kinematics selects z+ \u223c z\u22a5 \u223c 0 leaving z\u2212 as the finite distance conjugate to quark momentum component xP+ ,\nwhere x = Q2 /2P * q is the Bjorken variable, q2 = \u2212Q2 is the spacelike virtuality of the photon, and P is the target\nmomentum. To leading order in the operator product expansion, the target structure functions are proportional to the\nprobability distribution function q f (x). This in turn is given, in manifestly invariant form, by the correlator [45, 46, 47]\nq f (x) =\n\n1\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nd\u03bb e\u2212ixP*n\u03bb h\u03c0(P)|\u03c8\u0304 f (\u03bb n) \u03b3 * n \u03c8 f (0)|\u03c0(P)ic .\n\n(5)\n\n\f0.4\n\n1.2\n1\n\nuK(x)/u\u03c0(x)\n\nxuv(x)\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\nDSE (Hecht et al.) 27 GeV\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nx\n\n0.6\nDrell Yan (Badier et al., 1989)\n\n0.4\n\n2\n\nDSE-BSA 27 GeV\n2\nE615 \u03c0N Drell-Yan 16.4 GeV\n2\nExpt NLO analysis 27 GeV\n\n0.1\n\n0.8\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\nDSE-BSE, Q0 = 0.33 GeV , (\u0393\u03c0 = E , F )\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\nDSE-BSE, Q = 27 GeV , (\u0393\u03c0 = E , F )\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nx\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFIGURE 1.

The solid line is our preliminary result from DSE-BSE calculations [35, 32, 31]; the experimental\ndata is from [36, 26].\n\nwhere f is a flavor label. In the frame where the target has infinite momentum, q f (x) is the quantum mechanical\nprobability that a single f-parton has momentum fraction x = k * n/P * n [47]. In the above n\u03bc , and partner p\u03bc , are\nlight-like vectors satisfying n2 = p2 = 0 and n * p = 2 and they form a convenient basis for the longitudinal sector of\n4-vectors. The dominant component of q is parallel to n. One can always choose a frame such that k * n = k+ and\nk * p = k\u2212 . Note that q f (x) = \u2212q f \u0304(\u2212x), and that the valence quark amplitude is qvf (x) = q f (x) \u2212 q f \u0304(x). It follows from\nEq. (5) that 01 dx qvf (x) = h\u03c0(P)|J f (0) * n|\u03c0(P)i/2P * n = F\u03c0 (0) = 1. Approximate treatments should at least preserve\nvector current conservation to automatically obtain the correct normalization for valence quark number.\nIn ladder-rainbow truncation, which treats only the valence qq\u0304 structure of the pion, Eq. (5) yields the explicit form\nR\n\nqvf (x) =\n\ni\n2\n\nZ \u039b\np\n\ntrcd [\u0393\u03c0 (p, P) S(p) \u0393(n) (p; x) S(p) \u0393\u03c0 (p, P) S(p \u2212 P)] ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u0393(n) (p; x) is a generalization of the dressed vertex that a zero momentum photon has with a quark. It satisfies\nthe usual inhomogeneous BSE integral equation (here with a LR kernel) except that the inhomogeneous term is\n\u03b3 * n \u03b4 (p * n \u2212 xP * n). This selection of LR dynamics exactly parallels the symmetry-preserving dynamics of the\ncorresponding treatment of the pion charge form factor at q2 = 0 wherein the vector current is conserved by use\nof ladder dynamics at all three vertices and rainbow dynamics for all 3 quark propagators [11, 12]. Here the number of\n \u0304 in the pion is automatically unity since the structure of Eq. (6), along with the canonical\nvalence u-quarks (or d)\nR\nR\nnormalization of the qq\u0304 BS amplitude \u0393\u03c0 (p, P), ensures 01 dx qvu (x) = 1 because 01 dx \u0393(n) (p; x) gives the Ward\nIdentity vertex.\nEq. (6) is in Minkowski metric so as to satisfy the constraint on p * n, but LR dynamical information on the various\nnon-perturbative elements such as S(p) and \u0393\u03c0 (p, P) is available only in Euclidean metric [10]. Since q f (x) is obtained\nfrom the hadron tensor W \u03bc\u03bd which in turn can be formulated from the discontinuity T \u03bc\u03bd (\u03b5) \u2212 T \u03bc\u03bd (\u2212\u03b5), we observe\nthat all enclosed singularities from the difference of Wick rotations cancel except for the cut that defines the object\nof interest. With use of numerical solutions for dressed propagators and BS amplitudes that give an accurate account\nof light quark hadrons, our DIS calculations significantly extend the exploratory study made in Ref. [33]. That work\nemployed phenomenological parameterizations of these elements.\nIn Fig. 1 we display our DSE result for the valence u-quark distribution evolved to Q2 = (5.2 GeV)2 in comparison\nwith \u03c0N Drell-Yan data [28] with a scale quoted as Q2 = (4.05 GeV)2 . We also compare with a recent NLO reanalysis\nof the data at scale Q2 = (5.2 GeV)2 . The distribution at the model scale Q20 is evolved higher by leading order DGLAP.\nThe model scale is found to be Q0 = 0.57 GeV by matching the xn moments for n = 1, 2, 3 to the experimental values\nR\ngiven independently at (2 GeV)2 [48]. Our momentum sum rule result 01 dx x (u\u03b1 + d \u0304\u03b1 ) = 0.74 (\u03b1 = \u03c0), 0.76 (\u03b1 = K)\n\n\fat Q0 clearly shows the implicit inclusion of gluons as a dynamical entity in a covariant approach. The large x behavior\nin the form u(x) \u223c (1 \u2212 x)\u03b1 has long provided a contrast between previous parameterizations of experiment (\u03b1 \u223c 1.5)\nand QCD-based approaches (\u03b1 = 2 + \u03b3) where \u03b3 represents anomalous dimensional behavior that increases with scale.\nAt our model scale, \u03b1 = 2.08. Recently, the experimental data [28] has been reanalyzed [49] by an accounting for soft\ngluon processes, and the resulting experimental u(x) at Q2 = (4 GeV)2 , for x > 0.4 is essentially identical to the Hecht\net al. DSE calculation shown in Fig. 1. This eliminates the discrepancy between QCD and experiment here.\nThe ratio uK /u\u03c0 measures the dynamical effect of the local environment. In the kaon, the u-quark is partnered\nwith a significantly heavier partner than in the pion and this shifts the probability to relatively lower x in the kaon.\nOur preliminary DSE model calculation [35, 32, 31] is shown in Fig. 1 along with available Drell Yan data [36, 26].\nHere we include only the leading two invariants of the pion BS amplitude, E(k; P) and F(k; P), where k is qq\u0304 relative\nmomentum. For both amplitudes only the zeroth Chebychev moment in k * P is employed . This variable does not occur\nin static quantum mechanics, nor in the Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio point-coupling field theory model [38] which also cannot\naccommodate the k2 dependence. We do not make such a point meson approximation here; the k2 dependence comes\nfrom the BSE solutions. Nevertheless, the qualitative features of the ratio uK /u\u03c0 in Fig. 1 are adequately reproduced\nby a generalized Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio model [31].\nAn explicit analysis of the exponent \u03b1 in the large-x behavior q(x) \u223c (1 \u2212 x)\u03b1 can be made in the limit where the\npropagators in Eq. (6) have the dynamical quark self-energy replaced by a constant (constituent) mass and the vertex\nis taken to be \u03b3 * n \u03b4 (p * n \u2212 xP * n). These limits maintain consistency with the Ward Identity mentioned above. We\nalso truncate the pion Bethe-Salpeter vertex to just \u03b35 E\u03c0 (k2 ) and take E\u03c0 (k2 ) = N\u03c0 /(k2 \u2212 \u039b2\u03c0 ) where the relative qq\u0304\nmomentum is k = p \u2212 P/2. For x > 1/2 the pole in the spectator quark propagator is the only one in the upper half\nplane and the p\u2212 integral may be easily evaluated by the residue theorem to yield\nqv (x) =\n\n4Nc \u03c0 2\n(2\u03c0)4\n\nZ \u221e\n0\n\nd 2 p\u22a5\n\np2\u22a5 + m2q\n[x(1 \u2212 x)P2 \u2212 p2\u22a5 \u2212 m2q ]2\n\nE\u03c02 (k2 ) ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere now k2 is evaluated at the p\u2212 pole. It is convenient to change the integration variable to \u03bc = \u2212p2 where the\nlatter is the value at the p\u2212 pole. Then\nqv (x) =\n\n4Nc \u03c0 2\n(2\u03c0)4\n\nZ \u221e\n\nd\u03bc\n\u03bcm (x)\n\nxP2 + \u03bc + m2q 2\nE\u03c0 (\u2212P2 /4 \u2212 (\u03bc + m2q )/2) ,\n[\u03bc + m2q ]2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03bcm (x) = a/(1 \u2212 x) \u2212 xm2\u03c0 , with a = xm2q . This divergence of the lower limit for large x renders the result totally\ndependent upon the ultraviolet behavior of the propagators and bound state amplitudes.\nThe leading large x behavior of qv (x) \u223c (1 \u2212 x)\u03b1 comes from the leading divergent term of each factor of the\nintegrand. The integral can be expressed\nqv (x) = N\n\nZ \u221e\n\nd \u03bc\u0302\n0\n\na\n1\u2212x + b + \u03bc\u0302\na\n[ 1\u2212x\n+ c + \u03bc\u0302]2\n\n(\n\na\n+ d + \u03bc\u0302)\u2212n ,\n1\u2212x\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the physical case of Bethe-Salpeter bound state amplitudes E\u03c02 determined by one gluon exchange has n = 2.\nThe quantities a, b, c, d depend on the mass-dimensioned quantities and scales in the system and have only a\nnonsingular dependence upon x. Their details are not important. A change of variable to \u03bc\u0304 = (1 \u2212 x)\u03bc\u0302/a shows that the\nintegral scales as [(1 \u2212 x)/a]n when a/(1 \u2212 x) is greater than any physical mass scale in the system. Note that it is the\npair of bound state vertices that totally determine the large x exponent: if the argument of the bound state amplitude E\u03c0\nwas not singular at large x, the combined scaling effect of the propagators would vanish giving \u03b1 = 0. The presence of\ntrue bound state vertices provides a natural regularization of the integral and allows us to ignore explicit mathematical\nregularization at a higher scale. In a renormalizable field theory such as QCD, there is an overall regularization mass\nscale that can be taken to be much larger than any scale at which physical observable questions are to be asked of the\nformalism. In the above case the renormalization scale is to be much larger than a/(1 \u2212 x) for values of x where an\nasymptotic exponent is to be quoted.\nIf one were to consider the limit of a Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio model, the bound state vertices become constants and the\nmodel integral for qv (x) must be regularized, and the result, including the high x exponent becomes dependent on regularization scheme [31]. However, independent of scheme, any thus obtained exponent \u03b1 6= 0 would be unconstrained\nby the physical properties of the system.\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank C. D.
