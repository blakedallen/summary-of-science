They exhibit deterministic ballistic motion of the electrons as \"billiard\nballs\" and provide the possibility to tune their shape,\nsize, and electron number. A particularly intriguing feature is the connection between classical dynamics and\nthe statistical properties of the corresponding quantum\nsystem [6, 7]. For systems with mixed chaotic and regular dynamics, the Berry-Robnik formula [8] links the\nvolume ratio of regular and chaotic regions in classical\nphase space to the quantum-mechanical level distribution [9, 10].\nExternal magnetic fields pose, on the one hand, an\ninteresting complication to classical (and quantum) billiards [11], and, on the other hand, provide an easily accessible way to experimentally control the particle dynamics. Recently, magnetic fields have been\nused to manipulate electron transport in coupled electron billiards [12]. In many cases, e.g., in rectangular [13, 14, 15, 16] or triangular [17] billiards, an external magnetic field leads to mixed dynamics between\nregularity and chaoticity. The breaking of time reversal\nsymmetry due to the presence of a magnetic field results\nin new properties of the level spacing statistics of the\ncorresponding quantum system [18, 19].\nIn contrast to freely tunable parameters, such as external magnetic and electric fields, interactions between\nparticles are inevitably present in any realistic physical\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: erasanen@jyu.fi\n\nsystem. While single-particle billiards have been studied thoroughly for many years now, billiards of interacting particles are still a relatively young field. Classical\nbilliards for two interacting particles have been studied\nusing various models, e.g., Coulomb-like interactions in\na one-dimensional box [20] and in an isotropic [21] and\nanisotropic harmonic oscillator [22], as well as applying hard-sphere contact interaction in a rectangular [23]\nand a mushroom-shaped box [24]. The statistical mechanics of such systems has also been extensively studied recently [25]. Quantum-mechanically, interactioninduced chaos has been studied in a two-electron quantum dot [21, 22, 26], and, very recently, also in the framework of time-dependent density-functional theory [27, 28]\n\u2013 an approach that might enable examination of quantum\nchaos in systems containing a large number of interacting\nparticles.\nSingle-particle billiards have traditionally been studied\nby either reducing the dynamics of the system to a bouncing map (for magnetic single-particle billiards, see, e.g.,\n[29]), or by investigating the infinitesimal variations of\nthe trajectories using the method of Jacobi fields [30, 31].\nIn an interacting billiard, however, the trajectory of a\nparticle between successive bounces is not known in advance, as its motion is coupled to the motion of all other\nparticles. The locations of the bounces at the wall are not\ngiven by simple geometric considerations anymore, and\nthus the methods used to study single-particle systems\ndo not carry over in a straightforward way.\nIn this paper, we present a classical molecular dynamics scheme that allows to calculate the trajectories of interacting particles in an arbitrary 2D billiard system exposed to a uniform and perpendicular magnetic field. To\ndemonstrate the method, we focus on single- and twoparticle dynamics in rectangular billiards. In the singleparticle case, we present an efficient method to systematically obtain \"regular\" and \"chaotic\" regions in phase\nspace, which allows us to monitor the combined effect\n\n\f2\nof the magnetic field and the rectangle shape. We find\na pattern of increased regularity at integer aspect ratios.\nIn the two-particle case mostly chaotic behavior is found,\nbut also regular orbits at high magnetic fields. The relevance of the method in studying the classical limit of\ncollective effects in many-electron structures is discussed.\nII.\nA.\n\nMETHOD\n\nPropagation of particles\n\nTo calculate the trajectories of charged particles, we\nuse a modified velocity verlet algorithm suited for incorporating arbitrarily strong static homogeneous external\nmagnetic fields [32]. With a magnetic field B = (0, 0, B)\n\npointing in z direction, the acceleration of a charged particle reads\na(t) = aC (t) \u2212 \u03a9 ez \u00d7 v(t),\n\nwhere aC (t) is the velocity-independent part of the acceleration depending only on external forces, and \u03a9 =\nqB/m is the cyclotron frequency for a particle with\ncharge q and mass m. We use Hartree atomic units\nthroughout the paper, such that ~ = e = me =\n1/(4\u03c0\u01eb0 ) = 1 and the velocity of light has the value\nc \u2248 137.036. Furthermore, the factor 1/c in the Lorentz\nforce law is absorbed into B, such that we have \u03a9 = B\nfor electrons. Within the modified velocity verlet algorithm presented in Ref. [32], each particle is propagated\nusing the following equations:\n\ni\n1h\nrx (t + \u2206t) = rx (t) +\nvx (t) sin(\u03a9\u2206t) \u2212 vy (t) [cos(\u03a9\u2206t) \u2212 1] +\n\u03a9\ni\n\u0003\n\u0002\n1 h\nC\n3\n+ 2 \u2212 aC\nx (t) [cos(\u03a9\u2206t) \u2212 1] \u2212 ay (t) [sin(\u03a9\u2206t) \u2212 \u03a9\u2206t] + O (\u2206t)\n\u03a9\ni\n1h\n\u2212 vy (t) sin(\u03a9\u2206t) \u2212 vx (t) [cos(\u03a9\u2206t) \u2212 1] +\nry (t + \u2206t) = ry (t) \u2212\n\u03a9\ni\n\u0003\n\u0002\n1 h\nC\n+ 2 \u2212 aC\n(t)\n[cos(\u03a9\u2206t)\n\u2212\n1]\n\u2212\na\n(t)\n[\u2212\nsin(\u03a9\u2206t)\n+\n\u03a9\u2206t]\n+ O (\u2206t)3\ny\nx\n\u03a9\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\naC (t + \u2206t) = aC [r1 (t + \u2206t), . . . , rN (t + \u2206t); t + \u2206t]\n\n(4)\n\n1h\n\u2212 aC\nvx (t + \u2206t) = vx (t) cos(\u03a9\u2206t) + vy (t) sin(\u03a9\u2206t) +\ny (t) [cos(\u03a9\u2206t) \u2212 1] +\n\u03a9\n\u0014\ni\nC\n1\naC\nx (t + \u2206t) \u2212 ax (t)\n+aC\n\u2212\n[cos(\u03a9\u2206t) \u2212 1] \u2212\nx (t) sin(\u03a9\u2206t) +\n\u03a92\n\u2206t\n#\nC\n\u0002\n\u0003\naC\ny (t + \u2206t) \u2212 ay (t)\n\u2212\n[sin(\u03a9\u2206t) \u2212 \u03a9\u2206t] + O (\u2206t)3\n\u2206t\n\n(5)\n\n1h\n\u2212 aC\nvy (t + \u2206t) = vy (t) cos(\u03a9\u2206t) \u2212 vx (t) sin(\u03a9\u2206t) \u2212\nx (t) [cos(\u03a9\u2206t) \u2212 1] \u2212\n\u03a9\n\"\nC\ni\naC\n1\ny (t + \u2206t) \u2212 ay (t)\n\u2212aC\n(t)\nsin(\u03a9\u2206t)\n+\n\u2212\n[cos(\u03a9\u2206t) \u2212 1] \u2212\ny\n\u03a92\n\u2206t\n\u0015\nC\n\u0002\n\u0003\naC\nx (t + \u2206t) \u2212 ax (t)\n[\u2212 sin(\u03a9\u2206t) + \u03a9\u2206t] + O (\u2206t)3\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2206t\nB.\n\n(1)\n\nPhase space maps for single-particle billiards\n\nIn a single-particle billiard system, the kinetic energy,\nand consequently also the velocity v = (vx2 + vy2 )1/2 of the\nparticle, is a constant of motion. The dynamics of the\n\n(6)\n\nbilliard is determined by the boundary conditions (see\nbelow) and the relative strength of the magnetic field.\nThe latter quantity is here given by a parameter\n\u03bc = Rc /Lx ,\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\n\n1. We choose a 2D cross section (x, vx ) through the 3D\nphase space and divide it into a number of cells.\n2. For one cell, we pick two phase space points in the\ncell that are very close to each other, but not identical up to the numerical precision.\n3. We follow the trajectories through these two\npoints for a certain propagation distance stot using Eqs. (2)\u2013(6), and record all cells in the cross\nsection through which they pass.\n4. After having propagated for a distance stot , we calculate the distance between the points in phase\nspace, which is a measure of the \"regularity\" of\nthe trajectory. We save this distance to all cells\nwe have passed. If a cell has already been passed\nby a previous run, we take the maximum of the\ndistances.\n5. We start over from point (2) by picking another cell\nthat has not yet been traversed by a trajectory, and\nrepeat the whole process until all cells have been hit\nby a trajectory at least once.\n6. We then plot the distances stored in the cells of\nour 2D cross section as a color-coded \"matrix plot\".\nIn the following, these plots will be called \"phasespace maps\". Small numbers correspond to \"regular\" phase space cells, large numbers to \"chaotic\"\ncells (see below for details).\nThe algorithm can be efficiently parallelized, because\ntrajectories originating from different cells can be propagated independent of each other. Our code uses the\nMessage Passing Interface (MPI) and a master/slave\nparadigm. The master process keeps track of the phase\nspace map and distributes free cells, i.e., cells that have\nnot yet been hit by any trajectory) to the workers. The\nworkers perform the propagation of the trajectories and\ncommunicate the traversed cells and the phase space distance after the propagation distance stot back to the\nserver.\nIII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSingle particle\n\nWe demonstrate our computational scheme by considering rectangular billiards with side lengths Lx = 1\n(fixed) and Ly = \u03b2 Lx (varied), where \u03b2 is the aspect ratio. The strength of the external magnetic field has been\n\n0.6\n\n\u2206\n\n(a)\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n(b)\n\n2\n0.3\n1.5\n\n\u2206\n\n1.5\nvx\n\nwhere Rc = v/B is the cyclotron radius and Lx is\nthe length of one side of the system (here a rectangle). The constant of motion can be used to reduce\nthe four-dimensional phase space (x, y, vx , vy ) to a threedimensional (3D) one, where we have chosen the space\nspanned by (x, y, vx ). To identify regular and chaotic regions in this phase space, we use the following procedure:\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\u22120.3\n\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.5\n\n0.5\n\n\u22120.25\n\n0\nx\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\nchaotic\nregular\n20\n\n40\n60\np (%)\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFIG. 1: (color online). (a) Phase space map for a rectangular\nbilliard with aspect ratio \u03b2 = 2. The color map indicates\nthe phase-space distance \u2206 between two orbits having a small\ninitial perturbation. (b) Ordered phase-space distances for all\nthe cells plotted in (a). The dashed line shows the threshold\n(\u2206 = 0.1) between chaotic and regular motion.\n\nfixed to B = 1, so that the cyclotron radius Rc = v/B\nis determined by varying the velocity of the particle. In\nthe single-particle case, we focus on the dynamics of the\nsystem as a function of \u03b2 and \u03bc = Rc /Lx . In both of\nthe limits \u03bc \u2192 0 and \u03bc \u2192 \u221e the motion is regular,\nthe former corresponding to infinitely many circular orbits (cf. Landau-level condensation in confined quantum\nsystems) and the latter corresponding to linear motion at\nzero field, which is always regular in rectangular billiards.\nAt 0 < \u03bc < \u221e the dynamics is generally mixed except\nat particular values of \u03bc when the system is completely\nchaotic [13].\nFig. 1(a) shows an example of a phase space map calculated for the parameters \u03b2 = 2 and \u03bc = 0.6. The\nscheme described in Sec. II B has been used to calculate\nthe figure. The cross section through the phase space\nhas been partitioned into 150 cells in each direction (x\nand vx ). The color scale indicates the phase-space distance \u2206 after propagating the trajectories by a distance\nof stot = 60 Lx.\nWe find distinct areas of regularity associated with\nKAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) islands [1].\nFigure 1(b) shows the phase-space distances of all cells\nsorted in ascending order. The sharp onset of the\ncurve indicates a distinct separation between regular and\nchaotic motion. To consistently determine this separation, we choose a threshold of \u2206 = 0.1 shown in the\nfigure as a dashed line. Thereby, this particular system\nis regular by a fraction of 25%. We presume that by using\na very high resolution it should be possible to determine\nand categorize phase-space cells corresponding to weak\nchaos [33]. This topic is, however, beyond the scope of\nthis work and left for future research.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the proportions of regularity, estimated as shown in the example in Fig. 1, for square\n(\u03b2 = 1) billiards as a function of \u03bc. We find excellent\nagreement with the result of Berglund and Kunz [13] that\nhas been calculated using an exact method. This confirms the accuracy of the proposed scheme up to strongly\ncurvilinear motion, i.e., small values of \u03bc.

The phase space is\neight-dimensional, and instead of the phase space map\ndescribed in section II B, we calculate so-called bouncing\nmaps by recording the values (x, vx ) corresponding to the\nbounces of one of the particles on the lower boundary\n(y = 0) of the system.\nWe investigate the dynamics with different values for\nthe ratio\n\n0\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) Proportions of regularity in rectangular\nbilliards as a function of \u03bc and the aspect ratio \u03b2.\n\npect the method to be reliable also in more complicated\nsystems with many particles and/or different boundaries.\nTo assess the effect of the billiard shape onto the dynamics, we have calculated the proportions of regularity\nas a function of both \u03bc and the aspect ratio \u03b2. The result is shown in Fig. 3 for 0.3 < \u03b2 < 3.2 in steps of 0.1\nand for 0.2 < \u03bc < 2 in steps of 0.01. Fig. 3 required the\ncalculation of 5430 phase space maps, each consisting of\n22 500 cells, thereby demonstrating the numerical efficiency of the scheme. Note that Fig. 3 is not symmetric\naround \u03b2 = 1, because we have varied Ly = \u03b2 and thus\nthe system area is not kept constant.\nWe find several islands of increased regularity centered\nat \u03b2 = n/2 with n = 1, 2, 3, . . .. Overall, the \"most\nregular\" case is the square billiard (\u03b2 = 1), as expected.\nA more detailed analysis of the regularity patterns and\ntheir connections to the periodic orbits will be performed\nelsewhere.\n\n\u03b3=\n\nEk (t = 0)\nEp (t = 0)\n\n(8)\n\nfor the initial configuration, where Ep = |r \u2212 r\u2032 |\u22121 /2 is\nthe Coulomb potential energy and Ek = v 2 /2 is the kinetic energy. The quantity \u03b3 essentially determines how\n\"strongly interacting\" the system is, as it fixes the average ratio of Ek (t) and Ep (t) for the full time-dependent\nsystem through the initial energy components. In physical applications this ratio could be varied by changing\neither the particle density or the system size. A wellknown example of the limit where the potential energy\ndominates is the Wigner crystal [34] forming in the electron gas at low densities.\nIn the following examples we have fixed the initial\npositions of the particles to (x1 , y1 ) = (2/5, 3/10) and\n(x2 , y2 ) = (7/10, 7/10). The initial Coulomb energy in\nthis case is Ep (t = 0) = 2. After fixing \u03b3 in Eq. (8),\nthe initial kinetic energy Ek (t = 0) is distributed equally\nto both\nparticles, and the initial velocities v1 = v2 =\n\u221a\n(0, Ek ) point in the y direction. The initial configuration is visualized in Fig. 4.\nThe remaining parameter to be fixed is \u03bc(t = 0) defined in Eq. (7). Note that again we fix only the initial\ncondition, and in the time-dependent run, the values of\n\u03bc for both particles vary due to changes in the velocities.\n\n\f5\nE p = 30 E k\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\ny\n\ny\n\nEk = 30 E p\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\nx\n\n1\n\nx\n\n1\n\n1\n\nvx\n\nvx\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22121\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nx\n\nFIG. 5: (color online).

Lower panel: Bouncing map for the particle with\nthe blue (black) trajectory in the upper panel.\n\nSince the initial velocity is determined through \u03b3, we fix\n\u03bc(t = 0) through B in contrast with the single-particle\ncase where we always had B = 1.\nFirst, we set \u03b3 = 30 and the magnetic field to zero\n(\u03bc \u2192 \u221e) and propagate sufficiently long to obtain a\nbouncing map with a large number of points. Figure 5\nshows the trajectories of the particles up to t = 5 (upper panel) and the bouncing map up to t = 3 \u00d7 104\n(lower panel). The number of bounces is \u223c 7.8 \u00d7 105 .\nApart from a few exceptions, the particles remain separated in the left and right parts of the system due to\nthe Coulomb repulsion. However, as the interaction is\nrelatively weak, both particles move in the y direction,\nalmost undisturbed from their initial conditions. Close\nto the left and right boundaries, where the interaction\nis weakest, the dynamics is most regular. This can be\nseen in the trajectories, which are almost straight lines\nin that regime. In addition, the bouncing map shows regular curvilinear albeit blurry zones (see the inset in the\nlower panel of Fig. 5). These features may be designated\nas quasi-regular motion in the system [33].\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nx\n\nFIG. 6: (color online). Same as Fig. 5 but for relatively\nstrongly interacting particles.\n\nIn the following example we keep the magnetic field at\nzero but increase the relative amount of interaction energy such that \u03b3 = 1/30. The trajectories and bouncing\nmap are shown in Fig. 6. Here, the dynamics is very different from the weakly interacting case. Both particles\noccupy the whole area of the system, but due to their\nstrong repulsion, the corners are considerably more occupied than the central region, which is characterized by\n\"scattering\" trajectories of high curvature. The bouncing\nmap in the lower panel is completely chaotic. Increasing\nthe interaction even further would enable to study classical Wigner crystallization [34] in a dynamic picture.\nIn the present system, for example, the Wigner crystal\nwould consist of two diagonal configurations summed up\nto a four-point crystal.\nFinally, we consider two systems with \u03b3 = 2, where\nthe magnetic field is set to values corresponding to \u03bc(t =\n0) = 1/4 and \u03bc(t = 0) = 1/32, respectively. The trajectories are plotted in Fig. 7. In the first case (a) the\nsystem seems to be fully chaotic, whereas the latter configuration (b) leads to regular isolated orbits forming a\nring-like structure. In this case, the \"interaction axis\"\n(i.e., the dashed line in Fig. 4) performs a circular mo-\n\n\f6\n\ny\n\n(a)\n\n1\n\n\u03bc = 1/4\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n(b)\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n\u03bc = 1/32\n\n1\n\nx\n\nthe gain in kinetic energy (at the expense of Coulomb\nenergy) results in an increased radius of the cyclotron\nmotion. The different curvature of the trajectory on the\ndifferent sides of the \"circle\" gives rise to a bent cycloidal\nmotion which can, for the right choice of the parameters,\nlead to a bound motion as depicted in Fig. 7(b).\nThe above results on the classical dynamics in magnetic fields suggest to study the relation to the corresponding quantum mechanical situation in semiconductor quantum dots. In fact, interesting vortex patterns\nand edge localization have been found in rectangular\nmany-electron quantum dots at high magnetic fields [35].\nSuch patterns may exist \u2013 in a statistical picture \u2013 also in\na classical system. A particularly interesting case would\nbe the quantum-mechanical analog of the bound motion\nshown in Fig. 7(b). Moreover, our scheme would allow\nto study the effects of interactions on the classical limit\nof electron transport in billiard arrays [12].\n\ny\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nx\n\nFIG. 7: (color online).

M.\nReimann and M. Manninen, Rev. Mod. Phys. 74, 1283\n\nWe have introduced a computational scheme based on\nmolecular dynamics to study classical billiards of interacting particles in external magnetic fields. The accuracy\nand efficiency of the method has been demonstrated in\nrectangular billiards. We have found excellent agreement\nwith numerically exact method in single-particle square\nbilliards as a function of the magnetic field. Changing\nthe aspect ratio \u03b2 of the rectangle leads to islands of\nincreased regularity at \u03b2 = n/2 with n = 1, 2, 3, . . .. In\nsquare billiards of two interacting particles we have found\nsignatures of quasiperiodic orbits at weak interactions,\nand localization at strong interactions. Large magnetic\nfields may lead to regular patterns also for interacting\nparticles. The scheme opens up the path to study the\nclassical limit of realistic many-particle systems related\nwith, e.g., electronic transport experiments in mesoscopic\nstructures.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Roland Brunner for useful disdcussions.\nThis work was supported by the Academy of Finland.\n\n(2002).\n[5] R.
