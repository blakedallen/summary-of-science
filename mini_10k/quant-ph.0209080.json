Schr\u00f6dinger equations are of great current interest. Indeed they have the characteristic property that analytic expressions for a finite number of energy levels and their corresponding eigenfunctions\ncan be obtained. These Q.E.S. equations have been first investigated in [1] and since then they have been studied\nextensively (for a detailed review see f.i. [2]). Actually one can find two different points of view for analyzing these\nequations.\nFirst, the number of analytic solutions is related [3] to the dimension of the irreducible representations of the\nLie algebra sl(2, R). More specifically the corresponding Schr\u00f6dinger Hamiltonians can be written, up to a change\nof variables and a change of eigenfunctions, as linear and quadratic combinations of the sl(2, R) generators, these\npreserving the finite-dimensional space of the solutions.\nSecond, the number of analytic solutions is fixed at the start (essentially two [4] or three [5]). Except in the case\nof two solutions [6], the corresponding Schr\u00f6dinger Hamiltonians cannot, in general, be related to any Lie algebra.\nEach of these two points of view has its own advantages and disadvantages. The Lie algebraic approach is elegant,\nstraightforward and the associated potentials can be treated in a global way. However it concerns only a few interactions which have been listed in [3]. The second approach deals with a bigger and not yet known number of potentials\nbut no general method to study them is available. Until now, the only method found in the literature to construct\nthese Q.E.S. potentials is the one developed in [4] and [5]. It is based on a recursive construction of a finite number\nof supersymmetric partners [7]. It will be recalled in Section IV with more details but let us already mention that the\nKuliy-Tkachuk method is too constraining and thus misses some Q.E.S. interactions. Some of them are given in the\nfollowing.\nThe purpose of this paper is then to propose an alternative to this method in order to approach the Q.E.S. equations\nwith a known number (we will concentrate essentially on three) of analytic solutions in a general way. To do so we\nwill make use of the general algorithm developed in [8].\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we explain the formalism of our method. It is illustrated through\nexamples in Section III. In Section IV, we compare our method with the one of Kuliy and Tkachuk. Finally, we draw\nour conclusions in Section V.\nII.\n\nTHE GENERAL APPROACH\n\nWe concentrate on the one-dimensional and time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd2\n\u2212 2 + V (x) \u03c8N (x) = EN \u03c8N (x).\ndx\n\n(1)\n\nThe eigenfunctions \u03c8N (x) as explained in [8] are written as\n\u03c8N (x) = g(x) [f (x)]\n\n\u03bbN\n\nN\nX\n\n)\nc(N\nm [h(x)]\n\nm\n\n(2)\n\nm=0\n\nwhere the function g(x) is a weight factor, [f (x)]\u03bbN is introduced due to eventual singularities in V (x), and the\n(N )\nquantities (real or complex) cm are expansion coefficients on the basis h(x). Actually this basis plays the prominent\nrole in our approach in the sense that each of the functions entering our formalism can be expanded in this basis\naccording to\ng \u2032 (x) = \u2212g(x)\nf (x) =\n\nM\nX\n\nM\nX\n\nl\n\ngl1 [h(x)] ,\n\n(3)\n\nl=0\n\nl\n\n(4)\n\nl\n\n(5)\n\nl\n\n(6)\n\nfl0 [h(x)] ,\n\nl=0\n\nf \u2032 (x) =\n\nM\nX\n\nfl1 [h(x)] ,\n\nl=0\n\nh\u2032 (x) =\n\nM\nX\nl=0\n\nh1l [h(x)] ,\n\n\f3\nthe prime standing for the derivative with respect to x. The upper-right index for the coefficients gl1 , fl0 , fl1 , h1l\nindicates the derivative order of the corresponding expanded function. The upper summation index M is in general\nan arbitrary positive integer, big enough to be the highest value of all upper summation indexes in Eqs. (3)\u2013(6), the\nadded expansion coefficients being vanishing when necessary. Finally the upper summation index N is also a positive\ninteger left arbitrary until we consider specific examples in the next Section.\nIn [8], we have limited ourselves to specific potentials of the form\nV (x) =\n\nVX\nmax\n\nVk [f (x)]\n\nk\n\nX\n\nvl,k [h(x)]\n\nl\n\n(7)\n\nl\n\nk=\u2212Vmin\n\nthe coefficients Vk and vl,k being fixed according to the interaction we want to deal with while l runs in the space of\nintegers. The positive integers Vmin and Vmax are also determined once the interaction is given. The expansion (7)\nhas been proposed to include all known Q.E.S. potentials. However, in the present paper, we do not have to ask that\nthe potential obeys a given expansion due to the fact that the number of eigenfunctions is fixed at the start. (We will\nnevertheless see in the next Section that the determined potential will be of the type of Eq. (8).)\nMore precisely, if we consider three eigenstates as stated in the Introduction, we have two possibilities: Either these\neigenfunctions are of the form given in Eq. (2) with N = L, L + 1, L + 2, or they coincide with Eq. (2) with the same\n(N )\nfixed N = L, but different values of cm in order to have linearly independent polynomials in the basis h(x). The\nanalysis of already known Q.E.S. potentials reveals that the Kuliy-Tkachuk approach is included in the first possibility\nwhile the Lie algebraic one can be found in the second possibility.\nIn both cases, we have the first eigenstate equal to\n\u03c8L (x) = g(x) [f (x)]\n\n\u03bbL\n\nL\nX\n\nc(L)\nm [h(x)]\n\nm\n\n(8)\n\nm=0\n\nand, for simplicity, associated to the energy\n\nEL = 0.\n\n(9)\n\nSuch a requirement determines the potential V (x) up to the presence of parameters which will be fixed asking for the\nexistence of the other solutions. More precisely, by inserting Eqs. (8) and (9) in Eq. (1) and using Eqs. (3)\u2013(6), the\npotential is\no\u22121 \u001a\nn\nk+l+m+n+s\np+q+m\n1 1 (L)\nfk0 fl0 gm\ngn cs [h(x)]\nV (x) = fp0 fq0 c(L)\n[h(x)]\nm\n1 1 (L)\n\u2212 mfk0 fl0 gm\nhn cs [h(x)]\n\nk+l+m+n+s\u22121\n\n0 (L)\n+ \u03bbL lfl1 h1k fm\ncs [h(x)]\n\nk+l+m+s\u22121\n\nk+l+s\n1 (L)\n+ (\u03bb2L \u2212 \u03bbL )fk1 fl1 c(L)\n\u2212 2\u03bbL gk1 fl0 fm\ncs [h(x)]k+l+m+s\ns [h(x)]\n\nk+l+m+s\u22121\n1 1 (L)\n+ 2\u03bbL sfk0 fl1 h1m c(L)\n\u2212 2sfk0 fl0 gm\nhn cs [h(x)]k+l+m+n+s\u22121\ns [h(x)]\n\u001b\nk+l+m+n+s\u22122\n.\n+ fk0 fl0 h1m h1n c(L)\ns(s\n\u2212\n1\n+\nm)\n[h(x)]\ns\n\n(10)\n\nIn this expression and the following ones, we have, for simplicity, omitted all the summation indexes but it is understood\nthat there is a summation on each repeated index (except L).\nNow the potential of Eq. (10) has to be constrained so that there exist other solutions to it. For the first possibility\nmentioned above, i.e., the one including in particular the Kuliy-Tkachuk potentials, we just have to require that the\nfunctions (2) with N = L + 1 and N = L + 2 are solutions of Eq. (1) with V (x) fixed according to Eq. (10). This\ngives rise to (two) systems of algebraic equations (instead of differential ones). This is the main advantage, besides its\ngenerality, of our approach based on the development of all functions in the h(x)-basis. These systems are specified\nby vanishing the different coefficients of linearly independent terms in\n(N )\n\n\u2212fk0 fl0 h1m h1n c(L)\ns ct\n\n(N )\n\nk+l+m+n+s+t\u22122\n\nk+l+m+n+s+t\u22121\n\n1 1 (L)\n+ 2tfk0 fl0 gm\nhn cs ct [h(x)]\n\u001a\n(N\n)\n(N )\nk+l+m+s+t\u22121\nk+l+m+s+t\u22121\n\u2212 2\u03bbN fk0 fl1 th1m c(L)\n[h(x)]\n+ (\u03bbL \u2212 \u03bbN ) fk0 fl1 h1m lc(L)\n[h(x)]\ns ct\ns ct\n\u001b\nk+l+m+s+t\nk+l+s+t\n0 1 1 (L) (N )\n1 1 (L) (N )\n\u2212 2fk gl fm cs ct [h(x)]\n+ (\u03bbL + \u03bbN \u2212 1)fk fl cs ct [h(x)]\n\nt(t \u2212 1 + m) [h(x)]\n\n(N )\n\n+ 2\u03bbL fk0 fl1 h1m sc(L)\ns ct\n\n(N )\n\n1\n[h(x)]k+l+m+s+t\u22121 \u2212 2fk0 fl0 gm\nsh1n c(L)\ns ct\n(N )\n\n+ fk0 fl0 h1m h1n s(s \u2212 1 + m)c(L)\ns ct\n\n[h(x)]\n\nk+l+m+n+s+t\u22122\n\n[h(x)]k+l+m+n+s+t\u22121\n(N )\n\n\u2212 EN fk0 fl0 c(L)\ns ct\n\n(h(x))k+l+s+t = 0,\n\n(11)\n\n\f4\nwhere N = L + 1, L + 2. It is clear that if we want to consider the case of two only eigenstates, we have to solve only\none system, the one corresponding to N = L + 1. We can also extend this approach to the case of more than three\nsolutions. The potential of Eq. (10) is then more and more constrained until it is impossible to fulfill the constraints.\nIn what concerns the second possibility, i.e., the one associated to the Lie algebraic approach, we have to ask for\n(L)\n(L)\nthe function in Eq. (2) to be a solution of Eq. (1) with N = L, together with other coefficients than cm , say c\u0303m .\nThe system of constraints is now:\n(L)\n\n\u2212fk0 h1m h1n c(L)\ns c\u0303t (t \u2212 s)(t \u2212 1 + m + s) [h(x)]\n(L)\n\n\u2212 2\u03bbL fk1 h1n c(L)\ns c\u0303t (t \u2212 s) [h(x)]\n\nk+n+s+t\u22121\n\n= 0.\n\n(L)\n\nThe number of independent sets of coefficients c\u0303t\ngiven in Eq.

(12) gives the number of eigenstates, besides \u03c8L (x)\n\nIII.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nLet us now illustrate our approach through specific examples. The point is simply to choose the function f (x) in\nan arbitrary way and then to adjust the important basis function h(x) so that Eqs. (4)\u2013(6) are satisfied. Our recent\nanalysis of Q.E.S. equations in [8] has revealed that the choice\nf (x) = 1 + x2\n\n(13)\n\ncovers many Q.E.S. interactions. This, as well as f \u2032 (x) = 2x, clearly suggests the basis function h(x) = x. From\nEqs. (4)\u2013(6), we get the non vanishing coefficients\nf00 = 1, f20 = 1, f11 = 2, h10 = 1.\n\n(14)\n\nFor the first possibility, corresponding to the constraints in Eq. (11), let us fix L = 1 and choose, without loss of\n(1)\ngenerality, c1 = 1. The potential of Eq. (10) then reads\n4\u03bb21 \u2212 2\u03bb1\n4\u03bb21 \u2212 4\u03bb1\n4\u03bb1 1 m+1\n\u2212\n\u2212\ng x\n1 + x2\n(1 + x2 )2\n1 + x2 m\n1 m\ngm\nx\n4\u03bb1 x\n\u2212\n2\n.\n+\n(1)\n(1)\n2\n(1 + x )(c0 + x)\nc0 + x\n\n1 1 m+n\n1 m\u22121\nV (x) = gm\ngn x\n\u2212 mgm\nx\n+\n\n(15)\n\nA rapid look at the first constraint, corresponding to N = 2 in Eq. (11), shows that the running index m has in fact\nto be restricted to the values m = 0 and m = 1. This first constraint is then a system of eight (nonlinear) equations\n(1) (2) (2)\nfor the eight unknowns g01 , g11 , c0 , c0 , c1 , \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , E2 if, once again, we take advantage of the fact that the eigenstates\n(2)\nare fixed up to a normalization constant, so that c2 can be chosen equal to 1. The second constraint, corresponding\n(1) (3) (3) (3)\nto N = 3, is a system of nine (nonlinear) equations for the nine unknowns g01 , g11 , c0 , c0 , c1 , c2 , \u03bb1 , \u03bb3 , E3 with,\n(3)\nfor the same reason, c3 = 1. Thus there is a total of seventeen equations for thirteen unknowns. Nevertheless, this\nsystem is rather easy to handle and furnishes two sets of solutions. The first set is the one corresponding to the\nwell-known harmonic oscillator potential while the second one is\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3 \u221a\n1\nc, \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = c \u2212 , \u03bb3 = \u2212 c,\n2\n2\n\u221a (1)\n\u221a\n(2)\n(2)\nE2 = 2 c, E3 = \u22128c + 12 c, c0 = 0, c0 = \u22121, c1 = 0,\n\ng01 = 0, g11 =\n\n(3)\n\n(3)\n\nc0 = 0, c1 =\n\n4\n3c\n\n1\n(3)\n,c = 0\n\u22122 2\n\n(16)\n\nwith c being\nc=\n\n(\n\n\u22121 +\n\n\u221a\n\n\"\n\n1\n5 cos\narctan\n3\n\n!#)2\n\u221a\n109\n,\n4\n\n(17)\n\n\f5\ni.e., c = 1.119639.

Thus, our method\nincludes the one described in that reference. Moreover, as we will show in the next Section, it is simpler (see the\nfunction U (x) of Eq. (39) which would be needed to find the potential Eq. (18) and the eigenfunctions Eqs. (19)\u2013(21)).\nFor the second possibility, corresponding to the constraints in Eq. (12), let us fix L = 2, which is the minimal\n(L)\n(L)\nvalue for having at most three eigenstates in this case, together with cL = 1 and c\u0303L = 1. We have not found a\nnew potential with three eigenstates. Only known ones like the harmonic oscillator or its supersymmetric partner [5]\nemerge. We have however found a new potential with two eigenstates. It is given by\nV (x) =\n\nx2\n1\n4 + 2ix\n\u2212 +\n36 6 3(x + i)2\n\n(22)\n\nand the two eigenstates and related eigenvalues are\n\u0012 2\u0013\nx\n, E2 = 0,\n\u03c82 (x) = (3 + 2ix + x )(1 + x ) exp \u2212\n12\n\u0012 2\u0013\nx\n2\n\u03c8\u03032 (x) = (\u22121 + 2ix + x2 ) exp \u2212\n, \u1ebc2 = .\n12\n3\n2\n\n2 \u22121\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\nThus, we have here an example of a complex but PT-symmetric [9] Q.E.S. potential, with real eigenvalues. This\npotential is new compared to the ones already studied through other developments [10].\nTo end this Section, we mention that the potentials Eq. (18) and Eq. (22) could be written as in Eq. (7), implying\nthat, given the potentials, we could have found the eigenfunctions using the algorithm we have described in [8].\nIV.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH THE KULIY-TKACHUK APPROACH\n\nFor completeness, let us briefly recall what the method of Kuliy-Tkachuk is. It is based on a recursive construction\nof supersymmetric partners. Indeed, the initial potential V (x) is required to be written as\nV (x) = WL (x)2 \u2212 WL\u2032 (x).\nIf such a WL (x) does exist, then the ground state and its energy are known\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\n\u03c8L (x) = exp \u2212 WL (x)dx , EL = 0.\n\n(25)\n\n(26)\n\nProvided one can find two other functions WL+1 (x) and WL+2 (x) such that the Ricatti equations\n2\n\u2032\nWk2 (x) + Wk\u2032 (x) + Ek = Wk+1\n(x) \u2212 Wk+1\n(x) + Ek+1 , k = L, L + 1\n\n(27)\n\nare satisfied, two other solutions (respectively associated with EL+1 and EL+2 ) are available. They are given by\n\u0015\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\n\u0014\nd\n(28)\n+ WL (x) exp \u2212 WL+1 (x)dx ,\n\u03c8L+1 (x) = \u2212\ndx\n\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\nd\nd\n\u03c8L+2 (x) = \u2212\n+ WL (x) \u2212\n+ WL+1 (x) exp \u2212 WL+2 (x)dx .\n(29)\ndx\ndx\n\n\f6\nThe main point of the Kuliy-Tkachuk approach is to reduce Eqs. (27) to only one equation\n(L)\n\n(L+1)\n\nW+ (x)W+\n\ni\nh\ni\nd h (L)\n(L+1)\n(L+1)\n(L)\nW+ (x)W+\n(x)\n(x) W+\n(x) \u2212 W+ (x) \u2212\ndx\n(L)\n(L+1)\n+ (EL+2 \u2212 EL+1 ) W+ (x) + EL+1 W+\n(x) = 0\n\n(30)\n\nof the two functions\n(k)\n\nW+ (x) \u2261 Wk (x) + Wk+1 (x), k = L, L + 1.\n\n(31)\n\n(L)\n\nFinally, Eq. (30) can be considered as an algebraic one in terms of W+ (x), for instance, if the function\n(L)\n\n(L+1)\n\nU (x) \u2261 W+ (x)W+\n\n(x)\n\n(32)\n\nis fixed arbitrarily at the start. The whole approach thus relies on an adequate choice of this function U (x). Note\nthat the authors of Ref. [5] have restrained themselves to the context of the functions U (x) such that\nU (x) \u2264 0 if x \u2208 [min(x0 , x\u03030 ), max(x0 , x\u03030 )],\nU (x) > 0 otherwise\n\n(33)\n(34)\n\nwhere x0 and x\u03030 are the two zeroes of U (x) such that\nU \u2032 (min(x0 , x\u03030 )) < 0,\n\nU \u2032 (max(x0 , x\u03030 )) > 0.\n\n(35)\n\nIn [5], these conditions were fixed according to the requirement that none of the functions Wl (x), l = L, L + 1, L + 2\npossesses singularities.\nNow we concentrate on the determination of this U (x) related to the examples developed in the previous Section.\nIn what concerns the potential Eq. (18) and its eigenstates (19)\u2013(21), a comparison with Eqs. (26) and (28)\u2013(29)\ngives rise to the identifications\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(2 c \u2212 1)x 1\nWL (x) = cx \u2212\n\u2212 ,\n(36)\n(1 + x2 )\nx\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(2 c + 1)x 1\n+ ,\n(37)\nWL+1 (x) = cx \u2212\n(1 + x2 )\nx\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2x (14c \u2212 3 c \u2212 15) + (68c + 12 c \u2212 90)x2\n(2 c + 1)x 1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a .\nWL+2 (x) = cx +\n\u2212\n\u2212\n(38)\n(1 + x2 )\nx (34c + 6 c \u2212 45)x4 + (14c \u2212 3 c \u2212 15)x2 \u2212 3 c\nIt is already evident that such functions will lead to a Q.E.S. potential excluded in the Kuliy-Tkachuk approach due\nto the singularity x = 0 in Eqs. (36)\u2013(38). Indeed the corresponding U (x) can be obtained through Eqs. (31)\u2013(32)\nand is\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a 2 2\n(\u2212192c \u2212 39 c + 255)x2 + 2(\u221217c + 3 c + 15)\n\u221a .\n\u221a\n\u221a\nU (x) = 2 cx (x \u2212 1)\n(39)\n(34c + 6 c \u2212 45)x4 + (14c \u2212 3 c \u2212 15)x2 \u2212 3 c\nBy opposition to the U (x) permitted in [5], this one admits one second-order zero point (x = 0) and two ordinary\nzero points (x = \u00b11). Moreover U (x) has no pole and is such that (compare with Eqs. (33)\u2013(35))\nU (x) \u2264 0 if x \u2208 [\u22121, 1],\nU (x) > 0 if x \u2208] \u2212 \u221e, \u22121[ \u222a ]1, +\u221e[,\nU \u2032 (0) = 0, U \u2032 (\u22121) < 0, U \u2032 (1) > 0.\n\n(40)\n(41)\n(42)\n\nLet us also stress the heaviness of the U (x) given in Eq. (39): The least one can say is that it is not natural to think at\nthe start of such a function while the choice of our function f (x) = 1 + x2 is on the other hand quite straightforward.\nThis is the main advantage of our approach: using L = 0 as a starting point in Eq. (8), we could have obtained the\nKuliy-Tkachuk solution of Ref. [5] doing the same type of easy calculations that we have performed here. We would\nhave of course obtained the same results as has been used in that reference, i.e.:\n\u221a \u0001\n\u221a \u0001\n\u221a \u0011 2 \u22123 + 3\n2 \u22123 + 2 3\n3 2 1\u0010\n+\n,\n(43)\n6\u22127 3 \u2212\nV (x) = x +\n4\n2\n1 + x2\n(1 + x2 )2\n\n\f7\n!\n\u221a\n3 2\nexp \u2212\nx , E0 = 0,\n\u03c80 (x) = (1 + x )\n4\n!\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3 2\n2 ( 3\u22121)/2\nx , E1 = 6 \u2212 3 3,\n\u03c82 (x) = x(1 + x )\nexp \u2212\n4\n!\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3 2\n2\n2 ( 3\u22121)/2\n\u03c83 (x) = (1 \u2212 x )(1 + x )\nexp \u2212\nx , E2 = 6 \u2212 2 3.\n4\n\u221a\n2 (3\u2212 3)/2\n\n(44)\n(45)\n(46)\n\nOn the contrary, it is doubtful that the function U (x) of Eq. (39) could have been witnessed from the start, while, in\nour approach, it just consists in starting with L = 1 in Eq. (8). It is also interesting to remark that the potential V (x)\nof [5], and our potential of Eq. (18) have the same type of x-dependence: V (x) = a + bx2 + c/(1 + x2 ) + d/(1 + x2 )2 ,\nand admit three solutions. This shape of the potential is very rich, see e.g [8]. In fact it is even possible (apart from\nthe harmonic oscillator c = d = 0) to find an exactly solvable model, using a = 0, b = 1/4, c = 4, d = \u22128. One may\nwonder why it is not just possible to study the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a potential of this general shape. We have\nshown in Ref. [8] that the constraints are extremely difficult to handle, especially when the number of solutions is\ngrowing.\n(L)\nFor the potential of Eq. (22), the function U (x) simply reduces to W+ (x) as defined in Eq. (31) due to the fact\nthat this potential has two eigenvalues only. We respectively have\nx\n1\n1\n+\n\u2212\n,\n6 x + i x + 3i\nx\n1\n1\n1\nWL+1 (x) =\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n6 x + i x + 3i x + 4i\nWL (x) =\n\n(47)\n(48)\n\nevidently leading to\n(L)\n\nU (x) \u2261 W+ (x) =\n\nx\n1\n\u2212\n.\n3 x + 4i\n\n(49)\n\nSo once again singularities (in the complex plane) arise and the resulting U (x) could not be found following the\nmethod of Ref. [5].\nRemarks concerning the choice of U (x)\nWe have already seen that the choice of U (x) is a non trivial task. We want to show here that the choice is also\nsensitive to small changes of parameters, and that care must be done to extract meaningful solutions, i.e., even if U (x)\nallows to generate a well-behaved potential V (x), the eigenfunctions obtained using the formalism are not physically\nsuitable. We show this starting with the simple choice U (x) = cx2 , with c a constant to be determined. To avoid a\nO(1/x2 ) singularity in the potential, one is forced to adjust the constant c to c = E1 (E2 \u2212 E1 ), with E0 = 0. Choosing\nE1 = 1, E2 = 2, so as to have an equally spaced spectrum, two potentials emerge: either V (x) = (x2 + 10)/4, or\n\u1e7c (x) = (x2 \u2212 2)/4, which are both harmonic oscillator potentials. Because there is only a translation between the\ntwo, one may believe that both are admissible. This is however not the case using the general method of Ref. [5].\nUsing the different functions WL , L = 0, 1, 2 which enter Eqs. (26)\u2013(32), the case which would lead to V (x) implies\nunbounded solutions Eq. (26), Eq. (28) and Eq. (29) at infinity. Only the case which lead to the potential \u1e7c (x) has\nWL -functions which ensure that the eigenfunctions are physical. Moreover, changing minimally the problem leads\noften to the impossibility to solve it. For example, taking U (x) = 3x2 , corresponding with non equally spaced energy\nlevels E0 = 0, E1 = 3, E2 = 4, leads to well-defined potentials, because W0 (x) behaves adequately. It is however\nimpossible to find physically acceptable wave-functions due to singularities and bad behavior at infinity of W1 (x) and\nW2 (x).\nAnother remark concerns the class of functions given in Ref. [8], which is too restrictive. For example, the well-known\n[3] sextic oscillator\nV0 (x) = x6 \u2212 11x2 + 8\n\n(50)\n\nadmitting the three solutions\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u03c80 (x) = (1 + 4x2 + 2x4 ) exp \u2212 x4 , E0 = 0\n4\n\n(51)\n\n\f8\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u03c81 (x) = (2x4 \u2212 3) exp \u2212 x4 , E1 = 8\n4\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u03c82 (x) = (1 \u2212 4x2 + 2x4 ) exp \u2212 x4 , E2 = 16.\n4\n\n(52)\n(53)\n\ncorresponds to\nU (x) =\n\n(2x4 \u2212 3)(2x4 \u2212 1)\n.\nx2\n\n(54)\n\nThis U (x) does not enter the Kuliy and Tkachuk formalism.\nWe have also tried different other choices for U (x), which do not belong to the class of Kuliy and Tkachuk. We\nhave investigated the two simplest deviations of the quadratic choice: U (x) = c(x2 \u2212 a2 ) and U (x) = cx2 (x2 \u2212 a2 ),\nwith both choices a2 > 0 or a2 < 0. The result is that it is possible to find solutions for the first case. These solutions\nare however not physical (they diverge at infinity). In the second case, it is possible to find physically acceptable\nsolutions. However, it is not possible to express them analytically because the functions WL , WL+1 and WL+2 which\nenter Eq. (26) and Eqs. (28)\u2013(29) are not analytically integrable.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have presented a powerful alternative to the method of Kuliy and Tkachuk of Ref. [5]. We\nhave shown that the function U (x) is, even in a case which differs minimally from the one treated in that reference,\ncomplicated and heavy to handle: simple U (x) do not lead to Q.E.S. potential; other U (x) may give a good potential,\nbut not physically relevant solutions. In contradistinction, our method seems straightforward to apply and, by\nconstruction, leads to physical solutions.\n\n[1] V. Singh, S.N. Biswas and K. Datta, Phys. Rev. 18 (1978) 1901.\n[2] A.G.
