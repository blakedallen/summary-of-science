A physically simple\ncalculation of the temperature to which a solid target heats up after\nthe impact of a projectile with mass m and speed v is performed,and\npossibilities for the application of this result in planetology are pointed\nout.1\n\n1\n\nto appear in Serbian Astron.Journal\n\n\f1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nColliding macroscopic bodies exchange momentum. In inellastic collisions,a\npart of the momentum is transformed into heat.\nThe aim of this paper is to analyze to some extent the thermal effects in a\ncollision of solid bodies of different masses, and to estimate the temperature\nto which the more massive of the colliding bodies (the target) heats up.\nIf the temperature of the target rises sufficiently, melting and ultimately\nvaporisation will occur. The melting temperature of a solid can be estimated\nby the so called Lindemann criterion. The value obtained by the Lindemann\ncriterion will be compared with the temperature to which the target heats up\nin a collision. As the temperature to which the target heats up depends on\nthe kinetic energy of the impactor this calculation will provide an estimate\nwhether or not in an impact the target melts,and as a consequence can it be\nanalyzed by applying solid state physics or not.\nIf the mass of the target is sufficiently higher than the mass of the impactor, the impact will produce virtually no change in the momentum of\nthe target, while the impactor will almost certainly be destroyed. The kinetic energy of the impactor will be spent on heating of the target and on\nintroducing changes into its structure.\nThe following section contains the calculation of the temperature to which\na target in a collision heats up in the case of an inellastic collision. The\ncalculation is performed for two cases: for the \"ideal\" case, in which all\nof the kinetic energy of the impactor is converted into heat,and for a more\nrealistic case,in which a part of the kinetic energy is used to form a crack\nin the target. The third part shows how to include the equation of state of\nthe material of the target in the calculation in one particular example,and\nthe last part of the paper points to possible planetological application of the\ncalculation presented in the present paper.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nCALCULATIONS\nThe ideal case\n\nThe specific heat of a solid at low temperature is given by ([3])\nCV =\n\n2\u03c0 2 kB\n(kB T )3\n5 (h\u0304V )3\n1\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere kB is Boltzmann's constant, h\u0304 is Planck's constant divided by 2\u03c0,T\nthe absolute temperature and V the speed of sound waves in the material.\nIt can be shown in solid state physics that\nV =(\n\n\u2202P 1/2\n)\n\u2202\u03c1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere P and \u03c1 denote,respectively, the pressure and density of the material.\nInserting eq.(2) into eq.(1),it follows that\nCV =\n\n2\u03c0 2 kB \u2202P \u22123/2\n(\n)\n(kB T )3\n5 (h\u0304)3 \u2202\u03c1\n\n(3)\n\nHeating up volume V of the material of the target by one degree requires\nthe quantity of energy equal to V CV . The temperature to which this volume\nwill heat up when impacted by an object having mass m and speed v is in\nthe ideal case given by\n1 mv 2\nT0 + (\n) = T1\n(4)\n2 V CV\nwhere T0 denotes the intial temperature of the target. Practically, the volume\nV physically represents the volume of a crater resulting from the impact.\nThe volume is obviously dependent on the shape of the crater. Assume\nthat a crater has the shape of a half of a rotating ellipsoid with distinct\nsemi axes,denoted by a,b and c. Physically,a and b are the semi axes of\nthe \"opening\" of the crater,and c denotes its depth. The volume is V =\n(2/3)\u03c0abc,which leads to the final expression for the temperature to which\nthis volume of the target heats up as a result of the impact\nT1 = T0 +\n\n15 mv 2 (h\u0304V )3\n(kB T0 )\u22123\n3\n8\u03c0 kB\nabc\n\n(5)\n\nInserting eq.(2) into eq.(5), it finally follows that\nT1 = T0 +\n\n2 3 \u2202P 3/2\n15 mv h\u0304 ( \u2202\u03c1 )\n(kB T0 )\u22123\n8\u03c0 3 kB\nabc\n\n(6)\n\nIs this heating sufficient or not to lead to melting and even vaporisation\nof the material of the target? This can be detemined by applying the so\ncalled Lindemann criterion which states that ([2])\nTm = Tm0 (\n\n\u03c10 2/3\n) exp(2\u03b30 (1 \u2212 (\u03c10 /\u03c1)))\n\u03c1\n2\n\n(7)\n\n\fIn this expression Tm denotes the melting temperature of a material at mass\ndensity \u03c1, Tm0 is the melting temperature at density \u03c10 .The symbol \u03b30 denotes the value of the Gruneisen parameter of the material at density \u03c10 .The\nGruneisen parameter is defined as\n\u03b3=\n\n\u03b1KT\nCV \u03c1\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the thermal expansion coefficient and KT the isothermal bulk\nmodulus of the material. Comparing eqs.(6) and (7) it follows that T1 \u2264 Tm\nif\n\u03c10 2/3\n4\u03c0 3\nEk \u2202P 3/2 3\n(\n) h\u0304 (kB T0 )\u22123 \u2264\n) \u00d7\n3 Tm0 (\nabc \u2202\u03c1\n\u03c1\n15h\u0304\nT0\nexp(2\u03b30 (1 \u2212 (\u03c10 /\u03c1))) \u00d7 [1 \u2212\nTm0\n\u03c10 \u22122/3\n\u00d7( )\nexp(\u22122\u03b30 (1 \u2212 (\u03c10 /\u03c1))]\n\u03c1\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Ek denotes the kinetic energy of the impactor in the moment of impact.\nIn practical terms,the fulfillement of this condition means that as a consequence of an impact,the target heats up at the point of impact, but does\nnot melt. A further implication is that such an impact can be analyzed by\ndepends\nsolid state physics. The analytical expression of the derivative \u2202P\n\u2202\u03c1\non the form of the equation of state of the material of the target.\n\n2.2\n\nThe \"real\" case\n\nIf the relative velocity of two colliding solid bodies is high enough,and if\nthe material strength of the target is small enough,it can be expected that a\nfracture will occur in the target as a consequence of the collision. A standard\nresult for the stress necessary for the occurence of a fracture is given by (for\nexample,[7])\n1 E\u03c7\u03c4 1/2\n\u03c3C = (\n)\n(10)\n2 r0 a\nwhere E is Young's modulus of the material,\u03c7 is the surface energy,\u03c4 the\nradius of curvature of the crack,r0 the interatomic spacing at which the stress\nbecomes zero and a denotes the length of the crack. A simple analysis shows\nthat \u03c3C has the dimensions of pressure,which means that the stress multiplied\nby a volume has the dimensions of energy.\n3\n\n\fThis means that when a fracture forms in a target as a result of the\nimpact the energy ballance has the following form:\n1 2\nmv \u2212 \u03c3C V = CV V (T1 \u2212 T0 )\n2\n\n(11)\n\nIt follows that in this case the target heats up to a temperature given by\nT1 = T0 +\n\n1\nEk\n\u00d7(\n\u2212 \u03c3C )\nCV\nV\n\n(12)\n\nInserting eqs.(2),(3) and the expression for the volume into eq.(12), simple\nalgebra could give the result for the temperature T1 to which the target heats\nup.\nA physically more interesting approach to the same problem is given\nby dynamic quantized fracture mechanics (DQF M for short) (for example\n[5]). The basic difference between DQF M and the usual approach used in\nmaterial science is that DQF M introduces geometry in studies of scaling\nlaws in material science (for example [1]). Considering that the occurence of\na fracture in a material is a sign of its failure, it can be shown in DQF M\nthat the stress necessary for the occurence of a failure is given by ([5]):\n\u03c3f = KIc [\n\n1 + ( \u03c12q0 )\n\u03c0(l0 + (q/2))\n\n]1/2\n\n(13)\n\nwhere KIc denotes the fracture toughness,\u03c10 is the radius of the crack of\nlength l0 and q is the length of the so called fracture quantum. In this case\nthe energy balance is determined by eq.(11), with \u03c3f instead of \u03c3C , and the\ntemperature to which the target heats up is given by eq.(12) with the same\nreplacement.\nThe final result is\n1\n3Ek\n3h\u03043 \u2202P 3/2\n(\n)\n[(\n)\u2212\nT1 = T0 +\n3\n2kB \u2202\u03c1\n(kB T0 ) 2\u03c0abc\n1 + ( \u03c12q0 ) 1/2\nKIc [\n] ]\n\u03c0(l0 + (q/2))\n\n(14)\n\nIn this way we have obtained an expression for the temperature to which a\ntarget heats up after the impact in the case in which a fracture forms in it.\nDoes it or does it not melt as a result of the impact can again be determined\n4\n\n\fby comparing T1 with the result of Lindemann's criterion, expressed by eq.(7).\nIt turns out that the condition for \"non-melting\" is given by\nEk\n\u03c10\n\u2212 \u03c3f \u2264 CV Tm0 ( )2/3 exp(2\u03b30 (1 \u2212 (\u03c10 /\u03c1)))\nV\n\u03c1\n\u03c10\nT0\n\u00d7 ( )\u22122/3 exp(\u22122\u03b30 (1 \u2212 (\u03c10 /\u03c1))]\n\u00d7[1 \u2212\nTm0\n\u03c1\n\n3\n\n(15)\n\nThe influence of the equation of state\n\nSeveral equations in the preceeding section contain the derivative \u2202P\n, which\n\u2202\u03c1\nimplies that their application demands the knowledge of the equation of\nstate (EOS) of the material of the target. Generally speaking,the EOS is an\nequation of the form P = f (\u03c1, T ) where all the symbols have their standard\nmeanings,and f is some function. The choice of the EOS appropriate for\nany given material is a complex task.\nAs an example, in the following the so called Birch-Murnaghan EOS will\nbe used.

The symbols V0 and V denote the volume of a\nspecimen under consideration at the initial value of the pressure P0 and at\nsome arbitrary value P .

The main results,expressing the temperature to which a massive target heats up as a\nresult of the impact of a projectile of smaller mass are given by eqs.(6) and\n(16). The calculations have been performed for two distinct cases: when the\nimpact has no consequences on the structure of the target,and when it is so\nstrong that a fracture occurs in the body of the target.\nThere is a distinct difference in the behaviour of the results obtained in\nthe two cases. In what we have called \"the ideal case\", the temperature of the\ntarget always changes as a result of the impact,as \u2202P/\u2202\u03c1 is always different\nfrom zero. No heating effect would occur only in the special case \u2202P/\u2202\u03c1 = 0\nwhich is physically unrealistic, because a material in which pressure and\ndensity are not related in some way does not exist.\nAn interesting result has been obtained in the \"real case\". Namely, using\nstadard material science would have given a result which would have taken\ninto account only the parameters of the material of the target. Instead of\nsuch an approach, we have used the DQF M approach, which takes into\nconsideration the material parameters, but also the geometry of the problem.\nNote that the result contains the length and radius of the crack,as well as\nthe length of the fracture quantum.\nA possible extension of the calculations discussed here could be the inclusion of the presence of magnetic fields. Recent experiments in material science\n6\n\n\fhave shown that the presence of low magnetic fields can lead to strenghtening\nof materials,[4]. This means that their failure strength is increased.\nIn this case the heating effect does not always occur. It is clear that for\nthe particular value of the kinetic energy of the impactor, given by\nEk = \u03c3f V\n\n(20)\n\nT1 = T0 in eq.(12),which means that in that case the target does not heat up\nas a consequence of the impact. Such a result may seem strange, but it is\na consequence of the partition of the kinetic energy of the impactor on the\nheating of the target and formation of a fracture in it.\nResults of this paper have obvious applications in planetary science. It is\nknown that impacts and collisions between various bodies have been occuring\nthroughout the history of our planetary system. One of the consequences of\nthese events are the impact craters on the Earth,Moon, Mars,(at least) some\nasteroids (for example on Eros,see [8]) and satellites. It is expectable that\nthe spots on the surfaces of these objects in which impacts occur get heated.\nThe question which arises is whether or not such events can be analyzed by\nusing solid state physics. Namely, if the material of the target(s) heats up\nbut does not melt or vaporize, an impact can be analyzed by using laws of\nsolid state physics. However,if melting occurs,solid state physics is applicable\nonly up to the temperature of melting. Details will be discussed elsewhere.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThis paper was prepared within the research project 174031 financed by the\nMinistry of Education and Science of Serbia.
