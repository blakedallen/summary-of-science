R\u00f6llig,\ne-mail: roellig@ph1.uni-koeln.de\n\u22c6\nFounded by merging of the Sternwarte, Radioastronomisches\nInstitut and Institut f\u00fcr Astrophysik und Extraterrestrische Forschung\n\nUnderstanding the feedback between star formation and the interstellar medium (ISM) is important in order to understand the\nprocess of star formation (see Zinnecker & Yorke 2007, and\n\n\f2\n\nR\u00f6llig et al.: Photon Dominated Regions in NGC 3603\n\npredict a limb brightening of the [CI] emission (R\u00f6llig et al.\n2006). In this work we analyze the distribution of atomic\ncarbon and warm CO in the NGC 3603 star forming region\nand use LTE approximations and an escape probability model\n(Stutzki & Winnewisser 1985) to derive the excitation conditions of the gas as well as gas abundances. We refrain from applying more detailed models like the KOSMA-\u03c4 PDR model\n(St\u00f6rzer et al. 1996; R\u00f6llig et al. 2006; Cubick et al. 2008).\nRecent Herschel/HIFI observations of massive star forming regions provide additional strict constraints on the PDR modeling\nof these regions, resulting in significantly altered predictions of\nthe local physical and structural conditions (Ossenkopf et al.\n2010; Dedes et al. 2010). Hence, we postpone all attempts of\nPDR modeling in NGC 3603 until the region has been observed\nwith Herschel in the framework of the Herschel Guaranteed\nTime Key Project Warm And Dense ISM.\n\nFig. 1. 8 \u03bcm Spitzer/IRAC band (in MJy/sr) overlayed with\nCO 4\u20133 NANTEN2 observations presented in this paper. The\nposition of the cluster is marked by a star. The boxes mark the\npositions of the pillar heads. The crosses mark the positions\nalong the cuts into MM1 and MM2. IRAC pixel size is 1.2\".\nThe position (0,0) corresponds to R.A.(J2000.0)=11h15m 08.s 85,\nDec.(J2000.0)=\u221261\u25e616\u2032 50.\u2032\u2032 0.\nreferences therein). The physical and chemical properties of\nstars are the heritage of their parental clouds. Stars are born\nfrom interstellar gas and release metal-enriched material to the\nISM when they die. Radiation from the stars is the prime heating source for gas and dust in nearby molecular clouds and\nmay trigger velocity and density fluctuations, that stimulate\nfurther star formation. To understand the formation of these\nnext generation stars, it is important to understand how the previous generation interacts with its parental clouds (Dale et al.\n2005). The energy incident on the clouds in the form of stellar\nfar ultraviolet (FUV: 6 eV\u2264 h\u03bd \u2264 13.6 eV) radiation is countered by cooling continuum radiation plus emission of atomic\nfine-structure lines ([CII] 158 \u03bcm, [CI] 370 \u03bcm, 610 \u03bcm, and\n[OI]63 \u03bcm, 145 \u03bcm) and by molecular rotational lines (CO,\nH2 O, OH, etc.). The cooling emission carries the imprint of\nthe local physical and chemical conditions and can be used to\ninfer the type of environment conducive to maintaining star\nformation. On their way into a molecular cloud FUV photons are absorbed, and a depth-dependant chemical balance is\nestablished. Models of these so-called photon dominated regions (PDRs; see references in Hollenbach & Tielens 1999;\nR\u00f6llig et al. 2007) typically predict a stratification of species\nlike H/H2 , C+ /C/CO, and others. This stratification is found to\nbe independent of the shape of the PDR (Gorti & Hollenbach\n2002). However, observations often reveal [CI] emission coincident with that of CO (Tatematsu et al. 1999; Ikeda et al. 2002;\nMookerjea et al. 2006; Sakai et al. 2006; Kramer et al. 2008;\nSun et al. 2008). Plane-parallel models cannot explain this behavior unless full face-on orientation is assumed. Spherical\nmodels under isotropic illumination show well-correlated [CI]\nand CO emission for low density clouds (n . 104 cm \u22123 ) but\n\n2. The NGC 3603 star forming region\nNGC 3603 is located in the Carina spiral arm (l \u2248 291.6\u25e6, b \u2248\n\u22120.5\u25e6 ) at a distance of approximately 7-8 kpc (see discussion in Melena et al. 2008). It is one of the most luminous\n(Lbol > 107 L\u2299 ), optically visible HII regions in the Galaxy,\nwith the massive OB cluster NGC 3603 YC (Young Cluster)\nas a power source (Goss & Radhakrishnan 1969). The compact core of the cluster was designated HD 97950 due to\nits star-like appearance. As a comparison, NGC 3603 is 100\ntimes more luminous than the Trapezium cluster in Orion.\nThis young cluster can be considered one of the few Galactic\nstarburst clusters, which are essential for the understanding\nof extragalactic star bursts. With a dynamic stellar cluster\nmass of 17600\u00b13800 M\u2299 (Rochau et al. 2010) residing in\na cloud of total gas mass of 4 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 (Grabelsky et al.\n1988), it is the most compact Galactic star-forming complex outside the Galactic center region (Stolte et al. 2004).\nIn a number of recent studies, the stellar cluster and\nthe surrounding HII region has been investigated thoroughly (Pandey et al. 2000; Sung & Bessell 2004; Stolte et al.\n2006; Lebouteiller et al. 2007, 2008; Harayama et al. 2008;\nN\u00fcrnberger 2008; Crowther et al. 2010). To the south of the\ncluster we find a giant molecular cloud (see Figure 1). The\nintensive radiation and stellar winds from the cluster shape\nlarge gaseous pillars at the edge of the cloud (Brandner et al.\n2000). CS observations by N\u00fcrnberger et al. (2002) show that\nthe molecular gas also extends much further to the north (> 10\u2032 )\nand to the south, hosting numerous massive molecular clumps\nwhich may be future sites of star formation. A number of\nprominent IR sources have been found so far (Frogel et al.\n1977; N\u00fcrnberger 2008; N\u00fcrnberger et al. 2010) as well as proplyd like objects (M\u00fccke et al. 2002). Recent AKARI observations of NGC 3603 have been presented by Okada et al. (2010)\nshowing that the [CII] 158 \u03bcm emission is widely distributed\nand that the [OIII] 88 \u03bcm emission follows the MIR, FIR, and\nradio continuum emission.\n\n\fR\u00f6llig et al.: Photon Dominated Regions in NGC 3603\n\n3. Observations\nWe used the NANTEN2-4m antenna at 4865m altitude\nin Pampa la Bola in northern Chile to map the central\n2\u2032 \u00d7 2\u2032 region of NGC 3603. Our reference position is\nR.A.(J2000.0)=11h15m 08.s 85,\nDec.(J2000.0)=\u221261\u25e616\u2032 50.\u2032\u2032 0,\n\u2032\u2032\n73 south-east of the central OB cluster NGC 3603 YC at\nR.A.(J2000.0)=11h15m 07.s 26, Dec.(J2000.0)=\u221261\u25e615\u2032 37.\u2032\u2032 48.\nWe observed the rotational transitions of 12 CO J=4\u20133\n(461.0408 GHz) and J=7\u20136 (806.6517 GHz) and the two\nfine-structure transitions of atomic carbon [C I], 3 P1 \u20133 P0\n(492.1607 GHz) and 3 P2 \u20133 P1 (809.3446 GHz) (henceforth 1\u20130\nand 2\u20131), between September and November 2006 with a dualchannel 460/810 GHz receiver. The exact line frequencies were\ntaken from the Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy\nCDMS (M\u00fcller et al. 2005, 2001). Double sideband (DSB)\nreceiver temperatures were \u2248 250 K in the lower frequency\nchannel and \u2248 750 K in the upper channel. The intermediate\nfrequencies (IF) are 4 GHz and 1.5 GHz, respectively. The latter IF allows simultaneous observations of the CO 7\u20136 line in\nthe lower sideband and the [C I] 2\u20131 line in the upper sideband.\nThese two lines were observed simultaneously with one of the\ntwo lower lines in the 460 GHz channel. As backends, we used\ntwo acousto optical spectrometers (AOS) with bandwidths of\n1 GHz. The channel spacing was 0.37 km s\u22121 at 460 GHz and\n0.21 km s\u22121 at 806 GHz. The pointing accuracy was checked\nregularly on Jupiter, IRC+10216, and IRc2 in OrionA. The\napplied corrections were always <20\u2032\u2032 and usually < 10\u2032\u2032 . To\ndetermine the atmospheric transmission, we measured the\natmospheric emission at the reference position. Spectra of the\ntwo frequency bands were calibrated separately, and sideband\nimbalances were corrected using the atmospheric model atm\n(Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves, cf. Pardo et al.\n2001). Observations were taken on-the-fly (OTF), scanning in\nright ascension at a speed of 2.5\u2032\u2032 /sec and sampling every 10\u2032\u2032 .\nThe reference position was observed at the beginning of each\nOTF scanning line.\nThe half power beam widths (HPBW) deconvolved from\nthe observed full widths at half maximum (FWHM) are\n38.0\u2032\u2032 and 26.5\u2032\u2032 in the lower and upper receiver bands, respectively. Beam efficiencies Beff are 50% and 45%, respectively\n(Simon et al. 2007; Kramer et al. 2008). The median RMS\nacross the map is 1.74, 1.53, 0.70, and 1.25 K for CO 4\u20133,\n7\u20136, [C I] 1\u20130, and 2\u20131 respectively. The forward efficiency,\nFeff = 86% in both bands, was determined from sky-dips.\nThe raw data were calibrated to antenna temperatures T A\u2217 and\nscaled to main beam temperatures Tmb with the factor Feff /Beff .\nWe present all data in units of Tmb . Fifth order polynomial\nbaselines were subtracted from all spectra. Observations of the\natomic carbon lines are very challenging and require many OTF\ncoverages to achieve a signal to noise (S/N) ratio above 3 \u03c3.\n\n4. Data\n4.1. Dust and PAHs\nIn Fig.1, we show a map of integrated CO 4\u20133 intensities from\nNANTEN2 overlayed to an 8 \u03bcm image taken with the Infrared\n\n3\n\nArray Camera (IRAC) on board the Spitzer space telescope1 .\nThe position of the OB cluster is marked by a star. The image shows prominent molecular clumps southwest and southeast of the cluster position. Following N\u00fcrnberger et al. (2002),\nwe refer to them as MM1 and MM2, respectively. The IRAC\nimage shows the sharp PDR interfaces between the HII region and the molecular cloud. The positions of these interfaces\nmatch the pillar-like structures visible in HST and VLT images (Brandner et al. 2000). Note that these pillars are much\nsmaller than the molecular clouds from which they protrude.\nWe also note a dusty filament, which connects MM1 and MM2\nin a large arc 1.5' to 2' south of the western pillar head. This\nfilament is not visible in CO or [CI] emission. The strong\n8 \u03bcm emission (> 104 MJy/sr) includes strong PAH emission\n(7.6,7.8, and 8.6 \u03bcm). The 8 \u03bcm band is an excellent tracer of\nthe PDR interface. For a detailed analysis of the emission by\nPAH's and very small grains see Lebouteiller et al. (2007).\n\n4.2. NANTEN2 observations\n4.2.1. Maps of integrated intensity\nFig. 2 shows maps of integrated CO 4\u20133, 7\u20136, [C I] 1\u20130, and\n2\u20131 emission integrated over a velocity range from 4 to\n26 km s\u22121 . The two molecular clumps MM1 and MM2 are\nvisible: MM1 to the southwest of the OB cluster and MM2\nto the southeast. The peak intensities are 267 K*km s\u22121 for\nCO 4\u20133, 121 K*km s\u22121 for CO 7\u20136, 28 K*km s\u22121 for [C I] 1\u20130,\nand 30 K*km s\u22121 for [C I] 2\u20131.\nMM2 is very prominent in all 4 observed transitions while\nMM1 is weaker in the fine structure transitions.\nBoth CO maps mark the transition from the HII region\nto the molecular cloud. MM1 is presumably smaller than our\nbeam size (N\u00fcrnberger et al. 2002), hence it is not possible to\ninfer detailed structure information from the maps.\nThe observed intensity distributions of the [C I] fine structure transitions are more extended with a lower contrast in comparison to the intensity distributions of the CO rotational line\ntransitions. The peak positions of [CI] are slightly shifted away\nfrom the cluster compared to CO. However, the S/N of both\n[C I] transitions is too low to allow further conclusions. MM1\ncan be identified in both CO maps. In [C I] a diffuse emission\nis visible without a clear distinction between clump center and\nits more diffuse environment. The MM2 peak positions of both\nCO maps match within the pointing accuracy. The same is true\nfor both [C I] maps. Both [C I] peaks are shifted away from the\nOB cluster with respect to CO. However, we note a good spatial\ncorrelation between the CO and [C I] emission as all peaks coincide within a beam radius. We do not see any C-CO layering\nas expected from simple edge-on, plane-parallel PDR scenarios. It is possible to explain coincident [C I] and CO emission\nwith a face-on configuration, but the visible pillar structures in\nthe HST observations and the very sharp interface visible in the\n1\n\nPost-BCD data were retrieved from the Spitzer archive (URL\nhttp://archive.spitzer.caltech.edu/). Because of strong saturation effects, we chose the short exposure data.\n\n\f4\n\nR\u00f6llig et al.: Photon Dominated Regions in NGC 3603\n\nR\nTable 1.

From the channel\nmaps, it is evident that the emission towards MM1 shows a\nsmaller kinematic range than in MM2. MM1 is not observable\nat velocities higher than 16 km s\u22121 , while the emission in MM2\nextends up to 21 km s\u22121 . At larger velocities, the emission gradually shifts to the southwest. A similar kinematic behavior is\nalso visible from CS (3-2) observations by N\u00fcrnberger et al.\n(2002). Their results also show a velocity drift for MM1 with\ndistance from the OB cluster, possibly indicating a placement\nof MM1 in front of the cluster. In the appendix we show the\nvelocity channel maps of the remaining 3 transitions.\n\nFig. 2. Velocity integrated maps (200\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 200\u2032\u2032 ) of CO 4\u20133,\n7\u20136, [C I] 1\u20130, and 2\u20131 smoothed to a common angular resolution of 38\u2032\u2032 (1.3-1.5 pc at 7-8 kpc), and integrated over\na velocity range from 4 to 26 km s\u22121 .

Spectra along a cut through the region\nTo study the transition from the ionized to the molecular gas,\nwe selected two cuts from the OB cluster to the peak positions\nof MM1 and MM2. The positions along the cut are 22\u2032\u2032 apart\nand marked in Fig. 2.

R74 is remarkably constant across\nboth clouds. We find an excitation temperature slightly above\n50 K for both clouds. First, this confirms that both clouds have\ncomparable excitation conditions despite their different appearance. Second, they seem not to be composed of hot, unresolved\nclumps which would result in a much higher excitation temperature derived from R74 . Instead the gas appears to be more\nsmoothly distributed and excited.\n\nFig. 4. Spectra along two cuts connecting the OB cluster and\nthe centre of MM1 (bottom) and MM2 (top). The CI spectra\nappear to show sinusoidal standing waves, however a detailed\nanalysis shows no consistent standing wave pattern. These\nbaseline variations are thus attributed to instabilities of the system and/or the atmosphere during the measurements. All data\nare at a common resolution of 38\u2032\u2032 and on the main beam temperature scale.\n\nthe molecular clumps. The spectra at the positions 30\u2032\u2032 /-10\u2032\u2032 ,\n40\u2032\u2032 /-30\u2032\u2032 , and 50\u2032\u2032 /-50\u2032\u2032 do not show simple Gaussian line profiles. N\u00fcrnberger et al. (2002) observed similar line profiles in\ntheir CS 3\u20132 and 2\u20131 observations of MM2. They used two\nGaussian components separated by 3 km s\u22121 to fit the emission\nprofiles. Our analysis showed that it is not possible to use a similar two component Gaussian fit to reproduce our observations\nat all positions. We derived the first three moments of the spectral line, i.e., integrated intensity, mean velocity, and FWHM,\nover the channels in the range v = 6 \u2212 22 km s\u22121 . The derived moments are given in Table 1. At the offsets -10\u2032\u2032 /70\u2032\u2032 and\n0\u2032\u2032 /50\u2032\u2032 we don't find sufficient emission to derive significant\nvalues.\n\n4.3. Analysis\n4.3.1. LTE \u2013 Column densities and temperatures\nIn Table 2 we give the velocity integrated line ratios R74\n(I76 /I43 ), R21 (I21 /I10 ) and R14 (I10 /I43 ) for all positions along\nthe two cuts. We compute the LTE temperatures using the optically thick CO 4\u20133 emission assuming a beam filling of 1 and\nobtain temperatures of 42 K for the peak position in MM2 and\n24 K for MM1. This is roughly consistent with estimates from\nthe [C I] line ratio. R21 is a sensitive function of the [C I] excitation temperature. In the optically thin limit and assuming\nLTE, T ex = 38.3 K/ ln[2.11/R21]. In MM2 we find ratios between 0.8 and 1.1 which correspond to temperatures between\n40 and 60 K. For MM1 the [C I] line ratio gives a temperature\nestimate of 42 K, higher than the estimate derived from the CO\n4-3 emission. The difference can be explained by beam dilution effects since MM1 is not resolved within the NANTEN2\nbeam. However, the atomic carbon emission is heavily affected\nby noise. Another possibility is to use the LTE ratio of the two\n\nThe atomic carbon column density was derived under the\nassumption of LTE and optically thin [C I] emission. To derive the total H2 column densities we use the integrated intensity of C18 O 2\u20131 as presented in N\u00fcrnberger et al. (2002).\nAssuming optically thin emission, an isotope ratio of 500 and\nCO:H2 =8\u00d710\u22125 (Frerking et al. 1982), i.e., an assumed ratio of\nC18 O/H2 =2\u00d710\u22127, we compute the column densities along the\ntwo cuts. The results are summarized in Table 2. For MM1,\nwe find a total column density of 1.5\u00d71022 cm\u22122 ; for MM2,\nN = 2...5 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 . We find that the relative abundance of\natomic carbon NC /Ntot drops towards the peak positions with\nvalues of 10\u22125 (MM1) and 8 \u2212 19 \u00d7 10\u22126 (MM2), and increases at positions towards as well as away from the OB cluster. Even though the spatial resolution of our maps is rather\ncoarse, this could be an indication for a C/CO stratification, because in this case we would expect limb brightened [CI] emission. The gas pressure within MM1 and MM2 (assuming a density of 104 cm\u22123 ) is about 10-30% of the pressure in the HII region (Shaver & Goss 1970). Hence, the interface region is compressed and driven against the molecular cloud, visible, e.g., in\nthe pillars protruding from MM1 and MM2. From the total column density we can estimate the total mass per beam. The results are given in Table 2. We also derived virial mass estimates\nacross the cuts assuming a density of 104 cm\u22123 and kinetic temperatures of 50 K (the densities are in agreement with the calculations from section 4.3.3). The virial masses agree very well\nwith the LTE masses and are much larger than the Jeans mass\nof the material of 87 M\u2299. This means, the gas is gravitationally\nbound and not transient. We expect that the strong HII pressure and the gravitational instability causes strong fragmentation and cloud collapse. N\u00fcrnberger et al. (2002) derived a star\nformation efficiency of \u2265 30% and a mean star formation rate\nof 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 /yr. Embedded IR sources have already been\nidentified (Frogel et al. 1977) along the outskirts of the molecular clouds and particularly at the base of the pillar like structures at the edge of MM2 (N\u00fcrnberger 2008; N\u00fcrnberger et al.\n2010).\n\n4.3.2. Dust Temperatures and FUV intensities\nTo estimate the total FUV flux, we consider the total luminosities of the most massive O stars in the central OB cluster.\nRecently, Melena et al. (2008) published an updated census of\nthe massive star content of NGC 3603. The most massive members of the OB cluster are 3 WNL stars, 14 O3( and 3.5) stars\n(III+V) and at least 20 late O-type stars. They produce the FUV\nflux that dominates the heating of the PDRs and the molecular\nclouds.

This is a lower limit since the\nspectral classes for more than 10 cluster members remains unknown. Depending on the distance from the cluster center d,\n2\nPauldrach et al. (1998) showed in model calculations that for effective temperatures below 45000 K, the ratio of FUV to EUV photon\nrates is considerably higher than the ratio derived for pure blackbody\nspectra (see also Brandner et al. 2000). This is because EUV photons\nare absorbed in the ionization front. We neglect this effect.\n\nin units of pc, the FUV flux is \u03c7 = 9.4 \u00d7 104 d\u22122 in units of\nthe Draine field. At a distance of 7-8 kpc, one parsec corresponds to angular distances of 26-29\u2032\u2032 , i.e., somewhat smaller\nthan the projected distance between the cluster center and the\nedge of MM2 as seen for example in Fig. 1 (\u2248 46\u2032\u2032 ). If we assume that the cluster and the molecular cloud are situated in the\nsame plane, the FUV field at the peak position in MM2 drops\nto \u03c7 \u2248 5000 \u2212 6600. This is of the same order as the flux at\nthe MM2-peak derived from the IRAS data. If the clumps are\ndisplaced from the plane of the OB cluster, or if the distance to\nthe complex is different, the derived \u03c7 changes. Uncertainties\nin the in-plane displacement of \u00b1 4 pc and in the distance (7-8\nkpc) lead to \u03c7 = 2400 \u2212 6600.\nWe use IRAS data to derive dust temperatures and the FUV\ncontinuum in the observed region. Enhanced resolution images\nof \u223c 1\u2032 resolution were created using the maximum correlation\n\n\fR\u00f6llig et al.: Photon Dominated Regions in NGC 3603\n\nmethod (Aumann et al. 1990). We estimate dust temperatures\nfrom the ratio of HIRES 60 \u03bcm and 100 \u03bcm data, assuming\na dust spectral index of emissivity of 1.5. We obtained high\nresolution (HIRES) 60 and 100 \u03bcm images (2\u25e6 \u00d72\u25e6 ) from the\nIPAC data center3 . Along the two cuts, we find almost constant\ndust temperatures of 35 K. This value is very close to the dust\ntemperature of 37 K derived from MSX data by Wang & Chen\n(2010). Again, comparison with the higher resolution Spitzer\nmaps shows that the warm dust is not distributed homogeneously. We conclude that the HIRES data are, therefore, affected by beam filling.\nFollowing Nakagawa et al. (1998), we combined 60 and\n100\u03bcm data to create a map of far-infrared intensities between\n42.5 \u03bcm and 122.5 \u03bcm (Helou et al. 1988). Under the assumption that all FUV energy absorbed by the grains is re-radiated\nin the far-infrared (FIR), we compute the FUV fluxes (\u03c7) from\nthe emergent FIR intensities (cf. Kramer et al. 2005) IFIR , using \u03c7/\u03c70 = 4\u03c0 IFIR , with \u03c70 = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 (Draine\n1978). The resulting map of the FUV continuum is shown\nin the left panel of Fig. 5. Overlayed as thin contours is the\nNANTEN2 CO 4\u20133 map. At the peak position of MM1, we\nfind FUV fields of \u03c7 = 3460. Along the cut in MM2, we find\nthat \u03c7 gradually increases from 3350 at the position of the OB\ncluster to 5230 at the peak position. Due to the low spatial resolution of the HIRES data, these values are lower limits since\nbeam dilution effects are not negligible.\nOne would expect a decrease of FUV with growing distance from the cluster. However, such a decrease is not seen,\nFig. 5 shows the opposite. This is because the method of deriving FUV intensities from IRAS data is not working for too\nsmall dust column densities because then UV radiation can not\nbe effectively transformed to IR. Consequently, it would be best\nto exclude these parts from the further analysis. In our case, this\nis impossible due to the large beam. HIRES beam sizes vary\nfrom \u223c35\u2032\u2032 to over 120\u2032\u2032 across the maps, hence the FUV values\nin Fig. 5 are considerably beam diluted. In the right panel in\nFig. 5, we overlayed the FUV fields derived from the HIRES\ndata on 5.8\u03bcm Spitzer/IRAC observations of NGC 3603 to illustrate the beam filling effect: 60 and 100\u03bcm emission can\nonly be measured if dust is present at all. The Spitzer map\nshows no dust emission between the interface and the cluster. The HIRES beam size at the cluster position is almost circular with a FWHM of \u223c 35\u2032\u2032 . Hence, a contribution to the\nIRAS/HIRES fluxes at the cluster position can only come from\nthe interface regions of MM1 and MM2. If 60/100\u03bcm emission\ncould be measured at 1-2\u2032\u2032 resolution, one could not determine\nthe FUV field towards the cluster and would observe a sharp\ninterface between the H II region and the clumps. Instead we\nsee no zero FUV intensity at the cluster and a gradual increase\nup to the peak 80\u2032\u2032 behind the interface. This is further illustrated in the left panel in Fig. 5 where we additionally overlayed\nSpitzer/IRAC 5.8\u03bcm emission smoothed to the best HIRES resolution of 35\u2032\u2032 . At this resolution, up to 50% of the total flux is\nsmeared across the H II region.\nAt the MM2-peak, the HIRES beam is almost fully filled\nand the FUV fluxes are consistent with the assumption that the\n\nmolecular cloud and the cluster lies in almost the same plane of\nthe sky. This also supports the assumption that the FUV irradiation of the OB cluster created the pillars seen in the HST/VLT\nimages.\nThe derived FUV fluxes can be used to estimate the ratio\nICII /IFUV , i.e. the fraction of FUV energy that is re-emitted in\nthe the [CII] 158 \u03bcm cooling line. We retrieved the [CII] spectrum4 from the ISO data archive5 and compute an integrated\nintensity of 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 sr\u22121 . Most of the FUV energy that irradiates the cloud is re-radiated in the continuum,\nbut a small fraction is re-emitted in cooling lines, such as the\n[CII] 158\u03bcm line. Applying the FUV flux derived from the\nHIRES data, we estimate ICII /IFUV \u2248 0.2..0.3%. This is consistent with similar results from regions of active star formation, e.g., nuclear regions of galaxies, where approximately 0.1\nto 1 % of the total FUV input is re-radiated in the [CII] line\n(Stacey et al. 1991). However, this remains a rough estimate\nbecause of the large beam sizes involved.\nConsidering the similar FUV estimates from stellar luminosities and from the FIR data, we conclude that the FUV flux\nilluminating the molecular clumps MM1 and MM2 is 30006000 in units of the Draine field. Approximately 0.2 to 0.3% of\nthe total FUV energy is re-emitted in the [CII] 158\u03bcm cooling\nline.\n\n4.3.3. Escape Probability \u2013 density and\ntemperatures\nWe performed escape probability (EP) calculations\n(Stutzki & Winnewisser 1985) to derive local gas densities, column densities, and gas temperatures from the observed\nline ratios (R74 ,R21 ,R14 , and IC18 O2\u22121 /I43 ). The model assumes\na finite, spherical cloud geometry. We fitted the column\ndensities of 12 CO and C independently. From the absolute\nCO 4\u20133 intensities we derived a filling factor Iobs / Imod . The\ntotal H2 column densities and masses have been calculated\nusing CO:H2 =8 \u00d7 10\u22125 . The results are shown in Table 3.\nFor MM2, the temperatures from the EP calculations\nagree within 25% with the LTE temperatures for the positions\n30\u2032\u2032 /-10\u2032\u2032 , 40\u2032\u2032 /-30\u2032\u2032 , and 50\u2032\u2032 /-50\u2032\u2032 . Masses and column densities are comparable with results from the LTE calculations. The\nfilling factor is roughly 0.3-0.6 across MM2. MM1 shows significantly smaller values of 0.1 \u2212 0.2. This is consistent with\nthe morphology namely that the clouds are clumpy and MM1\nis not resolved by the NANTEN2 beam. The derived temperatures for MM1 are about a factor 2 larger compared to the\ntemperatures derived from CO 4\u20133 and are compatible with\nthe temperatures derived from the observed ratio R74 (consistent with f < 1). The gas densities found for MM1 and MM2\nare about 104 cm\u22123 . In contrast to the LTE results, we find a\nmonotonously growing NC /NH2 along the cut in MM2 with values of 1-5 \u00d710\u22125 . The column densities, given in Table 3, result in C/CO abundance ratios between 0.16\u20130.6 Similar abundance ratios have been observed in other Galactic star form4\n\nTaken at R.A.(J2000.0)= 11h 15m 10.s 2,\n\u221261 16\u2032 45.\u2032\u2032 52, FITS file name: lsan20100302.fits\n5\nhttp://isowww.estec.esa.nl/ida/\n\u25e6\n\n3\n\nhttp://www.ipac.caltech.edu/\n\n7\n\nDec.(J2000.0)=\n\n\f8\n\nR\u00f6llig et al.: Photon Dominated Regions in NGC 3603\n\nTable 3.

The C/CO ratio is supposed to depend on the local FUV intensity due to dependency of the\nCO formation and destruction balance on the FUV illumination. Sun et al. (2008) found significantly lower C/CO ratios in\nIC348 where the FUV field varies between 1 and 100 Draine\nunits. On the other hand, Kramer et al. (2008) found C/CO ratios comparable to our results in the Carina region, where the\nFUV field is also comparable to NGC 3603. We also find a\nmonotonously growing C/CO abundance ratio along the cut\nin MM2. A similar trend has been found by Mookerjea et al.\n(2006), namely that the C/CO ratio is higher further away from\nthe sources of FUV radiation.\n\n5. Summary and Conclusions\nWe used the NANTEN2-4m telescope to map the emission of atomic carbon and CO in the vicinity of the central\nOB cluster in the Galactic star forming region NGC 3603.\nThese data are the first observations of CO 4\u20133, CO 7\u20136,\n[CI] 1\u20130, and [CI] 2\u20131 in NGC 3603. We present fully sampled 200\u2032\u2032 \u00d7200\u2032\u2032 maps integrated over the full velocity range\nas well as velocity channel maps. The observed field includes\nthe central OB cluster, as well as the two adjacent molecular\nclumps MM1 and MM2, hosting two pillars observed by the\nHST and similar in appearance to the famous pillar structures\nin the M16 nebula. We selected two cuts from the OB cluster\nposition to the peak emission in MM1 and MM2 for detailed\nanalysis. The spectra along the two cuts show a rich kinematic\nstructure, especially towards MM2. The observed maps show\na strong correlation between the spatial distribution of C and\nCO. This implies either a face-on configuration of the clouds,\ni.e., both clouds being not in the same plane as the OB cluster\nand thus being illuminated face-on, or a more complex configuration, for instance a composition of many small clumps.\nThe overall good C-CO correlation may indicate an unresolved,\nclumpy structure, but the increase of NC towards a cloud edge\ncould hint towards relatively well shielded inner parts.\nUsing escape probability model calculations we derived\ntemperatures, densities, and column densities for both clouds\nfrom the observed line ratios. The temperatures are 43 K and\n47 K for the peak positions of MM1 and MM2, respectively.\nWe find gas densities of n = 103 \u2212 104 cm\u22123 in MM1 and\nMM2. From the best fit CO column densities we derive total\nH2 column densities (filling corrected) of 0.9 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 and\n\nNtot\n[1021 cm\u22122 ]\n33.3\n27.9\n51.0\n38.0\n22.9\n31.5\n45.2\n\nNtot \u00d7 f\n[1021 cm\u22122 ]\n3.7\n7.7\n21.8\n25.3\n8.8\n4.0\n8.5\n\nMEP\n[M\u2299 ]\n693\n581\n1061\n791\n477\n657\n942\n\n<n>\n[cm\u22123 /beam]\n9775\n8197\n14969\n11154\n6734\n9262\n13288\n\n2.5 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 for MM1 and MM2 and a ratio of NC /NH2 of\n1-5\u00d710\u22125.\nThe cluster is strongly interacting with the ambient molecular cloud and governing its structure and physical conditions.\nThe stability analysis shows the existence of gravitationally\nbound gas which should lead to star formation. Embedded\nIR sources have already been observed in the outskirts of the\nmolecular cloud and support our conclusions.\nWe used HIRES/IRAS far-infrared data to narrow down\nthe value of the FUV field at the positions of the two molecular clouds. Consistent with estimates from spectral type approximations and with [CII] observations by ISO we find \u03c7 \u2248\n3 \u2212 6 \u00d7 103 in units of the Draine field.\nHowever, many issues remain unresolved. For example, the\nanalysis results are not conclusive regarding the clumpiness\nof the gas. NGC 3603 will be observed within the Herschel\nGuaranteed Time Key project Warm and Dense ISM - WADI.\nThese data will allow us to perform a much more detailed study\nof the local gas conditions. Cooling lines like [O I] and [C II]\nas well as high-J CO lines can be used to study the clumpiness\nand the energy balance of the gas.\nAcknowledgements.
