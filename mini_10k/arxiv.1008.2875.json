Dust emission at sub-millimeter to centimeter wavelengths is often simply the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of dust particles at thermal\nequilibrium and is used as a cold mass tracer in various environments including nearby galaxies. However, well-sampled spectral\nenergy distributions of the nearby, star-forming Magellanic Clouds have a pronounced (sub-)millimeter excess (Israel et al., 2010).\nAims. This study attempts to confirm the existence of such a millimeter excess above expected dust, free-free and synchrotron emission\nand to explore different possibilities for its origin.\nMethods. We model near-infrared to radio spectral energy distributions of the Magellanic Clouds with dust, free-free and synchrotron\nemission. A millimeter excess emission is confirmed above these components and its spectral shape and intensity are analysed in light\nof different scenarios: very cold dust, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fluctuations, a change of the dust spectral index and\nspinning dust emission.\nResults. We show that very cold dust or CMB fluctuations are very unlikely explanations for the observed excess in these two\ngalaxies. The excess in the Large Magellanic Cloud can be satisfactorily explained either by a change of the spectral index due to\nintrinsic properties of amorphous grains, or by spinning dust emission. In the Small Magellanic Cloud however, due to the importance\nof the excess, the dust grain model including TLS/DCD effects cannot reproduce the observed emission in a simple way. A possible\nsolution was achieved with spinning dust emission, but many assumptions on the physical state of the interstellar medium had to be\nmade.\nConclusions. Further studies, using higher resolution data from Planck and Herschel, are needed to probe the origin of this observed\nsubmm-cm excess more definitely. Our study shows that the different possible origins will be best distinguished where the excess is\nthe highest, as is the case in the Small Magellanic Cloud.\nKey words.

Introduction\n(Sub-)millimeter to centimeter emission in galaxies is thought\nto be quite simple, originating from a combination of dust emission, free-free and synchrotron emission. Thermal free-free radiation originates in the ionized gas of Hii regions and its emission is nearly flat in this optically thin regime of the spectrum (S \u03bd \u221d \u03bd\u22120.1 ). Synchrotron radiation is emitted by relativistic electrons accelerated in magnetic fields and its spectrum is also a power law (S \u03bd \u221d \u03bd\u2212\u03b1sync ). The spectral index of\nsynchrotron emission and the relative contribution of these two\nemission mechanisms to the intensity observed at a given wavelength is constrained by radio observations. Dust emission observed at far-infrared and millimeter wavelengths is produced\nby large dust grains in thermal equilibrium that emit as a modSend offprint requests to: C. Bot\n\nified black-body (S \u03bd \u221d \u03bd\u03b2 B\u03bd (T dust ) where \u03b2 is frequently taken\nas \u223c 2). Because of the wavelength dependence of thermal dust\nemission, millimeter dust emission is often used as a tracer of\nthe cold molecular gas reservoir in a galaxy (e.g. Guelin et al.\n1993; Dunne & Eales 2001; Rubio et al. 2004; Weiss et al. 2008;\nVlahakis et al. 2008). This information is particularly interesting\nsince cold H2 is almost impossible to observe and the use of CO\nline emission is not straightforward, in particular at low metallicities (Israel 1988; Lequeux et al. 1994; Israel 1997b). Millimeter\ndust emission could be a good alternative to the CO molecule\nfor tracing cold matter, also in low metallicity environments\n(Thronson 1988; Israel 1997a; Rubio et al. 2004; Bot et al. 2007,\n2010).\nThis simple picture is however thrown into doubt by observations of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. Several studies\npresent excess emission in the sub-millimeter that at face value\n\n\f2\n\nC. Bot et al.: mm-cm excess in the Magellanic clouds\n\ntrace large amounts of very cold dust with temperatures below\n10K (Reach et al. 1995; Chini et al. 1995; Kr\u00fcgel et al. 1998;\nPopescu et al. 2002; Galliano et al. 2003; Dumke et al. 2004).\nBut, as already noted by Reach et al. (1995), the spatial correlation of this very cold dust with the warm component in\nour galaxy argues against this interpretation. In nearby galaxies also, the scenario of very cold dust is rejected based on\ndifferent physical arguments (Lisenfeld et al. 2002, e.g.). This\nsub-millimeter excess is then alternatively attributed to variations of optical properties of dust grains. For example, low spectral emissivity index values, \u03b2, might apply (Dupac et al. 2003b;\nAguirre et al. 2003). Variations of the spectral emissivity index with dust temperature have been noted (Dupac et al. 2003a;\nD\u00e9sert et al. 2008). These variations could be related to physical properties of amorphous solids (Meny et al. 2007). However,\nin nearby galaxies, such variations in dust properties might be\ndifficult to disentangle from the effect of mixing different dust\ncomponents, with different dust temperatures, along the line of\nsight. Data at numerous wavelengths covering the far-infrared\n(FIR) to the millimeter regime are required to better constrain\nthe emission from dust in nearby galaxies.\nAt longer wavelengths (\u223c 30GHz, \u223c 1cm), another\nexcess of emission has been observed in our galaxy and\nis called \"anomalous dust\" (e.g. Draine & Lazarian 1998a;\nLagache 2003; de Oliveira-Costa et al. 2004; Finkbeiner et al.\n2004; Casassus et al. 2006; Miville-Desch\u00eanes et al. 2008;\nDobler & Finkbeiner 2008). This excess is best explained by\nsmall rotating dust grains (\"spinning dust\" Draine & Lazarian\n1998b). Anomalous dust emission remains poorly constrained\nby observations (in particular its variations with the environment). Theoretical models predict that the peak frequency of\nspinning dust emission should shift with grain size or density\n(Ali-Ha\u0131\u0308moud et al. 2009; Ysard & Verstraete 2010). What is\nthe influence of spinning dust emission on submillimeter to radio\nspectral energy distribution of galaxies?\nThe Small and the Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and\nLMC) are two of the nearest galaxies to ours (located at distances of 60 and 50kpc respectively (Deb & Singh 2010;\nSzewczyk et al. 2009; Schaefer 2008; Szewczyk et al. 2008)).\nAs such, they have been extensively observed in all wavelength\nregimes. Their low metallicities (\u223c 1/2 and 1/6 for the LMC\nand the SMC respectively (Pagel 2003)) provide an opportunity\nto test our understanding of astrophysical processes in different\nphysical conditions from our galaxy.\nIsrael et al. (2010) build spectral energy distributions (SEDs)\nof the Magellanic Clouds by combining selected literature flux\ndensities with COBE and WMAP data. The spatial resolution is\nlow (\u223c 1o beam), but the resulting SEDs have an unprecedented\nsampling of wavelengths, particularly at the far-infrared to the\nradio regime and show a pronounced (sub-)millimeter excess. In\nthis papier, we analyse these SEDs of the full SMC and LMC to\nassess the contribution of dust, free-free and synchrotron emission, in order to quantify and study this excess emission and its\npossible origin. Our study is a prototype of future work on more\ndistant galaxies that will use Herschel (60-600\u03bcm) and Planck (\nup to\u223c10 mm) data.\nIn section 2, we present a fit of the integrated spectral energy distributions of the Magellanic Clouds, at infrared and radio wavelengths, with dust, free-free and synchrotron emission.\nAbove these three components, a significant emission excess\nis observed in the millimeter-centimeter domain. We explore\nwhether this excess could be associated with very cold dust (Sec.\n4), with cosmic microwave background fluctuations (Sec. 3),\n\nwith the amorphous nature of dust grains (Sec. 5), or with spinning dust emission (Sec 6).\n\n2. Integrated spectra of the Magellanic Clouds\nWe used the spectral energy distribution determined by\nIsrael et al. (2010) for the Small and the Large Magellanic\nClouds. These integrated spectral energy distributions are shown\nin Figure 1 and the infrared and radio emission is fitted with\nthree components: the Draine & Li (2007) dust model, a freefree component and synchrotron emission.\nThe choice of a model to represent dust in the\nMagellanic Clouds is still problematic (e.g. Meixner et al. 2010;\nGordon et al. 2010; Roman-Duval et al. 2010; Kim et al. 2010;\nHony et al. 2010). We chose to use the Draine & Li (2007) dust\nmodel, which is well suited to studies of galaxies spectral energy\ndistribution and has been applied to a number of nearby galaxies observed in the infrared and the submillimeter (Draine et al.\n2007). In this model, a mixture of dust grains is heated by a\ndistribution of starlight intensities. A power law distribution of\ninterstellar radiation field intensities, between Umin and Umax ,\nrepresents photo-dissociation regions (PDR), while a constant\ninterstellar radiation field Umin illuminates the diffuse medium\nof the galaxy.\nDifferent dust mixtures and dust size distributions exist in\nthis model, among which three have been tailored to the LMC\nenvironment and one for the SMC (Weingartner & Draine 2001;\nLi & Draine 2002). However, the SMC dust model was tailored\nto SMC extinction curves built on observations of only a few\nstars that might not represent the interstellar medium of the SMC\nas a whole (Gordon & Clayton 1998). Indeed, fitting the \"typical\" SMC extinction curve (no 2175\u00c5bump, steep FUV rise),\n(Weingartner & Draine 2001) implied a lack of very small carbonaceous grains and a predominance of silicate dust grains\nin the SMC, which contrasts with the 8\u03bcm emission, the clear\nPAH features and the lack of silicate features (in absorption\nor in emission) as it is observed in many regions of the SMC\n(Sandstrom et al. 2010; Bot et al. 2010). Furthermore, studying 17 nearby galaxies observed from the near-infrared to the\nsub-millimeter, (Draine et al. 2007) showed that in no case the\nSMC bar dust model was preferred to the Milky-Way (MW)\nor LMC dust model. Given these considerations, we chose to\nmodel the dust emission in the SMC with the Draine & Li (2007)\ndust model using MW type dust. Note however that this choice\nshould not significantly affect the far-infrared part of the spectrum.\nThe LMC and SMC integrated fluxes from 1.27 to 240\u03bcm\nwere thus fitted with LMC dust models and MW dust models\nrespectively. To do the fit, we use the model spectra as observed\nwith the DIRBE, IRAS and Spitzer photometric bands (i.e. taking into account the spectral response of the instruments and\ncolor corrections with respect to the reference spectral shapes)\nand compare them to the observed fluxes in these same bands,\nwhich avoids the use of color-corrections. The best model dust\nspectra obtained from the fitting procedure are presented in\nFigure 1 and the corresponding parameters obtained are summarized in Table 1.\nFree-free emission in the Magellanic Clouds is taken from\nthe best estimates determined from the best fit of radio data by\nf ree\u2212 f ree\nIsrael et al.

TopHat fluxes at (sub)millimeter wavelength (475\u03bcm to 1.22 mm Aguirre et al. 2003)\nare well reproduced by the expected dust emission fitted to the\ninfrared emission. We observe a small, but significant excess (67\u03c3) emission in the first three WMAP bands at 3.3, 5 and 7.5 mm\n(90,60 and 40 GHz), above extrapolated models (dust, free-free\nand synchrotron). For the SMC integrated spectrum, a clear excess is observed in all TopHat and first four WMAP bands (i.e.\nfrom 476\u03bcm to 10 mm). This shows that in the SMC, the submm part of the SED can not be well accounted for with dust\nmodelling from the knowledge of the far-infrared peak emission\n(up to 240\u03bcm) only.\nPart of the excess observed in the SMC could be due to dust\ncolder than can be extrapolated from far-infrared data points. In\nparticular, a \u223c 60\u03bcm excess has been reported in the Magellanic\nClouds (Bot et al. 2004; Bernard et al. 2008). This 60\u03bcm excess\ncould be a significant part of the total emission in the SMC and\nbias dust models toward high temperatures. To check this, we\nperformed a new fit of the SMC spectrum, similar to the modelling described above, but with a fixed minimum radiation field\nintensity: Umin = 0.1 (which corresponds to T dust \u223c 12K and is\n\nFig. 2.

The result of the fit is\nshown in Figure 2. This model better reproduces observed dust\nemission, including TopHat data between 476 \u03bcm and 1.2 mm\nand will be chosen as our best model of dust emission in the\nSMC in order to be conservative. Still, a significant excess emission remains above the dust, free-free and synchrotron emission,\nbetween wavelengths of 3.3 and 10 mm.\nThe spectrum of this excess in both galaxies is shown in\nFigure 3 and Table 2. It is obtained by subtracting the best model\nemissions (dust, free-free and synchrotron) to the observed spectra. The spectral shape and surface brightness of the excess observed in the LMC and in the SMC are similar (c.f. Figure 3).\nThis suggests that they probably arise from the same physical\nprocess.\n\n\f4\n\nC. Bot et al.: mm-cm excess in the Magellanic clouds\n\nTable 2.

We note that our test is based on\naverage surface brightnesses and as such does not make any use\nof the spatial distribution of the excess in the Magellanic Clouds.\nA study of the excess with respect to the expected CMB fluctuations at different spatial scales would help to better discriminate\nthe significance of CMB fluctuations in that respect.\n\n4. Very cold dust?\n\nFig. 3. Spectral energy distribution of the mm-cm excess in the\nLMC (in green) and in the SMC (in black). The spectral shape\nof the CMB fluctuations (dB\u03bd (2.725K)/dT \u00d7 DeltaT Fixsen\n2009) is scaled to the SMC excess brightnesses for comparison.\nModified black body fits to the LMC and the SMC excess representing a possible cold dust component are shown as dotted\nlines.\n\n3. CMB fluctuations?\nThe intensity of the cosmic microwave background fluctuations\nare expected to be non-negligible at low surface brightnesses\nlike the one observed for the Magellanic Clouds in the mm\u2013cm\nrange. Moreover, in the SMC, the spectral energy distribution\nof the excess is of similar shape to the CMB fluctuations (c.f.\nFigure 3). We therefore estimate the probability that CMB fluctuations in the background of the Magellanic Clouds are at the\norigin of this submm\u2013cm excess.\nTo do so, we created a CMB simulation map that reproduces the observed CMB power spectrum (Larson et al. 2010).\nWe draw 5000 random positions in this CMB map and extract\nintensities of CMB fluctuations at 5mm (60GHz) inside an area\nequal to the one of the SMC and with an annular background\nsubtraction. In Figure 4, we plot an histogram of CMB fluctuations intensities obtained for these 5000 random regions. We\nthen estimate the probability of observing CMB fluctuations at\na surface brightness that is compatible with the observed excess\nsurface brightness (c.f. Tab. 2) at 5mm within 3\u03c3 . We find that\nthis probability amounts to 5% for SMC.\nWe did the same estimate for the LMC. The histogram of\nCMB fluctuations intensities obtained with the same method is\nshown in Figure 2 (left panel). The difference observed between\nthe histograms for the LMC and the SMC corresponds to a size\ndifference between the regions considered in each case (\u223c 4o\nand \u223c 2o radii respectively). For the LMC, we find a 14% probability that the intensity of the excess at 5mm is due to CMB\nfluctuations. However, the spectral shape of the excess in this\ncase differs from the one of CMB fluctuations.\n\nIt is tantalizing to try to explain the excess observed with very\ncold dust, especially since colder dust in the SMC can explain the sub-millimeter part of the excess (c.f. Section 2). To\ncheck this hypothesis, the excess observed is fitted by a modified blackbody representing a possible cold dust component.\nBest fits are shown in Fig. 3 and give dust temperatures of \u223c 3K\ncold\nand spectral indices of \u03b2cold\nLMC = 1.2 and \u03b2S MC = 0.33. Such a\ncold thermal equilibrium temperature for big grains is unrealistic. Furthermore, the spectral dust emissivity index deduced\nfor the SMC is also unrealistically low. Indeed, current observations suggest \u03b2 to be in the range 1\u20132.5(Boulanger et al. 1996;\nLagache et al. 1999; Dupac et al. 2003a; Paradis et al. 2009) and\nthe Kramers-K\u00f6nig equations suggest that a value of 1 as a lower\nlimit to \u03b2 (Emerson 1988). The existence of very cold dust that\nwould explain the observed millimeter excess therefore seems\nvery unlikely.\n\n5. A change of the dust emissivity spectral index?\nAnother hypothesis for explaining the millimeter excess is a\nchange of the spectral emissivity index from the FIR to the mm.\nSuch a change has been observed in our Galaxy (Paradis et al.\n2009) and is related to intrinsic dust properties. To test this\nassumption, we used a model proposed by Meny et al. (2007),\nbased on the properties of amorphous dust grains. They consider\ntwo complementary physical models. The first one describes\nexcitation of acoustic lattice vibrations, due to the interaction\nbetween electromagnetic fields and a disordered charge distribution (DCD). This DCD model is characterized by a correlation length, used to describe the disorder degree of amorphous\nstate.The second model focuses on the processes associated\nwith a distribution of low-energy two-level systems (TLS), such\nas resonant absorption and relaxation processes, temperaturedependent emission. This DCD/TLS model was succesfully used\nto reproduce the FIRAS/WMAP spectrum of galactic diffuse\nemission (Paradis 2007; Paradis et al. 2010, in prep.).\nFits to the LMC and SMC integrated spectra were done for\nall points from 100\u03bcm to 9.1mm. To do so, three parameters\nwere set to be free: the dust temperature, the correlation length\n(LC ) and the ratio of TLS over DCD effects (A ratio). We did\nnot attempt to fit the 60\u03bcm data point as the emission from very\n\n\fC. Bot et al.: mm-cm excess in the Magellanic clouds\n\n5\n\nFig. 4. Histogram of the simulated intensity fluctuations of the CMB measured similarly to the fluxes of the LMC and SMC (left and\nright panels, respectively) at 5mm (60 GHz), for 5000 random positions on the sky. The histograms have been normalized to their\npeak value and the bin size is 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 MJy/sr). The solid vertical line in each pannel corresponds to the measured excess intensity\nat this wavelength, while the dashed lines give the 3\u03c3 error estimates to either side of this measured excess.\nsmall grains that are transiently heated is known to be significant at that wavelength. Best fits are shown in Figure 5 and\ncorrespond to dust equilibrium temperatures of 21K and 24K,\ncorrelation lengths of 6.4 and 12.85 nm and A ratios of 4.4 and\n19.4, for the LMC and the SMC respectively.\nIn the LMC, the DCD/TLS model is able to reproduce observations, assuming a decrease of the correlation length by a\nfactor of 2 and an increase of the TLS processes intensity by a\nfactor of 1.8, with respect to the parameters used to reproduce\nthe spectrum of galactic diffuse emission. This result indicates a\ngood agreement between dust properties in the diffuse medium\nof our Galaxy and in the overall LMC, even if the amorphization\ndegree1 of dust grains is different.\nHowever, for the SMC, the flattening of the spectrum is too\npronounced to be explained only by intrinsic dust properties.\nFigure 5 shows a fit of the SMC SED with the DCD/TLS model.\nIn this case, TLS effect intensity had to be enhanced by a factor\nof 8. Despite this enhancement, an additional component in the\nmillimeter domain is needed to reproduce the data.\nHence, taking into account the properties of amorphous\ngrains satisfactorily explains the excess in the LMC but the\nmodel fails at reproducing the one observed in the SMC.\n\n6. Spinning dust emission?\nThe main mechanism invoked to explain Galactic anomalous excess at millimeter wavelengths is spinning dust emission, as first\nproposed by Draine & Lazarian (1998b). Unlike the excess in\nthe Magellanic clouds, Galactic excess peaks between 20 and 40\nGHz. However, models predict that the peak frequency of spinning dust emission shifts with radiation field intensity, interstellar gas physical parameters2, grain size distribution and electric\ndipole moment (Ali-Ha\u0131\u0308moud et al. 2009; Ysard & Verstraete\n2010).\nHere, we explore the possibility that the excess observed\nin the Magellanic Clouds originates from spinning dust emis1\nThe amorphization degree indicates if the internal structure of a\ngrain is fully or partially amorphous.\n2\nCollision with interstellar gas species may excite or damp the rotation (Draine & Lazarian 1998b).\n\nTable 3.

To do so,\nwe fit the excess observed in the Magellanic Clouds with a\nmodel of spinning dust. In both cases, and in order to reduce\nthe number of free parameters, we make some ad-hoc assump\u221a\ntions. First, the electric dipole moment distribution is \u03bc = m N\n(Draine & Lazarian 1998b), where N is the number of atoms in\nthe grain and m is a constant equal to 0.4 D (Ysard & Verstraete\n2010). The size distribution of dust grains is taken to be the\nsame as in the Draine & Li (2007) model (in order to be consistent with the fit of the mid-infrared part of the SEDs). We make\nthe assumption that the interstellar medium of the Magellanic\nClouds can be modelled as the sum of a diffuse medium and a\nPDR phase. The diffuse medium is assumed to have the same gas\ndensity as in the cold neutral medium in our Galaxy (nH \u223c 30\ncm\u22123 ), while the PDR component has the same density as the\nOrion Bar (nH \u223c 104 cm\u22123 ). Using the radiation field distribution described in Tab. 1, other relevant gas parameters are\ncalculated at thermal equilibrium with CLOUDY (Ferland et al.\n1998). We assume ZS MC = Z\u2299 /6 and ZLMC = Z\u2299 /2. Parameters\nwere taken from the optically thin zone of isochoric simulations\nwith CLOUDY. The main gas species abundances vary with radiation field and density. We present some of the gas parameters\nobtained in Table 3 for the different phases in each galaxy and\nfor a sample of radiation field intensities.\n\n\f6\n\nC. Bot et al.: mm-cm excess in the Magellanic clouds\n\nFig. 5. SEDs of the Magellanic Clouds in the FIR to mm regime, once the free-free and synchrotron emission removed. This spectral\nenergy distribution is fitted from 100\u03bcm to 9.1mm with a dust model with DCD/TLS effects. The spectral shape of the DCD effect\nis shown in light blue while the TLS effects are displayed in dark blue and the total emission is displayed in red\n.\n\nFor the LMC, a good fit is achieved and is shown in Fig. 6\n(left panel) overlaid on the observed excess emission. The resulting PAH mass fraction is qPAH =2.15%, with a carbon abundance in PAH of 0.9 ppm in the diffuse medium and 3.06 ppm in\nthe PDR.\nFor the SMC however, no good fit was achieved with a diffuse+PDR model. Separating the PDR component into a dense\nPDR component (with nH = 105 cm\u22123 ) and a moderately dense\nPDR component (with nH = 103 cm\u22123 ), a good fit of the excess\nemission observed in the SMC is achieved and is shown in Fig.\n6 (right panel). In this case, we deduce qPAH = 0.39%, with a\ncarbon abundance in PAH of 2.20 ppm in the diffuse medium\nand 0.49 ppm in the dense PDR and 0.47 ppm in the moderately\ndense PDR.\nThe spinning dust emission model can therefore reproduce\nthe excess observed in both Magellanic clouds with parameters\nthat are consistent with our current understanding of the interstellar medium in these environments. In particular, the PAH\nmass fractions obtained from the best fits of the millimeter excess are consistent with those obtained from the far-infrared dust\nemission modelling of the spectral energy distributions. This is\nconsistent with the idea that spinning dust emission is produced\nby the smallest grains which are responsible for the mid-IR emission.\nIf the millimeter-centimeter excess is due to spinning dust,\nthe peak frequency of spinning dust emission in the Magellanic\nClouds (139 and 160 GHz \u2013 2.2mm and 1.9mm\u2013 for the LMC\nand SMC respectively) is shifted with respect to what is observed in our Galaxy. This shift depends on three main parameters: the size (the smaller the grain, the higher its emission frequency), the density (if the medium is denser, more grain-gas\ncollisions occur and the anomalous emission peak is shifted toward higher frequencies) and the intensity of the Interstellar radiation Field (ISRF) (above a threshold of G0 = 10, if the ISRF\nintensity increases, the emission peak is shifted to higher frequencies). In order to reproduce the millimeter excess observed\nin the Magellanic Clouds, all three parameters were equally important.\nThis study shows that spinning dust emission is a possible solution for the nature of the observed excess, in the two\nMagellanic Clouds. However, without complementary informa-\n\ntions, many assumptions had to be made (e.g. mixing of two\nor three components along the line of sight, density of the\ninterstellar medium). Also, recent studies (Hoang et al. 2010;\nSilsbee et al. 2010) have shown that refinements on spinning\ndust models can lead to significant changes in the shape and in\nintensity of the spinning dust emission peak. The inclusion of\nsuch effects are beyond the scope of this paper, but could help the\nunderstanding of the excess in the SMC in terms of spinning dust\nemission. We do not claim that the best fits obtained are a unique\nsolution. Higher resolution studies with Planck and Herschel\nwill be necessary to confirm this origin of the excess by assessing the distribution of the millimeter excess in the Magellanic\nClouds as a function of local conditions in better defined environments (e.g. diffuse medium only, HII regions). For example,\nit would be interesting to try to correlate the mm/cm excess in\nthe Magellanic Clouds with PAHs emission to test the scenario\nof spinning dust emission.\n\n7. Conclusion\nComprehensive spectral energy distributions of the Magellanic\nClouds from the near-infrared to the radio are modelled with\ndust, free-free and synchrotron emission. An excess above these\nthree components is observed at millimeter wavelengths. This\nexcess has a similar spectral shape in both Magellanic Clouds\nbut is more prominent in the SMC total SED than in the LMC.\nWe explore different scenarios for the origin of this excess\nemission in the millimeter regime: very cold dust, CMB fluctuations, a change of the dust emissivity spectral index and spinning dust emission. It is shown that very cold dust grains imply\na thouroughly unrealistic nature for this excess and CMB fluctuations are unlikely to solely create such an excess.\nFor the LMC, the mm-cm excess can be explained equally\nwell with TLS/DCD effects in amorphous grains or with spinning dust emission.\nThis is drastically different in the SMC, where the mm-cm\nexcess is more pronounced. In this case, CMB fluctuations become very unlikely and the inclusion of TLS/DCD effects alone\ndoes not reproduce the excess. However, spinning dust emission\nmodels are capable to explain the observed excess with parame-\n\n\fC. Bot et al.: mm-cm excess in the Magellanic clouds\n\n7\n\nFig. 6. Best fits of the millimeter excess observed in the Magellanic Clouds with anomalous dust components as described in the\ntext.\nters that are consistent with our understanding of the ISM in the\nSMC, but many assumptions had to be made to obtain this result.\nWe hence confirm the existence of an unexpected mm-cm\nexcess in the Magellanic Clouds, but the nature of this excess\nremains unclear. Spinning dust is a promising solution, but this\nshould be further tested in better defined physical environments.\nThe mm-cm excess observed in the Magellanic Clouds could\neasily be of a more complex nature, having multiple causes\nrather than a single one, so that the different effects explored\nhere might add up. In this context, Planck and Herschel observations of the Magellanic Clouds are needed to map this excess at\na better spatial resolution, trace its spatial variations and probe\nits origin more definitely.\nAcknowledgements.
