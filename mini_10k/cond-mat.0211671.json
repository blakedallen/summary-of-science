THE FIELD MODELS OF VEHICLES AND POLLUTANTS.\n\nIn the present article we consider two coupled deterministic field model of the urban street\ncanyon. The vehicular fields are one-dimensional in spatial variable x and they depend on\ns\ntime variable t. The considered fields are the vehicular number density kl,vt\n(x, t), vehicus\ns\nlar velocity wl,vt (x, t), emissivity of exhaust gases el,ct,vt (x, t), and vehicular heat emissivity\ns\n\u03c3l,vt\n(x, t), where vt is emission type's number, ct is number of the constituent of emitted\nexhaust gases. It is assumed that there are n1 = nL left lanes s = 1 and l is the left\nlane's number, l = 1, ..., nL , whereas for n2 = nR right lanes s = 2 and l is the right lane's\nnumber, l = 1, ..., nR , vt = 1, ..., V T , ct = 1, ..., CT . V T is total number of types of vehicular emissions, and CT is total number of emitted exhaust gases. The abovementioned\nmodel consists of the equations of balances of vehicular numbers [5] and vehicular equations of state (Greenshields' equilibrium speed-density u-k model [6]) as well as exhaust gas\nemissivities and heat emissivities. The vehicular flow in the canyon is multilane bidirectional one-level rectilinear, and it is considered with two systems of coordinated signalized\njunctions at the upstream and downstream ends of lanes [1], [2], [3], [4]. The considered\nvehicles belong to distinct vehicular classes: passenger cars, and trucks. Emissions from the\nvehicles are based on technical measurements of the following types of pollutants: carbon\nmonoxide CO, hydrocarbons HC, nitrogen oxides NOx . The field model of pollutants is\ngasdynamical. The gases are Newtonian viscous perfect and noninteracting. The considered fields are three-dimensional in spatial variables (x, y, z) and one-dimensional in temporal variable t and they are mixture's density \u03c1(x, y, z, t), velocity v(x, y, z, t), temperature\nT (x, y, z, t), pressure p(x, y, z, t), as well as constituents' mass concentrations ci (x, y, z, t),\nand partial pressures pi (x, y, z, t), i = 1, ..., N, where N is total number of mixture's elements. (N = NE \u2212 1 + NA ). The first NE \u2212 1 = 3 gases are the exhaust gases emitted\nby vehicle engines during combustion CO, CH, NOx . The remaining NA = 9 gases are the\nconstituents of air: O2 , N2 , Ar, CO2 , Ne, He, Kr, Xe, H2 . The field equations are the balances\nof mixture's mass, linear momentum, energy, and equation of state (Clapeyron's law) as\nwell as the balances of masses of constituents and constituents' equations of states (Dalton's law). The studied sources are mixture mass source S(x, y, z, t), mixture energy source\n\u03c3(x, y, z, t), and constituents' mass sources SiE (x, y, z, t) (exhaust gases and consumed oxygen). The boundary-initial problems are of mixed types (Dirichlet's and von Neumann's\ntypes). The equations of dynamics are solved by the finite difference scheme. The two separate multi-criteria optimization problems are posed by defining the dimensionless functionals\nof cumulative total travel time, global emissions of pollutants, and global concentrations of\npollutants, either in the studied street canyon or in the canyon and its two nearest neighbor\nsubstitute canyons. The vector of control is a five-tuple composed of two cycle times, two\ngreen times, and one offset time between the traffic lights. The optimal control problems\nconsists of minimization of the two functionals over the admissible control domain manifold.\nII.

OPTIMAL CONTROL PROBLEMS.\n\nLet us consider the measures of the total travel time (TTT): JTTT [5], emissions (E): JE ,\nand concentrations (C): JC of exhaust gases in the street canyon as well as in the canyon and\ntwo its nearest neighbor substitute canyons, JTTT,ext JE,ext JC,ext , respectively. Therefore the\nappropriate optimization problems may be formulated as follows [2]. The measures depend\non traffic lights at the upstream and downstream ends of the lanes. The vector of boundary\ncontrol u reads:\nu = (g1 , C1 , g2 , C2 , F ) \u2208 U adm ,\n\n(18)\n\ngm are green times, Cm are cycle times, F is offset time, and U adm is a set of admissible\ncontrol variables. The TTT, E, C functionals are given by:\nJTTT (u) =\n\nJE (u) =\n\nns X\n2 X\nVT Z\nX\n\na\n\nZ\n\na\n\nJC (u) = \u03c1STP *\n\ni=1\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nb\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nc\n\nTS\n\n0\n\ns=1 l=1 ct=1 vt=1 0\nNX\nE \u22121 Z a\n\nTS\n\n0\n\ns=1 l=1 vt=1 0\n\nns X\n2 X\nCT X\nVT Z\nX\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nTS\n\ns\nkl,vt\n(x, t)dx dt.\n\n(19)\n\nesl,ct,vt (x, t)dx dt.\n\n(20)\n\nci (x, y, z, t)dx dy dz dt.\n\nJTTT,ext (u) = JTTT (u) +\n+a *\n\nns X\n2 X\nVT\nX\n\ns\n* (Cs \u2212 gs ).\nkl,vt,jam\n\ns=1 l=1 vt=1\n\n4\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\n\fJE,ext (u) = JE (u) +\n+a *\n\nns X\n2 X\nCT X\nVT\nX\n\n(23)\n\nesl,ct,vt,jam * (Cs \u2212 gs ).\n\ns=1 l=1 ct=1 vt=1\n\nJC,ext (u) = JC (u) +\n+\u03c1STP * a * b * c *\n\n(24)\n\nNX\nE \u22121\ni=1\n\nci,STP *\n\n2\nX\n\n(Cs \u2212 gs ).\n\ns=1\n\ns\nThe integrands kl,vt\n, esl,ct,vt , ci in the functionals depend on the control vector u through the\nboundary conditions, through the equations of dynamics, as well as, through the sources.\nThe value of the vector of control u directly affects the boundary conditions for vehicular\ndensities, velocities, and emissivities. It also affects the sources. Next, it propagates to the\nequations of dynamics and then it influences the values of functionals. \u03c1STP is the density of\nair at standard temperature and pressure STP, ci,STP is concentration of the ith constituent\nof air at standard temperature and pressure, a, b, c, are dimensions of the street canyon, TS\nis time of simulation.\nWe define two additional functionals. The first one is the composite total travel time,\nemissions and concentrations of the pollutants in the single canyon, whereas the second one\nin the canyon and two its neighbors:\n\nH(a, u) = \u03b1TTT FTTT (u) + \u03b1E FE (u) + \u03b1C FC (u).\nHext (a, u) = H(a, u) +\n+\u03b1TTT,ext JTTT,ext (u) + \u03b1E,ext JE,ext (u) + \u03b1C,ext JC,ext (u).\n\n(25)\n(26)\n\nThe scaling parameters \u03b1TTT , \u03b1E , \u03b1C , \u03b1TTT,ext , \u03b1E,ext , \u03b1C,ext make the two functionals dimensionless, and\na = (\u03b1TTT , \u03b1E , \u03b1C ) \u2208 Aadm ,\naext = (\u03b1TTT , \u03b1E , \u03b1C , \u03b1TTT,ext , \u03b1E,ext , \u03b1C,ext ) \u2208 Aadm\next ,\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\nwhere Aadm , Aadm\next are the sets of admissible scaling parameters. We formulate two separate\nmulti-criteria optimization problems consisting in minimization of the functionals H, Hext\nwith respect to control vector u over admissible domain and with respect to scaling parameters, while the equations of dynamics are fulfilled:\nH \u22c6 = H(a\u22c6 , u\u22c6 ) = min{a \u2208 Aadm , u \u2208 U adm : H(a, u)}.\n\n(29)\n\nadm\n\u22c6\n: Hext (a, u)},\n= Hext (a\u22c6ext , u\u22c6ext ) = min{aext \u2208 Aadm\nHext\next , u \u2208 U\n\n(30)\n\n\u22c6\nwhere H \u22c6 , Hext\n, are the minimal values of the two functionals, (a\u22c6 , u\u22c6 ), and (a\u22c6ext , u\u22c6ext ), are\nscaling and control vectors at which the functionals reach the minima, respectively.\n\n5\n\n\fIV.
