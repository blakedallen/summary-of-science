These solutions can be just\nan isolated half-monopole or a multimonopole with topological magnetic\ncharge, 21 m, where m is a natural number. These static monopole solutions\nsatisfy the first order Bogomol'nyi equations. The axially symmetric onehalf monopole gauge potentials possess a Dirac-like string singularity along\nthe negative z-axis. The multimonopole gauge potentials are also singular\nalong the z-axis and possess only mirror symmetries.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs (YMH) field theory in 3 + 1 dimensions, with the\nHiggs field in the adjoint representation possess both the magnetic monopole and\nmultimonopole solutions [1]-[4]. The 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole solution belongs\nto the category of solutions which are invariant under a U(1) subgroup of the\nlocal SU(2) gauge group and has non zero Higgs mass and self-interaction. This\nnumerical monopole solution of unit magnetic charge is spherically symmetric [1].\nIn general, configurations of the YMH field theory with a unit magnetic charge\nare spherically symmetric [1]-[3]. However this is not always true as we will show\nin this letter that unit magnetic monopole charge solutions need not possess only\nradial symmetry. In fact our unit magnetic charge solution posseses only mirror\nsymmetry about a vertical plane through the z-axis. This particular solution is\nactually made up of two half-monopoles positioned at the origin.\n\u2217\n\nUSM Preprint, June 2004; Accepted for publication in the International Journal of Modern\nPhysics A\n\u2020\nemail address: rosyteh@usm.my\n\n1\n\n\fMultimonopole configurations with magnetic charges greater than unity possess\nat most axial symmetry [4] and it has been shown that these solutions cannot\npossess spherical symmetry [5].\nExact monopole and multimonopoles solutions exist in the Bogomol'nyi-PrasadSommerfield (BPS) limit [3]-[4]. Outside the BPS limit, when the Higgs field\npotential is non-vanishing only numerical solutions are known. Asymmetric multimonopole solutions with no rotational symmetry are also shown to exist [6].\nHowever these solutions are numerical solutions even in the BPS limit.\nNumerical axially symmetric monopoles-antimonopoles chain solutions which\ndo not satisfy the Bogomol'nyi condition have also been discussed. These nonBogomol'nyi solutions exist both in the limit of a vanishing Higgs potential as well\nas in the presence of a finite Higgs potential . Numerical BPS axially symmetric\nvortex rings solutions have also been reported [7].\nRecently, we have also shown that the extended ansatz of Ref.[7]-[8] possesses\nmore exact multimonopole-antimonopole configurations. We have also constructed\nthe anti-configurations of all these multimonopole-antimonopole solutions [10] with\nall the magnetic monopole charges reversing their sign. Hence monopoles becomes\nantimonopoles and vice versa. We have also constructed exact magnetically neutral\nvortex rings in the presence of a antimonopole-monopole-antimonopole chain [11].\nHowever, all these monopole solutions reported so far are of integer topological monopole charges. It is our purpose in this letter to show the existence of\nhalf-integer topological monopole charge solutions. We have constructed a halfmonopole configuration which is axially symmetric and possess a Dirac-like string\nsingularity along the negative z-axis.\nHowever half-monopole solutions are not necessarily axially symmetric as we\nhave also obtained a half-monopole solution that possesses only mirror symmetry\nabout a vertical plane through the z-axis. In fact this half-monopole configuration\nis a member of a series of multimonopole solutions which we would like to label\nas the C solutions. The multimonopole of the C solutions possesses half-integer\ntopological monopole charge.\nThe existence of smooth Yang-Mills potentials which correspond to monopoles\nand vortices of one-half winding number has been demonstrated in Ref. [12] recently. However no exact or numerical solutions of the YMH equations have been\ngiven.\nWe briefly review the SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs field theory in the next section.\nWe present the ansatz and some of its basic properties in section 3 and the axially symmetric half-monopole solution in section 4. In section 5, we discuss the\nhalf-integer topological charge multimonopole C solutions. We end with some\ncomments in section 6.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nThe SU(2) YMH Theory\n\nThe SU(2) YMH Lagrangian in 3+1 dimensions with vanishing Higgs mass and\nself interaction is\n1 a a\u03bc\u03bd 1 \u03bc a\nL = \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd\nF\n+ D \u03a6 D\u03bc \u03a6a .\n(1)\n4\n2\nThe covariant derivative of the Higgs field and the gauge field strength tensor are\na\ngiven respectively by D\u03bc \u03a6a = \u2202\u03bc \u03a6a + \u01ebabc Ab\u03bc \u03a6c , and F\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd Aa\u03bc +\n\u01ebabc Ab\u03bc Ac\u03bd , where Aa\u03bc is the gauge potential and the gauge field coupling constant\ng is set to one without any loss of generality. The metric used is g\u03bc\u03bd = (\u2212 + ++).\nThe SU(2) internal group indices a, b, c run from 1 to 3 and the spatial indices are\n\u03bc, \u03bd, \u03b1 = 0, 1, 2, and 3 in Minkowski space.\nThe equations of motion that follow from the Lagrangian (1) are\na\nD \u03bc F\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212 \u01ebabc \u03a6b D\u03bd \u03a6c = 0,\n\nD \u03bc D\u03bc \u03a6a = 0.\n\n(2)\n\nThe Bogomol'nyi equations is Bia \u00b1 Di \u03a6a = 0. The \u00b1 sign corresponds to\nmonopoles and antimonopoles respectively for the usual BPS solutions [13]. In our\ncase the multimonopole-antimonopoles of Ref. [9] are solved with the + sign and\nthe anti-multimonopole solutions are solvable with the \u2212 sign [10].\nThe tensor to be identified with the electromagnetic field, as was proposed by\n't Hooft [1] is\na\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a6\u0302a F\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212 \u01ebabc \u03a6\u0302a D\u03bc \u03a6\u0302b D\u03bd \u03a6\u0302c\n\n= \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc \u2212 \u01ebabc \u03a6\u0302a \u2202\u03bc \u03a6\u0302b \u2202\u03bd \u03a6\u0302c ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere A\u03bc = \u03a6\u0302a Aa\u03bc , the Higgs unit vector, \u03a6\u0302a = \u03a6a /|\u03a6|, and the Higgs field mag\u221a\nnitude |\u03a6| = \u03a6a \u03a6a .

Therefore the magnitude and\nhence the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field vanish as 1/r at large r.\nSince the solution, \u03c8(r) does not vanish at r = 0, the gauge potentials of Eq.(6)\nare singular at the origin and hence the energy of the system is not finite.\nFor the profile function G(\u03b8, \u03c6) to be a single value function, the parameter b\nis restricted to only half-integer values.\n\n4\n\nThe Axially Symmetric Half-Monopole\n\nIn order to obtain axially symmetric solutions, the parameter b, and hence the\nprofile function G(\u03b8, \u03c6) is set to zero to eliminate the \u03c6 dependence of the gauge\n5\n\n\fpotentials [11].

This is in contrast\nto the Dirac 1-monopole which is radially symmetrical. The magnetic field, Bi ,\npoints radially outwards from \u03b8 = 0 . . . 2.82 radian, after which it changes sign and\npoints inwards. It blows up along the the negative z-axis giving rise to the string\nsingularity, Fig.(1).\nThe existence of smooth Yang-Mills potentials which correspond to monopoles\nand vortices of one-half winding number in the SU(2) YMH field has also been\ndemonstrated in Ref. [12]. The Abelian magnetic field of the half-monopole solution (19) is similar to that discussed in Ref. [12] in that the magnetic field is\naxially symmetrical and possess a Dirac-like string singularity along the negative\nz-axis, Fig.(1).\nThe axially symmetric monopole solutions for m > \u2212 12 , is discussed in a separate work [11] when m is a natural number and in a later work when m is a\npositive non-integer.\n\n5\n\nThe C Series of Solutions\n\nThe C solution is a series of multimonopole solutions with half-integer topological\nmagnetic charge. The multimonopole is located at the origin, r = 0, and has\npositive topological magnetic charge, M = m \u2208 {0, 21 , 1, 32 , 2, . . .}. This series of\nsolutions is solved by writing, p = 0 and b = m in Eq.(15) to Eq.(17). The\nsolutions obtained are\n1\n, R(\u03b8) = m csc \u03b8, G(\u03b8, \u03c6) = m csc \u03b8 tan(m\u03c6).\n(21)\n\u03c8(r) =\n1+r\n6\n\n\fThe boundary conditions are \u03c8(r)|r\u21920 = 1, \u03c8(r)|r\u2192\u221e = 0 and G(\u03b8, 0) = G(\u03b8, 2\u03c0) =\n0.\nThe magnetic charge of the monopole at r = 0 is calculated to be one-half of\nthe normal t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole charge when m = 21 . This half-monopole\nsolution of the C series is different from the half-monopole, Eq.(19), of the axially\nsymmetric series in that it possesses only mirror symmetry at the vertical plane\nthrough the x-z axes. It however possesses similar string singularity along the\nnegative z-axis.\nThe magnetic field, Bi = Br r\u0302i + B\u03b8 \u03b8\u0302i + B\u03c6 \u03c6\u0302i , of the C half-monopole is plotted\nFig.(2). The radial magnetic field, Br , of this half-monopole possesses a string\nsingularity along the negative z-axis as shown by the plot of Fig.(3).\nWhen m = 0 and 1, the C configurations possess topological magnetic charge\none. The 1-monopole when, m = 0, is just the radially symmetric Wu-Yang type\n1-monopole [8]-[9] whereas the 1-monopole when, m = 1, possesses only mirror\nsymmetry at the vertical x-z plane. The 3-D surface plot of the Abelian magnetic\nenergy density, Bi Bi , reveals that this particular 1-monopole is actually made up\nof two half-monopoles.\nThe C series of solutions continue to support higher topological magnetic charge\nmultimonople as m increases in steps of half. Hence when m = 23 , 2, 52 , 3, . . ., the\ntopological charge of the multimonopole is M = 32 , 2, 52 , 3, . . . respectively. All\nthese C multimonopoles except for the case when, m = 0, seem to be made up of\nhalf-monopoles.\n\n6\n\nComments\n\nWe have presented two different half-integer topological magnetic charge monopole\nsolutions. These two half-monopole solutions possess some similar descriptions to\nthat of Ref. [12] in that they both possess a Dirac-like string singularity along the\nnegative z-axis. The C half-monopole solution possesses only mirror symmetry\nat the vertical x-z plane. Hence half-monopole solutions can possess both axial\nsymmetry, as well as mirror symmetry at a plane. Only axially symmetrical halfmonopole Abelian magnetic field was discussed in Ref. [12].\nAll the C multimonopoles seem to be composed of 2m half-monopoles located\nat the origin when m = 21 , 1, 32 , 2, . . .. The C monopole configurations possess only\nmirror symmetries.\nBesides the half-integer topological magnetic charge solutions given here, there\nalso exist other monopole series of solutions of similar property. These solutions are\nsolved within the same magnetic ansatz of Eq.(6). The A2 multimonopole solutions\nof Ref. [9] and [10] possess topological magnetic charge, M = 52 , 3, 27 , 4, . . ., at the\norigin. There also exist other half-integer topological magnetic charge, axially\nsymmetric solutions when, \u2212 12 < m < 12 . We will these cases in a later work.\nThe A1 multimonopole screening solutions [10] also possess multimonopole of\nhalf-integer topological charge, M = 52 , 3, 27 , 4, . . ., at the origin.\n7\n\n\f7\n\nAcknowlegements\n\nThe author, Rosy Teh, would like to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia for the short\nterm research grant (Account No: 304/PFIZIK/634039).\n\nReferences\n[1] G.
