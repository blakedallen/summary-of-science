The experiment was performed at Jefferson Lab with the CEBAF Large Acceptance\nSpectrometer using circularly polarized tagged photons incident on an unpolarized hydrogen target.\nBeam-helicity-dependent angular distributions of the final-state particles were measured. The large\ncross-section asymmetries exhibit strong sensitivity to the kinematics and dynamics of the reaction.\nThe data are compared with the results of various phenomenological model calculations, and show\nthat these models currently do not provide an adequate description for the behavior of this new\nobservable.\nPACS numbers: 13.60.-r, 13.60.Le, 13.88.+e\n\nThe study of the baryon spectrum provides an avenue to a deeper understanding of the strong interaction, since the properties of the excited states of baryons\nreflect the dynamics and relevant degrees of freedom\nwithin them. Many nucleon resonances in the mass region above 1.6 GeV decay predominantly through either\n\u03c0\u2206 or \u03c1N intermediate states into \u03c0\u03c0N final states (see\nthe Particle-Data Group review [1]). Resonances predicted by symmetric quark models, but not observed in\nthe \u03c0N channel (the so-called \"missing\" resonances), are\npredicted to lie in the region of W > 1.8 GeV [2]. This\nmakes electromagnetic double-pion production an important tool in the investigation of the structure of the nucleon.\nTo date, a rather large amount of unpolarized crosssection measurements of double-pion photo- and electroproduction on the proton have been reported by several\ncollaborations [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. However, the\ndatabase collected for polarization observables remains\nquite sparse. Polarization degrees of freedom in charged\ndouble-pion production have been studied at SLAC [13]\nand in the context of the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule\nat MAMI [14].\nOn the theoretical side, some experience has been\ngained during the last decade [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,\n22, 23]. It should be noted that the various models which\nare presently used are constructed according to the same\nscheme - effective Lagrangian densities, where the pa-\n\nrameters for resonant and background mechanisms (contact and u, t-channel pole terms) are either taken from\nother experiments or are treated as free parameters in\nthe analysis. Aside from the wide variations in the corresponding coupling constants allowed by the Particle-Data\nGroup listing, the primary source of differences between\nthe models is the treatment of the background, which appears to be very complicated in the effective Lagrangian\napproach for double-pion photoproduction. A better understanding of the double-pion photoproduction dynamics is vital for the reliable extraction of N \u2217 photocouplings. Polarization data, being particularly sensitive to\ninterference effects, are expected to provide valuable constraints.\nIn this Letter, we report the first comprehensive measurement of the beam-helicity asymmetry [24]\nI\u2299 =\n\n1 \u03c3+ \u2212 \u03c3\u2212\n*\nP\u03b3 \u03c3 + + \u03c3 \u2212\n\n(1)\n\nin the ~\u03b3 p \u2192 p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 reaction, for energies W between\n1.35 GeV and 2.30 GeV in the center of mass, where the\nphoton beam is circularly polarized and neither target\nnor recoil polarization is specified. P\u03b3 is the degree of circular polarization of the photon and \u03c3 \u00b1 are the cross sections for the two photon-helicity states \u03bb\u03b3 = \u00b11. Here,\nwe give a brief overview of our data and demonstrate,\nby means of a phenomenological model, the sensitivity of\nthis observable to the dynamics of the reaction.\n\n\f3\nThe experiment was performed in Hall B at the\nThomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). Longitudinally polarized electrons with an energy E0 = 2.445 GeV were incident on a thin radiator.\nThe beam polarization was routinely monitored during\ndata taking by a M\u00f8ller polarimeter and was, on average, 0.67. A photon tagger system [25] was used to\ntag photons in the energy range between 0.5 GeV and\n2.3 GeV, with an energy resolution of 0.1% E0 . The\ndegree of circular polarization of the photon beam is\nproportional to the electron-beam polarization and is\na monotonic function of the ratio of the photon and\nincident electron energies [26]. The degree of photonbeam polarization varied from \u2248 0.16 at the lowest photon energy up to \u2248 0.66 at the highest energy. The\nphoton-helicity state changes with the electron-beam helicity, which was flipped pseudo-randomly at a rate of\n30 Hz. The collimated photon beam irradiated an 18cm thick liquid-hydrogen target. The final-state hadrons\nwere detected in the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) [27]. The CLAS provides a large coverage for charged particles that includes particle momenta down to 0.25 GeV/c and polar angles in the range\n8\u25e6 < \u03b8lab < 145\u25e6 . The event trigger required a coincidence between a scattered-electron signal from the photon tagger and at least one charged track in the CLAS.\nThe four-momentum vectors of the particles were reconstructed from their tracks in the toroidal magnetic field of\nthe spectrometer by a set of three drift-chamber packages\nand by particle identification using time-of-flight information from plastic scintillators located about 5 m from\nthe target.\nThe ~\u03b3 p \u2192 p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 reaction channel was identified in\nthis kinematically complete experiment by the missingmass technique, requiring either the detection of all three\nfinal-state particles or the detection of two out of the\nthree particles.\nA schematic view of the reaction, together with angle definitions, is shown in Fig. 1. A total of 3 \u00d7 107\np\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events were accumulated for both helicity states\nN \u00b1 . Experimental values of the helicity asymmetry were\nthen obtained as\n\u2299\nIexp\n=\n\n1\nP\u0304\u03b3\n\n*\n\nN + /\u03b1+ \u2212 N \u2212 /\u03b1\u2212\n,\nN + /\u03b1+ + N \u2212 /\u03b1\u2212\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b1\u00b1 = 12 (1 \u00b1 ac ) accounts for helicity-dependent\ndifferences in the luminosity due to a small electronbeam-charge asymmetry ac \u2248 \u22120.0044. The value of ac\nwas determined from helicity asymmetries in single-pion\nphotoproduction for data that were obtained simultaneously with the double-pion photoproduction data. Any\nobserved asymmetry in this reaction is instrumental [28].\nThe experimental asymmetries have not been corrected\nfor the CLAS acceptance. In order to allow for an analysis as model-independent as possible, the data are compared with event-weighted mean values of asymmetries\n\n\u03c0+\nx\nk\np'\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03b8\n\nz\n\u03b8cm\n\np\n\n\u03c0\u2212\n\nFIG. 1: Angle definitions for the circularly polarized realphoton reaction ~\u03b3 p \u2192 p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ; \u03b8cm is defined in the overall\ncenter-of-mass frame, and \u03b8 and \u03c6 are defined as the \u03c0 + polar\nand azimuthal angles in the rest frame of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 system\nwith the z direction along the total momentum of the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\nsystem (helicity frame).\n\nfrom model calculations [29]. The determination of these\nmean values does not require a knowledge of the CLAS\nacceptance. The only major source of systematic uncertainty is the value for the beam polarization, which is\nknown to about 3%. The uncertainty from the beamcharge asymmetry is negligible (less than 10\u22123 ).\nFigure 2 shows \u03c6 angular distributions of the helicity\nasymmetry for various selected 50-MeV-wide center-ofmass energy bins between W = 1.40 and 2.30 GeV. The\ndata are integrated over the full CLAS acceptance. The\nanalysis shows large asymmetries which change markedly\nwith W up to 1.80 GeV; thereafter they remain rather\nstable. The asymmetries are odd functions of \u03c6 and vanish for coplanar kinematics (\u03c6 = 0 and 180\u25e6), as expected\nfrom parity conservation [24]. The large number of observed ~\u03b3 p \u2192 p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events allows for a confident analysis of the data in selected kinematic regions, making\nit possible to tune the different parts of the production\namplitude independently. An example of distributions\nwhich are more differential than those of Fig. 2 is given\nin Fig. 3. The data at W = 1.50 GeV are divided into\nnine bins in the invariant mass M (p\u03c0 + ).\nThe data in Figs. 2 and 3 are compared with results\nof available phenomenological models. In the approach\nby Mokeev et al. (solid curves), double-charged-pion\nphoto- and electroproduction are described by a set of\nquasi-two-body mechanisms with unstable particles in\nthe intermediate states: \u03c0\u2206, \u03c1N , \u03c0N (1520), \u03c0N (1680),\n\u03c0\u2206(1600) and with subsequent decays to the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 p final state [19, 20, 21]. Residual direct \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 p mechanisms are parametrized by exchange diagrams [21]. The\nfirst two quasi-two-body channels mentioned above are\ndescribed by a coherent sum of s-channel N \u2217 contributions and nonresonant mechanisms [19]. All well established resonances with observed double-pion decays are\nincluded, plus \u2206(1600), N (1700), N (1710), and a new\n+\nstate, N (1720) with J \u03c0 = 3/2 , possibly observed in\n\n\f4\n0.3\n\n0.5\nW = 1.45 GeV\n\n1.10 GeV\n\nW = 1.50 GeV\n\nI\n\nI\n\n\u274d\n\u22c5\n\n\u274d\n\u22c5\n\nW = 1.40 GeV\n0\n\n1.23 GeV\n\n1.27 GeV\n\n1.33 GeV\n\n1.37 GeV\n\n0\n\n1.20 GeV\nW = 1.60 GeV\n\nW = 1.65 GeV\n\nI\n\n\u274d\n\u22c5\n\nW = 1.55 GeV\n\u274d\n\u22c5\n\n1.16 GeV\n\n-0.5\n0.5\n\n-0.3\n0.3\n\nI\n\n1.13 GeV\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n0.5\n\n1.30 GeV\n\nI\n\n\u274d\n\u22c5\n\nW = 1.75 GeV\n\nW = 1.80 GeV\n\nI\n\nW = 1.70 GeV\n\n\u274d\n\u22c5\n\n-0.3\n0.3\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-0.3\n0.3\n\nI\n\n\u274d\n\u22c5\n\nW = 1.90 GeV\n\nW = 2.10 GeV\n\n180\n\u03c6 (deg)\n\n360 0\n\n180\n\u03c6 (deg)\n\n360 0\n\n180\n\u03c6 (deg)\n\n0\n\n180\n\u03c6 (deg)\n\n360 0\n\n180\n\u03c6 (deg)\n\n360 0\n\n180\n\u03c6 (deg)\n\n360\n\nFIG. 3: Helicity asymmetries at W = 1.50 GeV for nine bins\nof the invariant mass M (p\u03c0 + ), as indicated.

The dashed curves\nshow results of calculations by Fix and Arenh\u00f6vel [23] (for\nW \u2264 1.70 GeV).\n\nCLAS double-pion data [9]. N \u2217 and nonresonant parameters are fitted to the CLAS cross-section data for\nvirtual-photon double-charged-pion production [9]. The\nmodel provides a good description of all available CLAS\ncross-section and world data on double-pion photo- and\nelectroproduction at W < 1.9 GeV and Q2 < 1.5 GeV2 .\nResults also have been obtained by Fix and Arenh\u00f6vel\nusing the model described in [23]. They use an effective Lagrangian approach with Born and resonance diagrams at the tree level. The model includes the nucleon,\nthe \u2206(1232), N (1440), N (1520), N (1535), N (1680),\n\u2206(1620), N (1675), and N (1720) resonances, as well as\nthe \u03c3 and \u03c1 mesons. The corresponding results are shown\nin Figs. 2 and 3 as dashed curves. For completeness, we\nnote that the recent work of Roca [18] shows our preliminary data [30] in the framework of the Valencia model\nfor double-pion photoproduction.\nAlthough both models had previously provided a good\n\ndescription of unpolarized cross sections, neither of the\nmodels is able to provide a reasonable description of the\nbeam-asymmetry data over the entire kinematic range\ncovered in this experiment. Even though the model predictions agree remarkably well for certain conditions (see,\ne.g., the dashed curves in Fig. 3), for other conditions\nthey are much worse and sometimes even out of phase\nentirely.\nAs is noted above, the main theoretical challenge for\ndouble-pion photoproduction lies in the fact that several\nsubprocesses may contribute, even though any given individual contribution may be small. In this connection,\nthe polarization measurements should be very helpful in\nseparating the individual terms. The particular sensitivity of the beam asymmetry to interference effects among\nvarious amplitudes is illustrated in Fig. 2. The dotted\ncurves show results of calculations by Mokeev et al. with\na relative phase of \u03c0 between the background- and \u03c0\u2206subchannel amplitudes. The access to interference effects permit a cleaner separation of background and resonances. This in term makes it possible to make more\nreliable statements about the existence and properties of\nnucleon resonances.\nFigure 4 shows the helicity asymmetry as a function\nof the invariant mass M (p\u03c0 \u2212 ) for two different values of\nW and a fixed value of \u03c6. This is a typical case. The\nmost interesting features of these data are the changes\nthat occur as M (p\u03c0 \u2212 ) traverses the \u2206(1232) resonance.\nAt W = 1.55 GeV, a maximum is seen in the region\nof this resonance. We see a similar trend in the region of the higher-mass resonances around 1.60 GeV for\nW = 1.95 GeV.

The curves are the results of Mokeev et al. [19, 20, 21]\n(solid) and Fix and Arenh\u00f6vel [23] (dashed) for W = 1.55 GeV\nonly. Note that the result of Fix and Arenh\u00f6vel is in phase\nwith the data (filled circles) and that of Mokeev et al. is not.\nThe vertical lines indicate the masses of the known N and \u2206\nresonances.\n\nlicity asymmetry (along with other polarization observables) could be used in studies of baryon spectroscopy.\nOf particular interest is the study of sequential decays\nof resonances, such as N (1520) \u2192 \u03c0\u2206 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0N , or\nN (1700) \u2192 \u03c0N (1520) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0N , which can be studied\nat moderate values of W from 1.5 to 1.9 GeV; see [10].\nHere, the \u03c1-production channel is also open. This is the\nenergy range where yet-unobserved resonances are predicted to lie [2].\nIn summary, we have given a brief overview of our\n~\u03b3 p \u2192 p\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 data, and we have demonstrated, by\nmeans of phenomenological models, the sensitivity of this\nhelicity-asymmetry observable to the dynamics of the reaction. The large amount of high-quality data that we\nhave obtained opens the path for a series of further investigations. Obvious next steps are (1) a better theoretical\nunderstanding of the reaction and (2) an attempt to describe simultaneously our polarized double-charged pion\nphotoproduction data and other CLAS data obtained\nwith unpolarized real [11] and virtual [9] photons.\nWe see, even from the small sample of data shown here,\nthat existing theoretical models have severe shortcomings\nin the description of the beam-helicity asymmetries. In\nthe region of overlapping nucleon resonances (and uncontrolled backgrounds), it clearly will be a challenge to any\ntheoretical model to describe this new observable that depends so sensitively on the interferences between them.\nYet, without a proper understanding of the \u03c0\u03c0N channel\nthe problem of the \"missing\" resonances is unlikely to be\nresolved.\nWe would like to thank the staff of the Accelerator and\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n\nDeceased\nCurrent address: Physikalisches Institut der Universit\u00e4t\nGiessen, 35392 Giessen, Germany\nS.
