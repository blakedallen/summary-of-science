Introduction\nBroad emission lines in quasars and in other types of active galaxies have lead to the identification\nof those objects as distant sources with strong non-stellar nuclear emission coming from their\nnuclei due to accretion onto black holes. Both Carl Seyfert (1943) [1] and Maarten Schmidt\n(1963) [2] in their seminal papers were just studying emission lines. Since that time there was a\ntremendous progress in our understanding of the nature of active galaxies and in our knowledge\nof the Broad Line Region (BLR) properties. Emission line measurements are also nowadays a\npowerful tool to measure the mass of the central black hole (Kaspi et al. [3]; Peterson et al. [4])\nand these measurements done for large samples of quasars (e.g. Vestergaard et al. [5]) give the\ninsight into the evolution of galaxies. But one question still remains to be answered: why this\nregion actually forms there.\nThe properties of the BLR contain a hidden hint. The argument goes through three\nindependent lines of reasoning.\n\n\fFirst point: The lines cover a considerable fraction (0.1 - 0.3) of an AGN sky from the point\nof view of the nucleus, as estimated from the line luminosity (ref. [6]). At the same time they are\nalmost never along the line of sight to the nucleus although NAL are seen in a significant fraction\nof objects (BAL are rare; 20% of normal quasars [7]) and both NAL and BAL form at larger\ndistances from the nucleus. There are rare reports of the transient absorption phenomenon seen\nin X-ray data which are likely to be due to BLR clouds [8]. These observations indicate that the\nBLR is not spherical but flat and located close to the equatorial plane; in side-viewed objects\nthis region is hidden from us by the dusty-molecular torus and in top-viewed objects the line of\nsights does not cross BLR. Kinetic arguments also suggest such a flattening (e.g. Nikolajuk [9],\nCollin [10]).\nSecond point: the line widths are from 1000 to 10 000 km s\u22121 , consistent with the Keplerian\ndisk-like motion. However, lines rarely show two-component profile expected from a flattened\ndisk-like configuration. There are rare objects showing clearly double-peaked lines but these\nare mostly radio-galaxies (Eracleous & Halpern [11]), and some objects hint for the disk-like\nprofiles in the variable part of their line profiles. The majority of quasars have a single peak.\nMurray & Chiang have shown that even a disk-like configuration can lead to single profiles but\nit requires special wind velocity profile [12]. And no systematic shift (outflow velocity signature)\nwith respect to the Narrow Line Region (NLR) is seen in Balmer lines.\nThird point: The careful studies of the luminosity and the line ratios, particularly in respects\nto the Low Ionization Lines like Balmer lines and Mg II (Collin-Souffrin [13]), suggest that\nadditional collisional heating is needed in addition to pure radiative heating estimated from the\nshape of the continuum emission from the central region of an active galaxy.\nAll three problems point towards the BLR as flat configuration roughly in Keplerian motion\nbut with additional turbulence with the turbulence velocities of order of a thousand km s\u22121 .\nSuch velocities, although only a fraction of the Keplerian speed would be 100 times higher\nthan the sound speed, and the development of a such highly supersonic turbulence is not easily\nexplained.\nIn our paper we offer the plausible mechanism which gives strict quantitative predictions\nwhere the LIL part of the BLR would form. Future high resolution observations will possibly\nresolve the BLR region and offer direct test of the proposed mechanism.\n2. Disk temperature underlying the BLR\nWe determine the effective temperature of the accretion disk atmosphere underlying the BLR\nusing the observational determination of the BLR radius from the reverberation method and\ncombine it with the Shakura-Sunyaev theory of accretion disks [14].\nThe scaling of the BLR with luminosity discovered by Kaspi et al. [3] has been studied by\nseveral authors (e.g. Peterson et al. [4]). Here we use the result of Bentz et al. [15], where the\nstarlight contamination was carefully removed. The power-law index in the scaling between the\nBLR size and the monochromatic luminosity in their analysis is consistent with 0.5 within the\nerrors. We thus fixed this slope at 0.5, and refitted their data again, obtaining the relation\nlog RBLR [H\u03b2] = 1.538 \u00b1 0.027 + 0.5 log L44,5100 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere RBLR [H\u03b2] is in light days and L44,5100 is the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\n\u00c5 measured in units of 1044 erg s\u22121 . The value 0.027 is the error in the best-fit vertical\nnormalization; the dispersion around the best fit is larger but still small at 0.21.\nWe assume that the disk is not strongly irradiated, and the outflow from the disk is not too\nstrong, so the simple theory of the alpha-disk (Shakura & Sunyaev [14]) applies. In this case,\nthe monochromatic flux at 5100 \u00c5 can be calculated from the model, if the black hole mass\nand the accretion rate are known. Taking the numerical formula of Tripp et al. [16] (corrected\n\n\ffor a factor-of-two error, Nikolajuk, private communication), we derive\nlog L44,5100 =\n\n2\nlog(M \u1e40 ) \u2212 43.8820 + log cos i,\n3\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the black hole mass, M , and the accretion rate, \u1e40 , are in g and g s\u22121 , respectively. This\nformula allows us to calculate the BLR radius from the Eq. 1, if the product of (M \u1e40 ) is known.\nFor completeness, we introduce a geometrical factor representing the effect of the inclination\nangle, i for the measured delay (for details, see Czerny & Hryniewicz [17]). This gives the\nrelation between the actual disk radius, r, and the measured delay of H\u03b2 line:\nr=\n\nRBLR [H\u03b2]\n1 + sin i\n\n(3)\n\nand we fix this factor adopting the average inclination i = 39.2\u25e6 after Lawrence & Elvis [18].\nThe Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk theory allows us to calculate the effective temperature\nof the disk at that radius as a function of the black hole mass and accretion rate\nTef f =\n\n3GM \u1e40\n8\u03c0r 3 \u03c3B\n\n!0.25\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c3B is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since BLR is far from the central black hole, the\ninner boundary effect can be neglected.\nWhen we combine Eqs. 1, 2, 3, and 4, the dependence on the unknown mass and accretion\nrate vanishes, and we obtain a single value for all the sources in the sample\nTef f = 995 \u00b1 74K,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the error reflects the error in the constant in Eq. 1. We stress that the resulting value\ndoes not depend either on the black hole mass or accretion rate. The value is universal, for all\nsources.\nThis value is interesting since it is close to the critical temperature at which the dust can\n1/2\nform. The distance is smaller than the distance to the dusty torus Rdust \u223c 0.4L45 pc (Nenkova\net al. [19]; where L45 stands for the bolometric luminosity in 1045 erg s\u22121 ) since in our case the\ntemperature results only from the local disk dissipation instead of the irradiation by the central\nparts of AGN.\n3. The mechanism of formation of the BLR\nThis uniform effective temperature of 1000 K of the disk underlying the onset of the BLR implies\nthat the dust present in the disk atmosphere is responsible for the phenomenon. The radiation\npressure acting on dusty atmosphere is very large, as it is known for example for Wolf-Rayet stars\nand the strong wind develops. However, unlike in stars, the further development of the wind\nis modified by two factors: gravitational attraction in disk geometry rises with the height and,\nmore importantly, the irradiation by the central parts of the accretion disk (UV) also rises very\nstrongly due to better geometrical exposure. The dust evaporates, the rising material looses the\nradiation pressure support and falls back onto the disk surface. Such a failed wind can account\nboth for the large additional turbulent velocity without any strong signature of outflow since\nboth outflow and inflow take place with comparable velocities, and for the additional heating,\nas the outflowing and infalling clumps collide.\nThis region is separate from the region known as dusty/molecular torus. At large distances\nthe UV irradiation is less important, the dust survives even at large height from the disk and\nthe outflow proceeds forming an appearance of a torus. The schematic representation of the\nBLR formation mechanism is shown in Fig 1.\n\n\fFigure 1. The schematic picture of the\nformation of BLR. In this region dusty\nwind rises up, the dust evaporates due to\nirradiation by the central parts, gravity wins\nand dustless material falls back onto the\ndisk. Dusty torus is further from the nucleus\nwhere irradiation does not destroy the dust.\n\nFigure 2. The dependence of the size of the\nBLR in NGC 5548 on the monochromatic\nluminosity: data points come from Bentz\net al. [15], and the best fit line has\nthe slope 0.90 \u00b1 0.22 in the logarithmic\nspace, instead of 0.5 characteristic for the\nstatistical sample.\n\n4. Discussion\nThe mechanism of BLR formation proposed in this paper and in Czerny & Hryniewicz [17] is\nattractive since it is universal for all sources, and the physics of dusty winds is known from\nstellar evolution. Although the possible presence of the dust in the BLR clouds was previously\ndiscussed by a number of authors, our idea of the key importance of the dust for BLR is new\nand should be further tested. The whole idea automatically explains why the size of the BLR\nregion scales with the square root of the monochromatic luminosity, with small dispersion, since\nno dependence on the second parameter - for example bolometric luminosity is expected. We\nexpect a weak dependence of the inclination angle but this also remains to be tested.\n4.1. Determination of the disk temperature in all monitored sources\nIn the paper by Czerny & Hryniewicz [17] we tested additionally the mechanism by determining\nthe disk BLR temperature for a number of sources which were carefully monitored for many\nyears (e.g. Peterson et al. [4]) and their luminosity was corrected for the starlight contribution\nat the basis of the HST data (Bentz et al. [15]). For all sources we obtain the temperature value\nclose to 1000 K. This is also the case for NGC 5548 monitored for 14 years.\nWe do not see any correlation between the accretion rate and the disk effective temperature\nat the onset of BLR in the objects for which the reverberation monitoring was performed.\nMechanism simply connecting the BLR distance with irradiation would likely contain the trend\nwith the bolometric luminosity which (in Shakura-Sunyaev model) rises faster with the accretion\nrate than the monochromatic luminosity.\n4.2. The role of the disk irradiation\nIn our approach to the description of the disk atmosphere underlying the BLR and to the\ndescription of the monochromatic flux we used the simple local stationary disk model of Shakura\n& Sunyaev. However, observations of AGN show that AGN are variable and this variability is\n\n\fa central point of the monitoring approach and the measurement of delays. It means not only\nthat the disk is not stationary, but it implies that non-local phenomena (irradiation of the outer\ndisk parts by the inner disk) are complicated by these time delays.\nThe measured time delays between the continua measured at UBV bands are typically of\norder of a day or less in Seyfert galaxies (see e.g. Sergeev et al. [20]), the major trends in optical\nluminosity are of order of tend-hundreds of days, and measured time delays of H\u03b2 line are of\norder of days (see compilation in Bentz et al. [15]). Both an outer and an inner disk are the\nsources of variability, as argued for example by Gaskell [21], and the perturbations in the outer\ndisk propagate mechanically inwards through the disk (sound waves, viscous propagation) while\nperturbations in the inner disk affects the outer disk through irradiation, and the timescale is\nthe light travel time. This complex situation can be roughly represented with two different\naccretion rates/luminosities: inner accretion rate visible through the monochromatic flux and\nresponsible for the current strength of irradiation and the outer accretion rate (past value, likely\ncloser to the average value) characteristic for the disk structure underlying the BLR.\nWe can now consider various possibilities depending on the importance of the irradiation on\nthe measured value.\nIf the whole idea of Czerny & Hryniewicz [17] is incorrect, and the dust formation in the\naccretion disk atmosphere has nothing to do with the formation of the BLR, then we return\nto the classical point of view that the onset of BLR requires a specific value of the ionization\nparameter. In this case the radius of the BLR should scale with the accretion rate at the inner\ndisk as\nRBLR \u221d \u1e40 1/2 .\n(6)\nIf we assume that the monochromatic flux is nevertheless dominated by the local dissipation,\ni.e. we can use Eq. 2, the final dependence between the monochromatic luminosity and the BLR\nradius will be\n\u22121/2\nRLBR \u221d L0.75\n,\n(7)\n5100 M\ni.e. the slope will be close to the older value and the presence of the additional dependence\non the black hole mass would be expected. For a given source, only the dependence on the\nmonochromatic luminosity matters, while in a sample of sources there is a likely bias towards\npositive correlation between the monochromatic luminosity and the mass, leading to much more\nshallow dependence.\nTherefore, we additionally plotted the results of the monitoring for NGC 5548, taking the\ndata points from Bentz et al. where the starlight was subtracted. The relation is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe slope is indeed steeper, equal to 0.90 \u00b1 0.22. The lower limit is consistent within the error\nwith the expectations based on the ionization parameter, but the value itself is surprisingly high.\nTherefore, we considered whether the dust based scenario can explain such a steep slope. If we\nfollow the general idea of Czerny & Hryniewicz [17] of dust onset of the BLR but we include\nthe irradiation of the disk surface we also obtain the dependence of the BLR position on the\naccretion rate at the inner disk. Assuming that the irradiation actually dominates we have\nFdisk =\n\nLbol h q\n\u03b3(\u03b3 \u2212 1),\n4\u03c0r 2 r\n\n(8)\n\nwhere h(r) is the disk thickness, and the radial dependence is in the form of a power law,\nh(r) \u221d r \u03b3 .\nLoska et al. [22] considered direct and indirect irradiation of an AGN accretion disk and\ncalculated the disk thickness of the non-irradiated and irradiated disk taking into account the\nvertical disk structure with convection and realistic opacities, with atomic transitions, molecules\nand dust. The disk thickness rises slowly with the radius at the inner part of the disk and then\nflares at larger distances, roughly as predicted by the original Shakura & Sunyaev model. The\n\n\fTable 1.

[22] is roughly with h \u221d r 1.25 (see their Fig. 3). If we supplement this\nvalue of \u03b3 into Eq. 8, assume the BLR location at a fixed temperature determined by the dust,\nand combine it with the expression for the monochromatic flux we obtain the expected scaling\n\u22120.57\nRBLR \u221d L0.86\n,\n5100 M\n\n(9)\n\ni.e. the trend with the black hole mass appears but the trend with the luminosity matches nicely\nthe one seen for NGC 5548.\nInstead, if the irradiation dominates at 5100 \u00c5 the spectrum has much flatter slope\n(F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22121 ) than in the Shakura-Sunyaev disk (F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd 1/3 ), and the monochromatic flux is\nproportional to the accretion rate, L5100 \u221d \u1e40 . In this case the combination of the irradiation\ndominating 5100 \u00c5 and the assumption of the specific value of the ionization parameter specified\nBLR gives the required relation for the statistical sample\nRBLR \u221d L0.5\n5100 ,\n\n(10)\n\nbut it is inconsistent with the trends observed in NGC 5548.\n4.3. Further tests of the model\nBetter tests of the idea that the dust is the key mechanism behind the formation of the BLR\nrequire both more results of the reverberation monitoring and better description of the actual\ndusty outflow.\nObservationally, results from many years for a single source would allow to see whether the\nsteeper relation seen for NGC 5548 is a typical pattern for a single source variability. Monitoring\n\n\fof more objects in a still broader range of masses and accretion rates would allow to test the\nexact form of coupling of the BLR size to the mass and accretion rate.\nDirect observational approach to the location of the BLR is not possible at present. The\nrequested spacial resolution is very high: the optimum source is NGC 4051 (100 \u03bcarcsec) due to\nits low redshift (see Table 1), but in the future even such an extreme resolution will be achieved.\nSuch a possibility was already envisioned by Elvis & Karovska [23].\nTheoretical studies are also needed since the actual formation of the dust in the disk\natmosphere, dusty outflow, dust/gas coupling, dust evaporation and subsequent inflow are very\ncomplex phenomena. There are papers addressing some of the issues (for example, see a recent\npaper of Dorodnitsyn et al. [24] about the dusty outflow forming the dusty torus), but never all\nof them. In addition, the dust may acquire charge, and the presence of the large scale magnetic\nfield may also modify the dust particle behaviour, (see e.g. Kovar et al. [25] for extreme examples\nof charges close to a black hole).\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by grant NN 203 380136.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n\nSeyfert, C.
