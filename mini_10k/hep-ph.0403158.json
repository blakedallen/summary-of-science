New\nlight particles with small couplings can be searched for in many different ways. Neutral fermions\nwith eV-scale mass, called 'sterile neutrinos' in the jargon, are typically stable enough to give\neffects in cosmology, and can affect neutrino oscillation experiments.1 Both fields recently discovered new physics (in both cases around meV energies), but so far no sterile neutrinos.\nToday the most powerful cosmological probe of sterile effects is standard Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) [1], which constrains the number of thermalized neutrinos present at T \u223c 0.1 MeV\n\n1\nSmall fermions masses are stable under quantum corrections. Cosmology, astrophysics and neutrino experiments are also sensitive to light scalars or vectors, which give different kinds of signals.\n\n1\n\n\fto be N\u03bd = 2.5 \u00b1 0.7. Since the uncertainty is controversial it is not clear how much N\u03bd = 4 is\ndisfavoured.\nThe established solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies seem produced by oscillations\namong the three SM neutrinos, with at most minor contributions from possible extra sterile\nneutrinos. The present 99% C.L. bounds on sterile mixing, computed assuming that the initial\nactive neutrino |\u03bda i oscillates with a large \u2206m2 into an energy-independent mixed neutrino\ncos \u03b8s |\u03bda\u2032 i + sin \u03b8s |\u03bds i, are sin2 \u03b8s < 0.25 in solar oscillations (where \u03bda = \u03bde ) [2] and sin2 \u03b8s < 0.21\nin atmospheric oscillations (where \u03bda = \u03bd\u03bc ) [3].\nWe relax these simplifying assumptions and study the more general 4-neutrino context. This\ndemands a remarkable effort, but it is an important task for the present, for two reasons. First,\nbecause recent discoveries in cosmology and neutrino physics are stimulating new experiments\nthat will study the new phenomena with the redundancy necessary to test the minimal models\nsuggested by present data. Second, because oscillations in extra light particles are the natural\nextension of the emergent massive neutrinos scenario.\nAlthough we list hints that might be interpreted as sterile neutrino effects (LSND [4], certain\npieces of solar or atmospheric or BBN data, ...), we do not focus on any of them in particular.\nRather, we compute experimental capabilities and constraints on sterile oscillations and compare\nthem with capabilities and constraints from various present and future cosmological and astrophysical probes. Some important constraints are based on untested assumptions and plagued\nby systematic uncertainties. In such cases, rather than performing global fits, we identify and\ncompute the key observables, trying to explain the basic physics in simple terms emphasizing\nthe controversial issues, so that the reader can judge.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we briefly review theoretical motivations: as\nin the case of the known light particles, some fundamental reason would presumably be behind\nthe lightness of an extra sterile neutrino. We also describe the non-standard parametrization\nof active/sterile mixing that we choose (because more convenient and intuitive than standard\nparametrizations) and describe the qualitatively different kinds of spectra on which we will focus.\nIn section 3 we study sterile effects in cosmology, comparing the relative sensitivities of\ntwo BBN probes (the helium-4 and deuterium abundances), of Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) and of Large Scale Structures (LSS). In section 4 we study sterile oscillations in solar\n(and KamLAND) neutrinos. In section 5 we study sterile oscillations in SN1987A and future\nsupernovae. We also briefly discuss other less promising probes (relic SN background, highenergy cosmic neutrinos,. . . ). In section 6 we study sterile oscillations in atmospheric and\nreactor neutrinos, and in short and long-baseline neutrino beams (including LSND).\nIn order to avoid a unreadably long paper each section is written in a concise way and\ncontains a 'Results' subsection, which can be read skipping the other more technical parts.\nFrom a computational point of view, exploring 4\u03bd oscillations is 3 \u00f7 4 orders of magnitude\nmore demanding than usual 2 or 3\u03bd fits and therefore requires significant improvements of usual\ntechniques. Subsections entitled 'technical details' describe how this was achieved. In particular\nwe describe how we employ the density matrix formalism in neutrino oscillation computations,\nand explain why even in simple 3\u03bd situations it gives significant advantages with respect to more\ndirect equivalent approaches.\nIn section 7 we conclude by summarizing and comparing the different probes of sterile neutrinos.\n2\n\n\f2\n\nActive/sterile neutrino mixing\n\nWe first introduce a non-standard useful parameterization of the most generic 4\u03bd spectrum, and\nlater present a brief review of theoretical models.\n\n2.1\n\nParameterization\n\nA generic 4 \u00d7 4 Majorana neutrino mass matrix is described by 4 masses, 6 mixing angles and\n6 CP-violating phases; 3 of them affect oscillations.\nIn absence of sterile neutrinos, we denote by U the usual 3 \u00d7 3 mixing matrix that relates\na\nneutrino flavour eigenstates \u03bde,\u03bc,\u03c4 to active neutrino mass eigenstates \u03bd1,2,3\nas \u03bdl = Uli \u03bdia (i =\n{1, 2, 3}, l = {e, \u03bc, \u03c4 }).

The sterile\nneutrino oscillates into a well defined flavour at 3 different \u2206m2 (which cannot all be\nsmaller than the observed splittings \u2206m2sun,atm ).\n\u2022 Mixing with a mass eigenstate (fig. 1b): ~n * ~\u03bd = \u03bdi (i = 1 or 2 or 3).2 The sterile\nneutrino oscillates into a neutrino of mixed flavour at a single \u2206m2 , which can be arbitrarily\nsmall.\n2\n\nFrom here on, we omit the superscript 'a' (that stands for active): it should be clear that whenever we speak\nof \u03bd2 /\u03bds mixing, this is just a short-hand for \u03bd2a /\u03bds .\n\n3\n\n\f\u03bd\u03bc /\u03bds mixing\ns\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03c4\n\u03bc\n\ne\n\n\u03bd2 /\u03bds mixing\ns\n\n\u03bd4\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bd3\n\u03c4\n\n\u03bd2\n\u03bd1\n\ne\n\n\u03bc\n\ne\ne\n\n\u03bd4\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03bd3\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03bd2\n\u03bd1\n\nFigure 1: Basic kinds of four neutrino mass spectra. Left: sterile mixing with a flavour\neigenstate (\u03bd\u03bc in the picture). Right: sterile mixing with a mass eigenstate (\u03bd2 in the picture).\nWe think that our parametrization of sterile mixing, in eq. (1), makes physics more transparent\nthan other frequently used choices3 .\nThe oscillation probabilities among active neutrinos in the limit where the active/sterile mass\nsplitting dominates, and active/active mass splittings can be neglected, are\nP (\u03bdl \u2192 \u03bdl\u2032 ) = P (\u03bd\u0304l \u2192 \u03bd\u0304l\u2032 ) =\n\n(\n\n1 \u2212 4|Vl42 |(1 \u2212 |Vl42 |) sin2 (\u2206m214 L/4E\u03bd ) for l = l\u2032\n4|Vl42 ||Vl2\u20324 | sin2 (\u2206m214 L/4E\u03bd )\nfor l 6= l\u2032\n\n(2)\n\nand in our parametrization Vl4 = n\u2217l sin \u03b8s .\nOlder papers studied active/sterile mixing in 2 neutrino approximation. In such a case\n\u03b8s = \u03c0/2 gives no oscillation effect. On the contrary, in the full 4 neutrino case \u03b8s = \u03c0/2 swaps\nthe sterile neutrino with one active neutrino. (e.g. \u03bd\u03bc in fig. 1a or \u03bd2 in fig. 1b, if \u03b8s were there\nincreased up to \u03c0/2) affecting solar and atmospheric oscillations in an obvious way. Therefore\nlarge active/sterile mixing is excluded by experiments for all values of \u2206m2i4 \u2261 m24 \u2212 m2i (with\none exception: the sterile neutrino mixes with a mass eigenstate \u03bdi and the two states form a\nquasi-degenerate pair. This structure arises naturally in certain models [5]).\nIn order to explore a more interesting slice of parameter space when considering sterile mixing\nwith a mass eigenstate \u03bdi , for \u03b8s > \u03c0/4 we modify the spectrum of neutrino masses and replace\n(m2i , m24 ) with (2m2i \u2212 m24 , m2i ). In such a way, the mostly active state always keeps the same\nsquared mass (that we fix to its experimental value), so that in the limit \u03b8s = \u03c0/2 the sterile\nneutrino gives no effect rather than giving an already excluded effect. Physically, in our \u03bds /\u03bdi\n3\n\nWhen studying sterile mixing with a flavour eigenstate our expression is directly related to the 'standard'\nparameterization\nV = R34 R24 R14 * U23 U13 U12\nwhere Rij represents a rotation in the ij plane by angle \u03b8ij and Uij a complex rotation in the ij plane. \u03b814 or\nUe4 gives rise to \u03bde /\u03bds mixing, \u03b824 or U\u03bc4 to \u03bd\u03bc /\u03bds mixing, and \u03b834 or U\u03c4 4 to \u03bd\u03c4 /\u03bds mixing.\nThe above 'standard' parameterization becomes inconvenient when studying mixing with a mass eigenstate.\nIn such a case our parameterization is directly related to the alternative 'standard' parameterization appropriate\nfor this case,\nV = U23 U13 U12 * R34 R24 R14\nNow \u03b8i4 gives rise to \u03bdi /\u03bds mixing. Our parameterization instead is convenient because it remains simple in both\ncases.\n\n4\n\n\fplots the mostly sterile neutrino is heavier (lighter) than the mass eigenstate \u03bdi to which it mixes\nwhen \u03b8s < \u03c0/4 (\u03b8s > \u03c0/4). When studying mixing with a flavour eigenstate we do not modify\nthe spectra at \u03b8s > \u03c0/4 in order to obtain some other experimentally allowed configuration. For\nthis reason, we restrict such plots to \u03b8s < \u03c0/4.\nWe do not consider '2 + 2' neutrino mixing, namely two neutrino couples separated by a\nmass splitting much larger than \u2206m2sun,atm . In fact this spectrum does not reduce to active-only\noscillations in any limiting case so that sterile effects are always sizable, and present experiments\nalready exclude this possibility [6]. When the separation among the two couples is comparable\nto \u2206m2sun,atm , '2 + 2' is no longer a special case qualitatively different from '3 + 1'.\nWe assume that active neutrinos have normal hierarchy, \u2206m223 > 0. Finally, we assume\n\u03b813 = 0. We verified that using \u03b813 \u223c 0.2, the maximal value allowed by present experiments,\nleads to minor (in some cases) or no (in other cases) modifications, that we do not discuss.\nMeasuring \u03b813 and discovering sterile effects will likely be two independent issues (however it is\ncurious to note that both could first manifest as disappearance of reactor \u03bd\u0304e ).\nThese assumptions are made because we consider three active neutrinos with normal hierarchy as the most plausible spectrum, and view inverted hierarchy, large \u03b813 and sterile neutrinos\nas possible surprises: we here study the latter one.\n\n2.2\n\nTheory\n\nThe relevant terms in the SU(2)L -invariant effective Lagrangian that describes active neutrinos\n\u03bd together with extra light singlet fermions \u03bdR are\nmRR 2 mLR\nmLL\n2\n(LH)\n+\n\u03bd +\n\u03bdR LH + h.c.\n(3)\n2v 2\n2 R\nv\nH is the higgs doublet with vacuum expectation value (0, v). The first dimension-5 operator\ngives Majorana \u03bd masses mLL and is naturally small if lepton number is broken at a high-energy\nscale. The second term gives Majorana \u03bdR masses mRR , and the third term Dirac \u03bdL \u03bdR masses\nmLR : one needs to understand why mLR and mRR are small.\nA few theoretically favoured patterns emerge from rather general naturalness considerations.\nWe consider the most generic mass matrix with LL, RR and LR mass terms. If mLL dominates\none obtains light sterile neutrinos with mass ms \u226a ma and active/sterile mixings \u03b8s2 \u223c ms /ma .\nIf mRR dominates sterile neutrinos are heavy with \u03b8s2 \u223c ma /ms . If mLR dominates one obtains\nquasi-Dirac neutrinos that split into couples. These 'more likely' regions can be represented as\nlines in the logarithmic (tan2 \u03b8s , \u2206m2i4 ) plane, that we will use to present our results.\nA new light particle would probably be a discovery of fundamental importance, because it\nlightness is likely related to some fundamental principle, as it is the case for the known light\nparticles, the photon, the neutrinos and the graviton. Attempts of guessing physics beyond the\nSM from first principles motivate a number of fermions which might have TeV2 /MPl masses and\nbehave as sterile neutrinos. A few candidates are, in alphabetic order, axino, branino, dilatino,\nfamilino, Goldstino, Majorino, modulino, radino. These ambitious approaches so far do not give\nuseful predictions on the flavour parameters in the effective Lagrangian of eq. (3). Therefore one\nneeds to consider more specific ad-hoc models [7].\nUnification of matter fermions into SO(10) 16 or E6 27 representations predicts extra singlets, which however generically receive GUT-scale masses. It is easy to invent ad-hoc discrete\n5\n\n\for continuous symmetries that keep a fermion light [7]. One might prefer to use only ingredients\nalready present in the SM. For example, the extra fermions can be forced to be light assuming\nthat they are chiral under some extra gauge symmetry (that could possibly become non perturbative at some QCD-like scale, and give composite sterile neutrinos) [7]. Alternatively, the extra\nfermions may be light for the same reason why neutrinos are light in the SM [7]. Following this\npoint of view up to its extreme, one can add to the SM a set of 'mirror particles', obtaining 3 sterile neutrinos [7]. In presence of Planck-suppressed corrections that mix the two sectors, mirror\nneutrinos with the same mass as SM neutrinos give rise to quasi-maximal mixing angles between\nSM neutrino mass eigenstates and sterile neutrinos, splitted by \u2206m2 \u223c mi v 2 /MPl \u223c 10\u22128 eV2\n(this kind of \u03bd2 /\u03bds effects are disfavoured by solar data). Mirror neutrinos with different masses\nfrom SM neutrinos can give detectable \u03bd1 /\u03bds oscillation effects. The two sectors might instead\ncommunicate because coupled to the same heavy see-saw neutrinos: this gives massless states\nwhich can be mostly sterile.\n\n3\n\nSterile effects in cosmology\n\nPresent cosmological data seem compatible with the following minimal assumption (see e.g. [8]):\nprimordial perturbations are generated by minimal inflation (flat space, Gaussian perturbations\nwith flat spectral index ns = 1) and evolve as dictated by general relativity (with a small\ncosmological constant) and by the Standard Model (adding some unknown Cold Dark Matter).\nGlobal analyses performed under this assumption give precise determinations of the cosmological\nparameters and bounds on non standard properties of neutrinos. In particular, the sensitivity\nto neutrino masses and to oscillations into extra sterile neutrinos is competitive with direct\nexperimental bounds.\nPresent bounds are unsafe because based on assumptions which have been only partially\ntested. At the level of precision needed to derive bounds on sterile neutrinos stronger than experimental bounds these assumptions stand practically untested. Since these bounds come from\na few key measurements (rather than from a redundant set of different observables) compensations among different kinds of new physics are not unnatural. For instance, the dominant BBN\nprobe [1], the helium-4 abundancy [9], is plagued by controversial systematic uncertainties, and\npresently it is not clearly incompatible with a fourth thermalized sterile neutrino [10]\nTherefore we do not try to attribute a precise probabilistic meaning to cosmological bounds\nby performing global fits. We prefer to identify and compute the key observables. This allows\nto present the underlying physics in a simple and critical way (while global fits would indirectly\ninvolve other cosmological parameters and data). The implications of present or future measurements can be read from our plots. Cosmology is interesting not only because gives indications\ntoday, but also because it will allow powerful future searches.\nBBN probes the total energy density at T \u223c (0.1 \u00f7 1) MeV (dominantly stored in electrons,\nphotons and neutrinos according to the SM) and is also directly sensitive to reactions involving\nneutrinos (e.g. \u03bd\u0304e p \u2194 \u0113n). Given a few input parameters (the effective number N\u03bd of thermalized relativistic species, the baryon asymmetry nB /n\u03b3 = \u03b7, and possibly the \u03bdl /\u03bd\u0304l lepton\nasymmetries) BBN successfully predicts the abundances of several light nuclei [1]. Its non trivial\nsuccess strongly indicates that primordial BBN really happened. Today \u03b7 is best determined\nwithin minimal cosmology by CMB data to be \u03b7 = (6.15 \u00b1 0.25)10\u221210 [8]. Thus, neglecting the\n6\n\n\flepton asymmetries (which is an excellent approximation unless they are much larger than the\nbaryon asymmetry) one can use the observations of primordial abundances to test if N\u03bd = 3 as\npredicted by the SM.\nToday the 4 He abundancy [9] is the most sensitive probe of N\u03bd . We study also the deuterium\nabundancy, that might have brighter prospects of future improvements [11]. For arbitrary values\nof N\u03bd around the SM value of 3, BBN predicts [1]\n\u03b7\n4\n+ 0.013(N\u03bd He \u2212 3),\n\u221210\n6.15 10\n1 + 0.11 (N\u03bdD \u2212 3)\n\u2243 (2.75 \u00b1 0.13) 10\u22125\n,\n(\u03b7/6.15 10\u221210 )1.6\n\nYp \u2243 0.248 + 0.0096 ln\n\n(4a)\n\nYD\nYH\n\n(4b)\n\nwhere Yp \u2261 n4 He /nB . Both Yp and YD are plagued by controversial systematic uncertainties. We\ndo not enter into these issues and refer the reader to [12, 13, 10, 9, 11]. Adopting conservative\nestimates we get\n4\nYp = 0.24 \u00b1 0.01\n\u21d2 N\u03bd He \u2243 2.4 \u00b1 0.7,\nYD\n(5)\n= (2.8 \u00b1 0.5) 10\u22125 \u21d2 N\u03bdD \u2243 3 \u00b1 2.\nYH\nIn order to safely test and possibly rule out N\u03bd = 4 it is necessary to either i) somewhat improve\nthe determination of Yp , or to ii) improve on YD , somewhat improve on \u03b7 and on the theoretical\nuncertainty on YD .\nIn our computation, we assume standard cosmology plus a sterile neutrino, and conservatively\nassume it has zero initial abundancy at T \u226b MeV. Oscillations produce sterile neutrinos [14].\nThis is a rather robust phenomenon: it is difficult to modify cosmology in order to avoid production of sterile neutrinos while keeping the success of BBN. In fact sterile neutrinos are dominantly\nproduced at T \u223c MeV, simultaneously or after neutrino decoupling.\nHowever, a neutrino asymmetry \u03b7\u03bd 8 orders of magnitude larger than \u03b7 in baryons is a\nsignificant extra parameter: it affects the \u03bde abundancy and consequently the n/p ratio at\nfreeze-out, and finally the primordial abundances. Also, a relatively large lepton asymmetry,\naround 10\u22125 , gives extra MSW effects which can suppress active/sterile oscillations removing\ncosmological signals [15]. More generically, allowing a non vanishing \u03b7\u03bd any N\u03bd is compatible\nwith the measurement of the helium-4 abundancy, just because a single measurement cannot fix\ntwo parameters (N\u03bd and \u03b7\u03bd ). It is important to study how the situation improves when also YD\nwill be precisely measured. For example increasing N\u03bd from 3 to 4 increases YD by 11% and Yp\nby 5%. If the latter effect were compensated by a large neutrino asymmetry, YD still remains\nabout 8% higher. Numbers can be somewhat different, depending on how N\u03bd gets dynamically\nincreased by sterile oscillations, which are also directly affected by a large neutrino asymmetry\nin an important way [15, 16]. However the general point remains. Of course one can make\nany N\u03bd allowed by just introducing more than one free parameter; but measuring two or more\nobservables would make hard to believe that new physics effects cancel among each other in all\ncases.\nIn the following we stick to standard cosmology.\nFor each choice of oscillation parameters, we follow the evolution with temperature of neutrino\nabundances and compute how Yp and YD are modified. For easy of presentation, we convert their\n4\nvalues into effective numbers of neutrinos, N\u03bd He and N\u03bdD , univocally defined by the inversion of\n7\n\n\feq. (4). These parameters do not necessarily lie between 3 and 4 and are employed just as a\nuseful way of presenting our final results.\nWe also compute another effective number of neutrinos, that parameterizes the total energy\ndensity in relativistic species at photon decoupling as4\n\u0014\n\n\u03c1relativistic = \u03c1\u03b3 1 +\n\n7 4\n8 11\n\u0012\n\n\u00134/3\n\n\u0015\n\nN\u03bdCMB .\n\n(6)\n\nThis quantity (together with other cosmological parameters) determines the pattern of fluctuations of the CMB measured by WMAP (and other experiments). Neutrinos affect CMB in\nvarious ways [17]; in the future studying how neutrino free-streaming shifts the acoustic peaks\nshould offer a clean way of directly counting neutrinos. Global fits at the moment imply [18]\nN\u03bdCMB \u2248 3 \u00b1 2\n\n(7)\n\nsomewhat depending on which priors and on which data are included in the fit. Future data\nmight start discriminating 3 from 4 neutrinos.\nFinally, neutrinos can be studied looking at distribution of galaxies because massive neutrinos move without interacting, making galaxies less clustered [19]. The effect depends on two\nparameters, that in absence of sterile neutrinos are both determined by neutrino masses: 1) the\ntemperature at which neutrinos become non relativistic, T\u03bd \u223c m\u03bd /3 (so that active neutrinos\noperated when the horizon of the universe had the size that clusters of galaxies have now); 2) the\nenergy density in neutrinos, \u03a9\u03bd h2 , that determines how large is the effect of neutrinos (neutrinos\ngive at most a minor correction). As usual, the parameter h is Htoday /(100km/s Mpc).\nGlobal analyses of cosmological data are usually reported as a bound on \u03a9\u03bd , assuming the\nstandard correlation with T\u03bd [8, 19]. However, in presence of a non-thermal population of sterile\nneutrinos these two parameters are no longer universally related. E.g. there could be a little\nnumber of sterile neutrinos with few eV mass (heavy neutrinos affect also CMB, behaving as\ncold dark matter). This scenario has not yet been compared with present data (see [20] for\nclosely related work). We assume that the bound can be approximated with the standard one\non the following quantity:5\nTr[m * \u03c1]\n\u03a9\u03bd h2 =\n(8)\n93.5 eV\nwhere m is the 4 \u00d7 4 neutrino mass matrix and \u03c1 is the 4 \u00d7 4 neutrino density matrix, as\ndiscussed below. We approximate the present bound with \u03a9\u03bd h2 < 0.01 (e.g. the WMAP global\nfit gives \u03a9\u03bd h2 < 0.76 10\u22122 at 95% C.L. in the standard case [8]. The bound becomes slightly\nweaker if N\u03bdCMB = 4, or if more conservative priors or estimates of systematic uncertainties are\n\u22123\nadopted [19]). The atmospheric mass splitting guarantees \u03a9\u03bd >\n\u223c 0.5 10 so that future attempts\nto reach this level of sensitivity are guaranteed. We assume that a 0.001 sensitivity in \u03a9\u03bd h2 will\nbe reached.\n4\n\nIncluding small effects of spectral distortions the precise SM prediction for the effective number of neutrinos\nis N\u03bdCMB = 3.04, but we can ignore this subtlety.\n5\nWe are neglecting CP-violation, and assuming that neutrinos and anti-neutrinos have equal density matrices.\n\n8\n\n\f3.1\n\nTechnical details\n\nBefore discussing results, we present the main technical details. In order to compute the observables discussed above one needs to set up the network of relevant Boltzmann equations and study\nneutrino oscillations in the early universe [21, 22]. We use our BBN code that includes all main\neffects, relying on more accurate public codes only to precisely fix the central SM values. This\nis a complicated computation because many processes proceed at T \u223c MeV: active (and maybe\nsterile) neutrino oscillations, neutrino decoupling, neutron decay, electron decoupling and finally\nnucleosynthesis. The various processes have been accurately studied in the past. The extension\nfrom 2 neutrinos oscillations to 4 neutrinos oscillations does not involve new ingredients, but\nrewriting and implementing old ones in an appropriate way is not completely trivial due to the\npresence e.g. of oscillations at different frequencies.\nBrute force alone would not allow to explore the key observables in a vast parameter space:\nit is necessary to employ accurate approximations that one can invent understanding the physics\nof BBN. Neglecting spectral distortions possibly induced by active/sterile oscillations, the Boltzmann equation for the 4 \u00d7 4 neutrino (and anti-neutrino) density matrix is [21, 22]\n\u03c1\u0307 = zZH\n\nd\u03c1\n= i[H , \u03c1] \u2212 {\u0393, (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1eq )}.\ndz\n\n(9)\n\nwhere H is the Hubble constant at temperature T , z = me /T . The factor Z = \u22123 d ln z/d ln s\n(where s is the entropy density) differs from 1 when the temperature of the universe does not\ndecrease as the inverse of its comoving radius, namely during electron decoupling (z \u223c 1) and\nwhen sterile neutrinos thermalize.

The usual MSW effect [23]\ngives an additional subdominant term with different sign for neutrinos and antineutrinos. The\naverage over the neutrino energy spectra is performed using a Fermi-Dirac distributions, and\ntherefore neglecting spectral distortions possibly caused by oscillations.\nIn eq. (9) we use the standard 'anticommutator' approximation for the collision terms \u0393, that\ndescribe weak \u03bde and \u03bd\u03bd interactions that tend to thermalize neutrinos, driving their matrix\ndensity to its thermal equilibrium value, \u03c1eq = diag(1, 1, 1, 0). A detailed comparison with the\nfull equations [22] reveals that they are accurately mimicked by inserting the following values of\nthe damping coefficients. In the equations for the off-diagonal components of \u03c1, we insert the\ntotal scattering rate [22]\n\u0393tot \u2248 3.6 G2F T 5\n\nfor \u03bde\n\nand\n\n\u0393tot \u2248 2.5 G2F T 5\n\nfor \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4\n\nbecause all scatterings damp the coherent interference between different flavours. In the equations for the diagonal components of \u03c1ii , we insert the annihilation rate [22]\n\u0393ann \u2248 0.5 G2F T 5\n\nfor \u03bde\n\nand\n\n\u0393ann \u2248 0.3 G2F T 5\n\nfor \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4\n\nsince annihilations are needed to change the number of neutrinos. However this procedure [22]\nintroduces an artificial choice of basis, giving equations which are no longer invariant under\n9\n\n\frotations in the (\u03bc, \u03c4 ) sector. In order to correctly maintain important coherencies among \u03bd\u03bc\nand \u03bd\u03c4 , we introduce the distinction between \u0393tot and \u0393ann in the \u03bd\u03bc \u00b1\u03bd\u03c4 basis (assuming maximal\natmospheric mixing; otherwise the generalization is immediate).\nAfter determining neutrino evolution we can study the relative n/p abundancy, that evolves\naccording to [1, 14]\n\u1e59 = zHZ\n\ndr\n= \u0393p\u2192n (1 \u2212 r) \u2212 r\u0393n\u2192p\ndz\n\nr=\n\nnn\nnn + np\n\nwhere \u0393p\u2192n is the total pe\u03bd\u0304e \u2192 n, pe \u2192 n\u03bde and p\u03bd\u0304e \u2192 n\u0113 reaction rate (in thermal equilibrium\nthe inverse process would satisfy \u0393n\u2192p = \u0393p\u2192n e(mn \u2212mp \u2212me )/T ). The production of sterile neutrinos affects n/p by [14] 1) increasing the Hubble parameter H; 2) modifying the \u0393p\u2192n , \u0393n\u2192p\nrates, if the \u03bde population is depleted by oscillations.\nFinally a network of Boltzmann equations describes how electroweak, strong and electromagnetic processes control the evolution of the various nuclei: p, n, D, T, 3 He, 4 He,. . . Rather\nthan recalling here the main features of these equations, we just state (without explanation) the\napproximation we use (see also [24]). At a sufficiently low temperature T \u2217 \u223c 0.08 MeV almost all\nneutrons wind up in 4 He, so that its mass abundancy is given by Yp \u2243 2r(T \u2217 ) with T \u2217 obtained\nsolving\n180H = \u0393DD\u2192pT (\u0393pn\u2192D\u03b3 /\u0393D\u03b3\u2192pn )2 .\nThe precise numerical value is fixed in such a way that in the SM case our simplified code\nprecisely agrees with state of the art codes (that include thermal, radiative and other corrections\ncorrections, smaller than the present experimental uncertainty).6 The deuterium abundancy is\nobtained with a similar technique.\n\n3.2\n\nResults\n\nWe plot the effective numbers N\u03bd of neutrinos defined in terms of the physical observables (the\nHe and D abundances and the energy density at recombination) from eq.s (4) and (6). We also\nplot the value of the present energy density in neutrinos \u03a9\u03bd , probed by observations of Large\nScale Structure together with CMB constraints.\n4\nThe plots have the following meaning: shaded regions have N\u03bd He > 3.8 or \u03a9\u03bd h2 > 10\u22122\nand are therefore 'disfavoured' or 'excluded' (depending on how conservatively one estimates\nsystematic uncertainties) within minimal cosmology. The other lines indicate the sensitivity\nthat future experiments might reach. More precisely we plot contour-lines corresponding to\nN\u03bd = 3.2 and 3.8 and to \u03a9\u03bd h2 = 10\u22122 and 10\u22123 .\n\n4\n\n6\n\nA recent paper [25] studied, in a four-neutrino context, how active/sterile oscillations affect the 4 He abundancy. The authors of [25] take into account spectral distortions of \u03bds (that we neglect), and neglects other\nminor corrections (that we include), such as those related to the electron mass. They compute an 'effective BBN\n4\nneutrino number' N\u03bdBBN , which, unlike our N\u03bd He and N\u03bdD , is not directly related to the observable helium-4\nand deuterium abundances. However, in the parameter range covered by their plots, their N\u03bdBBN should be an\n4\napproximation to N\u03bd He . The plots that can be compared show a reasonable level of agreement.\n2\n\u22128\nAt \u2206m \u223c 10 eV2 spectral distortions of electron neutrinos are not negligible: in the two-neutrino limit they\nmake the helium-4 abundancy more sensitive to sterile oscillations (see the papers by Kirilova et al. in [16]).\n\n10\n\n\f2\u03bd approximation: \u03bde /\u03bds\n\n102\n1\n\n10\u2212 2\n\n10\u2212 2\n\n\u2206 m2 in eV2\n\n\u2206 m2 in eV2\n\n10\u2212 4\n10\u2212 6\n10\u2212 8\n10\u2212 10 \u2212 6\n10\n10\u2212 4 10\u2212 2\n\n104\n\nN\n\n10\u2212 4\n10\u2212 6\n10\u2212 8\n\n1\n102\n2\ntan \u03b8\n\n\u03bd\n\n=\n\n1\n\n2\u03bd approximation: \u03bd\u03bc /\u03bds or \u03bd\u03c4 /\u03bds\n\n3.\n3. 8\n2\n\n102\n\n4\n\nHe\nD\nCMB\nLSS\n\n10\u2212 10 \u2212 6\n10\n10\u2212 4 10\u2212 2\n\n106\n\n1\n102\n2\ntan \u03b8\n\n104\n\n106\n\nFigure 2: Isocurves to the effective number of neutrinos produced by 2 neutrino oscillations in\nthe cases \u03bde /\u03bds (left plot) and \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 /\u03bds . Solar and atmospheric oscillations are included in the 3\nneutrino plots of fig. 3, where the meaning of the various isolines is precisely explained.\nIt is useful to start discussing the unrealistic but simple cases considered in old papers [14].\nIn fig. 2 we show the effects produced by 2 neutrino mixing: \u03bds /\u03bde in fig. 2a and \u03bds /\u03bd\u03bc or \u03bds /\u03bd\u03c4\nmixing in fig. 2b.7 The red dashed line shows the total number of neutrinos, N\u03bdCMB : it essentially\ndoes not depend on which flavour (\u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc or \u03bd\u03c4 ) mixes with \u03bds and is not affected by oscillations\n2\n\u22125\nwith \u2206m2 <\n\u223c 10 eV that are too slow and start only after neutrino decoupling, when the total\nnumber of neutrinos is frozen.8 At this stage neutrinos can still change flavour. The difference\nbetween fig. 2a and 2b is due to the fact that only electron neutrinos are involved in the reactions\nthat control the n/p ratio. Therefore \u03bds /\u03bde oscillations that occur after neutrino freeze-out and\nthat do not affect the total number of neutrinos (\u03bds are created by depleting \u03bde ) affect n/p and\nconsequently the 4 He abundancy9 (continuous line) [14] and, to a lesser extent, the D abundancy.\n2\n\u22128\nThis happens down to \u2206m2 \u223c 10\u22128 eV2 : oscillations with \u2206m2 <\n\u223c 10 eV occur after decoupling\nof electroweak scatterings, when the relative n/p abundancy is only affected by neutron decay.\nEffects are larger at \u03b8 > \u03c0/4 (i.e. tan \u03b8 > 1) because this corresponds to having a mostly\nsterile state lighter than the mostly active state, giving rise to MSW resonances in neutrinos\nand anti-neutrinos (like in cosmology, also supernova \u03bd\u0304e feel a MSW resonance for \u03b8s >\n\u223c \u03c0/4.\n7\n\nPrevious papers studied the 4 He abundancy and we agree with their results. We however use as a variable\ntan \u03b8 rather than sin2 2\u03b8, so that we unify in a unique plot the non-resonant (0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/4) and the resonant\n(\u03c0/4 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/2) case.\n8\nTo be precise we should say 'the total entropy in neutrinos per comoving volume remains constant'. For\nsimplicity we will adopt such loose abbreviations.\n4\n9\nThese region are strongly disfavoured because have a helium-4 abundancy corresponding to N\u03bd He > 4, up to\nabout 5.\n2\n\n11\n\n\f\u03bd1 /\u03bds\n\n102\n\n\u03bd2 /\u03bds\n\n1\n\n10\u2212 2\n\n10\u2212 2\n\n10\u2212 2\n\n10\u2212 6\n10\u2212 8\n10\u2212 10\n10\u2212 6 10\u2212 4 10\u2212 2\n\n10\n\n\u2206 m234 in eV2\n\n1\n\n10\u2212 4\n\n10\u2212 4\n10\u2212 6\n\n10\u2212 10\n10\u2212 6 10\u2212 4 10\u2212 2\n\n10\u2212 4\n10\u2212 6\n10\u2212 8\n\n10\u2212 8\n1 102 104 106\ntan2 \u03b8s\n\n10\u2212 10\n10\u2212 6 10\u2212 4 10\u2212 2\n\n1 102 104 106\ntan2 \u03b8\n\n\u03bde /\u03bds\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n\u03bd\u03bc /\u03bds or \u03bd\u03c4 /\u03bds\n\nDeuterium\nCMB\n\n10\u2212 4\n10\u2212 5\n\n\u22121\n\nHelium\n\n10\u2212 3\n\n10\u2212 6 \u2212 6\n10 10\u2212 5 10\u2212 4 10\u2212 3 10\u2212 2 10\u2212 1\ntan2 \u03b8s\n\n1 102 104 106\ntan2 \u03b8\n\n1\n4\n\n\u22121\n\nLSS\n\n\u2206 m214 in eV2\n\n\u2206 m214 in eV2\n\n1\n10\n\n\u03bd3 /\u03bds\n\n102\n\n1\n\u2206 m224 in eV2\n\n\u2206 m214 in eV2\n\n102\n\n10\n\n10\u2212 2\n10\u2212 3\n10\u2212 4\n10\u2212 5\n10\u2212 6 \u2212 6\n10 10\u2212 5 10\u2212 4 10\u2212 3 10\u2212 2 10\u2212 1\ntan2 \u03b8s\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFigure 3: Cosmological effects of sterile neutrino oscillations. We compare four different\nsignals. The continuous red line refers to the 4 He abundancy (we shaded as 'disfavoured' regions\nwhere its value corresponds to N\u03bd > 3.8), the violet dotted line to the deuterium abundancy, and\nthe dashed blue line to the effective number of neutrinos at recombination. We plotted isolines\nof these three signals corresponding to an effective number of neutrinos N\u03bd = 3.2 and 3.8. The\nprecise meaning of the parameter N\u03bd in the three cases is explained in the text. The upper\n(lower) dot-dashed orange lines corresponds to \u03a9\u03bd h2 = 10\u22122 (10\u22123 ), where \u03a9\u03bd is the present\nenergy density in neutrinos.\n\n12\n\n\fOn the contrary solar neutrinos feel a resonance for \u03b8s <\n\u223c \u03c0/4). In the past years it has been\ndebated about if a neutrino asymmetry and/or large inhomogeneity develop as a consequence\nof non-linear effects, and this issue has not yet been fully clarified. Our Boltzmann equations\nassume that both these effects can be neglected. At tan \u03b8 > 1 the bound from \u03a9\u03bd holds even for\nvery small mixing, \u03b8 \u2243 \u03c0/2 just because these region correspond to heavy active neutrinos.\nWe now discuss how the above picture changes taking into account oscillations among active\nneutrinos. Our results are shown in fig. 3: the upper row refers to sterile mixing with mass\neigenstates \u03bd1,2,3 and the lower row to mixing with flavour eigenstates \u03bde and \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 .\nAn inspection of the upper row shows that their main features can be understood in terms\nof the (unrealistic) results in the case of 2 neutrino mixing, fig. 2. Having assumed \u03b813 = 0,\n4\u03bd sterile mixing with \u03bd3 gives no new effects with respect to 2\u03bd sterile mixing with \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 . Due\nto solar and atmospheric oscillations, \u03bde depletion due to oscillations into sterile neutrinos now\nhappens in all other cases and becomes milder, because no longer confined to \u03bde but shared\namong all active neutrinos. Fig. 3b shows the effects of \u03bds /\u03bd2 mixing (this kind of neutrino\nspectrum is plotted in fig. 1b): since \u03bd2 contains some \u03bde component, electron neutrinos are in\npart directly affected. Fig. 3a shows the effects of \u03bds /\u03bd1 mixing: \u03bde depletion effects are largest in\nthis last case because \u03bd1 is the neutrino eigenstate with the largest \u03bde component. In summary:\ndepletion gets transferred to all \u03bd flavours and diluted.\nMixing with flavour eigenstates is qualitatively different, for the general reasons explained in\nsection 2. We can see the effects of the solar (atmospheric) mass splitting as bumps in fig. 3d\n(3e) where cosmological effects of \u03bds /\u03bde (\u03bds /\u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 ) mixing are computed. In the case of \u03bds /\u03bde\nmixing N\u03bdD , N\u03bdCMB = 4 is reached only if the sterile neutrino has a large enough \u2206m2 : the solar\n\u2206m2sun \u2248 0.7 10\u22124 eV2 alone is not sufficient, as also indicated by the 2\u03bd limit plotted in fig. 2a.\nOn the contrary, fig. 2b shows that in the case of \u03bds /\u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 mixing a \u2206m2 \u223c \u2206m2atm \u2248 2 10\u22123 eV2\nis large enough to reach N\u03bd \u2248 4 for any value of the sterile mass. We have verified that setting\n\u03b813 \u223c 0.2 fig.s 3 do not vary in a significant way.\n\n3.3\n\nHints and anomalies: cosmology\n\nTo conclude we list cosmological data that do not fit well into the scheme presently considered\nas standard, and that can be interpreted as manifestations of sterile neutrino effects:\n\u2022 Various determinations of the primordial helium-4 abundancy Yp try to reduce uncertainties by appropriately choosing and modeling the astrophysical systems used for the\nobservation [9]. Some analyses find lower values of Yp corresponding to less than 3 neutrinos (an effect which could come from active-sterile oscillations), even after a detailed\nexamination of the systematic uncertainties. Other determinations give higher values of\nYp , more compatible with N\u03bd = 3.\n\u2022 X-ray cluster data seem to prefer a lower value of the parameter \u03c38 than the other sets of\nCMB and LSS data, considered in [8, 19]. A degenerate spectrum of active neutrinos can\nalleviate this discrepancy [26]. Otherwise, one can invoke a contribution to \u03a9\u03bd from sterile\nneutrinos.\n\n13\n\n\f\u2022 Decays of sterile neutrinos with mass \u223c 200 MeV provide an interpretation of the reionization at large redshift observed by WMAP, alternative to the standard one (early formation\nof massive stars) [27].\n\u2022 Decays of sterile neutrinos with mass \u223c 10 MeV and abundancy \u03a9\u03bd = 10\u22125\u00f79 can be a non\nstandard source of recently observed galactic positrons [28].\n\n4\n\nSterile effects in solar (and KamLAND) neutrinos\n\nWe compare sterile effects with present and future solar neutrino experiments and with KamLAND reactor anti-neutrino data. While computing sterile effects in reactor \u03bd\u0304e is straightforward,\nsolar neutrinos are detected after a long trip from the center of the sun during which they can\nexperience sterile effects in several different ways. This is what makes solar neutrinos a powerful probe of sterile effects. In section 4.1 we describe how we precisely compute these effects.\nSection 4.2 describes how we fit data, dealing with the complication that these data contain\na positive evidence for active/active oscillations. Results and a qualitative understanding are\npresented in section 4.3. In section 4.5 we compare our results with previous analyses performed\nin limiting cases.\n\n4.1\n\nTechnical details\n\nIn order to understand what happens when a sterile neutrino is added and to write a sufficiently\nfast numerical code, we must develop an analytical approximation. It is convenient to employ\nsome more formalism than in the 2 \u00d7 2 case and study the evolution of the 4 \u00d7 4 neutrino\ndensity matrix \u03c1m written in the mass basis of instantaneous mass eigenstates. A \u03bde produced\nwith energy E\u03bd at radius r = r0 inside the sun is described by \u03c1m = Vm\u2020 * diag (1, 0, 0, 0) * Vm\nwhere Vm depends on E\u03bd and r0 . Mixing matrices in matter (Vm ) and vacuum (V ) are computed\ndiagonalizing the Hamiltonian [23]\nH =\n\nmm\u2020 \u221a\nNn Nn Nn\n+ 2GF diag (Ne \u2212\n, \u2212 , \u2212 , 0)\n2E\u03bd\n2\n2\n2\n\nand ordering eigenstates according to their eigenvalues Hi \u2261 m2\u03bdmi /2E\u03bd : \u03bdm1 (\u03bdm4 ) is the lightest\n(heaviest) neutrino mass eigenstate in matter. The evolution up to the detection point is described by a 4\u00d74 unitary evolution matrix U so that at detection point the density matrix in the\nbasis of flavour eigenstates is \u03c1 = hV * U * \u03c1m (r, E\u03bd ) * U \u2020 * V \u2020 i. where h* * *i denotes average over\nthe production point. The various observables involve additional averages over neutrino energy\nand time (and consequently over different paths in the earth and in vacuum). The oscillation\nprobabilities are given by P (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bde ) = \u03c1ee , P (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bds ) = \u03c1ss , etc.\nWe briefly describe the main steps in the computation of U , focussing on the subtle ones.\nThe evolution matrix can be decomposed as\nU = Uearth * Uvacuum * Usun .\nEvolution in vacuum is given by Uvacuum = diag exp(\u2212iLm2\u03bdi /2E\u03bd ). Combined with average\nover neutrino energy it suppresses the off-diagonal element \u03c1ij\nm when the phase differences among\neigenstates i and j are large.\n14\n\n\fEvolution in the earth is computed in mantle/core approximation, improved by using the\naverage density appropriate for each trajectory as predicted in [29]. Therefore we use Uearth = 1\nwhen the earth is not crossed, Uearth = P * diag exp(\u2212iLmantle m2\u03bdmi /2E\u03bd ) * P \u2020 when only the\nmantle is crossed (for a length Lmantle ), and the obvious generalization when both mantle and\ncore are crossed. P = VB\u2020 VA is a non-adiabaticity factor that takes into account the sharp flavour\nvariation of mass eigenstates when passing from medium A (vacuum) into medium B (the earth\nmantle) .\nEvolution in the sun is more complicated because there can be various P factors at nonadiabatic level crossings at radii rn (n = 1, 2, . . . , nmax ), that give\nUsun\n\n= Prn * * * Pr2 * diag exp(\u2212i\n\nZ\n\nr2\n\nr1\n\nZ r1\nm2\u03bdmi\nm2\u03bdmi\nds\n) * Pr1 * diag exp(\u2212i\n)\nds\n2E\u03bd\n2E\u03bd\nr0\n\nThe number of level crossings nmax ranges between 0 and a few, e.g. a \u03bde produced in the side\nof the sun farther from us can experience 4 crossings. When levels i and j cross in an adiabatic\nway, Prn = 1. If instead level crossing is fully non adiabatic Prn = Vm\u2020 (r <\n\u223c rn ) * Vm (r >\n\u223c rn )\n\u25e6\nis a rotation with angle \u03b1 = 90 in the (ij) plane. In general the rotation angle is given by\ntan2 \u03b1 = PC /(1 \u2212 PC ), where PC is the level crossing probability.\n\nSo far we only presented the well known formalism [23, 30, 31] in a non standard way appropriate for applying it in numerical computations with multiple and overlapping level crossings.\nWe now need to compute PC . This last step turns out to be non trivial. By generalizing well\nknown results valid in the simpler 2 \u00d7 2 case [30, 31], we find that in all the parameter range PC\ncan be accurately approximated analytically (i.e. no need of numerically solving the differential\nneutrino evolution equation i d\u03c1/ds = [H , \u03c1]). Such a simple result is possible because, in the\nrelevant neutrino energy range, level crossings are non adiabatic only for \u03b8s2 * \u2206m2 /10\u22128 eV2 \u226b 1\ni.e. when either \u03b8 is small or the active/sterile \u2206m2 is much smaller than the LMA splitting.\nTo compute PC it is convenient to consider the basis of mass eigenstates in absence of\nactive/sterile mixing (i.e. \u03b8s \u2192 0 or \u03b8s \u2192 \u03c0/2, depending on which limit is closer to the value\nof \u03b8s under examination. Here we focus on \u03b8s \u2192 0.). This limit allows to precisely define levelcrossings. When \u03bds crosses one of the active eigenstates, \u03bdam (a = 1, 2, 3) (see fig. 1a for one\nexample), the level crossing probability PC is well approximated by\n2\n\nm\n\ne\u03b3\u0303 cos \u03b8as \u2212 1\nPC =\ne\u03b3\u0303 \u2212 1\n\n\u03b3=\n\nm\n4Has2\nsin2 2\u03b8as\n\u2261 \u03b3\u0303 *\nm|\ndHa /dr\n2\u03c0| cos 2\u03b8as\n\nwhere\n\nm\nsin \u03b8as\n= ~n * ~\u03bdam sin \u03b8s .\n\n(11)\n\nThe above equation might seem a complicated way of rewriting the well known expression for\nPC valid in the simpler 2\u03bd case [30, 31], but there is one important difference. In the 2\u03bd case\none can write the result in an analogous way, which contains the mixing angle in vacuum and\nm\nthe off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian in vacuum. On the contrary, our \u03b3 and \u03b8as\nmust be\ncomputed around the resonance, where Haa = Hss (or around the point where adiabaticity is\nmaximally violated, in cases where there is no resonance). We emphasize that reducing the full\n4\u00d74 Hamiltonian to the effective 2\u00d72 Hamiltonian of the 2 states that cross and computing Has\nis non trivial, since sterile mixing sometimes redefines the flavour of the active neutrino involved\nin the crossing.10 In these situations it is useful to know the physical meaning of 2Has : it is the\n10\n\nNeglecting this subtlety would give a qualitatively wrong result e.g. in the following situation: \u03bds is mixed\nwith \u03bde and is quasi degenerate to \u03bd1 .\n\n15\n\n\f10\u2212 3\n\n\u2206 m 2sun in eV2\n\n\u2206 m2sun in eV2\n\n10\u2212 3\n\n10\u2212 4\n\n10\u2212 4\n\nSolar \u03bd and reactor \u2212\u03bd\u2212\n90, 99, 99.73 % CL\n\nSolar \u03bd\n90, 99, 99.73 % CL\n10\u2212 5\n0.1\n\n0.3\ntan2 \u03b8sun\n\n10\u2212 5\n10\u2212 1\n\n1\n\n1\ntan \u03b8sun\n2\n\nFigure 4: We compare the usual 'active only' global fit of solar (shaded regions in the left plot) and\nof solar plus KamLAND data (shaded regions in the right plot), with the Gaussian approximation\nemployed in this paper (dashed lines)\nminimal difference between the eigenvalues of the two states that cross.

(11) reduces to a Landau-Zener form PC \u2243 e\u2212\u03c0\u03b3/2 : our expression for the\nm\nadiabaticity factor \u03b3 holds for a generic 2 \u00d7 2 Hamiltonian. In the sun, resonances with \u03b8as\nclose\nto \u03c0/4 happen only in the quasi-vacuum region at the border of the sun. This will be no longer\ntrue when studying supernova neutrinos, that will necessitate an extension of eq. (11).\n\n4.2\n\nExperimental data and fit procedure\n\nWe fit all available latest data:\n\u2022 The SNO CC+NC+ES spectra [32], divided in 34 bins (17 energy bins times 2 day/night\nbins).\n\u2022 The total CC, NC and ES rates measured by SNO with enhanced NC sensitivity [33].\n\u2022 The Super-Kamiokande ES spectra [34], divided in 44 zenith-angle and energy bins.\n\u2022 The Gallium rate [35], RGa = (68.0 \u00b1 3.8) SNU, obtained averaging the most recent SAGE,\nGallex and GNO data.\n16\n\n\f\u2022 The Chlorine rate [36], RCl = (2.56 \u00b1 0.23) SNU.\n\u2022 The KamLAND reactor anti-neutrino data, divided in 13 energy bins with prompt energy\nhigher than 2.6 MeV [37].\nWe revised solar model predictions and uncertainties [38] including the recent measurement of\nthe 14 N(p, \u03b3)15 O nuclear cross section [39], which reduces the predicted CNO fluxes by roughly\n50%.\nData are compared with predictions forming a \u03c72 that takes into account statistical, systematic and theoretical uncertainties (on the total solar neutrino fluxes and on the 8 B spectrum)\nand their correlations [38]. We plot the \u03c72 as function of the 2 parameters that describe sterile\noscillations, marginalizing the full \u03c72 with respect to all other sources of uncertainty including\nthe LMA parameters \u2206m2sun and \u03b8sun . This step is of course not performed in usual analyses.\nProceeding in a fully numerical way, it would be too demanding for present computers. We\ncan however approximate all observables with a first order Taylor expansion around the best-fit\nLMA point, since experiments allow only relatively minor shifts from it. In this way marginalization over \u2206m212 and \u03b8sun can be performed analytically, using the same Gaussian techniques\ncommonly employed for other 'systematic' parameters. Fig.a 4 shows that performing this linearization (dashed lines) we obtain a satisfactory approximation to the usual active-only global\nfit of solar neutrinos (continuous lines). With more data this approximation will become more\nand more accurate.\nSolar \u03bd and reactor \u03bd\u0304 data cannot be fit independently, since both sets of data depend on\nsolar oscillation parameters. Inclusion of KamLAND data presents a slight complication: due to\npoor statistics, the Poissonian distribution must be used. Nevertheless small deviations from the\nLMA best fit (due to sterile effects and to systematic uncertainties) can be taken into account\nin Gaussian approximation, obtaining\n\u03c72 = 2(t \u2212 r ln t) \u2243 2(t0 \u2212 r ln t0 ) + 2\u01eb(t0 \u2212 r) + r\u01eb2\nwhere r are the observed rates and t = t0 (1 + \u01eb) the predicted rates. In our analysis \u01eb is the\ncorrection due to sterile neutrinos. Fig. 4b shows that we can accurately analytically approximate\nthe usual active-only global fit of solar plus KamLAND data.\n\n4.3\n\nResults\n\nWe start recalling how LMA oscillations behave in absence of sterile neutrinos [23]. Fig. 5a\nshows the composition of the two neutrino mass eigenstates. For sake of illustration we assumed\nnormal hierarchy, m21 \u226a m22 \u2243 \u2206m2sun \u226a m23 \u2243 \u2206m2atm . At higher neutrino energies,\nE\u03bd \u226b E\u2217 \u2248 \u2206m2sun /GF Nesun \u223c few MeV,\nmatter effects dominate around the center of the sun, r <\n\u223c 0.2Rsun where neutrinos are produced\nas \u03bde \u2248 \u03bd2m . The LMA level crossing at r \u2248 0.2Rsun is adiabatic (in fact the solar mixing angle\n\u03b8sun is so large that fig. 5 does not look like a level crossing) so that neutrinos produced as \u03bd2m\nexit from the sun as \u03bd2 = sin \u03b8sun \u03bde + cos \u03b8sun \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 i.e. Pee = sin2 \u03b8sun . This limit roughly holds\nat energies probed by SNO and SK: e.g. their total rate is Pee \u2248 1.15 sin2 \u03b8sun . At E\u03bd <\n\u223c E\u2217 Pee\nincreases and \u03bd1m contains some \u03bde because matter effects are no longer dominant.

The right plot shows qualitatively the effective anti-neutrino\nmasses in a supernova. The left plot shows the effective neutrino masses in the sun. We assumed hierarchical active neutrinos (i.e. m1 = 0 and m2 = (\u2206m2sun )1/2 ) and plotted the two\nmatter eigenstates that give rise to LMA oscillations for two different values of E\u03bd : 10 MeV and\n0.86 MeV, the energy of the main Beryllium line. Colors indicate the flavour composition. An\nextra sterile neutrino with small mixing is represented by an horizontal line with height equal to\nits mass.\nmatter effects are negligible and one gets averaged vacuum oscillations, Pee = 1 \u2212 12 sin2 2\u03b8sun .\nThis energy range has been explored by Gallium experiments.\nWe now discuss how to understand qualitatively the sterile/active mixing effects [23]. If\nsterile/active mixing is small, the mostly \u03bds state is represented by adding one quasi-horizontal\nline to fig. 5a. Depending on its height (determined by the mass of the sterile neutrino) the\nmostly sterile level crosses one or none of the two mostly active neutrinos (for all relevant neutrino\nenergies the sterile state does not cross both active neutrinos) after or before the LMA resonance\n(or after and before). In each case one can understand the behavior of the survival probabilities\nfrom the level-crossing scheme: in the example plotted in fig. 5a a neutrino produced at r0 \u2248 0.2\nexperiences a single level crossing at r1 \u2248 0.3. This example corresponds to the case considered\nin [40]: a sterile neutrino weakly mixed with \u03bd1 , with mass splitting \u2206m214 somewhat smaller\nthan \u2206m212 . A solar \u03bde produced at r \u223c 0.2Rsun contains a \u03bd1m component that crosses the \u03bds\nstate once, getting partially converted into \u03bds . This gives a dip in the survival probability at\nintermediate energies: at low energies one has averaged vacuum oscillations (negligibly affected\nby the small sterile mixing angle), at high energies matter effects dominate so that \u03bde \u2243 \u03bd2m that\ndoes not cross the sterile level. Fig. 7A,B show examples of this behavior. Even sticking to the\ncase of \u03bds /\u03bd1 mixing, qualitatively different effects are present for other values of the oscillation\nparameters, studied in fig. 6a. E.g. the example in fig. 7D illustrates the case discussed in [41, 7]:\n18\n\n\f\u03bds /\u03bd1\n\n10\u2212 2\n10\u2212 3\n\n10\u2212 3\n\n10\u2212 4\n\n10\u2212 4\nB\n\n10\u2212 6\n10\u2212 7\n\n10\u2212 5\n\nA\n\u2206 m 224 in eV2\n\n\u2206 m 214 in eV2\n\n10\u2212 5\n\nC\n\n\u22128\n\n10\n\n10\u2212 9\n10\u2212 10\n\n10\u2212 7\n10\u2212 8\n10\u2212 9\n10\u2212 11\n\nD\n\n10\u2212 12\n\n10\u2212 12\n\n\u2212 13\n\n\u2212 13\n\n10\n\n10\u2212 6 10\u2212 5 10\u2212 4 10\u2212 3 10\u2212 2 10\u2212 1\ntan2 \u03b8s\n\n1\n\n10\n\n102\n\n\u03bds /\u03bde\n\n10\u2212 2\n\n10\u2212 6 10\u2212 5 10\u2212 4 10\u2212 3 10\u2212 2 10\u2212 1\ntan2 \u03b8s\n\n10\u2212 3\n\n10\u2212 3\n\n10\u2212 4\n\n10\u2212 4\n\n10\u2212 5\n\n10\u2212 5\n\n10\u2212 6\n\n10\u2212 6\n\n10\u2212 7\n\u22128\n\n10\n\n10\u2212 9\n\n10\u2212 11\n\n10\u2212 12\n\n10\u2212 12\n10\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\ntan2 \u03b8s\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n10\u2212 13\n10\u2212 6\n\n1\n\n10\u2212 1\n\n1\n\n\u03bds /\u03bd\u03bc\n\n10\u2212 9\n\n10\u2212 11\n\n\u22124\n\n102\n\n10\u2212 8\n10\u2212 10\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\u2212 7\n\n10\u2212 10\n\n10\u2212 13\n10\u2212 6\n\nE\n\n10\u2212 2\n\n\u2206 m 214 in eV2\n\n\u2206 m 214 in eV2\n\n10\u2212 6\n\n10\u2212 10\n\n10\u2212 11\n10\n\n\u03bds /\u03bd2\n\n10\u2212 2\n\nF\n\n10\u2212 5\n\n10\u2212 4\n\n10\u2212 3\ntan2 \u03b8s\n\n10\u2212 2\n\nFigure 6: Sterile mixing: effects in solar neutrinos.

We plot, as function\nof the neutrino energy, P (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bde ) (decreasing red curve), P (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 ) (increasing blue curve)\nand P (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bds ) (lower black curve). The continuous (dotted) curve are the values during day\n(night). The sample points A,. . . , F are drawn in fig. 6 as dots.\nlarge \u03b8s and small \u2206m214 \u223c 10\u221212 eV2 . In all these examples sterile neutrinos manifest at low\nenergy, E\u03bd <\n\u223c E\u2217 . There is a general reason for this behavior: in absence of sterile effects, only\nat such energies LMA oscillations allow a \u03bd1 component in the solar neutrino flux.\nWe also consider a sterile neutrino mixed with \u03bd2 or \u03bd3 . \u03bds /\u03bd1 mixing and \u03bds /\u03bd2 mixing affect\nsolar neutrinos in similar ways. In fact the \u03bd1m and \u03bd2m neutrino eigenstates in matter both\ntypically contain significant \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 components. There are some differences in O(1) factors,\nwhich produce the difference between fig. 6a (\u03bds /\u03bd1 ) and b (\u03bds /\u03bd2 ). The most evident difference\nin the shape of the excluded region is due to our choice of the parameterization: when studying\n\u03bds /\u03bd2 mixing we produce plots with \u2206m224 on the vertical axis, so that small values of \u2206m224\ncorrespond to \u03bds quasi-degenerate with \u03bd2 (rather than with \u03bd1 ).\nA sterile neutrino mixed with \u03bd3 gives much smaller effects in solar neutrinos, so that we do\nnot show the corresponding plot. This happens because matter effects negligibly mix \u03bd3 with\n\u03bd1m or \u03bd2m , so that MSW resonances are highly non adiabatic i.e. ineffective.11\nAs discussed in section 2, sterile mixing with one active mass eigenstate is a special configuration. Therefore we also consider a sterile neutrino mixed with a flavour eigenstate: \u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc or\n\u03bd\u03c4 . In such a case there are active/sterile oscillations at multiple \u2206m2 values, which (in view\nof the observed mass differences among active neutrinos) cannot be all small. This is the main\ndifference with respect to the previous case, and implies that sterile oscillation effects are present\neven for \u2206m2i4 = 0. To understand better this point let us consider the case \u2206m214 \u2192 0. In this\n11\n\nNarrow dips in Pee (E\u03bd ) are possible close to specific energies such that the mostly sterile state crosses active\nneutrinos when their position-dependent eigenvalues are maximal. A look at fig. 5a might help to understand\nthis issue.\n\n20\n\n\flimit neutrinos exit from the sun as an incoherent mixture of \u03bd2 and \u03bd1 , which both contain some\nsterile component. At E\u03bd \u226b E\u2217 LMA is fully effective and neutrinos exit as pure \u03bd2 , so that\nvacuum oscillations related to the small \u2206m214 have no effect. On the contrary, at E\u03bd <\n\u223c E\u2217 there\nis a \u03bd1 component which experiences vacuum oscillations with the mostly sterile state. These\nvacuum oscillations affect the \u03bde flux (if \u03bds is mixed with \u03bde as in fig. 6c), or the \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 flux (if \u03bds is\nmixed with \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 as in fig. 6d). In general, a mostly sterile state significantly mixed with \u03bd1 and\nalmost degenerate to it, \u2206m214 \u223c 10\u221210 eV2 , gives significant spectral distortions, but only below\nthe energy threshold of SK and SNO. This is illustrated in fig. 7 by the sample points D, E and\nF.\nFig. 6c studies \u03bds /\u03bde oscillations for generic values of \u2206m214 , and is similar to fig. 6a,b apart\nfrom the difference discussed above. \u03bds /\u03bd\u03bc mixing affects solar neutrinos in the same way as\n\u03bds /\u03bd\u03c4 mixing, and both cases give relatively mild effects, as shown in fig. 6d.\nIt is interesting to notice that there are sizable and specific earth matter effects if the sterile\nneutrino has a large mixing e.g. with \u03bde , and is quasi-degenerate e.g. to \u03bd1 . In fact, the two\nquasi-degenerate neutrinos have different amounts of active and sterile components; due to\nmatter effects, in \u221a\nthe earth the two states are no longer quasi-degenerate, giving oscillations\nwith wave-length 2\u03c0/GF Ne\u2295 \u223c 6000 km, comparable to the size of the earth\nIn all cases fig.s 6 show the regions already excluded at 90 and 99% C.L. (2 dof) by present\ndata (these regions are precisely defined by \u03c72 > \u03c72min + 4.6 and 9.2).12 We emphasize that\nmost of the excluded regions are disfavoured only by combining high-energy (SNO, SK) with\nlow-energy (Gallium) solar data: each kind of data-sets alone tests only a minor region. This\nmeans that present data are already able of fixing oscillation parameters with some redundancy,\npartially testing the LMA hypothesis. Only little regions are excluded if we fit only high-energy\ndata, or only low-energy data. In fact, sterile oscillations that crucially involve \u03bd1 affect solar\nneutrinos only at E\u03bd <\n\u223c E\u2217 because only in this energy range the sun emits \u03bd1 .\nThe other contours in fig.s 6 show which regions can be explored by some future experiments.\n\n\u2022 In view of the previous comment it should be not surprising that the relatively more\npowerful future measurement (dotted green line) is an improved measurement of Pee at\nsub-MeV energies. Taking into account solar model uncertainties and plans of future\nexperiments, we assumed - maybe optimistically - that it will be possible to see 0.02\nshifts from the LMA value of Pee .13\n\u2022 The red continuous line shows what can be achieved by measuring the day/night asymmetry (normalized as 2(Rday \u2212 Rnight )/(Rday + Rnight )) at Boron energies with 0.01 precision\nin a future Mton water \u010cerenkov experiment. We have considered this test because the\nneeded experiment seems highly motivated by various other considerations.\n12\n\nUsing instead \u03c72 > \u03c72LMA + 4.6 and 9.2 would give slightly weaker constraints. One might think that this\nlatter procedure should be preferred because gives more 'robust' bounds. It gives instead under-constraining\nbounds. More robust bounds should be obtained demanding a higher C.L. to the correct statistical test, rather\nthan inventing 'more robust' tests. A correct 90% C.L. bound does not hold with more than 90% probability.\n13\nAs in [42] we averaged Pee assuming that pp neutrinos will be detected by elastic scattering on electrons;\nsimilar results hold for other possible techniques. Assuming that LMA is the end of the story, ref. [42] found\nthat feasible sub-MeV measurements would not have a significant impact on the determination of the oscillation parameters. We here find that sub-MeV measurements are instead crucially important for probing sterile\noscillations.\n\n21\n\n\fms \u226b m2\nms >\n\u223c m2\nms <\n\u223c m2\nms \u226b m1\nms >\n\u223c m1\n\n\u03b8ad \u226a \u03b8s \u226a 1\nno effect\nPes = 1 at large E\u03bd , 0 below\nno effect\npeak Pes \u223c 1 at E \u223c E\u2217\nPes \u223c 1 decreases at E\u03bd > E\u2217\n\n\u03b8s \u223c 1\nPes \u223c 1\nPes \u223c 1 increases at E\u03bd > E\u2217\nPes \u223c 1 decreases at E\u03bd > E\u2217\nPes \u223c 1 decreases at E\u03bd > E\u2217\nPes \u223c 1 decreases at E\u03bd > E\u2217\n\nTable 1: Rough classification of possible sterile MSW resonances in the sun. ms , m1 and m2 are\nrespectively the masses of the mostly \u03bds , \u03bd1a and \u03bd2a states; E\u2217 \u223c few MeV is the LMA critical\nenergy and \u03b8ad \u223c (\u2206m2 /10\u22129 eV2 )1/2 . No effect is present if \u03b8s \u226a \u03b8ad .\n\u2022 Coming to near-future experiments, the other lines show what Borexino (and/or possibly\nKamLAND) can do by studying (mainly) Beryllium neutrinos. We do not show the impact\nof a measurement of the total rate, which has a relatively large theoretical error [38]14 and\ninstead focus on signals that LMA predicts to be unobservable. The region inside the\ncontinuous blue line has a day/night asymmetry in the Beryllium rate larger than 0.02.\nIn the region inside the dot-dashed blue line the Beryllium rate shows anomalous seasonal\nvariations with amplitude larger than 0.02. The physics behind these effects is similar\nto the one well known from discussions of LOW and (Q)VO \u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 oscillations (now\nexcluded).\n\u2022 We do not show results for a few other signals, that seem less promising than the ones\ndiscussed above. One can measure better the energy spectrum of Boron neutrinos, measure\nBeryllium neutrinos both in NC and CC scatterings, and look for day/night or seasonal\nvariations in pp neutrino rates. Active/sterile oscillations with \u2206m2 \u223c 10\u22125 and tan2 \u03b8s \u223c\n0.1 can distort the \u03bd\u0304e energy spectrum in KamLAND or in future reactor experiments.\nIn table 1 we qualitatively classify how MSW resonances with a sterile neutrino affect solar\nneutrinos. The main variables are: which state is crossed, how large is the mixing. Fig. 7 shows\na few examples of specific oscillation patterns compatible with present data.\n\n4.4\n\nHints and anomalies: solar data\n\nFinally, we have studied if present solar data contain hints of sterile neutrino effects. There are\ntwo ways of searching for new effects: data-driven or theory-driven.\nIn the data-driven approach one performs a goodness-of-fit test, that should reveal if data\ncontain some generic indication for new physics beyond LMA oscillations. In practice, this means\ncarefully looking if data contain hints of anomalous results.15 Present neutrino data contain the\nfollowing non-statistically-significant hints:\nFor values of the oscillation parameters around the 'vertex' of the MSW 'triangle' (at \u2206m214 \u2248 10\u22125.5 eV2\nand \u03b8s \u2248 10\u22122 ) sterile neutrinos can give a deep dip in Pee at EBe = 0.863 MeV. Such effects can significantly\nreduce the total rate at Borexino compatibly with present data and without giving different kind of signals, such\nas day/night or seasonal variations.\n15\nIn the past, global analyses of solar data reported the result of a Person \u03c72 test. Today it would tell that\neven the LOW solution (which has been excluded) is perfectly acceptable. Therefore the fact that, according to\nthe \u03c72 test, LMA gives a good fit is not a useful\ninformation. In fact, as discussed in [41], the \u03c72 test is only\n\u221a\n2\nsensitive to variations in the \u03c7 larger than N , where N \u223c 100 is the number of data points. In the present\n14\n\n22\n\n\f\u2022 The rate measured by the Chlorine experiment is 1.4 experimental standard deviations\nlower than the best-fit value predicted by active-only oscillations.16\n\u2022 The lack of an up-turn in present \u03bde energy spectra does not give a statistically significative\nhint for new effects additional to LMA oscillations. To get a feeling of how accurately SNO\nand (mainly) SK data test the energy spectrum around E\u03bd \u223c 10 MeV we fit these data\nassuming\nP (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bde ) = sin2 \u03b8sun + \u03b1(MeV/E\u03bd )2 = 1 \u2212 P (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 ).\n\nAt energies probed by SK and SNO LMA oscillations have this form with \u03b1 \u2248 2. Data\ngive \u03b1 = 1 \u00b1 2.5.\n\n\u2022 A 2 \u00f7 3\u03c3 indication for sterile neutrinos might appear if analyses that suggest higher\nvalues of the nuclear factors S17 (0) and S34 (0) (and therefore a Boron flux higher than\nwhat measured by SNO) were confirmed [43].\n\u2022 According to some reanalyses, solar neutrino rates of various experiments show some time\nmodulation at specific frequencies. However subsequent analyses performed by some experimental collaborations do not corroborate these claims [44].\nThe data-driven approach cannot see new physics that manifests giving small corrections to\nmany observables. These diffuse minor effects can be seen if one knows what one is looking\nfor. More precisely, one performs a fit assuming a theory with n extra parameters and looks if\nthe best-fit improves by more than n. Our plots in fig.s 6 explore a few n = 2 representative\nslices of the full 4-dimensional parameter space of relevant active/sterile oscillation parameters:\nvarious regions (not shown) are favoured in a non statistically significant way. The best fit\nvalues, indicated by the green dots in fig.s 6, have a \u03c72 lower than best-fit LMA oscillations at\nmost by 3 units. In order to study the general 4\u03bd case we also computed local minima of the \u03c72\nusing numerical minimization techniques. We have not found statistically significant indications\nfor an extra sterile neutrino.\n\n4.5\n\nWhat is the bound on the sterile fraction in solar oscillations?\n\nAssuming that solar neutrinos oscillate into \u03bde \u2192 sin \u03b1 \u03bds + cos \u03b1 \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 the question is: what is the\nbound on the 'sterile fraction' \u03b7s \u2261 sin2 \u03b1? We here compare with previous results. Oscillation\neffects at Boron energies can be parameterized as\n\u03a6\u03bde = \u03a6B Pee ,\n\n\u03a6\u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 = \u03a6B (1 \u2212 Pee )(1 \u2212 \u03b7s ),\n\n\u03a6\u03bds = \u03a6B (1 \u2212 Pee )\u03b7s .\n\n(12)\n\nSK and SNO have measured \u03a6\u03bde and the total flux of active neutrinos \u03a6\u03bde,\u03bc,\u03c4 : these two measurements alone cannot determine the three unknown quantities Pee , \u03b7s and \u03a6B (unoscillated\ntotal Boron flux). Adding the solar model prediction for \u03a6B gives\n\u03b7s \u2248\n\n\u03a6B \u2212 \u03a6\u03bde,\u03bc,\u03c4\n\u2248 0 \u00b1 0.2\n\u03a6B \u2212 \u03a6\u03bde\n\n(13)\n\ncase N \u226b 1: this explains why the \u03c72 test is so inefficient and one has to perform less standard more efficient\ntests.\n16\nBefore revising solar model predictions including the recent LUNA data [39], the Chlorine rate was lower by\n1.7\u03c3 (according to our results, in agreement with other similar analyses, see e.g. [40]). The inclusion of LUNA\nresults negligibly affects the global fit of solar and KamLAND data in terms of active/active oscillations.\n\n23\n\n\fwhere \u03b7s is small because \u03a6B agrees with the measured total \u03bde,\u03bc,\u03c4 flux. In line of principle this\nagreement might be accidental: \u03a6B could be larger than what predicted by solar models, and a\nfraction of it could oscillate into sterile neutrinos leaving a reduced \u03a6\u03bde,\u03bc,\u03c4 . In view of all other\nconstraints (on spectral distortions, Gallium rates,. . . ) it seems difficult to realize this scenario\nwith oscillations.\nMost previous analyses prefer to obtain constraints on \u03b7s only from this second argument.\nThey add one sterile neutrino mixed only with \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 and separated by a large mass splitting:\n\u2206m214 \u226b \u2206m2sun . This special configuration gives an energy-independent \u03b7s and an energy\ndependence of Pee similar to what obtained for \u03b7s = 0. This choice does not allow to fit low\nenergy Gallium data together with high energy SNO and SK data: the resulting bound on \u03b7s\nis [2]\n\u03b7s \u2248 0 \u00b1 0.1,\n(14)\nsomewhat stronger than the bound in eq. (13) obtained using only the solar model prediction for\nthe Boron flux. We stress that this constraint on \u03b7s can be relaxed by making milder assumptions\non the active/sterile oscillation parameters. For example, even still maintaining \u2206m2 \u226b \u2206m2sun\n\u03b7s is energy-dependent if the heavy \u03bds mixes with \u03bde , or with the mass eigenstate \u03bd1 (\u03b7s is about\n2 times larger at lower energy, see fig. 7) or with \u03bd2 (\u03b7s is about 2 times larger at higher energy).\nWhen we focus on the special configuration considered by previous analyses we get \u03c72 (\u03b7s =\n1/4) \u2212 \u03c72 (\u03b7s = 0) = 8.3 (including in the fit the BP00 prediction for the total Boron flux) and\n6.9 (not including the prediction for the Boron flux: this value of the \u2206\u03c72 agrees with other\nanalyses [2]). In fact, in the special configuration our parameter \u03b8s is related to the sterile\nfraction as sin2 \u03b8s = 2\u03b7s (for maximal atmospheric mixing). We produced fig. 6 including in our\ndata-set the solar model prediction for the total Boron flux. Dropping it would give only minor\nmodifications, as a comparison of eq. (13) with eq. (14) indicates.\n\n5\n\nSterile effects in supernovae and other astrophysical\nsources of neutrinos\n\nHaving discussed sterile effects in the sun, it is useful to discuss the analogous effects in corecollapse supernovae (SN) focussing on the differences between the two cases and emphasizing\nwhat one loses and what one gains studying SN neutrinos.\n\u2022 Present detectors can only study SN neutrinos from our galaxy, and possibly from nearby\ngalaxies: such SN neutrinos have a duty time of O(10) seconds every O(109 ) seconds [45,\n46]. This makes backgrounds less problematic, but allowed to detect so far only O(10)\nSN1987A events [56]. Running solar neutrino experiments could detect thousands of events\nfrom a future SN exploding at distance D \u223c 10 kpc. An even more impressive harvest\nof data could come from a future Mton water-\u010cerenkov detector or from other more SNoriented future projects [47].\n\u2022 In a SN the matter density grows from zero up to nuclear density (\u03c1 \u2243 1014 g cm\u22123 ) in\nthe stiff inner core: matter effects are important for all the mass range that we consider\n(up to about 102 eV). In this mass range, and given the typical SN neutrino energy\nof \u223c 10 MeV, active/sterile MSW resonances occur outside the neutrino-sphere (roughly\n24\n\n\fdefined as the regions after which neutrinos freely stream, \u03c1 \u226a 1012 g cm\u22123 ). In particular,\nconversions inside the neutrino-spheres (which could drain almost all the SN energy) do\nnot take place.17 We only receive neutrinos that come out of the neutrino-spheres on the\nside of the SN closer to us. Unlike the case of the sun, it is not necessary to average\nover the production point, because the production and the oscillation regions are spatially\nseparated.\n\u2022 While only \u03bde are produced in the sun, SN produce all active \u03bd and \u03bd\u0304, roughly in similar\namounts [46]. They mix and convert among themselves, and possibly with sterile neutrinos [53, 51, 54, 52]. Present experiments can accurately study \u03bd\u0304e . In fact in the energy\nrange me \u226a E\u03bd \u226a mp relevant for SN neutrinos, \u03bd\u0304e p \u2192 \u0113n scatterings allows to detect \u03bd\u0304e\nand to measure their energy. Detecting other neutrinos (e.g. via \u03bde scattering, deuterium\ndissociation, \u03bde absorption on carbon) is possible and future projects could give significant\ninformation. In the following, we focus on the \u03bd\u0304e flux.\n\u2022 \u03bd\u0304e,\u03bc,\u03c4 experience no active/active matter resonance (unlike \u03bde,\u03bc,\u03c4 ; we are assuming normal\nhierarchy, and equal initial fluxes of muon and tau-neutrinos): their effective \u2206m2 in\nmatter increases in a monotonous way when the matter density grows. The sterile effect\nthat can more strongly affect the \u03bd\u0304e rate is a low-density \u03bds /\u03bd1 MSW resonance, possible\nwhen the mostly sterile neutrino is lighter than \u03bd1 (i.e. \u03b8s > \u03c0/4 in our parameterization).\nFurthermore, due to the peculiar composition of the inner part of the mantle (deleptonized\nmatter) the \u03bde potential changes its sign in the deep region of the mantle, and it does so\nin a very steep manner [46, 48, 49, 50] (see fig. 5b), adding a MSW resonance also for\n\u03b8s < \u03c0/4. Although details are uncertain, this is a robust prediction. It implies that \u03bds\nalways meets a \"sharp\" resonance with \u03bd\u0304e in the deep region of the mantle [51, 52].\n\u2022 SN neutrinos are emitted from galactic distances, allowing to probe vacuum oscillations\nwith \u2206m2 as low as 10\u221218 eV2 (the precise value depend on the SN and on its distance\nfrom the earth: different SN probe different ranges).\nSN neutrino reach energies higher than solar \u03bd, perhaps up to 100 MeV, and could therefore\nprobe earth matter effects and spectral distortions.\n\u2022 While the sun is essentially static, an exploding SN is a dynamical environment (neutrino\nlight-curve evolution, passage of the shock wave...); including the time dependence in the\nneutrino fluxes and in the matter density profile is too much demanding and probably\nuseless for our purposes, given the poor knowledge of the details. We focus on a typical\nSN configuration, which includes all the characteristic features of the SN cooling phase.\nA reliable prediction of the emitted fluxes is still lacking and the explosion mechanism is not\nyet under control. However, it is relatively easier to predict the \u03bde,\u03bc,\u03c4 , \u03bd\u0304e,\u03bc,\u03c4 energy spectra,\nwhich in thermal approximation only depend on their cross sections. On the contrary their\ntotal fluxes also depend on the SN density profile; in particular the thermal approximation\ndoes not imply equipartition among different flavours. The underlying complexity of SN\n2\n17\n5\nThe resonances with the sterile state would enter in the neutrino-spheres (in the inner core) for \u2206m2 >\n\u223c 10 eV\n2\n7\n>\n( \u223c 10 eV respectively).\n\n25\n\n\fexplosions makes hard to reduce theoretical uncertainties, posing a threat on the usefulness\nof precise SN \u03bd experiments as tools for studying oscillations.\nAs a last warning, we have to recall the reluctance of the neutrino data from the only SN\nwe know to fit into a simple and straightforward interpretation. The main reasons are:\nthe energy distribution of Kamiokande and IMB look different; both experiments have an\nexcess of forward events; the 5 LSD events cannot be accounted for.\nAs for the future, there are various interesting observables, and it is difficult to guess on which\nsignals we should focus. This will probably depend on compromises among future experimental\nand theoretical capabilities.\nSeveral SN-related bounds on the active/sterile neutrino mixing have been considered in the\nliterature [51, 53, 54, 55]. Focussing on the cooling phase neutrinos, they include (i) the detection\nof \u03bd\u0304e from SN1987a in the Kamiokande and IMB experiments [56], which sets a constraint on\nthe portion of neutrinos that oscillate into \u03bds ; (ii) r-process nucleosynthesis: a fraction of the\nheavy elements in nature is supposed to be synthesized in the region surrounding the core of\nthe exploding stars, provided that the electron fraction Ye < 0.5; even small modifications of\nneutrino fluxes affect the process, so that the request of a successful nucleosynthesis has been\nused to set limits (see e.g. [55, 51]); (iii) re-heating of the shock: in the delayed-shock/neutrinodriven picture of SN explosion, the flux of neutrinos and antineutrinos from the early stages of\nthe accretion phase (which should carry 10 \u00f720 % of the total flux) are responsible for the actual\nexplosion of the star, pushing from below the stalling shock wave; since \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e are the most\neffective in this (interacting with charged and neutral currents with baryonic matter), a cut of\ntheir flux would prevent this mechanism from working [51, 54, 57]; (iv)... We will only consider\nthe bound from direct observation, which we consider robust enough.18\n\n5.1\n\nTechnical details\n\nThe analysis of SN neutrinos can be carried on in a way similar to that of solar neutrinos, after\nadapting the computational procedure to SN peculiarities, which introduce some complications\nand allow some simplifications. We must follow the fate of the neutrinos emitted from neutrinospheres along their travel through the star matter, the vacuum and the earth. The density matrix\nformalism, already described in the 'solar' section 4.1, automatically handles the complication\nthat the SN initial neutrino flux has a mixed flavour composition. In the SN case one should\nfollow the evolution of two 4 \u00d7 4 density matrices: \u03c1(E\u03bd ) for neutrinos, and \u03c1\u0304(E\u03bd ) for antineutrinos. We focus on the total \u03bd\u0304e rate, as measured by \u03bd\u0304e p scatterings with the cuts and\nefficiency of the KamiokandeII experiment. The cross section is taken from [58].\nMSW resonances affect the neutrino density matrix, possibly introducing off-diagonal elements which are however averaged to zero by large oscillation phases. Therefore we can combine\nprobabilities rather than quantum amplitudes: the 4 \u00d7 4 density matrix can be replaced by\n18\n\nIndeed, for instance, alternative sites for effective nucleosynthesis have been repeatedly proposed. Moreover,\nthe position of such a bound could depend quite heavily on the complicated details of SN dynamics and, in\naddition, on the interplay of sterile oscillations with it, see below. On the same footing, since the details and the\nnature itself of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism are still to be fully understood, we do not consider it\nhere as a robust constraint, not mentioning that it would require a demanding understanding and simulation of\nthe evolution of the SN mantle.\n\n26\n\n\fa 4-vector containing its diagonal elements, \u03a6 = (\u03c111 , \u03c122 , \u03c133 , \u03c144 ) and the evolution equation\n\u03c1 = U * \u03c10 * U \u2020 (U = Un * * * U1 ) by [53]\n\u03a6 = Pn * * * P1 * \u03a60\n\n(Pn )ij = |(Un )ij |2\n\nwhere\n\n(15)\n\nare 4 \u00d7 4 matrices of conversion probabilities. At the production region, matter effects are dominant, so that matter eigenstates coincide with flavour eigenstates (up to a trivial permutation):\n\u03a60 = (\u03a60\u03bd\u0304s , \u03a6\u03bd\u03040e , \u03a60\u03bd\u0304\u03c4 , \u03a60\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ). \u03a6 are the fluxes of neutrino vacuum eigenstates reaching the earth\nsurface, related to the fluxes of flavour eigenstates by an incoherent sum weighted by the the\nneutrino mixing matrix V :\n\u0010\n\n\u03a6\u03bd\u0304e , \u03a6\u03bd\u0304\u03bc , \u03a6\u03bd\u0304\u03c4 , \u03a6\u03bd\u0304s\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03b1\n\n=\n\nX\ni\n\n|V\u03b1i |2 \u03a6i\n\n(16)\n\nIf neutrinos cross the earth, earth matter effects [59] may reintroduce coherencies among the\nvarious fluxes, and one must return to the general quantum expression. Similarly, if two states\n2\n\u221218\nhave \u2206m2 <\n\u223c 10 eV vacuum oscillations do not give large phases: evolution in the outer region\nof the SN and in vacuum must be described keeping the off-diagonal components of the matrix\ndensity. In practice, we found convenient to evolve the density matrix in the instantaneous mass\neigenstate basis, setting to zero its off diagonal elements when they accumulate large phases.\nThis procedure is described in greater detail in the 'atmospheric' section 6.1.\nThe effect of active/active oscillations is well known [59]: the LMA resonance is adiabatic\nand partially swaps active neutrinos, giving19\n\u03a6after\n= cos2 \u03b8sun \u03a6before\n+ sin2 \u03b8sun \u03a6before\n\u03bd\u0304e\n\u03bd\u0304e\n\u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4\n\n\u03a6after\n= sin2 \u03b8sun \u03a6before\n+ cos2 \u03b8sun \u03a6before\n\u03bde\n\u03bde\n\u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4\n\n(17)\n\nActive/sterile MSW resonances can occur after of before the LMA resonance.\nConcerning the initial fluxes, the accurate results of simulations are usually empirically approximated by a so called \"pinched\" Fermi-Dirac spectrum for each flavor \u03b1 = \u03bde , \u03bd\u0304e , \u03bdx (\u03bdx\ncollectively denotes \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 , \u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4 ) [60, 46]\nd\u03a6\u03bd\u03b1\n120 L\u03b1\nE2\n(E\u03bd , t) = N(\u03b7\u03b1 ) 4 4 E\u03bd /T \u2212\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\n+1\ndt dE\u03bd\n7\u03c0 T\u03b1 e\n\n(18)\n\nwhere the pinching parameter \u03b7\u03b1 takes the typical values \u03b7\u03bde \u223c 5 \u2212 3, \u03b7\u03bd\u0304e \u223c 2.5 \u2212 2, \u03b7\u03bdx \u223c 0 \u2212 2.\nFor \u03b7\u03b1 = 0 the normalization factor is N = 1 and T = hE\u03bd i/3.15.

This configuration lasts for a short\ntransient period, until the neutrino diffusion depletes their abundance and carries the potential to negative values,\nwhere it stays. A small fraction of the electron (anti)neutrinos produced in the deep core could then oscillate\ninto sterile states and constitute a non vanishing flux injected in the mantle.\n21\nFor the very high densities closer to the core, mN should be replaced by a (quite different) effective nucleon\nmass.

We adopt the profiles represented in fig. 8 [50] and we model them with\nanalytic functions that preserve their main features.22 Namely, the density profile decreases\naccording to a power law r \u22124 out of the \u223c 10 km inner core (where instead it has a roughly\nconstant, nuclear density value). At much larger distances the density profile gets modified in\na time-dependent way by the passage of the shock wave. Present simulations have difficulties\nin reproducing this phenomenon and therefore cannot reliably predict the density profile in the\n3\n4\n3\nouter region. Therefore for r >\n\u223c 500 km we assume a power law \u03c1 = 1.5 10 (R\u2299 /r) g/cm , which\nroughly describes the static progenitor star.\nThe peculiar Ye profile in fig. 8 is inevitably dictated by the deleptonization process [49, 48]:\nbehind the shock wave which has passed in the mantle matter, the electron capture on the\nnewly liberated protons is rapid, driving Ye to low values (\u223c 1/4). In the outer region, where\nthe density is sensibly lower, the efficiency of the capture is much lower, so that Ye essentially\nmaintains the value \u223c 1/2 typical of normal matter. This is important because the matter\npotential Ve of electron (anti)neutrinos flips sign, see eq. (20), when, in the deep region of the\nmantle Ye steeply decreases below 1/3. On the contrary, at this point the matter potentials of\nmuon and tau (anti)neutrinos are marginally affected. Both are plotted in fig. 8.\nThe data refer to \u223c0.3 sec after bounce for a typical star of \u223c 11 solar masses. The subsequent\nevolution is supposed to move the wave of the Ye profile slightly outwards, maintaining, however,\nits characteristic shape. The slight dependence on the progenitor mass, in turn, is not really\nrelevant [63].\nThis SN density profile has been computed [50] in absence of sterile neutrinos effects. Adding\na sterile neutrino, \u03bde \u2192 \u03bds conversions can reduce Ye due to a non-trivial feedback mechanism on\nthe MSW potential experienced by neutrinos [51, 55]. This could even create a new intermediate\nregion with Ye < 1/3, thus introducing two more level-crossing in the \u03bd\u0304e channel. We neglect\nthese possible extra MSW resonances because they do not affect the \u03bd\u0304e rate when they are both\nadiabatic, or both fully non adiabatic.\nIn summary, although the profiles that we adopt come from a specific computation and\nrefer to a specific instant in time, they incorporate the peculiar features that are important for\nour purposes. A more refined treatment of this point (later times behavior of the profiles, fine\nstructures connected with the passage of the shock wave...) would of course require to obtain\nfirst a complete simulation of the SN evolution, including the explosion. This could be needed to\ndescribe the signal from a future supernova, but seems unnecessarily complicated for SN1987A.\n\n5.2\n\nResults\n\nActive/sterile mixing significantly affects SN neutrinos for \u03b8s \u223c 1. Due to MSW resonances,\nsignificant effects can also be present for small mixing, i.e. \u03b8s \u2192 0 and \u03b8s \u2192 \u03c0/2. The re22\n\nWe thank Adam Burrows for having provided us with the data, and for useful discussions.\n\n29\n\n\fcently established active/active mixings are not taken into account in older studies [53, 54] (see\nhowever [52]). To understand the main features it is useful to look at the pattern of possible\nlevel crossings, qualitatively depicted in fig. 5b at page 18. The three mostly active anti-neutrino\neigenstates depend on the radius r as dictated by their measured masses and mixings (we assume\n\u03b813 = 0 and normal hierarchy) and by the predicted SN density profiles, and are represented in\nfig. 5b by the three colored curves. The mostly sterile neutrino is generically represented by an\nalmost-horizontal line, which is plotted in fig. 5b in the specific case of small \u03bd\u0304e /\u03bd\u0304s mixing and\n\u2206m214 \u226b \u2206m2atm . There are three possible kinds of active/sterile MSW resonances [51, 52, 53, 54]:\n1. The mostly \u03bd\u0304s eigenstate crosses the mostly \u03bd\u0304e eigenstate at r \u223c 100 km, where Ve flips\nsign. At this point matter effects dominate over active neutrino masses, so that active\nmass eigenstates coincide with flavour eigenstates. Since Ve flips sign in a steep way this\n\u22121\u00f70\nresonance is effective only if \u2206m214 >\neV2 (different SN simulations gives values in\n\u223c 10\nthis range).\n2. If the mostly sterile eigenstate is the lightest one (in our parameterization this needs\n\u03b8s >\n\u223c \u03c0/4) the two eigenstates in 1. cross again at larger r. Pictorially, this second resonance is present when the sterile black line is lower than what assumed in fig. 5b. This\nMSW resonance occurs at large r where Ve is smooth, so that it is effective down to\n\u22126\u00f78\n\u2206m214 >\neV2 . Again, the significant uncertainty is due to uncertainties on the SN\n\u223c 10\ndensity gradient.\n3. If instead the mostly sterile eigenstate is the heaviest or the next-to-heaviest state, it crosses\none or both of two mostly \u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4 eigenstates. This is the case illustrated in fig. 5b. The values\nof \u2206m224 and \u2206m234 determine at which r these crossings takes place, and consequently the\nflavour composition of the mostly active states at the resonance. Entering in the SN, the\nm\nsmall \u03bd\u0304e component of \u03bd\u03042,3\ndisappears as soon as Ve \u2212 V\u03bc dominates over \u2206m2sun .23 The\ncolor of mass eigenstates in fig. 5b illustrates these phenomena. In any case, active/sterile\nMSW resonances with the mostly \u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4 states do not significantly affect the \u03bd\u0304e rate, see\neq. (17).\nThese considerations allow to understand fig.s 9, where we plot our results for the reduction of\nthe \u03bd\u0304e rate due to sterile mixing.\nLet us start from fig. 9a that studies \u03bd1 /\u03bds mixing. Resonance 1 gives a sizable reduction\nin region 1 of fig. 9a and resonance 2 gives a sizable reduction in region 2. Had we ignored\nsolar mixing the maximal deficit would have been 100%, while in presence of solar oscillations\nthe maximal effect is a \u223c 80% deficit (see also [52]). More precisely, in the interior of region 1\none obtains \u03a6\u03bd\u0304e = sin2 \u03b8sun \u03a60\u03bd\u0304e because resonances 1 and 3 are fully adiabatic. In the interior of\nregion 2 one obtains \u03a6\u03bd\u0304e = sin2 \u03b8sun \u03a60\u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4 because resonance 2 is fully adiabatic and resonance\n1 irrelevant. Therefore, given the assumed initial fluxes, the \u03bd\u0304e rate gets reduced slightly more\nstrongly in region 2 than in region 1.\nIn region 12 both resonances 1 and 2 are effective, and tend to compensate among each other:\nresonance 1 converts \u03bd\u0304e into \u03bd\u0304s and resonance 2 reconverts \u03bd\u0304s into \u03bd\u0304e . In region 3, resonances 3\ngives a 20% suppression of the \u03bd\u0304e rate, that sharply terminates when \u2206m214 < \u2206m2sun . This is\n23\n\nWhen V\u03bc \u2212 V\u03c4 dominates over \u2206m2atm the flavour composition varies from \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u00b1 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 to \u03bd\u0304\u03bc and \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 .

Distortion of the \u03bd\u0304e flux at sample points A, B, C.\ndue to a strong suppression of the mostly \u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4 eigenstates, which due to solar oscillations would\ngive a 20% contribution to the \u03bd\u0304e rate (ignoring solar mixing, there would be no suppression\nof the \u03bd\u0304e rate in region 3). This reduction of the \u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4 fluxes induced by resonances 3 could\nbe better probed by measuring the NC rate (which gets a <\n\u223c 40% reduction) and, if neutrinos\ncross the earth, by distortions of the \u03bd\u0304e energy spectrum. At smaller \u2206m2 and around maximal\nmixing vacuum oscillations can reduce the \u03bd\u0304e rate by <\n\u223c 50%: their effect persists down to\n\u2206m2 \u223c E\u03bd /D \u223c 10\u221218 eV2 . The precise value depends on the distance D (we assumed D = 10\nkpc).\nThe other mixing cases are understood in similar ways. We remind that our parametrization\nis discontinuous at \u03b8s = \u03c0/4: this is reflected in fig. 9b, where we consider \u03bd2 /\u03bds mixing. Resonance 2 sharply terminates when \u2206m224 < \u2206m2sun . Up to these differences, this case is quite\nsimilar to the previous one, because \u03bd\u03041 and \u03bd\u03042 get strongly mixed by matter effects.\nOn the contrary \u03bd3 /\u03bds mixing (not shown) does not give a significant reduction of the \u03bd\u0304e rate.\nMixing with the flavour eigenstates behaves in a similar way. Namely, the \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 /\u03bds figure shows\nthe reduction in region 3 due to resonances 3, and the \u03bde /\u03bds figure shows the reduction in region\n1 due to resonance 1. The additional feature at \u2206m214 \u223c \u2206m2sun is due to adiabatic conversion\n(for large sterile angles) between the mostly-sterile state and \u03bd2 , that are almost degenerate in\nthis condition. For larger \u2206m214 , there is no \u03bd\u0304e component in \u03bd\u03042m so that the crossing is totally\nnon adiabatic, while for smaller \u2206m214 the two states are separated. As in the solar case, sterile\neffects persists at all values of \u2206m214 , even if it is small. Unlike in the solar case, such effects are\nnot sensitive to vacuum oscillations (i.e. \u2206m2 \u223c E\u03bd /D \u223c 10\u221218 eV2 ) because in a SN neutrinos\nof all energies experience the adiabatic LMA resonance. Therefore in the lower row of fig.s 9 we\nonly show results at \u2206m214 > 10\u22126 eV2 ; nothing changes at smaller values.\nSN1987A data can be precisely compared with expectations doing an event by event fit [64];\nhowever the result strongly depends on the assumed average energies and total luminosities of\nthe initial fluxes. The data do not permit detailed studies of the energy distribution. Even\nmore, they cannot discriminate in a significant way between a larger total flux with smaller\naverage energy and a smaller flux with higher average energy. In absence of a quantitative\nestimation of theoretical uncertainties, and in view of the doubtful aspects of SN1987A data\n32\n\n\fdiscussed previously, today we cannot derive precise constraints. Therefore we simply shaded as\n'disfavoured' regions where sterile effects reduce the \u03bd\u0304e rate by more than 70%. This is nothing\nmore than a reasonable arbitrary choice.\nFuture data will permit to know precisely the total rate of \u03bd\u0304e events, and also its distribution\nin energy and time. The most important single observable could be the average E\u03bd\u0304e energy,\nor more generically the energy spectrum. Rather than showing iso-contour plots of hE\u03bd\u0304e i we\ndescribe their main features. In absence of sterile oscillations we expect hE\u03bd\u0304e i \u2248 15 MeV. Along\nthe 'diagonal sides of the MSW triangles' 1 and 2 (e.g. around our sample point B) the average\nenergy increases up to hE\u03bd\u0304e i \u2248 18 MeV. Along the 'diagonal sides of the MSW triangle' 12 it can\ndecrease down to hE\u03bd\u0304e i \u2248 11 MeV. Vacuum oscillations can give the well known distortions of the\nspectrum, as exemplified in fig. 10C. These effects seem larger than experimental and theoretical\nuncertainties. In all other cases sterile effects give a quasi-energy-independent suppression of the\n\u03bd\u0304e rate, and therefore negligibly affect hE\u03bd\u0304e i. Fig. 10A gives an example. Of course, the average\nenergy of positrons generated by \u03bd\u0304e p \u2192 n\u0113 scatterings is higher than hE\u03bd\u0304e i because the cross\nsection increases with energy.\nWe focused on supernova antineutrinos. The analogous plots for neutrinos cannot obtained\nfrom our \u03bd\u0304 plots by flipping tan \u03b8s \u2192 1/ tan \u03b8s , because we are taking into account the effects of\nactive/active oscillations. Effects in neutrinos are more similar to what happens to solar \u03bde .\n\n5.3\n\nHints and anomalies: supernovae\n\nTo conclude, we list hints of anomalous effects possibly related to sterile effects in SN neutrinos:\n\u2022 In the past, the initial SN neutrino fluxes in different flavours were believed to follow an\nalmost exact equipartition of the energy and have gaps in neutrino temperatures larger than\nin eq. (19) (typical values were 13, 16, 23 MeV [46]). Under these assumptions SN1987A\ndata, which point to a lower average energy, disfavor solar oscillations with large mixing\nangle (sin2 2\u03b8sun < 0.9 at 99% C.L. [65]) while solar data established the relatively large\nmixing sin2 2\u03b8sun \u2248 0.8. The tension strongly depends on the initial temperatures, and\ndisappears assuming the more recent values in eq. (19) [65].\n\u2022 Pulsar motion. It has been proposed that the resonant (or non resonant [66]) conversion of\nsterile neutrinos could explain the observed large proper velocity of newly born neutrons\nstars [67]. Indeed, in presence of very strong and axially oriented magnetic fields, which\ncould be plausible in the NS environment, the MSW potential includes a contribution (at\none loop, from neutrino scattering on the polarized medium) which depends on the relative\nangle between the neutrino momentum and the magnetic field; this leads to an asymmetric\nneutrino emission, which could be enough to account for the observed velocities. This\n\u22127\nmechanism needs sterile neutrinos with keV-scale masses and \u03b8s <\n\u223c 10 .\n\u2022 r-process nucleosynthesis [55]: \u03bde \u2192 \u03bds conversions in the mantle of the star could drive\nYe to low values and have thus been proposed to provide a favorable environment for\nr-process nucleosynthesis. The relevant range of \u03bde /\u03bds mixing parameters spans \u2206m2 \u223c\n(1 \u00f7 102 ) eV2 and sin2 2\u03b8s \u223c 10\u22123 \u00f7 few10\u22121 , which should be checked against the bounds\n33\n\n\ffrom cosmological probes that we discussed in the present paper. In the same region, the\n\"conversion plus re-conversion\" of antineutrinos instead guarantees that the SN \u03bd\u0304e is not\ndramatically affected.\n\n5.4\n\nNeutrinos from other astrophysical sources\n\nDifferent kinds of experiments will try to detect neutrinos emitted by extragalactic sources, such\nas active galactic nuclei. There are no firm expectations. In particular we do not know if the\nfluxes of these neutrinos will be detectably large, and eventually in which energy range. However,\nsince these neutrinos are presumably mostly generated by \u03c0 decays, like atmospheric neutrinos,\none expects similar fluxes of \u03bd and \u03bd\u0304 with flavour ratio e : \u03bc : \u03c4 \u223c 1 : 2 : 0 (this expectation\nmight be wrong). Atmospheric oscillations then convert the flavour ratio into 1 : 1 : 1, which is\nblind to other active/active oscillations.\nIn presence of an extra sterile neutrino, the e : \u03bc : \u03c4 : s \u223c 1 : 1 : 1 : 0 flavour ratio is\nnot blind to extra active/sterile oscillations. Sterile oscillations can reduce the fluxes of active\nneutrinos, and vary the relative flavour proportion. Since the total initial fluxes and energy\nspectra are unknown, and since experiments will probably be able of tagging \u03bc and maybe \u03c4\nneutrinos well [68], we focus only on the observable \u03a6\u03bc /\u03a6\u03c4 .\nWe assume that the baseline, about 100 Mpc, is much longer than all oscillation lengths. In\nsuch a limit the oscillation probability reduces to multiplication of probabilities (rather than of\nquantum amplitudes):\nP (\u03bdl \u2192 \u03bdl\u2032 ) = P (\u03bd\u0304l \u2192 \u03bd\u0304l\u2032 ) =\n\n4\nX\ni=1\n\n|Vli |2 |Vl\u2032i |2\n\n(22)\n\nOne can verify that sterile mixing with a flavour eigenstate \u03bdl (l = e or \u03bc or \u03c4 ) mainly gives a\ndepletion of \u03a6l . However, as discussed in the rest of this paper, in such a case large active/sterile\nmixing angles are already disfavoured by other data, so that it is not possible to get a sizable\neffect.\nPresent data allow large active/sterile mixing with mass eigenstates \u03bdi (i = 1 or 2 or 3) if \u03bds\nand \u03bdi are quasi-degenerate, with \u2206m2 \u226a 10\u22129 eV2 . In view of the long base-line, neutrinos from\n2\n\u221217\ncosmic sources are affected by oscillations with \u2206m2 >\n\u223c 10 eV . However each of the mostly\nactive mass eigenstates contains roughly equal component of \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 (unless the atmospheric\nmixing angle is non-maximal, or unless \u03b813 and the CP-phase significantly differ from zero):\ntherefore \u03bds /\u03bdi oscillations do not significantly affect \u03a6\u03bc /\u03a6\u03c4 .\nIn conclusion, near-future experiments that will try to discover neutrinos from cosmic sources\ndo not seem to allow promising searches of sterile neutrino oscillations. See also [69].\nEq. (22) also allows to study vacuum oscillation effects in other kinds of cosmological neutrinos:\n\u2022 In a near future it seems possible to detect the \u03bd\u0304e emitted by past core-collapse supernovae. At the moment we only have order-of-magnitude predictions, but future SN\nexperiments and studies might allow to better predict their total flux or spectrum. SK\nalmost reached the apparently necessary sensitivity, and it seems possible to improve the\n\n34\n\n\fefficiency of tagging neutrons emitted in \u03bd\u0304e p \u2192 \u0113n scatterings [70]. Relic SN \u03bd\u0304e are affected by oscillations in the SN (as discussed in the previous section) and by oscillations\n2\n\u221225\nin vacuum (down to \u2206m2 >\n\u223c 10 eV ).\n\u2022 In a far future, it might be possible to directly detect CMB neutrinos by coherent\nscatterings. This would allow to probe oscillations down to \u2206m2 \u223c 10\u221230 eV2 .\n\n6\n\nSterile effects in atmospheric, reactor and beam neutrinos\n\nIn this section we discuss how SK, K2K, MACRO, Chooz, Bugey, CDHS, CCFR, Karmen,\nNomad, Chorus and future experiments of these kinds probe sterile oscillations. KamLAND\ndata have been studied in section 4, together with solar data.\n\n6.1\n\nTechnical details\n\nIt is convenient to compute oscillation probabilities using the neutrino and anti-neutrino density\nmatrices. We convert the initial value (e.g. \u03c1(E\u03bd ) = diag (\u03a6e (E\u03bd ), \u03a6\u03bc (E\u03bd ), 0, 0) for atmospheric\nneutrinos) to the instantaneous mass eigenstate basis, \u03c1m = V \u2020 \u03c1V . In this basis evolution in each\nmedium (air, mantle, core) is simply given by a diagonal matrix of phases, U = diag exp(\u22122i\u03b4)\nwhere \u03b4i = m2\u03bdmi L/4E\u03bd . Using the matrix density in the mass eigenstate basis, we can analytically\naverage 'fast' oscillations to their mean value by appropriately inserting a small imaginary part\n\u01eb in the oscillation phases \u03b4. This is achieved by evolving the matrix density as \u03c1m\nij (L) =\n2i\u03b4ij \u2212\u01eb|\u03b4ij |\nm\nwhere \u03b4ij = \u03b4i \u2212 \u03b4j and \u01eb is an arbitrary positive small number (we choose\n\u03c1ij (0)e\n\u01eb = 0.01|\u03b4ij |). This makes computations much faster than usual techniques which require lengthy\nnumerical averages of the oscillation factors. In the simplest case of vacuum oscillations of 2\nneutrinos this amounts to modify the oscillation factor as sin2 \u03b412 \u2192 (1 \u2212 e\u2212|\u03b412 \u01eb| cos 2\u03b412 )/2.\nAt the air/mantle and mantle/core boundaries eigenstates change in a non-adiabatic way:\nthis effect is accounted by the 'level-crossing' flavour matrices P already described at page 15.\nOur fit of atmospheric data takes into account all most recent results: SK atmospheric\ndata [71], the K2K spectrum and total rate [72], and MACRO [73] data about trough-going\nmuons. These events arise from neutrino scatterings in the rock below the detector: MACRO\nis competitive with SK because the important parameter is the surface of the detector, rather\nthan its mass. We do not include data from older atmospheric experiments, which studied\nessentially the same kind of observables better measured by SK. Data are fitted by forming a\nglobal \u03c72 . Uncertainties are taken into account following [71], and systematically working in\nGaussian approximation. More na\u0131\u0308ve definitions of the \u03c72 (e.g. fitting only the zenith-angle\nspectra of the single classes of events) do not give significantly different final results.\nAtmospheric data contain the evidence for the atmospheric anomaly. We assume it is due\nto \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 oscillations and take into account the uncertainty on \u2206m2atm and on \u03b8atm using the\nsame technique developed in section 4.2 for marginalizing over \u2206m2sun and on \u03b8sun . Even in the\natmospheric case, this technique now gives an accurate analytical approximation to the usual\nactive-only atmospheric fit (not shown). As previously discussed, we assume \u03b813 = 0.\n35\n\n\fFinally, we include \u03bd\u0304e disappearance data from the Chooz [74] (14 bins) and Bugey [75]\n(60 bins) reactor experiments. We include \u03bd\u03bc disappearance data from CDHS [76] (15 bins)\nand CCFR [77] (15 bins). NuTeV data could give additional information, if certain anomalous\nfeatures will be understood [78]. Although disappearance experiments give the dominant constraint on sterile effects, we also include \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e data from Karmen [79], using the likelihood\ncomputed by the Karmen collaboration on an event-by-event basis.24 LSND results are not\nincluded and separately discussed in section 6.4. Finally, we include Nomad and Chorus data\non \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 [80], which are relevant in the case of \u03bd3 /\u03bds mixing at \u2206m2 \u223c 10 eV2 .\n\n6.2\n\nResults\n\nSince there are many relevant experiments, it is useful to divide them into two classes, and\nseparately study their impact:\n1) Fig.s 11 show the constraints from experiments that are not sensitive to the atmospheric\nanomaly (Chooz, Bugey, CDHS, CCFR, Karmen, Nomad, Chorus). Sterile oscillation effects in such experiments are simply described by eq. (2), so that we only had to\ncompile their results. Disappearance experiments provide the dominant constraints.\n2) Atmospheric neutrinos are a powerful probe of neutrino oscillations with large mixing\n2\n\u22124\nangle and \u2206m2 >\n\u223c 10 eV . Fig.s 12 show how the experiments that see the atmospheric\nanomaly (SK, MACRO and K2K) constrain extra oscillations into sterile neutrinos.\nAnalyzing the second class of experiments requires a non trivial work: these experiments probe\nsterile mixing in a significant but indirect way.\nThe upper limit on the 'sterile fraction involved in atmospheric oscillations' conventionally\nquoted in the literature corresponds to the following 'minimal' configuration: \u03bds /\u03bd\u03c4 mixing with\n\u2206m234 \u226b \u2206m2atm . In this limit, the 'sterile fraction' is related to our \u03b8s angle by \u03b7s = sin2 \u03b8s\nand our analysis reasonably agrees with previous computations. Atmospheric neutrinos oscillate\nat a single detectable frequency. Matter effects become relevant at higher neutrino energies\nand suppress active/sterile mixing without affecting \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 oscillations. This effect allows\nto indirectly discriminate the two channels. Sterile oscillations are mostly disfavoured by the\nzenith-angle spectra of \u03bc-like events with TeV-scale energies.\nMore general active/sterile oscillation schemes manifest in different ways. A sterile neutrino\nmixed with different flavours can give appearance signals. Active/sterile oscillations with \u2206m2\ncomparable to \u2206m2atm give oscillations at multiple frequencies, distorted by matter effects. When\n\u2206m234 < 0 matter effects increase the oscillation length and give a non-standard energy and pathlength dependence of P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc ). SK can best probe such effects with its multi-GeV \u03bc-like\nsample. However, SK cannot safely test if an oscillation dip is present. This kind of studies\nneeds a dedicated future detector [81].\nThe SK collaboration probes sterile effects in another more direct way: selecting a sample\nof NC-enriched events [71]. In absence of a precise description of the cuts performed to obtain\nthe NC-enrichment, we have not included this sample (as also done in previous reanalyses of SK\ndata). The 'minimal' active/sterile configuration is more strongly constrained indirectly by the\n24\n\nWe thank K. Eitel and M. Steidl for giving us the table of the Karmen likelihood, and B. Louis and G.

The plot is symmetric under tan \u03b8s \u2194 1/ tan \u03b8s so that we only show tan \u03b8s \u2264 1.\nzenith-angle spectra. We estimate that this remains true in most of the parameter space, and\nconsequently we do not include in our final results our approximate reanalysis of NC-enriched\ndata.\nAs in the solar case, we looked if present data contain some evidence for sterile effects which\ncorrect in a minor way many observables, by searching for local minima of the global \u03c72 . No\nstatistically significant hint is found: since subleading sterile effects do not improve the global fit\nin a significant way (at most by \u2206\u03c72 \u2248 4) our plots only show excluded regions. The excluded\nregion in fig.s 12d, e (which correspond to \u03bd\u03bc /\u03bds and to \u03bd\u03c4 /\u03bds mixing) extends down to \u2206m241 = 0\nbecause even in this limit there are sterile oscillations at the atmospheric and solar frequencies.\nIt is useful to compare the sensitivity of the two classes of experiments, 1) and 2). Since\nthere are no MSW resonances, all these experiments are sensitive only to relatively large sterile\nmixing, \u03b8s >\n\u223c 0.1. Sterile mixing with \u03bde (and with the \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 mass eigenstates that contain\na sizable \u03bde fraction) is better probed by reactor experiments, although e-like events at SK\nextend the sensitivity down to smaller values of \u2206m2 .

Green dot-dashed lines: Pe\u03bc = 0.01. Red dotted lines: |\u2206P\u03bc\u03c4 | = 0.01 at\nCNGS.\nsterile effects detectable by the experiments discussed in this section are already disfavoured by\nmeasurements of the primordial 4 He abundancy, and can be fully tested by future CMB or BBN\ndata.\nA detailed analysis of capabilities of future beam or reactor neutrinos as probes of sterile neutrinos seems not necessary. In fact, there are many proposals motivated by other considerations,\nand in each case it is easy to compute sterile effects. We only make a few general comments.\nThe blue dashed line in fig.s 11 shows what can achieved by a future high-precision shortbaseline reactor experiment able of detecting a 2% deficit in the \u03bd\u0304e flux [82]. Sterile oscillations\ngive a \u03bd\u0304e deficit, which might be energy-dependent if the sterile oscillation length at E\u03bd \u223c\nfew MeV is comparable to the base-line L. Both are unknown; we assumed L \u223c 2 km. Most of\nthe explorable region at small \u2206m2 is already excluded by solar and atmospheric experiments.\nThe region with large \u2206m2 \u223c eV2 is more difficult because even a near detector only sees\naveraged oscillations; one has to rely on theoretical predictions for the total flux of reactor\n\u03bd\u0304e [83].\n38\n\n\fSterile oscillations with large \u2206m2 \u223c eV2 have a wave-length comparable to the earth radius\nat energies E\u03bd \u223c TeV: experiments such as AUGER and IceCube can study atmospheric\nneutrinos in this energy range, and could see an anomalous zenith-angle dependence if \u03b8s is large\nenough [84].\nFuture atmospheric experiment such as Monolith [81] could test if the first oscillation dip is\npresent as predicted by \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 oscillations. Sterile effects with \u2206m2 \u223c \u2206m2atm can significantly\ndistort the expected oscillation pattern.\nDistortions not related to earth matter effects can also be searched by the planned \u03bd\u03bc -beam\nexperiments. Furthermore, the MINOS detector can statistically distinguish NC/CC events\nthat are tagged as short/ long tracks, and it should be possible to measure the NC rate with 5%\nprecision [85]. The blue dashed lines in fig.s 12 correspond to a 5% and 1% anomaly in the NC\ntotal rate in a \u03bd\u03bc beam experiment with L = 730 km and Minos-like parent energy spectrum.\nA sterile neutrino can also manifest as \u03bd\u03c4 appearance: considering a CNGS-like beam [86] in\nfig.s 12 we show iso-curves corresponding to an average \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 conversion probability \u00b10.01\ndifferent from atmospheric oscillations only (which give a conversion probability of about 0.02,\ndepending on the precise value of \u2206m2atm and on the average energy of the beam).\nConstraints from reactor experiments make more difficult, but not impossible, to have detectable \u03bde appearance in a \u03bd\u03bc beam (or \u03bd\u03bc appearance in a \u03bde beam) as signals of active/sterile\noscillations. In experiments sensitive to atmospheric oscillations a non zero \u03b813 gives such effects. Assuming \u03b813 = 0, in fig. 12 we show iso-curves corresponding to a \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde conversion\nprobability of 0.01.\n\n6.3\n\nHints and anomalies\n\nTo conclude, we list some possibly anomalous features of present data:\n\u2022 The total rate of e-like events at SK is higher than the expected central value. The \u03bc/e\nratio seems to be too low (see e.g. [87]). Constraints from solar, atmospheric and shortbaseline data show that sterile neutrinos can reduce the \u03bc rate (e.g. in the case of \u03bd\u03bc /\u03bds\nmixing with \u2206m214 \u223c 10\u22124 eV2 ) but cannot increase the e rate.\n\u2022 The total rate of trough-going muons at SK is higher than the expected central value.\nPredictions and direct measurements of cosmic ray primaries at the relevant energies are\ndifficult [88].\n\u2022 The LSND result [4], discussed below.\n\n6.4\n\nLSND\n\nThe LSND experiment [4] finds an evidence for \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e , that ranges between 3 to 7\u03c3 depending\non how data are analyzed. It is difficult to conceive new physics that can explain the LSND\nresult compatibly with all other constraints. Among reasonably conservative interpretations,\na sterile neutrino with eV-scale mass seems to be the less disfavoured possibility [89, 52, 6].\nAccording to this interpretation the LSND anomaly arises as \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bds \u2192 \u03bde so that the effective\n39\n\n\f102\n99% CL (2 dof)\n\n\u03a9\u03bd h2 > 0.01\n\n1\n\nLS\n\nND\n\nN\u03bd\n\n\u2206 m2LSND in eV2\n\n10\n\n>\n\n10\u2212 2\n\n3.8\n\n10\u2212 1\n\nallowed\n10\u2212 5\n\n10\u2212 4\n\nnon\u2212stan\ndard BBN\n10\u2212 3\n10\u2212 2\n2\nsin 2\u03b8LSND\n\nexcluded\n10\u2212 1\n\n1\n\nFigure 13: The LSND anomaly interpreted as oscillations of 3+1 neutrinos.

This formula is valid only for small\nmixing angles, and eq. (2) gives the general expression. This prediction gives rise to 3 problems:\n1) \u03bde and \u03bd\u03bc disappearance experiments imply that \u03b8es are \u03b8\u03bcs are somewhat smaller than\nwhat suggested by LSND [89, 52, 6];\n2) standard BBN predicts that the sterile neutrino thermalizes, so that primordial abundances\nshould have values corresponding to N\u03bd = 4 [90];\n3) according to standard cosmology, the sterile neutrino gives a contribution to the neutrino\ndensity \u03a9\u03bd somewhat larger than what suggested by global fit of CMB and LSS data (see\ne.g. [91]).\nConcerning points 2) and 3), there is not yet general consensus that the sterile neutrino thermalizes, maybe because this LSND issue has never been analyzed by authors that performed,\nat the same time, a precise study of neutrino data and of cosmology with mixed neutrinos. Estimates indicate that the region favoured by LSND lies well inside the region where the sterile\nneutrino is thermalized [90]. This is confirmed by our analysis, shown in fig. 13. In the relevant region the constraint on \u03a9\u03bd is well approximated by the horizontal line corresponding to\n\u03a9\u03bd h2 = m4 /93.5 eV, as assumed in previous analyses [91, 6]. The accurately computed constraint\nstarts to be weaker only at much smaller values of the effective \u03b8LSND mixing angle.\nIn fig. 13 the BBN constraint has been minimized (when allowed by neutrino data) setting\n1/2\n\u03b8es \u2248 \u03b8\u03bcs \u2248 \u03b8LSND . We see that short-baseline experiments sensible to a P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ) about 2\norders of magnitude smaller than the value suggested by LSND are needed to probe regions\ncompatible with standard BBN.\n40\n\n\f7\n\nSummary\n\nA few years ago active/sterile oscillations were studied as an alternative to active/active oscillations. For example, it was shown that neither the solar nor the atmospheric anomaly can\nbe produced by oscillations into sterile neutrinos compatibly with standard BBN. These active\nvs sterile issues have now been firmly solved by experiments, and the new relevant questions\nbecome:\nHow large can be the subdominant sterile component possibly present in solar or\natmospheric oscillations? How can we discover new anomalies due to sterile effects?\nIn order to address these issues we systematically compared oscillation effects generated by one\nsterile neutrino (including the effects of the now established solar and atmospheric oscillations)\nwith present experiments and studied capabilities of future probes, extending previous analyses\nin several ways. Almost all previous analyses that studied these new questions considered only\nthe peculiar sterile oscillation pattern that gives the simplest physics: the sterile neutrino mixes\nwith a specific flavour (\u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 in solar analyses, \u03bd\u03c4 in atmospheric ones) and has a large mass,\n\u2206m2 \u226b \u2206m2atm,sun . Dropping each one of these assumptions gives quite different physics. We\nexplored the whole parameter space (three sterile mixing parameters and one sterile mass)\nproducing precise results for six representative slices, that span the spectrum of the various\npossibilities. We considered one extra sterile neutrino with arbitrary mass m4 , and allowed it to\nmix with\n\u03bde or \u03bd\u03bc or \u03bd\u03c4 or \u03bd1 or \u03bd2 or \u03bd3\nwhere \u03bd1,2,3 are the mass eigenstates in absence of sterile mixing. The spectrum of active neutrinos is not yet fully known: rather than studying all possible cases we focussed on what we believe\nis most plausible case: we assumed normal hierarchy of active neutrinos (i.e. m1 \u226a m2 \u2248 m3 /6)\nand that \u03b813 is small enough that we can neglect its effects. If experiments will contradict\nthese assumptions, it will be easy to update our results; most of them do not depend on these\nassumptions.\nWe considered the most promising ways to probe the existence of eV-scale sterile neutrinos.\nMost probes are based on a careful study of natural sources of neutrinos (the universe, the\nsun, supernovae, cosmic rays,...) which have their own peculiar capabilities and limitations. We\nstudied how one extra sterile neutrino affects BBN (helium-4, deuterium), CMB, LSS and solar,\natmospheric, reactor, beam experiments. The sensitivity of some of these probes is enhanced\nby MSW resonances [23]. In cosmology, active \u03bd and \u03bd\u0304 encounter a MSW resonance with\nsterile neutrinos lighter than active ones. Roughly the same happens to supernova \u03bd\u0304e (that also\nexperience less important MSW resonances in the opposite situation).

The shaded region is excluded at 99%\nC.L. (2 dof ) by solar or atmospheric or reactor or short base-line experiments. We shaded as\nexcluded also regions where sterile neutrinos suppress the SN1987A \u03bd\u0304e rate by more than 70%.\nThis rate is suppressed by more than 20% inside the dashed blue line, that can be explored at the\nnext SN explosion if it will be possible to understand the collapse well enough. Within standard\ncosmology, the region above the red continuous line is disfavoured (maybe already excluded) by\nBBN and LSS. Plots in the various sections show how much each probe can be improved by future\nexperiments.\n\n42\n\n\f4\n\nabundancy (that we parameterize in terms of an effective number of neutrinos N\u03bd He , see\n4\neq. (4)) until N\u03bd He = 4 will be safely tested. This requires overcoming 'systematic' uncertainties. The helium-4 abundancy is sensitive to two different sterile effects: increase of the\n4\ntotal neutrino density, and depletion of electron-neutrinos. The second effect makes N\u03bd He\nsensitive to sterile oscillations down to \u2206m2 \u223c 10\u22128 eV2 , while the first effect becomes\n2\n\u22125\nnegligible at \u2206m2 <\n\u223c 10 eV .\n\nHowever, if BBN were non-standard, a modified density of electron neutrinos could com4\npensate the sterile corrections to N\u03bd He : for example helium-4 constraints on sterile oscillations can be evaded by allowing a large neutrino asymmetry.\n\n\u2022 For all these reasons it is important to measure a second BBN effect. The deuterium\nprimordial abundancy is affected by milder systematic problems: in the future it might be\npossible to improve its measurement obtaining an uncertainty on the effective parameter\nN\u03bdD (precisely defined in eq. (4))) significantly below 1, possibly making deuterium the\nmost significant BBN probe. We have computed the ranges of active/sterile oscillation\nparameters that significantly affect N\u03bdD : it is less sensitive than helium-4 to \u03bde depletion\nand therefore to values of \u2206m2 below 10\u22125 eV2 (fig. 3).\n\u2022 Future studies of Cosmic Microwave Background acoustic oscillations should allow to\nprecisely measure the total neutrino density N\u03bdCMB at recombination (T \u223c eV) with \u00b10.2\n(Planck) or maybe \u00b10.05 (CMBpol) error [17]. Neutrinos affect CMB in various ways;\nneutrino free-streaming offers a clean signature that allows to count neutrinos. Sterile\n4\n2\n\u22125\nCMB\nneutrinos affect N\u03bdCMB only if \u2206m2 >\n\u2248 N\u03bd He \u2248 N\u03bdD .\n\u223c 10 eV ; in such a case N\u03bd\nTherefore CMB will cover only a part of the region that BBN could probe with fully\nreliable measurements of the helium-4 or deuterium abundances.\n\u2022 CMB also allows to probe eV-scale \u03bd masses. Smaller \u03bd masses can be probed by measuring how much galaxies are clustered, because neutrinos become non relativistic when\nthe observable universe had a size comparable to present cluster of galaxies. Relativistic\nneutrinos freely move and tend to reduce the amount of clustering. Recently, Large Scale\nStructure data (together with precise CMB measurements) gave a bound on the present\nenergy density in neutrinos \u03a9\u03bd < 0.0076 at 95 % C.L. [8, 19], dominated by neutrino\nmasses (rather than neutrino energy). With only active neutrinos this implies a significant\nbound on their mass, m\u03bd < 0.23 eV [8, 19].\nSterile neutrinos contribute to \u03a9\u03bd (a small non-thermal population of relatively heavy\nsterile neutrinos also modifies the way \u03a9\u03bd manifests). For small active/sterile mixing LSS\nconstrains sterile oscillations more strongly than BBN (fig. 3).\n\u2022 Solar \u03bde experiments have explored sterile oscillations not testable by BBN, thanks to\ntwo different effects. (1) MSW resonances make solar \u03bde sensitive to small active/sterile\n2\n\u22128\n2\nmixing and \u2206m2 >\n\u223c 10 eV . (2) With large mixing, solar \u03bde are sensitive down to \u2206m \u223c\n2\n10\u221212 eV . Future experiments will explore new aspects of the solar neutrino anomaly,\nallowing to measure in a redundant way the active oscillation parameters or to discover\na new anomaly. We emphasize one qualitative point. Due to LMA oscillations, neutrinos\nexit from the sun as almost pure \u03bd2 at energies E\u03bd >\n\u223c few MeV. Neutrinos with these\n43\n\n\fenergies have been precisely studied by SK and SNO, but are almost unaffected by sterile\noscillations if they involve mostly \u03bd1 . This could happen either when \u03bds mixes with \u03bd1 ,\nor when \u03bds experiences a level-crossing with \u03bd1 . Therefore there is a whole class of sterile\neffects which manifest only at E\u03bd <\n\u223c few MeV - an energy range explored so far only by\nGallium experiments. Future precise measurement of solar \u03bde at sub-MeV energies will\nallow to significantly extend searches for active/sterile effects. Part of these extended\nregion can be soon tested by Borexino, where a sterile neutrino can manifest as day/night\nvariations, or as seasonal variations, or even by reducing the total rate.\n\u2022 Supernova neutrinos will be good probes of sterile oscillations because have a different\npattern of MSW resonances and a longer base-line than solar \u03bde . Consequently supernova\n2\n\u221218\n\u03bd\u0304e are more sensitive than solar \u03bde in two main cases: (a) small \u2206m2 >\n\u223c 10 eV with\nlarge \u03b8s ; (b) \u03bds lighter than \u03bd1 with small mixing. Oscillations into one sterile neutrino can\nreduce the \u03bd\u0304e rate by up to 80% (see fig.s 9) and, in a more restricted range of oscillation\nparameters, vary the average \u03bd\u0304e energy by 30%. SN1987A data agreed with expectations.\nFuture SN experiments can perform quantitative test, but it is not clear how to deal with\ntheoretical uncertainties. We also discussed other less promising astrophysical probes.\n\u2022 Atmospheric experiments (SK, MACRO, K2K) indirectly exclude active/sterile oscilla\u22123\u00f74\ntions with \u2206m2 >\neV2 and tan2 \u03b8s >\n\u223c 0.1 \u00f7 0.2. Up to minor differences, this applies\n\u223c 10\nto all flavours (fig. 12). Terrestrial experiments that mainly probed disappearance of\n\u03bd\u0304e and \u03bd\u03bc (Chooz, CDHS,. . . ) exclude active/sterile mixings with these flavours with\n2\n2\n\u22123\ntan2 \u03b8s >\n\u223c 0.03 and \u2206m >\n\u223c 10 eV (fig. 11). Therefore future short-baseline experiments\ncan search for sterile effects with smaller \u03b8s . Possible signals are \u03bd\u0304e disappearance in reactor\nexperiments, a deficit of NC events or \u03bd\u03c4 appearance in beam experiments. Within standard cosmology these effects can be probed by CMB and BBN, which already disfavour\nthem.\nWe listed present anomalies that can be interpreted as due to sterile neutrinos. None looks\nparticularly significant, with the possible exception of the LSND anomaly, that can be due\nto oscillations of '3 + 1' neutrinos. Our precise study confirms that the extra sterile neutrino\nsuggested by LSND thermalizes almost completely before BBN (in agreement with estimations\nof most previous analyses). In fig. 13 we plot, as function of the effective LSND oscillation\n4\nparameters \u03b8LSND and \u2206m2LSND , the constraints on N\u03bd He \u2243 N\u03bdD \u2243 N\u03bdCMB (mainly from helium-4\ndata) and \u03a9\u03bd (mainly from LSS data): in the relevant region our precise plot negligibly differs\nfrom previous estimates [91, 6]. The 3+1 interpretation of LSND is not compatible with standard\nBBN, and gives a \u03a9\u03bd which is only marginally compatible with standard cosmology.\n\nAcknowledgments We thank S. Woosley, A.
