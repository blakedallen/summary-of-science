A number of these materials have\nlarger spin.\nE.g.\nSrCr8\u2212x Ga4+x O19 1 with spin- 23\n2,3\nor KFe3 (OH)6 (SO4 )2\nwith spin- 25 . With growing\nspin we expect the model to exhibit some behaviour\ncaptured in the classical model. This model has been\nstudied by Chalker et al4 by Monte-Carlo, spin-wave\napproximation and low temperature expansion. Here the\n\"order-by-disorder\" scenario with coplanar ordering was\nproposed.5 Reimers et al6 have performed Monte-Carlo\nruns more systematically and could confirm some of the\npredictions, particularly coplanar ordering. Chandra\net al and Ritchey et al have extended the work and\nstudied anisotropy.7,8 A cross-over for the pure case\nand a second-order phase transition for any inclusion\nof anisotropy was proposed. More recently the classical\nHeisenberg model has been investigated by Zhitomirsky9\nwith a simulated annealing method. He found a strange\nfinite-size behaviour in the specific heat, inconsistent\nwith a phase-transition. The antiferromagnetic order\nwas shown to vanish in the thermodynamic limit and the\nso called \"octopular-order\" parameter, a third rank tensor, was proposed to describe the low temperature phase.\nSubsequently Gvozdikova et al extended the studies\nby inclusion of a magnetic field in the Hamiltonian10\nfollowing earlier work of Zhitomirsky.11 Another relevant\nstudy is by Korshunov, who studied the XY-J1 \u2212 J2\nmodel on the Kagome and found magnetically and\ntopologically ordered phases.12\nClassical models with a continuous symmetry are\ngenerally not expected to show any long-range order\nat finite temperature, except for topological order,\ndue to the theorem of Mermin and Wagner.13 For\nfrustrated models the situation is more subtle, as a\ndiscrete symmetry can be induced and this symmetry\n\ncan in principle be broken. This possibility was first\nsuggested by P. Chandra et al14 , and has been observed numerically by Weber et al,15 . Note that this\ndoes not violate the Mermin-Wagner theorem, as the\nsymmetry being broken is not a continous one, but\nan additional discrete one. Meanwhile a mathematical\nproof is published about such type of models,16 showing\nthat such induced symmetry can be broken. In the\nclassical nearest neighbor Heisenberg-model on the\nKagome (CKLNNHM), all studies of the past are not\nconsistent with a phase-transition at finite temperature.\nFeatures in the observables, such as a peculiar finite\nsize behaviour in the specific heat have been observed\nin Monte-Carlo simulations.9 We refer to this point as\n\"crossover-temperature\" in our manuscript.\nHere we investigate the extended Heisenberg model\nby inclusion of a next-nearest neighbor (NNN) coupling\nterm. The motivation for this is three-fold: First, in\nreal materials a small NNN coupling is expected; second, from observing the trends towards J2 \u2192 0 new insight to the pure model might be possible; and third, this\nmodel couples to three underlying sub-lattices which are\nagain of Kagome type (see Fig. 1). This is therefore the\nfirst study of frustration which considers the coupling\nof two frustrated lattices which to some extent \"unfrustrate\" them as the inclusion of the J2 lifts some of the\ndegeneracies. Our results show that even a very small\nJ2 -term enables an anti-ferromagnetic order. This\n\u221a\n\u221a order\nis of q = (0, 0) type for AF-coupling of J2 , and of 3\u00d7 3\ntype in the other case. For the pure case (J2 = 0) the\ncrossover temperature is tiny (Tk \u2248 0.003) this changes\nquite dramatically upon switching on the J2 -term (e.g.\nwe obtain Tc = 0.045 \u00b1 0.001 for J2 = 0.02). Away\nfrom J2 = 0 the finite-size scaling is consistent with a\nphase-transition. The universality class could be classified to some extent and was found to be of the Ising type\nfor J2 \u2248 \u00b10.02. For positive J2 which is close to J2 = 0\ntwo peaks in the specific heat are found numerically, suggesting two phase-transitions. Studying the limiting behaviour from the other side towards J2 = 0 appears to\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) The Kagome lattice, including the\nnext nearest neighbor bonds (in dashed lines). The three\nunderlying NNN-Kagome sub-lattices are shown in different\ncolours.\n\nbe numerically harder. Here the phase-transition is consistent with a first-order transition, which is apparently\nthe reason for the numerical difficulty.\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nFrom earlier work by the authors mentioned in the introduction, it was shown that the CKLNNHM is very\nhard for a numerical investigation: The interesting temperature region is very low, and the low temperature\nphase is very difficult to bring into equilibrium. The\nextension of further neighbor interaction lift some degeneracies and therefore taking away some of the numerical\n\"hardness\". Our model Hamiltonian reads:\nH = \u2212J1\n\nX\nhiji\n\nS i * S j + J2\n\nX\n(ij)\n\nSi * Sj\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the J1 term couples between nearest neighbor\npairs (indicated by solid lines in Fig. 1) and the J2 term\nbetween next-nearest neighbor pairs (indicated by dashed\nlines in Fig. 1). In the following we give J2 in units of J1 .\nS is a classical spin operator. When J2 = 0 we recover\nthe nearest neighbor model. In this case there is a large\ndegeneracy of coplanar and non-planar states. Let us\ndiscuss the possible ground states in this case: Ground\nstates can be found by rewriting the Hamiltonian from a\nnearest neighbor sum to a sum over all triangles \u03b1 as:\n\nH = \u2212J1\n\nX\nhiji\n\nSi * Sj =\n\nJ1 X\n(S1 + S2 + S3 )2 + c (2)\n2 \u03b1\n\nwhere c is a constant term. From this sum one realizes\nthe condition to minimize the energy: If the sum of\neach individual triangle is zero, this is a minimum\nenergy state. There are two groups of such states: the\ncoplanar ones, where all 3 spins lie in one plane, and the\nnon-coplanar ones, where this is not the case. We will\nfirst discuss the coplanar states and briefly mention how\n\nto obtain the non-planar ones from them. The coplanar\nstates contain two types of antiferromagnetic sub-lattice\norder pattens (see Fig. 2 thereafter AFM-states). There\nis a continuous O(2) symmetry for these states as a\nsimultaneous rotation of all spins in the plane keeps the\nenergy constant. Both variants of AFM type states are\ntwo-fold degenerate: For the q = (0, 0) state (from now\non \"AFM I\" state) there is one version with only positive\nchiralities and one state with only negative chiralities.\nChirality refers to the clockwise or anti-clockwise type\nof rotation of spins when circumferencing an elementary\ntriangular plaquette. For the other (q = (4\u03c0/3, 0) from\nnow on dubbed as \u221a\n\"AFM\u221aII\" state - this state is usually\nreferred to as the 3 \u00d7 3 structure) AFM state there\nis one version with all the up-triangles having positive\nchirality and all the down-triangles having negative\nchirality and one version where the opposite is the\ncase. For an illustration please see Fig. 2. The above\ncondition for minimizing the energy is not only full-filled\nby the two AFM states, but by all states having 3 spins\nin one plane arranged among the plaquette with 120\ndegrees. Starting with one sub-lattice, the angles are\nfixed, but the arrangement of the 3 spins can be varied.\nFor an arbitrary arrangement fullfilling the 120 degrees\ncondition there is no regular patten in chiralities. One\nmay label the 3 spins with 3 colors e.g. red, blue and\ngreen, and compose pattens where one coloured site has\nonly nearest neighbors of another colour. All coplanar\nstates can be constructed in such a manner. See Fig. 3\nfor illustration of a general planar state.\nTaking a coplanar states as a starting point, one\nmay use deformations leaving the energy unchanged to\nconstruct non-planar states: If e.g. we consider the two\nAFM states of Fig. 2 there are two types of defects:\nThe weather-vane defect for AFM II, here one rotates\nall inner spins of a hexagon along the common axis\ngiven by the outer spins, and a line-defect for the AFM\nII, where one can rotate a whole line, by the axis given\nby the neighbouring spins. The energy is kept constant\nin both cases. Considering an arbirary situation (a\ncoloured state which is neighter AFM I nor AFM II),\none can do such operations among two coloured lines.\nFrom the above discussion one realizes that the ground\nstate is highly degenerate and disordered. As mentioned\nin the introduction, previous studies proposed an\norder-by-disorder scenario: For T 6= 0 entropic selection\nfavours coplanar states over the other states. As an\norder parameter originally a nematic order parameter\nwas considered in the earlier studies. This measures the\nalignment of spins with respect to a common plane. The\ngeneral patten of 120 degree alignment, discussed above\nand being an additional symmetry is not measured by\nsuch an order parameter. The octopular tensor was\nproposed as a better choice to measure states as the one\nin Fig. 3. We follow this approach.\nFinally we turn to the situation with J2 6= 0: In

When being\nin one perfectly ordered AFM state of one manifestation\nof the chirality, one needs to overcome an energy barrier\nto reach the other one. This is different from the situation\nat J2 = 0, as there the two states can be reached with\nformation of domain walls costing zero energy. Therefore at J2 6= 0 there is a discrete Z2 symmetry for planar\nstates. The building blocks of up and down triangles possessing '+' and '-' chiralities can therefore be understood\nof taking the role of Ising variables. Note that for planar\nstates the situation is the same as in the XY-model on\nthe Kagome lattice being discussed in detail in Ref. 12.\n\n+\n-\n\n+\n-\n\n-\n\n+\n\n-\n\n+\n\n-\n\n+\n\n-\n\n+\n-\n\n+\n-\n\n-\n\n+\n-\n\n-\n\n+\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nMETHOD\n\nWe employ an improved parallel tempering (PT)\napproach,17\u201319 based on the ALPS libraries and\nparapack.21 We have tested several optimizations\nfrom the literature and finally used the following\nmethod: A suitable set of temperatures is chosen,\nthen auto-correlation-times are measured to optimize\nthe frequency of exchange steps between neighbouring\nreplicas.

Typically we used around the\n+\norder of 105 sweeps for thermalization and another 107\n+sweeps for measurements. One PT simulation consisted\nof 90 to 180 replicas. The exact amount of sweeps for\nthermalization and measurements and the number of\nreplica varies largely depending on the regime of interest.\nThe AF-coupled region close to J2 = 0 is very hard.\nAs discussed below we believe this is a consequence of\nthe nature of the phase-transition at this point. We\nhave tested our program intensively by comparing our\ndata against earlier published studies.9,22,23 The J2 term\nwas tested by noting the structure of the NNN-lattice\nbeing of 3 independent Kagome lattices of smaller size\n(see Fig 1). Choosing the couplings J1 = 0, J2 = 1\nshould therefore give similar curves in the measurements\ncompared to choosing J1 = 1, J2 = 0 when considering\nthe change in the volume-size N . Our tests left no doubt\nour program works correctly.\nTo identify possible phase-transition points, we measure the specific heat cv .

As established below at any J2 6= 0\nwe see a finite-size behaviour consistent with a finite\ntemperature phase transition. Starting from Tk , the\ncrossover temperature at J2 = 0, we see that a small\nvalue of J2 does not only enable a phase transition\nbut has a huge impact on the point of transition.\nAs expected depending on the sign of J2 we achieve\nordering of the AFM I or AFM II type. The transition\nhas been found to be of second order with 2D Ising\nuniversality class for |J2 | > 0.0075 and of first-order for\n0 > J2 >= \u22120.0075. For tiny but positive J2 two peaks\nin the specific heat are observed and a classification in\nterms of universality failed.\nThe finite-size behaviour is summed up in Fig. 5.

For q we choose\nthe two vectors corresponding to the ordering pattens\nfor the AFM I and AFM II, q = (0, 0) and q = (4\u03c0/3, 0).\nAmong the two orders the AFM I order has been shown\nto be very difficult to equilibriate for the pure case, particular cooling and warming runs starting from this state\ndiffer significantly.6 On the other hand there have been\nspeculation about possible AFM II order or correlations\nin the pure model,4,24 which have been shown to vanish for any non-zero temperature performed numerically.9\nAnother quantity of possible interest is the spin-stiffness:\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0\n-0.02\n\nAFM I\n-0.01\n\nder\n\nt or\n\nFirs\n\nAFM II\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\nJ2\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Phase-diagram of the extended\nHeisenberg-model on the Kagome lattice: Shown are the estimated transition (for non-zero J2 ) and crossover (for J2 = 0)\npoints corresponding to antiferromagnetic and octopular order. AFM I labels the phase with the q = (0, 0) antiferro\u221a\n\u221a\nmagnetic order, AFM II labels the phase with the 3 \u00d7 3\nstructure - in these two phases the octupolar order is found\nin addition to the antiferromagnetic one, IP labels the region\nbetween the two peaks of the specific heat for the positive\nJ2 -branch close to J2 = 0. The solid line indicates the transition line consistent with first order scaling laws. The dashed\nlines are those transition lines consistent with the 2D Ising\nuniversality class. For the dotted line the classification failed.\n\nand cv for four values of J2 . These are snapshots for\nthe interesting regions in the phase-diagram. For values\nof |J2 | > 0.0075 (in the picture we choose J2 = \u00b10.02)\nthere is a phase transition between the disordered and\nAFM phase. The specific heat develops a peak which\ngets narrower and higher with increasing lattice size.\nThe AFM phase is of AFM I type for negative J2\nand AFM II type for positive J2 . The position of the\npeak appears where the measured AFM-ordering has\n2\nits inflection point. At the same position TOP\nappears\nto have its onset. For smaller values of J2 the nature\nof the transition changes: For e.g. J2 = \u22120.005 the\npeak of the specific heat grows much faster compared\nto the |J2 | > 0.0075 cases. The order-parameters mAF\n2\nand TOP\nhave a more sudden change between the two\nphases. In this part there is very slow convergence when\nsimulating. To us it appears to be a first-order transition\nwhich we elaborate below. In the region close to J2 = 0\nbut with positive sign for J2 , we find another interesting\nfeature: For e.g. J2 = 0.00125 (see Fig. 5) we find two\npeaks in the specific heat, the taller one matching to\nthe inflection point of mAF the second, less dominant\n2\none matching to the onset of the TOP\nand mAF order.\nWhen observing the finite-size effect, we notice that the\nbigger peak stays almost stationary at the same position\nwith respect to the temperature, when increasing the\nsystem-size, while the smaller peak moves towards\nsmaller temperature with increasing system-size. An\n\n\f5\n\nIn Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 we plotted the development of\nthe measured quantities for a larger system size (L = 24)\nas a function of J2 . For the negative branch, one can\nsee clearly that the nature of the transition is becoming\nmore consistent with a first-order phase-transition when\ncoming closer to the point J2 = 0. In the positive\nbranch, the specific heat is changing from a very broad\nsingle peak at large J2 values to a smaller double peak\n2\nclose to J2 = 0. The octupolar order TOP\nhas a more\nsudden rise when tuning J2 towards smaller values.\nAt J2 = 0 the peak in the specific heat vanishes when\nincreasing the lattice-size, as observed by Zhitomirsky,\nsuggesting no phase transition at this point. The AFM\norder vanishes at this point in the thermodynamic\nlimit. Elsewhere, as mentioned above we note that the\ntrend of the specific heat, seems to be consistent with a\nphase-transition, this is true also for the second smaller\npeak for positive and small J2 .

Investigating the region\n2\nbetween the two peaks we found that both TOP\nand\nmAF orders are reduced in the thermodynamic limit:\n2\nan extrapolation suggests here the TOP\norder clearly to\nvanish, while for the AFM a small value may remain for\ninfinite lattice sizes. This \"phase\" therefore seems to\nresemble some of the behaviour compared to the J2 = 0\n2\ncase, which shows similar features in TOP\nand mAF .\nTwo differences of this intermediate \"phase\" compared\nto the situation at J2 = 0 can be seen: First, in the\nJ2 = 0 case the mAF order is vanishing faster than\n2\nthe TOP\n, here this trend is opposite. Second, the finte\nsize trend for the upper specific heat (the smaller one)\nseems still consistent with one at a phase-transition as\nthis peak still seem to grow taller and narrower with\nlarger system-size. Since the two peaks are quite close\nto each other, it is hard to be clear about the trend of\nthis second smaller peak, resting on top of the slope of\nthe bigger peak. This upper transition-line separates at\naround J2 = 0.002 from the main-phase boundary and\ncontinues to the point of crossover for the J2 = 0 case.\nUsing the transistion points to extrapolate to the regime\nwhere simulation is no more possible it one notices: The\nlower transition line for the positive J2 branch between\nthe AFM 2 state and the disordered phase tend to\nT \u2192 0 for J2 \u2192 0, while in the other branch the AFM 1\norder seems to vanish before reaching the J2 = 0 point.\nThis is consistent with earlier claims of a T = 0 critical\npoint for the AFM 2 transition.6,24 For J2 = 0.00125\nwe checked to which of the two peaks the spin-stiffness\nmatches (for the other cases, the spin-stiffness generally\nspeaking has the same behaviour in terms of onset and\n2\ninfliction point compared to the mAF and TOP\n). This\nis shown in Fig. 6. We observe again a similar trend\n2\ncompared with the TOP\nand mAF measurements: The\nonset matches the first peak, while the infliction point is\nmatching the broad peak.\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\n0.015\n\n0.02\n\n0.025\n\nT\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Spin-Stiffness for J2 = 0.00125 and\nseveral system sizes. Error-bars are smaller than the symbolsize.\n\nwith large values for |J2 | as here the temperature for the\npoint of transition is higher. Fitting a relation for the\ndependence of the estimate of Tc on L (we tried several\nways, one of them is the peak in cv ) to a power law gives\na value for the critical exponent of \u03bd = 0.99 \u00b1 0.05 at\nJ2 = 0.02 where the error-bar is estimated from different\nways to obtain the Tc (L). This would be consistent with\na 2D Ising universality class. To test this theory we\nfitted the height of the specific heat. For the 2D Ising\nuniversality class such a fit should not be possible, as\nthe divergence is logarithmic. Any power-law fit gives\nindeed systematic errors compared to the data, while a\nlogarithmic fit agrees well (see Fig. 9 lower panel). For a\nvalue of J2 = 0.01 we obtain \u03bd = 1.08 \u00b1 0.05, and again a\nlogarithmic divergence for the height of the specific heat.\nThis still seem to somewhat fit in this universality class.\nFor smaller values of the positive signed J2 , our data\ndoes not allow to get a consistent value for this critical\n\n\f6\nJ2=-0.005\n\n2\n\n5\n\nJ2=-0.005\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\n0.015\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n0.015\n\n-0.985\n\n-2\n\nL\n\n(-1/a2)\n\n0.054\n\n-0.98\nEnergy\n\n-0.975\n\ny=a0+a1 log(x)+a2/x\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\nT\n\n0.05\n\n0.07\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0.2\n\nJ2=0.02\nJ2=0.01\n\n0.15\n\nJ2=0.005\nJ2=0.0025\n\n0.1\n\nJ2=0.00125\nJ2=0.000625\nJ2=0.0\n\n0.05\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\nT\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\nT\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) Measurements for the positive J2 case\nof the antiferromagnetic order (mAF ) the octopular order\n2\n(TOP\n) and the specific heat cv for several values of J2 .

Therefore we see\nthat the maximum of the specific heat is proportional to\nthe volume and the position of the same peak is proportional to L\u22122 as expected for a first order transition. We\nrecorded energy-histograms and found the double-peak\nstructure a typical feature of first-order transistions.\nObtaining this histogram was somewhat challenging,\nsince it converges very slowly and seem to appear only\nvery close to the transition point (as we show in Fig.\n9). We needed 6 digits for the temperature to find two\npeaks and 20 mill. sweeps for measurements. From\nour observations we estimate the change from secondorder to first-order behaviour taking place at around\nJ2 \u2248 \u22120.0075 \u00b1 0.002, here a tricritical point is expected.\nThere are several possible scenarios how a second-order\nphase transition changes to become a first-order one\nwhen tuning parameters,26 an analysis of the underlying mechanism causing this, we leave for future studies.\nWe investigated the magnetic structure factor, to see\nthe impact of the inclusion of the J2 -term on this quantity. For large |J2 | we have chosen two temperatures, one\nabove the transition (T = 0.1) and one below (T = 0.02).\nFor the small |J2 | cases we chose two more very low\ntemperatures T = 0.005 and T = 0.002, the structure\nfor these two very low temperatures is the same, therefore we included only T = 0.005 in Fig. 10. As the\nKagome lattice is not bi-partite, the structure factor extents over several Brilouin zones. For high temperatures\nwe observe the diffuse Bow-tie structure, as in the pure\nKagome Lattice,9 and as in related lattices such as the\n\n\f7\nT=0.1, J2=-0.02\n\n8\u03c0\n\n6\n\n'-' using 1:2:3\n\n7\u03c0\n\n5\n\n6\u03c0\n\n4\n\n5\u03c0\n\nT=0.020186, J2=-0.02\n\n8\u03c0\n\n80\n\n6\u03c0\n\n60\n\n5\u03c0\n3\n\n4\u03c0\n\n40\n\n4\u03c0\n2\n\n3\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n3\n\n8\u03c0\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0 3\u03c0 4\u03c0 5\u03c0 6\u03c0 7\u03c0 8\u03c0\n\nT=0.1, J2=-0.000625\n\n8\u03c0\n\n'-' using 1:2:3\n\n7\u03c0\n\n2.5\n\n6\u03c0\n\n2\n\n5\u03c0\n\n20\n\n3\u03c0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n100\n\n'-' using 1:2:3\n\n7\u03c0\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0 3\u03c0 4\u03c0 5\u03c0 6\u03c0 7\u03c0 8\u03c0\n\nT=0.02, J2=-0.000625\n\n7\u03c0\n\n4\n3.5\n\n6\u03c0\n\n2.5\n\n4\u03c0\n\n3\u03c0\n\n0.5\n\n2\u03c0\n\nT=0.00502564, J2=-0.000625\n8\u03c0\n\n100\n\n'-' using 1:2:3\n\n7\u03c0\n\n80\n\n6\u03c0\n\n60\n\n3\n\n5\u03c0\n1\n\n4.5\n\n'-' using 1:2:3\n\n1.5\n\n4\u03c0\n\n-40\n\n2\n\n3\u03c0\n\n1.5\n1\n\n2\u03c0\n\n5\u03c0\n40\n\n4\u03c0\n20\n\n3\u03c0\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n0.5\n\n\u03c0\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0 3\u03c0 4\u03c0 5\u03c0 6\u03c0 7\u03c0 8\u03c0\n\nT=0.1, J2=0.000625\n\n8\u03c0\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n3\n\n'-' using 1:2:3\n\n7\u03c0\n\n2.5\n\n6\u03c0\n\n2\n\n5\u03c0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0 3\u03c0 4\u03c0 5\u03c0 6\u03c0 7\u03c0 8\u03c0\n\nT=0.0197641, J2=0.000625\n\n8\u03c0\n\n7\u03c0\n\n6\u03c0\n\n6\n\n6\u03c0\n\n5\u03c0\n\n5\n\n5\u03c0\n\n4\n\n0.5\n\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n8\u03c0\n\n7\n\n4\u03c0\n1\n\n3\u03c0\n\n8\n\n'-' using 1:2:3\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n2\u03c0 3\u03c0 4\u03c0 5\u03c0 6\u03c0 7\u03c0 8\u03c0\n\n-40\n\nT=0.00502813, J2=0.000625\n\n7\u03c0\n\n1.5\n\n4\u03c0\n\n-0.5\n\n\u03c0\n\n50\n\n'-' using 1:2:3\n\n40\n\n30\n\n4\u03c0\n\n20\n\n3\n\n3\u03c0\n\n2\n\n2\u03c0\n\n3\u03c0\n\n1\n\n2\u03c0\n\n10\n\n\u03c0\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0 3\u03c0 4\u03c0 5\u03c0 6\u03c0 7\u03c0 8\u03c0\n\nT=0.1, J2=0.02\n\n8\u03c0\n\n7\n\n8\u03c0\n\n7\u03c0\n\n6\n\n7\u03c0\n\n6\u03c0\n\n5\n\n6\u03c0\n\n5\u03c0\n\n4\n\n5\u03c0\n\n4\u03c0\n\n3\n\n4\u03c0\n\n3\u03c0\n\n2\n\n3\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n1\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n'-' using 1:2:3\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0 3\u03c0 4\u03c0 5\u03c0 6\u03c0 7\u03c0 8\u03c0\n\nT=0.0202211, J2=0.02\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0 3\u03c0 4\u03c0 5\u03c0 6\u03c0 7\u03c0 8\u03c0\n\n100\n\n'-' using 1:2:3\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0 3\u03c0 4\u03c0 5\u03c0 6\u03c0 7\u03c0 8\u03c0\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\u03c0 3\u03c0 4\u03c0 5\u03c0 6\u03c0 7\u03c0 8\u03c0\n\n-40\n\nFIG. 10: Magnetic structure factor for L = 9 systems for several values of J2 and for the relevant temperature range.\n\nPyrochlore.27 The structure appears for all investigated\nvalues for J2 but at different temperatures. Lowering the\ntemperature, from there we find qualitatively the same\nstructure than for the J2 = 0 case for positive sign of\nJ2 (3 peaks at the center of the bow-tie prevailing). For\nnegative J2 with the other AFM ordering for the lowtemperature phase, three peaks at the boundary of the\ntriangle of the bow-tie develop, when lowering the temperature. In both cases the lowest energy plots finally\nshow pinch points at the AFM ordering vectors for the\nstate concerned but with an increased periodicity, while\nat high temperature the correlations are similar to the\nJ2 = 0 case. This can be seen from our plots in Fig. 10:\nFor e.g. the tiny values of |J2 | shown (J2 = \u22120.000625\nand J2 = 0.000625) at T = 0.1 we are above the transition and observe the Bow-tie structure, from there the\npinch points develop when lowering this temperature to\naround T = 0, 005. For larger |J2 | the temperature\n\nT = 0.1 is already within the AFM phase, therefore one\nsees the development of the pinch points already at this\ntemperature. This means that aside of very low temperatures the additional J2 term seem not to have much\nimpact on the correlations.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTo sum up, we have extended earlier work on the\nclassical Heisenberg model on the Kagome lattice, by\nstudying the inclusion of next-nearest neighbor interactions. This is relevant for real systems and a good way\nto gain further insight to the nearest neighbor model.\nWe see that tiny values of J2 have a big impact on this\nmodel by enabling finite-temperature phase transition,\nwith larger transition temperature compared to the\ncrossover point for J2 = 0. This suggests that in real\n\n\f8\nmaterials having large spin on this lattice AFM order\nwill be observed. The nature of the phase-transition\nhas been explored, and it was found to fit the 2-D Ising\nuniversality-class for |J2 | \u2265 0.01, and shows consistency\nwith a first order phase transition at the negative branch\nclose to J2 = 0. As the underlying induced symmetry\nis Z2 an Ising transistion appears reasonable. How\nthis transistion changes towards first-order might be\nan intersting point for future studies. For the tiny and\npositive J2 case, two peaks in the specific heat develop,\nthe second (in terms of higher temperature) most likely\nconnecting further to the crossover point for the J2 = 0\ncase. This is an interesting point for the nearest neighbor\nmodel and a possible line of attack for future studies.\nWe notice that the lower transition line for the positive\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n10\n\n11\n12\n13\n\n14\n\nJ2 branch between the AFM 2 state and the disordered\nphase tend to T \u2192 0 for J2 \u2192 0, while in the other\nbranch the AFM 1 order seems to vanish before reaching\nthe J2 = 0 point. This is consistent with earlier claims\nof a T = 0 critical point for the AFM 2 transition.\nThere seem to be no qualitative impact on the spin\nstructure factor when tuning J2 . The region very close\nto J2 = 0 remains still very interesting and should be\nfurther studied by analytic and numeric methods.\nAcknowledgements: We wish to thank S.
