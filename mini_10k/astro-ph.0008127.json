We show that these electrons fit the\npopulation of seed relativistic electrons that is postulated in many models for\nthe origin of cluster radio halos. If the magnetic field has a central value of\n3 \u00f7 30 \u03bcG (depending on the Dark Matter profile) and is radially decreasing from\nthe cluster center, the population of seed relativistic electrons from neutralino\nannihilation can fit the radio halo spectra of two well studied cluster: Coma and\n1E0657-56. The shape and the frequency extension of the radio halo spectra\nare connected with the mass and physical composition of the neutralino. A\npure-gaugino neutralino with mass M\u03c7 \u2265 80 GeV can reasonably fit the radio\nhalo spectra of both Coma and 1E0657-56. This model provides a number of\nextra predictions that make it definitely testable. On the one hand, it agrees\nquite well with the observations that (i) the radio halo is centered on the cluster\ndynamical center, usually coincident with the center of its X-ray emission,\n(ii) the radio halo surface brightness is similar to the X-ray one, and (iii) the\nmonochromatic radio power at 1.4 GHz correlates strongly with the IC gas\ntemperature. On the other hand, the same model predicts that radio halos\nshould be present in every cluster, which is not actually observed, although\nthe predicted radio halo luminosities can change by factors up to \u223c 102 \u00f7 106 ,\ndepending on the amplitude and the structure of the intracluster magnetic\nfield.

In fact, if DM is constituted by weakly\ninteracting massive particles (WIMP's), their annihilation can produce direct and indirect\nsignals such as observable fluxes of positrons (Silk and Srednicki 1984, Rudaz and Stecker\n1988, Ellis et al. 1989, Stecker and Tylka 1989, Kamionkowski and Turner 1991, Baltz\nand Edsj\u00f6 1998), antiprotons (Chardonnet et al. 1996, Bottino et al. 1998), gamma-rays\n(Bengtsson et al. 1990, Chardonnet et al. 1995) and neutrinos (Silk and Gondolo 1999)\nfrom the Milky Way halo.\nMotivated by these results, we explore here some specific consequences of the\nproduction of positrons and electrons from the WIMP interaction in massive DM halos like\nclusters of galaxies. The decays of WIMP annihilation products (fermions, bosons, etc.)\nyield, among other particles, energetic electrons and positrons up to energies comparable to\nthe WIMP mass (usually of the order of tens to hundreds GeV). It is straightforward to\nrealize that these energetic electrons and positrons (hereafter we will refer to these particles\nas electrons because their distinction is not essential for our purposes) can emit synchrotron\nradiation in a DM halo which is filled with a magnetic field at the level of \u03bcG. Clusters of\ngalaxies are the largest bound systems which have indeed both the largest amount of DM\nand extended Intra Cluster (IC) magnetic field at the level of a few \u03bcG. It is then natural to\nexpect that the WIMP annihilation products can give origin to an extended radio emission.\nExtended radio halos and relics are observed, at present, in more than 40 galaxy\nclusters (see, e.g., Owen et al. 1999, Feretti 1999, Giovannini 1999, Liang et al. 2000).\nCluster radio halos show, generally, a regular morphology, which is similar to the X-ray\nmorphology, a low surface brightness, and a steep radio spectrum, J(\u03bd) \u223c \u03bd \u2212\u03b1r , with\n\u03b1r \u223c 1 \u00f7 1.5. The level of polarization in the radio halo emission is usually <\n\u223c 10% (Feretti\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n1999, Liang 2000). The radio halo sizes are typically of (0.5 \u00f7 1)h\u22121\n50 Mpc, and are centered\non the X-ray emission of the cluster. Their radio halo luminosity at 1.4 GHz, J1.4 , correlates\nstrongly with the cluster IC gas temperature, T , and with its X-ray luminosity, LX , mainly\nproduced by thermal bremsstrahlung emission (see Colafrancesco 1999, 2000, Liang et al.\n2000). This result points to a strong correlation between the physical state and origin\nof the relativistic electrons and the thermal content and distribution of the IC gas (see\nColafrancesco 1999 , 2000 for a more extended discussion).\nWhile we have a definite evidence for the existence of central radio halos in more than\n20 rich clusters (see Section 6 below), the physical origin of such extended radio halos is\nstill a matter of debate. The main difficulty in explaining the radio halo properties arises\nfrom the combination of their large size (\u223c 1 Mpc) and the short lifetimes (\u223c 108 \u2212 109\nyears) for synchrotron radiating electrons. Moreover, also the origin and the evolution of\nthe IC magnetic field is still unclear (see, e.g., Kronberg 1994 for a review).\nSuccessful models for the origin of non-thermal, diffuse radio emission from galaxy\nclusters have been proposed in the context of the possible cosmic ray acceleration\nmechanisms in the intra cluster medium (hereafter ICM). Synchrotron emission from a\npopulation of relativistic electrons (Jaffe 1977, Rephaeli 1977, Roland 1981) accelerated \u2013\nor reaccelerated in situ (Schlikeiser 1987) \u2013 as primary cosmic rays (see Sarazin 1999 and\nreferences therein), or produced in situ as secondary products of pp collisions (Dennison\n1980, Vestrand 1982; see also more recently Blasi and Colafrancesco 1999 and references\ntherein) can reproduce the observed spectra of the radio halo emission from Coma (see\nGiovannini and Feretti 1996, Deiss et al. 1997 for an observational review). In all these\nmodels for the origin of radio halos, one needs a substantial energy supply to maintain the\nbrightness of the radio halo for a time comparable with the Hubble time. The possibility\nthat such energy budget can be supplied to a radio halo from shocks and turbulence induced\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nby strong cluster mergers (Sarazin 1999, Takizawa 2000) is suggested by the evidence\nthat several radio halo clusters (e.g., A1656, A2255, A2163, A2319, A665) are undergoing\na merger event. The shock waves produced by strong mergers could accelerate primary\ncosmic rays and amplify the IC magnetic field (see Roettiger 1999) to produce substantial\nradio powers. However, there are also some other clusters which still show extended radio\nhalos (e.g., A2256, A2319, and other clusters found recently by Giovannini et al. 1999) but\nare either in a pre-merger state or even there is no clear merging event occurring. Moreover,\nthere are also a few small-size radio halos found in clusters which have cooling flows (e.g.,\nPerseus, A85, A2218 and maybe A2254). Therefore, one is bound to assume that: i) the\nenergy released during the very early phases of the merging process is sufficient to power\nthe central radio halo; or ii) the electrons are efficiently reaccelerated by the turbulent gas\nmotion originated from IC turbulence and/or the galaxy motion within the cluster (Deiss\net al. 1997); or iii) there exists a population of cosmic ray protons accelerated by galaxy\nactivity and/or early cluster mergers which are stored for long times (see, Colafrancesco and\nBlasi 1998) in the cluster and produce in situ high-energy secondary electrons providing\nthe long-living radio halos (Blasi and Colafrancesco 1999). So, while the energy needed for\nthe maintenance of a radio halo can be reasonably accounted for, the origin of the seed\nrelativistic electrons is not yet fully clear.\nIn this paper we explore the possibility that the diffuse radio halo emission observed\nin many clusters is produced by high-energy electrons resulting from the decay of the\nannihilation products of DM particles, like WIMP's. Among the WIMP's candidates,\nwe consider in particular the lightest neutralino \u03c7, that is predicted in supersymmetric\nextensions of the Standard Model (Haber and Kane 1985, Jungman et al. 1996). The \u03c7\nmass is expected to be in the range of tens to hundreds GeV. The detailed interaction\nproperties of the neutralino are determined once its physical composition is fixed. Indeed,\nneutralinos are a linear combinations of two Higgsinos (supersymmetric partners of the\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nHiggs bosons) and two gauginos (supersymmetric partners of the neutral gauge bosons).\nBoth the neutralino mass and its physical composition affect in general the rate and the\nfinal state composition of the \u03c7\u03c7 annihilation process. Recent analysis of accelerator\nconstraints, combined with cosmological DM requirements (Ellis et al. 2000), points to: i)\na lightest neutralino heavier than about 46 GeV; ii) a lightest neutralino that is either a\npure gaugino or a heavily mixed gaugino-Higgsino state, since a predominantly Higgsino\nstate cannot provide a substantial component of the dark matter.\nAccording to their physical composition and mass, neutralinos can annihilate either\ninto fermion pairs or into vector (or Higgs) boson pairs. In general, for a pure-gaugino \u03c7 the\nannihilation into fermion pairs is dominant. Due to the chiral structure of the initial state,\nthe annihilation cross section inside a halo grows with the square of the final fermion mass\n(see, e.g., Turner and Wilczek 1990), giving larger rates for heavier fermions. Hence, for\npure gauginos, a continuum electron spectrum will arise both from the leptonic decays of b\nand c quarks and \u03c4 leptons, and from the decays of \u03c0's originating from the fragmentation\nof quark pairs. On the other hand, when the \u03c7 higgsino component is not negligible and\nM\u03c7 > MW , the annihilation into W W (or ZZ) pairs can become dominant. In this case,\nthe electron spectrum will arise partly from the leptonic direct W (or Z) decays (giving rise\nto energetic electron of energy \u223c M\u03c7 /2), and partly from the hadronic vector boson decays,\ngiving rise to electrons through both the leptonic heavy-quarks decays and \u03c0's decays.\nIn this paper, we bypass all the complicancies deriving from a detailed study of the\nsupersymmetric parameter dependence of the neutralino annihilation cross sections, by\nadopting the following simplified framework, that will anyway reproduce the crucial features\nof the problem at hand:\na) we will assume a given value for the neutralino annihilation cross section, which is both\nrelevant for the DM closure density and inside the allowed range of the supersymmetric\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nneutralino cross sections for a given M\u03c7 and neutralino composition. A different value of\nthe cross section can then be straightforwardly rescaled from our results, as we will discuss\nin the paper;\nb) we will study the electron energy spectrum arising from the decays of the neutralino\nannihilation products in the two distinct situations where the dominant annihilation is\neither into fermions or into vector bosons. A realistic case will be, of course, close to either\nthese two or to a linear combination of them.\nThis simplified scheme will be representative of a wide range of supersymmetric models\nthat are relevant for the DM problem.\nThe plan of the paper is the following. In Section 2 we discuss the annihilation process\nof neutralinos in the DM halos of galaxy clusters, and in Section 3 we give an analytical\napproximation for the source spectrum of high-energy electrons produced from the decay\nof the secondary products of \u03c7\u03c7 annihilation. In this Section we also derive the electron\nequilibrium spectrum. In Section 4 we evaluate the radio halo spectrum and its brightness\nprofile from synchrotron emission of the relativistic e\u00b1 and the level of ICS emission from\nthe same population of electrons. In Section 5 we discuss the specific cases of the radio\nhalos found in Coma and in the cluster 1E0657-56 and in Section 6 we show how the\npresent model is able to reproduce the J1.4 \u2212 T relation. We summarize the results of this\npaper and discuss the relevance of the present model for the origin of cluster radio halos in\nSection 7. The relevant physical quantities are calculated using H0 = 50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and\na flat( \u03a90 = 1) CDM dominated cosmological model.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n2.\n\nNeutralino annihilation in galaxy clusters\n\nNeutralinos decouple from the primeval plasma when they are no longer relativistic.\nTheir present abundance can be calculated by solving the Boltzmann equation for the\nevolution of the density of particle species (see, e.g., Kolb and Turner 1990).\nAssuming a spherical, uniform top-hat model for the collapse of a cluster (see, e.g.,\nPeebles 1980), the average DM density within a halo which virializes at redshift z is:\n\u0012\n\n\u03c1\u0304 = \u2206(\u03a90 , z)\u03c1b 1 \u2212 fg\n\n\u0013\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the background density is \u03c1b = \u03a9m \u03c1c and \u2206(\u03a90 , z) is the non-linear density contrast\nof the virialized halo (see, e.g., Colafrancesco et al. 1997). Here fg is the gas mass fraction.\nIf we redistribute the total mass, M =\n\n4\u03c0\n\u03c1\u0304Rp3 ,\n3\n\nfound within the radius Rp = prc (expressed\n\nin terms of the cluster core radius rc ), according to a density profile \u03c1(r) = \u03c10 g(r), we find\nthat the central total density is given by:\n\u03c10 =\nwhere I(Rp ) =\n\nR Rp\n0\n\n\u03c1\u0304 Rp3\n,\n3 I(Rp )\n\n(2)\n\ndrr 2 g(r). In our phenomenological approach, we consider two cases: a\n\nconstant core model and a central cusp profile.\nThe constant core model with a density profile:\n\u0014\n\ng(r) = 1 +\n\n\u0012\n\nr\nrc\n\n\u00132 \u0015\u2212\u03be/2\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nassumed here to be given from a beta-profile (Cavaliere and Fusco-Femiano 1976) with\n\u03be = 3\u03b2 and \u03b2 = \u03bcmp v 2 /kT , gives:\n\u03c10 =\nwith p \u2261 Rp /rc and I(p, \u03b2) =\ncore radius rc ).\n\nRp\n0\n\n\u03c1\u0304 p3\n3 I(p, \u03b2)\n\n(4)\n\ndxx2 (1 + x2 )\u22123\u03b2/2 (here x \u2261 r/rc in terms of the cluster\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nThe central cusp model described by a profile:\nr\ng(r) =\nrc\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u2212\u03b7 \u0012\n\nr\n1+\nrc\n\n\u0013\u03b7\u2212\u03be\n\n(5)\n\ngives:\n\u03c1\u0304\np3\n\u03c10 =\n,\n3 I(p, \u03b7, \u03be)\nwhere I(p, \u03b7, \u03be) =\n\nRp\n0\n\n(6)\n\ndxx2\u2212\u03b7 (1 + x)\u03b7\u2212\u03be . With \u03b7 = 1 and \u03be = 3, the central cusp model\n\ncorresponds to the \"universal density profile\" which Navarro, Frenk and White (1997;\nhereafter NFW) showed to be a good description of cluster DM halos in N-body simulations\nof CDM hierarchical clustering. Note that, in both models the DM density scales, at large\nradii, as r \u2212\u03be .\nAssuming that the DM density scales like the total cluster density, a general expression\nfor the central DM number density is:\nn\u03c7,0 =\n\nn\u0304 p3\n3 I\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the integral I is given in eqs. (4) or (6) for the two DM profiles here considered, and\nn\u0304 = 4.21 * 10\n\n\u22125\n\ncm\n\n\u22123\n\nM\u03c7\n\u03a9\u03c7 h\n100 GeV\n2\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\u22121 \u0014\n\n\u2206(\u03a90 , z)\n(1 \u2212 fg ) .\n400\n\u0015\n\n(8)\n\nHere we assume that most of the DM consists of neutralinos of mass M\u03c7 .\nThe annihilation rate of neutralinos in a DM halo is\nR = n\u03c7 (r)h\u03c3V iA ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere n\u03c7 (r) = n\u03c7,0 g(r) is the neutralino number density and h\u03c3V iA is the \u03c7\u03c7 annihilation\ncross section averaged over a thermal velocity distribution at freeze-out temperature.\nAlthough, as anticipated, the \u03c7\u03c7 annihilation cross section is a nontrivial function of the\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nmass and physical composition of the neutralino, to our purpose it suffices to recall that the\n\u03c7relic density is approximately given by (Jungman et al. 1996):\n3 \u00d7 10\u221227 cm3 s\u22121\n.\n\u03a9\u03c7 h \u2243\nh\u03c3V iA\n2\n\n(10)\n\nHence, for the \u03c7\u03c7 annihilation, we will assume a total \u03c7 cross section of\nh\u03c3V iA \u2248 10\u221226 cm3 s\u22121\n\n(11)\n\nto be consistent with the value \u03a9m \u223c 0.3 derived from clusters of galaxies and large scale\nstructure constraints (see, e.g., Bahcall 1999). Detailed studies of the relic neutralino\nannihilation (Edsj\u00f6 1997) show that the above value is well inside the allowed range\npredicted in supersymmetric theories for a wide choice of masses and physical compositions\nof neutralinos that can be relevant as cold DM candidates. Enhancing the \u03c7 annihilation\nrate will have on our results the simple effect of rescaling the final electron spectra by the\nsame enhancement factor\nFor values of h in the range 0.5 <\n\u223ch<\n\u223c 1, we can infer that for a flat, vacuum dominated\nCDM universe with \u03a9\u039b in the range 0.5 \u00f7 0.7 and \u03a9\u03c7 \u223c 0.3 \u00f7 0.5, the quantity \u03a9\u03c7 h2 takes\nvalues in the range \u223c 0.075 \u00f7 0.5, which would fix the annihilation cross section to within a\nfactor less than ten.\n\n3.\n\nProduction and equilibrium electron spectra\n3.1.\n\nThe source spectrum\n\nNeutralinos which annihilate in a DM halo produce quarks, leptons, vector bosons and\nHiggs bosons, depending on their mass and physical composition (see, e.g., Edsj\u00f6 1997).\nFollowing the discussion in Section 1, monochromatic electrons (with energy about M\u03c7 ),\ncoming from the direct channel \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 ee, are in general much suppressed (Turner and\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nWilczek 1990). Electrons are then produced from the decay of the final heavy fermions and\nbosons.\nThe different composition of the \u03c7\u03c7 annihilation final state will in general affect the\nform of the final electron spectrum. To our purpose, it will be sufficient to consider two\nsomewhat extreme cases: 1) a pure-gaugino annihilation, which yields mainly fermion pair\ndirect production \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 f f , with cross sections scaling as Mf2 for different fermions (Turner\nand Wilczek 1990); 2) a mixed gaugino-higgsino state in the case of a dominant annihilation\ninto W (and Z) vector bosons, \u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 W W (ZZ). A real situation will be mostly reproduced\nby either of the above two cases, or by a linear combination of the two.\nThe positron spectrum arising from the \u03c7\u03c7 annihilation has been derived by various\nauthors (Silk and Srednicki 1984, Rudaz and Stecker 1988, Ellis et al. 1989, Stecker and\nTylka 1989, Turner and Wilczek 1990, Kamionkowski and Turner 1991, Baltz and Edsj\u00f6\n1998). Here, we will adopt the approaches by Rudaz and Stecker (1988; hereafter RS) and\nby Kamionkowski and Turner (1991; hereafter KT), that gave the analytical approximations\nof the positron source functions for models in which neutralinos annihilate mainly into\nfermions and vector bosons, respectively. Here we report the results of our calculations\nwhile the details of these two approaches are presented in the Appendix.\nThe total source spectra in the two cases considered are shown in Fig.1 for\nM\u03c7 = 100GeV. The heavy solid curve is the total spectrum for the model in which fermions\ndominate the annihilation. We also show the different contributions to the total source\nspectra from fermions, i.e. the source spectrum for first-generation prompt electrons (P1),\nsecond-generation prompt electrons (P2) and secondary electrons produced in the decay of\ncharged pions (\u03c0). The total source spectrum is rather smooth and, when approximated\nby a single power-law, it has an overall slope Qe \u223c E \u22121.9 in the interesting energy range\n0.02 \u2264 E/M\u03c7 \u2264 0.7.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nThe source spectra for the model in which gauge bosons dominate the annihilation\nis given by the light solid curve. For this case we show the contributions from the decay\nW \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u2192 e\u00b1 ; W \u00b1 \u2192 c \u2192 e\u00b1 (labelled as KT1 ) and from the decays of charged pions\nproduced in hadronic decays of the W \u00b1 (labelled with KT\u03c0 ). Note that we make this\nanalysis restricting only to the W W channel, since the ZZ contribution gives rise to a\nqualitatively similar spectrum.\nTwo prominent spectral features (bumps) around E \u223c M\u03c7 /2 (arising from the direct\ndecay W \u2192 e\u03bd) and E \u223c M\u03c7 /20 are shown by the model in which gauge bosons dominate\nthe annihilation, in comparison with the smoother spectral shape of the fermion dominated\nannihilation. These spectral features are more prominent in Fig.2 where we plot the\nquantity E 3 Qe (E, r). From a closer inspection of Figs.1 and 2, one can see that the\nmain difference between the two models stands in the height and width of the bumps at\nenergies below M\u03c7 /10, where the pion-produced electrons dominate the source spectrum,\nand in the high-energy tail at E <\n\u223c 0.7M\u03c7 where the P1 contribution dominates. In both\nmodels, electrons produced by tertiary decays of gauge bosons are neglected because their\ncontribution is subdominant with respect to the pion decay distribution.\nIn the calculation of the radio halo emission (see Section 4 below) the source spectra of\neq.(A1) and A(18) will be multiplied by a factor 2 to take into account the contribution of\nboth electrons and positrons.\n\n3.2.\n\nThe electron equilibrium spectrum\n\nThe time evolution of the electron spectrum is given by the transport equation:\n\u2202ne (E, r)\n\u2202\nne (E, r)b(E) = Qe (E, r)\n\u2212\n\u2202t\n\u2202E\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(12)\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nwhere ne (E, r) is the equilibrium spectrum at distance r from the cluster center for the\nelectrons with energy E. The source electron spectrum rapidly reaches its equilibrium\nconfiguration mainly due to synchrotron and Inverse Compton Scattering (hereafter ICS)\nlosses at energies E >\n\u223c 150 MeV and to Coulomb losses at smaller energies (Blasi and\nColafrancesco 1999). Since these energy losses are efficient in the ICM and DM annihilation\ncontinuously refills the electron spectrum, the population of high-energy electrons can be\ndescribed by a stationary transport equation (\u2202ne /\u2202t \u2248 0)\n\u2202\n\u2212\nne (E, r)b(E) = Qe (E, r)\n\u2202E\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(13)\n\nfrom which the equilibrium spectrum can be calculated. Here, the function b(E) gives the\nenergy loss per unit time at energy E\nbe (E) =\n\ndE\ndt\n\n!\n\ndE\n+\ndt\nICS\n\n!\n\ndE\n+\ndt\nsyn\n\n!\n\n= b0 (B\u03bc )E 2 + bCoul ,\n\n(14)\n\nCoul\n\nwhere b0 (B\u03bc ) = (2.5 * 10\u221217 + 2.54 * 10\u221218B\u03bc2 ) and bCoul = 7 \u00d7 10\u221216n(r) (if be is given in units\nof GeV/s). In the expression for bCoul , the IC gas density, n(r), is given in units of cm\u22123 .\nThe equilibrium spectrum calculated combining the source spectrum Qe (E, r) and\nthe energy losses b(E) is shown in Fig.3 for the two cases here considered. Equilibrium\nspectra are evaluated separately for the different components of the source spectra and\nthen summed together. This spectrum is evaluated within the cluster core for a constant\ncore density (see eq.2) with a reference value of the central density n\u03c7,0 = 1 cm\u22123 and\nh\u03c3V iA = 10\u221226 cm3 s\u22121 . This equilibrium spectrum can be easily calculated for other cluster\nconfigurations by scaling the parameters of the cluster density profile. The equilibrium\nspectrum for the case in which neutralino annihilation is dominated by fermions, is smooth\nenough that it can be reasonably approximated by a power-law, ne (E) \u223c E \u2212p , down to\nE \u223c M\u03c7 /30 with a slope p \u223c 2.9. We will make use of this convenient approximation in the\ndiscussion of our results.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n3.3.\n\nComparison between approximated and Monte Carlo results\n\nThe source spectra in Fig. 1 arise from an analytic approximation (see the Appendix)\nof the exact shape of the electron spectrum that tries to cope with the details of the quarks\nand leptons decays and of the hadronization of the decay products. Detailed e\u00b1 spectra can\nalso be obtained by using state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations, although the analytical\napproximations used here are able to recover the relevant aspects of more detailed studies.\nThere are, however, some differences among the equilibrium spectra obtained from\ndifferent studies using Monte Carlo techniques. We can compare here our analytical\napproximations with the results of the Monte Carlo simulations run by Baltz and Edsj\u00f6\n(1998), and Golubkov and Koplinoch (1998). Note that the latter study considers massive\nneutrinos annihilation, that, as far as the electron spectra shapes are concerned, should be\nequivalent to the neutralino annihilation at fixed M\u03c7 = m\u03bd , and fixed f f /W W annihilation\ndominance. One can note that for the case we consider here, i.e. M\u03c7 = 100 GeV, the total\nequilibrium electron spectrum from the simulations of Golubkov and Konoplich (1998)\nagrees quite well with the spectrum shown in Fig.3 for the case in which neutralinos\nannihilate mainly into fermions. On the other hand, the case in which the annihilation\nis dominated by vector bosons (KT) is quite well reproduced by the simulations in Baltz\nand Edsj\u00f6 (1998), although there a slightly different value of M\u03c7 (i.e., M\u03c7 \u223c 130 GeV) is\nassumed.\nHowever, beyond the limits of the present discussion, it is worth noticing that there\nare still differences in the electron spectra so far published by different authors using Monte\nCarlo techniques. In view of this, we conservatively assume in our calculations a reasonable\nuncertainty of a factor \u223c 2 in the amplitude of the electron spectrum, and of \u223c 10% in\nits slope. We will consider more detailed predictions derived from available Monte Carlo\nsimulations in a forthcoming paper.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n4.\n\nThe diffuse radio halo emission\n\nThe calculation of the radio emissivity per unit volume is performed here in the\nsimplified assumption that electrons with energy E radiate at a fixed frequency given by :\n\u03bd \u2248 3.7 MHz B\u03bc\n\n\u0012\n\nE\nGeV\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nThis approximation introduces negligible errors in the final result and has the advantage of\nmaking it of immediate physical interpretation.\nThe radio emissivity at frequency \u03bd and at distance r from the cluster center can be\ncalculated as\ndE\nj(\u03bd, r) = ne (E, r)\ndt\n\n!\n\nsyn\n\ndE\n,\nd\u03bd\n\n(16)\n\nwhere (dE/dt)syn is given in eq.(14). The radio halo luminosity is obtained by integration\nof j(\u03bd, r) over the cluster volume yielding:\nJ(\u03bd) = 4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nRhalo\n0\n\ndr r 2 j(\u03bd, r) ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere Rhalo is the size of the cluster radio halo. The observed radio halo flux is then\nF (\u03bd) =\n\nJ(\u03bd)\n4\u03c0DL2\n\nwhere DL (z, \u03a90 ) is the cluster luminosity distance (see, e.g., Weinberg 1972). For the sake\nof illustration, we give the explicit form of J(\u03bd) in the case of a power-law source spectrum,\nQ(E, r) = Q0 (E/E0 )\u2212s , where Q0 = n2\u03c7 (r)h\u03c3V iA (kM\u03c7 )\u22121 and E0 is a normalization energy,\nsay 1 GeV. Using eqs. (13), (16) and (17), we can write\n4\u03c0n2\u03c7,0 h\u03c3V iA (kM\u03c7 )\u22121 \u0012 E\u2217 \u0013\u2212s+2\nb0,syn (B\u03bc ) \u03b1r \u22121 \u2212\u03b1r\nJ(\u03bd) =\nB\u03bc \u03bd\nE0 I\n2(s \u2212 1)\nE0\nb0 (B\u03bc )\nwhere \u03b1r = s/2, E\u2217 = 16.44 GeV, I =\n\nR Rhalo\n0\n\n(18)\n\ndrr 2 g 2(r), b0 (B\u03bc ) = (2.5 * 10\u221217 + 2.54 * 10\u221218B\u03bc2\n\nand b0,syn (B\u03bc ) = 2.54 * 10\u221218 B\u03bc2 . For B\u03bc <\n\u223c 3.14, the radio luminosity scales in eq.(18) as\nJ(\u03bd) \u221d n2\u03c7,0 h\u03c3V iA (kM\u03c7 )\u22121 B\u03bc\u03b1r +1 \u03bd \u2212\u03b1r .\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nIn the calculation of the radio halo luminosity we consider both the case of a uniform\nIC magnetic field and a case in which the magnetic field has a radial profile which declines\nwith the distance from the cluster center, as indicated by recent numerical simulations (see,\ne.g., Friaca and Goncalves 1998). Specifically, we considered a magnetic field density profile\n\u0014\n\nB = B0 1 +\n\n\u0012\n\nr\nrc,B\n\n\u00132 \u0015\u2212w/2\n\n(19)\n\nwith values w \u223c 0.5 \u00f7 1. Here, for simplicity, we assume that the spatial structure of the\nmagnetic field is given by a constant core profile with lenght scale rc,B .\n\n4.1.\n\nThe radio halo spectrum and spatial distribution\n\nThe total radio halo flux predicted from our model has generally a steep spectrum\nwith average slope \u03b1r \u223c 1.2 \u2212 1.8, depending on the neutralino mass and composition\nand on the shape of the DM density and magnetic field profiles. We will discuss more\nspecifically this point in Section 5 below. Here we want to emphasize that for a fixed value\nof the magnetic field B, the neutralino mass fixes the maximum frequency at which we can\nobserve synchrotron emission from the radio halo,\n\u03bdmax \u223c 3.7 MHz B\u03bc\n\n\u0012\n\nkM\u03c7\nGeV\n\n\u00132\n\n(20)\n\nFor M\u03c7 = 100 GeV and k \u2248 0.7 (see Appendix), the maximum frequency at which the\nradio halo spectrum is observable is \u03bdmax \u2248 18.1 GHz \u00d7B\u03bc . From this fact, we can use the\navailable data on the radio halos of Coma and 1E0657-56 (see Figures 3 and 4) to set a\nlower limit to the neutralino mass. Specifically, the maximum frequency, \u03bdmax,obs , at which\nthe radio halo spectrum is observed sets a lower limit\n16.44\nGeV\nM\u03c7 \u2265\nk\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bdmax,obs\nGHz\n\n\u00131/2\n\nB\u03bc\u22121/2\n\n(21)\n\nwhich gives M\u03c7 \u2265 74.3 GeV B\u03bc\u22121/2 , for \u03bdmax,obs = 10 GHz. Furthermore, the present\ntheory predicts a sharp cutoff in the radio halo spectrum at \u03bdmax given by eq.(20); so,\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nhigh frequency observations can both test the neutralino model and measure the quantity\nB\u03bc (kM\u03c7 )2 from the possible detection of the high-\u03bd sharp cutoff in the radio halo spectrum.\nThe brightness profile of the radio halo is obtained by integration of the emissivity,\nj(\u03bd, r), along the line of sight. It scales, for a power-law radio halo spectrum, as\nSradio \u221d\n\nZ\n\ndl n2 (r) * B 1+\u03b1r (r)\n\n(22)\n\nand declines at large radii as r \u2212[\u03be+w(1+\u03b1r )]+1/2 . The radio halo brightness profile resembles,\nfor both the DM profiles here considered, the X-ray brightness profile of the cluster which\nscales as\nSX\u2212ray \u221d\n\nZ\n\ndl n2 (r) * T 1/2 (r) .\n\n(23)\n\nIn particular, for a uniform magnetic field, B = const, and for a isothermal cluster, T =\nconst., the brightness Sradio behaves exactly as the X-ray brightness SX\u2212ray at all radii.\nSmall deviations from this behaviour can be attributed to radial variations in B(r) and/or\nin T (r).\nThe radio halo brightness profile depends on the assumed DM profile (see eqs.19 and\n22). Specifically, at small radii the constant core model still gives a radio brightness profile\nthat resembles the X-ray emission profile while the central cusp model tends to give a radio\nbrightness which is more peaked toward the center. Thus, the model predicts a strong radio\nemissivity at the cluster center under the assumption of a central cusp (or NFW) profile.\nHowever, neutralino annihilation can also cause a softening of the central DM cusp due to\nthe high interaction rate of neutralinos in the central region of the clusters with respect to\nthe outer parts (see Kaplinghat, Knox and Turner 2000). This countereffect weakens the\naforementioned problem.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n4.2.\n\nInverse Compton Scattering emission\n\nThe relativistic electrons which are responsible for the radio halo emission also\nemit X-rays and UV photons through Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) off the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background photons. As in the case of the synchrotron emission, also for ICS\nwe can adopt the approximation that electrons radiate at a single energy, given by\nEX = 2.7 keV E 2 (GeV ).\n\n(24)\n\nElectrons with energy in excess of a few GeV radiate in the hard X-ray range, while\nelectrons with energy smaller than \u223c 400 MeV produce soft X-rays and UV photons.

Moreover, these data in turn can set interesting\nconstraints to the mass and composition of the neutralino.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nFor any cluster, we choose a DM central density, n\u03c7,0 , which is given by eq. (7)\nevaluated with the parameters appropriate to each cluster and, in the case of 1E0657-56,\nwith parameters approriate to each reagion in which the radio halo spectrum has been\nobserved.\nIn the case of Coma we choose the following parameters: rc = 0.4h\u22121\n50 Mpc,\n\u03b2 = 0.76, n\u03c7,0 = 3 * 10\u22123 cm\u22123 . The radio halo spectrum has been integrated out to a\nradius Rhalo = 1.3h\u22121\n50 Mpc (see, e.g., Giovannini et al. 1993). In the model in which\nneutralino annihilation is dominated by fermions (\u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 f f ), a uniform magnetic field\nBunif orm \u2248 1.3 \u03bcG is needed to fit the spectrum under the assumption of a constant core\nprofile. In the case of a declining magnetic field B = B0 [1 + (r/rc,B )2 ]\u22120.7 , a value B0 = 8 \u03bcG\nfits better the data, under the same model assumptions. The resulting spectra are shown\nin Fig.4. In this figure we also show the spectra derived from the power-law approximation\nof the equilibrium spectrum shown in Fig.3. A radially decreasing magnetic field yields a\nslightly steeper spectral slope, as it should be expected from eq.(17).\nUnder the same assumptions of a constant core profile and radially decreasing\nmagnetic field, the model in which neutralino annihilation is dominated by gauge bosons\n(\u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 W W ) does not fit the Coma radio halo (see Fig.4). Within the limits of the\nanalytical approximations used in this paper, the Coma data exclude this model at more\nthan 3 standard deviations (see Fig.5). In this figure we also show the range of uncertainties\nin the final radio halo spectra calculated considering an uncertainty of a factor \u00b12 in the\noverall normalization of the source spectra and \u00b110% uncertainty on their slopes, for the\ntwo extreme annihilation model here considered.\nIn the case of the distant cluster 1E0657-56 at z = 0.269, we choose different parameters\naccording to the two different regions in which the spectrum has beem measured (we use\nthe core radii and \u03b2 parameters given in Liang et al. 2000). We assume that neutralino\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nannihilation is dominated by fermions (\u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 f f ) and consider a constant core DM density\n\u22123\nprofile. For the outer region we choose rc = 0.38h\u22121\ncm\u22123 .\n50 Mpc, \u03b2 = 0.7, n\u03c7,0 = 9 * 10\n\nThe radio halo spectrum has been integrated out to a radius Rhalo = 2h\u22121\n50 Mpc (Liang et al.\n2000). A uniform magnetic field Bunif orm \u2248 2. \u03bcG is needed to fit the spectrum of the outer\nregion. In the case of a declining magnetic field B = B0 [1 + (r/rc,B )2 ]\u22120.5 , a value B0 = 100\n\u03bcG can fit the data. For the inner region we choose rc = 0.08h\u22121\n50 Mpc, \u03b2 = 0.49 and the\nsame central density n\u03c7,0 = 9 * 10\u22123 cm\u22123 . The radio halo spectrum has been integrated out\nto a radius Rhalo = 0.6h\u22121\n50 Mpc. A uniform magnetic field B \u2248 9 \u03bcG is needed to fit the\nspectrum of this region. In the case of a declining magnetic field B = B0 [1 + (r/rc,B )2 ]\u22120.5 ,\na value B0 = 100 \u03bcG fits the data. The results are shown in Fig.7. As in the case of Coma,\nthe extreme case of neutralino annihilation dominated by gauge bosons (\u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 W W ) is\ninconsistent with the radio halo spectrum of this cluster.\nNote that the radio-halo spectra shown in Figures 4-7 are calculated assuming a\nconstant core density profile for the DM component. A central cusp model gives a higher\ncentral density and increases the \u03c7 annihilation rate in the central region of the cluster\nwhich in turn produces more high-energy electrons per unit volume. This increase in the\nelectron density must be compensated by a decrease in the magnetic field value needed to\nfit the radio halo spectrum. In fact, assuming a NFW density profile for Coma, a uniform\nmagnetic field Bunif orm = 0.45\u03bcG is required to fit the data. Alternatively, a central value\nof the magnetic field, B0 = 1.4\u03bcG is able to fit the spectrum assuming a B radial profile\nas given by eq. (19). We show the difference between the spectra obtained either with a\nbeta-profile or with a NFW profile in Figure 8.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n6.\n\nThe J1.4 \u2212 T relation for radio-halo clusters\n\nAnother interesting property of radio halo clusters is the steep correlation existing\nbetween the monochromatic radio halo luminosity observed at 1.4 GHz, J1.4 , and the IC gas\ntemperature: J1.4 \u223c T q with q = 6.25 (range q = 4.1 \u00f7 12.5 at 90% confidence level) found\nby Colafrancesco (1999, 2000) and confirmed by Liang et al. (2000). Radio luminosity\ndata are taken from Feretti (1999), Giovannini et al. (1999), Liang et al. (1999) and Owen\net al. (1999). Here, we use the temperature data from Arnaud and Evrard (1999), bur a\nsimilar result obtains using temperature data from Wu, Xue and Fang (1999) or David et\nal. (1993). Such a steep correlation (see Fig.9) can be reproduced in models of radio halos\npowered by acceleration of cosmic rays triggered either by strong merging events or by\nenhanced galaxy activity, but requires specific conditions for the structure of the magnetic\nfield (see Colafrancesco 1999, 2000 for a discussion).\nIn the model we present here the radio halo luminosity (see eqs.17-18) scales as\nJ(\u03bd) \u221d n2\u03c7,0 rc3 h\u03c3V iA B 1+\u03b1r \u03bd \u2212\u03b1r\n\n(27)\n\nwhere \u03b1r = dlnJ(\u03bd)/dln\u03bd is the effective slope of the radio halo spectrum. Thus,\nthe monochromatic radio halo luminosity correlates naturally with the cluster X-ray\nbremsstrahlung luminosity, LX \u221d n20 fg2 rc3 T 1/2 (here n0 is the central IC gas density and\nfg = Mgas /M is the cluster baryon fraction), to give\nJ1.4 \u221d LX fg\u22122 T \u22121/2 h\u03c3V iA B 1+\u03b1r .\n\n(28)\n\nUsing the observed correlation, LX \u223c T b with b \u223c 3 (see, e.g., Arnaud and Evrard 1999,\nWu et al. 1999, David et al. 1993) and assuming that fg = const, as indicated by the\navailable cluster data (Jones and Forman 1999, Mohr 2000), we derive\nJ1.4 \u223c T (4b\u22121)/2 h\u03c3V iA B 1+\u03b1r\n\n(29)\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nUnder the condition \u2013 assumed in this paper \u2013 of hydrostatic equilibrium of the cluster\nmaterial with the overall potential wells, the relation V \u223c T 1/2 holds, and we finally obtain:\nJ1.4 \u223c T b B 1+\u03b1r .\n\n(30)\n\nIf every cluster has the same value of the magnetic field (universality condition), a\ncorrelation J1.4 \u223c T 3 obtains. This is too flat compared to the observed correlation.\nHowever, the universality condition B = const is rather unlikely. In fact, we expect that B\nincreases with increasing T either under the condition of energy equipartition between the\nIC gas and the magnetic field (which yields B \u223c T 1/2 ) or even under the condition of a B\nfield which is frozen-in the ICM (i.e., B \u223c n\u03b3 with \u03b3 \u223c 2/3, which yields B \u223c T (b\u22122)\u03b3 ).\nIn conclusion, it is reasonable to expect a quite steep correlation, J1.4 \u223c T 4.15\u00b10.25\nor J1.4 \u223c T 4.40\u00b10.26 , for an equipartition or frozen-in magnetic field. Such a correlation is\nconsistent (within the uncertainties) with the best fit result given above and can reproduce\nthe overall distribution of clusters in the J1.4 \u2212T plane. Moreover, since T \u221d (1+z)\u22061/3 (\u03a90 , z)\nin CDM models of structure formation (see, e.g., Colafrancesco et al. 1997), the radio halo\npower is expected to evolve strongly with redshift J1.4 \u223c [(1 + z)\u22061/3 (\u03a90 , z)]q . Thus, already\nat z \u223c 0.2 its normalization increases by a factor \u223c 2 (we use here q = 4 as a reference\nvalue). The J1.4 \u2212 T correlation predicted in the present model at z = 0 and at z = 0.25 is\nshown in Fig.9. The large steepness q \u2248 6.25 deduced by a formal power-law fit to the data\ncan be due to a superposition of the different correlations of radio halo clusters observed in\nthe range z \u2248 0 \u00f7 0.3.\n\n7.\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\nIn this paper we have shown that the basic properties (i.e., the spectrum, the\nsurface brightness profile and the J1.4 \u2212 T correlation) of radio halos in galaxy clusters\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\ncan be reasonably fitted by a model in which the high-energy electrons, giving rise to\nthe synchrotron emission, arise from the decay of secondary products of the neutralino\nannihilation in the DM halos of galaxy clusters. The slope and the frequency extension\nof the spectrum can set interesting constraints on the neutralino mass and composition.\nIn fact, the highest observed frequency of the radio halo spectrum set a lower limit to the\nneutralino mass:\nM\u03c7 \u2265 16.44 GeV k \u22121\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\n\u03bdmax,obs 1\nGHz B\u03bc\n\u0013\n\n\u00151/2\n\n.\n\nIn particular, the highest frequency (\u03bd \u223c 4.85 GHz) at which the Coma spectrum has been\nobserved requires M\u03c7 \u2265 54.6 GeV B\u03bc\u22121/2 . A more stringent limit, M\u03c7 \u2265 70.5 GeV B\u03bc\u22121/2 ,\nis obtained from the cluster 1E0657-56. Radio halo observations at frequencies larger\nthan 5 \u00f7 10 GHz are not yet available, but are important to test the present model. In\nfact, the detection of a high frequency cutoff, \u03bdcut , in the radio halo spectra gives an\nupper limit on the neutralino mass. The high-\u03bd cutoff predicted in our model, has the\nsame value, \u03bdcut = 3.7 MHzB\u03bc [k(M\u03c7 /GeV )]2 , for all radio halos and depends only on the\nneutralino mass and the IC magnetic field. For a fixed neutralino mass and composition,\nthe observations of this high-\u03bd cutoff can yield a direct estimate of the cluster magnetic\nfield.\nIn the same framework, the slope of the radio halo spectrum gives an indication on the\nneutralino physical composition. The radio halo spectrum of the two clusters considered\nhere are well fitted by a model in which the neutralinos behave like pure gauginos, and\nannihilate mainly into fermions. On the other hand, when the neutralino annihilation is\ndominated by vector bosons (implying a non-negligible higgsino component), the electron\nsource spectrum is too steep and shows two unobserved bumps at low and high energies\n(see Figs.1 and 2). This feature is also evident in the final radio halo spectrum (see Fig.5).\nIndeed, Figs. 5 and 6 show how far the neutralino model dominated by vector bosons is\nfrom reproducing the data of the radio halo spectrum of Coma and 1E0657-56.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nAfter setting the neutralino mass and composition, the slope of the radio halo spectrum\nstill depends on the DM density profile and on the magnetic-field radial profile, that\ninfluence the annihilation rate and the synchrotron emission power, respectively. The\navailable data on Coma indicate (in the case of a constant core density profile) that a\nradially decreasing magnetic field is favoured to fit the correct steepness of the spectrum\nat high frequencies. This constraint is tighter for Coma, where an upper limit of 52 mJy\nat \u03bd = 4.85 GHz has been measured (see, e.g., Deiss et al. 1997), than for 1E0657-56,\nwhere a rather constant slope is observed up to \u03bd \u223c 10 GHz. For a constant core density\nprofile, the spectra of Coma and 1E0657-56 are consistent either with uniform IC magnetic\nfields Bunif orm \u223c 1.3 \u00f7 2 \u03bcG or central values B0 \u223c 8 \u00f7 100 \u03bcG for a magnetic field profile\nB(r) \u223c r \u22121 at large distances from the cluster center. Using a central cusp (NFW) density\nprofile increases slightly the slopes of the radio halo spectrum, reducing consequently the\nneed for a magnetic field strongly decreasing with the distance from the cluster center. The\ncentral cusp profile requires also IC magnetic field amplitudes lower by a factor \u223c 3 \u00f7 5 to\nfit the radio halo spectrum.\nThe present model also predicts a mild steepening of the radio halo spectrum with\nincreasing distance from the cluster center. This effect is mainly due both to the lower\nDM densities (which decrease the neutralino annihilation rate) and to a decrease of the\nIC magnetic field (which reduces the emitted powers via synchrotron emission) at large\ndistances from the cluster center. The model presented here can fit reasonably well the\nradio halo spectra of the cluster 1E0657-56 in the inner and outer regions at which it has\nbeen measured by Liang et al. (2000). It also gives values for the radio spectral index of\nComa \u03b1r \u223c 0.9 \u00f7 1.6, from the cluster center out to \u223c 1 Mpc. These values are consistent\n(within the given uncertainties) with the increase of the radio spectral index of Coma given\nby Giovannini et al. (1993).\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nIt is also noticeable that the spatial extension of the radio halo emission which is\npredicted in the present model is very similar to that of the X-ray emission from the IC gas,\na property which has been emphasized in several observational works (see, e.g., Feretti 1999,\nLiang et al. 2000). Changes of radio halo/X-ray surface brightness ratio, Sradio /SX\u2212ray ,\nwith radius can be accounted for by radial variations of the IC magnetic field and/or the\nIC gas temperature.\nThe analysis presented in this paper is made for a value of the neutralino annihilation\ncross-sections h\u03c3V iA \u2248 10\u221226 cm3 s\u22121 . This value is well inside the allowed range for a\nneutralino relevant as a DM candidate, and can be rescaled in a straightforward way from\nour results, for different assumptions on h\u03c3V iA . Because the radio halo spectrum power\n(see eqs.17-18) scales linearly with h\u03c3V iA n2\u03c7 B 1+\u03b1r (here \u03b1r = dlnF (\u03bd)/dln\u03bd is the effective\nspectral slope), higher (lower) values of the annihilation cross section imply lower (higher)\nDM densities, and require a lower (higher) IC magnetic field.\nAnother interesting aspect of the present model for the origin of cluster radio halos\nis that it can reproduce fairly well the observed correlation between the monochromatic\nradio halo power, J1.4 , and the IC gas temperature T . The steep J1.4 \u2212 T relation shown\nby the available radio-halo clusters can be reproduced in our model as a superposition of\nevolutionary effects of the correlation J1.4 \u223c T q , with q \u223c 4.2 \u00f7 4.4, which results from\nthe dependence of the electron spectrum, ne (E, r) \u221d n2\u03c7 (r)h\u03c3V iA , from the DM density,\nn\u03c7 (r), and annihilation cross-section, h\u03c3V iA , with the further assumption of an energy\nequipartition between the IC gas and the IC magnetic field.\nThe ICS emission from the same population of relativistic electrons produces\nunavoidably also fluxes of UV and X-ray emission that, however, are not so intense to\nreproduce the emission excesses in the EUV (Lieu et al. 1996) and in the hard X-rays\n(Fusco-Femiano et al. 1999, Rephaeli, Gruber and Blanco 1999) observed in Coma.\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nThis fact should be not considered as a problem for the model we have worked out here\nsince other alternative explanations have been proposed to fit the EUV and hard X-ray\nemission excesses in the framework of thermal (see Antonuccio-Delogu et al. 2000) and/or\nsuprathermal phenomena (Ensslin et al. 1999-2000, Dogiel 1999, Sarazin and Kempner\n1999, Blasi et al. 2000), respectively .\nAnother remarkable feature of the present model, is that neutralino annihilation can\nalso give rise to gamma rays with continuum fluxes which are overwhelmingly due to\n\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 + \u03b3 decays. The continuum gamma-ray spectrum is given by:\nf\u03b3 (E\u03b3 ) = 2\n\nZ\n\nM\u03c7\n\nEl (E\u03b3 )\n\ndE\u03c0 (E\u03c02 \u2212 m2\u03c0 )\u22121/2 \u03b6\u03c0 f (E\u03c0 )\n\n(31)\n\n(see,e.g., Rudaz and Stecker 1988) where the quantity \u03b6\u03c0 f (E\u03c0 ) is derived in equation (A12)\nof the Appendix. We recall here that E\u03c0 is the pion energy, El = E\u03b3 + m2\u03c0 /4E\u03b3 and E\u03b3 is\nthe energy of the gamma-ray photon. The resulting gamma-ray luminosity is\nL\u03b3 =\n\n4\u03c0n2\u03c7,0 h\u03c3V iA\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nR\n\ndrr 2g 2 (r)f\u03b3 (E\u03b3 )\n\n(32)\n\nand yields, for Coma, a gamma-ray flux F\u03b3 (> 100MeV ) = 3 * 10\u22129 cm\u22122 s\u22121 (for\nM\u03c7 = 100 GeV; see Fig.10), which stays below the EGRET upper limit for Coma,\nF\u03b3Coma (> 100MeV ) = 4 * 10\u22128 cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Sreekumar et al. 1996).\n(2b\u22121)/2b\n\nNote that a correlation L\u03b3 \u221d LX\n\n(here b is the exponent of the X-ray luminosity\n\n\u2013 temperature correlation, LX \u223c T b ) is expected in this model with fg = const, at variance\n1/4\n\nwith the correlation L\u03b3 \u223c LX expected in models of cosmic ray (pp) interaction in the\nICM, (Colafrancesco and Blasi 1998). The different slope of the L\u03b3 \u2212 LX relation will\nprovide a way to disentangle between these two mechanisms for the production of gamma\nrays in galaxy clusters.\nThe gamma ray emission produced by \u03c7\u03c7 interaction extends up to energies\ncorresponding to the neutralino mass (see Fig.11). One way to disentangle a particular\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nmodel for the cluster gamma-ray emission is provided by the future high-energy gamma-ray\nexperiments. They will allow to observe galaxy clusters with a photon statistics sufficient to\ndisentangle the gamma-ray spectra produced by the \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3 + \u03b3 electromagnetic decay, as\npredicted either in DM annihilation models (\u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 f f, W W \u2192 \u03c0 0 ) or in secondary electron\nmodels (pp \u2192 \u03c0 0 ; see, e.g., Colafrancesco and Blasi 1998), from the gamma-ray emission\nproduced by the bremsstrahlung of primary cosmic ray electrons. These observational\ncapabilities will be available, however, in the next future. We will discuss more specifically\nthis issue in a forthcoming paper.\nFinally, we want to discuss a number of additional stringent predictions through which\nthe model discussed here can be tested.\n(i) According to the fact that DM is present in all large scale structures, we should observe\nradio halos in every cluster, which is not actually observed. In the framework of this paper,\nwe have shown that radio halos can be fitted with sensitively high magnetic fields (with\ncentral values B0 \u223c 5 \u00f7 100 \u03bcG). Then, only clusters which have such high magnetic fields\ncan show a bright radio halo. All the other clusters are expected to have faint radio halos\nthat can brighten up when there is some effect that raises the magnetic field amplitude, for\nexample, a merging event (see the numerical simulations of K. Roettiger. 1999).\n(ii) A possible problem could be given by the fact that cooling flow clusters, which have\nusually high magnetic field in their central cooling regions, do not show strong evidence\nfor extended radio halos. However, if one assumes that the magnetic field in cooling flow\nclusters is quite peaked near the cluster center and decreases rapidly towards the outskirts,\nthe radio halo emission predicted in the present model is a factor \u223c 102 \u00f7 106 lower than\nthat of a non-cooling flow cluster with the same mass [these estimates are obtained for\na Coma-like cluster using the magnetic field profile given in eq.(19) with parameters,\nrc,B = 0.1h\u22121\n50 Mpc and w = 0.5 \u00f7 2]. Nonetheless, it remains true that our model does\npredict that cooling flow cluster should possess small-size, low-luminosity and low-surface\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\nbrightness radio halos.\n(iii) Under the assumption that all clusters show a universal DM profile, the radio halo\nspectrum is basically the same unless the magnetic field configuration of the cluster is very\npeculiar. For example, steep radio halo spectra can be obtained mainly due to the presence\nof magnetic fields that decrease strongly from the cluster center.\nLittle is known about the presence and structure of the IC magnetic fields. Faraday rotation\nmeasurements (Vallee et al. 1986, 1987) give a lower estimate of the magnetic field in small\nscale regions of the cluster (Dolag et al. 1999), and we could have to deal with large scale IC\nmagnetic fields that are lower than those (B0 \u223c 5 \u00f7 100 \u03bcG, Bunif orm \u223c 1 \u00f7 3 \u03bcG) required\nby the present model to explain radio halos. However, even though the magnetic field are\nnot so strong in clusters, the present model certainly yields a natural explanation for the\norigin of the seed high-energy electrons, which are a necessary input for any model of radio\nhalo (and relic) formation. The diffuse radio emission due to such a population of seed\nelectrons could then be boosted by the amplification of the IC magnetic field subsequent to\na strong cluster merger (Roettiger 1999), or the seed electrons could be reaccelerated by\nintracluster turbulence (Deiss et al. 1997, Eilek and Weatherall 1999, Brunetti et al. 1999).\nWhile at the moment, we observe radio halos in more than 20 clusters at different\nredshifts, the definite test for the theory of the radio halo origin proposed here is committed\nto obtain a larger, unbiased survey of galaxy clusters through high radio sensitivity\nobservations. This search should be complemented with the search for gamma-ray emission\nfrom galaxy clusters whose predicted intensity is matched by the sensitivities of the\nnext generation gamma-ray experiments (GLAST, AGILE, MAGIC, VERITAS, ARGO,\nSTACEE).\nIn conclusion, we want to emphasize that the astrophysical expectations from the \u03c7\u03c7\nannihilation are consistent, at the moment, with the constraints set by all the available\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\nobservations on clusters containing radio halos. The astrophysical and fundamental physics\nrequirements on the model discussed here are stringent, but still well allowed. It is also\nappealing, in these respects, to expect that some astrophysical features of galaxy clusters\nmight give information on the fundamental properties of the DM particles.\n\nAknowledgments.

The production spectrum of high-energy electrons\n\nIn this Appendix we will derive an analytical approximation for the source spectrum of\nelectrons resulting from the decay products of \u03c7\u03c7 annihilation. Here we will refer mainly to\nthe analytical approaches of Rudaz and Stecker (1988; hereafter RS) and of Kamionkowski\nand Turner (1991; hereafter KT) who gave analytical approximations of the positron source\nfunctions for models in which neutralinos annihilate mainly into fermions (\u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 f f ) or\ngauge bosons (\u03c7\u03c7 \u2192 W W ) , respectively. In the following, we derive the electron source\nspectra for generic values of the neutralino number density, n\u03c7 (r), and annihilation cross\nsection, h\u03c3V iA .\n\nA.1.\n\nFermion dominated annihilation\n\nFollowing RS, we consider three main sources of e\u00b1 from \u03c7\u03c7 annihilation: (P1) first\ngeneration, prompt electrons with a continuum spectrum; (P2) second generation, prompt\nelectrons; (\u03c0) electrons produced from the decay of \u03c0 \u00b1 . The electron source spectrum,\nQ(E, r), can be written as the sum of these three components\nQf f (E, r) = QP 1 (E, r) + QP 2 (E, r) + Q\u03c0 (E, r) .\n\n(A1)\n\nFor a neutralino with mass M\u03c7 = 100 GeV, the first generation source spectrum takes\ncontributions mainly from b \u2192 e, c \u2192 e, \u03c4 \u00b1 \u2192 e\u00b1 (see RS). Taking into account the different\nenergy distributions of the previous decays, the first generation electron spectrum is found\nto be well approximated by\nQP 1 (E, r) = n2\u03c7 h\u03c3V iA \u03b61 f1 (E)\n\n(A2)\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\nwith \u03b61 \u2248 0.6/(kM\u03c7 ) and k \u2248 0.7.\nThe function f1 (E) is given by\nf1 (x) =\n\n3\n27\n0.17\nf\u03c4 (x) + 0.13 \u00d7 fc (x) + 0.1 \u00d7 fb (x)\n31\n31\n31\n\n(A3)\n\nwhere\nf\u03c4 (x) = fb (x) =\n\n5 4 3\n+ x \u2212 3x2\n3 3\n\n(A4)\n\nand\n\u0012\n\n3\n\n2\n\nfc (x) = 2 1 + 2x \u2212 3x\n\n\u0013\n\n(A5)\n\nin terms of the adimensional quantity x = E/M\u03c7 . In eq.(A3) we replace the values assumed\nby RS for the leptonic decay branching ratios with the present values taken from the\nParticle Data Group (Groom et al. 2000). Neglecting the differences between f\u03c4 , fb and fc ,\nthe source function QP 1 \u2013 as noticed by RS \u2013 can be approximated by\nQP 1 (E, r) \u2248 0.11n2\u03c7 h\u03c3V iA * f (E)\n\n(A6)\n\nwhere\nf (E) =\n\n1\n\u03b8(kM\u03c7 \u2212 E)\nkM\u03c7\n\n(A7)\n\nwhere the function \u03b8(kM\u03c7 \u2212 E) is the Heaviside function. The source function QP 1 (E, r) is\nbasically constant up to E \u2248 kM\u03c7 and then drops to zero for higher energies (see Fig.1).\n\nThe second generation source spectrum (arising from the leptonic decays in the final states\nof the first generation decays) is found to be well approximated by:\nQP 2 (E, r) = n2\u03c7 h\u03c3V iA \u03b62 f2 (E)\n\n(A8)\n\nk 2 M\u03c7\n1\nln\nf2 (E) = 2\nk M\u03c7\nE\n\n(A9)\n\nwith\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\nwhere, again, k \u2248 0.7 and\n\u03b62 \u2248\n\n0.17\n3\n27\n+ 0.13 \u00d7\n+ 0.1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7\n.\n31\n31\n31\n\n(A10)\n\nThis source function goes rapidly to zero for E \u2192 k 2 M\u03c7 \u2248 M\u03c7 /2 (see Fig.1). Again, in\neq.(A10) we replace the values assumed by RS for the leptonic decay branching ratios with\nthe present values taken from the Particle Data Group (Groom et al. 2000).\n\nFollowing RS, we find that the source spectrum from \u03c0 \u00b1 decay is found to be well\napproximated by:\nQ\u03c0 (E, r) = n2\u03c7 h\u03c3V iA \u03b6\u03c0 f\u03c0 (E)\n\n(A11)\n\nf\u03c0 (E) = e\u22120.68E + 0.115e\u22120.276E\n\n(A12)\n\nwith\n\nand \u03b6\u03c0 \u2248 1.74(100 GeV/M\u03c7 ).\nThe three source functions for P1, P2 and \u03c0 contributions together with the total source\nfunction are plotted in Figs.1 and 2.\n\nA.2.\n\nGauge boson dominated annihilation\n\nIn addition to the electron produced by the direct decays of vector bosons (typical\nenergy of \u223c M\u03c7 /2) there is a continuum spectrum of electrons at E <\n\u223c M\u03c7 /2 which are\nproduced as secondary decay products (W \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u2192 e\u00b1 , W \u00b1 \u2192 c \u2192 e\u00b1 ) and from the\ndecays of charged pions produced in hadronic decays of the W \u00b1 and Z 0 bosons. Since the\nelectron distributions arising from the W and the Z bosons are qualitatively similar, we\nwill restrict our analysis to the W case. Following KT, the source distribution function of\nsecondary-decay electrons, integrated over the quark and lepton energies, is\nQW,\u03bc,\u03c4,c (E, r) = n2\u03c7 h\u03c3V iA \u03b6W,\u03bc,\u03c4,c fW,\u03bc,\u03c4,c(E)\n\n(A13)\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\nwhere\n\u03b6W,\u03bc,\u03c4,c = BW \u2192\u03bc + 0.17BW \u2192\u03c4 + 0.13BW \u2192c\n\n(A14)\n\nand\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nfW,\u03bc,\u03c4,c(E) = \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\u0014\n\n1\nln (1+\u03b4)\nkM\u03c7 \u03b4\n(1\u2212\u03b4)\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(1+\u03b4)\n1\nln kM\u03c72E\nkM\u03c7 \u03b4\n\n0\n\nfor E \u2264\n\u0015\n\nfor\n\nkM\u03c7\n(1\n2\n\nkM\u03c7\n(1\n2\n\nfor E \u2265\n\n+ \u03b4),\n\n+ \u03b4) \u2264 E \u2264\n\nkM\u03c7\n(1\n2\n\nkM\u03c7\n(1\n2\n\n+ \u03b4),\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\n+ \u03b4), \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\n(A15)\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\nIn this expression, \u03b4 = [1 \u2212 (MW /M\u03c7 )2 ]1/2 with MW = 80 GeV being the W boson mass.\nAdopting values BW \u2192\u03bc = 0.11, BW \u2192\u03c4 = 0.11 and BW \u2192c = 0.34 for the previous branching\nratios, we obtain \u03b6W,\u03bc,\u03c4,c \u2248 0.1729.\nThe hadronization of quarks from gauge boson decays results in a shower of charged\npions which eventually decay into electrons (\u03c0 \u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc\u00b1 \u2192 e\u00b1 ). Following KT, the source\nfunction for the pion-produced electrons, integrated over the quark energy distribution,\nwrites\nQW,\u03c0 (E, r) = n2\u03c7 h\u03c3V iA \u03b6W,\u03c0 fW,\u03c0 (E)\n\n(A16)\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 Z Emax\n\u221268E/E \u2032\n\u221227.6E/E \u2032\n\u2032\nfW,\u03c0 (E) =\n+ 56e\ndE 93e\nM\u03c7 \u03b4 Emin\n\n(A17)\n\nwhere \u03b6W,\u03c0 \u2248 2/3 and\n\nwhere Emin = M\u03c7 (1 \u2212 \u03b4)/2 and Emax = M\u03c7 (1 + \u03b4)/2. The total source function for this\ncase writes\nQW W (E, r) = QW,\u03bc,\u03c4,c (E, r) + QW,\u03c0 (E, r)\nand is compared to the source function Qf f (E, r) in Figs.1 and 2.\n\n(A18)\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nAntonuccio-Delogu et al. 2000, in Proceedings of the Moriond Meeting Energy Densities in\nthe Universe, Tran-Tan van et al Eds., in press\nArnaud, M. and Evrard, A.E. 1999, MNRAS, 305, 631\nBahcall, N. 1999, preprint astro-ph/9901076\nBaltz, E.A. and Edsj\u00f6 1998, preprint astro-ph/9808243\nBengtsson, H.U. et al. 1990, Nucl.

The short and long\ndashed curves refer to the gamma ray emission produced by relativistic bremmstrahlung of a\npopulation of primary cosmic rays and are calculated using the formula given in Sreekumar et\nal. (1996) for two choices of the Coma magnetic field B = 0.3\u03bcG and B = 1\u03bcG, respectively.\n\n\f\u2013 49 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- The gamma-ray emission predicted from \u03c7\u03c7 annihilation in galaxy clusters\n(solid curve) calculated for different neutralino masses: M\u03c7 = 70 GeV (dot-dashed curve),\nM\u03c7 = 100 GeV (solid curve), M\u03c7 = 200 GeV (dotted curve) and M\u03c7 = 300 GeV (dashed\ncurve). The sensitivities of the operating and planned gamma ray experiments are also\nshown. Combined gamma ray observations of clusters from \u223c 1 GeV to 500 GeV can clearly\ndetermine the neutralino mass from both the intensity of the spectrum and its high-energy\ncutoff (see Section 7 for details).\n\n\f"}
