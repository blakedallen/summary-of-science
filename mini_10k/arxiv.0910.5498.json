Here we adapt techniques from compressive\nsensing to exponentially reduce the experimental configurations required for quantum process tomography. Our\nmethod is applicable to dynamical processes that are known to be nearly-sparse in a certain basis and it can\nbe implemented using only single-body preparations and measurements. We perform efficient, high-fidelity\nestimation of process matrices on an experiment attempting to implement a photonic two-qubit logic-gate. The\ndata base is obtained under various decoherence strengths. We find that our technique is both accurate and noise\nrobust, thus removing a key roadblock to the development and scaling of quantum technologies.\n\nUnderstanding and controlling the world at the nanoscale-\nbe it in biological, chemical or physical phenomena-requires\nquantum mechanics. It is therefore essential to characterize and monitor realistic complex quantum systems that inevitably interact with typically uncontrollable environments.\nOne of the most general descriptions of open quantum system dynamics is a quantum map-typically represented by\na process matrix [1]. Methods to identify the process matrix are collectively known as quantum process tomography\n(QPT) [1\u20134]. For a d-dimensional quantum system, they require O(d4 ) experimental configurations: combinations of input states, on which the process acts, and a set of output observables. For a system of n of the simplest quantum objects,\nnamely qubits -two-level quantum systems-d=2n . The required physical resources hence scale exponentially with system size. In principle, a single generalized measurement is\nsufficient for full process tomography in a extended Hilbert\nspace relying on highly nonlocal many-body measurements\nthat are physically unavailable [5]. Recently, a number of alternative methods have been developed for efficient and selective estimation of quantum processes [6\u20138]. However, full\ncharacterization of quantum dynamics of comparably small\nsystems, such as a recently demonstrated 8-qubit ion trap [9],\nwould still require over a billion experimental configurations,\nclearly a practical impossibility. So far, process tomography\nhas therefore been limited by experimental, and-to a lesser\nextent-by off-line computational resources, to systems of 2\nand 3 qubits [10\u201312].\nHere we adapt techniques from compressive sensing (CS)\nto develop an experimentally efficient method for QPT. It requires only O(s log d) configurations if the process matrix is\ns-compressible in some known basis, i.e., it is nearly sparse\nin that it can be well approximated by an s-sparse process\nmatrix. This is usually the case, because engineered quantum systems aim to implement a unitary process which is\nmaximally-sparse in its eigenbasis. In practice, as observed\nin QPT experiments in liquid-state NMR [13\u201315], photonics\n[10, 16, 17], ion traps [18], and superconducting circuits [11],\na near-unitary process will still be nearly-sparse in this basis, and still compressible. The near sparsity emanates from\n\ndecoherence originating in few dominant system-environment\ninteractions. This is more apparent for weakly decohering systems [19, 20].\nWe experimentally demonstrate our algorithm by estimating the 240 real parameters of the process matrix of a canonical photonic two-qubit gate, Fig. 1, from a reduced number\nof configurations. For example, from just 18 and 32 configurations, we obtain fidelities of 94% and 97% with process\nmatrices obtained from an overcomplete set of all 576 available configurations.\nCompressive sensing provides methods for compression of\ninformation carried by a large-size signal into a significantly\nsmaller one along with efficient convex optimization algorithms to decipher this information [21, 22]. Originally developed to exploit compressible features of natural audio and\nvideo signals, applications of compressive sensing have recently found their way to quantum tomography: Simulations\nof compressive sensing for QPT [23], application to ghostimaging [24], and quantum state tomography for low-rank\ndensity matrices [25]. The latter provides a quadratic reduction of physical resources compared to standard state tomography, i.e., for a density matrix of rank r, O(rd log2 d) vs.\nstandard d2 settings, and it also has the main advantage that\nrank is basis independent.\nUnder reasonable assumptions, a quantum map on a ddimensional space has the general representation [1],\n2\n\nS(\u03c1)=\n\nd\nX\n\n\u03c7\u03b1\u03b2 \u0393\u03b1 \u03c1\u0393\u2020\u03b2\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b1,\u03b2=1\n\nwhere \u03c7, the d2 \u00d7 d2 process matrix, is positive semidefinite,\nP\n\u03c7\u22650, and trace preserving, \u03b1,\u03b2 \u03c7\u03b1\u03b2 \u0393\u2020\u03b2 \u0393\u03b1 =Id , with {\u0393\u03b1 }\nan orthonormal matrix basis set, Tr(\u0393\u2020\u03b2 \u0393\u03b1 )=\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 . Note that\nsparsity is a property of the map representation not the map\nitself. Data is collected by preparing an ensemble of identical systems in one of the states {\u03c11 , ..., \u03c1k }, inputting them\nto the process \u03c7, and then measuring an observable M from\nthe set {M1 , ..., M` }. For a pair (\u03c1, M ), the outcome will\nbe yM,\u03c1 =Tr(S(\u03c1)M ). If the experiment is repeated for all\n\n\f2\nconfigurations, i.e., (\u03c1i , Mi ), i=1, . . . , m=k`, the relation between the vector of outcomes y=[yM1 ,\u03c11 , . . . , yMm ,\u03c1m ]T and\nthe true process matrix, denoted by \u03c70 , can be represented by\na linear map y=\u03a6~\n\u03c70 , where \u03c7\n~ 0 is the vectorized form of the\nprocess matrix \u03c70 and \u03a6 is an m\u00d7d4 matrix of coefficients of\n\u221a\nthe form Tr(\u0393\u03b1 \u03c1i \u0393\u2020\u03b2 Mi )/ m.\nIn general, estimating a sparse process matrix with an unknown sparsity pattern from an underdetermined set of linear\nequations (m<d4 ) would seem highly unlikely. Compressive\nsensing, however, tells us that this can be done by solving for\n\u03c7 from the convex optimization problem:\nminimize k~\n\u03c7k`1 subject to ky \u2212 \u03a6~\n\u03c7k`2 \u2264 \u03b5,\n\n(2)\n\nand positive-semidefinite and trace-preserving conditions as\ndefined above. The parameter \u03b5 quantifies the level of uncertainty in the measurements, that is, we observe y=\u03a6\u03c70 +w\nwith kwk`2 \u2264 \u03b5. From [22, 26], recovery via (2) is ensured if\n(i) the matrix \u03a6 satisfies the restricted isometry property:\n\na)\n\nb)\nState Preparation\nQWP\n\nHWP\n\nGate\n\nTomography\nAPD\n\nPBS\n\nFIG. 1: Experimental scheme.

The restricted isometry property states that two ssparse process matrices \u03c71 (s) and \u03c72 (s) can be distinguished\nif their relative distance is nearly preserved after the measurements, i.e., under transformation by \u03a6. If the measurements are noise free, \u03b5=0, and the process matrix is actually s-sparse, \u03c70 =\u03c70 (s), then the right hand side of (C2) is\nzero leading to perfect recovery, \u03c7? =\u03c70 . Otherwise the solution tends to the best s-sparse approximation of the process matrix plus the additional term due to measurement error \u03b5. If for an n-qubit QPT with d=2n the conditions of\nthe above analysis are satisfied, then the number of experimental configurations m scales linearly with sn, specifically,\nm\u2265C0 s(4n log 2\u2212 log s)=O(sn). In the appendix, using the\nmeasure concentration properties of random matrices, following the arguments in [22, 26], we show that if \u03a6 is constructed from random input states {\u03c1i }, and random observables {Mi }, then the restricted isometry in (3) holds with high\nprobability. Also a test is presented to certify the sparsity assumption.\nA nearly-sparse process matrix can thus be encoded into\nan exponentially smaller number of measurement outcomes,\nwhich can be recovered to within the bounds of (C2) by\nsolving (2). We now test our algorithm experimentally\nagainst standard QPT on a two-qubit gate under a range\nof decoherence-and thus sparsity-conditions.

Error bars are obtained by solving (2) for 50 different\nrandom combinations of m inputs and observables.\n\nqubits are encoded in orthogonal polarization states of single\nphotons (|Hi, horizontal, and |V i, vertical). We performed\nfull process tomography [10, 16, 17] of the gate with both\n2-photon and 4-photon arrangements, preparing 16 pair-wise\ncombinations of the 4 input states {|Hi, |V i, |Di, |Ri}\nand, for each input, measuring 36 two-qubit combinations of the observables {|Hi,\n|V i, |Di, |Ai, |Ri, |Li},\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere\n|Di=(|Hi+|V\ni)/\n2,\n|Ai=(|Hi\u2212|V\ni)/ 2,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n|Ri=(|Hi+i|V i/ 2, and |Li=(|Hi\u2212i|V i/ 2.

The CQPT estimation accuracy is excellent for low noise,\nand reliable even for high noise, see Appendix G for more details.\n\ntained by solving (2) with y=Csel p and \u03a6=Csel G where p\nis the 576 \u00d7 1 experimental probabilities corresponding to\neach of the 576 configurations, G is the 576\u00d7256 matrix\nobtained from all the configurations and the basis set [\u0393\u03b1\nin (1)],and Csel is the m\u00d7576 matrix corresponding to taking a selection of m \u2264 576 of all possible configurations.\nThe basis set is obtained from the singular-value decomposition of the ideal CZ-gate: the process matrix in this basis is\nmaximally sparse with a single non-zero 1,1-element which\nequals 4. The measurement error\n\u221a bound \u03b5 in (2) is chosen\nto be just slightly larger than m\u03c3, where \u03c3 is the minimum feasible root-mean-square level obtained from (2) using all configurations, i.e., with Csel =I576 . We quantify decoherence using the process purity, P=Tr(\u03c72m /d2 ), which\nvaries from 0 for a completely decohering channel, to 1 for\na unitary process: in our experiment we used six decoherence levels (see Appendix G for details), giving purities of\n{0.62, 0.74, 0.77, 0.79, 0.86, 0.91} \u00b1 0.01.\n\nity of algorithms for real-world experiments.\n\nFigure 2 shows, for the lowest decoherence level, the process fidelities [10] versus the number of randomly-selected\nconfigurations, m. Each process matrix, {\u03c7m }, is obtained by\nsolving (2). We use the fidelity between (i) the compressive\nmeasurement and the ideal, F(UCZ , \u03c7m ); and (ii) the compressed and optimal measurements, F(\u03c7576 , \u03c7m ). Note that\nas m increases the fidelity with the ideal converges to the value\nof 0.89 obtained from \u03c7576 ; likewise, the fidelity with the full\nestimate converges to unity. Similar plots exist for every level\nof decoherence, with fidelities reduced accordingly.\n\nA further crucial test is whether CQPT enables us to locate\nerrors and implement necessary corrections: a common example is identifying local rotations that move the process closer\nto the ideal. By optimising F(UCZ , \u03c732 ), we calculated local\ncorrections to \u03c732 ; applying them to the full estimate \u03c7576 ,\nF(UCZ , \u03c7576 ) improved, on average, over all decoherence levels, by 4.1%. This is very close to the average 4.9% improvement obtained by calculating and applying local corrections\ndirectly to \u03c7576 . Even a low-configuration CQPT estimate of\na noisy process therefore enables improvements.\n\nWe have so far used random selections of probabilities from\nthe full data set, which allows us a comprehensive test of compressive sensing theory. Experiments, however, don't yield\nprobabilities but physical quantities, e.g. count rates. To date,\nalgorithms for more efficient state [25] or process tomography\nhave assumed probabilities as a starting point. Since normalization is an issue to some extent in all physical architectures,\nit will be necessary to investigate the robustness and scalabil-\n\nThat high-fidelity estimates are obtained by CQPT can be\nunderstood from the error bound (C2) which shows that the\nCQPT estimate tends towards the best s-sparse approximation\nof the true process, in this case our best estimate \u03c7576 . Fig. 4\nshows the process matrix elements, sorted by relative magnitude, for low and high noise levels, in two basis sets. The\ns-sparse approximation levels indicated in (C2) are reached\nwhere the matrix elements drop below the error threshold\n\nFor our photonic two-qubit gate, which is lossy and intrinsically probabilistic, the probabilities were obtained by normalising counts using a full basis set of observables extracted\nfrom all measurements, I576 . Having sufficient configurations to allow for normalisation necessarily imposes limits on\nCQPT efficiency: for low m, we are restricted in how random\nour selections can be. (Details and some permissible configurations in Appendix E). As an example, Fig. 3 shows process\nmatrices reconstructed via CQPT from just one of these configurations compared to the respective full data estimates. We\nused 32 combinations of the 16 inputs {|Hi, |V i, |Di, |Ri}\nand 2 observables {|Ri|Ii, |Ii|Ri}, where I is the identity.\nThe agreement is excellent as one can see from the fidelities\nand the correct reproduction of imaginary elements-which\nare ideally zero. Another striking feature is that we obtain\nhighly faithful reconstructions of a non-local process using\nonly local measurements [5].\n\n\f4\na) 1\n\nHamiltonians [29].\n\n\u03c7576 (CZ Basis)\n\nAppendix A: Norms\n\n10-2\n\n10-4\nb) 1\n\nDefinitions of the norms used throughout the paper.

The error threshold, which indicates the required\nnumber of configurations, is shown in grey.\n\n(0.01\u20130.02). For the corresponding m, we can therefore expect a successful, high-fidelity, CQPT reconstruction.

Although the process matrix is still somewhat\nsparse in the Pauli-basis (Fig. 3), the corresponding plots in\nFig. 4 indicate that \u223c100 configurations are needed to obtain\nan estimate of comparable quality. Furthermore, the sorted\nmagnitude values in the CZ basis decay exponentially, which\nis sufficient to declare the process matrix s-compressible, e.g.,\n[27, 28]. Intriguingly, this exponential decay is a signature\nof model-based compressive sensing where the scaling goes\nfrom m=O(s log(d/s)) to m=O(s) [28]. This demands further investigation, since it appears that QPT fits this framework, particularly when the process matrix is expanded in the\nideal basis corresponding to the unitary design goal.\nOur experimental results are supported numerically by simulations of a 2-qubit process, see Appendix H, and of 3-, and\n4-qubit processes, see Appendix I.\nApplying CQPT to larger systems will require careful attention to classical post-processing which-as in QPT-scales\nexponentially. The standard software we used here (see Appendix F), can easily handle 2 and 3 qubit CQPT systems. For\nlarger systems, more specialized software can increase speed\nby orders of magnitude, e.g., [27].\nA number of research directions arise from this work: incorporating knowledge of model structure properties; tightening the bounds on scaling laws; understanding how nearsparsity s and rank r vary with system dimension, d; pursuing highly efficient convex-computational algorithms; and\nselection of optimal configurations. Compressive tomography techniques can also be applied to quantum metrology\nand Hamiltonian parameter estimation: for example, estimating selective properties of biological or chemical interest in\nmolecular systems and nanostructures with typically sparse\n\nInduced `2 norm kAk2\nFrobenius norm kAkfro\nNuclear norm\nkAk?\n\n= supkxk` =1 kAxk`2 = \u03c31\n2\np\npPr\n2\n\u2020\n=\nTr(A\n\u221a A) = Pr i=1 \u03c3i\n= Tr( A\u2020 A) = i=1 \u03c3i\n(A2)\n\nAppendix B: Restricted isometry property from a concentration\ninequality\n\nA common approach to establish the restricted isometry\nproperty (RIP), Eqn.(3) in the paper, for a matrix A \u2208 Cm\u00d7n\nwith m < n is by introducing randomness in the elements\nof this matrix. This approach benefits from measure concentration properties of random matrices. For QPT for the mea4\nsurment matrix \u03a6 \u2208 Cm\u00d7d in Eqn.(2) of the paper, we show\nhow to achieve this with random preparation of the intial states\nand a random selection of the measurement operators. The\nproof is based on the results in [30] which show that if \u03a6 is a\nrandom matrix which satisfies the concentration property,\no\nn\n2\n2\n2\nPr | k\u03a6xk`2 \u2212 kxk`2 | \u2265 \u03b4s kxk`2 \u2264 2e\u22122mC3 (\u03b4s ) , (B1)\n4\n\nfor all x \u2208 Cd , where \u03b4s \u2208 (0, 1) and C3 (\u03b4s ) only depends\non \u03b4s , then \u03a6 satisfies the RIP,\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4s ) kxs k`2 \u2264 k\u03a6xs k`2 \u2264 (1 + \u03b4s ) kxs k`2\n4\n\n(B2)\n\nfor all s-sparse xs \u2208 Cd . This version of RIP is equivalent\nto (3).\nIn classical signal processing, each element of the \u03a6 matrix can be independently selected from a random distribution\nsuch as Gaussian or Bernoulli. For QPT there is no freedom\nfor random independent selection of every element of the \u03a6\nmatrix. However, as described in the paper, the rows of \u03a6\ncan be independently and randomly selected. To see this, recall that for each experimental configuration we can initialize the system randomly in a state \u03c1 \u2208 {\u03c1i \u2208 Cd\u00d7d }ki=1\nand then measure an observable M randomly chosen from\n{Mj \u2208 Cd\u00d7d }`j=1 . The corresponding matrix \u03a6 then has\nm = k` independent random rows {\u03c6\u2020i \u2208 C1\u00d7N }m\ni=1 with\ncorrelated elements of each row since they are functions of\nthe same M and \u03c1. Observe, however, that although \u03a6 is a\nrandom matrix, because it is constructed from quantum states\n\n\f5\nand observables of a finite dimensional system, it is bounded.\n4\nAs a consequence, \u2200x \u2208 Cd , we get,\n(w` /m) kxk`2 \u2264 x\u2020 (\u03c6i \u03c6\u2020i )x \u2264 (wu /m) kxk`2\n2\n2\n2\n` kxk`2 \u2264 E kAxk`2 \u2264 u kxk`2\n2\n\n2\n\n(B3)\n\nwhere E denotes expectation with respect to \u03a6 and\nwu , w` , u, ` are constants. Next we apply,\nHoeffding's concentration inequality Let v1 , ..., vm be\nindependent bounded random variables such that vi falls\nP in\nthe interval [ai , bi ] with probability one.

We also need t+ and t\u2212 to be\npositive that imposes the condition 1 \u2212 \u03b4s < ` \u2264 u < 1 + \u03b4s .\nSince the obervable M can be scaled by any real factor, a\nsufficient condition is u/` < (1 + \u03b4s )/(1 \u2212 \u03b4s ).\nNext we reproduce the connection between the measure\nconcentration (B6) and restricted isometry as demonstrated in\n[30]: Let Xs be a set of vectors with cardinality s: #(Xs ) =\ns. We choose a set Y \u2282 Xs such that kyk`2 = 1 for all y \u2208 Y ,\nwe have miny\u2208Y kx \u2212 yk`2 \u2264 \u03b4s /4 for all x \u2208 Xs . The cardinality of such a set Y can always be chosen to be smaller\nthan (12/\u03b4s )s [31]. There from (B6) we find\nn\no\n\u22122m(\u03b4s /2+\u000f)2\n2\nPr | k\u03a6yk`2 \u2212 1| \u2265 \u03b4s /2 \u2264 2(12/\u03b4s )s e (wu \u2212w` )2\n2\n\nor equivalently 1 \u2212 \u03b4s /2 \u2264 k\u03a6yk`2 \u2264 1 + \u03b4s /2 holds with\nprobability exceeding\nP = 1 \u2212 2(12/\u03b4s )s exp(\u22122m(\u03b4s /2 + \u000f)2 /(wu \u2212 w` )2 ).\nDefine z to be the smallest number such that k\u03a6x0 k`2 \u2264 1 + z\nfor all x0 with kx0 k`2 = 1. For a vector y \u2208 Y we have,\nk\u03a6x0 k`2 \u2264 k\u03a6yk`2 + k\u03a6(x0 \u2212 y)k`2 \u2264 1 +\n\n\u03b4s\n\u03b4s\n+ (1 + z)\n2\n4\n\nfrom which it follows that z < \u03b4s , for any 0 < \u03b4s < 1.\nIn a similar fashion we can prove 1 \u2212 \u03b4s \u2264 k\u03a6x0 k`2 . This\n\ncompletes the proof that RIP (3) holds with probability exceeding P for all\n\u0001 x \u2208 Xs . The number of sets Xs with\n#Xs = s is Ns \u2264 (eN/s)s . Therefore RIP fails to be satisfied with probability 2 exp(\u22122m(\u03b4s /2 + \u000f)2 /(wu \u2212 w` )2 +\ns[log(eN/s) + log(12/\u03b4s )]). For a sufficiently small constant\nC0 , if C0 s \u2264 m/log(N/s), we can find a constant 0 < C3\nsuch that the probability of a failure of RIP becomes smaller\nthan exp(\u2212C3 m) provided that C3 \u2264 2m(\u03b4s /2 + \u000f)2 /(wu \u2212\nw` )2 \u2212 s[log(eN/s) + log(12/\u03b4s )]. This guaranteed exponentially small chance of RIP failure is the key to the logarithmic\nscaling of the resources in CQPT. If RIP is satisfied the l1\nnorm minimization algorithm works to find a sparse solution.\nHere we proved that by increasing the number of configurations m would exponentially decrease the chance of RIP failure. This completes the connection between the concentration\nmeasure (B6) and the restricted isometry property.\nAppendix C: Performance of the algorithm\n\nIn Ref.

If the measure\nk\u03c7m+1 \u2212 \u03c7m k`1 , which quantifies an incremental improvement in the estimated process matrix, converges toward zero\nfor a polynomially large m, the sparsity assumption is certified.\nAppendix E: Normalization and Precision Issues\n\nIn the formulation of CQPT a random selection of the expectation values yMi ,\u03c1i are not available in our experiment. Due\nto photon loss the detector counts are not conclusive, hence, a\ncomplete set of counts corresponding to a complete set of observables is required to produce meaningful expectation values yMi ,\u03c1i . A solution to this problem is to limit the measurements to few-body observables.

Since m, the number of measurements, is exponentially small we can choose k limited to few-body operators, k = kmax , and even single-body as we did in the experiment. For a fully random selection of observables, the total\nnumber of measurements m will be increased by a constant\nfactor 2kmax . Still this number is exponentially small. This redundancy, however, can be avoided by using the outcomes of\nall 2k observables. This selection scheme is not fully random,\nrather it is a deterministic-random way of choosing observables.\nAs discussed in the paper, random selections of probabilities from the full data set, although exhibiting results which\nare entirely consistent with compressive sensing theory, are\ninconsistent with how data is actually collected in this kind\nof standard photonic experiment. In practice we are limited\nto measure few-body observables. For low m, the configurations must allow for normalisation, i.e. we are restricted in\nhow random our low-number selections can be. A selection\nof some of these permissible configurations are shown in Table I. Here we see some of the remarkable results promised by\nthe theory of compressed sensing, e.g., a 98% fidelity from 32\nconfigurations and a 94% fidelity from only 18 configurations.\nAnother issue to consider is experimental precision. The\nexpectation values of k-body observables of random states reduce for a larger k. This implies the need for a larger number\nof statistical samples. Fortunately, this issue is not a problem\nfor our scheme since we can take k as small as we want, as\ndiscussed above.\n\nAppendix F: Classical postprocessing\n\nThe estimation results computed from the experimental data\nwere all obtained by solving equation 2 in the main text by\nusing \"off-the-shelf\" MATLAB based software. Specifically,\nwe used YALMIP to call the convex solver SDPT3 [32, 33].\nOn a standard desktop it takes about 2 sec of CPU-time to\nsolve (2) for the full 576 configuration set. This software can\nhandle 3-qubit systems but it is more advisable to migrate to\nmore specialized software where orders of magnitude speed\nincreases are possible, e.g., [27].\n\nThe quantum gate used in the experiment is a photonic\ncontrolled-phase gate, Fig. 5 [34\u201336]. It is based on a single partially polarising beam splitter (PPBS), having different reflectivity, \u03b7V = 31 , \u03b7H =0, for the horizontal and the vertical polarisation of input photons. Due to two-photon interference, the input state |V V i undergoes a \u03c0 phase shift\n|V V i \u2192 \u2212|V V i whenever the two photons leave the PPBS\nthrough different output ports. Correct operation of the gate\nis signalled by a coincidence detection in these output modes;\nthe gate is thus probabilistic, with a success probability of 1/9.\nThe gate acts on photonic qubits created via spontaneous\nparametric downconversion (SPDC). Downconversion is intrinsically a random process: consequently the created states\ncontain small amounts of higher-order emission-e.g. |22i\nas well as the desired |11i-which appear as decoherence in\na quantum process [37, 38]. The ratio of higher order terms\nto the desired photon pair number increases with the pair creation probability, which in turn is proportional to the pump\nlaser power. Once can therefore-to some extent-control the\ndecoherence in a process via the laser power.\nIn order to cover a comprehensive range of decoherence, we\nperformed six experiments with 2-photon states directly created via a single SPDC emission, and one experiment with\n4-photon states created in two independent SPDC sources,\nwhere one photon of each SPDC process was used as a trigger.\nThe latter experiment is more representative of large-scale\nsystems, where independent photon sources will be required.\nIt has significantly reduced count rates, and reduced twophoton interference between photons in the quantum gate due\nto both the pump-induced decoherence and group-velocity\nmismatch [37], reflected in the low purity of the process in\nthis case of 0.62.\nTypical count rates for 2-photon experiments are 2000 coincident counts per second, full QPT, building up reasonable\nstatistics, takes about 2.5 hours; in contrast, 4-photon experiments have much lower rates, 1 four-fold coincidence per second, and take 2 days. The 32-configuration CQPT reduces\ntomography times to 8 minutes and 2.6 hours respectively: a\nclear advantage.\nFig. 6 shows the effect of varying laser pump power on\nCQPT estimation accuracy for one of the single-observable\n\n\f7\n1\n1\n\n0.95\n\n0.95\n\n0.9\n0.85\n\nFidelity\n\n0.9\n\n1\n0.85\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n0.75\n\n1\n0.7\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\nPurity (\u03c7576)\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n\nFIG. 6: Fidelities vs. purities for m = 32 corresponding to the\nconfigurations in Table I.\n\nconfigurations from Table I. Specifically for the 32 configurations arising from all combinations of the 16 inputs HVDRxHVDR and 2 outcomes {RI,IR}. As pump power increases,\nthe process purity, as measured by Tr(\u03c72576 )/16 decreases;\neffectively the signal to noise ratio deteriorates. As might be\nexpected, the worst-case fidelity decreases with process purity. The estimated channel fidelity is however remarkably\nrobust, staying very close to the actual channel fidelity.\n\nAppendix H: Simulation results\n\nQPT is performed by solving (2) with noise-free experiments (\u000f = 0) for a system designed to be a 2-qubit quantum\nFourier transform (QFT) with unitary representation Uqft \u2208\nC4\u00d74 , which interacts with an unknown environment via the\ntotal constant Hamiltonian, H=Ie \u2297 Hqft +\u03b3 H\u0303 with kH\u0303k=1;\n\u03b3 is thus the interaction magnitude. The simulated system\n\u03c7sim \u2208 C16\u00d716 is extracted via the partial trace over the environment for \u03b3 \u2208 {0.5, 1.0, 1.25}. Each of these induces\na fidelity with respect to the ideal unitary, F(Uqft , \u03c7sim ) \u2208\n{0.70, 0.80, 0.95} The estimates from (2) are obtained in the\nsingular value decomposition (SVD)-basis [\u0393\u03b1 in (1)] of the\nideal QFT. The process matrix of the ideal unitary in this basis is maximally sparse with the single non-zero 1,1-element\nequal to n = 4 [23]. The environmental interactions make the\nprocess matrix almost sparse as defined in (2).\nTo form the measurement matrix \u03a6 \u2208 Cm\u00d7256 , we randomly generated 4 and 16 input pairs |\u03c81 i \u2297 |\u03c82 i and 2, 4,\nand 6 random selections from the single-body Pauli observables {IX, IY, IZ, XI, Y I, ZI}. This gives 6 configurations\nwith m \u2208 {8, 16, 24, 32, 64, 96}, for which u/` \u2248 1.3 ensuring \u03b4 \u2248 0.13. Fig. 7 shows the fidelities F(\u03c7m , \u03c7sim ) of the\nreconstructed estimates \u03c7m and the simulated process matrices \u03c7sim for all 18 combinations of m and interaction magnitudes \u03b3.\nThese results arise from the relative sparsity of the process\n\n8\n\n16\n\n24\n\n32\n\n64\n\n96\n\nConfigurations (m)\n\nFIG. 7: Fidelities vs. configurations for each process matrix estimate \u03c7m from (2) in the SVD basis of the ideal QFT unitary.

Fig. 8 shows 3D bar\nplots of the real and imaginary elements of the true and estimated process matrices for m = 64, F(Uqft , \u03c7sim ) = 0.70,\nand F(\u03c764 , \u03c7sim ) = 0.93. In the SVD-basis (row 2), the true\nprocess matrix exhibits the expected large 1,1-element with\nthe remaining elements much smaller by comparison. The estimated channel fidelity is 0.71.\nIn Fig. 7, F(\u03c7m , \u03c7sim ) (white bars) trends to increase with\nm, more so for F = 0.7 than for F = 0.95, and rises a bit\nsharply at different m values. Just as for the experimental\nresults, this can be connected to the actual sparsity of the simulated process matrices. Figure 9, just like Fig. 4 in the main\ntext, shows the absolute sorted process matrix elements relative to the 1,1-element. Where each plot crosses the threshold\nof 0.02, we see that the number of elements above this value\nincreases with decreasing decoherence \u03b3. If these are taken\nas the s-sparse approximation levels indicated in the theory\n(2), then (approximately) s \u2208 {30, 50, 100} correspond to\nF(Uqft , \u03c7sim ) \u2208 {0.95, 0.80.0.70}. This correlates well with\nhow F(\u03c7m , \u03c7sim ) varies with resources m.\nAppendix I: Beyond 2-qubits\n\nStandard QPT scales exponentially, thus for 3 and 4 qubits\nthe number of required experimental configurations is, respectively 4,032 and 65,280. As we have shown theoretically, experimentaly, and lastly via the previous simulations, CQPT\nshows quite a different scaling. Fig. 10 shows the absolute\nvalues, sorted by relative magnitude, of the process matrices\narising from a random selection of a perturbed system near\nidentity, i.e., a quantum memory, corresponding to similar fi-\n\n\f8\nRe(\u03c7sim)\n\nIm(\u03c7sim)\n\ndelities. The process matrices elements are shown in a basis corresponding to the ideal identity. Again taking 0.01 as\na threshold we see that for 2-qubits we get m \u2248 20 which\nis similar to our experimental results and those supported by\nthe plots in Figures 4 and 9. Fig. 10 predicts for 3-qubits\nm \u2248 100, and for 4-qubits m \u2248 300. These simulation results\nshow first that the process matrices are compressible, and in\naddition are consistent with the experimental results in Fig. 4.\nTo actually perform the estimaton, that is solve (2), as previously mentioned, requires specialized compressed sensing\n\n0.2\n0.2\n0\n0\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.2\n\n4\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22120.2\n\nAbsolute values of \u03c7 in SVD basis\n\n0\n\n10\n\nd=22, p=240, F = 0.84\nd=23, p=4032, F = 0.83\nd=24, p=65,280, F = 0.85\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\nRe(\u03c764)\n\nIm(\u03c764)\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n0.2\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22120.2\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nFIG. 8: Real and imaginary \u03c7 elements for m=64, F(U qft, \u03c7sim ) =\n0.71, \u03b3=1.25.
