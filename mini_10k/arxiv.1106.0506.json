Nannyonga\u2217, J.Y.T. Mugisha & L.S. Luboobi\nDepartment of Mathematics, Makerere University. Box 7062, Kampala, Uganda\n\nABSTRACT In this paper, a co-infection of malaria and visceral helminthiasis with immune\nstimulation and impairment is studied. We have assumed that an individual gets malaria infection during invasion by helminths larvae. In absence of immune response, our results show\nthat the antigens invade the blood system if the rate of red cell rupture per invading merozoite\nis greater than one. If fewer merozoites are released, the initial state is globally asymptotically\nstable. If more merozoites are released, there exists malaria-only endemic point. However,\nboth antigens coexist if the mean infection burden is greater than one. In this case, there is\na threshold value for drug action below which no recovery of host is expected. In presence\nof immune response, three equilibrium states exist. The initial invasion state, and secondly,\nthe unstable state when the immune population has been triggered and the antigens have\nbeen eliminated. The third state represents the endemic state which is stable if the infectioninduced rupture rate per erythrocyte with immune activation is less than the total mortality\nof the erythrocytes. A model for severity of the co-infection shows that an immune response\nwill be delayed until immunological barrier values for malaria and helminths are exceeded.\n\nKeywords: Within-host co-infection; Malaria; Visceral helminthiasis; immune\nresponse, suppression, impairment; permanence; persistence.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSpecifically, in this model of immune reaction, we explore if an asymptotic decrease of antigen quantity is\nreached, the cause of periodic course of the illness, and if there is unlimited growth of the antigen quantity\nwithin the human, and under what conditions. The model allows a description of threshold relationship\nbetween the infection process and the initial dose of the antigen. We seek to determine whether destruction of either malaria parasites or helminths larvae is possible without spread of infection, destruction\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor: bnk@math.mak.ac.ug\n\n\fafter either infection, coexistence with specific antibodies, a possibility of recurrent course of infection of\neither disease, and if there is unlimited multiplication of either malaria parasites, or helminths larvae. It\nis expected that this co-infection model will give a new insight to researchers in designing experiments for\ndiscovering the underlying mechanism of immune response and suppression in within-host malaria and\nvisceral helminthiasis co-infection. We have assumed a normal functioning of the immune system where\nthere is no distinction between the cellular and humoral components of immunity fighting the malaria\nparasites and helminths larvae that have penetrated into the human blood circulation but that a human\nbeing has such defense components, we refer to as antibodies no matter whether it is a cellular-lymphoid\nsystem, or humoral-immunoglobulin system of immunity [11].\n\n2\n\nModel formulation\n\nThe biologically known within-host dynamics of visceral helminths are such that when a mosquito or\nfly carrying microfilarial larvae bites a new host, it deposits larvae into the subcutaneous tissue of the\nhost. The larvae find their way into the lymph vessels where they take about a year to mature. The\nmature adult female produces larvae called microfilaria. These escape from the lymphatics to reach blood\ncirculation. It is from here where mosquitoes biting the infected person ingest them [11]. The ingested\nmicrofilaria develop in the mosquitoes to reach the infective stage of microfilaria and then transmit them\nto the next human victim when they bite him. This is similar to the transmission of malaria parasites.\nThe injected larvae migrate from blood stream into the lymphatics thus completing the life cycle; when\nthey mature into adult filarial worms. Microfilaria appear in plenty in blood circulation at distinct times\nof the day, usually in the evenings and at night. This characteristic phenomenon is referred to as periodicity and appears to be related to the biting habits of the transmitting mosquitoes.\n\nIn humans, malaria parasites grow and multiply first in the liver cells and then in the red cells of the\nblood. In the blood, successive broods of parasites grow inside the red cells and destroy them, releasing\ndaughter parasites (merozoites) that continue the cycle by invading other red cells.\n\nThe blood stage parasites are those that cause the symptoms of malaria. When certain forms of blood\nstage parasites (gametocytes) are picked up by a female Anopheles mosquito during a blood meal, they\nstart another different cycle of growth and multiplication in the mosquito. After 10-18 days, [11], the\nparasites are found (as sporozoites) in the mosquito's salivary glands. When the Anopheles mosquito\ntakes a blood meal on another human, the sporozoites are injected with the mosquito's saliva and start\nanother human infection when they parasitize the liver cells. Thus, the mosquito carries the disease from\none human to another (acting as a vector). Differently from the human host, the mosquito vector does\n\n2\n\n\fnot suffer from the presence of the parasites [11].\n\nConsider a population of Ne (t) erythrocytes in an individual. Let the uninfected erythrocytes be Ue (t).\nAssuming an invasion of malaria parasites (merozoites) with concentration M (t). At the same time, assume that the individual is attacked by a mass of helminths larvae H(t). Each of these two parasites\ninvade random red blood cells and impregnants them. When the invasion is successful, the uninfected\ncell becomes infected. Let the body of infected red blood cells be Ie (t). Therefore Ne (t) = Ue (t) + Ie (t).\nAfter infection, immune responses against the malaria parasites and helminths larvae are triggered. A\nwide body of evidence indicates that protective anti-blood stage immunity is dependent upon CD4+ T\ncells [44]. Therefore, effective immunity is considered as a population of activated T cells and assume\nthat the resulting immune response is a direct function of their density. The magnitude of the immune\nresponse is proportional to the density of the immune cells. The immune cells augment the clearance of\nthe merozoites, helminths larva, and infected red blood cells from the body. We assume that immune\nactivation is proportional to the density of the infective stages and the precursors are not limiting. Define\nT (t) as the number of antibodies recruited when their resting precursors contact free merozoites, infected\ncells and free larvae at net rates \u03b3M M, \u03b3I Ie , and \u03b3H H respectively. Let the rate at which the immune\ncells expand be p. This rate of expansion encapsulates the positive feedback upon the immune system.\nWe further assume that a regulatory negative feedback force operates to suppress immune population\ngrowth at a rate proportional to the square of its density, bT 2 [22]. This function implies a regulation of\nthe response at high antigen concentrations, since convex or plateauing relationships between the rate of\nT cell proliferation and antigen concentration is observed [24, 30]. Thus, we have clearance rates of free\nmerozoites and larvae due to B cells and macrophages given by \u03bbM M T and \u03bbH HT respectively. The\nclearance of the infected red blood cells due to T cells is given by \u03bbI Ie T . The rate of change of density of\nimmune cells is described by their proliferation and deaths rates. They proliferate in response to contact\nwith free-merozoites, free larvae and infected red blood cells at rates \u03b3M M, \u03b3H H and \u03b3I Ie respectively.\nWe define the natural clearance rate of the antibodies as \u03bct . All parameters of the model are positive\nreal numbers.\n\nLet the uninfected erythrocytes be recruited from the bone marrow at a per capita rate \u039b. We further\ndefine removal of the erythrocytes due to aging as a per capita rate \u03bce . Let \u03b1M be the per capita rate of\nerythrocyte invasion and comprises of the dual probability of contact between an uninfected erythrocyte\nand a merozoite, and of such a contact resulting in productive invasion. The corresponding invasion term\nfor helminths larvae is \u03b1H . The infected red blood cells experience a per capita death rate \u03b4M due to\ninfection-induced rupture where \u03b4M is large compared to \u03bce . Each ruptured infected cell produces an\naverage of r merozoites such that the net rate of merozoite production is r\u03b4M Ie which is reduced by\ndrug action effect \u01eb. Free merozoites die at natural rate \u03bcM . If the helminths larvae are not ingested\n\n3\n\n\fby a feeding fly or mosquito, they die at a per capita rate \u03bcH . The larvae suffer additional death due\nto prophylaxis at an average rate \u03b4H . If we assume that merozoites and larvae invade erythrocytes at\nrandom, that is, have no predilection for erythrocytes of a particular age or type [22], then the above\ndefinitions and assumptions lead to the following set of non-linear ordinary differential equations:\n\ndUe\ndt\ndIe\ndt\n\n=\n\n\u039b \u2212 \u03bce Ue \u2212 \u03b1M Ue \u2212 \u03b1H Ue\n\n=\n\n\u03b1M Ue + \u03b1H Ue \u2212 \u03bce Ie \u2212 \u03b4M Ie \u2212 \u03bbI Ie T\n\ndM\ndt\n\n=\n\nr\u03b4M (1 \u2212 \u01eb)Ie \u2212 \u03bcM M \u2212 \u03b1M Ue \u2212 \u03bbM M T\n\ndH\ndt\n\n=\n\n\u03a0 \u2212 \u03bcH H \u2212 \u03b4H H \u2212 \u03b1H Ue \u2212 \u03bbH HT\n\ndT\ndt\n\n=\n\n\u03b3M M + \u03b3I Ie + \u03b3H H + pT \u2212 bT 2 \u2212 \u03bct T\n\n(1)\n\nFirst we analyze this system for the case when there is no immune response and determine the\nexistence and nature of the stationary states.\n\n2.1\n\nCriteria for invasion and persistence in the system without immune response\n\nAs in [28], without immune response System (1) simplifies to\n\ndUe\ndt\ndIe\ndt\n\n=\n\n\u039b \u2212 \u03bce Ue \u2212 \u03b1M Ue M \u2212 \u03b1H Ue H\n\n=\n\n\u03b1M Ue M + \u03b1H Ue H \u2212 \u03bce Ie \u2212 \u03b4M Ie\n\ndM\ndt\n\n=\n\nr\u03b4M (1 \u2212 \u01eb)Ie \u2212 \u03bcM M \u2212 \u03b1M Ue M\n\ndH\ndt\n\n=\n\n\u03a0 \u2212 \u03bcH H \u2212 \u03b4H H \u2212 \u03b1H Ue H\n\n(2)\n\nUsing the next generation matrix method we show that the basic reproduction number is given by\n\nRo =\n\n\u039b\n\u03bce \u03b1M r\u03b4M (1\n\n\u2212 \u01eb)\n\n(\u03bce + \u03b4M )(\u03bcM +\n\n\u039b\n\u03bce \u03b1M )\n\n(3)\n\nNext we determine the nature of stability of the system.

The endemic\n\nstate is too complicated to obtain useful analytical results. We use numerical simulation to integrate\nnumerically and obtain the solutions as shown in Figure (1).

Therefore, all eigenvalues of the system have negative real parts. Hence, the following\nresult is obtained:\nLemma 2.1.2 The invasion-free state is locally asymptotically stable as long as R22 < 1 and R12 < 1.\nFor global stability of the initial invasion state, consider the following Lyapunov function,\nL =\n\nIe + M + H\n\nwhich is positive definite \u2200 Ie , M, H as t \u2192 \u221e, with orbital derivative given by\n\nL\u2032 =\n\nIe\u2032 + M \u2032 + H \u2032\n\n=\n\n\u03b1M Ue M + \u03b1H Ue H \u2212 \u03bce Ie \u2212 \u03b4M Ie\n+r\u03b4M (1 \u2212 \u01eb)Ie \u2212 \u03bcM M \u2212 \u03b1M Ue M + \u03a0 \u2212 \u03bcH H \u2212 \u03b4H H \u2212 \u03b1H Ue H\n\n=\n\n\u2212\u03bce Ie \u2212 \u03b4M Ie + r\u03b4M (1 \u2212 \u01eb)Ie \u2212 \u03bcM M M + \u03a0 \u2212 \u03bcH H \u2212 \u03b4H H\n\n\u2264\n\n(r\u03b4M (1 \u2212 \u01eb) \u2212 \u03bce \u2212 \u03b4M )Ie \u2212 \u03bcM M \u2212 \u03bcH H \u2212 \u03b4H H\n\n=\n\n(\u03bce + \u03b4M )(\n\n=\n\n(\u03bce + \u03b4M )(R02 \u2212 1)Ie \u2212 \u03bcM M \u2212 (\u03bcH + \u03b4H )H, where R02 =\n\n\u2264\n\nr\u03b4M (1\u2212\u01eb)\n\u03bce +\u03b4M\n\n\u2212 1)Ie \u2212 \u03bcM M \u2212 \u03bcH H \u2212 \u03b4H H\nr\u03b4M (1\u2212\u01eb)\n\u03bce +\u03b4M\n\n0 if R02 \u2264 1\n\nIt is important to note that helminths larvae invade the blood stream a year after an individual is bitten\nby the fly. It is therefore biologically meaningful to assume that H \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e. With this assumption,\n7\n\n\four system has a maximum invariant set for L\u2032 =0 if and only if R02 \u2264 1 holds and there is no new invasion\nof the red blood cells. Therefore, all the trajectories starting in the feasible region where the solutions\nhave biological meaning approach the positively invariant subset of the set where L\u2032 = 0, which is the set\n\u039b\n\u03bce\n\nwhere Ie = M = 0 and H \u2192 0. In this set Ne \u2192\n\nas t \u2192 +\u221e. This shows that all solutions approach\n\nthe initial invasion steady state. Thus, when R02 \u2264 1, malaria and helminthiasis will be eliminated from\nthe blood circulation. If R02 > 1, then L\u2032 > 0 for Ie , M, Ne , H close to (0, 0, \u03bc\u039be , 0) in \u0393 except Ie = 0.\nThus, the following conclusion is made:\nLemma 2.1.3 The initial invasion state is globally asymptotically stable in \u0393 if R02 \u2264 1. In this case,\nthe co-infection of malaria and helminthiasis will be kept under control. This would mean that fewer\nmerozoites will be released per rupturing infected erythrocyte.\nWhen R02 > 1 then\n\n\u03b4M [r(1\u2212\u01eb)]\n(\u03bce +\u03b4M )\n\n> 1 implying that (1 \u2212 \u01eb) >\n\n(\u03bce +\u03b4M )\n.\nr\u03b4M\n\nThus, \u01eb < 1 \u2212\n\n(\u03bce +\u03b4M )\n.\nr\u03b4M\n\nThis gives a\n\npercentage value of drug action that is sufficient for treatment of the co-infection of malaria and visceral\nhelminthiasis in absence of immune response.

In this case, we have three categories\nof equilibrium: the first is the initial invasion state when the number of helminths larvae released in\nthe blood is small and hence the host is not displaying any symptoms and the immune response is not\ntriggered. This is the naive equilibrium where Ue =\ndT\ndt\n\n\u039b\n\u03bce\n\n= 0, there is a second equilibrium point where Ue =\n\nand Ie = M = T = 0, H \u2248 0. Secondly when\n\n\u039b\n\u03bce\n\nand Ie = M = 0, and H \u2248 0 but T =\n\np\u2212\u03bct\nb .\n\nAt\n\nthis steady state, the immune system has been triggered and the malaria parasites and helminths larvae\n11\n\n\fhave been eliminated and the system has returned to an infection-free state with a degree of residual\nimmunity. The third type of equilibrium represents host-parasite co-existence and is characterized by\nnon-zero levels of Ie , M and H, Ue <\n\n\u039b\n\u03bce\n\nand\np \u2212 \u03bct\n.\nb\n\nT >\n\n(25)\n\nThe endemic state is too complicated to be useful. However, numerical integration shown in Figure (2)\ngive an example of how this endemic state can be attained. We make the following conclusion:\nLemma 2.2.1 In the presence of immune response, there are three equilibria states. The first is the\ninitial invasion state where the helminths larvae die off without being ingested by a feeding fly. The\nsecond steady state is when the immune population has been triggered and the malaria parasites and\nhelminths larvae have been eliminated. In this case the system returns to an infection-free state with a\ndegree of residual immunity. The third state represents non zero values of Ue\u2217 , Ie\u2217 , M \u2217 and H \u2217 .\nFrom this result, we have:\nLemma 2.2.2 In the absence of infection, the immune population (and therefore the naive equilibrium)\nis inherently unstable and will not return to zero once it has been triggered by the presence of malaria\nparasites and helminths larvae.\nFrom Figure 2, we note a delayed immune response and thus an increase in pathogen concentration.\nOnce the immune response is triggered, there is a significant reduction in Ie , M and H.\n\nNext we analyze stability of the states by introducing small perturbations around these states.

If the criterion is not satisfied,\nneither the malaria parasites nor the helminths larvae will be eliminated but either or both will persist\nat an equilibrium density within the host. Alternatively, if a host undergoes successful therapy of either\ninfection or both, and the immune cells have settled at their equilibrium level, this criterion determines\nwhether a new infection is able to overcome the stability of this equilibrium and re-infect the host. The\n14\n\n\foutcome of infection depends upon the balance between malaria parasite and helminths larvae and host\nattributes. As the death rate of the merozoites increases, the immune equilibrium becomes more and\nmore stable and the host is able to eliminate the infection more easily. Similarly, the higher the equilibrium level of immunity\n\np\u2212\u03bct\nb ,\n\nthe greater the malaria parasite invasion rate \u03b1M must be to achieve\n\nreinfection. It is interesting to note that in this system, the stability of the immune equilibrium does not\ndepend upon the rates of T cell activation by the pathogens. However, the speed at which the system\nmoves towards equilibrium will be influenced by the magnitude of these rates.\n\nFor global stability of the initial state equilibrium with immunity, consider the following Lyapunov\nfunction,\nL\n\n= Ie + M + H + T\n\nwhich is positive definite \u2200 Ie , M, H, T as t \u2192 \u221e, with orbital derivative given by\n\nL\u2032 =\n\nIe\u2032 + M \u2032 + H \u2032 + T \u2032\n\n=\n\n\u03b1M Ue M + \u03b1H Ue H \u2212 \u03bce Ie \u2212 \u03b4M Ie \u2212 \u03bbI Ie T + r\u03b4M (1 \u2212 \u01eb)Ie \u2212 \u03bcM M\n\u2212\u03b1M Ue M \u2212 \u03bbM M T + \u03a0 \u2212 \u03bcH H \u2212 \u03b4H H \u2212 \u03b1H Ue \u2212 \u03bbH HT + \u03b3M M\n+\u03b3I Ie + \u03b3H H + pT \u2212 \u03bct T \u2212 bT 2\n\n=\n\n\u2212\u03bce Ie \u2212 \u03b4M Ie + r\u03b4M (1 \u2212 \u01eb)Ie \u2212 \u03bcM M + \u03a0 \u2212 \u03bcH H \u2212 \u03b4H H \u2212 \u03b1H Ie H\n+(\u03b3M \u2212 \u03bbM T )M + (\u03b3H \u2212 \u03bbH T )H + \u03b3I Ie \u2212 \u03bbI Ie T + pT \u2212 \u03bct T \u2212 bT 2\n\n\u2264\n\nr\u03b4M (1 \u2212 \u01eb) + \u03b3I \u2212 (\u03bce + \u03b4M + \u03bbI T )Ie + (p \u2212 \u03bct \u2212 bT )T\n\n=\n\n(\u03bce + \u03b4M + \u03bbI T )( (\u03bceM+\u03b4\n\n=\n\n2\nt\n(\u03bce + \u03b4M + \u03bbI T )(Ri2 \u2212 1)Ie + bT 2 ( p\u2212\u03bc\nbT \u2212 1) where Ri =\n\n\u2264\n\nr\u03b4\n\n(1\u2212\u01eb)+\u03b3I\n+\u03bbI T )\nM\n\n0 if Ri2 \u2264 1 and since\n\np\u2212\u03bct\nbT\n\nt\n\u2212 1)Ie + bT 2 ( p\u2212\u03bc\nbT \u2212 1)\n\nr\u03b4M (1\u2212\u01eb)+\u03b3I\n(\u03bce +\u03b4M +\u03bbI T )\n\n\u22641\n\nRi is defined as the within-host rupture potential of an infected erythrocyte with immune action. Thus,\nthe following result is obtained:\nLemma 2.2.4 In presence of immune response, the initial invasion state is globally asymptotically stable\nin \u0393 if Ri2 \u2264 1. In this case, the immune population has been triggered but the malaria parasites and\nhelminths larvae have been eliminated and the system has returned to an infection-free state with a degree\nof residual immunity.\nThis further leads to the following conclusion:\nLemma 2.2.5 It is further necessary that to avoid reinfection from malaria,\nthe equilibrium level of immunity\n\np\u2212\u03bct\nb ,\n\np\u2212\u03bct\nb\n\n\u226a 1 since the higher\n\nthe greater the malaria parasite invasion rate \u03b1M in presence of\n\nhelminths larvae must be to achieve reinfection.\n15\n\n\fWhen Ri2 > 1, it implies that\n\nr\u03b4M (1\u2212\u01eb)+\u03b3I )\n(\u03bce +\u03b4M +\u03bbI T )\n\n>\n\n1\n\n1\u2212\u01eb>\n\n1\nr\u03b4M\n\n(\u03bce + \u03b4M + \u03bbI T ) \u2212 \u03b3I\n\n\u01eb<\n\n1\u2212\n\n1\nr\u03b4M\n\n(\u03bce + \u03b4M + \u03bbI T ) + \u03b3I\n\nThis expression gives the critical level of drug action below which no recovery is expected.

This gives (a + \u03bbI T )(b + \u03bbM T ) \u2212 cd < 0 implying\nthat \u03bbI \u03bbM T 2 + (b\u03bbI + a\u03bbM )T + (ab \u2212 cd) < 0 and hence, f (T ) = AT 2 + BT + C < 0. At steady\nstate, the non-zero response of immune response satisfies f (T ) = AT 2 + BT + C = 0, and this can be\nanalyzed for the possibility of multiple immune responses.

We define\n\n1\n\u03bcC\n\nas the time it takes the plasma cells to age, implying that \u03bcC (C \u2212 C o )\u25b3t\n\nis the decrease in the number of plasma cells due to aging [28].\n\nLet \u03c1M C and \u03c1H C be the generation of antibodies fighting malaria parasites and helminths larvae by\nplasma cells, giving \u03c1 = \u03c1M + \u03c1H as the total rate of antibodies production by the plasma cells. The total\nnumber of eliminated antigens that were neutralized by antibodies is equal to \u03b3M AM M + \u03b3H AH H, so if\nneutralization of one antigen requires \u03b7M +\u03b7H antibodies, then this implies that \u03b7M \u03b3M AM M +\u03b7H \u03b3H AH H\n18\n\n\fdescribes the total decrease in the number of antibodies due to binding with malaria parasites and\nhelminths larvae. The total drop in antibodies population due to aging, where \u03bcA is the per capita rate\nof decay of antibodies, is given by \u03bcA AM + \u03bcA AH .\n\nNext we consider depletion of the red blood cells during the co-infection of malaria and helminths,\ndue to the decrease in the activity of organs providing the delivery of immunologic materials, such as\nleukocytes, lymphocytes, and antibodies, that are necessary for the struggle with multiplying antigens.\nAssuming that the productivity of the red blood cells depend on the degree of invasion by malaria parasites\nand helminths larvae. Let R be the relative characteristic of a mass of healthy red blood cells and Rd\nthe corresponding characteristic of the healthy red blood cells in an invaded red blood cell mass. Define\nm as 1 \u2212\n\nRd\nR ,\n\nthat is, m is relative characteristic of damage to the red blood cell mass. For non invaded\n\nred blood cells, m is equal to zero naturally, and for completely impregnated red blood cells, m equals\n1. \u03c3M M + \u03c3H H signifies the total degree of depletion of red blood cells. It is assumed that the increase\nin relative depletion of red blood cells is proportional to the number of antigens M + H, described by\n\u03c3M M + \u03c3H H, where \u03c3M , \u03c3H are constants. A decrease in damage is caused by the recovery activity of\nan organism, that is, \u03bcM is the restoration of the red blood cells.\n\n3.1\n\nSteady states during the severity of the co-infection\n\nFor stationary solutions, we equate the derivatives to zero and solve with initial conditions. Note that\nat t = 0, C = C o , A\u2217M = AM , A\u2217H = AH are the values for a non invaded red blood cell mass for\nM = 0 = H. This implies that the trivial solution, describing the healthy state of red blood cells is\nM = 0, H = 0, C = C o , A\u2217M =\n\n\u03c1M C o \u2217\n\u03c1 Co\n, AH = H , m = 0\n\u03bcA\n\u03bcA\n\n(36)\n\nThus we have the following conclusion:\nLemma 3.1.1 The concentration of antigen population and damaged mass of red blood cells at diseasefree state are equal to zero, and the quantities of plasma cells, C and antibodies AM and AH correspond\nto the values of an immunological status of a healthy individual.\nConsider the system of points (M, H, C, AM , AH , m) in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point\n(M \u2217 , H \u2217 , C \u2217 , A\u2217M , A\u2217H , m). Let M (t) = u(t), H(t) = v(t), C(t) = C \u2217 +w(t), AM (t) = A\u2217M +x(t), AH (t) =\nA\u2217H +y(t), m(t) = z(t) where u, v, w, x , y, z are small deviations of functions from this equilibrium state\n(36).

This implies asymptotic stability of the\ninvasion-free state.\nThis leads to the following conclusion:\nLemma 3.1.3 From (35), at steady state, the small infection dose that does not lead to the loss of\nstability is estimated by\n0 < Mo <\n\n\u03bcA (\u03b3M A\u2217 \u2212\u03b2M )\nM\n\u03b2M \u03b3M \u03b7M\n\n= M \u2217 , 0 < Ho <\n\n\u03bcA (\u03b3H A\u2217 \u2212\u03b2H )\nH\n\u03b2H \u03b3H \u03b7H\n\n= H\u2217\n\n(39)\n\nwhere M \u2217 and H \u2217 are the immunological barrier values for malaria and helminthiasis respectively.\nThe immune barrier is exceeded when an infection dose Mo and Ho satisfies conditions Mo > M \u2217 and\nHo > H \u2217 , and is not exceeded otherwise. Biologically, it implies that, if in the case of red blood cell\n20\n\n\finvasion by a small dose of malaria parasites and helminths larvae, the immunological barrier cannot be\nexceeded, then regardless of the infectious dose, the invasion does not develop, that is, the number of\nmalaria parasites and helminths larvae in the organism decreases with time tending to zero, and the red\nblood cells are restored. In addition, the elevation of C o , that is of the level of immunocompetent cells in\n\u03c1M C o\nM\n\u03bcA\n\na healthy red blood cells mass increases the immunological barrier, since A\u2217M =\n\nand A\u2217H =\n\n\u03c1H C o\nH\n\u03bcA\n\nand therefore, it is an effective method of prophylaxis, and possibly, of disease treatment. This leads to\nthe following lemma.\nLemma 3.1.4 The immunocompetent cells threshold values against malaria and helminths are given by\n0 < Mo <\n\n\u03b3M \u03c1M C o \u22121\nM\n\u03b2 2 \u03b3M \u03b7M\n\n= M \u2217 , 0 < Ho <\n\nM\n\no\nwith CM\n=\n\n1\n\u03b3M \u03c1M\n\nand CHo =\n\n1\n\u03b3H \u03c1H\n\n\u03b3H \u03c1H C o \u22121\nH\n\u03b2 2 \u03b3H \u03b7H\n\n= H\u2217\n\n(40)\n\nH\n\nas the threshold values of the immunocompetent cells respectively,\n\nbelow which, no immune response is expected.\n\n3.2\n\nResults of the severity of the co-infection\n\nChronic form of either disease is caused by an insufficiently effective reaction of the immune system\nthat happens when \u03b1M or \u03b1H is small, that is if the immune system's reaction is weak. In this case,\nM \u2192 Mmax and H \u2192 Hmax ; and on the other hand, A\u2217M and A\u2217H drop respectively. The outcome of the\nco-infection depends on the derivatives\nnot change signs. It is noted that\nAH (t) >\n\n\u03b2H\n\u03b3H\n\ndM\ndt\n\ndM\ndt\n\nand\n\ndH\ndt ,\n\nif they can become negative and how long they do\n\n< 0 if M (t) > 0 and AM (t) >\n\n\u03b2M\n\u03b3M\n\nand\n\ndH\ndt\n\n< 0 if H(t) > 0 and\n\n. Thus we have the following conclusion:\n\nLemma 3.2.1 If we assume that infection of either or both malaria and visceral helminthiasis has happened, then the AM (t) >\ndH\ndt\n\n\u03b2M\n\u03b3M\n\nand/or AH (t) >\n\n\u03b2H\n\u03b3H\n\nis the necessary and sufficient condition for\n\ndM\ndt\n\nand\n\nto be negative.\n\nIf the immunological barrier is not to be exceeded, (Mo < M ) and (Ho < H), then only CASE I of the\nfollowing four cases is possible:CASE I\n\ndM\ndt\n\n< 0, dH\ndt < 0 in a large interval of time. In this case, there will be a subclinical form of the\n\nco-infection. This happens since \u03b2M < \u03b3M A\u2217M and \u03b2H < \u03b3H A\u2217H in which case either there is an effective (normal) immune response, when \u03b1M (\u03c1M + \u03c1H ) > \u03bcC \u03b7M \u03b3M and \u03b1H (\u03c1H + \u03c1H ) > \u03bcC \u03b7H \u03b3H , and\nweak response, (immunodeficiency) when \u03b1M (\u03c1M + \u03c1H ) < \u03bcC \u03b7M \u03b3M and \u03b1H (\u03c1H + \u03c1H ) < \u03bcC \u03b7H \u03b3H .\nThat is, when the infection dose is small, lower than the immunological barrier values, the removal of the malaria parasite or helminths larvae from the red blood circulation depends neither\non the doses of infections nor on the strength of immune response. The removal of either antigen\nis provided by the antibody levels A\u2217M or A\u2217H against each disease that are present in the body at\nthe time of infection. When the doses of malaria parasites and/or visceral helminthiasis increase\n21\n\n\fto considerable extents as compared to the immune barrier, the strength of the immune response\nbegins to play an important role.\n\nIn case of \u03b2M > \u03b3M A\u2217M , \u03b2H > \u03b3H A\u2217H ,\n\ndM\ndt\n\n> 0,\n\ndH\ndt\n\n> 0 for an interval (t1 , t2 ), and assuming that\n\nM \u2192 Mmax and H \u2192 Hmax at a point t1 in the interval, and then decrease to M \u2192 Mmin and\nH \u2192 Hmin , we have two cases:\nEITHER\nCASE II\n\ndM\ndt\n\n< 0, dH\ndt < 0 within a sufficiently large time interval (t1 , t2 ) where t2 is the time when\n\nM \u2192 Mmin and H \u2192 Hmin . Hence, acute form of the co-infection is obtained in which case, \u03b2M >\n\u03b3M \u03b7M , \u03b2H > \u03b3H \u03b7H and therefore the immunological barrier against malaria parasites or helminths\nlarvae does not exist. Therefore, there would be a rapid increase of malaria parasites and helminths\nlarvae in the red blood cells up to the values exceeding the infection doses, and then rapidly get\neliminated due to a strong and effective immune response that leads to the production of antibodies\nagainst the malaria parasites and helminths larvae in quantities sufficient for the elimination of both\ninfections. Note that the higher \u03b2M and \u03b2H are, the higher A\u2217M and A\u2217H respectively; hence the\nfaster the maximum value of malaria and helminths fighting antigens quantities are attained and\nthe faster the process will stop. This gives the following result:\nLemma 3.2.2 With a high rate of malaria parasite multiplication, or a high rate of red blood\ninvasion by the helminths larvae, or more generally, a high dose of infection by either disease, with\nother parameters constant, the amount of malaria parasites and helminths larvae that stimulate the\nimmune system effectively is attained more quickly.\nThis implies that Mmax or Hmax does not depend on the dose of infection but is determined by\nthe immune status in relation to the malaria parasites or helminths larvae; that is, by the set of\nmodel parameters. The dose of the infection affects the time when Mmax or Hmax is reached. In\nthis form of infection, there is red blood depletion due to malaria, \u03c3M and due to helminths, \u03c3H .\nOR\nCASE III\n\ndM\ndt\n\n< 0, dH\ndt < 0 within a sufficiently small time interval (t1 , t2 ), then the chronic form of the\n\nco-infection is expected.\nIf however a point t1 does not exist, that is if,\nCASE IV\n\ndM\ndt\n\n> 0, dH\ndt > 0 within an infinitely large interval of time, then a lethal outcome of the\n\nco-infection is obtained. This happens when the formation of plasma cells is delayed and in turn a\ndelay in the production of antibodies specific to malaria parasites or helminths larvae. This leads\nto the following result:\n\n22\n\n\fLemma 3.2.3 In order to prevent a hyper-toxic form of the co-infection of malaria and helminthiasis, it is necessary to delay the replication rate of malaria parasites \u03b2M and the invasion rate of\nhelminths larvae, \u03b2H .\n\n3.3\n\nThreshold values for the severity of the co-infection\n\nIf both or one of the antigens is eliminated, then from (35) at steady state, the following equilibria exist:\n\n\u03c1\n\nC\n\n\u03c1 C\n\n= (0, 0, C, \u03bcM , \u03bcH , 0) the disease-free,\nA\nA\ni\nh\n\u03bcA \u03bcC\n\u03b1 \u03b2H \u03bcA\n\u03c1 \u03b1 \u03b2H \u03bcA\n\u03b2\n= 0, (\u03b1 \u03c1 \u2212\u03bc\n, \u03b3 (\u03b1 \u03c1H \u2212\u03bc\n, \u03bc \u03b3 (\u03b1M \u03c1H \u2212\u03bc\n, \u03b3H ,\n\u03b3\n\u03b7\n)\n\u03b3\n\u03b7\n)\n\u03b3\n\u03b7\n)\nH H\nC H Hi\nH\nH H\nC H H\nA H\nH H\nC H H\nH\nh\n\nEo\nEH\n\n\u03c3H \u03bcC \u03bcA\n\u03bcM (\u03b1H \u03c1H \u2212\u03bcC \u03b3H \u03b7H )\nh\n\u03b1M \u03b2M \u03bcA\n\u03b2M\n\u03bcA \u03bcC\n= (\u03b1 \u03c1 \u2212\u03bc\n\u03b3M \u03b7M ) , 0, \u03b3M (\u03b1M \u03c1M \u2212\u03bcC \u03b3M \u03b7M ) , \u03b3M\nM\nM\nC\ni\nh\n\u03c3M \u03bcA \u03bcC\n\u03bcM (\u03b1M \u03c1M \u2212\u03bcC \u03b3M \u03b7M )\n\nEM\n\n,\n\n\u03c1H \u03b1M \u03b2M \u03bcA\n\u03bcA \u03b3M (\u03b1M \u03c1M \u2212\u03bcC \u03b3M \u03b7M )\n\n(41)\ni\n\n,\n\nwhere endemicity of either equilibrium depends on the respective threshold values.\nFor competitive dominance of helminths larvae by the malaria parasites, the following equilibrium point\nwill be attained :\n\nEMH =\n\u03b2M\n\u03b3M\n\n,\n\n\u03b2H\n\u03b3H\n\n\u03bcA\n\u03bcA \u03bcC\n\u03bcA [\u03b1M (\u03c1M +\u03c1H )+\u03bcC \u03b7M (\u03b2M \u2212\u03b3M )]\n,\n\u03b7M \u03b3M (R2 \u22121) , \u03b1H (\u03c1M +\u03c1H )(1\u2212R2 ) ,\n\u03bcC \u03b7M \u03b3M \u03c1M (R2 \u22121)\neM\noH\neM\n\u03c3 \u03bc\n, \u03bcM \u03b7 \u03b3M (RA2 \u22121)\nM M\n\n(42)\n\neM\n\n2\n2\nwith ReM\n> 1 > RHo\nwhere ReM is the basic reproductive potential for a successful malaria dominance\n\nin presence of helminths and\n2\nReM\n=\n\n\u03b1M (\u03c1M +\u03c1H )\n\u03bcC \u03b7M \u03b3M ,\n\n2\nRoH\n=\n\n\u03bcC \u03b7H \u03b3H\n\u03b1H (\u03c1M +\u03c1H )\n\n(43)\n\nThus, we obtain the following result:\n2\n2\nLemma 3.3.1 For competitive exclusion of visceral helminthiasis by malaria, ReM\n> 1 > RHo\n.

This gives the following result:\n24\n\n\fLemma 3.3.3 The malaria parasites and helminths larva will co-exist, for strong sub thresholds and\none of them will dominate the other for weak sub thresholds. This implies that there may be competitoroscillatory coexistence until the system bi-stabilizes to endemic equilibria, depending on the immune action\nagainst either or both antigens.\nFurther from the above lemma, the following conclusion is made:\nLemma 3.3.4 For endemicity of the within-host co-infection of malaria and visceral helminthiasis, one\nof the reproduction numbers must be greater than 1 and coexistence equilibria exists; no coexistence exists\nwhen both reproductive potentials are greater than 1.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the model for the co-infection of malaria and visceral helminthiasis, we have assumed that an individual gets malaria infection during invasion by helminth larvae. In absence of immune response, our results\nshow that there is no disease-free state, but an endemic state is attained via damped oscillations towards\na fixed point (see Figure 1 A,C and B). Our results showed that antigens invade the blood system if\nthe rate of red cell rupture per invading merozoite is greater than one as seen in Lemma 2.1.1. If more\nmerozoite are released, there exists malaria-only endemic point. However, both antigens co-exist if the\nmean infection burden is greater than one. In this case, there is a threshold value for drug action below\nwhich no recovery of host is expected, Lemma 2.1.4. In presence of immune response, three equilibrium\nstates exist. The initial invasion state, and secondly, the unstable state when the immune population\nhas been triggered and the antigens have been eliminated. The third state represents the endemic state\nwhich is stable if the infection-induced rupture rate per erythrocyte with immune activation is less than\nthe total mortality of the erythrocyte (see Lemma 2.2.1 and Figure 2). A model for severity of the\nco-infection shows in Figure 2B that an immune response will be delayed until immunological barrier\nvalues for malaria and helminth are exceeded. Our results show further that once the immune response\nis triggered, the system in inherently unstable and will not return to zero, Lemma 2.2.2.\n\nIn this paper, a co-infection of within-host malaria and visceral helmnithiasis is studied. The interest\nwas to study immune response and impairment when bot antigens invade the red blood cells. The process\nof immune response is more complicated than modelled here, but the model has important consequences\nfor the success of disease control programs. This model is a conceptually simple and a logical extension\nof the classic individual species models that have formed the foundation of epidemiological theory over\nthe last 30 years. As such, it should provide a valuable framework for understanding the dynamics\nof parasite co-infection with immune response and evaluating the wide-ranging implications of disease\ncontrol strategies in the future. Although with constraints due to limited data, the study shows that\n25\n\n\fthe epidemiology and population dynamics of within-host-microparasite-macroparasite communities are\nhighly complex, resulting in different predictions from those made by the corresponding single parasite\nspecies models. If better estimates of parameters become available, more detailed studies can be done by\ntaking into account some of the aspects that have been overlooked.\n\n26\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Altizer, S., Dobson, A., Hosseini, P., Hudson, P., Pascual, M. and Rohani, P.
