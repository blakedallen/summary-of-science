B. ZHANG\nAbstract. Quantum homogeneous supervector bundles arising from the quantum\ngeneral linear supergoup are studied. The space of holomorphic sections is promoted\nto a left exact covariant functor from a category of modules over a quantum parabolic\nsub-supergroup to the category of locally finite modules of the quantum general linear\nsupergroup. The right derived functors of this functor provides a form of Dolbeault\ncohomology for quantum homogeneous supervector bundles. We explicitly compute\nthe cohomology groups, which are given in terms of well understood modules over\nthe quantized universal enveloping algebra of the general linear superalgebra.\n\n1. Introduction\nWe follow the general philosophy of non-commutative geometry [3, 11] to study\nquantum homogeneous supervector bundles arising from the quantum general linear\nsupergroup. Our starting point is the quantized universal enveloping algebra Uq (glm|n )\n(see e.g., [20, 23]) of the complex general linear superalgebra glm|n [7, 17]. As is well\nknown, Uq (glm|n ) has the structure of a Hopf superalgebra [14, 13]. Thus its dual superspace Uq (glm|n )\u2217 acquires a natural associative superalgebraic structure. The subspace\nA(glm|n ) of Uq (glm|n )\u2217 spanned by all the matrix elements of the finite dimensional\nUq (glm|n )-representations with integral weights forms a Hopf superalgebra, which may\nbe considered as the superalgebra of functions on the quantum general linear supergroup. This Hopf superalgebra is closely related to the multi-parameter quantization\nof the general linear supergroup of [12], and obviously contains the Hopf superalgebra\nGq of [21] as a Hopf sub-superalgebra.\nFor any given reductive quantum sub-superalgebra Uq (l) of Uq (glm|n ), we consider the\nsubspace A(glm|n , l) of A(glm|n ) invariant with respect to left translations under Uq (l).\nThis subspace forms a sub-superalgebra of A(glm|n ). In the spirit of non-commutative\ngeometry [3, 11], we shall regard A(glm|n , l) as (the superalgebra of functions on) a\nquantum homogeneous superspace, and finite type projective A(glm|n , l)-modules as\n(spaces of global sections of) quantum supervector bundles on the quantum homogeneous superspace. As we shall see, such A(glm|n , l)-modules also admit a natural\nUq (glm|n )-action. This provides an interesting link between the non-commutative geometry of the quantum supervector bundles and the representation theory of Uq (glm|n ).\nIn the context of classical Lie groups, such a link is very well known and constitutes the\nsubject of the Bott-Borel-Weil theory [2] (see [8] for a review on the algebraic theory).\nFor Lie supergroups in the classical setting, the subject was studied by Penkov [15]\n(see also [16]).\nWe shall study a version of Dolbeault cohomology for quantum homogeneous supervector bundles. Our method is based on Zuckerman's algebraic theory of induced\nKeywords. Quantum supergroups, derived functors, non-commutative vector bundles.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

We shall make essential use of\nresults of [1].\nWe promote the space S of global sections and the space \u0393 of holomorphic sections\nof a quantum homogeneous supervector bundle to covariant functors from appropriate\ncategories of modules over quantum sub-superalgebras of Uq (glm|n ) to the category of\nlocally finite Uq (glm|n )-modules. The resultant functors are closely related to a quantum analogue of the Zuckerman functor, which will be introduced in Section 4. The\nderived functors of the 'holomorphic section functor' arising from \u0393 are the Dolbeault\ncohomology groups for quantum homogeneous supervector bundles which we seek for.\nWhen the quantum homogeneous supervector bundle S is induced by a finite dimensional irreducible module over a purely even reductive quantum subalgebra, or a finite\ndimensional dual Kac module (defined by (2.3)) over a general reductive quantum\nsub-superalgebra, we explicitly compute the cohomology groups in Theorem 5.2 and\nTheorem 5.3. The results resemble the classical Bott-Borel-Weil theorem [2] in that\nthe cohomology is concentrated at one degree. However, the non-trivial cohomology\ngroups are isomorphic to dual Kac modules over Uq (glm|n ), thus are not irreducible.\nThe weight spaces of the cohomology groups are worked out.\nThe arrangement of the paper is as follows. Section 2 contains some background material on the general linear superalgebra and its quantized universal enveloping algebra.\nSection 3 introduces the notions of quantum homogeneous superspaces and quantum\nhomogeneous supervector bundles on them, and study some basic properties of theirs.\nSection 4 studies induction functors. The Zuckerman functor is defined, and a version\nof Frobenius reciprocity is proven. Properties of various functors and module categories\nare also established, which are to be used in the next section. In Section 5 we first\npresent the formulation Dolbeault cohomology for quantum homogeneous supervector\nbundles using results of Section 4, then compute the Dolbeault cohomology groups for\nbundles of interest.\n2. Preliminaries\nThis section presents some preliminary material on the general linear superalgebra\nand its quantized universal enveloping algebra, which sets up the stage for the remainder of the paper. The section also serves to fix notations and conventions.\n2.1. The general linear superalgebra glm|n . Through out the paper we shall denote\nby g the complex general linear superalgebra glm|n [7, 17]. Let I = {1, 2, * * * , m + n},\nand I\u2032 = {1, 2, * * * , m + n \u2212 1}. We shall identify g with the Lie superalgebra of\n(m + n) \u00d7 (m + n)-matrices, where the Z2 -grading is specified as follows. Denote by\neab , a, b \u2208 I, the (m + n) \u00d7 (m + n)-matrix unit with all entries being zero except\nthat at the (a, b) position which is 1. We declare eab to be odd if a \u2264 m < b or\na > m \u2265 b, and even otherwise. Then {eab |a, b \u2208 I} forms a homogeneous basis of g.\nThe maximal\neven subalgebra ofP\ng will be denoted by g0 , which is equal to glm \u2295gln . Let\nP\ng+1 = i\u2264m<r Ceir , and g\u22121 = i\u2264m<r Ceri . Then the odd subspace of g is g+1 \u2295 g\u22121 .\nWeLfix the Borel subalgebra b consisting of the upper triangular matrices, and take\nh = a CEaa as the Cartan subalgebra. Let {\u01eba | a \u2208 I} be the basis of h\u2217 such that\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u01eba (Ebb ) = \u03b4ab . The\n\u001a space h is equipped with a bilinear form ( , ) : h \u00d7 h \u2192 C such\n\u03b4ab ,\na \u2264 m,\nthat (\u01eba , \u01ebb ) =\nWe shall denote by h\u2217Z the Z-span of the \u01eba . The set\n\u2212\u03b4ab , a > m.\n\n\fQUANTUM SUPERGROUPS AND NON-COMMUTATIVE BUNDLES\n\n3\n\nof roots of g is {\u01eba \u2212 \u01ebb |a 6= b}, with \u01eba \u2212 \u01ebb being called odd if a \u2264 m < b or b \u2264 m < a,\nand even otherwise. The set of the positive roots relative to the Borel subalgebra b is\n{\u01eba \u2212 \u01ebb | a < b}, and the set of simple roots is {\u01eba \u2212 \u01eba+1 | a \u2208 I\u2032 }. An element \u03bb \u2208 h\u2217 is\ncalled dominant if 2(\u03bb, \u03b1)/(\u03b1, \u03b1) \u2208 Z+ , for all positive even roots of g. Denote by 2\u03c1\nthe signed-sum of the positive roots of g. A \u03bb \u2208 h\u2217 is called g-regular if (\u03bb + \u03c1, \u03b1) 6= 0\nfor all even roots of g.\nThe elements of the following set {ea,a+1 , ea+1,a |a \u2208 I\u2032 } \u222a {ebb |b \u2208 I} generate\ng. We shall call a Lie sub-superalgebra r of g regular if there exist subsets \u0398\u00b1\nof I\u2032 and a subset \u03980 of I such that r is generated by the elements of the set\n{eaa |a \u2208 \u03980 } \u222a {eb,b+1 |b \u2208 \u0398+ } \u222a {ec+1,c |c \u2208 \u0398\u2212 }. The Lie sub-superalgebra r is\ncalled reductive if \u03980 = I and \u0398+ = \u0398\u2212 , and is called parabolic if \u03980 = I, and either\n\u0398+ or \u0398\u2212 is equal to I\u2032 . If r is a parabolic Lie sub-superalgebra, then it contains the\nreductive Lie sub-superalgebra, called the Levi factor of r, generated by the elements\nof the set {eaa |a \u2208 \u03980 } \u222a {eb,b+1 , eb+1,b |b \u2208 \u0398+ \u2229 \u0398\u2212 }. Note that a parabolic Lie subsuperalgebra of g necessarily contains b or the opposite Borel subalgebra b\u0304 spanned by\nthe lower triangular matrices.\n2.2.

These elements are the generalization\nto Uq (glm|n ) of a similar set of elements for Uq (gln ) constructed by Jimbo [6]. They were\nused in [9] for the construction of the universal R-matrix of Uq (glm|n ). We mention\nthat the Eab behave very much like the images of eab in the universal enveloping algebra\n2\n2\nof glm|n . For example, Eab\n= Eba\n= 0, if a \u2264 m < b. More importantly, we have the\nfollowing Poincar\u00e9-Birkhoff-Witt theorem for Uq (g).\nTheorem 2.1. [20, 23] The ordered products of non-negative powers of all the Eab ,\na 6= b, and integer powers of all Kc , c \u2208 I, with respect to any linear ordering of the\nelements of {Eab , Eba |a < b} \u222a {Kc |c \u2208 I} form a basis of Uq (g).\nWe shall assume that every Uq (g)-module to be considered in this paper is Z2 -graded.\nLet V be a Uq (g)-module. A weight vector v \u2208 V is the simultaneous eigenvector of all\nthe Ka , a \u2208 I. We shall say that v is an integral weight vector with weight \u03bc \u2208 h\u2217Z if\nKa v = q (\u03bc,\u01eba ) v,\nh\u2217Z ,\n\n\u2200a.\n\nthe irreducible Uq (g)-module with a highest weight\nWe shall denote by L\u03bb , \u03bb \u2208\nvector which is an integral weight vector with weight \u03bb. The \u03bb will be referred to as\nthe highest weight of L\u03bb . It was shown in [20] that L\u03bb is finite dimensional if and only\nif its highest weight is dominant.\nWe shall call a Hopf sub-superalgebra of Uq (g) a quantum sub-superalgebra. Corresponding to a regular Lie sub-superalgebra r of g specified by the sets \u03980 and \u0398\u00b1 ,\nthere exists an associated quantum sub-superalgebra Uq (r) generated by the elements\nof the following set {Ka , Ka\u22121 |a \u2208 \u03980 } \u222a {Eb,b+1|b \u2208 \u0398+ } \u222a {Ec+1,c |c \u2208 \u0398\u2212 }. Important\nquantum sub-superalgebras are Uq (h) and the two quantum Borel sub-superalgebras\nUq (b) and Uq (b\u0304). If r is a parabolic (respectively reductive) Lie sub-superalgebra of g,\nthen Uq (r) will be called a parabolic (respectively reductive) quantum sub-superalgebra\n\n\fQUANTUM SUPERGROUPS AND NON-COMMUTATIVE BUNDLES\n\n5\n\nof Uq (g). If Uq (p) is parabolic with the Levi factor Uq (l), then we have the Hopf superalgebra inclusions Uq (l) \u2282 Uq (p) \u2282 Uq (g).\nFor later use, we consider here a particular module over a reductive quantum subsuperalgebra Uq (l). Let Uq (l0 ) = Uq (l) \u2229 Uq (g0 ), and denote by Uq (l\u22640 ) the Hopf subsuperalgebra of Uq (l) generated by all the generators of Uq (l) but Em,m+1 . Note that if\n(l )\nUq (l) \u2282 Uq (g0 ), then Uq (l\u22640 ) = Uq (l). Let L\u03bc \u22640 be the irreducible Uq (l\u22640 )-module with\nintegral Uq (l0 ) highest weight \u03bc. Note that the generator Em+1,n of Uq (l\u22640 ) necessarily\n(l )\n(l )\nacts on L\u03bc \u22640 by zero. Furthermore, L\u03bc \u22640 restricts to an irreducible Uq (l0 )-module.\nDefinition 2.1.\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(l )\nK\u03bc(l) := HomUq (l\u22640 ) Uq (l), L\u03bc \u22640 .\n\n(2.3)\n\nThis will be referred to as a dual Kac module over Uq (l). The action of any y \u2208 Uq (l)\n(l)\non \u03b6 \u2208 K\u03bc is given by hy\u03b6, xi = (\u22121)[y]([x]+[\u03b6])h\u03b6, xyi, \u2200x \u2208 Uq (l).\nLet Ker\u01eb\u22640 be the subspace of Uq (l\u22640 ) annihilated by the co-unit \u01eb. It generates\na two-sided ideal J(l) of Uq (l). By using the PBW theorem 2.1 (generalized in the\nobvious way to Uq (l)) we can easily show that\n(l\n\n)\n\nK\u03bc(l) = (Uq (l)/J(l))\u2217 \u2297C(q) L\u03bc \u22640 .\n\n(2.4)\n\nIt again follows from the PBW theorem that Uq (l)/J(l) is finite dimensional. The\nUq (h)-module structure of its dual vector space can be described explicitly. Let \u03a6+\n1 (l)\nbe the set of the odd positive roots of l. Let E be the Uq (h)-module with a basis\n\u2212(\u03b3,\u01eba )\n{v\u03b3 |\u03b3 \u2208 \u03a6+\nv\u03b3 , for all a. The exterior algebra of E forms a\n1 (l)} such that Ka v\u03b3 = q\nUq (h)-module, which we denote by \u039b(l\u22121). Then (Uq (l)/J(l))\u2217 is isomorphic to \u039b(l\u22121).\nTherefore, as a Uq (h)-module (with diagonal action),\n(l )\nK\u03bc(l) \u223c\n= \u039b(l\u22121 ) \u2297C(q) L\u03bc \u22640 .\n(l\n\n(l)\n\n(2.5)\n\n)\n\nNote that when Uq (l) is purely even, K\u03bc = L\u03bc \u22640 .\n3. Quantum homogeneous Super Vector Bundles\nIn this section we introduce quantum homogeneous superspaces and quantum homogeneous supervector bundles in the context of the quantum general linear supergroup.\nLet us begin be considering the Hopf superalgebra of functions on the quantum general\nlinear supergroup.\n3.1. Functions on the quantum general linear supergroup. General references\non Hopf (super)algebra are [13, 14]. A treatment of the classical general linear supergroup similar to what to be presented here is given in [18]. Let Uq (g)\u2217 denote\nthe Z2 -graded dual vector space of Uq (g). It has a natural associative superalgebraic\nstructure induced by the co-superalgebraic structure of Uq (g). Denote the multiplication of Uq (g)\u2217 by m\u25e6 , then hm\u25e6 (f \u2297 g), xi = hf \u2297 g, \u2206(x)i, for all x \u2208 Uq (g). (We\nshall use the notations \u03c6(v) and h\u03c6, xi interchangeably for the image of v \u2208 V under\n\u03c6 \u2208 HomC(q) (V, W ).)\nThere exist two gradation preserving Uq (g)-actions on Uq (g)\u2217 ,\ndL\u0303 : Uq (g) \u2297 Uq (g)\u2217 \u2192 Uq (g)\u2217 ,\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\ndR\u0303 : Uq (g) \u2297 Uq (g) \u2192 Uq (g) ,\n\nx \u2297 f 7\u2192 dL\u0303x (f ),\nx \u2297 f 7\u2192 dR\u0303x (f ),\n\n\f6\n\nR. B. ZHANG\n\ndefined by\nhdL\u0303x (f ), yi = (\u22121)[x][f ]hf, S(x)yi,\nhdR\u0303x (f ), yi = (\u22121)[x] hf, yxi,\n\n\u2200y \u2208 Uq (g).\n\nIt is easy to see that dL\u0303xy = dL\u0303x dL\u0303y , and dR\u0303xy = dR\u0303x dR\u0303y , for all x, y \u2208 Uq (g).\nStraightforward calculations show that each of these actions converts Uq (g)\u2217 into a\n(graded) left Uq (g)-module. Furthermore, with respect to the module structure the\nproduct map of Uq (g)\u2217 is a Uq (g)-module homomorphism and the unit element of\nUq (g)\u2217 is Uq (g)-invariant. Therefore, each of these actions converts Uq (g)\u2217 into a left\nUq (g)-module superalgebra. The fact that the product map in Uq (g)\u2217 is a module homomorphism means that the operators dR\u0303x and dL\u0303x behave as some sort of generalized\nsuper derivations. Indeed, for all f, g \u2208 Uq (g)\u2217 , we have\nX\ndR\u0303x (f g) =\n(\u22121)[x(2) ][f ] dR\u0303x(1) (f )dR\u0303x(2) (g),\n(3.1)\n(x)\n\nwhere we have used the standard Sweedler notation for the co-multiplication of x.\nHowever, for dL\u0303, we have\nX\n\u2032\n(3.2)\ndL\u0303x (f g) =\n(\u22121)[x(2) ][f ] dL\u0303x\u2032(1) (f )dL\u0303x\u2032(2) (g),\n(x)\n\nP\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwith respect to the opposite co-multiplication \u2206\u2032 (x) =\n(x) x(1) \u2297 x(2) of x. The\ntwo actions also super-commute in the sense that dL\u0303x dR\u0303y = (\u22121)[x][y] dR\u0303y dL\u0303x , for all\nx, y \u2208 Uq (g).\nLet Uq (g)\u25e6 := {f \u2208 Uq (g)\u2217 | kernel of f contains a co-finite ideal of Uq (g)} be the\nfinite dual [14] of the quantized universal enveloping algebra Uq (g) of g. Here we remark\nagain that we only consider Z2 -graded subalgebras and (left, right or two-sided) ideals\nof Uq (g) in this paper. We have the following lemma, which is an adaption of a standard\nresult (see, e.g., Lemma 9.1.1 in [14]) on ordinary associative algebras to Uq (g). In fact\nthe result is valid for any associative superalgebra.\nLemma 3.1. For any f \u2208 Uq (g)\u2217 , the following conditions are equivalent:\n(1) f vanishes on a left ideal of Uq (g) of finite co-dimension;\n(2) f vanishes on a right ideal of Uq (g) of finite co-dimension;\n(3) f vanishes on an ideal of Uq (g) of finite co-dimension, thus belongs to Uq (g)\u25e6 ;\n(4) dL\u0303Uq (g) (f ) is finite dimensional;\n(5) d\n\u0010R\u0303Uq (g) (f ) is finite\u0011dimensional;\n(6)\n\ndL\u0303Uq (g) \u2297 dR\u0303Uq (g) (f ) is finite dimensional;\n\n(7) m\u2217 (f ) \u2208 Uq (g)\u2217 \u2297 Uq (g)\u2217 , where m\u2217 : Uq (g)\u2217 \u2192 (Uq (g) \u2297 Uq (g))\u2217 is defined by\nhm\u2217 (f ), x \u2297 yi = hf, xyi for all x, y \u2208 Uq (g).\n\nProof. The proof of Lemma 9.1.1 in [14] can be extended verbatim to superalgebras. \u0003\nTherefore, f belongs to Uq (g)\u25e6 if and only if one of the equivalent conditions are\nsatisfied. The Lemma in particular enables us to impose a Hopf superalgebra structure\non Uq (g)\u25e6 , with multiplication m\u25e6 , co-multiplication \u2206\u25e6 = m\u2217 |Uq (g)\u25e6 , unit being \u01eb, and\nco-unit being the unit 11Uq (g) of Uq (g). The antipode S\u25e6 of Uq (g)\u25e6 is defined by\nhS\u25e6 (f ), xi = hf, S(x)i,\n\n\u2200f \u2208 Uq (g)\u25e6 , x \u2208 Uq (g).\n\n\fQUANTUM SUPERGROUPS AND NON-COMMUTATIVE BUNDLES\n\n7\n\nRecall that the antipode S\u25e6 is invertible since S is. For convenience, we shall drop the\nsubscript \u25e6 from the notations for all the structure maps but the antipode of Uq (g)\u25e6 .\nA Uq (g)-representation \u03c0 in d \u00d7 d-matrices is a superalgebraic map which is homogeneous of degree 0. We write \u03c0(x) = (\u03c0ij (x))di,j=1 for any x \u2208 Uq (g). Define \u03c0ij \u2208 Uq (g)\u2217 ,\ni, j = 1, 2, . . . , d, by\nh\u03c0ij , xi := \u03c0ij (x),\n\n\u2200i, j,\n\nand call them the matrix elements of \u03c0. Since the kernel of any finite dimensional\nrepresentation is an ideal of Uq (g) with finite co-dimension, all the matrix elements\nof the representation belong to Uq (g)\u25e6 . Conversely, Uq (g)\u25e6 is spanned by the matrix\nelements of all the finite dimensional representations of Uq (g). To see this, we only\nneed to consider an arbitrary non-zero element f \u2208 Uq (g)\u25e6 . Let K be a graded co-finite\nideal of Uq (g) contained in the kernel of f . Then U(g)/K forms a left Uq (g)-module\nunder left multiplication,\nUq (g) \u2297 U(g)/K \u2192 U(g)/K,\ny \u2297 (x + K) 7\u2192 yx + K.\nLet {xi + K} be a basis of Uq (g)/K, and denote by fij the matrix elements of\nthe associated P\nrepresentation relative to this basis. Choose ci \u2208 C(q) such that\n11Uq (g) + K = i ci xi + K, where\n11Uq (g) + K is not contained in the kernel of f as\nP\na set since f 6= 0. Then f = i,j ci hf, xj ifji .\n\nDefinition 3.1. Let A(g) be the Z2 -graded subspace of Uq (g)\u25e6 spanned by the matrix\nelements of the Uq (g)-representations furnished by finite dimensional objects of C(g, g).\nLemma 3.2. A(g) is a Hopf sub-superalgebra of Uq (g)\u25e6 .\nProof. The space spanned by the matrix elements of any finite dimensional representation of Uq (g) is a sub co-algebra of Uq (g)\u25e6 . Thus A(g) forms a sub co-algebra of Uq (g)\u25e6 .\nSince C(g, g) is closed under tensor product, A(g) is closed under multiplication. Also,\nif a finite dimensional Uq (g)-module belongs to C(g, g), then so is also its dual. Thus\nA(g) is stable under the antipode of Uq (g)\u25e6 .\n\u0003\n\nRemark 3.1. From the discussion on matrix elements of finite dimensional representations we see that f \u2208 Uq (g)\u25e6 belongs to A(g) if it satisfies either dL\u0303Ka (f ) = q (\u03bc,\u01eba ) f ,\n\u2200a \u2208 I, or dR\u0303Ka (f ) = q (\u03bc,\u01eba ) f , \u2200a \u2208 I, for some \u03bc \u2208 h\u2217Z .\n3.2. Quantum homogeneous super vector bundles. Recall that in classical geometry, a compact manifold can be recovered from its algebra of continuous functions\nby the Gelfand-Naimark theorem. Also, the Serre-Swan theorem establishes a one to\none correspondence between the spaces of the continuous sections of vector bundles\nover a compact manifold and the finite type projective modules of the algebra of continuous functions on the manifold. These results are taken as the starting point for\nnon-commutative geometry [3], where 'manifolds' are replaced by non-commutative\nalgebras, and 'vector bundles' by finitely generated projective modules. The quantum homogeneous superspaces and quantum homogeneous supervector bundles to be\nstudied here are defined in this spirit.\nAs is well known, all holomorphic functions on a compact complex manifold are\nconstants. Therefore, the algebra of holomorphic functions contains little information\nabout the manifold itself. This problem persists in classical supergeometry [10] and also\nquantum geometry [5]. However, as shown in [5] in the context of ordinary quantum\n\n\f8\n\nR. B. ZHANG\n\ngroups, we can get around the problem by working with the quantum analogues of\nsmooth functions in a real setting. To do this, we need some basic notions about\n\u2217-Hopf superalgebras [21, 22].\nA \u2217-superalgebraic structure on an associative superalgebra A over C(q) is a conjugate linear anti-involution \u03b8 : A \u2192 A: for all x, y \u2208 A, c, c\u2032 \u2208 C(q),\n\u03b8(cx + dy) = c\u0304\u03b8(x) + c\u0304\u2032 \u03b8(y),\n\n\u03b8(xy) = \u03b8(y)\u03b8(x),\n\n\u03b82 (x) = x.\n\n(3.3)\n\nHere c\u0304 and c\u0304\u2032 are defined in the following way. Let P be a complex polynomial in\nq. Then P\u0304 is the polynomial obtained by replacing all the coefficients of P by their\ncomplex conjugates. Now if there is another polynomial Q in q such that c = P/Q,\nthen c\u0304 = P\u0304 /Q\u0304.\nRemark 3.2. Note that the second equation in (3.3) does not involve any sign factors\nas one would normally expect of superalgebras.\nWe shall sometimes use the notation (A, \u03b8) for the \u2217-superalgebra A with the \u2217structure \u03b8. Let (B, \u03b81 ) be another associative \u2217-superalgebra. Now A \u2297 B has a\nnatural superalgebra structure, with the multiplication defined for any a, a\u2032 \u2208 A and\nb, b\u2032 \u2208 B by\n\u2032\n\n(a \u2297 b)(a\u2032 \u2297 b\u2032 ) = (\u22121)[b][a ] aa\u2032 \u2297 bb\u2032 .\nFurthermore, the following conjugate linear map\n\u03b8 \u22c6 \u03b81 : a \u2297 b 7\u2192 (1 \u2297 \u03b81 (b))(\u03b8(a) \u2297 1) = (\u22121)[a][b] \u03b8(a) \u2297 \u03b81 (b)\n\n(3.4)\n\ndefines a \u2217-superalgebraic structure on A \u2297 B.\nLet us assume that A is a Hopf superalgebra with co-multiplication \u2206, co-unit \u01eb and\nantipode S. If the \u2217-superalgebraic structure \u03b8 satisfies\n(\u03b8 \u22c6 \u03b8)\u2206 = \u2206\u03b8,\n\n\u03b8\u01eb = \u01eb\u03b8,\n\nthen A is called a Hopf \u2217-superalgebra. Now\n\u03c3 := S\u03b8\nsatisfies \u03c3 2 = idA , as follows from the definition of the antipode.\nLet A0 denote the finite dual of A, which has a natural Hopf superalgebraic structure.\nIf A is a Hopf \u2217-superalgebra with the \u2217-structure \u03b8, then \u03c3 = S\u03b8 induces a map\n\u03c9 : A0 \u2192 A0 defined for any f \u2208 A0 by\nh\u03c9(f ), xi = hf, \u03c3(x)i,\n\n\u2200x \u2208 A.\n\n(3.5)\n\nAs can be easily shown [22], this map \u03c9 gives rise to a Hopf \u2217-superalgebraic structure\non A0 .\nIn the case of Uq (g), the following conjugate anti-involution defines a Hopf \u2217superalgebra structure:\n\u22121\n\u03b8 : Ea,a+1 7\u2192 Ea+1,a Ka Ka+1\n,\n\nEa+1,a \u2192\n7 Ka\u22121 Ka+1 Ea,a+1 ,\nKb\n7 Kb , \u2200b \u2208 I.\n\u2192\n\n\u2200a \u2208 I\u2032 ,\n\nThe classical counter part of this map determines a compact real form of the complex\ngeneral linear supergroup. Let \u03c3 = S\u03b8, and define\nURq (g) := {x \u2208 Uq (g)|\u03c3(x) = x}.\n\n(3.6)\n\n\fQUANTUM SUPERGROUPS AND NON-COMMUTATIVE BUNDLES\n\n9\n\nClearly URq (g) forms an associative superalgebra over R(q), even though it may not\nhave a Hopf superalgebra structure. We shall refer to it as a real form of Uq (g), as\nUq (g) = C(q) \u2297R(q) URq (g).\nNow Uq (g)\u25e6 acquires a Hopf \u2217-superalgebra structure \u03c9 which is induced by \u03c3. It\nis easy to show that the image under \u03c9 of any matrix element of a finite dimensional\nUq (g)-representation with integral weights must again be a matrix element of a Uq (g)representation with the same properties. Thus\nLemma 3.3. A(g) forms a Hopf \u2217-superalgebra.\nTherefore A(g) should be considered as some 'complexification' of the superalgebra\nof functions on a compact form of the quantum general linear supergroup.\nLet us denote by dLx and dRx respectively the restrictions of dL\u0303x and dR\u0303x to A(g).\nThe following definition will be important for the remainder of the paper. Let Uq (l) be\na reductive quantum sub-superalgebra of Uq (g). Set URq (l) := Uq (l) \u2229 URq (g). We now\nconsider the sub-superalgebra of A(g) invariant under the left translation of URq (l).\nDefinition 3.2. Define\n\b\nA(g, l) := f \u2208 A(g) | dLx (f ) = \u01eb(x)f, \u2200x \u2208 URq (l) ,\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere \u01eb is the co-unit of Uq (g).\n\nWe shall show presently that A(g, l) forms a superalgebra. In the philosophy of\nnon-commutative geometry [3], A(g, l) defines some virtue quantum homogeneous superspace.\nIt is useful to compare the situation with classical supergeometry [10]. Let \u039b be a\nfinite dimensional Grassmann algebra. Take a parabolic subgroup P of GL(m|n; \u039b)\nwith Lie superalgebra p = l \u2295 u where u is some nilpotent ideal of p. Let U(m|n)\nbe a compact real form of GL(m|n; \u039b), and set K = P \u2229 U(m|n). Then we have\nthe symmetric superspace U(m|n)/K. The tensor product of \u039b with the classical\nanalogue of A(g, l) should capture the essential information of the complexification of\nthe superalgebra of functions on U(m|n)/K.\nSince C(q) \u2297R(q) URq (l) = Uq (l), we can show that an element f of A(g) belongs to\nA(g, l) if and only if\ndLx (f ) = \u01eb(x)f,\n\n\u2200x \u2208 Uq (l).\n\nAlso, by Remark 3.1, an element g of Uq (g)\u25e6 belongs to A(g) if dLk (f ) = \u01eb(k)f ,\n\u2200k \u2208 Uq (h). Combining these observations, we arrive at the following result.\nLemma 3.4.\nA(g, l) = {f \u2208 Uq (g)\u25e6 | dLx (f ) = \u01eb(x)f, \u2200x \u2208 Uq (l)} .\nUsing the left Uq (g)-module algebra structure of A(g), we immediately show that\nLemma 3.5. The A(g, l) is a sub-superalgebra of A(g).\nProof. Uq (l), being a Hopf sub-superalgebra of Uq (g), satisfies \u2206(Uq (l)) \u2282 Uq (l)\u2297Uq (l).\nIf f, g \u2208 A(g, l), then by (3.2) we have dLx (f g) = \u01eb(x)f g, \u2200x \u2208 Uq (l). Therefore,\nf g \u2208 A(g, l).\n\u0003\nSince A(g, l) is non-commutative, there is a distinction between left and right A(g, l)modules.

Since \u03ba is invertible, \u03ba (S(\u039e)) = \u039e\u2297A(g, l). \u0003\nAs an immediate consequence of the proposition, we obtain the following sufficient\ncondition which renders S(\u039e) projective over A(g, l).\nCorollary 3.1. The S(\u039e) is projective over A(g, l) if there exists a Uq (l)-module \u039e\u22a5\nand a finite dimensional Uq (g)-module V such that \u039e \u2295 \u039e\u22a5 is isomorphic to the restriction of V to a Uq (l)-module.\nIf Uq (g) was an ordinary quantized universal enveloping algebra associated with a\nfinite dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra, it was shown in [5] that S(\u039e) was always\nprojective over A(g, l). Unfortunately this is no longer true for Uq (glm|n ). However, if\nUq (l) is a purely even reductive quantum subalgebra of Uq (g), that is, Uq (l) \u2282 Uq (g0 ),\nthen S(\u039e) is a finitely generated projective A(g, l)-module. More generally, we have\nthe following result.\n(l)\n\nLemma 3.6. If \u03bb \u2208 h\u2217Z is g-dominant, then S(K\u03bb ) is projective over A(g, l), where\n(l)\nK\u03bb is the dual Kac module over Uq (l) defined by (2.3).\n(g\n\n)\n\nProof. To prove this, we let L\u0304\u2212\u03bb\u22640 be the irreducible Uq (g\u22640 )-module with lowest weight\n(g )\n\u2212\u03bb, which is finite dimensional. Let V\u0304\u2212\u03bb = Uq (g) \u2297Uq (g\u22640 ) L\u0304\u2212\u03bb\u22640 . Then V\u0304\u2212\u03bb is a finite\ndimensional Uq (g)-module, which naturally restricts to a Uq (l)-module. Let v\u0304\u2212\u03bb \u2208 V\u0304\u2212\u03bb\nbe a non-zero vector with weight \u2212\u03bb, which generates a Uq (l)-module K\u0304 = Uq (l)v\u0304\u2212\u03bb .\nRegard V\u0304\u2212\u03bb as a Uq (h)-module, we have the decomposition V\u0304\u2212\u03bb = K\u0304 \u2295 K\u0304 \u22a5 . This in fact\nis also a direct sum of Uq (l)-modules as the weights of K\u0304 \u22a5 differ from those of K\u0304 by\n\u2217\nroots not belonging to l. The dual V\u0304\u2212\u03bb\nof V\u0304\u2212\u03bb has a natural Uq (l)-module structure, and\n(l)\n\u2217\ncontains the Uq (l)-submodule K\u0304 = K\u03bb as a direct summand. Therefore Proposition\n3.1 applies to the present situation.\n\u0003\nThe space S(\u039e) has a direct bearing on the representation theory of Uq (g).\nLemma 3.7.\n\n(1) S(\u039e) forms a Uq (g)-module under the action\nUq (g) \u2297 S(\u039e) \u2192 S(\u039e),\n\nx \u2297 \u03b6 7\u2192 (id \u2297 dRx )\u03b6.\n\n(3.12)\n\n(2) for every Uq (l)-module map \u03c6 : \u039e \u2192 \u039e\u2032 , the induced map\nS(\u03c6) = \u03c6 \u2297 id : S(\u039e) \u2192 S(\u039e\u2032 ),\n\n(3.13)\n\nis Uq (g)-equivariant.\nProof. The first part follows from the fact that the twoP\nactions dL and dR of Uq (g) on\nA(g) super-commute. To see the second part, let \u03b6 =\nvi \u2297 fi be in S(\u039e).

B. ZHANG\n\nOf particular interest to us is the case when \u039e is a finite dimensional Uq (p)-module,\nwhere Uq (p) is a parabolic quantum sub-superalgebra of Uq (g) with Uq (l) as its Levi\nfactor. Then S(\u039e) contains the following subspace.\nDefinition 3.4. \u0393(\u039e) := {\u03b6 \u2208 S(\u039e) | (id \u2297 dLx )\u03b6 = (S(x) \u2297 id)\u03b6, \u2200x \u2208 Uq (p)} .\nAgain by using the super-commutativity of the Uq (g)-actions dL and dR on A(g)\nwe can easily show that\nLemma 3.8. \u0393(\u039e) is a Uq (g)-submodule of S(\u039e). Also a Uq (p)-module homomorphism\n\u03c6 : \u039e \u2192 \u039e\u2032 induces a Uq (g)-equivariant map\n\u0393(\u03c6) = \u03c6 \u2297 id : \u0393(\u039e) \u2192 \u0393(\u039e\u2032 ).\n\n(3.14)\n\nLet X(p, l) denote the set of Ea+1,a or Ea,a+1 which are contained in Uq (p) but not\nin Uq (l). If the Uq (p)-module \u039e has the property that every element of X(p, l) acts by\nzero, then in this case the definition of \u0393(\u039e) reduces to\n\u0393(\u039e) = {\u03b6 \u2208 S(\u039e) | (id \u2297 dLx )\u03b6 = 0, \u2200x \u2208 X(p, l)} .\nThus \u0393(\u039e) plays a similar role as the space of holomorphic sections in classical geometry.\nWe shall refer to it as the space of holomorphic sections of the homogeneous supervector\nbundle determined by S(\u039e).\nWe shall promote \u0393 to a covariant functor from the category C(p, l) of the Uq (l)-finite\nmodules over the parabolic subalgebra Uq (p) to the category C(g, g) of locally finite\nUq (g)-modules. The resultant functor is shown to be left exact, and its right derived\nfunctors will be regarded as the Dolbeault cohomology groups of the homogeneous\nsupervector bundle.\n4. Induction Functors\nWe study induction functors and their derived functors in this section. Results will\nbe applied to develop a representation theoretical formulation of a quantum analogue of\nDolbeault cohomology for the quantum homogeneous supervector bundles. References\nfor background material on this section are [4] and [8]. The elementary facts from\nhomological algebra used here can be found in any text book, e.g., [19].\n4.1. Categories of modules. We start with a discussion on module categories of\nUq (g) and its quantum sub-superalgebras which will be used later.\nFor any quantum superalgebra U, we shall assume that every U-module to be considered in this paper is Z2 -graded. Thus corresponding to each U-module V , there\nexists another module \u2118V which is equal to V as a set, but with (\u2118V )0\u0304 = V1\u0304 , and\n(\u2118V )1\u0304 = V0\u0304 . Let \u2118(v) denote the element of \u2118V corresponding to v \u2208 V . The action\nof U on \u2118V is defined by x\u2118(v) = (\u22121)[x] \u2118(xv), for all x \u2208 U.\nLet Uq (r) be a quantum sub-superalgebra of Uq (g). Denote by Cinh (r) the category of\nUq (r)-modules, where the space HomU (V, W ) of morphisms between any two U-modules\nV and W is a Z2 -graded subspace of HomC(q) (V, W ) consisting of such elements \u03c6 that\nfor all x \u2208 Uq (r) and v \u2208 V , \u03c6(xv) = (\u22121)[x][\u03c6]x\u03c6(v). The parity change map \u2118 is odd,\nand becomes a covariant functor on Cinh (r) if for any \u03c6 \u2208 HomUq (r) (V, W ) we define\n\u2118(\u03c6) \u2208 HomUq (r) (\u2118V, \u2118W ) to be the same as \u03c6 on sets. Note that if \u03c6 \u2208 HomUq (r) (V, W )\nis an inhomogeneous morphism between objects V and W in Cinh (r), the kernel and\nimage of \u03c6 are not necessarily Z2 -graded in general, thus Cinh (r) is not an Abelian\ncategory.\n\n\fQUANTUM SUPERGROUPS AND NON-COMMUTATIVE BUNDLES\n\n13\n\nAssume Uq (r) contains a reductive sub-superalgebra Uq (k) of Uq (g). Every Uq (r)module V naturally restricts to a Uq (k)-module.\nDefinition 4.1. The Uq (k)-finite subspace V [Uq (k)] of V is defined to be the C(q)-span\nof the integral weight vectors v \u2208 V satisfying dim(Uq (k)v) < \u221e.\nHere Uq (k)v := {xv | x \u2208 Uq (k)}. Elements of V [Uq (k)] will be called Uq (k)-finite.\nAlso, a Uq (r)-module V is called Uq (k)-finite if V = V [Uq (k)].\nRemark 4.1. If V is a Z2 -graded Uq (k)-finite Uq (r)-module and \u03c6 \u2208 HomUq (r) (V, W ) a\nhomogeneous morphism, then \u03c6(V ) is a Z2 -graded Uq (k)-finite Uq (r)-submodule of W .\nLet Uq (q) be either a parabolic or reductive quantum sub-superalgebra of Uq (g).\nIf Uq (q) contains the reductive quantum sub-superalgebra Uq (k), we shall talk about\nthe pair (Uq (q), Uq (k)) of quantum sub-superalgebras. Two pairs of sub-superalgebras\n(Uq (q), Uq (k)) and (Uq (p), Uq (l)) are said to be compatible if we have the Hopf superalgebra inclusions Uq (q) \u2287 Uq (p) and Uq (k) \u2287 Uq (l), and in this case, we write\n(Uq (q), Uq (k)) \u2287 (Uq (p), Uq (l)). Given a pair (Uq (q), Uq (k)), we shall denote by\nCinh (q, k) the full subcategory of Cinh (q) with the Uq (k)-finite Uq (q)-modules as its\nobjects. Clearly, Cinh (q, k) is closed under passage to graded sub-modules, graded quotients and finite direct sums. It is also closed under finite tensor products.\nDefinition 4.2. Let C(q) be the subcategory of Cint (q) consisting of the same objects\nand the even morphisms of Cinh (q). Let C(q, k) be the full subcategory of C(q) with the\nUq (k)-finite objects.\nThen C(q) is obviously an Abelian category, and it follows from Remark 4.1 that\nC(q, k) is also Abelian.\n4.2. Induction functors. Let (Uq (p), Uq (l)) be a pair of quantum sub-superalgebras\nof Uq (g), where Uq (p) is either a parabolic or reductive quantum sub-superalgebra of\nUq (g), and Uq (l) is a reductive quantum sub-superalgebra of Uq (g) contained in Uq (p).\nWe recall that all the objects of the categories C(p) and C(p, l) are Z2 -graded, and all\nthe morphisms of the categories are even.\nDefinition 4.3. Define a covariant functor Zpp,l : C(p) \u2192 C(p, l) in the following way:\nfor any object V , Zpp,l(V ) is the (not necessarily direct ) sum of the Uq (l)-finite Z2 -graded\nUq (p)-submodules of V , and for any morphism \u03c6 \u2208 HomC(p) (V, W ), Zpp,l(\u03c6) = \u03c6|Zpp,l (V ) .\nZpp,l is well defined because of Remark 4.1. When Uq (p) = Uq (l)) = Uq (g), we have\nan analogue of the Zuckerman functor.\nLemma 4.1. The functor Zpp,l : C(p) \u2192 C(p, l) is left exact.\nProof. Even though the proof is straightforward, we nevertheless give the details here\nbecause of the importance of the functor Zpp,l. Let us temporarily use Z to denote Zpp,l.\nGiven any exact sequence\nj\ni\n0 \u2212\u2192 U \u2212\u2192 V \u2212\u2192 W\nin C(p), we want to show that the following sequence in C(p, l) is also exact:\nZ(i)\n\nZ(j)\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 Z(U) \u2212\u2192 Z(V ) \u2212\u2192 Z(W ).\nAssume U \u2032 is a Uq (l)-finite Uq (p)-submodule of U. Then i(U \u2032 ) is a Uq (l)-finite Uq (p)submodule of V . Thus the injectivity of i implies the injectivity of Z(i).\n\n\f14\n\nR. B. ZHANG\n\nLet V \u2032 be a Uq (p)-submodule of Z(V ). If an element v \u2208 V \u2032 is in KerZ(j), then there\nexists a unique u \u2208 U such that v = i(u). Now Uq (p)v = i (Uq (p)u) is a Uq (l)-finite\nUq (p)-submodule of V . The injectivity of i forces Uq (p)u to be a Uq (p)-submodule of\nZ(U). In particular, u \u2208 Z(U). Thus ImZ(i) \u2287 KerZ(j). But it is obvious that\nImZ(i) \u2286 KerZ(j). Hence the sequence is also exact at Z(V ).\n\u0003\nLet Uq (q) either be a parabolic or reductive quantum sub-superalgebra of Uq (g),\nand let (Uq (p), Uq (l)) be as given above with Uq (q) \u2287 Uq (p). We define the covariant\nq\nfunctor Ip,l\n: C(p, l) \u2192 C(q) by\nIqp,l(V ) := HomUq (p) (Uq (q), V ),\n\nIqp,l(\u03c6) := HomUq (p) (Uq (q), \u03c6)\n\n(4.1)\n\nfor any object V and morphism \u03c6 \u2208 HomC(p,l) (V, W ).

The functor Ip,l\nis the\n\u2217\ncomposition of the exact functor of tensoring with Uq (q) and the left exact functor of\ntaking Uq (p) invariant submodules, thus is also left exact.\n\nDefinition 4.4. Given compatible pairs (Uq (q), Uq (k)) \u2287 (Uq (p), Uq (l)), we introduce\nthe covariant functor\nq\nq,k\nIq,k\np,l := Zq \u25e6 Ip,l : C(p, l) \u2192 C(q, k),\n\nand call it the induction functor from C(p, l) to C(q, k).\nLemma 4.2. The induction functor Iq,k\np,l is left exact.\nProof. Since both Iqp,l and Zqq,k are left exact, their composition must also be left exact.\n\u0003\nLet us examine some further properties of the Zuckerman functor and the induction\nfunctor.\nLet Uq (q) be either a parabolic or reductive quantum sub-superalgebra of Uq (g), and\nlet Uq (k) be a reductive quantum sub-superalgebra of Uq (g). Assume Uq (q) \u2283 Uq (k).\nThen for any object W of C(q),\nZqq,k(W ) = W [Uq (k)].\n\n(4.3)\n\nTo prove this, we define the adjoint action of Uq (q) on itself\nX\nady (x) =\n(\u22121)[y(2) ][x] y(1) xS(y(2) ), x, y \u2208 Uq (q),\n(y)\n\nP\nwhere Sweedler's notation \u2206(y) = (y) y(1) \u2297 y(2) is used for the co-multiplication of\ny. By using the Poincar\u00e9-Birkhoff-Witt (PBW) Theorem 2.1, we can choose a set of\nyi each of which is a product of Eab associated with the roots of q not contained\nin k,\nP\nsuch that every element x \u2208 Uq (q) can be expressed as a finite sum x =\nyi ui with\nui \u2208 Uq (k). By considering the PBW theorem again, we see that there exists a finite\nset Yx of the yi such that every element of the space adUq (k) (x) := {adu (x) | u \u2208 Uq (k)}\n\n\fQUANTUM SUPERGROUPS AND NON-COMMUTATIVE BUNDLES\n\n15\n\nP \u2032\ncan be expressed in the form\nyi ui with yi \u2208 Yx and u\u2032i \u2208 Uq (k).

Therefore,\n\ndim (Uq (k)(xw)) \u2264 |Yx | dim (Uq (k)w) < \u221e,\nwhere Yx is the cardinality of Yx . Also, if x carries a fixed weight and w is a weight\nvector of W [Uq (k)], then xw is a weight vector of W [Uq (k)] with integral weight. Hence\nW [Uq (k)] is indeed a Uq (q)-submodule of W .\nLemma 4.3.

To prove that the Lemma holds on objects, we need the following technical\nresult which will be proved below: if (Uq (r), Uq (j)) \u2287 (Uq (q), Uq (k)), then for any object\nW of C(q),\n\u0001\nZrr,j \u25e6 HomUq (q) (Uq (r), W ) = Zrr,j \u25e6 HomUq (q) Uq (r), Zqq,k(W ) .\n(4.4)\n\nWith (4.4) granted, we have for any object V of C(p, l) that\n\u0010\n\u0011\nq,k\nq,k\nr,j\nIr,j\n\u25e6\nI\n(V\n)\n=\nZ\n\u25e6\nHom\nU\n(r),\nI\n(V\n)\nq\nUq (q)\nr\nq,k\np,l\np,l\n\n\u0001\n= Zrr,j \u25e6 HomUq (q) Uq (r), HomUq (p) (Uq (q), V ) .\n\nThe far right hand side of the equation can be simplified by using the following relation\n\u0001\n\u0001\nHomUq (q) Uq (r), HomUq (p) (Uq (q), V ) = HomUq (p) Uq (q) \u2297Uq (q) Uq (r), V\n= HomUq (p) (Uq (r), V ) ,\nand we arrive at\nq,k\nr,j\nr,j\nIr,j\nq,k \u25e6 Ip,l (V ) = Zr \u25e6 HomUq (p) (Uq (r), V ) = Ip,l(V ).\n\nNow we turn to the proof of equation (4.4), which is equivalent to the statement\nthat for any \u03b6 \u2208 Zrr,j \u25e6 HomUq (q) (Uq (r), W ),\nh\u03b6, zi \u2208 Zqq,k(W ),\n\n\u2200z \u2208 Uq (r).\n\n(4.5)\n\nBy the PBW theorem for Uq (r), there exists a set of xi , each of which is a product of\nelements associated with roots\nP of r not contained in q, such that every z \u2208 Uq (r) can\nbe expressed as a finite sum\nyi xi with yi \u2208 Uq (q). Let \u03bdi be the weight of xi , which\nis a sum of roots of r thus is integral. We have\nX\n(\u22121)[\u03b6][u(2) ] \u03c0W (u(1) )h\u03b6, adS(u(2) ) (xi )i, u \u2208 Uq (k),\nhu \u25e6 \u03b6, xi i =\n(u)\n\nwhere u \u25e6 \u03b6 is as defined by (4.2), and \u03c0W refers to the Uq (q) action on W . From this\nequation we can deduce that\nX\n\u03c0W (u)h\u03b6, xi i =\n(\u22121)[u(2) ][\u03b6]hu(1) \u25e6 \u03b6, adu(2) (xi )i, u \u2208 Uq (k).\n(u)\n\n\f16\n\nR. B.

Now h\u03b6, xj uj i =\nhuj \u25e6 \u03b6, xj i, and\n\u03b6 \u2208 Zrr,j \u25e6 HomUq (q) (Uq (r), W ) implies that the span of u \u25e6 \u03b6 for all u \u2208 Uq (k) is finite\ndimensional. Therefore,\ndim (\u03c0W (Uq (k))h\u03b6, xi i) < \u221e, that is, h\u03b6, xi i \u2208 Zqq,k(W ), \u2200i.\nP\nSince Zqq,k(W ) is Uq (q)-stable, we haveP i \u03c0W (Uq (q))h\u03b6, xi i \u2282 Zqq,k(W ). Now every\nelement of Uq (r) can be expressed P\nas\nyi xi withPyi \u2208 Uq (q). By the definition of\nr,j\nZr \u25e6 HomUq (q) (Uq (r), W ), we have h\u03b6, yi xi i = (\u22121)[yi ][\u03b6] \u03c0W (yi )h\u03b6, xi i, where the\nright hand side has just been shown to belong to Zqq,k(W ).

The theorem plays a crucial role in\nthe study of derived functors of the induction functors.\n\nTheorem 4.1. There exists the natural even isomorphism\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u223c\np,l\nHomUq (q) W, Iq,k\n(V\n)\n\u2212\u2192\nHom\nF\n(W\n),\nV\n,\nU\n(p)\nq\np,l\nq,k\n\u03c6\n\n7\u2192\n\n\u03c6(11Uq (q) ),\n\n(4.6)\n\nof Z2 -graded vector spaces for all W in C(q, k) and V in C(p, l).\nProof. Since W is an object of C(q, k), the\nvector of W under an arbitrary\n\u0001 image of any\nq,k\n\u03c6 \u2208 HomUq (q) W, HomUq (p) (Uq (q), V ) belongs to Ip,l (V ). From this we can easily\ndeduce that\n\u0001\n\u223c\nHomUq (q) (W, Iq,k\np,l (V )) = HomUq (q) W, HomUq (p) (Uq (q), V ) .\n\u0001\nThe right hand side can be further rewritten\nas HomU\u0011q (p) Uq (q) \u2297Uq (q) W, V . Now\n\u0010\n\u0001\np,l\nHomUq (p) Uq (q) \u2297Uq (q) W, V \u223c\n= HomUq (p) Fq,k(W ), V . Thus\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nq,k\np,l\n\u223c\nHomUq (q) W, Ip,l (V ) = HomUq (p) Fq,k(W ), V .\n(4.7)\nThis establishes the claimed isomorphism between the vector spaces. Let us now show\nthat \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6(11Uq (q) ), \u03c6 \u2208 HomUq (q) (W, Iq,k\np,l (V )), is indeed the required map. The\n\u03c6(11Uq (q) ) (We shall write 1 for the identity 11Uq (q) of Uq (q).) is the evaluation of \u03c6\nat the identity of Uq (q). Denote by \u25e6 the action of Uq (q) on Iq,k\np,l (V ). Then for any\nx \u2208 Uq (q) and w \u2208 W , we have\n\u03c6(1)(xw) = (\u22121)[x][\u03c6] (x \u25e6 \u03c6)(1)(w) = \u03c6(x)(w),\nwhere the symbol \u25e6 refers to the Uq (q)-action on Iq,k\np,l (V ). If \u03c6 belongs to the kernel of\nthe map (4.6), then \u03c6(x) = 0, \u2200x \u2208 Uq (q). This forces \u03c6 = 0. Thus the map (4.6) is\ninjective, and because of the isomorphism (4.7), it must be a bijection.\np,l\nWe still need to show that \u03c6(1) \u2208 HomUq (p) (Fq,k\n(W ), V ). But this is clear, as the\nq,k\ndefining property of Ip,l (V ) implies\n\u03c6(x)(w) = (\u22121)[x][\u03c6]x (\u03c6(1)(w)) ,\nThis completes the proof.\n\n\u2200x \u2208 Uq (p).\n\u0003\n\n\fQUANTUM SUPERGROUPS AND NON-COMMUTATIVE BUNDLES\n\n17\n\nThe following result is an immediate consequence of Theorem 4.1.\nCorollary 4.1. The induction functor Iq,k\np,l takes injectives to injectives.\nProof. If V is an injective object in C(p, l), then HomUq (p) ( * , V ) is an exact functor\nfrom C(p, l) to the category of Z2\u0010-graded vector\n\u0011 spaces. Thus by the Frobenius reciq,k\nprocity of Theorem 4.1, HomUq (q) * , Ip,l (V ) is exact on C(q, k). This in turn implies\nthat Iq,k\np,l (V ) is injective in C(q, k).\n\n\u0003\n\nConsider the pair (Uq (p), Uq (l)) of quantum sub-superalgebras of Uq (g), where Uq (l)\nis assumed to be reductive as always.\nCorollary 4.2. The category C(p, l) has enough injectives.\nProof. Let Uq (l0 ) = Uq (l)\u2229Uq (g0 ). Every Uq (l0 )-finite Uq (p)-module is also Uq (l)-finite\nand vice versa, hence the categories C(p, l0 ) and C(p, l) are identical. Since Uq (l0 ) is\nthe tensor product of some non-super Uq (glk )'s, every object of C(l0 , l0 ) is semi-simple,\nthus is injective. Let V be an Uq (l)-finite Uq (p)-module, which can be restricted to an\nobject of C(l0 , l0 ). Now Ip,l\nl0 ,l0 (V ) is injective as follows from the above Corollary. By\nTheorem 4.1 we have the isomorphism\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u223c\nF : HomUq (p) V, Ip,l\n(V\n)\n\u2212\u2192 HomUq (l0 ) (V, V ) .\nl0 ,l0\nConsider the pre-image of the identity map idV \u2208 HomUq (l0 ) (V, V ) under F ,\n\u03b9 := F \u22121 (idV ) : V \u2192 Ip,l\nl0 ,l0 (V ),\n\nv 7\u2192 \u03b9v ,\n\nwhich is an injective Uq (p)-map. It satisfies \u03b9v (x) = (\u22121)[x][v] xv, \u2200x \u2208 Uq (p).\n\n(4.8)\n\u0003\n\nRemark 4.2. The Iq,k\np,l can be extended to a covariant functor Cinh (q, k) \u2192 Cinh (p, l) in\nthe obvious way. It also takes injectives to injectives. By using Frobenius reciprocity,\nwe can also show that the category Cinh (p, l) has enough injectives.\nNow we restrict our attention to the induction functor Ig,g\np,l : C(p, l) \u2192 C(g, g). Since\ng,g\nthe Abelian category C(p, l) has enough injectives, and Ip,l is left exact, it makes sense\n\u0001k\n, k \u2208 Z+ . We now give a conto talk about its right derived functors [19] Ig,g\np,l\n\u0001\nk\n. Let V be any object of C(p, l). Then its restriction to a\ncrete description of Ig,g\np,l\nUq (l0 )-module lies in C(l0 , l0 ) and thus is injective. We construct the following injective\nresolution of V in C(p, l),\n\u03b40\n\n\u03b9\n\n\u03b41\n\n\u03b42\n\n0\u2192V \u2212\u2192 I 0 (V ) \u2212\u2192 I 1 (V ) \u2212\u2192 I 2 (V ) \u2212\u2192 * * *\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere the Uq (p)-modules and maps are defined inductively by\nk\nk\u22121 k\u22121\nI k+1 (V ) := Ip,l\n(I (V ))),\nl0 ,l0 (I (V )/\u03b4\np\n\n\u03b9\n\n\u03b4 k := \u03b9 \u25e6 p : I k (V ) \u2192 I k (V )/\u03b4 k\u22121(I k\u22121 (V )) \u2192 I k+1 (V ).\n\n(4.10)\n\nHere \u03b9 is similarly defined as in (4.8), p is the canonical projection, and\nI 0 (V ) = Ip,l\nl0 ,l0 (V ),\n\n\u03b4 \u22121 = \u03b9.\n\nThe sequence (4.9) is clearly a resolution, with all I k (V ) being injective because of\nCorollary 4.1.

Quantum Bott-Borel-Weil Theorem\nThroughout this section, we shall assume that (Uq (p), Uq (l)) is a pair of quantum subsuperalgebras such that Uq (l) is a reductive quantum sub-superalgebra of Uq (g), and\nUq (p) is the parabolic with Uq (l) being its Levi factor. For the sake of concreteness, we\nalso assume that Uq (p) contains the lower triangular Borel subalgebra Uq (b\u0304) of Uq (g).\nWe shall also denote Uq (p0 ) = Uq (g0 ) \u2229 Uq (p0 ).\nThe main results of the section are Theorems 5.2 and 5.3, which might be considered\nas a form of Bott-Borel-Weil theorem for the quantum general linear supergroup.\n5.1. Dolbeault cohomology groups. We first formulate the Dolbeault cohomology\ngroups of the homogeneous supervector bundles as the derived functor of an induction\nfunctor. First note that the domain of S can be extended to the category C(l, l), and\nthat of \u0393 to the category C(p, l). Below we shall consider these more generally defined\nS and \u0393. We have the following result.\nTheorem 5.1. S coincides with Ig,g\nl,l on C(l, l).\nProof. By examining the second part of Proposition 3.1, we easily see that S agrees\ng,g\nwith Ig,g\nl,l on maps. Let \u039e be an object of C(l, l). The inclusion S(\u039e) \u2286 Il,l (\u039e) is obvious\nsince \u039e \u2297 A(g) is Uq (g)-finite with respect to the\nelement\nP action id\u039e \u2297 dRUq (g) . Any\n\u2217\n\u03b6 \u2208 HomUq (l) (Uq (g), \u039e) can be expressed as \u03b6 = \u03bei \u2297fi , where fi \u2208 Uq (g) and \u03b6i \u2208 \u039e.\nThe \u03b6 belongs to Ig,g\nl,l (\u039e) only if dim(RUq (g) (fi )) < \u221e, \u2200i. This is equivalent to the\ncondition that all the fi belong to Uq (g)\u25e6 , as follows from Lemma 3.1. Since \u039e regarded\nas a Uq (h)-module is integral, we may assume that the \u03bei are weight vectors with integral\nweights. The defining property of Ig,g\nl,l (\u039e) requires the fi be dLUq (h) eigenvectors in\n\u25e6\nUq (g) with integral weights. Hence by Remark 3.1, the fi must all belong to A(g). \u0003\nIn exactly the same manner we can show that\nCorollary 5.1. \u0393(\u039e) = Ig,g\np,l (\u039e) on C(p, l).\nRemark 5.1. In view of the Theorem and this Corollary, we regard the right derived\nfunctors of Ig,g\np,l as a form of Dolbeault cohomology of the quantum homogeneous super\nvector bundles. Thus we shall use the more suggestive notation H 0,k (G/P, S(\u039e)) to\ndenote H k (\u03a9(p, l; \u039e)).\n\n\fQUANTUM SUPERGROUPS AND NON-COMMUTATIVE BUNDLES\n\n19\n\n5.2.

The first relation can be confirmed by directly checking the functors involved on\ng\u22640 ,g0\nobjects and morphisms. For any object V of C(g\u22640 , l), Ig\u22640\n,l (V ) = V [Uq (g0 )], and thus\ng\n\n,g\n\ng0 ,g0\ng0 ,l\n\u22640 0\n0 ,g0\nFgg\u22640\n,g0 \u25e6 Ig\u22640 ,l (V ) is V [Uq (g0 )] regarded as a Uq (g0 )-module. Also, Ig0 ,l \u25e6 Fg\u22640 ,l(V ) =\n0 ,l\nFgg\u22640\n,l(V )[Uq (g0 )], which is again V [Uq (g0 )] regarded as a Uq (g0 )-module.

B. ZHANG\n\nWe also have the following easy result.\nLemma 5.2. The functor Ig,g\ng\u22640 ,g0 : C(g\u22640 , g0 ) \u2192 C(g, g) is exact with\nIg,g\ng\u22640 ,g0 (V ) = HomUq (g\u22640 ) (Uq (g), V ) ,\nfor any object V in C(g\u22640 , g0 ).\nProof. We need to show that HomUq (g\u22640 ) (Uq (g), * ) is exact on C(g\u22640 , g0 ), and for any\nV in C(g\u22640 , g0 ), HomUq (g\u22640 ) (Uq (g), V ) is Uq (g0 )-finite. It is fairly easy to see that\nHomUq (g\u22640 ) (Uq (g), V ) is spanned by integral weigh vectors since V is an object of\nC(g\u22640 , g0 ). Let U +1 denote the subspace of Uq (g) spanned by the ordered products of\n(Ei\u03b1 )\u03b8i\u03b1 , i \u2264 m < \u03b1, \u03b8i\u03b1 = 0, 1. Clearly dim U +1 = 2mn . Then\n\u0001\u2217\nHomU (g ) (Uq (g), V ) \u223c\n= U +1 \u2297 V.\nq\n\n\u22640\n\nThis in particular implies that HomUq (g\u22640 ) (Uq (g), * ) is exact. Given any x \u2208 Uq (g0 )\nP\nand P\n\u03b7 \u2208 U +1 , there exist \u03b7j \u2208 U +1 and xj \u2208 Uq (g0 ) such that \u03b7x =\nxj \u03b7j . Let\n+1 \u2217\n\u03b6 = fi \u2297 vi be in (U ) \u2297 V.

This completes the proof.\n\u0003\nThe following proposition is one of the main results of this paper.\n\nProposition 5.1.

Suppose C \u2032 \u2212\u2192 C \u2032\u2032 is an exact covariant functor. Then F \u25e6 G is left exact,\nF\nand its right derive functors are (F \u25e6 G)k = F \u25e6 (G)k . (b). Suppose C \u0303 \u2212\u2192 C \u2032 is an\nexact covariant functor. Then G \u25e6 F is left exact, and its right derived functors are\n(G \u25e6 F )k = (G)k \u25e6 F . Applying these results to the situation at hand, we arrive at\n\u0001k (p )\ng\u22640 ,g0 \u0001k\n(p)\n0 ,g0\n(L\u03bb ) = Ipg00 ,l,g0 (L\u03bb 0 ).\nFgg\u22640\n,g0 \u25e6 Ip,l\n\u0001k\nThe derived functor Ipg00 ,l,g0 on the right hand side can be computed by using the quan\u0001k (p )\ntum Bott-Borel-Weil theorem [1] for Uq (g0 ) = Uq (glm ) \u2297 Uq (gln ).

Therefore, its inverse\n0 ,g0\nimage under the forgetful functor Fgg\u22640\n,g0 must be either zero or Uq (g\u22640 )-irreducible.\nIn both cases, Em+1,m acts by zero. Thus by using Lemma 5.2, we have\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0001\n\u0001k (p)\n(p0 )\ng0 ,g0 k\ng,g\n(L\n)\n,\nI\n(L\n)\n=\nI\nIg,g\ng\u22640 ,g0\n\u03bb\np0 ,l\n\u03bb\np,l\n\u0001k (p )\nwhere Igp00 ,l,g0 (L\u03bb 0 ) is regarded as a Uq (g\u22640 )-module with Em+1,m acting by zero.\nAnother easy application of Lemma 5.2 completes the proof.\n\u0003\nBy using the proposition we can easily prove the following result.\nTheorem 5.2. Let Uq (l) \u2286 Uq (g0 ) be a reductive quantum subalgebra of Uq (g). Let\nUq (p) \u2287 Uq (b\u0304) be the parabolic quantum sub-superalgebra of Uq (g) with Uq (l) as its\n(p)\nLevi factor. Let L\u03bb be a finite dimensional irreducible Uq (p)-module with Uq (l)-highest\nweight \u03bb \u2208 h\u2217Z .\n(1) If \u03bb is g-regular, then there exists a unique element w of the Weyl group of g0\nrendering \u03bc := w(\u03bb + \u03c1) \u2212 \u03c1 dominant with respect to g. In this case,\n\u001a (g)\n(p)\nK\u03bc , k = |w|,\n0,k\nH (G/P, S(L\u03bb )) =\n0,\nk 6= |w|,\nwhere |w| denotes the length of w.\n(2) If \u03bb is not g-regular, then\n(p)\n\nH 0,k (G/P, S(L\u03bb )) = 0,\n\n\u2200k.\n\nProof. According to the quantum Bott-Borel-Weil theorem for quantized universal en\u0001k (p )\nveloping algebras of ordinary Lie algebras [1], the Igp00 ,l,g0 (L\u03bb 0 ) vanishes for all k if \u03bb\n\u0001\n(p )\n0 k\n(L\u03bb 0 ) is concentrated at on degree,\nis not g0 -regular. If \u03bb is g0 -regular, then Igp00 ,g\n,l\n\u0001\n(p )\n0 k\n(L\u03bb 0 ) is non-vanishing for one k only. We have\nnamely, Igp00 ,g\n,l\n\u0001|w| (p0 )\n0)\n(L\u03bb ) = L(g\nIpg00 ,l,g0\n\u03bc ,\n(g )\n\nwhere L\u03bb 0 is the irreducible Uq (g0 )-module with highest weight \u03bc. Using this result\nin Proposition 5.1, we arrive at the Theorem.\n\u0003\n\nRemark 5.2. An easy examination will show that\n\u0001 the proof for Proposition 5.1 still goes\nthrough for Uq glm1 |n1 \u2295 glm2 |n2 \u2295 ... \u2295 glmi |ni for any finite i. The same comment\napplies to Theorem 5.2.\n5.2.2. The general case. We investigate the general case in this subsection. Now Uq (l)\nis an arbitrary reductive quantum sub-superalgebra of Uq (g), and Uq (p) is the parabolic\ncontaining Uq (b\u0304) and has the Levi factor Uq (l). Let Uq (b\u0304l) = Uq (b\u0304) \u2229 Uq (l) be the Borel\nsubalgebra of Uq (l).
