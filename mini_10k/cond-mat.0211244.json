The necessity to invoke this additional parameter reflects the overcompleteness of the set\nb (in fact of any interof single-particle excitations of H\nacting Hamiltonian) in regard to the underlying singleparticle Hilbert space [25]. In what follows we employ\ns = 0 to represent GSs, for example as in |\u03a8M;0 i, the\nb\nM -particle GS of H.\nWe demonstrate that insofar as a limited number of\ncharacteristics of the interacting system are concerned,\nG\u03c3 (k; \u03b5) is equivalent with the exact single-particle Green\nfunction G\u03c3 (k; \u03b5). The most relevant of the latter characteristics are\n\n\u00a7 1. Introduction\n\nThe unconventional behaviour of the normal states of\nthe doped copper-oxide-based high-temperature superconducting compounds (hereafter referred to as cuprates)\n[1,2] has necessitated reconsideration of the conventional\ntheory of metals [3,4]. The latter relies on the fundamental premise that in these the low-lying single-particle excitations are analogous to those of non-interacting metallic systems and that the electron-electron interaction\nmerely gives rise to finite renormalization of the lowenergy or low-temperature response and transport properties of the corresponding non-interacting systems. For\nthe last approximately four decades, this perspective,\nwhich constitutes the phenomenological theory of Landau [5], has a formal basis on the foundation of the theory of many-particle systems, which provides the recipe\nfor the calculation of the phenomenological parameters of\nthe Landau theory in terms of some material-specific parameters (such as the concentration of the carriers) and\nthe fundamental constants of nature [6,7].\nIt is generally considered that the single-band Hubb for fermions [8\u201313] confined to a\nbard Hamiltonian H\nplanar square lattice captures the most significant aspects of the electronic correlation in the layered cuprate\ncompounds [14,15,3] (for a review see [16]). In this work\nwe expose some exact properties concerning the uniform\nground states (GSs) and the corresponding low-lying\nsingle-particle excitations of this Hamiltonian for arbitrary spatial dimensions d. We derive some novel expressions for n\u03c3 (k) corresponding to k in the close neighbourb\nhood of Sf;\u03c3 for any conceivable uniform metallic GS of H\nin terms\ndeducible from\nR \u03bc of some constrained parameters\nR\u03bc\n\u03b5k , \u2212\u221e d\u03b5 A\u03c3 (k; \u03b5) \u2261 h\u0304n\u03c3 (k) and \u2212\u221e d\u03b5 \u03b5 A\u03c3 (k; \u03b5) for\nk \u2192 Sf;\u03c3 , where A\u03c3 (k; \u03b5) stands for the single-particle\nspectral function of the interacting system and \u03bc for the\n'chemical potential' (see later). Evidently, since n\u03c3 (k)\nitself underlies our expressions for n\u03c3 (k) corresponding\nto k \u2192 Sf;\u03c3 , these expressions are implicit functions of\nn\u03c3 (k) for k \u2192 Sf;\u03c3 , implying a closer interdependence of\nthe parameters determining the behaviour of n\u03c3 (k) for\nk \u2192 Sf;\u03c3 than is strictly relevant for our specific considerations in this work. The latter interdependence may\nbe fruitfully incorporated in the design of the theoretical\nschemes that are aimed to the quantitative calculation of\nn\u03c3 (k) and other correlation functions pertaining to unib [17].\nform metallic GSs of H\nOn the basis of the above-mentioned expressions\nfor n\u03c3 (k), from an available numerical result (obtained within the framework of the fluctuation-exchange\n(FLEX) approximation) concerning n\u03c3 (k) corresponding\nto the Hubbard Hamiltonian in d = 2, with U/t = 8\nand n\u03c3 = n\u03c3\u0304 = 0.265 [18], we establish that the underlying metallic state cannot be a Fermi-liquid (FL). Here\nn\u03c3 stands for the number of fermions with spin index \u03c3\n\n(i) the GS energy EN ;0 ,\n(ii) the Fermi energy \u03b5f ,\n(iii) the Fermi surface Sf;\u03c3 and\n(iv) the GS momentum distribution function n\u03c3 (k).\nOn account of these and the relative simplicity of the\nanalytic structure of G\u03c3 (k; \u03b5), we deduce a number of\nsignificant facts concerning the GS and the low-lying\nsingle-particle excitations of the uniform metallic GSs\nb We deduce for instance that the Fermi surface\nof H.\nSf;\u03c3 , \u2200\u03c3, pertaining to one such state is a subset (not\n(0)\nnecessarily a proper subset) of the Fermi surface Sf;\u03c3 ,\n\n1\n\nWe should point out that the strong-coupling limit of the\nHubbard Hamiltonian involves in addition to the t-J Hamiltonian a three-site term, proportional to t2 /U . In identifying the t-J Hamiltonian with the strong-coupling limit of the\nHubbard Hamiltonian, one therefore discards the latter term,\na practice which has no a priori justification away from halffilling. See [16] and [23].\n\n2\n\n\fwhere \u0109\u2020i;\u03c3 , \u0109i;\u03c3 are canonical creation and annihilation\noperators respectively for fermions with spin index \u03c3 at\nsite i corresponding to site vector Ri , n\u0302i;\u03c3 :=\u0109\u2020i;\u03c3 \u0109i;\u03c3 is a\npartial site number operator, U the on-site interaction\nenergy (in this work assumed to be positive) and\n\n\u2200\u03c3, that is that determined by the non-interacting energy dispersion \u03b5k and the number N\u03c3 of particles with\nspin index \u03c3 corresponding to the interacting (N\u03c3 + N\u03c3\u0304 )b leaving aside the possibility\nparticle uniform GS of H;\n(0)\nthat the set Sf;\u03c3 \\Sf;\u03c3 of k points may be non-empty (see\nlater), interaction is seen to determine the topology of\nSf;\u03c3 solely through determining the subdivision of N into\n(0)\nN\u03c3 and N\u03c3\u0304 .

Our\n(0)\nfinding that Sf;\u03c3 \u2286 Sf;\u03c3 , directly leads us to conclude\nthat the Luttinger theorem [26,27] concerning the 'volume' of the interacting Fermi sea unreservedly applies\nto the Fermi sea pertaining to uniform metallic GSs of\nb It further leads us to uncover a kinematic constraint\nH.\nthat in many instances bars partially spin-polarized uniform states from being legitimate GSs of the Hubbard\nHamiltonian. We relegate an extensive discussion of this\nkinematic constraint to a future publication; for now\nhowever, we only mention that the existence of this constraint clarifies the conspicuous absence of partially polarized ferromagnetic regions in large portions of the zerotemperature phase diagram of the Hubbard Hamiltonian,\nspecifically in the strictly tight-binding limit where direct\nhopping of fermions is restricted to their nearest neighbours (see, for instance, [28,29]). We thus mainly ascribe\nthe failure of the Stoner criterion in its incorrect prediction of uniform ferromagnetic GSs in regions of the latter\nphase diagram where there is none (see, e.g., Fig. 5 in\n[30]), to the disregard by the Stoner theory of the abovementioned kinematic constraint.\nWe further deduce that the FL metallic state breaks\ndown at locations of the interacting Fermi surface Sf;\u03c3 coinciding with saddle points of the non-interacting singleparticle energy dispersion \u03b5k and that the two characteristic features of the pseudogap region of the putative\nFermi surfaces of interacting metallic states are inseparably interdependent. To clarify the latter aspect, we point\nout that experimentally pseudogap regions of the putative Fermi surfaces of the (underdoped) cuprate compounds [31\u201334] are characterized by:\n\nTi,j =\n\n1 X\n\u03b5k eik*(Ri \u2212Rj )\nNl\n\n(2)\n\nk\n\na hopping matrix element corresponding to the noninteracting (spin-degenerate) energy dispersion \u03b5k . For\nb\nsimplicity, in this work we only consider the GSs of H\nwhich preserve the full translational symmetry of the underlying Bravais lattice {Ri ki\nP= 1, . . . , Nl } so that both\nin Eq. (2) above and later, k signifies a sum over Nl\npoints in the first Brillouin zone (1BZ) corresponding to\nthe lattice {Ri }. It is common practice to choose\nP the\norigin of the energy to coincide with Ti,i = Nl\u22121 k \u03b5k .\nBy doing so, in the strict tight-binding limit, Ti,j is nonzero only when Ri and Rj are nearest neighbours, in\nwhich case it is identified with \u2212t < 0. None of our\nfollowing considerations relies on a strict tight-binding\napproximation to {Ti,j }.

(11) we observe that there must exist a comparable coherent contribution to A\u03c3 (k; \u03b5) at an\n\u03b5 inside the interval (\u03bc, \u221e); for k \u2192 Sf;\u03c3 , the required\n\u03b4-function contribution is located at \u03b5 = \u03bc+\nN ;\u03c3 > \u03bc (see\nEq.

The formal mode of expressing these observations is firstly that, the singular points of A\u03c3 (k; \u03b5) coincide with the solutions of\n\n\u03b5s;\u03c3 < \u03bc,\n(5)\n\u03b5s;\u03c3 > \u03bc,\n\n\u03b5s;\u03c3 < \u03bc,\n(6)\n\u03b5s;\u03c3 > \u03bc,\n\n\u22121/2 P\nwhere \u0109k;\u03c3 \u2261 Nl\nj \u0109j;\u03c3 exp(\u2212ik * Rj ), \u03bc is defined\nin Eq.

(6) is indicative of {\u03b5s;\u03c3 } consisting\nof two disjoint subsets, an aspect which has its root in\nour assumption concerning the stability of the (N\u03c3 +N\u03c3\u0304 )b By defining\nparticle GS of H.\n\n\u03b5k + h\u0304\u03a3\u03c3 (k; \u03b5) = \u03b5,\n\nwhere \u03a3\u03c3 (k; \u03b5) stands for the self-energy and secondly, that this equation has one solution at (k, \u03b5) =\n+\n\u2212\n+\n(k\u2212\nf;\u03c3 , \u03bcN ;\u03c3 ) and one solution at (k, \u03b5) = (k f;\u03c3 , \u03bcN ;\u03c3 ),\n\u2212\n+\nwhere kf;\u03c3 and kf;\u03c3 are respectively infinitesimally inside and outside the Fermi sea pertaining to fermions\nwith spin index \u03c3 in the vicinity of kf;\u03c3 \u2208 Sf;\u03c3 . The ne+\ncessity for the introduction of two vectors k\u2212\nf;\u03c3 and kf;\u03c3\narises from the fact that in principle (see \u00a7 3.4 in [25]),\nEq. (12), which corresponds to a uniform GS, cannot possess more than one solution at any given k; in the case of\nthe Hubbard Hamiltonian, where the momentum space\nis restricted to the 1BZ corresponding to the underlying\nlattice, all functions of k are periodic with the periodicity of the 1BZ, so that through Umklapp processes the\nlatter principle is not of general validity (see below).\nFor an arbitrary k, Eq. (12) has either no solution\nor it has real-valued solution(s) (see above) [25]. From\nthe above considerations we deduce that a singular behaviour (not necessarily a discontinuity) in n\u03c3 (k) at\nk = k0 6= k\u2213\nf;\u03c3 , with k f;\u03c3 \u2208 Sf;\u03c3 , implies the existence of\n\n\u03bc\u2212\nN ;\u03c3 :=EN ;0 \u2212 EN\u03c3 \u22121,N\u03c3\u0304 ;0 ,\n\u03bc+\nN ;\u03c3 :=EN\u03c3 +1,N\u03c3\u0304 ;0 \u2212 EN ;0 ,\n\n(7)\n\nthe disjoint nature of the above-mentioned two sets of\nexcitation energies can be expressed as follows\n+\n\u03bc\u2212\nN ;\u03c3 < \u03bc < \u03bcN ;\u03c3 , \u2200\u03c3.\n\n(8)\n\n\u2212\nFor non-metallic states, \u03bc+\nN ;\u03c3 \u2212\u03bcN ;\u03c3 is finite, equal to the\nfundamental gap in the single-particle excitation spectrum of the system. For metallic (thus microscopic) GSs,\n\u2212\np\n\u03bc+\nN ;\u03c3 \u2212 \u03bcN ;\u03c3 is infinitesimally small, scaling like 1/N\nwith p > 0; however it is non-vanishing. For these states,\nthe Fermi energy \u03b5f is formally equal to \u03bc\u2212\nN ;\u03c3 (in which\ncase the subscript \u03c3 is redundant when N\u03c3 , N\u03c3\u0304 6= 0; it\nis not redundant when N\u03c3\u0304 = 0) and its undue identification with \u03bc (which lies in an open interval) can give\nrise to erroneous or ill-defined results. To appreciate this\naspect, consider the single-particle spectral function\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002e\ne\u03c3 (k; \u03b5 + i\u03b7)\nG\u03c3 (k; \u03b5 \u2212 i\u03b7) \u2212 G\n2\u03c0i\nX\n\u2261 h\u0304\n|f\u0304s;\u03c3 (k)|2 \u03b4(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5s;\u03c3 ),\n\nA\u03c3 (k; \u03b5) :=\n\n(i)\n\nat least two (real-valued) solutions \u03b5k0 ;\u03c3 , i = 1, 2, which\ndo not necessarily correspond to quasiparticle excitations\n(1)\n(2)\n+\nand for which \u03b5k0 ;\u03c3 < \u03bc\u2212\nN ;\u03c3 and \u03b5k0 ;\u03c3 > \u03bcN ;\u03c3 hold. The\nvalidity of the latter inequalities is readily verified by\nconsidering Eqs. (10) and (11) along the lines presented\nabove. The observation of singular behaviour in n\u03c3 (k)\npertaining to the GS of the Hubbard Hamiltonian for\nd = 1 in the limit of U \u2192 \u221e at k different from \u00b1kf;\u03c3\n(for instance at k = \u00b13kf;\u03c3 in the case corresponding to\nn\u03c3 = n\u03c3\u0304 = 1/4) [37,38] implies that at these k the corresponding single-particle spectral function must possess\nat least two pronounced peaks, one below \u03bc\u2212\nN ;\u03c3 and one\nabove \u03bc+\n.\nN ;\u03c3\nMaking use of the anticommutation relations for the\ncanonical fermion operators \u0109\u2020k;\u03c3 and \u0109k;\u03c3 , it can be readily shown that\nX\n\u2217\nf\u0304s;\u03c3\n(k)f\u0304s;\u03c3 (k\u2032 ) = \u03b4k,k\u2032 , k, k\u2032 \u2208 1BZ;\n(13)\n\n\u03b7\u21930\n\n(9)\n\ns\n\nfor which we have\nZ\n1 \u03bc\nd\u03b5 A\u03c3 (k; \u03b5) = n\u03c3 (k),\nh\u0304 \u2212\u221e\nZ \u221e\n1\nd\u03b5 A\u03c3 (k; \u03b5) = 1 \u2212 n\u03c3 (k).\nh\u0304 \u03bc\n\n(12)\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nFor some metallic states (satisfying condition (A) introduced in \u00a7 11.2.2 below), including FLs, n\u03c3 (k) undergoes a discontinuous change upon transposing k from\ninfinitesimally inside to infinitesimally outside the Fermi\nsea; the amount of discontinuity is by a Migdal theorem [36,27] equal to the weight of a \u03b4-function contribution to A\u03c3 (k; \u03b5) at \u03b5 = \u03b5f , the Fermi energy. From\nEq.

(23) reproduces the definition for the non-interacting Fermi surface,\n(0)\n(0)\nnamely Sf;\u03c3 :={k k \u01ebk;\u03c3 = \u03b5f }. We should point out that\nSf;\u03c3 as defined in Eq. (23), as well as its non-interacting\n(0)\ncounterpart Sf;\u03c3 , need not be simply-connected, as evidenced by the fact that for d = 1, for instance, nei(0)\nther Sf;\u03c3 nor Sf;\u03c3 is simply-connected. However, even\n(0)\nfor cases where Sf;\u03c3 and Sf;\u03c3 are not simply-connected\nsets (either jointly or separately), the number of k points\n(0)\ninside FS\u03c3 and FS\u03c3 (the 'volume' of the Fermi sea) is\nwell-defined. 2 This is in fact even the case for nonmetallic GSs for which Sf;\u03c3 is an empty set. An aspect\nof special importance, both generally and particularly for\nour considerations in this work, is the validity of a Luttinger theorem [27,26] according to which the number of\nk points interior to FS\u03c3 is equal to N\u03c3 . The non-triviality\nof the Luttinger theorem at issue therefore rests on the\ndefinition for FS\u03c3 in Eq. (18) for interacting systems, for\nwhich no orthonormal set of single-particle wavefunctions\ncan be associated with the single-particle excitations (see\nEq. (14) above). As an essential ingredient of the proof\nof the Luttinger theorem at issue is dependent on a termby-term analysis of the perturbation series for \u03a3\u03c3 (k; \u03b5),\nit has been variously suggested that the Luttinger theorem should not be of general validity.

The finding to the contrary\nby Schmalian, et al.

Thus the region\n(0)\nSf;\u03c3 \\Sf;\u03c3 , when non-empty, can be identified with the\npseudogap region, which has been detected, amongst others [41], in the experimental photoemission spectra concerning the cuprate compounds Bi2 Sr2 CaCuO8+\u03b4 [31\u201333]\nand La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 [34] in the underdoped region (for a\nrecent review of the photoemission experiments concerning cuprates see [42]). Theoretically, these observations\nhave been most recently associated with the formation\nof \"charge and spin gap\" and \"truncation of the Fermi\nsurface\" into disconnected 'arcs' (in d = 2) in the neighbourhoods of the saddle-points of \u03b5k , and attributed to\n\"Umklapp scattering processes across the Fermi surface\"\n[43]; inspired by the physics of the M -leg ladder compounds [44\u201350], the present authors have identified the\ncorresponding metallic state as being an 'insulating spin\nliquid' (ISL) [51,52] (see also [53\u201358]). We relegate a\ndiscussion of the physical state associated with the pseudogap phenomenon to a future publication.\nCalculations of Sf;\u03c3 based on the second-order perturbation expansion of \u03a3\u03c3 (k; \u03b5) in terms of the non(0)\n(0)\ninteracting Green function G\u03c3 indicate Sf;\u03c3 6\u2286 Sf;\u03c3\n[59\u201362]. By construction, in these calculations FS\u03c3 con(0)\ntains the same number of k points as FS\u03c3 (in [61], for\ninstance, by choosing the second-order change in \u03bc to be\ngiven by a Fermi-surface average, the number of k points\n(0)\ninside the calculated FS\u03c3 is equal to that inside FS\u03c3 to\nthird order in U ) so that within the frameworks of these\ncalculations the question with regard to the validity or\notherwise of the Luttinger theorem has not been considered. The essential shortcoming of the perturbative\ndetermination of Sf;\u03c3 along the lines followed by [59\u201362]\nbecomes evident by realizing that one of the two fun-\n\ndamental conditions for k to be located on Sf;\u03c3 is that\ne \u03c3 (k; \u03b5k;\u03c3 )] = 0, where \u03b5k;\u03c3 = \u03b5k + h\u0304\u03a3\ne \u03c3 (k; \u03b5k;\u03c3 ) (cf.\nIm[\u03a3\nEq. (12)), a condition not taken account of in the cited\nreferences; this occurs because, for FLs (note this aspect)\nto second order in U , Im[\u03a3\u03c3 (k; \u03b5)] does not feature in the\nequation for Sf;\u03c3 . Consequently, and as can also be explicitly verified, the Sf;\u03c3 obtained by [59\u201362] does not\nsatisfy one of the necessary conditions defining Sf;\u03c3 . The\ngravity of violating this condition can be appreciated by\nrealizing the fact that an inappropriate sign (to be cone \u03c3 (k; \u03b5k;\u03c3 )], foltrasted with magnitude) assigned to Im[\u03a3\nlowing an incorrect subdivision of the momentum space\ninto interior and exterior of the Fermi sea, amounts to the\ninstability of the GS of the system under consideration.\nIt follows that Sf;\u03c3 is far more tightly constrained than\ncan be determined to second order in U (more generally,\nto any finite order in U ).\n\u00a7 5.

(22)\nand (23) in the work by Lieb and Wu [67], which concern\nthe exact solution of the Hubbard model for d = 1 (specific to \u03b5k = \u22122t cos(k), where k is in units of the inverse\nlattice constant) at half-filling, from which one obtains\n\u2212\nthat (\u03bc+\nN ;\u03c3 + \u03bcN ;\u03c3 )/2 = U/2 for all U and that, for U \u2193 0,\n+\n\u2212\n\u03bcN ;\u03c3 \u2212 \u03bcN ;\u03c3 approaches zero exponentially rapidly; for\ninstance, for U/t = 1 this gap is equal to 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 t,\nwhereas for U/t = 0.1 it is equal to 5.9 \u00d7 10\u22126 t.\n\u03b5f =\n\nto the entire 1BZ), and \u03b5>\nk;\u03c3 over FS\u03c3 .\nHaving established some fundamental (and, for our\npresent considerations, relevant) aspects of G\u03c3 (k; \u03b5), we\nare now capable of exposing a number of exact properties of the metallic GSs of the Hubbard Hamiltonian. In\nline with our above considerations, we restrict ourselves\nto GSs whose spatial periodicity is that implied by the\nunderlying lattice {Rj }. With\n\u039b\u03c3 (k):=\n\nf;\u03c3 ;\u03c3\n\nSince \u03b5f is a constant, the anisotropy of \u03b5k together with\nthe constancy of U n\u03c3\u0304 with respect to k necessitate the\nfundamental general result presented in Eq. (24). We\npoint out that, on the basis of this result, for the case of\nhalf-filling (corresponding to n\u03c3 = n\u03c3\u0304 = 1/2) where by\nconvention (see text following Eq.

Thus for interacting metallic GSs, the two energy\n>\ndispersions \u03b5<\nk;\u03c3 and \u03b5k;\u03c3 coincide (up to infinitesimal corrections) with \u03b5f for k \u2208 Sf;\u03c3 .

Illustration of the kinematic constraint in Eq. (63).\n\nthe conditions n\u03c3 , n\u03c3\u0304 6= 0 imply that Eq. (63) has no\nbearing on fully ferromagnetic states, such as the Nagaoka state [68,69]. Leaving aside the fact that here n\u03c3\nand n\u03c3\u0304 (and in consequence, kf;\u03c3 and kf;\u03c3\u0304 ) correspond\nb (as opposed\nto the exact (N\u03c3 + N\u03c3\u0304 )-particle GS of H\nto an uncorrelated (N\u03c3 + N\u03c3\u0304 )-particle state), the condition in Eq. (63) is equivalent to that within the framework of the Hartree-Fock scheme (see, e.g., Eq. (7.6) in\n[70]). This aspect is immediately understood by considering the fact that the Hartree-Fock formalism is a variab\ntional approach, in which the many-body Hamiltonian H\nis exactly taken account of and the underlying approximation solely concerns the uncorrelated nature of the\nHartree-Fock GS; in other words, Eq. (63) could have\ndirectly been inferred from its Hartree-Fock counterpart\n(i.e. from Eq. (7.6) in [70]). To clarify this, let us consider Eq. (63) within the framework of the Hartree-Fock\nscheme whereby its validity is undisputed. The appearb\nance of U on the RHS of Eq. (63) has its origin in H,\nwhich, as we have mentioned above, is treated exactly\nwithin the Hartree-Fock framework. Consequently, accounting for the neglected correlation in the latter framework, which is implicit in the exact GS |\u03a8N ;0 i, cannot\nentail introduction of contributions to Eq. (63) with explicit dependence on U . It follows that the difference\nbetween the latter expression and its exact counterpart\nmust reside in n\u03c3 (and consequently n\u03c3\u0304 or equivalently,\nkf;\u03c3 and consequently kf;\u03c3\u0304 ) which is an implicit function\nof U . This demonstrates that the functional form of the\nexpression in Eq. (63) is universal and indeed Eq. (63) is\nvalid also within the framework of the exact theory. 5\n\nAs we have indicated above, we relegate an extensive\ndiscussion of the expression in Eq. (63) to a future publication, in which we contrast the scarcity of the solutions n\u03c3 6= n\u03c3\u0304 (satisfying n\u03c3 + n\u03c3\u0304 = n) to Eq. (63) with\na wide range of results that clearly indicate a similar\nscarcity of ferromagnetic GSs for the single-band Hubbard Hamiltonian in particular for hyper-cubic lattices\nand strictly tight-binding \u03b5k for various d. For completeness, for d = 1, for the tight-binding energy dispersion\n\u03b5k = \u22122t cos(k) (where k is in units of the inverse lattice\nconstant) Eq. (63) takes on the form\nn\u03c3 \u2212 n\u03c3\u0304 = \u2212\n\n\u0003\n2t \u0002\ncos(\u03c0n\u03c3 ) \u2212 cos(\u03c0n\u03c3\u0304 ) ,\nU\n\nwhich has to be solved in conjunction with the requirement n\u03c3 + n\u03c3\u0304 = n. Our analytic and numerical work on\nthe latter transcendental equation [17] reveals that this\nequation almost entirely accounts for the fact embodied\nby a theorem due to Lieb and Mattis [71] according to\nb for d = 1 corwhich the total spin S of the GS of H\nresponding to \u03b5k = \u22122t cos(k) and U 6= \u221e is equal to\nzero.

(63) for d = 2\ncorresponding to\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b5k = \u22122t cos(kx ) + cos(ky ) + 4t\u2032 cos(kx ) cos(ky ),\nt > 0, t\u2032 \u2265 0, at and close to the van Hove density nvh (defined as the density for which the Fermi energy of the unpolarized state of the non-interacting fermions coincides\nwith \u03b5k at k = (\u03c0, 0), or any of the symmetry-related k\npoints) are in conformity with the findings by Honerkamp\nand Salmhofer [72,73] based on so-called temperatureflow renormalization-group scheme for t\u2032 /t \u2248 0.3; for\nt\u2032 = 0 and general n, our results conform with the Monte\nCarlo results obtained by Hirsch [74] and the findings by\nRudin and Mattis [75].\n\n5\nIt appears that the presumed first-order transition from\nparamagnetic to fully ferromagnetic uniform GSs (and vice\nversa) within the Hartree-Fock framework must have been the\ncause for the widespread disregard of the counterpart of the\nconstraint in Eq. (63) in Hartree-Fock calculations; Eq. (63)\nis always satisfied for n\u03c3 = n\u03c3\u0304 = n/2, and it does not apply\nto cases where n\u03c3 = n and n\u03c3\u0304 = 0, or n\u03c3 = 0 and n\u03c3\u0304 =\nn. Our careful numerical investigations [17] reveal that there\nare instances where n\u03c3 6= n\u03c3\u0304 , satisfying n\u03c3 + n\u03c3\u0304 = n, solve\nEq. (63) and moreover yield the lowest variational energy in\ncomparison with the energies of both paramagnetic and fullyferromagnetic uniform states. This is specifically the case for\n\ninstances where \u03b5k is expressed in terms of t and t\u2032 and for\ndensities n at and close to the associated van Hove densities.\n\n10\n\n\fb\nsurface of the metallic GS of H.\nHellmann-Feynman theorem\n\n\u00a7 9.

In\ncases where Zkf;\u03c3 6= 0, \u039b\u03c3 (k) in Eq. (58) is similar to\nn\u03c3 (k) discontinuous for k \u2208 Sf;\u03c3 . In spite of these, both\nn\u03c3 (k) and \u039b\u03c3 (k) are well-defined functions for kf;\u03c3 \u2208\nSf;\u03c3 ; we have namely\nn\u03c3 (kf;\u03c3 ):=\n\nNow, since by the\n\n(67)\n\n(0)\n\nrevealing a significant aspect of Sf;\u03c3 \\Sf;\u03c3 which we have\nidentified as the pseudogap region of the putative Fermi\n11\n\n\f(i)\n\n|\u03b6k;\u03c3 | \u223c |B(kf;\u03c3 )| kk \u2212 kf;\u03c3 k\u03b3 for k \u2192 Sf;\u03c3 .\n\ndescriptive. Note that, although \u03b5k0 ;\u03c3 , i = 1, 2, satisfy\nEq. (12), nonetheless since in the case at hand Zk0 ;\u03c3 = 0\n(see Eq. (67)), the spectral function A\u03c3 (k0 ; \u03b5) does not\n(i)\npossess quasiparticle peaks at \u03b5 = \u03b5k0 ;\u03c3 , i = 1, 2, but\nresonances. Experimentally [31\u201334], this feature is characteristic of the under-doped cuprates for which, in the\nnormal state, in certain regions of the k space that conventionally would be considered as constituting the Fermi\nsurface, the expected coherent quasiparticle peak in the\nangle-resolved photo-emission spectrum is missing, and,\nfurther, a gap (experimentally identified as the interval\nbetween \u03b5f and the 'leading edge' of the broad peak in\nthe angle-resolved photo-emission spectrum) in this spectrum persists for T greater than the superconducting\ntransition temperature Tc .\n\nWe consider three cases: case I, 0 < \u03b3 < 1; case II,\n\u03b3 = 1; case III, \u03b3 > 1. The findings corresponding to\ncase I equally apply to cases where, for instance,\n|\u03b6k;\u03c3 | \u223c |B(kf;\u03c3 ) ln kk \u2212 kf;\u03c3 k| kk \u2212 kf;\u03c3 k\u03b3 for k \u2192 Sf;\u03c3 .\n(78)\nIn fact, the results corresponding to case I also apply\nto the case corresponding to \u03b3 = 1 when, instead of\nEq. (77), Eq. (78) holds; in such an event, our considerations corresponding to \u03b3 = 1 become redundant. We\nemphasize that in principle the functional form of \u03b6k;\u03c3\nfor k \u2192 Sf;\u03c3 can depend on the location of k, whether\ninside or outside FS\u03c3 . Thus, for instance, the behaviour\nof \u03b6k;\u03c3 for k \u2192 Sf;\u03c3 may be governed by two powers \u03b3 <\nand \u03b3 > , with \u03b3 < 6= \u03b3 > , for k \u2208 FS\u03c3 and k \u2208 FS\u03c3 respectively. We shall not explicitly deal with such instances,\nhowever our following analyses can be readily extended\nto cover these.\nFor completeness, we mention that following some algebra (involving for instance use of the equation of motion for \u0109k;\u03c3 in the Heisenberg picture) we obtain\nR\u03bc\no\n1 n \u2212\u221e d\u03b5 \u03b5 A\u03c3 (k; \u03b5)\nR\u03bc\n(79)\n\u2212 \u03b5k \u2212 n\u03c3\u0304 .\n\u03b6k;\u03c3 =\nU\nd\u03b5 A\u03c3 (k; \u03b5)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u00a7 11. The behaviour of n\u03c3 (k) for k \u2192 Sf;\u03c3\n\nNow we proceed with considering the behaviour of\nn\u03c3 (k) for k close to Sf;\u03c3 . Equation (53) suggests that\n<\n\u03b2k;\u03c3\nshould be best described as follows:\n<\n\u03b2k;\u03c3\n= n\u03c3 (k) \u03bek;\u03c3 .\n\n(71)\n\nThis form is general and does not impose any restriction\n<\non the behaviour of \u03b2k;\u03c3\nin regions where n\u03c3 (k) 6= 0. Owing to Eq. (60) (see also the text following this equation)\nand the result in Eq. (61), for metallic states we must\nhave\n\nMaking use of Eqs. (61), (64) and (72), from Eq.

General\nFor the considerations in this case, it is crucial to be\nexplicit with regard to the location of k (i.e. whether\nk \u2208 FS\u03c3 or k \u2208 FS\u03c3 ) for k \u2192 Sf;\u03c3 . This is established\nby determining the sign of the inner product n\u0302(kf;\u03c3 ) *\n(k \u2212 kf;\u03c3 ), where n\u0302(kf;\u03c3 ) stands for the outward unit\nvector normal to Sf;\u03c3 at k = kf;\u03c3 , pointing from FS\u03c3\nto FS\u03c3 . In order to simplify our subsequent analyses,\nunless we explicitly indicate otherwise, in what follows\nwe assume k \u2212 kf;\u03c3 to be collinear with n\u0302(kf;\u03c3 ); that is,\nfor sufficiently small kk \u2212 kf;\u03c3 k we assume that\n\n(82)\n\nSolving for the Fermi surface Sf;\u03c3 , that is solving (see\nEq.

(90). For conciseness, in what follows we\nemploy the notation\n\nNote the significant fact that in the case under consideration, n\u03c3 (k) is continuous in neighbourhood of k = kf;\u03c3 ,\nso that (see Eq. (64) and our remark with regard to the\nsignificance of the following result)\nZkf;\u03c3 = 0.\n\n(89)\n\n(87)\n\n\u2213\nb\u2213\n\u03c3 :=b\u03c3 (k f;\u03c3 ).\n\nWe point out that for the Hubbard (at half-filling 6 or\nU/t \u2192 \u221e) (see [37,78\u201380]) and the Tomonaga model (see\n[81]) for d = 1, both n\u03c3 (\u00b1kf;\u03c3 ) = 1/2 and Z\u00b1kf;\u03c3 = 0.\nThe result in Eq. (87) implies that in the case under\nconsideration, \u03a3\u03c3 (k; \u03b5), with k \u2208 Sf;\u03c3 , is not a continuously differentiable function of \u03b5 in a neighbourhood of\n\u03b5 = \u03b5f [82]. As an explicit calculation shows [82] (see\nappendix D herein), for the one-dimensional Luttinger\ne \u03c3 (k; z)/dk dimodel [83,84] we in addition have that d\u03a3\nverges for all z as k \u2192 \u2213kf;\u03c3 . Equations (77) and (78),\nwith 0 < \u03b3 < 1 and 0 < \u03b3 \u2264 1 respectively, are suge \u03c3 (k; z) as\ngestive of a similar singular behaviour in \u2207k \u03a3\nk \u2192 Sf;\u03c3 . We therefore conclude that the identification with \"Luttinger-liquid\" by Anderson [85,86,3] of the\nmetallic states of the Hubbard Hamiltonian for (specifically) d = 2, entails that the case considered here (concerning 0 < \u03b3 < 1, or, in the event Eq.

The above opposing observations\nindicate that our rigorous finding relating a\u03c3 = 0 to the\nbreakdown of the FL state at k = kf;\u03c3 cannot be viewed\nas being a priori evident.\nWhether n\u03c3 (kf;\u03c3 ), as presented in Eq.

(99) above. For completeness, in contrast\nwith case I considered above, in the present case and\nprovided that Zkf;\u03c3 6= 0, one can similar to the case of\nFLs (to be considered below) ascribe effective mass and\n(Fermi) velocity to low-lying single-particle excitations\nof the system; however, in contrast with the case of FLs,\nthese characteristics are different for the excitations inside and outside the Fermi sea FS\u03c3 . Consequently, for the\npresent case, one can directly generalize, for instance, the\nsemi-classical theory of metallic conduction (see Chapter\n13 in [93]). By doing so, one would obtain a generalized\nDrude formula for the conductivity tensor which along its\nprincipal axes would involve two distinctive masses, corresponding to the single-particle excitations inside and\noutside FS\u03c3 close to Sf;\u03c3 . In this generalized Drude formula, the quantitative difference between the masses can\nbe formally fully accounted for by introducing two distinctive relaxation times. Further, the discontinuity in\nthe present case in the 'Fermi velocity' across the Fermi\nsurface Sf;\u03c3 gives rise to a temperature-independent contribution to the conductivity, or the associated relaxation times. These observations should be relevant to\nthe physics of the cuprates in view of the appearance of\ntwo transport relaxation times in various transport coefficients of these materials (see [94\u201396]).\n\nIt is easily seen that for a\u03c3 = 0 (signifying kf;\u03c3 as a saddle\npoint, also referred to as a van Hove point [in regard to\nthe density of the non-interacting single-particle states],\n\u2213\n\u2213\nof \u03b5k ), n\u03c3 (k\u2213\nf;\u03c3 ) = 1/2 and for U |b\u03c3 | \u2192 \u221e, n\u03c3 (k f;\u03c3 ) \u2192\n1/2, implying, through Eq. (64), that Zkf;\u03c3 = 0 in the\nformer case and Zkf;\u03c3 \u2192 0 in the latter. 7 Later, for\nFL metallic states (encompassing those which in spite of\n(0)\nSf;\u03c3 \\Sf;\u03c3 6= \u2205, share the basic characteristics of FLs) we\n(0) \u0001\ndeduce U b\u2212\n\u03c3 = h\u0304 \u03bbv f;\u03c3 \u2212 v f;\u03c3 (see Eq. (111) below) and\nU b+\n\u03c3 = \u2212h\u0304\u03bbv f;\u03c3 , where \u03bb is a finite positive constant.\nThus for FLs U |b\u2213\n\u03c3 | are bounded even when U \u2192 \u221e,\nsince for these systems kvf;\u03c3 k is finite. Evidently, this\nobservation concerning U \u2192 \u221e solely demonstrates the\nself-consistency of the FL theory within the framework\nof our considerations in this paper and does not rule out\nthe possibility of the breakdown of a FL metallic state as\nU is increased towards large values (for instance, through\nthe change of \u03b3 = 1 into \u03b3 = \u03b30 < 1).\nFor completeness, we mention that quantum Monte\nCarlo results obtained by Hlubina, et al. [87], corresponding to a 16 \u00d7 16 square lattice (for R:=2t\u2032 /t = 0.94,\nU/t = 2 and n = nvh , where t\u2032 stands for the hopping integral corresponding to next-nearest-neighbour sites and\nnvh for the van Hove density - for definition, see above)\n\"suggest that the smearing of the momentum distribution function n(k) does not increase close to the VH\n[van Hove] points.\" For the model energy dispersion\n\n11.2.2. Fermi-liquid metallic states\nWe consider a metallic state as being a FL provided\nthat the following conditions hold [82].\n(A) \u03a3\u03c3 (k; \u03b5), with k \u2208 Sf;\u03c3 , is continuously\ndifferentiable with respect to \u03b5 in a neighbourhood of \u03b5 = \u03b5f ;\n\n7\n\nWe point out that, for conventional energy dispersions,\na\u03c3 \u2192 0 for n\u03c3 \u2192 0; that is, we similarly have Zkf;\u03c3 \u2192 0 in\nthe low-density limit.\n\n14\n\n\fAs we demonstrate below, these results are equivalent to\n(see Fig. 3)\n\n(B) \u03a3\u03c3 (k; \u03b5f ) is continuously differentiable\nwith respect to k in a neighbourhood of kf;\u03c3 ,\n\u2200kf;\u03c3 \u2208 Sf;\u03c3 .\n\n\u2207k \u03b5>\nk;\u03c3\n\n(0)\nSf;\u03c3\n\nSince\ndoes not feature in these conditions, the cases\n(0)\ncorresponding to Sf;\u03c3 \\Sf;\u03c3 6= \u2205 are also accounted for\nhere. We note in passing that satisfaction of condition\n(A) is sufficient for Zkf;\u03c3 6= 0, so that metallic states with\nZkf;\u03c3 6= 0 are not necessarily FLs.\nFor FL metallic states\n\nk=k\u2212\nf;\u03c3\n\n= \u2207 k \u03b5<\nk;\u03c3\n\nk=k+\nf;\u03c3\n\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u21d0\u21d2 a\u03c3 + U b+\n\u03c3 = a\u03c3 \u2212 U \u039b\u03c3 b\u03c3 .\n\n1BZ\n\nIm[\u03a3\u03c3 (k; \u03b5)]\n\u03b2\n\u223c C\u03c3 (k)|\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5f |\u03b1 |ln |\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5f ||\nRe[\u03a3\u03c3 (k; \u03b5)] \u2212 \u03a3\u03c3 (k; \u03b5f )\n\n>\n\u03b5 k;\u03c3\n\nas \u03b5 \u2192 \u03b5f , where C\u03c3 (k) > 0, \u03b1 > 0 and |\u03b2| \u2265 0. On\naccount of this, neglecting Im[\u03a3\u03c3 (k; \u03b5)], the equation for\nthe single-particle excitation energies, i.e. Eq.

Interestingly, the\nfinite-temperature (T = 0.015t/kb) numerical calculations based on the fluctuation-exchange, FLEX, approximation to the self-energy operator of the single-band\nHubbard Hamiltonian on a square lattice for d = 2 with\nU/t = 8 [18] indicate n\u03c3 (k) to deviate from 1/2 for k \u2208\nSf;\u03c3 ; for n\u03c3 = n\u03c3\u0304 = 0.265 and kf;\u03c3 = \u03c0(0.61024 . . . , 0)\n(in units of the inverse lattice constant), n\u03c3 (kf;\u03c3 ) \u2248 0.38\n(see Fig. 4 in [18]). By considering the t-J Hamiltonian\nas the strong-coupling limit of the Hubbard Hamiltonian\n(see footnote 1), in which limit the small exchange integral J is formally equal to 4t2 /U [21,22], accurate numerical results for n\u03c3 (k) pertaining to uniform GSs of the\nt-J Hamiltonian (deduced from a twelfth-order expansion in the inverse temperature [97] and corresponding\nto T = 0.2J/kb ) for J/t = 0.5 and 1.0 [19] and specifically J/t = 0.4 [20] (J/t \u2248 0.4 formally corresponds\nto U/t \u2248 10.0) confirm our above conclusion that the\nunderlying uniform metallic GSs cannot be FL (see Appendix for some details concerning aspects of the n\u03c3 (k)\nassociated with the t-J Hamiltonian). As our finding in\nEq. (24) makes evident, the interpretation provided by\nthe authors [19,20], namely that the Luttinger theorem\n[27,26] concerning the number of k points enclosed by the\nSf;\u03c3 associated with the underlying metallic GS, breaks\ndown, cannot be the appropriate interpretation. We note\nin passing that the Fermi surface as depicted in Fig. 1 of\n[20] is the locus of the k points for which n\u03c3 (k) = 1/2\n[98]. It is important to point out that, since according to\nthe numerical results in [19,20] n\u03c3 (k) 6= 1/2 for k \u2208 Sf;\u03c3 ,\nit is excluded that Zk = 0 for k \u2208 Sf;\u03c3 , so that the underlying states must fail to be FL solely on account of\nthe failure of condition (B) presented above.\n\ngebra, we obtain\nv f;\u03c3 =\n\n\u0011 1\nn\u03c3 (k\u2212\n1 \u0010 (0) 1\nf;\u03c3 )\n(0)\nv f;\u03c3 + U b\u2212\n\u2261\nv f;\u03c3 .\n\u03c3\n\u2212\n\u03bb\nh\u0304\n\u03bb 2n\u03c3 (kf;\u03c3 ) \u2212 1\n(111)\n\nAs we have indicated earlier, the three vectors in\nEq.

We note in passing that Eqs. (105)\n>\nand (106) imply that \u03b5<\nk;\u03c3 and \u03b5k;\u03c3 form a Dirac-type\nspectrum for k approaching Sf;\u03c3 (see Fig. 3).\n\nIn connection with the above observations, we mention that the locus of the k points for which n\u03c3 (k) = 1/2,\nwith n\u03c3 (k) the extrapolation (based on a finite mesh of k\npoints) of the finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo\nresults by Moreo, et al. [99], pertaining to the Hubbard\nHamiltonian on a 16 \u00d7 16 square lattice with U/t = 4\n(at T = t/(6kb ) and for n\u03c3 = n\u03c3\u0304 = 0.435) almost iden(0)\ntically coincides with Sf;\u03c3 . As is evident from our above\nconsiderations, this result is not sufficient (although it is\nnecessary) for the underlying metallic state to be identified as a FL. From the available numerical data we are\nnot capable of deducing whether the FL metallic state\nbreaks down for U/t > Uc /t, with Uc a finite (positive)\nconstant, although in view of the above-mentioned Monte\n>\nCarlo results [99] it is tempting to believe that Uc /t \u223c\n4.\nThis in particular in view of the fact that, for U/t = 4\n(and T = 0.05t/kb ) the n\u03c3 (k) as obtained within the\nframework of the FLEX approximation [100] does not\nshow any noticeable asymmetry with respect to 1/2 for\nk = k\u2213\nf;\u03c3 (see Fig. 13 in [100]), in stark contrast with the\nn\u03c3 (k) corresponding to U/t = 8 [18], discussed above.\nFrom Eqs. (101), (102) and (105) and some simple al-\n\n11.3. Case III: \u03b3 > 1\n\nIn this case, from Eqs.

Consequently, \u03b3 > 1 is not permissible.\n\u00a7 12. Concluding remarks\n\nIn conclusion, our considerations in this work make explicit the considerable significance of the non-interacting\nenergy dispersion \u03b5k , in terms of which the single-band\n\n16\n\n\fb is defined, in accurately describHubbard Hamiltonian H\ning the low-energy single-particle excitations of the associated correlated metallic systems; not only is the shape\nof Sf;\u03c3 determined by \u03b5k (leaving aside the dependence on\nN\u03c3 , and thus on U , of \u01eb\u03c3 through Eq. (21)), but also can\nthe suppression to zero of the quasiparticle weight Zkf;\u03c3\nat kf;\u03c3 \u2208 Sf;\u03c3 be brought about (not exclusively) by the\nchoice of \u03b5k in such a way that, for a given n\u03c3 , kf;\u03c3 coincides with a saddle point of \u03b5k . Although our theoretical\nfindings combined with some available numerical results\nconcerning the Hubbard and the t-J Hamiltonian reveal\nthat on a two-dimensional square lattice, and at least\n>\nfor U/t \u223c\n8, the metallic GSs of the single-band Hubbard\nHamiltonian are not FL, the NFL states at issue are in\ngeneral (that is, for a rigid band energy dispersion \u03b5k described in terms of nearest-neighbour and next-nearestneighbour hopping integrals, t and t\u2032 respectively) neither\npure marginal-FL nor pure Luttinger-liquid (in spite of\nthe assumed homogeneity of the GS, depending on \u03b5k and\nthe band fillings n\u03c3 and n\u03c3\u0304 , the low-lying single-particle\nexcitations can be strongly anisotropic in the momentum\nspace); the latter states are specifically characterized by\nsingle-particle spectral functions which lack a coherent\nlow-energy quasiparticle peak on Sf;\u03c3 and are variously\nidentified with the normal metallic states of the cuprate\nsuperconductors. Assuming the sufficiency of the singleband Hubbard Hamiltonian for describing the low-lying\nsingle-particle excitations of the cuprate superconductors in their normal metallic states, our findings imply\nthat further considerations based on more general energy dispersions than those expressed in terms of t and\nt\u2032 are paramount; our considerations make explicit that\nthe functional form of such energy dispersions may even\nbe required to depend on the band filling n, that is, a\nrigid \u03b5k may in general not suffice. The significance of\nthe t\u2032 , in particular in the underdoped (in connection\nwith the pseudogap phenomenon in cuprates) and overdoped (in connection with the occurrence of ferromagnetism and strong ferromagnetic fluctuations) regions of\nthe phase diagram of the single-band Hubbard Hamiltonian for d = 2 has been already recognized.\n\nAPPENDIX: A.
