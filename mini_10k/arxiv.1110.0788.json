In addition, the concurrent appearance of these orderings does not necessarily mean that\nthe magnetic and electric dipoles are strongly coupled to\neach-other.\nAfter almost fifty years of research in the field, the discovery of the giant magnetoelectric response in TbMnO3 4\nhas launched a new concept: spin driven ferroelectricity.\nIn the last decade \u2013 along with experimental realizations\n\u2013 many theoretical explanations have been proposed as\nthe source of electric polarization in magnetically ordered\nmaterials. Electric polarization induced by cycloidal\nspin order was explained through spin chirality5 or inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism6 and was found\nexperimentally in many materials, including TbMnO3 ,4\nNi3 V2 O8 ,7 CuFeO2 ,8 MnWO4 ,9 CoCr2 O4 ,10 LiCu2 O2 11\nand CuO12 , just to mention a few. Exchange striction\ncan also lead to electric polarization, as was shown in\nthe case of the perovskite RMnO3 materials, with R being a rare earth ion.13 The aforementioned mechanisms\nmay induce polarization jointly, as predicted in the case\nof RMn2 O5 materials.14\u201316 In all these cases the mechanism involves two spins on a bond.\nIf the spin is located on a site that breaks the inversion symmetry, the polarization can be induced by a sin-\n\ngle spin. The origin of this process is the spin dependent metal-ligand hybridization arising from spin-orbit\ncoupling.17,18 Murakawa and collaborators proposed that\nthis mechanism explains the induced ferroelectric polarization in Ba2 CoGe2 O7 .19\nAs a result of strong easy-plane anisotropy, below\nTN = 6.7 K the S = 3/2 moments order into a canted\nantiferromagnetic pattern that is confined in the Co\u2013\nplane.20 This canted planar antiferromagnetic phase is\na multiferroic phase in which magnetoelectric behavior\nhas been observed. Ascribed to the symmetry properties\nof Ba2 CoGe2 O7 the sum over the vector spin chirality\nSi \u00d7 Sj vanishes and the exchange interaction Si * Sj is\nuniform for all bonds. Hence the induced polarization\ncannot be explained by the concept of spin current or\nexchange striction. Spin dependent hybridization mechanism was suggested as a solution, according\nP4 to which the\nlocal polarization takes the form of P \u221d i=1 (S * ei )2 ei ,\nwhere ei vectors point from the Co ions toward the surrounding four O ions.19 This model intrinsically possesses\nthe symmetries of the lattice and gives the same result\nfor the magnetization dependence of the polarization vector as a thorough symmetry analysis (e.g. in Ref. [21])\nwould. It recovers the sinusoidal response of electric polarization to the rotating magnetic field and describes the\nnature of induced polarization in magnetic field qualitatively well.19\nIn this paper we investigate the magnetic field dependence of induced electric polarization in Ba2 CoGe2 O7 .\nThe paper is structured as follows: we start with a short\nsymmetry analysis in Sec. II to deduce the Hamiltonian\nand the spin dependent expression of the polarization.\nIn Sec. III we study the field dependence of polarization\nat zero temperature variationally, using a site factorized\nwave function. Two cases are considered, when the ex-\n\n\f2\nternal field is applied along the [110] and [100] axes. We\ninvestigate the effect of DM interaction and an additional\nantiferro polarization term in detail. In Sec. IV we perform finite temperature mean field approximation to calculate the polarization and magnetization for both field\nsettings. We qualitatively compare our h||[110] results to\nthe experimental findings of Ref. [19] and give predictions\nfor the induced polarization with regard the h||[100] field\nsetting.\n\n(a)\n\n21\n\nA\n\n\u03c3[110]\nS4\n\n\u2212gh\n\ni\n\n(i,j)\n\n(i,j)\n\nX\ni\n\n\u015ci + Dz\n\nX\n\n\u0010\n\n(i\u2208A,j\u2208B)\n\n\u015cix \u015cjy \u2212 \u015ciy \u015cjx\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere (i, j) denotes pairs of nearest neighbor sites.

The\nneighboring CoO4 tetrahedra are tilted from the [110]\ncrystallographic direction by the angles \u00b1\u03ba, and due to\nthe differently oriented tetrahedral environments the unit\ncell contains two Co2+ ions with S = 3/2.\nThe point group of the lattice is isomorphic to\nthe group D2d that consists of the groups S4 =\n{E, S4 , C2 , S43 }, with the rotation axis located on the Co\nsites, and of C2v = {E, C2 , \u03c3[110] , \u03c3[110] } in the center of\nthe four Co sites, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The symmetry\nproperties of the lattice determine the terms that can be\nincluded in the Hamiltonian, i.e. the terms that transform as the fully symmetric irreducible representation\nA1 of D2d . When classifying the operators we assume\nthat the magnetic order is a two-sublattice order, i.e.\nthe magnetic unit cell corresponds to that of the lattice.\nOur Hamiltonian has the form of\n\u0011\nX\nX\nX\u0010\n(\u015ciz )2\n\u015ciz \u015cjz + \u039b\n\u015cix \u015cjx + \u015ciy \u015cjy + Jz\nH = J\n\n\u03c3[110]\n\nB\n\nA\nII.\n\nA\n\n[010]\n\n[110]\n\ny\n\nx\n\n[110]\n\n(b)\nA\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\n\u03ba\n\n[100]\n\n\u2212\u03ba\n\nA\n\nFIG. 1: A schematic figure of Ba2 CoGe2 O7 . (a) the point\ngroup of this material can be constructed from the groups S4\nand C2v acting on the Co sites and in the middle of four sites,\nrespectively. The mirror planes are labeled by their normal\nvector. (b) due to the tilted tetrahedral environment the unit\ncell contains two Co2+ ions that we denote by A and B. The\nsymmetry allowed DM vectors \u2013 with respect to the order of\ninvolved sites (black arrows) \u2013 are indicated by purple arrows.\nAt the \u0393 point the in\u2013plane components of DM vector cancel\neach-other thus in our case it is sufficient to take only the\nout\u2013of\u2013plane components into account.\n\ni\u2208B\n\nwith hx = h[110] and hy = h[110] . Although, we found\nthat it has no significant effect on the field dependence\nof the polarization, therefore we did not include it in our\nmodel.\nAs mentioned before, the polarization P and the spin\nbehave in different ways under inversion (I) and time\nreversal (T ) operations: IP = \u2212P and T P = P , while\nIS = S and T S = \u2212S. For there is no inversion center in\nBa2 CoGe2 O7 , we only have to account for T , and it follows that the polarization can be coupled linearly to operators that are even-order in spin and consequently are\ninvariant under time reversal. With respect to the lattice symmetry, the z-component of polarization vector \u2013\n\nor in fact any polar vector \u2013 transforms as the irreducible\nrepresentation B2 of D2d , while the in-plane components\n(px , py ) belong to the two dimensional representation E.\nClassifying the second-order spin operators according to\nlattice symmetry we find that, e.g. (\u015cjy )2 \u2212 (\u015cjx )2 and\n\u015cjx \u015cjy + \u015cjy \u015cjx transform as the irreducible representation B2 as well, therefore they can be coupled to the\nz-component of polarization. Similar logic leads to the\n\n\f3\nform of the operators P\u0302 x and P\u0302 y :\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nP\u0302jx \u221d \u2212 cos 2\u03baj \u015cjx \u015cjz + \u015cjz \u015cjx \u2212 sin 2\u03baj \u015cjy \u015cjz + \u015cjz \u015cjy\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\nP\u0302jy \u221d cos 2\u03baj \u015cjy \u015cjz + \u015cjz \u015cjy \u2212 sin 2\u03baj \u015cjx \u015cjz + \u015cjz \u015cjx\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\nP\u0302jz \u221d cos 2\u03baj (\u015cjy )2 \u2212 (\u015cjx )2 \u2212 sin 2\u03baj \u015cjx \u015cjy + \u015cjy \u015cjx (3)\nwhere j belongs to either sublattice A, or B. The different orientation of the tetrahedra is accounted for by\nchoosing \u03baj\u2208A = \u03ba and \u03baj\u2208B = \u2212\u03ba. Note that the operators defined in (3) are actually quadrupole operators.\nIII.\n\nZERO TEMPERATURE VARIATIONAL\nAPPROACH\n\nBased on the neutron scattering measurements of\nRef. [20] that suggested a two-sublattice canted antiferromagnet as the ground state, we chose a site factorized\nvariational wave function:\nYY\n|\u03a8i =\n|\u03c8i i|\u03c8j i ,\n(4)\ni\u2208A j\u2208B\n\nwith\n3\n1\n1\n3\n|\u03c8A i \u221d u0 | i+ei\u03be1 u1 | i+ei\u03be2 u2 |\u2212 i+ei\u03be2 u3 |\u2212 i (5)\n2\n2\n2\n2\nand\n1\n1\n3\n3\n|\u03c8B i \u221d v0 | i+ei\u03b81 v1 | i+ei\u03b82 v2 |\u2212 i+ei\u03b83 v3 |\u2212 i (6)\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n\u221a\n \u0303\nparallel to the applied field h[100] : \u015cjx = 1/ 2(\u015cjx \u2212 \u015cjy )\n\u221a\n \u0303\nand \u015cjy = 1/ 2(\u015cjy + \u015cjx ). In the case h||[1, 0, 0], the\nHamiltonian in the new basis has exactly the same form\nas (1) when the field is parallel to [1, 1, 0]. The polarization operators, on the other hand, change. Considering\nthe z-component of P\u0302 , in the new basis it will have the\nform of\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n \u0303  \u0303x\n \u0303  \u0303\n \u0303\n \u0303\n \u0303\nP\u0302jz = cos 2\u03ba\u0303j (\u015cjy )2 \u2212 (\u015cjx )2 \u2212 sin 2\u03ba\u0303j \u015cjx \u015cjy + \u015cjy \u015c(8)\nj\nwith \u03ba\u0303 = \u03ba + \u03c0/4. In order to an easier understanding\nof the relation between induced polarization in the two\nbasis we sketched the effect of local basis transformation\nin Fig. 2. As it was pointed out in Ref. [19], the induced\npolarization has extremum when the spin is aligned with\neither the upper or the lower edge of the surrounding\ntetrahedra. (The lower and upper edges are those parallel to the Co-plane.) If Pjz is maximal for a given spin\norientation, the \u03c0/2-rotation of the spin will cause the\npolarization to change sign. When the spin lays halfway\nbetween these two positions, the polarization is zero. Applying the field in the direction [110], the spins on the two\nsublattices are tilted (by the same angle) from the same\nsymmetry plane of the tetrahedra, therefore the induced\npolarization on A and B has the same sign (and magnitude). However a \u03c0/4 rotation of the local basis rotates\nthe tetrahedral environment in a way that the spins on\nA and B are now tilted from the different edges, and as\na result the induced polarizations have different sign on\nthe two sublattices. (see Fig. 2)\n(a)\n\n(b)\n[010]\n\n[100]\n\n[100]\n\nz\n\nwhere the |3/2i, |1/2i, . . . denote the |S i of the spin\u20133/2\non the A and B sites.

Forgetting about the polarization, the two kinds of field settings can be mapped to each\nother by a \u03c0/4-rotation of the local basis.

In\nour notation Pjz takes maximum value for a spin aligned parallel to the lower edge (dashed line) and minimum value along\nthe upper (solid) edge. (a)Schematic spin configuration for\nh||[110] and Dz < 0. The spin induced polarization is the\nsame on the two sublattices for the spins are canted by the\nsame angle from the same (lower) edge of the tetrahedra.\n(b) Spin configuration for h||[100] and Dz < 0 after rotating the basis by the angle \u03c0/4. Note that due to the rotation of the tetrahedral environment the induced polarization\nchanges. The spins of the two subblatices are now canted from\nthe different edges, consequently the induced polarization on\nthem have different sign.\n\nAccording to this argument, when the field is parallel\nto [110] the relevant order parameter is the total polarization P\u0302 z = P\u0302Az + P\u0302Bz , whereas for h||[100] the staggered\ncomponent P\u0302zst = P\u0302Bz \u2212 P\u0302Az will give a finite expectation value. We shall note, that the difference between\n\n\f4\nthe two cases is related to the lattice symmetries as well.\nWhile along the [110] direction the symmetry operation\nthat connects site A with site B is a \u03c3[110] mirror plane,\nalong the [100] direction the sites can be transformed into\neach-other by a 21 screw axis. (see Fig. 1 (a))\nB.\n\nDz = 0\n\nLet us begin our investigations with the case Dz =\n0. In zero magnetic field the variational ground state of\n(1) is a planar antiferromagnet (superfluid) that breaks\nrotational symmetry U (1), and in which the staggered\n\u22a5\nin\u2013plane magnetic order parameter OU(1) = 12 |\u015c\u22a5\nA \u2212 \u015cB |\ny\nx\n23\nhas finite expectation value, where \u015c\u22a5\nThe\nj = (\u015cj , \u015cj ).\nplanarity is the consequence of the easy-plane single ion\nanisotropy and the U (1) symmetry breaking is related to\nthe fact that in the absence of an in-plane magnetic field\nthe Hamiltonian commutes with total S z . The ground\nstate wave function of site A can be expressed as\nz\n\n|\u03a8A i = e\u2212i\u03c6A \u015cA |\u03a8SF\nA i\nwith a single variational parameter \u03b7A :\n\u221a\n\u0001\n| 23 i + | \u2212 32 i + 3\u03b7A | 12 i + | \u2212 21 i\nSF\np\n|\u03a8A i =\n.\n2 +2\n6\u03b7A\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nand a similar expression stands for |\u03a8B i with parameters\n\u03c6B and \u03b7B . \u03c6A and \u03c6B determine the angles of the spins\nwith respect to the [110] direction. Furthermore we find\nthat \u03b7A = \u03b7B = \u03b7 \u2265 1 for the whole magnetization\nprocess. In zero field \u03c6A = \u03c6 and \u03c6B = \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c0, i.e. the\nspins are antiparallel.23 The U (1) symmetry breaking is\nmanifested in the fact that \u03c6 can take arbitrary value.\nIn a finite magnetic field \u03c6 is not arbitrary any longer\nand the canted spins turn so that the total magnetization points into the direction of the field. This two sublattice canted order is twofold degenerate because, in the\nabsence of the DM term, the Hamiltonian is invariant\nunder the exchange of sites A and B. With increasing\nfield the angle \u03b4\u03c6 = \u03c6A \u2212 \u03c6B between the spins of the\nsublattices decreases from \u03b4\u03c6 = \u03c0 to \u03b4\u03c6 = 0, while the\nlength of the spins is unchanged (\u03b7 is constant).\nAt a critical value (hc ) the two spins become aligned:\n\u03c6A = \u03c6B = 0 for the field parallel to [110] and \u03c6A =\n\u03c6B = \u2212\u03c0/4 for h||[100]. The two sublattice order vanishes and a uniform phase appears. The critical field,\nhowever, is not equal to the saturation field, the spins\nare not fully magnetized yet. With the further increase\nof the field the magnetization increases slowly as the spins\nreach their full length (i.e. \u03b7 decreases to \u03b7 = 1).\nThe polarization and magnetization for Dz = 0 in magnetic fields along the axes [110] and [100] are plotted with\nblack solid lines in Fig. 3(c) and 4(c), respectively. The\nspin configurations of the twofold degenerate canted order are shown in panel (a) and (b) of Figs. 3 and 4. In\nboth cases we indicated the canting angle of the spins\n\nwith respect to the applied field. Conveniently, in the\ncase of h||[110] this canting angle is \u03c6A and \u03c6B \u2013 following from the definition of the ground state (9). However,\nwhen h||[100] we need to introduce the canting angles \u03c6\u0303A\nand \u03c6\u0303B , to measure the angle from the [100]-axis. Actually \u03c6\u0303A and \u03c6\u0303B play the same role in the rotated basis\n \u0303\nintroduced in Sec. III A (when \u015c x is the spin component\nalong [100]) as \u03c6A and \u03c6B in the original basis. Furthermore one could express the ground state (9) in the\nrotated basis, using \u03c6\u0303A/B = \u03c6A/B + \u03c0/4.\n\nC.\n\nFinite Dz\n\nWhen the DM interaction is finite, the angle between\nthe spins of the sublattices A and B varies from \u03c0,\n(\u03c6A \u2212 \u03c6B 6= \u03c0), and the spins become canted even in\nzero magnetic field, with a canting angle depending on\nthe magnitude of Dz . Nonetheless, this canted antiferromagnetic state breaks the U (1) symmetry too, for Dz\ncontrols only the direction of the spins on different sublattices relative to each other, and S z remains a good\nquantum number ([H, S z ] = 0) as long as there is no\nfield applied in the plane. A finite magnetic field lifts\nthe U (1)-degeneracy and we enter into the canted antiferromagnetic phase, where the canting angle depends\non Dz and the field. The finite DM coupling \u2013 being\nsensitive to the exchange of A and B \u2013 lifts the twofold\ndegeneracy of the canted phase and depending on its sign\neither of these two states is preferred. (A sign difference\nin D * (\u015cA \u00d7 \u015cB ) is equivalent to the exchange of sites A\nand B). Similarly to the case Dz = 0, the variational parameters are \u03b7A = \u03b7B = \u03b7, and below the critical field \u03b7 \u2013\nconsequently the spin length \u2013 is constant, as opposed to\nh > hc , when the spins are partially magnetized and their\nlength increases with the field. Comparing our results to\nthe measurement of Ref. [19] in the case of h||[110], we\nfind that Dz < 0 is the appropriate choice.\nA schematic figure of the ground states in the canted\nphase is shown for h||[110] in Figs. 3(a) when Dz > 0 and\n3(b) when Dz < 0, and correspondingly in Figs. 4(a) and\n(b) for h||[100]. The magnetization and the spin order induced polarization is plotted in Figs. 3(c) and 4(c). Based\non the argument of Sec. III A, when the field is pointing in\nthe direction [110] the total polarization is finite, while for\nh||[100] the staggered polarization gives non-zero expectation value. We remark that with the choice of \u03ba = \u03c0/8,\nthe total polarization for h||[[1, 1, 0] and the staggered polarization for h||[1, 0, 0] would match perfectly. A finite\nDz interaction chooses different branches of the electric\norder parameter (Pz and Pzst ) for the two settings of magnetic field, e.g. Dz < 0 favors the higher branch of the\ntotal polarization for h||[1, 1, 0] and the lower branch of\nthe staggered polarization in the case of h||[1, 0, 0].\n\n\f5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nh[110]/J\n\n15\n\n20\n\nEffect of antiferro polarization term\n\nFor higher fields the polarization curve is satisfyingly\nsimilar to the measurements, however, the low field behavior cannot be explained using only the Hamiltonian\n(1). In order to reproduce the sharp decrease of polarization below h \u2248 1 T we add an anitiferro (Kz > 0)\npolarization term to our model:\nX\nP\u0302iz P\u0302jz\n(11)\nHpol = Kz\n(i,j)\n\nThis is a kind of anisotropic biquadratic term that is allowed by the symmetry. Since [Hpol , S z ] 6= 0, the U (1)\nsymmetry is lost with this term in the Hamiltonian. Instead, a fourfold degenerate ground state appears (actually this corresponds to the ground state discussed in\nRef. 24, where the order parameters in Ba2 CoGe2 O7 were\ninvestigated from purely the aspect of symmetries). We\nstart our investigation with Dz = 0 again. The spin direction is determined by the minimization of (11) and (1).\nAs it was discussed in Ref. [19] and Sec. III A, the orientation of the spins relative to the surrounding tetrahedron determines the induced polarization.(see Fig. 3(a)\nin Ref. [19]). When the spin is pointing along the lower\n(or upper) edge of the tetrahedron, the induced P z is\nmaximal (or minimal). Therefore a term P\u0302Az P\u0302Bz favors a\nspin configuration in which the spins on sites A and B\nare parallel to different edges.

Similarly to the case of h||[110] (a) and (b) are degenerate when Dz = 0. Whereas a finite Dz lifts this degeneracy,\nand Dz > 0 selects the canted state (a) while Dz < 0 prefers\nthe configuration of (b). (c) When h||[100] the uniform polarization vanishes (Pz = PzA + PzB = 0) and the staggered\npolarization Pzst = PzB \u2212 PzA gives a finite value.

The polarization term competes with the\nantiferromagnetic exchange interaction and the resulting\nground state is the canted state shown in Fig. 5(a). A\nfinite magnetization points along the [100] or [010] axes\nin these cases.\nWhen the DM interaction is finite this spin configuration is favored by Dz > 0 that only changes the canting\nangle. However, a Dz < 0 introduces frustration, as it\nprefers a reversed spin orientation: if the angle between\nthe spins is \u03c6A \u2212 \u03c6B for Dz > 0, it is \u2212\u03c6A + \u03c6B for\nDz < 0 (see Fig. 5(b)). Loosely speaking this corresponds to the exchange of sites A and B, however with a\nsmaller canting angle due to the competition of Kz and\nDz .\nSelecting Dz < 0 - that recovers the experimental results - we calculated the induced polarization for both\norientations of the magnetic field. The variational and\nthe finite temperature mean field results are shown together in Fig. 6 and 7 for h||[110] and in Fig. 8 when\nh||[100]. In the former case we observed a new phase\nbelow hc2 \u2248 1 T. This intervening phase is twofold degenerate. Following from the different spin length on\nthe sublattices A and B a suitable order parameter is\n|SA | \u2212 |SB |, therefore we refer to this phase as a canted\nferrimagnetic phase. The ground state can still be written as in (10), but here \u03b7A 6= \u03b7B . The angle between\nthe spins on sublattices A and B is determined by the\ncollective effect of Kz , Dz and h[110] .

A spin configuration \u2013 with smaller canting angle \u2013 shown in (a) would correspond to the case Dz = 0, too\n(c) when h||[110] a canted ferrimagnetic phase emerges below hc2 \u2248 1 T due to the polarization term. (d) for h||[100],\nsince Kz > 0, the canted ferrimagnetic phase is missing, and\nat finite field the ground state is the canted antiferromagnet\nsimilar to the case Kz = 0. A ferromagnetic polarization term\nwould have the opposite effect.\n\nconfiguration of this phase is shown in Fig. 5(c). When\nh > hc2 \u2248 1 T we enter the canted antiferromagnetic\nphase that was characteristic in the case Kz = 0 as well\n(see Fig. 3 (a)). When the field exceeds hc \u2248 13 T, the\npartially magnetized uniform phase emerges. In the rotated field setting (h||[100]) the intervening phase is missing, and only three phases are observed. The finite field\nlifts the fourfold degeneracy of the h = 0 ground state\nand we enter the non-degenerate two sublattice canted\nantiferromagnetic order shown in Figs. 5(d) or 4(b). At\nthe critical field the canted antiferromagnet is replaced\nby the uniform phase. We shall note that a ferro polarization coupling (Kz < 0) would reverse the situation,\nand it would cause the emergence of the canted ferrimagnetic phase when the field is h||[100], while for h||[110]\nthis phase would not be present.\n\nIV. FINITE TEMPERATURE MEAN FIELD\nTHEORY AND COMPARISON WITH THE\nEXPERIMENT\n\nAssuming site factorized solution for the finite temperature mean field calculations as well, we can write\nthe Hamiltonian as HMF = HA + HB , where\nHA =\n\ny\ny\nx\nx\n4JSA hSB i + 4Dz (SA\nhSB\ni \u2212 SA\nhSB\ni)\n2\n\nz\n+4Kz PAz hPBz i + \u039b (SA\n) \u2212 gh * SA ,\n\n(12)\n\nwith \u03b2 = 1/T . A similar expressions stand for hSA i\nand hPAz i with the interchange of A and B. The selfconsistent solutions of this set of equations, that constitute the mean-field approximation, is obtained by iteration.\nIn our finite T calculations we took a realistic parameter setting: J = Jz = 1.885 K, \u039b = 15.08 K according\nto Ref. [22], g = 2.2 and the values Dz and Kz were\nset to \u22120.02 K and 0.01 K respectively. The mean field\nresult for T = 2 K is essentially undistinguishable from\nthe T=0 variational calculation. For the field applied\nparallel to [110], we find that below hc2 \u2248 1 T the polarization drops to zero and in this region there is a finite\nexpectation value of m[110] and Pzst corresponding to the\nzero temperature canted ferrimagnetic phase. The fact\nthat these functions can take positive and negative values\nreflects the twofold degeneracy of the ground state. At\nhigher field we enter the canted antiferromagnetic region\nand at hc there is a continuous phase transition to the\npartially magnetized uniform phase where the spins are\naligned with the external field. With further increase of\nh[110] the spins grow to reach their full length. The finite\ntemperature results for magnetic field h||[1, 1, 0] are summarized in Fig. 6. Taking strictly the Hamiltonian (1)\nextended with the polarization term (11) we can recover\nthe main characteristics of the experimental findings in\nRef. [19]. The polarization drops sharply below 1 T and it\nchanges drastically with increasing temperature, whereas\nthe magnetization curve is almost unchanged. Torque\nmeasurements would be conclusive to our studies, and\ncould reveal if there is an orthogonal component of magnetization at low fields (h < hc2 ). Nonetheless, there\nare yet some properties to account for. The polarization curve in the experiments starts from negative value\nat zero field, while in our model - due to the antiferro\npolarization term - Pz = 0 when h = 0. Furthermore\naround hc2 the shape of the polarization is softer, in contrast with our findings, that exhibit an edge in Pz when\nthe canted ferrimagnet transforms into the canted antiferromagnetic phase. A possible solution to these anomalies can be the presence of a small orthogonal field. In\nFig. 7 we plotted our results for the same setting as in\nFig. 6, but with a small applied field in [110]. Naturally\nin this case the twofold degeneracy of the canted ferrimagnetic phase is lifted as the perpendicular field selects\nbetween \u00b1m[110] .\nIn Fig. 8 we show the results for h||[1, 0, 0]. As men-\n\n\f7\n\n(a)\n\n(a)\n\n3\n\nm[110]\n\ntioned before the relevant quantity in this case is the staggered polarization Pzst . In good agreement with our zero\ntemperature findings, the canted ferrimagnetic phase is\nabsent, and below hc the canted antiferromagnetic phase\ntakes place.

A detailed analysis has been given on the\neffect of DM interaction and an additional polarizationpolarization term for two orientations of magnetic fields:\nh||[110] and h||[100]. We found that in the former case\nan antiferro polarization coupling leads to the emergence\nof a canted ferrimagnetic phase when 0 < h < hc2 \u2248 1\nT. In this region the polarization decreases sharply reproducing qualitatively well the experimental findings in\nRef. [19]. Above hc2 the canted antiferromagnetic phase\n\nFIG. 7: As a possible solution to the differences in our results\nand the measurements, we applied a small magnetic field perpendicular to [110], e.g. h\u03b5 ||[110] and found that the characteristics of the experimental results are qualitatively well\nreproduced.(J = Jz = 1.885 K, \u039b = 15.08 K, Dz = \u22120.02 K,\nKz = 0.01 K and g = 2.2)\n\ntakes place, in wich the spins rotate according to the increasing field so that at hc \u2248 13 T they are aligned and\nthe uniform, partially magnetized phase appears. For\nh||[100], however, the canted ferrimagnetic phase is absent, and at finite field only the canted antiferromagnetic and partially magnetized phases can be observed.\nChanging the polarization-polarization coupling to ferro\ntype, the situation would be reversed: in h||[110] there\nwould be no sign of the canted ferrimagnet, while it would\nappear for h||[100]. Using the model that qualitatively\nrecovers the [110]-field measurements, we gave a prediction to the field dependence of polarization when h||[100].\nApplying finite temperature mean field theory we determined the polarization for both orientation of magnetic\nfield at various temperatures. The mean field results\ncapture qualitatively well the temperature dependence\nof polarization and magnetisation: while the former is\nvery sensitive to the temperature change, the latter is\nalmost unaffected by it. Based on our calculations, we\nbelieve that relevant information regarding the low field\nphase could be obtained from torque measurements.

We predict that in this rotated field setting the canted ferrimagnetic phase is missing, and the lower\npolarization curve is selected when Kz > 0. Similarly to the\nh||[110] case, the polarization depends strongly on the temperature, however the magnetization hardly changes.(J = Jz =\n1.885 K, \u039b = 15.08 K, Dz = \u22120.02 K, Kz = 0.01 K and\ng = 2.2)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are pleased to thank H.
