In this context, the present work generalises the\nhitherto known uniform IDS-approximation results for operators on the\nd-dimensional metric lattice to a very large class of geometries.\n\nMSC 2010: 47E05, 34L40, 47B80, 81Q10\nKeywords: random Schr\u00f6dinger operator, metric graph, quantum graph, integrated density of states\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe investigation of the spectrum of random Schr\u00f6dinger operators has a long\nhistory in mathematical physics. One reason for this is that many solution properties of differential equations are encoded in the spectrum of the involved operator. The most prominent example for a result describing this connection is the\nRAGE-Theorem (see, e.g. [30, Theorem 4.1.19]).\nIn this paper we study spectral properties of random Schr\u00f6dinger operators\non Cayley graphs over finitely generated, amenable groups G. The graphs are defined as metric graphs, meaning that each edge is associated with an interval of a\ncertain length. Hence, the operator acts on functions defined on the edges or the\nassociated intervals. Selfadjointness is obtained by choosing appropriate boundary conditions at the vertices. We will only deal with local boundary conditions\n1\n\n\facting separately on each vertex v and taking into account the functions linked\nwith the edges connected to v. The involved randomness occurs in the choice of\nthe potential, as well as in the boundary conditions. That way, we obtain a family (H\u03c9 )\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 of selfadjoint operators, where \u03a9 = (\u03a9, A, P) is a probability space\nendowed with some measure preserving, ergodic action by the amenable group G\nunder consideration. Studying spectral properties of (H\u03c9 ), it turns out that the\nrelavant object is a function describing the distribution of the spectrum, the socalled spectral distribution function (SDF). The SDF at point \u03bb \u2208 R is given via\nthe trace of the spectral projection of the operator on the interval (\u2212\u221e, \u03bb], see\nalso (6). In the special case where the operator in consideration is a Laplacian,\non may intuitively think of the SDF to measure the number of electron energy\nlevels below a given energy per unit volume.\nAs such a projection of an infinite dimensional operator is a rather abstract\nobject, it is useful to think of a more constructive way to understand the spectral\ndistribution. One approach in this direction is to consider a \"growing\" sequence\n(Qj )j\u2208N of finite sets exhausting the group G. The approximating operators shall\nthen be given as restrictions to these sets, such that one obtains a sequence\nQ\n(H\u03c9 j )j\u2208N of selfadjoint operators with discrete spectrum. For each j one defines\nQ\nthe eigenvalue counting function n\u03c9 j as the function which maps \u03bb \u2208 R to the\nQj\nnumber of eigenvalues of H\u03c9 , which do not exceed \u03bb. Here one counts eigenvalues\naccording to their multiplicities. Now the central issue is the behaviour of suitably\nnormalised counting functions. Precisely, the question arises whether there is\nsome function N : R \u2192 R such that one can give meaning to the limit relation\nN(\u03bb) := lim\n\nj\u2192\u221e\n\n1 Qj\nn (\u03bb).\nEQj \u03c9\n\n(1)\n\nIf the limit exists in a suitable sense, then we call N the integrated density of\nstates (IDS). With this construction at hand several questions immediately arise:\n\u2022 Does the limit in (1) exist? If so, in which topology?\n\u2022 Is N independent of the sequence (Qj ) and/or of \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9?\n\u2022 Does the IDS equal the SDF?\nIf the answer to the last question is positive, then one says that the Pastur-Shubintrace formula holds. Note that there are situations where the Pastur-Shubin-trace\nformula is not valid, c.f. [1]. Having defined the announced distribution functions,\nlet us now discuss the physical relevance of these objects. As mentioned before,\na considerable interest in the spectral type of selfadjoint operators has developed\nover the last decades. Results of this kind can be used to derive qualitative and\nquantitative properties of solutions to the corresponding difference or differential\noperator [32, 12]. To determine the spectral type, one may study particular\nproperties of the SDF, such as (dis-)continuity or the asymptotic behaviour at\n2\n\n\fthe spectral edges. For instance, Lifshitz tails [25] and Wegner estimates [34] are\ncrucial ingredients in the theory of Anderson localisation [2, 30, 27]. Moreover,\nthe investigation of continuity properties or the asymptotic behaviour of the IDS\n(or SDF) relies always on approximation techniques of the kind as described\nabove. In the light of that, the existence of the IDS and the validity of the\nPastur-Shubin trace formula are valuable reference quantities when studying the\nspectral type of an operator, as well as solution properties of operator equations.\nThe first investigations concerning the IDS are given in the seminal papers of\nPastur [26] and Shubin [29], where the authors obtained weak convergence in a\neuclidean setting. Since then, a wide range of geometric situations and various\nclasses of operators have been examined, see e.g. [1, 14, 31] for the continuous\nsetting and e.g. [4, 23, 24] for discrete geometries. It is well known that weak\nconvergence of distribution functions only implies pointwise convergence at the\ncontinuity points of the limit function. On the other hand, the IDS may exhibit\na large set of discontinuity points (which may be even dense in the spectrum),\nc.f. [7, 16, 33]. Therefore, in order to preserve essential spectral information in the\napproximation process (e.g. spectral jumps indicating the existence of compactly\nsupported eigenfunctions, cf. [21]), the question of stronger kinds of convergence\nof the IDS arises. This motivates the main goal of our paper to verify uniform\nconvergence for very general geometric settings. One particular approach is to\nuse Banach space valued, almost-additive ergodic theorems. For operators on\nDelone sets modeling a quasicrystal structure, this method was first applied in\n[17]. For combinatorial Cayley graphs, convergence results for almost-additive\nfunctions have been used in [11] for G = Zd , as well as in [19, 20] for a finitely\ngenerated, amenable group G containing a monotile F\u00f8lner sequence with respect\nto a symmetric grid. In [28], the authors prove an almost-additive convergence\nresult which is valid for all amenable groups. This latter theorem, in combination\nwith the famous Lindenstrauss ergodic theorem for amenable groups (cf. [22])\nwill be the major ingredient for our following elaborations, where we treat the\ngeneral case of uniform IDS-approximation on all metric Cayley graphs induced\nby finitely generated, amenable groups. Precisely, we give positive answers to all\nof the above formulated questions and we prove uniformity for the limit relation\ngiven by (1). Hence, our major Theorem 4.1 significantly extends the range of\npossible geometries. In particular, it allows for non-abelian structures. Thus, the\npresent paper brings out a direct generalization of the results in [5, 6], where the\nauthors assumed that G = Zd . Moreover, our main result is complementary to the\nelaborations in [13] concerning an abstract CW complex graph model with group\naction, as well as to the ones in [19, 20, 28], where the authors achieve uniform\nexistence of the IDS in the context of combinatorial graphs over amenable groups.\nLet us briefly describe the content of this paper. In section 2 we give some\nbasic features on the geometric setting. Section 3 describes the operator families\nin question. Restrictions to finite subgraphs are discussed in section 4, where we\nalso state the main results. In section 5 we apply an ergodic theorem obtained\n3\n\n\fin [28] (see [19] for a special case) to a sequence of spectral shift functions for an\nexhaustion of subgraphs. These results are used in section 6 to prove our main\ntheorem. Section 7 is devoted to an application. We show uniform approximation\nof the IDS for the Heisenberg group (which is, in fact, a non-abelian group).\n\n2\n\nMetric Cayley graphs over amenable groups\n\nLet G be a group, S \u2286 G a finite but not necessarily symmetric set of generators\nand id \u2208 G the unit element. We define the distance between two elements\ng, h \u2208 G to be the smallest number of elements in S \u222a S \u22121 one needs to turn h\ninto g by left multiplication, i. e.\n(\nmin{k \u2208 N | \u2203s1 , . . . , sk \u2208 S \u222a S \u22121 with s1 * * * sk h = g} if g 6= h\nd(g, h) :=\n0\notherwise.\nWe denote the set of all finite subsets of G by F . The diameter of a set Q \u2208 F\nis given by diam Q := max{d(g, h) | g, h \u2208 Q}. For a subset Q \u2286 G and g \u2208 G\nwe set d(g, Q) := min{d(g, h) | h \u2208 Q}. Given R \u2208 N and Q \u2208 F we define\n\u2202 R Q = {g \u2208 G | g \u2208 Q, d(g, G \\ Q) \u2264 R or g \u2208\n/ Q, d(g, Q) \u2264 R}. We assume that\nG is amenable, i. e., there exists a sequence (Qj )j\u2208N of elements in F such that\n|SQj \\ Qj |\n= 0.\nj\u2192\u221e\n|Qj |\nlim\n\nSuch a sequence (Qj ) is called F\u00f8lner sequence. A F\u00f8lner sequence is said to be\ntempered if there exists C > 0 such that\nj\u22121\n\n[\n\nQ\u22121\nk Qj \u2264 C|Qj |\n\nk=1\n\nholds for all j \u2208 N.\nRemark 2.1.\nrelation\n\n(a) It is easy to see that for a F\u00f8lner sequence (Qj )j\u2208N , the limit\n|\u2202 R Qj |\n=0\nj\u2192\u221e |Qj |\nlim\n\nholds true for all R \u2208 N, c.f. [19].\n(b) Note that each F\u00f8lner sequence has a tempered subsequence, c.f. [22].\nTherefore there exists a tempered F\u00f8lner sequence in each amenable group.\nFor a given group G and a finite set of generators S we denote the induced\n(directed) metric Cayley graph by \u0393 = \u0393(G, S) = (V, E, \u03b3), i.e., V = G is the\nvertex set, E the set of edges and \u03b3 = (\u03b30 , \u03b31 ) : E \u2192 V \u00d7 V associates to each\n4\n\n\fedge e \u2208 E the starting vertex \u03b30 (e) and the end vertex \u03b31 (e). There will be an\nedge e from v to w if there exists s \u2208 S such that w = sv. Such an edge e will\nthen be said to be generated by s. Every edge e \u2208 E generated by s \u2208 S will be\nidentified with the interval [0, ls ], where ls \u2208 (0, \u221e) for all s \u2208 S.\nExample 2.2. Let G = Z2 and set\nS1 = {(1, 0), (0, 1)} and S2 = {(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0), (\u22121, 0)}.\nThen S1 and S2 are generating systems for G. We denote the corresponding\nmetric Cayley graphs by \u03931 = \u03931 (G, S1 ) and \u03932 = \u03932 (G, S2 ). Note that while \u03931\nis the usual graph of Z2 with standard edges, \u03932 contains multiple edges as well\nas loops.\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of \u03931 (G, S1 ) and \u03932 (G, S2 ) from Example 2.2\n\n3\n\nRandom Schr\u00f6dinger Operators on graphs\n\nAll function spaces appearing in this paper will be K-valued, where K \u2208 {R, C}.\nFor s \u2208 S let Bs \u2286 L\u221e (0, ls ) be a finite subset. For e \u2208 E generated by s \u2208 S\nlet Ve \u2208 Bs . In the Hilbert space\nMM\nH\u0393 :=\nL2 (0, ls )\nv\u2208V s\u2208S\n\nwe define the maximal operator\nD(\u0124) :=\n\nMM\n\nW 2,2 (0, ls ),\n\nv\u2208V s\u2208S\n\n(\u0124f )e := \u2212fe\u2032\u2032 + Ve fe\n\n(e \u2208 E).\n\nIn order to obtain selfadjoint realisations we need to impose boundary conditions at the vertices. We will not consider the most general boundary conditions,\nbut rather restrict ourselves to so-called local boundary conditions.\nFor v \u2208 V, the collections\nEv,j := {e \u2208 E | \u03b3j (e) = v}\n5\n\n(j = 0, 1)\n\n\fdescribe the sets of all edges starting or ending at v, respectively, and\n\u0001\n\u0001\nEv := Ev,0 \u00d7 {0} \u222a Ev,1 \u00d7 {1}\n\nencodes all edges connected with v (where loops are counted twice).\nFor f \u2208 D(\u0124) and v \u2208 V we define the trace mapping (or boundary value\nmapping) trv f \u2208 KEv by\n(\nfe (0) (e, j) \u2208 Ev , j = 0,\n(trv f )(e, j) :=\nfe (ls ) (e, j) \u2208 Ev , j = 1, e generated by s.\nFurthermore, define the signed trace strv f \u2032 \u2208 KEv by\n(\nfe\u2032 (0)\n(e, j) \u2208 Ev , j = 0,\n(strv f \u2032 )(e, j) :=\n\u2212fe\u2032 (ls ) (e, j) \u2208 Ev , j = 1, e generated by s.\nRemark 3.1. (a) Note that W 2,2 (0, l) \u2286 C 1 [0, l] by standard Sobolev arguments and hence for f \u2208 D(\u0124), the vectors trv f and strv f \u2032 are well-defined\n(v \u2208 V).\n(b) The definition of the signed trace implies that the orientation of the edges\nplays a minor role. In particular, only the boundary conditions (see the\ndefinition below) take into account the direction of the edges.\nDefinition (local boundary conditions). Let v \u2208 V.

Therefore it is necessary to prove certain properties of the spectral shift\nfunctions. Before this we introduce the notion concerning the colouring of the\nCayley graph \u0393 = (V, E, \u03b3) associated to a given group G with finite set of\ngenerators S.\nLet Z be an arbitrary finite set. A map C : V \u2192 Z is called a colouring of \u0393\nand a map P : D(P ) \u2192 Z, where D(P ) \u2208 F , a pattern. Note that, as before, F\ndenotes the set of all finite subsets of G. We write P for the set of all patterns\nand for given Q \u2208 F we define the set P(Q) := {P \u2208 P | D(P ) = Q}. Given a\npattern P and a set Q \u2286 D(P ) the restriction of P on Q is the map P |Q : Q \u2192 Z\nwith P |Q (g) = P (g) for all g \u2208 Q. Equivalently, the restriction of a colouring\nC to a finite set Q \u2208 F is given by C|Q : Q \u2192 Z, C|Q (g) = C(g) for all g \u2208 Q.\nFor P \u2208 P and x \u2208 G the translation of P by x is defined by P x : D(P )x \u2192 Z,\n(P x)(g) = P (gx\u22121). We say that two patterns P, P \u2032 \u2208 P are equivalent (and\nwrite P \u223c P \u2032 ) if there exists x \u2208 G with D(P )x = D(P \u2032) and (P x)(g) = P \u2032 (g)\nfor all g \u2208 D(P \u2032 ). The induced quotient set is denoted by P\u0303 and the equivalence\nclass for given P \u2208 P by P\u0303 \u2208 P\u0303. For given patterns P1 , P2 \u2208 P we set \u266fP1 (P2 ) to\nbe the number of occurrences of P1 in P2 , i. e.\n\u266fP1 (P2 ) := |{P \u2208 P | P \u223c P1 , D(P ) \u2286 D(P2 )}|.\nDefinition.

Thus, the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem ([3, Theorem A.10.1]) implies that the\nclosure of alg(R) equals C0 (R). Moreover, using Cauchy's integral formula, one\nobtains, that if for all f \u2208 R one has\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nTr 1EQj f (H\u03c9 ) \u2212 f (H\u03c9Qj ) dP(\u03c9) \u2192 0 as j \u2192 \u221e,\n(11)\n\u03a9 EQj\nthen this holds true for all f \u2208 alg(R) as well. Hence, in order to prove that (11)\nholds true for all f \u2208 C0 (R), it is sufficient to verify this for all f \u2208 R. Let f \u2208 R,\ni.e., f (t) := (t \u2212 z)\u22121 . For j \u2208 N we can split \u0393 into \u0393Qj and \u0393G\\Qj . Then H\u03c9\nQ\nG\\Q\nand H\u03c9 j \u2295 H\u03c9 j differ only by the boundary conditions on the set VQ\u2202 j . Thus,\nby the second resolvent identity,\nD := f (H\u03c9 ) \u2212 f (H\u03c9Qj \u2295 H\u03c9G\\Qj )\nis an operator of rank at most 4 |S| VQ\u2202 j .

H3 is an example\nof a non-abelian group, which is of polynomial growth. Therefore it is amenable,\nas well as residually finite. One can show, see [19], that H3 is generated by\nS = {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0)} and that (Qj ) given by\nQj := {(a, b, c) | 0 \u2264 a, b < j, 0 \u2264 c < j 2 } (j \u2208 N)\nis a F\u00f8lner sequence. We denote the associated metric Cayley graph by \u0393 =\n\u0393(G, S) = (V, E, \u03b3).\nLet (\u03a9, A, P) beL\na probability space and let (H\u03c9 )\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 be a random Schr\u00f6dinger\noperator on H\u0393 = e\u2208E L2 (0, 1) defined as in (4) and (5) (where ls = 1 for all\ns \u2208 S).\nThen Theorem 4.1 proves that for increasing j the eigenvalue counting funcQ\ntions N\u03c9 j given by\n1 Q\n1 \b\nN\u03c9Q (\u03bb) :=\nn\u03c9 (\u03bb) =\n| n \u2208 N | \u03bbn (H\u03c9Q ) \u2264 \u03bb | (\u03bb \u2208 R, Q \u2208 F )\n|EQ |\n|EQ |\nconverge for P-a. a. \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 uniformly in the energy variable to the integrated\ndensity of states N : R \u2192 R defined by\nZ\n\u0001\n1\nTr 1EQ 1(\u2212\u221e,\u03bb] (H\u03c9 ) dP(\u03c9) (\u03bb \u2208 R),\nN(\u03bb) :=\n|EQ | \u03a9\nwhere Q \u2286 G is an arbitrary finite set.

Let Q \u2286 G be finite. Since H Q \u2295 H G\\Q \u2212 H is of finite rank (they differ\nonly on the boundary conditions at VQ\u2202 ), also\n(H + c)\u22121 \u2212 (H Q \u2295 H G\\Q + c)\u22121 = (H + c)\u22121 (H \u2212 H Q \u2295 H G\\Q )(H Q \u2295 H G\\Q + c)\u22121\nhas finite rank for sufficiently large c > 0. Hence,\n1EQ ((H + c)\u22121 \u2212 (H Q \u2295 H G\\Q + c)\u22121 )\nhas finite rank and is therefore trace class.\nQ\n\u22121/2\nBy [18, Proposition\nis a continuous linear mapping\nL\nL 5.3 \u221e(ii)], (H + c)\nfrom H\u0393Q to\nL\n(0,\nl\n)\nfor\nsufficiently\nlarge c > 0. Hence, by [35,\ns\nv\u2208Q\ns\u2208S\nQ\n\u22121/2\nSatz 6.14], 1EQ (H + c)\nis Hilbert-Schmidt. But\n(1EQ (H Q + c)\u22121/2 )\u2217 = (H Q + c)\u22121/2 1EQ\n17\n\n\fis again Hilbert-Schmidt, so\n1EQ (H Q + c)\u22121 1EQ = 1EQ (H Q + c)\u22121/2 (H Q + c)\u22121/2 1EQ\nis trace class and therefore also trace class on H\u0393 .\nSince\n1EQ (H Q \u2295 H G\\Q + c)\u22121 = 1EQ (H Q + c)\u22121/2 (H Q + c)\u22121/2 1EQ ,\nwe conclude that\n1EQ (H + c)\u22121 = 1EQ ((H + c)\u22121 \u2212 (H Q \u2295 H G\\Q + c)\u22121 ) + 1EQ (H Q \u2295 H G\\Q + c)\u22121\nis trace class.\nNow, we have\n1EQ 1(\u2212\u221e,\u03bb] (H) = 1EQ (H + c)\u22121 (H + c)1(\u2212\u221e,\u03bb]\u2229\u03c3(H) (H)\n\u0001\n= 1EQ (H + c)\u22121 z 7\u2192 (z + c)1(\u2212\u221e,\u03bb]\u2229\u03c3(H) (z) (H).\n\n\u0001\nSince z 7\u2192 (z + c)1(\u2212\u221e,\u03bb]\u2229\u03c3(H) (z) is bounded, this operator is trace class as well.\nNote that the trace norm depends on (H Q + c)\u22121/2 H \u2192L L L\u221e (0,ls ) and\n\u0393Q\nv\u2208Q\ns\u2208S\n\u0001\nz 7\u2192 (z + c)1(\u2212\u221e,\u03bb]\u2229\u03c3(H) (z) \u221e . Considering now (H\u03c9 )\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 instead of H, these\ntwo norms can be bounded uniformly in \u03c9, since there exists c > 0 such that\nH\u03c9 + c \u2265 0 for all \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9.
