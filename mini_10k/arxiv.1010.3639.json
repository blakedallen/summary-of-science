In the present work we are interested in the 3-state Potts model defined on a three dimensional cubic lattice. The generic q-state Potts model\nis defined by the following partition function\nX\ne\u2212\u03b2(E\u2212HM) ,\n(1)\nZ(\u03b2, H) =\n{\u03c3i }\n\nwhere the spin variable \u03c3i lives on lattice site i and can\ntake q different possible values, e.g. \u03c3i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , (q \u2212\n1)}, while \u03b2 = 1/(kB T ). E and M denote respectively\nthe energy and magnetization with respect to a chosen\nreference spin value \u03c3\u0304 (e.g. \u03c3\u0304 = 0):\nX\n(2)\n\u03b4\u03c3i ,\u03c3j\nE = \u2212J\nhi,ji\n\nM =\n\nX\n\n\u03b4\u03c3i ,\u03c3\u0304\n\n(3)\n\ni\n\nwhere J is the coupling constant, H is an external applied\nfield and hi, ji in the sum denotes all pairs of nearest\nneighbor lattice sites. In the following, as usual, we shall\nset J = 1 and make use of the normalized magnetic field\nh \u2261 \u03b2H.\nFor h = 0 the system has an exact symmetry, corresponding to all possible global permutations of the q spin\nvalues, i.e. the symmetry group is the group of permutations Sq . Such symmetry gets spontaneously broken below a given critical temperature, where the spin variables\nalign themselves along a given direction. The corresponding phase transition is first order, in three dimensions, for\nq \u2265 3, and second order for q = 2 (the system coincides\nwith the Ising model in this case). For q = 3 the critical\ntemperature is given by \u03b2c (h = 0) = 0.550565(10) [8].\nThe critical properties of 3D Potts models with q = 2\nor 3 at h = 0, have often been associated with those met\n\nat the finite T phase transition of QCD (with 2 or 3 colors) in the pure gauge limit, via the well known SvetitskyYaffe conjecture [3]. The symmetry group which is spontaneously broken in the high T, deconfined phase of\nSU (N ) pure gauge theories is that associated with center\nsymmetry, ZN , corresponding to local gauge transformations which are periodic in the Euclidean time direction\nonly up to a global group element belonging to the center\nof the gauge group. The symmetry group coincides with\nthe permutation group for N = 2, while for N = 3 one\nhas to add charge conjugation to center transformations\nto recover the full permutation group S3 . The corresponding order parameter in pure gauge theories, playing\nthe role of magnetization and signalling the spontaneous\nbreaking of center symmetry in the deconfined phase, is\nthe Polyakov loop, i.e. a closed parallel transport in the\nEuclidean time direction.\nFor h 6= 0 the symmetry Sq is explicitly broken to\na residual Sq\u22121 , corresponding to permutations among\nspin values other than the chosen direction \u03c3\u0304. The case\nh > 0, in which alignment of spin variables along \u03c3\u0304 is\nfavoured, has been extensively studied in the literature:\none can still distinguish two phases in which the system\nis more (low T) or less (high T) aligned along \u03c3\u0304, however\nin both phases the residual Sq\u22121 symmetry stays unbroken, so that no real phase transition is expected a priori.\nHowever, for q \u2265 3, the first order transition present\nat h = 0 persists also for non zero positive values of h,\ntill a critical endpoint is met, after which the transition\ndisappears. Such critical endpoint is expected to be in\nthe Ising 3D universality class and for q = 3 it has been\nlocated at (\u03b2c , hc ) = (0.54938(2), 0.000775(10)) [9, 12].\nIn the analogy with finite T pure gauge theories, the\ncase h > 0 corresponds to adding dynamical fermions\nof mass m and in the fundamental representation of the\ngauge group (the limit h \u2192 0 corresponding to m \u2192 \u221e):\nthat induces an effective coupling to the Polyakov loop,\nwhich breaks center symmetry and aligns the Polyakov\nloop along the positive real direction, while the residual\ncharge conjugation symmetry stays unbroken for all val-\n\n\f2\nues of T .\nThe case h < 0 is quite different. Indeed in this case\nthe reference state \u03c3\u0304 is disfavoured, so that low T ordering happens along one of the remaining q\u22121 states: there\nis therefore an order/disorder transition associated with\nthe spontaneous breaking of the unbroken Sq\u22121 symmetry group. Actually, in the limit of large |h|, the system\nbecomes completely equivalent to a (q \u2212 1)-state Potts\nmodel at zero magnetic field, since the disfavoured state\ndisappears from the statistical ensemble. Therefore a\ntrue phase transition is expected for every value of |h|,\ncoinciding with the transition of q- or (q \u2212 1)-state Potts\nmodel in the limit of zero or infinite field respectively.\nIn the present paper we shall discuss the case q = 3\nin three dimensions, which is particularly interesting (as\nwell as the case q = 5 in two dimensions), since in this\ncase the transition at h = 0 is first order, while the transition at h = \u2212\u221e is second order in the 3D Ising universality class. Hence the expectation is that the first\norder continues for small values of |h|, until a tricritical\npoint htric is met, governed by mean field indexes, after which the transition becomes second order in the 3D\nIsing universality class. An accurate verification of this\nscenario and the precise location of the tricritical point is\nthe aim of our study. Notice that, for small |h|, we expect\nan interesting example of system which may be naively\nbelieved in the Ising 3D universality class because of symmetry reasons (the relevant symmetry being Z2 ), but has\ninstead a first order transition because of the interplay\nwith different dynamical degrees of freedom, corresponding to the disfavoured state \u03c3\u0304 in this case.\nGoing back to the correspondence with the critical\nproperties of SU (3) lattice gauge theories, switching the\nsign of h is like turning the boundary conditions of dynamical fermions in the temporal direction from antiperiodic to periodic: fermions are not thermal any more\nand the Euclidean temporal direction can then be viewed\nas a compactified spatial direction; the effective coupling\nto the Polyakov line changes sign, so that the Polyakov\nline tends to align along one of the complex center elements below a given compactification radius, thus breaking spontaneously the residual charge symmetry (see e.g.\nRefs. [17\u201320] for early lattice studies of the associated\ntransition, which has been studied in the context of orientfold planar equivalence [21, 22]). Alternatively, one\ncan interpret the system as the usual thermal theory in\npresence of a purely imaginary quark number chemical\npotential such that Im(\u03bc)/T = \u03c0: in that case the Z2\nbreaking transition is interpreted as the endpoint of the\nhigh T Roberge-Weiss (RW) transitions which are met in\nthe T -Im(\u03bc) plane [23].\nThe importance of this Z2 transition and of its order for the general features of the QCD phase diagram\nhas been discussed extensively in recent literature [24\u2013\n29]. In particular, its order has been investigated by\nlattice simulations in QCD with two degenerate flavors\nin Ref. [26], and more recently also for the three flavor\ntheory [27]: in both cases one finds a non-trivial phase\n\n\u03bd\n\u03b3\n\u03b1\n\u03b3/\u03bd\n\u03b1/\u03bd\n3D Ising 0.6301(4) 1.2372(5) 0.110(1) \u223c 1.963 \u223c 0.175\nTricritical\n1/2\n1\n1/2\n2\n1\n1st Order\n1/3\n1\n1\n3\n3\nTABLE I: Critical exponents (see e.g. [31, 32]).\n\nstructure, with the transition being first order both for\nsmall and high quark masses, and second order in the\nmiddle. Such phase structure can be mapped to that of\nthe Potts model with a negative magnetic field, which is\nthe subject of our study, on the large mass side; on the\nother hand, on the small quark mass side, chiral degrees\nof freedom come into play, requiring a different effective\nmodel description. In the context of the investigation of\nthe QCD phase diagram, it is of course particularly important to give precise estimates of the tricritical values\nof the quark mass, separating the second order from the\nfirst order regions.\nThe study of the 3D three-state Potts model in a negative magnetic field can be placed in the more general\ncontext of studies of the same model in complex magnetic fields [11, 12, 27], aimed at mimicking the dynamics of QCD in presence of a quark chemical potential,\nwhich have also considered the properties of the tricritical\npoint [27]. Our purpose is that of performing a detailed\nstudy of the critical behavior of the system as a function\nof h, with the specific aim of determining the location\nof the tricritical field htric . We will make use of different and consistent approaches in order to do that: the\nstrategy developed for this model and the corresponding\nresults can then be taken as a guideline for the analogous\ndetermination of the tricritical masses for the endpoint\nof the Roberge-Weiss transition in QCD [30].\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we present\nand discuss the different strategies used to investigate the\ncritical properties of the system; in Sec. III we present\nour numerical results and finally, in Sec IV, we give our\nconclusions.\nII.\n\nOBSERVABLES AND NUMERICAL\nANALYSIS SETUP\n\nNatural observables for the Potts model are the energy\nE, which is defined in Eq. (2), and the magnetization. As\nfor the latter, we replace it by a new quantity P which,\nin the analogy with QCD, plays the role of the average\nPolyakov line. In order to define P , let us associate with\neach spin variable a complex number on the unit circle\nas follows\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni2\u03c0\u03c3i\nsi = exp\n;\n(4)\n3\nthen we define\nP =\n\n1 X\nsi ,\nV i\n\n(5)\n\n\f3\nwhere V = L3 is the lattice volume. Assuming that the\nstate coupled to the magnetic field is \u03c3\u0304 = 0, the residual\nZ2 symmetry of the model corresponds to an exchange\nof the states 1 and 2, i.e. to complex conjugation for the\ncomplex spin variables si and for P . Therefore, while\nE and Re(P ) are even under the residual Z2 symmetry,\nIm(P ) is odd and plays the role of the order parameter\nfor the realization of this symmetry.\nThe purpose of our investigation is that of determining\nthe location of the phase transition, its order and universality class, as a function of the magnetic field h, which\nis taken to be negative. In order to do that, we shall\nconsider at first the susceptibility of the order parameter\n\u03c7 \u2261 L3 (hIm(P )2 i \u2212 h|Im(P )|i2 )\n\n(6)\n\nL\n3D Ising\nscaling\n\nfirst order\nscaling\n\ntricritical scaling\n\nh tric\n\nh\n\nand the specific heat of the system\nC \u2261 L3 (hE 2 i \u2212 hEi2 ) .\n\n(7)\n\nThe scaling of the two quantities around the phase transition, as a function of the size of the system, is fixed by\nthe respective critical indexes\n\u03c7 = L\u03b3/\u03bd \u03c61 (tL1/\u03bd )\n\n(8)\n\nC = C0 + L\u03b1/\u03bd \u03c62 (tL1/\u03bd ) ,\n\n(9)\n\nand\n\nwhere C0 is a regular contribution and t \u2261 (T \u2212 Tc )/Tc\nis the reduced temperature. In the following we will be\ninterested in particular in the scaling of the height of the\npeaks, which is regulated by \u03b3/\u03bd and \u03b1/\u03bd respectively,\nand in the scaling of the width of the peaks, which is regulated by 1/\u03bd in both cases. The critical indexes which\nare relevant to the different possibilities which may take\nplace (i.e. first order, second order in the 3D Ising universality class and mean field tricritical) are listed in Table I.\nAnother interesting quantity is the modulus of P , however it takes contribution both from the order parameter\nand from the spin state coupled to the magnetic field,\nwhich is Z2 even, hence its susceptibility is expected to\nbe the mixing of different contributions scaling like \u03c7 or\nC respectively, apart from the limit h \u2192 \u221e, in which case\nthe contribution of the state coupled to h is completely\nsuppressed and the system can be mapped exactly to a\n3D Ising model. We shall not consider such quantity in\nthe following.\nIt is interesting to notice that, while first order scaling and 3D Ising scaling are expected to take place for\na continuous range of values of h, tricritical scaling is in\nprinciple expected only for a specific value htric , which\nwe want to determine, at the boundary between the first\norder and the second order region. However the correct expectation is to have tricritical scaling regulating a\nneighborhood of htric , with the size of the neighborhood\ngoing to zero as L \u2192 \u221e. Putting the question the other\nway around, we expect to need increasingly large volumes\nto discriminate between first order and 3D Ising second\n\nFIG. 1: On finite volumes tricritical scaling is expected to\ndominate a finite range of h values around htric , which shrinks\nto zero as L \u2192 \u221e.\n\norder as we approach the tricritical field htric from either\nside, since a fictitious tricritical scaling will mask the true\nthermodynamical limit for not large enough volumes (see\nFig. 1 for a graphical representation of that).\nThis reasoning can be made more quantitative by use\nof the so-called crossover exponents: in the thermodynamical limit, the true critical behaviour of the system\ncan be seen only for |t| . p1/\u03c6 , where t is the reduced\ntemperature, p is the parameter that controls the change\nof critical behaviour and \u03c6 is the crossover exponent (see\ne.g. [32\u201334]), which is by definition \u03c6 = yp /yt (yt and\nyp are the renormalization group eigenvalues of the relevant variables t and p). In our case p \u221d h \u2212 htric and\n\u03c6 = 1/2 [35]. On a finite lattice of typical size L, |t| can\nbe traded for L\u22121/\u03bd and the previous condition becomes\nL & |h \u2212 htric |\u2212\u03bd/\u03c6 ; in particular, according to the known\ntricritical indexes in Table I, one expects tricritical behaviour to dominate up to a critical size\nLc \u2243 A |h \u2212 htric |\u22121\n\n(10)\n\nwhere A is some unknown constant which may be different on the first order and on the second order side;\na numerical check of this behaviour will be reported in\nSec. III A (see in particular Fig. 10). That implies that\na correct and precise determination of htric may be quite\ndifficult if one looks at the finite size scaling of susceptibilities or other quantities alone.\nAs an alternative and easiest way to determine htric ,\nwe shall determine quantities which give a measure of the\nstrength of the first order transition, such as the latent\nheat or the gap of the order parameter at the transition,\nand study the variation of such quantities as a function\nof h, in order to extrapolate the point htric where they\nvanish, i.e. where the first order disappears, without the\nneed of making simulations very close to htric .\nWe shall consider in particular the Binder-ChallaLandau cumulant [36] of the energy, which is defined as\n\n\f4\na first order transition,\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\n10\n\nP(E/V)\n\n8\n\n\u03c7max \u223c A +\n\nL3 2\n\u2206 .\n4\n\n(12)\n\nBoth \u2206E and \u2206 are expected to vanish as we approach\nthe tricritical field htric from the first order side. In particular, the leading order expected behaviour is the following (see [35] or [38] for a brief summary)\np\n\u2206E \u221d h \u2212 htric\n(13)\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\nand\n0\n-1.8\n\n-1.7\n\n\u2206\u221d\n\n-1.6\n\nE/V\nFIG. 2: Probability distribution of the energy density for different lattice sizes L and h = \u22120.0025, where the transition\nis first order.\n15\n\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\nP(E/V)\n5\n\n0\n-1.8\n\n-1.75\n\n-1.7\n\n-1.65\n\n-1.6\n\n-1.55\n\nE/V\nFIG. 3: Probability distribution of the energy density for different lattice sizes and h = \u22120.01, where the transition is\nsecond order.\n\nB4 = 1 \u2212 hE 4 i/(3hE 2 i2 ). It can be shown (see e.g. [37])\nthat near a transition B4 develops minima whose depth\nscales as\n\u0012\n\u00132\n2\nE\u2212\n1 E+\nB4 |min =\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ O(L\u22123 )\n3 12 E\u2212\nE+\n\u0012\n\u00132\n2 1 \u2206E\n+ O(\u22063E ) + O(L\u22123 ) (11)\n\u2212\n=\n3 3\n\u01eb\nwhere E\u00b1 = lim\u03b2\u2192\u03b2c\u00b1 hEi, \u2206E = E+ \u2212 E\u2212 and \u01eb =\n1\n2 (E+ + E\u2212 ). In particular the thermodynamical limit\nof B|min is less than 2/3 if and only if a latent heat is\npresent; to simplify the notation in the following we will\nuse the shorthand B = 23 \u2212 B4 |min .\nA different, but analogous quantity is the gap of the\norder parameter, \u2206, which can be extracted by looking\nat the scaling of the maximum of its susceptibility, \u03c7,\nand using the relation, valid in the large volume limit for\n\n(14)\n\nAnother useful quantity is the fourth-order cumulant\nof the order parameter. This is usually defined by\nhM 4 i/hM 2 i2 ([39, 40]), where M is the order parameter,\nand is typically used in the study of second order transitions. Since in this work we will analyze mainly region of\nthe parameter space in which first order transitions are\npresent, the connected form\nU4 =\n\n10\n\np\n|(h \u2212 htric ) log(h \u2212 htric )|\n\nh(\u03b4M )4 i\nh(\u03b4M )2 i2\n\n\u03b4M = |ImP | \u2212 h|ImP |i\n\n(15)\n\nappears to be best suited to disentangle the fluctuations\ninside a thermodynamical phase from the tunneling between the two sectors with different Z2 magnetization.\nAnother reason to prefer the connected form is that at\nthe critical point it develops a minumum, making thus\npossible to obtain the value of the cumulant at the transition, without introducing cross-correlations with other\nobservables, or between different lattice size data. As a\nlast point, we note that the relative error of the cumulant\nvalue at transition turned out to be smaller by a factor\n2 for the connected cumulant than for the usual one.\nFor a first order transition it is simple to show that\nin the thermodynamic limit U4 \u2192 1, by using a double\ngaussian approximation for the distribution of the order\nparameter. For a second order transition it can be shown\nthat the value of U4 at the transition is a renormalization\ngroup invariant ([39, 40]), so that the intersection point\nof U4 calculated on two lattices of different size can be\nused as an estimator of the transition point. It can also\nbe shown that the slope of U4 at the transition point U4\u2217\nsatisfies the relation\n\u2202U4 (bL)\n\u2202U4 (L)\n\n= b1/\u03bd\n\n(16)\n\nU4\u2217\n\nthus giving an estimate of the \u03bd critical index.\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nThe first order transition, which is already quite weak\nat h = 0, gets weaker for negative h values, so that we do\nnot need to use algorithms specifically designed for strong\n\n\f5\n\n0.175\n\n\u03b1=0.110(1)\n\u03bd=0.6301(4)\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n20\n\nDiscerning the critical behaviour from finite\nsize scaling.\n\nOne way to discern between a first order and a second\norder critical behaviour1 is to look at the distribution\nof physical observables, like the energy, at the transition point: that is expected to develop a double peak\nstructure, in the thermodynamical limit, for a first order transition, while it stays single peaked in the second\norder case. In Figs. 2 and 3 we show two examples, for\nh = \u22120.0025 and h = \u22120.01 respectively, where the situation is quite clear: h = \u22120.0025 clearly belongs to the\nfirst order region, while h = \u22120.01 appears to be on the\nsecond order side.\n\na+bL\n\n120\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n70\n\n60\n\n80\n\nL\nFIG. 5: Scaling of the specific heat peak with L for h = \u22120.01.\nIn this case the correct scaling with 3D Ising critical indexes\nis visible already from moderate size lattices. \u03c72 /d.o.f. \u2243 0.95\n(range of fit: L > 20)\n600\n\na+bL\n500\n\n\u03b1=1/2 \u03bd=1/2\n\n400\n\nCmax\n\nA.\n\n140\n\nCmax\n\nfirst orders, like the multicanonical one.

For h =\n\u22120.025 (see Fig. 4) a cubic term in L, which is characteristic of first order, nicely fits the behaviour on the\nlarger volumes. For h = \u22120.01 (see Fig. 5) the situation\n\n1\n\nFor the sake of simplicity we will speak of \"critical behaviour\"\nalso for the case of first order transitions, although this is not\ncompletely appropriate.\n\nis also quite clear and data correctly scale according to\n3D Ising critical indexes.\nWhat is less clear is the critical behaviour of the specific heat peak for h = \u22120.005, which is shown in Fig. 6.\nData scale linearly with L, i.e. according to tricritical\nindexes, for a large range of lattice sizes, with small deviations, going in the direction of a smallest value of \u03b1/\u03bd\n(hence in the direction of the 3D Ising class), visible only\non the largest sizes explored, L > 100. Our subsequent\nanalysis will clearly show that for this value of h the system belongs to the 3D Ising universality class, however\nit would have been difficult to state that clearly from the\nscaling of the specific heat alone: tricritical indexes regulate the system behavior till L \u223c 100, completely mask-\n\n\f6\ning the correct thermodynamical limit, which would be\nevident only on much larger lattices.

Notice however that, in order to correctly fit data, it is necessary to take into account also a\nsmall but non-zero contribution proportional to L2 ; this\n\nFIG. 9: Scaling with L of the half height width of the peak of\nthe order parameter susceptibility for h = \u22120.005.

For h = \u22120.005 there is no\nhope to discern between mean field and 3D Ising (see\nFig. 8).\nA better probe in this case is furnished by the width of\nthe susceptibility peak at half height, which is expected\nto scale like L\u22121/\u03bd , since 1/\u03bd changes appreciably from\nmean field tricritical to 3D Ising (see Table I). Data for\nthe width are shown in Fig. 9: two different regimes are\nvisible, the first for L < 100 regulated by the tricritical\nexponent (\u03bd = 1/2) and the second, for larger lattices,\nwhere this index is sensibly larger, \u03bd = 0.526(3). We\nexplicitly note that this value for \u03bd is to be regarded\njust as an \"effective\", size dependent, index interpolating\nbetween the tricritical (\u03bd = 1/2) and Ising one (\u03bd =\n0.63). That confirms what already found by looking at\nthe scaling of the specific heat.\nLet us summarize and comment the results contained\nin this subsection. Discerning the correct critical behaviour from the finite size scaling analysis of susceptibilities or other quantities may be a difficult task since, as\nexpected, tricritical behavior masks the correct asymptotic scaling behaviour for some range of lattice sizes,\nwhich increases as we get closer to the tricritical field\nhtric according to the tricritical crossover exponents, as\nsummarized in Eq. (10). We have tried to verify quantitatively the prediction reported in Eq. (10) by estimating,\nfor each value of h on the first order side, the critical size\nLc such that for L > Lc the scaling of the maxima of\n\n\f7\nthe specific heat is well described by a first order scaling. Results are reported in Fig. 10: Eq.

Our determinations of \u03b2c are\nsummarized in Table IV and they have been obtained by\nusing the number of phase criterion for first order transitions ([8]), while for the second order ones the crossing\npoint of the order parameter cumulant was used (see e.g.\n[40]).\nWe expect that for large negative values of h the state\ncoupled to the magnetic field disappears from the system\ndynamics, which then becomes completely equivalent to\nthat of a 3D Ising system. That must be visible from the\nbehaviour of \u03b2c (h) which should approach two times3\n\u03b2c (Ising) = 0.2216546(10) ([41]) as h \u2192 \u2212\u221e. In Fig. 16\nwe show the quantity \u03b2c (h) \u2212 2 \u03b2c (Ising), in the regime of\nlarge |h|, which is expected to vanish in the same limit;\nindeed we have verified that the functional behaviour expected from a strong coupling expansion\n\n3\n\nwith b\u03030 = 0.550500(45) b\u03031 = 0.676(44), b\u03032 = 26(13),\nb\u03033 = 2100(1400) and \u03c7\u03032 /d.o.f. = 2.5. We notice that\nb0 gives an estimate of the critical point position of the\nPotts model without external field compatible with the\nknown result \u03b2c (h = 0) = 0.550565(10) obtained in [8]\nand that the slope of \u03b2c (h) at h = 0\u2212 is different from\nthe one observed on the positive h side [9].\nFinally, fitting data for \u03b2c (h) around htric , we can estimate also the temperature location of the tricritical point\nand state (\u03b2tric , htric ) = (0.5480(1), \u22120.00415(3)).\n\n0.04\n\nCritical temperature\n\n\u03b2c (h) \u2212 2\u03b2c (Ising) = b1 eh + b2 e2h + b3 e3h\n\n(18)\n\n0.05\n\nTABLE IV: Estimated values for \u03b2c at fixed h.\n\nC.\n\n\u03b2c (h) = b\u03030 + b\u03031 h + b\u03032 h2 + b\u03033 h3\n\n\u03b2c(h)-2\u03b2c(Ising)\n\nh\n\u22120.0015\n\u22120.002\n\u22120.0025\n\u22120.003\n\u22120.0035\n\u22120.0038\n\u22120.005\n\u22120.01\n\u22120.5\n\u22121.0\n\u22121.5\n\u22122.0\n\nfits our data with b1 = 0.0514(1), b2 = 0.0185(5),\nb3 = 0.0150(5) and \u03c7\u03032 /d.o.f. = 2.8. The agreement is\nreasonable taking into account that our data are very accurate and we truncate the strong coupling series just to\nthird order.\nIn the opposite limit of small values of h, as shown in\nFig. 17, we have been able to fit the \u03b2(h) dependence by\na third order polynomial in h\n\n(17)\n\nThis multiplicative factor is caused by a different normalization\nin the Hamiltonians: the Ising one is usually written as a sum of\nterms \u03b2\u03c3i \u03c3j = \u03b2(2\u03b4\u03c3i \u03c3j \u2212 1).\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-1.5\n\n-0.5\n\nh\nFIG. 16: Plot of \u03b2c (h) \u2212 2\u03b2c (Ising).

In this case the system possesses a residual\nexact symmetry, which gets spontaneously broken at a\ncritical coupling \u03b2c (h), which approaches twice the critical coupling of the 3D Ising model for |h| \u2192 \u221e. In particular, we have determined the tricritical value htric at\nwhich the finite temperature first order transition, taking\nplace for null or small values of |h|, turns into a second\norder transition in the universality class of the 3D Ising\nmodel.\nWe have shown that, in proximity of the tricritical\nfield hcrit , it is difficult to determine the critical behav-\n\n\f10\n0.551\n\n\u03b2c(h)\n\n0.55\n\n0.549\n\n0.548\n\n0.547\n\n-0.005\n\n-0.004\n\n-0.003\n\n-0.002\n\n-0.001\n\n0\n\nh\nFIG. 17: Plot of \u03b2c (h). The line is the result of a fit with the\nfunction in Eq. 18. The point at h = 0 is the result of [8] and\nis not included in the fit. The (red in color) spot on the fitted\nline corresponds to our location of the tricritical point.\n\nalso showed that the order parameter cumulant is another\nvery useful quantity to look at. In this way we have obtained the quite accurate estimate htric = \u22120.00415(3),\nwhich is in agreement with previous determinations reported in Refs. [12, 27]. Although in this work the cumulant method has proved to be the most efficient, which\nof the studied methods is to be preferred to locate a tricritical point should be model dependent.\nOur results may be useful in lattice QCD studies aimed\nat determining the order and universality class of the\nRoberge-Weiss endpoint, and the values of the tricritical\nmasses separating the second order from the first order\nregions both for two [26, 30] and three [27] degenerate\nflavors. In particular we expect that distinguishing the\ncorrect critical behavior on feasible lattice sizes will be increasingly difficult as we approach the tricritical masses,\nthe specific heat being anyway more sensitive than the\norder parameter susceptibility. An accurate determination of the tricritical masses may be based, for instance,\non a careful study of the transition strength as a function\nof h in the first order regions.\n\nior from the finite size scaling of susceptibilities alone,\nsince, at a given distance from hcrit , tricritical scaling\nmasks the correct critical indexes up to a given lattice\nsize Lmax , which is regulated by tricritical crossover exponents (Lmax \u221d |h\u2212htric |\u22121 in our case). A better strategy is to determine parameters which fix the strength of\nthe first order region, like the order parameter gap \u2206 or\nthe latent heat \u2206E , and to determine htric as the value\nof h at which these parameters extrapolate to zero.
