Vanderzande, F. Daerden\nDepartement WNI, Limburgs Universitair Centrum\n3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium\nOctober 27, 2018\n\nAbstract\nWe show that the dissipative Abelian sandpile on a graph L can be related to a\nrandom walk on a graph which consists of L extended with a trapping site. From\nthis relation it can be shown, using exact results and a scaling assumption, that the\ndissipative sandpiles' correlation length exponent \u03bd always equals 1/dw , where dw is\nthe fractal dimension of the random walker. This leads to a new understanding of the\nknown result that \u03bd = 1/2 on any Euclidean lattice. Our result is however more general\nand as an example we also present exact data for finite Sierpinski gaskets which fully\nconfirm our predictions.\n\n1\n\n\fSelf organised criticality (SOC) [1, 2] is the phenomenon in which a slowly driven system with\nmany interacting degrees of freedom evolves spontaneously into a critical state, characterised\nby long range correlations in space and time (for introductory reviews, see [3, 4]). This\nphenomenon has by now been recognised (or conjectured to exist) in many (models of)\nnatural phenomena such as earthquakes [5], forest fires [6], speciation of life [7],. . . Moreover,\nthe possible presence of SOC can be investigated in experimentally controlable phenomena\nsuch as the Barkhausen effect [8], rice piles [9], and so on.\nA question which is however still poorly understood is what precisely are the necessary\ningredients a system (or a model) must have for it to become self-organised critical. For\nexample, one may ask whether or not dissipation of 'energy' (or a similar quantity) destroys\nlong range correlations. This problem has been studied extensively in the Olami-FederChristensen (OFC) model of earthquakes [5]. Numerical studies originally seemed to show\nconvincingly that even in the presence of a small amount of dissipation the model remains\ncritical [10]. Later, it was shown exactly that at least in mean field, the OFC model is only\ncritical when its energy is conserved [11]. Most recently it was argued on the basis of a study\nof branching rates, that the same is true on a finite dimensional lattice [12].\nThe situation is less controversial for sandpile models which form the paradigmatic examples\nof systems showing SOC. In the past decade much progress has been made in the theoretical\nunderstanding of these type of models. This is especially true for the Abelian model [1, 2],\nwhere, following the original work of Dhar [13], a mathematical formalism was developped\n[10\u201314] that allows an exact calculation of several properties of the model such as height\nprobabilities [14, 15], the upper critical dimension [18] and so on.\nThe role of conservation (of sand) in sandpile models was first studied numerically by Ghaffari\net al. [19], who found that any amount of dissipation destroys the presence of SOC in the\nmodel. Recently, it was proven that indeed on any hypercubic lattice a non-conservative\nAbelian sandpile model is not critical [20]. There exist therefore a correlation length \u03be in the\nsystem which diverges when the dissipation rate goes to zero. This allows the introduction of\nan exponent \u03bd which describes this divergence. Numerically [19] it was found that \u03bd \u2248 1/2\nin d = 2. The same authors argued on the basis of a renormalisation group calculation that\n\u03bd = 1/2 on any Euclidean lattice. This result was recently proven exactly [21].\nIn this paper we study further the Abelian sandpile model with dissipation. We begin by\nshowing that this problem can be related to that of a suitably defined random walker on\na lattice with a trap. This result is quite general and extends an earlier mapping between\nconservative sandpiles and resistor networks (or equivalently the q \u2192 0 Potts model) [14].\nIndeed, we will show that sending the dissipation to zero is equivalent to taking the long\ntime limit of the random walk problem. It therefore comes as no surprise that the (sandpile)\ncorrelation length exponent \u03bd can be related to the exponent 1/dw which describes the\nasymptotic behaviour of the random walker. Our result implies that \u03bd = 1/2 for any\nEuclidean lattice. We thus recover in this situation the conclusion of [19, 21] but add a new\nunderstanding of it. However our prediction is more general and holds also on, for example,\n2\n\n\ffractal lattices, or for certain types of random sandpiles. As an example, we performed\ncalculations on the Sierpinski gasket for which dw is known exactly (dw = log 5/ log 2). Our\ndata are consistent with the prediction \u03bd = 1/dw .\nThe Abelian sandpile model on an arbitrary graph L (with N vertices) is defined as follows.\nOn each vertex i of the graph, there exists a height variable zi which assumes integer values\nand has the interpretation of energy or number of sand grains at site i. The dynamics of the\nmodel consists of two steps. First, we choose any site i at random, and add one grain of sand\nto that site, i.e. zi \u2192 zi + 1. When at a given site i, the height of sand exceeds a threshold\nzic , i.e. for zi > zic , we say that that site becomes unstable and then the grains of sand on\ni are distributed among neighbouring sites. This process, called toppling, is specified by a\nmatrix \u2206ij such that\nzj \u2192 zj \u2212 \u2206ij\n\n(1)\n\nThe elements \u2206ij satisfy \u2206ii > 0 and \u2206ij \u2264 0 when i 6= j, and the condition j \u2206ij \u2265 0\nwhich garantees that no sand is created in the toppling process. We will also limit ourselves\nto cases in which \u2206 is symmetric. Through toppling, neighbouring sites can become unstable\nand in this way an avalanche of topplings is generated. A new grain of sand is added only\nwhen the avalanche is over, i.e. all sites are stable again. Finally, grains of sand can leave the\nsystem through certain boundary sites. These are necessary for the model to reach a steady\nstate asymptotically. The number of topplings in a given avalanche s is a random variable\nwhose distribution P (s, N) is now known to have rich, multifractal properties [22]. In the\npresent paper we will however only be interested in the first moment hsi of this distribution.\nAn exact expression for this quantity can be obtained as follows [13]. One first introduces\nthe matrix G, which is the inverse of \u2206. The element Gij can be interpreted as the expected\nnumber of topplings at site j when a grain of sand has been dropped at site i [13]. From\nthis interpretation one obtains\nP\n\nhsi =\n\n1 XX\nGij\nN i\u2208L j\u2208L\n\n(2)\n\nOne of the results of this paper will be a scaling expression for hsi for the dissipative sandpile\nmodel.\nTo continue we will reason further with the case of a graph where each site (apart from\nthe boundary sites) is connected to a fixed number of neighbours z. We take zic = z, \u2200i.\nFor example, on the square lattice or on the Sierpinski gasket z = 4. In the case of the\nconservative sandpile model we choose the matrix \u2206 as\n\u2206ci,j =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nz\nif i = j\n\u22121 i and j are neighbours\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\notherwise\n\n(3)\n\n(in the rest of this paper a superscript c (resp. d) will refer to the conservative (resp.\ndissipative) case). On the other hand, following Tsuchiya and Katori [20] , we choose in the\n3\n\n\fcase of a dissipative sandpile model\n\u2206di,j\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nz\u03b3\u03b6 if i = j\n= \u2212\u03b6 i and j are neighbours\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\notherwise\n\n(4)\n\nwith \u03b3 > 1. In this way, at each toppling \u03b6z(\u03b3 \u2212 1) grains of sand disappear.\nWith each toppling matrix \u2206ij we can associate a random walk problem. To do this we have\nto extend the graph L with one extra site, denoted as T which, as we will see immediately,\nwill get the properties of a trap for the random walker. Let L\u22c6 = L \u222a T . We then define\na continuous time random walker on L\u22c6 using the matrix elements \u2206ij as transition rates.\nMore concrete, the rate by which the walker jumps from j to i is given by \u2212\u2206ij for any two\nP\nsites on L. Secondly, the walker jumps from a site j \u2208 L to the trap T with rate \u03c6j = i \u2206ij .\nOnce the walker reaches T , it stays there forever.\nLet P (i, k, t) be the conditional probability that the walker is at site i \u2208 L\u22c6 at time t given\nthat he was in k at t = 0. This conditional probability then evolves according to the master\nequation\n\u1e56 (i, k, t) = \u2212\n\nX\n\nDij P (j, k, t)\n\n(5)\n\nj\n\nwhere\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n\u2206ij i \u2208 L, j \u2208 L, i 6= j\nDij = \u2212\u03c6j i = T, j \u2208 L\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\nif j = T\n\n(6)\n\nFor the diagonal elements we take\nDjj = \u2212\n\nX\n\nX\n\nDij = \u2212\n\ni\u2208L\u22c6 ,i6=j\n\n\u2206ij + \u03c6j = \u2206jj\n\ni\u2208L,i6=j\n\nIn this way, and because of the conditions we put on the matrix \u2206, D has all the necessary\nproperties (see e.g. [23]) of a stochastic matrix.\nTo solve the master equation (5), it is common ([23]) to introduce the Green function Gik (s)\nwhich is the Laplace transform of P (i, k, t)\nGik (s) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nP (i, k, t)e\u2212st dt\n\n(7)\n\nThe Green function obeys the linear equation\n\u03b4ik \u2212 sGik (s) =\n\nX\n\nDij Gjk (s)\n\nj\n\nwhose formal solution is\n1\nGik (s) =\ns.1 + D\n\u0012\n\n4\n\n\u0013\n\nik\n\n(8)\n\n\fThis solution can be written in terms of the eigenvalues \u03bb\u03b1 and associated eigenvectors u\u03b1\nof D as\nX\n1\nGik (s) =\n(u\u03b1 )i (u\u03b1 )k\n(9)\n\u03b1 (s + \u03bb\u03b1 )\nNotice that because of the structure (6), the spectrum of the matrix consists of the spectrum\nof \u2206 and one zero eigenvalue, which we will denote as \u03bb0 . The eigenvector associated with\nthis zero eigenvalue is completely concentrated on the trap, (u0 )i = \u03b4i,T . On the other\nhand, for the eigenvectors associated with the other eigenvalues, we have (u\u03b1 )T = 0, \u03b1 6= 0.\nTherefore (9) becomes\n1\nGik (s) = \u03b4i,T \u03b4k,T + G\u0303ik (s)\ns\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\nG\u0303ik (s) =\n\n1\n(u\u03b1 )i (u\u03b1 )k\n\u03b16=0 (s + \u03bb\u03b1 )\nX\n\n(11)\n\nWe can therefore relate the matrix elements Gij appearing in (2) to the elements of the\nGreen function as\nGij = G\u0303ij (s = 0)\n\n(12)\n\nWe now have all the necessary ingredients to discuss the dissipative sandpiles whose toppling\nmatrix is given in (4). Comparing (3) with (4) , we immediately see that\n\u2206dij = \u03b6\u2206cij + z\u03b6(\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u03b4ij\n\n(13)\n\nThis simple relation implies that the eigenvectors of \u2206d and \u2206c are the same and that their\neigenvalues are trivially related by a multiplicative and an additive constant. Therefore we\nget for the inverse of \u2206dij using (12) and the general definition (11)\n1\nGdij = G\u0303dij (s = 0) = G\u0303cij (s = z(\u03b3 \u2212 1))\n\u03b6\n\n(14)\n\nThis is our main result. It shows the relation between the dissipative sandpile model and the\nrandom walker associated with the conservative sandpile model but at s = z(\u03b3 \u2212 1). Taking\nthe conservative limit \u03b3 \u2192 1 then corresponds precisely to taking the limit t \u2192 \u221e in the\nrandom walk problem. Since that asymptotic limit is determined by the scaling exponent\ndw of the random walk, it can already be expected that the correlation length exponent \u03bd is\nrelated to dw .\nThe precise connection between the two exponents can be obtained as follows. We will\ncalculate hsi as given in (2) for the dissipative sandpile defined in (4). Summing over i,\nusing (14) and (7) we get\nX\ni\u2208L\n\nGdik\n\n1\n=\n\u03b6\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nP0c (k, t)e\u2212z(\u03b3\u22121)t dt\n5\n\n(15)\n\n\fwhere P0c (k, t) = i\u2208L P (i, k, t) is the probability that the walker that started at k has not\nyet been trapped at time t. To calculate P0c (k, t) it is important to first consider the type of\nrandom walk that we have to investigate. Because of the relation (14), we have to work with\nthe random walker associated with the matrix \u2206c of the conservative sandpile. The resulting\nrandom walker is therefore such that only boundary sites, which in the conservative case are\nthe only ones where sand leaves the system, are connected with the trap. Random walks\nof this type, at least on an Euclidean lattice are easy to study. We will come back to that\nbelow.\nP\n\nFirst, we consider however the limit N \u2192 \u221e. In that limit a random walker starting on\na typical site will not be trapped for any finite t, since only the boundary sites at infinity\nare connected with the trap. Therefore, one has P0c (k, t) = 1. Then the integral in (15) can\nimmediately be performed and since the result does not depend on k we get\nhsi =\n\n1\n\u03b6z(\u03b3 \u2212 1)\n\n(16)\n\nThis relation was first derived on the d = 2 square lattice in [20] but we now see that it is\nquite general. In fact, it shows that the dissipative sandpile is never critical.\nWe now turn back to the case that the number of sites on the graph is finite, in which\ncase P0c (k, t) will be a decreasing function of time. Explicit results for this quantity can be\nobtained on Euclidean lattices with elementary Fourier techniques. In one dimension one\nobtains for example\nP0c (k, t)\nh\n\nL X\nL\nn\u03c0k\nn\u03c0j\n2 X\ne\u2212\u03c9n t sin\nsin\n=\nL + 1 j=1 n=1\nL+1\nL+1\n\n!\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(17)\n\ni\n\nn\u03c0\nwhere \u03c9n = 2 1 \u2212 cos( L+1\n) . Similar results can easily be obtained in higher dimensions. In\nthe saling limit, L \u2192 \u221e, t \u2192 \u221e, it is easy to see that this probability is of the form\n\nP0c (k, t) \u2248\n\n1 k t\nF( , )\nL L L2\n\n(18)\n\nOn any Euclidean lattice, the fractal dimension dw of the type of random walker that we\nconsider here equals 2. On the basis of exact results such as (18), and on general physical\nintuition it can be expected that for the random walkers which are connected with the trap\nonly through some boundary sites, P0c (k, t) has in general the following scaling behaviour\nP0c (k, t) \u2248\n\n1\nk t\nH(\n,\n)\nd\nLf\nL Ldw\n\n(19)\n\nwith H some scaling function. Here df is the (fractal) dimension of the graph.\nAfter inserting (19) in (15), making a suitable change of variables, and also performing the\nresulting sum over k we finally get the following scaling form for hsi\nhsi \u223c Ldw R(L(\u03b3 \u2212 1)1/dw )\n6\n\n(20)\n\n\f0.02\n\n<s>L L-dw\n\n0.015\n\n0.01\n\n0.005\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nL (\u03b3 -1)(1/dw)\n\nFigure 1: Plot of hsiL\u2212dw versus L(\u03b3 \u2212 1)1/dw for the non conservative sandpile model on\nthe Sierpinski gasket with L = 2, 4, . . . , 128, and different values of \u03b3.\nwhere R is a scaling function.\nFrom (20), we see that for the conservative case, \u03b3 = 1, and on an Euclidean lattice hsi \u223c L2\nwhich is an old result obtained by Dhar [13]. For \u03b3 > 1, we conclude from (20) that the\nexponent \u03bd that the describes the crossover between dissipative and conservative sandpiles\nequals 1/dw .\nOn an Euclidean lattice, we recover in this way a result first determined with an approximate\nrenormalisation technique [19] and recently obtained exactly [21]. Our result (20) is however\nmuch more general. The relation \u03bd = 1/dw should also hold on, e.g. fractal lattices. As\nan example, we checked this scaling on finite Sierpinski gasket. In particular, we considered\nSierpinski gaskets of n generations with n \u2264 7. For each of these we calculated the matrix Gdij\nby calculating the inverse of \u2206dij using a computer. This we did for several values of \u03b3. From\nGd we then calculated hsi using (2). Finally, we plotted hsiL\u2212dw versus L(\u03b3 \u2212 1)1/dw . These\nnumerically exact results are shown in figure 1. For the Sierpinski gasket dw = log 5/ log 2.\nAs can be seen the agreement with the scaling prediction is excellent. Together with the\nknown result for the square lattice case, these data give very strong support for the conjecture\nthat \u03bd = 1/dw .\nOne may now ask how general our prediction for \u03bd is, and whether one can imagine situations\nin which it does not hold. Besides the scaling assumption (19), the crucial step in the\nderivation is the relation (13) between the conservative and dissipative toppling matrices.\n\n7\n\n\fIn a more general case one may consider a toppling matrix of the form\n\u2206di,j\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nz\u03b3i \u03b6 if i = j\n= \u2212\u03b6 i and j are neighbours\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\notherwise\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03b3i is site dependent (the same would hold for a graph in which the coordination\nnumber is site dependent). Let \u03b3m = mini \u03b3i . For this case (14) gets replaced by\n1\nGdij = G\u0303rij (s = z(\u03b3m \u2212 1))\n\u03b6\nwhere G\u0303r is the Green function of a random walker where from site i one enters the trap with\nrate \u03b6z(\u03b3i \u2212 \u03b3m ). It then depends on the particular values of \u03b3i what is the precise value of\ndw or even whether dw can still be defined in a meaningful way. It is also not clear in which\ncases a scaling assumption such as (19) remains valid. But we expect that for many cases\nthat are of interest from the sandpile point of view, our result will hold, eventually with an\nexponent \u03bd that depends on the particular distribution of \u03b3i values.\nAs an example, take a matrix \u2206dij whose diagonal elements are constructed in the following\nrandom way. With probability p we take \u2206dii = z\u03b6\u03b31 , while with probability 1 \u2212 p we take\n\u2206dii = z\u03b6\u03b32 . In the related random walker, and for \u03b32 > \u03b31 , the sites that are connected\nwith the trap are are randomly distributed over the lattice with probability p. For such a\nrandom walk, it has been shown that in d = 1, dw = 3 [24]. Hence, we expect that for this\nkind of dissipative sandpile \u03bd = 1/3 (instead of 1/2) in d = 1. We are currently verifying\nthis prediction. The results will be published elsewhere.\nIn summary, we have shown how to relate a dissipative sandpile model with an associated\nrandom walker. Using results from the theory of random walks we were then able to show\nthat \u03bd = 1/dw for a large class of non-conservative sandpile models. This result is in\nagreement with the available evidence on Euclidean lattices and on the Sierpinski gasket.\nSince the knowledge on random walks is quite extensive, we suspect that many interesting\nphenomena in dissipative sandpiles can now be obtained using the link with random walks.\nAcknowledgement We would like to thank M.
