Introduction\n1.1. Main results. In this paper we prove that a Hamiltonian difffeomorphism of\na symplectic manifold has infinitely many periodic orbits if the first Chern class of\nthe manifold vanishes over \u03c02 (M ). This is a generalization of a conjecture Conley\nstated in 1984 in [Co] for M = T 2n . This conjecture was proved for the weakly\nnon-degenerate Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of tori in [CZ] and of symplectically\naspherical manifolds in [SZ]. In [FH], the conjecture was proved for all Hamiltonian\ndiffeomorphisms of surfaces other than S 2 . In its original form, as stated in [Co] for\nM = T 2n , the conjecture was established in [Hi] and the case of an arbitrary closed,\nsymplectically aspherical manifold was settled in [Gi]. This proof was extended to\nsymplectically rational manifolds M with c1 (M )|\u03c02 (M ) = 0 in [GG2].\nThe main result of this paper is the following theorem:\nTheorem 1.1 (Conley Conjecture, the irrational case). Let (M 2n , \u03c9) be a closed\nsymplectic manifold with c1 (M )|\u03c02 (M ) = 0 and let \u03c6 be a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism on M such that the fixed points of \u03c6 are isolated. Then \u03c6 has simple periodic\norbits of arbitrarily large period.\nIn particular, this theorem implies all the results mentioned above. It also implies that on such manifolds any Hamiltonian diffeomorphism has infinitely many\nperiodic orbits as there are infinitely many one-periodic orbits or we have simple\nperiodic orbits of arbitrarily large period.\nRemark 1.2. The requirements on the manifold for theorems of this type have been\nrelaxed more and more in the last years. However, the example of an irrational\nrotation on S 2 shows that the restrictions on the symplectic manifold cannot be\ncompletely eliminated.\nAs in [GG2], it suffices to prove the result in the presence of a symplectically\ndegenerate maximum.\nDefinition 1.3. An isolated capped k-periodic orbit x\u0304 of a k-periodic Hamiltonian\nH is called a symplectically degenerate maximum of H if\n\u2206H (x\u0304) = 0 and HFn (H, x\u0304) 6= 0.\nIn this definition, we denote by HFn (H, x\u0304) the local Floer homology of H at x\u0304\nand let \u2206H (x\u0304) be the mean index of x\u0304. We refer to [GG3] for details on the local\nFloer homology and to [SZ] for the definition of the mean index.\nThis definition was first used in [Hi] when the concept of symplectically degenerate maxima was introduced. It was explicitly stated and further investigated in\n[Gi, GG3]. See also Proposition 4.2 for the geometric description of a symplectically\ndegenerate maximum.\nTheorem 1.4 (Degenerate Conley Conjecture, the irrational case). Let (M 2n , \u03c9)\nbe a closed symplectic manifold with c1 (M )|\u03c02 (M ) = 0 and let H be a Hamiltonian\non M such that the fixed points of \u03c6H are isolated. Assume, in addition, that H has\na symplectically degenerate maximum. Then the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism \u03c6H\ngenerated by H has geometrically distinct periodic orbits of arbitrarily large period.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. If there is no symplectically degenerate maximum, all oneperiodic orbits have non-zero mean index. As the mean index is independent of\n\n\fCONLEY CONJECTURE FOR IRRATIONAL SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS\n\n3\n\ncappings and grows linearly with iteration, the support of local Floer homology\nis shifting away from the interval [0, 2n], i.e. the local Floer homology in those\ndegrees eventually becomes 0. The theorem follows then by a standard argument\nas in [Gi, GG2, Hi, SZ]. If there is a symplectically degenerate maximum, the\ntheorem follows from Theorem 1.4.\n\u0003\nThe proof of Theorem 1.4 is based on a Floer theoretical argument establishing\nTheorem 1.5. Let (M, \u03c9) be weakly monotone and closed. Assume that H has\na symplectically degenerate maximum at x\u0304 with AH (x\u0304) = c. Then for every sufficiently small \u000f > 0 there exists some k\u000f such that\n(kc+\u03b4k , kc+\u000f)\n\nHFn+1\n\n(H (k) ) 6= 0 for every k > k\u000f and some \u03b4k \u2208 (0, \u000f).\n\nHere H (k) denotes the one-periodic Hamiltonian H viewed as k-periodic function\nfor some integer k, see also Section 2.1. This theorem implies Theorem 1.4 and thus\nalso Theorem 1.1.\nProof of Theorem 1.4. Arguing by contradiction, we assume that for every sufficiently large period all periodic orbits are iterated and let k be a sufficiently large\nprime. Then every k-periodic orbit is an iterated one-periodic orbit. By Theorem 1.5, there exists a capped k-periodic orbit \u0233k with\n1 \u2264 \u2206H (k) (\u0233k ) \u2264 2n + 1.\nWe only have finitely many one-periodic orbits and c1 (M )|\u03c02 (M ) = 0. The finitely\nmany non-zero mean indices grow linearly with the order of iteration and thus\nfor sufficiently large k the indices of the iterations shift away from the interval\n[1, 2n + 1]. The iterations of the orbits with mean index zero have also mean index\nzero. Thus the orbit \u0233k cannot be an iterated one-periodic orbit in contradiction\nto the choice of k.\n\u0003\nThe proof of Theorem 1.5 builds on a generalization of the methods from the\nproof of the rational case in [GG2]. We define filtered Floer homology for symplectically irrational manifolds and prove that this homology can be localized for\nsufficiently small action intervals. The localization is realized by a direct sum decomposition for the filtered Floer homology groups similar to the one existing in\nthe rational case. To this end, we use ideas from [Us] to bound the energy of Floer\ntrajectories.\n1.2. Action and index gap. Theorem 1.5 can also be sed to control the behavior\nof actions and mean indices of periodic orbits, cf. [GG2]. To state the results, we\nneed to introduce some notation. We call the difference AH (k) (x\u0304) \u2212 AH (k) (\u0233) the\naction gap between the two capped k-periodic orbits x\u0304 and \u0233. Similarly, the mean\nindex gap between the two orbits is the difference \u2206H (k) (x\u0304)\u2212\u2206H (k) (\u0233). Both can be\nzero, even for geometrically distinct orbits x and y. The action-index gap between\nx\u0304 and \u0233 is the vector in R2 whose components are the action gap and the mean\nindex gap.\nRecall also that an increasing sequence of integers \u03bd1 < \u03bd2 < . . . is called quasiarithmetic if the differences \u03bdi+1 \u2212 \u03bdi are bounded by a constant, which is independent of i.\n\n\f4\n\nDORIS HEIN\n\nTheorem 1.6 (Bounded gap theorem). Let H be a Hamiltonian on a closed symplectic manifold (M 2n , \u03c9) with N \u2265 2n such that all periodic orbits of \u03c6H are\nisolated.\nThen there exists a capped one-periodic orbit x\u0304 of H, a quasi-arithmetic sequence\nof iterations \u03bdi , and a sequence of capped \u03bdi -periodic orbits \u0233i , geometrically distinct\nfrom x\u0304\u03bdi , such that the sequence of action\u2013index gaps\n(AH (\u03bdi ) (x\u0304\u03bdi ) \u2212 AH (\u03bdi ) (\u0233i ), \u2206H (\u03bdi ) (x\u0304\u03bdi ) \u2212 \u2206H (\u03bdi ) (\u0233i ))\nis bounded.\nThis is a generalization of a result in [GG2] where the theorem was proved in\nthe case of a symplectically rational manifold. The proof of the present version\nfollows the same path as the argument in [GG2], utilizing the general form of\nTheorem 1.5. The new point is that we now use the mean index bound, rather\nthan the action bound as in [GG2], to show that the orbits \u0233i and the iterations\nof x\u0304 are geometrically distinct. As in the rational case, this theorem implies the\nfollowing corollary in the generalized situation.\nCorollary 1.7. Let M and H be as in Theorem 1.6. Then there exists a quasiarithmetic sequence of iterations \u03bdi and sequences of geometrically distinct \u03bdi periodic orbits z\u0304i and z\u0304i0 such that the sequence of action\u2013index gaps between z\u0304i\nand z\u0304i0 is bounded.\n1.3. Organization of the paper. In Sections 2.1 and 2.2 we set the notation and\nconventions used in this paper. Section 2.3 is devoted to the discussion of the construction of filtered Floer homology. In particular, we focus on the construction of\nfiltered Floer homology that is necessary for degenerate Hamiltonians on irrational\nsymplectic manifolds. In Section 3 we establish a localization of Floer homology\nvia a direct sum decomposition in filtered Floer homology. Finally, we prove Theorem 1.5 in Section 4 using the direct sum decomposition from Proposition 3.1.\n1.4. Acknowledgments. The author is deeply grateful to Viktor Ginzburg for\nshowing her this problem, helping with the solution and his kind, thoughtful advice.\nShe would also like to thank the referee for useful remarks and Katrin Wehrheim\nfor useful discussions.\n2. Preliminaries\nIn this section we will set the notation used in this paper and review some of the\nbasic facts needed in order to prove the theorems.\n2.1. Symplectic manifolds and Hamitonian flows. Let (M 2n , \u03c9) be a closed\nsymplectic manifold of dimension 2n with first Chern class c1 (M ) and the minimal\nChern number N . Throughout the paper we assume (M, \u03c9) to be weakly monotone,\ni.e. N \u2265 n \u2212 2 or [\u03c9] |\u03c02 (M ) = \u03bbc1 (M )|\u03c02 (M ) for some non-negative constant \u03bb. In\nparticular we will focuss on the first case as in the latter case the manifold is rational\nand the theorems are already proved in [GG2].\nAll considered Hamiltonians H on M are assumed to be one-periodic in time,\ni.e. functions H : S 1 \u00d7 M \u2192 R where S 1 = R/Z and we will set Ht (x) = H(t, x). A\none-periodic Hamiltonian H can also be viewed as k-periodic for any integer k. For\nour argument it is sometimes crucial to keep track of the period we are interested\n\n\fCONLEY CONJECTURE FOR IRRATIONAL SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS\n\n5\n\nin. If a one-periodic Hamiltonian H is viewed as k-periodic, we refer to it as the\nkth iteration of H and denote it by H (k) .\nAs the symplectic form \u03c9 is non-degenerate, the Hamiltonian equation iXH \u03c9 =\n\u2212dH gives rise to a well-defined Hamiltonian vector field XH . The time-1-map of\nthe flow of the Hamiltonian vector field XH is called a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism\nand denoted by \u03c6H .\nThe composition \u03c6tH \u25e6 \u03c6tK of two Hamiltonian flows is again Hamiltonian. It is\ngenerated by\n(K#H)t = Kt + Ht \u25e6 \u03c6\u2212t\nK .\nIn general, this function need not be one-periodic, even if both H and K are oneperiodic Hamiltonians. But K#H will be one-periodic if both are one-periodic and\nin addition K generates a loop of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. This will always\nbe the case in this paper.\n2.2. Capped periodic orbits and Floer homology. Let x : S 1 \u2192 M be a\ncontractible loop. A capping of x is defined to be a map u : D2 \u2192 M such that\nu|S 1 = x. Two cappings are called equivalent if the integrals over the symplectic\nform \u03c9 and the first Chern class c1 (M ) over the two capping discs agree. We denote\nthe pair (x, [u]) of a loop x with an equivalence class of cappings [u] by x\u0304. In the\nsymplectically aspherical case, all cappings are equivalent.\n2.2.1. Hamiltonian action and the mean index. The Hamiltonian action functional\nis defined by\nZ\nZ\nAH (x\u0304) = \u2212 \u03c9 +\nHt (x(t)) dt\nu\n\nS1\n\non the space of capped closed loops. This space is a covering space of the space\nof contractible loops and the critical points of the action functional are exactly the\ncapped one-periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian vector field XH . The set of critical\nvalues of the action is denoted by S(H) and called the action spectrum of H.\nIn this paper we only work with contractible periodic orbits and every periodic\norbit is assumed to be contractible, even if this is not explicitly stated.\nA one-periodic orbit x of H is said to be non-degenerate if the linearized return\nmap d\u03c6H : Tx(0) M \u2192 Tx(0) M does not have one as an eigenvalue. Following [SZ],\nwe call an orbit weakly non-degenerate if at least one eigenvalue is not equal to one\nand strongly degenerate otherwise. We refer to a Hamiltonian H as non-degenerate,\nif all its one-periodic orbits are non-degenerate.\nIn general, the mean index and the action depend on the equivalence class of\nthe capping u of the loop x. More concretely let A be an embedded 2-sphere and\ndenote by x\u0304#A the recapping of x\u0304 by attaching A. Then we have\nZ\nAH (x\u0304#A) = AH (x\u0304) \u2212\n\u03c9\nA\n\nby the above formula for the Hamiltonian action. For the definition and properties\nof the mean index we refer the reader to [SZ]. A list of properties of the mean\nindex can also be found in [GG2]. Here we only mention that the mean index \u2206(x\u0304)\ndepends on the capping via\n\u2206(x\u0304#A) = \u2206(x\u0304) \u2212 2c1 (A).\n\n\f6\n\nDORIS HEIN\n\nThe kth iteration of a capped orbit x\u0304 carries a natural capping and with that\ncapping it is denoted by x\u0304k . The mean index and the action both are homogeneous\nwith respect to iteration and satisfy the iteration formulas\nAH (k) (x\u0304k ) = kAH (x\u0304) and \u2206H (k) (x\u0304k ) = k\u2206H (x\u0304).\n2.2.2. Floer homology. Up to sign we define the Conley-Zehnder index as in [Sa,\nSZ] and use the normalization such that for a non-degenerate maximum \u03b3 of an\nautonomous Hamiltonian with small Hessian we have \u03bcCZ (\u03b3) = n; see [GG2].\nWe define the Floer homology for a non-degenerate Hamiltonian H as in [Sa, SZ].\nThe homology is graded by the Conley-Zehnder index. The Floer chain groups are\ngenerated by the capped one-periodic orbits of H and the boundary operator is\ndefined by counting solutions to the Floer equation\n\u2202u\n\u2202u\n+ Jt (u)\n= \u2212\u2207Ht (u)\n(2.1)\n\u2202s\n\u2202t\nwith finite energy. As is well known, Floer trajectories for a non-degenerate Hamiltonian H with finite energy converge to periodic orbits x\u0304 and \u0233 as s goes to \u00b1\u221e\nand satisfy\nZ \u221eZ\n2\n\u2202u\nE(u) = AH (x\u0304) \u2212 AH (\u0233) =\ndt ds.\n\u2212\u221e S 1 \u2202s\nThe boundary operator counts Floer trajectories converging to periodic orbits y\nand x as s \u2192 \u00b1\u221e and satisfying the condition [(capping of x\u0304)#u] = [capping of \u0233].\nThis construction extends by continuity from non-degenerate Hamiltonians to all\nHamiltonians, see [Sa].\nFor two non-degenerate Hamiltonians H 0 and H 1 , a homotopy from H 0 to H 1\ninduces a homomorphism of chain complexes which gives an isomorphism between\nthe Floer homologies HF\u2217 (H 0 ) and HF\u2217 (H 1 ) which is independent of the choice of\nhomotopy. This map is defined analogously to the Floer boundary operator using\na version of the Floer equation with the homotopy H s on the right hand side.\nThe local Floer homology HF\u2217 (H, x\u0304) of a Hamiltonian H at a capped one-periodic\norbit x\u0304 is also defined as usual, see [Gi, GG2, GG3]. As the action does not enter\nthe argument, the definition goes through in the irrational case. It is constructed\nusing a small non-degenerate perturbation of the Hamiltonian in a neighborhood\nof x. For a more detailed definition and a discussion of the properties of local Floer\nhomology see [Gi, GG2, GG3].\n2.3. Filtered Floer Homology. In this section, we give a definition of filtered\nFloer homology for degenerate Hamiltonians on symplectically irrational manifolds.\nAs the action decreases along Floer trajectories of a non-degenerate Hamiltonian\nH, we also have well-defined chain complexes that only involve orbits with action\nin an interval (a, b) if a and b are not in the action spectrum S(H). This complex\nb)\ngives rise to the filtered Floer homology HF(a,\n(H). This construction extends\n\u2217\nby continuity to degenerate Hamiltonians if the manifold is rational, since in this\ncase the Floer homology is independent of the choice of a sufficiently small, nondegenerate perturbation.\nIn the case of an irrational manifold, the action filtration of Floer homology for\ndegenerate Hamitonians cannot be unambigously defined simply by continuity as\nthe resulting groups depend very sensitively on the non-degenerate perturbation.\n\n\fCONLEY CONJECTURE FOR IRRATIONAL SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS\n\n7\n\nWe thus use the following construction for the filtered Floer homology, which in\nthe case of a rational manifold gives the same homology groups as continuity:\nb)\nLet H be a fixed Hamiltonian on M . To define HF(a,\n(H), consider perturba\u2217\ntions K of H with the following properties:\n(P1) the Hamiltonian K is non-degenerate;\n(P2) the boundary values a and b of the action interval are not in the action\nspectrum S(K) of K;\n(P3) we have K \u2265 H.\nFor the remaining part of this section we will always assume the above properties\nwhenever we speak of perturbations K of a Hamiltonian H.\nThe set of such perturbations is partially ordered by K 1 \u2264 K 0 whenever Kt1 (x) \u2264\n0\nKt (x) for all x \u2208 M and t \u2208 S 1 . Consider a monotone decreasing homotopy K s\nfrom K 0 to K 1 . By condition (P1), both perturbations K 0 and K 1 are nondegenerate. Thus we have an induced monotone homotopy map between the Floer\nhomology groups, which are well-defined by (P1) and (P2). In this case, this map\nis still a homomorphism, but it needs not be an isomorphism. Those monotone\nhomotopy maps give rise to transition maps HF\u2217(a, b) (K) \u2192 HF\u2217(a, b) (K\u0303) whenever\nK \u2265 K\u0303. Then we can define the filtered Floer homology of H by\nb)\n(H) = lim HF\u2217(a, b) (K)\nHF(a,\n\u2217\n\u2212\u2192\n\nas the direct limit of homology groups.\nRemark 2.1. If H is non-degenerate and a and b are not in the action spectrum\nS(H), this definition gives the ordinary filtered Floer homology of H, as H can be\nviewed as the trivial perturbation of itself and thus as the smallest of all considered\nperturbations K.\nBy construction of filtered Floer homology for non-degenerate Hamiltonians, we\nhave a long exact sequence of filtered Floer homology groups\n(a, b)\n\nb)\nc)\nc)\n* * * \u2192 HF(a,\n(K) \u2192 HF(a,\n(K) \u2192 HF(b,\n(K) \u2192 HF\u2217\u22121 (K) \u2192 * * *\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nfor any non-degenerate Hamiltonian K with a, b, c \u2208\n/ S(K). The maps of this exact\nsequence commute with the monotone homotopy map. Then, for the limit function\nH, the analog sequence\n(a, b)\n\nb)\nc)\nc)\n* * * \u2192 HF(a,\n(H) \u2192 HF(a,\n(H) \u2192 HF(b,\n(H) \u2192 HF\u2217\u22121 (H) \u2192 * * *\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nis also exact. This can be proved by a standard diagram chasing argument using\nthe commutativity and the definition of the limit groups.\nIn the definition of the filtered Floer homology as a limit, we can also restrict\nthe family of perturbations by requiring other properties in addition to (P1)-(P3).\nThe restricted family of perturbations is sufficient to define the limit if they form a\ncofinal set, i.e. for any perturbation satisfying (P1)-(P3) we can find a smaller one\nwith the additional properties. The limit then does not depend on the perturbations\nthat do not have the additional properties.\nIn particular, we will later consider a cofinal set of perturbations for which the\nfiltered Floer homology splits into a direct sum decomposition that is compatible\nwith the monotone homotopy maps. Then we also have a direct sum decomposition\nof the limit.\n\n\f8\n\nDORIS HEIN\n\nWe can also define monotone homotopy maps for homotopies starting from H.\nDue to condition (P3), the monotone homotopy map for a homotopy starting from\nany perturbation K factors through all perturbations closer to the limit function\nH than K. Then we define the monotone homotopy map from HF(a,b) (H) as the\nlimit of monotone homotopy maps from the perturbations. The resulting map, still\ncalled monotone homotopy map, has the same properties as the usual homotopy\nmaps.\n3. Direct sum decomposition in filtered Floer homology\n3.1. The direct sum decomposition. In this section, we prove the existence\nof a direct sum decomposition of filtered Floer homology for short action intervals. This decomposition enables us to restrict our attention to the behavior of the\nHamiltonian on a fixed open set.\nTo construct this direct sum decomposition, let K be a non-degenerate Hamiltonian on M . Consider two open sets U and V such that U \u2282 V and both sets are\nbounded by level sets of K. On the shell V\u0304 \\ U , assume that the Hamiltonian K is\nautonomous and does not have one-periodic orbits. In particular, this implies that\nU and V are homotopy equivalent. Also fix an almost complex structure J on M ,\nwhich is compatible with \u03c9.\nConsider the splitting of Floer chain groups into the direct sum\nb)\n(K) = CF\u2217(a, b) (K, U ) \u2295 CF\u2217(a, b) (K; M, U ),\nCF(a,\n\u2217\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere the first summand is generated by the one-periodic orbits in U with capping\nequivalent to a capping contained in U . The second summand is spanned by all the\nremaining capped orbits.\nProposition 3.1. Let the Hamiltonian K and the open sets U and V be as above.\nThere exists an \u000f > 0, depending only on J, the open sets U and V and on K|V \\U\nsuch that (3.1) gives rise to a direct sum decomposition of homology\nb)\nb)\nHF(a,\n(K) = HF\u2217(a, b) (K, U ) \u2295 HF(a,\n(K; M, U )\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhenever the action interval (a, b) is chosen such that b \u2212 a < \u000f.\nTo prove this, we need to show that for such Hamiltonians K no Floer trajectory\ncan connect orbits from different summands, if the action interval is sufficiently\nsmall. The key to that is proving the following proposition which provides a lower\nbound on the energy for those Floer trajectories.\nProposition 3.2. Let K be a non-degenerate Hamiltonian and let U and V be\nopen sets that are both bounded by level sets of K. Assume furthermore that K\ndoes not have one-periodic orbits in V\u0304 \\ U and is autonomous on this shell. Let\nu : S 1 \u00d7 R \u2192 M be a Floer trajectory that intersects \u2202U and \u2202V . Then there is\na constant \u000f > 0, only depending on the open sets U and V , the restriction of the\nHamiltonian K and the almost complex structure J to V\u0304 \\ U , such that E(u) > \u000f.\nb)\nProof of Proposition 3.1. Let x\u0304 and \u0233 be two capped orbits in HF(a,\n(K). Assume\n\u2217\nb)\nthat x\u0304 and \u0233 are connected by a Floer trajectory u, and let x\u0304 be in HF(a,\n(K, U ).\n\u2217\nWe need to show that y is contained in U and the capping of \u0233 is equivalent to a\ncapping in U .\nBy construction, V is homotopy equivalent to U and the capping of \u0233 is equivalent to u#(the capping of x\u0304). Thus it suffices to show that the Floer trajectory\n\n\fCONLEY CONJECTURE FOR IRRATIONAL SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS\n\n9\n\nu is contained in V . If u did leave V , it would have to intersect both boundary\ncomponents of V \\ U , as u is converging to the orbit x, which is contained in U .\nBy Proposition 3.2, such a trajectory would have to have energy E(u) > \u000f for some\nconstant \u000f > 0. Thus, if we choose the action interval (a, b) such that b \u2212 a is\nsmaller than the lower bound \u000f in Proposition 3.2, the Floer trajectory u has to be\ncontained in V and we have the desired direct sum in homology.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.3. In general, the direct sum decomposition from Proposition 3.1 need not\nbe compatible with monotone homotopy maps. In some important cases, however,\nthis is the case. For example, consider two Hamiltonians K 1 and K 2 that agree\non V \\ U up to a constant and assume K 1 \u2265 K 2 . Then the above direct sum\ndecomposition is compatible with the monotone homotopy map HF\u2217(a, b) (K 1 ) \u2192\nb)\nHF(a,\n(K 2 ). Indeed, the monotone homotopy map is defined using a version of the\n\u2217\nFloer equation. If the two Hamiltonians agree up to a constant, their Hamiltonian\nvector fields agree and this equation is exactly the standard Floer equation. Thus\nthe above proof of Proposition 3.1 also applies in this setting and shows that the\nmonotone homotopy map is compatible with the direct sum decomposition for\nsufficiently small action intervals.\nCorollary 3.4. Let K be any Hamiltonian, not necessarily non-degenerate. Assume that the open sets U and V are bounded by level sets of K. If the Hamiltonian\nK is autonomous on V \\ U and does not have periodic orbits in this shell, then for\nsufficiently small action interval (a, b) the direct sum decomposition (3.2) holds.\nProof. It suffices to construct a cofinal set of non-degenerate perturbations of K,\nsuch that the direct sum decomposition (3.2) holds for all of those Hamiltonians\nand is compatible with the monotone homotopy maps.\nConsider the perturbations that differ from K on V \\U only by a constant. These\nform a cofinal set, since for every perturbation H \u2265 K we can find a smaller one with\nthat additional property. We can choose these perturbations to be non-degenerate,\nas K does not have periodic orbits in V\u0304 \\ U and there are no restrictions on the\nperturbation outside V\u0304 \\ U . The connecting maps between the Floer homologies\nof the perturbations are monotone homotopy maps and respect the direct sum\ndecomposition. Thus we also have a direct sum in the limit.\n\u0003\n3.2. Energy estimates and the proof of Proposition 3.2. To prove the proposition, we need to find a lower bound for the energy of Floer trajectories crossing\nthe shell V \\ \u016a . The first lemma can be used to bound the time-integral in the\nexpression for the energy away from zero for the part of a Floer trajectory in a\ncompact set not containing one-periodic orbits.\nLemma 3.5. Let W be a bounded open set with smooth boundary and at least two\nboundary components and let K be an autonomous Hamiltonian on W\u0304 . Assume\nthat K is constant on each boundary component and does not have one-periodic\norbits in W\u0304 . Then there exists a constant C1 > 0, depending only on the almost\ncomplex structure J, the open set W and K such that:\n(i) For T \u2264 1, any path \u03b3 : [0, T ] \u2192 W\u0304 , which connects two distinct boundary\ncomponents of W , satisfies\nZ T\n2\nk\u03b3\u0307(t) \u2212 XK (\u03b3(t))k dt > C1 .\n0\n\n\f10\n\nDORIS HEIN\n\n(ii) Any loop \u03b3 : S 1 \u2192 W\u0304 satisfies\nZ\n2\nk\u03b3\u0307(t) \u2212 XK (\u03b3(t))k dt > C1 .\nS1\n\nThis lemma is a generalization of lemmas in [Us], but the existence of similar\nlower bounds goes back to [Sa]. The proof given in Section 3.3, however, differs\nfrom the proofs in [Sa, Us]. With W = V \\ \u016a , this lemma implies the proposition\nif the area of u\u22121 (W ) is small. If this area is not small, we need the following\nlemma to relate the area of the domain and the energy for certain parts of a Floer\ntrajectory.\nLemma 3.6 (Usher's lemma). Let W be a bounded open set with smooth boundary\nand at least two boundary components and let K be an autonomous Hamiltonian\non W\u0304 . Let S be a connected subset of the cylinder S 1 \u00d7 R and let u : S \u2192 W\u0304 satisfy\nthe Floer equation (2.1) with Hamiltonian K. Assume that u(\u2202S) \u2286 \u2202W . If u(S)\nintersects two distinct boundary components of W , then there exists a constant C2 ,\ndepending only on the domain W , the Hamiltonian K and the complex structure J\non W , such that\nArea(S) + E(u) \u2265 C2 .\nThis lemma is a generalization of Lemma 2.3 in [Us]. We prove this lemma in\nSection 3.4 and continue here with the proof of Proposition 3.2. Similarly to the\nspecial case in [Us], both lemmas are used with W being the shell between two\nopen sets to bound the energy of certain Floer trajectories away from zero.\nPick two open sets U 0 and V 0 bounded by level sets of K such that\nU \u2282 U 0 \u2282 V 0 \u2282 V.\nDenote the loop t 7\u2192 u(t, s) for fixed s by \u03b3s (t) and consider the set\nZ = {s \u2208 R | \u03b3s intersects V 0 \\ U 0 } .\nThen for every s \u2208 Z, we either have \u03b3s \u2286 V \\ U or \u03b3s intersects one of the\nboundary components of V \\ U . In the first case we can apply Lemma 3.5 (ii) to\nthe Hamiltonian K and W = V \\ \u016a .\nIn the second case, the path \u03b3s also intersects one of the boundary components\nof V 0 \\ U 0 and we can apply Lemma 3.5 (i) with W taken to be one of the shells\nV \\ V 0 or U 0 \\ U . Denote by C the minimum of the constants C1 from Lemma 3.5\nfor the shells V \\ U , V \\ V 0 and U 0 \\ U .\nThen we have the following estimate for the energy of u:\nZ Z\n2\nE(u) =\nk\u2202s uk dt ds\nR S1\nZ Z\n2\n\u2265\nk\u2202t u(s, t) \u2212 XK (u(s, t))k dt ds\n1\nZZ S\n\u2265\nC ds = C mLeb (Z).\nZ\n\nIf mLeb (Z) \u2265 C2 /2, where C2 is the constant from Lemma 3.6 for the shell\nW = V 0 \\ U 0 , we have a lower bound CC2 /2 for the energy of u.\nIf mLeb (Z) < C2 /2, we choose S as one connected component of u\u22121 (V 0 \\ U 0 ),\nsuch that u(S) intersects both boundary components. Since u intersects \u2202U and\n\u2202V , such a set S exists and S \u2286 Z \u00d7 S 1 . Then we have Area(S) \u2264 mLeb (Z) \u2264 C2 /2\n\n\fCONLEY CONJECTURE FOR IRRATIONAL SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS\n\n11\n\nand u(\u2202S) \u2286 \u2202(V 0 \\ U 0 ). Now Lemma 3.6 applies with W = V 0 \\ \u016a 0 and we find\nthat\nE(u) \u2265 E(u|S ) \u2265 C2 \u2212 Area(S) \u2265 C2 /2.\nThus with \u000f = min{CC2 /2, C2 /2} we have found a lower bound for the energy in\neither case.\n3.3. Proof of Lemma 3.5. By the Schwarz inequality, we have\n!2\nZ T\nZ T\n2\nk\u03b3\u0307(t) \u2212 XK (\u03b3(t))k dt\nk\u03b3\u0307(t) \u2212 XK (\u03b3(t))k dt \u2265\n0\n\n0\n\nfor T \u2264 1 and it suffices to find a lower bound for the L1 -norm.\nTo that end, for a path \u03b3(t) in W\u0304 , we define the path \u03b7(t) = \u03c6\u2212t\nK (\u03b3(t)). By the\nchain rule we have\nd t \u0001\n\u03c6 (\u03b7(t))\n\u03b3\u0307(t) = d\u03c6tK (\u03b7(t))\u03b7\u0307(t) +\ndt K\nt\n= d\u03c6K (\u03b7(t))\u03b7\u0307(t) + XK (\u03b3(t)).\nRecall for part (i) that we assume K to be autonomous and constant on the\nboundary components of W . The two boundary components of W are preserved\nunder the flow. Since \u03b3 connects two distinct boundary components of W , the same\nis true for \u03b7. Denote the distance of these boundary components by \u03b4. Then we\nfind the lower bound by the following calculation:\nZ T\nZ T\nk\u03b3\u0307(t) \u2212 XK (\u03b3(t))k dt =\nkd\u03c6tK (\u03b7(t))\u03b7\u0307(t)k dt\n0\n\n0\n\nZ\n>\n\nc*\n\nT\n\nk\u03b7\u0307(t)k dt\n0\n\n\u2265 c * d(\u03b7(0), \u03b7(T ))\n\u2265 c * \u03b4.\nThe constant c is positive since K is smooth and both t and \u03b7(t) are varying in\ncompact sets and K has no critical points in W\u0304 .\nSimilarly, we find for part (ii)\nZ\nZ 1\nk\u03b3\u0307(t) \u2212 XK (\u03b3(t))k dt =\nkd\u03c6tK (\u03b7(t))\u03b7\u0307(t)k dt\nS1\n\n0\n\n\u2265\n\nc * d(\u03b7(0), \u03b7(1))\n\n=\n\n\u0001\nc * d \u03b3(0), \u03c6\u22121\nK (\u03b3(0)) .\n\nAs W\u0304 is compact and \u03c6K is continuous with no one-periodic orbits in W\u0304 , this\ndistance is bounded away from zero.\nThus in both parts we have found a lower bound and we set C1 to be the\nminimum of those bounds.\n3.4. Proof of Usher's lemma. For simplicity of notation, we assume that W has\nexactly two boundary components. Recall that we want to prove the existence of\na lower bound for Area(S) + E(u) which is independent of u. Since u is a solution\n \u0303\nof the Floer equation, the graph \u0169 : S \u2192 S 1 \u00d7 R \u00d7 W\u0304 is a J-holomorphic\ncurve for\n \u0303\na certain almost complex structure J which is tamed by \u03c9\u0303 = ds \u2227 dt \u2212 dt \u2227 dK + \u03c9.\n \u0303 see the proof of Lemma 2.3 in [Us]). This almost\n(For the precise definition of J,\n\n\f12\n\nDORIS HEIN\n\ncomplex structure J \u0303 depends only on the almost complex structure J on W\u0304 and on\nthe Hamiltonian K on W\u0304 .\nFor any subset S 0 \u2286 S, this definition of \u03c9\u0303 gives\nZ\nZ\nZ\n2\n\u2202u\nds dt = Area(S 0 ) + E(u|S 0 ).\n\u0169\u2217 \u03c9\u0303 =\nds \u2227 dt +\nS0\nS0\nS 0 \u2202s Jt\nLet \u03a3 be a closed hypersurface in W which separates the two boundary components of W . By assumption, u intersects both boundary components. Thus there\nexists a z0 \u2208 S such that u0 = u(z0 ) \u2208 \u03a3. We now choose a ball B \u2286 W centered\nat u0 and a disk D \u2286 S 1 \u00d7 R with fixed radius centered at z0 .\nNow we consider a ball B\u0303 centered at (z0 , u0 ) and contained in D \u00d7 B. Since the\nradius of D is fixed, the radius of this ball B\u0303 depends only on the radius of B and\nthus only on the open set W . Then we define\nS\u0303 = {z \u2208 S | \u0169(z) \u2208 B\u0303}.\nBy definition, the boundary of S\u0303 is mapped to the boundary of B\u0303. Indeed, \u0169(\u2202S)\nis contained in (\u2202S) \u00d7 (\u2202W ) and therefore not in B\u0303 \u2286 D \u00d7 B.\nLet us now view the graph of u as a map \u0169 : S\u0303 \u2192 B\u0303. As B is contained in W ,\nwhere K is fixed, the complex structure J \u0303 on D \u00d7 B depends only on the ball B,\nthe Hamiltonian K|W and the complex structure J on W .\nBy definition of S\u0303, the center (z0 , u0 ) = \u0169(z0 ) of B\u0303 is contained in the image of\n \u0303\n\u0169. Now \u0169 is considered to be a J-holomorphic\ncurve in B\u0303, which is passing through\nthe center and has no boundary in the interior of B\u0303. For this \u0169, Proposition 4.3.1(ii)\nin [Si] applies and we have Area(S\u0303) + E(u|S\u0303 ) \u2265 C2 (u0 ).\nThis constant C2 (u0 ) still depends on u, since the choice of the center u0 of the\nball B depends on u. To obtain a constant that is independent of u, we take the\ninfimum over all possible u0 and define\nC2 = inf{C2 (u0 ) | u0 \u2208 \u03a3}.\nSince the hypersurface \u03a3 is compact, this constant C2 is positive and independent\nof u with Area(S) + E(u) \u2265 Area(S\u0303) + E(u|S\u0303 ) \u2265 C2 > 0.\n4. Proof of Theorem 1.5\n4.1. Outline of the proof. The key to proving Theorem 1.5 is a geometrical\ndescription of symplectically degenerate maxima given in Proposition 4.2. In particular, we can assume that the symplectically degenerate maximum is a constant\norbit p with trivial capping. Furthermore, we can assume that p is a strict local\nmaximum of H and that H has arbitrarily small Hessian at p.\nThen we use the squeezing method from [BPS, Gi, GG1] and construct Hamiltonians H+ and H\u2212 such that H\u2212 < H < H+ . It suffices to show that a linear\nhomotopy from H+ to H\u2212 induces a non-zero map between the filtered Floer homology groups of H\u00b1 for the action interval in question, since this map factors\nthrough the filtered Floer homology of H. Then the Floer homology group of H\ncannot be trivial.\nAs functions of the distance from p, the functions H+ and H\u2212 are constructed\nsimilarly to the ones used in [Gi, GG2]; see Section 4.3 for details.\nFor the Hamiltonians H\u00b1 we use the direct sum decomposition from Proposition 3.1. By construction of H\u00b1 and Remark 3.3, this will be compatible with the\n\n\fCONLEY CONJECTURE FOR IRRATIONAL SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS\n\n13\n\nlimit construction of filtered Floer homology and the monotone homotopy map for a\nhomotopy from H+ to H\u2212 . To prove that the monotone homotopy map is non-zero,\nit suffices to show that the restriction to one of the summands is an isomorphism.\nWe will consider the summand HF\u2217 (H\u00b1 , U ) for a neighborhood U of the symplectically degenerate maximum p, as this depends only on the functions restricted\nto U and the symplectic structure in U and is independent of the ambient manifold.\nThus we can view U as an open set in any symplectic manifold and the theorem\nfollows as in the symplectically asherical case in [Gi].\nRemark 4.1. This process of localizing the problem is fundamentally different from\nthe localization in the definition of local Floer homology. Here we only fix the\nHamiltonian on a shell V \\ U between two bounded open sets U and V . Then we\nuse the small action interval, and thus small energy of Floer trajectories, to ensure\nthat the trajectories do not leave V using the energy bounds from Section 3.2.\nFor local Floer homology we do not directly restrict the action interval but fix\nthe Hamiltonian outside an open set U that only contains one isolated one-periodic\norbit x\u0304. Then we take a small non-degenerate perturbation of the Hamiltonian to\nsplit this one-periodic orbit up into non-degenerate periodic orbits. The actions\nof those are close to the action of x\u0304 and thus the energy of Floer trajectories\nconnecting them is small. As the Hamiltonian is fixed outside U , this ensures that\nFloer trajectories between orbits in U stay in U . Then the local Floer homology is\ndefined by restricting the definition of Floer homology to U .\n4.2. Geometric characterization of symplectically degenerate maxima. In\nthis section we state some geometric properties of symplectically degenerate maxima. The existence of a symplectically degenerate maximum enters the proof of\nTheorem 1.5 only via those properties.\nFor the formulation of the geometric characterization of a symplectically degenerate maximum we first need to recall the definition of the norm of a tensor with\nrespect to a coordinate system. By definition, on a finite-dimensional vector space\nthe norm kvk\u039e of a tensor v with respect to a coordinate system \u039e is the norm\nof v with respect to the inner product for which \u039e is an orthonormal basis. For a\ncoordinate system \u03be on a manifold M near a point p, the natural coordinate basis\nin Tp M is denoted by \u03bep .\nProposition 4.2 ([GG2, GG3]). Let x\u0304 be a symplectically degenerate maximum of\na Hamiltonian H and let p = x(0) \u2208 M . Then there exists a sequence of contractible\nloops \u03b7i of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms such that x(t) = \u03b7it (p), i.e each loop \u03b7i\nsends p to x. Furthermore, the Hamiltonians K i given by \u03c6tH = \u03b7it \u25e6 \u03c6tK i and the\nloops \u03b7i satisfy the following conditions:\n(K1) The point p is a strict local maximum of Kti for t \u2208 S 1 .\n(K2) There exist symplectic bases \u039ei of Tp M such that\nd2 (Kti )p\n\n\u039ei\n\n\u2192 0 uniformly in t \u2208 S 1 .\n\n(K3) The loop \u03b7i\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b7j has identity\u0001 linearization at p for all i and j (i.e. for all\nt \u2208 S 1 we have d (\u03b7it )\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b7jt p = I), and is contractible to id in the class\nof such loops.\nA proof of this proposition and also of the fact that this description is equivalent\nto the definition of symplectically degenerate maxima can be found in [GG2, GG3].\n\n\f14\n\nDORIS HEIN\n\nH+\n\nH\nU\n\nF\n\nV\n\nFigure 1. The functions H+ and F as functions of the distance\nfrom p\nIt is also shown there that the conditions (K1) and (K2) already imply (K3) as a\nformal consequence.\nWhen the concept of symplectically degenerate maxima was introduced in [Hi]\nby Hingston and in the first formal definition given in [Gi], this characterization\nwas used as a definition of symplectically degenerate maxima.\nRemark 4.3. The loops \u03b7i\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b7j are loops of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms fixing p.\nThe construction in [Gi] shows that the loops \u03b7i can be chosen such that \u03b7i\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b7j\nare supported in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of p.\n4.3. The functions H+ and H\u2212 . By Proposition 4.2 above it suffices to prove\nthe theorem for the function K 1 and the constant orbit p with trivial capping\nas symplectically degenerate maximum. We keep the notation H for K 1 . Fix a\nDarboux chart in a neighborhood W of p such that p is a strict global maximum of\nH on W . We also fix now an almost complex structure J on M that is compatible\nwith \u03c9.\nLet U and V be balls centered at p and contained in W . We then construct the\nfunction H+ and an auxiliary function F to be of the form shown in Figure 1.\nMore concretely, we fix balls\nBr\u2212 \u2282 Br+ \u2282 Br \u2282 U \u2282 V \u2282 BR \u2282 BR\u2212 \u2282 BR+ b W.\nThen the function H+ is defined to be radially symmetric around p with the\nfollowing properties:\n\u2022 H+ \u2265 H and H+ \u2261 c = H(p) on Br\u2212 .\n\u2022 On Br+ \\ Br\u2212 the function H+ is monotone decreasing.\n\u2022 On Br \\ Br+ the function is constant.\n\u2022 In the shell BR \\Br the function is monotone increasing, linear as a function\nof the square of the distance from p with small slope \u03b1 on V \\ U such that\nthere are no one-periodic orbits in V \\ Br .\n\u2022 The function H+ is again constant on BR\u2212 \\ BR with a value less than c.\n\u2022 It is monotone increasing on BR+ \\ BR\u2212\n\u2022 Outside BR+ the function H+ is constant and equal to its maximum.\nInside Br and outside BR the construction of H+ is exactly as in [Gi]. The linear\npart in V \\ U ensures that Proposition 3.1 applies.\nMore concretely, we first choose some small constant \u03b10 > 0 such that \u03b10 /\u03c0 is\nirrational. Then we fix the Hamiltonian H+ on Br and pick \u000f > 0 smaller than the\n\n\fCONLEY CONJECTURE FOR IRRATIONAL SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS\n\n15\n\nenergy bound from Proposition 3.1 for a Hamiltonian linear with slope \u03b10 on V \\ U .\nUsing these choices we take a sufficiently large order of iteration k as in [Gi, GG2].\nFurthermore, we now fix H+ outside Br with slope \u03b1 = \u03b10 /k on V \\ U . We thus\nhave the direct sum decomposition of filtered Floer homology by Proposition 3.1 for\n(k)\nH+ . At this point we choose some \u03b4k \u2208 (0, \u000f/2), depending on k, to ensure that\nthe action intervals intervals (kc + \u03b4k , kc + \u000f) and (kc \u2212 \u03b4k , kc + \u03b4k ) are sufficiently\nsmall for the direct sum decomposition.\nLet us now turn to the construction of H\u2212 using the existence of a symplectically degenerate maximum. The geometrical characterization of symplectically\ndegenerate maxima in Proposition 4.2 and Remark 4.3 imply that we have\n\u2022 a loop \u03b7 t of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms fixing p, which is supported in U ,\n\u2022 and a system of coordinates \u03be on a neighborhood W of p\nsuch that the Hamiltonian K generating the flow \u03b7 \u2212t \u25e6 \u03c6tH has a strict local maximum at p and maxt d2 (Kt )p \u03bep is sufficiently small. The loop \u03b7 is contractible\nin the class of loops having identity linearization at p. Let Gts be a Hamiltonian\ngenerating such a homotopy \u03b7st , normalized by Gts (p) \u2261 0. We then normalize K\nby the additional requirement that Kt (p) \u2261 c (or equivalently that H = G#K).\nThen there exists a function F , depending on the coordinate system \u03be, such that\n\u2022 d2 Fp \u03bep is sufficiently small,\n\u2022 F \u2264 K and F (p) = c = H(p) is the global maximum of F .\nTo be more precise, in Br the function F is a bump function centered at p, constant\noutside BR and differs from H+ only by a constant on V \\ U . The last condition\nis necessary to have the direct sum decompositions of the filtered Floer homology\ngroups of H+ and F be compatible with the monotone homotopy map for a linear\nhomotopy from H+ to F .\nThen F s = Gs #F \u2264 H+ is an isospectral homotopy with F 1 = F , i.e., a\nhomotopy such that the action spectrum S(F s ) is independent of s. We define the\nfunction H\u2212 by\nH\u2212 := G0 #F \u2264 G0 #K = H.\nSince \u03b7 is supported in U , the function G0 is constant outside U . Then H\u2212 differs\nfrom F and H+ only by the constant value of G on V\u0304 \\ U . Therefore we also have\nthe direct sum decomposition from Proposition 3.1 for H\u2212 . It is compatible with\nthe homomorphism induced by the homotopy F s and the monotone homotopy map\nfor a homotopy from H+ to H\u2212 .\n4.4. The Floer homology of H\u00b1 and the monotone homotopy map. In the\nsymplectically aspherical case, the filtered Floer homology groups for F and H+ in\nthe action intervals in question have been calculated in [Gi, GG1]. Using this, we\nobtain an isomorphism\n(kc+\u03b4\nZ2 \u223c\n= HFn+1\n\nk , kc+\u000f)\n\n(k)\n\n(kc+\u03b4k , kc+\u000f)\n\n(H+ , U ) \u2192 HFn+1\n\n(F (k) , U ) \u223c\n= Z2\n\nby the same argument as in [Gi], since this summand behaves exactly like the\nfiltered Floer homology in the symplectically aspherical case. Then we have the\n\n\f16\n\nDORIS HEIN\n\ncommutative diagram\n(kc+\u000f, kc+\u03b4k )\n\n(k)\n\nn+1\n\n\u2212\n\nHFn+1\n\n(H+ , U )\nUUUU\nUUUU\u223c\n=\nUUUU\n\u03a8\nUUUU\n\u000f\n*\n\u223c\n=\n(kc+\u000f, kc+\u03b4k )\n(k)\n/ HF(kc+\u000f, kc+\u03b4k ) (F (k) , U )\nHF\n(H , U )\nn+1\n\nwhere the horizontal map is induced by the isopsectral homotopy F s and the other\nmaps are monotone homotopy maps. As in the symplectically aspherical case, the\nisospectral homotopy induces an isomorphism in this summand of the filtered Floer\nhomology. The commutativity is established the same way as in the symplectically\naspherical case. (Observe that it is essential to use the \"localized\" Floer homology\nfor all Hamiltonians in the diagram. For the full filtered Floer homology groups,\nthe standard argument for the commutativity of the analogous diagram does not\napply in the case of a symplectically irrational manifold.) The diagonal map is\nan isomorphism by the same argument as in [Gi] using the long exact sequence\nof filtered Floer homology to go over to the action interval (kc \u2212 \u03b4k , kc + \u03b4k ). By\nthe commutativity of this diagram, the map \u03a8 is also an isomorphism. Thus the\nmonotone homotopy map\n(kc+\u03b4k , kc+\u000f)\n\nHFn+1\n\n(k)\n\n(kc+\u03b4k , kc+\u000f)\n\n(H+ ) \u2192 HFn+1\n\n(k)\n\n(H\u2212 )\n\nis non-zero and this map factors through the Floer homology group of H, which we\nwant to show to be non-trivial. This proves Theorem 1.5.\nReferences\n[BPS]\n[Co]\n[CZ]\n[FH]\n[Gi]\n[GG1]\n[GG2]\n[GG3]\n[Hi]\n[Sa]\n[SZ]\n[Si]\n\n[Us]\n\nP. Biran, L. Polterovich, D.
