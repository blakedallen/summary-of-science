In the same period a radio-to-optical monitoring of the source was provided by the GASP\u2013WEBT and REM facilities. In the radio band we\nmade use also of multi-epoch 15-GHz Very Long Baseline Array data from the MOJAVE Program to get information on the parsec-scale structure.\nMoreover, several Swift target of opportunity observations were triggered, adding important information on the source behaviour from optical/UV\nto hard X-rays. We paid particular attention to the calibration of the Swift/UVOT data to make it suitable to the blazars spectra. Simultaneous\nobservations from radio to \u03b3-rays allowed us to study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at different frequencies and to\ninvestigate the mechanisms at work during this high activity state of the source.\nIn the period 9\u201330 March 2009, AGILE detected \u03b3-ray emission from PKS 1510\u2212089 at a significance level of 21.5-\u03c3 with an average flux over\nthe entire period of (311 \u00b1 21) \u00d7 10\u22128 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 for photon energies above 100 MeV, and a peak level of (702 \u00b1 131) \u00d7 10\u22128 photons cm\u22122\ns\u22121 on daily integration. The activity detected in \u03b3-rays occurred during a period of increasing activity from near-infrared to UV, as monitored\nby GASP\u2013WEBT, REM and Swift/UVOT. A flaring episode on 26-27 March 2009 was detected from near-IR to UV, suggesting that a single\nmechanism is responsible for the flux enhancement observed at the end of March. By contrast, Swift/XRT observations seem to show no clear\ncorrelation of the X-ray fluxes with the optical and \u03b3-ray ones. However, the X-ray observations show a harder photon index (\u0393x \u2243 1.3\u20131.6) with\nrespect to most FSRQs and a hint of harder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a second emission component at soft\nX-ray energies. Moreover, the broad band spectrum from radio-to-UV confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/UV spectrum of\nPKS 1510\u2212089 also during high \u03b3-ray state. On the other hand, during 25-26 March 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/UV energy band was\nobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission in this part of the spectrum during the brightest \u03b3-ray flare, therefore\na significant shift of the synchrotron peak.\nKey words. gamma-rays: observations \u2013 mechanism: non-thermal \u2013 quasars: individual (PKS 1510\u2212089)\n\n1.

D'Ammando et al.: AGILE detection of extreme \u03b3-ray activity from the blazar PKS 1510\u2212089 during March 2009\n\nangles with respect to our line of sight, which causes relativistic\naberration and emission amplification (Blandford & Rees 1978).\nBlazars are the most enigmatic subclass of AGNs, characterized by the emission of strong non-thermal radiation across\nthe entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to very high \u03b3ray energies. Because of their peculiar properties and amplified\nemission, blazars offer the unique possibility to probe the central region of AGNs, and shed light on the mechanism responsible for the extraction of energy from the central black hole\nand for the acceleration and collimation of relativistic electrons\ninto jets. With the detection of several blazars in the \u03b3-rays by\nEGRET (Hartman et al. 1999) the study of this class of objects\nhas made significant progress but, despite the big efforts devoted\nto the investigation of the mechanisms responsible for the emission in blazars, the definitive answer is still missing. The new\ngeneration of high-energy space missions, the Astrorivelatore\nGamma a Immagini LEggero (AGILE) and Fermi Gamma-ray\nSpace Telescope (GST) satellites, have to address some of the\nfundamental issues that were left unresolved by EGRET.\nPKS 1510\u2212089 is a nearby (z=0.361) blazar belonging to the\nclass of the flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) with radiative\noutput dominated by the \u03b3-ray emission, while the synchrotron\nemission peaks around IR frequencies, below a pronunced UV\nbump, likely due to the thermal emission from the accretion disk\n(Malkan & Moore 1986; Pian & Treves 1993; D'Ammando et\nal. 2009a).\nIts radio emission exhibits very rapid, large amplitude variations in both total and polarized flux (Aller, Aller, & Hughes\n1996). Moreover, the radio jet shows superluminal motion with\nan apparent velocity higher than 20c, among the fastest of all\nblazars observed thus far (Jorstad et al. 2005), with the parsec\nand kiloparsec scale jets apparently misaligned by \u223c180 degrees\n(Homan et al. 2002, Wardle et al. 2005).\nPKS 1510\u2212089 has been extensively observed in the Xrays during the last three decades, since the observations by the\nEinstein satellite in 1980s (Canizares & White 1989). The X-ray\nspectrum as observed by ASCA in the 2\u201310 keV band was very\nhard with photon index of \u0393 \u2243 1.3 (Singh, Shrader & George\n1997), but steepened (\u0393 \u2243 1.9) in the ROSAT bandpass (0.1\u2013\n2.4 keV), suggesting the presence of a spectral break around 1\u20132\nkeV, associated with the existence of a soft X-ray excess (Siebert\net al. 1998). Subsequent observations by BeppoSAX (Tavecchio\net al. 2000) and Chandra (Gambill et al. 2003) confirmed the\npresence of a soft X-ray excess below 1 keV. Evidence of a similar soft X-ray excess has been detected in other blazars such as\n3C 273, 3C 279, AO 0235+164, and 3C 454.3. The origin of this\nexcess is still an open issue, not only for blazars but for all AGNs\n(see e.g. D'Ammando et al. 2008, and the references therein).\nThe interest in the peculiar X-ray spectrum of the source\nled up to a monitoring campaign organized during August 2006\nby Suzaku and Swift. The Suzaku observations confirmed the\npresence of a soft X-ray excess, suggesting that it could be\na feature of the bulk Comptonization, whereas the Swift/XRT\nobservations revealed significant spectral evolution of the Xray emission on timescales of a week: the X-ray spectrum becomes harder as the source gets brighter (Kataoka et al. 2008).\nUnfortunately no \u03b3-ray satellites were operating at that time,\ntherefore it was not possible to investigate the correlation between X-ray and \u03b3-ray behaviour. However, \u03b3-ray emission from\nPKS 1510\u2212089 had already been detected in the past by EGRET\nduring low/intermediate states and was found to be only slightly\nvariable, with an integrated flux above 100 MeV varying between (13 \u00b1 5) and (49 \u00b1 18) \u00d7 10\u22128 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Hartman\net al. 1999).\n2\n\nInstead, in the last three years PKS 1510\u2212089 showed extreme variability over the whole electromagnetic spectrum and\nin particular very intense \u03b3-ray activity was detected, intermittently, by the AGILE and Fermi satellites. The monitoring\nof the source between September 2008 and June 2009 with\nthe Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard Fermi is summarized in Abdo et al. (2010a). The Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector\n(GRID) onboard AGILE detected flaring episodes in August\n2007 (Pucella et al. 2008) and March 2008 (D'Ammando et\nal. 2009a). Subsequently, an extraordinary \u03b3-ray activity was\ndetected in March 2009, with several flaring episodes and a\nflux that reached \u223c 700 \u00d7 10\u22128 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 . Preliminary\nresults were presented in D'Ammando et al. (2009b), Pucella\net al. (2009), Vercellone et al. (2009). Recently, Marscher et\nal. (2010) studying the flux behaviour at different frequencies,\nlinear optical polarization, and parsec-scale structure of PKS\n1510\u2212089 found a correspondence between the rotation of the\noptical polarization angle and the \u03b3-ray activity during the first\nsix months of 2009.\nIn this paper we discuss the results of the analysis of the multiwavelength data of PKS 1510\u2212089 collected by GLAST-AGILE\nSupport Program (GASP) of the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope\n(WEBT), Rapid Eye Mount (REM), Swift and AGILE during\nMarch 2009 and their implications for the emission mechanisms at work in this source. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly introduces the multiwavelength coverage on PKS 1510\u2212089. In Sections 3 through 7 we present the\nanalysis and results of AGILE, Swift, GASP-WEBT, REM, and\nVery Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data, respectively. In Section\n8 we discuss the contribution of the thermal emission in the\nlow-energy part of the spectrum and the correlation between the\nemission at different energy bands. Finally, in Section 9 we draw\nour conclusions.\nThroughout this paper the quoted uncertainties are given at\n1-\u03c3 level, unless otherwise stated, and the photon indices are\nparameterized as N(E) \u221d E \u2212\u0393 (ph cm\u22122 s\u22121 keV\u22121 or MeV\u22121 )\nwith \u0393 = \u03b1 + 1 (\u03b1 being the spectral index).\n\n2. The multiwavelength coverage\nThe high \u03b3-ray activity observed by AGILE during March 2009\ntriggered 15 Swift ToO observations, starting from 11 March\n2009, for a total of 46 ks. Moreover, the monitoring by GASP\u2013\nWEBT in February\u2013March 2009 provided important information from radio-to-optical band and, together with the data collected in near-IR and optical bands by REM during March 2009,\nallowed us to also obtain an excellent coverage in the low-energy\npart of the broad band spectrum of the source. Finally, high resolution radio VLBI data at 15 GHz were obtained by monitoring\nthe source within the Monitoring of Jets in Active galactic nuclei\nwith VLBA Experiment (MOJAVE) project.\nA summary of the complete multiwavelength data set on\nPKS 1510\u2212089 presented in this paper can be found in Table\n1.\n\n3. AGILE observations: data analysis and results\nThe AGILE scientific instrument (Tavani et al. 2009) is very\ncompact and combines four detectors that provide broad band\ncoverage from hard X-rays to \u03b3-rays: a Silicon Tracker (ST) optimized for \u03b3-ray imaging in the 30 MeV \u2013 30 GeV energy range\n(Prest et al. 2003; Barbiellini et al. 2001); a co-aligned codedmask X-ray imager sensitive in the 18\u201360 keV energy range\n\n\fF.

The combination of ST, MCAL and\nACS forms the GRID that assures the \u03b3-ray detection.\nThe AGILE satellite observed PKS 1510\u2212089 between 1\nMarch 2009 00:01 UT and 31 March 2009 11:41 UT (JD\n2454891.5-2454921.0), for a total of 325 hours of effective exposure time, during which the source moved from \u223c 25\u25e6 to \u223c 55\u25e6\noff the AGILE pointing direction.\nAGILE-GRID data were analyzed, starting from the Level\u2013\n1 data, using the AGILE Standard Analysis Pipeline and the\nAGILE Scientific Analysis Package. Counts, exposure, and\nGalactic background \u03b3-ray maps, the latter based on the diffuse emission model developed for AGILE (Giuliani et al. 2004),\nwere generated with a bin size of 0.25\u25e6 \u00d7 0.25\u25e6 for photons with\nenergies E > 100 MeV. We selected only the events flagged\nas confirmed \u03b3-ray events, and not collected during the South\nAtlantic Anomaly or whose reconstructed directions form angles with the satellite-Earth vector smaller than 80\u25e6 , in order to\nreduce the \u03b3-ray Earth albedo contamination.\nPKS 1510\u2212089 was detected over the period 1\u201330 March\n2009 at a significance level of 19.9-\u03c3, with an average \u03b3-ray flux\nof FE > 100 MeV = (162 \u00b1 12) \u00d7 10\u22128 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 . Figure 1\nshows the \u03b3-ray light curve of March 2009 with 1-day resolution for photons with energy higher than 100 MeV. The average\n\u03b3-ray flux as well as the daily values were derived by the maximum likelihood analysis, according to the procedure described\nin Mattox et al. (1993): first, the entire period was analyzed to\ndetermine the diffuse emission parameters, then the source flux\ndensity was estimated independently for each of the 1-day periods with the diffuse parameters fixed at the value obtained in the\nfirst step. At the beginning of the observation period the source\nwas not so active in \u03b3-rays as later. AGILE-GRID does not detect\nPKS 1510\u2212089 at a significance level higher than 3-\u03c3 between\n\n1 and 8 March 2009 and only upper limits at 95% confidence\nlevel are obtained1. Instead, in the period 9\u201330 March 2009 (JD\n2454899.5\u20132454921.5) different flaring episodes were detected\nand considering only this time interval the significance of detection slightly increases to 21.5-\u03c3, with an average flux of (311 \u00b1\n21) \u00d7 10\u22128 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 .\nIn the period 9\u201330 March 2009 the AGILE 95% maximum\nlikelihood contour level barycenter of the source is l = 351.278\u25e6\nb = 40.058\u25e6, with a distance between the \u03b3-ray position and the\nradio position (l = 351.289\u25e6, b = 40.139\u25e6) of 0.08\u25e6 and an overall\nAGILE error circle of radius r = 0.15\u25e6.\nThe \u03b3-ray light curve shows a complex structure with outbursts having a duration of 4\u20135 days and approximately symmetrical profile that could be an indication that the relevant timescale\nis the light crossing time of the emitting region. The peak level\nof activity with daily integration was FE > 100 MeV = (702 \u00b1 131)\n\u00d7 10\u22128 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 on 25 March 2009 (JD 2454916.0)2.\nThis is the highest \u03b3-ray flux observed from this source on daily\ntimescale and one of the highest fluxes detected from a blazar.\nWe note that the increasing of the error on the flux estimation\nthroughout the whole observation period is related to the fact\nthat with the increase of the off-axis angle between the center\nof the field of view of the GRID and the position of the source,\nthe possible background contamination and the GRID calibration uncertainties become slightly higher. Despite the different\nenergy range and T start of the daily light curves, the AGILE results are in agreement with the Fermi-LAT results presented in\nAbdo et al. (2010a).\nUnfortunately, the source was located substantially off-axis\nin the SuperAGILE field of view during the whole observation\nperiod, thus preventing us to extract a constraining upper limit\nin the 18\u201360 keV energy band with SuperAGILE.\nThe \u03b3-ray spectrum during the first period of high activity detected by AGILE (9\u201316 March 2009; JD 2454899.5\u2013\n2454907.5) can be fitted with a power law of photon index \u0393\n= 1.95 \u00b1 0.15. The photon index is calculated with the weighted\nleast squares method by considering four energy bins: 100\u2013200\nMeV, 200\u2013400 MeV, 400 MeV\u20131 GeV, and 1\u20133 GeV. A similar value of the photon index (\u0393 = 1.96 \u00b1 0.24) is estimated\nalso in the period of the highest activity (23\u201327 March 2009;\nJD 2454913.5\u20132454918.5). Considering that during this second\nperiod the source was far off-axis with respect to the center of\nthe GRID field of view, the energy bin 1\u20133 GeV is not considered in order to reduce the possible background contamination\nfor high off-axis angles at these energies. Comparing with the\naverage photon index measured by EGRET (\u0393 = 2.47 \u00b1 0.21,\nHartman et al. 1999) and that measured by Fermi-LAT over the\nfirst eleven months of observations (\u0393 = 2.41 \u00b1 0.01; Abdo et\nal. 2010b), the values observed by AGILE confirm a hardening\nof the \u03b3-ray spectrum during the very high activity detected in\nMarch 2009. A similar hard \u03b3-ray spectrum of PKS 1510\u2212089\nwas observed by AGILE during the flaring episode of March\n2008 (D'Ammando et al. 2009a).\nThe correlation between the flux level and the spectral slope\nin the \u03b3-ray energy band was extensively studied by means of the\nanalysis of all the EGRET data, but a firm result for the blazars\nis not found (Nandikotkur et al. 2007). A 'harder-when-brighter'\nbehaviour in \u03b3 rays of PKS 1510\u2212089 was detected by FermiLAT over a long timescale (August 2008\u2013June 2009) consid1\nWhen the significance level of the detection obtained by the maximum likelihood analysis is < 3-\u03c3 an upper limit at 95% confidence\nlevel is calculated (see Mattox et al. 1996).\n2\nIntegrating between 0:00 UT and 23:59 UT for each day.\n\n3\n\n\fF.

A similar trend was observed\nin the EGRET era only for 3C 279 (Hartman et al. 2001) and\nmarginally for PKS 0528+134 (Mukherjee et al. 1996), but this\ncould be due to the fact that these were the only objects for which\na long-term monitoring in \u03b3-rays was performed by EGRET. At\npresent, with AGILE and Fermi we are able to follow a large\nnumber of blazars on very long timescales and investigate this\nbehaviour on a larger sample of objects. In this context, considering the long period of high activity recently observed in \u03b3-rays,\nPKS 1510\u2212089 is one of the best test cases, together with 3C\n454.3 (see e.g. Vercellone et al. 2010).\n\n4. Swift observations: data analysis and results\nThe Swift satellite (Gehrels et al. 2004) performed 15 ToOs\non PKS 1510\u2212089 between 11 and 30 March 2009, triggered\nby the high \u03b3-ray activity of the source. The observations\nwere performed with all the three onboard instruments: the Xray Telescope (XRT; Burrows et al. 2005, 0.2\u201310.0 keV), the\nUltraViolet Optical Telescope (UVOT; Roming et al. 2005, 170600 nm), and the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT; Barthelmy et\nal. 2005, 15\u2013150 keV).\n4.1. Swift/BAT data\n\nAs part of its normal operations, BAT collects data over a wide\narea of the sky in its survey mode. The survey data in the 15\u201350\nkeV band is used to produce sky images in which hard X-ray\nsources can be detected using the standard Swift analysis software, following the procedures described in Krimm et al. (2008,\nand the reference therein; see also3 .).\nDuring March 2009, we detected two short flaring episodes\nfrom PKS 1510\u2212089. The first covered approximately 2 days beginning on 8 March 2009 (JD 2454899.0), with an average count\nrate of (0.006 \u00b1 0.002) counts s\u22121 cm\u22122 (15\u201350 keV), which corresponds to 28 mCrab and peaking on 9 March 2009 at 40 mCrab\n(Krimm et al. 2009). A second weaker episode occurred on 29\nMarch 2009 (JD 2454920.0), where the average count rate was\n(0.003 \u00b1 0.001) counts s\u22121 cm\u22122 , corresponding to 15 mCrab.\nAs a comparison we report that during the period before\nthe March 2008 \u03b3-ray flare detected by AGILE (D'Ammando\n3\n\n4\n\nhttp://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/results/transients\n\net al. 2009a), Swift/BAT recorded flaring episodes from PKS\n1510\u2212089 on 16 February 2008 (JD 2454513.0), 21 February\n2008 (JD 2454518.0) and 24 February 2008 (JD 2454521.0),\nwith count rates of approximately (0.005 \u00b1 0.002) counts s\u22121\ncm\u22122 on each of those observations.\n4.2. Swift/XRT data\n\nThe XRT data were processed with standard procedures\n(xrtpipeline v0.12.4), filtering, and screening criteria by using the Heasoft package (v.6.8). The source count rate was low\nduring the whole campaign (count rate < 0.5 counts s\u22121 ), so\nwe only considered photon counting (PC) data and further selected XRT event grades 0\u201312. Pile-up correction was not required. Source events were extracted from a circular region with\na radius between 15 and 20 pixels (1 pixel \u223c 2.36\u2032\u2032), depending on the source count rate, while background events were extracted from a circular region with radius 40 pixels away from\nbackground sources. Ancillary response files were generated\nwith xrtmkarf, and account for different extraction regions, vignetting and PSF corrections. We used the spectral redistribution matrices v011 in the Calibration Database maintained by\nHEASARC. Considering the very low number of photons collected on 26 and 27 March we summed the data of these two\nconsecutive days in order to have enough statistics to obtain a\ngood spectral fit.\nAll spectra were rebinned with a minimum of 20 counts per\nenergy bin to allow \u03c72 fitting within XSPEC (v12.5.1; Arnaud\n1996). We fit the individual spectra with a simple absorbed\npower law, with a neutral hydrogen column fixed to its Galactic\nvalue (6.89 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ; Kalberla et al. 2005). The fit results\nare reported in Table 2. The comparison between our results and\nthose presented by Abdo et al. (2010a) reveals some differences,\nwhich we ascribe to their using a lower number of counts per\nbin than generally adopted to allow \u03c72 fitting (\u2265 20 counts/bin).\nIndeed, these differences increase when the number of counts\ndecreases.\nDuring the 15 ToOs performed in March 2009, Swift/XRT\nobserved the source with a 0.3\u201310.0 keV flux in the range (0.8 \u2013\n1.1) \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , a somewhat fainter state with respect\nto the high flux level observed in August 2006 (Flux0.5\u221210 keV\n= (1.1 \u2013 1.8) \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ). Instead, a hint of spectral\ntrend seems to be present in the X-ray data. Figure 2 shows the\nXRT photon indexes as a function of the X-ray fluxes in the 0.3\u2013\n\n\fF.

A similar\nharder-when-brighter behaviour in X-rays was observed for PKS\n1510\u2212089 in August 2006 (Kataoka et al. 2008), March 2008\n(D'Ammando et al. 2009a), and over the period January\u2013June\n2009 (Abdo et al. 2010a).\n\n4.3. Swift/UVOT data\n\nUVOT observed PKS 1510\u2212089 in all its optical (v, b, and u)\nand UV (uvw1, uvm2, and uvw2) photometric bands. Data were\nreduced with the uvotmaghist task of the HEASOFT package.\nSource counts were extracted from a circular region of 5 arcsec\nradius, centred on the source, while the background was estimated from a surrounding annulus with 8 and 18 arcsec radii. In\nFig. 3 UVOT magnitudes are displayed with blue circles.\n\n1,0\n\n1,2\n\nPhoton index\n\nThe significant spectral evolution observed by XRT, with the\nphoton index changing from 1.3 to 1.6, is not usual for FSRQs,\nfor which only little X-ray variability is detected both on short\nand long timescales. Moreover, the average X-ray photon index\nobserved over March 2009 for this object (< \u0393 > = 1.48 \u00b1 0.03)\nis lower than that of the radio-loud quasars (< \u0393 > = 1.66 \u00b1\n0.07; Lawson et al. 1992, Cappi et al. 1997) and is more similar\nto that of the high-redshift (z > 2) quasars (e.g. Page et al. 2005).\nSince usually in FSRQs the X-ray energy range samples the lowenergy tail of the external Compton (EC) component, as already\ndiscussed in Kataoka et al.

GASP observations in radio, near-IR and optical\nbands: data analysis and results\nThe GLAST-AGILE Support Program (Villata et al. 2008,\n2009a) is a project born from the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope4\nin 2007. It is aimed at providing long-term monitoring in the optical (R-band), near-IR, and radio bands of 28 \u03b3-ray-loud blazars\nduring the lifetime of the two \u03b3-ray satellites.\nThe R-band GASP observations of PKS 1510\u2212089 in the\nperiod considered in this paper were performed by the following observatories: Abastumani, Calar Alto5 , Castelgrande,\nL'Ampolla, La Silla (MPG/ESO), Lulin (SLT), Roque de\nlos Muchachos (KVA and Liverpool), San Pedro Martir, St.\nPetersburg, and Valle d'Aosta. These data were calibrated with\nrespect to stars 2\u20136 by Raiteri et al. (1998). The GASP observation in R-band showed that after a low intensity period in\nFebruary 2009, with the source observed constantly at \u223c 16.5\n4\n\nhttp://www.oato.inaf.it/blazars/webt.\nCalar Alto data were acquired as part of the MAPCAT project\nhttp://www.iaa.es/\u223ciagudo/research/MAPCAT.\n5\n\n5\n\n\fF.

Near-IR data in J, H, and K bands are from Campo\nImperatore and Roque de los Muchachos (Liverpool), whereas\nWEBT data in B, V, and I bands were taken at Castelgrande,\nLa Silla and St. Petersburg. Data collected by GASP and WEBT\nobservatories during March 2009 are reported in Fig. 3 with red\ndiamonds and magenta triangles, respectively.\nRadio fluxes were measured at: Submillimeter Array6 (SMA,\n230 GHz), Medicina (22 and 5 GHz), Mets\u00e4hovi (37 GHz), Noto\n\n(43 GHz), and UMRAO (14.5 and 8.0 GHz). The radio data are\nshown in Fig. 4, together with the optical (R-band) and nearIR (H-band) light curve of PKS 1510\u2212089 in February\u2013March\n2009.\nWe point out that in those cases where different datasets were\npresent in the same band, we performed a careful data analysis\nto determine possible offsets and corrected for them to get homogeneous light curves, as usually done for GASP\u2013WEBT data\n(see e.g. Villata et al. 2002, Raiteri et al. 2005).\n\n6\nThese data were obtained as part of the normal monitoring program\ninitiated by the SMA (see Gurwell et al. 2007).\n\nDuring March 2009 photometric near-IR and optical observations were carried out with REM (Zerbi et al. 2004), a robotic\n\n6\n\n6.

At one of the two foci, the telescope simultaneously\nfeeds, by means of a dichroic, two cameras: REMIR for the nearIR (Conconi et al. 2004) and ROSS (Tosti et al. 2004) for the\noptical. Both cameras have a field of view of 10 \u00d7 10 arcmin\nand imaging capabilities with the usual near-IR (z, J, H, and\nK) and Johnson-Cousins VRI filters. The REM software system\n(Covino et al. 2004) is able to manage complex observational\nstrategies in a fully autonomous way. All raw near-IR/optical\nframes obtained with the REM telescope were then corrected for\ndark, bias, and flat field following standard recipes. Instrumental\nmagnitudes were obtained via aperture photometry and absolute\ncalibration has been performed by means of secondary standard\nstars in the field (see Raiteri et al. 1998; Smith and Balonek\n1998). The data presented here were obtained by GO program\nfor AOT19 (PI: F. D'Ammando).

From linear regression fits\nwe obtain highly superluminal apparent separation velocities\nbetween 16c and 20c, consistent with the separation speed\nderived for other knots (e.g. Homan et al. 2002), and at different\nfrequency (Marscher et al. 2010), indicating an intrinsic separation velocity \u03b2intr > 0.9989 and an orientation with the line of\nsight \u03b8 < 5\u25e6 .\nFrom the pc-scale resolution images we could separate the\ncore flux density from the jet emission, in order to study\nthe lightcurve and polarization properties of each of them.\nBetween 2007 and 2010, three main episodes of enhanced\nradio luminosity have been detected, successively followed by\nmarked flux density decreases. By contrast, no obvious trend of\nthe polarization percentage has been found.\nAfter March 2009, the flux density of the core region, that was\nin a minimum, started to increase, while the flux density of the\njet component did not show any significant luminosity changes.\nA remarkable aspect observed just after the March 2009 flare\nis the abrupt change of about 75\u25e6 in the polarization angle of\nthe core, whereas the fractional polarization remains constant.\nMore details on the long-term radio monitoring of this source\nare presented in Orienti et al. (2010).\n\n2\n\nC\n\n1\n\n0\n\n7. VLBA observations: data analysis and results\nWhen observed with the high spatial resolution provided by\nthe Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) technique,\nPKS 1510\u2212089 shows a radio structure dominated by the core\nregion from which the pc-scale jet emerges forming an angle\nof \u221228\u25e6 , i.e. in the north-west direction. Monitoring campaigns\npointed out the ejection of new superluminal components, and\nfollowed their evolution throughout several observing epochs\n(see Marscher et al. 2010).\nAs part of the MOJAVE program (Lister et al. 2009), PKS\n1510\u2212089 is frequently observed with the VLBA at 15 GHz\n(see Fig. 5). To study variations in the source structure, we\nretrived the uv-datasets and we imported them into NRAO AIPS\npackage. Final images both in total intensity and polarization\nhave been produced after a few phase-only self-calibration\niterations (for more details on calibration and image analysis\nsee Orienti et al. 2010).

Thermal signatures in the radio-to-UV spectrum\n\nEvidence of thermal emission in blazars has been detected in a\nlimited number of objects until now, and usually observed during\nlow activity states (e.g. 3C 279, Pian et al. 1999; 3C 273, Grandi\n& Palumbo 2004; 3C 454.3, Raiteri et al. 2007; AO 0235+164,\nRaiteri et al. 2008; NRAO 150, Acosta-Pulido et al. 2010). This\nis because, contrary to the other AGNs, in blazars the jet emission at small angles with respect to the line of sight of the observer is strongly amplified due to the relativistic beaming effect, overwhelming all the thermal contributions. However, these\nthermal features are less prominent in blazars but not absent, at\nleast for FSRQs, which present a radiatively efficient accretion\ndisk and broad emission lines.\nThe knowledge of these thermal features could have important consequences not only for the low-energy part of the\nspectrum, in which the thermal emission could be directly observed, but also for the high-energy part of the spectrum, because\nthe photons produced by the accretion disk, directly or through\nthe reprocessing by the broad line region (BLR) or the dusty\ntorus, can become the main source of seed photons for the EC\nmechanism that usually dominates the \u03b3-ray emission of FSRQs\n(Ghisellini et al. 1998).\nIn this context PKS 1510\u2212089 seems to be peculiar. Since\nthe synchrotron peak of this source is usually observed in midinfrared band (see Bach et al. 2007; Nieppola et al. 2008), the\noptical/UV part of the spectrum is not dominated by the nonthermal jet emission, allowing us to observe directly the thermal manifestation of both the accretion disk (the so-called \"big\nblue bump\", e.g. Laor 1990) and of the BLR (the so-called \"little blue bump\", e.g. Wills et al. 1985) also during high activity\nstates, like in mid-March 2008 (see D'Ammando et al. 2009a).\nMoreover, an excess at far-IR wavelengths was observed in PKS\n1510\u2212089 by IRAS (Tanner et al. 1996), likely due to dust radiation from the torus. Recently, Spitzer observations of PKS\n1510\u2212089 produced only an upper limit of 2 \u00d7 1045 erg s\u22121 to\nthe thermal emission from dust torus (Malmrose et al. 2011).\nIn order to distinguish between non-thermal and thermal emission contributions, we built spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from radio to UV with GASP-WEBT, REM and\nSwift/UVOT data. Conversion of magnitudes into de-reddened\nflux densities was obtained by adopting the Galactic absorption\nvalue AB = 0.416 from Schlegel et al. (1998), the extinction laws\nby Cardelli et al. (1989) and the magnitude-flux calibrations by\nBessell et al. (1998).\nAs for the Swift/UVOT data, we noticed that PKS 1510\u2212089\nhas a b-v \u223c 0.3 that is out of the validity range indicated by\nPoole et al. (2008) for their flux calibrations in the UV bands.\nHence, following Raiteri et al. (2010, 2011) we calculated effective wavelengths \u03bbeff , count rate to flux density conversion factors CF, and amount of Galactic extinction A\u039b for each UVOT\nband, by folding the quantities of interest with the source spectrum and effective areas of UVOT filters. The results are shown\nin Table 3.\nUVOT count rates were thus converted into flux densities\nand then corrected for Galactic extinction adopting the CF and\nA\u039b reported in Table 3. In Figure 6 we display three SEDs of\nMarch 2009 as well as the March 2008 SED already published\nby D'Ammando et al. (2009a). The comparison between the\nMarch 2008 SED obtained with standard calibrations (Figure 3\nof D'Ammando et al. 2009a) and the same SED obtained by\napplying the procedure described above reveals that the dip in\nthe uvw1 band remains, though it is now less pronounced. This\n8\n\nTable 3.

Indeed, we expect the little blue\nbump due to BLR emission (MgII, FeII, and Balmer lines) to\npeak in the u\u2013b frequency range. Near-IR to UV spectra of PKS\n1510\u2212089 in March 2009 have also been presented by Abdo et\nal. (2010a), but for a different choice of epochs, which prevents\na detailed comparison with our results. However, as expected,\nwe notice a deeper w1 dip than that we obtained with our more\naccurate calibrations.\nIn other FSRQs, such as 3C 454.3, the presence of the little\nand big blue bumps was detected only during low activity state\nof the source (see Raiteri et al. 2008, Vercellone et al. 2010).\nInstead, the SED of PKS 1510\u2212089 collected on 18 March 2009\nconfirmed the evidence of thermal signatures in the optical/UV\nspectrum of the source also during high \u03b3-ray states, with a contribution in the optical part likely due to the little blue bump\nand a significant rise of the spectrum at UV due to the accretion\ndisk emission, as already observed on 20\u201322 March 2008. On\nthe other hand, the broad band spectrum of PKS 1510\u2212089 from\nradio-to-UV during 25\u201326 March 2009 shows a flat spectrum\nin the optical/UV energy band, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission in this part of the spectrum\nduring the brightest \u03b3-ray flaring episode and therefore a significant shift of the synchrotron peak, usually observed in this\nsource in the infrared band. We derived an estimate of the frequency of the synchrotron peak in the three SEDs applying a\n\nFig. 6. SEDs of the low-energy part of the spectrum constructed\nwith data collected by GASP-WEBT (empty circle), KVA (plus\nsign), Abastumani (cross), St. Petersburg (asteriks), Campo\nImperatore (diamonds), REM (squares), and Swift/UVOT (filled\ncircles) during March 2008 and March 2009. A cubic polynomial fit was applied to the SEDs for locating the position of the\nsynchrotron peak.\n\n\fF. D'Ammando et al.: AGILE detection of extreme \u03b3-ray activity from the blazar PKS 1510\u2212089 during March 2009\n\ncubic polynomial fit (see e.g. Kubo et al. 1998) to the radio and\nIR data, which are likely due to pure synchrotron, as shown in\nFig. 6. The synchrotron peak shifted from \u03bd = 1.5 \u00d7 1013 Hz to \u03bd\n= 6.5 \u00d7 1013 Hz between 18 and 26 March 2009. Similarly to the\nharder-when-brighter behaviour observed in X-rays, this is a typical behaviour of high-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs) and\nnot so commonly observed in FSRQs such as PKS 1510\u2212089,\neven if this could be partially due to the fact that it is more difficult to obtain a long term monitoring of the synchrotron peak of\nFSRQs in the IR band with respect to the optical/UV and X-ray\nband.\nAbdo et al. (2010a) analyzing the UVOT data of PKS\n1510\u2212089 with standard calibrations (and thus with possible biases in the results, see above) found an anticorrelation between\nUV flux and UV hardness ratio in the period January-June 2009,\nsuggesting a different level of contamination in UV by the highenergy branch of synchrotron emission depending on the activity\nlevel. This is in agreement with our results, even if the importance of the increase of the synchrotron emission observed at the\nend of March 2009 seems to be much higher with respect to the\ngeneral trend.\nThe UVOT data reported in the SED of 25\u201326 March 2009\nare collected at JD = 2454916.46, instead the BVRI data are\ncollected by St. Petersburg at JD = 2454916.51-53, thus the separation in time between UVOT and BVRI data is about 1 hour.\nThis rules out the possible bias related to the optical/UV variability of the object, confirming the flat optical/UV spectrum.\nThe NIR data for the same SED are collected by REM at JD =\n2454916.66, about 3.5 hrs after the optical data and 4.5 hrs after\nthe UVOT data. In this case it is not possible to completely rule\nout a mismatch due to the possible rapid optical/UV variability, but by comparison with the NIR data collected during 20-22\nMarch 2008 and 18 March 2009, it is evident the change of the\nNIR spectrum, in agreement with what we observed also in optical/UV. Moreover the comparison between the optical/UV data\ncollected by UVOT on 25 March 2009, during the first UVOT\nexposure (JD \u223c 2454916.1, orange squares in Fig. 6) and those\ntaken about 9\u201310 hours after (JD \u223c 2454916.5, green triangles),\nreveals a noticeable spectral and flux variation. Considering that\nthe accretion disk is slowly variable on such short timescales,\nthis is another proof of the fact that the rapid increase of the optical emission started on 25 March and peaking on 27 March is\nmainly due to the synchrotron mechanism. This is also in full\nagreement with the simultaneous rapid increase of the degree of\noptical polarization shown in Marscher et al. 2010 (see in particular their Fig. 4). Thermal emission is unpolarized as it reflects\nthe random walk of atoms and ions within the emitting region,\ntherefore such increase of the degree of polarization is a clear\nsignature of a rapid and strong increase of the contribution in\nthe optical band of a non-thermal mechanism such as the synchrotron emission.\n8.2. Light curve behaviour and correlations\n\nBy comparing the source behaviour observed in \u03b3-rays by\nAGILE with the ones observed from optical-to-UV by GASPWEBT, REM and Swift/UVOT during March 2009 we noted\nthat while the \u03b3-ray light curve shows evidence of different outbursts of increasing entity, the optical and UV light curves seem\nto show a gradual increase of the flux in time with a rapid flux\nenhancement after JD \u223c 2454915.0 and a single major outburst\noccurred between JD 2454917.25 and JD 2454917.60. A variation of 0.48 mag in 9 days (JD 2454906-2454915) was detected\nin the R-band light curve, followed by a more rapid variation of\n\n0.95 mag in \u223c 2 days. The uvw1 light curve shows a similar behaviour, with a variation of 0.43 mag in 7 days and 0.78 mag\nin the following 2 days. The larger increase observed in R-band\nwith respect to uvw1 band is in agreement with a larger contribution of the synchrotron emission in the optical than in the\nUV band. A linear fit applied to the R-band and uvw1-band light\ncurves in Fig. 3 shows a change of slope after JD = 2454915.\nThe optical/UV peak seems to be delayed with respect to the\nbrightest \u03b3-ray peak by 1\u20132 days, although we cannot exclude a\nvery rapid optical/UV flare occurred during the gap in the optical\nand UV light curves before JD 2454917.25.\nAnother possibility is that the delay between optical and \u03b3ray emission is due to our choice of the T 0 used for building\nthe \u03b3-ray daily light curve. To investigate the influence of the T 0\non the determination of the \u03b3-ray peak we constructed three different light curves, considering an integration interval of 1 day\nand shifting the T 0 of \u2206T1 = 8 hours and \u2206T2 =16 hours with\nrespect to our initial choice (T 0 = 0:00 UT). In Fig. 7 the optical (R-band), UV (w1 filter) and the three \u03b3-ray light curves\nbuilt with the different T 0 in the period 21\u201331 March 2009 (labelled as I, II and III) are shown. For each \u03b3-ray light curve we\nassign a weight \"1\" to the three fractional 8-hours bins that constitute the total 1-day bin with the highest flux and a weight \"0\"\nto the other fractional bins. Combining the information derived\nfrom the three light curves we can build a probability function\nand estimate the fractional bin that corresponds with the highest\nprobability to the emission peak. In this way we estimated the\n\u03b3-ray emission peak at JD = 2454916.33 \u00b1 1.00, leading to a\nreduced delay between \u03b3-ray and optical/UV emission, in accordance also with the delay between the Fermi-LAT and optical\nlight curve peaks showed in Abdo et al. (2010a) for the same period. Moreover, we note that a recent investigation of the FermiLAT data of PKS 1510\u2212089 collected in the first half of 2009\nby Tavecchio et al. (2010) showed significant \u03b3-ray variability\non timescales of 6 hours and a flux peak on JD = 2454917.25,\ncompatible with our result.\nHowever, a significant increase of the optical/UV emission\nis detected only for the brightest \u03b3-ray flare, whereas the optical/UV activity before JD \u223c 2454915 was increasing but only\nslowly, according to a dominant contribution of the thermal\nemission, over which a subsequent rapid variability of the synchrotron emission is superimposed (see Sec. 8.1). A progressive\nincrease of the source activity, similar to the behaviour of the optical light curve collected by GASP-WEBT, was observed also\nin the near-IR and optical bands by the REM telescope (Fig. 3),\nsuggesting that the synchrotron is the dominant mechanism responsible for the flux enhancement observed from near-IR to\nUV at the end of March 2009. In this context, the lag of 13\u00b11\ndays between the \u03b3-ray and the optical peaks reported in Abdo\net al. (2010a) could suggest a different origin of the dominant\ncomponent in optical band during the January and April 2009\nflares with respect to the flare occurred at the end of March 2009.\nThis is another clue in favour of a more complex correlation between the optical and \u03b3-ray emission in the FSRQs, in which\nthe optical emission could be due to the contribution of both the\nsynchrotron emission and the thermal accretion disk emission.\nDespite the different dominant contribution in the optical part of\nthe spectrum, a similar photon index was observed by AGILE in\nthe \u03b3-ray spectrum during the first activity period (9\u201316 March)\nand the highest activity period (23-27 March), suggesting that\nthe same radiation mechanism is responsible for the high energy\nemission of the source over the whole observing period.\nMoreover, it is worth noting that the variability amplitude observed at the end of March 2009 is similar in optical (a factor of\n9\n\n\fF.

If the \u03b3 rays were produced\nby inverse Compton scattering of photons reprocessed by the\nBLR, as suggested by Abdo et al. (2010a), the \u03b3-ray emission\nwould be proportional to the number of the emitting electrons,\nlike the synchrotron flux. Therefore, the nearly linear correlation\nobserved between optical and \u03b3 rays may be due to the variation\nof the electron number in the jet. In this context, the lag of 1 day\nof the optical peak with respect to the \u03b3-ray one could be only\nan upper limit due to the lack of data before the observed optical\npeak.\nCompared to the optical and \u03b3-ray activity, the X-ray flux is\nnot very variable and does not seem to be correlated with the\nhigh \u03b3-ray activity (see Fig. 7, panel c). The lack of evident Xray/\u03b3-ray correlation is not so surprising. In fact, Marscher et\nal. (2010) already reported that the long-term X-ray light curve\nof PKS 1510\u2212089 collected during the 2006\u20132009 period by\nRossi X-ray Timing Explorer is significantly correlated with the\n14.5 GHz one rather than with the \u03b3-ray emission. This evidence\ncould be justified by the fact that the X-ray photons are likely\nto originate mostly in the low-energy part of the EC emission.\nTherefore the X-ray spectral index seems to reflect the change in\nthe low-energy tail of the electron distribution, whereas a change\nin the high-energy part of the electron distribution should be the\ndriver of the variation of the \u03b3-ray flux, as already pointed out by\n10\n\nAbdo et al. (2010a). Moreover, as already discussed in Kataoka\net al. (2008) and D'Ammando et al. (2009a), the spectral evolution of PKS 1510\u2212089 could be justified by the contamination\nat low energies of a second emission component with respect\nto the EC emission. In this case the X-ray spectral shape of the\nEC component should remain almost constant, regardless of the\nactivity level, but its flux should vary. Therefore the amount of\ncontamination of the second component should change, being\nmore important when the source is fainter and almost hidden by\nthe EC component when the source is brighter. Possible origins\nproposed for this second component are the soft X-ray excess,\nthe bulk Comptonization or a more significant contribution of\nthe SSC component in any activity states. A possible hint of increase of activity in X-rays is detected by XRT on 28 March and\nthis could be an indication of an enhancement of the contribution\nof the synchrotron self Compton (SSC) emission, strictly related\nto the optical/UV outburst observed on 27 March. The strength\nof the SSC with respect to EC emission depends on the ratio between the synchrotron and the external radiation energy density,\n\u2032\n\u2032\nas measured in the comoving frame, Usyn\n/Uext\n. Taking into account that, under the assumption that the dissipation region is\n\u2032\nwithin the BLR, Usyn\ndepends on the injected power, the size\nof the emission and the magnetic field, a larger magnetic field\ncan lead to a larger SSC contribution together with an increase\nand a shift of the synchrotron peak. By contrast, an increase of\nthe SSC emission should lead to a not negligible contribution of\nthis component, which usually shows a photon index of \u0393 \u223c 2\nin X-rays for the FSRQs, and therefore a softening of the total\nX-ray spectrum. Instead a hard X-ray spectrum was observed by\nXRT (\u0393 x = 1.31 \u00b1 0.14 on 28 March), confirming that also during a contemporaneous synchrotron flare the SSC contribution\nis not significant in the X-ray spectrum of PKS 1510\u2212089, as\nalready observed by Suzaku during a low state of the source in\n2009 (Abdo et al. 2010c).\nAn alternative scenario is that the electrons radiating at 14.5\nGHz produce X-rays via IC scattering of the IR photons from\na dust torus. This interpretation favours the \"far dissipation\"\nscenario recently proposed again for the emission of FSRQs\nby Sikora et. (2008) and Marscher et al. (2010), in which the\nhigh energy peak is mainly due to the EC scattering of the IR\nseed photons produced by the torus. In particular, Marscher et\nal. (2010) identified the dissipation zone with a moving superluminal knot before and after passing the core, which is interpreted\nas the first recollimation shock visible at millimeter wavelengths\nin the jet.\nIt is crucial to discriminate between these two scenarios in\norder to understand where the plasma blob dissipates in the jet.\nIn fact, the energy density of the different sources of seed photons varies with the distance from the central black hole, therefore the dominant population of target photons depends on the\nsite of the dissipation region that produces the flaring episode.\nThe determination of the location of the emitting region in the\njet of blazars is an open issue, in particular for FSRQs. However,\nthe rapid variability observed in the \u03b3-ray light curve of PKS\n1510\u2212089 collected by AGILE in March 2009 (even more remarkable in the Fermi-LAT light curves on timescales of hours,\nAbdo et al. (2010a), Tavecchio et al. 2010) puts severe constraints on the size of the emitting region, leading to a very\ncompact region difficult to be explained if the \u03b3-ray emission\nis produced far away from the central black hole. This seems\nto disfavour the \"far dissipation\" scenario. On the other hand,\nthe recent detection of this source at TeV energies by H.E.S.S.\n(Wagner and Behera 2010) suggests possible complex scenarios.\nWe can envisage that more than one emission region is simulta-\n\n\fF. D'Ammando et al.: AGILE detection of extreme \u03b3-ray activity from the blazar PKS 1510\u2212089 during March 2009\n\nneously active and located at different distance from the central\nblack hole in a spine-sheath (Tavecchio and Ghisellini 2008) or\njet-in-jet structure (Giannios et al. 2009).\nIt is worth noting that the outburst detected by Swift/BAT\non 8\u20139 March 2009 occurred just at the beginning of the \u03b3-ray\nactivity observed by AGILE. On the other hand, no significant\nactivity is detected by BAT simultaneously with the \u03b3-ray flares\ndetected by AGILE.\nFinally, as shown in Figure 4, no clear sign of strong activity\nin radio bands is observed during March 2009, although the radio\ncoverage is sparse. However, the SMA data show an increase\nof about a factor of two between February and March 2009 at\nmillimeter wavelengths, similarly to the optical behaviour even\nif with a minor variation amplitude. Moreover, the radio data\nacquired at Mets\u00e4hovi at 37 GHz on a longer timescale show\nthat the increase of activity marginally observed also in Fig. 4,\nwhich starts at the beginning of March 2009 (JD \u223c 2454910),\nhas continued gradually in April\u2013May 2009, reaching a peak flux\ndensity of 4.02 Jy on 15 May 2009 (JD 2454969.4; see Abdo et\nal. 2010a). The increase of flux density observed at 37 and 230\nGHz confirms that the mechanism producing the \u03b3-ray flaring\nevents also interested the mm/cm emitting region with difference\nin time likely related to opacity effects, as already observed in\nMarch\u2013April 2008 during the period soon after the previous \u03b3ray flare of PKS 1510\u2212089 detected by AGILE (D'Ammando et\nal. 2009a).\nIn addition, the VLBA data show a minimum of the flux density of the core in March 2009 and since the rotation of the polarization angle of the core was very mild in March relative to\nnext 50 days, it is unlikely that the March \u03b3-ray flaring episodes\nare related to the the blob associated with later flares as in the\nMarscher et al. (2010) model.\n\n9. Summary and concluding remarks\nWe reported on the detection by AGILE-GRID of \u03b3-ray activity\nfrom the FSRQ PKS 1510\u2212089 during March 2009. AGILE data\nshowed an amazing \u03b3-ray activity, with several flaring episodes\nand a flux that reached on daily integration \u223c 700 \u00d7 10\u22128 photons\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 , the highest flux detected from this source until now\nand one of the highest detected from a blazar. No significant\nspectral changes are observed between the different \u03b3-ray flares\nin March 2009, indicating that the same mechanism is dominant\nfor the high energy emission of the source over all the period.\nThis \u03b3-ray activity triggered simultaneous multiwavelength\nobservations, which provided us a wide dataset for studying the\ncorrelation between the emission properties from radio to \u03b3 rays.\nAn increasing activity in near-IR and optical was observed, with\na strong flux enhancement after 24 March and a flaring episode\non 26-27 March 2009 observed by GASP-WEBT and REM, almost simultaneous to the brightest \u03b3-ray flare. By contrast, no\nclear signs of simultaneous high activity were detected from\nnear-IR to UV during the other \u03b3-ray flares observed by AGILE.\nThe broad band spectrum from radio-to-UV collected on 18\nMarch confirmed the evidence of thermal signatures, the little and big blue bumps, in the optical/UV spectrum of PKS\n1510\u2212089 also during high \u03b3-ray states, and not only during\nlow activity states as observed in other blazars. The radio-toUV spectrum on 25-26 March showed a flat spectrum in the\noptical/UV energy band, suggesting an important contribution\nof the synchrotron emission in this part of the spectrum during\nthe brightest \u03b3-ray flare and therefore a significant shift of the\nsynchrotron peak, in agreement with the rapid variation detected\nby UVOT and the drastic change of polarization angle observed\n\nin VLBA data simultaneously with the optical flare. The optical/UV spectra presented here clearly show the different contribution of the thermal and non-thermal components in the various\nphases of the \u03b3-ray activity of the source, with consequent theoretical implications on the modeling of the broad band spectrum\nto investigate. It will be important to continue the monitoring of\nthe source from IR to UV to know if the shift of the synchrotron\npeak observed in March 2009 is a rare event or not.\nThe Swift/XRT observations show no clear correlation between the X-ray and \u03b3-ray emission. This could be due to the\nfact that X-rays and \u03b3-rays are originated by EC emission of different parts of the electron distribution with different variability.\nOn the other hand, a hint of harder-when-brighter behaviour was\ndetected from the XRT observations suggesting the presence of\na second component in the soft X-ray part of the spectrum that\ncould be associated with the soft X-ray excess rather than to the\nvariation of the SSC contribution in different activity states of\nthe source.\nMoreover, the radio data show that an increase of the activity\nrelated to the \u03b3-ray activity started in March and peaked in AprilMay 2009, confirming that the mechanism producing the \u03b3-ray\nflare interested also the mm/cm emitting zone, with some delay\nlikely due to opacity effects.\nIn conclusion, the \u03b3-ray emission of PKS 1510\u2212089 shows a\ncomplex correlation with the other wavelengths, leading to different scenarios when modeling its broad band spectrum at different epochs. The multifrequency observations presented here\ngive new clues, but also offer new questions on the astrophysical mechanisms at work in this object. Further IR observations\ncan be important to test the \"far dissipation\" scenario in which\nthe IR photons are the dominant seed photons for the IC mechanism that produces the \u03b3-rays, and in this context the launch\nof Herschel (Pillbratt et al. 2010) opened a new window on the\ninfrared Universe and it will be very important also for the study\nof blazars (Gonzalez-Nuevo et al. 2010). Finally, the study of\nthe correlation between the \u03b3-ray activity and the variability of\noptical polarization provided new information on the jet structure, the location and the causes of the high-energy emission in\nPKS 1510\u2212089. A further piece of the puzzle can be added with\nthe launch of a X-ray polarimeter onboard any future X-ray missions (e.g. the New Hard X-ray Mission, Pareschi et al. 2010)\ngiving us a final answer to the real nature of the X-ray spectrum\nof this puzzling object.\nAcknowledgements.
