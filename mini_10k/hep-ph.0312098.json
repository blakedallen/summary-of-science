The relationship is\nQ = T3L + T3R +\n\n(B \u2212 L)\nY\n= T3L + .\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nQuarks and leptons transform under GLR . It is not always easy to embed low\nenergy quarks and leptons in representations of larger gauge groups. But for\nthe left-right symmetric case, GLR posesses natural representations to embed\nthe quarks and leptons of the standard model.\nqL = (u, d)L\nqR = (u, d)R\nlL = (\u03bd, e)L\nlR = (N, e)R\n\n\u223c\n\u223c\n\u223c\n\u223c\n\n(3, 2, 1, 1/3),\n(3, 1, 2, 1/3),\n(1, 2, 1, \u22121),\n(1, 1, 2, \u22121),\n\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere a new fermion, i.e. NR , has been added to fill the gap in lR doublet.\nThis is just the right handed neutrino. For three generations, there are three\nof them. The lightest mass eigenstate of this right handed triplet may decay\nviolating CP (Charge conjugation times Parity), to produce a tiny lepton\nasymmetry in early universe[7].\nIn previous left-right models1 , a scalar bidoublet transforming as (1, 2, 2, 0)\nwas included because then we get correct Yukawa couplings at the tree level\nleading to fermion masses. It is a natural choice if we want the quarks and\nleptons to have tree-level masses. But fermion mass problem seems to be a\nmuch more involved one. Fermions may not have got masses at the tree level\nat all. Instead they may have got masses from higher dimensional operators.\nThe details of such high scale physics could be so obscure to us at the moment, that one may have to resort to effective non-renormalizable operators\nof mass dimension more than four.\nSuppose however that we are only interested in the spontaneous breaking\nof SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L to U(1)em with vR >> vL , then the simplest\nway is to introduce two Higgs doublets transforming as\n0\n\u03a6L = (\u03c6+\nL , \u03c6L ) \u223c (1, 2, 1, 1),\n0\n\u03a6R = (\u03c6+\nR , \u03c6R ) \u223c (1, 1, 2, 1).\n1\n\nSee Ref[3] for models without (1,2,2,0)\n\n2\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\n\fSuppose we now do not admit any other scalar multiplet 2 . This situation can\nbe compared with to the situation in the standard model, where SU(2)L \u00d7\nU(1)Y is spontaneously broken down to U(1)em by a Higgs doublet and we\ndo not admit anything else in the scalar sector. In that case, we find that\nquark and charged-lepton masses are generated at tree level, but neutrinos\nobtain Majorana masses only through the dimension-five operator[2]. In our\ncase, in the absence of the bidoublet, all fermion masses, have their origin in\nsome kind of see-saw mechanism3 , as shown below. Using Eqs. (2) to (7), it\nis clear that the following two objects\n(lL \u03a6L ) = \u03bdL \u03c60L \u2212 eL \u03c6+\nL,\n(lR \u03a6R ) = NR \u03c60R \u2212 eR \u03c6+\nR,\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nare invariants under GLR . Hence we have the dimension-five operators given\nby\nfijR\nfijL\nLM =\n(liL \u03a6L )(ljL \u03a6L ) +\n(liR \u03a6R )(ljR \u03a6R ) + H.c.,\n(10)\n2\u039bM\n2\u039bM\nwhich will generate Majorana neutrino masses proportional to vL2 /\u039bM for \u03bdL\nand vR2 /\u039bM for NR . In addition, we have\nLD =\n\nfijD  \u0304 \u2217\n(liL \u03a6L )(ljR \u03a6R ) + H.c.,\n\u039bD\n\n(11)\n\nand the corresponding dimension-five operators which will generate Dirac\nmasses for all the quarks and charged leptons. Therefore the combination\n(\u03a6\u2217L \u03a6R ) behaves as an effective (1,2,2,0) scalar [5] eventhough we have forbidden (1,2,2,0) in our Higgs choice.\nBecause in left-right symmetric models, both left handed as well as right\nhanded projections of neutrino is available at our disposal, they can pair up\nand, from Eq. (11) we get the Dirac type mass of neutrino as,\n(mD )ij =\n\nfijD vL vR\n,\n\u039bD\n\n(12)\n\nhence \u03bdL gets a double seesaw Majorana [6] mass of order\nv 2 v 2 \u039bM\nm2D\nv 2 \u039bM\n\u223c L 2R 2 = L 2 ,\nmN\n\u039bD vR\n\u039bD\n2\n\n(13)\n\nThis Higgs choice was made previously by Babu and Mohapatra[3] in the context of\nthe strong CP problem\n3\nA summary of various mechanisms to obtain neutrino mass can be found in Ref. [4]\n\n3\n\n\fvL /GeV\n100\n100\n100\n91\n\n\u039bM /GeV\n1019\n1018\n1018\n1018\n\n\u039bD /GeV\n1016\n1016\n2 \u00d7 1016\n2 \u00d7 1016\n\nm\u03bd /eV\n1\n0.1\n0.025\n0.0207\n\nTable 1: Magnitudes of neutrino masses generated via double seesaw\nwhere in Eq. (13) we have used the usual single seesaw formula\nMlight = ML + mTDirac\n\n1\nmDirac .\nMR\n\n(14)\n\nm2\n\nNote that mND is much larger than vL2 /\u039bM \u2261 ML if \u039bD << \u039bM . Take for\nexample \u039bM to be the Planck scale of 1019 GeV and \u039bD to be the grandunification scale of 1016 GeV, then the neutrino mass scale is 1 eV for vL of\norder 100 GeV. We can also see that ML \u223c 10\u22126 eV can be safely neglected.\nThese masses are tabulated in Table 1. The difference between \u039bM and \u039bD\nmay be due to the fact that if we assign a global fermion number F to lL\nand lR , then LM has F = \u00b12 but LD has F = 0.\nSince the Dirac masses of quarks and charged leptons are also given by\nEq. (12), vR cannot be much below \u039bD . This means that SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L\nis broken at a very high scale to U(1)Y , and our model at low energy is just\nthe standard model. We do however have the extra right handed neutrinos\nNR with masses of order vR2 /\u039bM , i.e. below 1013 GeV, which are useful for\nleptogenesis, as is well-known.\n\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Prof. R.N.
