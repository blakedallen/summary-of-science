We\nprove a relative version of the Density Theorem regarding isomorphism in K-theory. We also\nsolve Swan's problem for the connected stable rank, in fact for an entire hierarchy of higher\nconnected stable ranks that we introduce.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe following useful criterion for K-theoretic isomorphism is known as the Density Theorem.\nInitial versions are due to Karoubi [16, p.109] and Swan [27, Sec.2.2 & 3.1]; see also Connes [6,\nAppendix 3]. The Density Theorem as stated below is taken from Bost [4, Thm.1.3.1].\nTheorem 1.1. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a dense and spectral morphism between Banach algebras.\nThen \u03c6 induces an isomorphism K\u2217 (A) \u2243 K\u2217 (B).\nA morphism \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is dense if \u03c6 has dense image, and spectral if spB (\u03c6(a)) = spA (a) for all\na \u2208 A. Throughout this paper, algebras and their (continuous) morphisms are assumed to be\nunital.\nWhile proving his version of the density theorem, Swan remarked [27, p.206] on the possibility\nthat, under the same hypotheses as in the Density Theorem, one has not only isomorphism in\nK-theory but also equality of stable ranks. That is, Swan's problem asks the following:\nQuestion 1. If \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is a dense and spectral morphism between Banach algebras, are the\nstable ranks of A and B equal?\nThere are many notions of stable rank in the literature, and the stable rank in the above\nproblem should be interpreted in a generic sense. Broadly speaking, stable ranks are noncommutative notions of dimension and they are related to stabilization phenomena in K-theory.\nThe stable ranks that are readily interpreted as noncommutative dimensions are the Bass stable rank (bsr) and the topological stable rank (tsr). As for stabilization in K-theory, the most\nnatural rank to consider is the connected stable rank (csr). We thus view Swan's problem for\nthe connected stable rank as the suitable companion to the K-theoretic isomorphism described\nby the Density Theorem.\nPartial results on Swan's problem were obtained by Badea [2]. Most significantly, bsr(A) =\nbsr(B) whenever A is a \"smooth\" subalgebra of a C\u2217 -algebra B [2, Thm.1.1, Cor.4.10]. Also,\ncsr(A) = csr(B) for A a dense and spectral subalgebra of a commutative Banach algebra B [2,\nDate: May 30, 2008.\nKey words and phrases. Spectral morphism, Density Theorem in K-theory, Swan's problem for the connected\nstable rank.\nSupported by FQRNT (Le Fonds qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de la recherche sur la nature et les technologies).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBOGDAN NICA\n\nThm.4.15]. As for the results concerning the topological stable rank, [2, Thm.4.13, Cor.4.14],\nthe hypotheses are unnatural.\nIn this paper we investigate a weaker notion of spectral morphism. A morphism \u03c6 : A \u2192 B\nis relatively spectral if spB (\u03c6(x)) = spA (x) for all x in some dense subalgebra X of A. We do\nnot know examples of relatively spectral morphisms that are not spectral. Most likely, examples\nexist and they are not obvious. If A enjoys some form of spectral continuity then a relatively\nspectral morphism \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is in fact spectral (Section 3.1).\nThe point of considering relatively spectral morphisms is that one can get by with less spectral\ninformation. For instance, when one compares two completions of a group algebra C\u0393, it\nsuffices to consider the spectral behavior of finitely-supported elements. The generalization of\nthe Density Theorem to the relatively spectral context reads as follows:\nTheorem 1.2. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a dense and completely relatively spectral morphism between\nBanach algebras. Then \u03c6 induces an isomorphism K\u2217 (A) \u2243 K\u2217 (B).\nFollowing a standard practice, we call a morphism \u03c6 : A \u2192 B completely relatively spectral\nif each amplified morphism Mn (\u03c6) : Mn (A) \u2192 Mn (B) is relatively spectral. It is known ([27,\nLem.2.1],[4, Prop.A.2.2], [25, Thm.2.1]) that spectrality is preserved under amplifications. More\nprecisely, if \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is a dense and spectral morphism then each Mn (\u03c6) : Mn (A) \u2192 Mn (B)\nis a dense and spectral morphism. We have been unable to prove a similar result for relatively\nspectral morphisms. Nevertheless, in concrete situations one often encounters a strong form of\nrelative spectrality which propagates to all matrix levels; see Section 8.2.\nThe surjectivity part in the Relative Density Theorem was known to Lafforgue ([19, Lem.3.1.1]\nand comments after [18, Cor.0.0.3]).\nNext we consider Swan's problem for the connected stable rank in the context of relatively\nspectral morphisms. The answer seems to be the most satisfactory result on Swan's problem so\nfar:\nTheorem 1.3. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a dense and relatively spectral morphism between Banach\nalgebras. Then csr(A) = csr(B).\nIn fact, we prove more. Homotopy stabilization phenomena that are intimately connected\nto stabilization in K-theory suggest the consideration of higher analogues of connected stable\nranks. We show that a relatively spectral, dense morphism preserves these higher connected\nstable ranks; see Proposition 6.15.\nThe Relative Density Theorem can also be considered in a more general context. We introduce\ncertain spectral K-functors K\u03a9 , indexed by open subsets \u03a9 \u2286 C containing the origin. For\nsuitable \u03a9, one recovers the usual K0 and K1 functors. We prove the Relative Density Theorem\nfor these spectral K-functors; see Proposition 7.9. A quick proof for the usual K-theory is given\nin Proposition 5.2.\nHandling Swan's problem for higher connected stable ranks and proving the Relative Density\nTheorem in spectral K-theory is in fact elementary and can be made rather short. The slogan is\nthat dense, relatively spectral morphisms behave well with respect to homotopy, for homotopy\nof open subsets is equivalent to piecewise-affine homotopy over a dense subalgebra.\nMost effort in the sections devoted to the spectral K-functors and the higher connected stable\nranks goes towards providing a context for these notions and investing them with meaning. The\nbasic motivation for introducing spectral K-functors is the need for an alternate picture of K0 ,\nin which the subset of idempotents is replaced by an open subset. As for the higher connected\nstable ranks, they are meant to substantiate our claim that, from the K-theoretic perspective,\nthe connected stable rank is the natural stable rank to be considered in Swan's problem. We\nbelieve that these two notions, spectral K-functors and higher connected stable ranks, are of\nindependent interest.\n\n\fRELATIVELY SPECTRAL MORPHISMS AND APPLICATIONS TO K-THEORY\n\n3\n\nAlthough we are mainly interested in Banach algebras, the results mentioned above are\nactually true for good Fr\u00e9chet algebras. Section 2 contains the basic facts on good Fr\u00e9chet\nalgebras that are used in this paper. In Section 3 we discuss relatively spectral morphisms. In\nSection 4 we show that dense, relatively spectral morphisms transfer the property of being a\nfinite algebra. Section 5 provides the key homotopy lemma used in proving the Relative Density\nTheorem and in settling Swan's problem for the higher connected stable ranks. We discuss the\nhigher connected stable ranks in Section 6, and the spectral K-functors in Section 7. We close\nwith some applications in Section 8.\nAcknowledgments. I would like to thank Guoliang Yu for useful discussions, and J\u00e1n \u0160pakula\nfor a careful reading of the paper. I am grateful to Qayum Khan for explaining me Lemma 6.6.\nThe fact that Lemma 6.6 holds for compact metric spaces was pointed out to me by Bruce\nHughes. Finally, I thank the referee for noticing a faulty argument in the original version.\n2. Good Fr\u00e9chet algebras\nFr\u00e9chet algebras appear naturally in Noncommutative Geometry [7]. A motivating example\nis C \u221e (M ), the Fr\u00e9chet algebra of smooth functions on a compact manifold M . The context of\ngood Fr\u00e9chet algebras, a context more general than that of Banach algebras, turns out to be\nthe most convenient for our purposes.\n2.1. Good topological algebras. The definition below uses the terminology of [4, Appendix]:\nDefinition 2.1. A topological algebra A is a good topological algebra if the group of invertibles\nA\u00d7 is open, and the inversion a 7\u2192 a\u22121 is continuous on A\u00d7 .\nThere are two key facts about good topological algebras that we need in what follows:\nProposition 2.2. If A is a good topological algebra then Mn (A) is a good topological algebra.\nProposition 2.3. Let A be a good topological algebra. Then:\ni) sp(a) is compact for all a \u2208 A;\nii) A\u03a9 = {a : sp(a) \u2286 \u03a9} is open in A whenever \u03a9 \u2286 C is an open set.\nProposition 2.2 is due to Swan [27, Cor.1.2]. The proof of Proposition 2.3 is easy and we\nomit it.\n2.2. Fr\u00e9chet algebras. In this paper, we adopt the following:\nDefinition 2.4. An algebra A is a Fr\u00e9chet algebra if A is equipped with a countable family of\nsubmultiplicative seminorms {k * kk }k\u22650 which make A into a Fr\u00e9chet space.\nWe do not require the seminorms to be unital. One can assume, without loss of generality,\nthat the countable family of seminorms in the previous definition is increasing.\nIf A is a Fr\u00e9chet algebra under the seminorms\n{k * kk }k\u22650 then Mn (A) is a Fr\u00e9chet algebra\nP\nunder the seminorms given by k(aij )kk = i,j kaij kk ; this will be the standard Fr\u00e9chet structure\non matrix algebras in what follows.\nEvery Fr\u00e9chet algebra can be realized as an inverse limit of Banach algebras; this is the Arens\n- Michael theorem. Indeed, let A be a Fr\u00e9chet algebra under the seminorms {k * kk }k\u22650 . Let Ak\nbe the Banach algebra obtained by completing A modulo the vanishing ideal of k * kk . We obtain\nan inverse system of Banach algebras withQdense connecting morphisms. Then A is isometrically\nisomorphic to the inverse limit lim Ak \u2286 Ak . Conversely, an inverse limit of Banach algebras\nQ\n\u2190\u2212\nis a Fr\u00e9chet algebra: the product Ak of the Banach algebras Ak has a natural Fr\u00e9chet algebra\nstructure given by the coordinate norms, which Fr\u00e9chet structure is inherited by the closed\nsubalgebra lim Ak .\n\u2190\u2212\n\n\f4\n\nBOGDAN NICA\n\nQ\nIt is easily checked that lim Ak is a spectral subalgebra of Ak , i.e., (ak ) \u2208 lim Ak is invertible\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2190\u2212\n\u0001\n\u0001\nin lim Ak if and only if each ak is invertible in Ak . Thus sp (ak ) = \u222ak spAk (ak ) and r (ak ) =\n\u2190\u2212\nsupk rAk (ak ) for (ak ) \u2208 lim Ak . In particular, if A is a Fr\u00e9chet algebra then sp(a) is nonempty\n\u2190\u2212\nfor all a \u2208 A. We also have the following\nProposition 2.5. Let A be a Fr\u00e9chet algebra. If rA (1 \u2212 a) < 1 then a \u2208 A\u00d7 .\nViewing a Fr\u00e9chet algebra A once again as an inverse limit of Banach algebras, it is apparent\nthat inversion is continuous on A\u00d7 . However, A\u00d7 may not be open. A simple example is C(R)\nwith the Fr\u00e9chet structure given by the seminorms kf kk = supx\u2208[\u2212k,k] |f (x)|. The invertible\ngroup of C(R), consisting of the non-vanishing continuous functions, is not open: if fk is a\ncontinuous function such that fk = 1 on [\u2212k, k] and fk = 0 outside [\u2212(k + 1), k + 1], then (fk )\nis a sequence of non-invertibles converging to 1.\nConsider, on the other hand, the Fr\u00e9chet algebra C \u221e (M ) of smooth functions\nP on a compact\nmanifold M . The Fr\u00e9chet structure on C \u221e (M ) is given by the norms kf kk = |\u03b1|\u2264k k\u2202 \u03b1 f k\u221e ,\ndefined using local charts on M . That C \u221e (M ) has an open group of invertibles follows by\nviewing C \u221e (M ) as a spectral, continuously-embedded subalgebra of the C\u2217 -algebra C(M ).\nIf X, Y are topological spaces then X(Y ) denotes the continuous maps from Y to X. Let \u03a3\nbe a compact Hausdorff space and let A be a Fr\u00e9chet algebra under the seminorms {k * kk }k\u22650 .\nThen A(\u03a3) is a Fr\u00e9chet algebra under the seminorms kf kk := supp\u2208\u03a3 kf (p)kk . As inversion is\ncontinuous in A\u00d7 , we have A(\u03a3)\u00d7 = A\u00d7 (\u03a3). Since V (\u03a3) is open in A(\u03a3) whenever V is an\nopen subset of A, we obtain in particular that A(\u03a3) is good whenever A is good.\nProposition 2.6. Let A be a good Fr\u00e9chet algebra, a \u2208 A and \u03a9 \u2286 C an open neighborhood of\nsp(a). Then there is a unique morphism O(\u03a9) \u2192 A sending id\u03a9 to a, given by\nI\n1\nf (\u03bb)(\u03bb \u2212 a)\u22121 d\u03bb\nOa (f ) = f (a) :=\n2\u03c0i\nwhere the integral is taken around a cycle (finite union of closed paths) in \u03a9 containing sp(a)\nin its interior. Furthermore, we have spf (a) = f (sp(a)) for each f \u2208 O(\u03a9).\nThe unique morphism indicated by the previous proposition is referred to as the holomorphic\ncalculus for a. Here O(\u03a9), the unital algebra of functions that are holomorphic in \u03a9, is endowed\nwith the topology of uniform convergence on compacts.\n3. Relatively spectral morphisms\nIn this section, we discuss relatively spectral morphisms. The emphasis is on the comparison\nbetween relatively spectral morphisms and spectral morphisms.\nRecall that a morphism \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is spectral if spB (\u03c6(a)) = spA (a) for all a \u2208 A; equivalently,\nfor a \u2208 A we have a \u2208 A\u00d7 \u21d4 \u03c6(a) \u2208 B \u00d7 . We are concerned with the following relative notion:\nDefinition 3.1. A morphism \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is spectral relative to a subalgebra X \u2286 A if spB (\u03c6(x)) =\nspA (x) for all x \u2208 X; equivalently, for x \u2208 X we have x \u2208 A\u00d7 \u21d4 \u03c6(x) \u2208 B \u00d7 . A morphism\n\u03c6 : A \u2192 B is relatively spectral if \u03c6 is spectral relative to some dense subalgebra of A.\nIf \u03c6 : A \u2192 B and \u03c8 : B \u2192 C are morphisms, then \u03c8\u03c6 is spectral relative to X if and only\nif \u03c6 is spectral relative to X and \u03c8 is spectral relative to \u03c6(X). This shows, in particular, that\nthe passage from surjective to dense morphisms naturally entails a passage from spectral to\nrelatively spectral morphisms. It also follows that a morphism \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is relatively spectral\nif and only if both the dense morphism \u03c6 : A \u2192 \u03c6(A) and the inclusion \u03c6(A) \u0592\u2192 B are relatively\nspectral (where \u03c6(A) is the closure of \u03c6(A) in B). In other words, relative spectrality has two\naspects: the dense morphism case and the closed-subalgebra case. We are interested in the\ndense morphism case in this paper.\n\n\fRELATIVELY SPECTRAL MORPHISMS AND APPLICATIONS TO K-THEORY\n\n5\n\nIn practice, the following criterion for relative spectrality is useful:\nProposition 3.2. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a dense morphism between good Fr\u00e9chet algebras. Let\nX \u2286 A be a dense subalgebra. The following are equivalent:\ni) spB (\u03c6(x)) = spA (x) for all x \u2208 X\nii) rB (\u03c6(x)) = rA (x) for all x \u2208 X.\nProof. i) \u21d2 ii) is trivial. For ii) \u21d2 i), let x \u2208 X with \u03c6(x) \u2208 B \u00d7 . Let (xn ) \u2286 X with\n\u03c6(xn ) \u2192 \u03c6(x)\u22121 . We have rB (1 \u2212 \u03c6(xn )\u03c6(x)) \u2192 0, that is, rA (1 \u2212 xn x) \u2192 0. In particular,\nxn x \u2208 A\u00d7 for large n so x is left-invertible. A similar argument shows that x is right-invertible.\nThus x \u2208 A\u00d7 .\n\u0003\nTypically, the domain of a dense, relatively spectral morphism cannot be a C\u2217 -algebra:\nLemma 3.3. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a \u2217-morphism, where A is a C\u2217 -algebra and B is a Banach\n\u2217-algebra. If \u03c6 is dense and spectral relative to a dense \u2217-subalgebra, then \u03c6 is an isomorphism.\nProof. Note first that \u03c6 is onto, as \u03c6(A) is both dense and closed. Let X be a dense \u2217-subalgebra\nof A relative to which \u03c6 is spectral. For x \u2208 X we have:\nkxk2A = kxx\u2217 kA = rA (xx\u2217 ) = rB (\u03c6(xx\u2217 )) \u2264 k\u03c6(xx\u2217 )kB \u2264 k\u03c6(x)k2B\nIt follows that kakA \u2264 k\u03c6(a)kB \u2264 CkakA for all a \u2208 A, where C > 0. Thus \u03c6 is an algebraic\nisomorphism, and \u03c6 can be made into an isometric isomorphism by re-norming B.\n\u0003\nLet us point out two disadvantages in working with relatively spectral morphisms.\nFirst, if \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is a spectral morphism between Fr\u00e9chet algebras and B is good, then A\nis good as well. If \u03c6 is only relatively spectral, then the knowledge that A is good has to come\nfrom elsewhere; that is why our applications in Section 8 involve Banach algebras only.\nSecond, spectrality is well-behaved under amplifications: if \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is a dense and spectral morphism then each Mn (\u03c6) : Mn (A) \u2192 Mn (B) is a dense and spectral morphism ([27,\nLem.2.1],[4, Prop.A.2.2], [25, Thm.2.1]). We have been unable to prove a similar result for\nrelatively spectral morphisms.\nQuestion 2. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a dense and relatively spectral morphism. Is Mn (\u03c6) : Mn (A) \u2192\nMn (B) a relatively spectral morphism for each n \u2265 1?\nWe thus have to introduce a stronger property that describes relative spectrality at all matrix\nlevels:\nDefinition 3.4. A morphism \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is completely spectral relative to a subalgebra X \u2286 A\nif each Mn (\u03c6) : Mn (A) \u2192 Mn (B) is spectral relative to Mn (X). A morphism \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is\ncompletely relatively spectral if each Mn (\u03c6) : Mn (A) \u2192 Mn (B) is relatively spectral.\nExample 3.5. Consider the dense inclusion l1 \u0393 \u0592\u2192 C\u2217r \u0393 for a finitely-generated amenable group\n\u0393.\nIf \u0393 has polynomial growth then l1 \u0393 \u0592\u2192 C\u2217r \u0393 is spectral (Ludwig [20]). On the other hand,\nif \u0393 contains a free subsemigroup on two generators then l1 \u0393 \u0592\u2192 C\u2217r \u0393 is not spectral (Jenkins\n[14]). In between these two results, say for groups of intermediate growth, it is unknown whether\nl1 \u0393 \u0592\u2192 C\u2217r \u0393 is spectral or not.\nTurning to relative spectrality, it is easy to see that l1 \u0393 \u0592\u2192 C\u2217r \u0393 is spectral relative to C\u0393 if\n\u0393 has subexponential growth. Indeed, we show that rl1 \u0393 (a) = rC\u2217r \u0393 (a) for a \u2208 C\u0393. We have\nrC\u2217r \u0393 (a) \u2264 rl1 \u0393 (a) from kak \u2264 kak1 , so it suffices to prove that rl1 \u0393 (a) \u2264 rC\u2217r \u0393 (a). If a \u2208 C\u0393 is\nsupported in a ball of radius R, then an is supported in a ball of radius nR. We then have\np\np\nkan k1 \u2264 vol B(nR)kan k2 \u2264 vol B(nR)kan k.\n\n\f6\n\nBOGDAN NICA\n\nTaking the n-th root and letting n \u2192 \u221e, we obtain rl1 \u0393 (a) \u2264 rC\u2217r \u0393 (a).\nThis example serves as a preview for Example 8.3, where we show that l1 \u0393 \u0592\u2192 C\u2217r \u0393 is in fact\ncompletely spectral relative to C\u0393, and for Section 8.3, where we investigate the groups \u0393 for\nwhich l1 \u0393 \u0592\u2192 C\u2217r \u0393 is spectral relative to C\u0393.\nIn general, it is hard to decide whether a relatively spectral morphism is spectral or not. For\ninstance, we do not know any examples of relatively spectral morphisms that are not spectral.\nUnder spectral continuity assumptions, however, it is easy to show that relatively spectral\nmorphisms are in fact spectral. We discuss this point in the next subsection.\n3.1. Spectral continuity. A relatively spectral morphism \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is described by a spectral\ncondition over a dense subalgebra of A. In the presence of spectral continuity, this spectral\ncondition can be then extended to the whole of A, i.e., \u03c6 is a spectral morphism. It might seem,\nat first sight, that both A and B need to have spectral continuity for this to work, but in fact\nspectral continuity for A suffices.\nSpectral continuity can be interpreted in three different ways. The strongest form is to view\nthe spectrum as a map from a good Fr\u00e9chet algebra to the non-empty compact subsets of the\ncomplex plane, and to require continuity of the spectrum with respect to the Hausdorff distance.\nRecall, the Hausdorff distance between two non-empty compact subsets of the complex plane is\ngiven by dH (C, C \u2032 ) = inf{\u03b5 > 0 : C \u2286 C\u03b5\u2032 , C \u2032 \u2286 C\u03b5 }, where C\u03b5 denotes the open \u03b5-neighborhood\nof C. Letting S denote the class of good Fr\u00e9chet algebras with continuous spectrum in this sense,\nwe have:\nProposition 3.6. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a relatively spectral morphism between good Fr\u00e9chet\nalgebras. If A \u2208 S then \u03c6 is spectral.\nProof. Let a \u2208 A; we need to show that spA (a) \u2286 spB (\u03c6(a)). Let \u03b5 > 0 and pick xn \u2192 a such\nthat spA (xn ) = spB (\u03c6(xn )). For n \u226b 1 we have spB (\u03c6(xn )) \u2286 spB (\u03c6(a))\u03b5 by Proposition 2.3\nii). On the other hand, the continuity of the spectrum in A gives spA (a) \u2286 spA (xn )\u03b5 for n \u226b 1.\nCombining these two facts, we get spA (a) \u2286 spA (xn )\u03b5 = spB (\u03c6(xn ))\u03b5 \u2286 spB (\u03c6(a))2\u03b5 for n \u226b 1.\nAs \u03b5 is arbitrary, we are done.\n\u0003\nThe usefulness of Proposition 3.6 is limited by the knowledge about the class S. There are\nsurprisingly few results on S; we did not find in the literature any results complementing the\nones contained in Aupetit's survey [1]. The following list summarizes the results mentioned by\nAupetit:\na) if A is a commutative Banach algebra then A is in S\nb) if A is a commutative Banach algebra and B is a Banach algebra in S, then the projective\ntensor product A \u2297 B is in S ([1, Thm.5, p.139])\nc) if A is a commutative Banach algebra then Mn (A) \u2208 S ([1, Cor.1, p.139])\nd) if A is a Banach algebra in S, then every closed subalgebra of A is in S ([1, Thm.3, p.138])\nA result of Kakutani says that B(H), the algebra of bounded operators on an infinitedimensional Hilbert space, is not in S ([1, p.34]).\nThe second form of spectral continuity, weaker than the one above, is adapted to \u2217-algebras.\nWe now require continuity of the spectrum (with respect to the Hausdorff distance) on selfadjoint elements only. Denoting by Ssa the class of good Fr\u00e9chet \u2217-algebras whose spectrum is\ncontinuous on the self-adjoint elements, we have:\nProposition 3.7. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a relatively spectral \u2217-morphism between good Fr\u00e9chet\n\u2217-algebras. If A \u2208 Ssa then \u03c6 is spectral.\nProof. Arguing as in the proof of Proposition 3.6, we see that spA (a\u2217 a) = spB (\u03c6(a\u2217 a)) for all\na \u2208 A. Let a \u2208 A with \u03c6(a) \u2208 B \u00d7 . Then \u03c6(a\u2217 a), \u03c6(aa\u2217 ) \u2208 B \u00d7 , and the previous equality of\nspectra gives a\u2217 a, aa\u2217 \u2208 A\u00d7 . Therefore a \u2208 A\u00d7 .\n\u0003\n\n\fRELATIVELY SPECTRAL MORPHISMS AND APPLICATIONS TO K-THEORY\n\n7\n\nAccording to [1, Cor.4, p.143], symmetric Banach \u2217-algebras are in Ssa . Recall that a Banach\n\u2217-algebra is symmetric if every self-adjoint element has real spectrum. We obtain:\nCorollary 3.8. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a relatively spectral \u2217-morphism between Banach \u2217-algebras.\nIf A is symmetric then \u03c6 is spectral.\nThe third meaning that one can give to spectral continuity is continuity of the spectral radius.\nLet R denote the class of good Fr\u00e9chet algebras with continuous spectral radius. Continuity of\nthe spectrum (with respect to the Hausdorff distance) implies continuity of the spectral radius,\nthat is, S \u2286 R; the inclusion is strict ([1, p.38]). Kakutani's result, mentioned above, actually\nsays that B(H) is not in R.\nProposition 3.9. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a dense and relatively spectral morphism between good\nFr\u00e9chet algebras. If A \u2208 R then \u03c6 is spectral.\nProof. The proof is very similar to that of Proposition 3.6. Let a \u2208 A; we show that rA (a) \u2264\nrB (\u03c6(a)). For then Proposition 3.2 allows us to conclude that \u03c6 is spectral. Let \u03b5 > 0 and pick\nxn \u2192 a such that rA (xn ) = rB (\u03c6(xn )). For n \u226b 1 we have rB (\u03c6(xn )) \u2264 rB (\u03c6(a)) + \u03b5, i.e.,\nrA (xn ) \u2264 rB (\u03c6(a)) + \u03b5. Letting n \u2192 \u221e and using the continuity of the spectral radius in A, we\nget rA (a) \u2264 rB (\u03c6(a)) + \u03b5. As \u03b5 is arbitrary, we are done.\n\u0003\nFinally, note that if B satisfies one of the above forms of spectral continuity and \u03c6 : A \u2192 B\nis spectral, then A satisfies that spectral continuity as well.\n4. Finiteness\nRecall that an algebra A is finite if the left-invertibles of A are actually invertible, equivalently,\nif the right-invertibles of A are actually invertible. This terminology is standard in the Banachand C\u2217 -algebraic setting; in noncommutative ring theory, this property is called Dedekindfiniteness. An algebra A is stably finite if each matrix algebra Mn (A) is finite. Tracial C\u2217 -algebras\nare important examples of stably finite algebras. Stable-finiteness is relevant in K-theory, for it\nguarantees the non-vanishing of K0 .\nProposition 4.1. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a dense morphism between good topological algebras.\na) Assume \u03c6 is relatively spectral. Then A is finite if and only if B is finite.\nb) Assume \u03c6 is completely relatively spectral. Then A is stably finite if and only if B is stably\nfinite.\nProof. We prove a). Part b) is an obvious corollary.\nLetting L(A) denote the left-invertibles of A, note that the density of A\u00d7 in L(A) suffices\nfor finiteness. Indeed, if a \u2208 L(A) then un \u2192 a for some invertibles un . There is a\u2032 \u2208 A with\na\u2032 a = 1, so a\u2032 un \u2192 1. Hence a\u2032 un \u2208 A\u00d7 for large n, thus a\u2032 \u2208 A\u00d7 and we conclude a \u2208 A\u00d7 .\nLet X be a dense subalgebra of A relative to which \u03c6 is spectral.\nAssume B is finite. Let a \u2208 L(A) and let xn \u2192 a where xn \u2208 X. Then \u03c6(xn ) \u2192 \u03c6(a) \u2208\nL(B) = B \u00d7 so, by relative spectrality, xn is eventually invertible. Thus A\u00d7 is dense in L(A).\nAssume A is finite. We claim that \u03c6(L(A)) is dense in L(B); as \u03c6(L(A)) = \u03c6(A\u00d7 ) \u2286 B \u00d7 \u2286\nL(B), it will follow that B \u00d7 is dense in L(B). Let b \u2208 L(B) with b\u2032 b = 1. Pick sequences (xn ),\n(x\u2032n ) in X so that \u03c6(xn ) \u2192 b, \u03c6(x\u2032n ) \u2192 b\u2032 . Since \u03c6(x\u2032n xn ) \u2192 1, relative spectrality gives that xn\nis left-invertible for large n. This proves that \u03c6(L(A)) is dense in L(B).\n\u0003\n5. A homotopy lemma\nWe adapt Proposition A.2.6 of [4] as follows:\n\n\f8\n\nBOGDAN NICA\n\nLemma 5.1. Let A, B be Fr\u00e9chet spaces and \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a continuous linear map with dense\nimage. Let U \u2286 A, V \u2286 B be open with \u03c6(U ) \u2286 V . If X is a dense subspace of A such that\nU \u2229 X = \u03c6\u22121 (V ) \u2229 X then \u03c6 induces a weak homotopy equivalence between U and V .\nProof. First, we show that \u03c6 induces a bijection \u03c00 (U ) \u2192 \u03c00 (V ). We make repeated use of\nthe local convexity. For surjectivity, pick v \u2208 V . As V is open and \u03c6(X) is dense, there is\nvX \u2208 V \u2229 \u03c6(X) such that v and vX can be connected by a segment in V . If uX \u2208 X is a\npre-image of vX , then uX \u2208 U . For injectivity, let u, u\u2032 \u2208 U such that \u03c6(u), \u03c6(u\u2032 ) are connected\nin V . As U is open and X is dense, there are uX , u\u2032X \u2208 U \u2229 X such that u and uX , respectively\nu\u2032 and u\u2032X , can be connected by a segment in U . That is, we may assume that we start with\nu, u\u2032 \u2208 U \u2229 X. As V is open and \u03c6(X) is dense, if \u03c6(u) and \u03c6(u\u2032 ) can be connected by a path in\nV then they can be connected by a piecewise-linear path pB lying entirely in V \u2229 \u03c6(X). Take\npre-images in X for the vertices of pB and extend to a piecewise-linear path pA connecting u\nto u\u2032 . Since the path pA lies in X and is mapped inside V , it follows that pA lies in U . We\nconclude that u, u\u2032 are connected in U .\nNext, let k \u2265 1. We show that \u03c6 induces a bijection \u03c0k (U, a) \u2192 \u03c0k (V, \u03c6(a)) for each a \u2208 U .\nUp to translating U by \u2212a and V by \u2212\u03c6(a), we may assume that a = 0. Fix a basepoint \u2022 on\nS k . The dense linear map \u03c6 : A \u2192 B induces a dense linear map \u03c6k : A(S k ) \u2192 B(S k ), which\nrestricts to a dense linear map \u03c6\u2022k : A(S k )\u2022 \u2192 B(S k )\u2022 . The \u2022-decoration stands for restricting\nto the based maps sending \u2022 to 0. With U (S k )\u2022 , V (S k )\u2022 , X(S k )\u2022 playing the roles of U , V ,\nX, we get by the first part that \u03c6\u2022k induces a bijection \u03c00 (U (S k )\u2022 ) \u2192 \u03c00 (V (S k )\u2022 ). That means\nprecisely that \u03c6 induces a bijection \u03c0k (U, 0) \u2192 \u03c0k (V, 0).\nLet us give some details on the previous paragraph. That A(S k )\u2022 , respectively B(S k )\u2022 , is a\nFr\u00e9chet space follows by viewing it as a closed subspace of the Fr\u00e9chet space A(S k ), respectively\nB(S k ). The map \u03c6k : A(S k ) \u2192 B(S k ) is given by \u03c6k (f ) = \u03c6 \u25e6 f , and it is obviously linear\nand continuous. Consequently, the restriction \u03c6\u2022k : A(S k )\u2022 \u2192 B(S k )\u2022 is linear and continuous.\nThe fact that X(S k )\u2022 is dense in A(S k )\u2022 is showed using a partition of unity argument. This\nalso proves the density of \u03c6k and \u03c6\u2022k . Next, U (S k ) is open in A(S k ) (see comments before\nProposition\u0001 2.6) so U (S k )\u2022 is open in A(S k )\u2022 ; similarly, V (S k )\u2022\u0001 is open in B(S k )\u2022 . Finally,\n\u03c6\u2022k U (S k )\u2022 \u2286 V (S k )\u2022 and U (S k )\u2022 \u2229 X(S k )\u2022 = (\u03c6\u2022k )\u22121 V (S k )\u2022 \u2229 X(S k )\u2022 are immediate to\ncheck, they boil down to \u03c6(U ) \u2286 V and U \u2229 X = \u03c6\u22121 (V ) \u2229 X respectively.\n\u0003\nIt is not hard to imagine that, modulo notational complications, the idea used to treat \u03c00 has\na higher-dimensional analogue. The underlying phenomenon is that homotopical considerations\nfor open subsets of Fr\u00e9chet spaces can be carried out in a piecewise-affine fashion over a dense\nsubspace. Bost's elegant approach of upgrading \u03c00 knowledge to higher homotopy groups is,\nhowever, more economical.\nAs we shall see, the above Lemma immediately yields the Relative Density Theorem in\nspectral K-theory (Proposition 7.9) and a positive answer to Swan's problem for the higher\nconnected stable ranks (Proposition 6.15). We also get a quick proof for the Relative Density\nTheorem in the Banach algebra case:\nCorollary 5.2. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a dense and completely relatively spectral morphism between\nBanach algebras. Then \u03c6 induces an isomorphism K\u2217 (A) \u2243 K\u2217 (B).\nProof. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a dense morphism that is spectral relative to a dense subalgebra X \u2286 A,\nthat is, A\u00d7 \u2229 X = \u03c6\u22121 (B \u00d7 ) \u2229 X. Lemma 5.1 says that \u03c6 induces a bijection \u03c0\u2217 (A\u00d7 ) \u2192 \u03c0\u2217 (B \u00d7 )\nfor \u2217 = 0, 1. Thus, if \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is a dense and completely relatively spectral morphism\nthen \u03c6 induces a bijection \u03c0\u2217 (GLn (A)) \u2192 \u03c0\u2217 (GLn (B)). It follows that \u03c6 induces a bijection\nlim \u03c0\u2217 (GLn (A)) \u2192 lim \u03c0\u2217 (GLn (B)). That is, \u03c6 induces an isomorphism K\u2217+1 (A) \u2243 K\u2217+1 (B).\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nAs the Bott isomorphism K0 (A) \u2243 K2 (A) is natural, we conclude that \u03c6 induces an isomorphism\nK\u2217 (A) \u2243 K\u2217 (B).\n\u0003\n\n\fRELATIVELY SPECTRAL MORPHISMS AND APPLICATIONS TO K-THEORY\n\n9\n\n6. Higher connected stable ranks\nThis section is devoted to higher analogues of the notion of connected stable rank. We start by\ndefining the higher connected stable ranks, and by estimating them in terms of the topological\nstable rank. We compute the higher connected stable ranks of C(\u03a3) for certain finite CWcomplexes \u03a3. Then we explain the relation between the higher connected stable ranks and\ncertain homotopy stabilization ranks. In particular, we obtain information about stabilization\nin K-theory. Finally, we give a positive answer to Swan's problem for the higher connected\nstable ranks.\n6.1. Defining and estimating higher connected stable ranks. Stable ranks for a topological algebra A are usually defined in terms of the sequence of left-generating sets\nLgn (A) = {(a1 , . . . , an ) : Aa1 + * * * + Aan = A} \u2286 An\nwhere n \u2265 1. It is easy to see that, for a good topological algebra A, Lgn (A) is open in An .\nRecall:\nDefinition 6.1. Let A be a good topological algebra.\nThe topological stable rank tsr(A) is the least n such that Lgn (A) is dense in An .\nThe connected stable rank csr(A) is the least n such that Lgm (A) is connected for all m \u2265 n.\nThe Bass stable rank bsr(A) is the least n such that Lgn+1 (A) is reducible to Lgn (A) in the\nfollowing sense: if (a1 , . . . , an+1 ) \u2208 Lgn+1 (A) then (a1 + x1 an+1 , . . . , an + xn an+1 ) \u2208 Lgn (A) for\nsome x1 , . . . , xn in A.\nRemark 6.2. The Bass stable rank, a purely algebraic notion, is due to Bass [3]. The topological\nstable rank and the connected stable rank were introduced by Rieffel [23]; implicitly, these two\nstable ranks also appear in [8]. Both [23] and [8] address the basic inequality csr \u2212 1 \u2264 bsr \u2264 tsr.\nNote that the definition of the connected stable rank that we adopt in this paper is not the\noriginal definition [23, Def.4.7] but rather an equivalent one [23, Cor.8.5]. Note also that the\nstable ranks defined above are, strictly speaking, left stable ranks. As usual, a stable rank is\ndeclared to be infinite if there is no integer fulfilling the requirement.\nWe define higher connected stable ranks, that is, stable ranks encoding the higher connectivity\nof the left-generating sets. As we shall see in the next subsection, such higher connectivity\nproperties are relevant for stabilization phenomena in K-theory.\nDefinition 6.3. Let A be a good topological algebra and k \u2265 0. The k-connected stable rank\ncsrk (A) is the least n such that Lgm (A) is k-connected for all m \u2265 n.\nRecall, a space \u03a3 is said to be k-connected if \u03c0i (\u03a3, \u2022) = 0 for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k (this is independent\nof the choice of basepoint \u2022 in \u03a3). Equivalently, \u03a3 is k-connected if each map S i \u2192 \u03a3 can be\nextended to a map I i+1 \u2192 \u03a3, for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k. Henceforth, I denotes the unit interval.\nThis definition yields a hierarchy of connected stable ranks\ncsr0 \u2264 csr1 \u2264 csr2 \u2264 . . .\nin which the very first one is the usual connected stable rank; indeed, topological algebras being\nlocally path-connected, connectivity and path-connectivity are equivalent for open subsets. We\nnow seek to generalize the following two important facts concerning the connected stable rank:\ni) csr is homotopy invariant, i.e., csr(A) = csr(B) whenever A and B are homotopy equivalent;\nii) csr \u2264 tsr + 1\nFact i) this is due to Nistor [21]. Recall that two morphisms \u03c60 , \u03c61 : A \u2192 B are said to be\nhomotopic if they are the endpoints of a path of morphisms {\u03c6t }0\u2264t\u22641 : A \u2192 B; here t 7\u2192 \u03c6t\nis continuous in the sense that t 7\u2192 \u03c6t (a) is continuous for each a \u2208 A. If there are morphisms\n\n\f10\n\nBOGDAN NICA\n\n\u03b1 : A \u2192 B and \u03b2 : B \u2192 A with \u03b2\u03b1 homotopic to idA and \u03b1\u03b2 homotopic to idB , then A and B\nare said to be homotopy equivalent.\nFact ii) can be obtained, for instance, by combining csr(A) \u2264 tsr(A(I)) (a fact implicit in\n[21]) with tsr(A(I)) \u2264 tsr(A) + 1 ([23, Cor.7.2]). We follow this strategy in the next proposition.\nRecall that we use X(Y ) to denote the continuous maps from Y to X.\nProposition 6.4. For each k \u2265 0 we have:\ni) csrk is homotopy invariant.\nii) csrk (A) \u2264 tsr(A(I k+1 )). In particular, csrk (A) \u2264 tsr(A) + k + 1. If Rieffel's estimate\ntsr(A(I 2 )) \u2264 tsr(A) + 1\n\u00041 \u0005\nholds, then in fact csrk (A) \u2264 tsr(A) + 2 k + 1.\n(R)\n\nProof. i) Homotopic morphisms \u03c60 , \u03c61 : A \u2192 B induce homotopic maps \u03c60 , \u03c61 : Lgm (A) \u2192\nLgm (B). Thus, if A and B are homotopy equivalent (as algebras), then Lgm (A) and Lgm (B)\nare homotopy equivalent (as topological spaces).\nii) We show the slightly better estimate csrk (A) \u2264 bsr(A(I k+1 )). To that end we use the\nfollowing fact [3, Lem.4.1]: if A \u2192 B is onto and m \u2265 bsr(A) then Lgm (A) \u2192 Lgm (B) is onto.\nIt follows, in particular, that bsr(B) \u2264 bsr(A) whenever B is a quotient of A.\nLet m \u2265 bsr(A(I k+1 )). We need to show that Lgm (A) is k-connected. We fix 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k and\nwe show that every map S i \u2192 Lgm (A) extends to a map I i+1 \u2192 Lgm (A).\nConsider the restriction morphism A(I i+1 ) \u0589 A(S i ). We have m \u2265 bsr(A(I i+1 )), as A(I i+1 )\nis a quotient of A(I k+1 ), so the restriction map Lgm (A(I i+1 )) \u2192 Lgm (A(S i )) is onto. For a\ncompact space \u03a3 - more generally, for paracompact \u03a3 [2, Lem.3.2] - one has a natural identification Lgm (A(\u03a3)) \u2243 (Lgm (A))(\u03a3). We thus have an onto map (Lgm (A))(I i+1 ) \u2192 (Lgm (A))(S i ),\nproving the desired extension property.\nFrom tsr(A(I)) \u2264 tsr(A)+1 one obtains tsr(A(I k+1 )) \u2264 tsr(A)+k+1, hence the\n\u0004 first\n\u0005 estimate\non csrk in terms of tsr. If (R) holds, then one obtains tsr(A(I k+1 )) \u2264 tsr(A) + 12 k + 1, hence\nthe second estimate on csrk .\n\u0003\nRemark 6.5. The estimate (R) appears as Question\n1.8\u0005 in [23]. The motivation comes from\n\u0004\nthe commutative case, as one has tsr(C(\u03a3)) = 21 dim(\u03a3) + 1 whenever \u03a3 is a compact space.\nSudo claims in [26] a proof for (R); however, Proposition 1 of [26] cannot hold. For if it is true,\nthen it implies (\u2020) tsr(A(I)) = max{csr(A), tsr(A)} for all C\u2217 -algebras A, by using Nistor's\ndescription for tsr(A(I)) as the absolute connected stable rank of A. Putting A = C(I k ) in\n(\u2020) leads to tsr(C(I k+1 )) = tsr(C(I k )) for all k \u2265 1, since csr(C(I k )) = 1 by the homotopy\ninvariance of the connected stable rank. This is a contradiction. The reader might enjoy finding\nelementary counterexamples to [26, Prop.1].\n6.2. Higher connected stable ranks for C(\u03a3). From Proposition 6.4 we obtain a dimensional\nupper bound for the higher connected stable ranks:\n\u0017\n\u0016\n1\nk+1\n(dim(\u03a3) + k + 1) + 1\ncsrk (C(\u03a3)) \u2264 tsr(C(\u03a3 \u00d7 I\n)) =\n2\nThat is:\n\u0018\n\u0019\ndim(\u03a3) + k\n(1)\ncsrk (C(\u03a3)) \u2264\n+1\n2\nIn general, we cannot have equality in (1), for the left-hand side is homotopy invariant whereas\nthe right-hand side is not. We will see, however, that in many natural cases we do get equality\nin (1).\n\u0006 \u0007\nLet us show, for a start, that csrk (C) = 21 k + 1. As Lgm (C) = Cm \\ {0} has the homotopy\ntype of S 2m\u22121 , which is (2m \u2212 2)-connected but not (2m \u2212 1)-connected, we obtain that csrk (C)\n\n\fRELATIVELY SPECTRAL MORPHISMS AND APPLICATIONS TO K-THEORY\n\n11\n\n\u0006 \u0007\n\u0006 \u0007\nis the least n such that 2n\u22122 \u2265 k, i.e., csrk (C) = 21 k +1. It follows that csrk (C(\u03a3)) = 21 k +1\nfor \u03a3 contractible.\nThe computation of csrk (C(\u03a3)) is a question about the vanishing of certain cohomotopy\ngroups associated to \u03a3. Indeed, if we identify Lgm (C(\u03a3)) with (Cm \\ {0})(\u03a3), then for i \u2265 0 we\nhave:\n[S i , Lgm (C(\u03a3))] = [S i , (Cm \\ {0})(\u03a3)] = [\u03a3 \u00d7 S i , Cm \\ {0}] = [\u03a3 \u00d7 S i , S 2m\u22121 ]\nThus csrk (C(\u03a3)) is the least n such that, for all m \u2265 n, we have [\u03a3 \u00d7 S i , S 2m\u22121 ] = 0 for\n0 \u2264 i \u2264 k. This explicit formulation shows, once again, that the higher connected stable ranks\nof C(\u03a3) only depend on the homotopy type of \u03a3. We can also recover (1). Indeed, if \u03a3\u2032 is a\nfinite CW-complex then [\u03a3\u2032 , S N ] = 0 as soon as N > dim(\u03a3\u2032 ). Thus,\u0006 if dim(\u03a3) + k \u0007< 2m \u2212 1\nthen [\u03a3 \u00d7 S i , S 2m\u22121 ] = 0 for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k. We obtain csrk (C(\u03a3)) \u2264 21 (dim(\u03a3) + k) + 1, i.e.,\n(1).\nNow, for suitable dimensions, non-trivial cohomology implies non-trivial cohomotopy:\nLemma 6.6. Let \u03a3\u2032 be an N -dimensional finite CW-complex. Then:\na) H N (\u03a3\u2032 ; Z) 6= 0 if and only if [\u03a3\u2032 , S N ] 6= 0;\nb) H N \u22121 (\u03a3\u2032 ; Z) 6= 0 implies [\u03a3\u2032 , S N \u22121 ] 6= 0.\nNote that part b) is not an equivalence, as witnessed by \u03a3\u2032 = S N for N \u2265 3. The previous\nlemma also holds for \u03a3\u2032 an N -dimensional compact metric space, by results from Hurewicz &\nWallman: Dimension Theory, pp. 149-150. The cohomology is then understood in the \u010cech\nsense.\nProof. Recall that H N (\u03a3\u2032 ; Z) can be identified with [\u03a3\u2032 , K(Z, N )]. Realize the K(Z, N ) CWcomplex by starting with S N as its N -skeleton and then adding cells of dimension \u2265 N + 2 that\nkill the higher homotopy.\nFor a) we claim that the natural map [\u03a3\u2032 , S N ] \u2192 [\u03a3\u2032 , K(Z, N )] is bijective. Surjectivity is\nclearly a consequence of the Cellular Approximation Theorem. But so is injectivity: a homotopy\nin K(Z, N ) between f0 , f1 : \u03a3\u2032 \u2192 S N can be assumed cellular, so it maps to the (N + 1)-skeleton\nof K(Z, N ) which is S N . That is, the maps f0 , f1 : \u03a3\u2032 \u2192 S N are actually homotopic over S N .\nFor b), note that [\u03a3\u2032 , S N ] \u2192 [\u03a3\u2032 , K(Z, N )] remains surjective if \u03a3\u2032 is (N + 1)-dimensional.\nAgain, this follows from the Cellular Approximation Theorem and the fact that the (N + 1)skeleton of K(Z, N ) is S N . Replacing N by N \u2212 1 gives b) as stated.\n\u0003\nWe obtain the following sufficient condition for having equality in (1):\nProposition 6.7. Let \u03a3 be a d-dimensional finite CW-complex.\n\u0007\n\u0006\na) Let k \u2265 1. If H d (\u03a3; Z) 6= 0 then csrk (C(\u03a3)) = 21 (d + k) + 1.\nd\nd\u22121\n(\u03a3; Z) 6= 0 for even d, then csr(C(\u03a3)) =\n\u0006 1 b)\u0007 Let k = 0. If H (\u03a3; Z) 6= 0 for odd d, or H\nd\n+\n1.\n2\n\u0006\n\u0007\nProof. a) Let m = 21 (d + k) . Then dim(\u03a3 \u00d7 S i ) = 2m \u2212 1 for some 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k, namely\ni\nd\ni\ni\ni = k \u2212 1 or i = k. Now H 2m\u22121 (\u03a3 \u00d7 S\n\u0006 1; Z) \u2243 \u0007H (\u03a3; Z) \u2297Z H (S ; Z) is non-vanishing, so\ni\n2m\u22121\n[\u03a3 \u00d7 S , S\n] \u00066= 0.\u0007 Thus csrk (C(\u03a3)) > 2 (d + k) .\nb) Let m = 21 d . If\u0006d is\u0007 odd, then 2m \u2212 1 = d so H d (\u03a3; Z) 6= 0 implies [\u03a3, S 2m\u22121 ] 6= 0.\nTherefore csr(C(\u03a3)) > 12 d . If d is even, then 2m \u2212 1 = d\u0006 \u2212 \u00071. Here we use the fact that\nH d\u22121 (\u03a3; Z) 6= 0 implies [\u03a3, S 2m\u22121 ] 6= 0. We get csr(C(\u03a3)) > 12 d in this case as well.\n\u0003\n\u0007\n\u0006\nExample 6.8. We have csrk (C(T d )) = 21 (d + k) + 1 for the d-torus.\n\u0006\n\u0007\nExample 6.9. For the d-sphere, Proposition 6.7 gives csrk (C(S d )) = 21 (d + k) + 1 for k \u2265 1,\nand for k = 0 and odd d. If k = 0 and d is even, the cohomological criterion fails us. Nevertheless,\n\n\f12\n\nBOGDAN NICA\n\n\u0007\n\u0006\nwe have [S d , S d\u22121 ] 6= 0 for d 6= 2, hence\ncsr\u0007k (C(S d )) = 12 (d + k) + 1 in this case, too.\n\u0006\nSummarizing, we have csrk (C(S d )) = 12 (d + k) + 1 except for k = 0, d = 2. We leave it to the\nreader to verify that csr(C(S 2 )) = 1.\n6.3. Stabilization in K-theory and higher connected stable ranks. As before, let A be\na good topological algebra. The sequence\n{1} = GL0 (A) \u0592\u2192 A\u00d7 = GL1 (A) \u0592\u2192 GL2 (A) \u0592\u2192 . . .\ninduces, for each i \u2265 0, a sequence of (identity-based) homotopy groups:\n(\u03c0i )\n\n\u03c0i (GL0 (A)) \u2192 \u03c0i (GL1 (A)) \u2192 \u03c0i (GL2 (A)) \u2192 . . .\n\nSay that m is a stable level for (\u03c0i ) if \u03c0i (GLm\u2032 (A)) \u2192 \u03c0i (GLm\u2032 +1 (A)) is an isomorphism for all\nm\u2032 \u2265 m. In analogy with k-connectivity, which requires vanishing of all homotopy groups up to\nthe k-th one, the following notion encodes the stabilization of (\u03c0i ) for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k:\nDefinition 6.10. Let k \u2265 0. The k-homotopy stabilization rank hsrk (A) is the least nonnegative\ninteger which is a stable level for (\u03c0i ), for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k.\nHomotopy stabilization ranks are closely related to higher connected stable ranks:\nProposition 6.11. hsrk (A) \u2264 csrk+1 (A) \u2212 1 and csrk (A) \u2212 1 \u2264 max{hsrk (A), csr(A) \u2212 1}.\nRoughly speaking, we have csrk (A) \u2212 1 \u2264 hsrk (A) \u2264 csrk+1 (A) \u2212 1. This actually holds if,\nsay, tsr(A) = 1 and K1 (A) 6= 0, for then hsr0 (A) \u2265 1 \u2265 csr(A) \u2212 1.\nProof. Let m \u2265 csr(A) \u2212 1. According to [9, Cor.1.6] one has a long exact homotopy sequence:\n* * * \u2192 \u03c0i+1 (Lgm+1 (A)) \u2192 \u03c0i (GLm (A)) \u2192 \u03c0i (GLm+1 (A)) \u2192 \u03c0i (Lgm+1 (A)) \u2192 * * *\n* * * \u2192 \u03c01 (Lgm+1 (A)) \u2192 \u03c00 (GLm (A)) \u2192 \u03c00 (GLm+1 (A)) \u2192 0\nLet m \u2265 csrk+1 (A) \u2212 1. Then \u03c0i (GLm (A)) \u2192 \u03c0i (GLm+1 (A)) is an isomorphism for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k.\nHence csrk+1 (A) \u2212 1 is a stable level for (\u03c0i ), for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k, so hsrk (A) \u2264 csrk+1 (A) \u2212 1.\nFor the second inequality, let m \u2265 max{hsrk (A), csr(A) \u2212 1}. Then Lgm+1 (A) is connected\nand, for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, \u03c0i (Lgm+1 (A)) is trivial since it is squeezed between two isomorphisms in\nthe above exact sequence. Thus Lgm+1 (A) is k-connected.\n\u0003\nCorollary 6.12. Let \u03a3 be a finite CW-complex of dimension 2d whose top cohomology group is\nnon-zero. Then hsr1 (C(\u03a3)) = d + 1, i.e., the level at which both (\u03c00 ) and (\u03c01 ) begin to stabilize\nis d + 1.\n\u0006 \u0007\nCorollary 6.13. hsrk (A) \u2264 tsr(A) + k + 1; if (R) holds, then hsrk (A) \u2264 tsr(A) + 21 k .\n\nRemark 6.14. The estimate hsrk (A) \u2264 tsr(A)+k+1 is essentially Theorem 6.3 of [9]. However,\nsuch an estimate is not our main goal. The purpose of the above discussion is rather to emphasize\nthe following ideas:\ni) the stable ranks that are best suited for controlling stabilization in the homotopy sequences\n(\u03c0\u2217 ) are the connected stable ranks;\nii) the connected stable ranks can be estimated by the \"dimensional\" stable ranks, namely\nthe topological stable rank and the Bass stable rank, which are typically easier to compute;\niii) Rieffel's conjectured inequality (R) plays a crucial role in providing good estimates for\nthe connected stable ranks, hence in estimating homotopy stabilization.\nFor Banach algebras, the K-theoretic interpretation is the following. The K1 group and the\nK0 group are the limit groups of the direct sequences (\u03c00 ) and (\u03c01 ):\nK1 (A) = lim \u03c00 (GLn (A)),\n\u2212\u2192\n\nK0 (A) \u2243 lim \u03c01 (GLn (A))\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\fRELATIVELY SPECTRAL MORPHISMS AND APPLICATIONS TO K-THEORY\n\n13\n\nLet us stress the following aspect: stabilization for (\u03c00 ) is indeed stabilization for K1 , whereas\nstabilization for (\u03c01 ) is construed as stabilization for K0 .\nTherefore:\n* K1 (A) \u2243 \u03c00 (GLn (A)) for n \u2265 csr1 (A) \u2212 1;\n* K1 (A) \u2243 \u03c00 (GLn (A)) and K0 (A) \u2243 \u03c01 (GLn (A)) for n \u2265 csr2 (A) \u2212 1.\nIn particular, relative to the topological stable rank we have\n* K1 (A) \u2243 \u03c00 (GLn (A)) for n \u2265 tsr(A) + 1 (compare [23, Thm.10.12]);\n* K1 (A) \u2243 \u03c00 (GLn (A)) and K0 (A) \u2243 \u03c01 (GLn (A)) for n \u2265 tsr(A) + 2.\nIf, furthermore, (R) holds, then\n* K1 (A) \u2243 \u03c00 (GLn (A)) for n \u2265 tsr(A);\n* K1 (A) \u2243 \u03c00 (GLn (A)) and K0 (A) \u2243 \u03c01 (GLn (A)) for n \u2265 tsr(A) + 1.\n6.4. Swan's problem for the higher connected stable ranks. Recall that Swan's problem\nasks the following: if \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is a dense and spectral morphism, are the stable ranks of\nA and B equal? We show that this is indeed the case for the higher connected stable ranks.\nThe next result improves a result of Badea [2, Thm.4.15] in several ways. First and foremost,\nit removes the commutativity assumption. Second, it suffices to know that the morphism is\nrelatively spectral. Third, it handles the whole hierarchy of connected stable ranks.\nProposition 6.15. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a dense and relatively spectral morphism, where A and\nB are good Fr\u00e9chet algebras. Then csrk (A) = csrk (B) for all k \u2265 0.\nProof. We have \u03c6(Lgm (A)) \u2286 Lgm (B). We claim that Lgm (A) \u2229 X m = \u03c6\u22121 (Lgm (B)) \u2229 X m ,\nwhere X is a dense subalgebra\nof A relative to which \u03c6 is spectral. Let (xi ) \u2208 X m with\nP\nm\n(\u03c6(xi )) \u2208 Lgm (B), so\nci \u03c6(xi ) = 1 for some (ci ) \u2208 BP\n. Density of \u03c6 allows\nP \u2032 to\u0001approximate\neach ci by some \u03c6(x\u2032i ), where x\u2032i \u2208 X, so as to get\n\u03c6(x\u2032i )\u03c6(xi ) = \u03c6\nxi xi \u2208 B \u00d7 . As\nP \u2032\nP \u2032\n\u00d7\nxi xi \u2208 X, we infer that\nxi xi \u2208 A by relative spectrality. Thus (xi ) \u2208 Lgm (A) as desired.\nLemma 5.1 applied to the dense morphism \u03c6 : Am \u2192 B m gives that \u03c6 induces a weak\nhomotopy equivalence between Lgm (A) and Lgm (B). In particular, Lgm (A) is k-connected if\nand only if Lgm (B) is k-connected.\n\u0003\n\u0007\n\u0006\n6.8. \u0007Since the dense\nExample 6.16.

Spectral K-functors\nBy a K-functor we simply mean a functor from good Fr\u00e9chet algebras to abelian groups.\nThe notion of K-scheme we introduce below provides a general framework for constructing\nK-functors. A K-functor is usually required to be stable, homotopy-invariant, half-exact and\ncontinuous. These properties do not concern us here. We point out, however, that the functors\ninduced by K-schemes are stable and homotopy-invariant by construction.\nRoughly speaking, a K-scheme is a selection of elements in each good Fr\u00e9chet algebra in such\na way that morphisms and amplifications preserve the selection. An open set \u03a9 \u2286 C containing\nthe origin selects, in every good Fr\u00e9chet algebra, those elements whose spectrum is contained\nin \u03a9. We can thus associate to each \u03a9 a K-functor K\u03a9 ; these K-functors are called spectral\nK-functors. For suitable choices of \u03a9, one recovers the K0 and K1 functors. We investigate\nhow K\u03a9 depends on \u03a9 and we show, for instance, that conformally equivalent domains yield\nnaturally equivalent spectral K-functors. Finally, we prove the Relative Density Theorem for\nspectral K-functors.\n\n\f14\n\nBOGDAN NICA\n\n7.1. K-schemes and induced K-functors.

Observe, at this point, that the set of S-elements in a good\nFr\u00e9chet algebra is invariant under conjugation.\nA K-scheme S gives rise to a K-functor KS . We first construct a functor VS with values in\nabelian monoids, then we obtain a functor with values in abelian groups via the Grothendieck\nfunctor.\nLet A be a good Fr\u00e9chet algebra. The embeddings Mn (A) \u0592\u2192 Mn+1 (A), given by a 7\u2192\ndiag(a, 0), restrict to embeddings Mn (A)S \u0592\u2192 Mn+1 (A)S .

In other words, VS (A) = lim \u03c00 Mn (A)S as a set. The conjugacy-invariance of\n\u2212\u2192\nS-elements gives that VS (A) is an abelian monoid under [a] + [b] := [diag(a, b)].\nLet \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a morphism. We then have a monoid morphism VS (\u03c6) : VS (A) \u2192 VS (B)\ngiven by VS (\u03c6)([a]) = [\u03c6(a)]. Here we use \u03c6 to denote each of the amplified morphisms Mn (A) \u2192\nMn (B).\nSo far, we have that VS is a monoid-valued functor on good Fr\u00e9chet algebras. Let KS be\nobtained by applying the Grothendieck functor to VS . We conclude:\nProposition 7.1. KS is a K-functor.\nThe K-functor associated to a K-scheme is modeled after the K0 functor, which arises in\nthis way from the idempotent K-scheme A 7\u2192 Idem(A). One could introduce a \"multiplicative\"\nversion of K-scheme, where the axiom 0 \u2208 AS is replaced by 1 \u2208 AS , and suitably define a corresponding K-functor so that one recovers the K1 functor from the invertible K-scheme A 7\u2192 A\u00d7 .\nHowever, the difference between the \"additive\" axiom 0 \u2208 AS and the \"multiplicative\" axiom\n1 \u2208 AS is a unit shift, which makes such a \"multiplicative\" K-scheme essentially redundant.\nTherefore, up to the natural equivalence induced by the unit shift, we may think of the K1\nfunctor as arising form the shifted invertible K-scheme A 7\u2192 A\u00d7 \u2212 1.\nA morphism of K-schemes f : S \u2192 S \u2032 associates to each good Fr\u00e9chet algebra A a continuous\nmap f : AS \u2192 AS \u2032 such that the following axioms are satisfied:\n(M S1 ) f (0) = 0\n(M S2 ) if a \u2208 Mp (A)S and b \u2208 Mq (A)S then diag(f (a), f (b)) = f (diag(a, b)) in Mp+q (A)S \u2032\n(M S3 ) if \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is a morphism then the following diagram commutes:\n\u03c6\n\nAS \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nfy\n\u03c6\n\nBS\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nfy\n\nAS \u2032 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 BS \u2032\nProposition 7.2. A morphism of K-schemes f : S \u2192 S \u2032 induces a natural transformation of\nK-functors Kf : KS \u2192 KS \u2032 .\nProof. If suffices to show that f : S \u2192 S \u2032 induces a natural transformation Vf : VS \u2192 VS \u2032 . First,\nwe show that for any good Fr\u00e9chet algebra A there is a monoid morphism fA : VS (A) \u2192 VS \u2032 (A).\n\n\fRELATIVELY SPECTRAL MORPHISMS AND APPLICATIONS TO K-THEORY\n\n15\n\nSecond, we show that for any morphism \u03c6 : A \u2192 B the following diagram commutes:\nVS (\u03c6)\n\nVS (A) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 VS (B)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nfA y\nfB y\nV\n\n\u2032 (\u03c6)\n\nVS \u2032 (A) \u2212\u2212S\u2212\u2212\u2192 VS \u2032 (B)\nLet A be a good Fr\u00e9chet algebra. Define fA : VS (A) \u2192 VS \u2032 (A) by fA ([a]) = [f (a)]. Note that\nfA is well-defined: if a \u2208 Mp (A)S and b \u2208 Mq (A)S are eventually homotopic, i.e., diag(a, 0n\u2212p )\nand diag(b, 0n\u2212q ) are path-homotopic in some Mn (A)S , then\nf (diag(a, 0n\u2212p )) = diag(f (a), 0n\u2212p )\nand\nf (diag(b, 0n\u2212q )) = diag(f (b), 0n\u2212q )\nare path-homotopic in Mn (A)S \u2032 , i.e., f (a) \u2208 Mp (A)S \u2032 and f (b) \u2208 Mq (A)S \u2032 are eventually\nhomotopic. Clearly fA is a monoid morphism: we have fA ([0]) = [f (0)] = [0] by (M S1 ), while\nby (M S2 ) we have\nfA ([a] + [b]) = fA [diag(a, b)] =\n\n[f (diag(a, b))]\n\n=\n\n[diag(f (a), f (b))] = [f (a)] + [f (b)] = fA ([a]) + fA ([b]).\n\nThe commutativity of the diagram follows from (M S3 ).\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0003\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nNote that, if f : S \u2192 S and g : S \u2192 S are morphisms of K-schemes then gf : S \u2192 S is a\nmorphism of K-schemes and Kgf = Kg Kf .\nThe morphisms of K-schemes f, g : S \u2192 S \u2032 are homotopic if f, g : AS \u2192 AS \u2032 are homotopic\nfor any good Fr\u00e9chet algebra A. If that is the case, then f and g induce the same natural\ntransformation Kf = Kg : KS \u2192 KS \u2032 . The K-schemes S, S \u2032 are homotopy equivalent if there\nare morphisms of K-schemes f : S \u2192 S \u2032 and g : S \u2032 \u2192 S such that gf is homotopic to idS and\nf g is homotopic to idS \u2032 . A K-scheme S is contractible if S is homotopy equivalent to the zero\nK-scheme A 7\u2192 {0A }.\nProposition 7.3. If the K-schemes S and S \u2032 are homotopy equivalent, then the K-functors KS\nand KS \u2032 are naturally equivalent. In particular, if the K-scheme S is contractible then KS is\nthe zero functor.\n7.2. Spectral K-functors: defining K\u03a9 . Let 0 \u2208 \u03a9 \u2286 C be an open set. The spectral Kscheme S\u03a9 associates to each good Fr\u00e9chet algebra A the subset A\u03a9 = {a : sp(a) \u2286 \u03a9}. The\naxioms are easy to check; for instance, (S2 ) follows from\n\u0001\nspMp+q (A) diag(a, b) = spMp (A) (a) \u222a spMq (A) (b)\n\nwhile (S3 ) follows from the fact that morphisms are non-increasing on spectra.\nThe K-functor associated to the spectral K-scheme S\u03a9 is denoted by K\u03a9 and is referred to\nas a spectral K-functor.\n\nExample 7.4. We compute K\u03a9 (C).\nAssume, for simplicity, that \u03a9 has finitely many connected components \u03a90 , \u03a91 , . . . , \u03a9k , where\n\u03a90 is the component of 0. For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, let #i (a) denote the number of eigenvalues, counted\nwith multiplicity, of a \u2208 Mn (C) that lie in \u03a9i . Then the eigenvalue-counting map # : V\u03a9 (C) \u2192\nNk given by #([a]) = (#1 (a), . . . , #k (a)) is well-defined. Visibly, # is a surjective morphism of\nmonoids. We show # is injective. For 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, pick a basepoint \u03bbi \u2208 \u03a9i and think of\n\u0001\n\u03bb(a) = diag \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbk , . . . , \u03bbk\n| {z }\n| {z }\n#1 (a)\n\n#k (a)\n\n\f16\n\nBOGDAN NICA\n\nas a normal form for a \u2208 Mn (C). It suffices to show that a is eventually homotopic to \u03bb(a).\nSimilar matrices are eventually homotopic; this is true for any K-scheme in fact. Thus a is\neventually homotopic to its Jordan normal form. Up to a spectrum-preserving homotopy, one\ncan assume that the Jordan normal form is in fact diagonal. Finally, a homotopy sends all\neigenvalues in each \u03a9i to the chosen basepoint \u03bbi , and all eigenvalues in \u03a90 to 0. That is, we\ncan reach a diagonal matrix diag(\u03bb(a), 0, . . . , 0).\nTherefore V\u03a9 (C) is isomorphic to Nk and, consequently, K\u03a9 (C) is isomorphic to Zk .\n7.3. Spectral K-functors: dependence on \u03a9. An open set \u03a9 \u2286 C containing 0 is thought\nof as a based open set. Correspondingly, a holomorphic map f : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9\u2032 sending 0 to 0 is called\na based holomorphic map.\nProposition 7.5. A based holomorphic map f : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9\u2032 induces a morphism of K-schemes\nf\u2217 : S\u03a9 \u2192 S\u03a9\u2032 , hence a natural transformation of K-functors Kf\u2217 : K\u03a9 \u2192 K\u03a9\u2032 . In particular,\na based conformal equivalence between \u03a9 and \u03a9\u2032 induces a natural equivalence between K\u03a9 and\nK\u03a9\u2032 .\nProof. Let A be a good Fr\u00e9chet algebra. We have a map f\u2217 : A\u03a9 \u2192 A\u03a9\u2032 given by f\u2217 (a) :=\nf (a) = Oa (f ), where Oa : O(\u03a9) \u2192 A is the holomorphic calculus of a \u2208 A\u03a9 . We claim that f\u2217\nis continuous. Indeed, let an \u2192 a in A\u03a9 . Pick a (topologically tame) cycle \u03b3 containing sp(a) in\nits interior. Since the set of elements whose spectrum is contained in the interior of \u03b3 is open,\nwe may assume without loss of generality that all the an 's have their spectrum contained in the\ninterior of \u03b3. Then\nI\n\u0001\n1\nf (\u03bb) (\u03bb \u2212 an )\u22121 \u2212 (\u03bb \u2212 a)\u22121 d\u03bb\nf\u2217 (an ) \u2212 f\u2217 (a) =\n2\u03c0i \u03b3\nand so f\u2217 (an ) \u2192 f\u2217 (a) since the integrand converges to 0. We show f\u2217 is a morphism of\nK-schemes. Axiom (M S1 ) is obvious. For (M S2 ) we use the uniqueness of holomorphic\ncalculus. If Oa : O(\u03a9) \u2192 Mp (A) is the holomorphic calculus for a and Ob : O(\u03a9) \u2192\nMq (A) is the holomorphic calculus for b, then diag(Oa , Ob ) : O(\u03a9) \u2192 Mp+q (A) given by\ng 7\u2192 diag(Oa (g), Ob (g)) is a holomorphic calculus for diag(a, b); thus Odiag(a,b) = diag(Oa , Ob ),\nin particular f\u2217 (diag(a, b)) = diag(f\u2217 (a), f\u2217 (b)). For (M S3 ), we use again the uniqueness\nof holomorphic calculus. If Oa : O(\u03a9) \u2192 A is the holomorphic calculus of a \u2208 A\u03a9 then\n\u03c6 \u25e6 Oa : O(\u03a9) \u2192 B is a holomorphic calculus for \u03c6(a) hence \u03c6 \u25e6 Oa = O\u03c6(a) , in particular\n\u03c6(f\u2217 (a)) = f\u2217 (\u03c6(a)) for all a \u2208 A\u03a9 .\nFor the second part, if suffices to check that (gf )\u2217 = g\u2217 f\u2217 for based holomorphic maps\nf : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9\u2032 and g : \u03a9\u2032 \u2192 \u03a9\u2032\u2032 . That is, we need (gf )(a) = g(f (a)) for all a \u2208 A\u03a9 . This follows\u0001\nonce again by the uniqueness of holomorphic calculus: as both h 7\u2192 (hf\u0001)(a) and h 7\u2192 h f (a)\nare holomorphic calculi O(\u03a9\u2032 ) \u2192 A for f (a), we get (hf )(a) = h f (a) for all h \u2208 O(\u03a9\u2032 ), in\nparticular for g.\n\u0003\nCorollary 7.6. If \u03a9 is connected and simply connected then K\u03a9 is the zero functor.\nProof. By the conformal invariance of K\u03a9 and the Riemann Mapping Theorem, we may assume\nthat \u03a9 is either the entire complex plane, or the open unit disk. To show that K\u03a9 is the zero\nfunctor, it suffices to get \u03c00 (A\u03a9 ) = 0 for every good Fr\u00e9chet algebra A. Indeed, each a \u2208 A\u03a9\ncan be connected to 0A by the path t 7\u2192 ta, path which lies in A\u03a9 since t\u03a9 \u2286 \u03a9 for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1.\nIn a more sophisticated formulation, S\u03a9 is contractible.\n\u0003\nProposition 7.5 shows that the functor K\u03a9 depends only on the conformal type of \u03a9. But more\nis true, in fact: K\u03a9 depends only on the holomorphic homotopy type of \u03a9. Roughly speaking,\nthe notion of holomorphic homotopy type is obtained from the usual notion of homotopy type\nby requiring the maps to be holomorphic rather than continuous.\n\n\fRELATIVELY SPECTRAL MORPHISMS AND APPLICATIONS TO K-THEORY\n\n17\n\nThe based holomorphic maps f, g : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9\u2032 are holomorphically homotopic if there is a family\nof based holomorphic maps {ht }0\u2264t\u22641 : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9\u2032 such that h0 = f , h1 = g and t 7\u2192 ht \u2208 O(\u03a9)\nis continuous. If that is the case, then the induced morphisms of K-schemes f\u2217 , g\u2217 : S\u03a9 \u2192 S\u03a9\u2032\nare homotopic. If there are based holomorphic maps f : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9\u2032 and g : \u03a9\u2032 \u2192 \u03a9 such that f g\nis holomorphically homotopic to id\u03a9\u2032 and gf is holomorphically homotopic to id\u03a9 , then \u03a9 and\n\u03a9\u2032 are said to be holomorphic-homotopy equivalent. If that is the case, then the K-schemes S\u03a9\nand S\u03a9\u2032 are homotopy equivalent in the sense described in the previous subsection. Therefore:\nProposition 7.7. If \u03a9 and \u03a9\u2032 are holomorphic-homotopy equivalent, then K\u03a9 and K\u03a9\u2032 are\nnaturally equivalent.\n7.4. Spectral K-functors: recovering K0 and K1 . The K1 functor can be obtained from\nthe shifted invertible K-scheme A 7\u2192 A\u00d7 \u2212 1. That is, K1 is naturally equivalent to K\u03a9 for\n\u03a9 = C \\ {\u22121}. The K0 functor can be obtained from the idempotent K-scheme A 7\u2192 Idem(A).\nHowever, the idempotent scheme is not a spectral K-scheme. We now realize the K0 functor as\na spectral K-functor.\nProposition 7.8. K0 = K\u03a9 for \u03a9 = C \\ {Re = 21 }.\nProof. Let \u03c7 denote the function defined on \u03a9 as \u03c7 = 0 on {Re < 21 } and \u03c7 = 1 on {Re > 12 }.\nConsider the holomorphic functions {ht }0\u2264t\u22641 : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9 defined as ht = (1 \u2212 t)id + t\u03c7. We claim\nthat {(ht )\u2217 }0\u2264t\u22641 is a strong deformation of S\u03a9 to the idempotent K-scheme. It will then follow\nthat K\u03a9 = K0 .\nLet A be a good Fr\u00e9chet algebra. We need to show that {(ht )\u2217 }0\u2264t\u22641 is a strong deformation\nfrom A\u03a9 to the idempotents of A. Each (ht )\u2217 : A\u03a9 \u2192 A\u03a9 is continuous. The map t 7\u2192 ht is\nO(\u03a9)-continuous, so t 7\u2192 (ht )\u2217 is A-continuous. At t = 0, (h0 )\u2217 = idA\u03a9 . At t = 1, (h1 )\u2217 = \u03c7\u2217\ntakes idempotent values since \u03c72 = \u03c7. Finally, each (ht )\u2217 acts identically on idempotents.\nIndeed, it suffices to show that \u03c7\u2217 acts identically on idempotents.

It is this\nalternate picture for K0 that inspired us in defining the K\u03a9 groups. Note that K\u03a9 is naturally\nequivalent to K0 whenever \u03a9 is the disjoint union of two connected and simply connected open\nsubsets of C.\n7.5. Spectral K-functors: the Density Theorem. Finally, we prove the Relative Density\nTheorem for spectral K-functors. In particular, we obtain the Relative Density Theorem for the\nusual K-theory. In the case of K0 , this proof is more elementary than the proof of Corollary 5.2,\nwhich used the Bott periodicity.\nProposition 7.9. If \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is a dense and completely relatively spectral morphism between\ngood Fr\u00e9chet algebras, then \u03c6 induces an isomorphism K\u03a9 (A) \u2243 K\u03a9 (B).\nProof. Let \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a dense morphism that is spectral relative to a dense subalgebra\nX \u2286 A. Obviously A\u03a9 \u2229 X = \u03c6\u22121 (B\u03a9 ) \u2229 X, so \u03c6 induces a bijection \u03c00 (A\u03a9 ) \u2192 \u03c00 (B\u03a9 ) by\nLemma 5.1. Thus, if \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is a dense and completely relatively spectral morphism then\n\u03c6 induces a bijection \u03c00 (Mn (A)\u03a9 ) \u2192 \u03c00 (Mn (B)\u03a9 ) for each n \u2265 1. It follows that \u03c6 induces a\nbijection lim \u03c00 (Mn (A)\u03a9 ) \u2192 lim \u03c00 (Mn (B)\u03a9 ). In other words, V\u03a9 (\u03c6) : V\u03a9 (A) \u2192 V\u03a9 (B) is a\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nbijection.

Let A and B be Banach algebra completions of an algebra X. Say\nthat A and B are spectrally equivalent over X if spA (x) = spB (x) for all x \u2208 X, and completely\nspectrally equivalent over X if Mn (A) and Mn (B) are spectrally equivalent over Mn (X) for each\nn \u2265 1.\nProposition 8.1. The higher connected stable ranks and the property of being finite are invariant under spectral equivalence. Furthermore, K-theory and the property of being stably finite are\ninvariant under complete spectral equivalence.\nProof. Let A, B be Banach algebra completions of X. Let X be the Banach algebra obtained\nby completing X under the norm kxk := kxkA + kxkB . Then rX (x) = max{rA (x), rB (x)} for\nall x \u2208 X. Now, if A and B are spectrally equivalent over X then rX (x) = rA (x) = rB (x) for\nall x \u2208 X. We obtain dense and relatively spectral morphisms X \u2192 A, X \u2192 B by extending\nthe inclusions X \u0592\u2192 A, X \u0592\u2192 B. Thus csrk (A) = csrk (X) = csrk (B), and A is finite if and only\nif X is finite if and only if B is finite.\nIf A and B are completely spectrally equivalent over X then we obtain morphisms X \u2192 A,\nX \u2192 B that are completely spectral relative to X. Hence K\u2217 (A) \u2243 K\u2217 (X) \u2243 K\u2217 (B), and A is\nstably finite if and only if X is stably finite if and only if B is stably finite.\n\u0003\nTwo algebras that are spectrally equivalent need not be connected by a morphism.

The argument used in the proof of Lemma 3.3 shows the following: if\nA and B are spectrally equivalent over X, then there is a dense and relatively spectral morphism\nA \u2192 B extending the identity on X.\nA criterion for complete spectral equivalence is given in the next section.\n8.2.

A weight on a group \u0393 is a map S 7\u2192 \u03c9(S) \u2208 [1, \u221e) on the\nfinite nonempty subsets of \u0393 which is non-decreasing, i.e., S \u2286 S \u2032 implies \u03c9(S) \u2264 \u03c9(S \u2032 ). A\nweight \u03c9 is subexponential if \u03c9(S n )1/n \u2192 1 for all S.\nProposition 8.2. Let A\u0393 and B\u0393 be Banach algebra completions of a group algebra C\u0393. Assume\nthat there are constants C, C \u2032 > 0 and subexponential weights \u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032 such that\nkakB \u2264 C\u03c9(supp a)kakA ,\n\nkakA \u2264 C \u2032 \u03c9 \u2032 (supp a)kakB\n\nfor all a \u2208 C\u0393. Then A\u0393 and B\u0393 are completely spectrally equivalent over C\u0393.\nProof. Let k \u2265 1. For all (aij ) \u2208 Mk (C\u0393) we have analogous subexponential estimates in the\nmatrix algebras Mk (A\u0393) and Mk (B\u0393):\n\u0001\n\u0001\nk(aij )kB \u2264 C\u03c9 supp (aij ) k(aij )kA , k(aij )kA \u2264 C \u2032 \u03c9 \u2032 supp (aij ) k(aij )kB\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nAs \u03c9 supp (aij )n \u2264 \u03c9 (supp (aij ))n , we get rA (aij ) = rB (aij ) for all (aij ) \u2208 Mk (C\u0393). \u0003\n\nExample 8.3. Let \u0393 be a group of subexponential growth. We claim that l1 \u0393 \u0592\u2192 C\u2217r \u0393 is\ncompletely\np spectral relative to C\u0393. Indeed, let \u03c9 be the subexponential weight on \u0393 given by\n\u03c9(S) = vol B(S), where B(S) denotes the ball centered at the identity that circumscribes S.\nFor all a \u2208 C\u0393 we have kak \u2264 kak1 and kak1 \u2264 \u03c9(supp a)kak2 \u2264 \u03c9(supp a)kak, i.e., we are in\nthe conditions of Proposition 8.2. We infer that K\u2217 (l1 \u0393) \u2243 K\u2217 (C\u2217r \u0393).\nConsider, at this point, the following\nConjecture. For any discrete countable group \u0393, the inclusion l1 \u0393 \u0592\u2192 C\u2217r \u0393 induces an isomorphism K\u2217 (l1 \u0393) \u2243 K\u2217 (C\u2217r \u0393).\n\n\fRELATIVELY SPECTRAL MORPHISMS AND APPLICATIONS TO K-THEORY\n\n19\n\nLet us refer to this statement as the BBC conjecture, for it connects the Bost conjecture\nwith the Baum-Connes conjecture. We find the BBC conjecture to be a natural question on\nits own, outside of the Bost-Baum-Connes context. One knows, by combining results of Higson\nand Kasparov on the Baum-Connes side with results of Lafforgue on the Bost side, that the\nBBC conjecture holds for groups with the Haagerup property. On the other hand, the spectral\napproach allowed us to verify the BBC conjecture for groups of subexponential growth. The\nsevere limitations of the spectral approach are made evident by this comparison.\nExample 8.4. Let \u0393 be a finitely generated group satisfying the Rapid Decay property, i.e.,\nthere are constants C, d > 0p\nsuch that kak \u2264 Ckak2,d for all a \u2208 C\u0393. The weighted l2 -norm k*k2,d\nP\nP\n|ag |2 (1 + |g|)2d , where | * | denotes the word-length. Examples\nis given by\nag g 2,d =\nof groups satisfying the Rapid Decay property include free groups [13] and, more generally,\nhyperbolic groups [10], groups of polynomial growth [15], and many other groups [5], [11], [17],\n[22].\n\bP\nP\nConsider the weighted l2 -space l2s \u0393 =\nag g :\nag g 2,s < \u221e . For s > d, l2s \u0393 is\na Banach subalgebra of C\u2217r \u0393 ([17, Prop.1.2]). Lafforgue's goal is the isomorphism K\u2217 (l2s \u0393) \u2243\nK\u2217 (C\u2217r \u0393), so he shows that l2s \u0393 is a spectral subalgebra of C\u2217r \u0393.\nAlternatively, one can adopt the\n\u0001s relative perspective. Let \u03c9s be the subexponential weight\non \u0393 given by \u03c9s (S) = 1 + R(S) , where R(S) is the radius of the ball centered at the identity\nthat circumscribes S. For s > d, we have kak \u2264 Ckak2,s and kak2,s \u2264 \u03c9s (supp a)kak2 \u2264\n\u03c9s (supp a)kak for all a \u2208 C\u0393. From Proposition 8.2 it follows that K\u2217 (l2s \u0393) \u2243 K\u2217 (C\u2217r \u0393).\n8.3. \u03a31 -groups. We consider groups \u0393 for which the inclusion l1 \u0393 \u0592\u2192 C\u2217r \u0393 is spectral relative\nto C\u0393. Let us refer to such groups \u0393 as \u03a31 -groups. That is, \u0393 is a \u03a31 -group if rl1 \u0393 (a) \u2264 kak for\nall a \u2208 C\u0393. The \u03a31 condition is the l1 analogue of the \"l2 -spectral radius property\" discussed\nin [12, Def.1.2 ii) & Sec.3]. The major difference is that the \"l2 -spectral radius property\" is\nsatisfied by Rapid Decay groups, e.g. by hyperbolic groups, whereas \u03a31 -groups are necessarily\namenable:\nProposition 8.5. We have:\na) \u03a31 is closed under taking subgroups;\nb) \u03a31 is closed under taking directed unions;\nc) \u03a31 -groups are amenable;\nd) \u03a31 -groups do not contain F S2 , the free semigroup on two generators;\ne) groups of subexponential growth are \u03a31 -groups.\nProof. a) An embedding \u039b \u0592\u2192 \u0393 induces isometric embeddings l1 \u039b \u0592\u2192 l1 \u0393, C\u2217r \u039b \u0592\u2192 C\u2217r \u0393.\nb) Let \u0393 be the directed union of the \u03a31 -groups (\u0393i )i\u2208I . If a \u2208 C\u0393, then a \u2208 C\u0393i for some i\nand we know that rl1 \u0393i (a) = rC\u2217r \u0393i (a) can also be read as rl1 \u0393 (a) = rC\u2217r \u0393 (a).\nc) Let \u0393 be a \u03a31 -group. The inclusion l1 \u0393 \u0592\u2192 C\u2217r \u0393 factors as l1 \u0393 \u0592\u2192 C\u2217 \u0393 \u0589 C\u2217r \u0393. It follows\nthat C\u2217 \u0393 \u0589 C\u2217r \u0393 is spectral relative to C\u0393, so necessarily C\u2217 \u0393 \u0589 C\u2217r \u0393 is an isomorphism, i.e.,\n\u0393 is amenable.\nHere is another argument. By a), it suffices to show that \u0393 is amenable in the case \u0393 is\nfinitely generated, say by a finite symmetric set S. For a \u2208 R+ \u0393 we have kan k1 = kakn1 , so\nrl1 \u0393 (a) = kak1 . We obtain rC\u2217r \u0393 (\u03c7S ) = rl1 \u0393 (\u03c7S ) = k\u03c7S k1 = #S. By Kesten's criterion, \u0393 is\namenable.\nd) Let \u0393 be a \u03a31 -group and assume, on the contrary, that x, y \u2208 \u0393 generate a free subsemigroup. If the support of a \u2208 C\u0393 generates a free subsemigroup then kan k1 = kakn1 , hence\nrl1 \u0393 (a) = kak1 . Together with the \u03a31 condition, this gives kak = kak1 for those a \u2208 C\u0393 whose\nsupport generates a free subsemigroup. Consider now a = 1 + ix + ix\u22121 \u2208 C\u0393. On one hand,\nthe support of (yx)a generates a free subsemigroup, so kak = k(yx)ak = k(yx)ak1 = kak1 = 3.\nOn the other hand, we have kak2 = kaa\u2217 k = k3 + x2 + x\u22122 k \u2264 5, a contradiction.\n\n\f20\n\nBOGDAN NICA\n\ne) This was proved in Example 8.3.\n\n\u0003\n\nThus \u03a31 -groups include the subexponential groups and are included among amenable groups\nwithout free subsemigroups. Note that there are examples, first constructed by Grigorchuk, of\namenable groups of exponential growth that do not contain free subsemigroups.\nRemark 8.6. If one considers the groups \u0393 for which the inclusion l1 \u0393 \u0592\u2192 C\u2217 \u0393 is spectral\nrelative to C\u0393, then the analogues of parts a), b), d), e) of Proposition 8.5 still hold.\nAfter Lafforgue, we say that a Banach algebra completion A\u0393 of C\u0393 is an unconditional\ncompletion if the norm k * kA of A\u0393 satisfies k|a|kA = kakA for all a \u2208 C\u0393, where |a| denotes the\npointwise absolute value. The simplest example of unconditional completion is l1 \u0393. For groups\nwith the Rapid Decay property, l2s \u0393 (s \u226b 1) is an unconditional completion. In light of [18],\none is interested in finding unconditional completions A\u0393 having the same K-theory as C\u2217r \u0393.\nOne way to achieve K\u2217 (A\u0393) \u2243 K\u2217 (C\u2217r \u0393) would be to have A\u0393 and C\u2217r \u0393 completely spectrally\nequivalent over C\u0393. For amenable groups, however, one cannot do better than \u03a31 -groups:\nProposition 8.7. Let \u0393 be amenable. If there is an unconditional completion A\u0393 with the\nproperty that A\u0393 and C\u2217r \u0393 are spectrally equivalent over C\u0393, then in fact l1 \u0393 and C\u2217r \u0393 are\nspectral over C\u0393, i.e., \u0393 is a \u03a31 -group.\nProof. We first show that rl1 \u0393 (a) = rC\u2217r \u0393 (a) whenever a \u2208 C\u0393 is self-adjoint. The spectral\nequivalence of A\u0393 and C\u2217r \u0393 yields kak = rC\u2217r \u0393 (a) = rA\u0393 (a) \u2264 kakA for all self-adjoint a \u2208 C\u0393.\nSince \u0393 is amenable, we get kak1 = k|a|k \u2264 k|a|kA = kakA for all self-adjoint a \u2208 C\u0393, so\nkak \u2264 kak1 \u2264 kakA for all self-adjoint a \u2208 C\u0393. It follows that rl1 \u0393 (a) = rC\u2217r \u0393 (a) for all\nself-adjoint a \u2208 C\u0393.\nNext, one needs to adapt the proof of Proposition 3.2 to the following \u2217-version:\nLet \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a dense \u2217-morphism between Banach \u2217-algebras, and let\nX \u2286 A be a dense \u2217-subalgebra. If rB (\u03c6(x)) = rA (x) for all self-adjoint x \u2208 X,\nthen \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is spectral relative to X.\nIndeed, let x \u2208 X with \u03c6(x) invertible in B; we show x invertible in A. Pick (xn ) \u2286 X such\nthat \u03c6(xn ) \u2192 \u03c6(x)\u22121 . Then \u03c6((xxn )(xxn )\u2217 ) \u2192 1, so\n\u0001\nrA (1 \u2212 (xxn )(xxn )\u2217 ) = rB \u03c6(1 \u2212 (xxn )(xxn )\u2217 ) \u2192 0.\nIt follows that (xxn )(xxn )\u2217 is invertible in A for large n. Similarly, (xn x)\u2217 (xn x) is invertible in\nA for large n. We conclude that x is invertible in A.\n\u0003\n\nThe above proof becomes even simpler if one makes the (natural) assumption that the unconditional completion A\u0393 is a Banach \u2217-algebra. One then argues, as in the proof of Lemma 3.3,\nthat kak \u2264 kakA for all a \u2208 C\u0393.\nReferences\n[1] Aupetit, B.: Propri\u00e9t\u00e9s spectrales des alg\u00e8bres de Banach, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 735, Springer,\n1979\n[2] Badea, C.: The stable rank of topological algebras and a problem of R.
