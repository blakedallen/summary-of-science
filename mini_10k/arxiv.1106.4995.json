Indeed, the electronic\nstructure and the Landau level spectrum differ significantly depending on the stacking order in FLG.7\u201311\nFor instance, Bernal (ABA)-stacked trilayer exhibits an\nelectric-field tunable band overlap,12,13 while rhombohedral (ABC)-stacked trilayer is predicted to present a\ntunable band gap.7,10,11 To date, no direct evidence of\nthe electric-field and stacking-order dependent transport\nproperties has yet been reported in double-gated devices.\nIn the simplest tight-binding model that includes only the\nnearest intra- and inter-layer hopping parameters \u03b30 and\n\u03b31 (Fig. 1(b)), the Landau level spectrum of\n\u221a the ABA trilayer can be viewed as a superposition of B-dependent\nmonolayer-like LLs and B-dependent bilayer-like LLs\n(Fig. 1(c)). On the other hand, LLs ofp\nthe ABC trilayer\n(Fig. 1(d)) are given by En \u221d B 3/2 n(n \u2212 1)(n \u2212 2)\nwith Berry's phase 3\u03c0.7,8 Despite the substantial difference in the LL spectrum, 3-fold degenerate zero-energy\nLLs with 4-fold spin and valley degeneracy are expected\nto result in QHE plateaus at filling factor sequences\n\u03bd = \u00b16, \u00b110, \u00b114... for the trilayer graphene indepen-\n\ndently of the stacking order.7,8,14,15 However, the lack of\ninversion symmetry in ABA trilayer may lead to a broken valley degeneracy, while the valley degeneracy of LLs\nis guaranteed in the inversion-symmetric ABC trilayer.15\nHere, we report stacking-dependent transport properties\nof double-gated trilayer graphene, combined with Raman\nspectroscopy. We show that the effects of applied electric and magnetic fields on the ABC-stacked trilayers are\nstrikingly different from those on the ABA-stacked trilayers.\nOur experiments have been performed on single- and\ndouble-gated trilayer graphene devices16,17 prepared by\nexfoliating graphite on Si/SiO2 substrates.

The\ndc magneto-transport properties were studied at liquidHelium temperatures in pulsed perpendicular magnetic\nfields of up to 50 T. The magnetic-field pulse resulted\nfrom the discharge of a large capacitor bank with a capacitance of 30 mF and a voltage up to 20 kV and lasted\ntypically ' 500 ms.\nAll our investigated graphene samples have been reliably identified as trilayers and their stacking order has\nbeen determined by means of Raman spectroscopy. We\nused an excitation laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and\na spot size of 1.5 \u03bcm in diameter. The Raman spectra of\nmechanically exfoliated graphene shows two peaks: the\nG band and the 2D (G0 ) band at respectively 1580 cm\u22121\nand 2700 cm\u22121 (Fig. 2(a)). The G band is due to the\nfirst-order Raman scattering by the double degenerate\nE2g phonon mode at the Brillouin zone center, while the\n2D band originates from a second-order process, involving two intervalley optical phonons near the boundary of\nthe Brillouin zone.18 The peak at 520 cm\u22121 (labeled as\nSi) is due to the first-order Raman scattering by optical\nphonons of the Si substrate.\nA reliable approach to count the number of layers (N )\nof FLG deposited on Si/SiO2 substrates is based on the\nratios of the intensities of the G peak and the Si peak,\nIG /ISi .19 As shown in Fig. 2(a), for a flake containing\nup to 7 layers, the intensities of the G and Si peaks\nclearly change with N . We find that IG /ISi increases\nmonotonically and discretely with N due to an increase\nof the intensity of the G peak and a decrease of the intensity of the Si peak. Our findings are in agreement\nwith recent observations, which attribute this behavior\nto enhanced absorption and Raman scattering of light\nby thicker graphene layers.19 In Figure 2(b), we show the\nRaman spectra of all trilayers investigated here. These\nsamples have G and 2D peaks of similar intensities and\ntheir IG /ISi is consistent with the typical values found for\ntrilayer graphene.\nAn accurate determination of N for up to three layers is also possible from the 2D peak since its shape\nand position evolves with N (see Fig. 2(a)). The 2D\nband is affected by the band structure of the material\nsince it arises from a double-resonance process involving transitions among various electronic states. As trilayer graphene has three valence and three conduction\nbands, up to 15 electronic transitions can contribute to\nthe 2D band.20 However, many of these different processes have very close energy separations and experimentally it is found that the minimum number of Lorentzian\nfunctions necessary to correctly fit the 2D mode of trilayer graphene is six.20,21 Consistently, Fig. 2(c) shows\nthat for all the investigated trilayer graphene samples a\ngood fit can be achieved with 6 Lorentzian functions.\nHaving determined the number of layers, we now address the stacking order in our trilayer samples. It has\nbeen recently demonstrated that an accurate and efficient\nmethod to characterize stacking order in FLG is based\non the distinctive features of the Raman 2D peak.21 We\n\n2600\n\n2650\n\n2700\n\n2750\n\n2800\n\nRaman shift (cm -1)\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Raman spectra for graphene samples with different number of layers.

In particular,\nthe Lorentzians with the highest intensities - i.e., centered around 2685 cm\u22121 (green) and 2715 cm\u22121 (purple)\n- have very different intensities in the ABC samples (TG1\nand TG2), whereas they have almost equal intensities in\nthe ABA trilayers (TG3), in agreement with the observations reported in Ref. [21].\nWe now turn our attention to the transport properties\nof trilayer graphene in double-gated transistor structures.\nThis device geometry allows the independent control of\nthe Fermi energy and the external perpendicular electric\nfield Eex applied to the trilayers. In particular, the Eex\nis given by Eex = Vtg /dtg \u2212 Vbg /dbg with Vtg and Vbg\nthe top- and back-gate voltages respectively, and dtg and\ndbg the thicknesses of the top- and back-gate dielectric.\nFig. 3(a) and (c) show the 2-terminal square resistance\n(Rsq ) of trilayers with different stacking orders, measured\nfor fixed values of Vtg as a function of Vbg . In all cases\nmax\nRsq displays a maximum (Rsq\n) corresponding to the\ncharge neutrality in the system. Clearly, the evolution of\nmax\nRsq\nwith Eex is markedly different for the two stacking\nmax\norders. For ABC trilayer Rsq\nincreases with increasing\nEex , whereas the opposite behavior is observed for ABA\nmax\ntrilayer, i.e. Rsq\ndecreases with increasing Eex .

We find QHE plateaus\nonly away from the charge neutrality point (CNP) located at VCNP \u223c 20 V for Vtg = 0 (Fig. 4(b)). An additional plateau develops at \u03bd = 12, rather than at the\nexpected \u03bd = 14, upon further increase of Eex (for example at Vbg = -90 V with Vtg = -5 V). This observation\nsuggests lifting of the valley degeneracy induced by the\ninterlayer potential asymmetry,15 imposed by the top and\nback gates.\nThe\nABA-stacked\ntrilayer\ndevice\n(TG3,\n\u03bc \u2248 1100 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 ) develops QHE plateaus at\n\u03bd = 2, 4, 6, and 8 with a step of \u2206\u03bd = 2 (Fig. 4(c)).\nThis observation is consistent with a recent theoretical\nprediction which includes the complete set of hopping\nparameters up to the next-nearest layer couplings \u03b32 and\n\u03b35 .23 This extended model predicts relative energy shifts\nof the monolayer-like and bilayer-like LLs in the ABA\ntrilayer and a valley split of the zero-energy LLs by the\n\u03b32 and \u03b35 .

Theory predicts that\nthe interlayer asymmetry induced by the electric field\nopens an energy gap in the band structure of ABC trilayers (Fig. 3(b)),7,10,11 whereas it causes a band overlap in ABA trilayers (Fig. 3(d)).13 The electric-field tunable energy dispersion is a unique characteristic of fewlayer graphene materials, and it paves the way to devices\nwith unprecedented functionalities. Recent experiments\nin double-gated bilayer transistors have demonstrated an\non/off current ratio of 100 at room temperature.22 On the\nother hand, very little is known experimentally on the\nelectric-field tunability of the band structure of thicker\nfew-layers and their stacking dependence.\nFig. 4 illustrates the effect of a perpendicular magnetic\nfield on the transport properties of ABA and ABC trilayer graphene at T = 4.2 K. For ABC-stacked trilayer\n(TG1, \u03bc \u2248 1900 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 ) the 2-terminal magnetoresistance shows well-defined QHE plateaus at \u03bd = 6 and 10\nfor B > 20 T (Fig. 4(a)). The filling factor \u03bd = ns \u03c60 B \u22121 ,\nwhere \u03c60 is the flux quantum, matches well with the carrier density ns = \u03b1(Vbg \u2212 VCNP ) calculated using \u03b1 =\n7.2 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 V\u22121 .

In addition, the presence of the external\nelectric field generally splits the valley degeneracy of\nthe LLs by the induced interlayer asymmetry.15 As\nopposed to the case of ABA trilayer, the electric-fieldinduced valley splitting is expected to be smaller for\nthe inversion-symmetric ABC trilayer. Therefore, the\n4-fold spin and valley degeneracy is retained for the\nABC trilayer device, resulting in QHE plateaus at \u03bd = 6\nand 10. Under the large external electric field, however,\nthe valley splitting leads to the QHE plateau at \u03bd = 12.\nDuring the writing of our manuscript, we became\naware of preprints dealing with QHE in ABA24 and\nABC trilayers.25\u201327 In Ref. [24], QHE plateaus in the\nABA trilayer are observed at \u03bd = \u00b12, \u00b14, -6 but not at\n\u03bd = + 6. The absence of a plateau at \u03bd = +6 is attributed to LL crossing. As pointed out in the Ref. [24],\nactual plateaus developing in the ABA trilayer can depend on a specific B (or in our case Vbg ) where measurements are performed, due to the LL crossing between\nthe monolayer-like and the bilayer-like subbands. For the\nABC trilayer, Refs. [25] and [27] report QHE plateaus at\n\u03bd = \u00b16, \u00b110, \u00b114..., consistent with our results except\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n14\n15\n\ne-mail:sungho.jhang@physik.uni-regensburg.de\nK.

[26] observed rather\nunexpected plateaus at \u03bd = \u00b19, \u00b118, and -30.\nIn summary, we have investigated transport properties\nof trilayer graphene with different stacking order. Samples with ABA and ABC stacking differ characteristically\nin the sequence of quantum Hall plateaus, in agreement\nwith recent theory. The stacking order provides an additional degree of freedom to tune the electronic properties\nof trilayer graphene, combined with the interlayer asymmetry controlled by top and back gates.\nWe thank A.
