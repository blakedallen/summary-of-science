We show that it can also arise due to averaging\nover many jet events in a transversally expanding background. We find that the jet-induced awayside yield does not depend on the details of the energy-momentum deposition in the plasma, the\njet velocity, or the system size. Our claim can be experimentally tested by comparing soft-hard\ncorrelations induced by heavy-flavor jets with those generated by light-flavor jets.\nPACS numbers: 12.38.Mh, 25.75.Bh, 25.75.Gz\n\nRHIC data have convincingly shown [1\u20134] that a hot\nand dense medium is created in ultrarelativistic collisions\nof heavy ions. This medium is most likely the so-called\nquark-gluon plasma (QGP), predicted by quantum chromodynamics to be the hot and dense phase of strongly\ninteracting matter [5]. The QGP was found to behave\nlike an almost perfect fluid and to be opaque to jets created in the initial stage of the collision [6]. This raises\nthe possibility of using the energy deposited by the jet in\nthe medium, observable by correlations of soft and hard\nparticles, as a probe of the medium's properties.\nThe experimental soft-hard correlation function [7\u201310]\nexhibits an interesting double-peak structure at angles\nopposite to the trigger jet. It has been suggested [11, 12]\nthat such a structure is evidence for Mach cones. If the\nQGP is an opaque low-viscosity fluid, Mach cones result\nfrom the interference of sound waves generated by the\nenergy deposited by a supersonic jet [13].\nThe Mach cone leads to an excess of low-pT hadrons\nbeing emitted at an angle that is roughly \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6M with\nrespect to the trigger jet, where the Mach-cone angle \u03c6M\nis given by Mach's law, cos \u03c6M = cs /vjet . Here, cs is the\nspeed of sound and vjet is the jet velocity. If the leading\nparton of the jet is light, we have vjet \u2243 1, while for a\nheavy-flavor leading parton, vjet < 1. Measuring \u03c6M and\nvjet , one could in principle extract c2s = dp/de and hence\nthe QGP equation of state (EoS) p(e), where p is the\npressure and e the energy density.\nPrevious calculations [14\u201323] have shown that the formation of a double-peak structure on the away-side of\nsoft-hard correlations can be very sensitive to the underlying assumptions about the jet-medium interaction\n[24]. In the case of a static medium [14, 17, 22], there are\ntwo factors that impair the observation of conical correlations, even in a perfect fluid. First, the thermal smearing\nat the freeze-out surface [25] broadens the away-side peak\nfor low-pT particles [14, 17, 20]. Second, if the momentum deposited by the jet is larger than a certain threshold, a diffusion wake moving in the opposite trigger-jet\ndirection may overwhelm any signal from the Mach cone\n\n[17, 22] and leads to a single peak on the away-side. Finally, the above discussion neglects the effects of the expanding medium on the signal. The strong longitudinal\nand transverse expansion of the QGP will distort the\nMach-cone signal [26]. In Ref. [27] it was suggested that\nthe diffusion wake may be reduced by transverse flow\nwhile longitudinal expansion should lead to a broadening\nof the double-peak structure [16].\nIn this letter we demonstrate that the double-peak\nstructure observed on the away-side of soft-hard correlations could be of different origin. In our calculations\ntwo effects conspire to create the observed \"conical\" signal: the averaging over wakes created by jets in different\nevents and the deflection of the particles emitted from\nthe wakes by the collective transverse flow. The resulting \"conical\" signal is found to be quite robust against\nvariations of the energy-momentum deposition mechanism and the system size. The observed \"cone\" angle is\nalso nearly independent of the jet velocity, in contrast to\nthe scenario where the double-peak structure is due to\nMach cones. Therefore, even for events where vjet < cs\nand proper Mach cones are not formed, the intrinsic nonlinearities of the fluid-dynamical equations give rise, after\nfreeze-out, to conical structures on the away-side that are\nstrikingly similar to those produced by a Mach cone.\nWe use (3+1)-dimensional ideal fluid dynamics [28] to\nstudy the evolution of the QGP,\n\u2202\u03bc T \u03bc\u03bd = S \u03bd .\n\n(1)\n\nThe energy-momentum tensor of the fluid is T \u03bc\u03bd = (e +\np)u\u03bc u\u03bd \u2212 p g \u03bc\u03bd , where u\u03bc is the four-velocity of the fluid.\nThe conservation equations (1) are closed by using an\nEoS, in our case that for an ideal gas of gluons, p = e/3.\nThe source term S \u03bd on the right-hand side of Eq. (1) is\nthe energy and momentum deposited by a jet.\nWe use a transverse initial energy density profile corresponding to particle creation in central Au+Au and\nCu+Cu collisions according to the Glauber model. The\nmaximum temperature is T = 200 MeV for Au+Au and\nT = 176 MeV for Cu+Cu (since we use an ideal gas EoS\n\n\f2\nthe exact value of the initial temperature for a given system does not play an important role in the analysis). In\nthe longitudinal direction, the system is assumed to be\nelongated over the whole grid, forming a cylinder. In\nthis way, we maximize the effect of transverse flow since\nthere is no additional dilution from longitudinal motion\nof the fluid. In our coordinates, the z-direction defines\nthe beam axis and the associated jet moves along the\nx-direction.\nAssuming that the energy and momentum lost by the\njet thermalizes quickly, we use the source term\n\u03bd\n\nS (x) =\n\nZ\u03c4f\n\n\u03c4i\n\nd\u03c4\n\ndM \u03bd u\u03b1 j \u03b1 (4)\n\u03b4 [x \u2212 xjet (\u03c4 )] ,\nd\u03c4 u0,\u03b2 j0\u03b2\n\n(2)\n\nwith the proper-time interval of the jet evolution \u03c4f \u2212\n\u03c4i , the (constant) energy and momentum loss rate\n~ /d\u03c4 ), and the location of the\ndM \u03bd /d\u03c4 = (dE/d\u03c4, dM\njet xjet . The factor u\u03b1 j \u03b1 /u0,\u03b2 j0\u03b2 , where j \u03b1 is the fourcurrent of color charges (u\u03b20 , j0\u03b2 are the initial fourvelocity and four-current of color charges at the center of\nthe system), takes into account that the medium expands\nand cools, thus reducing the energy-momentum loss rate.\nIn the following, we shall assume that j \u03b1 \u223c T 3 u\u03b1 . In\nnon-covariant notation, Eq. (2) reads\n\u001a\n\u001b\n[~x \u2212 ~xjet (t)]2\n1\n\u03bd\nexp \u2212\nS (t, ~x) = \u221a\n2\u03c3 2\n( 2\u03c0 \u03c3)3\n\u0012\n\u00153\n\u0013\u0014\ndE dM\nT (t, ~x)\n\u00d7\n,\n, 0, 0\n.\n(3)\ndt dt\nTmax\nIn the following we set \u03c3 = 0.3 fm. A temperature cut\nof Tcut = 130 MeV is applied to ensure that no energymomentum deposition takes place outside the medium.\nThe jet is assumed to move at a constant velocity through\nthe expanding medium [jet deceleration is not expected\nto lead to significant changes after freeze-out [22]].\nIn contrast to Ref. [15], we assume that the parton\nmoving through the QGP stops after it has deposited all\nof its energy. In the following, we consider the jet to\nbe generated by a 5 GeV parton. One can compare with\nexperimental data by assuming that, after fragmentation,\nthe leading hadron carries \u223c 70% of the parton's energy,\ncorresponding to a trigger-pT of 3.5 GeV.\nSince the experimental analysis can trigger on the jet\ndirection but not on the space-time location where the\njets are formed, one has to consider different jet trajectories pointing along the same direction but originating\nfrom different points (x, y) in the transverse plane [29].\nWe parametrize them as\nx = r cos \u03c6 ,\n\ny = r sin \u03c6 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere r = 5 fm is chosen to account for the fact that\nthe trigger jet originates from a point close to the surface. A more refined treatment [16] will qualitatively lead\n\nto the same result. We consider different values for the\nazimuthal angle (\u2206\u03c6 = 15 degrees) with respect to the\ntrigger axis (negative x-axis): \u03c6 = 90, . . . , 165 degrees,\ncorresponding to jets travelling through the upper half\nof the transversally expanding medium, \u03c6 = 180 degrees,\ncorresponding to a jet travelling along the (positive) xaxis, and \u03c6 = 195, . . . , 270 degrees, corresponding to jets\npropagating through the lower half of the medium.\nIn order to compare to experimental data, one has to\nconvert the fluid into particles. In this work, we use\nthe Cooper-Frye (CF) prescription [25] assuming energymomentum and entropy conservation across the so-called\nfreeze-out hypersurface which we take to be a surface at\nconstant time (isochronous freeze-out). This yields the\nsingle-inclusive particle spectrum dN/(pT dpT dyd\u03c6).\nIn the experiment, the trajectory of the jet is not\nknown and one has to measure the azimuthal correlation between the hard particles produced by the trigger\njet and the soft particles produced by the associated jet\ntraversing the medium. In our calculation, we mimic this\nsoft-hard correlation function by convoluting the singleinclusive particle spectrum obtained from the CF freezeout (which only considers the away-side particles) with a\nfunction representing the near-side jet,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c62\n1\nexp \u2212\n,\n(5)\nf (\u03c6) = p\n2\u2206\u03c62\n2\u03c0\u2206\u03c62\n\n(here \u2206\u03c6 = 0.4), resulting in a two-particle correlation\nfunction\nC2 (\u03c6) = Af (\u03c6) +\n\nZ2\u03c0\n0\n\nd\u03c6\u22c6\n\ndN\nf (\u03c6\u22c6 ) ,(6)\npT dpT dyd(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u22c6 )\n\nwhere (A, \u2206\u03c6) are chosen to simulate the near-side correlation. This function is then event-averaged (indicated\nby h*i), background-subtracted, and normalized, leading\nto the averaged two-particle correlation function\n\u0014\n\u0015\ndNback\nhCF (\u03c6)i = N hC2 (\u03c6)i \u2212\n,\n(7)\npT dpT dyd\u03c6\nwhere dNback /(pT dpT dyd\u03c6) is the single-inclusive particle spectrum for an event without jets and N \u22121 =\ndNback /(pT dpT dy).\nFigure 1 shows the two-particle correlation function\n(7) for pT = 2 GeV. The jets are assumed to propagate\nwith v = 0.999, depositing energy-momentum into the\nmedium according to Eq. (3) with dE/dt = 1 GeV/fm\nand dM/dt = 1/v dE/dt. This case is referred to as \"onshell\" deposition in the following. We observe a doublepeak structure resembling a Mach-cone signal. The reason is that the contributions from different jet trajectories, shown in the right panel of Fig. 1 for jets traversing\nthe upper half of the medium, add up to a peak at an\nangle \u03c6w < 180 degrees (long-dashed blue line in the left\n\n\f3\n\n0.035\n\n0.005\n\ntotal\nupper half\nlower half\n\n0.03\n\n0.003\n\n0.02\n\nCF(\u03c6)\n\n\u3008CF(\u03c6)\u3009\n\n0.025\n\n0.015\n\n0.002\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0\n\n0.005\n0\n-\u03c0/2\n\nJet 180\nJet 150\nJet 120\nJet 90\n\n0.004\n\n0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\u03c6 [rad]\n\n\u03c0\n\n3\u03c0/2\n\n-0.001\n-\u03c0/2\n\n0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\u03c6 [rad]\n\n\u03c0\n\n3\u03c0/2\n\nFIG. 1: Left panel: The two-particle correlation function (7) (solid black line) for an associated particle pT = 2 GeV. The longdashed blue and short-dashed magenta lines represent the averaged contribution from jets traversing only the upper or the lower\nhalf of the medium, respectively. Right panel: the unaveraged two-particle correlation function (7) from four representatively\nchosen different jet trajectories in the upper half of the medium.\n\npanel of Fig. 1), while the contributions from the jets\ntraversing the lower half of the medium produce a peak\nat an angle \u03c6w > 180 degrees (short-dashed magenta\nline in the left panel of Fig. 1). The value of \u03c6w depends\non how much the transversally expanding medium can\ndeflect the matter in the disturbance caused by the jet.\nThis, in turn, depends on the local flow velocity (both\nits magnitude and direction with respect to the associated jet) and temperature. The gap between the two\npeaks on the away-side depends on the pT of associated\nparticles. For small pT , thermal smearing is large and\nthe two peaks merge into a single broad away-side peak\n[30]. The same flow induced peak-to-valley ratio is found\nwithin 0.3% if a coarser \u2206\u03c6 = 30 degrees initial jet sampling is used. The robustness of the numerical results\nin Fig. 1 to numerical details underlines the universality\nof the radial flow mechanism as the primary source of\nnon-Mach away-side azimuthal correlations.\nFigure 2 shows that a similar double-peak structure as\nin the on-shell deposition scenario can also be obtained\nfor a pure momentum deposition scenario with dE/dt =\n0, and dM/dt = 1.0/v GeV/fm. Both scenarios lead to\napproximately the same apparent \"cone\" angle. On the\nother hand, due to thermal smearing a pure energy deposition scenario (with dE/dt = 1 GeV/fm and dM/dt = 0)\nonly exhibits a single broad peak for pT = 2 GeV. For a\nlarger pT = 3 GeV, the double-peak structure reappears,\nwith a similar \"cone\" angle as in the other deposition\nscenarios. Thus, in an expanding medium, the apparent\n\"cone\" shape resulting from averaging over many events\nis universal to all energy-momentum deposition scenarios, in contrast to the case of a static background [24].\nTherefore, we cannot draw conclusions about the jet deposition mechanism, although the pure energy loss scenario seems to be disfavored by the data, since the two\npeaks appear only at a higher pT .\nFinally, we demonstrate that the conical emission angle observed in Figs. 1 and 2 also appears for subsonic\n\njets (which should not be the case if it was due to a true\nMach cone). We consider a bottom quark with mass\nM = 4.5 GeV, propagating with v = 0.57 < cs through\nthe medium. The results for the correlation function (7),\ncomputed with the on-shell energy-momentum deposition scenario with dE/dt = 1 GeV, are shown in Fig. 3,\nwhere, for comparison, we also show results for v = 0.75.\nThe same double-peak emission structures are found\nfor all jet velocities, even for the subsonic jet, with nearly\nequal apparent \"cone\" angles. A comparison between\nthe away-side yield in Au+Au and Cu+Cu is also shown\nin Fig. 3. Remarkably, both systems are predicted in\nthis scenario to display a very similar away-side shoulder\nwidth in qualitative agreement with recent experimental results from the PHENIX collaboration [31]. While\nthe absolute normalization of hCF (\u03c6)i is sensitive to the\nfreeze-out temperature Tf , we found that the doublepeak structures in Au+Au are insensitive to variations\nof Tf between 130 MeV and 160 MeV. For Cu+Cu the\nweak dip at \u03c6 = \u03c0 is filled for pT = 2GeV but reappears\nat higher pT while the shoulder width remains similar\nto the Au+Au case. Three-particle correlations will be\npresented elsewhere.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that a double-peak structure on the away side of soft-hard correlations can originate generally from the coupling of jet fragments to the\nbackground transverse collective flow. In addition, the\napparent width of the away-side shoulder correlation is\n\"universal\" in the sense that it is insensitive to the details of the energy-momentum deposition mechanism as\nwell as to the system size, and that is similar for both\nsupersonic and subsonic \"jets\". This prediction can be\nreadily tested experimentally by comparing soft-hard correlations induced by heavy-flavor tagged jets [32] with\nthose induced by light-flavor jets at RHIC and LHC.\nB.B. is supported by the Alexander von Humboldt\nfoundation via a Feodor Lynen fellowship.
