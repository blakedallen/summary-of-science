It is found that \u03c3 and \u03c0 0 without electric charges have electromagnetic interaction effects coming from their internal structure. A general Lorentz transformation relative\nto external sources Jgauge = (JA\u03bc , JA\u03ba\u03bc ) is derived, using the general Lorentz transformation\nand the four-dimensional current of nuclear matter of the ground state with Jgauge = 0, we\ngive the four-dimensional general relations between the different currents of nuclear matter systems with Jgauge 6= 0 and those with Jgauge = 0. The relation of the density's coupling with\nexternal magnetic field is derived , which conforms well to dense nuclear matter in a strong\nmagnetic field. We show different condensed effects in strong interaction about fermions and\nantifermions, and give the concrete scalar and pseudoscalar condensed expressions of \u03c30 and \u03c00\nbosons. About different dynamical breaking and spontaneous vacuum symmetry breaking, the\nconcrete expressions of different mass spectra are obtained in field theory. This paper acquires\nthe running spontaneous vacuum breaking value \u03c30\u2032 , and obtains the spontaneous vacuum breaking in terms of the running \u03c30\u2032 , which make nucleon, \u03c3 and \u03c0 particles gain effective masses. We\nachieve both the effect of external sources and nonvanishing value of the condensed scalar and\npseudoscalar paticles. It is deduced that the masses of nucleons, \u03c3 and \u03c0 generally depend on\ndifferent external sources.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is well known that a lot of unified models of the electroweak and the strong interactions utilize\nsymmetry breaking. Now it is widely believed that the underlying laws of the world have essential\n1\n\n\fsymmetries[1]. It is that symmetric equations may have asymmetric solutions. And also there are\nvarious symmetry breaking in the world[2, 3]. Dynamical symmetry breaking of extended gauge\nsymmetries is given[4]. The Ref.[5] shows dynamical symmetry breaking in the sea of the nucleon,\nand the Ref.[6] investigates dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking by a neutrino condensate.\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking plays an important role for constructing the different unified\ntheories of the electroweak and the strong interactions, as well as gravity theory[7]. But the fundamental scalar field, e.g. Higgs particle, has not been discovered up to now, even though the\nlow energy limit of finding Higgs particle has been raised to very high[8], especially in testing the\nstandard model of the weak-electromagnetic interactions. The different grand unified theories have\nmany parameters adjusted to fit the experiments, which make the theoretical predication to physical properties be decreased. On the other hand, there are other mechanisms generating particle's\nmasses [9-12]. The Ref.[13] indicates that if the vacuum polarization tensor has a pole at light-like\nmomenta, gauge field may acquire mass. A classical \u03c3 model of chiral symmetry breaking was given\nin Ref. [14], and an in-medium QMC model parameterization quark condensation in nuclear matter\netc are studied in Ref[15, 16].\nThe pure interactions mediated by swapped mesons between fermions and antifermions possibly\nyield vacuum condensation of the fermion-antifermions pair [17], which makes vacuum degeneracy\nappears. Ref. [18] researched spontaneous and dynamical breaking of mean field symmetries in the\nproton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation and the description of double beta decay\ntransitions. And dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in gauge theories with extra dimensions is\nalso well described[19].\nDynamical electroweak breaking and latticized extra dimensions are shown up[20], using dynamical breaking, one may make fermions and bosons get masses, and may make the free adjusted\nparameters decrease, even to a dynamical group of one parameter.\nWhen considering the physical effect of a system coming from another system, a general quantitative causal conservation principle must be satisfied[21]. Using the homeomorphic map transformation satisfying the general quantitative causal conservation principle, Ref.[22] solves the hard\nproblem of the non-perfect properties of the Volterra process, the topological current invariants in\nRiemann-Cartan manifold and spacetime defects still satisfy the general quantitative causal conservation principle[23]. This paper illustrates the fact that \u03c3 and \u03c0 0 without electric charges having\nelectromagnetic interaction effects coming from their inner constructions are just result satisfying\nthe general causal conservation rule, i.e., the general quantitative causal conservation principle is\nessential for researching consistency of the model.\nIn general analyzing vacuum degeneracy, one studies only the degeneracy vacuum state originated\nfrom the self-action of scalar fields, one usually neglects the vacuum degeneracy originated from the\ninteractions of different fields.\nIn this paper, Sect.2 gives the basic formulation; Sect.3 studies different condensation about\nfermions and antifermions; Sect.4 gives the concrete expressions of different mass spectrum about\ndifferent vacuum breaking and dynamical breaking, and shows that the general four dimensional\nrelations between different currents of the nuclear matter systems with J6= 0 and those with J = 0;\nthe last Sect. is summary and conclusion.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nBasic Formulation\n\nThe Lagrangian of the general \u03c3-model with the symmetries of chiral SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R and electromagnetic U (1)EM is\nLj = L + \u03b7\u03c8 + \u03c8\u03b7 + J\u03c3 \u03c3 + J\u03c0 * \u03c0 + JA\u03bc A\u03bc .\n(2.2)\nEuler-Lagrange Equations of the system are\n[\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 ieA\u03bc + g(\u03c3(x) + i\u03c4 * \u03c0(x)\u03b35 )]\u03c8(x) \u2212 \u03b7(x) = 0,\n\u2190\n\n(2.3)\n\n\u03c8(x)[\u2212\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212ie\u03b3 \u03bc A\u03bc + g(\u03c3(x) + i\u03c4 * \u03c0(x)\u03b35 )] \u2212 \u03b7(x) = 0,\n\n(2.4)\n\n(\u0003 + \u03bb\u03bd 2 )\u03c3(x) \u2212 g\u03c8(x)\u03c8(x) \u2212 \u03bb\u03c3(x)(\u03c3 2 (x) + \u03c0 2 (x)) + J\u03c3 (x) = 0,\n\n(2.5)\n\n(\u0003 + \u03bb\u03bd 2 )\u03c0(x) \u2212 e2 A2\u03bc (x)\u03c0(x) \u2212 g\u03c8(x)i\u03c4 \u03b35 \u03c8(x) \u2212 \u03bb\u03c0(x)(\u03c3 2 (x) + \u03c0 2 (x)) + J\u03c0 (x) = 0,\n\n(2.6)\n\nand\n\u2202\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd + ie\u03c8(x)\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8(x) \u2212 e2 A\u03bc (x)\u03c0 2 (x) + JA\u03bc = 0.\n\n(2.7)\n\nThen we have\n\nh\u03c8(x)\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8(x)iJ0 \u2212ieh\u03c8(x)A\u03bc (x)\u03c8(x)iJ0 +gh\u03c8(x)\u03c3(x)\u03c8(x)iJ0 +ih\u03c8(x)\u03c4 *\u03c0(x)\u03b35 \u03c8(x)iJ0 \u2212h\u03c8(x)iJ0 \u03b7(x) = 0\n(2.8)\nand\n\u2190\n\nh\u03c8(x)\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8(x)iJ0 +ieh\u03c8(x)A\u03bc (x)\u03c8(x)iJ0 \u2212gh\u03c8(x)\u03c3(x)\u03c8(x)iJ0 \u2212ih\u03c8(x)\u03c4 *\u03c0(x)\u03b35 \u03c8(x)iJ0 +\u03b7(x)h\u03c8(x)iJ0 = 0.\n(2.9)\nWe can further obtain\n(\u0003 + \u03bb\u03bd 2 )h\u03c3(x)iJ0 \u2212 gh\u03c8(x)\u03c8(x)iJ0 \u2212 \u03bbh\u03c3(x)(\u03c3 2 (x) + \u03c0 2 (x)iJ0 + J\u03c3 (x) = 0,\n\n(2.10)\n\n(\u0003+\u03bb\u03bd 2 )h\u03c0(x)iJ0 \u2212e2 hA2\u03bc (x)\u03c0(x)iJ0 \u2212gh\u03c8(x)i\u03c4 \u03b35 \u03c8(x)iJ0 \u2212\u03bbh\u03c0(x)(\u03c3 2 (x)+\u03c0 2 (x))iJ0 +J\u03c0 (x) = 0, (2.11)\nJ\n\nh\u2202\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd i0 + ieh\u03c8(x)\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8(x)iJ0 \u2212 e2 hA\u03bc (x)\u03c0 2 (x)iJ0 + JA\u03bc (x) = 0,\n\n(2.12)\n\nin which for any field, we can define hY (x)iJ0 \u2261 h0out |Y (x)| 0in iJ0 /h0out | 0in iJ0 .\nThe generating functional of the system is\nZ(J) \u2261\n\nZ\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\nD\u03c8 [D\u03c8] [D\u03c3] [D\u03c0] [DA\u03bc ] exp\n\nUsing the generating function one have\n\n3\n\n\u0012 Z\n\u0013\ni\n4\nd xLJ\n~\n\n(2.13)\n\n\fhY (x)iJ0 = ~\n\n\u03b4W\n,\n\u03b4JY (x)\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere Z = eiW .\nOn the other hand, using the method of deducing connection Green function from Green function\nin quantum field theory[24, 25] we can have\n~\n\u03b4h\u03c3(x)iJ0\n~\n\u03b4 2 h\u03c3(x)iJ0\nh\u03c3 3 (x)iJ0 = (h\u03c3(x)iJ0 )3 + 3 h\u03c3(x)iJ0\n+ ( )2\n+ * * *,\ni\n\u03b4J\u03c3 (x)\ni \u03b4J\u03c3 (x)\u03b4J\u03c3 (x)\n\u03b4h\u03c0(x)iJ0\n~\nh\u03c3(x)iJ0\ni\n\u03b4J\u03c0 (x)\nJ\n2\n~\n\u03b4h\u03c3(x)i\n~\n\u03b4\nh\u03c3(x)iJ0\n0\n+ 2 h\u03c0(x)iJ0 *\n+ ( )2\n+ * * *,\ni\n\u03b4J\u03c0 (x)\ni \u03b4J\u03c0 (x) * \u03b4J\u03c0 (x)\n\nh\u03c3(x)\u03c0 2 (x)iJ0 = (h\u03c0 2 (x)iJ0 )2 h\u03c3(x)iJ0 +\n\nh\u03c0(x)A2\u03bc (x)iJ0 =\n\n(hA\u03bc (x)iJ0 )2 h\u03c0(x)iJ0 +\n\n~\n\u03b4hA\u03bc (x)iJ0\nh\u03c0(x)iJ0\ni\n\u03b4JA\u03bc (x)\n\n(2.15)\n\n(2.16)\n\n(2.17)\n\n~\n~\n\u03b4h\u03c0(x)iJ0\n\u03b4 2 h\u03c0(x)iJ0\n+ * * *,\n+ ( )2\n+2 hA\u03bc (x)iJ0\ni\n\u03b4JA\u03bc (x)\ni \u03b4JA\u03bc (x) * \u03b4JA\u03bc (x)\n\nhA\u03bc (x)\u03c0 2 (x)iJ0 =\n\n~\n\u03b4h\u03c0(x)iJ0\nhA\u03bc (x)iJ0 (h\u03c0(x)iJ0 )2 + hA\u03bc (x)iJ0\ni\n\u03b4J\u03c0 (x)\nJ\n2\nJ\n\u03b4hA\u03bc (x)i0\n~\n\u03b4 hA\u03bc (x)i0\n~\n+ ( )2\n+ * * *,\n+2 h\u03c0(x)iJ0 *\ni\n\u03b4J\u03c0 (x)\ni \u03b4J\u03c0 (x) * \u03b4J\u03c0 (x)\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhich are just a kind of new power expansion about the little quantity ~, which is essential for\nresearching the physics of different power series about ~.

Therefore, we\nobtain the average relation of nuclear matter density and electric charge density at the situation\nwithout external source as follows\n\u03c1g \u2261 h\u03c1B (x)iJ0 |J=0 =\n6\n\n\u2212c\nh\u03c1e (x)iJ0 |J=0 ,\ne\n\n(3.6)\n\n\fwhere \u03c1g is the ground state density of the fermi doublet, and \u03c1B (x) = \u03c8 + (x)\u03c8(x) is the density\noperator of the proton and neutron isospin doublet, Eq.(3.6)'s physical meaning is that the ground\nstate of nucleon density equates to the condensation of the electric charge density divided by electronic charge and multiplied by \u2212c, the condensation is the distribution of the ground state density\nof charged particles in nucleons.\nWe further get\ni\ni i J\nhj i |J=0 = h\u2202\u03bd F i\u03bd (x)iJ0 |J=0 = hj i iJ0 |J=0 \u2261 j0i ,\ne e 0\ne\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere j i = \u03c8(x)\u03b3 i \u03c8(x) is a vector current density of the nuclear matter.\nOn the other hand, because the interactions of UEM (1) and SUC (3) gauge fields generally affect\nthe state of the matter, when the corresponding external sources Jgauge = (JA\u03bc , JA\u03ba\u03bc ) 6= 0 (JA\u03bc and\nJA\u03ba\u03bc are external sources of the interactions of UEM (1) and SUC (3) gauge fields, respectively, \u03ba is\nSUC (3) color gauge group index ), we may generally assume a general equivalent velocity v ( of the\nnuclear matter system with Jgauge 6= 0) relative to the primordial (or called, ground state\u2032 s) nuclear\nmatter system with Jgauge = 0, because the equivalent relative velocity v is originated from the\nexternal sources Jgauge = (JA\u03bc , JA\u03b1\u03bc ) wth Lorentz subscriptions. In fact, the actions of the external\nsources make the nuclear matter system with Jgauge 6= 0 have the excited equivalently relative\nvelocity v. Therefore, the velocity v is the function of the external sources, i. e., v = v(JA\u03bc , JA\u03ba\u03bc ) =\nv(Jgauge ). Using a general Lorentz transformation we can obtain the relations of the four dimensional\ngeneral current of nuclear matter system ( with Jgauge 6=0 ) relative to the nuclear matter system (\nwith Jgauge = 0 ) of the ground state as follows\n\uf8ee\n\nj\u2032 = j0 + v(Jgauge ) \uf8f0( q\n1\u2212\n\n1\nv2 (Jgauge )\nc2\n\n\u2212 1)\n\n\uf8f9\n\nj0 *v(Jgauge )\n\u03c1g\n\uf8fb,\n\u2212q\nc2\nv2 (Jgauge )\n1\u2212\nc2\n\nj * v (Jgauge )\nc2\n\n\u03c1g \u2212 0\n\u03c1\u2032 = q\n1\u2212\n\nv2 (Jgauge )\nc2\n\n.\n\n(3.8)\n\n(3.9)\n\nWe, thus, can generally assume the velocity v(Jgauge ) linearly depends on the external sources.\nTherefore, we can obtain a general expression\nv(Jgauge ) = \u03b1A\u03bc JA\u03bc + \u03b1A\u03ba\u03bc JA\u03ba\u03bc\n\n(3.10)\n\nin which \u03b1A\u03bc and \u03b1A\u03ba\u03bc are the corresponding relative coupling constants of external sources JA\u03bc and\nJA\u03ba\u03bc , respectively. Thus, Eqs.(3.8) and (3.9) may be rewritten as two general expressions linearly\ndepending on the external sources as follows\nj\u2032 = j0 + (\u03b1A\u03bc JA\u03bc + \u03b1A\u03ba\u03bc JA\u03ba\u03bc ){( q\n1\u2212\n\u22121)\n\nj0 *(\u03b1A\u03bc JA\u03bc + \u03b1A\u03ba\u03bc JA\u03ba\u03bc )\nc2\n\n\u2212q\n1\u2212\n\n7\n\n1\n(\u03b1A\u03bc JA\u03bc +\u03b1A\u03ba\nJ \u03ba )2\n\u03bc A\u03bc\nc2\n\n\u03c1g\n(\u03b1A\u03bc JA\u03bc +\u03b1A\u03ba\nJ \u03ba )2\n\u03bc A\u03bc\nc2\n\n},\n\n(3.11)\n\n\fj0 * (\u03b1A\u03bc JA\u03bc +\u03b1A\u03ba\nJ \u03ba)\n\u03bc A\u03bc\n\n\u03c1g \u2212\n\u03c1 = q\n1\u2212\n\u2032\n\nc2\n(\u03b1A\u03bc JA\u03bc +\u03b1A\u03ba\nJ \u03ba )2\n\u03bc A\u03bc\n\n.\n\n(3.12)\n\nc2\n\nand the consistent condition is\n\u03b1A\u03bc JA\u03bc + \u03b1A\u03ba\u03bc JA\u03ba\u03bc < c\n\n(3.13)\n\nIn order to make the theory concrete, we consider a case when the external source JA\u03ba\u03bc equates\nto zero but external JA\u03bc . Then we gain the general case that there exists electromagnetic field,\nEqs.(3.11) and (3.12), thus, can be represented as\nj\u2032 = j0 + \u03b1A\u03bc JA\u03bc {( q\n1\u2212\n\n1\n(\u03b1A\u03bc JA\u03bc\nc2\n\n\u2212 1)\n\n)2\n\nj0 *\u03b1A\u03bc JA\u03bc\n\u2212q\nc2\n\nj0 * \u03b1A\u03bc JA\u03bc\nc2\n(\u03b1A\u03bc JA\u03bc )2\nc2\n\n\u03c1g \u2212\n\u03c1\u2032 = q\n1\u2212\n\n,\n\n\u03c1g\n1\u2212\n\n(\u03b1A\u03bc JA\u03bc )2\nc2\n\n},\n\n(3.14)\n\n(3.15)\n\nand the corresponding consistent condition is \u03b1A\u03bc < JAc . When \u03b1A\u03bc is generally chosen as the\n\u03bc\nmotion direction ex , and JA\u03bc is taken as magnetic field B, we, thus, can have\nj0x \u2212 \u03c1g \u03b1B\n,\njx\u2032 = q\n2\n1 \u2212 (\u03b1B)\n2\nc\n\u03c1g \u2212 \u03b1B\nc2 j0x\n,\n\u03c1\u2032 = q\n2\n1 \u2212 (\u03b1B)\nc2\n\n(3.16)\n\n(3.17)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the small parameter determined by the nuclear physical experiments under the external\nmagnetic field B.\nIn order to test the theory, considering the case of j0x = 0, in Eq.(3.17) we have\n\u03c1g\n\u03c1\u2032 = q\n.\n2\n1 \u2212 (\u03b1B)\nc2\n\n(3.18)\n\nBecause \u03b1 is the coupling parameter, Eq(3.18) shows the relation of density \u03c1\u2032 s coupling effect with\nexternal magnetic field, which conforms to Ref.[28]\u2032 s research about dense nuclear matter in a strong\nmagnetic field.\n\n4\n\nDifferent Mass Spectrum about Different Dynamical Breaking and Vacuum Breaking\n\nBecause \u03c30 and \u03c00 may be made from the condensations of fermion-antifermion, we can discuss the\nconcrete expressions of different mass spectrum about different dynamical breaking and different\nspontaneous vacuum symmetry breaking as follows:\n\n8\n\n\f( i ) When considering the following dynamical breaking\nh\u03c8(x)\u03c8(x)iJ0 |J=0 6= 0, h\u03c8(x)\u03b35 \u03c4 \u03c8(x)iJ0 |J=0 = 0,\n\n(4.1)\n\n\u03c00 = 0, \u03bb\u03c30 (\u03bd 2 \u2212 \u03c302 ) = gh\u03c8(x)\u03c8(x)iJ0 |J=0 = \u2212gtrSF (0),\n\n(4.2)\n\nwe has\nthe corresponding spontaneous vacuum symmetry breaking is\n\u03c3(x) \u2212\u2192 \u03c3(x) + \u03c30 ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nthe Lagrangian density, thus, is\n\nL=\n\n1\n\u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03c8(x)[\u03b3 \u03bc (\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ieA\u03bc ) + mf ]\u03c8(x) \u2212 g\u03c8(x)[\u03c3(x) + i\u03c4 * \u03c0(x)\u03b35 ]\u03c8(x)]\n4\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212 (\u2202\u03bc \u03c3(x))2 \u2212 m2\u03c3 \u03c3 2 (x) \u2212 (\u2202\u03bc + ieA\u03bc )\u03c0 + (x) * (\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ieA\u03bc )\u03c0(x) \u2212 m2\u03c0 \u03c0 2 (x)\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03bb 2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212 (\u03c3 (x) + \u03c0(x)) \u2212 \u03bb\u03c30 \u03c3(x)(\u03c3 (x) + \u03c0 (x)) \u2212 gtrSF (0)\u03c3(x).\n4\n\n(4.4)\n\nOne obtains that the fermion doublet masses are\nmf = g\u03c30 .\n\n(4.5)\n\nMasses of \u03c3(x) and \u03c0(x), respectively, are\nm2\u03c3 = \u03bb(3\u03c302 \u2212 \u03bd 2 ) = 2\u03bb\u03c302 + gSF (0)/\u03c30 ,\n\n(4.6)\n\nm2\u03c0 = \u03bb(\u03c302 \u2212 \u03bd 2 ) = gtrSF (0)/\u03c30 .\n\n(4.7)\n\nThus, when there is no dynamical breaking, we obtain \u03c302 = \u03bd 2 , which just shows \u03bd 2 's physical\nmeaning, i.e., \u03c30 is, in this case, just the spontaneous vacuum breaking parameter, and m2\u03c0 = 0.\nEven so, \u03c3 particles and fermions acquire masses, namely m2\u03c3 = 2\u03bd 2 , mf = g |\u03bd| . Therefore, the\nmasses of \u03c3 particle and fermion doublet naturally come from only the vacuum breaking structure.\nIn general case, when there exist both dynamical breaking and spontaneous vacuum breaking, not\nonly \u03c0 meson and fermions gain masses, but also \u03c3 and \u03c0 masses are not equal. More generally,\nwe may take \u03c30\u2032 = h\u03c8(x)\u03c8(x)iJ0 in which \u03c30\u2032 is the running spontaneous vacuum breaking value. It\nmeans that \u03c30\u2032 is the exciting state, which make fermion doublet, \u03c3 particle and \u03c0 gain effective\nmasses relative to different external sources.\n( ii ) when \u03c30 = 0 , \u03c00 = 0 , analogous to the research about Eqs.(4.6) and (4.7), we get \u03c3(x)\nand \u03c0(x) meson having the same mass[24]\nm2\u03c3 = m2\u03c0 = \u2212\u03bb\u03bd 2 .\n\n(4.8)\n\nFurther using Eq.(4.5) in the cases of \u03c30 = 0 and \u03c00 = 0, we obtain the fermion doublet keeping\nno mass.\n( iii ) General dynamical breaking\n9\n\n\fWe now consider a general dynamical breaking. From Eqs.(3.2) and (3.3) we see that\n\u03c30 = Kgh\u03c8(x)\u03c8(x)iJ0 |J=0 6= 0, \u03c00 = iKgh\u03c8(x)\u03b35 \u03c4 \u03c8(x)iJ0 |J=0 6= 0.\n\n(4.9)\n\nThen the corresponding spontaneous vacuum symmetry breaking are\n\u03c3(x) \u2212\u2192 \u03c3(x) + \u03c30 , \u03c0(x) \u2212\u2192 \u03c0(x) + \u03b5\u03c00 , 0 \u2264 \u03b5 \u2264 1,\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere \u03b5 is a running breaking coupling parameter determined by different physical experiments.\nBecause electromagnetic interaction is very weaker than strong interaction, electromagnetic interaction may be neglected.

The mechanisms of gaining masses are more direct\nand useful for constructing the weak-electromagnetic standard model without Higgs fields. For\nmaking fermions and bosons in the other models acquire masses, it may make the too many adjusting\nparameters of fitting with the physical experiments in the usual unified models decrease. We, further,\ngenerally deduce that the masses of nucleons, \u03c3 and \u03c0 have the effects coming from interactions\nwith external source. It can be seen that \u03c3 and \u03c0 0 may be made from the different condensations of\n10\n\n\ffermion and antifermion. This lead to that \u03c3 and \u03c0 0 without electric charge have electromagnetic\ninteraction effects coming from their inner construction. Using the all general research of this\npaper,we can very more study the interactions between different fundamental particles in general\nsituation, all these will be written in the other papers.\n\n5\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nWe show up a general SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R \u00d7U (1)EM \u03c3- model with external sources, dynamical breaking and spontaneous vacuum symmetry breaking. We present the general basic formulations of the\nmodel. This paper founds the different condensations about fermions and antifermions in which the\nconcrete scalar and pseudoscalar condensed expressions of \u03c30 and \u03c00 bosons are shown up. We have\nshown that \u03c3 and \u03c0 0 may be made from the different condensations of fermion and antifermion.\nWe have discovered that \u03c3 and \u03c0 0 without electric charge have electromagnetic interaction effects\ncoming from their inner construction, which is similar to neutron. Using a general Lorentz transformation and four dimensional condensed currents of the nuclear matter of the ground state with\nJ = 0 we deduced the four dimensional general relations of different currents of the nuclear matter\nsystem with J 6= 0 relative to the ground state\u2032 s nuclear matter system with J = 0, and give the\nrelation of density \u03c1\u2032 s coupling effect with external magnetic field. This conforms to Ref.[28]'s research about dense nuclear matter in a strong magnetic field. We also get the concrete expressions\nof different mass spectrum about different dynamical breaking and spontaneous vacuum breaking.\nThis paper has given running spontaneous vacuum breaking value \u03c30\u2032 in terns of the technique of\nexternal sources, has obtained spontaneous vacuum symmetry breaking based on the \u03c30\u2032 , which make\nnuclear fermion doublet, \u03c3 and \u03c0 particles gain effective masses relative to external sources. We\nhave found out the mechanisms of mass production of fermion doublet and bosons (\u03c3 and \u03c0 ). The\nmechanism is useful for constructing the unified weak-electromagnetic model without fundamental\nscalar fields. The effect of external sources and nonvanishing values of the scalar and pseudoscalar\ncondensations are given in this theory, we generally deduce that the masses of nucleons, \u03c3 and \u03c0\npartly come from the interactions with different external sources.\nAcknowledgment: The authors are grateful to Prof. Z.
