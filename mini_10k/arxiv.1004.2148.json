RUEDA AND JUANA SENDRA\nAbstract. In [5] the authors present an algorithm to parametrize approximately \u01ebrational curves, and they show in 2 examples that the Hausdorff distance, w.r.t. to the\nEuclidean distance, between the input and output curves is small. In this paper, we analyze this distance for a whole family of curves randomly generated and we automatize the\nstrategy used in [5]. We find a reasonable upper bound of the Hausdorff distance between\neach input and output curve of the family.\n\nIntroduction\nThe problem of the approximate parametrization of algebraic plane curves goes as follows:\ngiven a plane algebraic curve C (that is the perturbation of a rational plane curve) and\na tolerance \u01eb > 0, we want to find a new curve C, being rational, as well as a rational\nparametrization of it such that C and C are at certain small distance dependent on \u01eb.\nIn [2] and [3] it was seen how to approximately parametrize algebraic plane curves and\nalgebraic surfaces having an \u01eb-singularity of maximum multiplicity. In [5], using the techniques of \u01eb-points developed in [2] and [4], we extended the results in [2] to the general\ncase of algebraic affine plane curves. More precisely, we provide in [5] the approximate\nparametrization algorithm which given C returns an approximate parametrization P(t) of\nthe curve C.\nA natural question arises, the closeness between the input and output curves of the\nalgorithm. In our case, this closeness notion is given by the Hausdorff distance. That is, we\nsay that the input and output curves are close if their Hausdorff distance (as real curves) is\nsmall related to the tolerance. We proved in [5] that the Hausdorff distance between C and\nC is finite.\nIn this paper, apply the approximate parametrization algorithm to a family of curves F\nof degree 4 which was randomly generated. For each curve C in F we compute a bound B\nof the Hausdorff distance between C and C. For all of the curves we get B \u2264 2.2 and we\nobtain evidences that the actual distance is experimentally \u2264 0.1.\nThe paper is organized as follows. We recall the approximate parametrization algorithm\nin Section 1. In Section 2 we explain how the family F of curves of degree 4 was generated.\nThe last section is devoted to the analysis of the distance between the the curves of F and\ntheir approximate parametrizations output by our algorithm.\nThe following terminology will be used throughout the paper. k * k and k * k2 denote the\npolynomial \u221e\u2013norm and the usual unitary norm in C2 , respectively. | * | denotes the module\n\u2212\n\u2192\nin C. The partial derivatives of a polynomial g \u2208 C[x, y] are denoted by g v := \u2202 i+j g/\u2202 i x\u2202 j y,\nDate: January 2010.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSONIA L.

Recalling the parametrization algorithm\nIn this section we recall the algorithm presented in [5] as well as its main properties; see\n[5] for further details. We start with a fixed tolerance \u01eb, and with the implicit equation\nf (x, y) of a real plane algebraic curve C of exact degree d, which is the perturbation of a\nrational curve. C is supposed to satisfy that:\n(1) the degree d of f is proper; this means that there exists a partial derivative of f , of\norder d, that in module is strictly bigger than \u01ebkf k.\n(2) f is \u01eb-irreducible.\n(3) C has d different points at infinity, and it does not pass through (1 : 0 : 0), (0 : 1 : 0).\nConditions (1) and (2) guarantee that, under the tolerance, we really have an irreducible\ncurve of degree d. Condition (3) ensures that C is either compact (as a subset of R2 ) or it\nfollows real asymptotes. Therefore, we are excluding curves having a parabolic behavior.\nThe requirement on (1 : 0 : 0), (0 : 1 : 0) is technical and it can be achieved by performing\na suitable and orthogonal linear change of coordinates.\nThe theoretical argumentation of the algorithm is as follows. First, the notion of exact\nsingularity is replaced by the concept of \u01eb-singularity, similarly with the notions of exact\nmultiplicity and \u01eb-multiplicity. Here, the first complication appears since the number of\n\u01eb-singularities is bigger than (expected) in the exact case; probably due to the perturbation.\nIn order to deal with this difficulty we associate to each \u01eb-singularity a radius, and hence\nwe see it as an Euclidean disk. Next, we introduce an equivalence relation on the set of\ndisks and we define the \u01eb-singular clusters as the equivalence classes. Then, we define the\n\u01eb-multiplicity of the cluster as the maximum of the \u01eb-multiplicities within the class, and we\ntake as canonical representant of the cluster an \u01eb-singularity where the \u01eb-multiplicity of the\ncluster is achieved. In this situation, we say that C is \u01eb-rational if the clusters satisfy the\nwell-known genus formula of the exact case. More precisely, if {Cluster ri (Qi )}i=1,...,s is the\ncluster decomposition (Qi denotes the canonical representant and ri the \u01eb-multiplicity of the\ncluster), we say that C is \u01eb-(affine) rational if\n(d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2) \u2212\n\ns\nX\n\nri (ri \u2212 1) = 0.\n\ni=1\n\nNow, let us assume that C is \u01eb-rational, an let us see how the approximate parametrization\nalgorithm proceeds. The basic idea is, as in the exact case (see [7]), to construct a suitable\nlinear system of curves of degree d \u2212 2. More precisely, if\n{Clusterri (Qi )}i=1,...,s , Qi = (qi1 : qi2 : 1)\nis the cluster decomposition, we compute d \u2212 3 simple \u01eb\u2013points on C, say {P1 , . . . , Pd\u22123 }\nwith Pi = (pi1 : pi2 : 1). Again, we associate to each \u01eb-point an Euclidean disk via a radius,\nand we apply the equivalence relation. If, somehow, any Pi is identified with another Pj or\nwith a singular cluster, we replace Pi by a new \u01eb-point. In this situation, we consider the\n\n\fPARAMETRIZATION OF \u01eb-RATIONAL CURVES: ERROR ANALYSIS\n\n3\n\neffective divisor\nD=\n\ns\nX\ni=1\n\nri Qi +\n\nd\u22123\nX\n\nPi\n\ni=1\n\nand the (exact) linear system H of curves of degree (d \u2212 2) given by D. That is, H is the\nlinear system of curves of degree d\u22122 having Qi as (ri \u22121)-base points, and Pi as simple base\npoints. If we were working exactly, all intersection points in H \u2229 C would be fixed (namely\nthose points in D) with the exception of one point that would provide the parametrization.\nIndeed, in the exact case, the parametrization would be\nResy (H(x, y, 1), f )\nResx (H(x, y, 1), f )\n, Qs\nQs\nQd\u22123\nQd\u22123\nr\n(r\n\u22121)\nri (ri \u22121)\ni i\ni=1 (x \u2212 qi,1 )\ni=1 (y \u2212 qi,2 )\ni=1 (x \u2212 pi,1 )\ni=1 (y \u2212 pi,2 )\n\n!\n\n,\n\nbeing H(x, y, z) the homogeneous polynomial defining H. In the approximate case, instead\nof the exact division above, we take the quotient of the Euclidean division of each numerator\nby the corresponding denominator.\nThe output curve derived from this process has the same structure at infinity as the input\ncurve and the same degree, see [5], Theorem 4.5. These properties will play a fundamental\nrole in the error analysis (see Section 3). We outline the algorithm derived from the above\nideas.\n(1) Compute the singular cluster decomposition {Cluster ri (Qi )}i=1,...,s ; say Qi = (qi,1 :\nqi,2P: 1).\n(2) If si=1 ri (ri \u2212 1) 6= (d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2), RETURN \"C is not (affine) \u01eb-rational\".

Generating a family of \u01eb-rational curves\nIn this section, we generate the family of curves that will be used in the error analysis.\nWe fix three points P1 = (2 : 0 : 1),P2 = (0 : 0 : 1) and P3 = (1 : 1 : 1) in P2 (C) and we\nconsider the linear system of curves of degree 4 defined by the divisor 2P1 + 2P2 + 2P3 . Its\ndefining polynomial is\nG(x, y, z, u1 , . . . , u6 ) = u2 y 2 z 2 + u3 y 3 z + u4 y 4 + u5 xyz 2 \u2212 (2u2 + 3u3 + 4u4 + 21 u5 + 2u6 )xy 2 z +\nu6 xy 3 + u1 x2 z 2 + (\u2212 23 u5 + 2u3 + 4u4 + 2u6 \u2212 u1 )x2 yz + (u2 + u3 + 21 u5 + 14 u1 + u4 )x2 y 2 \u2212\nu1 x3 z + ( 21 u5 \u2212 u3 \u2212 2u4 \u2212 u6 + 12 u1 )x3 y + 41 u1 x4 .\nNote that for every specialization of ui such that G(x, y, z, u1 , . . . , u6 ) is irreducible, we\nget an (exact) rational curve.\nNow, for j = 1, . . . , 6 and i = 1, . . . , 10 let rij be a random integer number in the interval\n[0, 100]. We obtain 60 different polynomials Gij (x, y, z), j = 1, . . . , 6, i = 1, . . . , 10 setting\n\u001a rij i\nif k = j\n( 100 )\nk = 1, . . . , 6\nuk =\n1\nif k 6= j\nin G(x, y, z, u1 , . . . , u6 ). Given i \u2208 {1, . . . , 6} and j \u2208 {1, . . . , 10} we obtain a random\nperturbation gij (x, y) \u2208 R[x, y] of Gij (x, y, 1) as follows\nr1\nr2 2\ngij (x, y) = Gij (x, y, 1) + \u01eb\n(x + y) + \u01eb2\n(x + xy + y 2 )+\n100\n100\nr3 3\n(x + x2 y + xy 2 + y 3 )\n\u01eb3\n100\n1\nwhere r1 , r2 , r3 are integer numbers taken randomly in the interval [0, 100] and \u01eb = 100\n. The\npolynomials gij (x, y), j = 1, . . . , 6, i = 1, . . . , 10 have proper degree 4 and define 60 curves\nh (C h is the projective closure of C ) and such that\nCij verifying (1 : 0 : 0), (0 : 1 : 0) \u2208\n/ Cij\nij\nij\nthey have 4 different points at infinity. Therefore, each of 60 curves satisfies the hypothesis\nrequired in parametrization algorithm.\nUsing the parametrization algorithm described in Section 1, we conclude that 28 of the\n60 curves are \u01eb\u2013rational. We show those curves in Fig. 1. An statistical error analysis was\ngiven in [6]. The precise equations of Cij as well as the parametrizations provided by the\nalgorithm can be found in\nhttp://www.aq.upm.es/Departamentos/Matematicas/srueda/fam4.pdf.\n\n3. Theoretical strategy for the error analysis\nWe describe the theoretical strategy for the error analysis that will be employed in the\nlast section. Let \u01eb > 0 be the tolerance, C the input curve and C the output curve provided\nby the approximate parametrization algorithm. Also, let f (x, y) and f (x, y) be the defining\npolynomials of C and C, respectively. Moreover, let P(t) be the parametrization of C output\nR\nby the algorithm.

For this purpose, we will proceed in a similar manner\nto Section 6 in [5], not only for a couple of examples, but for the whole family of \u01eb-rational\ncurves randomly generated in Section 2. More precisely, we consider the normal line to C\nat the generic point P(t), say L1 (t, s), as well as the normal line to C at the generic point\n(a, b) \u2208 C R , say L2 (a, b, s). Moreover, we introduce the polynomials\nD1 (t, s) = f (L1 (t, s)) \u2208 R(t)[s], D2 (a, b, s) = f (L2 (a, b, s)) \u2208 C(C)[s],\nwhere R(t) denotes the algebraic closure of R(t) and C(C) the field of rational functions over\nC. In addition, for every t0 \u2208 R, such that D1 (t0 , s) is well defined and has real roots, and\nfor every (a0 , b0 ) \u2208 C R , such that D2 (a0 , b0 , s) is well defined and has real roots, we take\n\u03c1R\n1 (t0 ) = min{|s0 | / D1 (t0 , s0 ) = 0 and s0 \u2208 R},\n\u03c1R\n2 (a0 , b0 ) = min{|s0 | / D2 (a0 , b0 , s0 ) = 0 and s0 \u2208 R}.\nR\nThen, the supremum of \u03c1R\n1 (t), \u03c12 (a, b) provides an upper bound of the Hausdorff distance;\nat least for those subsets of both curves where the considered minimums are well defined.\nR\nBecause of computational difficulties, in our analysis, instead of computing \u03c1R\n1 (t), \u03c12 (a, b),\nwe will study\n\u03c11 (t0 ) := min{|s0 | / D1 (t0 , s0 ) = 0},\n\u03c12 (a0 , b0 ) := min{|s0 | / D2 (a0 , b0 , s0 ) = 0}.\n\nThese quantities bound d(P(t0 ), C) and d((a0 , b0 ), C) respectively (here, we understand that\nR\nd is the unitary distance in C2 ), instead of d(P(t0 ), C R ) and d((a0 , b0 ), C ). So, for those\nsubsets of both curves, where the corresponding polynomials are well defined, we bound\nR\n\n\u2206(C R , C ) := max{supt\u2208R {d(P(t), C)}, sup(a,b)\u2208C R {d((a, b), C)}}.\n\n\f6\n\nSONIA L. RUEDA AND JUANA SENDRA\n\nFor this purpose, in the next section, we will follow the next steps:\n(1) We compute a bound of supt\u2208R {d(P(t), C)}, by applying Corollary 6.2 in [5] that\nensures that\n(\n)\n1\ni\nA\n(t)\n0\nd(P(t), C) \u2264 min (ni )\nwhere Ai (t) 6= 0 and 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n ,\nAi (t)\nwhere D1 (t, s) = An (t)sn + * * * + A0 (t).\n(2) In order to bound sup(a,b)\u2208C R {d((a, b), C)}) one may apply the same corollary as\nin (1). However, it implies to maximize a bivariate rational function under the\nconstrain f (x, y) = 0. This can be done, for instance, using Lagrange multipliers.\nNevertheless, in practice, this is unfeasible. Instead, we estimate the bound by taking\na lattice of points (a, b) \u2208 C where we bound d((a, b), C).\nR\n(3) Note that the quantity \u2206(C R , C ) gives information on how close every real point on\nR\neach of the curves is of a complex point on the other curve. However, \u2206(C R , C ) \u2264\nR\nH(C R , C ). To avoid this difficulty, in our analysis, we will look for empirical evR\nR\nidences indicating that the computed bound of \u2206(C R , C ) also bounds H(C R , C );\nfor that we test empirically that, in our computations, \u03c11 (t0 ) = \u03c1R\n1 (t0 ), \u03c12 (a0 , b0 ) =\n(a\n,\nb\n).\n\u03c1R\n0 0\n2\n(4) It may happen for some t0 \u2208 R that \u03c1R\n1 (t0 ) is not well defined or simply that\nthe bound it provides of d(P(t0 ), C R ) is not satisfactory. Observe that to bound\nd(P(t0 ), C R ) we can use the intersection of any line through P(t0 ) with C. So in\nsome cases we will also proceed in the following way.\nLet us consider the line at the generic point P(t) in the direction given by h \u2208 R\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2h\nh2 \u2212 1\n, p2 (t) + s 2\nLh (t, s) = p1 (t) + s 2\n.\nh +1\nh +1\nWe introduce the polynomial Dh (t, s) = f (Lh (t, s)) \u2208 R(t, h)[s]. For a fixed h0 \u2208\nR and for every t0 \u2208 R, such that Dh0 (t0 , s) is well defined and has real roots,\nd(P(t0 ), C R ) \u2264 \u03c1R\nh0 (t0 ), where\n\u03c1R\nh0 (t0 ) = min{|s0 | / Dh0 (t0 , s0 ) = 0 and s0 \u2208 R}.\nR\nThus, the supremum of \u03c1R\nh0 (t) and \u03c12 (a, b) provides an upper bound of the Hausdorff\ndistance. Then for t0 \u2208 R such that Dh0 (t0 , s) is well defined, we may study\n\n\u03c1h0 (t0 ) := min{|s0 | / Dh0 (t0 , s0 ) = 0}\nwhich is an upper bound of d(P(t0 ), C) and plays the role of \u03c11 (t0 ) in the previous\nsteps.\n4. Execution of the error analysis\nLet F be the family of 28 \u01eb-rational curves of degree 4 defined in Section 3. For each curve\nR\nC in F we explain next how the bound of \u2206(C R , C ) was computed and show evidences that\nR\nthis bound is also an upper bound of the Hausdorff distance H(C R , C ).\n\n\fPARAMETRIZATION OF \u01eb-RATIONAL CURVES: ERROR ANALYSIS\n\n7\n\n4.1. Bound of supt\u2208R {d(P(t), C)}. Let us denote by \u039b the domain of D1 (t0 , s). If the curve\nis compact then the polynomial D1 (t0 , s) is well defined for every t0 \u2208 R, otherwise it is not\ndefined for two real poles \u03b21 , \u03b22 of P(t). In the family F only two curves are compact.\nIn order to bound supt\u2208R {d(P(t), C)}, we obtain an upper bound of \u03c11 (t) when t \u2208 \u039b.\n\u0001 A0 (t) 21\nA0 (t)\n4\n(see\nFor this purpose we maximize the functions R1 (t) = 4 A\nand\nR\n(t)\n=\n2\n2\nA2 (t)\n1 (t)\nstep (1) in Section 3) in \u039b as follows.\nLet \u03b11 and \u03b12 be the real roots of the denominator of R1 (t). For all the curves in F,\n\u03b11 and \u03b12 are not real roots of the denominator of R2 (t). Let Ii , i = 1, 2 be an interval\nisolating \u03b1i from \u03b1j , j 6= i and from the real poles of R2 (t). Observe that R1 (t) and R2 (t)\nare continuous in R \\ (I1 \u222a I2 ) and in the adherence I1 \u222a I2 of I1 \u222a I2 , respectively.

Empirical bound of sup(a,b)\u2208C R {d((a, b), C)}). In this section we estimate the bound\nof sup(a,b)\u2208C R {d((a, b), C)}). We estimate the bound by taking a lattice of points (a, b) \u2208 C\nR\nwhere we bound d((a, b), C) estimating \u03c1R\n2 (a, b). We show evidences for \u03c12 (a, b) being small\nR\nand for \u03c12 (a, b) = \u03c12 (a, b).\nIf the curve is not compact, first we analyze the behavior of the input and output curves\nthrough the real asymptotes. Let us suppose that C is a non compact curve in F and let\nL1 and L2 be its real asymptotes. By [5], Corollary 4.6 the real asymptotes of C and C are\nparallel lines so the Hausdorff distance between them can be easily computed. Let L1 and\nL2 be the real asymptotes of C parallel to L1 and L2 respectively. We the value of\n\n\u03b7 = max{H(L1 , L1 ), H(L2 , L2 ))}\nfor all the non compact curves of F in the next table. Then we proceed as follows:\n(1) For each negative integer i we compute the set \u03a9i of intersections of C R with the line\nR\nx = i. We obtain mR\ni := max{\u03c12 (a, b) | (a, b) \u2208 \u03a9i } and mi := max{\u03c12 (a, b) | (a, b) \u2208\nR\n\u03a9i }, and we check that mi = mi .\n(2) We repeat the previous step until\nR\nmin{|\u03c1R\n2 (i, b) \u2212 H(L1 , L1 )|, |\u03c12 (i, b) \u2212 H(L2 , L2 )| / (i, b) \u2208 \u03a9i } < \u03b5.\n\n(3) Let \u03c41 be the smallest value of i until termination of this process.\nWe perform this experiment also for each positive integer i to obtain in this case the\nhighest value \u03c42 such that the inequality in step (2) holds. At the same time we check that\n\n\fPARAMETRIZATION OF \u01eb-RATIONAL CURVES: ERROR ANALYSIS\n\n9\n\nmR\ni = mi with positive integers i = 1, . . . , \u03c42 .

It may happen that these\nk\nroots are all complex. However, in our example, we see that \u03c11 ((\u221210)k ) = \u03c1R\n1 ((\u221210) ) for\nk\nk\nR\nk = 1, . . . , 20. Let \u03c71 = min{\u03c1R\n1 ((\u221210) ) | k = 1, . . . , 20} and \u03c72 = max{\u03c11 ((\u221210) ) | k =\n1, . . . , 20}.

In some cases for a given t0 \u2208 R the set {|s0 | / D1 (t0 , s0 ) = 0 and s0 \u2208 R} is\nempty or \u03c1R\n1 (t) and \u03c11 (t) happen to be different. Then it should be taken into consideration\nthat there exists h0 \u2208 R such that \u03c1R\nh0 (t0 ) < \u221e.\nR\nLet sc denote {\u03c11 (tk )} for the sequence {tk } to the critical point c of R1 (t). For curves\nnumber 5, 11, 18, 20 and 22 the sequence sc could not be computed for some critical point\nc of R1 (t). For example, curve C5 has 6 critical points and the sequence sc1 for critical\npoint c1 was not defined. We write max{0.009579373594, sc1 } where 0.009579373594 is the\nmaximum of the values at which the rest of the sequences stabilized.\nThe results for \u03b32 marked with (*) indicate that \u03c1R\n1 (tk ) 6= \u03c11 (t) for the sequence {tk } to\none of the critical points of R1 (t).
