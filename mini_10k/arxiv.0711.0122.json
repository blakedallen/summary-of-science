Sin e minimal (in stability theoreti\n\ntermi-\n\nnology) formulas are (\u00fe-)minimal, we have no remorse overriding this terminology. As for minimal types, we will see that stable minimal types (over\nalgebrai ally\n\nlosed sets) are stationary of\n\nin the stability theoreti\n1.2.\n\nU-rank\n\n1, and therefore minimal\n\nsense as well.\n\nCoordinatisation.\n\nThe aim of this subse tion is to show that in super-\n\nrosy theories of \u001cnite \u00fe-rank (and so, in parti ular those theories interpretable in an o-minimal stru ture) minimal types\n\nontrol the stru ture of\n\nthe theory, justifying our fo using of the analysis on them.\nthat su h theories are\n\nWe will prove\n\noordinatised (in the sense of \u009f4 of [3\u2104) by \u00fe-minimal\n\ntypes.

Then there is some b\u2032 |= tp(b/A) su h that p(x, a) \u222a p(x, b\u2032 )\ndoes not \u00fe-fork over A and a \u2323\n| \u00feA b\u2032 .\nProof of Lemma 2.12. Let p(x, a) be as in the statement, \u03c6(x, y) any for-\n\n\u03c8(y, a) := (dp(x,a) x)\u03c6(x, y), the \u03c6-de\u001cnition of p(x, a).\n\u00fe\nBy Fa t 2.13 there is some b |= tp(a/A) su h that a |\n\u2323 A b and p(x, a) \u222a\np(x, b) does not \u00fe-fork over A; in parti ular it does not \u00fe-fork over Aa and\ntherefore has a ompletion q \u2208 S(Aba) whi h does not \u00fe-fork over Aa. By\nLemma 2.7 q does not fork over Aa.\nIt follows from Lemma 2.11 that q is de\u001cnable over acl(Aa). By symmetry\nq is also de\u001cnable over acl(Ab). Therefore |= (\u2200y)(\u03c8(y, a) \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c8(y, b)). So\nmula, and\n\nif we de\u001cne\n\nz \u2243 w \u21d0\u21d2 \u2200y(\u03c8(y, z) \u2194 \u03c8(y, w))\nwe get that [b]\u2243 \u2208 acl(Aa) and [a]\u2243 \u2208 acl(Ab). Sin e tp(a/Ab) is non algebrai (otherwise a \u2208 acl(A) and we have nothing to do) it has in\u001cnitely\nmany realizations so {w | a \u2243 w} is in\u001cnite.\nLet e := [a]\u2243 ; if e \u2208 acl(A) the lemma follows, so assume towards a\nontradi tion that e 6\u2208 acl(A). By de\u001cnition the formula \u0010 [x]\u2243 = e\u0011 2-\u00fe\u00fe\ndivides over A so in parti ular it witnesses that a 6 |\n\u2323 A e. But b |= p with\na\u2323\n| \u00feA b and e \u2208 acl(Ab) so a \u2323\n| \u00feA e, a ontradi tion.\n\u0003\n\nRemark 2.14.\n\nIt may be tempting to try and prove the last lemma using\n\nClaim 2.6 in a stronger way than we have (p(x, a) is stable and non \u00fe-\n\nA and therefore non-forking over A), but we have to be areful:\n\u03c6(x, a) \u2208 p(x, a) forks over A (for some \u03c6(x, y) over A) Claim 2.6 provides\nus with a formula \u03b8(x) \u2208 p(x, a) (that is over Aa) su h that \u03b8(x) \u2227 \u03c6(x, y)\nhas NOP. This will not tell us anything about the behaviour of \u03c6(x, y) over\nA.\nforking over\nif\n\nThis shows that while Claim 2.6 is useful when trying to understand forking relations between a stable type and its extensions, understanding de\u001cnability and forking relations between a stable type and its restri tions\nrequires more subtlety.\n\n\fMINIMAL TYPES IN SUPER-DEPENDENT THEORIES\n\n11\n\nThe main result of this se tion is now easy to prove, and will be useful\nlater on:\n\nTheorem 2.15. Let p(x, a) \u2208 S(Aa) be a stable type in a model of a dependent rosy theory and assume that p(x) := p(x, a) \u21beA is unstable. Then\np(x, a) \u00fe-forks over A.\nProof.\n\n\u03c6(x, y) any formula over A and assume\np(x, a) does not \u00fe-fork over A. By Lemma 2.11\np(x, a) has a \u03c6-de\u001cnition over acl(Aa) and by Lemma 2.12 this de\u001cnition is\nover acl(A). So \u03c6(x, b) \u2208 p if and only if b |= (dp x)\u03c6(x, y); sin e (dp x)\u03c6(x, y)\nis over acl(A) and \u03c6(x, y) was arbitrary it follows that p(x, a) does not fork\nover acl(A). But by assumption p(x) is unstable. This ontradi ts Fa t\n\u0003\n2.5.\nLet\n\ntowards a\n\np(x, a)\n\nbe a stable type,\n\nontradi tion that\n\nAs a \u001crst appli ation of the above theorem we get:\n\nTheorem 2.16. Let p \u2208 S(A) be any type of \u001cnite U\u00fe -rank in a dependent\n\nrosy theory. Then p is stable if and only if some (equivalently, any) non\n\u00fe-forking q \u2287 p is oordinatised by stable types.\nProof.\n\nLet a |= p. By Theorem 1.12 there is a non \u00fe-forking extension\ntp(a/E) of p whi h is oordinatised by a sequen e ha0 , . . . , an i su h that\ntp(ai+1 /Aa1 . . . ai ) is minimal and ai \u2208 acl(Ea). It is now easy to he k\n(using Fa t 2.1) that tp(a/E) is stable if and only if tp(ai+1 /Aa1 . . . ai ) is\nfor all i. But Theorem 2.15 implies that tp(a/E) is stable if and only if\ntp(a/A) is, so the theorem follows.\n\u0003\nIn parti ular we get:\n\nCorollary 2.17. A super-dependent theory\n\nT of \u001cnite rank is stable if and\n\nonly if every \u00fe-minimal type in T is stable (if and only if every \u00fe-minimal\ntype in T has U-rank one).\nIn a rosy theory the notion of orthogonality and hen e also that of \u00feregular types are naturally de\u001cned.\n\nIn super-rosy theories every type is\n\ndomination equivalent to the sum (in the appropriate sense) of \u00fe-regular\ntypes. It is therefore natural to ask:\n\nQuestion 2.18.\n\nLet\n\nT\n\nbe a super-dependent theory. Is\n\nif every \u00fe-regular type in\n\nT\n\nT\n\nstable if and only\n\nis stable ?\n\n3.

It will su\u001e e to show\n\u221e\nthat if \u00fe((\u2203 x, y)C(x, y; z\u0304)) = n then there exists a Z -de\u001cnable subfamily\nof C(x, y, ; z\u0304) of o-minimal dimension n. We may assume (otherwise the\n\u221e\n\u00fe\nlaim is trivial) that n > 0 and that if (\u2203 x, y)C(x, y; \u0101) and U (a/\u2205) = n\nthen C(x, y) is not an almost onstant urve (namely, for generi (c, d) |=\n| \u00fe \u0101 and c \u2323\n| \u00fe \u0101).\nC(x, y; \u0101) both d \u2323\nWe may assume that C(x, y; z\u0304) is \u2205-de\u001cnable (in Z ); let \u0101 be su h that\n(\u2203\u221e x, y)C(x, y; \u0101) and \u00fe(a/\u2205) = n. By oordinatisation there exists some\nB \u2286 N and a1 , . . . , an su h that\nWe only need to prove the left to right dire tion.\n\nany normal\n\na\u2323\n| \u00fe B,\nU\u00fe (a1 /B) = 1,\nU\u00fe (ai+1 /Ba1 , . . . , ai ) = 1 for all i \u2265 1 and\nan = \u0101.\nWe may also assume that all the N -de\u001cnable subsets of Z de\u001cned over B are\nZ -atomi , so without loss of generality B = \u2205 as well. Let (c, d) |= C(x, y, \u0101)\nfor some generi c \u2208 Z , so d \u2208 Z and d \u2208 acl(c, a1 , . . . , an ). Adding onstants\nto the language, we may minimise n to assure that d \u2208\n/ acl(c, a1 , . . . , an\u22121 )\n\u00fe\n\u00fe\nso - as U (an /a1 , . . . , an\u22121 ) = 1 and an |\n\u2323 a1 ,...,an\u22121 c - we on lude that\nan \u2208 acl(c, d, a1 . . . , an\u22121 ). By indu tion on n, it follows that we an \u001cnd\nc\u0304, d \u0304 \u2286 Z su h that C(x, y; \u0101) is de\u001cnable over c\u0304, d \u0304. Sin e the same is true of\n\u2032\n\u0003\nany a \u2261 a, we get the desired on lusion.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nRemark 4.5.\n\nThe proof of the previous lemma is based on the proof of\n\nLemma 2.3 of [14\u2104. It is not\n\nlear to us, however, whether Lemma 4.4\n\nan\n\nbe strengthened to give the full result of Peterzil and Star henko and assure\n\n\f22\n\nA. HASSON AND A. ONSHUUS\n\nthat a\n\nlosed interval in an o-minimal set de\u001cnable in a super-rosy theory of\n\n\u001cnite rank is stably embedded.\nWe\n\nan now pro eed to proving the Theorem 4.1:\n\nAssume \u001crst that\n\np is lo\n\nally modular. If it is stable then by Theorem 3.17\n\nit is seriously stable and seriously minimal, and the result now follows from\nthe analogous statement in the stable\n\nontext (see Theorem 5.1.1 of [16\u2104)\n\nand the fa t that stable sets in dependent theories are stably embedded. So\nwe may assume that\n\np\n\nis unstable.\n\nextension of p is non-trivial. In\np has an almost o-minimal extension q (by Proposition 4.3). Being\nnon-trivial, so is every non-algebrai almost extension of q . So there is a \u001cnite\nequivalen e relation \u223c su h that q/ \u223c is a generi type in some de\u001cnable ominimal set Z . By Lemma 4.4 q/ \u223c is non-trivial, and sin e p were not ri h,\nneither is q/ \u223c. The result now follows from the Tri hotomy theorem for\nBy Remark 3.3(4) every non-algebrai\n\nparti ular,\n\no-minimal stru tures.\nNow, let\n\np\n\nbe a non lo ally modular type. If\n\np\n\nis stable then by Theorem\n\n3.17 it is seriously stable and by Bue hler's di hotomy it is strongly minimal.\n\np\n\nSo we may assume that\n\na |= p\n\nany realization.\n\nextension\n\np \u2287 q0\n\nq0 .\n\nis unstable. In that\n\nBy Proposition 4.3,\n\nq0\n\np0 := p \u21be acl(\u2205)\n\nand\n\nhas an almost o-minimal\n\na |= q0 . Be ause\n\u223c be a de\u001cnable\nq := q0 / \u223c is o-minimal.\n\nUsing automorphisms we may assume that\n\nit must be that\n\nq0\n\nis not lo ally modular.\n\nequivalen e relation with \u001cnite\nSin e\n\nase, let\n\np0\n\nlasses su h that\n\nis not lo ally modular neither is\n\nas a an o-minimal type. By Remark 3.4\n\nLet\n\nq , and it is not lo ally modular also\nq is ri h (as an o-minimal type). So\n\nby the Tri hotomy Theorem for o-minimal stru tures there is a de\u001cnable real\nlosed \u001celd, of whi h\nof\n\np\n\nq\n\nis an extension. Thus,\n\nextending a de\u001cnable real\n\nThis \u001cnishes the proof of Theorem 4.1.\nWe\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nis an almost extension\n\n\u0003\n\nan now sum up our \u001cndings by:\n\nCorollary 4.6. Let\nThen:\n\np/ \u223c\n\nlosed \u001celd, as required.\n\nM be a stru ture de\u001cnable in an o-minimal theory.\n\nM interprets a real losed \u001celd if and only if there is a minimal\n\nnon-lo ally modular (non trivial) global type.\nAssuming Zilber's Tri hotomy onje ture M interprets a pure algebrai ally losed \u001celd if and only if it has a minimal non-lo ally modular stable type.\nReferen es\n\n[1\u2104 C.
