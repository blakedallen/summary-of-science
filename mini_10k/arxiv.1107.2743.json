Lovelock [1] extended the Einstein tensor, which is only symmetric and conserved\ntensor depending on the metric, to the most general tensor. In higher dimensional spacetimes, the Lovelock theory is the most nature extension of general relativity and its field\nequations of motion contain the most symmetric conserved tensor with no more than two\nderivative of the metric. It has been argued that the Gauss-Bonnet term appears as the\nleading correction to the effective low energy action of the string theory. Until now, the analytic expressions of static and spherically symmetric Gauss-Bonnet black hole solutions have\nbeen investigated in [2\u20134], and of Born-Infeld-Gauss-Bonnet models in [5\u20137]. The thermodynamics of the uncharged static spherically Gauss-Bonnet black hole solutions have been\nconsidered in [8\u201310] and of charged solutions in [11]. R. A. Konoplya et al. [12, 13] presented an analysis of the scalar perturbations in the background of Gauss-Bonnet black hole\nspacetimes and its (in)stability in high dimensions. Very recently the quasinormal mode of a\nscalar field in five-dimensional Lovelock black hole spacetime for different angular quantum\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\nEmail:yueruihong@nbu.edu.cn\nEmail:zoudecheng789@163.com\nEmail:zyyang@nwu.edu.cn\n\n\f2\nnumbers l has been obtained in [14]. Liu [15] studied the electromagnetic perturbations of\nblack holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity.\nFor Gauss-Bonnet gravity, it is interesting to explore some rotating black holes. However\nsince the equations of motion are highly nonlinear, it is rather hard to obtain the exact\nanalytic rotating black hole solutions. By introducing a small angular momentum as a\nperturbation into a non-rotating system, Kim and Cai [16] studied slowly Gauss-Bonnet\nrotating black hole solutions with one nonvanishing angular momentum. It is worth to\nmention that the Lagrangian of Gauss-Bonnet action only involves three terms constituted\nby the contracted product of Ricci curvature and the Riemann curvature tensors. While,\nthe resulting field equations, obtained after variation with respect to the metric tensor, have\nseven terms. If considering a higher order Lovelock gravity, the resulting field equation\nfor third order Lovelock gravity contains thirty-four terms [17, 18]. Therefore, taking into\naccount all the relevant terms of the Lovelock action, obtaining slowly rotating black hole\nsolutions by solving the field equations in high dimensions is a very complicated task. Note\nthat the exact static Gauss-Bonnet black hole solutions were obtained by working directly\nin the action in [2, 8, 9]. In this paper, we dedicate to investigate the slowly rotating black\nhole solutions in Gauss-Bonnet gravity following the method. Apparently the lowest level\ncontribution of rotation should be proportional to a2 . Hence, linearly dependent on a, the\nmetric demonstrated in [16] is not applicable in this case. So, we need to find a proper\nmetric ansatz up to a2 .\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present a new form metric and obtain\nslowly rotating black hole solutions by working directly in the action. Section 3 is devoted\nto a summary of the results.\n\nII.\n\nSLOWLY ROTATING GAUSS-BONNET BLACK HOLES IN FIVE\nDIMENSIONS\n\nIn this section, we analyze the slowly rotating Gauss-Bonnet black holes in five dimensional spacetimes. In order to explore slowly rotating black holes by working directly in the\n\n\f3\naction, the new metric describing rotating black holes is expressed as\nh\na2 (cos2 \u03b8f (r) \u2212 1)\na2 i 2\na2 a2 (1 \u2212 f (r)) cos2 \u03b8 i 2 h 1\ndt\n+\n+\n\u2212\ndr\nds2 = \u2212 f (r) + 2 +\nl\nr2\nf (r)\nr 2 f (r)2\nl2 f (r)2\nh\n\u0001\na2 r 2\n+ (r 2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8 + 2 cos2 \u03b8)d\u03b82 + r 2 + a2 + a2 1 \u2212 f (r) sin2 \u03b8\nl\n2 i\n2 2\n2a r sin \u03b8\n+\nsin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 + 2ar 2 p(r) sin2 \u03b8dtd\u03c6 + r 2 cos2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ,\n(1)\nl2\nwhere the parameter a is a small quantity and the functions f (r) and p(r) are two independent variables.\nThe action for Gauss-Bonnet theory with negative cosmological constant \u039b = \u22126/l2 in\nfive dimensions is given by [9]\n1\nI =\n16\u03c0G\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd5 x \u2212g(\u22122\u039b + R + \u03b1L2 ),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient with dimension (length)2 and is positive in the\nheterotic string theory. The second term R is the Einstein-Hilbert term and the third order\nterm is the Gauss-Bonnet term\nL2 = R\u03b3\u03b4\u03bb\u03c3 R\u03b3\u03b4\u03bb\u03c3 \u2212 4R\u03b3\u03b4 R\u03b3\u03b4 + R2 .\n\n(3)\n\nWe also notice that the Lagrangian of Lovelock gravity is the sum of dimensionally extended\nEuler densities [19]\nL=\n\nm\nX\nn=0\n\n\u03b1n L n ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b1n is an arbitrary constant and Ln is the Euler density of a 2n-dimensional manifold:\nLn =\n\n1 a1 b1 ***an bn c1 d1\n\u03b4c1 b1 ***cn dn R a1 b1 * * * Rcn dnan bn .\nn\n2\n\n(5)\n\nHere the generalized delta function is totally antisymmetric in both sets of indices. Usually,\nwe set L0 = 1 and hence \u03b10 is just the cosmological constant. L1 gives us the usual EinsteinHilbert term and L2 is the Gauss-Bonnet term, and then it reads\n1\nL2 = \u03b4ca11bb11ca22db22 Rc1 d1a1 b1 Rc2 d2a2 b2 .\n4\n\n(6)\n\nIn this paper, we focus on the Lagrangian of Gauss-Bonnet term with Eq. (6), instead of\nthe corresponding one in Eq. (3).\n\n\f4\nIn principle, one can directly put the metric Eq. (1) into the action Eq. (2), and derives\nout the equation of motion for functions f (r) and p(r). But, this will become complicated,\nespecially in higher order Lovelock gravity. Fortunately, what we need is the term proportional to a2 , including the lower terms in action. According to the ansatz of metric, all\nnon-vanishing components of Riemann tensors (up to a2 ) can be classified into three groups:\n(I) diagonal form R\u00ee\u0135 \u00ee\u0135 , (II) off-diagonal form proportional to a and (III) off-diagonal form\nproportional to a2 . Some of key steps are given in appendixes. For group (I), the elements\nread\nR1212 = R\u03041212 + R\u03031212 ,\n\nR1i 1i = R\u03041i 1i + R\u03031i 1i ,\n\nR2i 2i = R\u03042i 2i + R\u03032i 2i ,\n\nRij ij = R\u0304ij ij + R\u0303ij ij .\n\n(7)\n\nwhere 3 \u2264 i < j \u2264 5 and the Riemann tensors R\u03041212 , R\u03042i 2i and R\u0304ij ij represent the compo-\n\nnents which are independent on parameter a, while the tensors R\u03031212 , R\u03032i 2i and R\u0303ij ij are\n\nproportional to a2 . Denoted the Lagrangian of Gauss-Bonnet term from the contribution of\nthe case (I) by Ld , it can be written as\nLd = L\u0304d + L\u0303d ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\n1 a1 b1 a2 b2 c1 d1\n\u03b4c1 b1 c2 d2 R\u0304 a1 b1 R\u0304c2 d2a2 b2\n4\n= 24R\u03041212 R\u03043434 + 48R\u03041313 R\u03042424 + 24R\u03041313 R\u03044545 + 24R\u03042323 R\u03044545 ,\n1\nL\u0303d = \u03b4ca11bb11ca22db22 R\u0304c1 d1a1 b1 R\u0303c2 d2a2 b2\n2\n5\nX\n12\n34\n= 24R\u0303 12 \u00d7 R\u0304 34 + 8\nR\u03031i 1i \u00d7 (2R\u03042424 + R\u03044545 )\nL\u0304d =\n\ni=3\n\n+ 8\n\n5\nX\nj=3\n\nR\u03032j2j \u00d7 (2R\u03041414 + R\u03044545 )\n\n+ 8(R\u03033434 + R\u03033535 + R\u03034545 ) \u00d7 (R\u03041212 + R\u03041313 + R\u03042323 ).\n\n(9)\n\nUnlike the static and spherically symmetric metric, there are some off-diagonal Riemann\ntensors. With the help of the properties of Kronecker delta symbol, one can find that the\ncontribution of off-diagonal Riemann tensors in case (III) vanishes. The parts of Lagrangian\nfrom the off-diagonal Riemann tensors in case (II) are obtained\nLod = Lod1 + Lod2 ,\n\n(10)\n\n\f5\nwhere\nLod1 = 4(R1234 R3412 + R1324 R2413 + R1423 R2314 ),\nLod2 = 4(R1224 R3413 + R2412 R1334 + R1224 R5415\n+ R2412 R1554 + R1334 R5415 + R3413 R1554 ).\nFurthermore, the Ricci scalar R is given by\nR = R\u0304 + R\u0303,\nwhere R\u0304 is equal to\n\n6(1\u2212f (r)\u2212rf (r)\u2032 )\n\u2212f (r)\u2032\u2032\nr2\n\n(11)\n\nand R\u0303 is proportional to a2 and given in appendixes.\n\nVarying the action Eq. (2) with regard to the function p(r), we have\n0 = [2\u03b1\u0303f (r)r \u2212 2\u03b1\u0303r \u2212 r 3 ]f (r)p(r)\u2032\u2032 + [6\u03b1\u0303f (r) \u2212 5r 2 + 2\u03b1\u0303rf (r)\u2032 \u2212 6\u03b1\u0303]f (r)p(r)\u2032\n4r 3\n+ 3[\u2212f (r)\u2032 r 2 \u2212 2\u03b1\u0303f (r)\u2032 + 2r + 2\u03b1\u0303f (r)\u2032f (r) \u2212 2f (r)r + 2 ]p(r).\nl\n\n(12)\n\nHere we suppose that the coefficient of function p(r) vanishes, and then easily obtain\nr\n4\u03b1\u0303 4\u03b1\u0303m \u0011\nr2 \u0010\n1\u2212 1\u2212 2 + 4 ,\n(13)\nf (r) = 1 +\n2\u03b1\u0303\nl\nr\nwhere the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient \u03b1 is rescaled to \u03b1\u0303/2 and m is a integral constant. Hence,\nthe Eq. (12) reduces to\n[2\u03b1\u0303f (r)r \u2212 2\u03b1\u0303r \u2212 r 3 ]p(r)\u2032\u2032 + [6\u03b1\u0303f (r) \u2212 5r 2 + 2\u03b1\u0303rf (r)\u2032 \u2212 6\u03b1\u0303]p(r)\u2032 = 0.\nThen, the expression for function p(r) can be written as\nr\nC2\n4\u03b1\u0303 4\u03b1\u0303m\n1 \u2212 2 + 4 + C1 ,\np(r) = \u2212\n8\u03b1\u0303m\nl\nr\nwhere the C1 and C2 are two integration constants. Let C2 = 4m and C1 =\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n1\n,\n2\u03b1\u0303\n\nthe Eq. (15)\n\nbecomes\n1 \u0010\np(r) =\n1\u2212\n2\u03b1\u0303\n\nr\n\n4\u03b1\u0303 4\u03b1\u0303m \u0011\n1\u2212 2 + 4 .\nl\nr\n\n(16)\n\nIn addition, we get another equation for functions f (r) and p(r) by varying the action Eq. (2)\nrespecting to f (r). It is worth to point out that this equation identically equals to zero when\nf (r) and p(r) take the forms Eq. (13) and Eq. (16), respectively.

It is worth to\nnote that the diagonal components of the metric also involve a2 besides the function f (r).\nMoreover, gt\u03c6 is proportional to r 2 p(r) as to make the equation for p(r) much simple. By\ndiscarding any terms involving a3 and higher powers in a in the action, we got the exact\nform for function p(r), while the function f (r) still kept the form of the static solutions. In\naddition, we described the Killing isometries of the metric and presented its mass parameter\nand angular momentum of the black holes.\nThe advantage of this method is avoiding the equations of motion to arrive at the slowly\nrotating black holes solutions. Although we only considered the slowly rotating black holes\nin five dimensional spacetimes, this method is still valid for general Gauss-Bonnet gravity in\nhigher dimension including charge. Furthermore, in general Lovelock gravity, the Einstein\nequation must involve the terms derived from the action of Lovelock gravity, which becomes\nvery hard if n > 3. But, in present case, the key is to find the action, which is possible\nto carry out for slowly rotating and charge cases. Besides, this approach can also be used\n\n\f7\nto find the slowly rotating solutions with involving multiple angular momenta in different\northogonal planes of rotation. We will discuss them elsewhere.\n\nIV.\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nFrom the metric Eq. (1), we obtain some of the intermediate steps of the calculation.\nRiemann tensors.
