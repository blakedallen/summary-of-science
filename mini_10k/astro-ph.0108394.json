The PDS experiment onboard BeppoSAX is the most sensitive instrument ever above 10 keV. Preliminary results on the complete\ncatalogue of AGN observed with it are presented in this paper.\nThe Phoswitch Detector System (PDS; Frontera et al. 1997) - one of the\nfour Narrow Field Instruments on board the Italian-Dutch satellite BeppoSAX\n(Boella et al. 1997) - is an array of four independent NaI(Tl)/CsI(Na) scintillation detectors. With an hexagonal collimated field of view of 1.\u25e6 3, the PDS was\ndesigned to ensure moderate resolution spectroscopy (\u2206E/E \u2264 15% at 60 keV)\nin the energy range between 13 and 200 keV. The accurate control of the instrumental and celestial background (at the level of one tenth of mCrab) and\nthe unprecedented sensitivity are the most outstanding properties of this instrument, whose performances are likely to remain unsurpassed for many years to\ncome.\nIn this paper we describe the state-of-the-art complete catalogue of Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN) observed by the PDS. Thanks to the last minute extension of the operational life of BeppoSAX, one year beyond the originally foreseen\nswitch-off (April 2001), this is still a work in progress.\nIn this paper we consider all the PDS observations of AGN, whose data\nwere publicly available on March 2001, and which yielded a \u22653\u03c3 PDS detection.\nFor the typical exposure time of a BeppoSAX observation (50 ks), this level\ncorresponds to a count rate of about 0.15 s\u22121 , or 1 mCrab.\n1.\n\nAGN spectroscopy above 10 keV\n\nThe main goal of AGN observations above 10 keV is the direct observation of\nthe nuclear emission of absorbed Seyferts1 . Type 2 Seyferts suffer significant\nextinction in the X-ray band, mainly due to photoelectric absorption by cold\nmatter. As long as the absorbing column density, NH , is lower then a few\n1\n\nIn this paper we define as nuclear the region surrounding the supermassive black hole within\na radius of the order of 1 pc, i.e., the putative inner size of the putative molecular torus (see,\ne.g., Guainazzi et al. 2000a)\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nAuthor & Co-author\n\nFigure 1.\nLeft panel: distribution function for the PDS photon\nindex of different classes of AGN. Right panel: Hardness Ratio versus\nratio-to-X-ray power ratio for the whole PDS AGN catalogue\n1024 cm\u22122 , PDS spectra are basically unaffected by absorption, and the intrinsic\nnuclear emission of different flavors of AGN can be directly compared2 .\nThe general astrophysical context of this study is the unification scenario\nfor Seyfert galaxies (Antonucci 1993). If the observational differences between\nabsorbed and unabsorbed AGN are indeed mainly due to the orientation of systems, that otherwise share a common nuclear engine, hard X-ray observations\nshould allow us to observe the emission from the innermost region of the active\nnucleus, overcoming any \"contamination\" from the surrounding environment.\nAny Seyfert type-dependent differences in the hard X-ray properties would undermine one of the basic assumption of the unification scenario.\nIn Figure 1 we show the distribution function of the photon spectral indices\nfor several classes of AGN. PDS spectra have been fit with a simple power-law\nmodel with high-energy cut-off (the latter component being required at a confidence level higher than 99% only in 4 objects). The mean of the distributions for\ntype 1 and type 2 Seyferts are virtually indistinguishable: h\u0393iSy1 = 1.678\u00b10.014\n(\u03c3Sy1 = 0.070), and h\u0393iSy2 = 1.663 \u00b1 0.013 (\u03c3Sy2 = 0.069), respectively.\nFor comparison, we show also the distribution for a the sample of radio-loud\nquasars (radio galaxies and blazars): h\u0393iRG = 1.75 \u00b1 0.04 (\u03c3RG = 0.104), and\nh\u0393iBl = 1.90 \u00b1 0.03 (\u03c3Bl = 0.128), respectively. The difference seems to be\nrelated to the skeweness of the distribution around the maximum value. In\nthe right panel of Figure 1 we compare the PDS hardness ratio [defined as\nHR \u2261 (H \u2212 S)/(H + S), where S and H are the counts below and above\n2\n\nRecent BeppoSAX studies (Risaliti et al. 1999) suggest that a sizable fraction of Seyferts\nare totally thick to Compton-scattering, with NH > 1025 cm\u22122 . In this case the nuclear\ntransmitted flux is strongly suppressed and even the PDS is of very little help.\n\n\fAPS Conf. Ser.

The position of NGC 1052 is marked: it is a LINER,\nwhose X-ray emission is likely to be dominated by an advectiondominated flow (Guainazzi et al. 2000b) Right panel: FIR-to-X-ray\nluminosity ratios versus the X-ray luminosity for the same sample\n30 keV] against the ratio between the 5 Ghz and the 20-200 keV fluxes, Rrx .\nFor Rrx < 10\u22123 , HR is confined within a narrow band around HR = 0, whereas\nAGN with a stronger relative radio power tend to suffer a substantially higher\nscatter of the data points, likely to be due to the dichotomy of physical processes (synchrotron and inverse Compton), dominating the blazar emission in\nthis energy band.\n2.\n\nMultiwavelenght view\n\nThe 20-200 keV luminosity, LX of the PDS Seyferts shows clear correlations\nwith the radio (see the left panel of Figure 2) and the FIR power (Figure 3).\nThe former correlation suggests a common nuclear origin for both components.\nIndeed, at least 50% of the 12\u03bcm Seyfert sample show unresolved radio emission\non the sub-arcsecond scale (Thean et al. 2000). The correlation between LX and\nLF IR is at a significance level higher than 99.9% for all IRAS bands and for both\ntype 1 and type 2 objects, except for the 100\u03bcm band in Seyfert 1s (\u2243 99%). This\nsupports the idea that the bulk of the FIR emission in (bright) Seyferts is due\nto reprocessing by optically-thick matter, e.g. the molecular torus surrounding\nthe active nucleus in the unification scenarios. Some objects exhibit, however,\nan excess of FIR emission in comparison with the members of their class of\ncorresponding X-ray luminosity. Three of these outliners (NGC 1068, NGC 7469,\nand NGC 6240) are well known to host intense nuclear starbursts, which may\nwell explain the IR excess emission in terms of dust heating by young hot stars in\nregions in intense star formation. Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s do not seem to occupy\n\n\f4\n\nAuthor & Co-author\n\nFigure 3.\ncatalogue\n\nFIR versus X-ray correlation for the Seyfert of the PDS\n\nthe same loci in the FIR vs. X-ray plane. As shown in the right panel of Figure\n2, for LX < 1043 erg s\u22121 Seyfert 2s tend to have on the average a higher FIRto-X-ray luminosity ratio than Seyfert 1s, whereas this difference vanishes for\nhigh-luminosity objects. This would point to an increasingly important starburst\ncontribution to the energy budget for decreasing AGN luminosity and increasing\nAGN \"obscureness\". Caution must be, however, used in the interpretation of\nthis result, because the type 1 and 2 samples are not well matched in X-ray\nluminosity.\nThe authors acknowledge stimulating discussions with A.Zezas.\nReferences\nAntonucci R., 1993, ARA&A, 31, 473\nBoella G., et al., 1996, A&AS, 122, 299\nFrontera F., et al., 1997, A&AS, 122, 357\nGuainazzi M., et al., 2000a, NewA, 5, 235\nGuainazzi M., et al., 2000b, A&A, 364, L80\nRisaliti G., Maiolino R., Salvati M., 1999, ApJ, 522, 157\nThean D., et al., 2000, MNRAS, 314, 573\n\n\f"}
