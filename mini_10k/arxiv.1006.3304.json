We provide a survey of past research and a list of open problems\nregarding central simple algebras and the Brauer group over a field, intended\nboth for experts and for beginners.\n\nThere are many accessible introductions to the theory of central simple algebras\nand the Brauer group, such as [Alb61], [Her68], [Pie82], [Dra83], [Row91, Ch. 7],\n[Ker90], [Jac96], and [GS06]-or at a more advanced level, [Sal99]. But there\nhas not been a survey of open problems for a while-the most prominent recent\nreferences are the excellent surveys [Ami82], [Sal84], [Sal92], and [Sal01]. Since the\nlast survey, major new threads have appeared related to geometric techniques. As\nexamples, we mention (in chronological order):\nSaltman's results on division algebras over the function field of a p-adic\ncurve, see [Sal97a], [Sal07], [Bru10], [PS98], [PSar];\nDe Jong's result on the Brauer group of the function field of a complex\nsurface, see [dJ04], [Lie08], and \u00a74;\nHarbater\u2013Hartmann\u2013Krashen patching techniques, see [HHK09] and [HHKar];\nand\nMerkurjev's bounding of essential p-dimension of PGLn , see [Mer10], [Merar],\nand \u00a76.\nMotivated by these and other developments, we now present an updated list\nof open problems. Some of these problems are-or have become-special cases of\nmuch more general problems for algebraic groups. To keep our task manageable,\nwe (mostly) restrict our attention to central simple algebras and PGLn . The following is an idiosyncratic list that originated during the Brauer group conference\nheld at Kibbutz Ketura in January 2010. We thank the participants in that problem session for their contributions to this text.

A ring A is a central simple F -algebra if A\nis a finite dimensional F -vector space, A has center F , and A has no nontrivial\n2-sided ideals. An F -division algebra is a central simple F -algebra with no nontrivial 1-sided ideals. Every central simple F -algebra B is isomorphic to a matrix\nalgebra over a unique F -division algebra (Wedderburn's theorem), which is said\nto be associated with B. Two algebras are said to be (Brauer) equivalent if their\nrespective associated division algebras are F -isomorphic. Thus two algebras A and\nB are equivalent if there exist number n and m such that Mn pAq \u0010 Mm pB q. The\nresulting set of equivalence classes forms the (classical) Brauer group BrpF q, and\nthis set inherits a group structure from the F -tensor product on algebras. The\nindex of a central simple algebra is the degree of its associated division algebra,\nand the period (or exponent ) is the order of its Brauer class.\nRecall that an \u00e9tale F -algebra is a finite product of finite separable field extensions of F . Such an algebra L is Galois with group G if Spec L is a G-torsor\nover F . In other words, L{F is finite and separable, and G acts on L via F automorphisms such that the induced action on HomF -alg. pL, Fsep q is simple and\ntransitive, where Fsep is a separable closure of F . If L{F is G-Galois then there\nexists a subgroup H of G and an H-Galois field extension K {F such that L is Gisomorphic to HomF -v.s. pF rG{H s, K q with the\n\u00b1 induced action and pointwise product. Equivalently, L is G-isomorphic t to G{H pK qsH , where G{H is the coset\nspace. Compare [Mil80, \u00a7I.5].\nDefinition of a crossed product. The classical theory shows that each central\nsimple F -algebra B of degree n contains a commutative \u00e9tale subalgebra T of degree\nn over F , called a maximal torus. Equivalently, there exists an \u00e9tale extension T {F\nof degree n that splits B, i.e., such that B bF T \u0010 Mn pT q. By definition, B is a\ncrossed product if B contains a maximal torus that is Galois over F . Further, B is\ncyclic if B contains a maximal torus that is cyclic Galois over F . It is easy to see\nthat every B is Brauer-equivalent to a crossed product. For if L{F is the Galois\nclosure of a maximal torus T \u0080 B with respect to a separable closure Fsep , and\nrL : T s \u0010 m, then L is a Galois maximal torus of C \u0010 Mm pB q.\nDetermining the crossed product central simple F -algebras B with Brauer-equivalent\ndivision algebra A is equivalent to determining the finite Galois splitting fields of\nA. For B is a G-crossed product via some G-Galois maximal torus L{F if and only\nif A is split by an H-Galois field extension K {F , where H \u00a4 G and K {F where K\nis the image of L under an (any) F -algebra homomorphism from L to Fsep . Thus,\nproblems involving crossed products focus on the Galois splitting fields of division\nalgebras.\n\n\fOPEN PROBLEMS ON CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\nIt follows from the above that if A is a crossed product or is cyclic, then so\nis every B \u0010 Mn pAq. The converse turns out to be false; there exist noncrossed\nproducts, as we shall see below. Moreover, in case F has prime characteristic p,\nAlbert proved that every p-algebra (i.e., central simple algebra of period a power of\np) is Brauer-equivalent to a cyclic algebra. But [AS78] gives an example of a noncyclic p-algebra. One can lift this example to a complete discrete valuation ring of\ncharacteristic 0 and so find a central simple algebra A over a field of characteristic\n0 such that Mn pAq is cyclic for some n but A is not.\nCohomological interpretation. Much of the interest in crossed products stems\nfrom the fact that the Galois structure of a crossed product allows us to describe it\nsimply (see \u00a76) and explicitly. For if B is a crossed product via a G-Galois extension\nK {F , then B's algebra structure is encoded in a Galois 2-cocycle f P Z 2 pG, K \u0002 q,\nwhich is easily extracted from B in principle. Conversely, each f P Z 2 pG, K \u0002 q\ndefines a G-crossed product Bf with maximal subfield K {F , by letting\nBf\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00e0\n\nP\n\nKus\n\ns G\n\nbe a K-vector space on formal basis elements us , and defining multiplication by\nus ut \u0010 f ps, tqust and us x \u0010 spxqus for all s, t P G and x P K. The equivalence relation on central simple algebras induces an equivalence on cocycles, and the resulting\ngroup of equivalence classes is the Galois cohomology group H2 pG, K \u0002 q. Note that\nevery central simple algebra is a crossed product if and only if the correspondence\nbetween classes extends to the level of cocycles and algebras.\nThe crossed product problem for division algebras. Since every algebra\nrepresenting a given class is a crossed product if and only if its associated division\nalgebra is a crossed product, the interesting question is whether every F -division\nalgebra is a crossed product.\nFields over which all division algebras are known to be crossed products include\nthose that do not support division algebras in the first place (fields of cohomological\ndimension less than 2, such as algebraically closed fields and quasi-finite fields),\nthose over which all division algebras are cyclic (global fields and local fields),\nand those over which all division algebras are abelian crossed products (strictly\nhenselian fields [Bru01, Th. 1], at least for algebras of period prime to the residue\ncharacteristic).\nFor much of the 20th century it was reasonable to conjecture that every central\nsimple algebra was itself a crossed product. Then, in 1972, Amitsur produced noncrossed product division algebras of any degree n divisible by 23 or p2 for an odd\nprime p, provided n is prime to the characteristic. The centers of these (universal)\ndivision algebras are given as invariant fields; their precise nature is itself a topic\nof interest (see \u00a75). In [SS73] Schacher and Small extended Amitsur's result to\ninclude the case where the characteristic is positive and does not divide the degree.\nIn [Sal78a], Saltman included the p-algebra case, when n is divisible by p3 . Subsequent constructions of noncrossed products-none improving on the indexes found\nby Amitsur-have since appeared in [Ris77], [Sal78b], [Row81], [Tig86], [JW86],\n[Bru95], [RY01, Th. 1.3], [BMT09], and others. The most explicit construction to\ndate is in [Han05].\nResponding to the sensitivity of Amitsur's degree p2 examples to the ground\nfield's characteristic and roots of unity, Saltman and Rowen observed that every\n\n\f4\n\nASHER AUEL, ERIC BRUSSEL, SKIP GARIBALDI, AND UZI VISHNE\n\ndivision algebra of degree p2 becomes a crossed product on some prime-to-p extension (the degree p case being trivial), whereas for degree p3 and above, examples\nexist that are stable under such extensions ([RS92]); see [McK07, Cor. 2.2.2] for\nthe p-algebra case.\n1. Non-cyclic algebras in prime degree\nPerhaps the most important open problem in the theory of central simple algebras is:\nProblem 1.1. Given a prime p, construct a non-cyclic division algebra of degree\np over some field F .\nThis was listed as Problem 7 in Amitsur's survey [Ami82], and Problem 1 in\n[Sal92]. Of course, division algebras of non-prime degree need not be cyclic. This\nis true already in the smallest possible case of degree 4 ([Alb33]).\nWhat is known. Prime-degree division algebras for the two smallest primes are\nalways cyclic: The p \u0010 2 case is elementary, and the p \u0010 3 case was solved by\nWedderburn in 1921 ([Wed21]). A result that should be included with these two is\nthat any division algebra of degree n \u0010 4 is a crossed product ([Alb61]). In 1938,\nBrauer proved that any division algebra of degree p \u0010 5 has a (solvable) Galois\nsplitting field of degree dividing 60 ([Bra38]); this result was improved somewhat in\n[RS96]. Despite the promising start, this vexing problem remains completely open\nfor p \u00a1 3. Specific candidates for prime degree non-crossed products have been\nproposed in [Row99, \u00a74] and [Vis04, p. 487].\nIt is natural to specialize the problem to fields with known properties. For some\nfields F , one knows that every division algebra of degree p is cyclic: when F has no\nseparable extensions of degree p (trivial case), when F is a local field or a global field\n(by Albert\u2013Brauer\u2013Hasse\u2013Noether), and when F is the function field of a l-adic\ncurve for l prime and different from p [Sal07].\nGeneralization. In 1934, Albert proved that an F -division algebra A of prime\ndegree p is a crossed product if and only if A contains a non-central element x such\nthat xp is in F , called a p-central element (\"Albert's cyclicity criterion\", [Alb61,\nXI, Th. 4.4]). It is natural to ask whether such elements exist in algebras of degree\ngreater than p. When p \u0010 2, the degree is 4, and the characteristic is not 2, Albert's\ncrossed product result shows that they do exist. On the other hand, it is shown in\n[AS78] that there exist algebras of degree p2 and characteristic p with no p-central\nelements. Using this, it is shown in [Sal80] that for n a multiple of p2 , the universal\ndivision algebra of degree n over the rational field Q has no p-central elements.\nWhen F has a primitive p-th root of unity, there are no known examples of division\nF -algebras of degree a multiple of p that do not have p-central elements.\n2. Other problems regarding crossed products\nThe central organizing problem in the theory of central simple algebras and the\nBrauer group is to determine, possibly for a given field F , the extent to which\nF -central simple algebras are crossed products, and in particular, cyclic crossed\nproducts. There are still some important unresolved problems in addition to Problem 1.1.\n\n\fOPEN PROBLEMS ON CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\nProblem 2.1. Determine whether F -division algebras of prime period are crossed\nproducts.\nBoth Problems 1.1 and 2.1 are related to the problem of computing the essential\ndimension of algebraic groups described in \u00a76.\nWhat is known. This problem is even more open than Problem 1.1, in the sense\nthat no noncrossed products of prime period have ever been discovered, and no\none has shown that all division algebras of a fixed prime period must be crossed\nproducts. For odd primes p the problem is completely open. (The proof of Theorem\n6 in [Row82] concerning the existence of noncrossed products of prime period is\nincorrect. In the modified version that appeared later as [Row88, Th. 7.3.31], the\nflaw appears in the last paragraphs of page 255.)\nDivision algebras of pperiod, indexq \u0010 p2, 2n q are known to be crossed products\nfor n \u00a4 3, and the problem for n \u00a1 3 is open. Albert proved the p2, 4q case (\"Albert's\nTheorem\") in [Alb32, Th. 6]-see alternatively [Jac96, 5.6.9]-and in a second proof\n[Alb33], he showed that such algebras need not be cyclic. Rowen proved the p2, 8q\ncase for any field in [Row78] and [Row84], see also [Jac96, 5.6.10]. Rowen [Row81]\nand later Tignol [Tig86] proved that Saltman's universal division algebra of type\np4, 8q is a noncrossed product.\nRegarding specific fields, Brussel and Tengan recently proved that division algebras of type pp, p2 q for p \u0018 l over the function field of an l-adic curve are crossed\nproducts in [BT10] (cf. Saltman's results on these fields, mentioned in the previous\nsection).\nAs mentioned above, the smallest non-crossed product p-algebras known have\ndegree p3 . Therefore even the following is open:\nProblem 2.2. Determine whether p-algebras of degree p2 are crossed products.\nIn view of the fact that all known examples of non-crossed product algebras\noccur over fields of cohomological dimension at least 3, it is natural to ask:\nProblem 2.3. If F has cohomological dimension at most 2, is every central simple\nF -algebra a crossed product?\nThe answer to this question is unknown, even when F is the function field of a\ncomplex surface.\nSmallest Galois splitting fields. One way to study the failure of a division\nalgebra to be a crossed product is to determine, for a given division algebra A, the\nsmallest Brauer-equivalent crossed product(s) B \u0010 Mr pAq. As noted already, it is\nequivalent to determine the finite Galois splitting fields for A. As Brauer\u2013Hasse\u2013\nNoether knew in the 1920's, \"minimal\" Galois splitting fields can have arbitrarily\nlarge degree (Roquette cites [BN27] and [Has27] in [Roq04, Chap. 7.1]), so it is\nimportant to specify that the degree (rather than the splitting field) be minimal.\nTo simplify the exposition, we say a finite group G splits a central simple F algebra A if there exists a G-Galois field extension of F that splits A (equivalently,\nif some Mm pAq is a G-crossed product). Since a splitting field of A may or may\nnot contain a maximal subfield of A, the problem with respect to division algebras\ndivides into parts.\nProblem 2.4. Determine the smallest splitting group(s) of an F -division algebra A\narising from the Galois closure of a maximal subfield of A. Determine in particular\n\n\f6\n\nASHER AUEL, ERIC BRUSSEL, SKIP GARIBALDI, AND UZI VISHNE\n\nwhether every A of degree n has a separable maximal subfield whose Galois closure\nhas group the alternating group An .\nProblem 2.5. Determine whether every division algebra is split by an abelian\ngroup, and find degree bounds over specific fields.\nWhat is known. Both problems are related to Problem 5 in [Ami82], and Problem 2.5 is Question 1 in [Ami82]. In the situation where A is a crossed product,\nProblem 2.4 becomes a problem of group admissibility. It then has a strong number\nand group-theoretic character, and we put it in Problem 11.1 below.\nIf A has degree n, then A contains a maximal separable subfield (of degree n)\nthat is contained in an Sn -Galois maximal torus, which bounds the answer to the\nfirst part of Problem 2.4 from above. It is clear that these are in general not hard\nbounds, since if n \u0010 3 then C3 splits A by Wedderburn's results. It is unknown\nwhether there exists a (noncrossed product) division algebra of degree n \u00a1 4 that\nis split by no proper subgroup of Sn , prompting Amitsur to ask Problem 2.4.\nWith the additional structure provided by an involution of the first kind, some\npositive results for Problem 2.4 can be proved in the period 2 case, for char F \u0018 2.\nIn particular, if A has period 2 and 2-power degree 2m, one can prove the existence\nof a subfield of degree m in a maximal separable subfield of A, and it follows that\nthe Galois closure has group H \u0010 C2m Sm . Using the main result of Parimala\u2013\nSridharan\u2013Suresh in [PSS93], one can improve this to H\u0304 \u0010 C2m\u00011 Sm ; we leave\nthe details to the interested reader. Note that H is not contained in A2m , but H\u0304\nis.\nAmitsur proved that if the universal division algebra (defined in \u00a75 below)\nUDpk, nq over an infinite field k is split by a group G, then every division algebra over a field F containing k is split by (a subgroup of) G (unpublished, see\n[Ami82, p.15] and [TA85, 7.1]). Thus Problem 2.5 is intimately connected to the\nproblem of splitting the universal division algebra, which is Problem 8 in [Ami82].\nIn [Ami82] Amitsur remarked that if n is the composite of r relatively prime numbers ni , then Sn1 \u0002 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 \u0002 Snr splits UDpk, nq. Then in [TA85, Th. 7.3] Tignol and\nAmitsur established a remarkable lower bound on the order of a splitting group of\nUDpk, nq, for infinite k, and n not divisible by char k. See [TA86, Cor. 9.4] and\n[RY01, Th. 1.3] for improvements and alternative proofs of this bound in the case\nwhere n is a prime power.\nIf char F does not divide the period n of an F -division algebra A, the Merkurjev\u2013\nSuslin theorem shows that A has a meta-abelian splitting field, obtained by adjoining n-th roots of unity, if necessary, and then a Kummer extension. This theorem\nsolved Amitsur's Question 3 in [Ami82], and it solves the first part of Problem 2.5\nif F contains the n-th roots of unity. Results bounding the \"symbol length\" over\na particular field provide upper bounds for the degree of abelian (or meta-abelian)\nGalois splitting fields, and for this we refer to Problem 3.5. Tignol and Amitsur\nsubmitted a lower bound for the order of an abelian splitting group in [TA85, 7.5].\nWhen F does not contain n-th roots of unity, Problem 2.5 has a similar relationship to the more general open problem of determining whether the Brauer\ngroup is generated by cyclic classes, and for this we refer to \u00a73. This latter problem\nwas Question 2 in [Ami82]. The problem is settled for the 2-, 3-, and 5-torsion\nsubgroups of BrpF q.\n\n\fOPEN PROBLEMS ON CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS\n\n7\n\np-algebras. Somewhat more is known about Problem 2.5 for p-algebras: If char F \u0010\np and A is an F -division algebra of p-power degree, then Albert showed that A has\na cyclic splitting field in [Alb36], see also [Alb61, Ch. VII, Th. 9.31]. Louis Isaac\nGordon proved the existence of noncyclic 2-algebras (of period and index 4) in\n[Gor40] and Amitsur and Saltman proved the existence of (generic) non-cyclic division p-algebras of every degree pn (n \u00a5 2) in [AS78]. These results raised questions\nabout bounds of cyclic splitting fields.\nAlbert's methods impose such bounds on p-algebras A with fixed (p-power) period q, provided F is finitely generated of transcendence degree r over a perfect field\nk. For then F 1{q splits A by [Alb61, VII.7, Theorem 2], and since rF 1{q : F s \u0010 q r\n([Bou88a, A.V.100, Proposition 4] and [Bou88a, A.V.135, Corollary 3]), A is similar\nto a tensor product of r cyclic p-algebras of degree q by [Alb61, VII.9, Theorem\n28], hence A is split by a cyclic extension of degree q r , by [Alb61, VII.9, Lemma\n13]. The center Z pk, nq of generic degree-n matrices over a field k is known to be\nfinitely generated ([Sal99, Cor. 14.9]); if k is a finite field of characteristic p, and\nZ pk, nq has transcendence degree m over k, then it follows that the universal division algebra UDpk, pn q is split by a cyclic field extension of degree pmn , and hence\nfor any field F containing k, any F -division algebra A of degree pn is split by a\ncyclic \u00e9tale extension of degree pmn over F , by [Ami82, p.15].\nBecause of this connection between the degree of a cyclic splitting field of a\np-algebra and the transcendence degree of the center of generic matrices over the\nprime field, Problem 2.5 for p-algebras is closely tied to \u00a76 on essential dimension.\nAs for known bounds, we have m \u00a4 p2n 1 from general principles, and if p is odd\nand pn \u00a5 5, then m \u00a4 p1{2qppn \u0001 1qppn \u0001 2q by [LRRS03]. (Note the pn \u0010 2, 3 cases\nare settled by Wedderburn's cyclicity results.)\nDescending from prime-to-p extensions. Since every division algebra has a\nmaximal separable subfield, every division algebra of prime degree p is a crossed\nproduct after scalar extension to a prime-to-p field extension. This has led to some\nattempts at \"descent\": If A is an F -division algebra of prime degree p, and K {F is\na Galois splitting field for A whose group G is a semidirect product G \u0010 Cp H\nwith Cp normal in G and H of order m prime-to-p, then A bF K Cp is a Cp -crossed\nproduct division algebra, and we can ask whether the Galois structure descends to\nA. This idea goes back to Albert ([Alb38]). In the particularly interesting case\nwhere H \u0010 Cm and K Cp \u0010 F p\u03b6p q for a primitive p-th root of unity \u03b6p , we call A a\nquasi-symbol, after [Vis04]. Note in this case char F \u0018 p.\nThe problem below is strongly related to Problems 3, 4, and 5 in [Sal92]. As\nSaltman noted in [Sal92], showing such crossed products are cyclic is equivalent to\nshowing that the G-crossed product Mm pAq is also a G1 -crossed product, where G1\nis a group that has Cp as an image. As in [TA85], write G \u00f1 G1 if every G-crossed\nproduct is necessarily a G1 -crossed product, and G \u00f1F G1 if G \u00f1 G1 for G-crossed\nproducts whose centers contain F .\nProblem 2.6. Determine groups G and G1 and conditions on F under which\nG \u00f1F G1 . In particular:\n(1) Determine, for m prime-to-p, whether Cp Cm \u00f1F Cp \u0002 Cm .\n(2) Determine whether all quasi-symbols are cyclic.\nWhat is known. Background on the first part of Problem 2.6, as well as a basic\nsymmetry result for abelian groups, may be found in [TA85]. We will say that a\n\n\f8\n\nASHER AUEL, ERIC BRUSSEL, SKIP GARIBALDI, AND UZI VISHNE\n\nfinite group G splits an F -algebra A if A is split by a G-Galois extension of F . Note\nthat in 2.6(1), Cp Cm \u00f1F Cp \u0002 Cm if and only if all F -algebras A of prime degree\np that are split by Cp Cm are cyclic.\nIn 1938 Albert showed that if char F \u0010 p, and A is a p-algebra of degree p\nsplit by a Galois extension whose group is of the form Cp Cm for m prime-to-p,\nthen A is cyclic ([Alb38]), hence Cp Cm \u00f1F Cp \u0002 Cm in this case. He actually\nproved more generally that for p dividing n and arbitrary m, any Cn Cm -crossed\nproduct is abelian, again for char F \u0010 p (see [AJ09] for a different proof). In 1999\nRowen proved that if A is a p-algebra of odd degree p that becomes equivalent to\na certain type (\"Type A\") of p-symbol over a quadratic extension E {F , then A is\nalready cyclic over F ([Row99, Th. 3.4]). This generalized Wedderburn's degree\n3 theorem (in characteristic 3) and proved the cyclicity of a certain p-algebra of\ndegree p studied by Albert. Rowen constructed a generic p-algebra of degree p that\nbecomes a symbol over a quadratic extension, and conjectured it to be noncyclic\nfor p \u00a1 3 ([Row99, \u00a74]).\nIn 1982, Rowen and Saltman showed that if n is odd, F contains a primitive\nn-th root of unity, (so char F does not divide n), and A is a division algebra of\ndegree n that is split by the dihedral group Dn \u0010 Cn C2 of order 2n, then A is\ncyclic ([RS82]). Thus Dn \u00f1F Cn \u0002 C2 in this case. Their techniques generalized\nthose used by Albert to prove cyclicity in degree three, in [Alb61]. Mammone and\nTignol proved the same result using different methods in [MT87], and Haile gave\nanother proof in [Hai94]. In 1996, Haile, Knus, Rost, and Tignol proved that when\nchar F \u0018 2, n is odd, and \u03bcn \u0010 Z{nptq for some t P F \u0002 , then any F -division\nalgebra of degree n split by Dn is cyclic ([HKRT96, Cor. 30]). Vishne proved this\nmore generally for n odd and rF p\u03bcn q : F s \u00a4 2, while removing the restrictions on\nchar F ([Vis04, Th. 13.6]). In the n \u0010 5 case, Matzri showed how to adapt Rowen\nand Saltman's proof to remove the roots of unity and characteristic hypotheses\n([Mat08]), before using results of [Vis04] to prove that 5BrpF q is generated by\ncyclic classes when char F \u0018 5.\nIn 1983 Merkurjev, in a paper that heavily influenced [Vis04] and [Mat08], proved\na criterion for quasi-symbols of prime degree to be cyclic. To state this result, we\nfix some notation and hypotheses. Let p be a prime, n \u0010 pr , \u03b6n a primitive nth root of unity, E \u0010 F p\u03b6p q, \u03bd : GalpE {F q \u00d1 pZ{pq\u0002 the canonical map, and\n\u03c6 : GalpE {F q \u00d1 pZ{pq\u0002 a character. Then consider the hypothesis\n(2.7)\n\n\u03b6n\n\nP E and K {F is a Cn\n\n\u03c6\n\nCm -Galois extension, with E\n\n\u0010 KC\n\nn\n\n.\n\nIn this notation, a quasi-symbol of degree p split by K is said to be of type p\u03c6, \u03c61 q,\nwhere \u03c61 \u0010 \u03bd\u03c6\u00011 . Merkurjev's criterion is that a quasi-symbol of degree n \u0010 p is\ncyclic if and only if it is of type p\u03bd, 1q or p1, \u03bd q ([Mer83]). Vishne, expanding on\nMerkurjev's framework, proved that Merkurjev's cyclicity criterion holds for quasisymbols of degrees n \u0010 pr under (2.7), and constructed a generic quasi-symbol,\nwhich he conjectured to be noncyclic. He also proved that the type of a quasisymbol (of degree n \u0010 pr ) is symmetric in \u03c6 and \u03c61 , so that a quasi-symbol split\nby Cn \u03c6 Cm is also split by Cn \u03c61 Cm .\nIn 1996 Rowen and Saltman proved that if F contains a p-th root of unity, and\nA is a division algebra of degree p that is split by the semidirect product Cp Cm\nfor m \u0010 2, 3, 4, or 6 and dividing p \u0001 1, then A is cyclic. Thus Cp Cm \u00f1F Cp \u0002 Cm\nin this case. Vishne extended this result for quasi-symbols of degree n \u0010 pr under\n(2.7), for any m dividing p \u0001 1 ([Vis04]).\n\n\fOPEN PROBLEMS ON CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS\n\n9\n\nIf m divides n and F contains the m-th roots of unity, then it is elementary to\nshow Cn \u00f1F Cn{m \u0002 Cm (see [Vis03] for proof). This is best possible, since there\nare division algebras D{F where the absolute Galois group of F is rank 2 abelian.\nAs for p-algebras, Saltman proved in [Sal77] that if char F \u0010 p and n is a power\nof p, then Cn \u00f1F G for any group G of order n. Finally, Vishne proved in [Vis03]\nthat if char F does not divide n and F contains the n{m-th roots of unity, then\nDn \u00f1F Dm \u0002 Cn{m holds for classes of period 2 ([Vis03]).\nWe say a group G is rigid (resp. rigid over F ) if there exists a central simple\nalgebra (resp. over F ) that is a crossed product with respect to G and G only.\nA central simple algebra can be a crossed product with respect to many different\ngroups; Schacher showed in [Sch68] that for any number n there exists a number field\nF and a central simple F -algebra A that is a crossed product with respect to every\ngroup of order n (see Problem 11.1). At the other extreme, it is obvious that cyclic\ngroups of prime order are rigid. Amitsur ([Ami72]) proved that elementary abelian\ngroups are rigid, and used this fact in his proof that the generic division algebra is\nnot a crossed product. Saltman and Amitsur\u2013Tignol proved every noncyclic abelian\ngroup is rigid in [Sal78a] and [TA85]. For a time there were no known nonabelian\nrigid groups, and their existence is Problem 4 in [Sal92]. However in 1995 Brussel\ngave examples of rigid nonabelian groups over the fields Qptq, proving that for every\nprime p the group\nG \u0010 Cp2\n\nCp\n\n\u0010 tx, y | |x| \u0010 p2 , |y| \u0010 p,\n\nyxy \u00011\n\n\u0010 xp 1 u\n\nis rigid ([Bru95]), and later that when p is odd, another semidirect product G \u0010\nCp3 Cp is rigid ([Bru96]). All of Brussel's examples depend on the absence of\nroots of unity in the ground field, and it is unknown whether the same results hold\nwithout this assumption. A rigid group of type Cp Cm with m prime-to-p would\nsettle Problem 1.1.\nFootnote. In the end, the goal of the problems described in this section is to\ndetermine the nature of Galois splitting fields of smallest degree for cohomology\nclasses of various kinds. But from an algebra-theoretic point of view, the importance\nof the crossed product problem is due at least partly to a long history of attempted\nsolutions, together with a sentiment expressed by A.A. Albert, who spent much of\nhis career studying it.\nThe importance of crossed products is due not merely to the fact\nthat up to the present they are the only [central] simple algebras\nwhich have actually been constructed but also to Theorem 1: Every\n[central] simple algebra is similar to a crossed product. - Albert,\n1939 [Alb61, \u00a7V.3]\n3. Generation by cyclic algebras\nBy far the most elementary central simple algebras known are the cyclic algebras,\nwhich were the first to be studied, and which to this day have provided an indispensable tool for investigating central simple algebras and the Brauer group. Certainly\nthe simplest expression of a Brauer class that one could hope for would be as a\nsum of classes of cyclic algebras, and in fact most (if not all) known descriptions\nof the Brauer group are direct sum decompositions into subgroups consisting of\ncyclic classes (or cyclic factors). For example, by Auslander\u2013Brumer and Fadeev's\ntheorem (see [GMS03, Theorem 9.2]), the Brauer group of a rational function field\n\n\f10\n\nASHER AUEL, ERIC BRUSSEL, SKIP GARIBALDI, AND UZI VISHNE\n\nin one variable is a direct sum of (corestrictions of) cyclic factors. Also, many\nvaluation-theoretic results on noncrossed products and indecomposable algebras\nrely on Witt's theorem (see [GMS03, 7.9]), which presents the Brauer group of a\ncomplete discretely valued field of rank one as a direct sum of two cyclic factors.\nFor these reasons, one of the most important practical problems in the study of\nthe Brauer group is to determine whether or not the Brauer group is generated\nby the classes of cyclic algebras. This appears as Question 2 in [Ami82]. Authors who studied this problem in the 1930's in one form or another include Albert\n([Alb36]), Teichm\u00fcller ([Tei36]), Nakayama ([Nak38]), and Witt ([Wit37]). For local and global fields, the question has an affirmative answer by the well-known\ntheorems of Hasse and Albert\u2013Brauer\u2013Hasse\u2013Noether, respectively. There are no\nknown counterexamples.\nAfter Amitsur's work on noncrossed products, an affirmative answer for general\nF might well have seemed unlikely. But in a seminal breakthrough, Merkurjev\nand Suslin proved in 1983 that if F contains the n-th roots of unity, then nBrpF q\nis generated by the classes of (cyclic) symbol algebras of degree n, via the norm\nresidue homomorphism in K-theory ([MS83]). The essence of their result was that\nwhen F contains the n-th roots of unity, the composition\n2\n2\nH1 pF, \u03bcn q b H1 pF, \u03bcn q \u00d1 H2 pF, \u03bcb\nn q \u00d1 H pF, \u03bcn q \u0010 nBrpF q\n\nis surjective, where the first map is the cup product, and the second map is cup\nbp\u00011q q \u0010 Homp\u03bc , Z{nq. Thus BrpF q\nproduct with a chosen generator of H0 pF, \u03bcn\nn\nn\nis \"generated in degree one\". This work strongly suggests the following natural\nquestion, which was posed in the 1930's by Albert:\nProblem 3.1. [Alb36, p. 126] Is the n-torsion subgroup nBrpF q generated by the\nclasses of cyclic algebras of degree (dividing) n?\n\nProblem 3.1 has an affirmative answer in the following important cases:\n(1) n is a power of the characteristic of F . This follows from [Alb61, VII.7,\nTheorem 2] and [Alb61, VII.9, Theorem 28].\n(2) n divides 30. By the divisibility remark above, it suffices to note that the\nanswer is \"yes\" for n \u0010 2 [Mer81], n \u0010 3 by [Mer83], and n \u0010 5 by [Mat08].\n(3) n is prime and adjoining a primitive n-th root unity yields an extension of\ndegree \u00a4 3 by [Mer83]. This leads to the results summarized in the previous\nitem.\n(4) F contains a primitive n-th root of unity. This was pointed out above.\nThe Merkurjev-Suslin theorem, which establishes an isomorphism between\n2\nK2M pF q{nK2M pF q and H2 pF, \u03bcb\nn q, is now a special case of the recentlyproved Bloch\u2013Kato Conjecture.\nThe smallest open case for n prime is therefore:\n\nProblem 3.2. Is 7BrpF q generated by cyclic algebras of degree 7 when char F\nand F does not contain a primitive 7-th root of unity?\n\n\u00187\n\n(These problems are related to the following very special question stated by\nM. Mahdavi-Hezavehi: If the multiplicative group F \u0002 is divisible, does it follow\nthat BrpF q is zero? The answer is \"yes\" if BrpF q is generated by cyclic algebras,\nbecause cyclic algebras are split over such a field. Therefore the answer is also \"yes\"\nif F has characteristic zero, because in that case F has all the roots of unity so the\nMerkurjev\u2013Suslin theorem applies.)\n\n\fOPEN PROBLEMS ON CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS\n\n11\n\nFor composite n, even the following is unclear:\nProblem\n? 3.3. Is 4BrpF q generated by cyclic algebras of degree 4 when char F\nand \u00011 R F ?\n\n\u00182\n\nAnd one can ask the weaker question:\nProblem 3.4. Is nBrpF q generated by algebras of degree n?\nWhen n is prime, the answer to Problem 3.4 is \"yes\" by [Mer83]. More generally,\nMerkurjev proved in [Mer86] that if n is a ?\npower of an odd prime p not equal\nto char F , or if n is a power of 2 \u0010: p and \u00011 P F , then nBrpF q is generated\nby quasi-symbols (see \u00a72.6) whose index is bounded by nn{p . This result reduces\nProblem 3.1 to the determination of whether classes of quasi-symbols are generated\nby cyclic classes. Problem 3.4 is already open in the case n \u0010 4.\nSymbol length. Once it is known that nBrpF q is generated by classes of cyclic\nalgebras, the focus turns to the the minimal number of cyclic algebras (of fixed\ndegree) needed to represent it in the Brauer group.\nSuppose m and n have the same prime factors, m \u0017 n, and mBrpF q is generated\nby cyclic algebras. Let lF pm, nq denote the minimal number such that every central\nsimple F -algebra of degree n and period (dividing) m is similar to a tensor product\nof lF pm, nq cyclic algebras of degree m, unless no such bound exists, in which case\nset lF pm, nq \u0010 8. If F contains the m-th roots of unity, the generic division algebra\ncan be used to show that lF pm, nq is finite, by the Merkurjev\u2013Suslin theorem. In\nthis case, we may assume m is a power of a prime p by [Tig84, Th. 2.2], and lF pm, nq\nis known as the symbol length.\nProblem 3.5. Suppose p is a prime, r\nalgebras. Compute lF ppr , ps q.\n\n\u00a4 s, and p BrpF q is generated by cyclic\nr\n\nBasic background on this problem can be found in [Tig84]. Almost all of the\nknown results for lF pm, nq are either for p-algebras, or fields F containing the m-th\nroots of unity. Of course, lF pp, pq \u0010 1 for p \u0010 2, 3 by the classical theory, for any\nfield F . Albert's theorem shows that lF p2, 4q \u0010 2, and lF p2, 8q \u0010 4 when char F \u0018 2\nby [Tig84, Th. 2.6]. For proofs of these and other results that follow more or less\nimmediately from earlier work, see [Tig84]. In 1937, Teichm\u00fcller proved that for\np-algebras, lF ppr , ps q \u00a4 ps ! pps ! \u0001 1q ([Tei37]).\nLower bounds can be obtained via results on indecomposable algebras, which\nwe treat in \u00a79. In [Tig84, Th. 2.3], Tignol proved that if p is a prime and F is a\nfield containing the pr -th roots of unity, then lF ppr , ps q \u00a5 s, by showing that the\ngeneric division algebra itself cannot be represented as a sum of fewer than s classes\nof cyclic algebras of degree pr . Tignol's lower bounds were improved by Jacob in\n[Jac91] in the prime period case, via the construction of indecomposable algebras\nof period p and index pn for all n \u00a5 1, except, of course, for p \u0010 2 and n \u0010 2. His\nbounds, valid for F containing a primitive p-th root of unity, are lF pp, ps q \u00a5 2s \u0001 1\nfor p odd, and lF p2, 2s q \u00a5 2s \u0001 2 ([Jac91, Remark 3.7]).\nFor upper bounds, we have then lF pp, pq \u00a4 12 pp\u00011q! for any odd prime p, provided\nF contains the p-th roots of unity, by [Row88, Th. 7.2.43]. Kahn established some\nupper bounds for lF p2, 2s q in [Kah00, Th. 1] for fields of characteristic not 2, and\nconjectured the bound lF p2, 2s q \u00a4 2s\u00011 , which holds in the known cases listed\nabove. Finally, Becher and Hoffmann proved that if F contains a p-th root of\n\n\f12\n\nASHER AUEL, ERIC BRUSSEL, SKIP GARIBALDI, AND UZI VISHNE\n\nunity and satisfies the (admittedly strong) hypothesis rF \u0002 : F \u0002p s \u0010 pm , then\nlF pp, ps q \u0010 m{2 for p odd or p \u0010 2 and F non-real. If p \u0010 2 and F is real, the\nresult is pm 1q{2 ([BH04]).\nIn a related result, Mammone and Merkurjev showed that if A is a p-algebra\nof period pr and degree ps , and A becomes cyclic over a finite separable field\nextension, then A can be represented by at most ps\u0001r classes of cyclic algebras\n([MM91, Prop. 5]).\nIn [Sal97a], Saltman proved that if F is the function field of an l-adic curve, then\nthe degree of any F -division algebra divides the square of its period, and it follows\nby Albert's theorem that if l \u0018 2, then lF p2, 4q \u0010 2. If l \u0018 p and F contains the p-th\nroots of unity, then Suresh proved that lF pp, p2 q \u0010 2 for odd p in [Sur10]. Brussel\nand Tengan removed the roots of unity requirement in [BT10], using a different\nmethod. The bounds in the p \u0010 2 case were crucial to the determination of the\nu-invariant of function fields of l-adic curves by Parimala\u2013Suresh [PSar], see also\n[PS98] and [PS05].\nThe first open case of Problem 3.5 (with or without roots of unity) is:\nProblem 3.6. Find an upper bound on lF pp, p2 q and lF pp2 , p2 q for p \u00a5 3.\n4. Period-index problem\nBy the basic theory, the period of a central simple algebra divides its index (i.e.,\nperpAq | indpAq for all A), and the two numbers have the same prime factors. For\na field F , define the Brauer dimension Br.dimpF q to be the smallest number n\nsuch that indpAq divides perpAqn for every central simple F -algebra A; if no such\nn exists, set Br.dimpF q \u0010 8.\n\nExample 4.1. If Br F \u0010 0, then trivially Br.dimpF q \u0010 0. For F a local field\nor a global field Br.dimpF q \u0010 1 by Albert\u2013Brauer\u2013Hasse\u2013Noether. For F a field\nfinitely generated and of transcendence degree 2 over an algebraically closed field,\nBr.dimpF q \u0010 1 by [dJ04] and [Lie08, Th. 4.2.2.3]. In case Br.dimpF q \u0010 1, one says\nthat \"F has period \u0010 index\".\nOne can focus this notion on a particular prime p. Define Br.dimp pF q to be the\nsmallest number n such that indpAq divides perpAqn for every central simple F algebra A whose index is a power of p. If no such n exists, we put Br.dimp pF q \u0010 8.\n\nExamples 4.2.\n(1) M. Artin conjectured in [Art82] that Br.dimpF q \u0010 1 for\nevery C2 field F . He proved that Br.dim2 pF q \u0010 Br.dim3 pF q \u0010 1 for such\nfields, but no more is known.\n(2) For F finitely generated and of transcendence degree 1 over an l-adic field\nBr.dimp pF q \u0010 2 for every prime p \u0018 l by [Sal97a]. Is Br.diml pF q finite?\n(3) If F is a complete discretely valued field with residue field k such that\nBr.dimp pk q \u00a4 d for all primes p \u0018 charpk q, then Br.dimp pF q \u00a4 d 1 for all\np \u0018 charpk q by [HHK09, Th. 5.5].\nExample 4.3. If F has characteristic p and transcendence degree r over a perfect\nfield k, then Br.dimp pF q \u00a4 r by the argument in the discussion on page 7 for\np-algebras.\nProblem 4.4. If F is finitely generated over a field F0 with Br.dimpF0 q finite, is\nBr.dimpF q necessarily finite?\n\n\fOPEN PROBLEMS ON CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS\n\n13\n\nIt is natural to start by considering only certain fields F0 . For example, suppose that F has prime characteristic p and we take F0 to be its prime field, so\nBr.dimpF0 q \u0010 0. If F has transcendence degree 1 over F0 , then F is global and\nBr.dimpF q \u0010 1. If F has transcendence degree 2 over F0 , then Br.dimpF q \u00a4 3 by\n[Lie08].\nProblem 4.5. Define a notion of \"dimension\" for some class of fields F such that\nBr.dimpF q \u00a4 dim F\n\n\u00011\n\nand\n\ndimpF ptqq \u0010 dim F\n\n1.\n\nOne possibility would be to set a Ci field to have dimension i. The notion of cohomological dimension is obviously not the right one in view of Merkurjev's example\nof a field F with cohomological dimension 2 and Br.dimpF q \u0010 8 from [Mer92].\n5. Center of generic matrices\nAmitsur's universal division algebra has already appeared several times in these\nnotes. In this section, we discuss some interesting questions regarding its center.\nWe begin with the definition. Let F be a field, let V \u0010 Mn pF q ` Mn pF q, and\nlet F pV q be the field of rational functions on V . For k \u0010 1, 2, let xijk be the\ncoordinate function defined by the standard elementary matrix Eij ` 0 or 0 ` Eij ,\ndepending on k, and set Xk \u0010 pxijk q P Mn pF pV qq. We call the F -algebra RpF, nq\ngenerated by X1 and X2 the ring of (two) generic n-by-n matrices over F ([Sal99,\nCh. 14]). It is a noncommutative domain that can be specialized to give any central\nsimple L-algebra of degree n, for every extension L of F [Sal99, 14.1]. The field\nof fractions of its center C pF, nq \u0080 RpF, nq is denoted by Z pF, nq, and called the\ncenter of generic n-by-n matrices over F . The (central) localization of RpF, nq by\nthe nonzero elements of C pF, nq is denoted by UDpF, nq, and called the generic\ndivision algebra of degree n over F . In the language of [GMS03, p. 11], the class of\nUDpF, nq in H1 pZ pF, nq, PGLn q is a versal torsor.\nThere is another way to view the above construction, due to Procesi. Let\nPGLn pF q \u0010 GLn pF q{F \u0002 be the projective linear group. This group has a representation on V via the action A \u0004 pB1 , B2 q \u0010 pAB1 A\u00011 , AB2 A\u00011 q. It follows\nthat PGLn pF q acts on F pV q, and one can show the invariant field F pV qPGLn pF q\nis Z pF, nq. Furthermore, PGLn pF q acts naturally on Mn pF pV qq \u0010 Mn pF q bF\nF pV q via the action on each tensor factor, and one can show the invariant ring\nMn pF pV qqPGLn pF q is UDpF, nq (see [Sal99, Thm 14.16] for proofs of both results).\nThis invariant field point of view puts the problems of this section in the bigger context of birational invariant fields of reductive groups and particularly the birational\ninvariant fields of almost free representations of reductive groups.\nOne can begin with the above construction and modify it to make other generic\nconstructions. For example, put D :\u0010 UDpF, nq and Z :\u0010 Z pF, nq and assume\nm divides n. Let Zm pF, nq be the generic splitting field of the division algebra\nequivalent to Dbm over Z, and set UDm pF, nq \u0010 D bZ Zm pF, nq. Then UDm pF, nq\nis a generic division algebra of degree n and period m with center Zm pF, nq. In the\nlanguage of [GMS03], the class of UDm pF, nq in H 1 pZm pF, nq, GLn {\u03bcm q is a versal\ntorsor. Another example uses Procesi's result that Z pF, nq \u0010 F pM qSn where Sn is\nthe symmetric group and M is a specific Sn lattice (see [Sal99, Thm 14.17]). The\ngroup Sn appears because it is the Galois group of the Galois closure of a \"generic\"\nmaximal subfield of UDpF, nq. It follows that if H \u0080 Sn is a subgroup and we set\nZH pF, nq \u0010 F pM qH , then UDH pF, nq \u0010 D bZ ZH pF, nq is a generic central simple\n\n\f14\n\nASHER AUEL, ERIC BRUSSEL, SKIP GARIBALDI, AND UZI VISHNE\n\nalgebra having H as the Galois group of the Galois closure of a maximal subfield.\nIn particular, if H has order n and acts transitively on t1, . . . , nu (we say H is a\ntransitive subgroup of Sn ) we have formed the generic H-crossed product algebra\nand its center. One can combine these constructions and form generic crossed\nproducts of period m, but we will have nothing to say about these.\nThe general problem addressed here concerns the properties of the fields Z pF, nq\nand their subsidiary fields Zm pF, nq and ZH pF, nq. To state the questions, define\nL{F to be rational if L is purely transcendental over F . Define L{F to be stably\nrational if there is a rational L1 {L such that L1 {F is rational. More generally, say\nthat L1 {F and L2 {F are stably isomorphic if there are rational L1i {Li such that\nL11 \u0015 L12 over F . Finally, define L{F to be retract rational if the following holds.\nThere is a localized polynomial ring R \u0010 F rx1 , . . . , xr sp1{sq and an F subalgebra\nS \u0080 R with an F algebra retraction R \u00d1 S (meaning S \u00d1 R \u00d1 S is the identity)\nsuch that L is the field of fractions of S. It is pretty clear that rational implies\nstably rational implies retract rational, and in fact (much harder) these implications\ncannot be reversed.\nTo simplify the discussion note the result of Katsylo [Kat90] and Schofield [Sch92]\nthat if n \u0010 ab for a and b relatively prime, then Z pF, nq is stably isomorphic to the\nfield compositum Z pF, aq Z pF, bq. Similar statements are possible for the Zm pF, nq\nand ZH pF, nq. This often (but not always) allows reduction to the case where n is\na prime power.\nProblem 5.1. [Pro67, p. 240] Is Z pF, nq{F rational, stably rational, or retract\nrational? The same question for Zm pF, nq and ZH pF, nq.\nThis appears as Problem 8 in [Sal92] (see also Saltman's Problems 9, 10, and 11),\nand is a major topic of the surveys [Le 91] and [For02]. We note that Z pF, nq{F\nis retract rational if and only if division algebras of degree n have the so-called\nlifting property, see [Sal99, p. 77]. Similar statements can be made for Zm pF, nq\nand ZH pF, nq.\nWhen n is 2, 3, or 4 then Z pF, nq is rational, as proved (respectively) by Sylvester,\nProcesi and Formanek. When n is 5 or 7 Bessenrodt and Lebruyn showed in [BL91]\nthat Z pF, nq is stably rational, and a second, more elementary proof of this was\ngiven by Beneish [Ben98].\nThere are a few results for the Zm pF, nq. The field Z2 pF, 4q is stably rational\nby Saltman [Sal02], and Saltman\u2013Tignol [ST02] showed that Z2 pF, 8q is retract\nrational. Beneish [Ben05] showed that Z2 pF, 8q is stably rational. Finally, we leave\nto the well-read reader to prove that when H \u0080 Sn is cyclic and transitive and F\ncontains a primitive n-th root of unity, then ZH pF, nq is rational (and results are\navailable for general F , n not of the form 8m, and retract rationality). Thus the\nfirst interesting specific question along these lines is:\nProblem 5.2. Determine if ZH pF, 9q is rational, stably rational, or retract rational,\nwhere H \u0010 C3 \u0002 C3 \u0080 S9 is transitive.\n6. Essential dimension\nEssential dimension counts the number of parameters needed to define an algebraic structure. This notion was introduced in the late 1990s by Buhler\u2013Reichstein\n[BR97] and placed in a general functorial context by Merkurjev [BF03]. Given a\nfield F , a functor F : FieldsF \u00d1 Sets from the category of field extensions of F\n\n\fOPEN PROBLEMS ON CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS\n\n15\n\n(together with F -embeddings) to the category of sets, a field extension F \u00d1 K,\nand an element a P F pK q, a field of definition of a is a field extension F \u00d1 L and\nan F -embedding L \u00d1 K such that a is in the image of the map F pLq \u00d1 F pK q.\nThe essential dimension of a (over F ), denoted by edF paq, is the infimum of the\ntranscendence degrees trdegF pLq over all fields of definition L of a. Finally, the\nessential dimension of F is the number\nedF pF q \u0010 suptedF paqu\n\nwhere the supremum is taken over all field extensions F \u00d1 K and all elements\na P F pK q. We will suppress the dependence on the base field F when no confusion\nmay arise.\nThe essential p-dimension of F , denoted by edF,p pF q or simply edp pF q, is defined similarly. One replaces edF paq with edF,p paq, which is the infimum of edF paK 1 q\nas K 1 varies over all finite embeddings K \u00d1K 1 of prime-to-p degree. Obviously,\nedF,p paq \u00a4 edF paq for all a, hence edF,p pF q \u00a4 edF pF q.\n\nDefinition 6.1. The essential dimension edpGq \u0010 edF pGq of an algebraic group G\nover F is the essential dimension of the functor H1 p\u0001, Gq. Similarly, the essential\np-dimension edp pGq \u0010 edF,p pGq of G is the essential p-dimension of the functor\nH1 p\u0001, Gq.\n\nThe essential dimension of a algebraic group G equals the essential dimension\nof any versal G-torsor, see [BF03, \u00a76]. For a broad survey of essential dimension\nresults, see Reichstein's sectional address [Rei10] to the 2010 ICM in Hyderabad,\nIndia.\nThe functor H1 p\u0001, PGLn q is identified via Galois descent with the functor assigning to a field extension F \u00d1 K the isomorphism classes of central simple K-algebras\nof degree n. As we shall discuss below, computation of the essential dimension of\nPGLn is relevant to the theory of central simple algebras, in the sense that knowing\nthe \"number of parameters\" needed to define central simple algebras of degree n\ncan lead to conclusions about their structural properties (e.g. concerning decomposability and crossed product structure).\nProblem 6.2. Compute the essential dimension and the essential p-dimension of\nPGLn . In particular:\n(1) Compute edF pPGL4 q when char F \u0010 2.\n(2) Compute edF pPGL5 q.\n\nWhat is known. The generic division algebra UDpF, nq of degree n corresponds to\na versal PGLn -torsor, see \u00a75. It is immediate from Procesi's description of Z pF, nq\nby means of invariants that edpPGLn q \u00a4 n2 1, see [Pro67, Th. 1.8]. With some\nadditional work, Procesi [Pro67, Th. 2.1] proved that edpPGLn q \u00a4 n2 . The current\nbest upper bounds are\nedpPGLn q \u00a4\n\n#\n\npn \u0001 1qpn \u0001 2q if n \u00a5 5 and n is odd\nif n \u00a5 4, F \u0010 Fsep , and charpF q \u0010 0\nn2 \u0001 3n 1\n1\n2\n\nsee [LRRS03, Th. 1.1], [Lem04, Prop. 1.6], and [FF08].\nTsen's theorem can be used to show that edpPGLn q\n[Rei00, Lemma 9.4a]. The current best lower bounds are\n\nedpPGLn q \u00a5 edp pPGLn q \u00a5 pr \u0001 1qpr\n\n\u00a5\n\n2 for any n\n1\n\n\u00a5 2, see\n\n\f16\n\nASHER AUEL, ERIC BRUSSEL, SKIP GARIBALDI, AND UZI VISHNE\n\nwhere pr is the highest power of p dividing n and we assume char F \u0018 p, see\nMerkurjev [Merar] and the discussion below. This improves on the long-standing\nlower bound edpPGLpr q \u00a5 edp pPGLpr q \u00a5 2r in [Rei99, Th. 16.1], [RY00, Th. 8.6].\nFinally, because of the decomposition of central simple algebras into prime powers,\nedpPGLnm q \u00a4 edpPGLn q edpPGLm q if pn, mq \u0010 1.\nTable 6 lists current bounds for edpPGLn q for small values of n, obtained by\ncombining the bounds in this discussion with those after the discussion of Problem\n6.4. (A slightly different table on the same topic can be found at the end of Baek's\nthesis [Bae10].) Of course, the bounds may improve upon further specification of the\nfield. The cases for n \u0010 4 in characteristic 2 and for n \u0010 5 are the smallest unknown\ncases, and each has important implications for the crossed product problems of \u00a72\nand \u00a71, respectively (see discussion below). The feeble bounds on the second line\nof the table-when the characteristic divides n-illustrate our lack of knowledge in\nthis case. One of the few positive results is that the upper bound edpPGL4 q \u00a4 5\nfrom [LRRS03, Cor. 3.10(a)] holds without hypotheses on the base field.\nn\nedpPGLn q\nchar F \u001f n\nedpPGLn q\nchar F \u0017 n\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n5\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\u20135\n\n5\n\n2: \u2013 6\n3\u20136\n2\u20136\n\n6\n2:\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n2: \u2013 15 17 \u2013 64 10 \u2013 28 2: \u2013 8\n\n3 \u2013 15\n3\n2 \u2013 3 2 \u2013 15\n\n3\u20138\n\n2 \u2013 64\n\n2 \u2013 28\n\n2\u20138\n\nTable 6.

Every central simple algebra of degree p becomes cyclic over a prime-to-p extension, eventually leading to\nedp pPGLp q \u0010 2, see [RY00, Lemma 8.5.7]. Using an extension of Karpenko's incompressibility theorem to products of p-primary Severi\u2013Brauer varieties, Karpenko\u2013\nMerkurjev [KM08] provide a formula for the essential dimension of any finite pgroup, considered over a field containing the p-th roots of unity. This general\nformula was extended to twisted p-groups and algebraic tori in [LMMR09], and\nultimately used with great success by Merkurjev [Mer10], [Merar] to establish the\nformula edp pPGLp2 q \u0010 p2 1 for any field F with char F \u0018 p, and the current best\nlower bound\n(6.3)\n\npr \u0001 1qpr\n\n1 \u00a4 edp pPGLpr q \u00a4 p2r\u00012\n\n1.\n\nThe above upper bound is in a recent preprint by Ruozzi [Ruo10], improving on\n[MR09, Th. 1.1]. For p \u0010 2 and r \u0010 3, note that the upper and lower bounds\ncoincide, yielding ed2 pPGL8 q \u0010 17 when char F \u0018 2.\n\nAsymptotic bounds. It might be illustrative to view these bounds on edpPGLn q\nasymptotically, in terms of big-O notation. In that language, we have the naive\nupper bound that edpPGLn q is Opn2 q and the naive lower bound that it is \u03a9p1q,\nbecause it is between n2 1 and 2. The furious profusion of bounds listed in\nthis section are invisible in this context, except for Merkurjev's lower bound (6.3),\nwhich shows that edpPGLn q is not Opnq. (This settled in the negative Bruno Kahn's\n\n\fOPEN PROBLEMS ON CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS\n\n17\n\n\"barbecue problem\" posed in 1992 [MR09, \u00a71].) The gap between the upper and\nlower bounds for PGL?n stands in interesting\nconstrast with the situtation for Spinn :\n?n\nn\nedpSpinn q is both Op 2 q and?\n\u03a9p 2 q, i.e., is asymptotically bounded both above\nn\nand below by constants times 2 , by [BRV10].\nEssential dimension and crossed products. Let G be a finite group of order\nn \u00a5 2. Let CPAlgn (resp. AlgG ) be the functor FieldsF \u00d1 Sets assigning to F \u00d1 K\nthe set of isomorphism classes of crossed product (resp. G-crossed product) Kalgebras of degree n. Of course, edpCPAlgn q is the maximum of edpAlgG q over all\ngroups G of order n. These functors are relevant to the crossed product problem\ndiscussed in \u00a72. For example, edpAlgG q \u00a4 edpCPAlgn q \u00a4 edpPGLn q, with equality\nif every central simple algebra of degree n over every field extension of F is a Gcrossed product. An inequality edpCPAlgn q edpPGLn q would imply the existence\nof a noncrossed product algebra of degree n over some field extension of F .\nProblem 6.4. Determine structural conclusions about central simple algebras from\nessential (p-)dimension bounds.\n(1) Calculate bounds for edpCPAlgn q and edpAlg G q.\n(2) Compute the difference edpAlg G q \u0001 edpGq.\n(3) If edpCPAlgn q \u0010 edpPGLn q, determine whether every algebra of degree n\nover every extension of F is a crossed product.\n\nWhat is known. By [Alb61, IX.6, Theorem 9], H1 p\u0001, PGLn q is isomorphic to the\nfunctor AlgG for n \u0010 2, 3, 6 and G \u0010 Cn , and for n \u0010 4 and G \u0010 C2 \u0002 C2 . A result\ncommunicated to us by Merkurjev states that edpAlgCn q \u0010 edpCn q 1 when char F\ndoes not divide n (see Prop. 6.6). Since edpC2 q \u0010 edpC3 q \u0010 1 (over any field, see\ncf. [Ser08, \u00a71.1], [JLY02, \u00a72.1]), and edpC6 q equals 1 or 2 (depending on whether F\ncontains the 6-th roots of unity or not), we obtain the values listed in Table 6 for\nn \u0010 2, 3, 6 and char F not dividing n. When n \u0010 6 and char F divides n, one can\nshow that edpC6 q \u0010 2 using [Led07, Th. 1], and therefore 2 \u00a4 edpPGL6 q \u00a4 3. Note\nthat Prop. 6.6 resolves Problem 6.4(2) for G \u0010 Cn , when char F does not divide n.\nIn [Merar, Th. 7.1], Merkurjev proved that edpAlgC2 \u0002C2 q \u0010 5 when char F \u0018 2,\nand thus edpPGL4 q \u0010 5 (see also Rost [Ros00]). Note that since edpAlg C4 q \u0010\nedpC4 q 1 \u00a4 3 when char F \u0018 2, this implies the existence of noncyclic algebras of\ndegree 4 (and period 4), as exhibited in [Alb33].\nOne can bound edpAlg G q by bounding the number of generators of G. If a\nfinite group G of order n can be generated be r \u00a5 2 elements, then edpAlgG q \u00a4\npr \u0001 1qn 1, see [LRRS03, Cor. 3.10a]. This shows edpPGL4 q \u00a4 5 when char F \u0010 2.\nThe bound is sharp for char F \u0018 p: if G \u0010 Cpr for r \u00a5 2 and char F \u0018 p, then\nedpAlgG q \u0010 edp pAlgG q \u0010 pr \u0001 1qpr 1 by [Merar, Th. 7.1]. Note that this resolves\nProblem 6.4(1) for elementary abelian G. One can bound the number of generators\nby r \u00a4 log2 pnq for n \u00a5 4, see [LRRS03, Cor. 3.10b], and this bound is realized on\nelementary abelian 2-groups. Thus edpCPAlgn q \u00a4 plog2 pnq \u0001 1qn 1 for n \u00a5 4.\nNow we have:\nedpCPAlg8 q \u00a4 17 \u0010 ed2 pPGL8 q \u00a4 edpPGL8 q.\nAs there exist non-crossed products of degree 8, it is reasonable to guess that at\nleast one of the two inequalities is strict.\n\n\f18\n\nASHER AUEL, ERIC BRUSSEL, SKIP GARIBALDI, AND UZI VISHNE\n\nAlgebras with small exponent. The functor H1 p\u0001, GLn {\u03bcm q assigns to a field\nK the isomorphism classes of central simple K-algebras of degree n and period dividing m. Of course, H1 p\u0001, GLn {\u03bcn q \u0010 H1 p\u0001, PGLn q. By Albert's theorem, every\nalgebra of degree 4 and period 2 is biquaternion, ultimately yielding edpGL4 {\u03bc2 q \u0010\ned2 pGL4 {\u03bc2 q \u0010 4 when char F \u0018 2, see [BM10, Rem. 8.2].

Similarly, for GL8 {\u03bc2 , Rowen [Row78] produced triquadratic splitting fields, ultimately yielding edpGL8 {\u03bc2 q \u0010 ed2 pGL8 {\u03bc2 q \u0010 8 when\nchar F \u0018 2, see [BM10, Cor. 8.3]. In particular, this implies the existence of algebras of degree 8 and period 2 (when char F \u0018 2) that are not decomposable as a\nproduct of three quaternion algebras; such examples were exhibited in [ART79].\nWhen char F \u0018 p, the current best bounds for edp pGLpr {\u03bcps q are\n#\n\n*\n22r\u00012\nfor p \u0010 2 and s \u0010 1\npr \u0001 1q2r\u00011\nedp pGLp {\u03bcp q \u00a4\n\u00a4\nr\nr \u0001s\npr \u0001 1qp p\np2r\u00012 pr\u0001s otherwise\nfor r \u00a5 2 and 1 \u00a4 s \u00a4 r, see [BM10, Th. 6.1, 7.2], [Ruo10, Th. 1.1], and [Bae10,\nTh. 4.1.30].

Since clearly edF pAlgCn q \u00a4 edF pCn q 1, it suffices to produce an algebra\nwith essential dimension at least edF pCn q 1. Suppose K {F is a field extension,\nL{K is a cyclic field extension of degree n, and A \u0010 pL{K, \u03c3, tq is a cyclic crossed\nproduct over the rational function field K ptq. The parameter t defines a discrete\nvaluation v on K, and we have a residue Bv pAq \u0010 \u03c7, for an element \u03c7 of order\nn in the character group X pK q. If A is defined as A0 over an extension E {F ,\nthen t defines a discrete valuation v0 on E, and Bv0 pA0 q \u0010 \u03c70 P X p\u03bapv0 qq. Since\nthe residue map commutes with scalar extension-scaled by the ramification index if necessary-\u03c70 has order at least n, hence edF pCn q \u00a4 trdegF p\u03bapv0 qq. Since\n\u0003\ntrdegF p\u03bapv0 qq trdegF pE q, we conclude edF pCn q edF pAq.\n7. Springer problem for involutions\nInvolutions on central simple algebras are ring-antiautomorphisms of period 2.\nThey come in different types, depending on their action on the center and on the\ntype of bilinear forms they are adjoint to after scalar extension to an algebraic\nclosure of the center: an involution is of orthogonal (resp. symplectic) type if it\nis adjoint to a symmetric, nonalternating bilinear form (resp. to an alternating\n\n\fOPEN PROBLEMS ON CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS\n\n19\n\nbilinear form) over an algebraic closure; it is of unitary type if its restriction to\nthe center is not the identity. The correspondence between central simple algebras\nwith involution and linear algebraic groups of classical type was first pointed out\nby Andr\u00e9 Weil [Wei60]; it is a deep source of inspiration for the development of the\ntheory of central simple algebras with involution, see [KMRT98]. For semisimple\nlinear algebraic groups, Tits defined in [Tit66] a notion of index, which generalizes\nthe Schur index of central simple algebras and the Witt index of quadratic forms.\nAnisotropic general linear groups arise from division algebras, and anisotropic quadratic forms yield anisotropic orthogonal groups. More generally, every adjoint\ngroup of type 1Dn or 2Dn over a field of characteristic different from 2 can be represented as the group of automorphisms of a central simple algebra A of degree 2n\nwith orthogonal involution \u03c3; the group is anisotropic if and only if \u03c3 is anisotropic\nin the following sense: for x P A, the equation \u03c3 pxqx \u0010 0 implies x \u0010 0. The\nbehavior of the index under scalar extension is a major subject of study, to which\nthe following problem, first formulated in [BST93, p. 475], pertains:\nProblem 7.1. Suppose \u03c3 is an anisotropic orthogonal or symplectic involution on\na central simple algebra A over a field F . Does \u03c3 remain anisotropic after scalar\nextension to any odd-degree field extension of F ?\n\n(If char F \u0010 2, the question makes sense, but to preserve the relation with linear\nalgebraic groups one should replace the orthogonal involution \u03c3 with a quadratic\npair [KMRT98, \u00a75B].)\nRepresenting A as EndD V for some vector space V over a division algebra D,\nwe may rephrase the problem in terms of hermitian forms: if a hermitian or skewhermitian form over a division algebra with orthogonal or symplectic involution\nis anisotropic, does it remain anisotropic after any odd-degree extension? When\nthe central simple algebra is split (which is always the case if its degree deg A is\nodd), orthogonal involutions are adjoint to symmetric bilinear forms, and the problem has an affirmative solution by a well-known theorem of Springer [EKM08,\nCor. 18.5] (actually first proven-but not published-by E. Artin in 1937, see\n[Kah08, Rem. 1.5.3]). On the other hand, every symplectic involution on a split\nalgebra is hyperbolic, hence isotropic, so the problem does not arise for symplectic\ninvolutions on split algebras. At the other extreme, if A is a division algebra, then\nthe solution is obviously affirmative, since A remains a division algebra after any\nodd-degree extension and every involution on a division algebra is anisotropic.\nVariants of Problem 7.1 take into account the \"size\" of the isotropy: call a right\nideal I \u0080 A isotropic for an involution \u03c3 if \u03c3 pI q \u0004 I \u0010 t0u, and define its reduced\ndim I\ndimension by rdim I \u0010 deg\nA . The reduced dimension of a right ideal can be any\nmultiple of the Schur index ind A between ind A and deg A, but for isotropic ideals\nwe have rdim I \u00a4 12 deg A, see [KMRT98, \u00a76A]. The involution \u03c3 is called metabolic\nif A contains an isotropic ideal of reduced dimension 12 deg A. A weak version of\nSpringer's theorem holds for arbitrary involutions: Bayer\u2013Lenstra proved in [BL90,\nProp. 1.2] that an involution that is not metabolic cannot become metabolic over\nan odd-degree field extension. As a result, Problem 7.1 also has an affirmative\nsolution when ind A \u0010 12 deg A, for in this case isotropy implies metabolicity. (See\n[BFT07, Th. 1.14] for the analogue for quadratic pairs.)\nIf char F \u0018 2 and ind A \u0010 2, Problem 7.1 was solved in the affirmative by\nParimala\u2013Sridharan\u2013Suresh [PSS01]. The symplectic case is easily reduced to the\ncase of quadratic forms by an observation of Jacobson relating hermitian forms over\n\n\f20\n\nASHER AUEL, ERIC BRUSSEL, SKIP GARIBALDI, AND UZI VISHNE\n\nquaternion algebras to quadratic forms. The orthogonal case also is reduced to the\ncase of quadratic forms, using scalar extension to the function field of the conic\nthat splits A. That approach relates Problem 7.1 to another important question,\nto which Parimala\u2013Sridharan\u2013Suresh gave a positive solution when ind A \u0010 2 and\nchar F \u0018 2:\nProblem 7.2. Suppose \u03c3 is an anisotropic orthogonal involution on a central simple\nalgebra A over a field F . Does \u03c3 remain anisotropic after scalar extension to the\nfunction field FA of the Severi\u2013Brauer variety of A?\n(This is a special case of a general problem concerning semisimple algebraic\ngroups, namely whether a projective homogeneous variety under one group has a\nrational point over the function field of a projective homogeneous variety under\nanother group. From this perspective, Problem 7.2 is asking for an analogue of the\nindex reduction results from [SvdB92], [MPW96], [MPW98], etc.)\nBy Springer's theorem, an affirmative answer to Problem 7.2 readily implies that\nProblem 7.1 has an affirmative solution for orthogonal involutions. Surprisingly,\nKarpenko [Kar09a] recently proved that the converse also holds when char F \u0018 2:\nan orthogonal involution cannot become isotropic over FA unless it also becomes\nisotropic over some odd-degree extension of F .\nProblem 7.2 is addressed in the following papers (besides [PSS01] and [Kar09a]):\n[Kar00], [Kar09b], [Gar09b], [Karar]. In [Kar00] and [Kar10, 2.5], Karpenko gives\nan affirmative solution when A is a division algebra. This result is superseded in\n[Kar09b], where he proves that for any quadratic pair on a central simple algebra\nA of arbitrary characteristic, the Witt index of the quadratic form to which the\nquadratic pair is adjoint over FA is a multiple of ind A. In particular, it follows that\nif the quadratic pair becomes hyperbolic over FA , then ind A divides 21 deg A. An\nalternative proof of the latter result is given by Zainoulline in [Gar09b, Appendix A].\nA much stronger statement was soon proved by Karpenko [Karar]: if char F \u0018 2,\nan orthogonal involution that is not hyperbolic cannot become hyperbolic over FA .\n(The special case where deg A \u0010 8 and ind A \u0010 4 was obtained earlier by Sivatski\nin [Siv05, Prop. 3], using Laghribi's work on 8-dimensional quadratic forms [Lag96,\nTh\u00e9or\u00e8me 4].)\nNote that the orthogonal and symplectic cases of Problem 7.1 are related by\nthe following observation: tensoring a given central simple F -algebra with involution pA, \u03c3 q with the \"generic\" quaternion algebra px, y qF px,yq with its conjugation\ninvolution yields a central simple F px, y q-algebra with involution pA1 , \u03c3 1 q, which is\nanisotropic if and only if \u03c3 is anisotropic. If char F \u0018 2, the involution \u03c3 1 is orthogonal (resp. symplectic) if and only if \u03c3 is symplectic (resp. orthogonal). Therefore,\na negative solution to Problem 7.1 for a given degree d and index i in the orthogonal (resp., symplectic) case readily yields a negative solution in the symplectic\n(resp. orthogonal) case in degree 2d and index 2i. The same idea can be used to\nobtain symplectic versions of the results on Problem 7.2, where FA is replaced by\na field over which the index of A is generically reduced to 2, see [Karar, App. A].\nIf char F \u0018 2, the smallest index for which Problem 7.1 is open is 4, and the\nsmallest degree is 12. Since Parimala\u2013Sridharan\u2013Suresh do not address the characteristic 2 case in [PSS01], Problem 7.1-restated for quadratic pairs-seems to\nbe open in this case already for index 2 and degree 8. (The answer to Problem\n7.1 is \"yes\" in the degree 6 case. This can be seen via the exceptional isomorphism\nD3 \u0010 A3 .)\n\n\fOPEN PROBLEMS ON CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS\n\n21\n\nUnitary involutions. The analogue of Problem 7.1 for unitary involutions was\nsolved in the negative in [PSS01]: for any odd prime p, there is a central simple\nalgebra A of degree 2p and index p with anisotropic unitary involution over a field\nF \u0010 lpptqq, where l is a ramified quadratic extension of a p-adic field k, which\nbecomes isotropic over any odd-degree extension of F that splits A. If p \u00a5 5, there\nare unitary involutions on division algebras of degree p that become isotropic after\nscalar extension to any maximal subfield. As Parimala\u2013Sridharan\u2013Suresh suggest\nat the end of their paper, the correct analogue of Problem 7.1 for unitary involutions\nshould probably ask: Does the involution remain anisotropic after scalar extension\nto a field extension of degree coprime to 2 ind A?\nMotivated by this observation, we can generalize Problem 7.1 by asking:\nProblem 7.3. Let G be an absolutely almost simple linear algebraic group that is\nanisotropic over F . Does G remain anisotropic over every finite extension K {F of\ndimension not divisible by any prime in S pGq?\n\nHere S pGq denotes the set of 'homological torsion primes' from [Ser95, 2.2.3],\nexhibited in Table 7. Roughly speaking, the results on Problem 7.1 for orthogonal\nand symplectic involutions concern the types B, C, and D cases of Problem 7.3 and\nthe results for unitary involutions concern the type A case. The answer to Problem\n7.3 is \"yes\" for G of type G2 or F4 ; this can be seen by inspecting the cohomological\ninvariants of these groups described in [KMRT98].\nelements of S pGq\ntype of G\nAn\n2 and prime divisors of n 1\nBn , Cn , Dn (n \u00a1 4), G2\n2\n2 and 3\nD4 , F4 , E6 , E7\nE8\n2, 3, and 5\nTable 7.

Artin\u2013Tate Conjecture\nMotivated by an analogue of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for\nabelian varieties over global fields of characteristic p, Tate (reporting on joint work\nwith Artin) [Tat66b] introduces a host of conjectures for surfaces over finite fields.\nAs most of the progress on these conjectures has been made from their connection\nwith the Tate conjecture on algebraic cycles and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer\nconjecture, a natural challenge arises: Can progress be made on the conjectures in\nthis section using \"central simple algebra techniques\"?\nLet k \u0010 Fq be a finite field of characteristic p and X a geometrically connected,\n2\npX, Gm q, which equals the\nsmooth, and projective k-surface.

Conjecture T is known for many special classes of surfaces: rational surfaces (Milne [Mil70]), Fermat hypersurfaces X0n X1n X2n X3n \u0010 0, with\np \u0011 1 mod n or pa \u0011 \u00011 mod n for some a (Tate [Tat65, \u00a73]), abelian surfaces and\nproducts of two curves (Tate [Tat66a, Th. 4]), K3 surfaces with a pencil of elliptic\ncurves (Artin and Swinnerton-Dyer [ASD73, Th. 5.2]), K3 surface of finite height\n(where p \u00a5 5) (Nygaard [Nyg83, Cor. 3.4] and Nygaard\u2013Ogus [NO85, Theorem\n0.2]), and certain classes of Hilbert modular surfaces (Harder\u2013Langlands\u2013Rapoport\n[HLR86], Murty\u2013Kumar\u2013Ramakrishnan [MR87], Langer [Lan00], [Lan04]). Furthermore, Conjecture T respects birational equivalence and finite morphisms. In\nparticular, Conjecture T holds for unirational surfaces and Kummer surfaces. Also,\nConjecture T holds for any surface which lifts to a smooth surface in characteristic\nzero with geometric genus pg \u0010 0.\nRelationship with the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture.

Otherwise, there are a host of results on the BSD conjecture for particular classes of\nabelian varieties over global fields of characteristic p. For a modern treatment of\nthe BSD conjecture for abelian varieties over number fields, see Hindry\u2013Silverman\n[HS00, Appendix F.4].\nNow, let C be a geometrically connected, smooth, and projective k-curve with\nfunction field K \u0010 k pC q and suppose that there is a proper flat morphism f :\nX \u00d1 C with generic fiber XK a geometrically connected, smooth, and projective\nK-curve.

The Artin\u2013Tate conjecture d is proved by Liu\u2013Lorenzini\u2013Raynaud\n[LLR05], following a suggestion of Leslie Saper. In fact, as shown in [LLR05, Proof\nof Theorem 1], any geometrically connected, smooth, and projective k-surface X is\nbirational to another such surface X 1 admitting a proper flat morphism f 1 : X 1 \u00d1 P1\nwith geometrically connected, smooth, and projective generic fiber.

This pairing is\nnon-degenerate on the prime-to-p part of the Brauer group and has kernel consisting of the maximal divisible subgroup of BrpX q. In particular, if BrpX q is assumed\nto be finite, it must have order either a square or twice a square.\nIn the late 1960s, Manin published examples of rational surfaces over finite fields\nwith Brauer group of order 2. Finally, in 1996, Urabe found a mistake in Manin's\nexamples and proved that rational surfaces always have Brauer groups of square\norder. The proof that 2BrpX q is a square in [LLR05] uses knowledge of 2 XpAq, via\nTheorem 8.2.\nThe (conjectural) square order of BrpX q would immediately result from the\nexistence of a non-degenerate alternating pairing. Of course, this is only a nontrivial\nquestion on the 2-primary torsion BrpX qp2q of the Brauer group.\nProblem 8.4. Given a geometrically connected, smooth, projective surface X over\na finite field k, is there a non-degenerate alternating pairing on BrpX qp2q with values\nin Q{Z?\nThis is addressed in Urabe [Ura96, Th. 0.3], where it is proved that the restriction\nof Tate's skew-symmetric form to kerpBrpX q \u00d1 BrpX qq is alternating.

The tensor product problem\nBoth surveys [Ami82] and [Sal92] address problems concerning division algebra\ndecomposability. We say an F -division algebra D is decomposable if there exist F division algebras A and B such that D \u0014 A bF B. All division algebras decompose\ninto p-primary tensor factors, and all p-primary factors with equal period and index\nare indecomposable, so the problem of when a division algebra decomposes is only\ninteresting for division algebras of unequal prime-power period and index. Albert\nproved that any division algebra of period 2 and index 4 is decomposable in [Alb32],\nand for a long time all known division algebras of unequal period and index were\ndecomposable by construction. However, in 1979 Saltman and Amitsur\u2013Rowen\u2013\nTignol independently constructed nontrivially indecomposable division algebras, in\n[Sal79] and [ART79]. In 1991 Jacob produced indecomposable division algebras of\nprime period p and index pn for any n \u00a5 1, except when p \u0010 2 and n \u0010 2 ([Jac91]).\nThus by the time of Saltman's survey [Sal92], examples had been produced of every\nconceivable period-index combination, though not in every characteristic.\nOne of the few remaining gaps in the list of [Sal92] was filled shortly afterwards\nby Karpenko, who produced indecomposable division algebras (of a generic type)\nin any characteristic with any odd prime-power period pm and index pn , for any\nm \u00a4 n (see also [McK08]), and period 2 and index 2n for n \u00a5 3. The odd degree\nexamples used the index reduction formula [SvdB92] of Schofield and van den Bergh\nand the theory of cycles on Severi\u2013Brauer varieties ([Kar95]), and the 2-power\ndegree examples used his theorem [Kar98, Prop. 5.3] that a division algebra A\nof prime period is indecomposable if the torsion subgroup of the Chow group of\ncodimension-2 cycles on A's Severi\u2013Brauer variety is nontrivial. The two problems\non indecomposability asked in [Sal92] were settled by Brussel in [Bru00] (Problem\n6) and [Bru96] (Problem 7), respectively. However, Brussel's solution to Problem\n6, which asked for an indecomposable division algebra of prime degree pn that\nbecomes decomposable over a prime-to-p extension, relied on the absence of a p-th\nroot of unity, and Problem 6 remains open for fields containing the p-th roots of\nunity. Thus the search for a \"geometric\" obstruction to decomposability is still\ninteresting. For example, Karpenko's examples resulting from Karpenko's theorem\nare manifestly stable under prime-to-p extension.\nProblem 9.1.

If indpA bF B q\nfields for the F -division algebras A and B?\nWhat is known. The first major result concerning the tensor product question\nwas Albert's theorem that the tensor product of central quaternion algebras is a\ndivision algebra if and only if they do not have a common maximal subfield ([Alb32,\nTh. 6]). Using a similar proof, Risman [Ris75] showed that for any quaternion\nalgebra A and any division algebra B, if A b B is not a division algebra, then either\nB contains a field K such that A b K is not a division algebra, or A contains a field\nK such that K b B is not a division algebra.\nIn spite of Albert's theorem for quaternions, Tignol and Wadsworth [TW87,\nProp. 5.1] produced for any odd integer n an example in which A and B are division\nalgebras of degree n, A bF B is not a division algebra, yet A and B have no common\nmaximal subfields. Saltman pointed out that for these examples, A bF B op is a\ndivision algebra, and he noted that a better question to ask is therefore whether\none could have Abi b B not a division algebra for all i, with A and B still having\nno common subfields. Mammone answered the question in [Mam92], producing\nexamples A bF B with A of degree n and B of degree n2 for any n. Then Jacob\nand Wadsworth [JW93, Th. 1] constructed examples of degree p for any odd prime\np, using valuation-theoretic methods. In [Kar99, Th. II.1], Karpenko produced an\nessentially different family of examples, also of equal odd prime degrees, using the\ntheory of the Chow group of Severi\u2013Brauer varieties.\nThe examples of [JW93] support an affirmative answer to Problem 9.2. In fact,\nthey involve symbol algebras A \u0010 pa, \u03bbqp and B \u0010 pc, d\u03bbqp of degree n \u0010 p over a\npower series field F :\u0010?k pp\u03bbqq, with a, c, d P k, and Abi b B \u0015 pai c, \u03bbqp b pc, dqp .\np\nThis has index p iff k p ai cq splits pc, dqp , which is the case if and only if pai c, \u03bbqp\nand pc, dqp have a common subfield.\nAs for Problem 9.3, it follows from Albert's and Risman's examples that if A is\na quaternion, B has degree 2n , and A b B is not a division algebra, then A and\nB have a common splitting field of degree less than or equal to 2n over F . The\nMammone, Jacob\u2013Wadsworth, and Karpenko examples showed that the Albert\nand Risman results could not be generalized in the obvious way; in particular\nany common splitting field of the degree p examples is divisible by p2 . However,\nKarpenko proceeded to generalize the Albert\u2013Risman results as follows. Let A be a\ncentral simple F -algebra of degree p, let B1 , . . . , Bp\u00011 be central simple F -algebras\nof degrees pn1 , . . . , pnp\u00011 , and let n \u0010 n1 \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 np\u00011 . Suppose that for every\ni \u0010 1, . . . , p \u0001 1, A bF Bi has zero divisors. Then there exists a field extension E {F\nof degree less than or equal to pn that splits all of the algebras A, B1 , . . . , Bp\u00011\n([Kar99, Th. 1.1]). In a similar vein, Krashen proved that if A1 , . . . , Apk are central\nsimple F -algebras of degrees pn for a prime p, and A1 bF \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 bF Apk has index\nk\npk , then the Ai are split by an \u00e9tale extension E {F of degree pnpp \u00011q m, where m\nis prime-to-p ([Kra10, Cor. 4.4]. Problems such as these are connected with the\nnotion of canonical dimension, see [Kar10] for a survey.\nAs noted above, Karpenko's examples made use of the seminal index reduction\nformula due to Schofield and Van den Bergh from [SvdB92]. Such formulas should\nplay a role in helping to resolve Problem 9.3, which is framed quite generally. For\nexample, there has been considerable recent interest in the special case: If A and\nB have the same splitting fields (chosen from some class of extension fields), then\nare A and B isomorphic? We address this in the next section.\n\n\fOPEN PROBLEMS ON CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS\n\n27\n\n10. Amitsur Conjecture\nAs a central simple F -algebra A is largely understood via the study of its splitting\nfields (see \u00a70), it is natural to try to determine exactly how much information about\nA is captured by its splitting fields alone.\nIn [Ami55], Amitsur constructed for any F -division algebra A a generic splitting\nfield F pAq, whose defining property is that a field extension L{F splits A if and\nonly if F pAq has a place in L (see [Bou88b, VI.2]). The first field of this type\nwas constructed by Witt in [Wit34], for quaternion algebras. Amitsur proved that\nhis F pAq is the function field of A's Severi-Brauer variety SB pAq, first studied\nby Chatelet in [Cha44]. Nowadays, the generic splitting field of a central simple\nalgebra is viewed as a special instance of the generic splitting field of a (reductive)\nalgebraic group, as described in [KR94]. Amitsur proved:\nTheorem 10.1. [Ami55, \u00a79] Let A and B be central simple F -algebras.\n(1) A and B have the same splitting fields if and only if A is Brauer-equivalent\nto B bi for some integer i relatively prime to the period of A.\n(2) If F pAq is isomorphic to F pB q, then A and B generate the same subgroup\nof the Brauer group.\nHe then posed the following converse of (2):\nConjecture 10.2 (Amitsur's Conjecture). If A and B have the same degree and\ngenerate the same subgroup of the Brauer group, then F pAq and F pB q are isomorphic.\nThe question was raised in [Ami55], and appears as Question 6 in [Ami82].\nBy definition, the generic splitting fields F pAq and F pB q are isomorphic if and\nonly if the Severi\u2013Brauer varieties SB pAq and SB pB q are F -birational. It is not\nhard to show that if A and B are as in the conjecture, then F pAq and F pB q are\nstably isomorphic.\nWhat is known. Amitsur was able to prove his conjecture in either the case where\nA has a maximal subfield that is cyclic Galois, or in the case where A is arbitrary\nand B is Aop [Ami55]. Roquette later extended these results to the case where\nA has a maximal subfield which is solvable Galois [Roq64]. Tregub, using very\ndifferent techniques, proved the result for A arbitrary of odd degree in the case\nwhere B is equivalent to Ab2 [Tre91]. Krashen generalized Roquette's results to\nthe case where A has a maximal subfield whose Galois closure is dihedral (hence\nquadratic over the maximal subfield), and also showed that the conjecture may be\nreduced to considering the case where every nontrivial subfield of A is a maximal\nsubfield [Kra03].\nTheorem 10.1(1) says that the splitting fields almost determine the algebra. But\nit may be too much to expect to know all of the splitting fields of a central simple\nalgebra, and so we will pose a finer problem. Note first that Theorem 10.1(2)\nsays that if algebras A and B have degree n, then the fields F pAq and F pB q have\ntranscendence degree n \u0001 1. It follows that if A and B have the same splitting fields\nn, then they generate the same subgroup of the Brauer\nof transcendence degree\ngroup. It is therefore natural to ask about splitting fields of smaller transcendence\ndegrees, or even finite splitting fields.\n\n\f28\n\nASHER AUEL, ERIC BRUSSEL, SKIP GARIBALDI, AND UZI VISHNE\n\nProblem 10.3. Determine whether two division algebras that have the same splitting fields in a given class (say finite, or of transcendence degree at most one),\nnecessarily generate the same subgroup in the Brauer group.\nThe smallest open case appears to be:\nProblem 10.4. Determine whether two division algebras of degree 3 that have the\nsame splitting fields of transcendence degree \u00a4 1 generate the same subgroup of\nthe Brauer group.\nIn the case of finite extensions, one has to be a bit more careful; one may easily\nconstruct examples of central simple algebras A and B over global fields which\nhave all the same finite splitting fields, but which do not generate the same cyclic\nsubgroup of the Brauer group [PR09, p. 149]. On the other hand, it is easy to\nshow that if A and B are quaternion algebras over a global field that have the same\ncollection of quadratic splitting fields, then A and B must be isomorphic. This\nmotivates the following.\nProblem 10.5. Show that if F is a field which is finitely generated over a prime\nfield or over an algebraically closed field, then any two quaternion division algebras\nhaving the same finite splitting fields (or even just the same maximal subfields)\nmust be isomorphic.\nWhat is known. Garibaldi and Saltman [GS10] showed that if F has trivial \"unramified Brauer group\" (in a sense including the archimedean places), then any two\nquaternion division algebras over F having the same maximal subfields must be\nisomorphic. Rapinchuk and Rapinchuk proved similar results for period 2 division\nalgebras in [RR09]. Krashen and McKinnie [KM10] showed that if quaternion algebras over F may be distinguished by their finite splitting fields, then the same is\ntrue over F pxq.\nFor algebras of higher degree, the situation for global fields leads one to the\nfollowing problem:\nProblem 10.6. Show that if F is a field which is finitely generated over a prime\nfield or over an algebraically closed field, and D is a division algebra, then there are\nonly finitely many other division algebras which share the same collection of finite\nsplitting fields.\nWhat is known. One may easily verify this for global fields. Krashen and McKinnie [KM10] showed that if this is true for a field F , it remains true for the field\nF pxq.\n11. Other problems\n11.A. Group admissibility and division algebras. Let F be a field and G a\nfinite group. We say G is F -admissible if there exists a G-crossed product F -division\nalgebra A.\nProblem 11.1. Determine which groups are F -admissible, for a field F .\nThis problem is an extension of the inverse Galois problem, and is especially\ninteresting for F \u0010 Q. It appears as part of Problem 5 in [Ami82].\nThe next problem, also known as the Q-admissibility conjecture, was first recognized in [Sch68].\nProblem 11.2. Prove every Sylow-metacyclic group is Q-admissible.\n\n\fOPEN PROBLEMS ON CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS\n\n29\n\nWhat is known. We discuss only the number field case of Problem 11.1. Schacher\ninitiated the study of admissibility in his thesis, where he proved that for any\nfinite group G there exists a number field F over which G is F -admissible ([Sch68,\nTh. 9.1]). His key observation was that if F is a global field, a group G is F admissible if and only if (a) G is the group for a Galois extension L{F , and (b) for\nevery prime p dividing |G|, there are two places v1 and v2 such that GalpLvi {Fvi q\ncontains a p-Sylow subgroup of G ([Sch68, Prop. 2.5]). It follows easily that a\nQ-admissible group is Sylow-metacyclic: every Sylow subgroup P of G contains a\nnormal subgroup H such that both H and P {H are cyclic ([Sch68, Th. 4.1]). This\nmotivated Problem 11.2.\nSchacher proved all Sylow-metacyclic abelian groups are Q-admissible in [Sch68,\nTh. 6.1], and Gordon\u2013Schacher proved that all metacyclic p-groups are Q-admissible\nin [GS79]. Liedahl extended this result to give necessary and sufficient conditions\non a pair pG, F q for G to be F -admissible, where G is a metacyclic p-group and F\nis a number field ([Lie96]). In 1983 Sonn settled Problem 11.2 for solvable groups,\nproving they are all Q-admissible in [Son83].\nTo help organize the work for nonsolvable groups we make the following observations. Schacher showed that Sn is Q-admissible if and only if n \u00a4 5 in [Sch68,\nTh. 7.1]. He showed that the alternating group An is not Q-admissible for n \u00a5 8 in\n[Sch68, Th. 7.4], but did not solve the problem for n \u0010 4, 5, 6, and 7, though Gordon\nand Schacher proved A4 \u0010 PSLp2, 3q is Q-admissible in [GS77]. Schacher also noted\nthat the groups PSLp2, pq, which are simple for p \u00a5 5, are Sylow-metacyclic for p\na prime, making them a natural target for attempts at Problem 11.2. Chillag and\nSonn noted that the central extensions SLp2, pn q of PSLp2, pn q are Sylow-metacyclic\nfor n \u00a4 2 and p \u00a5 5, and that a nonabelian finite simple Sylow-metacyclic group belongs to the set tA7 , M11 , PSLp2, pn q for n \u00a4 2 and pn \u0018 2, 3u ([CS81, Lemma 1.5]).\nIn 1993, Fein\u2013Saltman\u2013Schacher proved that any finite Sylow-metacyclic group that\nappears as a Galois group over Q is Qptq-admissible ([FSS93]).\nHere is a list of known non-solvable Q-admissible groups and the papers in which\nthe results appear: A5 \u0010 PSLp2, 4q \u0010 PSLp2, 5q ([GS79]); A6 \u0010 PSLp2, 9q and\nA7 , ([FV87], [SS92]); SLp2, 5q, ([FF90]); the double covers \u00c36 \u0010 SLp2, 9q and \u00c37 ,\n([Fei94]); PSLp2, 7q and PSLp2, 11q, ([AS01]); and SLp2, 11q, ([Fei02]). In some\ncases, these groups are known to be F -admissible in more general circumstances.\nFor example,\nthe condition \"2 has at least two prime divisors in F or F does not con?\ntain \u00011\" is necessary and sufficient for the F -admissibility of the groups SLp2, 5q,\n([FF90]); A6 and A7 ([SS92]), and PSLp2, 7q, ([AS01]). Feit proved PSLp2, 11q is\nF -admissible over all number fields in [Fei04]. Problem 11.2 for PSLp2, 13q remains\nopen.\nInterestingly, an analog of the Q-admissibility conjecture was recently proved\nby Harbater, Hartmann, and Krashen for the function field of a curve over a discretely valued field with algebraically closed residue field, using patching machinery\n([HHKar]).\n\n11.B. SK1 of central simple algebras. For a central simple F -algebra A, write\nSL1 pAqpF q for the elements of A with reduced norm 1 and\nSK1 pAq :\u0010 SL1 pAqpF q{rA\u0002 , A\u0002 s.\n\n\f30\n\nASHER AUEL, ERIC BRUSSEL, SKIP GARIBALDI, AND UZI VISHNE\n\nThis group depends only on the Brauer class of A [Dra83, p. 160]. If A is not\ndivision, then SK1 pAq is the Whitehead group of the linear algebraic group SL1 pAq\nappearing in the Kneser\u2013Tits Problem, see [Tit78] and [Gil09].\nThe basic question is: What is this group? It is always abelian (obviously) and\ntorsion with period dividing the index of A [Dra83, p. 157, Lemma 2]. It was for\na long time an open question (called the Tannaka\u2013Artin Problem) whether it is\nalways zero. For example, Wang proved in [Wan50] that it is zero if the index of\nA is square-free. Then in [Pla75], Platonov exhibited a biquaternion algebra with\nnonzero SK1 ; re-worked versions of this example can be found also in [KMRT98] and\n[Dra83, \u00a724]. Moreover, every countable abelian torsion group of finite exponent-\ne.g., a finite abelian group-is SK1 pAq for some algebra A over some field.\nOne can also consider SK1 simultaneously over all extensions of F , which is\nconnected with the structure of SLr pAq as a variety:\nTheorem 11.3. For a central simple F -algebra A, SK1 pA b Lq \u0010 0 for every\nextension L{F if and only if SLr pAq is retract rational for every (resp., some)\nr \u00a5 2.\n\nThe \"if\" direction can be found in [Vos98, p. 186]. The full theorem amounts to\ncombining the results from ibid. with [Gil09, Th. 5.9]. Gille's theorem furthermore\nshows that the conditions are equivalent to the abstract group SLr pAqpLq being\n\"projectively simple\" for every extension L{F and every r \u00a5 2.\nThe main problem from this point of view is to prove the following converse to\nWang's result:\nConjecture 11.4 (Suslin [Sus91, p. 75]). If SK1 pA b Lq\nL{F , then the index of A is square-free.\n\n\u0010 0 for every extension\n\nThe main known result on this conjecture is due to Merkurjev in [Mer93] and\n[Mer06]: If 4 divides the index of A, then SK1 pA b Lq \u0018 0 for some L{F .\n11.C. Relative Brauer groups. Let F be a field with nontrivial Brauer group.\nWhich subgroups of the Brauer group of F are algebraic relative Brauer groups; i.e.,\nof the form BrpK {F q for some algebraic field extension K of F ? Which subgroups of\nthe Brauer group of F are abelian relative Brauer groups; i.e., of the form BrpK {F q\nfor some abelian field extension K of F ?\nIn particular, if n \u00a1 1 when is the n-torsion subgroup nBrpF q of BrpF q an\nalgebraic (resp. abelian) relative Brauer group?\nIt is conjectured that if F is finitely generated (and infinite), then nBrpF q is an\nabelian relative Brauer group for all n if and only if F is a global field.\nWhat is known. If F is a global field, then nBrpF q is an abelian relative Brauer\ngroup for all n ([KS03]; [Pop05]; [KS06]). The conjecture above is that the converse\nholds. So far the following is known [PSW07]: if l is a prime different from the\ncharacteristic of F and F contains the l2 roots of unity, then the conjecture holds\nfor n \u0010 l, i.e., there is no abelian extension K {F such that lBrpF q \u0010 BrpK {F q.\n11.D. The Brumer\u2013Rosen Conjecture. Amongst the first examples one sees,\nprobably the fields R or iterated Laurent series Rppx1 qqppx2 qq \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 ppxn qq are the only\nones whose Brauer group is nonzero and finite. This leads to the following naive\nquestion:\n\n\fOPEN PROBLEMS ON CENTRAL SIMPLE ALGEBRAS\n\n31\n\nProblem 11.5. For which natural numbers n is there a field F such that |BrpF q| \u0010\nn?\nFein and Schacher [FS76] noted that every power of 2 can occur. The following,\nfiner conjecture would imply that these are the only possibilities. Specifically, for\nany field F , we can decompose Br F into a direct sum of its p-primary components\npBr F qp and ask if the following holds:\nConjecture 11.6 (Brumer\u2013Rosen [BR68]). For a given field F and each prime p,\none of the following holds:\n(a) pBr F qp \u0010 0.\n(b) pBr F qp contains a nonzero divisible subgroup.\n(c) p \u0010 2 and pBr F q2 is an elementary abelian 2-group.\nSome remarks:\n(1) In contrast with the case for fields covered by this conjecture, every finite\nabelian group can be obtained as the Brauer group of some commutative\nring [For81].\n(2) Every divisible torsion abelian group is the Brauer group of some field,\nsee [Mer85]. (Interestingly, this note does not appear in MathSciNet, is\nnot listed in the journal's table of contents, and has apparently not been\ntranslated into English.)\n(3) pBr F q2 is an elementary abelian 2-group if and only if the cup product\n2\nmap ? \u0004 p\u00011q : H2 pF, \u03bc2 q\u00d1H3 pF, \u03bcb\n2 q is an injection [LLT93, Cor. A4].\n\"Many\" cases of the conjecture are known:\nif p \u0010 char F . In this case, pBr F qp is p-divisible by Witt's Theorem [Dra83,\np. 110].\nif p \u0010 2 or 3. These are Theorem 3 and Corollary 2 in [Mer83].\nif p is odd and there is a division algebra of degree p that is cyclic. This is\nTheorem 2 in [Mer83]. This gives a connection between the Brumer\u2013Rosen\nConjecture and Problems 1.1 and 3.1.\nif p \u0010 5 or F contains a primitive p-th root of unity. These follow from the\nprevious bullet, because in these cases the p-torsion in Br F is generated by\ncyclic algebras of degree p.\nClearly, Merkurjev has largely settled the conjecture, in the same sense that the\nMerkurjev\u2013Suslin Theorem settled a large portion of Problem 3.1 on generation by\ncyclic algebras. The smallest open case is p \u0010 7, and this case would be settled by\na \"yes\" answer to Problem 3.2. Does there exist a field with Brauer group Z{7?\nWe remark that Fein and Schacher's main result in [FS76] was that \"many\" of\nthe possibilities predicted by Brumer\u2013Rosen actually occur: every countable abelian\ntorsion group of the form D ` V for D divisible and V a vector space over F2 occurs\nas the Brauer group of some algebraic extension of Q. Efrat [Efr97] gives general\ncriteria on the field F for pBr F q2 to be finite and nonzero.\n11.E. Invariants of central simple algebras. Once one is interested in central\nsimple F -algebras of degree n-equivalently, elements of H1 pF, PGLn q-it is natural\nto want to know the invariants of PGLn in the sense of [GMS03] with values in, say,\nmod-2 Galois cohomology Hi p\u0001, Z{2Zq or the Witt ring W p\u0001q. (In this subsection,\nwe assume for simplicity that the characteristic of F does not divide 2n.)\n\n\f32\n\nASHER AUEL, ERIC BRUSSEL, SKIP GARIBALDI, AND UZI VISHNE\n\nNote that this problem is related to Problem 5.1: If PGLn has a non-constant\ninvariant that is unramified in the sense of [GMS03, p. 87], then the center of generic\nmatrices Z pF, nq from \u00a75 is not a rational extension of F , see ibid., p. 87. There are\nno nonconstant unramified invariants with values in Hi p\u0001, Gm q for i \u00a4 3 by [Sal85]\n(for i \u0010 2) and [Sal97b] (for i \u0010 3).\nThis problem is also related to essential dimension as in \u00a76, because cohomological invariants provide lower bounds on essential dimension. Specifically: If F\nis algebraically closed and there is a nonzero invariant H1 p\u0001, PGLn q\u00d1Hi p\u0001, C q for\nsome finite Galois module C, then edpPGLn q \u00a5 i by [GMS03, p. 32].\nWhat is known. The case n \u0010 2 concerns quaternion algebras and the invariants are determined in [GMS03, pp. 43, 66]. For n an odd prime, there are no\nnonconstant Witt invariants (for trivial reasons) and the mod-n cohomological invariants are linear combinations of constants and the connecting homomorphism\nH1 p\u0001, PGLn q \u00d1 H2 p\u0001, \u03bcn q, see [Gar09a, 6.1].\nThe case n \u0010 4 is substantial, but solved. Rost\u2013Serre\u2013Tignol [RST06] construct\ninvariants of algebras of degree 4, including one that detects whether an algebra\nis cyclic. (See [Tig06] for analogous results in characteristic 2.) Rost proved that,\nroughly speaking, the invariants from [RST06] generate all cohomological invariants\nof algebras of degree 4-see [Bae10, \u00a73.4] for details.\nThe next interesting case is n \u0010 8. Here, Baek\u2013Merkurjev [BM09] solve the\nsubproblem of determining the invariants of algebras of degree 8 and period 2, i.e.,\nof GL8 {\u03bc2 . Beyond this, not much is known.\nReferences\n[AJ09]\n[Alb32]\n[Alb33]\n[Alb34]\n[Alb36]\n[Alb38]\n[Alb61]\n[Ami55]\n[Ami72]\n[Ami82]\n\n[ART79]\n[Art82]\n\n[AS78]\n\nR. Aravire and B.
