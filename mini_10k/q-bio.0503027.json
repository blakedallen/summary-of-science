This model was built for three separate SH3 domains using experimental \u03c6values as structural constraints in all-atom protein folding simulations. While averaging\nover all conformations incorrectly considers non-TS conformations as transition states,\nquantifying structures as pre-TS, TS, and post-TS by measurement of their transmission\ncoefficient (\"probability to fold\", or pfold) allows for rigorous conclusions regarding the\nstructure of the folding nucleus and a full mechanistic analysis of the folding process.\nThrough analysis of the TS, we observe a highly polarized nucleus in which many\nresidues are solvent-exposed. Mechanistic analysis suggests the hydrophobic core forms\nlargely after an early nucleation step. SH3 presents an ideal system for studying the\nnucleation-condensation mechanism and highlights the synergistic relationship between\nexperiment and simulation in the study of protein folding.\n\n\f3 of 31\n\nCurrent understanding of the protein folding process is largely based on the theory of\nnucleation1,2 and energy landscape theory3. For the majority of small proteins, which\nserve as model systems for studying protein folding, the process occurs via a two-state\nmechanism4. In analogy to a first order phase transition, the folded and unfolded states\nmay be thought of as different phases (i.e. liquid and gas) and the transition state (TS) as\nthe \"critical nucleus\" that seeds the transition5. Since the kinetics of the transformation\nbetween the thermodynamically stable folded and unfolded states is determined by the\nTS, understanding this state allows for a deeper understanding of the rate and mechanism\nof folding. The folding process may also be thought of statistically with the formation of\na transition state ensemble (TSE) as the rate limiting process in folding5. Experiments,\nmainly based on the protein engineering method of \"\u03c6-value analysis\"6, have made\nsignificant progress in testing theories of folding. Concurrently, theory and simulation\nhave continued to improve our understanding of the nature of nucleation in the TSE7.\nA prototypical example of the interplay between theory and experiment is the\nstructural interpretation of experimental \u03c6-values through simulation8,9. This method for\nreconstructing a protein's TSE from experimental constraints has proven highly useful in\nunderstanding folding, especially as it was refined to test the assumption that a set of\nstructures meeting experimental constraints is, in fact, a TSE10,11. A TS is characterized\nby a transmission coefficient of 1/2. In proteins, this corresponds to a probability of\nfolding, or \"pfold\"5 equal to one half. Verifying this condition prior to making statements\nregarding computational models of the TSE is absolutely essential as it has been shown\nthat an ensemble of structures meeting a set of \u03c6-value restraints is not composed entirely\nof TS conformations11,12. Once a model of the TSE is obtained, it is possible to conduct\n\n\f4 of 31\nanalyses that are currently impossible by experiment, such as exploring the role of\nresidues for which mutation does not cause sufficient destabilization and building an\natom-level structural model of the TSE.\nSH3 is a widely studied protein that exhibits two-state folding, and is composed of\ntwo orthogonally packed three-stranded \u03b2-sheets that form a single hydrophobic core13.\nSH3 domains have served as the experimental13,14 and computational15-18\n\nmodel for\n\nnumerous recent studies of nucleation in protein folding. Although there have been\nsimulations that attempted to reconstruct the TSE using \u03c6-values17,18, the essential step of\ntesting the assumption that the resulting structures are transition states was not\nnecessarily taken18. As it has been shown that not all conformations consistent with\nexperimental \u03c6-values are members of the TSE, it is difficult to accurately interpret these\nconclusions regarding nucleation and the TSE. In the following study we use the src, fyn,\nand spectrin SH3 domain and reported experimental \u03c6-values19 as a model systems to\nstudy the nature of nucleation in the protein folding transition state. Importantly, pfold\nanalysis is used to quantify the position of each structure along the folding pathway. We\nalso examine the role and formation of the hydrophobic core and explore the order of\nfolding events in this classic nucleation-condensation mechanism. In SH3, nucleation is\nearly and separate from hydrophobic core formation. The early, polarized TS that we\nobserve is largely solvent-exposed and is formed by a minimal number of contacts.\n\nResults.\nA Model of the TSE. A side-by-side comparison of the native and transition state is\npresented in Figure 1.\n\nThe general features of all observed SH3 TSEs include\n\n\f5 of 31\ndenaturation of the N- and C-termi, turns and loops, and a small amount of secondary\nstructures located in the central \u03b2 strands. The TSE for the three different SH3 domains\nexhibit average C\u03b1 root mean square deviation (RMSD) ranging from 7.1 to 11.4 \u00c5 and\nradii of gyration (Rg) of 12.5 to 14.53\u00c5, which is largely expanded compared to the ~10\n\u00c5 Rg of the native conformations. The high RSMD is largely a result of unfolding of the\nN- and C-terminal strands as well as the expansion of the hydrophobic core. The fraction\nof native contacts (Q) ranges from 0.17 in src and spectrin to 0.27 in fyn. By any\nmeasure, we observe a TSE in all three domains that occurs early in folding. This implies\nmuch less structure than has been observed in streptococcal protein G11 and ribosomal\nprotein S612. The properties of the pre-TS, TS, and post-TS ensembles for three SH3\ndomains are summarized in Table 1.\nThe picture of a TSE that lacks much of the long range interactions found in the\nnative state is consistent with experimental evidence of similarities between the\ndenatured state and folding transition state of the SH3 domain20. Our results suggest an\nearly TS, resembling the unfolded ensemble more than the native state, with a small\namount of structure (specific nucleus) focused on the central \u03b2 strands and the majority of\nthe hydrophobic core unformed. Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) studies have\nalso suggested an early TSE with a solvated hydrophobic core21. To substantiate and\nunderstand the details of the observed diffuse polarized TSE it is essential to identify the\nspecific residues around which the polarized nucleus is organized. Also, it is important to\nunderstand the extent to which hydrophobic core formation makes its enthalpic\ncontribution before, during, or after nucleation and, if it is not formed, the extent to which\n\n\f6 of 31\nit is exposed to solvent. After understanding the central event of nucleation, we describe\nthe mechanism by which it is formed and how folding proceeds to the native state.\n\nA distinct network of nucleating contacts. As expected, in each domain the high \u03c6value residues that were constrained in simulation generally exhibit a high Q and number\nof native contacts (N). These high \u03c6-value residues, which are experimentally known to\nplay an important role in the TSE, allowed us to effectively sample pfold = 1/2 structures.\nHowever, they do not uniquely define the TSE. The independently determined and pfold\nverified TSE of each of the three studied SH3 domains, despite minor differences, exhibit\nfundamentally similar topology. Figure 2 illustrates the number of contacts made by each\nresidue in the TSE and native states as well as the location of restrained residues, which\nvaried from domain to domain. While most residues make few, if any contacts, a subset\nof residues confined to a small region of the protein define the TSE. This polarization of\nstructure is characteristic of a classic nucleation mechanism. More important than the\nnumber of contacts made by each residue is the information regarding how those contacts\nare made. In each of the domains, the RT loop, turn/\u03b22, \u03b23, and distal hairpin regions\nform a network of tertiary interactions. The contact maps of the native and transition\nstates, presented in Figure 3, illustrates this network of contacts and the specific tertiary\nstructural elements that define the native and transition states.\nResidues that were restrained in construction of the src TSE due to their high \u03c6values include E30 and L32 in the diverging turn/\u03b22 regions as well as L44, S47, L48,\nT50, Q52, T53, Y55, and I56, which span the \u03b23-\u03b24 hairpin19. In the fyn domain F4 in\n\u03b21; F20, E24, and I28 in the RT/turn/\u03b22 region; and T44, G45, I50, and V55 in the\n\n\f7 of 31\n\u03b23/hairpin/\u03b24 region were restrained 22,23. In spectrin the \u03c6-values of V23, T24, and D29\nin the RT/ turn/\u03b22 region; K43 and V44 in \u03b23; and F52, V53, and V58 in \u03b24/\u03b25 were\nused24. Although necessary, the contacts of the restrained residues do not alone define\nthe TSE, as demonstrated through pfold analysis. The fact that even the set of all available\nrestraints does not uniquely define a TSE is also observed in other proteins11,12. In SH3,\nwe find that additional restraints do not significantly improve TSE sampling, whereas\nusing fewer restraints results in largely unfolded, low pfold, ensembles.\n\nThen, by\n\ndefinition, the specific nucleus is composed of the network of contacts formed in each\ndomain by the above residues, including contacts made to residues outside this set in pfold\n= 1/2 conformations.\nFrom Figure 2, it is clear that a number of unconstrained residues also play a role\nin the TSE. There is a small amount of structure in the RT loop centered on residues near\nthe diverging turn. L24 (numbering from the src domain) is a highly conserved position\nin the SH3 fold family25 and has been shown experimentally to be at least partially\ninvolved in the TSE26 despite its relatively low \u03c6-value and also appears to play an\nimportant role in the fyn and spectrin domains. The n-src loop has some native structure\naround Q33 and I34 near \u03b22, as well as D41, which leads into \u03b23. None of these residues\nhave reported \u03c6-values. The same effect is seen in the fyn and spectrin domain, where\nthe n-src loop region is unstructured. Simulation provides key insight into the structure\nof the n-src loop in the TSE, since most experimental data on this region is difficult to\ninterpret19. In the \u03b23/distal hairpin region, W43 and A45, both highly conserved in SH3,\nmake a number of important contacts in the TSE. W43 has no \u03c6-value and A45 has a\ndifficult to interpret \u03c6 = 1.20. Residue G51, which is also highly conserved across\n\n\f8 of 31\ndifferent SH3 domains27, exhibits high Q but very low values of N. Its important role is\nalso suggested by an experimental \u03c6 = 1.0619 as well as other recent, independent\nmutagenic experiments27.\nThrough the preceding analysis, it is clear that the structure of the TSE, common\nto all domains, is formed by a small number of residues in the \u03b22-\u03b23 hairpin making nonlocal contacts to the RT loop/diverging turn and distal \u03b2-hairpin regions. The nucleus\nresidues common to all three domains include L24, F26, E30, L32, W43, L44, A45, H46,\nand G51 (numbering corresponds to the src domain, see Supplemental Figure 1 for an\nalternative presentation of the data). This agrees with experimental results indicating that\nthe second, third, and to a lesser extent the fourth \u03b2 strands are the most ordered regions\nof the TSE19; however, we are able to go beyond this qualitative description to understand\nhow the contacts are being made (Figure 3). The importance of this network of tertiary\ncontacts in the SH3 TSE has also been observed in simplified model simulations28. It is\ninteresting to note that the folding nucleus is not simply composed of large hydrophobic\nresidues as one might naively assume. In fact many such residues belong to \"unfolded\"\nregions in the TSE. The network of contacts formed by the specific nucleus described\nabove is the necessary and sufficient condition for reaching the TSE. It is noteworthy\nthat simply averaging over all conformations consistent with experimental restraints\nyields a misleading picture of a TSE that is largely defined as a distorted/partially formed\nnative state topology, a claim that has been made previously in SH318.\n\nAccurate\n\ncharacterization of the true TSE is only possible through the implementation of pfold\nanalysis, which allows for the discrimination and separate analysis of pre-TS, TS, and\npost-TS conformations.\n\n\f9 of 31\n\nSolvent accessibility in the TSE. Many experimental29,30 and theoretical21,31 studies have\nused SH3 domains to explore and understand the role of solvent in protein folding. Since\nthe Go model does not explicitly represent solvent, we examine solvent accessibility in\nthe TSE rather than the mechanistic role of individual water molecules.\n\nFigure 4\n\nsummarizes the change in solvent accessibility for each residue between the native and\ntransition states for three SH3 domains. The N- and C-terminal strands are both very\nsolvent exposed, indicating their largely denatured conformation in the TSE. This may\nalso be inferred from Figure 2, which shows how few contacts these residues make.\nMore striking than the solvent exposure of these residues, is the fact that the most\nexposed residues in the first \u03b2 strand and beginning of the RT-loop, and the residues from\nthe end of \u03b24 through the 310 helix and \u03b25 are largely non-polar and hydrophobic. The\nsame trend of exposed hydrophobic residues is observed in the n-src loop and beginning\nof the \u03b23 strand. This observation is consistent across three different SH3 domains.\nAs described above, full formation of the hydrophobic core is not necessary for\nreaching the TSE. The ordering of water molecules around these hydrophobic residues\ncreates an entropic penalty that is relieved upon desolvation. Thus, desolvation in the\npolymer compaction subsequent to the transition barrier, may mitigate the entropic cost\nof polymer collapse. This, coupled with the energy of the eventual hydrophobic contact\nformation, could help ensure that subsequent folding is rapid and highly energetically\nfavorable. It has been suggested that these residues may be involved in non-native or\nnon-specific hydrophobic interactions29. Since a strict Go potential treats non-native\ncontacts as destabilizing, we were concerned that such a model could skew any test of\n\n\f10 of 31\nthis hypothesis. As such, we also performed pfold analysis with an alternative potential\nthat does not count all non-native interactions as repulsive and which includes attractive\nnon-native interaction. This generalization of the model did not alter the basic result;\nboth with and without non-native interactions, our simulations suggest that such nonspecific hydrophobic stabilization is necessary neither for nucleation nor rapid folding.\nAlthough negative experimental \u03c6-values are sometimes interpreted as indicating nonnative interactions or parallel folding pathways32, nearly all residues in the hydrophobic\ncore have positive \u03c6-values. Our model also suggests that the energetic contribution of\nhydrophobic core formation comes only after the transition barrier.\nThe other major, though less pronounced, region of increased solvent accessibility\nin the TSE spans the RT-loop into the diverging turn and \u03b22 strand. This group of\nresidues is different from the one discussed above in that they are predominantly polar or\ncharged. If hydrophilic residues are exposed in the TSE, then solvation of these residues\nmay provide non-specific stabilization, accelerating folding.\n\nThis interpretation is\n\nconsistent with the early barrier observed independently in earlier, explicit solvent MD\nmodels that seek to determine the TSE from unfolding21. Other simple models have also\nsuggested the important role of solvent in SH3 folding33.\n\nFrom our simulations, it\n\nappears that a fully formed hydrophobic core is not necessary for traversing the transition\nbarrier in SH3. In fact, the solvent exposure of these core residues may play an important\nrole in promoting folding past the TSE by affecting the energetic balance between\ndesolvation, configurational entropy loss, and hydrophobic contact formation.\n\n\f11 of 31\nMechanistic insights. It was previously demonstrated that the order of events in protein\nfolding may be reliably inferred from examination of structures that precede and follow\nthe TSE along the folding pathway12. Figure 3 (right column) shows the contacts present\nin the pre- (but not post-) TSE and post- (but not pre-) TSE structures. Double mutant\nexperiments show that the distal hairpin is mostly formed in the TS14 and there is some\nindication that is begins to form prior to the TSE in all three domains. The minute\namount of tertiary structure present before the transition state occurs is greatly fluctuating\nand varies between the different domains, which is consistent with an early TSE.\nConversely, there are a large number of structural features common to the TSE of each\ndomain.\n\nDespite minor differences, the common behavior we observe between all\n\nstudied SH3 domains is the formations of the turn-RT loop, \u03b21-\u03b22, \u03b22-\u03b23, and \u03b23-\u03b24\nmotifs immediately after the TSE.\n\nContacts between the \u03b22 and \u03b23 strands begin\n\nforming around the transition region to various degrees, but form largely after nucleation.\nCross linking experiments have also suggested that the N- and C-termini and RT loop\nform after the rate limiting step14. This behavior is also observed in our simulation with a\nslight exception in spectrin, which exhibits contacts between the 310 helix region and \u03b21\nin the TSE. The n-src loop is anchored by \u03b22 and minimally solvent-exposed in the TSE,\nbut appears to adopt a native conformation late in SH3 folding.\n\nA classic nucleation-condensation mechanism. Through simulation, we observe that\nSH3 folding proceeds via a classic nucleation-condensation mechanism. A small number\nof non-local contacts form the specific nucleus. Though some previous studies focused\non the \u03b22-\u03b23-\u03b24 sheet as the defining characteristic of the TSE17, we observe that tertiary\n\n\f12 of 31\ncontacts involving the RT-loop, turn/\u03b22, \u03b23 region, and the distal hairpin characterize pfold\n= 1/2 conformations. The importance of tertiary contacts in SH3 domain transition states\nhas previously been observed in simplified model simulations16. However, some of the\nresidues they identify such as A12 (\u03c6 = 0.05) and G54 (\u03c6 = -0.08) do not appear to play a\nmajor role in the nucleation. This highlights the advantages inherent in the increased\nresolution of an all-atom model over a more coarse grained C\u03b1/C\u03b2 protein representation.\nOne computational study suggested that the \u03b22-\u03b23-\u03b24 sheet is fully hydrogen bonded\nwith little other structure in the TSE and that folding occurs through a diffusion-collision\nlike model of sheet formation, followed by a separate sandwiching event and expulsion of\nwater from the core21. In contrast, we observe the RT loop, turn-\u03b22 motif, \u03b23 strand, and\nthe distal \u03b2-hairpin involved in a network of non-local tertiary contacts forming the site\nof nucleation.\nOur results are consistent across experiments on several different SH3 domains\nand with independent simulations that suggest that the distal hairpin and loop are ordered\nin the SH3 TSE, while the rest of the protein is largely disordered15. Experiments in \u03b1spectin SH3 have also shown that loop stiffness is important for restricting structural\nheterogeneity in the TSE34. The nucleus is distinct from the hydrophobic core, which is\nmainly unformed and solvent-exposed in the TSE34. The nucleus occurs in an early,\npolarized TSE that requires relatively few native contacts. The robustness of folding to\nenvironmental changes is evidenced in experiments that show that nucleation is\nunaffected even by large changes in pH24. It has also been observed in the D48G mutant\nof \u03b1-spectrin domain that the protein melts over a 20\u00b0 range35. One rationalization for\nthis observation, may be that since hydrophobic core formation it separate from\n\n\f13 of 31\nnucleation, the non-cooperative \"melting\" of these contacts broadens the transition. The\nhighly cooperative behavior of the SH3 domain13, and the observed consistency of\nfolding mechanism despite drastic changes in experimental conditions, may be attributed\nto the early, polarized TSE formation by a minimal number of contacts. These data\nprovide an atomic-level description of a conformationally restricted folding transition\nstate in which a small region (the RT loop, \u03b23, \u03b23-\u03b24 hairpin and its contacts to \u03b22 and\nthe diverging turn, a network formed largely by L24, F26, E30, L32, W43, L44, A45,\nH46, and G51) is the center of nucleation and in which the rest of the protein, including\nresidues involved in the hydrophobic core, is largely disordered24. We observe that\nnucleation comes before, and is separate from, hydrophobic collapse. Simple models\nhave also suggested that formation of the hydrophobic core may occur separately, and\nwithin a distinct timescale, from structural collapse to a \"near native intermediate\"33. The\nearly nucleation we observe is the rate-limiting step and is distinct from the late nativelike structures found by others; what they refer to is not nucleation, but a separate\ndesolvation step30,31. MD models with explicit solvent also suggest that core formation\nand packing come after \u03b2-sheet formation21. This separation of timescales may also be\nexplained as resulting from the kinetically distinct phase of side chain relaxation that\nfollows nucleation and collapse36.\n\nDiscussion.\nWe have presented a pfold verified, all-atom model of the TSE in three different SH3\ndomains. This allows for rigorous conclusions regarding the nature and mechanism of\nnucleation. In constructing the TSE, residues were restrained, but the way in which the\n\n\f14 of 31\nminimal set of restraints was met (contacts between residues) was not predetermined.\nImportantly, the true TSE was identified through (unconstrained) pfold analysis. It is\nnoteworthy that the set of available \u03c6-values for SH3, and other proteins, is insufficient to\nuniquely specify the TSE. One recent study reports an unverified TSE constructed from\n\n\u03c6-values in which ensembles produced under different unfolding conditions have\nvirtually non-overlapping RMSD/Rg distributions18. Another study acknowledged the\npresence of \"false positive TSE structures\", but relied on manual selection of structures\nsuch that their model TSE was in agreement with presumed general features such as a\nformed \u03b22-\u03b23-\u03b24 sheet17. In the absence of a quantitative measure, it is impossible to\nreliably recognize the transition state. However, with a suitable proxy for the transition\ncoordinate such as pfold5, it is possible to identify the distinct structural characteristics of\nthe TSE and other stages along the folding pathway.\nFrom these data we conclude that SH3 folds via a classic nucleation-condensation\nmechanism with a highly polarized nucleus that forms early along the reaction pathway,\nwhich helps explain the experimentally observed highly cooperative folding of SH313. In\nthis early TSE many residues (both hydrophobic and hydrophilic) are solvent-exposed.\nHydrophobic collapse is separate from, and subsequent to, nucleation. In this sense SH3\nis the paradigm for the nature and implication of a pure nucleation-condensation protein\nfolding mechanism. While experimental \u03c6-values are invaluable in helping to identify\nresidues of importance in folding, simulation allows for deeper interpretation by\ndetermining the identity of residues and network of contacts that form the specific\nnucleus. In this manner, kinetic \u03c6-values are structurally interpreted as a completely\ninteracting set of data in the context of a 3D protein structure. We believe that similar\n\n\f15 of 31\nstudies, in which computer simulations are utilized to interpret experimental data, will\nplay an increasingly important role in understanding protein folding.\n\nModel and Methods\nConstructing and verifying the TSE. Simulations were initiated using coordinates from\nthe crystal structures of the src-SH3 of tyrosine kinase37 (1FMK), fyn-SH322,23 (1FYN),\nand \u03b1-spectrin SH324 domains (1BK2).. The simulation was propagated by Monte Carlo\ndynamics using a move set that included rotations of backbone (\u03c6-\u03c8) angles and\nsidechain (\u03c7) torsion angles, while maintaining planar peptide bonds. All non-hydrogen\natoms are represented as impenetrable hard spheres38,39 and excluded volume is\ncontinually enforced. Energy was provided by a square-well Go potential since these\nmodels faithfully represent many of the important features of the protein folding\nlandscape in a computationally efficient manner40. As in experiment13, our model of SH3\nexhibits clear two-state unfolding without intermediates.\n\nThe thermodynamics and\n\nkinetics of this model (potential, move set, and protein representation) have been\nextensively studied in crambin38, protein G11,39, CI210, and S612, successfully folding these\nproteins from random coil to <1\u00c5 C\u03b1 RMS.\nThe SH3 folding mechanism is largely determined by native state topology, with\nnonnative interactions playing a relatively small role13; thus the native-centric Go model\nis especially well suited for its study. Use of the Go model is also motivated by rigorous\ntheoretical and experimental studies showing that the TS is robust with respect to the\nselection of sequences folding into a particular structure and potentials used to design and\nfold sequences41-43. Go models have been applied to the prediction of folding rates and\n\n\f16 of 31\nthe interpretation and prediction of \u03c6-values44-46. Since there is no general physics-based\n(CHARMM-like) potential for fully folding \u03b1/\u03b2 from random coil, the topologicallybased and computationally efficient Go potential is currently the ideal candidate40 for\nprotein folding studies such as these. It was recently demonstrated that Go models\ncompare favorably with empirical potentials, especially in representing the interaction\nenergies of individual residues and in interpreting \u03c6-values47.A putative ensemble of TS\nconformations was constructed through restrained unfolding simulations, and pfold\ndetermined for each member in order to verify if a given structure is a TS, as earlier\ndescribed11,12. Experimental \u03c6-values (\u03c6exp) were interpreted as the fraction of native\ncontacts made by a given residue in the TSE (\u03c6sim):\n\n\" isim =\n\nN iTSE\n(1)\nN iNative\n\nand implemented as structural restraints in unfolding simulations by use of a simple\n\n!\nharmonic potential for restrained\nresidues:\nE Total = E Go + E \"\nN\n\n= E Go + # \u2022 % (\" isim $ \" iexp ) 2\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\nIt is intuitively and desirable to use the minimal number of restraints necessary to\n!\nconstruct the putative\nTSE (none are used in pfold simulation) and to choose those\n\nrestraints such that most straightforwardly interpretable. To this end, we exclude \u03c6 > 1\nand \u03c6 < 0 (which may indicate native contacts, non-native contacts, or alternative folding\npathways). These experimental values are without doubt meaningful, however ambiguity\nin their interpretation and the fact that they are not necessary to construct the TSE argue\nconvincingly for their exclusion. Previously published experimental \u03c6-values19,22-24 were\n\n\f17 of 31\nused as a source of restraints. For src-SH3, we chose the 10 highest \u03c6-values after\nexcluding all \u03c6 > 1 and V35, which is in a cluster of six residues for which mutation\nyielded unclear results. Both fyn and spectrin, exhibited 8 classical, unambiguous values.\nIn the highly multi-dimensional energy landscape of protein folding, it is difficult\nto define a reaction coordinate or progress variable by which to gauge the evolution of\nthe folding reaction. Several practical solutions to this problem have been proposed48,49.\nWe choose to apply pfold analysis which, with firm grounding in theory and simulation48,\ndefines a measurable universal property of chemical systems that may serve as a progress\nvariable. By definition, a system that exhibits a pfold = 1/2 is a TS. The adaptation of pfold\nanalysis to protein models systems has been detailed previously38.\n\nWe initiate 100\n\nindependent restrained unfolding simulations were initiated from the src-SH3 native\ncoordinates. 50 unfolding runs each were conducted for the fyn and spectrin domains.\nUnfolding trajectories were run at T = 2.5 \u2248 Tf (4 for spectrin). Each independent\nunfolding simulation was followed by 20 unrestrained refolding runs to determine pfold,\nRefolding simulations were run under stabilizing conditions at T = 1, to observe rapid\nrefolding of structures that have passed the transition barrier.\n\nThe criteria for\n\ncommitment to folding were derived from the distribution of values of the equilibrium\nensemble at the refolding T (E < -425, N > 425, DRMS < 2.5 \u00c5). The TSE includes\nstructures with 0.4 \u2264 pfold \u2264 0.6. Structures with lower pfold are considered \"pre-TS\" and\nwith higher pfold \"post-TS\". The properties of these ensembles are summarized in Table\n1.\n\nIn the TSE we observe a correlation of R = 0.82 between our computed and\n\nexperimental \u03c6-values.\n\n\f18 of 31\nHow does the potential influence pfold? The fact that the Go potential is constructed\nfrom knowledge of a protein's native state and that each atom is unique may lead to the\nunphysical situations where, for example, one (native) phenylalanine \u2013 phenylalanine\ninteraction is attractive, while another (non-native) is not. So while Go serves as an\nextremely useful model that abstracts any of the fundamental theories relating to protein\nfolding40, alone it cannot meaningfully address non-native interactions.\nIf upon passing the transition barrier, descent into the native basin of attraction is\nrapid and energetically downhill, then one may ask the question: how does the Go model,\nwith its idealized, smooth funnel-like representation of the energetic landscape, effect the\nmodeling of this process?\n\nIn order to explore the manner in which attractive and\n\nrepulsive non-native interactions might affect our pfold calculations, we hybridize the Go\n(which ensures folding to the native state) with the \u03bc potential (first described in the\nfolding of the streptococcal protein A50), which treats all interactions as physically\nattractive or repulsive.\n\nA similarly structured hybrid potential (with 90% Go) was\n\nrecently used to study the role of non-native interactions in RNA folding51.\nThe \u03bc potential is calculated according to:\n\nE AB =\n\n\"\u03bcN AB + (1\" \u03bc) N \u0303 AB\n\n(3)\n\n\u03bcN AB + (1\" \u03bc) N \u0303 AB\nwhere EAB is contact interaction energy between atom types A and B, NAB is the number\n! contact and \u00d1 is the number of AB pairs in the database that are not\nof AB pairs found in\nAB\n\nin contact. For this work, \u03bc was chosen (0.9979) such that NAB ranges from \u20131 to +1 and\nhas an average value of 0. Contact statistics were collected from a database of 103 nonhomologous proteins with less than 25% sequence homology, longer than 50, and shorter\n\n\f19 of 31\nthan 200 residues52. Atom types (Supplemental Table 1) were chosen such that each\nunique atom (excluding hydrogen) of each residue sidechain is a unique type. Backbone\natoms are typed without regard to residue identity.\nHere, we repeat the pfold calculations for the 100 conformations created by the\nrestrained unfolding simulations of src-SH3 domain with a hybrid of EAB (Equation 3)\nand 75% EGo. Additionally, we set up the Go potential such that native interactions have\na -1 attraction and non-native interaction have no interaction (as opposed to the +1\nrepulsion of the strict Go potential). Thus, we remove the funnel-like bias towards the\nnative state and introduce meaningful attractive and repulsive non-native interactions. In\norder to maintain uniformity in the interpretation of the results, the same criteria we used\nto define a folded structure. Despite the significantly different (more frustrated) energy\nlandscape, the potential finds the native basin quickly in high pfold conformations, and\nunfolds in low pfold conformations. In fact the correlation for 100 pfold values for the two\nsets is R = 0.85, which strongly suggests that pfold is not sensitive to the details of the\npotential.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Dr. Brian N.
