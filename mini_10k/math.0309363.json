The Toeplitz\nalgebra of G, denoted as T (G), is the universal C\u2217 -algebra generated\nby a set of partial isometries {Se }e\u2208E(G) and projections {Px }x\u2208V(G)\nsatisfying the relations\n\uf8f1\n(1) Px Py = 0\nfor all x, y \u2208 V(G), x 6= y\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u2217\n(2) Se Sf = 0\nfor all e, f \u2208 E(G), e 6= f\n(\u2020)\n\u2217\n(3)\nS\nS\n=\nP\nfor\nall e \u2208 E(G)\n\uf8f4\ne\ns(e)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 (4) Pe\n\u2217\nr(e)=x Se Se \u2264 Px for all x \u2208 V(G).\nThe existence of such a universal object is implicit in [21, Theorem\n3.4] and [18, Theorem 2.12] and was made explicit in [9, Proposition\n1.3 and Theorem 4.1].\n\nDefinition 1.1. Given a countable directed graph G, the tensor algebra\nof G, denoted as T+ (G), is the norm closed subalgebra of T (G) generated by the partial isometries {Se }e\u2208E(G) and projections {Px }x\u2208V(G) .\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 47L80, 47L55, 47L40.\nKey words and phrases. directed graph, partial isometry, Fock space, isomorphism, tensor algebra, free semigroupoid algebra, Toeplitz C\u2217 -algebra.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nE. KATSOULIS AND D.W. KRIBS\n\nThe tensor algebras associated with graphs were introduced under\nthe name quiver algebras by Muhly and Solel in [18] and were further\nstudied in [19]. They were defined rather differently, in the setting\nof C\u2217 -correspondences, but by [8, Corollary 2.2] our Definition 1.1 is\nequivalent to the original one.\nThe primary objective in this paper is to relate the structure of a\ntensor algebra to its graph and show that the graph forms an invariant for bicontinuous isomorphisms between tensor algebras of graphs\n(Theorem 2.11). For tensor algebras associated with graphs having no\nsinks or no sources, we show the graph forms an invariant for algebraic\nisomorphisms as well (Corollary 2.15). For this purpose we prove an\nautomatic continuity theorem, Theorem 2.14, of independent interest.\nIt is easy to see that if two graphs G, G\u2032 are isomorphic, then the\ntensor algebras T+ (G) and T+ (G\u2032 ) are isomorphic by the restriction of\na C\u2217 -isomorphism between the associated Toeplitz algebras. Therefore\nthe focus will be on proving that if T+ (G) is isomorphic to T+ (G\u2032 ) as\na Banach algebra, then G and G\u2032 are isomorphic. The proof of Theorem 2.11 rests on analyzing certain representations for a tensor algebra\nT+ (G). The one dimensional representations (characters) of T+ (G) are\nparametrized by V(G) and points in the unit ball of a complex n-space\nfor various n (Proposition 2.1). The two dimensional nest representations of T+ (G) allow us to identify the edges in a way that reveals\nhow they are \"connected\" and so reveals the graph as an artifact of the\nrepresentation theory of T+ (G) (Theorem 2.6). Independently, similar\nideas were used by Solel [26] to prove an analogue of Theorem 2.11 for\nisometric algebra isomorphisms. (The two papers overlap on the identification of the character spaces, Proposition 2.1 and Theorem 3.5, and\nthe use of nest representations. Note however that the representations\nin [26] are assumed to be contractive while we are forced to make no\nassumptions on ours, apart from continuity.) Our weaker hypothesis\nleads to complications when \"counting\" edges between distinct vertices\nthat need to be addressed (Theorem 2.10).\nLet \u03bbG,0 be the multiplication representation of c0 (V(G)) on l2 (V(G)),\ndetermined by the counting measure on V(G), and let \u03bbG denote the\nrepresentation of T (G) induced by \u03bbG,0 , in the sense of [19] and [8].\nIt is easily seen that the Hilbert space HG of \u03bbG is l2 (F+(G)), where\nF+(G) denotes the free semigroupoid of the graph G (also called the\npath space of G). This consists of all vertices v \u2208 V(G) and all paths\nw = ek ek\u22121 . . . e1 , where the ei are edges satisfying s(ei ) = r(ei\u22121 ),\ni = 2, 3, . . . , k, k \u2208 N. (Paths of the form w = ek ek\u22121 . . . e1 are said\nto have length k, denoted as |w| = k, and vertices are called paths of\nlength 0.) The maps r and s extend to F+(G) in the obvious way, two\n\n\fISOMORPHISMS OF ALGEBRAS FROM DIRECTED GRAPHS\n\n3\n\npaths w1 and w2 are composable precisely when s(w2 ) = r(w1 ) and, in\nthat case, the composition w2 w1 is just the concatenation of w1 and\nw2 . Let {\u03bew }w\u2208F+(G) denote the usual orthonormal basis of l2 (F+(G)),\nwhere \u03bew is the characteristic function of {w}. Then, \u03bbG (Se ), e \u2208 E(G),\nequals the left creation operator Le \u2208 B(l2 (F+(G))) defined by\nLe \u03bew =\n\n\u001a\n\n\u03beew if s(e) = r(w)\n0\notherwise.\n\n(We shall write Pv for \u03bbG (Pv ).) By [8, Corollary 2.2], the representation \u03bbG is a faithful representation of T+ (G), being the restriction\nof a faithful representation of the corresponding Toeplitz algebra. For\nthe rest of the paper, we will identify T+ (G) with its image under \u03bbG ,\ni.e., we consider T+ (G) to be the norm closed algebra generated by the\noperators Le and Pv defined above.\nDefinition 1.2. The weak closure of \u03bbG (T+ (G)) \u2286 B(l2 (F+(G))) is\ncalled the free semigroupoid algebra of G and is denoted as LG .\nThe second author and Power began a systematic study for the free\nsemigroupoid algebras in [14, 15]. These algebras include as special\ncases the space H \u221e realized as the analytic Toeplitz algebra [7, 10]\nand the non commutative analytic Toeplitz algebras Ln , introduced by\nPopescu [22, 23, 24] and studied by Davidson and Pitts [3, 4, 5],\nas well as Arias [1] and the authors [2, 16]. However, this is a broad\nenough class to include various nest algebras, inflation algebras and\ninfinite matrix function algebras as special cases.\nThe second main result of the paper, Theorem 3.9, asserts that given\ncountable directed graphs G and G\u2032 , the free semigroupoid algebras LG\nand LG\u2032 are isomorphic as dual algebras if and only if G are G\u2032 are isomorphic as graphs. This improves one of the main results of [14], which\nshowed that the graph forms an invariant for unitary isomorphism between free semigroupoid algebras, and provided the initial motivation\nfor this paper. Indepedently, Solel [26] proved a similar result for isometric w\u2217-bicontinuous isomorphisms. (Our result can be thought as\nan extension of Solel's result to Hardy algebras [20] associated with\nfinite graphs.) In particular, we show that spatially isomorphic free\nsemigroupoid algebras are unitarily isomorphic. Our methods show,\nin fact, that with a slight additional hypothesis, the graph forms an\ninvariant for algebraic isomorphisms. While the arguments in Section 3\nfollow the general line used in Section 2, the proofs are more involved.\n\n\f4\n\nE. KATSOULIS AND D.W. KRIBS\n\n2. The classification of tensor algebras of graphs\nGiven a countable directed graph G, the character space of T+ (G)\nis denoted as MG . It consists of all non-zero multiplicative linear\nfunctionals on T+ (G) and is equipped with the w \u2217-topology. Given\nx \u2208 V(G), the set of all \u03c1 \u2208 MG so that \u03c1(Px ) = 1 is denoted as\nMG,x . Notice that the finite sums from {Px }x\u2208V(G) form an approximate identity for T+ (G). Therefore, given \u03c1 \u2208 MG there exists at least\none x \u2208 V(G) so that \u03c1(Px ) = 1; the orthogonality of {Px }x\u2208V(G) guarantees that such an x is unique. Given any edge e with distinct source\nand range, the partial isometry Le is nilpotent and so \u03c1(Le ) = 0, for\nany \u03c1 \u2208 MG . Hence, given \u03c1 \u2208 MG,x and a path w, we have \u03c1(Lw ) = 0\nwhenever w passes through a vertex y 6= x.\nProposition 2.1. Let G be a countable directed graph. Let x \u2208 V(G)\nand assume that there exist exactly n distinct loop edges whose source\nis x. Then, MG,x equipped with the w \u2217 -topology is homeomorphic to\nthe closed unit ball Bn inside Cn .\nProof. Let e1 , e2 , . . . , en be the distinct loop edges with source x \u2208\nV(G). We define a map \u03c6x : MG,x \u2212\u2192 Cn by the formula\n\u03c6x (\u03c1) = (\u03c1(Le1 ), \u03c1(Le2 ), . . . , \u03c1(Len )),\n\n\u03c1 \u2208 MG,x .\n\nSince any multiplicative form is completely contractive, and the Lei are\npartial isometries with mutually orthogonal ranges, it follows that the\nrange of \u03c6x is contained in Bn . We will show that \u03c6x is the desired\nhomeomorphism.\nP\nLet \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . \u03bbn ) be an n-tuple satisfying k\u03bbk22 = ni=1 |\u03bbi |2 <\n1; that is, \u03bb belongs to the interior of Bn . We define\nX\nv\u03bb,x = (1 \u2212 k\u03bbk22 )\nw(\u03bb)\u03bew ,\nw\n\nwhere w in the above sum ranges over all monomials in e1 , e2 , . . . , en .\n(This construction originates from [1, 4] and was reiterated in [14]).\nIt is easily seen that v\u03bb,x is an eigenvalue for T+ (G)\u2217 satisfying Px v\u03bb,x =\nv\u03bb,x and L\u2217ei v\u03bb,x = \u03bbi v\u03bb,x . Therefore, the linear form \u03c1\u03bb,x defined as\n\u03c1\u03bb,x (A) = hAv\u03bb,x , v\u03bb,x i,\n\nA \u2208 T+ (G),\n\nbelongs to MG,x .\nThe above paragraph, combined with a compactness argument, shows\nthat \u03c6x (MG,x ) = Bn . Now we show that \u03c6x is injective. If \u03c11 , \u03c12 \u2208 MG,x\nso that \u03c6x (\u03c11 ) = \u03c6x (\u03c12 ), then \u03c11 (Lei ) = \u03c12 (Lei ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n. As we\nhave mentioned earlier, \u03c11 (Lf ) = \u03c12 (Lf ) = 0 for all other f \u2208 E(G) and\nso \u03c11 and \u03c12 agree on the generators of T+ (G). By continuity, \u03c11 = \u03c12 .\n\n\fISOMORPHISMS OF ALGEBRAS FROM DIRECTED GRAPHS\n\n5\n\nWe have established that \u03c6x is an continuous injective map between\ncompact Hausdorff spaces. Hence \u03c6\u22121\n\u0004\nx is also continuous.\nRemark 2.2. If n = \u221e, then a easy modification of the above proof\nshows that MG,x is isomorphic to the closed unit ball of l2 , equipped\nwith the weak topology.\nCorollary 2.3. If G is a countable directed graph, then MG is a locally\ncompact Hausdorff space whose connected components coincide with\nMG,x , x \u2208 V (G).\nProof. The space MG \u222a{0} is a compact Hausdorff space and so MG is\nlocally compact. Fix an x \u2208 V(G) and consider the map \u03c8x : MG \u2212\u2192 C\ndefined as\n\u03c8x (\u03c1) = \u03c1(Px ), \u03c1 \u2208 MG .\nClearly, \u03c8x is continuous and MG,x = \u03c8x\u22121 ({1}) = \u03c8x\u22121 ((0, 2)). Hence,\nMG,x is clopen.

Consider the Hilbert space\nHe \u2286 HG generated by the orthogonal vectors \u03bex1 , \u03bee and let Ee be the\northogonal projection on He . Notice that for any edge f \u2208 E(G),\nL\u2217f \u03bex1 = 0. In addition, either L\u2217f \u03bee = \u03bex1 or L\u2217f \u03bee = 0, for all f \u2208 E(G).\nIn any case, the space He is co-invariant by T+ (G) and so the mapping\n\u03c0e (A) = Ee AEe , A \u2208 T+ (G), defines a representation for T+ (G) on He .\nLet N be the subspace generated by \u03bee and let N = {0, N, I}. The\nprevious considerations show that N is invariant by Ee T+ (G)Ee and so\n\u03c0e maps into Alg N .

First\nwe show that the collection,\nLei + Kx,y ,\n\ni = 1, 2, . . . , n,\n\nis a generating set for rad(T+ (G)/Kx,y ).\nIndeed, let A+Kx,y = Py APx +Kx,y \u2208 rad(T+ (G)/Kx,y ) by Lemma 2.8,\nand let\nX\np(L) =\nawk Lwk + Kx,y\nwk =ywk x\n\nbe a polynomial which is \u01eb-close to A + Kx,y . We may assume that each\nLwk in the sum above factors as Lwk = Luk Lei Lvk , for some uk , vk \u2208\nF+(G) and i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}. (An Lwk not of this form is easily seen to\nbelong to Kx,y since \u03c0(Pz ) = 0 for \u03c0 \u2208 repx,y (T+ (G)) and z \u2208\n/ {x, y}.)\nHence each Lwk + Kx,y belongs to the ideal generated by Lei + Kx,y ,\ni = 1, 2, . . . , n, and so does p(L)+Kx,y . But the polynomials p(L)+Kx,y\napproximate A + Kx,y and so Lei + Kx,y , i = 1, 2, . . . , n, is a generating\nset for rad(T+ (G)/Kx,y ).\nBy way of contradiction assume that there exists a generating set\nAj + Kx,y ,\n\nj = 1, 2, . . . , m,\n\nfor rad(T+ (G)/Kx,y ) with m < n.

Given a directed graph G, we associate a graph\nG, which is constructed using the algebraic structure of T+ (G) as follows. The vertices of G are the connected components of the character\nspace MG of T+ (G). By Corollary 2.3 there is a natural one-to-one correspondence g : V(G) \u2212\u2192 V(G) so that \u03c1(Pg(x) ) = 1, for all \u03c1 \u2208 x. To\neach vertex x \u2208 V(G), we attach as many loop edges as the homeomorphic class of x. By Proposition 2.1, the number of loop edges starting\nat x and g(x) are equal. Given two distinct vertices x1 , x2 \u2208 V(G), we\ncreate as many directed edges from x1 to x2 as the least number of generators for rad(T+ (G)/Kg(x1 ),g(x2 ) ) \u2286 T+ (G)/Kg(x1 ),g(x2 ) , provided that\nrepg(x1 ),g(x2 ) (G) 6= \u2205. Theorem 2.10 shows that the number of directed\nedges from x1 to x2 and g(x1 ) to g(x2 ) coincide. Hence, G and G are\nisomorphic as graphs.\nTheorem 2.11. Let G, G\u2032 be countable directed graphs. The algebras\nT+ (G), T+ (G\u2032 ) are isomorphic as Banach algebras if and only if the\ngraphs G are G\u2032 are isomorphic.\n\n\f10\n\nE. KATSOULIS AND D.W. KRIBS\n\nProof. Assume that the algebras T+ (G), T+ (G\u2032 ) are isomorphic as\nBanach algebras. It suffices to show that the graphs G and G\u2032 are\nisomorphic. Let\n\u03c4 : T+ (G) \u2212\u2192 T+ (G\u2032 )\nbe a bicontinuous isomorphism between T+ (G) and T+ (G\u2032 ). Then,\n\u03c4 induces a homeomorphism between the character spaces of T+ (G)\nand T+ (G\u2032 ), which we still denote as \u03c4 , and is defined by the formula\n\u03c4 (\u03c1) = \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03c4 \u22121 , \u03c1 \u2208 MG . Since homeomorphisms preserve connected\ncomponents, \u03c4 establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the\nvertices of G and G\u2032 , which we, once again, denote as \u03c4 . It is clear\nthat the number of loop edges attached between x and \u03c4 (x), x \u2208 V(G),\ncoincide.\nLet x1 , x2 be two distinct connected components of MG .\nClaim: \u03c0 \u2208 repx1 ,x2 (G) if and only if \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c4 \u22121 \u2208 rep\u03c4 (x1 ),\u03c4 (x2 ) (G\u2032 ).\nAssume that \u03c0 \u2208 repx1 ,x2 (G). Let N be a nest such that \u03c0 maps\nT+ (G) onto Alg N and let h1 , h2 be as in (1) so that\n\u03c1(i)\n\u03c0 (A) = h\u03c0(A)hi , hi i,\n\nA \u2208 T+ (G).\n\n(i)\n\nAssume that, \u03c1\u03c0 \u2208 xi , i = 1, 2. Now \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c4 \u22121 is a representation of\nT+ (G\u2032 ) and by definition,\n(i)\n\n\u03c1\u03c0\u25e6\u03c4 \u22121 (A\u2032 ) = h\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c4 \u22121 (A\u2032 )hi , hi i,\n(i)\n\nA\u2032 \u2208 T+ (G\u2032 ).\n\n(i)\n\nTherefore, \u03c1\u03c0\u25e6\u03c4 \u22121 (\u03c4 (A)) = \u03c1\u03c0 (A) for A \u2208 T+ (G) and so\n(i)\n\n\u03c1\u03c0\u25e6\u03c4 \u22121 = \u03c1\u03c0(i) \u25e6 \u03c4 \u22121 = \u03c4 (\u03c1(i)\n\u03c0 ) \u2208 \u03c4 (xi )\nThis proves one direction of the claim. By reversing the above argument, we obtain the other direction.\nThe claim above implies now that \u03c4 (Kx1 ,x2 ) = K\u03c4 (x1 ),\u03c4 (x2 ) and so \u03c4\ninduces an isomorphism between T+ (G)/Kx,y and T+ (G\u2032 )/K\u03c4 (x1 ),\u03c4 (x2 ) .\nFurthermore,\n\u03c4 (rad(T+ (G)/Kx1 ,x2 )) = rad(T+ (G\u2032 )/K\u03c4 (x1 ),\u03c4 (x2 ) )\nand so rad(T+ (G)/Kx1,x2 ) is n-generated whenever rad(T+ (G\u2032 )/K\u03c4 (x1 ),\u03c4 (x2 ) )\nis. Hence \u03c4 preserves the number of directed edges between distinct\nvertices of the graphs G and G\u2032 . This concludes the proof.\n\u0004\nGiven an (algebraic) isomorphism or an epimorphism between two\nBanach algebras, it is always desirable to know whether or not it is\ncontinuous. This is the problem of automatic continuity and it has\nattracted much attention since the early stages of Banach algebra theory. An important tool for the study of this problem is Rickart's notion\n\n\fISOMORPHISMS OF ALGEBRAS FROM DIRECTED GRAPHS\n\n11\n\nof a separating space. Let \u03c6 : A \u2212\u2192 B be an epimorphism between\nBanach algebras and let S(\u03c6) be the separating space of \u03c6. This is the\ntwo-sided closed ideal of B defined as\n\b\nS(\u03c6) = b \u2208 B | \u2203{an }n \u2286 A such that an \u2192 0 and \u03c6(an ) \u2192 b .\n\nOne can easily see that the graph of \u03c6 is closed if and only if S(\u03c6) =\n{0}. Thus by the closed graph theorem, \u03c6 is continuous if and only if\nS(\u03c6) = {0}.\nThe following is an adaption of [25, Lemma 2.1] and was used in [6]\nfor the study of isomorphisms between limit algebras.\nLemma 2.12 (Sinclair). Let \u03c6 : A \u2212\u2192 B be an epimorphism between\nBanach algebras and let {Bn }n\u2208N be any sequence in B. Then there\nexists n0 \u2208 N so that for all n \u2265 n0 ,\nB1 B2 . . .

B1 .\nThe above lemma will allow us to classify a large class of tensor\nalgebras up to algebraic isomorphism.\nDefinition 2.13. A vertex x of a countable directed graph is said to\nbe a sink (resp. source) if it emits (resp. receives) no edges.\nTheorem 2.14. Let G be a countable directed graph which has either\nno sinks or no sources. If A is any Banach algebra and \u03c6 : A \u2212\u2192\nT+ (G) is an epimorphism of algebras then \u03c6 is automatically continuous.\nProof. Consider the extension \u03c6\u0302 : A + CI \u2212\u2192 T+ (G) + CI of \u03c6. It\nsuffices to show that \u03c6\u0302 is continuous.\nAssume that G has no sinks. By way of contradiction assume that\n\u03c6\u0302 is not continuous and so S(\u03c6\u0302) 6= {0}. If there are infinitely many\ndistinct xn \u2208 V(G), n \u2208 N, so that Pxn S(\u03c6\u0302) 6= 0, then the sequence\nBn = I \u2212\n\nn\nX\n\nPx i\n\ni=1\n\ncontradicts Lemma 2.12. Hence there exists a vertex x \u2208 V(G) and\na path w = ywx, y \u2208 V(G), so that Px S(\u03c6\u0302) 6= 0 and the vertex y\nsupports at least one loop, say u \u2208 F+(G). (Indeed, otherwise we\ncould start from x, move forward on an infinite path with no loops, by\nmultiplying on the left with the corresponding creation operators, and\n\n\f12\n\nE. KATSOULIS AND D.W. KRIBS\n\ntherefore produce infinitely many distinct Px with Px S(\u03c6) 6= 0.) Hence\nPy S(\u03c6\u0302) 6= 0 and we have\n(Lu )n S(\u03c6\u0302) = (Lu )n S(\u03c6\u0302) \u2283 (Lu )n+1 S(\u03c6\u0302) = (Lu )n+1 S(\u03c6\u0302).\nThis shows that the sequence Bn = (Lu )n , n \u2265 1, contradicts Lemma 2.12\nand so \u03c6 is necessarily continuous.\nAn argument similar to the one above shows that \u03c6\u0302 is also continuous\nwhen G has no sources.\n\u0004\nCorollary 2.15. Let G, G\u2032 be countable directed graphs which which\nhave no sinks or no sources. Then T+ (G) and T+ (G\u2032 ) are algebraically\nisomorphic if and only if the graphs G and G\u2032 are isomorphic.\nIn order to show that the graph of any tensor algebra is an invariant\nfor algebraic isomorphisms, one has to extend Theorem 2.14 to arbitrary countable graphs. At the present, we do not know how to do\nthis. Nevertheless, there are cases where the automatic continouity of\nthe algebraic isomorphism is not needed, as the following result shows.\nCorollary 2.16. Let G, G\u2032 be countable directed graphs with no loop\nedges. Then T+ (G) and T+ (G\u2032 ) are algebraically isomorphic if and only\nif the graphs G and G\u2032 are isomorphic.\nProof. In this case we assume that repx,y (G) consists of not necessarily\ncontinuous representations and we proceed as earlier. The difference\nhere is that rad(AG /Kx,y ) is an n-dimensional vector space, provided\nthat there exist exactly n-directed edges from x to y. This property is\npreserved by arbitrary isomorphisms and the conclusion follows.\n\u0004\n3. An Application to Free Semigroupoid Algebra Theory\nThe free semigroupoid algebras have been classified by Kribs and\nPower [14] up to unitary equivalence. Once again, the graph forms a\ncomplete invariant. In light of Theorem 2.11, it is natural to ask if the\ngraph forms a complete invariant for bicontinuous or even algebraic\nisomorphisms. In Theorem 3.9 we show that two free semigroupoid\nalgebras are isomorphic as dual algebras if and only if the associated\ngraphs are isomorphic. In particular, our result classifies the free semigroupoid algebras up to similarity and shows that two such algebras\nare similar if and only if they are unitarily equivalent. For free semigroupoid algebras associated with locally finite directed graphs with\nno sinks, we show that the graph forms an invariant for algebraic isomorphisms as well.\n\n\fISOMORPHISMS OF ALGEBRAS FROM DIRECTED GRAPHS\n\n13\n\nThe proof of Theorem 3.9 follows the same line of reasoning as that\nof Theorem 2.11.

Clearly, the (disjoint) union of\n\u2217\nw\u2217\nall Mw\nG,x , x \u2208 V(G), equals MG .\nDefinition 3.1. Let G be a countable directed graph and let x \u2208 V(G).\nWe say that a directed loop u = xux is primitive if it does not factor\nas u = wv, where w, v \u2208 F+(G), r(w) = s(w) = r(v) = s(v) = x, and\n1 \u2264 |w| < |u|. Clearly any loop edge supported at x is a primitive loop\nbut there may be many more. The collection of all primitive loops w\nwith r(x) = s(x) = x is denoted as P(F+(G), x).\nLemma 3.2. Let G be a countable directed graph, x \u2208 V(G) and let\nu1 , u2, . . . , un , with n = \u221e possibly, be the primitive loops with source\nx. Then there exists a w \u2217 -bicontinuous isomorphism from Px LG Px onto\nLn , which maps Lui to Li for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.\nProof. It suffices to show that Px LG Px is unitarily equivalent to an ampliation of Ln , such that generators are mapped to generators. Clearly\nPx LG Px is generated by Lw with w \u2208 P(F+(G), x). Let Tx be the collection of all vectors \u03bew , w = xw, such that w 6= uv, u \u2208 P(F+(G), x),\nv \u2208 F+(G). The subspaces\n\b\nVw = span A\u03bew : A \u2208 Px LG Px\nfor w \u2208 Tx \u222a {\u03bex }\nare mutually orthogonal, reducing for Px LG Px , and satisfy\nX\n\u2295 Vw = Px (HG ).\nw\u2208Tx \u222a{\u03bex }\n\nFor each w \u2208 Tx \u222a {\u03bex } consider the unitary operator\nUw : Vw \u2212\u2192 Hn\ndefined by Uw (\u03bew ) = \u03be\u2205 and\n\u0001\nUw \u03beui1 ui2 ...uim w = \u03bei1 i2 ...im ,\n\nfor any ui1 , ui2 , . . . , uim \u2208 P(F+(G), x). Then it is evident that a desired\nunitary operator is given by \u2295w\u2208Tx \u222a{\u03bex } Uw .\n\u0004\nIf w is a loop with source x \u2208 V(G), then kwk denotes the number\nof primitive loops whose product equals w.\n\n\f14\n\nE.

The proof follows from the identification of Px LG Px with Ln\n(Lemma 3.2) and an application of [3, Lemma 3.1].\n\u0004\nWe also need the following lemma, whose proof is similar to that of\nLemma 3.2. (Compare also with [26, Proposition 3.1]).\nLemma 3.4. Let G be a countable directed graph, x \u2208 V(G) and\nlet e1 , e2 , . . . , en \u2208 E(G) so that r(ei ) = s(ei ) = x, i = 1, 2, . . . , n.\nLet alg(Px , Le1 , Le2 , . . . , Len ) be the w \u2217 -closed algebra generated by Px\nand Le1 , Le2 , . . . , Len . Then there exists a w \u2217 -bicontinuous isomorphism from alg(Px , Le1 , Le2 , . . . , Len ) onto Ln , which maps Lei to Li ,\ni = 1, 2, . . . , n.\nTheorem 3.5. Let G be a countable directed graph. Let x \u2208 V(G)\nand assume there exists exactly n distinct loop edges whose source is x.\n\u2217\n\u2217\nThen Mw\nG,x equipped with the relative w -topology is homeomorphic to\n\u25e6\nn\nBn , the open unit ball of C .\nProof. Let e1 , e2 , . . . , en , ei = xei x, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, be the distinct loop\n\u2217\nn\nedges starting at x \u2208 V(G) and define \u03c6x : Mw\nG,x \u2212\u2192 C by the formula\n\u03c6x (\u03c1) = (\u03c1(Le1 ), \u03c1(Le2 ), . . . , \u03c1(Len )),\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03c1 \u2208 Mw\nG,x .\n\nSince any multiplicative form is completely contractive, the range of \u03c6x\nis contained in Bn . We will show that \u03c6x is the desired homeomorphism.\nArguing as in the proof of Proposition 2.1, we obtaint that \u03c6x (MG,x ) \u2286\n\u25e6\nBn . Now Lemma 3.4 shows that if there were w \u2217 -continuous multiplica\u2217\ntive forms \u03c1 \u2208 Mw\nG,x with \u03c1 \u2208 \u03b8Bn , then such forms would also exist\non Ln . But this contradicts [3, Theorem 2.3] and so \u03c6x (MG,x ) = B\u25e6n .\nWe now show that \u03c6\u22121\nxP is continuous. Let A = Px APx\u2217 \u2208 LG with\nFourier expansion A \u223c w=xwx aw Lw and let \u03c1, \u03bc \u2208 Mw\nG,x satisfying\nk\u03c6x (\u03c1)k2 , k\u03c6x (\u03bc)k2 \u2264 r < 1.

If G is a countable directed graph, then Mw\nG is a locally\ncompact Hausdorff space whose connected components coincide with\n\u2217\nMw\nG,x , x \u2208 V (G).\nWe now proceed as in Section 2. Given two distinct vertices x1 , x2\n\u2217\nin a directed graph G, we define repw\nx1 ,x2 (LG ) to be the collection of\nall w \u2217-continuous, two dimensional nest representations \u03c0 for which\n(i)\n\u03c1\u03c0 \u2208 Mx\u2217\nG,xi , i = 1, 2. Arguing as in Corollary 2.6, one shows that\nw\u2217\nrepx1 ,x2 (LG ) 6= \u2205 exactly when there exists e \u2208 E(G) such that e =\nx2 ex1 .

It is a\nstandard result in Functional Analysis that the dual Banach space of\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u22a5\n(Kxw1 ,x2 ) is isometrically isomorphic to LG /Kxw1 ,x2 . Therefore LG /Kxw1 ,x2\ncan be equiped with a w \u2217 -topology so that it becomes a dual Banach\nalgebra.\n\nDefinition 3.7. Let I be a w \u2217 -closed ideal of a dual Banach algebra\nB and let {Bi }i\u2208I be a subset of I. The set {Bi }i\u2208I is said to be a w*generating set for I if the w \u2217 -closed ideal generated by {Bi }i\u2208I equals\nI. (In that case, the Bi 's are said to be the w*-generators of I.) The\nideal I is said to be n-generated with respect to the w \u2217 -topology iff n\nis the smallest cardinality of a w \u2217 -generating set. If in addition, the\nsequential w \u2217 -closure, i.e., w \u2217 -limits of sequences, of the algebraic ideal\ngenerated by the n generators equals I, then I is said to be sequentially\nn-generated.\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nw\nw\nAs in Section 2, let rad(LG /Kx,y\n) be the Jacobson radical of LG /Kx,y\n.\nw\u2217\nAn argument similar to that of Proposition 2.7 shows that rad(LG /Kx,y )\nw\u2217\nw\u2217\nconsists of all cosets A + Kx,y\n\u2208 LG /Kx,y\nwhich satisfy \u03c0(A)2 = 0, for\n\u2217\nall \u03c0 \u2208 repw\nx,y (LG ).\n\n\f16\n\nE.

Let G, G\u2032 be countable directed graphs. Then there\nexists a w \u2217 -bicontinuous isomorphism \u03c4 : LG \u2212\u2192 LG\u2032 if and only if the\ngraphs G and G\u2032 are isomorphic.\nDefinition 3.10. If A (resp.

If S\nis a unitary operator then A and B are said to be unitarily isomorphic.\nCorollary 3.11. Two free semigroupoid algebras LG and LG\u2032 are spatially isomorphic if and only if they are unitarily isomorphic.\nProof. A similarity between two free semigroupoid algebras LG and\nLG\u2032 is a map satisfying the requirements of Theorem 3.9. Therefore,\nthe graphs G and G\u2032 are isomorphic and so LG and LG\u2032 are unitarily\nisomorphic [14, Theorem 9.1]. The other direction is trivial.\n\u0004\nRemark 3.12. It should be emphasized that a spatial isomorphism\nbetween two free semigroupoid algebras LG and LG\u2032 need not transform \u03bbG into \u03bbG\u2032 . The relation between the spatial isomorphism and\nthe unitary isomorphism guaranteed by our analysis can be quite mysterious. This is partly due to the fact that our understanding of the\nstructure of the automorphism group of a free semigroup algebra is still\nlimited.\nIn order to prove that the graph forms an invariant for algebraic\nisomorphisms of free semigroupoid algebras, it remains to show that\nalgebraic isomorphisms between such algebras are w \u2217 -continuous. In\nwhat follows we do this for a special class of graphs. The general case\nremains open.\nTheorem 3.13. Let G be a countable directed graph with no sinks and\nlet A be any Banach algebra. If \u03c4 : A \u2212\u2192 LG is an epimorphism of\nalgebras then \u03c4 is automatically continuous.\nProof. The proof is identical to that of Theorem 2.14.\n\n\u0004\n\n\f18\n\nE. KATSOULIS AND D.W. KRIBS\n\nOne of the main results in [13] asserts that the algebra LG satisfies\nthe property A1 , provided that G has no sinks. Therefore for the free\nsemigroupoid algebras considered in the rest of this section, the WOT\nand w \u2217 -topology coincide.\nLemma 3.14. Let G, G\u2032 be locally finite directed graphs with no sinks.\nIf \u03c4 : LG \u2212\u2192 LG\u2032 is an algebraic isomorphism, then \u03c4 (L0,k\nG ), for k \u2265 1,\n\u2217\nis w -closed.\nProof.

It suffices to show that x\u2208V(G) \u03c4\u0302 (Px ) = I, in\nthe strong topology.\nNote that since the projections Px , x \u2208 V(G), are mutually orthogonal, the same is true for \u03c4\u0302 (Px ), x \u2208 V(G).

Suppose A\u03b1 \u223c\ndecompose Px A\u03b1 = B\u03b1,x + C\u03b1,x where\nX\nB\u03b1,x =\na(\u03b1)\nxw Lxw\n\nP\n\nw\n\n(\u03b1)\n\naw Lw and\n\n|w|<k\n\nand\n\nC\u03b1,x = A\u03b1,x \u2212 B\u03b1,x =\n\nX\n\n0,k\nLw A(\u03b1)\nw \u2208 LG\u2032 .\n\n|w|=k\n\nBy construction, h\u03c4 (C\u03b1 )\u03be\u03c6 , \u03b6i = 0 since \u03c4 (C\u03b1 )\u03be\u03c6 belongs to Jk HG\u2032 .\n(\u03b1)\n(\u03b1)\nOn the other hand, aw = hA\u03b1 \u03bes(w), \u03bew i, so that lim\u03b1 aw = 0 for all\nP\n(\u03b1)\nw \u2208 F+(G), |w| < k. Since the sum B\u03b1,x = |w|<k axw Lxw is finite (G\nis locally finite), the desired inequality (5) follows.\n\u0004\nCorollary 3.17. Let G, G\u2032 be locally finite directed graphs with no\nsinks. Then LG and LG\u2032 are isomorphic as algebras if and only if the\ngraphs G and G\u2032 are isomorphic.\nAcknowledgements.
