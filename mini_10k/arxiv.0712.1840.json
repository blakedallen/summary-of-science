Introduction\nThis paper is an enlarged version of the three lectures we gave in July 2007 during\nthe summer school Higher dimensional geometry over finite fields, June 25 - July\n06, 2007, Mathematisches Institut, Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen.\nThe goal of the paper is to provide to non-specialists an efficient, accessible,\nand in depth introduction to the theory of integral models of Shimura varieties\nof Hodge type. Accordingly, the paper will put a strong accent on defining the\nmain objects of interest, on listing the main problems, on presenting the main\ntechniques used in approaching the main problems, and on stating very explicitly\nthe main results obtained so far. This is not an easy task, as only to be able to list\nthe main problems one requires a good comprehension of the language of schemes,\nof reductive groups, of abelian varieties, of Hodge cycles on abelian varieties, of\ncohomology theories (including \u00e9tale and crystalline ones), of deformation theories,\nof p-divisible groups, and of F -crystals. Whenever possible, proofs are included.\nWe begin with a motivation for the study of Shimura varieties of Hodge\ntype. Let X be a connected, smooth, projective variety over C. We recall that\nthe albanese variety of X is an abelian variety Alb(X) over C equipped with\na morphism aX : X \u2192 Alb(X) that has the following universal property. If\nbX : X \u2192 B is another morphism from X to an abelian variety B over C,\nthen there exists a unique morphism c : Alb(X) \u2192 B such that the following\nidentity bX = c \u25e6 aX holds. This universal property determines Alb(X) uniquely\nup to isomorphisms. Not only Alb(X) is uniquely determined by X, but also the\n1\n\n\fimage Im(aX ) is uniquely determined by X up to isomorphisms. Thus to X one\nassociates an abelian variety Alb(X) over C as well as a closed subvariety Im(aX )\nof it. If X belongs to a good class C of connected, smooth, projective varieties\nover C, then deformations of X would naturally give birth to deformations of\nthe closed embedding Im(aX ) \u0592\u2192 Alb(X). Thus the study of moduli spaces of\nobjects of the class C is very much related to the study of moduli spaces of\nabelian schemes endowed with certain closed subschemes (which naturally give\nbirth to some polarizations). For instance, if X is a curve of positive genus, then\nAlb(X) = Jac(X) and the morphism aX is a closed embedding; to this embedding\none associates naturally a principal polarization of Jac(X). This implies that\ndifferent moduli spaces of geometrically connected, smooth, projective curves are\nsubspaces of different moduli spaces of principally polarized abelian schemes.\nFor the sake of generality and flexibility, it does not suffice to study moduli\nspaces of abelian schemes endowed with polarizations and with certain closed subschemes. More precisely, one is naturally led to study moduli spaces of polarized\nabelian schemes endowed with families of Hodge cycles. They are called Shimura\nvarieties of Hodge type (see Subsection 3.4). The classical Hodge conjecture predicts that each Hodge cycle is an algebraic cycle. Thus we refer to Subsection\n2.5 for a quick introduction to Hodge cycles on abelian schemes over reduced\nQ\u2013schemes. Subsections 2.1 to 2.5 review basic properties of algebraic groups, of\nHodge structures, and of families of tensors.\nShimura varieties can be defined abstractly via few axioms due to Deligne (see\nSubsection 3). They are in natural bijection to Shimura pairs (G, X ). Here G is a\nreductive group over Q and X is a hermitian symmetric domain whose points form\na G(R)-conjugacy class of homomorphisms (C \\ {0}, *) \u2192 GR of real groups, that\nare subject to few axioms. Initially one gets a complex Shimura variety Sh(G, X )C\ndefined over C (see Subsection 3.1). The totally discontinuous, locally compact\ngroup G(Af ) acts naturally on Sh(G, X )C from the right. Cumulative works of\nShimura, Taniyama, Deligne, Borovoi, Milne, etc., have proved that Sh(G, X )C\nhas a canonical model Sh(G, X ) over a number field E(G, X ) which is intrinsically\nassociated to the Shimura pair (G, X ) and which is called the reflex field of (G, X )\n(see Subsection 3.2). One calls Sh(G, X ) together with the natural right action\nof G(Af ) on it, as the Shimura variety defined by the Shimura pair (G, X ). For\ninstance, if G = GL 2 and X \u2192C\n \u0303 \\ R is isomorphic to two copies of the upper halfplane, then Sh(G, X ) is the elliptic modular variety over Q and is the projective\nlimit indexed by N \u2208 N of the affine modular curves Y (N ).\nLet H be a compact, open subgroup of G(Af ). The quotient scheme\nSh(G, X )/H exists and is a normal, quasi-projective scheme over E(G, X ). If v\nis a prime of E(G, X ) of residue field k(v) and if N is a good integral model\nof Sh(G, X )/H over the local ring O(v) of v, then one gets a Shimura variety\nNk(v) over the finite field k(v). The classical example of a good integral model\nis Mumford moduli scheme Ar,1 . Here r \u2208 N, the Z-scheme Ar,1 is the course\nmoduli scheme of principally polarized abelian scheme of relative dimension r,\nand the Q\u2013scheme Ar,1,Q is of the form Sh(G, X )/H for (G, X ) a Shimura pair\nthat defines (see Example 3.1.2) a Siegel modular variety.\nIn this paper, we are mainly interested in Shimura varieties of Hodge type.\nRoughly speaking, they are those Shimura varieties for which one can naturally\n2\n\n\fchoose N to be a finite scheme over Ar,1,O(v) . In this paper we study N and its\nspecial fibre Nk(v) . See Subsections 4.1 and 4.2 for some moduli interpretations\nof N . See Section 5 for different results pertaining to the uniqueness of N . See\nSection 6 for basic results that pertain to the smooth locus of N . See Section 7 for\nthe list of cases in which N is known to be (or it is expected to be) a projective\nO(v) -scheme. Section 8 presents four main stratifications of the (smooth locus of\nthe) special fibre Nk(v) and their basic properties. These four stratifications are\ndefined by (see Subsections 8.3, 8.4, 8.6, and 8.7 respectively):\n(a) Newton polygons of p-divisible groups;\n(b) isomorphism classes of principally quasi-polarized F -isocrystals with tensors;\n(c) inner isomorphism classes of the reductions modulo integral powers of p\nof principally quasi-polarized F -crystals with tensors;\n(d) isomorphism classes of principally quasi-polarized F -crystals with tensors.\nThe principally quasi-polarized F -crystals with tensors attached naturally to\npoints of the smooth locus of Nk(v) with values in algebraically closed fields are\nintroduced in Subsection 8.1. Generalities on stratifications of reduced schemes\nover fields are presented in Subsection 8.2. Subsection 8.5 shows that the smooth\nlocus of Nk(v) is a quasi Shimura p-variety of Hodge type in the sense of [Va5,\nDef. 4.2.1]. Subsection 8.5 is used in Subsections 8.6 and 8.7 to define the last\ntwo stratifications, called the level m and Traverso stratifications.\n\n2. A group theoretical review\nIn this section we review basic properties of algebraic groups, of Hodge structure,\nof families of tensors, and of Hodge cycles on abelian schemes over reduced Q\u2013\nschemes. We denote by k\u0304 an algebraic closure of a field k.\nWe denote by Ga and Gm the affine, smooth groups over k with the property\nthat for each commutative k-algebra C, the groups Ga (C) and Gm (C) are the\nadditive group of C and the multiplicative group of units of C (respectively). As\nschemes, we have Ga = Spec(k[x]) and Gm = Spec(k[x][ x1 ]). Thus the dimension\nof either Ga or Gm is 1. For t \u2208 N, let \u03bc t be the kernel of the tth -power endomorphism of Gm . An algebraic group scheme over k is called linear, if it is isomorphic\nto a subgroup scheme of GL n for some n \u2208 N.\n2.1. Algebraic groups\nLet G be a smooth group over k which is of finite type. Let G0 be the identity\ncomponent of G. We have a short exact sequence\n(1)\n\n0 \u2192 G0 \u2192 G \u2192 G/G0 \u2192 0,\n3\n\n\fwhere the quotient group G/G0 is finite and \u00e9tale. A classical theorem of Chevalley\nshows that, if k is either perfect or of characteristic 0, then there exists a short\nexact sequence\n(2)\n\n0 \u2192 L \u2192 G0 \u2192 A \u2192 0,\n\nwhere A is an abelian variety over k and where L is a connected, smooth, linear\ngroup over k. In what follows we assume that (2) exists. Let Lu be the unipotent\nradical of L. It is the maximal connected, smooth, normal subgroup of L which\nis unipotent (i.e., which over k\u0304 has a composition series whose factors are Ga\ngroups). We have a short exact sequence\n(3)\n\n0 \u2192 Lu \u2192 L \u2192 R \u2192 0,\n\nwhere R := L/Lu is a reductive group over k (i.e., it is a smooth, connected, linear\ngroup over k whose unipotent radical is trivial). By the k-rank of R we mean the\ngreatest non-negative integer s such that Gsm is a subgroup of R. If the k-rank of\nR is equal to the k\u0304-rank of Rk\u0304 , then we say that R is split.\nLet Z(R) be the (scheme-theoretical) center of R. It is a group scheme of\nmultiplicative type (i.e., over k\u0304 it is the extension of a finite product of \u03bc t group\nschemes by a torus Gnm ; here n \u2208 N \u222a {0} and t \u2208 N). The quotient group\nRad := R/Z(R) is called the adjoint group of R; it is a reductive group over k\nwhose (scheme-theoretical) center is trivial. Let Rder be the derived group of R; it\nis the minimal, normal subgroup of R with the property that the quotient group\nRab := R/Rder is abelian. The group Rab is a torus (i.e., over k\u0304 it is isomorphic to\nGnm ). The groups Rad and Rder are semisimple. We have two short exact sequences\n(4)\n\n0 \u2192 Z(R) \u2192 R \u2192 Rad \u2192 0\n\nand\n(5)\n\n0 \u2192 Rder \u2192 R \u2192 Rab \u2192 0.\n\nThe short exact sequences (1) to (5) are intrinsically associated to G.\nIf G = GL n , then Z(G) and Gab are isomorphic to Gm , Gder = SL n , and\nad\nG = PGLn . If G = GSp2n , then Z(G) and Gab are isomorphic to Gm , Gder =\nSp2n , and Gad = PGSp2n = Sp2n /\u03bc\n\u03bc2 . If G = SO 2n+1 , then Z(G) and Gab are\ntrivial and therefore from (4) and (5) we get that G = Gder = Gad .\n2.1.1. Examples of semisimple groups over Q\nLet a, b \u2208 N\u222a{0} with a+b > 0. Let SU(a, b) be the simply connected semisimple\ngroup over Q whose Q\u2013valued points are the Q(i)\u2013valued points of SLa+b,Q that\nleave invariant the hermitian form \u2212z1 z 1 \u2212 * * * \u2212 za z a + za+1 z a+1 + * * * + za+b z a+b\nover Q(i). Let SO(a, b) be the semisimple group over Q of a + b by a + b matrices\nof determinant 1 that leave invariant the quadratic form \u2212x21 \u2212 * * * \u2212 x2a + x2a+1 +\n* * * + x2a+b on Qa+b . Let SOa := SO(0, a). Let SO\u2217 (2a) be the semisimple group\nover Q whose group of Q\u2013valued points is the subgroup of SO2n (Q(i)) that leaves\ninvariant the skew hermitian form \u2212z1 z n+1 + zn+1 z 1 \u2212 * * * \u2212 zn z 2n + z2n z n over\nQ(i) (zi 's and xi 's are related here over Q(i) via zi = xi ).\n4\n\n\fDef inition 1. By a reductive group scheme R over a scheme Z, we mean a smooth\ngroup scheme over Z which is an affine Z-scheme and whose fibres are reductive\ngroups over fields.\nAs above, one defines group schemes Z(R), Rad , Rder , and Rab over Z which\nare affine Z-schemes. The group scheme Z(R) is of multiplicative type. The group\nschemes Rad and Rder are semisimple. The group scheme Rab is a torus.\n2.2. Weil restrictions\nLet i : l \u0592\u2192 k be a separable finite field extension. Let G be a group scheme over\nk which is of finite type. Let Resk/l be the group scheme over l obtained from G\nthrough the Weil restriction of scalars. Thus Resk/l G is defined by the functorial\ngroup identification\n(6)\n\nHom(Y, Resk/l G) = Hom(Y \u00d7l k, G),\n\nwhere Y is an arbitrary l-scheme. We have\n(7)\n\nY\n\n(Resk/l G)k\u0304 = Resk\u2297l k\u0304/k\u0304 Gk\u2297l k\u0304 =\n\nG \u00d7k,e k\u0304.\n\ne\u2208Homl (k,k\u0304)\n\nFrom (7) we easily get that:\n(*) if G is a reductive (resp. connected, smooth, affine, linear, unipotent,\ntorus, semisimple, or abelian variety) group over k, then Resk/l G is a reductive\n(resp. connected, smooth, affine, linear, unipotent, torus, semisimple, or abelian\nvariety) group over l.\nIf j : m \u0592\u2192 l is another separable finite field extension, then we have a\ncanonical and functorial identification\nResl/m Resk/l G = Resk/m G\nas one can easily check starting from formula (6).\nIf H is a group scheme over l, then we have a natural closed embedding\nhomomorphism\n(8)\n\nH \u0592\u2192 Resk/l Hk\n\nover l which at the level of l-valued points induces the standard monomorphism\nH(l) \u0592\u2192 H(k) = Resk/l Hk (l).\n5\n\n\f2.3. Hodge structures\nLet S := ResC/R Gm be the two dimensional torus over R whose group of Rvalued points is the multiplicative group (C \\ {0}, *) of C. As schemes, we have\n1\nS = Spec(R[x, y][ x2 +y\n2 ]). By applying (8) we get that we have a short exact\nsequence\n(9)\n\n0 \u2192 Gm \u2192 S \u2192 SO 2,R \u2192 0.\n\nThe group SO 2,R (R) is isomorphic to the unit circle and thus to R/Z. The short\n\u03bc2 ,\nexact sequence (9) does not split; this is so as S is isomorphic to (Gm \u00d7R SO2,R )/\u03bc\n\u03bc\nwhere 2 is embedded diagonally into the product.\nWe have S(R) = C \\ {0}. We identify S(C) = Gm (C) \u00d7 Gm (C) = (C \\ {0}) \u00d7\n(C \\ {0}) in such a way that the natural monomorphism S(R) \u0592\u2192 S(C) induces\nthe map z \u2192 (z, z), where z \u2208 C \\ {0}.\nLet S be a Z-subalgebra of R (in most applications, we have S \u2208 {Z, Q, R}).\nLet VS be a free S-module of finite rank. Let VR := VS \u2297S R. By a Hodge Sstructure on VS we mean a homomorphism\n(10)\n\n\u03c1 : S \u2192 GL VR .\n\nWe have a direct sum decomposition\n(11)\n\nVR \u2297R C = \u2295(r,s)\u2208Z2 V r,s\n\nwith the property that (z1 , z2 ) \u2208 S(C) acts via \u03c1C on V r,s as the scalar multiplication with z1\u2212r z2\u2212s . Thus the element z \u2208 S(R) acts via \u03c1 on V r,s as the scalar\nmultiplication with z \u2212r z\u0304 \u2212s . Therefore z acts on V r,s as the scalar multiplication\nwith z \u2212s z\u0304 \u2212r . This implies that for all (r, s) \u2208 Z2 we have an identity\n(12)\n\nV s,r = V r,s .\n\nConversely, each direct sum decomposition (11) that satisfies the identities (12),\nis uniquely associated to a homomorphism as in (10).\nBy the type of the Hodge S-structure on VS , we mean any symmetric subset\n\u03c4 of Z2 with the property that we have a direct sum decomposition\nVR \u2297R C = \u2295(r,s)\u2208\u03c4 V r,s .\nHere symmetric refers to the fact that if (r, s) \u2208 \u03c4 , then we also have (s, r) \u2208 \u03c4 .\nIf we can choose \u03c4 such that the sum n := r + s does not depend on (r, s) \u2208 \u03c4 ,\none says that the Hodge S-structure on VS has weight n.\n2.3.1. Polarizations\nFor n \u2208 Z, let S(n) be the Hodge S-structure on (2\u03c0i)n S which has type (\u2212n, \u2212n).\nSuppose that the Hodge S-structure on VS has weight n. By a polarization of the\nHodge S-structure on VS we mean a morphism \u03c8 : VS \u2297S VS \u2192 S(\u2212n) of Hodge\nS-structures such that the bilinear form (2\u03c0i)n \u03c8(x \u2297 \u03c1(i)y) defined for x, y \u2208 VR ,\nis symmetric and positive definite. Here we identify \u03c8 with its scalar extension to\nR.\n6\n\n\f2.3.2. Example\nLet A be an abelian variety over C. We take S = Z. Let VZ = H 1 (Aan , Z) be the\nfirst cohomology group of the analytic manifold Aan := A(C) with coefficients in\nZ. Then the classical Hodge theory provides us with a direct sum decomposition\n(13a)\n\nVR \u2297R C = V 1,0 \u2295 V 0,1 ,\n\nwhere V 1,0 = H 0 (A, \u03a9) and V 0,1 = H 1 (A, OA ) (see [Mu, Ch. I, 1]). Here OA\nis the structured ring sheaf on A and \u03a9 is the OA -module of 1-forms on A. We\nhave V 1,0 = V 0,1 and therefore (13a) defines a Hodge Z-structure on VS . Let\nF 1 (VR \u2297R C) := V 1,0 ; it is called the Hodge filtration of VR \u2297R C.\nLet WZ := Hom(VZ , Z) = H1 (Aan , Z). Let WR := WZ \u2297Z R. Taking the dual\nof (13a), we get a Hodge Z-structure on WZ of the form\n(13b)\n\nWR \u2297R C = W \u22121,0 \u2295 W 0,\u22121 .\n\nOne can identify naturally W \u22121,0 = Hom(V 1,0 , C) = Lie(A). Each z \u2208 S(R) acts\non the complex vector space Lie(A) as the multiplication with z and this explains\nthe convention on negative power signs used in the paragraph after formula (11).\nWe have canonical identifications\nAan = WZ \\ Lie(A) = WZ \\(WR \u2297R C)/W 0,\u22121 .\nIf \u03bb is a polarization of A, then the non-degenerate form\n(14)\n\n\u03c8 : WZ \u2297Z WZ \u2192 Z(1)\n\ndefined naturally by \u03bb, is a polarization of the Hodge Z-structure on WZ .\nWe have End(VZ ) = VZ \u2297Z WZ = End(WZ ). Due to the identities (13a) and\n(13b), the Hodge Z-structure on End(VZ ) is of type\n(15)\n\n\u03c4ab := {(\u22121, 1), (0, 0), (1, \u22121)}.\n\nDef inition 2. We use the notations of Example 2.3.1. Let W := WZ \u2297Z Q. By\nthe Mumford\u2013Tate group of the complex abelian variety A, we mean the smallest\nsubgroup HA of GL W with the property that the homomorphism xA : S \u2192 GL WR\nthat defines the Hodge Z-structure on WZ , factors through HA,R .\nProposition 1. The group HA is a reductive group over Q.\nProof: From its very definition, the group HA is connected. To prove the Propou\nsition it suffices to show that the unipotent radical HA\nof HA is trivial. Let W1\nu\nu\nbe the largest rational subspace of W on which HA acts trivially. As HA\nis a\nnormal subgroup of HA , W1 is an HA -module. Thus xA normalizes W1 \u2297Q R and\ntherefore we have a direct sum decomposition\nW1 \u2297Q C = [(W1 \u2297Q C) \u2229 W \u22121,0 ] \u2295 [(W1 \u2297Q C) \u2229 W 0,\u22121 ].\n7\n\n\fThus (WZ \u2229 W1 )\\(W1 \u2297Q C)/[(W1 \u2297Q C) \u2229 W 0,\u22121 ] is a closed analytic submanifold\nan\nan\nAan\n1 of A . A classical theorem of Serre asserts that A1 is algebraizable i.e.,\nit is the analytic submanifold associated to an abelian subvariety A1 of A. The\nshort exact sequence 0 \u2192 A1 \u2192 A \u2192 A/A1 \u2192 0 splits up to isogenies (i.e., A is\nisogeneous to A1 \u00d7C A2 , where A2 := A/A1 ). Let W2 := H1 (Aan\n2 , Q). We have a\ndirect sum decomposition W = W1 \u2295 W2 whose extension to R is normalized by\nxA . Thus the direct sum decomposition W = W1 \u2295 W2 is normalized by HA . In\nu\nparticular, W2 is an HA\n-module.\nu\nIf W1 6= W , then the unipotent group HA\nacts trivially on a non-zero subspace\nof W2 and this represents a contradiction with the largest property of W1 . Thus\nu\nu\nW1 = W i.e., HA\nacts trivially on W . Therefore HA\nis the trivial group.\n\u0003\n2.4. Tensors\nLet M be a free module of finite rank over a commutative Z-algebra C. Let\nM \u2217 := HomC (M, C). By the essential tensor algebra of M \u2295 M \u2217 we mean the\nC-module\nT (M ) := \u2295s,t\u2208N\u222a{0} M \u2297s \u2297C M \u2217\u2297t .\nLet F 1 (M ) be a direct summand of M . Let F 0 (M ) := M and F 2 (M ) := 0.\nLet F 1 (M \u2217 ) := 0, F 0 (M \u2217 ) := {y \u2208 M \u2217 |y(F 1 (M )) = 0}, and F \u22121 (M \u2217 ) :=\nM \u2217 . Let (F i (T (M )))i\u2208Z be the tensor product filtration of T (M ) defined by\nthe exhaustive, separated filtrations (F i (M ))i\u2208{0,1,2} and (F i (M \u2217 ))i\u2208{\u22121,0,1} of\nM and M \u2217 (respectively). We refer to (F i (T (M )))i\u2208Z as the filtration of T (M )\ndefined by F 1 (M ) and to each F i (T (M )) as the F i -filtration of T (M ) defined by\nF 1 (M ).\nWe identify naturally End(M ) = M \u2297C M \u2217 \u2286 T (M ) and End(End(M )) =\n\u22972\nM \u2297C M \u2217\u22972 . Let x \u2208 C be a non-divisor of 0. A family of tensors of T (M [ x1 ]) =\nT (M )[ x1 ] is denoted (u\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , with J as the set of indexes. Let M1 be another\nfree C-module of finite rank. Let (u1,\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J be a family of tensors of T (M1 [ x1 ])\nindexed also by the set J . By an isomorphism\n(M, (u\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )\u2192(M\n \u0303\n1 , (u1,\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J )\nwe mean a C-linear isomorphism M \u2192M\n \u0303 1 that extends naturally to a C-linear\n \u0303 (M1 [ x1 ]) which takes u\u03b1 to u1,\u03b1 for all \u03b1 \u2208 J . We\nisomorphism T (M [ x1 ])\u2192T\nemphasize that we will denote two tensors or bilinear forms in the same way,\nprovided they are obtained one from another via either a reduction modulo some\nideal or a scalar extension.\n2.5. Hodge cycles on abelian schemes\nWe will use the terminology of [De3] on Hodge cycles on an abelian scheme BX\nover a reduced Q\u2013scheme X. Thus we write each Hodge cycle v on BX as a\npair (vdR , v\u00e9t ), where vdR and v\u00e9t are the de Rham and the \u00e9tale component of\nl\nv (respectively). The \u00e9tale component v\u00e9t at its turn has an l-component v\u00e9t\n, for\neach rational prime l.\n8\n\n\fIn what follows we will be interested only in Hodge cycles on BX that involve\nno Tate twists and that are tensors of different essential tensor algebras. Accordl\ningly, if X is the spectrum of a field E, then in applications v\u00e9t\nwill be a suitable\n1\nGal(E/E)-invariant tensor of T (H\u00e9t (BX , Ql )), where X := Spec(E). If E is a\nsubfield of C, then we will also use the Betti realization vB of v. The tensor vB\nhas the following two properties (that define Hodge cycles on BX which involve\nno Tate twist; see [De3, Sect. 2]):\n(i) it is a tensor of T (H 1 ((BX \u00d7X Spec(C))an , Q)) that corresponds to vdR\nl\n(resp. to v\u00e9t\n) via the canonical isomorphism that relates the Betti cohomology of\n(BX \u00d7X Spec(C))an with Q\u2013coefficients with the de Rham (resp. the Ql \u00e9tale)\ncohomology of BX \u00d7X Spec(C);\n(ii) it is also a tensor of the F 0 -filtration of the filtration of T (H 1 ((BX \u00d7X\nSpec(C))an , C)) defined by the Hodge filtration F 1 (H 1 ((BX \u00d7X Spec(C))an , C))\nof H 1 ((BX \u00d7X Spec(C))an , C).\nWe have the following particular example:\n(iii) if vB \u2208 End(H 1 ((BX \u00d7X Spec(C))an , Q)), then from Riemann theorem\nwe get that vB is the Betti realization of a Q\u2013endomorphism of BX \u00d7X Spec(C)\nand therefore the Hodge cycle (vdR , v\u00e9t ) on BX is defined uniquely by a Q\u2013\nendomorphism of BX .\nThe class of Hodge cycles is stable under pull backs. In particular, if X is a\nreduced Q\u2013scheme of finite type, then the pull back of (vdR , v\u00e9t ) via a complex\npoint Spec(C) \u2192 X, is a Hodge cycle on the complex abelian variety BX \u00d7X\nSpec(C).\n2.5.1. Example\nLet A be an abelian variety over C. Let S be an irreducible, closed subvariety of A.\n2n\n(A/C),\nLet n be the codimension of S in A. To S one associates classes [S]dR \u2208 HdR\n2n\nan\n2n\n[S]l \u2208 H\u00e9t (A, Ql )(n), and [S]B \u2208 H (A , Q)(n). If [S]\u00e9t := ([S]l )l a prime ,\nthen the pair ([S]dR , [S]\u00e9t ) is a Hodge cycle on A which involves Tate twists\n2n\nand whose Betti realization is [S]B . One can identify H\u00e9t\n(A, Ql )(n) with a Ql 1\n\u2297n\n1\n\u2217 \u2297n\n2n\nsubspace of H\u00e9t (A, Ql ) \u2297Ql [(H\u00e9t (A, Ql )) ] and HdR (A/C) with a C-subspace\n1\n1\nof HdR\n(A/C)\u2297n \u2297C [(HdR\n(A/C))\u2217 ]\u2297n ; thus one can naturally view ([S]dR , [S]\u00e9t )\nas a Hodge cycle on A which involves no Tate twists. The Q\u2013linear combinations\nof such cycles ([S]dR , [S]\u00e9t ) are called algebraic cycles on A.\n3. Shimura varieties\nIn this section we introduce Shimura varieties and their basic properties and\nmain types. All continuous actions are in the sense of [De2, Subsubsect. 2.7.1]\nand are right actions. Thus if a totally discontinuous, locally compact group \u0393\nacts continuously (from the right) on a scheme Y , then for each compact, open\nsubgroup \u2206 of \u0393 the geometric quotient scheme Y /\u2206 exists and the epimorphism\nY \u0589 Y /\u2206 is pro-finite; moreover, we have an identity Y = proj.lim.\u2206 Y /\u2206.\n9\n\n\f3.1. Shimura pairs\nA Shimura pair (G, X ) consists of a reductive group G over Q and a G(R)conjugacy class X of homomorphisms S \u2192 GR that satisfy Deligne's axioms of\n[De2, Subsubsect. 2.1.1]:\n(i) the Hodge Q\u2013structure on Lie(G) defined by each element x \u2208 X is of\ntype \u03c4ab = {(\u22121, 1), (0, 0), (1, \u22121)};\n(ii) no simple factor of the adjoint group Gad of G becomes compact over R;\n(iii) Ad(x(i)) is a Cartan involution of Lie(Gad\nR ), where Ad : GR \u2192 GL Lie(Gad\nR )\nis the adjoint representation.\nAxiom (iii) is equivalent to the fact that the adjoint group Gad\nR has a faithful\nrepresentation Gad\n\u0592\u2192\nGL\nwith\nthe\nproperty\nthat\nthere\nexists\na\npolarization of\nVR\nR\nthe Hodge R-structure on VR defined naturally by any x \u2208 X which is fixed by\nGad\nR . These axioms imply that X has a natural structure of a hermitian symmetric\ndomain, cf. [De2, Cor. 1.1.17].\nFor x \u2208 X we consider the Hodge cocharacter\n\u03bcx : Gm \u2192 GC\ndefined on complex points by the rule: z \u2208 Gm (C) is mapped to xC (z, 1) \u2208 GC (C).\nLet E(G, X ) \u0592\u2192 C be the number subfield of C that is the field of definition\nof the G(C)-conjugacy class [\u03bcX ] of the cocharacters \u03bcx 's of GC , cf. [Mi2, p.\n163]. More precisely [\u03bcX ] is defined naturally by a G(Q)-conjugacy class [\u03bcQ\nX ] of\ncocharacters Gm \u2192 GQ ; the Galois group Gal(Q) acts naturally on the set of such\nG(Q)-conjugacy classes and E(G, X ) is the number field which is the fixed field\nof the stabilizer subgroup of [\u03bcQ\nX ] in Gal(Q). One calls E(G, X ) the reflex field of\n(G, X ).\nWe define the complex Shimura space\nSh(G, X )C := proj.lim.K\u2208\u03c3(G) G(Q)\\(X \u00d7 G(Af )/K),\nwhere \u03c3(G) is the set of compact, open subgroups of G(Af ) endowed with the\ninclusion relation (see [De1], [De2], and [Mi1] to [Mi4]). Thus Sh(G, X )C (C) is a\nnormal complex space on which G(Af ) acts. We have an identity\n(16)\n\nSh(G, X )C (C) = G(Q)\\[X \u00d7 (G(Af )/Z(G)(Q))],\n\nwhere Z(G)(Q) is the topological closure of Z(G)(Q) in G(Af ) (cf. [De2, Prop.\n2.1.10]). Let x \u2208 X and a, g \u2208 G(Af ). Let [x, a] \u2208 Sh(G, X )C (C) be the point\ndefined naturally by the equivalence class of (x, a) \u2208 X \u00d7 G(Af ), cf. (16). The\nG(Af )-action on Sh(G, X )C (C) is defined by the rule [x, a] * g := [x, ag].\nFor \u2021 a compact subgroup of G(Af ) let Sh\u2021 (G, X )C (C) := Sh(G, X )C (C)/\u2021.\nLet K \u2208 \u03c3(G). We can write ShK (G, X )C (C) = G(Q)\\(X \u00d7G(Af )/K) as a disjoint\nunion of normal complex spaces of the form \u03a3\\X 0 , where X 0 is a connected\n10\n\n\fcomponent of X and \u03a3 is an arithmetic subgroup of G(Q) (i.e., is the intersection\nof G(Q) with a compact, open subgroup of G(Af )). A classical result of Baily and\nBorel allows us to view naturally ShK (G, X )C (C) = G(Q)\\(X \u00d7 G(Af )/K) as the\ncomplex space associated to a finite, disjoint union ShK (G, X )C of normal, quasiprojective, connected varieties over C (see [BB, Thm. 10.11]). Thus ShK (G, X )C\nis a normal, quasi-projective C-scheme and\nSh(G, X )C := proj.lim.K\u2208\u03c3(G) ShK (G, X )C\nis a normal C-scheme on which G(Af ) acts. We have a canonical identification ShK (G, X )C = Sh(G, X )C /K. If K is small enough, then K acts freely on\nSh(G, X )C and thus ShK (G, X )C is in fact a smooth, quasi-projective C-scheme.\n3.1.1. Example\nLet A be an abelian variety over C. Let HA be its Mumford\u2013Tate group. Let\nxA : S \u2192 HA,R be the homomorphism that defines the Hodge Z-structure on\nWA := H1 (Aan , Z), cf. Definition 2. Let XA be the HA (R)-conjugacy class of xA .\nWe check that the pair (HA , XA ) is a Shimura pair. The fact that the axiom 3.1\nad\n(i) holds for (HA , XA ) is implied by (15). If HA\nhas a (non-trivial) simple factor \u22c4\nwhich over R is compact, then the fact that XA is a hermitian symmetric domain\nimplies that the image of xA in \u22c4R is trivial and this contradicts the smallest\nproperty (see Definition 2) of the Mumford\u2013Tate group HA . Thus the axioms 3.1\n(ii) holds for (HA , XA ). The fact that the axioms 3.1 (iii) holds is implied by the\nfact that B has a polarization and thus by the fact that (14) holds. We emphasize\nthat the reflex field E(HA , XA ) can be any CM number field.\n3.1.2. Example\nThe most studied Shimura pairs are constructed as follows. Let W be a vector\nspace over Q of even dimension 2r. Let \u03c8 be a non-degenerate alternative form on\nW . Let S be the set of all monomorphisms S \u0592\u2192 GSp\nGSp(W \u2297Q R, \u03c8) that define Hodge\nQ\u2013structures on W of type {(\u22121, 0), (0, \u22121)} and that have either 2\u03c0i\u03c8 or \u22122\u03c0i\u03c8\nas polarizations. Thus S is two copies of the Siegel domain of genus r (the two\ncopies correspond to either 2\u03c0i\u03c8 or \u22122\u03c0i\u03c8 being a polarization of the resulting\nHodge Q\u2013structures on W ). It is easy to see that S is a GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8)(R)-conjugacy\nclass of homomorphisms S \u2192 GSp\nGSp(W \u2297Q R, \u03c8). One can choose an abelian variety\nGSp\nA over C such that in fact we have (GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) = (HA , XA ) and therefore\nGSp\nGSp\n(GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) is a Shimura pair, cf. Example 3.1.1. We call (GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) a\nGSp\nShimura pair that defines a Siegel modular variety Sh(GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) (to be defined in Subsection 3.2 below). As GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8) is a split group, the GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8)(Q)Q\nconjugacy class [\u03bcX ] is defined naturally by a cocharacter of GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8) and thereGSp\nfore we have E(GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) = Q.\n3.1.3. Example\nLet n be a positive integer. Let G := SO\nSO(2, n); it is the identity component of\nthe group that fixes the quadratic from \u2212x21 \u2212 x22 + x23 + * * * + x2n+2 on Qn+2 .\nThe group G has a subgroup SO 2 \u00d7Q SO n which normalizes the rational vector\n11\n\n\fsubspaces of Qn+2 generated by the first two and by the last n vectors of the\nstandard Q\u2013basis for Qn+2 . Let x : S \u2192 GR be a homomorphism whose image is\nthe subgroup SO 2,R of GR and whose kernel is the split torus Gm of S. Let X be\nthe G(R)-conjugacy class of x. Then the pair (G, X ) is a Shimura pair.\n[n]\nThe group GQ(i) is split (i.e., Gm2 is a subgroup of it) and thus the G(Q)conjugacy class [\u03bcQ\nX ] is defined naturally by a cocharacter \u03bc0 : Gm \u2192 GQ(i) . We\ncan choose \u03bc0 such that the non-trivial element of Gal(Q(i)/Q) takes \u03bc0 under\n\u22121\nGalois conjugation to \u03bc\u22121\n0 . It is easy to see that the two cocharacters \u03bc0 and \u03bc0\nare G(Q(i))-conjugate. Therefore E(G, X ) = Q.\nIf n = 19, then (G, X ) is the Shimura pair associated to moduli spaces of\npolarized K3 surfaces.\n3.1.4. Example\nLet T be a torus over Q. Let x : S \u2192 TR be an arbitrary homomorphism. Then\nthe pair (T, {x}) is a Shimura pair. Its reflex field E := E(T, {x}) is the field of\ndefinition of the cocharacter \u03bcx : Gm \u2192 TC . We denote also by \u03bcx : Gm \u2192 TE\nthe homomorphism whose extension to C is \u03bcx .\nFrom the homomorphism \u03bcx : Gm \u2192 TE we get naturally a new one\nNx : ResE/Q Gm\n\nResE/Q (\u03bcx )\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nResE/Q TE\n\nNorm E/Q\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nT.\n\nThus for each commutative Q\u2013algebra C we get a homomorphism Nx (C) :\nGm (E \u2297Q C) \u2192 T (C).\nLet E ab be the maximal abelian extension of E. The reciprocity map\nr(T, {x}) : Gal(E ab /E) \u2192 T (Af )/T (Q)\nis defined as follows: if \u03c4 \u2208 Gal(E ab /E) and if s \u2208 JE is an id\u00e8le (of E) such\nthat recE (s) = \u03c4 , then r(T, {x})(\u03c4 ) := Nx (Af )(sf ), where sf is the finite part of\ns. Here the Artin reciprocity map recE is such that a uniformizing parameter is\nmapped to the geometric Frobenius element.\nDef inition 3. By a map f : (G1 , X1 ) \u2192 (G2 , X2 ) of Shimura pairs we mean a\nhomomorphism f : G1 \u2192 G2 of groups over Q such that for each x \u2208 X1 we\nhave f (x) := fR \u25e6 x \u2208 X2 . If f : G1 \u2192 G2 is a monomorphism, then we say\nf : (G1 , X1 ) \u2192 (G2 , X2 ) is an injective map. If G1 is a torus and if f : (G1 , X1 ) \u0592\u2192\n(G2 , X2 ) is an injective map, then f is called a special pair in (G2 , X2 ).\n3.2. Canonical models\nBy a model of Sh(G, X )C over a subfield k of C, we mean a scheme S over k\nendowed with a continuous right action of G(Af ) (defined over k), such that there\nexists a G(Af )-equivariant isomorphism\nSh(G, X )C \u2192S\n \u0303 C.\n12\n\n\fThe canonical model of Sh(G, X )C (or of (G, X ) itself) is the model Sh(G, X )\nof Sh(G, X )C over E(G, X ) which satisfies the following property:\n(*) if (T, {x}) is a special pair in (G, X ), then for each element a \u2208 G(Af )\nthe point [x, a] of Sh(G, X )(C) = Sh(G, X )C (C) is rational over E(T, {x})ab and\nevery element \u03c4 of Gal(E(T, {x})ab /E(T, {x})) acts on [x, a] according to the rule\n\u03c4 [x, a] = [x, ar(\u03c4 )],\nwhere r := r(T, {x}) is as in Example 3.1.4.\nThe canonical model of Sh(G, X ) exists and is uniquely determined by the\nproperty (*) up to a unique isomorphism (see [De1], [De2], [Mi2], and [Mi4]).\nBy the dimension d of Sh(G, X ) (or (G, X ) or Sh(G, X )C ) we mean the dimension of X as a complex manifold. One computes d as follows. For x \u2208 X , let\nLie(GC ) = Fx\u22121,0 \u2295 Fx0,0 \u2295 Fx0,\u22121 be the Hodge decomposition defined by x. Let\nK\u221e be the centralizer of x in GR ; it is a reductive group over R (cf. [Bo, Ch. IV,\n13.17, Cor. 2]). We have Lie(K\u221e ) \u2297R C = Fx0,0 and (as analytic real manifolds)\nX = [G(R)]/[K\u221e (R)]. Thus as dimC (F \u22121,0 ) = dimC (F 0,\u22121 ), we get that\n(17)\n1\n1\nd = dim(GR /K\u221e ) = dimC (Lie(GC )/Fx0,0 ) = dimC (Fx\u22121,0 ) = dimC (Fx0,\u22121 ).\n2\n2\nFor \u2021 a compact subgroup of G(Af ) let Sh\u2021 (G, X ) := Sh(G, X )/\u2021. If K \u2208\n\u03c3(G), then ShK (G, X ) is a normal, quasi-projective E(G, X )-scheme which is\nequidimensional of dimension d and whose extension to C is (canonically identified\nwith) the C-scheme ShK (G, X )C we have introduced in Subsection 3.1.\nIf f : (G1 , X1 ) \u2192 (G2 , X2 ) is a map between two Shimura pairs, then\nE(G2 , X2 ) is a subfield of E(G1 , X1 ) and there exists a unique G1 (Af )-equivariant\nmorphism (still denoted by f )\n(18)\n\nf : Sh(G1 , X1 ) \u2192 Sh(G2 , X2 )E(G1 ,X1 )\n\nwhich at the level of complex points is the map [x, a] \u2192 [f (x), f (a)] ([De1, Cor.\n5.4]). We get as well a G(Af )-equivariant morphism (denoted in the same way)\nf : Sh(G1 , X1 ) \u2192 Sh(G2 , X2 )\nof E(G2 , X2 )-schemes. If f is an injective map, then based on (16) one gets that\n(18) is in fact a closed embedding.\n3.3. Classification of Shimura pairs\nad\nLet (G, X ) be a Shimura pair. If x \u2208 X , let xab : S \u2192 Gab\n: S \u2192 Gad\nR and x\nR be\nthe homomorphisms defined naturally by x : S \u2192 GR . The homomorphism xab\ndoes not depend on x \u2208 X and the Shimura pair (Gab , {xab }) has dimension 0.\nLet X ad be the Gad (R)-conjugacy class of xad . The Shimura pairs (Gab , {xab })\nand (Gad , X ad ) are called the toric and the adjoint (respectively) Shimura pairs of\n\n13\n\n\f(G, X ). The centralizer K\u221e,ad of xad in Gad\nR is a reductive group over R which is\na maximal compact subgroup of Gad\nR . The hermitian symmetric domain structure\non X ad is obtained via the natural identification X ad = [Gad (R)]/[K\u221e,ad (R)].\nThe hermitian symmetric domain X is a finite union of connected components of\nX ad . In particular, we have X \u2286 X ad .\nWe have a product decomposition\n(19)\n\n(Gad , X ad ) =\n\nY\n(Gi , Xi )\ni\u2208I\n\ninto simple adjoint Shimura pairs, where each Gi is a simple group over Q. For\neach i \u2208 I there exists a number field Fi such that we have an isomorphism\nFi\nFi\nGi \u2192Res\n \u0303\nFi /Q Gi , where Gi is an absolutely simple adjoint group over Fi (see [Ti,\nSubsubsect. 3.1.2]). The number field Fi is uniquely determined up to Gal(Q)conjugation (i.e., up to isomorphism).\nAxiom 3.2 (iii) is equivalent to the fact that Gad\nR is an inner form of its compact\nad,c\nad\nform GR , cf. [De2, p. 255]. Thus GR is a product of absolutely simple, adjoint\nFi\ngroups over R. But for each i \u2208 I we have Gi,R \u2192Res\n \u0303\nFi \u2297Q R/R [Gi \u00d7Fi (Fi \u2297Q R)].\nFrom the last two sentences, we get that for each i \u2208 I the R-algebra Fi \u2297Q R is\nisomorphic to a finite number of copies of R. In other words, for each i \u2208 I the\nnumber field Fi is totally real.\nWe have the following conclusions of the last three paragraphs:\n(i) Let G be a reductive group over Q. To give a Shimura pair (G, X ) is\nthe same thing as to give a Shimura pair (Gab , {xab }) of dimension 0 (i.e., a\nad\nad\nhomomorphism xab : S \u2192 Gab\nR ) and an adjoint Shimura pair (G , X ), with the\nproperties that for an (any) element xad \u2208 X ad the homomorphism (xab , xad ) :\nad\nab\nad\nS \u2192 Gab\nR \u00d7R GR lifts to a homomorphism x : S \u2192 GR , where GR \u2192 GR \u00d7R GR\nis the standard isogeny. One takes X to be the G(R)-conjugacy class of x. We\nemphasize that the Shimura pair (G, X ) can depend on the choice of xad \u2208 X ad\n(though its isomorphism class does not).\n(ii) To give an adjoint Shimura pair (Gad , X ad ) is the same thing as to give\na finite set (Gi , Xi ) of simple adjoint Shimura pairs, cf. (19).\n(iii) To give a simple adjoint Shimura pair (Gi , Xi ), one has to first give a\ni\ntotally real number field Fi and an absolutely simple, adjoint group GF\ni over Fi\nthat satisfies the following property:\ni\n(*) for each embedding j : Fi \u0592\u2192 R, the group GF\ni \u00d7Fi ,j R is either compact\n(and then one defines Xi,j to be a set with one element) or is not compact and\nassociated naturally to a connected hermitian symmetric domain Xi,j .\n\nQ\nThe product j\u2208Hom(Fi ,R) Xi,j is a connected hermitian symmetric domain isoi\nmorphic to the connected components of Xi . If GF\ni,C is of classical Lie type and if\nFi\ni\nSU(a, b)ad\nGF\nR\ni \u00d7Fi ,j R is not compact, then Gi \u00d7Fi ,j R is isomorphic to either SU\nad\nad\nwith a, b \u2265 1, or SO\nSO(2, n)R with n \u2265 1, or Sp 2n,R with n \u2265 1, or SO \u2217 (2n)ad\nR\n14\n\n\fwith n \u2265 4. The last think one has to give is a family of homomorphisms\ni\nxi,j : S/Gm \u2192 GF\ni \u00d7Fi ,j R, where\ni\n\u2022 xi,j is trivial if GF\ni \u00d7Fi ,j R is compact, and\n\n\u2022 xi,j identifies S/Gm = SO 2,R with the identity component of the center of\nFi\ni\na maximal compact subgroup of GF\ni \u00d7Fi ,j R if Gi \u00d7Fi ,j R is not compact.\nOne takes Xi to be the Gi (R)-conjugacy\nclass of the composite of the natural\nQ\ni\nepimorphism S \u0589 S/Gm with j\u2208Hom(Fi ,R) xi,j : S/Gm \u2192 Gi,R . Once Fi and GF\ni\nare given, there exist a finite number of possibilities for Xi (they correspond to\npossible replacements of some of the xi,j 's by their inverses).\n3.3.1. Shimura types\nA Shimura variety Sh(G1 , X1 ) is called unitary if the adjoint group Gad\n1 is nontrivial and all simple factors of Gad\nare\nPGL\ngroups\nover\nC.\n1,C\nLet (G, X ) be a simple, adjoint Shimura pair. Let L be the Lie type of anyone\nof the simple factors of GC . If L is either An , Bn , Cn , E6 , or E7 , then one say\nthat (G, X ) is of L Shimura type. If L is Dn with n \u2265 4, then there exist three\ndisjoint possibilities for the type of (G, X ): they are DnH , DnR , and Dnmixed. If n \u2265 5,\nthen (G, X ) is of DnH (resp. of DnR ) Shimura type if and only if each simple, noncompact factor of GR is isomorphic to SO \u2217 (2n)ad\nSO(2, 2n \u2212 2)ad\nR (resp. to SO\nR ). The\nonly if part of the previous sentence holds even if n = 4.\nWe will not detail here the precise difference between the Shimura types D4H ,\nR\nD4 , and D4mixed (see [De2, p. 272]).\n3.4. Shimura varieties of Hodge type\nLet (G, X ) be a Shimura pair. We say that Sh(G, X ) (or (G, X )) is of Hodge type,\nGSp\nif there exists an injective map f : (G, X ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) into a Shimura\npair that defines a Siegel modular variety. The Hodge Q\u2013structure on W defined\nby any x \u2208 X is of type {(\u22121, 0), (0, \u22121)}, cf. (13b). This implies that x(Gm )\nis the group of scalar automorphisms of GL W \u2297Q R . Therefore Z(G) contains the\nGLW ) of scalar automorphisms of W . The image of Z(G)R in\ngroup Gm = Z(GL\nGSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8)ad\nGSp(W, \u03c8)ad\nR is contained in the centralizer of the image of x in GSp\nR and\nthus it is contained in a compact group. From the last two sentences we get that\nwe have a short exact sequence\n(20)\n\n0 \u2192 Gm \u2192 Z(G) \u2192 Z(G)c \u2192 0,\n\nwhere Z(G)cR is a compact group of multiplicative type. In this way we get the\nonly if part of the following Proposition (see [De2, Prop. 2.3.2 or Cor. 2.3.4]).\nProposition 2. A Shimura pair (G, X ) is of Hodge type if and only if the following\ntwo properties hold:\n(i) there exists a faithful representation G \u0592\u2192 GL W with the property that the\nHodge Q\u2013structure on W defined by a (any) x \u2208 X is of type {(\u22121, 0), (0, \u22121)};\n(ii) we have a short exact sequence as in (20).\n15\n\n\fIf (G, X ) is of Hodge type, then (16) becomes (cf. [De2, Cor. 2.1.11])\nSh(G, X )(C) = G(Q)\\(X \u00d7 G(Af )).\n3.4.1. Moduli interpretation\nGSp\nLet f : (G, X ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) be an injective map. We fix a family (s\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J\nof tensors of T (W \u2217 ) such that G is the subgroup of GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8) that fixes s\u03b1 for\nall \u03b1 \u2208 J , cf. [De3, Prop. 3.1 (c)]. Let L be a Z-lattice of W such that we have\na perfect form \u03c8 : L \u2297Z L \u2192 Z. We follow [Va1, Subsect. 4.1] to present the\nstandard moduli interpretation of the complex Shimura variety Sh(G, X )C with\nrespect to the Z-lattice L of W and the family of tensors (s\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J .\nWe consider quadruples of the form [A, \u03bbA , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , k] where:\n(a) (A, \u03bbA ) is a principally polarized abelian variety over C;\n(b) (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J is a family of Hodge cycles on A;\nb whose tensorization with\nb \u2192L\n \u0303 \u2297Z Z\n(c) k is an isomorphism H1 (Aan , Z) \u2297Z Z\nQ (denoted also by k) takes the Betti realization of v\u03b1 into s\u03b1 for all \u03b1 \u2208 J and\nb \u03bbA )\nwhich induces a symplectic similitude isomorphism between (H1 (Aan , Z)\u2297Z Z,\nb\nand (L \u2297Z Z, \u03c8).\nWe define A(G, X , W, \u03c8) to be the set of isomorphism classes of quadruples\nof the above form that satisfy the following two conditions:\n\n(i) there exists a similitude isomorphism (H1 (Aan , Q), \u03bbA )\u2192(W,\n \u0303\n\u03c8) that takes\nthe Betti realization of v\u03b1 into s\u03b1 for all \u03b1 \u2208 J ;\n(ii) by composing the homomorphism xA : S \u2192 GSp\nGSp(H1 (Aan , R), \u03bbA ) that\nan\ndefines the Hodge R-structure on H1 (A , R) with an isomorphism of real groups\nGSp\nGSp(H1 (Aan , R), \u03bbA )\u2192GSp\n \u0303 GSp\nGSp(W \u2297Q R, \u03c8) induced naturally by an isomorphism as\nin (i), we get an element of X .\nWe have a right action of G(Af ) on A(G, X , W, \u03c8) defined by the rule:\n[A, \u03bbA , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , k] * g := [A\u2032 , \u03bbA\u2032 , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , g \u22121 k].\nHere A\u2032 is the abelian variety which is isogeneous to A and which is defined by the\nb\nZ-lattice H1 (A\u2032,an , Z) of H1 (A\u2032,an , Q) = H1 (Aan , Q) whose tensorization with Z\n\u22121\nb while \u03bbA\u2032 is the only rational multiple of \u03bbA which produces\nis (k \u25e6 g)(L \u2297Z Z),\na principal polarization of A\u2032 (see [De1, Thm. 4.7] for the theorem of Riemann\nused here). Here as well as in (e) below, we will identify a polarization with its\nBetti realization.\nThere exists a G(Af )-equivariant bijection\nf(G,X ,W,\u03c8) : Sh(G, X )(C)\u2192A(G,\n \u0303\nX , W, \u03c8)\ndefined as follows. To [x, g] \u2208 Sh(G, X )(C) = G(Q) \\ (X \u00d7 G(Af )) we associate\nthe quadruple f(G,X ,W,\u03c8)([x, g]) := [A, \u03bbA , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , k] where:\n16\n\n\f(d) A is associated to the Hodge Q\u2013structure on W defined by x and to the\nunique Z-lattice H1 (Aan , Z) of H1 (Aan , Q) = W for which we have an isomorb induced naturally by the automorb \u2192L\n \u0303 \u2297Z Z\nphism k = g \u22121 : H1 (Aan , Z) \u2297Z Z\n\u22121\nan\nphism g of W \u2297Q Af ; thus we have A = H1 (Aan , Z)\\(W \u2297Q C)/Wx0,\u22121 , where\nW \u2297Q C = Wx\u22121,0 \u2295 Wx0,\u22121 is the Hodge decomposition defined by x;\n(e) \u03bbA is the only rational multiple of \u03c8 which gives birth to a principal\npolarization of A;\n(f ) for each \u03b1 \u2208 J , the Betti realization of v\u03b1 is s\u03b1 .\nThe inverse g(G,X ,W,\u03c8) of f(G,X ,W,\u03c8) is defined as follows. We consider a\nquadruple [A, \u03bbA , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , k] \u2208 A(G, X , W, \u03c8). We choose a symplectic similitude\nisomorphism iA : (H1 (Aan , Q), \u03bbA )\u2192(W,\n \u0303\n\u03c8) as in (i). It gives birth naturally to\nan isomorphism \u0129A : GSp\nGSp(H1 (Aan , Q), \u03bbA ) \u2192 GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8) of groups over Q. We\ndefine x \u2208 X to be \u0129A,R \u25e6 xA (with xA as in Definition 2) and g \u2208 G(Af ) to be the\niA \u22971Af\n\nk\u22121\n\ncomposite isomorphism W \u2297Q Af \u2212\u2192 H1 (Aan , Q) \u2297Q Af \u2212\u2192 W \u2297Q Af . Then\ng(G,X ,W,\u03c8)([A, \u03bbA , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , k]) := [x, g].\nGSp\nTaking (G, X ) = (GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) and J = \u2205, we get a bijection between\nGSp\nthe set Sh(GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S)(C) and the set of isomorphism classes of principally\npolarized abelian varieties over C of dimension 12 dimQ (W ) that have (compatibly) level-N symplectic similitude structures for all positive integers N . Thus to\nGSp\ngive a C-valued point of Sh(GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) is the same thing as to give a triple\n[A, \u03bbA , (lN )N \u2208N ], where (A, \u03bbA ) is a principally polarized abelian variety over C\n \u0303 1 (Aan , Z/N Z), \u03bbA )'s are\nof dimension 12 dimQ (W ) and where lN : (L/N L, \u03c8)\u2192(H\nforming a compatible system of symplectic similitude isomorphisms. The compatibility means here that if N1 and N2 are positive integers such that N1 |N2 , then\nlN1 is obtained from lN2 by tensoring with Z/N1 Z.\n3.4.2. Canonical models\nLet r := 12 dimQ (W ) \u2208 N. Let N \u2265 3 be a positive integer. Let Ar,1,N be the\nMumford\u2013moduli scheme over Z[ N1 ] that parametrizes isomorphism classes of\nprincipally polarized abelian schemes over Z[ N1 ]-schemes that have level-N symplectic similitude structure and that have relative dimension r, cf. [MFK, Thms.\n7.9 and 7.10]. We consider the Q\u2013scheme\nAr,1,all := proj.lim.N \u2208N Ar,1,N .\nGSp\nWe have a natural identification Sh(GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S)(C) = Ar,1,all (C) of sets,\ncf. end of Subsubsection 3.4.1. One can easily check that this identification is\nin fact an isomorphism of complex manifolds. From the very definition of the\nGSp\nalgebraic structure on Sh(GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S)C (obtained based on [BB, Thm. 10.11]),\nGSp\none gets that there exists a natural identification Sh(GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S)C = Ar,1,all,C\nof C-schemes. Classical works of Shimura, Taniyama, etc., show that the last\nGSp\nidentification is the extension to C of an identification Sh(GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) = Ar,1,all\nof Q\u2013schemes.\n17\n\n\fThe reflex field E(G, X ) is the smallest number field such that the closed\nGSp\nsubscheme Sh(G, X )C of Sh(GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S)C is defined over E(G, X ). In other\nwords, we have a natural closed embedding (cf. end of Subsection 3.2)\nGSp\nf : Sh(G, X ) \u0592\u2192 Ar,1,all,E(G,X ) = Sh(GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S)E(G,X ) .\n\n(21)\n\nThe pull back (V, \u039bV ) to Sh(G, X ) of the universal principally polarized abelian\nscheme over Ar,1,all,E(G,X ) is such that there exists naturally a family of Hodge\ncycles (v\u03b1V )\u03b1\u2208J on the abelian scheme V.\nIf y := [x, g] \u2208 Sh(G, X )(C) and if f(G,X ,W,\u03c8)([x, g]) = [A, \u03bbA , (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , k],\nthen each y \u2217 (v\u03b1V ) is the Hodge cycle v\u03b1 on A = y \u2217 (V).\nDef inition 4. Let (G1 , X1 ) be a Shimura pair. We say that (G1 , X1 ) is of preabelian\ntype, if there exists a Shimura pair (G, X ) of Hodge type such that we have an\nad\nisomorphism (Gad , X ad )\u2192(G\n \u0303 ad\n1 , X1 ) of adjoint Shimura pairs. If moreover this\nad\nad\nad\nad\nisomorphism (G , X )\u2192(G\n \u0303 1 , X1 ) is induced naturally by an isogeny Gder \u2192\nder\nG1 , then we say that (G1 , X1 ) is of abelian type.\nRemark 1. Let (G1 , X1 ) be an arbitrary Shimura variety. Let \u03c11 : G1 \u0592\u2192 GL W1 be\na faithful representation. As in Subsubsection 3.4.1, one checks that Sh(G1 , X1 )C\nis a moduli space of Hodge Q\u2013structures on W1 equipped with extra structures. If\nmoreover (G1 , X1 ) is of abelian type, then Sh(G1 , X1 )C is in fact a moduli scheme\nof polarized abelian motives endowed with Hodge cycles and certain compatible\nsystems of level structures (cf. [Mi3]).\n3.4.3. Classification\nLet (G1 , X1 ) be a simple, adjoint Shimura pair. Then (G1 , X1 ) is of abelian type if\nand only if (G1 , X1 ) is of An , Bn , Cn , DnH , or DnR Shimura type. For this classical\nresult due to Satake and Deligne we refer to [Sa1], [Sa2, Part III], and [De2,\nTable 2.3.8]. There exists a Shimura pair (G, X ) of Hodge type whose adjoint is\nisomorphic to (G1 , X1 ) and whose derived group Gder is simply connected if and\nonly if (G1 , X1 ) is of An , Bn , Cn , or DnR Shimura type (cf. [De2, Table 2.3.8]).\n4. Integral models\nIn this Section we follow [Mi2] and [Va1] to define different integral models of\nShimura varieties. Let p \u2208 N be a prime. Let Z(p) be the location of Z at its prime\n(p)\nideal (p). Let Af be the ring of finite ad\u00e8les with the p-component omitted; we\n(p)\n\nhave Af = Qp \u00d7 Af . Let (G, X ) be a Shimura pair. Let v be a prime of E(G, X )\nthat divides p. Let O(v) be the local ring of v.\n4.1. Basic definitions\n(a) Let H be a compact, open subgroup of G(Qp ). By an integral model of\nShH (G, X ) over O(v) we mean a faithfully flat scheme N over O(v) together with\n(p)\n\n(p)\n\na G(Af )-continuous action on it and a G(Af )-equivariant isomorphism\n18\n\n\fNE(G,X )\u2192\n \u0303 ShH (G, X ).\n(p)\n\nWhen the G(Af )-action on N is obvious, by abuse of language, we say that the\nO(v) -scheme N is an integral model. The integral model N is said to be smooth\n(p)\n(resp. normal) if there exists a compact, open subgroup H0 of G(Af ) such that\nfor every inclusion H2 \u2286 H1 of compact, open subgroups of H0 , the natural\nmorphism N /H2 \u2192 N /H1 is a finite \u00e9tale morphism between smooth schemes\n(resp. between normal schemes) of finite type over O(v) . In other words, there\n(p)\nexists a compact open subgroup H0 of G(Af ) such that N is a pro-\u00e9tale cover\nof the smooth (resp. the normal) scheme N /H0 of finite type over O(v) .\n(b) A regular, faithfully flat O(v) -scheme Y is called p-healthy (resp. healthy)\nregular, if for each open subscheme U of Y which contains YQ and all points of\nY of codimension 1, every p-divisible group (resp. every abelian scheme) over U\nextends uniquely to a p-divisible group (resp. extends to an abelian scheme) over\nY.\n(c) A scheme Z over O(v) is said to have the extension property if for each\nhealthy regular scheme Y over O(v) , every E(G, X )-morphism YE(G,X ) \u2192 ZE(G,X )\nextends uniquely to an O(v) -morphism Y \u2192 Z.\n(d) A smooth integral model of ShH (G, X ) over O(v) that has the extension\nproperty is called an integral canonical model of Sh(G, X )/H over O(v) .\n(e) Let D be a Dedekind domain. Let K be the field of fractions of D. Let\nZK be a smooth scheme of finite type over K. By a N\u00e9ron model of ZK over\nD we mean a smooth scheme of finite type Z over D whose generic fibre is ZK\nand which is uniquely determined by the following universal property: for each\nsmooth scheme Y over D, every K-morphism YK \u2192 ZK extends uniquely to a\nD-morphism Y \u2192 Z.\n(f ) The group GQp is called unramified if and only if extends to a reductive group scheme GZp over Zp . In such a case, each compact, open subgroup of\nGQp (Qp ) of the form GZp (Zp ) is called a hyperspecial subgroup of GQp (Qp ).\n(g) Let Z be a flat O(v) -scheme and let Y be a closed subscheme of Zk(v) . The\ndilatation W of Z centered on Y is an affine Z-scheme defined as follows. To define\nW , we can work locally in the Zariski topology of Z and therefore we van assume\nthat Z = Spec(C) is an affine scheme. Let I be the ideal of C that defines Y and\nlet \u03c0v be a uniformizer of O(v) . Then W is the spectrum of the C-subalgebra of\nC[ \u03c01v ] generated by \u03c0iv with i \u2208 I. The affine morphism W \u2192 Z of O(v) -schemes\nenjoys the following universal property. Let q : Z\u0303 \u2192 Z be a morphism of flat\nO(v) -schemes. Then q factors uniquely through a morphism Z\u0303 \u2192 W of Z-schemes\nif and only if qk(v) : Z\u0303k(v) \u2192 Zk(v) factors through Y (i.e., qk(v) is a composite\nmorphism Z\u0303k(v) \u2192 Y \u0592\u2192 Zk(v) ).\n4.2. Classical example\nGSp\nLet f : (G, X ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) be an injective map. Let L be a Z-lattice of\nW such that \u03c8 induces a perfect form \u03c8 : L \u2297Z L \u2192 Z. Let N \u2265 3 be a natural\n19\n\n\fnumber which is prime to p. Let\nb\nK(N ) := {g \u2208 GSp\nGSp(L, \u03c8)(Z)|g\nmod N is identity} and Kp := GSp\nGSp(L, \u03c8)(Zp ).\nWe have an identity Kp = K(N ) \u2229 GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8)(Qp ). Let\nM := proj.lim.N \u2208N,g.c.d.(N,p)=1Ar,1,N ;\nit is a Z(p) -scheme that parametrizes isomorphism classes of principally polarized abelian schemes over Z(p) -schemes that have compatible level-N symplectic\nsimilitude structures for all N \u2208 N prime to p and that have relative dimension\nr.\n(p)\nThe totally discontinuous, locally compact group GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8)(Af ) acts continuously on M and moreover M is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of Ar,1,N,Z(p) for all N \u2208 N\nGSp\nprime to p. From (21) we get that we can identify ShK(N ) (GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) =\nGSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) = MQ . From the last two sentences we get that\nAr,1,N,Q and ShKp (GSp\nGSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) over Z(p) .\nM is a smooth integral model of ShKp (GSp\nLet GZ(p) be the Zariski closure of G in GL L\u2297Z Z(p) ; it is an affine, flat group\nscheme over Z(p) whose generic fibre is G. Let H(N ) := K(N ) \u2229 G(Af ) and\nHp := H(N ) \u2229 G(Qp ). From (21) we easily get that we have finite morphisms\n(22a)\n\nGSp\nf (N ) : ShH(N ) (G, X ) \u2192 ShK(N ) (GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S)\n\nand\n(22b)\n\nGSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S).\nfp : ShHp (G, X ) \u2192 ShKp (GSp\n\nAs N \u2265 3, a principally polarized abelian scheme with level-N structure has\nno automorphism (see [Mu, Ch. IV, 21, Thm. 5] for this result of Serre). This\nGSp\nimplies that K(N ) acts freely on Ar,1,all,E(G,X ) = Sh(GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S)E(G,X ) . From\nthis and (21) we get that H(N ) acts freely on Sh(G, X ). Therefore the E(G, X )scheme ShH(N ) (G, X ) is smooth and thus ShHp (G, X ) is a regular scheme which\nis formally smooth over E(G, X ).\nLet N (N ) be the normalization of Ar,1,N in the ring of fractions of\nShH(N ) (G, X ) and let Np be the normalization of M in the ring of fractions of\nShHp (G, X ). [Comment: the role of the integral model N used in Section 1, will be\nplayed in what follows by N (N ).] Let O(G, X ) be the ring of integers of E(G, X ).\nLet O(G, X )(p) := O(G, X ) \u2297Z Z(p) ; it is the normalization of Z(p) in E(G, X ).\nThe scheme N (N ) is a faithfully flat O(G, X )[ N1 ]-scheme which is normal and\nof finite type and whose generic fibre is ShH(N ) (G, X ) (the finite type part is\nimplied by the fact that O(v) is an excellent ring). The scheme Np is a faithfully\nflat O(G, X )(p) -scheme which is normal and whose generic fibre is ShHp (G, X ).\nOne gets the existence of a finite map\nf (N ) : N (N ) \u2192 Ar,1,N\nand of a pro-finite map\n20\n\n\ffp : Np \u2192 M\nthat extends naturally (22a) and (22b) (respectively). Moreover, the totally dis(p)\ncontinuous, locally compact group G(Af ) acts continuously on Np . Let\nNv := Np \u2297O(G,X )(p) O(v) .\nProposition 3. (a) The O(v) -scheme Nv is a normal integral model of Sh(G, X )\nover O(v) . Moreover, Nv is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of N (N )O(v) .\n(b) The morphism fp : Np \u2192 M is finite.\n(p)\n\nProof: Let H0 be a compact, open subgroup of G(Af ) such that Hp \u00d7 H0 is a\ncompact, open subgroup of H(N ). As H(N ) acts freely on M, it also acts freely\non Np . This implies that Nv is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of both N (N )O(v) and Nv /H0 .\nTherefore for all open subgroups H1 and H2 of H0 with H1 6 H2 , the morphism\nNv /H1 \u2192 Nv /H2 is a finite morphism between \u00e9tale covers of N (N )O(v) and\ntherefore it is an \u00e9tale cover. Based on this, one easily checks that the right action\n(p)\nof G(Af ) on Nv is continuous. Thus (a) holds.\nPart (b) is an easy consequence of the fact that Np /H0 is a finite scheme over\nMO(G,X )(p) /H0 .\n\u0003\n4.2.1. PEL type Shimura varieties\nLet B be the Q\u2013subalgebra of End(W ) formed by elements fixed by G. We consider\ntwo axioms:\n(*) the group G is the identity component of the centralizer of B in GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8);\n(**) the group G is the centralizer of B in GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8).\nIf the axiom (*) holds, then one calls Sh(G, X ) a Shimura variety of PEL type.\nIf the axiom (**) holds, then one calls Sh(G, X ) a Shimura variety of PEL type\nof either A or C type. Here PEL stands for polarizations, endomorphisms, and\nlevel structures while the A and C types refer to the fact that all simple factors\nof Gad\nC are (under the axiom (**)) of some An or Cn Lie type (and not of Dn Lie\ntype with n \u2265 4).\nIf the axiom (**) holds, then we can choose the family (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J to be exactly\nthe family of all elements of B. In such a case, all Hodge cycles mentioned in\nSubsection 3.4.2 are defined by endomorphisms. Let B(p) := B \u2229 End(L\u2297Z Z(p) ); it\nis a Z(p) -order of B.\n4.2.2. Example\nSuppose that B(p) is a semisimple Z(p) -algebra and that GZ(p) is the centralizer\nof B(p) in the group scheme GSp\nGSp(L \u2297Z Z(p) , \u03c8). Then GZ(p) is a reductive group\nscheme and moreover Np (resp. Nv ) is a moduli scheme of principally polarized\nabelian schemes which are over O(G, X )(p) -schemes (resp. over O(v) -schemes),\nwhich have relative dimension r, which have compatible level-N symplectic simil21\n\n\fitude structures for all N \u2208 N prime to p, which are endowed with a Z(p) -algebra\nB(p) of Z(p) -endomorphisms, and which satisfy certain axioms that are related to\nthe properties (d) to (f) of Subsubsection 3.4.2. Unfortunately, presently this is\nthe only case when Np (resp. when Nv ) has a good moduli interpretation. This\nexplains the difficulties one encounters in getting as well as of stating results\npertaining to either Np or Nv .\n4.3. Main problems\nHere is a list of six main problems in the study of N (N ), Np , and Nv . For\nsimplicity, these problems will be stated here only in terms of N (N ).\n(a) Determine when N (N ) is uniquely determined up to isomorphism by its\ngeneric fibre ShH(N ) (G, X ) and by a suitable universal property.\n(b) Determine when N (N ) is a smooth O(G, X )[ N1 ]-scheme.\n(c) Determine when N (N ) is a projective O(G, X )[ N1 ]-scheme.\n(d) Identify and study different stratifications of the special fibres of N (N ).\n(e) Describe the points of N (N ) with values in finite fields.\n(f ) Describe the points of N (N ) with values in O[ N1 ], where O is the ring of\nintegers of some finite field extension of E(G, X ).\nIn the next four Sections we will study the first four problems one by one, in\na way that could be useful towards the partial solutions of the problem (e). Any\napproach to the problem (f) would require a very good understanding of the first\nfive problems and this is the reason (as well as the main motivation) for why the\nsix problems are listed together.\n\n5. Uniqueness of integral models\nUntil the end we will use the following notations introduced in Section 4:\nGSp\nf : (G, X ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S), L, N, K(N ), Kp , H(N ), Hp , O(G, X ),\n\nO(G, X )(p) , v, O(v) , f (N ) : N (N ) \u2192 Ar,1,N , fp : Np \u2192 M, Nv , GZ(p) .\nLet ev be the index of ramification of v. Let k(v) be the residue field of v. Let\nL(N )v := N (N ) \u2297O(G,X )[ N1 ] k(v) and Lv := Nv \u2297O(v) k(v).\nIn this Section we study when the k(v)-scheme L(N )v (resp. Lv ) is uniquely\ndetermined in some sensible way by ShH(N ) (G, X ) (resp. by ShHp (G, X )) and\nby the prime v of E(G, X ). Whenever one gets such a uniqueness property, one\n22\n\n\fcan call L(N )v (resp. Lv ) as the canonical fibre model of ShH(N ) (G, X ) (resp.\nShHp (G, X )) at v (or over k(v)).\nMilne's original insight (see [Mi2] and [Va1]) was to prove in many cases the\nuniqueness of Nv and Lv by showing first that:\n(i) the O(v) -scheme Nv has the extension property, and\n(ii) Nv is a healthy regular scheme in the sense of Definition 4.1 (b).\nWhile (i) always holds (see Proposition 4 below), it is very hard in general\nto decide if (ii) holds. However, results of [Va1], [Va2], and [Va11] allow us to\nget that (ii) holds in many cases of interest (see Subsection 5.1). Subsection 5.2\nshows how one gets the uniqueness of N (N ) (and therefore also of L(N )v ) via\n(the uniqueness of) N\u00e9ron models.\nProposition 4. The O(v) -scheme Nv has the extension property.\nProof: Let Y be a healthy regular scheme over O(v) . Let q : YE(G,X ) \u2192 ShHp (G, X )\nbe a morphism of E(G, X )-schemes. Let (U, \u03bbU ) be the pull back to YE(G,X ) of the\nuniversal principally polarized abelian scheme over M (via the composite morGSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) = MQ ). As the universal\nphism YE(G,X ) \u2192 ShHp (G, X ) \u2192 ShKp (GSp\nprincipally polarized abelian scheme over M has a level-N symplectic similitude\nstructure for all N \u2208 N prime to p, the same holds for (U, \u03bbU ). From this and the\nN\u00e9ron\u2013Ogg\u2013Shafarevich criterion of good reduction (see [BLR, Ch. 7, 7.4, Thm.\n5]) we get that U extends to an abelian scheme UU over an open subscheme U of\nY which contains YQ = YE(G,X ) and for which we have codimY (Y \\ U ) \u2265 2. Thus\nUU extends to an abelian scheme UY over Y , cf. the very definition of a healthy\nregular scheme. The polarization \u03bbU extends as well to a polarization \u03bbUY of UY ,\ncf. [Mi2, Prop. 2.14]. Moreover, each level-N symplectic similitude structure of\n(U, \u03bbU ) extends to a level-N symplectic similitude structure of (UY , \u03bbUY ). This\nimplies that the composite of q with the finite morphism ShHp (G, X ) \u2192 ME(G,X )\nextends uniquely to a morphism Y \u2192 MO(v) . As Y is a regular scheme and thus\nalso normal and as Nv \u2192 MO(v) is a finite morphism, we get that the morphism\nY \u2192 MO(v) factors uniquely through Nv (as it does so generically). This implies\nthat q : YE(G,X ) \u2192 ShHp (G, X ) extends uniquely to a morphism qY : Y \u2192 Nv of\nO(v) -schemes. From this the Proposition follows.\n\u0003\nProposition 5. Let Y be a regular scheme which is faithfully flat over Z(p) . Then\nthe following two properties hold:\n(a) Let U be an open subscheme of Y which contains YQ and the generic\npoints of YFp . Let AU be an abelian scheme over U with the property that its pdivisible group DU extends to a p-divisible group D over Y . Then AU extends to\nan abelian scheme A over U .\n(b) If Y is a p-healthy regular scheme, then it is also a healthy regular scheme.\nProof: Part (b) follows from (a) and the very definitions. To prove (a) we follow\n[Va2, Prop. 4.1]. Let N \u2265 3 be a positive integer relatively prime to p.\n23\n\n\fTo show that A exists, we can assume that Y is local, complete, and strictly\nhenselian, that U is the complement of the maximal point y of Y , that AU has\na principal polarization \u03bbAU , and that (AU , \u03bbAU ) has a level-N symplectic similitude structure lU,N (see [FC, (i)-(iii) of pp. 185, 186]). We write Y = Spec(R).\nLet \u03bbDU be the principal quasi-polarization of DU defined naturally by \u03bbAU ; it\nextends to a principal quasi-polarization \u03bbD of D (cf. Tate's theorem [Ta, Thm.\n4]). Let r be the relative dimension of AU . Let (A, \u039bA ) be the universal principally\npolarized abelian scheme over Ar,1,N .\nLet mU : U \u2192 Ar,1,N be the morphism defined by (AU , \u03bbAU , lU,N ). We show\nthat mU extends to a morphism m : Y \u2192 Ar,1,N .\nLet N0 \u2208 N be prime to p. From the classical purity theorem we get that the\n\u00e9tale cover AU [N0 ] \u2192 U extends to an \u00e9tale cover YN0 \u2192 Y . But as Y is strictly\nhenselian, Y has no connected \u00e9tale cover different from Y . Thus each YN0 is a\ndisjoint union of N02r -copies of Y . From this we get that (AU , \u03bbAU ) has a level-N0\nsymplectic similitude structure lU,N0 for every N0 \u2208 N prime to p.\nLet Ar,1,N be a projective, toroidal compactification of Ar,1,N such that (cf.\n[FC, Chap. IV, Thm. 6.7]):\n(a) the complement of Ar,1,N in Ar,1,N has pure codimension 1 in Ar,1,N and\n(b) there exists a semi-abelian scheme over Ar,1,N that extends A.\nLet \u1ef8 be the normalization of the Zariski closure of U in Y \u00d7Z Ar,1,N . It\nis a projective, normal, integral Y -scheme which has U as an open subscheme.\nLet C be the complement of U in \u1ef8 endowed with the reduced structure; it is a\nreduced, projective scheme over the residue field k of y. The Z-algebras of global\nfunctions of Y , U , and \u1ef8 are all equal to R (cf. [Ma, Thm. 38] for U ). Thus C is\na connected k-scheme, cf. [Ha, Ch. III, Cor. 11.3] applied to \u1ef8 \u2192 Y .\nLet A\u1ef8 be the semi-abelian scheme over \u1ef8 that extends AU (it is unique, cf.\n[FC, Chap. I, Prop. 2.7]). Due to the existence of the lU,N0 's, the N\u00e9ron\u2013Ogg\u2013\nShafarevich criterion implies that A\u1ef8 is an abelian scheme in codimension at\nmost 1. Therefore, since the complement of Ar,1,N in Ar,1,N has pure codimension\n1 in Ar,1,N , it follows that A\u1ef8 is an abelian scheme. Thus mU extends to a\nmorphism m\u1ef8 : \u1ef8 \u2192 Ar,1,N . Let \u03bbA := m\u2217\u1ef8 (\u039bA ). Tate's theorem implies that\n\u1ef8\n\nthe principally quasi-polarized p-divisible group of (A\u1ef8 , \u03bbA ) is the pull-back\n\u1ef8\n\n(D\u1ef8 , \u03bbD\u1ef8 ) of (D, \u03bbD ) to \u1ef8 . Hence the pull back (DC , \u03bbDC ) of (D\u1ef8 , \u03bbD\u1ef8 ) to C is\nconstant i.e., it is the pull back to C of a principally quasi-polarized p-divisible\ngroup over k.\nWe check that the image m\u1ef8 (C) of C through m\u1ef8 is a point {y0 } of Ar,1,N .\ncc is the compleSince C is connected, to check this it suffices to show that, if O\ntion of the local ring Oc of C at an arbitrary point c of C, then the morphism\ncc ) \u2192 Ar,1,N defined naturally by m is constant. But as (DC , \u03bbDC ) is\nSpec(O\n\u1ef8\nconstant, this follows from Serre\u2013Tate deformation theory (see [Me, Chaps. 4, 5]).\nThus m\u1ef8 (C) is a point {y0 } of Ar,1,N .\nLet R0 be the local ring of Ar,1,N at y0 . Because Y is local and \u1ef8 is a projective Y -scheme, each point of \u1ef8 specializes to a point of C. Hence each point of\nthe image of m\u1ef8 specializes to y0 and thus m\u1ef8 factors through the natural mor24\n\n\fphism Spec(R0 ) \u2192 Ar,1,N . Since R is the ring of global functions of \u1ef8 , the resulting morphism \u1ef8 \u2192 Spec(R0 ) factors through a morphism Spec(R) \u2192 Spec(R0 ).\nTherefore m\u1ef8 factors through a morphism m : Y \u2192 Ar,1,N that extends mU .\nThis ends the argument for the existence of m. We conclude that A := m\u2217 (A) is\nan abelian scheme over Y which extends AU . Thus (a) holds.\n\u0003\n5.1. Examples of healthy regular schemes\nIn (the proofs of) [FC, Ch. IV, Thms. 6.4, 6.4', and 6.8] was claimed that every\nregular scheme which is faithfully flat over Z(p) is p-healthy regular as well as\nhealthy regular. In turns out that this claim is far from being true. For instance,\nan example of Raynaud\u2013Gabber\u2013Ogus (see [dJO1, Sect. 6]) shows that the regular\nscheme Spec(W (k)[[x, y]]/((xy)p\u22121 \u2212 p)) is neither p-healthy nor healthy regular.\nHere W (k) is the ring of Witt vectors with coefficients in a perfect field k of\ncharacteristic p.\nBased on Proposition 5 (b) and a theorem of Raynaud (see [Ra, Thm. 3.3.3]),\none easily checks that if ev < p \u2212 2, then each regular scheme which is formally\nsmooth over O(v) is a healthy regular scheme (see [Va1, Subsubsect. 3.2.17]). In\n[Va2, Thm. 1.3] it is proved that the same holds provided ev = 1. In [Va11] it is\nproved that the same holds provided ev = p \u2212 1. Even more, in [Va11, Thm. 1.3\nand Cor. 1.5] it is proved that:\nTheorem 1. (a) Suppose that p > 2. Each regular scheme which is formally smooth\nover O(v) is healthy regular if and only if the following inequality holds ev \u2264 p \u2212 1.\n(b) Suppose that p = 2 and ev = 1. Then each regular scheme which is\nformally smooth over O(v) is healthy regular.\nPart (a) also holds for p = 2 but this is not checked loc. cit. and this is why\nabove for p = 2 we stated only one implication in the form of (b). From Theorem\n1 and Propositions 3 (a) and 4 we get the following answer to the problem 4.3\n(a):\nCorollary 1. Suppose that ev \u2264 p \u2212 1 and that Nv is a regular scheme which is\nformally smooth over O(v) (i.e., and that N (N )O(v) is a smooth O(v) -scheme).\nThen Nv is the integral canonical model of ShHp (G, X ) over O(v) and it is uniquely\ndetermined up to unique isomorphism. Thus also L(N )v and Lv are uniquely\ndetermined by ShH(N ) (G, X ) and ShHp (G, X ) (respectively) and v.\n5.1.1. Example\nGSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) over Z(p) is M.\nThe integral canonical model of ShKp (GSp\n5.2. Integral models as N\u00e8ron models\nIn [Ne] it is showed that each abelian variety over the field of fractions K of a\nDedekind domain D has a N\u00e9ron model over D. In [BLR] it is checked that many\nother closed subschemes of torsors of certain commutative group varieties over\nK, have N\u00e9ron models over D. But most often, for N >> 0 the E(G, X )-scheme\nShH(N ) (G, X ) can not be embedded in such torsors; we include one basic example.\n25\n\n\f5.2.1. Example\nSuppose that Gad\nSU(a, b)ad\nSU(a + b, 0)ad\nR is isomorphic to SU\nR \u00d7R SU\nR for some pos1,0\nitive integers a \u2265 3 and b \u2265 3. One has H (C(C), C) = 0 for each connected component C of ShH(N ) (G, X )C , cf. [Pa, Thm. 2, 2.8 (i)]. The analytic\nLie group Alb(C)an associated to the albanese variety Alb(C) is isomorphic to\n[Hom(H 1,0 (C(C), C), C)]/H1 (C, Z) and therefore it is 0. The Q\u2013rank of Gad is 0\nand this implies that ShH(N ) (G, X ) is a projective E(G, X )-scheme, cf. [BHC,\nThm. 12.3 and Cor. 12.4]. From the last two sentences one gets that C is a connected, projective variety over C whose albanese variety Alb(C) is trivial. Thus C\ncan not be embedded into commutative group varieties over C. Therefore the connected components of the E(G, X )-scheme ShH(N ) (G, X ) can not be embedded\ninto torsors of commutative group varieties over E(G, X ).\nBased on the previous example we get that the class of N\u00e9ron models introduced below is new (cf. [Va4, Prop. 4.4.1] and [Va11, Thm. 4.3.1]).\nTheorem 2. Suppose that for each prime p that does not divide N and for every\nprime v of E(G, X ) that divides p, we have ev \u2264 p \u2212 1. Suppose that N (N ) is\na smooth, projective O(G, X )[ N1 ]-scheme. Then N (N ) is the N\u00e9ron model of its\ngeneric fibre ShH(N ) (G, X ) over O(G, X )[ N1 ] (and thus it is uniquely determined\nby ShH(N ) (G, X ) and N ).\nTheorem 2 provides a better answer to problem 4.3 (a) than Corollary 1,\nprovided in addition we know that N (N ) is a projective O(G, X )[ N1 ]-scheme.\n\n6. Smoothness of integral models\nWe will use the notations listed at the beginning of Section 5. In this Section we\nstudy the smoothness of Nv and N (N )v . Let (G1 , X1 ) be a Shimura pair such that\nthe group G1,Qp is unramified. Let H1 be a hyperspecial subgroup of G1 (Qp ) =\nG1,Qp (Qp ), cf. Definition 4.1 (f). In 1976 Langlands conjectured the existence of a\ngood integral model of ShH1 (G1 , X1 ) over each local ring O(v1 ) of E(G1 , X1 ) at a\nprime v1 of E(G1 , X1 ) that divides p (see [La, p. 411]); unfortunately, Langlands\ndid not explain what good is supposed to stand for. We emphasize that the\nassumption that G1,Qp is unramified implies that E(G1 , X1 ) is unramified above\np (see [Mi3, Cor. 4.7 (a)]); thus the index of ramification ev1 of v1 is 1.\nIn 1992 Milne made the following conjecture (slight reformulation made by\nus, as in [Va1, Conj. 3.2.5]; strictly speaking, both Langlands and Milne stated\ntheir conjectures over the completion of O(v1 ) ).\nConjecture 1. There exists an integral canonical model of ShH1 (G1 , X1 ) over\nO(v1 ) .\nFrom the classical works of Zink, Rapoport\u2013Langlands, and Kottwitz one gets\n(see [Zi1], [LR], and [Ko2]):\n26\n\n\fTheorem 3. (a) The Milne conjecture holds if p \u2265 3 and Sh(G1 , X1 ) is a Shimura\nvariety of PEL type.\n(b) The Milne conjecture holds if Sh(G1 , X1 ) is a Shimura variety of PEL\ntype of either A or C type.\nThe main results of [Va1] and [Va6] say (see [Va1, 1.4, Thm. 2, and Thm.\n6.4.1] and [Va6, Thm. 1.3]):\nTheorem 4. Suppose one of the following two conditions holds:\n(a) p \u2265 5 and ShH1 (G1 , X1 ) is of abelian type;\n(b) p is arbitrary and ShH1 (G1 , X1 ) is a unitary Shimura variety.\nThen the Milne conjecture holds. Moreover, for each prime v1 of E(G1 , X1 )\nthat divides p, the integral canonical model of ShH1 (G1 , X1 ) over O(v1 ) is a pro\u00e9tale cover of a smooth, quasi-projective O(v1 ) -scheme.\nRemark 2. See [Va2, Thm. 1.3] and [Va6, Thm. 1.3] for two corrections to the\nproof of Theorem 4 under the assumption that condition (a) holds. More precisely:\n\u2022 the original argument of Faltings for the proof of Proposition 5 was incorrect\nand it has been corrected in [Va2] (cf. proof of Proposition 5);\n\u2022 the proof of Theorem 4 for the cases when Gad\n1,C has simple factors isomorphic to PGL pm for some m \u2208 N was partially incorrect and it has been corrected\nby [Va6, Thm. 1.3] (cf. [Va6, Appendix, E.3]).\n6.1. Strategy of the proof of Theorem 4, part a\nTo explain the four main steps of the proof of the (a) part of Theorem 4, we will\nsketch the argument why the assumptions that p > 3 and that GZ(p) is a reductive\ngroup scheme over Z(p) imply that Np is a formally smooth scheme over Z(p) . Let\nW (F) be the ring of Witt vectors with coefficients in an algebraic closure F of Fp .\nLet B(F) := W (F)[ p1 ].\nLet y : Spec(F) \u2192 Np and let z : Spec(V ) \u2192 Np be a lift of y, where V is\na finite, discrete valuation ring extension of W (F). Let e be the index of ramification of V . Let Re been the p-adic completion of the W (F)[[x]]-subalgebra of\nB(F)[[x]] generated by xn! with n \u2208 N. Let \u03a6e be the Frobenius endomorphism\nof Re which is compatible with the Frobenius automorphism of W (F) and which\ntakes x to xp . We have a natural W (F)-epimorphism m\u03c0 : Re \u0589 V which maps\nx to a fixed uniformizer \u03c0 of V . The kernel J\u03c0 of m\u03c0 has divided power structures and thus we can speak about the evaluation of F -crystals at the thickening\nSpec(V ) \u0592\u2192 Spec(Re ) defined naturally by m\u03c0 . We now consider the principally\nquasi-polarized, filtered F -crystal of the pull back (AV , \u03bbAV ) to Spec(V ) of the\nuniversal principally abelian scheme over M (via fp \u25e6 z). Its evaluation at the\nthickening Spec(V ) \u0592\u2192 Spec(Re ) is of the form\n(MRe , FV1 , \u03c6MRe , \u2207MRe , \u03c8MRe ),\n27\n\n\fwhere MRe is a free Re -module of rank 2r, FV1 is a direct summand of\n1\nHdR\n(AV /V ) = MRe /J\u03c0 MRe of rank r, \u03c6MRe is a \u03a6e -linear endomorphism of MRe ,\n\u2207MRe is an integrable, nilpotent modulo p connection on MRe , and \u03c8MRe is a\nperfect alternating form on MRe . The generic fibre of AV is equipped with a family of Hodge cycles whose de Rham realizations belong to T (MRe [ p1 ]/J\u03c0 MRe [ p1 ])\nand lift naturally to define a family of tensors (tz,\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J of T (MRe [ p1 ]).\nThe first main step is to show that, under some conditions on the closed\nGSp(L \u2297Z Z(p) , \u03c8) and under the assumpembedding homomorphism GZ(p) \u0592\u2192 GSp\ntion that p > 3, the Zariski closure in GSp\nGSp(MRe , \u03c8MRe ) of the subgroup of\nGSp\nGSp(MRe [ p1 ], \u03c8MRe ) that fixes tz,\u03b1 for all \u03b1 \u2208 J , is a reductive group scheme G\u0303Re\nover Re . See [Va1, Subsect. 5.2] for more details and see [Va1, (5.2.12)] for the\nfact that the reductive group scheme G\u0303Re is isomorphic to GZ(P ) \u00d7Z(p) Re .\nThe second main step is to show that we can lift FV1 to a direct summand FR1 e\nof MRe in such a way that \u03c8MRe (FR1 e \u2297 FR1 e ) = 0 and that for each element \u03b1 \u2208 J\nthe tensor tz,\u03b1 belongs to the F 0 -filtration of T (MRe [ p1 ]) defined by FR1 e [ p1 ]. The\nessence of this second main step is the classical theory of infinitesimal liftings of\ncocharacters of smooth group schemes (see [DG, Exp. IX]). Due to the existence\nof FR1 e , the morphism z : Spec(V ) \u2192 Np lifts to a morphism w : Spec(Re ) \u2192\nNp . The reduction of w modulo the ideal Re \u2229 xB(F)[[x]] of Re is a lift z0 :\nSpec(W (F)) \u2192 Np of y. Thus, by replacing z with z0 we can assume that V =\nW (F). See [Va1, Subsect. 5.3] for more details.\nThe third main step uses the lift z0 : Spec(W (F)) \u2192 Np of y and Faltings\ndeformation theory (see [Fa, Sect. 7]) to show that Np is formally smooth over\nZ(p) at its F-valued point defined by y. See [Va1, Subsect. 5.4] for more details.\nThe fourth main step shows that for p > 3 the mentioned conditions on\nGSp(L \u2297Z Z(p) , \u03c8) always hold,\nthe closed embedding homomorphism GZ(p) \u0592\u2192 GSp\nGSp\nprovided we replace f : (G, X ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) by a suitable other injective\nGSp\nmap f1 : (G1 , X1 ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp\nGSp(W1 , \u03c81 ), S1 ) with the property that (Gad , X ad ) =\nad\nad\n(G1 , X1 ). See [Va1, Subsects. 6.5 and 6.6] for more details.\nRemark 3. In [Va7] it is shown that Theorem 4 holds even if p \u2208 {2, 3} and\nSh(G1 , X1 ) is of abelian type. In [Ki] it is claimed that Theorem 4 holds for p \u2265 3.\nThe work [Ki] does not bring any new conceptual ideas to [Va1], [Va6], and [Va7].\nIn fact, the note [Ki] is only a variation of [Va1], [Va6], and [Va7]. This variation\nis made possible due to recent advances in the theory of crystalline representations\nachieved by Fontaine, Breuil, and Kisin. We emphasize that [Ki] does not work\nfor p = 2 while [Va7] works as well for p = 2.\n6.2. Strategy of the proof of Theorem 4, part b\nTo explain the three main steps of the proof of the (b) part of Theorem 4, in this\nSubsection we will assume that (G1 , X1 ) is a simple, adjoint, unitary Shimura\npair of isotypic An Dynkin type. In [De2, Prop. 2.3.10] it is proved the existence\nGSp\nof an injective map f : (G, X ) \u0592\u2192 (GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S) of Shimura pairs such that we\nhave (Gad , X ad ) = (G1 , X1 ).\n28\n\n\fThe first step uses a modification of the proof of [De2, Prop. 2.3.10] to show\nGSp(L \u2297Z Z(p) , \u03c8) that\nthat we can choose f such that GZ(p) is the subgroup of GSp\nfixes a semisimple Z(p) \u2013subalgebra B(p) of End(W ) (see [Va6, Prop. 3.2]). Let\nad\nH1,p := Gad\nZ(p) (Zp ); it is a hypersecial subgroup of G1,Qp (Qp ) = GQp (Qp ).\nThe second step only applies Theorem 3 to conclude that Np is a formally\nsmooth O(G, X )(p) -scheme.\nThe third step uses the standard moduli interpretation of Np to show that the\nanalogue N1,p of Np but for (G1 , X1 , H1,p ) instead of for (G, X , Hp ) exists as well\n(see [Va6, Thm. 4.3 and Cor. 4.4]). If we fix a Z(p) -monomorphism O(G, X )(p) \u0592\u2192\nW (F), then every connected component C1 of N1,W (F) will be isomorphic to the\nquotient of a connected component C of NW (F) by a suitable group action T whose\ngeneric fibre is free and which involves a torsion group. The key point is to show\nthat the action T itself is free (i.e., C1 is a formally smooth W (F)-scheme). If\np > 2 and p does not divide n + 1, then the torsion group of the action T has no\nelements of order p and thus the action T is free (cf. proof of [Va1, Thm. 6.2.2\nb)]). In [Va6] it is checked that the action T is always free i.e., it is free even for\nthe harder cases when either p = 2 or p divides n + 1. The proof relies on the\nmoduli interpretation of Np which makes this group action quite explicit. The\ncases p = 2 and p divides n + 1 are the hardest due to the following two reasons.\n(i) If p = 2 and if A is an abelian variety over F whose 2-rank a is positive,\n2\nthen the group (Z/2Z)a is naturally a subgroup of the group of automorphisms\nof the formal deformation space Def(A) of A in such a way that the filtered\nDieudonn\u00e9 module of a lift \u22c6 of A to Spf(W (F)) depends only on the orbit under\nthis action of the Spf(W (F))-valued point of Def(A) defined by \u22c6.\n(ii) For a positive integer m divisible by p \u2212 1 there exist actions of Z/pZ on\nZp [[x1 , . . . , xm ]] such that the induced actions on Zp [[x1 , . . . , xm ]][ p1 ] are free.\nTheorem 5. We assume that either 6 divides N or Sh(G, X ) is a unitary Shimura\nvariety. We also assume that the Zariski closure of G in GL L\u2297Z Z[ N1 ] is a reductive\ngroup scheme over Z[ N1 ]. Then N (N ) is a smooth scheme over either O(G, X )[ N1 ]\nor Z[ N1 ].\nProof: Let p be an arbitrary prime that does not divide N and let v be a prime\nof E(G, X ) that divides p. The group scheme GZ(p) is reductive. Thus the group\nGQp is unramified. This implies that E(G, X ) is unramified over p and that Hp\nis a hyperspecial subgroup of GQp (Qp ). Therefore O(G, X )[ N1 ] is an \u00e9tale Z[ N1 ]algebra. From this and Proposition 3 (a) we get that to prove the Theorem it\nsuffices to show that each scheme Nv is regular and formally smooth over O(v) .\nLet Iv be the integral canonical model of ShHp (G, X ) over O(v) , cf. Theorem\n4. As Iv is a healthy regular scheme (cf. Theorem 1), from Proposition 4 we get\nthat we have an O(v) -morphism a : Iv \u2192 Nv whose generic fibre is the identity\nautomorphism of ShHp (G, X ). The morphism a is a pro-\u00e9tale cover of a morphism\naH0 : Iv /H0 \u2192 Nv /H0 of normal O(v) -schemes of finite type, where H0 is a\n(p)\n\nsmall enough compact, open subgroup of G(Af ). From Theorem 4 we get that\nIv /H0 is a quasi-projective O(v) -scheme. Thus aH0 is a quasi-projective morphism\n29\n\n\fbetween flat O(v) -schemes. As each discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic\n(0, p) is a healthy regular scheme, the morphism a satisfies the valuative criterion\nof properness with respect to such discrete valuation rings. From the last two\nsentences we get that aH0 is in fact a projective morphism.\nWe consider an open subscheme Vv of Nv which contains ShHp (G, X ) and for\nwhich the morphism a\u22121 (Vv ) \u2192 Vv is an isomorphism. As Iv has the extension\nproperty (cf. Definition 4.1 (d)), from Theorem 4 we easily get that we can assume\nthat Vv contains the formally smooth locus of Nv over O(v) . As aH0 is projective,\nfrom Proposition 3 (a) we get that we can also assume that we have an inequality\ncodimNv (Nv \\ Vv ) \u2265 2. Obviously we can assume that Vv is H0 -invariant. Thus\nthe projective morphism aH0 : Iv /H0 \u2192 Nv /H0 is an isomorphism above Vv /H0 .\nTo check that Nv is a regular scheme which is formally smooth over O(v) it\nsuffices to show that aH0 is an isomorphism. To check that aH0 is an isomorphism,\nit suffices to show that a\u22121\nH0 (Vv /H0 ) contains all points of Iv /H0 of codimension 1\n(this is so as the projective morphism aH0 is a blowing up of a closed subscheme\nof Nv /H0 ; the proof of this is similar to [Ha, Ch. II, Thm. 7.17]). Let Y be the\nset of points of Iv /H0 which are of codimension 1 and which do not belong to\na\u22121\n \u0303 v /H0 . We show that the assumption that the set Y is non-empty\nH0 (Vv /H0 )\u2192V\nleads to a contradiction.\nLet C be the open subscheme of Iv /H0 that contains: (i) the generic fibre of\nIv /H0 and (ii) the union E of those connected components of the special fibre\nof Iv /H0 whose generic points are in Y. The image E0 := aH0 (E) has dimension\nless than E and is contained in the non-smooth locus of Nv /H0 . The morphism\nC \u2192 Nv /H0 factors through the dilatation D of Nv /H0 centered on the reduced\nscheme of the non-smooth locus of Nv /H0 , cf. the universal property of dilatations\n(see Definition 4.1 (g) or [BLR, Ch. 3, 3.2, Prop. 3.1 (b)]). But D is an affine\nNv /H0 -scheme and thus the image of the projective Nv /H0 -scheme E in D has\nthe same dimension as E0 . By repeating the process we get that the image of E in a\nsmoothening D\u221e of Nv /H0 obtaining via a sequence of blows up centered on nonsmooth loci (see [BLR, Ch. 3, Thm. 3 of 3.1 and Thm. 2 of 3.4]), has dimension\ndim(E0 ) and thus it has dimension less than E. But each discrete valuation ring\nof D\u221e dominates a local ring of Iv /H0 (as aH0 is a projective morphism) and\ntherefore it is also a local ring of Iv /H0 . As D\u221e has at least one discrete valuation\nring which is not a local ring of Vv /H0 , we get that this discrete valuation ring\nis the local ring of some point in Y. Thus the image of E in D\u221e has the same\ndimension as E. Contradiction.\n\u0003\n\n7. Projectiveness of integral models\nThe C-scheme ShH(N ) (G, X )C is projective if and only if the Q\u2013rank of Gad is 0,\ncf. [BHC, Thm. 12.3 and Cor. 12.4]. Based on this Morita conjectured in 1975\nthat (see [Mo]):\nConjecture 2. Suppose that the Q\u2013rank of Gad is 0. Then for each N \u2208 N with\nN \u2265 3, the O(G, X )[ N1 ]-scheme N (N ) is projective.\n30\n\n\fConjecture 3. Let AE be an abelian variety over a number field E. Let HA be the\nad\nMumford\u2013Tate group of some extension A of AE to C. If the Q\u2013rank of HA\nis 0,\nthen AE has potentially good reduction everywhere (i.e., there exists a finite field\nextension E1 of E such that AE1 extends to an abelian scheme over the ring of\nintegers of E1 ).\n7.1. On the equivalence of Conjectures 2 and 3\nIn [Mo] it is shown that Conjectures 2 and 3 are equivalent. We recall the argument\nfor this. Suppose that Conjecture 2 holds. To check that Conjecture 3 holds, we\ncan replace E by a finite field extension of it and we can replace AE by an abelian\nvariety over E which is isogeneous to it. Based on this and [Mu, Ch. IV, \u00a723,\nCor. 1], we can assume that AE has a principal polarization \u03bbAE . By enlarging\nE, we can also assume that all Hodge cycles on A are pull backs of Hodge cycles\non AE (cf. [De3, Prop. 2.9 and Thm. 2.11]) and that (AE , \u03bbAE ) has a level-l1 l2\nsymplectic similitude structure. Here l1 and l2 are two distinct odd primes. By\ntaking G = HA and xA to belong to XA , we can assume that (AE , \u03bbAE ) is the pulls\nback of the universal principally polarized abelian schemes over N (l1 ) and N (l2 ).\nAs N (l1 ) and N (l2 ) are projective schemes over O(G, X )[ l11 ] and O(G, X )[ l12 ]\n(respectively), we get that (AE , \u03bbAE ) extends to a principally polarized abelian\nscheme over the ring of integers of E. Thus Conjecture 2 implies Conjecture 3.\nThe arguments of the previous paragraph can be reversed to show that Conjecture 3 implies Conjecture 2.\nDef inition 5. We say AE (resp. (G, X )) has compact factors, if for each simple\nad\nfactor \u2020 of HA\n(resp. of Gad ) there exists a simple factor of \u2020R which is compact.\nIn [Va4, Thm. 1.2 and Cor. 4.3] it is proved that:\nTheorem 6. Suppose that (G, X ) (resp. AE ) has compact factors. Then Conjecture\n2 (resp. 3) holds.\n7.2. Different approaches\nLet LA := H1 (Aan , Z) and WA := LA \u2297Z Q. We present different approaches to\nprove Conjectures 2 and 3 developed by Grothendieck, Morita, Paugam, and us.\n(a) Suppose that there exists a prime p such that the group HQadp is anisotropic\n(i.e., its Qp -rank is 0). Then Conjectures 2 and 3 are true (see [Mo] for the\npotentially good reduction outside of those primes dividing p; see [Pau] for the\npotentially good reduction even at the primes dividing p).\n(b) Let B be as in Subsubsection 4.2.1 (resp. be the centralizer of HA in\nEnd(WA )). We assume that the centralizer of B in End(W ) (resp. in End(WA ))\nis a central division algebra over Q. Then Conjecture 2 (resp. 3) holds (see [Mo]).\n(c) By replacing E with a finite field extension of it, we can assume that\nAE has everywhere semi-abelian reduction. Let l \u2208 N be a prime different from\np. Let Tl (AE ) be the l-adic Tate\u2013module of AE . As Zl -modules we can identify\n31\n\n\fTl (AE ) = H1 (Aan , Z)\u2297Z Zl = LA \u2297Z Zl . By replacing E with a finite field extension\nof it, we can assume that for each prime l \u2208 N the l-adic representation \u03c1l :\nGal(E) \u2192 GL Tl (AE ) (Ql ) factors through HA (Ql ). Let w be a prime of E that\ndivides p. If AE does not have good reduction at w, then there exists a Zl submodule T of Tl (AE ) such that the inertia group of w acts trivially on T and\nTl (AE )/T and non-trivially on Tl (AE ) (see [SGA7, Vol. I, Exp. IX, Thm. 3.5]).\nThis implies that HA (Ql ) has unipotent elements of unipotent class 2.\nIn [Pau] is is shown that if HA (Ql ) has no unipotent element of unipotent\nclass 2, then Conjecture 3 holds for A. Using this, Conjectures 2 and 3 are proved\nin [Pau] in many cases. These cases are particular cases of either Theorem 6 or\n(a).\n(d) We explain the approach used in [Va4] to prove Theorem 6. Let BE be\nanother abelian variety over E. We say that AE and BE are adjoint-isogeneous,\nif the adjoint groups of the Mumford\u2013Tate groups HA , HB , and HA\u00d7C B are\nisomorphic (more precisely, the standard monomorphism HA\u00d7C B \u0592\u2192 HA \u00d7Q HB\nad\nad\nad\nad\ninduces naturally isomorphisms HA\u00d7\n\u2192H\n \u0303 A\nand HA\u00d7\n\u2192H\n \u0303 B\n).\nCB\nCB\nTo prove Conjecture 3 for AE it is the same thing as to prove Conjecture 3\nfor BE . Based on this, to prove Conjecture 3, one can replace the monomorphism\nHA \u0592\u2192 GL WA by another one HB \u0592\u2192 GL WB which is simpler. Based on this and\nSubsection 7.1, to prove Conjectures 2 and 3 it suffices to prove Conjecture 2 in\nthe cases when:\n(i) the adjoint group Gad is a simple Q\u2013group;\n(ii) if F is a totally real number field such that Gad = ResF/Q Gad,F , with\nGad,F an absolutely simple adjoint group over F , then F is naturally a Q\u2013\nsubalgebra of the semisimple Q\u2013algebra B we introduced in Subsubsection 4.2.1;\n(iii) the monomorphism G \u0592\u2192 GL W is simple enough.\nSuppose that (G, X ) has compact factors. By considering a large field that\ncontains both R and Qp , one obtains naturally an identification Hom(F, R) =\nHom(F, Qp ). Thus we can speak about the p-adic field Fj0 which is the factor of\n(23a)\n\nF \u2297Q Qp =\n\nY\n\nFj\n\nj\u2208J\n\nthat corresponds\n(via the mentioned identification) to a simple, compact factor of\nQ\nad,F\n\u00d7F,i R. The existence of such a simple, compact factor\nGad\n=\nR\ni\u2208Hom(F,R) G\nis guaranteed by Definition 5.\nTo prove Theorem 6, it suffices to show that each morphism c : Spec(k((x))) \u2192\nN (N ), with k an algebraically closed field of prime characteristic p that does not\ndivide N , extends to a morphism Spec(k[[x]]) \u2192 N (N ).\nWe outline the argument for why the assumption that there exists such a\nmorphism c : Spec(k((x))) \u2192 N (N ) which does not extend, leads to a contradiction. The morphism c gives birth naturally to an abelian variety E of dimension r\nover k((x)). We can assume that E extends to a semi-abelian scheme Ek[[x]] over\nk[[x]] whose special fibre Ek is not an abelian variety. Let Tk be the maximal torus\n32\n\n\fof Ck . The field F acts naturally on X \u2217 (Tk ) \u2297Z Q, where X \u2217 (Tk ) is the abelian\ngroup of characters of Tk . Let k1 be an algebraic closure of k((x)). Let (M, \u03c6)\nbe the contravariant Dieudonn\u00e9 module of Ek1 . Due to (ii), one has a natural\ndecomposition of F \u2297Q Qp -modules\n1\n(M [ ], \u03c6) = \u2295j\u2208J (Mj , \u03c6).\np\n\n(23b)\n\nFor each m \u2208 N, the composite monomorphism Tk [pm ] \u0592\u2192 Ek [pm ] \u0592\u2192 Ek lifts\nuniquely to a homomorphism (Tk [pm ])k[[x]] \u2192 Ek[[x]] (see [DG, Exp. IX, Thms.\n3.6 and 7.1]) which due to Nakayama's lemma is a closed embedding. This implies\nthat we have a monomorphism (Tk [pm ])k((x)) \u0592\u2192 E[pm ]. Taking m \u2192 \u221e, at the\nlevel of Dieudonn\u00e9 modules over k1 we get an epimorphism\n(23c)\n\n1\n\u03b8 : (M [ ], \u03c6) \u0589 (X \u2217 (Tk ) \u2297Z B(k1 ), 1X \u2217 (Tk ) \u2297 p\u03c3k1 )\np\n\nwhich (due to the uniqueness part of this paragraph) is compatible with the\nnatural F -actions. Here \u03c3k1 is the Frobenius automorphism of the field of fractions\nB(k1 ) of the ring W (k1 ) of Witt vectors with coefficients in k1 .\nFrom (23b) and (23c) we get that each (Mj , \u03c6) has Newton polygon slope 1.\nBut based on (iii) one can assume that the F -isocrystal (Mj0 , \u03c6) has no integral\nNewton polygon slope. Contradiction.\n8. Stratifications\nWe will use the notations listed in the beginning of Section 5. Let N (N )sv be the\nsmooth locus of N (N )v over O(v) ; its generic fibre is ShH(N ) (G, X ) (cf. Subsection\n4.2). In this Section we will study different stratifications of the special fibre\nL(N )sv of N (N )sv . We begin with few extra notations.\nLet \u03c8 \u2217 be the perfect alternating form on L\u2217 induced naturally by \u03c8. Let\nHZ(p) be the flat, closed subgroup scheme of GZ(p) which fixes \u03c8 \u2217 ; its generic\nfibre is a connected group HQ . Let (s\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J \u2286 T (W \u2217 ) be a family of tensors as\nin Subsection 3.4.2. We denote also by (V, \u039bV ) the pull back to N (N ) of the\nuniversal principally polarized abelian scheme over Ar,1,N (to be compared with\nSubsubsection 3.4.2). By replacing N with an integral power of itself, we can\nspeak about a family (v\u03b1V )\u03b1\u2208J of Hodge cycles on VQ obtained as in Subsubsection\n3.4.2. Such a replacement is irrelevant for this Section as we are interested in\npoints of N (N ) with values in k, W (k), or B(k). Here k is an algebraically closed\nfield of characteristic p, W (k) is the ring of Witt vectors with coefficients in k,\nand B(k) = W (k)[ p1 ] is the field of fractions of W (k). Let \u03c3k be the Frobenius\nautomorphism of k, W (k), or B(k).\nAll the results of Section 5 involve finite primes unramified over p. Due to\nthis in this Section we will assume that:\n(*) the prime v of E(G, X ) is unramified over p and the k(v)-scheme L(N )sv\nis non-empty.\nSee [Va7, Lem. 4.1] for a general criterion on when (*) holds.\n33\n\n\f8.1. F -crystals with tensors\nLet y : Spec(k) \u2192 L(N )sv . Let z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N (N )sv be a lift of y, cf. (*).\nLet (A, \u03bbA ) := z \u2217 ((V, \u039bV )N (N )sv ). Let\n(M, \u03c6, \u03c8M )\nbe the principally quasi-polarized Dieudonn\u00e9 module of (A, \u03bbA )k . Thus \u03c8M is a\nperfect alternating form on M such that we have \u03c8(\u03c6(a) \u2297 \u03c6(b)) = p\u03c3k (\u03c8(a \u2297 b))\nfor all a, b \u2208 M . The \u03c3k -linear automorphism \u03c6 : M [ p1 ]\u2192M\n \u0303 [ p1 ] extends naturally\n1\n1\n \u0303 (M [ p ]).\nto a \u03c3k -linear automorphism \u03c6 : T (M [ p ])\u2192T\nThe abelian variety AB(k) is endowed naturally with a family (v\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J of\nHodge cycles (it is obtained from the family (v\u03b1V )\u03b1\u2208J of Hodge cycles on VQ via a\nnatural pull back process). Let t\u03b1 \u2208 T (M [ p1 ]) be the de Rham component of v\u03b1 .\nLet F 1 be the Hodge filtration of M defined by the lift A of Ak . We have\n1 1\n\u03c6( p F + M ) = M . Let \u03bcz : Gm \u2192 GL M be the inverse of the canonical split\ncocharacter of (M, F 1 , \u03c6) defined in [We, p. 512]. It gives birth to a direct sum\ndecomposition M = F 1 \u2295 F 0 such that Gm acts via \u03bcz trivially on F 0 and via\nthe inverse of the identical character of Gm on F 1 .\nIt is known that the element t\u03b1 of T (M [ p1 ]) is a de Rham and thus also\ncrystalline cycle. If the abelian variety AB(k) is definable over a number subfield\nof B(k), then this result was known since long time (for instance, see [Bl, Thm.\n(0.3)]). The general case follows from loc. cit. and [Va1, Principle B of 5.2.16] (in\nthe part of [Va1, Subsect. 5.2] preceding the Principle B an odd prime is used;\nhowever the proof of loc. cit. applies to all primes). The fact that t\u03b1 is a crystalline\ncycle means that:\n(i) the tensor t\u03b1 belongs to the F 0 -filtration of T (M [ p1 ]) defined by F 1 [ p1 ] and\nit is fixed by \u03c6.\nLet GB(k) be the subgroup of GSp\nGSp(M [ p1 ], \u03c8M ) that fixes t\u03b1 for all \u03b1 \u2208 J . Let\nG be the Zariski closure of GB(k) in GSp\nGSp(M, \u03c8M ) (or GL M ); it is an affine, flat\ngroup scheme over W (k). We refer to the quadruple\nCy := (M, \u03c6, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , \u03c8M )\nas the principally quasi-polarized F -crystal with tensors attached to y \u2208 N (N )sv .\nIt is easy to see that this terminology makes sense (i.e., t\u03b1 depends only on\ny : Spec(k) \u2192 L(N )sv and not on the choice of the lift z : Spec(W (k)) \u2192 N (N )sv of\ny). We note down that G is uniquely determined by Cy . We refer to the quadruple\n1\nRy := (M [ ], \u03c6, (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , \u03c8M )\np\nas the principally quasi-polarized F -isocrystal with tensors attached to y \u2208\nN (N )sv . From (i) and the functorial aspects of [Wi, p. 513] we get that each tensor\nt\u03b1 is fixed by \u03bcz . This implies that:\n34\n\n\f(ii) the cocharacter \u03bcz : Gm \u2192 GL M factors through G and we denote also\nby \u03bcz : Gm \u2192 G this factorization.\nIf yi : Spec(k) \u2192 L(N )sv is a point indexed by the elements i of some set,\nthen we will use the index i to write down Cyi = (Mi , \u03c6i , (ti,\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , \u03c8Mi ) as well\nas Ryi = (Mi [ p1 ], \u03c6i , (ti,\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , \u03c8Mi ).\nIf yi : Spec(k) \u2192 L(N )v does not factor through L(N )sv , then we define\nCyi := (Mi , \u03c6i , \u03c8Mi ) to be the principally quasi-polarized Dieudonn\u00e9 module of\nyi\u2217 ((V, \u039bV )L(N )sv ). Similarly we define Ryi := (Mi [ p1 ], \u03c6i , \u03c8Mi ).1\nBefore studying different stratifications of L(N )sv defined naturally by basic\nproperties of the Cy 's, we will first present basic definitions on stratifications of\nreduced schemes over fields.\n8.2. Types of stratifications\nLet K be a field. By a stratification S of a reduced Spec(K)-scheme X (in potentially an infinite number of strata), we mean that:\n(i) for each field l that is either K or an algebraically closed field which\ncontains K and that has countable transcendental degree over K, a set Sl of\ndisjoint reduced, locally closed subschemes of Xl is given such that each point of\nXl with values in an algebraic closure of l factors through some element of Sl ;\n(ii) if i12 : l1 \u0592\u2192 l2 is an embedding between two fields as in (a), then the\nreduced scheme of the pull back to l2 of every member of Sl1 , is an element of\nSl2 ; thus we have a natural pull back injective map S(i12 ) : Sl1 \u0592\u2192 Sl2 .\nEach element s of some set Sl is referred as a stratum of S; we denote by s\u0304\nthe Zariski closure of s in Xl . If all maps S(i12 )'s are bijections, then we identify\nS with SK and we say S is of finite type.\nDef inition 6. We say that the stratification S has (or satisfies):\n(a) the strong purity property if for each field l as in (i) above and for every\nstratum s of Sl , locally in the Zariski topology of s\u0304 we have s = s\u0304a , where a is\nsome global function of s\u0304 and where s\u0304a is the largest open subscheme of s\u0304 over\nwhich a is an invertible function;\n(b) the purity property if for each field l as in (i) above, every element of Sl\nis an affine Xl -scheme (thus S has the purity property if and only if each stratum\nof it is an affine X-scheme);\n(c) the weak purity property if for each field l as in (i) above and for every\nstratum s of Sl , the scheme s\u0304 is noetherian and the complement of s in s\u0304 is either\nempty or has pure codimension 1 in s\u0304.\n1 For each lift of y to a point of N (N ) with values in a finite discrete valuation ring extension\nv\ni\nof W (k), one defines naturally a family of tensors (ti,\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J of T (Mi [ p1 ]). We do not know\nif this family of tensors: (i) does not depend on the choice of the lift and (ii) can be used in\nSubsections 8.4 and 8.5 in the same way as the families of tensors attached to k-valued points\nof L(N )sv .\n\n35\n\n\fAs the terminology suggests, the strong purity property implies the purity\nproperty and the purity property implies the weak purity property. The converses\nof these two statements do not hold. For instance, there exist affine, integral,\nnoetherian schemes Y which have open subschemes whose complements in Y have\npure codimension 1 in Y but are not affine (see [Va3, Rm. 6.3 (a)]).\n8.2.1. Example\nSuppose that K = k, that X is an integral k-scheme, and that there exists a\nBarsotti\u2013Tate group D of level 1 over X which generically is ordinary. Let O be\nthe stratification of X of finite type which has two strata: the ordinary locus s0\nof D and the non-ordinary locus sn of D. We have s\u0304o = X and s\u0304n = sn . Moreover\nlocally in the Zariski topology of X we have an identity so = Xa , where a is the\nglobal function on X which is the determinant of the Hasse\u2013Witt map of D. Thus\nthe stratification O has the strong purity property.\n8.3. Newton polygon stratification\nLet N be the stratification of L(N )v of finite type with the property that two\ngeometric points y1 , y2 : Spec(k) \u2192 L(N )v factor through the same stratum if\nand only if the Newton polygons of (M1 , \u03c61 ) and (M2 , \u03c62 ) coincide. In [dJO2] it\nis shown that N has the weak purity property (see [Zi2] for a more recent and\nnice proof of this).\nTheorem 7. The stratification N of L(N )v has the purity property.\nProof: The stratification N is the Newton polygon stratification of L(N )v defined\nby the F -crystal over L(N )v associated to the p-divisible group of VL(N )v . Thus\nthe Theorem is a particular case of [Va3, Main Thm. B].\n\u0003\n8.4. Rational stratification\nLet R be the stratification of L(N )sv with the property that two geometric points\ny1 , y2 : Spec(k) \u2192 L(N )sv factor through the same stratum if and only if there\n \u0303 y2 to be called a rational isomorphism.\nexists an isomorphism Ry1 \u2192R\nTheorem 8. The following three properties hold:\n(a) Each stratum of R is an open closed subscheme of a stratum of the restriction Ns of N to L(N )sv .\n(b) The stratification R of L(N )sv is of finite type.\n(c) The stratification R of L(N )sv has the purity property.\nProof: We use left lower indices to denote pulls back of F -crystals. Let l be either\nk(v) or an algebraically closed field that contains k(v) and that has countable\ntranscendental degree over k(v). Let S0 be a stratum of Ns contained in L(N )sv,l .\nLet S1 be an irreducible component of S0 . To prove the part (a) it suffices to\nshow that for each two geometric points y1 and y2 of S1 with values in the same\n36\n\n\f \u0303 y2 . We\nalgebraically closed field k, there exists a rational isomorphism Ry1 \u2192R\ncan assume that k is an algebraic closure of  \u0304l((x)) and that y1 and y2 factor\nthrough the generic point and the special point (respectively) of a morphism\nm : Spec(l\u0304[[x]]) \u2192 L(N )sv,l of l-schemes. Here x is an independent variable. We\ndenote also by y1 and y2 , the k-valued points of Spec(l\u0304[[x]]) or of its perfection\nSpec(l\u0304[[x]]perf ) defined naturally by the factorizations of y1 and y2 through m.\nLet \u03a6 be the Frobenius lift of W (l\u0304)[[x]] that is compatible with \u03c3l\u0304 and that\ntakes x to xp . Let V = (V, \u03c6V , \u03c8V , \u2207V ) be the principally quasi-polarized F crystal over  \u0304\nl[[x]] of m\u2217 ((V, \u039bV )L(N )sv,l ). Thus V is a free W (l\u0304)[[x]]-module of\nrank 2r equipped with a perfect alternating form \u03c8V , \u03c6V : V \u2192 V is a \u03a6-linear\nendomorphism, and \u2207V : V \u2192 V dx is a connection. Let tV\u03b1 \u2208 T (V [ p1 ]) be the\nde Rham realization of the Hodge cycle n\u2217B(l\u0304) (v\u03b1V ) on n\u2217B(k) ((V)N (N )sW (l) ), where\nn : Spec(W (l\u0304)[[x]]) \u2192 N (N )sW (l) is a lift of m.\nFontaine's comparison theory (see [Fo]) assures us that there exists an iso\u2217\n \u0303\n\u2297Q B(k), (s\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , \u03c8 \u2217 ).\nmorphism (M1 [ p1 ], (t1,\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208J , \u03c8M1 )\u2192(W\nBased on this and [Ko1] we get that Ry1 is isomorphic to the pull back to k of\nthe principally quasi-polarized F -isocrystal R1 with tensors defined naturally by\na principally quasi-polarized F -crystal C1 with tensors over an algebraic closure\nk(v) of k(v). Strictly speaking [Ko1] uses a language of \u03c3k -conjugacy classes of sets\nof the form G(B(k)) or HQ (B(k)) and not a language which involves polarizations\nand tensors (and thus which involves \u03c3k -conjugacy classes of sets of the form\nHQ (B(k))s0 , where s0 \u2208 G(B(k)) is an element whose image in (G/HQ )(B(k)) =\nGm (B(k)) belongs to (G/HQ )(Qp ) = Gm (Qp )); but the arguments of [Ko1] apply\nentirely in the present principally quasi-polarized context which involves sets of\nthe form HQ (B(k))s0 \u2286 G(B(k)). Here s0 is \u03bc0 [ p1 ], where \u03bc0 : Gm \u2192 GB(k) is an\narbitrary cocharacter whose extension to C via an O(v) -monomorphism B(k) \u0592\u2192 C\nis G(C)-conjugate to the cocharacters \u03bcx : Gm \u2192 GC with x \u2208 X .\nLet C1\u2212 be C1 but viewed only as an F -crystal over k(v). Let M1,1 be the\n\u2212\nvia an isomorphism\nW (k)-lattice of M1 [ p1 ] that corresponds naturally to C1,k\ni1,1 : R1,k \u2192R\n \u0303 y1 .\nFrom [Ka, Thm. 2.7.4] we get the existence of an isogeny i0 : V0 \u2192 V, where\nV0 is an F -crystal over  \u0304\nl[[x]] whose extension to the l\u0304[[x]]-subalgebra l\u0304[[x]]perf of k\nis constant (i.e., it is the pull back of an F -crystal over l\u0304). Let i0,k : M0 \u2192 M1 be\nthe W (k)-linear monomorphism that defines y1\u2217 (i0 ). We can assume that i0,k (M0 )\nis contained in M1,1 . The inclusion i0,k (M0 ) \u2286 M1,1 gives birth to a morphism\n\u2212\nj0 : V0,k \u2192 C1,k\nof F -crystals over k. It is the extension to k of a morphism\n\u2212\nj0perf : V0,l\u0304[[x]]perf \u2192 C1,\n, cf.

The proof of Theorem 8 (a) and (b) is in essence only a concrete\nvariant of a slight refinement of [RR, Thm. 3.8].

The particular case of this result when moreover GZ(p) is a\nreductive group scheme over Z(p) , is also claimed in [Ki].\n(b) If the statement (****) does not hold, then one has to work out what\nfollows with a fixed connected component of L(N )sv instead of with L(N )sv .\n(c) In many cases one can choose the cocharacter \u03bc0 : Gm \u2192 GW (k) in such\na way that the quadruple E0 is a canonical object of the family F0 . For instance,\nif GZ(p) is a reductive group scheme over Z(p) , then we have \u03bd0 = \u03bd and one can\nchoose \u03bc0 as follows. Let BZp be a Borel subgroup scheme of GZp := GZ(p) \u00d7Z(p)\nZp . Let TZp be a maximal torus of BZp . Let GW (k(v)) := GZp \u00d7Zp W (k(v)). Let\n\u03bc0,W (k(v) : Gm \u2192 GW (k(v)) be the unique cocharacter whose extension \u03bc0 : Gm \u2192\nGW (k) to W (k) belongs to the set \u03bd, which factors through TZp \u00d7Zp W (k(v)), and\n39\n\n\fthrough which Gm acts on Lie(BZp ) \u2297Zp W (k(v)) via the trivial and the identical\ncharacters of Gm (cf. [Mi3, Cor. 4.7 (b)]). As pairs of the form (BZp , TZp ) are\nGZp (Zp )-conjugate, the isomorphism class of E0 constructed via such a cocharacter\n\u03bc0 does not depend on the choice of (BZp , TZp ). Thus E0 is a canonical object of\nthe family F0 .\nTheorem 9. Under the assumptions (*) to (****) of this Section, the Ar,1,N,k(v) scheme L(N )sv is a quasi Shimura p-variety of Hodge type relative to F0 in the\nsense of [Va5, Def. 4.2.1].\nProof: As [Va5, Def. 4.2.1] is a very long definition, the essence of its parts will\nbe pointed out at the right time in this proof. We emphasize that due to (**) and\n(24), the group scheme H is smooth over W (k) and therefore the statement of\nthe Theorem makes sense.\nLet\n(25a)\n\nM0 = F01 \u2295 F00\n\nbe the direct sum decomposition such that Gm acts through \u03bc0 : Gm \u2192 GW (k)\ntrivially on F00 and via the inverse of the identical character of Gm on F01 . To\n(25a) corresponds a direct sum decomposition\n(25b)\n\nEnd(M0 ) = Hom(F00 , F01 ) \u2295 End(F00 ) \u2295 End(F01 ) \u2295 Hom(F01 , F00 )\n\nof W (k)-modules. Let Lie(H) = \u2295ii=\u22121 F\u03030i (Lie(H)) be the direct sum decomposition such that Gm acts trough \u03bc0 on F\u03030i (Lie(H)) via the \u2212i-th power of the\nidentity character of Gm . Thus we have an identity\n(25c)\n\nF\u03030\u22121 (Lie(H)) = Hom(F01 , F00 ) \u2229 Lie(H),\n\nthe intersection being taken inside End(M0 ). Let U be the connected, smooth,\nunipotent subgroup scheme of H defined by the following rule: if C is a commutative W (k)-algebra, then U(C) = 1M0 \u2297W (k) C + F\u03030\u22121 (Lie(H)) \u2297W (k) C.\nThe smooth k(v)-scheme L(N )sv is equidimensional of dimension d. As \u03bc0\nbelongs to \u03bd0 and thus to \u03bd, from Formula (17) we get that the rank e\u2212 of\nF\u03030\u22121 (Lie(H)) is precisely d. Thus the smooth k(v)-scheme L(N )sv is equidimensional of dimension e\u2212 . In other words, the axiom (i) of [Va5, Def. 4.2.1] holds.\nLet Ry be the completion of the local ring of N (N )sW (k) at its k-valued point\ndefined by y. We fix an identification Ry = W (k)[[x1 , . . . , xd ]]. Let \u03a6 be the\nFrobenius lift of Ry which is compatible with \u03c3k and which takes xi to xpi for all\ni \u2208 {1, . . . , d}. We have a natural morphism Spec(Ry ) \u2192 N (N )s which is formally\n\u00e9tale. The principally quasi-polarized filtered F -crystal over Ry /pRy of the pull\nback to Spec(Ry ) of (V, \u039bV ) is isomorphic to\n(26a)\n\n(M0 \u2297W (k) Ry , F01 \u2297W (k) Ry , hy (gy \u03c60 \u2297 \u03a6), \u03c8 \u2217 , \u2207y ),\n\nwhere hy \u2208 H(Ry ) is such that modulo the ideal (x1 , . . . , xd ) of Ry is the identity\nelement of H(W (k)) and where \u2207y is an integrable, nilpotent modulo p connection\non M0 \u2297W (k) Ry . We have:\n40\n\n\f(i) for each element \u03b1 \u2208 J , the tensor t\u03b1 \u2208 T (M0 [ p1 ]) \u2297B(k) Ry [ p1 ] =\nT (M0 \u2297W (k) Ry [ p1 ]) is the de Rham realization of the pull back to Spec(Ry [ p1 ]) of\nthe Hodge cycle v\u03b1V on VQ and therefore it is annihilated by \u2207y ;\n(ii) the connection \u2207y is versal.\nThe two properties (i) and (ii) hold as, up to W (k)-automorphisms of Ry that\nleave invariant its ideal (x1 , . . . , xd ), we can choose the morphism hy : Spec(Ry ) \u2192\nH to factor through a formally \u00e9tale morphism hy \u2192 U (i.e., we can choose\nhy to be the universal element of the completion of U). If GZ(p) is a reductive\ngroup scheme, then the fact that such a choice of hy is possible follows from\n[Va1, Subsect. 5.4]. The general case is entirely the same (for instance, cf. [Va7,\nSubsects. 3.3 and 3.4]).\nWe recall the standard argument that \u2207y annihilates each t\u03b1 with \u03b1 \u2208 J .\nWe view T (M0 ) as a module over the Lie algebra (associated to) End(M0 ) and\naccordingly we denote also by \u2207y the connection on T (M0 \u2297W (k) Ry [ p1 ]) which\nextends naturally the connection \u2207y on M0 \u2297W (k) Ry . The \u03a6-linear action of\nhy (gy \u03c60 \u2297 \u03a6) on M0 \u2297W (k) Ry extends to a \u03a6-linear action of hy (gy \u03c60 \u2297 \u03a6) on\nT (M0 \u2297W (k) Ry [ p1 ]). For instance, if a \u2208 M0\u2217 \u2297W (k) Ry = (M0 \u2297W (k) Ry )\u2217 and if\nb \u2208 M0 \u2297W (k) Ry , then [hy (gy \u03c60 \u2297\u03a6)](a) \u2208 M0\u2217 \u2297W (k) Ry [ p1 ] maps [hy (gy \u03c60 \u2297\u03a6)](b)\nto \u03a6(a(b)). As \u03c60 , gy , and hy fix t\u03b1 , the tensor t\u03b1 \u2208 T (M0 \u2297W (k) Ry [ p1 ]) is also fixed\nby hy (gy \u03c60 \u2297 \u03a6). The connection \u2207y is the unique connection on M0 \u2297W (k) Ry\nsuch that we have an identity\n\u2207y \u25e6 [hy (gy \u03c60 \u2297 \u03a6)] = [hy (gy \u03c60 \u2297 \u03a6)] \u2297 d\u03a6) \u25e6 \u2207y ,\ncf. [Fa2, Thm. 10]. From the last two sentences we get that\n\u2207y (t\u03b1 ) = [hy (gy \u03c60 \u2297 \u03a6) \u2297 d\u03a6](\u2207y (t\u03b1 )).\nAs we have d\u03a6(xi ) = pxp\u22121\ndxi for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , d}, by induction on q \u2208 N we\ni\n1\n\u2227\nget that \u2207y (t\u03b1 ) \u2208 T (M0 ) \u2297W (k) (x1 , . . . , xd )q \u03a9\u2227\nRy /W (k) [ p ]. Here \u03a9Ry /W (k) is the\np-adic completion of the sheaf of relative 1-differential forms. As Ry is complete\nwith respect to the (x1 , . . . , xd )-topology, we have \u2207y (t\u03b1 ) = 0.\nDue to the property (ii), the morphism L(N )sv \u2192 Ad,1,N,k induces kepimorphisms at the level of complete, local rings of residue field k i.e., it is a\nformal closed embedding at all k-valued points (this is precisely the statement of\n[Va7, Part I, Thm. 1.5 (b)]). Thus the axiom (ii) of [Va5, Def. 4.2.1] holds.\nBased on the property (i) and a standard application of Artin's approximation\ntheorem, we get that there exists an \u00e9tale map \u03b7y : Spec(Ey ) \u2192 N (N )sW (k) whose\nimage contains the k-valued point of N (N )sW (k) defined naturally by y and for\nwhich the following three properties hold:\n(iii) the p-adic completion Ey\u2227 of Ey has a Frobenius lift \u03a6Ey ;\n(iv) the principally quasi-polarized filtered F -crystal over Ey /pEy of the pull\nback to Spec(Ey /pEy ) of (V, \u039bV ) is isomorphic to\n41\n\n\f(26b)\n\n(M0 \u2297W (k) Ey\u2227 , F01 \u2297W (k) Ey\u2227 , jy (gy \u03c60 \u2297 \u03a6Ey ), \u03c8 \u2217 , \u2207alg\ny ),\n\nwhere jy \u2208 H(Ey\u2227 ) and where \u2207alg\ny is an integrable, nilpotent modulo p connection\non M0 \u2297W (k) Ry which is versal at each k-valued point of Spec(Ey\u2227 );\n(v) for each element \u03b1 \u2208 J , the tensor t\u03b1 \u2208 T (M0 [ p1 ] \u2297B(k) Ey\u2227 [ p1 ]) =\nT (M0 \u2297W (k) Ey\u2227 [ p1 ]) is the de Rham realization of the pull back to Spec(Ey\u2227 [ p1 ])\nof the Hodge cycle v\u03b1V on VQ and therefore it is annihilated by \u2207alg\ny .\nLet \u03b7\u0304y : Spec(Ey /pEy ) \u2192 L(N )sv,k be the \u00e9tale map defined naturally by \u03b7y .\nLet Ik be a finite set of k-valued points of L(N )sv such that we have an identity\n\u222a\u1ef9\u2208Ik Im(\u03b7\u0304\u1ef9 ) = L(N )sv .\nThis means that the axiom (iii.a) of [Va5, Def. 4.2.1] holds for the family of \u00e9tale\nmaps (\u03b7\u0304\u1ef9 )\u1ef9\u2208Ik .\nLet W+0 be the maximal parabolic subgroup scheme of GL M0 that normalizes\nH\nF01 . Let W+0\n:= H \u2229 W+0 ; it is a smooth subgroup scheme of H (cf. [Va5, Lem.\n\u2227\n4.1.2]). As \u2207alg\ny is versal at each k-valued point of Spec(Ey ), we have:\n(vi) the reduction modulo p of jy is a morphism Spec(Ey /pEy ) \u2192 Hk whose\nH\ncomposite with the quotient morphism Hk \u0589 Hk /W+0,k\nis \u00e9tale.\nProperty (vi) implies that the axiom (iii.b) of [Va5, Def. 4.2.1] holds for\n(\u03b7\u0304\u1ef9 )\u1ef9\u2208Ik .\nBased on properties (iv) and (v), it is easy to see that the axiom (iii.c) of\n[Va5, Def. 4.2.1] holds for (\u03b7\u0304\u1ef9 )\u1ef9\u2208Ik .\nThe fact that the axiom (iii.d) of [Va5, Def. 4.2.1] holds as well for (\u03b7\u0304\u1ef9 )\u1ef9\u2208Ik\nis only a particular case of Faltings' deformation theory [Fa, \u00a77, Thm. 10 and\nRm. i) to iii) after it], cf. the versality part of the property (iv). More precisely, if\n\u03c9 \u2208 Ker(H(Ry ) \u0589 H(Ry /(x1 , . . . , xd ))) is such that the composite of \u03c9 modulo p\nH\nwith the quotient morphism Hk \u0589 Hk /W+0,k\nis formally \u00e9tale, then there exists\nan W (k)-automorphism ay : Ry \u2192R\n \u0303 y that leaves invariant the ideal (x1 , . . . , xd )\nand for which the extension of (26a) via ay is isomorphic to\n(M0 \u2297W (k) Ry , F01 \u2297W (k) Ry , \u03c9(gy \u03c60 \u2297 \u03a6), \u03c8 \u2217 , \u2207y )\nunder an isomorphism defined by an element of Ker(H(Ry ) \u0589 H(Ry /(x1 , . . . , xd ))).\nThus axioms (i) to (iii) of [Va5, Def. 4.2.1] hold i.e., L(N )sv is a quasi Shimura\np-variety of Hodge type relative to F0 in the sense of [Va5, Def. 4.2.1].\n\u0003\n8.6. Level m stratification\nWe assume that properties (*) to (****) of this Section hold. Let m be a\npositive integer. From Theorem 9 and [Va5, Cor. 4.3] we get that there exists a stratification Lm of L(N )sv with the property that two geometric points\ny1 , y2 : Spec(k) \u2192 L(N )sv factor through the same stratum if and only Egy1 [pm ] is\ninner isomorphic to Egy2 [pm ]. We call Lm as the level m stratification of L(N )sv .\nAmong its many properties we list here only three:\n42\n\n\fProposition 6. Let l be either k(v) or an algebraically closed field of countable\ntranscendental degree over k(v). Let n be a stratum of Ns which is a locally closed\nsubscheme of L(N )sv,l . Then we have:\n(a) there exists a family (li )i\u2208L(n) of strata of L\u2308 r2 \u2309 which are locally closed\nsubschemes of L(N )sv,l and such that we have an identity\nn(l\u0304) = \u222ai\u2208L(n) li (l\u0304);\n\n(45)\n\n(b) the scheme n is regular and equidimensional;\n(c) the L(N )sv,l -scheme n is quasi-affine.\nProof: The Newton polygon of a p-divisible group D over k of codimension c and\ncd\ndimension d is uniquely determined by D[p\u2308 c+d \u2309 ], cf. [NV2, Thm. 1.2]. Thus the\nNewton polygon of (M, \u03c6) is uniquely determined by the inner isomorphism class\nr\nof Egy [p\u2308 2 \u2309 ]. From this the part (a) follows.\nParts (b) and (c) are particular cases of [Va5, Cor. 4.3].\n\u0003\nRemark 6. (a) For PEL type Shimura varieties, the idea of level m stratifications\nshows up first in [We]. The level 1 stratifications generalize the Ekedahl\u2013Oort\nstratifications studied extensively by Kraft, Ekedahl, Oort, Wedhorn, Moonen, and\nvan der Geer.\n(b) Suppose that GZ(p) is a reductive group scheme and that the properties (*)\nand (***) of this Section hold. As GZ(p) is a reductive group scheme, it is easy to\nsee that the properties (**) and (****) hold as well. Thus the level m stratification\nLm exists. It is known that L1 has a finite number of strata (see [Va10, Sect. 12]).\n8.6.1. Problem\nStudy when Lm has the purity property.\n8.7. Traverso stratifications\nWe continue to assume that properties (*) to (****) of this Section hold. Let\nnv \u2208 N\nbe the smallest positive integer such that for all elements g \u2208 H(W (k)) and\ng1 \u2208 Ker(H(W (k)) \u2192 H(Wnv (k))), the quadruples Eg and Egg1 are isomorphic.\nThe existence of nv is implied by [Va3, Main Thm. A].\nLemma 1. We assume that the assumptions (*) to (****) of this Section hold.\nLet g1 , g2 \u2208 H(W (k)). The D-truncations of level m of Eg1 and Eg2 are inner isomorphic if and only if there exists g3 \u2208 H(W (k)) such that we have\ng3 g2 \u03c60 g3\u22121 = g0 g1 \u03c60 for some element g0 \u2208 Ker(H(W (k)) \u2192 H(Wm (k))).\n43\n\n\fProof: This is only a principal quasi-polarized variant of [Va3, Lem. 3.2.2].\nIts proof is entirely the same as of loc. cit.\n\u0003\nDue to Lemma 1, from the very definition of nv we get that for every two\nelements g1 , g2 \u2208 H(W (k)) we have the following equivalence:\n(i) Eg1 is isomorphic to Eg2 if and only if Eg1 [pny ] is isomorphic to Eg2 [pny ].\nDue to the property (i), for m \u2265 nv we have an identity\nLm = Lnv .\nWe refer to\nT := Lnv\nas the Traverso stratification of L(N )sv . Such stratifications were studied in [Tr1]\nto [Tr2] (using the language of group actions), in [Oo] (using the language of\nfoliations), and in [Va3] and [Va5] (using the language of ultimate or Traverso\nstratifications). Based on Theorem 9, the next Theorem is only a particular case\nof [Va5, Cor. 4.3.1 (b)].\nTheorem 10. Under the assumptions (*) to (****) of this Section, the Traverso\nstratification T of L(N )sv has the purity property.\n8.7.1. Problems\n1. Find upper bounds for nv which are sharp.\n2. Study the dependence of nv on v.\n8.7.2. Example\nWe assume that f is an isomorphism i.e., we have an identification (G, X ) =\nGSp\n(GSp\nGSp(W, \u03c8), S). We have v = p and thus we will denote nv by np . We also assume\nthat y is a supersingular point i.e., all Newton polygon slopes of (M, \u03c6) are 12 .\nThe isomorphism class of (M, \u03c6, \u03c8M ) is uniquely determined by Egy [pr ], cf. [NV1,\nThm. 1.3]. Moreover, in general we can not replace in the previous sentence Egy [pr ]\nby Egy [pr\u22121 ] (cf. [NV1, Example 3.3] and the result [Va3, Prop. 5.3.3] which says\nthat each principally quasi-polarized Dieudonn\u00e9 module over k is the one attached\nto a principally polarized abelian variety over k).\nTherefore, the restrictions of T and Lr to the (reduced) supersingular locus\nof Ar,1,N,Fp = L(N )p = L(N )sp coincide and we have an inequality\nnp \u2265 r.\nBased on Traverso's isomorphism conjecture (cf. [Tr3, \u00a740, Conj. 4] or [NV1, Conj.\n1.1]), one would be inclined to expect that np is in fact exactly r. However, we\nare not at all at the point where we could state this as a solid expectation.\n44\n\n\fReferences\n[Bl] D.
