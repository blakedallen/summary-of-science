By contrast, the Einstein-Hilbert action of general relativity depends also on the\nsecond derivative of the fundamental field, the space-time metric g. As a consequence, stationary points of this action do not yield Einstein's equations unless both the metric and\nits first derivatives are kept fixed at the boundary; strictly we do not have a well-defined\nvariational principle. To remedy this situation, Gibbons and Hawking [1, 2] proposed that\nwe add a surface term to the Einstein Hilbert action. We are then led to\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\nZ\n1\n3\n4\nSEH+GH (g) =\nRd V + 2\nKd V +C .\n(1.1)\n2\u03ba\nM\n\u2202M\nHere \u03ba = 8\u03c0G, M is a 4-manifold representing an appropriate portion of space-time, \u2202M\nits boundary, R the Ricci scalar of the metric g, K the trace of the extrinsic curvature of\n\u2202M, and C is an arbitrary function of the metric h induced on \u2202M by g.\nLet us restrict ourselves to cases where g has signature -,+,+,+ and is smooth and globally\nhyperbolic. We will let M be the space-time region bounded between two Cauchy surfaces.\nIf M is spatially compact, by setting C = 0, we obtain a well-defined variational principle\nand a finite on-shell action. However, in the asymptotically flat case, it is well-known\nthat this strategy has some important limitations (see e.g., [3]). In particular, the action is\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: ashtekar@gravity.psu.edu\nElectronic address: engle@cpt.univ-mrs.fr\n\u2021\nElectronic address: sloan@gravity.psu.edu\n\u2020\n\n\f2\ntypically infinite even 'on-shell', and indeed even when g is the Minkowski metric. To remedy\nthis problem, Gibbons and Hawking [1, 2] proposed an infinite subtraction: Carry out an\nisometric embedding of (\u2202M, h) in Minkowski space, calculate the trace Ko of the extrinsic\ncurvature of \u2202M defined by the Minkowski metric, and set C = \u2212Ko . Can this procedure\nbe carried out for generic asymptotically flat Lorentzian metrics g? Now, there is a theorem\ndue to Weyl which guarantees that any 2-manifold with a metric of positive scalar curvature\ncan be isometrically embedded in the Euclidean 3-space. One may imagine that this result\ncould be extended to higher dimensional Minkowski spaces. However, this expectation is\nnot borne out. For, in a d dimensional space-time the metric h on the boundary \u2202M has\nd(d \u2212 1)/2 \u2212 (d \u2212 1) degrees of freedom (after removing the diffeomorphism gauge) while\nthe choice of embedding provides a freedom worth only one function on \u2202M. Thus, even\nat this heuristic level, if d \u2265 4 the freedom is not sufficient whence this infinite subtraction\nprocedure will not work for generic metrics g.\nOver the last few years, a new set of proposals for infinite counter terms C have appeared\nin the literature, motivated in part by earlier work of Brown and York [4]. In particular, Kraus, Larsen, Siebelink [5] have constructed a counter-term using a (non-polynomial)\nfunction of the Ricci curvature of the boundary. Mann and Marolf [3] have introduced a\ncounter-term which is closer to the spirit of the Gibbons-Hawking proposal. They replace\no\nKo with the trace of a tensor field K\u0302ab which generalizes the extrinsic curvature Kab\nof \u2202M\nwith respect to the Minkowski metric, used by Gibbons and Hawking, to situations in which\nthe boundary may not be isometrically embedable in Minkowski space. The Mann-Marolf\nprocedure is motivated by the form of the Gauss Codazzi equations and is carried out entirely in the physical space-time, without recourse to any embedding. Not only do these\nimproved actions Simp lead to well-defined action principles, but they also overcome another\nlimitation of the original proposal: Now \u03b4Simp = 0 at asymptotically flat solutions for all\npermissible variations \u03b4.\nSince we are dealing just with classical field theories where all fields are smooth, one\nmight wonder if there is a way to avoid infinite subtractions altogether and construct an\naction principle which is manifestly finite from the beginning. The first goal of this paper is\nto show in some detail that this is indeed possible if one uses a first order framework based\non orthonormal tetrads and Lorentz connections.1 It is worth noting that this framework\nconstitutes the starting point of Hamiltonian loop quantum gravity as well as spin-foams.\nThe second goal of the paper is to use this action to construct a covariant Hamiltonian framework by keeping careful track of boundary conditions.2 It is well-known that the asymptotic\nstructure is quite subtle in 4-dimensions because of the presence of logarithmic translations\nand super-translations [10, 11]. These subtleties lead to considerable complications in the\ndefinition of asymptotic symmetries and conserved quantities. The ensuing difficulties were\novercome in discussions of conserved quantities based on field equations quite sometime ago\n[10\u201314]. However, in much of the older literature on the derivation of Hamiltonians from\naction, these subtleties were generally overlooked (see, e.g., [15\u201317]). We will fill this gap\nstarting with the first order action principle, thus providing a self-contained Lagrangian\n1\n\n2\n\nThis fact was used in [6, 7] where, however, attention was focused on the inner, isolated horizon boundary\nrather than at infinity.\nFor a complementary treatment in the canonical framework, see [8, 9]. However, that analysis is based on\nself-dual, rather than real Lorentz-connections and did not address issues involving the action principle\ndiscussed above.\n\n\f3\nand Hamiltonian description without the need of any infinite counter-terms. The first order framework also has the technical advantage that calculations can be carried out using\nexterior calculus and tend to be significantly simpler.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II we recall the asymptotic structure at spatial infinity in 4 dimensions and in section III we introduce the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian\nframework using the first order framework. A careful choice of boundary conditions eliminates the logarithmic and super translations and reduces the asymptotic symmetry group to\nPoincar\u00e9. In section IV we calculate the Hamiltonians generating these Poincar\u00e9 symmetries\nand in section V we discuss their properties. In particular, although they are now defined\nusing entirely different techniques these expressions of Poincar\u00e9-momentum agree with the\nearlier ones [10, 12\u201314] obtained using field equations. In this respect results of section\nV are similar to those obtained by Mann, Marolf and Virmani [3, 18] using their infinite\ncounter-term subtraction in the second order framework. Section VI summarizes the results\nand discusses their relevance to recent developments concerning the spectral action used in\nnon-commutative geometry [19, 20].\nII.\n\nASYMPTOTIC STRUCTURE: SUBTLETIES IN 4 DIMENSIONS\n\nIn this section we will introduce some notation, specify our boundary conditions at spatial\ninfinity and discuss some important complications that are peculiar to 4 dimensions.\nLet \u03b7 be a Minkowski metric on R4 . Since we are primarily interested in spatial infinity,\nwe will focus on the region R which lies outside the light cone of some point p in the\ninterior. On R the 4-dimensional radial coordinate \u03c1 is given by \u03c12 = \u03b7ab xa xb where xa are\nthe Cartesian coordinates of \u03b7 with p as origin. Functions f of interest will admit a power\nseries expansion of the type\nm n\nX\nf (\u03a6)\nf (\u03c1, \u03a6) =\n+ o(\u03c1\u2212m )\nn\n\u03c1\nn=0\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03a6 = (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03c7) are the standard angles on hyperboloids H defined by \u03c1 = const and\nwhere the remainder o(\u03c1\u2212m ) has the property that lim\u03c1\u2192\u221e \u03c1m o(\u03c1\u2212m ) = 0. Such a function\nwill be said to admit an asymptotic expansion to order m. A tensor field T a...b c...d will be said\nto admit an asymptotic expansion to order m if all its components in the Cartesian chart xa\ndo so. Derivatives \u2202T a...b c...d/\u2202xe of such a tensor field with respect to xe will be assumed\nto admit an asymptotic expansion to order m + 1. Finally, note that the remainder in (2.1)\ncan contain terms of the type (h(\u03a6) ln \u03c1)/\u03c1m+1 whence lim\u03c1\u2192\u221e \u03c1m+1 o(\u03c1\u2212n ) need not exist.\nA smooth space-time metric g on R will be said to be weakly asymptotically flat at spatial\ninfinity if there exists a Minkowski metric \u03b7 such that outside a spatially compact world tube\ng \u2212 \u03b7 admits an asymptotic expansion to order 1 and lim\u03c1\u2192\u221e (g \u2212 \u03b7) = 0. This condition\nimplies that in the (\u03c1, \u03a6) chart associated with \u03b7, the line element of g can be expanded as\nfollows:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n2\u03c3(\u03a6)\nAi (\u03a6)\nhij\na\nb\n2\ni\n2\ngab dx dx = 1 +\nd\u03c1 + 2\u03c1\nd\u03a6i d\u03a6j + o(\u03c1\u22121 )\nd\u03c1 d\u03a6 + \u03c1 hij +\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n(2.2)\nwhere hij is the metric on the unit (time-like) hyperboloid in Minkowski space. Given such an\nexpansion, it is tempting to think of \u03b7 as a reference metric, consider its Poincar\u00e9 group as the\n\n\f4\nasymptotic symmetry group of g and define Poincar\u00e9 momentum -i.e., energy-momentum\nand relativistic angular momentum- using Hamiltonians generating these transformations\non the appropriate phase space. Indeed, this is often done in the literature. However, the\nproblem is that the metric \u03b7 is not uniquely singled out by the physical metric g. For, if g\nadmits an asymptotic expansion (2.2) with respect to one Minkowski metric \u03b7, it also admits\nthis expansion with respect to another Minkowski metric \u03b7\u0304 if \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7\u0304 admits an asymptotic\nexpansion to order 1 and lim\u03c1\u2192\u221e (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7\u0304) = 0. Such Minkowskian metrics will be said to\nbe compatible. One might first think that the Poincar\u00e9 groups of compatible metric would\nagree asymptotically. Unfortunately, as we now show, this is not the case in 4 dimensions.\nSet\nx\u0304a = La b xb + ln \u03c1 C a + T a + S a (\u03a6) + o(\u03c10 )\n(2.3)\nb\nb\nd\na\na\nwhere La is a Lorentz transformation (i.e. La Lc \u03b7bd = \u03b7ac ), and T , C are constant vector\nfields with respect to \u03b7. Let \u03b7\u0304 ab be the Minkowski metric for which x\u0304a is the Cartesian chart.\nThen it is easy to check that \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0304 are compatible. If C a and S a (\u03a6) were set to zero, x\u0304a\nwould be just another Cartesian chart for \u03b7 to leading order whence Poincar\u00e9 groups of \u03b7\u0304\nand \u03b7 would have agreed asymptotically. The term C a ln \u03c1 defines a logarithmic translation\nwhile the angle dependent translation S a (\u03c6) is called a super-translation. If C a and/or\nS a (\u03a6) are non-zero, the Poincar\u00e9 groups of \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0304 fail to agree even at infinity. Since one\ncan define Poincar\u00e9 momentum using any of them, there is considerable ambiguity in the\nvalues of conserved quantities. The ambiguity introduced by logarithmic translations was\nfirst pointed out by Bergmann [21] while that associated with super-translations was first\nobserved at null infinity by Bondi and Sachs [22] and later at spatial infinity in [10]. These\ncomplications arise because, for physical reasons, we can only ask that g \u2212 \u03b7 should fall off\nas (\u03c1\u22121 ) in 4 dimensions. Had we demanded that they fall off as (\u03c1\u22122 ), we would have been\nforced to set C a and S a (\u03a6) to zero and the ambiguities would have disappeared. But of\ncourse, because of the positive energy theorem, in this case the only solution satisfying our\nputative boundary conditions would have been Minkowski space! In d space-time dimensions,\nthe physically correct condition is that g \u2212 \u03b7 should fall off as (\u03c1\u2212(d\u22123) ), whence there is no\nfreedom to perform super-translations or logarithmic translations if d > 4.\nThe challenge in 4-dimensions, then, is to strengthen the boundary conditions so that\nthis freedom is eliminated without excessively limiting permissible space-time geometries.\nLet us begin with the logarithmic translations. It is straightforward to verify that under\nxa \u2192 x\u0304a = ln \u03c1 C a , we are led to a Minkowski metric \u03b7\u0304 and hence the 'barred'-version of the\nexpansion (2.2) in which\n\u03b7ab xb\n.\n(2.4)\n\u03c1\nNote that for any non-zero C a , C a x\u0302a is function on the hyperboloids H which is odd under the\nreflection x\u0302a \u2192 \u2212x\u0302a . Therefore, one can eliminate the freedom to perform the logarithmic\ntranslations by simply demanding that in the asymptotic expansion (2.2), \u03c3(\u03a6) be even under\nthese reflections [11]. How stringent is this requirement on \u03c3? Analysis of the asymptotic\nstructure at spatial infinity at io ties it to the asymptotic behavior of the 'electric' part\nEab = Cacbd x\u0302c x\u0302d of the Weyl tensor. The leading asymptotic part of Eab is a tensor field\ntangential to H given by\n3\nEab (\u03a6) := lim \u03c13 Eab .\n(2.5)\n\u03c3\u0304(\u03a6) = \u03c3(\u03a6) + C a x\u0302a\n\nwhere x\u0302a =\n\n\u03c1\u2192\u221e\n\nIt admits a scalar potential which is precisely \u03c3: 3Eab = \u2212(Da Db \u03c3 + \u03c3hab ), where D is the\nderivative operator of (H, hab ) [12\u201314]. Now one can show that if 3Eab is reflection-symmetric,\n\n\f5\none can always choose a flat metric \u03b7 so that \u03c3 is also reflection symmetric. Thus, to\neliminate logarithmic translations one only needs to ask that 3Eab be reflection symmetric and\nthen restrict oneself to asymptotic expansions (2.2) in which \u03c3 is also reflection symmetric.\nFinally, the symmetry condition on 3Eab is not excessively restrictive. For example, it is\nsatisfied if g is asymptotically a finite superposition of Schwarzschild metrics with (possibly)\ndistinct asymptotic time translations [23].\nNext, let us consider super-translations. We first note a result due to Beig and Schmidt\n[13]: Given a metric g that admits an expansion (2.2), one can always find another Minkowski\nmetric (which, for simplicity, we will denote by \u03b7 again) such that the off-diagonal terms\nvanish to leading order. Thus, in the (\u03c1, \u03a6) chart of the new Minkowski metric, we have:\nds2 = (1 +\n\n1\n2\u03c3\nhij\n)d\u03c12 + \u03c12 (hij +\n) d\u03a6i d\u03a6j + o(\u03c1\u22121 ) .\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere, by our assumption above, \u03c3(\u03a6) is reflection-symmetric on H. For this metric g one\ncan calculate the asymptotic Weyl curvature which can be decomposed into an electric and\na magnetic parts. The leading order magnetic part is a tensor field tangential to H, given\nby:\n3\nBab = lim \u22c6 Cacbd x\u0302c x\u0302d .\n(2.7)\n\u03c1\u2192\u221e\n\n3\n\nBab admits a natural tensor potential Sab := 1 hab + 2\u03c3 hab on H:\nBab = \u01eba mn Dm Snb\nwhere \u01eb and D are the alternating tensor and the derivative operator on the hyperboloid H\ncompatible with the metric hab , and indices are raised and lowered by hab . Under supertranslations, xa \u2192 x\u0304a = xa + S a (\u03a6), the field 3Bab itself is left invariant while the potential\ntransforms non-trivially:\n\u03c3\u0304 = \u03c3,\n\n1\n\nh\u0304ab = 1hab \u2212 2Da Db f \u2212 2f hab ,\n\nso that S\u0304ab = Sab \u2212 2Da Db f \u2212 2f hab ,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere the function f on H is given by f = f a x\u0302a . Finally, one can show that if 3Bab vanishes,\nthen this transformation property of Sab is sufficient to ensure that (via a suitable supertranslation) we can always choose \u03b7 such that Sab = 0, i.e., 1hab = \u22122\u03c3hab [10, 12\u201314]. The\ntransformation property (2.8) immediately implies that this exhausts the super-translation\nfreedom. The condition 3Bab = 0 is not excessively stringent. For example, it is automatically\nsatisfied if g is stationary or axi-symmetric [24]\nLet us summarize. If the asymptotic Weyl curvature of a weakly asymptotically flat\nspace-time (M, gab ) is such that its leading order term is purely electric (i.e. if 3Bab = 0) and\nreflection symmetric on H, then one can eliminate both super-translations and logarithmic\ntranslations by strengthening the boundary conditions in a natural fashion by requiring in\n(2.6) that \u03c3 be reflection symmetric and 1hab = \u22122\u03c3hab . Thus, the metrics g satisfying this\nadditional conditions can be expanded as\nds2 = (1 +\n\n2\u03c3\n2\u03c3 2\n) d\u03c12 + (1 \u2212\n) \u03c1 hij d\u03a6i d\u03a6j + o(\u03c1\u22121 ) ,\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is reflection symmetric. Such space-times will be said to be asymptotically flat\nat spatial infinity. If a given physical metric g satisfies this condition with respect to two\ndistinct Minkowski metrics \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0304, then their isometry groups agree to leading order: If K a\nis a Killing vector of \u03b7, there exists a Killing vector K\u0304 a of \u03b7\u0304 such that lim\u03c1\u2192\u221e K a \u2212 K\u0304 a = 0.\nHamiltonians generating these asymptotic symmetries provide unambiguous definitions of\n\n\f6\nconserved quantities at spatial infinity. We will see that the additional conditions on \u03c3 and\nhab are essential for surface integral expressions of the Lorentz angular momentum to be\nwell-defined.\nThus, although the asymptotic structure is quite subtle in 4 dimensions, one can\nstrengthen the 'obvious' boundary conditions to eliminate the logarithmic translations and\nsuper-translations and yet admit a very large class of physically interesting examples. (For\na treatment of these issues in a canonical framework, see [25].)\n1\n\nIII.\n\nACTION AND THE COVARIANT PHASE SPACE\n\nWe can now construct the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian descriptions in the first order\nframework. Our basic gravitational variables will be co-triads eIa and Lorentz connections\nAIJ\na on space-time M. Co-tetrads e are 'square-roots' of metrics and the transition from\nmetrics to tetrads is motivated by the fact that tetrads are essential if one is to introduce\nspinorial matter. eIa is an isomorphism between the tangent space Tp (M) at any point p\nand a fixed internal vector space V equipped with a metric \u03b7IJ with Lorentzian signature.\nThe internal indices can be freely lowered and raised using this fiducial \u03b7IJ and its inverse\n\u03b7 IJ . Each co-tetrad defines a space-time metric by gab := eIa eJb \u03b7IJ which also has signature\n(\u2212 + ++). Then the co-triad e is automatically orthonormal with respect to g. Since the\nJI\nconnection 1-forms A take values in the Lorentz Lie algebra, AIJ\na = \u2212Aa . The connection\nacts only on internal indices and defines a derivative operator\nDa kI := \u2202a kI + AaI J kJ ,\nwhere \u2202 is a fiducial derivative operator which, as usual, will be chosen to be flat and torsion\nfree. As fundamental fields, e and A are independent. However, the equation of motion of\nA implies that A is compatible with e, i.e., is fully determined by e. Therefore, boundary\nconditions on A are motivated by those on e. These in turn are dictated by our discussion\nof asymptotics in section II.\nIn the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks we have to first introduce the precise\nspace of dynamical fields of interest. Let us fix, once and for all, a co-frame oeIa such\no\nthat gab\n= \u03b7IJ oeIa oeJb is flat. The derivative operator defined by oeIa will be denoted by\no\n\u2202a ; \u2202a oeIb = 0. The cartesian coordinates xa of gab\nand the associated radial-hyperboloid\ni\ncoordinates (\u03c1, \u03a6 ) will be used in asymptotic expansions. Discussion of section II suggests\nthat the co-triads eIa should admit an asymptotic expansion of order 1. This suffices to obtain\nwell-defined 4-momentum. However, detailed analysis shows that to define the Lorentz\nangular momentum one needs eIa to admit an expansion to order 2 (see Sec. IV). Therefore,\nwe will assume that eIa can be expanded as:\ne = oe(\u03a6) +\nwhere 1 eIa is given by\n\n1 I\nea\n\n1\n\ne(\u03a6) 2 e(\u03a6)\n+\n+ o(\u03c1\u22122 )\n2\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\n= \u03c3(\u03a6) (2\u03c1a \u03c1I \u2212 oeIa )\n\n(3.1)\n(3.2)\n\nwith a reflection symmetric \u03c3(\u03a6) (see (2.9). Here and in what follows\n\u03c1a = \u2202a \u03c1 and \u03c1I = \u03b7 IJ oeaJ \u03c1a .\n\n(3.3)\n\n\f7\nI\nTo appropriate leading orders, AIJ\na can be required to be compatible with ea on the time-like\nworld-tube \u03c4\u221e at spatial infinity which is part of the boundary \u2202M of M. This leads us to\nrequire that AIJ\na is of asymptotic order 3,\n\nA = oA(\u03a6) +\n\nA(\u03a6) 2A(\u03c6) 3A(\u03a6)\n+\n+\n+ o(\u03c1\u22123 )\n\u03c1\n\u03c12\n\u03c13\n\n1\n\n(3.4)\n\nCompatibility of A with e and flatness of oe enables us to set 0A = 1A = 0 and express 2A as\n2 IJ\nAa (\u03a6)\n\n= 2\u03c12 \u2202 [J \u03c1\u22121 1eI]\na\n\n\u0001\n\nJ]\n\u22121 o [I J]\n= 2\u03c1 2\u03c1[I \u03c1a \u2202 J] \u03c3 \u2212 oe[I\nea \u03c1 \u03c3\na\u2202 \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c1\n\n\u0001\n\n(3.5)\n\n(In spite of the explicit factors of \u03c1 the right side is in fact independent of \u03c1 because\n\u2202a \u03c3 \u223c \u03c1\u22121 \u00d7 (angular derivatives of \u03c3).) We will not need the corresponding expression of\n3\nA in terms of e and therefore demand compatibility between A and e only via (3.5).\nA.\n\nAction Principle\n\nConsider as before the 4-manifold M bounded by space-like surfaces M1 and M2 . We\nwill consider smooth histories (e, A) on M such that (e, A) are asymptotically flat in the\nsense specified above, and are such that M1 , M2 are Cauchy surfaces with respect to the\nspace-time metrics g defined by e, and the pull-back of A to M1 , M2 is determined by the\npull-back of e. The last condition is motivated by the fact that, since the compatibility\nbetween e and A is an equation of motion, boundary values where this compatibility is\nviolated are not of interest to the variational principle. Finally it is convenient to partially\nfix the internal gauge on the boundaries. We will fix a constant, time-like internal vector nI\nso that \u2202a nI = 0 and require that the histories be such that na := nI eaI is the unit normal\nto M1 and M2 .\nThe first order gravitational action on these histories is given by (see e.g. [26])\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\nIJ\nS(e, A) = \u2212\n\u03a3 \u2227 FIJ +\n\u03a3IJ \u2227 AIJ ,\n(3.6)\n2\u03ba M\n2\u03ba \u2202M\nwhere the 2-forms \u03a3IJ are constructed from the co-tetrads and F is the curvature A:\n\u03a3IJ :=\n\n1\n\u01eb\neK\n2 IJKL\n\n\u2227 eL\n\nand FI J = dAI J + AI K \u2227 AK J\n\n.\n\nAs in more familiar field theories, the action now depends only on the fundamental fields\nand their first derivatives. Although the connection A itself appears in the surface term\nat infinity, action is in fact gauge invariant. Indeed, it is not difficult to show that the\ncompatibility between the pull-backs to M1 and M2 of e and A and the property \u2202a nI = 0\nimplies that, on boundaries M1 and M2 , \u03a3IJ \u2227 AIJ = 2K\u01ebabc where K is the trace of the\nextrinsic curvature of M1 or M2 (see e.g., section 2.3.1 of [27]). Thus, on M1 and M2 , the\nsurface term in (3.6) is precisely the Gibbons-Hawking surface term with C = 0 in (1.1).\nTherefore, these surface contributions are clearly gauge invariant. This leaves us with just\nthe surface term at the time-like cylinder \u03c4\u221e at infinity. However, since e has to tend to\nthe fixed co-tetrad oe at infinity, permissible gauge transformations must tend to identity\n\n\f8\non \u03c4\u221e . Since the surface integral on \u03c4\u221e involves only the pull-back of A to \u03c4\u221e , it follows\nimmediately that this surface integral is also gauge invariant. Note incidentally that on \u03c4\u221e\nthis term is not equal to the Gibbons-Hawking surface term (because \u2202a \u03c1I falls off only\nas 1/\u03c1). Therefore, even if we were to assume compatibility between e and A everywhere\nand pass to a second order action, (3.6) would not reduce to the Gibbons-Hawking action\nwith C = 0. It is also inequivalent to the Gibbons-Hawking prescription of setting C = Ko\nbecause (3.6) is well-defined without reference to any embedding in flat space.\nOur boundary conditions allow us to rewrite this action as\nZ\n1\nS(e, A) =\nd\u03a3 \u2227 A \u2212 \u03a3 \u2227 A \u2227 A\n(3.7)\n2\u03ba M\nBoundary conditions also imply that the integrand falls off as \u03c1\u22124 . Since the volume element\non any Cauchy slice goes as \u03c12 sin \u03b8 d\u03c1d\u03b8d\u03c6, the action is manifestly finite even off shell if the\ntwo Cauchy surfaces M1 , M2 are asymptotically time-translated with respect to each other.\nSuch space-times M are referred to as cylindrical slabs. In this sub-section our discussion\nwill be restricted to such space-times.3\nOn the class of histories considered, it is easy to check that the functional derivatives\nof the action are well defined with respect to both e and A. Variation with respect to the\nconnection yields D\u03a3 = 0. This condition implies that the connection D defined by A acts\non internal indices in the same way as the unique torsion-free connection \u2207 compatible with\nthe co-tetrad (which satisfies \u2207a eIb = 0). When this equation of motion is satisfied, the\ncurvature F is related to the Riemann curvature R of \u2207 by\nFab IJ = Rab cd eIc eJd .\nVarying the action with respect to eIa and taking into account the above relation between\ncurvatures, one obtains Einstein's equations Gab = 0. Inclusion of matter is straightforward\nbecause the standard matter actions contain only first derivatives of fundamental fields\nwithout any surface terms and the standard fall-off conditions on matter fields imply that\nthe matter action is finite on cylindrical slabs also off shell.\nB.\n\nCovariant Phase Space\n\nWe will now let M be R4 . The covariant phase space \u0393 will consist of smooth, asymptotically flat solutions (e, A) to field equations on M. Thus, in contrast to section III A, M\nis not restricted to be a cylindrical slab nor are the pull-backs of (e, A) fixed on any Cauchy\nsurfaces. Our task is to use the action (3.6) to define the symplectic structure \u03a9 on this \u0393.\nFollowing the standard procedure (see, e.g. [28]), let us perform second variations of the\naction to associate with each phase space point (e, A) and tangent vectors \u03b41 \u2261 (\u03b41 e, \u03b41 A)\n3\n\nIf the two Cauchy surfaces bounding M are asymptotically boosted with respect to one another, M is\ncalled a boosted slab. For a boosted slab there is no guarantee that the action would be finite off shell.\n(The situation is the same in Yang-Mills theory in Minkowski space.) However, when equations of motion\nare satisfied the action reduces just to the surface term which, because of our boundary conditions, is\nR\nproportional to \u03c4\u221e \u03c3d3 V . The asymptotic behavior in time of \u03c3 [23] implies that this integral is finite.\nThus the on shell result of [3, 18] is recovered in this first order framework.\n\n\f9\nand \u03b42 \u2261 (\u03b42 e, \u03b42 A) at that point, a 3-form J on M, called the symplectic current:\nJ(\u03b3; \u03b41 , \u03b42 ) = \u2212\n\n1\n[\u03b41 \u03a3IJ \u2227 \u03b42 AIJ \u2212 \u03b42 \u03a3IJ \u2227 \u03b41 AIJ ].\n2\u03ba\n\n(3.8)\n\nUsing the fact that the fields (e, A) satisfy the field equations and the tangent vectors \u03b41 , \u03b42\nsatisfy the linearized equations off (e, A), one can directly verify that J(\u03b3; \u03b41 , \u03b42 ) is closed\nas guaranteed by the general procedure involving second variations. Let us now consider a\nf of M bounded by two Cauchy surfaces M1 , M2 . These are allowed to be general\nportion M\nf may in particular be a cylindrical or a boosted slab in the sense of\nCauchy surfaces so M\nf bounded by compact portions M\u03031 , M\u03032 of\nsection III A. Consider now a region R\u0303 within M,\nM1 and M2 and a time-like cylinder \u03c4 joining \u2202 M\u03031 and \u2202 M\u03032 . Since dJ = 0, integrating it\nover R\u0303 one obtains\nZ\nZ\nZ\nJ+\nJ+ J =0\n(3.9)\nM\u03031\n\nM\u03032\n\n\u03c4\n\nThe idea is to take the limit as \u03c4 expands to the cylinder \u03c4\u221e at infinity. Suppose the first\ntwo integrals continue to exist in this limit and the third integral goes to zero. Then, in the\nlimit the sum of the first two\nR terms would vanish and, taking into account orientation signs,\nwe would conclude that M J is a 2-form on \u0393 which is independent of the choice of the\nCauchy surface M. This would be the desired pre-symplectic structure. However, the issue\nof whether the boundary conditions ensure that the integrals over Cauchy surfaces converge\nand the flux across \u03c4\u221e vanishes is somewhat delicate and often overlooked in the literature.4\nIf either of these properties failed, we would not obtain a well-defined symplectic structure\non \u0393.\nLet us first consider the integral over the time-like boundary \u03c4 . As \u03c4 tends to \u03c4\u221e , the\nintegrand Jabc \u01ebabc tends to\n\u0012 1 \u0013 \u0012 2 \u0013\n\u03a3ab\nAc\n1 L\n2 IJ\n\u22123 abc\n\u03b4[1\nlim\n\u2227 \u03b42] 2 \u01ebabc = lim \u01ebIJKL oeK\n\u01eb\n(3.10)\na (\u03b4[1 eb ) (\u03b42] Ac ) \u03c1\n\u03c4 \u2192\u03c4\u221e\n\u03c4 \u2192\u03c4\u221e\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\nwhere \u01ebabc is the metric compatible 3-form on \u03c4 . Since the volume element on \u03c4 goes as\n\u03c13 , the integral of the symplectic flux over \u03c4 has a well-defined limit. But the key question\nis if the limit is zero. If not, there would be a leakage of the current J at spatial infinity\nand the symplectic structure would not be well-defined. Let us evaluate this term using the\nexpressions (3.2) and (3.5) of 1e and 2A. Then the second term in (3.10) reduces to\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u01ebIJKL oeK\n2\u03c1b \u03c1L \u2212 oeLb \u03b41 \u03c3 2\u03c1I \u03c1c \u2202 J \u03b42 \u03c3 \u2212 oeIc \u2202 J \u03b42 \u03c3 \u2212 oeIc \u03c1J \u03b42 \u03c3 \u03c1\u22123 \u01ebabc \u2212 1 \u2194 2 (3.11)\na\nThe term containing \u03b41 \u03c3\u03b42 \u03c3 vanishes because of anti-symmetrization while the remaining\nterms containing derivatives of \u03b42 \u03c3 vanish because the normal \u03c1c to \u03c4 is contracted either\n4\n\nFurthermore, even when such issues are discussed, one often considers only the restricted action \u03a9(\u03b4, \u03b4V )\nof the pre-symplectic structure \u03a9, where one of the tangent vectors, \u03b4V , is associated with an asymptotic\nsymmetry V a on M in the sense discussed in section IV because, as we will see, it is this restricted action\nthat directly enters the discussion of conserved quantities. Typically the 3-forms \u03a9(\u03b41 , \u03b4V ) on M have a\nbetter asymptotic behavior that the generic 3-forms \u03a9(\u03b41 , \u03b42 ). However, unless \u03a9(\u03b41 , \u03b42 ) is well-defined for\nall \u03b41 , \u03b42 , one does not have a coherent Hamiltonian framework and cannot start constructing conserved\nquantities.\n\n\f10\nwith \u01ebabc or the derivative of \u03c3. Thus, our boundary conditions imply that the symplectic\nflux across \u03c4\u221e vanishes.\nThe next question is whether the integral over M\u03031 (and M\u03032 ) continues to be well-defined\nin the limit as we approach M1 (resp. M2 ). The leading term is again given by the integral\nof (3.10) over M1 , the only difference being that \u01ebabc is now the metric compatible 3-form\non M1 . Since the volume element on M1 goes as \u03c12 d\u03c1d2 \u03a6, power counting argument says\nthat the integral of this leading term can be logarithmically divergent. However, one can\nagain expand out the leading term as (3.11) and show that it in fact vanishes. Since the\nremaining integrand falls off at least as fast as 1/\u03c14 , the integral over M converges. Thus,\nbecause of our boundary conditions, we are led to a well-defined pre-symplectic structure,\ni.e., a closed 2-form, on \u0393\nZ\n1\n\u03a9(\u03b41 , \u03b42 ) =\nTr [\u03b41 \u03a3 \u2227 \u03b42 A \u2212 \u03b42 \u03a3 \u2227 \u03b41 A] ,\n(3.12)\n2\u03ba M\nwhere M is any Cauchy surface in M and trace is taken over the internal indices. \u03a9 is\nnot a symplectic structure because it is degenerate. The vectors in its kernel represent\ninfinitesimal 'gauge transformations'. The physical phase space is obtained by quotienting\n\u0393 by gauge transformations and inherits a true symplectic structure from \u03a9. We will not\ncarry out the quotient however because the calculation of Hamiltonians can be carried out\ndirectly on (\u0393, \u03a9).\nIV.\n\nGENERATORS OF ASYMPTOTIC POINCAR\u00c9 SYMMETRIES\n\nLet V a be a vector field on M representing an asymptotic Poincar\u00e9 symmetry, a Killing\nvector field of one of the flat metrics \u03b7ab in \u0393. Then at any point (e, A) of \u0393, the pair\n(LV e, LV A) of fields satisfies the linearized field equations, whence \u03b4V := (LV e, LV A) is\na vector field on \u0393. (In the definition of the Lie-derivative, internal indices are treated\nas scalars; thus LV eIa = V b \u2202b eIa + eIb \u2202a V b .) The question is whether \u03b4V is a phase space\nsymmetry, i.e., whether it satisfies L\u03b4V \u03a9 = 0.\nConsider the 1-form XV on \u0393 defined by\nXV (\u03b4) = \u03a9(\u03b4, \u03b4V ).\n\n(4.1)\n\nL\u03b4V \u03a9 = 0 on \u0393 if and only if XV is closed, i.e.,\nddXV = 0\nwhere dd denotes the exterior derivative on (the infinite dimensional) phase space \u0393. If this\nis the case then, up to an additive constant, the Hamiltonian is given by\nddHV = XV .\nThe constant is determined by requiring that all Hamiltonians generating asymptotic symmetries at the phase space point ( oe, A = 0) corresponding to Minkowski space-time must\nvanish. To calculate the right side of (4.1), it is useful to note the Cartan identities\nLV A = V * F + D(V * A) and LV \u03a3 = V * D\u03a3 + D(V * \u03a3) \u2212 [(V * A), \u03a3]\n\n(4.2)\n\n\f11\nUsing these, the field equations satisfied by (e, A) and the linearized field equations for \u03b4,\none obtains the required expression of XV :\nI\n1\nTr [(V * A)\u03b4\u03a3 \u2212 (V * \u03a3) \u2227 \u03b4A] .\n(4.3)\nXV (\u03b4) := \u03a9(\u03b4, \u03b4V ) = \u2212\n2\u03ba S\u221e\nNote that the expression involves integrals only over the 2-sphere boundary S\u221e of the Cauchy\nsurface M (i.e., the intersection of M with the hyperboloid H at infinity); there is no volume\nterm. This is a reflection of the fact that the theory is diffeomorphism invariant.\nA.\n\nEnergy-Momentum\n\nLet us begin by setting V a = T a , an infinitesimal asymptotic translation. Since \u03b4\u03a3 \u223c\n1/\u03c1, A \u223c 1/\u03c12 and since the area element of the 2-sphere S\u221e at infinity grows as \u03c12 , the\nfirst term on the right side of (4.3) vanishes in the limit and we are left with\nI\n1\nXT (\u03b4) := \u03a9(\u03b4, \u03b4T ) =\nTr[(T * \u03a3) \u2227 \u03b4A]\n(4.4)\n2\u03ba S\u221e\nwhich is manifestly well-defined. Inserting the asymptotic forms of the connection (3.5) and\ntetrad (3.1) we find:\nI\n2\nXT (\u03b4) =\n[(\u03c1a T a ) nb \u2202b \u03b4\u03c3 + \u03b4\u03c3 (na T a )]d2 So\n(4.5)\n\u03ba S\u221e\nwhere nb is the unit normal to the 2-sphere S\u221e within the hyperboloid H and d2 So is the\narea element of the unit 2-sphere. Since the only dynamical variable in the integrand is \u03c3, we\ncan pull the \u03b4 out of the integral and obtain the Hamiltonian HT generating the asymptotic\ntranslation T a :\nI\n2\nHT =\n[(\u03c1a T a ) nb \u2202b \u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3(na T a )]d2 So\n(4.6)\n\u03ba S\u221e\nHad we selected a translational Killing field T\u0304 a of another flat metric \u03b7\u0304ab in our phase space\n\u0393, we would have obtained the same answer because T\u0304 a \u2212 T a = o(\u03c1\u22121 ).\nTaking our transformation to be a unit time-translation which is asymptotically orthogonal to the Cauchy surface M under consideration (and hence to S\u221e ) we find the energy to\nbe:\nI\n2\nE=\n\u03c3 d2 So\n(4.7)\n\u03ba S\u221e\nSimilarly, if T a is a space-translation which is asymptotically tangential to M, we find\nI\n2\n~\n~\n(\u03c1a T a ) (nb Db \u03c3) d2 So\n(4.8)\nP *T =\n\u03ba S\u221e\nwhere D is the derivative operator on the unit hyperboloid (H, hab ). Note that \u03c1a T a are the\n'l = 1' spherical harmonics on S\u221e determined by translations T a .\nThus the energy momentum is determined directly by \u03c3. It follows from [10, 12, 13]\nthat \u03c3 satisfies the hyperbolic equation D a Da \u03c3 + 3\u03c3 = 0 on (H, hab ). Thus, its initial data\nconsists of the pair (\u03c3, \u03c3\u0307 = na Da \u03c3) on a 2-sphere cross-section of H. Energy is given by the\n\n\f12\n'Y00 ' component of the first piece of this data while the momentum by the 'Y1m ' components\nof the second piece. Finally, recall that the reflection through the origin of Minkowski space\ninduces an isometry on the unit hyperboloid. Therefore every solution \u03c3 to the hyperbolic\nequation can be decomposed into a part \u03c3(E) which is even under this reflection and a\npart \u03c3(O) which is odd. Each satisfies the hyperbolic equation separately. Our boundary\nconditions require that \u03c3 be even. However it is easy to verify that, even if this condition\nhad not been imposed, only the even part \u03c3(E) contributes non-trivially to the expressions\n(4.7) and (4.8) of energy and momentum.\nB.\n\nRelativistic Angular Momentum\n\nLet us now set V a = La , an infinitesimal asymptotic Lorentz symmetry. For definiteness,\nwe will assume that it is a Lorentz Killing field of \u03b7ab := \u03b7IJ oeIa oeJb so that it is tangential\nto the \u03c1 = const hyperboloids H. The question is whether the vector field \u03b4L on \u0393 is\nHamiltonian. Let us begin by examining the 1-form XL on \u0393. Using (4.3), we have:\nI\n1\nXL (\u03b4) := \u03a9(\u03b4, \u03b4L ) =\nTr [(L * A) \u03b4\u03a3 + (L * \u03a3) \u2227 \u03b4A]\n(4.9)\nlim\n2\u03ba \u03c1\u2192\u221e S\u03c1\nwhere S\u03c1 is the 2-sphere intersection of the \u03c1 = constant hyperboloid H\u03c1 with the Cauchy\nsurface M used to evaluate the symplectic structure. Now, as \u03c1 tends to infinity, \u03a3 has a\nwell-defined, non-zero limit, A \u223c \u03c1\u22122 , \u03b4A \u223c \u03c1\u22122 , \u03b4\u03a3 \u223c \u03c1\u22121 and L \u223c \u03c1. Therefore the second\nterm in (4.9) is potentially divergent. Using the asymptotic form (3.5) of \u03b4A, it follows that\nthe second term is proportional to\nI\n(\u03b4\u03c3 La na ) \u03c1\u22122 d2 S\n(4.10)\nlim\n\u03c1\u2192\u221e\n\nS\u03c1\n\nwhere na is the unit normal to S\u03c1 within the hyperboloid H\u03c1 (or equivalently, to the Cauchy\nsurface M) and d2 S is the volume element on S\u03c1 (which grows as \u03c12 ). If we were interested\nin the rotational sub-group of the Lorentz group adapted to M, the vector field La would\nbe tangential to M, whence this term would vanish.5 But for a boost, La is proportional to\nna whence the potential divergence survives. Recall, however, that our boundary conditions\nrequire that \u03c3 be invariant under reflection symmetry. For a Lorentz boost, on the other\nhand, La na is proportional to Y1m , and therefore odd, whence the integral vanishes. Thus,\nthanks to the parity condition on \u03c3, the 1-form XL is well-defined on \u0393.\nTo extract the Hamiltonian from XL , we need to pull \u03b4 out of the integral. This is possible\nbecause the reflection symmetry again implies that the potentially divergent contribution\nfrom 2 AIJ\na vanishes. Furthermore, using the asymptotic forms (3.1) and (3.5) it follows that\ncontributions from (L * 1 \u03a3) \u2227 \u03b4 2A and (L * 2A) \u2227 \u03b4 1 \u03a3 cancel each other. Consequently,\n5\n\nOne might first think that since the integral vanishes for all rotations, by changing the Lorentz frame\ndefining the rotation subgroup one would be able to show that the integral vanishes also for boosts. This\nturns out not to be correct. To handle Lorentz boosts one needs a genuinely stronger asymptotic condition.\nAs discussed below this is provided by the reflection symmetry of \u03c3 discussed in section II. This point is\noften not realized because much of the literature focuses only on rotational subgroups. See, e.g. [3, 18].\n\n\f13\nXL = ddHL where the Hamiltonian generating the Lorentz transformation La is given by\nI\n1\nTr (L\u0302 * o \u03a3) \u2227 3A ,\n(4.11)\nHL = \u2212\n2\u03ba S\u221e\nwhere L\u0302a = La /\u03c1 is the Lorentz Killing field on the unit hyperboloid (H, hab ). Note that in\ncontrast to the energy momentum, the angular momentum is not determined by the leading\norder deviation of (e, A) from the ground state ( oe, A = 0) but by sub-leading terms.\nV.\n\nRELATION TO THE SPI FRAMEWORK\n\nThe boundary conditions we imposed in section III to construct the Lagrangian and\nHamiltonian frameworks imply that the space-time admits a conformal completion with\nconformal factor \u03c9 = \u03c1\u22122 in which spatial infinity is represented by a single point io . The\nconformally rescaled metric \u011dab = \u03c9 2 gab can be shown to have the regularity needed in\nthe so-called Spi-framework6 [10, 12]. These conditions in turn imply that various physical\nfields admit a direction dependent limit as one approaches io in space-like directions and can\ntherefore be regarded as smooth fields on the unit hyperboloid Ho in the tangent space at io .\nThe boundary conditions we imposed have been shown to eliminate the logarithmic translations [11] and supertranslations [10, 12] also in the Spi-framework, reducing the asymptotic\ngroup to the Poincar\u00e9 group. Using field equations in the physical space-time, fields on Ho\nwere shown to satisfy certain equations and these were used to define Poincar\u00e9 momentum\nin terms of the asymptotic Weyl curvature. The asymptotic field equations made it evident that these quantities are conserved, i.e., are independent of the choice of the 2-sphere\ncross-section of Ho used in their evaluation.\nIn section IV, by contrast, we were led to the expressions of Poincar\u00e9 momenta using\nHamiltonian considerations and our final expressions are surface integrals involving asymptotic forms of triads and connections rather than the Weyl curvature. It is natural compare\nthe underlying assumptions and ask for the relation between these quantities and those\nobtained in the Spi framework.\nA.\n\nEnergy-momentum\n\nIn the Spi framework, the total energy momentum Pa is a 4-vector in the tangent space at\ni . Let T a be an asymptotic translation in the physical space-time. Then it defines a vector\nToa at io and corresponding component Toa Pa of the 4-momentum is given by [10, 12, 14]\nI\n1\na\nTo pa = \u2212\nEab T\u0302ob na d2 S .\n(5.1)\n\u03ba S\no\n\nHere, Eab is the 'electric part' of the asymptotic Weyl curvature, T\u0302oa = hab T b is the conformal\nKilling field on the unit hyperboloid (Ho , hab ) in the tangent space Tio , and S any 2-sphere\ncross section of Ho . In terms of the physical space-time fields used in this paper, Eab is\ngiven by Eab = 3Eab \u2261 lim\u03c1\u2192\u221e \u03c13 Cambn \u03c1m \u03c1n . Thus, as mentioned in section II, 3Eab is the\n6\n\nSpi stands for spatial infinity and rhymes with scri that represents null infinity.\n\n\f14\nleading order electric part of the asymptotic Weyl tensor, where the electric and magnetic\ndecomposition is carried out using a \u03c1 = const foliation.\nTo relate this Pa to that defined in section IV, let us recall that \u03c3 serves as a scalar\npotential of 3Eab :\n3\nEab = \u2212 (Da Db \u03c3 + \u03c3hab )\n(5.2)\nLet us choose S to be the intersection of Ho with a space-like plane in Tio and let T a be unit\nand orthogonal to this plane. The question then is whether Toa pa equals the energy (4.7)\ndefined in section IV using Hamiltonian considerations.\nThe trace-free property of 3Eab implies that \u03c3 satisfies the hyperbolic equation D a Da \u03c3 +\n3\u03c3 = 0 and it is straightforward to verity that, on the specific cross-section S of Ho we\nchose, Da T\u0302ob = 0. Therefore on this S, we have: Eab T\u0302oa nb = Eab T\u0302oa T\u0302ob = \u2212T\u0302oa Da T\u0302ob Db \u03c3 + \u03c3 =\n\u2212(\u2206 + 2)\u03c3, where \u2206 is the Laplacian on S. Hence, we have\nI\n2\na\nT Pa =\n\u03c3d2 S\n(5.3)\n\u03ba S\nwhich agrees with the expression (4.7) of energy obtained from Hamiltonian considerations.\nNext, let T a be a space-translation tangential to the 3-plane whose intersection with Ho\ndefined S. Then T\u0302oa nb hab = 0 and Da V a = 2V a \u03c1a on S where \u03c1a is the unit normal to Ho .\nUsing the fact that Da nb vanishes on S we obtain,\nI\n2\na\n(T\u0302oa \u03c1a ) (nb Db \u03c3) d2 S\n(5.4)\nT Pa =\n\u03ba S\nwhich agrees with the expression (4.8) of the 3-momentum obtained from Hamiltonian considerations.\nThus, the energy-momentum obtained using Hamiltonian considerations agrees with that\nobtained using just the asymptotic field equations in the io framework. A detailed examination shows that in both frameworks one can impose substantially weaker boundary conditions to arrive at this expression of energy-momentum. In particular, one only needs to\nrequire that e be of asymptotic order just 1 (rather than 2) and, furthermore, one can drop\nthe requirement that the 1/\u03c13 -part of the asymptotic Weyl curvature be pure electric and\nreflection symmetric, thereby allowing both logarithmic translations and super-translations.\nB.\n\nRelativistic Angular Momentum\n\nThe situation with angular momentum is more subtle. To define Lorentz angularmomentum one has to get rid of the super-translation ambiguity also in the Spi framework. Indeed, the procedure we followed in section II merely mimicked the Spi strategy of\nrequiring that the 1/\u03c13 contribution to the magnetic part Bab of the physical Weyl tensor\nshould vanish and then setting its tensor potential to zero. However, in striking contrast\nto what we found in the discussion of Hamiltonians HL in section IV B, the Spi angular\nmomentum is well-defined without having to require that \u03c3 be reflection symmetric. Indeed, the Spi expression is constructed directly from 4Bab -the 1/\u03c14 part of Bab - and this\nfield is insensitive to logarithmic translations [11]. Furthermore, as we will now show the\nfinal Spi-expression coincides with the expression (4.11) of HL we found in section IV B.\nWhy then was the parity condition essential in our derivation of (4.11)? It was necessary\n\n\f15\nbecause, in the Hamiltonian approach, not only should the expression of angular momentum\nbe well defined, but it should also be the generator of asymptotic Lorentz transformations.\nMore precisely, the parity condition is needed to show that the 1-form XL on the phase\nspace \u0393 is well-defined and exact, i.e., that the right side of (4.11) has the interpretation of\nHamiltonians generating Lorentz rotations on the gravitational phase space.\nIn the Spi framework angular momentum is constructed from the 1/\u03c14 part of the magnetic Weyl tensor\n4\nBab := lim \u03c14 \u22c6 Cambn \u03c1m \u03c1n\n(5.5)\n\u03c1\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere, as before, \u03c1m is the unit normal to the \u03c1 = const hyperboloids. Every Lorentz Killing\nfield L\u0302a on the unit hyperboloid is of the form L\u0302a = Foab \u03c1b where Foab is a constant skew\ntensor in Minkowski space (M, \u03b7) and therefore has a dual Lorentz Killing field defined by\n\u22c6 a\nL\u0302 = \u22c6 Foab \u03c1b . The angular momentum JL\u0302 associated with the Lorentz Killing field La is\ndefined as:\nI\n4 ab \u22c6\nJL\u0302 =\nB\nL\u0302a \u01ebbmn dS mn\n(5.6)\nS\n\nwhere as before S is any 2-sphere cross-section of Ho and \u01eb is the volume 3-form on the\nunit hyperboloid (Ho , hab ). To relate JL\u0302 with the Hamiltonian HL of (4.11), we first write\nthe Weyl tensor in (5.5) as Cabcd = Fab IJ ecI edJ and use the fact that Fab IJ is given by\nFab IJ = 2\u2202[a Ab] + [Aa , Ab ]IJ . Then, by using the asymptotic expansions (3.1) and (3.5), one\nobtains7 ,\nI\n1\nTr (L\u0302 * o \u03a3) \u2227 3A ,\nJL\u0302 = \u2212\n2\u03ba S\n= HL .\n(5.7)\nThus the angular momentum constructed from asymptotic field equations in the Spi framework agrees with that obtained in this paper from Hamiltonian considerations. It therefore\nalso follows that in an asymptotically flat axi-symmetric space-time HL reproduces the Komar integral if La is chosen to be the rotational Killing field, and in an asymptotically\nflat stationary space-time, it yields the same angular momentum dipole moment as that\nconstructed from the stationary Killing field [24].\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper we have shown that in the first order formalism based on co-triads and\nLorentz connections, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks can be constructed without having to introduce an infinite counter term subtraction in the action. However, since in\nfour space-time dimensions physical metrics approach the flat metric only as 1/\u03c1 at spatial\ninfinity, the obvious boundary conditions allow one to make supertranslations and logarithmic translations. The asymptotic symmetry group is then larger than the Poincar\u00e9 group.\nIf one is interested only in energy momentum, these ambiguities can be ignored because\none can still single out a well-defined 4-dimensional group of asymptotic translations. To\n7\n\nThe calculation is significantly simplified by noting that (3.1) and (3.4) imply that the 1/\u03c13 -part 3Bab of\nBab vanishes, whence one can retain just the 1/\u03c14 terms in the expression of 4Bab in terms of A.\n\n\f16\nhave a well-defined angular momentum, on the other hand, the obvious boundary conditions\nused in much of the older literature are too naive; they have to be carefully strengthened\nto reduce the asymptotic symmetry group to the Poincar\u00e9 group. When this is done, the\nHamiltonians generating asymptotic Poincar\u00e9 transformations provide us with expressions\nof energy-momentum and Lorentz angular momentum. These agree with the expressions\nobtained in the Spi framework based of asymptotic field equations [10, 12]. Therefore they\nalso agree with conserved quantities defined by other methods in restricted cases with exact\nsymmetries [24].\nFor simplicity, in this paper we focused on vacuum Einstein's equations. However, inclusion of standard matter -in particular, scalar, Maxwell and Yang-Mills fields- with\nstandard boundary conditions used in Minkowski space is straightforward. There are no\nsurface terms in the action associated with matter and the expressions of the Hamiltonians\ngenerating asymptotic Poincar\u00e9 transformations are formally the same as the ones we found.\nIn particular, the Hamiltonians consist entirely of 2-sphere surface integrals at spatial infinity and their integrands do not receive any explicit contributions from matter. Matter\nmakes its presence felt through constraint equations which, in response to matter, modify\nthe asymptotic gravitational fields. Finally, in higher dimensions, the asymptotic structure\nis considerably simpler because the physical metric approaches the flat metric as 1/\u03c12 or\nfaster. This issue is discussed in the accompanying paper [29].\nWe conclude with a comment. In non-commutative geometry, in place of Riemannian\ngeometry, one introduces a spectral triplet (A, H, D) consisting of a non-commutative C \u22c6\nalgebra A, a representation of it on a Hilbert space H and a Dirac operator D acting on\nH. A certain choice of the triplet is made to describe (a generalization of) the standard\nmodel of particle physics together with Einstein gravity. Rather general symmetry considerations then lead to a so-called 'spectral action' from which dynamics can be derived\n[19]. It has been known for some time that an asymptotic expansion of this action can be\nperformed to make contact with the low energy physics and the first terms reproduce the\nEinstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant. Recently it was realized [20] that the\nspectral action can be naturally extended to incorporate the presence of boundaries and the\nasymptotic expansion of the new action produces precisely the Einstein Hilbert action with\nthe Gibbons-Hawking counter term for C = 0 (see (1.1)). This is an exciting development.\nHowever, as the discussion of section I shows, in the asymptotically flat context this action\nhas severe limitations and the extension of the spectral action to incorporate the boundary\nterm [20] was motivated using precisely the Hamiltonian formulation in the asymptotically\nflat context. More generally, the non-commutative framework has been developed primarily\nfor the Riemannian signature and passage to the Lorentz signature is contemplated via a\nWick transform in the asymptotically flat context. Therefore asymptotic considerations of\n[3] and this paper are directly relevant to the spectral action approach. The natural question then is: Can the spectral action framework be further generalized so that the leading\nterms in the asymptotic expansion yields an action which is free from the drawbacks of\n(1.1)? The first order framework discussed in this paper presents a natural avenue for such\na generalization. Indeed, the gravitational sector of the non-commutative geometry requires\na spin-bundle -and hence a frame field e- as well a Dirac operator -i.e., a spin connection\nA. However, in the non-commutative framework the two are in essence compatible with one\nanother from the beginning. The question is whether one can extend the framework so that\nthey are independent to begin with and made compatible only by equations of motion. The\nspectral action in such a generalization could then descend to (3.6) upon a suitable asymp-\n\n\f17\ntotic expansion. Quite apart from this specific application, such a 'first order' framework in\nnon-commutative geometry appears also to lead to mathematical structures which are interesting in their own right, and could provide a technical bridge between non commutative\ngeometry and loop quantum gravity.\nAcknowledgment:\n\nWe would like to thank Don Marolf and Nigel Higson for stimulating discussions.
