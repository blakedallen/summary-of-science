It remains\nunsolved what exactly happens to the electronic structure when a small number of holes are introduced into the\nMott-insulating state, although it is intuitively expected\nthat such holes can move around and give rise to some\ncharge conductivity; indeed, cuprates show a metallic\ntransport behavior at moderate temperature upon slight\nhole doping.1 Recent progress in the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments2,3,4 has\nelucidated that an unusual electronic structure called\n\"Fermi arcs\" are formed in the Brillouin zone at the\nFermi energy (see Fig. 1) when the metallic transport\nemerges in the lightly hole-doped cuprates. For example, in La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 (LSCO) with x = 0.03, where a\nmetallic transport is observed down to \u223c70 K (see Fig.\n2), a well-defined quasiparticle-like peak is observed in\na limited loci in the Brillouin zone, which defines the\nFermi arc;2 intriguingly, these loci lie on the putative\nnon-interacting Fermi surface that would be realized in\nthe absence of strong correlations. Since the Fermi arc\nstarts and ends in the middle of the Brillouin zone, it\nis not straightforward to apply such basic notion as the\nLuttinger sum rule5 that holds in ordinary Fermi liquids.\nTherefore, the Fermi arc is a striking manifestation of\nthe new physics that stems from the strong electron cor-\n\n0.03\n0.05\n\n(m\n\nI.\n\nab\n\narXiv:0711.4213v1 [cond-mat.supr-con] 27 Nov 2007\n\nInstitute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Ibaraki, Osaka 567-0047, Japan\n(Dated: October 28, 2018)\n\n0.08\n\n1\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nFIG. 2: Temperature dependences of \u03c1ab of a series of highquality LSCO single crystals measured up to 400 K.

In\nthis article, I will try to make a case for the large Fermi\nsurface picture based on the Mott-limit argument. Note,\nhowever, that those two pictures both implicitly assume\nthat the system is uniform, and it will be a different story\nif the electrons develop a self-organized inhomogeneity in\nthe lightly hole-doped cuprates.14,15,16,17,18\n\nII.\n\nMOTT LIMIT AND kF l\n\nAn important principle for discussing whether a system\nshould be a metal or an insulator is the Mott limit (or\nMott-Ioffe-Regel limit),19 which is based on very simple\nphysics: For the metallic transport to be realized in a\ncrystalline system, the Bloch waves of the electrons near\nthe Fermi energy \u03b5F must be well-defined, which dictates\nthat their mean free path l must be longer than the wave\nlength \u03bbF (= 2\u03c0/kF ). This condition leads to the Mott\nlimit that is expressed as l & \u03bbF , which is equivalent\nto kF l & 2\u03c0. Since this argument is quite crude, it is\ncustomary to relax the condition a little and consider\nthe Mott limit to be given by\nkF l & 1.\n\n(1)\n\nA prominent difference between the small hole pocket\npicture and the large Fermi surface picture for the Fermi\narc is that the former gives a small kF , while the latter dictates that kF must be large, as shown in Fig. 3.\n(Note that, for the discussion of the charge transport by\nholes, kF should be measured from the top of the relevant band.) To examine the metallic transport in LSCO\nshown in Fig. 2, let us try to estimate the electron mean\nfree path l by using the simple Drude theory, which gives\nthe following expression for the resistivity:\n\u03c1=\n\nc0 m\u2217\n,\ne2 n2D \u03c4\n\n(2)\n\nwhere m\u2217 is the electron effective mass and \u03c4 is the relaxation time. Note that in the present case we consider a layered quasi-two-dimensional system with the\nlayer distance c0 , and the resistivity \u03c1 is measured in the\nthree-dimensional (3D) unit \u03a9cm. To calculate \u03c4 from\n\u03c1 we need the carrier density n2D , and we assert that\n\n0\n\nx = 0.05\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nFIG. 4: Temperature dependences of RH of high-quality\nLSCO single crystals in the lightly-doped regime (x = 0.01 \u2212\n0.05) measured up to 400 K. Note that RH is essentially T independent at moderate temperature, and its value agrees\nvery well with c0 /nnominal\ne (= a2 c0 /xe), suggesting that\n2D\nnominal\nis actually determining the\na small carrier density n2D\ntransport properties.\n\nit is the carrier density suggested by the Hall coefficient\nthat should be used for this calculation. This is because\nin the lightly hole-doped regime (0.01 \u2264 x \u2264 0.05), as\nwas demonstrated in Ref. 20, the Hall coefficient RH is\nnearly constant at moderate temperature (see Fig. 4)\nand its value agrees very well with c0 /nnominal\ne, where\n2D\n2\nnnominal\n=\nx/a\nand\na\n\u2243\n3.8\n\u00c5\nis\nthe\nin-plane\nlattice\n2D\nconstant. (It is shown in the next section that, based on\nthe Boltzmann theory, one should use the \"small\" n2D\nfor this calculation even within the large Fermi surface\npicture.)\nIn the small hole pocket picture,\none may use the\n\u221a\nconventional formula kF =\n2\u03c0n2D for the twodimensional (2D) system, which, together with l =\nvF \u03c4 = (~kF \u03c4 )/m\u2217 , leads to the simple, well-known formula\nkF l = (hc0 )/(e2 \u03c1).\n\n(3)\n\nIn the most extreme case of x = 0.01, \u03c1ab at 300 K is 20\nm\u03a9cm (see Fig. 2), which gives kF l \u2243 0.1 according to\nEq. (3). Obviously, the Mott limit Eq. (1) is strongly\nviolated in this picture.\nOn the other hand, in the large Fermi surface picture,\none may use the value kF \u2243 0.6 \u00c5\u22121 suggested by the\nARPES data.2 One may also adopt the vF value from\nARPES experiments which found universal vF of \u223c1.5\neV\u00c5 that is nearly independent of doping.3 Together with\nthe estimate m\u2217 \u2243 3me (me is the free electron mass)\nbased on optical conductivity studies,21 in this picture\n\u03c1ab (300 K) of 20 m\u03a9cm would lead to \u03c4 \u2243 5 fs, which\n\n\f3\ngives l \u2243 10 \u00c5 and kF l \u2243 6. This satisfies the Mott\nlimit and, hence, the metallic transport in the lightly\nhole-doped regime is naturally understood. Therefore,\nthe fact that a metallic transport is realized at moderate\ntemperature even at x = 0.01 points to the conclusion\nthat the large Fermi surface picture is the more appropriate one, while the small hole pocket picture bears a\nparadox.\nIII.\n\nFERMI ARCS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF\nTHE BOLTZMANN THEORY\n\nLet us now discuss how the Boltzmann transport\ntheory22 should be applied to the system that has Fermi\narcs instead of an ordinary Fermi surface. First, one\nshould remember that in the Boltzmann theory the\ncharge current J is calculated as\nZ\nevk gk d3 k,\n(4)\nJ=2\nall k states\n\nwhere gk \u2261 fk \u2212 fk0 is the deviation of the distribution\nfunction fk from its equilibrium fk0 . When gk is caused\nby the action of an electric field E, in the relaxation time\napproximation J can be written as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n\u2202fk0 dS\n2\nJ =\nd\u03b5 (5)\ne \u03c4k vk (vk * E) \u2212\n4\u03c0 3\n\u2202\u03b5 ~vk\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\ne2\nvk\n=\n* E dSF .\n(6)\n\u03c4k (\u03b5F )vk\n3\n4\u03c0 ~ FS\nvk\nIt should be noted that \u2202fk0 /\u2202\u03b5 in Eq. (5) is non-zero only\nnear the Fermi surface, and this is why the surface integral on the Fermi surface appears in Eq. (6). The special\ncare we take in the present calculation to accommodate\nthe Fermi arc picture is that we allow the relaxation time\n\u03c4k to vary over the Fermi surface.\nAssume that E is along the x axis. For a 2D system,\none obtains from Eq. (6) that\nZ\ne2\nJx =\n\u03c4k (\u03b5F )(vx2 Ex /v)dLF\n(7)\n4\u03c0 3 ~ FS\nZ\ne2\nv\nE\n\u03c4k (\u03b5F )dLF ,\n(8)\n=\nF x\n8\u03c0 3 ~\nFS\nwhere v = (vx2 + vy2 )1/2 and dLF is the line element of the\nFermi \"surface\" in the 2D Brillouin zone.\nAdopting the large Fermi surface picture implies that\none accepts the existence of an underlying large Fermi\nsurface, across which the occupation number of the electronic states changes from one to zero. In order to incorporate the Fermi arcs in the above framework of the\nBoltzmann theory, one may suppose that only on the\n\"arc\" portion of the underlying large Fermi surface, \u03c4k is\nlong enough (\u03c4k = \u03c4arc ) to allow well-defined quasiparticles. Furthermore, one may suppose \u03c4k = 0 elsewhere\non the underlying Fermi surface, which means that the\n\nly\n\nky\n\nlk ! vk\"k\nOng's\nl-curve\n\nkx\n\nlx\n\n\"k # 0\n\"k = 0\nFIG. 5: Schematic diagram of the Ong's \"l -curve\" (Ref. 25)\nto calculate the Hall conductivity of the Fermi arc system in\nthe framework of the Boltzmann theory. For simplicity, the\nunderlying 2D Fermi surface is pictured as a simple circle.\n\nstates outside the Fermi arcs are incoherent. It should\nbe remembered that upon performing the energy integral in Eq. (5) to derive Eq. (6), we relied on the fact\nthat \u2202fk0 /\u2202\u03b5 is non-zero only near the Fermi surface; the\nproperty \u2202fk0 /\u2202\u03b5 6= 0 still holds at the underlying Fermi\nsurface even when there are no well-defined quasiparticles on it (such a surface is called \"Luttinger surface\" in\nthe recent literature23,24 ), so Eq. (8) is still valid in this\npicture.\nWith the above modeling of the Fermi arcs, one obtains\nthe conductivity on the Fermi arc as\nZ\ne2\n\u03c3xarc =\nv\n\u03c4k (\u03b5F )dLF\n(9)\nF\n8\u03c0 3 ~\nFS\ne2\nvF \u03c4arc * Larc ,\n(10)\n=\n8\u03c0 3 ~\nwhere Larc is the total length of the Fermi arcs. If the\nlarge Fermi surface is recovered (i.e., the arcs touch the\nBrillouin zone boundary), the conductivity \u03c3xfull would be\nwritten as \u03c3xfull = (e2 /8\u03c0 3 ~)vF \u03c4arc * Lfull (Lfull is the total\nlength of the underlying Fermi surface), so the conductivity of the Fermi arc system can be expressed as\n\u03c3xarc = p\u03c3xfull ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere p \u2261 Larc /Lfull. Since the ARPES data suggests\nthat p increases linearly with doping in the lightly-doped\nregime,3 Eq. (11) allows us to understand why the\n\"small\" n2D determines the conductivity even when the\nunderlying Fermi surface, and hence kF , is large. Quantitatively, the total length of the actual Fermi arcs observed\nin the lightly-doped LSCO is about a factor of three too\nlong3 to explain the measured \u03c1ab with the above simple\nformalism, which indicates that a more elaborate modeling of the Fermi arcs, such as a k dependence of \u03c4arc , is\nnecessary for a more quantitative description; nevertheless, the present model allows an intuitive understanding\nof the transport involving the Fermi arcs in the framework of the conventional Boltzmann theory.\nAs for the Hall conductivity \u03c3xy , the same modeling of\nthe Fermi arcs leads to a simple result. For 2D metals,\n\u03c3xy is most conveniently calculated by using the geometrical interpretation where \u03c3xy is given by the \"Stokes\narea\" traced out by the l k vector which defines the Ong's\n\n\f4\n\"l -curve\".25 Since l k = vk \u03c4k , the l k vector is non-zero\nonly for those k's that are within the Fermi arcs (Fig. 5),\nand in the simplest case of a circular underlying Fermi\nsurface and constant \u03c4k on the Fermi arcs, one obtains\narc\nfull\n\u03c3xy\n= p\u03c3xy\n. In this case, the Hall coefficient can be\nwritten as\narc\nRH\n=\n\narc\n\u03c3xy\nfull\n= RH\n/p.\n(\u03c3xarc )2\n\n(12)\n\nThis essentially explains why the Fermi arcs can give\nrise to a Hall constant that reflects the \"small\" n2D . Of\ncourse, for a really quantitative understanding, one needs\na more elaborate modeling of the Fermi arcs.\nIV.\n\nINSULATING BEHAVIOR\n\nIt is prudent to mention that the strong localization\n(or insulating) behavior is observed at low temperature in\nthe lightly-doped regime. While at first sight it appears\nnatural for the strong localization to occur when there\nare only a small number of carriers, when one calculates\nthe kF l value at the onset of the localization, one finds it\nunusually large. For example, at x = 0.05, \u03c1ab (T ) shows\nstrong localization below 50 K, where \u03c1ab = 0.9 m\u03a9cm\n(see Fig. 2) and the corresponding kF l value is as large as\n13. This is very unusual, because the strong localization\nis observed only when kF l < 1 in ordinary materials.19\nSuch an unusual nature of the localization in the\nlightly-doped regime is obviously related to the log(1/T )\ninsulating behavior that shows up when the superconductivity is suppressed by high magnetic fields in underdoped LSCO,26,27 because the kF l value estimated by\nusing Eq. (3) at the onset of the insulating behavior was\nas large as 13 for x = 0.15.27 It is intriguing that the\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n10\n\nlog(1/T ) insulating behavior in LSCO has been observed\nfor x \u2264 0.15,27 which exactly matches the doping range\nwhere the Fermi arcs are observed by ARPES.3 This coincidence may imply that the Fermi arcs are inherently\ninsulating at T = 0 in the absence of superconductivity,28\nand the physical origin of the \"insulating\" behavior at\nlarge kF l values is an important remaining question.\n\ny \u0307ando@sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp\nY.

Also, it is shown that the\ncharge transport involving the Fermi arcs with large underlying Fermi surface can be understood in the framework of the conventional Boltzmann theory, by simply\nassuming that only on the Fermi arcs the quasiparticle\nlifetime is finite; furthermore, the proposed model allows\nus to intuitively understand why the \"small\" carrier density determines the transport properties even when kF is\nlarge.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI would like to acknowledge helpful discussions with A.\nFujimori, S.
