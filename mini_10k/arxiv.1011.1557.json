M. VERNIKOV\nAbstract. Let M be a commutative monoid. We construct a first-order\nformula that defines the variety generated by M in the lattice of all commutative semigroup varieties.\n\nA subset A of a lattice hL; \u2228, \u2227i is called definable in L if there exists a firstorder formula \u03a6(x) with one free variable x in the language of lattice operations\n\u2228 and \u2227 which defines A in L. This means that, for an element a \u2208 L, the\nsentence \u03a6(a) is true if and only if a \u2208 A. If A consists of a single element, we\nspeak about definability of this element.\nWe denote the lattice of all commutative semigroup varieties by Com. A\nset of commutative semigroup varieties X (or a single commutative semigroup\nvariety X ) is said to be definable if it is definable in Com. In this situation\nwe will say that the corresponding first-order formula defines the set X or the\nvariety X .\nLet M be a commutative monoid. In [10, Corollary 4.8], we provide an explicit first-order formula that defines the variety generated by M in the lattice\nof all semigroup varieties. The objective of this note is to modify the arguments from [10] in order to present an explicit formula that defines the variety\ngenerated by M in the lattice Com.\nWe will denote the conjunction by & rather than \u2227 because the latter symbol\nstands for the meet in a lattice. Since the disjunction and the join in a lattice\nare denoted usually by the same symbol \u2228, we use this symbol for the join and\ndenote the disjunction by or. Evidently, the relations \u2264, \u2265, < and > in a\nlattice L can be expressed in terms of, say, meet operation \u2227 in L. So, we will\nfreely use these four relations in formulas. Let \u03a6(x) be a first-order formula.\nFor the sake of brevity, we put\n\b\n\u0001\nminx \u03a6(x) \u21cb \u03a6(x) & (\u2200y) y < x \u2212\u2192 \u00ac\u03a6(y) .\n\b\nClearly, the formula minx \u03a6(x) defines the set of all minimal elements of the\nset defined by the formula \u03a6(x).\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

M. VERNIKOV\n\nMany important sets of semigroup varieties admit a characterization in the\nlanguage of atoms of the lattice Com. The set of all atoms of a lattice L with\n0 is defined by the formula\n\u0001\nA(x) \u21cb (\u2203y) (\u2200z) (y \u2264 z) & minx {x 6= y} .\nA description of all atoms of the lattice Com directly follows from the wellknown description of atoms of the lattice of all semigroup varieties (see [2, 8],\nfor instance). To list these varieties, we need some notation.\nBy var \u03a3 we denote the semigroup variety given by the identity system \u03a3. A\npair of identities wx = xw = w where the letter x does not occur in the word\nw is usually written as the symbolic identity w = 01. Let us fix notation for\nseveral semigroup varieties:\nAn = var {xn y = y, xy = yx} - the variety of Abelian groups\nwhose exponent divides n,\n2\n\nSL = var {x = x, xy = yx} - the variety of semilattices,\nZM = var {xy = 0} - the variety of null semigroups.\nLemma 1. The varieties Ap (where p is a prime number ), SL, ZM and only\nthey are atoms of the lattice Com.\n\u0003\nPut\n\u0001\nNeut(x) \u21cb (\u2200y, z) (x \u2228 y) \u2227 (y \u2228 z) \u2227 (z \u2228 x) = (x \u2227 y) \u2228 (y \u2227 z) \u2228 (z \u2227 x) .\nAn element x of a lattice L such that the sentence Neut(x) is true is called\nneutral. We denote by T the trivial semigroup variety.\nLemma 2 ([6, Theorem 1.2]). A commutative semigroup variety V is a neutral\nelement of the lattice Com if and only if either V = COM or V = M \u2228 N\nwhere M is one of the varieties T or SL, while the variety N satisfies the\nidentity x2 y = 0.\n\u0003\nFor convenience of references, we formulate the following immediate consequence of Lemmas 1 and 2.\nCorollary 3. An atom of the lattice Com is a neutral element of this lattice\nif and only if it coincides with one of the varieties SL or ZM.\n\u0003\nA semigroup variety V is called chain if the subvariety lattice of V is a chain.\nClearly, each atom of Com is a chain variety. The set of all chain varieties is\ndefinable by the formula\nCh(x) \u21cb (\u2200y, z) (y \u2264 x & z \u2264 x \u2212\u2192 y \u2264 z or z \u2264 y).\nWe adopt the usual agreement that an adjective indicating a property shared\nby all semigroups of a given variety is applied to the variety itself; the expressions like \"group variety\", \"periodic variety\", \"nil-variety\" etc. are understood\nin this sense.\n1This notation is justified because a semigroup with such identities has a zero element and\nall values of the word w in this semigroup are equal to zero.\n\n\fDEFINABILITY OF A VARIETY GENERATED BY A COMMUTATIVE MONOID\n\n3\n\nPut\nNk = var {x2 = x1 x2 * * * xk = 0, xy = yx} (k is a natural number),\nN\u03c9 = var {x2 = 0, xy = yx},\nN3c = var {xyz = 0, xy = yx}\n(in particular N1 = T and N2 = ZM). The lattice of all Abelian periodic group\nvarieties is evidently isomorphic to the lattice of natural numbers ordered by\ndivisibility. This readily implies that non-trivial chain Abelian group varieties\nare varieties Apk with prime p and natural k, and only they. Combining this\nobservation with results of [9], we have the following\nLemma 4. The varieties Apk with prime p and natural k, SL, Nk , N\u03c9 , N3c\nand only they are chain varieties of commutative semigroups.\n\u0003\nFig. 1 shows the relative location of chain varieties in the lattice Com.\nN\u03c9\ns\n\n3k\n\ns Apk\n\nsNk\n\nA8 s\n\ns A27\n\ns Ap3\n\nsN4\n\nA4 s\n\ns A9\n\ns Ap2\n\ns\n\nA2k s\n\nsA\n\nA2 sPPA3 s\u274d\n\nsN c\n3\n\nN3\n\nSL\ns\n\n\u270fsZM\n\u270f\u270f\n\u270f\n\u270f\u270f\n\u274d\u274d\nPP\n\u2745\n\u270f\u270f\nPP\n\u270f\n\u274d\n\u2745\nP\n\u274ds\u270f\u270f\nP\n\u2745\ns\n\nAp\u2745\nPP \u274d\u274d\nP\n\nT\nFigure 1. Chain varieties of commutative semigroups\nCombining above observations, it is easy to verify the following\nProposition 5. The set of varieties {Ap | p is a prime number} and the varieties SL and ZM are definable.\nProof. By Lemma 1, all varieties mentioned in the proposition are atoms of\nCom. By Corollary 3, the varieties SL and ZM are neutral elements in Com,\nwhile Ap is not. Fig. 1 shows that the varieties ZM and Ap are proper subvarieties of some chain varieties, while SL is not. Therefore the formulas\n\u0001\nSL(x) \u21cb A(x) & Neut(x) & (\u2200y) Ch(y) & x \u2264 y \u2212\u2192 x = y ,\n\u0001\nZM(x) \u21cb A(x) & Neut(x) & (\u2203y) Ch(y) & x < y\ndefine the varieties SL and ZM respectively, while the the formula\n\u0001\nGrA(x) \u21cb A(x) & \u00acNeut(x) & (\u2203y) Ch(y) & x < y\ndefine the set {Ap | p is a prime number}.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f4\n\nB. M. VERNIKOV\n\nNote that in fact each of the group atoms Ap is individually definable (see\nProposition 15 below). The definability of the varieties SL and ZM is mentioned in [4, Proposition 3.1] without any explicitly written formulas.\nRecall that a semigroup variety is called combinatorial if all its groups are\ntrivial.\nProposition 6. The sets of all Abelian periodic group varieties, all combinatorial commutative varieties and of all commutative nil-varieties of semigroups\nare definable.\nProof. It is well known that a commutative semigroup variety is an Abelian\nperiodic group variety [a combinatorial variety, a nil-variety] if and only if it\ndoes not contain the varieties SL and ZM [respectively, the varieties Ap for\nall prime p, any atoms except ZM]. Therefore, the sets of all Abelian periodic\ngroup varieties, all combinatorial commutative varieties and of all commutative\nnil-varieties are definable by the formulas\n\u0001\nGr(x) \u21cb (\u2200y) A(y) & y \u2264 x \u2212\u2192 GrA(y) ;\n\u0001\nComb(x) \u21cb (\u2200y) A(y) & y \u2264 x \u2212\u2192 \u00acGrA(y) ;\n\u0001\nNil(x) \u21cb (\u2200y) A(y) & y \u2264 x \u2212\u2192 ZM(y)\nrespectively.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe claim that the set of all Abelian periodic group varieties is definable in\nCom is proved in [4] without any explicitly written formula defining this class.\nIdentities of the form w = 0 are called 0-reduced. We denote by COM the\nvariety of all commutative semigroups. A commutative semigroup variety is\ncalled 0-reduced in Com if it is given within COM by 0-reduced identities\nonly.\nProposition 7. The set of all 0-reduced in Com commutative semigroup varieties is definable.\nProof. Put\n\u0001\nLMod(x) \u21cb (\u2200y, z) x \u2264 y \u2212\u2192 x \u2228 (y \u2227 z) = y \u2227 (x \u2228 z) .\nAn element x of a lattice L such that the sentence LMod(x) is true is called\nlower-modular. Lower-modular elements of the lattice Com are completely\ndetermined in [7, Theorem 1.6]. This result immediately implies that a commutative nil-variety is lower-modular in Com if and only if it is 0-reduced in\nCom. Therefore the formula\n0-red(x) \u21cb Nil(x) & LMod(x)\ndefines the set of all 0-reduced in Com varieties.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following general fact will be used in what follows.\nLemma 8. If a countably infinite subset S of a lattice L is definable in L\nand forms a chain isomorphic to the chain of natural numbers under the order\nrelation in L then every member of this set is definable in L.\n\n\fDEFINABILITY OF A VARIETY GENERATED BY A COMMUTATIVE MONOID\n\n5\n\nProof. Let S = {sn | n \u2208 N}, s1 < s2 < * * * < sn < * * * and let \u03a6(x) be the\nformula defining S in L. We are going to prove the definability of the element\nsn for each n by induction on n. The induction\nbase is evident because the\n\b\nelement s1 is definable by the formula minx \u03a6(x) . Assume now that n > 1\nand the element sn\u22121 is definable by some formula \u03a8(x). Then the formula\n\b\n\u0001\nminx \u03a6(x) & (\u2203y) \u03a8(y) & y < x\ndefines the element sn .\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following lemma is a part of the semigroup folklore. It is known at least\nsince earlier 1980's (see [5], for instance). In any case, it immediately follows\nfrom Lemma 2 of [11] and the proof of Proposition 1 of the same article.\nLemma 9. If V is a commutative semigroup variety with V 6= COM then\nV = K \u2228 N where K is a variety generated by a monoid, while N is a nilvariety.\n\u0003\nLet Cm,1 denote the cyclic monoid ha | am = am+1 i and let Cm be the variety\ngenerated by Cm,1 . It is clear that\nCm = var {xm = xm+1 , xy = yx}.\nIn particular, C1,1 is the 2-element semilattice and C1 = SL. For notation\nconvenience we put also C0 = T . The following lemma can be easily extracted\nfrom the results of [3].\nLemma 10. If a periodic semigroup variety V is generated by a commutative\nmonoid then V = G \u2228 C m for some Abelian periodic group variety G and some\nm \u2265 0.\n\u0003\nLemmas 9 and 10 immediately imply\nCorollary 11. If V is a commutative combinatorial semigroup variety then\nV = C m \u2228 N for some m \u2265 0 and some nil-variety N .\n\u0003\nLet now V be a commutative semigroup variety with V 6= COM. Lemmas 9\nand 10 imply that V = G \u2228 C m \u2228 N for some Abelian periodic group variety G,\nsome m \u2265 0 and some commutative nil-variety N . Our aim now is to provide\nformulas defining the varieties G and Cm .\nIt is well known that each periodic semigroup variety X contains its greatest\nnil-subvariety. We denote this subvariety by Nil(X ). Put\nDm = Nil(Cm ) = var {xm = 0, xy = yx}\nfor every natural m. In particular, D1 = T and D2 = N\u03c9 .\nProposition 12. For each m \u2265 0, the variety Cm is definable.\nProof. First, we are going to verify that the formula\nAll-Cm (x) \u21cb Comb(x) & (\u2200y, z) Nil(y) & x = y \u2228 z \u2212\u2192 x = z\n\n\u0001\n\ndefines the set of varieties {Cm | m \u2265 0} in Com. Let V be a commutative semigroup variety such that the sentence All-Cm (V) is true. Then V is combinatorial.\nNow Corollary 11 successfully applies with the conclusion that M = C m \u2228 N for\n\n\f6\n\nB. M. VERNIKOV\n\nsome m \u2265 0 and some commutative nil-variety N . The fact that the sentence\nAll-Cm (V) is true shows that M = C m .\nLet now m \u2265 0. We aim to verify that the sentence All-Cm (Cm ) is true. It is\nevident that the variety Cm is combinatorial. Suppose that Cm = M \u2228 N where\nN is a nil-variety. It remains to check that N \u2286 M. We may assume without\nany loss that N = Nil(C m ) = Dm . It is clear that M is a commutative and\ncombinatorial variety. Corollary 11 implies that M = C r \u2228 N \u2032 for some r \u2265 0\nand some nil-variety N \u2032 . Then N \u2032 \u2286 Nil(C m ) = N , whence\nCm = M \u2228 N = C r \u2228 N \u2032 \u2228 N = C r \u2228 N .\nIt suffices to prove that N \u2286 C r because N \u2286 C r \u2228 N \u2032 = M in this case. The\nequality Cm = Cr \u2228 N implies that Cr \u2286 Cm , whence r \u2264 m. If r = m then\nN \u2286 C r , and we are done. Let now r < m. Then the variety Cm = Cr \u2228 N\nsatisfies the identity xr y m = xr+1 y m . Recall that the variety Cm is generated\nby a monoid. Substituting 1 for y in this identity, we obtain that Cm satisfies\nthe identity xr = xr+1 . Therefore Cm \u2286 Cr contradicting the unequality r < m.\nThus we have proved that the set of varieties {Cm | m \u2265 0} is definable by\nthe formula All-Cm (x). Now Lemma 8 successfully applies with the conclusion\nthat the variety Cm is definable for each m.\n\u0003\nProposition 13. For every natural number m, the variety Dm is definable.\nProof. Every commutative semigroup variety either coincides with COM or is\nperiodic. Thus the formula\nPer(x) \u21cb (\u2203y) (x < y)\ndefines the set of all periodic commutative varieties. In particular, if X is a\ncommutative variety such that the sentence Per(X ) is true then the variety\nNil(X ) there exists. Put\n\u0001\nNil-part(x, y) \u21cb Per(x) & y \u2264 x & Nil(y) & (\u2200z) z \u2264 x & Nil(z) \u2212\u2192 z \u2264 y .\nClearly, if X and Y are commutative semigroup varieties then the sentence\nNil-part(X , Y ) is true if and only if X is periodic and Y = Nil(X ). Let Cm be\nthe formula defining the variety Cm . The variety Dm is defined by the formula\n\u0001\nDm (x) \u21cb (\u2203y) Cm (y) & Nil-part(y, x)\nbecause Dm = Nil(Cm ).\n\n\u0003\n\nIf X is a commutative nil-variety of semigroups then we denote by ZR(X ) the\nleast 0-reduced in Com variety that contains X . Clearly, the variety ZR(X ) is\ngiven within COM by all 0-reduced identities that hold in X . If u is a word\nand x is a letter then c(u) denotes the set of all letters occurring in u, while\nlx (u) stands for the number of occurrences of x in u.\nLemma 14. Let m and n be natural numbers with m > 2 and n > 1. The\nfollowing are equivalent:\n(i) Nil(An \u2228 X ) = ZR(X ) for any variety X \u2286 D m ;\n(ii) n \u2265 m \u2212 1.\n\n\fDEFINABILITY OF A VARIETY GENERATED BY A COMMUTATIVE MONOID\n\n7\n\nProof. (i)\u2212\u2192(ii) Suppose that n < m \u2212 1. Let X be the subvariety of Dm given\nwithin Dm by the identity\n(1)\n\nxn+1 y = xy n+1 .\n\nSince n+1 < m, the variety X is not 0-reduced in Com. Note that X \u2286 Nil(An \u2228\nX ) because X is a nil-variety. The identity (1) holds in the variety An \u2228 X ,\nand therefore in the variety Nil(An \u2228 X ). But the latter variety does not satisfy\nthe identity xn+1 y = 0 because this identity fails in X . We see that the variety\nNil(An \u2228 X ) is not 0-reduced in Com. Since the variety ZR(X ) is 0-reduced in\nCom, we are done.\n(ii)\u2212\u2192(i) Let n \u2265 m \u2212 1 and X \u2286 Dm . One can verify that An \u2228 X = An \u2228\nZR(X ). Note that this equality immediately follows from [6, Lemma 2.5] whenever n \u2265 m. We reproduce here the corresponding arguments for the sake of\ncompleteness. It suffices to check that An \u2228 ZR(X ) \u2286 An \u2228 X because the opposite inclusion is evident. Suppose that the variety An \u2228 X satisfies an identity\nu = v. We need to prove that this identity holds in An \u2228 ZR(X ). Since u = v\nholds in An , we have lx (u) \u2261 lx (v)(mod n) for any letter x. If lx (u) = lx (v)\nfor all letters x then u = v holds in An \u2228 ZR(X ) because this variety is commutative. Therefore we may assume that lx (u) 6= lx (v) for some letter x. Then\neither lx (u) \u2265 n or lx (v) \u2265 n. We may assume without any loss that lx (u) \u2265 n.\nSuppose that n \u2265 m. Then the identity u = 0 holds in the variety Dm ,\nwhence it holds in X . This implies that v = 0 holds in X too. Therefore the\nvariety ZR(X ) satisfies the identities u = 0 = v. Since the identity u = v holds\nin An , it holds in An \u2228 ZR(X ), and we are done.\nIt remains to consider the case n = m \u2212 1. Let x be a letter with x \u2208\nc(u) \u222a c(v) and lx (u) 6= lx (v). If either lx (u) \u2265 m or lx (v) \u2265 m, we go to\nthe situation considered in the previous paragraph. Let now lx (u), lx (v) < m.\nSince lx (u) \u2265 n = m \u2212 1, lx (u) \u2261 lx (v)(mod n) and lx (u) 6= lx (v), we have\nlx (u) = n = m \u2212 1 and lx (v) = 0. The latter equality means that x \u2208\n/ c(v).\nSubstituting 0 for x in u = v, we obtain that the variety X satisfies the identity\nv = 0. We go to the situation considered in the previous paragraph again.\nWe have proved that An \u2228X = An \u2228ZR(X ). Therefore ZR(X ) \u2286 Nil(An \u2228X ).\nIf the variety X satisfies an identity u = 0 then un+1 = u holds in An \u2228 X . This\nreadily implies that u = 0 in Nil(An \u2228 X ). Hence Nil(An \u2228 X ) \u2286 ZR(X ). Thus\nNil(An \u2228 X ) = ZR(X ).\n\u0003\nNow we are well prepared to prove the following\nProposition 15. An arbitrary Abelian periodic group variety is definable.\nProof. Abelian periodic group varieties are exhausted by the trivial variety and\nthe varieties An with n > 1. The trivial variety is obviously definable. For\nbrevity, put\n\u0001\nZR(x, y) \u21cb 0-red(y) & x \u2264 y & (\u2200z) 0-red(z) & x \u2264 z \u2212\u2192 y \u2264 z .\nThe sentence ZR(X , Y) is true if and only if Y = ZR(X ). Let m be a natural\nnumber with m > 2. In view of Lemma 14, the formula\n\u0001\nA\u2265m\u22121 (x) \u21cb Gr(x) & (\u2200y, z, t) Dm (y) & z \u2264 y & Nil-part(x \u2228 z, t) \u2212\u2192 ZR(z, t)\n\n\f8\n\nB. M. VERNIKOV\n\ndefines the set of varieties {An | n \u2265 m \u2212 1}. Therefore the formula\nAn (x) \u21cb A\u2265n (x) & \u00acA\u2265n+1 (x)\ndefines the variety An .\n\n\u0003\n\nIt was proved in [4] that each Abelian group variety is definable in the lattice\nCom. However this paper contain no explicit first-order formula defining any\ngiven Abelian periodic group variety.\nNow we are ready to achieve the goal of this note.\nTheorem 16. A semigroup variety generated by a commutative monoid is definable.\nProof. Let V be a variety generated by some commutative monoid. According\nto Lemma 10, V = An \u2228 Cm for some n \u2265 1 and m \u2265 0. It is easy to check that\nthe parameters n and m in this decomposition are defined uniquely. Therefore\nthe formula\n\u0001\n(\u2203y, z) An (y) & Cm (z) & x = y \u2228 z\ndefines the variety V (we assume here that A1 is the evident formula defining\nthe variety A1 = T ).\n\u0003\nAcknowledgement.

M. VERNIKOV\nAbstract. Let M be a commutative monoid. We construct a first-order\nformula that defines the variety generated by M in the lattice of all commutative semigroup varieties.\n\nA subset A of a lattice hL; \u2228, \u2227i is called definable in L if there exists a firstorder formula \u03a6(x) with one free variable x in the language of lattice operations\n\u2228 and \u2227 which defines A in L. This means that, for an element a \u2208 L, the\nsentence \u03a6(a) is true if and only if a \u2208 A. If A consists of a single element, we\nspeak about definability of this element.\nWe denote the lattice of all commutative semigroup varieties by Com. A\nset of commutative semigroup varieties X (or a single commutative semigroup\nvariety X ) is said to be definable if it is definable in Com. In this situation\nwe will say that the corresponding first-order formula defines the set X or the\nvariety X .\nLet M be a commutative monoid. In [10, Corollary 4.8], we provide an explicit first-order formula that defines the variety generated by M in the lattice\nof all semigroup varieties. The objective of this note is to modify the arguments from [10] in order to present an explicit formula that defines the variety\ngenerated by M in the lattice Com.\nWe will denote the conjunction by & rather than \u2227 because the latter symbol\nstands for the meet in a lattice. Since the disjunction and the join in a lattice\nare denoted usually by the same symbol \u2228, we use this symbol for the join and\ndenote the disjunction by or. Evidently, the relations \u2264, \u2265, < and > in a\nlattice L can be expressed in terms of, say, meet operation \u2227 in L. So, we will\nfreely use these four relations in formulas. Let \u03a6(x) be a first-order formula.\nFor the sake of brevity, we put\n\b\n\u0001\nminx \u03a6(x) \u21cb \u03a6(x) & (\u2200y) y < x \u2212\u2192 \u00ac\u03a6(y) .\n\b\nClearly, the formula minx \u03a6(x) defines the set of all minimal elements of the\nset defined by the formula \u03a6(x).\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

M. VERNIKOV\n\nMany important sets of semigroup varieties admit a characterization in the\nlanguage of atoms of the lattice Com. The set of all atoms of a lattice L with\n0 is defined by the formula\n\u0001\nA(x) \u21cb (\u2203y) (\u2200z) (y \u2264 z) & minx {x 6= y} .\nA description of all atoms of the lattice Com directly follows from the wellknown description of atoms of the lattice of all semigroup varieties (see [2, 8],\nfor instance). To list these varieties, we need some notation.\nBy var \u03a3 we denote the semigroup variety given by the identity system \u03a3. A\npair of identities wx = xw = w where the letter x does not occur in the word\nw is usually written as the symbolic identity w = 01. Let us fix notation for\nseveral semigroup varieties:\nAn = var {xn y = y, xy = yx} - the variety of Abelian groups\nwhose exponent divides n,\n2\n\nSL = var {x = x, xy = yx} - the variety of semilattices,\nZM = var {xy = 0} - the variety of null semigroups.\nLemma 1. The varieties Ap (where p is a prime number ), SL, ZM and only\nthey are atoms of the lattice Com.\n\u0003\nPut\n\u0001\nNeut(x) \u21cb (\u2200y, z) (x \u2228 y) \u2227 (y \u2228 z) \u2227 (z \u2228 x) = (x \u2227 y) \u2228 (y \u2227 z) \u2228 (z \u2227 x) .\nAn element x of a lattice L such that the sentence Neut(x) is true is called\nneutral. We denote by T the trivial semigroup variety.\nLemma 2 ([6, Theorem 1.2]). A commutative semigroup variety V is a neutral\nelement of the lattice Com if and only if either V = COM or V = M \u2228 N\nwhere M is one of the varieties T or SL, while the variety N satisfies the\nidentity x2 y = 0.\n\u0003\nFor convenience of references, we formulate the following immediate consequence of Lemmas 1 and 2.\nCorollary 3. An atom of the lattice Com is a neutral element of this lattice\nif and only if it coincides with one of the varieties SL or ZM.\n\u0003\nA semigroup variety V is called chain if the subvariety lattice of V is a chain.\nClearly, each atom of Com is a chain variety. The set of all chain varieties is\ndefinable by the formula\nCh(x) \u21cb (\u2200y, z) (y \u2264 x & z \u2264 x \u2212\u2192 y \u2264 z or z \u2264 y).\nWe adopt the usual agreement that an adjective indicating a property shared\nby all semigroups of a given variety is applied to the variety itself; the expressions like \"group variety\", \"periodic variety\", \"nil-variety\" etc. are understood\nin this sense.\n1This notation is justified because a semigroup with such identities has a zero element and\nall values of the word w in this semigroup are equal to zero.\n\n\fDEFINABILITY OF THE VARIETY GENERATED BY A COMMUTATIVE MONOID\n\n3\n\nPut\nNk = var {x2 = x1 x2 * * * xk = 0, xy = yx} (k is a natural number),\nN\u03c9 = var {x2 = 0, xy = yx},\nN3c = var {xyz = 0, xy = yx}\n(in particular N1 = T and N2 = ZM). The lattice of all Abelian periodic group\nvarieties is evidently isomorphic to the lattice of natural numbers ordered by\ndivisibility. This readily implies that non-trivial chain Abelian group varieties\nare varieties Apk with prime p and natural k, and only they. Combining this\nobservation with results of [9], we have the following\nLemma 4. The varieties Apk with prime p and natural k, SL, Nk , N\u03c9 , N3c\nand only they are chain varieties of commutative semigroups.\n\u0003\nFig. 1 shows the relative location of chain varieties in the lattice Com.\nN\u03c9\ns\n\n3k\n\ns Apk\n\nsNk\n\nA8 s\n\ns A27\n\ns Ap3\n\nsN4\n\nA4 s\n\ns A9\n\ns Ap2\n\ns\n\nA2k s\n\nsA\n\nA2 sPPA3 s\u274d\n\nsN c\n3\n\nN3\n\nSL\ns\n\n\u270fsZM\n\u270f\u270f\n\u270f\n\u270f\u270f\n\u274d\u274d\nPP\n\u2745\n\u270f\u270f\nPP\n\u270f\n\u274d\n\u2745\nP\n\u274ds\u270f\u270f\nP\n\u2745\ns\n\nAp\u2745\nPP \u274d\u274d\nP\n\nT\nFigure 1. Chain varieties of commutative semigroups\nCombining above observations, it is easy to verify the following\nProposition 5. The set of varieties {Ap | p is a prime number} and the varieties SL and ZM are definable.\nProof. By Lemma 1, all varieties mentioned in the proposition are atoms of\nCom. By Corollary 3, the varieties SL and ZM are neutral elements in Com,\nwhile Ap is not. Fig. 1 shows that the varieties ZM and Ap are proper subvarieties of some chain varieties, while SL is not. Therefore the formulas\n\u0001\nSL(x) \u21cb A(x) & Neut(x) & (\u2200y) Ch(y) & x \u2264 y \u2212\u2192 x = y ,\n\u0001\nZM(x) \u21cb A(x) & Neut(x) & (\u2203y) Ch(y) & x < y\ndefine the varieties SL and ZM respectively, while the the formula\n\u0001\nGrA(x) \u21cb A(x) & \u00acNeut(x) & (\u2203y) Ch(y) & x < y\ndefine the set {Ap | p is a prime number}.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f4\n\nB. M. VERNIKOV\n\nNote that in fact each of the group atoms Ap is individually definable (see\nProposition 15 below). The definability of the varieties SL and ZM is mentioned in [4, Proposition 3.1] without any explicitly written formulas.\nRecall that a semigroup variety is called combinatorial if all its groups are\ntrivial.\nProposition 6. The sets of all Abelian periodic group varieties, all combinatorial commutative varieties and of all commutative nil-varieties of semigroups\nare definable.\nProof. It is well known that a commutative semigroup variety is an Abelian\nperiodic group variety [a combinatorial variety, a nil-variety] if and only if it\ndoes not contain the varieties SL and ZM [respectively, the varieties Ap for\nall prime p, any atoms except ZM]. Therefore, the sets of all Abelian periodic\ngroup varieties, all combinatorial commutative varieties and of all commutative\nnil-varieties are definable by the formulas\n\u0001\nGr(x) \u21cb (\u2200y) A(y) & y \u2264 x \u2212\u2192 GrA(y) ;\n\u0001\nComb(x) \u21cb (\u2200y) A(y) & y \u2264 x \u2212\u2192 \u00acGrA(y) ;\n\u0001\nNil(x) \u21cb (\u2200y) A(y) & y \u2264 x \u2212\u2192 ZM(y)\nrespectively.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe claim that the set of all Abelian periodic group varieties is definable in\nCom is proved in [4] without any explicitly written formula defining this class.\nIdentities of the form w = 0 are called 0-reduced. We denote by COM the\nvariety of all commutative semigroups. A commutative semigroup variety is\ncalled 0-reduced in Com if it is given within COM by 0-reduced identities\nonly.\nProposition 7. The set of all 0-reduced in Com commutative semigroup varieties is definable.\nProof. Put\n\u0001\nLMod(x) \u21cb (\u2200y, z) x \u2264 y \u2212\u2192 x \u2228 (y \u2227 z) = y \u2227 (x \u2228 z) .\nAn element x of a lattice L such that the sentence LMod(x) is true is called\nlower-modular. Lower-modular elements of the lattice Com are completely\ndetermined in [7, Theorem 1.6]. This result immediately implies that a commutative nil-variety is lower-modular in Com if and only if it is 0-reduced in\nCom. Therefore the formula\n0-red(x) \u21cb Nil(x) & LMod(x)\ndefines the set of all 0-reduced in Com varieties.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following general fact will be used in what follows.\nLemma 8. If a countably infinite subset S of a lattice L is definable in L\nand forms a chain isomorphic to the chain of natural numbers under the order\nrelation in L then every member of this set is definable in L.\n\n\fDEFINABILITY OF THE VARIETY GENERATED BY A COMMUTATIVE MONOID\n\n5\n\nProof. Let S = {sn | n \u2208 N}, s1 < s2 < * * * < sn < * * * and let \u03a6(x) be the\nformula defining S in L. We are going to prove the definability of the element\nsn for each n by induction on n. The induction\nbase is evident because the\n\b\nelement s1 is definable by the formula minx \u03a6(x) . Assume now that n > 1\nand the element sn\u22121 is definable by some formula \u03a8(x). Then the formula\n\b\n\u0001\nminx \u03a6(x) & (\u2203y) \u03a8(y) & y < x\ndefines the element sn .\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following lemma is a part of the semigroup folklore. It is known at least\nsince earlier 1980's (see [5], for instance). In any case, it immediately follows\nfrom Lemma 2 of [11] and the proof of Proposition 1 of the same article.\nLemma 9. If V is a commutative semigroup variety with V 6= COM then\nV = K \u2228 N where K is a variety generated by a monoid, while N is a nilvariety.\n\u0003\nLet Cm,1 denote the cyclic monoid ha | am = am+1 i and let Cm be the variety\ngenerated by Cm,1 . It is clear that\nCm = var {xm = xm+1 , xy = yx}.\nIn particular, C1,1 is the 2-element semilattice and C1 = SL. For notation\nconvenience we put also C0 = T . The following lemma can be easily extracted\nfrom the results of [3].\nLemma 10. If a periodic semigroup variety V is generated by a commutative\nmonoid then V = G \u2228 C m for some Abelian periodic group variety G and some\nm \u2265 0.\n\u0003\nLemmas 9 and 10 immediately imply\nCorollary 11. If V is a commutative combinatorial semigroup variety then\nV = C m \u2228 N for some m \u2265 0 and some nil-variety N .\n\u0003\nLet now V be a commutative semigroup variety with V 6= COM. Lemmas 9\nand 10 imply that V = G \u2228 C m \u2228 N for some Abelian periodic group variety G,\nsome m \u2265 0 and some commutative nil-variety N . Our aim now is to provide\nformulas defining the varieties G and Cm .\nIt is well known that each periodic semigroup variety X contains its greatest\nnil-subvariety. We denote this subvariety by Nil(X ). Put\nDm = Nil(Cm ) = var {xm = 0, xy = yx}\nfor every natural m. In particular, D1 = T and D2 = N\u03c9 .\nProposition 12. For each m \u2265 0, the variety Cm is definable.\nProof. First, we are going to verify that the formula\nAll-Cm (x) \u21cb Comb(x) & (\u2200y, z) Nil(y) & x = y \u2228 z \u2212\u2192 x = z\n\n\u0001\n\ndefines the set of varieties {Cm | m \u2265 0} in Com. Let V be a commutative semigroup variety such that the sentence All-Cm (V) is true. Then V is combinatorial.\nNow Corollary 11 successfully applies with the conclusion that M = C m \u2228 N for\n\n\f6\n\nB. M. VERNIKOV\n\nsome m \u2265 0 and some commutative nil-variety N . The fact that the sentence\nAll-Cm (V) is true shows that M = C m .\nLet now m \u2265 0. We aim to verify that the sentence All-Cm (Cm ) is true. It is\nevident that the variety Cm is combinatorial. Suppose that Cm = M \u2228 N where\nN is a nil-variety. It remains to check that N \u2286 M. We may assume without\nany loss that N = Nil(C m ) = Dm . It is clear that M is a commutative and\ncombinatorial variety. Corollary 11 implies that M = C r \u2228 N \u2032 for some r \u2265 0\nand some nil-variety N \u2032 . Then N \u2032 \u2286 Nil(C m ) = N , whence\nCm = M \u2228 N = C r \u2228 N \u2032 \u2228 N = C r \u2228 N .\nIt suffices to prove that N \u2286 C r because N \u2286 C r \u2228 N \u2032 = M in this case. The\nequality Cm = Cr \u2228 N implies that Cr \u2286 Cm , whence r \u2264 m. If r = m then\nN \u2286 C r , and we are done. Let now r < m. Then the variety Cm = Cr \u2228 N\nsatisfies the identity xr y m = xr+1 y m . Recall that the variety Cm is generated\nby a monoid. Substituting 1 for y in this identity, we obtain that Cm satisfies\nthe identity xr = xr+1 . Therefore Cm \u2286 Cr contradicting the unequality r < m.\nThus we have proved that the set of varieties {Cm | m \u2265 0} is definable by\nthe formula All-Cm (x). Now Lemma 8 successfully applies with the conclusion\nthat the variety Cm is definable for each m.\n\u0003\nProposition 13. For every natural number m, the variety Dm is definable.\nProof. Every commutative semigroup variety either coincides with COM or is\nperiodic. Thus the formula\nPer(x) \u21cb (\u2203y) (x < y)\ndefines the set of all periodic commutative varieties. In particular, if X is a\ncommutative variety such that the sentence Per(X ) is true then the variety\nNil(X ) there exists. Put\n\u0001\nNil-part(x, y) \u21cb Per(x) & y \u2264 x & Nil(y) & (\u2200z) z \u2264 x & Nil(z) \u2212\u2192 z \u2264 y .\nClearly, if X and Y are commutative semigroup varieties then the sentence\nNil-part(X , Y ) is true if and only if X is periodic and Y = Nil(X ). Let Cm be\nthe formula defining the variety Cm . The variety Dm is defined by the formula\n\u0001\nDm (x) \u21cb (\u2203y) Cm (y) & Nil-part(y, x)\nbecause Dm = Nil(Cm ).\n\n\u0003\n\nIf X is a commutative nil-variety of semigroups then we denote by ZR(X ) the\nleast 0-reduced in Com variety that contains X . Clearly, the variety ZR(X ) is\ngiven within COM by all 0-reduced identities that hold in X . If u is a word\nand x is a letter then c(u) denotes the set of all letters occurring in u, while\nlx (u) stands for the number of occurrences of x in u.\nLemma 14. Let m and n be natural numbers with m > 2 and n > 1. The\nfollowing are equivalent:\n(i) Nil(An \u2228 X ) = ZR(X ) for any variety X \u2286 D m ;\n(ii) n \u2265 m \u2212 1.\n\n\fDEFINABILITY OF THE VARIETY GENERATED BY A COMMUTATIVE MONOID\n\n7\n\nProof. (i)\u2212\u2192(ii) Suppose that n < m \u2212 1. Let X be the subvariety of Dm given\nwithin Dm by the identity\n(1)\n\nxn+1 y = xy n+1 .\n\nSince n+1 < m, the variety X is not 0-reduced in Com. Note that X \u2286 Nil(An \u2228\nX ) because X is a nil-variety. The identity (1) holds in the variety An \u2228 X ,\nand therefore in the variety Nil(An \u2228 X ). But the latter variety does not satisfy\nthe identity xn+1 y = 0 because this identity fails in X . We see that the variety\nNil(An \u2228 X ) is not 0-reduced in Com. Since the variety ZR(X ) is 0-reduced in\nCom, we are done.\n(ii)\u2212\u2192(i) Let n \u2265 m \u2212 1 and X \u2286 Dm . One can verify that An \u2228 X = An \u2228\nZR(X ). Note that this equality immediately follows from [6, Lemma 2.5] whenever n \u2265 m. We reproduce here the corresponding arguments for the sake of\ncompleteness. It suffices to check that An \u2228 ZR(X ) \u2286 An \u2228 X because the opposite inclusion is evident. Suppose that the variety An \u2228 X satisfies an identity\nu = v. We need to prove that this identity holds in An \u2228 ZR(X ). Since u = v\nholds in An , we have lx (u) \u2261 lx (v)(mod n) for any letter x. If lx (u) = lx (v)\nfor all letters x then u = v holds in An \u2228 ZR(X ) because this variety is commutative. Therefore we may assume that lx (u) 6= lx (v) for some letter x. Then\neither lx (u) \u2265 n or lx (v) \u2265 n. We may assume without any loss that lx (u) \u2265 n.\nSuppose that n \u2265 m. Then the identity u = 0 holds in the variety Dm ,\nwhence it holds in X . This implies that v = 0 holds in X too. Therefore the\nvariety ZR(X ) satisfies the identities u = 0 = v. Since the identity u = v holds\nin An , it holds in An \u2228 ZR(X ), and we are done.\nIt remains to consider the case n = m \u2212 1. Let x be a letter with x \u2208\nc(u) \u222a c(v) and lx (u) 6= lx (v). If either lx (u) \u2265 m or lx (v) \u2265 m, we go to\nthe situation considered in the previous paragraph. Let now lx (u), lx (v) < m.\nSince lx (u) \u2265 n = m \u2212 1, lx (u) \u2261 lx (v)(mod n) and lx (u) 6= lx (v), we have\nlx (u) = n = m \u2212 1 and lx (v) = 0. The latter equality means that x \u2208\n/ c(v).\nSubstituting 0 for x in u = v, we obtain that the variety X satisfies the identity\nv = 0. We go to the situation considered in the previous paragraph again.\nWe have proved that An \u2228X = An \u2228ZR(X ). Therefore ZR(X ) \u2286 Nil(An \u2228X ).\nIf the variety X satisfies an identity u = 0 then un+1 = u holds in An \u2228 X . This\nreadily implies that u = 0 in Nil(An \u2228 X ). Hence Nil(An \u2228 X ) \u2286 ZR(X ). Thus\nNil(An \u2228 X ) = ZR(X ).\n\u0003\nNow we are well prepared to prove the following\nProposition 15. An arbitrary Abelian periodic group variety is definable.\nProof. Abelian periodic group varieties are exhausted by the trivial variety and\nthe varieties An with n > 1. The trivial variety is obviously definable. For\nbrevity, put\n\u0001\nZR(x, y) \u21cb 0-red(y) & x \u2264 y & (\u2200z) 0-red(z) & x \u2264 z \u2212\u2192 y \u2264 z .\nThe sentence ZR(X , Y) is true if and only if Y = ZR(X ). Let m be a natural\nnumber with m > 2. In view of Lemma 14, the formula\n\u0001\nA\u2265m\u22121 (x) \u21cb Gr(x) & (\u2200y, z, t) Dm (y) & z \u2264 y & Nil-part(x \u2228 z, t) \u2212\u2192 ZR(z, t)\n\n\f8\n\nB. M. VERNIKOV\n\ndefines the set of varieties {An | n \u2265 m \u2212 1}. Therefore the formula\nAn (x) \u21cb A\u2265n (x) & \u00acA\u2265n+1 (x)\ndefines the variety An .\n\n\u0003\n\nIt was proved in [4] that each Abelian group variety is definable in the lattice\nCom. However this paper contain no explicit first-order formula defining any\ngiven Abelian periodic group variety.\nNow we are ready to achieve the goal of this note.\nTheorem 16. A semigroup variety generated by a commutative monoid is definable.\nProof. Let V be a variety generated by some commutative monoid. According\nto Lemma 10, V = An \u2228 Cm for some n \u2265 1 and m \u2265 0. It is easy to check that\nthe parameters n and m in this decomposition are defined uniquely. Therefore\nthe formula\n\u0001\n(\u2203y, z) An (y) & Cm (z) & x = y \u2228 z\ndefines the variety V (we assume here that A1 is the evident formula defining\nthe variety A1 = T ).\n\u0003\nAcknowledgement.
