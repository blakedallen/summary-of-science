This is done by expanding the monoexciton states {|\u03a8(\u03bd) (X 0 )i} (\u03bd = 0, 1, 2, * * *) in a basis\nof Slater determinants (configurations) {|\u03a6(X 0 )i} constructed in the subspace of Ne and Mh electron and hole\nconfined single-particle levels, respectively:\n\n\f3\n\n|\u03a8(\u03bd) (X 0 )i =\n\nX\n\nC\u03ba(\u03bd) (X 0 ) |\u03a6\u03ba (X 0 )i,\n\n(3)\n\n\u03ba\n\n(\u03bd)\n\nwhere C\u03ba (X 0 ) are the CI coefficients and \u03ba is a composite index that labels each Slater determinant.

In contrast to the four levels comprising the\nmonoexciton, the biexciton XX 0 has a singly-degenerate,\nclosed-shell ground state (e20 h20 ) that is bright.

The brightdark splitting of the ground-state levels shown in Fig.\n1(a) is 84 \u03bceV. The magnitude of this splitting increases\nup to 178 \u03bceV for a 20 \u00c5-tall dot. At T \u223c 0 K only the\ndark states are populated, thus, the transition to the\nground state e00 h00 is long-lived. Figure 1(a) (shaded area)\nshows transitions \u03c920 and \u03c930 from the bright states to\ne00 h00 . The low-lying excited states of the monoexciton\ncorrespond to excitations of the hole, i.e. e10 h11 , e10 h12 and\ne10 h13 , due to the much smaller spacing of hole singleparticle energy levels compared to that of the electrons.\nThus, the spacing of the excited states fingerprint the\nhole energy level structure. Figure 1(a) shows the first\ntwelve excited states that are derived from e10 h11 , e10 h12\nand e10 h13 . Each of these states are four-fold degenerate\nand their fine structure is shown schematically. We find\nthat three out of the four levels that arise from e10 h12 are\noptically allowed. In particular, one of the levels, indicated as \u22a5, emits light that is polarized along [001], while\nthe remaining two emit in-plane polarized light. These\nexcited levels become optically forbidden as the dot becomes flatter.\n\n.\n\n\u01eb(R, R\u2032 )|R \u2212 R\u2032 |\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\narea] of the biexciton are fast (\u223c ns). The biexciton has a\nnon-trivial ladder of excited states that is determined primarily by the relative magnitude of the direct Coulomb\nhole-hole interaction and the single-particle energy splittings of the hole states. The ladder begins with states derived from e20 h10 h11 at about 6 meV above the ground state\nand follows with e20 h10 h12 and e20 h10 h13 at about 11 meV and\n16 meV, respectively. Due to the two-fold Kramers degeneracy of the hole levels, e20 h10 h11 is four-fold degenerate\nat the single-particle level, these states split into four distinct states due to hole-hole and electron-hole exchange\n[Fig 1(b)]. Similarly, the four states in e20 h10 h12 split in two\ngroups of two. In this case, remarkably, the splitting is\nabout twice as big as that in e20 h10 h11 and nearly five times\nbigger than in e20 h10 h13 (\u223c 500 \u03bceV). Similarly to the monoexciton case, the lowest split-off pair in e20 h10 h12 is optically active and emits light polarized along [001] [\u22a5, Fig.\n1(b)]. Further, these states become darker as the dot\nbecomes flatter, being forbidden at h = 20 \u00c5. The subsequent excited state in the ladder derives from the singlydegenerate closed-shell state e20 h21 and is closely-spaced\nwith e20 h10 h13 . Note that albeit the splitting between these\nstates is small, the state derived from the closed-shell\nconfiguration e20 h21 is relatively \"inert\" in that it mixes\nweakly with other states. In particular the weight of this\nconfiguration in the CI expansion is \u223c 83%. Below, we\ndiscuss the energy, polarization and lifetime of \u03c903 and\n\u03c902 .\nTrions. The negatively- (X \u2212 ) and positively-charged\n\n\f4\n(X + ) trions have ground states that are bright, two-fold\ndegenerate and arise from occupying e20 h10 and e10 h20 , respectively. Due to configuration-interaction mixing, the\nground states of X \u2212 and X + mix with e20 h11 and e10 h10 h11 ,\nrespectively. As in the case of XX 0, even at T \u223c 0 K the\nrecombination \u03c900 of X \u2212 [Fig. 1(c)] into state e10 h00 and\nthat of X + [Fig. 1(d)] into state e00 h10 is fast. For both\ntrions, while there are only two dipole-allowed transitions\nin the absence of spin-orbit coupling, we predict four allowed transitions. The first few excited states of X \u2212\ncorrespond to occupying states derived primarily from\ne20 h11 , e20 h12 and e20 h13 [Fig. 1(c)]. (Naturally, these states\nare mixed in with other states of X \u2212 .) These excited\nstates are two-fold degenerate and lie, correspondingly,\nabout 10 meV, 13 meV and 20 meV above the ground\nstate, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Note the similarity of the\nlow-lying excited states energy spacing with that in X 0 .\nIn addition, note that one of the two states derived from\ne20 h12 is optically active and emits light polarized along\n[001] [\u22a5 in Fig. 1(c)]. Again, these states become optically forbidden for a 20 \u00c5-tall dot. The excited states\nof X + are more complex and present a high density of\nstates [Fig. 1(d)]; a consequence of the closely spaced\n(\u223c 5 meV) single-particle hole levels: In contrast to X \u2212 ,\nall low-lying excited states show fine-structure splitting\ndue to electron-hole exchange. The first excited states at\nabout 5 meV corresponds to occupying e10 h10 h11 , due to the\ntwo-fold degeneracy of each of these single-particle states,\nthere are eight excited states that split in two groups of\nfour, due to hole-hole exchange. Occupying e10 h10 h12 leads\nto the next eight excited states around 10 meV, which\nare also split in two quartets. In this case, there is an optically active (polarization k [001]) pair of excited states\nthat belong to the lower-energy quartet [\u22a5, Fig. 1(d)].\nAs in the other excitons, these states become dark as the\ndot height decreases. The next ten excited states about\n14 meV are a mixture of eight configurations derived from\ne10 h10 h13 and two from e10 h21 . Because e0 is half-filled, e10 h21\nis very \"reactive\" in the sense that it heavily mixes via\nconfiguration interaction. Note that this is significantly\ndifferent from the case of configuration e20 h20 in the biexciton [Fig. 1(b)]. Higher excited states correspond to\noccupying e10 h11 h12 and e10 h11 h13 . Below, we discuss the energy, as well as polarization and lifetime of \u03c900 for X \u2212\nand X + .\n\n\u03c9i0 (X 0 )\n\u03c9if (X \u2212 )\n\u03c9if (X + )\n\u03c9if (XX 0 )\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nE (i) (X 0 )\n(e)\nE (i) (X \u2212 ) \u2212 Ef\n(h)\nE (i) (X + ) + Ef\nE (i) (XX 0 ) \u2212 E (f ) (X 0 ).\n\nwhere i and f label an initial and final state, respec(e)\n(h)\ntively; Ef and Ef are, respectively, the single-particle\nenergy of the electron and hole in the final state; and\nE (\u03bd) (\u03c7q ) is the multi-particle, configuration-interaction\nenergy of state |\u03a8(\u03bd) (\u03c7q )i.

The final states upon electron-hole recombination are presented in the shaded area of Fig.\n1. Figure 2 shows the recombination energies \u03c900 (X \u2212 ),\n\u03c900 (X + ) and \u03c903 (XX 0 ) calculated at the many-particle,\nconfiguration-interaction level as a function of dot height.\nThese recombination energies are shown relative to the\nlowest recombination energy \u03c920 (X 0 ) of the monoexciton (the latter energy is shown in the top axis of Fig.\n2). Thus, the results correspond to spectroscopic shifts\nthat are currently measured by several groups. Prominent features:\n(i) The recombination energy \u03c900 (X \u2212 ) blue-shifts as\nheight increases; in contrast, \u03c900 (X + ) red-shifts.

The latter balance\n(e)\narises from the similar degree of localization of \u03c80 and\n(h)\n\u03c80 within the dot.25\n(iv) \u03c903 (XX 0 ) \u2212 \u03c920 (X 0 ) = \u22122.0 meV at h = 50 \u00c5\nagrees with the value of \u22122.0 \u00b1 0.1 meV for XX 0 measured by Finley and coworkers in PL experiments in an\n(In,Ga)As/GaAs dot [b = (230 \u00b1 70) \u00c5 and h = (25 \u00b1\n10) \u00c5] with exciton ground-state emission at \u223c 1.345 eV\n(Ref. 5).

Conversely, \u2206(\u03c7q ) < 0 implies the exciton is unbound. Note that the binding energy is defined\nwith respect to the ground-state energy of dissociated excitonic complexes. For instance, the binding energy of X 0\nis defined with respect to the energy of a non-interacting\nelectron-hole pair. In turn, the binding energy of the\nbiexciton XX 0 is defined with respect to the total energy of two non-interacting monoexcitons [Eq.

(17)] for the\nlowest optical transitions of (a) X 0 , (b) XX 0 , (c) X \u2212 , and\n(d) X + . (See Fig. 1.) The transitions of X 0 and XX 0\nare polarized along [110] and [11\u03040], and the degree of this\npolarization strongly depends on height. For X \u2212 and X + ,\nthe transitions are not polarized neither along [110] nor [11\u03040].\n\n(c) X \u2212 , and (d) X + as a function of dot height. Two\nfeatures are prominent:\n(i) The bright transitions \u03c920 (X 0 ) and \u03c930 (X 0 ) are\npolarized and the polarization anisotropy depends on\nheight; see Fig. 4(a). Similarly, the lowest transitions\nof the biexciton \u03c903 (XX 0 ) and \u03c902 (XX 0 ) are polarized\nand the degree of polarization also depends on height.\nThese transitions correspond to the decay into the two\nbright states of the monoexciton [Fig. 1(d)]. Clearly,\nthe biexciton transitions inherit the polarization of the\nmonoexciton transitions. For both X 0 and XX 0 , we see\nthat \u03bb switches sign as a function of height. In particular, at h = 50 \u00c5 the transitions of X 0 present no in-plane\npolarization anisotropy [see arrow in Figs. 4(a)] because\nthe bright doublet formed by |\u03a8(2) (X 0 )i and |\u03a8(3) (X 0 )i\nis degenerate, which according to our calculation results\nin I ([110]) (\u03c920 ) \u2243 I ([11\u03040]) (\u03c920 ).\n(ii) The lowest optical transitions of X \u2212 and X + have\ndegenerate transition (recombination) energies [Fig. 1(b)\nand (c)] and, according to our calculations, this results in\nI ([110]) (\u03c900 ) \u2243 I ([11\u03040]) (\u03c900 ) and, thus, negligible in-plane\npolarization anisotropy regardless of height.\nIn addition to (i) and (ii), we find that (iii) the inplane polarization anisotropy of the lowest transitions of\nX 0 and XX 0 depends dramatically on the dot's alloy\nrandomness (disorder realization); as shown in Figure 5\nfor seven alloy realizations in a 35 \u00c5-tall dot. For a given\ntransition in both X 0 and XX 0 , \u03bb changes sign depending on alloy randomness. Further, while some alloy realizations like 4 and 5 result in transitions nearly fully\npolarized (\u03bb \u223c 99%), others such as 2, 6 and 7 present\nsmall anisotropy (\u03bb \u223c 20%).\n\n1.203\n\n1.206\n\n1.209\n\nRecombination energy (eV)\n\nFIG. 5: In-plane polarization \u03bb for the lowest optical transitions of (a) X 0 and (b) XX 0 for different realizations of\nalloy randomness in a 35 \u00c5-tall In0.6 Ga0.4 As/GaAs dot (base\nb = 252 \u00c5).

In\naddition, the refractive index n of the dot material accounts for the material's effects on the photon emission.\nThe linear dependence of 1/\u03c4if (\u03c7q ) on refractive index is\napplicable only when considering dot and matrix materials with similar dielectric constants, as it is the case in\nInGaAs/GaAs dots. In a more general case, more complicate dependences have been proposed.28 Note that the\ncharacteristic radiative lifetime [Eq. (18)] does not depend on temperature nor on the occupation probability of\nthe initial state |\u03a8(i) (\u03c7q )i, as it is a characteristic property of the transition |\u03a8(i) (\u03c7q )i \u2192 |\u03a8(f ) (\u03c7q \u2212 1)i. On\nthe other hand, the actual radiative lifetime \u03c4 (\u03c7q ) of exciton \u03c7q depends both on the probability ni of having\nthe initial states |\u03a8(i) (\u03c7q )i of exciton \u03c7q occupied and\nthe number of final states |\u03a8(f ) (\u03c7q \u2212 1)i of exciton \u03c7q \u2212 1\navailable for recombination, as well as on the characteristic radiative lifetimes \u03c4if (\u03c7q ).

In addition, we have neglected the long-lived recombinations \u03c900\nand \u03c910 . Figure 6(a) shows the characteristic \u03c420 (X 0 )\nversus dot height. We find that this lifetime depends\nweakly on height. A calculation of \u03c4 (X 0 ) at T = 10 K\npredicts a moderate decrease in the monoexciton radiative lifetime as height increases [Fig. 6(b)]. It should be\nnoted that \u03c4 (X 0 ) is actually bigger than the approximate\nvalue of 2\u03c420 (X 0 ) [Eq. (20)] due to the actual occupation\nprobability ni (10 K, X 0) of the initial states. By measuring time-resolved photoluminescence in InAs/GaAs\ndots (b = 120-220 \u00c5, height unspecified) with monoexciton emission ranging from 1.2-1.3 eV, Karachinsky and\ncoworkers have recently observed the opposite trend,30\ni. e. \u03c4 (X 0 ) increases with dot size from 1 ns in a dot\nwith emission energy of 1.31 eV to \u223c 3 ns in one with\nemission energy of 1.25 eV. The values of \u03c4 (X 0 ) we\npredict for tall dots (h = 65 \u00c5 and 75 \u00c5) agree satisfactorily with the value of 1 ns measured by Buckle et al\nfor an InAs/GaAs dot (b \u223c 120 \u00c5, h \u223c 30\u00c5) with gap\n1.131 eV (Ref. 31) at a temperature of 6 K. Further,\nour predictions also agree well with the value of 1.55 ns\nextracted from time-resolved photoluminescence experiments at 10 K performed in InAs/GaAs dots (b = 200 \u00c5,\nh = 20 \u00c5) by Bardot and coworkers.32\nBiexciton.

At T = 0 K, and assuming fast nonradiative relaxation to the dark ground-state of X 0 , the\nradiative lifetime of the monoexciton \u03c4 (X 0 ) equals the\ncharacteristic radiative lifetime \u03c400 (X 0 ) and it is long\n(\u223c ms). At finite temperatures, all four levels [Fig. 1(a)]\nof the X 0 ground state are thermally populated and emit\nlight with their own characteristic lifetime [Eq. (18)].\nFor temperatures such that the lowest four monoexciton\nstates are occupied, while the occupation of excited states\nis negligible, we calculate the radiative lifetime from Eq.\n(19) and find\n\n2\n\n\u03c4(X+)\n1\n\n\u03c4(X-)\n\u03c4(XX0)\n\n0\n20\n\n35\n\n50\n\n65\n\n75\n\nDot height (\u00c5)\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) (a) Characteristic radiative lifetime\n\u03c4if (\u03c7q ) [Eq.

For X 0 and XX 0 ,\nthe characteristic lifetimes are nearly the same and depend\nweakly on height. A stronger dependence on height is found\nfor X \u2212 and X + . (b) T = 10 K radiative lifetime \u03c4 (\u03c7q ) [Eq.\n(19)] of the lowest optical transition of X 0 , X \u2212 , X + , and\nXX 0 as a function of dot height. The lifetimes depend weakly\non height for all these excitons. For X 0 and XX 0 , the lifetimes are nearly the same. A similar trend is found for X \u2212\nand X + . At all heights, the radiative lifetimes of X \u2212 and X +\nare about twice as big as that of XX 0 .\n\n1(b)]. Thus, at T = 0 K, the radiative lifetime is given\nfrom Eq.

Figure 6(a) shows \u03c403 (XX 0 ) as\na function of height. We find a weak dependence with\nheight, as in the monoexciton case. Remarkably, we find\nthat \u03c420 (X 0 ) \u2243 \u03c403 (XX 0 ) regardless of height. The latter leads to the following relationship between the radiative lifetime of the monoexciton and biexciton,\n0\n\n\f9\n\n\u03c4 (XX 0 ) \u2243\n\n1\n\u03c4 (X 0 ).\n4\n\n(22)\n\nFigure 6(b) shows that at T = 10 K the calculated\n\u03c4 (XX 0 ) depends weakly on height, changing by about\n0.1 ns in the entire range of heights studied. \u03c4 (XX 0 ) is in\nexcellent agreement with the value of 0.5 ns measured by\nUlrich et al in an (In,Ga)As/GaAs quantum dot (b = 150200 \u00c5, h = 10-20 \u00c5) with an exciton gap of 1.337 eV (Ref.\n33).\nTrions. Both X \u2212 and X + have a two-fold degener-\n\n\u03c4 (X \u2212 ) =\n\nate ground state that is bright [Figs. 1(c) and (d)]. In\neach of these excitons, there are four lowest transitions;\nnamely, \u03c900 (X \u2212 ) [Fig. 1(c)], \u03c910 (X \u2212 ), \u03c901 (X \u2212 ), and\n\u03c911 (X \u2212 ); and \u03c900 (X + ) [Fig. 1(d)], \u03c910 (X + ), \u03c901 (X + ),\nand \u03c911 (X + ), for X \u2212 and X + , respectively. In turn,\neach of these transitions have a corresponding characteristic radiative lifetime. For the latter, our calculations\npredict \u03c400 (X \u2212 ) = \u03c411 (X \u2212 ) and \u03c401 (X \u2212 ) = \u03c410 (X \u2212 ) as\nwell as \u03c400 (X + ) = \u03c411 (X + ) and \u03c401 (X + ) = \u03c410 (X + ).\nThus, at T = 0 K, the radiative lifetimes of X \u2212 and X +\nare given by\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001b\u22121\n\u001a \u0014\n1\n1\n1\n\u03c400 (X \u2212 )\u03c401 (X \u2212 )\n1\n1\n1\n+\n=\n+\n+\n,\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2 \u03c400 (X ) \u03c401 (X )\n2 \u03c410 (X ) \u03c411 (X )\n\u03c400 (X \u2212 ) + \u03c401 (X \u2212 )\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001b\u22121\n\u001a \u0014\n1\n1\n1\n\u03c400 (X + )\u03c401 (X + )\n1\n1\n1\n+\n=\n+\n+\n.\n\u03c4 (X + ) =\n+\n+\n+\n+\n2 \u03c400 (X ) \u03c401 (X )\n2 \u03c410 (X ) \u03c411 (X )\n\u03c400 (X + ) + \u03c401 (X + )\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\nFigure 6(a) shows the height dependence of \u03c400 (X \u2212 )\nand \u03c401 (X \u2212 ), and \u03c400 (X + ) and \u03c401 (X + ). These characteristic radiative lifetimes depend strongly and nonmonotonically on height. This non-monotonic dependence translates into a rather simple and monotonic\n\u03c4 (X \u2212 ) and \u03c4 (X + ), as shown in Fig. 6(b). For flat dots\n\u03c4 (X \u2212 ) \u2243 \u03c4 (X + ), whereas for taller dots these lifetimes\nbecome slightly different. Our predicted \u03c4 (X \u2212 ) are in\nsatisfactory agreement with the value of 0.6 ns recently\nobserved by Smith and co-workers in (In,Ga)As/GaAs\ndots (size unspecified) with exciton ground-state emission at \u223c 1.318 eV (Ref. 1). We find that the radiative lifetimes of the charged trions satisfy the relationship\n\u03c4 (X 0 ) > \u03c4 (X \u2212 ) \u223c \u03c4 (X + ) > \u03c4 (XX 0 ).\n\nV.\n\nCOMPARISON OF X 0 , X \u2212 , X + , AND XX 0 IN\nLENS-SHAPED PURE INAS/GAAS WITH\nALLOYED (IN,GA)AS/GAAS DOTS\n\nFor completeness, we briefly compare the binding\nand recombination energies, polarization anisotropy,\nand radiative lifetimes in lens-shaped pure, non-alloyed\nInAs/GaAs dots with In0.6 Ga0.4 As/GaAs dots. Note\nthat Williamson, Wang, and Zunger have already compared results for X 0 for several alloy profiles.16 In Ref.\n25 we predicted that hole localization takes place at the\ndot-GaAs matrix interface as the height of these dots increases above 35 \u00c5. Thus, we discuss here two flat dots\n(h = 20 \u00c5 and 35 \u00c5) with base b = 252 \u00c5.\n(i) Recombination energies are smaller in InAs/GaAs\ndots than in In0.6 Ga0.4 As/GaAs dots with the same ge-\n\nometry. For instance, \u03c920 (X 0 ) = 1.078 eV and 0.987 eV\nfor h = 20 \u00c5 and 35 \u00c5, respectively.\n(ii) The spectroscopic shifts show the same trends\nwith height in flat InAs/GaAs as those in flat\nIn0.6 Ga0.4 As/GaAs dots. So do the binding energies\n\u2206(X \u2212 ) and \u2206(X + ), and \u2206(XX 0 ). However, there are\ntwo important differences bewteen the pure, non-alloyed\nInAs/GaAs dots and their In0.6 Ga0.4 As/GaAs counterparts: (a) For the 20 \u00c5-tall InAs/GaAs dot, while\nthe binding energies still satisfy \u2206(X \u2212 ) > \u2206(XX 0 ) >\n\u2206(X + ), we find that X + and XX 0 are bound, with\n\u2206(X + ) = 1.6 meV and \u2206(XX 0 ) = 1.5 meV, respectively. This is so because at this height the InAs/GaAs\n(hh)\n=\ndot is in the nearly \"symmetric\" regime: J00\n(ee)\n(eh)\n25.6 meV \u223c J00 = 25.1 meV \u223c J00 = 25.3 meV,\nso the Hartree-Fock component of the binding energy\n[see Eq. (13) for XX 0 case] is much smaller than in the\nIn0.6 Ga0.4 As/GaAs dot with same height. Thus, correlation becomes capable of binding X + and XX 0 in the\npure, non-alloyed dot. (b) For the 35 \u00c5-tall InAs/GaAs\ndot, we find ordering reversal, i.e. \u2206(X + ) > \u2206(XX 0 ) >\n\u2206(X \u2212 ). In In0.6 Ga0.4 As/GaAs dots, this ordering is attained at h = 50 \u00c5 (Fig. 3).\n(iii) In contrast to the findings in In0.6 Ga0.4 As/GaAs\ndots, transitions \u03c920 (X 0 ) and \u03c930 (X 0 ) are fully polarized along [110] (\u03bb = 1) and [11\u03040] (\u03bb = \u22121), respectively, regardless of height. Consequently, \u03c903 (XX 0 ) and\n\u03c902 (XX 0 ) are fully polarized along [11\u03040] and [110], respectively. These polarizations are expected from a dot\nwith C2v symmetry, like a lens-shaped pure InAs/GaAs\ndot.\n\n\f10\n(iv) Radiative lifetimes \u03c4 (X 0 ), \u03c4 (X + ) and \u03c4 (X \u2212 ), and\n\u03c4 (XX 0 ) are similar to those in In0.6 Ga0.4 As/GaAs dots\nwith the same geometry. For instance, \u03c4 (X 0 ) = 2.8 ns\nand \u03c4 (XX 0 ) = 0.7 ns for h = 35 \u00c5; and \u03c4 (X 0 ) = 2.9 ns\nand \u03c4 (XX 0 ) = 0.6 ns for h = 20 \u00c5.\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have addressed the height dependence of recombination energies, polarization and radiative lifetimes of\nthe lowest optical transitions of the neutral exciton (X 0 ),\nnegatively- (X \u2212 ) and positively-charged (X + ) trions,\nand the biexciton (XX 0 ) in lens-shaped, self assembled\nIn0.6 Ga0.4 As/GaAs quantum dots. We have predicted\nthe following.\n(i) The recombination energy of the lowest transition of\nX \u2212 , X + and XX 0, correspondingly, \u03c900 (X \u2212 ), \u03c900 (X + )\nand \u03c903 (XX 0 ) shows qualitatively different behavior for\neach excitonic complex. Namely, \u03c900 (X \u2212 ) blue-shifts as\nheight increases, whereas that of \u03c900 (X + ) red-shifts. On\nthe other hand, as height increases, \u03c903 (XX 0 ) shows\na red-shift at small heights, reaches a maximum shift,\nand then blue-shifts for taller dots. This behavior is explained by the height dependence and relative magnitude\n(ee)\n(hh)\n(eh)\nof J00 , J00 and J00 .\n(ii) The binding energies \u2206(X \u2212 ), \u2206(X + ) and \u2206(XX 0 )\nfollow the height dependence of the emission spectroscopic shifts. Changes in the dot height drives a boundto-unbound crossover for each of these complexes.\n\n1\n\n2\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n9\n\n10\n\nJ. M. Smith, P. A. Dalgarno, R. J. Warburton, A. O.

Grund-\n\n(iii) The in-plane polarization anisotropy \u03bb of the lowest transitions of X 0 (\u03c920 ) and XX 0 (\u03c903 ) strongly depends on dot height as well as on alloy randomness (disorder realization). In contrast, the lowest transitions of\nX \u2212 and X + present negligible \u03bb regardless of height.\n(iv) The ground state of X 0 encompasses four states\nthat split off in a low-energy pair that is dark and a highenergy pair that is bright, with a bright-dark splitting\nthat increases as height decreases. Thus, at T = 0 K\nthe radiative lifetime \u03c4 (X 0 ) of X 0 is long. On the\nother hand, at T = 10 K both dark and bright states\nare populated; so, \u03c4 (X 0 ) becomes fast, moderately decreases as height increases, and its magnitude ranges\nfrom 2-3 ns. In contrast, \u03c4 (X \u2212 ), \u03c4 (X + ) and \u03c4 (XX 0 )\nare fast even at T = 0 K, as a consequence of these\nexcitons having ground states that are bright. These\nradiative lifetimes depend weakly on height. Further,\n\u03c4 (X \u2212 ) \u223c \u03c4 (X + ) \u2243 1.1 ns, while \u03c4 (XX 0 ) \u2243 0.5 ns.\nWe have compared these predictions with available\ndata and have found them in satisfactory agreement. In\naddition, we compared with results in pure, non-alloyed\nInGa/GaAs quantum dots.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Alberto Franceschetti (NREL) for valuable discussions.
