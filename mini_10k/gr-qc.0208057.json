INTRODUCTION\nAccording to Wheeler's pregeometry, properties of the spacetime manifold, such as metric,\ncontinuity, dimensionality, topology, locality, symmetry, and causality might evolve\nmathematically from modeling underlying classical spacetime dynamics (Gibbs, 1998). This\napproach has been labeled \"bottom up\" by Requardt & Roy (2001) in contrast to the \"top down\"\napproach originally proposed by Sakharov (1967) and developed more recently by Akama &\nOda (1992), and Terazawa (1992). In top down pregeometry, particle physics is assumed\nfundamental to the spacetime geometry while Wheeler assumed \"the order of progress may not\nbe physics \u2192 pregeometry, but pregeometry \u2192 physics\" (Misner, Thorne & Wheeler, 1973).\nIn an early attempt to derive dimensionality, Wheeler assigned probability amplitudes to the\nmembers of a Borel set1 to stochastically establish spacetime adjacency (Wheeler, 1964). He\nabandoned this idea, in part, because \"too much geometric structure is presupposed to lead to a\nbelievable theory of geometric structure\" (Wheeler, 1980). In particular, he considered the\nmanner in which probability amplitudes were assigned, and a metric introduced, to be ad hoc.\nHowever, recent models by Nagels (1985), Antonsen (1994), and Nowotny & Requardt (1998)\nemploying graph theory have, arguably, surmounted these objections.\nIn these approaches, assumptions concerning the stochastic analyses are minimal and natural.\nNagels (1985), for example, assumes only that the order of the underlying set is large and the\nprobability of adjacency is small. And, the notion of length per graph theory is virtually innate.\n\n1. \"Loosely speaking, a Borel set is a collection of points which have not yet been assembled into a manifold of any\nparticular dimensionality. Whether they are put together into lines, or surfaces, or volumes, or manifolds of higher\ndimensionality, or into odd combinations of such objects of varied dimensionality, is a matter of choice.\" (Wheeler,\n1964)\n\n2\n\n\fThus, Wheeler's pregeometric progeny have managed to obtain dimensionality, in various forms,\nover otherwise structureless sets.\nOf course, one might contend that the connections between set members (bonds, links, edges)\nprovide excessive a priori structure. However, connections are as fundamental to graph theory as\nthe set itself. And we note, insofar as pregeometry is a search for a fundamental language of\nphysics, the graph theoretical approach resonates with Heylighen's suggestion that a fundamental\nlanguage of physics might be couched in \"processes\" (Heylighen, 1990). His \"events and\narrows\" parallel the \"points and links\" of the graph theoretical approaches supra. Antonsen\n(1994), for example, refers to his links as \"interactions\" and defines \"corresponding 'second\nquantization' operators b, b+.\" And, Requardt (2000) refers to \"dynamical bonds which transfer\nthe elementary pieces of information among the nodes.\" It bodes well for the graph theoretical\napproach that a self-consistency relationship between spacetime geometry and physical processes\n\u2013 a pregeometric version of Einstein's equations \u2013 is already implied.\nGiven the promising nature of graph theory for bottom up pregeometry, we introduce a\ncomplementary approach. Whereby in graph theory the connection is fundamental to the metric\nand large-order sets are employed, our approach uses small-order sets and connections are\ninferred from the metric. This type of bottom up pregeometry may have bearing on the modeling\nof quantum phenomena such as non-locality, where one might expect the structure of\nmicroscopic spacetime neighborhoods differs from that of macroscopic spacetime neighborhoods\n(Stuckey, 1999). To contrast the statistical approach, we introduce uniformity bases induced by\ndiscrete topological groups. The use of metrizable uniformities in bottom up pregeometry has\nalready proven effective in producing spacetime dimensionality (Bergliaffa et al., 1998). In our\napproach, all subsets are open \u2013 the discrete topology, as with graph theory (Nowotny &\n\n3\n\n\fRequardt, 1999) \u2013 and any group structure permissible. We begin by describing our construct of\na uniformity base over a discrete topological group.\n\n2. THE UNIFORMITY BASE, ENTOURAGE SEQUENCE AND METRIC\nWe refer to the underlying set X of order N as a Borel set, since it is denumerable, finite\nand structureless per Wheeler's description, and its members needn't be zero-dimensional\nobjects. The category of uniform spaces subsumes topological groups (Miyata, 1993) and a\ntopological group may be created over any group with the discrete topology. Therefore, in the\nspirit of avoiding arbitrary assumptions, we assume all subsets of X are open and that we are free\nto consider any group structure G of order N.\nTo review briefly, a uniformity over a set X (or uniform space) is constructed from\ncollections of pairs (x, y) \u2208 X x X. Each collection of pairs is called an entourage. Entourages A\nand B may be multiplied in an obvious fashion, i.e., AB is the collection of pairs (x, z) such that\n(x, w) is in A and (w, z) is in B. The collection of entourages must satisfy the following\nproperties in order that they constitute a uniform space:\n1. The intersection of all entourages is precisely \u2206 \u2261 {(x, x) \uf8e6 x \u2208 X} \u2200 x \u2208 X. The\nentourage \u2206 is called the diagonal.\n2. If A is an entourage, A-1 \u2261 {(w, z) \uf8e6 (z, w) \u2208 A} is an entourage.\n3. If A is an entourage, there exists an entourage B such that BB \u2282 \u0391.\n4. The intersection of two entourages is an entourage, and the superset of an entourage is an\nentourage.\nWe construct a uniformity base U\u0392 for the uniformity U via neighborhoods of the identity\ne of G per Geroch (1985). The entourage A\u03b1 of U is {(x, y) \u2208 X x X \uf8e6 xy-1 \u2208 \u03b1} where \u03b1 is a\nneighborhood of e in the topology over X. With X denumerable of order N,\n{(w, y) \u2208 X x X \uf8e6 w \u2260 y} is partitioned equally into the entourages Ax (x \u2208 X such that x \u2260 e)\n\n4\n\n\ffor the N \u2013 1, order-two neighborhoods of e, i.e., Ax is generated by {e, x}. The entourages Ax\nand \u2206 constitute our uniformity base U\u0392 for U.\nIn order to produce a metric from this uniformity base, we borrow from a proof of the\nfollowing theorem by Engelking (1989).\n\"For every sequence V0, V1, ... of members of a uniformity on a set S, where\nV0 = X x X and (Vi+1)3 \u2282 Vi for i = 1,2,...,\nthere exists a pseudometric \u03c1 on the set S such that for every i \u2265 1\n{(x, y) \uf8e6 \u03c1 (x, y) < (1\u20442)i } \u2282 Vi \u2282 {(x, y) \uf8e6 \u03c1 (x, y) \u2264 (1\u20442)i }.\"\nTo find \u03c1 (x, y), consider all sequences of elements of S beginning with x and ending with y. For\neach adjacent pair (xn, xn+1) in any given sequence, find the smallest member of {Vi} containing\nthat pair. [The smallest Vi will have the largest i, since (Vi+1)3 \u2282 Vi.] Suppose Vm is that smallest\nmember and let the 'artificial' distance between xn and xn+1 be (1\u20442)m. Summing for all adjacent\npairs in a given sequence yields an 'artificial' distance between x and y for that particular\nsequence. According to the theorem, \u03c1 (x, y) is the greatest lowest bound obtained via the\nsequences.\nSince our set X is denumerable and finite, this greatest lower bound will be non-zero and\nthe result will be a metric. In order to obtain a metric with maximal resolution (fine metric) per\nthis formalism, we need an entourage sequence V0, V1, ... of maximal length. In order to produce\nsuch a sequence from the members of U\u0392, we note the following two properties.\nFirst, not all the elements of our U\u0392 will be symmetric as required by Engelking's proof.\nIn fact, Ax is symmetric for all x \u2208 X such that x = x-1. This, since for (y, z) \u2208 Ax such that y \u2260 z,\nyz-1 = x and therefore, zy-1 = x-1 = x \u21d2 (z, y) \u2208 Ax. For the base members Ax and Ay such that\n\n5\n\n\fx = y-1, we have Ax-1 = Ay. This, since for (w, z) \u2208 Ax such that w \u2260 z, wz-1 = x and therefore,\nzw-1 = x-1 = y \u21d2 (z, w) \u2208 Ay. Accordingly, for x = y-1 we must have Ax \u222a Ay appear in any Vi to\nmaintain the symmetry required by Engelking's theorem.\nSecond, we show that entourage multiplication of the Ax \u2208 U\u0392 mirrors the underlying\ngroup structure. With \u2206 a subset of any entourage (uniquely and axiomatically), we have in\ngeneral for entourages A and B that A \u2282 AB and B \u2282 AB. Now consider\n{(x, y), (y, z) \uf8e6 (x, y) \u2208 As and (y, z) \u2208 Aw with x \u2260 y and y \u2260 z}. In addition to \u2206, these account\nexhaustively for the elements of As and Aw. For any such pair (x, y) and (y, z), (x, z) \u2208 AsAw by\ndefinition and (x, z) \u2208 Asw, since sw = (xy-1)(yz-1) = xz-1. The N pairs (x, z) with \u2206 account\nexhaustively for the elements of Asw and, excepting the impact of \u2206 on AsAw, the N pairs (x, z)\naccount exhaustively for the elements of AsAw. Again, the impact of \u2206 on AsAw is to render\nAs \u2282 AsAw and Aw \u2282 AsAw. Therefore, AsAw = As \u222a Aw \u222a Asw. Accordingly, we may exploit\nsubgroup structure to produce an entourage sequence of maximal length. Nested subgroup\nstructures are particularly useful, since we require (Vi+1)3 \u2282 Vi. As an example of this approach,\nand to illustrate how it can generate dimensionality, we obtain a fine metric over Z2 x Z4.\n\n3. METRIC AND DIMENSIONALITY OVER Z2 x Z4\nLet X = {a, b, c, e, A, B, C, D} with the lower case elements closed under the algebra of\nthe Z4 (sub)group where b = b-1 and e is the identity. With 0 and 1 the typical elements of Z2, the\nupper case elements of X can be identified as A = (1, a), B = (1, b), C = (1, c), and D = (1, e). We\nhave a nested subgroup structure of Z2 \u2282 Z4 \u2282 Z2 x Z4, so we choose the following entourage\nsequence via U\u0392 :\n\n6\n\n\fV3 = Ab\nV2 = Ab \u222a Aa \u222a Ac\nV1 = Ab \u222a Aa \u222a Ac \u222a AD\nV0 = Ab \u222a Aa \u222a Ac \u222a AD \u222a AA \u222a AB \u222a AC\nwhich yields the following hierarchy for 'artificial' distances between pairs:\n{(a,c), (b,e), (A,C), (B,D)} \u21d2 1/8\n\n[xy-1 = b]\n\n{(a,e), (b,a), (c,b), (e,c), (A,D), (B,A), (C,B), (D,C)} \u21d2 1/4\n\n[xy-1 = a or c]\n\n{(a,A), (b,B), (c,C), (e,D)} \u21d2 1/2\n\n[xy-1 = D]\n\n{(a,D), (b,A), (c,B), (e,C), (A,e), (B,a), (C,b), (D,c)} \u21d2 1\n\n[xy-1 = B]\n\n{(a,C), (b,D), (c,A), (e,B), (A,c)} \u21d2 1\n\n[xy-1 = A or C].\n\nTherefore, we have the following metric structure (after a convenient renormalization):\ng(x,y) = 1\n\ng(x,y) = 2\n\ng(x,y) = 4\n\ng(x,y) = 5\n\ng(x,y) = 6\n\n(a,c)\n\n(a,e)\n\n(a,A)\n\n(a,C)\n\n(a,B)\n\n(b,e)\n\n(b,a)\n\n(b,B)\n\n(b,D)\n\n(b,C)\n\n(A,C)\n\n(c,b)\n\n(c,C)\n\n(c,A)\n\n(c,D)\n\n(B,D)\n\n(e,c)\n\n(e,D)\n\n(e,B)\n\n(e,A)\n\n(A,D)\n\n(C,e)\n\n(B,A)\n\n(D,a)\n\n(C,B)\n\n(A,b)\n\n(D,C)\n\n(B,c)\n\n7\n\n\fThis is consistent with two, triangular polyhedra occupying E3's (figure 1) that are\nembedded in E4. In this embedding, the distances 1, 2, and 4 are understood as straight line\n(direct) distances while the distances 5 and 6 are obtained along indirect paths. For example,\ng(e,A) = 6 obtains along the path e \u2192 a \u2192 A, since g(e,a) = 2 and g(a,A) = 4. [The pathdependent interpretation of g obtains with any embedding, tacitly if not explicitly.] Thus, the\ngroup structure Z2 x Z4 induces an E4-embedded graph. In a similar manner, D4, Z6, D3, Z8, and\nZ5 generate dimensionality via Euclidean-embedded graphs.\n\n4. OTHER EXAMPLES\nWe first consider the fourth dihedral group (D4 \u2013 symmetry group over the square) for\nreasons immediately apparent. A maximal entourage sequence for D4 contains four entourages.\nV3 and V2 are generated by the rotations \u2013 the Z4 subgroup \u2013 in exactly the same manner as\nZ2 x Z4. Adding any member of UB based on a reflection to V2 yields V1, since the reflections are\ntheir own inverses. And, of course, V0 = X x X. Perhaps not surprisingly, given the nested\nZ2 \u2282 Z4 \u2282 D4 structure, the embedded graph is precisely that generated by Z2 x Z4 (figure 1).\nChoosing to exploit the Z2 \u2282 Z2 x Z2 \u2282 D4 nested structure yields the same embedded structure\nwith permuted nodes. [The possible use of such ambiguity in the modeling of quantum\nstochasticity is discussed in section 5.] That two distinct group structures generate the same\nembedded graph also obtains with Z6 and D3.\nWe choose the typical representation of Z6, addition mod 6 over {0,1,2,3,4,5}. Then a\nmaximal entourage sequence from UB is:\n\n8\n\n\fV2 = A2 \u222a A4 \u2283 {(2,0), (4,0), (2,4), (1,5), (1,3), (3,5)}\nV1 = A2 \u222a A4 \u222a A3 \u2283 {(2,5), (4,1), (0,3)}\nV0 = A1 \u222a A2 \u222a A3 \u222a A4 \u222a A5 = X x X.\nSince V2 is constructed via the Z3 subgroup, 0, 2 and 4 are paired in V2 as are their complements\n1, 3 and 5. Therefore, the fundamental Euclidean-embeddable structures are equilateral triangles\n(E2-embeddable). These can be connected in E3 (figure 2), since V1 can be constructed from V2\nby adding one additional element of UB, i.e., A3. [That Z6 is isomorphic to Z2 x Z3 is manifested\nin this structure.] We could also choose to exploit the Z2 subgroup structure, i.e., let V2 = A3. In\nthat case we obtain the same E3 structure with different scaling (figure 3). D3 (symmetry group\nover the equilateral triangle) generates the same E3 structure as found in figure 2, since it also\ncontains the Z3 subgroup (rotations) upon which V2 is based, and adding any member of UB\nbased on a reflection to V2 yields V1.\nAnother group that generates three Euclidean dimensions is Z8. We choose the typical\nrepresentation of Z8, addition mod 8 over {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. We've a Z2 subgroup, so the first\nmember of our entourage sequence is A4. If we add A2 and A6 (completing the Z4 subgroup) to\nconstruct the next member, our first two entourages would generate two of the E3-embedded\ngraphs of figure 1. However, none of the remaining members of Z8 is its own inverse, so the next\nsimplest member of an entourage sequence will generate too many edges to complete the\nconnection of the E3 polyhedra in E4. Thus, we construct the second member of the sequence by\nadding A3 and A5 to the first entourage so our sequence is:\n\n9\n\n\fV2 = A4 \u2283 {(4,0), (1,5), (2,6), (3,7)}\nV1 = A4 \u222a A3 \u222a A5 \u2283 {(0,5), (0,3), (1,6), (1,4), (2,7), (2,5), (4,7), (3,6)}\nV0 = X x X.\nThis entourage sequence does generate a metric whence an E3-embeddable graph (figure 4).\nThe problem with finding an alternative to the connection of the E3 polyhedra in E4 also\nobtains with the quaternion group, Q8. Therein resides a Z2 subgroup, but the addition of any\nother element and its inverse produces a Z4 subgroup (unlike Z8). Thus, there is no Euclidean\nembedding induced by Q8 per this program.\nHitherto, our examples have yielded three or four Euclidean dimensions. Our last\nexample, Z5, generates but two dimensions. [Note: ZN is the only group structure of order N\nwhen N is prime.] We choose the typical representation of Z5, addition mod 5 over {0,1,2,3,4}.\nAs a group of prime order there are no subgroups, so we've but two members in our entourage\nsequence, e.g.,\nV1 = A1 \u222a A4 \u2283 {(1,0), (0,4), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3)}\nV0 = A1 \u222a A2 \u222a A3 \u222a A4 = X x X.\nWhile there isn't much of a resulting metric structure (all distances 1 or 2), we do obtain an E2embeddable structure, i.e., the pentagon (figure 5). From this example it is apparent that Z7 will\nnot generate an E4-embeddable structure, encountering precisely the same problems as Q8.\n\n5. SPECULATION ON A NEXUS TO PHYSICS\nPregeometry should make correspondence with modern physics, just as modern physics\nmakes correspondence with classical physics. While our pregeometric formalism is as yet\n\n10\n\n\finchoate, there are intimations as to how it might make correspondence with quantum\nstochasticity and non-locality/non-separability, collapse of the wave function, and the relativity\nof simultaneity \u2013 stalwart concepts of modern physics.\nConsider Z2 x Z2 x Z4 and the entangled quantum state\n\u03c8 =\n\n\u2191\u2193 \u00b1 \u2193\u2191\n2\n\n.\n\nOur group contains the nested subgroup structure Z2 \u2282 Z4 \u2282 Z2 x Z4 \u2282 Z2 x Z2 x Z4, so a\nmaximal entourage sequence is:\nV5 = Ab\nV4 = Ab \u222a Aa \u222a Ac\nV3 = Ab \u222a Aa \u222a Ac \u222a AD\nV2 = Ab \u222a Aa \u222a Ac \u222a AD \u222a AA \u222a AB \u222a AC\nV1 = Ab \u222a Aa \u222a Ac \u222a AD \u222a AA \u222a AB \u222a AC \u222a A\u03b4\nV0 = X x X\nwhere \u03b4 is the counterpart to D in the Z2 duplication. Equivalently, we may replace V1 with\nAb \u222a Aa \u222a Ac \u222a AD \u222a AA \u222a AB \u222a AC \u222a A\u03b2, where \u03b2 is the counterpart to B in the Z2\nduplication. Either of these entourage sequences produces a fine metric whence two 'E3polyhedra-embedded-in-E4' are embedded in E5. The choice of D or B in V3 fixes both E4\nsubstructures, so the connection between the two E4 subsets might be interrupted as a nonlocal/entangled, EPR-type2 relationship in the otherwise global E4 spacetime structure of\n2. EPR stands for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen, who articulated problems stemming from quantum non-locality in a\n1935 publication (Phys. Rev. 47, 777).\n\n11\n\n\fquantum mechanics (as opposed to an E5 embedding). Alternatively, the choice of \u03b4 or \u03b2 in V1\nmight be interpreted as fixing the temporal order of the measurements, which would allow the\ntemporal ordering of space-like separated measurements to be ambiguous, as in the relativity of\nsimultaneity per the M4 spacetime of special relativity.\nIn addition to originating with the ambiguity of entourage sequences, quantum\nstochasticity may also surface via incomplete spatio-temporal boundary conditions. In any theory\nof physics, a spacetime region is described uniquely only after providing specifics concerning its\nspatio-temporal boundary. Our approach desribes reality in terms of a unified space and time,\ni.e., the 'block universe'3 or spacetime of special relativity. Thus, we expect the unique\ndescription of a spacetime region will require information about its future boundary. An inability\nto supply this information may lead to stochastic, rather than deterministic, descriptions of the\nspacetime region(s) in question.\nIn the entangled state supra, for example, knowing the temporal order of the\nmeasurements corresponds to specifying a particular spacetime foliation. This reduces ambiguity\nin the entourage sequence (fixes \u03b2 or \u03b4 in V1), thus reducing stochasticity. To determine the\nspatio-temporal description uniquely requires knowledge of a measurement outcome, which\nfixes B or D in V3. Thus, per this interpretation, the collapse of the quantum mechanical wave\nfunction is explicitly a two-step process in contrast to quantum mechanics whereby the choice of\na preferred spacetime foliation is tacit. And, wave function collapse is epistemological \u2013 not\nontological \u2013 as one would expect in a 'block universe' sans Everett's many-worlds\ninterpretation (DeWitt & Graham, 1973).\n3. A 'block universe' needn't be constructed dynamically, i.e., per the temporal evolution of a space-like\nhypersurface. However, it must subsume our dynamical perspective so as to be open to empirical investigation.\n\n12\n\n\f6. CONCLUSION\nWe have shown that metric structure and spacetime dimensionality may be induced over\na low-order Borel set per a uniformity base generated via discrete topological groups. The\ndimensionality produced herein is a simple embedding dimension generated from 'connections'\nbetween 'nodes'. Thus, should some of these connections ultimately correspond to physical\ninteractions, our embedding dimension may be viewed in a dynamical spirit a la Requardt's\n\"connectivity-dimension\" (Requardt, 1996).\nOur approach differs from graph theory in that connections are inferred from the metric,\nwhich obtains as a natural consequence of algebraic structure. Thus a denumerable, finite set and\nall its possible group structures are the fundamental constituents of this formalism, which is\nindifferent to domains of discourse and group representations \u2013 a pregeometric counterpart to\ngeneral covariance, if you will. Since this method is employed over low-order sets, it is intended\nto provide a pregeometric modeling of microscopic spacetime neighborhoods. And in fact, there\nare intimations of its potential for modeling quantum stochasticity and non-locality/nonseparability, wave function collapse, and M4 spacetime structure. Therefore, this formalism\ncounters Monk's contention that sub-Planck scale structures may not provide an ideal basis for\npregeometry, since quantum non-locality/non-separability occurs on macroscopic scales (Monk,\n1997).\nFinally, contrary to Bergliaffa et al. (1998), our pregeometric model does not employ\ntrans-temporal objects as fundamental constituents of reality. In this sense, we agree with\nGomatam (1999) who argues for a revision of our notion of macroscopic objects in accord with\nquantum non-separability. In this sense our pregeometry is amenable to the quantum gravity\nprograms of Heller & Sasin (1999) and Demaret et al. (1997), all of whom acknowledge the\n\n13\n\n\fimplications of quantum non-locality/non-separability on the modeling of microscopic spacetime\nneighborhoods. At this stage, it is probably best that researchers are engaged on all fronts.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis work was supported in part by the NATO Collaborative Linkage Grant PST.CLG.976850.\n\n14\n\n\fREFERENCES\nAkama, K. and Oda, I.
