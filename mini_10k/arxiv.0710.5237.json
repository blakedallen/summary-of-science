In most of the rest of Manhattan the\npopulation is at least 80 percent \"white\" (ignoring Hispanic), while Harlem is at least 80\npercent \"black\" [2]. Similar residential segregation has been observed in other places, along\nethnic, religious or other barriers, though often on a smaller scale. The city of the present\nauthors [3] has since years a tenth of its population from Turkish background and now it\ntries to deal with a plan to build a large mosque here, after years of partial segregation\ninto several \"Turkish\" city districts.\nSuch segregated residential districts can be caused by external forces, like the orders\nof Nazi Germany that all Jews have to live in small ghettos of Warsaw, Cracow, .... The\nalternative to be discussed here is the emergence of urban segregation without external\nforce, only through self-organisation due to the wishes of the residents.\nThis second possibility was already pointed out 25 centuries ago by the Greek philosopher Empedokles, who (according to J. Mimkes) found that humans are like liquids: some\nlive together like wine and water, and some like oil and water refuse to mix. This idea was\nformulated more clearly by the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in \"Wahlverwandtschaften\" two centuries ago (also according to J. Mimkes). The rest of this article\ndeals with the implementation of this basic idea.\n1\n\n\fSchelling published in 1971 the first quantitative model for the emergence of urban\nsegregation [4], in the same year in which physicist Weidlich [5] published his first paper\non sociodynamics. Schelling in 2005 got the economics \"Nobel\" prize; his 1971 paper has\nan exponentially rising citation rate and is the second-most-cited paper in this Journal of\nMathematical Sociology. His model is a complicated zero-temperature Ising ferromagnet\nbut this similarity to statistical physics was overlooked [6]. Only very recent publications\n[7, 8] pointed out that Schelling's original model fails to form large ghettos and leads only\nto small clusters of residences for the two groups in the population. Long before, Jones [9]\nintroduced some randomness into the model to produce large ghettos; this good paper, in\nturn, was mostly ignored for two decades.\nThe first citation to Schelling 1971 from physicists known to us is the book of Levy, Levy\nand Solomon [10], nearly three decades after publication. One of us (DS) learned about\nthe Schelling model from a meeting on Simulating Society in Poland, fall 2001 (though he\nshould have learned it from [10] of which he got preprints). He then was advised in spring\n2002 by Weidlich [5] to study learning for urban segregation, and forwarded this idea to\n[11, 12]. Vinkovic and Kirman [7] reviewed nicely the physics of hundred years ago in the\nEmpedokles-Goethe sense, but ignored the physics research of recent decades. We are not\naware of sociology to have taken note of the Ising model in the follow-up of the Schelling\nmodel [4]; as mentioned sociologists also mostly ignored the paper of their colleague Jones\n[9] in a sociology journal.\nThus we see here not only residential segregation, but also scholarly segregation, with\nphysicists ignoring the Schelling model until recently, and sociologists ignoring the similarity of the Schelling to the Ising model until now. Books like the present one can help to\nbridge the gap.\nThis article is written for physicists; an earlier article [8] was supposed to help also\nnon-physicists understand the Ising model in connection with urban segregation.\n\n2\n\nSchelling model\n\nIn order to check whether urban segregation can emerge from personal preferences without\nany overall management, discrimination etc, Schelling published in 1971 a modification of\nthe spin 1/2 Ising model at zero temperature. The majority of sites on a square lattice are\noccupied by people who belong to one of two groups A and B. The initial distribution is\nrandom: A and B in equal proportion; a minority of sites is empty. Everybody likes to be\nsurrounded by nearest and next-nearest neighbours of the same kind. People are defined\nas unhappy if the majority of their neighbours belongs to the other group, and as happy\n2\n\n\fif at least half of these neighbours belong to the own group. (Empty sites do not count in\nthis determination.) At each iteration with random sequential updating, unhappy people\nmove to the nearest place where they can be happy [4].\nAs a result, clusters are formed where A residences stick together, and also B people\ncluster together. These clusters remain also when details of the model, like the thresholds\nof happiness, are changed [4]. The lattices studied (by hand !) in that paper were too\nsmall to indicate whether the clusters become infinite in an infinite lattice, i.e. whether\nphase separation like oil in water happens. Only a third of a century later, a computational\nastrophysicists and an economist [7] showed that the clusters remain small even if large\nlattices are simulated. Thus the original Schelling model is unable to explain the formation of large ghettos like Harlem, but it can explain the clustering of a few B residences\nsurrounded by A houses. We have not yet found papers from sociology pointing out this\nfailure, though Jones [9] may have noticed it when he improved the model (see below),\nwithout stating it explicitly in his publication.\nEven without any computer simulation one can guess that the original Schelling model\nhad troubles. Solomon [8] pointed out that the following B cluster will never dissolve from\nwithin: Each B has four or more B sites in its neighbourhood of eight, feels happy and has\nno intention to move. The A have even less reason to move.\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\n\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\n\nAAAAAA\nAAAAAA\nABBAAA\nBBBBAA\nBBBBAA\nABBAAA\nAAAAAA\nAAAAAA\n\nAlso horizontal strips of A and B sites lead to blocking, as in Ising models [13], since even\nat the interface everybody is happily surrounded by neighbours mostly of the own group.\nTo avoid such blocking of cluster growth, Jones [9] removed a small fraction of people\nrandomly, and replaced them by people who feel happy in these vacancies. Then really\nlarge ghettos are formed. (The earlier Dethlefsen-Moody model also involves randomness\nand still gives only finite clusters, though larger than in the Schelling version, according to\nM\u00fcller [14].)\nAn alternative way to introduce some randomness [7] is to allow people to move even\nwhen their status (happy or unhappy) is not changed by this move. Then domains were\nsimulated to grow towards infinity, and the detailed behaviour of this growth process was\n3\n\n\fstudied later [15]. This assumption seems at first sociologically nonsensical: Why should\nanyone go through the troubles to move if this does not improve the situation?\nHowever, one may regard such \"useless\" moves as coming from forces external to the\nmodel, like when one moves to another city in order to switch employment. In that case,\nhowever, one may also be forced from a happy place to one where one feels unhappy, as\nis done below through a finite temperature T . Thus the model of [7, 15] is a nice physics\nmodel with limited sociological appeal.\n[Schelling assumed that A people stay A people forever, and the same applies to B\npeople. This may not be true with respect to religion or citizenship but is correct with\nrespect to skin colour. However, people also move out into another city, or in from another\ncity, and thus within the simulated area the number of A and B people can change. The\nblacks in Harlem may have had ancestors who worked on tobacco or cotton plantations, but\nthese plantations were further south and not in Manhattan. Jones [9] already simulated\nfluctuating compositions, and in contrast to an assertion in [7], the Ising models has been\nsimulated since decades for both fixed (Kawasaki) and fluctuating (Glauber, Metropolis)\nmagnetisations.]\n\n3\n3.1\n\nTwo groups, one temperature\nSchelling and Ising at positive T\n\nLife is unfair, and we do not always get what we want. Thus for accidents outside the\nmodel, like loss of job, marriage, ..., we sometimes have to change residences even if we\nlike the one in which we live. Thus we may not only have neutral moves as in [7] from\nunhappy to unhappy or from happy to happy, but also from happy to unhappy with some\nlow probability. This is the basis of thermal Monte Carlo methods (Metropolis, Glauber,\nHeat Bath algorithm), also for optimization (simulated annealing etc.) [16], where the\nenergy (unhappiness) is increased by \u2206E with a probability \u221d exp(\u2212\u2206E/kB T ). And then\nit also makes sense to look at different degrees of (un)happiness, that means to treat the\nnumber of neighbours from the other group as \u2206E. The standard two-dimensional Ising\nmodel then is the simplest choice.\nIn this sense, T plays the strength of the external noise which pushes us to move against\nour personal preferences. Instead, the temperature T can also be interpreted as \"tolerance\"\n[17]: The higher T is, the more are we willing to live with neighbours of the other group.\nIn the limit of infinite T the composition of the neighbourhood plays no role for changing\nresidences; in the opposite limit of zero T we never move from happy to unhappy in the\n4\n\n\fSchelling version; and never from a smaller to a larger number of \"wrong\" neighbors in\nthe Ising version. In the Ising version, again one can work with a constant or a fluctuating\ncomposition of the total population.\nIn the Schelling version at finite T , with probability exp(\u22121/T ) we consider moving\nout of a site where we are happy, and we always consider moving out from a site where\nwe are unhappy [8]. If we consider moving, we check empty sites in order of their distance\nfrom us, and accept the new site if we are happy there. Otherwise we accept it only with\nprobability exp(\u22121/T ) if we are unhappy there, and instead continue to look for empty\nsites further away with probability 1 \u2212 exp(\u22121/T ). Then large ghettos are formed though\nvery slowly [8]. Similar results are found in various variants [14].\nIn the Ising version at finite T we have much simpler and clearer definitions and flip\na spin (change the group at one site) with probability 1/[1 + exp(\u2206E/kB T )]. The degree\n\u2206E/J of unhappiness is the number of neighbours of the other group, minus the number\nof neighbours of the same group. Thus, for example, neutral moves [7] are made with\nprobability 1/2, and moves from four neighbors of the own group to four neighbours of\nthe other group only with probability exp(\u22128J/kB T ) at low T . (The proportionality\nconstant J is called exchange energy in physics.) This Ising model shows growth of infinitely\nlarge domains\n(\"ghettos\") for T < Tc and only finite clusters for T > Tc with J/kB Tc =\n\u221a\nln(1 + 2)/2, as is known since two-thirds of a century. Such pictures are also nice for\nteaching [18].\nMore novel Ising simulations [11] took into account the \"learning\": Through education\netc people become more tolerant of others or more similar to others. Thus Meyer-Ortmanns\n[11] showed how at low tolerance T compact ghettos are formed, which dissolve through\nKawasaki kinetics (constant composition of the population) if T is suddenly increased. It\ndoes not matter whether this learning comes from the groups becoming more similar to\neach other (decrease of J) or from both groups increasing their tolerance T : Only the ratio\nJ/kB T enters the simulations. We will return to this learning when dealing with more than\ntwo groups in a Potts-like segregation model [12].\nV.Jentsch and W.Alt at Bonn University's complexity centre suggested to have an\nindividual T (i) for each different site i, and to introduce a feedback: If one sees that all\nneighbours are of the own group, one realizes that strong segregation has happened, does\nnot like this effect, and thus increases the own T (i) by 0.01. If, in contrast, all neighbours\nbelong to the other group, one also dislikes that and decreases the own T (i) by 0.01. Also,\none forgets the tolerance one has learned this way and decreases T (i) at each time step\nby a fraction of a percent. Then [14] depending on this forgetting rate, a spontaneous\nmagnetisation remains, or it goes down to zero, while the final self-organized average T\n5\n\n\fmay differ only slightly in these two cases.\n\n3.2\n\nMoney and random-field Ising model\nRandom-field ising model, h = +- 0.2, t = 400\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\nRandom-field Ising model, h = +- 1.5, t = 400\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\nFigure 1: Large domains (upper part) and small clusters (lower part) for small (0.2) and\nlarge (1.5) random fields, respectively, at T = 1. Field and temperature are measured in\nunits of J/kB . After [20].\nOften, a population can be approximately divided into rich and poor. Starving associate\nprofessors and luxuriously living full professors are one example, but poorer immigrants\nand richer natives are more widespread. Poor people cannot afford to live in expensive\n6\n\n\fhouses, but rich people can. If there are whole neighbourhoods of expensive and cheap\nhousing, then these housing conditions enforce a segregation of rich from poor, and this\nsegregation does not emerge in a self-organised way. The more interesting case allows for\nself-organisation of domains by assuming that each residence randomly is either expensive or cheap, with no spatial correlations in the prices. Does this model lead to spatial\ncorrelations between the two groups, assumed as poor and rich?\nA suitable model is the random-field Ising magnet, where each site of a square lattice\ncarries a magnetic field \u00b1h which is randomly up (expensive) or down (cheap). The\nresulting addition to the energy prefers up spins on the expensive and down spins on\nthe cheap sites. Simulations of the asymptotic behaviour are difficult [19], but are not\nneeded for urban segregation happening in finite times on finite samples [20]. Fig.1 shows\ntwo examples: A small random field allows for large domains, upper part, while a large\nrandom field allows only small clusters, lower part. Sumour et al [20] presented at lower\ntemperatures also a time series of pictures, separating growing from non-growing domains.\nThey also listed a complete 50-line Fortran program.\nThus we see that the personal preferences are balanced by the random field, i.e. by the\nprices of housing; spatial correlations over short distances still exist for moderately high\nfields.\n\n4\n\nSeveral groups, two temperatures\n\nWhile the separation into black and white corresponds to USA traditions, reality often\nmeans the coexistence of more than two major groups (like Hispanics in the USA). Similarly,\nwhile the spin 1/2 Ising model is the most basic and most widespread model in statistical\nphysics, the Potts and Blume-Capel models have generalized it to more than two possible\nstates of each lattice site [12].\nAlso, while equilibrium physics has one temperature T , in the above segregation studies\nwe used T for both the tolerance [17] and the external noise [8]. In reality, these two effects\nshould be described by two independent parameters T1 for tolerance and T2 for noise.\nAnd again the tolerance can be different for different people and can self-organize to some\naverage tolerance through a feedback with the local amount of segregation, as discussed\nabove for two states and one local temperature.\nIf each site i of a lattice carries a variable qi = 1, 2, . . . , Q, it may correspond to Q\ndifferent ethnic groups. For Germany, Q = 5 may represent immigrants from the Iberian\npeninsula (q = 1), from Italy (q = 2), from the former Yugoslavia (q = 4), from Turkey\n(q = 5) and native German tribes (q = 3). The more dissimilar these groups are, the less\n7\n\n\fthey like each other. Thus the energy E or unhappiness is assumed to be\nE=J\n\nX\n\n|qi \u2212 qk |\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the sum goes over all nearest neighbour pairs on a L \u00d7 L square lattice, with helical\nboundary conditions. We measure all temperatures in units of the Potts critical tempera\u221a\nture [2/ln(1 + Q)]J/kB , even though this model does not have a sharp phase transition\nfor Q > 2 [12]; only for Q = 2 is T = 1 at the Curie temperature or segregation point.\nPeople exchange residences with others anywhere in the system (except in their immediate neighbourhood), with Glauber probability 1/[1 + exp(\u2206E/kB T )], thus the number of\nmembers of the Q groups remains the same.\nAs in the above Ising case [11], we allow for learning. Here that means we start at a\nlow temperature 0.5 and with increasing time t we increase T during a learning time \u03c4 to\na higher temperature 2.5 according to\nT (t) = 0.5 + 2t/\u03c4\n\n(2) .\n\nWe measure the amount of segregation through the correlation\nC(t) = hniQ/4\n\n(3)\n\nwhere n is the number of nearest neighbours of the same group and averaged over all sites.\n(Alternatively one can average only over the sites occupied by the central group.) In this\nway, C = 1 for the initial random distribution of people, and the increase of C above unity\nmeasures the amount of segregation.\nThe following picture shows a small configuration at \u03c4 = 0, i.e. when the tolerance is\nimmediately at its maximum final value T = 2.5; hundred sweeps through the lattice were\nmade, and only the central group 3 for Q = 5 is shown.\n\n*\n*\n*\n* *\n*\n*\n\n*\n*\n*\n\n** * *\n* **\n** ****\n** *\n\n*\n***\n* * **\n** ****\n* *\n\n**\n*\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n*\n**\n* * **** ***\n***********\n***\n* ****\n** ***\n***\n*\n** *\n*\n\n8\n\n*\n*\n\n*\n*\n\n*\n**\n**\n\n* *\n**\n*** *\n** *\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n**\n**\n** **\n****\n** * *\n* * *****\n\n*\n**\n****\n\n\f* * **** *\n**\n*\n* **\n*\n***** ***\n*\n* *\n**\n* **\n**\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n*\n**\n****\n*\n* **\n* **\n* *\n**\n* **\n* *\n*\n***\n*\n*\n*\n* *\n** **\n*\n*\n*\n*\n** *\n*\n**\n* *\n*\n* **\n*\n*\n**\n* ***\n*\n*\n* **\n*\n**\n* **\n* *\n**\n*\n****\n*****\n*\n***\n**\n****\n*** *\n***\n*\n**\n** *****\n**\n**\n*\n* *\n* *\n**\n*\n*\n***\n* ****\n**\n* **\n*\n*\n*\n** *\n*\n**\n* *\n* **\n*\n***\n** **\n*\n**\n*\n*\n****\n**\n** **\n**\n* *\n*\n* *\n*\n* *\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* ***\n** *\n** **\n* *\n**\n**\n**\n**\n** **\n**\n** *\n**\n*** *\n*\n**\n***\n* **\n*\n*\n* **\n*\n**** **** ****\n*\n***\n** ** * * ****\n*\n**\n*\n**\n** * **\n* * ***\n*\n*\n** *\n* *\n* *\n*\n**\n*****\n* *\n*\n*\n* *\n** *\n* *\n*\n* *\n**\n*\n*\n*** **\n* *\n*** * **\n* ***\n*\n**\n****\n**\n*\n*\n* * ** *\n* ****\n* *\n* * *\n******** ***\n\n9\n\n*** *\n* * *\n*\n*\n*\n** ***\n* ****\n**\n**\n*\n*** * **\n* *\n***\n*\n**\n*\n**\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n** * **\n**\n*** **\n* **\n**\n*\n**\n*\n*\n**\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* *\n*\n**\n**\n* **\n***\n**\n**\n*\n*\n**\n*\n* * **\n*\n* *\n*\n**\n*\n** * *\n*\n****** *\n*\n* * *** **\n*\n**\n**\n*\n**\n*\n*\n** *\n***\n*\n* * *\n*\n*\n\n*\n*\n\n*\n\n**\n*\n\n*\n**\n**\n*\n\n\f*****\n\n**\n***\n*** **\n**\n*\n*\n** * *\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* *\n**** * **\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* **\n** **\n*\n*\n* *\n* *\n** ** **\n*\n** *\n***\n** *\n*\n*\n** *\n** ***\n**** *\n* **\n*\n**** **** **\n*\n*\n**\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n** * **\n**\n****\n**\n* *\n**\n*\n*\n*** *\n*\n* *\n****\n*\n*** *** *\n***\n*\n* *\n* **\n***\n****\n** ****\n*** *\n** *\n*\n**\n*** *\n******\n*****\n*\n* * *\n*\n* **\n* ** * * *\n****\n**\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n* **** * *\n*\n* *\n*\n*\n* *****\n****\n***** *\n*\n* ***\n*\n* *\n* ***\n* ****\n*\n*\n*** *\n* ** ** ***\n*\n* * **** * * **** **\n*\n* ** *\n**\n** *** ** **** *** ***\n**\n* *\n**** **\n**\n*****\n*** ** ** **\n**** *\n****\n**\n* *\n****\n***\n*\n* **\n**\n**\n*\n*\n** **\n*\n** ** *\n*\n**\n*\n*\n**\n*\n*\n****\n**\n** ***\n***\n*\n** *\n*** *\n*** * ** * *\n* *\n*\n*\n* * ****\n* * ** * ***\n***\n** * *\n**\n*\n*\n******\n*\n*\n*\n* * *\n**\n*\n***\n***\n* ** * *** *\n* *\n*\n*\n* *\n*\n\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n*\n\n**\n**\n**\n\n*\n* *\n\n*\n\nNow we bring the corresponding configuration for much slower learning \u03c4 = 20:\n*\n\n****\n******\n******\n****\n\n** ***\n*** *\n*****\n********\n*\n**\n\n*\n\n** *** ***\n*******\n**\n******\n********\n*\n*\n\n*****\n**\n*\n\n10\n\n***\n*\n*\n*\n\n** * *\n*\n\n\f*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n**\n****\n******\n******\n**\n*******\n* ***\n\n*\n** *\n*** *\n*******\n****\n**\n**\n*\n\n*****\n**\n** * **\n*\n*\n***\n\n*\n****\n**\n\n*\n*** *** ***\n*** *** ******\n**\n***** *******\n**\n*************\n***\n**\n********** ***\n*\n***\n** **\n*\n***\n**\n*\n*\n**\n**\n*\n**\n**\n**\n*\n*\n*\n*\n******\n**\n*****\n****\n**\n*\n****\n**\n***\n*\n**\n* *****\n*\n*****\n*\n**\n****\n*\n*****\n*******\n***\n******\n****** *\n***\n********\n****\n********\n*\n**\n*******\n*\n**\n** *****\n**\n******\n***\n*\n**\n***\n**\n\n11\n\n**\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n\n***\n*\n\n**\n**\n**\n*\n**\n*\n**\n*\n*\n\n*\n*\n*\n***\n**\n*\n** *\n*\n*\n*\n**\n*\n****\n*\n*****\n*\n** **\n*\n*****\n***\n*\n*\n***\n**\n* ***\n*\n********\n*\n***********\n*\n***********\n****\n***\n*******\n** ****\n******\n*\n******\n***\n*\n******\n***\n**\n*\n***\n**\n***\n**\n*** ** *** ****\n****\n*********\n***\n*********\n***\n*********\n****\n* *******\n*\n**\n****\n****\n*\n*\n** *\n\n\f** *\n\n***\n*\n\n***\n\n*\n\n**\n\n*\n\n** *\n*****\n*******\n***\n**\n***\n*\n*\n**\n****\n***\n***\n*\n\n*\n**\n* **\n\n*\n***\n*** ***\n** * ***\n***\n*\n**\n*\n**\n*\n\n*\n**\n**\n**\n***\n*\n** **\n**\n****\n*\n*******\n**\n*******\n*\n******\n*\n**\n*\n***\n**\n** ****\n***\n**********\n***\n************\n*\n\n* **\n*****\n*******\n***\n***\n**\n***\n\n**\n**\n***\n\n**\n**\n*\n**\n*\n* ** *\n*\n******** *\n***************\n****************\n******\n* ***\n*\n****\n**\n*\n*\n**\n*\n***\n*\n*\n****\n**\n*\n**\n**\n***\n*\n**\n*\n**\n***\n*\n*\n**\n**\n*\n***\n*\n* ** *******\n** **********\n***********\n****** *********\n\n*****\n*****\n**\n*****\n**** **\n**** ****\n***\n*\n*\n****\n**\n***\n*\n**********\n***********\n*\n*************\n*\n*\n****** **\n**\n*****\n*\n*\n*\n****\n****\n*****\n****\n*** *\n*******\n****\n* * *****\n*\n**** * ***\n***\n**\n***\n**\n**\n\n*\n\n******\n*******\n************\n**** ***\n\n**\n\nThe second picture shows a clear compactification compared with the first, though the\ndomains grow only slowly to infinity. The situation may correspond more to Cologne,\nGermany, than to Harlem, New York City. More quantitatively, the upper part of Fig. 2\n(plus signs) shows how segregation increases to high intermediate levels if people do not\nlearn fast enough.\nAs promised, now we introduce a second temperature T2 in addition to the T1 = T used\nabove [21].

The plus signs correspond to no noise, the x signs to strong noise T2 = 3.\nthe above Glauber probability determined by the tolerance, or if another random number\nis smaller than the Glauber probability corresponding to the noise T2 . Thus both flips\nhappen more often when the amount of unhappiness decreases more strongly, depending\non exp(\u2206E/kB T1 ) or exp(\u2206E/kB T2 ), respectively. Such simulations were made first by\n\u00d3dor [21] for spin 1/2 Ising models; noise lets the spontaneous magnetisation (= strength of\nlong-range segregation) jump to zero, Fig.4 below. Also for our Q = 5 Potts-like model and\nstrong noise (x symbols in Fig. 2), segregation is strongly reduced, though in a continuous\nway. Fig.3 shows better the dependence on the strength T2 of the noise.\nNow we allow for individual temperatures T1 (i) depending on the lattice site i. As\ndiscussed in the preceding section, at each iteration T1 (i) increases by 0.01 if all four\nnearest neighbours belong to the same group as i, and it decreases by the same amount\n0.01 if none of the four neighbours belong to the same group as i. In addition, at each\niteration all T1 are decreased by a small percentage, i.e. tolerance is slowly forgotten.\nFig.5 shows the resulting correlation C and average temperature T1 for negligible noise\nand various forgetting rates.

The lowest part shows one of the curves for longer times.\nat a forgetting rate of 0.3 percent. Fig.7 shows these results at the end of the simulation,\nt = 1000, against the noise level T2 ; for T2 up to 1 the noise effects are nearly negligible,\nand above T2 = 5 their effects are strong and nearly independent of T2 .\n[For large T2 we omitted the reduction of T1 (i) by 0.01 since otherwise these temperatures became negative. Apparently for Q > 2 the condition n = 0 (none of my neighbours\nbelongs to my group) occurs much more often than the opposite condition n = 4 (all my\nneighbours belong to my group), and thus the previous changes by \u00b10.01 no longer balance\neach other. Thus we used only increases by 0.01 if n = 4, balanced by the overall forgetting\nrate of 0.003.]\nFrom \u00d3dor's simulations, Fig.8 distinguishes between the noise T2 applied to the surface\nsites, to the bulk sites or to both.

However, its right part normalizes the functions by\nthe number of surface and bulk sites, respectively, and then shows that bulk noise reduces\nsegregation much more than surface noise. (Here, \"bulk\" are the sites surrounded by four\nneighbours of the same group, and \"surface\" is the opposite case.)\nThus this section showed that a lot of external noise can perturb the personal preferences\nfor neighbours of the same group. For two groups [21], there is a first-order phase transition\nat some critical noise level; for Q = 5 there is no such sharp transition, neither as a\nfunction of T1 nor as a function of T2 , but noise still can reduce appreciably the strength\n16\n\n\fCorrelations (+) and average tolerance (x) at t=1000\n4.5\n4\n\ncorr., <T1>\n\n3.5\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nnoise\nFigure 7: Correlations at t = 1000, from previous figure, versus noise level.\n1.5\n\n2.5\nsurface\nbulk\nall\nnormalized correlation\n\ncorrelation\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\nsurface\nbulk\nall\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n100000\n\nt\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n100000\n\nt\n\nFigure 8: Noise kB T2 /J = 2.5 applied to surface sites only, to bulk sites only, and to both\n(left part).

This sounds trivial but for zero noise the Schelling and Ising models do\nnot lead to large domains [9, 7, 8, 13]. Thus only small but nonzero noise can produce\nsegregation into ghettos.\n\n5\n\nSummary\n\nThis review and the earlier publications from physicists [10, 11, 12, 7, 14, 21] tried to\novercome the segregation between sociology and physics with regard to the possible selforganisation (\"emergence\") of residential segregation in cities. Besides outside forces like\nracial discrimination, also personal preferences can lead to segregation, as pointed out by\nSchelling [4] through his Ising-like model. Whether this clustering leads to \"infinitely\"\nlarge domains (=ghettos) depends on details. The original Schelling model failed to give\nghettos; with some randomness [9], neutral moves [7], or positive temperature [8] that\ncan be repaired. Nevertheless, the inclusion of empty residences and the search for the\nnearest suitable residence make the Schelling model unnecessarily complicated, and the\ntwo-dimensional Ising model seems to be a suitable simplification, giving infinite domains\nfor 0 < T < Tc .\nSchelling not only asked the right question but also invented a model similar to those\ntypically studied by physicists like the Ising model of 1925. Thus sociologist who like the\nSchelling model should not complain about physics models with up and down spins to\nbe too unrealistic, and physicists studying up and down spins should not claim that they\nbring something very novel to sociology.\nWe thank S.
