The late-time attractors are found for\nthe full 7-dimensional state space and for several interesting invariant\nsubspaces. In particular, it is found that for the particular value of the\nequation of state parameter, \u03b3 = 6/5, there exists a bifurcation line which\nsignals a transition of stability between a non-tilted equilibrium point to\nan extremely tilted equilibrium point. The initial singular regime is also\ndiscussed and we argue that the initial behaviour is chaotic for \u03b3 < 2.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn a recent paper we analysed how tilted fluids affect the general late-time behaviour of cosmological models of Bianchi type [1]. As the asymptotic behaviour\nof all Bianchi models with a non-tilted \u03b3-law perfect fluid are determined [2\u20134],\nthe sensitivity of the non-tilted equilibrium points was checked with regards to\ninclusion of tilted fluids. In this paper, we will consider one of the models in full\ngenerality; namely the Bianchi type VI0 model containing a tilted \u03b3-law perfect\nfluid.\nThe last decades, there have been some investigations of Bianchi models\nwith a tilted fluid [5\u20137]; in particular, type II [8] and type V [9\u201311]. Apart\nfrom these special Bianchi types, the general behaviour of tilted Bianchi universes seems to be poorly understood. The work [1] gave us some hints where\ninteresting behaviour may occur, but a more elaborate analysis is needed in\n\u2217 S.Hervik@damtp.cam.ac.uk\n\n1\n\n\forder to understand the more general behaviour of universes with tilted fluids. More specifically, in [1] it was shown that for the Bianchi type VI0 model\nthere are no stable non-tilted equilibrium points for equation of state parameter\nobeying \u03b3 > 6/5. The value \u03b3 = 6/5 signals the onset of an instability with\nrespect to tilt implying that at late times the peculiar velocities of the fluid is\na major contributor to the cosmological shear. The Bianchi type VI0 is not the\nmost general model but is sufficiently general to account for many interesting\nphenomena. Thus we will assume that the universe contains a \u03b3-law perfect\nfluid (0 < \u03b3 < 2) which in general can be tilted. The state space is thus 7dimensional [2] (compared to the 8-dimensional state space for the most general\nmodels).\nThe dynamical systems approach \u2013 which is the method adopted here \u2013\nrequires that we find all equilibrium points for the system of equations. These\nequilibrium points play a special role in the evolution of the system. Not only\ndo they correspond to exact self-similar solutions to Einstein's equations, but\nsome of them may even serve as attractors for more general solutions. However,\nnot many exact solutions with tilted fluids are known for the Bianchi models.\nSome type II solutions have been found [12], and Rosquist and Jantzen found\nsome type VI0 solutions [13,14]. Here, we will show that the solutions (for 6/5 <\n\u03b3 < 3/2) found by Rosquist and Jantzen are attractors in a four-dimensional\ninvariant subspace of the full state space. However, in the full state space, there\nalways exists an unstable mode. In the full state space, the future attractor for\n6/5 < \u03b3 is an extremely tilted model which is connected via a line bifurcation\nat \u03b3 = 6/5 to a non-tilted equilibrium point. This \u03b3 = 6/5 bifurcation, which\ncorrespond to a one-parameter family of exact tilted solutions, seems to have\nbeen first discussed in a recent paper by Apostolopoulos [15]. However, not\nmuch discussion is devoted to this solution as the solution itself is implicitly\ngiven in terms of a cubic. Here, we have introduced a different parameterisation\nwhich makes it possible to explicitly write down the solution in terms of the\nexpansion-normalised variables.\nWe also discuss the initial singular regime, which is a lot more complicated.\nIn fact, there are indications that the initial singular regime possesses an oscillatory, very likely even a chaotic behaviour similar to that found in other Bianchi\nmodels [16\u201324].\nThe paper is organised as follows. Next, in section 2, we write down the\nequations of motion using the orthonormal frame formalism. In section 3 we\ndiscuss the equilibrium points which are important for the late-time asymptotic\nbehaviour. Then, in section 4, we discuss their stability and present some general\nresults regarding the asymptotic behaviour of the tilted type VI0 model. The\ninitial singular regime is discussed in section 5 before we finally summarise our\nresults in section 6.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nEquations of motion\n\nThe energy-momentum tensor for a tilted perfect fluid is\nT\u03bc\u03bd = (\u03c1\u0302 + p\u0302)\u00fb\u03bc \u00fb\u03bd + p\u0302g\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u00fb\u03bc = (cosh \u03b2, sinh \u03b2ca ) is the fluid velocity. The spatial vector ca is\nchosen to be a unit vector in the tangent space of the surfaces of homogeneity;\ni.e. ca ca = 1. We will further assume that the fluid obey the barotropic equation\nof state,\np\u0302 = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u03c1\u0302,\n\n0 < \u03b3 < 2.\n\n(2)\n\nIn terms of the unit normal vector u = e0 to the group orbits the energymomentum tensor takes the imperfect fluid form\nT\u03bc\u03bd = (\u03c1 + p)u\u03bc u\u03bd + pg\u03bc\u03bd + 2q(\u03bc u\u03bd) + \u03c0\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\n\u03c1\n\n=\n\np\n\n=\n\nqa\n\n=\n\n\u03c0ab\n\n=\n\n(1 + \u03b3 sinh2 \u03b2)\u03c1\u0302,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03b3 \u2212 1 + \u03b3 sinh2 \u03b2 \u03c1\u0302,\n3\n\u03b3 \u03c1\u0302 cosh \u03b2 sinh \u03b2ca ,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n2\n\u03b3 \u03c1\u0302 sinh \u03b2 ca cb \u2212 hab .\n3\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\nFor the Bianchi cosmologies \u2013 which admit a simply transitive symmetry\ngroup acting on the spatial hypersurfaces \u2013 we can always write the line-element\nas\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + \u03b4ab \u03c9 a \u03c9 b ,\n\nwhere \u03c9a is a triad of one-forms obeying\n\n1\nd\u03c9a = \u2212 C abc \u03c9 b \u2227 \u03c9c ,\n2\nand C abc depend only on time and are the structure constants of the Bianchi\ngroup type under consideration. The structure constants C abc can be split into\na vector part ab , and a trace-free part nab by [25]\nC abc = \u03b5bcd nda \u2212 \u03b4 ab ac + \u03b4 ac ab .\n\nThe matrix nab is symmetric, and, using the Jacobi identity, ab = (1/2)C aba is\nin the kernel of nab\nnab ab = 0.\nFor the type VI0 model, ac = 0 and nab has two non-zero eigenvalues with\nopposite sign.

The invariant subspaces\nN \u00b1 N\u0304 = 0 correspond to Bianchi type II universes. Note that, given the\nset (\u03a3\u00b1 , \u03a312 , \u03a313 , \u03a323 , N, N\u0304 ) we can determine \u03a9 from eq. (21), and v 1 , v 2\nand v 3 from eqs. (22), (23) and (24), respectively. We also require 0 \u2264 V \u2264 1\nfor physical reasons (we are not allowing superluminal velocities).

Hence, the state space\ncan be considered a subspace of a compact region in R7 .\n5\n\n\fThere are also some discrete symmetries under which this system is invariant.\nThese are (of course, also compositions of these maps are symmetries)\n\u03c61 : (\u03a3\u2212 , \u03a312 , \u03a313 ) 7\u2212\u2192 (\u2212\u03a3\u2212 , \u2212\u03a313 , \u2212\u03a312 )\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c62 : \u03a312 , \u03a323 , N\u0304 7\u2212\u2192 \u2212\u03a312 , \u2212\u03a323 , \u2212N\u0304\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c63 : \u03a313 , \u03a323 , N\u0304 7\u2212\u2192 \u2212\u03a313 , \u2212\u03a323 , \u2212N\u0304 .\n\n(28)\n(29)\n(30)\n\nTo understand the physical importance of these maps we can apply them to the\nvector v a :\n\u03c61 : (v1 , v2 , v3 ) 7\u2212\u2192 (\u2212v1 , v3 , v2 )\n\u03c62 : (v1 , v2 , v3 ) 7\u2212\u2192 (v1 , \u2212v2 , v3 )\n\n\u03c63 : (v1 , v2 , v3 ) 7\u2212\u2192 (v1 , v2 , \u2212v3 ) .\nHence, these discrete symmetries correspond to different permutation and inversions of the axes. These symmetries are intrinsic to the type VI0 geometry.\n\n2.2\n\nInvariant subspaces\n\nThe invariant subspaces play an important role in the evolution of Bianchi type\nVI0 universes. They are important to study since they are invariant under the\nevolution of the system; i.e. if a point p lie in one invariant subspace, then also\nthe maximal extended evolution of p will lie entirely inside it.\nSome of the physically interesting invariant subspaces are as follows (we will\nalso assume that the boundaries are included):\n1. T (V I0 ): The full state space of tilted type VI0 .\n2. F (V I0 ): The set of fixed points of the map \u03c61 . Given by \u03a3\u2212 = 0, \u03a312 =\n\u2212\u03a313 .\n3. T2 (V I0 ): A Bianchi type VI0 with a two-component tilted fluid. It is\nthe set of fixed points of \u03c62 (or \u03c63 ). Given by \u03a312 = \u03a323 = N\u0304 = 0 (or\n\u03a313 = \u03a323 = N\u0304 = 0).\n4. T1 (V I0 ): Bianchi type VI0 with a one-component tilted fluid. Given by\n\u03a312 = \u03a313 = 0. This is the fixed-point-set of \u03c62 \u25e6 \u03c63 .\n5. B(V I0 ): Non-tilted Bianchi type VI0 . Given by \u03a3\u2212 = \u03a312 = \u03a313 = V =\n0.\n6. T \u00b1 (II): The tilted type II boundary. Given by N = \u00b1N\u0304 . Note that these\ntwo subspaces can be mapped onto each other using \u03c62 or \u03c63 . Because of\nthis, we will in most cases not differentiate between these two invariant\nsubspaces.\n7. B(II): Non-tilted type II. Given by N 2 = N\u0304 2 and V = 0.\n8. B(I): Bianchi type I universes.

Given by N = N\u0304 = V =\n\u03a9 = 0.\n\n3\n\nEquilibrium points of importance for the latetime behaviour\n\nThe system of equations has numerous equilibrium points which correspond to\nfixed points in the evolution of the system. That is, if the state variables are\nwritten as a vector X, and we write the system of equations as\nX\u2032 = F(X),\n\n(31)\n\nthen a point X0 is an equilibrium point if\nF(X0 ) = 0.\nThese equilibrium points usually play a particular role in the evolution of the\nsystem. Not only are they exact solutions, but some of these equilibrium points\nmay act as past or future attractors for the set of solutions. Hence, for example,\nat late times these equilibrium points may be a good approximation of more\ngeneral solutions.\nSome of the physically interesting equilibrium points for the future evolution\nare given below. If some equilibrium points are related via one of the discrete\nsymmetries, permutations, or other gauge symmetries, we only give one of them\nbecause the solutions they represent are equivalent. We also indicate the smallest invariant subspace mentioned in section 2.2 to which they belong.\n\n3.1\n\nNon-tilted\n\n1.

The subspace T \u00b1 (II) was discussed in [8]. We will use these results\nin the following way. Assume we have a subspace, S (given by y = 0, say), for\nwhich a function Z is strictly monotonically decreasing; i.e.\nZ \u2032 |y=0 = \u03b1 Z|y=0 ,\n\n\u03b1 \u2264 \u01eb < 0.\n\nAway from S, we can write Z \u2032 = \u03b1(y)Z where \u03b1(0) \u2264 \u01eb < 0. The function \u03b1(y)\nis continuous in y; hence, there will exist a \u03b4 > 0 such that\n\u03b1(y) < 0,\n\nfor |y| < \u03b4.\n\n(33)\n\nSo suppose the solution curves have the property y \u2192 0, then after sufficently\nlong time the function Z will be monotonic along the solution curves. The late\ntime analysis can therefore to some extent be extracted from the monotonic\nfunctions in S.\nIn the following, \u03c9(p) will mean the future asymptotic set; i.e. for a solution\ncurve c(\u03c4 ) having c(0) = p, then \u03c9(p) = lim\u03c4 \u2192\u221e c(\u03c4 ).\nTheorem 1 (No-hair). For \u03b3 obeying 0 < \u03b3 < 2/3, any p \u2208 T (V I0 ) for which\nV < 1, and \u03a9 > 0 has \u03c9(p) = I(I).\nProof. Part of the proof relies on the observation that the function S = \u03a3ab ca cb\nobeys the bound |S| \u2264 2\u03a3 \u2264 2 (see Appendix A). From the equation for V we\nthus have\nV (1 \u2212 V 2 )\nV \u2032 \u2264 (3\u03b3 \u2212 2)\n.\n1 \u2212 (\u03b3 \u2212 1)V 2\nHence, if 0 < \u03b3 < 2/3, V will be monotonically decreasing.\nThere is also an other monotonically increasing function, namely\n(\u03b2\u03a9)\n\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n[2q \u2212 (3\u03b3 \u2212 2)] (\u03b2\u03a9) ,\n2\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u2261\n\n1\n2 (2\u2212\u03b3)\n\n(1 \u2212 V )\n.\n1 + (\u03b3 \u2212 1)V 2\n\n(34)\n(35)\n\nNote that\n2q \u2212 (3\u03b3 \u2212 2) = 3(2 \u2212 \u03b3)\u03a32 + (2 \u2212 3\u03b3)N 2 +\n\n\u03b3(4 \u2212 3\u03b3)V 2\n\u03a9.\n1 + (\u03b3 \u2212 1)V 2\n\nHence, it follows that for 0 < \u03b3 < 2/3, lim\u03c4 \u2192\u221e \u03a9 = 1, and lim\u03c4 \u2192\u221e V = 0.\nTheorem 2 (Global attractors for T1 (V I0 )). For 2/3 < \u03b3 < 4/3, any\np \u2208 T1 (V I0 ) with \u03a9 > 0, N 2 > N\u0304 2 and V < 1, has \u03c9(p) = C.\nProof. We note that in the subspace T1 (V I0 ) we have\n\u03a3+ = (q \u2212 2)\u03a3+ \u2212 2N 2 \u2212\n\n12\n\n\u03b3\u03a9v12\n.\n1 + (\u03b3 \u2212 1)V 2\n\n(36)\n\n\fSince q \u2264 2 (which can easily be checked) there exist a \u03c41 such that \u03a3+ \u2264 0 for\nall \u03c4 > \u03c41 . Furthermore, in T1 (V I0 ) we also have\nV\u2032 =\n\nV (1 \u2212 V 2 )\n[(3\u03b3 \u2212 4) + 2\u03a3+ ] .\n1 + (\u03b3 \u2212 1)V 2\n\n(37)\n\nHence, for \u03b3 < 4/3, V will be monotonically decreasing for \u03c4 > \u03c41 , and\nlim\u03c4 \u2192\u221e V = 0. This means that the solutions will approach the non-tilted\nsubspace B(V I0 ) in the limit \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. Thus after sufficiently long time, the\nmonotone functions in B(V I0 ) (given in [2]) will also be monotone along orbits\nin T (V I0 ). The point C is an isolated equilibrium point, thus we can use the\nmonotone functions which implies \u03c9(p) = C.\nThere are strong reasons to believe that C is a global attractor in T1 (V I0 )\nfor all 0 < \u03b3 < 2. As evidence for this is the existence of a monotonic function\nin T1 (V I0 ). Define \u03c3 = \u03a32\u2212 + \u03a3223 , which in T1 (V I0 ) has the evolution equation\n\u221a\n(38)\n\u03c3 \u2032 = 2(q \u2212 2)\u03c3 \u2212 4 3N N\u0304 \u03a323 .\nIn T1 (V I0 ) we have the monotonically increasing function:\nZ1 \u2261\n\nN2 + \u03c3\n,\nN\u0304 2 + \u03c3\n\nZ1\u2032 =\n\n4\u03c3(N 2 \u2212 N\u0304 2 )(\u03a3+ + 1)\nZ1 .\n(N 2 + \u03c3)(N\u0304 2 + \u03c3)\n\n(39)\n\nAs \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e there are thus three possibilities:\n\u03c3,\n\n\u03a3+ + 1,\n\nor N 2 \u2212 N\u0304 2 \u2192 0.\n\nIf \u03c3 \u2192 0, the non-tilted analysis can again be applied. The case \u03a3+ = \u22121 is\nunstable in the future so this cannot happen for general solutions. If N 2 \u2212 N\u0304 2 \u2192\n0, the tilted analysis of type II can be applied. All the late-time asymptotes of\nthe type II case have an unstable direction into the interior of T1 (V I0 ) (which\nexactly corresponds to N 2 \u2212 N\u0304 2 ). Unfortunately, for the tilted type II model\nthe local attractors have not been rigorously proven to be global attractors [8].\nApart from these two theorems we have not been able to show any global\nlate time attractors for the various (sub)spaces. However, numerical analysis\nseems to imply that the local attractors also are global attractors.\n\n5\n\nThe initial singular regime\n\nLet us consider the initial singular regime; i.e. where \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. This case is a\nlot more subtle than at late times due to the oscillatory behaviour of the system\nof equations as one approach \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. In fact, the tilted type II seems to have\nan initial oscillatory regime [8], and hence, one would expect a similar \u2013 if not\nmore complex \u2013 behaviour for the tilted type VI0 model.\nIn the following we should emphasise that we consider a non-stiff fluid. For\na stiff fluid (\u03b3 = 2) it has been pointed out that the Bianchi models allow\n13\n\n\ffor a stable past attractor which would remove this chaotic behaviour into the\npast [28, 29].\nIn the study of the initial singular regime it is useful to introduce the variable\n\u03bb, instead of N\u0304 , as\nN\u0304 = \u03bbN.\n\n(40)\n\nThe equations for N and \u03bb are then\nN\u2032\n\u2032\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u221a\n= (q + 2\u03a3+ + 2 3\u03bb\u03a323 )N\n\u221a\n= 2 3\u03a323 (1 \u2212 \u03bb2 ).\n\n(41)\n(42)\n\nIn this case, the invariant subspaces \u03bb = \u00b11 correspond to T (II)\u00b1 . In this case,\nthere are two Kasner circles, which differ by an orientation of frame. They are\nas follows.3\n1. K\u00b1 (II): Kasner \"type II\" (0 < \u03b3 < 2)\n\u03a32+ + \u03a3223 = 1, \u03bb = \u00b11, q = 2\n\u03a3\u2212 = \u03a313 = \u03a312 = N = \u03a9 = 0.\n2. K(V I0 ): Kasner \"type VI0 \" (0 < \u03b3 < 2)\n\u03a32+ + \u03a32\u2212 = 1, \u03bb = 0, q = 2\n\u03a323 = \u03a313 = \u03a312 = N = \u03a9 = 0.\nEach of them also have extremely tilted Kasner sets and corresponding bifurcations. These are discussed in detail in [30]. We will not discuss these here\nas they do not change our conclusion radically. However, bear in mind that\nthese equilibrium points exist and that there are transitions between them.\nThe behaviour near the initial depends on three types of heteroclinic orbits.\nThese are\n1. TRi : Frame rotations.\n2. TN \u00b1 : Taub type II vacuum orbits.\n3. T\u03bb : Frame rotations between K\u00b1 (II) and K(V I0 ).\nLet us consider, for illustration, the Kasner circle K+ (II). The analysis for the\nKasner circle K\u2212 (II) can be obtained from K+ (II) by using the map \u03c62 (or\n\u03c63 ).\n\nK+ (II)\n\nHere, the frame rotations, and Taub type II orbits are given by (when projected\nonto the (\u03a3+ , \u03a323 )-plane):\n1.

Taub type II vacuum\n\u221a orbits:\n\u03a3+ + 1 = C(\u03a323 + 3).\nAll of these orbits maps the Kasner circle onto itself: K+ (II) 7\u2192 K+ (II). The\nframe rotations are illustrated in Fig.2 and the Taub orbits are illustrated in\nFig.3.\nFor the Kasner circle K(V I0 ) there are two frame\nrotations of a similar kind\n\u221a\nas for K\u00b1 (II); namely the ones given by \u03a3+ \u00b1 3\u03a3\u2212 = C\u00b1 . These orbits also\nmaps the Kasner circle onto itself: K(V I0 ) 7\u2192 K(V I0 ).\nIn addition to these homoclinic orbits there are homoclinic orbits between\nthe three types of Kasner circles. They are given by the set of differential\nequations\n\u221a\n\u03bb\u2032 = 2 3\u03a323 (1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )\n\u221a\n\u03a3\u2032\u2212 = \u22122 3\u03bb\u03a3\u2212 \u03a323\n\u221a\n(43)\n\u03a3\u203223 = 2 3\u03bb\u03a32\u2212\n1\n\n= \u03a32+ + \u03a32\u2212 + \u03a3223 ,\n\n\u03a3+ = constant.\n\nA flow diagram for this system projected onto the (\u03bb, \u03a323 )-plane is shown in\nFig.4. We can see that there are homoclinic orbits between K\u00b1 (II) and K(V I0 ).\nHowever, these only form a set of measure zero. Most orbits connect K\u00b1 (II).\nNonetheless, orbits can come arbitrary close to K(V I0 ) and hence, there might\nbe frame rotations within the Kasner circle K(V I0 ) before the orbit go back to\nK\u00b1 (II).\n16\n\n\fFrom this fairly simple, but far from complete analysis, we believe that the\ninitial behaviour of the tilted type VI0 models is fairly complicated. There are\ninfinite sequences of homoclinic orbits which consists of frame rotations and\nTaub vacuum orbits. These orbits are believed to be chaotic in general and\nthus we conjecture that the tilted type VI0 has a chaotic behaviour to the past.\n\n6\n\nSummary\n\nHere, for the first time, we have analysed the late-time behaviour of general\ntilted Bianchi type VI0 universes. Our results are summarised in Table 2. We\nperformed a local analysis and found all the future stable equilibrium points\nfor various subclasses of tilted type VI0 models as well as for the general tilted\ntype VI0 . In particular, we confirmed the observation in [1] on the existence\nof new self-similar solutions for \u03b3 \u2265 6/5. These solutions also proved to be\nimportant for the late-time behaviour; the Rosquist-Jantzen solutions are latetime attractors for a certain class of models with a two-component tilted fluid;\nand the line bifurcation at \u03b3 = 6/5 is, in fact, the late-time attractor for general\ntilted type VI0 solutions. For \u03b3 > 6/5, the late-time attractor is an extremely\ntilted model.4\nIt is interesting to note that the general late-time attactors lie in the fixedpoint-set of \u03c61 . This means that in general the solutions are asymptotically\n\u03c61 -symmetric. More specifically, \u03c61 -symmetric implies v1 = 0, and v22 = v32 .\nAt early times the analysis suggests chaotic behaviour as \u03c4 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. This\nbehaviour seems to be a generic property of tilted Bianchi models [30]. So this\nbehaviour was not very surprising, in particular considering the fact that the\ntilted type II model \u2013 which is part of the boundary of type VI0 \u2013 was known\nto be chaotic [8].\nLet us finish off with some comments about future research and how this\nwork may relate to other Bianchi types. Firstly, the work [1] indicates that\nthere may be some similarities between the more general type VIh models and\nthe type VI0 . Hence, some of the features of the late-time behaviour found in\nthis work may also appear in the type VIh models. As goes for the class VII0\nmodel, which is given by N\u0304 2 > N 2 , there is one obvious difference. The general\nnon-tilted VII0 model is not asymptotically self-similar [31, 32]. This happens\nbecause the type VII0 state space is not compact; there is no upper bound on\nN\u0304 . In the terminology of [33], the type VII0 model is extremely Weyl dominant\nwhile the type VI0 model is Weyl-Ricci balanced at late times. Hence, we would\nexpect a fairly different behaviour for the tilted type VII0 model at late times\nthan that found here. Moreover, in this work the extremely tilted invariant sets\nhave not been emphasised. For example, a two-fluid model where one fluid is\nextremely tilted is if particular interest. Further investigations in this case is\n4 It should be noted that the \u03b3 = 6/5 line bifurcation looks remarkably similar to the\nWainwright \u03b3 = 10/9 line bifurcation of the exceptional model [27]. This makes\nus wonder\n\u221a if\n\u221a\nthere are unknown line bifurcations along the entire line given by \u03b3 = 2(3 + \u2212h)/(5 + 3 \u2212h)\nfor the more general type VIh models [1].\n\n17\n\n\frequired.\nNonetheless, there are quite a few unanswered questions regarding Bianchi\nmodels with a perfect fluid. This work has answered some of them. Hopefully,\nfuture work will answer more of them.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank J.D. Barrow, A.A. Coley and S.T.C.

Thus\nF (X, Y ) \u2264 1.\n\nHence, by identifying X 2 = N 2 and Y 2 = \u03a32\u2212 + \u03a3212 + \u03a3213 , we obtain from eq.\n(44)\n\u00012\n\u00012\n(45)\n4\u03a32\u2212 N 2 + \u03a312 N + \u03a313 N\u0304 + \u03a313 N + \u03a312 N\u0304 \u2264 1.\nThus the last inequality in eq. (27) is redundant.\n\nShowing |S| \u2264 2\u03a3 \u2264 2\n\nWe will consider the function\n|S| = |\u03a3ab ca cb |,\nwhere the matrix \u03a3ab is symmetric and trace-free, and ca ca = 1. This implies\nthat the maximal value of |S| occurs when ca is parallel to one of the eigenvectors\nof \u03a3ab . Thus, if \u03bbi are the eigenvalues, we have\n|\u03a3ab ca cb | \u2264 max(|\u03bb1 |, |\u03bb2 |, |\u03bb3 |).\n18\n\n(46)\n\n\fThe eigenvalues obey the relations\n\u03a3aa = \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 + \u03bb3\n\u03a3ab \u03a3ab = \u03bb21 + \u03bb22 + \u03bb23\n\n=\n=\n\n0\n6\u03a32 .\n\nThese two equations imply that the maximal value of an eigenvalue occur when\n\u03bb1 = \u00b12\u03a3, and \u03bb2 = \u03bb3 = \u2213\u03a3 (or a permutation thereof). Hence, according to\neqs.(46) and (21) we have\n|S| \u2264 2\u03a3 \u2264 2.\n\nB\n\n(47)\n\nEigenvalues of Equilibrium points\n\nIn this appendix we discuss some of the eigenvalues for the various equilibrium\npoints.\n\nB.1\n\nNon-tilted\n\n1. I(I): FRW\n3\n\u03bb1,2,3,4,5 = \u2212 (2 \u2212 \u03b3),\n2\n\n\u03bb6,7 =\n\n1\n(3\u03b3 \u2212 2).\n2\n\n2. CS(II): Collins-Stewart type II (2/3 < \u03b3 < 2)\nThe essential unstable eigenvalue is for all equilibrium points in T (II):\n\u221a\n\u03bb7 = \u22124 3\u03a323 .\nHence, since \u03a323 < 0 this point is unstable.\n3.

R(V I0 ): Rosquist-Jantzen (6/5 < \u03b3 < 3/2)\nDue to the complex character of these solutions, one has to part of the\nstability analysis numerically. Some eigenvalues are possible to find analytically. The following seems to hold:\nRe(\u03bb1,2,3,4 ) = \u2212 43 (2 \u2212 \u03b3),\n\nRe(\u03bb5 ), Re(\u03bb6 ) < 0,\n\u03bb5 + \u03bb6 = \u2212 32 (2 \u2212 \u03b3),\n3\n\u03bb7 = 2 (5\u03b3 \u2212 6).\nHere, \u03bb1,2,5,6 correspond to directions along the invariant subspace T2 (V I0 ).\n4. L(V I0 ): Type VI0 line bifurcation (\u03b3 = 6/5)\nAgain we have to rely on some numerical analysis. However, analytic\ncombined with numerics seem to indicate that\n\u03bb1 = 0,\n\u03bb6 + \u03bb7 = \u2212 56 ,\n\nRe(\u03bb2,3,4,5 ) = \u2212 53 ,\n\nRe(\u03bb6 ), Re(\u03bb7 ) < 0.\n\nHere, \u03bb1,2,3,4,5 correspond to directions along the invariant subspace F (V I0 ).\n\nB.3\n\nExtremely tilted\n\n1. E(II): Extremely tilted type II (0 < \u03b3 < 2)\nUnstable due to the eigenvalue\n\u221a\n\u03bb7 = \u22124 3\u03a323 .\n2.
