I NTRODUCTION\nThe last ten years have witnessed the proposal of numerous practical methods [1], [2], [3], [4], [5],\n[6], [7], [8], [9] for encoding nongenetic information using DNA molecules as a medium both in vitro\nand in vivo. A conspicuous use of these techniques recently took place when Craig Venter's group\nproduced the first artificial bacteria including \"watermarked\" information [10]. All of these information\nencoding proposals hinge on the fact that DNA molecules -which encode genetic information in all living\norganisms, except for some viruses- are conceptually equivalent to sequences of quaternary symbols.\nTherefore DNA data embedding is in essence an instance of digital communications in which channel\nF.

The two broad fields of application of DNA\ndata embedding techniques are: 1) the use of DNA strands as self-replicating nano-memories able to\nstore huge amounts of data in an ultra-compact way; and 2) security and tracking applications for genetic\nmaterial afforded by embedding nongenetic information in DNA (DNA watermarking, steganography,\nand fingerprinting).\nThe most basic information theoretical issue in DNA data embedding is the establishment of the upper\nlimit on the amount of information that can be reliably embedded within DNA under a given level of\nmutations, that is, its Shannon capacity [11]. In this paper we obtain the capacity of DNA data embedding under substitution mutations -which randomly switch the value of bases in a DNA sequence-\nmodelled through a symmetric memoryless channel which was firstly used to study molecular evolution\nby Kimura [12]. The capacity problem can be straightforwardly tackled when no side information is used\nby the encoder. The side-informed scenario requires more attention for reasons that will become clear\nlater, and thus occupies us for the best part of this paper. Some biological implications at large of these\ninformation theoretical results are also discussed. In particular, the non side-informed scenario happens\nto be closely connected to previous studies by May, Battail, and other authors that have tried to apply\ninformation theoretical concepts to molecular biology.\nII. P RELIMINARY C ONCEPTS\n\nAND\n\nA SSUMPTIONS\n\nChemically, DNA is formed by two backbone strands helicoidally twisted around each other, and\nmutually attached by means of two base sequences. The four possible bases are the molecules adenine,\ncytosine, thymine, and guanine, abbreviated A, C, T and G, respectively. Only the pairings A-T and C-G\n\nNovember 8, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f3\n\ncan exist between the two strands, which is why each of the two base sequences is completely determined\nby the other, and also why the length of a DNA molecule is measured in base pairs (bp). According to this\nbrief description, the interpretation of DNA as a one-dimensional discrete digital signal is straightforward:\nany of the two strands constitutes a digital sequence formed by symbols from a quaternary alphabet.\nAs regards the biological meaning of DNA, for the purposes of our analysis it suffices to know that\ncodons -the minimal biological \"codewords\"- are formed by triplets of consecutive bases in a base\nsequence. Given any three consecutive bases there is no ambiguity in the codon they stand for, since there\nis only one direction in which a base sequence can be read. In molecular biology this is called the 5'\u20133'\ndirection, in reference to certain chemical feature points in a DNA backbone strand. The two strands in\na DNA molecule are read in opposite directions, and because of this and of their complementarity they\nare termed antiparallel. Groups of consecutive codons in some special regions of a DNA sequence can be\ntranslated into a series of chemical compounds called amino acids via transcription to the intermediary\nribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule. RNA is similar to DNA but single stranded and with uracil (abbreviated\nU) replacing thymine. Amino acids are sequentially assembled in the same order imposed by the codon\nsequence. The result of this assembling process are proteins, which are the basic compounds of the\nchemistry of life. There are 43 = 64 possible codons, since they are triplets of 4-ary symbols. Crucially,\nthere are only 20 possible amino acids, mapped to the 64 codons according to the so-called genetic code\nin Table I, which will be explained in more detail later. The genetic code effectively implements built-in\nredundancy in terms of protecting protein expression.\nThe genome of an organism is the ensemble of all its DNA. Segments of a genome that can be\ntranslated into proteins through the process described above are called coding DNA (cDNA), whereas\nthose segments that never get translated are called noncoding DNA (ncDNA). A gene is a cDNA segment,\nor group of segments, which encodes one single protein, and which is flanked by certain start and stop\ncodons (see Table I) plus other markers.\nFinally, for each base sequence there are three different reading frames which determine three different\ncodon sequences. The correct reading frame is marked by the position of a start codon.\nThe main assumptions that we will make in our analysis are the following ones:\n\u2022\n\nncDNA can be freely appended or overwritten. Although ncDNA does not encode genes, this\nassumption does not always hold true. This is because certain ncDNA regions act as promoters\nfor gene expression, or are transcribed into regulatory RNA (but not translated into proteins).\nHowever this working hypothesis is valid in suitably chosen ncDNA regions, as proved by several\nresearchers [4], [7] employing live organisms.\n\nNovember 8, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f4\n\n\u2022\n\ncDNA can be freely modified as long as the genetic code is observed. This is the classic standard\nassumption supporting the validity of the genetic code. In practice living organisms feature preferred\ncodon statistics, which, if modified, might alter gene expression (for instance translation times,\namong other effects). Therefore we will also discuss codon statistics preservation in our analysis.\nFinally we must mention that we will only consider nonoverlapping genes (either on the same or\non opposite strands). However overlapping genes are in any case rare occurrences, except in very\ncompact genomes.\n\nNotation. Calligraphic letters (X ) denote sets; |X | is the cardinality of X . Boldface letters (x) denote\nrow vectors, and 1 is an all-ones vector. If a Roman letter is used both in uppercase (X ) and lowercase (x),\nthe two forms denote a random variable and a realisation of it, respectively. p(X = x) is the probability\nmass function (pmf) of X ; we will simply write p(x) when the variable is clear from the context. E[X]\nis the mathematical expectation of X , and H(X) its entropy. Also, h(q) is the entropy of a Bernoulli(q )\nrandom variable. I(X; Y ) is the mutual information between X and Y . Logarithms are base 2, unless\nexplicitly indicated otherwise. The Hamming distance between vectors x and y is denoted by dH (x, y).\nA ncDNA sequence will be denoted by a vector xb = [x1 , x2 , * * * , xn ], whose elements are consecutive\nbases from a base sequence. That is, xi \u2208 X , {A, C, T, G}, the 4-ary set of possible bases. A cDNA\n\nsequence will be denoted by a vector of vectors xc = [x1 , x2 , * * * , xn ] whose elements are consecutive\n\ncodons from one of the two antiparallel base sequences, assuming a suitable reading frame among the\nthree possible ones. Therefore, xi \u2208 X 3 . We denote by x\u2032i , \u03b1(xi ) \u2208 X \u2032 the amino acid into which\n\na codon xi uniquely translates, which is further discussed below. Also x\u2032 = \u03b1(xc ) = [x\u20321 , x\u20322 , * * * , x\u2032n ]\ndenotes the unique amino acid sequence established by xc , usually called the primary structure. Using the\n\nstandard three-letter abbreviations of the amino acid names, we define the set X \u2032 , {Ala, Arg, Asn, Asp,\nCys, Gln, Glu, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Pro, Ser, Thr, Trp, Tyr, Val, Stp}. The subset of codons\n\nassociated with amino acid x\u2032 \u2208 X \u2032 , that is, Sx\u2032 , {x \u2208 X 3 |\u03b1(x) = x\u2032 }, is established by the genetic\n\ncode shown in Table I. The ensemble of stop codons, that is, the stop symbol Stp, is loosely classed as an\n\"amino acid\" for notational convenience, although it does not actually map to any compound but rather\nindicates the end of a gene. We call the number of codons |Sx\u2032 | mapping to amino acid x\u2032 the multiplicity\n\nof x\u2032 . Due to the uniqueness of the mapping from codons to amino acids, see that Sx\u2032 \u2229 Sy\u2032 = \u2205 for\nP\nx\u2032 6= y \u2032 \u2208 X \u2032 , and that x\u2032 \u2208X \u2032 |Sx\u2032 | = |X |3 = 64 since \u222ax\u2032 \u2208X \u2032 Sx\u2032 = X 3 . Finally, an example of a cDNA\n\nsequence may be for instance xc = [[T, A, T], [T, G, C]], which would encode the amino acid sequence\n\nx\u2032 = \u03b1(xc ) = [Tyr, Cys]. The corresponding base sequence would be xb = [T, A, T, T, G, C].\n\nNovember 8, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f5\n\nA. Mutation channel model\nAs mentioned in the introduction, an information-carrying DNA molecule undergoing mutations can\nbe readily seen as a digital signal undergoing a noisy communications channel, which we may term\n\"mutation channel\" in this context. We will only consider herein substitution mutations (also called\npoint mutations), that is, those that randomly switch letters from the DNA alphabet. We will assume that\nmutations are mutually independent, which is a worst-case scenario in terms of capacity. Therefore we are\nassuming that the channel is memoryless and thus accepts a single-letter characterisation; consequently,\nwe will drop vector element subindices whenever this is unambiguous and notationally convenient.\nWe will model the channel by means of the two-parameter Kimura model of nucleotide substitution [12]. This consists of a 4 \u00d7 4 transition probability matrix \u03a0 = [p(Z = z|Y = y)], where z, y \u2208 X ,\nand which presents the following structure:\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\u03a0,\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\n(1\n\nA\n\nC\n\n1\u2212q\n\n\u03b3\n3q\n\n\u03b3\n3q\n\u03b3\n3q\n\u2212 2\u03b3\n3 )q\n\n1\u2212q\n(1 \u2212\n\n2\u03b3\n3 )q\n\n\u03b3\n3q\n\nT\n\n(1\n\n\u03b3\n3q\n\u2212 2\u03b3\n3 )q\n\n1\u2212q\n\u03b3\n3q\n\nG\n(1 \u2212\n\n\uf8f9\n\n2\u03b3\n3 )q \uf8fa\n\n\u03b3\n3q\n\u03b3\n3q\n\n1\u2212q\n\nA\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa C\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa T\n\uf8fb\nG\n\n(1)\n\nFrom this definition, the probability of base substitution mutation, or base substitution mutation rate, is\nq = p(Z 6= y|Y = y) =\n\nX\n\np(Z = z|Y = y),\n\n(2)\n\nz6=y\n\nfor any y \u2208 X , whereas it must hold that 0 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 3/2 so that row probabilities add up to one. The\nparticular structure of \u03a0 aims at reflecting the fact that DNA bases belong to one of two categories\naccording their chemical structure: purines, R , {A, G}, or pyrimidines, Y , {C, T}. There are two\ntypes of base substitutions associated to these categories, which in biological nomenclature are:\n\u2022\n\nBase transitions: those that preserve the category which the base belongs to. In this case the model\nestablishes that p(Z = z|Y = y) = (1 \u2212 2\u03b3/3)q for z 6= y when either both z, y \u2208 R or both\nz, y \u2208 Y .\n\n\u2022\n\nBase transversions: those that switch the base category. In this case the model establishes that\np(Z = z|Y = y) = (\u03b3/3)q for z 6= y when z \u2208 Y and z \u2208 R, or vice versa.\n\nThe channel model (1) can incorporate any given transition/transversion ratio \u03b5 by setting \u03b3 = 3/(2(\u03b5 +\n1)). Estimates of \u03b5 given in [13] for the DNA of different organisms range between 0.89 and 18.67,\n\ncorresponding to \u03b3 between 0.07 and 0.79. This range of \u03b5 reflects the fact that base transitions are\ngenerally much more likely than base transversions due to the chemical similarity among compounds in\nNovember 8, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f6\n\nthe same category, that is, \u03b5 > 1/2 virtually always in every organism, and therefore \u03b3 < 1. However\nmany mutation estimation studies focus only on the determination of q (see for instance [14]), and then\none may assume the simplification \u03b3 = 1 in the absence of further details. We will make observations at\nseveral points for this particular case, which is known as the Jukes-Cantor model in molecular evolution\nstudies. In this situation all off-diagonal entries of \u03a0 are equal, that is, p(Z = z|Y = y) = q/3 for all\nz 6= y .\n\nNote that the mutation model that we have chosen implies a symmetric channel, since all rows (columns)\nof \u03a0 contain the same four probabilities. Among the memoryless models used in molecular evolution, the\nKimura model is the one with higher number of parameters which still yields a symmetric channel. As\nit is well known, this is advantageous in capacity computations and will be exploited whenever possible.\nIn the most general case a time-reversible substitution mutations model may have up to 9 independent\nparameters, and yield a nonsymmetric channel. However according to Li [15] mutation models with many\nparameters are not necessarily accurate, due to the estimation issues involved.\nUnder m cascaded mutation stages we have a Markov chain Y \u2192 Z(1) \u2192 Z(2) \u2192 * * * \u2192 Z(m) , and\n\nmodel (1) leads to the overall transition probability matrix \u03a0m between Y and Z(m) . As \u03a0 = \u03a0T we can\nwrite \u03a0m = V Dm VT , with the eigenvalues of \u03a0 arranged in a diagonal matrix D , diag(1, \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bc),\nwhere\n4\u03b3\nq\n3\n\u0010\n\u03b3\u0011\n\u03bc , 1\u22122 1\u2212\nq,\n3\n\u03bb , 1\u2212\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nand V a matrix whose columns are the normalised eigenvectors of \u03a0 associated to the corresponding\neigenvalues in D, that is\n\n\uf8ee\n\n+1\n\n\u221a\n1\u2212 2\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n1 \u22121\n1\uf8ef\nV= \uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n2 \uf8ef 1 \u22121\n\uf8f0\n1 1\n\n0\n\u221a\n\n0\n2\n\n\uf8f9\n0\n\u221a \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\u2212 2\uf8fa\n\u221a \uf8fa\n\uf8fa.\n2\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n0\n\n(5)\n\nFrom the diagonalisation of \u03a0m it is straightforward to see that the elements of its diagonal all take the\nvalue\n\n1\n4\n\n(1 + 2\u03bcm + \u03bbm ), the elements of its skew diagonal take the value\n\nof its entries are\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n4\n\n(1 \u2212 2\u03bcm + \u03bbm ), and the rest\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03bbm ). Therefore any row (column) of this matrix contains the same probabilities,\n\nas \u03a0m is also the transition matrix of a symmetric channel. From the diagonal elements one can see that\nthe accumulated base substitution mutation rate after m cascaded stages is given by\nq (m) = p(Z(m) 6= y|Y = y) = 1 \u2212\nNovember 8, 2018\n\n1\n(1 + 2\u03bcm + \u03bbm ) .\n4\n\n(6)\nDRAFT\n\n\f7\n\nWhen q > 0, limm\u2192\u221e q (m) |\u03b3>0 = 3/4 but limm\u2192\u221e q (m) |\u03b3=0 = 1/2, because |\u03bc| < 1 for any \u03b3\nand |\u03bb| < 1 when \u03b3 > 0, but \u03bb = 1 when \u03b3 = 0. The behaviour of this particular case is connected\nto the fact that we must have both q \u2208 (0, 1] and \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 3/2] for the Markov chain to be aperiodic\nand irreducible, and thus possess a limiting stationary distribution. From the previous considerations,\nthe limiting distribution -that is, the distribution of Z(\u221e) - is uniform, because limm\u2192\u221e \u03a0m = 41 1T 1.\nWhen \u03b3 = 1 and q = 3/4 then \u03a0 =\n\n1 T\n4 1 1,\n\nand hence every Z(m) is uniformly distributed as in the\n\nlimiting case.\nLastly, under the base substitution mutation model that we are considering, codons undergo a mutation\nchannel modelled by the 64 \u00d7 64 transition probability matrix\n\u03a0 = [p(Z = z|Y = y)] = \u03a0 \u2297 \u03a0 \u2297 \u03a0,\n\nwhere \u2297 is the Kronecker product. This is because p(Z = z|Y = y) =\n\n(7)\n\nQ3\n\ni=1 p(Z\n\n= zi |Y = yi ) according\n\nto our memoryless channel assumption. Trivially this channel is also symmetric. When m mutation stages\nare considered, \u03a0m replaces \u03a0 in (7), since \u03a0m = (\u03a0 \u2297 \u03a0 \u2297 \u03a0)m = \u03a0m \u2297 \u03a0m \u2297 \u03a0m [16].\nIII. C APACITY A NALYSIS\nA. Noncoding DNA\nWe will firstly consider this simple case, which will also establish a basic upper bound to cDNA\ncapacity. As per our discussion in Section II, we are assuming that a embedder can overwrite or append\na host ncDNA strand xb , which amounts to freely choosing the input yb to the mutation channel. Therefore\nin this case the channel capacity is given by Cnc , max I(Z(m) ; Y ) bits/base, where the maximisation\nis over all distributions of Y . For the mutation model considered, this capacity is that of the symmetric\nchannel, in which H(Z(m) |Y ) is independent of the input and uniformly distributed Y leads to uniformly\ndistributed Z(m) . Hence\nCnc = log |X | \u2212 H(Z(m) |Y ) bits/base,\n\nwhere H(Z(m) |Y ) =\n\nP\n\nz\u2208X\n\n(8)\n\np(Z(m) = z|Y = y) log p(Z(m) = z|Y = y) for any y \u2208 X , that is, the\n\nentropy of any row of \u03a0m . Therefore\n\n\u0013\n1\nm\nm\n(1 + 2\u03bc + \u03bb )\n4\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 2\u03bcm + \u03bbm ) log\n(1 \u2212 2\u03bcm + \u03bbm )\n4\n4\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\nm\nm\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb ) .\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03bb ) log\n2\n4\n\n1\nH(Z(m) |Y ) = \u2212 (1 + 2\u03bcm + \u03bbm ) log\n4\n\nNovember 8, 2018\n\n\u0012\n\n(9)\nDRAFT\n\n\f8\n\nAs long as the Markov chain is aperiodic and irreducible then limm\u2192\u221e Cnc = 0. The reason is that\nsince the limiting distribution is independent of Y , then limm\u2192\u221e H(Z(m) |Y ) = H(Z(\u221e) ) = log |X |. It\nis interesting to note that, under aperiodicity and irreducibility of the Markov chain, this zero limiting\ncapacity will also apply to models more involved than (1), such as those in which the channel matrix is\nparametrised by up to 9 independent values. Lastly, we also have that Cnc |\u03b3=1,q=3/4 = 0, since in this\ncase Z(m) is always uniformly distributed.\nAs a function of \u03b3 the ncDNA capacity is bounded as follows\nCnc |\u03b3=1 \u2264 Cnc \u2264 Cnc |\u03b3=0 .\n\n(10)\n\nAlthough it can be shown with some effort that these inequalities always hold true, it is much simpler to\nprove them for the range of interest \u03b3 \u2264 1 and q \u2264 1/2. The latter condition implies that both 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1\nand 0 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 1. For fixed m and q , the maximum (respectively, minimum) of Cnc over \u03b3 corresponds to\n\nthe minimum (respectively, maximum) of the accumulated base mutation rate q (m) . Differentiating (6) we\n\u0001\nobtain \u2202q (m) /\u2202\u03b3 = (mq/3) \u03bbm\u22121 \u2212 \u03bcm\u22121 . Therefore q (m) is monotonically increasing when \u03b3 \u2264 1\n\n(as this corresponds to \u03bb \u2265 \u03bc), and then its maximum in that range occurs when \u03b3 = 1 and its minimum\nwhen \u03b3 = 0.\nThe upper bound can be written as\nCnc |\u03b3=0 = 2 \u2212 h\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1 1\n+ (1 \u2212 2q)m .\n2 2\n\n(11)\n\nNotice that limm\u2192\u221e Cnc |\u03b3=0 = 1, that is, the capacity limit is not zero when \u03b3 = 0 because then the\nMarkov chain is reducible. This case cannot happen in practice since it would imply that transversion\nmutations are impossible, but it illustrates that the higher the transition/transversion ratio \u03b5, the higher\nthe capacity.\nFigures 1 and 2 show Cnc for two different values of q representative of extreme values of the base\nsubstitution mutation range q per replication found in different living beings and different sections of\ngenomes [14]. We observe the validity of the bounds (10) and the limiting behaviours discussed. From\nthese figures we can also empirically see that a rule-of-thumb capacity cut-off point is given by m \u223c\n6/(5\u03b3q).\n\na) Biological interpretations: We would like to point out that expression (8) also gives the maximum\nmutual information between a DNA strand and its mutated version in natural scenarios, independent of\nDNA data embedding procedures. This has sometimes been termed the capacity of the genetic channel\nin studies applying information theory to molecular biology.

The case m = 1 was numerically\nevaluated by May et al. [17], using values of q estimated from different organisms and the Jukes-Cantor\nand Kimura (\u03b3 = 1/2) models. Some authors have also considered the behaviour of capacity under\ncascaded mutation stages, that is, m > 1. Gutfraind [18] discussed the basic effect of cascaded mutations\non capacity (exponential decrease with m), although using a binary alphabet and the binary symmetric\nchannel. Both Battail [19] and May [20] computed capacity under cascaded mutation stages using a\nquaternary alphabet and the Jukes-Cantor model. The first author obtained his results analytically -but\nusing a continuous-time approach rather than the discrete-time approach followed here- and the second\none numerically. The results by Battail are essentially consistent with the ones presented here (similar\ncapacity cut-off point), but the ones by May are not. The capacity plots in [20] (taking the results for\nthe human genome) show a cut-off point of m \u2248 102 for q \u2248 10\u22129 , whereas m \u2248 109 would have been\nexpected according to Figure 2. Considering the extents of geological time, where m can easily reach\n109 and beyond, it seems clear that the results in [20] underestimate capacity for m > 1.\n\nIn any case, none of the aforementioned approaches reflects the capacity increase afforded by a mutation\nmodel allowing \u03b3 < 1. It is possible that the trend towards higher capacity observed as \u03b3 \u2192 0 implies that\nevolution has favoured genetic building blocks which feature an asymmetric behaviour under mutations\n(in our case, pyrimidines versus purines instead of a hypothetically perfectly symmetric set of four bases\nfor which \u03b3 = 1). If this assumption is correct, this symmetry breaking must have occurred early in\nevolutionary terms, since it is widely believed that the current genetic machinery evolved from a former\n\nNovember 8, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f10\n\n\"RNA world\" [21] in which life would only have been based on the self-replicating and catalysing\nproperties of RNA. In the RNA world there would not have been translation to proteins, and therefore no\ngenetic code, and hence information was freely encoded using a 4-ary alphabet almost exactly like the one\nused in DNA. Note that uracil, which replaces thymine in RNA, is also a pyrimidine, that is, in the RNA\nworld Y = {U, C}. With these facts in mind, we may model the maximum transmissible information\nunder mutations in the RNA world by relying on (8), and thus see that the symmetry breaking conjecture\nabove applies to the evolution of RNA from predecessor genetic building blocks. We must bear in mind\nthat single-stranded molecules, such as RNA, are much more mutation-prone than double-stranded ones\nsuch as DNA1 . Therefore smaller values of m would have sufficed for some type of symmetry breaking\nto be relevant in terms of information transmission at early stages of life.\n\nB. Coding DNA\nUnlike in the ncDNA case, embedding information in cDNA is a problem of coding with side\ninformation at the encoder. Given a host sequence xc , the encoder has to modify this host to produce an\ninformation-carrying sequence yc which must also encode the same primary structure as xc according\nto the genetic code. This is equivalent to hiding data in a discrete host under an embedding constraint.\nNevertheless, apart from the trivial difference of using a 4-ary instead of typically a 2-ary alphabet, several\nissues set apart cDNA data embedding as a special problem. In order to illustrate these issues consider\nmomentarily a typical data hiding scenario in which a discrete binary host, that is x = [x1 , * * * , xn ]\nwith xi \u2208 X = {0, 1}, is modified to embed a message m from a certain alphabet. The watermarked\nsignal y = e(x, m) must be close to x, where closeness is usually measured by means of the Hamming\ndistance dH (y, x). Pradhan et al. [23] and Barron et al. [24] have determined the achievable rate in\nthis scenario, assuming that the elements of X are uniformly distributed, using the average distortion\nconstraint n1 E[dH (Y, X)] \u2264 d, and supposing that y undergoes a memoryless binary symmetric channel\nwith crossover probability q . Their result is\nRunif = u.c.e.{h(d) \u2212 h(q)} bits/host symbol,\n\nwhere u.c.e{*} is the upper concave envelope. Similarly, our initial goal for cDNA data embedding is\nobtaining the achievable rate for a fixed distribution of X \u2032 = \u03b1(X) under the symmetric channel discussed\nin Section II-A, in particular when X is uniformly distributed as in the analyses of Pradhan et al. [23]\n1\n\nFor instance, RNA viruses such as HIV are known to exhibit base mutation rates of up to 10\u22122 per year [22].\n\nNovember 8, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f11\n\nand Barron et al. [24]. Furthermore we will also obtain capacity, that is, the maximum achievable rate\nover all distributions of the host X \u2032 .\nThe first important difference in the cDNA data embedding scenario is that average inequality constraints on the Hamming distance -such as the ones used in [23], [24]- are meaningless if one wants\nto carry through to yc the full biological functionality of xc . Instead, since it must always hold that\n\u03b1(yc ) = \u03b1(xc ), one must establish the deterministic constraint\ndH (y\u2032 , x\u2032 ) =\n\nn\nX\n\ndH (yi\u2032 , x\u2032i ) = 0.\n\n(12)\n\ni=1\n\nThis requires that dH (yi\u2032 , x\u2032i ) = 0 for all i = 1, * * * , n.\nThe second distinguishing feature of cDNA data embedding is due to the variable support of the\nchannel input variable. Whereas in discrete data hiding with binary host one always has that yi \u2208 {0, 1}\nindependently of xi , in cDNA data embedding we have that yi \u2208 S\u03b1(xi ) so that the constraint (12) can\nalways be satisfied. Therefore the support of yi is dependent on xi , as codon equivalence is not evenly\nspread over the ensemble of amino acids (see Table I).\n1) Achievable Rate: Since side information at the encoder must be taken into account in the cDNA\ncase, then the achievable rate is given by Gel'fand and Pinsker's formula [25] RcX = max I(Z(m) ; U) \u2212\n\u2032\n\nI(X \u2032 ; U) bits/codon, where the maximisation is for nonnegative values of the functional on all distri-\n\nbutions p(y, u|x\u2032 ) under the constraint dH (\u03b1(y), x\u2032 ) = 0, with U an auxiliary random variable that we\nwill discuss next. Note that RcX represents the maximum achievable rate when the host cDNA amino\n\u2032\n\nacid sequence is distributed as X \u2032 .\nGel'fand and Pinsker showed in [25] that in the maximisation problem above one may assume that\nthe channel input is a deterministic function of the side information X \u2032 and the auxiliary variable U,\nthat is, Y = e(X \u2032 , U). Since the support of Y|x\u2032 must be the set of codons Sx\u2032 corresponding to amino\n\nacid x\u2032 -so that the biological constraint can always be satisfied- then the cardinality of the support\nof U|x\u2032 has to coincide with the multiplicity of x\u2032 , that is, |Sx\u2032 |. The support of U|x\u2032 must actually be\n\nSx\u2032 , because U must also act as a good source code for X \u2032 in order to minimise I(X \u2032 ; U) under the\n\ngenetic constraint, and if the support of U|x\u2032 is otherwise then the constraint cannot always be met. One\ncan now establish Y|x\u2032 = U|x\u2032 without loss of generality, although any permutation of the elements\nof Sx\u2032 is actually valid to define Y|x\u2032 = e(x\u2032 , U). Therefore in the following one may consider that\nY = U, that is, that U is the mutation channel input. Noticing that Sx\u2032 \u2229 Sy\u2032 = \u2205 for x\u2032 6= y \u2032 \u2208 X \u2032 , the\n\ndistribution of U can be put as p(u) = p(u|x\u2032 )p(x\u2032 ) when u \u2208 Sx\u2032 . This discussion on U also implies\n\nthat H(X \u2032 |U) = 0, since given a codon u there is no uncertainty on the amino acid represented, and\nNovember 8, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f12\n\ntherefore I(X \u2032 ; U) = H(X \u2032 )\nSince Y|(x\u2032 , u) is deterministic, from the considerations above we have that the achievable rate for a\nfixed distribution of X \u2032 is given by\nRcX = max I(Z(m) ; U) \u2212 H(X \u2032 ) bits/codon.\n\u2032\n\n(13)\n\np(u|x\u2032 )\n\nAs H(Z(m) |U) only depends on the transition probabilities of the symmetric channel, and as trivially\nH(X \u2032 ) only depends on X \u2032 , (13) amounts to the constrained maximisation of H(Z(m) ).\n\nThere are several cases in which (13) can be analytically determined, which are discussed next. First of\nall, since Cnc |\u03b3=1,q=3/4 = 0 then RcX |\u03b3=1,q=3/4 = 0 for any X \u2032 , because RcX \u2264 3Cnc . Therefore in this\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ncatastrophic case the choice of p(u|x\u2032 ) is irrelevant. Furthermore it can be shown that p(u|x\u2032 ) = 1/|Sx\u2032 |,\n\nthat is, U|x\u2032 uniformly distributed, is the maximising strategy in two situations, which are discussed in\nthe following lemmas.\nLemma 1. If q = 0 then the achievable rate is\nRcX |q=0 = E [log |SX \u2032 |] bits/codon.\n\u2032\n\n(14)\n\nProof: Using the chain rule of the entropy we can write H(U, X \u2032 ) = H(U)+H(U|X \u2032 ) = H(X \u2032 )+\nH(X \u2032 |U). As H(X \u2032 |U) = 0, and as Z(m) = U when q = 0, then the achievable rate is given by\n\nRcX |q=0 = maxp(u|x\u2032 ) H(U)\u2212H(X \u2032 ) = maxp(u|x\u2032 ) H(U|X \u2032 ). We just need to see now that H(U|X \u2032 ) =\nP\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nx\u2032 \u2208X \u2032 p(x )H(U|x ) is maximised when H(U|x ) is maximum for all x , which implies that U|x be\n\u2032\n\nuniformly distributed in all cases. Then H(U|x\u2032 ) = log |Sx\u2032 | and (14) follows.\n\nRemark. Note that (14) is the embedding rate intuitively expected in the mutation-free case. For example,\nif X were uniformly distributed, which would yield X \u2032 = \u03b1(X) nonuniform with pmf p(x\u2032 ) = |Sx\u2032 |/|X |3 ,\nP\n\u03b1(unif)\nx\u2032 |\n\u2032\nthen we would obviously compute the rate as Rc\n|q=0 = x\u2032 |S\n|X |3 log |Sx | = 1.7819 bits/codon, since\n\n|Sx\u2032 | choices are available to the embedder when the host amino acid is x\u2032 . The rate in the uniform case\n\ncan actually be obtained in closed form for every q using the following result.\nLemma 2. If X is uniformly distributed then the achievable rate is\nenc \u2212 H(X \u2032 ) bits/codon,\nRc\u03b1(unif) = C\n\n(15)\n\nenc , max I(Z(m) ; U) and this maximisation is unconstrained on p(u), that is, C\nenc is the capacity\nwhere C\nof the symmetric codon mutation channel.\n\nProof: Since p(u) = p(u|x\u2032 )p(x\u2032 ) when u \u2208 Sx\u2032 , with uniformly distributed X we have that\n\np(u) = p(u|x\u2032 )|Sx\u2032 |/|X |3 when u \u2208 Sx\u2032 . Therefore choosing U|x\u2032 to be uniformly distributed implies\nNovember 8, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f13\n\nthat p(u) = 1/|X |3 for all u. Since \u03a0m is symmetric and a uniform input maximises mutual information\nenc = max I(Z(m) ; U) is achieved in (13).\nover a symmetric channel, then C\n\nenc |q=0 = log |X |3 , observe that the particular case in the previous remark can be\nRemarks.

An interesting insight is also afforded by seeing\n\nthat the three parallel symmetric channels undergone by the bases in a codon are mutually independent,\nenc = 3 Cnc in (15). As H(X \u2032 ) is the lower bound to the lossless\nand hence one can use the equality C\n\nsource coding rate of X \u2032 , expression (15) tells a fact that is intuitively appealing but which is only exact\n\nwhen X is uniform: the cDNA embedding rate is the same as three times the ncDNA embedding rate\nminus the rate needed to losslessly convey the primary structure of the host to the decoder.\nUnlike in the case considered above, the distribution of X in real cDNA sequences (that is, genes) is\nnot uniform. To start with, there can only be a single Stp codon in a sequence that encodes a protein\n(gene). As in many other channel capacity problems, it does not seem possible in general to analytically\nderive the optimum set of pmf's p(u|x\u2032 ) in order to compute the achievable rate RcX corresponding\n\u2032\n\nto a host distributed as X \u2032 . To see why one can pose the analytical optimisation problem and see that\nit involves solving a nontrivial system of |X |3 + |X \u2032 | nonlinear equations and unknowns. However the\nnumerical solution is straightforward by means of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm [26] adapted to the\nside-informed scenario. Such an algorithm has been described by Dupuis et al. [27]. An example of the\noptimal distributions numerically obtained for a particular case is shown in Figure 3.\nA last observation is that, in general, p(u|x\u2032 ) = 1/|Sx\u2032 | turns out to yield a good approximation to\n\nthe exact numerical solution. Note that for distributions of X \u2032 different from the one in Lemma 2 one\ncannot produce a uniform input U to the symmetric channel in order to generate a uniform output Z(m) .\nThis is the case illustrated in Figure 3; nonetheless, note from this figure that p(u|x\u2032 ) does not differ\nexcessively from a uniform distribution for several amino acids x\u2032 . A justification of this behaviour is as\nfollows. Using the fact that conditioning cannot increase entropy, a suboptimal maximisation approach\nP\n\u2032\n\u2032\nis given by maximising the lower bound H(Z(m) |X \u2032 ) =\nx\u2032 \u2208X \u2032 p(x )H(Z(m) |x ) \u2264 H(Z(m) ). This\nP\nrequires maximising H(Z(m) |x\u2032 ) = \u2212 z\u2208X 3 p(z|x\u2032 ) log p(z|x\u2032 ) for all x\u2032 . Observing from Table I that\n\ncodons mapping to the same amino acid share in many cases up to two bases, we can approximate\n\u0010P\n\u0011\u22121 P\n\u2032\np(z|x\u2032 ) \u2248 0 when z \u2208\n/ Sx\u2032 and p(z|x\u2032 ) \u2248\np(z|v)\nv\u2208Sx\u2032\nu\u2208Sx\u2032 p(z|u)p(u|x ) when z \u2208 Sx\u2032 . With\nP\nthis approximation, whenever u\u2208Sx\u2032 p(z|u) is constant for all z \u2208 Sx\u2032 , choosing p(u|x\u2032 ) to be uniform\n\nimplies that p(z|x\u2032 ) is also uniform, which maximises H(Z(m) |x\u2032 ). It can be verified that this condition\nholds for all x\u2032 such that |Sx\u2032 | = 1, 2, 4, which accounts for 16 out of the 21 elements in X \u2032 .\n\nFigures 4-7 present the achievable rates for several distributions of X \u2032 .

We observe in these plots that there is barely a difference in the results\nobtained with the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm and the uniform approximation to p(u|x\u2032 ) that we have\ndiscussed.\na) Codon statistics preservation: If we require that the original codon statistics of the host are\npreserved in the information-carrying sequence, then we must peg p(u|x\u2032 ) to the corresponding distribution of the host. Therefore in this case no maximisation is required, and the corresponding rate will\nbe lower or equal than the one achieved without codon statistics preservation. This type of constraint is\nequivalent to a steganographic constraint in data hiding, since the pmf of the host is preserved in the\ninformation-carrying sequence. A comparison of maximum rates and codon statistics preservation rates\nfor the same genes as before is given in Figure 8. Note that in the uniform case both rates coincide\nbecause of Lemma 2.\n\nNovember 8, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f15\n\nSfrag replacements\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n3\n\n3\n\nBlahut-Arimoto\np(u|x\u2032 ) = 1/|Sx\u2032 |\n\nr\nSe\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nyp\n\nt7\n\nu\n\u03b1(\n\nZ\nf ts\n\nni\n\nf)\n\n1.5\n\nt7\nZ\nf ts\n\n1\n\n\u2032\n\nyp\n\n\u2032\n\nr\nSe\n\n2.5\n\nRcX , bits/codon\n\nRcX , bits/codon\n\n2.5\n\nu\n\u03b1(\n\nni\n\nf)\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\nBlahut-Arimoto\np(u|x\u2032 ) = 1/|Sx\u2032 |\n0 0\n10\n\n1\n\n0 4\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\nCascaded mutation stages (m)\nFig. 4.\n\n\u22122\n\nX (\u03b3 = 1, q = 10\n\nSfrag replacements\n\n7\n\n10\n\n10\n\nEmbedding rate in cDNA for different distributions of\n\nX (\u03b3 = 1, q = 10\u22129 )\n\n)\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n3\n\nBlahut-Arimoto\np(u|x\u2032 ) = 1/|Sx\u2032 |\n\nr\nSe\n2\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nyp\n\n1.5\n\nt7\n\nZ\nf ts\n\nu\n\u03b1(\n\nni\n\nf)\n\nt7\n\nu\n\u03b1(\n\nZ\nf ts\n\nni\n\nf)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nr\nSe\n\n2.5\n\nRcX , bits/codon\n\nRcX , bits/codon\n\n2.5\n\nyp\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\u2032\n\n3\n\n1\n\n8\n\n10\n\nCascaded mutation stages (m)\n\nEmbedding rate in cDNA for different distributions of Fig. 5.\n\n\u2032\n\n6\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\nBlahut-Arimoto\np(u|x\u2032 ) = 1/|Sx\u2032 |\n0 0\n10\n\n1\n\n0 4\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\nCascaded mutation stages (m)\nFig. 6.\n\nEmbedding rate in cDNA for different distributions of Fig. 7.\n\n\u2032\n\n\u22122\n\nX (\u03b3 = 0.1, q = 10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\nCascaded mutation stages (m)\nEmbedding rate in cDNA for different distributions of\n\n\u2032\n\nX (\u03b3 = 0.1, q = 10\u22129 )\n\n)\n\n2) Capacity: It remains the computation of capacity, that is,\nCc = max RcX bits/codon.\n\u2032\n\np(x\u2032 )\n\n(16)\n\nIt is simple to explicitly obtain Cc in two particular cases discussed in Section III-B1.\n\u2022\n\n\u03b3 = 1 and q = 3/4: obviously, Cc |\u03b3=1,q=3/4 = RcX |\u03b3=1,q=3/4 = 0.

Note\n\nthat X \u2032 needs not be deterministic. Capacity is then Cc |q=0 = log 6 = 2.5850 bits/codon.\n\nRemark. A trivial upper bound for any q is Cc \u2264 Cc |q=0 . Since Cc |q=0 < 3 Cnc |q=0 = 6, then\nside-informed cDNA data embedding capacity will not be able to achieve non-side-informed ncDNA\ncapacity for every mutation rate. This is similar to parallel results in side-informed encoding with discrete\nhosts [23], [24] (for uniform side information), and unlike the well-known result by Costa for continuous\nGaussian hosts [28].\nFrom our previous discussion on the value of Cc for two particular cases one may conjecture that a\npmf with support in W \u2032 may be capacity-achieving. The actual capacity-achieving strategy is given by\nthe following theorem:\nTheorem 1. Capacity is achieved by the deterministic pmf of X \u2032 that maximises H(Z(m) ).\nProof: See Appendix A.\nRemarks. Denoting as \u03be \u2032 the deterministic outcome of X \u2032 , it can be numerically verified that \u03be \u2032 = Ser\nmaximises H(Z(m) ) for all \u03b3 \u2264 1, m, and q , and thus Cc = RcSer in these conditions. Some examples of\n\nthe rates achievable with deterministic X \u2032 are shown in Figures 9-12. These figures show that the rates\nusing the linearised approximation given in Appendix A are practically indistinguishable from ones using\nthe Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, whereas the approximation p(u|x\u2032 ) = 1/|Sx\u2032 | is also good but worsens as\nNovember 8, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f17\n3\n\nTrp\n\nTrp\n\n2.5\n\nBlahut-Arimoto\n2.5\n\n2\n\na\nG\n\nly\nPr o\n\nu\nLe\n\nr\nTh\n\n1.5\n\nI le\n\nRc\u03be , bits/codon\n\nAl\n\ng\nAr\n\nr\nSe\n\nStp Val\n\n1\n\nn\nAs Asp\n\ns\nCy\n\nGl\n\nn\nG\n\n2\n\na\nAl\n\nG\n\nly\n\nPr o\n\nLinearised approximation\np(u|x\u2032 ) = 1/|Sx\u2032 |\nu\nLe\n\nr\nTh\nl\nVa\n\n1.5\n\nI le\n\ns\nHi\n\ns\nLy\n\nr\nSe\n\nSt p\n\nn\np\nAs As Cys\n\nGl\n\nn\n\nGl\n\nu\nHi\n\ns\ns\nLy\n\n0.5\n\nPh\n0 0\n10\n\n1\n\nlu\n\n0.5\n\nt\nMe\n\nBlahut-Arimoto\ng\nAr\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nRc\u03be , bits/codon\n\nLinearised approximation\np(u|x\u2032 ) = 1/|Sx\u2032 |\n\ne\n\nPh\n\nr\nTy\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0 6\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\ne\nr\nTy\n\nt\nMe\n10\n\nCascaded mutation stages (m)\n\n7\n\n8\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n11\n\n10\n\nCascaded mutation stages (m)\n\nAchievable cDNA data embedding rates for determin- Fig. 10.

However an intriguing phenomenon which somehow indicates a biological connection\nof these results can be observed in Figures 11-12 which concern achievable rates for sequences encoding\na single amino acid/symbol. The effect is observed for \u03b3 < 1 -that is, the range of \u03b3 in which the\n\nNovember 8, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f18\n\nmodel is more realistic- and consists of a rate droop for two particular values of \u03be \u2032 as m \u2192 \u221e with\nrespect to all other symbols presenting the same multiplicity. The particularity is that these two values of\n\u03be \u2032 correspond to the stop symbol (Stp) and the amino acid Leu, which happens to double as start codon\n\nin prokaryotes. Therefore all stop codons and most of the start codons seem to be less suited to carrying\nextra information (redundancy) when isolated. It is not obvious how to interpret this effect, but one may\nsurmise that these codons might have suffered some type of selective pressure during the emergence of\nthe genetic code which somehow depended on the information theoretical amount studied here. In the\ncase of the stop symbol, this may be due to the fact that it can only appear once per gene, and so it\nmakes for a bad conveyor of extra information beyond its basic function.\nIV. C ONCLUSIONS\nWe have provided an analysis of the embedding capacity of DNA when mutations are modelled according to the Kimura model from molecular evolution studies, and discussed some biological connections\nof these results. A more thorough study would require considering insertion and deletion mutations\n(indels). Although the exact computation of capacity under indels is an unsolved problem in most digital\ncommunications scenarios, some approximations relying on realignment methods from bioinformatics\nmight suffice in this context. Generalisations of the Kimura model may also be considered. Although\nin general they will lead to nonsymmetric channels, these can be numerically handled using the BlahutArimoto algorithm.\nA PPENDIX\nA. Capacity-achieving strategy p(x\u2032 )\nIn order to find the capacity-achieving strategy we need to solve\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f6\uf8f9\nX\n\u2202 \uf8f0\nH(Z(m) ) \u2212 H(X \u2032 ) + \u03bd \uf8ed\np(y \u2032 ) \u2212 1\uf8f8\uf8fb = 0\n\u2202p(x\u2032 )\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\n(17)\n\ny \u2208X\n\nfor x\u2032 \u2208 X \u2032 , with \u03bd a Lagrange multiplier. In the following we will write p(z|x\u2032 ) = p(Z(m) = z|X \u2032 =\nx\u2032 ) for notational convenience. Assuming natural logarithms for simplicity, and using \u2202p(z)/\u2202p(x\u2032 ) =\n\np(z|x\u2032 ), (17) becomes\n\nX\n\nz\u2208X 3\n\n\uf8eb\n\np(z|x\u2032 ) log \uf8ed\n\nX\n\ny \u2032 \u2208X \u2032\n\n\uf8f6\n\np(y \u2032 )p(z|y \u2032 )\uf8f8 = log p(x\u2032 ) + \u03bd,\n\n(18)\n\nfor x\u2032 \u2208 X \u2032 . The solution remains unchanged if we multiply (18) across by p(x\u2032 ). This allows us to see\nby inspection that any extreme of the Lagrangian in (17) has to be deterministic, that is, p(x\u2032 ) = 1 for\nNovember 8, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f19\n\nsome x\u2032 = \u03be \u2032 and p(x\u2032 ) = 0 for x\u2032 6= \u03be \u2032 . Note that this is in agreement with the strategies for the cases\nq = 0 and \u03b3 = 1 with q = 3/4 discussed in Section III-B2. See for instance that a uniform distribution\n\u0010P\n\u0011\nP\n\u2032 ) is not constant\np(z|y\nof X \u2032 cannot possibly solve (18) for all x\u2032 \u2208 X \u2032 , because z p(z|x\u2032 ) log\n\u2032\ny\n\non x\u2032 unless \u03b3 = 1 and q = 3/4, in which case we have shown that capacity is zero for any distribution.\nAccording to the previous discussion, for any capacity-achieving solution it always holds that H(X \u2032 ) =\n\n0, and then we just have to maximise H(Z(m) ) over the ensemble of 21 deterministic distributions of\nX \u2032.\n\nThe computation of Rc\u03be and of the maximising distribution U|\u03be \u2032 can be done using the Blahut-Arimoto\n\u2032\n\nalgorithm, following the discussion in Section III-B1 on the optimal strategy for fixed p(x\u2032 ). Note that\n\u03be \u2032 = Trp and \u03be \u2032 = Met can be ruled out outright, since |STrp | = |SMet | = 1, and then only null rates\n\nare possible in these cases. Then we only need to compute Rc\u03be for 19 amino acids. Also, \u03be \u2032 = Stp can\n\u2032\n\nonly be considered hypothetically, since this symbol can only appear exactly once in a gene.\na) Approximation to maximising strategy: It is also possible to provide a closed-form approximation\nto the maximising distribution U|\u03be \u2032 , which yields a better approximation to the embedding rate than just\nusing the approximation p(u|\u03be \u2032 ) = 1/|S\u03be \u2032 | discussed in Section III-B1. Observe firstly that when X \u2032 is\ndeterministic the situation is equivalent to a non-side informed discrete channel with |S\u03be \u2032 | inputs and\n\n|X |3 outputs, with a transition probability matrix \u039b whose rows are the rows of \u03a0m corresponding to\n\nthe codons associated with \u03be \u2032 . In general this channel will not be symmetric nor weakly symmetric, since\n\nalthough its rows are permutations of the same set of probabilities, its columns are not, and their sum is\nnot constant either. However H(Z(m) |U) is still independent of the distribution of U, and then we only\nneed to maximise H(Z(m) ) to find capacity.
