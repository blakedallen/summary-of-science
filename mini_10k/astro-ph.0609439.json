INTRODUCTION\n\n2. DATA ANALYSIS\n\nStars and stellar systems orbiting the most external\nregions of their parent galaxy are crucial tracers of the\nmass distribution and the formation history of the parent\ngalaxy as a whole. For example, it is well known that\nsubstructures related to accretion events are best preserved in the outskirts of a galactic halo (see, for instance,\nBullock & Johnston 2004, and references therein). In\nthis context globular clusters may serve as excellent tracers of substructures in the outer region of their parent\ngalaxy. For instance, Bellazzini, Ferraro & Ibata (2003)\nwere able to identify the accretion signature of the of the\nSagittarius dwarf galaxy among the globular clusters in\nthe outer halo of the Milky Way.\nAs large substructures are also identified in the nearby\nspiral galaxy M31 (Ibata et al. 2001) it becomes increasingly important to have a complete census of the cluster\npopulation in the galaxy outskirts - still lacking to date\n(see Galleti et al. 2005, 2006) - as well as to collect information about cluster ages, metal content, kinematics, etc. Several groups are currently working on this\nline (Huxor et al. 2004; Bates, Holtzman & Walterbos\n2004), including ourselves (see Galleti et al. 2004, 2005,\n2006). In particular, in Galleti et al. (2005, hereafter\nG05) we reported on the discovery of the outermost\nknown cluster of M31, B514 located at a projected distance of Rp \u2243 55 Kpc from the center of M31, not far\nfrom the galaxy major axis. The integrated photometry and spectroscopy indicates that B514 is likely an old\nmetal-poor globular cluster (G05), however direct imaging, at a spatial resolution sufficient to resolve the system\ninto stars, is the only way to ultimately ascertain the nature of a candidate globular in M31 (see Galleti et al.\n2004, 2006).\nHere we present the first results of follow-up observations of B514 taken with the Wide Field Camera (WFC)\nof the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board of\nthe Hubble Space Telescope (HST), confirming that the\nobject is a genuine old and metal poor cluster lying in\nthe remotest region of M31.\n\nObservations have been carried out on June 10, 2006\n(Prop. Id. GO 10565, P.I. S. Galleti). We acquired three\nimages with the F606W filter, for a total exposure time\nof texp = 2412 s, and three F814W images, for a total\nexposure time of texp = 2418 s. The ACS/WFC camera is a mosaic of two 4096 \u00d7 2048 px2 CCDs, with a\npixel scale of 0.05\u2032\u2032 /px. The pointing was chosen such as\nto have the cluster placed near the center of one of the\nACS/WFC CCDs (Chip 2), while Chip 1 is presumed\nto sample the stellar population in the field surrounding the cluster. Data reduction has been performed on\nthe individual pre-reduced images provided by STScI, using the ACS module of DOLPHOT2 (Dolphin 2000), a\nPoint Spread Function -fitting package specifically devoted to the photometry of HST data. The package\nidentifies the sources and performs the photometry on\nindividual frames taking also into account all the information about image cosmetics and cosmic-ray hits, that\nis attached to the observational material. DOLPHOT\nprovides as output the magnitudes and positions of the\ndetected sources, as well as a number of quality parameters for a suitable sample selection, in view of the actual\nscientific objective one has in mind. Here we selected\nall the sources having valid magnitude measurements in\nboth passbands, global quality flag = 1 (i.e., best measured stars), crowding parameter < 0.3, and \u03c72 < 1.5\nif F606W< 24.0, and \u03c72 < 2.5 for brighter stars (see\n(Dolphin 2000) for details on the parameters). This selection cleans the sample from the vast majority of spurious and/or bad measured sources whithout significant\nloss of information. The magnitudes have been reported\nto the VEGAMAG system following the prescriptions of\nSirianni et al. (2005). For reddening corrections, in the\nfollowing we always adopt AF 606 = 2.809E(B \u2212 V ) and\nAF 814 = 1.825E(B \u2212 V ), from Sirianni et al. (2005).\nThese extinction laws are appropriate for a G2 stars, but\nfor E(B \u2212 V ) \u2264 0.1 they are accurate to within 0.01\nmag for a large range of spectral types (from O5 to M0,\naccording to Sirianni et al. 2005).\nFig.1 shows a section of the combined (drizzled)\nF606W image centered on B514. The exquisite spatial\n\n2 INAF - Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna, via Ranzani 1,\nI-40127, Bologna, Italy\n\n2\n\nSee http://purcell.as.arizona.edu/dolphot/\n\n\f2\n\nGalleti et al.\n\nFig. 1.- B606W image of B514\n\nresolution of the ACS/WFC clearly resolves the object\ninto stars, revealing a beautiful globular cluster with an\nextended halo. We were able to obtain useful photometry\nof individual stars down to a distance of r \u2243 2.5\u2032\u2032 from\nthe cluster center, that we identified at the position of the\npeak in the light profile at xpx = 2084 and ypx = 1021\non Chip 2. In any case the adopted selection criteria\nexcludes from the adopted sample the stars located in\nthe most crowded region of the cluster. In particular the\nadopted sample contains no stars with r \u2264 2.5\u2032\u2032 and only\n44 bright star (over a total sample of 1562 stars in Chip\n1) having r \u2264 5\u2032\u2032 .\n3. THE COLOR MAGNITUDE DIAGRAM OF B514\n\nIn Fig.2 we plot the Color Magnitude Diagrams (CMD)\nof different radial annuli around the cluster center in\nChip 2 (panels a, b and c) and of all the stars detected\nin Chip 1 (panel d). Most of the cluster stars are obviously in the innermost region, hence the diagram of panel\na shows more clearly the main evolutionary sequences.\nThe CMD is dominated by an extended and very steep\nRed Giant Branch (RGB) going from F 814W \u223c 20.5\nand F 606W \u2212 F 814W \u2243 1.1 down to the limiting magnitude level at F 606W \u2212 F 814W \u2243 0.9. A small overdensity corresponding to the RGB Bump (see below) is\ndiscernible at F 814W \u2243 23.8. The Horizontal Branch\n(HB) appears quite extended in color. A sloped band\nof stars crossing the sequence at F 814W \u2243 24.6 and\nF 606W \u2212 F 814W \u2243 0.4 has the typical appearance of a\npopulation of RR Lyrae stars sampled at random phase,\nstrongly suggesting the presence of a significant number\nof such variables (see also Fig.3a, below). The HB is\nclearly well populated to the blue of the instability strip\nwith a possible hint to the presence of Extreme HB stars\nat F 814W > 25.0 and F 606W \u2212 F 814W \u223c 0.0. The\nmere presence of Blue HB stars and RR Lyrae indicates\nthat the cluster is probably older then 10 Gyr. The possible presence of HB stars lying to the red of the instability\nstrip needs a more detailed analysis to be considered in\nthe present context. This, as well as other issues, is demanded to a future, more thorough contribution (Galleti\net al., in preparation, hereafter Pap II).\nThe diagram in panel d shows that the stellar density\nin these extreme regions of M31 is so low that the field\n\nof view of a single ACS/WFI is insufficient to sample the\nevolved population of the M31 halo, hence no clear RGB\nand/or HB sequence can be identified and the degree of\ncontamination of the cluster CMD should be negligible,\nat least for F 814W \u2264 26.0. As a reference, we have\noverplotted in panel d the ridge lines of the RGB and\nHB of B514, derived as in Ferraro et al. (1999, hereafter\nF99). Note that the sky area sampled by the CMD of\npanels a, b and c is \u223c6%, \u223c33%, and \u223c60%, respectively,\nof the area of Chip 1 (CMDs of panel d).\nPanel b of Fig.2 shows that cluster RGB and HB are\nclearly visible out to a radius of > 20\u2032\u2032 , corresponding to\n\u2243 76 pc at the distance of M31 (assuming D = 783 kpc,\nfrom McConnachie, Irwin & Ferguson 2005). A value\nof r = 50\u2032\u2032 is the radius of the largest circle centered on\nthe cluster that is completely enclosed within Chip 2. In\npanel c of Fig.2 we plot Chip 2 stars having r \u2265 50\u2032\u2032 : the\nCMD is too sparsely populated here to establish if cluster\nstars are found this far from the cluster center. While the\ndetailed analysis of the cluster profile will be presented\nin Pap II we already anticipate that a break in the profile\nis clearly detected around the tidal radius of the cluster\n(at r \u223c 20\u2032\u2032 ), suggesting the presence of extra-tidal stars\n(Johnston, Sigurdsson & Hernquist 1999).\n3.1. Distance, metallicity and the RGB bump\nIn Fig.3 we present a series of diagrams illustrating our\nassumptions on distance and reddening, our estimates of\nthe metallicity of B514 and the detection of the RGB\nbump of the cluster:\nPanel a: We assume (m \u2212 M )0 = 24.47, after\nMcConnachie, Irwin & Ferguson (2005), and E(B \u2212\nV ) = 0.1, similar to G05. To check the consistency of\nthese assumptions we compare the BHB of B514 with\nthat of the metal-poor Galactic globular M92 (NGC\n6341). The ACS data for M92 are from the set presented by Brown et al. (2005); here we have reduced\nand calibrated the shortest exposures in a fully homogeneous way to obtain a comparison with B514 as selfconsistent as possible. The reddening and distance modulus of M92 are taken from F99 (column 5 and 8, respectively, of their Tab. 2). The HB morphology of M92\nis sufficiently similar to the B514 one to provide a wide\noverlap in the portion of the BHB that is more suitable to be used as a standard candle, e.g. in the range\n0.2 \u2264 F 606W \u2212 F 814W \u2264 0.35, where the sequence is\nnearly horizontal. The diagram clearly show that our assumed distance and reddening provide a very good match\nbetween the BHB of the two clusters, fully supporting\nour choices.\nPanel b: The RGB ridge line of B514 (already presented in Fig. 2, above) is compared with the RGB fiducials of the Galactic clusters M92, NGC 6752, and 47 Tucanae, taken from Brown et al. (2005), corrected for our\nassumed distance and reddening. The fiducial lines are\nlabeled with their [Fe/H] value in the Zinn (1985) scale,\nfrom F99. Reddening and distance moduli of the templates are taken from F99. The RGB of B514 is nicely\nenclosed between the fiducials at [F e/H] = \u22122.24 and\n[F e/H] = \u22121.54, in good agreement with the spectroscopic estimate of [F e/H] = \u22121.8 provided by G05.\nPanel c: The RGB bump is a well known feature in\nthe luminosity function of the RGB of globular clusters\n(see F99 for details and references). The bump is clearly\n\n\fACS photometry of the globular cluster B514\n\n3\n\nFig. 2.- Color Magnitude Diagrams of different radial annuli centered on the center of the cluster (panels a, b, c,and c). The considered\nannuli sample the following fraction of the area of Chip 2, approximately: (a) 6%, (b) 33%, and (c) 60%, respectively. The fiducial ridge\nlines of the cluster are superposed to the CMD in panel c. Panel d: CMD of all the stars in Chip 1 (sampling the field population) with\nthe cluster fiducial ridge lines superposed (solid lines).\n\nidentified here as a peak in the LF of the RGB of B514,\nat F 606W = 24.62 \u00b1 0.05. RGB stars were selected in\nthe CMD using a color-magnitude window that follows\nthe RGB ridge line, excluding HB stars and field stars.\nA RGB bump brighter than the HB level is typical of\nmetal poor globular clusters.\nPanel d: A theoretical Zero Age HB sequence (with\nZ = 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 and Y=0.245) is superposed to the\nCMD of B514. The sequence is taken from the set by\nPietrinferni et al. (2006), transformed to the ACS system by Bedin et al. (2005), and is corrected for the\nreddening and distance modulus assumed above. As\nexpected, the theoretical ZAHB lies at the faint end\nof the observed HB. We take the ZAHB luminosity at\nF 606W \u2212 F 814W = 0.4 as the fiducial ZAHB level,\nF 606WHB = 25.14. The magnitude difference between\nbump\nthe bump and the HB is \u2206F 606WHB\n= \u22120.62 \u00b1 0.1.\nWe transformed the F606W magnitudes of the Bump and\nthe ZAHB into Johnson-Cousins V magnitudes by using\nthe relation\nV = F 606W + 0.205C 2 + 0.104C + 0.037 (1)\nwhere C = (F 606W \u2212 F 814W ), that we have obtained\nfrom more than 400 stars in common between our ACS\nphotometry of M92 and the set of secondary photometric\n\nstandards in M92 by Stetson (2000). From the obtained\nvalues, Vbump = 24.89 and VHB = 25.25, we compute\nbump\n\u2206VHB\n= \u22120.36 \u00b1 0.12 mag, that can be used as input\nbump\nfor the relations by F99 between \u2206VHB\nand [F e/H],\ncalibrated on Galactic globulars, to obtain an independent estimate of the metallicity from the Bump. From\nEq. 6.2 of F99 we obtain [F e/H] = \u22121.8 \u00b1 0.15, further\nsupporting our previous estimates.\nWe obtain also a preliminary estimate of the integrated\nV magnitude of the cluster, by simple aperture photometry out to r \u2243 14\u2032\u2032 from the cluster center. This aperture\nincludes the majority of the cluster light but, obviously,\nsince the tenuous cluster halo extends much beyond this\nlimit, the derived integrated luminosity should be considered as a lower limit. We obtain F 606W \u2243 15.5 mag and\nF 606W \u2212 F 814W \u2243 0.8, that are converted to V \u2243 15.7\nmag according to Eq. 1. Correcting for distance and extinction we find an absolute V magnitude MV . \u22129.1,\ncorresponding to a luminosity of L & 3.5 \u00d7 105 L\u2299 .\nAll the above analysis confirms that B514 is a genuine,\nvery bright, old and metal-poor globular cluster orbiting\nat a large distance from the center of M31. The case of\nB514 demonstrates that the search for remote M31 clusters is a promising line of research, that may finally lead\nto the assembly of a sufficiently large sample of clusters\n\n\f4\n\nGalleti et al.\n\nFig. 3.- Panel a: comparison between the (blue) Horizontal Branches of B514 (dark dots) and M92 (grey circles), obtained assuming\nE(B-V)=0.1 and (m \u2212 M )0 = 24.47 for B514, similar to G05. Panel b: comparison between the RGB ridge line of B514 (crosses) an\nthose of template Galactic clusters (solid lines) from Brown et al. (2005). From the left to the right the fiducials are M92, NGC 6752 and\n47 Tuc. The corresponding metallicities are labeled on the plot. Panel c: luminosity function of the RGB of B514 presented as a smoothed\nhistogram with step of 0.04 mag and bin of 0.2 mag. The arrow indicates the position of the RGB bump. Panel d: CMD of B514 with the\nposition of the RGB Bump and the ZAHB indicated by arrows. The long-dashed line is the ZAHB model for Z = 0.0003 and Y = 0.245\nby Pietrinferni et al. (2006) in the ACS VEGAMAG photometric system, corrected for the assumed reddening and distance modulus of\nB514. The dashed lines mark the region of CMD which was used to create the luminosity function in panel c.\n\nto allow a deeper insight into the yet poorly explored\noutskirts of our neighbour spiral galaxy.\nWe acknowledge the financial support to this research by Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI) and the Ital-\n\nian Ministero dell'Universit\u00e0 e della Ricerca under grant\nINAF/PRIN05 1.06.08.03.
