Recently, a new implementation of surface solitary waves was proposed [4]\nand experimentally created [5] in nonlinear optics, in the\nform of discrete localized pulses supported at the edge\nof a semi-infinite array of nonlinear waveguides. Twocomponent surface solitons were analyzed too [6], and it\nwas predicted that solitons may be supported at an edge\nof a discrete chain by a nonlinear impurity [7]. Parallel\nto that, surface gap solitons were predicted [8] and created in an experiment [9] at an edge of a waveguiding\narray built into in a self-defocusing continuous medium.\nVery recently, the experimental creation of discrete surface solitons supported by the quadratic nonlinearity was\nreported as well [10]. In these cases, the solitons are onedimensional (1D). In Ref. [11], a 2D medium with saturable nonlinearity was considered, with an embedded\nsquare lattice, that has a jump at an internal interface;\nthere, stable asymmetric vortex solitons crossing the interface were predicted, as a generalization of discrete vortices on 2D lattices [12] and vortex solitons supported by\noptically induced lattices in photorefractive media [13].\nSolitons supported by a nonlinear defect at the edge of a\n2D lattice were also considered [14].\nThe search for surface solitons in lattice settings is a\nnatural problem, as, in any experimental setup, the lattice inevitably has an edge. In this paper, we report new\nresults for surface solitons in semi-infinite 2D lattices. We\nwill first consider straightforward generalizations of localized modes studied previously on uniform lattices, viz.,\nfundamental solitons and two types of dipoles, oriented\nperpendicular or parallel to the surface. Then, we will\nintroduce a novel species, the so-called horseshoe soliton,\nin the form of an arc abutting upon the lattice's edge.\nThe existence, and especially the stability, of such a localized mode is a nontrivial issue, as attempts to find\n\na \"horseshoe\" in continuum media with imprinted lattices and an internal interface (similar to the medium in\nRef. [11]) have produced negative results [15]. We find\nthat, in the semi-infinite discrete medium, a horseshoe\nnot only exists near the lattice edge, but perhaps more\nimportantly has a stability region. For comparison, we\nalso construct a family of the same wave pattern in the\nuniform lattice [which is a form of a stationary localized\nsolution of the 2D discrete nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger (DNLS)\nequation that has not been discussed previously and we\nillustrate how/why it is of interest in its own right]. In\nparticular, we find that this family of solutions is completely unstable in the bulk of the uniform lattice, which\nstresses the nontrivial character of the surface-trapped\nhorseshoes, in that they may be stabilized (for an appropriate parameter range) by the lattice edge.\nThe model of a semi-infinite 2D array of waveguides\nwith a horizontal edge, that we consider below, is based\non the DNLS equation for wave amplitudes um,n (z) in\nthe guiding cores, z being the propagation distance:\niu\u2032m,n + C(um+1,n + um\u22121,n + um,n+1\n+ um,n\u22121 \u2212 4um,n ) + |um,n |2 um,n = 0, (1)\nfor n \u2265 2 and all m, where the prime stands for d/dz,\nand C is the coupling constant. At the surface row,\nn = 1, Eq. (1) is modified by dropping the fourth\nterm in the above parenthesis of Eq. (1) (cf. the 1D\nmodel in Refs. [5]), namely, um,0 = 0 as there are no\nwaveguides at n \u2264 0. Note that, despite the presence of the edge, Eq. (1) admits the usual Hamiltonian\nrepresentation, and conserves the total power (norm) ,\nP\nP+\u221e\n2\nP = +\u221e\nm=\u2212\u221e\nn=1 |um,n | .\n\nStationary solutions to Eq. (1) will be looked for as\num,n = eikz vm,n , where the wavenumber k may be scaled\nto 1, once C is an arbitrary parameter, and the stationary\n\n\f2\nsolution obeys the equation\n(1 \u2212 |vm,n |2 )vm,n \u2212 C(vm,n+1 + vm,n\u22121\n+ vm+1,n + vm\u22121,n \u2212 4vm,n ) = 0,\n\n(2)\n\nwith the same modification as above at n = 1.\nWe will first report results of an analytical approximation for the shape and stability of dipoles and \"horseshoes\", valid for a weakly coupled lattice (C \u2192 0). This\nwill be followed by presentation of corresponding numerical results. Finally, we will briefly discuss the interaction\nof vortices with the lattice's edge.\nII.\n\nPERTURBATION ANALYSIS\n\nAnalytical results can be obtained for small C, starting\nfrom the anti-continuum (AC) limit, C = 0 (see Ref. [16]\nand references therein). In this case, solutions to Eq. (2)\nmay be constructed as a perturbative expansion\nvm,n =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(k)\nC k vm,n\n.\n\nk=0\n(0)\n\nIn the AC limit proper, the seed solution, vm,n , is zero\nexcept at a few excited sites, which determine the configuration.\nBy means of the analytical method, we will consider\nthe following configurations: (a) a fundamental surface\n(0)\nsoliton, seeded by a single excited site, v1,1 = 1 (the first\nsubscript 1 denotes the soliton's location in the horizontal direction), (b) surface dipoles, oriented perpendicular\n(b1) or parallel (b2) to the edge, each seeded at two sites,\nn\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nv0,1 , v0,2\n\no\n\n= {\u22121, 1} , or\n\no\nn\n(0) (0)\nv0,1 , v1,1 = {\u22121, 1} , (3)\n\nand (c) the \"horseshoe\" 3-site structure\nn\no \b\n(0) (0) (0)\nv1,1 , v0,2 , v\u22121,1 = ei\u03b81,1 , ei\u03b80,2 , ei\u03b8\u22121,1 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwith \u03b81,1 = 0, \u03b80,2 = \u03c0, \u03b8\u22121,0 = 2\u03c0. We note in passing that stable dipole states on the infinite lattice were\npredicted in Ref. [17], and later observed experimentally\nin a photorefractive crystal [18]. All the above seed configurations are real, and the horseshoe may, in principle,\nalso be regarded as a truncated quadrupole, which is a\nreal solution as well [19].\nAt small C > 0, it is straightforward to calculate corrections to the stationary states at the zeroth and first\norder in C. Then, the stability of each state is determined by a set of eigenvalues, \u03bb, which are expressed in\nterms of eigenvalues \u03bc of the Jacobian\nto be dePmatrix,\n\u221e\nrived in a perturbative form, M = k=0 C k Mk , from\nthe linearized equations for small perturbations around\na given stationary state [16]. The stability condition is\nR(\u03bb) = 0 for all \u03bb, for the Hamiltonian system of interest\n\nherein (since if \u03bb is an eigenvalue, so are \u2212\u03bb, \u03bb\u22c6 and \u2212\u03bb\u22c6 ,\nwhere the asterisk denotes complex conjugation).\nFor the dipole and horseshoe configurations, (b1,b2)\nand (c), the calculations result in\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\n\u22121 1\n+ O C2 ,\nM(b) = C\n1 \u22121\nM(c)\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\u22124 2 2\n\u0001\n= C 2 \uf8ed 2 \u22121 \u22121 \uf8f8 + O C 3\n2 \u22121 \u22121\n\n(5)\n\n(the matrices for (b1) and (b2) coincide, at this order).\n(b)\n(b)\nFrom here, we obtain stable eigenvalues, \u03bb1 = 0, \u03bb2 =\n\u221a\n\u0001\n(c)\n(c)\n(c)\n\u00b12 Ci + O (C), and \u03bb1 = 0, \u03bb2 = O C 2 , \u03bb3 =\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u00b12 3Ci + O C 2 . Both for the dipoles and half-vortex,\none eigenvalue is exactly zero, as this corresponds to the\nGoldstone mode generated by the phase invariance of the\n(c)\nunderlying DNLS equation. As for eigenvalue\n\u03bb2 , it be\u0001\n2\ncomes different from zero at order O C , and, as shown\nbelow, it plays a critical role in determining the stability\nof the horseshoe structure.\nWe do not consider here the fundamental soliton, (a),\nas its destabilization mechanism is different (and requires\na different analysis) from that of the dipoles and horseshoes; in particular, the critical eigenvalues bifurcate not\nfrom zero, but from the edge of continuous spectrum (see\nbelow).\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nTo examine the existence and stability of the above\nconfigurations numerically, we start with the fundamental onsite soliton at the surface, (a). Basic results for\nthis state are displayed in Fig. 1. At C = 0, there is a\ndouble zero eigenvalue due to the phase invariance. For\nsmall C > 0, this is the only eigenvalue of the linearization near the origin of the spectral plane (R(\u03bb), I(\u03bb)).\nAs C increases, one encounters a critical value, at which\nan additional (but still marginally stable) eigenvalue bifurcates from the edge of the continuous spectrum, as\nmentioned above. With the further increase of C, this\nbifurcating eigenvalue arrives at the origin of the spectral\nplane, and subsequently gives rise to an unstable eigenvalue pair, with R(\u03bb) 6= 0, see Fig. 1. This happens for\nC > 1.41; we note in passing that the results reported\nherein have been obtained for lattices of size 10 \u00d7 10, but\nit has been verified that a similar phenomenology persists\nfor larger lattices of up to 25 \u00d7 25. For comparison, we\nalso display, by a dashed-dotted line, the critical unstable eigenvalue for a fundamental soliton on the uniform\nlattice (as a matter of fact, for a soliton sitting far from\nthe edge), which demonstrates that the interaction with\nthe edge leads to conspicuous expansion of the stability\ninterval of the fundamental soliton.

A surface variant of the relevant structure\nenjoys the company of fewer neighboring sites and hence\nis \"more slowly\" (in parameter space) approaching its\ncontinuum limit, in comparison with its infinite lattice\nsibling.\nDevelopment of the instability of the fundamental surface soliton (in the case when it is unstable) was examined in direct simulations of Eq. (1). As seen in Fig. 1, in\nthis case the excitation propagates away from the edge,\nexpanding into an apparently disordered state. This is\njustifiable as for this parametric regime there is no stable\nlocalized state neither in the vicinity of the surface or in\nthe (more unstable) bulk of the uniform lattice.\nNext, in Fig. 2 we present results for the vertical and\nhorizontal dipoles, (b1) and (b2) (see top left and middle panels of Fig. 2, seeded as per Eq. (3). At C = 0,\nthe dipole has two pairs of zero eigenvalues, one of which\nbecomes finite (remaining stable) for C > 0, as shown\nabove in the analytical form. Our numerical findings reveal that, in compliance with the analytical results, the\ndipoles of both types give rise to virtually identical finite\neigenvalues (hence only one eigenvalue line is seen in the\nleft middle panel of Fig. 2). As seen in the right middle\npanel in Fig. 2, both dipoles lose their stability simultaneously, at C \u2248 0.15. Continuing the computations past\nthis point, we conclude that the vertical and horizontal dipoles become different when C attains values \u223c 1.\n\nb2\n\n1\n\n0.2\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Dynamical features of the fundamental\nsurface soliton. The top left and right panels show, respectively, the soliton's norm, P , and the real part of the critical\nstability eigenvalue, versus the lattice coupling, C. For comparison, the dash-dotted lines show respective quantities for\na fundamental soliton in the uniform lattice. The instability\nis due to an eigenvalue pair bifurcating from the edge of the\nphonon band, that eventually crosses the origin of the spectral plane and becomes real. In the bottom panels, we display\nthe linear-stability spectrum of a single-site soliton, and snapshots of its evolution (contour plots of |um,n |2 ), for C = 1.43,\nslightly above the instability threshold.\n\nb1\n\n1.5\n\n\u22123 \u22121 1 3 5\n1.4 10\n1.2\n8\n1\n0.8 6\n0.6\n4\n0.4\n0.2 2\n\nt=90\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\u22123 \u22121 1 3 5\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Top panels: Vertical (b1) and horizontal (b2) dipoles, which, at C = 0, are seeded through Eq. (3).\nThe top left and middle panels show examples of these dipoles\nat C = 1, and the right panel shows their norms. Middle and\nbottom panels: The same as Fig. 1, but for the configurations\nb1 and b2. The vertical dipole, b1, disappears via a saddlenode bifurcation at C \u2248 2.17. The left middle panel displays\nthe eigenvalue bifurcating from zero at C = 0, the dashed\nline being the\u221aanalytical approximation described in the text,\ni.e., I(\u03bb) = 2 C. The right middle panel shows the onset of\nthe b1 (solid lines) and b2 (dashed lines) instabilities for the\ndipole modes, as found from numerical computations. An example of the spectrum and nonlinear evolution of an unstable\nvertical dipole are presented in the bottom panels, for C = 1.\n\nEventually, the (already unstable) vertical configuration,\nb1, disappears in a saddle-node bifurcation at C \u2248 2.17,\nwhile its horizontal counterpart, b2, persists through this\npoint. Furthermore, there is a critical value of C at which\nan eigenvalue bifurcates from the edge of the continuous\nspectrum. Eventually, this bifurcating eigenvalue crosses\nthe origin of the spectral plane, giving rise to an unstable\neigenvalue pair, with R(\u03bb) 6= 0. The value of C at which\nthis secondary instability sets in is essentially smaller for\nb1, i.e., C \u2248 1.55, than C \u2248 2.61 for b2. We thus conclude that the horizontal dipole, b2, is, generally, more\nrobust than its vertical counterpart, b1. This conclusion\nseems natural, as the proximity to the edge stabilizes\nthe fundamental soliton (as shown above), and in the\nhorizontal configuration the two sites that constitute the\ndipole are located closer to the border.\nNonlinear evolution of unstable dipoles was examined\ntoo, in direct simulations.

(4). The top panels show an example of the\nstructure and its norm as a function of C (black solid curve).\nThe solid curves in the middle panels display the real and\nimaginary parts of the key stability eigenvalues (the dashed\nline in the right middle panel is the analytical approximation\nfor the imaginary part presented in the text). For comparison,\nthe red dash-dotted lines show the same characteristics for a\nfamily of horseshoe solitons created in the uniform lattice. It\nis seen that the latter family is completely unstable, while the\nsame waveform trapped at the edge of the lattice has a welldefined stability region. This is a remarkable consequence\nof the presence of the surface. The bottom panels present\nthe linear instability spectrum of the horseshoe state with\nC = 0.26, and its evolution in time.\n\nconfiguration b1) shown in the bottom panels of Fig. 2,\nthe instability again results in a disordered state.\nProceeding to the completely novel configuration (c)\nof the horseshoe, we note that, because it was seeded at\nthree sites when C = 0, there are three pairs of zero eigenvalues in the AC limit. Above, it was shown analytically\nthat one pair of these eigenvalues becomes finite at order\nO(C), and another at O(C 2 ). Numerical results demonstrate that the first pair remains stable until it collides\nwith the edge of the continuous spectrum, which happens\nat C \u2248 0.25. As mentioned above, the second\neigenvalue\n\u0001\npair, bifurcating from zero at order O C 2 , is critical for\nthe stability of configuration (c). The numerical results\nshow that this pair bifurcates into a stable (i.e., imaginary) one, and, as shown in Fig. 3, the horseshoe remains\nstable up to C \u2248 0.25.\nTo understand the effect of the surface on the stability\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) The supersymmetric vortex cell seeded\nas per Eq. (7). The top left and right panels show, respectively, the real and imaginary parts of the solution and its\n(in)stability spectrum for C = 0.4. The bottom panel displays imaginary and real parts of the stability eigenvalues\nversus C. The solid and dashed lines show numerical and\nanalytical results for small C. For comparison, red dasheddotted lines depict the same numerically found characteristics\nfor a supersymmetric vortex on the infinite lattice.\n\nof the horseshoes, it is relevant to compare them to their\ncounterparts in the infinite lattice, i.e., similar structures\nthat may be created, starting from the AC limit taken\nas per Eq. (4), far from the domain edge. By itself, the\nlatter is a novel family of localized solutions to the DNLS\nequation in 2D. However, the important feature is that,\nthe structure in the bulk of the uniform lattice (unlike the\nquadrupole that may be stable), is unstable for the entire\nfamily of horseshoes [in fact, the O(C 2 ) eigenvalue pair,\nbifurcating from zero at C = 0, immediately becomes real\nin this case, see the corresponding, quadratically growing\ndashed-dotted line in the left middle panel in Fig. 3].\nThus, the horseshoe attached to the surface is another\nexample of the localized mode stabilized by the lattice's\nedge (however, unlike the above example of the stabilized\nfundamental soliton, the dependence of the horseshoe's\nstability on the border is crucial, as it may never be stable\nin the infinite lattice).\nThe bottom panels of Fig. 3 exemplify the evolution of\nthe horseshoe when it is unstable. Unlike the situations\nwith configurations (a) and (b), the unstable horseshoe\ndoes not decay into a disordered state, but rather splits\ninto a pair of two fundamental solitons (with S = 0), one\ntrapped at the surface and one found deeper inside the\nlattice.\n\n\f5\nIV.\n\nSURFACE EFFECT ON THE EXISTENCE\nOF VORTICES\n\nBesides the stabilization effect reported above, the lattice edge may exert a different effect, impeding the existence of some solutions. As an example, we consider the,\nso-called supersymmetric [16], lattice vortex attached to\nthe edge, i.e., one with the vorticity (S = 1) equal to\nthe size of the square which seeds the vortex at C = 0,\nthrough the following set of four excited sites, cf. Eq. (4):\n\nMore specifically, these are: \u03bb = 0 (associated with the\nphase invariance),\n\u03bb = \u00b12Ci (a double eigenvalue pair),\n\u221a\nand \u03bb = \u00b1 32C 3 i (a higher order eigenvalue pair). As\nit can be seen in the figure, already at this distance of\ntwo sites from the boundary, the behavior is sufficiently\nclose to that of an infinite lattice.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[the set on the right-hand side is a translated version of\nthat of Eq. (6)]. Numerically found stability eigenvalues for this structure are presented in Fig. 4, along with\nthe analytical approximation, obtained by means of the\nsame method as above. In all, there are 4 pairs of analytically predicted eigenvalues near the spectral plane origin\n(given the four initial seed sites of the configuration).\n\nWe have demonstrated that properties of fundamental localized modes in the 2D lattice with an edge may\nbe drastically different from well-known features in the\nuniform lattice. In particular, the edge helps to increase\nthe stability region for the ordinary solitons, and induces\na difference between dipoles oriented perpendicular and\nparallel to the lattice's border. Additionally, regular supersymmetric vortices cannot be created too close to the\nborder. Most essentially, the edge stabilizes a new species\nof solitons which is entirely unstable in the uniform lattice, the so-called \"horseshoe solitons\". In that sense,\nthe presence of the surface may produce a very desirable\n\"stability broadening\" impact on a number of different\nsolutions; this may become especially interesting in applications related to waveguide arrays, among other optical\nor soft-matter systems.\nNatural issues for further consideration are horseshoes\nof a larger size, and counterparts of such localized modes\nin 3D lattices near the edge. In the 3D lattice, one can\nalso consider solitons in the form of vortex rings or cubes\n[21] set parallel to the border.\nPGK gratefully acknowledges support from NSF-DMS0204585, NSF-CAREER.
