Synthesis method is a modified root locus\nmethod for fractional-order systems and fractionalorder controllers. In the next section we describe how\nto apply the fractional controller on control systems.\nKeywords: fractional-order controller, fractionalorder controlled system, controller synthesis, control\nalgorithm\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe real objects are generally fractional [17], however, for many of them the fractionality is very low.\nA typical example of a non-integer (fractional) order system is the voltage-current relation of a semiinfinite lossy RC line or diffusion of the heat into a\nsemi-infinite solid, where heat flow is equal to the\nhalf-derivative of temperature [16]:\nd0.5 T (t)\n= q(t).\ndt0.5\nTheir integer-order description can cause significant\ndifferences between mathematical model and the real\nsystem. The main reason for using integer-order\nmodels was the absence of solution methods for\nfractional-order differential equations. Recently, important achievements [1, 3, 6, 8, 13, 15, 18, 19] were\nobtained, which enable to take into account real order of dynamic systems.\nP ID controllers belong to dominating industrial\ncontrollers and therefore are objects of steady effort for improvements of their quality and robustness.\nOne of the possibilities to improve P ID controllers\nis to use fractional-order controllers with non-integer\nderivation and integration parts. For fractional-order\nsystems the fractional controller CRON E [9] has\nbeen developed, P D\u03b4 controller [3] and the P I \u03bb D\u03b4\ncontroller [12, 14] has been suggested.\n\u2217 Department of Informatics and Process Control, BERG\nFaculty, Technical University of Kosice, B. Nemcovej 3, 042\n00, Kosice, Slovak Republic, e-mail: petras@tuke.sk\n\n\u2217\n\nBefore the actual design of controllers for dynamical systems it is necessary to identify these systems [2, 15], and then determine their dynamical\nproperties. The dynamical properties of the system\nunder observation can be expressed mathematically\nand graphically in the form of various characteristics.\nThese characteristics can be determined from the differential equation or transfer function via computation or experimentally by exciting the system from\nthe equilibrium. Computation of the transfer characteristics of the fractional-order dynamical systems\nhas been the subject of several publications, e.g. by\nnumerical methods [3], as well as analytical methods\n[13]. In the synthesis of a controller its parameters\nare determined according to the given requirements.\nThese requirements are, for example, the stability\nmeasure, the accuracy of the regulation process, dynamical properties etc. The check whether the requirements have been met can be done with a simulation on the control circuit model. There are a\nlarge number of methods for the design of integerorder controllers, but the situation is worse in the\ncase of fractional-order controllers where the methods are only being worked out. One of the methods\nbeing developed is the method (modification of roots\nlocus method) of dominant roots [10], based on the\ngiven stability measure and the damping measure of\nthe control circuit.\n\n2\n\nBasic mathematical tools for\nfractional calculus\n\nThe fractional calculus is a generalization of integration and derivation to non-integer order operators.\nThe idea of fractional calculus has been known since\nthe development of the regular calculus, with the first\nreference probably being associated with Leibniz and\nL'Hospital in 1695. At first, we generalize the differential and integral operators into one fundamental\noperator Dt\u03b1 which is known as fractional calculus:\n\uf8f1 d\u03b1\nR(\u03b1) > 0,\n\uf8f2 dt\u03b1\n\u03b1\n1\nR(\u03b1) = 0,\na Dt =\n\uf8f3 Rt\n\u2212\u03b1\n(d\u03c4\n)\nR(\u03b1) < 0.\na\nThe two definitions used for the general fractional differintegral are the Gr\u00fcnwald definition and\n\n\fthe Riemann-Liouville (RL) definition [8].\nGr\u00fcnwald definition is given here\n\u03b1\na Dt f (t)\n\nThe\n\n3\n\nFractional - order closed\ncontrol loop\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n[ t\u2212a\nh ]\n\u03b1\n1 X\nf (t \u2212 jh),\n(\u22121)j\n= lim \u03b1\nh\u21920 h\nj\nj=0\n\n(1) We will be studying feed-back control system with\nunit gain in the feed-back loop (Fig.1), where Gr (p)\nis\nthe controller transfer function, Gs (p) is controlled\nwhere [x] means the integer part of x.

Generally, with increased\n0), K is amplification (gain), Ti is integration convalue of K, control time Tr [s] is decreasing and\nstant and Td is differentiation constant.

If \u03bb = 0 (Ti = 0) we obtain a P D\u03b4\ncontroller, etc. All these types of controllers are particular cases of the P I \u03bb D\u03b4 controller.

This method is based on from poles distribution of the characteristic equation in the complex\nplane (Fig.2).\nValues of dominant roots are designed for the quality requirement of the control circuit. Their significance is, that dominant roots are defined for stability\nmeasure St and damping measure Tl . Under there\n\n2. Design of parameters Td , \u03b4, Ti , \u03bb\nWe define the required stability measure St = r\nand damping measure Tl = \u03c9r . This requirement\nis satisfied by the complex conjugate roots (12).\nWe will similarly use characteristic equation as\nthe classical root locus method [4].
