We study various optimality criteria for quantum observables. Observables are\nrepresented as covariant positive operator valued measures and we consider the case when the\nsymmetry group is compact. Phase observables are examined as an example.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this work we study four optimality criteria applied on covariant quantum observables.\nQuantum observables are described as normalized positive operator valued measures. Covariance means that observables transform in a consistent way under a group operation. For\nexample, phase observables are defined as the normalized positive operator measures on a circle\nwhich are covariant under the phase shifts.\nA quantum observable can be optimal in various ways. There are at least four different ways\nhow optimality can be defined. Namely, an observable can be\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n\n(approximately) sharp\nextremal\npostprocessing clean\npreprocessing clean\n\nIf an observable is (approximately) sharp then for any neighborhood of a point from the set of\npossible measurement outcomes, one can prepare a state such that the probability of getting a\nresult from the neighborhood is (approximately) 1. This reflects the fact that an approximately\nsharp observable does not have intrinsic unsharpness \u2013 spread in the measurement outcome\ndistribution depends solely on the measured state.\nA covariant observable is extremal in the convex set of all covariant observables if it cannot\nbe represented as a nontrivial convex combination of other covariant observables. A convex\nmixture of observables corresponds to a random choice between measurement apparatuses, and\nthus an extremal observable is unaffected by this kind of randomness.\nAfter a measurement of an observable, one may try to process the obtained measurement\noutcome data to get the measurement outcome data of another observable. An observable is\ncalled postprocessing clean if it cannot be obtained by manipulating the measurement outcome\ndata of another observable.\nDate: 2/11/2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCARMELI, HEINOSAARI, PELLONP\u00c4\u00c4, AND TOIGO\n\nAnalogously, a preprocessing clean observable cannot be obtained by manipulating the state\nbefore the measurement and then measuring some other observable. State manipulation is\ndescribed by a quantum channel, which typically loses some information. Hence, a preprocessing\nclean observable is not irreversibly connected to another observable by a channel.\nIn Section 2 we formulate the optimality criteria and derive some general results in the case\nof a compact symmetry group. In Section 3 we focus on the phase observables. The phase\nobservables form an interesting class as there is no sharp phase observable (i.e. projection\nvalued measure). This class is also a rich example for the general investigation on optimal\nobservables, showing various connections and differences between the four optimality criteria.\n2. Optimal covariant observables\n2.1. Basic definitions. In quantum mechanics, observables are represented as normalized\npositive operator valued measures. We shortly recall some relevant basic concepts. For more\ndetails, we refer to [2], [6], [13].\nLet H be a complex separable Hilbert space. We denote by L(H) the set of bounded operators\nand T (H) the set of trace-class operators on H. We denote by O and I be the zero and indentity\noperators on H, respectively. Let \u03a9 be a topological space. We denote by B(\u03a9) the Borel \u03c3algebra on \u03a9.\nDefinition 1. A set function E : B(\u03a9) \u2192 L(H) is an observable if it satisfies the following\nconditions:\n\u2022 O \u2264 E(X) \u2264 I for any X \u2208 B(\u03a9);\n\u2022 E(\u03a9) = I; P\n\u2022 E(\u222ai Xi ) = i E(Xi ) for any sequence {Xi } of disjoint Borel sets, the sum converging\nin the weak operator topology.\nThe set \u03a9 is called the outcome set of E.\nTwo observables E and F are called equivalent, and denoted E \u223c F, if there exists a unitary\noperator W \u2208 L(H) such that F(X) = W E(X)W \u2217 for all X \u2208 B(\u03a9).\nStates of a quantum system are described by (and identified with) positive trace class operators of trace 1. We denote by S(H) the convex set of all states. If E is an observable and \u033a is\na state, then the trace formula\npE\u033a (X) := tr [\u033aE(X)] ,\n\nX \u2208 B(\u03a9),\n\ndefines a probability measure pE\u033a on B(\u03a9). The number pE\u033a (X) is interpreted as the probability\nof getting a measurement outcome x belonging to X, when the system is in the state \u033a and the\nobservable E is measured.\nThere is also an equivalent description of observables which we need later. Namely, an\nobservable E determines a mapping \u0398E from the set of states S(H) into the set of probability\nmeasures M1+ (\u03a9),\n\u033a 7\u2192 \u0398E (\u033a) := pE\u033a .\n\n\fOPTIMAL PHASE OBSERVABLES\n\n3\n\nThe mapping \u0398E is affine, i.e., it maps convex combinations of states to convex combinations\nof corresponding probability measures.\nIn this paper we study observables which have a specific symmetry property, called covariance.\nTo formulate this concept, let G be a topological group. For simplicity, here we consider only\nthe case where G is the symmetry group and also the outcome space. (This corresponds to the\nsituation when the symmetry group acts transitively on the outcome space \u03a9 and the stability\nsubgroup is the trivial one element group consisting of the identity element e only.) By a\nunitary representation of G we mean a strongly continuous group homomorphism from G to\nthe group U(H) of unitary operators in a Hilbert space H.\nDefinition 2. Let U be a unitary representation of G in a Hilbert space H. An observable\nE : B(G) \u2192 L(H) is covariant with respect to U (or U-covariant, for short) if\nU(g)E(X)U(g)\u2217 = E(gX)\nfor all g \u2208 G and X \u2208 B(G).\nTwo U-covariant observables E and F are called U-equivalent, and denoted E \u223cU F, if there\nexists a unitary operator W \u2208 L(H) such that U(g)W = W U(g) for all g \u2208 G and F(X) =\nW E(X)W \u2217 for all X \u2208 B(G).\nCovariance of observables arises in many different situations; we refer to [2], [11] for many\nexamples. Trivially, for two U-covariant observables E and F, the equivalence E \u223cU F implies\nthat E \u223c F but, as we will show later (see Proposition 10), E \u223c F does not necessarily imply\nthat E \u223cU F.\nIn the rest of this paper, G is a compact topological group which is Hausdorff and satisfies\nthe second axiom of countability. We denote by \u03bc the Haar measure of G, normalized so that\n\u03bc(G) = 1. We fix a unitary representation U of G, and the set of all U-covariant observables is\ndenoted by O.\n2.2. Approximately sharp observables. Suppose for a moment that E : B(G) \u2192 L(H) is\na projection valued observable, also called a sharp observable. Then for any X \u2208 B(G) with\nE(X) 6= O, we can choose a (pure) state \u033a \u2208 S(H) such that tr [\u033aE(X)] = 1. This means that\nwe can prepare the system in a state \u033a such that the probability of getting an outcome x \u2208 X\nis 1.\nThis property of sharp observables is a simple consequence of the fact that each non-zero\noperator E(X) has eigenvalue 1. Especially, kE(X)k = 1. This gives a useful generalization of\nsharp observables [9],[13].\nDefinition 3. An observable E : B(G) \u2192 L(H) is approximately sharp if kE(X)k = 1 for every\nopen set X \u2286 G such that E(X) 6= O.\nLet us first note that the condition kE(X)k = 1 does not imply that tr [\u033aE(X)] = 1 for some\nstate \u033a. Indeed, kE(X)k = 1 means that 1 is in the spectrum of E(X) but 1 need not be an\neigenvalue. The condition kE(X)k = 1 is equivalent to the fact that there exists a sequence\n\n\f4\n\nCARMELI, HEINOSAARI, PELLONP\u00c4\u00c4, AND TOIGO\n\n{\u033an }n\u2208N of (pure) states such that\nlim tr [\u033an E(X)] = 1 .\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nTherefore, approximate sharpness means that we can prepare the system in a state \u033an such\nthat the probability of getting an outcome from X is arbitrarily close to 1.\nNow, assume that E is a U-covariant observable. Then E(X) = O if and only if \u03bc(X) = 0;\nsee [9]. On the other hand, \u03bc(X) > 0 for any (non-empty) open set X \u2286 G. Thus, E is\napproximately sharp if kE(X)k = 1 for every open set X \u2286 G, X 6= \u2205.\nProposition 1. Let E, F \u2208 O and E \u223c F. If E is approximately sharp, then also F is such.\nProof. Since E \u223c F, there is a unitary operator W such that F(X) = W E(X)W \u2217 for every\nX \u2208 B(G). This implies that the operator norms of E(X) and F(X) are the same, i.e., kF(X)k =\nkW E(X)W \u2217k = kE(X)k.\n\u0003\nUntil now, it may seem that the concept of an approximately sharp observable is quite\nartificial. The usefulness and importance of this concept becomes evident in the situations when\nthere are no sharp observables in the set O, but there exist approximately sharp observables\nin O. This is the case for phase observables, which we will study in Section 3.\n2.3. Extremal observables. The set of all U-covariant observables O is convex, and we denote\nby Ext O the set of extremal elements of O. A convex mixture of two observables corresponds to\na random choice or fluctuation between two measurement apparatuses. An extremal observable\nthus describes an observable which is unaffected by this kind of randomness.\nIn our earlier article [3] we have characterized the extremal observables in O. We do not\nreproduce this characterization here but we use it in the special case of phase observables in\nSection 3.5. Extremality and approximate sharpness have the following simple connection.\nProposition 2. Let E, E1 , E2 be three observables and assume that E is a convex combination\nof E1 and E2 . If E is approximately sharp, then also E1 and E2 are approximately sharp.\nProof. Let X \u2286 G be an open set. As E is a convex combination of E1 and E2 , we have\nE(X) = \u03bbE1 (X) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)E2 (X) for some 0 < \u03bb < 1. By the triangle inequality, we get\nkE(X)k \u2264 \u03bb kE1 (X)k + (1 \u2212 \u03bb) kE2 (X)k \u2264 1 .\nThus, if kE(X)k = 1, then kE1 (X)k = kE2 (X)k = 1.\n\n\u0003\n\n2.4. Postprocessing. Let M1+ (G) be the convex set of probability measures on B(G). As we\nearlier discussed, each observable E defined on B(G) determines an affine mapping \u0398E from\nS(H) to M1+ (G).\nDefinition 4. Let E, F \u2208 O. We say that F is a postprocessing of E, and denote F 4post E, if\nthere exists an affine mapping \u03a8 : M1+ (G) \u2192 M1+ (G) such that\n(1)\n\n\u0398F = \u03a8 \u25e6 \u0398E .\n\n\fOPTIMAL PHASE OBSERVABLES\n\n5\npost\n\nThe relation 4post on O is reflexive and transitive, thus a preorder. We denote by \u223c the\npost\ninduced equivalence relation, i.e., E \u223c F if and only if F 4post E 4post F.\n\nDefinition 5. An observable E \u2208 O is postprocessing clean in O if for every F \u2208 O, the\nfollowing implication holds:\npost\n\nE 4post F \u21d2 E \u223c F .\n\n(2)\n\nThe postprocessing relation and postprocessing cleaness have been studied in [1], [6], [8], [15],\n[21]. Some connections with the convex structure of the set of observables and the postprocessing relation were proved in [14]. In the following we derive some results for the postprocessing\nrelation in the case of covariant observables.\nFor each probability measure \u03bd on G, we define a mapping \u03a8\u03bd : M1+ (G) \u2192 M1+ (G) by\n\u03a8\u03bd (p) = \u03bd \u2217 p .\n\n(3)\n\nHere \u03bd \u2217 p denotes the convolution of these measures, i.e.,\nZ\n(\u03bd \u2217 p)(X) = \u03bd(g \u22121 X) dp(g) , X \u2208 B(G) .\n\nFor E \u2208 O and \u03bd \u2208 M1+ (G), we denote by E\u03bd the observable corresponding to the affine mapping\n\u03a8\u03bd \u25e6 \u0398E . In other words, E\u03bd is the observable defined by formula\nZ\n(4)\nE\u03bd (X) = \u03bd(g \u22121 X) dE(g) , X \u2208 B(G) .\n\nBy its definition, E\u03bd is a postprocessing of E. It is straightforward to check that the U-covariance\nof E implies that also E\u03bd is U-covariant.\n\nProposition 3. Let E, F \u2208 O. The following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) F 4post E .\n(ii) There is a probability measure \u03bd such that F = E\u03bd .\nProof. As explained previously, (ii) implies (i).\nConversely, suppose \u03a8 : M1+ (G) \u2192 M1+ (G) is an affine mapping such that Eq. (1) holds.

Therefore, fn (x) d(\u03a8\u0306m)(x) \u2191 1 by\ndominated convergence theorem, thus showing that \u03a8\u0306m \u2208 M1+ (G).\nClearly, \u039bg \u03a8\u0306m = \u03a8\u0306\u039bg m for all m \u2208 L1 (G). In particular, the map g 7\u2192 \u039bg \u03a8\u0306m is continuous,\nhence \u03a8\u0306m \u2208 L1 (G) by Theorem 1.6 in [24] (which is unaltered even if G is not Abelian). By a\nresult of Wendel [26], there exists \u03bd \u2208 M1+ (G) such that \u03a8\u0306(\u03c6) = \u03bd \u2217 \u03c6 for all \u03c6 \u2208 L1 (G).\nSince \u0398E (S(H)), \u0398F (S(H)) \u2286 L1 (G) (see e.g. [9]), and \u039bg \u0398F = \u03a8\u039bg \u0398E by covariance of E\nand F, we have \u0398F = \u03a8\u0306 \u25e6 \u0398E . We conclude that F = E\u03bd , and thus, (i) implies (ii).\n\u0003\nLet the probability measure \u03bd in (4) be the Dirac measure \u03b4x in some point x \u2208 G. In this\ncase, the corresponding observable E\u03b4x has the form\n(5)\n\nE\u03b4x (X) = E(Xx\u22121 ) \u2261 Ex (X) .\n\nThis observable, which we denote by Ex , is therefore just a translated version of E. It is clear\npost\nthat E \u223c Ex . If G is an Abelian group, then Ex (X) = E(x\u22121 X) = U(x\u22121 )E(X)U(x) and\ntherefore Ex \u223cU E.\nProposition 4. Let E \u2208 O and \u03bd \u2208 M1+ (G). The following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) E\u03bd is approximately sharp.\n(ii) E is approximately sharp and \u03bd = \u03b4x for some x \u2208 G (i.e. E\u03bd = Ex ).\n\n\fOPTIMAL PHASE OBSERVABLES\n\n7\n\nProof. Let us first note that since G is Hausdorff and second countable, it is metrizable and we\ncan choose a left invariant metric d for G, i.e., d(gx, gy) = d(x, y) for every g, x, y \u2208 G (see, for\ninstance, Theorem 8.3 in [10] for this fact).\nSuppose that (i) holds. We make a counter assumption that \u03bd is not a Dirac measure,\ni.e., there are two different points x, y in the support of \u03bd. Denote r := 15 d(x, y). Then\nthe open balls B(x; r) and B(y; r) are disjoint and have positive \u03bd-measure. Thus, if we set\n\u03b1 = min{\u03bd(B(x; r)), \u03bd(B(y; r))}, then \u03b1 > 0. As the metric d is left invariant, we have\ngB(x; r) = B(gx; r) for any g \u2208 G. Moreover, for any g \u2208 G, we have B(gx; r) \u2229 B(x; r) = \u2205\nor B(gx; r) \u2229 B(y; r) = \u2205. This implies that \u03bd(gB(x; r)) \u2264 1 \u2212 \u03b1 for all g \u2208 G. It then follows\nthat\nZ\nkE\u03bd (B(x; r))k =\n\u03bd(g \u22121 B(x; r)) dE(g) \u2264 sup \u03bd(g \u22121 B(x; r)) * kE(G)k \u2264 1 \u2212 \u03b1 < 1.\nG\n\ng\u2208G\n\nThis is in contradiction with our assumption that (i) holds. Hence, \u03bd is the Dirac measure \u03b4x\nfor some point x \u2208 G. For every x \u2208 G and X \u2208 B(G), we have\n(6)\n\nkE\u03b4x (Xx)k = kE(X)k .\n\nTherefore, kE(X)k = 1 for every open set X \u2286 G since the right multiplication is a homeomorphism. This shows that (i)\u21d2(ii).\nThe fact that (ii)\u21d2(i) is clear from (6).\n\u0003\nAs a consequence of Propositions 3 and 4, we get the following result.\nProposition 5. Let E \u2208 O be an approximately sharp observable. Then E is postprocessing\nclean in O. Another observable F \u2208 O is postprocessing equivalent with E if and only if F = Ex\nfor some x \u2208 G.\nProof. Let E \u2208 O be an approximately sharp observable. If F \u2208 O is such that E 4post F, then\nby Prop. 3 we have E = F\u03bd for some \u03bd \u2208 M1+ (G). But Prop. 4 now implies that \u03bd = \u03b4x for some\npost\nx \u2208 G, which means, in particular, that E \u223c F. Therefore, E is postprocessing clean. This\nreasoning also proves the second claim.\n\u0003\n2.5. Preprocessing. Let \u03a6 : T (H) \u2192 T (H) be a linear mapping such that its adjoint \u03a6\u2217 :\nL(H) \u2192 L(H) is completely positive and \u03a6\u2217 (I) = I. We say that \u03a6 is a channel and denote\nthe set of all channels by Ch(H). Let Ch(H)\u2217 be the set of the adjoints of channels, that is,\nCh(H)\u2217 consists of normal completely positive maps \u039e : L(H) \u2192 L(H) such that \u039e(I) = I.\nDefinition 6. Let E, F \u2208 O. We say that F is a preprocessing of E, and denote F 4pre E, if\nthere exists a channel \u03a6 : T (H) \u2192 T (H) such that\n(7)\n\n\u0398F = \u0398E \u25e6 \u03a6.\n\nWritten in terms of the adjoint channel \u03a6\u2217 , Eq. (7) amounts to say that F(X) = \u03a6\u2217 (E(X))\nfor all X \u2208 B(G).\npre\nThe relation 4pre on O is clearly a preorder and we denote by \u223c the induced equivalence\nrelation.\n\n\f8\n\nCARMELI, HEINOSAARI, PELLONP\u00c4\u00c4, AND TOIGO\n\nDefinition 7.

If E, F \u2208 O and E \u223c F, then E \u223c F.\nProof. The relation E \u223c F means that F(*) = W E(*)W \u2217 for some unitary operator W . Define\nunitary channels \u03a61 (T ) = W \u2217 T W and \u03a62 (T ) = W T W \u2217. Then \u0398F = \u0398E \u25e6 \u03a61 and \u0398E = \u0398F \u25e6 \u03a62 .\npre\nHence, E \u223c F.\n\u0003\nProposition 7. Let E, F \u2208 O and F 4pre E. If F is approximately sharp, then also E is\napproximately sharp.\nProof. For any X \u2208 B(\u03a9), we get\nkF(X)k = sup tr [\u033aF(X)] = sup tr [\u03a6(\u033a)E(X)] \u2264 sup tr [\u033aE(X)] = kE(X)k .\n\u033a\u2208S(H)\n\n\u033a\u2208S(H)\n\n\u033a\u2208S(H)\n\nThus, kF(X)k = 1 implies that kE(X)k = 1.\n\n\u0003\n\nA channel \u03a6 is called U-covariant if\n(9)\n\n\u03a6(U(g)\u033aU(g)\u2217 ) = U(g)\u03a6(\u033a)U(g)\u2217\n\nfor every \u033a \u2208 S(H) and g \u2208 G.\nProposition 8. Let E, F \u2208 O and F 4pre E. Then there is a U-covariant channel \u03a6 such that\n(7) holds.\nProof. Let \u03a6 be a channel such that (7) holds. Since E and F are covariant, we have\n(10)\n\n\u0398F (U(g)\u2217 \u033aU(g)) = \u0398E (U(g)\u2217 \u03a6(\u033a)U(g))\n\nfor every \u033a \u2208 S(H) and g \u2208 G. We define a linear mapping \u03a6\u0306 : T (H) \u2192 T (H) by setting\nZ\n(11)\n\u03a6\u0306(\u033a) = U(g)\u03a6(U(g)\u2217 \u033aU(g))U(g)\u2217 dg .\nLet \u03a6\u2217 and \u03a6\u0306\u2217 be the adjoints of \u03a6 and \u03a6\u0306.

But \u03a6\u0306\u2217 (I) = I so that \u03a6\u0306 is a channel. Using\nthe invariance of the Haar integral, it is straightforward to verify that \u03a6\u0306 is U-covariant. By\nEq.

We will need the following general result in order to characterise the set\nof U-covariant elements in Ch(H)\u2217 . For a proof, see e.g. [4].\nProposition 9. Suppose U is a unitary representation of G in a Hilbert space H, and \u039e \u2208\nCh(H)\u2217 is a U-covariant channel. There exists a separable Hilbert space K, a unitary representation D of G in K, and an isometry W : H \u2192 K \u2297 H such that\nW U(g) = (D(g) \u2297 U(g))W\n\u2200g \u2208 G ,\n\u2217\n\u039e(A) = W (I \u2297 A)W\n\u2200A \u2208 L(H) .\n\n(14)\n\nWe apply Proposition 9 in Section 3.7 in the study of phase observables.\n3. Optimal phase observables\n3.1. Structure of phase observables. Let H be a complex Hilbert space with an orthonormal\nbasis {|ni | n \u2208 N}, N = {0, 1, 2, ...}. We define the lowering, raising, and number operators as\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\nX\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2217\n\u2217\na :=\nn + 1 |n ih n + 1|,\na :=\nn + 1 |n + 1 ih n|,\nN := a a =\nn |n ih n|,\nn=0\n\nn=0\n\nn=0\n\nrespectively. Physically the Hilbert space H and the above operators are associated with a\nsingle-mode optical field. The vectors |ni are called number states.\nP\n2\nzn\n\u221a\nCoherent states |zi := e\u2212|z| /2 \u221e\nn=0 n! |ni, where z \u2208 C, describe laser light which is quasimonochromatic and thus can be approximated as a single-mode system; here |z| is the energy\nand arg z is the phase parameter of |zi.\nAn observable E describing a phase parameter measurement should have the interval [0, 2\u03c0)\nas its outcome space. For convenience, we use one dimensional torus T = {t \u2208 C : |t| = 1} as\nan equivalent description. Let |zi be a coherent state and t \u2208 T. Then |tzi is another coherent\nstate, now having phase parameter arg z + arg t (addition modulo 2\u03c0). Therefore, we require\nthat E describing a phase parameter measurement satisfies the condition\n(15)\n\npE|tzi (X) = pE|zi(t\u22121 X)\n\nfor all z \u2208 C, t \u2208 T and X \u2208 B(T).\nAs shown in [20], an observable E : B(T) \u2192 L(H) satisfies condition (15) if and only if\n(16)\n\nU(t)E(X)U(t)\u2217 = E(tX)\n\n\f10\n\nCARMELI, HEINOSAARI, PELLONP\u00c4\u00c4, AND TOIGO\n\nfor all t \u2208 T and X \u2208 B(T), where U is the number representation of T in H, i.e.,\nU(t)|ni = tn |ni \u2200n \u2208 N.\nClearly, U(t)|zi = |tzi We take this covariance condition as the definition for phase observables.\nDefinition 8. An observable E : B(T) \u2192 L(H) is a phase observable if it satisfies the covariance\ncondition (16).\nThe following phase theorem characterizing phase observables has been proved in various\ndifferent methods in [5, 12, 18].\nTheorem 1 (Phase Theorem). An observable E : B(T) \u2192 L(H) is a phase observable if and\nonly if\nZ\nZ\nd\u03b8\nm\u2212n\nhm|E(X)|ni = cm,n\nt\ndt = cm,n\nei(m\u2212n)\u03b8\n\u2200m, n \u2208 N ,\n2\u03c0\nX\narg X\nwhere the phase matrix (cm,n ) is a positive semidefinite complex N \u00d7 N-matrix and cn,n = 1 for\nall n \u2208 N.\nIf E1 , E2 are phase observables with phase matrices (c1m,n ) and (c2m,n ), then E1 \u223cU E2 if and\nonly if there exists a sequence {\u03bbn }n\u2208N \u2208 T such that c1m,n = \u03bbn \u03bbm c2m,n .\nUsing Theorem 1 we can easily see some general properties of phase observables. For instance, the probability measure pE|ni of a phase observable E in a number state |ni is uniformly\ndistributed, which is expected as number states do not have specific phase. Also, a phase\nobservable is never sharp (a projection valued measure); see e.g. [18].\nWe notice that U-equivalence for two phase observables is, in general, stronger requirement\nthan equivalence. This is demonstrated in the following proposition.\nProposition 10. There exist phase observables E1 and E2 such that E1 is equivalent to E2 , but\nE1 is not U-equivalent to E2 .\nProof. Fix z \u2208 C, 0 < |z| < 1, and define phase observables E1 and E2 by setting\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u22121\nE1 (X) =\ndt I + z\nt dt |0 ih 1| + z\nt dt |1 ih 0| ,\nX\nX\nX\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u22121\nt dt |3 ih 2|\nE2 (X) =\ndt I + z\nt dt |2 ih 3| + z\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nfor all X \u2208 B(T). Define a unitary operator W as\nW = |2 ih 0| + |0 ih 2| + |1 ih 3| + |3 ih 1| +\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=4\n\n|n ih n| .\n\nThen E2 = W E1 W \u2217 . From Theorem 1 one sees easily that E1 and E2 cannot be U-equivalent. \u0003\n\n\fOPTIMAL PHASE OBSERVABLES\n\n11\n\n3.2. Canonical phase observable. The canonical phase observable Ecan is the phase observable determined by the phase matrix cm,n = 1 for all m, n \u2208 N. If E is another phase observable\nwith a phase matrix (cm,n ), then E \u223cU Ecan if and only if |cm,n | = 1 for all m, n \u2208 N; see [19].\nThe canonical phase observable Ecan has some properties which make it special among all\nphase observables. For example, it is the only phase observable (up to equivalence) which\ngenerates the number shifts [19]. A drawback of Ecan is that a realistic measurement scheme\nfor it is not known.\nWe will see that Ecan is optimal phase observable in all the four different ways we listed in\nSection 1. However, (perhaps surprisingly) it is not the unique phase observable having this\nfeature.\n\u2217\n\n3.3. State generated phase observables. Let D(z) := eza \u2212za , z \u2208 C, be the shift operator,\nand denote\nby S(H)diag the convex set of all diagonalPstates, that is, the states of the form\nP\n\u221e\n\u03bb\nT = \u221e\nn=0 \u03bbn = 1. Obviously, the extremal\nn=0 n |nihn|, where \u03bbn \u2265 0 for all n \u2208 N and\nelements of S(H)diag are the one-dimensional projections of the form |n ih n|, n \u2208 N.\nThe phase observable generated by T \u2208 S(H)diag (or a phase space phase observable), denoted\nby ET , is defined by\nZ\nZ \u221e\n\u0001\u2217\n\u0001\n1\n(weakly)\n(17)\nET (X) =\nD rei\u03b8 T D rei\u03b8 r dr d\u03b8\n\u03c0 arg X 0\nfor all X \u2208 B(T) [18]. Using the decompostion of T , one gets\nET (X) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=0\n\n\u03bbn E|ni (X)\n\n(weakly) for all X \u2208 B(T),\n\nwhere we have denoted E|n ih n| briefly by E|ni . Note that the operator T in formula (17) must\nbe diagonal in the number basis so that the corresponding observable would be phase shift\ncovariant [18].\nState generated phase observables are important since some of them have been measured.\nIndeed, E|0i can be seen as an angle margin observable of a phase space observable associated\nto a Q-function, and this has been measured by Walker and Carrol for a coherent state input\nfield [25]. Moreover, in principle all state generated phase observables can be measured using\nan eight-port homodyne detector [16].\nWe will see that state generated phase observables are approximately sharp and postprocessing clean. They are not extremal nor preprocessing clean.\n3.4. Approximately sharp phase observables. Let C(T) be a Banach space of continuous\ncomplex functions on T equipped with the sup norm. By the Riesz representation theorem,\nthe topological dual M(T) of C(T) consists of regular complex Borel measures on T (or Baire\nmeasures). We equip M(T) with the weak-starRtopology.R In this topology, a net {pi }i\u2208I \u2282\nM(T) converges to a point p \u2208 M(T) if limi\u2208I f dpi = f dp for all f \u2208 C(T); we denote\np = w*-limi\u2208I pi .\n\n\f12\n\nCARMELI, HEINOSAARI, PELLONP\u00c4\u00c4, AND TOIGO\n\nLet \u03b4t : C(T) \u2192 C, f 7\u2192 \u03b4t (f ) = f (t) be the Dirac distribution (or Dirac measure) concentrated on t \u2208 T. Let us write the parameter z of a coherent state |zi in the form z = rt, where\nr = |z| \u2208 R and t = z/|z| \u2208 T. Let us then recall the following result, proved in [19].\nProposition 11. Let E be a phase observable with a phase matrix (cm,n ), and let u \u2208 T. Then\nw*-lim pE|rti = \u03b4tu\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nif and only if\nlim cm,m+k = uk\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nfor all k = 1, 2, 3, ....\nThis leads to the following useful conclusion.\nProposition 12. Let E be a phase observable with a phase matrix (cm,n ). If there exists u \u2208 T\nsuch that\n(18)\n\nlim cm,m+k = uk\n\nm\u2192\u221e\n\nfor all k = 1, 2, 3, ..., then E is approximately sharp.\nProof. If condition (18) holds, then w*-limr\u2192\u221e pE|rti = \u03b4tu by the previous proposition. Let\nX \u2208 B(T) be a nonempty open set and choose t such that tu \u2208 X. Let f \u2208 C(T) be such that\nf (tu) = 1,Rthe support of f is contained in X and 0 \u2264 f \u2264 1. For any \u01eb > 0 there exists r\u01eb \u2265 0\nsuch that f dpE|rti > 1 \u2212 \u01eb for all r \u2265 r\u01eb . Since, for all r \u2265 r\u01eb ,\nZ\nE\nE\n1 = p|rti (X) + p|rti (T \\ X) \u2265 f dpE|rti + pE|rti (T \\ X) > 1 \u2212 \u01eb + pE|rti (T \\ X)\nit follows that pE|rti (T \\ X) < \u01eb for all r \u2265 r\u01eb . Thus, limr\u2192\u221e pE|rti (T \\ X) = 0 and, hence,\n\u0003\nlimr\u2192\u221e pE|rti (X) = 1. This implies that kE(X)k = 1.\n\nNote that (in the context of the above proof) limr\u2192\u221e pE|rti (X) = \u03b4tu (X) does not hold for\nall open X. Take, e.g., X = T \\ {tu} and note that then pE|rti (X) = 1 since pE|rti is absolutely\ncontinuous measure with respect to the Haar measure.\nSince the canonical phase observable Ecan corresponds to the phase matrix cm,n = 1, it follows\nfrom Proposition 12 that Ecan is approximately sharp (see also [9] for a different proof).\nProposition 13. All state generated phase observables ET , T \u2208 S(H)diag , are approximately\nsharp.\nP\nProof. Let ET be the phase observable generated by T =\ns\u2208N \u03bbs |s ih s| \u2208 S(H)diag . Since\nP\u221e\nP\n|si\nET = s=0 \u03bbs E|si (weakly), the phase matrix elements of ET are cTm,n = \u221e\ns=0 \u03bbs cm,n . It has\n|si\n|si\nbeen shown in [19] that limm\u2192\u221e cm,m+k = 1 for all k \u2208 N and s \u2208 N. Since |cm,m+k | \u2264 1, we\nhave limm\u2192\u221e cTm,m+k = 1 for all k \u2208 N. The claim follows then from Prop. 12 with u = 1. \u0003\n\n\fOPTIMAL PHASE OBSERVABLES\n\n13\n\nFinally, let us notice that, as seen in the proof of Proposition 12,\nlim hrt|ET (X)|rti = 1\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere X \u2286 T is open set and t \u2208 X. This means that in the classical limit when the energy of\nthe state |zi is large, the phase parameter of |zi can be determined accurately by measuring ET .\nHowever, there is no phase observable E for which hrt|E(X)|rti \u2248 1 for finite energies r = |z|.\nThere exist (phase shift covariant) generalized operator measures satisfying this condition; these\nmeasures describe measurements where only a restricted class of state preparations are available\n[22].\n3.5. Extremal phase observables. Let C be the convex set of all phase matrices and let\nExt C be the set of the extremal elements. The correspondence between the convex sets C and\nO preserves the convex structures. Especially, a phase observable E determined by a phase\nmatrix (cn,m ) is extremal in O if and only if (cn,m ) is extremal in C.\nLet (cn,m ) be a phase matrix. It is always possible to choose a Hilbert space K and a sequence\nof unit vectors {\u03b7n }n\u2208N which is total in K such that cn,m = h \u03b7n | \u03b7m i for all n, m \u2208 N; see [5].\nThe dimension of K is uniquely determined by (cn,m ) and we call dim K the rank of (cn,m ). Let us\ndenote by T (K) the Banach space of trace-class operators on K. As proved in [3], [17], the phase\nmatrix (cn,m ) is extremal if and only if the trace-class closure of linC {|\u03b7n ih \u03b7n | : n \u2208 N} \u2286 T (K)\nis T (K).\np\n\u03be\n\u03be\nExample 1. Let \u03be \u2208 C, |\u03be| \u2264 1. Define unit vectors \u03b72n\n:= |0i and \u03b72n+1\n:= \u03be|0i + 1 \u2212 |\u03be|2|1i\n\u03be\nfor all n \u2208 N and a phase matrix (c\u03ben,m ) by c\u03ben,m := h\u03b7n\u03be |\u03b7m\ni. Thus, (c\u03ben,m ) is the phase matrix of\nthe so-called chess-board phase observable E\u03be ; see [19]. Assume that |\u03be| =\n6 1. Then the Hilbert\nspace K is C|0i + C|1i and the rank of (c\u03ben,m ) is 2. Moreover,\np\n\u0001\n\b\n|0 ih 1| \u2208\n/ linC |\u03b7n\u03be ih \u03b7n\u03be | : n \u2208 N = C|0 ih 0| + C \u03be|0 ih 1| + \u03be|1 ih 0| + 1 \u2212 |\u03be|2 |1 ih 1|\n\nso that E\u03be is not extremal. If |\u03be| = 1, then the rank of (c\u03ben,m ) is 1 and E\u03be is automatically\nextremal; see Proposition 5 in [3]. In addition, |c\u03ben,m | = 1 for all n, m \u2208 N so that E\u03be \u223c Ecan\n[19]. For more examples of extremal phase observables, we refer to [17].\n\nProposition 14. If the phase matrix (cm,n ) has rank greater than 1 and cm,n \u2208 R for all\nm, n \u2208 N, then (cm,n ) \u2208\n/ Ext C, that is, the corresponding phase observable E is not extremal.\n\nProof. Let \u03b7m , \u03b7n be two linearly independent vectors in K, and define a (nonzero) bounded\noperator B = |\u03b7m ih \u03b7n | \u2212 |\u03b7n ih \u03b7m | on K. For every j \u2208 N, we have\ntr [B|\u03b7j ih \u03b7j |] = cn,j cj,m \u2212 cm,j cj,n = cn,j cj,m \u2212 cn,j cj,m = cn,j cj,m \u2212 cn,j cj,m = 0 .\n\nBy the Hahn-Banach theorem this implies that the set linC {|\u03b7n ih \u03b7n | : n \u2208 N} is not dense in\nT (K). Therefore, using the above cited criterion the phase matrix (cm,n ) is not extremal. \u0003\n|si \u0001\nFix s \u2208 N.

Hence, the \u03b7n -vectors of cm,n are the unit\nvectors fns , n \u2208 N, of L2 (R+ , e\u2212x dx), where R+ is the set of positive reals. All the functions\n|si\nfns , n \u2208 N, are linearly independent, and therefore the rank of (cm,n ) is infinite. It is clear that\n|si\ncm,n \u2208 R for all m, n \u2208 N, and hence the phase observable E|si is not extremal by Proposition\n14.\nP\nLet P\nET be the phase observable generated by a state T = \u221e\ns=0 \u03bbs |s ih s| \u2208 S(H)diag . Then\n\u221e\nET = s=0 \u03bbs E|si and hence, ET is not extremal. We thus have the following conclusion.\n\nProposition 15. Any ET , T \u2208 S(H)diag , is not extremal in the convex set of all phase observables.\nP\n|si\nFor completeness, we note that the phase matrix elements of ET are cTm,n = \u221e\ns=0 \u03bbs cm,n =\n\u221a\nP\nT\nfm\n| fnT , where fnT = \u221e\n\u03bbs fns \u2297|si is a unit vector of the Hilbert space L2 (R+ , e\u2212x dx)\u2297H,\ns=0\nand it follows that rank(cTm,n ) = \u221e.\nRemark 1. Since the physically relevant phase observables ET and Ecan all have real-valued\nphase matrices, it would be interesting to study the extremals of the smaller convex set of realvalued phase matrices CR = {(cm,n ) \u2208 C | cm,n \u2208 R, m, n \u2208 N}. The complete characterization\nof such extemals is given in [17, Theorem 1]. The canonical phase observable is extremal in\nCR , but the question of the extremality of the state generated phase observables is open. The\nmethod of the proof of Proposition 14 cannot be directly applied in this case as the operator\n|\u03b7m ih \u03b7n |\u2212|\u03b7n ih \u03b7m | is trivial on the real Banach space Ts (K) of selfadjoint trace class operators\non K = linR {\u03b7n : n \u2208 N}.\n\n3.6. Postprocessing. As explained in Section 3.4, the observables Ecan and ET are approximately sharp. Therefore, it follows directly from Proposition 5 that they are all postprocessing\nclean in O. It still remains to check whether they are postprocessing equivalent. Let us start\nwith the following observation.\nProposition 16. Let T, T \u2032 \u2208 S(H)diag . If ET = ET \u2032 , then T = T \u2032 .\nP\nP\nProof. Let T = s\u2208N \u03bbs |s ih s| \u2208 S(H)diag and T \u2032 = s\u2208N \u03bb\u2032s |s ih s| \u2208 S(H)diag .

Indeed, we have the\nfollowing example.\n\n\fOPTIMAL PHASE OBSERVABLES\n\n19\n\nExample 2. Let n0 \u2265 1. Define cnm = 1 if n \u2265 n0 and m \u2265 n0 , and cnm = \u03b4nm (Kronecker\ndelta) otherwise. Obviously, (cnm ) is a phase matrix and the corresponding phase observable\nE is not unitarily equivalent with Ecan . As a consequence of Proposition 19 we conclude that\npre\npost\nE \u223c Ecan . However, in Proposition 5 we have shown that E \u223cU Ecan equals E \u223c Ecan .\nTherefore, E and Ecan are not postprocessing equivalent. Note that cm,n \u2208 R for all m, n and\nthe rank of (cnm ) is n0 + 1 (this can be seen easily by noting that the \u03b7-sequence of (cnm )\ncan be chosen such that the first n0 + 1 \u03b7n 's are mutually orthonormal and \u03b7n = \u03b7n0 +1 for all\nn > n0 + 1), hence E is not extremal by Prop. 14. Moreover, E is approximately sharp by\nProp. 12 and, thus, postprocessing clean.\nWe have seen that Ecan is optimal in all four ways. However, there are also other phase\nobservables sharing this feature. This is illustrated in the following example.\nExample 3. Let {f1 , f2 } be the canonical basis of C2 , and let \u03b70 = f1 , \u03b71 = f2 , \u03b72 = 2\u22121/2 (f1 +\nf2 ), \u03b73 = 2\u22121/2 (f1 + if2 ), and \u03b7n = f1 for all n \u2265 4. Define the phase matrix cm,n = h \u03b7m | \u03b7n i,\nand let E be the associated phase observable.\nIt has been shown in [17] that (cm,n ) is a rank 2 phase matrix which is extremal in the convex\nset of phase matrices, hence E is extremal in the convex set O. Moreover, limm\u2192\u221e cm,m+k = 1 for\nall k \u2208 N, and therefore E is approximately sharp by Proposition 12. It follows from Proposition\n5 that it is also postprocessing clean. By Proposition 19 the observable E is preprocessing clean.\nHowever, E 6\u223cU Ecan since the ranks of the associated phase matrices are different.\nAcknowledgments.
