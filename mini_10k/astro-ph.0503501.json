We study the changes in physical and chemical conditions during the early stages of collapse of a\npre\u2013protostellar core, starting from initial conditions appropriate to a dense molecular cloud and proceeding\nto the \"completely depleted\" limit. We allow for molecular desorption from the grain surfaces and follow the\nevolution of the ionization degree and the ionic composition as functions of time and density. The timescale for\ncollapse is treated as a parameter and taken equal to either the free\u2013fall or the ambipolar diffusion time. The\nprocesses of freeze\u2013out on to the dust grains and of coagulation of the grains were treated simultaneously with\nthe chemical evolution of the medium in the course of its collapse. When proceeding at close to its maximum rate,\ncoagulation has important consequences for the degree of ionization and the ionic composition of the medium, but\nits effect on the freeze\u2013out of the neutral species is modest. An innovation of our study is to calculate the grain\ncharge distribution; this is done in parallel with the chemistry and the dynamics. The grain charge distribution\nis significant because H+ ions recombine predominantly on the surfaces of negatively charged grains. We have\nalso attempted to reproduce with our models the observational result that nitrogen\u2013containing species, such as\nNH3 and N2 H+ , remain in the gas phase at densities for which CO and other C\u2013containing molecules appear to\nhave frozen on to grain surfaces. We conclude that recent measurements of the adsorption energies of N2 and CO\ninvalidate the interpretation of these observations in terms of the relative volatilities of N2 and CO. We consider an\nalternative explanation, in terms of low sticking coefficients for either molecular or atomic N; but this hypothesis\nrequires experimental confirmation.

Introduction\nThe contraction of an interstellar \"core\" to form a protostar is a process of great current interest. It is clear that\nthis contraction is accompanied by considerable changes\nboth in the characteristics of the grains associated with\nthe core and the chemical composition of the gas. In particular, most molecules containing heavy elements condense on to grain surfaces (Bacmann et al. 2002, Tafalla\net al. 2004). For CO and several other species, this process\n4\n\u22123\noccurs at densities nH >\n\u223c 3 10 cm . Moreover, there is\nevidence in several objects for a \"molecular hole\" at densities above 106 cm\u22123 , where material containing C,N,O\nis in solid form and only molecules and ions composed of\nH and D remain in the gas phase.\nSend offprint requests to: C.M. Walmsley\n\nIn two earlier articles (Walmsley et al. 2004, Flower et\nal. 2004), we have considered the characteristics of such\n\"completely depleted\" regions and have concluded that\nthe degree of ionization of the gas and the relative abun+\n+\n+\ndances of the major ions (H+ , H+\n3 , H2 D , D2 H , D3 ) are\nsensitive to the size of the negatively charged grains, with\nwhich H+ ions recombine. Recent observations of H2 D+\nand D2 H+ (Caselli et al. 2003, Vastel et al. 2004) are\ncompatible with the existence of a zone lacking heavy elements. However, detection of these ions (H2 D+ and D2 H+ )\nseems to be rare, suggesting that objects containing such\na depleted nucleus are in the ultimate phase of evolution,\nprior to the formation of a protostar. It seems relevant also\nthat the observations suggest that there is an intermedi6\n\u22123\nmolecules\nate density range (105 <\n\u223c 10 cm ) where\n\u223c nH <\ncontaining nitrogen, such as NH3 and N2 H+ , remain in the\ngas phase when carbon\u2013 and oxygen\u2013containing species\n\n\f2\n\nD.R. Flower et al.: Freeze\u2013out and coagulation in pre\u2013protostellar collapse\n\nare already depleted out. This effect of differential depletion was believed to be due to the relatively high volatility\nof N2 (see Bergin & Langer 1997), which remains in the gas\nphase when CO, for example, has condensed out. However,\nrecent measurements of the adsorption energies of CO and\nN2 , which are found to differ by less than 10% (Oberg et\nal. 2004), do not support this interpretation. Accordingly,\nwe attempt to account for the differential depletion by\nvarying other (uncertain) parameters of the model.\nAn important issue is the extent to which grain coagulation takes place during contraction, thereby influencing the timescale for molecular depletion. Studies of\nthis process (e.g. Ossenkopf 1993, Ossenkopf & Henning\n1994, Suttner & Yorke 2001) suggest that, at densities\n7\n\u22123\n105 <\n\u223c 10 cm , grains grow in size, although not\n\u223c nH <\nto the same extent as in protoplanetary disks, where the\ndensity is higher. The grain opacity per H nucleus, defined here as (ng /nH )\u03c0a2g , where ng is the number density\nof grains of radius ag and nH = n(H)+2n(H2 ), is expected\nto decrease but not sufficiently to prevent depletion on to\ngrain surfaces (whose rate is proportional to the same parameter); this is consistent with what is known about the\nmm\u2013sub-mm opacity of prestellar cores (e.g. Bianchi et\nal. 2003, Kramer et al. 2003).\nWith the above points in mind, we have undertaken\ncalculations of the evolution of the chemical composition\nof such a contracting core. Our work is similar in some respects, but differs in others, to studies of the surface and\ngas\u2013phase chemistries in a contracting core by Aikawa et\nal. (2001, 2003, 2005), as well as the time\u2013dependent calculations of Roberts et al. (2003) and the recent study\nof Bonnor\u2013Ebert spheres by Lee et al. (2004). Our model\nincorporates a less detailed treatment of the gas\u2013phase\nchemistry, and we do not attempt to treat surface reactions explicitly. Instead, we have emphasized the evolution of grain charge and size with time and the consequences for the ion chemistry, which we perceive to be a\nkey aspect of the problem. The grain size (through the\ngrain surface area) influences the relative abundances of\nH+ and H+\n3 , which are likely to be the major ions during\nthe later phases of core contraction. Our models bring out\nthe important role played under some circumstances by\nH+ , whose significance appears to have been neglected \u2013\nor, at least, not emphasized \u2013 in earlier studies.\nIn Section 2 of this article, we summarize our formulation of the problem. In Section 3, we consider the critical\ninput parameters of the model. Our main results are given\nin Section 4 and our concluding remarks in Section 5.\n\n2. Formulation\nWe consider the evolution of a contracting sphere (\"core\")\nof gas and dust and, for simplicity, we use equations applicable to free\u2013fall, homologous, isothermal collapse. This\nprocedure allows us to parametrize the dynamical behaviour in terms of a collapse timescale, \u03c4c , which we vary\nbetween a minimum value, taken to be the free\u2013fall time,\n\u03c4ff , and a maximum value, defined by the ambipolar dif-\n\nfusion timescale, \u03c4ad (see below), both evaluated according to the initial conditions in the medium. In practice,\nthe ambipolar timescale is about an order of magnitude\nlarger than the free\u2013fall time. Thus, \u03c4c spans timescales\nbetween the magnetically subcritical case, in which the\nmagnetic flux suffices to prevent collapse, and the magnetically supercritical case, where collapse can take place\nimmediately.\nThe equation which determines the variation of the\nradius R of the core with time t is\n\u0012\n\u0013 12\n1\n1 dx\n\u03c0\n1 dR\n\u2261\n=\u2212\n\u22121\n(1)\nR dt\nx dt\n2\u03c4c x x\nwhere x = R/R0 \u2264 1 and R0 is the initial radius of\nthe condensation. The timescale for free\u2013fall collapse is\n(Spitzer 1978)\n\u0015 12\n\u0014\n3\u03c0\n(2)\n\u03c4ff =\n32G\u03c10\nwhere \u03c10 is the initial mass per unit volume. In spherical\ncollapse, the mass density \u03c1 varies with time t according\nto\n3 dx\n1 d\u03c1\n=\u2212\n\u03c1 dt\nx dt\n\n(3)\n\nIn practice, the collapse is described by equation (1), with\nthe timescale \u03c4c taken to be either \u03c4ff or the ambipolar\ndiffusion timescale, \u03c4ad , to be defined below. As already\nnoted, \u03c4ad is about an order of magnitude larger than \u03c4ff .\nThe medium contains neutral gas, positive ions and\nelectrons; it also contains neutral and (mainly negatively)\ncharged grains. The number density, n, of the gas\u2013phase\nneutrals is determined by\n1 dn\n3 dx N\n=\u2212\n+\nn dt\nx dt\nn\n\n(4)\n\nwhere N is the rate per unit volume at which neutrals are\ncreated in the gas phase by chemical reactions. Similarly,\nfor the positive ions in the gas phase\n3 dx N+\n1 dn+\n=\u2212\n+\nn+ dt\nx dt\nn+\n\n(5)\n\nAnalogous equations are solved for each of the chemical\nspecies which intervene in the chemistry.\nCentral to our approach, and distinguishing it from\nprevious work, is the self\u2013consistent calculation of the\nchange in the grain cross section which occurs owing to\ncoagulation and to freeze\u2013out from the gas phase. The\ngrains are assumed to have a unique radius, determined\ninitially by the grain:gas mass ratio and the mass density of the grain material. Subsequently, the grain radius\nvaries owing to the freeze\u2013out of gas\u2013phase constituents\non to the surfaces of the grains and to grain coagulation.\nThe rate of variation of the grain number density is given\nby\n3 dx Ng\n1 dng\n=\u2212\n+\nng dt\nx dt\nng\n\n(6)\n\n\fD.R. Flower et al.: Freeze\u2013out and coagulation in pre\u2013protostellar collapse\n\nwhere ng is the grain number density. The first term on\nthe right hand side of this equation represents the rate\nof increase of the number density owing to the compression associated with the (spherical) collapse; the second\nrepresents the rate of decrease of the grain number density owing to coagulation. When two grains stick together,\nonly one grain remains, and hence the rate per unit volume at which the grains are removed through coagulation\nis Ng = \u2212h\u03c3vin2g . The method used to determine the rate\nconstant h\u03c3vi is presented in Appendix A. We have assumed the grains to be spherical, which minimizes their\nsurface area and effective cross section for a given volume.\nClearly, non\u2013spherical grains would have a larger cross\nsection.\nIn addition to the free\u2013fall timescale [equation (2)], we\nevaluate the ambipolar diffusion timescale from\n\u03c4ad =\n\n2 X n i mi mn\nh\u03c3viin\n\u03c0Gm2n\nn n mi + mn\n\n(7)\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

Model\nAdopting the initial conditions in steady\u2013state, the condensation was allowed to undergo isothermal collapse, as\ndescribed in Section 2. The dynamical and chemical rate\nequations were solved simultaneously. The grain number\ndensity was determined by the competing effects of compression, arising from the collapse, and coagulation, which\ntends to reduce the total number of grains [cf. equation (6)\nabove]. The grain radius was calculated self\u2013consistently\nas a function of time, t, from the grain number density and\nthe total mass of material currently in the solid phase, allowing for the continuing adsorption of heavy species on to\nthe grains. In practice, adsorption has only a minor effect\non ag , as a mantle of ices is assumed to exist before the\nonset of collapse; coagulation is a much more significant\nmechanism for increasing ag .\n\n3.1. Initial conditions\nThe initial distribution of the elemental abundances across\nthe gas phase and the solid phase (i.e. grains) is given\nin Table 1. The elemental abundances derive from the\n\nstudy of Anders & Grevesse (1989), and the depletions\nfrom Savage & Sembach (1996), Gibb et al. (2000), and\nSofia & Meyer (2001), with the exception of sulphur, for\nwhich the depletion depletion from the gas phase within\nmolecular clouds is difficult to establish observationally.\nWe have assumed that sulphur is depleted from the gas\nphase by a factor of 30 (cf. Wakelam et al. 2004). Given\nthe distribution in Table 1, the initial value of the mass of\ndust to the mass of gas is 0.0094.\nThe computer code was run to determine the steady\u2013\nstate abundances of the chemical species in the gas phase\n(neglecting any further depletion) by the simple expedient\nof specifying a timescale for collapse, \u03c4c , in equation (1)\nwhich is much greater than the chemical equilibrium\ntimescale; 92 gas\u2013phase species and almost 800 chemical\nreactions were included in the model. The gas\u2013phase\nchemistry included ion\u2013neutral, neutral\u2013neutral, and\ndissociative recombination reactions involving species\ncontaining H, He, C, N, O and S. The branching ratio\nfor the dissociative recombination of N2 H+ , to N or N2 ,\nwas taken from the recent measurements of Geppert et\nal. (2004). Ionization by cosmic rays, both direct and indirect (by the electrons released), was taken into account.\nAdsorption of neutral species on to grains, and desorption of the hydrogenated products of the grain\u2013surface\nchemistry following cosmic ray heating of the grains,\nwere also incorporated (see below). The rate of cosmic\nray ionization of hydrogen was taken to be \u03b6 = 1 \u00d7 10\u221217\ns\u22121 . The list of species and the complete set of chemical reactions included in the model are available from\nhttp://massey.dur.ac.uk/drf/protostellar/species chemistry.\nThe initial value of the grain radius was taken to be\nag = 0.05 \u03bcm, which yields a grain opacity, defined here\nas ng \u03c0a2g , of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221221nH cm\u22121 , assuming the density of\nthe grain material to be 2 g cm\u22123 . Adopting the grain\u2013\nsize distribution of Mathis et al. (1977), with limits of\n0.01 \u2264 ag \u2264 0.3 \u03bcm to the distribution, and assuming the\ncanonical value of 0.01 for the dust:gas mass ratio, one\n\n\f4\n\nD.R. Flower et al.: Freeze\u2013out and coagulation in pre\u2013protostellar collapse\n\nobtains the same value of ng \u03c0a2g . [We note that the value\nof ag required to reproduce a given value of ng \u03c0a2g depends\nonly on the adopted size distribution and its limits, and\nnot on the density of the grain material nor the dust:gas\nmass ratio: see Appendix B.]\n\n3.2. Grain charge distribution\nIn view of the significance of grains for the state of charge\nof the medium, the grain charge distribution was computed in parallel with the chemical composition, allowing\nfor electron attachment and detachment and electron\u2013ion\nrecombination on grain surfaces (cf. Flower & Pineau des\nFor\u00eats 2003b, Section 2.2). Singly charged and neutral\ngrains were considered. In the case of collisions betwen\ncharged particles and oppositely charged grains, the 'focusing' effect of the Coulomb attraction was included by\nmeans of equation (3.4) of Draine & Sutin (1987). In the\ncase of collisions between charged particles and neutral\ngrains, the attraction arising from the polarization of the\ngrain by the incoming particle was included by means of\ntheir equation (3.3). For example, the rate per unit volume\nof electron attachment to neutral grains was evaluated as\nne ng0 \u03c0a2g [1 + (\u03c0e2 /2ag kB Te )0.5 ][8kB Te /(\u03c0me )]0.5 se , where\nne is the electron density, ng0 is the density of the neutral\ngrains, Te is the electron temperature (taken equal to the\ngas temperature, T = 10 K), me is the electron mass, and\nse = 0.5 is the electron sticking coefficient. The initial\nvalue of the total grain number density, ng , was calculated self\u2013consistently from the elemental depletions, the\nspecified grain radius, and the mean density of the grain\nmaterial, taken to be 2 g cm\u22123 at all times. The grain\ncharge distribution is not sensitive to the assumed grain\nsize, as the dominant charge\u2013changing processes \u2013 electron attachment to neutral grains and ion recombination\nwith negatively charged grains \u2013 scale approximately with\n3\nag2 and with ag , respectively, under the conditions which\nare relevant here.\n\n3.3. Adsorption and desorption\nThe rate coefficient for adsorption of neutral species on to\nthe grains was taken to be \u03c0a2g [8kB T /(\u03c0mn )]0.5 Sn , where\nmn is the mass of the neutral. The 'sticking' coefficient\nSn = 1, unless stated otherwise; we assumed that He remained in the gas phase and that H2 was returned to the\ngas phase after forming on the grains. The geometrical\ncross section of the grain is adopted in this expression for\nthe rate coefficient. Although the potential arising from\nthe polarization of the grain by a charged particle can\nbe significant (see Section 3.2), the potential due to the\npolarization of a neutral by a charged grain is negligible;\nthis is because the polarizability of a grain is orders of\nmagnitude larger than the polarizabilities of the neutral\ngas\u2013phase species, owing to the much larger size of the\ngrain.\n\nThe recombination of positive ions with electrons on\nthe surfaces of negatively charged grains releases the electron binding energy, which is typically a few eV and\nlarge compared with the adsorption energies of the neutral\nspecies. Accordingly, we have assumed that the neutrals\nwhich are formed in this way are returned immediately to\nthe gas phase. The attachment of ions to neutral grains\nis a relatively minor process, owing to the predominance\nof negatively charged grains (see Section 4.3 below) and\nto Coulomb focusing in collisions of ions with negatively\ncharged grains. Consequently, we have neglected the adsorption of ions on to grains when computing the rate of\nfreeze\u2013out of gas\u2013phase species.\nWith the exception of H2 , which desorbs following its\nformation, desorption of molecules was assumed to be controlled by the heating of grains which occurs owing to cosmic ray impact (L\u00e9ger et al. 1985). The rate of desorption\nof species i per unit volume per unit time from the grains\nis\nads\n\u2212(Eiads \u2212 ECO\n)\nng\nP i g ng 4\u03c0a2g \u03b3 exp[\n]\nmax\nT\nn\ng\ni i\n\nP\nwhere ngi / i ngi is the fractional abundance of species i\non grains, Eiads is the adsorption energy of the species\n(Aikawa et al. 1996, 1997, 2001), which relate to measurements on pure ices; Tgmax = 70 K is the maximum\ntemperature reached by the grains following cosmic ray\nimpact (Hasegawa & Herbst 1993). We adopted \u03b3 = 70\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 , which yields a rate of desorption for CO which\nis consistent with the value for 'spot' heating, as derived\nby L\u00e9ger et al. (1985); the heating arises from the impact\nof heavy cosmic rays, particularly Fe nuclei. In the case of\nsmall grains, 'whole\u2013grain' heating may be more important than 'spot' heating, and the corresponding value of\n\u03b3 would be larger than adopted here.\n\n3.4. Coagulation\nGrain coagulation was treated as described in Appendix\nA. The important parameters are the local turbulent speed\nof the gas, which is assumed to determine the relative\nspeed of the grains, and the critical speed vcrit (ag ) below\nwhich grains are assumed to coagulate on every collision.\nFollowing Tafalla et al. (2004), who observed L1498 and\nL1517B (see also Barranco & Goodman 1998), we adopted\nthe turbulent line\u2013width as an upper limit to the FWHM\nof the Gaussian velocity distribution, i.e. \u2206v <\n\u223c 0.12 km\ns\u22121 , which is approximately cs /2 at T = 10 K, where cs is\nthe adiabatic sound speed. This value may include contributions from motions on scales larger than the mean\u2013free\npath for grain\u2013grain collisions and hence places an upper limit on \u2206v. Accordingly, we have taken \u2206v = cs /4\nas our reference value, but we have also run models with\n\u2206v = cs /2 and \u2206v = cs /10.\nThe critical speed for coagulation, vcrit , was taken from\nChokshi et al. (1993), unless otherwise stated. We adopted\ntheir results for the case of 'ice'; this seems the most ap-\n\n\fD.R. Flower et al.: Freeze\u2013out and coagulation in pre\u2013protostellar collapse\n\npropriate of the three cases ('ice', 'graphite', 'quartz') considered by Chokshi et al., as the grains already have ice\nmantles at the start of the calculation. Accordingly,\nvcrit (ag ) = 0.1 ag\u22125/6\n\n(9)\n\nwhen vcrit is in cm s\u22121 and ag is in cm. We have assumed\nthat the grains remain spherical throughout. This assumption minimizes the grain radius, and hence the grain opacity per H nucleus, (ng /nH )\u03c0a2g , as the collapse proceeds.\nWe assume also that the density of the grain material\nis unchanged by coagulation. The critical speed given by\nequation (9) is greater than the estimate of Suttner &\nYorke (2001) but approximately 4 times less than the measurement of Poppe & Blum (1997). We have run some\ncomparison calculations in which vcrit was taken to be 4\ntimes greater than is given by equation (9).\n\n4. Results\nWe consider the case of a condensation of gas and dust\nwith an initial number density nH = n(H) + 2n(H2 ) = 104\ncm\u22123 and kinetic temperature T = 10 K. We recall that\nthe rate of cosmic ray ionization of hydrogen was taken to\nbe \u03b6 = 1 \u00d7 10\u221217 s\u22121 .\n\n4.1. Freeze\u2013out\nFig. 1 illustrates the freeze\u2013out of selected neutral species,\nincluding CO and N2 , on to the grains and the evolution\nof the fractional abundances of the major ions, includ+\ning H+ , H+\n3 and HCO . Results are shown for a reference model in which coagulation was neglected and the\ntimescale for collapse is determined by the free\u2013fall time,\n\u03c4c = \u03c4ff . The corresponding density profile, nH (t), is also\nshown in Fig. 1. As will be seen below, collapse gets under way after a few times 105 yr, and the neutral species\nthen freeze out rapidly on to the grains. Initially, HCO+\nis the most abundant molecular ion, but it is overtaken\n+\nby H+\n3 and H as freeze\u2013out proceeds. Ultimately, the degree of ionization of the gas is determined by H+\n3 under\nthe conditions of this model.\nThe adsorption energy of N2 which was used to obtain\nthe results in Fig. 1 was 790 K, which is to be compared\nads\nwith ECO\n= 855 K (Oberg et al. 2004). A much larger\ndifference between the adsorption energies of N2 and CO\nis required for there to be a significant difference between\nthe density\u2013dependence of the fractional abundances of\nN2 and CO, and hence of N2 H+ and HCO+ . Another possible explanation of this differential effect will be considered below, in the context of a discussion of the nitrogen\nchemistry.\nThe effect of allowing the ambipolar diffusion timescale\nto regulate the collapse is shown in Fig. 2a. As we shall see\nbelow, the timescale for ambipolar diffusion is about an\norder of magnitude larger than the free\u2013fall time, and so\nfreeze\u2013out occurs at lower values of the gas density, before\nthe collapse is under way. Indeed, in this case, freeze\u2013out\n\n5\n\noccurs at densities which are lower than the values of nH >\n\u223c\n3 \u00d7 104 cm\u22123 which have been deduced from observations\nof CO (cf. Bacmann et al. 2002, Tafalla et al. 2004). Thus,\nthe observational data pertaining to CO depletion favour a\ncollapse timescale of order of the free\u2013fall time. The 'knee'\nwhich is apparent in the curves arises at the fractional\nabundance at which cosmic ray desorption begins to be\nsignificant; this occurs marginally sooner for N2 than for\nCO, owing to the smaller (by 65 K) adsorption energy of\nthe former species.\nIncluding coagulation, with the expression of Chokshi\net al. (1993) for vcrit (ag ) [equation (9)], has very little effect on the results, as may be seen by comparing Figs. 2a\nand 2b: the 'free-fall' results in Fig. 2a (the upper pair\nof curves) are almost coincident with the full curves in\nFigs. 2b. Even when the (4 times larger) values of vcrit (ag )\nare adopted, following Poppe & Blum (1997), which possibly yields an upper limit to the rate of coagulation, its\neffect on the evolution of the fractional abundances of the\nneutral species is not large, as may be seen from Fig. 2b.\n\n4.2. Timescales\nIn Fig. 3, we plot the grain radius, ag , as a function of the\ngas density, nH . Results are shown for the limiting case of\n\u22125/6\nno coagulation (vcrit = 0) and for vcrit (ag ) = 0.1 ag\n[equation (9); Chokshi et al. (1993)] and vcrit (ag ) =\n\u22125/6\n(Poppe & Blum 1997); \u2206v = cs /4, where\n0.4 ag\ncs = 0.243 km s\u22121 is the adiabatic sound speed. When\nequation (9) is adopted, the initial value of the critical\nspeed for coagulation is vcrit = 0.0262 km s\u22121 , almost an\norder of magnitude smaller than cs .\nFig. 3 shows that, when no coagulation occurs, the\ngrain radius, ag , is practically constant, as the contribution of continuing freeze\u2013out to the size of the grain\nmantles is small; we have assumed that the grains have a\nmantle of ices before collapse begins. The rate of coagulation, and hence the rate of increase of the grain radius,\nag , is seen to be sensitive to the critical speed, vcrit (ag ):\nincreasing the constant of proportionality in equation (9)\nfrom 0.1 to 0.4, which is in line with the measurements of\nPoppe & Blum (1997), has the effect of enhancing significantly the degree of coagulation over the free\u2013fall time.\nReducing the turbulent width, \u2206v, which is the FWHM of\nthe Gaussian distribution [equation (A.3)], has a similar\neffect to increasing vcrit . In our model, the grain opacity\nper H nucleus, (ng /nH )\u03c0a2g , varies inversely with the grain\nradius, ag , and so the effect of coagulation is to reduce the\ngrain opacity and hence increase the timescale for depletion. The assumption which we have made, that the grains\nremain spherical, minimizes their surface area (and hence\ntheir geometrical cross section) for a given density of the\ngrain material, which we take to be constant during coagulation. Although these assumptions are not realistic (cf.\nOssenkopf and Henning 1994), they allow a lower limit to\nbe placed on the influence of coagulation on freeze\u2013out.\n\n\f6\n\nD.R. Flower et al.: Freeze\u2013out and coagulation in pre\u2013protostellar collapse\n\nThe gravitational free-fall time, \u03c4ff = 0.43 \u00d7 106 yr for\nour initial density nH = 104 cm\u22123 , is much smaller than\nthe initial ambipolar diffusion timescales for both positive\ngrain\nion\nions and charged grains, \u03c4ad\n= 3.4 \u00d7 106 yr and \u03c4ad\n=\n6\n3.6 \u00d7 10 yr. The timescale for freeze\u2013out of the neutral\nspecies on to the grains \u2013 the inverse of the adsorption\nrate \u2013 is given by\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22121\n\u03c4fo = ng \u03c0a2g vth S\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\nvth =\n\n\u0012\n\n8kB Tn\n\u03c0mn\n\n\u0013 21\n\nis the thermal speed, Tn is the kinetic temperature and\nmn is the mass of the species; S is the sticking coefficient.\nTaking Tn = 10 K and mn = 28 mH (corresponding to CO,\nas an example) and S = 1, we obtain \u03c4fo = 2.2 \u00d7 105 yr\ninitially, when ag = 0.05 \u03bcm and nH = 104 cm\u22123 . Thus,\nthe timescale characterizing freeze\u2013out is comparable with\nthe free\u2013fall timescale and much smaller than that for ambipolar diffusion. The timescale for coagulation is\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22121\n\u03c4cg = ng 4\u03c0a2g vrel\n\n(11)\n\nwhere vrel is the relative collision speed. The maximum\npossible value of vrel is vcrit [cf. equation (9)]; adopting\nvrel = vcrit , we see that\nvcrit\n\u03c4fo\n\u221d\n\u03c4cg\nvth S\n\n(12)\n\nWith the values of the parameters specified above, we obtain \u03c4cg = 1.8 \u00d7 105 yr initially, which is approximately\nequal to \u03c4fo . However, \u03c4cg tends to increase with time, owing to the increase in ag and consequent decrease in vcrit .\nAs we have assumed the maximum possible value of vrel\nwhen evaluating \u03c4cg , we conclude that freeze\u2013out tends to\noccur more rapidly than coagulation, providing the sticking coefficient S \u2248 1.\n\n4.3. Fractional ionization\nThe significance of ambipolar diffusion and, in particular,\nthe role of elastic scattering between neutrals and charged\ngrains in protostellar collapse have been recognized for\nsome considerable time (Nakano & Umebayashi 1980; Shu\net al. 1987; Ciolek & Basu 2000). Whether the timescale\nfor collapse, \u03c4c , is determined by ambipolar diffusion or by\ngravitational free\u2013fall depends on the fractional ionization\nof the gas [cf. equation (7)] and the degree of charge of the\ngrains.\nAt early times, S+ is the most abundant atomic ion,\nand its abundance is maintained by charge transfer of H+\nto S; the source of H+ is cosmic ray ionization of hydrogen. When freeze\u2013out of the neutrals on to the grains\noccurs, the fractional abundance of H+ tends to rise as\nlosses through charge transfer reactions (with S and other\n\nneutral species with ionization potentials less than that\nof H) decrease. This phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 4,\nwhere the fractional abundances of H+ and a selection of\nother ions are plotted as functions of the gas density, nH .\nThe significance of coagulation may be seen by comparing\nFig. 4a, in which coagulation is neglected, with Figs. 4b\nand c, in which coagulation is included.\nThe recombination of H+ with free electrons is a radiative process and hence slow. Consequently, H+ ions\nrecombine with electrons predominantly on the surfaces\nof negatively charged grains. On the other hand, the recombination of H+\n3 with free electrons is a non\u2013radiative\n(dissociative) process and intrinsically fast. Using the parameters adopted in our model, the ratio R of the rate\n(s\u22121 ) of dissociative recombination of H+\n3 in the gas phase\nand its rate of recombination on the surfaces of the (predominantly) negatively charged grains is\nR \u2248 2 \u00d7 1011 xe a2g\nwhere xe = ne /nH and ag is expressed in \u03bcm. Thus, when\nag = 0.05 \u03bcm, R = 1 is attained when xe \u2248 2\u00d710\u22129; then,\nH+\n3 recombines at equal rates on the surfaces of negatively\ncharged dust grains and in the gas phase. Referring to\nFig. 4a, we see that this point is reached when nH \u2248 106\ncm\u22123 . At lower densities, dissociative recombination predominates, whereas, at higher densities, recombination on\nthe surfaces of negative grains predominates, and the frac+\ntional abundances of H+\n3 and H vary similarly with nH .\n+\nThe ratio of the fractional abundances of H+\n3 and H\n+\nn(H+\n3 )/n(H ) \u2248 18/(1 + R)\n\nfor the parameters adopted in our model; this expression\nagrees well with the numerical results presented in Fig. 4a\nin the high density limit, where R \u2192 0. [We recall that,\nowing to the absence of deuterated isotopes in the present\nmodel, the number density of \"H+\n3 \" should be understood\n+\n+\n+\nas n(H+\n3 ) + n(H2 D ) + n(HD2 ) + n(D3 ).]\nIn the case where there is no coagulation, as in Fig. 4a,\nthe grain opacity per H nucleus, (ng /nH )\u03c0a2g , remains\npractically constant as the collapse proceeds; cf. Fig. 5b.\nThe H+ ions are removed (by recombination with electrons on the surfaces of negatively charged grains) on a\ntimescale which is inversely proportional to ng \u03c0a2g and\n+\n6\n\u22123\nhence to nH . For nH <\n\u223c 10 cm , H3 ions are removed predominantly by dissociative recombination with free electrons, on a timescale which is inversely proportional to\napproximately n0.5\nH . As a consequence, the fractional abundance of H+\nions\ninitially increases relative to H+ as nH\n3\nincreases, and the case of 'no coagulation' is characterized\n+\nby n(H+\n3 ) > n(H ) at high gas densities. On the other\nhand, when coagulation occurs (assuming \u2206v = cs /4 in\nFig. 4), (ng /nH )\u03c0a2g decreases as nH increases (cf. Fig. 5b),\nand the rate of recombination of the H+ ions on grains is\nreduced. Owing to the higher fractional abundance of the\n+\nfree electrons, n(H+\n3 ) < n(H ) at high gas densities when\n\u22125/6\nvcrit (ag ) = 0.4 ag . These results are summarized in\nFigs. 4a\u2013c.\n\n\fD.R. Flower et al.: Freeze\u2013out and coagulation in pre\u2013protostellar collapse\n+\nThe results in Fig. 4 show that the ratio n(H+\n3 )/n(H )\nfalls substantially when coagulation is introduced: grain\ngrowth favours H+ . On the other hand, the fact that H2 D+\nand D2 H+ have been observed in pre\u2013protostellar objects\n(Caselli et al. 2003, Vastel et al. 2004) suggests that the\ndeuterated forms of H+\n3 may be the dominant gas\u2013phase\nions. If so, the present calculations imply that coagulation is not significant in reducing the grain opacity per H\nnucleus during the early phases of collapse.\nThe final panel (d) in Fig. 4 shows the effect of reducing the value of the sticking coefficient for molecular\nnitrogen to S(N2 ) = 0.1 and should be compared with\nthose in panel (c), where S(N2 ) = 1, the default value\nfor all species which freeze out; the results in Fig. 4d are\nconsidered below.\nA novelty of the present study is the calculation of the\ngrain charge distribution, in parallel with the chemistry\nand the dynamics; the charge distribution is significant\nbecause H+ ions recombine predominantly on the surfaces\nof negatively charged grains, at a rate which is determined\n2\nby their opacity per H nucleus, (n\u2212\ng /nH )\u03c0ag . The higher\nfractional abundance of free electrons at high gas densities, owing to coagulation (cf. Fig. 4), leads to an increase\nin the fraction of the grains which are negatively charged;\nsee Fig. 5. The fraction of positively charged grains always remains small. When there is no coagulation, the\nfraction of neutral grains remains above 10% as the collapse proceeds, whereas, for the maximum rate of coagulation considered in Fig. 5, approximately 95% of the grains\nare negatively charged by the time that nH = 107 cm\u22123 .\nNonetheless, the opacity per H nucleus of the negatively\ncharged grains, (ng\u2212 /nH )\u03c0a2g , decreases as vcrit increases,\nowing to the reduction in the total grain opacity per H\nnucleus as coagulation proceeds: see Fig. 5b.\n\n4.4. Nitrogen chemistry\nOne problem which all models of the chemistry of prestellar cores have to solve is the variation of the fractional\nabundances of nitrogen\u2013containing compounds with density. Observations indicate that, whilst most molecules\ndeplete on to grain surfaces at densities of a few times\n104 cm\u22123 , species containing nitrogen, such as NH3 and\nN2 H+ , survive to densities which are an order of magnitude larger (e.g. Tafalla et al. 2004, Belloche & Andr\u00e9\n2004, Bergin et al. 2002). Chemical modellers have attempted to explain this behaviour by assuming lower values of the adsorption energy for N2 than for CO and other\nabundant neutral molecules; this results in cosmic ray\u2013\ninduced or direct thermal desorption of N2 being more efficient than for CO. Aikawa et al. (1997, 2001) and Bergin\nads\net al. (2002) give EN\n= 750 K as the adsorption en2\nads\nergy of N2 and ECO = 960 K as the adsorption energy of\nCO, on CO ice. On the other hand, recent measurements\n(Oberg et al. 2004) indicate that the adsorption energies\nads\nof N2 to N2 and CO to CO ice are EN\n= 790 K and\n2\nads\nECO = 855 K; we have adopted these values in our cal-\n\n7\n\nculations but considered the implications of using larger\nads\nads\nvalues of (ECO\n\u2212 EN\n). We have concluded that the ap2\nproximately 10% difference between the binding energies\nof CO and N2 , as measured by Oberg et al. (2004), is insufficient to account for the observed differences in fractional\nabundances, to which reference was made above. We note\nthat, in the present context, it is the ratio between the\nrates of desorption of CO and N2 which is significant and\ndetermined by the difference in their adsorption energies;\nthe absolute rates are less crucial.\nAn possible explanation of the observations is that\nthere is a difference between the sticking coefficients of\nCO and one of the principal forms of gas\u2013phase nitrogen (N or N2 ). Accordingly, we have carried out calculations in which the sticking coefficient, S, of either N\nor N2 was set equal to 0.1, whilst retaining S = 1 for\nall other species; the results of the calculations in which\nS(N2 ) = 0.1 are shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4c and Fig. 4d, we\ncompare the free\u2013fall models, including coagulation and\nwith S(N2 ) = 1 or S(N2 ) = 0.1, respectively. In the case\nof S(N2 ) = 0.1, the fractional abundance of N2 H+ , which\n6\n\u22123\ntraces N2 , decreases rapidly at densities nH >\n\u223c 10 cm ,\nwhich is roughly an order of magnitude higher than for\nthe corresponding fall\u2013off of HCO+ . The fractional abundance of N2 H+ attains values of several times 10\u221210 , which\nare, in fact, larger than the observed values. However, the\neffect upon the evolution of the major ions, H+ and H+\n3,\nis not large, and N2 H+ never becomes a major ion. We\nconclude that a small sticking coefficient for N2 could explain the observations; but this assumption is clearly ad\nhoc and needs experimental verification.\nThe other possibility is that the sticking coefficient of\natomic nitrogen is small, S(N) = 0.1. This assumption has\nthe consequence that a substantial fraction of the nitrogen\nremains in the gas phase, but it does not result in a significant enhancement of the abundance of N2 H+ , relative to\nthe case in which all the sticking coefficients S = 1. The\nreason for this result is to be found in the gas\u2013phase chemistry of nitrogen. The paths to N2 H+ and NH3 start with\nthe neutral\u2013neutral reactions N(OH, H)NO and NO(N,\nO)N2 (Pineau des For\u00eats et al. 1990), whose rates depend\non the fractions of N and OH in the gas phase. However,\nthese reactions are so slow that an increase in the initial\ngas\u2013phase abundance of N has little effect on the abundances of N2 H+ or NH3 on the timescale of the collapse.\nOnly when the abundance of N2 is increased directly, by\nreducing its sticking coefficient or its adsorption energy,\nare the abundances of N2 H+ and NH3 enhanced significantly.\n\n4.5. Validation of previous results\nIn our previous calculations of complete depletion in pre\u2013\nprotostellar cores (Walmsley et al. 2004; Flower et al.\n2004), we computed abundances in steady\u2013state, neglecting dynamical effects but including deuteration reactions.\nAlthough we do not currently consider deuteration reac-\n\n\f8\n\nD.R. Flower et al.: Freeze\u2013out and coagulation in pre\u2013protostellar collapse\n\ntions in the phase of 'free\u2013fall', it is possible to compare\nthe fractional ionization of the gas and the abundances\nof the major ions, H+ and H+\n3 , over the range of densities considered previously (2 \u00d7 105 \u2264 nH \u2264 2 \u00d7 107\ncm\u22123 ). In order to make the appropriate comparison\nwith our previous work, we plot, in Fig. 6, n(H+\n3 )/nH\nfrom the present calculations, neglecting coagulation, and\n+\n+\n+\n[n(H+\n3 ) + n(H2 D ) + n(HD2 ) + n(D3 )]/nH from our previous study (Walmsley et al. 2004).\nAs may be seen from Fig. 6, the agreement between\nthe two calculations is good. Although the abundances of\natomic ions such as Fe+ and, especially, S+ are initially\nsignificant (i.e when nH \u2248 104 cm\u22123 ), recombination with\nelectrons, on the surfaces of grains, neutralizes the atomic\nions. By the time that a density of nH \u2248 105 cm\u22123 has\n+\nbeen reached, the principal ions are H+\n3 and H , as predicted by our earlier calculations, in steady\u2013state. Thus,\neven when the collapse is as fast as in the case of 'free\u2013fall',\nthe assumption of a steady\u2013state is a good approximation.\n\n5. Concluding remarks\nWe have considered the early stages of isothermal collapse of a pre\u2013protostellar core. The initial conditions were\ntaken to be those appropriate to dense molecular clouds,\nwith significant fractions of the heavy elements being depleted into the cores or the ice mantles of dust grains. The\ntime for collapse is taken equal to the timescale which\ncharacterizes either free\u2013fall or ambipolar diffusion; the\nlatter is almost an order of magnitude larger than the former.\nThe processes of further freeze\u2013out on to the interstellar grains and of coagulation of the grains were included\nwhen calculating the chemical evolution of the medium\nin the course of its collapse. Species containing heavy elements freeze on to the grains in the early phases of the collapse. When ambipolar diffusion determines the timescale\nfor collapse, freeze\u2013out occurs at densities which are lower\nthan the values which have been deduced from observations of CO (cf. Bacmann et al. 2002, Tafalla et al. 2004);\nwe conclude that the observational data favour a collapse\ntimescale of order of the free\u2013fall time, rather than the\n(larger) ambipolar diffusion time. In this case, coagulation is unlikely to be sufficiently rapid to influence the\nrate of freeze\u2013out.\nThe rate of grain coagulation is determined by the\nturbulent velocity, \u2206v, of the medium. In the limit of\n\u2206v << cs , the rate of coagulation is negligible. On the\nother hand, when proceeding at close to its maximum rate,\ncoagulation has important consequences for the degree of\nionization and the ionic composition of the medium. At\nhigh gas densities, the major ions are H+ and H+\n3 , and\ntheir relative abundance depends on the rate of coagulation, through its effect on the grain opacity per H nucleus, (ng /nH )\u03c0a2g ; this is because H+ ions recombine on\nthe surfaces of negatively charged grains, whereas H+\n3 ions\nalso recombine dissociatively with free electrons in the gas\n+\nphase. If coagulation is slow or absent, n(H+\n3 ) > n(H ),\n\n+\nwhereas, if coagulation is rapid, n(H+\n3 ) < n(H ) at high\n+\ndensities. The observations of H2 D and D2 H+ in pre\u2013\nprotostellar objects suggest that H+\n3 and its deuterated\nforms are likely to be the dominant ions, in which case\ncoagulation is slow or absent.\nWe consider that it is important to calculate the grain\ncharge distribution, in parallel with the chemistry and the\ndynamics, because H+ ions recombine predominantly on\nthe surfaces of negatively charged grains. Grain coagulation results in an increase in the fraction of electrons\nwhich remain in the gas phase at high densities and to an\nincrease in the fraction of the grains which are negatively\ncharged; the fraction of positively charged grains is always\nsmall.\nObservations of pre\u2013protostellar cores indicate that\nnitrogen\u2013containing species, such as NH3 and N2 H+ , survive to densities which are an order of magnitude larger\nthan those at which most molecules freeze on to grain surfaces (Tafalla et al. 2004, Belloche & Andr\u00e9 2004, Bergin et\nal. 2002). This differential depletion was believed to be due\nto the adsorption energy of N2 being significantly lower\nthan those of other molecules, such as CO (see Bergin &\nLanger 1997); but recent measurements of the adsorption\nenergies of CO and N2 (Oberg et al. 2004) do not support\nthis interpretation. In order to solve this problem, a mechanism must be found which results in nitrogen\u2013containing\nspecies remaining in the gas phase at densities above 105\ncm\u22123 ; the gas\u2013phase chemistry must also be adequately\ndescribed under these conditions. We have considered the\nconsequences of reducing the sticking coefficient of N or\nN2 to values of the order of 0.1. Only when S(N2 ) = 0.1,\nwhilst retaining S = 1 for all other species, are the abundances of both NH3 and N2 H+ enhanced, relative to CO,\nduring the course of the collapse. However, we recognize\nthat the assumption of S(N2 ) \u2248 0.1 is ad hoc and needs\nexperimental verification.\n\nAppendix A: The rate coefficient for grain\ncoagulation\nWe assume that the velocity distribution of the population of grains is Gaussian and consider a collision between\ntwo grains, 1 and 2. The x-component of the velocity distribution of grain 1 is given by\n\u03c6(vx1 ) =\n\nh1\n\u03c0\n\n1\n2\n\n2 2\n\ne\u2212h1 vx1\n\nsuch that\nZ \u221e\n\u03c6(vx1 )dvx1 = 1\n\n(A.1)\n\n(A.2)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThus the probability that grain 1 has cartesian velocity\ncomponents in the ranges vx1 \u2192 vx1 + dvx1 , vy1 \u2192 vy1 +\ndvy1 , vz1 \u2192 vz1 + dvz1 is\np(vx1 , vy1 , vz1 ) dvx1 dvy1 dvz1 \u2261 \u03c6(vx1 ) \u03c6(vy1 ) \u03c6(vz1 ) dvx1 dvy1 dvz1\n\n\fD.R.

An expression completely\nanalogous to (A.3) holds for grain 2. Following Margenau\n& Murphy (1956), it may be shown that the probability\nof grain 1 having an x-component of velocity in the range\nvx1 \u2192 vx1 + dvx1 and grain 2 having an x-component of\nvelocity in the range vx2 \u2192 vx2 + dvx2 is\n\u03c6(vx1 ) \u03c6(vx2 ) dvx1 dvx2 =\n\nH\n1\n\n\u03c02\n\ne\u2212H\n\n2 2\nvx\n\ndvx\n\n(A.4)\n\nwhere\n1\n1\n2\n1\n= 2+ 2 = 2\nH2\nh1\nh2\nh\n\nof the population of grains is charged, may be seen to be\njustified as follows.\nThe grain population consists of neutral and singly\ncharged grains; of the latter, negatively charged grains\nare by far the most abundant. Consider the long\u2013range\nCoulomb interaction between two grains, each with a single negative charge; this repulsive potential is given by\nVCoul =\n\nmg =\n\nwhen h1 = h2 \u2261 h; vx = vx1 \u2212 vx2 is the relative xcomponent of velocity of the two grains. Analogous expressions hold for the y- and z-components of velocity.\nThus, the probability of finding the velocity components\nof the grains within the ranges specified above is\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nH\n1\n\n\u03c02\n\n\u00133\n\ne\u2212H\n\n2 2\n\nv\n\nvg \u2265\n(A.6)\n\nwhere v = v1 \u2212 v2 is the relative velocity of the grains 1\nand 2.

Taking ag = 0.05\u03bcm, which is the minimum\n(initial) value in the calculations reported in this paper,\nand \u03c1g = 2 g cm\u22123 , we obtain mg = 1.0\u00d710\u221215 g.

Thus, only a very\nsmall section of the velocity distribution, with vg <\n\u223c 10\ncm s\u22121 << \u2206v, is affected significantly by the Coulomb\ninteraction. The polarization potential between the grains\nis of shorter range and attractive; its asymptotic form is\n\nVpol = \u2212\n\ne2 a3g\n,\n2r4\n\nwhere a3g is the polarizability of a grain of radius ag .\nTaking into account this interaction would tend to enhance the cross section for coagulation of a neutral and\na charged grain; but arguments analogous to those immediately above show that the effect would be negligible for\nthe velocity distribution that we have adopted.\nFollowing Chokshi et al.
