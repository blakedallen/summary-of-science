We measured the luminescence spectra of the gamma ray irradiated\nsamples during warming to 370K using a spectrophotometer. For the forsterite and magnesite, the spectra exhibit\na rather intense peak at about 645 \u2013 655 nm and 660 nm respectively, whereas luminescence scarcely appeared\nin olivine sample.

Introduction\nInterstellar matter will be irradiated by electromagnetic\nenergy and several cosmic ray particles, such as gamma\nrays, neutrons, protons and heavy-ions etc. Irradiation\nwill cause some changes in these materials, especially to\ntheir optical properties. Investigation of this problem is\nexpected to advance our understanding of interstellar and\ncircumstellar matter. Especially, it is well known that extremely large fluxes of neutrons and gamma-rays have\nbeen emitted during super-nova explosions and during\nthe so called Hayashi-phase in the early stage of protostellar systems. Moreover, interplanetary-dust is often\nirradiated by gamma rays and fast neutrons during the\nperiods of flare activity on the sun, which is always repeated. Interstellar and circumstellar space is typically at\nextremely low temperature and is always irradiated over\ncosmological time-scale.\nThough little is known about irradiation environment\noutside of our solar system, it is natural to suppose that\nthere are the regions with sufficient strength of irradiation to cause thermoluminescences, for example, a region\nSend offprint requests to: K. Koike\n\nof not so extremely far from a super nova explosion or\nnot so far from a source of gamma ray emission, and/or\nlong time irradiation at extremely low temperature. The\neffect of this radiation will accumulate in the low temperature environment. It will be observed provided that the\ncondition to release the accumulated energy is realized in\ncircumstellar space.\nThe effects of irradiation on simple single crystals such\nas SiO2 , CaCO3 and CaF2 have been investigated by several authors (Nakagawa et al. 1988, Nakagawa et al. 1999)\nfrom the viewpoint of solid state physics or material science. However, irradiation of materials of interstellar matter has not been studied. It may then be worthwhile to\ninvestigate the effects of irradiation on simulated interstellar matter such as forsterite, enstatite and carbonates. Forsterite and enstatite have been found by many\nISO observations in both young and evolved stars and in\nour own solar system (Waters et al.1998, Malfait et al.\n1998, Wooden et al.1999). Carbonates such as dolomite\n(CaMg(CO3 )2 ), breunnerite (Mg(Fe, Mn)(CO3 )2 ), calcite\n(CaCO3 ), and Mg, Ca-bearing siderite (FeCO3 ) were\nfound in CI chondrite (Endress, Zinner and Bischoff 1996).\nEspecially, it should be noted that the broad emission fea-\n\n\f2\n\nK.

The sample is\nput on the thermally-isolated plate, which has previously\nbeen cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. The luminescence emission during warming is introduced to the CCD\nmeasuring system using an optically transparent fiber.\nThe color of forsterite changed to dark-white and -gray\n(rather dark red-violet) after gamma-ray irradiation. The\ntime of warming the samples from liquid nitrogen temperature to room temperature (333 K) is about 15 min. It\nshould be noted that this time length is sufficient to observe the thermoluminescence, that is, photon is emitted\nat the thermal equilibrium state.\nFig.1 shows the luminescence spectra of forsterite\n(Mg2 SiO4 ) after Gamma-ray irradiation. It shows a rather\nintense broad peak at about 645\u2013655 nm (and a weak\nbroad peak at 400\u2013440 nm), and a sharp peak at 610 nm.\nThe sharp peak at 610 nm appears as the sample warms\nfrom 200K to room temperature. Other weak peaks at 590,\n595, and 705 nm appear distinctly at above 200 K. The\nbroad peak at 645-655 nm becomes suddenly strongest at\n272 \u2013 307 K , and the weak peaks fade into background.\nAbove 307 K, the luminescence becomes weak gradually\nand another peaks at 595, 605, 705, 710 nm become prominent. The previous preliminary data of another sample of\nirradiated forsterite, its weight about 244 mg, have shown\nalmost the same luminescence spectra, but it seems that\nthe earliest luminescence starts at somewhat low temperature. Fig.2 shows the total strength of luminescence\nin Fig.1. A magnification of the emitted thermoluminescences spectrum of the most low-temperature at the range\nabout 164-200K in Fig.1 is shown in Fig.3.\nIn contrast, the luminescence is scarcely visible in natural olivine (from Egypt, Fo90 ). As for enstatite, we have\ndetect the luminescence spectra, which is shown in Fig.4.\nTwo broad peaks appear at about 545 and 760 nm, and\n\nFig. 7.

The weight of enstatite used was 114 mg, while\nthat of forsterite was 138 mg as mentioned before.\nFig.6 shows the measurement of luminescence spectra\nof magnesite MgCO3 after Gamma-ray irradiation. The\nspectrum of MgCO3 shows a very broad peak at about\n660nm, and this peak becomes strong at 350 \u2013 375 K. The\nirradiated magnesite is a bulk sample (about 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 2 mm\nsize) and its weight is 93 mg. It should be emphasized\nthat the thermoluminescence of MgCO3 also has sufficient strength to be visible easily. The color of magnesite\nchanged to a rather white-gray with pink-yellow tendency\nafter gamma-ray irradiation.\nWe have also measured the thermo-dependence of luminescence of calcite. The present luminescence of calcite is shown in Fig.7 and Fig.8. The intensity becomes\nstronger as temperature increased from 77 K, and the peak\nposition is 620-640 nm at 300 K. Above 300 K, the intensity became further stronger, and at 327 - 337 K the inten-\n\n\fK. Koike et al.: Thermoluminescence of Simulated Interstellar Matter after Gamma-ray Irradiation\n\n5\n\nFig. 8.

Higher\ntemperature than 337 K, the intensity became weak.\n\n3. Related problems and the other measurements\nWe also investigated the effect of irradiation on both a\nbulk sample and particle samples embedded in polyethylene using neutrons to a dose of 8 \u00d7 1016 nf /cm2 at 10 K\nand 70 K using the low-temperature irradiation facility of\nKyoto University Reactor (KUR-LTL: Low Temperature\nLoop)(Okada et al., 2001). After neutron irradiations of\n75 hour, samples are stored in liquid nitrogen for several\nmonths to wait a decay of radioactivity.\nWe measured the absorption coefficient of a neutronirradiated forsterite and enstatite particles using a FTIR\nspectrometer(Nicolet, Nexus 670) over the wavelength\nrange from 30 \u2013 100 \u03bcm. The samples were irradiated\nat 70 K using a neutrons in September, 2000. The gross\nfeature of spectrum show no apparent difference from the\nspectrum (Koike C. et al. 2000, 2000) taken before irradiation. One of the reasons for this result may be that the\nfast neutrons strongly collide with hydrogen atoms in the\npolyethylene and only weakly collide with sample particles\ndispersed in polyethylene.\nWe have also measured the thermoluminescence spectrum of neutron-irradiated bulk sample of forsterite, which\nis shown in Fig. 5. At low-temperature, two peaks appeared at about 450 and 650 nm, but above 253K one\npeak at 450nm became weak. The peak at 650nm is almost the same as Gamma-ray irradiated case, however,\nthe strength of luminescence is considerably weak. This\nreason is not known yet.\nFor future irradiation experiments using a stronger\nbeam of neutrons in the center of the reactor, we are interested in an accurate measurement of the impurity component in our forsterite sample, because impurity component with long a half period brings serious difficulties in\nmeasurements of irradiated samples. Previously, Takei and\nKobayashi ( 1974) reported that the spectrographic anal-\n\nFig. 9. Comparison with Observation Data of Red\nRectangle Spectrum (From Witt A.N. and Boroson T.A.\n1990) and Forsterite Spectrum (the right-side of Fig.1)\nysis shows that the forsterite sample is pure, but using\nneutron activation analysis, an infinitesimal quantity of Ir\nat about 16\u201318 wt ppm had been found. This level of Ir\nimpurity is below the detection limit of the spectrographic\nanalysis. We have also measured our sample using radio\nactivation analysis, and confirmed that our sample is almost pure; that is, other elements except for Mg, Si, O and\nan infinitesimal quantity of Ir are not detected.\n\n4. Similarity to ERE of Red Rectangle Spectrum\nIt is remarkable fact that the observed spectrum of ERE\n(Extended Red Emission) of the Red Rectangle (Witt and\nBoroson 1990) given in Fig. 9 shows characteristic feature.\nAs for carriers of ERE, possible size effect of crystalline\nsilicon nanoparticles has been discussed (Ledoux G. et al.\n2001). It has been shown that the photoluminescence spectra of these nanoparticles can explain the gross structure\nof ERE spectra, such as the peak position and the full\nwidth at half maximum of ERE spectra etc. However, evidence of existence of crystalline silicon has not yet been\nobserved. (Li and Draine 2001,2001)\nWe have interested that the luminescence of forsterite\nis very similar to ERE of Red Rectangle (peak at 652-684\nnm, half width 70-90 nm) among many objects. Generally,\nERE from interstellar dust consists of a broad, featureless emission band peaking at 610-820 nm, and width\n\n\f6\n\nK. Koike et al.: Thermoluminescence of Simulated Interstellar Matter after Gamma-ray Irradiation\n\n60-100 nm. Among many objects, Red Rectangle show\nstrong emission of one order stronger and exhibits the\ncharacteristic feature. Furthermore, crystalline silicates\nsuch as forsterite and PAH dust had been founded in\nRed Rectangle by ISO observations. The present irradiated forsterite also shows very strong luminescence (peak\nat 640-660 nm) at about 280-308 K and half width of\nabout 100 nm, and characteristic peaks at 590, 595, and\n705nm.\nIt should be also remembered that forsterite and enstatite have been found by many ISO observations in many\noxygen rich young and evolved stars. However, ERE is\nobserved in many carbon rich stars. It is important to\nnote that Red Rectangle is very interesting object with\nboth carbon and oxygen rich characteristics, that is, both\nforsterite and PAH were found. It should be emphasized\nthat our thermoluminescence spectrum of forsterite at\nabout 645\u2013655 nm and at 590 nm is very similar to the\nERE of the Red Rectangle.\n\n5. Discussion\nFor the irradiation circumstance, little is known around\nERE object. However, it should be noted that interstellar and circumstellar space is typically at extremely low\ntemperature and is always irradiated by electromagnetic\nradiation and by cosmic ray particles over cosmological\ntime-scale. Furthermore, it is well known that extremely\nlarge fluxes of neutrons and gamma-rays have been emitted during super-nova explosions. The effect of this radiation will accumulate in the low temperature environment.\nIt will only be observed provided that the condition to release the accumulated energy is realized in circumstellar\nspace. This may be occur when irradiated dust move to\na warmer domain in interstellar or circumstellar environment.\nThe accumulated energy in irradiated matter is released by thermoluminescence when the matter is warmed.\nThe rate of this release is dominated by Boltzman factor,\nand in extremely low temperature its rate is practically\ninfinite. In connection with this problem, it is interesting\nfact that the thermoluminescence spectrum of particles in\nTyrrhenian Sea exhibits the typical peak at the layer of\nyear 1054, 1006, 1181 etc., corresponding to the year of\nsuper-nova explosions (Castagnoli G. C. et al., 1982). In\ntheir estimate, the energy emitted during super-nova explosions of Crab nebula at year 1054 is about 1047 J and\nthe estimated flux of energy at the point of distance of the\nradius of the Galaxy is about 105 J/m2 .\nThough most energies of explosions are carried by neutrinos, a certain rate will be carried by X and gamma rays.\nIt will be possible in extremely low-temperature environment such as interstellar or circumstellar space, the effects\nof irradiation are \"frozen\" and almost stable in extremely\nlong time, and various irradiation effects, such as often observed super-nova explosions or always irradiated cosmic\nrays, are accumulated.\n\nThe irradiation on matter generally cause lattice defects of crystal, and a certain kind of this effect is observed\nin thermoluminescence. It is known in many experiences\nthat the irradiation effect on solid can be erased by annealing it to several hundred degrees. In other word, the\neffects of irradiation remains in a certain kind of form below this temperature and it may be observed still in effects\ndifferent from the thermoluminescence.\n\n6. Summary\nIn this paper, we report the data for gamma-ray irradiation of some simulated interstellar materials. Forsterite\n(Mg2 SiO4 ), enstatite (MgSiO3 ) and magnesite (MgCO3 )\nexhibit interesting thermoluminescences spectra.\nWe have emphasized that the thermoluminescence of\nforsterite appears at low temperature at about 160-200K.\nIn particular, it should be emphasized that the spectrum of forsterite at about 645\u2013655 nm and at 590 nm\nis very similar to the ERE of the Red Rectangle. (Witt\nand Boroson 1990) It should be noted that possible size\neffect of crystalline silicon nanoparticles can explain the\ngross structure of ERE spectra (Ledoux G. et al. 2001).\nHowever, this model can explain only the gross structure\nof spectrum of ERE, and seems not to explain the characteristic features of 590nm. The most interesting fact of\nsize effect is the peaks of gross structure of luminescence\nshifts depending on the size of nanoparticles. It is interesting problem to examine possible existence of similar effect\nin forsterite nanoparticles.\nFinally, the irradiation on matter is expected to cause\nvarious effects on matter in addition to thermoluminescence effects. Investigating these effects in the context of\nastrophysics is further problem.\nAcknowledgements.
