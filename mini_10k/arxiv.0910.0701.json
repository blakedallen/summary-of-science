If the pair of\nactions fulfils a symplectic Howe condition, we show that there is a canonical\ncorrespondence between the orbit spaces of the respective moment images.

In the K\u00e4hler case\nwe show that the linear representation of a pair of compact Lie groups on the\ngeometric quantization of the manifold is then equipped with a representationtheoretic Howe duality.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn representation theory, Howe duality ([How89]) is well-known. In the model\nsituation of a product G1 \u00d7 G2 of two compact connected Lie groups linearly represented on a finite dimensional complex vector space U (\u033a : G1 \u00d7 G2 \u2192 GL(U )),\nwe say that the representation satisfies the Howe condition or is equipped with\nc1 , the set of equivalence classes of\na Howe duality if there is a subset D of G\n\nsupported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Universit\u00e9 franco-allemande (DFHUFA) via the IRTG 1133 \"Geometry and Analysis of Symmetries\"\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\fc2\nirreducible complex representations of G1 , and an injective map \u039b : D \u2192 G\nsuch that\nM\nV\u03b1 \u2297 W\u039b(\u03b1) ,\n(\u2217)\nU\u223c\n=\n\u03b1\u2208D\n\nwhere V\u03b1 represents a class \u03b1 in D and W\u039b(\u03b1) represents the class \u039b(\u03b1). Denoting\nfor k = 1, 2 the restriction of the representation \u033a to Gk by \u033ak (as well as the\ncorresponding Lie algebra representation), condition (\u2217) is equivalent to\n(\u2217\u2217)\n\nZEnd(U ) (\u033ai (U gi )) = \u033aj (U gj )\n\nfor i 6= j,\n\nwhere U g is the universal enveloping algebra (over C) of a Lie algebra g, and\nfor a set S \u2286 End(U ), ZEnd(U ) (S) is the centralizer of S in the endomorphisms\nof U . This equivalence is easily shown using standard facts from representation\ntheory, as found, e. g., in [GW98]. Obviously, condition (\u2217) can be formulated\nfor representations on a complex vector space U having countable dimension\nand -upon passing to an appropriate completion on the right hand side- for\nrepresentations on Fr\u00e9chet or more general topological vector spaces.\nIn the spirit of quantization/dequantization of physical and mathematical\nstructures (going back to the correspondence principle of Niels Bohr, see [RN76]),\nattempts to find analogous notions in symplectic geometry have been made. This\nconcerns analogues of commutants (GV in [KKS78], polar actions in [OR04])\nand dual pair notions (as in [Wei83]), as well as the study of the orbit structure\nin particular cases like in, e. g., [Ada87]. In this article, we study the setting\nof commuting hamiltonian (proper) actions of two Lie groups on a symplectic\nmanifold. We define in this situation a symplectic Howe condition, naturally\ncorresponding to the above condition (\u2217\u2217), namely\nZC \u221e (M ) (\u03a6\u2217i C \u221e (g\u2217i )) = \u03a6\u2217j C \u221e (g\u2217j )\n\nfor i 6= j.\n\nHere and in the sequel, the Lie algebra of a Lie group G will always be denoted\nby g and, for A \u2286 C \u221e (M ), ZC \u221e (M ) (A) = {f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) | {f, a} = 0 \u2200a \u2208 A}.\nWe analyse thoroughly its consequences on the orbit structure, obtaining\nresults that refine those of [KKS78]. We then prove an orbit correspondence\nand show the conservation of integrality under the correspondence. Furthermore\nwe show that the Marsden-Weinstein reduced spaces of the action of one group\nare equivariantly symplectomorphic to coadjoint orbits in the moment image of\nthe other group action. To this setting we finally apply geometric quantization\nand obtain in the K\u00e4hler case a decomposition of the quantization of the initial\nsymplectic manifold as in (\u2217). That is, given a pair of commuting actions by\nholomorphic transformation groups on a K\u00e4hler manifold satisfying the symplectic Howe condition, the linear action of the pair on the holomorphic quantization\n(the holomorphic sections of the quantizing holomorphic line bundle) satisfies\nthe representation-theoretic Howe condition. In the last section we illustrate the\nresults with some simple but instructive examples.\n\n2\n\n\f2 Properties of Commuting Hamiltonian Actions\nThe setting throughout this article is a smooth connected symplectic manifold\n(M, \u03c9) on which two smooth actions of the Lie groups G1 and G2 are given.\nAssume these actions commute and are hamiltonian such that each action\nadmits an equivariant moment map \u03a6i : M \u2192 g\u2217i (i = 1, 2), i. e., they satisfy\nd\u03a6\u03bei = \u03c9(\u03c4i (\u03be), *) and \u03a6i (g * z) = Ad\u2217 (g)\u03a6i (z) \u2200z \u2208 M, g \u2208 Gi . Here, for any\n\u03be \u2208 gi , we denote by \u03c4i (\u03be) the fundamental vector field on M associated to \u03be and\nby \u03a6\u03bei the component of the i-moment map in direction \u03be. We first notice the\nfollowing easy lemma.\nLemma 2.1. Let (M, \u03c9) be a symplectic manifold. Let the Lie groups G1 and\nG2 act symplectically on M, admitting equivariant moment maps \u03a61 and \u03a62 .\nAssume these actions commute. Then the product group G1 \u00d7 G2 acts symplectically on M with an equivariant moment map, and notably for any \u03be \u2208 g1 and\nany \u03b7 \u2208 g2 the Poisson bracket of the moment components vanishes, i. e.,\nn\no\n\u03a6\u03be1 , \u03a6\u03b72 = 0.\nProof. Obvious.\nIn other words, the moment map of the first action is constant along the\nconnected components of the orbits of the second action, and vice versa. For G1\nand G2 (or, at least, their orbits) connected, this can be rephrased as\n\u03a6\u2217i C \u221e (g\u2217i ) \u2286 C \u221e (M )Gj\n\nfor i 6= j.\n\nHere we observe the inclusion of the collective functions for the first action\nin the set of invariants for the second action, and vice versa. Let us now observe\nthe following useful -and most certainly folkloristic- result.\nLemma 2.2. Let G be a connected Lie group and (M, \u03c9) a symplectic manifold.\nIf G acts symplectically with an equivariant moment map \u03a6 on M , then\nZC \u221e (M ) (\u03a6\u2217 C \u221e (g\u2217 )) = C \u221e (M )G .\nProof. Note that for f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) and \u03be \u2208 g, one has that \u03be M (f ) = {f, \u03a6\u03be } (where\n\u03be M = \u03c4 (\u03be) denotes the fundamental vector field on M associated to \u03be \u2208 g), and,\nfurthermore, if z \u2208 M , one has {f, \u03a6\u03be }(z) = \u2212 \u03be, Tz \u03a6(Xf |z ) where h*, *i is the\nnatural pairing between g and g\u2217 and \u03c9(Xf , *) = df , i. e., Xf is the hamiltonian\nvector field associated to f .\nGiven now f \u2208 C \u221e (M )G one has that for all z \u2208 M , Tz \u03a6(Xf |z ) = 0. If\nh \u2208 C \u221e (g\u2217 ) and z \u2208 M , we have\n{h \u25e6 \u03a6, f }(z) = d(h \u25e6 \u03a6)z (Xf |z ) = dh\u03a6(z) (Tz \u03a6(Xf |z )) = 0.\nOn the other hand, if f \u2208 ZC \u221e (M ) (\u03a6\u2217 C \u221e (g\u2217 )) and \u03be \u2208 g, then \u03be M (f ) =\n{f, \u03a6\u03be } = 0, and thus by the connectedness of G, f \u2208 C \u221e (M )G .\n\n3\n\n\fRemark 2.3. More subtle relations between centralizers of pullbacks via \u03a6 and\ninvariant functions are shown in [KL97] in the case that G is compact (often\nextending, in fact, to proper actions).\nWith the two preceding lemmata we immediately get that\n\u03a6\u2217i C \u221e (g\u2217i ) \u2286 ZC \u221e (M ) (\u03a6\u2217j C \u221e (g\u2217j ))\n\nfor i 6= j.\n\nEquality of the respective sets is obviously the classical analogue of (\u2217\u2217) upon interpreting \u03a6\u2217 C \u221e (g\u2217 ) as the \"classical collective observables (w. r. t. to a hamiltonian G-action on M )\" and \u033a(U g) as the \"quantum collective observables (w. r. t.\nto a linear G-representation)\". Therefore, it is natural to study the following\nsituation.\nDefinition 2.4. We say that two commuting hamiltonian actions satisfy the\nsymplectic Howe condition or form a symplectic Howe pair if\nZC \u221e (M ) (\u03a6\u2217i C \u221e (g\u2217i )) = \u03a6\u2217j C \u221e (g\u2217j )\n\nfor i 6= j\n\nis satisfied.\nRemark 2.5. The above condition is clearly close to the notions of dual pairs\npresented in Ch. 11 of [OR04]. However, we do not require the moment maps to\nbe submersions nor surjections when dealing with the symplectic Howe condition.\nAssuming further the properness of both actions, the symplectic Howe condition has the following important consequence for the orbit structure of these\ncommuting actions.\nProposition 2.6. Let commuting hamiltonian proper actions of the connected\nLie groups G1 and G2 with equivariant moment maps \u03a61 and \u03a62 be given on the\nsymplectic manifold (M, \u03c9). Then the symplectic Howe condition\nZC \u221e (M ) (\u03a6\u2217i C \u221e (g\u2217i )) = \u03a6\u2217j C \u221e (g\u2217j )\n\nfor i 6= j\n\n\u2200z \u2208 M holds \u03a6\u22121\ni (\u03a6i (z)) = Gj * z\n\nfor i 6= j,\n\nimplies that\n\ni. e., the levels sets of the moment maps of one action are the orbits of the other\none.\nProof. Let i, j \u2208 {1, 2} such that i + j = 3. Fix z \u2208 M and denote \u03a6\u22121\ni (\u03a6i (z)) =\nNz . By Lemma 2.1 and the connectedness of Gj , the Gj -action on M preserves\nthe subset Nz \u2286 M .\nAssume that Nz 6= Gj *z. Then there exists z \u2032 \u2208 Nz such that Gj *z \u2032 \u2229Gj *z = \u2205.\nSince the Gj -action is proper, there exists f \u2208 C \u221e (M )Gj such that f (z \u2032 ) 6= f (z)\n(separation of orbits by invariant functions follows easily from the slice theorem\nfor proper actions).\n\n4\n\n\fBy Lemma 2.2 and the symplectic Howe condition, we have\nC \u221e (M )Gj = ZC \u221e (M ) (\u03a6\u2217j C \u221e (g\u2217j )) = \u03a6\u2217i C \u221e (g\u2217i ),\ni. e., there is a smooth function h : g\u2217i \u2192 R such that f = h \u25e6 \u03a6i . Thus we\narrive at f (z \u2032 ) = h(\u03a6i (z \u2032 )) = h(\u03a6i (z)) = f (z), contradicting our assumption.\nConsequently, \u03a6i\u22121 (\u03a6i (z)) = Gj * z.\nKnowing the level sets of the moment maps as precisely as above permits to\nrelate the stabilizers of the actions on M and on the moment images \u03a6i (M ).\nLemma 2.7. Let G1 and G2 be Lie groups and (M, \u03c9) be a symplectic manifold.\nLet hamiltonian actions of both groups on M be given which commute, and denote\nthe equivariant moment maps by \u03a6i : M \u2192 g\u2217i . Let G12,z = {(g, g \u2032 ) \u2208 G1 \u00d7\nG2 | (g, g\u2032 ) * z = z} be the stabilizer of a point z \u2208 M under the simultaneous\naction of both groups, write H1,z and H2,z for the projections of G12,z to the\ngroups G1 and G2 .\nThen\n(i) H1,z is contained in G1,\u03a61 (z) , the stabilizer of the image of z under the\ncoadjoint action (i. e., G1,z \u2286 H1,z \u2286 G1,\u03a61 (z) ), and\n(ii) if, furthermore, the level sets of \u03a61 are actually G2 -orbits, then H1,z =\nG1,\u03a61 (z) .\nThe same statements hold for the indices 1 and 2 interchanged.\nProof. (i) Take g \u2208 H1,z , i. e., there exists g\u2032 \u2208 G2 such that (g, g\u2032 ) * z = z.\nFrom this one obtains\n\u03a61 (z) = \u03a61 ((g, g\u2032 ) * z) = g * \u03a61 ((e, g \u2032 ) * z) = g * \u03a61 (z),\nwhere G1 -equivariance and G2 -invariance of \u03a61 have been used.\n(ii) Now take g \u2208 G1,\u03a61 (z) , then \u03a61 (g * z) = \u03a61 (z), i. e., both z and g * z lie\nin a level set of \u03a61 , which is by assumption a G2 -orbit. Thus there exists\ng \u2032 \u2208 G2 such that (g, g \u2032 ) * z = z, which was to be shown.\nOf course, interchanging both actions does not alter the proof.\nThe particular orbit structure that we have described yields now a correspondence between the orbits in the images of the moment maps \u03a61 and \u03a62 .\nTheorem 2.8. Let commuting hamiltonian proper actions of the connected Lie\ngroups G1 and G2 with equivariant moment maps \u03a61 and \u03a62 be given on the\nsymplectic manifold (M, \u03c9).\nIf the symplectic Howe condition is satisfied, then:\n\n5\n\n\f(i) There is a bijection \u039b : \u03a61 (M )/G1 \u2192 \u03a62 (M )/G2 , given by\n\u039b(O\u03b11 ) = \u03a62 (\u03a6\u22121\n1 (O\u03b11 )),\nwhere \u03b11 \u2208 \u03a61 (M ), and O\u03b11 = Ad\u2217 (G1 )\u03b11 is seen as an element of\n\u03a61 (M )/G1 . To each pair (O\u03b11 , \u039b(O\u03b11 )) belongs a unique orbit (G1 \u00d7 G2 ) * z\n\u22121\nin M given by \u03a6\u22121\n1 (O\u03b11 ) = \u03a62 (O\u03b12 ). We say that orbits (G1 \u00d7 G2 ) * z,\nO\u03b11 and O\u03b12 are in correspondence if O\u03b12 = \u039b(O\u03b11 ) and (G1 \u00d7 G2 ) * z =\n\u22121\n\u03a6\u22121\n1 (O\u03b11 ) = \u03a62 (O\u03b12 ).\n(ii) If \u03a61 and \u03a62 are open maps, then \u039b is a homeomorphism. The same\nconclusion holds if the groups G1 and G2 both are compact and \u03a61 and \u03a62\nboth are closed maps. Finally, the same conclusion holds if for i + j = 3,\nGi is compact and \u03a6i is closed, and \u03a6j is open.\n\u22121\n(iii) Write M\u03b11 = \u03a6\u22121\n1 (\u03b11 )/G1,\u03b11 and M\u03b12 = \u03a62 (\u03b12 )/G2,\u03b12 for the respective\n\u2217\n\u2217\npoint reduced spaces at \u03b11 \u2208 g1 and \u03b12 \u2208 g2 . These spaces can be described\nas coadjoint orbits of the other action, i. e., there are, resp., G2 - and G1 equivariant symplectomorphisms\n\nM\u03b11 \u2192 \u039b(O\u03b11 )\n\nand\n\nM\u03b12 \u2192 \u039b\u22121 (O\u03b12 ).\n\n(iv) The symplectic reduced space M(\u03b11 ,\u03b12 ) for the joint action of G1 \u00d7 G2 is\neither a point (if O\u03b11 and O\u03b12 are in correspondence) or empty otherwise.\nProof. In order to simplify indices, some statements will only be proved for one\naction if the other case is analogous.\n(i) By Prop. 2.6, we know that for any z \u2208 M , the level sets of both moment\nmaps are orbits: \u03a6\u22121\ni (\u03a6i (z)) = Gj * z (i + j = 3). This implies that the\npreimage of any coadjoint orbit in either moment image \u03a6i (M ) (i = 1, 2)\nis exactly one orbit of the joint action of G1 \u00d7 G2 on M , i. e.,\n\u2217\n\u03a6\u22121\ni (Ad (Gi )\u03a6i (z)) = (G1 \u00d7 G2 ) * z,\n\nfrom which it follows that \u039b is well-defined and bijective.\n(ii) Note that all maps in the diagram\n\u03c01\n\u03a61 (M )/G1 o\n\n\u03a61 (M ) o\n\n\u03a61\n\nM\n\n\u03a62\n\n/ \u03a62 (M )\n\n\u03c02\n\n/ \u03a62 (M )/G2\n\nare continuous, and \u03c01 and \u03c02 are always open as well.\nLet us denote \u039b : \u03a61 (M )/G1 \u2192 \u03a62 (M )/G2 by \u039b12 and its set-theoretic\ninverse by \u039b21 . If \u03a61 is open, then for U open in \u03a62 (M )/G2 we have\n\u22121\nthat \u039b21 (U ) = (\u03c01 \u25e6 \u03a61 )(\u03a6\u22121\n2 (\u03c02 (U ))) is an open set, i. e., \u039b12 is continuous. Similarly, if G1 is compact and \u03a61 is closed, we have for A closed in\n\u03a62 (M )/G2 that \u039b21 (A) is closed as well, i. e., again \u039b12 is continuous.\nThe conclusions of (ii) follow easily.\n\n6\n\n\f(iii) Let z \u2208 M and \u03b12 = \u03a62 (z) its value under the moment map of the second\naction. Consider the restricted map \u03a62|G2 *z : G2 * z \u2192 O\u03b12 , and recall that\nG2 * z = \u03a6\u22121\n1 (\u03b11 ) for \u03b11 = \u03a61 (z). Recall from Lemma 2.7 that G1,\u03b11 =\n{h \u2208 G1 | \u2203g \u2208 G2 : (h, g) * z = z}. This group acts on G2 * z and one has\nM\u03b11 = G2 * z/G1,\u03b11 . Thus \u03a62|G2 *z induces\n\u03a6\u03032 : M\u03b11 \u2192 O\u03b12 ,\nwhich inherits from \u03a62 smoothness and G2 -equivariance. It is clearly surjective and we now show that it is injective: Take \u03b1 \u2208 O\u03b12 , z\u03031 , z\u03032 \u2208 G2 *z/G1,\u03b11\nso that \u03b1 = \u03a6\u03032 (z\u03031 ) = \u03a6\u03032 (z\u03032 ). Now fixing preimages z1 , z2 \u2208 G2 * z of\nz\u03031 , z\u03032 , they have the property \u03a62 (z1 ) = \u03a62 (z2 ), and for some h \u2208 G1 ,\nz2 = h * z1 holds because the level sets of \u03a62 are G1 -orbits. However,\nz2 = g * z1 for some g \u2208 G2 , which implies by part (ii) of Lemma 2.7\nthat h \u2208 G1,\u03b11 . Therefore, z\u03031 = z\u03032 , and \u03a6\u03032 is a bijection. Applying\nSard's Theorem, one notices that a smooth equivariant bijection between\nfinite-dimensional homogeneous spaces has a smooth inverse. Thus \u03a6\u03032\nis a G2 -equivariant diffeomorphism and it remains to show that \u03a6\u03032 is\na symplectomorphism. Denote by iG2 *z : G2 * z \u2192 M the inclusion of\nG2 * z = \u03a6\u22121\n1 (\u03b11 ) into the ambient manifold. We observe that the equivariance properties of \u03a62 imply i\u2217G2 *z \u03c9 = (\u03a62|G2 *z )\u2217 \u03c9 O\u03b12 , where \u03c9 O\u03b12 is the KKS\nsymplectic form (see, e. g., [OR04], Thm. 4.5.31). But the symplectic form\n\u03c9 M\u03b11 on M\u03b11 is defined such that it also pulls back to i\u2217G2 *z \u03c9 = p\u2217 \u03c9 M\u03b11 ,\nvia the quotient map p : G2 * z \u2192 G2 * z/G1,\u03b11 . Consequently we have\np\u2217 \u03c9 M\u03b11 = (\u03a62|G2 *z )\u2217 \u03c9 O\u03b12 = p\u2217 (\u03a6\u0303\u22172 \u03c9 O\u03b12 ). Since p is a surjective submersion,\nthe coincidence of the pullbacks (to G2 * z) implies that \u03c9 M\u03b11 = \u03a6\u0303\u22172 \u03c9 O\u03b12 ,\nwhich was to be shown.\n(iv) Let \u03a6 = \u03a61 \u2295 \u03a62 . Take \u03b11 \u2208 g\u22171 and \u03b12 \u2208 g\u22172 . Then\n\u03a6\u22121 (O\u03b11 \u00d7 O\u03b12 )\nis empty if O\u03b12 6= \u039b(O\u03b11 ). Otherwise, for any z \u2208 M such that \u03a61 (z) \u2208 O\u03b11\nand \u03a62 (z) \u2208 O\u03b12 , holds\n\u03a6\u22121 (O\u03b11 \u00d7 O\u03b12 )/(G1 \u00d7 G2 ) \u223c\n= (G1 \u00d7 G2 ) * z/(G1 \u00d7 G2 ).\nThis quotient is, of course, a point.\n\nRemark 2.9. (1) Statement (i) is a special case of the singular symplectic\nleaf correspondence of Thm. 11.4.4 in [OR04], but here obtained from the\nsymplectic Howe condition on the pair of groups actions, in a spirit close\nto the non-singular correspondence of Thm. 11.1.9 of the same reference.\n(2) Take any z \u2208 M and \u03b11 = \u03a61 (z). Then the global ineffectivity of the\nG1,\u03b11 -action on the \u03a61 -level containing z is I1,\u03b11 = {g1 \u2208 G1,\u03b11 | g1 * z \u2032 =\n\n7\n\n\fz \u2032 \u2200z \u2032 \u2208 \u03a6\u22121\n1 (\u03b11 )}, i. e., the intersection of the stabilizers of all points in\nthe level set. Here, \u03a6\u22121\n1 (\u03b11 ) = G2 * z, hence G1,z \u2032 = G1,z \u2286 I1,\u03b11 for all\nz \u2032 \u2208 \u03a6\u22121\n(\u03b1\n),\nso\nI\n1\n1,\u03b11 = G1,z . Therefore, the proper action of G1,\u03b11 on\n1\n\u22121\n\u03a61 (\u03b11 ) factorizes over a free and proper action of G1,\u03b11 /I1,\u03b11 , and thus\nthe quotient is a smooth manifold.\n(3) Part (iv) of the preceding theorem implies that the (G1 \u00d7 G2 )-action on\nM is multiplicity-free, i. e., C \u221e (M )G1 \u00d7G2 is a commutative Poisson algebra\n(compare [GS84] and [HW90]). This can also be directly deduced from the\ndefinition of a symplectic Howe pair and Lemma 2.2.\n\n3\n\nPrequantization of Symplectic Howe Pairs\n\nWe are now going to show that the orbit correspondence which was constructed\nabove behaves well under geometric prequantization. The first step is to show\nthat the integrality of coadjoint orbits is preserved under the correspondence.\nTo achieve this, we make use of having proved that the reduced spaces coincide\nin our setting with coadjoint orbits. Let us recall the following fact (Thm. 3.2 of\n[GS82]).\nTheorem 3.1. Let G be a compact connected Lie group and (M, \u03c9) be a prequantizable symplectic manifold with hamiltonian G-action, equivariant moment map\n\u03a6 and line bundle L(M ) equipped with a connection \u2207 on L(M ) whose curvature\ncoincides with \u03c9. If the G-action on the level set \u03a6\u22121 (0) is free, then the reduced\nspace M0 = \u03a6\u22121 (0)/G is a manifold and there exists a unique line bundle L(M0 )\nover M0 such that\n\u03c0 \u2217 L(M0 ) = i\u2217 L(M ) and \u03c0 \u2217 \u22070 = i\u2217 \u2207,\nwhere \u03c0 : \u03a6\u22121 (0) \u2192 \u03a6\u22121 (0)/G is the quotient map and i : \u03a6\u22121 (0) \u2192 M the\ninclusion.\nNotation. If (M, \u03c9) is a prequantizable symplectic manifold, i. e., \u03c9 is an integral\nform, we denote by L(M, \u03c9) a corresponding prequantum line bundle, i. e., a\ncomplex line bundle with first de Rham Chern class equal to [\u03c9]. This line bundle\nis unique if there exist no torsion line bundles on M . We may omit \u03c9 if there is\nno ambiguity about the symplectic form. For a coadjoint orbit O\u03b1 , we will write\nL\u03b1 = L(O\u03b1 ), the KKS symplectic form \u03c9 O\u03b1 being understood.\nBy the shifting trick, any reduced space may be regarded as a reduced space at\n0. More precisely, one has the following well-known result (see, e. g., Thm. 6.5.2\nin [OR04]).\nTheorem 3.2. Let G be a compact connected Lie group and (M, \u03c9) be a prequantizable symplectic manifold with hamiltonian G-action and equivariant moment map \u03a6. If G\u03b1 acts freely on \u03a6\u22121 (\u03b1), then the reduced space at \u03b1 \u2208 g\u2217 ,\n\u03a6\u22121 (\u03b1)/G\u03b1 , is symplectomorphic to the reduction of M \u00d7 O\u03b1\u2212 at 0, where O\u03b1\u2212\n\n8\n\n\fdenotes the coadjoint orbit through \u03b1 with the KKS symplectic form multiplied\nby \u22121.\nReturning to the setting of Theorem 2.8, we conclude that any reduced space\nM\u03b11 admits a line bundle L(M\u03b11 ) if the coadjoint orbit O\u03b11 does. Recall from\nRemark 2.9(2) that the quotient of \u03a6\u22121\n1 (\u03b11 ) by G1,\u03b11 is also given as the quotient\nby the free (G1,\u03b11 /I1,\u03b11 )-action on \u03a6\u22121\n1 (\u03b11 ) and hence M\u03b11 is smooth. Therefore,\nwe can adapt Theorem 3.1 to this \u0010\nquotient.\n\u0011\u2217 Using the symplectomorphism \u03a6\u03032 :\n\u22121\nM\u03b11 \u2192 O\u03b12 , we obtain the bundle \u03a6\u03032\nL(M\u03b11 ) over O\u03b12 . As coadjoint orbits\nof compact connected Lie groups are simply connected, there are no non-trivial\nflat vector bundles, hence no torsion line bundles over them. Therefore, for\nany \u03b1\u00111 such that (O\u03b11 , \u03c9 O\u03b11 ) is an integral symplectic manifold, the bundle\n\u0010\n\u2217\n\n\u03a6\u0303\u22121\nL(M\u03b11 ) is the unique prequantum line bundle over O\u03b12 . Thus we have\n2\nproved:\n\nProposition 3.3. Let O\u03b11 and O\u03b12 be two coadjoint orbits in correspondence\nas in Thm. 2.8(i) and assume furthermore that G1 and G2 are compact. Then\n(O\u03b11 , \u03c9 O\u03b11 ) is an integral symplectic manifold if and only if (O\u03b12 , \u03c9 O\u03b12 ) is an\nintegral symplectic manifold, too.\nRemark 3.4. Let us recall that for G a compact connected semisimple Lie group\nand \u03b1 \u2208 g\u2217 , O\u03b1 is an integral symplectic manifold if and only if there exists a\ncharacter \u03c7\u03b1 : G\u03b1 \u2192 U (1) such that (\u03c7\u03b1 )\u2217e = 2\u03c0i\u03b1. Thus one defines:\nDefinition 3.5. (1) Let G be a compact connected Lie group and \u03b1 \u2208 g\u2217 . We\ncall \u03b1 integral if there exists \u03c7\u03b1 : G\u03b1 \u2192 U (1) such that (\u03c7\u03b1 )\u2217e = 2\u03c0i\u03b1.\n(2) If \u03b1 is integral, we call O\u03b1 an integral orbit.\nRemark 3.6. Of course, there is a natural bijection between the set of integral\norbits and the set of dominant weights of G (w. r. t. a fixed Weyl chamber t+ ).\nWe observe that integral coadjoint orbits are integral symplectic manifolds\nbut the converse statement is not true in general because of the possible presence\nof a positive-dimensional centre. Accordingly, we need to refine Proposition 3.3.\nLet us from now on assume that the (G1 \u00d7 G2 )-action on M comes with a\nfixed \"linearization on L\", i. e., there is given a fibrewise linear (G1 \u00d7 G2 )-action\non L = L(M, \u03c9) covering the (G1 \u00d7 G2 )-action on M . This is no restriction if\none accepts to replace G1 and G2 by finite coverings (see [Dui96], Prop. 15.4).\nTheorem 3.7. Let O\u03b11 and O\u03b12 be two coadjoint orbits in correspondence as in\nThm. 2.8(i) and assume furthermore that G1 and G2 are compact. Then O\u03b11 is\nintegral if and only if O\u03b12 is integral.\nProof. Let \u03b1 \u2208 g\u22171 be integral. Since the G2 -actions on M and L commute with\nthe G1 -actions, the G2 -action on L descends canonically to a G2 -action on the\nline bundle L(M\u03b11 ) covering the natural G2 -action on M\u03b11 .\n\n9\n\n\fUsing the G2 -equivariant symplectomorphism \u03a6\u03032 : (M\u03b11 , \u03c9 M\u03b11 ) \u2192 (O\u03b12 , \u03c9 O\u03b12 )\n\u2217\nfrom above, we have the bundle (\u03a6\u0303\u22121\n2 ) L(M\u03b11 ) = L(O\u03b12 ) together with a G2 invariant connection \u2207 given by pulling back the G2 -invariant connection induced\non L(M\u03b11 ) by a (G1 \u00d7 G2 )-invariant connection on L \u2192 M . (See [GS82] for the\nconstruction of the connection on L(M\u03b11 ).) We thus arrive at the following\ncommuting diagram (where p denotes the bundle projection and L(O\u03b12 )\u03b12 =\np\u22121 (\u03b12 )):\nG2 \u00d7 L(O\u03b12 )\n\n/ L(O\u03b1 )\n2\np\n\nid \u00d7p\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\nG2 \u00d7 O\u03b12\n\n/ O\u03b1 ,\n2\n\nyielding a homomorphism \u03c7 : G2,\u03b12 \u2192 U (L(O\u03b12 )\u03b12 ) = U (1).\nIt remains to show that \u03c7 = \u03c7\u03b12 , i. e., \u03c7\u2217e = 2\u03c0i\u03b12 . Since the G2 -action on\nL(O\u03b12 ) and the connection \u2207 come from the reduced bundle with connection\nL(M\u03b11 ) and this comes in turn from a connection on L \u2192 M , we have the\nusual \"Kostant formula\" for the fundamental vector fields of the G2 -action on\nL(O\u03b12 ) =\nL(O\u03b12 ). (Compare\nD\nE[Kos70], Thm. 4.5.1.) More precisely, given \u03be \u2208 g2 , \u03be\nO\u03b12 + p\u2217 ( \u03a6O\u03b12 , \u03be )(2\u03c0i)L(O\u03b12 ) , where \u03be N denotes the fundamental vector field\n\u03be]\n2\n\ne denotes the \u2207-horizontal lift of a vector\nassociated to \u03be on a G2 -manifold N , X\n\u223c\nfield X on O\u03b12 to L(O\u03b12 ), 2\u03c0i \u2208 iR = u(1) also hasDa fundamental\nvector field on\nE\nO\u03b12\nthe bundle by the canonical U (1)-action on it, and \u03a62 , \u03be is the \u03be-component\nof the G2 -moment map on O\u03b12 .\nFor \u03be \u2208 g2,\u03b12 , the field \u03be L(O\u03b12 ) is now tangent to the p-fibre L(O\u03b12 )\u03b12 over\n\u03b12 and equals there (2\u03c0i)L(O\u03b12 ) h\u03b12 , \u03bei. Thus \u03c7\u2217e : G2,\u03b12 \u2192 U (1) is equal to\nd\n2\u03c0ih\u03b12 ,\u03beit = 2\u03c0ih\u03b1 , \u03bei.\n2\ndt 0 e\n\n4 Geometric Quantization of Symplectic Howe\nPairs\nIn this section we show that the symplectic Howe condition for the actions on M\nimplies the representation-theoretic Howe condition for the linear representation\non the geometric quantization of (M, \u03c9) in the K\u00e4hler case. Thus we assume\nthroughout this section that (M, \u03c9) is K\u00e4hler, i. e., there is given a complex\nstructure J such that the associated riemannian metric g(*, *) = \u03c9(*, J*) is positive definite and hermitean. Furthermore we assume that the acting groups are\ncompact and connected and that the moment maps are admissible in the sense\nof [Sja95] (p. 109).\nDefinition 4.1. Let G be a compact connected Lie group acting holomorphically\non a K\u00e4hler manifold M with equivariant moment map \u03a6. Choose a G-invariant\ninner product on g with corresponding norm and define the function \u03bc = k\u03a6k2 .\n\n10\n\n\fLet Ft be the gradient flow of \u2212\u03bc. A moment map is called admissible if for\nevery z \u2208 M , the path of steepest descent Ft (z) through z (t \u2265 0) is contained\nin a compact set.\nRemark 4.2. Examples of admissible moment maps are all proper moment maps\nand the moment map of the natural linear U (n)-action on Cn .\nOne then has the following result (Thm. 2.20 of [Sja95]).\nTheorem 4.3. Let G be a compact connected Lie group acting holomorphically\non a K\u00e4hler manifold M with admissible equivariant moment map \u03a6. Suppose\nthis action extends to an action of the complexification GC of G. Then for every\ndominant weight \u03b1 of G, the space of holomorphic sections \u0393hol (M\u03b1 , L\u03b1 ) of the\nprequantum line bundle L\u03b1 over the symplectic reduced space M\u03b1 is naturally\nisomorphic to HomG (V\u03b1 , \u0393hol (M, L)), the space of intertwining operators from the\nirreducible representation V\u03b1 with highest weight \u03b1 to the quantization \u0393hol (M, L)\nof M .\nRemark 4.4. (1) Of course, dominance of a weight (an analytically integral\nelement of t\u2217 ) is defined w. r. t. the choice of a Weyl chamber. It is introduced in the statement of the preceding theorem only to avoid redundancy\nsince one has MAd\u2217 (g)\u03b1 \u223c\n= M\u03b1 and VAd\u2217 (g)\u03b1 \u223c\n= V\u03b1 . Thus one may write here\n\u2217\nintegral point of g in the sense of Def. 3.5 as well.\n(2) The reduced spaces M\u03b1 inherit, also in the singular case, \"sufficient\" structure in order to define holomorphic sections of L\u03b1 \u2192 M\u03b1 (compare [Sja95]).\nBy Theorem 2.8 and Remark 2.9(2) the reduced spaces occurring in our\n\"symplectic Howe setting\" are always smooth. Thus, in fact, we do not\nneed the results of Sjamaar in its full generality.\n(3) If \u03b1, interpreted as an element of g\u2217 , is not in the moment image \u03a6(M ),\nthen \u0393hol (M\u03b1 , L\u03b1 ) is to be interpreted as {0}. Theorem 4.3 then says that\nV\u03b1 does not occur in the G-decomposition of \u0393hol (M, L).\nTake now the simultaneous G1 \u00d7G2 -action introduced in the previous section.\nBy the Borel-Weil theorem, the geometric quantizations, V\u03b1i \u223c\n= \u0393hol (O\u03b1i , L\u03b1i )\nwith \u03b1i integral, realize the irreducible representations of Gi , thus \u0393hol (O\u03b11 \u00d7\nO\u03b12 , L\u03b11 \u22a0 L\u03b12 ) the irreducibles for G1 \u00d7 G2 . Here L\u03b11 \u22a0 L\u03b12 \u2192 M1 \u00d7 M2 is\ngiven as p\u22171 (L\u03b11 ) \u2297 p\u22172 (L\u03b12 ) with pj : M1 \u00d7 M2 \u2192 Mj denoting the j-th projection\nfor j = 1, 2. Now,\nHomG1 \u00d7G2 (\u0393hol (O\u03b11 \u00d7 O\u03b12 , L\u03b11 \u22a0 L\u03b12 ), \u0393hol (M, L))\n\u0001\n\u223c\n= \u0393hol \u03a6\u22121 (O\u03b11 \u00d7 O\u03b12 )/(G1 \u00d7 G2 ), L(\u03b11 ,\u03b12 ) .\nBy Thm. 2.8(iv), the reduced space may be empty (if the coadjoint orbits are\nnot in correspondence), hence the space of sections \u0393hol (\u03a6\u22121 (O\u03b11 \u00d7 O\u03b12 )/(G1 \u00d7\nG2 ), L(\u03b11 ,\u03b12 ) ) is trivial; otherwise the reduced space is a point and the space\n\n11\n\n\fof sections is simply C. So, one concludes for the multiplicities of G1 \u00d7 G2 representations in the quantization of M :\ndim HomG1 \u00d7G2 (\u0393hol (O\u03b11 \u00d7 O\u03b12 , L\u03b11 \u22a0 L\u03b12 ), \u0393hol (M, L)) \u2264 1,\nthe equal sign being true if and only if O\u03b12 = \u039b(O\u03b11 ).\n\nInterpreting the line bundles L\u03b11 , L\u03b12 and L\u03b11 \u22a0 L\u03b12 as sheaves and their\nholomorphic sections as their zeroth cohomology group, one concludes from a\nstandard K\u00fcnneth formula (compare [SW59] and [Kau67]) that\n\u0393hol (O\u03b11 \u00d7 O\u03b12 , L\u03b11 \u22a0 L\u03b12 ) \u223c\n= \u0393hol (O\u03b11 , L\u03b11 ) \u2297 \u0393hol (O\u03b12 , L\u03b12 ).\nRecall that by 2.8(iii), the coadjoint G2 -orbit corresponding via \u039b to O\u03b11 \u2208\n\u03a61 (M )/G1 is symplectomorphic to the orbit reduced space of O\u03b11 , i. e.,\n\u039b(O\u03b11 ) \u223c\n= \u03a6\u22121\n1 (O\u03b11 )/G1 = M\u03b11 .\nThis implies that the multiplicity space of one action is an irreducible representation of the other action, i. e., for O\u03b12 = \u039b(O\u03b11 ), one has G2 -equivariantly\nHomG1 (V\u03b11 , \u0393hol (M, L)) \u223c\n= \u0393hol (M\u03b11 , L(M\u03b11 )) \u223c\n= \u0393hol (O\u03b12 , L\u03b12 ).\nck , the set of equivalence classes\nLet us identify in the sequel (for k = 1, 2) G\nof irreducible complex representations of finite dimension of Gk , with (tk )+\nZ the\n\u2217 of a maximal abelian\nintegral points in a fixed Weyl chamber t+\nin\nthe\ndual\nt\nk\nk\nsubalgebra tk \u2286 gk .\nThe preceding statements can be summarized as follows.\nTheorem 4.5. Let G1 and G2 be compact connected Lie groups acting by holomorphic transformations on a K\u00e4hler manifold M such that the actions extend\nto actions of the respective complexified groups. Suppose that the actions of G1\nand G2 commute and are hamiltonian with admissible equivariant moment maps\n\u03a61 and \u03a62 . Denote by L the prequantum line bundle over M .\nAssume the symplectic Howe condition to be satisfied. Then:\n\u0393hol (M, L) \u223c\n=\n\nM\nd\n\n\u0393hol (O\u03b11 , L\u03b11 ) \u2297 \u0393hol (O\u03b12 , L\u03b12 ),\n\nc1\n\u03b11 \u2208\u03a61 (M )\u2229G\n\nwhere \u039b is the orbit correspondence map and O\u03b12 = \u039b(O\u03b11 ).\nL\nRemark 4.6. (1) In the preceding theorem the symbol c of course signifies\nthe completion of the algebraic direct sum in the Fr\u00e9chet topology of the\nspace of holomorphic sections of L.\nc1 to G\nc2 , is injective the represen(2) Since \u039b, viewed as a map from \u03a61 (M ) \u2229 G\ntation \u0393hol (M, L) of the pair (G1 , G2 ) satisfies the representation-theoretic\nHowe condition (\u2217) recalled in the introduction.\n\n12\n\n\f(3) Let (M, \u03c9) be a compact complex manifold together with an integral K\u00e4hler\nform and L \u2192 M a prequantizing holomorphic line bundle. Let furthermore\nthe connected compact Lie groups G1 and G2 act by holomorphic transformations and in a hamiltonian fashion on M . If this pair of actions satisfies\nthe symplectic Howe condition, the preceding theorem applies, i. e., their\ninduced linear representation on the \"holomorphic quantization\" \u0393hol (M, L)\nis equipped with a Howe duality.\n\n5\n\nExamples\n\nIn this section we give some simple but instructive examples of pairs of symplectic\nactions fulfilling the symplectic Howe condition. In each case, we explicitly give\nthe orbit correspondence map and the Howe duality map associated to the linear\nrepresentation of the pair of groups on the geometric quantization space.\n\n5.1\n\n(U (n), U (m)) on Mat(n\u00d7m; C)\n\nLet M = Mat(n\u00d7m; C) be the n\u00d7m matrices with complex entries equipped\nwith the symplectic structure \u03c9(A, B) = Im tr(\u0100T B) and the natural actions of\nG1 = U (n) and G2 = U (m): U (n) \u00d7 U (m) \u00d7 M \u2192 M, ((U, V ), z) 7\u2192 U zV \u22121 .\nAssume that n \u2265 m \u2265 1. The (equivariant) moment maps corresponding to\nthese actions are given by \u03a6\u03be1 (z) = \u2212 12 Im tr(\u03bezz\u0304 T ) (for \u03be \u2208 u(n)) and \u03a6\u03b72 (z) =\n1\nT\n2 Im tr(\u03b7z\u0304 z) (for \u03b7 \u2208 u(m)). Direct inspection shows that any level set of \u03a61 is\nexactly one U (m)-orbit. Using standard facts from invariant theory and a theorem of G. Schwarz (see [Sch75], Thm. 1) one obtaines that the space of pullbacks\nof smooth functions on g\u22171 under \u03a61 coincides with the algebra of G2 -invariant\nsmooth functions on M , and thus by Lemma 2.2 with the centralizer of the \u03a62 pullback of C \u221e (g\u22172 ) in the Poisson algebra C \u221e (M ). The analogous statements\nhold if the roles of the two groups are reversed. Therefore, the symplectic Howe\ncondition is satisfied.\nIn order to state the orbit correspondence\nany z \u2208 M can be written z = U \u03a3V for\n\uf8eb\n\u03c31 0\n\uf8ec 0 \u03c32\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec ..\n..\n\uf8ec.\n.\n\u03a3 = \u03a3(\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3m ) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec0 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0 0\n\uf8ed\n..\n..\n.\n.\n\nof Thm. 2.8 explicitly, recall that\n***\n***\n..\n.\n***\n***\n..\n.\n\n0\n0\n..\n.\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 \u2208 M,\n\u03c3m \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n..\n.\n\nwhere \u03c31 \u2265 \u03c32 \u2265 . . . \u2265 \u03c3m \u2265 0 and U \u2208 U (n), V \u2208 U (m) are determined up to\nan element of the stabilizer of \u03a3. The set S = {\u03c3 = (\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3m )|\u03c31 > \u03c32 > . . . >\n\u03c3m > 0} parametrizes thus all U (n) \u00d7 U (m)-orbits of maximal dimension and\n\n13\n\n\fits closure S\u0304 all U (n) \u00d7 U (m)-orbits. Identifying the adjoint and the coadjoint\naction of a unitary group via the usual trace form isomorphism (\u03b6 7\u2192 tr(* \u03b6))\ne 2 (z) = \u2212 i z\u0304 T z fulfilling \u03a6\u03be (z) = tr(\u03be * \u03a6\ne 1 (z)) and\ne 1 (z) = i zz\u0304 T and \u03a6\nwe get \u03a6\n1\n2\n2\n\u03b7\ne 2 (z)). Denoting furthermore the diagonal element of u(N ) with\n\u03a62 (z) = tr(\u03b7 * \u03a6\nentries i(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbN ) by [\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbN ] or simply by [\u03bb] we have here the following\norbit correspondence map:\nU (m)\n\nU (n)\n\n\u039b : O[ 1 \u03c32 ,..., 1 \u03c32 ,0,...,0] 7\u2192 O[\u2212 1 \u03c32 ,...,\u2212 1 \u03c32 ] .\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\nm\n\n2 1\n\n2\n\nm\n\nObserve that orbits of any dimension are included in this statement and no restriction to the principal orbit type is necessary. For the sake of brevity we write\n[\u03b1, 0] for [\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m , 0, . . . , 0] in the sequel.\nNow, we may apply Thm. 4.5 and obtain, since the prequantum line bundle\nL over M is holomorphically trivial,\nHol(M ) = \u0393hol (M, L) =\n\nM\nd\n\n\u0393hol (O[\u03b1,0] , L[\u03b1,0] ) \u2297 \u0393hol (O[\u2212\u03b1] , L[\u2212\u03b1] )\n\nM\nd\n\nV[\u03b1,0] \u2297 V[\u03b1]\n\nU (m)\n\nU (n)\n\n\u03b1\u2208S\u0304 integral\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u03b1\u2208S\u0304 integral\n\n\u0001\u2217\n\n,\n\nwhere for \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbN ) (with \u03bb1 , . . . \u03bbn integral and \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 . . . \u2265\n\u03bbN ), V[\u03bb] is the irreducible U (N )-representation associated to the orbit through\ni(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbN ) either by the orbit method or equivalently\u0001by the highest-weight\n\u2217\nprocedure. The ensuing Howe duality map, V[\u03b1,0] 7\u2192 V[\u03b1] , is then essentially a\nrestatement of the well-known GL(n)-GL(m)-duality (compare, e. g., Thm. 5.2.7\nin [GW98]) on the space of holomorphic polynomials on M .\n\n5.2\n\n(G, G) on T \u2217G\n\nGiven a Lie group G, the left and right action of G on itself of course lift to\nits cotangent bundle T \u2217 G. Both actions are free and proper, but this is not in\ngeneral true for the product. Trivializing T \u2217 G via the right action, the left resp.\nright action reads as follows: (g, \u03b1) 7\u2192 (hg, Ad\u2217 (h)\u03b1) and (g, \u03b1) 7\u2192 (gh\u22121 , \u03b1), respectively. Furthermore, the moment maps are then given by \u03a61 : (g, \u03b1) 7\u2192 \u03b1 and\n\u03a62 : (g, \u03b1) 7\u2192 \u2212 Ad\u2217 (g\u22121 )\u03b1 for the left and right action, respectively. Obviously,\nthe \u03a61 -fibres are right-G-orbits and the \u03a62 -fibres left-G-orbits. For connected G\nthe symplectic Howe condition can easily be verified using Lemma 2.2; the orbit\ncorrespondence is \u039b : O\u03b1 7\u2192 O\u2212\u03b1 .\nRestricting now to the case that G is compact and connected, T \u2217 G can be\nidentified with the affine K\u00e4hler manifold GC (see, e. g., Sect. 3 in [Hal97]) and\nthe holomorphic geometric quantization Hol(GC ) has the same (G \u00d7 G)-finite\nvectors as the representation on L2 (G). In this situation, Thm. 4.5 specializes\nthus to the Peter-Weyl theorem.\n\n14\n\n\f5.3\n\n(U (1), U (n)) on Pn (C)\n\nThe standard U (n+1)-action on Pn (C) preserves the complex structure and the\nscaled Fubini-Study K\u00e4hler form k\u03c9 FS (k \u2208 N\\{0}), and possesses the following\nequivariant moment map (for \u03b6 \u2208 u(n+1)):\ni hz, \u03b6 * zi\n.\n2\u03c0 hz, zi\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 0\nThe injections U (n) \u2192 U (n+1), A 7\u2192\nand U (1) \u2192 U (n+1), e2\u03c0i\u03b8 \u2192\n7\n0 A\n\u0012 2\u03c0i\u03b8\n\u0013\ne\n0\nyield a pair of commuting symplectic actions with induced moment\n0\n1n\nmaps. A study of invariant functions on Pn (C) shows that the action of the pair\n(U (1), U (n)) satisfies the symplectic Howe condition.\nFixing \u03be0 = 2\u03c0i the moment map \u03a61 reads as \u03a6\u03be0 * \u03be0\u2217 \u2208 u(1)\u2217 and -identifying\nu(1)\u2217 with R via the base consisting of \u03be0\u2217 - one has that \u03a61 (M ) = [\u2212k, 0]. We\nalso find that \u03a62 (M ) = U (n) * S, where S = {y * \u03c611 | 0 \u2264 y \u2264 k} is a global slice,\ni\nwith \u03c611 (X) = 2\u03c0\nX11 for X \u2208 u(n) \u2286 Mat(n\u00d7n; C). The orbit correspondence\n\u039b is then given by x 7\u2192 U (n) * ((x + k)\u03c611 ). Integral points in \u03a61 (M ) are simply\npoints m \u2208 [\u2212k, 0] \u2229 Z with associated representation e2\u03c0i\u03b8 7\u2192 e2\u03c0im\u03b8 , whereas\nin \u03a62 (M ) an orbit U (n) * (y\u03c611 ) with y \u2265 0 is integral if and only if y \u2208 N.\nObviously, integrality of orbits in the sense of Def. 3.5 is preserved by the orbit\ncorrespondence map \u039b.\nFor k > 0, the geometric quantization of (Pn (C), k\u03c9 FS ) is given by the holomorphic sections module of the k-th power of the hyperplane bundle over Pn (C),\nisomorphic as a U (n+1)-representation to Ck [z0 , z1 , . . . , zn ], the space of complex\nhomogeneous polynomials of degree k in n+1 variables.\nAs a (U (1) \u00d7 U (n))-representation this space decomposes as\n\u03a6\u03b6 ([z]) = k\n\nk\nM\n\nCd [z0 ] \u2297 Ck\u2212d [z1 , . . . , zn ],\n\nd=0\n\nwhere for l \u2208 N, Cl [z1 , . . . , zn ] is the space of complex homogeneous polynomials\nof degree l in n variables, the U (n)-representation associated to U (n) * (l\u03c611 ) \u2208\n\u03a62 (M )/U (n), and Cd [z0 ] realizes the U (1)-representation on C given by the character e2\u03c0i\u03b8 7\u2192 e2\u03c0i(\u2212d)\u03b8 associated to \u2212d \u2208 \u03a61 (M ) \u2229 Z.
