It is not clear if it\nis soft, moderate or stiff; if the matter contains nucleons/hyperons, or exotic components. In the absence of\ngood practical theory of supranuclear matter the problem cannot be solved on purely theoretical basis, but it\ncan be solved by comparing theoretical models with observations of neutron stars. The attempts to solve this\nlong-standing problem by different methods are numerous (e.g., Refs. [1, 2]). Here we discuss current results\nobtained from studies of cooling isolated neutron stars.\nThe first papers on neutron star cooling appeared with\nan advent of X-ray astronomy, before the discovery of\nneutron stars. Their authors tried to prove that neutron\nstars cool not too fast and can be discovered as sources\nof thermal surface X-ray radiation. The first estimates of\nthermal emission from cooling neutron stars were most\nprobably done by Stabler [3] in 1960. Four years later\nChiu [4] made similar estimates and analyzed the possibility to discover neutron stars from their thermal emission. First, simplified calculations of neutron star cooling\nwere done in 1964 and 1965 [5, 6, 7]. The foundation of\nthe strict cooling theory was laid in 1966 by Tsuruta and\nCameron [8], one year before the discovery of pulsars.\nWe review the current state of the cooling theory. More\ndetails can be found in recent review papers [9, 10].\n\nCOOLING NEUTRON STARS\nNeutron stars are thought to consist of a thin crust and\na massive core (e.g., Ref. [1]). The crust constitutes a\nTheory of cooling neutron stars versus observations\n\nfew per cent of the star's mass and is about \u223c 1 km\nthick. The mass density \u03c1 at the crust-core boundary is\n\u2248 \u03c10 /2, where \u03c10 \u2248 2.8 \u00d7 1014 g cm\u22123 is the density of\nsaturated nuclear matter. The crust is further divided into\nthe outer and inner crust. The outer crust (more generally,\nthe outer envelope; where \u03c1 is below the neutron drip\n11\n\u22123\ndensity <\n\u223c 4 \u00d7 10 g cm ) consists of atomic nuclei\nand strongly degenerate electrons. In the inner crust, free\nneutrons appear in addition to the electrons and nuclei;\nthese neutrons can be in superfluid state.\nThe neutron star core can be divided into the outer and\ninner core. The outer core extends to \u03c1 \u223c (2 \u2212 3)\u03c10 and\nconsists of neutrons (n), with an admixture of protons\n(p), electrons (e) and possibly muons. All these particles\nare strongly degenerate. The inner core extends to the\nstellar center [to \u223c (10 \u2212 20)\u03c10 in most massive stars].\nIts composition is very uncertain. It may be the same\nas in the outer core or essentially different. In particular,\nhyperons may appear there in addition to nucleons. Another possibility is the appearance of exotic matter (pion\nor kaon condensates or strange quark matter or mixed\nphases, as reviewed, e.g., in [1]). Nucleons, hyperons and\nquarks can be in superfluid state. Physical properties of\nmatter at \u03c1 <\n\u223c \u03c10 are more or less restricted by nuclear\nphysics data, but at higher \u03c1 they are uncertain. Typical baryon chemical potentials \u223c 500 MeV in a neutron\nstar core are most difficult for rigorous microscopic calculations. Note a lively discussion in the literature that\ncompact stars (or some of them) can be not neutron stars\nbut strange stars (e.g., Refs. [1, 2, 11]) built entirely or\nalmost entirely of strange quark matter.\nNeutron stars are born in supernova explosions with\nhigh internal temperature T \u223c 1011 K, but gradually cool\ndown. In \u223c30 s after the birth a star becomes transparent for neutrinos generated in its interiors and transforms from a proto-neutron star (e.g., [12]) to an ordinary\n\nNovember 11, 2018\n\n1\n\n\fTABLE 1.

At the later neutrinotransparent stage the star cools via neutrino emission\nfrom its interior and via heat transport to the surface and\nsubsequent photon thermal emission.\nNeutron star cooling is described by general relativistic equations [13] of heat diffusion inside the star with\nneutrino energy sources and surface photon emission.\nThe solution gives the distribution of the temperature T\ninside the star versus time t, and the effective surface\ntemperature Ts (t). To simplify computations, one divides\n[14] the neutron star into the interior region and the outermost heat-blanketing envelope [extended to densities\n\u03c1 \u2264 \u03c1b \u223c (1010 \u2212 1011) g cm\u22123 ]. The thermal structure\nof the blanketing envelope is studied separately in the\nstationary, plane-parallel approximation, that relates Ts\nto the temperature Tb at \u03c1 = \u03c1b . The diffusion equations\nare then solved in the interior (\u03c1 \u2265 \u03c1b ).\nThe thermal photon luminosity of the star is L\u03b3 =\n4\u03c0\u03c3 R2Ts4 (t), where R is the circumferential stellar radius. Both, L\u03b3 and Ts , refer to a locally-flat reference\nframe on the stellar surface. A distant observer detects\nthe \"apparent\" luminosity L\u03b3\u221e = L\u03b3 (1 \u2212 rg /R) and the\np\n\"apparent\" effective temperature Ts\u221e = Ts 1 \u2212 rg/R,\nwhere rg = 2GM/c2 is the Schwarzschild radius and M is\nthe gravitational neutron star mass. If the surface temperature distribution is anisotropic (for instance, owing to a\nstrong magnetic field), L\u221e\n\u03b3 is determined by a properly\naveraged surface temperature (e.g., Ref. [15]).\nThe theory gives cooling curves, Ts\u221e (t), and predicts\nthree main cooling stages. The initial stage of internal\nthermal relaxation lasts t <\n\u223c 10 \u2212 50 yr. At this stage, the\nneutron star crust stays hotter than the core and thermally\ndecoupled from it (because of much stronger neutrino\ncooling in the core). The surface temperature is then insensitive to the physics of the core but strongly depends\non physical properties of the crust [16, 17]. Since no neutron star has been observed at this stage, we will not discuss it in detail. The next stage of neutrino cooling with\n5\n6\nisothermal interior lasts t <\n\u223c 10 \u2212 10 yr. At this stage the\nneutrino luminosity L\u03bd \u226b L\u03b3 ; thermal conduction is high\nand makes the stellar interior isothermal, with the main\ntemperature gradient located in the heat blanketing envelope. The cooling is mostly regulated by a strong neutrino emission from the core. The surface temperature responds to the core cooling and depends on properties of\nsuperdense core. All cooling isolated neutron stars whose\n\nTheory of cooling neutron stars versus observations\n\n1020 \u2212 3 \u00d7 1021\n1019 \u2212 1020\n\nthermal surface radiation has been detected seem to be at\nthis neutrino cooling stage (or its very end). Therefore,\nwe focus our attention on this stage. At the next photon\ncooling stage the star is cold; its neutrino emission dies\nout (L\u03bd \u226a L\u03b3 ) and the cooling is governed by photon surface emission.\nSoon after the cooling starts (in minutes to a year,\ndepending on the internal structure), the core temperature\ndrops to T \u223c 109 K. For this T , the internal thermal\nenergy of the star is \u223c 1048 erg. The cooling theory\nshows how this heat emerges from the star.\n\nNEUTRINO EMISSION MECHANISMS\nLet us summarize the main neutrino emission mechanisms in the neutron star core. They are strongly affected\nby baryon superfluidity. More details can be found, e.g.,\nin Refs. [18, 19, 20].\nNeutrino emission in nonsuperfluid cores. The major neutrino mechanisms in nucleon matter of the outer\ncore (\u03c1 <\n\u223c 2 \u03c10 ) are modified Urca process and nucleonnucleon bremsstrahlung. They are listed in Table 1 (from\nRef. [9]), where N denotes a nucleon (n or p). They\nare relatively weak and produce slow neutrino cooling.\nThe modified Urca process differs from its direct Urca\nprogenitor, described below, by an additional nucleonspectator that is required to satisfy momentum conservation of reacting particles. All reactions involving electrons can involve muons instead (if available in dense\nmatter).\nAt higher \u03c1 , in the inner core, neutrino emission can\nbe strongly enhanced by new mechanisms (Table 2, from\n[9]). The enhancement level greatly depends on the EOS\nand composition of superdense matter that is most important for the cooling problem. The strongest enhancement is provided by direct Urca process [21, 22] in nucleon (or nucleon-hyperon) matter. It is a sequence of\ntwo reactions (a beta decay and beta capture) forbidden\nin the outer core by momentum conservation. It is allowed in the inner core for the matter with rather high\n(>\n\u223c 11\u201313%) proton fraction (for EOSs with large symmetry energy of nuclear matter). If it is forbidden but the\nmatter contains pion condensate, neutrino emission is enhanced (although weaker) by direct-Urca-type reactions\ne (superpositions of n and p)\ninvolving quasinucleons N\nin pion-condensed matter. If pion condensate is absent,\nNovember 11, 2018\n\n2\n\n\fTABLE 2.

Nearly the same enhancement is expected due to\nthe direct Urca process involving d and u quarks in quark\nmatter. The processes in the inner core (Table 2) can amplify the neutrino emission by 2\u20137 orders of magnitude\nand lead to fast cooling. It is also possible that the neutrino emission in the inner core is not enhanced.\nThe emissivity Q\u03bd (\u03c1 , T ) of slow and fast neutrino\nprocesses in nonsuperfluid matter can be written as\nQslow = Qs T98 ,\n\nQfast = Qf T96 ,\n\n(1)\n\n= T /(109\n\nwhere T9\nK), while Qs and Qf are slowly varying functions of \u03c1 (Tables 1 and 2). Thus, the neutrino\nluminosities of massive and low-mass stars (with and\nwithout inner core) can be very different. For instance,\nin a young massive star, where the direct Urca is open\nand the core temperature is T = 109 K, L\u03bd is as huge\nas \u223c 1046 erg s\u22121 . In a low-mass star at the same T , L\u03bd\nwould be \u223c 7 orders of magnitude lower. In both cases L\u03bd\nrapidly decreases when the star cools. For instance, one\nhas L\u03bd \u223c 1034 erg s\u22121 for a low-mass star at t \u223c 10 kyr.\nNeutrino emission in superfluid cores. Nucleons, hyperons, and quarks in dense matter can be in superfluid\nstate (e.g., [23], also see [9, 19] for references). This superfluidity occurs via Cooper pairing of particles owing\nto an attractive component of their interaction (with the\nappearance of a gap in the particle energy spectrum near\nthe Fermi level). Systematic simulations of cooling superfluid neutron stars were triggered by a remarkable paper of Page and Applegate [24]. Superfluidity of any particles is characterized by its own density dependent critical temperature Tc (\u03c1 ). Microscopic calculations of Tc (\u03c1 )\nare extremely model dependent and give a large scatter\nof critical temperatures. Let us mention several general\nfeatures.\nNeutron pairing in the spin singlet state with zero angular momentum (1 S0 ) occurs in the inner neutron star\ncrust (for free neutrons) and dies out in the core because singlet-state nuclear attraction turns into repulsion\nnear the crust-core interface. Neutron pairing in the core\nmay occur in a triplet state with unit angular momentum, 3 P2 (coupled to a spin triplet state with three units\nTheory of cooling neutron stars versus observations\n\np+e \u2192 n+\u03bd\ne +e \u2192 N\ne +\u03bd\nN\ne +e \u2192 B\ne +\u03bd\nB\nu+e \u2192 d+\u03bd\n\nQf [erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 ]\n1026 \u2212 3 \u00d7 1027\n1023 \u2212 1026\n1023 \u2212 1024\n1023 \u2212 1024\n\nof angular momentum, 3 F2 ). Cooper pairing of other\nparticles in the core can occur either in a singlet state\nor in a triple state. Baryon superfluidity is affected by\nthe presence of pion or kaon condensate (e.g., [25] and\nreferences therein). Calculated values Tc (\u03c1 ) range from\n\u223c 108 K to a few\u00d71010 K and vanish at supranuclear\ndensities (where attractive pairing interaction becomes\ninefficient).\nA special case is presented by color superconductivity\n[26] owing to very strong pairing of unlike quarks in\nquark matter, where Tc (\u03c1 ) can be as high as \u223c 5\u00d71011 K.\nAny baryon superfluidity reduces neutrino processes\ninvolving these baryons (Tables 1 and 2) due to a gap in\nthe baryon energy spectrum. At T \u226a Tc , the reduction\nis exponentially strong. For instance, the powerful direct\nUrca process can be formally open in the inner core,\nbut completely suppressed by a strong superfluidity of\nneutrons of protons.\nIn addition, when T falls below Tc , superfluidity initiates a specific neutrino emission due to Cooper pairing\nof baryons [27] which enhances neutrino cooling. This\nmechanism can enhance the neutrino luminosity of the\nstar by a factor of <\n\u223c 30 \u2212 100 over the modified Urca\nlevel [28, 29].\nSuperfluidity affects also neutron star heat capacity\n[19] and thermal conductivity [30, 31] but these effects\nare less strong.\n\nOBSERVATIONS\nWe will compare cooling theory with observations of surface thermal radiation of isolated neutron stars.

For the sources mentioned\nin [29, 35, 36] the choice of t and Ts\u221e is mainly the\nsame as in these references. The ages of other sources\nare pulsar spindown ages, and the errobars of t and Ts\u221e\nare chosen in the same way as in [29, 35, 36]. We have\nenlarged a possible age range of the source 2 to 5.4 kyr,\nthe pulsar spindown age, because this source can be accidentally projected onto the SNR 3C 58 (Yu.A. Shibanov,\nprivate communication, 2007). The values of Ts\u221e are inferred from observations (reported in the indicated references) assuming either black-body (BB) spectrum or a\nhydroden atmosphere model (magnetic or nonmagnetic\none, mHA or HA). For the sources 13 and 16, Ts\u221e is determined [47, 49] using models of hydrogen atmospheres\nof finite depth (mHA\u2217 and HA\u2217 , respectively). One important source, 1E 1207.4\u20135209, is not included in the\ntable because of the problems to interpret its spectrum\n(although modeling of such spectra is progressing [50]).\n\nBASIC COOLING CURVES\nFor illustration, we will mainly use models of neutron\nstars whose cores contain neutrons, protons and electrons and have a stiff phenomenological EOS proposed\nin Ref.

The vertical dotted\nline shows the direct Urca threshold, \u03c1D . The thick line\n(NoSF) is for nonsuperfluid matter. At \u03c1 < \u03c1D the neutrino emission is determined by the modified Urca process. When \u03c1 increases above \u03c1D , the emissivity jumps\nby 7 orders of magnitude due to the direct Urca onset.\nFig. 2a presents the cooling curve for a 1.3M\u2299 nonsuperfluid star compared with the data.

Very schematic view of (a) neutrino emissivity\nprofile in a neutron star core and (b) neutrino luminosity versus\nstar's mass at a fixed core temperature T . Units are arbitrary.\n\ntypical example of slow cooling via the modified Urca\nprocess. It is actually universal, being almost the same\nfor all stars with 1.1 M\u2299 \u2264 M < MD , and for a wide class\nof EOSs [24]. This universal curve goes through the scatter of observational points but cannot explain the sources\nwhich are hottest and coolest for their age. These sources\nseem to have neutrino luminosities lower and higher than\nthe modified Urca level.\nNow consider a set of nonsuperfluid neutron star models of masses from 1.1 to 1.97 M\u2299 , with the mass step of\n0.01 M\u2299 (Fig. 2b). The first 26 models (M \u2264 1.35 M\u2299 <\nMD ) belong to the class of low-mass stars and show the\nuniversal slow cooling behavior. The next 1.36 M\u2299 star\nhas a small central kernel with the enhanced neutrino\nemission and shows much faster cooling (is much colder\nthan all observed sources). All other more massive stars\ncool even faster via the direct Urca process and belong\nto the family of cold massive rapidly cooling stars. Evidently, these cooling curves cannot explain the data.\n\nTheory of cooling neutron stars versus observations\n\nA majority of realistic cooling scenarios, constructed up\nto now, satisfy the following basic phenomenological\nconcept:\n(1) Low-mass stars undergo slow neutrino cooling.\n(2) Massive stars cool much faster via neutrino emission from their inner cores.\n(3) There is a family of medium-mass stars whose\ncooling is intermediate between the slow and fast ones.\nAccordingly, the density profile of the neutrino emissivity in a neutron star core can look like that plotted in\nFig. 3a; \u03c11 and \u03c12 mark the density range, where the slow\ncooling transforms into the fast one. This Q\u03bd (\u03c1 ) profile\ntranslates into a characteristic dependence of the neutrino\nluminosity L\u03bd on the stellar mass shown in Fig. 3b; the\ntransition between the slow cooling to the fast one takes\nplace in the mass range from M1 to M2 .\nThus, at the present stage of investigation, the cooling\ntheory has potential to test four main parameters of the\nneutrino emissivity function Q\u03bd (\u03c1 ) or the luminosity\nfunction L\u03bd (M). They specify the lower and upper levels\nof neutrino emission (either Qslow and Qfast or Lslow and\nLfast ) and the position of the transition zone between the\nslow and fast emission (either \u03c11 and \u03c12 or M1 and M2 ).\n\nEXAMPLES OF PHYSICAL MODELS\nTwo examples [52] of successful realization of the above\nscheme are given in Figs. 2c and d. The figures show the\ncooling curves for neutron stars of M = (1.1 \u2212 1.97) M\u2299\nwith strong proton superfluidity (1p or 2p) in the core\n(but with normal neutrons). The density profiles Tc (\u03c1 ) of\nthe proton critical temperature are shown in Fig. 1a; they\nare phenomenological and can be regarded as illustraNovember 11, 2018\n\n5\n\n\ftive. In the outer core, proton superfluidity is strong and\nsuppresses the modified Urca process. Accordingly, the\nslow neutrino emission of low-mass stars is determined\nby weaker neutrino bremsstrahlung in neutron-neutron\ncollisions. This rises the surface temperature of low-mass\nstars and allows one to explain observations of hottest\nsources.\nIn addition, proton superfluidity penetrates into the inner core (\u03c1 > \u03c1D ) and suppresses the direct Urca process within the penetration depth. It broadens the direct Urca threshold and realizes a smooth transition from\nslowly to rapidly cooling neutron stars with the growth\nof M. Superfluidity 2p penetrates deeper than 1p which\nwidens the range of masses of medium-mass stars. One\ncan now explain observations of all the sources, including the coldest ones. Moreover, these scenarios predict\nthe existence of very cold massive neutron stars (which\nhave not been observed so far).\nIf the EOS and the critical temperature Tc (\u03c1 ) in the\nstellar core were known, one would be able to \"weigh\"\nneutron stars [52]. For instance, the mass of the Vela pulsar would be 1.47 M\u2299 for superfluidity 1p and 1.61 M\u2299\nfor 2p. Unfortunately, neither EOS nor Tc (\u03c1 ) are known\nand the \"weighing\" procedure is ambiguous. Nevertheless, as a rule, the ambiguity does not destroy the mass\nordering of cooling stars. For instance, the Vela pulsar\nis expected to be more massive than RX J0822\u20134300.\nMoreover, one can invert the scheme and state that had\nthe mass of one or several cooling neutron stars been\nmeasured, one could constrain the EOS and Tc (\u03c1 ).\nOne can construct many other models of cooling neutron stars consistent with the data. One can take other\nEOSs in the core [with other direct Urca thresholds \u03c1D\nand functions Tc (\u03c1 )]. For instance, one can assume the\npresence of strong neutron superfluidity and normal protons (because cooling curves are nearly symmetric [53]\nwith respect to exchanging neutron and proton Tc (\u03c1 ) profiles).\nThe direct Urca threshold can also be broadened by\nnuclear effects (e.g., of pion polarization; see [54] and\nreferences therein) or by superstrong magnetic fields\n15\n>\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 10 G [55] in a nonsuperfluid neutron star core.\n\nLEVELS OF SLOW AND FAST\nNEUTRINO EMISSION\nAfter several examples we can turn to a general analysis.\nOne can show that it is sufficient to lower the neutrino luminosity due to the modified Urca process in a\nlow-mass star by a factor of \u223c 30 \u2212 100 to explain observations of stars hottest for their age. This low neutrino luminosity can be produced by nucleon-nucleon\nbremsstrahlung. The modified Urca process can be reTheory of cooling neutron stars versus observations\n\nduced by nucleon superfluidity, as in the above examples\n(Figs. 2c and d).\nThe level of fast neutrino emission in high-mass stars\nis less certain. To analyze it, let us consider (Fig. 4)\nthree typical levels appropriate to the direct Urca process\nin nucleon/hyperon matter; to pion-condensed matter;\nand kaon-condensed matter. A schematic picture of the\nneutrino emissivity profiles through the stellar core for\nthese scenarios is presented in Fig. 4a.\nFig. 4b shows the ranges of Ts\u221e (hatched regions)\nwhich can be explained by the theory assuming the scenario with the direct Urca process. The upper curve\nshows cooling of low-mass stars via neutron-neutron\nbremsstrahlung neutrino emission (as in Figs. 2c and d).\nThe lower curve presents fast cooling of a maximummass star with direct Urca process open in the inner core.\nAny value of Ts\u221e between these two curves can be explained by a cooling of a star with some intermediate\nmass. As discussed above, this scenario explains all the\ndata and predicts the existence of very cold neutron stars.\nFig. 4c refers to the scenario with pion-condensation.\nThe upper cooling curve is the same as in Fig. 4b (because low-mass stars have no inner cores), but the lower\ncurve goes essentially higher (because the neutrino emission due to pion condensation is lower than due to direct\nUrca process). This scenario also explains all the sources\nand predicts the existence of cold stars, but not so cold as\nin the direct Urca case.\nFig. 4d is a similar plot for the scenario with kaoncondensation in the inner core. High-mass stars cool\nslower than in the previous scenarios, but all the data are\nstill explained and a population of stars slightly colder\nthan the observed ones is predicted.\nThus, all three scenarios are currently consistent with\nthe observations, but predict different families of cold\nstars. Similar conclusions have been made by a number\nof authors (see, e.g., [9, 10] and references therein). Calculations show that the the neutrino luminosity in the inner core should be \u224830\u2013100 times higher than the modified Urca luminosity to explain all the sources and leave\nno space for neutron stars colder than the observed ones.\nA discovery of very cold neutron stars would be crucial\nto firmly constrain the enhanced neutrino emission level.\nUnfortunately, current observations give no reliable\nconstraints on the position of the transition layer between\nslowly and fastly neutrino emitting regions in the core\n(on \u03c11 and \u03c12 or M1 and M2 in Fig. 3).\n\nOTHER ASPECTS\nWe do not discuss in detail many aspects of the cooling\ntheory but mention them here.\nFirst, cooling can also be regulated by heat conduction\nin the neutron star crust.

(b), (c), and (d): Ranges of Ts\u221e (hatched)\nfor the three types of fast emission compared with observations (see text for details).\n\ncrust can be affected by composition of the matter (e.g.,\nby the presence of light elements in accreted surface\nlayers) and magnetic fields (in the outer and inner crust;\nsee, e.g., [9, 10, 56] and references therein). However,\nthese cooling regulators are usually not as strong as\nneutrino emission from the core.\nThe effects of superfluidity can be more sophisticated\nthan described above. Taking different EOSs [different\ndirect Urca thresholds and Tc (\u03c1 ) profiles] one can obtain\na complicated zoo of families of cooling neutron stars\n[35, 57]. Neutrino emission due to Cooper pairing of\nbaryons can affect the cooling in many ways as reviewed\nin Refs. [9, 10]. In particular, a moderately strong neutron superfluidity in the nucleon core can enhance the\nneutrino luminosity over the modified Urca level by a\nfactor of \u223c30, allowing one to explain the coldest observed sources by neutrino emission from the nucleon\n(non-exotic) core without invoking the direct Urca process. This leads to the scenario of \"minimal cooling\"\n[28, 29].\nCooling of neutron stars can be accompanied by some\nreheating associated, for instance, with the dissipation of\ndifferential rotation, deviation from beta-equilibrium or\ndecay of magnetic fields in neutron star interiors. The\nmagnetic reheating can be especially strong in magnetars\n(see below). Otherwise these reheating mechanisms are\nexpected to be significant in old neutron stars (at the\nphoton cooling stage). They are reviewed in [9, 10].\nFinally, we have not discussed cooling of strange stars\nand neutron stars with quark cores. A comprehensive\nreview is given in [10].\n\nCONNECTIONS\nWith the spectacular progress of neutron star observations, cooling problem becomes more connected to other\nTheory of cooling neutron stars versus observations\n\naspects of neutron star physics.\nFirst, cooling of isolated neutron stars is closely related to deep crustal heating of transiently accreting neutron stars in soft X-ray transients (SXTs). The matter accreted on a neutron star becomes eventually compressed\nby the weight of newly accreted material and sinks thus\ninto the crust. Sinking into the deep crust is accompanied\nby nuclear transformations [58, 59, 60, 61] and associated heating of the entire star (1.5 \u2212 2 MeV per one accreted nucleon). This deep crustal heating can keep thermally inertial stars warm [62] even in quiescent states of\nSXTs when accretion is switched off. It is likely responsible for thermal emission observed from some SXTs in\nquiescent states (e.g., Refs. [63, 64]).\nOne can distinguish two heating regimes. As a rule,\naccretion episodes are not too long (weeks-months) and\ndo not violate isothermality of internal layers. These stars\nreach thermal quasiequilibrium determined by the mass\naccretion rates h\u1e40i averaged over their global thermal\nrelaxation time (\u223c 100 \u2212 1000 yr). Observations of these\nobjects test essentially the same physics of neutron star\ninterior as observations of cooling isolated neutron stars\n(e.g., [65, 66, 67]). The analysis of the data on SXTs\n[63, 64, 65] generally agrees with the above analysis\nof cooling neutron stars, but with important exceptions.\nThe upper limits on Ts in quiescent states of the transiently accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4\u20133658\nand possibly the SXT 1H 1905+000 are very low, giving\nan example of very cold neutron stars (missing so far in\nthe data on cooling neutron stars). If true, these neutron\nstars undergo strong neutrino cooling via direct Urca process. However, in view of uncertainties associated with\nthe deep crustal heating hypothesis, determination of Ts\nand h\u1e40i, these results should be taken with caution.\nSome SXTs (KS 1731\u2013260 and MXB 1659\u201329, e.g.,\n[68]) show long accretion episodes (a few years and\nmore) in which the crust may become much warmer than\nNovember 11, 2018\n\n7\n\n\fthe core. After accretion stops, the crust cools and thermally equilibrates with the core. This crust-core relaxation is reflected in the relaxation of the surface temperature Ts (t), that is observed and can give important information on the crust and core physics [68, 69, 70, 71].\nCooling theory is also employed to study thermal\nstates of magnetars. It seems one needs to introduce a\nreheating (most probably produced by strong magnetar magnetic fields) to explain high observed X-ray luminosities of magnetars. One can study quasistationary\nthermal states of magnetars (e..g., [72]) and afterburst relaxation (e.g., [73]).\nIn addition, cooling theory can be used to analyze the\npropagation of thermal waves in neutron stars during Xray bursts and superbursts (e.g., [74, 75]) and to explore\ncooling of vibrating neutron stars [76].\nSince the data are becoming numerous it is possible to\ncombine cooling theory with neutron star statistics [77].\n\n(6) New observations and reliable practical theories\nof dense matter are vitally important to tune the cooling\ntheory as an instrument for exploring physical properties\nof neutron star interiors and neutron star parameters. The\ntuning will imply a careful analysis of many cooling\nregulators.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was partially supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (grants 05-02-16245 and 0502-22003), by FASI-Rosnauka (grant NSh 9879.2006.2),\nand by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (grant\nNSF PHY 0216783).\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe theory of cooling neutron stars of ages 102 \u2212 106\nyr mostly tests the neutrino emission properties of the\nneutron star core. Its main results are as follows.\n(1) Neutrino emission in the outer core (i.e., in the core\nof a low-mass star) is a factor of 30\u2013100 lower than the\nmodified Urca emission in a nonsuperfluid star.\n(2) Neutrino emission in the inner core (of a massive\nstar) is at least a factor of 30\u2013100 higher than the modified Urca emission. It can be enhanced by direct Urca\nprocess in nucleon/hyperon inner core or by the presence\nof pion or kaon condensate, or quark matter.\n(3) The scenario with open direct Urca process predicts the existence (Fig. 4) of massive isolated neutron\nstars which are much colder than those observed now.\nIn the scenario with pion condensate, the massive stars\nshould be warmer (than those with open direct Urca) but\ncolder than the observed ones. In the scenario with kaon\ncondensate the massive stars should be even warmer but\nslightly colder than the observed sources. A discovery of\ncold cooling neutron stars would be crucial to constrain\nthe level of enhanced neutrino emission in the inner core.\n(4) Observations of cooling neutron stars can be analyzed together with observations of SXTs in quiescent\nstates. The data on SXTs indicate the existence of very\ncold neutron stars (first of all, SAX J1808.4\u20133658) which\ncool via direct Urca process, but the data and interpretation require additional confirmation.\n(5) A transition from slow neutrino emission in the\nouter core to enhanced emission in the inner core has\nto be smooth. Current observations of cooling neutron\nstars and SXTs do not constrain the parameters of this\ntransition. A firm measurement of masses of cooling or\naccreting stars would help to impose such constraints.\nTheory of cooling neutron stars versus observations\n\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\n21.\n22.\n\nP.
