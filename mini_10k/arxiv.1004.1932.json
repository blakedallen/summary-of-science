Standard techniques typically involve severe approximations\nsuch as, for example, factorization of correlation functions, truncation of hierarchies, closure conditions, etc.\nUnderstanding the details of such approximations is crucial for identifying the range of applicability of the resulting field equations. If a complex fluid is made up\nof active constituents (e.g., bacteria or other microorganisms) that propel themselves by quasi-periodic\nswimming mechanisms [2, 3], then one usually faces\nthe additional task of approximating the explicitly timedependent microscopic dynamics with a set of coarsegrained, time-averaged equations of motion. Aiming at a\nbetter quantitative understanding of this commonly employed approximation, the present paper provides a detailed comparison between the microscopic dynamics of\nactively driven, spring-based dumbbells and those of a\ntime-averaged analytic model derived from far-field expansion [4, 5].\nOwing to the fact that hydrodynamic interactions are\nlong-range, simulations of the full time-resolved dynamics of S = N/2 dumbbells (each consisting of two spheres)\nare numerically expensive, scaling as N 2 . However, in the\ndeterministic limit case and/or additive noise limit [6],\nthe dynamics is well suited to parallel computations.\nVery recently, GPU-based codes have been used for various statistical mechanics problems, yielding speed-ups\non the order of 20-100 times a CPU-only solution [7\u201310].\nHere, we implement a straightforward N 2 solution of the\nhydrodynamic equations of motion, a communicationsintensive task which is difficult to parallelize in tradi-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: v.putz1@physics.ox.ac.uk\naddress: jorn.dunkel@physics.ox.ac.uk\n\u2021 Electronic address: j.yeomans1@physics.ox.ac.uk\n\u2020 Electronic\n\ntional clusters. For a moderate population size (up to a\nfew thousand particles), this method decreases the computation time by a factor of 100 compared with conventional CPU simulations on standard consumer hardware.\nHence, we identify GPU computing as a promising approach for future simulations of active particle suspensions (details of the numerical implementation are summarized in Sec. V).\nPassive (non-driven) dumbbell models have been\nwidely investigated in polymer science and related fields\nover the past decades (see, e.g., Refs. [11\u201317]). Very recently, several authors [4, 5, 18] considered active, internally driven dumbbells as prototype systems for collective swimming at zero Reynolds number, R = 0. Loosely\nspeaking, one can say that active dumbbell systems constitute a sort of 'Ising model' of collective swimming, i.e.,\nthey represent strongly simplified models which can be\ntreated by analytical means, thus providing useful insights. Active dumbbells are particularly well-suited to\nidentifying the role of hydrodynamic long-range interactions in collective micro-swimming. This is because isolated deterministic dumbbells are prevented from selfmotility by Purcell's scallop theorem [2]. Hence, any\neffective motion in deterministic dumbbell systems is\ncaused by hydrodynamic interactions between different\ndumbbells.\nIn a recent paper, Alexander and Yeomans [5] have derived analytical expressions for the effective far-field interactions of symmetric, active dumbbells in three dimensions (3d). Specifically, they showed that the effective\nhydrodynamic pair interaction decays with distance |D|\nas |D|\u22124 . Considering 1d motions, Lauga and Bartolo [4]\nextended this result to asymmetric dumbbells and found\nthat in this case the hydrodynamic interaction decays\nless strongly as |D|\u22123 . While these studies have led to\nnovel insights into interplay between swimmer symmetry\nand effective long-distance interaction scaling, a detailed\ncomparison of microscopic and stroke-averaged models is\nstill lacking. The present paper intends to close this gap\nwith respect to symmetric dumbbells.\nFor this purpose, we shall first introduce a microscopic\n\n\f2\nspring-based dumbbell model (Sec. II) that can be readily\nimplemented in GPU-based computer simulations. In the\nlimit of an infinitely stiff spring, our model reduces to a\nshape-driven dumbbell model as considered in Refs. [4, 5].\nThe corresponding 3d stroke-averaged equations of motion will be discussed in Sec. III. After having confirmed\nthat the stroke-averaged model reproduces the main features of the microscopic model simulations in 1d, we perform similar comparative studies for 3d arrays of symmetric dumbbells. Generally, we find that the strokeaveraged dynamics yields relatively accurate description\nof the microscopic model down to distances of only a\nfew times the dumbbells' length. This is remarkable in\nview of the fact that the stroke-averaged model is based\non a far-field expansion. Thus, at least for the model\nconsidered here, our results suggest that stroke-averaged\nfar-field interaction models may indeed provide a useful\nstarting point for the derivation of hydrodynamic field\nequations.\nII.\n\nThe hydrodynamic interaction tensor H couples the deterministic force components F(\u03b2i) that act on the individual spheres. Generally, the vector F = {F(\u03b2i) } comprises contributions from internal forces, e.g., those required to bind and oscillate spheres in an active dumbbell, as well as from external force fields (gravity, etc.).\nThe amplitude of the noise force is determined by the\nfluctuation dissipation theorem, which is satisfied if C is\nconstructed from H by Cholesky decomposition, i.e.,\nX\n2H(\u03b1i)(\u03b2j) =\nC(\u03b1i)(\u03b3k) C(\u03b2j)(\u03b3k) .\n(2)\n\u03b3\n\nIn our numerical simulations, H is given by the RotnePrager-Yamakawa-Mazur tensor [26\u201330]\n\nH(\u03b1i)(\u03b2j)\n\nMICROSCOPIC MODELING OF ACTIVE\nDUMBBELLS\n\nWe shall begin by summarizing the \"microscopic\"\nmodel equations of the spring-based dumbbells simulated\nin our computer experiments. The corresponding strokeaveraged equations of motion will be discussed in Sec. III.\nTo keep the discussion in this part as general as possible\n\u2013 and as reference for future work \u2013 we shall formulate\nthe model for \"Brownian\" dumbbells, even though the\ndiscussion in the subsequent sections will be restricted to\nthe deterministic limit.\nWe consider a system of S identical dumbbells. Each\ndumbbell consists of two spheres, of radius a. At very\nlow Reynolds numbers, inertia is negligible and the state\nof the system at time t is completely described by the\nspheres' position coordinates {X \u03b1 } = {X(\u03b1i) (t)} with\n\u03b1 = 1, . . . , 2S labeling the spheres, and i = 1, 2, 3 the\nspace dimension (throughout, we adopt the Einstein summation convention for repeated lower Latin indices). Neglecting rotations of the spheres, the dynamics is governed by the Ito-Langevin equations [15, 19\u201323]\nX\n\u1e8a(\u03b1i) (t) =\nH(\u03b1i)(\u03b2j) F(\u03b2j) +\n\u03b2\n\nX\n\n(kB T)\n\n1/2\n\nC(\u03b1i)(\u03b2k) \u03be(\u03b2k) (t),\n\n(1a)\n\n\u03b2\n\nwhere kB denotes the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature of the surrounding fluid (\u1e8a := dX/dt). Equation (1a) corresponds to the overdamped limit of Stokesian dynamics [24]. The Gaussian white noise \u03be(\u03b3k) (t)\nmodels stochastic interactions with the surrounding liquid molecules and is characterized by [25]\nh\u03be(\u03b1i) (t)i = 0,\n0\n\n(1b)\n0\n\nh\u03be(\u03b1i) (t)\u03be(\u03b2j) (t )i = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4ij \u03b4(t \u2212 t ).\n\n(1c)\n\n\u03b4ij\n\u03b4ij\n=\n\u03b3\u03b1\n6\u03c0\u03bca\u03b1\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nr\u03b1\u03b2i r\u03b1\u03b2j\n=\n+\n\u03b4ij +\n2\n8\u03c0\u03bc r\u03b1\u03b2\nr\u03b1\u03b2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nr\u03b1\u03b2i r\u03b1\u03b2j\n2a2\n\u03b4ij \u2212 3\n,\n3\n2\n24\u03c0\u03bc r\u03b1\u03b2\nr\u03b1\u03b2\n\nH(\u03b1i)(\u03b1j) =\n\n(3a)\n\n(3b)\n\nwhere r\u03b1\u03b2i := x\u03b1i \u2212 x\u03b2i , \u03b1 6= \u03b2, and r\u03b1\u03b2 := |x\u03b1 \u2212 x\u03b2 |.\nAnalytical formulas presented below are based on an\nOseen approximation, which neglects the second line in\nEq. (3b). The diagonal components (3a) describe Stokesian friction in a fluid of viscosity \u03bc. The off-diagonal\ncomponents (3b) model hydrodynamic interactions between different spheres. Note that H is positive definite for r\u03b1\u03b2 > 2a and divergence-free, \u2202(\u03b2j) H(\u03b1i)(\u03b2j) \u2261 0\nwith \u2202(\u03b2i) := \u2202/\u2202x(\u03b2i) , implying that the Choleskydecomposition (2) is well-defined.\nTo completely specify the model, we still need to fix\nthe intra-dumbbell force. To this end, consider the dumbbell \u03c3, formed by spheres \u03b1 = 2\u03c3 \u2212 1 and \u03b2 = 2\u03c3, and\ndenote its length by d\u03c3 (t) := |X \u03b2 (t) \u2212 X \u03b1 (t)|. Neglecting external force fields from now on, we shall assume\nthat the two spheres are connected by a harmonic spring\nof variable length L\u03c3 (t), i.e., F(\u03b2i) = \u2212\u2202(\u03b2i) U where\nU=\n\nX\n\u03c3\n\nU \u03c3,\n\nU \u03c3 (t, d\u03c3 ) =\n\nk0 \u03c3\n[d \u2212 L\u03c3 (t)]2 ,\n2\n(4)\n\nwith L\u03c3 (t) = ` + \u03bb sin(\u03c9t + \u03c6\u03c3 ) denoting the timedependent equilibrium length of the spring, and ` the\nmean length such that ` > 2a + \u03bb. The dumbbell swimmer is called passive if the stroke amplitude \u03bb = 0, and\nactive if |\u03bb| > 0. As discussed below, the phase parameter \u03c6\u03c3 is important for the interaction between two or\nmore dumbbells.\nFor the overdamped description (1) to remain valid,\nthe driving must be sufficiently slow. More precisely, we\nhave to impose that T\u03b3 \u001c T0 \u001cp\nT , where T := 2\u03c0/\u03c9\nis the driving period, T0 := 2\u03c0/ k0 /M the oscillator\nperiod for a sphere of mass M , and T\u03b3 := M/\u03b3 the characteristic damping time. This restriction ensures that\n\n\f3\nthe dumbbells behave similar to shape-driven swimmers,\ni.e., d\u03c3 ' L\u03c3 (t) is a useful approximation in analytical\ncalculations.\nWith the above assumptions, the N -particle PDF\nf (t, {x(\u03b1i) }) of the stochastic process {X(\u03b1i) (t)} from\nEq. (1) is governed by the Kirkwood-Smoluchowski equation\nX\n\b\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202t f =\n\u2202(\u03b1i) H(\u03b1i)(\u03b2j) \u2202(\u03b2j) U f + kB T\u2202(\u03b2j) f . (5)\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nFor time-independent potentials, the stationary solution\nof this equation is given by the Boltzmann distribution, f \u221d e\u2212U/(kB T) . However, in the remainder, we\nshall focus on the deterministic limit case, formally obtained by putting T = 0 in Eqs. (1a), which is justified\nfor sufficiently big spheres.\n\nIII.\n\nSTROKE-AVERAGED HYDRODYNAMIC\nPAIR INTERACTIONS\n\nIn this part we will summarize the stroke-averaged\nequations of motion for the case of 3d symmetric, deterministic dumbbell swimmers (a detailed derivation,\nwhich differs slightly from that in Ref.

(ii) The effective rotational interactions\nscale as \u221d |D \u03c3\u03c1 |\u22125 . (iii) The stroke-averaged interaction\nterms J, K vanish if the phases \u03c6\u03c3 and \u03c6\u03c1 differ by multiples of \u03c0 [5]. This illustrates the importance of phase\n(de)tuning in the collective swimming at zero Reynolds\nnumber.\n\nIV.\n\nMICROSCOPIC VS. STROKE-AVERAGED\nDYNAMICS\n\nWe next compare the predictions of the strokeaveraged equations (9) with numerical results obtained\nfrom CUDA simulations of the microscopic spring-based\ndumbbell model from Sec. II. For this purpose, we first\nconsider 1d aligned dumbbell pairs similar to those studied by Lauga and Bartolo [4]. The rotational interaction\nof two dumbbells will be analyzed in Sec. IV B. Finally,\nwe also study the collective motion of 3d grids of dumbbells (Sec. IV C). In all cases, the swimmers are assumed\nto be in an infinite body of fluid initially at rest, i.e., no\nadditional boundary conditions (periodic or otherwise)\nare imposed.\n\nA.\n\nThe quantity R21 (t) characterizes the net motion of the\ndumbbell pair, whereas \u2206R21 (t) indicates whether the\ndumbbells the move towards or away from each other.\nAs is evident from Fig. 1 (a), symmetric dumbbells\nmove in the same direction with identical speeds; the\ndirection of the motion is determined by the phase difference \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c61 . As predicted by Eq. (10), the collective displacement over a swimming stroke varies as\n|D\u03c3\u03c1 |\u22124 with the distance between the dumbbells, see\nFigure 1 (b). Even though the stroke-averaged equations (10) are based on a far-field expansion, they describe the microscopic dynamics of aligned dumbbells\nwell down to distances of a few body lengths.\nIn this context, it is worthwhile to note that the quantitative difference between the stroke-averaged dynamics\n(solid lines) and the microscopic simulations (symbols)\nin Figs. 1 (a) and (b), is due to the relatively large parameter ratio a/` = 0.2 used in these simulations. As\nshown explicitly in the Appendix, the stroke averaged\nequations of motion (10) become more accurate in the\nlimit a/` \u2192 0. This is confirmed by the numerical results shown in Fig. 1 (c). This diagram depicts the ratio of the average collective swimming speeds (i.e., the\ncollective displacements after a stroke period) obtained\nby either method for different values of a/` at constant\nstroke-amplitude \u03bb. We readily observe that this ratio\napproaches unity in the limit a/` \u2192 0. However, in view\nof the fact that the collective swimming speed is approximately proportional to the sphere radius a, see Eq. (10),\nwe opted for a moderate value a/` = 0.2 in all our simulations in order to observe noticeable swimming effects.\n\nAligned dumbbell pairs\n\nAs long as thermal fluctuations are negligible, aligned\ndumbbells do not change their orientation and Eq. (9a)\nreduces to (see A 1 for an explicit derivation)\n\u0012 \u00132 \u0012\n\u00134\nX\n\u03bb\n`\n9\nD\u0302\u03c3\u03c1 ,\na\u03c9\nsin(\u03c6\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c6\u03c1 )\n\u1e58\u03c3 =\n16\n`\n|D\u03c3\u03c1 |\n\u03c16=\u03c3\n\n(10)\nwhere \u1e58\u03c3 denotes the coordinates along the common\naxis. The lines in Figs. 1 (a) and (b) represent the dynamics of aligned dumbbell pairs (S = 2) as predicted\nby Eq. (10). Symbols were obtained from microscopic\nsimulations of the corresponding spring-based model described in Sec. II. Following Lauga and Bartolo [4], we\nquantify collective motion of the dumbbell pairs in terms\nof their mean collective displacement (solid lines/filled\nsymbols in Fig. 1),\nR21 (t) =\n\n1 2\n[R (t) + R1 (t)],\n2\n\n(11a)\n\nand their mean relative distance (dashed lines/unfilled\nsymbols in Fig. 1),\n\u2206R21 (t) = R2 (t) \u2212 R1 (t).\n\n(11b)\n\nB.\n\nTwo-dimensional rotation of dumbbell pairs\n\nDumbbells that are arranged in an aligned 1d configuration do not change their orientation. This is different for non-aligned configurations in higher dimensions\nwhere hydrodynamic pair interactions can induce rotations. To test the accuracy of the stroke-averaged equation (9b) for the rotational motions in two dimensions,\nwe conducted a series of simulations using the following\nsetup: The first dumbbell (labelled by \u03c3) was placed at\nthe origin oriented along the x-axis, and a second dumbbell (\u03c1) was placed such that the geometric centres were\nseparated by a distance of 5`. By varying the starting position of the second dumbbell along a circle, while keeping\nthe initial projection constant, we can compare numeric\nand analytic results for various projections s(t), r(t), q(t),\nas defined in Eq. (9d).\nFigure 2 depicts the change of the dumbbells' relative\norientation\n\u2206q(t) := q(t) \u2212 q(0) ,\n\nq(t) := Nj\u03c3 (t)Nj\u03c1 (t)\n\n(12)\n\nafter five swimming strokes t = 5T for two different initial projections (a) q(0) = 0 and (b) q(0) = 1.

Lines\nwere obtained by numerical integration of the stroke-averaged equation (10), whereas symbols show the simulation results for\nthe microscopic spring-based dumbbell model described in Sec. II. Solid lines and filled symbols depict the mean displacement\nR21 (t) \u2212 R21 (0) = {[R2 (t) + R1 (t)] \u2212 [R2 (0) + R1 (0)]}/2 of the geometric centres. Dashed lines and unfilled symbols indicate\nthe relative separation \u2206R21 (t) \u2212 \u2206R21 (0) = [R2 (t) \u2212 R1 (t)] \u2212 [R2 (0) \u2212 R1 (0)]. (a) Symmetric dumbbells do not change their\nrelative separation and move linearly in time depending on the phase difference \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c61 . Simulation parameters are\ncomparable to those of Lauga and Bartolo [4]: Initial separation \u2206R21 (0) = R2 (0) \u2212 R1 (0) = 10`, mean dumbbell length\n` = 5\u03bcm, driving frequency \u03c9 = 500s\u22121 (time on the x-axis is given in units of the stroke period T = 2\u03c0/\u03c9), stroke amplitude\n\u03bb = 0.1`, a = 0.2`, phase difference \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c61 = \u03c0/2. For the microscopic model: spring constants k0 = 0.001kg/s2 , viscosity\n\u03bc = 10\u22123 kg/(ms), particle mass density % = 103 kg/m3 , simulation time step \u2206t \u2248 10\u22124 T . (b) Distance dependance of the\ncollective motion and separation for aligned dumbbell pairs during a stroke period T . Line styles and symbols correspond\nto the same configurations and simulation parameters as used in (a). Remarkably, the stroke-averaged far-field equation (10)\ndescribes the microscopic dumbbell dynamics well down to distances of a few body lengths; however, the deviations from the\ntime-resolved microscopic dynamics accumulate over time, as is evident from (a). The difference between the stroke-averaged\ndynamics (solid lines) and the microscopic simulations (symbols) in (a) and (b) is due to the choice of a relatively large\nparameter ratio a/` = 0.2 in these simulations; the results of both methods agree in the limit a/` \u2192 0 as illustrated in diagram\n(c), which shows the ratio of mean swimmer displacements obtained from the microscopic ('Mic') and stroke-averaged ('SA')\ndynamics at constant \u03bb = 0.1` and various choices of a/`.\n.\n\nscription (9b) correctly reproduces the rotational dynamics of the microscopic spring-based model.\nWe may thus briefly summarize: The results in Figs. 1\nand 2 show that the stroke-averaged equations (9) satisfactorily capture the main features of effective pair\ninteractions in the spring-based microscopic model at\nmoderate-to-low densities (large distances). This corroborates that equations of the type (9) can provide a\nconvenient mesoscopic description which, for example,\ncan be used as a starting point for derivation of coarsegrained macroscopic field theories [31]. Conversely, the\ngood agreement between the averaged dynamics (9) and\nthe microscopic model simulation provides a helpful confirmation that our CUDA algorithm works correctly even\nat relatively low densities, when hydrodynamic interactions effects are relatively weak and algorithms may become prone to numerical instabilities.\nIn the remainder, we shall focus on 3d many-swimmer\nsimulations that fully exploit the virtues of the CUDA\nparallelization scheme.\nC.\n\nCollective swimming of three-dimensional\ndumbbell arrays\n\nIn this section we will compare the predictions of the\nstroke-averaged far-field equations (9) with simulations of\nspring-based dumbbells for 3d dumbbell configurations.\n\nIn our simulation the dumbbells' geometric centers\nR\u03c3 (0) are initially placed on a cubic (x \u00d7 x \u00d7 x)-lattice\nwith equidistant spacing \u03c1\u22121/3 , where \u03c1 is the number\ndensity of the configuration. Initial orientations N \u03c3 (0)\nare sampled uniformly from the unit sphere. For the lattice size we consider values x = 3, 5, 7, 9 corresponding to\na total dumbbell number S = 33 , 53 , 73 , 93 , respectively.\nTo characterize the collective motion, we measure in our\nsimulations the mean square displacement per particle\naveraged over different initial conditions, i.e.,\nW\nS\n1 X 1 X \u03c3\n2\nhhR(t) ii :=\n[R (t; w) \u2212 R\u03c3 (0; w)]\nW w=1 S \u03c3=1\n2\n\n(13)\nwhere the variable w = 1, . . . , W labels different initial\nconditions. We distinguish two classes of initial conditions:\n(i) An \"optimized\" phase distribution: Phases were\nset such that each dumbbell had a phase of 0 or\n\u03c0/2 with all nearest neighbors having the alternate\nphase in the manner of a 3d \"checkerboard\".

One readily observes the\ngood agreement between the microscopic simulations and the\nanalytics.\n\n(ii) A randomized phase distribution: Phases were set\nto random values evenly distributed on the interval\n[0, 2\u03c0), with a different distribution for each run.\nThe corresponding results are indicated by unfilled\nsymbols and dashed lines in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively.\nFig. 3 illustrates how the mean square displacement\nover a period, hhR(T )2 ii, varies with density \u03c1 \u2013 or equivalently with grid spacing \u2013 for an array of (5\u00d75\u00d75) = 125\ndumbbells. As evident from the diagram, the prediction from the stroke-averaged model (9) is in good agreement with the scaling behavior measured for the microscopic model. Furthermore, by comparing filled with unfilled symbols and solid with dashed lines, we note that\nthe collective displacement hhR(T )2 ii is generally smaller\nfor the randomized phase distribution, corroborating the\nfact that optimizing the phase distributions can considerably enhance the effectiveness of collective motions [32].\nFigure 4 shows how the quantity hhR(T )2 ii scales with\nthe total number S of the dumbbells at fixed density \u03c1.\nAfter a slight initial jump from the (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3) case,\nadding more swimmers at fixed density \u03c1 produces only a\n\n10\u22125\n\nFIG. 3: (a) Scaling of the mean square displacement per particle (measured over a period) with number density for two\ndifferent phase distributions.

On\nthis scale, statistical error bars (not shown) are smaller than\nthe size of the symbols. The shift between lines and symbols,\ncaused by the relatively large parameter ratio a/` = 0.2 used\nin these simulations, is consistent with the value expected\nfrom Fig. 1 (c).\n\nminimal increase in displacement, and the effect appears\nfor both optimized or randomized phase distributions.\nAgain, collective displacement is generally smaller for\nrandomized phase distributions than for optimal phase\ndistributions.\n\n\fhhR(T )2 ii/`2\n\n7\n\n10\u221212\n\n10\u221213 1\n10\n\n102\nS\n\n103\n\nFIG. 4: Scaling of the mean square displacement per particle over a period with dumbbell number S at constant density. The diagram depicts the simulation results for collections of dumbbells arranged on a cubic (x \u00d7 x \u00d7 x)-lattice\nwith x = 3, 5, 7, 9 and spacing 10`, averaged over W = 10\ndifferent random initial orientations. Symbols refer to the\nspring-based model and lines to the far-field stroke-averaged\nmodel (9), beginning from the same initial conditions. Increasing the number of swimmers while keeping the number\ndensity constant produces only minimal gains in translational\nspeed. The collective mean square displacement is smallest\nfor (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3) = 27 swimmers, which is due to the relatively large number of swimmers with an incomplete set of\n\"nearest neighbors\" in this case. We also observe that for\nan \"optimized\" phase distribution (filled symbols/solid lines)\nthe effective mean square displacement is larger than for a\nuniformly random phase distribution (empty symbols/dashed\nlines). Again, the shift between lines and symbols, caused\nby the relatively large parameter ratio a/` = 0.2 used in\nthese simulations, is consistent with the value expected from\nFig. 1 (c).\n\nV.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS\n\nThe numerical results were obtained from parallelized\nsimulations run on graphics processing units (GPUs)\nusing Nvidia's Compute Unified Device Architecture\n(CUDA). Compared to conventional CPU programs,\nGPU algorithms may yield significant speed ups (up\nto factors of a few hundreds) whenever a problem can\nbe naturally parallelized [7\u201310], on relatively low-cost\nconsumer-grade hardware. In cases where the problem is\nsmall enough to fit on a single device, the resulting software is simpler, easier to test, less costly to implement,\nand much faster than traditional cluster-based methods.\nThis is the case for deterministic many-swimmer simulations, for stochastic single-swimmer simulations, and also\nfor stochastic many-swimmer simulations with purely additive noise, corresponding to a constant matrix C in\nEq. (1).\nMost O(N 2 ) problems such as N -body simulations\nwith pair interactions involve enough data communication that they are difficult to distribute efficiently, or\n\nare costly enough that they must be recast in more numerically tractable forms such as Ewald summation [33\u2013\n35]. For cases of a few hundred swimmers, CUDAbased implementations of straightforward O(N 2 ) problems present an excellent method for numerical simulation. We use a simple direct computation of spheresphere interactions via the Rotne-Prager-YamakawaMazur tensor, disregarding lubrication forces and closerange interactions due to the dilute nature of the suspensions and slender structure of the dumbbells.\nWe tested our GPU code on an AMD Phenom X4\n940 system running Fedora Linux, using a consumer-level\nNvidia GTX 295 GPU and a more research-oriented Tesla\nC1060 GPU; other tests took place on an Intel i7 860 running Gentoo Linux and a consumer-level GTX 276 GPU.\nAll hardware was capable of double-precision calculation\nand used version 2.3 of the CUDA toolkit.\nInitial testing of a similar but simpler problem (colloids\nmoving under constant applied force, using Oseen interactions and single precision) showed very large benchmarked speed-ups compared with a C-based CPU simulation. For example, with \u223c 2000 particles, we measured\nup to a \u223c 450\u00d7 speed-up when calculating the full hydrodynamic interaction tensor and \u223c 800\u00d7 speed-up using an un-optimized version of the elegant tiled method\ndescribed in [36]. We did not benchmark the current\nsimulation, but estimate the speed-up, while still being\nsignificant, to be considerably less due to the complexity\nof the multi-swimmer problem, additional data transfers\nfrom the GPU, and the use of double precision.\nDespite the speed advantage of the tiled method, we\ndecided to compute the full hydrodynamic interaction\ntensor in our simulations, primarily to maintain congruence with existing C code in a battery of automated unit\ntests and to keep the code as simple as possible. Future\nimplementations will likely reintroduce the tiled calculation to further improve computational efficiency. Generally, it is encouraging that even a relatively straightforward CUDA simulation of the multi-swimmer problem\nexhibits compelling speed advantages over a CPU-based\nsolution.\nThe use of double precision is unfortunate in that single\nprecision calculations on CUDA processors show significant performance increases due to better hardware support and memory performance. However, in the case of\ncollective dumbbell motion, the distance moved in each\ntime-step is very small compared to the length of the\ndumbbells or their position, which caused initial calculations using single precision to fail, as the position incremental during a single timestep fell below the threshold of\nmachine precision. To allow for standardized testing, we\nelected to use double precision and to accept decreased\nperformance rather than implementing a better accumulation algorithm (such as Kahan summation) based on\nsingle precision. For reasons of accuracy, we also chose\nnot to enable Nvidia's fast-math optimizations. The latter can significantly accelerate the computation of certain\nnumeric functions (particularly trigonometric functions)\n\n\f8\nbut this gain comes at the cost of some precision. However, this might represent another opportunity for performance optimization in the future.\nAnother important issue is the choice of the integrator due to accumulation of errors and the stiffness of the\nproblem. A variety of methods were tested, including\nEuler, Adams-Bashforth-Moulton, and Runge-Kutta integrators. The approach eventually used was a one-step\nHeun predictor-corrector method, which produced excellent results and can easily incorporate additive noise\nfor stochastic simulations. The time step for the simulations was chosen based on the smallest dynamical\ntime scale p\nin the problem (given by the spring frequency\nT0 = 2\u03c0/ k0 /M , see discussion in Sec. II) and then\nmanually reduced until numerical errors were acceptable\nby ensuring that single dumbbells did not translate and\nnumeric fluctuations were orders of magnitude below the\nexpected motion caused due to hydrodynamic interactions.\nThe use of a spring-based model created an additional complication: After prescribing the initial position, orientation, and phase of the dumbbell we initially\nplaced the spheres centred at the potential minima. However, numerical integration and finite potential strengths\ncaused the sphere positions to lag very slightly behind the\npotentials once they began moving periodically. Since\nthe hydrodynamically induced dumbbell motion is of a\nvery small scale compared to the dumbbell size, this initial settling caused a large anomalous motion during the\nfirst period of simulation. To rectify this, it was necessary to discard the first period and begin measurements\nafter the lag was established and dumbbell translation\nwas approximately linear. This did cause miniscule deviations of the dumbbells' mean length `, amplitude \u03bb,\nand phase \u03c6 from the values specified by the initial conditions, but tuning the potential spring constant to be\nsufficiently stiff reduced these deviations to acceptable\nvalues of a few percent.\nWhile the results shown here are purely deterministic,\nincorporating noise is relatively straightforward, as the\nsystem hydrodynamic tensor H may be numerically decomposed via Cholesky decomposition [37, 38]. However,\neven with GPU acceleration this decomposition is prohibitively expensive; in the case of slender dumbbells and\ndilute suspensions, we advocate a simple additive noise\nwith a constant matrix C as a reasonable approximation\nin the dilute limit as the off-diagonal terms in Eq. (3) are\nnegligible. We compared the full Cholesky decomposition and an additive-noise approximation in various test\nruns and found that the results for the collective mean\nsquare displacement differed by only a few percent.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have examined the stroke-averaged, far-field equations of motion for symmetric dumbbells, and verified the general properties of this coarse-grained model\n\nby comparing with microscopic numerical simulations\nat relatively low densities. Remarkably, the microscopic and coarse-grained simulations agree well even at\nintermediate-to-high swimmer densities, where the effective equations of motion are expected to become less accurate. However, it should be kept in mind that at very\nhigh densities, when collisions (i.e., steric effects) become\nrelevant, lubrication effects as well as near-field hydrodynamics must be modelled more carefully.\nIn the case of dumbbells arranged on a 3d grid, the\ntranslational speed due to hydrodynamic interaction between dumbbells varies predictably with spacing, tending toward |D|\u22124 decay, where |D| is the distance between dumbbell centres. Due the short range of the effective hydrodynamic interactions for symmetric dumbbells, adding more swimmers at a fixed density has only a\nminimal impact on dumbbell translational speed. On the\nother hand, the collective swimming speed can be noticeably increased by replacing a randomized phase distribution with an ordered, \"optimal\" distribution of phases\nsuch that the difference in phase between a periodicallydriven dumbbell and its nearest neighbors is \u03c0/2.\nGenerally, our numerical investigations illustrate that\nGPU-based simulations of multi-swimmer systems can\nprovide a valuable tool for studying collective motions at\nvery low Reynolds number. Moreover, the CUDA algorithm used in our computer experiments can be readily\nadapted to simulate hydrodynamic interactions between\ncolloids that can be trapped and manipulated by means\nof optical tweezers [39]. Such theoretical investigations\ncan help to create more efficient micropumps, e.g., by optimizing the phase relations in oscillating arrays of colloids.\nFinally, another long-term objective is to compare\nmany-swimmer simulations with predictions of effective\nfield theories [40]. Our above results suggest that the\nmost promising approach towards achieving this goal\nmay be a two-step procedure: (Step 1) One should try to\nderive stroke-averaged equations of motion that correctly\ncapture the phase dependence on the level of effective\ntwo-particle interactions. As our above discussion has\nshown, such coarse-grained models can correctly reproduce many of the main features of the microscopic model.\nThus, it is sufficient for many purposes to implement the\ncoarse-grained equations into a CUDA environment (step\n2). Compared to simulations of the full microscopic dynamics, this may reduce the effective simulation time by\nan additional factor of 100 or more since the analytic\nstroke-averaging procedure makes it unnecessary to numerically resolve the smallest dynamical time scales in\nthe system. We hope that our analysis may provide useful guidance for future efforts in this direction.\nAcknowledgements.\u2013 J.
