Introduction\nQuantum annealing (QA) [1, 2] is the quantum-mechanical version of the simulated\nannealing (SA) algorithm [3] to study optimization problems. While the latter uses\nthe slow annealing of (classical) thermal fluctuations to obtain the ground state of a\ntarget Hamiltonian (cost function), the former uses quantum fluctuations. An extensive\nbody of numerical [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] as well as analytical [10] studies show that QA is\ngenerally more efficient than SA for the ground-state search (optimization) of classical\nHamiltonians of the Ising type. This fact does not immediately imply, however, that SA\nwill soon be replaced by QA in practical applications because the full implementation\nof QA needs an efficient method for solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for large systems,\na task optimally achievable only on quantum computers. Given continuing progress in\nthe implementability of quantum computers, we thus continue to study the theoretical\nefficiency and the limit of applicability of QA using small-size prototypes and classical\nsimulations of quantum systems, following the general spirit of quantum information\ntheory. So far, almost all problems studied with QA have been for nondegenerate cases,\nand researchers have not paid particular attention to the role played by degeneracy.\nThis question, however, needs careful scrutiny because many practical problems have\ndegenerate ground states. The present paper is a partial report on these efforts with a\nfocus on the efficiency of QA when the ground state of the studied model is degenerate,\ni.e., when different configurations of the degrees of freedom yield the same lowest-possible\nenergy.\nIf the goal of the minimization of a Hamiltonian (cost function) of a given problem\nis to obtain the ground-state energy (minimum of the cost function), it suffices to reach\none of the degenerate ground states, which might often be easier than an equivalent\nnondegenerate problem because there are many states that are energetically equivalent.\nIf, on the other hand, we are asked to identify all (or many of) the degenerate groundstate configurations (arguments of the cost function which minimize it) and not just the\nlowest value of the energy, we have to carefully check if all ground states can be found.\nThis would thus mean that the chosen algorithm can reach all possible ground-state\nconfigurations ergodically. Such a situation would happen if, for instance, we want to\ncompute the ground-state entropy or we may need the detailed spin configuration of a\nspin-glass system to understand the relationship between the distribution of frustration\nand the ground-state configurations.\nWe have investigated this problem for a few typical systems with degeneracy caused\nby frustration effects in the interactions between Ising spins. Our results indicate that\nnaive QA using transverse fields is not necessarily well suited for the identification of\nall the degenerate ground states, i.e., the method fails to find certain ground-state\nconfigurations independent of the annealing rate. This is in contrast to SA, with which\nall the degenerate states are reached with almost equal probability if the annealing rate\nof the temperature is sufficiently slow. Nevertheless, when only the ground-state energy\nis needed, QA is found to be superior to SA for some example systems.\n\n\f3\n\nGround-state statistics from annealing algorithms\n\nThe present paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the solution of a small\nsystem by direct diagonalization and numerical integration of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nSection 3 is devoted to the studies of larger degenerate systems via quantum Monte\nCarlo simulations, followed by concluding remarks in section 4.\n2. Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics for a small system\nIt is instructive to first study a small-size system by a direct solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation, both in stationary and nonstationary contexts. The classical optimization\nproblem for this purpose is chosen to be a five-spin system with interactions as shown\nin figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Five-spin toy model studied. Full lines denote\nferromagnetic interactions (Jij = 1) while dashed lines stand\nfor antiferromagnetic interactions (Jij = \u22121). Because of the\ngeometry of the problem the system has a degenerate ground\nstate by construction.\n\nThe Hamiltonian of this system is given by\nX\nJij \u03c3iz \u03c3jz ,\nH0 = \u2212\n\n(1)\n\nhiji\n\nwhere the sum is over all nearest-neighbour interactions Jij = \u00b11 and \u03c3iz denote Ising\nspins parallel to the z-axis. The system has six degenerate ground states, three of which\nare shown in figure 2. We apply a transverse field\nX\nH1 = \u2212\n\u03c3ix\n(2)\ni\n\n|1i\n\n|2i\n\n|3i\n\nFigure 2. Nontrivial degenerate ground states of the toy model shown in figure 1.\nFilled and open circles denote up and down spins, respectively. The other three ground\nstates |1\u0304i, |2\u0304i, and |3\u0304i are obtained from |1i, |2i, and |3i by reversing all spins.\n\n\fGround-state statistics from annealing algorithms\n\n4\n\nto the system H0 to induce a quantum transition between classical states. The total\nHamiltonian H(t) changes from H1 at t = 0 to H0 at t = \u03c4 , i.e.,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nt\nt\nH1 + H0 .\n(3)\nH(t) = 1 \u2212\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\nFor large \u03c4 the system is more likely to follow the instantaneous ground state according\nto the adiabatic theorem. If the target optimization Hamiltonian H0 had no degeneracy\nin the ground state, the simple adiabatic evolution (\u03c4 \u226b 1) would drive the system from\nthe trivial initial ground state of H1 to the nontrivial final ground state of H0 (solution\nof the optimization problem).\nThe situation changes significantly for the present degenerate case as illustrated in\nfigure 3, which depicts the instantaneous energy spectrum. Some of the excited states\n4\n\nEnergy\n\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\nt\u0090\u03a4\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nFigure 3. Instantaneous energy\nspectrum of the five-spin system\ndepicted in figure 1. For simplicity we have omitted the energy\nlevels that are not reachable from\nthe ground state due to different\nsymmetry properties.\n\nreach the final ground state as t/\u03c4 \u2192 1. In particular, the instantaneous ground state\nconfigurations have been found to be continuously connected to a special symmetric\ncombination of four of the final ground states at t = \u03c4 , |2i + |2\u0304i + |3i + |3\u0304i, whereas\nthe other two states |1i and |1\u0304i are out of reach as long as the system faithfully follows\nthe instantaneous ground state (\u03c4 \u226b 1). A relatively quick time evolution with an\nintermediate value of \u03c4 may catch the missed ground states. However, there is no\nguarantee that the obtained state using this procedure is a true ground state since\nsome of the final excited states may be reached. As shown in the left panel of figure\n4, intermediate values of \u03c4 around 10 give almost an even probability to all the true\nground states, an ideal situation. However, the problem is that we do not know such\nan appropriate value of \u03c4 beforehand. In contrast, the right panel of figure 4 shows\nthe result of SA by a direct numerical integration of the master equation, in which all\nthe states are reached evenly in the limit of large \u03c4 . Figure 3 suggests that it might\nbe plausible to start from one of the low-lying excited states of H1 to reach the missed\nground state. However, such a process has also been found to cause similar problems as\nabove. We therefore conclude that QA is not suitable to find all degenerate ground-state\nconfigurations of the target system H0 , at least in the present example. This aspect is to\nbe contrasted with SA, in which infinitely-slow annealing of the temperature certainly\nfinds all ground states with equal probability as assured by the theorem of Geman and\nGeman [11].\n\n\f5\n\nGround-state statistics from annealing algorithms\n|1>\n\n1.0\n\n)\n\n|3>\n\n0.6\n\n(\n\ntotal\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n10\n\n|2>\n\n0.8\n\nP\n\nP\n\n(\n\n)\n\n0.8\n\n|1>\n\n1.0\n\n|2>\n\n|3>\n\n0.6\n\ntotal\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0.0\n\n4\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\nFigure 4.

Residual energy per spin as a function of the annealing time \u03c4 for the\nfive-spin toy model. Left panel: Degenerate case. Right panel: A small perturbation\nh = 0.10 [see equation (4)] has been added to lift the overall spin-reversal symmetry\nand thus break the degeneracy. While QA is rather robust against the inclusion of a\nlongitudinal field term and the residual energy per spin decays in both cases \u223c \u03c4 \u22122 for\nlarge \u03c4 , SA seems not to converge after the inclusion of a field term. The thin lines on\nthe right panel represent the results in zero field (from the left panel) for comparison.\n\nData using SA are also shown in figure 5 using an annealing schedule of temperature\nT = (\u03c4 \u2212 t)/t, corresponding to the ratio of the first and the second terms on the righthand side of equation (3). In the degenerate case (left panel) SA outperforms QA\nsince the residual energy decays more rapidly using SA. However, if we apply a small\n\n\fGround-state statistics from annealing algorithms\n\n6\n\nlongitudinal field to H0\nH2 = \u2212h\n\n5\nX\n\n\u03c3iz\n\n(4)\n\ni=1\n\nand regard H0 + H2 as the target Hamiltonian to be minimized, the situation changes\ndrastically: The convergence of SA slows down significantly while the convergence of\nQA remains almost intact (right panel of figure 5). As already observed in the simple\ndouble-well potential problem [12], the energy barrier between the two almost degenerate\nstates of H0 + H2 may be too high to be surmountable by SA whereas the width of the\nbarrier remains thin enough to allow for quantum tunnelling to keep QA working.\nIt is relatively straightforward to modify the type of quantum fluctuations to force\nthe system to finally reach all ground states with equal probability. The following term\nX\nX\nX\nH1\u2032 = \u2212\n\u03c3ix \u2212\n\u03c3ix \u03c3jx \u2212\n\u03c3ix \u03c3jx \u03c3kx \u2212 * * *\n(5)\ni\n\nhi,ji\n\nhi,j,ki\n\nis used instead of H1 of equation (2) to induce direct quantum transitions between\nall states. This modified quantum term is not unnatural in view of the quantumannealing version of the Grover algorithm [13], in which the quantum term connects all\nstates with equal transition amplitude. The result for the five-spin model is shown in\nfigure 6 (left panel), in which all states are found with equal probability as expected.\nAs depicted in the right panel of figure 6, the scaling of the residual energy still shows\nthe 1/\u03c4 2 behavior, although an order of magnitude slower. A drawback of this method\nis that it is not easily implemented by Monte Carlo simulations because of complicated\ninteractions appearing in the path-integral representation of equation (5). We therefore\nrestrict the use of this method to the present section, and Monte Carlo simulations in\nthe next section will be carried out only for the simple transverse-field case of equation\n(2).\n3. Monte Carlo simulations for larger systems\nThe simplest Ising model which possesses an exponentially-large ground-state\ndegeneracy (in the system size) is the two-dimensional Villain fully-frustrated Ising\nmodel [14]. The Ising model is defined on a square lattice of size N = L \u00d7 L and has\nalternating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in the horizontal direction\nand ferromagnetic interactions in the vertical direction; see figure 7. We use periodic\nboundary conditions and show the data for L = 4 and 6 with M = 1/T = 100, where M\nis the number of Trotter slices and T the temperature. We follow Ref. [15] and choose\nT = 1/M to ensure an optimal performance of quantum Monte Carlo simulations applied\nP\nto quantum annealing. A transverse field H1 = \u2212\u0393 (t) i \u03c3ix is applied, followed by a\npre-annealing of the system by decreasing the temperature as T = 100/Mt from t = 0\nto 100. After the pre-annealing, the transverse field is decreased (t is set to 0) by the\nschedule \u0393 (t) = (\u03c4 \u2212 t)/t from t = 0 to \u03c4 with T fixed.

Right panel: Residual energy per spin as a function of the\nannealing time \u03c4 for the modified Hamiltonian. The solid line corresponds to QA using\nonly a transverse field and is depicted for comparison (data from figure 5).\n\ntarget Hamiltonian H0 is given by \u2212L2 . We can therefore check easily if each Trotter\nslice has reached one of the ground states.\nFigure 7. Fully-frustrated Ising model with N =\n36 spins (dots) and periodic boundary conditions.\nThe system has 45088 degenerate ground states\nexcluding spin-reversal symmetry. For comparison,\nfor L = 4 the system has only 136 degenerate ground\nstates. The horizontal bonds alternate between\nferromagnetic (full lines) and antiferromagnetic\n(dashed lines) signs. The vertical bonds are all\nferromagnetic. This ensures that the product of\nall bonds around any plaquette is negative, i.e., the\nsystem is maximally frustrated.\n\nFigures 8 and 9 show the relative number of ground-state hits versus the groundstate numbering (sorted by the number of hits). While a small part of the total set\nof ground states are reached very frequently, some ground states seem exponentially\nsuppressed in QA. The result is practically independent of the chosen value of the\nannealing time \u03c4 in the Monte Carlo simulation and coincides with data from the\ndiagonalization of the Hamiltonian corresponding to the adiabatic limit (\u03c4 \u226b 1) of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger dynamics. We may thus conclude that our Monte Carlo simulations with\nsmall but finite T = 1/M approximate well the final state of the adiabatic Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation. In figure 9 we show the relative number of ground-state hits versus the\nground-state numbering for SA. In contrast to QA, SA finds almost all ground states\nwith uniform probability. While some ground states seem to be preferred, all ground\nstates can be reached with a frequency of at least 40% (see also Ref. [16]).\n\n\f8\n\nGround-state statistics from annealing algorithms\n0\n\n10\n\n1.0\n8\n\n0.4\n\n= 100\n0.2\n\n2\n\n= 300\ndiagonalization\n\n0.0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n0\n100 120 140\n\n= 300\n= 1000\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n1.0\n\n16\n\n0.8\n\n12\n\n0.6\n\n8\n\n0.4\n\n4\n\n0.2\n0.0\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n50 100 150 200 250\n\n# of free spins\n\n4\n\nFrequency\n\n6\n\n0.6\n\n# of free spins\n\nFrequency\n\n0.8\n\n= 100\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n10000 20000 30000 40000\n\nFigure 8.

Figure 10 shows typical spin configurations of states with high frequency (top\npanel) and low frequency (bottom panel). The number of free spins (the spins that can\nbe flipped without energy cost) is much larger in the former that in the latter. In figure\n8 we also show the number of free spins which clearly shows that the states with more\nfree spins are reached more frequently. A classical ground state with a larger number\nof free spins would have a lower energy than a state with fewer free spins under a small\nperturbation of the transverse field because the spins flipped by the transverse field\nare less likely to be free spins in the latter case with fewer free spins, resulting in high\nenergies. An alternative view is provided if we map a ground-state spin configuration\nonto a (directed) dimer configuration on the dual lattice by connecting neighbouring\nplaquettes across an unsatisfied bond [17, 18]. The flip of a free spin in real space\ncorresponds to a dimer plaquette flip. Then the high-frequency configurations in the\n\n\fGround-state statistics from annealing algorithms\n\n9\n\nFigure 10. Typical examples of the high-frequency configurations (top panels) and\nlow-frequency configurations (bottom panels). Filled and open circles denote up and\ndown spins, respectively. Circled spins can be flipped independently without energy\nchanges (free spins).\n\ntop panel of figure 10 correspond to dimer configurations with low winding numbers and\nthe low-frequency configurations to large winding numbers \u2021; the former being easier to\nflip.\nWe should, however, be careful to assume that these pictures always explains the\nsituation because we have found a counterexample in the \u00b1J Ising model with L = 10.\nA possible reason is that the number of free spins is relatively small for this spin-glass\nsystem in comparison with the Villain model, which would lead to weaker effects of spin\nflips due to quantum fluctuations. Further studies are required to clarify this point.\nWe next analyze the residual energy. The top two panels of figure 11 show the\nresults for the Villain model with the system size L = 40 for QA and SA. The abscissa\nis the annealing time \u03c4 (Monte Carlo steps) multiplied by the number of Trotter slices\nM for a fair comparison between QA and SA. The left panel is for the average final\nenergy over all Trotter slices and the right panel represents the lowest energy among all\nTrotter slices. The data for SA follow a rapid decrease beyond \u03c4 \u2248 2 \u00d7 103 , whereas\nQA (the average energy) stays unimproved beyond this region. While QA for the best\nenergy keeps improving further at lower T (larger M), QA does not surpass SA in this\n\u2021 We thank one of the referees for pointing this out.\n\n\f10\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\nVillain\n(average)\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\nM=10\n\n-3\n\nM=30\n-4\n\nM=100\nM=300\n\n-5\n\nM=1000\nSA\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n3\n\n4\n\nM\n\n10\n\nx\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n7\n\n\u00b1J\n(average)\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nM=3\n-2\n\nM=10\n\n10\n\nM=30\nM=100\n\n-3\n\n10\n\nM=300\nM=1000\nSA\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nM\n4\n\n10\n\nx\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\nGaussian SG\n(average)\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\nM=10\nM=30\n\n-3\n\nM=100\nM=300\n\n-4\n\nM=1000\nSA\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nM\n\n10\n\nx\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n7\n\nResidual Energy (per spin)\n\n10\n\n0\n\nResidual Energy (per spin)\n\n10\n\nResidual Energy (per spin)\n\nResidual Energy (per spin)\n\nResidual Energy (per spin)\n\nResidual Energy (per spin)\n\nGround-state statistics from annealing algorithms\n0\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\nVillain\n(best)\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\nM=10\n\n-3\n\nM=30\n-4\n\nM=100\nM=300\n\n-5\n\nM=1000\nSA\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n10\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\nM\n\n10\n\nx\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n7\n\n\u00b1J\n(best)\n\n-1\n\nM=3\n\n10\n10\n\n-2\n\nM=10\nM=30\nM=100\n\n-3\n\nM=300\nM=1000\n\n10\n\nSA\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nx\n\n4\n\nM\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n7\n\nGaussian SG\n(best)\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\nM=10\nM=30\n\n-3\n\nM=100\nM=300\n\n-4\n\nM=1000\nSA\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nx\n\n4\n\nM\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n6\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\nFigure 11. Residual energy per spin using QA and SA for the Villain model with\nL = 40 (top panels), the \u00b1J model with L = 40 (middle panels) and the Gaussian spin\nglass with L = 10 (bottom panels). The number of samples for the bond randomness\nis 50 for the \u00b1J model and 100 for the Gaussian model, and the number of runs are\nover 100 for the random seedings. We take averages over all samples and calculate the\naverage energy (left panels) and lowest energy (right panels) among all Trotter slices.\nErrors are smaller than the symbols.\n\nannealing time region.\nFinally, we also show the data for the two-dimensional \u00b1J Ising spin glass (middle\npanels) and Gaussian spin glass with a weak longitudinal field (h = 0.1) (bottom panels)\nin order to remove a trivial degeneracy. In fact, the latter model does not have a ground-\n\n\fGround-state statistics from annealing algorithms\n\n11\n\nstate degeneracy whereas the Villain model and the \u00b1J model have quite a large number\nof ground states. In the \u00b1J and the Gaussian cases the situation is quite different,\nsince the residual energy using QA decreases more rapidly than SA. Furthermore, the\nperformance of QA improves for smaller T (larger M) in the large-\u03c4 region. At high\ntemperature annealing (smaller M) it seems that the data of QA are saturated for large\n\u03c4 . This saturation may reflect the finiteness of the temperature of QA. For the \u00b1J and\nGaussian models it seems that QA is a powerful tool, as witnessed in previous studies\n[1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15].\n4. Conclusion\nWe have studied the performance of QA for systems with degeneracy in the ground\nstate of the target Hamiltonian. Our results show that naive QA with quantum effects\ninduced by a transverse field reaches only a limited part of the set of degenerate groundstate configurations and misses the other states. The instantaneous energy spectrum\nas a function of time, figure 3, is a useful tool to understand the situation: some of\nthe excited states merge into the final ground states as t/\u03c4 \u2192 1. It is usually difficult,\nhowever, to initially select the appropriate excited states which reach the ground state\nwhen t/\u03c4 \u2192 1. We therefore have to be biased a priori in the state search by QA for\ndegenerate cases. An introduction of quantum transitions to all other states significantly\nimproves the situation, leading to a uniform probability to find degenerate ground states,\nbut with the penalty of slower convergence. Simulations of the two-dimensional Villain\nmodel show that certain ground-state configurations are exponentially suppressed when\nusing QA, whereas this is not the case for SA. It has been found that the number of\nfree spins is closely related to the frequency that the ground states are found by QA.\nA ground state with a larger number of free spins is more stable than the others. On\nthe other hand, if the problem is to only determine the ground-state energy, QA is\noften (but not necessarily always) an efficient method, as exemplified in figures 5 and 11\nwhere the residual energies are shown. Thus, it is necessary to construct an analytical\ntheory-based on the numerical evidence-to establish criteria when to (and when not\nto) use QA.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Dr. Shu Tanaka for bringing the effects of free spins to our attention (section\n3).
