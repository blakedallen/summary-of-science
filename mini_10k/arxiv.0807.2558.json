Sin e its \u001crst dis overy in the early\neighties SR has been observed in a great variety of systems pertaining to di\u001berent dis iplines su h as physi s,\nhemistry, engineering, biology and biomedi al s ien es\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\u2104. The list of models and appli ations is still growing. In parti ular, SR has found\nwidespread interests and appli ations within biologi al\nphysi s.\nThe resear h on SR has primarily been fo used on systems with purely energeti potentials. However, in situations frequently found in soft ondensed matter and\nbiologi al systems, parti les move in onstrained regions\nsu h as small avities, pores or hannels whose presen e and shape play an important role for the SRdynami s [10\u2104, sometimes even more important than the\nwell-studied ase of energeti barriers in su h systems\n[11, 12, 13, 14\u2104. In this work, we demonstrate that irregularities in the form of on\u001cning, urved boundaries,\nbeing modeled via an entropi potential, an ause noiseassisted, resonant-like behaviors in the system under onsideration. Con\u001cnement, an inherent property of smalls ale systems, an thus onstitute an important sour e\nof noise-indu ed resonant e\u001be ts with interesting appliations in the design and ontrol of these systems.\nThe phenomenon of SR is rooted on a sto hasti synhronization between noise-indu ed hopping events and\nthe rhythm of the externally applied signal, that taken\nalone is not su\u001e ient for the system to over ome a potential barrier. In the \u001crst pla e, noise enables system\ntransitions and it is in fa t responsible for the observed\nsignal ampli\u001c ation and the emergen e of ertain degree\nof order. In the earliest and basi manifestation of SR,\nthe syn hronization of the random swit hes of a Brownian parti le with a periodi driving for e were observed\nfor a bistable potential. Moreover, potentials of this type\nare not only found in systems with energy barriers, as\n\n~\nG\n\nb\nLy\n\ny\nx\n\nF~ (t)\n\nLx\n\nFIG. 1: S hemati illustration of the two-dimensional stru ture on\u001cning the motion of the Brownian parti les. The\nsymmetri stru ture is de\u001cned by a quarti double well fun tion, f. Eq. (2), involving the geometri al parameters Lx ,\nLy and b. Brownian parti les are driven by a sinusoidal for e\n~ (t) along the longitudinal dire tion and a onstant for e G\n~\nF\nin the transversal dire tion.\n\nthey may also arise due to the in\u001duen e of entropi onstraints. Parti les di\u001busing freely in a on\u001cned medium\nsu h as the one depi ted in Fig. 1 may give rise to an\n~ in the transa tivation regime when a onstant for e G\nverse dire tion is imposed. We will show that the ombination of for ing and the presen e of entropi e\u001be ts\nderiving from the on\u001cnement and the irregularity of the\nboundaries give rise to an e\u001be tive bistable potential that\nexhibits the signatures of Sto hasti Resonan e.\nThe dynami s of a parti le in a onstrained geometry\nsubje ted to a sinusoidal os illating for e F (t) along the\naxis of the stru ture and to a onstant for e G in the\ntransversal dire tion an be des ribed by means of the\nLangevin equation, written in the overdamped limit as\n\u03b3\n\np\nd~r\n~ ,\n= \u2212Ge~y \u2212 F (t)e~x + \u03b3 kB T \u03be(t)\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ~r denotes the position of the parti le, \u03b3 is the\nfri tion oe\u001e ient, e~x and e~y the unit ve tors along the\n~\nx and y -dire tions, respe tively, and \u03be(t)\nis a Gaussian\nwhite noise with zero mean whi h obeys the \u001du tuationdissipation relation h\u03bei (t) \u03bej (t\u2032 )i = 2 \u03b4ij \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) for i, j =\nx, y . The expli it form of the longitudinal for e is given\nby F (t) = F0 sin(\u03a9t) where F0 is the amplitude and \u03a9 is\nthe frequen y of the sinusoidal driving.\n\n\f2\nIn the presen e of on\u001cning boundaries, this equation\nhas to be solved by imposing re\u001de ting boundary onditions at the walls of the stru ture. For the 2D stru ture\ndepi ted in Fig. 1, the walls are de\u001cned by\nwl (x) = Ly\n\n\u0012\n\nx\nLx\n\n\u00134\n\n\u2212 2 Ly\n\n\u0012\n\nx\nLx\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2212\n\nb\n= \u2212wu (x) , (2)\n2\n\nwhere wl and wu orrespond to the lower and the upper boundary fun tions, respe tively, Lx orresponds\nto the distan e between bottlene k position and position of maximal width, and Ly refers to the narrowing of the boundary fun tions and b to the remaining width at the bottlene k, f. Fig. 1. Consequently,\n2 w(x) = wu (x)\u2212 wl (x) gives the lo al width of the stru ture. This hoi e of the geometry is intended to resemble\nthe ar hetype setup for SR in the ontext of a double\nwell potential. In fa t, in the limit of a su\u001e iently large\ntransversal for e, the parti le is in pra ti e restri ted to\nexplore the region very lose to the lower boundary of the\nstru ture, re overing the e\u001be t of an energeti bistable\npotential. For sake of a dimensionless des ription, we\nhen eforth s ale all lengths by the hara teristi length\nLx , i.e. x\u0303 = x/Lx , \u1ef9 = y/Lx whi h implies b\u0303 = b/Lx and\nw\u0303l = wl /Lx = \u2212w\u0303u , time by \u03c4 = \u03b3Lx 2 /kB TR , the orresponding hara teristi di\u001busion time at an arbitrary,\nbut irrelevant referen e temperature TR , i.e. t\u0303 = t/\u03c4 and\n\u03a9\u0303 = \u03a9\u03c4 , and for e by FR = \u03b3Lx /\u03c4 , transversal for e\nG\u0303 = G/FR and a longitudinally a ting, sinusoidal for e\nF\u0303 (t\u0303) = F (t)/FR . In the following we shall omit the tilde\nsymbols for better legibility. In dimensionless form the\nLangevin-equation (1) and the boundary fun tions (2)\nread:\n\u221a\nd~r\n~ ,\n= \u2212Ge~y \u2212 F (t)e~x + D \u03be(t)\ndt\nwl (x) = \u2212wu (x) = \u2212w(x) = \u01ebx4 \u2212 2\u01ebx2 \u2212 b/2 ,\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere we de\u001cned the aspe t ratio \u01eb = Ly /Lx and the\ndimensionless temperature D = T /TR.\nIn the absen e of a time-dependent applied bias, i.e.\nF (t) = 0, it has been shown by a oarsening of the des ription [15, 16, 17\u2104 that the Langevin equation (1) an\nbe redu ed to an e\u001be tive 1D-Fokker-Plan k equation,\nreading in dimensionless form\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u2202P\n\u2202\n\u2202P (x, t)\nD\n=\n+ V \u2032 (x, D) P ,\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n\u0014\n\n2D\nsinh\nV (x, D) = \u2212D ln\nG\n\n\u0012\n\nGw(x)\nD\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nand the prime refers to the derivative with respe t to\nx. This equation des ribes the motion of a Brownian\nparti le in a bistable potential of entropi nature. Remarkably, the e\u001be tive potential does not only depend\non the energeti ontribution of the for e G, but also\n\non the temperature and the geometry of the stru ture\nin a non-trivial way. Notably, for the vanishing width\nat the two opposite orners of the geometry in Fig. (1)\nthis entropi potential approa hes in\u001cnity, thus intrinsially a ounting for a natural re\u001de ting boundary. It is\nimportant to emphasize that this bistable potential was\nnot present in the 2D Langevin dynami s, but arises due\nto the entropi restri tions asso iated to the on\u001cnement.\nIn general, after the oarse-graining the di\u001busion oe\u001eient will depend on the oordinate x as well, but sin e\nin our ase |w\u2032 (x)| \u226a 1, this orre tion an be safely\nnegle ted, f. Ref. [15, 17, 18, 19, 20\u2104.\nIt is interesting to analyze the two limiting situations\nthat an be obtained upon varying the value of the ratio between the energy asso iated to the transversal for e\nand the thermal energy. For the energy-dominated ase,\ni.e. Gw(x)/D \u226b 1, Eq. (6) yields V (x) = \u2212Gw(x) (negle ting irrelevant onstants). In the opposite limit, i.e.\nfor Gw(x)/D \u226a 1, the orresponding entropi potential\nfun tion reads V (x, D) = \u2212D ln[2 w(x)].\nTwo-state approximation.- It is instru tive to analyze\nthe o urren e of sto hasti resonan e in the ontext of\nthe two-state approximation.

(10)\n\nThe numeri al integration of the 1D kineti equation\n(10) was done by spatial dis retization, using a Chebyshev ollo ation method, and employing the method of\nlines to redu e the kineti equation to a system of ordinary di\u001berential equations, whi h was solved using a\nba kward di\u001berentiation formula method. This results in\nthe time-dependent probability distribution P (x, t) and\nthe time-dependent mean value, de\u001cned as\nhx(t)i =\n\nZ\n\nx P (x, t)dx .\n\n(11)\n\nIn the long-time limit this mean value approa hes the periodi ity of driving [22\u2104 with angular frequen y \u03a9. After\na Fourier-expansion of hx(t)i one \u001cnds the amplitude M1\nof the \u001crst harmoni of the output signal.

Eqs. (9) and (12), demonstrates the apability of\nthe two-state approximation for small driving frequen ies\nand amplitudes, f. Fig. 2.\n1D modelling vs. pre ise numeri s (2D).- In order to\nhe k the a ura y of the des ription we ompared the\nresults obtained by the 1D modelling with the results of\nBrownian dynami simulations, performed by integration\nof the overdamped Langevin equation (1), for a 2D stru ture (see Fig. 1) whose shape is des ribed by Eq. (2). In\nour ase we have used the aspe t ratio \u01eb = 1/4 and the\nbottlene k width b = 0.02. The simulations were arried\nout by the use of the standard sto hasti Euler-algorithm.\nFig. 3 depi ts the dependen e of the spe tral ampli\u001c ation \u03b7 on the noise strength for di\u001berent values of\nthe driving frequen y, the driving amplitude and the\nvalue of G. It is important to point out that the results obtained from the 1D modelling using the 1Dapproximation (lines) are in ex ellent agreement with\nthe numeri al simulations of the full system (2D) (symbols) within a small relative error. This agreement is\ndue to the fa t that the onsidered potential fun tion is\na smooth fun tion (|w\u2032 (x)| \u226a 1), and in this situation\nour employed 1D-approximation is expe ted to be ome\nvery a urate [15, 17, 18\u2104.\nFig. 3a shows the dependen e of the spe tral ampli\u001c ation \u03b7 on the noise strength D for various driving\nfrequen ies at a \u001cxed transversal for e and for ing amplitude F0 . Here, we observe an in rease in the spe tral\nampli\u001c ation whi h gives rise to the \u001cnding of the e\u001be t\nof Sto hasti Resonan e in the presen e of entropi barriers. As observed for the usual \"energy-dominated\" SR [1\u2104\nthe resonan e peak is more pronoun ed as the applied angular frequen y \u03a9 of the input signal de reases. Similarly,\nFig. 3b depi ts how ESR depends on the strength of the\ntransversal for e G. Interestingly, the maximal ampli\u001cation in reases upon de reasing the strength G of the\ntransversal for e. However, the presen e of the transversal for e G is ru ial for observing a non-monotoni behavior of the spe tral ampli\u001c ation with in reasing noise\nlevel D. In the limit of G \u2192 0, the spe tral ampli\u001c ation in reases monotoni ally with de reasing noise level\nand tends asymptoti ally to 1/\u03a92 at small driving amplitudes F0 . Finally, Fig. 3 displays the dependen e of\nthe spe tral ampli\u001c ation \u03b7 on the noise strength D for\nvarious amplitudes of the driving for e F0 at a \u001cxed value\nof the transversal for e and driving frequen y. Both, the\nampli\u001c ation of the signal and the optimal value of the\nnoise at whi h it o urs seemingly in rease as the driving\namplitude de reases.\nThis novel ESR e\u001be t is hara terized by the appearan e of a maximum in the spe tral ampli\u001c ation as a\nfun tion of the noise strength D, just as in onventional\nenergy-dominated SR [1\u2104. However, in biologi al and\npra ti al systems the temperature whi h ontrols the\nstrength of the thermal noise is not a readily variable\nparameter. Our results suggest that, for a given temperature, a proper hoi e of the externally ontrolled pa-\n\n\f4\nrameters (i.e. the nature of the driving for e, i.e., its\namplitude and driving frequen y and the strength of the\ntransversal for e) might bring the system into an optimal regime where on\u001cnement and noise mutually interplay to boost noise-assisted transport inside a orrugated\nstru ture.\n\n\u03a9 = 0.01\n\u03a9 = 0.1\n\u03a9 = 0.2\n\n(a)\n\n\u03b7\n\n1\n\n0.5\nG = 5.0\nF0 = 1.0\n0\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.75\n\n1\n\nD\n1.5\n\n\u03b7\n\nG = 2.0\nG = 3.0\nG = 5.0\n\n(b)\n\n1\n\u03a9 = 0.1\nF0 = 0.5\n\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n0.75\n\n1\n\nD\n(c)\n\n\u03b7\n\n0.75\n0.5\n\nF0 = 0.5\n\n0.25\n\nF0 = 1.0\nF0 = 1.5\n\n0\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.5\n\n\u03a9 = 0.1\nG = 5.0\n0.75\n\nIn on lusion, we have elu idated a new me hanism\nleading to the appearan e of noise-indu ed resonant effe ts when a Brownian parti le moves in a on\u001cned\nmedium in the presen e of periodi driving.
