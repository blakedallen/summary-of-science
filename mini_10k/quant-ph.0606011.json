The total in-state is the direct product of these density\nmatrices and is separable. The interaction provides the mechanism for entanglement and the final state is generally\nnot separable. This paper studies this kind of dynamical entanglement in scattering. This subject has recently\nreceived increased interest [1, 13].\nIn particular, this work investigates how entanglement is dynamically generated in elastic, non-relativistic, twoparticle scattering processes. The following questions will receive attention: (1) What kinds of entanglement occur\nin non-relativistic particle scattering? Non-relativistic particles have continuous (e.g., momentum) and discrete (spin\ncomponent) degrees of freedom, and therefore the state space has a richer structure and allows for different manifestations of entanglement. (2) How do conservation laws limit the dynamics of entanglement? Since the dynamical\nevolution of the system must respect global Galilean invariance, not all entangling operations can arise through scattering processes. (3) How do the boundary conditions of scattering affect the dynamics of entanglement? The in-state\nmust be separable. What other requirements on the interaction and on the in-state are necessary or sufficient so that\nentanglement is generated?\nThese questions do not have complete answers. In what follows, techniques from symmetry representations in\nquantum mechanics, like Clebsch-Gordan methods, will be combined with the S-matrix formulation of scattering\ndynamics to give partial answers and uncover new avenues for further inquiry. Only pure states will be considered.\nII.\n\nSCATTERING SPIN SYSTEMS\n\nTo develop intuition and some terminology, we first consider a simpler model of scattering. We will neglect the\nmomentum degrees of freedom of non-relativistic particles and consider only the effect of scattering on the spin\ndegrees of freedom. In other words, we can consider two spin systems interacting for some finite time interval by a\nrotationally-invariant interaction (the relevant global symmetry). As will be discussed below, low-energy scattering\nby a central interaction approximates the model of scattering spin systems.\nFor simplicity, we consider the scattering interaction of two spin-1/2 systems, particle A and particle B. The Hilbert\nspace for two spin-1/2 systems is the tensor product of each particle's Hilbert space HAB = HA \u2297 HB . Since the free\nsystems before and after the interaction have rotational symmetry, each Hi is the representation space for the unitary\nirreducible representation (UIR) D(1/2) of SU(2). For the in-state and out-state, we will use the spin component basis,\ni.e.\nS3A |\u00b1iA = \u00b1(~/2)|\u00b1iA .\n\n(1)\n\nWe assume that the two systems are initially in pure states of spin and that they have never interacted before. The\ncoordinates can always be chosen so that the initial state of particle A is |\u03c6in\nA i = |+iA . Then, except for an overall\n\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: harshman@american.edu\n\n\f2\nphase, the most general state for the second particle is\ni\u03c6/2\n|\u03c6in\nsin(\u03b8/2)|\u2212iB ,\nB i = cos(\u03b8/2)|+iB + e\n\n(2)\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0 and 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 4\u03c0. The total in-state |\u03c6in i is the direct product\n|\u03c6in i = cos(\u03b8/2)| + +i + ei\u03c6/2 sin(\u03b8/2)| + \u2212i,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere, for example, | + +i = |+iA \u2297 |+iB . This is a stationary state of the free Hamiltonian before the scattering.\nScattering brings the spin degrees of freedom into contact with each other. After the interaction is over, the new outstate |\u03c6out i will again be a stationary state of the free Hamiltonian. The dynamics of scattering can be represented by\nthe unitary S-operator which transforms the in-state into the out-state S|\u03c6in i = |\u03c6out i. As a consequence of rotational\nsymmetry, the S-operator must satisfy the relation\n[S, S] = 0\n\n(4)\n\nwhere S is the total spin operator with component operators Si = SiA \u2297 I + I \u2297 SiB . Since S is a vector operator\nand the S-matrix is a scalar operator, the Wigner-Eckart theorem tells us that the S-matrix can only be a function of\ntotal spin s. Therefore, dynamics will be more transparent if we decompose the total Hilbert space into a direct sum\nof UIRs of the global symmetry HA \u2297 HA = Hs=0 \u2295 Hs=1 . The in-state (3) is transformed into the total spin basis\n|ss3 i using the standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the rotation group to get\n1\n|\u03c6in i = cos(\u03b8/2)|11i + \u221a ei\u03c6/2 sin(\u03b8/2) (|10i + |00i) .\n2\n\n(5)\n\nUnitarity constrains the S-operator and the S-matrix in the direct sum basis has the form\nhss3 |S|s\u2032 s\u20323 i = e2i\u03b4s \u03b4ss\u2032 \u03b4s3 s\u20323 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b4s are the phase shifts. All possible dynamics in spin-1/2 scattering systems can be specified by two parameters\n\u03b40 \u2208 [0, \u03c0) and \u03b41 \u2208 [0, \u03c0). Further, we expect that a global phase is irrelevant and so only the difference (\u03b40 \u2212 \u03b41 ) \u2208\n(\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0) should affect physical observations.\nUsing (3) and (6), the most general out-state (within the chosen coordinate system) is\n|\u03c6out i = S|\u03c6in i\n\n\u0001\n1\n= cos(\u03b8/2)e2i\u03b41 |11i + \u221a ei\u03c6/2 sin(\u03b8/2) e2i\u03b41 |10i + e2i\u03b40 |00i\n2\n2i\u03b41\n= cos(\u03b8/2)e | + +i\n\b\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n+ ei\u03c6/2 sin(\u03b8/2) e2i\u03b41 + e2i\u03b40 | + \u2212i + e2i\u03b41 \u2212 e2i\u03b40 | \u2212 +i .\n2\n\n(7)\n\nSo for this simple model, four parameters {\u03c6, \u03b8, \u03b40 , \u03b41 } are sufficient to describe every possible in-state (the first two\nparameters) and all dynamics arising from central forces (the second two). We now turn to the three questions\nmentioned in the introduction.\nWhat kinds of entanglement occur in non-relativistic particle scattering? In this model, the global Hilbert space\nis finite dimensional and can be factored into the direct product of two Hilbert subspaces. Therefore, the entropy of\nentanglement (EoE) provides an unambiguous measure of entanglement in pure states. For the full case of momentum\nand spin degrees of freedom, the answer to this question is more complicated, as will be discussed below.\nCalculating the EoE of (7), we find\ni\nh\n(8)\nE(|\u03c6out i) = 1 \u2212 log2 (1 + x)(1+x) (1 \u2212 x)(1\u2212x) ,\nwhere\nx=\n\nq\n1 \u2212 sin4 (\u03b8/2) sin2 (2\u2206\u03b4)\n\n(9)\n\nand \u2206\u03b4 = \u03b40 \u2212 \u03b41 . The EoE (8) has a maximum E = 1 when x = 0 and a minimum E = 0 (no entanglement) when\nx = 1.\nHow do symmetries limit the dynamics of entanglement? In this case, rotational symmetry means that the S-matrix\nmust have the highly-restricted form (6). From (8), we see that the phase shift difference \u2206\u03b4 determines whether\n\n\f3\nthe dynamics can be entangling. In particular, we see that only for \u2206\u03b4 = \u00b1\u03c0/4 can the S-operator lead to maximal\nentanglement. Such operators have been called perfect entanglers [14] because they are operators which can take an\nunentangled vector to a maximally-entangled vector.\nHow do the boundary conditions of scattering affect the dynamics of entanglement? The EoE of the in-state is zero\nby construction as a consequence of the assumption of inital independence of the particles. For which initial states are\nthere perfectly-entangling dynamics? In other words, for which values of \u03c6 and \u03b8 are there solutions to E(|\u03c6out i) = 1?\nThe phase \u03c6 is unimportant, and only when \u03b8 = \u03c0 is the in-state |\u03c6in i = | + \u2212i maximally-entangleable. This in-state\nhas equal components in both partial waves. Even then, maximal entanglement can only occur for \u2206\u03b4 = \u00b1\u03c0/4. In\nthis case, the out-state is\n1\n|\u03c6out i = \u03c9 \u221a (| + \u2212i \u2213 i| \u2212 +i)\n2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere there is an overall phase \u03c9 = exp(i\u03c6/2) exp(2i\u03b41 ) exp(\u00b1i\u03c0/4).\nThe lessons of the toy model can be summarized as follows: Enforcing global symmetry limits the set of perfectlyentangling dynamical operators and the sets of separable in-states that can be perfectly entangled. For some instates, no entanglement is possible for any dynamics. Finally, only a limited set of maximally-entangled out-states\nare accessible via dynamical entanglement.\nIII.\n\nTHE FULL PROBLEM\n\nNext we discuss the problem of entanglement in non-relativistic scattering. We will attempt to show that all of\nthe above observations also appear to be true for the full problem, although there are many complications and many\nother kinds of entanglement phenomena can occur.\nThe first step is to cast the mathematics in terms of the language of symmetry. The symmetry group is now the\nGalilean group G (or, more properly, its quantum-mechanical covering group G\u0303). UIRs of G\u0303 are associated with a\nsingle, free, non-relativistic particles [15]. They are denoted D(m,w,s) and are characterized by invariant mass m,\ninternal energy w, and spin s. The representation space is denoted H(m,w,s) . Eigenkets of momentum and spin\ncomponent |p, s3 (mws)i \u2208 (\u03a6(m,w,s) )\u00d7 form a basis for a dense subspace \u03a6(m,w,s) \u2282 H(m,w,s) of well-behaved vectors\n(see Ref. ([16]) for details). Unlike in the case of relativistic particles, the space \u03a6(m,w,s) can be factorized into the\ndirect product of momentum and spin degrees of freedom:\n\u03a6(m,w,s) = \u03a6(m,w) \u2297 H(2s+1) .\n\n(11)\n\nin\nin\n(mi ,wi ,si )\nIt is assumed that a pure in-state is separable, i.e. |\u03c6in i = |\u03c6in\n. The S-operator\nA i \u2297 |\u03c6B i where |\u03c6i i \u2208 \u03a6\nin\nout\ntransforms |\u03c6 i to |\u03c6 i, and if the scattering is elastic, then we have\n\n|\u03c6out i \u2208 \u03a6(m1 ,w1 ,s1 ) \u2297 \u03a6(m2 ,w2 ,s2 ) ,\n\n(12)\n\nbut in general it will no longer be separable. Because of global Galilean invariance, the S-matrix will have a very\nrestricted set of non-zero matrix elements, just as in the spin system model. To exploit this, we can use ClebschGordan methods to separate the direct product of single-particle UIRs into a direct sum of UIRs labeled by the global\ninvariants:\nM\n\u03a6(m1 ,w1 ,s1 ) \u2297 \u03a6(m2 ,w2 ,s2 ) =\n\u03a6(M,W,j)[\u03b71 ,\u03b72 ] ,\n(13)\nM,W,j,\u03b7\n\nwhere the set {M, W, j} are the labels of the UIR and are global Galilean invariants with ranges that depend on the\nsinle particle invariants [15]. The same set of invariants may appear more than once in the direct sum; \u03b71 , \u03b72 label the\ndegeneracy. In standard analysis, these are chosen to be the total spin angular momentum s and the orbital angular\nmomentum l and this process is called partial wave analysis.\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients can be used to transform the wave functions between the direct product basis\nB B\n|pA , sA\n3 (mA wA sA )i \u2297 |p , s3 (mB wB sB )i and the UIR direct sum basis with spin-orbit coupling |pj3 (M W j)[ls]i =\n|pj3 ni. In the direct sum basis, because of Galilean invariance, the S-matrix will have the form [17].\nhpj3 n|S|p\u2032 j3\u2032 n\u2032 i = N (M, W )\u03b4 3 (p \u2212 p\u2032 )\u03b4(W \u2212 W \u2032 )\u03b4jj \u2032 \u03b4j3 j3\u2032 hls||S(W j) ||l\u2032 s\u2032 i,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere N (M, W ) is determined by the normalization of the basis kets and \u03b4j3 j3\u2032 hls||S(W j) ||l\u2032 s\u2032 i is the reduced matrix\nelement that mixes spin and orbital angular momentum.\n\n\f4\nWhat kinds of entanglement occur in this kind of scattering? A much wider variety, because when two nonrelativistic particles interact, the total Hilbert space cab be decomposed into the direct product of four independent\nsubspaces, two for each particle's spin and two for momentum. Tracing out the degrees of freedom of only one of\nthese constituant spaces could result in a mixed state, pointing toward entanglement. Taking a trace over different\ncombinations could lead to EoEs associated with two-particle spin entanglement, two-particle momentum entanglement, internal entanglement between one particle's spin and momentum, and mixed varieties. Even in-states with\nindependent particles could have entanglement present in the form of internal spin-momentum entanglement.\nJust like the spin system model, where global rotational symmetry limits when and how dynamical entanglement\noccurs, global Galilean symmetry has consequences for the dynamics and entanglement: not all unitary transformations are possible, so not all interactions are entangling. Further, not all separable in-states may be entangleable.\nThe interplay between the symmetry of the dynamics and the boundary conditions of scattering could lead to some\nstates that do not become entangled by any interaction, others that entangle under a wide class of interactions, and\nexhanges between different kinds of entanglement.\nWe conclude with one simple example that connects the full problem back to the spin systems model. In the case of\ncentral interactions, l and s are also separately conserved. Then a more convenient basis to understand the dynamics\nof entanglement is the l-s basis |pl3 s3 (M W )[ls]i = |pl3 s3 \u00f1i, and the S-matrix elements in this basis are [17]\nhpl3 s3 \u00f1|S|p\u2032 l3\u2032 s\u20323 \u00f1\u2032 i = N (M, W )\u03b4 3 (p \u2212 p\u2032 )\u03b4(W \u2212 W \u2032 )\u03b4ll\u2032 \u03b4l3 l\u20323 \u03b4ss\u2032 \u03b4s3 s\u20323 e2i\u03b4(W )ls .\n\n(15)\n\nIf the in-state is sharply peaked around a particular total energy W , and only one orbital angular momentum partial wave contributes to the scattering appreciably (as in the low energy limit), then the spin-dependent part of\nthe interaction can be separated from the momentum-dependent part and the toy model above becomes a realistic\napproximation [7].\nHowever, this is only the simplest case. Many new phenomena and types of entanglement wait to be explored.\nThere are complications, namely working with continuous degrees of freedom, but recent progress with Gaussian\nstates makes these difficulties appear tractable.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author would like to thank the Dipartimento di Fisica at the Universit\u00e1 degli Studi di Trento, the U.S.-Italian\nFulbright Commission, and American University for the support they provided while he was on a Fulbright Junior\nLectureship in Trento.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n\nH.
