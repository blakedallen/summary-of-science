Molecular hydrogen ion (H+\n2 or HD ) vibrational\nspectroscopy has recently been proposed as a new tool for very accurate direct optical determination of the electron\nto proton mass ratio with an improved accuracy [4, 5, 6]. H+\n2 high resolution vibrational spectroscopy is feasible using\nDoppler free two-photon transitions in the 9.1-9.2 \u03bcm range (1087-1099 cm\u22121 ), corresponding to the 9R(34)-9R(52)\nCO2 laser emission lines. There is no close co\u0131\u0308ncidence between CO2 laser lines and H+\n2 two-photon lines. However,\nwe have shown that the recently developped quantum cascade laser sources (QCL) are suitable for H+\n2 spectroscopy.\nThe relative accuracy level of interest on the vibrational frequency determination for mass ratio metrology purposes is\n2.10\u221210 , that corresponds to 2. 10\u22127 cm\u22121 (6 kHz), hence the need for highly accurate molecular frequency references\nin the 9.1-9.2 \u03bcm range.\nRecently, the 9 \u03bcm band 12 C16 O2 absolute frequencies have been measured with an accuracy better than 1 kHz\nup to the 9R(36) line [7] using a CO2 saturated absorption stabilized CO2 laser. Because the 9 \u03bcm band is a hot\nband and because the molecular population dramatically decrease with the angular quantum number, CO2 saturated\nabsorption signal to noise ratio becomes too low for laser stabilisation purposes beyond the 9R(36) line. Among the\nlarge variety of molecules (SF6 , OsO4 , NH3 , CO2 , HCOOH) which are well known to provide frequency references\nfor the CO2 lasers, formic acid \u03bd6 band is the only one that presents intense lines in the 9.1-9.2 \u03bcm range [8]. As an\nexample, Fig. 1 shows the (v=0,L=2)\u2192(v=1,L=2) H+\n2 two-photon excitation spectrum and formic acid lines close\nto the 9R(42) CO2 emission line. Through the paper, CO2 and HCOOH denote the standard isotopes. At 300 K,\nHCOOH is in the trans conformation, the cis one representing only 0.1% of the molecules [9].\nLine frequency measurements in the HCOOH \u03bd6 band have been performed using Fourier transform, diode laser, CO2\nlaser, and laser-radiofrequency double resonance and microwave spectroscopy [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Among them, the\nmost accurate ones were obtained by CO2 laser spectroscopy with accuracies in the 50-250 kHz range [11] for a small\nnumber of lines. Recently, absolute line intensities of the \u03bd6 and \u03bd8 band have been determined accurately [9]. When\ncompared to theoretical models taking into account Coriolis coupling between \u03bd6 and \u03bd8 bands, those measurements\nlead to the determination of effective hamiltonian parameters and the prediction of HCOOH lines with an uncertainty\nof 10\u22126 cm\u22121 (30 kHz) [8]. Those predictions have recently been improved, the line strengh being corrected by a\nfactor 2 and the line frequency given with the same uncertainty.\nThe aim of this work is the measurement at the kHz accuracy level of molecular reference frequencies in quasi\ncoincidence with the 9R(36) to 9R(42) CO2 laser lines. We first describe the CO2 /HCOOH reference laser and the\nwidely tunable QCL we have implemented. We then describe the frequency measurements and give the absolute\nfrequencies of 23 HCOOH lines. Finally, we analyse the relative stability of two independant lasers locked to two\ndifferent HCOOH lines.\n\n\f2\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\ncm /(molec cm )\n\n1090,95\n1e-19\n\n1091,05\n\n1091\n4\n\n3\n\n12\n\n78\n\n1e-20\n1e-21\n56\n\n1e-22\n\n(a)\n\n9 10\n\n1e-23\n1e-24\n0,1\n\n(b)\nH2\n\n0,01\n\n9R(42) CO2 line\n\n+\n\n0,001\n1091\n\n1090,95\n\n1091,05\n\ncm\n\n-1\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Full lines : HCOOH lines of intensity larger than 10 \u221223 cm\u22121 /(molec cm\u22122 ) from HITRAN database [8]. Dotted\nlines : additional lines predicted by A. Perrin [16]. The labels indicate the presently measured lines of Table I. When operated\non the 9R(42) CO2 line, the CO2 /HCOOH reference laser is stabilized on line 4.(b) (v=0,L=2)\u2192(v=1,L=2) H+\n2 two-photon\ntransition spectrum in arbitrary units.\n\nII.\n\nTHE LASER SOURCES\n\nThe experimental setup consists in a HCOOH stabilised CO2 reference laser (see Fig. 2) and in a tunable QCL (see\nFig. 3).\nA.\n\nThe CO2 /HCOOH reference laser\n\nThe CO2 laser is a sealed-off low pressure (13 Torr) dual-discharge-arm 1m-long laser emitting in a single longitudinal\nmode. The laser cavity is made of a 90-95% efficiency diffraction grating in the Littrow configuration and of a high\nreflectivity mirror at 9.2\u03bcm. The main output of the laser is the zeroth order of the grating. Laser oscillation is\nobtained up to the 9R(48) emission line of CO2 at 9.142\u03bcm with more than 1W of optical power. The CO2 laser\nfrequency is stabilised onto a formic acid saturated absorption signal detected in transmission of a 1m long optical\ncavity of finesse 100 and beam waist 3.8 mm containing a low pressure HCOOH gaz (0.5-2 mTorr, 66-266 Pa). Both\nthe laser and the cavity mirrors are glued on piezoelectric transducers for sweeping and modulation purposes. The\ncavity resonance frequency is sligthly modulated (frequency: f1 =33 kHz, depth: \u223c1 kHz) and is locked to the laser\nfrequency using first harmonic phase sensitive detection at f1 of the transmitted intensity. The intracavity optical\npower is set at 400\u03bcW. The laser frequency is modulated (frequency f2 =5.67 kHz, depth 100-200 kHz). A third\nharmonic phase-sensitive detection at 3f2 gives the saturated absorption signal (see Fig. 4) with a high signal to noise\nratio of more than 1000 at 1s integration time. This signal is used to stabilise the CO2 laser with a loop bandwidth\nof 100Hz. In the case of the 9R(42) CO2 line, there is no coincidence with intense HCOOH lines, so the CO2 laser\nfrequency is up-shifted by 128 MHz using an acousto-optic modulator to reach a HCOOH line.\nB.\n\nThe QCL system\n\nThe QCL is a singlemode cw distributed feedback laser [17] operated in a liquid nitrogen cryostat. The threshold\ncurrent is 400 mA at 77 K, the maximum current is about 1 A with a 9 V polarisation voltage. It can deliver up\nto 160mW optical power and is tunable from 9.166 \u03bcm to 9.240 \u03bcm. The temperature and current tunabilities are\nrespectively 3 GHz/K and 150 MHz/mA. Because the QCL's emission spectrum is several MHz wide and exhibits a\njitter over tens of MHz, the free running QCL is not suitable for high resolution infrared spectroscopy. The spectral\n\n\f3\nfeatures of singlemode CO2 lasers are much better with a linewidth in the kHz range [18]. We have shown that\nthey can be written out on the QCL spectrum with a 300-1500 MHz tunable frequency offset using a fast phase-lock\nloop [19] with a bandwidth of 6 MHz. The tunability range has been extended to 2 GHz by applying a 3-5 V reverse\nbias to the HgCdZnTe room temperature detector that monitors the beat note between the CO2 laser and the QCL,\nresulting in a better detectivity. The 6 MHz loop bandwidth implies that the CO2 laser frequency modulation is also\nwritten out on the QCL frequency with the same depth. For HCOOH spectroscopy, the QCL beam is injected into\na second Fabry-Perot cavity similar to the first one (1.5 m long, finesse 100, beam waist 4.2 mm, intra-cavity optical\npower 400 \u03bcW, HCOOH pressure 0.5-2 mTorr). The cavity resonance frequency is modulated (frequency f'1 =50 kHz,\ndepth \u22481 kHz) and is locked to the QCL emission frequency.

The beatnote frequency is divided by 8 and phase compared to a RF synthesizer of frequency \u03b4.\nThe QCL is phase-locked to the reference laser with a tunable frequency offset 8\u03b4. Because the frequency modulation of the\nreference laser is transferred to the QCL by the fast phase-lock loop, the HCOOH saturated absorption line is phase sensitive\ndetected at the third harmonic f2 , see Fig. 2. PZT: piezo transducer, PLL : phase-lock loop.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have performed absolute (A) and relative (R) frequency measurements of HCOOH saturated absorption lines.\nThe results are given in Table I and are respectively labelled by A or R in the second column.\nA.\n\nAbsolute frequency mesurement\n\nFor the absolute measurements, the CO2 /HCOOH reference laser (Fig. 2) has been transported to LPL laboratory\nwhere a femtosecond frequency comb infrared frequency measurement facility is implemented [20]. We have measured\n\n\f4\nthe absolute frequency of 6 HCOOH lines in quasi coincidence with 9R(36) to 9R(42) CO2 laser lines for which no\naccurate molecular reference were known.\nThe HCOOH/CO2 reference laser frequency is measured by comparison with a very high-harmonic of the repetition\nrate of a femto-second (fs) laser [20]. In the frequency domain, the fs laser provides a comb of modes separated by\nthe repetition rate [21]. A second comb is produced by a sum-frequency generation (SFG) of the fs laser comb and\nthe CO2 laser in a nonlinear crystal. This results in a beat between the low frequency part of the SFG comb and\nthe high frequency part of the initial comb. The infrared frequency is thus compared to the difference between two\nmodes of the comb. The beatnote is finally used to phase-lock the repetition rate to the CO2 laser frequency. This\nscheme is independent of the comb offset and does not require any broadening of the comb. To complete the frequency\nmeasurement procedure, the repetition rate (about 1 GHz) is detected with a fast photodiode and counted against\na local oscillator at 1 GHz. This local oscillator is phase-locked to a reference signal transmitted via a 43-km long\noptical fiber from the LNE-SYRTE laboratory, located in Paris [22]. This laboratory has developed a high stability\noscillator, which is based on a combination of a cryogenic Sapphire oscillator (CSO), an H-Maser and a set of low\nnoise microwave synthesizers [23]. Its frequency is steered by the H-Maser in the long-term, and monitored by the\nCs atomic fountain for accuracy [24]. This signal shows a frequency stability slightly below 10\u221214 \u03c4 \u22121 in the range\n1-10 s, and 10\u221215 from 10 to 105 s. The transfer through the optical link degrades this stability by less than one order\nof magnitude, while the phase noise introduced by the link can be efficiently suppressed with an active correction.\nFinally the resolution of the whole measurement chain is better than 0.3 Hz (10\u221214 in relative value) and will definitely\nnot be a limitation for the present measurements.\nThe day to day repetability of the measurements is 100 Hz for controlled experimental conditions. No significant\nfrequency shifts are observed by varying the intracavity optical power between 400\u03bcW and 2mW, varying the laser\nmodulation depth by more than a factor eight and introducing significant but small error signal offsets. We have\nobserved a positive pressure shift smaller than 2 kHz by varying the HCOOH pressure up to 4 mTorr. At the 0.5 mTorr\nlevel, formic acid pressure cannot be precisely controlled in our setup, probably because of adsorption effects on the\nvacuum chamber walls. We therefore give a conservative uncertainty of 1 kHz or 3.3 10\u22128 cm\u22121 on the absolute\nfrequency measurements.\nB.\n\nHCOOH spectroscopy\n\nWe have measured the HCOOH lines that are red or blue detuned by 300-1600 MHz with respect to the closest\nCO2 /HCOOH reference laser line using the widely tunable phase-locked QCL. The QCL frequency is swept by 1.6 kHz\nincrements and the saturated absorption profile is recorded and fitted by the third derivative of a lorentzian shape to\ndetermine the line center and width (see Fig 4). We are easily able to detect lines with a signal to noise ratio between 3\nand 1000 in a 1s integration time, the former corresponding to normalized intensities down to 1.6 10\u221222 cm\u22121 /(molec\ncm\u22122 ), (taking into account the recent corrections of the line intensities by a factor of two [9]). With optimized\nintracavity power and gaz pressure, the sensitivity of the spectrometer is low enough to detect the CO2 9R(42)\nsaturated absorption line that have a 5. 10\u221224 cm\u22121 /(molec cm\u22122 ) normalized intensity. Nevertheless, absolute\nHCOOH line intensities cannot be determined precisely from the line profile because of the large uncertainty on the\nactual pressure in the cavity.\nThe HCOOH fitted linewidths are between 160 and 220 kHz and are dominated by modulation broadening. Indeed,\nthe transit time broadening is 26 kHz, the pressure broadening is 0.32 cm\u22121 /atm [9] i.e. 12.8 kHz/mTorr and the\nnatural width and power broadening are negligible.\nThanks to the high signal to noise ratio of the lines, the fitted line centers are determined with uncertainties better\nthan 1 kHz. Nevertheless, taking into account the independant uncertainties on the reference line frequency (1 kHz),\nthe line position (1 kHz) and the HCOOH pressure determination (1 kHz), we give a conservative uncertainty of 2 kHz\nor 6.6 10\u22128 cm\u22121 on the HCCOH line frequency determined with the QCL spectrometer.\nC.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn Table I, the measured frequencies are compared to the HITRAN database predicted values [8], that are given\nwith a 10\u22126 cm\u22121 resolution. Our measurements agree with the HITRAN predictions at the 10\u22124 cm\u22121 level for\nmost of the lines excepted one for which a 8. 10\u22124 cm\u22121 (24 MHz) offset is observed. The agreement with recently\npredicted lines by A. Perrin [16] is better at the 2. 10\u22125 cm\u22121 level excepted for two lines. In the last column of the\nTable, the \u2217 labels predicted doublets.\nA few doublets predicted by A. Perrin [16] at 1089.040400, 1089.998920, 1090.055270 and 1091.066960 cm\u22121 have\nnot been observed in a frequency interval of \u00b1 8 MHz (2.6 10\u22124 cm\u22121 ) around the predicted values, with a sensitivity\n\n\f5\n\namplitude (a.u.)\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n1200\n\n1201\n\nfrequency offset (MHz)\n\nFIG. 4: Third harmonic phase sensitive saturated absorption signal of HCOOH line n\u25e6 3 of Table I versus the frequency offset\n8 \u03b4 between the reference laser and the phase locked QCL (see Fig. 3). The integration time is 1 s per point. Full line:\nadjustement by a third lorentzian derivative. The full width at half maximum is 220 kHz.\n\nof 10\u221222 cm\u22121 /(molec cm\u22122 ).\nIn Table II, we compare the present frequency measurements with previously published ones. There is a good\nagreement with the measurements obtained by CO2 laser saturation spectroscopy and reported in [11], the accuracy\nbeing improved by at least one order of magnitude.\nD.\n\nReference frequency stability\n\nThe aim of this work is to realise a reliable and stable frequency reference to probe two-photon vibrational transitions\nin H+\n2 with a resolution of the order of 1 kHz. We have measured the relative frequency stability of two independant\nsystems. The first one is the CO2 /HCOOH reference laser stabilized on the HCOOH line n\u25e6 4 of Table I. The second\nsystem involves the QCL and a master CO2 laser similar to the first one. The QCL is phase locked to the CO2 laser\nwith a fixed frequency offset. The QCL beam probes HCOOH line n\u25e6 7 of Table I. The saturated absorption signal\nis used to lock the master CO2 laser frequency. To characterize the relative stability of the two laser systems, the\nbeatnote frequency is counted with 1 s gate time. The Allan deviation shown in Fig. 5 exhibits a white frequency\nnoise behaviour of 146 Hz \u03c4 \u22121/2 , that is 4.5 10\u221212 in relative value. The relative stability reaches the 10 Hz level for\n200 s integration time. Both lasers are locked using saturated absorption signal having similar signal to noise ratios\nso individual stabilities are expected to be comparable and of the order of 100 Hz \u03c4 \u22121/2 .\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have set up a CO2 /HCOOH reference laser that can be operated from the 9R(36) to 9R(42) line and measured\nthe absolute frequency of 6 saturated absorption lines with an accuracy of 1 kHz (3.3 10\u22128 cm\u22121 ) improved by two\norders of magnitude as compared to previously reported results or predictions. Using a quantum cascade laser phase\n(QCL) locked to a master CO2 laser, we have determined the frequency of 17 additional formic acid lines with an\naccuracy of 2 kHz. The frequency stability of both the reference laser and the phase locked QCL are characterized by\na relative Allan deviation of 3.1 10\u221212 \u03c4 \u22121/2 . This performance demonstrates that the CO2 /HCOOH phase locked\nQCL is a suitable tool for H+\n2 high resolution spectroscopy at the kHz level.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank O. Acef, G.
