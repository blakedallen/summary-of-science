ORTIZ\nAbstract. A hyperbolic 3-simplex reflection group is a Coxeter group arising\nas a lattice in O + (3, 1), with fundamental domain a geodesic simplex in H3\n(possibly with some ideal vertices). The classification of these groups is known,\nand there are exactly 9 cocompact examples, and 23 non-cocompact examples.\nWe provide a complete computation of the lower algebraic K-theory of the\nintegral group ring of all the hyperbolic 3-simplex reflection groups.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper, we proceed to give a complete computation of the lower algebraic\nK-theory of the integral group ring of all the hyperbolic 3-simplex reflection groups.\nWe now proceed to outline the main steps of our approach. Since the groups \u0393 we\nare considering are lattices inside O+ (3, 1), fundamental results of Farrell and Jones\n[FJ93] imply that the lower algebraic K-theory of the integral group ring Z \u0393 can\nbe computed by calculating Hn\u0393 (EVC (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e ), a specific generalized equivariant\nhomology theory for a model for the classifying space EVC (\u0393) of \u0393 with isotropy in\nthe family VC of virtually cyclic subgroups of \u0393.\nAfter introducing the groups we are interested in (see Section 2), we then combine results from our previous paper [LO] with a recent construction of L\u00fcck and\nWeiermann [LW] to obtain the following explicit formula for the homology group\nabove:\nk\nM\n\u0393\n\u2212\u221e\nHnVi (EF IN (Vi ) \u2192 \u2217).\nH\n(E\n(\u0393);\nKZ\n)\n\u2295\nKn (Z \u0393) \u223c\n= n F IN\ni=1\n\nIn the formula above, EF IN (\u0393) is a model for the classifying space for proper\nactions, the collection {Vi }ki=1 are a finite collection of virtually cyclic subgroups\nwith specific geometric properties, and HnVi (EF IN (Vi ) \u2192 \u2217) are cokernels of certain\nrelative assembly maps. This explicit formula is obtained in Section 3.\nIn view of this explicit formula, our computation reduces to being able to:\n(1) identify for each of our groups the corresponding collection {Vi } of virtually\ncyclic subgroups (done in Section 4),\n(2) be able to calculate the cokernels of the corresponding relative assembly\nmaps (done in Section 6), and\n(3) calculate the homology groups Hn\u0393 (EF IN (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e ).\nFor the computation of the homology groups, we note that Quinn [Qu82] has developed a spectral sequence for computing the groups Hn\u0393 (EF IN (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e ). The\nE 2 -terms in the spectral sequence can be computed in terms of the lower algebraic K-theory of the stabilizers of cells in a CW -model for the classifying space\nEF IN (\u0393).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJEAN-FRAN\u00c7OIS LAFONT AND IVONNE J. ORTIZ\n\nIn Section 5, we proceed to give, for each of the finite subgroups appearing as\na cell stabilizer, a computation of the lower algebraic K-theory. We return to the\nspectral sequence computation in Section 7, where we analyze some of the maps\nappearing in the computation of the E 2 -terms for the Quinn spectral sequence. In\nall 32 cases, the spectral sequence collapses at the E 2 stage, allowing us to complete\nthe computations. The reader who is merely interested in knowing the results of\nthe computations is invited to consult Table 6 (for the uniform lattices) and Table\n7 (for the non-uniform lattices). Finally, in the Appendix, we provide a \"walk\nthrough\" of the computations for two of the 32 groups we consider.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Tom Farrell, Ian Leary, and Marco Varisco for\nmany helpful comments on this project. The graphics in this paper were kindly\nproduced by Dennis Burke. The authors are particularly grateful to Bruce Magurn\nfor his extensive help with the computations of the algebraic K-theory of finite\ngroups appearing in Section 5 of this paper.\nThe first author's work on this project was partially supported by NSF grant\nDMS - 0606002.\n2. The Three-dimensional groups\nA hyperbolic Coxeter n-simplex \u2206n is an n-dimensional geodesic simplex in Hn ,\nall of whose dihedral angles are submultiples of \u03c0 or zero. We allow a simplex in\nHn to be unbounded with ideal vertices on the sphere at infinity of Hn . It is known\nthat such simplices exist only in dimensions n = 2, 3, . . . , 9, and that for n \u2265 3,\nthere are exactly 72 hyperbolic Coxeter simplices up to congruence, see [JKRT99]\nand [JKRT02].\nA hyperbolic Coxeter n-simplex reflection group \u0393 is the group generated by\nreflections in the sides of a Coxeter n-simplex in hyperbolic n-space Hn . We will\ncall such group a hyperbolic n-simplex group.\nAccording to Vinberg [V67], the associated hyperbolic n-simplex groups of all\nbut eight of the 72 simplices are arithmetic. The nonarithmetic groups are the hyperbolic Coxeter tetrahedra groups [(3, 4, 3, 5)] [5, 3, 6]. [5, 3[3] ], [(33 , 6)], [(3, 4, 3, 6)],\n[(3, 5, 3, 6)], and the 5-dimensional hyperbolic Coxeter group [(35 , 4)].\nIn dimension three, there are 32 hyperbolic Coxeter tetrahedra groups. Nine of\nthem are cocompact, see Figure 1, and 23 are noncocompact, see Figure 2. Let\nus briefly recall how the algebra and geometry of these groups are encoded in the\nCoxeter diagrams.\nFrom the algebraic viewpoint, the Coxeter diagram encodes a presentation of\nthe associated group \u0393 as follows: associate a generator xi to each vertex vi of the\nCoxeter diagram (hence all of our groups will come equipped with four generators,\nas the Coxeter diagrams have four vertices). For the relations in \u0393, one has:\n(1) for every vertex vi , one inserts the relation x2i = 1\n(2) if two vertices vi , vj are not joined by an edge, one inserts the relation\n(xi xj )2 = 1 (so combined with the previous relation, one sees that xi and\nxj commute, generating a Z /2 \u00d7 Z /2),\n\n\fLOWER ALGEBRAIC K-THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC 3-SIMPLEX REFLECTION GROUPS. 3\n\n(3) if two vertices vi , vj are joined by an unlabelled edge, one inserts the relation\n(xi xj )3 = 1 (and in particular, the two elements xi , xj generate a subgroup\nisomorphic to the dihedral group D3 ),\n(4) if two vertices vi , vj are joined by an edge with label mij , one inserts the relation (xi xj )m\nij = 1 (and hence, the two elements xi , xj generate a subgroup\nisomorphic to the dihedral group Dmij ).\nA special subgroup of \u0393 will be a subgroup generated by a subset of the generating\nset. Observe that such a subgroup will automatically be a Coxeter group, with a\npresentation that can again be read off from the Coxeter diagram. Special subgroups generated by a pair of generators will always be isomorphic to a (finite)\ndihedral group. An important point for our purposes is that in our Coxeter groups,\nevery finite subgroup can be conjugated into a finite special subgroup. In particular,\nsince there are only finitely many special subgroups, one can quite easily classify up\nto isomorphism all the finite subgroups appearing in any of our 32 Coxeter groups.\nNow let us move to the geometric viewpoint. As we mentioned earlier, associated\nto any of our 32 Coxeter groups, one has a simplex \u22063 in hyperbolic 3-space H3 .\nEach of the four generators xi of the Coxeter group \u0393 is bijectively associated with\nthe hyperplane Pi extending one of the four faces of the simplex \u22063 , and the angles\nbetween the respective hyperplanes can again be read off from the Coxeter diagram:\n(1) if two vertices vi , vj are not joined by an edge, then \u2220(Pi , Pj ) = \u03c0/2\n(2) if two vertices vi , vj are joined by an unlabelled edge, then \u2220(Pi , Pj ) = \u03c0/3\n(3) if two vertices vi , vj are joined by an edge with label mij , then \u2220(Pi , Pj ) =\n\u03c0/mij .\nThe resulting configuration of four hyperplanes exists, and is unique up to isometries\nof H 3 . One can now define the map \u0393 \u2192 O+ (3, 1) = Isom(H3 ) by sending each\ngenerator xi to the isometry obtained by reflecting in the corresponding hyperplane\nPi . The condition on the angles between the hyperplanes ensures that this map\nrespects the relations in \u0393, and hence is actually a homomorphism. In fact this\nmap is an embedding of \u0393 as a discrete subgroup of O+ (3, 1), with fundamental\ndomain for the associated action on H3 consisting precisely of the simplex \u22063 .\nFinally, to relate the geometric with the algebraic viewpoint, we remind the\nreader of the following bijective identifications:\n(1) given an edge in the 3-simplex \u22063 , lying on the intersection of two hyperplanes Pi , Pj , the subgroup of \u0393 that fixes the edge pointwise is precisely\nthe special subgroup hxi , xj i (and hence will be a dihedral group).\n(2) given a vertex in the 3-simplex \u22063 , obtained as the intersection of three hyperplanes Pi , Pj , Pk , the subgroup of \u0393 that stabilizes the vertex is precisely\nthe special subgroup hxi , xj , xk i.\nWe point out that the stabilizer of a vertex of \u22063 will either be a finite Coxeter\ngroup (if the vertex lies inside H3 ), or will be a 2-dimensional crystallographic group\n(if the vertex is an ideal vertex). Furthermore, one can readily determine whether\na vertex will be ideal or not, just by determining whether the associated special\nsubgroup is crystallographic or finite.\nIt is known that for all the groups listed above the Farrell and Jones Isomorphism Conjecture in lower algebraic K-theory holds, that is Hn\u0393 (EVC (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e ) \u223c\n=\n\n\f4\n\nJEAN-FRAN\u00c7OIS LAFONT AND IVONNE J.

Cocompact hyperbolic Coxeter tetrahedral groups\n\n3. A formula for the algebraic K-theory.\nIn this section, we combine some recent work of L\u00fcck and Weiermann [LW] with\nsome previous work of the authors [LO] to establish the following:\nProposition 3.1.

Note that by the second property above, the \u0393-action\nby conjugation on Fe \u2212 F preserves equivalence classes, and hence descends to a \u0393action on [Fe \u2212 F ]. We let I be a complete set of representatives [G] of the \u0393-orbits\nin [Fe \u2212 F ]. Finally, we define for G \u2208 Fe \u2212 F the subgroup:\nN\u0393 [G] := {g \u2208 \u0393 | [gGg \u22121 ] = [G]}\n\nwhich is precisely the isotropy group of [G] \u2208 [Fe \u2212 F] under the \u0393-action induced\nby conjugation. Finally, define a family of subgroups Fe[G] of the group N\u0393 [G] by:\ne\nF[G]\n:= {K \u2282 N\u0393 [G] | K \u2208 Fe \u2212 F , [K] = [G]} \u222a {K \u2282 N\u0393 [G] | K \u2208 F }\n\nObserve that the notions defined above (introduced in [LW]) make sense for any\nequivalence relation on Fe \u2212 F satisfying the two properties above.\nNow [LW, Theorem 2.3] states that for any equivalence relation \u223c on the elements in Fe \u2212 F satisfying the two properties above (and with the notation used in\nthe previous paragraph), the \u0393-CW-complex X defined by the cellular \u0393-pushout\ndepicted below is a model for EFe (\u0393).\n`\n\n[H]\u2208I\n\n\u0393 \u00d7N\u0393 [H] EF \u2229N\u0393 [H] (N\u0393 [H])\n\n\u03b2\n\n/ EF (\u0393)\n\n\u03b1\n\n`\n\n[H]\u2208I\n\n\u000f\n\u0393 \u00d7N\u0393 [H] EF[H]\n(N\u0393 [H])\ne\n\n\u000f\n/X\n\nIn the above cellular \u0393-pushout, L\u00fcck-Weiermann require either (1) \u03b1 is the disjoint union of cellular N\u0393 [H]-maps ([H] \u2208 I), \u03b2 is an inclusion of \u0393-CW-complexes,\nor (2) \u03b1 is the disjoint union of inclusions of N\u0393 [H]-CW-complexes ([H] \u2208 I), \u03b2 is\na cellular \u0393-map.\nWe now proceed to verify that, for the equivalence relation we have defined using\nthe adapted family {H\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I , the left hand terms in the cellular \u0393-pushout given\nabove reduce to precisely the left hand terms appearing in the statement of our\nproposition. This boils down to two claims:\nClaim 1: For any G \u2208 Fe \u2212 F, we have the equality N\u0393 [G] = H where H is the\nunique element in {H\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I satisfying G \u2264 H.\n\nTo see this, we first note that there indeed is a unique H \u2208 {H\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I satisfying\nG \u2264 H, for if there were two such groups H1 6= H2 , then we would immediately\nsee that H1 \u2229 H2 \u2265 G \u2208 Fe \u2212 F, contradicting the property (1) of an adapted\ncollection. Next we observe that if h \u2208 H, then hGh\u22121 \u2264 hHh\u22121 = H, and\nhence that [hGh\u22121 ] = [G], which implies the containment H \u2264 N\u0393 [G]. Conversely,\nif k \u2208 N\u0393 [G], then we have that [G] = [kGk \u22121 ], and so from the definition of\nthe equivalence relation there must exist some H\u0304 \u2208 {H\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I with G \u2264 H\u0304 and\nkGk \u22121 \u2264 H\u0304. Since we already know that G \u2264 H, the uniqueness forces H\u0304 = H,\n\n\fLOWER ALGEBRAIC K-THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC 3-SIMPLEX REFLECTION GROUPS. 7\n\nand thus that kGk \u22121 \u2264 H. This in turn tells us that H \u2229k \u22121 Hk \u2265 G \u2208 Fe \u2212 F, and\nproperty (1) of an adapted collection now forces H = k \u22121 Hk, which implies that\nk \u2208 N\u0393 (H). But property (3) of an adapted collection forces the group H to be\nself-normalizing, giving k \u2208 H, and completing the proof of the reverse inclusion.\nClaim 2: For any G \u2208 Fe \u2212 F, the family Fe[G] on the group N\u0393 [G] = H (see\nthe previous Claim) coincides with the restriction Fe \u2229H of the family Fe to the\nsubgroup H (i.e. consisting of all elements in Fe that lie within H).\n\nNote that the containment Fe[G] \u2282 Fe \u2229H is obvious from the definition of Fe[G].\nFor the opposite containment, let K \u2208 Fe \u2229H \u2282 Fe, and observe that K \u2264 H and\neither K \u2208 F , or K \u2208 Fe \u2212 F. In the first case, we have K \u2208 F \u2229H \u2282 Fe[G], while in\nthe second case, we have that [K] = [G] by the definition of the equivalence relation,\nand hence again we have K \u2208 Fe[G]. This gives us the containment Fe \u2229H \u2282 Fe[G],\ngiving us the Claim.\nHaving established our two Claims, we can now substitute the expressions from\nthe Claims for the corresponding ones in the L\u00fcck-Weiermann diagram. Finally,\nwe comment on the indices in the disjoint sums appearing in the right hand of\nthe diagrams. In the expression of L\u00fcck-Weiermann, the disjoint sum is taken\nover I, a complete system of representatives [G] of the \u0393-orbits in [Fe \u2212 F]. But\nobserve that from the definition of the equivalence relation we are using, classes in\n[Fe \u2212 F ] can be bijectively identified with groups H \u2208 {H\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I (by associating each\nclass in [Fe \u2212 F ] with the unique element in {H\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I containing all the elements\nin the class). Since it is clear that the \u0393-action on [Fe \u2212 F] coincides (under the\nbijection above) with the \u0393-action on the set {H\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I , we can replace the system\nof representatives I by the system of representatives H. This completes the proof\nof the proposition.\n\u0003\nWe now specialize to the case where F = F IN and Fe = VC, and recall that\nBartels [Bar03] has established that for any group \u0393, the relative assembly map:\nH\u2217\u0393 (EF IN (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e ) \u2192 H\u2217\u0393 (EVC (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e )\n\nis split injective. We denote by H\u2217\u0393 (EF IN (\u0393) \u2192 EVC (\u0393)) the cokernel of the\nrelative assembly map. Now applying the induction structure on this equivariant\ngeneralized homology theory, an immediate consequence of the previous proposition\nis the following:\nCorollary 3.2. Given the group \u0393, assume that the collection of subgroups {H\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I\nis adapted to the pair (F IN , VC).

The\ngroups fall into three types, with infinitely many conjugacy classes of type II\nand type III, and only finitely many conjugacy classes of type I subgroups.\nFurthermore, the relative assembly map is an isomorphism (for n \u2264 1) for\nall groups of type II and III. This is discussed in more detail in Section 4.\n\u2022 Berkove, Farrell, Juan-Pineda, and Pearson [BFPP00] established that the\nFarrell-Jones isomorphism conjecture holds for all lattices \u0393 in hyperbolic\nspace (and k \u2264 1), and hence that one has isomorphisms:\nKn (Z \u0393) \u223c\n= Hn\u0393 (EVC (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e )\n\nfor all n \u2264 1.\nCombining these observations with the previous corollary yields the following:\nCorollary 3.4. Let \u0393 \u2264 O+ (3, 1) be any Coxeter group arising as a lattice (uniform\nor non-uniform), and let {Vi }ki=1 be a complete set of representatives for conjugacy\n\n\fLOWER ALGEBRAIC K-THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC 3-SIMPLEX REFLECTION GROUPS. 9\n\nclasses of type I maximal virtually infinite cyclic subgroups of \u0393.

Maximal infinite VC \u221e subgroups.\nIn this section, we proceed to classify the maximal infinite virtually cyclic (VC \u221e )\nsubgroups arising in our groups. Let us start by briefly recalling some of the results\nfrom Section 3 of [LO]. First of all, for a lattice \u0393 in O+ (n, 1), infinite VC subgroups\nare of two types: those that fix a single point in the boundary at infinity, and\nthose that fix a pair of points in the boundary at infinity. We call subgroups\nof the first type parabolic, and those of second type hyperbolic. Note that every\nparabolic subgroup can be conjugated into a cusp group; for the purpose of our\nclassification, we will ignore these subgroups. The subgroups of hyperbolic type\nautomatically stabilize the geodesic joining the pair of fixed points in the boundary\nat infinity. Furthermore the geodesic they stabilize will project to a periodic curve\nin the quotient space Hn / \u0393. Note that conversely, stabilizers of periodic geodesics\nare infinite VC subgroups of \u0393. This implies that the maximal hyperbolic type\ninfinite VC subgroups of \u0393 are in bijective correspondence with stabilizers of periodic\ngeodesics.\nWe now specialize to the case where n = 3, and \u0393 is a Coxeter group. In this\nsituation, we can subdivide the family of periodic geodesics into three types:\n\u2022 a geodesic whose projection has non-trivial intersection with the interior of\nthe polyhedron H3 / \u0393, which we call type III.\n\u2022 a geodesic whose projection lies in the boundary of the polyhedron H3 / \u0393,\nbut does not lie inside the 1-skeleton of H3 / \u0393, which we call type II.\n\u2022 a geodesic whose projection lies in the 1-skeleton of the polyhedron H3 / \u0393,\nwhich we call type I.\nFor geodesics of type III, it is easy to see that the stabilizer of the geodesic must\nbe isomorphic to either Z or D\u221e . For geodesics of type II, the stabilizer is always\nisomorphic to either Z2 \u00d7 Z or Z2 \u00d7D\u221e . The main purpose of this section will be\nto classify stabilizers of type I geodesics for all 32 groups which occur as hyperbolic\n3-simplex reflection groups.\nWe start by outlining our approach: all the groups we are considering have\nfundamental domain consisting of a 3-dimensional simplex in H3 (possibly with\nsome ideal vertices). So up to conjugacy, for each of the groups we are considering,\nwe can have at most six distinct stabilizers of type I geodesic (one for each edge in\nthe fundamental domain, fewer in the presence of ideal vertices). But this is actually\nan overcount, as one could potentially have a type I geodesic whose projection into\nthe fundamental domain passes through several of the edges. So the first step is to\nunderstand how many distinct stabilizers (up to conjugacy) one obtains.\nLet us explain how one can find out the number of distinct stabilizers. Note\nthat, at every (non-ideal) vertex v of our fundamental domain 3-simplex in H3 ,\nwe can consider a small \u01eb-sphere Sv centered at v. Now the tessellation of H3 by\n\n\f10\n\nJEAN-FRAN\u00c7OIS LAFONT AND IVONNE J. ORTIZ\n\ncopies of the fundamental domain induces a tessellation of Sv by isometric spherical\ntriangles. In fact, the tessellation of Sv is the one naturally associated with the\nspecial subgroup of the Coxeter group \u0393 that stabilizes the vertex v. Now note\nthat, if we were to label the three edges of the 3-simplex incident to v, we get a\ncorresponding label of the three vertices of a spherical triangle in the tessellation\nof Sv . One can extend this labeling via reflections, both for the tessellation of H3\nand the tessellation of Sv .\nNow given a periodic geodesic of type I, with a portion of the geodesic projecting\nto the edge e in the 3-simplex, with e adjacent to the vertex v, one can easily \"read\noff\" from the labeled tessellation of Sv which edge extends the geodesic. Indeed,\nthis will be picked up by the label of the vertex in the tessellation of Sv which is\nantipodal to the labeled vertex corresponding to e. In this manner, one can easily\ndecide the number of distinct stabilizers of type I geodesics that arise for the 32\ngroups we are considering.\nTo recognize the tessellations arising for the various Sv , one now notes that the\nisometry group of each of these tessellations can be obtained by looking at the\nstabilizer \u0393v of the vertex v in the group \u0393. These stabilizers are finite special subgroups, of the Coxeter group \u0393, generated by three of the four canonical generators\nof \u0393. From the classification of the 32 hyperbolic 3-simplex groups, it is easy to list\nout all the finite parabolic subgroups we need to consider: there are eight of these,\nnamely Z2 \u00d7D2 , Z2 \u00d7D3 , Z2 \u00d7D4 , Z2 \u00d7D5 , Z2 \u00d7D6 , [3, 3] \u223c\n= Z2 \u00d7S4 ,\n= S4 , [3, 4] \u223c\n\u223c\nand [3, 5] = Z2 \u00d7A5 .\nThe next step is to identify the stabilizers of the corresponding geodesics. In the\nsituation we are considering, all the type I geodesics \u03b7 that appear have stabilizer\nStab\u0393 (\u03b7) acting with fundamental domain an interval. In fact, the interval can be\nidentified with the quotient space \u03b7/ Stab\u0393 (\u03b7) \u2282 H3 / \u0393, which will be a union of\nedges in the 1-skeleton of the 3-simplex H3 / \u0393. Hence the group Stab\u0393 (\u03b7) can be\nidentified using Bass-Serre theory: it will be the fundamental group of a graph of\ngroup, where the graph of group consists of a single edge joining two vertices, with\nedge/vertex groups which can be explicitly found from the tessellations. We will\nsay that the geodesic (or sometimes the edge in the 1-skeleton) reflects at the two\nendpoint vertices.\nIndeed, the edge group Ge will be precisely the stabilizer of one of the edges in\n\u03b7/ Stab\u0393 (\u03b7) \u2282 H3 / \u0393. On the other hand, the vertex groups Gv , Gw can be found\nby looking at each of the two endpoint vertices v, w for \u03b7/ Stab\u0393 (\u03b7), and studying\nthe spherical tessellations of Sv , Sw . Note that we are trying to identify elements in\n\u0393, which stabilize the vertex v (respectively w), and additionally map the geodesic\n\u03b7 through v to itself. In particular, it must map the pair of antipodal vertices \u03b7 \u00b1\n(corresponding to the incoming/outgoing \u03b7-directions) in the tessellation of Sv to\nthemselves. The subgroup Ge \u2282 Gv can be identified with the index 2 subgroup\nconsisting of elements Gv which fix both of the points \u03b7 \u00b1 . Now there is an obvious\nmap which permutes the two points \u03b7 + and \u03b7 \u2212 : namely the reflection in the equator\nequidistant from these two points. But it is not clear that this reflection preserves\nthe tessellation of Sv ; in some cases, one will need to reflect in the equator, and\nthen rotate by a certain angle along the \u03b7 \u00b1 axis, in order to obtain an element in\n\u0393v . Note that if the reflection in the equator preserves the tessellation, then we\nimmediately obtain that Gv \u223c\n= Ge \u00d7 Z2 . If the reflection in the equator does not\npreserve the tessellation, then we obtain that Gv \u223c\n= Ge \u22ca Z2 . One can perform\n\n\fLOWER ALGEBRAIC K-THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC 3-SIMPLEX REFLECTION GROUPS. 11\n\nthe same analysis at the vertex w, and hence find an expression for Stab\u0393 (\u03b7) as an\namalgamation of the groups Gv , Gw over the index 2 subgroups Ge .\nWe make two observations: first of all, the stabilizer of an edge will always\nbe a special subgroup of \u0393, generated by a pair of canonical generators in \u0393. In\nparticular, the group Ge will always be a dihedral group Dk for some k. Now the\nvertex groups are of two types: (1) if the reflection in the equator preserves the\ntessellation, we obtain Gv \u223c\n= Z2 \u00d7Dk , or (2) if the reflection in the equator does not\npreserve the tessellation, then one can explicitly read off the semi-direct product\nstructure from the tessellation, and in fact it is easy to see that Gv \u223c\n= D2k . In\nthe table below, we list out, for each of the finite parabolic subgroups we need to\nconsider, the edges that reflect, as well as the corresponding Gv . Let us explain\nthe notation used in the table: the first column gives the various finite parabolic\nsubgroups that occur, the second column lists the angles that appear in the spherical\ntriangles of the corresponding tessellation of Sv . The remaining three columns are\nordered from smallest angle to largest, and expresses whether (1) the corresponding\nedge extends (i.e. does not reflect) at v, and (2) if it reflects, the corresponding\nsubgroup Gv .\nZ2 \u00d7D2\n\n\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2, \u03c0/2 Z2 \u00d7D2\n\nZ2 \u00d7D2\n\nZ2 \u00d7D2\n\nZ2 \u00d7D3\n\n\u03c0/3, \u03c0/2, \u03c0/2 Z2 \u00d7D3\n\nextends\n\nextends\n\nZ2 \u00d7D4\n\n\u03c0/4, \u03c0/2, \u03c0/2 Z2 \u00d7D4\n\nextends\n\nextends\n\nZ2 \u00d7D5\n\n\u03c0/5, \u03c0/2, \u03c0/2 Z2 \u00d7D5\n\nextends\n\nextends\n\nZ2 \u00d7D6\n\n\u03c0/6, \u03c0/2, \u03c0/2 Z2 \u00d7D6\n\nextends\n\nextends\n\nS4\n\n\u03c0/3, \u03c0/3, \u03c0/2 extends\n\nextends\n\nD4\n\nZ2 \u00d7S4\n\n\u03c0/4, \u03c0/3, \u03c0/2 Z2 \u00d7D4\n\nD6\n\nZ2 \u00d7D2\n\nZ2 \u00d7A5\n\n\u03c0/5, \u03c0/3, \u03c0/2\n\nD6\n\nZ2 \u00d7D2\n\nD10\n\nTable 1: Finite parabolic subgroups & local behavior of edges.\nFrom the Coxeter diagrams of the 32 groups we are considering, we can now\nread off quite easily the number (up to conjugacy) of stabilizers of type I geodesics.\nWe now proceed to summarize the results of this procedure, which we list out in\nTables 2, 3, and 4. We remind the reader that, in addition to these subgroups, there\nwill also be (up to conjugacy) countably infinitely many maximal VC subgroup of\nhyperbolic type isomorphic to one of Z, D\u221e , Z2 \u00d7 Z, Z2 \u00d7D\u221e (coming from stabilizers of type II and type III geodesics).

Then the following sequence\nis exact:\nM\nM\nK0 (Q\u0302p G) \u2192 K\u22121 (ZG) \u2192 0.\nK0 (\u1e90p G) \u2192\n0 \u2192 K0 (Z) \u2192 K0 (QG) \u2295\np|n\n\np|n\n\nThe group algebra Q[D6 \u00d7 Z/2] is isomorphic to Q8 \u00d7 (M2 (Q))4 and the same\nstatement is true if Q is replaced by Q\u03022 and Q\u03023 .

The integral p-adic terms are\nK0 (\u1e902 [D6 \u00d7 Z/2]) \u223c\n= K0 (F2 [D6 \u00d7 Z/2] \u223c\n= K0 (F2 [D6 ]) \u223c\n= Z2 , (see [Or04, page 350]),\nand K0 (\u1e903 [D6 \u00d7 Z/2]) \u223c\n= K0 (F3 [D6 \u00d7 Z/2]) \u223c\n= K0 (F3 [(Z/2)3 ]) \u223c\n= Z8 . Carter also\nshows in [C80a] that K\u22121 (Z[D6 \u00d7 Z/2]) is torsion free, so counting ranks in the\nexact sequence, we have that K\u22121 (Z[D6 \u00d7 Z/2]) \u223c\n= Z3 .\nTo compute K\u03030 (Z[D6 \u00d7 Z/2]), consider the following Cartesian square\nZ[Z/2][D6 ]\n\n/ Z[D6 ]\n\n\u000f\nZ[D6 ]\n\n\u000f\n/ F2 [D6 ]\n\nwhich yields the Mayer-Vietories sequence (see [CuR87, Theorem 49.27])\n(1)\n\u03c6\n\nK1 (Z[D6 \u00d7 Z/2]) \u2192 K1 (ZD6 ) \u2295 K1 (ZD6 ) \u2212\n\u2192 K1 (F2 [D6 ]) \u2192\n\n\u2192 K\u03030 (Z[Z/2][D6 ]) \u2192 K\u03030 (ZD6 ) \u2295 K\u03030 (ZD6 ) \u2192 0\n\nWe now proceed to compute the various terms appearing in this sequence.\nWe start by looking at the terms involving ZD6 . In [Re76] Reiner shows that\nK\u03030 (ZD6 ) is trivial. K1 (ZD6 ) can be computed as follows: since W h(G) equals\nK1 (ZG)/{\u00b1Gab }, the rank of K1 (ZG) is equal to the rank of W h(G). But the\nrank of W h(G) is y = r \u2212 q, where r denotes the number of irreducible real representations of G, and q denotes the number of irreducible rational representations\nof G. In [Bas65] Bass shows that r is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of\nsets {x, x\u22121 }, x \u2208 G and q is the number of conjugacy classes of cyclic subgroups\nof G (see also [Mi66]). For G = D6 , a direct calculations shows that r = q, and\nhence that W h(G) is purely torsion. Next note that the torsion part of K1 (ZG) is\n{\u00b11}\u2295Gab \u2295SK1 (ZG) (see [W74]), and hence we have that W h(D6 ) = SK1 (ZD6 ).\nSince Magurn [Ma78] has shown that SK1 (ZG) is trivial, we see that W h(D6 ) is\ntrivial. Since (D6 )ab = (Z/2)2 , we obtain that K1 (Z[D6 ]) = (Z/2)3 .\nNext we consider the remaining terms in the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. For G =\nD6 \u00d7Z/2, Magurn in [Ma80, Corollary 11] shows that W h(D6 \u00d7Z/2) = 0 (note that\nthe rank of W h(G \u00d7 Z/2) is twice the rank of W h(G) since r and q get doubled, see\nSection 5.2 and 5.3). Since (D6 \u00d7 Z/2)ab = (Z/2)3 , this yields K1 (Z[D6 \u00d7 Z/2]) =\n(Z/2)4 . Finally, Magurn in [Ma06, Example 9]) shows that K1 (F2 [D6 ]) = (Z/2)4 .\nSubstituting all the known terms into the exact sequence in (1) yields the following\nexact sequence:\n(2)\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u2192 (Z/2)4 \u2192 K\u03030 (Z[Z/2][D6 ]) \u2192 0.\n\u2192 (Z/2)3 \u2295 (Z/2)3 \u2212\n(Z/2)4 \u2212\n\nNext, we study the image of \u03c6 : K1 (ZD6 ) \u2295 K1 (ZD6 ) \u2192 K1 (F2 [D6 ]). We claim\nthat im(\u03c6) = (Z/2)2 . This can be seen as follows: first im(\u03c6) = im(\u03c8) where\n\u03c8 : K1 (ZD6 ) \u2212\u2192 K1 (F2 [D6 ]) is induced by the canonical ring homomorphism\nZ \u2192 F2 . Note the K1 (Z) is a direct summand of K1 (ZD6 ) and isomorphic to Z/2 ;\nbut this summand goes to zero in K1 (F2 [D6 ]) since it factors through the following\n\n\f16\n\nJEAN-FRAN\u00c7OIS LAFONT AND IVONNE J.

Now from the exact\nsequences given in (1) and (2), we have that:\ndimF2 (im(\u03c6)) = 2 dimF2 (K1 (Z[D6 ])) \u2212 dimF2 (ker(\u03c6)) = 6 \u2212 dimF2 (im(\u03c3)).\n\nSince dimF2 (im(\u03c3)) \u2264 4, we see that dimF2 (im(\u03c6)) \u2265 2, which forces im(\u03c6) \u223c\n=\n(Z/2)2 . The exact sequence now yields K\u03030 (Z[Z/2][D6 ]) \u223c\n= (Z/2)2 .\n5.2. The computation of the K-groups K\u22121 (ZD5 ), and W h(D5 ).

For p = 5, the group algebra Q\u03025 D5 \u223c\nQ is replaced by Q\u03022 (recall that 5 \u2208\n=\n2\n(Q\u03025 ) \u00d7 M2 (Q\u03025 ). Hence K0 (Q\u03022 [D5 ]) \u223c\n= K0 (Q[D5 ]) \u223c\n= Z2 , and K0 (Q\u03025 [D5 ]) \u223c\n= Z3 .\nUsing techniques described in [CuR81, Section 5], we have that K0 (\u1e905 [D5 ]) \u223c\n=\nK0 (F5 [D5 ]) \u223c\n=\n= K0 (F2 [D5 ]) \u223c\n= K0 (F5 [Z/2]) = K0 (F5 \u00d7 F5 ) = Z2 . Also K0 (\u1e902 [D5 ]) \u223c\nK0 (F2 \u00d7 M2 (F2 )) = Z2 . Carter also shows in [C80a] that K\u22121 (Z[D5 ]) is torsion\nfree, so counting ranks as before, we have that K\u22121 (ZD5 ) \u223c\n= 0.\nNext, we compute W h(D5 ). Recall that W h(G) = Zy \u2295 SK1 (ZG). Magurn\nin [Ma78] proves that SK1 vanishes for all finite dihedral groups. The rank of the\ntorsion free part is y = r\u2212q (see Section 5.1). Since in D5 = hr, s | r5 = s2 = 1, srs =\nr\u22121 i, there are three cyclic subgroups modulo conjugacy (the trivial subgroup {e},\nC2 and C5 ) and four conjugacy classes of sets {x, x\u22121 } (consisting of {e}, {r, r4 },\n{r2 , r3 } and {s, s}), we see that r = 4 and q = 3.

To calculate K\u22121 (ZD10 ), again\nusing Carter's formula for K\u22121 [C80b, Theorem 3], we have (see Section 5.1 and\n5.2):\nM\nM\nK0 (Q\u0302p D10 ) \u2192 K\u22121 (ZD10 ) \u2192 0\nK0 (\u1e90p D10 ) \u2192\n0 \u2192 K0 (Z) \u2192 K0 (QD10 ) \u2295\np|n\n\np|n\n\nThe group algebra Q[D5 \u00d7 Z/2] is isomorphic to Q4 and the same statement is\ntrue if Q is replaced by Q\u03022 .

Hence K0 (Q[D5 \u00d7 Z/2]) \u223c\n= Z4 , and K0 (Q\u03025 [D5 \u00d7\n= K0 (Q\u03022 [D5 \u00d7 Z/2]) \u223c\n6\n\u223c\nZ/2]) = Z .

Magurn in [Ma78] proves that SK1 vanishes for\nall finite dihedral groups. For D10 = hr, s | r10 = s2 = 1, srs = r\u22121 i, we have four\ncyclic subgroups (modulo conjugacy) of D10 : the trivial subgroup {e}, hsi, hr2 i\nand hri. On the other hand there are six conjugacy classes of sets {x, x\u22121 }: {e},\n{r, r9 }, {r2 , r8 }, {r3 , r7 }, {r4 , r6 }, {r5 , r5 } and {s, s}.

Carter shows in [C80a] that\nfor q \u2264 \u22122, Kq (ZF ) = 0 when F is a finite group. To compute W hq (A5 \u00d7 Z/2) for\nq \u2264 1, we first claim that\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2Z q = 1\nW hq (A5 ) = 0 q = 0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0 q \u2264 \u22121.\nThis can be seen as follows: by [O89, Theorem 14.6], we have that SK1 (ZA5 ) = 0.\nThe group A5 has precisely five (mutually nonisomorphic) irreducible real representation, giving r = 5. In A5 the conjugacy classes of cyclic subgroups are represented\nby the trivial subgroup {e}, h(12)(34)i, h(123)i, h(12345)i giving us that q = 4. This\nforces W h(A5 ) \u223c\n= Zr\u2212q = Z. By [EM76], we have that K\u03030 (ZA5 ) = 0; Dress induction as used in [O89, Theorem 11.2] shows that K\u22121 (ZA5 ) = 0, and by [C80a] we\nhave that Kq (ZA5 ) = 0 for q \u2264 \u22122.\n\nNow let us compute W h(A5 \u00d7 Z/2). Magurn in [Ma, Example 5] shows that\nSK1 (Z[A5 \u00d7Z/2]) = 0.

To see this, let H be a subgroup of G. For any locally free ZG-module M its restriction to H (denoted by\nMH ) is a locally free ZH-module.

Since K\u22121 (ZD5 ) =\n0 (see Section 5.2), and K\u22121 (ZD10 ) = Z (see Section 5.3), we see that for Q =\nD10 \u2217D5 D10 , we have K\u22121 (ZQ) = Z \u2295 Z.\nFor the remaining K-groups, we make use of [CP02, Lemma 3.8].

In our tables, we denote these groups by\nN il0 = N K0 (Z D4 ) and N il1 = N K1 (Z D4 ) (the lower Nil groups vanish by work\nof Farrell-Jones [FJ95]). These abelian groups are known to have the following\nproperties:\n(1) N il1 is either trivial or infinitely generated [F77],\n(2) N il0 is infinitely generated (see below),\n(3) in both of these groups, the order of every element divides 8 ([CP02], [G07]).\nIt is very likely that the group N il1 is also non-trivial, but we were unable to\nestablish this result. In order to see that N il0 is non-trivial, consider the following\nCartesian square:\nZ[Z /4] \u223c\n= Z[a]/a4 \u2212 1 = 0\n\n/ Z[a]/a2 \u2212 1 = 0 \u223c\n= Z[Z /2]\n\n\u000f\nZ[i] \u223c\n= Z[a]/a2 + 1 = 0\n\n\u000f\n/ F2 [a]/a2 \u2212 1 = 0 \u223c\n= F2 [Z /2]\n\nwhich yields the Cartesian square for Z[D4 ] = Z[Z /4 \u22ca\u03b1 Z /2] = Z[Z /4]\u03b1 [Z /2]:\nZ[Z /4]\u03b1 [Z /2]\n\n/ Z[Z /2][Z /2]\n\n\u000f\nZ[i]\u03b1 [Z /2]\n\n\u000f\n/ F2 [Z /2][Z /2]\n\nwhere in Z[i]\u03b1 [Z /2], the automorphism \u03b1 acts via \u03b1(i) = \u2212i. Writing D2 =\nZ /2 \u00d7 Z /2 and A = Z[i]\u03b1 [Z /2], and applying the N K-functor, this Cartesian\nsquare yields the Mayer-Vietoris sequence:\nN K2 (F2 [D2 ]) \u2192N il1 \u2192 N K1 (Z[D2 ]) \u2295 N K1 (A) \u2192 N K1 (F2 [D2 ]) \u2192\n\n\u2192 N il0 \u2192 N K0 (Z[D2 ]) \u2295 N K0 (A) \u2192 N K0 (F2 [D2 ])\n\nSeveral of the groups appearing in this Mayer-Vietoris sequence are known: the\ngroup N K0 (F2 [D2 ]) vanishes by [Bas68], while the authors have previously shown\n[LO] that the groups N K1 (Z[D2 ]) and N K0 (Z[D2 ]) are likewise countable infinite\nsums of Z /2.\nFocusing on the tail end of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, and substituting in the\nexpressions we already know, we see that:\nM\n. . . \u2192 N il0 \u2192 N K0 (A) \u2295\nZ /2 \u2192 0\n\u221e\n\nand non-triviality of N il0 follows from the surjectivity onto the countable infinite\nsum of Z /2.

The spectral sequences and final computations\nWe now proceed to apply Corollary 3.4 to compute the lower algebraic K-theory\nof Z \u0393, for \u0393 one of the 32 possible 3-simplex hyperbolic reflection groups. Let\nus recall that Corollary 3.4 tells us that for such groups \u0393, we have for n \u2264 1 an\nisomorphism:\nKn (Z \u0393) \u223c\n= Hn\u0393 (EVC (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e ) \u2295\n\nk\nM\ni=1\n\nHnVi (EF IN (Vi ) \u2192 \u2217)\n\nwhere {Vi }ki=1 are a complete set of representatives for the conjugacy classes of\nmaximal infinite virtually cyclic subgroups of Type I.\nWe first note that for all 32 of our groups, we have:\n\u2022 obtained in Section 4 a complete list of the Type I maximal infinite virtually\ncyclic subgroups (listed out in Tables 2, 3, and 4).\n\u2022 computed in Section 6 the groups\nHnV (EF IN (V ) \u2192 \u2217)\n\nfor all the Type I maximal infinite virtually cyclic subgroups that occur,\nwith the exception of the case V = D4 \u00d7 D\u221e .\n\nIn particular, this allows us to determine the expression\nk\nM\ni=1\n\nHnVi (EF IN (Vi ) \u2192 \u2217)\n\noccurring in the formula above for all 32 of our groups.\nHence we are left with computing Hn\u0393 (EVC (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e ) for each of our 32 groups.\nIn order to do this, we recall that Quinn [Qu82] established the existence of a\nspectral sequence which converges to this homology group, with E 2 -terms given\nby:\n2\nEp,q\n= Hp (EF IN (\u0393)/ \u0393 ; {W hq (\u0393\u03c3 )}) =\u21d2 W hp+q (\u0393).\n\nThe complex that gives the homology of EVC (\u0393)/ \u0393 with local coefficients {W hq (\u0393\u03c3 )}\nhas the form\nM\nM\nM\nM\n*** \u2192\nW hq (\u0393\u03c3p+1 ) \u2192\nW hq (\u0393\u03c3p ) \u2192\nW hq (\u0393\u03c30 ),\nW hq (\u0393\u03c3p\u22121 ) * * * \u2192\n\u03c3p+1\np\n\n\u03c3p\n\n\u03c3p\u22121\n\n\u03c30\n\nwhere \u03c3 denotes the cells in dimension p, and the sum is over all p-dimensional\ncells in EVC (\u0393)/ \u0393.

In the case of the 23 nonuniform lattices, one can \u0393-equivariantly remove a disjoint collection of horoballs\nfrom H3 to form a \u0393-space X\u0393 on which \u0393 acts cocompactly. A fundamental\ndomain for the \u0393-action on the space X\u0393 can be obtained by (1) taking the 3simplex fundamental domain \u22063\u0393 for the \u0393-action on H3 , and (2) removing a small\nneighborhood of each ideal vertex in \u22063\u0393 .\nFor the resulting fundamental domain X\u0393 /\u0393, it is particularly easy to identify\nthe stabilizers of each cell. Indeed, there will always be a single 3-dimensional cell,\nwith trivial isotropy. The 2-dimensional cells will consist of\n(1) precisely four cells corresponding to the original faces of \u22063\u0393 , each of which\nwill have stabilizer Z /2,\n(2) one additional cell for each ideal vertex (obtained from \"truncating\" the\nvertex), with trivial stabilizer.\nNote that since W hq (1) and W hq (Z /2) vanish for all q \u2264 1, this in particular\nimplies that there will never be any contribution to the E 2 -terms from the 32\ndimensional and 2-dimensional cells. In other words, Ep,q\n= 0 except possibly\nfor p = 0, 1.\nNow let us focus on the 1-dimensional and 0-dimensional cells in the fundamental\ndomain X\u0393 . The 1-dimensional cells will consist of\n(1) precisely six edges, corresponding to the original edges of \u22063\u0393 , each of which\nwill have stabilizer a dihedral group Dn (n = 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n(2) three new edges for each ideal vertex (obtained from \"truncating the vertex), with stabilizer Z /2.\nNote that amongst these groups, the only ones that have some non-trivial W hq are\nthe groups D5 (for q = 1) and D6 (for q = \u22121). Now the 0-dimensional cells that\noccur consist of\n(1) one vertex for each of the non-ideal vertices in \u22063\u0393 . Each of these vertices\nwill have stabilizer a spherical Coxeter group, isomorphic to the special\nsubgroup of the Coxeter group \u0393 which corresponds to the vertex (up to\nisomorphism, these are the groups occuring in Table 1).\n(2) one new vertex for each edge leading into an ideal vertex (obtained from\n\"truncating the cusp\"). The stabilizer of the vertex will coincide with the\nstabilizer of the corresponding edge (and hence be a dihedral group Dn\nwhere n = 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6)\nFor all these groups, the non-vanishing W hq can be found in Table 5.\nFinally, we observe that since the only 1-cells with non-trivial W hq are the groups\nD5 and D6 , most of the morphisms in the chain complex for the E 2 -terms will either\nbe zero (or in a few cases, will clearly be isomorphisms). The three morphisms one\nneeds to take care with are:\n\n\f24\n\nJEAN-FRAN\u00c7OIS LAFONT AND IVONNE J.

The map K\u22121 (Z D6 ) \u2192 K\u22121 (Z[D6 \u00d7 Z /2]). We start by observing that\nK\u22121 (Z D6 ) \u223c\n= Z and K\u22121 (Z[D6 \u00d7 Z /2]) \u223c\n= Z3 (see Table 5). We claim that the map\ninduced by the natural inclusion D6 \u0592\u2192 D6 \u00d7Z /2 is injective, and the quotient group\nis isomorphic to Z2 . In order to see this, we merely note that there is a retraction\nfrom D6 \u00d7 Z /2 to the subgroup D6 , and hence we must have that K\u22121 (Z D6 ) \u223c\n=Z\n3\n\u223c\nis a summand inside K\u22121 (Z[D6 \u00d7 Z /2]) = Z , which immediately gives our claim.\n\n\u223cZ\n7.2. The map W h(D5 ) \u2192 W h(D10 ). We start by observing that W h(D5 ) =\nand W h(D10 ) \u223c\n= Z2 (see Table 5). We claim that the map induced by the natural\ninclusion D5 \u0592\u2192 D10 \u223c\n= D5 \u00d7 Z /2 is injective, and the quotient group is isomorphic\nto Z. But again, we see that there is a retraction from D5 \u00d7 Z /2 to the subgroup\nD5 , and hence W h(D5 ) \u223c\n= Z is a summand inside W h(D10 ) \u223c\n= Z2 , which gives us\nour claim. Note that this map was used implicitly in Section 6.1 (in the argument\nmentioned in the second paragraph).\n7.3. The map W h(D5 ) \u2192 W h(A5 \u00d7 Z /2). We start by observing that W h(D5 ) \u223c\n=\nZ and W h(A5 \u00d7 Z /2) \u223c\n= Z2 (see Table 5). We claim that the map induced by the\nnatural inclusion D5 \u0592\u2192 A5 \u00d7 Z /2 is injective, and the quotient group is isomorphic\nto Z. Note that in this case we do not have a retraction from the group A5 \u00d7 Z /2 to\nthe subgroup D5 (since A5 is simple, the only possible non-trivial quotients would\nbe isomorphic Z /2, A5 , or A5 \u00d7 Z /2).\nLet us start by observing that, from the inclusion D5 \u0592\u2192 A5 , we obtain that the\ninclusion D5 \u0592\u2192 A5 \u00d7 Z /2 factors through:\n\u223c D10 \u0592\u2192 A5 \u00d7 Z /2\nD5 \u0592\u2192 D5 \u00d7 Z /2 =\nwhich implies the map on Whitehead groups likewise factors through:\nW h(D5 ) \u2192 W h(D10 ) \u2192 W h(A5 \u00d7 Z /2).\n\nObserve that the first map in the above sequence was analyzed in the previous\nSection 7.2. Furthermore the last two groups in this sequence are abstractly isomorphic to Z2 . So in order to obtain our claim, all we need to do is establish that\nthe inclusion D10 \u0592\u2192 A5 \u00d7 Z /2 induces an isomorphism on Whitehead groups.\nIn order to do this, we recall that Dress induction provides us with an isomorphism (see [O89, Chapter 11]):\nW h(A5 \u00d7 Z /2) \u223c\n= lim\n\u2212\u2192H\u2208H(A5 \u00d7Z /2) W h(H).\nHere H(A5 \u00d7 Z /2) consists of all hyperelementary subgroups of A5 \u00d7 Z /2, the limit\nis over all maps induced by inclusion and conjugation, and the isomorphism is naturally induced by the inclusions. Now recall (Section 5.4) that the hyperelementary\nsubgroups of A5 \u00d7 Z /2 are, up to isomorphism: (Z /2)2 , (Z /2)3 , D3 , D5 , D6 , and\nD10 . Amongst these groups (see Table 5), the only groups with non-trivial W h\nare the groups D5 and D10 , with W h(D5 ) \u223c\n= Z and W h(D10 ) \u223c\n= Z2 . Furthermore,\ninside the group A5 \u00d7 Z /2, it is easy to see that:\n(1) every subgroup isomorphic to D5 lies inside a subgroup isomorphic to D10 ,\n(2) all the subgroups isomorphic to D10 are pairwise conjugate.\n\n\fLOWER ALGEBRAIC K-THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC 3-SIMPLEX REFLECTION GROUPS. 25\n\nThis immediately implies that the direct limit to the right is canonically isomorphic\nto W h(D10 ), which gives us our desired claim.\n\nK\u03030 6= 0\n\n\u0393\n\nK\u22121 6= 0\n\n[3, 5, 3]\n\nZ4\n\n[5, 3, 5]\n\nZ4\n\n[(33 , 4)]\n\nZ2\n\n[5, 31,1 ]\n\nZ2\n\n[4, 3, 5]\n\nZ3\n\n[(33 , 5)]\n\nZ2\n\n[(3, 5)[2] ]\n\nZ4\n\n[(3, 4)[2] ]\n\nZ4\n\n(Z/4)4 \u2295\n\n[(3, 4, 3, 5)]\n\nZ4\n\n(Z/4)2 \u2295\n\nL\n\n\u221e\n\nL\n\n\u221e\n\n(Z/4)2 \u2295\n\nZ3 \u2295\n\nZ/2\n\nZ6 \u2295\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\n(Z/4)2 \u2295\n\nZ/2\n\nL\n\nL\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\nL\n\n\u221e\n\nZ/2 \u2295 N il0\n\nL\n\n\u221e\n\nZ3 \u2295\nL\n\nZ3 \u2295\n\nZ/2\n\nZ6 \u2295\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\nL\n\n\u221e\n\nL\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\nZ3 \u2295\n\n\u221e\n\nL\n\nZ/2 \u2295 N il0\n\nL\n\nZ/2 \u2295 N il0\n\nZ3 \u2295\n\n\u221e\n\nZ/2\nZ/2\n\nZ/2 \u2295 N il1\n\nZ/2\n\nL\nL\n\nZ/2 \u2295 N il0\n\nZ/2\n\nL\n\nL\n\nW h 6= 0\n\nZ/2\n\nZ/2 \u2295 N il1\n\nL\n\n\u221e\n\nL\n\n\u221e\n\nZ/2\nZ/2\n\nZ/2 \u2295 N il1\n\nL\n\n\u221e\n\nZ/2 \u2295 N il1\n\nTable 6: The lower algebraic K-theory of the cocompact hyperbolic 3-simplex groups\n7.4.

In order to simplify\nthe notation in the tables, we will use N il0 and N il1 to denote these two Nil-groups.\nRecall that we know that the groups N il0 , N il1 are torsion groups, where the order\nof every element divides 8, and furthermore the group N il0 is infinitely generated\n(see Section 5.5).\n8. Appendix: two specific examples.\nIn this Appendix we work through the entire procedure for two specific examples (one cocompact, and one non-cocompact), with a view of helping the reader\nunderstand the layout of the paper.\n8.1. The group [(3, 5)[2] ]. The Coxeter diagram for this group \u0393 can be found in\nFigure 1, from which the following presentation can be read off (see Section 2):\nhw, x, y, z | w2 = x2 = y 2 = z 2 = 1,\n(wx)3 = (xy)5 = (yz)3 = (zw)5 = (wy)2 = (xz)2 = 1i.\nThis group acts on H3 cocompactly, with fundamental domain a 3-simplex \u22063 .\nAfter labeling the hyperplanes extending the four faces by the four generators of \u0393,\nthe angles between these hyperplanes satisfy the following relationships (see Section\n2):\n\u2022 \u2220(Pw , Py ) = \u2220(Px , Pz ) = \u03c0/2,\n\u2022 \u2220(Pw , Px ) = \u2220(Py , Pz ) = \u03c0/3,\n\u2022 \u2220(Pw , Pz ) = \u2220(Px , Py ) = \u03c0/5.\nIn particular, the action of \u0393 on H3 gives a cocompact model for EF IN (\u0393),\nand the splitting formula (see Corollary 3.4) tells us that we have, for all n \u2264 1,\nisomorphisms:\nKn (Z \u0393) \u223c\n= Hn\u0393 (EF IN (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e ) \u2295\n\nk\nM\ni=1\n\nHnVi (EF IN (Vi ) \u2192 \u2217).\n\nLet us now identify the (finitely many) groups {Vi } that appear in the above\nformula. As explained in Section 4, these groups will arise as stabilizers of Type I\ngeodesics, which are precisely (up to the \u0393-action) one of the six geodesics Pw \u2229 Px ,\nPw \u2229 Py , Pw \u2229 Pz , Px \u2229 Py , Px \u2229 Pz , and Py \u2229 Pz . To identify the stabilizers of these\ngeodesics, we first need to identify the vertex stabilizers for the simplex \u22063 . Recall\nthat these will be the special subgroups generated by triples of generators. But\nfrom the Coxeter diagram for \u0393, one immediately sees that any triple of vertices\nspans out a subdiagram corresponding to the Coxeter group [3, 5]. This implies that\nevery vertex has stabilizer isomorphic to the (finite) Coxeter group [3, 5], which is\nwell known to be isomorphic to the group A5 \u00d7 Z /2. Now for each of the six type\nI geodesics we have, one can consider the projection to the fundamental domain\n\u22063 . From Table 1, looking up the vertex stabilizers A5 \u00d7 Z /2, we see that every\none of the six geodesics projects to precisely the associated edge in \u22063 . Now to\nfind the stabilizers of the geodesics, one applies Bass-Serre theory. The stabilizer\nacts on each of the geodesics with quotient a segment, so one can write each of the\nstabilizers as a generalized free product. Furthermore, Table 1 allows us to identify\nthe vertex groups in the Bass-Serre graph of groups.\n\n\f28\n\nJEAN-FRAN\u00c7OIS LAFONT AND IVONNE J. ORTIZ\n\nLet us see how this works, for instance in the case of the geodesic Px \u2229 Py . The\ntwo associated hyperplanes Px and Py intersect at an angle of \u03c0/5, hence the edge\ngroup in the Bass-Serre graph of groups will be D5 . For the vertex groups, we\nsee that the corresponding segment in \u22063 joins a pair of vertices with stabilizer\nA5 \u00d7 Z /2, and correspond to the angle of \u03c0/5 at both the vertices. The last row\nin Table 1 tells us that both the vertex groups in the Bass-Serre graph of groups\nwill be D10 . This tells us that the stabilizer of the geodesic Px \u2229 Py is precisely the\ngroup D10 \u2217D5 D10 \u223c\n= D5 \u00d7 D\u221e . Carrying this procedure out for each of the six\ngeodesics, one finds that the stabilizers one obtains are:\n\u2022 two copies of D10 \u2217D5 D10 , corresponding to the two geodesics Px \u2229 Py and\nPw \u2229 Pz ,\n\u2022 two copies of D6 \u2217D3 D6 , corresponding to the two geodesics Pw \u2229 Px and\nPy \u2229 Pz ,\n\u2022 two copies of D2 \u00d7 D\u221e , corresponding to the two geodesics Pw \u2229 Py and\nPx \u2229 Pz .\nNote that these are precisely the groups that are listed out in Table 4. Finally,\namongst these six subgroups, one needs to know which ones have a non-trivial\ncokernel for the relative assembly map. But from the work in Section 6, all the\nnon-trivial cokernels are listed out in Table 6. Looking up Table 6, one sees that\nout of these six groups, the only ones with\nL non-trivial cokernels are the two copies\nof D2 \u00d7 D\u221e , each of whom contributes \u221e Z /2 to the K0 (Z \u0393) and W h(\u0393).\nSo we are finally left with computing the homology coming from the finite subgroups, i.e. the term Hn\u0393 (EF IN (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e ). As we mentioned earlier, a cocompact\nfundamental domain for H3 /\u0393 is given by \u22063 . The stabilizers of cells in the fundamental domain can be read off from the Coxeter diagram, as they will precisely be\nthe special subgroups (see the discussion in Section 7). We see that:\n\u2022 there is one 3-dimensional cell (the interior of \u22063 ), with trivial stabilizer,\n\u2022 there are four 2-dimensional cells (the faces of \u22063 ), with stabilizer Z /2,\n\u2022 there are six 1-dimensional cells (the edges of \u22063 ), two of which have stabilizer D2 , two of which have stabilizer D3 , and two of which have stabilizer\nD5 ,\n\u2022 there are four 0-dimensional cells (the vertices of \u22063 ), each of which has\nstabilizer A5 \u00d7 Z /2.\n\nNow to obtain the E 2 -terms in the Quinn spectral sequence, we need the homology\nof the complex:\n*** \u2192\n\nM\n\n\u03c3p+1\n\nW hq (\u0393\u03c3p+1 ) \u2192\n\nM\n\u03c3p\n\nW hq (\u0393\u03c3p ) \u2192\n\nM\n\n\u03c3p\u22121\n\nW hq (\u0393\u03c3p\u22121 ) * * * \u2192\n\nM\n\nW hq (\u0393\u03c30 ),\n\n\u03c30\n\nwhere \u03c3 p are the p-dimensional cells (which we identified above). But from the work\nin Section 5, we know explicitly all the groups appearing in the above complex.\nIndeed, looking up the non-zero K-groups in Table 5, we see that for q < \u22121, the\nentire complex is identically zero. For the remaining values of q, we have:\nq = \u22121: The complex degenerates to\n0 \u2192 4K\u22121 (Z[A5 \u00d7 Z /2]) \u2192 0,\n\n\fLOWER ALGEBRAIC K-THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC 3-SIMPLEX REFLECTION GROUPS. 29\n\nwhere the four copies of K\u22121 (Z[A5 \u00d7 Z /2]) come from the four vertices of \u22063 . Since\n2\nwe know (see Table 5) that K\u22121 (Z[A5 \u00d7 Z /2]) \u223c\n= Z, we immediately get that Ep,\u22121\n4\n2\n\u223c\nall vanish, with the exception of E0,\u22121\n=Z .\n2\nq = 0: The complex is identically zero, and hence we see that Ep,0\nall vanish.\n\nq = 1: The complex degenerates to:\n0 \u2192 2W h(D5 ) \u2192 4W h(A5 \u00d7 Z /2) \u2192 0.\n\nNote that the first copy of W h(D5 ) comes from the edge Px \u2229 Py \u2229 \u22063 , while\nthe second copy of W h(D5 ) comes from the Pw \u2229 Pz \u2229 \u22063 . The four copies of\nW h(A5 \u00d7 Z /2) come from the four vertices of \u22063 .\nSince the two edges Px \u2229 Py \u2229 \u22063 and Pw \u2229 Pz \u2229 \u22063 are disjoint, the complex\nsplits as a sum of two subcomplexes, one for each of the two edges. Focusing on\nthe first edge, we see that we have:\n0 \u2192 W h(D5 ) \u2192 2W h(A5 \u00d7 Z /2) \u2192 0\nWe know that W h(D5 ) \u223c\n= Z2 (see Table 5), and that the\n= Z and W h(A5 \u00d7 Z /2) \u223c\nmap W h(D5 ) \u0592\u2192 W h(A5 \u00d7 Z /2) induced by inclusion is split injective (see Section\n7.3). This immediately tells us that in the chain complex above, we have that\n2W h(A5 \u00d7 Z /2)/W h(D5) \u223c\n= Z3 . An identical analysis for the other edge gives us\n2 \u223c\n2 \u223c 6\nthat the homology of the original complex yields E1,1\n= 0 and E0,1\n=Z .\nCombining everything we've said so far, we see that for the Quinn spectral\n2 \u223c 6\n2\n\u223c\nsequence, the only non-zero E 2 -terms are E0,\u22121\n= Z . This implies\n= Z4 and E0,1\nthat the spectral sequence immediately collapses, giving us that\nH \u0393 (EF IN (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e ) \u223c\n=0\nn\n\nfor n < \u22121, n = 0, and\n\n\u0393\nH\u22121\n(EF IN (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e ) \u223c\n= Z4 ,\n\nH1\u0393 (EF IN (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e ) \u223c\n= Z6 .\nWe now have both the terms appearing in the splitting formula, and we conclude\nthat the lower algebraic K-theory of the group \u0393 is given by:\n\uf8f1\nL\nW h(\u0393) \u223c\n= Z6 \u2295 \u221e Z /2, n = 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nL\n\uf8f2\nn=0\nK\u03030 (Z \u0393) \u223c\n= \u221e Z /2,\nW hn (\u0393) =\n4\n\u223c\n\uf8f4\nK\n(Z\u0393)\nZ\n,\nn = \u22121\n=\n\u22121\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u223c\nKn (Z\u0393) = 0,\nn \u2264 \u22121.\nLooking up Table 6, one finds that these are precisely the values reported.\n\n8.2. The group [3, 41,1 ]. The Coxeter diagram for this group \u0393 can be found in\nFigure 2, from which the following presentation can be read off (see Section 2):\nhw, x, y, z | w2 = x2 = y 2 = z 2 = 1,\n\n(wx)3 = (xy)4 = (yz)2 = (zw)2 = (wy)2 = (xz)4 = 1i.\nThis group acts on H3 with cofinite volume, with fundamental domain a (noncompact) 3-simplex \u22063 with one ideal vertex. After labeling the hyperplanes extending the four faces by the four generators of \u0393, the angles between these hyperplanes satisfy the following relationships (see Section 2):\n\n\f30\n\nJEAN-FRAN\u00c7OIS LAFONT AND IVONNE J. ORTIZ\n\n\u2022 \u2220(Pw , Py ) = \u2220(Pw , Pz ) = \u2220(Pw , Pz ) = \u03c0/2,\n\u2022 \u2220(Pw , Px ) = \u03c0/3,\n\u2022 \u2220(Px , Pz ) = \u2220(Px , Py ) = \u03c0/4.\n\nThe ideal vertex arises as the intersection (at infinity) of the three hyperplanes\nPx \u2229 Py \u2229 Pz , and has stabilizer the 2-dimensional crystallographic group [4, 4].\nWhile the action of \u0393 on H3 does not give a cocompact model for EF IN (\u0393),\none can obtain such a model by \u0393-equivariantly truncating disjoint horospheres\ncentered at the \u0393-orbits of the ideal vertex (see Section 7). The splitting formula\n(see Corollary 3.4) tells us that we have, for all n \u2264 1, isomorphisms:\nKn (Z \u0393) \u223c\n= Hn\u0393 (EF IN (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e ) \u2295\n\nk\nM\ni=1\n\nHnVi (EF IN (Vi ) \u2192 \u2217).\n\nLet us now identify the (finitely many) groups {Vi } that appear in the above\nformula. As explained in Section 4, these groups will arise as stabilizers of Type I\ngeodesics, which are precisely (up to the \u0393-action) one of the six geodesics Pw \u2229 Px ,\nPw \u2229Py , Pw \u2229Pz , Px \u2229Py , Px \u2229Pz , and Py \u2229Pz . Note that since the geodesic segments\nPx \u2229 Py , Py \u2229 Pz and Px \u2229 Pz project to non-compact segments in the fundamental\ndomain (they give rise to edges joined to the ideal vertex), these geodesics will\nnever have an infinite stabilizer, and we can hence safely ignore them.\nTo identify the stabilizers of the remaining three geodesics, we follow the procedure from Section 4. We first need to identify the (non-ideal) vertex stabilizers\nfor the simplex \u22063 . Recall that these will be the special subgroups generated by\ntriples of generators. But from the Coxeter diagram for \u0393, one immediately sees\nthat the triple of vertices span out the subdiagrams:\n\u2022 the Coxeter group [3, 4] \u223c\n= S4 \u00d7 Z /2 will be the stabilizer of the vertices\nPw \u2229 Px \u2229 Pz and of the vertex Pw \u2229 Px \u2229 Py ,\n\u2022 the group (Z /2)3 will be the stabilizer of the vertex Pw \u2229 Py \u2229 Pz .\n\nNow for each of the three (potentially cocompact) type I geodesics that we have\n(Pw \u2229 Px , Pw \u2229 Py , and Pw \u2229 Pz ) one can consider the projection to the fundamental\ndomain \u22063 . From Table 1, looking up the vertex stabilizers S4 \u00d7 Z /2, we see that\nevery one of the three geodesics projects to precisely the associated edge in \u22063 .\nTo find the stabilizers of these geodesics, we now use Bass-Serre theory as explained in Section 4. To find the vertex groups, one uses Table 1, while the edge\ngroup will be precisely the dihedral group given by the special subgroup associated\nto the geodesic. This immediately gives us the stabilizers:\n\u2022 one copy of D6 \u2217D3 D6 , corresponding to the geodesic Pw \u2229 Px ,\n\u2022 two copies of (Z /2 \u00d7 D2) \u2217D2 (Z /2 \u00d7 D2) \u223c\n= D2 \u00d7 D\u221e , corresponding to the\ntwo geodesics Pw \u2229 Py and Pw \u2229 Pz ,\n\nwhich are precisely the groups reported in Table 3. Finally, amongst these three\nsubgroups, one needs to decide which ones have a non-trivial cokernel for the relative\nassembly map. These cokernels are listed out in Table 6, and one sees that the only\nnon-trivial contribution\nwill come from the two copies of D2 \u00d7 D\u221e , each of which\nL\nwill contribute \u221e Z /2 to the K\u03030 (Z \u0393) and W h(\u0393).\nSo we are finally left with computing the homology coming from the finite subgroups, i.e. the term Hn\u0393 (EF IN (\u0393); KZ\u2212\u221e ). As we mentioned earlier, a cocompact\nfundamental domain for H3 /\u0393 is given by \"truncating\" the ideal vertex from \u22063 .\n\n\fLOWER ALGEBRAIC K-THEORY OF HYPERBOLIC 3-SIMPLEX REFLECTION GROUPS. 31\n\nThe stabilizers of cells in the fundamental domain can be read off from the Coxeter diagram, as they will precisely be the special subgroups (see the discussion in\nSection 7). We see that:\n\u2022 there is one 3-dimensional cell (the interior of \u22063 ), with trivial stabilizer,\n\u2022 there are five 2-dimensional cells, with stabilizer Z /2 (for the faces of the\noriginal \u22063 ), or trivial (for the face coming from truncating the ideal vertex\nin \u22063 ),\n\u2022 there are nine 1-dimensional cells (the six edges of \u22063 , and three edges\nobtained from the truncation). Three of these will have stabilizer Z /2\n(those coming from truncating the ideal vertex in \u22063 ), three will have\nstabilizer D2 (from the edges corresponding to Py \u2229 Pz , Pw \u2229 Py , and Pw \u2229\nPz ), two will have stabilizer D4 (from the edges corresponding to Px \u2229 Py\nand Px \u2229 Pz ), and one with stabilizer D3 (from the edge corresponding to\nPw \u2229 Px ),\n\u2022 there are six 0-dimensional cells (three non-ideal vertices of \u22063 , and three\nfrom the truncation of the ideal vertex). Two have stabilizers D4 (from the\ntruncation of the two edges with the same stabilizer), one has stabilizer D2\n(from the truncation of the third edge), two have stabilizer S4 \u00d7 Z /2 (from\ntwo of the non-ideal vertices), and one has stabilizer (Z /2)3 (from the third\nnon-ideal vertex).\nNow to obtain the E 2 -terms in the Quinn spectral sequence, we need the homology\nof the complex:\nM\nM\nM\nM\n*** \u2192\nW hq (\u0393\u03c3p+1 ) \u2192\nW hq (\u0393\u03c3p ) \u2192\nW hq (\u0393\u03c3p\u22121 ) * * * \u2192\nW hq (\u0393\u03c30 ),\n\u03c3p+1\np\n\n\u03c3p\n\n\u03c3p\u22121\n\n\u03c30\n\nwhere \u03c3 are the p-dimensional cells (which we identified above). But from the work\nin Section 5, we know explicitly all the groups appearing in the above complex.\nIndeed, looking up the non-zero K-groups in Table 5, we see that the only one\nof the cell stabilizers that has non-trivial K-theory is the group S4 \u00d7 Z /2. There\nare two copies of this group, arising as stabilizers of 0-cells, and we have that\nK\u22121 (Z[S4 \u00d7 Z /2]) \u223c\n= Z and K\u03030 (Z[S4 \u00d7 Z /2]) \u223c\n= Z /4.
