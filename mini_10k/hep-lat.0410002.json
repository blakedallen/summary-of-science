Motivation\nThe phase structure of QCD is relevant in the\ndescription of various phenomena: from subtle\nmodifications of the cross-sections in high energy\ncollisions of nuclei to exotic states of nuclear matter in neutron stars. Even though we have a good\nunderstanding of how to perform simulations at\nzero baryon density and finite temperature, the\nsimulation with non-zero chemical potential has\nbeen problematic.\nTo deal with the complex phase that the chemical potential introduces to the fermion determinant, a number of techniques have been proposed:\nvarious reweighting methods, imaginary chemical potential, etc. They allow us to explore the\nphase structure at small values of the chemical\npotential and temperatures close to the critical\ntemperature. All these methods have as a starting point the grand canonical partition function.\nWe will present here an approach based on the\ncanonical partition function which alleviates the\nsign problem, the overlap problem and the determinant fluctuation problems [1,2]. Some preliminary results will also be reported.\n\nwhere det M\u03c6 is the fermion determinant of the\nquark matrix with an additional U(1) phase\nei\u03c6 /e\u2212i\u03c6 in the time forward/backward links on\none time slice. Therefore, the canonical partition\nfunction can be written as\nZ\nZ 2\u03c0\nd\u03c6 \u2212i\u03c6k\ne\ndet M\u03c6 . (2)\nZC (k, T ) = DU e\u2212SG\n2\u03c0\n0\nOne can also derive this from the Fourier transform of the grand canonical partition function [4]\nZ 2\u03c0\nd\u03c6 \u2212i\u03c6k\nZC (k, T ) =\ne\nZGC (\u03bcq = i\u03c6T, T )\n2\u03c0\n0\nTo see this we can use the fugacity expansion of\nthe grand canonical partition function\nZGC (\u03bcq , T ) =\n\n12V\nX\n\nZC (k, T )e\u03bcq k/T\n\n(3)\n\nk=\u221212V\n\n2. Canonical partition function\n\nwhere k = nq \u2212 nq\u0304 is the quark number and \u03bcq\nis the quark chemical potential. Using the usual\nexpression for Lattice QCD grand canonical partition function, one obtains the same expression\nas in Eq. (2).\n\nThe QCD canonical partition function with a\nfixed quark number can be constructed from the\n\u2217 Talks\n\npresented by Andrei Alexandru and Keh-Fei Liu at\nLattice 2004 conference.\n\n1\n\n\f2\nFor Wilson fermions we can write M\u03c6 (U ) \u2261\nM (U\u03c6 ) = M (\u03bc = i\u03c6T, U ) in terms of the standard fermion matrix\n[M (U )]m,n\n\n=\n\n\u03b4m,n \u2212 \u03ba(1 \u2212 \u03b3\u03bc )U\u03bc (m)\u03b4m+\u03bc,n\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03ba(1 + \u03b3\u03bc )U\u03bc\u2020 (n)\u03b4m,n+\u03bc\n\nand some modified gauge fields\n\u001a\nU\u03bc (n)e\u2212i\u03c6 n4 = Nt , \u03bc = 4\n(U\u03c6 )\u03bc (n) \u2261\nU\u03bc (n)\notherwise.\n\n(4)\n\nThis should not be viewed as a change of the field\nvariables but rather as a convenient way of writing the partition function. We should also note\nthat although originally the phase e\u2212i\u03c6T appears\non all timelike links, we can accumulate it on the\nlast time slice through a change of variables.\nIn order to evaluate the canonical partition\nfunction in Eq. (2) we need to replace the continuous Fourier transform with a discrete one. Using\nthe discrete Fourier transform of the determinant\ndetk M (U ) \u2261\n\nN \u22121\n1 X \u2212ik\u03c6n\ndet M\u03c6n (U )\ne\nN n=0\n\nwith \u03c6n = 2\u03c0n\nN , we write the partition function as\nZ\nZ\u0303C (k) = DU e\u2212SG (U) detk M (U )\n(5)\nThis is the partition function that we will try to\nevaluate. The parameter N defines the Fourier\ntransform. In the limit N \u2192 \u221e we recover the\noriginal partition function. For finite N the partition function will only be an approximation of the\ncanonical partition function. Using the fugacity\nexpansion we can show that\nZ\u0303C (k) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nZC (k + mN )\n\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\nIf FB denotes the baryon free energy we expect\nthat\nZC (NB ) \u221d e\u2212|NB |FB /T ,\nin the confined phase. If this holds true then\nZ\u0303C (k) \u2248 ZC (k) for k \u226a N . However, this is\nan expectation that needs to be checked in our\nsimulations.\n\n3. Algorithm\nTo evaluate Z\u0303C (k) by Monte-Carlo techniques\nwe need the integrand in (5) to be real and positive. Using the \u03b35 hermiticity of the Wilson matrix it is easy to prove that det M (U\u03c6 ) is real.\nHowever, the integrand in (5) is the Fourier transform of the Wilson determinant. For detk M\nto be real we need that det M\u03c6 = det M\u2212\u03c6 .\nFrom charge conjugation symmetry we know that\nhdet M\u03c6 i = hdet M\u2212\u03c6 i. Unfortunately this relation doesn't hold configuration by configuration.\nWe are thus forced to remove the complex phase\nfrom detk M .\nTo avoid dealing with the complex phase we\nwill generate an ensemble using |Re detk M | as our\nprobability function and we will then reintroduce\nthe complex phase in observables. This is the\nstandard way to deal with a complex phase in\nthe weight function. It is also the source of the\ninfamous sign problem. This might limit us in\nfully exploring the parameter space.\nThe focus of the algorithm will then be to generate an ensemble with the weight\nW (U ) = e\n\n\u2212SG (U)\n\nN \u22121\n1 X\ncos(\u03c6n k) det M\u03c6n (U ) .\nN n=0\n\nIt was pointed out in [5] that taking the Fourier\ntransform after the Monte Carlo simulations with\ndifferent \u03c6n leads to an overlap problem. To avoid\nthis problem, it was stressed [2,1] that it is essential to perform the Fourier transform first to\nlock into one particular quark (or baryon) sector\nbefore the accept/reject step. The general approach is to break the updating process into two\nsteps. In this case, one first uses an update for an\napproximate weight W \u2032 (U ), and then use an accept/reject step to correct for the approximation.\nThe efficiency of this strategy depends on how\ngood the approximation is. For a poor approximation the acceptance rate in the second step will\nbe very small.\nOne possible solution would be to update the\ngauge links using a heatbath for pure gauge action. In that case W \u2032 (U ) = e\u2212SG (U) . However, it\nis known that such an updating strategy is very\ninefficient since the fermionic part is completely\n\n\f3\n\n2\n\nArg@PD\n\ndisregarded in the proposal step and the determinant, being an extensive quantity, can fluctuate wildly from one configuration to the next in\nthe pure gauge updating process [6]. To avoid\nthe overlap problem and the leading fluctuation\nin the determinant, it is proposed [1] to update\nusing the HMC algorithm in the first step. For\nsimplicity we will be simulating two degenerate\nflavors of quarks. This allows us to use the standard HMC update. In this case we have\n\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n0\n\n50\n\n100 150 200\niteration\n\n250\n\n300\n\nW \u2032 (U ) = e\u2212SG (U) det M (U )\nIn the second step we have to accept/reject\nwith the probability\n\nFigure 1. Polyakov loop argument as a function\nof simulation time.\n\nPacc = min {1, \u03c9(U \u2032 )/\u03c9(U )}\nwhere \u03c9 is the ratio of the weights\n\u03c9(U ) =\n\nW (U )\n|Re detk M [U ]|\n=\n.\nW \u2032 (U )\ndet M [U ]\n\nSince detk M [U ] and det M [U ] are calculated on\nthe same gauge configuration, we can write the\ndeterminant ratio as\n\u03c9(U ) =\n\nN \u22121\n1 X\ncos(\u03c6n k)eT r(log M\u03c6n \u2212log M) . (6)\nN n=0\n\nThe leading fluctuation in the determinant from\none gauge configuration to the next is removed\nby the T r log difference of the quark matrices of\nM\u03c6n (U ) and M (U ). This should greatly improve\nthe acceptance rate compared to the case with\ndirect accept/reject based on the |Re detk M (U )|\nitself.\n4. Triality\nThe canonical partition function (2) has a Z3\nsymmetry that is not present in the grand canonical partition function [7]. Under a transformation U \u2192 U\u03c6 where U\u03c6 is defined as in (4) and\n\u03c6 = \u00b1 2\u03c0\n3 we have\n] = e\u00b1i\ndetk M [U ] \u2192 detk M [U\u00b1 2\u03c0\n3\n\n2\u03c0\n3 k\n\ndetk M [U ].\n\nWe see that when k is a multiple of 3 this transformation is a symmetry of the action. Incidentally,\n\nif this symmetry is not spontaneously broken the\nrelation above guarantees that the canonical partition function will vanish for any k that is not a\nmultiple of 3.\nFor Z\u0303C , our approximation of the canonical\npartition function, to exhibit this symmetry we\nneed to choose the parameter N that defines the\ndiscrete Fourier transform to be a multiple of 3.\nIf N is a multiple of 3 we have\nW (U ) = W (U\u00b1 2\u03c0\n).\n3\nHowever, the HMC weight W \u2032 does not respect\nthis symmetry since det M is not symmetric under this transformation. In this case, our algorithm can become frozen for long periods of time.\nIn Fig. 1 we show the argument of the Polyakov\nloop as a function of the simulation time. Under\na Z3 transformation U \u2192 U\u00b1 2\u03c0\nthe argument of\n3\nthe Polyakov loop gets shifted by \u00b1 2\u03c0\n3 . The HMC\nupdate strongly prefers the 0 sector and when a\ntunneling occurs to one of the other sectors the\naccept/reject step will reject any change for a long\nperiod of time. Consequently the algorithm will\nbe very poor in sampling the other sectors.\nTo alleviate this problem we will introduce a\nZ3 hopping [8]. Since the weight W is symmetric under this change we can intermix the regular updates with a change in the field variables\n, where we will choose the sign ranU \u2192 U\u00b1 2\u03c0\n3\ndomly (equal probability for each sign) to satisfy\n\n\f4\nTable 1\nThe simulation parameters for our runs.\n\u03b2\na(fm)\nm\u03c0 (MeV) V \u22121 (fm\u22123 )\n5.1 0.35(3)\n870(90)\n0.36(12)\n5.2 0.31(2)\n920(90)\n0.52(17)\n5.3 0.24(2) 1050(100)\n1.1(3)\n\nT (MeV)\n140(14)\n160(16)\n205(20)\n\nTable 2\nAverage of real phase factor,\nk=0\nk=3\n\u03b2=5.1 1.00(0) 0.48(6)\n\u03b2=5.2 1.00(0) 0.61(8)\n\u03b2=5.3 1.00(0) 0.98(1)\n\nhRe \u03b1iW .\nk=6\n0.17(10)\n0.82(5)\n0.96(3)\n\nan observable O we have the following expression\nthe detailed balance.

Simulation details\nIn order to simulate the ensemble given by the\nweight W (U ) we need to evaluate the Fourier\ntransform of the determinant. Since the calculation of the determinant is quite time consuming\nwe will need to use N as small as possible. There\nis a proposal that employs an estimator for the\ndeterminant [9] but in this preliminary study we\nchoose to calculate the determinant exactly using LU decomposition. We were thus limited to\nrunning on very small lattices, i.e. 44 , and with\nN = 12. For each \u03b2 we run three simulations:\none for k = 0, one for k = 3 and one for k = 6.\nThey correspond to 0, 1 and 2 baryons in the box.\nIn order to get a reasonable box size we had\nto simulate at large lattice spacings. We used\n\u03b2 = 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 with fixed \u03ba = 0.158.\nThe relevant parameters can be found in Table\n1. The lattice spacing is determined using standard dynamical action on a 124 lattice for the\nsame values of \u03b2 and \u03ba. For the HMC part of\nthe update we used trajectories of length 0.5 with\n\u2206\u03c4 = 0.01. We adjusted the number of such trajectories between two consecutive accept/reject\nsteps so that the acceptance stays within the 15%\nto 30% range. The configurations were saved after 10 accept/reject steps. We collected about\n100 such configurations for each run.\n6. Observables\nAs we mentioned earlier we need to reintroduce\nthe phase when we compute the observables. For\n\nhOiZ\u0303C =\n\nhO\u03b1iW\nh\u03b1iW\n\nwhere the subscript Z\u0303C stands for integration\nover the canonical ensemble given by (5), W\nstands for the average over the weight W and\n\u03b1\u2261\n\ndetk M\n|Re detk M |\n\nis the reweighting phase. It is easy to see that the\nphase \u03b1 should average, over an infinite ensemble,\nto a real number. This is direct consequence of\nthe charge conjugation symmetry. The real part\nof this phase will always be \u00b11. This gives us a\nsimple criterion to decide whether we have a sign\nproblem; all we need to do is to check whether the\nphase has predominantly one sign. If the phase\ncomes with plus and minus signs with close to\nequal probability then we have a sign problem.\nFor our runs the data is collected in Table 2. We\nsee that for \u03b2 = 5.1 and k = 6 we are approaching\nthe sign problem region.\nAn interesting observable to measure is the\nPolyakov loop. Although the average value is\nexpected to be zero due to the Z3 symmetry,\nthe distribution in the complex plane can tell us\nwhether or not the symmetry is spontaneously\nbroken. Usually the spontaneous breaking of the\nZ3 symmetry is associated with deconfinement.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the histograms of the Polyakov\nloop for our runs. We see that as we go from\n\u03b2 = 5.2 to \u03b2 = 5.3 the symmetry is broken even\nin the k = 0 sector. This is the usual finite temperature phase transition at zero baryon density.\nAccording to Table 1 this happens somewhere between 160 MeV and 205 MeV. This is somewhat\nhigher than expected for dynamical simulations\nbut can be explained in terms of our large quark\n\n\f5\n\u0392=5.3 k=0\n300\n200\n100\n0\n30\n\n20\n\n\u0392=5.3 k=3\n\n30\n20\n10\n\n300\n200\n100\n0\n30\n\n10\n\n\u0392=5.2 k=0\n300\n200\n100\n0\n30\n\n20\n\n300\n200\n100\n0\n30\n\n10\n\n\u0392=5.1 k=0\n300\n200\n100\n0\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n20\n\n300\n200\n100\n0\n30\n\n10\n\n10\n\n300\n200\n100\n0\n30\n\n20\n\ndetk M\n\nTrk \u0393M \u22121 =\n20\n\n30\n20\n10\n\n300\n200\n100\n0\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\nmasses. More interestingly, we see that under the\ncritical temperature the transition still occurs as\nwe increase the number of baryons. It is also apparent that as we lower \u03b2 (\u03b2 = 5.1), we are approaching a region where even the NB = 1 sector\nis confined.\nAssuming that the result of NB = 1(k = 3) at\n\u03b2 = 5.1 is close to the phase transition line, the\nphase transition for T = 140 MeV occurs at the\nbaryon density of 0.36 fm\u22123 which is about 2.3\ntimes the nuclear matter density. We see from\nTable 1 that there does not seem to be a problem\nof reaching a density an order of magnitude higher\nthan that of the nuclear matter around Tc . For\nexample, for NB = 2(k = 6) at \u03b2 = 5.3, the\nbaryon density is 2.2(6) fm\u22123 which is 14 times\nthe nuclear matter density. However, we should\nnot take these numbers seriously in view of the\nsmall volume and large quark mass in the present\ncalculation (since the pion mass is 870 MeV our\nquark mass is close to the strange quark one).\nWhile it is nice to see that our expectation for\nthe phase transition are confirmed in the gluonic\nsector, one would like to explore this transition in\nthe fermionic sector too. It is important to note\nthat the fermionic observables have to be evaluated in a non-standard manner. For example, if\nwe are to study the fermionic bilinears we get\nZ\n1 1 X \u2212ik\u03c6\ne\nD\u03c8\u0304D\u03c8e\u03c8\u0304M\u03c6 \u03c8 \u03c8\u0304\u0393\u03c8\nh\u03c8\u0304\u0393\u03c8i =\nZC N\n\n1 X \u2212ik\u03c6n\n.\nTr\u0393M\u03c6\u22121\ne\nn\nN\n\u03c6n\n\n10\n\n30\n20\n10\n\n(\u2212Trk\u2212k\u2032 \u0393M \u22121 )\n\nwhere\n\n10\n\nFigure 2.

Unfortunately, it seems that\nthe quarks are too heavy for us to get any signal.\nFor example at \u03b2 = 5.1 and \u03ba = 0.158 we got\nh\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i = \u22123.612(1), \u22123.598(5) and \u22123.601(2) for\nNB = 0, 1 and 2 respectively. We suspect that we\nneed to lower the quark mass to be able to see any\nsignal in the chiral condensate. Also, since we are\nworking with Wilson fermions, the signal might\nbe obscured by the mixing between \u03c8\u0304\u03c8 and unity\nand other lattice artifacts especially at these large\nlattice spacings.\n7. Sector mixing\nIt is important to note that all the calculations\ncarried out above are using an approximation of\nthe canonical partition function. As noted before\nit is an assumption on our part that Z\u0303C \u2248 ZC .\nTo check this we measured the conserved charge\nfor Wilson fermions\nX\nQ(t) = \u2212\u03ba\n[\u03c8\u0304(x)U4 (x)(1 \u2212 \u03b34 )\u03c8(x + t\u0302)\n~\nx\n\n\u2212\u03c8\u0304(x + t\u0302)U4\u2020 (x)(1 + \u03b34 )\u03c8(x)].\nThe idea is that if we were to compute the conserved charge using the exact canonical ensemble ZC we would measure exactly the number of\nquarks we put it hQ(t)iZC (k) = k. However, in\nthe discrete case we have\nP\n(k + mN )ZC (k + mN )\n.\nhQ(t)iZ\u0303C (k) = m P\nm ZC (k + mN )\n\nThis is a weighted average over the various sectors allowed by our discretized delta function. If\nthe approximation holds then the average of the\nconserved current should be closed to its exact\nvalue.\n\n\f6\nFor \u03b2 = 5.1, we get the conserved charge\nto be hQ(t)iZ\u0303C = 3.0004(4) for k = 3 and 0\nfor k = 0 and 6. We will first note that for\nk = 3 we get the conserved charge to be very\nclose to the exact value, indicating that there is\nvery little mixing with the other allowed sectors\nk = ...\u221221, \u22129, 15, 27.... The other two values are\n0 due to symmetry. For k = 0 sector, it is easy to\nunderstand. For the k = 6 sector, the explanation lies in the fact that N = 12. Thus for every\nallowed sector k + mN there is an m\u2032 such that\nk + m\u2032 N = \u2212(k + mN ). In that case the sum in\nthe numerator vanishes and the conserved charge\nends up being zero.\nWe conclude that there is very little mixing\nwith the other allowed sectors in our runs. We\nattribute the smallness of the deviation in the\ncase k = 3 to the fact that the free energy for\nour baryons is very large. However, we expect\nthat as we lower the quark mass the deviation\nwill become more significant. If the deviation is\ntoo large then we might have to increase the parameter N for the discrete Fourier transform.\n8. Conclusions and outlook\nSumming up, we showed that the canonical\npartition function approach can be used to investigate the phase structure of QCD. We are able to\nexplore temperatures around the critical temperature and much higher densities than those available by other methods. We also find evidence\nthat sign fluctuations might limit us in reaching\nmuch lower temperature and large fermion number. We checked that the discrete Fourier approximation to the canonical partition function\nintroduces only minimal deviations.\nIn our runs, we find that even for a small\nlattice, the picture that emerges for the phase\nstructure is consistent with expectations. The\nPolyakov loop shows signals of deconfining phase\ntransition both in temperature and density directions. To complement this picture we would like\nto see a signal in the fermionic sector. For this\nwe need to go to smaller masses and, maybe, to\nfiner lattices.\nAnother goal would be to locate certain points\non the phase transition line. For this we need to\n\nget to even lower temperatures and/or densities.\nWhile, we might be limited in going to much lower\ntemperatures, we should be able to reach lower\ndensities.\nTo reach a lower density with larger volume,\nwe need to introduce an esitmator for the determinant. We should stress that the method used\nto generate the modified ensemble has no bearing on whether we have a sign problem or not. It\nis an intrinsic property of the modified ensemble.\nConsequently, we do not expect any difference in\nthe sign behavior as we introduce the estimator.\nREFERENCES\n1. K.F.
