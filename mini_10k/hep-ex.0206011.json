For example, the quark-parton\nmodel took shape in the light of the deep inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments [1] begun at SLAC in the late 1960s. Going even further back, the scattering of energetic \"simple\" \u03b1 particles from the nuclei in a thin gold foil, carried\nout by Geiger and Marsden in Manchester in 1909, led to the concept of the nuclear atom [2, 3] and is clearly analogous to deep inelastic lepton scattering in\nmodern particle physics.\nIn my lectures I first gave an overview before covering one particular area\nin more detail. In the interests of producing a more coherent write-up, I have\nchanged the original order. I first outline the HERA accelerator and detectors\nbefore discussing the theoretical techniques used to derive the basic formulae\nused in the study of electron-quark scattering. Then I give an overview of the\nmain areas of HERA physics, going into somewhat more detail in one particular\narea, that of electron-proton scattering when the interacting quark has a low\nfraction of the original protons momentum, so-called \"low-x\" physics, and related areas such as diffraction. Here, recent theoretical developments and model\nbuilding are changing our perception and improving our understanding of the\nvery rich phenomenology arising from the many different but related channels\nthat can be explored at HERA. I conclude with a discussion of the recent upgrades to both the accelerator and experiments in the HERA II programme and\nthe main areas of physics that they will address.\n\n\u2020 Delivered at 7th Hellenic School on Elementary Particle Physics, Corfu Summer Institute,\nSeptember 2001\n\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n2\n\n2\n\nIntroduction to the HERA machine and experiments\n\nHERA is a unique facility, colliding beams of electrons or positrons with protons at high energy. The protons are accelerated and stored in a ring of superconducting magnets; until 1998 the protons were accelerated to 820 GeV and\nsubsequently to 920 GeV. The electron or positron ring is normal conducting\nand beams are stored at 27.5 GeV. HERA began operation in 1992 and continuously improved its performance in successive years, as illustrated in Fig. 1,\nwhich shows the luminosity delivered to the ZEUS experiment in each year of\nrunning. Because of difficulties with the electron lifetime, the great majority of\ndata has been taken with positron beams; only 32 pb\u22121 of electron data has\nbeen collected by ZEUS compared to a total of 148 pb\u22121 of positron data.\n\nIntegrated Luminosity (pb-1)\n\nHERA luminosity 1992 \u2013 2000\n70\n\n2000\n\n70\n\n60\n\n60\n\n50\n\n50\n\n40\n\n40\n\n1999 e+\n\n30\n\n30\n\n1997\n20\n\n99 e\n\n20\n\n-\n\n1996\n10\n\n1995\n\n1998\n\n10\n\n1994\n\n1993\n15.03.\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nDays of running\n\nFig. 1. The luminosity delivered to the ZEUS detector as a function of days of\nthe run, shown separately for each year of running. A continuous improvement\nin the performance of HERA is evident, except for 1998, in which electrons were\nused rather than positrons.\nThere are two \"general-purpose\" detectors at HERA, H1 and ZEUS. In addition the HERMES experiment uses a gas target to examine polarised electron\nor positron-polarised proton scattering, and the HERA-B detector, designed to\nstudy CP violation in the B sector. The latter two are not discussed further in\nthese lectures due to lack of time. Both H1 and ZEUS have a rather similar configuration, as far as possible enclosing the full solid angle with tracking detectors\nsurrounded by calorimetry. Because of the large asymmetry between the proton\nand positron beam energies, the energy flow is predominantly in the proton, or\n\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n3\n\n\"forward\" direction, so that the detectors are asymmetric, with thicker calorimetery and a higher density of tracking detectors in the forward direction. Figure 2\nshows a diagram of the ZEUS detector, illustrating that its general structure,\nwith the exception of the more complex forward instrumentation, is very typical\nof modern 4\u03c0 detectors, such as those at LEP and the Tevatron.\n\nFig. 2. A vertical section through the ZEUS detector. The black cylinders in\nthe very centre represent the silicon microvertex detector, which was installed in\n2000. Surrounding this are the tracking detectors (CTD, FDET and RTD) and\nsurrounding these are the uranium/scintillator calorimeters (FCAL, RCAL and\nBCAL). These are surrounded by an iron-scintillator backing calorimeter (BAC)\nwhich also acts as a flux return for the superconducting solenoid which surrounds\nthe CTD. Muon chambers (FMUON, with associated toroidal magnets, BMUO\nand RMUO), a Veto Wall to veto off-momentum protons and a concrete shield\ncomplete the detector.\nWith the advent of HERA, the accessible phase space in the kinematic invariants Q2 (the virtuality of the exchanged virtual photon) and x increased\nby approximately three orders of magnitude in each variable compared to what\nwas available at earlier fixed-target experiments (see Fig. 3). This extension in\nkinematic range has opened up qualitatively new fields of study, both at high\nand low Q2 .\nSince HERA is a high-energy lepton-hadron collider, it clearly gives access\nto hard processes in both the strong and electroweak interactions. HERA is very\nsensitive to the production of new particles that can be formed by the fusion\nof leptons and quarks, e.g. leptoquarks or many of the particles predicted by\nR-parity-violating supersymmetry. It is also very sensitive to any small changes\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n4\n\nFig. 3. The kinematic plane in x and Q2 for experiments probing the parton\ndistribution of the proton. The regions explored by each experiment are shown\nin a variety of shadings as shown in the legend. Hadron-hadron collisions are also\nable to measure the proton structure, predominantly at high x and high Q2 .\nin the pattern of the electroweak interaction predicted by the Standard Model.\nSince the colliding leptons are point-like, HERA allows complete control over\nthe conditions of the collision by varying the Q2 , and thereby the size, of the\nprobe. At high Q2 , HERA is a probe of the complex structure of the proton\nvia the point-like coupling of the photon. At low Q2 , the photon becomes large\nand evolves its own complex structure which can be probed using the pointlike interactions between its parton constituents and those of the proton. The\nhadronic nature of the photon under these conditions gives rise to hadron-hadron\ninteractions with large cross sections; by also analysing diffractive interactions,\nin which the proton can be violently struck but remain intact, the rich structure\nand phenomenology of the strong interactions can be explored.\nOne thing that HERA physics cannot do is be simple. Unlike the situation\nin electron-positron annihilation, energy and quantum numbers are transferred\nbetween the colliding particles, each of which has its own conserved quantum\nnumbers of lepton and baryon number. This means that the single annihilation\nenergy necessary to describe most of electron-positron or high-energy hadronhadron collisions is insufficient; two invariants are required. These can be picked\nfrom several different possibilities, the most common of which are x and Q2 .\nOthers include W 2 , the square of the energy of the hadronic final state, s, the\nsquared centre-of-mass energy of the electron-proton system, or y, the inelasticity, which in the rest frame of the proton is the energy transferred from the\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n5\n\nelectron to the proton. Only two of these variables are independent; their definitions are given in Eq. 1 in terms of the initial- and final-state four-vectors of the\nelectron, k and k \u2032 respectively, and the same quantities, p and p\u2032 , for the proton.\n\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\ns\nQ2\n\n=\n=\n\ny\n\n=\n\nW2\n\n=\n\n6\n\n(p + k)2\n\u2212q 2 = \u2212(k \u2032 \u2212 k)2\np*q\np*k\n(p\u2032 )2 = (p + q)2\n\n(1)\n\nEnergy-momentum conservation implies that\nx=\n\nQ2\n2p * q\n\n(2)\n\nso that, ignoring the masses of the lepton and proton:\ny\n\n=\n\nQ2\nsx\n\nW2\n\n=\n\nQ2\n\n(3)\n1\u2212x\nx\n\n(4)\n\nAnother thing that one cannot expect from HERA is to discover the Higgs.\nHERA physics is dominated by the collisions of the lightest quarks with the\nlightest leptons, so that it is the worst place to look for new particles whose\ncouplings are proportional to mass. Neither can HERA produce new particles\nwith mass close to the centre-of-mass energy unless they have the quantum\nnumbers of leptoquarks; a large proportion of the energy must be carried off by\nthe final-state lepton and baryon in the t channel and is not available for the\nproduction of new particles.\nFinally, it cannot be expected that HERA physics will be simple. Many of the\nsimplest problems in QCD have already been studied in detail. The remaining\nones, such as the problem of confinement, are of the highest importance but\nextremely difficult to study in practice, since they manifest themselves in regimes\nin which the strong interaction is really strong.\n\n3\n\nThe formalism of Deep Inelastic Scattering\n\nIt is instructive to remind oneself that the basic formalism of DIS can be relatively easily derived1 from the QED treatment of spin- 21 \u2013 spin- 21 scattering.\nIt is convenient to work in a frame in which the interaction of the virtual photon with the constituents in the proton can be considered as incoherent, i.e.\nthe characteristic time of the \u03b3 \u2217 q interactions is much shorter than any interactions between the partons. A suitable frame is the infinite-momentum frame of\nthe proton, which at HERA can be approximated by the lab. or centre-of-mass\nframe. In such a frame, Lorentz contraction reduces the proton to a \"pancake\"\n1 In my lecturers I spent considerable time in deriving many of the standard DIS equations\nfrom first principles. My approach was based on the use of the Mandelstam variables and\nfollows closely the treatment in Chapters 6 \u2013 10 of Halzen and Martin [4]. Only an outline of\nthe main points is reproduced here.\n\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n7\n\nand time dilation increases the lifetimes of the fluctuating partons so that the\nproton constituents are effectively \"frozen\". Provided that the quarks have negligible effective mass, i.e. have small rest mass and are asymptotically free, and\nthat Q2 \u226a kT2 , then the interactions can be considered incoherent [5].\nThe basic process of an electron scattering incoherently from a quark is now\nidentical to the classic QED calculation of electron-muon scattering. Writing the\ninitial and final four-momenta of the electron as k, k \u2032 and those of the proton as\np, p\u2032 , the standard Feyman rules allow us to write the matrix element as\nM = \u2212e2 u(k \u2032 )\u03b3 \u03bd u(k)\n\n1\nu(p\u2032 )\u03b3\u03bd u(p)\nq2\n\n(5)\n\nUsing standard trace techniques and ignoring mass terms leads to\n2\n\n|M| =\n\n8e4\n[(k \u2032 * p\u2032 )(k * p) + [(k \u2032 * p)(k * p\u2032 )]\n(k \u2212 k \u2032 )4\n\n(6)\n\nIt is very convenient to use the Mandelstam variables, s, t and u, since not only\ncan they easily be evaluated in any frame, but also there are several useful\nrelations between them and the more usual DIS variables of Eq. 1 that simplify\nthe algebra.

Equation 22 also implies that F2 is a function of x only, a phenomenon known as \"scaling\". This was clearly observed in the original SLAC experiments, as shown in\nFig. 4 and is also clearly visible in the HERA data shown in Fig. 5 at similar\n\nFig. 4. The \u03bdW2 (\u2261 F2 ) structure function at \u03c9 = 1/x = 4 as a function of Q2\nas measured by the SLAC-MIT group [7]. Data taken at four different scattering\nangles are shown. All data is consistent with being independent of Q2 .\nvalues of x. However, when one looks at other values of x, it is clear that scaling\nbecomes progressively more and more violated.\nThe phenomenon of scaling violation is one of the clearest manifestations of\nQuantum Chromodynamics and is caused by gluon radiation from the struck\nquark. This radiation is accompanied by a transfer of energy to the emitted\ngluon, which leads to a shift of the average quark x to lower values. The emitted\ngluon can also split into further quark-antiquark pairs which are also at low x.\nThus, since the gluon bremsstrahlung depends on Q2 , the cross section develops\na strong Q2 and x dependence. This can conveniently be taken into account by\nre-writing Eq. 20 as a function of x and Q2 using the Jacobian, (s + u)/x, as\n\"\n#\n2\n(s + u)\n2\u03c0\u03b12\nu\nd2 \u03c3\n2\n2\n2\n=\nxF1 (x, Q ) \u2212 2 F2 (x, Q )\ndxdQ2\nxQ4\ns\ns\n=\n\n\u0003\n2\u03c0\u03b12 \u0002\n2xy 2 F1 + 2(1 \u2212 y)F2 ,\n4\nxQ\n\n(23)\n\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n10\n\nZEUS 96/97\n\n4\n\nH1 96/97\n\nem\n\nF 2 -log10 x\n\nZEUS+H1\nH1 94/00 Prel.\n\nNMC, BCDMS, E665\nZEUS NLO QCD Fit\n\n3.5\n\n(prel. 2001)\nH1 NLO QCD Fit\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n4\n\n10 2\n2\nQ (GeV )\n\nFig. 5.

This sensitivity has been exploited by both ZEUS and H1.\nEach experiment has made a global QCD fit to its own data plus some or all of\nthe fixed-target DIS data.

The quality of\nthe fits in both experiments is excellent, as demonstrated by the curves shown\nin Figs. 5 - 7. The results for the density of the gluon are shown in Fig. 8.\nI now use the ZEUS NLOQCD fit to illustrate some points of interest. Figure 9 illustrates the evolution of the gluon density and that of the sea as a\nfunction of Q2 . While at medium Q2 the sea density lies below that of the gluon\nand follows its shape, at low Q2 it is higher than the gluon. This makes the\nnormal interpretation, that the sea is driven by gluon splitting, rather difficult\nto maintain.\nFigure 10 shows that FL also begins to behave strangely at low Q2 , becoming\nvery flat and at the lowest values of Q2 becoming negative, although the size of\nthe uncertainties still allow it in principle to remain positive.

However, it is not an observable, whereas\nFL is, so that the tendency for FL to become negative at low Q2 implies a breakdown in the QCD paradigm. We will return to this discussion in Section 5.3. The\nquality of the HERA data is now so high that it alone can give constraints on\nthe parton densities scarcely less good than the fits that include also fixed-target\nand other data. However, it is necessary to make\nsome simplifying assumptions, particularly for the high-x valence behaviour,\nin such fits. The results are illustrated in Fig. 11, which shows the gluon density\narising from such a fit, with its associated uncertainty band, in comparison with\nthe result from the standard fit; the general behaviour is similar, with a somewhat\nlarger uncertainty, particularly at low Q2 .\n4.3\n\nThe determination of \u03b1s at HERA\n\nAnother output of the NLOQCD fit is a value of \u03b1s ; the results from the two experiments are shown in Fig. 12, labelled as \"NLO-QCD fit\".

The mass difference between the D\u2217\ncandidate and the D candidate can therefore be measured very accurately, allowing sufficient suppression of the combinatorial background that the charm signal\ncan be cleanly identified. The structure function can then be unfolded from the\nmeasured differential cross section using models to correct for the unmeasured\nparts of the phase space. The measurements of the semi-inclusive charm structure function, F2c , made by both experiments [14, 15] using this technique are\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n17\n\nFig. 11.

This can certainly in principle be accomplished by reducing the\nbeam energies in HERA. However, the practical difficulties for the experiments\nand the accelerator inherent in reducing either the proton or electron beam energy, or both, by a factor sufficient to permit an accurate measurement of FL\nmean that it has not to date been attempted.

Unfortunately, the acceptance of the luminosity taggers\ntypically used to detect such photons is sufficiently small and understanding the\nacceptance sufficiently difficult that no result has been obtained as yet.\nIn the absence of any direct determination, the H1 collaboration has used\nevents at very large values of y to make an indirect measurement of FL . The\ndeterminations of F2 rely on the fact that most of the measurements are made\nat values of y sufficiently small that the effects of FL are negligible; at higher y,\na QCD estimate of FL , which is normally a small fraction of F2 , is subtracted.\nThe H1 collaboration inverts this procedure by isolating kinematic regions in\nwhich the contribution of FL is maximised and then subtracts off an estimate of\nF2 extrapolated from lower y.\nThe method used by H1 employs the derivatives of the reduced cross section\nwith respect to ln y.

The curve is the result of an NLO\nQCD fit to the H1 data deriving from the F2 determination, i.e. by deriving the\ngluon and quark distributions from scaling violations and then calculating FL\nusing QCD. The QCD prediction is in good agreement with the H1 estimate.\n\n5\n\nDeep inelastic scattering at low x\n\nUntil now we have concentrated on hard processes, in which Q2 has been large\nand where QCD has shown itself to be applicable. However, the data, in partichttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n22\n\nular the ZEUS \"BPT\" data [20], give access to very low Q2 and x regimes, in\nwhich the strong interaction becomes very strong and perturbative QCD would\nbe expected to break down. This kinematic region has traditionally been understood in terms of Regge theory. The study of how and where the transition\nbetween these two regimes occurs is very interesting, not only intrinsically but\nalso because of the insight it gives us into links between the apparently rather\ndifferent processes of diffraction and deep inelastic scattering. In addition, the\naccess given to very low values of x at these small Q2 in principle gives sensitivity\nto the mechanism of QCD evolution. Given the steep rise in the parton densities\nas x falls, the data at the lowest x values may also be sensitive to high-density\neffects, such as parton recombination, sometimes known as saturation.\n5.1\n\nQCD evolution\n\nWe assume that the parton distribution functions, f , satisfy the schematic equation:\n\u2202f\n\u03b1s (\u03bc2 )\n\u223c\n* (f \u2297 P)\n(42)\n\u2202 ln \u03bc2\n2\u03c0\nwhere \u03bc represents the renormalisation scale and P is a 'splitting function' that\ndescribes the probability of a given parton splitting into two others. This equation is known as the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) Equation [21, 22, 23, 24]. There are four distinct Altarelli-Parisi (AP) splitting functions representing the 4 possible 1 \u2192 2 splittings and referred to as Pqq , Pgq , Pqg\nand Pgg . The calculation of the splitting functions in perturbative QCD in Eq. 42\nrequires approximations, both in order of terms which can be taken into account\nas well as the most important kinematic variables. The generic form for the\nsplitting functions can be shown to be [25]:\n#\n\" n\n\u001a \u0012 \u0013\u001bm\n\u221e \u0010\nX\n\u03b1s \u0011n X (n)\n1\n(n)\n(43)\nxP(x, \u03b1s ) =\n+ xP (x)\nAm ln\n2\u03c0\nx\nn=0\nm=0\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nwhere P (x) are the x-finite parts of the AP splitting functions and Am are\nnumerical coefficients which can in principle be calculated for each splitting\nfunction. In the axial gauge, leading ln Q2 terms arise from evolution along the\nparton chain that is strongly ordered in transverse momentum, i.e.\n2\n2\nQ2 \u226b kt,n\n\u226b kt,n\u22121\n\u226b ...\n\nLeading-order DGLAP evolution sums up (\u03b1s ln Q2 )n terms, while NLO sums\nup \u03b1s (\u03b1s ln Q2 )n\u22121 terms, which arise when two adjacent transverse momenta\nbecome comparable, losing a factor of ln Q2 .\nIn some kinematic regions, and in particular at low x, it must become essential to sum leading terms in ln 1/x independent of the value of ln Q2 . This is done\nby the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov [26, 27, 28, 29] (BFKL) equation, which\ngoverns the evolution in x at fixed Q2 . The leading-order terms in (\u03b1s ln 1/x)n\narise from strong ordering in x, i.e.\nx \u226a xn \u226a xn\u22121 \u226a . . .\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n23\n\nOne of the most important goals of HERA physics is the search for experimental\neffects that can be unambiguously attributed to BFKL evolution.\nGenerally, however, QCD coherence implies angular ordering. To see the implications of this it is more convenient to work with unintegrated parton density\nfunctions, f (x, kt2 , \u03bc2 ), where \u03bc is the scale of the probe. There are now two\nhard scales, kt and complicated QCD evolution, known as the Ciafaloni, Catani,\nFiorani and Marchesini [30, 31, 32] (CCFM) evolution equation. The DGLAP\nand BFKL equations can then be seen to be two limits of angular ordering. In\nthe DGLAP collinear approximation, the branching angle, \u03b8, where \u03b8 \u223c kt /kl ,\ngrows since kt grows; while for BFKL evolution, \u03b8 grows because kl \u221d x falls.\nFigure 16 shows the ln 1/x - ln Q2 plane at HERA, together with schematic\nindications of the directions in which GLAP, BFKL and CCFM evolution is\nexpected to be most applicable. Also indicated on the figure are schematic in-\n\nFig. 16. Schematic diagram showing different regions of the ln 1/x and ln Q2\nplane and the evolution equations expected to hold therein.

The 'size' of partons is also indicated in differing\nkinematic regions.\ndications of both the 'size' and density of partons in the proton in different\nkinematic regions.\nThe transverse size of the partons that can be resolved by a probe with\nvirtuality Q2 is proportional to 1/Q, so that the area of the partonic 'dots' in\nFig. 16 falls as Q2 rises. For particular combinations of parton size and density,\nthe proton will eventually become 'black' to probes, or, equivalently, the component gluons will become so dense that they will begin to recombine. The dotted\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n24\n\nline labelled 'Critical line - GLR' refers to the boundary beyond which it is expected that such parton saturation effects will become important, i.e. the region\nin which partons become so densely crowded that interactions between them\nreduce the growth in parton density predicted by the linear GLAP and BFKL\nevolution equations. The parton evolution in this region can be described by the\nGribov-Levin-Riskin [33, 34] equation, which explicitly takes into account an\nabsorptive term in the gluon evolution equation. Naively, it can be assumed [35]\nthat the gluons inside the proton each occupies on average a transverse area of\n\u03c0Q\u22122 , so that the total transverse area occupied by gluons is proportional to\nthe number density multiplied by this area, i.e. \u03c0Q\u22122 xg(x, Q2 ). Since the gluon\ndensity increases quickly as x falls, and the gluon 'size' increases as Q\u22121 , in the\nregion in which both x and Q2 are small, saturation effects ought to become\nimportant. This should occur when the size occupied by the partons becomes\nsimilar to the size of the proton:\nxg(x, Q2 )\n\n\u03c0\n= \u03c0R2\nQ2\n\n(44)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the proton, (\u223c 1 fm \u223c 5 GeV\u22121 ). The measured values\nof xg(x, Q2 ) imply that saturation ought to be observable at HERA [36] at low\nx and Q2 , although the values of Q2 which satisfy Eq. 44 are sufficiently small\nthat possible non-perturbative and higher-twist effects certainly complicate the\nsituation. Of course,\nit is also possible that the assumption of homogenous gluon density is incorrect; for example, the gluon density may be larger in the close vicinity of\nthe valence quarks, giving rise to so-called 'hot spots' [37], which could lead to\nsaturation being observable at smaller distances and thereby larger Q2 .\n5.2\n\nInterpretation and Models\n\nThe region of low Q2 and low x is one in which perturbative QCD meets and\ncompetes with a large variety\nof other approaches, some based on QCD, others either on older paradigms\nsuch as Regge theory or essentially ad-hoc phenomenological models. In a previous article [38] I gave a quite detailed review of these models, and given that\nthere have not been major developments here, I refer the reader to that for\nfurther information.\n5.3\n\nQCD fits\n\nThe extension of the kinematic range and the high-precision data on F2 from\nHERA provided a substantial impetus to the determination of parton distribution functions via global fits to a wide variety of data. The major current\napproaches are due to the CTEQ group [39] and Martin et al. (MRST) [40].\nIn general both groups fit to data from fixed target muon and neutrino deep\ninelastic scattering data, the HERA DIS data from HERMES, H1 and ZEUS,\nthe W -asymmetry data from the Tevatron as well as to selected process varying from group to group such as prompt photon data from Fermilab as well as\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n25\n\nhigh-ET jet production at the Tevatron. The different data sets give different\nsensitivity to the proton distributions, depending on the kinematic range, but\ntogether constrain them across almost the whole kinematic plane, with the possible exception of the very largest values of x, where significant uncertainties still\nremain [41].\nThe approaches of CTEQ and MRST are basically similar, although they differ both in the data sets used as well as in the fitting procedure and the technical\ndetails of the theoretical tools used, e.g. the treatment of heavy quarks in DIS.\nIn their latest fits, CTEQ prefer to omit the prompt photon data because of the\nuncertainties in scale dependence and the appropriate value for the intrinsic kT\nrequired to fit the data. Instead they use single-jet inclusive ET distributions to\nconstrain the gluon distribution at large x. In contrast, until their most recent\npublications, MRST retained the prompt photon data, giving alternative PDFs\ndepending on the value for the prompt-photon intrinsic kT used. Both groups\nparameterise the parton distributions in terms of powers of x and (1 \u2212 x) leading to fits with many free parameters. The MRST NLO parameterisation of the\ngluon is shown below as an example:\nxg\n\n\u221a\n= Ag x\u2212\u03bbg (1 \u2212 x)\u03b7g (1 + \u01ebg x + \u03b3g x)\n\n(45)\n\nwhere Ag , \u03bbg , \u03b7g , \u01ebg and \u03b3g are free parameters in the fit.\nThe seminal work of Botje in producing PDFs with associated error matrices\nfor the first time [42] has led to similar fits being produced by other groups.\nCTEQ [43] have produced a global fit with associated errors, while both H1 [44]\nand ZEUS [45] have produced their own fits using DIS data only, as discussed\nin Section 4.2.\nThese fits allow one to see very graphically the salient features of the QCD\nevolution that have been discussed above. For example, the ZEUS NLOQCD fit\nshown in Fig. 9 has already been discussed in Section 4.2. Here we saw that the\nstrange behaviour both of the gluon vs. sea densities, as well as FL , as a function\nof Q2 showed that the normal QCD interpretation may well be breaking down\nat Q2 around 1 GeV2 .\nOne possible reason for the problems with the interpretation of the NLO QCD\nfits could be the need for higher-order QCD fits i.e. next-to-next-to-leading-order\n(NNLO) fits. The first steps in implementing such fits have already begun; some\nmoments of the NNLO splitting functions have been calculated [46]. Using this\nwith other available information, van Neerven and Vogt [47, 48] have produced\nanalytical expressions for the splitting functions which represent the slowest and\nfastest evolution consistent with the currently available information. The MRST\ngroup has recently used this information to investigate NNLO fits to the available\ndata [49]. Such an analysis requires some changes to the parameterisations used,\nso that for example the NLO parameterisation of the gluon of Eq. 45 becomes:\n\u221a\n\u2032\n\u2032\nxg(x, Q20 ) = Ag x\u2212\u03bbg (1 \u2212 x)\u03b7g (1 + \u03b5g x + \u03b3g x) \u2212 A\u2032g x\u2212\u03bbg (1 \u2212 x)\u03b7g , (46)\nprimarily in order to facilitate a negative gluon density at low x and low Q2 ,\nwhich, as we have seen, is preferred by the fits, even at NLO.

The MRST 'central' NNLO fit to DIS data. The solid line shows the\nNNLO fit, while the NLO fit is shown by the dashed line and the LO fit by the\ndotted line. The data are from H1, ZEUS and the fixed target experiments and\nare plotted in x bins as a function of Q2 with an additive constant added to the\ndata of each x bin to improve visibility.\n'central' fit, between the extremes of the van Neerven-Vogt parameterisation, is\nshown in Fig. 17.\nThere are also changes of the LO and NLO fits with respect to earlier publications, in as much as MRST now follow CTEQ in using the Tevatron high-ET\ndata rather than the prompt-photon data, and HERA F2 data has been included\nin the fit. There is a marked improvement in the quality of the fit in the progression LO \u2192 NLO \u2192 NNLO, in particular in terms of the NMC data. The\nsize of higher-twist contributions at low x also decreases, so that at NNLO is it\nessentially negligible. The effect of going to NNLO on the PDFs themselves is\nhighly non-trivial. This is illustrated in Fig. 18, where the quite major changes\nin FL , particularly at low x, are evident. There is also a large variation depending on the choices made in the parameter space allowed by the partial NNLO\nansatz. Indeed, the GLAP approach is not convergent for Q2 < 5 GeV2 , which\nmay well be due to the neglect of important ln 1/x contributions. However, the\ninstability seen at low Q2 soon vanishes at higher Q2 .\n\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n0.5\n\n27\n\n0.5\n\nQ2=2 GeV2\n0.4\n\n2\n\nFL(x,Q )\n\nQ2=5 GeV2\n\nNNLO (average)\nNNLO (extremes)\nNLO\nLO\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n0\n1\n\n0.5\n2\n\nQ =20 GeV\n\n2\n\nFL(x,Q )\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n2\n\n2\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\nx\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n2\n\nQ =100 GeV\n\n0.4\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\nx\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n1\n\nFig. 18.

Since the logarithmic\nderivative of F2 is directly proportional to the gluon density in leading-order\nQCD, which in turn is the dominant parton density at small x, its behaviour\nas a function of both x and Q2 is important.

The dotted\nlines on Fig. 20 are lines of constant W . The curious 'bulging' shape of these\ncontours in the small-x region immediately implies that something interesting is\ngoing on there. Indeed, simple inspection of Fig. 20 shows that the slope of F2\nat constant W begins flat in the scaling region, increases markedly as the gluon\ngrows and drives the evolution of F2 and then flattens off again at the lowest x.\n\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n30\n\nFigure 21 shows the logarithmic derivative evaluated at (x, Q2 ) points along\nthe contours of fixed W shown on Fig. 20 according to the derivative of Eq. 48,\nviz.:\n\u2202F2\n= B(x) + 2C(x) log10 Q2 ,\n(49)\n\u2202 log10 Q2\nwhere the data are plotted separately as functions of ln Q2 and ln x.

Within the framework of pQCD,\nthe interpretation of such an effect is that the growth of the gluon density at\nlow x is tamed as Q2 and x fall. This behaviour can also be seen more clearly\nin Fig. 22, which shows a three-dimensional plot of the derivatives as a function\nof both ln x and ln Q2 , obtained from a parameterisation of the DIS data.\nSuch an effect is by no means necessarily an indication of deviations from\nthe standard DGLAP evolution. It can be seen from Fig. 22 that, for example,\nno turnover effect occurs in bins of constant Q2 . Nevertheless, the features of\nFigs. 21 and 22 can be explained as a natural consequence of parton saturation\nor shadowing. These effects can be naturally discussed in \"dipole models\" [38],\nwhich often explicitly take into account parton-saturation effects. In such models,\nthe \"standard\" picture of deep inelastic scattering in the infinite-momentum\nframe of the proton is replaced by an equivalent picture produced by a Lorentz\nboost into the proton rest frame. In this frame, the virtual photon undergoes\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n+\n\n31\n\n\bF2\n\blog10 Q2\n1.8\nHERA kin. limit\n+\u0011\u0011\n\n1.2\n0.6\n210\n\n0 85\n-6\n30\n-5\n-4\n\nlog10 x\n\n50\n\n1\n\n(W in GeV)\n\n0\n-2-1\n\n3\n\n2\n\n14\n\n-3\n\n130\n\nlog10Q2\n2 in GeV2 )\n\n(Q\n\nFig. 22.

The dominant configurations of this structure are qq and qqg Fock\nstates, which interact with the proton as a colour dipole. The higher the Q2 of\nthe interaction, the smaller the transverse size of the dipole. For small x, the deep\ninelastic process can be considered semi-classically as the coherent interaction\nof the dipole with the stationary colour field of the proton a long time after\nthe formation of the dipole. As an example, the model of Golec-Biernat and\nW\u00fcsthoff (GBW) [52, 53] is shown in Fig. 23, together with the results of the\nZEUS NLOQCD fit.\nIt can be seen that the GBW model reproduces the basic features of the logarithmic derivative plot reasonably well. However, so does the ZEUS NLOQCD\nfit, so that no firm conclusion can be drawn on the existence or otherwise of\nsaturation effects.\n+\n\n6\n\n+\n\nDiffraction\n\nDiffractive DIS is that subset characterised by a hard interaction between the\nproton and the exchanged virtual photon that nevertheless leaves the proton\nintact. Such interactions are normally thought of in Regge theory as proceeding\nvia the exchange of a colourless particle with the quantum numbers of the vacuum, known as the Pomeron. The Pomeron under some circumstances can be\nconsidered to develop its own partonic structure, analogous to the proton, which\ncan be parameterised using diffractive DIS data.\nOne of the most attractive features of dipole models such as that of GBW\ndiscussed in the previous section is the rather natural way in which they can lead\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n32\n\nFig. 23. The logarithmic derivatives of the ZEUS F2 data as shown in Fig. 21.\nThe dotted curves show the predictions of the BGW model for the five highest W\nbins; since these predictions do not include QCD evolution effects, they should\nbecome progressively less accurate as Q2 increases. The solid curves show the\npredictions of the ZEUS NLO QCD fit for all W bins; they are only shown down\nto Q2 \u223c 3 GeV2 .\nto a unified description of diffraction and deep inelastic scattering. The QCD interpretation of the Pomeron is that it is equivalent to the exchange of two gluons\nin a colour-singlet state. In this picture, therefore, diffraction can be considered\nas a subset of fully inclusive DIS, which sums over all possible exchanges between\nthe dipole and the proton, dominantly one- and two-gluon exchange in a colour\noctet, in contrast to the colour-singlet exchange that dominates inclusive DIS.\nThis deep connection between these two processes leads to non-trivial predictions which do indeed seem to be at least qualitatively in agreement with the\ndata. This is illustrated in Fig. 24. This figure is surprising for several reasons.\nIt demonstrates that the diffractive cross section has the same W dependence as\nthe total cross section. To the extent to which the diffractive cross section can\nbe related to the elastic cross section, one would have expected from the Optical\nTheorem that the ratio would have a power-law dependence on W , as indeed\nwould also be expected from Regge theory via the exchange of a Pomeron.

The ratio of the diffractive to total cross section in four Q2 bins as\na function of W . The curves show the predictions from the Golec-Biernat &\nWusthoff model.\nstrong W (\u223c 1/x) dependence is also expected in QCD models, since the total cross section is dominated by single-gluon exchange, whereas diffraction is\ndominated by two-gluon exchange. The other surprise is the fact that the GBW\nmodel gives a rather good qualitative representation of the data.\nZEUS has also investigated the behaviour of this ratio as Q2 \u2192 0 [54]. FigD(3)\nure 25 shows the diffractive structure function, xIP F2\n(the analogue to F2 ,\nintegrated over t) multiplied by xIP , the fraction of the protons momentum carried by the Pomeron, as a function of Q2 in various bins of W and in two bins\nD(3\nof MX , the mass of the hadronic system other than the proton. The F2\ndata\npoints are determined using two methods, one of which requires the observation\nof a large rapidity gap in the proton-beam direction, while the other uses the\nZEUS Leading Proton Spectrometer (LPS) [55]. This device is an array of six\nstations of silicon-strip detectors placed in Roman pots downstream of the interaction point in the proton beam direction. It uses the HERA beam elements\nto form a magnetic spectrometer to analyse the leading proton from diffractive\ninteractions. Although its acceptance is of necessity small, it avoids the low-mass\nproton dissociative background endemic with other forms of identifying diffractive interactions. The similarity of Fig. 25 to Fig. 19 is striking, again illustrating\nthe Q\u22122 falloff enforced by electromagnetic current conservation.\n\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n34\n\nD(3)\n\nFig. 25. xIP F2\nin bins of W and MX as a function of Q2 .

Figure 26 shows the photoproduction\ncross sections for a variety of vector mesons as a function of W , as well as the\ntotal cross section. The relatively slow rise of the total cross section with Q2 is\nindicative of the dominance of soft processes. The J/\u03c8 cross section clearly has\na much steeper rise with Q2 . This is more clearly seen in Fig. 27, where the cross\nsection for several different Q2 is shown as a function of W . It would appear that\nthe mass of the J/\u03c8 is sufficiently large that it gives rise to a hard scale even at\nQ2 \u223c 0.\nIn contrast, the mass of the \u03c1 is small and quite large values of Q2 need\nto be reached before the W dependence rises to the values associated with hard\nprocesses. This can be seen in Fig. 28, which shows the values of the fit to a power\nlaw in W as a function of Q2 . An appropriately hard scale seems to pertain for\nQ2 > 5.\nThis behaviour, in which either Q2 or the mass can act as a hard scale, leads\nto the obvious question of whether a combination of these two quantities can\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fR.

There is indeed a tendency for\nthe data for all the vector mesons to lie on a universal curve. However, other\nmore detailed comparisons [57] show that some differences do remain between\nthe different species even when plotted against Q2 + M 2 .\nTo the extent that we can model diffraction by the exchange of a colourless\ntwo-gluon state, we would expect a difference between the W dependence of\nvector meson production and inclusive DIS. This is illustrated in Fig. 29 shows\nthe values of fits to the W -dependence of the inclusive DIS and vector-meson\ncross sections against Q2 and Q2 + M 2 , respectively. For Q2 + M 2 greater than\nabout 5 GeV2 , the value of \u03b4 is indeed about twice that at the same value of\nQ2 in inclusive DIS, as would be expected in the simple picture of two-gluon\nexchange.\nProvided that we have a scale sufficiently hard that pQCD is applicable,\nwe can also use vector meson production to probe the gluon density in the\nproton.

The inset shows\nthe \u03b4 obtained from these fits as a function of Q2 .\nsuch a determination should in principle be much more sensitive to the gluon\ndensity than, for example, scaling violations in deep inelastic scattering. This is\nillustrated in Fig. 30, which shows ZEUS and H1 data for J/\u03c8 photoproduction\nas a function of W . We have seen already that the J/\u03c8 mass is sufficiently large\nto guarantee that pQCD is applicable even in photoproduction. The quality of\nthe data is sufficiently high that it is in principle sensitive to the gluon density.\nUnfortunately, the wave-function of the J/\u03c8 must be modelled, which leads to\nsubstantial uncertainty in the model predictions, so that this data has not as\nyet been used in global fits to constrain the gluon density. The good agreement\nbetween at least some version of the models and the data, as shown in Fig. 30,\ndoes however indicate that the gluon determined in the global fits to DIS data is\nindeed also able to explain the dynamics of this completely different diffractive\nprocess.\nFinally, it is interesting to investigate whether t can also provide a hard scale\nfor pQCD.

The ratio of the cross sections for \u03c6 and\n\u03c1 starts somewhat below the SU (4) expectation but reaches it quite quickly, by\n\u2212t \u223c 3 \u2212 4 GeV2 . In contrast, the J/\u03c8 ratio remains below the SU (4) prediction\nfor much longer, hardly reaching it even for \u2212t \u223c 6 GeV2 . Figure 31 shows\nthe ZEUS data for all three vector mesons as a function of \u2212t compared to\na two-gluon exchange model and to a model in which a BFKL gluon ladder\nis exchanged [60]. It can be seen that the two-gluon model completely fails to\nreproduce the data both in magnitude and in shape, whereas the BFKL model,\nwhich has been fit to the ZEUS data, gives an excellent fit for all three mesons.\nAlthough some of the model assumptions, such as a fixed \u03b1s and a \u03b4-function\nwave-function for the light vector mesons, are somewhat questionable, the fact\nthat this BFKL model fits the data whereas conventional pQCD fails is very\nstriking. It can thus be concluded that t does form an appropriate hard scale\nfor pQCD calculations. However, the ratios of ZEUS vector-meson cross sections\nbehave differently as a function of t compared to Q2 , so that either these ratios\nare different at asymptotic values of the two variables, or t and Q2 are not\nequivalent hard scales.\n6.2\n\nDeeply virtual Compton scattering\n\nDeeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) is an interesting process in that it\nis the simplest possible non-elastic diffractive process.

As such, no fragmentation or hadronic wave-functions complicate\nthe process. The Bethe-Heitler QED process also leads to the same final state,\nwhich is both a blessing and a curse. The curse is that is necessary to separate\nthe two processes; the blessing is that the fact of identical final states leads to\ninterference. Since the amplitude and phase of the QED process is calculable,\nin principle this opens the door to the determination of the unknown QCD\namplitude that governs DVCS. However, we are still some considerable distance\nfrom this goal.\nGiven that a virtual photon participates in the collision with the parton\nin the proton and that it emerges on mass shell, it is clear that the scattered\nparton that must be re-integrated into the final-state proton must undergo a\nchange in its four-momentum corresponding to a change in its x value. Thus the\nDVCS process is sensitive to the so-called \"skewed parton distributions inside\nthe proton, which can be thought of as the cross-correlation function between\npartons of fractional momentum x1 and x2 . Thus much unique information can\nbe obtained by studying these processes.\nThe DVCS process was first seen at HERA by ZEUS [61]. The H1 collaboration has published results on the observation of this process and the first\nmeasurement of the cross section [62]. The background from the Bethe-Heitler\nprocess can be subtracted by utilising the kinematic characteristics of the two\nprocesses. In DVCS, the photon is normally produced at a large angle to the\nincident beam directions and the positron at a small angle, whereas, for the\n\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n39\n\nZEUS\n\u03c3\u03b3p \u2192 J/\u03c8p (nb)\n\n\u03c3\u03b3p \u2192 J/\u03c8p (nb)\n\nZEUS\n225\nZEUS 96-97 J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bc\n+ ZEUS 99-00 J/\u03c8 \u2192 e e\nH1\nE401\nE516\n\n+ -\n\n200\n175\n150\n\n225\n+ -\n\n175\n150\n\n125\n\n125\n\n100\n\n100\n\n75\n\n75\n\n50\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nFMS (CTEQ4L, \u03bb=4)\nMRT (CTEQ5M)\nMRT (MRST99)\nGBW double Gaussian\n\n50\n\n\u03b4\n\nW fit to ZEUS data\n\u03b4 = 0.69 \u00b1 0.02 (stat.) \u00b1 0.03 (syst.)\n\n25\n\nZEUS 96-97 J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc \u03bc\n+ ZEUS 99-00 J/\u03c8 \u2192 e e\n\n200\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nW (GeV)\n\n25\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nW (GeV)\n\nFig. 30. a) The ZEUS and H1 data on J/\u03c8 photoproduction, together with the\ndata from two fixed target experiments as a function of W .

As more\ndata is collected, the possibility of using this process to determine skewed parton\ndistributions will make it a fruitful area of study at HERA II.\nThere are many more areas of diffraction, in particular the diffractive structure functions, which I have not been able to cover.

The ZEUS collaboration has made several contributions to\ncharm spectroscopy results: as an example, Fig. 33 shows the D\u2217 \u03c0 spectrum\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n40\n\nZEUS\nZEUS 1996-97\nForshaw\nPoludniowski\n\n10\n1\n\n(a)\n\n-1\n\n\u03b3 p \u2192 \u03c1Y\n\n10\n\nd\u03c3/dt (nb/GeV 2)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n10\n1\n-1\n\n(b)\n\n10\n0\n\n\u03b3 p \u2192 \u03c6Y\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n4\n\n6\n\n10\n1\n(c)\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u03b3 p \u2192 J/\u03a8 Y\n\n2\n\n2\n\n-t (GeV )\n\nFigure 8:\nThe measured di erential ross se tions d\u001b p!V Y =dt (symbols) for\n(a) \u001a0 , (b) \u001e, and ( ) J= photoprodu tion in the range 80 < W < 120 GeV and\n\nFig. 031.\nZEUS\ndata\nvector-meson\nproduction\nat[16\u2104.\nhighThe\n\u2212t.inner\nThe bars\ncurve\n:01 The\n< x\n^ <\n1.

A rather complex set of structures can be observed\nbetween 2.4 and 2.5 GeV, some of which correspond to known resonances and\nsome of which do not. Work continues36to understand this complex area; the\nsensitivity of ZEUS in this sort of investigation is similar to that of the LEP\nexperiments and CLEO.\nBoth H1 and ZEUS have observed beauty production in photoproduction;\nH1 has also published a cross section in DIS. The identification of the b signal\nis based on the use of high-transverse-momentum leptons for ZEUS; H1 also use\ntracks with large impact parameter as measured in their silicon vertex detector.\nThe results as a function of Q2 are shown in Fig. 34. It can be seen that the QCD\npredictions are substantially below the data for all Q2 , thus joining a pattern\nalso seen in proton-antiproton and photon-photon collisions. The tendency for\npQCD to fail to predict B cross sections, which naively would be thought to be\nan area in which it should work well, is becoming increasingly interesting. The\nadvent of HERA II will make an enormous difference to the precision of this type\nof measurement and should allow a stringent test of the theory of heavy-quark\nproduction.\n\n8\n\nHigh-Q2 phenomena\n\nHERA provides an unique opportunity to study the electroweak interaction at\nQ2 sufficiently high that the charged and neutral currents are of similar strength.\n\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\f41\n\nH1\n\nZEUS\n\n10\n\nd\u03c3/dQ2(pb/GeV2)\n\nDVCS (FFS)\nDVCS (DD)\n\nW = 75 GeV\n2\n| t | < 1 GeV\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03c3 \u03b3 p\u2192 \u03b3 p [nb]\n\nEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n10\n\n1\n10\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\nZEUS (prel.) 96-97 e+p\nGenDVCS (FFS)\n(elastic only)\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\nQ\n\n10\n\n15\n\n2\n\n[ GeV ]\n\n-3\n\n\u03b3\nET\n\n20\n\n> 3 GeV\n\n-0.6 < \u03b7\u03b3 < 1\n\n2\n\n40 GeV < W < 140 GeV\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n2\n\n2\n\nQ (GeV )\n\nFig. 32. a) The cross section for deeply virtual Compton scattering as a function\nof Q2 as measured by the H1 collaboration.

For e+ p interactions, the charged current cross-section approaches the\nneutral current cross-section, but remains below it.

Secondly, the\n(1 \u2212 y)2 terms in Eqs. 50 and 51, which arise from the V \u2212 A helicity structure\nof the charged weak current, imply that the valence-quark contribution, which\nis dominant at high Q2 , is suppressed for the positron case but not for electrons.\nThe difference between the electron and positron neutral current cross sections shown in Eq. 26 allows the determination of the parity-violating structure\nfunction xF3 by taking the difference of the cross sections. The results [66] are\nshown in Fig. 36. Since its determination requires the subtraction of two quantities that are almost equal, it is dominated by statistical uncertainties, which\nare in turn dominated by the fact that the electron data sample that has so far\nbeen obtained at HERA is much smaller than that for positrons.\nThe high-Q2 regime is also interesting since possible new states from electronquark fusion (e.g. leptoquarks) have masses given by M 2 \u223c sx and since the\nsensitivity to the effects of new currents is maximised. An example of the sensitivity that can be obtained at HERA is shown in Fig. 37, which shows the mass\nagainst coupling limits for two varieties of scalar leptoquark. Both H1 and ZEUS\nhave comparable limits for a whole range of such states with differing quantum\nnumbers. It can be seen from Fig. 37, and it is generally the case, that for some\nstates, in particular in R-parity-violating supersymmetry models or leptoquarks,\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n\u03c3\n\nData / Theory\n\nvis\n\n6\n5\n\n43\n\n(ep \u2192 b X)\n\nH1 \u03bc pTrel\nH1 \u03bc impact param.

The band shows the uncertainty on the\npredictions of perturbative QCD.\nHERA has higher sensitivity than either LEP or the Tevatron.\nLimits on excited leptons and quarks have also been obtained by ZEUS and\nH1, which extend the limits from the LEP experiments considerably beyond the\nLEP II centre-of-mass energy.\nAs well as stringent limits on new phenomena, the HERA data also show\nintriguing features which may be signatures for new physics. The H1 collaboration has observed a class of events that have isolated charged leptons with\nlarge missing transverse momentum. Figure 38 shows the distribution of the\ntransverse momentum of the hadronic system, pX\nT , against its transverse mass,\nseparately for electrons (or positrons) and muons in such events. Also shown are\nthe expectations from the Standard Model background, which is dominated by\nsingle W production.\nIt can be seen that the distribution of the events is rather different to\nthe Standard Model expectation. Furthermore, for the transverse mass of the\nhadronic system greater than 25 GeV, H1 sees four electron and six muon events,\ncompared to Standard Model expectations of 1.3 and 1.5 events, respectively.\nUnfortunately, this exciting observation is not confirmed by ZEUS, which, for\nthe same cut in pX\nT , sees one event in each category compared to the Standard\nModel expectation of 1.1 and 1.3, respectively. Intensive discussions between the\ntwo experiments have not revealed any reason why H1 might artificially produce\nsuch an excess nor why ZEUS should not observe it. It would therefore seem that\nthere must be an unlikely fluctuation: either the H1 observation is an upward\nfluctuation from the Standard Model, or ZEUS has suffered a downward fluctu-\n\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\f44\n\n2\n\nd\u03c3/dQ (pb/GeV )\n\nEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\nH1 e+p NC 94-00 prelim.\nH1 e p NC\nZEUS e+p NC 99-00 prelim.\nZEUS e-p NC 98-99 prelim.\n+\nSM e p NC (CTEQ5D)\nSM e p NC (CTEQ5D)\n\n2\n\n10\n1\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n-7\n\nH1 e+p CC 94-00 prelim.\nH1 e p CC\nZEUS e+p CC 99-00 prelim.\nZEUS e-p CC 98-99 prelim.\nSM e+p CC (CTEQ5D)\nSM e p CC (CTEQ5D)\ny < 0.9\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n2\n\n2\n\nQ (GeV )\n\nFig. 35.

There are also other interesting physics\ninvestigations possible at HERA that have not yet been carried out. For example, there is a natural build-up of transverse polarisation of the lepton beam in\nHERA that occurs through the Sokholov-Ternov effect [67]. As very successfully\ndemonstrated at HERMES using gas targets, this transverse polarisation can be\nrotated into the longitudinal direction and utilised to do physics. The installation\nof spin rotators in H1 and ZEUS would allow polarisation studies to be carried\nout at very much higher Q2 . This is particularly interesting to study the chiral\nproperties of the electroweak interaction. For these and several other reasons, it\nwas decided to embark on a major upgrade of both the HERA accelerator and\nthe H1 and ZEUS detectors. The aim of the HERA II programme is to produce\na factor of approximately five increase in luminosity and accumulate 1 fb\u22121 of\ndata with both electron and positron collisions in both longitudinal polarisation\nstates.\nThe changes to the HERA accelerator include the replacement of 480 meters\nof the vacuum system and the design and installation of almost 80 magnets in\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n46\n\n\u03bb\n\nConstraints on Scalar Leptoquarks\n1\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nF = 0, LQ \u2192 e q\n~\n( S 1 / 2, L )\n\n-2\n\n\u03bb\n\n10\n\nZEUS\nlimit\n+\n(e p, Prelim.)\nLEP indir. limit\nTEVATRON limit\n\n175 200 225 250 275 300 325 350 375 400\n1\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nH1 CI\n\nF = 2, LQ \u2192 e q , \u03bd q\n( S 0, L )\n\n-2\n\n10\n\nH1\u2013 limit\n(e p, Prelim.)\nH1 limit\n+\n(e p, 94 - 97 )\n\n175 200 225 250 275 300 325 350 375 400\n\nM LQ (GeV)\n\nFig. 37.

The ZEUS MVD [68, 69] consists of 20 \u03bcm pitch n-type siliconstrip detectors with p+ -type implants. The readout pitch is 120 \u03bcm, leading to\nmore than 200,000 readout channels, which are digitised by a custom-built clock,\ncontrol and ADC system. The detectors are organised in two main groups: a \"barrel\", which surrounds the elliptical 2 mm-thick (\u223c 1.1% of a radiation length)\naluminium-beryllium beam-pipe; and four \"wheels\", consisting of wedge-shaped\ndetectors mounted perpendicular to the beam-line in the forward direction from\nthe interaction point.

In the barrel region, the ladders, each of which consists of five silicon\ndetectors, and halves of the four forward \"wheels\", can be seen, as can the dense\narray of readout and services cables and the cooling system. The complete MVD\nwas installed in ZEUS in April 2001 and has been fully integrated with the ZEUS\nDAQ system; both cosmic-ray and beam-related data have been taken.\nThe physics programme addressed by the MVD is that of the flavour decomposition of the proton and photon and the search for physics beyond the Standard\nModel.

In addition, b-quark production can be measured precisely; a Monte Carlo simulation [70] of a measurement\nof F2b /F2c after 500 pb\u22121 is shown in Fig. 41.\nIt should also be possible, from a combination of neutral and charged current\nmeasurements, to separate out the u, d, s, c, b and g contribution to F2 .\n9.1.2 Charged-particle tracking in the forward direction The higher\nluminosity expected at HERA II will increase the number of very high-Q2 events\nin which the electron or positron is scattered into the forward direction. It will\nalso give access to rare processes, including possible physics beyond the Standard\nModel, which tend to have forward jets and/or leptons. The pattern-recognition\ncapabilities of the ZEUS Forward Tracker have therefore been improved by the\nreplacement of two layers of transition-radiation detector by layers of straw\ntubes. The straws are approximately 7.5 mm in diameter and range in length\nfrom around 20 cm to just over 1 m. They are constructed from two layers of 50\n\u03bcm kapton foil coated with a 0.2 \u03bcm layer of aluminium, surrounding a 50 \u03bcm\nwire at the centre. The straws are arranged in wedges consisting of three layers rotated with respect to each other to give three-dimensional reconstruction.\nEach of the two \"supermodules\" consists of four layers of such wedges.\n\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n49\n\nFig. 40.

To\ncompensate for this, two devices, with very different systematic uncertainties,\nhave been constructed. Both devices use the information from a small calorimeter placed around 6 m from the interaction point which detects the radiating\nelectron. It is hoped that the reduction of systematic error that can be obtained\nfrom independent luminosity measurements using very different techniques will\nallow a precision of around 1% to be attained.\n9.2\n\nPolarisation\n\nPolarisations of around 65% have been achieved at HERA I. It is hoped to\nincrease the accuracy with which the polarisation can be measured to \u03b4P/P \u223c\n2% per bunch per minute. This will be achieved by a collaboration between\nH1, HERMES, ZEUS and the HERA machine in the POL2000 project. The\ncollaboration has constructed two instruments, one to measure the longitudinal\npolarisation and the other to measure the transverse polarisation. Both detect\nasymmetries in back-scattered light from high-intensity polarised lasers.\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n50\n\nFig. 41. The MC prediction for the ratio of the contribution to F2 of b-quark\nto c-quark production in Q2 bins as a function of x after 500 pb\u22121 of data at\nHERA II.\nThe combination of high-precision measurements of both luminosity and polarisation will be important in a wide range of HERA II physics, particularly in\nthe electroweak sector. The charged current cross section should vanish for the\nappropriate combinations of lepton charge and polarisation. A measurement at\nthree polarisations, such as shown in Fig. 42, even with an integrated luminosity\nof only 50 pb\u22121 per point, will provide an accurate test of this prediction and\nthereby give sensitivity to possible new currents outside the Standard Model.\nStrong polarisation effects are also predicted at high Q2 in neutral current\ninteractions, where, e.g. at Q2 = 104 GeV2 and x = 0.2, there is a factor of\ntwo difference between the predicted cross sections for left- and right-handed\nelectrons.\nIn addition to the use of precise luminosity and polarisation information in\nthe study of electroweak processes, polarisation also offers an invaluable tool in\nthe study of possible signals beyond the Standard Model. Varying the polarisation to reduce the cross sections of Standard Model processes can improve the\nsignal to background for new physics signals, such as leptoquarks or supersymmetric particles that violate R parity, for which HERA will be competitive with\nthe Tevatron for the next few years.\n\n10\n\nSummary\n\nWe have seen that the study of deep inelastic scattering has been seminal in\nthe development of our current understanding of particle physics. In the last\ndecade, HERA I has changed our perception of QCD out of all recognition.\nIn many cases the precision of the data mandate NNL, or even high order,\nQCD predictions. The study of diffraction and the transition region between\n\nhttp://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10105/index.html\n\n\fEPJdirect A1, 1\u201311 (2018) Springer-Verlag\n\n51\n\n2\n\n\u03c3TOT (Q > 200 GeV ) (pb)\n\nZEUS CC Cross Sections\n120\n\n100\n-\n\n-1\n\n2\n\ne p Data (Prelim. 16 pb )\ne p SM \u221as=320 GeV\n-\n\nCC\n\n-\n\ne p SM (MC)\n80\n\n\u221as=320 GeV (50 pb )\n-1\n\n60\n+\n\n-1\n\ne p Data (48 pb )\ne p SM \u221as=300 GeV\n+\n+\n\ne p SM (MC)\n\n40\n\n\u221as=300 GeV (50 pb )\n-1\n\n20\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nP\n\nFig. 42.

The points at P =\n0 are obtained from ZEUS preliminary results at the indicated centre-of-mass\nenergies, while those at non-zero polarisation are Monte Carlo simulations of the\nexpected accuracy in ZEUS assuming the Standard Model cross section for an\nintegrated luminosity of 50 pb\u22121 per point.\nsoft and hard physics may be the beginning of the era of quantitative study\nof the central problem of the strong interaction, confinement. The significant\nincrease in expected luminosity and the use of new tools such as polarisation\npromise that HERA II physics should continue to provide both new results and\nsurprises in the years to come.\n\nAcknowledgements\nI am grateful to George Zoupanos and his colleagues for organising a most stimulating summer school in beautiful surroundings and with outstanding hospitality.\n\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nSee for example R.E.
