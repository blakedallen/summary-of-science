The first systematic approach to treat\na quantum field theory at finite temperature was presented in 1955 [1], the Matsubara or\nimaginary-time formalism. Since then the development of the thermal field formalism has\nfollowed the achievements of the T = 0 quantum field theory. The first generalization of the\nimaginary formalism was carried out in in 1957 [2], extending the Matsubara work to the\nrelativistic quantum field theory, and discovering periodicity (antiperiodicity) conditions for\nthe Green functions of boson (fermion) fields, a concept that later became known as the\nKMS (Kubo, Martin and Schwinger) condition.\nFrom a topological point of view, the Matsubara formalism is equivalent to a path-integral\nevaluated on RD\u22121 \u00d7 S1 , where S1 is a circumference of length \u03b2 = 1/T. As a consequence,\nthe Matsubara prescription can be thought, in a generalized way, as a mechanism to deal\nwith thermal effects and with spatial compactification. This concept has been developed by\nconsidering a simply or non-simply connected D-dimensional manifold with a topology of\nthe type \u0393dD = RD\u2212d \u00d7 S11 \u00d7 S12 * * * \u00d7 S1d , with S11 corresponding to the compactification\n\nof the imaginary time and S12 , . . . , S1d referring to the compactification of d \u2212 1 spatial\ndimensions [3]. The topological structure of the space-time does not modify the local field\nequations. However, the topology implies modifications of the boundary conditions over\nfields and Green functions [4]. Physical manifestations of this type of topology include, for\ninstance, the vacuum-energy fluctuations giving rise to the Casimir effect [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\nor in phase transitions, the dependence of the critical temperature on the parameters of\ncompactification [9, 10, 11, 12].\nIn the topology \u0393dD , the Feynman rules are modified by introducing a generalized Mat-\n\nsubara prescription, performing the following multiple replacements (compactification of a\nd-dimensional subspace),\nZ\nwhere Li ,\n\n+\u221e\n1 X\ndk1\n,\n\u2192\n2\u03c0\n\u03b2 n =\u2212\u221e\n1\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\ndki\n1 X\n;\n\u2192\n2\u03c0\nLi n =\u2212\u221e\ni\n\nk1 \u2192\n\n2n1 \u03c0\n2ni \u03c0\nki \u2192\n,\n\u03b2\nLi\n\ni = 2, 3..., d \u2212 1 are the sizes of the compactified spatial dimensions.\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fThese ideas have had recently a regain of interest, particularly as a new way to investigate the eletroweak transition and baryogenesis. For instance a recent investigation of the\neletroweak phase transition has been improved in [13, 14] in the context of a 5-dimensional\nfinite temperature theory with a compactified spatial extra dimension. These authors conclude for a first-order transition with a strength inversely proportional to the Higgs mass.\nAnother interesting result of [13] is that up to temperatures of the order of the inverse of\nthe compactification lentgh, reliable (low order) perturbative calculations lead to reasonable\nresults. In particular models where the Higgs field is identified with the internal component of a gauge field in extra compactified dimensions with size of inverse TeV [15] are\nconsidered. These are known as models with gauge-Higgs unification, and are worked-out\nexamples [16, 17, 20, 21]. Earlier references are in [18] and an overview is found in [19]. The\nfive-dimensional (5D) case, with just one extra compactified dimension, is the simplest one\nand also the one which seems phenomenologically more appealing.\nThe situation summarized above leads to appropriate developments in field theory on\nspaces with compactified dimensions, in particular for implementing proper renormalization\ntechniques in such cases. We believe that a step in this direction is considered in this paper,\nby setting a basis for full development of renormalization theory in space-time with spatial\ncompactified dimensions, at zero or finite temperature.\nIn the following, we first make a brief overview of the fundamental aspects of renormalization theory in Sec. II, in order to make this article as self-contained as possible for a\nfield-theorist reader. Then we show how dimensional renormalization can be implemented\nin an Euclidian space-time with a compactified subspace. For clear and rigorous presentations of renormalization theory in non-compactified spaces, for both commutative and\nnon-commutative field theories, the reader is referred to [22, 23, 24].\n\nII.\n\nGENERAL ASPECTS OF PERTURBATIVE RENORMALIZATION\n\nFor definiteness we consider the massive Euclidean \u03bb\u03c64D -theory described as usual, by the\nLagrangian density,\n\nm2 2\n\u03bb\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03c6 (x) + \u03c64 (x),\nL = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6(x)\u2202 \u03c6(x) +\n2\n2\n4!\n\n(2)\n\nin a non-compactified Euclidian D-dimensional space-time. In this case, the Feynman amplitude for a general diagrammatic insertion G has an expression of the form (omitting vertex\n3\n\n\ffactors and the overall symmetry coefficient),\nZ Y\nIG\nVG\nY\ndD qi\n1\nAG ({p}) \u221d\n\u03b4\nD q 2 + m2\n(2\u03c0)\ni\ni=1\nv=1\n\nI\nX\nj=1\n\n\u01ebvj qj\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere {p} stands for the set of external momenta, VG is the number of vertices, IG is the\nnumber of internal lines and qi is the momentum of each internal line i. The quantity \u01ebvi\nis the incidence matrix, which equals 1 if the line i arrives at the vertex v, \u22121 if it starts\nat v and 0 otherwise. Performing integrations over the internal momenta using the delta\nfunctions, it leads to a choice of independent loop-momenta {k\u03b1 } and we get,\nZ Y\nIG\nLG\n1\nd D k\u03b1 Y\n,\nAG ({p}) =\n2\nD\n2\n(2\u03c0)\nq\n({p},\n{k\n})\n+\nm\n\u03b1\ni\n\u03b1=1\ni=1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere LG is the number of independent loops. The momentum qi is a linear function of the\nindependent internal momenta kl and of the external momenta {p}. By power counting, we\nfind that the integral in Eq. (4) is superficially convergent if DLG \u2212 2IG < 0; otherwise, if\nDLG \u2212 2IG \u2265 0, the integral is ultraviolet divergent. So, given a diagram G, we define the\nquantity\ndG = DLG \u2212 2IG\n\n(5)\n\nas the superficial degree of divergence of the diagram. If dG \u2265 0 the diagram will be\nultraviolet divergent.\nFor any sub-diagram S \u2282 G there are corresponding sub-integrations, and we find that if\ndS = DLS \u2212 2IS \u2265 0,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere LS and IS are, respectively, the number of independent loops and the number of\ninternal lines of the sub-diagram S; an ultraviolet divergence appears associated with the\nsub-diagram S. Thus even if the diagram G is superficially convergent, dG < 0, the Feynman\nintegral AG can be divergent. For this, it is enough that there is a sub-diagram S such that\ndS \u2265 0. This has been stated in Ref. [27]. A freely transposed version of this statement is:\nTheorem II.1 Let us consider a diagram G. If for all subdiagrams S \u2286 G we have dS < 0\nthe Feynman integral AG is ultraviolet convergent. If there is at least one S \u2286 G, such that\ndS \u2265 0, AG is ultraviolet divergent.\n4\n\n\fThe divergent subdiagrams of a given diagram are called renormalization parts. For the\nfull renormalization process, only non-overlaping renormalization parts need to be considered [26, 27].\nWe present in the following an analysis in non-compactified spaces, but the general features would apply as well in the case of a compactified subspace, as it will be shown later.\nThe basis of the perturbative renormalization method is that the starting theory is not\nconsistent as a physical model, and this fact manifests itself as divergences. Then attempts\nto modify the theory are made, by introducing supplementary terms (counterterms) in the\noriginal Lagrangian, in such a way as to cancel the original divergences.\nAn important step in dimensional renormalization is dimensional regularization. There\nare different regularization methods; all of them replace divergent Feynman amplitudes with\nmore general integrals by means of a set of supplementary parameters, such that the theory does not have ultraviolet divergences when these parameters belong to some domain.\nFor a certain limit of these parameters we find the original theory with their divergences.\nThis is a provisional procedure to explore more precisely the divergences to be suppressed\nin formal calculations. Some methods of regularization are: cutoff in the momenta, PauliVillars regularization, analytic regularization, lattice regularization and dimensional regularization [29, 30]. In this case the idea is to define the Feynman integrals in a generic\nspace-time of dimension D in such a way that the divergences are recovered as poles of some\nfunctions. We will be particularly concerned with the simple integral,\n\u0001\nZ\n\u0393 s \u2212 D2\n1\ndD q\n1\ns =\nD\nD .\nD\n2\ns\u2212\n(2\u03c0) (q + M)\n(4\u03c0) 2 \u0393(s) M 2\n\n(7)\n\nWe will indicate symbolically a regularized amplitude as depending on a parameter \u03b7 and\nthe suppression of the regularization as \u03b7 \u2192 0. In what follows, unless explicitly stated, we\nunderstand renormalized quantities as the limit \u03b7 \u2192 0 of the properly regularized objects.\nFor a renormalizable theory, we look for the organization of the set of subtractions to be\nperformed in order to define the complete set of counterterms. When a counterterm cS1 for\na subdiagram S1 with N1 external lines is present, the modified Lagrangian contains a new\nvertex with N1 lines. For any S2 \u2283 S1 , subtracting the divergent integration corresponding\nto S1 is equivalent to consider the sum\nARen\nS2 = AS2 + cS1 AS2 /S1 ,\n5\n\n\fwhere AS2 /S1 is the amplitude corresponding to the reduced diagram obtained by shrinking\nthe subdiagram S1 to a point. If S2 is superficially divergent (independently of the S1 divergence), we must define another counterterm cS2 , such that\nARen\nS2 = AS2 + cS1 AS2 /S1 + cS2 .\nThe process is continued in a recurrent manner, starting from the smallest diagram to the\nlarger ones. It may be shown that, in order to obtain finite amplitudes, it is enough to\ntake simultaneously all the non-overlapping subdiagrams S. This is the origin of the BPH\n(Bogoliubov, Parasiuk, Hepp) recursive process [26, 27, 28].\nHaving defined all counterterms up to a given order n, the renormalized amplitude for a\ndiagram G of the immediatly higher order, ARen\nG , is given by,\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nX\nY\n\uf8f0AG/{S}\nARen\ncS \uf8fb + cG ,\nG =\n{S}\n\n(8)\n\nS\u2208{S}\n\nwhere cG is present if G itself is superficially divergent. The sum in Eq. (8) is over all\n\nthe families {S} of superficially divergent non-overlapping subdiagrams of G, including the\nempty family. The amplitude AG/{S} corresponds to the diagram obtained by reducing\nto a point each subdiagram of the family {S}. In the recursive process, it is understood\nthat the intermediary step of the regularization has been carried out, which is suppressed\nafter the recurrence is performed up to a given order. This procedure can be generalized\nto take into account all renormalization parts of every diagram G. Then we can state the\nBogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp recurrence [26, 28] in the form,\nTheorem II.2 We define a forest F of G as a set {Si \u2286 G} of proper (connected and 1PI)\nsubdiagrams such that for Si , Sj \u2208 F , either Si \u2282 Sj , Si \u2283 Sj , or Si \u2229 Sj = \u2205. Then the\nrenormalized amplitude of the diagram G can be written as,\n#\n\"\nY\nX\nARen\ncS + cG ,\nAG/{S}\nG =\n\n(9)\n\nS\u2208F\n\n{S}\n\nwhere cG is present if G itself is superficially divergent.\nIn Eq. (9) the product of renormalization parts is to be performed following the ordering\nin each forest, that is from smaller to bigger diagrams. Therefore the renormalized amplitude\nmay depend on the choice of momentum routing, that is, on the choice of the independent\n6\n\n\floop momenta satisfying the \u03b4-function in Eq. (3). This difficulty leads to the definition for\neach diagram, of sets of admissible momenta and for these, to the statement [27],\nTheorem II.3 The amplitude ARen\nG ({p}) in Eq. (9) is convergent for any diagram G in\nEuclidian space. Its analytical continuation to the Minkowski space defines tempered distributions.\nAn essential aspect of renormalization is to determine the renormalization parts of the\ntheory under consideration, that is, how many counterterms must be introduced in the\ntheory to make it convergent. For the \u03bb\u03c64D model the superficial degree of divergence is\nwritten as,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nD\ndG = D \u2212 VG (D \u2212 4) + NG 1 \u2212\n,\n2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere NG is the number of external legs. For D = 4, dG \u2265 0, if, and only if, NG \u2264 4. This\nimplies that to any order the only ultraviolet divergent diagrams will have NG = 2, 4. From\ntopological considerations, there are no diagrams with NG = 3 in the \u03bb\u03c64 model.\nThe insertions AG(2) and AG(4) with 2 and 4 external lines respectively, and only those,\nare ultraviolet divergent for D = 4. In this case we need to introduce only two counterterms\nin the theory c(2) + c(2)\u2032 and c(4) corresponding to the diagrams with two and four external\nlegs respectively.\nThe simplest case of dimensional regularization consists in generalizing the formula given\nby Eq. (7) in dimension D to a complex value D \u2032 . This may be carried out for more involved\nFeynman integrals, with the result that they become meromorphic functions of D \u2032 , AG (D \u2032 ),\nand the ultraviolet divergences appear as poles of Gamma- functions at D \u2032 = D. The\nexpansion around these poles allows us to define the dimensional renormalization: at each\nstep in the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk recurrence, we perform an expansion of the dimensionally\nregularized amplitudes in powers of \u01eb = D \u2032 \u2212 D. Dimensional renormalization consists,\nessentially, in subtracting the pole terms in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0, for each renormalization part\nin the BPH recurrence.\nThe main advantage of dimensional renormalization is that, in general, it respects the\nsymmetry properties of the theory, which are often dimensionally independent. On the\ncontrary, in other renormalization schemes, the symmetry usually needs to be re-established\nby adding new finite counterterms. In practical applications dimensional renormalization\nmust be carried out following the BPH recurrence, step-by-step. An alternative procedure\n7\n\n\fhas been found within the BPHZ (Bogoliubov-Prasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann) systematics [28],\nwhere an explicit global solution is obtained for the dimensional renormalization [35]. Other\nrigorous renormalization procedures are given in Refs. [34, 35, 36, 37, 38].\nAs far as the definiteness of renormalization is concerned, it is worth to recall that,\nwhenever regularization is not suppressed, amplitudes are finite to a given perturbative\norder. Trouble starts when we suppress the regulator. So, let us focus on regularized objects,\nFeynman amplitudes, counterterms, etc..., emerging from the bare Lagrangian density (2).\nTwo sets of counterterms, corresponding to two distinct renormalization schemes, differ\nby a finite counterterm. To completely define the theory it is essential to eliminate this\nambiguity. This can be achieved by defining the theory with physical conditions, fixing\nthe normalization of some Green functions at an arbitrary value of external momenta, \u03bc.\nFor the \u03bb\u03c644 theory it is enough to fix the two- and four-point functions. The renormalized\nLagrangian density is obtained from the bare Lagrangian by including counterterms,\n\n\u221a\n\nLRen =\n\nZ\nZ\nZ2 (\u03bb + c(4) ) 4\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 + (m2 + c(2) )\u03c62 +\n\u03c6,\n2\n2\n4!\n\n(11)\n\n1 + c(2)\u2032 . The counterterms c(2) and c(4) and Z and are dependent on the\n\u221a\nregulator \u03b7 and on the arbitrary parameter \u03bc. With the rescaling of the field, \u03c6\u0304 = Z\u03c6 and\nwhere Z =\n\ndefining the physical mass and the renormalized coupling constant by m\u03042 = m2 + c(2) and\n\u03bb\u0304 = \u03bb + c(4) respectively, we have,\n1\n\u03bb\u0304\n1\nLRen = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u0304 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6\u0304 + m\u03042 \u03c6\u03042 + \u03c6\u03044 .\n2\n2\n4!\n\n(12)\n\nWhen the regularization is suppressed, everything diverges: counterterms and, for consistency, the bare mass and coupling constant diverge, in such a way to provide f inite physical\nmass and coupling constant. The Lagrangian (12) generates perturbative series in the physical coupling constant \u03bb\u0304. The independence of physical quantities on the arbitrary mass\nparameter \u03bc is expressed by the well-known Callan-Symanzik equation [31].\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nCOMPACTIFICATION EFFECTS ON RENORMALIZATION\nCompactification of imaginary time\n\nWe now address the question about the renormalizability of a theory at finite temperature.\nSpecifically, we indicate how to use dimensional regularization and analytic Zeta-function\n8\n\n\ftechniques to calculate Feynman amplitudes at T 6= 0.

To get\nthe renormalized amplitude, we have to suppress the singular part of the first term and add\nits finite part to the second, temperature-dependent, contribution. The singular part of the\namplitude is easily identified by expanding the \u0393-function in a Laurent series around the\npole. The discussion presented so far is restricted to the compactification of the imaginary\ntime. It equally applies to the compactification of one spatial coordinate in the Euclidian\n\u03bb\u03c64 theory.

Given a diagram G, ultraviolet divergences arise from subdiagrams\nS \u2286 G such that the degree of divergence dS \u2265 0 in power-counting. These divergences\nappear as poles of \u0393\u2013functions with negative integer arguments (generally corresponding to\neven dimensions), a combination of the number of independent loops LS , the number of\ninternal lines IS and of the space-time dimension D. Dimensional renormalization consists\nin extracting these poles, which lead to counterterms to be inserted in the BPH recurrence,\ngiven in theorem II.2, to get finite, renormalized quantities in a space-time with a compactified subspace.\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, the general aspects of the topic presented here can be\nextended to models where the matter field (bosons or fermions) is coupled with a gauge\nfield. In these theories, an important role is played by the gauge symmetry in the discussion\nof perturbative renormalization. The Ward-Takahashi relations, that manifestly contain the\nfull implications of the symmetry, have to be satisfied.\nFrom a physical and phenomenological point of view, recently an interest in theories with\nextra compactified dimensions at the inverse TeV scale arose in connection with the new\nLHC (Large Hadron Collider) experiments. These theories provide a possible framework to\nthrow some light on the gauge hierarchy problem [13]. Also, as we have mentioned before, a\nnew idea brought by theories with extra dimensions is the relation between the Higgs field\nand the components of a gauge field. In the context of 5-dimensions [13, 14], the case of\na scalar field coupled to a gauge field is considered, where the non-vanishing component\nof the gauge field is along the compactified dimension. Models of this type are sometimes\ncalled models with gauge-Higgs unification. Perhaps these theories provide an interesting\nframework for physics beyond the standard model, even though numerous problems need to\nbe solved.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to I.
