Basic properties of the star, including its distance (760 pc) and classification as\na weak-lined T Tauri star (WTTS) were reported by Hamilton et al. (2001). It is now known\nto be a young (\u223c3 Myr) eccentric binary system embedded in a nearly edge-on circumbinary disk that is tilted, warped and precessing with respect to the binary orbit (Winn et al.\n2004; Johnson & Winn 2004; Chiang & Murray-Clay 2004; Johnson et al. 2004). When first\ndiscovered in 1995, the disk was oriented relative to our line of sight in such a way that it\ncovered most of the orbit of one star (now known as Star B) but only a small portion of the\norbit of the other (Star A). During the past 14 years, precession of the disk has caused the\nsharp edge of the opaque screen to gradually cover all of the orbit of Star B and most of\nthe orbit of Star A. As a result, we have not seen Star B (except by reflected light) since\n1995, and have seen direct light from Star A for progressively less of its 48.4 day orbital cycle\n(Hamilton et al. 2005; LeDuc et al. in prep.). Winn et al. (2006) have produced a model of\nthe system that accurately accounts for most of the photometric and radial velocity observations. They estimate the masses of Star A and Star B to be 0.6 and 0.7 M\u2299 and the radii\nto be 1.3 and 1.4 R\u2299 , respectively. The spectral class of Star A is K6/K7 (Hamilton et al.\n2001; Agol et al. 2004).\nThe system's geometry and fortunate orientation have provided astronomers with a\nunique opportunity during the past decade and a half to study the structure of both the\ngas and the dust components of an evolved protoplanetary disk. Herbst et al. (2008) argued\nthat the particulate grains making up the solid component of the disk, the \"grain disk\", are\nprobably of sand (millimeter) size or larger. It is possible that KH 15D possesses exactly\nthe sort of settled particulate disk originally envisioned by Safronov & Zvjagina (1969) and\nGoldreich & Ward (1973) as a prelude to the formation of planetesimals through gravitational instability (see also Youdin 2008). The gas disk at this stage is predicted to have a\nmuch larger scale height than the particulate disk since it is partially supported by pressure.\nBecause Star A of the KH 15D system changes elevations with respect to the edge of the\ngrain disk, during the past decade we were presented with an opportunity to observe different path lengths through any accompanying gas disk for signs of absorption. We know that\nthere is some gas still present in the disk because the star has an active magnetosphere and\ndrives a weak bipolar jet (Hamilton et al. 2003; Tokunaga et al. 2004; Deming et al. 2004;\nMundt et al. 2010; Hamilton et al. in prep.). KH 15D has the potential to tell us about an\nimportant missing link in the planet formation process: the transition from protoplanetary\ndisk to debris disk.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nIn this paper, we constrain properties of the gas component of the KH 15D circumbinary\ndisk by carefully analyzing the Na I D absorption lines visible in the spectrum of Star A while\nat various heights above the occulting disk. In \u00a72 we describe the echelle spectra available for\nthis analysis, their reduction, and the basic features of the observed Na I absorption profile.\nIn \u00a73.1 we discuss how Na I column densities are computed. In \u00a73.2 we measure interstellar\nNa I absorption toward KH 15D and discuss how this affects our absorption measurements.\nIn \u00a74.1 we discuss the implications for the scale height of the gas disk, and in \u00a74.2 we further\ndiscuss the interpretation of the data in terms of what it may reveal about the putative gas\ndisk of KH 15D. Finally, in \u00a75 we summarize the insight into the KH 15D disk revealed by\nthis investigation.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nObservations\nSpectral Data\n\nOver the past few years, a number of high-resolution echelle spectra of KH 15D have\nbeen obtained with Star A at different elevations with respect to the grain disk edge. Some\nof these spectra include the Na I D doublet at 5895.9242 and 5889.9510 \u00c5, which allows us\nto search for evidence of absorption by neutral sodium gas which may be associated with\nthe disk. These spectra were taken with the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES;\nVogt et al. 1994) on Keck I at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, the Ultraviolet and\nVisual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES; Dekker et al. 2000) on the Kueyen Telescope at the\nEuropean Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) facility on Cerro Paranal\nin Chile, and the High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS; Tull 1998) on the Hobby-Eberly\nTelescope (HET; Ramsey et al. 1998) at McDonald Observatory in Texas. A log of the\nspectra analyzed in this paper is given in Table 1.\nThe Keck/HIRES data were taken at a resolution R \u2261 \u03bb/\u2206\u03bb \u223c 45, 000 in 2003 February\nand 2005 February (W. Herbst, P.I.) The reader is referred to Hamilton et al. (in prep.)\nfor a full desciption of the reduction procedures employed. The VLT/UVES data were\ntaken at a resolution R \u223c 44, 000 in two separate observing runs, one in 2001 November\n(C. Bailer-Jones, P.I.) and one in 2004 December (R. Mundt, P.I.) Data were reduced using\nthe UVES pipeline as described in Hamilton et al. (2003) and Hamilton et al. (in prep.).\nThe HET/HRS data were taken at a resolution R \u223c 30, 000 in 2005 December and 2006\nFebruary (W. Herbst, P.I.) Data were reduced using IRAF (Tody 1993) routines to subtract\nthe bias, perform flat-field corrections, remove scattered light and cosmic rays, extract the\nechelle science and sky orders, and calibrate the wavelength solution using images of a ThAr hollow cathode taken the same night as the science data. IDL routines were written to\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nsubtract the sky spectra, normalize the science spectra, and convert to heliocentric velocities.\nThe comparison spectrum used here is of HD 36003, which has a spectral type of\nK5 V (Cenarro et al. 2007). The spectrum was taken on the night of 2003 February 8\nwith Keck/HIRES. This star has a parallax of 0.077\u2032\u2032 (Perryman et al. 1997), making it\nclose enough to alleviate worries about significant ISM contamination. While the spectral\ntype is slightly earlier than that of the visible component of KH 15D (K6/K7), the match\nwith other photospheric lines and with the extreme wings of the Na I D lines is excellent.\nThe slightly later spectral class of KH 15D is offset by its lower surface gravity relative to a\nmain sequence K6/K7 star.\nWe initially attempted to use other comparison stars that more closely match KH 15D's\nspectral type and evolutionary phase, but HD 36003 had the best overall fit to the spectra\nof KH 15D. Spectra of Hubble 4 and LkCa 7, which are nominally T Tauri stars (TTS) of\nspectral class K7, were compared with KH 15D, but the fit with the clearly uncontaminated\nspectral features was significantly worse for both T Tauri spectra than for HD 36003. This\nis most likely due to the larger rotational broadening of the features in these two TTS as\ncompared to KH 15D, which has v sin i = 6.9 \u00b1 0.3 km/s (Hamilton et al. 2005), and\nHD 36003, which has v sin i < 3 km/s (Luck & Heiter 2006). Hubble 4 has v sin i =\n14.6 \u00b1 1.7 km/s (Johns-Krull et al. 2004), while LkCa 7 has v sin i = 11 km/s (Glebocki et al.\n2001). In addition, LkCa 7 has been noted to be a poor comparison star due to anomalous\ncolors, possibly caused by a cooler companion (Gullbring et al. 1998). For these reasons, we\nchose to use HD 36003 as our comparison star.\nIn addition to this comparison star, the bright, nearby B2 III star HD 47887 was observed\nto place constraints on interstellar Na I absorption near KH 15D (\u00a73.2).\n\n2.2.\n\nThe Na I D Profile of KH 15D\n\nFigure 1 shows each of the analyzed KH 15D spectra in the region of the Na I D lines\noverlaid on the comparison spectrum, which has been appropriately shifted for each night of\ndata. To accurately align the comparison star spectrum in radial velocity with the KH 15D\nspectra, we used a \u03c72 minimization technique based on the portion of the spectrum longward\nof the Na I D1 line (\u223c5900\u20135930 \u00c5), which contains several stellar absorption features due\nto Fe I and Ti I. Formally, the comparison star spectrum should be shifted by steps in\nlog(\u03bb) (Tonry & Davis 1979), but beause our analysis region includes such a small range of\nwavelengths (\u223c15 \u00c5), the \u03c72 analysis is performed using uniform steps in \u03bb. The part of the\nspectrum within the wings of the Na I D lines was excluded from the fitting, because we are\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nattempting to measure very small discrepancies in the deepest part of these lines.\nVisual inspection of the KH 15D spectra overplotted on the shifted comparison star\nspectrum clearly reveals that the two match well except at the very bottom of the Na I D\nlines. Figure 2 shows an enlarged view of the region around the Na I D lines to make\nthe absorption and emission features more clearly visible. Here we find that the KH 15D\nNa I D line cores deviate from those of the comparison star spectrum, showing some potential\nfilling on the blue side (though telluric emission makes this difficult to see in some panels\nof Figure 1) and excess absorption on the red side of the profile. Since this absorption\nfeature appears in all 12 spectra, regardless of which telescope or reduction procedure was\nemployed, we are confident that it is real. As this absorption is asymmetric and not seen\nin the comparison star spectrum, this additional sodium absorption is most likely caused\nby something other than the photosphere of Star A. We turn now to an examination of the\nsource of this absorption and, in particular, whether it could be associated with the gaseous\ncomponent of the circumbinary disk.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nAnalysis\n\nMeasuring the Na I D Profile\n\nFollowing the procedure of Redfield (2007), we began the process of quantifying the\nexcess Na I absorption in KH 15D by taking the ratio between each available spectrum\nand the shifted comparison star spectrum after the comparison star spectrum had been\nresampled to have the same pixel sizes as the KH 15D spectrum by rebinning. The VLT\nand HET spectra are both at lower resolutions than the Keck spectra, so the comparison\nspectrum was only resampled to larger pixel sizes. The results of this process are shown in\nFigures 3 and 4 where we have effectively taken out the baseline stellar spectrum, leaving\nonly the excess absorption and emission. We discuss each of these in turn in \u00a7\u00a73.1.1 and\n3.1.2.\n\n3.1.1. Na I Emission\nWhile the dominant feature in these ratioed spectra is the red-shifted excess absorption\nfeature clearly visible in the original spectra, this more detailed look also reveals a more\nsubtle feature. All of the spectra show evidence of less absorption (or excess emission) at\nor close to the radial velocity of Star A. This emission line is especially visible in the 2003\nFebruary Keck/HIRES data (see Figure 3) where the radial velocity of Star A is closest to\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthe systemic velocity of 18.6 \u00b1 1.3 km/s (Winn et al. 2006), placing the emission feature\nclose to the deepest part of the absorption feature in the ratioed spectra. Regardless of the\nsource of this emission, in order to accurately measure any excess absorption, this emission\nfeature must be taken into account in our model.\nIt is possible that the apparent excess emission is due to the spectral mismatch between\nthe comparison star and KH 15D, but we believe that it is likely that Star A actually does\nhave an emission core within the stellar Na I D absorption features. Three arguments favor\nthe view that the excess emission is real and associated with the star. We discuss each of\nthese in turn.\nFirst, we note that the emission feature is rather variable. On some nights the emission\ncan be seen very strongly (e.g. 2005 December 22) and on others it is barely present (e.g.\n2003 February 8). While we acknowledge the danger of over-interpreting ratioed spectra,\nespecially deep in the cores of strong lines, the degree of variation does seem larger than can\neasily be accounted for by simply random noise. If the apparent emission arose only from a\nmismatch of the spectral types then it should be constant in time.\nAnother argument is that the emission closely matches the predicted radial velocity of\nStar A in each spectrum, even as Star A's radial velocity varies from -0.27\u201311.17 km/s during\nthe course of our observations. This is just what is expected for emission by gas accreting\nonto the star. The predicted radial velocities of Star A are marked in each frame of Figure 3\nfor reference.\nFinally, Star A is known to have an active magnetosphere and bipolar jet (Hamilton et al.\n2003). In this sense it is like a Classical T Tauri Star (CTTS), although the mass accretion\nrate is probably about an order of magnitude less than for a typical CTTS (Mundt et al.\n2010). Emission in Na I related to the active magnetospheres and jets has been observed\nin other T Tauri stars, particularly when they are oriented such that we view them nearly\nedge-on to their disks (Appenzeller et al. 2005), as is the case here. Furthermore, in some\nspectra the emission lines appear extended to the blue. This is also a common feature of\nCTTS spectra (Appenzeller et al. 2005) and it may be that we are detecting a rather weak\nversion of the same phenomenon here.\nOn the whole, it appears reasonable to suppose that the emission lines seen at the\nradial velocity of Star A in all of the spectra in Figure 3 are, in fact, arising within the\nmagnetosphere of Star A, although the physical nature of the excess emission is not critical\nto the process of correcting for it in the calculation of the absorption column density.\nWe note that in some spectra (e.g. the Keck spectra from 2003 February) there is also\na considerable amount of night sky emission which was not fully accounted for during the\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nreduction process. Fortunately, in each case it is sufficiently shifted in radial velocity with\nrespect to KH 15D that we have not needed to remove it from the line profiles because it\ndoes not affect the fitting results.\n\n3.1.2. Quantifying the Excess Na I Absorption\nIn order to most accurately quantify the redshifted excess absorption, we have found it\nnecessary to take into account the variable emission that follows the stellar velocity. Since the\nNa I D line is a doublet we have two absorption and two emission features to model in each\nspectrum. We have experimented with a variety of different fitting techniques employing\nconstrained and unconstrained Gaussian fits to the emission and absorption components.\nGiven the noise level of the data and uncertainties about the physical source of the features\nwe have, in the end, adopted a procedure quite similar to that employed by Redfield (2007).\nIts implementation here is described below.\nFor the two Na I D lines in the ratioed spectra, we fit a single Gaussian absorption\ncomponent and a single Gaussian emission component to each. These four Gaussians (two\nemission and two absorption) are fit simultaneously, after being convolved with the appropriate line spread function for each instrument.\nThe two emission features are fixed at the predicted radial velocity of Star A for each\nnight of data, with the strength varying freely. However, the area contained within the\nGaussian curve used to model the Na I D2 emission line is fixed to be twice that of the\nGaussian for the Na I D1 line, due to the relative oscillator strengths of the two transitions\n(Morton 2003), assuming optically thin Na I gas.\nThe three important parameters for fitting the Gaussian absorption features are the\ncolumn density, the radial velocity of the maximum absorption, and the Doppler width.\nDoppler width, also called the b-parameter or velocity-spread parameter, is the dispersion\n\u221a\nin velocities multiplied by 2. This measure of the width of the line is believed to be due\nto the Doppler effect resulting from turbulent and thermal motions (Spitzer 1978).\nFor the absorption fits, the equivalent widths of the two Gaussian features were also\nfixed to be 2:1, again corresponding to an assumption of optical thinness. For our initial fit,\nthe radial velocities and widths of the two Gaussian absorption features were allowed to vary\nfreely and were chosen by \u03c72 minimization, with the Doppler widths of the two absorption\nfeatures fixed to be the same, and the radial velocities fixed to be identical. This yielded\nabsorption features with an average radial velocity of 16.2 \u00b1 3.3 km/s, consistent with the\nsystemic velocity of 18.6 \u00b1 1.3 km/s (Winn et al. 2006), and an average Doppler width of\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n5.6 \u00b1 2.5 km/s.\nFor our final absorption measurements, the two Gaussian emission features at the radial\nvelocity of Star A and the two Gaussian absorption features were simultaneously fit to the\nobserved profiles with the Doppler widths fixed to a width that produced the best fit by eye,\nonly varying the column densities (fixed 2:1) and radial velocities (fixed to be identical) of\nthe lines for the \u03c72 minimization. This results in a measurement of the absorbing column\ndensity of Na I necessary to create the observed features. The results of our fits are listed in\nTable 1 and shown in Figure 5.\nFor internal consistency in our analysis when comparing spectra from different telescopes\nand instruments, error bars on the individual spectral datapoints were calculated using the\nstandard deviation of a range of datapoints within the normalized continuum, so that every\ndatapoint within a given spectrum is given the same error value. The error bars on the\ncolumn densities result from the standard deviation between three methods of fitting: 1)\nfreely varying all three parameters (radial velocity, Doppler width, and column density), 2)\nfixing the Doppler widths, and 3) fixing the radial velocity to match the systemic velocity.\nThis is obviously only a crude estimate of the error bars, since they are estimated from\nonly three measured values. However, propagation of errors results in rather similar error\nbars and the agreement among the various measurements on different nights gives added\nconfidence that these error bars are reasonable.\nOne source of error here is the subtraction of telluric Na I D emission lines. In the spectra\nwhere the radial velocities of telluric emission lines are closer to the \u223c18.6 km/s systemic\nvelocity (e.g. the 2001 November spectrum), it is more difficult to measure the column\ndensities. Another source of error is the widely varying strength of the stellar emission lines.\nAn additional source of systematic error may be our slightly imperfect comparison star.\nDue perhaps to the evolutionary state of KH 15D, as discussed in \u00a73.1, an earlier spectral\ntype main sequence star actually matches the spectrum better than an identical spectral type\nT Tauri star spectrum, particularly in the deep Na I D lines. However, as noted above, using\na non-identical comparison star could introduce a small systematic error in the derived Na I\ncolumn densities, as the Na I D lines are slightly different in the K5 V star (Tripicchio et al.\n1997). Such a mismatch is a possible explanation for the apparent excess flux shortward\nof Star A's central velocity, mentioned above as also perhaps arising in the magnetospheric\nemission of Star A. To a certain extent, our fitting procedure should remove this effect no\nmatter what its cause, but there may well be a residual small effect on the column densities\nthat is systematic in nature.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n3.2.\n\nCorrecting for Interstellar Absorption\n\nFigures 1 and 2 show that there is indeed excess Na I absorption present for both of\nthe Na I D lines. Additionally, the other absorption lines in the stellar spectrum match up\nvery well with absorption lines in the spectrum of the comparison star. This alone is strong\nevidence that there is some absorbing sodium gas toward the KH 15D system. Whether or\nnot this absorbing material is circumstellar needs further investigation, and in particular,\nconsideration of whether the absorption could arise in the general interstellar medium (ISM)\nbetween us and the star.\nThe only measurement of interstellar sodium in the general direction of KH 15D that\nwe could find in the literature was for S Mon, a well known spectral type O7 member of\nNGC 2264 located approximately 25\u2032 from KH 15D and likely at about the same distance\nfrom Earth. Welty et al. (1994) measure an absorbing component at roughly the systemic\nvelocity of KH 15D, but much weaker (log NNaI \u223c 11.8 cm\u22122 ), with even weaker absorption\nextending blueward to a radial velocity of about 0 km/s. Not only is this feature not\nstrong enough to account for our observations, but the general shape does not match our\nobservations. However, the distance between the sight line to this star and to KH 15D could\nresult in significantly different interstellar absorption profiles.\nTo get a better constraint on any possible interstellar medium contribution to the Na I D\nfeature in KH 15D, we observed the bright B2 III star HD 47887, a cluster member located\nonly 37\u2032\u2032 away. A spectrum was obtained with Keck/HIRES on 2003 February 9 to search\nfor evidence of Na I absorption in that star. Figure 6 shows the Na I D profile of the star\nand, indeed, two components of interstellar Na I are clearly visible. We have fit them using\nthe same methods described in \u00a73 above for KH 15D, shown in the figure. The narrower,\ndeeper component has a column density of log NNaI = 12.002 \u00b1 0.002 cm\u22122 , with a Doppler\nwidth of 1.35 \u00b1 0.01 km/s and a radial velocity of 6.24 \u00b1 0.05 km/s according to this fit.\nThe wider, shallower feature has a log NNaI = 12.093 \u00b1 0.001 cm\u22122 , with a Doppler width\nof 10.88 \u00b1 0.02 km/s and a radial velocity of 15.65 \u00b1 0.05 km/s.\nThis analysis shows that there may well be a significant contribution to the excess\nabsorption observed in KH 15D from the general interstellar medium. However, it is unlikely\nthat it can fully explain the excess absorption for the following reasons. First, the column\ndensities of Na I measured in the KH 15D spectra are, in most cases, significantly larger than\nthe total column density measured for HD 47887. Second, only the broad shallow feature is\nlikely to be contaminating our measurements because the narrow deep feature lies at a radial\nvelocity close to that of Star A in most of our spectra. Its influence would be to reduce the\napparent amount of emission in the Na I emission feature discussed in \u00a73.1.1, but it cannot\nbe masquerading as the obvious redshifted absorption component seen in Figure 1 because\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nof the radial velocity difference.\nThe broad, shallow feature, on the other hand, does nearly match the measured radial\nvelocities of the excess absorption in the KH 15D spectra, but is not as deep. It is probably\na blend of several weak components at slightly different radial velocities leading to its broad,\nshallow nature. If this absorption feature appears at exactly the same strength in the direction of KH 15D as it does in HD 47887 only 37\u2032\u2032 away, then it is not strong enough to account\nfor all of the absorption, although it does need to be corrected for in assessing how much Na I\ngas can reasonably be associated with the KH 15D disk. Our measurements have an average\nlog NNaI of 12.5 cm\u22122 . Subtracting the contribution of the ISM as measured in the spectrum\nof HD 47887 leaves log NNaI \u223c 12.3 cm\u22122 , which is our best estimate of the column density\nassociated with the disk of KH 15D. Formally, the error bar is log NNaI \u223c 0.1 cm\u22122 , but we\nnote that the possibility of systematic errors and of contributions to the column from gas\nlocal to NGC 2264 but not associated with the KH 15D disk means that our measurement\nmay be conservatively viewed as a rather strict upper limit. Certainly the column density\nof Na I associated with the putative gaseous disk of KH 15D cannot have a column density\nmuch in excess of our measurement of log NNaI \u223c 12.3 cm\u22122 .\n4.\n4.1.\n\nScale Height of the Gaseous Disk\n\nComparing our Measurements to Theory\n\nFigure 5 shows that we have not been able to detect a significant variation of Na I\ncolumn density as Star A moved relative to the grain disk edge. This is unfortunate because\nsuch a detection would have been clear evidence that the excess Na I absorption is arising\nwithin the gaseous component of the disk. We now inquire whether the failure to detect\nsuch variation is an argument that the excess absorption that we have detected could not,\nin fact, be associated with the disk.\nThe exact geometry of the KH 15D system is not known and, in particular, we do\nnot know the location of the sharp edge caused by the particulate disk. Our line of sight\nmay intercept the disk (it is perhaps more accurately referred to as a ring in this context)\nat its inner edge, outer edge, or somewhere between (these possible disk geometries are\nillustrated very clearly in Figure 6 of Winn et al. 2006). The inner edge is possibly at the\n3:1 resonance with the binary system (\u223c0.6 AU; Herbst et al. 2008) and the outer edge is\nprobably limited to 5 AU or less in order to precess (Chiang & Murray-Clay 2004). Assuming\nthat the particulate disk marks the mid-plane of the gaseous disk and that our line of sight\nis nearly along the disk plane, we may then equate the apparent distance of Star A from\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nthe opaque disk edge (\u2206) with the height of the gas layer that our line of sight to Star A\nis probing. Of course, this is a simplification because the disk must be warped and because\nwe are not really looking exactly along it. In the absence of more detailed knowledge of the\nsystem's geometry, it is a reasonable approximation.\nThe scale height (H) of the gas layer may be estimated under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in the direction perpendicular to the disk (z). Assuming an ideal gas at a\ntemperature (T ) and constant vertical component of the local gravity (gz ), one may write\nH = gz\u22121\n\nhP i\n\u03c1\n\n= gz\u22121\n\nh kT i\n\u03bcmH\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant, \u03bc is the mean molecular weight of the gas and mH is the\nmass of the hydrogen atom. We further assume that the disk gas has a cosmic abundance of\nhelium, is composed of predominantly neutral atoms, and that the Na atoms are well mixed\nwith the H and He. In this case, we may set \u03bc = 1.3.\nT is expected to be in the range of about 150 to 400 K, depending on the exact location\nof the edge. The local vertical component of gravity, gz , may be set by either the self-gravity\nof the disk or by the vertical component of the stellar gravity. In the first case, gz = 2\u03c0G\u03a3,\nwhere \u03a3 is the mass per unit area in the local disk, and in the second case gz = \u03a92 z for\nsmall z, where \u03a9 is the angular velocity of the disk material (Goldreich & Ward 1973). For\nus, the more interesting limit is the weakest gravitational field that could be present, so\nwe ignore any possible self-gravity. The range of motion of Star A in our data set is only\nabout 3 stellar radii (RA , where RA = 1.3 R\u2299 ), so we take z = 1 (in units of RA ) for this\napproximate calculation.\nWith the assumptions above, we estimate that a putative gas disk in hydrostatic equilibrium would have a measured scale height of H = 14 (2600) RA at the inner (outer) edge\nof the disk, located at 0.6 (5) AU. These scale heights are shown in Figure 5. This is too\nlarge a scale height for us to have measured, given the limited range in \u2206 probed by Star A\nduring our observations and the precision of our measurements. Conversely, one can argue\nthat if the the slightly decreasing trend of Na I column density with \u2206, visible in Figure 5,\nis real, then the occulting edge of the gas disk is likely to be the inner edge of the disk and\nthere may well be a contribution to gz from the self-gravity of the disk (i.e. it would need to\nbe a few times larger than the stars alone could provide).\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n4.2.\n\nThe Settled Grain Disk of KH 15D\n\nWe did not detect any statistically significant dependence of the excess Na I absorption\non the height of Star A above the occulting edge. One expects from the order-of-magnitude\nanalysis in \u00a74.1 that the scale height will be much greater than the few stellar radii range of\n\u2206 for which we have data. By contrast, the scale height of the grain disk responsible for the\nextinction must be less than 1 RA . It has been represented in models based on the light curve\nas a sharp \"knife edge\" (Herbst et al. 2002; Winn et al. 2006), and may be estimated from\nFigure 1 of the Supplement of Herbst et al. (2008) as having the value 0.7 RA . While there is\nuncertainty in all of these estimates it seems clear that the scale height of the particulate disk\nis at least one order of magnitude less than the scale height of any gaseous disk associated\nwith it.\nFurthermore, our lack of detection of a strong Na I feature associated with the steep\nincrease in extinction at the grain disk boundary demonstrates again how different (evolved)\nthis obscuring matter is from interstellar grains. The extinction in the I band for our most\nobscured data point (the first one in Table 1) is 0.9 mag, which for a normal interstellar\nmedium extinction law corresponds to 1.6 mag of extinction in the V band. The reddening\nassociated with this amount of extinction would be E(B-V) \u223c 0.5 mag, which would predict\na Na I column density of log NNaI = 13.2 cm\u22122 (Bohlin et al. 1978), much higher than the\nNa I column density that we actually detect.\nOur interpretation of these facts is that the particulate matter in the KH 15D disk has\ngrown large enough to become both optically grey and dynamically separated from the gas\nlayer. This requires particle sizes of a millimeter or so, consistent with the minimum grain\nsize derived by Herbst et al. (2008) on the basis of a completely different argument.\nIt would be interesting to know what the gas-to-dust ratio in the settled particulate\nlayer is. Unfortunately, converting from Na I column density to total gas column density\nis difficult for two reasons. First, the ionization fraction of sodium atoms is unknown, and\nsecond, it is likely that much of the sodium is depleted onto the solids. If ISM values of\nthe ionization and depletion applied, then there would be significantly more matter in the\nform of solids than gas. If the gas density is very high, on the other hand, one would expect\nthe solid grains to quickly lose momentum through friction with the gas and spiral into the\nstars. Unless there were a steady source of new dust, such a structure would disappear\non an astronomically brief time scale. It may be, therefore, that the very existence of the\nparticulate disk indicates a fairly low gas to dust ratio.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n5.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nNa I lines in the spectrum of the binary WTTS KH 15D have been analyzed in detail.\nWe find an excess absorption component that may be attributed to the gas component of a\ncircumbinary disk. The derived column density is log NNaI \u223c 12.5 cm\u22122 with no significant\nvariation associated with the position of Star A relative to the optically occulting edge.\nSubtracting the likely contribution of the ISM leaves log NNaI \u223c 12.3 cm\u22122 .\nThere is no detectable change in the gas column density across the \"knife edge\" formed\nby the edge of the grain disk, indicating that the gas and solids have very different scale\nheights, with the solids being highly settled.\nIf a standard ISM ratio of NNaI to AV is applied along these lines of sight, there would\nbe a much lower mass of gas than there is mass of solids in this disk. However, the conversion\nfrom Na I column density to total gas column density is complicated by the fact that much\nof the Na in this disk gas might be either ionized or depleted onto the solids.\nAn additional complication is detectable emission in the Na I feature that follows the\nradial velocity of Star A. While this might be due to the slight mismatch in the spectral type\nof the comparison spectrum, it more likely arises from the active, accreting magnetosphere\nknown to be associated with this (quasi) WTTS.\nOur data support a picture of this circumbinary disk as being composed of a very thin\nparticulate grain layer composed of sand (millimeter) sized objects or larger, which have\nsettled within whatever remaining gas may be present. This phase of disk evolution has\nbeen hypothesized to exist as a prelude to the formation of planetesimals through gravitational fragmentation (Safronov & Zvjagina 1969; Goldreich & Ward 1973) but has not been\nextensively observed, and is expected to be short-lived if much gas were still present in such\na disk.\nBoth components of KH 15D are now fully eclipsed by the circumbinary disk for the\nforseeable future (Chiang & Murray-Clay 2004), so our chance to directly measure absorption\nin this particular disk has passed. Fortunately, other young, eclipsing, edge-on disk systems\nsuch as WL4 (Plavchan et al. 2008) and YLW 16A (Plavchan et al., in prep.) are being\ndiscovered in photometric monitoring surveys, and future spectroscopic studies may allow\nbetter understanding of the timescale of dust and gas settling in transition disks.\nWe thank Coryn Bailer-Jones for some of the VLT/UVES data, and Suzan Edwards for\nthe spectrum of LkCa 7.

Note that because \u2206 is measured in\nstellar radii, none of these spectra were taken when Star A was completely obscured by the\ndisk.\nb\nc\n\nCalculated based on a slightly refined version of Model 3 of Winn et al. (2006).\n\nBarycenter correction, which shows the radial velocity telluric Na I features will have in\neach of our spectra.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Spectra of KH 15D from different nights and the comparison star spectrum, which\nhas been shifted to match the KH 15D spectra. The KH 15D spectra are shown in black,\nwhile the comparison star spectrum is red. Nights are arranged in order of increasing \u2206 (see\nTable 1). Note that absorption features are very well aligned, and that the Na I D lines both\nshow obvious excess absorption on the positive radial velocity side.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Zoomed in view of the spectrum from Keck taken on 2003 February 8 (black)\nand the properly shifted comparison star spectrum (red), allowing closer inspection of the\nabsorption and emission features.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- KH 15D spectra from each night ratioed with the comparison star spectrum (black),\nshown in order of increasing \u2206 (see Table 1).

Only two\nHET/HRS datapoints are shown, because the three datapoints with \u2206 close to 2 RA were\naveraged together, weighted by their error bars, to one point. The error bars show the\nsystematic errors, as discussed in \u00a73.1.2. The three orange lines show 3 different scale\nheights: the scale height of the grain disk (H = 0.7 RA ; dotted), the scale height calculated\nat the inner edge of the gas disk (H = 14 RA ; solid), the scale height calculated at the outer\nedge of the gas disk (H = 2600 RA ; dashed). See \u00a74.1 for calculations.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- Interstellar Na I absorption toward the spectral type B2III star HD 47887. Two\nabsorbing components are seen. The blue filled areas show the separate Gaussian components\nbefore convolution with the line spread function, while the red solid line shows the sum of\nthe two components after convolution. The solid vertical line shows the systemic velocity of\nKH 15D for reference.\n\n\f"}
