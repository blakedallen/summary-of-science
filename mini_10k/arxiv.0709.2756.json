Lateral spin\nvalve structures with Pt insertions were successfully used to measure the spin absorption efficiency\nas well as the spin accumulation in Pt induced through the spin Hall effect. Under a constant applied current the results show a decrease of the spin accumulation signal is more pronounced as the\nPt thickness exceeds the spin diffusion length. This implies that the spin accumulation originates\nfrom bulk scattering inside the Pt wire and the spin diffusion length limits the SHE. We have also\nanalyzed the temperature variation of the spin hall conductivity to identify the dominant scattering\nmechanism.\nPACS numbers: 72.25.Ba, 72.25.Mk, 75.70.Cn, 75.75.+a\n\nRecently a long-standing prediction of Spin Hall Effect\n(SHE) [1, 2, 17] has been verified by means of both optical [3, 4, 5, 12] and magneto-transport [6, 7, 8] measurements. The SHE originates from the spin-orbit coupling,\nwhich relates the spin of an electron to its momentum,\nproducing a spin current in the direction transverse to the\nflow of electrons and a spin accumulation at lateral sample boundaries. This is the direct SHE (DSHE) where\nunpolarized charge currents are converted into pure spin\ncurrents with zero net charge flow. There is also the inverse effect called inverse SHE (ISHE) where a pure spin\ncurrents can be converted into charge currents by the\nspin-orbit interaction. The SHE is therefore regarded\nas a new tool for generating and detecting spin currents,\ncrucial issues for future spintronics, that in principle does\nnot require ferromagnetic elements and/or external magnetic field.\nThe SHE induced spin accumulation in Semiconductors (SCs) have drawn much attention because of its compatibility with conventional CMOS technology. However,\nup to now SCs have exhibited very small SHE and no\nelectrical detection has been reported yet. On the contrary Pt metal has been successfully used to detect the\nSHE even at room temperature, exhibiting the largest\nspin Hall conductivity reported so far [7]. The possible\norigins of the SHE can be classified in two categories,\nintrinsic and extrinsic, depending on the dominant influence of either band structure or impurities [9]. The SHE\nis also expected to be strongly geometry dependent. In\nmetals like Pt, the SHE may be mainly attributable to\nextrinsic mechanisms such as the side jump and the skew\nscattering, which are responsible for the anomalous Hall\neffect in ferromagnets. The different sign of the side jump\nor the skew scattering angle for the two spin channels\nresults in the transverse spin current and spin accumulation at lateral boundaries. One should also remark here\nthat recent theoretical analysis based on the first principle band calculation strongly suggests that the origin\nof the large SHE in Pt is of intrinsic nature [10]. Thus\n\nit is important to perform systematically experiments in\norder to better understand the origin of the SHE.\nThe first electrical detection scheme, originally proposed by Takahashi and Maekawa [15], was successfully\napplied for alminum by Valenzuela et al [6]. But this\nmethod is not suitable for the material with a nanometer scale spin diffusion length lsf due to strong spin-orbit\ninteraction. Therefore in a previous study[7] we have\ndemonstrated a new device design where the Cu wire\ntransfers accumulated spins at the interface between ferromagnetic detector (or injector) and Pt with negligible\nrelaxation for both DSHE and ISHE measurements. In\nthe previous study, we assumed that the induced spin\ncurrent at the Cu/Pt interface was completely absorbed\nby the Pt wire because of its small spin resistance. However, the absorption efficiency of the spin current may\ndepend on the device geometry and the temperature.\nTherefore, we further modified the previous design to a\nlateral spin valve (LSV) structure with a Pt insertion,\nwhich enables us to determine explicitly the magnitude\nof the absorbed spin current. Thereby the spin Hall conductivity for the Pt wire can be well evaluated.\nOur device is based on the LSV geometry [11, 13, 14]\nwhere a Pt wire is inserted, which can be either a spin\ncurrent source for DSHE or a spin current absorber for\nISHE experiments. The devices are prepared by means\nof conventional e-beam lithography, electron gun evaporation (base pressure \u223c 10\u22128 Torr) and a lift-off process.\nThe scanning electron image of a typical device is shown\nin Fig. 1.(a). A Pt wire 100 nm wide (wPt ) with a thickness tP t varied from 5 to 20 nm is in ohmic contact with\na Cu wire running between two Permalloy (Py) wires 100\nnm in width and 30 nm in thickness. The dimensions of\nthe Cu wire are 160 nm in width and 100 nm in thickness.\nPrior to Cu evaporation a careful Ar Ion Beam Etching is\ncarried out for cleaning surface to obtain highly transparent ohmic contacts [14]. The measurements are carried\nout by using ac lock-in amplifier and an He flow cryostat.\nThe magnetic fields between \u2212 4 kOe and + 4 kOe are\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) (a) SEM image of the typical device\nfor SHE measurements and an illustration of the device. (b)\nDirect and Inverse SHE (DSHE and ISHE) recorded at T =\n10 K using a device with tP t = 20 nm, altogether with the\nAMR from the Py wire measured on the same condition.\n\napplied in the plane of the substrate.\nThe charge to spin conversion induced by SHE obeys\na relation given by the vector product, Js \u221d S \u00d7 Jc\nwith Js(c) the spin (charge) current density and S the\nspin orientation. Similarly the spin to charge conversion\nobeys the reciprocal relation, Jc \u221d S \u00d7 Js . In the case\nof DSHE, the spins of the unpolarized charge current in\nthe Pt wire are therefore aligned along the x-axis, accumulating in the vicinity of the top or bottom surface\naccording to the spin orientation. The accumulated spins\nare transferred through the Cu wire to the left Py spin\ndetector in Fig. 1 (a). The magnitude of the spin accumulation is measured as the spin signal RS = VBC /I\nwhere VBC is the voltage between the contact leads B\nand C and I (= 80\u03bcA) is the current flowing in the Pt\nwire through contact leads A and E. When the magnetic\nfield is applied along x axis, the spin signal RS exhibits\na linear increase and gets saturated above the saturation\nfield, reflecting a hard axis magnetization process of Py\nwire. This magnetization process is separately confirmed\nby the anisotropic magnetoresistance measurement as in\nthe bottom of Fig. 1 (b). The overall change \u2206RS in the\nsignal is about 0.18 m\u03a9.\nIn the case of the ISHE curve in Fig. 1.(b), the spin\ncurrent is injected by flowing a current of 240 \u03bcA between B and C. The voltage is induced between E and A\nas a result of the spin to charge conversion since the spin\ncurrent is preferentially absorbed in the Pt wire along\nthe z-axis. From the field variation, the overall change in\ncharge accumulation signal \u2206RSHE is also determined\nto be 0.18 m\u03a9 which is equal to \u2206RS in the DSHE,\nindicating the reciprocity of the behavior. The angular variation of the spin and charge accumulation signals\nmeasured with rotating the applied field direction assure\nthe relation among the vectors Js , Jc and S.\n\nFIG. 2: Temperature evolution of the spin absorption for Pt\nwires with tP t =5, 10 and 20 nm and wP t =100 nm. The inset\nshows nonlocal spin valve signals measured at 5 K for LSVs\nwith and without Pt insertion (tP t = 5 nm) clearly indicating\nparallel (P) and anti-parallel (AP) states.\n\nThe efficiency of the spin absorption is studied by non\nlocal spin valve (NLSV) measurements detailed in [14].\nFor this measurement the magnetic field is applied along\nthe Py wires. For all devices the center to center distance\nd between the Py wires is fixed to 800 nm. The inset in\nFig. 2 compares the NLSV signals measured at 5 K for the\ndevices with and without a Pt insertion between the two\nPy electrodes. The NLSV signal for I \u223c 240 \u03bcA clearly\ndecreases once the Pt is inserted, indicating the spin current absorption into the Pt wire, in good agreement with\nprevious experiments [14]. For all the devices the NLSV\nsignal is almost a factor of 5 decreased by the Pt insertion from 5 K to room temperature (RT). We now define\nthe ratio \u03b7, which is the ratio of the spin signal with and\nwith\nref\nwithout a Pt insertion, \u2206RSV\nand \u2206RSV\n, repspectively.\nBy solving the one dimensional spin diffusion model with\ntransparent interfaces, \u03b7 can be calculated as\n\u0010\n\u0011\nRPt\nCu\nsinh\nd/l\nwith\nsf\nRCu\n\u2206RSV\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2248\n.\n\u03b7\u2261\nref\nRPt\nCu\n\u2206RSV\nsinh d/lCu \u2212 1\ncosh d/l\n+\nsf\n\nRCu\n\nsf\n\n(1)\nHere, RPt and RCu are the spin resistances for the Pt and\nCu\nCu wires, respectively. lsf\nis the spin diffusion length for\nthe Cu wire.\nInteresting is that the ratio \u03b7 varies from 0.35 at 5K to\n0.2 at RT irrespective of the Pt thickness. This implies\nthat the spin absorption into the Pt wire takes place only\nat the top interface between Pt and Cu wires. The reason\nfor this may be due to the anisotropic Ar milling process\nwhich left side surfaces of the Pt insertion uncleaned.\nThe \u03b7 deduced from the experimental results yields the\nspin resistance of the Pt wire as 0.22 \u03a9 both at RT and\n5 K . Since the spin resistance of the Pt wire is given by\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) Inverse spin Hall effect measured at RT\nfor (a) tPt = 5 nm, (b) 10 nm and (c) 20 nm.

Here, the distance d is 350 \u00b120 nm.\nWe have studied about 20 devices devices of tPt = 5, 10,\nand 20 nm, with different values of d varied from 250\nto 500 nm to evaluate the thickness dependence of the\nSH signal. All the devices exhibit a gradual decrease of\nCu\nDSHE and ISHE with d proportional to sinh\u22121 (d/lsf\n)\ndue to the spin relaxation in the Cu wire. Interestingly,\na clear systematic decrease in \u2206RSHE with tP t has been\nobserved in the temperature range from 5 K to RT. Figure 3.(d) summarizes the \u2206RSHE values at RT and 5\nK obtained for the distance d of 350 nm. There is a\nvery small decrease in \u2206RSHE while the thickness tPt\nis below 10 nm. On the contrary there is a more pronounced decrease when the thickness is increased from\n10 to 20 nm. This can be understood as follows. The\nspin accumulation at the top surface of the Pt due to the\nDSHE effectively takes place in the Pt while the thickness\nPt\nPt\ntPt < lsf\n. Once tPt exceeds lsf\n, the spin accumulation\nshould not increase under the condition of the constant\ncurrent. For the ISHE, the vertical penetration of the\nPt\nspin current from Cu into Pt is limited by lsf\n, leading to\nthe same \u2206RSHE as \u2206RS . For more quantitative analyses, we calculate the thickness dependence of the spin\naccumulation \u2206VS due to DSHE at the top surface of the\nPt wire. Since the spin relaxation in the Cu wire does\nnot depend on tPt , the thickness dependence of \u2206RS or\n\u2206RSHE is proportional to \u2206VS . Using the homogeneous\nspin Hall conductivity \u03c3SHE in the Pt wire with open\n\nFIG. 4: Evaluated \u03c1SHE as a function of \u03c1P t for the device\nin Fig. 3.(a) with tP t = 5 nm and d = 325 nm. Fitting to\nthe polynomial yields \u03c1SHE = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u03c1P t [\u03bc\u03a9cm] + 1.9 \u00d7\n10\u22124 (\u03c1P t [\u03bc\u03a9cm])2 . The inset represents the calculated \u03c3SHE\nas a function of temperature using Eq. 3.\n\ncircuit condition, \u2206VS can be calculated as\n\u2206VS =\n\nPt\nPt\nexp(tPt /lsf\n)\u22121\n\u03c3SHE IC lsf\n,\n2\nPt\n\u03c3Pt wPt tPt exp(tPt /lsf ) + 1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere IC is the excitation current flowing in the Pt wire.\nPt\nAs shown in Figure 3(d), Eq. (2) with lsf\n= 10 nm at RT\nand 14 nm at 5 K, which are deduced from the absorption\nexperiment mentioned previously, fairly well reproduce\nthe thickness evolution of \u2206RSHE . The data can be well\nPt\nreproduced when slightly reducing lsf\nto 7 nm and 8 nm\nfor RT and 5 K respectively. These features strongly\nsupport the bulk origin of the DSHE and ISHE.\nFinally, we discuss the temperature dependence of the\nspin Hall conductivity. The spin Hall conductivity \u03c3SHE\ncan be calculated as\n2\n\u03c3SHE = wPt \u03c3Pt\n\nIc \u2206RSHE\nIs\n\n(3)\n\nwith the parameters in [19] to estimate the ratio Ic /Is of\ncharge to spin currents. The obtained value of \u03c3SHE is\n330 S/cm at RT, which is larger than that in the previous experiment. This is because the assumption of the\ncomplete spin current absorption into the Pt wire in the\nprevious analysis led to underestimate the spin Hall conductivity.\nUsing Eq. 3 with the temperature dependences of\n\u2206RSHE and the spin resistances for Pt, Cu and Py, we\ncan compute \u03c3SHE . As shown in the inset of Fig. 4, the\ntemperature dependence exhibits a very small variation\nof \u03c3SHE about 350 S/cm. It should be noted that the\nchange in \u03c3SHE is much smaller than that in [10] obtained from band structure calculation. Our values of\n\u03c3SHE are smaller at low temperatures but larger at RT\n(2000 S/cm and 240 S/cm in [10] for low temperature\n\n\f4\nand RT respectively). This difference could be due to\nthe dominant contribution of impurities compared to the\nband structure considerations in the Pt wires. In Fig. 4\nthe SH resistivity (\u03c1SHE \u2248 \u03c3\u03c3SHE\n) is likely to evolve in\n2\nPt\na quadratic form with the Pt resistivity \u03c1Pt with \u03c1P t in\nthis temperature range. This is expected evolution for\nside jump origin of the SHE.\nIn conclusion we have studied the evolution of the spin\nHall effect in Pt wires in the regime where the size responsible for the spin accumulation is either smaller or\nlarger than the spin diffusion length. Under the constant\nPt\ncurrent the pronounced decrease in the SHE for tP t > lsf\ndemonstrates that the SHE is induced by bulk scattering\ninside the Pt wire. The analyses on the spin Hall conductivity of the Pt wires suggest a side jump origin of the\nSHE. These results will provide important information in\ndetermining the optimum geometry for the SHE.\nWe thank Profs. Y. Iye and S.
