The holographic picture is used to\nclarify a number of important phenomenological issues in these and related models,\nincluding the questions of black hole production, radius stabilization, early universe\ncosmology, and gauge coupling unification.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe lesson from the AdS/CFT correspondence [1, 2, 3] is that a gravity theory on AdS5\nis equivalent to a strongly coupled 4D CFT. However, when all the symmetries are fully\nrealized, the physical equivalence between the theories is slightly obscure. Normally, we\nthink of two theories as being equivalent if they make identical predictions for all physical\nprocesses, such as the spectrum or S-matrix elements. However in standard AdS/CFT,\nthe theories on both sides are a little removed from our usual intuition; on the 4D side,\nCFT's do not have S-matrices or a \"spectrum\", and the same is true on the AdS side.\nThe equivalence takes on a slightly more abstract form; for every CFT operator, O,\nthere is a corresponding bulk field \u03c6. Given any boundary condition for \u03c6, \u03c60 (x), at the\n4D boundary of AdS, there is a unique solution of the gravity (or more generally the full\nstring) equations of motion in the bulk; let \u0393[\u03c60 (x)] represent the SUGRA action (or more\ngenerally full string effective action) of this solution. The AdS/CFT correspondence tells\nus that\nZ\nhexp(\u2212 d4 x\u03c60 O)iCF T = exp(\u2212\u0393[\u03c60 ]).\n(1)\n\nThis correspondence does contain all the physical information we can extract out of the\ntheories on both sides; however both sides are a little unfamiliar.\nIn this respect, the addition of the Randall-Sundrum \"Planck brane\" [4] and/or a\n\"TeV brane\" [5], which chop off parts of the AdS, is very interesting. These constructions\nhave very simple holographic interpretations, which as we will see illuminate many aspects\nof the physics and phenomenology of these models. It is also nice that the addition of the\nPlanck and/or TeV branes act as regulators, and allows for a more intuitive understanding of the holographic equivalence itself. For instance, adding a \"Planck brane\" to the\ngravity side, and making the four dimensional graviton dynamical by integrating over the\n<\nboundary conditions, corresponds to putting a UV cutoff \u223c MP l on the CFT and adding\n4D gravity. Now, the field theory is still conformal and so there is still no spectrum or\nS-matrix, but we now have gravity to act as a probe on both sides of the correspondence.\nWe can now ask the same physical questions on both sides, such as what is the the leading\ncorrection to Newton's law between two masses on the Planck brane? On the gravity side,\nthis calculation is weakly coupled, and comes from the exchange of the continuum of KK\ngravitons. On the CFT side, we compute the CFT loop correction to the 4D graviton\npropagator, which is a strongly coupled calculation but is fortunately totally determined\nby conformal invariance. The fact that the force law is identical whether one thinks in\nterms of living on a Planck brane in an infinite fifth dimension or being gravitationally\ncoupled to a CFT in 4D is a strikingly physical illustration of holography. The situation\nbecomes even clearer with the addition of a \"TeV brane\", which corresponds to some\ndeformation of the CFT leading to a breakdown of conformal invariance in the IR. Now,\nwe really do have particles and S-matrix elements, so the statement of the holographic\nequivalence between the broken CFT and the gravitational picture is the familiar one,\nnamely the two theories have identical spectra, identical S-matrices.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nThe Holographic Intepretation of RS2\n\nThroughout this paper, we will assume that the AdS/CFT correspondence can be extended to tell us that any 5D gravity theory on AdS5 is holographically dual to some\nstrongly coupled, possibly large N, 4D CFT. We will see that this assumption satisfies\nvarious consistency checks, at least qualitatively in the course of this paper. In Poincar\u00e9\nco-ordinates, the metric of AdS5 is\nds2 =\n\nL2\n(\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + dz 2 ).\nz2\n\n(2)\n\nNotice that a rescaling z \u2192 \u03bbz, x\u03bc \u2192 \u03bbx\u03bc leaves the metric invariant; translations in\nlog z correspond to 4D scale transformations. Loosely speaking, the fifth dimension z is\nencoded in the 4D theory as the RG scale, with larger z/L corresponding to the infrared in\nthe CFT. The self-similarity of the 5D background is then interpreted as the conformality\nof the 4D theory.\nBeginning with this correspondence, we can start deforming one side in some way and\nask what the deformation means on the other side. We can start by modifying the gravity\nside. One thing we can do is add the Randall-Sundrum \"Planck brane\". We will review\nrecent results indicating that the duality applies in this case [6, 7].\nA convenient way of describing this is to have a metric which is AdS for z > zc , and\nsimply reflect this space about zc for z < zc . The resulting metric is, after some obvious\nvariable changes and coordinate rescalings,\nds2 =\n\n1\n(\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + dz 2 ).\n(1 + |z/L|)2\n\n(3)\n\nThere are clearly discontinuities in the curvature at z = 0, but they are attributed to a\ndelta function brane at z = 0, with a specific tension finely tuned to the bulk cosmological constant. This is the \"Planck brane\". Studying the metric fluctuations about this\nbackground reveals a zero mode graviton localized to the brane at z = 0, with 4D Planck\nmass M4 related to the 5D Planck mass M5 via\nM42 \u223c M53 L.\n\n(4)\n\nThere is also a continuum of KK modes in the spectrum, which however has small couplings to sources on the Planck brane. The continuum modes give a correction to the\nNewtonian potential between two test masses m1 , m2 separated by a distance R on the\nbrane of the form\nm1 m2 1 L2\nV (r) =\n( + 3 ).\n(5)\nM42 r\nr\nWhat does this deformation correspond to in the gauge theory? We are modifying\nthe space away from pure AdS at small z, which corresponds to the ultraviolet in the\ngauge theory. The most natural guess is that we have taken the CFT, put some sort of\n2\n\n\fUV cut-off near M4 , and added 4D gravity to the theory. The precise structure of the\n\"Planck brane\" is reflected in the precise nature of the UV cut-off in the dual theory. So,\nthe deformation of AdS/CFT to the present case seems to suggest that the RS2 theory\nwith localized gravity in an infinite fifth dimension is dual to a strongly coupled CFT\nwith a cutoff + 4D gravity [6, 7]. This conjecture passes one immediate check. From\nthe 4D viewpoint, the leading correction to the Newton potential comes from the 1-loop\ncorrection to the graviton propagator, which is schematically, in momentum space\n1\n1\nhT (p)T (\u2212p)i 2 ,\n2\np\np\n\n(6)\n\nwhere T is the CFT energy momentum tensor. Despite the fact that the theory is strongly\ncoupled, this hT T i correlation function is fully determined by conformal invariance\nc\nhT (x)T (0)i \u223c 8 \u2192 hT (p)T (\u2212p)i = cp4 log p2 ,\n(7)\nx\nwhere c is the central charge. When transformed back into position space, this gives the\ncorrect 1/r 3 correction found from the gravity side [6, 7].\nIf there are fields (say the SM) localized on the Planck brane, then in the 4D theory\nthey interact with the CFT both through 4D gravity, and potentially also through higherdimension operators suppressed by M4 .\nWe could have of course started instead from the 4D side, and deformed the theory\nby gauging some of its global symmetries. The most natural symmetry to gauge is the\nPoincar\u00e9 symmetry of the 4D theory, i.e. add 4D gravity with some Planck scale M4 .\nSince this corresponds to a big modification at high energies \u223c M4 , on the dual side\nwe should expect some breakdown of AdS at small z, and this is the \"Planck brane\".\nActually, we need to be a little more precise about \"cutting off\" the CFT. It is important\nto recognize that from the weakly coupled gravity picture, we see that the field theory\nremains conformal in the IR in the presence of the cut-off and gravity. Obviously a\nrandom way of cutting off the CFT and adding gravity will not guarantee that the low\nenergy theory is conformal, for instance mass terms may be generated that destroy the\nconformal invariance. Consider as an example weakly coupled N = 4 SYM, and add\nordinary 4D gravity (not supergravity). Then, at two loop order, the 6 scalars pick up\nquadratically divergent masses near the cutoff M4 , and the low energy theory is certainly\nnot conformal. Had we added even just N = 1 supergravity, the scalar masses would be\nprotected and the low energy theory would continue to be conformal. What is special\nabout the way that conformal invariance is broken in the holographic dual of RS2 is that\nthe breaking of conformal invariance shows up only in Planck suppressed operators, not in\nmass terms. If we want a completely non-supersymmetric example, we need a conformal\ntheory where, even in the presence of gravity, there are no relevant deformations which\ncan not be prohibited by symmetries. For instance, a purely fermionic conformal gauge\ntheory with fermion masses prohibited by chiral symmetries might have this property.\nWe must remark that the holographic correspondence in the way described above is\nonly valid at energies E \u226a L\u22121 . For instance, on the gravity side, at distances r \u226a L,\n3\n\n\fthe gravitational potential turns over to the 5D (1/M53 r 2 ) form; the CFT +4D gravity\ncan not possibly reproduce this result. This is expected from the full duality between the\nCFT and string theory on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 , the 5D gravity/4D CFT correspondence is only\nvalid at distances larger than the radius of the S5 which is L.\n\n2.1\n\nWilsonian Renormalization and Holography\n\nMoving the position of the UV brane from \u039b = 1/L to \u039b\u2032 < \u039b corresponds to integrating\nout the degrees of freedom with energy in between the two cutoffs. This correspondence\nhas been analyzed in several papers [8, 9, 10, 11]. Specifically, ref. [11] analyzes the case\nwhere MP l < \u221e, where gravity is dynamical. In this subsection, therefore, we will be brief\nand only point out to one simple check of this correspondence. In the RS background,\nusing the metric in Eq. (2), the zero-mode of the 5-d graviton reads\ng55 (z, x) =\n\nL2\nL2\n,\ng\n(z,\nx)\n=\n0,\ng\n(z,\nx)\n=\n\u03b3\u03bc\u03bd (x).\n5\u03bc\n\u03bc\u03bd\nz2\nz2\n\n(8)\n\nWe set the UV brane at zc = L. The 4-d Planck mass is obtained by substituting the\nzero mode into the 5-d Einstein action\nS =\n\nM53\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nL\n\nM53 L\n=\n2\n\nZ\n\ndz\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\u221a\n(5)\n3\nd x \u2212gR (g) = M5\n4\n\n\u221e\n\nL\n\nL3\ndz 3\nz\n\n\u221a\nd4 x \u2212\u03b3R(4) (\u03b3).\n\n\u221a\nd4 x \u2212\u03b3R(4) (\u03b3)\n\nZ\n\n(9)\n\nThis equation gives the result mentioned above: M42 = M53 L/2. If one adds an IR brane\nat z = 1/\u03bc \u226b L, as in RS1 [5], then the 4-d Planck constant is:\nM42\n\n=\n\nM53\n\nZ\n\n1/\u03bc\n\nL\n\n1\nL3\n\u2212 \u03bc2 .\ndz 3 = M53 L3\nz\nL2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(10)\n\nThese results for the 4-d Planck mass are consistent with the interpretation of RS2 as a\nCFT with cutoff 1/L coupled to gravity, and also suggest that the holographic dual of\nRS1 is a CFT broken at scale \u03bc coupled to gravity. Both in RS1 and RS2 the Planck scale\nis fully induced by the (broken) CFT. Notice that both the scale dependence in Eq. (10)\nand the numerical coefficient M53 L3 are consistent with this interpretation. Indeed, in\nfield theory, the inverse Newton constant induced by a CFT broken at scale \u03bc and with\ncutoff 1/L is c(L\u22122 \u2212 \u03bc2 ), where c is uniquely determined by the central charge of the\nCFT; the holographic computation of c using 5-d supergravity gives precisely M53 L3 [12].\nGenerically, quantum gravity may not be fully induced by the CFT. This happens\nwhen a 4-d Einstein\naction is introduced as a boundary term on the UV brane, i.e. when\nR 4 \u221a\n2\nthe term M0 d x \u2212gR(4) (g)|z=L is added to the 5-d Einstein action. In this case, the\n4-d Planck scale is given by\nM42 = M02 + M53 L3 (\u039b2 \u2212 \u03bc2 ), \u039b =\n4\n\n1\n.\nL\n\n(11)\n\n\fThis boundary term is obviously necessary if we want to integrate out UV degrees of\nfreedom by moving the Planck brane from z = L to z = 1/\u039b\u2032 > L. To keep the physical\n4-d Planck mass invariant we must change M02 to M02 + M53 L3 (\u039b2 \u2212 \u039b\u20322 ). In [13] for\nexample, where there is an embedding of the RS-like background into string theory, M02\ndoes not vanish. Sending M0 \u2192 \u221e leaves us with the 5D holographic dual of just a cut-off\nCFT, without gravity.\n\n2.2\n\nQualitative Holography\n\nHolography tells us that the z direction of gravity theory can be interpreted as the RG\nscale of the 4D theory. It is then amusing to consider what various \"bulk\" phenomena\nlook like in the 4D picture. Of course this topic has been extensively investigated in the\ninfinite AdS case and has also been nicely analyzed in the RS case [14], so we will briefly\nconsider one bulk process by way of illustration. Imagine a graviton, starting at a given\npoint (x, z0 ) and aimed straight at the Planck brane where the SM fields live. After the\ntime required to traverse the distance to the Planck brane (which in this background\nmetric is T \u223c z0 ), the graviton bangs into it and creates e.g. photons. For times t < T\nthe graviton has not hit the Planck brane yet and so there is no photon production in\nthe classical limit. How do we understand this from the 4D side? By holography, a\npoint particle localized at some point (x, z) in the bulk must correspond to a shell-like\nconfiguration of the CFT of size z centered around x. If the bulk particle is moving at\nthe speed of light towards the Planck brane, from the 4D side the size of the CFT lump is\ndecreasing at the speed of light. When the shell is of size M4\u22121 , the standard model fields\nwill couple to the conformal field theory modes via the gravitational coupling. Photon\nproduction then happens after the time it takes for the lump to decrease from size z0 to\nM4\u22121 , which is just \u223c z0 , in agreement with the 5D picture.\n\n2.3\n\nThe Strong Coupling \"Problem\"\n\nPurely from the gravity side, the continuum KK modes of RS2 are somewhat mysterious.\nWhile we see them upon linearizing about the background at quadratic order, their selfinteractions are divergent due to the strong coupling region z \u2192 \u221e. At large z, it is not\nclear that we can think of the KK modes as the physical particles in the theory because\nthey are not weakly coupled. But on the other hand, quantities which inclusively sum over\nthe KK modes, such as the correction to the Newton potential, seem perfectly sensible.\nFrom the holographic point of view, this is obvious: there are no \"particles\" in the CFT.\nHowever, inclusive questions involving an external probe (like 4D gravity in this case) can\ngive perfectly sensible answers.\nThat there is no strong coupling problem can be understood directly from the gravity\nside from the argument in [4]. In order to most clearly understand the technical issues,\nit is most convenient to work in momentum space for 4D and position space in z. For\na process on the Planck brane to probe strong coupling in the bulk, we need to use the\n5\n\n\fbrane-bulk propagator P (p24 , z). The crucial point is that for large enough z,\n\u221a\n2\ni p24 z\nP (p4 , z) \u223c e\n.\n\n(12)\n\nAll amplitudes involve integrals of propagators convoluted with z dependent couplings in\nthe bulk, but the couplings never grow worse than powers of z, and therefore the rapid\nexponential die-off or oscillation of p ensures that the contributions from regions with\nz > 1/p4 are negligible. Processes with external momenta p4 on the brane are insensitive\nto what happens at z > (1/p4 ) in the bulk. This obliterates the strong coupling concern\nin RS2. It tells us more; even if the geometry were to change to a different AdS or deviate\nfrom AdS altogether for z bigger than some zc , for momenta p4 > 1/zc on the Planck\nbrane we would not detect measurable physical effects.\nAll of this has a natural holographic interpretation: external graviton momenta \u223c p4\nare only sensitive to the behavior of the theory at energies \u223c p4 and are in particular\ninsensitive to anything that happens at far lower energies; e.g. masses can be neglected\nat very high energies.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nHolography and RS1\nGeneralities\n\nPutting a \"TeV brane\" into the theory represents a departure from AdS at large z and\nmust therefore correspond to a breakdown of conformal invariance in the IR in the 4D\nside. Notice that the conformal field theory is badly broken in the IR; all remnant of\nconformal invariance disappears beneath this scale. Furthermore, the low-energy field\ntheory is weakly coupled and hence should not have a weakly coupled gravity description.\nThis holographic description is consistent with the form of the induced Newton constant\nwe obtained earlier in Eq. (10). Now that the conformal invariance has been broken, we\nexpect to get physical particles that we can asymptotically separate and so we can have\nS-matrices. So, the statement of the holographic equivalence is simply the intuitive one;\nthe spectra are identical and the S-matrices are the same! In particular, the KK gravitons\nin the gravity side can be interpreted in the 4D theory as resonances. Of course, since the\n4D theory is strongly coupled we could have never guessed that the low-lying spectrum of\nexcitations includes a tower of spin-2 particles. For this, the gravity description is more\nuseful, at least over the energy range where it is weakly coupled. In order for the gravity\ndescription to be weak, we need that LM5 > 1; note that all the KK graviton masses\nare quantized in units of \u03bc and they become more and more narrow as M5 L increases.\nSo, if we live on the TeV brane, the 5D gravity description is weakly coupled, and gets\nstrongly coupled for E > M\u03035 \u2261 M5 \u03bcL. Actually, since the first KK modes have mass\n\u223c \u03bc, the theory does not look 5D until E > \u03bc, so that the 5D gravity picture is useful\nin the regime \u03bc < E < M\u03035 . In [5], M5 L is chosen to be somewhat bigger than one to\nfor a reliable weak gravity description (since the hierarchy was being generated by the\n6\n\n\fexponential warp factor there was no need to make M5 L very large). We can however\ncomfortably imagine M5 L to be as big as one or two orders of magnitude.\nIn RS1, the SM fields live on the TeV brane. We now consider the question of how\nthey to be interpreted on the 4D side. In this analysis, we will assume there is a valid\ndescription at energies above the TeV scale. In this case, since from the 5D side we see\nthat the SM states become strongly coupled to the KK gravitons above M\u03035 , and since\nfrom the 4D side these KK gravitons are CFT bound states, we cannot think of the SM\nstates as \"spectators\" to the strong dynamics. Rather, the SM must emerge as bound\nstates out of the strong dynamics. So, RS1 does not literally correspond to a technicolor\ntheory (we will see what does when we discuss gauge fields in the bulk). Rather, it is a\ntheory where the SM becomes embedded in a strong CFT above the TeV scale. As such,\nit shares features in common with the proposal of [15] to solve the hierarchy problem by\nembedding the SM in a conformal theory at a TeV. There are some important differences,\nhowever: the models of [15] were not at strong coupling, and furthermore the explicit\nnon-SUSY models they considered were obtained by orbifolding conformal SUSY models,\nand were therefore only conformal in the large N limit, requiring a huge N \u223c 1030 to\nstabilize the weak scale [16]. As discussed in the introduction, it is a nontrivial thing to\nbreak conformal symmetry while not reintroducing quadratic divergences. The cutoff of\nRS1 must do this, as is readily seen from the gravity side. Generic cutoff procedures will\nnot work.\nFinally, an exercise in qualitative holography very similar to what we did for RS2 is\ninstructive. Suppose we aim a graviton from e.g. the Planck brane towards the TeV\nbrane. From the gravity point of view, it takes some time \u223c TeV\u22121 for the graviton to\nreach the TeV brane and produce SM particles. From the CFT point of view, we have a\nspherically symmetric lump of CFT that starts with a small size and grows at the speed\nof light. Only when it reaches a size of order TeV\u22121 , however, can this lump know about\nthe breaking of the CFT and create SM particles, and this takes the same time TeV\u22121 as\nin the gravity picture.\n\n3.2\n\n\"String Theory\" at a TeV\n\nOf course, all of this physics is in principle contained in the strongly coupled field theory,\nand for many processes involving energies far above M\u03035 , in the 4D picture the breaking\nof conformal invariance is unimportant and thinking in terms of a strongly coupled CFT\nis most useful. For instance, since we see that the theory gets strongly coupled at M\u03035\nfrom the 5D side, we would conclude that we hit \"string theory\" at M\u03035 . This is certainly\ntrue; we hit string theory propagating on this particular AdS background. It's just that\nstring theory on this background behaves quite differently from what we normally think\nof as string theory in flat space; AdS/CFT tells us that this string theory is really the\n\"QCD string\" of a strongly coupled 4D CFT. Let us try to better understand physics at\nenergies above M\u03035 . For instance, what happens as we heat the system to temperatures\nT \u226b M\u03035 ? One might think, from a naive expectation of string theory, that there would be\n7\n\n\fa Hagedorn limiting temperature. However, just as in QCD, no such limiting temperature\nexists. At high energies the theory is described by a (strongly coupled) 4D CFT, and\ndespite the strong coupling, conformal invariance is enough to tell us the free energy is the\nusual one for radiation F \u223c T 4 . Why do not we get the Hagedorn limiting temperature?\nAfter all, from the 5D viewpoint, we certainly have massive string modes in the bulk, and\ntheir wave functions will be localized on the TeV brane. We may also have open strings\nstuck to the TeV brane. So why do not we get the usual Hagedorn exponential density\nof states? In the analogous case in QCD, what happens is that the hadrons become so\nbroad that they cannot be thought of as particles any more, and instead we see quarks and\ngluons at high temperature. Exactly the same thing happens here. These string modes\nare just broad bound states of the CFT, and do not give rise to a Hagedorn spectrum of\nphysical states.\nIt is not surprising that a strongly coupled 4D theory should have broad resonances;\nwhat is more interesting is that we get narrow resonances: the spin 2 KK gravitons!\nNote that the KK gravitons are narrow when M5 L is large, which corresponds to large\nN in the 4D theory, so this is perhaps not unexpected. We get roughly M5 L of these\nresonances starting at \u03bc and ending at M\u03035 , above which they too become too broad to be\ncalled particles. So, following the change in free energy as the system is raised first above\ntemperature \u03bc to just beneath M\u03035 , we have\nF \u2212 (T ) = T 5 \u03bc\u22121 ,\n\n\u03bc < T < M\u03035 .\n\n(13)\n\nNote again that in this intermediate region \u03bc < T < M\u03035 , the free energy looks that of\na 5D theory. However, for temperatures T > M\u03035 , the free energy should be same as\nthe pure CFT at temperature T , which is F + (T ) \u223c cT 4 where c is the central charge,\nc = (M5 L)3 \u2261 M\u030353 \u03bc\u22123 [17]. Note that there is a transition in F between T < M\u03035 and\nT > M\u03035 :\n(14)\nF \u2212 (M\u03035 ) = M\u030354 (M5 L), F + (M\u03035 ) = M\u030354 (M5 L)3 .\nThe difference F + (M\u03035 ) \u2212 F \u2212 (M\u03035 ) signals a deconfining phase transition in the broken\nCFT at T = M\u03035 .\n\n3.3\n\nBlack Holes at a TeV\n\nOne of the features we expect of a quantum gravity theory is that, when particles are\nscattered at energies high above the Planck scale, semi-classical black-holes are formed.\nOnce they are made, these black holes decay via Hawking radiation. In a usual flat space\nbackground, for E \u226b MP l , as long as the impact parameter of the collision is less than the\nSchwarzschild radius RE of the would be black hole with the c.o.m. energy E, a black hole\nwill form with essentially unit probability. The production cross-section is then simply\nthe geometrical area\n\u03c3(E) \u223c R(E)2 .\n(15)\nIn 4 flat dimensions, R(E) \u223c E/MP2 l , so \u03c3 \u223c E 2 /MP4 l : the cross-section grows indefinitely.\n8\n\n\fWhat is the situation in RS1? For the moment, let us assume M5 L \u223c 1 for simplicity.\nAlso, since we are interested in creating 5D black holes centered on the TeV brane, let us\nignore the Planck brane, which is essential for 4D gravity but has negligible effect for 5D\nblack holes. Of course, whatever 5D black hole production and decay is, it corresponds\nto some physics in a strongly-coupled 4D field theory, but once again the real question\nis a physical one: what do we see when we scatter SM particles at energies E \u226b TeV?\nRecall that from the broken CFT point of view, the SM particles are bound states of\nsize TeV\u22121 . Scattering SM particle at energies \u226b TeV is much like scattering protons at\nenergies \u226b \u039bQCD . If the impact parameter is bigger than TeV\u22121 , nothing happens! This\nis already a dramatic difference from the usual flat space intuition, but it is equally evident\nfrom the gravity side. Recall that in the flat space case, the only reason that two particles\nat high impact parameter can form a black hole is that they attract each other through\nthe long-range gravitational force. However, the long-range gravity between two particles\non the TeV brane is exponentially small, due to the gap in the KK spectrum. So, while\nit is true that a mass of, say, 10,000 TeV would form a black hole of Schwarzschild radius\n100 TeV\u22121 centered on the TeV brane, two particles of energy 5000 TeV impinging on\neach other with this large an impact parameter would simply fly past each other without\nforming a black hole. Only if the impact parameter is less than \u223c TeV\u22121 can they collide\nand form the black hole, but the cross-section for doing this never gets bigger than \u223c\nTeV\u22122 .\nOn the other hand, if we consider the case M5 L \u2261 M\u03035 \u03bc\u22121 \u226b 1, say \u223c 10, then black\nholes of size between M\u03035\u22121 and \u03bc\u22121 are essentially the flat space black holes, and since\nthey are smaller than \u03bc\u22121 , the gap is irrelevant and they are made with the usual flat\nspace cross section, which grows with energy. Notice that in all cases, the black holes are\nsome excitation of the CFT and, since the CFT is broken, will eventually decay to the\nlightest CFT bound states, which are the SM particles. To the extent that M5 L is large,\nthis should mimic the thermal radiation one expects from the 5D gravity picture.\n\n3.4\n\nThe Radion\n\nIn the original RS1 model, by fine-tuning the tension of the negative tension brane, a static\nbackground geometry was obtained, with the separation between the branes determined\nby the expectation value of a modulus. This \"radion\" degree of freedom can be identified\nwith perturbations of the metric of the form\nds2 =\n\n1\n[dx2 + T 2 (x)dz 2 ].\n(1 + |z|/L)2 4\n\n(16)\n\nSince all mass scales on the negative tension brane are set by T , the radion couples\nconformally to all states on the IR brane.\nThe radion wave function is peaked on the TeV brane, and all of its couplings are\n1/TeV suppressed [5]; indeed this mode survives even if the Planck brane is removed to\ninfinity. As such, it must be an excitation of the dual 4D theory. But how can the scale\n9\n\n\fof conformality breaking in the dual theory be undetermined? We are not used to this in\nnon-SUSY theories, but SUSY theories almost always have moduli spaces, and if they are\nconformal they are usually only conformal at the origin of moduli space. Moving along\nthe moduli space then gives a soft breaking of conformality.\nIn any case, given that the radion exists even in the absence of the Planck brane, we\ncan identify it in standard AdS/CFT examples. For instance, take N = 4 SYM, and move\nalong the Coulomb branch in such a way as to break the nonabelian symmetry completely.\nNow, on the gravity side, moving along the Coulomb branch causes a departure from AdS\nat large z, and the 5D metric develops a naked singularity. This singular region plays\nthe role of the TeV brane in this case. Examining the perturbations on the gravity side\nindeed reveals an exactly massless \"radion\" with wave function peaked on the TeV brane.\nThe corresponding CFT mode is easily identified. Among the moduli in the N = 4\ntheory, one modulus T can be taken to set the overall scale of all the adjoint vevs, and\nthe others can be taken to be dimensionless. Since this is the only source of conformal\nviolation in the theory, every mass parameter will be proportional to T , which is just the\nsame as the conformal coupling of the radion.\nNow we can discuss the holographic interpretation of the Goldberger-Wise stabilization\nmechanism [19]. They consider a bulk scalar field \u03c6 of mass m2 , with (m2 L2 ) somewhat\nsmall (throughout the rest of this section, we will work in units where L = 1). They also\nput large potentials on the Planck and TeV branes that energetically force \u03c6 = vU V on\nthe UV brane and \u03c6 = vIR on the TeV brane with vU V 6= vIR . (The presence of a large\npotential for \u03c6 on the branes also gives a large positive mass2 to the zero mode of \u03c6 in\nthe 4D theory, regardless of the sign of m2 ). Minimizing the energy stored in \u03c6 in the\nbulk then fixes the interbrane separation. In detail, the bulk scalar equation of motion is\n(neglecting the back-reaction of \u03c6 on the metric)\n(\u2202 2 + m2 )\u03c6 = 0 \u2192 z 2 \u03c6\u2032\u2032 \u2212 3z\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 m2 \u03c6 = 0.\n\n(17)\n\nA trial solution of the form\n\u03c6(z) \u223c z \u2206 ,\n\n(18)\n\n\u2206(\u2206 \u2212 4) = m2 .\n\n(19)\n\ngives a solution as long as \u2206 satisfies\n\nThe most general solution for \u03c6 in the bulk is then of the form\n\u03c6(z) = Az \u2206\u2212 + Bz \u2206+\n\n(20)\n\nwhere A, B are constants that will have natural interpretations in the holographic picture.\nFixing \u03c6(z = zU V = 1) = vU V and \u03c6(z = zIR ) = vIR then allows us to solve for A, B.\n2\n2\nWhen m2 is small and zIR is large, we can approximate \u2206+ = 4 + m4 , \u2206\u2212 = \u2212 m4 and\nA = vU V ,\n\n2\n1\n\u2212m\nB = 4 vIR \u2212 vU V zIR 4\nzIR\n\n10\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\n\fThe energy stored in the \u03c6 field\nV (zIR ) =\n\nZ\n\nzIR\n1\n\ndz\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 2 \u20322\n2 2\nz\n\u03c6\n+\nm\n\u03c6\nz5\n\n(22)\n\nis easily computed; the leading contribution in the expansion in m2 is simply\n4\nV (zIR ) = 4zIR\nB2.\n\n(23)\n\nThis potential is minimized when B = 0, which determines zIR via\n2\n\nvIR =\n\n\u2212m\nvU V zIR 4\n\n\u2192 zIR\n\nvIR\n=\nvU V\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u2212\n\n4\nm2\n\n(24)\n\nand it is evident that an exponential hierarchy can easily be generated. Note that the\nGW mechanism works whether m2 is positive or negative [20]. In order to generate a\nlarge hierarchy, we need vU V > vIR for m2 > 0 and vU V < vIR for m2 < 0.\nNow for the holographic interpretation. In the 4D picture, the bulk scalar field \u03c6 is\nassociated with perturbing the CFT by the addition of an operator O\u03c6 , of dimension \u2206+ .\nThe quantity Az \u2206\u2212 is the running coupling constant for this operator at scale z, or in\nother words at the UV cutoff, the Lagrangian is perturbed as\nLCF T \u2192 LCF T + AO\u03c6 .\n\n(25)\n\nThe quantity B is the vev of the operator O\u03c6 :\nB = hO\u03c6 i.\n\n(26)\n\nWhen m2 is small, O\u03c6 is marginally relevant (for m2 < 0) and marginally irrelevant (for\nm2 > 0).\nConsider first the case where m2 < 0. Then, the coupling starts at vU V and grows\nslowly in the infrared, until it finally hits a critical value vIR where it triggers a complete\nbreakdown of conformality (reflected as the IR brane in the gravity picture). This is\nthe familiar picture of dimensional transmutation; a large hierarchy being generated by a\nmarginal coupling getting strong in the IR. Since B vanishes, in this vacuum hO\u03c6 i = 0.\nThe case m2 > 0 is less standard, but equivalent in many respects. Here, it is better to\nthink of generating the Planck brane (in some sense, these two theories are equivalent\nby interchanging z \u2192 1/z). In this case, the coupling starts at vIR and increases slowly\nin the UV, until when it gets larger than a critical value it triggers the breakdown of\nconformality in the UV. Notice for this interpretation, it is critical that conformality is\nbroken via mass suppressed operators in the UV, but mass operators in the IR. Again in\nthis vacuum hO\u03c6 i = 0.\nWe can also see what corresponds to changing the interbrane separation. Suppose we\nmove the IR brane from zIR to z. Then, as long as z is still far from the UV brane z \u226b 1,\nwe see that\n\u0013\n\u0012\nvIR\nz \u2212m2 /4\nA = vU V ,\nB(z) = \u2206+ 1 \u2212 (\n.\n(27)\n)\nz\nzIR\n11\n\n\fThis means that the UV coupling is begin kept fixed, but the theory is in a state |\u03c8z i,\ndifferent from the vacuum, where B = h\u03c8z |O\u03c6 |\u03c8z i =\n6 0 differs from the vacuum expectation\nvalue of O\u03c6 , hO\u03c6 i = 0. Holding the IR brane at a position z corresponds to minimizing\nh\u03c8|HCF T |\u03c8i over all states |\u03c8i subject to the constraint that h\u03c8|O\u03c6 |\u03c8i = B(z). Following\nstandard arguments, this leads us to identify the radion with the Legendre transform\nof the source for O\u03c6 , or put another way, the radion is the interpolating field for the\noperator O\u03c6 . We recall this standard argument here for completeness. Suppose we want\nto minimize h\u03c8|H|\u03c8i subject to the constraint that h\u03c8|O|\u03c8i = \u03c6. We can do this by\nintroducing a Lagrange multiplier J and minimize\nmin|\u03c8i,J h\u03c8|H|\u03c8i \u2212 J(h\u03c8|O|\u03c8i \u2212 \u03c6) = min|\u03c8i,J h\u03c8|(H \u2212 JO)|\u03c8i + J\u03c6.\n\n(28)\n\nLet first minimize w.r.t. |\u03c8i, which only enters the first term. This is minimized when\n|\u03c8i = |OJ i, which is the ground state of the Hamiltonian HJ = H \u2212 JO. The ground\nstate energy is nothing other than W (J). So, now, we have to minimize\nminJ (W (J) + J\u03c6) .\n\n(29)\n\nThe minimum occurs at some value for the source J\u03c6 , and the value of the function at the\nminimum is nothing other than the Legendre Transform \u0393(\u03c6). So, we have learned that\nthe minimum value of the energy hHi subject to the constraint hOi = \u03c6 is \u0393(\u03c6), and the\nstate for which this minimum is attained is |0J\u03c6 i, which is the ground state of a different\nHamiltonian (H \u2212 J\u03c6 O).\n\n3.5\n\n4D Quantum Gravity at MP l\n\nWe have understood from both the 5D gravity and 4D broken CFT points of view that\nthere is interesting strongly coupled physics at the TeV scale in RS1. However, it is\nequally apparent from both sides that 4D quantum gravity does not become important\nuntil we reach energy scales of order MP l . So, all the physical questions involving strong\n4D gravity, such as the resolution of 4D black-hole singularities or the big-bang singularity,\ncan only be answered at MP l . This runs counter to the naive expectation from the 5D\npicture that the \"strings\" we see at the TeV brane are just red-shifted from the \"strings\"\nwe would see on the Planck brane, which would lead us to conclude that we can learn\nabout 4D quantum gravity at MP l by probing the theory at a TeV. However, this intuition\nis incorrect because although there do exist string modes localized to the TeV brane, just\nas the zero mode graviton is localized on the Planck brane, with exponentially small wave\nfunction on the TeV brane, all the rest of the states responsible for making 4D gravity\nfinite are also localized on the Planck brane and are therefore inaccessible at TeV energies.\nThis point is also quite clear in the string realization of these models along the lines of\n[13]. There, it is true that the QCD strings and the strings responsible for making gravity\nfinite are in fact the same type IIB string. However, physics near the TeV and Planck\nbranes probe the behavior of this IIB string on very different backgrounds. Close to the\n12\n\n\fTeV brane, we are probing IIB string theory on the (deformed by the IR brane) AdS\ngeometry, where it is indistinguishable from a QCD string. On the Planck brane, on the\nother hand, we are probing the IIB string on an essentially flat (compact) background,\nwhere it does not look like a QCD string, but the more conventional string theory in flat\nspace.\n\n3.6\n\nEffective field theory\n\nFinally we wish to make a comment on the effective field theory of these warped geometries. From the gravity side, at every z the theory is weakly coupled beneath the local\ncutoff M5 (L/z) (in a string theoretic setting, the local cutoff would actually be Ms (L/z),\nwhere Ms is the string scale). Furthermore, because of the redshift factor, all processes\nwhich start within the domain of validity of this effective theory remain within the effective theory. So we are free to write down any sort of effective theory we wish; for instance\nwe can put SM fields on the TeV brane, or move the fermions around in different places in\nthe bulk etc. However, not every effective theory can be consistently embedded into a full\ntheory that has a sensible interpretation above a TeV. Normally, from a bottom-up point\nof view we do not think of this as being too constraining, since the detailed structure of\nthe underlying \"theory of everything\" is not known. As long as the low energy theory\nis consistent, we can imagine that it will somehow be embeddable into the full theory.\nOf course, our lack of knowledge about the full theory means that we can't even in principle answer questions about physics at energies far above the cutoff. However, in the\ncase where the effective theory is that of weakly coupled gravity on the AdS5 geometries,\nAdS/CFT gives us a non-perturbative definition of the gravity theory, and tells us that\nthe \"theory of everything\" that the effective theory gets embedded into is a strong 4D\nCFT. Therefore, while from the 5D point of view it seems perfectly innocuous to put SM\nfields on the TeV brane in the effective theory of RS1, we understand that embedding\nthis picture into the fundamental theory requires us to find a broken CFT where the SM\nfermion, gauge boson and Higgs fields emerge as composites.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nGauge Fields in the Bulk\nPhenomenology\n\nSeveral groups have considered putting the SM gauge fields in the bulk of the RS1 geometry. The phenomenology of these models have a number of peculiar features quite different\nfrom the case of just gravity in the bulk. For instance, when the brane separation is chosen to generate the hierarchy, the wave function of the KK gauge bosons on the Planck\nbrane is sizable, about .2\u00d7 SM gauge couplings, while the KK graviton wave functions\nare strongly suppressed there. The KK gauge boson wave function on the TeV brane are\na factor of 8 larger than the gauge coupling, with consequently severe limits on the mass\nof the first KK gauge boson in excess of 10 TeV if the SM fermions live on the TeV brane.\n13\n\n\fIn an effort to circumvent this problem, [21] considered the SM fermions localized away\nfrom the TeV brane at different points in the bulk, with the Higgs still on the TeV brane\nto maintain the solution to the hierarchy problem. The small overlap between the wave\nfunction of the left/right handed and Higgs fields helps generate a fermion mass hierarchy\nas in [22] 1\nPomarol [23] considered the case of an SU(5) gauge theory broken to the SM in the\nbulk, with all the SM fields matter fields on the Planck brane. (Of course this now requires\nSUSY for the hierarchy problem, but if SUSY breaking is triggered on the IR brane then\nthe warp factor can still be used to generate an exponential hierarchy, with the SUSY\nbreaking transmitted to the matter fields via the SM gauge interactions.) The zero modes\nof the X, Y gauge bosons pick up a mass \u223c MGU T , while the KK excitations of the X, Y\nare at \u223c TeV. Furthermore, unlike the SM KK gauge boson excitations, the X, Y zero\nand KK modes have exponentially suppressed wave functions on the TeV brane, and so\ngive no problems with proton decay. However, since the X, Y KK modes are charged\nunder the SM, they can be pair-produced at energies \u223c TeV. Pomarol also computed the\nrenormalization of the SM gauge couplings, finding the interesting result that despite the\npresence of the fifth dimension and KK gauge bosons near a TeV, the gauge couplings\ncontinue to run logarithmically as in 4D, unifying at MGU T in the usual way. However,\nthis is not quite true. In fact, we will see there are large threshold corrections. This can\nagain be seen on both sides of the duality.\nAs we will see, all of the above scenarios have a very simple holographic interpretation\nthat greatly clarifies the physics. We summarize the main results here and present technical details in the next two subsections. The key point is that holographic dual of having\ngauge fields in the bulk with gauge group G is a broken 4D CFT, where a subgroup G of\nthe global symmetry Ggl of the CFT has been weakly gauged. This is much as in the SM,\nwhere SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y weakly gauges a subgroup of the SU(Nf )L \u00d7 SU(Nf )R \u00d7 U(1)V\nglobal symmetry of QCD, with leptons added as spectator fermions to cancel anomalies.\nIn the simplest set-up, the Landau pole for the 4D gauge coupling is at the cutoff 1/L of\nthe CFT, and it runs logarithmically to weaker values at lower energies.\nJust as KK gravitons are spin 2 bound states of the broken CFT, the KK gauge\nbosons are spin 1 bound states. More specifically, whatever representation R of Ggl the\nCFT matter fields Q fall into, there will be (QQ\u0304) bound states transforming as the adjoint\nof Ggl and in particular as adjoints under the G subgroup. The bound states of this sort\nwhich have spin 1 are the KK gauge bosons. If the SM fermions are taken to live on the\nTeV brane, then they are composites of the broken CFT, and therefore their couplings\nto the spin 1 bound states are unsuppressed, surviving even in the limit where the SM\ngauge couplings are sent to zero. This provides a natural explanation for the stringent\nlimits on this scenario found in [29].\nThe dual description of the scenario of [21], where the SM fermions are localized\n1\n\nActually in order to avoid FCNC problems from non-universal couplings to the KK gauge bosons,\nthese KK modes must either be made heavier than \u223c 100 TeV or the first two generations cannot be\nsplit, and the first-second generation hierarchies must come from a separate source [22].\n\n14\n\n\faway from the TeV brane, but with the Higgs localized on the TeV brane, is similar in\nsome respects to\" walking extended technicolor\" [24]. In contrast with RS1, where the\nSM gauge bosons must be thought as bound states of the broken CFT, here we have a\nsituation where the SM is weakly gauged into a strong sector. Having the Higgs on the\nTeV brane is tantamount to saying that the strong sector spontaneously breaks some of\nits global symmetries, (the SM subgroup of which are weakly gauged). But this is exactly\nwhat we mean by technicolor. It is like \"walking\" technicolor because the strong dynamics\nhas a large window where it is nearly conformal. However, in true walking technicolor,\nonly some operators scale so slowly, whereas there is no such distinction here. Finally, a\nfermion mode localized in the bulk has the interpretation of a Higgsing of the high energy\nCFT, giving at low energies the fermion and another CFT. Integrating out the modes\nthat become heavy through the Higgsing generates higher-dimension operators between\nthe fermions and the low-energy CFT, and when the low energy CFT finally triggers\nelectroweak symmetry breaking the fermions acquire their masses. This is essentially an\nextended technicolor theory. The difference is that the standard model fermions here are\nconformal field theory bound states. Furthermore, it is difficult to see how to generate\ngenerational mixing in this way.\nThe GUT scenario of [23] also has a simple holographic interpretation. We have a\nbroken CFT with an SU(5) global symmetry, the SM subgroup of which is gauged at\nlow energies. (We could imagine that the full SU(5) was gauged and broken at the GUT\nscale, with the real X, Y gauge bosons picking up a mass MGU T .) Despite the fact that\nthe CFT is strongly coupled, the 4D gauge couplings continue to run logarithmically far\nabove the TeV scale. This is analogous to the fact that the QED gauge coupling runs\nlogarithmically despite the coupling to quarks which feel the strong confining dynamics\nof QCD. As we will see, in the CFT case we can exactly compute and reproduce the\nlogarithmic running despite the strong coupling, since the relevant hjji correlator is fixed\nby conformal invariance. From this perspective, it would seem that the unification of\ncouplings is preserved since the CFT states come in complete SU(5) multiplets. However,\nthe number of GUT representations is large, as it is determined by N which is large if\nwe are in the supergravity regime. So we expect unification will not survive this scenario.\nThat is, there should be additional threshold corrections from the gravity picture, which\nare proportional to L/g52 . Because g52 acts as a cutoff suppressing higher dimensional\noperators, one must require L large compared to this scale, so that we expect large\nthreshold effects.\nSince the CFT has an SU(5) global symmetry, there will be spin 1 resonances falling\ninto the 24 of SU(5). These decompose under the SM gauge group as adjoints (the SM KK\nmodes), and states with X, Y gauge boson quantum numbers (the X, Y KK modes). The\nCFT picture gives a simple explanation for the puzzling fact that the SM fermions have\nlarge amplitude for producing SM KK modes on the Planck brane, while the amplitude\nfor producing X, Y KK modes and KK gravitons is exponentially suppressed. From the\nCFT point of view, the SM fermions interact with the CFT either indirectly through\n4D gravity and the SM gauge interactions, or directly via higher-dimension operators\n15\n\n\fsuppressed by MP l . Since all the direct couplings between the SM fermion and the CFT\nare very suppressed, how can we get a sizeble amplitude for producing KK gauge bosons,\nwhich are after all bound states of the CFT? The answer is these spin 1 bound states are\nproduced through mixing with the SM gauge bosons. This is like the electroproduction\nof the \u03c1 meson in QCD: there is no direct coupling between electrons and quarks, but the\n\u03c1 can be produced via its mixing with the photon, with an amplitude suppressed only by\neQED . Similarly in our case, the SM KK gauge bosons can be produces with an amplitude\nonly suppressed by SM gauge couplings. On the other hand, the spin 1 bound states with\nX, Y quantum numbers can not mix with the SM gauge bosons because they do not have\nthe same quantum numbers, and so the amplitude for singly producing them can only\ncome from 1/MP l effects. They can however obviously they can be pair produced with\nSM gauge coupling strength.\nSo it appears that one can almost obtain a consistent grand unification scheme. However, one has to contend with large threshold effects which seem to destroy this unification.\n\n4.2\n\nLocalization of Bulk Gauge Fields\n\nThe presence of gauge fields in the 5-d bulk gives rise to new interesting phenomena.\nSome of the material in this section has also been discussed in [25], and resulted from\ndiscussion with E. Witten.\nIn this section the metric is\nds2 =\n\nL2\n(\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + dz 2 ),\nz2\n\nL \u2264 z \u2264 1/\u03bc.\n\n(30)\n\nThe Planck brane is located at z = L, while z = 1/\u03bc is the position of the TeV brane:\n\u03bc = O(1 T eV ).\nBy giving Neumann boundary conditions to the gauge field \u00c2m , one finds a discrete KK\ntower of states that begins with a massless mode, constant in z: \u00c25 = 0, \u00c2\u03bc (z, x) = A\u03bc (x).\nSubstituting this zero mode into the canonical action of a 5-d gauge field, with 5-d gauge\ncoupling g5 , one finds\n1\n4g52\n\nZ\n\n1/\u03bc\nL\n\ndz\n\nZ\n\nZ 1/\u03bc\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nL 2\nmp nq\n[A(x)]\nd x \u2212gg g Fmn (\u00c2)Fpq (\u00c2) = \u2212 2\ndz d4 x F\u03bc\u03bd\n4g5 L\nz\nZ\nL\n2\n[A(x)]. (31)\n= \u2212 2 log \u03bcL d4 xF\u03bc\u03bd\n4g5\n4\n\nThe 4-d coupling constant that one reads off this formula is\ng52\n.\ng =\nL log \u03bcL\n2\n\n(32)\n\nSince g depends logarithmically on the TeV scale \u03bc it seems natural to interpret Eq. (32)\nas a running coupling constant evaluated at the infrared scale \u03bc. Notice that this is\n16\n\n\fthe \"standard\" KK recipe if we identify \u03bc with the compactification scale. Interpreting\nEq. (32) as the IR 4-d coupling constant is also consistent with \u2013indeed, required by\u2013\nholographic duality.\nIn our case the correct holographic interpretation is that an RS1 background with a\npropagating 5-d gauge field is dual to a 4-d CFT broken at the scale \u03bc, coupled to a\n4-d gauge field. More precisely, the gauge field couples to some conserved current of the\nbroken CFT with running coupling constant g(p). The coupling at p = \u03bc is given by\nEq. (32), and it has a Landau pole at p = O(1/L). The beta function coefficient bCF T is\nidentified as\nbCF T\nL\n=\n(33)\n8\u03c0 2\ng52\nOf course, below p = \u03bc, the coupling no longer runs.\nTo check this interpretation we compare the Green function for two sources located\nat the boundary z = L, computed in [23] with the propagator of the 4-d gauge field \u00c3,\ncomputed using the holographic duality.\nBefore doing this, let us remark that the 5-d gauge field action is non renormalizable,\nso that it makes sense only when dimensionful coupling constant g52 is smaller than the\ncutoff length L; therefore, the 5-d description makes sense only when L/g52 \u226b 1.\n\n4.3\n\nComputation of the Propagator\n\nIn the case where there the IR brane is removed, it is trivial to compute the full gauge\nboson propagator from the CFT side, essentially copying what was done for the case of\njust gravity in the bulk. The correction to the 4D gauge boson propagator is schematically\n1\n1\nhj(p)j(\u2212p)i 2\n2\np\np\n\n(34)\n\nwhere j is the CFT current coupling to the gauge boson. Despite the strong coupling,\nthe p2 dependence of the hjji correlator is fixed by conformal invariance, since j is a\nconserved current and therefore has vanishing anomalous dimension. We therefore have\nhj(p)j(\u2212p)i \u223c p2 log p2\n\n(35)\n\nwhich yields a correction to the gauge boson propagator\nlog p2\np2\n\n(36)\n\ngiving precisely the logarithmic running of the gauge coupling. This confirms the result\nfrom the previous subsection: despite the appearance that there is no zero mode for the\ngauge field when the IR brane is removed (since the zero mode wave function is flat and\nthe mode is nonnormalizable) , in fact we have a 4D gauge field coupled to a CFT, causing\nthe gauge coupling to run logarithmically to zero in the IR.\n17\n\n\fWe can do a precise calculation of the propagator, even in the presence of the IR\nbrane, using the prescription of [2, 3]. First of all, we must solve the 5-d equations\nof motion of the field \u00c2m . This is most easily done by choosing the gauge \u00c25 = 0,\nand by Fourier-transforming the fields \u00c2\u03bc with respect to the coordinates x\u03bc . Defining\nR\n\u00c3\u03bc (z, q) = d4 x exp(iqx)\u00c2\u03bc (z, x) we find:\n\u00c3\u03bc (z, q) \u2261 C\u03bc (q)\u00c3(q, z) = C\u03bc (q)[bqzJ1 (qz) + qzY1 (qz)],\n\u2202z \u00c3\u03bc (z, q) \u2261 C\u03bc (q)\u2202z \u00c3(q, z) = qC\u03bc (q)[bqzJ0 (qz) + qzY0 (qz)].\n\n(37)\n\nC\u03bc (q) and b are constant. The boundary condition at z = 1/\u03bc is \u2202z \u00c3\u03bc (z, q) = 0; it sets\nb = \u2212Y0 (q/\u03bc)/J0 (q/\u03bc).\nAt this point, we use the standard holographic correspondence [2, 3], summarized in\nEq. (1), to compute the self energy of the gauge field. Concretely, we interpret the 5-d\ngauge field at z = L as a source for a conserved current of the broken CFT, and its\non-shell 5-d action as the generating functional of the connected Green functions. For the\ntwo-point function we have, with obvious notation\nhJ\u03bc (0)J \u0303\u03bd (q)i =\n\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\n\nq\u03bc q\u03bd\n\u2212 2\nq\n\n!\n\n\u03a3(q);\n\n1 \u2202z \u00c3\ng52 \u00c3 z=L\n1 Y0 (qL) + bJ0 (qL)\n= q 2\ng5 Y1 (qL) + bJ1 (qL)\n#\n\"\n\u03c0Y0 (q/\u03bc)\n2L\n\u2248 q 2 log(qL/2) + \u03b3 \u2212\n.\ng5\n2J0 (q/\u03bc)\n\n\u03a3(q) =\n\n(38)\n\nThe last approximate equality is valid when qL \u226a 1.\nTo find the propagator of the dynamical gauge field, we resum the self-energy in the\nusual manner. Call e the coupling of A\u03bc to the broken CFT. Define hA\u03bc (0)\u00c3\u03bd (q)i =\n(\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 q\u03bc q\u03bd /q 2 )\u03a0(q); then\n\u22121\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03a0 (q) = [q \u2212 e \u03a3(q)] = q\n\n2\n\n\u03c0Y0(q/\u03bc)\ne2 L\n1 \u2212 2 log(qL/2) + \u03b3 \u2212\ng5\n2J0 (q/\u03bc)\n\"\n\n(\n\n#)\n\n.\n\n(39)\n\nLet us consider at first large Euclidean momenta q \u2192 iq, |q| \u226b \u03bc. In this case,\n\u03c0Y0 (iq/\u03bc)/2J0(iq/\u03bc) \u2248 i\u03c0/2 and the resummed propagator produces a logarithmically\nrunning coupling constant\n1\ne2ef f (q)\n\n=\n\n1\nL\n\u2212\n[log(qL/2) + \u03b3].\ne2 g52\n\n(40)\n\nThis result agrees with ref. [23] when e \u2192 \u221e, i.e. when the Landau pole is at 2 exp(\u2212\u03b3)/L,\ni.e. at an energy of the order of the UV cutoff 1/L. Notice that the running is logarithmic\n18\n\n\fat energies well above the KK scale \u03bc. This effect is easy to understand in the 4-d field\ntheory dual of the RS compactification, since this dual is a broken CFT weakly coupled\nto a gauge field.\nThe explicit computation of the propagator has shown that our interpretation of the\ncoupling constant given in Eq. (32) as an IR coupling, evaluated at the scale \u03bc is correct.\nIn particular, even in the cutoff CFT limit \u03bc \u2192 0, the gauge field does not decouple,\nsince only the IR coupling vanishes, not the propagator at nonzero q. True decoupling is\nobtained by removing the UV brane, not by removing the IR brane.\nFinally, notice that Rthe position of the Landau pole can be changed by adding a 4-d\n2\nboundary term (1/4e20 ) d4 xF\u03bc\u03bd\n(A) to the 5-d action in Eq. (31).\n\n4.4\n\nKK Gauge Boson Production\n\nOne of the intriguing results of ref. [23] is that if on the UV brane there exist fields charged\nunder the 5-d gauge field, the amplitude for direct production of KK gauge bosons is nonnegligible. Superficially, this seems in contradiction with the holographic interpretation.\nIn the dual 4-d field theory, indeed, the KK gauge bosons are bound states of the broken\nCFT, and there is no direct coupling between the \"standard model\" fields, living on the\nUV brane, and the CFT. All interactions between these two sectors are mediated either\nby a 4-d graviton or by a 4-d gauge field. Graviton-mediated interactions are negligible\nat energies below 1/L. On the other hand, kinetic-term mixing between the gauge field\nand the CFT spin-1 bound states may (and indeed does) account for Pomarol's result.\nFirst of all, let us find the spectrum of KK excitations. A KK state obeys Neumann\nboundary conditions both at z = 1/\u03bc and z = L. This is consistent with the holographic\ninterpretation of KK excitations as bound states of the broken CFT [26]. The b.c. at\nz = 1/\u03bc gave b = \u2212Y0 (qL)/J0 (qL); the b.c. at z = L implies\nJ0 (q/\u03bc)Y0 (qL) = J0 (qL)Y0 (q/\u03bc).\n\n(41)\n\nFor \u03bcL \u226a 1, this equation is approximately solved by J0 (q/\u03bc) = 0; therefore, the spectrum\nof KK excitations is discrete and quantized in units of \u03bc.\nBy coupling the broken CFT to the gauge field A\u03bc , the mass of the KK excitations/bound states is given by the position of the poles in the propagator \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd (q), and it\nis shifted from the e = 0 value by terms O(e2 ). The mass of the n-th bound state is then\nmn = \u03bcj(0,n) + O(e2); j(0,n) is the n-th zero of J0 .\nThe n-th spin-1 bound state couples to Planck brane (\"Standard Model\") fields with\nstrength F given by\n(42)\nF 2 = 2mn Res e2 \u03a0(q)|q\u2248mn .\nThe residue is most easily evaluated by rewriting e2 \u03a0, using definition (40), as\ne2 (|q|)\n\u03c0L Y0 (q/\u03bc)\ne \u03a0(|q|) = ef f 2\n1 + e2ef f (|q|) 2\nq\n2g5 J0 (q/\u03bc)\n2\n\n\"\n\n19\n\n#\u22121\n\n.\n\n(43)\n\n\fBy expanding the expression in brackets in powers of e2ef f , and thanks to the Bessel\nfunction identities J0\u2032 (j(0,n) ) = \u2212J1 (j(0,n) ) and J1 (j(0,n) )Y0 (j(0,n) ) = 2/\u03c0j(0,n) we find that\nto order e2ef f , the coupling F is\nF =\n\ns\n\ne2ef f (mn )\n2L\n.\ng52 (mn /\u03bc)J1 (mn /\u03bc)\n\n(44)\n\nThis formula reduces exactly to the one found by Pomarol in [23] when the Landau pole\nis set at 2 exp(\u2212\u03b3)/L, i.e. when e \u2192 \u221e.\n\n5\n\nProbe Branes\n\nIn [27, 28], models for solving the hierarchy problem with infinitely large dimensions were\nconsidered, where the SM fields are localized on a probe 3-brane away from the brane\nwhere gravity is localized. Specifically, in [28], there is an infinite AdS5 with a 3-brane\nlocated away from the Planck brane where the SM is taken to live, with the warp factor\ngenerating the TeV scale exponentially as in RS1. Since we have an AdS both to the\nleft and the right of the probe brane, the 4D picture must be that at low energies we\nhave SM \u00d7 CF TL , which merge into a single CF TH theory at energies above \u039bIR \u223c TeV.\nAn example of this scenario is realized if, for instance, in the Standard N = 4 case we\nstart with N + 1 branes and remove a single \"probe\" brane away from the remaining\nstack of N branes. From the gravity side we will have something that looks identical to\nLR (except without the Planck brane). From the 4D viewpoint, we have just Higgsed\nU(N + 1) \u2192 U(N) \u00d7 U(1) at \u039bIR . Now, LR computed the correction to Newton's law on\nthe probe brane, finding\nV (r) \u223c\n\nm1 m2 1 L2\nm1 m2\n( + 3)+\n,\n2\nM4 r\nr\nT eV 8 r 7\n\n(45)\n\nwhere the last term is new and dominates at short enough distances. This can be understood from the 4D point of view as follows. After integrating out massive states at the\nscale \u039bIR , we are left with irrelevant operators linking the SM fields to the fields of the\nlow-energy CF TL . An operator allowed by all possible symmetries is\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\nT T\u03bc\u03bd CF TL .\n\u039b4IR SM\n\n(46)\n\nExchanging the CF TL states then generates the operator\ncp4 log p2 \u03bc\u03bd\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03c1\u03c3\n(p)iT\n(\u2212p)\n=\n(p)hT\n(\u2212p)T\nT\nTSM (p)T\u03bc\u03bd SM (\u2212p),\n\u03c1\u03c3\nSM\n\u03bc\u03bd\nCF\nT\nCF\nT\nSM\nL\nL\n\u039b8IR\n\u039b8IR\n\n(47)\n\nwhich precisely yields the 1/(T eV 8 r 7 ) non-relativistic potential found by LR. Here we\n\u03bc\u03bd\nhave just posited the existence of the TSM\nT\u03bc\u03bd CF T operator, and showed that it would\n20\n\n\freproduce the LR result, but in the N = 4 SYM case we can prove its existence. If we\ngo out along the Coulomb branch, Higgsing U(N + 1) \u2192 U(N) \u00d7 U(1), we can integrate\nout the heavy states and obtain the low-energy action. Of course, the theory is strongly\ncoupled, but some quantities, in particular the Tr F 4 piece of the effective action, are\nknown to be 1-loop exhausted by a nonrenormalization theorem. These operators are\nequivalent to TU\u03bc\u03bd(1) T\u03bc\u03bd SU (N ) operators, and so in this specific case we can explicitly see\nthat they are generated.\nWe can also consider the case of bulk gauge fields. Of course, in this case these be\nthe SM gauge fields, since we can not phenomenologically tolerate the gapless CFT states\ncharged under the SM gauge group. However, we can imagine some other gauge field in\nthe bulk, say coupled to B \u2212 L, under which the SM fermions are charged.\nIn the case of pure gravity in the bulk, the cross-section for KK graviton production\nwas \u03c3 \u223c E 6 /\u039b8IR , which is the same as the case of n = 6 large extra dimensions. Indeed,\nwe even expect all differential cross-sections to be the same as in the n = 6 case, since\nin both cases the cross-section for graviton production is related to the imaginary part of\nthe graviton exchange diagram, and this graviton exchange propagator is the same 1/x8 .\nWhen there are gauge fields in the bulk, however, the cross-section for producing KK\ngauge bosons is much larger. The reason is that we can produce CFT modes directly\nthrough s channel production. The cross-section is\n\u03c3(s) \u223c\n\nL e4ef f (s)\n,\ng52 s\n\n(48)\n\nand since there is no gap, this is deadly phenomenologically unless the 4D gauge coupling\neef f is tiny. This can be done either if the \u03b2 function is huge or if a large boundary gauge\ncoupling is added on the Planck brane.\n\n6\n\nInflation and Cosmology\n\nThe 4D holographic viewpoint is particularly useful for thinking about the early universe\ncosmology of models with AdS5 slices. The late cosmology of RS2 has been discussed in\ne.g. [30]. The early cosmology of RS2 with a heated bulk has been addressed in [7]. Let\nus turn to RS1. As we have discussed, contrary to the naive expectation that we cannot\nextrapolate cosmology to temperatures above \u223c TeV because of \"hitting string theory at\na TeV\", at temperatures higher than TeV the universe has normal radiation-dominated\nFRW expansion from a hot CFT. In the RS2 case, there is a solution of the 5D gravity\nequations which has an induced 4D metric on the Planck brane given by a radiation\ndominated FRW cosmology, with a retreating horizon in the bulk [7]. Physically, this\ncorresponds to the bulk initially heated up near the Planck brane, with the hot region\ngradually expanding away and cooling down. The cosmology also follows from the analysis\nof [31], who considered other potential cosmological solutions in and AdS-Schwarschild\nbackground, and found the brane moves through the static background in accordance\nwith the expected four-dimensional behavior.\n21\n\n\fNow we consider a theory which at zero temperature has an infrared breaking of the\nCFT, to generate a TeV brane. We now ask what this looks like at early times. From\nthe holographic viewpoint, it is clear that one does not expect to see a TeV brane at\ntemperatures well above a TeV, since the ultimate breaking of the conformal field theory\napplies at temperatures below that scale. So at high temperatures, there are two possible\nscenarios. The first is that the TeV brane simply does not exist at early times; the\nhorizon shields the region where the TeV brane might exist. As the temperature drops\nand the horizon receeds, it eventually uncloaks the TeV brane, and the true SM degrees\nof freedom emerge. An alternative possibility with similar physical consequences is that\na TeV brane exists at the scale associated with the temperature of the theory. Only\nwhen the temperature drops to appropriately low scale will the brane settle at its true\nminimum, analogously to the behavior of other moduli in the early universe. Notice that\nin either case, if we distinguish the AdS curvature and the fundamental Planck scales,\nwe expect a regime between these scales multiplied by the TeV warp factor in which the\ntheory appears five, not four dimensional, as the TeV brane settles to its true minimum.\nThere has been some concern about whether inflation can be made to work in RS,\nwhile getting large enough density perturbations. The worry has been that one cannot\nput the inflaton on the TeV brane, since its energy density will be too low to generate\nsufficient density perturbations, and that putting it on the Planck brane would make it\nimpossible to directly reheat SM fields. The CFT viewpoint shows to the contrary that\ndoing inflation is standard; we just add an inflaton with 1/MP l couplings to the CFT.\nAfter inflating near the GUT scale to generate appropriate \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1, the inflaton reheats the\nCFT, which eventually turns into SM particles when the temperature drops beneath a\nTeV. The bulk picture of all this is the following. After inflating, the inflaton on the\nPlanck brane reheats the bulk in the immediate vicinity of the Planck brane. This is clear\nfrom the KK picture since it has unsuppressed couplings to the heaviest KK modes. This\nreheating generates a horizon in the bulk and starts us off in the FRW solution of [7].\nThe ensuing evolution is the same as described in the previous paragraph, and the SM is\neventually reheated to T \u223c TeV. It would be interesting to investigate this 5D picture in\nmore detail.\nMuch of the worry about the early universe cosmology in RS1 has evolved around\nthe light radion. In particular, if we imagine that in the early universe the IR and UV\nbranes were far displaced from their final equilibrium values, then the early cosmology\nwill certainly not be standard FRW expansion. We can understand this from the 4D\nviewpoint given the holographic interpretation of the radion we discussed in the previous\nsubsection. Moving the IR and UV branes say, much closer to each other, corresponds to\nputting the broken CFT in a very special, non-thermal state. It is not surprising that such\na state should yield unusual cosmology. If the initial condition for QCD was a coherent\n4\nstate where e.g. Tr (F 2 ) = MGU\nT then we would also expect unusual cosmology! However,\nwe do not usually imagine such an initial state for the universe. Rather, we imagine that\nthe early universe was in a hot thermal state, and indeed this can come about through\nstandard inflation and reheating. So, while it is perfectly fine to consider cosmology with\n22\n\n\fwidely varying radions as a mathematical exercise, this does not correspond to realistic\ninitial conditions for early cosmology. The more reasonable initial condition is a thermal\none, where from the 5D point of view the TeV brane is dissolved, and instead there is a\nhorizon away from the Planck brane, giving the FRW solution of [7].\nThe cosmology of the probe brane scenarios is also interesting. From the CFT point of\nview, it is clear that the reheating temperature can not exceed \u223c TeV. If this happens, then\nas the high energy CFT cools down beneath a TeV, the energy density get divided into the\nSM and the low-energy CFT, which is still a large N gauge theory redshifting as radiation.\nThis would give too many degrees of freedom during nucleosynthesis. Therefore, we have\nto imagine that only the SM degrees of freedom are reheated. This might be difficult,\nsince the coupling to the standard model states at high energy corresponded to a coupling\nto the full high energy CFT. It is difficult to see how something could decay into standard\nmodel states but not the low-energy CFT states. Here, however, we will take the most\nconservative viewpoint and assume that initially only the SM fields are heated up. We\nthen demand that they do not heat up the low energy CFT.\nWith just gravity in the bulk, the low energy CFT is coupled to the SM most strongly\nonly via the dim. 8 operator T T operator, and so the cross section for producing the CFT\nstates with the SM fields at temperature T is \u03c3 \u223c T 6 /\u039b8IR. In order not to thermalize\nthe CFT, the mean free path l \u223c (n\u03c3v)\u22121 should be much larger than the Hubble size\nH \u22121 \u223c MP l /T 2 , and therefore we have the constraint\nT9 < T2\n< 10GeV \u039bIR\n\u2192T \u223c\n8 \u223c\n\u039bIR\nMP l\nTeV\n\u0012\n\n\u00138/7\n\n.\n\n(49)\n\nIt is interesting that this constraint on the reheating temperature is similar to the case\nof large extra dimensions with n = 6 [33]. However the physics is quite different and\nthe constraint on the probe brane theories are actually somewhat weaker. In the large\ndimension case, the KK gravitons are produced through a process of evaporation: since\neach individual KK mode only has 1/MP l interactions, while copious amounts of energy\ncan be lost into many KK modes, once produced each individual one hardly interacts with\nthe others or with the SM fields except over huge timescales comparable or longer than the\npresent age of the universe. Furthermore, they red-shift away as massive particles, so once\nthey are produced there is a greater danger that they may come to dominate the energy\ndensity of the universe. The most severe constraint came from the long-lived decays of the\nmassive KK gravitons to e.g. photons or e+ e\u2212 pairs [33, 34]. None of these things happen\nin the probe brane case, since it is clear from the 4D viewpoint that the energy thrown\ninto the CFT will redshift as radiation, and so as long as the nucleosynthesis constraint\nis obeyed there is no worry about overclosure or late decays.\nIf there are gauge fields in the bulk, then unless the 4D gauge coupling is tuned to\nbe tiny (by adding a large boundary gauge coupling on the Planck brane), the CFT\nis immediately thermalized with the SM by the gauge interactions. The CFT and SM\n\n23\n\n\fthermalize at a temperature when\nT2\nL\nL 4\ne\n(T\n)T\n\u223c\n\u2192 T = 2 e4ef f (T )MP l .\n2 ef f\ng5\nMP l\ng5\n\n(50)\n\nRequiring that this not happen till after BBN where T \u223c MeV places the constraint\nL\ng52\n\n7\n\n!1/4\n\n< 10\u22125 .\neef f (MeV) \u223c\n\n(51)\n\nRS and ADD\n\nWe summarize with a comparison of the similarities and differences between the RS1 and\nADD large extra dimensions [32] scenarios. In both theories, one can view TeV as the\nfundamental scale for observers on the brane, with the Planck scale being an induced\nscale. In the ADD scenario, that is the only point of view; the fundamental scale of\nquantum gravity is a TeV; the Planck scale is a result of the small coupling of a graviton\nspread over a large volume to the fields on the brane. In the RS1 scenario on the other\nhand, it is only observers on the TeV brane who see the TeV scale as the quantum gravity\nscale. The shape of the KK modes (and the string modes) is such that the scale for 5D\nquantum gravity (which we have seen is equivalent to a conformal field theory) depends\non the location in the fifth dimension. Nonetheless, if we live on the TeV brane, we see\nstrong interactions at a TeV, and KK modes at a TeV. However, we do not see the string\nmodes associated with the 4D Planck scale.\nIn this sense, RS1 is a theory which has both the TeV scale and the Planck scale\nwith a desert in between. Of course, the theory is strongly interacting at the TeV scale.\nNonetheless, cosmologically and otherwise, one can ask questions pertaining to physics\nabove the TeV scale. Indeed, as we have discussed these models have a holographic 4D\n<\ndescription by a conventional local field theory all the way up to the scale 1/L \u223c MP l .\nThis field theory is strongly coupled and conformal above a TeV. The solution to the\nhierarchy problem using the exponential warp factor from the 5D picture is translated\ninto dimensional transmutation in the 4D description.\nThis being said, the strong coupling field theory gives rises to many interesting physical\nphenomena near a TeV, and there is a window of energies, where the 5D gravity description\nis weakly coupled, where these are most usefully thought of as \"5D TeV quantum gravity\neffects\". The window of energies for which this 5D description is useful is given by\n1/z < E < M5 L/z where z is the position of the IR brane. Since the mass of the first\nKK graviton is given by MKK = 1/z, this window can be expressed as\nMKK < E < (M5 L)MKK .\n\n(52)\n\nFor E < MKK , there is a weakly coupled 4D effective theory, while for E > (M5 L)MKK\nthe gravity description is strongly coupled and the only non-perturbative definition of the\n24\n\n\ftheory is in terms of the 4D CFT description. For M5 L \u223c 1 this window does not exist,\nbut we can certainly imagine M5 L \u223c 10 so we could have an order of magnitude in energy\nwhere the 5D gravity description is useful. Many interesting predictions follow from this\npicture, for instance, there are about (M5 L) KK gravitons starting at MKK , which are\nwell defined, narrow resonances. These are of interpreted as spin 2 bound states of the 4D\nbroken CFT, but in the absence of putting the 4D theory on a computer their existence\ncan only be inferred from the weakly coupled 5D gravity picture. Furthermore, black\n\u22121\nholes on the TeV brane with size between and (M5 LMKK )\u22121 and MKK\nare essentially\n\"flat space\" 5D black holes and are made with the usual cross-section. Again, these states\ncan be interpreted as excitations of the CFT from the 4D viewpoint, but the properties\nof these states are most usefully described in the weakly coupled 5D picture. On the\n\u22121\nother hand, the cross-section for making black holes larger than MKK\nstops increasing\n\u22122\nand hits a maximum of \u223c TeV . This is very different than the usual intuition for black\nhole production in flat space, where the cross-section grows indefinitely with energy. As\nwe saw, this difference could be easily understood both from the gravity and the CFT\npictures.\nWe have seen that processes around a TeV can be most conveniently thought of as\narising from 5D quantum gravity effects, but as we have remarked RS1 is a theory with 4D\nquantum gravity at the Planck scale; therefore many of the effects we usually associate\nwith \"quantum gravity\" do not manifest themselves at energies lower than MP l . For\ninstance, big-bang cosmology is standard FRW cosmology for temperatures far above a\nTeV, and what resolves the big-bang singularity does not manifest itself before MP l . The\nresolution of 4D black-hole singularities occurs at MP l . 4D General Relativity is rendered\na finite theory due to additional states that show up at MP l . This is of course obvious\nfrom the 4D description, because we have simply added 4D GR to a broken strong CFT,\nbut unraveling the dynamics of the CFT tells us nothing about what eventually makes\ngravity a sensible theory above MP l . Therefore, the experimental observation of the \"5D\nTeV quantum gravity effects\" would shed no light on the 4D quantum gravity effects\ndiscussed above. From the 5D side, this can be seen because the closed string spectrum\nof states falls into two separate sectors, one near a TeV and the other near MP l .\nBy contrast, the large extra dimensions scenario has only a single quantum gravity\nscale \u223cTeV\u22121 . All quantum gravity effects are associated with the higher-dimensional\nPlanck scale, that can be as low as \u223c 1 \u2212 10 TeV, and all closed string states are at a\nTeV. These theories break the standard rules for building extensions of the SM (and also\nmake the construction more challenging), since instead of modifying the theory starting\nat short distances \u223c TeV\u22121 , the theory is modified at distances much larger than a TeV\u22121\nby the addition of large new dimensions, or equivalently by the addition of 1032 new states\n(the KK gravitons) lighter than a TeV. And finally, since the size of the extra dimensions\nin the ADD scenario can be as large as a few hundred microns, corrections to the 1/r\nNewtonian potential start at almost macroscopic distances, unlike in RS, where they start\nat almost Planckian distances O(L).\nOne can ask what would be the experimental consequence of this distinction in the25\n\n\fories. If experiments can reach the quantum gravity scale (which is above the scale for\nthe KK modes), one would see quite different strong interactions. In particular, in the\nADD scenario, one would see \"conventional\" black hole behavior (appropriate for larger\ndimensions), whereas in the RS1 scenario, there would only be a window of energies for\nwhich this applies, after which one sees cross sections most readily described by the 4D\nconformal field theory. In the ADD scenario, one would really be probing the fundamental\ngravity theory; this is not the case in the warped scenarios. One interesting consequence\nis that the LR theory [28] would be distinguished from the six large extra dimension\nscenario if and only if the quantum gravity effects are measured.\nIt should be noted that all the above conclusions about RS1 apply to theories in\nwhich the warp factor generates the hierarchy, whereas all the conclusions about ADD\napply to theories in which large dimensions, and no warp factor, are responsible for the\nhierarchy. Interesting variants of both these have been considered, and in some sense,\ninterpolate between the two different behaviors of quantum gravity. For instance, [27]\nconsidered intersecting brane scenarios with a large number of extra dimensions. In\nthis case, one can generate a hierarchy by choosing a low scale of quantum gravity, or\nfrom the warp factor (or a combination of both). If the low scale of quantum gravity is\nchosen of order TeV, and our physical 3-brane is at the intersection of the branes, the\nphenomenology reproduces that of large extra dimension scenarios. On the other hand, if\nthe hierarchy is produced by placing the 3-brane somewhere away from the intersection,\nthen the fundamental gravitational scale will be higher, and 4D quantum gravity effects\nwill not emerge at the TeV scale. On the other hand, [35] considered lowering the\nfundamental scale of the brane tension, and the 5D cosmological constant to a TeV, with\nthe fundamental Planck scale around 105 TeV. In this case, one can still use the warp\nfactor to generate the Planck scale. However, in this scenario, one has very light KK\nmodes, in fact of order mm\u22121 ! So here, the sub-millimeter phenomenology is similar to\nthe large dimension scenario.\nWe conclude that TeV experiments have the potential to unravel the physics of extra\ndimensions, should we reach the higher dimensional gravitational scale.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Tony Gherghetta, Thomas Gregoire, Markus Luty, Riccardo\nRattazzi, Valery Rubakov, Martin Schmaltz, Raman Sundrum, Jay Wacker and Ed Witten\nfor useful discussions.
