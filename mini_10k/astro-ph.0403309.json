Introduction\nOutflow and infall are inextricably associated with the\nvery earliest stages of star formation. Even while still\naccreting matter, a newborn star generates a fast, wellcollimated stellar wind that forms jets which sweep up\nthe ambient molecular gas, creating bipolar molecular outflows. The high-velocity winds create shocks, which heat\nthe gas to thousands of K when breaking up into the ambient gas. Understanding the details of the mechanism producing the acceleration of the outflow is fundamental to\nthe understanding of the star formation process itself.\nEmission of millimetre molecular lines (usually CO) at excitation temperatures Tex \u2248 10 \u2212 20 K, is used to study\nthe outflow's large-scale morphology. Whereas this component consists mostly of swept-up cloud material, and as\nsuch offers a time-averaged picture, the present flow activity is represented by a fast, hot component, traced by\nH2 ro-vibrational lines at Tex \u223c 2000 K. Where this jetlike component interacts with the slower flowing gas or\nSend\noffprint\nrequests\nfmassi@arcetri.astro.it\n\nto:\n\nF.\n\nMassi,\n\ne-mail:\n\nthe ambient cloud, bow-shaped shock fronts are visible.\nThis component, at Tex \u223c 100 K, can be traced by mmemission of molecular species that are produced only in a\nshock-driven chemistry (e.g Bachiller 1996).\nThe link between the 10-100 K gas and the hot jetcomponent is not well understood. In particular, it is\nstill an open question how the efficiency of the processes\nleading to chemical anomalies depends on the shock-type\n(J/C) and -characteristics. The comparison between the\nshocked gas components at different temperatures is thus\nfundamental to the study of the jet/outflow system and\nthe energetics of the star forming process.\nA very good place to study the jet-component, the largescale outflow, and their interaction are the Bok globules:\ncold (10 K) and relatively isolated molecular clouds associated with star formation. A catalogue of such objects (at\n\u03b4 > \u221230\u25e6 ) was compiled by Clemens & Barvainis (1988;\nhereafter CB). Because of relatively simple structure, globules form mainly low-mass stars in small numbers, and are\ntherefore without the observational confusion that one encounters in regions like Orion or Ophiuchus.\n\n\f2\n\nF. Massi et al.: Protostellar jets in CB3 and CB230\n\nFig. 1. TNG/NICS observations of CB3: The H2 emission\n(still including the contribution from the continuum). The\n4 knots (indicated by arrows) of H2 line-emission are not\nat all visible in the K-continuum image (not shown).\nWith the italian TNG (Telescopio Nazionale Galileo)\nwe have searched in four globules for the jet-component\nin the Near-InfraRed (NIR) through narrow-band H2\n(2.122 \u03bcm) and [FeII] (1.644 \u03bcm) filters. These two lines\nare particularly useful, as [FeII] traces (J-) shocks with\nvelocities of a few 100 km s\u22121 and is therefore expected to\noutline the inner jet-channel, closest to the driving source\nof the flow. Molecular hydrogen, which dissociates at shock\nvelocities > 25 \u2212 45 km s\u22121 , traces slower (C-) shocks and\nis excited in bow shocks and in shock-wakes (e.g. Allen\n& Burton 1993) and is therefore a good probe for the\nregion of interaction between jet and ambient material.\nAll four globules have been observed in the broad-band\nNIR (Yun & Clemens 1994a) and detected at 1.3 mm continuum (Launhardt & Henning 1997) and were found to\ncontain embedded objects. Molecular outflows were also\nfound in all four objects (Yun & Clemens 1994b; Codella\n& Bachiller 1999). Together, these findings identify these\nglobules as good candidates in a search for protostellar\njets. In this paper we report the detection of H2 and [FeII]\nline emission knots and jets in two of the four globules.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\nObservations were carried out with the 3.58-m Italian\nTelescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) at La Palma (Canary\nIslands, Spain) on July 13-14, 2002. The images were\nobtained with the Near Infrared Camera Spectrometer\n(NICS; Baffa et al. 2001) through narrow-band filters centered on the 1.644 \u03bcm [Feii] a4 D7/2 \u2212a4 F9/2 and 2.122 \u03bcm\n\nFig. 2. a A zoom-in on the four H2 knots in CB3.

The dashed lines indicate the alignment of pairs of knots with the outflow centre. The centre of the outflow (Codella & Bachiller 1999)\nlies at offset (0,0) and is indicated by a cross.

Therefore in order to detect the line emission the continuum has to be subtracted.\nBecause the central wavelength of the continuum filters is\ndifferent from those of the line filters, a proper subtraction\nrequires a careful scaling of the emission detected in the\ncontinuum filters. Field stars are used for this, because\ntheir emission is expected to be continuum only.\nWe have assumed that the wavelength-dependence of the\nemission in the NIR is proportional to \u03bbx . The value of\nthe slope x is derived from a comparison of the flux of a\nnumber of field stars in the line- and continuum filters.\n\nFig. 3.

We have indicated the various signposts of star formation found associated with this\nglobule: the NIR source YC1-I (Yun & Clemens 1995; circle), the IRAS point source (triangle), the 450 \u03bcm and\n850 \u03bcm peaks (Huard et al. 2000; square), and the 1.3 mm\nsource (Launhardt & Henning 1997; star). The centre of\nthe outflow (Codella & Bachiller 1999) is at offset (0,0).\nstars AS34-0, AS37-0 and AS40-0 (Hunt et al. 1998) were\nimaged through all filters on a 5 position dithered pattern\nwith the star at the centre of the array and within each\nquadrant, using integration times of 3 to 22 s (depending on the filter and the star's brightness) per position.\nDithered sky frames in all filters were acquired at dawn\nand sunset and used to construct differential flat fields.\nEach frame was first corrected for cross-talk using the routine provided on the TNG web page\n(http://www.tng.iac.es/). Then, data reduction was done\nusing standard IRAF tasks. The obtained frames were corrected for bad pixels (through median averaging of the\nadjacent pixels) and distorsion, and then flat-fielded. For\neach field and filter, the underlying background was subtracted from each image in the dithered pattern by using\nthe median of the 6 frames nearest in time. The same was\ndone for the standard stars, but using 4 frames for the\nbackground. The images were then shifted to overlap, and\naveraged. Absolute coordinates were obtained through astrometry on HST Guide Stars present in (or near) the\nNICS fields, as explained in Massi et al. (1999).\n\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Removing the continuum\nObservations in the H2 and [FeII] filters contain, apart\nfrom the emission in the lines themselves (if present) also\n\nIn CB188 and CB205, no jet-like features are detected\nafter subtraction, whereas in CB3 and CB230 pure H2\nand [FeII] emission knots and protostellar jets have been\nclearly revealed.\nPhotometry of the line-emission knots has been performed\non the subtracted images using the task POLYPHOT in\nIRAF, roughly including the emission down to a \u223c 1\u03c3\nlimit. The sensitivity limit (of integrated line flux) is\n2 \u2212 3 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 arcsec\u22121 , both in the H2 and\nin the [FeII] images; the limiting flux increases towards\nregions of diffuse emission.\n\n3.2. CB3\nThis globule is associated with different generations of star\nformation, as pointed out by the presence of a NIR Young\nStellar Object (YSO; Yun & Clemens 1995, 1994a), a 1.3\nmm object (Launhardt & Henning 1997), and a sub-mm\nsource (Huard et al. 2000). This globule also contains an\nIRAS point source (IRAS00259+5625), which lies among\nthese objects; its flux is probably derived (in part) from\ncontributions by these various objects. A molecular outflow was detected by Yun & Clemens (1992, 1994b) in\nCO and mapped in various molecular lines by Codella &\nBachiller (1999), who found that the outflow is centered\nat or very near the 1.3 mm source, which is 17.\u2032\u2032 4 W, 1\u2032\u2032 S\nof the IRAS position.\nOur NIR images are centered on the centre position of\nthe outflow. Fig. 1 shows the image obtained in the H2\nfilter. Even though this image still contains a contribution\nfrom the continuum, four regions of H2 emission, hereafter called knots k1, k2, k3, and k4 (North to South), are\nclearly distinguishable; they are not present in the Kcont image (not shown). Fig. 2a shows a close-up of the central region of the narrow-band line image; with the dashed\nlines we have tried to suggest how the spots can be aligned\nin pairs and how they may be traced back to the centre of\nthe outflow (which, within the accuracy of the positions is\npresumably coincident with the 1.3 mm source). The lines\nshow that the centers of k1 and k3 are aligned with the\ncenter of the outflow, while the line connecting the origin\nof the flow and the centers of k2 and k4 is slightly offset\nfrom that. This may suggest a change of direction of the\noutflow axis with time.\n\n\f4\n\nF. Massi et al.: Protostellar jets in CB3 and CB230\n\nFig. 4. Results of the TNG/NICS observations of CB230 of the H2 and [FeII]-emission (still including continuum\nemission): (Central panel) A zoom-in on the objects detected in H2 in the core of CB230, with contours to better\noutline the more intense emission. The YSO is indicated by \"A\". (Left) A close-up of the smaller emission object,\nwhich is clearly seen to contain two sources (B1 and B2). The right-hand panel shows the contoured [FeII] emission\n(still including the continuum). A clear difference is seen in the diffuse emission just North of the YSO, with respect\nto the H2 image (central panel); this is the signature of a jet (see Fig. 5).\nThough unbeknownst to us at the time of the observations,\nthe features k1 and k4 in Fig. 2a were already noted in\ndeep NIR images of this region by Launhardt et al. (1998),\nwho remarked that these two diffuse, non-stellar objects\n\"might have H2 -line emission contributing to their K-band\nluminosity\". The fact that these features are not visible in\nour Kcont image confirms that they arise from pure H2 line\nemission. The absolute coordinates of the four H2 knots,\nas well as their integrated flux, are given in Table 2.\nKnot k4 lies at a distance of \u223c 40\u2032\u2032 from the centre of the\noutflow; for an assumed distance of 2.5 kpc (Launhardt\n& Henning 1997) this corresponds to \u223c 0.5 pc. Knot\nk1 is the nearest to the outflow centre, at a distance of\n10\u2032\u2032 \u2248 0.12 pc. All knots are found South of the outflow centre, towards the blue lobe of the molecular outflow\n(Codella & Bachiller 1999). The fast outflow component\nis usually traced by H2 line emission, which originates behind the shocks created where this jet-component interacts with the ambient cloud material. That we do not see\nany H2 spots associated with the red (northern) lobe of\nthe outflow is likely because it is much more embedded in\nthe globule, and the emission is too much obscured to be\nvisible even at the NIR wavelength of H2 .\nCloser inspection of the brightest knots k1 and k4 shows\nthat the emission contours are slightly convex. Together\nwith the knot alignment, and the location of the knots\nalong the outflow axis, this argues in favour of the bow\nshock model for the interaction of a wind from the YSO\nand the ambient medium.\nDownstream from the shocks caused by the interaction of\nthe YSO-wind and the ambient medium, in high-density\nand -temperature gas, one expects to find an enhancement of several molecular species, which are liberated\nfrom the mantles of dust grains and injected into the gas\nphase through endothermic or gas-grain reactions as well\nas through sputtering. Codella & Bachiller (1999) have\n\nshown that the high-velocity component of the outflow in\nCB3 is well-traced by SiO, which is enhanced in the presence of shocks and which is only present along the main\nflow axis. In Fig. 2b we compare the location of the H2\nspots with (blue-shifted) channel maps of the emission of\nSiO(5\u20134). There is a close correspondence between the location of (at least two of) the H2 spots and the peaks of\nthe SiO distribution. This confirms that in CB3 the SiO\nemission is tracing the jet-like flow rather well, and indicates that along the outflow axis different temperature\nregimes coexist: the warm component at \u223c100 K (Codella\n& Bachiller 1999) traced by SiO and a hot (\u22652000 K)\ncomponent revealed by H2 .\nIn Fig. 3 we show the locations of the various tracers of star formation found in this globule, projected\non the narrow-band H2 image. An evolutionary sequence\ncan be distinguished, in that we encounter progressively\nyounger objects when going from the NIR-detected object YC1 (Yun & Clemens 1995), via the sub-mm peaks\n(Huard et al. 2000), to the 1.3 mm peak (Launhardt &\nHenning 1997), which is probably coincident with the centre of the outflow (Codella & Bachiller 1999). This implies\nthat star formation in this globule has been going on for\nsome time. Assuming the IRAS source and the sub-mm\npeaks refer to the same object, the mutual distance between the 3 star formation indicators in Fig. 3 is about\n0.2 pc.\nWe take this opportunity to point out some inconsistencies\nin the original papers regarding the relative positions of\nthe various objects plotted in Fig. 3. First, we note that\nthe object identified as YSO (based on its NIR excess)\nin Yun & Clemens (1995) is different from the one they\nidentified in CB3 in Yun & Clemens 1994a, which is about\n100\u2032\u2032 to the North. And even so, although YC1-I is a bright\nsource (K = 8.24 mag.; Yun & Clemens 1995), it does not\ncoincide with any of the sources in our image \u2013 the nearest\n\n\fF. Massi et al.: Protostellar jets in CB3 and CB230\n\nobject (see Fig. 3) is \u223c 4\u2032\u2032 to the South, much more than\nthe estimated positional accuracy of both our objects and\nYC1-I (\u223c 2\u2032\u2032 ).\nThe relative positions of the Huard et al. (2000) sub-mm\npeak and the IRAS source are incorrect in their Fig. 1:\nbased on the coordinates given by Huard et al. the sub-mm\npeak should be much closer to the IRAS position (\u223c 5\u2032\u2032\nrather than 15\u2032\u2032 ). Although Launhardt & Henning (1997)\ndo not give a positional accuracy for their 1.3 mm peak, it\nis probably similar to that of the sub-mm peak (i.e. \u223c 3\u2032\u2032 ),\nsuggesting that these are different objects.\n\n3.3. CB230\nThis globule also hosts a single IRAS source\n(IRAS21169+6804), which is associated with the YSO\nfound by Yun & Clemens (1994a). The YSO is located at\nthe apex of a cone-shaped nebulosity (see Fig. 4) and is at\nthe centre of a CO outflow (Yun & Clemens 1992; 1994b).\nThe outflow is bipolar, but while the red component\nis quite compact, the blue lobe is more elongated, and\nextends northwards beyond the boundaries of the map\nmade by Yun & Clemens (1994b) (i.e. its length >3\u2032 ). Yun\n& Clemens (1994a) found a second NIR object, \"possibly\nforming a binary system\" together with the YSO at the\nbase of the outflow. In our observations we find this\nsecond NIR object to consist of two nuclei, which would\nmake this a triple system (Fig. 4). The conical nebula\nseen in Fig. 4 has a steep intensity-gradient towards the\nSouth, while towards the North the nebulous light fans\nout and decreases in intensity more gradually. The nebula\nopens up to the North, which is also the direction of the\nblue lobe of the outflow, the axis of which is North-South\n(Yun & Clemens 1994b). The approaching component\nof the bipolar outflow may have cleared out a cavity;\nthe more extended emission seen in the northern part\nof the nebula could then be scattered light from walls\nof this cavity (see Yun & Clemens 1994a). Likewise, the\ndiffuse emission associated with the embedded binary\nobject \u223c 9\u2032\u2032 W of the main nebula is extended towards\nthe SE (see Fig. 4). This might be the signature of an\nas yet undetected (or more likely: unresolved) outflow\nassociated with the objects embedded herein.\nBecause we want to distinguish the (pure) line emission\nfrom the nebular emission, and because the spectral slope\nof the nebulosity differs from that of the field stars, we\nhave determined the slope x of the wavelength dependence of the emission (\u221d \u03bbx ) by using the integrated flux\nof the northern part of the nebula, excluding the region\nwith the embedded star. As we shall see (e.g. Fig. 5) the\nconsequence of this is that in the continuum-subtracted\n[FeII]-image the YSO is still visible. Its spectral index differs from that of the nebula (which is radiation scattered\nby the dust), which we have used to scale the Hcont -image;\nthe YSO cannot therefore be correctly subtracted.\nThe final reduction, with careful scaling of the Hcont - and\nKcont images of the diffuse emission, reveals the pure line\n\n5\n\nemission that remains after subtraction of the continuum,\nand is shown in Fig. 5: a jet is seen in [FeII], primarily defined by two knots along its length: a bright one at the tip\n(hereafter called k1) and a fainter one (k2) about half-way\nbetween k1 and the YSO. The knots are superimposed on\na fainter, but clearly visible elongated emission feature.\nWe stress that this detection is independent of potential\ninaccuracies in the continuum subtraction, as the knots\nare visible in the contours of the [FeII] image before continuum subtraction (cf. Fig. 4), but not at all in the (Hcont )\ncontinuum image alone.\nThe jet is oriented in the N-S direction, and lies at the\nbase of the large-scale molecular outflow. This jet is also\ntraced by H2 emission (Fig. 5b), which is weaker and\nslightly less narrow than that of [FeII]. Moreover, the H2\nemission appears to be anti-correlated with [FeII] peaking next to, rather than on the secondary knot in [FeII],\nand we conclude that in H2 we probably see the walls of\nthe jet-channel. The detection of strong [FeII]- and weaker\nH2 emission suggests the presence of fast, dissociative Jshocks.\nThe total length of the jet, from its base at the location\nof the embedded YSO to the edge of knot k1 is about 9.\n\u2032\u2032\n5, corresponding to \u223c 0.02 pc at the assumed distance of\n450 pc (Launhardt & Henning 1997). Profiles of the knots\nin the [FeII]-jet, along cuts made at constant declination\noffsets and passing through the location of peak intensity\nof the knots, are shown in Fig. 5c. Both features are resolved in the NIR image. The width (FWHM) of k1 is 1.\u2032\u2032 2\ncorresponding to \u223c 540 AU. In the profile of k2 one can\nalso identify the two intensity enhancements to the East\nand West, seen in Fig. 5a, which deliniate the edges of the\nconical nebula. Both knots are superimposed on a broad\n(\u223c 17\u2032\u2032 \u2248 0.04 pc) plateau of emission; this is an artifact\ndue to imperfect mosaicing, rendering the middle section\nof the image (in which the nebula and the jet are located)\nmore noisy than the edges. The absolute coordinates of\nthe three stellar objects (A, B1, and B2; Fig. 4) and of\nthe two knots (k1, k2; Fig. 5a) in the [FeII]-jet are given\nin table 2, where we also list the integrated fluxes of the\ntwo [FeII]-knots and the entire H2 jet.\nIn addition to the main jet, a second [FeII]-feature is seen,\nemanating from the bright nebulosity and oriented in a NNW-direction; this may indicate the existence of a second\n(unresolved) outflow, or it is a shock at the surface of the\ncavity, and thus related to the main jet.\n\n3.4. CB188\nIn this globule, Launhardt & Henning (1997) detected\n1.3 mm continuum emission, in the form of an \"extended\nsource with compact components\" at the location of the\nIRAS source (indicated by the ellipse in Fig. 6). A YSO\nwas detected at the same location by Yun & Clemens\n(1995), while Yun & Clemens (1994b) mapped a small\n(\u2264 2\u2032 ) outflow, of which the less extended blue lobe overlaps the red one.\n\n\f6\n\nF.

Most of the elevated emission plateau between about \u22128\u2032\u2032 and + 9\u2032\u2032 is an artifact of the mosaicing\ntogether of the different frames constituting the final image.\n\nFig. 6.

The locations of the IRAS point sources are indicated by their uncertainty\nellipses. The upper small panel on the far right shows a blow-up of the region around the IRAS source position in\nCB205. The lower small panel on the far right shows the alleged jet-like feature (Yun et al. 1993) being resolved into\nstars.\nOur continuum-subtracted H2 and [FeII]-images do not\nshow any line emission in the field down to the sensitivity\nlimit. We also do not see the cometary diffuse emission\naround the possible NIR counterpart of the IRAS source\nthat was found by Yun & Clemens (1994a; this would be\nthe bright star seen just outside the IRAS error ellipse in\nFig. 6), nor do we detect their source F, which they find\nembedded in this diffuse emission (see their Fig. 10b). It\nmight be either a spurious detection or a variable object.\n\n3.5. CB205\nThis globule, also known as L810, has an extended NIR\nnebulosity at the location of the IRAS source, as seen in\nFig. 6. A NIR star cluster is associated with it; at least\n10 stars can be seen within 10\u2032\u2032 of the IRAS position (see\nthe top-inset of Fig. 6).\n\nThe major axis of the nebula is oriented in a N-S direction,\nwhich is also the orientation of the compact molecular outflow detected by Yun & Clemens (1994b), of which the red\nand blue lobes show a significant overlap. This coincidence\nof orientations suggests a connection between the shape of\nthe nebula and the presence of the outflow. However, no\nline emission has been found in our continuum-subtracted\nimages, although we cannot rule out that some line emission knots may have been hidden in the more intense parts\nof the diffuse NIR nebulosity, near the IRAS point source\nlocation.\nThe nebula has been studied in the NIR (J,H,K) by Yun et\nal. (1993). The object they identified as the illuminator of\nthe nebula, L810IRS, coincides with our star B in Fig. 6.\nYun et al. (1993) also report the detection of an elongated\njet-like feature, located about 35\u2032\u2032 from L810IRS, to the\nSW. This feature is also visible in all our images (both line\n\n\fF.

Summary\nWe have used NICS at the TNG to search for jetcomponents associated with molecular outflows in four\nglobules, by imaging through narrow-band filters centered\nat [FeII] and H2 and the adjacent continuum. Jets can\nbe revealed, if present, after subtracting the scaled continuum emission from the image taken through the line\nfilters. In two of our targets, CB3 and CB230, this led to\nthe identification of regions of pure line emission, while\nnothing was found in CB188 and CB205.\nIn CB3 we found four regions (\"knots\") of H2 emission.\nAll of these are located in the southern, blue lobe of the\nmolecular outflow, which is probably driven by the 1.3 mm\nsource located very near the center of the outflow. There\nis a close correspondence between the location of the H2 knots and the peaks in the SiO(5\u22124) emission (Codella\n& Bachiller 1999). The knots likely identify the locations\nwhere the jet-component of the outflow hits and shocks\nthe ambient gas.\nThe relative locations of various signposts of star formation (embedded NIR source, IRAS point source, sub-mm\nand mm-peaks, and the outflow) suggest that star formation has been active for some time in this globule, and is\nprogressing from East to West in CB3.\nIn CB230 we find a jet emerging from a conical nebulosity\nin which a YSO is embedded. The jet is oriented N-S, in\nthe same direction as the large-scale molecular outflow. In\nthe [FeII]-line the jet consists of two knots, the brighter\none of which lies at its tip. Its length from the YSO at\nits base to its tip is about 0.02 pc (for d = 450 pc). The\nknots are superimposed on a substrate of lower-level dif-\n\nReferences\nAllen D.A., Burton M.G., 1993, Nature 363, 54\nBachiller R., 1996, ARA&A 34, 111\nBaffa C., Comoretto G., Gennari S., et al., 2001, A&A 378,\n722\nClemens D.P., Barvainis R.E., 1988, ApJS 68, 257 [CB]\nCodella C., Bachiller R., 1999, A&A 350, 659\nHuard T.L., Weintraub D.A., Sandell G., 2000, A&A 362, 635\nHunt L.K., Mannucci F., Testi L., et al., 1998, ApJ 115, 2594\nLaunhardt R., Henning Th., 1997, A&A 326, 329\nLaunhardt R., Henning Th., Klein R., 1998, in \"Star formation\nwith the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO)\" (eds.
