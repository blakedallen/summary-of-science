[1] tried to compose the H \u2212 T phase diagram of anisotropic superconductors based on\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0303087v2 [cond-mat.supr-con] 7 May 2003\n\nthe Lindemann criterion for melting of flux-line lattice. It is worthy to notice that the issue itself is interesting.\nHowever, their conclusion on the existence of a smectic vortex phase is unphysical for the following reasons: There\nis no appropriate estimate on thermal fluctuations above the \"lower melting temperature\", since the basis of the\n\nelastic theory used by the authors, namely the lattice structure, disappears already; One therefore cannot argue\neven the existence of the intermediate phase, such as smectic in Fig. 1 of Ref.[1], above the \"lower melting\ntemperature\", not only its melting as noticed by the authors.\nIt is interesting to ask if one can draw useful information from a Lindemann-type argument for melting phenomena in uniaxially anisotropic superconductors when the magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the anisotropic\naxis. An idea is to suppose that one can have two Lindemann numbers in the two different directions, instead of\ntwo meltings. From the elastic theory (see references in Ref.[1]), we know that the Lindemann melting line is given\n\u221a\nby the following equation: t/ 1 \u2212 t = c2 \u00d7 f (b, \u03ba, \u03b3, Gi). This property permits us to shift the \"upper melting\n\nline\" in Fig. 4 of Ref.[1] to lower temperature by reducing the Lindemann number without touching the details of\nf (b, \u03ba, \u03b3, Gi) [2]. The numerical results thus obtained are shown in Fig. 1. There is a perfect collapse between the\ntwo curves when one takes clong \u2243 0.17 while fixes cshort = 0.2 to the value chosen in Ref.[1]. The collapse of the\n\ntwo curves is expected for large \u03ba's, namely in extremely type II superconductors, and is achieved whenever the\ntwo Lindemann numbers satisfy the fixed ratio which is revealed in our analysis.\nShould the \"two melting lines\" never collapse, there appears another possible melting scenario. One could have\nan intersection between these \"two melting lines\", besides the ones at T = Tc , H = 0 and T = 0, H = Hc2 . Then,\nthe lower melting temperature should be adopted as the true one at a given magnetic field to form a single melting\nline. The \"intersecting point\" could be a triple point: the melting mechanism below and above the triple magnetic\nfield Ht is different; there may be two liquids separated by another first-order line, which terminates at a critical\npoint where the two liquids become identical.\nThere exists of course the possibility of an intermediate phase in the H \u2212 T phase diagram (see for example\n\n[3]). Its identification is beyond the Lindemann-type phenomenological argument. Although terminologies of\nsuperconductivity have been used in the present discussions, it is obvious that the results are applicable to a wide\nrange of melting phenomena.\nThis study is partially supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan,\nunder the Priority Grant No. 14038240.\n\nXiao Hu and Qing-Hu Chen\nComputational Materials Science Center\nNational Institute for Materials Science\nTsukuba 305-0047, Japan\nReceived March 5 2003\nPACS numbers: 74.25.Op, 61.30.-v, 74.25.Qt\n\n\fReferences\n[1] E.
