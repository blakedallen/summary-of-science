Introduction\nThe \u039b(1405) is a well-established hyperon resonance located just below NK threshold. Even\nthough its existence has been known since the 1960's and it holds a four-star rating in the\nPDG [1], its nature as a resonance is not well understood. The \u039b(1405) can only be seen\nby reconstructing the invariant mass of the \u03a3\u03c0 system into which it decays. Previous experiments [2, 3] have shown this mass distribution, or \"lineshape\" to be distorted from the usual\nBreit-Wigner resonance form, leading to various speculations on the nature of the \u039b(1405).\nUsing the CLAS [4] detector system in Hall B at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator\nLaboratory, we have done a photoproduction measurement of the \u039b(1405). Due to the high\nstatistics of the experiment and good resolution of the CLAS system, we were able to extract the\nlineshapes and differential cross sections of the \u039b(1405) in all three of its \u03a3\u03c0 decay modes. The\nlineshapes and cross sections will give a much improved quantitative description of the \u039b(1405),\nand will lead to further insights into its nature and production mechanism.\n2. Theory of the \u039b(1405) Mass Distribution\nIn recent years, theoretical progress in chiral dynamics in the S = \u22121 sector has gained much\nattention, and has been extended to include a description of the \u039b(1405). In this approach the\n\u039b(1405) is dynamically generated by iterating over the meson-baryon interactions among the\nground state baryon octet and psuedoscalar mesons octet. A paper by Nacher et al. [5] predicts,\nusing a chiral unitary approach, the lineshapes of the \u039b(1405) as it decays to its three \u03a3\u03c0 decay\nmodes. Figure 1 shows the predicted lineshapes, a result of the isospin 0 and 1 amplitudes\nPreprint submitted to Nuclear Physics A\n\nSeptember 30, 2018\n\n\fFigure 1: Theoretical lineshapes predicted [5]\nfor the \u039b(1405) using the chiral unitary approach. Due to the interfering isospin 0 and 1\nterms, the lineshapes are distorted from a simple\nBreit-Wigner form. In more recent years, attention has also focused on the possible two pole\nstructure of the \u039b(1405) in the I = 0 channel\nalone. This too is expected to influence the lineshapes [6].\n\ninterfering to produce shifts in the \u03a3+ \u03c0\u2212 and \u03a3\u2212 \u03c0+ lineshapes in opposite directions. Unlike an\nordinary resonance where the lineshape will follow a simple Breit-Wigner form, the \u039b(1405)\nspectrum is predicted to be strongly distorted due to a mixture of contributions. This figure\nhas been the starting point in our analysis, and our work has been focused on comparing our\nexperimental data with this prediction.\n3. Data Analysis Using CLAS\nIn this section we show some of the work that was done at CLAS to study the photoproduction\nof the \u039b(1405). The reaction of interest at CLAS is \u03b3 + p \u2192 K + + \u039b(1405), with the \u039b(1405)\ndecaying exclusively into \u03a3\u03c0. The CLAS data set was obtained in 2004 using tagged real photons\nup to 3.84 GeV, and a two charged track trigger. For the \u03a3+ \u03c0\u2212 decay mode, there are two possible\ndecays for the \u03a3+ , i.e. to p\u03c00 or n \u03c0+ . The first step of the analysis is to select either (p, K + , \u03c0\u2212 ) or\n(K + , \u03c0+ , \u03c0\u2212 ) events.\nAfter the three charged particles are selected and identified using momentum and TOF information, the missing mass of the event is calculated to obtain the missing particle(s). Figure 2(a)\nshows an example of the missing mass squared (MM2 ) for one bin of our analysis. A Gaussian\nfit to the neutron peak had a \u00b13\u03c3 cut applied. Next, we combine our final state particles to reconstruct the intermediate ground state hyperon that the reaction went through. In Figure 2(b) we\nshow the result of plotting the invariant masses squared of the (n, \u03c0+ ) versus (n, \u03c0\u2212 ). Again a fit\nwas done and a region of \u00b12\u03c3 was selected around each peak; the \u03a3 overlap region was excluded\nas well.\nAt this stage we are ready to fit our resulting \u03a3\u03c0 spectrum as a sum of templates of Monte\nCarlo (MC) spectra. The MC were initially generated with mass and width values given in the\nPDG [1] and processed through the standard CLAS simulation package to account for detection\nineffeciencies. After this fitting process, the non-\u039b(1405) contributions were subtracted off from\nthe data and the \"residual\" spectrum was taken to be from the \u039b(1405). The resulting lineshape\nwas then acceptance corrected bin by bin in mass. The final lineshape spectrum was then obtained\nby summing over all the production angle bins in each energy bin. Our final lineshapes are thus\nshown this way, acceptance corrected and summed over all production angles.\nOnce the above process of fitting and obtaining the lineshapes in each energy bin was completed, the resulting lineshapes were then used as input to generate MC templates for the \u039b(1405),\nso that the process could be iterated and refined. The fit result in one sample bin is shown in Figure 3(a) for the iterated version.\n2\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2: (Color online) (a) The missing mass squared (MM2 ) calculated for one energy and angle bin for the reaction\n\u03b3 + p \u2192 K + + \u03c0+ + \u03c0\u2212 + X, where X denotes the missing particle(s). The neutron peak is clearly seen. The fit result\nof a Gaussian (red line) and a polynomial background (green line) are also shown. The \u00b13\u03c3 range of the fit is shown\nwith the red dashed lines. (b) M 2 (n, \u03c0+ ) vs M 2 (n, \u03c0\u2212 ) for a particular bin when detecting K + , \u03c0+ , \u03c0\u2212 and reconstructing\nthe missing neutron. The horizontal band corresponds to \u03a3+ events, and the vertical band to \u03a3\u2212 events. A faint diagonal\nband of neutral kaons decaying to \u03c0+ ,\u03c0\u2212 is also seen. \u00b12\u03c3 selection cuts are shown for each hyperon.\n\n4. Results\nAfter the iteration of the fit, the mass distribution we obtained is shown in Figure 3(b) for one\nenergy bin near threshold of the \u039b(1405). Our lineshape result is shown for the three different\ncharge combinations \u03a3+ \u03c0\u2212 (red), \u03a30 \u03c00 (blue), and \u03a3\u2212 \u03c0+ (green). The \u03a3+ \u03c0\u2212 spectrum is a weighted\naverage of the two different decay channels of the \u03a3+ . The difference in the lineshapes is clear,\nwith the \u03a3+ \u03c0\u2212 spectrum peaking at the highest mass, and having a much sharper structure than\nthe \u03a3\u2212 \u03c0+ spectrum.\nA comparison of our experimental result can be done with the theoretical prediction (Figure 1). Although the lineshapes differ from each other as predicted, we see that for the theory\nprediction, the \u03a3\u2212 \u03c0+ spectrum is shifted toward the higher mass, whereas this applies to the \u03a3+ \u03c0\u2212\nspectrum in our experimental result. The difference in the two charged decay modes, according\nto the theory, is based on an interference between isospin I = 0 and I = 1 terms, as shown in [5].\nAt the moment, this \"interchange\" of lineshapes is an unresolved issue that we hope to resolve\nin future studies.\n5. Future Prospects and Conclusion\nThe mass distributions of the \u039b(1405) have been obtained in nine different energy bins, and\nalthough much work has been put into obtaining these, there is still room for improvement. One\nexample of prospective work is using the kinematic fitter that was developed for CLAS. The\nresults shown here do not utilize the kinematic fitter, but our preliminary studies show that our\nresolution is readily improved when using it.\nPreliminary differential cross sections for the \u039b(1405) were also shown during the presentation, which were obtained by summing over each lineshape in each energy and angle bin. The\nvalues of this d\u03c3\ndt showed differences between the different charge combinations, not just in scale\nbut also in dependence on t. The nature of this different t-dependence for each decay mode is\nunknown.\n3\n\n\f2.150 <W< 2.250 -0.420<t<-0.280\n500\n\ndata\n\"nominal\" \u039b(1405) MC\n\n400\n\n\u039b(1520) MC\nK*0 \u03a3+ MC\n\u03a3(1385) MC\n\n200\n\nsum of MC\n\ncounts\n\n300\n\n100\n\n0\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\n\u03a3 \u03c0 Invariant Mass (GeV)\n\n1.7\n\n1.8\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3: (Color online) (a) Sample of fit to M(\u03a3\u03c0) spectrum in one bin of the \u03a3+ \u2192 n\u03c0+ decay mode.

This figure is for the iterated version of the fit, see text for details. (b) The final\n\u039b(1405) lineshape result that we obtained for one energy bin near threshold. The three different lineshapes are plotted\nagainst each other. Stark differences are observed, especially between the two charged decay modes. The dashed line is\na relativistic Breit-Wigner shape using the nominal values of mass and width of the \u039b(1405) given in the PDG. Notice\nthat although the \u03a3+ \u03c0\u2212 threshold is lower than that of \u03a3\u2212 \u03c0+ , the \u03a3\u2212 \u03c0+ spectrum appears at a lower mass.\n\nAnother prospect for our analysis is direct experimental evidence for the spin and parity of\n\u2212\nthe \u039b(1405). Although the majority of theories assume J P = 21 , no direct experimental proof\nfor these quantum numbers has been given [7]. Our preliminary analysis shows a detectable\npolarization for the \u039b(1405), which is transferred to the \u03a3+ , allowing us to infer its spin and\nparity. Our results are consistent with the common expectation, but will nontheless be an important step in identifying the nature of the \u039b(1405). Also, it should be noted that from these\nmeasurements the polarization of the \u039b(1405) is measured, giving further information about its\nproduction mechanism.\nIn conclusion, an overview of the CLAS analysis of the \u039b(1405) has been given. We have\nan unprecedented high statistics data set for the \u039b(1405), and have obtained the lineshapes and\ndifferential cross sections in energy bins spanning from threshold up to 2.84 GeV in the overall\ncenter of mass energy. We observe a difference in the different decay mode lineshapes, leading\nto a difference in the differential cross sections. We have just started comparing our results to\ntheory, and are eager to finalize our results in the coming months.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n\nC. Amsler et al.
