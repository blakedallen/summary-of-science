The combination (fusion) of information\narises in many fields of applications nowadays (especially in defense, medicine, finance, geo-science, economy,\netc). When several sensors, observers or experts have to be combined together to solve a problem, or if one\nwants to update our current estimation of solutions for a given problem with some new information available,\nwe need powerful and solid mathematical tools for the fusion, specially when the information one has to deal\nwith is imprecise and uncertain. In this paper, we present a survey of our recent theory of plausible and\nparadoxical reasoning, known as Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) in the literature, developed for dealing\nwith imprecise, uncertain and conflicting sources of information. Recent publications have shown the interest\nand the ability of DSmT to solve problems where other approaches fail, especially when conflict between\nsources becomes high. We focus this presentation rather on the foundations of DSmT, and on the main important\nrules of combination, than on browsing specific applications of DSmT available in literature. Several simple\nexamples are given throughout the presentation to show the efficiency and the generality of DSmT.\n\n2\n\nFoundations of DSmT\n\nThe development of DSmT (Dezert-Smarandache Theory of plausible and paradoxical reasoning [8, 31]) arises\nfrom the necessity to overcome the inherent limitations of DST (Dempster-Shafer Theory [24]) which are\nclosely related with the acceptance of Shafer's model for the fusion problem under consideration (i.e. the frame\nof discernment \u0398 is implicitly defined as a finite set of exhaustive and exclusive hypotheses \u03b8i , i = 1, . . . , n\nsince the masses of belief are defined only on the power set of \u0398 - see section 2.1 for details), the third middle excluded principle (i.e. the existence of the complement for any elements/propositions belonging to the power set\nof \u0398), and the acceptance of Dempster's rule of combination (involving normalization) as the framework for the\ncombination of independent sources of evidence. Discussions on limitations of DST and presentation of some\nThis paper is based on the first chapter of [36].\n\n\falternative rules to Dempster's rule of combination can be found in [11,15,17\u201319,21,23,31,38,46,49,50,53\u201356]\nand therefore they will be not reported in details in this introduction. We argue that these three fundamental\nconditions of DST can be removed and another new mathematical approach for combination of evidence is\npossible. This is the purpose of DSmT.\nThe basis of DSmT is the refutation of the principle of the third excluded middle and Shafer's model, since\nfor a wide class of fusion problems the intrinsic nature of hypotheses can be only vague and imprecise in such\na way that precise refinement is just impossible to obtain in reality so that the exclusive elements \u03b8i cannot\nbe properly identified and precisely separated. Many problems involving fuzzy continuous and relative concepts described in natural language and having no absolute interpretation like tallness/smallness, pleasure/pain,\ncold/hot, Sorites paradoxes, etc, enter in this category. DSmT starts with the notion of free DSm model, denoted Mf (\u0398), and considers \u0398 only as a frame of exhaustive elements \u03b8i , i = 1, . . . , n which can potentially\noverlap. This model is free because no other assumption is done on the hypotheses, but the weak exhaustivity\nconstraint which can always be satisfied according the closure principle explained in [31]. No other constraint\nis involved in the free DSm model. When the free DSm model holds, the classic commutative and associative\nclassical DSm rule of combination, denoted DSmC, corresponding to the conjunctive consensus defined on the\nfree Dedekind's lattice is performed.\nDepending on the intrinsic nature of the elements of the fusion problem under consideration, it can however\nhappen that the free model does not fit the reality because some subsets of \u0398 can contain elements known to\nbe truly exclusive but also truly non existing at all at a given time (specially when working on dynamic fusion\nproblem where the frame \u0398 varies with time with the revision of the knowledge available). These integrity\nconstraints are then explicitly and formally introduced into the free DSm model Mf (\u0398) in order to adapt it\nproperly to fit as close as possible with the reality and permit to construct a hybrid DSm model M(\u0398) on which\nthe combination will be efficiently performed. Shafer's model, denoted M0 (\u0398), corresponds to a very specific\nhybrid DSm model including all possible exclusivity constraints. DST has been developed for working only\nwith M0 (\u0398) while DSmT has been developed for working with any kind of hybrid model (including Shafer's\nmodel and the free DSm model), to manage as efficiently and precisely as possible imprecise, uncertain and\npotentially high conflicting sources of evidence while keeping in mind the possible dynamicity of the information fusion problematic. The foundations of DSmT are therefore totally different from those of all existing\napproaches managing uncertainties, imprecisions and conflicts. DSmT provides a new interesting way to attack\nthe information fusion problematic with a general framework in order to cover a wide variety of problems.\nDSmT refutes also the idea that sources of evidence provide their beliefs with the same absolute interpretation of elements of the same frame \u0398 and the conflict between sources arises not only because of the possible\nunreliability of sources, but also because of possible different and relative interpretation of \u0398, e.g. what is\nconsidered as good for somebody can be considered as bad for somebody else. There is some unavoidable\nsubjectivity in the belief assignments provided by the sources of evidence, otherwise it would mean that all\nbodies of evidence have a same objective and universal interpretation (or measure) of the phenomena under\nconsideration, which unfortunately rarely occurs in reality, but when basic belief assignments (bba's) are based\non some objective probabilities transformations. But in this last case, probability theory can handle properly\nand efficiently the information, and DST, as well as DSmT, becomes useless. If we now get out of the probabilistic background argumentation for the construction of bba, we claim that in most of cases, the sources of\nevidence provide their beliefs about elements of the frame of the fusion problem only based on their own limited\nknowledge and experience without reference to the (inaccessible) absolute truth of the space of possibilities.\nSeveral successful applications of DSmT (in target tracking, satellite surveillance, situation analysis, robotics,\nmedicine, etc) can be found in [31, 34].\n\n2.1\n\nThe power set, hyper-power set and super-power set\n\nIn DSmT, we take very care of the model associated with the set \u0398 of hypotheses where the solution of the\nproblem is assumed to belong to. In particular, the three main sets (power set, hyper-power set and super-power\nset) can be used depending on their ability to fit adequately with the nature of hypotheses. In the following, we\n\n\fassume that \u0398 = {\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n } is a finite set (called frame) of n exhaustive elements1 . If \u0398 = {\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n }\nis a priori not closed (\u0398 is said to be an open world/frame), one can always include in it a closure element,\nsay \u03b8n+1 in such away that we can work with a new closed world/frame {\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n , \u03b8n+1 }. So without loss\nof generality, we will always assume that we work in a closed world by considering the frame \u0398 as a finite\nset of exhaustive elements. Before introducing the power set, the hyper-power set and the super-power set it is\nnecessary to recall that subsets are regarded as propositions in Dempster-Shafer Theory (see Chapter 2 of [24])\nand we adopt the same approach in DSmT.\n\u2022 Subsets as propositions: Glenn Shafer in pages 35\u201337 of [24] considers the subsets as propositions in\nthe case we are concerned with the true value of some quantity \u03b8 taking its possible values in \u0398. Then\nthe propositions P\u03b8 (A) of interest are those of the form2 :\nP\u03b8 (A) , The true value of \u03b8 is in a subset A of \u0398.\nAny proposition P\u03b8 (A) is thus in one-to-one correspondence with the subset A of \u0398. Such correspondence is very useful since it translates the logical notions of conjunction \u2227, disjunction \u2228, implication \u21d2\nand negation \u00ac into the set-theoretic notions of intersection \u2229, union \u222a, inclusion \u2282 and complementation c(.). Indeed, if P\u03b8 (A) and P\u03b8 (B) are two propositions corresponding to subsets A and B of \u0398, then\nthe conjunction P\u03b8 (A)\u2227P\u03b8 (B) corresponds to the intersection A\u2229B and the disjunction P\u03b8 (A)\u2228P\u03b8 (B)\ncorresponds to the union A \u222a B. A is a subset of B if and only if P\u03b8 (A) \u21d2 P\u03b8 (B) and A is the settheoretic complement of B with respect to \u0398 (written A = c\u0398 (B)) if and only if P\u03b8 (A) = \u00acP\u03b8 (B). In\nother words, the following equivalences are then used between the operations on the subsets and on the\npropositions:\nOperations\nIntersection/conjunction\nUnion/disjunction\nInclusion/implication\nComplementation/negation\n\nSubsets\nA\u2229B\nA\u222aB\nA\u2282B\nA = c\u0398 (B)\n\nPropositions\nP\u03b8 (A) \u2227 P\u03b8 (B)\nP\u03b8 (A) \u2228 P\u03b8 (B)\nP\u03b8 (A) \u21d2 P\u03b8 (B)\nP\u03b8 (A) = \u00acP\u03b8 (B)\n\nTable 1: Correspondence between operations on subsets and on propositions.\n\u2022 Canonical form of a proposition: In DSmT we consider all propositions/sets in a canonical form. We\ntake the disjunctive normal form, which is a disjunction of conjunctions, and it is unique in Boolean\nalgebra and simplest. For example, X = A \u2229 B \u2229 (A \u222a B \u222a C) it is not in a canonical form, but we\nsimplify the formula and X = A \u2229 B is in a canonical form.\n\u2022 The power set: 2\u0398 , (\u0398, \u222a)\nAside Dempster's rule of combination, the power set is one of the corner stones of Dempster-Shafer Theory\n(DST) since the basic belief assignments to combine are defined on the power set of the frame \u0398. In mathematics, given a set \u0398, the power set of \u0398, written 2\u0398 , is the set of all subsets of \u0398. In ZFC axiomatic set theory,\nthe existence of the power set of any set is postulated by the axiom of power set. In other words, \u0398 generates\nthe power set 2\u0398 with the \u222a (union) operator only.\n\n1\n\nWe do not assume here that elements \u03b8i are necessary exclusive, unless specified. There is no restriction on \u03b8i but the\nexhaustivity.\n2\nWe use the symbol , to mean equals by definition; the right-hand side of the equation is the definition of the left-hand\nside.\n\n\fMore precisely, the power set 2\u0398 is defined as the set of all composite propositions/subsets built from\nelements of \u0398 with \u222a operator such that:\n1. \u2205, \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n \u2208 2\u0398 .\n2. If A, B \u2208 2\u0398 , then A \u222a B \u2208 2\u0398 .\n3.

Let \u0398 = {\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n } be a finite set (called frame) of n exhaustive elements. The hyper-power set\nD \u0398 is defined as the set of all composite propositions/subsets built from elements of \u0398 with \u222a and \u2229 operators\nsuch that:\n1. \u2205, \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n \u2208 D \u0398 .\n2. If A, B \u2208 D \u0398 , then A \u2229 B \u2208 D \u0398 and A \u222a B \u2208 D \u0398 .\n3. No other elements belong to D \u0398 , except those obtained by using rules 1 or 2.\n\n\fTherefore by convention, we write D \u0398 = (\u0398, \u222a, \u2229) which means that \u0398 generates D \u0398 under operators \u222a\nand \u2229. The dual (obtained by switching \u222a and \u2229 in expressions) of D \u0398 is itself. There are elements in D \u0398\nwhich are self-dual (dual to themselves), for example \u03b18 for the case when n = 3 in the following example.\nn\nThe cardinality of D \u0398 is majored by 22 when the cardinality of \u0398 equals n, i.e. |\u0398| = n. The generation\nof hyper-power set D \u0398 is closely related with the famous Dedekind's problem [3, 4] on enumerating the set\nof isotone Boolean functions. The generation of the hyper-power set is presented in [31]. Since for any given\nfinite set \u0398, |D \u0398 | \u2265 |2\u0398 | we call D \u0398 the hyper-power set of \u0398.\nExample of the first hyper-power sets:\n\u2022 For the degenerate case (n = 0) where \u0398 = {}, one has D \u0398 = {\u03b10 , \u2205} and |D \u0398 | = 1.\n\u2022 When \u0398 = {\u03b81 }, one has D \u0398 = {\u03b10 , \u2205, \u03b11 , \u03b81 } and |D \u0398 | = 2.\n\u2022 When \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 }, one has D \u0398 = {\u03b10 , \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b14 } and |D \u0398 | = 5 with \u03b10 , \u2205, \u03b11 , \u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 ,\n\u03b12 , \u03b81 , \u03b13 , \u03b82 and \u03b14 , \u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 .\n\u2022 When \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 }, one has D \u0398 = {\u03b10 , \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b118 } and |D \u0398 | = 19 with\n\u03b10\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n\u03b13\n\u03b14\n\u03b15\n\u03b16\n\u03b17\n\u03b18\n\u03b19\n\n,\u2205\n, \u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 \u2229 \u03b83\n, \u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82\n, \u03b81 \u2229 \u03b83\n, \u03b82 \u2229 \u03b83\n, (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) \u2229 \u03b83\n, (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b83 ) \u2229 \u03b82\n, (\u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 ) \u2229 \u03b81\n, (\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 ) \u222a (\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b83 ) \u222a (\u03b82 \u2229 \u03b83 )\n, \u03b81\n\n\u03b110\n\u03b111\n\u03b112\n\u03b113\n\u03b114\n\u03b115\n\u03b116\n\u03b117\n\u03b118\n\n, \u03b82\n, \u03b83\n, (\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 ) \u222a \u03b83\n, (\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b83 ) \u222a \u03b82\n, (\u03b82 \u2229 \u03b83 ) \u222a \u03b81\n, \u03b81 \u222a \u03b82\n, \u03b81 \u222a \u03b83\n, \u03b82 \u222a \u03b83\n, \u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 \u222a \u03b83\n\nThe cardinality of hyper-power set D \u0398 for n \u2265 1 follows the sequence of Dedekind's numbers [26], i.e.\n1,2,5,19,167, 7580,7828353,... and analytical expression of Dedekind's numbers has been obtained recently\nby Tombak in [45] (see [31] for details on generation and ordering of D \u0398 ).

Therefore,\nworking on power set 2\u0398 as Glenn Shafer has proposed in his Mathematical Theory of Evidence [24]) is\nequivalent to work on hyper-power set D \u0398 with the assumption that all elements of the frame are exclusive.\nThis is what we call Shafer's model of the frame \u0398, written M0 (\u0398), even if such model/assumption has not\nbeen clearly stated explicitly by Shafer himself in his milestone book.\n\u2022 The super-power set: S \u0398 , (\u0398, \u222a, \u2229, c(.))\nThe notion of super-power set has been introduced by Smarandache in the Chapter 8 of [34]. It corresponds\nactually to the theoretical construction of the power set of the minimal3 refined frame \u0398ref of \u0398. \u0398 generates\nS \u0398 under operators \u222a, \u2229 and complementation c(.). S \u0398 = (\u0398, \u222a, \u2229, c(.)) is a Boolean algebra with respect to\nthe union, intersection and complementation. Therefore working with the super-power set is equivalent to work\nwith a minimal theoretical refined frame \u0398ref satisfying Shafer's model. More precisely, S \u0398 is defined as the\nset of all composite propositions/subsets built from elements of \u0398 with \u222a, \u2229 and c(.) operators such that:\n1. \u2205, \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n \u2208 S \u0398 .\n2. If A, B \u2208 S \u0398 , then A \u2229 B \u2208 S \u0398 , A \u222a B \u2208 S \u0398 .\n3. If A \u2208 S \u0398 , then c(A) \u2208 S \u0398 .\n4. No other elements belong to S \u0398 , except those obtained by using rules 1, 2 and 3.\n3\n\nThe minimality refers here to the cardinality of the refined frames.\n\n\fAs reported in [32], a similar generalization has been previously used in 1993 by Guan and Bell [14] for the\nDempster-Shafer rule using propositions in sequential logic and reintroduced in 1994 by Paris in his book [20],\npage 4.\nExample of a super-power set:\nLet's consider the frame \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 } and let's assume \u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 6= \u2205, i.e. \u03b81 and \u03b82 are not disjoint according\nto Fig. 1 where A , p1 denotes the part of \u03b81 belonging only to \u03b81 (p stands here for part), B , p2 denotes the\npart of \u03b82 belonging only to \u03b82 and C , p12 denotes the part of \u03b81 and \u03b82 belonging to both. In this example,\nS \u0398={\u03b81 ,\u03b82 } is then given by\nS \u0398 = {\u2205, \u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 , \u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 , c(\u2205), c(\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 ), c(\u03b81 ), c(\u03b82 ), c(\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 )}\nwhere c(.) is the complement in \u0398. Since c(\u2205) = \u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 and c(\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = \u2205, the super-power set is actually\ngiven by\nS \u0398 = {\u2205, \u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 , \u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 , c(\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 ), c(\u03b81 ), c(\u03b82 )}\nLet's now consider the minimal refinement \u0398ref = {A, B, C} of \u0398 built by splitting the granules \u03b81 and\n\u03b82 depicted on the previous Venn diagram into disjoint parts (i.e. \u0398ref satisfies the Shafer's model) as follows:\n\u0398\n.............................\n...............................\n................\n......... ......................\n.........\n........\n............\n.......\n.......\n.\n......\n......\n...... ..........\n......\n.....\n.....\n......\n.....\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n...\n... 2\n...\n1.........\n.\n.\n.\n...\n.\n...\n..\n...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n...\n...\n...\n...\n.\n.\n.\n...\n...\n..\n..\n.\n...\n.\n.\n...\n..\n..\n...\n.\n.\n.\n...\n.\n.\n...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n...\n..\n.....\n....\n..\n...\n...\n....\n...\n..\n..\n..\n...\n....\n..\n..\n...\n...\n...\n....\n....\n..\n1\n12\n2\n...\n.\n..\n...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n...\n..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n...\n...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n..\n..\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n...\n...\n..\n..\n...\n...\n...\n...\n....\n....\n...\n....\n....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n...... ..........\n.\n......\n.\n.\n.\n.. ..\n...\n.......\n............\n.......\n.........\n..............\n......... ......................\n.........\n...............................\n...............................\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b8\n\nA,p\n\nC,p\n\nB,p\n\nFig. 1: Venn diagram of a free DSm model for a 2D frame.\n\n\u03b81 = A \u222a C,\n\n\u03b82 = B \u222a C,\n\n\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 = C\n\nThen the classical power set of \u0398ref is given by\n2\u0398\n\nref\n\n= {\u2205, A, B, C, A \u222a B, A \u222a C, B \u222a C, A \u222a B \u222a C}\n\nWe see that we can define easily a one-to-one correspondence, written \u223c, between all the elements of the\nref\nsuper-power set S \u0398 and the elements of the power set 2\u0398 as follows:\n\u2205 \u223c \u2205,\n\n(\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 ) \u223c C,\n\n\u03b81 \u223c (A \u222a C),\n\nc(\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 ) \u223c (A \u222a B),\n\n\u03b82 \u223c (B \u222a C),\nc(\u03b81 ) \u223c B,\n\n(\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) \u223c (A \u222a B \u222a C)\n\nc(\u03b82 ) \u223c A\nref\n\nSuch one-to-one correspondence between the elements of S \u0398 and 2\u0398 can be defined for any cardinality\nref\n|\u0398| \u2265 2 of the frame \u0398 and thus one can consider S \u0398 as the mathematical construction of the power set 2\u0398\nof the minimal refinement of the frame \u0398.

Working with S \u0398\nis actually very similar to working with 2\u0398 in the sense that in both cases we work with classical power sets;\nthe only difference is that when working with S \u0398 we have implicitly switched from the original frame \u0398 representation to a minimal refinement \u0398ref representation. Therefore, in the sequel we focus our discussions based\nmainly on hyper-power set rather than (super-) power set which has already been the basis for the development\nof DST. But as already mentioned, DSmT can easily deal with belief functions defined on 2\u0398 or S \u0398 similarly\nas those defined on D \u0398 .\nGeneric notation: In the sequel, we use the generic notation G\u0398 for denoting the sets (power set, hyper-power\nset and super-power set) on which the belief functions are defined.\nRemark on the logical refinement: The refinement in logic theory presented recently by Cholvy in [2] was\nactually proposed in nineties by a Guan and Bell [14] and by Paris [20]. This refinement is isomorphic to the\nrefinement in set theory done by many researchers. If \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 } is a language where the propositional\nvariables are \u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 , Cholvy considers all 8 possible logical combinations of propositions \u03b8i 's or negations\nof \u03b8i 's (called interpretations), and defines the 8 = 23 disjoint parts/propositions of the Venn diagram in Fig. 2\n[one also considers as a part the negation of the total ignorance] in the set theory, so that:\ni1 = \u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 \u2227 \u03b83\ni2 = \u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b83\ni3 = \u03b81 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b82 \u2227 \u03b83\ni4 = \u03b81 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b82 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b83\ni5 = \u00ac\u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 \u2227 \u2227\u03b83\ni6 = \u00ac\u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b83\ni7 = \u00ac\u03b81 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b82 \u2227 \u03b83\ni8 = \u00ac\u03b81 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b82 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b83\nwhere \u00ac\u03b8i means the negation of \u03b8i .\n\n\f\u0398\n\u03b81\n\n..............................................\n..........\n........\n.......\n......\n......\n......\n......\n.....\n.\n.\n.\n.\n....\n...\n.\n.\n....\n.\n..\n...\n.\n.\n...\n..\n.\n.\n...\n..\n\u03b8\n\u2227\n\u00ac\u03b8\n\u2227\n\u00ac\u03b8\n...\n.\n1\n2\n3\n...\n..\n.\n...\n....\n..\n...\n...\np1\n..\n....\n..\n..\n..\n...\n..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.... .....................................................\n.\n.\n.\n.......... ....\n........ ................\n.\n.\n.............\n.\n.\n.........\n.........\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.. ....... \u03b8 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b8 \u2227 \u03b8 .. ..........\n.. ..\n.....\n..... 1\n2\n3 ..\n...... .. \u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b83.........\n...\n... 3\n..\n..\n2......... ........\n....\n....\n...\n.\n..\n.\n...\n...\n..\n...\n..\n.\n.\n...\n.\n.\n...\n.\n.\n...\n...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n..\n...\np\np\np\n.\n.\n.\n.\n...\n12 .\n123\n13 ..\n...\n...\n..\n.\n.\n...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n...\n...\n.\n..\n....\n.\n.\n..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n...\n...\n....\n..\n.\n.\n.\n...\n..... .... \u03b8 \u2227 \u03b8 \u2227 \u03b8\n.\n....\n...\n...\n.\n...... ..\n.\n1\n2\n3\n.\n.\n..\n.\n....\n........\n.......\n..\n.\n...\n.\n.\n.\n....\n..\n........\n.\n.\n.\n.\n...\n.\n.\n.... .....................\n.\n.\n...\n.................................\n..\n..\n.\n.\n.\n..\n...\n.\n..\n.\n.\n...\n...\n..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n...\n...\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n... \u00ac\u03b8 \u2227 \u03b8 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b8\n.\n1\n2\n3 .... \u00ac\u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 \u2227 \u03b83 .... \u00ac\u03b81 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b82 \u2227 \u03b83 ....\n...\n...\n...\n..\n..\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n..\n..\np\np23\np3\n...\n...\n2\n...\n...\n.\n.\n...\n...\n.\n.\n..\n..\n...\n...\n....\n...\n....\n....\n...\n.....\n....\n.....\n.....\n...... ..........\n......\n......\n............\n......\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.......\n.......\n...... ...............\n.........\n...................................................\n...................................................\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u00ac\u03b81 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b82 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b83\n\np0\n\nFig. 2: Venn diagram of the free DSm model for a 3D frame.\nBecause of Shafer's equivalence of subsets and propositions, Cholvy's logical refinement is strictly equivalent to the refinement we did already in 2006 in defining S \u0398 - see Chap. 8 of [34] - but in the set theory\nframework. We did it using Smarandache's codification (easy to understand and read) in the following way:\n- each Venn diagram disjoint part pij , or pijk represents respectively the intersection of pi and pj only, or\npi and pj and pk only, etc; while the complement of the total ignorance is considered p0 [p stands for\npart].\nThus, we have an easier and clearer representation in DSmT than in Cholvy's logical representation. While\nthe refinement in DST using logical approach for n very large is very hard, we can simply consider in the DSmT\nthe super-power set S \u0398 = (\u0398, \u222a, \u2229, c(.)). So, in DSmT representation the disjoint parts are noted as follows:\np123 = \u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 \u2227 \u03b83 = i1\np12 = \u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b83 = i2\np13 = \u03b81 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b82 \u2227 \u03b83 = i3\np23 = \u00ac\u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 \u2227 \u03b83 = i5\np1 = \u03b81 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b82 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b83 = i4\np2 = \u00ac\u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b83 = i6\np3 = \u00ac\u03b81 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b82 \u2227 \u03b83 = i7\np0 = \u00ac\u03b81 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b82 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b83 = i8\nAs seeing, in Smarandache's codification a disjoint Venn diagram part is equal to the intersection of singletons whose indexes show up as indexes of the Venn part; for example in p12 case indexes 1 and 2, intersected\nwith the complement of the missing indexes, in this case index 3 is missing.\nSmarandache's codification can easily transform any set from S \u0398 into its canonical disjunctive normal form.\nFor example, \u03b81 = p1 \u222a p12 \u222a p13 \u222a p123 (i.e. all Venn diagram disjoint parts that contain the index \"1\" in their\nindexes ; such indexes from S \u0398 are 1, 12, 13, 123) can be expressed as\n\u03b81 = (\u03b81 \u2229 c(\u03b82 ) \u2229 c(\u03b83 )) \u222a (\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 \u2229 c(\u03b83 ))(\u03b81 \u2229 c(\u03b82 ) \u2229 \u03b83 ) \u222a (\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 \u2229 \u03b83 )\nwhere the set values of each part was taken from the above table.\n\n\f\u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 = p12 \u222a p123 (i.e. all Venn diagram disjoint parts that contain the index \"12\" in their indexes) equals\nto (\u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 \u2227 \u00ac\u03b83 ) \u2228 (\u03b81 \u2227 \u03b82 \u2227 \u03b83 ).\nThe refinement based on Venn Diagram, becomes very hard and almost impossible when the cardinal of \u0398,\nn, is large and all intersections are non-empty (the free model). Suppose n = 20, or even bigger, and we have\nthe free model. How can we construct a Venn Diagram where to show all possible intersections of 20 sets? Its\ngeometrical figure would be very hard to design and very hard to read (you don't identify well each disjoint\npart of a such Venn Diagram to what intersection of sets it belongs to). The larger is n, the more difficult is\nthe refinement. Fortunately, based on Smarandache's codification, we can algebraically design in an easy way\nfor all such intersections (for example, if n is very big, we can use computer programs to make combinations\nof indexes {1, 2, ..., n} taken in groups or 1, of 2, ..., or of n elements each), so the refinement should not\nbe a big problem from the programming point of view, but we must always keep in mind if such refinement\nis really necessary and if it has (or not) a deep physical interpretation and justification for the problem under\nconsideration.\nThe assertion in [2], upon Milan Daniel's, that hybrid DSm rule is equivalent to Dubois-Prade rule is untrue,\nsince in dynamic fusion they give different results. Such example has been already given in [7] and is reported\nin section 2.6.3 for the sake of clarification for the readers. The assertion in [2] that \"from an expressivity point\nof view DSmT is equivalent to DST\" is partially true since this idea is true when the refinement is possible (not\nref\nalways it is practically/physically possible), and even when the spaces we work on, S \u0398 = 2\u0398 , where the\nhypotheses are exclusive, DSmT offers the advantage that the refinement is already done (it is not necessary\nfor the user to do (or implicitly presuppose) it as in DST). Also, DSmT accepts from the very beginning the\npossibility to deal with non-exclusive hypotheses and of course it can a fortiori deal with sets of exclusive hyref\npothesis and work either on 2\u0398 or 2\u0398 whenever necessary, while DST first requires implicitly to work with\nexclusive hypotheses only.\nThe main distinctions between DSmT and DST are summarized by the following points:\n1. The refinement is not always (physically) possible, especially for elements from the frame of discernment\nwhose frontiers are not clear, such as: colors, vague sets, unclear hypotheses, etc. in the frame of\ndiscernment; DST does not fit well for working in such cases, while DSmT does;\n2. Even in the case when the frame of discernment can be refined (i.e. the atomic elements of the frame\nhave all a distinct physical meaning), it is still easier to use DSmT than DST since in DSmT framework\nthe refinement is done automatically by the mathematical construction of the super-power set;\n3. DSmT offers better fusion rules, for example Proportional Conflict redistribution Rule # 5 (PCR5) presented in the sequel - is better than Dempster's rule; hybrid DSm rule (DSmH) works for the dynamic\nfusion, while Dubois-Prade fusion rule does not (DSmH is an extension of Dubois-Prade rule);\n4. DSmT offers the best qualitative operators (when working with labels) giving the most accurate and\ncoherent results;\n5. DSmT offers new interesting quantitative conditioning rules (BCRs) and qualitative conditioning rules\n(QBCRs), different from Shafer's conditioning rule (SCR). SCR can be seen simply as a combination of\na prior mass of belief with the mass m(A) = 1 whenever A is the conditioning event;\n6. DSmT proposes a new approach for working with imprecise quantitative or qualitative information and\nnot limited to interval-valued belief structures as proposed generally in the literature [5, 6, 47].\n\n2.2\n\nNotion of free and hybrid DSm models\n\nFree DSm model: The elements \u03b8i , i = 1, . . . , n of \u0398 constitute the finite set of hypotheses/concepts characterizing the fusion problem under consideration. When there is no constraint on the elements of the frame, we\ncall this model the free DSm model, written Mf (\u0398). This free DSm model allows to deal directly with fuzzy\n\n\fconcepts which depict a continuous and relative intrinsic nature and which cannot be precisely refined into finer\ndisjoint information granules having an absolute interpretation because of the unreachable universal truth. In\nsuch case, the use of the hyper-power set D \u0398 (without integrity constraints) is particularly well adapted for\ndefining the belief functions one wants to combine.\nShafer's model: In some fusion problems involving discrete concepts, all the elements \u03b8i , i = 1, . . . , n of \u0398\ncan be truly exclusive. In such case, all the exclusivity constraints on \u03b8i , i = 1, . . . , n have to be included in the\nprevious model to characterize properly the true nature of the fusion problem and to fit it with the reality. By\ndoing this, the hyper-power set D \u0398 as well as the super-power set S \u0398 reduce naturally to the classical power\nset 2\u0398 and this constitutes what we have called Shafer's model, denoted M0 (\u0398). Shafer's model corresponds\nactually to the most restricted hybrid DSm model.\nHybrid DSm models: Between the class of fusion problems corresponding to the free DSm model Mf (\u0398)\nand the class of fusion problems corresponding to Shafer's model M0 (\u0398), there exists another wide class\nof hybrid fusion problems involving in \u0398 both fuzzy continuous concepts and discrete hypotheses. In such\n(hybrid) class, some exclusivity constraints and possibly some non-existential constraints (especially when\nworking on dynamic4 fusion) have to be taken into account. Each hybrid fusion problem of this class will then\nbe characterized by a proper hybrid DSm model denoted M(\u0398) with M(\u0398) 6= Mf (\u0398) and M(\u0398) 6= M0 (\u0398).\nIn any fusion problems, we consider as primordial at the very beginning and before combining information\nexpressed as belief functions to define clearly the proper frame \u0398 of the given problem and to choose explicitly\nits corresponding model one wants to work with. Once this is done, the second important point is to select\nthe proper set 2\u0398 , D \u0398 or S \u0398 on which the belief functions will be defined. The third important point will be\nthe choice of an efficient rule of combination of belief functions and finally the criteria adopted for decisionmaking.\nIn the sequel, we focus our presentation mainly on hyper-power set D \u0398 (unless specified) since it the most\ninteresting new aspect of DSmT for readers already familiar with DST framework, but a fortiori we can work\nref\nsimilarly on classical power set 2\u0398 if Shafer's model holds, and even on 2\u0398 (the power set of the minimal\nrefined frame) whenever one wants to use it and if possible.\nExamples of models for a frame \u0398:\n\u2022 Let's consider the 2D problem where \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 } with D \u0398 = {\u2205, \u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 , \u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 } and assume\nM0\n\nnow that \u03b81 and \u03b82 are truly exclusive (i.e. Shafer's model M0 holds), then because \u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 = \u2205, one gets\nM0\n\nD \u0398 = {\u2205, \u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 = \u2205, \u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 } = {\u2205, \u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 } \u2261 2\u0398 .\n\u2022 As another simple example of hybrid DSm model, let's consider the 3D case with the frame \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 }\nwith the model M =\n6 Mf in which we force all possible conjunctions to be empty, but \u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 . This hybrid\nDSm model is then represented with the Venn diagram on Fig. 3 (where boundaries of intersection of \u03b81 and \u03b82\nare not precisely defined if \u03b81 and \u03b82 represent only fuzzy concepts like smallness and tallness by example).\n\n2.3\n\nGeneralized belief functions\n\nFrom a general frame \u0398, we define a map m(.) : G\u0398 \u2192 [0, 1] associated to a given body of evidence B as\nX\nm(\u2205) = 0\nand\nm(A) = 1\n(2)\nA\u2208G\u0398\n\nThe quantity m(A) is called the generalized basic belief assignment/mass (gbba) of A.\n4\n\ni.e. when the frame \u0398 and/or the model M is changing with time.\n\n\f\u03b81 \u272c\u2729\n\u03b82\n\u272c\u2729\n\u2758\n\u2745\n\n\u2720\n\n1\n\n12\n\n2\n\n\u272b\u272a\n\u272b\u272a\n\u272c\u2729\n3\n\n\u271b \u03b83\n\n\u272b\u272a\n\nFig. 3: Venn diagram of a DSm hybrid model for a 3D frame.\nThe generalized belief and plausibility functions are defined in almost the same manner as within DST, i.e.\nX\nX\nm(B)\nPl(A) =\nBel(A) =\nm(B)\n(3)\nB\u2286A\nB\u2208G\u0398\n\nB\u2229A6=\u2205\nB\u2208G\u0398\n\nWe recall that G\u0398 is the generic notation for the set on which the gbba is defined (G\u0398 can be 2\u0398 , D \u0398\nor even S \u0398 depending on the model chosen for \u0398). These definitions are compatible with the definitions of\nthe classical belief functions in DST framework when G\u0398 = 2\u0398 for fusion problems where Shafer's model\nM0 (\u0398) holds. We still have \u2200A \u2208 G\u0398 , Bel(A) \u2264 Pl(A). Note that when working with the free DSm model\nMf (\u0398), one has always Pl(A) = 1 \u2200A 6= \u2205 \u2208 (G\u0398 = D \u0398 ) which is normal.\nExample: Let's consider the simple frame \u0398 = {A, B}, then depending on the model we choose for G\u0398 , one\nwill consider either:\n\u2022 G\u0398 as the power set 2\u0398 and therefore:\nm(A) + m(B) + m(A \u222a B) = 1\n\u2022 G\u0398 as the hyper-power set D \u0398 and therefore:\nm(A) + m(B) + m(A \u222a B) + m(A \u2229 B) = 1\n\u2022 G\u0398 as the super-power set S \u0398 and therefore:\nm(A) + m(B) + m(A \u222a B) + m(A \u2229 B) + m(c(A)) + m(c(B)) + m(c(A) \u222a c(B)) = 1\n\n2.4\n\nThe classic DSm rule of combination\n\nWhen the free DSm model Mf (\u0398) holds for the fusion problem under consideration, the classic DSm rule of\ncombination mMf (\u0398) \u2261 m(.) , [m1 \u2295 m2 ](.) of two independent5 sources of evidences B1 and B2 over the\nsame frame \u0398 with belief functions Bel1 (.) and Bel2 (.) associated with gbba m1 (.) and m2 (.) corresponds to\nthe conjunctive consensus of the sources. It is given by [31]:\nX\n\u2200C \u2208 D \u0398 ,\nmMf (\u0398) (C) \u2261 m(C) =\nm1 (A)m2 (B)\n(4)\nA,B\u2208D \u0398\nA\u2229B=C\n\nSince D \u0398 is closed under \u222a and \u2229 set operators, this new rule of combination guarantees that m(.) is a\nproper generalized belief assignment, i.e. m(.) : D \u0398 \u2192 [0, 1]. This rule of combination is commutative and\nassociative and can always be used for the fusion of sources involving fuzzy concepts when free DSm model\nholds for the problem under consideration. This rule has been extended for s > 2 sources in [31].\n5\n\nWhile independence is a difficult concept to define in all theories managing epistemic uncertainty, we follow here the\ninterpretation of Smets in [37] and [38], p. 285 and consider that two sources of evidence are independent (i.e distinct and\nnoninteracting) if each leaves one totally ignorant about the particular value the other will take.\n\n\fAccording to Table 2, this classic DSm rule of combination looks very expensive in terms of computations\nand memory size due to the huge number of elements in D \u0398 when the cardinality of \u0398 increases. This remark\nis however valid only if the cores (the set of focal elements of gbba) K1 (m1 ) and K2 (m2 ) coincide with D \u0398 ,\ni.e. when m1 (A) > 0 and m2 (A) > 0 for all A 6= \u2205 \u2208 D \u0398 . Fortunately, it is important to note here that in\nmost of the practical applications the sizes of K1 (m1 ) and K2 (m2 ) are much smaller than |D \u0398 | because bodies\nof evidence generally allocate their basic belief assignments only over a subset of the hyper-power set. This\nmakes things easier for the implementation of the classic DSm rule (4). The DSm rule is actually very easy\nto implement. It suffices for each focal element of K1 (m1 ) to multiply it with the focal elements of K2 (m2 )\nand then to pool all combinations which are equivalent under the algebra of sets. While very costly in term on\nref\nmemory storage in the worst case (i.e. when all m(A) > 0, A \u2208 D \u0398 or A \u2208 2\u0398 ), the DSm rule however\nrequires much smaller memory storage than when working with S \u0398 , i.e. working with a minimal refined frame\nsatisfying Shafer's model.\nIn most fusion applications only a small subset of elements of D \u0398 have a non null basic belief mass because all the commitments are just usually impossible to obtain precisely when the dimension of the problem\nincreases. Thus, it is not necessary to generate and keep in memory all elements of D \u0398 (or eventually S \u0398 ) but\nonly those which have a positive belief mass. However there is a real technical challenge on how to manage\nefficiently all elements of the hyper-power set. This problem is obviously much more difficult when trying to\nwork on a refined frame of discernment \u0398ref if one really prefers to use Dempster-Shafer theory and apply\nDempster's rule of combination. It is important to keep in mind that the ultimate and minimal refined frame\nconsisting in exhaustive and exclusive finite set of refined exclusive hypotheses is just impossible to justify and\nto define precisely for all problems dealing with fuzzy and ill-defined continuous concepts. A discussion on\nrefinement with an example has be included in [31].\n\n2.5\n\nThe hybrid DSm rule of combination\n\nWhen the free DSm model Mf (\u0398) does not hold due to the true nature of the fusion problem under consideration which requires to take into account some known integrity constraints, one has to work with a proper\nhybrid DSm model M(\u0398) 6= Mf (\u0398). In such case, the hybrid DSm rule (DSmH) of combination based on\nthe chosen hybrid DSm model M(\u0398) for k \u2265 2 independent sources of information is defined for all A \u2208 D \u0398\nas [31]:\nh\ni\nmDSmH (A) = mM(\u0398) (A) , \u03c6(A) S1 (A) + S2 (A) + S3 (A)\n(5)\nwhere all sets involved in formulas are in the canonical form and \u03c6(A) is the characteristic non-emptiness\nfunction of a set A, i.e. \u03c6(A) = 1 if A \u2208\n/ \u2205 and \u03c6(A) = 0 otherwise, where \u2205 , {\u2205M , \u2205}. \u2205M is the set of\nall elements of D \u0398 which have been forced to be empty through the constraints of the model M and \u2205 is the\nclassical/universal empty set. S1 (A) \u2261 mMf (\u03b8) (A), S2 (A), S3 (A) are defined by\nS1 (A) ,\n\nk\nY\n\nX\n\nmi (Xi )\n\n(6)\n\nX1 ,X2 ,...,Xk \u2208D \u0398 i=1\nX1 \u2229X2 \u2229...\u2229Xk =A\n\nS2 (A) ,\n\nk\nY\n\nX\n\nmi (Xi )\n\n(7)\n\ni=1\nX1 ,X2 ,...,Xk \u2208\u2205\n[U =A]\u2228[(U \u2208\u2205)\u2227(A=It )]\n\nS3 (A) ,\n\nX\n\nk\nY\n\nmi (Xi )\n\n(8)\n\ni=1\nX1 ,X2 ,...,Xk\nX1 \u222aX2 \u222a...\u222aXk =A\nX1 \u2229X2 \u2229...\u2229Xk \u2208\u2205\n\u2208D \u0398\n\nwith U , u(X1 )\u222au(X2 )\u222a. . .\u222au(Xk ) where u(X) is the union of all \u03b8i that compose X, It , \u03b81 \u222a\u03b82 \u222a. . .\u222a\u03b8n\nis the total ignorance. S1 (A) corresponds to the classic DSm rule for k independent sources based on the free\nDSm model Mf (\u0398); S2 (A) represents the mass of all relatively and absolutely empty sets which is transferred\n\n\fto the total or relative ignorances associated with non existential constraints (if any, like in some dynamic\nproblems); S3 (A) transfers the sum of relatively empty sets directly onto the canonical disjunctive form of\nnon-empty sets.\nThe hybrid DSm rule of combination generalizes the classic DSm rule of combination and is not equivalent\nto Dempter's rule. It works for any models (the free DSm model, Shafer's model or any other hybrid models)\nwhen manipulating precise generalized (or eventually classical) basic belief functions. An extension of this\nrule for the combination of imprecise generalized (or eventually classical) basic belief functions is presented\nin next section. As already stated, in DSmT framework it is also possible to deal directly with complements\nif necessary depending on the problem under consideration and the information provided by the sources of\nevidence themselves.\nThe first and simplest way is to work with S \u0398 on Shafer's model when a minimal refinement is possible and\nmakes sense. The second way is to deal with partially known frame and introduce directly the complementary\nhypotheses into the frame itself. By example, if one knows only two hypotheses \u03b81 , \u03b82 and their complements\n\u03b8\u03041 , \u03b8\u03042 , then we can choose switch from original frame \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 } to the new frame \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b8\u03041 , \u03b8\u03042 }. In\nsuch case, we don't necessarily assume that \u03b8\u03041 = \u03b82 and \u03b8\u03042 = \u03b81 because \u03b8\u03041 and \u03b8\u03042 may include other unknown\nhypotheses we have no information about (case of partial known frame). More generally, in DSmT framework,\nit is not necessary that the frame is built on pure/simple (possibly vague) hypotheses \u03b8i as usually done in\nall theories managing uncertainty. The frame \u0398 can also contain directly as elements conjunctions and/or\ndisjunctions (or mixed propositions) and negations/complements of pure hypotheses as well. The DSm rules\nalso work in such non-classic frames because DSmT works on any distributive lattice built from \u0398 anywhere\n\u0398 is defined.\n\n2.6\n\nExamples of combination rules\n\nHere are some numerical examples on results obtained by DSm rules of combination. More examples can be\nfound in [31].\n2.6.1\n\nExample with \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 , \u03b84 }\n\nLet's consider the frame of discernment \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 , \u03b84 }, two independent experts, and the two following\nbbas\nm1 (\u03b81 ) = 0.6 m1 (\u03b83 ) = 0.4 m2 (\u03b82 ) = 0.2 m2 (\u03b84 ) = 0.8\nrepresented in terms of mass matrix\n\n\u0014\n\n0.6 0 0.4 0\nM=\n0 0.2 0 0.8\n\n\u0015\n\n\u2022 Dempster's rule cannot be applied because: \u22001 \u2264 j \u2264 4, one gets m(\u03b8j ) = 0/0 (undefined!).\n\u2022 But the classic DSm rule works because one obtains: m(\u03b81 ) = m(\u03b82 ) = m(\u03b83 ) = m(\u03b84 ) = 0, and\nm(\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 ) = 0.12, m(\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b84 ) = 0.48, m(\u03b82 \u2229 \u03b83 ) = 0.08, m(\u03b83 \u2229 \u03b84 ) = 0.32 (partial paradoxes/conflicts).\n\u2022 Suppose now one finds out that all intersections are empty (Shafer's model), then one applies the hybrid\nDSm rule and one gets (index h stands here for hybrid rule): mh (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = 0.12, mh (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b84 ) = 0.48,\nmh (\u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 ) = 0.08 and mh (\u03b83 \u222a \u03b84 ) = 0.32.\n2.6.2\n\nGeneralization of Zadeh's example with \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 }\n\nLet's consider 0 < \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 < 1 be two very tiny positive numbers (close to zero), the frame of discernment be\n\u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 }, have two experts (independent sources of evidence s1 and s2 ) giving the belief masses\nm1 (\u03b81 ) = 1 \u2212 \u01eb1\nm2 (\u03b81 ) = 0\n\nm1 (\u03b82 ) = 0 m1 (\u03b83 ) = \u01eb1\n\nm2 (\u03b82 ) = 1 \u2212 \u01eb2\n\nm2 (\u03b83 ) = \u01eb2\n\n\fFrom now on, we prefer to use matrices to describe the masses, i.e.\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 \u2212 \u01eb1\n0\n\u01eb1\n0\n1 \u2212 \u01eb2 \u01eb2\n\u2022 Using Dempster's rule of combination, one gets\nm(\u03b83 ) =\n\n(\u01eb1 \u01eb2 )\n=1\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb1 ) * 0 + 0 * (1 \u2212 \u01eb2 ) + \u01eb1 \u01eb2\n\nwhich is absurd (or at least counter-intuitive). Note that whatever positive values for \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 are, Dempster's rule of combination provides always the same result (one) which is abnormal. The only acceptable\nand correct result obtained by Dempster's rule is really obtained only in the trivial case when \u01eb1 = \u01eb2 = 1,\ni.e. when both sources agree in \u03b83 with certainty which is obvious.\n\u2022 Using the DSm rule of combination based on free-DSm model, one gets m(\u03b83 ) = \u01eb1 \u01eb2 , m(\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 ) =\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )(1 \u2212 \u01eb2 ), m(\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b83 ) = (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )\u01eb2 , m(\u03b82 \u2229 \u03b83 ) = (1 \u2212 \u01eb2 )\u01eb1 and the others are zero which appears\nmore reliable/trustable.\n\u2022 Going back to Shafer's model and using the hybrid DSm rule of combination, one gets m(\u03b83 ) = \u01eb1 \u01eb2 ,\nm(\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )(1 \u2212 \u01eb2 ), m(\u03b81 \u222a \u03b83 ) = (1 \u2212 \u01eb1 )\u01eb2 , m(\u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 ) = (1 \u2212 \u01eb2 )\u01eb1 and the others are\nzero.\nNote that in the special case when \u01eb1 = \u01eb2 = 1/2, one has\nm1 (\u03b81 ) = 1/2\n\nm1 (\u03b82 ) = 0\n\nm1 (\u03b83 ) = 1/2\n\nm2 (\u03b81 ) = 0 m2 (\u03b82 ) = 1/2\n\nm2 (\u03b83 ) = 1/2\n\nDempster's rule of combinations still yields m(\u03b83 ) = 1 while the hybrid DSm rule based on the same Shafer's\nmodel yields now m(\u03b83 ) = 1/4, m(\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = 1/4, m(\u03b81 \u222a \u03b83 ) = 1/4, m(\u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 ) = 1/4 which is normal.\n2.6.3\n\nComparison with Smets, Yager and Dubois & Prade rules\n\nWe compare the results provided by DSmT rules and the main common rules of combination on the following very simple numerical example where only 2 independent sources (a priori assumed equally reliable) are\ninvolved and providing their belief initially on the 3D frame \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 }. It is assumed in this example\nthat Shafer's model holds and thus the belief assignments m1 (.) and m2 (.) do not commit belief to internal\nconflicting information. m1 (.) and m2 (.) are chosen as follows:\nm1 (\u03b81 ) = 0.1\n\nm1 (\u03b82 ) = 0.4\n\nm1 (\u03b83 ) = 0.2\n\nm1 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = 0.3\n\nm2 (\u03b81 ) = 0.5\n\nm2 (\u03b82 ) = 0.1\n\nm2 (\u03b83 ) = 0.3\n\nm2 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = 0.1\n\nThese belief masses are usually represented in the form of a belief mass matrix M given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n0.1 0.4 0.2 0.3\nM=\n0.5 0.1 0.3 0.1\n\n(9)\n\nwhere index i for the rows corresponds to the index of the source no. i and the indexes j for columns of M\ncorrespond to a given choice for enumerating the focal elements of all sources. In this particular example, index j = 1 corresponds to \u03b81 , j = 2 corresponds to \u03b82 , j = 3 corresponds to \u03b83 and j = 4 corresponds to \u03b81 \u222a\u03b82 .\nNow let's imagine that one finds out that \u03b83 is actually truly empty because some extra and certain knowledge on \u03b83 is received by the fusion center. As example, \u03b81 , \u03b82 and \u03b83 may correspond to three suspects\n(potential murders) in a police investigation, m1 (.) and m2 (.) corresponds to two reports of independent witnesses, but it turns out that finally \u03b83 has provided a strong alibi to the criminal police investigator once arrested\n\n\fM\n\nby the policemen. This situation corresponds to set up a hybrid model M with the constraint \u03b83 = \u2205.\nLet's examine the result of the fusion in such situation obtained by the Smets', Yager's, Dubois & Prade's\nand hybrid DSm rules of combinations. First note that, based on the free DSm model, one would get by\napplying the classic DSm rule (denoted here by index DSmC) the following fusion result\nmDSmC (\u03b81 ) = 0.21\n\nmDSmC (\u03b82 ) = 0.11\n\nmDSmC (\u03b83 ) = 0.06\n\nmDSmC (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = 0.03\n\nmDSmC (\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 ) = 0.21\n\nmDSmC (\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b83 ) = 0.13\n\nmDSmC (\u03b82 \u2229 \u03b83 ) = 0.14\n\nmDSmC (\u03b83 \u2229 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 )) = 0.11\n\nBut because of the exclusivity constraints (imposed here by the use of Shafer's model and by the nonM\nexistential constraint \u03b83 = \u2205), the total conflicting mass is actually given by k12 = 0.06 + 0.21 + 0.13 + 0.14 +\n0.11 = 0.65.\n\u2022 If one applies Dempster's rule [24] (denoted here by index DS), one gets:\nmDS (\u2205) = 0\nmDS (\u03b81 ) = 0.21/[1 \u2212 k12 ] = 0.21/[1 \u2212 0.65] = 0.21/0.35 = 0.600000\nmDS (\u03b82 ) = 0.11/[1 \u2212 k12 ] = 0.11/[1 \u2212 0.65] = 0.11/0.35 = 0.314286\nmDS (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = 0.03/[1 \u2212 k12 ] = 0.03/[1 \u2212 0.65] = 0.03/0.35 = 0.085714\n\u2022 If one applies Smets' rule [39,40] (i.e. the non normalized version of Dempster's rule with the conflicting\nmass transferred onto the empty set), one gets:\nmS (\u2205) = m(\u2205) = 0.65\n\n(conflicting mass)\n\nmS (\u03b81 ) = 0.21\nmS (\u03b82 ) = 0.11\nmS (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = 0.03\n\u2022 If one applies Yager's rule [48\u201350], one gets:\nmY (\u2205) = 0\nmY (\u03b81 ) = 0.21\nmY (\u03b82 ) = 0.11\nmY (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = 0.03 + k12 = 0.03 + 0.65 = 0.68\nM\n\n\u2022 If one applies Dubois & Prade's rule [12], one gets because \u03b83 = \u2205 :\nmDP (\u2205) = 0\n\n(by definition of Dubois & Prade's rule)\n\nmDP (\u03b81 ) = [m1 (\u03b81 )m2 (\u03b81 ) + m1 (\u03b81 )m2 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 )\n+ m2 (\u03b81 )m1 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 )]\n+ [m1 (\u03b81 )m2 (\u03b83 ) + m2 (\u03b81 )m1 (\u03b83 )]\n= [0.1 * 0.5 + 0.1 * 0.1 + 0.5 * 0.3] + [0.1 * 0.3 + 0.5 * 0.2]\n= 0.21 + 0.13 = 0.34\nmDP (\u03b82 ) = [0.4 * 0.1 + 0.4 * 0.1 + 0.1 * 0.3] + [0.4 * 0.3 + 0.1 * 0.2]\n= 0.11 + 0.14 = 0.25\n\n\fmDP (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = [m1 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 )m2 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 )]\n+ [m1 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 )m2 (\u03b83 ) + m2 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 )m1 (\u03b83 )]\n+ [m1 (\u03b81 )m2 (\u03b82 ) + m2 (\u03b81 )m1 (\u03b82 )]\n= [0.30.1] + [0.3 * 0.3 + 0.1 * 0.2] + [0.1 * 0.1 + 0.5 * 0.4]\n= [0.03] + [0.09 + 0.02] + [0.01 + 0.20]\n= 0.03 + 0.11 + 0.21 = 0.35\nNow if one adds up the masses, one gets 0 + 0.34 + 0.25 + 0.35 = 0.94 which is less than 1. Therefore\nDubois & Prade's rule of combination does not work when a singleton, or an union of singletons, becomes\nempty (in a dynamic fusion problem). The products of such empty-element columns of the mass matrix\nM are lost; this problem is fixed in DSmT by the sum S2 (.) in (5) which transfers these products to the\ntotal or partial ignorances.\nM\n\n\u2022 Finally, if one applies DSmH rule, one gets because \u03b83 = \u2205 :\nmDSmH (\u2205) = 0\n\n(by definition of DSmH)\n\nmDSmH (\u03b81 ) = 0.34\n\n(same as mDP (\u03b81 ))\n\nmDSmH (\u03b82 ) = 0.25\n\n(same as mDP (\u03b82 ))\n\nmDSmH (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = [m1 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 )m2 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 )]\n+ [m1 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 )m2 (\u03b83 ) + m2 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 )m1 (\u03b83 )]\n+ [m1 (\u03b81 )m2 (\u03b82 ) + m2 (\u03b81 )m1 (\u03b82 )] + [m1 (\u03b83 )m2 (\u03b83 )]\n= 0.03 + 0.11 + 0.21 + 0.06 = 0.35 + 0.06 = 0.41\n6= mDP (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 )\nWe can easily verify that mDSmH (\u03b81 ) + mDSmH (\u03b82 ) + mDSmH (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = 1. In this example, using\nthe hybrid DSm rule, one transfers the product of the empty-element \u03b83 column, m1 (\u03b83 )m2 (\u03b83 ) = 0.2 *\n0.3 = 0.06, to mDSmH (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ), which becomes equal to 0.35 + 0.06 = 0.41. Clearly, DSmH rule\ndoesn't provide the same result as Dubois and Prade's rule, but only when working on static frames of\ndiscernment (restricted cases).\n\n2.7\n\nFusion of imprecise beliefs\n\nIn many fusion problems, it seems very difficult (if not impossible) to have precise sources of evidence generating precise basic belief assignments (especially when belief functions are provided by human experts), and\na more flexible plausible and paradoxical theory supporting imprecise information becomes necessary. In the\nprevious sections, we presented the fusion of precise uncertain and conflicting/paradoxical generalized basic\nbelief assignments (gbba) in DSmT framework. We mean here by precise gbba, basic belief functions/masses\nm(.) defined precisely on the hyper-power set D \u0398 where eachPmass m(X), where X belongs to D \u0398 , is represented by only one real number belonging to [0, 1] such that X\u2208D\u0398 m(X) = 1. In this section, we present\nthe DSm fusion rule for dealing with admissible imprecise generalized basic belief assignments mI (.) defined\nas real subunitary intervals of [0, 1], or even more general as real subunitary sets [i.e. sets, not necessarily\nintervals].\nAn imprecise belief assignment mI (.) over D \u0398 is said admissible\nif and only if there exists for every\nP\nX \u2208 D \u0398 at least one real number m(X) \u2208 mI (X) such that X\u2208D\u0398 m(X) = 1. The idea to work with\nimprecise belief structures represented by real subset intervals of [0, 1] is not new and has been investigated\nin [5, 6, 16] and references therein. The proposed works available in the literature, upon our knowledge were\nlimited only to sub-unitary interval combination in the framework of Transferable Belief Model (TBM) developed by Smets [39, 40]. We extend the approach of Lamata & Moral and Denoeux based on subunitary\ninterval-valued masses to subunitary set-valued masses; therefore the closed intervals used by Denoeux to denote imprecise masses are generalized to any sets included in [0,1], i.e. in our case these sets can be unions\n\n\fof (closed, open, or half-open/half-closed) intervals and/or scalars all in [0, 1]. Here, the proposed extension\nis done in the context of DSmT framework, although it can also apply directly to fusion of imprecise belief\nstructures within TBM as well if the user prefers to adopt TBM rather than DSmT.\nBefore presenting the general formula for the combination of generalized imprecise belief structures, we\nremind the following set operators involved in the DSm fusion formulas. Several numerical examples are given\nin the chapter 6 of [31].\n\u2022 Addition of sets\nS1 \u229e S2 = S2 \u229e S1 , {x | x = s1 + s2 , s1 \u2208 S1 , s2 \u2208 S2 }\n\u2022 Subtraction of sets\nS1 \u229f S2 , {x | x = s1 \u2212 s2 , s1 \u2208 S1 , s2 \u2208 S2 }\n\u2022 Multiplication of sets\nS1 \u001a S2 , {x | x = s1 * s2 , s1 \u2208 S1 , s2 \u2208 S2 }\n\u2022 Division of sets: If 0 doesn't belong to S2 ,\nS1 \u001b S2 , {x | x = s1 /s2 , s1 \u2208 S1 , s2 \u2208 S2 }\n2.7.1\n\nDSm rule of combination for imprecise beliefs\n\nWe present the generalization of the DSm rules to combine any type of imprecise belief assignment which may\nbe represented by the union of several sub-unitary (half-) open intervals, (half-)closed intervals and/or sets of\npoints belonging to [0,1]. Several numerical examples are also given. In the sequel, one uses the notation (a, b)\nfor an open interval, [a, b] for a closed interval, and (a, b] or [a, b) for a half open and half closed interval. From\nthe previous operators on sets, one can generalize the DSm rules (classic and hybrid) from scalars to sets in the\nfollowing way [31] (chap. 6): \u2200A 6= \u2205 \u2208 D \u0398 ,\nX\nY\nmIi (Xi )\n(10)\nmI (A) =\nX1 ,X2 ,...,Xk \u2208D \u0398 i=1,...,k\n(X1 \u2229X2 \u2229...\u2229Xk )=A\n\nwhere\n\nX\n\nand\n\nY\n\nrepresent the summation, and respectively product, of sets.\n\nSimilarly, one can generalize the hybrid DSm rule from scalars to sets in the following way:\nh\ni\nmIDSmH (A) = mIM(\u0398) (A) , \u03c6(A) \u001a S1I (A) \u229e S2I (A) \u229e S3I (A)\n\n(11)\n\nwhere all sets involved in formulas are in the canonical form and \u03c6(A) is the characteristic non emptiness\nfunction of the set A and S1I (A), S2I (A) and S3I (A) are defined by\nX\nY\nS1I (A) ,\nmIi (Xi )\n(12)\nX1 ,X2 ,...,Xk \u2208D \u0398 i=1,...,k\nX1 \u2229X2 \u2229...\u2229Xk =A\n\nS2I (A) ,\n\nX\n\nY\n\nmIi (Xi )\n\n(13)\n\nX1 ,X2 ,...,Xk \u2208\u2205 i=1,...,k\n[U =A]\u2228[(U \u2208\u2205)\u2227(A=It )]\n\nS3I (A) ,\n\nX\n\nX1 ,X2 ,...,Xk\n\nY\n\nmIi (Xi )\n\n(14)\n\n\u2208D \u0398 i=1,...,k\n\nX1 \u222aX2 \u222a...\u222aXk =A\nX1 \u2229X2 \u2229...\u2229Xk \u2208\u2205\n\nIn the case when all sets are reduced to points (numbers), the set operations become normal operations with\nnumbers; the sets operations are generalizations of numerical operations. When imprecise belief structures reduce to precise belief structure, DSm rules (10) and (11) reduce to their precise version (4) and (5) respectively.\n\n\f2.7.2\n\nExample\n\nHere is a simple example of fusion with multiple-interval masses. For simplicity, this example is a particular\ncase when the theorem of admissibility (see [31] p. 138 for details) is verified by a few points, which happen to\nbe just on the bounders. It is an extreme example, because we tried to comprise all kinds of possibilities which\nmay occur in the imprecise or very imprecise fusion. So, let's consider a fusion problem over \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 },\ntwo independent sources of information with the following imprecise admissible belief assignments\nA \u2208 D\u0398\nmI1 (A)\nmI2 (A)\n\u03b81\n[0.1, 0.2] \u222a {0.3}\n[0.4, 0.5]\n\u03b82\n(0.4, 0.6) \u222a [0.7, 0.8] [0, 0.4] \u222a {0.5, 0.6}\nTable 3: Inputs of the fusion with imprecise bba's.\nUsing the DSm classic (DSmC) rule for sets, one gets\nmI (\u03b81 ) = ([0.1, 0.2] \u222a {0.3}) \u001a [0.4, 0.5]\n= ([0.1, 0.2] \u001a [0.4, 0.5]) \u222a ({0.3} \u001a [0.4, 0.5])\n= [0.04, 0.10] \u222a [0.12, 0.15]\nmI (\u03b82 ) = ((0.4, 0.6) \u222a [0.7, 0.8]) \u001a ([0, 0.4] \u222a {0.5, 0.6})\n= ((0.4, 0.6) \u001a [0, 0.4]) \u222a ((0.4, 0.6) \u001a {0.5, 0.6})\n\u222a ([0.7, 0.8] \u001a [0, 0.4]) \u222a ([0.7, 0.8] \u001a {0.5, 0.6})\n= (0, 0.24) \u222a (0.20, 0.30) \u222a (0.24, 0.36) \u222a [0, 0.32]\n\u222a [0.35, 0.40] \u222a [0.42, 0.48] = [0, 0.40] \u222a [0.42, 0.48]\nmI (\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 ) = [([0.1, 0.2] \u222a {0.3}) \u001a ([0, 0.4] \u222a {0.5, 0.6})] \u229e [[0.4, 0.5]\n\u001a ((0.4, 0.6) \u222a [0.7, 0.8])]\n= [([0.1, 0.2] \u001a [0, 0.4]) \u222a ([0.1, 0.2] \u001a {0.5, 0.6})\n\u222a ({0.3} \u001a [0, 0.4]) \u222a ({0.3} \u001a {0.5, 0.6})]\n\u229e [([0.4, 0.5] \u001a (0.4, 0.6)) \u222a ([0.4, 0.5] \u001a [0.7, 0.8])]\n= [[0, 0.08] \u222a [0.05, 0.10] \u222a [0.06, 0.12] \u222a [0, 0.12]\n\u222a {0.15, 0.18}] \u229e [(0.16, 0.30) \u222a [0.28, 0.40]]\n= [[0, 0.12] \u222a {0.15, 0.18}] \u229e (0.16, 0.40]\n= (0.16, 0.52] \u222a (0.31, 0.55] \u222a (0.34, 0.58] = (0.16, 0.58]\nHence finally the fusion admissible result with DSmC rule is given by:\nA \u2208 D \u0398 mI (A) = [mI1 \u2295 mI2 ](A)\n\u03b81\n[0.04, 0.10] \u222a [0.12, 0.15]\n\u03b82\n[0, 0.40] \u222a [0.42, 0.48]\n\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82\n(0.16, 0.58]\n\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82\n0\nTable 4: Fusion result with the DSmC rule.\nM\n\nIf one finds out6 that \u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 \u2261 \u2205 (this is our hybrid model M one wants to deal with), then one uses the hybrid\nDSm rule for sets (11): mIM (\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 ) = 0 and mIM (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = (0.16, 0.58], the others imprecise masses are\nnot changed.\n6\n\nWe consider now a dynamic fusion problem.\n\n\fWith the hybrid DSm rule (DSmH) applied to imprecise beliefs, one gets now the results given in Table 5.\nA \u2208 D\u0398\n\u03b81\n\u03b82\n\nmIM (A) = [mI1 \u2295 mI2 ](A)\n[0.04, 0.10] \u222a [0.12, 0.15]\n[0, 0.40] \u222a [0.42, 0.48]\n\nM\n\n\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 \u2261 \u2205\n\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82\n\n0\n(0.16, 0.58]\n\nTable 5: Fusion result with DSmH rule for M.\nLet's check now the admissibility condition. For the source 1, there exist the precise masses (m1 (\u03b81 ) =\n0.3) \u2208 ([0.1, 0.2]\u222a{0.3}) and (m1 (\u03b82 ) = 0.7) \u2208 ((0.4, 0.6)\u222a[0.7, 0.8]) such that 0.3+0.7 = 1. For the source\n2, there exist the precise masses (m1 (\u03b81 ) = 0.4) \u2208 ([0.4, 0.5]) and (m2 (\u03b82 ) = 0.6) \u2208 ([0, 0.4] \u222a {0.5, 0.6})\nsuch that 0.4 + 0.6 = 1. Therefore both sources associated with mI1 (.) and mI2 (.) are admissible imprecise\nsources of information. It can be verified that DSmC fusion of m1 (.) and m2 (.) yields the paradoxical bba\nm(\u03b81 ) = [m1 \u2295m2 ](\u03b81 ) = 0.12, m(\u03b82 ) = [m1 \u2295m2 ](\u03b82 ) = 0.42 and m(\u03b81 \u2229\u03b82 ) = [m1 \u2295m2 ](\u03b81 \u2229\u03b82 ) = 0.46.\nOne sees that the admissibility condition is satisfied since (m(\u03b81 ) = 0.12) \u2208 (mI (\u03b81 ) = [0.04, 0.10] \u222a\n[0.12, 0.15]), (m(\u03b82 ) = 0.42) \u2208 (mI (\u03b82 ) = [0, 0.40]\u222a[0.42, 0.48]) and (m(\u03b81 \u2229\u03b82 ) = 0.46) \u2208 (mI (\u03b81 \u2229\u03b82 ) =\n(0.16, 0.58]) such that 0.12 + 0.42 + 0.46 = 1. Similarly if one finds out that \u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 = \u2205, then one uses DSmH\nrule and one gets: m(\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 ) = 0 and m(\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = 0.46; the others remain unchanged. The admissibility\ncondition still holds, because one can pick at least one number in each subset mI (.) such that the sum of these\nnumbers is 1.\n\n3\n\nProportional Conflict Redistribution rule\n\nInstead of applying a direct transfer of partial conflicts onto partial uncertainties as with DSmH, the idea behind\nthe Proportional Conflict Redistribution (PCR) rule [33, 34] is to transfer (total or partial) conflicting masses to\nnon-empty sets involved in the conflicts proportionally with respect to the masses assigned to them by sources\nas follows:\n1. calculation the conjunctive rule of the belief masses of sources;\n2. calculation the total or partial conflicting masses;\n3. redistribution of the (total or partial) conflicting masses to the non-empty sets involved in the conflicts\nproportionally with respect to their masses assigned by the sources.\nThe way the conflicting mass is redistributed yields actually several versions of PCR rules. These PCR fusion\nrules work for any degree of conflict, for any DSm models (Shafer's model, free DSm model or any hybrid\nDSm model) and both in DST and DSmT frameworks for static or dynamical fusion situations. We present\nbelow only the most sophisticated proportional conflict redistribution rule denoted PCR5 in [33, 34]. PCR5\nrule is what we feel the most efficient PCR fusion rule developed so far. This rule redistributes the partial\nconflicting mass to the elements involved in the partial conflict, considering the conjunctive normal form of\nthe partial conflict. PCR5 is what we think the most mathematically exact redistribution of conflicting mass to\nnon-empty sets following the logic of the conjunctive rule. It does a better redistribution of the conflicting mass\nthan Dempster's rule since PCR5 goes backwards on the tracks of the conjunctive rule and redistributes the\nconflicting mass only to the sets involved in the conflict and proportionally to their masses put in the conflict.\nPCR5 rule is quasi-associative and preserves the neutral impact of the vacuous belief assignment because in\nany partial conflict, as well in the total conflict (which is a sum of all partial conflicts), the conjunctive normal\nform of each partial conflict does not include \u0398 since \u0398 is a neutral element for intersection (conflict), therefore\n\u0398 gets no mass after the redistribution of the conflicting mass. We have proved in [34] the continuity property\nof the fusion result with continuous variations of bba's to combine.\n\n\f3.1\n\nPCR formulas\n\nThe PCR5 formula for the combination of two sources (s = 2) is given by: mP CR5 (\u2205) = 0 and \u2200X \u2208 G\u0398 \\{\u2205}\nmP CR5 (X) = m12 (X) +\nY\n\nX\n\n[\n\n\u2208G\u0398 \\{X}\n\nm2 (X)2 m1 (Y )\nm1 (X)2 m2 (Y )\n+\n]\nm1 (X) + m2 (Y ) m2 (X) + m1 (Y )\n\n(15)\n\nX\u2229Y =\u2205\n\nwhere all sets involved in formulas are in canonical form and where G\u0398 corresponds to classical power set 2\u0398 if\nShafer's model is used, or to a constrained hyper-power set D \u0398 if any other hybrid DSm model is used instead,\nor to the super-power set S \u0398 if the minimal refinement \u0398ref of \u0398 is used; m12 (X) \u2261 m\u2229 (X) corresponds to\nthe conjunctive consensus on X between the s = 2 sources and where all denominators are different from zero.\nIf a denominator is zero, that fraction is discarded.\nA general formula of PCR5 for the fusion of s > 2 sources has been proposed in [34], but a more intuitive PCR formula (denoted PCR6) which provides good results in practice has been proposed by Martin and\nOsswald in [34] (pages 69-88) and is given by: mP CR6 (\u2205) = 0 and \u2200X \u2208 G\u0398 \\ {\u2205}\n\nmP CR6 (X) = m12...s (X) +\n\ns\nX\n\nmi (X)2\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03c3i counts from 1 to s avoiding i:\n\u001a\n\ns\u22121\n\n\uf8eb\n\nX\n\n\u2229 Y\u03c3 (k) \u2229X\u2261\u2205\nk=1 i\n(Y\u03c3i (1) ,...,Y\u03c3i(s\u22121) )\u2208(G\u0398 )s\u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n\ns\u22121\nY\n\nm\u03c3i (j) (Y\u03c3i (j) )\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nj=1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\ns\u22121\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nX\n\uf8edm (X)+\n\uf8f8\nm\n(Y\n)\ni\n\u03c3i (j) \u03c3i (j)\nj=1\n\n\u03c3i (j) = j\nif j < i,\n\u03c3i (j) = j + 1 if j \u2265 i,\n\nSince Yi is a focal element of expert/source i,\n\nmi (X)+\n\ns\u22121\nX\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nm\u03c3i (j) (Y\u03c3i (j) ) 6= 0; the belief mass assignment\n\nj=1\n\nm12...s (X) \u2261 m\u2229 (X) corresponds to the conjunctive consensus on X between the s > 2 sources.

Therefore\nA and B are the only focal elements involved in the conflict. Hence according to the PCR5 hypothesis\nonly A and B deserve a part of the conflicting mass and A \u222a B do not deserve. With PCR5, one\nredistributes the conflicting mass k12 = 0.18 to A and B proportionally with the masses m1 (A) and\nm2 (B) assigned to A and B respectively.\n\n\fHere are the results obtained from Dempster's rule, DSmH and PCR5:\n\nmDS\nmDSmH\nmP CR5\n\nA\n0.512\n0.420\n0.540\n\nB\n0.146\n0.120\n0.180\n\nA\u222aB\n0.342\n0.460\n0.280\n\n\u2022 Example 2: Let's modify example 1 and consider\n\nm1 (.)\nm2 (.)\nm\u2229 (.)\n\nA\n0.6\n0.2\n0.50\n\nB\n0\n0.3\n0.12\n\nA\u222aB\n0.4\n0.5\n0.20\n\nThe conflicting mass k12 = m\u2229 (A \u2229 B) as well as the distribution coefficients for the PCR5 remains the\nsame as in the previous example but one gets now\n\nmDS\nmDSmH\nmP CR5\n\nA\n0.609\n0.500\n0.620\n\nB\n0.146\n0.120\n0.180\n\nA\u222aB\n0.231\n0.380\n0.200\n\n\u2022 Example 3: Let's modify example 2 and consider\n\nm1 (.)\nm2 (.)\nm\u2229 (.)\n\nA\n0.6\n0.2\n0.44\n\nB\n0.3\n0.3\n0.27\n\nA\u222aB\n0.1\n0.5\n0.05\n\nThe conflicting mass k12 = 0.24 = m1 (A)m2 (B) + m1 (B)m2 (A) = 0.24 is now different from\nprevious examples, which means that m2 (A) = 0.2 and m1 (B) = 0.3 did make an impact on the\nconflict. Therefore A and B are the only focal elements involved in the conflict and thus only A and B\ndeserve a part of the conflicting mass. PCR5 redistributes the partial conflicting mass 0.18 to A and B\nproportionally with the masses m1 (A) and m2 (B) and also the partial conflicting mass 0.06 to A and B\nproportionally with the masses m2 (A) and m1 (B).

Dempster's rule appears to us less exact\nthan PCR5 and Inagaki's rules [15]. It can be showed [13] that Inagaki's fusion rule (with an optimal\nchoice of tuning parameters) can become in some cases very close to PCR5 but upon our opinion PCR5\nresult is more exact (at least less ad-hoc than Inagaki's one).\n\u2022 Example 4 (A more concrete example): Three people, John (J), George (G), and David (D) are suspects to a murder. So the frame of discernment is \u0398 , {J, G, D}. Two sources m1 (.) and m2 (.)\n(witnesses) provide the following information:\n\n\fJ\n0.9\n0\n\nm1\nm2\n\nG\n0\n0.8\n\nD\n0.1\n0.2\n\nWe know that John and George are friends, but John and David hate each other, and similarly George and\nDavid.\na) Free model, i. e. all intersections are nonempty: J \u2229 G 6= \u2205, J \u2229 D 6= \u2205, G\u2229 D 6= \u2205, J \u2229 G\u2229 D 6= \u2205.\nUsing the DSm classic rule one gets:\nmDSmC\n\nJ\n0\n\nG\n0\n\nD\n0.02\n\nJ \u2229G\n0.72\n\nJ \u2229D\n0.18\n\nG\u2229D\n0.08\n\nJ \u2229G\u2229D\n0\n\nSo we can see that John and George together (J \u2229 G) are most likely to have committed the crime,\nsince the mass mDSmC (J \u2229 G) = 0.72 is the biggest resulting mass after the fusion of the two\nsources. In Shafer's model, only one suspect could commit the crime, but the free and hybrid\nmodels allow two or more people to have committed the same crime - which happens in reality.\nb) Let's consider the hybrid model, i. e. some intersections are empty, and others are not. According to\nthe above statement about the relationships between the three suspects, we can deduce that J \u2229 G 6=\n\u2205, while J \u2229 D = G \u2229 D = J \u2229 G \u2229 D = \u2205. Then we first apply the DSm Classic rule, and then\nthe transfer of the conflicting masses is done with PCR5:\nm1\nm2\nmDSmC\n\nJ\n0.9\n0\n0\n\nG\n0\n0.8\n0\n\nD\n0.1\n0.2\n0.02\n\nJ \u2229G\n\nJ \u2229D\n\nG\u2229D\n\nJ \u2229G\u2229D\n\n0.72\n\n0.18\n\n0.08\n\n0\n\nUsing PCR5 now we transfer m(J \u2229 D) = 0.18, since J \u2229 D = \u2205, to J and D proportionally with\n0.9 and 0.2 respectively, so J gets 0.15 and D gets 0.03 since:\nxJ/0.9 = z1D/0.2 = 0.18/(0.9 + 0.2) = 0.18/1.1\nwhence xJ = 0.9(0.18/1.1) = 0.15 and z1D = 0.2(0.18/1.1) = 0.03.\nAgain using PCR5, we transfer m(G \u2229 D) = 0.08, since G \u2229 D = \u2205, to G and D proportionally\nwith 0.8 and 0.1 respectively, so G gets 0.07 and D gets 0.01 since:\nyG/0.8 = z2D/0.1 = 0.08/(0.8 + 0.1) = 0.08/0.9\nwhence yG = 0.8(0.08/0.9) = 0.07 and zD = 0.1(0.08/0.9) = 0.01. Adding we get finally:\nmP CR5\n\nJ\n0.15\n\nG\n0.07\n\nD\n0.06\n\nJ \u2229G\n0.72\n\nJ \u2229D\n0\n\nG\u2229D\n0\n\nJ \u2229G\u2229D\n0\n\nSo one has a high belief that the criminals are John and George (both of them committed the crime)\nsince m(J \u2229 D) = 0.72 and it is by far the greatest fusion mass.\nIn Shafer's model, if we try to refine we get the disjoint parts: D, J \u2229 G, J \\ (J \u2229 G), and G \\ (J \u2229 G),\nbut the last two are ridiculous (what is the real/physical nature of J \\ (J \u2229 G) or G \\ (J \u2229 G) ? Half of\na person(!) ?), so the refining does not work here in reality. That's why the hybrid and free models are\nneeded.\n\u2022 Example 5 (Imprecise PCR5): The PCR5 formula can naturally work also for the combination of\nimprecise bba's. This has been already presented in section 1.11.8 page 49 of [34] with a numerical\nexample to show how to apply it. This example will therefore not be reincluded here.\n\n\f3.3\n\nZadeh's example\n\nWe compare here the solutions for well-known Zadeh's example [53, 56] provided by several fusion rules.\nA detailed presentation with more comparisons can be found in [31, 34]. Let's consider \u0398 = {M, C, T } as\nthe frame of three potential origins about possible diseases of a patient (M standing for meningitis, C for\nconcussion and T for tumor), the Shafer's model and the two following belief assignments provided by two\nindependent doctors after examination of the same patient.\nm1 (M ) = 0.9\n\nm1 (C) = 0\n\nm1 (T ) = 0.1\n\nm2 (M ) = 0\n\nm2 (C) = 0.9\n\nm2 (T ) = 0.1\n\nThe total conflicting mass is high since it is\nm1 (M )m2 (C) + m1 (M )m2 (T ) + m2 (C)m1 (T ) = 0.99\n\u2022 with Dempster's rule and Shafer's model (DS), one gets the counter-intuitive result (see justifications\nin [11, 31, 46, 50, 53]): mDS (T ) = 1\n\u2022 with Yager's rule [50] and Shafer's model: mY (M \u222a C \u222a T ) = 0.99 and mY (T ) = 0.01\n\u2022 with DSmH and Shafer's model:\nmDSmH (M \u222a C) = 0.81\n\nmDSmH (T ) = 0.01\n\nmDSmH (M \u222a T ) = mDSmH (C \u222a T ) = 0.09\n\u2022 The Dubois & Prade's rule (DP) [11] based on Shafer's model provides in Zadeh's example the same\nresult as DSmH, because DP and DSmH coincide in all static fusion problems7 .\n\u2022 with PCR5 and Shafer's model: mP CR5 (M ) = mP CR5 (C) = 0.486 and mP CR5 (T ) = 0.028.\nOne sees that when the total conflict between sources becomes high, DSmT is able (upon authors opinion) to\nmanage more adequately through DSmH or PCR5 rules the combination of information than Dempster's rule,\neven when working with Shafer's model - which is only a specific hybrid model. DSmH rule is in agreement\nwith DP rule for the static fusion, but DSmH and DP rules differ in general (for non degenerate cases) for dynamic fusion while PCR5 rule is the most exact proportional conflict redistribution rule. Besides this particular\nexample, we showed in [31] that there exist several infinite classes of counter-examples to Dempster's rule\nwhich can be solved by DSmT.\nIn summary, DST based on Dempster's rule provides counter-intuitive results in Zadeh's example, or in nonBayesian examples similar to Zadeh's and no result when the conflict is 1. Only ad-hoc discounting techniques\nallow to circumvent troubles of Dempster's rule or we need to switch to another model of representation/frame;\nin the later case the solution obtained doesn't fit with the Shafer's model one originally wanted to work with.\nWe want also to emphasize that in dynamic fusion when the conflict becomes high, both DST [24] and Smets'\nTransferable Belief Model (TBM) [39] approaches fail to respond to new information provided by new sources.\nThis can be easily showed by the very simple following example.\nExample (where TBM doesn't respond to new information):\nLet \u0398 = {A, B, C} with the (precise) bba's m1 (A) = 0.4, m1 (C) = 0.6 and m2 (A) = 0.7, m2 (B) = 0.3.\nThen one gets8 with Dempster's rule, Smets' TBM (i.e. the non-normalized version of Dempster's combina7\n\nIndeed DP rule has been developed for static fusion only while DSmH has been developed to take into account the\npossible dynamicity of the frame itself and also its associated model.\n8\nWe introduce here explicitly the indexes of sources in the fusion result since more than two sources are considered in\nthis example.\n\n\f12\n12\ntion), DSmH and PCR5: m12\nDS (A) = 1, mT BM (A) = 0.28, mT BM (\u2205) = 0.72,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f1\nm12\n\uf8f4\nDSmH (A) = 0.28\n12\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2mP CR5 (A) = 0.574725\n\uf8f2m12\n(A\n\u222a\nB)\n=\n0.12\nDSmH\nand\nm12\nP CR5 (B) = 0.111429\n12\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nm\n(A\n\u222a\nC)\n=\n0.42\n\uf8f3 12\n\uf8f4\nDSmH\n\uf8f4\nmP CR5 (C) = 0.313846\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3m12\nDSmH (B \u222a C) = 0.18\n\nNow let's consider a temporal fusion problem and introduce a third source m3 (.) with m3 (B) = 0.8 and\n12\n12\nm3 (C) = 0.2. Then one sequentially combines the results obtained by m12\nT BM (.), mDS (.), mDSmH (.) and\n(12)3\nm12\nP CR (.) with the new evidence m3 (.) and one sees that mDS becomes not defined (division by zero) and\n(12)3\nmT BM (\u2205) = 1 while (DSmH) and (PCR5) provide\n\uf8f1 (12)3\nmDSmH (B) = 0.240\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 (12)3\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2mDSmH (C) = 0.120\n(12)3\nmDSmH (A \u222a B) = 0.224\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(12)3\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nmDSmH (A \u222a C) = 0.056\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 (12)3\nmDSmH (A \u222a B \u222a C) = 0.360\n\nand\n\n\uf8f1 (12)3\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2mP CR5 (A) = 0.277490\n(12)3\nmP CR5 (B) = 0.545010\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 (12)3\nmP CR5 (C) = 0.177500\n\nWhen the mass committed to empty set becomes one at a previous temporal fusion step, then both DST\nand TBM do not respond to new information. Let's continue the example and consider a fourth source m4 (.)\n((12)3)4\n(.) is not defined\nwith m4 (A) = 0.5, m4 (B) = 0.3 and m4 (C) = 0.2. Then it is easy to see that mDS\n((12)3)4\n(12)3\nsince at previous step mDS (.) was already not defined, and that mT BM (\u2205) = 1 whatever m4 (.) is because\n(12)3\nat the previous fusion step one had mT BM (\u2205) = 1. Therefore for a number of sources n \u2265 2, DST and TBM\napproaches do not respond to new information incoming in the fusion process while both (DSmH) and (PCR5)\nrules respond to new information. To make DST and/or TBM working properly in such cases, it is necessary\nto introduce ad-hoc temporal discounting techniques which are not necessary to introduce if DSmT is adopted.\nIf there are good reasons to introduce temporal discounting, there is obviously no difficulty to apply the DSm\nfusion of these discounted sources. An analysis of this behavior for target type tracking is presented in [9, 34].\n\n4\n\nThe generalized pignistic transformation (GPT)\n\n4.1\n\nThe classical pignistic transformation\n\nWe follow here Philippe Smets' vision which considers the management of information as a two 2-levels\nprocess: credal (for combination of evidences) and pignistic9 (for decision-making) , i.e \"when someone must\ntake a decision, he/she must then construct a probability function derived from the belief function that describes\nhis/her credal state. This probability function is then used to make decisions\" [38] (p. 284). One obvious way\nto build this probability function corresponds to the so-called Classical Pignistic Transformation (CPT) defined\nin DST framework (i.e. based on the Shafer's model assumption) as [40]:\nBetP {A} =\n\nX |X \u2229 A|\nm(X)\n|X|\n\u0398\n\n(18)\n\nX\u22082\n\nwhere |A| denotes the number of worlds in the set A (with convention |\u2205|/|\u2205| = 1, to define BetP {\u2205}).\nDecisions are achieved by computing the expected utilities of the acts using the subjective/pignistic BetP {.}\nas the probability function needed to compute expectations. Usually, one uses the maximum of the pignistic\nprobability as decision criterion. The maximum of BetP {.} is often considered as a prudent betting decision\ncriterion between the two other alternatives (max of plausibility or max. of credibility which appears to be\nrespectively too optimistic or too pessimistic). It is easy to show that BetP {.} is indeed a probability function\n(see [39]).\n9\n\nPignistic terminology has been coined by Philippe Smets and comes from pignus, a bet in Latin.\n\n\f4.2\n\nNotion of DSm cardinality\n\nOne important notion involved in the definition of the Generalized Pignistic Transformation (GPT) is the DSm\ncardinality. The DSm cardinality of any element A of hyper-power set D \u0398 , denoted CM (A), corresponds to\nthe number of parts of A in the corresponding fuzzy/vague Venn diagram of the problem (model M) taking\ninto account the set of integrity constraints (if any), i.e. all the possible intersections due to the nature of the elements \u03b8i . This intrinsic cardinality depends on the model M (free, hybrid or Shafer's model). M is the model\nthat contains A, which depends both on the dimension n = |\u0398| and on the number of non-empty intersections\npresent in its associated Venn diagram (see [31] for details ). The DSm cardinality depends on the cardinal of\n\u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , . . . , \u03b8n } and on the model of D \u0398 (i.e., the number of intersections and between what elements of\n\u0398 - in a word the structure) at the same time; it is not necessarily that every singleton, say \u03b8i , has the same DSm\ncardinal, because each singleton has a different structure; if its structure is the simplest (no intersection of this\nelements with other elements) then CM (\u03b8i ) = 1, if the structure is more complicated (many intersections) then\nCM (\u03b8i ) > 1; let's consider a singleton \u03b8i : if it has 1 intersection only then CM (\u03b8i ) = 2, for 2 intersections only\nCM (\u03b8i ) is 3 or 4 depending on the model M, for m intersections it is between m + 1 and 2m depending on the\nmodel; the maximum DSm cardinality is 2n\u22121 and occurs for \u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 \u222a . . . \u222a \u03b8n in the free model Mf ; similarly\nfor any set from D \u0398 : the more complicated structure it has, the bigger is the DSm cardinal; thus the DSm\ncardinality measures the complexity of en element from D \u0398 , which is a nice characterization in our opinion;\nwe may say that for the singleton \u03b8i not even |\u0398| counts, but only its structure (= how many other singletons\nintersect \u03b8i ). Simple illustrative examples are given in Chapter 3 and 7 of [31]. One has 1 \u2264 CM (A) \u2264 2n \u2212 1.\nCM (A) must not be confused with the classical cardinality |A| of a given set A (i.e. the number of its distinct\nelements) - that's why a new notation is necessary here. CM (A) is very easy to compute by programming from\nthe algorithm of generation of D \u0398 given explicated in [31].\nExample: let's take back the example of the simple hybrid DSm model described in section 2.2, then one gets\nthe following list of elements (with their DSm cardinal) for the restricted D \u0398 taking into account the integrity\nconstraints of this hybrid model:\nA \u2208 D\u0398\nCM (A)\n\u03b10 , \u2205\n0\n\u03b11 , \u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82\n1\n\u03b12 , \u03b83\n1\n\u03b13 , \u03b81\n2\n\u03b14 , \u03b82\n2\n\u03b15 , \u03b81 \u222a \u03b82\n3\n\u03b16 , \u03b81 \u222a \u03b83\n3\n\u03b17 , \u03b82 \u222a \u03b83\n3\n\u03b18 , \u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 \u222a \u03b83\n4\nExample of DSm cardinals: CM (A) for hybrid model M.\n\n4.3\n\nThe Generalized Pignistic Transformation\n\nTo take a rational decision within DSmT framework, it is necessary to generalize the Classical Pignistic Transformation in order to construct a pignistic probability function from any generalized basic belief assignment\nm(.) drawn from the DSm rules of combination. Here is the simplest and direct extension of the CPT to define\nthe Generalized Pignistic Transformation:\n\u2200A \u2208 D \u0398 ,\n\nBetP {A} =\n\nX CM (X \u2229 A)\nm(X)\nCM (X)\n\u0398\n\n(19)\n\nX\u2208D\n\nwhere CM (X) denotes the DSm cardinal of proposition X for the DSm model M of the problem under consideration.\n\n\fThe decision about the solution of the problem is usually taken by the maximum of pignistic probability\nfunction BetP {.}. Let's remark the close ressemblance of the two pignistic transformations (18) and (19).\nIt can be shown that (19) reduces to (18) when the hyper-power set D \u0398 reduces to classical power set 2\u0398 if\nwe adopt Shafer's model. But (19) is a generalization of (18) since it can be used for computing pignistic\nprobabilities for any models (including Shafer's model). It has been proved in [31] (Chap. 7) that BetP {.}\ndefined in (19) is indeed a probability distribution. In the following section, we introduce a new alternative to\nBetP which is presented in details in [36].\n\n5\n\nThe DSmP transformation\n\nIn the theories of belief functions, the mapping from the belief to the probability domain is a controversial issue.\nThe original purpose of such mappings was to make (hard) decision, but contrariwise to erroneous widespread\nidea/claim, this is not the only interest for using such mappings nowadays. Actually the probabilistic transformations of belief mass assignments (as the pignistic transformation mentioned previously) are for example very\nuseful in modern multitarget multisensor tracking systems (or in any other systems) where one deals with soft\ndecisions (i.e. where all possible solutions are kept for state estimation with their likelihoods). For example, in\na Multiple Hypotheses Tracker using both kinematical and attribute data, one needs to compute all probabilities\nvalues for deriving the likelihoods of data association hypotheses and then mixing them altogether to estimate\nstates of targets. Therefore, it is very relevant to use a mapping which provides a high probabilistic information\ncontent (PIC) for expecting better performances.\nIn this section, we briefly recall a new probabilistic transformation, denoted DSmP and introduced in [10]\nwhich will be explained in details in [36]. DSmP is straight and different from other transformations. The\nbasic idea of DSmP consists in a new way of proportionalizations of the mass of each partial ignorance such as\nA1 \u222aA2 or A1 \u222a(A2 \u2229A3 ) or (A1 \u2229A2 )\u222a(A3 \u2229A4 ), etc. and the mass of the total ignorance A1 \u222aA2 \u222a. . .\u222aAn ,\nto the elements involved in the ignorances. This new transformation takes into account both the values of the\nmasses and the cardinality of elements in the proportional redistribution process. We first remind what PIC\ncriteria is and then shortly present the general formula for DSmP transformation with few numerical examples.\nMore examples and comparisons with respect to other transformations are given in [36].\n\n5.1\n\nThe Probabilistic Information Content (PIC)\n\nFollowing Sudano's approach [41, 42, 44], we adopt the Probabilistic Information Content (PIC) criterion as\na metric depicting the strength of a critical decision by a specific probability distribution. It is an essential\nmeasure in any threshold-driven automated decision system. The PIC is the dual of the normalized Shannon\nentropy. A PIC value of one indicates the total knowledge to make a correct decision (one hypothesis has a\nprobability value of one and the rest of zero). A PIC value of zero indicates that the knowledge to make a\ncorrect decision does not exist (all the hypotheses have an equal probability value), i.e. one has the maximal\nentropy. The PIC is used in our analysis to sort the performances of the different pignistic transformations\nthrough several numerical examples. We first recall what Shannon entropy and PIC measure are and their tight\nrelationship.\n\u2022 Shannon entropy\nShannon entropy, usually expressed in bits (binary digits), of a probability measure P {.} over a discrete\nfinite set \u0398 = {\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n } is defined by10 [25]:\nH(P ) , \u2212\n\nn\nX\n\nP {\u03b8i } log2 (P {\u03b8i })\n\n(20)\n\ni=1\n\nH(P ) is maximal for the uniform probability\nPdistribution over \u0398, i.e. when P {\u03b8i } = 1/n for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.\nIn that case, one gets H(P ) = Hmax = \u2212 ni=1 n1 log2 ( n1 ) = log2 (n). H(P ) is minimal for a totally deterministic probability, i.e. for any P {.} such that P {\u03b8i } = 1 for some i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n} and P {\u03b8j } = 0 for\nj 6= i. H(P ) measures the randomness carried by any discrete probability P {.}.\n10\n\nwith common convention 0 log2 0 = 0.\n\n\f\u2022 The PIC metric\nThe Probabilistic Information Content (PIC) of a probability measure P {.} associated with a probabilistic\nsource over a discrete finite set \u0398 = {\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n } is defined by [42]:\nP IC(P ) = 1 +\n\n1\nHmax\n\n*\n\nn\nX\n\nP {\u03b8i } log2 (P {\u03b8i })\n\n(21)\n\ni=1\n\nThe PIC is nothing but the dual of the normalized Shannon entropy and thus is actually unit less. P IC(P )\ntakes its values in [0, 1]. P IC(P ) is maximum, i.e. P ICmax = 1 with any deterministic probability and it is\nminimum, i.e. P ICmin = 0, with the uniform probability over the frame \u0398. The simple relationships between\nH(P ) and P IC(P ) are P IC(P ) = 1 \u2212 (H(P )/Hmax ) and H(P ) = Hmax * (1 \u2212 P IC(P )).\n\n5.2\n\nThe DSmP formula\n\nLet's consider a discrete frame \u0398 with a given model (free DSm model, hybrid DSm model or Shafer's model),\nthe DSmP mapping is defined by DSmP\u01eb (\u2205) = 0 and \u2200X \u2208 G\u0398 \\ {\u2205} by\nX\nm(Z) + \u01eb * C(X \u2229 Y )\nDSmP\u01eb (X) =\n\nX\n\nY\n\n\u2208G\u0398\n\nZ\u2286X\u2229Y\nC(Z)=1\n\nX\n\nm(Z) + \u01eb * C(Y )\n\nm(Y )\n\n(22)\n\nZ\u2286Y\nC(Z)=1\n\nwhere \u01eb \u2265 0 is a tuning parameter and G\u0398 corresponds to the generic set (2\u0398 , S \u0398 or D \u0398 including eventually\nall the integrity constraints (if any) of the model M); C(X \u2229 Y ) and C(Y ) denote the DSm cardinals11 of the\nsets X \u2229 Y and Y respectively. \u01eb allows to reach the maximum PIC value of the approximation of m(.) into a\nsubjective probability measure. The smaller \u01eb, the better/bigger PIC value. In some particular degenerate cases\nhowever, the DSmP\u01eb=0 values cannot be derived, but the DSmP\u01eb>0 values can however always be derived by\nchoosing \u01eb as a very small positive number, say \u01eb = 1/1000 for example in order to be as close as we want to\nthe maximum of the PIC. When \u01eb = 1 and when the masses of all elements Z having C(Z) = 1 are zero, (22)\nreduces to (19), i.e. DSmP\u01eb=1 = BetP . The passage from a free DSm model to a Shafer's model involves the\npassage from a structure to another one, and the cardinals change as well in the formula (22).\nDSmP works for all models (free, hybrid and Shafer's). In order to apply classical transformation (Pignistic, Cuzzolin's one, Sudano's ones, etc - see [36]), we need at first to refine the frame (on the cases when it\nis possible!) in order to work with Shafer's model, and then apply their formulas. In the case where refinement\nmakes sense, then one can apply the other subjective probabilities on the refined frame. DSmP works on the\nrefined frame as well and gives the same result as it does on the non-refined frame. Thus DSmP with \u01eb > 0\nworks on any models and so is very general and appealing. DSmP does a redistribution of the ignorance mass\nwith respect to both the singleton masses and the singletons' cardinals in the same time. Now, if all masses of\nsingletons involved in all ignorances are different from zero, then we can take \u01eb = 0, and DSmP gives the best\nresult, i.e. the best PIC value. In summary, DSmP does an 'improvement' over previous known probabilistic\ntransformations in the sense that DSmP mathematically makes a more accurate redistribution of the ignorance\nmasses to the singletons involved in ignorances. DSmP and BetP work in both theories: DST (= Shafer's\nmodel) and DSmT (= free or hybrid models) as well.\n\n11\n\nWe have omitted the index of the model M for the notation convenience.\n\n\f5.3\n\nExamples for DSmP and BetP\n\nThe examples briefly presented here are detailed in [36] which includes also additional results based on Cuzzolin's and Sudano's transformations.\n\u2022 With Shafer's model and a non-Bayesian mass\nLet's consider the frame \u0398 = {A, B} and let's assume Shafer's model and the non-Bayesian mass (more\nprecisely the simple support mass) given in Table 6. We summarize in Table 7, the results obtained with DSmP\nand BetP. One sees that P IC(DSmP\u01eb\u21920 ) is maximum among all PIC values.\nA\n0.4\n\nm(.)\n\nB\n0\n\nA\u222aB\n0.6\n\nTable 6: Quantitative inputs.\nA\n0.7000\n0.9985\n1\n\nBetP (.)\nDSmP\u01eb=0.001 (.)\nDSmP\u01eb=0 (.)\n\nB\n0.3000\n0.0015\n0\n\nP IC(.)\n0.1187\n0.9838\n1\n\nTable 7: Results of the probabilistic transformations.\nThe best result is an adequate probability, not the biggest PIC in this case. This is because P (B) deserves\nto receive some mass from m(A \u222a B), so the most correct result is done by DSmP\u01eb=0.001 in Table 7 (of course\nwe can choose any other very small positive value for \u01eb if we want). Always when a singleton whose mass is\nzero, but it is involved in an ignorance whose mass is not zero, then \u01eb (in DSmP formula (22)) should be taken\ndifferent from zero.\n\u2022 With a Hybrid DSm model\nLet's consider the frame \u0398 = {A, B, C} and let's consider the hybrid DSm model in which all intersections\nof elements of \u0398 are empty, but A \u2229 B corresponding to figure 4.

A simple example for qDSmP is given in the next section.\n\n6\n\nFusion of qualitative beliefs\n\nWe recall here the notion of qualitative belief assignment to model beliefs of human experts expressed in\nnatural language (with linguistic labels). We show how qualitative beliefs can be efficiently combined using an\nextension of DSmT to qualitative reasoning. A more detailed presentation can be found in [34]. The derivations\nare based on a new arithmetic on linguistic labels which allows a direct extension of all quantitative rules of\ncombination and conditioning. The qualitative version of PCR5 rule and DSmP is also presented in the sequel.\n\n6.1\n\nQualitative Operators\n\nComputing with words (CW) and qualitative information is more vague, less precise than computing with\nnumbers, but it offers the advantage of robustness if done correctly. Here is a general arithmetic we propose\nfor computing with words (i.e. with linguistic labels). Let's consider a finite frame \u0398 = {\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n } of\nn (exhaustive) elements \u03b8i , i = 1, 2, . . . , n, with an associated model M(\u0398) on \u0398 (either Shafer's model\nM0 (\u0398), free-DSm model Mf (\u0398), or more general any Hybrid-DSm model [31]). A model M(\u0398) is defined\n\n\fby the set of integrity constraints on elements of \u0398 (if any); Shafer's model M0 (\u0398) assumes all elements of\n\u0398 truly exclusive, while free-DSm model Mf (\u0398) assumes no exclusivity constraints between elements of the\nframe \u0398. Let's define a finite set of linguistic labels L\u0303 = {L1 , L2 , . . . , Lm } where m \u2265 2 is an integer. L\u0303\nis endowed with a total order relationship \u227a, so that L1 \u227a L2 \u227a . . . \u227a Lm . To work on a close linguistic\nset under linguistic addition and multiplication operators, we extends L\u0303 with two extreme values L0 and Lm+1\nwhere L0 corresponds to the minimal qualitative value and Lm+1 corresponds to the maximal qualitative value,\nin such a way that\nL0 \u227a L1 \u227a L2 \u227a . . . \u227a Lm \u227a Lm+1\nwhere \u227a means inferior to, or less (in quality) than, or smaller (in quality) than, etc. hence a relation of order\nfrom a qualitative point of view. But if we make a correspondence between qualitative labels and quantitative\nvalues on the scale [0, 1], then Lmin = L0 would correspond to the numerical value 0, while Lmax = Lm+1\nwould correspond to the numerical value 1, and each Li would belong to [0, 1], i. e.\nLmin = L0 < L1 < L2 < . . . < Lm < Lm+1 = Lmax\nFrom now on, we work on extended ordered set L of qualitative values\nL = {L0 , L\u0303, Lm+1 } = {L0 , L1 , L2 , . . . , Lm , Lm+1 }\nIn our previous works, we did propose approximate qualitative operators, but in [36] we propose to use\nbetter and accurate operators for qualitative labels. Since these new operators are defined in details in the\nchapter of [36] devoted on the DSm Field and Linear Algebra of Refined Labels (FLARL), we just briefly\nintroduce here only the the main ones (i.e. the accurate label addition, multiplication and division). In FLARL,\nwe can replace the \"qualitative quasi-normalization\" of qualitative operators we used in our previous papers by\n\"qualitative normalization\" since in FLARL we have exact qualitative calculations and exact normalization.\n\u2022 Label addition :\nsince\n\na\nm+1\n\n+\n\nb\nm+1\n\n=\n\nLa + Lb = La+b\n\n(23)\n\nLa \u00d7 Lb = L(ab)/(m+1)\n\n(24)\n\nLa \u00f7 Lb = L(a/b)(m+1)\n\n(25)\n\na+b\nm+1 .\n\n\u2022 Label multiplication :\nsince\n\na\nm+1\n\n*\n\nb\nm+1\n\n=\n\n(ab)/(m+1)\n.\nm+1\n\n\u2022 Label division (when Lb 6= L0 ):\nsince\n\na\nm+1\n\n\u00f7\n\nb\nm+1\n\n=\n\na\nb\n\n=\n\n(a/b)(m+1)\n.\nm+1\n\nMore accurate qualitative operations (substraction, scalar multiplication, scalar root, scalar power, etc) can\nbe found in [36]. Of course, if one really need to stay within the original set of labels, an approximation will be\nnecessary at the very end of the calculations.\n\n6.2\n\nQualitative Belief Assignment\n\nA qualitative belief assignment12 (qba) is a mapping function qm(.) : G\u0398 7\u2192 L where G\u0398 corresponds either\nto 2\u0398 , to D \u0398 or even to S \u0398 depending on the model of the frame \u0398 we choose to work with. In the case when\nthe labels are equidistant, i.e. the qualitative distance between any two consecutive labels is the same, we get\nan exact qualitative result, and a qualitative basic belief assignment (bba) is considered normalized if the sum\nof all its qualitative masses is equal to Lmax = Lm+1 . If the labels are not equidistant, we still can use all\nqualitative operators defined in the FLARL, but the qualitative result is approximate, and a qualitative bba is\nconsidered quasi-normalized if the sum of all its masses is equal to Lmax . Using the qualitative operator of\n12\n\nWe call it also qualitative belief mass or q-mass for short.\n\n\fFLARL, we can easily extend all the combination and conditioning rules from quantitative to qualitative. In the\nsequel we will consider s \u2265 2 qualitative belief assignments qm1 (.), . . . , qms (.) defined over the same space\nG\u0398 and provided by s independent sources S1 , . . . , Ss of evidence.\nNote: The addition and multiplication operators used in all qualitative fusion formulas in next sections correspond to qualitative addition and qualitative multiplication operators and must not be confused with classical\naddition and multiplication operators for numbers.\n\n6.3\n\nQualitative Conjunctive Rule\n\nThe qualitative Conjunctive Rule (qCR) of s \u2265 2 sources is defined similarly to the quantitative conjunctive\nconsensus rule, i.e.\nqmqCR (X) =\n\nX\n\ns\nY\n\nqmi (Xi )\n\n(26)\n\ni=1\nX1 ,...,Xs\nX1 \u2229...\u2229Xs =X\n\u2208G\u0398\n\nThe total qualitative conflicting mass is given by\nK1...s =\n\ns\nY\n\nX\n\nqmi (Xi )\n\nX1 ,...,Xs \u2208G\u0398 i=1\nX1 \u2229...\u2229Xs =\u2205\n\n6.4\n\nQualitative DSm Classic rule\n\nThe qualitative DSm Classic rule (q-DSmC) for s \u2265 2 is defined similarly to DSm Classic fusion rule (DSmC)\nas follows : qmqDSmC (\u2205) = L0 and for all X \u2208 D \u0398 \\ {\u2205},\nqmqDSmC (X) =\n\nX\n\ns\nY\n\nqmi (Xi )\n\n(27)\n\ni=1\nX1 ,,...,Xs\nX1 \u2229...\u2229Xs =X\n\n6.5\n\n\u2208D \u0398\n\nQualitative hybrid DSm rule\n\nThe qualitative hybrid DSm rule (q-DSmH) is defined similarly to quantitative hybrid DSm rule [31] as follows:\nqmqDSmH (\u2205) = L0\n\n(28)\n\nh\ni\nqmqDSmH (X) , \u03c6(X) * qS1 (X) + qS2 (X) + qS3 (X)\n\n(29)\n\nand for all X \u2208 G\u0398 \\ {\u2205}\n\nwhere all sets involved in formulas are in the canonical form and \u03c6(X) is the characteristic non-emptiness\nfunction of a set X, i.e. \u03c6(X) = Lm+1 if X \u2208\n/ \u2205 and \u03c6(X) = L0 otherwise, where \u2205 , {\u2205M , \u2205}. \u2205M is the\nset of all elements of D \u0398 which have been forced to be empty through the constraints of the model M and \u2205 is\nthe classical/universal empty set. qS1 (X) \u2261 qmqDSmC (X), qS2 (X), qS3 (X) are defined by\nqS1 (X) ,\n\nX\n\n\u2208D \u0398\n\nX1 ,X2 ,...,Xs\nX1 \u2229X2 \u2229...\u2229Xs =X\n\nqS2 (X) ,\n\nX\n\ns\nY\n\nqmi (Xi )\n\n(30)\n\ni=1\n\ns\nY\n\ni=1\nX1 ,X2 ,...,Xs \u2208\u2205\n[U =X]\u2228[(U \u2208\u2205)\u2227(X=It )]\n\nqmi (Xi )\n\n(31)\n\n\fqS3 (X) ,\n\nX\n\n\u2208D \u0398\n\nX1 ,X2 ,...,Xk\nX1 \u222aX2 \u222a...\u222aXs =X\nX1 \u2229X2 \u2229...\u2229Xs \u2208\u2205\n\ns\nY\n\nqmi (Xi )\n\n(32)\n\ni=1\n\nwith U , u(X1 ) \u222a . . . \u222a u(Xs ) where u(X) is the union of all \u03b8i that compose X, It , \u03b81 \u222a . . . \u222a \u03b8n is the total\nignorance. qS1 (X) is nothing but the qDSmC rule for s independent sources based on Mf (\u0398); qS2 (X) is the\nqualitative mass of all relatively and absolutely empty sets which is transferred to the total or relative ignorances\nassociated with non existential constraints (if any, like in some dynamic problems); qS3 (X) transfers the sum\nof relatively empty sets directly onto the canonical disjunctive form of non-empty sets. qDSmH generalizes\nqDSmC works for any models (free DSm model, Shafer's model or any hybrid models) when manipulating\nqualitative belief assignments.\n\n6.6\n\nQualitative PCR5 rule (qPCR5)\n\nIn classical (i.e. quantitative) DSmT framework, the Proportional Conflict Redistribution rule no. 5 (PCR5)\ndefined in [34] has been proven to provide very good and coherent results for combining (quantitative) belief\nmasses, see [9, 33]. When dealing with qualitative beliefs within the DSm Field and Linear Algebra of Refined\nLabels [36] we get an exact qualitative result no matter what fusion rule is used (DSm fusion rules, Dempster's\nrule, Smets's rule, Dubois-Prade's rule, etc.). The exact qualitative result will a refined label (but the user can\nround it up or down to the closest integer index label).\n\n6.7\n\nA simple example of qualitative fusion of qba's\n\nLet's consider the following set of ordered linguistic labels\nL = {L0 , L1 , L2 , L3 , L4 , L5 }\n(for example, L1 , L2 , L3 and L4 may represent the values: L1 , very poor, L2 , poor, L3 , good and\nL4 , very good, where , symbol means by definition).\nLet's consider now a simple two-source case with a 2D frame \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 }, Shafer's model for \u0398, and\nqba's expressed as follows:\nqm1 (\u03b81 ) = L1 ,\n\nqm1 (\u03b82 ) = L3 ,\n\nqm1 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = L1\n\nqm2 (\u03b81 ) = L2 ,\n\nqm2 (\u03b82 ) = L1 ,\n\nqm2 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = L2\n\nThe two qualitative masses qm1 (.) and qm2 (.) are normalized since:\nqm1 (\u03b81 ) + qm1 (\u03b82 ) + qm1 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = L1 + L3 + L1 = L1+3+1 = L5\nand\nqm2 (\u03b81 ) + qm2 (\u03b82 ) + qm2 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = L2 + L1 + L2 = L2+1+2 = L5\nWe first derive the result of the conjunctive consensus.

Since both L1 and L3 are different from L0 , we can take the tuning parameter\n\u01eb = 0 for the best transfer. \u01eb is taken different from zero when a mass of a set involved in a partial or total\nignorance is zero (for qualitative masses, it means L0 ).\nTherefore using (25), one has\nx\u03b8\nL1\nL1\nx\u03b8 1\n= 2 =\n=\n= L 1 *5 = L 5 = L1.25\n4\n4\nL1\nL3\nL1 + L3\nL4\nand thus using (24), one gets\nx\u03b81 = L1 \u00d7 L1.25 = L 1*(1.25) = L 1.25 = L0.25\n5\n\n5\n\nx\u03b82 = L3 \u00d7 L1.25 = L 3*(1.25) = L 3.75 = L0.75\n5\n\n5\n\nWhence\nqDSmP\u01eb=0 (\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 ) = qDSmP\u01eb=0 (\u2205) = L0\nqDSmP\u01eb=0 (\u03b81 ) = L1 + x\u03b81 = L1 + L0.25 = L1.25\nqDSmP\u01eb=0 (\u03b82 ) = L3 + x\u03b82 = L3 + L0.75 = L3.75\nNaturally in our example, one has also\nqDSmP\u01eb=0 (\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = qDSmP\u01eb=0 (\u03b81 ) + qDSmP\u01eb=0 (\u03b82 ) \u2212 qDSmP\u01eb=0 (\u03b81 \u2229 \u03b82 )\n= L1.25 + L3.75 \u2212 L0 = L5 = Lmax\nSince Hmax = log2 n = log2 2 = 1, using the qualitative extension of PIC formula (21), one obtains the\nfollowing qualitative PIC value:\n\nP IC = 1 +\n\n1\n* [qDSmP\u01eb=0 (\u03b81 ) log2 (qDSmP\u01eb=0 (\u03b81 ))\n1\n+ qDSmP\u01eb=0 (\u03b82 ) log2 (qDSmP\u01eb=0 (\u03b82 ))]\n\n= 1 + L1.25 log2 (L1.25 ) + L3.75 log2 (L3.75 ) \u2248 L0.94\nsince we considered the isomorphic transformation Li = i/(m + 1) (in our particular example m = 4 interior\nlabels).\n\n\f7\n7.1\n\nBelief Conditioning Rules\nShafer's Conditioning Rule (SCR)\n\nUntil very recently, the most commonly used conditioning rule for belief revision was the one proposed by\nShafer [24] and referred here as Shafer's Conditioning Rule (SCR). The SCR consists in combining the prior\nbba m(.) with a specific bba focused on A with Dempster's rule of combination for transferring the conflicting\nmass to non-empty sets in order to provide the revised bba. In other words, the conditioning by a proposition\nA, is obtained by SCR as follows :\nmSCR (.|A) = [m \u2295 mS ](.)\n\n(34)\n\nwhere m(.) is the prior bba to update, A is the conditioning event, mS (.) is the bba focused on A defined by\nmS (A) = 1 and mS (X) = 0 for all X 6= A and \u2295 denotes Dempster's rule of combination [24].\nThe SCR approach based on Dempster's rule of combination of the prior bba with the bba focused on the\nconditioning event remains subjective since actually in such belief revision process both sources are subjective\nand SCR doesn't manage properly the objective nature/absolute truth carried by the conditioning term. Indeed,\nwhen conditioning a prior mass m(.), knowing (or assuming) that the truth is in A, means that we have in\nhands an absolute (not subjective) knowledge, i.e. the truth in A has occurred (or is assumed to have occurred),\nthus A is realized (or is assumed to be realized) and this is (or at least must be interpreted as) an absolute\ntruth. The conditioning term \"Given A\" must therefore be considered as an absolute truth, while mS (A) = 1\nintroduced in SCR cannot refer to an absolute truth actually, but only to a subjective certainty on the possible\noccurrence of A from a virtual second source of evidence. The advantage of SCR remains undoubtedly in its\nsimplicity and the main argument in its favor is its coherence with conditional probability when manipulating\nBayesian belief assignment. But in our opinion, SCR should better be interpreted as the fusion of m(.) with\na particular subjective bba mS (A) = 1 rather than an objective belief conditioning rule. This fundamental\nremark motivated us to develop a new family of BCR [34] based on hyper-power set decomposition (HPSD)\nexplained briefly in the next section. It turns out that many BCR are possible because the redistribution of\nmasses of elements outside of A (the conditioning event) to those inside A can be done in n-ways. This will be\nbriefly presented right after the next section.\n\n7.2\n\nHyper-Power Set Secomposition (HPSD)\n\nLet \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , . . . , \u03b8n }, n \u2265 2, a model M(\u0398) associated for \u0398 (free DSm model, hybrid or Shafer's\nmodel) and its corresponding hyper-power\nset D \u0398 . Let's consider a (quantitative) basic belief assignment\nP\n\u0398\n(bba) m(.) : D 7\u2192 [0, 1] such that X\u2208D\u0398 m(X) = 1. Suppose one finds out that the truth is in the set\nA \u2208 D \u0398 \\ {\u2205}. Let PD (A) = 2A \u2229 D \u0398 \\ {\u2205}, i.e. all non-empty\nparts (subsets) of A which are included\nP\nin D \u0398 . Let's consider the normal cases when A 6= \u2205 and Y \u2208PD (A) m(Y ) > 0. For the degenerate case\nwhen the truth is in A = \u2205, we consider Smets' open-world, which means that there are other hypotheses\n\u2032\n\u0398\u2032 = {\u03b8n+1 , \u03b8n+2 , . . . \u03b8n+m }, m \u2265 1, and the truth is in A \u2208 D \u0398 \\ {\u2205}. If A = \u2205 and\nPwe consider a closeworld, then it means that the problem is impossible. For another degenerate case, when Y \u2208PD (A) m(Y ) = 0,\ni.e. when the source gave us a totally (100%) wrong information m(.), then, we define: m(A|A) , 1 and,\nas a consequence, m(X|A) = 0 for any X 6= A. Let s(A) = {\u03b8i1 , \u03b8i2 , . . . , \u03b8ip }, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 n, be the\nsingletons/atoms that compose A (for example, if A = \u03b81 \u222a (\u03b83 \u2229 \u03b84 ) then s(A) = {\u03b81 , \u03b83 , \u03b84 }). The HyperPower Set Decomposition (HPSD) of D \u0398 \\ \u2205 consists in its decomposition into the three following subsets\ngenerated by A:\n\u2022 D1 = PD (A), the parts of A which are included in the hyper-power set, except the empty set;\n\u2022 D2 = {(\u0398 \\ s(A)), \u222a, \u2229} \\ {\u2205}, i.e. the sub-hyper-power set generated by \u0398 \\ s(A) under \u222a and \u2229,\nwithout the empty set.\n\u2022 D3 = (D \u0398 \\ {\u2205}) \\ (D1 \u222a D2 ); each set from D3 has in its formula singletons from both s(A) and\n\u0398 \\ s(A) in the case when \u0398 \\ s(A) is different from empty set.\n\n\fD1 , D2 and D3 have no element in common two by two and their union is D \u0398 \\ {\u2205}.\nSimple example of HPSD: Let's consider \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 } with Shafer's model (i.e. all elements of \u0398 are\nexclusive) and let's assume that the truth is in \u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 , i.e. the conditioning term is \u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 . Then one has the\nfollowing HPSD: D1 = {\u03b82 , \u03b83 , \u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 }, D2 = {\u03b81 } and D3 = {\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 , \u03b81 \u222a \u03b83 , \u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 }. More complex\nand detailed examples can be found in [34].\n\n7.3\n\nQuantitative belief conditioning rules (BCR)\n\nSince there exists actually many ways for redistributing the masses of elements outside of A (the conditioning\nevent) to those inside A, several BCR's have been proposed in [34]. In this introduction, we will not browse all\nthe possibilities for doing these redistributions and all BCR's formulas but only one, the BCR number 17 (i.e.\nBCR17) which does in our opinion the most refined redistribution since:\n- the mass m(W ) of each element W in D2 \u222a D3 is transferred to those X \u2208 D1 elements which are included\nin W if any proportionally with respect to their non-empty masses;\n- if no such X exists, the mass m(W ) is transferred in a pessimistic/prudent way to the k-largest element from\nD1 which are included in W (in equal parts) if any;\n- if neither this way is possible, then m(W ) is indiscriminately distributed to all X \u2208 D1 proportionally with\nrespect to their nonzero masses.\nBCR17 is defined by the following formula (see [34], Chap. 9 for detailed explanations and examples):\n#\n\"\nX\nX\nm(W )\n+\nm(W )/k\n(35)\nmBCR17 (X|A) = m(X) * SD1 +\nS(W )\nW \u2208D2 \u222aD3\n\nW \u2208D2 \u222aD3\n\nX\u2282W, X is\n\nX\u2282W\n\nk-largest\n\nS(W )=0\n\nS(W )6=0\n\nwhere \"X is k-largest\" means that X is the k-largest (with respect to inclusion) set included in W and\nX\n\nS(W ) ,\n\nm(Y )\n\nY \u2208D1 ,Y \u2282W\n\nX\n\nm(Z)\n\nZ\u2208D1 ,\n\nS D1 ,\n\nor Z\u2208D2 | \u2204Y \u2208D1 with Y \u2282Z\n\nP\n\nY \u2208D1\n\nm(Y )\n\nNote: The authors mentioned in an Erratum to the printed version of the second volume of DSmT book series (http://fs.gallup.unm.edu//Erratum.pdf) and they also corrected the online version of the\naforementioned book (see page 240 in http://fs.gallup.unm.edu//DSmT-book2.pdf that all denominators of the BCR's formulas are naturally supposed to be different from zero. Of course, Shafer's conditional rule as stated in Theorem 3.6, page 67 of [24] does not work when the denominator is zero and that's\nwhy Shafer has introduced the condition Bel(B\u0304) < 1 (or equivalently P l(B) > 0) in his theorem when the\nconditioning term is B.\nA simple example for BCR17: Let's consider \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 } with Shafer's model (i.e. all elements of \u0398 are\nexclusive) and let's assume that the truth is in \u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 , i.e. the conditioning term is A , \u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 . Then one has\nthe following HPSD:\nD1 = {\u03b82 , \u03b83 , \u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 },\nD2 = {\u03b81 }\nD3 = {\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 , \u03b81 \u222a \u03b83 , \u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 }.\nLet's consider the following prior bba: m(\u03b81 ) = 0.2, m(\u03b82 ) = 0.1, m(\u03b83 ) = 0.2, m(\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 ) = 0.1,\nm(\u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 ) = 0.1 and m(\u03b81 \u222a \u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 ) = 0.3.\n\n\fx\n\ny\n\n\u03b82\n\u03b83\nWith BCR17, for D2 , m(\u03b81 ) = 0.2 is transferred proportionally to all elements of D1 , i.e. 0.1\n= 0.2\n=\n0.2\n= 0.4 = 0.5 whence the parts of m(\u03b81 ) redistributed to \u03b82 , \u03b83 and \u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 are respectively x\u03b82 = 0.05,\n0.10, and z\u03b82 \u222a\u03b83 = 0.05. For D3 , there is actually no need to transfer m(\u03b81 \u222a \u03b83 ) because m(\u03b81 \u222a \u03b83 ) = 0\nin this example; whereas m(\u03b81 \u222a\u03b82 ) = 0.1 is transferred to \u03b82 (no case of k-elements herein); m(\u03b81 \u222a\u03b82 \u222a\u03b83 ) =\n0.3 is transferred to \u03b82 , \u03b83 and \u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 proportionally to their corresponding masses:\n\nz\u03b82 \u222a\u03b83\n0.1\ny \u03b83 =\n\nx\u03b82 /0.1 = y\u03b83 /0.2 = z\u03b82 \u222a\u03b83 /0.1 = 0.3/0.4 = 0.75\nwhence x\u03b82 = 0.075, y\u03b83 = 0.15, and z\u03b82 \u222a\u03b83 = 0.075. Finally, one gets\nmBCR17 (\u03b82 |\u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 ) = 0.10 + 0.05 + 0.10 + 0.075 = 0.325\nmBCR17 (\u03b83 |\u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 ) = 0.20 + 0.10 + 0.15 = 0.450\nmBCR17 (\u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 |\u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 ) = 0.10 + 0.05 + 0.075 = 0.225\nwhich is different from the result obtained with SCR, since one gets in this example:\nmSCR (\u03b82 |\u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 ) = mSCR (\u03b83 |\u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 ) = 0.25\nmSCR (\u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 |\u03b82 \u222a \u03b83 ) = 0.50\nMore complex and detailed examples can be found in [34].\n\n7.4 Qualitative belief conditioning rules\nIn this section we present only the qualitative belief conditioning rule no 17 which extends the principles of the\nprevious quantitative rule BCR17 in the qualitative domain using the operators on linguistic labels defined previously. We consider from now on a general frame \u0398 = {\u03b81 , \u03b82 , . . . , \u03b8n }, a given model M(\u0398) with its hyperpower set D \u0398 and a given extended ordered set L of qualitative values L = {L0 , L1 , L2 , . . . , Lm , Lm+1 }. The\nprior qualitative basic belief assignment (qbba) taking its values in L is denoted qm(.). We assume in the sequel\nthat the conditioning event is A 6= \u2205, A \u2208 D \u0398 , i.e. the absolute truth is in A. The approach we present here is\na direct extension of BCR17 using FLARL operators. Such extension can be done with all quantitative BCR's\nrules proposed in [34], but only QBCR17 is presented here for the sake of space limitations.\n7.4.1 Qualitative Belief Conditioning Rule no 17 (QBCR17)\nSimilarly to BCR17, QBCR17 is defined by the following formula:\n#\n\"\nX\nqm(W )\n+\nqmBCR17 (X|A) = qm(X) * qSD1 +\nqS(W )\nW \u2208D2 \u222aD3\n\nX\n\n(36)\n\nW \u2208D2 \u222aD3\nX\u2282W, X is\n\nX\u2282W\n\nqm(W )/k\n\nk-largest\n\nqS(W )=0\n\nqS(W )6=0\n\nwhere \"X is k-largest\" means that X is the k-largest (with respect to inclusion) set included in W and\nX\n\nqS(W ) ,\n\nqm(Y )\n\nY \u2208D1 ,Y \u2282W\n\nX\n\nqm(Z)\n\nZ\u2208D1 ,\n\nS D1 ,\n\nor Z\u2208D2 | \u2204Y \u2208D1 with Y \u2282Z\n\nP\n\nY \u2208D1\n\nqm(Y )\n\nNaturally, all operators (summation, product, division, etc) involved in the formula (36) are the operators\ndefined in FLARL working on linguistic labels. It is worth to note that the formula (36) requires also the division of the label qm(W ) by a scalar k. This division is defined as follows:\nLet r \u2208 R, r 6= 0. Then the label division by a scalar is defined by\nLa\n= La/r\nr\n\n(37)\n\n\f7.4.2\n\nA simple example for QBCR17\n\nLet's consider L = {L0 , L1 , L2 , L3 , L4 , L5 , L6 } a set of ordered linguistic labels. For example, L1 , L2 , L3 , L4\nand L5 may represent the values: L1 , very poor, L2 , poor, L3 , medium, L4 , good and L5 , very good.\nLet's consider also the frame \u0398 = {A, B, C, D} with the hybrid model corresponding to the Venn diagram on\nFigure 6.\nA \u272c\u2729\nB\n\u272c\u2729\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\n\u2720\n\n\u272c\u2729\n\n\u272b\u272a\n\u272b\u272a\n\u271b\n\u272c\u2729D\n\n\u272b\u272a\n\u271b C\n\n\u272b\u272a\n\nFig. 6: Venn Diagram for the hybrid model for this example.\nWe assume that the prior qualitative bba qm(.) is given by:\nqm(A) = L1 ,\n\nqm(C) = L1 ,\n\nqm(D) = L4\n\nand the qualitative masses of all other elements of G\u0398 take the minimal/zero value L0 . This qualitative mass is\nquasi-normalized since L1 + L1 + L4 = L1+1+4 = L6 = Lmax .\nIf we assume that the conditioning event is the proposition A \u222a B, i.e. the absolute truth is in A \u222a B, the\nhyper-power set decomposition (HPSD) is obtained as follows: D1 is formed by all parts of A \u222a B, D2 is the\nset generated by {(C, D), \u222a, \u2229} \\ \u2205 = {C, D, C \u222a D, C \u2229 D}, and D3 = {A \u222a C, A \u222a D, B \u222a C, B \u222a D, A \u222a\nB \u222a C, A \u222a (C \u2229 D), . . .}. Because the truth is in A \u222a B, qm(D) = L4 is transferred in a prudent way to\n(A \u222a B) \u2229 D = B \u2229 D according to our hybrid model, because B \u2229 D is the 1-largest element from A \u222a B\nwhich is included in D. While qm(C) = L1 is transferred to A only, since it is the only element in A \u222a B\nwhose qualitative mass qm(A) is different from L0 (zero); hence:\nqmQBCR17 (A) = qm(A) + qm(C) = L1 + L1 = L1+1 = L2 .\nTherefore, one finally gets:\nqmQBCR17 (A|A \u222a B) = L2\n\nqmQBCR17 (C|A \u222a B) = L0\n\nqmQBCR17 (D|A \u222a B) = L0\n\nqmQBCR17 (B \u2229 D|A \u222a B) = L4\n\nwhich is a normalized qualitative bba.\nMore complicated examples based on other QBCR's can be found in [35].\n\n8\n\nConclusion\n\nA general presentation of the foundations of DSmT has been proposed in this introduction. DSmT proposes\nnew quantitative and qualitative rules of combination for uncertain, imprecise and highly conflicting sources\nof information. Several applications of DSmT have been proposed recently in the literature and show the\npotential and the efficiency of this new theory. DSmT offers the possibility to work in different fusion spaces\ndepending on the nature of problem under consideration. Thus, one can work either in 2\u0398 = (\u0398, \u222a) (i.e. in\nthe classical power set as in DST framework), in D \u0398 = (\u0398, \u222a, \u2229) (the hyper-power set - also known as\nDedekind's lattice) or in the super-power set S \u0398 = (\u0398, \u222a, \u2229, c(.)), which includes 2\u0398 and D \u0398 and which\nrepresents the power set of the minimal refi nement of the frame \u0398 when the refinement is possible (because\nfor vague elements whose frontiers are not well known the refinement is not possible). We have enriched the\nDSmT with a subjective probability (DSmP\u01eb ) that gets the best Probabilistic Information Content (PIC) in\ncomparison with other existing subjective probabilities. Also, we have defined and developed the DSm Field\nand Linear Algebra of Refined Labels that permit the transformation of any fusion rule to a corresponding\nqualitative fusion rule which gives an exact qualitative result (i.e. a refined label), so far the best in literature.\n\n\fReferences\n[1] J.
