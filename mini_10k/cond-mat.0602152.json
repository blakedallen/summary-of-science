The Newtonian equation of motion has the form\nd2 x\n= \u2212g + \u03b7(t) ,\ndt2\n\nh\u03b7(t)\u03b7(t\u2032 )i = 2\u039b\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g is a positive constant. With no loss of generality we set g = 1, \u039b = 1 throughout\nthis paper, since this can be achieved by rescaling [1] of x and t. At the boundary x = 0 the\nparticle is reflected inelastically. The velocities just after and before reflection satisfy\nvf = \u2212rvi ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere r is the coefficient of restitution. The simple model defined by Eqs. (1) and (2) is of\ninterest in connection with driven granular gases, see, e.g., [2]. Cornell, Swift, and Bray [3]\noriginally proposed the model and studied the case g = 0.\nAccording to Eq. (1) the mean energy E(t) =\n\n1\nv(t)2\n2\n\n+ x(t) of the randomly accelerated\n\nparticle at time t increases as E(t) = E(0) + t between boundary collisions but decreases,\nfor r < 1, in the collisions. Eventually an equilibrium is reached. In this paper we study the\nequilibrium distribution function P (x, v) with an exact analytical approach and simulations.\nIn related earlier work, but without gravity, we have considered (i) the equilibrium of a\nrandomly accelerated particle moving on the finite line between two inelastically reflecting\nboundaries [4, 5], and (ii) non-equilibrium properties of a randomly accelerated particle on\nthe half line [6, 7] and on the finite line [8] for absorbing, partially absorbing, and inelastic\nboundary conditions .\nThe equilibrium distribution function P (x, v) of a particle, which moves according to Eq.\n(1) for x > 0 and is reflected inelastically at x = 0, satisfies the steady-state Fokker-Planck\nequation [9]\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u22022\n\u2202\n\u2212\n\u2212\nP (x, v) = 0 ,\nv\n\u2202x \u2202v \u2202v 2\n\n(3)\n\nP (0, \u2212v) = r 2 P (0, rv) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwith the boundary condition\nv>0.\n\n\f3\nThe factors of r in Eq. (4) take the change in velocity (2) into account and ensure that the\nincident and reflected probability currents at the boundary have equal magnitude\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nI=\ndv vP (0, \u2212v) =\ndv vP (0, v) .\n0\n\n(5)\n\n0\n\nHere we have assumed the standard normalization,\nZ \u221e Z \u221e\ndx\ndv P (x, v) = 1 ,\n0\n\n(6)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nof the distribution function.\n\nThe main goal of the paper is to solve the steady-state Fokker-Planck equation (3) with\nboundary condition (4). In Section II we derive an integral equation for the distribution\nfunction P (0, v) at the boundary and show how to obtain P (x, v) from P (0, v) by integration.\nIn Section III the asymptotic form of P (0, v) for large and small v is determined, for arbitrary\nr, from the integral equation. For two particular values, r =\n\n1\n2\n\nand 31 , the integral equation is\n\nsolved exactly and the corresponding P (x, v) obtained by integration. We have also carried\nout numerical simulations of the randomly accelerated accelerated particle in a gravitational\nfield. The algorithm is described in Section IV, and the results of the simulations are\ncompared with our analytic predictions. Section V contains closing remarks.\n\nII.\n\nINTEGRAL EQUATION FOR P (x, v)\n\nThe Fokker-Planck equation (3) is readily solved by separation of variables. The most\ngeneral solution which vanishes for x \u2192 \u221e and v \u2192 \u00b1\u221e is given by [6]\nZ \u221e\n\u2212v/2\ndF w(F )e\u2212F x\u03c81/4,F (\u2212v) ,\nP (x, v) = e\n\n(7)\n\n0\n\nwhere w(F ) is an arbitrary function, and \u03c8s,F (v), with F > 0, is the solution of the ordinary\ndifferential equation\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd2\n\u2212 2 + F v + s \u03c8s,F (v) = 0\ndv\nwhich vanishes for v \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. This solution is given by\n\u0001\n\u03c8s,F (v) = F \u22121/6 Ai F 1/3 v + F \u22122/3 s ,\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Ai(z) is the standard Airy function [10]. Normalized as in Eq. (9), the \u03c8s,F (v) have\nthe orthogonality and closure properties [6]\n\uf8f1\nZ \u221e\n\uf8f20,\nupper sign\ndv v\u03c8s,F (\u00b1v)\u03c8s,G (\u2212v) =\n\uf8f3 \u03b4(F \u2212 G) , lower sign\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(10)\n\n\f4\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndF [ \u03c8s,F (\u2212v)\u03c8s,F (\u2212u) \u2212 \u03c8s,F (v)\u03c8s,F (u) ] = v \u22121 \u03b4(v \u2212 u) .\n(11)\n0\nR\u221e\nMaking use of Eqs. (7), (9), and the relation \u2212\u221e dt e\u2212at Ai(\u2212t) = exp (a3 /3) for a > 0,\n\none finds that the probability density P (x) for the position of the particle is given by\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u0002\n\u0003\nP (x) =\ndv P (x, v) =\ndF F \u22121/2 w(F ) exp \u2212(12F )\u22121 \u2212 F x ,\n(12)\n0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nand that the normalization condition (6) is satisfied if\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndx P (x) =\ndF F \u22123/2 w(F ) exp \u2212(12F )\u22121 = 1 .\n0\n\n(13)\n\n0\n\nTo invert Eq. (7), it is convenient to use the auxiliary functions [6]\n\u0003\n\u0002\nZ \u221e\ndG exp \u2212 23 s3/2 (F \u22121 + G\u22121 )\n\u03c8s,G (\u2212v) ,\n\u03c6s,F (v) = \u03c8s,F (v) \u2212\n2\u03c0\nF +G\n0\nwhich vanish for v > 0 and have the biorthogonality property\nZ \u221e\ndv v\u03c6s,F (\u2212v)\u03c8s,G (\u2212v) = \u03b4(F \u2212 G)\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\n0\n\non the semi-infinite interval v > 0. Functions of this type were first constructed by Marshall\nand Watson [11] and exploited in [6, 11, 12] in calculating first passage properties.\nUsing property (15) to solve Eq. (7) for w(F ), we obtain\nZ \u221e\nw(F ) =\ndv v\u03c61/4,F (\u2212v)ev/2 P (0, v) .\n\n(16)\n\n0\n\nSubstituting this result back in Eq. (7) and imposing the boundary condition (4) leads to\nZ \u221e\n2\nr P (0, rv) =\ndu uGg (v, u)P (0, u) ,\n(17)\n0\nZ \u221e\n(v+u)/2\ndF \u03c81/4,F (v)\u03c61/4,F (\u2212u) .\n(18)\nGg (v, u) = e\n0\n\nEquations (7) and (16)-(18) provide us with a strategy for calculating P (x, v). First P (0, v)\nis determined by solving the integral equation (17). Then w(F ) and P (x, v) are obtained\nby evaluating the integrals in Eqs. (16) and (7), respectively.\nThe kernel in integral equation (17) has a simple physical interpretation. The quantity\nvGg (v, u)dv is the probability that a particle moving according to Eq. (1) with initial position\nx = 0 and initial velocity u > 0 arrives with speed between v and v + dv on its first return\nto x = 0. Integral equation (17) for the equilibrium distribution follows immediately from\n\n\f5\nthis interpretation. For consistency with the probabilistic interpretation, Gg (v, u) should be\nsymmetric in v and u and normalized so that\nZ \u221e\ndv vGg (v, u) = 1 .\n\n(19)\n\n0\n\nThat the expression for Gg (v, u) in Eq. (18) satisfies both these conditions can be shown\nwith the help of Eqs. (9), (11), and (14).\nThe integral representation of Gg (v, u) in Eqs. (18) is useful because of the simple orthogonality and closure properties of the basis functions. Two other useful representations,\nZ\nsinh(\u03c0\u03b3)\ne(v+u)/2 \u221e\nd\u03b3 \u03b3\nKi\u03b3 (v)Ki\u03b3 (u)\n(20)\nGg (v, u) =\n2\n\u03c0 vu 0\ncosh(\u03c0\u03b3/3)\nZ 1\n\b\n\u0002\n\u0003\n3\n1/2 (v+u)/2\n(vu) e\ndy exp \u2212(v 2 \u2212 vu + u2 + 3vuy 2)1/2\nGg (v, u) =\n2\u03c0\n0\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u00d7 (v 2 \u2212 vu + u2 + 3vuy 2)\u22123/2 + (v 2 \u2212 vu + u2 + 3vuy 2)\u22121 ,\n(21)\nfollow from a classic paper of McKean [13], as shown in Appendix A. In Eq. (20), K\u03bd (z) is\nthe standard modified Bessel function [10, 14]. Expressions (20) and (21) are particularly\nconvenient for analytical (see Appendix B) and numerical calculations, respectively.\n\nIII.\n\nSOLUTION OF INTEGRAL EQUATION (17)\nA.\n\nAsymptotic form of P (0, v) for small v\n\nFirst we derive the asymptotic form of P (0, v) for small and large v from integral equation\n(17). Using representation (21) for the kernel, one finds that the ansatz\nP (0, v) \u223c v \u2212\u03b2(r) ,\n\nv\u05810\n\n(22)\n\nis consistent with the integral equation if the exponent \u03b2(r) satisfies\n\u0014\n\nr = 2 sin\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03b2 + 1\n\u03c0\n6\n\n\u0013\u00151/(\u03b2\u22122)\n\n.\n\n(23)\n\nThe dependence of \u03b2 on the coefficient of restitution r is shown in Fig. 1. As r decreases\nfrom 1 to 0, \u03b2(r) increases monotonically from 0 to 5/2. The probability density for finding\nthe particle at the boundary with velocity v diverges as v approaches zero, and the greater\nthe inelasticity, the stronger the divergence.\n\n\f6\nThe exponent \u03b2 has the value 2 at\n\u221a\n\nrc = e\u2212\u03c0/\n\n3\n\n= 0.163 . . .\n\n(24)\n\nFor r < rc , \u03b2(r) > 2, so that P (0, v) diverges more strongly than v \u22122 in the limit v \u0581 0.\nThus, for r < rc the mean collision rate, defined by the integral (5), diverges at the lower\nlimit, i.e., the randomly accelerated inelastic particle makes an infinite number of collisions\nin a finite time. Cornell et al. [3] argued that even in the absence of a gravitational field\nthis is the case.\nThe small v behavior (22), (23) is precisely the same as for a randomly accelerated particle\nmoving on the finite line 0 < x < 1 with inelastic collisions at x = 0 and 1 and with no\ngravitational field [4, 5]. In both cases the divergent behavior for v \u0581 0 comes from the high\nrate of low velocity inelastic collisions with one of the walls. For short times the diffusive\nchange in velocity due to the random force, which grows as t1/2 , exceeds the change due\nto the gravitational force, which is proportional t. Thus, the random force is primarily\nresponsible for the rapid return to the boundary and determines the small v behavior.\nIn both cases - the randomly accelerated particle on the half line with a gravitational\nfield considered here, and on the finite line with no gravitational field considered in [5] - the\ndistribution function P (x, v) remains smooth, extended, and normalizable for r < rc . In\nneither case does it collapse on the boundary. Thus, the infinite equilibrium collision rate\ndoes not lead to localization of the particle at the boundary.\n\nB.\n\nAsymptotic form of P (0, v) for large v\n\nFor large v one finds that the ansatz\nP (0, v) \u223c v \u2212m(r) e\u2212q(r)v ,\n\nv\u2192\u221e.\n\n(25)\n\nis consistent with integral equation (17) with kernel (21) if the quantities m(r) and q(r) are\nchosen as follows: For\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2264 r < 1,\n\nm(r) = 1 \u2212\nwhere\n\nln r\n,\nln[x(r)/r]\n\nq(r) =\n\n\u221a\n3\n1\nx(r) = +\nh\n2\n2\n1\u2212\n\n3 1\u2212r\n,\n2 1 \u2212 r + r2\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2212q\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2212q\n\n\u00012 i1/2 ,\n\n(26)\n\n(27)\n\n\f7\nand for r < 12 ,\nm(r) =\n\n3\n,\n2\n\nq(r) =\n\n1\n.\n2r\n\n(28)\n\nThe functions m(r) and q(r) are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. As r decreases\nfrom 1 to 12 , m(r) increases from 0 to 1 and then changes discontinuously to\n\n3\n2\n\nfor r < 21 .\n\nAs r decreases from 1 to 0, q(r) increases monotonically from 0 to \u221e. The functional form\nof q(r) changes at r = 21 , in accordance with Eqs. (26) and (28). Both q and dq/dr are\ncontinuous at r = 1/2, but d2 q/dr 2 is discontinuous.\nThe functions m(r) and q(r) are both non-analytic at r = 21 . Since they only characterize\nP (0, v) in the large v limit (see Eq. (25)), it does not follow that P (x, v) is non-analytic in\nr for fixed finite x and v. We have not found any indication of a phase transition, i.e., a\nnon-analyticity of the distribution function P (x, v), as r is varied with x and v fixed.\n\nC.\n\nExact P (0, v) for r =\n\n1\n2\n\nand\n\nThe curves for \u03b2(r) and m(r) in Fig. 1 cross at r =\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n3\n\nand 13 . For these two values of\n\nr, the exponents in the asymptotic forms (22) and (25) for small and large v are the same,\nwith \u03b2( 12 ) = m( 21 ) = 1 and \u03b2( 13 ) = m( 13 ) = 23 . In fact, the functions\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 A v \u22121 e\u2212v ,\nr = 12 ,\n1/2\nP (0, v) =\n\uf8f3 A1/3 v \u22123/2 e\u22123v/2 ,\nr = 31 ,\n\n(29)\n\nturn out to be exact solutions of integral equation (17) for all 0 < v < \u221e, as we discovered\nnumerically and prove analytically in Appendix B. The quantities A1/2 and A1/3 in Eq. (29)\nare normalization constants, which we now determine.\nSubstituting Eq. (29) in Eq. (16) and making use of Eqs. (9) and (14), we find that the\ncorresponding w(F ) are given by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 1 A F \u22121/2 exp [\u2212(12F )\u22121 ] ,\n2 1/2\nw(F ) =\n\uf8f3 2 \u00011/2 A1/3 F \u22121/2 K1/6 ((12F )\u22121) ,\n27\u03c0\n\nr=\n\n1\n2\n\n,\n\nr=\n\n1\n3\n\n,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere K\u03bd (z), as in Eq.

In the limit x \u2192 0, P (x) diverges as log x and\n\nand 13 , respectively, and as x(1\u2212\u03b2)/3 for general r, as in Ref. [5]. In the\np\np\nlimit x \u2192 \u221e, P (x) decays as x\u22121/4 exp(\u2212 2x/3) and x\u22121/2 exp(\u2212 2x/3) for r = 12 and 31 ,\n1\n2\n\nx\u22121/6 for r =\nrespectively.\n\nThe distribution function P (x, v) may be calculated numerically for r =\n\n1\n2\n\nand\n\n1\n3\n\nby\n\ncombining Eqs. (7), (9), (30), and (31) and carrying out the integration over F numerically.\nThe v dependence of P (x, v) for r =\n\n1\n2\n\nand several values of x is shown in Fig. 3. For r =\n\n1\n3\n\nthe curves are qualitatively similar. In both cases the curve for x = 0 diverges at v = 0,\nin accordance with Eqs. (22) and (23). For x > 0 the divergence is replaced by a smooth\npeak, which becomes lower and broader as x increases.\np\nFor large x the height of the peak in Fig. 3 varies as P (x, 0) \u223c x\u22121/2 exp(\u2212 2x/3) for\np\nr = 21 and as P (x, 0) \u223c x\u22123/4 exp(\u2212 2x/3) for r = 31 . For small x, P (x, 0) \u223c x\u22121/3 and\n\nx\u22121/2 for r =\n\n1\n2\n\nand 13 , respectively, and P (x, 0) \u223c x\u2212\u03b2/3 for general r, as in Ref. [5].\n\nThe curves in Fig. 3 are characterized by the moments\nZ \u221e\nn\n\u22121\nhv ix = P (x)\ndv v n P (x, v) ,\n\n(33)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere the normalizing denominator P (x) is defined by Eq. (12). Taking the derivative of\nEq. (33) with respect to x, making use of the Fokker-Planck equation (3), and integrating\npartially with respect to v, one finds that\nhvix = 0 ,\nhv 2 ix = P (x)\u22121\n\n(34)\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndx P (x) .\n\n(35)\n\nx\n\nAccording to Eqs. (5), (33), and (34) the net probability current at a distance x from the\nboundary vanishes, as expected in equilibrium. Inserting the asymptotic form of P (x), given\n1/2\n\njust below Eq. (32), in Eq. (35), one finds that the root-mean-square width hv 2 ix\npeak in Fig. 3 increases as x1/4 in the large x limit, for both r =\n\n1\n2\n\nand 13 .\n\nof the\n\n\f9\nIV.\n\nSIMULATIONS\nA.\n\nAlgorithm\n\nIn our simulations the motion of the particle is governed by the difference equations\nxn+1\n\n1\n= xn + vn \u2206n+1 \u2212 \u22062n+1 +\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1 3\n\u2206\n6 n+1\n\n\u00131/2\n\n(sn+1 +\n\nvn+1 = vn \u2212 \u2206n+1 + (2\u2206n+1 )1/2 rn+1 .\n\n\u221a\n\n3 rn+1 ) ,\n\n(36)\n(37)\n\nHere xn and vn are the position and velocity at time tn , and \u2206n+1 = tn+1 \u2212 tn . The\nquantities rn and sn are independent Gaussian random numbers with hrn i = hsn i = 0 and\n\nhrn2 i = hs2n i = 1. This is the same as the algorithm in Refs. [8, 15], except that a gravitational\nfield g = 1 has been included.\nThe algorithm (36), (37) is consistent with the exact probability distribution\nPgfree(x, v; x0 , v0 ; t) in free space, i.e. in the absence of boundaries, of a randomly accelerated particle in a gravitational field g = 1 with initial conditions x0 , v0 at t = 0. This\n\nquantity satisfies the time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation (A1) (see Appendix A) with\ninitial condition (A2). The exact form of Pgfree(x, v; x0 , v0 ; t) follows immediately from Eq.\n(A4) and the expression for P0free(x, v; x0 , v0 ; t) in Eq. (27) of [15]\nIn free space there is no time-step error in the algorithm (36), (37). The time step \u2206n+1 is\narbitrary. However, for a particle on the half line x > 0, trajectories are not generated with\nthe correct probability close to the boundary. This is because Pgfree(x, v; x0 , v0 ; t) includes\ntrajectories which travel from positive to negative x and return during the time t, violating\nthe restriction x > 0. As in Refs. [8, 15], we make the time step smaller near the boundary\nto exclude these spurious trajectories. Generalizing the discussion in Ref. [8] to include\na gravitational field g = 1, we find that the spurious trajectories occur with negligible\nprobability if the time step satisfies\n1\n3/2\nxn + vn \u2206n+1 \u2212 \u22062n+1 \u2212 c\u2206n+1 > 0 ,\n2\n\n(38)\n\nwhere the constant c is about 5 or larger.\nThe most efficient time step is the largest \u2206n+1 consistent with inequality (38), which we\ndenote by D(xn , vn ). Using a smaller time step slows the simulation without improving the\naccuracy. A convenient choice is \u2206n+1 = D(xn , vn ) + \u03b4, where a small minimum time step\n\n\f10\nhas been included. Without it, the step size decreases to zero as the particle approaches the\nboundary, and it never gets there.\nFor small r the typical speed of the particle becomes extremely small after many boundary\ncollisions. To simulate the behavior reliably, we reduced the minimum time step \u03b4 as the\nspeed decreased, following Ref. [8]. After each boundary collision we set the root-mean\nsquare velocity change \u2206v = (2\u03b4)1/2 , corresponding to the minimum time step, equal to to\n1/500 of the velocity just after the collision and then used this value of \u03b4 until the next\nboundary collision. This \u2206v is the smallest velocity the algorithm can handle reliably.\n\nB.\n\nResults\n\nAccording to Eq. (5) the equilibrium rate of boundary collisions in which the particle is\nreflected with velocity between v and v + dv is given by P (0, v) v dv. We used this relation\nto determine P (0, v) from our simulations.\nIn Fig. 4 the simulation results for r = 0.75 and r = 0.25 are compared with the exact\nasymptotic forms (22), (23) and (25)-(28) for small and large v, respectively. Varying the\nproportionality constants in Eqs. (22) and (25) shifts the dashed and solid curves vertically\nin the figure, without changing the slope. The proportionality constants were chosen to best\nfit the simulation data, and the fit is excellent.\nIn Fig. 5 the simulation results for r =\n\n1\n2\n\nand r =\n\n1\n3\n\nare compared with the exact\n\nanalytical predictions (29) and (31). No adjustable parameters are involved. The agreement\nis excellent.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn this paper we have studied the equilibrium of a particle on the half line subject to\nboth a random force with zero mean and a constant gravitational force which drives the\nparticle toward a single inelastic boundary. It is interesting to compare with the case [4, 5]\nof a randomly accelerated particle moving on the finite line between two inelastic boundaries\nwith no gravitational field. In both cases the equilibrium distribution function has the same\ndivergent behavior P (0, v) \u223c v \u2212\u03b2 for small v, given in Eqs. (22), (23). As discussed below\nEq. (24), this comes from a high rate of low velocity inelastic collisions with one of the\n\n\f11\nboundaries. In both cases the random force, not gravity, is responsible for the rapid return\nof a low velocity particle to the boundary.\nIn contrast, the equilibrium behavior for high velocities is different in the two cases. With\na single boundary and a gravitational field, P (0, v) \u223c v \u2212m e\u2212qv for large v, according to Eqs.\n\n(25)-(28). With two boundaries and no gravitation, P (0, v) \u223c exp[\u2212(v/vch )3 ], according\nto Eqs. (14) and (16) of Ref. [5]. Thus, in the case of two boundaries high velocities are\nfar more strongly suppressed. This is not surprising. Since a high velocity particle quickly\ntravels between the two boundaries with negligible change in velocity, the time between\ninelastic collisions decreases as |v|\u22121 as |v| increases. In the case of a single boundary and\na gravitational field, on the other hand, a particle which leaves the boundary with a high\nvelocity travels far from the boundary before it returns, and the mean time between the\ninelastic collisions increases linearly with |v|.\nWe conclude with quantitative answers to some simple questions one might ask on reading\nthe title of the paper: What is the mean height hxi of the ball above the inelastically reflecting\n\nsurface, how large is the root-mean-square fluctuation \u2206x = h(x \u2212 hxi)2 i1/2 , and what is the\nequilibrium collision rate I ? In the two cases r =\n\n1\n2\n\nand\n\n1\n3\n\nwhere we have found the exact\n\nequilibrium distribution function P (x, v), Eqs. (5), (29), (31), and (32) imply\nr=\n\n1\n2\n\n:\n\n\u2206x = 10.4 ,\n\nI=\n\n1\n3\n\n,\n\nr=\n\n1\n3\n\nhxi = 6 ,\n\n:\n\nhxi = 3.89 ,\n\n\u2206x = 7.68 ,\n\nI=\n\n3\n4\n\n,\n\n(39)\n\nFor both values of r the fluctuations in the height of the ball are larger than the mean height.\nFor r = 13 , the mean height is smaller and the collision rate is larger than for r = 21 . The\nmean height is expected to decrease as r decreases but remain positive for all 0 < r < 1,\nsince P (x) remains positive and integrable. The collision rate is expected to increase as r\ndecreases and is infinite for r < rc , as discussed below Eq. (24). Finally, we note that these\nresults for g = \u039b = 1 in Eq. (39) are easily generalized to arbitrary values of the parameters\ng and \u039b in Eq. (1). In accordance with footnote [1], the numerical values in Eq. (39) for\nhxi and \u2206x are multiplied by g \u22123\u039b2 and for I by g 2\u039b\u22121 .\nAcknowledgments\n\nTWB thanks Dieter Forster for very informative conversations about the function Ki\u03b3 (v).\n\n\f12\nAPPENDIX A: ALTERNATE EXPRESSIONS FOR Gg (v, u)\n\nTo discuss first-passage properties, we define Pg (x, v; x0 , v0 ; t)dxdv as the probability that\nthe position and velocity of a particle, moving on the half line x > 0 according to Eq.
