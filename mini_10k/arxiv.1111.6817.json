The result obtained by using the coherent states having\na further degree of freedom (proposed in [20]) is compatible with Pauli's exclusion principle\nreassuring the fact that noncommutative quantum mechanics may in some way encode the\nnotion of physical extent and structure.\nKeywords: Noncommutative quantum mechanics\nPACS: 11.10.Nx\n\nThere seems to be growing consensus that our notion of spacetime has to be drastically\nrevised in a consistent formulation of quantum mechanics and gravity [1, 2]. One possible\ngeneralization, suggested by string theory [3], which has attracted much interest recently is\nthat of noncommutative spacetime [4]. This led to intense activities on the possible physical\nconsequences of noncommutativity in quantum mechanics [5]-[11], quantum electrodynamics\n[12], the standard model [13]-[16] and cosmology [17, 18].\nAn interesting feature of noncommutative quantum mechanics and quantum field theories\nthat has been observed in the literature is that such theories admit a description in terms of\nextended objects. Indeed, it has been shown [19] that a free particle moving in the noncommutative plane can be thought of as two oppositely charged particles interacting through a harmonic\npotential and moving in a strong magnetic field. This demonstration therefore suggests that\nnoncommutative quantum mechanics may in some way encode the notion of physical extent and\nstructure thereby admitting a description in terms of extended objects.\nThe notion of spatial extent and structure within the formulation of quantum mechanics on\nnoncommutative plane has been explored recently [20] by introduction of coherent states over\nnoncommutative configuration space and the notion of a weak measurement as implemented\nthrough an appropriate positive operator-valued measure. The essence of the approach is the\n\u2217\n\nsunandan.gangopadhyay@gmail.com, sunandan@bose.res.in\ndebram@rediffmail.com\n\u2021\nfgs@sun.ac.za\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\fintroduction of position for the particle, which can be done rigorously in the formalism of [21]. It\nhas been argued in [20] that this additional structure may be interpreted as the physical extent.\nThis was done by first considering the path integral representation found in [22].\nIn this paper, we shall study the interaction potential between two particles using coherent\nstate formalism developed in [21]. We shall carry out our computations using the coherent states\nintroduced in [21] (satisfying a deformed completeness relation as we shall see below) and then\nrepeat the same exercise with the ones having a further degree of freedom introduced in [20].\nTo begin with, we present a brief review of the formulation developed in [21]. The first step\nis to define classical configuration space. In two dimensions, the coordinates of noncommutative\nconfiguration space satisfy the commutation relation\n[x\u0302, \u0177] = i\u03b8\n\n(1)\n\nwhere without loss of generality it is assumed that \u03b8 is a real positive parameter. Using this, it\nis convenient to define the creation and annihilation operators\n1\nb\u0302 = \u221a (x\u0302 + i\u0177)\n2\u03b8\n\n,\n\n1\nb\u0302\u2020 = \u221a (x\u0302 \u2212 i\u0177)\n2\u03b8\n\n(2)\n\nthat satisfy the Fock algebra [b\u0302, b\u0302\u2020 ] = 1. The noncommutative configuration space is then\nisomorphic to the boson Fock space\n1\nn=\u221e\nHc = span{|ni \u2261 \u221a (b\u0302\u2020 )n |0i}n=0\nn!\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the span is taken over the field of complex numbers.\nThe next step is to introduce the Hilbert space of the noncommutative quantum system. We\nconsider the set of Hilbert-Schmidt operators acting on noncommutative configuration space\nn\n\no\n\nHq = \u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177) : \u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177) \u2208 B (Hc ) , trc (\u03c8 \u2020 (x\u0302, \u0177)\u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177)) < \u221e .\n\n(4)\n\nHere trc denotes the trace over noncommutative configuration space and B (Hc ) the set of\nbounded operators on Hc . This space has a natural inner product and norm\n(\u03c6(x\u0302, \u0177), \u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177)) = trc (\u03c6(x\u0302, \u0177)\u2020 \u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177))\n\n(5)\n\nand forms a Hilbert space [23]. To distinguish it from the noncommutative configuration space\nHc , which is also a Hilbert space, we shall refer to it as quantum Hilbert space and use the\nsubscripts c and q to make this distinction. Furthermore, we denote states in the noncommutative configuration space by |*i and states in the quantum Hilbert space by \u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177) \u2261 |\u03c8) and\nthe elements of its dual (linear functionals)\nby (\u03c8|,\nwhich maps elements of Hq onto complex\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2020\nnumbers by (\u03c6|\u03c8) = (\u03c6, \u03c8) = trc \u03c6(x\u0302, \u0177) \u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177) .\nAssuming commutative momenta, a unitary representation of the noncommutative Heisenberg\nalgebra in terms of operators X\u0302, \u0176 , P\u0302x and P\u0302y acting on the states of the quantum Hilbert space\n(4) is easily found to be\nX\u0302\u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177) = x\u0302\u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177) ; \u0176 \u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177) = \u0177\u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177)\n\u2202\u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177)\n1\n[\u0177, \u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177)] = \u2212i\nP\u0302x \u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177) =\n\u03b8\n\u2202 x\u0302\n1\n\u2202\u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177)\nP\u0302y \u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177) = \u2212 [x\u0302, \u03c8(x\u0302, \u0177)] = \u2212i\n.\n\u03b8\n\u2202 \u0177\n\n(6)\n\nWe use capital letters to distinguish operators acting on quantum Hilbert space from those\nacting on noncommutative configuration space.\n2\n\n\fIt should be mentioned that the more standard approach to noncommutative quantum field\ntheory and noncommutative quantum mechanics is to deform the algebra of functions into a\nnoncommutative algebra through the introduction of a, in general non-unique, star product.\nThe current approach turns out to be equivalent to this as was shown in [24] and [25]. The\npresent approach, however, offers a number of advantages. In the context of noncommutative\nquantum field theories it provides a much more systematic and unambiguous derivation of the\nenergy-momentum tensor [24]. In the case of noncommutative quantum mechanics it gives\ngreater clarity on the issue of choice of star product, e.g. Voros versus Moyal, as well as the\nphysical interpretations associated with this choice [25]. Furthermore, this is the only approach\nthat has been used successfully to solve the noncommutative Schr\u00f6dinger equation for non-trivial\npotentials, i.e., apart from the free particle and harmonic oscillator. Indeed, explicit solutions\nfor the noncommutative well in two dimensions were constructed in [26] using this approach.\nThe minimal uncertainty states in noncommutative configuration space, which is isomorphic\nto boson Fock space, are well known to be the normalized coherent states [27]1\n\u2020\n\n|zi = e\u2212z z\u0304/2 ezb |0i\n\n(7)\n\nwhere, z = \u221a12\u03b8 (x + iy) is a dimensionless complex number. These states provide an overcomplete basis in the noncommutative configuration space. Corresponding to these states we can\nconstruct a state (operator) in quantum Hilbert space as follows\n|z, z\u0304) = |zihz|.\n\n(8)\n\nThese states also have the property\nB\u0302|z, z\u0304) = z|z, z\u0304)\n\n;\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\nX\u0302 + i\u0176 .\nB\u0302 = \u221a\n2\u03b8\n\n(9)\n2\n\nWriting the trace in terms of coherent states and using |hz|wi|2 = e\u2212|z\u2212w| it is easy to see that\n(z, z\u0304|w, w\u0304) = trc (|zihz|wihw|) = |hz|wi|2 = e\u2212|z\u2212w|\n\n2\n\n(10)\n\nwhich shows that |z, z\u0304) is indeed a Hilbert-Schmidt operator.

Similar results had been obtained earlier in the context of twist approach to\nnoncommutative quantum field theory [31, 32]. However, in this paper we have not made use\nof this (twist) approach to obtain the above result. The result is indeed a consequence of the\ncoherent state formalism on the deformed configuration space (3) developed in [21].\nWe now move on to carry out the same exercise using the coherent states (introduced in [20])\nfavouring the description of noncommutative quantum mechanics in terms of extended objects.\nTo proceed, let us consider the resolution of the identity (15) on the quantum Hilbert space Hq .\n\n5\n\n\f\u2190\u2192\n\nIt is easy to see (by using the decomposition of the star product \u22c6z = e\u2202z\u0304 \u2202z (22)) that one can\nwrite down the identity operator 1q in the quantum Hilbert space Hq as\n\u2192\n\u2190\ndzdz\u0304\ndvdv\u0304 \u2212|v|2\nv\u2202z +v\u0304\u2202z\u0304\n(z, z\u0304|\n|z, z\u0304)e\ne\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nZ\nZ\ndvdv\u0304\ndzdz\u0304\n|z, v)(z, v|\n\u2261\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\n1q =\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n(29)\n\nwhere the states |z, v) are defined as\n|z, v) = e\u2212v\u0304v/2 ev\u0304\u2202z |z, z\u0304)\n\n(30)\n\nand are coherent states in z with a further degree of freedom since they satisfy\nB\u0302|z, v) = z|z, v)\n\n,\n\n\u2200 v.\n\n(31)\n\nFrom eq.(29) it is evident that the states |z, v) form an overcomplete set in the quantum Hilbert\nspace Hq . Consequently, one may associate a positive operator valued measure with them,\nnamely\n\u03a0\u0302z,v =\n\n1\n|z, v)(z, v|\n\u03c0\n\n(32)\n\nas \u03a0\u0302z,v is positive and Hermitian on the quantum Hilbert space Hq and integrates to the identity.\nAs a result of this, one can once again define the corresponding probability distribution in z and\nv, assuming a pure-state density matrix \u03c1\u0302 = |\u03c8)(\u03c8|:\nP (z, v) = trq (\u03c1\u0302\u03a0\u0302z,v ) = (\u03c8|\u03a0\u0302z,v |\u03c8).\n\n(33)\n\nThis probability gives us information not only about the position z but also about a further\ndegree of freedom v, given that the system is prepared in state \u03c8.

The above result clearly shows that there is a finite probability of\nwhere G = 2m\ntwo fermions (having different degrees of freedom v1 6= v2 ) sitting at the same place (z1 = z2 )\nconsistent with our earlier observation made from eq.(28). However, the probability vanishes\nwhen both z1 = z2 and v1 = v2 . This is indeed remarkable since the introduction of the\nnew degrees of freedom is compatible with Pauli's exclusion principle. This is reassuring as\nthis computation suggests that noncommutative quantum mechanics may in some way admit a\ndescription in terms of extended objects [20].\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the referee for useful comments.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
