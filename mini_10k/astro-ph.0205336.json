The findings that AGN\nare often associated with other galaxies is believed to indicate that interactions between galaxies may play a role,\nsince interactions are more likely to occur in a dense environment. Host galaxies and their close companions have\nbeen found to display disturbed morphology (e.g. Bahcall\net al. 1997; Canalizo & Stockton 2001), also taken as a sign\nthat interactions have taken place. Even in cases where companion galaxies appear undisturbed in the optical, radio images taken at redshifted 21cm (of nearby AGN) show long\nbridges or tidal tails of HI gas connecting the AGN with a\nclose neighbour (Lim & Ho 1999).\nThese observations have raised the question of the existence and the nature of a physical link between the AGN\nand its environment. Two very different scenarios for this\nlink have been suggested, the merger/interaction and the\ncooling flow scenario.\nEllingson, Green & Yee (1991a) found evidence for the\n\nmerger/interaction scenario when they made multi-object\nspectroscopy of galaxies associated with optically luminous\nquasars. They found that the richest quasar host clusters\nhave abnormally low velocity dispersions compared to those\nof clusters in general with similar optical richness. This is\nconsistent with the idea that galaxy-galaxy interactions are\nrelated to the quasar phenomenon, (e.g. Hutchings, Crampton & Campbell 1984), since in dynamically young clusters\nwhere the galaxies have low velocities, the encounters between galaxies will be disruptive and perhaps trigger or fuel\nquasar activity in one of the interacting galaxies.\nFurther support for this was found by Yee & Green\n(1987) and Ellingson et al. (1991b) in their studies of quasar\nenvironments. Optically luminous quasars were found more\nfrequently in rich environments at z & 0.6 than at lower\nredshifts, suggesting that by z \u223c 0.3\u20130.4, the quasars in rich\nclusters have faded. Since the time elapsed between z \u223c 0.4\nand z \u223c 0.6 corresponds to the dynamical time scales of cluster cores, they proposed that dynamical changes in the cluster environments were responsible for the fading of quasars,\nperhaps as a result of lack of gaseous fuel after the clusters\nvirialize. Accordingly, highly luminous AGN should therefore not exist in rich clusters at low redshifts, but there are\nseveral examples which contradict this, demonstrating that\n\n\f2\n\nWold et al.\n\nthe requirement of non-virialized clusters is not sufficient.\nOne example is Cygnus A, a powerful FRII radio galaxy in\na rich cluster at z = 0.056. Two other examples, which we\nstudy in this paper, are 3C 295 and E1821+643. 3C 295 is\na powerful FRII radio galaxy in a cluster at z = 0.46, and\nE1821+643 is an optically luminous quasar at z = 0.297\nsituated in a very rich cluster.\nThe cooling flow scenario has been discussed by e.g.\nFabian et al. (1986), Fabian & Crawford (1990) and Bremer,\nFabian & Crawford (1997). In this picture, cooling flows in\nsub-clusters at earlier epochs provide fuel for the AGN, but\nas sub-clusters merge toward the present epoch, the cooling flows are disrupted and the quasar activity switched off.\nAlternatively, the quasar may switch off when the cooling\nflow gas is exhausted (Fabian & Crawford 1990). Several\nobservations have been made of extended emission-line gas\naround powerful quasars which seem to support the cooling\nflow model (e.g. Crawford & Fabian 1989; Forbes et al. 1990;\nBremer et al. 1992).\nHowever, it is not established yet whether extended\nemission line gas indicates the presence of a cooling flow.\nFor instance, the emission lines could be produced by radio source shocks instead of gas cooling out of the flow (e.g.\nTadhunter et al. 2000). The standard cooling flow model\n(Fabian 1994 and references therein) has received some criticism lately since XMM observations of cooling flow clusters\ndo not show emission lines at temperatures below 1 keV as\npredicted (Peterson et al. 2001; Tamura et al. 2001; Kaastra\net al. 2001). This suggests that the cooling flow model may\nneed to be re-evaluated, and in many cases mass deposition rates may turn out to be lower than originally thought.\nHeating by AGN has been proposed as a possible cause of\nthe apparent lack of cold gas, but new Chandra data seem\nto indicate that the coolest gas is close to the radio lobes,\ncontrary to what is expected if there is heating by the AGN\n(Fabian 2001).\nIf cooling flows were the chief mechanism for providing\nfuel to the most powerful AGN in clusters, we should observe more rich clusters with central, powerful AGN than\nwe do. In fact, most rich AGN host clusters do not contain\nanything more powerful than an FRI source (like M87 in the\nVirgo cluster). In a sample of 260 rich-cluster radio galaxies\nstudied by Ledlow, Owen & Eilek (2002), there are almost\nno FRII radio galaxies with luminosities at 1.4 GHz greater\nthan 1025.5 W Hz\u22121 .\nHall et al. (1995) and Hall, Ellingson & Green (1997)\nused X-ray data from ROSAT and Einstein to derive physical parameters, such as gas density and temperature, of\nAGN host clusters. Their aim was to distinguish between\nthree different models for the evolution of AGN in clusters,\nthe young cluster scenario, the cooling flow model, and a\nmodel of decreasing ICM density with increasing redshift\n(Stocke & Perrenod 1981). Three of the five clusters in their\nsample were not detected, but upper limits on their X-ray\nluminosity could be estimated. They found that neither a\ncooling flow nor a decrease in ICM density could explain\nall their observations, and proposed that strong interactions\nbetween the AGN host and another galaxy in the cluster\ncould be the only necessary mechanism to produce powerful\nAGN in clusters.\nIn this paper, we investigate the link between four powerful AGN and their environments by using weak lensing\n\nmethods. The weak lensing technique allows us to probe the\ndistribution of total mass (dark + luminous) in the AGN\nfields, and the mass distributions can be used to test the\nmerger/interaction and the cooling flow scenarios. The two\nscenarios make very different predictions about the dynamical state of AGN host clusters, and by investigating the cluster dynamics, it may be possible to find which, if any, of these\ntwo mechanisms are responsible for the AGN\u2013environment\nlink.\nA cooling flow is expected to be associated with a single\ndeep potential well in an evolved, virialized cluster (Edge et\nal. 1992), and in this case we expect a strong weak lensing\nsignal and a mass distribution characterized by only a single\npeak. In contrast, if the AGN activity is related to galaxy\ninteractions, these will be much more disruptive if the encounter velocities are relatively low and comparable to the\ninternal velocity dispersions of the galaxies involved. Consequently, a cluster that is still forming will be preferred, as\nin such a cluster there is an increased probability for lowvelocity encounters. A dynamically young cluster is expected\nto have an irregular mass distribution, possibly with several\nsub-clumps (Schindler 2001).\nOur method of cluster selection is based on the detection of weak gravitational shear and the presence of an AGN.\nThis is different from the usual methods of detecting clusters, by optical richness or X-ray luminosity. Whereas optical and X-ray cluster surveys are biased toward the most\nbaryon-rich systems, clusters selected by their weak shear\nsignal are biased toward the most massive systems in terms\nof dark+luminous mass. If there is a large range in the\nbaryonic-to-dark matter ratio in clusters, clusters with high\nmass-to-light (hereafter M/L) ratios will have been missed\nin optical and X-ray surveys. Although we present a caseby-case study here, it is nevertheless interesting to compare\nthe masses and the M/L ratios of the AGN host clusters to\nthose of clusters detected on the basis of optical richness or\nX-ray luminosity.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we\ndescribe the selection of the targets and review some of their\nproperties. Section 3 describes the observations and the data\nreduction. Before the weak lensing analysis is performed, we\ninvestigate the colour-magnitude diagrams of the clusters\nin Section 4. The purpose of this is to locate the colourmagnitude relation in the known clusters, E1821+643 and\n3C 295, and thereby identify cluster galaxies that do not contribute to the weak lensing signal. We also investigate the\ncolour-magnitude diagram of 3C 254 and discuss whether\nthere is evidence for a red sequence of early-type cluster\ngalaxies in this field. A brief introduction to the weak lensing\nmethod and how we measure the gravitational shear is given\nin Section 5. We follow the standard approach for groundbased data and use the Kaiser, Squires & Broadhurst (1995)\nformalism to correct for PSF anisotropies using the imcat\nsoftware, and the approach by Luppino & Kaiser (1997) to\ncalibrate galaxy ellipticities to gravitational shear. In Section 6, we present the results of the analysis by showing maps\nof the projected surface mass density in the fields, plots of\nthe shear profiles in the clusters, and estimates of masses\nand M/L ratios. The results are discussed in Section 7, and\nconclusions are drawn in Section 8.\n\n\fAGN-selected clusters as revealed by weak lensing\nOur assumed cosmology has\nkm s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a90 = 1 and \u03a9\u039b = 0 1 .\n\n2\n\nh\n\n=\n\nH0 /100\n\nTHE SAMPLE\n\nWe selected four powerful AGN with extended X-ray emission for this study. Two of the targets are well-known cases of\nan AGN associated with a galaxy cluster, the radio galaxy\n3C 295 and the radio-quiet quasar E1821+643. The other\ntwo targets are the radio-loud quasars 3C 334 and 3C 254\nwhich were found to have significant extended X-ray emission in moderately deep ROSAT pointings (Hardcastle &\nWorrall 1999; Crawford et al. 1999). For the former two\nsources, we know that the extended X-ray emission originates in the hot intra-cluster medium of the host clusters,\nbut in the latter two cases no host clusters are known. Their\nextended X-ray emission is however an indicator of clustered galaxy environments provided that the point-like Xray emission from the AGN has been properly subtracted,\nand that the extended component does not originate in processes associated with the AGN itself.\n\n2.1\n\n3C 295\n\nThis is a powerful FRII radio galaxy at z = 0.46 with compact radio structure. In the optical, the radio galaxy is classified as a cD, and its host cluster has been extensively studied both at optical (Mathieu & Spinrad 1981; Dressler et al.\n1997; Smail et al. 1997a,b; Standford, Eisenhardt & Dickinson 1998; Thimm et al. 1998) and X-ray wavelengths (Henry\n& Henriksen 1986; Mushotzky & Scharf 1997; Neumann\n1999; Allen et al. 2001). It is not a particularly opticallyrich cluster, most likely of Abell class 1 (Mathieu & Spinrad\n1981; Hill & Lilly 1991), but its velocity dispersion is high,\n\u223c 1630 km s\u22121 (Dressler et al. 1999).\nIn X-rays, it appears to be a dynamically evolved and\nrelaxed cluster with a high bolometric luminosity of LX \u2248\n6.5 \u00d7 1044 h\u22122 (Neumann 1999). It was suggested by Henry\n& Henriksen (1986) that the cluster hosts a cooling flow,\nlater confirmed by Neumann (1999). Allen et al. (2001) have\nstudied the cluster with the Chandra X-ray satellite and find\nthat the cooling flow is 2\u20134h Gyr old, with a mass deposition\nrate of 70h\u22122 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\n3C 295 was one of the first two clusters in which a weak\ngravitational lensing signal was detected (Tyson, Valdes &\nWenk 1990), and Smail et al. (1997a) have performed weak\nlensing analysis on this field using HST WFPC2 data. The\ncluster displays signs of strong lensing and a quadruple lens\nhas also been found (Fisher, Schade & Barrientos 1998; Lubin et al. 2000). Since this cluster is well-studied, it serves\nas a consistency check on our techniques.\n\nMcLeod & McLeod 2001) at the centre of a very rich Abell\nclass & 2 cluster (Schneider et al. 1992; Lacy, Rawlings &\nHill 1992). The quasar is detected at radio wavelengths, has\na compact core, a one-sided jet, and a radio luminosity of\nL5GHz \u2248 1.2\u00d71023 h\u22122 W Hz\u22121 sr\u22121 (Lacy et al. 1992; Blundell et al. 1996), but is classified as radio-quiet because of\nits high optical luminosity, MB \u2248 \u221227.\nThe surrounding cluster was first noted in the optical by\nHutchings & Neff (1991) who believed it was background to\nthe quasar, but Schneider et al. (1992) took spectra of eight\ngalaxies in the field, and found that six of them belonged\nto a cluster at the quasar redshift. Subsequently, spectra\nof several galaxies in this field have been obtained in studies of Ly\u03b1 absorption systems (Le Brun et al. 1996; Tripp\net al. 1998), and using published spectroscopic redshifts of\n42 galaxies the cluster velocity dispersion is estimated to\n1182\u00b119 km s\u22121 (kindly provided to us by B. Holden, using\nthe biweight algorithm of Beers, Flynn & Gebhardt (1990)\nand a jackknife technique to estimate errors).\nEven though it is one of the most X-ray luminous clusters known, with a bolometric luminosity of LX \u223c 1045 h\u22122\nerg s\u22121 (Saxton et al. 1997), it went undetected in X-rays\nfor a long time due to the presence of the dominant quasar\npoint source. But recently, Saxton et al. (1997) and Hall\net al. (1997) reported detections of excess X-ray emission\naround the quasar in ROSAT data. The X-ray data gave no\nfirm evidence for a cooling flow, and observations made by\nFried (1998) of extended emission-line gas around the quasar\nsuggest that no cooling flow is present since the [oiii]/[oii]\nemission-line ratio does not increase outward as expected in\na cooling flow.\nIt has been pointed out that this quasar has many of\nthe properties typical of radio-loud quasars. It has a giant\nelliptical host, lies in a rich cluster, and the [oiii] luminosity in the extended emission-line region is more typical of\nthat found in radio-loud quasars (Fried 1998, and references\ntherein). However, E1821+643 fits well in with quasars from\nthe FIRST Bright Quasar Survey (FBQS, Gregg et al. 1996;\nWhite et al. 2000) in the radio luminosity\u2013optical luminosity\nplane. Lacy et al. (2001) used the FBQS to show that there\nis a continuous variation of radio luminosity with black hole\nmass for quasars. Using the H\u03b2 line width of E1821+643\n(Kolman et al. 1993), an estimate of the black hole mass\ncan be made (Kaspi et al. 1999), and we find that the black\nhole in E1821+643 has a mass of \u223c 1 \u00d7 109 h\u22121 M\u2299 (for\ndetails, see Lacy et al. 2001). With this black hole mass and\nits radio luminosity, it fits very well the radio-luminosity \u2013\nblack hole mass relation of Lacy et al. and is therefore similar to the FBQS objects. E1821+643 might not be such a\nspecial case after all, and is probably typical of highly luminous radio-quiet quasars.\n2.3\n\n2.2\n\nE1821+643\n\nThis is an optically luminous quasar at z = 0.297 residing in a giant elliptical host galaxy (Hutchings & Neff 1991;\n1\n\nFor this geometry, one arcsec is equivalent to 2.7h\u22121 kpc at\nz = 0.297, 3.4h\u22121 kpc at z = 0.46, 3.7h\u22121 kpc at z = 0.555 and\n4.0h\u22121 kpc at z = 0.734, the redshifts of the targets in this study.\n\n3\n\n3C 334 and 3C 254\n\nThese are two powerful steep-spectrum radio-loud quasars at\nz = 0.555 and z = 0.734, respectively, and are the most distant quasars in our study. They were included in the sample\nbecause there exists evidence that they are surrounded by\nextended X-ray emission. At rest frame 0.1\u20132.0 keV, Crawford et al. (1999) find X-ray luminosities of 0.8\u20132.0\u00d71044 h\u22122\nand 1.3\u20132.3\u00d71044 h\u22122 erg s\u22121 for the emission around 3C 334\nand 3C 254, respectively.

Optical images reveal an apparent overdensity of galaxies around 3C\n254 (Bremer 1997), and Hintzen (1984) find a number of\nnearby companion galaxies to 3C 334, although Yee & Green\n(1987) do not find any significant clustering in this field.\nFurther suggestions that 3C 334 and 3C 254 lie in clusters\ncome from observations of extended oxygen line-emission\naround the quasars where the pressures inferred from the\noxygen lines are comparable to pressures in the intra-cluster\nmedium of nearby clusters (Crawford & Fabian 1989; Forbes\net al. 1990; Crawford & Vanderriest 1997). It is argued by\nForbes et al. and Crawford & Vanderriest that 3C 254 might\nbe embedded in a very massive cooling flow with a mass deposition rate of up to 250h\u22122 M\u2299 yr\u22121 within 20h\u22121 kpc of\nthe quasar. If the quasar is indeed associated with a massive\ncooling flow, one might expect that the cluster around 3C\n254 be very massive as well.\n\n3\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nImaging observations were made with the 2.56-m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) using the ALFOSC (Andalucia Faint\nObject Spectrograph and Camera) instrument equipped\nwith a 2k\u00d72k Loral CCD with pixel scale 0.189 arcsec, resulting in a 6.5\u00d76.5 arcmin2 FOV. The NOT/ALFOSC is a\nwell-suited instrument for weak lensing studies of clusters,\nboth because the field of view is relatively large, and because\nthe NOT site has excellent seeing conditions. A wide field\nof view ensures a large number of faint background galaxies\nto measure ellipticities on, thereby improving the statistics,\nand good seeing conditions minimize the noise in the determination of galaxy ellipticities.\nSince the seeing is improved at longer wavelengths, we\nused the I-band images for measuring galaxy shapes. We\ntherefore dedicated the time when the FWHM seeing was\n. 0.8 arcsec to I-band imaging, and observed in V -band\nwhen the seeing increased to 0.9 arcsec. The E1821+643\ncluster was also observed in the B-band since there is a\nplanetary nebula in this field (K1-16, 88 arcsec NW of the\n\n10800\n7200\n15600\n10800\n10800\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n13790\n21747\n15500\n\nquasar) which is relatively bright in V , but less bright in B,\nsince most of the emission comes from [oiii]\u03bb\u03bb4959,5007.\nThe integrations were divided into exposures of 600 s\neach in the B- and V -band, and 300 or 450 s in the I-band,\noffsetting the telescope 10\u201315 arcsec between each exposure\nto avoid bad pixels falling consistently on the same spot.\nWe had in total three observing runs to obtain the data\nfor this project, as summarized in Table 1. On the 1998\nrun, there were clouds and cirrus on several of the nights,\nand the conditions were therefore generally poor for doing\nweak lensing observations. A backup programme was done\ninstead, but occasionally during clear periods, we could return to the weak lensing programme. During the 1999 and\n2000 runs, the weather was clear and the conditions photometric.\nThe data reduction was performed using standard iraf\nroutines for bias subtraction and flatfielding. For the flatfielding, we used twilight flats, but we also flatfielded the\nI-band data with a skyflat formed by taking the median of\nnine object frames. By dividing with the skyflat we were able\nto remove a fringing pattern before the images were combined. The fringing pattern is additive and should ideally\nbe subtracted from the images, but we found that division\nwith the skyflat removed the fringes much better. For 10 per\ncent fringes, the error in the photometry will be \u00b10.1 mag,\nbut since our analysis is more critical to measuring galaxy\nshapes accurately, we chose a flat background level at the\nexpense of accurate photometry.\nAfter bias subtraction, flatfielding and fringe removal,\nthe images were aligned and coadded using the iraf tasks\nimalign and combine with combine operation set to average. In order not to confuse the detection algorithm in the\nimcat software, we also flattened out large-scale variations\nin the sky level by subtracting off a model of low-frequency\nvariations in the background level.\nThe photometric zero points were determined by taking images of standard star fields (Landolt 1992), and the\natmospheric extinction was estimated by observing the standard fields at different airmasses. Galactic reddening was\ncorrected for by looking up the amount of extinction in the\nNED2 . The NED values are based on reddening maps by\n\n2\n\nNasa Extragalactic Database\n\n\fAGN-selected clusters as revealed by weak lensing\n\n5\n\nSchlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998), and the extinctions\nare calculated assuming an RV = 3.1 extinction curve.\nWhen we aligned the images, we discovered that the\nframes from 1999 were rotated with respect to those taken\nin 1998 by 0.242\u00b10.005 degrees. The small rotation caused\nproblems when we combined the data from 1998 and 1999, as\nperiodically varying ellipticities were introduced when one\nset of images was rotated with respect to the other. We\ntherefore performed the weak lensing analysis on just the\n1999 I-band data, since these were both deeper and taken\nduring better conditions than those from 1998. The full data\nset was instead used when we estimated the light from the\ngalaxies in order to determine the M/L ratios of the clusters.\nIt is seen in Table 1 that the combined I-band images\nhave a better seeing (. 0.8 arcsec) than those taken in the\nV -filter (\u2248 1 arcsec), and with the exception of 3C 254, we\nused the I-band images for the weak lensing analysis. Since\nthe V image of 3C 254 is very deep compared to the I image,\nit was more feasible to use this for the weak lensing despite\nit being the poorer-seeing image. The I-band image of 3C\n334 is seen to only reach I \u2248 23.5, and more data is needed\non this field to be able to perform a reliable weak lensing\nanalysis.\nWe used two software packages for object detection. For\nthe weak lensing analysis, we utilized the imcat software\n(Kaiser et al. 1995) which is optimized for shape measurements on faint galaxies and weak lensing. During other steps\nof the analysis when more accurate galaxy photometry was\nwanted, we used SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996), which\nis specifically designed for photometry.\n\n4\n\nIDENTIFYING THE EARLY-TYPE\nCLUSTER POPULATION\n\nIn this section we investigate the colours of the galaxies in\norder to identify galaxies that are likely to belong to the\nclusters. We wish to identify probable cluster members for\ntwo reasons. First, because it allows us to exclude them from\nthe weak lensing analysis, thereby improving the signal-tonoise. Only galaxies behind the clusters can become gravitationally distorted, so both cluster members and foreground\ngalaxies will contaminate the weak shear signal. Second, the\nidentified cluster members can be used to estimate the optical light from the cluster, which will be useful later for\nconstraining the M/L ratios.\nTo do this, we studied the colour-magnitude diagram\nof the quasar fields in order to locate the locus of possible cluster galaxies. Early-type galaxies in clusters are\nknown to form a sequence in the colour-magnitude plane,\noften referred to as the colour-magnitude relation, or the\nred sequence. The sequence is remarkably tight with little\nscatter and is seen in both nearby and more distant clusters (e.g. Stanford et al. (1998)). Ideally, we would like to\nknow the redshifts of all the galaxies in the fields, but this\nwould require deep imaging in two\u2013three more filters so that\nphotometric redshifts could be obtained. Using the colourmagnitude relation is, however, a crude photometric redshift\nmethod, since it is based on the strong 4000 \u00c5 breaks in the\nspectral energy distributions of early-type galaxies.\nTo evaluate colours of the galaxies we used magnitudes\ndetermined within a 2.6 arcsec aperture, corresponding ap-\n\nFigure 1.

At the redshifts of the\nclusters studied here, the aperture corresponds to \u2248 7\u201310h\u22121\nkpc. The colour-magnitude diagrams for the three fields that\nwere observed in V and I are shown in Fig. 1. The colourmagnitude relation in the E1821+643 cluster is identified as\nthe almost horizontal band stretching from I \u2248 18 to 21,\nwhere it starts to blend with the background population. In\nthe 3C 295 cluster, the relation is less well-defined, because\nthe cluster is poorer and lies at a higher redshift. In the\ncase of 3C 254, we can use the colour-magnitude diagram\nto search for a cluster by looking for the signature of a red\nsequence. We return to this in Section 4.1.\nSince we are not able to exclude non-cluster galaxies by\nmeans of spectroscopic redshift, there will be much scatter\naround the red sequence relation in each cluster. In order\nto determine the zero points and the slopes of the colourmagnitude relations in the 3C 295 and the E1821+643 clusters, we therefore used a sigma clipping algorithm on regions\nin the colour-magnitude diagram where it was clear that the\nred sequences lay. In the case of E1821+643, this region was\ndefined at 18.0 < I < 20.0 and 1.5 < V \u2212 I < 2.5 for the\nV \u2212 I relation, and at 20 < V < 22 and 1.3 < B \u2212 V < 2.0\nfor the B \u2212V relation. For the 3C 295 cluster, the region was\nconstrained to 19 < I < 21.5 and 2.0 < V \u2212 I < 2.5. After\nthe sigma clipping, we fitted a straight line to the remaining\ngalaxies yielding the slope and the zero point. The results are\nlisted in Table 2 in the form colour = zpt + slope (m \u2212 m0 ),\nwhere zpt is the colour at the apparent magnitude m =\nm0 = 21. The relations we derive agree with those found by\ne.g. Ellis et al. (1997) and those predicted by Kodama et al.\n(1998).\nIn order to reject galaxies belonging to the clusters\nin the weak lensing analysis, we made cuts in magnitude\nand colour based on the derived colour-magnitude relations.\nFirst, bright galaxies at I 6 21 were excluded irrespective\nof colour to ensure that also bright foreground galaxies were\nremoved (a magnitude of I = 21 corresponds roughly to M\u2217\nat z \u2248 0.7). Thereafter, galaxies lying within 1\u03c3 of the V \u2212 I\ncolour-magnitude relation at I > 21 were rejected (\u03c3 is the\ndispersion in colour after the sigma clipping in the regions\ndefined above, typically 0.1\u20130.3).\nFor the E1821+643 cluster, we also used the B \u2212 V\ninformation since the early-type galaxies in this cluster are\nconfined to a small region in the colour-colour plane. This\ncan be seen in the upper panel of Fig. 2, where the red\nsequence galaxies stand out as an overdensity at B \u2212V \u2248 1.5\nand V \u2212 I \u2248 1.8. The lower panel shows the galaxies that\nare left after the rejection of early-type cluster galaxies.\nFor 3C 254, we rejected galaxies at V 6 22 in the weak\nlensing analysis, but did not perform any colour-cuts since\nno cluster is known a priori in this field. Since only I-band\n\nFigure 2. Colour-colour diagram of galaxies in the E1821+643\nfield. In panel a) we have plotted all galaxies in the field, and\npanel b) shows the galaxies that are left for the weak lensing\nanalysis after rejection of early-type cluster galaxies.\n\ndata were taken of the 3C 334 field, we excluded galaxies at\nI < 20.\n4.1\n\nThe distribution of red galaxies in the 3C 254\nfield\n\nThere are some features in the 3C 254 colour-magnitude\ndiagram that caught our eye and made us speculate (prior\nto the weak lensing analysis) whether this field contains two\nclusters. Ignoring the brighter galaxies at V \u2212 I \u2248 1, there\nseems to be an excess of red galaxies at I \u2248 19\u201321 with\ncolours V \u2212 I \u2248 2.3 resembling a red sequence. There is\nalso an apparent excess of galaxies at I \u2248 20.5\u201322.3 and\n2.5 < V \u2212I < 3.0 which is not seen in the other two clusters.\nSince this is the expected colour of early-type galaxies at\nz & 0.7, it could be the red sequence in a cluster at the\nquasar redshift.\n\n\fAGN-selected clusters as revealed by weak lensing\n\n7\n\nFigure 3. The results of the cluster-finding algorithm in the 3C 254 field. The panels show the smoothed galaxy surface density\ndistribution as a function of predicted colour-magnitude relations at different redshifts. The redshifts are, from top-left to bottom-right,\nz = 0.2 to 0.9 in steps of \u2206z = 0.1. The numbers on each plot show the colour range we assumed that observed L\u2217 elliptical galaxies\nwould have at each redshift, as well as the number of galaxies in each colour range (see text for details). Axis units are offset from the\nquasar in arcsec, and there are 30 greylevels in each panel, defined to span the range from maximum to minimum. North is up and east\nis to the left.\n\nIn order to investigate this in more detail, we derived\nthe surface density distribution of the galaxies as a function of colour. We followed the approach by Gladders & Yee\n(2000), who have constructed an algorithm to search for clusters in two-filter data (the 'Red-Sequence Cluster Survey').\nGalaxies on a cluster red sequence will be redder than any\nnormal foreground galaxies provided the two filters straddle\nthe 4000 \u00c5 break in the rest frame of the cluster. In this\nmanner, V - and I-filters can be used to search for clusters\nat z \u2248 0.4\u20130.9. We did not implement the whole algorithm\nsince we are not doing a large blank field survey, but merely\na simplified version of the first part which assigns probabilities to the galaxies according to whether they are likely to\nlie in a certain colour interval. If there is a concentration in\nthe surface density of galaxies in a particular colour interval,\nit classifies as a cluster candidate. The colour interval will\nthen be an indirect indicator of the cluster redshift.\nTo implement this, we defined colour-magnitude relations between z = 0.20 and 0.95 for every \u2206z = 0.05. The\nzero points of the predicted relations were taken to be equal\nto the V \u2212 I colour of an L\u2217 elliptical galaxy at the redshift in question. This was kindly provided by T. Dahl\u00e9n\nfrom his photometric redshift code, which convolves different galaxy templates with the NOT filters (Dahl\u00e9n, Fransson\n& N\u00e4slund 2002). The slope of the colour-magnitude relation\nwas taken to vary slightly with redshift, as predicted by Kodama et al. (1998) for their elliptical evolution model with\na formation redshift of zf = 4.5. We took the scatter about\nthe colour-magnitude relation to be \u2206 (V \u2212 I) = 0.3 so that\nit roughly matches the intrinsic scatter and the photometric\nerrors, the latter clearly dominating.\nWe identified galaxies likely to belong to the defined\n\nred sequences by selecting those that had a certain probability of lying in the colour interval, hc1 , c2 i, associated with\neach sequence. This probability was evaluated as the integral from c1 to c2 of a normal distribution with mean equal\nto the measured V \u2212 I and dispersion equal to the measurement error in V \u2212 I (for details, see Gladders & Yee 2000).\nThereafter, we evaluated the surface density distribution of\ngalaxies above a given probability and smoothed it with a\nGaussian of width 200 pixels (the same as we use in the mass\nmaps). The result is shown in Fig. 3, where each panel corresponds to a colour-magnitude relation at a given redshift.\nIn order to find a potential cluster in these plots, we looked\nfor well-defined peaks in the surface density within a narrow\ncolour range.\nWe find two distinct peaks in this figure. In moving\nfrom bluer toward redder colours, the first peak turns up at\n2.07 < V \u2212 I < 2.37, 70\u201380 arcsec N of the quasar. If this\nis a cluster red sequence, it is predicted to have a redshift\nof z \u2248 0.4. The second isolated peak shows up in the two\npanels spanning the colour range 2.56 < V \u2212 I < 3.00, and\nif these galaxies are early-type members of a cluster, the\npredicted redshift is z \u2248 0.7\u20130.8. It is thus possible that the\nsecond peak might be a cluster associated with the quasar.\nInterestingly, the cluster does not seem to be centered on\nthe quasar, but rather 40\u201350 arcsec to the S. If the quasar\nis associated with a strong cooling flow (Forbes et al. 1990;\nCrawford & Vanderriest 1997) in a cluster, we would expect\nit to lie at the cluster centre where the gravitational well is\ndeep. However, it cannot be ruled out by our data that the\ncluster might have a slightly higher redshift than 0.734, but\nit is unlikely that the redshift is higher than 0.85\u20130.9.\n\n\f8\n5\n\nWold et al.\nWEAK LENSING ANALYSIS\n\nA cluster of galaxies has a high enough mass density to\ncause deflection of light rays from distant galaxies behind\nit, thereby distorting their shapes. Depending on the surface mass density of the cluster and the alignment of the\nbackground galaxies with the cluster centre of mass and the\nobserver, different levels of distortions are seen \u2013 from giant\narcs and arclets to only weakly altered galaxy shapes.\nGiant arcs are produced in the strong lensing regime\nwhen there is good alignment and the surface mass density\nin the cluster centre is equal to or larger than the critical\nsurface mass density, \u03a3c ,\n\u03a3c =\n\nc2\nDs\n.\n4\u03c0G Dd Dds\n\n(1)\n\nHere Ds and Dd are the angular diameter distances to the\nsource (background galaxy) and the deflector (the cluster),\nrespectively, and the deflector\u2013source angular diameter distance is Dds . The weak lensing regime is characterized by the\ncondition \u03ba = \u03a3/\u03a3c \u226a 1, and in this case the background\ngalaxies are only weakly distorted. To detect this effect, we\nneed to measure the ellipticities of a large number of galaxies\nand look for a systematic shift, in particular for a tangential\nalignment of the galaxy shapes around the cluster centre.\nAs opposed to giant arcs, weak lensing occurs in every\ncluster, but is difficult to quantify because the background\ngalaxies themselves have an intrinsic distribution of ellipticities. This is the main source of noise in weak lensing analysis. In addition to this, the faint galaxies are smeared by the\nseeing PSF which will circularize the galaxy images and suppress the weak shear signal. There may also be anisotropies\nin the PSF causing it to change as a function of position in\nthe image. This might be caused by e.g. camera distortions,\nguiding errors, or strong winds giving rise to vibrations in\nthe mirror or shaking of the telescope. Also, the strain in\nthe instrument caused by its own weight changes direction\nas the telescope tracks an object across the sky, and this can\nhave an effect on the shapes of the galaxies.\nFortunately, well-developed techniques for measuring\ngalaxy ellipticities and correcting for PSF smearing and\nanisotropy exist. Here, we use the imcat software by N.\nKaiser in which the techniques described by Kaiser et al.\n(1995) are implemented. imcat detects objects by smoothing the images with a range of Mexican hat filters with different radii. The detection with the highest significance is\nentered into the catalogue along with parameters such as\nmagnitude, the radius rg of the smoothing filter which maximized the detection significance, and ellipticity. Galaxy ellipticities are evaluated as\ne1 =\n\nQ11 \u2212 Q22\nQ11 + Q22\n\ne2 =\n\n2Q12\n,\nQ11 + Q22\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the elements of the Q matrix are formed from the\nweighted second moments of the surface brightness.\nIn each image, we examined the result of the imcat detection process, and made masks when necessary to eliminate spurious objects. In order to include only galaxies likely\nto have well-determined shapes in the weak lensing analysis,\nwe accepted only galaxies that satisfied the following criteria: 1) rg larger or equal to the stellar radius, but less than\nsix times the stellar radius, 2) significance of detection (\u03bd)\ngreater than six, and 3) corrected ellipticity less than three\n\nFigure 4. Half light radius versus magnitude of objects in the\nE1821+643 field. Stars are easily identified as the objects on the\nhorizontal branch stretching from I \u2248 15 to 20\u201321. At I . 15,\nthe stars saturate and the branch turns upwards.\n\n(see Section 5.1 for a description of the ellipticity corrections). Stars with I < 22 were separated from galaxies on\nthe basis of a plot of half-light radius versus magnitude, as\nshown in Fig. 4, and removed from the catalogues. No attempt was made to separate stars from galaxies at I > 22.\nAt these faint magnitudes, the surface density of galaxies is\nlarger than that of stars by a factor of > 20 (Reid et al.\n1996), so the inclusion of faint stars will not affect our analysis. Bright foreground galaxies and probable cluster members were also taken out of the catalogues by making the\ncuts in magnitude and colour as described in Section 4. The\nnumber of galaxies left for the weak lensing analysis was\ntypically \u223c1000, see Table 3.\n\n5.1\n\nShear measurements\n\nIn the absence of photon counting noise, the observed ellipticity of a galaxy, eobs\ni , can be expressed as\neobs\n= esi + Pij\u03b3 \u03b3j + Pijsm pj ,\ni\n\n(3)\n\nwhere esi is the intrinsic ellipticity of the galaxy, the second\nterm is the shift in ellipticity caused by the gravitational\nshear, \u03b3i , and the third term describes the smearing of the\ngalaxy image with an anisotropic PSF. The P \u03b3 and the P sm\nfactors are the shear and the smear polarizabilities, respectively, and are determined by the getshapes routine in imcat,\n(for details, see e.g. Kaiser\nalong with the ellipticities eobs\ni\net al. 1995; Clowe et al. 2000).\nBy applying Eq. 3 to stars which are intrinsically circular (esi = 0) and not affected by gravitational shear (\u03b3i = 0),\nan estimate of 'stellar shear field', pi , can be made. To do\nthis, we identified unsaturated, bright stars in the images by\ntheir half light radii as seen in Fig. 4. The stars were used\nto investigate the variation of the PSF across the field by\nfitting a second order polynomial to pi using the imcat task\nefit. The polynomial was thereafter applied to the galaxies\nby adjusting their ellipticities with an amount \u03b4ei = \u2212Pijsm pj\nusing the task ecorrect.\nWe experimented with higher order polynomials, but\nfound that in most fields there were too few stars to al-\n\n\fAGN-selected clusters as revealed by weak lensing\n\n9\n\nKaiser (1997), which is also described elsewhere (e.g. Clowe\net al. 2000). The pre-seeing shear polarizability is defined as\nsm\nPij\u03b3 = Pijsh \u2212 Pik\n\nsh\u22c6\nPkl\n,\nPljsm\u22c6\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the asterisks denote values for stars. Under the assumption that the PSF is close to circular after the correction, the off-diagonal elements of the polarizabilities are\nsmall compared to the diagonal elements, so the polarizabilities can be approximated by P = 12 (P11 + P22 ). We\ntherefore calculated the average P sh\u22c6 /P sm\u22c6 for stars as\n\n\u001c\n\nP sh\nP sm\n\n\u001d\u22c6\n\n=\n\n1\nNstars\n\nX P sh\u22c6 + P sh\u22c6\n11\n22\n\nstars\n\nsm\u22c6\nsm\u22c6\nP11\n+ P22\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nand evaluated the pre-seeing shear polarizability as\nP\u03b3 =\n\n\u0001 1 sm\n1\nsm\nsh\nsh\n)\nP11\n+ P22\n\u2212 (P11 + P22\n2\n2\n\n\u001c\n\nP sh\nP sm\n\n\u001d\u22c6\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere P sh and P sm are provided by imcat.\nThe gravitational shear was thereafter found by computing\n\u03b3i =\n\nFigure 5. Ellipticities of stars before and after correction for PSF\nanisotropy in the E1821+643 field. Perfectly circular stars have\ne1 = e2 = 0.\n\nlow this. A second order polynomial was however found to\nbe satisfyingly correcting for any anisotropies. As an example, we show in Fig. 5 the ellipticities of the stars in the\nE1821+643 field before and after the correction. This field\nhas elliptical stars with systematic ellipticities up to \u223c 2\u20133\nper cent in one direction, but it is seen that the systematics have been successfully corrected for, and that the star\nellipticities are reduced to typically < 1.5 per cent.\nIn the 3C 295 field, we found systematic ellipticities of\n< 2\u20133 per cent before correction. The stars in the 3C 254\nand the 3C 334 fields, which were taken on the same observing run, have systematic ellipticities of up to \u223c 5 per cent in\none direction. We had exceptionally good seeing during this\nrun, down to 0.4 arcsec, and experienced problems with focusing the telescope owing to an almost undersampled PSF.\nIt is possible that the focussing problems might have caused\nthe stars to become slightly elliptical. There was also strong\nwind part of the time that might have caused vibrations in\nthe mirror and also given rise to the focussing problems.\nHowever, in all the fields, we were able to successfully correct for the systematics with residual ellipticities of < 1\u20132\nper cent uniformly scattered around zero.\nIn the next step, we corrected for the dilution of galaxy\nellipticities caused by the smearing by the seeing disk. This\nstep is done in order to convert the observed ellipticities to a\ngravitational shear. We followed the approach by Luppino &\n\nei\n,\nP\u03b3\n\n(7)\n\nso in order to convert the galaxy ellipticities to a shear, a\ncorrection factor of 1/P \u03b3 was applied. Each galaxy has a\n1/P \u03b3 factor associated with it, and in principle it is possible to correct for PSF dilution on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis.\nAs this tends to be very noisy, we followed the approach by\nHoekstra et al. (1998) by evaluating the correction factors\nas a function of magnitude and galaxy size instead. We split\nthe galaxies into bins in rg and magnitude such that approximately 20\u201340 galaxies fell in each bin, and computed\nthe median 1/P \u03b3 for each bin. Typically, the widths of the\nbins were 0.5\u20131.0 mag in magnitude and 0.2\u20130.5 pixels in\nsize.\nThe bins containing the faintest and smallest galaxies,\nthose that are most affected by the seeing, had the largest\ncorrection factors, typically 8\u201312, whereas a value of unity\nwas reached for larger galaxies which are less affected by\nseeing. Since the galaxies with the largest correction factors\nare also the ones with the poorest shape determinations, we\nassigned weights to the galaxies. For each bin, a normalized weight inversely proportional to the dispersion in P \u03b3\nwas calculated, and during the whole analysis, galaxies with\npoorly determined 1/P \u03b3 were given less weight.\nDue to the mass-sheet degeneracy (a uniform sheet of\nmass can be added without altering the shear), the quantity\nthat we measure from galaxy images is in reality the reduced\nshear, g,\ng=\n\n\u03b3\n,\n1\u2212\u03ba\n\n(8)\n\ni.e. a combination of shear, \u03b3, and convergence, \u03ba. Since we\nare working in the weak lensing limit where \u03ba \u226a 1, we use\nthe approximation that g \u2248 \u03b3. The shear field can therefore be directly inverted to give the dimensionless projected\nsurface mass density of the cluster.\n\n\f10\n\nWold et al.\n\nFigure 6. E1821+643. The two upper panels show the results of the mass reconstruction. To the left is the map of the projected surface\nmass density, \u03ba, and to the right, the signal-to-noise map of the reconstruction. The two lower panels show the distribution of light\nfrom the colour-selected early-type galaxies (left) and from all the galaxies in the field (right). In all panels, 60 grey levels were used,\nspanning from minimum to maximum. The spacing between the \u03ba contours is 0.014, and the signal-to-noise contours are labeled with\ntheir respective values. Negative contours are drawn with dotted lines. The quasar position is (\u2206x, \u2206y) = (0, 0). North is up and east is\nto the left.\n\n5.2\n\nCluster inversion\n\nWe used the original 'KS93' inversion technique (Kaiser &\nSquires 1993) to reconstruct the surface mass density from\nthe shear field. The KS93 algorithm determines the \u03ba field\nto an unknown additive constant and suffers somewhat from\nbiasing at the edges because of the finite field of view. However, it is easy to implement and has well-defined noise properties since the intrinsic ellipticity distribution is translated\nto white noise across the field. The surface mass density\nin each cluster was reconstructed on an 82\u00d782 grid with\na smoothing length of 200 pixels, corresponding to 38 arcsec. The typical resolution in the mass maps is therefore\n\u2248 200 \u2212 300h\u22121 kpc at the cluster redshifts.\nTo quantify the significance of the reconstructions and\n\nto test the reliability of the mass maps, we made signal-tonoise maps of the mass reconstructions of each cluster. This\nwas done by generating 100 mass maps by randomly redistributing the measured shear values of the galaxies while\nkeeping their positions. A noise map was made by calculating the rms in each reconstruction point, ~\n\u03b8, as\n\n\u03barms \u03b8~ =\n\n\u0001\n\ns\n\n\u00012\n\n\u03bai \u03b8~\n100\n\nP100\n\ni=1\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nThe noise maps show the expected noise level due to the\nrandom intrinsic ellipticities of the galaxies. Finally, a signalto-noise map was made by dividing the original mass map\nwith the noise map.\n\n\fAGN-selected clusters as revealed by weak lensing\n\n11\n\nFigure 7. 3C 295. The radio galaxy has coordinates (\u2206x, \u2206y) = (0, 0), and the spacing between the \u03ba contours is 0.013. For more\ninformation about the plots, see text and caption of Fig. 6.\n\nTable 3.

For comparison, we also show the distribution of\nlight in the fields. The early-type light distribution in the\nE1821+643 and the 3C 295 cluster was calculated by se-\n\nlecting galaxies that lie within 1\u03c3 of the derived colourmagnitude relations, whereas for the 3C 254 field, we selected galaxies in the colour range 2.5 < V \u2212 I < 3.5. Next\nto the early-type light distributions, we have plotted the\nlight from all galaxies with I > 17.\n\n6.1.1\n\nE1821+643\n\nAs seen in Fig. 6, the cluster is comfortably detected, and the\nmass peak has a signal-to-noise of 4.9. The mass distribution\npeaks approximately 11 arcsec E of the quasar, but the offset\nis too small to be significant. Probably, the peak is shifted\nbecause of random noise in the reconstruction.\nThe cluster appears to have a relatively smooth mass\ndistribution. The mass contours show an extension to the\nNW which is present at a signal-to-noise level of 2\u20133 (the\nresolution is \u2248 200h\u22121 kpc). It is likely that this is a feature of the cluster, since the same asymmetry is present\n\n\f12\n\nWold et al.\n\nFigure 8. 3C 334. Surface mass density and light distribution, see caption of Fig. 6. The quasar has coordinates (\u2206x, \u2206y) = (0, 0), and\nthe spacing between the \u03ba contours is 0.014.\n\nin the early-type light distribution. And, as expected, it is\nseen to be more or less washed out when we plot the light\ndistribution of all the galaxies (the quasar host galaxy is\nnot included in the light distribution since it is saturated).\nThe ROSAT PSPC X-ray image published by Saxton et al.\n(1997) appears to be slightly extended in the same direction as the mass map. An apparent ellipticity of the cluster\nwas also noticed in X-rays by Hall et al. (1997), but it is\nnot clear whether this ellipticity corresponds to the feature\nseen in the mass map. A recent Chandra image published\nby Fang et al. (2001) also shows ellipticity to some degree.\nWe find a strong lensing candidate in this cluster. An\nelliptical galaxy which belongs to the cluster (spectroscopically confirmed by Schneider et al. (1992), galaxy 'H' in their\npaper) has a close, very elongated neighbour 3 arcsec to the\nSE, see Fig.10. The neighbour is slightly curved around the\nelliptical galaxy and could thus be lensed by a combination\nof the cluster potential and the potential from the cluster\n\nmember. By masking out the 'lensed' galaxy and making a\nmodel of the elliptical cluster member using the stsdas tasks\nellipse and bmodel, we subtracted the elliptical from the image and performed photometry on the 'lensed' galaxy. We\nfound an I-magnitude of 21.09 and colours V \u2212 I = 3.15 and\nB \u2212V = 0.55. Judging from the red V \u2212I colour, the 4000 \u00c5\nbreak probably lies at a redshifted wavelength of \u223c8000 \u00c5,\nthus placing the galaxy at z \u223c 1. When properly modeled,\ncases like this can be used to put constraints on the mass\ndistribution and dark matter content in galaxies (e.g. Lubin\net al. 2000).\n\n6.1.2\n\n3C 295\n\nThe distribution of the surface mass density and the galaxy\nlight in the 3C 295 cluster is shown in Fig. 7. Also this cluster\nappears smooth in the mass map. Again, the mass peak is\nslightly offset (\u22487 arcsec to the E) from the position of the\n\n\fAGN-selected clusters as revealed by weak lensing\ncentral radio galaxy, but we attribute this to random noise in\nthe reconstruction. The peak is detected at a signal-to-noise\nlevel of 5.0, and the cluster appears somewhat elongated in\nthe NS direction. Neumann (1999), who observed the cluster\nin X-rays with the ROSAT HRI also note the elongation, but\nin the Chandra X-ray image taken by Allen et al. (2001) this\nis not seen.\nThere is evidence for strong lensing also in this cluster. We find a candidate gravitational arc 25 arcsec W and\n10 arcsec N of the radio galaxy, the J2000 coordinates are\n14:11:17.9 and +52:12:21.8. It is detected in I, but not in\nthe V image. Smail et al. (1997a) make a note in their paper\nthat the cluster displays signs of strong lensing, but do not\ngive the position of the arc. However, an arc is clearly visible\nin the WFPC2 image at this position, so this must be the arc\nfound by Smail et al. Gravitational arcs are usually found\nclose to cluster centres at approximately the Einstein radius.\nIf we take the Einstein radius to be at the position of the arc,\nthe Einstein radius is \u2248 22 arcsec, corresponding to 75h\u22121\nkpc. Assuming that the cluster core is a singular isothermal\nsphere and that the arc lies at a redshift of zsource = 1.0, the\nmass enclosed within the Einstein radius is 1.02 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121\nM\u2299 . For an arc redshift of zsource = 2, the enclosed mass is\n7.1 \u00d7 1013 h\u22121 M\u2299 . Upon identification of any counter images and further modeling, tighter constraints can be made\non the mass and the mass distribution in the cluster core.\n\n6.1.3\n\n3C 334\n\nThe result of the cluster reconstruction in the 3C 334 field\nis shown in Fig. 8 along with the light distribution of I > 21\nand I > 17 galaxies. As noted before, this field is not deep\nenough to obtain a reliable weak lensing result. We applied\nthe same selection criteria in this field as for the other fields,\nexcept that we allowed a slightly brighter magnitude cut at\nI = 20 (we also tried with I = 21), but as seen in Table 3\nthere are very few galaxies in this field compared to the other\nthree fields. The completeness limit is I \u2248 23.5, whereas\na limit of I \u2248 25 is preferred since most of the galaxies\ncontributing to the weak lensing signal have I \u2248 23\u201326. Our\ncurrent data can therefore neither confirm nor exclude the\npresence of a cluster in this field.\nThe cloverleaf-like pattern in the mass map may originate in the complex kernel in the reconstruction algorithm,\nand trying to reconstruct a mass map based on just one\ngalaxy would produce a similar pattern. However, the eastern peak in the mass map looks significant, so it could be\ncaused by a foreground mass concentration, but it is not supported by the galaxy light distribution. It is possible that\nthere is some systematic error in these data that we do not\nyet understand.\n\n6.1.4\n\n3C 254\n\nThis is the most interesting field, both because of the relatively high redshift of the quasar, and because there is a concentration of red galaxies in the image that may correspond\nto a cluster at the quasar redshift (see Section 4.1). As seen\nin Fig. 9, we have made a significant detection of mass in\nthis field. The mass peak in the V -band image has a signalto-noise of 2.8. Even though the I-band image is somewhat\n\n13\n\nFigure 10. A probable z \u223c 1 galaxy being lensed by a combination of the E1821+643 cluster potential and the gravitational\npotential from an elliptical cluster member. To the left is shown\nthe elliptical galaxy with the candidate lensed galaxy \u22483 arcsec to\nthe SE (the J2000 coordinates of the 'lensed' galaxy are 18:21:59.6\nand +64:19:47.6), and in the image to the right the elliptical has\nbeen subtracted. North is up, and east is to the left.\n\nshallow with a completeness limit of \u2248 24, there is also a\ndetection of mass in this image, although it is marginally\nsignificant with a signal-to-noise of \u2248 2.\nThe V - and the I-band mass maps are seen to peak at\ndifferent places, approximately 47 arcsec apart, but we consider it unlikely that they originate in different mass concentrations. Taking into account the level of noise in the\nreconstructions, they both probably correspond to the same\ncluster. The V -band mass map, which is the most reliable\nreconstruction, peaks 21 arcsec E and 34 arcsec S of the\nquasar. If the positional accuracy of the peak is related to\nsignal-to-noise as \u223csmoothing length/signal-to-noise, the 1\u03c3 error in the peak position is \u223c 15 arcsec. The position of\nthe mass peak might therefore be consistent with the position of the quasar.\nWe note that the mass peak lies closer to the peak in\nthe early-type galaxy light; the separation between the two\nis \u2248 10 arcsec. The early-type galaxy light corresponds to\nthe concentration of red galaxies that was discussed in Section 4.1 as a possible cluster at the quasar redshift. In this\nrelatively noisy reconstruction it is unfortunately not possible to tell whether the cluster is centered on the quasar, or\non the peak in the early-type light.\n\n6.2\n\nTangential shear and mass profiles\n\nWe now derive the surface mass density and mass profiles of\nthe clusters using the aperture mass densitometry method\n(Fahlman et al. 1994; Kaiser et al. 1994). This method converts the tangential component of the shear to a surface\nmass density profile, which is thereafter used to obtain a\nlower limit on the mass as a function of radius.\nFirst, we evaluated the azimuthally averaged tangential\nshear, hgT i, in annuli centered on the peak in the mass maps.\nThe tangential component of the shear is gT = \u2212g1 cos(2\u03c6)\u2212\ng2 sin(2\u03c6), where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle of the galaxy with\nrespect to the chosen centre. Thereafter, we calculated the \u03b6estimator which gives the mean dimensionless surface mass\ndensity within a radius rj relative to that in an outer control\nannulus at rj < r < rmax :\n\u03b6(rj , rmax )\n\n=\n\n\u03ba\u0304(< rj ) \u2212 \u03ba\u0304(rj < r < rmax )\n\n\f14\n\nWold et al.\n\nFigure 9. 3C 254. The upper row of panels shows, from left to right, the V -band mass map, its signal-to-noise map, and the I-band mass\nmap. The mass peak in V has a signal-to-noise of 2.8, whereas the mass peak in I has a signal-to-noise of 1.9 (the I-band signal-to-noise\nmap is not shown here). The spacing between the \u03ba contours is 0.018 and 0.007 in the V - and the I-band mass map, respectively. In the\ntwo lower panels are shown the light distribution of colour-selected (2.5 < V \u2212 I < 3.5) galaxies and of all I < 21 galaxies. The quasar\nhas coordinates (\u2206x, \u2206y) = (0, 0). See Fig. 6 for more details about the plots.\n\n=\n\n2\n2\n(1 \u2212 rj2 /rmax\n)\n\nZ\n\nrmax\n\nd ln r hgT i .\n\n(10)\n\nrj\n\nThe \u03b6-statistic gives a lower limit to the mass within some\nradius since the mass in the control annulus always will be\ndifferent from zero. In order to get a good measurement of\nthe mass it is therefore desirable to have a wide field so that\nrj /rmax \u226a 1.\nWe used the peak in the mass maps as centre for the\nannuli, and took the outer radius, rmax , to be as large as\npossible without loosing too much of the area of the outer\ncontrol annulus. The inner radius was typically 35 arcsec,\nsufficiently outside the Einstein ring for each cluster to assure that the weak lensing approximation was valid. The\n\u03b6-statistic is less well applicable to fields with two or more\npeaks in the mass distribution since the mass for one peak\nwill be biased downwards when the other peak lies in the\ncontrol annulus. The mass measured with this technique\ntherefore depends both on the strength of the shear signal\nand on the mass profile of the cluster.\nIn Figs. 11 through 13, we show the results of the aperture mass densitometry and the mass profiles for each cluster (from now on, we do not discuss the 3C 334 field). The\nleft-hand panels show, from top to bottom, the average tangential shear profile, hgT i, its \u03b6-estimator, \u03b6T , and its mass\nprofile. The right-hand panels show the corresponding quan-\n\ntities, but for the orthogonal shear component, hgX i. The\northogonal shear was found by rotating the galaxies 45 degrees, or equivalently, increasing the phase of the shear by \u03c0\nradians. It gives a measure of the random shear component\ncaused by the intrinsic ellipticities of the galaxies, and the\nvariance in gX was therefore used as a measure of the error\nin gT (Luppino & Kaiser 1997). To ensure that the weak tangential shear originates in gravitational lensing and not some\nother systematic effect, a good check is that the orthogonal\nshear component be zero within the statistical uncertainty.\nNote that the points and the error bars for the \u03b6-statistic\n(hence also the mass) are correlated since \u03b6(rj , rmax ) gives\nthe mean surface density interior to rj relative to the mean\nin the outer control annulus. As seen in Figs. 11 through\n13, there is a positive tangential shear detected in the three\nclusters, and the orthogonal shear component is scattered\naround zero, as expected if the weak shear is caused by gravitational lensing.\nThe mass profiles were calculated from the \u03b6-statistic\nby evaluating M (< rj ) = \u03c0rj2 \u03b6(rj , rmax )\u03a3c . It is thus seen\nthat the critical surface mass density, \u03a3c , has to be known in\norder to convert to an absolute measure of mass. From Eq. 1,\n\u03a3c can be seen to depend on the redshift distribution of the\nweakly lensed galaxies through the ratio \u03b2 \u2261 Dds /Ds . This\nratio is in principle unknown, at least at magnitudes fainter\n\n\fAGN-selected clusters as revealed by weak lensing\n\n15\n\nFigure 11. E1821+643.

We can however make a reasonable estimate\nof the redshift distribution of faint galaxies by using the\nphotometric redshifts that are available in the Hubble Deep\nField (HDF).\nFor this, we used the HDF photometric redshift catalogue by Fern\u00e1ndez-Soto, Lanzetta & Yahil (1999) which\ncontains \u2248 1000 galaxies, and followed the approach of\nDahle et al. (2002) by comparing the number counts of\ngalaxies in the cluster images with the number counts in\nthe HDF.\nThe F 814WAB magnitudes were first converted onto\nthe STMAG system using the tabulated values in the HDF\nweb pages3 , and thereafter to Cousins I using the prescription in the WFPC2 Instrument Handbook (Biretta et al.\n2000). Since we used the V -magnitudes in the 3C 254 field,\nwe also transformed from F 606WAB to Johnson V with the\nconversion V \u2212 F 606WAB = \u22120.09 (found by using the\nstsdas.synphot task to transform a galaxy with spectrum\nF\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u22121 ).\nWe grouped the galaxies in the cluster images and in the\nHDF into magnitude bins of width 0.5 between the magnitude limit used in the weak lensing analysis and a faint\n\n3\n\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdf/logs/zeropoints.txt\n\nlimit of I = 26 or V = 27. Galaxies fainter than this were\ncounted in one bin. For each HDF magnitude bin, a mean \u03b2\nwas calculated using the photometric redshifts. Thereafter,\nwe weighted \u03b2 in each bin with the normalized weights associated with the galaxies in the cluster images within the\nsame bin. The weighted \u03b2 values were finally added and a\nsingle weighted average h\u03b2i was calculated for each cluster.\nThis is equivalent to putting the source population at a sheet\nbehind the cluster. In Table 3, we list the values of h\u03b2i that\nwe used, and the corresponding sheet-redshifts.\nFor the 3C 295 cluster, we find a mass of (2.86 \u00b1 1.74) \u00d7\n1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 within a radius of 407h\u22121 kpc. This agrees well\nwith the mass estimate by Smail et al. (1997a) of (2.35 \u00b1\n0.38) \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 within 400h\u22121 kpc. Using Chandra Xray data, Allen et al. (2001) derive a mass of 1.05+0.40\n\u22120.25 \u00d7\n1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 within the same radius. Our estimate is thus in\nbetter agreement with Smail et al., but since our error bars\nare large, it is also consistent with the mass found by Allen\net al. Allen et al. discuss the discrepancy between the X-ray\nand lensing mass as possibly originating in mass along the\nline of sight which is detected via weak lensing, but not in\nX-ray images. There is however a possibility the outermost\npoint in our mass profile of 3C 295 might be overestimated\nbecause of the inclusion of the secondary peak to the south\n\n\f16\n\nWold et al.\n\nFigure 12. 3C 295.

The two asterisks at a radius of 22 arcsec in the lower left-hand plot correspond to the mass estimated by\nstrong lensing.

Overplotted\n\u22121 (solid and dashed lines).\non the shear profile, hgT i, is the best-fit SIS model with \u03c3v = 1205+161\n\u2212187 km s\n\nin the mass map. The mass within 300h\u22121 kpc is (1.38 \u00b1\n1.09) \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 , more in agreement with Allen et al.'s\nX-ray mass estimate.\nThe E1821+643 cluster is massive too, with a mass of\n(1.51 \u00b1 1.24) \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 within a radius of \u2248 400h\u22121\nkpc, but the most massive cluster appears to be that in the\n3C 254 field, with a mass of (4.28 \u00b1 2.86) \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299\nwithin \u2248 400h\u22121 kpc. The masses within radii of 200h\u22121\nand 400h\u22121 kpc in the three clusters are listed in Table 4.\nThere are several factors which may give rise to systematic errors in the mass. The value of h\u03b2i affects the mass,\nboth through the redshift distribution of the faint background galaxies and through the assumed cosmology. If the\nweakly lensed galaxies lie at systematically higher redshifts\nthan assumed here, h\u03b2i will be larger, so the clusters should\nbe less massive. For instance, if the source population for\nthe 3C 295 cluster is redshifted out to zsheet = 1 instead of\nzsheet = 0.8 as assumed, the mass within 400h\u22121 kpc will be\n(2.25 \u00b1 1.36) \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 . We have assumed an EinsteindeSitter Universe with q0 = 0.5 and \u03a90 = 1, but in a flat\nUniverse with \u03a9\u039b = 0.8 and \u03a9m = 0.2, both h\u03b2i and Dd\nwill be larger by a factor of \u2248 1.2\u20131.3, thus giving masses\nsmaller by a factor of \u2248 1.22 \u20131.32 .\nThe tangential shear is given by hgT i = \u2212d\u03ba/d ln \u03b8,\n\nand for a singular isothermal sphere (SIS), the surface mass\ndensity, \u03ba, is proportional to the velocity dispersion, \u03c3v2 . The\nshear profiles were therefore used to estimate the velocity\ndispersions of the clusters by minimizing \u03c72 . SIS models\nwith the best-fit velocity dispersions and their 68 per cent\nconfidence intervals are overplotted on the tangential shear\nprofiles in Figs. 11 to 13, and we also list the results of the\nfitting in Table 4.\nThe velocity dispersions we find are generally lower than\nthose measured spectroscopically. Dressler et al. (1999) measure \u223c 1630 km s\u22121 for the 3C 295 cluster, whereas we derive\n\u22121\na best-fit SIS model with \u03c3v = 1205+161\n. Likewise,\n\u2212187 km s\n\u22121\nfor the E1821+643 cluster, we find \u03c3v = 964+149\n\u2212176 km s\nfrom the SIS fit, but 1180 km s\u22121 from spectroscopy of galaxies in the field (Schneider et al. 1992; Le Brun et al. 1996;\nTripp et al. 1998). The discrepancy between the two methods of measuring velocity dispersions was noted by Smail\net al. (1997a), who suggested it could be caused by different velocity dispersions for different galaxy populations. The\nearly-type population has a lower velocity dispersion and\nis more centrally concentrated than the late-type population. Spectroscopically measured velocity dispersions thus\nbecome overestimated since they are often based on galaxies of different types lying at larger distances from the clus-\n\n\fAGN-selected clusters as revealed by weak lensing\n\n17\n\nFigure 13. 3C 254. Tangential and orthogonal shear and their respective \u03b6-estimators and mass profiles. The inner radius was 35 arcsec,\nand the outer radius 142 arcsec. The solid and the dashed lines in the upper left-hand plot shows the best-fit SIS model with a velocity\n\u22121 .\ndispersion of \u03c3v = 1244+243\n\u2212302 km s\n\nter core than that probed by weak lensing. On the other\nhand, Irgens et al. (2002) found for a sample of 12 clusters\nwith redshifts between 0.15 and 0.33 that estimates of velocity dispersions made from weak gravitational lensing and\nfrom direct spectroscopic measurements are in good agreement, with only insignificant systematic bias. Using either\ntechnique, however, it is clear that the clusters studied here\nhave very deep potential wells, and are at the upper end\nof the distribution of Abell cluster velocity dispersions (e.g.\nGirardi et al. 1998).\n\n6.3\n\nMass-to-light ratios\n\nThe M/L ratio parameterizes the amount of dark matter\nin clusters. We have already measured the amount of total\nmass in the clusters, and by estimating the optical luminosity of the clusters, we may find their M/L ratios. We\nprocessed the images in SExtractor with a tophat convolution filter matched to the seeing, and for each extracted object, aperture magnitudes within 2.6 arcsec and 'best' magnitudes were evaluated. Stars were identified on the basis of\na plot of FWHM versus the SExtractor star-galaxy classifier,\nand removed from the catalogues by rejecting objects that\nhad a star-galaxy class greater than \u2248 0.8 and a FWHM\ncorresponding to the seeing. The best seeing catalogue was\n\nthereafter matched to the catalogue in the other filter on\nthe basis of object positions, with a tolerance of 3 pixels. A\nfinal catalogue was then made containing galaxies detected\nin both V and I (or B, V and I for E1821+643).\nThe galaxy colours were calculated using the aperture\nmagnitudes, and the cluster early-type galaxies were again\nselected by their location on the colour-magnitude relation.\nFor consistency, we used the same sigma clipping algorithm\nas described in Section 4 to define the colour-magnitude relations from the SExtractor detections, but obtained very\nsimilar results to those listed in Table 2.\nThe B-band luminosity in solar units of each galaxy\non the colour-magnitude sequence was evaluated using the\n'best' I magnitudes converted to absolute B magnitudes\nby first applying an I-band K-correction for E/S0 galaxies from Rocca-Volmerange & Guiderdoni (1988), and thereafter adding the rest-frame B \u2212I = 2.27 of elliptical galaxies\n(Fukugita, Shimasaku & Ichikawa 1995). The K-corrections\napplied for the three clusters in order of increasing redshift\nwere 0.18, 0.39 and 0.635. We converted to solar B luminosity by adopting MB\u2299 = 5.48.\nThe procedure to compute M/L ratios as a function of\nradius is similar to that described for the \u03b6-statistic; the\nluminosity density within a given aperture is compared to\nthe luminosity density within a control annulus.\n\n\f18\n\nWold et al.\nTable 4.

Kaiser et al. (1998) find that 70 per cent of the total\nexcess light within their cluster apertures comes from earlytype galaxies. They also argue that fairly accurate estimates\nof cluster luminosities can be obtained from the early-type\ncluster population since the noise due to foreground and\nbackground contamination will be greatly reduced. Smail et\nal. (1997a) also point out that using the early-type galaxy\nlight for the M/L ratio makes it easier to compare with other\nclusters since the blue galaxy fraction is known to vary from\ncluster to cluster.\nNevertheless, we also calculated the M/L ratio obtained\nby selecting all galaxies at I < 17. By subtracting off the\nluminosity density in the control annulus, any uniform component will be removed, thereby limiting the contamination\nby field galaxies. In doing this, the galaxies on the colourmagnitude relation were converted to absolute B luminosities as described above, whereas the rest of the galaxies were\nK-corrected assuming an Sa-type galaxy at the cluster redshift and a rest frame colour of B \u2212 I = 1.99 (Fukugita et\nal. 1995). The Sa-type K-corrections we used were, in order\nof increasing cluster redshift, 0.09, 0.22 and 0.38 (RoccaVolmerange & Guiderdoni 1988).\nThe results for the 3C 295 and the E1821+643 clusters\nare shown graphically in Fig. 14. The errors in the M/L ratio were calculated assuming photometric errors of 0.1 mag\nin addition to the previously given errors in the mass. The\nearly-type M/L ratios we find for the two clusters 3C 295 and\nE1821+643 lie typically between \u2248500h and 1000h (M/L)\u2299\nat the different radii, and the M/L ratios which include all\ngalaxies are typically 300-500h (M/L)\u2299 , depending on the\nradius. Smail et al. (1997a) get an early-type M/L ratio in\nV -band of 900h (M/L)\u2299 within 400h\u22121 kpc for the 3C 295\ncluster. Assuming an average colour of B \u2212 V = 0.78 for\nthe galaxies, corresponding to that of an Sab-type galaxy\n(Fukugita et al. 1995), and adopting (B \u2212 V )\u2299 = 0.68, we\nget that Smail et al.'s M/L ratio converts to \u2248 987h (M/L)\u2299\nin B-band. This agrees with our estimate of 2050\u00b11420\n(M/L)\u2299 within the same radius.\nIn the 3C 254 field, we find 39 galaxies with 2.5 < V \u2212\nI < 3.5 within the radius of the outer control annulus. This\nis clearly too few galaxies to obtain a reliable result with\nthe method described above. The M/L ratio for the 3C 254\ncluster is therefore highly uncertain at this point.\nWe note that the M/L ratios we find are moderately\nhigh. The mean early-type M/L ratio obtained by Smail\net al. (1997a) for their ten clusters at z \u2248 0.2\u20130.5 is\n(M/LV )early = 483 \u00b1 103h, and the median is 410h (M/L)\u2299 .\nThis corresponds to \u2248 530h and \u2248 450h in the B-band, so\n\nFigure 14. M/L ratio as a function of radius. Filled symbols\ncorrespond to early-type galaxy light and the open symbols correspond to light from all galaxies having I > 17. The points are\nshifted slightly in the x-direction for clarity.\n\nthe values of \u2248 700h we get are moderately high in comparison. When the whole galaxy population is included, it is\nfound that rich clusters where the early-type fraction is high\nhave M/L ratios of typically \u223c 300\u2013400h (M/LB )\u2299 (Bahcall, Lubin & Dorman 1995; Carlberg et al. 1997; Dahle\net al. 2002, in prep.). Our corresponding number for the\nE1821+643 and the 3C 295 cluster is (M/Lall\nB ) \u223c 500h\n(M/L)\u2299 .\n\n7\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOur results for the 3C 295 cluster are in agreement with\nwhat has been found for this cluster previously, i.e. the cluster is massive and has a high velocity dispersion, and the\nM/L ratio is moderately high. It also shows signs of strong\nlensing at a radius close to the Einstein radius we would predict from our weak lensing measurements, suggesting that\nthere is a large concentration of mass in the core (\u223c 1014 h\u22121\nM\u2299 ) and that the cluster potential is deep.\nThe mass distribution in the E1821+643 cluster is relatively smooth, apart from some asymmetry to the NW. The\n\n\fAGN-selected clusters as revealed by weak lensing\nsame asymmetry is present in the early-type cluster light,\nindicating that the feature in the mass map is real. The\nasymmetry could be caused by a group or a sub-cluster that\nhas fallen in and merged with the main cluster. If this is\nthe case, the merger is probably in a fairly advanced stage\nsince the mass distribution is elongated rather than doublepeaked. One of the cluster members in the direction of the\nasymmetry (41 arcsec N and 15 arcsec W of the quasar) is an\nFRI radio galaxy. Since FRI galaxies are known be central\ncluster galaxies (Longair & Seldner 1979; Prestage & Peacock 1988, 1989; Hill & Lilly 1991), we speculate that a subcluster or a galaxy group associated with the FRI source has\nmerged with the main cluster. Dynamical activity in clusters\nis relatively common, more than 30 per cent of clusters show\nevidence in X-rays of merging (Jones & Forman 1992). The\nsame fraction of activity is also found in weak lensing studies\n(Dahle et al. 2002), suggesting that many clusters are still\nforming by merging of sub-clusters and galaxy groups.\nThe morphology of the mass distribution in the 3C 254\nfield is highly uncertain because the reconstruction is relatively noisy, but it appears to be a very massive cluster with\na high velocity dispersion, \u03c3v \u2248 1200 km s\u22121 . Because of random noise, the position of the mass peak is also uncertain,\nbut the position of the peak in the galaxy light distribution\nis easier to constrain. Galaxies with the expected colours of\nellipticals at the quasar redshift are concentrated in a region 40 arcsec S of the quasar. The I-band image reaches a\ncompleteness limit of I \u2248 23.5, corresponding to \u2248 2 magnitudes fainter than M \u2217 at the quasar redshift, so the image\nshould be deep enough to trace the most massive galaxies\nof the early-type population in a z = 0.734 cluster.\nThe 40 arcsec offset between the quasar and the peak\nin the early-type galaxy light (assuming the colour-selected\ngalaxies lie at the quasar redshift) is not what we expect\nif the quasar sits in a massive cooling flow as suggested by\nCrawford & Vanderriest (1997). A cooling flow cluster is expected to be evolved and have a deep potential well, and\nthe early-type cluster galaxies should be centrally concentrated. It would therefore be interesting to know where the\nmass map peaks in relation to the quasar and the early-type\ngalaxy light, but in our reconstruction, the positional errors\nare too large to address this.\nIs it possible that foreground or background structure\nmay contaminate the morphology and the mass estimate of\nthe cluster in the 3C 254 field? We found in Section 4.1\nwhat appears to be a foreground group or cluster, possibly\nat z \u223c 0.4, but it lies at a large angular distance from the\nquasar and is unlikely to have altered the morphology of the\nmass distribution around the quasar. Also, any background\nstructure at a significantly larger redshift than the quasar\nwould need to have an unrealistically high mass to alter the\nreconstruction.\nThe evidence for an association of the detected mass\nwith the 3C 254 quasar is the following: 1) The mass distribution has a peak which is, within the uncertainties, centered on the quasar, 2) there is significant, extended X-ray\nemission around the quasar (Crawford et al. 1999; Hardcastle & Worrall 1999), 3) the quasar is surrounded by an\nextended emission-line region which signifies gas under high\npressure (Forbes et al. 1990; Crawford & Vanderriest 1997),\nand 4) there is an apparent excess of galaxies around the\nquasar (Bremer 1997). In the rest of the discussion we there-\n\n19\n\nfore assume that the cluster is associated with the quasar,\nbut not necessarily centered on it.\nHow do the clusters we have studied here fit into the\ninteraction/merger scenario and the cooling flow model for\nfuelling AGN in clusters? Both the distribution of mass\nand galaxies in the clusters detected at high signal-to-noise,\nE1821+643 and 3C 295, are fairly smooth, and their velocity dispersions are high. Unless there is sub-cluster merging\nalong the line of sight, this indicates that the clusters are\nevolved and dynamically relaxed. They therefore do not fit\nwell into the scenario where galaxy-galaxy interactions in\ndynamically young clusters fuel the AGN. Also, the moderately high M/L ratios we find seem to argue against this\npicture. One might expect that in a young non-virialized\ncluster, the cluster core would contain a smaller fraction of\nthe total mass since the mass would still not have accumulated there, thus giving a lower M/L ratio than a virialized\ncluster.\nWhereas the 3C 295 cluster is known to contain a cooling flow (Henry & Henriksen 1986; Neumann 1999; Allen et\nal. 2001), it is less certain that the other two clusters have\ncooling flows. So, although we cannot rule out the cooling\nflow model for the clusters, it seems possible that powerful AGN can exist in massive clusters with deep potential\nwells without being powered by cooling flows. E.g. Hall et\nal. (1997) suggested that strong interactions between the\nAGN host and a gas-rich galaxy is the only necessary mechanism for triggering and fuelling AGN in clusters. However,\nas pointed out by Hall et al., this predicts that the AGN\nhosts have disturbed morphology and that the clusters are\ndynamically young.\nIf instead interactions between galaxies can occur in\ndynamically relaxed clusters which have undergone mergers,\nthis could explain our findings. If a merger between two\ngalaxies can push gas into the centre of a galaxy, perhaps a\nmerger between two clusters could result in a whole galaxy\nbeing pushed towards the cluster centre. A cluster merger\nevent could thus disrupt the orbits of some galaxies and send\nthem down into the centre of the potential well where the\nAGN host galaxy sits. If the infalling galaxy is rich in gas,\nit could end up as a source of fuel for the AGN. Even if\nthe dynamical friction is too low and the infalling galaxy\nnever interacts strongly with the AGN host, it could end up\nlosing gas to the host, or at least disturb the gas in the host\ngalaxy itself. This scenario predicts that systems containing\npowerful AGN show a high incident of cluster mergers.\nThe M/L ratios of the clusters studied here seem to be\nmoderately high compared to clusters in general. This could\nmean that they are indeed very massive and have high X-ray\ntemperatures, typical for old clusters where the mass is more\nconcentrated than the light (Bahcall & Comerford 2002).\nAnother interesting possibility is that AGN-selected clusters\nhave systematically higher M/L ratios than purely X-ray or\noptically selected clusters. This might indicate that X-ray\nand optical surveys are biased toward clusters with high\nbaryon-to-dark matter ratios, and could be important to\ncosmology as it may affect estimates of \u03a9 in matter derived\nfrom analysis of known clusters (White et al. 1993).\n\n\f20\n8\n\nWold et al.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAlthough our sample is too small to draw conclusions about\nthe properties of AGN host clusters in general, we can at\nleast point to some interesting facts about clusters hosting\npowerful AGN:\n(i) They can be very massive systems with masses of a\nfew times 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 within the central \u2248 500h\u22121 kpc.\n(ii) They can have very high velocity dispersions of 1000\u2013\n1600 km s\u22121\n(iii) One shows evidence of a cluster merger event\n(E1821+643)\n(iv) Even though the few clusters studied here are consistent with being drawn from the general cluster population, there is some tentative evidence that they tend to have\nhigher M/L ratios than clusters in general\nThe data presented here do not point unambiguously to either the cooling flow model or the young cluster model for\nfuelling powerful AGN in clusters. Points i) and ii) above\nsupport the cooling flow model since cooling flows are expected to occur in dynamically relaxed clusters with deep\npotential wells. On the other hand, point iii) argues against\nthe cooling flow model, and more in favour of the young\ncluster model, although the E1821+643 cluster is clearly relaxed.\nOur study has demonstrated that it is possible to find\nand study massive clusters associated with AGN using weak\nlensing techniques. There seems to be good reasons for expecting moderately rich clusters around the most luminous\nz . 1 radio sources (e.g. Best 2000), and weak lensing observations in these fields might reveal whether they are indeed\nsurrounded by clusters.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank the anonymous referee\nfor a thorough reading of the manuscript, and for valuable\ncomments and suggestions which helped improve the presentation of this paper.
