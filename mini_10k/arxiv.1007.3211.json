The\ncharacterization is valid both in discrete and continuous cases, and also in the case of an infinite\nHilbert space. We show that sharp measurements are clean, i.e. they cannot be irreversibly connected\nto another POVMs via quantum channels and thus they are free from any additional quantum noise.\nWe exhibit an example which demonstrates that this result could also be approximately true for\npure measurements.\nPACS numbers: 03.65.Ta, 03.67.-a\n\nIn the modern formalism of quantum mechanics, measurements are described by positive operator valued measures (POVMs) which have found ample applications in\nvarious areas of quantum physics, ranging from quantum theory of open systems to detection, estimation and\nquantum information theories. POVMs generalize the\ntraditional concept of an 'observable', a selfadjoint operator or a projection valued measure (PVM), which turned\nout to be a too restrictive idealization to efficiently descibe actual experimental settings such as fuzzy position\nand momentum measurements or photon counting and\nphase measurements in quantum optics [1, 2].\nA fundamental problem is to characterize the most precise and informative measurements of a physical quantity.\nOne crucial property of such optimal measurements is\nthe lack of noise; classical or quantum. Therefore, the\npresent letter focuses on the determination of noise-free\nmeasurements. Here we consider two types of noise: classical noise associated with the randomness due to fluctuations in the measuring procedure and quantum noise due\nto the possibility of irreversibly manipulating the state\nbefore a measurement (using a quantum channel).\nSimilarly to quantum states, POVMs form a convex set\nif the measurement outcome space and the Hilbert space\nare fixed. A convex combination aP(X) + (1 \u2212 a)P\u2032 (X),\n0 < a < 1, corresponds to a classical randomization or\nmixing between two (or more) POVMs P and P\u2032 . Such\nmixing is a source of classical noise. Extremal or pure\nPOVMs do not admit any convex decompositions and\nare free from classical noise [1]. For a finite dimensional\nsystem, a simple criterion for extremality can be given\n[3] and Chiribella et al. [4] showed that all pure measurements are concentrated on a finite number of outcomes.\nHowever, in the infinite case, there exist pure (nonsharp)\nPOVMs with continuous measurement outcome spaces\n[5, 6].\nIn this letter, we fully characterize all pure measurements using a diagonalization technique of Hyt\u00f6nen et\nal. [7]. This result is a generalization of the finite dimensional characterization [3]. We also introduce a simple\n\npolynomial method for finding pure POVMs in continuous cases. This method is very useful in many areas\nof quantum physics, e.g. in continuous variable quantum\ninformation.\nFinally, we show that any PVM P can be connected to\nany (P-continuous) POVM P\u2032 via a quantum channel \u03a6\n(i.e. \u03a6\u2217 (P(X)) = P\u2032 (X)), or in other words, P\u2032 is a preprocessing of P [8]. The pre-processing can change the\nPOVM irreversibly, reducing the information from the\nmeasurement. Our result shows that PVMs are clean [9]\nor 'undisturbed' in the sense that they are not irreversibly\nconnected to another POVMs. Thus they do not have\nany additional 'extrinsical' quantum noise [8].\nLet us briefly recall the mathematical description of\nquantum measurements via (normalized) positive operator valued measures (POVMs) [1]. Consider a quantum system with a Hilbert space H and suppose that\nthe measurement outcomes form a set \u03a9. A POVM is a\nfunction P which associates to each (m.) subset X \u2286 \u03a9\na positive operator P(X) acting on H [10]. It is required\nthat for every state (a density matrix) \u033a, the mapping\nX 7\u2192 tr [\u033aP(X)] is a probability distribution. Especially,\nP satisfies the normalization condition P(\u03a9) = I. The\nnumber tr [\u033aP(X)] is the probability of getting a measurement outcome x belonging to X, when the system\nis in the state \u033a and the measurement P is performed.\nA POVM P is a projection valued measure (PVM), or a\nsharp POVM, if P(X)2 = P(X) for all X \u2286 \u03a9. It is easy\nto see that PVMs are pure (see a new proof below).\nH\nFix an orthonormal (ON) basis {en }dim\nn=1 of H, let V\nbe the vector subspace of H consisting of finite linear\n\u00d7\ncombinations of the basis vectors\nP en , and let V be the\nvector space of formal series n cn en , cn \u2208 C.

(Put D = f in Theorem 2.)\n\u2022 RFor any fixed X\n\u2286\n\u03a9, the condition\nh\u03c8\n(x)|D(x)\u03c8\n(x)id\u03bc(x)\n= 0 for all n, m\nn\nm\nX\nimplies that D(x) = 0 for \u03bc-a.a. x \u2208 X. (Replace\nD with \u03c7X D in Theorem 2.)\n\u2022 For any disjoint (m.) sets\nPp X1 , . . . , Xp such that\nP(Xi ) 6= 0 the condition i=1 ci P(Xi ) = 0 implies\nc1 = * * * = cp = 0, i.e., P\neffects P(Xi ) are linearly\nindependent. (Now D = i ci \u03c7X .)\ni\n\nNext we introduce a simple concrete polynomial method\nfor finding pure (continuous) quantum measurements.\nAssume that HP = L2 (\u03a9, \u03bc, Hl ) [16]. Usually in physically relevant 'continuous' cases \u03a9 \u2286 Rp and, by choosing\nsuitable coordinates, \u03a9 is of the form I := I1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Ip\n\n\f3\nwhere Ii \u2286 R is an interval. (Without restricting\ngenerality, we may even assume that any Ii is either\n[\u22121, 1], [0, \u221e) or R.) Moreover, in practice d\u03bc(x) =\nw1 (x1 ) * * * wp (xp )dx1 * * * dxp (where x = (x1 , . . . , xp ) and\nany 'weight function' wi (xi ) > 0 is integrable) and\nan ON basis of L2 (I, \u03bc, H) is {fk11 \u2297 * * * \u2297 fkpp \u2297 en }\n(n = 1, . . . , l) where {fki i } is an ON polynomial basis\nof L2 (Ii , wi (xi )dxi , C) [17]. For simplicity, we assume\nthat n(x) \u2261 1, i.e.. l = 1 and HP \u223c\n= L2 (I, \u03bc, C). Hence\n\u03c8m (x) \u2208 C. Suppose then that any \u03c8m (x) is a polynomial. (Otherwise \u03c8m (x) can be approximated by a polynomial.) From Theorem 2 we get the polynomial method:\nProposition\n1. P is pure if the linear span of\n\b\n\u03c8n (x)\u03c8m (x) n,m contains all polynomials.\n\nProof.\nP is pure if and only if, for any (m.) bounded \u03bb,\nR\n\u03bb(x)\u03c8n (x)\u03c8m (x)d\u03bc(x) = 0 for all n, m implies \u03bb = 0.\n\u03a9\nAssume that lin{\u03c8n (x)\u03c8m (x)}n,m contains all polynomials. Since (any bounded) \u03bb \u2208 L2 (I, \u03bc, C) and the space\nof all polynomials is dense in L2 (I, \u03bc, C) we get the claim\nof the proposition.\nFor example, let Q(X) = \u03c7X , X \u2286 R, be the\nPVM of the canonical position operator (Q\u03c8)(x) =\nx\u03c8(x) of a particle moving on a line. Using Her\u2212x2 /2\nmite functions\nwe can write\nP\u221e hRn (x) = cn Hn (x)e\nQ(X) = m,n=0 X hn (x)hm (x)dx|hn ih hm |. Let Pk :=\nI \u2212 |hk ih hk | be a projection, H = Pk L2 (R, dx, C),\n2\nd\u03bc(x) = e\u2212x dx, and Qk (X) = Pk Q(X)Pk a POVM\nwith vectors \u03c8n (x) = cn Hn (x), n 6= k. If, say, k =\n2 then Q2 is pure by the polynomial method (since\n{Hn (x)Hm (x)}n6=2,m6=2 contains at least one polynomial\nof each degree: H0 (x)Hm (x) is a polynomial of degree\nm 6= 2 and H1 (x)H1 (x) is a polynomial of degree 2). Similarly, using the polynomial method, one easily sees that\nthe measurement of the (quantum optical) Q-function [5]\nand the canonical phase measurement [6] are pure. Next\nwe show that any PVM P can be connected to any (Pcontinuous) POVM P\u2032 via a channel \u03a6 [9].\nLet P and P\u2032 be POVMs with the same outcome space\n\u03a9 but acting possibly different (separable) Hilbert spaces\nH and H\u2032 . Let {e\u2032n } be an ON basis of H\u2032 . Similarly, as\nis the case of P (see Theorem 1), we let \u03bc\u2032 (X), n\u2032 (x),\n\u03c8n\u2032 (x), etc. denote the corresponding maps related to\nP\u2032 . Suppose that there exists a channel \u03a6 such that\n\u03a6\u2217 (P(X)) = P\u2032 (X) for all X. Then, if P(X) = 0 one has\nP\u2032 (X) = 0 so that d\u03bc\u2032 (x) = w(x)d\u03bc(x) where w(x) \u2265 0;\nwe say that P\u2032 p\nis P-continuous. If P\u2032 is P-continuous,\n\u2032\none can absorb\np w(x)\u2032 into functions \u03c8n (x) and redefine\n\u2032\n\u03c8n (x) to be w(x)\u03c8n (x). Hence, without restricting\ngenerality, we may assume that \u03bc\u2032 (X) = \u03bc(X).\nTheorem 3. a) There exists a channel \u03a6 such that\n\u03a6\u2217 (P(X)) = P\u2032 (X) for all X if and only if P\u2032 is Pcontinuous, there exist vectors vns in a (separable) Hilbert\nPdim H\ns\ni = \u03b4nm , and there exspace M such that Rs=1 hvns |vm\nists an isometry W = \u03a9 W (x)d\u03bc(x) from HP\u2032 \u2032 to M\u2297HP\n\nPdim H\nsuch that W (x)\u03c8n\u2032 (x) = s=1 vns \u2297 \u03c8s (x).

However, the\nabove example suggests that this result could also be approximately true for all pure measurements and, hence,\nthe most accurate quantum measurements should be\ndescribed by pure POVMs. The physically significant\nPOVMs usually satisfy certain properties of covariance\nwith respect to a symmetry group of the theory [1]. For\nexample, quantum optical phase measurements are described by POVMs which transform covariantly with respect to phase shifts generated by the number operator.\nHowever, covariant phase POVMs are never sharp. Theorem 2 and Proposition 1 provide powerful tools (i) for\nconstructing pure POVMs descibing 'canonical' (covariant) measurements of physical quantities (phase, time,\nangle, etc.) and (ii) for studying whether (or not) a\nPOVM associated to an actual measurement scheme (e.g.\nhomodyne detection in quantum optics) is pure.\n\nX\n\n[1] A.

Its dual map \u03a6\u2217 (i.e. tr [\u033a\u03a6\u2217 (B)] =\ntr [\u03a6(\u033a)B]) is identity-preserving (unital): \u03a6\u2217 (I) = I.\nPhysically, the condition \u03a6\u2217 P = P\u2032 (i.e. tr [\u033aP\u2032 (X))] =\ntr [\u03a6(\u033a)P(X)]) between POVMs means that to get the\nmeasurement outcome statistics of P\u2032 in the state \u033a one\ncan equally measure P in the state \u03a6(\u033a). A POVM P is\n(pre-processing) clean if, for any (P-continuous) POVM\nP\u2032 and a channel \u03a6\u0303 such that P = \u03a6\u0303\u2217 P\u2032 there exists a\nchannel \u03a6 such that P\u2032 = \u03a6\u2217 P. Hence, a clean POVM\ncannot be obtained by (irreversibly) manipulating the\nstate before the measurement and then measuring some\nother POVM.\n[10] We assume that \u03a9 is an arbitrary set and \u03a3 any \u03c3-algebra\nof (measurable) subsets of \u03a9. Throughout this letter, we\n\n\f5\nkeep \u03a9 and \u03a3 fixed and we implicitly assume that any\nX \u2286 \u03a9 belongs to \u03a3. Usually, in 'continuous' cases, \u03a9 is a\nmanifold and \u03a3 is its Borel \u03c3-algebra. A POVM P is defined on \u03a3 and gets values in the set of positive bounded\noperators on a separable (possibly infinite) Hilbert space\nH. We write briefly (m.) for (measurable). For measurability of (vector valued) maps, see [7], Section 4. Also we\nwrite \u03bc-a.a. for \u03bc-almost all.\n[11] Indeed, \u03bc can be any positive measure such that P is\nabsolutely continuous with respect to \u03bc [7], Remark 3.8.\nIn the discrete case \u03bc is a (weighted) counting measure\nand all integrals reduce to sums. Moreover, V can be\nextended to a Hilbert space H1 and then we have a triplet\nof Hilbert spaces H1 \u2286 H \u2286 H\u22121 [7], Section 6.\n[12] If \u03a9 = R and P is the PVM associated to an operator P =\nP \u2217 then P dk (x) = xdk (x) so that x is an 'eigenvalue' of P\nwith 'multiplicity' n(x) [7].
