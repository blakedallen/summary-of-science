In general, there is\nhowever a high temperature (or low density, pressure,\netc) equilibrium phase where all quantities relax to their\nequilibrium value in finite time. Between the two is the\nputative glass transition, which has been identified as a\ntrue singularity in the free energy in spin glasses or in the\ndynamic free energy in mean field models of glass formers.\nThe main predictions of mean field models concerning the\nglass phase are the existence of an effective temperature\nTef f at which the slowest degrees of freedom are \"thermalized\" and a specific form for the decay of the correlators at long times. Although effective temperatures\nhave been reported in experiments and numerical simulations [2, 3], the time evolution predicted by mean field\nmodels is in general not observed. There is thus still a\ndeep challenge in interpreting the measurements of slow\nrelaxations in the glass phase as well as in describing\nthe crossover between aging and equilibrium dynamics\nwhich take place when one is patient enough to wait for\nthe system to reach equilibrium. Among many interesting\nfeatures of glassy materials, waiting time-temperature superposition (WTTS) has been reported in various glass\nformers [4, 5, 6].\nThe aim of this Letter is, in the context of a mean field\nmodel, to answer the following important questions. Are\nmean field predictions compatible with experimental observations ? Are slow dynamics in the glass phase intrinsically different from slow dynamics in the equilibrium\nphase ? How does the crossover from aging to equilibrium\noccur at the critical point ? What is the origin of the observed WTTS ? The answer to these questions we will\nshed new light on the central role played by the relaxation of the energy.\nThe Letter is organized as follows : we first describe the\nmodel and the old solution of its dynamics, and then improve it with some new results. Next, we establish a correspondence between slow dynamics at equilibrium close\n\nto TM CT and aging dynamics below TM CT , which becomes an exact mapping at TM CT . The consequences of\nthis correspondence, WTTS, interrupted aging and dynamical heterogeneity, are then discussed. Some results\npresented here follow from long and technical derivations,\nwhich will not be given here and will be detailed somewhere else [7].\n\nTHE MEAN FIELD PICTURE OF AGING\n\nWe start discussing the dynamics of the spherical pspin model, where exact statements can be made [1].\nIt can be seen as a ground for establishing rigorous\nresults within the landscape approach following Goldstein [8], and developed by many authors - see [9, 10]\nfor instance. The model consists\nP 2 of N variables Si\nsubject to the\nconstraint\ni Si = N , with HamilP\ntonian H =\ni1 ,*** ,ip Ji1 ,*** ,ip Si1 * * * Sip , where the J's\nare quenched Gaussian random variables. Explicit equations can be written for the dynamics of correlators\nC(t, t0 ) = hSi (t)Si (t0 )i and response functions R(t, t0 ) =\nh\u03b4Si (t)/\u03b4hi (t0 )i to an external field. The solution of these\nequations, which can be found in [1], captures the features of glassy dynamics, where two well separated times\nscale emerge, corresponding to different kinds of degrees\nof freedom, some - \"local\" - responding as in equilibrium,\nand others - \"structural\" - being out of equilibrium. In\nthe equilibrium time sector, fluctuation dissipation theorem (FDT) holds. In the long time aging sector, FDT\ndoes not hold, but instead a modified form of it, where\nthe bath temperature T has to be replaced by an effective\ntemperature Tef f > T which can be computed explicitly.\nA fine analysis shows that slow degrees of freedom are indeed thermalized at Tef f rather than T , coming from the\ncontribution of the structural degrees of freedom to the\nentropy at some energy ET h . The threshold energy ET h\nis the energy separating unstable and stable states, and\ncorresponds to the asymptotic energy : at long times, a\nglassy system is close to marginal stability. In the equili-\n\n\f2\nbrium phase, the energy is Eeq (T ) is above ET h (TM CT ),\nand at the approach of TM CT , the system gets closer to\nthe threshold and slows down, almost trapped by marginally stable states. Similarly, in the glass phase, where\nthe equilibrium energy is below the threshold, the system loses equilibrium when it gets close to ET h (T ) and\nthus ages. In both cases, the closer the system is from\nthe threshold level, the slower it is [11]. Before making\nthis more precise, we briefly recall the known scalings for\nthe correlator C(t, tw ) and the response function R(t, tw ),\nusing as usual \u03c4 = t \u2212 tw , in the equilibrium and glass\nphases [1].\n\nThe old results\n\nIn the equilibrium phase, i.e. T = TM CT + \u000f, there\nare two characteristic time scales, the \u03b2-decay around\nthe plateau and the \u03b1-relaxation [12] : \u03c4\u03b2 (\u000f) = \u000f\u22121/2a\nand \u03c4\u03b1 (\u000f) = \u000f\u2212\u03b3 , \u03b3 = 1/2a + 1/2b, where a and b are\nwell known MCT exponents. \u221aThere, the scalings for C\nare, in order : C(t, tw ) = qc + \u000fc\u03b2 (\u03c4 /\u03c4\u03b2 ) and C(t, tw ) =\nqc c\u03b1 (\u03c4 /\u03c4\u03b1 ), where qc is the non-ergodicity parameter at\nTM CT .\nIn the glass phase T < TM CT , two characteristic time\nsectors have also been identified [1]. The first time sector is stationary : when \u03c4 \u001c tw , there is time translation invariance (TTI) : C(t, tw ) = CST (\u03c4 ) and FDT\nw)\nis still valid : R(t, tw ) = T1 \u2202C(t,t\n. The second - aging \u2202tw\ntime sector corresponds to \u03c4 \u223c tw [15]. There, FDT must\n1 \u2202C(t,tw )\nbe modified : R(t, tw ) = Tef\nand the scaling is\n\u2202tw\nf\nC(t, tw ) = C(h(tw )/h(t)). An interesting but unpleasant\nfeature is that the analysis of the aging equations at infinite tw is not sufficient to determine h(t) [1], which has remained unknown until recently. From this point of view,\nequilibrium and aging dynamics seem to differ strongly.\nWe now improve an analysis made recently of the dynamical equations at large but finite tw [16] and show that\nin fact both phases are very similar.\n\nNew results about the aging regime\n\nRecently, it was shown that for T < TM CT , aging actually sets in around the plateau [16, 17], a time sector\nwhich is usually just considered as the matching point\nof the TTI and aging sectors. It was shown that in this\nregime, the correlators have a scaling form C(t, tw ) =\n\u03b2\nq + t\u2212\u03b1\nw g(\u03c4 /tw ), where the exponents are related through\n\u03b1 = \u03b2a. In addition, matching with the aging regime,\nthe uncertainty on the\u0010function\n\u0011 h(t) was considerably\n1\u2212\u03bc\n\nreduced to h(t) = exp A t1\u2212\u03bc\nwhich can be safely absorbed\nand set to 1, while the aging\n\u03bcb = \u03b1 + b\u03b2 and now a and\n\n, where A is a constant\ninto the relaxation time\nexponent \u03bc \u2264 1 verifies\nb are aging MCT expo-\n\nnents. Remark that \u03bc \u2264 1 is required for this solution\nto be consistent. Situations where this occurs have been\nreported in various experiments, e.g. [18]. Values of \u03bc exceeding 1 (super-aging, see e.g. [19]) are the signature\nof a different relaxation mechanism. After this analysis,\nthe complete solution is still to be found, as the exponents are unknown although all determined by \u03b1. However, interestingly, in the same time the energy was\nshown to relax as E(t) = ET h +E2 t\u22122\u03b1 , meaning that the\nwhole slowness of the correlators is actually encoded in\nthe energy relaxation towards the threshold level. This is\nremarkable and will lead to the striking correspondence\nbetween equilibrium and aging dynamics, which we shall\nestablish below. Last, but not least, the scaling of the res\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b2 0\nponse function is R(t, tw ) = \u2212tw\nw (\u03c4 /t\u03b2w )/T and the\nratio X(y) = w(y)/g(y) interpolates smoothly between\nX(\u2212\u221e) = 1 and X(\u221e) = X = T /Tef f , showing that all\ninteresting features of the aging regime already occur in\nthe plateau regime, which corresponds to the time scales\nwhere motion propagates from local to structural degrees\nof freedom.\n\nAGING IS LIKE EQUILIBRIUM\n\nWe now analyze further and improve these results, in\norder to obtain a unified picture of equilibrium and glass\nphases. First, we recall the simplest of the two equations\nverified by the scaling functions g and w around the plateau [16] (where x0 is such that g(x0 ) = 0) :\nZ x\nw0 (y)g(y)\n= \u03c8(x0 ),\n\u03c8(x) +\ndy\nTef f\nx0\n(1)\nZ x\n2\n0\n\u03c8(x) = w(x) +\ndy w (y) (w(x \u2212 y) \u2212 w(x))\n0\n\nWhen T = TM CT , T = Tef f , and Eq. (1) reduces to the\nequation for the scaling function c\u03b2 of equilibrium dynamics [12]. Second, writing h(t) = exp \u03c6(t), it is easy to\nverify that in order to have C(h(tw )/h(t)) be of order 1,\none needs that \u03c4 \u223c \u03c60 (tw ) = t\u03bcw . This has an important\nconsequence : the scaling C(h(tw )/h(t)) with a stretched\nexponential h(t) is in general very hard to observe except in the p-spin model [17], and in the large tw limit\nit differs only through tiny asymptotic corrections to the\n \u0303 /t\u03bc ). This explains the\nobserved scaling C(t, tw ) = C(\u03c4\nw\nmany reported discrepancies between mean field predictions and measurements [2, 3]. Third, and more strikingly, the aging relaxation can also be related to the scaling\nfunction of the \u03b1-regime in the equilibrium phase, at all\ntemperatures. Indeed, the scaling function C was found\nin [1] to verify\nZ\n\n1\n\nqX\n\u03bb\n\nd\u03bb0\n\nd\nC(\u03bb0 )p\u22121 C\nd\u03bb0\np\u22121\n\n(p \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 q)C(\u03bb) \u2212 C(\u03bb)\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bb\n\u03bb0\n\n\u0013\n=\n\n(1 \u2212 q + qX).\n\n(2)\n\n\f3\nWe now show that the solution of this equation is in\nfact a familiar function of the equilibrium phase. Writing\n\u03bb = exp(\u2212\u03c4 ), one gets, after a bit of algebra :\nD(t) +\n\npqcp\u22121\n2\n2TM\nCT\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4\n\ndt Dp\u22121 (t)D0 (\u03c4 \u2212 t) = 0,\n\n(3)\n\n0\n\nwith D(x) = C(exp(\u2212x)), which is exactly the equation\nverified by c\u03b1 [12, 13]. Using h(t) \u2248 exp (\u03c4 /t\u03bcw ), and remarking that the small \u03c4 behavior must match the \u03b2regime, we can determine unambigously D, leading to :\nC(t, tw ) = qc\u03b1 (\u03c4 /\u03c4\u03b1 (tw )), where \u03c4\u03b1 (tw ) \u221d t\u03bcw .\n\nMapping equilibrium onto aging\n\nThe interpretation of the preceding paragraph will be\ncentral result. We introduce \u000f(T, tw ) = E(tw ) \u2212 ET h (T )\nand obtain for T < TM CT : \u03c4\u03b2 (tw ) = \u000f(T, tw )\u22121/2a and\n\u03c4\u03b1 (tw ) = \u000f(T, tw )\u22121/2a\u22121/2b . Added to the above scalings,\nthis leads us to the conclusion that once temperature and\ntw dependences are expressed in terms of \u000f(T, tw ) only,\nequilibrium and aging dynamics almost map onto each\nother. Almost, because a, b and the scaling functions in\nthe \u03b2-regime explicitly depend on T below TM CT . However, the mapping becomes exact at the transition, and\nis very accurate close to it (see Fig. 1). This is a rather\nunexpected and spectacular result, as it gives a route\nto studying aging dynamics from the knowledge of the\ndeeply supercooled equilibrium phase - calculations in\nboth phases are not intrinsically different. In addition,\nit incorporates in a natural way the WTTS reported in\nexperiments.\n\nInterrupted aging\n\nAn immediate consequence of that is interrupted aging.\nIndeed, the glass transition temperature Tg is where a\nglass former seems to lose equilibrium, but where, with\na bit of patience, it is still possible to have it equilibrate. More precisely, there is a crossover waiting time\ntcross such that for tw < tcross aging occurs, while for\ntw > tcross , the system has reached equilibrium and its\ndynamics is TTI. By definition of Tg , tcross is large. A\nna\u0131\u0308ve guess for the value of tcross would be tcross = \u03c4\u03b1c ,\nthe equilibrium relaxation time. However, this is too\nna\u0131\u0308ve, as this is the time for the system to have visited\nseveral equilibrium states, while tcross is the time where\naging stops and is in principe much smaller. In our model,\nit is possible to compute tcross using the previous analysis, from the following gedanken experiment : quench the\nsystem from T = 2TM CT down to T = TM CT + \u03b5, \u03b5 \u001c T .\nDuring the first stage of the dynamics, the energy is close\nbut not enough to its equilibrium value and thus relaxes\nc\nas a power law : E(tw )\u2212ET h (Td ) \u2248 t\u22122\u03b1\nand the system\nw\n\nages. This ends when the energy reaches its equilibrium\nvalue E(T ), which gives : tcross \u223c |T \u2212TM CT |\u22121/2\u03b1c . This\nleads to the following scaling form for the \u03b1-relaxation\ntime : \u03c4\u03b1 = \u03c4\u03b1Eq\n(T )T (tw /tcross ), where T (x) \u223c x\u03bcc at\nc\nx \u001c 1 and T (\u221e) = 1. Remark that tcross may also be\nexpressed as |T \u2212 TM CT |\u03b3/\u03bcc , that is the exponent is the\nratio of the ones of the relaxation time in both phases,\nwhich gives an easier way to measure it in the MCT regime.\n\nDynamical heterogeneity\n\nUsing the previous results, it is possible to describe\nthe general behavior of correlation functions generally\nused for describing dynamical heterogeneities (DH).\nWe \u0010\nstart with the now widely studied \u03c74 (t, tw\u0011) =\nR\n2\ndy h\u03b4C(x, t, tw )\u03b4C(x + y, t, tw )i \u2212 h\u03b4C(x, t, tw )i ,\nwhere \u03b4C(x, t, tw ) is a local correlator at position x. It is\npossible [7] to extend the field-theoretic approach to \u03c74\nused by Biroli and Bouchaud [20] to the aging regime. It\nresults that \u03c74 (t, tw ) is a sum of ladder diagrams built\nwith the full correlator \u03b4C(x, t, tw ), which time dependence follows that of the previous paragraphs. This has\nseveral immediate consequences. First, all scaling results\ngiven in previous analysis of \u03c74 in the equilibrium phase\ncan be directly applied to the glass phase, provided\nwe replace \u000f by \u000f(T, tw ), providing MCT predictions\nfor DH in he glassy phase. Second, it was reported\nin [21] that, once \u03c74 (t, tw )/max\u03c74 (t, tw ) is plotted versus\n\u03c4\n\n1 \u2212 C(t, tw ), all data - i.e. for all tw 's - collapse onto\na single master curve. This could be obtained from\ngeneral scaling considerations, but interestingly, it comes\nout naturally from the fact that all tw -dependance of\nboth quantities plotted is through \u000f(T, tw ), which gives\nthe natural parameterization of the master curve. In\naddition, close to TM CT , the full master curve should\nco\u0131\u0308ncide with the one of the equilibrium phase. Another\nquantity which has been shown to be interesting above\n)\nTM CT is \u03c7T (\u03c4 ) = \u2202C(\u03c4\n\u2202T , which has been shown to have\nthe same critical behavior as \u03c74 (\u03c4 ), and which is more\neasily accessed experimentally [22]. It is very simple to\ngeneralize this quantity to the glass phase, as \u2202/\u2202T is\nidentical to \u2202/\u2202E, up to the non-singular multiplying\nfactor \u2202E/\u2202T . It is thus natural to generalize \u03c7T to :\n\u03c7w (\u03c4 + tw , tw ) =\n\n\u2202C(\u03c4 + tw , tw )\n.\n\u2202\u000f(T, tw )\n\n(4)\n\nIn the equilibrium phase, \u03c7w (t, tw ) reduces to\n\u03c7T (\u03c4 ), while in the glass phase, it becomes\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121\n\u2202\u000f(T,tw )\n\u2202C(\u03c4 +tw ,tw )\n. This expression makes \u03c7w\n\u2202tw\n\u2202tw\nas easy to measure in experiments as \u03c7T . In Fig. 1, \u03c7w\nat T = TM CT + 10\u22123 and \u03c7T at T = .5 \u2248 TM CT \u2212 0.125,\nwith approximately the same value of \u000f are plotted\n\n\f4\ndepend on temperature, and thus the predictions made\nhere should in general be tested at close temperatures.\nThis would also be of valuable help for determining situations where the energy landscape approach gives a\nqualitatively correct picture. On this prospect, and more\nspeculatively, one may ask whether the effect of activation at low temperature may be also reabsorbed in the\nsame way. It would be also worth coming back to data\nfrom previous experiments, where disagreement with former mean field predictions where found, and reinterpret\nthem using the predictions given in this Letter.\n\nFig. 1: Comparison of \u03c7T (\u03c4 ) above TM CT (straight line) and\n\u03c7w (\u03c4 ) well below TM CT (dashed line), with the same value\nof \u000f. The Curves have been rescaled vertically, as the factor\n\u2202\u000f(T, tw )/\u2202tw occurring in \u03c7w is not known.\n\nversus \u03c4 . Clearly, the peaks of the \u03b1-relaxation co\u0131\u0308ncide\nvery well, while the \u03b2-regime slightly differ, having\ntwo different exponents, respectively a \u2248 0.396 and\na \u2248 0.448. When the same procedure is made at\nT = TM CT for \u03c7w , the curves fall on top of each other.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this Letter, we have shown that, within a mean\nfield model, dynamics in the ideal glass phase are essentially identical to equilibrium dynamics just above the\nglass transition, and that all important features in both\nphases may be absorbed in a single function \u000f(T, tw ),\nwith important physical significance, being the distance\nin energy to threshold states. This is a remarkable result,\nas it opens the door to interpreting the aging data obtained in the glass phase of molecular or collo\u0131\u0308dal glass\nformers. In particular, it provides general scaling laws for\nmultipoint correlation functions - relaxation, dynamical\nheterogeneities - as well as the natural parameterization\nto seek, \u000f(T, tw ), which may alternatively be an enthalpy\ndifference. It also naturally predicts WTTS, which was\nreported in aging measurements [6]. On the conceptual\naspect, it is very unexpected, because it shows that aging\ndynamics is actually very similar from equilibrium dynamics in the deeply supercooled regime, which is rather far from common thinking about aging. But this is\nnot so surprising, and reflects the fact that both in liquid and glass phases, slow dynamics occurs because of\nthe roughness of the energy landscape, which shape does\nnot change qualitatively more than static quantities when\ncrossing the glass transition. Here, several strong predictions have been made, which should be tested in experiments and numerical simulations. Doing so, one must\nkeep in mind that in general, the exponents a and b both\n\nAknowledgements\n\nThis work is supported by the ANR grant DynHet. The\nauthor thanks G. Biroli and J.-P.
