These are the pair annihilation processes A + A \u2192 0\nand A + B \u2192 0. Interest in fluctuation effects on the first reaction process dates back to\nthe seminal work by Smoluchowski [1], and in more recent times at least to Bramson and\nGriffeath [2]; and for the second process fluctuations were first studied by Ovchinnikov and\nZeldovich [3]. The final states of both processes are trivial: All particles (save perhaps a\nsingle one) disappear in the case of A + A \u2192 0, and only the excess number of particles of\nthe initial majority species is left in the case of A + B \u2192 0. The nature of the approach\nto the final state is, however, nontrivial and has been the subject of many investigations.\nThe A + A \u2192 0 problem applies, for example, to domain walls in a one-dimensional\nsystem like in the zero-temperature Ising model [4]. Its asymptotic behavior is the same as\nthat of the diffusion-limited coagulation process A + A \u2192 A [5]. The ensuing asymptotic\ndensity decay \u223c t\u22121/2 has been experimentally observed (in an intermediate time window)\nin the fusion kinetics of laser-induced excitons in quasi one-dimensional N(CH3 )4 MnCl3\n(TMMC) polymer chains [6].\nThe study of the two-species annihilation reaction A + B \u2192 0 was motivated originally\nby the cosmological problem of matter-antimatter annihilation. Ovchinnikov and Zeldovich\n[3], and independently a few years later Toussaint and Wilczek [7], asked whether in such a\nsimple annihilation model it would be possible that locally in space only, say, matter would\nbe left. The answer rapidly turned out to be positive: The A + B \u2192 0 system exhibits the\nphenomenon of species \"segregation\", that is, the emergence of ever growing single-species\ndomains (either A or B). As a result, after a short initial period, annihilation takes place\nonly in \"reaction zones\" where the domains border, and the decay of the total density\nis slowed down markedly. Indeed, a non-classical decay \u223c t\u22123/4 has been experimentally\nconfirmed in three dimensions in a calcium / fluorophore reaction system [8]. The condition\nfor segregation to occur is that the spatial dimension d be less than the critical segregation\ndimension dseg , which in the case of A + B \u2192 0 is equal to dseg = 4. Early work on\nthis two-species problem was done by Kang and Redner [9]; clever heuristic reasoning and\nnumerical work on the spatial structure of the domains is due to Leyvraz and Redner [10];\nand rigorous results were derived by Bramson and Lebowitz [11].\nThe renormalization group approach to the reaction A+A \u2192 0 was pursued by Peliti [5]\nand Lee [12], and to the process A + B \u2192 0 by Lee and Cardy [13], and Oerding [14]. The\nstrong interest in these two reactions has sparked off research on many related reactiondiffusion problems by various techniques. Here we will refer only to general introductions\nand overviews, e.g. Refs. [15]-[27].\nIn 1986 Ben-Avraham and Redner [28], crediting Kang, introduced a q-species pair\nannihilation problem that interpolates between these two models, and hence puts them in a\ncommon perspective. They considered a system of q distinct particle species A1 , A2 , . . ., Aq ,\nall propagating with the same difffusion constant, and reacting according to\nAi + Aj \u2192 0\n\n(1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 q)\n\n(1)\n\nwith a single fixed rate. For q = 2 and q = \u221e this q-species Mutual Annihilation Model\n(q-MAM) reduces to the well-understood paradigmatic cases A + B \u2192 0 and A + A \u2192\n2\n\n\f0, respectively. (For the latter case, note that the probability of identical species to\nmeet becomes vanishingly small in the limit of q \u2192 \u221e; hence any particle encounter will\nlead to a reaction, and the distinction of different species becomes meaningless.) The\ngeneral situation has recently been studied analytically and by Monte Carlo simulations\nin Refs. [29, 30, 31].\nFor equal initial densities of all species the asymptotic decay with time t of the total\nparticle density \u03c1(t) follows a power law \u223c t\u2212\u03b1 . In Table I we summarize the values of\nthe decay exponent \u03b1, known or believed to be exact, as a function of q and of the spatial\ndimension d [29, 30, 31]. We also indicate whether or not the density decay is accompanied\nby particle species segregation. The results for d = 1 and q = 3, 4, . . . are based on the\nexact solution of a modified model argued by the authors of Refs. [29, 31] to be equivalent\nto the one-dimensional q-MAM in the large-time limit.\nq=2\n\nq = 3, 4, . . .\n\nA+B \u21920\nd\u22654\n\nq=\u221e\nA+A\u21920\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1 (log)\n\n1 (log)\n\n2<d<4\nd=2\n\nd/4 (\u2217)\n\n1<d<2\nd=1\n\nd/2\n1/4 (\u2217)\n\n(q \u2212 1)/2q (\u2217)\n\n1/2\n\nTable I. The density exponent \u03b1 of the asymptotic decay law \u03c1(t) \u223c t\u2212\u03b1 for the total partical density in the\nq-species Mutual Annihilation Model, as a function of the number of species q and the spatial dimension d. An\nasterisk (*) indicates that segregation occurs and (log) signifies the appearance of logarithmic corrections at the\nupper critical dimension dc = 2.\n\nThe q-species MAM is characterized by an upper critical dimension dc = 2, below which\nmean-field theory breaks down and renormalization is needed. Physically, in dimensions\nd \u2264 2 the recurrence properties of random walkers lead to depletion zones about each\nsurviving particle, and to particle anticorrelations induced by the annihilation kinetics.\nA systematic renormalization group treatment, wherein the spatial dimension d can be\ntreated as a continuous variable, has only been carried through for the cases q = \u221e\n(equivalent to the reaction A + A \u2192 0) [5], and for q = 2 (the two-species reaction\nA + B \u2192 0) [13, 14], which explains the empty entries in the center of Table I.\nThe derivation of the decay laws listed in Table I relies heavily on the full permutational\nsymmetry of the particle species in the q-MAM. It is therefore natural to ask what happens\nto these asymptotic results when the symmetry is lowered. A case of lower symmetry\noccurs, for example, when the particle species are ordered cyclically and annihilation, with\nrate k1 , is possible only between particles of two neighboring species along the cycle. The\nreaction constants are then given by\n\u0002\n\u0003\nkij = k1 \u03b4(i\u2212j) mod q,1 + \u03b4(i\u2212j) mod q,q\u22121\n(1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 q) .\n(2)\n\nWe will refer to this particular system as the q-species Cyclic Annihilation Model (qCAM). Other examples that display lower than permutational symmetry may easily be\n3\n\n\fconstructed.\nIn this work we develop, within the mean-field framework (i.e., in dimensions d > 2),\na general method for finding the exponent of the total density decay law \u03c1(t) \u223c t\u2212\u03b1 , and\ndetermining whether or not segregation occurs in a q-species model where the reaction\nrates kij lower the full permutational symmetry.\nIn Sec. 2 we present our model, which is fully defined by the q\u00d7q matrix k of annihilation\nrates. In Sec. 3 we study how the particle numbers of the individual species fluctuate\naround their average densities at any given time. In Sec. 4 we show, by comparing the\naverage decay law with the fluctuations around it, how the reactions come to an end in a\nfinite d-dimensional volume Ld , and we determine the particle densities in the final state.\nIn Sec. 5 we treat the full d-dimensional space as built up from blocks of size Ld that do\nnot communicate for times less than the diffusion time, which is of order L2 . This allows\nus to derive our general results concerning the occurrence of segregation and the exponents\nin the density decay law. In Sec. 6 we consider a specific example which, by means of a\nsuitable parameter \u03bb, interpolates between the q-CAM (for \u03bb = 0) and the q-MAM (for\n\u03bb = 1). In Sec. 7 we present Monte Carlo simulations which, although preliminary and\nof limited statistical accuracy, are compatible with our analytical findings. In Sec. 8 we\ncomment on an alternative approach, namely via rate equations with an additional particle\ndiffusion term, before we conclude in Sec. 9.\nOur considerations allow us to answer another question as well: In the two-species\nA + B \u2192 0 system the appearance of segregation is usually explained heuristically through\narguments invoking the local conservation of the difference between the number of A and\nB particles. This conservation law thus seemed to be at the origin of the segregation\nphenomenon. However, the discovery [29] that the one-dimensional MAM exhibits segregation for all q < \u221e, even though it is not subject to any conservation law, cast doubt\nupon this apparent direct link between conservation laws and segregation. This doubt\nwas subsequently reenforced by a heuristic argument according to which the MAM should\nexhibit segregation in the entire region of the q-d plane delimited by 1 < q < 3 and\n2 < d < 4/(q \u2212 1) [31]. (The only weakness of this argument is that the region concerned\nby it does not contain any points with integer \"physical\" q and d, except for q = 2, where\nthe conservation law applies.) This present work clarifies this issue: We show that the\nexistence of a conservation law, although a sufficient condition for segregation in dimensions d < 4, does not constitute a necessary condition: Segregation may in fact occur in\nthe absence of any conservation law.\n\n2\n\nA general pair annihilation system\n\nWe consider a system of q distinct diffusing particle species A1 , A2 , . . . , Aq subject to the\npair annihilation reactions\nkij\n\nAi + Aj \u2212\u2192 0\n\n(1 \u2264 i 6= j \u2264 q) .\n\n(3)\n\nHere the kij = kji represent the reaction rates per unit of density; they are constrained\nonly by the requirements that they be non-negative and that there exist a symmetry\noperation under which all particle species are equivalent. We will set kii = 0, implying\n4\n\n\fthat no self-annihilation is possible. Without loss of generality we may consider the matrix\nk to be irreducible, i.e., the system of reactants cannot be decomposed into mutually\nnoninteracting subsystems. The q-species MAM and the q-species CAM discussed in the\nIntroduction are obtained as special cases when all reaction rates in Eq. (3) are equal and\nwhen they are given by Eq. (2), respectively.\nWe shall therefore proceed to analyze the mean-field behavior of the system (3) for a\ngeneral non-negative traceless symmetric matrix k. Our focus will be on the power law for\nthe density decay, \u03c1(t) \u223c t\u2212\u03b1 , and on the segregation properties of this system. Straightforward scaling analysis tells us that for pair annihilation processes such as considered\nhere, very generally mean-field theory is applicable in spatial dimensions d > dc = 2, and,\nlikely with logarithmic corrections, at the upper critical dimension dc = 2. We shall operate entirely at the mean-field level, and hence our results will concern dimensions d \u2265 2.\nIn our discussion we will briefly touch upon implications for lower dimensions d < 2.\nNote that the system of reactions (3) may be visualized as a graph G with q vertices\nrepresenting the q species, in which bonds carrying weights kij connect the vertices of pairs\nof species that may react with each other. At certain points in our discussion it will be\nconvenient to refer to this graph representation.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nMean-field theory and fluctuations\nAverages\n\nLet the stochastic variable Ni (t) denote the particle number of species Ai present at time\nt in a system of volume Ld , and let ni (t) = hNi (t)i/Ld be the average density of the Ai for\ni = 1, 2, . . . , q. Here h. . .i is an average with respect to (i) the initial distribution of the Ni\nat time t = 0 and (ii) all realizations of thePstochastic time evolution. In order to express\nthe mean-field rate equations dni /dt = \u2212 j kij ni nj in terms of dimensionless variables,\nP\nwe set k0 = j kij (which because of the symmetry between all species is independent of i)\nP\nand n0 = q \u22121 i ni (0). We furthermore define the quantities \u03c1i (t) = ni (t)/n0 , \u03baij = kij /k0 ,\nand \u03c4 = n0 k0 t. The mean-field equations then become\nX\nd\u03c1i\n=\u2212\n\u03baij \u03c1i \u03c1j ,\nd\u03c4\nj\n\n(4)\n\nP\nnow with the normalization\nj \u03baij = 1. If all initial densities ni (0) = n0 and hence\n\u03c1i (0) = 1 for all i, then the solution of Eq. (4) reads\n\u03c1i (\u03c4 ) = \u03c1(\u03c4 ) =\n\n1\n,\n1+\u03c4\n\n(5)\n\nwhich tends to zero as a power law with decay exponent \u03b1 = 1. For unequal initial densities the asymptotic decay will generically be exponential (readily generalized to stretched\nexponential for d \u2264 2 as a consequence of the reaction rate renormalization [9, 11, 27]),\nwith one or several of the species tending toward a positive limit density \u03c1i (\u221e); this case\nwill not be considered any further below.\n\n5\n\n\f3.2\n\nFluctuations\n\nIn principle, the fluctuations around this mean-field average are encoded in the master\nequation for the probability distribution P (N1 , N2 , . . . , Nq ; t),\nX kij \u0002\n\u0003\ndP\n=\n(N\n+1)(N\n+1)\nP\n(.\n.\n.\n,\nN\n+1,\nN\n+1,\n.\n.\n.)\u2212N\nN\nP\n(.\n.\n.\n,\nN\n,\nN\n.\n.\n.)\n.

[28], [33], and [34], and exploiting the rate equations (4) for \u03c1i (\u03c4 ) = \u03c1(\u03c4 ) then yields\na Fokker-Planck equation with time-dependent coefficients,\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202\u03c4 F =\n\u03baij \u03c1(\u2202i + \u2202j )(\u03b3i + \u03b3j ) + 12 \u03c12 (\u2202i + \u2202j )2 F ,\n(9)\n1\u2264i<j\u2264q\n\nwhere \u2202i \u2261 \u2202/\u2202\u03b3i . This equation is valid provided the second term on the r.h.s. of Eq. (7)\nremains much smaller than the first one.\n3.3\n\nEquations for the second moments\n\nFrom the Fokker-Planck equation (9) we may readily deduce equations for the time evolu2\ntion of the averages h\u03b3i i,\nPthe variances h\u03b3i i \u2261 \u0393ii , and the covariances h\u03b3i \u03b3j i \u2261 \u0393ij . Since\ndh\u03b3i i/d\u03c4 = \u2212\u03c1h\u03b3i i \u2212 \u03c1 j \u03baij h\u03b3j i, and given that the h\u03b3i i are zero initially, we see that\nthey vanish for all times. The covariance matrix \u0393 satisfies\nX\nX\nd\u0393ij\n\u03bajl \u0393il .\n(10)\n\u03bail \u0393jl \u2212 \u03c1\n= \u03c12 (\u03baij + \u03b4ij ) \u2212 2\u03c1 \u0393ij \u2212 \u03c1\nd\u03c4\nl\nl\nNow let U be the real unitary matrix with elements U\u03bci that renders \u03ba\u0302 = U\u03baU \u22121 diagonal,\nand denote its eigenvalues by \u03ba\u0302\u03bc . In the same manner, we define \u0393\u0302 = U\u0393U \u22121 . Upon\ntransforming Eq. (10) to these new variables we obtain\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd\u0393\u0302\u03bc\u03bd\n= 1 + 12 (\u03ba\u0302\u03bc + \u03ba\u0302\u03bd ) (\u03c12 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2\u03c1 \u0393\u0302\u03bc\u03bd ) .\nd\u03c4\n6\n\n(11)\n\n\fLet us suppose that the particle numbers initially have independent and identical fluctuations, i.e., \u0393ij (0) = \u03930 \u03b4ij . Then also \u0393\u0302\u03bc\u03bd (0) = \u03930 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd , and it follows from Eq. (11) that\n\u0393\u0302\u03bc\u03bd (\u03c4 ) = 0 for \u03bc 6= \u03bd at all \u03c4 > 0. The remaining equation of interest is\nd\u0393\u0302\u03bc\u03bc\n= (1 + \u03ba\u0302\u03bc )\u03c12 \u2212 2(1 + \u03ba\u0302\u03bc )\u03c1 \u0393\u0302\u03bc\u03bc .\nd\u03c4\n\n(12)\n\nNotice that since \u03c1 depends on time, it is P\nnot useful to scale the time \u03c4 in (12) with the\nfactor 1 + \u03ba\u0302\u03bc . The normalization relation j \u03baij = 1 implies that \u03ba\u03020 \u2261 1 is an eigenvalue\nof \u03ba with eigenvector (1, 1, . . . , 1). By the Perron-Frobenius theorem, and since the \u03ba\u0302\u03bc are\nnecessarily real, we have \u22121 \u2264 \u03ba\u0302\u03bc \u2264 1 for all \u03bc. In case \u03ba\u0302\u03bc = \u22121, the r.h.s. of Eq. (12)\nvanishes and the initial fluctuation \u0393\u0302\u03bc\u03bc does not decay, i.e., an eigenvalue \u22121 signals the\npresence of a conservation law.\n3.4\n\nSolution of the moment equations\n\nThe solution of Eq. (12), except when \u03ba\u0302\u03bc = \u2212 21 , is a sum of two power laws,\n\u0001\n\u0393\u0302\u03bc\u03bc (\u03c4 ) = \u03930 \u2212 K\u03bc (1 + \u03c4 )\u22122(1+\u03ba\u0302\u03bc ) + K\u03bc (1 + \u03c4 )\u22121 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere we have introduced the coefficient K\u03bc = (1+ \u03ba\u0302\u03bc )/(1+2\u03ba\u0302\u03bc ). Note that the amplitude\nof (only) the first term in Eq. (13) depends on the initial fluctuation strength \u03930 . Its\nexponent 2(1 + \u03ba\u0302\u03bc ) varies for the different modes \u03bc, which shows that this problem is\ncharacterized by a spectrum of power laws. The second term in Eq. (13) is just proportional\nto the density \u03c1(\u03c4 ) and hence decays as \u03c4 \u22121 . Therefore, if \u03ba\u0302\u03bc < \u2212 12 , the first term decays\nmore slowly than the second one (and vice versa for \u03ba\u0302\u03bc > \u2212 21 ). When it so happens that\n\u03ba\u03bc = \u2212 21 , then Eq. (13) should be replaced with the special logarithmic solution\n\u0393\u0302\u03bc\u03bc (\u03c4 ) = \u03930 (1 + \u03c4 )\u22121 + 21 (1 + \u03c4 )\u22121 log(1 + \u03c4 ) .\n\n(14)\n\nThe variance of the particle number for species i is given by\nX\nX\nX\nh\u2206Ni2 (t)i = q \u22121\nh\u2206Ni2 (t)i = n0 Ld q \u22121\n\u0393ii (\u03c4 ) = n0 Ld q \u22121\n\u0393\u0302\u03bc\u03bc (\u03c4 ) .\ni\n\ni\n\n(15)\n\n\u03bc\n\nLet us denote the algebraically smallest eigenvalue of \u03ba by \u03ba\u0302m , its degeneracy by cm , and\nthe corresponding value of the coefficient K\u03bc by Km .

We begin by posing the\nquestion whether there exists a characteristic time \u03c4\u2217 (L) = n0 k0 t\u2217 (L) at which the particle\nnumber Ni in the volume Ld displays a root mean-square deviation from the average that\nis of the order of the average itself, i.e.,\nhNi (t\u2217 )i \u2243 h\u2206Ni2 (t\u2217 )i1/2 .\n\n(17)\n\nYet the Fokker-Planck equation (9) was derived under the hypothesis of small fluctuations\n(the second term in Eq. (7) was supposed to small compared to the first one), and hence\n> \u03c4 (L). The issue then is what happens at and beyond this time\nceases to be valid for \u03c4 \u223c\n\u2217\nscale. Fluctuations satisfying (17) indicate that the different particles species have widely\nvarying numbers. As we argued in the Introduction, in this situation the annihilation\nprocesses come to an end epxonentially, on the prevailing time scale, through the successive\nextinction of one or several particle species; this final decay is no longer described by the\nFokker-Planck equation (9). In the finite volume Ld , the final state therefore consists of\na collection of particles that are not subject to pair annihilations anymore. If all \u03baij > 0\nfor i 6= j, then at most a single species can survive. But if some of the rates \u03baij vanish, a\nbroader variety of final states is possible (we shall return to this point in Sec. 6). In any of\nthese cases, whereas initially all species were equivalent, the final state has this symmetry\nbroken. In fact, this symmetry breaking may be traced back to the first term in Eq. (13),\nwhich includes the amplitude \u03930 \u2212 K\u03bc . Thus, this symmetry breaking is enhanced by\ninitial fluctuations, as represented by \u03930 , yet it actually persists even for the case \u03930 = 0,\ni.e. if we initially take all particle numbers Ni (0) to be strictly equal. We shall discuss\nseveral examples of such broken symmetry states in Sec. 6.\nWe turn now to the determination of the characteristic time \u03c4\u2217 (L). Utilizing in Eq. (17)\nthat hNi (t)i \u2243 n0 Ld \u03c4 \u22121 for \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e as well as inserting the asymptotic results of Eqs. (15)\nand (16), and then solving for \u03c4\u2217 (L), we find\n\uf8f1 \u22121\nK n0 Ld\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd\nd\n1\n2n0 L / log(n0 L )\n\u03c4\u2217 (L) \u2243\n\u03ba\u0302m T \u2212 2 , \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e ,\n(18)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u22121\nC (n0 Ld )1/|2\u03ba\u0302m |\nwhere C = [cm q \u22121 (\u03930 \u2212 Km )]1/|2\u03ba\u0302m | . The order of magnitude N\u2217 (L) of the particle number\nfor a surviving species will be N\u2217 (L) \u223c n0 Ld \u03c1(\u03c4\u2217 (L)) \u2243 n0 Ld /\u03c4\u2217 (L), and hence is given by\n\uf8f1\nK\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\nd\n1\nlog(n0 L )\n(19)\n\u03ba\u0302m T \u2212 2 , \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e .\nN\u2217 (L) \u223c\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nC(n0 Ld )1\u22121/|2\u03ba\u0302m |\n\nWhen \u03ba\u0302m > \u2212 12 this surviving number is of order unity, but when \u03ba\u0302m = \u2212 21 it grows\nlogarithmically with the volume; and when \u03ba\u0302m < \u2212 12 it grows with a positive power of L.\n\n8\n\n\f5\n\nSegregation in an infinite volume\n\nWe now consider an infinite volume in which the q annihilating species propagate with\n(uniform) diffusion constant D, and apply a heuristic analysis: We imagine this infinite\nvolume divided into hypercubic subvolumes of size Ld . For times less than the characteris< \u03c4 (L) \u223c L2 /D, the subvolumes can be treated as effectively\ntic diffusion time, i.e., for \u03c4 \u223c\ndiff\nindependent, and hence the results of Eqs. (18) and (19) apply to each of them. We will\ndiscuss the four distinct cases separately.\n(i) Case \u2212 12 < \u03ba\u0302m \u2264 1. From Eq. (19) we infer in this situation that in an isolated volume the particle number fluctuations become of the order of the average itself only at times\nwhen the total particle numbers N\u2217 (L) \u223c K have decreased to order unity themselves. In\nany case, in dimensions d > 2 the time scale at which this happens, \u03c4\u2217 (L) \u223c Ld , is much\nlarger than the diffusion time \u03c4diff (L) \u223c L2 . Hence in an infinite system the subvolumes\nbegin to mix diffusively long before the fluctuations of their particle numbers become of\nthe order of the averages. This is tantamount to stating that for \u03ba\u0302m > \u2212 12 there is no\nparticle segregation.\n(ii) Case \u22121 < \u03ba\u0302m < \u2212 12 . In this case Eq. (18) states that the fluctuations become of\nthe order of the average value \u03c1(\u03c4 ) at a characteristic time \u03c4\u2217 (L) \u223c Ld/|2\u03ba\u0302m | , and in an\nisolated volume the annihilation processes will come to an end on this same time scale.\nSimilarly in an infinite system, subject to the condition that\n\u03c4\u2217 (L) \u226a \u03c4diff (L) ,\n\n(20)\n\neach subvolume of size Ld will reach a quasi-final state, to be referred to as a \"domain\",\nand further reactions are possible only at the \"reaction zones\" separating the domains.\nThe quasi-final state in each subvolume is reached independently of its neighbors, and\nthe emergence of these different disjoint quasi-final states constitutes the phenomenon of\nsegregation into domains. The condition (20) implies that segregation occurs in dimensions\nbelow a critical segregation dimension dseg\ndseg = 4 |\u03ba\u0302m | .\n\n(21)\n\nIt therefore appears that in the present case the critical segregation dimension for diffusionlimited multi-species pair annihilation processes is always constrained by the interval 2 <\ndseg < 4. The dimensionless particle density in a given domain will be of the order \u03c1\u2217 (L) =\nN\u2217 (L)/(n0 Ld ) and cannot decrease further until diffusion between neighboring domains\npermits new reactions to take place. Hence we conclude that at any time \u03c4 the particle\ndensity in an infinite system equals \u03c1\u2217 (Ldiff (t)), where Ldiff (t) \u223c (Dt)1/2 = (D\u03c4 /n0 k0 )1/2 .\nBy combining these relations we find that the density decays asymptotically as\n\u03c1(\u03c4 ) \u223c (C \u2032 \u03c4 )\u2212d/dseg\n\n(2 < d < dseg ) ,\n\n2/d\u22121\n\n(22)\n\nwhere C \u2032 = [cm q \u22121 (\u03930 \u2212 Km )]\u22122/d n0\nD/k0 is a dimensionless constant. Thus we obtain\n\u03b1 \u2261 d/dseg for 2 < d < dseg .\n(iii) Case \u03ba\u0302m = \u2212 12 . In this case dseg = 2, which is also the upper critical dimension dc\nwhere mean-field theory is only marginally applicable. Nevertheless, upon following the\n9\n\n\fsame reasoning as above we find the asymptotic density decay law\n\u03c1(\u03c4 ) \u223c (k0 /2D) \u03c4 \u22121 log(D\u03c4 /k0 )\n\n(d = dseg = dc = 2)\n\n(23)\n\nin two dimensions. Based on renormalization group arguments and Monte Carlo simulations, this result was predicted in particular for the 3-MAM [29, 30, 31], for which indeed\n\u03ba\u0302m = \u2212 21 (see Subsec. 6.1 below). It is remarkable that the logarithmic corrections (23)\ntake the same form as quite generically predicted for pair annihilation reactions in two\ndimensions as consequence of the required reaction rate renormalizations induced by the\nappearance of depletion zones in low dimensions. Although segregation effects are very difficult to capture within the framework of renormalized field theory (compare the discussion\nin Ref. [31]), we therefore hypothesize, but cannot prove, that no additional logarithmic\nfactors beyond those exhibited in Eq. (23) appear in the general case.\n(iv) Case \u03ba\u0302m = \u22121. This special case, for which dseg = 4, occurs when the graph\nG is bipartite, i.e., when it is comprised of two subsets of vertices such that all bonds\nare between vertices of different subsets. Since these subsets are necessarily equivalent\nunder symmetry, this obviously requires that q be even, and we may relabel the sets to\n{1, 2, . . . , q/2} and {q/2 + 1, q/2 + 2, . . . , q}. The particle numbers then obey the local\nconservation law\nq/2\nq\nX\nX\nNi (t) = constant ,\n(24)\nNi (t) \u2212\ni=1\n\ni=q/2+1\n\nand it is readily verified that \u03ba has an eigenvector (1, . . . , 1, \u22121, . . . , \u22121) with eigenvalue\n\u22121. For \u03ba\u0302m = \u22121 we moreover infer from Eq. (13) that \u0393\u0302\u03bc\u03bc (\u03c4 ) = \u03930 , which establishes\nthat as a direct consequence of the conservation law the initial fluctuations in the total\nparticle numbers of the two subsets do not relax. Examples where this happens are the\n2-MAM (the two-species pair annihilation reaction A + B \u2192 0) and the q-CAM with even\nq (see Subsec. 6.2).\n\n6\n\nAn explicit example\n\nWe proceed to investigate a specific q-species pair annihilation system that depends on a\nparameter \u03bb, interpolating for 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1 between the q-CAM and the q-MAM that were\ndefined in the Introduction.\nWe imagine the q species arranged in a cycle. The annihilation rate is set equal to k1\nfor any pair of species that are nearest neighbors along the cycle, and to k2 for any other\npair. Then the ratio \u03bb \u2261 k2 /k1 is the only intervening parameter in the normalized matrix\n\u03ba. Using the abbreviation Nq\u03bb = 1 + 21 (q \u2212 3)\u03bb, one has\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\n\u03baij = \u03bb + (1 \u2212 \u03bb) \u03b4(i\u2212j) mod q,1 + \u03b4(i\u2212j) mod q,q\u22121 / 2Nq\u03bb\n(i 6= j)\n(25)\n\nand \u03baii = 0. For 0 \u2264 \u03bb < 1 this model is symmetric only under cyclic translation of the\nspecies, and the special case \u03bb = 0 yields the q-CAM. For \u03bb = 1 the model displays full\npermutation symmetry and we recover the q-MAM.\n\n10\n\n\fIt is straightforward to diagonalize \u03ba by Fourier transforming in the variable i \u2212 j,\nand hence the mode labels \u03bc, \u03bd, . . . belong to the set of wavenumbers p \u2208 {2\u03c0n/q} with\nn = 0, 1, . . . , q \u2212 1. The corresponding eigenvalues are\nX\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(26)\n\u03ba\u0302p = q \u22121\n\u03baij eip(i\u2212j) = 12 \u03bb(q \u03b4p0 \u2212 1) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb) cos p / Nq\u03bb .\ni,j\n\nWe shall first discuss the two limiting models, the MAM and the CAM, whose segregation\nproperties turn out to be quite different. Next, our study as a function of \u03bb will characterize the crossover between these two cases, thereby shedding light on the nature of the\nsegregation mechanism.\n6.1\n\nMutual Annihilation Model (MAM)\n\nThe parameter value \u03bb = 1 defines the Mutual Annihilation Model (q-MAM). In this case\nthe graph G with q vertices is fully connected and every bond carries the same weight.\nThis model, introduced in Ref. [28], has been extensively studied in Refs. [29, 30, 31]. We\nmay reproduce the known results in dimensions d \u2265 2 as follows. Eq. (26) shows that for\n\u03bb = 1 the matrix \u03ba has a single eigenvalue 1 (namely for the mode with p = 0) and a\n(q \u2212 1)-fold degenerate eigenvalue \u03ba\u0302m = \u22121/(q \u2212 1) (which occurs for all p 6= 0). In the\ntwo-species model with q = 2, this latter eigenvalue equals \u22121, whence we encounter the\nspecial case (iv) of Sec. 5. There is a conservation law, we find dseg = 4, and for d < dseg\nthe density decays as \u03c1(\u03c4 ) \u223c \u03c4 \u2212d/4 [9, 11, 13, 31].\nFor 2 < q < 3, the eigenvalue \u03ba\u0302m = \u22121/(q \u2212 1) lies in the interval [\u22121, \u2212 12 ], whence\nwe are confronted with case (ii) of Sec. 5. According to Eq. (21), there then exists a\nq-dependent segregation dimension\ndseg (q) = 4/(q \u2212 1) ,\n\n(27)\n\na relation first derived in Ref. [31]. Although this case does not encompass any integer\nvalues of q, it does suggest that segregation may occur even in the absence of a conservation\nlaw. Such a scenario will indeed be confirmed below.\nThe marginal value q = 3 corresponds to the special case (iii) of Sec. 5. Indeed, it\nwas concluded in Refs. [29, 31] on the basis of renormalization group arguments that in\ntwo dimensions the total density in the 3-MAM decays as \u03c1(\u03c4 ) \u223c \u03c4 \u22121 log \u03c4 , in agreement\nwith Eq. (23). For q > 3 we obtain dseg (q) < 2, and our present theory is not applicable\nanymore. The analytical and numerical studies reported in Refs. [29, 30, 31] however\nyield species segregation in one dimension, with a q-dependent density decay exponent\n\u03b1(q) = (q \u2212 1)/2q.\n6.2\n\nCyclic Annihilation Model (CAM)\n\nFor \u03bb = 0 the cyclic graph G only contains nearest-neighbor bonds, i.e., a particle of\na given species can annihilate only with particles of one of its two neighboring species.\nThis model has been called the Cyclic Annihilation Model or q-CAM. In this case the\neigenvalues given in Eq. (26) reduce to \u03ba\u0302p = cos p. For even q, the mode with p = \u03c0 yields\n11\n\n\fthe smallest eigenvalue \u03ba\u0302m = \u22121. But for odd q the smallest eigenvalue is acquired for\np = \u03c0(1 \u00b1 q \u22121 ), namely \u03ba\u0302m = \u2212 cos \u03c0q . It then follows from Eq. (21) that\n(\n4\n(q = 2, 4, 6, . . .)\ndseg =\n.\n(28)\n4 cos \u03c0q\n(q = 3, 5, 7, . . .)\nFor q = 2, 3, 4 these results for dseg (q) were previously known, since in these cases the CAM\nactually coincides with a MAM: the 3-CAM coincides with the 3-MAM, and the 2-CAM\nand 4-CAM are both equivalent to the 2-MAM [29, 31]. The first novel case is therefore\nq = 5, for which Eq. (28) gives\n\u221a\ndseg (5) = 1 + 5 = 3.236... .\n(29)\nIt follows that the 5-CAM exhibits segregation in spatial dimensions d = 3 and d = 2, and\nEq. (22) implies that \u03c1(\u03c4 ) \u223c \u03c4 \u2212\u03b1 with\n( 1 \u221a\n(d = 2)\n( 5 \u2212 1) = 0.618...\n2\n(q = 5) .\n(30)\n\u03b1=\n\u221a\n3\n( 5 \u2212 1) = 0.927...\n(d = 3)\n4\n(Curiously, the decay exponent in two dimensions is just the golden mean.) In simulations,\naside from the observation of species segregation, direct measurement of the exponent\nvalues \u03b1 provides a straightforward means to verify the present theory (see Sec. 7 below).\nThe domain structure in the case of the q-CAM needs to be discussed. Whereas the\nMAM is necessarily characterized by single-species domains, this is no longer true for\nthe CAM. Let us first consider q = 5. For the 5-CAM one can certainly conceive the\npossibility of single-species domains. Any given particle species, however, does not react\nwith two other species, and hence is able to coexist with either of those. It appears\nevident, therefore, that a single-species domain is not stable against penetration by either\nof the two species with which its particles cannot annihilate. Thus we must suppose that\na typical segregated domain will always contain two species, say l and l\u2032 , out of the five,\nviz. any of the cyclically equivalent combinations {ll\u2032 } = {13}, {24}, {35}, {41}, {52}.\nThese domains are \"stable against penetration\", in the following sense: Any particle of a\ndifferent species intruding into such a domain would annihilate with at least one of the\ntwo domain species.\nFor q \u2265 6 new questions appear that we will not fully address here. As for q = 5, we\nmay list the subsets of particles that can coexist in a domain where no interactions take\nplace anymore. There are two subsets with three species, {135} and {246}, and three\nsubsets with only two species, namely {14}, {25}, and {36}. All these five subsets are\n\"impenetrable\" to an intruder species. It is therefore an interesting issue which type of\ndomains are going to be formed in the segregation process.\nOne important conclusion from the q-CAM is that for q = 5, 7, . . . we encounter \"physical\" situations (q and d are integers), where, in spite of the absence of a conservation\nlaw, species segregation into domains emerges. Note that the segregation mechanism does\nnot even require initial fluctuations in the species numbers: Even if initially absent, such\nfluctuations are dynamically generated by the annihilation reactions, and they decay more\nslowly than the average particle numbers themselves.\n12\n\n\f6.3\n\nInterpolating model\n\nWe now allow an arbitrary value for \u03bb in the interval [0, 1], i.e., we consider the more\ngeneral interpolating model. For even q, Eq. (26) tells us that the eigenvalue \u03ba\u0302p assumes\nits minimum for p = \u03c0; for odd q one may verify that, just as for \u03bb = 1, it becomes\nminimal for p as close as possible to \u03c0, that is, for p = \u03c0(1 \u00b1 q \u22121 ). Upon substituting these\nminimal eigenvalues in Eq. (21), we obtain\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (4 \u2212 2\u03bb)/Nq\u03bb\nq even\ni\nh\n.\n(31)\ndseg (q) =\n\uf8f3 2\u03bb + 4(1 \u2212 \u03bb) cos \u03c0 / Nq\u03bb q odd\nq\n\nFor \u03bb = 0, 1, this expression reduces to the limiting values found above. It is consistent\nwith our mean-field assumptions only as long as it leads to a dseg (q) \u2265 2. That is easily\nseen to imply that at given \u03bb, it is meaningful only for q below a maximum value qc (\u03bb);\nfor q above that value, there is no segregation in any d \u2265 2.\n\n7\n\nSimulations\n\nWe have performed Monte Carlo simulations in one, two, and three dimensions for the\nq-CAM with q = 2, 3, 4, 5 with the goal to test the theoretical predictions for the decay\nexponent \u03b1. For more particle species, our computing resources unfortunately cannot\nprovide sufficiently reliable data statistics.\nThe simulation algorithm proceeds as described in Ref. [31]: Starting from an initially\nrandom distribution of particles on a d-dimensional (d = 1, 2, 3) hypercubic lattice with\nperiodic boundary conditions, the system is evolved as follows: A particle is randomly\npicked. Next, one of its 2d nearest-neighbor sites is selected randomly; if it is occupied by\na particle of a different species, both particles are removed, otherwise the particle hops to\nthe empty site. The Monte Carlo time is scaled with the total number of particles present\n(asynchronous time update).\nBeginning with the data in three dimensions, obtained from simulations on a 100 \u00d7\n100 \u00d7 100 cubic lattice by averaging over 20 runs with random initial conditions, we plot\nthe effective decay exponent\nd ln \u03c1(t)\n\u03b1(t) = \u2212\n(32)\nd ln t\nin Fig. 1. In d = 3, naturally our statistics is worst, and the data cease to be reliable at\naround t \u2248 600. The results for even and odd q are clearly distinct; and as anticipated,\nthe processes for q = 2 and q = 4 are equivalent. Whereas Eqs. (28) and (22) predict\n\u03b1 = 3/4 asymptotically for q even, the data show that the effective exponent \u03b1(t) rather\nreaches a plateau at \u223c 0.88. As discussed in Ref. [31], one should however expect the\nasymptotic decay law to be somewhat masked by the mean-field behavior \u223c t\u22121 , which\ncould explain the combined effective decay exponent closer to 1. Indeed, we found the\nsame deviation from the asymptotic value 0.75 in our simulations for the 2-MAM (see\nFig. 8 in Ref. [31]). The data for odd q are similarly plagued by crossover effects. For\nq = 3, for which the MAM and CAM are equivalent, we see a slow convergence towards\n13\n\n\f1.3\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\neffective exponent\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\nq=2\nq=3\nq=4\nq=5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n0\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\nt\n\nFigure 1: Effective decay exponent \u03b1(t) for the three-dimensional q-CAM with q = 2, 3, 4, and 5\n(random initial conditions, equal initial particle numbers for each species). The data were obtained on a\n100 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 100 cubic lattice, averaged over 20 runs.\n\n\u03b1 = 1. The data for q = 5 might indicate that \u03b1(t) reaches a plateau at a smaller value,\nin line with the prediction \u03b1 \u2248 0.93 of Eq. (30), but the deteriorating statistics preclude\na definite conclusion.\nOur two-dimensional results, from 20 runs on a 1000 \u00d7 1000 square lattice, are depicted\nin Fig. 2. The data become unreliable at about t \u2248 1000. Once more, the q-CAM for\nq = 2 and q = 4 are seen to be equivalent, with \u03b1(t) settling towards the asymptotic value\n1/2, albeit masked again by the competing mean-field power law, just as for the 2-MAM\n(see Fig. 6 in Ref. [31]). Yet now the runs for q = 3 and q = 5 yield manifestly different\npower laws. In the three-species CAM, the effective exponent is still changing in the time\nwindow accessible to our simulations, running towards \u03b1 = 1, perhaps with logarithmic\ncorrections as predicted by Eq. (23). For q = 5, however, we find a plateau value \u223c 0.71,\nperhaps with a slowly decreasing tendency. This may be interpreted as a combination of\nthe predicted asymptotic decay law (30) with the mean-field result \u223c t\u22121 .\nThe simulation data in d = 1, from averaging over again 20 runs on 105 lattice sites,\nare reliable at least up to t \u2248 104 , and again confirm the equivalence of the q-CAM\nwith even q. For both q = 2 and q = 4 we obtain a slow but definite approach towards\nthe predicted \u03b1 = 1/4, as for the 2-MAM (see Fig. 2 in Ref. [31]). For the 3-CAM,\nequivalent to the 3-MAM, we find the expected slow convergence towards \u03b1 = 1/3 from\nabove [29, 30, 31]. Remarkably, the data for q = 5, for which no analytical prediction\nis available in one dimension, appear to reach \u03b1(t) \u2248 0.33 as well, but faster and from\nbelow. This is remarkably close to what Eq. (22) would predict if we applied it (without\njustification) in dimension d = 1, namely \u03b1 = 1/dseg (5) = 0.309..., with the segregation\n14\n\n\f1.1\nq=2\nq=3\nq=4\nq=5\n\n1\n\neffective exponent\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n0\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10\n\n10\n\nt\n\nFigure 2: Effective decay exponent \u03b1(t) for the two-dimensional q-CAM with q = 2, 3, 4, and 5 (random\ninitial conditions, equal initial particle numbers for each species).

(29).\nIn summary, our simulation results for the q-CAM, within the accuracy and statistical\nerrors of our data, are consistent with the analytical predictions of the previous sections,\nif we allow for crossover effects induced by the presence of the competing mean-field decay\nlaw. The equivalence of the 4-CAM and 2-CAM, which are both identical to the 2-MAM\n(A+B \u2192 0), is clearly demonstrated. Since the 3-CAM and 3-MAM are identical, only our\ndata for q = 5 yield novel results. Unambiguous identification of the density exponents \u03b1\nwould ideally require better statistics, that is, simulations on considerably larger systems.\n\n8\n\nDifferential equation approach\n\nBefore concluding we wish to make a methodological remark. One may attempt to address\nthe issue of segregation by considering space-dependent particle densities \u03c1i (x, \u03c4 ) that\nsatisfy the reaction-diffusion equations (with diffusivity D)\nX\n\u2202\u03c1i (x, \u03c4 )\n= D\u2206\u03c1i \u2212\n\u03baij \u03c1i \u03c1j .\n\u2202\u03c4\nj\n\n(33)\n\nFor spatially uniform (well-mixed) systems these reduce to the ordinary differential equations (4). Let us now apply to the system (33) what is essentially a linear stability analysis.\nTo this end, we write \u03c1i (x, \u03c4 ) = \u03c1(\u03c4 )[1 + \u01ebi (x, \u03c4 )] and linearize with respect to the\nperturbations \u01ebi . With Eqs. (4) this yields\nX\n\u2202\u01ebi (x, \u03c4 )\n= D\u2206\u01ebi (x, \u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03c1(\u03c4 )\n\u03baij \u01ebj ,\n\u2202\u03c4\nj\n\n(34)\n\nwhere the neglected nonlinear terms are of order \u03c1 \u01eb2 . In terms of the linearly transformed\nvariables\nZ\nX\n\u01eb\u0302\u03bc (p, \u03c4 ) =\nU\u03bcj dd x eip*x \u01ebj (x, \u03c4 )\n(35)\nj\n\nwith U as defined in Subsec. 3.3, the time evolution equation (34) becomes diagonal and\nreads\nd\u01eb\u0302\u03bc (p, \u03c4 )\n= \u2212[Dp2 + \u03c1(\u03c4 )\u03ba\u0302\u03bc ] \u01eb\u03bc (p, \u03c4 ) .\n(36)\nd\u03c4\nFor given initial \u01eb\u0302\u03bc (p, 0) this is solved by\n\u01eb\u0302\u03bc (p, \u03c4 ) = \u01eb\u0302\u03bc (p, 0) (1 + \u03c4 )\u2212\u03ba\u0302\u03bc e\u2212Dp\n\n2\u03c4\n\n.\n\n(37)\n\nIrrespective of the value of \u03ba\u0302\u03bc this solution exists and tends to zero as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. Nevertheless,\nfor \u03ba\u0302\u03bc < \u2212Dp2 it will increase initially. In the event that |\u01eb\u0302\u03bc | grows with time such as to\nbe no longer negligible with respect to unity at some instant of time, this signals that the\nneglected nonlinear terms in the differential equation begin to play a role; in particular,\nthey will prevent \u01ebi from decreasing beyond \u22121 and hence \u03c1i from turning negative. We\nwill argue, however, that in this case the physical justification for the differential equations\n(33) breaks down, and that in fact segregation sets in.\n16\n\n\fThis goal requires going beyond the mathematics and invoking the interpretation of\nthe density as an average over discrete particles. For particles initially randomly and\nuniformly distributed in a volume Ld , we typically have that \u01eb\u0302\u03bc (p, 0) \u223c L\u2212d/2 . If this initial\nfluctuation is negative, and if in the course of time \u01eb\u0302\u03bc (p, \u03c4 ) approaches \u22121, this should\nbe interpreted properly as there being an appreciable probability for species extinction.\nA necessary condition for the r.h.s. of Eq. (37) to become of order unity reads explicitly\nL\u2212d/2 (1 + \u03c4 )\u2212\u03ba\u0302\u03bc & 1, or, since \u03ba\u0302\u03bc must be negative, \u03c4 & \u03c4L \u2261 Ld/|2\u03ba\u0302\u03bc | . But on these\ntime scales Dp2 \u03c4 must still be much less than unity. Taking the smallest allowed valued\nfor p in the volume Ld , that is, pL \u223c 2\u03c0/L, the additional condition DpL \u03c4L \u226a 1 yields\nLd/|2\u03ba\u0302\u03bc |\u22122 \u226a 1, which will happen when d < 4|\u03ba\u0302\u03bc |.\nHence the differential equation approach, combined with appropriate considerations in\nwhich the particle discreteness intervenes, leads to the identical expression for the critical\nsegregation dimension as found in Eq. (21) of Sec. 5. The differential equation approach\nwas followed, essentially, in Ref. [31]. To our opinion, however, the Fokker-Planck method\nused in Refs. [28, 33] and in the present work is preferable, since it is based directly on\nthe more fundamental description of an interacting many-body problem in terms of a\nmaster equation. More specifically, the stochasticity taken into account in the differential\nequation approach is due only to the random fluctuations present in the initial state. As a\nconsequence, this approach wrongly suggests that the initially dominant species (or, more\nprecisely, their initially dominant mode \u03bc) is also the surviving one.\nIt follows from the Fokker-Planck equation that there is actually an interplay between\ninitial and dynamically generated fluctuations, brought out by the solution (13) of the\nsecond moment equations. This solution contains a dynamically generated contribution to\nthe fluctuations (viz. the terms \u221d K\u03bc ), and a contribution due to the initial fluctuations\n(the \u03930 term). In systems without segregation (i.e., when \u03ba\u0302\u03bc \u2265 \u2212 21 ) the dynamically\ngenerated fluctuations become larger than those due to the initial conditions, which are\neventually forgotten. In systems with segregation (for \u03ba\u0302\u03bc < \u2212 21 ) the initial and dynamical\ncontributions are of the same order and the initial conditions co-determine the final state.\nIn this weaker sense, the segregation phenomenon that appears in the cases with \u03ba\u0302\u03bc < \u2212 21\nis still linked to the persistence of initial fluctuations, even in the absence of conservation\nlaws.\n\n9\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have studied a wide class of q-species reaction-diffusion systems with pair annihilation\nprocesses between distinct species. This class includes the two well-studied paradigmatic\ncases A + A \u2192 0 (in the limit q \u2192 \u221e) and A + B \u2192 0 (q = 2). Within mean-field\ntheory, i.e. for spatial dimensions d \u2265 2, we have determined for each member of the class\n(i) whether or not segregation occurs, and (ii) the value of the decay exponent \u03b1 in the\nasymptotic power law for the total particle density. Our findings represent a considerable\nextension of previous work on segregation in diffusion-limited annihilation reactions. Our\npreliminary simulation data are compatible with the analytical results.\nOur method builds on ideas that were applied earlier in the context of q-species models\nby Ben-Avraham and Redner [28], and more recently also by Ben-Naim and Krapivsky\n17\n\n\f[33] and Newman and McKane [34]. This approach is obviously not limited to the special\ncases studied here, but we have not aimed at being exhaustive. It is straightforward, for\nexample, to drop the restriction of no self-annihilation (kii = 0), and redo the analysis.\nThe method may also be employed to analyze more involved situations, such as models\nwith species belonging to two distinct equivalence classes.\nVarious open problems remain, in particular concerning the nature of the domain structure in several important cases. Furthermore, the theory presented here is unable to address the issue of what happens in low dimensions, d < 2, where particle anticorrelations\nbecome manifest and render the mean-field treatment invalid. We expect that more elaborate simulations will be carried out in the future to test our predictions as well as to study\nquestions beyond reach of the present theory.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation, Division\nof Materials Research, under Grant No. DMR-0308548.
