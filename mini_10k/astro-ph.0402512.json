We\naddress consequences of evolving dark energy for the fate of the Universe.\nsubject headings: galaxies: distances and redshifts - cosmology: observations -\ncosmology: distance scale - supernovae: general\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nObservations of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at redshift z < 1 provide startling and\npuzzling evidence that the expansion of the Universe at the present time appears to be\naccelerating, behavior attributed to \"dark energy\" with negative pressure (Riess et al. 1998;\nPerlmutter et al. 1999; for reviews, see Riess 2000; Filippenko 2001, 2004; Leibundgut\n2001). Direct evidence comes from the apparent faintness of SNe Ia at z \u2248 0.5.. Recently\nexpanded samples of SNe Ia have reinforced the statistical significance of this result (Knop\net al. 2003) while others have also extended the SN Ia sample to z \u2248 1 (Tonry et al.\n2003; Barris et al. 2004). Observations of large-scale structure (LSS), when combined with\nmeasurements of the characteristic angular size of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB), provide independent (though indirect) evidence for a dark-energy\ncomponent (e.g., Spergel et al. 2003). An independent, albeit more tentative investigation\nvia the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect also provides evidence for dark energy (Scranton\net al. 2003). The magnitude of the observed acceleration was not anticipated by theory\nand continues to defy a post facto explanation. Candidates for the dark energy include\nEinstein's cosmological constant \u039b (with a phenomenally small value), evolving scalar\nfields (modern cousins of the inflation field; Caldwell, Dav\u00e9, & Steinhardt 1998; Peebles\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n& Ratra 2002), and a weakening of gravity in our 3 + 1 dimensions by leaking into the\nhigher dimensions required in string theories (Deffayet, Dvali, & Gabadadze 2002). These\nexplanations bear so greatly on fundamental physics that observers have been stimulated\nto make extraordinary efforts to confirm the initial results on dark energy, test possible\nsources of error, and extend our empirical knowledge of this newly discovered component of\nthe Universe.\nAstrophysical effects could imitate the direct evidence from SNe Ia for an accelerating\nUniverse. A pervasive screen of grey dust could dim SNe Ia with little telltale reddening\n(Aguirre 1999a,b). Luminosity evolution could corrupt the measurements if SNe Ia at\nz \u2248 0.5 are intrinsically fainter than their low-redshift counterparts. To date, no evidence\nfor an astrophysical origin of the apparent faintness of SNe Ia has been found (Riess 2000;\nCoil et al. 2001; Leibundgut 2001; Sullivan et al. 2003). However, given the significance\nof the putative dark energy and the unique ability of SNe Ia to illuminate it, we need a\nmore definitive test of the hypothesis that supernovae at z \u223c 0.5 are intrinsically dimmer,\nor dimmed by absorption.\nIf cosmic acceleration is the reason why SNe Ia are dimmer at z \u223c 0.5, then we expect\ncosmic deceleration at z > 1 to reverse the sign of the observed effect. The combination of\nrecent acceleration and past deceleration is a clear signature of a mixed dark-matter and\ndark-energy Universe and one which is readily distinguishable from simple astrophysical\ndimming (Filippenko & Riess 2001).\nFurthermore, assuming SNe Ia at z > 1 continue to trace the cosmological world\nmodel, measurements of SNe Ia in the next redshift octave provide the unique ability to\ndiscriminate between a static and evolving dark-energy equation of state. This would\nprovide a vital clue to distinguish a cosmological constant from other forms of dark energy\nthat change with time.\nGround-based efforts to look for past deceleration with SNe Ia have offered hints of\nthe effect, but ultimately they have suffered from insufficient signal-to-noise ratios (Tonry\net al. 2003; Barris et al. 2004). Discovering, confirming, and then monitoring transients\nat I \u2248 25 mag on the bright sky is challenging even with the largest telescopes and the\nbest conditions. A single SN Ia at z \u2248 1.7, SN 1997ff, discovered with WFPC2 on the\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) (Gilliland, Nugent, & Phillips 1999), provided a hint of past\ndeceleration; however, inferences drawn from a single SN Ia, while plausible, are not robust\n(Riess et al. 2001; Ben\u0131\u0301tez et al. 2002; Mortsell, Gunnarsson, & Goobar 2001).\nTo study the early expansion history of the Universe, we initiated the first systematic,\nspace-based search and follow-up effort to collect SNe Ia at z > 1, carried out in conjunction\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nwith the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) Treasury program (Giavalisco\net al. 2003) conducted with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard HST. (The\nability to detect SNe at z > 1 with the Space Telescope was an application first envisioned\nduring its planning; Tammann 1977, Colgate 1979). A separate \"piggyback\" program was\nutilized to obtain target of opportunity (ToO) follow-up HST observations of the SNe Ia\nwith ACS and NICMOS (the Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrograph).\nElsewhere we present a color-based method for discrimination of SNe Ia at z > 1 from other\ntransients (Riess et al. 2003) and the full harvest of the SN survey (Strolger et al. 2004).\nWe present the follow-up spectroscopy and photometry of 16 SNe Ia in \u00a72, light-curve\nanalysis in \u00a73, cosmological tests and constraints in \u00a74, and a discussion and summary in\n\u00a75 and \u00a76, respectively.\n\n2.\n\nTarget of Opportunity Follow-up: Light Curves and Spectra\n2.1.\n\nFollow-up\n\nThe methods and criteria we used to search the GOODS ACS Treasury data for SNe\nare described by Strolger et al. (2004) and are based on image subtraction (Perlmutter\net al. 1997; Schmidt et al. 1998). Strolger et al. (2004) provide the parameters of the\nsearch including search depth, efficiency, timing, and false-positive discrimination, as well\nas a list of all detected SNe. Briefly, our search was conducted in the F 850LP (Z-band)\nto an effective limit of \u223c26.0 (Vega) magnitude covering 0.1 square degree in 5 epochs (at\nintervals of \u223c45 days). Our limiting magnitude was 1 to 2 mag fainter than the expected\npeak of a SN Ia over the target range of 1 < z < 1.6, therefore SNe Ia we collected (whose\nintrinsic dispersion is expected to be < 0.2 mag)would not preferentially be selected from\nthe bright tail of their intrinsic distribution. In Table 1 we provide discovery data for the\nSNe Ia reported here.\nOur ToO candidates were generally too faint to anticipate useful spectral discrimination\nfrom the ground; it was therefore necessary to initially identify SNe Ia photometrically. To\ndiscriminate SNe Ia at z > 1 from SNe II and from SNe I at lower redshifts, we used a\ncombination of photometric redshifts of the host galaxies (with 9 passbands) and rest-frame\nultraviolet (UV) colors; see Riess et al. (2003) for details. A comparison of the photometric\nredshifts available at the start of the survey with spectroscopic redshifts obtained thereafter\nyields an RMS of 0.05 for the quantity (zphot \u2212 zspec )/(1 + zspec ) for 25 hosts (with a 4 \u03c3\noutlier; see Strolger et al. 2004).\nWe selected 9 individual candidates for subsequent ToO observations (including one\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\npair of targets observed within the same ACS field). In addition to these primary targets,\njudicious positioning of the follow-up fields provided serendipitous monitoring of 4 additional\nhigh-redshift SN Ia candidates. For 4 more SNe Ia, the periodic imaging of the GOODS\nsurvey (sometimes augmented with a few ground-based observations) provided sufficient\ncharacterization of their light curves. Subsections of the discovery and pre-discovery images,\nas well as their difference (centered on each SN Ia), are shown in Figure 1.\nThe great benefit of HST observations\u2013dramatically reduced sky noise\u2013is only fully\nrealized if operational constraints can be overcome. To get the full advantage of HST, the\nsupernova search needs to be completed, the best targets selected, spectra taken, and the\nphotometric follow-up set in motion in 2 weeks. Otherwise, the peak of the light curve will\nbe missed, the decline rate of the object will not be well measured, and, as the objects\nfade, the spectra will become too difficult to obtain. Our challenge was to do all this\nwithout using highly disruptive and inefficient \"24 hour\" ToOs (for which the HST weekly\nschedule is immediately interrupted, wasting precious observing time). To achieve our\ngoals, each GOODS epoch was scheduled during a 3\u20134 day interval immediately preceding\nthe weekly deadline for a ToO activation. This allowed the ToO observing to be scheduled\nand uploaded to the spacecraft for the following week's observations without delay. By\nadopting this prescription we were able to achieve a time interval of typically 9 to 11 days\nbetween the discovery and first follow-up observation, a span of less than 5 days in the rest\nframe of a SN at z >\n\u223c 1.\nAfter discovery and photometric screening, we developed a follow-up plan which was\nappropriate for our best estimate of the SN redshift. ACS and the F 850LP filter were\ntypically used for 6\u20138 epochs to obtain a rest-frame B-band or U-band light curve for\nSNe Ia at z > 1 extending to \u223c 20 rest-frame days past maximum brightness. This strategy\nutilized results from Jha, Riess, & Kirshner (2004a), who demonstrated the utility of a large\nsample of U-band light curves for constraining the light-curve shape parameter and phasing\nof the optical light curves. To provide rest-frame optical zero-points, where SNe Ia are best\ncalibrated, we used NICMOS Camera 2. SNe expected to be at 1.0 < z < 1.3 were imaged\nwith NICMOS Camera 2 and F 110W . SNe expected to be at z > 1.3 were imaged with\nboth F 110W and F 160W . The one exception was SN 2002ki, for which a ground-based\nspectrum yielded z = 1.14 from narrow, host-galaxy [O II] emission, and F 160W was used\nto sample the second maximum in the rest-frame infrared (IR) to use as a secondary means\nof classification.\nACS coupled with a grism filter (G800L) provides slitless spectroscopy over the entire\nwide-field camera (WFC) field-of-view. For obtaining spectra of high-redshift SNe Ia,\nthis mode of observing has noteworthy advantages and disadvantages as compared to\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nspatial-blocking spectroscopy with STIS on HST or from the ground with a large-aperture\ntelescope. The primary advantage of ACS grism spectroscopy is its efficiency. ACS is\nthe most efficient camera to fly on HST due to its rationed, silver-coated reflections.\nImportantly, slitless spectroscopy with the grism retains the efficiency of HST resolution\nalong one spatial direction, dispersing the light of a point-spread function (PSF) over few\nsky pixels. Another advantage attuned to identifying high-redshift SNe Ia is the relatively\nlow sky brightness between 0.8 \u03bcm and 1 \u03bcm from the vantage point of HST.\nUsing the HST grism has disadvantages as well. HST is a factor of 3\u20134 smaller in size\nthan the largest ground-based optical telescopes. Moreover, the grism disperses a large\nspectral range of the sky onto the position of the SN. For G800L, wavelengths shorter than\n\u223c5500 \u00c5 are blocked so the total sky counts are only \u223c50% greater (hence \u223c25% more\nnoise) than for the I-band (F 814W ). A more troublesome feature of grism observations is\nthe superposition of multiple sources from multiple diffraction orders on the same sky pixels.\nCareful consideration must be given to possible contamination of a SN spectrum by nearby\nsources, especially the host galaxy (although this effect can be mitigated by judicious choice\nof the telescope roll angle). The ACS grism also is limited in resolution to R = \u03bb/\u2206\u03bb = 200.\nHowever, this resolution is well-matched to measure SNe Ia whose blended absorption\nfeatures are broadened by ejecta dispersions of 104 km s\u22121 . Serendipitous spectra of SNe Ia\nobtained during ACS commissioning and reported by Blakeslee et al. (2003) provided the\nfirst in-orbit examples at high redshift (specifically, SN 2002dc at z = 0.47 and SN 2002dd\nat z = 0.95).\nWe employed the ACS grism for our ToOs when we expected to obtain a sufficient\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for classification and redshift determination in fewer than 8 orbits\nof integration time and without detrimental contamination. These included SNe 2002fw,\n2003az, 2003dy, 2003es, and 2003eq as well as the neighboring SN 2003eb. Spectra of other\nSNe or host galaxies were obtained with ground-based telescopes (Table 3), including the\nVLT, Magellan, Keck-II with NIRSPEC (McLean et al. 1998), and especially Keck-I with\nLRIS (Oke et al. 1995).\n\n2.2.\n\nPhotometry\n\nAfter the search phase, all images were reprocessed using up-to-date reference files\nand the CALACS pipeline in the STSDAS package in IRAF8 .

Due to the significant geometric distortion of the ACS WFC (the cost of\nminimizing reflections), we applied the drizzle algorithm (Fruchter & Hook 1997) in the\nMultidrizzle software package (Koekemoer et al. 2004). Because ACS WFC images are\nundersampled at wavelengths shortward of 11,000 \u00c5, a better sampled and more precise SN\nPSF can be obtained by \"drizzling\" (i.e., resampling and combining) the images at a pixel\nscale finer than the physical ACS WFC size of 0.05\u2032\u2032 pixel\u22121 . However, such improvements\ncan only be realized with well-dithered images. The relative size of the dither was measured\nfor each frame using source catalogs. Nearly all of the F 850LP images in the survey and its\nfollow-up were obtained at 4 independent dither positions and were subsequently resampled\nto 0.033\u2032\u2032 pixel\u22121 . Imaging in F 775W and F 606W utilized only 2 dither points and the\nphysical pixel scale was maintained.\nFor NICMOS reductions the CALNICA pipeline in the STSDAS package in IRAF was\nused to provide calibrated frames. Then the well-dithered frames were drizzled to half the\nphysical pixel scale of Camera 2, i.e., 0.038\u2032\u2032 pixel\u22121 . The size of each frame's dither was\ndetermined by cross-correlation of common sources.\nThe phasing of GOODS (spanning more than 200 days) provided additional observations\nof the host galaxies with negligible SN light to serve as subtraction templates for the ACS\ndata. Subsequent light-curve fitting was used to estimate the expected brightness of the SN\nat the time of each GOODS epoch. Epochs with negligible contamination from SN light\nwere combined to obtain deep subtraction templates. By the last epoch of GOODS, SNe\ndiscovered in the first search had faded sufficiently (\u223c2 months past maximum and 3 to 4\nmag below peak) to provide useful templates. For SNe found in all subsequent searches, the\ninitial survey epochs provided the components of deep templates.\nDue to the remarkable stability of rectified ACS images it was generally not necessary\nto \"blur\" (i.e., convolve) images to match the PSFs at different epochs (a conclusion\nreached by fixed-aperture tests on field stars in successive epochs). Subtractions free from\nhost contamination were obtained by flux-conserving registration of the templates to the\nfollow-up frames. The two exceptions were SN 2002hp and SN2003lv which resided < 0.05\u2032\u2032\nfrom the sharp nucleus of bright elliptical hosts and for which the technique of matching\nPSFs was used (Alard & Lupton 1998).\nFor NICMOS imaging, the necessity of obtaining \"clean\" subtraction templates was\njudged for each object based on the complexity of the SN site in the bluer, F 850LP\ntemplates. We judged late-time templates were needed and were obtained for SN 2002hp,\nScience Foundation.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nSN 2002ki, and SN 2003az. As with the ACS data, only SN 2002hp necessitated image\nconvolution to match the PSF before subtraction.\nThe magnitudes of the SNe in the ACS images were calculated by fitting a PSF\nproduced using bright comparison stars scaled to match the infinite-aperture zero-points\nof Sirianni et al. (2004). All ACS passband magnitudes are given as Vega-normalized\nmagnitudes. Residual \"sky\" flux was measured using annuli centered on the SN and with\nan inner and outer radius of 0.66\u2032\u2032 and 1.00\u2032\u2032 , respectively. The center of the PSF fit was\ndetermined from a centroid of a stack of all SN images.\nGilliland & Riess (2002) have shown that the encircled energy of red stars in the IR is\nmore dispersed than for blue stars, likely due to backside scattering from the ACS WFC\nCCD mounting. This is an important effect for images in F 850LP with SNe Ia at z > 0.8\nwhich are considerably red (i \u2212 z \u2248 1 mag) and can be expected to suffer the \"red halo\"\neffect. To measure the SNe Ia in these images, we used a few bright, red (i \u2212 z = 1.0 mag)\nfield stars as a PSF template.\nStatistical uncertainties for the SN magnitudes were determined by adding and\nrecovering artificial PSFs with the measured SN flux (Schmidt et al. 1998). Additional\nuncertainty was included for the shot noise of the measured SN flux. We found excellent\nagreement between the uncertainties calculated empirically and synthetically from the\nSTScI exposure-time calculator.\nNICMOS measurements of supernovae were similar, except out model PSF and\nzero-points were calculated from observations of standard stars P330E and G191B2B in\nCycle 11 (M. Dickinson et al. 2003, private communication). For SN 2003es and SN 2003ak\nwhich have non-complex backgrounds, the underlying \"sky\" was determined from isophotal\nmodeling of the host. For SN2003dy and SN2003eq the mean background was estimated\nwith local apertures. Table 2 includes the measured magnitudes of the SNe Ia presented\nhere. Figure 2 shows their light curves.\n\n2.3.\n\nSpectra\n\nSupernovae are best classified by the presence and absence of diagnostic features in\ntheir spectra (see Filippenko 1997 for review). For 14 of the 17 SNe listed in Table 1, we\nobtained spectra of the SNe near maximum light. For two of these (SN 2003lv and SN\n2002hp), bright, elliptical hosts yielded redshifts but overwhelmed the spectra of the SNe.\nFor the remaining three (SN 2003ak, SN 2003aj, and SN 2002fw), spectra of the hosts to\nidentify their redshifts were obtained when the SNe were no longer visible. Spectra of the\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ntwelve visible SNe are shown in Figure 3, and details of all the spectroscopy are provided in\nTable 3.\nTo classify the SNe, the detected SN spectra (shown in Figure 3) were cross-correlated\nwith template spectra (after removal of the continuum) to identify their type and redshift\nusing the \"SNID\" algorithm (Tonry et al. 2003). For the cases listed in Table 3 for\nwhich narrow-line host emission was identified, the redshift was constrained to the value\ndetermined from the host emission before cross-correlation. For cases where the spectra\nwere of low S/N, the significance of a SN Ia classification is much greater if the SN redshift\nis fixed a priori by host emission. For all 12 spectra shown in Figure 3, SNID provided a\nsignificant classification for each as type Ia. Although the diagnostic used by the SNID\nalgorithm relies on the whole spectrum, the majority of these SNe can also be classified as\ntype Ia from the presence of Si II absorption at 4130 \u00c5 (Coil et al. 2001). Specifically, Si II\nabsorption is detected in the two highest-redshift spectra presented here, SN 2003dy and\nSN 2002fw. Broad Ca II absorption near 3750 \u00c5 is visible in all the spectra as well, but this\nfeature is much less secure than Si II for SN Ia classification.\nFor two SNe (SN 2003lv and SN 2002hp) whose spectra were dominated by those of\ntheir hosts, the nature of their red, elliptical hosts allowed us to classify them as highly\nprobable SNe Ia (as was previously the case with SN 1997ff; Riess et al. 2001).\nFor the three SNe without any spectroscopy but with host redshifts, classification\nrequires greater consideration. Based on the UV color selection method described by Riess\net al. (2003), SN 2002fx, SN 2003ak, and SN 2003aj are likely to be SNe Ia because of\ntheir red discovery far-UV colors. However, further follow-up of SN 2003aj yielded a rapid\ndecline, uncharacteristic of normal SNe Ia (see Strolger et al. 2004). The photometric\nrecords of the other two are consistent with SNe Ia. A pre-discovery observation of SN\n2003ak on the rise is also consistent with the narrow range of SN Ia rise behavior which\nrise in 3 weeks (Riess et al. 1999b), but not with the majority of core-collapse SNe which\ntypically rise in 2 weeks or less, indicating it is very likely to be an SN Ia.\nFor the 16 SNe Ia (excluding SN 2003aj), we have sufficient quality of photometry to\nyield robust luminosity distances.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nTable 2.

shape and luminosity as well as color-curve\nshape and extinction. Our primary analysis uses a revision of the multi-color light-curve\nshape (MLCS) fitting method (Riess, Press, & Kirshner 1995, 1996a; Riess et al. 1998)\ndescribed by Jha (2002) and Jha et al. (2004a), and hereafter referred to as \"MLCS2k2.\"\nPrevious versions of MLCS fit rest-frame BV RI, but MLCS2k2 includes U band templates\nbased on a new set of 25 well-observed SNe Ia in the U band from Jha (2002) and Jha\net al. (2004b). This UV extension of MLCS allows us to extend the Hubble diagram of\nSNe Ia to z > 1 using light curves observed in the reddest available band on ACS. The\nresults from Jha (2002) demonstrate that rest-frame U-band light curves provide similar\ninformation on the epoch of maximum, relative luminosity, reddening, and distance as\noptical light curves, albeit with lower precision (by a factor of 1.5). Because the MLCS2k2\ncovariance matrix contains the bandpass-dependent variance of SNe Ia (primarily in the\nform of autocorrelation along the diagonals as well as in the form of two-point covariance in\noff-diagonal terms), the U-band light curves can be used together with optical light-curve\ndata with the appropriate weight and propagation of uncertainty in the multi-color fit.\nAdditional improvements to MLCS2k2 include a more self-consistent treatment of the\nallowed range of extinction and extinction laws, as well as an improved determination of\nthe unreddened SN Ia color (see Jha et al. 2004a for details). This method still empirically\nmodels a light curve as the sum of a fiducial template and a set of phase-dependent vectors\n(linear and quadratic) whose contribution scales with the luminosity offset from the fiducial\ncurve at peak. Luminosity corrections are not extrapolated beyond the range observed\nin the local sample. Simultaneous fitting in multiple colors constrains the line-of-sight\nreddening and distance.\n\nTable 2-Continued\n\nJDa\n\nVega Mag\n\nEpoch(rest)\n\n557.76\n\n23.85(0.09)\n\n3.2\n\na\n\nActually JD\u22122,450,000.\nUncertainties in magnitudes are listed in parentheses.\n\nK-Corr\n-1.86(0.03)\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nTable 3.

Recent analyses by the high-z\nsupernova search team (HZT; Schmidt et al. 1998) and the supernova cosmology project\n(SCP; Perlmutter et al. 1997), published respectively by Tonry et al. (2003) and Knop et\nal. (2003), make use of a Galactic prior for the extinction law (which is corroborated at\nlow redshifts; Riess, Press, Kirshner 1996b) and flag SNe with large reddening to reduce\nsystematic errors from non-Galactic-type dust. The HZT has employed an exponential\nextinction prior whose functional form derives from modeled lines-of-sight (Hatano, Branch,\n& Deaton 1998) and from the a posteriori distribution of extinction values. Here we utilize\nthe exponential prior on extinction and the gaussian prior on the intrinsic color derived\nfrom the a posteriori distribution of Jha et al. (2004a) and flag SNe with large measured\nreddening as unreliable. Each SN Ia is corrected for galactic reddening as estimated in the\ndirection of each SN by Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis (1999) before the observed colors are\nused to estimate the host reddening.\nK-corrections are used to account for the SN redshift and provide a transformation\nbetween an observed-frame magnitude and a rest-frame magnitude (Oke & Sandage 1968).\nWe use composite spectra of SNe Ia from Nugent et al. (2003) to calculate Vega-normalized\n\"cross-band\" K-corrections. Individual K-corrections were calculated to the best-matching\npassbands for the appropriate phase and redshift of the SN. Each SN is then fit using\nMLCS2k2 to provide a custom model of the phase-dependent colors. The colors of the\nNugent et al. (2003) spectral energy distributions are then matched to the model by\nmultiplication of a spline-interpolation. Next, the K-corrections are recalculated, and\nthe process continues until convergence (usually after two to three iterations). The final\nK-corrections are given for each measured magnitude in Table 2. The MLCS2k2 fits to each\nof the 16 new SNe Ia are shown in Figure 2 and the fit parameters are given in Table 4.\nWe have also used an additional light-curve fitting method, \"Bayesian Template\nMethod\" (BATM; Tonry et al. 2003), to provide independent estimates of the luminosity\ndistances of the new SN Ia data presented here. BATM is a \"template-fitting\" method\nwhich seeks to identify close matches between an individual SN Ia and a well-observed,\nlocal counterpart and then calculates their distance ratio by synthetically redshifting the\nnearby template to the observed frame. The current realization of BATM has far fewer\nU-band examples than MLCS2k2, because BATM was developed without the Jha (2002)\ndata. Consequently, BATM did not converge on a solution for three sparsely observed\nSNe Ia (SNe 2002kc, 2003be, and 2002fx), whose MLCS2k2 fits relied on sampling in the\nrest-frame U band.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n3.1.\n\nThe Ground-Based Discovery Set\n\nWe construct the expansion history of the Universe by using this new set of HSTdiscovered objects together with published observations of supernovae over a wide range\nin redshift. Tonry et al. (2003) have recently compiled the distances and redshifts for 172\nSNe Ia. Using available results from different light-curve fitting methods (including BATM,\nMLCS, \u2206m15 , snapshot, and stretch) for each SN Ia, Tonry et al. (2003) corrected for\nzeropoint differences between methods and provided best estimates of the distance to each\nSN Ia from a median of the distance estimates from individual methods.\nAlthough the Tonry et al (2003) data set represented the state of the art in February,\n2003, when it was submitted, there have been some significant developments since then that\nneed to be included to build the most relaible data set for analyzing the HST-discovered\nobjects. For the SCP, Knop et al. (2003) report on a new set of 11 SNe Ia at 0.4 < z < 0.85\nas well as on a reanalysis of the original high-redshift SNe Ia from the SCP (Perlmutter\net al. 1999). In this reanalysis they now exclude 15 of the 42 high-redshift SNe from\nPerlmutter et al. (1999) due to inaccurate color measurements and uncertain classification.\nKnop et al. (2003) flag an additional 6 of the original 42 SNe, as well as 5 of the new\n11 SNe, as likely SNe Ia but failing a \"strict SN Ia\" sample cut. For the HZT, Barris et\nal. (2004) report on a large set of new high-redshift SNe (22 in all), with widely varying\ndegrees of completeness of the spectroscopic and photometric records. Finally, Blakeslee et\nal. (2003) report on 2 new SNe Ia discovered with ACS on HST. The development of the\nMLCS2k2 method, which includes U-band observations when they are available, makes it\nworthwhile to revisit the previously published data.\nWe recompiled a set of previously observed SNe Ia relying on large, published samples,\nwhenever possible, to reduce systematic errors from differences in calibration. To compile\nSNe Ia at 0.01 < z < 0.15 we used the 3 largest, modern data sets of such SNe Ia published\nto date: the Cal\u00e1n-Tololo Survey (29 SNe Ia; Hamuy et al. 1996), the CfA Survey I (22\nSNe Ia; Riess et al. 1999a), and the CfA Survey II (44 SNe Ia; Jha et al. 2004b).9 At\nhigher redshifts we used SN Ia photometry published by Riess et al. (1998, 2001), Tonry\net al. (2003), Knop et al. (2003), and Barris et al. (2004), as well as SNe Ia tabulated by\nTonry et al. (2003) from Suntzeff et al. (2004), Leibundgut et al. (2004), Clochiatti et al.\n(2004), and Jha et al. (2004c). Despite the apparently large number of sources of data,\nthe majority of the data at z > 0.1 comes from the HZT (Schmidt et al. 1998; Riess et\nal. 1998), and thus the methods used to calibrate all of these SNe Ia are extremely similar\n9\n\nNote that the CfA SNe were generally discovered by other searches, especially the Lick Observatory SN\nSearch with the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (Filippenko et al. 2001; Filippenko 2003).\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n(and familiar to the authors of the present paper).\nIn order to reduce systematic errors which arise from differences in light-curve fitting\n(and K-correcting) methods, we have made every effort to consistently refit all the past\ndata with a single method, MLCS2k2 (Jha et al. 2004a). An exception was made for the\nhigh-redshift SNe Ia from the SCP (Perlmutter et al. 1999) because photometry of these\nSNe Ia remain unpublished. For these we utilized the reanalyzed distances as given by\nKnop et al. (2003). We transformed them to the MLCS2k2 distance scale by solving for the\nSN Ia luminosity zero-point required to match the mean distances to low-redshift objects\nfit by the two methods.\nUnfortunately, a large variation exists in the quality and breadth of the photometric\nand spectroscopic records of individual SNe. Ideally, each SN Ia would have the same\nwell-defined spectroscopic features (Filippenko 1997), a spectroscopic redshift, and\nwell-sampled light curves and color curves. However, this is often not the case. As with the\nphotometry, most of the extant high-redshift spectra from the SCP have not been published\n(e.g., Perlmutter et al. 1999; Knop et al. 2003). This makes it difficult to apply a uniform\nset of criteria to SNe Ia in constructing a cosmological sample.\nTo reflect the differences in the quality of the spectroscopic and photometric record for\nindividual supernovae, we divide the objects into \"high-confidence\" (hereafter \"gold\") and\n\"likely but not certain\" (hereafter \"silver\") subsets. Ideally, we would assign each supernova\na weight in any overall fit that reflected its individual uncertainty. However, distance\nerrors resulting from spurious problems more common to lower-confidence SNe Ia such as\nSN misclassification, large extinction (amplifying uncertain extragalactic extinction laws),\nand poorly constrained colors are difficult to quantify. So we use the coarser approach of\nseparating the high-confidence gold events from the larger set.\nWe adopted in our gold set all SNe Ia which were included by the original sources in\ntheir most stringent subsets (when such discriminations were made). Any SN Ia flagged as\nhaving a cause for a specific concern was not included in this set. The two primary reasons\nfor rejecting a SN Ia from this set are that (1) the classification, though plausible, was not\ncompelling (see discussion), and (2) the photometric record is too incomplete to yield a\nrobust distance (i.e., the number of model parameters is roughly equal to the number of\neffective samplings of the light curve).\nSNe Ia included in previous cosmological samples but rejected from our gold sample\ninclude SN 1999fh (poorly constrained light curve; Tonry et al. 2003), SN 1997ck (poor\ncolor information; Garnavich et al. 1998), all \"snapshot\" SNe Ia from Riess et al. (1998),\n15 SNe Ia from Perlmutter et al. (1999) later discarded by Knop et al. (2003) as well as 11\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nadditional SNe flagged by Knop et al. (2003; flag values 1, 2, 3), SNe Ia from Barris et al.\n(2003) without SNID classification, and any SN Ia with more than 1 mag of extinction or\nwhose light curve begins more than 10 rest-frame days after maximum as determined from\nthe MLCS2k2 fit.\nThe same criteria were applied to the GOODS SNe Ia whose individual classifications\nwere described in \u00a72.3. As a result, two of these SNe were rejected from the gold sample:\nSN 2002fx, whose classification was not certain enough, and SN 2002kc, whose fit indicated\n> 1 mag extinction. The gold set contains a total of 157 SNe Ia.\nThe silver set contains the objects identified by the above sources as likely SNe Ia but\nfailing one criterion for inclusion in the gold category. The silver set includes a total of 29\nSNe Ia. SNe failing more than one criterion were excluded from the analyses. The final\nmembership rosters of the subsets are tabulated in the Appendix.\nFor most of our cosmological analyses we focus on results derived from the gold set, but\nfor a few analyses with the largest number of free parameters (and thus the most limited\nin statistical inference) we include the silver set (with the caveats arising from its reduced\nreliability).\n\n4.\n\nCosmological Constraints\n\nDistance estimates from SN Ia light curves are derived from the luminosity distance,\nL\ndL =\n4\u03c0F\n\u0012\n\n\u0013 12\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere L and F are the intrinsic luminosity and observed flux of the SN within a given\npassband, respectively. Equivalently, logarithmic measures of the flux (apparent magnitude,\nm) and luminosity (absolute magnitude, M) were used to derive extinction-corrected\ndistance moduli, \u03bc0 = m \u2212 M = 5 log dL + 25 (dL in units of megaparsecs). In this context,\nthe luminosity is a \"nuisance parameter\" whose value is unimportant for kinematic (and\nmost cosmological) studies. We have used the MLCS2k2 method and the data described in\n\u00a72 to derive accurate and individual relative distance moduli for the sets of SNe described\nin \u00a73.\nIn Figure 4 we show the Hubble diagram of distance moduli and redshifts for the new\nHST-discovered SNe Ia in the gold and silver sets. Although these new SNe Ia span a\nwide range of redshift (0.21 < z < 1.55), their most valuable contribution to the SN Ia\nHubble diagram is in the highest-redshift region where they effectively delineate the range\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nat 0.85 < z < 1.55 with 11 new SNe Ia, including 6 of the 7 highest-redshift SNe known\n(the seventh being SN 1997ff; Riess et al. 2001).\nThe relationship between distance and redshift over a significant fraction of the Hubble\ntime can be considered either empirically as a record of the (integrated) expansion history\nof the Universe, or theoretically as constraints on the mass-energy terms contained in the\nFriedman equation and affecting the expansion. In the next subsections we consider both\napproaches.\n\n4.1.\n\nExpansion History: A Kinematic Description\n\nIt is valuable to consider the distance-redshift relation of SNe Ia as a purely kinematic\nrecord of the expansion history of the Universe, without regard to its cause. An empirical\ndescription of the time variation of the scale factor, a(t), can provide answers to basic\nquestions (e.g., \"When was the Universe (if ever) accelerating or decelerating?\") and\nmodel-independent constraints with which to test cosmological models.\nFollowing Turner & Riess (2002), we empirically define the luminosity distance in\nEuclidean space (i.e., \u03a9total = 1.0; as motivated by inflation) as the integral of the inverse\nof the preceding expansion rate,\n\ndL = c(1 + z)\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nz\n\ndu\n= c(1 + z)H0\u22121\nH(u)\n\nZ\n\nz\n0\n\n\u0014\n\nexp \u2212\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nu\n\n\u0015\n\n[1 + q(u)]d ln(1 + u) du,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\u0227\nH(z) = ,\na\nq(z) \u2261 (\u2212\u00e4/a)/H 2 (z) =\n\n(3)\ndH \u22121 (z)\n\u2212 1.\ndt\n\n(4)\n\nNote that equation (2) is not an approximation but is an exact expression for the luminosity\ndistance in a geometrically flat Universe (though generalizable for non-zero curvature),\ngiven an expression for the epoch-dependent deceleration parameter, q(z), and the present\nHubble constant, H0 . Here we employ equation (2) as a kinematic model of the SN Ia data\nwith parametric representations for q(z).\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nGiven evidence that the Universe has recently been accelerating [i.e., q(z \u223c 0) < 0],\nhints that it may have once been decelerating [i.e., q(z > 1) > 0; Riess et al. 2001; Turner\n& Riess 2002], and the large leverage in redshift of the current SN sample, we consider\nresolving q(z) into two distinct components or epochs. A linear two-parameter expansion\nfor q(z) which is continuous and smooth is q(z) = q0 + zdq/dz, where dq/dz is defined to be\nevaluated at z = 0.\nThe likelihood for the parameters q0 and dq/dz can be determined from a \u03c72 statistic,\nwhere\nX (\u03bcp,i (zi ; H0 , q0 , dq/dz) \u2212 \u03bc0,i )2\n(5)\n\u03c72 (H0 , q0 , dq/dz) =\n\u03c3\u03bc20,i + \u03c3v2\ni\n, \u03c3v is the dispersion in supernova redshift (transformed to units of distance moduli) due to\npeculiar velocities and \u03c3\u03bc0,i is the uncertainty in the individual distance moduli. This term\nalso includes the uncertainty in galaxy redshift. Due to the extreme redshift of our distant\nsample and the abundance of objects in the nearby sample, our analysis is insensitive to\nthe value we assume for \u03c3v within its likely range of 200 km s\u22121 \u2264 \u03c3v \u2264 500 km s\u22121 . For\nour analysis we adopt \u03c3v = 400 km s\u22121 . For high-redshift SNe Ia whose redshifts were\ndetermined from the broad features in the SN spectrum, we add 2500 km s\u22121 in quadrature\nto \u03c3v .\nMarginalizing our likelihood functions over the nuisance parameter, H0 (by integrating\n2\nthe probability density P \u221d e\u2212\u03c7 /2 for all values of H0 ), yields the confidence intervals\nshown in Figure 5. As shown, both the gold set or the gold and silver sets strongly favor\na Universe with recent acceleration (q0 < 0) and previous deceleration (dq/dz > 0) with\n99.2% and 99.8% likelihood (summed within this quadrant), respectively. With this same\nmodel we can also derive the likelihood function for the transition redshift, zt , defined as\nq(zt ) = 0. Summing the probability density in the q0 vs. dq/dz plane along lines of constant\ntransition redshift, zt = \u2212q0 /(dq/dz), yields the likelihood function in Figure 5. We find a\ntransition redshift of zt = 0.46 \u00b1 0.13. In Figure 6 we show the Hubble diagram for the\nSNe Ia compared to a discrete set of kinematic models.\nAn alternate, kinematic model is derived using the first three time derivatives of the\nscale factor. Following Visser (2003), the Hubble, deceleration, and jerk parameters are\ndefined as\nH(t) = +\u0227/a ,\n\n(6)\n\nq(t) = \u2212(\u00e4/a)(\u0227/a)\u22122 , and\n\n(7)\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n \u0307\nj(t) = +(\u00e4/a)(\n\u0227/a)\u22123 .\n\n(8)\n\nThe deceleration and jerk parameters are dimensionless, and a Taylor expansion of the\nscale factor around t0 provides\n\na(t) = a0\n\n1\n1\n1 + H0 (t \u2212 t0 ) \u2212 q0 H02 (t \u2212 t0 )2 + j0 H03 (t \u2212 t0 )3 + O([t \u2212 t0 ]4 ) ,\n2\n3!\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n\n(9)\n\nand hence for the luminosity distance (in Euclidean space),\ni\n1\n1h\ncz\n1 + [1 \u2212 q0 ] z \u2212 1 \u2212 q0 \u2212 3q02 + j0 z 2 + O(z 3 )\ndL (z) =\nH0\n2\n6\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n\n(10)\n\n(cf. Visser 2003).\n\nThough related, the j0 parameter as defined here and by Visser (2003) is not precisely\nequivalent to our previous dq/dz parameter, providing an alternative parameterization.\nThe SN subsets constrain the j0 parameter to the positive domain at the 92% to the 95%\nconfidence level. That is, the expansion history over the range of the SN data is equally\nwell-described by recent acceleration and a constant jerk. Models with discrete values of j0\nare shown in Figure 6.\nIn summary, we find strong evidence for a change in the sign of cosmic acceleration in\nthe past.\n\n4.2.\n\nCosmological Constant or Astrophysical Dimming?\n\nSNe Ia at z \u2248 0.5 appear fainter by \u223c0.25 mag relative to a Universe with \u03a9M = 0.3\nand \u03a9\u039b = 0, a result readily accommodated by a cosmological constant with \u03a9\u039b = 0.7\n(Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999). Despite the lack of any independent evidence,\nan alternative explanation for this dimming could lie in the astrophysics of supernovae or\nin the propogation of their light to us. Speculative models for astrophysical contamination\nof the SN Ia signal have been posited; these include extragalactic gray dust with negligible\ntell-tale reddening or added dispersion (Aguirre 1999a,b; Rana 1979, 1980), and a pure\nluminosity evolution (Drell, Loredo, & Wasserman 2000). Here we limit our consideration\nto the observable differences between these hypotheses.\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nThe luminosity distance expected in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology\nwith mass density \u03a9M and vacuum energy density (i.e., the cosmological constant) \u03a9\u039b is\ndL =\n\ncH0\u22121 (1\n\n+ z) |\u03a9k |\n\n\u22121/2\n\n1/2\n\nsinn{|\u03a9k |\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nz\n\ndz[(1 + z)2 (1 + \u03a9M z) \u2212 z(2 + z)\u03a9\u039b ]\u22121/2 }, (11)\n\nwhere \u03a9k = 1 \u2212 \u03a9M \u2212 \u03a9\u039b , and \"sinn\" is sinh for \u03a9k > 0 and sin for \u03a9k < 0 (Carroll, Press,\n& Turner 1992). For \u03a9k = 0, equation (11) reduces to cH0\u22121 (1 + z) times the integral. With\ndL in units of megaparsecs, the predicted distance modulus is\n\u03bcp = 5 log dL + 25.\n\n(12)\n\nFollowing Goobar, Bergstrom, & Mortsell (2002) we consider two models of gray\nextinction by a homogeneous component of dust: \u03c1dust (z) = \u03c1\u25e6dust (1 + z)\u03b1 , where\n\u03b1(z) =\n\n(\n\n3 for all z\n\"high \u2212 z dust,\u2032\u2032\n0 for z > 0.5 (3 for lower z). \"replenishing dust.\u2032\u2032\n\nThe \"high-z dust\" model represents a smooth background of dust present (presumably\nejected from galaxies) at a redshift which is greater than the SN sample (i.e., z > 2) and\ndiluting as the Universe expands. The total extinction is then calculated as the attenuation\nR\nintegrated along the photon path, \u22122.5 log (exp( 0z \u03c1dust (z)r(z)dz)), where r(z) is the\ncoordinate distance traversed by the SN photons. A single free (opacity) parameter is fixed\nby requiring the total extinction at z \u2248 0.5 to match the observed peak brightness of SNe Ia\nin a cosmology with \u03a9\u039b = 0.\nThe \"replenishing dust\" represents a constant density of dust which is continually\nreplenished at precisely the same rate in which it is diluted by the expanding Universe (i.e.,\n\u03b1 = 0). This model is also tuned to match the extinction implied by SNe Ia at z \u2248 0.5 in\nthe absence of a cosmological constant, hence it requires the tuning of two parameters (as\nwell as fast-moving dust which quickly provides a homogeneous background without added\ndispersion from uneven lines-of-sight). We also consider a third model (following Filippenko\n& Riess 2001, Riess et al. 2001, and Blakeslee et al. 2003) to mimic simple evolution which\nscales as z in percent dimming. Our set of models for astrophysical dimming is not an\nexhaustive set of all possibilities, but rather is drawn from physically motivated hypotheses\n(in contrast to purely parametric models of astrophysical dimming, e.g., Drell et al. 2000).\nIn Figure 7 we show the Hubble diagram of SNe Ia relative to the cosmological\nand astrophysical hypotheses. As seen in Table 4, the SN dataset is consistent with an\n\u03a9M = 0.27, \u03a9\u039b = 0.73 cosmology, yielding \u03c72 = 178 for 157 SNe Ia (degrees of freedom, dof;\n\u03c72dof = 1.13) in the gold set. The total \u03c72 is significantly worse for the high-redshift gray\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\ndust model (\u2206\u03c72 = 122; 11\u03c3 for 1 dof) as well as for the simple model of evolution with\ndimming \u221d z (\u2206\u03c72 = 70; 8\u03c3 for 1 dof), allowing us to reject both hypotheses with high\nconfidence. Interestingly, the \"replenishing dust\" model is nearly indistinguishable from\nan \u03a9\u039b model because the dimming is directly proportional to distance traveled and thus\nmathematically quite similar to the effects of a cosmological constant. Consequently, we\ncannot discriminate this model from an \u03a9\u039b -dominated model strictly from its behavior in\nthe magnitude-redshift plane (and probably never will be able to, given the small magnitude\ndifferences). However, the fine tuning required of this dust's opacity, replenishing rate, and\nvelocity (> 1000 km s\u22121 for it to fill space uniformly without adding detectable dispersion)\nmakes it unattractive as a simpler alternative to a cosmological constant.\n\n4.3.\n\nExploring Dark Energy\n\nDespite the results of the last section which favor the dark-energy interpretation of\nSNe Ia, we avoid using this conclusion as a starting point for exploring the nature of dark\nenergy. To do so would be to engage in \"circular reasoning\" or to incur more free parameters\nthan our limited dataset can usefully constrain. Instead, we embark on a parallel study\nfrom the previous section. Here we use distance-independent information to justify the\ncosmological interpretation of SNe Ia and combine with other experiments to study dark\nenergy.\nThe potential for luminosity evolution of corrected SN Ia distances has been studied\nusing a wide range of local host environments. No dependence of the distance measures\non the host morphology, mean stellar age, radial distance from the center, dust content,\nor mean metallicity has been seen (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999; Hamuy et al\n2000). No differences in the inferred cosmology were seen by Sullivan et al. (2003) for SNe Ia\nin early-type hosts or late-type hosts at high redshifts. These studies limit morphology\ndependence of SN Ia distances to the 5% level. Detailed studies of distance-independent\nobservables of SNe Ia such as their spectral energy distribution and temporal progression\nhave also been employed as probes of evolution; see Riess (2000), Leibundgut (2001),\nand Perlmutter & Schmidt (2003) for reviews. The consensus interpretation is that there\nis no evidence for evolution with limits at or below the statistical constraints on the\naverage high-redshift apparent brightness of SNe Ia. The observed nominal dispersion\nof high-redshift SNe Ia substantially limits the patchiness of uncorrected extinction, and\nnear-IR observations of a high-redshift SN Ia demonstrate that a large opacity from grayish\ndust is unlikely (Riess et al. 2001). Non-SN constraints on gray dust from QSOs observed\nin X-rays (Paerels et al. 2002; Ninomiya, Yaqoob, & Khan 2003) and a partial or complete\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nresolution of the far-IR background by SCUBA (Chapman et al. 2003) place stringent\nlimits of less than a few percent of dimming at z = 0.5 from gray dust.\nBased on this evidence, we will adopt in the following analysis an a priori constraint\nthat the net astrophysical contamination of SN Ia distance measures does not exceed their\nstatistical uncertainty in their mean brightness. Quantitatively, our adopted limit on\nsystematics is defined to be 5% per \u2206z at z > 0.1.\nFirst we consider the SN data within an FRW cosmology of unknown curvature\nand mass density (with a flat prior on all parameters), with the simplest description\nof a dark-energy component (i.e., a cosmological constant) using equation (11). Joint\nconfidence intervals in the \u03a9M \u2212 \u03a9\u039b plane were derived after numerical integration of\nthe probability density P (H0 ) \u221d exp(\u2212\u03c72 (H0 )/2) over all values of H0 and are shown in\nFigure 8. Compared to the same analysis in Riess et al. (1998), the gold sample presented\nhere reduces the area of the 1\u03c3 contour by a factor of 6 (a factor of 7 including the silver\nsample). With the current sample, the 4\u03c3 confidence intervals (i.e., > 99.99% confidence)\nare now fully contained within the region where \u03a9\u039b > 0. The \"concordance\" model, of\n\u03a9M = 0.27, \u03a9\u039b = 0.73 lies within the 1\u03c3 contour (though just outside of it with the addition\nof the silver set). For a flat geometry prior, we measure \u03a9M = 0.29\u00b10.05\n0.03 (equivalently\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.71). The HST-discovered SNe Ia alone decrease the area of the 1\u03c3 contour by a\nfactor of 1.5 (in the gold sample) due to their high mean redshift.\nAn alternative approach with good precedent (Garnavich et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al.\n1999) is to consider a flat Universe and a generalized dark-energy component parameterized\nby its (assumed) constant equation of state, w = P/\u03c1c2 . Flatness is assumed either on\ntheoretical grounds (i.e., as a consequence of inflation) or on observational grounds from\nthe characteristic angular size scale of the CMB fluctuations (Spergel et al. 2003, and\nreferences therein). In this case the luminosity distance is given by\ndL = cH0\u22121(1 + z)\n\nZ\n\nz\n0\n\ndz[(1 + z)3 (\u03a9M ) + (1 \u2212 \u03a9M )(1 + z)3(1+w) ]\u22121/2 .\n\n(13)\n\nWe determined the probability density in the \u03a9M \u2212 w plane in the same manner\nas above and the results are shown in the left panel of Figure 9. The SN Ia data alone\nrequire w < \u22120.5 for any value of \u03a9M at the 95% confidence level and are consistent with\nw = \u22121 (i.e., dark energy resembling a cosmological constant) at the 68% confidence level\nfor 0.20 < \u03a9M < 0.35.\nUtilizing SN-independent constraints in this plane (primarily to constrain \u03a9M ) yields\nfar more precise constraints for w due to the strong degeneracy between w and \u03a9M for\nSNe Ia. In the left panel of Figure 9 we use \u03a9M = 0.27 \u00b1 0.04 (at z = 0) as a simple\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\napproximation to the constraints derived from numerous SN-independent experiments (see\nFreedman & Turner 2003 for a review). Alternatively (right panel, Figure 9), we used the\nWMAPext (Bennett et al. 2003; Spergel et al. 2003) measurement of the reduced distance to\nthe surface of last scattering at z = 1089 and the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey\n(2dFGRS) measurement of the growth parameter, f = (\u03a9M /(\u03a9M + (1 \u2212 \u03a9M )(1 + z)3w ))0.6 ,\nto derive independent constraints in the \u03a9M \u2212 w plane. The results from either approach are\n0.20\nsimilar. We find w = \u22121.02\u00b10.13\n0.19 and w = \u22121.08\u00b10.18 with the use of an \u03a9M prior and from\nWMAPext+2dFGRS, respectively. Using the prior on \u03a9M , the 95% confidence interval is\n\u22120.78 > w > \u22121.46, or w < \u22120.76 if w \u2265 \u22121. The 99% level constrains w < \u22120.72. These\nresults are somewhat more constraining than those from Tonry et al. (2003), Barris et al.\n(2004), Knop et al. (2003).\nThe high relative redshifts of the HST-discovered SNe Ia provide little additional\npower to constrain a w parameter which is fixed a priori to be redshift-independent. The\nprecision of such a constrained study of dark energy is most sensitive to the sheer number\nof SNe Ia with a relatively weak dependence on their redshifts (a useful approximation is\n\u2206m \u2248 [1.8z/(1 + ez )]\u2206w for small \u2206w, w \u2248 \u22121, and z < 2) until the systematic error limit\nis reached.\nA more ambitious and potentially more revealing approach to studying dark energy\nis to allow for both an unconstrained value of the equation of state (at some fiducial\nredshift, e.g., z = 0) and its time evolution, i.e., w(z) = w0 + w \u2032 z, where w \u2032 \u2261 dw\n| .\ndz z=0\nThis parameterization provides the minimum possible resolving power to distinguish a\ncosmological constant and a rolling scalar field from their time variation (or lack thereof).\nIndeed, rejection of the hypothesis that w \u2032 = 0 would rule out a cosmological constant as\nthe dark energy (as would the determination that w 6= \u22121). The measured value of w \u2032\nwould provide an estimate of the scale length of a dark-energy potential. The only previous\nestimate of w \u2032, by Di Pietro & Claeskens (2003), used the set of SNe Ia from Perlmutter et\nal. (1999) and the constraints \u03a9total \u2261 1 and \u03a9M \u2261 0.3, and concluded \u221212 < w \u2032 < 12 at\nthe 95% confidence level (best fit: w0 = \u22121.4, w \u2032 = 2.3).\nFor w(z) = w0 + w \u2032 z, we employ (following Linder 2003)\n\ndL =\n\ncH0\u22121 (1\n\n+ z)\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nz\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ndz[(1 + z)3 (\u03a9M ) + (1 \u2212 \u03a9M )(1 + z)3(1+w0 \u2212w ) e3w z ]\u22121/2 .\n\n(14)\n\nA strong degeneracy exists among the three free parameters w0 , w \u2032, and \u03a9M , requiring the\nuse of independent experimental constraints in this space to make progress. To this end\nwe use the previous prior, \u03a9M = 0.27 \u00b1 0.04 (at z = 0), which has the advantage of being\nindependent of redshift while providing a good approximation to all non-SN cosmological\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\nconstraints in this space.\nWe have avoided using the CMB measurements directly as an additional constraint on\nthe time evolution of the equation of state of dark energy due to difficulties which arise in the\nanalysis of the CMB at z >> 1 where the linear expansion of the epoch-dependent equation\nof state diverges. Because constraints on w(z) from the CMB are derived from an integration\nbetween z = 0 and z = 1089, diverging formulations of w(z) are unsuitable. Linder (2003)\nhas proposed a more stable parameterization of w(z) = w0 + wa (z/(1 + z)); however, for\nlarge values of w0 + wa , which are not rejected by the Di Pietro & Claeskens (2003) analysis,\nthe CMB integral remains ill-behaved. In addition, the CMB measurements provide little\ndirect leverage on wa or w \u2032 compared to SNe Ia at z \u2248 1 (because \u03a9DarkEnergy \u2248 0 at\nz >> 1). Therefore, we used the w \u2032 parameterization which is well-suited to our SN sample,\nand a simple prior on \u03a9M which avoids problems evaluating functions involving w(z) at\nz >> 1.\nIn Figure 10 we show constraints in the w0 \u2212 w \u2032 plane (after marginalizing over \u03a9M ).\n\u2032\n0.81\nUsing the gold subset, we find w0 = \u22121.31\u00b10.22\n0.28 and w = 1.48\u00b10.90 with the uncertainties\nin both parameters strongly correlated. A cosmological constant (i.e., w0 = \u22121, w \u2032 = 0) is\nseparated from the best fit along the direction of the major axis of the error ellipse, lying at\nthe boundary of the joint 68% confidence level. If we constrain the recent behavior of dark\nenergy to be like a cosmological constant (i.e., w0 = \u22121) we find w \u2032 = 0.60 \u00b1 0.47. Models\nwith w0 < \u22121 or \"phantom energy\" (Caldwell et al 2003) violate the Dominant-Energy\ncondition (\u03c1 + p > 0) and are extremely speculative at this point (and may rip apart the\nUniverse in the future), so if we constrain the analysis to w0 > \u22121 we find w \u2032 = 0.6 \u00b1 0.5\nand w0 < \u22120.72 with 95% confidence. Unfortunately, few theoretical predictions about the\nsize of w \u2032 exist for dynamic models of dark energy. However, we can reject the possibility\nthat dark-energy evolution is currently very rapid (i.e., |w \u2032| > a few). This conclusion alone\nlimits the rate at which simple rolling scalar fields could reach their true minima. The\nconsequences of this statement for predicting the future fate of the Universe are discussed\nin \u00a75.\nOur new constraints in the w \u2032 \u2212w plane provide a substantial factor of \u223c 8 improvement\nover the analysis by Di Pietro & Claeskens (2003) of the SCP (Perlmutter et al. 1999)\ndata. Still, greater precision for the measurement of w \u2032 is needed before the proximity (or\nseparation) from w \u2032 = 0 would provide a compelling, empirical case for (or against) a static\ndark energy (i.e., a cosmological constant). The addition of the silver sample has only a\nmodest impact on this analysis, as seen in Figure 10 (although a cosmological constant\ncrosses to just outside the nominal 68% confidence interval).\nThe HST-discovered SNe Ia provide significant leverage in the w0 \u2212 w \u2032 plane due to\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\ntheir high mean redshift. Figure 10 (upper left panel) shows the w \u2032 \u2212 w plane without\nincluding the HST-discovered objects. The HST-discovered SNe Ia alone increase the\nprecision (i.e., reduce the area of the confidence intervals) by an impressive factor of\n1.9, although they account for only 10% of the sample. Previous studies in support of a\ndedicated, space-based mission to measure w0 and w \u2032 have concluded that a SN Ia sample\nmust extend to z > 1.5 to adequately break degeneracies in this parameter space (Linder\n& Huterer 2003), a conclusion supported by our analysis. The current relative dearth of\nSNe Ia at z > 1 compared to their number at z < 1 indicates that significant progress\ncan still be made in the constraints on w \u2032 . Proposals for a Supernova Acceleration Probe\n(SNAP) or a Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) predict an improved constraint for w \u2032\nover our current analysis by a factor of 3 to 4, assuming a similar-sized improvement in our\nknowledge of \u03a9M from the Planck Satellite and a continued ability to reduce systematic\nerrors (Linder & Huterer 2003). However, the current sample is rapidly growing in size and\nwe may expect progress in our constraints on the nature of dark energy in the next few\nyears.\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nCosmological Constraints\n\nSNe Ia at z > 1 provide valuable and unique contributions to our current understanding\nof the cosmological model. The current sample of such SNe Ia, though greatly expanded\nhere, remains small (i.e., < 10). Our capacity to constrain simultaneously the full debated\nrange of cosmological and environmental parameters is therefore limited. Consequently, we\nhave chosen to test specific and narrow questions in the context of well-defined assumptions\nor in conjunction with independent information. It is important to recognize that the\nconclusions garnered from any analysis cannot furnish a priori information for a subsequent\nanalysis. Readers should carefully consider which priors they are using and where they\ncame from before selecting which analysis presented here provides a relevant incremental\ngain.\nThe two most extreme analyses (in the sense of the breadth of their priors) presented\nhere also realize the most significant gains from the addition of our highest-redshift SNe Ia\ndiscovered with HST. The kinematic (i.e., cause-independent) interpretation of SN Ia\ndistances and redshifts (independent of all other experiments) is most consistent with two\ndistinct epochs of expansion: a recent accelerated expansion and a previous decelerated\nexpansion with a transition between the two at z \u2248 0.5. This is a generic requirement of\na mixed dark matter and dark energy universe, and it may even be a feature of unrelated\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\ncosmological paradigms (which are beyond our scope to consider here). The data are\nnot consistent with many astrophysical interpretations posited in lieu of dark energy.\nNotable examples include the attenuation produced in a universe filled with gray dust at\nz > 1, or a luminosity evolution which is a simple, monotonic function of redshift. These\ninterpretations are robust against the exclusion of any individual SN Ia used in the analyses\nand therefore represent an improvement over the results of Riess et al. (2001).\nA vacuum-driven metamorphosis model (VCDM) has been proposed by Parker & Raval\n(1999) to explain the cause of accelerated expansion. In this model the Universe makes a\ntransition to a constant-scalar-curvature (induced by a quantized non-interacting scalar field\nof very small mass in its vacuum state) at z \u2248 1. This model differs from a quintessence\nmodel in that the scalar field is free and thus interacts only with the gravitational field.\nThe transition as described by Parker, Komp, & Vanzella (2003) is far more abrupt than for\na cosmological constant and is characterized by w0 = \u22121.3 and w \u2032 = \u22120.8 for values of \u03a9M\nwithin its likely range. These values lay just outside the 99.5% confidence level. However,\nother future variations of the central idea of this model may yield better fits to the data.\nThe \"replenishing dust\" model addressed in \u00a74.2 is one example of a variety of\nastrophysical dimming models for which most of the apparent dimming occurs by z \u2248 0.5,\nwith little additional dimming at z > 0.5. Such models require an additional parameter or\na logarithmic parameterization to dampen the dimming and fit the new SNe Ia at higher\nredshifts. Another model with this behavior would be evolution which is proportional to\nlook-back time (Wright 2002). While possible, such dimming behavior, especially if in\nthe form of luminosity evolution, would seem implausible. We may expect evolution (or\ndust production) to be coupled to the observed evolution of stellar populations, galaxy\nmorphologies, sizes, large-scale structure, or even chemical enrichment. None of these\nknown varieties of evolution are largely completed by z = 0.5 starting from their properties\nat z = 0; quite the contrary, most of them have hardly begun, looking back to z = 0.5.\nA strong empirical argument against recent luminosity evolution is the independence of\nSN Ia distance measures on gross host morphology (Riess et al. 1998; Sullivan et al. 2003).\nThe range of progenitor formation environments spanned by SNe Ia in early-type and\nlate-type hosts greatly exceeds any evolution in the mean host properties between z = 0\nand z = 0.5. In the end, however, the only \"proof\" against astrophysical contamination\nof the cosmological signal from SNe Ia is to test the results against other experiments,\nindependent of SNe Ia.\nSNe Ia are no longer unique in their requirement of a dominant dark-energy component.\nThe bevy of SN-independent cosmological experiments, most notably the CMB, LSS and\nthe ISW effect, provide a prior constraint of \u03a9total = 1 and \u03a9M \u2248 0.3. These priors preserve\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\nthe limited discriminating power of SN Ia data for resolving the nature of dark energy.\nWhat is its equation of state and has it been evolving? The constraints obtained here\nprovide a substantial improvement in our ability to answer the latter (i.e., not rapidly), but\nthe results are far from a compelling, empirical case for a cosmological constant or evolving\ndark energy.\nA parametric reconstruction of w(z) by Alam et al (2003) of the full set of SN Ia\ndistances from Tonry et al (2003) and Barris et al (2003) concluded that dark energy\n\"evolves rapidly\" and has \"metamorphosized\" from w \u223c 0 at z \u223c 1 to w < \u22121 at z \u223c 0.\nTheir analysis differs from ours in a few important ways. Alam et al (2003) use a significant\nnumber of SNe that would fail our selection criteria of our gold sample including 26 SNe\nfrom the SCP (now excluded or flagged by Knop et al 2003) and another 13 from Barris et\nal (2003) of dubious reliability. Alam et al (2003) also use a different parameterization for\nw(z) and slightly different external cosmological constraints. These differences do account\nfor a small part of the difference in our conclusions. However, despite these differences our\nresults are fairly similar to theirs without the inclusion of the new HST-discovered SNe Ia\npresented here as seen in the upper left panel of Figure 10. Without the HST-discovered\nSNe, the 95% confidence region resides in the quadrant in which w0 < \u22121 and w(z) was less\nnegative in the past. Yet, with the addition of the HST-discovered SNe Ia, the contours\nshrink in area by a factor of 2 and shift in the direction of a cosmological constant, a\nposition in the w0 \u2212 w \u2032 plane which is now at the boundary of the \u223c 1 \u03c3 contour. Such\nlarge changes in the size and position of the error contours with the addition of new data\nindicates the crucial need for even more data before firmer conclusions can be reached.\nKnowledge of the equation of state of dark energy and its time evolution has profound\nimplications for determining the fate of the Universe. For example, a joint constraint of\nw0 > \u22121 and w \u2032 < 0 could provide the signature of a future recollapse (i.e., \"Big Crunch\")\nfor a linear potential field which becomes negative in the future (Kallosh & Linde 2003).\nInterestingly, the data indicate that this quadrant of the w0 \u2212 w \u2032 plane is the least favored.\nValues (in this quadrant) farthest from the origin (w0 = \u22121 and w \u2032 = 0) would forecast\nthe earliest possible recollapse and are the least favored by our data. Taking the Kallosh &\nLinde (2003) toy model at face value, our constraint would rule out such a future recollapse\nof the Universe in less than \u223c 30 or 15 Gyr at the 95% or 99% confidence levels, respectively.\nThis is somewhat more reassuring than the previous minimal remaining time to recollapse\nof 11 Gyr allowed by the observation that the dark-energy density has had time to evolve\nto \u03a9\u039b \u2264 0.72 (Kallosh et al. 2003).\nA qualitatively different and more speculative fate, a hierarchical \"ripping\" of\nprogressively smaller bound systems (i.e., \"Big Rip\") might occur if w(z) evolves to or\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\nremains at values less than \u22121 (Caldwell, Kamionkowski, & Weinberg 2003). In this\ncase the dark-energy density within any bound system would increase without limit as\n\u03c1 \u221d a\u22123(1+w) , overcoming its binding energy. This eventuality may be foretold from joint\nconstraints of w0 < \u22121 and w \u2032 > 0 and (an assumed) linear extrapolation of the dark-energy\nscalar field. The current data are not inconsistent with this quadrant of the w0 \u2212 w \u2032 plane\n(and will remain consistent if dark energy is a cosmological constant and measurements\nhave finite precision). For an assumed constant equation of state, our 95% confidence\ninterval would limit a \"Big Rip\" to be no sooner than 25 Gyr from now, only slightly more\nreassuring than the previous estimate of minimal remaining time to the Rip of 22 Gyr\nestimated by Caldwell, Kamionkowski, & Weinberg (2003). However, if w(z) is evolving to\nprogressively more negative values (a result empirically consistent with our data), a Rip\ncould occur far sooner. We are limited by our understanding of how the future equation of\nstate of dark energy would track the scale factor, time, or some other global parameter of\nthe Universe. Therefore, if dark energy is evolving in this direction, we cannot place any\nmeaningful empirical limit on the minimum time to the Rip.\nWe caution against naively extrapolating our empirical dynamical constraint (fit over\na very small range in redshift) far from the time at which it was derived and is likely to be\nmeaningful. The empirical approach to determining the fate of the Universe must rely on\nlarge extrapolations until dark energy is better understood.\n\n5.2.\n\nTests of the Utility of Supernovae\n\nMany more SNe Ia at z > 1 may yield a more precise probe of dark energy, provided\nthe statistical power of a larger sample can be realized. It is therefore of interest to use the\ncurrent set of SNe Ia at z > 1 to consider whether there are any reasons to believe this goal\ncould not be accomplished.\nThe dispersion of the SNe Ia at z > 1.0 around the best fit model is 0.29 mag, similar\nto the 0.27 mag dispersion of the sample at 0.1 < z < 1.0. (We note that these values are\nhigher than the nominal intrinsic dispersion of \u223c0.15 mag due to the sparse sampling and\nnoisy photometry of SNe Ia observed at high redshifts.) In addition, the average \u03c72 per SN\nat z > 1.0 (9 objects in the gold sample) is 0.95 for the concordance model. We conclude\nthat there is no evidence of excess dispersion for SNe Ia at z > 1.\nAnother test of evolutionary effects is to compare the distribution of light-curve shapes\nfor the HST-discovered SNe Ia with those at low redshift. In Figure 11 we compare the\nindividually normalized (i.e., after subtraction of the individual peak day and apparent\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\nmagnitude), rest-frame (i.e., after K-corrections and correcting for 1 + z time dilation)\nlight curves of these samples. Statistically, the measured magnitudes of HST-discovered SN\nlight curves (with median redshift 1) are consistent with having been drawn from a parent\npopulation at low redshift. The fitted distributions of light-curve shape parameters from\nthe MLCS2k2 parameterization, \u2206 (Riess et al. 1996a; Jha et al. 2004a), are also consistent\nfor the two populations as shown in Figure 12.\nSome evidence for anomalously blue colors of the high-redshift SNe Ia in the objects\nfrom Riess et al. (1998) was noted by Falco et al. (1999) and Leibundgut (2001). The\nindicated mean difference was a few hundredths of a magnitude in data transformed to\nrest-frame B \u2212V with a significance approaching 2\u03c3. No such difference was seen in the data\nfrom Perlmutter et al. (1999), although the individual precision of their measured colors\nmay have precluded the detection of such an anomaly. Here we have used the expanded\ndata set and its redshift leverage to look for evidence of color evolution in both rest-frame\nB \u2212 V and U \u2212 B. The ultraviolet colors of SNe Ia are predicted by theory to be the most\nsensitive to chemical abundances (H\u00f6flich, Wheeler, & Thielemann 1998). Figure 13 shows\nboth of these colors as a function of redshift for the sample in a modest range around the\nunreddened colors of SNe Ia. In Figure 14 we have constructed histograms for the colors in\nthree redshift ranges: z < 0.1, 0.1 < z < 0.6, and 0.6 < z < 1.6. For B \u2212 V , the middle\nbin is bluer in the mean by 0.02 mag than the lowest bin, and despite the increased sample\nsize the significance of this difference remains 2\u03c3. This result is not surprising because\nit makes use of similar data as the previous analysis. Interestingly, the size of the mean\ndifferences decreases for the highest-redshift bin to 0.01 mag with an even lower significance\nof 1\u03c3. For the U \u2212 B data, the lowest and highest-redshift bins are consistent in their\nmeans of \u22120.45 \u00b1 0.02 mag and \u22120.47 \u00b1 0.02 mag, respectively. (Negligible data for U \u2212 B\nin the middle redshift bin is available.) Of the three comparisons presented here, only the\npreviously noted B \u2212 V comparison between low and intermediate redshifts is suspect. If\nthe colors of SNe Ia were evolving, we would expect the comparison at higher redshifts, and\nadditionally with more chemically sensitive colors, to provide amplified evidence for the\neffect. In addition, the increased sample size in the low and intermediate-redshift bins has\nnot produced an increase in the significance of the anomaly as would be expected for a real\neffect. We therefore conclude there is insufficient evidence for color evolution of SNe Ia with\nthe current sample, but we encourage future investigators to remain aware of (and test for)\nthis possibility.\nOverall, the data presented here suggest that SNe Ia at z > 1 remain empirically\nwell-behaved and show promise for providing robust cosmological measurements.\nTo test the sensitivity of our results to the light-curve fitting method used, we\n\n\f\u2013 36 \u2013\ncompared the MLCS2k2 distances of the HST-discovered SNe Ia to those derived from\nBATM (Tonry et al. 2003). For this comparison, the distance scales of the two methods\nwere normalized by matching the mean distances calculated for the same SNe Ia from\nTonry et al (2003). In Figure 15 we show a comparison for the SNe Ia fit by both methods\nover a wide range in redshift. The mean difference (weighted by the quadrature sum of the\nindividual uncertainties) for the HST-discovered SNe Ia is 0.047 mag (in the sense that the\nBATM distances are larger). This difference is consistent (at the 1\u03c3 confidence level) with\nan independent mean uncertainty of 0.18 mag for each method. If we limit the comparison\nto the 9 HST-discovered SNe Ia at z > 0.9, the mean difference diminishes to < 0.01\nmag. Because this higher-redshift range provides the leverage utilized for the updated\ncosmological conclusions presented here, we conclude that our results are insensitive to the\nlight-curve fitting method.\nThe problem of heterogeneity of SN Ia data may be addressed by future, massive SN\nsurveys such as ESSENCE (Smith et al. 2002; Garnavich et al. 2002) or the CFHT Legacy\nSurvey (Pain et al. 2002), which will obtain large sets of SNe Ia over the full range of\nexplored redshifts (obviating the need for older, heterogeneous data). Until then, we must\nrely on a careful and judicious compilation of the available data and a clear description of\nhow they were compiled.\nFarrah et al. have used the statistical measurement (most individual hosts were not\ndetected) of sub-millimetre emission from high-redshift SN Ia hosts to infer the average\ninternal extinction of these galaxies. They then assume that the line-of-sight extinction\nof supernovae matches the inferred mean extinction of the hosts. They conclude that the\nSNe Ia from hosts at higher redshifts may suffer more extinction than their lower redshift\ncounterparts and this effect may bias the inferred cosmology. However, it has not been\ndemonstrated that radio emission correlates well (if at all) with SN extinction. In contrast,\napparent reddening has been shown to provide a significant reduction in distance dispersion\nand should account for any change in the relative proportions of host extinction along the\nline-of-sight. More relevant to this work, a trend of increased and uncorrected extinction\nwith redshift does not match the apparent magnitudes of the new SNe Ia presented here in\nthe highest redshift bin.\n\n5.3.\n\nLensing\n\nUntil now, we have evaluated the SN data in the context of a homogeneous model\nfor the matter distribution, also known as the \"filled-beam\" model. The inhomogeneity of\nmatter along the SN line-of-sight distorts space-time, directing more or less photon-filled\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\nlines-of-sight to our detectors depending on the matter content along the line of sight.\nAveraged over enough lines-of-sight, SN flux is conserved, and the inferred cosmology is\nunaffected. However, further investigation of possible lensing is warranted for small sample\nsizes and in regard to possible selection biases.\nWe have estimated the expected lensing along the line-of-sight of each of the\nHST-discovered SNe Ia as well as for 100 randomly selected positions in each of the GOODS\nfields. The lensing is estimated using the same multiple lens-plane methodology employed\nby Ben\u0131\u0301tez et al. (2002) for SN 1997ff. Photometric and spectroscopic redshifts of all\nforeground lenses were derived from the GOODS catalogs. Their masses were estimated\nfrom the rest-frame B-band luminosities and from the Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson\nrelations corrected for evolution (Ziegler et al. 2001; Boehm et al. 2003; Kochanek 1996;\nTreu et al. 2002). Because SN luminosity distances here and elsewhere have been modeled\nusing \"filled-beam\" cosmological models, we have calculated the amplifications relative to a\nfilled-beam model and for \u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7. The results are shown in Figure 16.\nAs expected, the distribution of net amplifications for random 3-dimensional positions\nin the fields scatters about unity with a width steadily increasing with redshift (simulations\npredict \u03c3 = 0.03 mag per unit redshift as indicated; D. Holz 2003, private communication).\nRelatively underdense and frequent lines-of-sight resulting in net deamplification are\ncompensated by an extended tail of strong magnifications, resulting in an increasingly\nskewed distribution at higher redshifts. These results are in good accord with Monte Carlo\nsimulations of this effect (Holz 1998; Metcalf & Silk 1999).\nWe find that the magnification estimates for the SNe Ia discovered in the GOODS\nsurvey are consistent with having been drawn from those in the random positions sample.\nWe conclude that there is no evidence of a lensing-induced selection bias of our sample.\nThis is not unexpected since most of our SNe Ia were discovered at > 2 mag brighter than\nthe survey limit and lensing would contribute an insignificant \u2264 0.2 mag of amplification\nfor 98% of the population at z < 1.5.\nInterestingly, there is an indication that the discovery of SNe Ia in the HDF-N found\nby other surveys could have been favored by amplification. The net amplification of SN\n1997ff of \u223c 0.3 mag (Benitze et al. 2002) is unusually large and the SN was within 0.5 mag\nof its survey limit (Gilliland, Nugent, & Phillips 1999). It is less clear whether the discovery\nof SN 2002dd (z = 0.95) could have been favored by its 0.2 mag amplification due to the\nserendipity of its discovery (Blakeslee et al. 2003).\nIn the absence of an apparent selection bias (or bad luck) in our SN survey, it\nis unnecessary (and even undesirable) to correct individual SNe for the estimated net\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\namplification, as the sample will approach a mean amplification of unity when considered\nin a filled-beam model. An important exception would be to correct (or flag) SNe whose\npredicted amplification places them on the strong lensing tail, such as SN 1997ff as done\nby Benitez et al (2001), Tonry et al (2003) and here. However, an independent test of this\nconclusion is available by comparing the predicted amplifications with the observed residuals\nfrom a good-fit cosmological model. In Figure 17 we show this comparison and their\nderived correlation. Empirically we find the residuals to be 1.6 \u00b1 0.9 times the predicted\nmagnifications, consistent with the theoretical relation (i.e., unity) and inconsistent with\nno correlation at the 1.7\u03c3 (80%) confidence level. Much of the leverage comes from SN\n1997ff; without it, the correlation is 1.0 \u00b1 1.2. As the sample expands, it may soon be\npossible to provide independent evidence of the correlation of dark matter and light from\nthe high-redshift SN sample.\nMortsell, Gunnarsson, & Goobar (2001) (hereafter MGG2001) and more recently\nGunnarsson (2004) have made predictions of the expected magnification of two of the SNe Ia\nin our sample, both contained in the original HDF-N. For SN 1997ff (z = 1.7) these authors\nconcluded the magnification was uncertain and potentially large (i.e., as high as a factor\nof a few). In contrast, Ben\u0131\u0301tez et al. (2002) estimated a much more modest magnification\nof 0.34 \u00b1 0.12 mag, in good agreement with the values estimated by Lewis & Ibata (2001)\nand Riess et al. (2001). The source of the potentially higher magnification can be traced\nto differences in the treatment of the mass scaling of the foreground lenses. MGG2001\ntreated the lensing galaxies as unevolved with an unknown but possibly high mass scaling\n(e.g., velocity dispersions of 200 to 300 km s\u22121 for M\u2217 galaxies with MB = \u221219.5 + 5 log h).\nBen\u0131\u0301tez et al. (2002) used the B-band Tully-Fisher relation observed by Ziegler et al.\n(2002) for late-type galaxies at redshifts 0.1\u20131.0 to provide a slope and normalization which\naccounts for evolution (which yields a velocity dispersion M\u2217 \u223c 150 km s\u22121 ). The result is\na much smaller mass scale than that considered by MGG2001 for the foreground lenses of\nhigh-redshift SNe.\nFor SN 2003es, Gunnarsson (2004) estimated a magnification factor of 1.15 (with a\nvelocity dispersion of 170 km s\u22121 ) for 13 apparent foreground galaxies (at z < 0.968) based\nprimarily on optical photometric redshifts. To span the rest-frame optical breaks in the\nspectral energy distributions of potential high-redshift foreground galaxies and reliably\nestimate their redshifts, it is important to use near-IR observations with good precision.\nWe reanalyzed the photometric redshifts of these 13 galaxies using the high-resolution\nnear-IR data from NICMOS (Budavari et al. 2000). In the majority of cases we found that\nthe data from Fernandez-Soto, Lanzetta & Yahil (1999) and Gwynn & Hartwick (1996)\ncontained detections in only 3 or 4 bands whereas the NICMOS data provided a total of 5\nto 7 bands and with greater leverage. We found 7 of the 13 galaxies to lie in the background\n\n\f\u2013 39 \u2013\nof the SN. Repeating the analysis of Gunnarsson (2004) using their Q-LET algorithm for\nthe 7 remaining foreground galaxies reduced the predicted magnification factor to 1.10.\nHowever, calculations from the Q-LET algorithm are made relative to a non-filled-beam\ncosmology and hence all lines-of-sight are amplified (in the absence of any foreground lenses\nthe Q-LET amplification would be 1.0). At the redshift of SN 2003es, the average strong\nlensing amplification would be \u223c0.03 mag so the remaining excess would be a factor of\n1.07. The remaining difference between this value and our estimate of 1.03 results from the\npreviously discussed difference in the treatment of the size and evolution of the mass scale.\nOur analysis, comparing the predicted magnification and observed cosmological residuals,\nis consistent with the mass scaling from Ziegler et al. (2002) as utilized here (and would be\ninconsistent with a scale approximately twice as large).\nIt is tempting to consider that we have reached the end of the beginning in the\nexploration of dark energy. Two reliable and independent routes require it in addition to\na third more tentative investigation via the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (Scranton et al.\n2003). SNe Ia continue to provide the most direct route to illuminating dark energy because\ntheir light can be measured propagating from within its era of dominance. Two clues about\ndark energy, its equation of state and its recent time evolution, would be invaluable aids to\ntest and provoke theories. We suggest that the most efficient way forward in the near term\nis by simultaneously mining both ends of the observable redshift range: at z < 1 generally\nfrom the ground, and at z > 1 generally from space. The constraints presented here in the\nw0 \u2212 w \u2032 plane have reduced the allowable range of w \u2032 from a factor of \u223c 10 to <\n\u223c 1 while\nretaining the constraints on w0 within \u22121.4 < w0 < \u22120.7. With continued determination,\nan improvement in precision by a factor of a few in this plane is expected.\n\n6.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWe have conducted the first space-based SN search and follow-up campaign using the\nACS on board HST. The search parameters and the full list of 42 new SNe are provided\nelsewhere (Strolger et al. 2004). We reviewed the sample of SNe Ia harvested from the\nsurvey and examined its cosmological significance. The key results can be summarized as\nfollows.\n(1) We obtained multi-color light curves and spectroscopic redshifts for 16 new SNe Ia\nwhich uniformly sample the redshift range 0.2 < z < 1.6. Twelve of these are classified by\ntheir spectra, 2 from their red, early-type host galaxies, and 2 by photometric diagnostics.\nThree of the SN spectra are at the highest redshifts yet observed for SNe. Six of the SNe Ia\nare among the seven highest-redshift known; all are at z > 1.25. These data provide a\n\n\f\u2013 40 \u2013\nrobust extension of the Hubble diagram to 1 < z < 1.6.\n(2) Utilizing a simple kinematic description of the magnitude-redshift data, we find\nthat the SNe Ia favor recent acceleration and past deceleration at the 99.2% confidence\nlevel. An alternate kinematic parameterization requires a positive jerk (third derivative of\nthe scale factor). The best-fit redshift of the transition between these kinematic phases is\nz = 0.46 \u00b1 0.13, although the precise value depends on the kinematic model employed.\n(3) We have compared the goodness-of-fit of cosmological models and simple models of\nastrophysical dimming. The \"gold\" sample of 157 SNe Ia is consistent with the \"cosmic\nconcordance\" model (\u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7) with \u03c72dof = 1.06. The data reject at highconfidence simple, monotonic models of astrophysical dimming which are tuned to mimic\nthe evidence for acceleration at z \u2248 0.5. These models include either a universe filled with\ngray dust at high redshift, or luminosity evolution \u221d z. More complex parameterizations of\nastrophysical dimming which peak at z \u2248 0.5 and dissipate at z > 1 remain consistent with\nthe SN data (but appear unattractive on other grounds).\n(4) For a flat Universe with a cosmological constant, we measure \u03a9M = 0.29\u00b10.05\n0.03\n(equivalently, \u03a9\u039b = 0.71). When combined with external flat-Universe constraints including\nthe CMB and LSS, we find for the dark-energy equation of state w = \u22121.02\u00b10.13\n0.19 (and\nw < \u22120.76 at the 95% confidence level) for an assumed static equation of state of dark\nenergy, P = w\u03c1c2 .\n(5) Joint constraints on both the recent equation of state of dark energy and its time\nevolution are a factor of \u223c 8 more precise than its first estimate and twice more precise\nthan those derived without the SNe Ia discovered by HST. Both of these dark energy\nproperties are consistent with a cosmological constant (i.e., with w0 = \u22121.0, w \u2032 = 0) and\nare inconsistent with very rapid evolution of dark energy (i.e., |w \u2032| > a few). The absence\nof rapid evolution places constraints on the time in which a simple scalar field could evolve\nto recollapse the Universe. Specifically, the timescale to a potential recollapse is larger\nthan \u223c30 Gyr. If dark energy is evolving towards more negative w, we cannot place any\nmeaningful limit on the minimum time to a (speculative) Big Rip.\nWe wish to thank Richard Hook, Swara Ravindranath, Tomas Dahlen, Peter Garnavich,\nDuilia de Mello, Ed Taylor, Soo Kim, Rafal Idzi, Carl Biagetti, Lexi Moustakas, Marin\nRichardson, Vicki Laidler, Ann Hornschmeier, Ray Lucas, Norman Grogin, Claudia\nKretchmer, Brian Schmidt, Stephane Blondin, and Anton Koekemoer for their help in the\nsupernova search.

There is currently\nno single set of algorithms which are considered by consensus to be the optimal ones.\nRather, different methods may have advantages depending on the breadth and quality of\nthe observational record of any individual SN Ia. In addition, algorithms improve as their\ntraining samples grow. Here we present the full cosmological sample of SNe Ia used in this\nwork in Table 5. Their virtue is that all distance estimates were derived from a single set of\nalgorithms, MLCS2k2 (Jha et al. 2004a), with the broadest set of training data available at\nthis time including U-band data. Additional advantages include a consistent and thorough\nreanalysis of quality criteria for all currently published SNe Ia, an exercise resulting in the\nrejection of many SNe from our \"gold\" sample whose observational records have one or\nmore shortcomings (see \u00a73.1 for discussion).\nThe zeropoint, distance scale, absolute magnitude of the fiducial SN Ia or Hubble\nconstant derived from Table 5 are all closely related (or even equivalent) quantities which\nwere arbitrarily set for the sample presented here. Their correct value is not relevant for\nthe analyses presented which only make use of differences between SN Ia magnitudes. Thus\nthe analysis are independent of the aforementioned normalization parameters.\n\n\f\u2013 42 \u2013\n\nTable 4. \u03c72 Comparison of Gold Set Data to Models\nModel\n\u03a9M = 0.27, \u03a9\u039b = 0.73\n\u03a9M = 1.00, \u03a9\u039b = 0.00\n\u03a9M = 0.00, \u03a9\u039b = 0.00\nHigh-redshift gray dust (with \u03a9M = 1.00, \u03a9\u039b = 0.00)\nReplenishing dust (with \u03a9M = 1.00, \u03a9\u039b = 0.00)\nDimming \u221d z (with \u03a9M = 1.00, \u03a9\u039b = 0.00)\n\n\u03c72 (for 157 SNe Ia)\n178\n325\n192\n307\n175\n253\n\n\f\u2013 43 \u2013\n\nTable 5.

For the SNe Ia discovered in the GOODS fields, the expected\nmagnification was calculated using a multiple-lens plane formalism, with estimates\nof foreground lens redshifts and masses derived from the GOODS catalog. Expected\nmagnifications were also calculated for 100 randomly selected positions (redshift and\nangular position). The solid and dotted lines show redshift bin averages and dispersion,\nrespectively. SNe Ia found in the GOODS survey and in other HST searches are indicated.\nFigure 17: Correlation of the predicted magnification and the best-fit cosmological\nmodel residual for individual SNe Ia. The predicted magnifications are as described in\nFigure 16. The residuals are the difference in distance modulus as predicted from the\nbest-fit model (\u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7) and as observed. The empirical correlation is expected\nto be unity (if the lens light traces their mass) and is shown for the whole sample and\nwithout SN 1997ff, the SN with the largest residual and predicted magnification.\n\n\f\u2013 51 \u2013\nReferences\nAguirre, A.
