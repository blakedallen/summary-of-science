In fact, we exhibit a technology for producing infinitely\nmany such examples.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn automorphism \u03c6 of the free group FN of rank N induces a homeomorphism \u2202\u03c6 of the\n(Gromov) boundary \u2202FN of FN . The dynamics of the map \u2202\u03c6 on \u2202FN has been studied a\nlot, see [13, 14, 15, 16, 10]. We give a survey of the known results relevant in our context in\n\u00a73. In this paper, we focus on the following question:\nDoes there exist an automorphism \u03c6 of FN such that there is a parabolic orbit for the\nhomeomorphism \u2202\u03c6?\nWe say that an automorphism \u03c6 has a parabolic orbit if there exists two points X, Y \u2208\n\u2202FN , X 6= Y , such that:\nlim \u2202\u03c6k (Y ) = X.\nk\u2192\u00b1\u221e\n\nWe note that this implies that X is a fixed point of \u2202\u03c6. In such a situation, the point\nX \u2208 \u2202FN is called a parabolic fixed point for \u03c6, and the set {\u2202\u03c6k (Y ) | k \u2208 Z} is called a\nparabolic orbit for \u03c6. We prove:\nTheorem 1.1. For N > 4 there exists an infinite family {\u03c6k | k \u2208 N} of automorphisms of\n\u2032\nFN which have a parabolic orbit, such that for any k, k \u2032 , p, p\u2032 \u2208 N, \u03c6pk and \u03c6pk\u2032 are conjugated\nif and only if k = k \u2032 and p = p\u2032 .\nLATP - Universit\u00e9 Aix-Marseille 3 - Avenue de l'escadrille Normandie-Ni\u00e9men - 13397 Marseille Cedex\n20 - France \u2013 email: arnaud.hilion@univ.u-3mrs.fr\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\fDiscussions with some of the experts of the subject have led the author to feel that\nthe existence of such parabolic orbits come somehow as a surprise. To put Theorem 1.1 in\nprospective, we would like to mention the following three facts.\nFirst, given a compact set K and a homeomorphism f of K, one says that f has\nNorth-South dynamics, if (i) f has precisely two distinct fixed points x+ and x\u2212 , (ii)\nlimk\u2192+\u221e f k (y) = x+ and limk\u2192+\u221e f \u2212k (y) = x\u2212 for all y \u2208 K r {x\u2212 , x+ }, and (iii) the\nlimit of f k , when k tends to infinity, is uniform on compact subsets of K r {x\u2212 } and the\nlimit of f \u2212k is uniform on compact subsets of K r {x+ }. It is proved in [13] that \"most\"\nautomorphisms of FN , in a precise sense we do not explain here, have North-South dynamics\non \u2202FN . In particular, they can not have a parabolic orbit.\nSecond, let \u03b4 be the automorphism of F2 =< a, b > defined by \u03b4(a) = a and \u03b4(b) = ba.\nThe outer automorphism class D of \u03b4 is sometimes called a Dehn twist automorphism. The\nreader, who has in mind the action by isometries of SL2 (Z) on the hyperbolic plane, should\nbe warned that Dehn twist automorphisms do not give rise to parabolic orbits in \u2202F2 . We\ngive in \u00a76 a description of all possible dynamics of automorphisms of F2 in the outer class\nD n , for n \u2208 Z.\nThird, more generally, it is known that geometric automorphisms of FN do not have\nparabolic orbits in \u2202FN . We recall that an automorphisms \u03c6 of FN is geometric if there\nexist a surface S (with non empty boundary) with fundamental group \u03c01 (S) isomorphic to\nFN and a homeomorphism f of S which induces \u03c6 on FN \u223c\n= \u03c01 (S). More details are given\nin \u00a74.2. As a consequence, since all automorphisms of F2 are known to be geometric, one\nobtains:\nProposition 1.2. There does not exist an automorphism of F2 which has a parabolic orbit.\nTo our knowledge, the question of the existence of automorphisms with a parabolic\norbit is still open for F3 .\nAcknowledgments. I would like to express my gratitude to Gilbert Levitt, who has\nposed the question of the existence of parabolic orbits as part of my thesis project, see[10],\nand has consistently encouraged me to publish my results since then. I would like to thank\nPascal Hubert and Erwan Lanneau for helpful discussions about dilatation coefficients of\nmatrices in SL2 (Z). I am grateful to Martin Lustig for his active interest in the present\npaper.\n\n2\n\nA first example\n\nFor the impatient reader, we give a first example of an automorphism of F4 = < a, b, c, d >\nwith a parabolic orbit \"inside F4 \" (using Proposition 3.5, this gives immediately a parabolic\norbit in \u2202F4 ).\n\n2\n\n\fLet \u03c6 be the automorphism defined by:\n\u03c6: a\nb\nc\nd\n\n7\u2192\n7\u2192\n7\u2192\n7\u2192\n\na\nba\nca2\ndc.\n\nThe inverse of \u03c6 is given by:\n\u03c6\u22121 : a\nb\nc\nd\n\n7\u2192\n7\u2192\n7\u2192\n7\u2192\n\na\nba\u22121\nca\u22122\nda2 c\u22121 .\n\nThe common limit point of the forward and backward iteration of \u03c6 (called a \"parabolic\nfixed point\") will be the element: ba\u2212\u221e = ba\u22121 a\u22121 a\u22121 a\u22121 * * * \u2208 \u2202F4 . The element of F4 which\ngives rise to a parabolic orbit with this limit point is bd\u22121 . We calculate:\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\n\nbd\u22121 7\u2192 bac\u22121 *d\u22121 7\u2192 bc\u22121 *c\u22121 d\u22121 7\u2192 ba\u22121 c\u22121 *a\u22122 c\u22121 c\u22121 d\u22121 7\u2192 ba\u22122 c\u22121 *a\u22124 c\u22121 a\u22122 c\u22121 c\u22121 d\u22121 7\u2192 . . .\n\u03c6\u22121\n\n\u03c6\u22121\n\n\u03c6\u22121\n\n\u03c6\u22121\n\nb * d\u22121 7\u2192 ba\u22121 * ca\u22122 d\u22121 7\u2192 ba\u22122 * ca\u22124 ca\u22122 d\u22121 7\u2192 ba\u22123 * ca\u22126 ca\u22124 ca\u22122 d\u22121 7\u2192 . . .\n\nIn these calculations, we help the reader to follow through the iteration by introducing an\nextra * which is \"mapped\" to the * in the next iteration step. The crucial feature is that at any\nof these * no cancellation does occur. We see that limk\u2192+\u221e \u03c6k (bd\u22121 ) = limk\u2192+\u221e \u03c6\u2212k (bd\u22121 ) =\nba\u2212\u221e . A more formal justification is given in \u00a75.\n\n3\n\nBasics\n\nThis section serves sort of as glossary: We summarize in a sequence of brief subsections\nthe basic definitions and facts which are needed to follow the arguments in the subsequent\nsections. The expert reader is encouraged to skip the first few subsection (and to go back\nlater to them, if need be). However, the terminology introduced in the last subsections is\nnon-standard and should be read carefully.\n\n3.1\n\nThe induced boundary homeomorphism\n\nLet FN denote the free group of finite rank N > 2. The boundary \u2202FN of FN is a Cantor set.\n\u22121\nIf A = {a1 , . . . , aN } is a basis of FN , we denote by A\u00b11 the set {a1 , . . . , aN , a\u22121\n1 , . . . , aN }.\nA word w = w1 . . . wp (wi \u2208 A\u00b11 ) is reduced if wi+1 6= wi\u22121 . The free group FN can be\nunderstood as the set of (finite) reduced words in A\u00b11 . Then the boundary \u2202FN is naturally\nidentified to the set of (right) infinite reduced words X = x1 . . . xp . . . with xi \u2208 A\u00b11 ,\nxi+1 6= x\u22121\ni . The cylinder defined by a reduced word w = w1 . . . wp is the set of right-infinite\nreduced words X = x1 . . . xk . . . which admit w as prefix: xi = wi for i \u2208 {1, . . . , p}. A basis\nof topology of \u2202FN is given by the set of all such cylinders.\n3\n\n\fAn automorphism \u03c6 of a free group FN induces a homeomorphism \u2202\u03c6 of the boundary\n\u2202FN . This can easily be checked by considering a standard set of generators of the automorphisms group Aut(FN ) of FN . Alternatively, this can be seen as a consequence of the\nfact that a quasi-isometry of a proper Gromov-hyperbolic space induces a homeomorphism\non the boundary of this space, see [7]. Indeed, FN equipped with the word metric associated\nto a basis A, is a proper Gromov-0-hyperbolic space, and any automorphism of FN is a\nquasi-isometry of FN with respect to this metric.\n\n3.2\n\nCompactification of FN\n\nLet F N denote the union of FN and its boundary \u2202FN , i.e. F N = FN \u222a \u2202FN . Given a basis\nof FN , if w is a reduced word, let Cw be the set of reduced finite or infinite words which\nhave w as prefix. A basis of topology of F N is given by the finite subsets of FN and the\nsets Cw (with w describing all the reduced words of FN ). Then F N is a compact set, and\nthe inclusions of FN and \u2202FN in F N are embeddings. If \u03c6 is an automorphism of FN , \u03c6 will\ndenote the map defined by \u03c6(g) = \u03c6(g) if g \u2208 FN and \u03c6(X) = \u2202\u03c6(X) if X \u2208 \u2202FN . The map\n\u03c6 is a homeomorphism of F N .\n\n3.3\n\nGetting rid of periodicity\n\nLet f be a homeomorphism of a topological spaceS\nX . We denote by Fix(f ) = {x \u2208 X | f (x) =\nx} the set of fixed points of f , and by Per(f ) = k\u2208N Fix(f k ) the set of periodic points of f .\nLevitt and Lustig have proved in [14] that there exists an integer p, which depends\nonly on the rank N of FN , such that for all \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(FN ), the periodic points of \u03c6p are fixed\npoints: Fix(\u03c6p ) = Per(\u03c6p ). This result has been refined by Feighn and Handel in [5], where\nthe notion of \"forward rotationless\" outer automorphism has been introduced. This lead us\nto say, in this paper, that an automorphism \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(FN ) is rotationless if Fix(\u03c6) = Per(\u03c6).\nThe previously mentioned result can be rephrased as follows:\nTheorem 3.1 (Levitt-Lustig). Any automorphism \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(FN ) has a power \u03c6p (p \u2208 N)\nwhich is rotationless.\n\n3.4\n\nNature of fixed points\n\nLet \u03c6 be a rotationless automorphism of FN . The set Fix(\u03c6) is a subgroup of FN , which is\ncalled the fixed subgroup of \u03c6. This fixed subgroup has finite rank, see [4]. More precisely,\nit is proved in [2] that rank(Fix(\u03c6)) 6 N. In particular, Fix(\u03c6) is a quasiconvex subgroup\nof FN , and thus its boundary \u2202Fix(\u03c6) naturally injects into \u2202FN . By continuity of \u03c6, every\npoint of \u2202Fix(\u03c6) is contained in Fix(\u2202\u03c6). Following Nielsen, these fixed points of \u2202\u03c6 are\ncalled singular ; the fixed points of \u2202\u03c6 which are not singular are called regular.\nA fixed point X of \u2202\u03c6 is attracting if there exists a neighbourhood U of X in F N such\nthat the sequence \u03c6k (x) converges to X for all x in U. A fixed point X of \u2202\u03c6 is repulsing if\nit is attracting for \u2202\u03c6\u22121 . It is proved in [6] that:\n4\n\n\fLemma 3.2. Let \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(FN ). A regular fixed point of \u2202\u03c6 is either attracting or repulsing.\nHowever, outside of the regular fixed point set, i.e. for singular fixed points, the\ndynamics can be quite a bit more complicated. In particular, there may exist mixed fixed\npoints, i.e. fixed points which serve as attractor for some orbits, and simultaneously as\nrepeller for others. This phenomenon is rather common; some concrete examples will be\nspelled out in the subsequent sections.\nA particular case of a mixed fixed point is the case (defined in the Introduction) of a\nparabolic fixed point. Thus we obtain as special case the following consequence of Lemma\n3.2:\nRemark 3.3. Any parabolic fixed point of \u03c6 is singular.\n\n3.5\n\nLimit points\n\nLet \u03c6 be a rotationless automorphism of FN . For any x \u2208 F N , if the limit limk\u2192+\u221e \u03c6k (x)\nexists, we denote it by \u03c9\u03c6 (x). In [16], Levitt and Lustig have proved:\nTheorem 3.4 (Levitt-Lustig). Let \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(FN ) be rotationless. Then for any x \u2208 F N the\nsequence \u03c6k (x) converges to some element \u03c9\u03c6 (x) \u2208 Fix(\u03c6).\nA point X \u2208 \u2202Fix(\u03c6) is a \u03c9-limit point of \u03c6 if there exists x \u2208 F N such that X = \u03c9\u03c6 (x).\nA point X \u2208 \u2202Fix(\u03c6) is a limit point of \u03c6 if it is a \u03c9-limit point of \u03c6 or \u03c6\u22121 . Let L\u03c9\u03c6 denote\nthe set of \u03c9-limit points of \u03c6 and let L\u03c6 denote the set of limit points of \u03c6.\nFor any g \u2208 FN , g 6= 1, the sequence g k has a limit in \u2202FN when k \u2192 +\u221e: this limit\nis denoted by g \u221e .\nProposition 3.5. Let \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(FN ) be a rotationless automorphism. If g \u2208 FN r Fix(\u03c6),\nthen:\n\u03c9\u03c6 (g) = \u03c9\u03c6 (g \u221e ).\nProof. The proof is a simple adaptation of the arguments in the proof of [13, Proposition\n2.3]. We fix a basis A of FN . We note that for all g \u2208 FN r {1}, the Gromov product (g, g \u221e)\n(i.e. the length of longest common prefix) of g and g \u221e is bigger than 21 (|g| + 1) (where\n|g| denotes the length of g in the basis A). If g \u2208\n/ Fix(\u03c6), then the length of \u03c6k (g), and\nk\nk\n\u221e\nthus also the Gromov product (\u03c6 (g), (\u03c6 (g)) ), tend to infinity. Theorem 3.4 implies that\n\u03c9\u03c6 (g) = \u03c9\u03c6 (g \u221e ).\nL\u03c9\u03c6\n\nProposition 3.5 shows that L\u03c9\u03c6 = {\u03c9\u03c6 (X) | X \u2208 \u2202FN }. We do not know whether\n= {\u03c9\u03c6 (g) | g \u2208 FN } holds.\n\n5\n\n\f3.6\n\nIsoglossy classes\n\nFor any \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(FN ), two points X, Y \u2208 \u2202FN are called isogloss (with respect to \u03c6)\nif there exists some g \u2208 Fix(\u03c6) such that X = gY . It follows directly from this definition that isoglossy is an equivalence relation. The fixed subgroup Fix(\u03c6) acts naturally\non the fixed point set Fix(\u2202\u03c6), which is thus naturally partitioned into isoglossy classes. If\nX, Y \u2208 Fix(\u2202\u03c6) are isogloss, then they are of same \"dynamical type\": they are simultaneously\nsingular, attracting, repulsing, mixed, parabolic or limit points.\n\n3.7\n\nDynamics graph\n\nLet \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(FN ) be a rotationless automorphism. We associate to \u03c6 a graph \u0393\u03c6 , called the\ndynamics graph of \u03c6. The vertices of \u0393\u03c6 are the isoglossy classes of points of L\u03c6 . There\nis an oriented edge from the isoglossy class x1 to the isoglossy class x2 if there exists some\nrepresentatives Xi of xi and X \u2208 \u2202FN such that \u03c9\u03c6\u22121 (X) = X1 and \u03c9\u03c6 (X) = X2 . The main\ntheorem of [10] states that \u0393\u03c6 is a finite graph. We give in Figure 1 the dynamics graph of\nan automorphism which has North-South dynamics on \u2202FN .\n\u2022\n\u000f\n\n\u2022\nFigure 1: North-South dynamics graph\nFinally, we note that, for a rotationless automorphism \u03c6, the existence of parabolic\norbit is equivalent to the fact that there is an edge of the dynamics graph \u0393\u03c6 which is a loop.\nRemark 3.6. In [11] G. Levitt introduces a graph in order to code the dynamics of so-called\n\"simple-dynamics homeomorphisms\" of the Cantor set C: a homeomorphism f : C \u2192 C\nhas simple dynamics if the set Fix(f ) of its fixed points is finite, and if the sequence f n\nuniformly converges on any compact set disjoint from Fix(f ). If \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(FN ) is a rotationless\nautomorphism with trivial fixed subgroup, then \u2202\u03c6p has simple dynamics, and the graph \u0393\u03c6\nis the same as the one defined in [11]. In this case, the fixed points of \u2202\u03c6 are either attracting\nor repulsing. Thus, if one is interested in parabolic orbits, which are the main focus of the\npresent paper, one has to purposefully leave to world of \"simple dynamics\" homeomorphisms.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nExamples\nInner automorphisms\n\nLet iu \u2208 Aut(FN ) denote the conjugation, or inner automorphism, by u \u2208 FN , i.e. iu (g) =\nugu\u22121 for all g \u2208 FN . The set Inn(FN ) of inner automorphisms of FN is a normal subgroup\n6\n\n\fof Aut(FN ). The quotient group, denoted by Out(FN ), is the group of outer automorphisms\nof FN .\nThe homeomorphism \u2202iu : \u2202FN \u2192 \u2202FN induced by iu is the left translation by u:\n\u2202iu (X) = uX. If u 6= 1, the map \u2202iu has precisely 2 fixed points: u\u221e and u\u2212\u221e (where u\u221e\nis the limit of the sequence uk , and u\u2212\u221e is is the limit of the sequence u\u2212k , for k \u2192 +\u221e).\nMoreover, for any point X \u2208 \u2202FN different from u\u2212\u221e , the sequence \u2202\u03c6k (X) converges to\nu\u221e when k tends to infinity. One checks easily that the map \u2202iu has North-South dynamics,\nfrom u\u2212\u221e to u\u221e , on \u2202FN , see [13] for instance.\nRemark 4.1. We note that the fixed subgroup of iu is cyclic, generated by the root of u (i.e.\nthe element v \u2208 FN such that u = v p with p \u2208 N maximal). In particular, u\u221e and u\u2212\u221e are\nsingular fixed points of iu . This shows that when defining \"X is an attracting fixed point\nof \u03c6\" in \u00a73.4, it makes a crucial difference that we request the neighbourhood U of X to be\ntaken in F N and not just in \u2202FN .\n\n4.2\n\nGeometric automorphisms\n\nLet \u03a3 be a compact surface with fundamental group \u03c01 (\u03a3) isomorphic to FN (in particular,\n\u03a3 has non empty boundary). The surface \u03a3 can be equipped with a hyperbolic metric (i.e.\na metric of constant curvature equal to \u22121) in such a way that every boundary component\nof the boundary of \u03a3 is a geodesic. The universal cover \u03a3\u0303 of \u03a3 is then identified with a\nclosed convex subset of the hyperbolic plane H2 , and the Gromov boundary \u2202 \u03a3\u0303 of \u03a3\u0303, which\nis naturally identified with the boundary \u2202FN of FN , injects in the boundary (or circle at\ninfinity) S\u221e of H2 . Since S\u221e is a circle, it can be equipped with a natural cyclic order. This\norder on S\u221e induces a cyclic order on \u2202FN .\nIn his fundamental work [19, 20, 21], Nielsen proposed an original and fruitful point\nof view to study homeomorphisms of surfaces. The basic idea is that the behaviour of a\nhomeomorphism f of a surface \u03a3 is well reflected by the collection of all the lifts f \u0303 of f to\n\u03a3\u0303 which have each much simpler individual behaviour. This idea is at the origin of what is\nnow called \"Nielsen-Thurston classification\" of homeomorphisms of surfaces, see [9], and it\nhas much influenced the study of (outer) automorphisms of free groups, see [6, 5, 8]. The\nkey fact is that any lift f \u0303 of f induces a homeomorphism \u2202 f \u0303 of \u2202 \u03a3\u0303. A basic (but rather\nfundamental) remark is that \u2202 f \u0303 preserves the cyclic order on \u2202 \u03a3\u0303 \u2286 S\u221e .\nAn homeomorphism f of \u03a3 induces an outer automorphism of \u03c01 (\u03a3), and thus an\nouter automorphism \u03a6 \u2208 Out(FN ) (in fact, this outer automorphism \u03a6 only depends on the\nmapping class of f ). Such an outer automorphism \u03a6 of FN (and also any automorphism\n\u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6) is called geometric. Classical Galois theory for covering spaces states that the lifts\nof f are in bijective correspondance with the automorphisms in the outer class \u03a6. More\nprecisely, an automorphism \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 and a lift f \u0303 of f are in correspondance if, and only if,\n\u03c6(g) \u25e6 f \u0303 = f \u0303 \u25e6 g \u2200g \u2208 FN ,\n\nwhere the elements of FN are considered as deck transformations of \u03a3\u0303. As a consequence,\nthe dynamics of \u2202 f \u0303 on \u2202 \u03a3\u0303 and the dynamics of \u2202\u03c6 on \u2202FN are conjugated via the natural\nidentification between \u2202 \u03a3\u0303 and \u2202FN .\n7\n\n\fIt follows from the previous discussion that, for any geometric automorphism \u03c6 \u2208\nAut(FN ), the homeomorphism \u2202\u03c6 of \u2202FN must preserve a cyclic order on \u2202FN .\nAnother fact proved by Nielsen is that \u2202 f \u0303 has at least 2 periodic points on \u2202FN (for a\nproof in the context of free groups, see [14]). This means that there exists a positive power\nof \u2202 f \u0303 which has at least 2 fixed points on \u2202FN . Both these facts (existence of 2 fixed points\nand preservation of a cyclic order) yield directly:\nProposition 4.2. A geometric automorphism of FN can not have a parabolic orbit in \u2202FN .\nThis fact is particularly meaningful for the free group of rank 2. Indeed, it is well\nknown that any outer automorphism of F2 can be induced by a homeomorphism of a torus\nwith one boundary component, see [18]. This is precisely how Proposition 1.2 is proved.\n\n4.3\n\nOuter automorphisms\n\nAlthough well known, we believe that at this point it might be wise to alert the less expert\nreader about a common misunderstanding. It is by no means true that any two automorphisms \u03c6, \u03c6\u2032 which belong to the same outer automorphism class \u03a6, must have conjugated\ndynamics. Indeed, their dynamics graphs \u0393\u03c6 and \u0393\u03c6\u2032 may look quite different. Concrete\nexamples are easy to come by, and some are given in the subsequent sections.\nThe reader who wants to be more subtle can easily check that indeed some automorphisms in \u03a6 have naturally conjugated dynamics. The resulting isogredience classes go again\nall the way back to Nielsen (see also [13]), and one could associate to \u03a6 a total dynamics graph\nwhich is the disjoint union of the \u0393\u03c6 over a set of representatives for the single isogredience\nclasses. However, this goes beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nParabolic orbits\nStructure of a parabolic fixed point\n\nLet \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(FN ) be an automorphism, and X \u2208 Fix(\u2202\u03c6) be a parabolic fixed point for \u03c6.\nWe have seen (cf Remark 3.3) that X must be singular. A point X \u2208 \u2202FN is rational if it a\nfixed point of an inner automorphism, i.e. X = u\u221e for some u \u2208 FN r {1}. It is proved in\n[10] that singular limit points of \u03c6 are rational. We deduce the following:\nLemma 5.1. A parabolic fixed point X of \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(FN ) is a singular rational point: X = u\u221e\nwith u \u2208 Fix(\u03c6).\nMoreover, we have:\nProposition 5.2. Let \u03c6 be an automorphisme of FN , and X \u2208 Fix(\u2202\u03c6) be a parabolic fixed\npoint for \u03c6. Then any neighborhood of X in \u2202FN contains a full orbit {\u2202\u03c6k (Y ) | k \u2208 Z} \u2282\n\u2202FN\n\n8\n\n\fProof. We have seen that X = u\u221e , with u \u2208 Fix(\u03c6). We consider a given neighborhood\nV of X. Let \u03b8 = {\u2202\u03c6k (Y )) | k \u2208 Z} be a parabolic orbit for X. We note that \u03b8 \u222a {X}\nis a compact subset of \u2202FN . Moreover, u\u2212\u221e \u2208\n/ \u03b8 \u222a {X} because Y \u2208\n/ Fix(\u2202\u03c6). Since the\nsequence (\u2202ipu )p\u2208N uniformly converges on compact subsets of \u2202FN r{u\u2212\u221e } towards u\u221e when\np tends to infinity, see \u00a74.1, the set \u2202ipu (\u03b8) is contained in V, up to taking p sufficiently large.\nWe remark that, since u \u2208 Fix(\u03c6), \u2202ipu (\u2202\u03c6k (Y )) = \u2202\u03c6k (up Y ), and thus \u2202ipu (\u03b8) = up \u03b8 is a\nparabolic orbit for X.\n\n5.2\n\nAutomorphisms of F4 which have parabolic orbits\n\nFor any k \u2208 N, consider the automorphism \u03c6k of F4 =< a, b, c, d > given by:\n\u03c6k : a\nb\nc\nd\nand its inverse:\n\n\u03c6\u22121\nk : a\nb\nc\nd\n\n7\n\u2192\n7\u2192\n7\n\u2192\n7\u2192\n7\u2192\n7\u2192\n7\u2192\n7\u2192\n\na\nba\ncak+1\ndc\na\nba\u22121\nca\u2212k\u22121\ndak+1 c\u22121\n\nThe rose R4 is the geometric realization of graph with one vertex and 4 edges. We put\nan orientation on each edge, and we label them by a, b, c and d. We can turn R4 into a\nlength space by declaring that each edge has length 1. As usual, the automorphisms \u03c6\u00b11\nk can\n\u00b1\nbe realized as homotopy equivalences fk of the rose R4 where each edge is mapped linearly\nto the edge path with label preassigned by \u03c6\u00b11\nk .\n\u00b11\nIn fact, the automorphisms \u03c6k define outer automorphisms which are unipotent polynomially growing in the sense of [1], and the maps fk+ satisfy the conclusions of Theorem\n5.1.8 of [1]. We do not quote here the statement of this theorem, which would lead us to\nintroduce a lot of technical background, but we freely use in the sequel some consequences\nof it.\nLet A be a basis of FN . We denote by [g] the reduced word, in the basis A, representing\nthe element g \u2208 FN . Let \u03c6 be an automorphism of FN . A splitting of g \u2208 FN for \u03c6 is a way\nto write g = g1 . . . gn such that:\n(i) n > 2,\n(ii) for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, gi \u2208 FN r {1},\n(iii) for all p \u2208 N, for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 1}, [\u03c6p (gi )][\u03c6p (gi+1 )] = [\u03c6p (gi gi+1 )] (this means that\nno cancellation occurs between [\u03c6p (gi )] and [\u03c6p (gi+1 )]).\nIn that case, we note g = g1 * . . . * gn , and each gi is called a brick of the splitting.\nWe now apply that Theorem 5.1.8 of [1] to the given family \u03c6k and obtain:\n9\n\n\fLemma 5.3. For all g \u2208 F4 , there exists some p0 \u2208 N such that for all p > p0 , [\u03c6pk (g)] and\n[\u03c6\u2212p\nk (g)] have a splitting, the bricks of which are either edges or paths of the following labels:\nbaq b\u22121 , caq c\u22121 , baq c\u22121 or caq b\u22121 , for some q \u2208 Z.\nRemark 5.4. For the reader who is familiar with the terminology of [1], the edge paths labelled\nby baq b\u22121 , caq c\u22121 , baq c\u22121 or caq b\u22121 are precisely the exceptional paths of the improved traintrack map fk .\nAs a consequence of Lemma 5.3, one can easily check that the sequence (|[\u03c6pk (g)]|)p\u2208N\nof lengths of [\u03c6pk (g)] is bounded above by a polynomial of degree 2 in p.\nIt is claimed in [17] that there exists a general algorithm to compute the fixed subgroup\nof a given automorphism of FN . There exist some easier algorithms for special cases: for\ninstance, one could use [3] to compute the fixed subgroup of \u03c6k . In fact, it is sufficient to\ndetermines the so called indivisible Nielsen paths, see [2]: using Lemma 5.3, we find that\nFix(\u03c6k ) = < a, bab\u22121 , cac\u22121 >.\nTheorem 5.5. The set {\u03c6k | k \u2208 N} is a family of automorphisms of F4 , such that each \u03c6k\nhas a parabolic\norbit. The dynamics graph of \u03c6k is given in Figure 2. For any k, k \u2032 , p, p\u2032 \u2208 N,\np\np\u2032\n\u03c6k and \u03c6k\u2032 are conjugated if and only if k = k \u2032 and p = p\u2032 .\nb\n\nbd\u22121\n\n\u001c\n\nba+\u221e\n\nba= \u2212\u221e\nZ\nbc\u22121\n\nXk+ o\n\nd\n\nXk\u2212\n\na+\u221e\n\nb\u22121\n\n/\n\na\u2212\u221e o\n\nd\u22121\n\nca\u2212\u221e\n\nc\n\n/\n\nca+\u221e\n\nFigure 2: The dynamics graph of \u03c6k has 3 connected components. A label g has been added\nto each edge: it means that \u03c9k (g) is the endpoint of the edge and \u03c9k\u2212 (g) is the origin of the\nedge. (The terminology used here is given in the proof below.)\n\nProof. For simplicity, we write \u03c9\u03c6k = \u03c9k and \u03c9\u03c6\u22121 = \u03c9k\u2212 . Using Lemma 5.3, we check\nk\nthat \u03c6k has only one isoglossy class of attracting fixed points: a representative is given by\nXk+ = \u03c9k (d) = dccak+1 ca2k+2 ca3k+3 . . . Likewise \u03c6k has only one isoglossy class of repulsing\nfixed points: a representative is given by Xk\u2212 = \u03c9k\u2212 (d) = dak+1c\u22121 a2k+2 c\u22121 a3k+3 c\u22121 . . .\nLemma 5.3 also gives:\n\u2022 \u03c9k (b\u22121 ) = \u03c9k (c\u22121 ) = \u03c9k (d\u22121 ) = a\u2212\u221e ,\n\u2022 \u03c9k (c) = ca+\u221e ,\n\u2022 \u03c9k (b) = ba+\u221e ,\n10\n\n\f\u2022 \u03c9k (bc\u22121 ) = ba\u2212\u221e ,\n\u2022 \u03c9k\u2212 (b\u22121 ) = \u03c9k\u2212 (c\u22121 ) = a+\u221e ,\n\u2022 \u03c9k\u2212 (c) = \u03c9k\u2212 (d\u22121 ) = ca\u2212\u221e ,\n\u2022 \u03c9k\u2212 (b) = ba\u2212\u221e ,\n\u2022 \u03c9k\u2212 (bc\u22121 ) = ba+\u221e .\nIn fact, one can see that there are only 5 isoglossy classes in L\u03c9\u03c6k (given by Xk+ , a\u2212\u221e , ca+\u221e ,\nba+\u221e , ba\u2212\u221e ) and 5 isoglossy classes in L\u03c9\u03c6\u22121 (given by Xk\u2212 , a+\u221e , ca\u2212\u221e , ba\u2212\u221e , ba+\u221e ).\nk\n\nNote that \u03c6k (bd\u22121 ) = bac\u22121 * d\u22121 is a splitting for \u03c6k . Hence \u03c9k (bd\u22121 ) = \u03c9k (bac\u22121 ) =\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\u221e\n\u22121\n\u2212\u221e\nba . On the other hand, b * d\u22121 is a splitting for \u03c6\u22121\n.\nk . Hence \u03c9k (bd ) = \u03c9k (b) = ba\nThus ba\u2212\u221e is parabolic fixed point for \u03c6k .\n\u2032\nSuppose that \u03c6pk and \u03c6pk\u2032 are conjugated (k, k \u2032 , p, p\u2032 \u2208 N): there exists \u03c8 \u2208 Aut(F4 ) such\n\u2032\nthat \u03c6pk = \u03c8\u03c6pk\u2032 \u03c8 \u22121 .

From (1) we\nderive k = k \u2032 and p = p\u2032 .\n\n5.3\n\nParabolic orbits for N > 5\n\nFor any k \u2208 N, consider the automorphism \u03b1k of F5 =< a, b, c, d, e > given by:\n\u03b1k : a\nb\nc\nd\ne\n\n7\u2192\na\n7\n\u2192\nba\n7\n\u2192\ncak+1\n7\u2192 dc\n7\u2192\ne\n11\n\n\fSince the restriction of \u03b1k to < a, b, c, d > is \u03c6k , it is clear that \u03c9\u03b1k (bd\u22121 ) = \u03c9\u03b1\u22121 (bac\u22121 ) =\nk\nba\u2212\u221e is a parabolic fixed point for \u03b1k . Considering the abelianization and arguing as previ\u2032\nously, we check that if k 6= k \u2032 and p 6= p\u2032 , then \u03b1kp and \u03b1kp\u2032 can not be conjugated.\nIf N > 6, we split FN = F4 \u2217 F2 \u2217 FN \u22126 . We first recall some facts about Out(F2 ). It is\nwell known, since Nielsen [18], that the abelianisation morphism from Out(F2 ) to GL2 (Z) is\nan isomorphism. If M \u2208 SL2 (Z) has a trace bigger than 2, then M has an eigenvalue \u03bb > 1\nwhich is an algebraic unity of a quadratic extension of Q: we call \u03bb the dilatation of M.\nFor all\u221ak \u2208 N prime, there exists Mk \u2208 SL2 (Z) such that the dilatation\n\u221a \u03bbk of Mk belongs\np\nto Q( k) r Q. This implies in particular that for all p \u2208 N, \u03bbk \u2208 Q( k) r Q. We choose\n\u03b8k \u2208 Aut(F2 ) in the outer class represented by Mk . Then the automorphism \u03b8kp has growth\nrate equal to \u03bbpk .\nWe define \u03b2k \u2208 Aut(FN ) by \u03b2k = \u03c61 \u2217 \u03b8k \u2217 id, where id is the identity on FN \u22126 . Again,\n\u03c9\u03b2k (bd\u22121 ) = \u03c9\u03b2 \u22121 (bac\u22121 ) = ba\u2212\u221e is a parabolic fixed point for \u03b2k . Since \u03c61 is polynomially\nk\ngrowing, it follows that the growth rate of \u03b2kp is \u03bbpk (see for instance [12]). This proves that \u03b2kp\np\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nis not conjugated\nto\n\u03b2\n\u2032 if k 6= k or p 6= p , because the growth rate is a conjugacy invariant\nk\n\u221a\n\u221a\nand because Q( k) \u2229 Q( k \u2032 ) = Q (if k and k \u2032 are prime integers).\nThis finishes the proof Theorem 1.1. In view of Proposition 1.2, it remains to ask the\nfollowing question, the answer of which we do not know:\nQuestion 5.6. Does there exist an automorphism of F3 which has a parabolic orbit?\n\n6\n\nDehn twist automorphisms of F2\n\nIn this last section, we calculate the dynamics graphs of all the automorphisms in the outer\nclass of \u03b4 n (n \u2208 Z, n 6= 0), where \u03b4 is the automorphism of F2 =< a, b > defined by \u03b4(a) = a\nand \u03b4(b) = ba.\nLet D \u2208 Out(F2 ) be the outer class of \u03b4. As explained in \u00a74.2, the automorphisms in\nthe outer class D n (n \u2208 Z) can not have parabolic orbits. We are going to describe more\nprecisely the dynamics induced on \u2202FN by the automorphisms in the outer class D n (n \u2208 Z,\nn 6= 0). For that, we pursue the strategy of [6, 13], where the interested reader will be able\nto find details of the following constructions.\nThe rose R2 is the geometric realization of the graph with one vertex and 2 edges.\nWe put an orientation on each edge, and we label them by a and b. We can turn R2 in a\nlength space by declaring that each edge has length 1. We represent D n by an homotopy\nequivalence f of R2 defined in the following way: f is the identity on the edge a and linearly\nsends the edge b to the edge path labelled ban .\ne2 of R2 is a tree, equipped by the action of F2 by deck transforThe universal cover R\ne2 . Equivalently, R\ne2 can be\nmations. We lift the labels of the edges of R2 to the edges of R\nconsidered as the Cayley graph of F2 relative to the generating set {a, b}. Let T be the tree\ne2 all the edges labelled by a: the action of FN on R\ne2 induces an\nobtained by contracting in R\naction of F2 on T by isometries. We note that the stabilizer of a vertex of T is conjugated\nto the subgroup < a > \u2282 FN generated by a.\n12\n\n\fAs in the geometric case (see \u00a74.2) the automorphisms in the outer class D n are in 1:1\ne2 . Moreover, these lifts of f induce isometries of T .\ncorrespondance with the lifts of f to R\nMore precisely, the isometry H of T associated to the automorphism \u03b4 n \u2208 D n satisfies\n\u03b4 n (g) \u25e6 H = H \u25e6 g\n\n\u2200g \u2208 FN ,\n\nwhere the elements of FN are considered as isometries of T . Then, for u \u2208 FN , the map\nHu = u \u25e6 H is the isometry of T associated to the automorphism iu \u25e6 \u03b4 n \u2208 D n , since\n(iu \u25e6 \u03b4 n )(g) \u25e6 Hu = Hu \u25e6 g holds for all g \u2208 FN .\nIf Hu is a hyperbolic isometry of T , then iu \u25e6 \u03b4 n has North-South dynamics and the\nfixed points of iu \u25e6 \u03b4 n are determined by the ends of the axis of Hu in T , see [13].\nIf Hu is an elliptic isometry, let P \u2208 T be a fixed point of Hu . There exists some\nw \u2208 FN such that the stabilizer of P in FN is w < a > w \u22121 . The fact that P is a fixed\npoint of Hu then results in the existence of an integer k \u2208 Z such that u\u03b4 n (w) = wak . Or\nequivalently, such that iu \u25e6 \u03b4 n = iw \u25e6 (iak \u25e6 \u03b4 n ) \u25e6 i\u22121\nw . Indeed,\niu \u25e6 \u03b4 n =\n=\n=\n=\n\niwak (\u03b4n (w))\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b4 n\niwak \u03b4n (w\u22121 ) \u25e6 \u03b4 n\niw \u25e6 iak \u25e6 i\u03b4n (w\u22121 ) \u25e6 \u03b4 n\niw \u25e6 iak \u25e6 \u03b4 n \u25e6 iw\u22121 .\n\nThe dynamics of \u2202(iu \u25e6 \u03b4 n ) is thus conjugated to the dynamics of \u2202(iak \u25e6 \u03b4 n ) for some k \u2208 Z.\nWe are now going to study in more detail the automorphisms iak \u25e6 \u03b4 n for k \u2208 Z, and in\nparticular, to give their dynamics graphs.\nThe inverse of iak \u25e6 \u03b4 n is ia\u2212k \u25e6 \u03b4 \u2212n . We note that:\niak \u25e6 \u03b4 n :\n\na 7\u2192 a\nb 7\u2192 ak ban\u2212k\n\u22121\nb\n7\u2192 ak\u2212n b\u22121 a\u2212k\n\nia\u2212k \u25e6 \u03b4 \u2212n :\n\na \u2192\n7\na\nb \u2192\n7\na\u2212k bak\u2212n\n\u22121\nb\n7\u2192 an\u2212k b\u22121 ak .\n\nThus the dynamics of \u2202(iak2 \u25e6 \u03b4 n ) depends on the sign of k and of n \u2212 k.\n\nRemark 6.1. Let \u03c3 \u2208 Aut(FN ) defined by \u03c3(a) = a\u22121 and \u03c3(b) = b\u22121 . We note that iak \u25e6 \u03b4 n\nand ian\u2212k \u25e6 \u03b4 n are conjugated by the involution \u03c3.\n\nFirst case: Assume k(n \u2212 k) = 0. Since \u03b4 n and ian \u25e6 \u03b4 n are conjugated by \u03c3 (see Remark\n6.1), we focus on \u03b4 n . One can check that Fix(\u03b4 n ) =< a, bab\u22121 >. Let X be a point in\n\u2202F2 r \u2202 < a, bab\u22121 >, and let x be the longest prefix of X in < a, bab\u22121 >. Then X = xY ,\nwith no cancellation between x and Y , and the first letter of Y is equal to b or to b\u22121 . If Y\nbegins by b, then \u03c9\u03b4n (Y ) = ba\u221e and \u03c9\u03b4\u2212n (Y ) = ba\u2212\u221e . If Y begins by b\u22121 , then \u03c9\u03b4n (Y ) = a\u2212\u221e\nand \u03c9\u03b4\u2212n (Y ) = a\u221e . Hence \u03b4 n has 2 isoglossy classes of \u03c9-limit points (with representatives\nba\u221e and a\u2212\u221e ), and \u03b4 \u2212n has 2 isoglossy classes of \u03c9-limit points (with representatives ba\u2212\u221e\nand a\u221e ). The dynamics graph of \u03b4 n is given in Figure 3.\nSecond case: k(n \u2212 k) < 0. We suppose that k > n (from which one deduces the case\nk < 0 by using Remark 6.1). The fixed subgroup is Fix(iak \u25e6 \u03b4 n ) = < a >.

It follows that\n\u2202(iak \u25e6 \u03b4 n ) has North-South dynamics on \u2202F2 , see Figure 4.\nThird case: k(n \u2212 k) > 0, i.e. 0 < k < n. We check that the fixed subgroup is equal to\nFix(iak \u25e6\u03b4 n ) = < a >. We note that \u03c9iak \u25e6\u03b4n (b) = a\u221e , \u03c9iak \u25e6\u03b4n (b\u22121 ) = a\u2212\u221e , \u03c9(iak \u25e6\u03b4n )\u22121 (b) = a\u2212\u221e\nand \u03c9(iak \u25e6\u03b4n )\u22121 (b\u22121 ) = a\u221e . For x \u2208 \u2202F2 , it follows that \u03c9iak \u25e6\u03b4n (X) and \u03c9(iak \u25e6\u03b4n )\u22121 (X) depend\nonly on the first occurence of the letter b or b\u22121 in X: if it is b, then \u03c9iak \u25e6\u03b4n (X) = a\u221e and\n\u03c9(iak \u25e6\u03b4n )\u22121 (X) = a\u2212\u221e ; if it is b\u22121 , then \u03c9iak \u25e6\u03b4n (X) = a\u2212\u221e and \u03c9(iak \u25e6\u03b4n )\u22121 (X) = a\u221e . We say\nthat \u2202(iak \u25e6 \u03b4 n ) has semi-North-South dynamics on \u2202F2 , see Figure 5.\naC \u2212\u221e\na\u221e\n\n\u0002\n\nFigure 5: Dynamics graph of iak \u25e6 \u03b4 n for k(n \u2212 k) > 0.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
