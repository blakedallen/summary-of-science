Figure 1 displays an r\u2013band image of the\nsystem from the Chengalur\u2013Nordgren galaxy survey (Nordgren et al. 1997). From a comparison of the observed tidal features of the system with galaxy encounter simulations, Kaufman\net al. (1999a) (hereafter Paper I) concluded that NGC 5394, the smaller member of the pair,\nsuffered a close prograde collision with NGC 5395 and is in an immediate post\u2013ocular (post\neye-shaped) phase. NGC 5394 has a central starburst, 3.\u2032\u2032 5 (= 800 pc) in diameter, very\nbright inner-disk spiral arms (R = 4\u2032\u2032 \u2212 13\u2032\u2032 = 0.9 \u2013 3.0 kpc from the nucleus), and two long,\nopen tidal arms, with the tidal tail extending to R = 80\u2032\u2032 . Its disk is intrinsically oval. Some\nproperties of NGC 5394 are listed in Table 1. The dominant spiral arm of its companion,\nNGC 5395, forms a large ring or pseudo-ring of H\u03b1, radio continuum, and HI emission. The\neastern half of the ring is the brighter side in radio continuum and H\u03b1, whereas the western\nhalf is the brighter side in HI.\nNGC 5394/95 is one of three galaxy pairs that we have studied previously with radio,\noptical, and single\u2013dish CO observations and numerical simulations to see how structures\nresulting from prograde, in\u2013plane, grazing encounters develop. The other two systems are\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nIC 2163/NGC 2207 (Elmegreen et al. 1995a,b, 2000, 2001) and NGC 2535/36 (Kaufman et\nal. 1997). In the models, the response of the galaxy disk to the cos 2\u03b8 tidal potential of\nthe prograde encounter produces an eye\u2013shaped (\"ocular\") oval like that seen in IC 2163\nand NGC 2535. This can subsequently evolve into inner\u2013disk arms, similar to those visible\nin NGC 5394. From a comparison of the observed morphologies with the models, Paper I\nconcluded that the galaxies IC 2163, NGC 2535, and NGC 5394 form an \"age\" sequence with\nIC 2163 the least evolved interaction and NGC 5394, the most evolved one. IC 2163 has star\nformation typical of normal spiral disks (Elmegreen et al. 2001), NGC 2535 has somewhat\nenhanced star formation (Bernl\u00f6hr 1993) with the brightest H\u03b1 emission at the two ends of\nthe eye\u2013shaped oval (Amram et al. 1989), and NGC 5394 has a central starburst.\nWe present 12 CO J = 1 \u2192 0 observations of NGC 5394/95 taken with the Berkeley\u2013\nIllinois\u2013Maryland Association (BIMA)9 array to examine the distribution of molecular gas,\nparticularly in the inner\u2013disk arms and starburst nucleus of NGC 5394 and in the ring/pseudoring of NGC 5395.\nThe inner\u2013disk arms of NGC 5394 present a puzzle for models of star formation. These\nbright arms are mostly free of star-formation knots (Arp 1969; Wray 1988), and only one\nof the three arms is clearly detected in H\u03b1 (Paper I). This is unusual, since high surface\nbrightness in a spiral arm is almost always the result of ongoing star formation. Wray (1988)\ndescribed these arms as extremely bright spiral arcs that are \"mostly smooth and green.\"\nDespite the presence of HI gas, two of these arms show no evidence of star formation in\nprogress. Paper I offered the following interpretation. If molecular gas can be ignored, the\ninstability parameter Qgas > 10, which is too high for significant star formation; Kennicutt\n(1989) and Martin & Kennicutt (2001) found that Qgas \u2264 1.4 for star\u2013forming regions in\nlate\u2013type spirals. A value for Qgas based simply on HI may be too high if a significant amount\nof molecular gas, which can lower the value of Qgas , is present. Thus we needed to measure\nthe molecular surface density at the inner\u2013disk arms of NGC 5394. Single\u2013dish observations\nwith the NRAO 12\u2013m telescope at a resolution of 55\u2032\u2032 (Zhu et al. 1999) and with Onsala\nSpace Observatory at a resolution of 33\u2032\u2032 (Paper I) detected significant CO emission from\nNGC 5394. In particular, the Onsala observations found a lot of 12 CO J = 1 \u2192 0 emission\n(129 Jy km s\u22121 ) in the field containing the starburst nucleus and the inner\u2013disk spiral arms\nbut did not have sufficient spatial resolution to distinguish between emission from the nuclear\nregion and that from the inner\u2013disk arms (Paper I). The 5 times higher resolution (\u223c 6.\u2032\u2032 5) of\nthe BIMA 12 CO J = 1 \u2192 0 observations presented here allows us to make this distinction.\nOptical spectroscopy by Arp (1969) and Leech et al. (1989) and near\u2013infrared spec9\n\nThe BIMA array is partially funded by grant AST\u20139981289 from the National Science Foundation\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ntroscopy by Vanzi, Alonso\u2013Herrero, & Rieke (1998) revealed a young starburst in the center\nin NGC 5394. The position of NGC 5394 in the near\u2013infrared line\u2013ratio diagnostic diagrams indicates a starburst of duration a few Myr, observed several Myr after the peak\nstar\u2013formation episode. The starburst in NGC 5394 has nearly the same radio continuum\nluminosity and linear size as the central starburst in M82 (Paper I; Condon et al. (1990)).\nUnlike M82, NGC 5394 is viewed nearly face\u2013on. The H\u03b1 line profile at the nucleus of NGC\n5394 has a 100 km s\u22121 velocity asymmetry (an extended blue wing), which may represent a\nwind/outflow of ionized gas perpendicular to the disk (Paper I). In the M82 starburst, an\noutflow speed of several hundred km s\u22121 is seen in the molecular gas (Shen & Lo 1995) as\nwell as in the ionized gas. Our BIMA observations of NGC 5394, particularly the velocity\ndata, provide information about the structure of the starburst region in NGC 5394 and the\nrelative spatial distributions of 12 CO J = 1 \u2192 0 and H\u03b1 emission.\nFor the \"standard\" value of the Milky Way conversion factor X = N(H2 )/ICO , we adopt\n2.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 1020 H2 cm\u22122 (K km s\u22121 )\u22121 from Strong et al. (1988) since this value has been\nwidely used. More recent determinations for the Milky Way give somewhat lower values\nof 1.9 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 1020 (Strong & Mattox 1996), and 1.8 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 1020 (Dame, Hartmann, &\nThaddeus, 2001). We shall estimate the value of X for the starburst region of NGC 5394\nby comparing its radio continuum, H\u03b1, 60 \u03bcm, and CO luminosities. For luminous infrared\ngalaxies involved in mergers, measurements of the dynamical mass (Alonso\u2013Herrero et al.\n2001; Shier, Rieke, & Rieke 1994) and estimates of the molecular mass based on millimeter\u2013\nwave thermal emission of dust (Braine & Dumke 1998) indicate that the standard value of\nX overestimates the molecular mass by factors ranging from 3 to greater than 10 in these\npowerful starbursts. The starburst in NGC 5394 is more modest, comparable to that in M82.\nWild et al. (1992) and Smith et al. (1991) found that the value of X in the M82 starburst is\na factor of 3 below the standard value.\nThe northern half of NGC 5395 was included as well in our BIMA observations.\nCO J = 1 \u2192 0 emission from NGC 5395 was detected in the Onsala observations (Paper\nI) and in the NRAO 12\u2013m observations by Zhu et al. (1999). In other galaxies, nonthermal\nradio continuum emission and 12 CO J = 1 \u2192 0 emission are usually correlated on scales of\n\u223c 2 kpc (Adler, Allen, & Lo 1991). Since the eastern half of the ring/pseudo\u2013ring in NGC\n5395 is the brighter side in radio continuum emission but the fainter side in HI, we wanted\nto find out if the eastern half of the ring is the brighter side in CO emission. We expected\nto see a strong shock front in the molecular gas along the radio continuum ridge. We also\nlooked for any CO emission associated with an unusual \"shell\u2013like\" stellar structure on the\nnortheastern side (marked as \"caustic 1\" in Fig. 1), which was interpreted in Paper I as a\ncaustic produced by temporary convergence of orbits.\n\n12\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nIn addition to the BIMA CO data, our analysis uses HI, Fabry\u2013Perot H\u03b1, radio continuum, single\u2013dish CO, and broad\u2013band near-infrared and optical observations from Paper\nI and the VLA radio continuum image from the FIRST survey (Becker, White, & Helfand\n1995).\nWith the adopted distance of 47 Mpc for the galaxy pair, 1\u2032\u2032 corresponds to 230 pc. The\nvelocities in this paper are heliocentric and use the optical definition for the nonrelativistic\nDoppler shift.10\nSection 2 describes the observations and the data reduction. Section 3 describes the\noptical and near\u2013infrared morphology of NGC 5394. Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 present our CO\nresults on NGC 5394, with the general CO distribution in Section 4, the eastern inner\u2013disk\narm in Section 5, the central starburst in Section 6, and a comparison of CO, H\u03b1, and\nHI velocity fields in Section 7. Section 8 discusses the implications for development of a\nstarburst in a nonmerging encounter of this type. Section 9 discusses NGC 5395. Section 10\ncontains our conclusions.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n\nThe BIMA 12 CO J = 1 \u2192 0 observations were made on 1999 June 4 with 10 telescopes\nin C configuration. We used two pointings to cover NGC 5394 and the northern half of NGC\n5395. The duration of the run was 10.7 hours. Table 2 gives a summary of the observations.\nThe phase calibrator was the quasar 1310+323, the bandpass calibrator was 3C 273, and the\nabsolute flux standard was Mars. The observations have a velocity resolution of 4.06 km s\u22121\nand were centered on 3497 km s\u22121 with a total bandwidth of 908 km s\u22121 .\nThe data reduction was carried out using standard reduction algorithms from the\nMIRIAD package (Sault, Teuben, & Wright 1995). The data were Hanning smoothed to\n10 km s\u22121 channels. The two pointings were mosaiced to form a single cube with pixel size\n= 1.\u2032\u2032 5, synthesized beam = 6.\u2032\u2032 6 \u00d7 6.\u2032\u2032 3, and dimensions 198 \u00d7 211 \u00d7 60 pixels (R.A. \u00d7 DEC\n\u00d7 velocity), covering the velocity range 3208 to 3808 km s\u22121 . The dirty channel maps were\nthen deconvolved by using the Steer\u2013Dewdney\u2013Ito CLEAN algorithm (Steer, Dewdney, &\nIto 1984). The rms noise in the cleaned 10 km s\u22121 channel maps is 80 mJy beam\u22121 , only\nslightly higher than the theoretical noise of 76 mJy beam\u22121 . In Fig. 1, the 50% and 90%\n10\n\nWhere necessary, the relation vhelio,opt = vlsr,radio + 28 km s\u22121 was used to convert velocities to the\nheliocentric, optical system. Recall that the optical definition is vopt = c(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb0 )/\u03bb0 , where \u03bb0 is the rest\nwavelength.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nsensitivity contours of the combined primary beams after mosaicking the data are overlaid\non the r-band image in grayscale. Figure 2 displays channel maps from the BIMA CO cube\noverlaid on a gray\u2013scale display of the Digitized Sky Survey image11 for the range of velocities\nappropriate to NGC 5394. Moment maps of the total emission and of the intensity\u2013weighted\nvelocity field were made from this cube.\nAreas of genuine CO emission were selected by clipping at 2\u00d7 the rms noise in a cube\nconvolved to 12\u2032\u2032 resolution and requiring that a feature be continuous in velocity in at least\ntwo adjacent channels. In NGC 5394, the only 12 CO J = 1 \u2192 0 emission seen in the BIMA\nobservations is from the central and southwestern half of the Onsala position B marked in\nFig. 1, that is, only from the central part of the galaxy. The CO emission from NGC 5394 is\npresent over the velocity range 3388 to 3528 km s\u22121 , and the peak brightness temperature\nTb in the channel maps is 2.05 K (after correction for primary beam attentuation). BIMA\nfinds very little CO emission from NGC 5395; a small region inside the arc formed by the\nstellar caustic has a peak Tb of 0.87 K (= 4.8\u00d7 the rms noise) at v = 3308 km s\u22121 .\n\n3.\n\nOptical and Infrared Morphology of NGC 5394\n\nNGC 5394 has MB = \u221219.7. On the basis of the HI velocity field, the observed value\nof vmax sin i, and the I\u2013band luminosity, Paper I concluded that NGC 5394 is viewed nearly\nface\u2013on with its major axis of projection into the sky\u2013plane at a position angle of 0\u25e6 . The\nstellar disk of NGC 5394 is intrinsically oval as a result of the encounter. In the sky\u2013plane,\nthe position angle of the photometric major axis varies continuously from 60\u25e6 to \u20136\u25e6 , and\nthe ellipticity increases from 0.21 to 0.60 (Paper I) as the galactocentric distance increases\nfrom 13\u2032\u2032 (the start of the tidal arms) to 51\u2032\u2032 (the isophotal major radius R25 measured by de\nVaucouleurs et al. (1991)). Ignoring the small difference at R25 between the position angles\nof the photometric major axis and the projection line of nodes, the area of the face\u2013on disk\n2\nat the 25th magnitude isophote = \u03c0a0 b0 = \u03c0(b sec i/a)R25\n, where a, b are the semi\u2013major\nand semi\u2013minor axes in the sky\u2013plane and a0 , b0 are the face\u2013on values. For comparisons\nwith other galaxies, as in Section 8 below, we take the effective value of R25 as (R25 )eff =\n(b sec i/a)1/2 R25 . With inclination i = 15\u25e6 and b/a = 0.4, this gives (R25 )eff = 33\u2032\u2032 = 7.6 kpc.\nNGC 5394 has two long, open tidal arms (see Fig. 1) with high arm\u2013interarm contrast\n(Paper I). The very bright inner\u2013disk spiral arms are disjoint from the long outer tidal arms,\nas the latter depart from the side of the inner\u2013disk arms at a large angle. The top panel of\n11\n\nThe POSS Digitized Sky Survey was produced at the Space Telescope Science Institute under grant\nNAG W-2166.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nFigure 3 is a sketch of features visible in the inner disk and center of NGC 5394. The eastern\ninner\u2013disk arm spirals outwards for 210\u25e6 in a clockwise direction, starting at R = 4\u2032\u2032 at a\nposition angle of 200\u25e6 and ending at R = 13\u2032\u2032 . The western inner\u2013disk arm spirals outward\nfrom R = 4\u2032\u2032 at a position angle of 30\u25e6 and appears to bifurcate at a position angle of \u201350\u25e6\ninto what we call the two western inner\u2013disk arms. The outer of the two western inner\u2013disk\narms is symmetric to the eastern inner\u2013disk arm, whereas the innermost western arm seems\nto be a separate structure. There is no evidence of on\u2013going star formation in either the\neastern or the outer of the two western inner\u2013disk arms. H\u03b1 emission is detected from the\ninnermost western arm (Paper I).\nThere is a barlike structure (see Fig. 3, top panel) with a major axis of 16\u2032\u2032 (= 3.7 kpc)\nat a position angle of 120\u25e6 (Paper I; Bushouse & Stanford (1992)). We shall refer to this\nfeature as the primary bar; with an axis ratio of \u223c 1.7, it is a fat bar. The inner\u2013disk arms\nappear tangent to part of the primary bar but do not depart quite from the ends of the bar.\nIn the optical images, such as the Chengalur\u2013Nordgren r\u2013band image (Nordgren et al. 1997)\nin Fig. 1 which has 2.\u2032\u2032 3 resolution, one does not see straight dust lanes along the primary\nbar. Straight dust lanes are the signature of a bar that extends between an inner Lindblad\nresonance and corotation (Athanassoula 1992a,b). Measured widths of dust lanes in galaxies\nwith large bars are, typically, 100 \u2013 250 pc from (Benedict 1982) on NGC 7479 and our\nmeasurements on NGC 1300 and NGC 5236 (from images in Elmegreen et al. (1996) and\nSandage & Bedke (1988), respectively). At the distance of NGC 5394, this corresponds to\n0.\u2032\u2032 5 \u2013 1.\u2032\u2032 0, so, if present in NGC 5394, the optical resolution may not be good enough to see\nthem. Interior to the primary bar, the near\u2013infrared J and K\u2013band images by Bushouse &\nStanford (1992) reveal an elongated feature with a major axis of \u223c 7\u2032\u2032 and a position angle\nof 90\u25e6 , thus trailing the bar by 30\u25e6 in azimuth. This smaller oval feature is not evident in\nthe J\u2013band image (1\u2032\u2032 resolution) in Paper I or the 2-MASS J, H, K images (3.\u2032\u2032 3 resolution)\nor in the Chengalur\u2013Nordgren r\u2013band image. In Section 7 below, we consider the kinematic\nevidence for this possible secondary bar.\nFrom the twist of the HI velocity contours at the outer tidal arm, Paper I concluded that\nthe outer tidal arms are outside of corotation. If the outer arms are driving a density\u2013wave\nin the inner arms (it is not clear that this is occurring), then the radius where the inner\u2013disk\narms end and the outer tidal arms begin (1.6 times the semi\u2013major axis of the primary bar)\nmay represent either corotation or the outer Lindblad resonance for the inner\u2013disk spiral\narms.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n4.\n\nGeneral CO Distribution in NGC 5394\n\nThe Onsala observations (Paper I) measured a total integrated 12 CO J = 1 \u2192 0 flux\nSCO of 168 Jy km s\u22121 from a five\u2013position survey of NGC 5394 with a 33\u2032\u2032 (HPBW) beam\nat 33\u2032\u2032 spacing; of this, 129 Jy km s\u22121 is from the pointing (position B in Fig. 1) centered\non the starburst nucleus and the rest is from a weak detection (3\u00d7 rms noise) in a pointing\ncentered 33\u2032\u2032 south of the nucleus, which includes the southern tidal arm. With the NRAO\n12\u2013m telescope, Zhu et al. (1999) measured a CO integrated flux of 154 Jy km s\u22121 in a 55\u2032\u2032\n(HPBW) beam; this is consistent with the Onsala value. With the adopted standard value\nof the conversion factor X, the Onsala SCO corresponds to an M(H2 ) of 3.4 \u00d7109 M\u2299 . Paper\nI found M(HI) = 7.3 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 . After adding a 36% by mass contribution from helium to\nthe atomic plus molecular hydrogen mass, this gives a total mass in gas of 5.5 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 .\nHowever, as mentioned in the Introduction, use of the standard value of X in a starburst\nregion is questionable. We shall estimate X for the starburst region in Section 6 and discuss\nthe M(H2 )/M(HI) ratio for the galaxy in Section 8 below.\nIn the bottom panel of Figure 3, contours of the BIMA 12 CO J = 1 \u2192 0 integrated\u2013\nintensity ICO , after correction for primary\u2013beam attenuation, are overlaid on an unsharp\u2013\nmasked J\u2013band image (1\u2032\u2032 resolution, from Paper I) in gray\u2013scale to show the location of the\nCO emission relative to the eastern inner\u2013disk arm and the two western inner\u2013disk arms.\nThe bottom panel of Fig. 4 displays contours of H\u03b1 emission (2.\u2032\u2032 4 resolution, from Paper\nI) overlaid on the ICO image in gray\u2013scale. In the nucleus there is a marginal displacement\nbetween the surface brightness maximum in CO and the optical/radio continuum surface\nbrightness maximum (see Section 6 below). Aside from this, the 12 CO J = 1 \u2192 0 emission and H\u03b1 emission have a similar lopsided distribution of extended emission towards the\nsouthwest. In particular, no CO or H\u03b1 emission is detected from the eastern inner\u2013disk arm,\nwhich is bright in the optical continuum. Star formation in the disk appears to follow the\ndistribution of molecular gas.\nThe total integrated CO flux detected with BIMA is SCO = 117 Jy km s\u22121 , with an\nrms noise of \u00b18 Jy km s\u22121 and an uncertainty in the flux calibration of 10% - 15%. For the\naperture containing the starburst nucleus and the inner disk arms (position B), the single\u2013\ndish Onsala observations find SCO = 129 Jy km s\u22121 , with an rms noise of \u00b17 Jy km s\u22121 .\nThus, within the uncertainties (rms noise, calibration), the BIMA map detects all the CO\nemission seen by Onsala at position B, so the Onsala observations support the conclusion\nfrom the BIMA map that any CO emission at the eastern inner\u2013disk arm is below the rms\nnoise in either data set.\nIn the top panel of Fig. 4, ICO contours are overlaid on the radio continuum \u03bb = 20 cm\nimage from the FIRST survey (Becker, White, & Helfand 1995) in gray\u2013scale. The spatial\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nresolution of the BIMA image (6.\u2032\u2032 6\u00d76.\u2032\u2032 3, HPBW) is a little lower than that of the radio image\n(5.\u2032\u2032 4 HPBW). The radio continuum emission is strongly peaked on the starburst nucleus and\nsymmetrically distributed about it.\nThe HI observations of Paper I are more sensitive to low column density gas than the\nCO observations presented here. We detected HI emission from the entire inner disk, the\nsouthern tidal arm, and the inner third of the northern tidal arm (see Figure 5). The line\u2013\nof\u2013sight HI column density N(HI) is greater on the western side than on the eastern side of\nthe disk. The distributions of the ionized gas, atomic gas, and molecular gas in the disk of\nNGC 5394 all favor the western or southwestern side. Unless driven by external forces, such\na lopsided distribution of gas should not last more than a few shear times.\nRoughly 80% of the BIMA CO emission from NGC 5394 is concentrated in the central\n800 pc (FWHM) starburst region,12 and the rest comes from the part of the inner disk\nsouth and west of the central starburst. After subtracting the CO emission from the 800 pc\nstarburst (assumed axisymmetric), we get the residual ICO image displayed in the top panel\nof Figure 6. The innermost western arm, 6\u2032\u2032 west of the nucleus, appears as an arm in H\u03b1 with\nthe brightest H\u03b1 emission along its inside edge (see bottom panel of Figure 6). Part of this\narm is detected in CO emission, with a maximum ICO of 31 K km s\u22121 , equivalent to a line\u2013\nof\u2013sight column density N(H2 ) of 7 \u00d7 1021 H2 cm\u22122 . The P\u2013V diagrams in Figure 7 are for a\nslice along the declination axis, 6\u2032\u2032 west of the nucleus, and thus display the emission from the\ninnermost western arm. These diagrams show that CO and H\u03b1 have a similar distribution\nof velocities as well as similar mean velocities at this arm. Since the H\u03b1 resolution is 2.\u2032\u2032 4,\nthe H\u03b1 P\u2013V diagram in Fig. 7 contains negligible emission from the starburst, whereas the\nCO P\u2013V diagram contains some starburst emission.\nBefore correction for the velocity gradient across the beam, the CO one\u2013dimensional\nvelocity dispersion at the innermost western arm is 15 km s\u22121 . To correct for the velocity\ngradient, we subtract the velocity difference across the Gaussian beam in quadrature. We\nhave confirmed with numerical experiments that subtracting in quadrature is the appropriate\ncorrection (for plausible values of linear shear). This reduces the CO velocity dispersion to\n14 km s\u22121 . Since estimates of the cloud\u2013cloud CO velocity dispersion in the Milky Way\nrange from 3 to 9 km s\u22121 , with a median value of 4 km s\u22121 (Combes 1991), the CO velocity\ndispersion at the innermost western arm seems to be somewhat higher than normal for\ngalaxy disks. If attributed to unresolved in\u2013disk streaming motions, such motions would\nneed to be large because the disk is viewed nearly face\u2013on (inclination i = 15\u25e6 ). Over much\n12\n\nThe 800 pc size is from a Gaussian fit to the \u03bb = 20 cm radio continuum and H\u03b1 emission, deconvolved\nfrom the point spread function.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nof the disk of NGC 5394, Paper I found HI velocity dispersions of 20 \u2013 40 km s\u22121 , which are\nhigh compared to the HI velocity dispersions of 6 \u2013 13 km s\u22121 in undisturbed spirals (see\nreferences in Kaufman et al. (1997)). Given the nearly face-on orientation of NGC 5394,\nthese velocity dispersions probably represent mainly the z\u2013component of the motions.\nPaper I reported a weak (3\u00d7 rms noise) detection in the Onsala observations of CO\nemission from the southern tidal arm of NGC 5394, with ICO = 3.3 K km s\u22121 . The BIMA\nobservations detect no emission here. As the 2\u00d7 rms noise upper limit to ICO in the BIMA\ndata, we take ICO = 2\u00d7 (the rms noise per channel in the BIMA cube) \u00d7 (the width of two\nchannels)/PB, where PB is the primary\u2013beam sensitivity of the mosaiced data. If the CO\nemission uniformly fills the Onsala 33\u2032\u2032 aperture on the southern tidal arm, it would be too\nfaint to detect in the BIMA observations since the 2\u00d7 rms noise upper limit to ICO at this\nposition is 7.1 K km s\u22121 in the BIMA map.\n\n5.\n\nThe Eastern Inner\u2013Disk Arm of NGC 5394\n\nThe eastern and the outer of the two western inner\u2013disk arms are both devoid of on\u2013\ngoing star formation. No CO emission is detected from the eastern inner\u2013disk arm. This\nis probably also the case for the outer of the two western inner\u2013disk arms, but at our CO\nresolution, the situation there is contaminated by CO emission from the innermost western\narm. Therefore we concentrate on the eastern inner\u2013disk arm but assume that the same\nlogic applies to the outer of the two western inner\u2013disk arms.\nWhy is there no evidence of star formation in progress at the eastern inner\u2013disk arm?\nWe consider first the surface density of gas. HI emission from this arm is present with a\nline\u2013of\u2013sight column density N(HI) = 7 \u00d7 1020 atoms cm\u22122 (measured with resolution = 11\u2032\u2032\n= 2.6 kpc HPBW in Paper I). The 2\u00d7 rms noise upper limit to ICO at the eastern inner\u2013disk\narm in the BIMA data is 7.6 K km s\u22121 . With the \"standard\" value of X, this corresponds\nto a 2\u00d7 rms noise upper limit to N(H2 ) of 1.7 \u00d7 1021 H2 cm\u22122 .\nFrom observations of spiral galaxies, Kennicutt (1989) and Martin & Kennicutt (2001)\nfound that the instability parameter Qgas \u2264 1.4 for significant star formation to occur. The\ninstability parameter Qgas = \u03ba\u03c3v,gas /\u03c0G\u03bcgas , where \u03ba is the epicyclic frequency, \u03c3v,gas is the\none\u2013dimensional velocity dispersion in the gas, and \u03bcgas is the face-on surface density of\ngas. Paper I used HI data to determine values for these parameters. A position\u2013velocity\ndiagram in HI from Paper I (with 18\u2032\u2032 resolution) and a position\u2013velocity diagram in CO (with\n6.\u2032\u2032 6 \u00d7 6.\u2032\u2032 3 resolution), are displayed in Figure 8 and in the left panel of Figure 9, respectively,\nfor a cut through the optical nucleus with abscissa along the projection line\u2013of\u2013nodes of the\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ngalaxy (position angle = 0\u25e6 ). The HI P\u2013V diagram provides a rather messy \"rotation curve\"\nbecause NGC 5394 is viewed nearly face\u2013on, the HI velocity dispersion is high, there are\nstreaming motions associated with the tidal arms and the bar, and the spatial resolution is\nlow. From the HI data, Paper I concluded that the inner\u2013disk arms are located on the solid\nbody part of the rotation curve and took the epicyclic frequency at galactocentric distance\nR = 10\u2032\u2032 (on the eastern inner\u2013disk arm) as \u03ba = 2\u03a9 = 37 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 , where \u03a9 is the\norbital angular speed.13 Also, the inclination i was estimated to be 9\u25e6 by comparing the\nobserved value of vmax sin i = 27 km s\u22121 with the expected value of vmax = 163 \u00b1 26 km s\u22121\nfrom the I\u2013band luminosity (see Paper I).\nWith the higher angular resolution of the CO P\u2013V diagram, we see that the rotation\ncurve has a steeper rise in the inner disk than apparent from the HI data. It may have turned\nover by R = 10\u2032\u2032 in the south (see Figure 9), but it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion\nbecause the emission at this radius is faint, the velocities are affected by the streaming along\nthe bar, and the CO resolution is \u223c 6.5\u2032\u2032 . At R = 10\u2032\u2032 we find \u03a9 = 41 km s\u22121 /(2.3 kpc sin i).\nThe added information from the CO P\u2013V diagram changes vmax sin i to 41 km s\u22121 , and thus\nchanges our estimate of the inclination i to 15\u25e6 and our estimate of the epicyclic frequency \u03ba\nto [2 (41 km s\u22121 )]/(2.3 kpc sin i) = 1.4 \u00d7 102 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 at 10\u2032\u2032 if in solid body rotation,\n\u221a\nor a factor of 2 less if on the flat part of the rotation curve.\nSince the distribution of gas is lopsided, we use the surface density of gas on the eastern\ninner\u2013disk arm at R = 10\u2032\u2032 to compute the instability parameter. For \u03c3v,gas , we adopt from\nPaper I the HI value of 30 km s\u22121 at the eastern inner\u2013disk arm. The HI column density\nat this arm is N(HI) = 7 \u00d7 1020 atoms cm\u22122 . Including a 36% by mass contribution from\nhelium,\n\u03bcgas = (1 + 0.36)[N(HI) + 2N(H2 )]mp cos i,\n(1)\nwhere mp is the proton mass. (The calculation of \u03bcgas in Paper I ignored the contributions\nfrom helium and molecular gas.) Using the above 2\u00d7 rms noise upper limit to N(H2 ) gives\nan upper limit to \u03bcgas of 43 M\u2299 pc\u22122 at R = 10\u2032\u2032 on the eastern inner\u2013disk arm and a lower\nlimit to Qgas of 5.0 if on the flat part of rotation curve. An upper limit to Qgas is obtained\nby setting N(H2 ) = 0: Qgas = 29 if on the flat part of the rotation curve. The values of Qgas\n\u221a\nshould be increased by 2 if in solid\u2013body rotation. Thus Qgas lies in the range 5 to 42.\nSince this exceeds critical value of 1.4 from Kennicutt (1989) (see also Martin & Kennicutt\n(2001)), it appears that the instability parameter Qgas is presently too high for significant\nstar formation at the eastern inner\u2013disk arm.\nFor comparison, star formation is presently occurring on the innermost western arm\n13\n\nThe value was misprinted in Paper I as 3.7 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 .\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nand CO emission is detected from a portion of that arm. To compute Qgas there, we take\nour peak value of ICO at this arm, which corresponds to an N(H2 ) of 6.9 \u00d7 1021 H2 cm\u22122\nand use our measured CO velocity dispersion of 14 km s\u22121 for \u03c3v,gas since N(H2 ) dominates\nN(HI) here. Then with solid body rotation, we get Qgas \u223c 1. So the Toomre gravitational\ninstability criterion seems to explain the presence of star formation on the innermost western\narm, provided the value of the conversion factor X is not appreciably less than the standard\nvalue.\nThe simple answer to the question of why there is no evidence of ongoing star formation\nat the eastern inner\u2013disk arm or at the outer of the two western inner\u2013disk arms is that\nthere is presently too little molecular gas there. The question becomes why is there so little\nmolecular gas associated with optically bright spiral arms.\n\n6.\n6.1.\n\nCentral Starburst in NGC 5394\n\nCO Flux, Star Formation Rate, and Extinction\n\nThe total SCO in NGC 5394 detected by BIMA is 117 Jy km s\u22121 . Of this, approximately\n97 Jy km s\u22121 is from the starburst region (on the assumption of east\u2013west symmetry for the\nstarburst). Using the adopted standard value of X, we make the following comparison\nbetween the NGC 5394 starburst and the M82 starburst. The NGC 5394 starburst has a\nradio continuum luminosity at \u03bb = 20 cm of 7.7 \u00d7 1021 W Hz\u22121 (Paper I), a linear size of 800\npc, and an H2 mass M(H2 ) of 1.9 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 (excluding helium). The M82 starburst has a\nradio continuum luminosity of 1.0 \u00d7 1022 W Hz\u22121 , a size of 600 pc (Condon et al. 1990), and\nan M(H2 ) measured by Wild et al. (1992) for a region with diameter 800 pc and scaled to\nthe same value of X of 4.9 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 . Thus, compared to the M82 starburst, the starburst\nin NGC 5394 has about the same linear size, 77% of the \u03bb20 cm radio continuum luminosity,\nbut \u223c 4 times the CO luminosity. It may be that the M82 starburst is in a more advanced\nstate and has already used up more of the gas. Rieke et al. (1993) suggested that the M82\nstarburst consists of two starbursts, one of which started 3 \u00d7 107 years ago and the other,\n5 \u00d7 106 years ago. Vanzi, Alonso\u2013Herrero, & Rieke (1998) found that the starburst in NGC\n5394 is several Myr past the peak star\u2013formation rate.\nFor the position of the nucleus, we take the location of the bright radio continuum peak\nin the FIRST image. (The stated uncertainty of the FIRST survey position is 0.\u2032\u2032 4). There is\nnegligible displacement between the surface brightness maxima in the radio continuum, J\u2013\nband, and H\u03b1. The ICO maximum is 0.\u2032\u2032 8 west and 0.\u2032\u2032 4 south of the radio continuum position.\nSince the positional uncertainty of the CO maximum is less than 0.\u2032\u2032 6, the offset between the\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nICO and radio continuum maxima is marginal. It could result from some depletion of the\nCO flux at the radio continuum maximum, e. g., by photodissociation of CO or by star\nformation consuming the gas. Gaussian fits to the emission (Table 3) show that the H\u03b1\nsource and the radio continuum source in the center of NGC 5394 have the same size, 800 pc\n(FWHM). The CO emission with a major axis of 1.1 kpc (FWHM) is slightly more extended.\nThe radio continuum emission from NGC 5394 is nonthermal with a spectral index of \u22120.7,\nand 83% of the radio continuum flux density S\u03bd (20) of NGC 5394 at \u03bb = 20 cm is from the\nstarburst region (see Table 1).\nThere is no evidence that the emission from the center of NGC 5394 is dominated by\nan AGN. The optical and near\u2013infrared spectra (Leech et al. 1989; Vanzi, Alonso\u2013Herrero,\n& Rieke 1998) are HII region\u2013type. The radio continuum emission does not appear to be\nsufficiently compact to be mainly from an AGN. It is likely that most of the radio emission\noriginates from SNRs or cosmic\u2013ray electrons previously accelerated in supernovae, as is the\ncase for the M82 starburst.\nThe measured H\u03b1 flux from the NGC 5394 starburst, not corrected for extinction,\nimplies a radio continuum flux density from optically thin free\u2013free emission 0.9% of the\nmeasured value of S\u03bd (20) (see Paper I). We can get a firm upper limit to the average visual\nextinction Av of the HII regions by assuming that all the measured S\u03bd (20) is free\u2013free emission\n(clearly it is not, since the spectral index is nonthermal). The resulting upper limit, Av =\n1.28 \u00d7 A(H\u03b1) = 6.5 mag, is unrealistically high since it assumes a thermal fraction at \u03bb 20\ncm of 100%. For a better estimate we choose the following two alternatives. In the M82\nstarburst, the thermal fraction at \u03bb 20 cm is 7%, as determined by Golla, Allen, & Kronberg\n(1996) from a comparison of [Ne II] 12.8 \u03bcm and radio continuum emission. If the same\nthermal fraction applies to the NGC 5394 starburst, then the intrinsic H\u03b1 flux is a factor of\n7.5 greater than the measured H\u03b1 flux, and the average extinction for star\u2013forming regions\nin the NGC 5394 central starburst is Av = 1.28(2.5) log 7.5 = 2.8 mag. If, instead, we adopt\nthe \u03bb20 cm thermal fraction of \u223c 13% typical of normal disk galaxies (Condon 1992), then\nthe intrinsic H\u03b1 flux is a factor of 14 times the measured H\u03b1 flux, and the average extinction\nfor the HII regions is Av = 3.7 mag.\nAttributing all of the IRAS 60 \u03bcm flux of the Arp 84 system to NGC 5394, Leech et\nal. (1989) derived a luminosity ratio L(60\u03bcm)/L(H\u03b1) of 2000 for the NGC 5394 starburst.\nFor the disks of bright spiral galaxies, Leech et al. (1989) found L(60\u03bcm)/L(H\u03b1) equals 20\n\u2013 200 (based on data from Persson & Helou (1987) in which the H\u03b1 flux of the disk was\ncorrected for a mean extinction of 1.1 mag at H\u03b1). With a resolution of 4.8\u2032 \u00d7 1.5\u2032 at 60 \u03bcm,\nthe IRAS 60 \u03bcm flux of Arp 84 includes both galaxies. To determine what fraction of the\nIRAS flux is from the NGC 5394 starburst, we use the FIR\u2013nonthermal radio correlation\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nfor spiral galaxies. Since Paper I finds that 29% of the radio continuum flux from the galaxy\npair is from the central starburst in NGC 5394, we attribute 29% of the IRAS 60 \u03bcm flux\nto the NGC 5394 starburst. This reduces the value of L(60\u03bcm)/L(H\u03b1) for the starburst to\n\u223c 600. If we adopt the range of values (2.8 \u2013 3.7 mag) for the average Av from the thermal\nfraction argument, then the value of L(60\u03bcm)/L(H\u03b1) is further reduced to the range 40 \u2013\n80, similar to values found in the disks of bright spirals. Adoption of an average Av of 3 \u2013 4\nmag gives a plausible consistency between the IRAS 60 \u03bcm flux, the radio continuum, and\nthe H\u03b1 flux. It thus appears that the intrinsic H\u03b1 flux is an order of magnitude greater than\nthe observed H\u03b1 flux. In that case, the dereddened H\u03b1 luminosity of the starburst region is\n\u223c 8 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 . Then, taking the star formation rate SFR = 7.9 \u00d7 10\u221242 L(H\u03b1) M\u2299 yr\u22121\nfrom Kennicutt (1998), we get an SFR of 6 \u00b1 2 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for the starburst region.\nThe H\u03b2 to H\u03b1 emission\u2013line ratio (Balmer decrement) measured for the NGC 5394\nnucleus by Leech et al. (1989) with a 1.\u2032\u2032 5 wide slit gives a visual extinction Av of 1.3 mag\n(assuming Case B recombination). They find broad\u2013band optical colors, uncorrected for\nreddening, similar to those of G stars. They note that the H\u03b1 flux is roughly consistent\nwith the number of ionizing stars implied by the broad\u2013band optical fluxes. In the BIMA\ndata, the maximum ICO in the nucleus is 1.7 \u00d7 102 K km s\u22121 , and the mean value of ICO\nfor the starburst is 66 K km s\u22121 . With the standard value of the conversion factor X, the\nmaximum ICO implies a column density N(H2 ) = 3.8 \u00d7 1022 H2 cm\u22122 , and the mean ICO , a\ncolumn density N(H2 ) = 1.5 \u00d7 1022 H2 cm\u22122 . For a standard dust\u2013to\u2013gas ratio with Av /Ngas\n= 0.53 \u00d7 10\u221221 mag ( atoms cm\u22122 )\u22121 (Bohlin, Savage, & Drake 1978), the mean CO column\ndensity implies a highly opaque region with Av = 11 mag to the midplane. Although it\nis known that the dust\u2013to\u2013gas ratio is proportional to metallicity Z (Sodroski et al. 1995),\nwe lack a reliable determination of the metallicity of the NGC 5394 starburst. Leech et al.\n(1989) note that the measured value of the [N II]/H\u03b1 emission\u2013line ratio for the starburst\nis compatible with solar metallicity but warn this is not conclusive because the ionization\nparameter is unknown.\nHow can we reconcile these three very different values for Av ? The small value of Av\n(1.3 mag) from the Balmer decrement as compared to the average extinction (3 \u2013 4 mag)\nfrom the thermal fraction argument means that the observed optical flux originates from\nregions of small optical depth (near the edges of the clouds), and we are not seeing the\noptical photons emitted by stars and HII regions deeply embedded in opaque clouds. Thus,\noptically, most of the starburst is hidden from view, probably in a patchy distribution of\nhighly opaque clouds, as Leech et al. (1989) suggest.\nThe value of Av (11 mag) deduced from the mean ICO with standard values for X\nand the dust\u2013to\u2013gas ratio exceeds the average Av of 3 \u2013 4 mag from the radio thermal\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nfraction versus H\u03b1 and L(60\u03bcm)/L(H\u03b1) arguments. The most likely explanation is that\nthe conversion factor X = N(H2 )/ICO in the starburst region is a factor of 3 \u2013 4 below the\nstandard value. Similar reductions in the value of X have been obtained for high excitation\nregions in the centers of other galaxies (Wall et al. 1993; Regan 2000). For the Milky Way,\nSodroski et al. (1995) concluded that X is a factor of 3 \u2013 10 lower near the Galactic center\nthan in the disk at R = 2 \u2013 7 kpc. In the M82 starburst, Smith et al. (1991) and Wild et al.\n(1992) found that the value of X is a factor of 3 below the standard value. It appears that\nthe different physical conditions in a starburst nucleus (Brouillet & Schilke 1993; Aalto et al.\n1995, 1997) result in a smaller value of X than in the main disk of a spiral galaxy. Kaufman\net al. (1999b) calculate the dependence of X for a photodissociation region on far\u2013ultraviolet\nflux, density, column density, and metallicity and apply their model to the M82 starburst\nas an example. They can fit the M82 observations with clouds that have higher gas density\nand higher thermal pressures than GMCs in the Milky Way.\nUse of the standard value of X overestimates the extinction in the starburst region of\nNGC 5394 and, consequently, overestimates the total molecular mass of NGC 5394. If the\nvalue of X is down by a factor of 3 \u2013 4 in the starburst region but not reduced outside of\nthe starburst, then the total mass in gas in the galaxy is (3.6 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 109 M\u2299 .\n6.2.\n\nVelocity Structure\n\nFigure 9 displays position\u2013velocity diagrams through the nucleus of NGC 5394 in CO\nand in H\u03b1 (from the Fabry\u2013Perot data of Paper I) with the abscissa along the projection\nline\u2013of\u2013nodes of the galaxy (position angle = 0\u25e6 ). In the Fabry\u2013Perot H\u03b1 data, the mean\nvelocity at the nucleus is 7 km s\u22121 greater than the long\u2013slit value of 3451 \u00b1 12 km s\u22121\nobtained by Karachentsev (1980); this indicates the uncertainty in the calibration of the\nFabry\u2013Perot H\u03b1 velocities at the NGC 5394 nucleus. The channel width is 12 km s\u22121 in\nthe H\u03b1 cube and 10 km s\u22121 in the CO cube. These P\u2013V diagrams reveal two significant\ndifferences between the CO and H\u03b1 velocity distributions in the starburst region: (a) the CO\nemission is double\u2013peaked in velocity whereas the H\u03b1 emission has a single velocity peak and\n(b) in H\u03b1 a clear extension to lower velocities is seen at the nucleus but is absent in CO. The\nCO emission has one maximum at 3478 km s\u22121 and the other at 3438 km s\u22121 ; the average of\nthese two velocity peaks, 3458 km s\u22121 , is close to the H\u03b1 systemic velocity. The separation\nin velocity implies a spatial separation, e. g., one velocity peak from the approaching side\nand the other from the receding side. This could result from some depletion of CO at the\nnucleus by photodissociation or consumption by star formation or the molecular gas could be\nin a nuclear ring or in \"twin peaks\" near an inner Lindblad resonance (ILR). It also means\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nthat the two CO peaks are not spatially coincident with the peak in the H\u03b1 emission. If the\ndouble peaks in CO are in the disk plane of NGC 5394, then each has a velocity difference\nwith respect to the nucleus of (vobs \u2212 vsys )/ sin i = 20 km s\u22121 /sin 15\u25e6 = 77 km s\u22121 .\nWe made CO position\u2013velocity diagrams along various position angles. The maximum\nseparation between the two CO peaks is \u223c 2\u2032\u2032 (less than 1/3 the synthesized beamwidth),\nwith a smaller spatial separation along the bar major axis than along the bar minor axis. It\nis only the velocity structure that enables us to identify these as separate features.\nFigure 10 compares the CO line profile at the nucleus with the H\u03b1 line profile from Paper\nI. From a Gaussian fit to the CO line profile at the nucleus, we find that the CO central\nvelocity is 3453 km s\u22121 at the ICO maximum and that the FWHM is 88 \u00b1 2 km s\u22121 . Paper\nI suggested that the extended blue wing of the nuclear H\u03b1 profile (a velocity asymmetry of\n\u223c 100 km s\u22121 ) could represent an outflow of ionized gas from the starburst, perpendicular\nto the disk. From the above extinction estimate, a counterflow on the far side would not\nbe visible in H\u03b1. On the assumption that the H\u03b1 nuclear profile consists of a symmetric\nGaussian component from the starburst in the nuclear disk plus an outflow/wind (visible on\nthe near side only), we fit the high velocity side of the profile with one side of a Gaussian with\nFWHM = 77 km s\u22121 and then subtracted the (full) Gaussian profile to obtain the residual\nH\u03b1 spectrum shown in Fig. 10 for the outflow. In the H\u03b1 profile, the maximum residual\nintensity in the blue wing (which we associate to an outflow) is 22% of the maximum in the\noriginal line profile. There is a hint of a feature (2 \u2212 2.5\u00d7 the rms noise) in the CO profile\nat 80 \u2013 100 km s\u22121 to the red of vsys , but no clear evidence for a molecular counterpart to\nthe H\u03b1 outflow component.\nFor comparison, in M82 the optical emission lines give an outflow speed of \u223c 600\nkm s (Shopbell & Bland\u2013Hawthorn 1998), whereas the 12 CO J = 1 \u2192 0 and higher level\nCO molecular lines give an outflow speed of only \u223c 200 km s\u22121 (Shen & Lo 1995; Nakai et\nal. 1987; Seaquist & Clark 2001). Also, in M82, the line splitting that occurs in H\u03b1 is not\nseen in CO. If in the NGC 5394 starburst, the ratio of H\u03b1 to molecular outflow speeds is\nsimilar to that in M82, then in NGC 5394 it would be hard to identify an outflow in CO\n(that is, to distinguish between an outflow and a thick disk or spheroidal distribution) since\nthe H\u03b1 outflow speed is only \u223c 100/ cos 15\u25e6 km s\u22121 .\n\u22121\n\nThe CO data have lower spatial resolution than the H\u03b1 data. If we correct for the\ngradient of the mean velocity field across the respective beams (by subtracting the velocity\ndifference across the beam in quadrature), then the CO profile at the nucleus has a one\u2013\ndimensional velocity dispersion of 31 km s\u22121 and the part of the H\u03b1 line profile that we\nattribute to the nuclear disk has a one\u2013dimensional velocity dispersion of 30 km s\u22121 . This\nprobably represents mainly the z\u2013component of the velocity dispersion. The molecular and\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nH\u03b1 velocity dispersions at the NGC 5394 nucleus are about the same size as the z\u2013component\nof the molecular velocity dispersion (30 \u2013 54 km s\u22121 ) in the Milky Way Galactic Center\nestimated by Bally et al. (1988). The smaller value for the molecular velocity dispersion\nfound in Section 4 pertains to the innermost western arm, not the nucleus.\n\n7.\n\nComparison of CO, H\u03b1, and HI Velocity Fields of NGC 5394\n\nFigure 11 displays the 12 CO J = 1 \u2192 0 velocity field from the BIMA data, and Figure 12, the H\u03b1 velocity field (from Paper I). The CO velocity field covers only \u223c 2.5\u00d7 the\nBIMA synthesized half\u2013power beamwidth and does not reveal as much detail as the H\u03b1\nvelocity field. Given the difference in spatial resolution, the CO velocity field appears quite\nsimilar to the H\u03b1 velocity field. The similarity, despite H\u03b1 extinction, can be understood if\nthe H\u03b1 and CO emitting layers in the disk have negligible shear perpendicular to the disk.\nThe more extended VLA HI data in Paper I (18\u2032\u2032 resolution) provide the velocity field of the\nmain disk and the tidal arms. In the main disk, the HI velocity field has kinematic minor\naxis at 90\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 , so Paper I took the position angle of the galaxy's projection line of nodes\nas 0\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 . The near side of the galaxy is the western side. In the CO and H\u03b1 velocity fields,\nthe kinematic minor axis has rotated such that in the central 10\u2032\u2032 it has a very different\nposition angle of 125\u25e6 \u00b1 5\u25e6 and is along the major axis of the 16\u2032\u2032 \u2013long primary bar. Some\npossible explanations for the rotation of a kinematic minor axis in the inner disk of a galaxy\nare streaming along a bar or axisymmetric radial motions. The sense of rotation of the kinematic minor axis of NGC 5394 is opposite to that expected for axisymmetric radial inflow\nin the disk. Axisymmetric radial expansion in the disk would rotate the kinematic minor\naxis in the sky\u2013plane by tan \u2206\u03c6minor = \u2212(vexp /vt ) sec i, where \u2206\u03c6minor equals the position\nangle of the minor axis of the projection minus the position angle of the kinematic minor\naxis of the central region, vexp is the expansion speed (positive for expansion), and vt is the\ntangential speed (Wong & Blitz 2000). Since the observed \u2206\u03c6minor = 90\u25e6 \u2212 125\u25e6 = \u221235\u25e6 is\nnegative, there is no evidence that axisymmetric inflow of gas into the inner disk is presently\noccurring. If axisymmetric expansion, the implied value of vexp is large, 0.68 vt . The more\nlikely interpretation of the rotation of the kinematic minor axis is that it represents gas\nmoving in elliptical orbits around the bar. The inner\u2013disk arms may have a different pattern\nspeed than the primary bar, as they do not depart from the ends of the bar.\nSince NGC 5394 is viewed nearly face\u2013on, large in\u2013plane velocity excursions would not\nappear very prominent in any line\u2013of\u2013sight velocity field. With its higher spatial resolution,\nthe H\u03b1 velocity contours have more wiggles, indicative of streaming motions, than the CO\nvelocity contours. Some of these appear associated with the innermost western arm. Ad-\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nditionally, it seems likely that the u\u2013shaped kinks in the H\u03b1 velocity contours 3\u2032\u2032 southeast\nof the nucleus and the n\u2013shaped velocity kinks 3\u2032\u2032 northwest of the nucleus are related to\nthe possible secondary bar visible in the J and K\u2013band images in Bushouse & Stanford\n(1992). The bilateral symmetry of the velocity kinks at 3\u2032\u2032 provides kinematic evidence that\nthis stellar feature is a coherent structure produced by a non\u2013axisymmetric gravitational\npotential. The position angle of the kinematic minor axis changes from 125\u25e6 \u00b1 5\u25e6 at R \u223c 5\u2032\u2032\nto 102\u25e6 \u00b1 5\u25e6 at R \u223c 2\u2032\u2032 ; the kinks represent the transition between these two orientations.\nThus the velocity field supports the interpretation that there are two nested bars, with the\nsecondary bar trailing the primary bar by 30\u25e6 . It is puzzling that the secondary bar is not\nseen in the higher resolution J\u2013band image of Paper I.\n\n8.\n\nDiscussion of Results on NGC 5394\n\nThe BIMA 12 CO J = 1 \u2192 0 observations of the tidally\u2013distorted galaxy NGC 5394\nreveal that: (1) about 80% of the CO emission detected by BIMA is concentrated in the 800\npc (FWHM) starburst region; (2) the extended CO and H\u03b1 emission in the inner disk have\na similar lopsided spatial distribution, with an excess on the southwestern side of the disk,\nso star formation in the disk appears to be following the gas distribution; (3) no CO or H\u03b1\nemission are detected from the bright, eastern inner\u2013disk arm; (4) the estimated value of X\nin the starburst is a factor of 3 \u2013 4 below the standard value. The HI emission is also most\nprominent on the same (western) side of the disk as the CO and H\u03b1 emission, so in total\ngas NGC 5394 has a lopsided spatial distribution in the disk.\nReducing the value of the conversion factor X by a factor of 3 \u2013 4 in the starburst region\nbut using the standard value of X outside of the starburst, we find from the Onsala SCO\nthat M(H2 )/M(HI) = 2.5 \u2013 2.7, and that 20% \u2013 25% of the atomic plus molecular gas in the\ngalaxy is located in the central starburst. Galaxies with this high a value for M(H2 )/M(HI)\nare uncommon in the large sample of spiral galaxies surveyed by Casoli et al. (1998). Using\nthe standard value for X, they find the mean value of M(H2 )/M(HI) is 0.28 for Sa to Sc\ngalaxies. Like other starburst galaxies, NGC 5394 is CO\u2013rich. Also, using the standard\n2\nvalue of X, Casoli et al. (1998) find that the average values of [M(H2 ) + M(HI)]/D25\nrange\n6\n\u22122\n7\n\u22122\nfrom 5.6 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 kpc for Sa galaxies to 1.0 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 kpc for Sd galaxies, where D25\n2\nis the isophotal diameter. They emphasize that [M(H2 ) + M(HI)]/D25\nis simply a means\nof normalizing the gas mass to a measure of the galaxy size and should not be interpreted\nas a gas surface density. Since NGC 5394 is intrinsically oval, we set the value of D25 for\nNGC 5394 equal to 2(R25 )eff , where (R25 )eff is defined in Section 3. Reducing the value of\nX by a factor of 3 \u2013 4 in the starburst region but using the standard value of X outside of\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n2\nthe starburst gives [M(H2 ) + M(HI)]/D25\n= (1.2 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 107 M\u2299 kpc\u22122 , which is typical\nof late\u2013type spirals. The present lack of star formation in two of the three inner\u2013disk arms\nresults not from an overall paucity of gas in NGC 5394 but from its spatial distribution.\n\nPaper I presented a galaxy encounter simulation that reproduces some of the main\nfeatures of this galaxy pair with a collision that is prograde relative to NGC 5394 and\nretrograde at a high tilt angle relative to NGC 5395. In the model, the response of NGC\n5394 to the cos 2\u03b8 tidal potential of the encounter produces an eye\u2013shaped (\"ocular\") oval,\nwhich subsequently evolves into inner\u2013disk arms, like those visible in NGC 5394. There\nis a west versus east time lag in the development of the ocular oval, with the eye\u2013shaped\nrim forming first on what is now the eastern side of NGC 5394. The model keeps count of\nthe number of gas particles in spherical volumes of radii 1.6 kpc and 4 kpc in the center\nof NGC 5394 as the encounter progresses. This is displayed in Figure 13. The limited\nparticle resolution of the model prevents us from treating smaller volumes. The number\nof gas particles within 1.6 kpc of the center builds up fairly steadily so that by the time\nof closest approach the mean gas density of this region is three times its initial value and\nby the present time it has leveled off at four times its initial value. The model finds that\nthe amount of material in the central regions is no longer increasing at the present time;\nrecall that the observed velocity field shows no evidence of present axisymmetric inflow (see\nSection 7).\nThe dominant tidal perturbation to NGC 5394 is an m = 2 mode. This drives angular momentum transport, which produces the long tidal tails and inflow into the central\nregion. The encounter also involves an m = 1 term, which accounts for the time lag in the\ndevelopment of the eastern and western sides of the ocular oval. The model for this system\n(described in Paper I) uses rigid halos (softened point\u2013mass potentials). As the galaxies\npass each other in the model, their disks do not quite interpenetrate but their halos do.\nThis results in a transient m = 0 compression in the perturbation: before closest approach,\nNGC 5394 compresses as a result of the increasing tidal force of the NGC 5395 halo. This\ncontributes to the infall into the central region before closest approach, while after closest\napproach the inflow into the central region results from ocular\u2013induced angular momentum\ntransport and inertia.\nThe observed lopsided distribution of gas could result from an asymmetry in the collisional perturbation plus the loss of angular momentum by the gas in shocks. The latter\nis necessary to differentiate between the gas and the stars because the distribution of old\nstars does not show the same lopsidedness as the gas. In the model, the asymmetry of the\nperturbation is evident as a time lag in the development of the two sides of the ocular oval.\nSince the stars form a collisionless system, they may respond differently than the gas, which\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\ncan lose angular momentum in shocks. We offer the following speculative scenario for the\ninner\u2013disk arms. The west versus east time lag in the development of the ocular oval may\nhave led to a west versus east time lag in the formation of the inner\u2013disk arms and to a west\nversus east time lag in the inflow of gas to the center. Gas at the eastern and the outer of\nthe two western inner\u2013disk arms underwent shocks (e.g., as a result of the bar, which may\ndiffer in pattern speed from the inner\u2013disk arms) and flowed towards the center, leaving the\nstellar arms behind. This needs to be confirmed with more detailed simulations. Another\npossibility is that there may have been more gas inflowing towards the center on the western\nside.\nNot all interacting galaxies are CO\u2013rich (Horellou & Booth 1997). From a comparison\nof the observed morphologies with models for prograde, in\u2013plane, grazing encounters, Paper\nI concluded that the galaxies IC 2163, NGC 2535, and NGC 5394 form three distinct stages\nin the development of structures in this type of collision, with IC 2163 the least evolved and\nNGC 5394 the most evolved interaction. The \"age\" sequence is also seen in the star formation\nrates. IC 2163 has star formation typical of normal spiral disks (Elmegreen et al. 2001), and\nwidespread CO emission is found in SEST observations with 44\u2032\u2032 resolution (Thomasson\net al., in progress). In NGC 2535, star formation is somewhat enhanced (Bernl\u00f6hr 1993),\nthe brightest H\u03b1 emission (Amram et al. 1989) occurs at the eastern and western ends of\nthe eye\u2013shaped oval at R \u2248 5 kpc from the nucleus, and the Onsala observations with\n33\u2032\u2032 resolution had clear detections of CO emission only from the central pointing (which\nincludes the western apex) and from the portion of the tidal tail just beyond the eastern\napex (Kaufman et al. 1997). Both positions have about the same integrated intensity ICO .\nWith the standard value of X, NGC 2535 has M(H2 )/M(HI) = 0.1. In NGC 5394, most\nof the CO emission is from the central 800 pc starburst region, and the ratio of molecular\u2013\nto\u2013atomic gas for the galaxy is typical of a starburst. Thus in prograde grazing encounters,\nthere appears to be a time delay before conditions become suitable for a starburst. The\nlength of the time delay depends on how rapidly post\u2013encounter evolution proceeds. This\nsmall sample of three prograde encounters suggests that a central starburst may not develop\nuntil near the end of the ocular phase.\nIt appears that the encounter caused a considerable amount of gas to lose angular\nmomentum and fall into the center of NGC 5394, produced the lopsided distribution of gas\nin its inner disk, and may have increased the M(H2 )/M(HI) ratio for the galaxy as a result\nof the conversion of atomic to molecular gas in the high density central region.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n9.\n\nNGC 5395 Results\n\nWe expected to find a compressed molecular ridge or clumped molecular gas at the\nfollowing locations in NGC 5395: (1) in the dominant spiral arm on the eastern side of\nNGC 5395, since this coincides with a prominent radio continuum ridge (see Paper I); (2)\nin a stellar plus ionized gas \"shell\u2013like\" structure (20\u2032\u2032 in diameter, marked on the NE side\nof NGC 5395 in Fig. 1) which Paper I interpreted as a caustic produced by temporary\nconvergence of orbits; (3) in the prominent dust lanes along the dominant spiral arm on the\nwestern side of NGC 5395. On the eastern side of the galaxy, the dominant spiral arm is\nbrighter in radio continuum and H\u03b1 emission, whereas on the western side of the galaxy, it is\nbrighter in HI. The face\u2013on surface density of HI plus helium (measured with 11\u2032\u2032 resolution\nin Paper I) is 16 \u2013 20 M\u2299 pc\u22122 at Onsala position H (at the main dust lane on the western\nside of NGC 5395) and 10 M\u2299 pc\u22122 at the caustic. NGC 5395 has an inclination of 65\u25e6 .\nWe compare the 12 CO J = 1 \u2192 0 observations of NGC 5395 by the NRAO 12\u2013m telescope (beam = 55\u2032\u2032 HPBW) (Zhu et al. 1999) and by Onsala (beam = 33\u2032\u2032 HPBW) (Paper\nI) with the BIMA data presented here. None of these data sets has complete coverage of the\ngalaxy. With three pointings at a spacing of 60\u2032\u2032 , Zhu et al. (1999) measured a total integrated flux SCO of 325 \u00b1 26 Jy km s\u22121 , equivalent to M(H2 ) = 7.1 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 with a standard\nvalue of X. They then multiplied this flux by a factor of 1.7 to include CO emission outside\nof the region covered. Since M(HI) is 1.4 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 (Paper I), applying this factor gives\nan M(H2 )/M(HI) ratio of 0.86, so NGC 5395, which does not have a central starburst, is\nsomewhat CO\u2013rich compared to the typical spirals in the survey by Casoli et al. (1998) but\nnot as CO\u2013rich as its companion.\nAll three NRAO 12\u2013m profiles have very broad CO linewidths (Zhu et al. 1999). Correcting these for the HI velocity gradient across the CO beam and assuming that the CO\nemission fills the NRAO beamwidth parallel to the kinematic major axis (position angle =\n173\u25e6 ) results in a one-dimensional CO velocity dispersion of \u223c 80 km s\u22121 . This is similar\nto the HI velocity dispersions of 50 \u2013 70 km s\u22121 found in Paper I. As in the case of the HI\nline widths, the large value for the velocity dispersion probably results mainly because the\nline\u2013of\u2013sight intercepts gas at various radial distances in the disk and at various altitudes\nabove the plane. Paper I presented evidence for three\u2013dimensional disturbed structures in\nthe HI gas. The broad CO linewidths suggest that molecular gas may also participate in\nthese three dimensional structures.\nThe Onsala and BIMA observations of NGC 5395 were not sufficiently sensitive to\ndetect the molecular gas with high velocity dispersion seen by the NRAO 12\u2013m. The Onsala\nobservations detected a CO component with low velocity dispersion in the northern part\nof the ring/pseudo ring and measured an SCO of 126 Jy km s\u22121 from the two pointings\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n(labelled H and I in Fig. 1) centered 40\u2032\u2032 north of the nucleus. At positions H and I, the\nOnsala line profiles have FWHM line widths of 77 km s\u22121 and 69 km s\u22121 , respectively, and\ncentral velocities of 3314 km s\u22121 and 3328 km s\u22121 (close to the HI mean velocities). From\nthe HI velocity field (Paper I), we find a velocity gradient of 3.8 km s\u22121 arcsec\u22121 at position\nH and 2.8 km s\u22121 arcsec\u22121 at position I. If the CO emission fills the Onsala beam uniformly\nalong the kinematic major axis, then the velocity gradient would produce a velocity difference\nacross the beam of 125 km s\u22121 at position H and 90 km s\u22121 at position I. Since these values\nare appreciably greater than the FWHM linewidths observed by Onsala, the CO emission\ndoes not fill the Onsala beam uniformly along the gradient of the velocity field (approximately\nnorth\u2013south). The NRAO 12\u2013m position 60\u2032\u2032 north of the nucleus includes part of Onsala\npositions H and I and the caustic feature. Its line profile consists of a narrow component\nwith v = 3300 \u2013 3360 km s\u22121 (the same velocity range as the emission found by Onsala at\npositions H and I) sitting atop the fainter, broad component with FWHM = 230 km s\u22121\n(Zhu et al. 1999).\nThe BIMA observations detect very little CO emission from NGC 5395. In Figure 14,\ncontours from BIMA channel maps for the appropriate velocity range are overlaid on the\nDigitized Sky Survey image in gray\u2013scale for a field containing the stellar caustic feature and\npositions H and I. This displays the best detection of CO emission in the BIMA observations\nof NGC 5395: a feature at the intersection of positions H and I with maximum ICO = 13 K\nkm s\u22121 = 3.7\u00d7 the rms noise and SCO = 6 Jy km s\u22121 , which is 5% of the SCO measured by\nOnsala from the two pointings H and I. Its location mainly interior to the arc formed by the\nstellar caustic is surprising as we had expected to find the CO emission in this field along\nthe stellar caustic. The only other possible CO feature in Figure 14 is, at best, a marginal\ndetection on the arm just south of the stellar caustic. The two channel at 2\u00d7 rms noise\nupper limit in this field corresponds to a face\u2013on surface density, including helium, of 15\nM\u2299 pc\u22122 for a standard value of X.\nIt is puzzling that BIMA missed almost all of the narrow velocity component to the CO\nemission at Onsala positions H and I. If the emission measured by Onsala were clumped in a\nlinear feature 33\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 6.5\u2032\u2032 , BIMA should have detected position H at 8.9\u00d7 the rms noise and\nposition I at 4.7\u00d7 the rms noise (averaging the BIMA sensitivity over the Onsala aperture).\nThe constraint imposed by the Onsala linewidth implies that the CO emission detected by\nOnsala has a N\u2013S extent \u2264 20\u2032\u2032 at position H and \u2264 25\u2032\u2032 at position I. If the CO feature\nhas dimensions 20\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 33\u2032\u2032 , then it could be below 2\u00d7 the rms noise at position I in the\nBIMA observations but it should have been present at 2.9\u00d7 the rms noise at position H in\nthe BIMA data. It may be that across the northern end of the HI, H\u03b1, radio continuum\nring/pseudo\u2013ring of NGC 53945, there is a 20\u2032\u2032 wide band of CO emission, possibly consisting\nof small, unresolved, molecular clouds, and that the E\u2013W extent of the CO emission exceeds\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nthe largest scale visible to BIMA in C configuration.\nSince the BIMA observations detected very little CO emission from NGC 5395, the\nmolecular gas does not appear to be strongly concentrated in compressed ridges where we\nexpected to find strong shock fronts. We are left with the puzzle that the eastern half of the\nring/pseudo\u2013ring is brighter in radio continuum and H\u03b1 emission, whereas the western half\nhas a higher column density of total gas.\nZhu et al. (1999) found an SCO of 166 \u00b1 17 Jy km s\u22121 (380 km s\u22121 FWHM) from the\ncentral NRAO 12\u2013m pointing,14 but neither Onsala nor BIMA detect CO emission from the\nnuclear region of NGC 5395. The discrepancy between the Onsala and NRAO 12\u2013m results\nat this location can be explained if most of the central CO emission seen by the NRAO 12\u2013m\ncomes from the dominant spiral arm on the eastern side of NGC 5395 (not the nucleus) and\nfills the NRAO beamwidth parallel to the major axis of the galaxy. The nucleus is also faint\nin the radio continuum (see Paper I).\n\n10.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe spiral galaxy NGC 5394 has suffered a recent, prograde, grazing encounter with\nthe spiral galaxy NGC 5395 (Paper I). In NGC 5394, we find (1) 80% of the CO emission\ndetected by BIMA comes from the central 800 pc starburst region, (2) the gas distribution in\nthe disk is lopsided, with more CO, H\u03b1, and HI emission from the western or southwestern\nside, and (3) CO and H\u03b1 emission are detected from the innermost western arm but not\nfrom the optically very bright, eastern or the outer\u2013western inner\u2013disk arms. The HI velocity\ndispersion in the disk is several times higher than in undisturbed spiral galaxies (see Paper\nI), and the CO velocity dispersion at the innermost western arm is somewhat higher than\nnormal. These properties appear to result from the tidal encounter: in an encounter simulation that reproduces some of the main features of this galaxy pair, a considerable amount of\ngas in NGC 5394 falls into the central region early in the collision. Previous studies (Paper\nI) concluded that the galaxies IC 2163, NGC 2535, and NGC 5394 form three distinct stages\nin the development of structures in prograde, grazing encounters, with NGC 5394 the most\nevolved interaction in this set. Of the three, only NGC 5394 has a central starburst with a\nhigh concentration of molecular gas there, which suggests, for similar types of encounters, a\ncentral starburst may not develop until near the end of the ocular phase.\n14\n\nM. Zhu, private communication, points out that the value of the peak Tmb was misprinted in their Table\n2A as 31.8 mK instead of 18.3 mK.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nStar formation in the disk of NGC 5394 follows the gas distribution. Upper limits\non the CO integrated intensity at the eastern inner\u2013disk arm suggest that the instability\nparameter Qgas is presently too high for significant star formation there. So the question of\nwhy there is no evidence of ongoing star formation at the eastern inner\u2013disk arm is really\nthe question of why the distribution of molecular gas is lopsided. This is probably the result\nof an asymmetry in the collisional perturbation plus the gas losing angular momentum in\nshocks and may be related to the west versus east time lag in the development of the ocular\noval in the model.\nKaufman et al. (1997) noted that widespread, high velocity dispersion in the HI gas\nis observed in the disks of a number of interacting spiral galaxies during an early phase\nof post\u2013encounter evolution. With the BIMA observations of NGC 5394, we have some\nevidence that enhanced turbulence in the disk is also present in the molecular gas. The\nmeasured component of the velocity dispersion in NGC 5394 should represent mainly the\nz\u2013component. In NGC 5395, the broad CO linewidths in the NRAO 12-m observations by\nZhu et al. (1999) indicate high velocity dispersions similar to those in the HI gas. Although\nmolecular gas with high velocity dispersion has been found previously in merger remnants\nand in the nuclear regions of normal galaxies (Casoli et al. 1991; Bally et al. 1988), our\nresults indicate that molecular gas with high velocity dispersion may also occur in the disks\nof galaxies involved in a grazing encounter.\nIf standard values are used for the conversion factor X = N(H2 )/ICO and the dust\u2013to\u2013\ngas ratio, then the average extinction of the NGC 5394 starburst implied by the integrated\nCO intensity ICO is a factor of 3 \u2013 4 greater than that deduced from comparison of the radio\ncontinuum, H\u03b1, and 60 \u03bcm luminosities. From this we conclude that the value of X in the\nstarburst is a factor of 3 \u2013 4 below the standard value. This adds the starburst region in\nNGC 5394 to the list of nuclear starbursts in which the value of X is below the standard\nvalue. The CO position\u2013velocity diagram of the nucleus of NGC 5394 reveals two separate\nvelocity features very close to the center. This may indicate a nuclear ring or the \"twin\npeaks\" of an inner ILR or some destruction of CO at the nucleus by photodissociation or\nconsumption in star formation.\nVery little of the CO emission detected from NGC 5395 in single\u2013dish observations is seen\nin the BIMA data, and thus the molecular gas does not appear to be strongly concentrated\nin compressed ridges. We are left with the puzzle that on the eastern side of NGC 5395, the\nring/pseudo\u2013ring is brighter in radio continuum and H\u03b1 emission, whereas on the western\nside of NGC 5395, it has a higher column density of total gas.\nThis research made use of the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), which is\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\noperated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract\nwith the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

The circles labelled B, H, and I denote the Onsala\nHPBW at the positions where CO emission was clearly detected by Onsala Space Observatory. Position B contains the bright inner\u2013disk arms and starburst nucleus of NGC 5394.\nThe field observed in 12 CO J = 1 \u2192 0 in the BIMA observations presented here is indicated\nby the two oval contours marked \"PB,\" which represent the 50% and the 90% sensitivity\ncontours of the combined primary\u2013beams after the two pointings were mosaiced. In NGC\n5394 all of the CO emission clearly detected in the BIMA data is from the central and\nsouthwestern portion of Position B. The stellar feature in NGC 5395 labelled \"caustic 1\"\nwas interpreted in Paper I as a caustic produced by temporary convergence of orbits.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\n\n37 42 00\n\n3398.0 KM/S\n\n3408.0 KM/S\n\n3418.0 KM/S\n\n3428.0 KM/S\n\n3438.0 KM/S\n\n3448.0 KM/S\n\n3458.0 KM/S\n\n3468.0 KM/S\n\n3478.0 KM/S\n\n3488.0 KM/S\n\n3498.0 KM/S\n\n3508.0 KM/S\n\n41 30\n00\n40 30\n\n37 42 00\n41 30\n00\n\nDECLINATION (B1950)\n\n40 30\n\n37 42 00\n41 30\n00\n40 30\n\n37 42 00\n41 30\n00\n40 30\n\n13 56 30\n28\n26 24\nRIGHT ASCENSION (B1950)\n\n13 56 30\n\n28\n\n26\n\n24\n\nFig. 2.- Channels maps from the BIMA CO cube overlaid as contours on a gray\u2013scale\ndisplay of the Digitized Sky Survey image for the range of velocities appropriate to NGC\n5394.
