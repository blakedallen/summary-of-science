RESCIGNO FOR THE CDF COLLABORATION\nINFN, Sezione di Roma 1, P.le Aldo Moro 5, 00185 Roma, Italy\nE-mail: marco.rescigno@roma1.infn.it\nWe present the first evidence of the decay mode Bs \u2192\u03c6\u03c6 and a measurement of partial width and direct\nCP asymmetry for the B + \u2192 \u03c6K + decay using 180 pb\u22121 of data collected by the CDF II experiment\nat the Fermilab Tevatron collider. We measure: BR(Bs \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6) = (1.4 \u00b1 0.6(stat.) \u00b1 0.2(syst.) \u00b1\n0.5(BR)) * 10\u22125 , where the last error is due to the uncertainty on the Bs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 branching ratio\nused as normalization, BR(B + \u2192 \u03c6K + ) = (7.2 \u00b1 1.3(stat.) \u00b1 0.7(syst.)) * 10\u22126 and ACP (B + \u2192\n\u03c6K + ) = \u22120.07\u00b10.17(stat.) +0.06\n\u22120.05 (syst.). We also briefly discuss prospects for studying other charmless\nB \u2192 V V decays at CDF\n\nSeveral precision measurements on Bu,d\nmeson decays are available, yet many crucial theory predictions on Bs mesons, including mixing, CP violation and the decay\nwidth difference, \u2206\u0393s , are still to be tested.\nBs \u2192 V V decays offer insights to both CP\nviolation and \u2206\u0393s thank to the presence of\nCP-odd and CP-even components in the decay amplitude. Bs \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decays are the first\ncharmless Bs \u2192 V V to be observed. This\nchannel has been considered extensively in\nthe literature 1 , even as a probe for New\nPhysics along with other Bs modes. A recent calculation 2 predicts a branching ratio\nof 3.7 * 10\u22125 . In the Standard Model (SM)\nthe decay is mediated by b\u2192ss\u0304s penguin amplitudes which have shown discrepancies with\nthe SM predictions, confirmed by recent data,\nfor certain CP asymmetry measurements 3 .\nB \u00b1\u2192\u03c6K \u00b1 decays are mediated by the same\nquark-level transition and have been already\nstudied at B-factories 4 . Measuring precisely\nrates and CP violation parameters in as many\nsuch decays as possible may help in determining the source of the above discrepancies.\nWe report the first evidence of the Bs \u2192\n\u03c6\u03c6 decay and the first measurement, at\nhadron colliders, of CP-averaged BR and direct CP asymmetry (ACP ) for B + \u2192 \u03c6K +\n(charge conjugate modes are implied here unless otherwise stated). In order to cancel the\nproduction cross section uncertainty as well\nas to reduce the systematic uncertainty on\n\ndetector efficiencies, the branching ratios are\nextracted from ratios of decay rates of signals\nand well known B decay modes. In particular\nBs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 and B + \u2192J/\u03c8K + decays, characterized by the same number of secondary\nvertices and charged tracks in the final state\nas our signals, were used respectively in the\nBs\u2192\u03c6\u03c6 and B +\u2192\u03c6K + analysis.\nFor this measurement we rely on the precision measurement of charged particle trajectories reconstructed in the central drift\nchamber (COT) and the silicon detector\n(SVX II). A complete description of the\nCDF II detector can be found elsewhere 5 .\nThe dataset used here was collected by the\ndisplaced track trigger, which is based, at\nLevel 1, on the eXtremely Fast Tracker 6 and,\nat Level 2, on the Silicon Vertex Tracker 7\ndevices. The trigger selection is described in\ndetail elsewhere 8 . In addition a trigger with\nrelaxed requirements was part of the trigger\nmenu with a prescale factor automatically\nadjusted to fill the DAQ bandwidth available at low instantaneous luminosity. We use\n180 pb\u22121 of integrated luminosity, and effectively only 100 pb\u22121 for the prescaled trigger.\nIn this analysis we have used \u03c6\u2192K + K \u2212\nand J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decays. Combinations of\nthree or four tracks with pT > 0.4 GeV/c are\nfit to a common vertex. At least one pair of\ntracks must satisfy the trigger requirements\n(trigger tracks). To isolate J/\u03c8\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 decays at least one muon must be identified in\n\n\fFor Publisher's use\n\n20\n\n25\n\n-1\n\nL = 180 \u00b1 10 pb\n\nCDF RUN II Preliminary\nEvents / 0.167\n\n\u00b1\n\n47 \u00b1 8 events\n\nEvents / 2 MeV/c 2\n\nEvents / 20 MeV/c 2\n\nB\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6 K\n\n25\n\n-1\n\nL = 180 \u00b1 10 pb\n\nCDF RUN II Preliminary\n30\n\n50\n\n40\n\n25\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n5\n\n0\n1\n\n5.2\n\n5.3\n\n5.4\n\n5.5\n5.6\n2\nMKKK [GeV/c ]\n\n35\n30\n\n30\n\n5.1\n\n40\n\n20\n15\n\n15\n\n-1\n\nL = 180 \u00b1 10 pb\n\nCDF RUN II Preliminary\nEvents / 0.2\n\n-1\n\nL = 180 \u00b1 10 pb\n\nCDF RUN II Preliminary\n30\n\n15\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n1.01\n\n1.02\n\n1.03\n\n1.04\n\n1.05\n1.06\n2\nMKK [GeV/c ]\n\n0\n-1\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n1\ncos \u03b8K+\n\n0\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\nID\n\nFigure 1.

Requiring the B flight\ndirection to point back to the primary vertex decreases background from partially reconstructed decays and selecting good quality vertices background from mis-measured\ntracks. The cut values on the discriminating\n\u221a variables were selected maximizing\nS/ S + B for the already observed B +\n\u221a\u2192\n\u03c6K + signal, and maximizing S/(1.5 + B)\nfor Bs \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6, whose branching ratio was unknown. The latter choice is equivalent to\nmaximize the experiment potential to reach a\n3\u03c3 observation of a new signal 9 . In the above\nexpressions the background, B, is represented\nby appropriately normalized data selected in\nthe same way as the signal except for requiring the two kaon invariant mass to be in the \u03c6\nsideband region:1.04 < mKK < 1.06 GeV/c2 .\nThe signal, S, is derived from a Monte Carlo\n(MC) simulation of the CDF II detector and\ntrigger. For Bs \u2192\u03c6\u03c6 a blind analysis was performed. The signal region was hidden until\nafter all the selection requirements were fixed\nand background evaluated.\nB + \u2192 \u03c6K + candidates are selected requiring: vertex goodness-of-fit \u03c72 < 8, decay\nlength Lxy > 350 \u03bcm, B + reconstructed impact parameter dB\n0 < 100 \u03bcm, non-trigger\ntrack transverse momentum psoft\n> 1.3\nT\nGeV/c and impact parameter dsoft\n> 120\n0\n\u03bcm. We further require that IR<1 > 0.5,\n\nwhere IR is defined as the ratio of the B +\ncandidate pT over the total transverse momentapof all tracks within a cone of radius\nR = (\u2206\u03b7 2 + \u2206\u03c62 ) around the B flight direction.

Data are fit to seven categories: signal, partially reconstructed b \u2192\n\u03c6X decays, combinatorial background, B + \u2192\nK \u22170 (892)\u03c0 + and three B decay modes which\npeak in the signal region, including B + \u2192\nf0 (980)K + and non-resonant decays. The\nlatter contributions are fixed by their relative decay rates and detection efficiencies\nto the B + \u2192 K \u22170 (892)\u03c0 + one, which is determined from the fit. A combination of\nMonte Carlo simulation and sideband data\nwas used to model the signal and background\nshapes.

World\naverage 4 \u03c6, J/\u03c8 and B +\u2192J/\u03c8K + partial\nwidths are used. The muon efficiency, \u01eb\u03bc =\n0.810 \u00b1 0.021, is determined in a sample of\ninclusive J/\u03c8. Systematic uncertainties on\nsignal yield and asymmetry are evaluated by\nvarying the parameterizations used in the\nlikelihood fit, including the shape of the f0\nresonance. For the branching ratio determination we consider also the uncertainty\non the relative detection efficiency, which is\nthe dominant one, and add it in quadrature to the yield uncertainty. For ACP we\nconservatively assign a 5% systematic uncertainty from charge dependent detector asymmetries using the statistical uncertainty on\nthe B + \u2192J/\u03c8K + asymmetry.

A clean signal of 69 \u00b1 10(stat.) \u00b1 5(syst.)\nBs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 events is extracted from a fit to\nthe Bs invariant mass distribution.

From MC simulation we\nexpect a background in the signal peak of\n3.9 \u00b1 1.7 events from Bd \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u22170 decays\nwith a mis-identified kaon.\nThe Bs \u2192\u03c6\u03c6 decay rate is derived from:\nN\u03c6\u03c6 BR (\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc) \u01eb\u03c8\u03c6 \u01eb\u03bc\nBR (\u03c6\u03c6)\n,\n=\nBR (\u03c8\u03c6)\nN\u03c8\u03c6 BR (\u03c6 \u2192 KK) \u01eb\u03c6\u03c6\n\nwhere \u01eb\u03c6\u03c6 /\u01eb\u03c8\u03c6 = 0.816 \u00b1 0.015 and \u01eb\u03bc \u2248\n0.92. We use the world average \u03c6 and J/\u03c8\nbranching ratios 4 and BR(Bs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6) =\n(1.42 \u00b1 0.51) * 10\u22123 , obtained correcting the\nCDF measurement 10 for the current world\naverage fs /fd ratio 4 , to finally derive the result reported in Table 1.\nThe uncertainty on the Bs \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c6 yield\nand background evaluation contribute 6.9%\nto the relative BR systematic error. The efficiency ratio is affected by uncertainties in the\npolarization of the decay vector particles and\nby theory uncertainty on \u2206\u0393s . We conservatively vary the longitudinal polarization of\nthe Bs \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 decay from 0 to 100% and \u2206\u0393s\nin the range 0 < \u2206\u0393s /\u0393s < 0.3. Summing\nin quadrature all contributions we estimate a\ntotal relative systematic uncertainty error on\n\nthe BR(Bs \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6) of 14%. The uncertainty\nfrom BR(Bs \u2192J/\u03c8\u03c6), 36%, is then the dominant one.\nThanks to the new displaced track trigger, CDF is accumulating high quality data\non several other charmless decays. As an example, Fig. 3 shows the invariant mass of\nBd \u2192 \u03c6K \u22170 candidates, reconstructed in a\nsimilar way as the Bs \u2192\u03c6\u03c6 above, with a signal of \u223c 60 events and S/B > 3. It will allow\nprecision measurement of polarization and\nnicely illustrates the CDF potential to exploit\nlight vector resonances in Bs decays. With\ntwo to three times the data used here CDF\nshould detect a signal of Bs \u2192 K \u22170 K\u0304 \u22170 with\nan expected 2 BR of \u2248 3.7 * 10\u22126 .\nIn summary, we have shown the first evidence of Bs \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 and measure: BR(Bs \u2192\n\u03c6\u03c6) = (1.4\u00b10.6(stat.)\u00b10.2(syst.)\u00b10.5(BR))*\n10\u22125 . For the B + \u2192 \u03c6K + channel we measure the partial width and ACP which agree\nwith available measurements 4 within uncertainties.\nReferences\n1. M. Raidal, Phys. Rev.
