Many, perhaps most, stars\nform in clustered environments where massive stars are present (Lada 1992,\nWilliams & McKee 1997). Only massive star formation is readily studied at the\ndistances of other galaxies. In particular, the discovery that star formation at\nsubstantial redshifts is often heavily obscured by dust (e.g., Frayer et al. 2000;\nChapman et al. 2001) indicates that study of the history of star formation in\ngalaxies, hence the major part of galaxy formation, can be related to what we\nlearn about massive star formation in our own and nearby galaxies.\nHere we consider a number of issues surrounding the formation of massive\nstars, beginning with a comparison to what we know about the formation of\nlow mass stars, proceeding through some systematic studies of early stages of\nmassive star formation, and ending with some speculations about the initial\nconditions for massive star formation.\n2.\n\nAn Evolutionary Paradigm?\n\nIn the case of low mass stars, a well-established evolutionary paradigm prevails,\nand a standard model of star formation (Shu et al. 1987) provides a detailed target for observational tests. Various alternative models have also been proposed\n1\n\n\f2\n\nEvans et al.\n\nand observers are beginning to compare these models to observations. The evolutionary paradigm is based on the class system (Lada & Wilking 1984, Lada\n1987), originally proceeding from Class I (deeply embedded) to III (revealed\nstar, weak-line T Tauri star) via Class II (roughly the same as classical T Tauri\nstars).\nThe recent advances in submillimeter capability have revealed a self-luminous\nphase that is still more embedded than Class I, and Andr\u00e9, Ward-Thompson,\n& Barsony (1993) called this phase Class 0. The initial conditions for low mass\nstar formation appear to be amenable to study in dense regions without any evidence for internal luminosity. Variously called Pre-Protostellar Cores (PPCs),\npre-stellar cores, or Class \u22121 sources, these objects first became obvious as peaks\nof submillimeter emission. While they roughly coincide with molecular emission\nregions, the molecular line emission did not directly reveal the high densities,\napparently because of substantial molecular depletion (e.g., Caselli et al. 2001),\ncaused by the high densities and low temperatures in the cores of these regions.\nThe temperatures are low enough (TD \u223c 7 K) that even the submillimeter emission is decreased toward the centers (Evans et al. 2001), but the dust continuum\nemission is much more revealing than the molecular line emission that has usually been used to trace dense regions.\nThe extended class system relies on a mixture of slopes (Lada & Wilking\n1984, Lada 1987), peaks, and ratios (Andr\u00e9 et al. 1993) in the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of dust emission. An alternative that unifies these methods\nand provides a continuous variable is the bolometric temperature (Tbol ) introduced by Myers & Ladd (1993). Chen et al. (1995) showed that the class\nboundaries corresponded well to certain values of Tbol . However, Tbol , being\ndefined by the spectrally averaged mean frequency, can be heavily affected by\nemission at relatively short wavelengths, where geometrical effects are conflated\nwith evolutionary effects. For the early stages, there are two important boundaries: Class \u22121 to Class 0; and Class 0 to Class I. There are usually insufficient\nmeasurements to define Tbol for Class \u22121 sources; the test for Class \u22121 status\nis that there is no evidence for internal luminosity. For the Class 0/I boundary,\none can use either Tbol = 70K (Chen et al. 1995) or the ratio of emission beyond\n350 \u03bcm to total luminosity, Lsubmm /L (Andr\u00e8 et al. 1993).\nTo what extent can we carry the observational paradigm and theoretical\nmodels for low-mass star formation over to the case of massive star formation?\nWorking with a modest sample size (14), van der Tak et al (2000) found rather\npoor correlations between different potential tracers of age. It is not very surprising that the SED may not correlate with evolution in the same way as for\nlow mass stars; for massive stars forming in clusters, the SED will be dominated\nby the most luminous object that is still embedded and the evolution of the\nvarious objects is unlikely to be highly synchronized. The Class II phase in\nparticular may have little meaning: for low mass stars, this is the phase when\nthe SED is dominated by a disk; the presence of disks around massive stars is\nless firmly established. Finally, the evolution of massive stars is so much faster\nthat we cannot expect the gentle unfolding of the SED as the dust moves from\nenvelope to disk to star in the low mass case. Instead, massive stars reach the\nmain sequence, form HII regions, blow ionized winds, etc. before much of the\nmaterial in the envelope has fallen in.\n\n\fEarly Phases and Initial Conditions for Massive Star Formation\n\n3\n\nWhat other evolutionary tracers might prove useful? Clearly, the emergence\nof an HII region, first as an ultra-compact HII region, marks an important evolutionary boundary. If we are looking for the earliest stages, we want to study\nsources before UC HII regions form. There are two general ideas for evolutionary\ntracers at earlier times: masers and chemical signatures. While OH masers appear to be associated with HII regions, H2 O and possibly CH3 OH (e.g., Minier,\nConway, & Booth 2001) masers appear to be associated with early stages, when\nmolecular outflows produce shocks. Hot cores (warm, dense, chemically-rich\nregions) also appear to precede UC HII regions (see van der Tak 2002 for a discussion of this approach). The hot cores could in principal be heated internally\n(and hence analogous to Class 0 sources) or externally (hence analogous to Class\n\u22121 sources).\nThere have been many detailed studies of individual regions of massive\nstar formation, but systematic studies of large samples of regions using uniform\nanalytical methods are just becoming available (e.g., Plume et al. 1992, 1997,\nBronfman et al. 1996, Sridharan et al. 2001). In the next section, we report on\nrecent work on the sample identified by Plume et al. (1992).\n\n3.\n\nStudies of Regions Associated with Water Masers\n\nWater masers provide a large sample of objects with accurate positions for further study (e.g., Cesaroni et al. 1988). Many masers are near UC HII regions,\nbut their positions do not coincide, consistent with the masers revealing an earlier stage. In addition, the presence of a H2 O maser ensures the existence of\nsome very dense gas. The models of these masers also require shocks, suggesting that some star formation and associated outflow has begun. Consequently,\nwe have pursued a series of studies of the gas and dust in the directions of water masers, beginning with a survey for emission in the J = 7 \u2192 6 transition of\nCS (Plume, Jaffe, & Evans 1992). A large fraction of the maser sources were\ndetected in the CS J = 7 \u2192 6 survey, leading to a follow-up study using CS\nJ = 2 \u2192 1, J = 3 \u2192 2, J = 5 \u2192 4, and in a few cases, J = 10 \u2192 9 transitions\nto constrain the density via LVG calculations of the molecular excitation (Plume\net al. 1997). For many sources, C34 S data provided a check on optical depth\neffects in CS. That study found high densities in many sources, with a mean\nin the log of density, n(cm\u22123 ), of hlogni = 5.9, with the average taken over 71\nsources.\nPlume et al. (1997) also mapped a few sources crudely (cross-scans) to\nestimate sizes and masses. To obtain better data on sizes, masses of dense gas,\ndensity distributions, etc., we have made fully sampled maps of a large fraction\nof the Plume et al. sample. We mapped 63 regions in CS J = 5 \u2192 4 (Shirley\net al. 2002) and 24 regions in CS J = 7 \u2192 6 (Knez et al. 2002). In addition,\nwe have mapped the 350 \u03bcm continuum emission from dust toward 51 of these\nregions (Mueller et al. 2002). Details of the observations and analysis can be\nfound in those papers, and a more complete study of one of the objects can be\nfound in Lee et al. (2002). Here we focus on the overall results, summarizing and\ncomparing the results from the different tracers, while accounting for differences\namong the samples in the different studies.\n\n\f4\n\nEvans et al.\n\nFor all the samples, the FWHM size of each core was determined by deconvolving the telescope main beam FWHM from the observed FWHM of the\ncore. In most cases, the deconvolved angular sizes determined in this way were\nslightly larger than the beam size, characteristic of a power-law emission distribution (Terebey et al. 1993). Also, the CS J = 7 \u2192 6 sizes were smaller than\nthe CS J = 5 \u2192 4 sizes, as expected for a centrally peaked density distribution because the critical density for the J = 7 \u2192 6 line is 3 times greater than\nthat for the J = 5 \u2192 4 line (cf. Evans 1999). For power law distributions, the\nsize defined in this way should not be considered a physical boundary. Instead,\nwe use it, along with the distance, to calculate a fiducial radius for convenient\ncomparisons.\nSimilarly, the mass in a power law distribution can only be specified for a\ngiven radius; when comparing masses from various techniques, it is important to\ncompare for the same fiducial radius. Because the CS J = 5 \u2192 4 maps have the\nlargest extents, thus tracing the core farther down the density distribution, we\ncompare all masses calculated to be inside the radius of the CS emission: rCS =\n(D/2)\u03b8s , where \u03b8s is the FWHM angular extent of the map of CS J = 5 \u2192 4\nemission and D is the distance.\n3.1.\n\nModels\n\nFigure 1.\nThe modeling scheme is shown, with the modeling of dust\nemission following the top loop and the modeling of emission from gas\nfollowing the bottom loop. Not all steps are fully implemented yet.\n\n\f5\n\nEarly Phases and Initial Conditions for Massive Star Formation\n\nThe modeling follows the scheme represented by Figure 1, though at present\nsome of the processes are incompletely implemented. The modeling of the dust\nemission is described by Mueller et al. (2002). A density power law (n(r) =\nn0 (r/r0 )\u2212p ) is assumed, a radiative transport code is used to compute a selfconsistent TD (r), and the resulting TD (r) and n(r) are used to compute the\ndust emission over the full SED. For comparison with maps of submillimeter\ncontinuum emission, the emission is convolved with the measured beam response\nand chopping is simulated. Comparison of the predicted intensity profile to that\nobtained in the observations allows one to choose the best fitting power law index\nfor the density. Comparison to the observed integral of the SED constrains the\ninternal luminosity of the forming stars, while comparison to the emission at\nsubmillimeter wavelengths constrains n0 and hence the mass. The mass also\ndepends on the assumed opacity at 350 \u03bcm (\u03ba\u03bd (350)), and the overall shape\nof the SED depends on the full behavior of the dust opacity as a function of\nfrequency (\u03ba\u03bd (\u03bd)). We assume the dust opacities given in column 5 of Ossenkopf\nand Henning (1994), hereafter OH5, but divide by 100 so that are given per gram\nof total mass (gas plus dust). These opacities have fit the SEDs from both lowmass (Evans et al. 2001, Shirley et al. 2001) and high-mass (van der Tak et\nal. 2000) star formation regions. They are appropriate for grains that have\ncoagulated at high density and accreted thin ice mantles. Different choices for\nopacities make little difference in the optimum p, but they do affect the mass\nbecause only the product M \u03ba\u03bd (350) enters the equation for the dust emission.\n8\n\n8\n\nLow\nMass\n\nHigh\nMass\n6\n\nN\n\nN\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\np\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\np\n\nFigure 2.\nHistograms of p, best-fit density power law exponents for\nhigh-mass star forming regions on the left (Mueller et al. 2002) and for\nlow-mass star forming regions on the right (Shirley et al. 2001, Young\net al. 2001). All are based on modeling the radial distribution of the\nsubmillimeter continuum emission from dust.\nFor the 28 sources with models, Mueller et al. (2002) find a mean density\nindex of hpi = 1.72 \u00b1 0.37, with a distribution shown in Figure 2 (left panel).\nThis value is considerably larger than that found by van der Tak et al. (2000),\nwho modeled a subset of these sources. For that earlier work, the beam was\n\n\f6\n\nEvans et al.\n\napproximated as a Gaussian, while the observed beam, including azimuthally\naveraged sidelobes, was used in the models by Mueller et al. (2002). For sharply\npeaked intensity distributions, the details of the beam profile make a substantial\ndifference; source-by-source comparison indicates that Mueller et al. find values\nof p larger than those found by van der Tak et al. by about 0.4 on average.\nThe hpi found by Mueller et al. (2002) is consistent within the uncertainties\nwith that found by Beuther et al. (2001) (hpi = 1.6 \u00b1 0.5) for a differentlyselected sample of regions forming massive stars. These power-law indices are\nalso similar in the mean to those found for isolated cores forming low mass\nstars (Shirley et al. 2000, 2001; Young et al. 2001; Motte & Andr\u00e9 2001). In\nFigure 2, right panel, we show the histogram for the combined sample of lowmass cores modeled by Shirley et al. (2001) and Young et al. (2001), for which\nhpi = 1.63 \u00b1 0.40. While the means agree, the distributions may be different,\nthough larger samples are still needed. The low-mass regions primarily have\np \u223c 2; the smaller peak between 1 and 1.5 is composed of sources that are quite\naspherical. The distribution of p for regions forming massive stars appears to\nhave a larger intrinsic spread.\nThe detailed modeling of the CS emission (Knez et al. 2002) is at an early\nstage, with only one source (M8E) modeled, and some of the processes in the\nbottom loop of Figure 1 are incompletely implemented. In particular, we use\nthe TD (r) from the dust modeling and currently assume TK = TD (a good\nassumption at the densities probed by CS emission). The turbulent velocity\ndispersion is assumed to be constant, and no systematic motions (e.g., collapse)\nare assumed. Instead of running a chemical model, we assume a constant CS\nabundance, which is adjusted to match the optically thin emission from C34 S\nJ = 5 \u2192 4. Various values of p were used to allow a determination independent from that of the dust emission. For M8E, the CS prefers a slightly lower\nvalue of p than the dust: 1.6 rather than 1.75. Given the uncertainties and the\nassumptions, these are in quite good agreement.\n3.2.\n\nMasses\n\nMueller et al. (2002) find a mean mass of gas and dust based on the dust\nemission within the FWHM of the 350 \u03bcm emission, hMD i = 209M\u2299 . Because\nthe submillimeter emission has the smallest beam, and because the submillimeter\nsample does not include the more massive cores in the full sample, this mass is\nmuch less than the mean virial mass, hMV i = 4550M\u2299 , determined from the CS\nemission (Shirley et al. 2002). In addition, that estimate of virial mass assumed\nconstant density and used the FWHM velocity width of the CS J = 5 \u2192 4 line,\nwhich is broadened by optical depth effects. We can correct the virial mass MV\nfor the density power law index, according to (Bertoldi & McKee 1992),\n2\n5(1 \u2212 2p\n5 )rCS \u2206v\nMV =\np\n8ln2G(1 \u2212 3 )\n\nwhere the factor 8ln2 comes from converting from mean square velocity to\nFWHM linewidth (\u2206v), and rCS is the radius defined above for the CS J = 5 \u2192 4\nemission. For this calculation, we use the FWHM of the C34 S line, which corrects for saturation broadening of the CS lines. Preliminary comparisons of 13 CS\n\n\f7\n\nEarly Phases and Initial Conditions for Massive Star Formation\n20\n\n1400\n\n1200\n15\n1000\n\nN\n\n800\n\n10\n\n600\n5\n\n400\n\n200\n0\n0\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1\n\n1500\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFigure 3.\nThe corrected CS virial mass (density power law and\nlinewidth broadening corrected) compared to the total (gas plus dust)\nmass based on models of the dust emission for 18 sources (left) and the\ncorrected CS virial mass histogram for the entire sample of 57 sources\n(right).\nand C34 S spectra indicate that C34 S J = 5 \u2192 4 linewidths are not broadened\ndue to optical depth effects.\nFor comparison, we calculate the total mass based on the model of the dust\nemission, but integrated out to the same radius (rCS ) as used for the virial mass:\nMD =\n\n4\u03c0\u03bcmH n0\nr0\u2212p\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nrCS\n\nr 2\u2212p dr =\n\n3\u2212p\n4\u03c0\u03bcmH n0 rCS\n(3 \u2212 p)r0\u2212p\n\nwhere \u03bcmH is the mean molecular mass and n0 is the density at r0 . Because\nthe value of n0 is fixed by matching the observed flux density at 350 \u03bcm,\nn0 \u221d 1/\u03ba\u03bd (350). The ratio of the virial mass to the total (gas and dust) mass\ndetermined from the dust modeling then depends on measured and assumed\nquantities as follows:\np\u22122\np\u22122\n/n0 \u221d \u2206v 2 \u03ba\u03bd (350)rCS\nMV /MD \u221d \u2206v 2 rCS\n\nFor the 18 sources with all the required data and models, hMV /MD i = 2.4 \u00b1 1.4\n(see Figure 3). Because the opacities from different dust models vary by up to a\nfactor of 10 (e.g., Ossenkopf & Henning 1994), this discrepancy is not very large.\nThe agreement of the two very different mass estimates at this level suggests that\nboth the assumptions underlying the virial mass estimate and the OH5 opacities\nat 350 \u03bcm are quite good. A factor of about 2 decrease in \u03ba\u03bd (350) from the OH5\nvalue would bring them into agreement on average.\nBased on the good agreement of the masses on average, we calculated the\nvirial masses for the rest of the sample, assuming the mean value of p and correcting for linewidth broadening in the CS J = 5 \u2192 4 line statistically (Shirley\n\n\f8\n\nEvans et al.\n\net al. 2002). The resulting mass distribution has a mean value of 2030 \u00b1 620\nM\u2299 . Recall that this number refers to the mass inside rCS ; if the core extends to\ntwice this radius with the same power law in density, the estimate of MV grows\nby a factor of 2, while the mass from dust emission grows by 23\u2212p or a factor\nof 2.4 for the mean p, leading to estimates of 4000 to 4900 M\u2299 , for the mean\nmass. While the mass histogram appears peaked, selection effects against small\nsources are present at the mean distance of sources in this sample: 5.5 \u00b1 3.7 kpc.\nFor sources above 1000 M\u2299 , the distribution could be fitted by a power law in\nmass with an exponent of 1.8 to 2.0 (Shirley et al. 2002).\n3.3.\n\nEvolutionary Indicators\n\nEvolutionary indicators (Tbol , Lsmm /Lbol , and p) for the water maser sample and\nfor low mass protostars observed with SCUBA at 850 and 450 \u03bcm (Young et al.\n2001, Shirley et al. 2001, Evans et al. 2001, Shirley et al. 2000) are plotted in\nFigure 4. Based on the evolutionary scheme for low mass star formation, Tbol\nwould be expected to increase while Lsmm /Lbol would decrease as the envelope\ndissipates. Indeed, for low mass protostars, these trends seem to hold for a small\nsample of sources in the most embedded phases of evolution (PPC through Class\nI). The water maser sources weakly follow a similar trend; however, the water\nmaser sample does not cover as wide a range in Tbol and Lsmm /Lbol as the low\nmass core sample. Preliminary analysis of dust models for both high and low\nmass cores do not indicate a strong correlation of the density power law index,\np, with Tbol . Both samples are biased towards more embedded regions and\ntherefore sample a restricted range of Tbol and Lsmm /Lbol . Each indicator has a\ndifferent dependence of geometrical effects, such as outflow cavities, clumping,\netc. Tbol and Lsmm /Lbol are determined from the SED, while the density power\nlaw index, p, probes the density distribution in a different way. While larger\nsamples covering a wider range of the evolutionary parameters are needed, it\nseems that the traditional evolutionary indicators for low mass star formation\nmay have some utility for massive stars, at least at the early (Class 0 and I)\nstages.\n3.4.\n\nSummary\n\nThe results so far from the study of water maser sources indicate that conditions\nin regions forming massive stars are quite different from those in regions forming\nlow mass stars. The total mass of dense (n \u223c 106 cm\u22123 ) gas is much greater,\nthe turbulence is much higher for a given size, and, once stars have formed, the\ntemperature is much higher. For the subset of sources with adequate data, the\nluminosity to mass ratio is 192\u00b1145 L\u2299 /M\u2299 for the mass of dense gas determined\nfrom the virial mass within rCS . For the masses based on the dust emission,\nthe same ratio is 334 \u00b1 231 L\u2299 /M\u2299 . The latter number may be more relevant\nfor comparison to observations of distant galaxies where long wavelength dust\nemission is used to trace mass. These numbers are for 18 sources that have\nmodels for the dust emission, and are still preliminary until more sources can\nbe added.\nThese values for L/M are much higher than that inferred from CO studies,\nwhich provide masses for the whole molecular cloud. The average value from CO\nstudies is hL/M i = 4 L\u2299 /M\u2299 (Mooney & Solomon 1988) and the distribution\n\n\f9\n\nEarly Phases and Initial Conditions for Massive Star Formation\n\n200\nHigh Mass\n\n150\n\nLow Mass\n\n100\n\nClass 0\n\n50\n\n0\n-3\n\n-2.5\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\n-2.5\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n200\nHigh Mass\n\n150\n\nLow Mass\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\np\n\n2.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\np\n\nFigure 4.\nPotential evolutionary indicators for low and high mass\nstar forming regions.

The dense gas provides a much better\nguide to the star formation rate and efficiency, consistent with the conclusions\nof Gao & Solomon (2000), who showed that HCN correlates much better than\nCO with star formation indicators in a large sample of galaxies. The L/M for\ndense gas is comparable to the values inferred for starburst galaxies, based on\nCO emission: L/M \u223c 100 (Kennicutt 1998, Sanders et al. 1991). Starburst\ngalaxies appear to form stars as if a large fraction of their molecular gas content\nbehaves like the dense cores associated with water masers.\n4.\n\nThe Initial Conditions\n\nSo far, all the regions studied already have ongoing star formation. What initial\nconditions lead to the conditions in the observed regions? By analogy with the\nPre-Protostellar Cores (PPCs) for low mass star formation, the initial conditions\nfor massive, clustered star formation might be referred to as Pre-Proto-cluster\nCores (PPclCs, an acronym chosen deliberately to avoid its future use). Based\non the mean properties of the H2 O maser sample, we would expect the following\nproperties. They would be dense (n \u223c 106 cm\u22123 ) and massive (M \u223c 5000 M\u2299 ).\nThe linewidth is a question: if the turbulence is stirred up by star formation,\nit could be less before star formation begins; however, the virial linewidth for a\ncore of the mean mass would be 7.5 km s\u22121 . Before an internal luminosity source\ndevelops, the PPclC should be very cold on the inside because it is heated only\nexternally by the interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Studies of low-mass PPCs\nindicate TD dropping to 7\u20138 K at the center (Evans et al. 2001, Zucconi et al.\n2001).\nSo far, we have no clear examples of such objects! There are less massive candidates, but nothing we have found in the literature approaches these\nproperties. Why do we lack examples? There are several possible explanations:\n1. PPclCs will be very rare.\n2. Appropriate searches have not been made.\n3. PPclCs never exist.\nThe first explanation arises because massive star formation is rare in general\nand because PPclCs should evolve rapidly to form stars. The second explanation can certainly be part of the answer. The low mass PPCs were found only\nrecently, using submillimeter continuum observations of starless cores originally\nidentified by visual obscuration. While molecular line emission identified the\ngeneral region, the high densities in the PPCs became apparent only with submillimeter dust emission studies. The molecular tracers fail to trace the densest\nregions of PPCs, apparently because of a combination of opacity and heavy\ndepletion onto dust (e.g., Kramer et al. 1999, Caselli et al. 2001). Because\nno obvious signposts like maser emission mark the PPclCs, unbiased submillimeter surveys of large regions of distant molecular clouds are needed to find\nthem. While such surveys are becoming possible and should be attempted, it\nis only fair to note the third explanation. Regions forming clusters may never\ngo through a PPclC phase if lower-mass stars form while the full mass is being\n\n\fEarly Phases and Initial Conditions for Massive Star Formation\n\n11\n\nassembled. In that case, one might see various signposts of lower mass star formation (outflows, infrared emission) associated with a cluster of cores that are\nmerging to form the truly massive cores observed at later stages.\nSome possible candidates for PPclCs may be found from large scale surveys.\nFor example, Lada et al. (1991) surveyed 3.6 square degrees of the L1630 cloud\nin CS J = 2 \u2192 1 emission, finding numerous dense cores. The large cores all\nhad ongoing star formation; follow-up studies (Lada et al. 1997) showed that\nthe starless cores were all of modest mass (M \u223c 10M\u2299 ). The most promising\ncandidates at present are the mid-infrared-dark clouds found by the MSX mission that lack IRAS emission (Egan et al. 1998). Follow-up studies using H2 CO\n(Carey et al. 1998a) found massive (M \u223c 103 M\u2299 ), cold (TD \u223c 10 K) cores with\nn \u223c 106 cm\u22123 . Maps of the submillimeter dust emission (Carey et al. 1998b)\nshowed a string of cores, some of which harbor molecular outflows. The outflows\nindicate that some star formation may have begun, but these objects at least\nseem to be at a very early evolutionary stage.\n4.1.\n\nA Model for the PPclC\n\nTo provide a target for possible searches, we have constructed a model of a\nPPclC based on the mean properties of the H2 O maser sample: M = 4600M\u2299 ,\np = 1.72, and d = 5.5 kpc. The outer radius of the model was taken to be 0.76\npc, twice the mean radius from the CS maps. At the mean distance of 5.5 kpc,\nthis radius translates to \u03b8s = 56\u2032\u2032 . The dust temperature was assumed constant\nat 10 K; while models of PPCs indicate lower TD in the center, PPclCs may exist\nin regions of higher radiation fields. OH5 opacities were assumed. Observations\nof the model with various past, current, and future instruments were simulated.\nThe results are shown in Figure 5. The solid line is the total emission, while\nthe circles show the emission into the beam of the instrument. The horizontal\nbars show the limits for 1 sec of integration. It is not surprising that IRAS did\nnot detect these objects; SIRTF could detect them at 160 \u03bcm, but that channel\nwill be saturated for most regions of molecular gas just from the extended cloud\nemission. The best regime in which to search for such objects is the millimeter\nto submillimeter, and systems with fairly large beams and fields of view are ideal\nfor the large-scale blind surveys that will be needed. A good example of such\nan instrument is Bolocam, operating on the CSO (Glenn et al. 1998).\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nThe formation of massive stars occurs in parts of molecular clouds that are much\ndenser and more turbulent than the bulk of the molecular gas. Compared to\nthe regions forming low mass stars, the birthplaces of massive stars have high\ndensities over much larger regions and their linewidths are much greater than\nthose inferred from the linewidth-size relation. A clear evolutionary sequence is\ndifficult to establish, but regions surrounding water masers should be younger\nthan those around ultra-compact HII regions. Studies based on H2 O masers\nfind a distribution of masses of dense (n \u223c 106 ) gas that extends to quite large\nmasses. While affected by selection biases, a mean value of 2000\u20134000 M\u2299 is\nfound, enough to form large clusters of stars. Modeling the radial profiles of\nsubmillimeter emission from dust indicates that power laws in density (n(r) \u223c\n\n\f12\n\nEvans et al.\n\n3\n\n2\n\nd = 5.5 kpc, p = 1.7\n\n1\n\n0\nIRAS\n\nSHARCII SCUBA\n\n-1\nBolocam\n\n-2\nSIRTF\n-3\n\nFlux into beam\nNEFD\n\n-4\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\nFigure 5.\nThe SED of a putative Pre-Proto-cluster Core, based on\ntypical properties of the cores found around water masers, but assuming\na constant dust temperature of 10 K.
