Taking the bipartite states as an example, the procedure of distinguishing\nquantum states locally is: Alice and Bob hold a part of a quantum system, which occupies\none of m possible orthogonal states |\u03a81 i , |\u03a82 i , ..., |\u03a8i i , ..., |\u03a8m i. Alice and Bob know the\nprecise form of these states, but don't know which of these possible states they actually\nhold. To distinguish these possible states they will perform some operations locally: Alice\n(or Bob) first measures her part. Then she tells the Bob her measurement result, according\nto which Bob measures his part. With the measurement results they can exclude some\npossibilities of the system [1].\nMany authors have considered some schemes for distinguishing locally between a set of\nquantum states [1\u20138], both inseparable and separable. Bennett et al showed that there are\nnine orthogonal product states in a 3 \u2297 3 system which cannot be distinguished by LOCC\n[2]. Walgate et al showed that any two multipartite orthogonal states can be distinguished\nby LOCC [1]. For two-qubit systems (or 2 \u2297 2 systems), any three of the four Bell states\ncannot be distinguished by LOCC [4]. The distinguishability of quantum states has some\nclose connections with distillable entanglement [9] and the information transformation\n[10]. On one hand, using the upper bound of distillable entanglement, relative entropy\nentanglement [11] and logarithmic negativity [12], the authors in Ref [4] proved that some\nstates are indistinguishable. On the other hand, using the rules on distinguishability one\nmay discuss the distillable entanglement [13]. The LOCC distinguishability has link to\nthe features of non-locality, obviously. So the further analysis for distinguishability is\nmeaningful.\nThe orthogonality acts as an important role in the distinguishability of a set of possible\nstates. A simple necessary condition for distinguishability is each of the possible states\nis orthogonal to the other states. If the states are locally orthogonal states [7], they can\nbe distinguished without classical communication (CC); if the states can be distinguished\nby only projective measurements and CC, each possible state is a superpositions of some\northogonal product vectors [1,3]. A question is: for a set of general LOCC distinguishable\nstates, what is its orthogonality? In this Letter, we will first show that if a set of arbitrary\northogonal states are distinguishable by LOCC, each of the possible states has at least\na product-vectors-decomposition such that the product vectors of each of the possible\nstates are orthogonal to the other possible states. With this result we then prove a simple\nnecessary condition for LOCC distinguishability of a class of orthogonal states. These\nconclusions may be useful in discussing the distinguishability of orthogonal quantum states\nfurther, understanding the essence of nonlocality [14] and discussing the distillation of\nentanglement.\n\n\fWe first take the bipartite states as an example for simplicity.. Consider m possible orthogonal states shared between Alice and Bob. Any protocol to distinguish the m\npossible orthogonal states can be conceived as successive rounds of measurements and\ncommunication by Alice and Bob. Let us suppose Alice is the first person to perform\na measurement (Alice goes first [3]), and the first round measurement by Alice can be\n\b\nrepresented by operators A1j , where A+\n1j A1j is known as a POVM element realized by\nP +\nAlice [15,16], and j A1j A1j = I. If the outcome 1j occurs, then the given |\u03a8i becomes\nA1j |\u03a8i , up to normalization. After communicating the result of Alice's measurement to\nBob, he carries out a measurement and obtain outcome 1k . The given possible state |\u03a8i\nbecomes A1j \u2297 B1k (1j ) |\u03a8i, where B1k (1j ) is an arbitrary measurement operator of Bob\nwhich depend on the outcome 1j of Alice's measurement. After N rounds of measurements and communication, there are many possible outcomes which correspond to many\nmeasurement operators acting on the Alice and Bob's Hilbert space. Each of these operators is a product of the N sequential and relative operators, ANj (1j , 1k , ..., (N \u2212 1)k ) \u2297\nBNk (1j , 1k , ..., (N \u2212 1)k , Nj )...A2j (1j , 1k ) \u2297 B2k (1j , 1k , 2j )A1j \u2297 B1k (1j ), carried out by Alice\nand Bob. We denote these operators as {Ai \u2297 Bi } , where, Ai \u2297 Bi denotes one of these\noperators, which represent the effects of the N measurements and communication. If the\noutcome i occurs, the given |\u03a8i becomes:\nAi \u2297 Bi |\u03a8i\n\n(1)\n\nThe probability pi Alice and Bob gain outcome i is\n+\npi = h\u03a8| A+\ni \u2297 Bi Ai \u2297 Bi |\u03a8i ,\n\n(2)\n\nand\nX\ni\n\n+\nA+\ni \u2297 Bi Ai \u2297 Bi = I.\n\n(3)\n\nSuppose we define:\n+\nEi = A+\ni \u2297 Bi Ai \u2297 Bi ,\n\n(4)\n\nP\nthen Ei is a positive operator and that i Ei = I. Ei is same as the known POVM element.\nIn fact, Ai can be written in the form [15]\nAi = UA2 fAi UA1 ,\n\n(5)\n\nor\nAi = ci1 \u03c6\u2032i1\n\n\u03c6i1 + * * * + cimia \u03c6\u2032imia\n\n0 \u2264 cij \u2264 1, j = 1, * * * , mia .\n2\n\nED\n\n\u03c6imia ;\n\n(6)\n\n\fWhere fAi is a diagonal positive operator and a filtration [15] which changes the\nrelative\nweightsEo\nof components\n|\u03c6i1 i , *Eo\n* * , \u03c6ini ; UA2 , UA1 are two unitary operators;\nn\nn\n\n|\u03c6\u2032i1 i , * * * , \u03c6\u2032imia\nsimilarly for Bi .\n\n|\u03c6i1 i , * * * , \u03c6imia\n\nand\n\nBi =\n\ndi1\n\n\u03b71i\n\n\u03b71\u2032i\n\nare two set of orthogonal Alice's vectors, and\n\n+***+\n\ndimi\nb\n\n\u2032i\n\u03b7m\ni\nb\n\nED\n\ni\n\u03b7m\ni\n\n(7)\n\nb\n\n0 \u2264 dij \u2264 1, j = 1, * * * , mib .\nEo\nE\nn\ni\n\u2032i\nare two set of orthogonal Bob's vectors.\n} and |\u03b71i i , * * * , \u03b7m\nwhere {|\u03b71\u2032i i , * * * , \u03b7m\ni\ni\nb\nb\nFrom Eq.(4), Eq.(6) and Eq.(7), we can represent Ei in the form\nE D\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\n(8)\n\u03c6imia ) \u2297\nEi = (a1 \u03c61 A \u03c61 + * * * + amia \u03c6mia\nE A\nD\ni\ni\n\u03b7m\n(bi1 \u03b71i B \u03b71i + * * * + bimi \u03b7m\ni )\ni\nb\n\n06\n\naimia\n\n6 1, 0 6\n\nbimi\nb\n\n6 1; 1 6\n\nb\n\nmia\n\nb\n\nB\n\n6 Na , 1 6 mib 6 Nb\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Na , Nb is the dimensions of Alice's and Bob's Hilbert space, respectively.\nThe discussion above means that: whatever Alice and Bob choose to do by LOCC, their\nfinal actions will be described by a set of positive operators {Ei } . This result is useful to\nthe following discussions.\nTheorem 1. If a set of m orthogonal states {|\u03a8i i} is perfectly distinguishable by LOCC,\nthere is surely a set of product vectors (PV) such that each state |\u03a8i i is a superposition of\nsome of these product vectors as follows:\nE\nE\ni\nmi\n\u03be\n|\u03a8i i = \u03a61i A \u03bei1 B + * * * + \u03a6m\n;\n(10)\ni\ni\nA\n\nand each product vector \u03a6ki\nD\n\ni\n\nE\n\n\u03a6ki\n\n\u03bek\n\nE\n\nB\n\nA\n\ni\n\ni\n\n(1 6 k i 6 mi ) belongs to only a state |\u03a8i i , i.e.,\n\nD i\n\u03beik \u03a8j i = 0, for all i 6= j;\nD\n\n\u03a6ki\n\ni\n\nB\n\nD\n\ni\n\n\u03beik \u03a8i i =\n6 0,\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nwhere mi is a positive integral number.\nProof: If a set of states is reliably distinguishable by LOCC, there must be a complete\nset of POVM element {Ei } representing the effect of all measurements and communication,\nsuch that if every outcome i occurs Alice and Bob know with certainty that they were given\nthe state |\u03a8i i. This means that:\nh\u03a8i | Ei(s) |\u03a8i i =\n6 0;\n3\n\n(13)\n\n\fh\u03a8j | Ei(s) |\u03a8j i = 0, j 6= i.\n\n(14)\n\nIn a simple way, we can say that a element Ei can \"indicate\" |\u03a8i i and only |\u03a8i i . Of course\na possible state may be \"indicated\" by more than one POVM element Ei . Ei(s) denotes\nall Ei \"indicating\" |\u03a8i i. Note that because the non-projective measures and the classical\ncommunication between Alice and Bob are allowed, some POVM elements in {Ei } can be\nnot orthogonal to others.\nFrom the general expression of a operator Ai in Eq.(6), it follows that a operator Ai\nin a POVM element Ei in Eq.(4) can be carried out by the following operators: 1). do\nprojective operation PAi ,\nPAi = \u03c6i1\n\n\u03c6i1 + * * * + \u03c6ini\n\n\u03c6ini ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhich projects out the Alice's component |\u03c6i1 i , * * * , \u03c6ini in a possible state |\u03a8i i (if\n|\u03a8i=|0iA |0iB +|1iA |1iB ,we say |\u03a8i have components |0iA |0iB and |1iA |1iB ; |\u03a8i have Alice's components |0iA and |1iA ); 2). do local filter operation [17] which changes the relative\nweights of the component |\u03c6i1 i , * * * , \u03c6ini in a possible state |\u03a8i i; 3). do a local unitary\n\b\n\b\nto |\u03c6\u2032i1 i , * * * , \u03c6\u2032ini ,\noperation which transfers the Alice's bases from |\u03c6i1 i , * * * , \u03c6ini\nand similarly for Bi . So if Ei \"indicates\" a state |\u03a8i i , i.e., Eq. (13) holds, the state |\u03a8i i\nshould have all or part of the following components:\nE\nE\nE\nE\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\n\u03b7mi\n.\n(16)\n\u03b71 B , * * * , \u03c6mia\n, * * * , \u03c6mia\n\u03c61 A \u03b71 B , * * * , \u03c61 A \u03b7mi\nb\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nb\n\nB\n\nIf Ei \"indicates\" only the state |\u03a8i i , i.e., Eq. (14) holds, each product vector in (16) should\nbe orthogonal to the other states |\u03a8j i , for all j 6= i. We may say that Ei also \"indicates\"\neach product vector in (16) which belongs to only the state |\u03a8i i .\nBecause of the completeness of {Ei }, which assures that each product vector in all\npossible states can be indicated by a POVM element, and the necessity of reliably distinguishing the possible states, which asks a POVM element \"indicates\" the product vectors\nof only a possible state, each state of the m possible states must be a superposition of\nmany product vectors each of which is orthogonal to the other possible states. This ends\nthe proof.\nThe above theorem 1 shows that if a set of possible states are LOCC distinguishable,\nnot only that these possible states should be orthogonal, but also each possible state\ncan be written as a linear combination of product vectors such that each product vector\nof a possible state |\u03a8i i should be orthogonal to the other possible states. There are\ntwo \"opposite\" cases [3,5]: 1. entanglement may increase the local indistinguishability\nof orthogonal states. An example is: nm orthogonal states of a n \u2297 m system cannot\nbe perfectly LOCC distinguishable if at least one of the states is entangled (see [5]); 2.\n4\n\n\fentanglement may increase the local distinguishability of orthogonal states. An example\nis: the set S containing states (without normalization):\n|\u03a81 i = |00i + w |11i + w 2 |22i ; |\u03a82 i = |00i + w 2 |11i + w |22i ;\n\n(17)\n\n|\u03a83 i = |01i + |12i + |20i ,\n\nis LOCC distinguishable (w is a unreal cube root of unity). But the states, |\u03a81 i , |\u03a82 i and\n|\u03a8\u20323 i = |01i are not LOCC distinguishable (see [5]). In fact, entanglement as a potential\nnon-local \"resource\" may increase the distinguishability of the states (to distinguish a set\nof states, the entanglement of these states may be lost, in general. This means entanglement can be used to distinguish states as to do teleportation et al). But on other hand,\na entangled state contains more product vectors. So the entangled state increases the requirement for orthogonality as shown in the above theorem 1 and then may increase the\nindistinguishability of the states.\nEmploying theorem 1 we can discuss the LOCC distinguishability of orthogonal states\nfurther. First, the above discussions and theorem 1 are fit to the multipartite systems\nobviously. The generalisation of the theorem 1 can be expressed as:\nif a set of multi-partite possible states are LOCC distinguishable, each possible state\ncan be written as a linear combination of product vectors such that each product vector of\na possible state is orthogonal to the other possible states.\nThen we will follow a especially simple criterion for distinguishability of a class of\northogonal states. To achieve this, we define a concept of Schmidt number. If a pure state\n|\u03a8i have following Schmidt decomposition:\n|\u03a8i =\n\nl\nX\n\u221a\ni=1\n\npi |\u03c6i iA |\u03b7i iB ,\n\npi > 0,\n\nl\nX\n\npi = 1\n\n(18)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere |\u03c6i iA s and |\u03b7i iB s are orthogonal bases of Alice and Bob, respectively, we say |\u03a8i\nhas Schmidt number l.\n\b\nTheorem 2: Let \u03a8AB\nis mn \u2212 m\u2032 orthogonal states of an m \u2297 n system, if at least\ni\none of the states has Schmidt numbers bigger than m\u2032 + 1, the states \u03a8AB\ns are not\ni\nperfectly distinguishable by LOCC.\n\b\nProof : Each state of the \u03a8AB\nshould include linearly independent product veci\n)\ntors(LIPV) not less than its Schmidt numbers. If at least one state (note it as \u03a8AB\ni\u2032\nAB\n\u2032\ns has Schmidt numbers bigger than m + 1, an assumption of local disamong the \u03a8i\nis a superposition of more than\ntinguishability of \u03a8AB\ns implies that the state \u03a8AB\ni\ni\u2032\n\u2032\ns(i 6= i\u2032 ). Thus the\nm + 1 LIPVs each of which is orthogonal to the other states \u03a8AB\ni\nform a set of linearly independent vectors\nstates \u03a8AB\ns(i 6= i\u2032 ) and the LIPVs of \u03a8AB\ni\ni\u2032\nof an m \u2297 n system. The number of these linearly independent vectors is bigger than\n5\n\n\fmn \u2212 m\u2032 \u2212 1 + m\u2032 + 1 = mn. This is impossible for an m \u2297 n system. So the states \u03a8AB\ns\ni\nare not perfectly distinguishable by LOCC. This ends the proof.\nSince we cannot define the Schmidt numbers of a multi-partite pure state, in general,\nthe theorem 2 above cannot be generalized to multi-partite states directly. However, any\npure state has a product-vectors-decomposition with the least number of product vectors, if\nwe replace \"Schmidt numbers\" in the theorem 2 by \"the least numbers of product vectors\",\nthe theorem 2 can be generalized into multi-partite states. For example, an 3-qubits system\nowns 7 possible orthogonal states. If one of the possible states is a |W i state\n1\n|W i = \u221a (|100i + |010i + |011i),\n3\n\n(19)\n\nthese possible are not perfectly distinguishable by LOCC since a |W i state has at least\nthree LIPVs [18].\nThe theorem 2 is powerful to check LOCC indistinguishability of the orthogonal states\nthe number of which is equal to or near to the dimensions of the quantum system. For\nexample, one can get by theorem 2 easily that if a full orthogonal basis can be LOCC\ndistinguished all vectors must be product, as shown in Ref. [5].\nTo conclude, we have considered deeply the relation between the orthogonality and\nthe distinguishability, and shown that if a set of possible multi-partite orthogonal states\nare LOCC distinguishable, each of the possible states has at least a product-vectorsdecomposition such that the product vectors of each of the possible states are orthogonal\nto the other possible states. Based on our result one can discuss the distinguishability of\northogonal states further. We also present a simple necessary condition for distinguishability of a class of orthogonal quantum states. These results come directly from the limits on\nlocal operations, not from the upper bound of distillable entanglement [4], So we believe\nthat they may be useful in understanding the essence of nonlocality. On the other hand,\nthe distillation of entanglement and local distinguishability are closely related as shown in\nRef. [4,5,13], so our results may be helpful for calculating the distillable entanglement or\nthe bound of distillable entanglement. The further works may be the applications of these\nresults.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank J. Finkelstein, A. Sen(De) and U.
