The Lucas sequence {Un (P, Q)} is\ndefined by U0 = 0, U1 = 1, Un = P Un\u22121 \u2212 QUn\u22122 (n \u2265 2). The\nquestion of when Un (P, Q) can be a perfect square has generated interest\nin the literature. We show that for n = 2, ..., 7, Un is a square for infinitely\nmany pairs (P, Q) with gcd(P, Q) = 1; further, for n = 8, ..., 12, the only\nnon-degenerate sequences where gcd(P, Q) = 1 and Un (P, Q) = \u2737, are\ngiven by U8 (1, \u22124) = 212 , U8 (4, \u221217) = 6202 , and U12 (1, \u22121) = 122 .\n\nKeywords: Lucas sequence, squares, genus two curves\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet P and Q be non-zero integers. The Lucas sequence {Un (P, Q)} is defined by\nU0 = 0,\n\nU1 = 1,\n\nUn = P Un\u22121 \u2212 QUn\u22122\n\n(n \u2265 2).\n\n(1)\n\nThe sequence {Un (1, \u22121)} is the familiar Fibonacci sequence, and it was proved\nby Cohn [6] in 1964 that the only perfect square greater than 1 in this sequence\nis U12 = 144. The question arises, for which parameters P , Q, can Un (P, Q) be\na perfect square? In what follows, we shall assume that we are not dealing with\nthe degenerate sequences corresponding to (P, Q) = (\u00b11, 1), where Un is periodic with period 3, and we also assume (P, Q) 6= (\u22122, 1) (in which case Un = \u2737\nprecisely when n is an odd square) and (P, Q) 6= (2, 1) (when Un = \u2737 precisely\nwhen n is square). Ribenboim and McDaniel [10] with only elementary methods\nshow that when P and Q are odd, and P 2 \u2212 4Q > 0, then Un can be square only\nfor n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 or 12; and that there are at most two indices greater than 1\n\u2217\n\nDepartment of Mathematics, Arizona State University, Tempe AZ, USA, e-mail: bremner@asu.edu, http:// \u0303andrew/bremner.html\n\u2020\nDepartment of Mathematics, University of Crete, Iraklion, Greece, e-mail:\ntzanakis@math.uoc.gr , http://www.math.uoc.gr/ \u0303tzanakis\n\n1\n\n\ffor which Un can be square. They characterize fully the instances when Un = \u2737,\nfor n = 2, 3, 6. Bremner & Tzanakis [1] extend these results by determining all\nLucas sequences {Un (P, Q)} with U12 = \u2737, subject only to the restriction that\ngcd(P, Q) = 1 (it turns out that the Fibonacci sequence provides the only example). Under the same hypothesis, all Lucas sequences with {Un (P, Q)} with\nU9 = \u2737 are determined. There seems little mention in the literature of when\nunder general hypotheses Un (P, Q) can be a perfect square. It is straightforward\nto see from Theorem 1 of Darmon and Granville [7] that for n sufficiently large\n(n \u2265 11 certainly suffices), the equation Un (P, Q) = \u2737 can have only finitely many\nsolutions for coprime P, Q. Note that for n \u2265 1, Un (kP, k 2 Q) = k n\u22121 Un (P, Q),\nand so for fixed P , Q, and even n, appropriate choice of k gives a sequence\nwith Un (kP, k 2 Q) a perfect square. The restriction to gcd(P, Q) = 1 is therefore a sensible one, and we shall assume this from now on. Rather curiously, a\nsmall computer search reveals sequences with Un (P, Q) a perfect square only for\nn = 0, . . . , 8, and n = 12. In this paper, we shall dispose of this range of n.\nBremner & Tzanakis [1] have addressed the cases n = 9, 12. Section 2 of this\npaper addresses the case Un (P, Q) = \u2737, n \u2264 7, which can be treated entirely\nelementarily. Section 3 addresses the cases Un (P, Q) = \u2737, 8 \u2264 n \u2264 11. In these\ninstances, we deduce a finite collection of curves, whose rational points cover all\nrequired solutions. In turn, this reduces to a number of problems of similar type,\nnamely, finding all points on an elliptic curve defined over a number field K subject to a \"Q-rationality\" condition on the X-coordinate. Nils Bruin has powerful\ntechniques for addressing this type of problem, and [2], [3], [4], [5] provide details and examples. See in particular \u00a74 of [5] for development of the underlying\nmathematics. The latest release of Magma [9] now contains Bruin's routines and\nso we only set up the appropriate computation here, with details of the Magma\nprograms available on request.\nThe results of Sections 2, 3, when combined with the results of Bremner &\nTzanakis [1] give the following theorem:\nTheorem 1. Let P, Q be non-zero coprime integers such that if Q = 1 then\nP 6= \u00b11, \u00b12 (that is, P, Q determine a non-degenerate Lucas sequence). Then (i)\nfor n = 2, ..., 7, Un (P, Q) is a square for infinitely many such pairs (P, Q), and (ii)\nfor n = 8, ..., 12, the only solutions of Un (P, Q) = \u2737 are given by U8 (1, \u22124) = 212 ,\nU8 (4, \u221217) = 6202 , and U12 (1, \u22121) = 122 .\n\n2\n\nSolution of Un (P, Q) = \u2737, n \u2264 7\n\nCertainly U2 (P, Q) = \u2737 if and only if P = a2 , and U3 (P, Q) = \u2737 if and only if\nP 2 \u2212 Q = a2 .\nNow U4 (P, Q) = \u2737 if and only if P (P 2 \u2212 2Q) = \u2737, so if and only if either\nP = \u03b4a2 , Q = 21 (a4 \u2212 \u03b4b2 ), or P = 2\u03b4a2 , Q = 2a4 \u2212 \u03b4b2 , with \u03b4 = \u00b11 (where, in\n2\n\n\fthe first instance, ab is odd and in the second instance b is odd).\nThe demand that U5 (P, Q) be square is that P 4 \u2212 3P 2 Q + Q2 = \u2737, equivalently, that 1 \u2212 3x + x2 = \u2737, where x = Q/P 2 . Parametrizing the quadric,\nQ/P 2 = (5\u03bb2 + 6\u03bb\u03bc + \u03bc2 )/(4\u03bb\u03bc), where, without loss of generality, (\u03bb, \u03bc) = 1,\n\u03bb > 0, and \u03bc 6\u2261 0 (mod 5). Necessarily (\u03bb, \u03bc) = (a2 , \u00b1b2 ), giving (P, Q) =\n(2ab, 5a4 + 6a2 b2 + b4 ) or (2ab, \u22125a4 + 6a2 b2 \u2212 b4 ) if a and b are of opposite parity,\nand (P, Q) = (ab, 41 (5a4 + 6a2 b2 + b4 )) or (ab, 14 (\u22125a4 + 6a2 b2 \u2212 b4 )), if a and b are\nboth odd.\nThe demand that U6 (P, Q) be square is that P (P 2 \u2212 Q)(P 2 \u2212 3Q) = \u2737, which\nleads to one of seven cases: P = a2 , P 2 \u2212 Q = b2 , with \u22122a4 + 3b2 = \u2737; P = a2 ,\nP 2 \u2212 Q = \u22122b2 , with a4 + 3b2 = \u2737; P = \u2212a2 , P 2 \u2212 Q = 2b2 , with a4 \u2212 3b2 = \u2737;\nand P = 3a2 , P 2 \u2212 Q = \u03b4b2 , (\u03b4 = \u00b11, \u00b12), with \u2212 6\u03b4 a4 + b2 = \u2737. So finitely many\nparametrizations result (which can easily be obtained if we wish to do so).\nThe demand that U7 (P, Q) be square is that P 6 \u2212 5P 4 Q + 6P 2Q2 \u2212 Q3 = \u2737,\nequivalently, that 1 + 5x + 6x2 + x3 = y 2 , where x = \u2212Q/P 2 . This latter elliptic\ncurve has rank 1, with generator P0 = (\u22121, 1), and trivial torsion. Accordingly,\nsequences with U7 (P, Q) = \u2737 are parametrized by the multiples of P0 on the\nabove elliptic curve, corresponding to (\u00b1P, Q) = (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, \u22121), (5, 21),\n(1, \u2212104), (21, 545), (52, 415),...\n\n3\n\nSolution of Un (P, Q) = \u2737, n = 8, 10, 11\n\nHere we shall show the following result:\nTheorem. The only non-degenerate sequences where gcd(P, Q) = 1 and Un (P, Q) =\n\u2737, 8 \u2264 n \u2264 11, are given by U8 (1, \u22124) = 212 and U8 (4, \u221217) = 6202.\nFor each n \u2208 {8, 10, 11} we reduce the solution of our problem to a number of\nquestions, all having the following general shape:\nProblem 1. Let\nE : Y 2 + a1 XY + a3 Y = X 3 + a2 X 2 + a4 X + a6\n\n(2)\n\nbe an elliptic curve defined over Q(\u03b1), where \u03b1 is a root of a polynomial f (X) \u2208\nZ[X], irreducible over Q, of degree d \u2265 2, and let \u03b2, \u03b3 \u2208 Q(\u03b1) be algebraic\nintegers. Find all points (X, Y ) \u2208 E(Q(\u03b1)) for which \u03b2X +\u03b3 is a rational number.\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, problems of this type may be attacked with\nthe Magma routines of Nils Bruin, in particular the routine \"Chabauty\" using\noutput from \"PseudoMordellWeilGroup\". It is not a priori guaranteed that these\nroutines will be successful, particularly over number fields of high degree, but for\nour purposes and the computations encountered in this paper, no difficulties arose.\n3\n\n\f3.1\n\nn=8\n\nThe demand that U8 (P, Q) be square is that P (P 2 \u2212 2Q)(P 4 \u2212 4P 2 Q + 2Q2) = \u2737.\nIn the case P is odd, it follows that (P, P 2 \u2212 2Q, P 4 \u2212 4P 2 Q + 2Q2 ) = (a2 , b2 , c2 ),\n(a2 , \u2212b2 , \u2212c2 ), (\u2212a2 , b2 , \u2212c2 ), or (\u2212a2 , \u2212b2 , c2 ), where a, b, c are positive integers\nwith ab odd. The latter two possibilities are impossible modulo 4, and the first\ntwo possibilities lead respectively to:\n\u2212a8 + 2a4 b2 + b4 = 2c2\n\u2212a8 \u2212 2a4 b2 + b4 = \u22122c2 .\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nWe shall see that the only positive solutions to the above equations are (a, b) =\n(1, 1), (1, 3) and (1, 1) respectively, leading to (P, Q) = (1, 0), (1, \u22124) and (1, 1),\nfrom which we reject the first one. The last gives a degenerate sequence. In the\ncase that P is even, then Q is odd, and 2 exactly divides both P 4 \u2212 4P 2 Q + 2Q2\nand P 2 \u2212 2Q, forcing P \u2261 0 (mod 4). Put P = 4p, so that U8 = \u2737 if and\nonly if p(8p2 \u2212 Q)(128p4 \u2212 32p2 Q + Q2 ) = \u2737, with gcd(p, Q) = 1. It follows\nthat (p, 8p2 \u2212 Q, 128p4 \u2212 32p2 Q + Q2 ) = (a2 , b2 , c2 ), (a2 , \u2212b2 , \u2212c2 ), (\u2212a2 , b2 , \u2212c2 ),\nor (\u2212a2 , \u2212b2 , c2 ), where a, b, c are positive integers, (a, b) = 1 and bc is odd.\nThe middle two possibilities are impossible modulo 4, and the remaining two\npossibilities lead respectively to:\n\u221264a8 + 16a4 b2 + b4 = c2\n\u221264a8 \u2212 16a4 b2 + b4 = c2 .\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nWe shall see that the only positive solution which leads to a desired pair (P, Q)\nis from the first equation when (a, b) = (1, 5), leading to (P, Q) = (4, \u221217).\nWe shall work in the number field K = Q(\u03c6) where \u03c6 is a root of f\u03c6 (x) =\nx4 + 2x2 \u2212 1. The class number of K is 1, the maximal order O of K is Z[\u03c6], and\nfundamental units of O are \u03b71 = \u03c6, \u03b72 = 2 \u2212 3\u03c6 + \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c63 . The factorization of 2\nis 2 = \u03b71\u22124 \u03b722 (1 + \u03c6)4 .\n3.1.1\n\nEquation (3)\n\nThe factorization of (3) over K is\n(b \u2212 \u03c6a2 )(b + \u03c6a2 )(b2 + (2 + \u03c62 )a4 ) = 2\u2737,\nand it is easy to see that each of the first two factors is exactly divisible by 1 + \u03c6\nand the third factor is exactly divisible by (1 + \u03c6)2 . Thus the gcd of any two\n(ideal) terms on the left hand side is equal to (1 + \u03c6), and\nb + \u03c6a2 = \u00b1\u03b71i1 \u03b72i2 (1 + \u03c6)\u2737,\n\nb2 + (2 + \u03c62 )a4 = \u00b1\u03b71j1 \u03b72j2 (1 + \u03c6)2 \u2737,\n4\n\n(7)\n\n\fwhere the exponents of the units are 0,1. Specializing \u03c6 at the real root 0.643594...\nof f\u03c6 (x), and using b > 0, then necessarily the sign on the right hand side must\nbe positive. Taking norms in the first equation gives 2c2 = (\u22121)i1 2\u2737, so that\ni1 = 0. Applying the automorphism of K defined by \u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c6, it follows that\nb \u2212 \u03c6a2 = \u03b72\u2212i2 (1 \u2212 \u03c6)\u2737 = \u03b72\u2212i2 +1 (1 + \u03c6)\u2737. Multiplying this equation by the two\ndisplayed equations at (7) gives \u03b71j1 \u03b72j2 +1 \u2737 = 2c2 = \u2737, so that j1 = 0, j2 = 1. We\nnow have\n(b + \u03c6a2 )(b2 + (2 + \u03c62 )a4 ) = \u03b72j (1 + \u03c6)\u2737,\nwith j = 0, 1. Putting b/a2 = \u03b4 \u22121 x/(1 + \u03c6), where \u03b4 \u2208 {1, \u03b72 }, our problem\nreduces to finding all K-points (x, y) on the curves\n(x + \u03c6(1 + \u03c6)\u03b4)(x2 + (2 + \u03c62 )(1 + \u03c6)2 \u03b4 2 ) = y 2 ,\nsubject to \u03b4 \u22121 x/(1 + \u03c6) \u2208 Q. For both curves, the Magma routines of Bruin show\nthat solutions to (3) occur only for (\u00b1a, \u00b1b) = (1, 1), (1, 3).\n3.1.2\n\nEquation (4)\n\nAs above, (4) leads to equations\nb + \u03c6\u22121 a2 = \u03b71i1 \u03b72i2 (1 + \u03c6)\u2737,\n\nb2 + (\u22122 + \u03c6\u22122 )a4 = \u03b71j1 \u03b72j2 (1 + \u03c6)2 \u2737,\n\nwith exponents 0, 1. Taking norms in the first equation gives \u22122c2 = (\u22121)i1 2\u2737,\nso that i1 = 1; and specializing \u03c6 at the real root \u22120.643594... of f\u03c6 (x) in the\nsecond equation gives j1 = 0. We thus obtain\n(b + \u03c6\u22121 a2 )(b2 + (\u22122 + \u03c6\u22122 )a4 ) = \u03b71 \u03b72j (1 + \u03c6)\u2737,\nwith j = 0, 1. Putting b/a2 = \u03b4 \u22121 x/(1 + \u03c6), where \u03b4 = \u03b71 \u03b72j , we thus have to find\nall K-points (x, y) on the curves\n(x +\n\n1+\u03c6\n1\n\u03b4)(x2 + (\u22122 + 2 )(1 + \u03c6)2 \u03b4 2 ) = y 2 ,\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\nx\nsuch that \u03b4 \u22121 1+\u03c6\n\u2208 Q, for \u03b4 = \u03b71 , \u03b71 \u03b72 .

For a 6= 0, put b/a2 = \u03b4 \u22121 x, where \u03b4 = \u03b72j , which leads to seeking\nall K-points (x, y) on the curves\n(x + 2(\u03c63 + \u03c6)\u03b4)(x2 + 8(\u03c62 + 2)\u03b4 2 ) = y 2 ,\nsubject to \u03b4 \u22121 x \u2208 Q, with \u03b4 = 1, \u03b72 .

The assumption gcd(P, Q) = 1 implies that P is coprime to the\nsecond factor on the left at (8), and may only have the divisor 5 in common with\nthe third factor. Further, the second and third factors can only have common divisor 2, impossible for gcd(P, Q) = 1.

Most of the possibilities\nfor (d1 , d2 ) are readily eliminated, either by local consideration, or by leading to\nrank 0 elliptic curves; the case (d1 , d2 ) = (\u22121, \u22125) however resists elementary\ntreatment, apparently leading to a curve of genus 3 with Jacobian \u221a\nof rank 4.

On putting x = Q/P 2 , y = M/P 5 , equation\n(18) becomes that of a genus 2 curve\nC : y 2 = \u2212x5 + 15x4 \u2212 35x3 + 28x2 \u2212 9x + 1,\nand Magma computations show that the Jacobian J of C has rank 1, so that\na Chabauty argument can be applied\n\u221a to determine\n\u221a all\u0001 rational points of C. A\ngenerator is found to be { (3 + 5)/2, (11 + 5 5)/2 \u2212 \u221e} (where \u221e is the\nunique point at infinity on C), and Magma tells us that there is at most one\npair of rational points on C, which is accordingly (0, \u00b11) as required. Full details\nof such an argument may be found in Flynn, Poonen, Schaefer [8]. For greater\ntransparency, we outline the method that reduces as in previous cases to finding\npoints on elliptic curves over a number field under a certain rationality condition.\nWe shall be working over a Galois field, and this approach requires only application of the formal group of an elliptic curve, conceptually more straightforward\nthan invoking the formal group of a curve of genus 2. It is easy to see that\nj=5\nY\n((\u03b6 j/2 + \u03b6 \u2212j/2)\u22122 P 2 \u2212 Q),\nM = u11 (P, Q) =\n2\n\n(19)\n\nj=1\n\nand thus U11 (P, Q) splits completely over the real subfield of the cyclotomic field\nQ(\u03b6) = Q(\u03b611 ). Let \u03b8 = \u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 , so that\nf\u03b8 (\u03b8) = \u03b85 + \u03b84 \u2212 4\u03b83 \u2212 3\u03b82 + 3\u03b8 + 1 = 0,\nand work in the number field K = Q(\u03b8), with ring of integers OK = Z[\u03b8], discriminant 114 , and class-number 1. The unit group is of rank 4, and generators\nmay be taken as:\n\u01eb1 = \u2212\u03b8,\n\n\u01eb2 = \u2212\u03b82 + 2,\n\n\u01eb3 = \u2212\u03b84 + 4\u03b82 \u2212 2,\n\n\u01eb4 = \u2212\u03b83 + 3\u03b8,\n\nwith norms all equal +1.

The Galois group of\nQ(\u03b8)/Q is cyclic, generated by the automorphism \u03c3 : \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b82 \u2212 2, which acts\n\u22121 \u22121 \u22121\ncyclically on the \u03b8i , and satisfies \u01eb\u03c3i = \u01ebi+1 for i = 1, 2, 3, \u01eb\u03c34 = \u01eb\u22121\n1 \u01eb2 \u01eb3 \u01eb4 .\nSince U11 (x, 1) \u2261 0 mod 112 has no solution, M 6\u2261 0 mod 11; so each factor\nLj (P, Q) is prime to 11 in OK . Further, for j 6= k, the K/Q norm of \u03b8j \u2212 \u03b8k is\n9\n\n\f\u00b111, and it follows that the factors Lj (P, Q) for j = 1, ..., 5 are coprime in OK .\nAccordingly,\nL1 (P, Q) = (\u03b84 \u2212 \u03b83 \u2212 2\u03b82 + \u03b8 + 1)P 2 \u2212 Q = (\u22121)i0 \u01ebi11 \u01ebi22 \u01ebi33 \u01ebi44 \u2737,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere i0 , i1 , ..., i4 \u2208 {0, 1}. Since the norm of L1 (P, Q) equals M 2 , we must\nhave i0 = 0. Now let \u2217 : Q(\u03b8) \u0592\u2192 R be the embedding that sends \u03b8 to the\nsmallest real root \u22121.9189859... of f\u03b8 (x). It is straightforward to check that\n\u03b81\u2217 > \u03b84\u2217 > \u03b85\u2217 > \u03b83\u2217 > \u03b82\u2217 , whence\nL\u22171 > L\u22174 > L\u22175 > L\u22173 > L\u22172 .\n\n(22)\n\nSince (20) implies that the exact number of the L\u2217j that are negative must be even,\nthen (22) gives L\u22171 > 0. But \u01eb\u22171 > 0, \u01eb\u22172 < 0, \u01eb\u22173 < 0, \u01eb\u22174 > 0, and so necessarily\ni2 + i3 is even.\nBy applying \u03c3 repeatedly to (21) we obtain:\nsgn(L\u22172 ) = (\u22121)i1 +i2 , sgn(L\u22173 ) = (\u22121)i1 , sgn(L\u22174 ) = (\u22121)i4 , sgn(L\u22175 ) = (\u22121)i3 +i4 .\nListing the 8 possibilities for (i1 , i2 , i3 , i4 ), together with the corresponding signs of\nthe Li , the only ones that respect the linear ordering (22) are (0, 0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0, 0),\nand (1, 0, 0, 1). The conclusion is that\nL1 (P, Q) = \u03b81 P 2 \u2212 Q = \u03b7\u2737,\n\n\u03b7 \u2208 {1, \u01eb1 , \u01eb1 \u01eb4 }.\n\nCertainly\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nL1 = \u03b7\u2737, L2 = \u03b7 \u03c3 \u2737, L3 = \u03b7 \u03c3 \u2737, L4 = \u03b7 \u03c3 \u2737, L5 = \u03b7 \u03c3 \u2737,\nand we have various possibilities for producing an elliptic curve cover of our\noriginal equation. When \u03b7 = 1, then\n(\u03b81 P 2 \u2212 Q)(\u03b82 P 2 \u2212 Q)(\u03b83 P 2 \u2212 Q) = \u2737,\nso that x = \u2212Q/P 2 is the x-coordinate of a K-rational point on the elliptic curve\n(x + \u03b81 )(x + \u03b82 )(x + \u03b83 ) = y 2,\nwith x \u2208 Q. Magma computations show that the only such points on this curve\nare at infinity (corresponding to P = 0), and (x, y) = (0, \u01eb3 \u01eb4 ), corresponding to\n(P 2 , Q) = (1, 0).\nWhen \u03b7 = \u01eb1 or \u01eb1 \u01eb4 , then\n(\u03b81 P 2 \u2212 Q)(\u03b82 P 2 \u2212 Q)(\u03b83 P 2 \u2212 Q) = \u03b4\u2737,\nwith \u03b4 = \u01eb1 \u01eb2 \u01eb3 or \u01eb1 , respectively; and x = \u2212\u03b4Q/P 2 is the x-coordinate of a\nK-rational point on the elliptic curve\n(x + \u03b4\u03b81 )(x + \u03b4\u03b82 )(x + \u03b4\u03b83 ) = y 2 ,\n10\n\n\fsatisfying \u03b4 \u22121 x \u2208 Q. These two curves both have positive K-rank, and by the\nMagma routines lead to no non-trivial solutions for P , Q.\nAcknowledgement: We thank the anonymous referee for several useful comments.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
