This is in sharp contrast to D-branes, where a microscopic description in terms\nof open strings has driven a huge amount of progress in string theory and gauge theory.\nThe three-dimensional superconformal field theory which is supposed to describe multiple\ncoincident M2 branes may lead to profound new insight in our understanding of M-theory.\nRecently Bagger and Lambert [1, 2, 3] and Gustavsson [4, 5], proposed a new set of 2 + 1\ndimensional field theory (henceforth called the BLG theory) which is supposed to describe\nlow energy world volume theory of multiple coincident M2 branes. The BLG theory was\nconstructed in frame of so-called 3-algebra, a generalization of the Lie algebra with triple\nbracket replacing the commutator and the 4-index structure constant replacing the usual\n3-index structure constant of the Lie algebra. There are two requirements of 3-algebra\nin the BLG theory: one is called the fundamental identity which is the generalization of\nthe Jacobi identity of the Lie algebra; the other is that the metric of 3-algebra is positive\ndefinite. Recently the BLG theory was generalized to a novel 3-algebra by relaxing the\nassumption that the metric on 3-algebra is positive definite [6][7][8]. Henceforth we will\ncall this theory generalized BLG theory. The generalized BLG theory has many features\nwhich suggest that it is related to M2 branes. For example, the gauge interaction term is\nthe BF-type which do not admit a tunable coupling constant and this property extends to\nthe full generalized BLG theory. The key point is that this construction starts from the\narbitrary Lie algebra, so that we can construct theory of arbitrary number of M2 branes\nwhich makes the well-developed large N tool [9] possible in this field.\nIn this letter we construct the one parameter deformation of the generalized BLG theory\nand then we use the strategy of [10] to show the relation between the deformed M2 branes\ntheory and the induced D2 branes system. The deformed of BLG theory was considered in\n[3] [11] [12] . The rest of this letter is organized as follows. In section 2, we give a brief review\nof the BLG theory and its generalized form. In section 3, we consider the deformation of\nthe generalized BLG theory. In section 4, following Mukhi and Papageorgakis, we consider\nthe reduction of M branes to D branes in the presence background fluxes. In section 5, we\nwill give some discussions. For other recent developments of the BLG theory, see [14]-[25].\nNote added: After this letter was finished, the preprint [13] focusing on Janus field\ntheory appeared on arXiv with substantial overlap with our results.\n\n2\n\nBrief Review of Generalized BLG Theory\n\nThe BLG theory is based on 3-algebra, which is the generalization of Lie algebra. A 3algebra is a N dimensional vector space with basis T A (A = 1, 2, ....N) which is endowed\nwith a trilinear antisymmetric product\n[T A , T B , T C ] = f ABC D T D\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\n\fwhere f ABC D is the structure constant. From (2.1) it is clear that f ABC D = f [ABC] D . Then\nfurther suppose there is a trace form providing a metric\nhAB = Tr(T A , T B )\n\n(2.2)\n\nIn order to serve as the gauge symmetry algebra of M2 branes world volume theory, namely\nthat for the equations of motion to be consistent with gauge symmetry and supersymmetry,\nthe fundamental identity need to be imposed to the 3-algebra:\n[T A , T B , [T C , T D , T E ]]\n\n= [[T A , T B , T C ], T D , T E ] + [T C , [T A , T B , T D ], T E ]\n+[T C , T D , [T A , T B , T E ]]\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhich extends the Jacobi identity to the 3-algebra and is equivalent to\nf EF G D f ABC G = f EF AG f BCG D + f EF B G f CAG D + f EF C G f ABG D\n\n(2.4)\n\nIn order to derive equations of motion from the Lagrangian description, a bi-invariant\nmetric hAB on the 3-algebra is needed which requires\nTr([T A , T B , T C ], T D ) + Tr(T A , [T B , T C , T D ]) = 0\n\n(2.5)\n\nThis implies the tensor f ABCD \u2261 f ABC E hED is totally antisymmetric.\nThe BLG theory enjoys the classical conformal invariance and N = 8 supersymmetry,\nwhich has 16 supersymmetries. The action also has a manifest SO(8) R-symmetry that acts\non the scalars X (I) . It has no free parameters and the structure constant of the 3-algebra\nis quantized [3], which strongly suggests the conformal invariance is exact at the quantum\nlevel. The elegant and unique structure of the BLG theory makes it a very compelling\ncandidate of the multiple M2 branes theory. The BLG theory encodes the interactions of\nthree dimensional N = 8 multiplet. The fermionic field \u03a8 is a Majorana spinor in 10 + 1\ndimensions satisfying the chirality condition \u039301\u03022\u0302 \u03a8 = \u2212\u03a8 while the SUSY parameter \u01eb\nsatisfies \u039301\u03022\u0302 \u01eb = \u01eb. As a result, \u03a8 has 16 real fermionic components equivalent to 8 bosonic\n(I)\ndegrees of freedom. The bosonic fields include 8 real scalar fields XA , (where I = 1, ...8\nspecifying the transverse directions of M2 branes) and a gauge field A\u03bc (where \u03bc = 0, 1\u0302, 2\u0302\ndescribing the longitudinal directions). In 2+1 dimensions, an ordinary gauge field has one\npropagating degree of freedom. However, in the BLG theory the gauge field A has only a\nChern-Simons term rather than canonical kinetic terms and hence it has no propagating\ndegree of freedom. Matter fields in the BLG theory take values in 3-algebra, so that we\n(I)\nhave X (I) = XA T A , \u03a8 = \u03a8A T A . The BLG Lagrangian is given by [2]\nL\n\n1\ni\ni\n(I)\n= \u2212 D\u03bc X A(I) D \u03bc XA + \u03a8\u0304A \u0393\u03bc D\u03bc \u03a8A + fABCD \u03a8\u0304B \u0393IJ X C(I) X D(J) \u03a8A\n2\n2\n4\n1\n\u2212 (fABCD X A(I) X B(J) X C(K) )(fEF G D X E(I) X F (J) X G(K) )\n12\n\u0011\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u0010\n2\n+ \u01eb\nfABCD A\u03bc AB \u2202\u03bd A\u03bb CD + fAEF G fCDGB A\u03bc AB A\u03bd CD A\u03bb EF\n2\n3\n3\n\n(2.6)\n\n\fThe theory is invariant under the N = 8 SUSY transformations:\n\u03b4X A(I) = i\u01ed\u0393I \u03a8A\n\n(2.7)\n\n1\n\u03b4\u03a8A = D\u03bc X A(I) \u0393\u03bc \u0393I \u01eb + X B(I) X C(J) X D(K)f A BCD \u0393IJK \u01eb\n6\nA\nC(I) D A\n\u03b4(\u00c3\u03bc ) B = i\u01ed\u0393\u03bc \u0393I X\n\u03a8 f BCD\n\n(2.8)\n(2.9)\n\nand the gauge transformations:\n\u03b4X A(I) = \u039b\u0303A B X B(I) ,\n\n\u03b4\u03a8A = \u039b\u0303A B \u03a8B ,\n\n\u03b4(\u00c3\u03bc )A B = D\u03bc \u039b\u0303A B .\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere \u039b\u0303A B = \u039bM N f M N A B and (\u00c3\u03bc )A B = (A\u03bc )M N f M N A B . The gauge group is generated\nby the \u039b\u0303A B , while the antisymmetric \u039bM N are auxiliary parameters. The gauge group is\nthus a subgroup of GL(N) where N is the dimension of 3-algebra. If we add a metric of\nsignature (N \u2212 k, k) on the 3-algebra, then we can say that the gauge group is a subgroup\nof SO(N \u2212k, k). The closure of the SUSY transformations implies the equations of motion.\nIn most of physical theories, a positive definite metric is required to preserve unitarity,\nthat is the theory has positive definite kinetic terms preventing the propagation of ghost\ndegrees of freedom. In the BLG theory, the positive definite metric requirement is very\nstrong: it was conjectured in [28] and then proved in [29][30] that there is only one nontrivial 3-algebra A4 satisfying positive definite metric requirement. 3-algebra A4 is 4dimensional and defined by structure constants f ABC D = \u01ebABC D , where \u01ebABCD is the\n4-dimensional Levi Civita symbol. New constructions are possible if we do not require\nthe existence of Lagrangian but only of the equations of motion [31][32], which can be\nwritten without the help of metric in the algebra. Note that in the Bagger-Lambert work\nat the level of equation of motion, the metric is not used. The metric is needed in order to\nhave a Lagrangian and gauge invariant local operators. Recently there is a breakthrough\nin constructing new 3-algebra [6][7][8]. The novel construction of 3-algebra AG is based\non an arbitrary compact and semi-simple Lie algebra G. These new constructions relax\nthe requirement that the metric on the 3-algebra is positive and definite. The direction\nof relaxing positive definite metric requirement has been pursued in some earlier papers\n[33][28]. Following the convention of [6], the metric on the 3-algebra AG is\nhAB = \u03b7 AB ,\n\nA, B = 0, 1, ..., n + 1,\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere N = n + 2 is the dimension of AG and \u03b7 AB =diag(-1,1,....,1) is the Minkowski metric\non 3-algebra AG . Then we split the 3-algebra indices (A, B, .... ) into (0, a, b, ...., \u03c6), where\na, b = 1, ...., n and \u03c6 \u2261 n + 1. The following form of the totally antisymmetric structure\nconstants satisfies the fundamental identity (2.4) :\nf 0abc = f \u03c6abc = f abc ,\n\nf o\u03c6ab = f abcd = 0\n\n(2.12)\n\n3-index structure constants f abc are the structure constants of a compact semi-simple Lie\nalgebra G and satisfy the usual Jacobi identity. It is convenient to change the generators\nto the light-cone form:\nT \u00b1 = \u00b1T 0 + T \u03c6\n(2.13)\n4\n\n\fIn this base, the metric of AG is given by\nh+\u2212 = h\u2212+ = 2 ,\n\nh++ = h\u2212\u2212 = 0 ,\n\nhab = \u03b4 ab ,\n\nh\u00b1a = ha\u00b1 = 0\n\n(2.14)\n\nand the structure constants are\nf +abc = \u2212f a+bc = f ab+c = \u2212f abc+ = 2f abc\nf\u2212abc = \u2212fa\u2212bc = fab\u2212c = \u2212fabc\u2212 = fabc\nf \u2212abc = f+abc = 0\nIt is easy to see that the generator T \u2212 is central, viz. that the trilinear antisymmetric\nproduct vanishes whenever T \u2212 appears. The Lagrangian based on AG is given by\n1\ni\n(I)\n(I)\nL = \u2212 hAB D\u03bc XA D \u03bc XB + hAB \u03a8\u0304A \u0393\u03bc D\u03bc \u03a8B\n2\n2\n1 M N ABC\n(I) (J) (K) (I) (J) (K)\nEF G\n\u2212 h f\nMf\nN XA XB XC XE XF XG\n12\n\u0010\n\u0011\ni\n(I) (J)\n\u2212 hDE f ABC E XA XB \u03a8\u0304C \u0393IJ \u03a8D + 4\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb Tr B\u03bb (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 [A\u03bc , A\u03bd ]) (2.15)\n4\nIt is important to note that the Lagrangian should be derived directly based on the new\nalgebra AG [7] rather than from the result of Bagger and Lambert [2]. Bagger-Lambert\nLagrangian depends on the assumption that the metric is positive and definite. Henceforth\nwe will call this theory generalized Bagger-Lambert theory which is based on 3-algebra AG .\nThe generalized Bagger-Lambert theory does not admit any tunable coupling constant\nwhich hints that the generalized Bagger-Lambert theory is related to M2 branes.\n\n3\n\nDeformation of the Generalized BLG Theory\n\nIn ref.[26], it was argued that in the presence of a particular background four form flux,\nM2 branes preserve four supersymmetries and exhibit an SO(4) R-symmetry. Furthermore,\nthe flux induces a supersymmetric mass term for the world volume scalars and fermions.\nIt was also argued that in this background, the vacuum of n M2 branes is a state in which\nthe scalars describe a fuzzy three-sphere in spacetime. The M2 branes puff up so that\ntheir world volume is of form R1,2 \u00d7 Se3 , where Se3 is a fuzzy three sphere which becomes\na normal S 3 as n \u2192 \u221e. This setup provides an M-theory analog of Myers effect which\noccurs for D-branes in the presence of background fluxes [27]. Following this argument,\nthe fuzzy sphere solution of the BLG theory was found in [3] based on A4 algebra. The\nmore general deformation was considered in [11] in which two terms are added to the BLG\ntheory.

The general solution to this problem is tricky and we\nneed to resort to Janus field theory. The reader who is interested in this approach is referred\nto recent paper [13] and references therein. In this letter, we are not ambitious to deal\nwith the general solution. Instead we will fix the problem in the specific limit, the weak\nbackground flux limit which means that \u03bc2 is very small. In other words X \u2212(8) varies slowly\nalong with worldvolume coordinates. In this limit, Mukhi-Papageorgakis Higgs mechanism\nis easy to deal with. Following the strategy of [10], we make one of the scalar fields acquire\nthe expectation value with the restriction of (3.13) and (3.14). Later we will make X \u2212(8)\nacquire the expectation value so we solve X \u2212(8) only and keep VEV of other fields vanish.\nThe general solution is,\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nX \u2212(8) = Aep\u03bc x + Be\u2212p\u03bc x\n(4.1)\nwhere A and B are integral constants and p\u03bc satisfies p2 = \u03bc2 . For simplicity, we will work\nin the weak background flux limit. We expect from this limit we can get some hints to the\ngeneral solution. In this limit we propose that\n\u221a\n2R\n\u2212(8)\n(4.2)\n<X\n>= 3\nlp2\nwhere R is the radius of a circle on which we compactify M-theory to get type IIA string\n2\ntheory and lp is the 11 dimensional Planck length scale. We have R = gs ls = gs3 lp from\nthe string theory dualities and gY2 M = 2(2\u03c0)p\u22122gs lp\u22123\nfrom Dp brane world volume theory,\ns\nwhere gs , ls are string coupling and string length and gY M is Dp brane world volume theory\ncoupling which is just p+1 dimensional SYM coupling. Combining the above results, we\nfind that < X \u2212(8) >= gY M . Notice that2 gY M must be function of world volume coordinates\nin order to satisfy the constraint equation (3.13). \u2202\u03bc gY M can be neglected compared with\ngY M in the above limit. In order to get the super Yang-Mills theory smoothly from its\n2\n\nI am grateful to Zhao-Long Wang for pointing this.\n\n8\n\n\fstrong coupling limit, membranes worldvolume theory, we need to take the limit gY M \u226b 1.\nFor the novel 3-algebra , the fundamental identity implies that AG reduces to the algebra\nG \u00d7 U(1). It is easy to see from structure constants f Abc d . If A = +, we get the general Lie\nalgebra G. Otherwise structure constants vanish and U(1) is reduced. Notice that a VEV\n< X \u2212(8) > does not preserve all the supersymmetries due to the \u03bc term in (3.7). This\nsuggests that the reduced D2 branes system does not preserve all the supersymmetries\nin the reduced background.

Notice that the modes X \u03c6(8)\nand X 0(8) are free and can be dualised to two U(1) gauge fields by Abelian duality. Thus\n(4.19) of the decoupled Lagrangian tell us that there are two copies of U(1) gauge theory.\nOne U(1) theory is normal, and the other is ghost. The rest part of decoupled Lagrangian\n(4.20) adds some extra terms to the two copies of U(1) theories. The first two terms in\n(4.20) are the mass terms for two U(1) theories respectively. The second term in (4.20)\ncontains two source-like terms for two U(1) theories respectively. The last term in (4.20)\nis a non-propagating term and does not affect the dynamics of the theory. Therefore we\nfind that in the limit we take above, the ghost Lagrangian is completely decoupled from\nthe SU(N)\u00d7U(1) and it does not affect the unitary.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this letter, we start from the multiple M2 branes world volume theory which is based\non a novel 3-algebra without the positive definite metric assumption. Then we deform the\nworld volume theory with background fluxes and the induced mass terms. The deformed\n11\n\n\ftheory is supersymmetric and without tunable coupling constant. These properties are\nexpected for the field theory living on multiple M2 branes. Frankly speaking, the approach\nof this letter is just an approximate approach of the complete solution. The motivation\nof this letter is that the study of M2 branes model may give us some hints about the\nChern-Simons like term of multiple M2 branes in flux background. My colleagues have\ndone some research work on this topic [36]. We expect that the result of our approximate\napproach will give some hints to their research. In [34][35], the theory of coincident M2\nbranes on R \u00d7 T 2 was argued to provide the Matrix theory description of Type IIB string\ntheory, and the correspondence in some limits have been tested [11]. The study of the\ndeformed M2 branes theory may lead new insights in understanding the stringy physics\nin Type IIB Matrix theory. We have shown that when one component of the scalar fields\ndevelops a VEV, the ensuing Higgs mechanism produces a strong coupled SYM on arbitrary\nnumber D2 branes in reduced background. It is interesting to find that after Higgsing, the\nghost part of original M2 branes theory is consistently decoupled. Though there are hints\nsuggesting that the negative norm states can be consistently decoupled from the physical\nHilbert space, the complete analysis remains to be uncovered.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to acknowledge useful conversations with Miao Li, Tower Wang and Zhao-Long\nWang.
