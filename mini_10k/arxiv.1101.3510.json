We use the biggest Galactic O-star blue-violet spectroscopic\nsample ever (GOSSS, see contribution by Ma\u0131\u0301z Apell\u00e1niz). This sample allows a new insight\non this topic because of the adequacy of O-star spectra, the sample number (700 and\nincreasing, 400 used here), and their distribution in the MW disk. We confirm the high\ncorrelation coefficients between different DIBs and E(B \u2212 V ), though the detailed behavior\nof each case shows small differences. We also detect a moderately low correlation coefficient\nbetween Ca ii \u03bb3934 (Ca K) and E(B \u2212 V ) with a peculiar spatial distribution that we\nascribe to the relationship between line saturation and velocity profiles for Ca ii \u03bb3934.\n\n1\n\nData description and processing\n\nWe used \u223c900 spectra corresponding to \u223c400 O stars (plus some B and WR stars) from the\nGOSSS survey (see talk by Jes\u00fas Ma\u0131\u0301z Apell\u00e1niz [6] in this meeting) and reduced using the\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nwww.iaa.es\nwww.stsci.edu\nwww.userena.cl\nwww.lco.cl\nwww.fcaglp.unlp.edu.ar/\u223cgladys/ialp\n\n\f2\n\nScience with GOSSS : The relationship between DIBs, ISM, and extinction.\n\nFigure 1: Sample blue-violet spectra for two GOSSS O stars.

Note the\nhigh EW of the Ca II lines and the moderate EW of the DIBs in HDE 303 308 (in Carina)\nand compare it with the high EW of the DIBs and moderate EW of the Ca II lines in Cyg\nOB2-7 (in Cygnus).\n\n\fMiguel Penad\u00e9s Ordaz et al.\n\n3\n\npipeline developed by one of us (see poster by Alfredo Sota [9] in this meeting). The\nspectra have high S/N (200 or better) and cover the 3900-5100 \u00c5 range with a spectra\nresolution R\u223c2500. To measure the equivalent widths of the bands and lines of our study (Ca\nII \u03bb3934, CH+ \u03bb4232, and DIBs \u03bb\u03bb4501, 4726, 4762, 4780, and 4964 \u00c5) we have used a visual\nIDL package based program written by one of us (Jes\u00fas Ma\u0131\u0301z Apell\u00e1niz). The code allowed\nus to perform a fast and reliable analysis using both numerical integration and gaussian fits\nof each absorption line. Each fit was visually inspected and interactively adjusted to account\nTable 1: Correlation coefficients (top row in each cell) and noise-modified maximum correlation coefficients (bottom row) for the quantities in this work.\n\n4\n\n4\n\nfor contamination by nearby lines, velocity shifts, and S/N effects. Some of the spectra\nwere eliminated because of quality-control issues related to those effects. The color excesses E(B \u2212 V ) were derived from [a] the photometry in the Galactic O-Star Catalog (Ma\u0131\u0301z\nApell\u00e1niz et al. 2004 [5], Sota et al. 2008 [8]), [b] the temperature-spectral type relationships\nin Martins et al. (2005) [7], and [c] the magnitudes as a function of temperature and luminosity class in the latest version of CHORIZOS (Ma\u0131\u0301z Apell\u00e1niz 2004 [4]). All the equivalent\nwidths were correlated with each other and with the color excess Table 1. We performed for\neach pair linear and parabolic fits.

We also show the linear and parabolic fits performed.\nThe better fit by a parabola for the 4762 \u00c5 DIB band behavior is possibly due to the skin\neffect (DIBs originating in the diffuse ISM and in the outer layers of molecular clouds).\ncorrelation coefficient for two perfectly correlated variables affected by random noise (the\nvalue is close to but not exactly 1.0).\n\n2\n\nResults\n\nDIBs are one of the older questions without answer in astronomy. More than 300 bands have\nbeen discovered in nearly a century. The currently favored carriers are carbon-based, but\ntheir specific nature is still highly debated (Herbig 1995 [2], Galazutdinov et al. 2000 [1],\nKa\u017amierczak et al. 2010 [3]). As we knew from previous literature results, DIBs are tightly\ncorrelated with extinction, but also with a considerable dispersion and differences for each\nband. This has been once again verified in this study. Other important corroboration is\nthe variability of the correlation coefficients, indicating that DIBs are likely to originate in a\nfamily of carriers instead of a single one (Table 1).\nIt is believed that DIB carriers are present in diffuse clouds or the surface of dense ones\nas opposed to dense cores. This could be the reason of the better fit by a parabola in Fig.\n2 (right) and is known as the skin effect: at high extinctions the EW of some DIBs depends\n\n\f5\n\n/1\n.44\n\nMiguel Penad\u00e9s Ordaz et al.\n\n1.0\n\n=(\nE(\nB\u00ef\nV)\n\u00ef0\n.5\n\n)/\n\n1.4\n\n4\n\n(B\n\u00efV\n)/\n1\n33\n39\n\n0.5\n\n39\n\nEW\n\nEW 3933 (\u00c5)\n\n0.0\n0.50\n\u00ef0.5\n\n1.44*EW3933 \u00ef E(B\u00efV)\n\n33\n\n0.75\n\nEW\n\nEW\n\n39\n\n33\n\n=E\n\n=(\nE(\n\nB\u00ef\nV)\n+0\n\n.44\n\n.5)\n\n1.00\n\nl from 330 to 30\n\n0.25\n\nl from 30 to 90\nl from 90 to 150\n\n\u00ef1.0\n\nl from 150 to 210\nl from 210 to 270\nl from 270 to 330\n\n0.00\n0.00\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n\n1.00\n1.25\nE(B\u00efV)\n\n1.50\n\n1.75\n\n2.00\n\n2.25\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n200\n250\nGalactic longitude (degrees)\n\n300\n\n350\n\nFigure 3: Behavior of the Ca II \u03bb3934 (K) interstellar absorption as a function of E(B \u2212 V )\nand Galactic longitude for the GOSSS sample. Note the different behavior in the direction\nof, on the one hand, Carina (blue), and on the other hand, Cygnus (red points) and, to some\nextent, Sagittarius (black). The 1.44 value is the slope of the linear fit performed.\non color excess more weakly than at low extinctions. On the other hand, some DIBs do not\nshow the effect in our data (Fig. 2).\nThe relationship of the Ca II \u03bb3934 line with extinction Figs. 3 shows an interesting\nbehavior. For low values of E(B\u2212V ), the EW of the line is approximately proportional to the\nreddening. At intermediate values, however, two branches form, one with large E(B \u2212V ) and\nintermediate EW (3934) and another one with intermediate E(B \u2212 V ) and large EW (3934).\nFurthermore, the two branches are distinguished as regions in the sky, with the first one\nconcentrated in Cygnus (with most stars being Cyg OB2 members) and, to some extent,\nSagittarius, and the second one in Carina. The most plausible explanation is the existence of\ncloud velocity structure (unresolved in our spectra). Ca II \u03bb3934 can saturate in moderately\ndense clouds, so the behavior of its equivalent width depends not only on the amount of\nmaterial present but also on whether it is distributed in one or more clouds of different\nvelocities. Fig. 3 is consistent with Ca II being concentrated in a single cloud in the direction\nof Cygnus and in several in the direction of Carina. Such velocity distribution has been\nextensively studied for the case of the Carina Nebula Asssociation (Walborn et al. 2007 [10]\nand references therein), where multiple velocity components are indeed present and caused\nby the kinetic energy input from the massive stars there. On the other hand, Cygnus OB2 is\n\n\f6\n\nScience with GOSSS : The relationship between DIBs, ISM, and extinction.\n\ncloser to us than the Carina Nebula and has no associated H II region, so the absorbing Ca\nII cloud is likely to be a single and relatively unperturbed foreground object.\n\n3\n\nFuture\n\nOur future plans include:\n1 Increase the sample of observed stars.\n2 Analyze the rest of the DIB lines in the blue-violet spectra.\n3 Obtain spectra in the rest of the visible spectrum to observe more DIBs.\n4 Use high-resolution spectra to study the velocity structure of the Ca II \u03bb3934 line and\nweak DIBs.\n5 Use CHORIZOS to derive E(4405 \u2212 5495) and R5495 , the monochromatic equivalents\nto E(B \u2212 V ) and RV , respectively, and study their correlation with the measured\nequivalent widths.\n\nAcknowledgments\nSupport for this work was provided by [a] the Spanish Government Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00f3n\nthrough grants AYA2007-64052, the Ram\u00f3n y Cajal Fellowship program, and FEDER funds; [b]\nthe Junta de Andaluc\u0131\u0301a grant P08-TIC-4075; and [c] NASA through grants GO-10205, GO-10602,\nand GO-10898 from the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of\nUniversities for Research in Astronomy Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.This research has\nmade extensive use of Aladin (Bonnarel et al., 2000), and of the SIMBAD database, operated at CDS,\nStrasbourg, France.\n\nReferences\n[1] Galazutdinov, G.
