A peak in the imaginary part of the\nelastic susceptibility is found slightly below the Curie temperature, whose temperature and frequency dependences are typical of the dielectric and magnetic susceptibilities of relaxor ferroelectrics,\nspin glasses and other inhomogeneous frustrated systems. The fluctuations can be associated with\nthe magnetic clusters which are observed by several techniques or with charge-ordered insulating\ndomains in the low temperature inhomogeneous phase. The temperature dependent distribution\nfunction of the fluctuation energy barriers has been extracted by the analysis of the experimental\ncurves.\n\n1\n\n\fto the dynamic response of the system,15 and also the\nmagnetic fluctuations can affect the anelastic response\nthrough magnetoelastic coupling.\nThe La1\u2212x Cax MnO3 samples, with x ranging from\n0.33 to 0.5, were prepared from La2 O3 , CaCO3 and\nMnO2 powders and sintered at 1300-1400 o C several\ntimes, until the X-ray diffraction spectra indicated that\nall the starting powders had reacted; the ingots were cut\ninto bars approximately 45 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 0.5 mm3 . The complex dynamic Young's modulus E (\u03c9, T ) = E \u2032 + iE \u2032\u2032 was\nmeasured as a function of temperature by electrostatically exciting the 1st and 5th free flexural modes, whose\nfrequencies \u03c9/2\u03c0 are in the ratios 1 : 13.2 and detecting the vibration amplitude with a frequency modulation technique. The relative change of the real part E \u2032\nwas measured from the temperature dependence of \u03c9 2 =\nE \u2032 /\u03c1, where the mass density \u03c1 varies much less than\nE; the imaginary part is related to the elastic energy\nloss coefficient (or reciprocal of the mechanical Q) by\nQ\u22121 (\u03c9, T ) = E \u2032\u2032 /E \u2032 = \u03c7\u2032\u2032 /\u03c7\u2032 , where the \u03c7 = 1/E is the\nelastic susceptibility (compliance), and it was measured\nfrom the decay of the free oscillations or from the width\nof the resonance peak.\nThe anelastic spectrum of La1\u2212x Cax MnO3 with 0.33 \u2264\nx \u2264 0.5 is dominated by the trigonal/orthorhombic\nstructural transition at Tt and the PI/FM transition\nat TC . Figure 1 presents the whole anelastic spectrum\nof a sample with x = 0.33, with Tt = 721 K and\nTC = 250 K. The sharpness of the structural transition at\nTt = 721 K is an indication of the good sample homogeneity, while the huge stiffening below TC = 250 K demonstrates the strong interplay between orbital/magnetic\nand lattice phenomena, already observed by ultrasonic\nmeasurements.16,17 Similar spectra were obtained with\nCa doping up to 50%.\nIn the present paper we are concerned with the region\nof the spectrum just below the PI/FM transition, which\ndid't present any particular feature in the previous ultrasonic experiments.16,17 This part of the spectrum is\nshown in Fig. 2 for the sample with x = 0.33. In analyzing acoustic data, it is always assumed that the absorption can be identified with the imaginary susceptibility;\nin the present case, however, we have to analyze the spectrum just below TC , where the large and rapid stiffening\nof the modulus has to be taken into account. Therefore, instead of Q\u22121 we plot \u03c7\u2032\u2032 /\u03c70 = Q\u22121 \u03c7\u2032 /\u03c70 , where\n2\n\u03c7\u2032 (\u03c9, T ) = \u03c70 [\u03c9 (0) /\u03c9 (T )] and \u03c70 = \u03c7\u2032 (0, 0) is the\nreciprocal of the static Young's modulus at T = 0. Beside a sharp attenuation peak centred near TC = 250 K,\nalso determined from the onset of the stiffening (Fig. 1)\nand from the peak in the electrical resistivity, a broad\nshoulder appears at lower temperature. Such a peak is\nthe focus of the following discussion, and was observed,\nalthough with different amplitudes, in all our samples\nwith five Ca doping levels included between 0.33 and 0.5;\nwe chose to analyze the two cases in which the background subtraction was easier. First of all the absorp-\n\nThe perovskite manganese oxides R1\u2212x Ax MnO3 (R =\nLa, Pr, or Nd and A = Ca, Ba, Sr, or Pb) are the\nobject of intense study, since the strong coupling between their electronic, magnetic, orbital and structural\ndegrees of freedom gives rise to a rich phase diagram\nas a function of doping and temperature.1 In particular,\nLa1\u2212x Cax MnO3 in the doping range 0.20 < x < 0.50 undergoes a phase transition from paramagnetic insulating\n(PI) to metallic ferromagnetic (FM) upon cooling below room temperature, and exhibit the so called negative colossal magnetoresistance (CMR). The original interpretation of the magneto-conductive phase transition\nby the classical double exchange (DE) mechanism has\nbeen recently demonstrated to be not quantitatively sufficient. Therefore a strong charge-phonon polaronic coupling, associated with the Jahn-Teller distortion of the\nMn3+ (O2\u2212 )6 octahedra, has been supposed2 , which still\ndoes not supply an exhaustive interpretation of CMR. In\nparticular, a strong magnetic correlation between charge\ncarriers and local moments causes the self-trapping of\nthe carriers in magnetic polarons3 over regions of about\n10-20 \u00c5. When a magnetic field is applied, these ferromagnetic clusters overlap leading to carrier delocalization\nand consequently to CMR.3,4 Such spin polarons have\nbeen first revealed in non Jahn-Teller systems presenting\nCMR, like dilute magnetic semiconductors, rare earth\nchalcogenides, Mn pyrochlores, and now also in manganites around the Curie temperature TC by inelastic neutron scattering,5 small angle neutron scattering6 (SANS)\nand NMR.7 These magnetic polarons can be the precursors of the phase inhomogeneities recently evidenced below TC by STM,8 NMR9 and X-ray diffraction studies.10\nIn this phase, insulating and metallic domains of 1050 nm coexist and percolate as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. Such a phase separated\nscenario recalls the relaxor ferroelectrics, which also are\nperovskites, where the mixed composition induces ferroelectric clusters of nanometer dimensions embedded\nin a paraelectric matrix.11,12 Analogously, in manganites with mixed compositions lile La1\u2212x\u2212y Pry Cax MnO3\nand Nd0.5 Ca0.5 Mn1\u2212y Cry O3 it is possible to induce the\ncoexistence of domains of FM and charge-orbital ordered (CO-OO) phases, which are stable and visible by\nelectron diffraction and by electron and magnetic force\nmicroscopy.13,14 In these cases aging effects in magnetization and conductance have been observed just like those\nrevealed in glassy magnetic or relaxor ferroelectrics. It\nseems that in the CMR manganites this phase separation\nis more overbalanced towards the ferromagnetic component and the insulating CO component is more fluctuating and less coherent, resulting therefore not visible by\ndiffraction. Increasing the Ca doping above 0.50, the CO\nphase becomes long ranged.1\nIn this general context it is of great interest to study\nthe dynamics of these inhomogeneous fluctuating domains. This study is possible by anelastic spectroscopy\nmeasurements, since the elastic constants and the elastic energy dissipation coefficient are strictly connected\n2\n\n\f\u03c0\n2 \u03b4 (\u03c9\u03c4\n\n\u0001\n\u2212 1) . Then \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9, T ) \u2243 \u03c02 \u03c7 (0, T ) g \u03c9 \u22121 , T is directly related to g through a scaling relationship often\nderived from the Vogel-Fulcher law\n\ntion connected with the PI/FM transition has to be subtracted. The peak cannot be identified with the critical\n\u2212\u03b8\nabsorption,15,17 Q\u22121\n, which was found17\nc \u221d \u03c9 (T \u2212 Tc )\nin La0.67 Ca0.33 MnO3 at 10 MHz with \u03b8 = 1.55; indeed,\nthe amplitude of that peak extrapolated to our frequencies becomes smaller than 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 , while the height of\nthe peak in Fig. 2 is 5 \u2212 8 \u00d7 10\u22124 (but is smaller in the\nsamples with higher Ca doping). Whatever the precise\norigin of the absorpion around TC , it can be well fitted with a Lorentzian centred near TC , as shown by the\ncontinuous lines in Fig. 2a. After subtraction of the absorption around TC and of a small linear background, the\ntwo curves in Fig. 2b are obtained. The resulting peak\nshifts to higher temperature with increasing frequency,\nlike a Debye relaxation process with a thermally activated relaxation time \u03c4 , usually following the Arrhenius\nlaw, \u03c4 = \u03c40 exp (E/T ). The response of such a process\nwould be15\n\u22121\n\n\u03c7 (\u03c9, T ) \u221d T \u22121 (1 \u2212 i\u03c9\u03c4 )\n\n,\n\n\u03c4 = \u03c40 exp [E/ (T \u2212 T0 )]\n\nand the condition (2). Following Courtens,18 we tested\nthe data against the expression\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032 = f (T ) R (Ec \u2212 E)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere R (x) = [1 + tanh (bx)] /2 produces the high temperature dispersion, Ec is a constant and E is related\nto \u03c9 and T through Eqs. (2) and (4). The function f (T ) is determined by fitting the frequency independent region of \u03c7\u2032\u2032 , and is found to be well approximated by f (T ) = A exp (W/T ) with W = 4460 K.\nThe dark continuous curves of Fig. 2b, obtained with\n\u03c40 = 5.5 \u00d7 10\u221212 s, T0 = 193 K, Ec = 620 K and\nb = 0.011, demonstrate the glassy nature of the relaxation process just below TC , and the parameter T0 could\nbe interpreted as a freezing temperature; the use of a\nsimple Arrhenius law, putting T0 = 0, yielded a definitely\nworse fit.\nThe same analysis has been carried out for a sample\nwith x = 0.50 nominally, but with actual Ca doping\nslightly below that value, since only the PI/FM transition was detected, and the resistivity curve did not show\nthe expected insulating behavior at low temperature. At\nthis doping the intensity of the glassy relaxation peak\nwas higher, but the background subtraction was less obvious, due to the presence of another peak at lower temperature; for this reason, the simultaneous optimization\nof the background and peak parameters was preferred.\nFigure 3 shows the resulting fit with the same criteria\nused for the x = 0.33 case. The resulting parameters are\nW = 1920 K, \u03c40 = 6.4 \u00d7 10\u22128 s, T0 = 180 K, Ec = 272 K\nand b = 0.0124.\nWhile the above fits demonstrate the close similarity between the dynamics of the inhomogeneities in\nLa1\u2212x Cax MnO3 below TC and a freezing process, most\nof the parameters have little physical meaning. In order to obtain a more physical picture, we also carried out another type of analysis, which was recently\nadopted to describe the dielectric susceptibility of relaxor ferroelectrics.12 The relaxation process is described\nin terms of a distribution of activation energies g (E, T ) =\nE0\u22121 exp [(Ec \u2212 E) /E0 ] with lower cutoff at Ec and a\ntemperature dependent width E0 (T ). The integration of\nthe elementary relaxation function Eq. (1) over g (E, T ),\nassuming the Arrhenius law \u03c4 = \u03c40 exp (E/T ), yields a\nvery simple expression12 of \u03c7\u2032\u2032 , which we generalized including the Vogel-Fulcher law, Eq. (4). The result is\n\n(1)\n\nwhose imaginary part is peaked at a temperature Tm\nsatisfying the condition\n\u03c9\u03c4 (Tm ) = 1 .\n\n(4)\n\n(2)\n\nHowever, in that case the whole dispersion would shift to\nhigher temperature with increasing frequency, whereas\nthe low temperature side of the peak in Fig. 2b, is independent of frequency. In addition, the height of the\npeak increases considerably with temperature, instead\nof decreasing as 1/T . All these features are typical of\nthe dispersion of the imaginary susceptibility of spinglasses, mixed ferroelectric/antiferroelectric systems18 or\nrelaxor ferroelectrics,11,12 and therefore the absorption\npeak seems to originate from the glassy dynamics of some\ninhomogeneous phases, for example from the formation\nand disappearance or reorientiation of the minority insulating nanodomains which are believed to coexist with\nthe FM phase below TC . In order to extract a more\nquantititative signature of the glassy dynamics, we performed on the present data the type of analysis adopted\nfor spin-glasses and their analogues, including the relaxor\nferroelectrics.\nAt first we tested whether the data at different frequencies can be collapsed on a single curve by means of\nan appropriate scaling variable E (\u03c9, T ) related to the\nlaw of the slowing down of the fluctuations. The idea is\nthat the susceptibility can be expressed in terms of superposition of elementary processes, with a very broad\ndistribution g (\u03c4, T ) of relaxation times \u03c4 ,\nZ \u221e\n1\n(3)\nd (ln \u03c4 ) g (\u03c4, T )\n\u03c7 (\u03c9, T ) = \u03c7 (0, T )\n1 \u2212 i\u03c9\u03c4\n\u03c40\n\n\u03c0n\nn\nexp (Ec /E0 ) (\u03c9\u03c40 )\n2 cos (n\u03c0/2)\nT \u2212 T0\n.\nwith n =\nE0\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032 \u2243 \u03c70\n\nso that each contributing peak in the imaginary\npart\ni\nh\n2\ncan be approximated as a \u03b4 function, \u03c9\u03c4 / 1 + (\u03c9\u03c4 ) \u2192\n\n3\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\n\fphase at x \u2265 0.50. In this case the anelastic response\nmay result both from the formation and disappearance\nof the CO state over few lattice constants or from the\nreorientation of the Jahn-Teller distorted stripes.\nRegarding the origin of the glassy dynamics, in some\ncases a broad distribution of the activation energies is\nsupposed to reflect a broad distribution of the sizes of\nthe clusters.12 We rather suggest that the main cause\nof the glassy dynamics is the competition of interactions with different length scales, which may produce\nspatial inhomogeneities with well defined patterns but\nwith glassy dynamics.20 In fact, the relevant interactions\nin the manganites range from the magnetic exchange to\nthe Coulomb and elastic ones. The broadening of the distribution function g (\u03c4, T ) with lowering T can then be\ndue to the frustrated nature of the interactions between\nthe coexisting insulating and metallic regions.\nIn conclusion, the low frequency dynamic susceptibility of La1\u2212x Cax MnO3 , probed by anelastic spectroscopy\nfor 0.33 < x < 0.5, contains the signature of glassy dynamics in the low temperature inhomogeneous ferromagnetic phase. A peak in the elastic energy loss is found\nslightly below the Curie temperature, whose temperature\nand frequency dependences are typical of the dynamic\nsusceptibilities of other perovskite inhomogeneous frustrated systems like the relaxor ferroelectrics, and of spin\nglasses. The data have been analyzed in order to extract the temperature dependent distribution function of\nthe energy barriers of the fluctuations characterizing the\ninhomogeneous state.\n\nThe simple result (6) is valid for n \u2264 1, and therefore\nwe put an upper cutoff to n, which however does not affect the fit for the case x = 0.33, since n approaches 1\nonly in the high temperature region where the curves are\ndropping to zero. The temperature dependence of E0 can\nbe extracted from the frequency independent part of the\ncurves at low temperature, where n \u226a 1 and, initially assuming T0 = 0 for simplicity, \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (T ) \u2243 (\u03c0/2) \u03c70 T /E0 ; as\nalready mentioned, in that region \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (T ) \u2243 A exp (W/T ),\nand therefore we adopted E0 (T ) = cT exp (W/T ), where\nc is a constant. Since W = 2000 \u2212 4500 K, we are in the\nregime were the width E0 (T ) of the distribution function diverges with lowering temperature, as required by\na freezing process. The gray curves of Fig. 2b are obtained with W = 4480 K, c = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22129 , Ec = 880 K,\n\u03c40 = 4 \u00d7 10\u221214 s and T0 = 186 K. The fit is satisfactory,\nconsidering the simplificative hypotheses made for the\ndistribution function of the activation energies, g (E, E0 )\nwith E0 (T ), and characterizes the spectrum of the fluctuations. The relaxation rates are close to \u03c40\u22121 exp (\u2212Ec /T )\nat high temperature, but the spectrum quickly broadens\nwith decreasing temperature, consistently with a freezing\ntemperature T0 \u2243 186 K. In a sense, the broadening of\ng (E, T ) itself should describe the freezing process, without the need of introducing the Vogel-Fulcher law, but\nthe limitation of using a tractable expression for g (E, T )\nmakes it useful the introduction of T0 > 0 for improving\nthe fit. For x = 0.5 (Fig. 3) the condition n \u2264 1 for the\nvalidity of Eq. (6) was shifted to slightly lower temperature, making the fit less meaningful for the data at higher\nfrequency. Anyway, the case x = 0.5 can be described by\nW & 1900 K, Ec & 980 K, \u03c40 \u2264 2 \u00d7 10\u221210 s; the use of\nT0 > 0 does not improve significantly the fit.\nLet us consider now the nature of the fluctuations which are observed in the anelastic spectra of\nLa1\u2212x Cax MnO3 . A first possibility are the FM clusters which are observed on different scales, with the\nanelastic response driven by strong magnetoelastic coupling. Indeed, around TC SANS measurements6 reveal\nthe presence of \"magnetic polarons\" with sizes of the\norder of tens of \u00c5, while in neutron spectroscopy experiments at x = 0.33 a quasielastic components appears, which indicate a diffusive component of the spin\nexcitations, coexisting with the usual spin waves of a\ntypical ferromagnet.5 It should be noted that, although\nthe present measurements probe the very low frequency\npart of the fluctuation spectrum, the resulting distribution of activation energies g (E, T ) acquires weight near\nEc \u2243 880 K with increasing temperature above 220 K;\nthis corresponds to very fast relaxation rates, in the range\nof 10\u221212 s\u22121 , which are the rates probed by neutron spectroscopy. In addition, the relaxation could be connected\nwith the fluctuation of the magnetization in the nanometric FM domains, observed by STM8 and suggested\nby PDF XRD10 and NMR9 experiments. Another possibility is that we observe the CO insulating clusters which\ncoexist with the FM phase, and could consist of diagonal\nMn4+ /Mn3+ stripes, as observed19 in the CO coherent\n\n1\n\nP.
