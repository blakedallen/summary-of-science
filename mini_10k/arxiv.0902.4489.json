The potential impacts of these\nmergers on galaxy evolution are both varied and heavily debated. Mergers can be roughly\ndivided into two classes; minor mergers, in which a small halo is accreted by a substantially\nlarger halo, and major mergers, in which the two halos are of roughly similar mass. The\ndivision between the two is usually placed near a mass ratio of 3:1. Minor mergers contribute\nboth stars and gas to forming galaxies, and are important for understanding the detailed\nmorphologies of galaxies, particularly spiral galaxies. Tidal forces during a minor merger\nmay heat the thin stellar disk and drive bar instabilities, thick disks may also represent the\nremnants of disrupted satellites (Steinmetz & Navarro 2002; Yoachim & Dalcanton 2008).\nThe effects of a major merger are likely more dramatic. Major mergers between two gas\nrich spiral galaxies are a popular mechanism for creating elliptical galaxies, an idea dating\nback to Toomre & Toomre (1972). More recently, they have been invoked as a means of\nfueling intense starbursts and luminous AGN (Mihos & Hernquist 1996; Di Matteo et al.\n2005; Springel et al. 2005b,c, among others).\nTheories connecting major mergers, starbursts, AGN, and the creation of elliptical galaxies have not been suitably tested observationally. Theoretical models can reproduce the\nluminosity function and number density evolution of AGN while correctly recovering correlations between black hole masses and spheroid dynamics (Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000;\nWyithe & Loeb 2002, 2003; Hopkins et al. 2006a). These models include assumptions about\nAGN and starburst lifetimes and efficiencies which tend to be under constrained by the\nobservational data. Additional constraints on these models are needed, as are model independent tests of major merger driven evolutionary scenarios. Environment is a potentially\npowerful probe which has been under exploited in previous work on major mergers. To make\nuse of environment, the environmental dependences of the major merger rate must be well\nunderstood. This work therefore explores the environments of major mergers in the Millennium Simulation, a large N-body simulation with a box length of 500h\u22121 Mpc and a particle\nmass below 109 M (Springel et al. 2005a). This simulation is large enough to probe the full\nrange of environments and has a fine enough mass resolution to follow galaxy-like halos and\nsubhalos. The goal of this project is to provide the theoretical groundwork necessary to use\nenvironment as a probe of merger driven galaxy evolution scenarios.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n1.1.\n\nMajor Mergers, AGN, & Morphology\n\nThe link between major mergers, starburst and AGN fueling, and galaxy morphology\nhas been extensively studied using simulations, and there is strong circumstantial observational evidence that these populations are correlated. Simulations of individual major\nmergers involve imbedding a stellar and gaseous disk into each of two dark matter halos,\nplacing them on a collision course, and observing the stages of the simulated merger. Such\nmodels vary considerably in complexity, ranging from including only stellar disks to modeling\nmultiphase gas disks. They also vary in prescriptions for AGN and star formation fueling.\nThese simulations capture the physics behind the major merger scenario and can predict the\nappearance of the different stages of a major merger (for examples see Mihos & Hernquist\n1996; Springel 2000; Naab & Burkert 2003; Barnes 2004; Springel et al. 2005c; Cox et al.\n2006). Complimentary simulations invoke semi-analytic prescriptions to introduce simplified\ngas physics into large dark matter simulations. These allow the entire population of AGN,\nstarbursts, and galaxy morphologies to be studied (Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000; Wyithe &\nLoeb 2002, 2003).\nThe results of previous theoretical studies of major mergers can be briefly summarized\nas follows. The tightly bound stellar components remain in the center of their dark matter halos, loose angular momentum through gravitational interactions with their own dark\nmatter halos, and remain at the center of the merger remnant. The two stellar components\nencounter each other with a tightly bound orbit, quickly merging after the cores of the dark\nmatter halos have merged. The resulting stellar remnant is pressure supported rather than\nrotationally supported. When no gas component is included, the central densities of simulated major merger remnants are lower than the observed cores of elliptical galaxies. When\ngas is included, tidal forces funnel the gas into the centers of the merging galaxies prior to\nthe galaxies merging. This gas then settles to the center of the merger remnant. Of the\ninitial gas disk, \u2265 50% ends up in the central component of the merger remnant (see review\nin Barnes & Hernquist 1992). Allowing this gas to form stars builds a stellar core in the\nremnant, similar to that seen in elliptical galaxies (Mihos & Hernquist 1996). Gas that is\nfunneled to the centers of the merging galaxies can also fuel AGN activity both in the merging galaxies and in the remnant. When black hole growth and star formation in the merger\nremnants both occur with efficiencies that are proportional to the gas fraction in the central\nregion, semi-analytic models reproduce observed correlations between black hole masses and\nspheroid masses (Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000). Self regulated models of black hole growth\ngo a step further. With abundant fuel, the black hole at the center of the remnant grows\nexponentially both in mass and in luminosity. Feedback from the growing AGN heats and\ndrives winds in the surrounding gas and can become strong enough to expel gas from the\ncenter of the remnant (Silk & Rees 1998; Fabian 1999), terminating both star formation and\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nAGN activity. Self regulated models of black hole growth predict that the ultimate mass of\nthe black hole is strongly correlated with the depth of the central gravitational potential (Di\nMatteo et al. 2005; Springel et al. 2005b,c). Furthermore, nuclear star formation and black\nhole growth are both regulated by the same process (e.g.. Hopkins et al. 2006a). The resulting major merger remnant has a stellar profile which resembles an elliptical galaxy, hosts a\ncentral super massive black hole with a mass that correlates both with the central potential\nand the central stellar density, is gas poor, and has a diffuse halo of hot gas. If this gaseous\nhalo is prevented from cooling and forming stars, the post-starburst remnant will fade to\nbecome 'red and dead'. Feedback between cooling in the nucleus and low level AGN activity\nis often invoked to prevent further star formation in the remnant (Best et al. 2006; Fabian\net al. 2006).\nThere is observational evidence to support this merger driven evolutionary scenario.\nUltraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGS) represent powerful starbursts. Observations of\nULIRG morphologies indicate that they are ongoing or recent major mergers (see reviews in\nSanders & Mirabel 1996; Jogee 2005). Radio observations of these galaxies indicate that they\nhave central concentrations of dense cool gas (Scoville 1986; Sargent 1987, 1989). Powerful\nIR selected starbursts are also known to host obscured or low luminosity AGN (Komossa et\nal. 2003; Gerssen et al. 2004; Alexadner et al. 2005; Borys et al. 2005). The physical number\ndensity of luminous AGN rises with redshift, peaking around z \u223c 2\u22123 (Boyle et al. 2000; Fan\net al. 2001), similar to the major merger rate of massive halos in N-body simulations. Black\nhole growth and spheroidal growth appear to be closely related. Black hole masses correlate\nboth with the mass and the velocity dispersion of the spheroids, either elliptical galaxies or\nspiral bulges, that host them (Magorrian et al. 1998; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Gebhardt\net al. 2000; McLure & Dunlop 2002; Tremaine 2002; Marconi & Hunt 2003). Post-starburst\nE+A (or K+A) galaxies have high central surface densities, kinematically hot older stellar\npopulations, and will fade to resemble elliptical galaxies in the absence of additional star\nformation (Norton et al. 2001; Yang et al. 2004; Goto 2005). Post-starburst galaxies also\nfrequently display disturbed morphologies, indicative of mergers or tidal interactions (Yang\net al. 2004; Goto 2005; Owers et al. 2007). Elliptical galaxies are found preferentially in group\nand cluster environments (Dressler 1980; Norberg et al. 2002; Hogg et al. 2003; Kauffmann\net al. 2004; Blanton et al. 2005), and simulated dark matter halos in equivalent environments\npreferentially experienced major mergers in their pasts (G\u00f6ttlober et al. 2001).\nWe intend to use a dark matter simulation to develop environmental diagnostics of major\nmerger populations that can be used to test the merger driven galaxy evolution scenario. By\ndoing so we are assuming both a one to one correspondence between dark matter mergers\nand galaxy mergers and that the relevant dynamics are dominated by the dark matter. As\ndiscussed above, when the cores of two dark matter halos that each host a galaxy merge,\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nthe galaxy merger is immanent. The final stages of the galaxy merger occur quickly; Cox et\nal. (2006) find that the final galaxy merger in a 1:1 merger takes \u2248 200Myr. While there\nhas been some discussion of 'dark halos' which do not host galaxies (Maccio et al. 2006, and\nreferences therein), this occurs at Vmax well below those considered here. Similarly, their is\nno observational evidence for orphan galaxies (Mandelbaum et al. 2006), and truncated dark\nmatter halos have been observed around galaxies in clusters (Natarajan et al. 2007). A one\nto one correspondence between halo mergers and galaxy mergers is therefore a reasonable\nassumption. While the inclusion of baryons might affect some of the relevant dynamics, dark\nmatter constitutes a strong majority of the matter. Hence, the dynamics is dominated by\nthe dark matter, with possible refinements to be introduced by including baryons. Exploring\nthis issue is a potential topic for future work.\n\n1.2.\n\nMergers & Environment - Previous Results\n\nThe earliest, and simplest, theoretical studies of the merger rate were based on extended\nPress Schechter theory, which was in turn based on linear theory plus spherical collapse\nmodels (Press & Schechter 1974; Bond et al. 1991; Lacey & Cole 1993). Mergers between\nhalos were assumed to occur on the time scale of dynamical friction and mergers between\nsubhalos were neglected. With these assumptions, merger trees can be built analytically\nfor all halos existing today (Kauffmann & White 1993; Somerville & Kolatt 1999). The\nassumption that mergers occur on a dynamical friction timescale can also be applied to\nN-body simulations when subhalos cannot be resolved. Under this assumption, Kauffmann\n& Haehnelt (2000) find that the major merger rate is independent of local environment.\nExtensions of this treatment first considered the merger rate between subhalos, concluding\nthat the sub-sub merger rate could be quite high within group mass hosts. Further work\nbegan to include dynamical effects within the host halo such as tidal stripping. This was\ndone both analytically and with N-body simulations (Mamom 2000; Pe\u00f1arrubia & Benson\n2005; Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2008). Assuming that linear theory is modified only by dynamics\nwithin virialized halos, that is that linear theory correctly describes accretion histories, all\nnon-linear effects are confined to within host halos. In this treatment, correlations between\nthe merger rate and environment on scales beyond the virial radii of the hosts, measured\neither directly or through clustering, arise from convolving any correlations between merger\nrate and host mass with the clustering of the hosts. In general, linear theory breaks down\nwhen tidal forces become important, so some deviations should be expected.\nPrevious treatments of the merger rate between subhalos have found that the specific\nmerger rate, that is the merger rate per halo or galaxy, should be enhanced in groups and\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nsuppressed in clusters. Within a bound virialized halo, where it may be possible to assume\nrelative subhalo velocities are random, the specific major merger rate between subhalos can\nbe expressed as\nRm = nh h\u03c3m vi\nwhere \u03c3m is the merger cross section, v is the relative velocity of the halos, and nh is the\nnumber density of potential interaction or merger partners. Generically, the merger cross\nsection must increase with subhalo mass and be highly dependent on the relative velocities of\nthe subhalos. In clusters, where relative subhalo velocities substantially exceed the internal\nvelocities of the subhalos, merger rates between subhalos are likely suppressed relative to\ndistinct, or non-sub, halos. Groups however appear to represent an environment which\ncombines higher than average halo densities with relative velocities that are conducive to\nmerging.\nMerger cross sections based on simulated encounters between distinct halos of equal mass\npeak near the internal velocity of the halos (Makino & Hut 1997). Using these cross sections\nand assuming a Maxwellian velocity distribution for the subhalos that scales appropriately\nwith host halo mass, Makino & Hut (1997) find that merger rates are enhanced in groups and\ndecline with the mass of the host halo, becoming suppressed in clusters. In this treatment the\nsubhalo merger rate also increases with the mass of the subhalos, as the merger cross section\nincreases. Analytical and numerical treatments indicate that tidal stripping occurs on a\nmuch shorter time scale than dynamical friction, resulting in a population of tidally stripped\nsubhalos for which dynamical friction is ineffective (Mamom 2000; Pe\u00f1arrubia & Benson\n2005; Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2008). In a mass defined subhalo sample, tidal stripping reduces\nthe subhalo number densities by removing subhalos from the sample. In a subhalo sample\nbased on pre-accretion masses, tidal stripping can drastically reduce the subhalo merger\ncross section. Previous work has taken the first approach. When subhalo populations are\nselected using post tidal stripping masses, the specific merger rate is extremely sensitive to\nthe host halo mass and is still enhanced in groups and suppressed in clusters (Mamom 2000).\nNumerical simulations support these analytical results. Ghinga et al. (1998) simulate a\nlarge cluster with a high resolution in order to observe subhalos. They find that halos cease\nmerging once they enter the cluster. De Lucia et al. (2004) also find that the merger rate\ndrops after sub-halos are accreted by a cluster. G\u00f6ttlober et al. (2001) make a complimentary\nmeasurement in a cosmological N-body simulation. They measure the merger rate of the\nmost massive progenitors of the halos identified at z = 0, therefore not counting major\nmergers that result in remnants that later merge with a more massive halo. They find that\nhalos that reside in clusters at z = 0 have the lowest merger rates near z = 0, but had merger\nrates higher than the progenitors of isolated halos in the past. The merger rates for halos\nthat reside in groups at z = 0 are higher than for isolated galaxies.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nStudying the merger rate as a function of host halo mass is attractive because it has\ndirect observational consequences. Doing so may also capture most of the non-linear physics\naffecting the merger rate. Under the assumptions of linear theory, once a halo mass is\nspecified, in this case the mass of the host halo, the accretion history is independent of\nenvironment (White 1996). Several recent studies of halo properties have indicated that\naccretion history does have a residual dependence on local environment (Wechsler et al.\n2006; Croton et al. 2007; Gao & White 2007). There may be a similar dependence between\nthe major merger rate and local environment. This has not yet been studied.\nWhile the environments of major mergers are clearly a widely studied topic, the Millennium Simulation should allow us to make an important advancement. The Millennium\nSimulation, with its superb combination of size and resolution, allows the study of all of the\nabove issues in concert. We will use a common, well defined, language to study these issues\nand, in addition, should be able to see the effects of the interplay between them. Finally,\nwe will focus not only on studying the dynamics of major mergers, but on using definitions\nof environment and the major merger rate that have clear observational counterparts. This\nis essential as the ultimate goal is to use the results of this work to craft observational tests\nthat are capable of identifying merger populations.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nMethods\n\nSimulation & Numerical Issues\n\nOur study is performed using the Millennium Simulation (MS) (Springel et al. 2005a)\nrun using a version of GADGET2 (Springel 2005). The MS is a cosmological N-body simulation of the \u039bCDM universe that follows the evolution of more than 10 billion particles\nin a box of 500h\u22121 Mpc comoving on a side. The particle mass is 8.6 \u00d7 108 h\u22121 M , and\nparticle-particle gravitational interactions are softened on scales smaller than 5h\u22121 kpc. The\nsimulation uses parameters in agreement with the WMAP1 results (Spergel et al. 2003):\n\u03a9m = 0.25, \u03a9\u039b = 0.75, h = 0.73, n = 1 and \u03c38 = 0.9.\nWe use halos drawn from the MS halo catalog. The first step in halo identification is\na friends-of-friends (FOF) group finder which is built into the simulation code. Particles\nseparated by less than 0.2 times the mean particle separation are grouped together in a FOF\ngroup. This combines particles into groups with a mean over-density which is somewhat\nlower than the expected overdensity of virialized halos at low z and approaches the expected\noverdensity as z increases. In post-processing, bound halos are identified within these FOF\ngroups using an improved version of the SUBFIND algorithm (Springel et al. 2001). In each\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nFOF group both a dominant central halo and its subhalos are identified. SUBFIND first\ncomputes the smoothed density field at the positions of all the particles. It then defines\nas possible halos all regions centered around locally overdense points that are bounded by\nthe first isodensity contour to traverse a saddle point in the density. Each halo candidate\nis subjected to a gravitational unbinding procedure. Structures that retain greater than 20\nparticles are kept in the halo catalog and their basic properties are determined.\nIn this study we characterize halos by the maximum of their rotation velocity curve,\nVmax , rather than by their mass. This is largely motivated by our interest in tracking subhalos. Defining mass in the case of subhalos can be problematic. It is not clear that SUBFIND\nprovides reliable subhalo masses, see discussion in Natarajan et al. (2007), and, regardless\nof the specifics of the halo finder, subhalo mass is itself a relatively ill-defined concept. In\naddition, we are interested in comparing the simulation to observations and are therefore\nconcerned primarily with the hypothetical luminosity of the galaxy hosted by the halo or subhalo, and the 'correct' halo measure is therefore the quantity that is most closely correlated\nwith this luminosity. Even a well defined 'tidal mass' is therefore not a suitable measure.\nWhen subhalos are accreted they undergo substantial tidal stripping, but in the majority\nof cases the central galaxy remains intact while the surrounding dark matter halo decreases\nwith mass. The initial correlation between halo mass and galaxy luminosity therefore no\nlonger applies to subhalos.\nUsing Vmax as a proxy for galaxy luminosity is well motivated and does not suffer as\nstrongly from the issues mentioned above. The use of Vmax is justified by an array of successful\ncomparisons between observations and collision-less simulations in which halos are assigned a\ngalaxy luminosity by associating luminosity and Vmax (e.g., Kravtsov et al. 2004a; Tasitsiomi\net al. 2004, 2008). These studies make a case for the hypothesis that, as a measure of the\ncentral halo potential, Vmax quantifies the ability of a halo to allow baryons to cool and form\nstars. Note that while Vmax may not be the only such quantity, these studies indicate that it is\nthe dominant quantity. As a measure of the central halo potential, Vmax is also significantly\nbetter defined for subhalos, thus overcoming a technical issue associated with using tidal\nmasses. While Vmax itself is not immune to the affects of tidal stripping, it has been shown\nto responds to tidal stripping much slower than mass (e.g., Kravtsov et al. 2004b).\nThe results presented here are sensitive to the completion of the halo catalog, which\nincludes both distinct halos and subhalos. The halo catalog with which we work includes\nhalos with Vmax \u2265 120km/s, though our mergers may have progenitor halos with Vmax down\nto 100km/s. The larger complete halo catalog from the Millennium Simulation includes all\nhalos with greater than 20 particles, or a bound mass greater than 1.7 \u00d7 1010 M . We test\nfor a flattening of the Vmax function in our halo catalog and find no sign of incompletion\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ndown to Vmax = 120km/s at z = 0 or z = 4. The relationship between Vmax and mass for\ndistinct halos evolves with redshift in that as redshift increases Mv (Vmax ) decreases. Mass\n3\nscales approximately like Vmax\nat all redshifts, as expected. At redshift z = 0, we expect an\naverage distinct halo with Vmax = 100km/s to have a virial mass Mv \u2248 1.2 \u00d7 1011 M and\ninclude np \u2248 150 bound particles. At z = 4, an average distinct halo with Vmax = 100km/s\nhas a virial mass Mv \u2248 3.3 \u00d7 1010 M and includes np \u2248 38 bound particles. Given the\nrelatively large average particle number, we can be reasonably sure that at z = 0 distinct\nhalos are complete down to Vmax = 100km/s. At z = 4 completion of even distinct halos may\nbegin to be an issue. In general, the effects of halo completion on our results are redshift\ndependent.\nWhile the particle mass resolution of the MS is fine enough for distinct halos, subhalos\nabove the smallest Vmax of interest may suffer from over-merging if inadequate mass and\nforce resolution allow subhalos to be prematurely disrupted. As a subhalo is stripped and\nthe number of bound particles decreases, two-body interactions can cause a subhalo to\nartificially evaporate, and hence the mass resolution can limit the mass, or Vmax , to which\nsubhalos can be reliably identified. Similarly, inadequate force resolution results in subhalos\nwith artificially large cores which are easily disrupted and artificially lost. These problems\ncan be solved with increased mass and force resolution. Ideally one would rerun the MS\nwith different mass and spatial resolution to estimate the impact of these effects, but this\nroute is prohibitively expensive. These issues have initiated multiple numerical studies,\nand as an alternative to rerunning the simulation we will rely on the results of Klypin\net al. (1999). Their results agree with other, similar, numerical studies. Klypin et al.\n(1999) provide a pair of criteria that must be fulfilled in order for over-merging of subhalos\nnot to be important. The authors motivate their conditions analytically before verifying\nthem with ART simulations. In principle they are therefore independent of the specifics of\nthe simulation. They find that at least 20-30 particles are required in order for two-body\nevaporation to be negligible and that the tidal radius of the subhalo must be at least as\nlarge as a couple of spatial resolution lengths. Note that the 20-30 particles refers to the\nnumber of bound particles post-tidal stripping. These limits are not exact, but they highlight\nthe relevant concerns and will be used to indicate approximately when subhalo completion\nbecomes an issue. The possible effects of subhalo completion on our individual results are\ndiscussed in detail in Section 4.4.\nThe final simulation issue which must be considered is the spacing of the simulation\noutputs for which the halo finder is run. There are 64 saved outputs, most of which are\nequally spaced in log(1 + z) between z=20 and z=0. The typical time elapsed between two\nconsecutive outputs is 2-400 Myr. Typical time scales for an accreted halo to merger with\nits host halo are a few to 10 Gyr (Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2008), though we find that in some\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ncases this time scale may be shortened by approximately a factor of 10. Therefore, except\nin some extreme cases, accreted halos are resolved as subhalos in multiple outputs before a\nmerger with the host occurs. This temporal resolution distinguishes this work from some\npast studies (e.g., Klypin et al. 1999).\n\n2.2.\n\nMerger Trees\n\nEvery halo in the MS is associated with a merger tree that contains all of the progenitors\nof that halo during each previous simulation output. The merger tree therefore contains the\nmerger history of each halo. Mergers trees are constructed after halos are identified in the\n64 saved outputs. The spacing of these outputs is dense enough to reliably identify the\ndescendant of nearly every halo in the following timestep. Halos are required to have a\nunique descendant in either the following timestep or, in a small number of cases, the time\nstep after. Identifying all descendants at each timestep defines the merger trees. Descendants\nare identified by tracking particles, each of which is labeled. Every halo in the next timestep\nthat shares particles with the halo under consideration is identified. These particles are\nweighted according to how bound they are to the halo under consideration, with tightly\nbound particles receiving a higher weight. The halo in the following timestep with the\nhighest weighted sum is marked as the unique descendant. This scheme aims at tracking\nthe inner cores of the halos which are less vulnerable to mergers and tidal stripping. The\nconstruction of the merger trees is described in the supplementary information to Springel\net al. (2005a).\nThe merger trees are used to identify major mergers. While all halos have a unique\ndescendant, when a merger has occurred halos have two or more progenitors in the previous\ntimestep. For this work, major mergers are defined using the Vmax ratio of two merger\nprogenitors. The progenitor with the higher Vmax is referred to as the MMP, or most massive\nprogenitor, and that with the lower Vmax as the LMP, or least massive progenitor. For halos\nthat are not the subhalo of a larger halo, Vmax correlates closely with mass. Major mergers\nare defined as having VLMP /VMMP > 0.7. In the case of halos that are not subhalos, this is\nthe equivalent of mergers with less than a 3:1 mass ratio. In the case of subhalos, the mass\nratio of the halos may vary considerably, but the luminosity ratio of the galaxies typically\nhosted in the halos will not.\nTwo definitions of a specific merger rate are used in this paper, where a specific merger\nrate measures the number of mergers per Gyr normalized by the number of halos, as opposed\nto a physical number density of mergers per Gyr. The first rate is a backwards looking merger\nrate, R\u2212 which is defined as the number of major mergers in the last timestep that resulted\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nin remnants with Vmax divided by the number of halos with the same Vmax in the current\nsimulation output, R\u2212 \u2261 Nm\u2212 (Vmax )/Nh (Vmax ). That is R\u2212 measures the fraction of halos\nthat are a remnant of a merger that occurred in the last Gyr. The observational equivalent of\nthis definition is a merger rate measured using morphologically identified merger remnants.\nIt is also the appropriate rate to compare with potential post-merger populations such as\nstarbursts and luminous AGN. A forward looking specific merger rate, R+ , is defined as the\nnumber of halos in the Vmax range of interest that will experience a major merger in the next\ntimestep divided by the number of halos in the same Vmax range in the current timestep,\nR+ \u2261 Nm+ (Vmax )/Nh (Vmax ). The forward looking merger rate measures the fraction of halos\nthat will become the MMP of a major merger in the next Gyr. The observational equivalent\nof R+ is a merger rate measured using pair counts. In these definitions Nm\u2212 and Nm+\ndistinguish mergers that happened in the previous Gyr from those that will happen in the\nnext Gyr.\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\nIn this section results are presented for several different measurements of the evolution\nof and environmental dependence of the major merger rate. The physical motivation for\nexploring each of these measurements is presented in this section, but a full discussion of\neach result is postponed until \u00a74. In what follows, several different classes of dark matter\nhalos are discussed. A 'distinct' halo is any halo that is not a subhalo. A 'subhalo' is bound\nto and resides within the virial radius of a distinct host halo. A distinct halo may host\nsubhalos, and therefore be a 'host' halo, but it cannot itself be a subhalo. While Vmax may\nbe used to designate the maximum circular velocity of any halo, Vh is used specifically for\neither distinct or host halos and Vs specifically for subhalos.\n\n3.1.\n\nEvolution of the Merger Rate\n\nFigure 1 presents the evolution of the merger rate for all halos with Vmax > 175km/s.\nThe right panel displays the evolution of both specific merger rates, R+ and R\u2212 . Comparing\nR+ and R\u2212 demonstrates the differences one might expect when comparing the evolution of\nthe merger rate as determined using different observational techniques, such as identifying\nmerger remnants morphologically and immanent mergers using pair counts. The evolution of\nthe forward looking rate has a shallower slope than the backward looking rate. The backward\nmerger rate, Rm\u2212 \u221d (1 + z)2.2\u00b10.05 and the forward merger rate, Rm+ \u221d (1 + z)1.82\u00b10.01 . Due\nto completion issues at high z the actual slopes may be somewhat steeper. This is discussed\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nin \u00a74.4. The difference between the slopes of the two measures of the merger rate, R\u2212 and\nR+ , is to first order set by the evolution of the Vmax function. As is shown below, at fixed\nredshift the merger rate is relatively independent of Vmax . In addition, the merger rate and\nnumber of halos change only slightly between consecutive simulation outputs. It follows that\nR\u2212\nR+ (t \u2212 dt) Nh (VMMP , t \u2212 dt)\nNh (VMMP )\n\u2248\n\u2248\nR+\nR+ (t)\nNh (Vrem , t)\nNh (Vrem )\nwhere VMMP is the typical Vmax for the most massive progenitor of merger remnants with\nVrem . This ratio is always greater than one, VMMP < Vrem . It increases with redshift as the\nVmax function shifts towards lower values of Vmax and the local slope of the Vmax function\nbecomes steeper. This is consistent with the relationship between R\u2212 and R+ observed in\nFigure 1.\nThe left panel of Figure 1 shows the evolution of the physical density of mergers. The\nphysical number density of merger remnants with Vmax > 175km/s increases with redshift\nlike nm \u221d (1 + z)5.44\u00b10.02 . For comparison the physical number density of halos with Vmax >\n175km/s evolves as nh \u221d (1 + z)3.13\u00b10.03 . Both of these results differ from their mass selected\ncounterparts. In the case of a mass defined halo sample, the evolution of the halo number\ndensity above a lower mass limit is shallower than (1+z)3 as halos are built up over time and\nthe mass function evolves towards higher masses. Similarly, the peak in the physical density\nof mergers at intermediate or high redshift seen in mass selected halo samples is not observed\nfor a Vmax selected halo sample. The decline in the density of mass selected mergers at high\nz is due to the increasing scarcity of halos above a given mass as z increases. The differences\nbetween these two types of samples can be reconciled. The relationship between Vmax and\nhalo mass is evolving. As the redshift increases Mv (Vmax ) decreases. The halo density and\nmerger rate of lower mass halos are being measured at high z.\n\n3.2.\n\nMergers Between Subhalos and Their Host Halos\n\nWhen a halo is accreted by a more massive host halo and becomes a subhalo, it is\npotentially subject to tidal stripping, dynamical friction, unbound and bound collisions with\nother subhalos, and may eventually merge with the host halo. The results presented in the\nnext two subsections examine these issues in the light of their influence on the major merger\nrate. Figures 2 and 3 begin by demonstrating that tidal stripping of subhalos is occurring\nin the Millennium Simulation. These figures show subhalo number density contours in the\nlog[np/np(Vmax )] versus ro /rvh plane at z = 0 and z = 1, where r0 /rvh is the current orbital\nradius of the subhalo divided by the virial radius of the host halo. Contours are shown for all\nsubhalos, and for subhalos with Vs /Vh > 0.7 and 0.94, corresponding to approximate, pre-\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\naccretion, mass ratios, mvs /Mvh , of 3:1 and nearly 1:1 (1:1.2), where mvs is the virial mass\nof the subhalo and Mvh the virial mass of the host halo. Here log[np/np(Vmax )] is a measure\nof the tidal stripping a subhalo has experienced. Specifically, np is the number of particles\nthat remain bound to the subhalo and np(Vmax ) is the typical number of bound particles in\na distinct halo with the same Vmax . Distinct halos exhibit a well defined correlation between\nnp and Vmax with small but measurable scatter, as expected. Therefore, log[np/np(Vmax )] is\na well defined substitute for log(mts /mvs ), where mts is tidal mass of the subhalo. The three\npanels correspond to subhalos residing in galaxy-like host halos, 175 < Vh (km/s) < 380,\ngroup-like host halos, 380 < Vh (km/s) < 500, and a combination of rich group-like host\nhalos, 500 < Vh (km/s) < 950 and cluster-like host halos, 950 < Vh (km/s). Later 'group-like'\nand 'cluster-like' host halos will be distinguished from halos that actually host groups and\nclusters.\nThe least massive progenitors of sub-host major mergers are subject to the same tidal\nstripping as all subhalos. In Figures 2 and 3 it can be clearly seen that subhalos with Vs /Vh\nvalues that for distinct halos would corresponding to 3:1 and lower mass ratios are accreted\nand effectively tidally stripped by the larger, host, halo. The exception to this is the case\nof subhalos with Vs /Vh values near 1:1 which show a spur at high log[np/np(Vmax )] within\nthe virial radius of the host. The density contours for subhalos with Vs /Vh corresponding\nto major sub-host mergers lie above the densest contours for all halos, consistent with these\nsubhalos as a small random subset of all halos. While these subhalos are found primarily at\nlarge radii, there is no significant difference in the distribution of Vs /Vh at different ro /rvh .\nFigure 4 shows the distribution of VLMP /VMMP for all major mergers resulting in galaxylike, group-like, and rich group and cluster-like remnants. Major mergers are dominated by\nthe Vmax equivalent of mass defined 2:1 and 3:1 mergers. Only a few percent of mergers\nare close to 1:1 mergers. Comparing Figure 4 with Figures 2 and 3 demonstrates that most\nmergers occur in the regime where the least massive progenitor (LMP) is first accreted as a\nsubhalo, and tidally stripped, before it merges with the MMP, its host halo. It is assumed\nin what follows that the vast majority of mergers can be cleanly separated into sub-host and\nsub-sub mergers.\nFigure 5 presents both the forward looking, left panel, and backward looking, right\npanel, merger rate for sub-host mergers resulting in group-like halos. Dynamical friction is\nnot effective at degrading the orbits of tidally stripped subhalos (Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2008).\nDespite this the R+ for sub-host mergers can reach values as high as a merger every one to\na few Gyr, as can be seen in the left panel of Figure 5. This suggests that the dynamics of\nthese systems are not completely captured by considering a combination tidal stripping and\ndynamical friction alone. In addition to interacting with their host, subhalos also interact\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nwith each other, motivating us to examine whether the presence of multiple subhalos affects\nthe sub-host merger rate.\nIn the left panel of Figure 5, R+ is plotted for host halos with 345 < Vmax (km/s) < 455\nand 1, 2, and greater than 1 subhalo, ns = 1, 2, and > 1. The subhalo counts include\nall subhalos with Vmax > 120km/s. To compute this rate, at each time-step the number of\nmajor merger remnants in the next time-step with a most massive progenitor with 345 <\nVmax (km/s) < 455 and with one fewer subhalo than the ns of interest, is divided by the\nnumber of halos in the current time-step with 345 < Vmax (km/s) < 455 and the desired\nns. This assumes, for example, that all merger remnants with no subhalos are the result\nof a merger between a host and its single subhalo. The time-step is small enough that\nthe occurrence of a sub-host merger and the accretion of a new subhalo within the same\ntime-step should be rare enough not to effect these results. When this does occur it will\nbias against the result observed. The right panel of Figure 5 shows the number of merger\nremnants with 380 < Vmax (km/s) < 500 divided by the number of halos in this Vmax range\nin the same timestep. This Vmax range roughly corresponds to the remnants of the mergers\nplotted in the left-hand panel. In this panel the number of merger remnants with the ns of\ninterest is divided by the number of all halos with the same ns. While the left hand panel\nbest captures any dynamics, the right hand panel is easiest to compare with observations.\nParticularly in groups, it is a backward looking rate, a rate calculated using mergers that\nhave already happened, that is easiest to observe. A forward looking merger rate necessarily\nrelies on pair counts.\nThe specific forward looking merger rate in host halos that have two subhalos is approximately 10 times the specific merger rate in host halos with only one subhalo pre-merger.\nThe distribution of Vs /Vh for host halos within this narrow range in Vh does not depend on\nns; a host halo with two subhalos is only twice as likely to host a subhalo with Vs > 0.7Vh , a\npotential major merger LMP. If the existence of multiple subhalos did not affect the dynamics of sub-host mergers, then host halos with two subhalos would experience major mergers\ntwice as often. This effect is reflected in the backwards looking merger rate. The frequency\nof merger remnants among host halos with ns > 0 is several times larger than the frequency\namong host halos without a subhalo with Vmax > 120km/s. Conversely, at low redshifts,\nwhere the effects of subhalo completion are less important, a second subhalo is present for\n80-90% of the sub-host mergers in group-like halos. Differences between the two panels of\nFigure 5 are mainly due to the ratios Nh (ns = 1)/Nh (ns = 0) and Nh (ns = 2)/Nh (ns = 1).\nIn the right panel, mergers of hosts with lone subhalos are normalized by the number of halos\nwith no subhalos rather than the number of halos with one subhalo. These ratios evolve\nwith redshift. Interactions between subhalos are examined in the next section and a physical\nmechanism for enhancing the sub-host merger rate is advanced.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n3.3.\n\nMergers Between Subhalos\n\nObservationally, galaxies can be separated into 'isolated' galaxies and members of groups\nor clusters. Previous works based on mass defined subhalo samples find that the specific\nmerger rate is enhanced in groups. By selecting subhalos based on mass, these works treat\ntidal stripping by excluding tidally stripped subhalos. In this section, we take the next step\nby using a Vmax defined subhalo sample to determine if the observed specific merger rate is\nindeed expected to be higher in groups than for isolated galaxies.\nObservational group finding algorithms seek to identify bound virialized objects by\nfinding over-densities in the projected galaxy density within a narrow redshift range. The\nsimulation equivalent is a host halo with its subhalos. Accordingly, groups in the simulation\nare defined as group-like halos, 380 < Vh (km/s) < 500, that host at least two subhalos with\nVmax > 120km/s within their virial radius. Group members include the host halos and its\nsubhalos. Rich groups are defined as rich group-like halos, 500 < Vh (km/s) < 950, with\nat least two subhalos. The observational equivalent to these simulation groups would be\na catalog of groups containing at least three member galaxies, the central galaxy and two\nsatellites.\nIn addition to the evolution of the physical number density of all mergers, the right\npanel of Figure 1 displays the physical number density of mergers of all group members.\nFigure 1 also includes the physical number density of mergers between two subhalos, or subsub mergers. Specifically, Figure 1 shows the number of merger remnants that are subhalos\nof group hosts and of rich group hosts. Mergers within groups account for a small percentage\nof all mergers. Sub-sub mergers make up roughly 10% of the mergers that occur in group\nenvironments and a fraction of a percent of all mergers. The simulation groups host 2-3\nsubhalos on average, depending on the redshift, and the specific merger rate for subhalos\nis 20-30 times lower than the specific merger rate for the host halos of groups. This is in\ndirect contrast with the results of studies using mass selected subhalos. In host halos with\nVh < 320km/s, it is somewhat more common for a subhalo to be a merger remnant. This\noccurs most frequently for subhalos with Vs /Vh \u2248 1 which does not correspond to a true\nsub-sub merger, but rather a sub-host merger in disguise. Not only are mergers between\nsubhalos rare in an absolute sense, the specific merger rate of subhalos, or the frequency of\nmerger remnants among subhalos, is low. Major mergers are dominated by sub-host mergers.\nTogether the sub-host merger rate and sub-sub merger rate determine the specific merger\nrate among group members. In Figure 6, R\u2212 is plotted versus redshift for all halos, group\nmembers ('Group Members, r/rv < 1'), and members of rich groups ( 'Rich Group Members,\nr/rv < 1'). An alternate definition of a group is also used that requires the host halo have two\n'subhalos' within the dark matter FOF group surrounding the central host halos and includes\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nall subhalos within the FOF group as group members. Groups thus defined are designated\n'Group Members, all'. In a similar fashion, observational group finding algorithms vary in\nhow conservatively they define groups and group members. As can be seen in Figure 6, the\nspecific merger rate among group members is in fact lower than for all, or for 'isolated', halos\nin a Vmax selected halo sample. It is also likely to be suppressed in groups constructed from\nluminosity selected galaxy samples. The specific merger rate is lower for rich group members\nthan group members and the specific rate for generously defined groups, 'Group Members,\nall', is lower than for conservatively defined group members, 'Group Members, r/rv < 1'.\nPrevious analytical work has shown that for mass selected subhalos the sub-sub merger\nrate decreases drastically with host halo mass while increasing with subhalo mass. For\nexample Mamom (2000) finds R+ \u221d nG2 m2s /Vh3 . These generic dependences arise for a\nrange of specific analytical cross sections. It is interesting to check whether similar scalings\noccur for Vmax selected subhalos in order to determine if one should expect to observe these\ntrends for real galaxies. Somewhat surprisingly, no such trend is observed for the Vmax\nselected subhalos. The forward looking merger rate, R+ , for sub-sub mergers is significantly\nsuppressed relative to the sub-host merger rate and shows no dependence on either Vh or Vs .\nThe lower specific merger rate for group members of rich groups, as opposed to the subhalos\nin rich groups, is due to the increased contribution of subhalos.\nThe absence of a trend with Vh is somewhat startling as the relative velocities of subhalos\nare higher in clusters than in groups. The key to this puzzle may be the relatively large\nmasses of the subhalos studied. The analytic result assumes that the number of subhalos\nscales with Mvh , resulting in a constant number density of subhalos. In the simulation, while\nthe average number of subhalos with Vmax > 175km/s does increase approximately as Vh3 ,\nthe average number of these somewhat massive subhalos ranges from < 1 to a few. For\ngroup-like host halos there are multiple hosts that host only one such subhalo for every host\nwith two or more such halos. The number of halos that host multiple large subhalos and are\ntherefore capable of hosting a sub-sub merger increases with Vh , off setting the increase in\nrelative velocities between subhalos. A simulation with a finer mass resolution may reveal a\ncorrelation between R+ and Vh . It is less surprising that no trend is observed between R+ for\nsub-sub mergers and Vs . First, while sub-sub mergers may be more likely among subhalos\nwith higher post-tidal stripping masses, and subhalo mass and Vs are loosely correlated,\nthere is significant scatter in the mass-Vs relation of subhalos. Second, major mergers are\ndefined differently in the two scenarios. For Vs defined subhalos, the case of two merging\nsubhalos with similar Vs is marked as a major merger even if one subhalo is newly arrived and\nthe other significantly tidally stripped. Conversely, a merger of two subhalos with similar\nmasses and different degrees of stripping will not be considered a major merger if the Vs are\nsignificantly different. The sub-sub merger rate may depend on the subhalo mass without\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nsuch a dependence being observed in a Vs defined subhalo sample. As a final consideration,\nthe relatively low number of mergers between subhalos results in poor statistics, and a weak\npotential dependence on Vh or Vs would therefore not be observed. This leaves open the\npossibility that a weak trend observed in a large survey would not be inconsistent with the\nsimulation results.\n\n3.4.\n\nMerger Rate vs Local Halo Density\n\nFigure 7 shows R\u2212 versus local density for all halos with Vmax > 175km/s in the left\npanel, and in the right panel displays R\u2212 versus Vmax for all halos in all environments. Both\nare shown for z = 0, 1, and 2. The local density is the count of all halos, both distinct and\nsub, with Vmax > 120km/s within a sphere of radius 2h\u22121 Mpc comoving. The halo sample\nis complete to lower values of Vmax than the merger sample, simply because both progenitor\nhalos must be resolved in order to identify a merger. This allows a the use of a lower Vmax\nto measure the environment, which has the advantage of sampling the environment more\naccurately. The insets in Figure 7 are provided for orientation.\nA correlation between the merger rate and either local environment or Vmax would be\nstraight forward to compare with observations. Unfortunately, there is little dependence of\nthe merger rate on environment or Vmax independently. The merger rate does decline slightly\nabove local densities of 15-20 at z = 0 and 1, and at slightly lower densities at z = 2. As can\nbe seen by referring to the insets, however, the vast majority of halos reside in environments\nwith lower densities, where the merger rate is constant with local density.\nRecent work has shown that codependent correlations between halo properties such as\nconcentration or age and both Vmax , or mass, and local environment do exist in large N-body\nsimulations (Wechsler et al. 2006; Croton et al. 2007; Gao & White 2007). In Figure 8 R\u2212\nis plotted versus the local environment for halos in three Vmax ranges for z = 0, 1, and\n2. The Vmax ranges used are 175 < Vmax (km/s) < 280, 280 < Vmax (km/s) < 380, and\n380 < Vmax (km/s) < 900. These are different than the Vmax ranges used previously and have\nbeen selected to highlight the evolution of the trends observed in Figure 8. Halos in the\nintermediate Vmax range evolve from moderately biased at z = 2 to relatively unbiased at\nz = 0 while halos in the upper and lower Vmax ranges are biased and unbiased, respectively,\nat all three redshifts. The left panel includes all halos that are either the central halo of\ntheir dark matter FOF group or are beyond the virial radius of their central halo. These\nhalos are selected because linear theory predicts that, when true subhalos are excluded, R\u2212\nat fixed Vmax should be independent of local environment. In contrast, in the simulation the\nhalos with the lowest values of Vmax show a slight trend of decreasing R\u2212 with local density,\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nand the halos with the highest values of Vmax show a slight trend of increasing R\u2212 with local\ndensity.\nDistinct halos in the vicinity of a more massive halo, that is halos under the dynamical\ninfluence of a nearby massive halo, may be subject to different dynamics than more isolated\ndistinct halos. The right panel of Figure 8 shows R\u2212 versus the local density for only halos\nthat are the central halo of their FOF group, hence excluding distinct halos that are on the\noutskirts of a more massive halo. Only the two lower Vmax ranges are plotted in the right\npanel. The right panel of Figure 8 emphasizes the interaction between central halos, which\ndominate their immediate environment, and environment on intermediate scales. There are\ntwo points of note when comparing the two panels of Figure 8. First, for the lowest Vmax\nrange R\u2212 versus local density is significantly flatter in the right panel. Second, in the right\npanel the trend for the mid Vmax range evolves from a R\u2212 that increases with local density\nat z = 2 to an absence of a trend at z = 0. This is in contrast to a relatively flat relation\nbetween R\u2212 and environment at all redshifts for the same Vmax range in the left panel.\nFor Figures 7 and 8, it is appropriate to include both distinct halos and subhalos in\nthe local environment definition. Ideally, one would plot the trends shown in Figure 8\nfor dark matter over-density rather than halo number density, which unfortunately has no\nobservational equivalent. This ideal is best approached by including subhalos as the local\nhalo count is thereby implicitly weighted by both the mass and proximity of nearby halos.\nA massive halo near the edge of the 2h\u22121 Mpc sphere contributes to the local density by as\nmany of it's subhalos as lie within the sphere. As was observed in Section 3.2, however, the\nsub-host merger rate increases with the number of subhalos so it is prudent to examine how\nthis correlation affects the results presented here.\nThe correlation between the number of subhalos and the merger rate may bias the\nresults in the sense that increasing the number of subhalos will increase both the merger\nrate and the local halo count. This biases against observing the trend observed for halos in\nthe low Vmax range, but has the same sense as the trend observed for the high Vmax range.\nThe number of subhalos in a host is typically smaller than the range of environments plotted,\nwhich is expected given that the virial radii of these halos is smaller than 2h\u22121 Mpc. While\nchecking for this bias we found a direct correlation between the number of subhalos in a\nhost and the local environment excluding the hosts own subhalos. This is consistent with\nthe results of Wechsler et al. (2006). This correlation may drive the observed trend between\nthe major merger rate and the local environment given the significant increase in the major\nmerger rate for hosts with multiple subhalos.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis section discusses possible physical mechanisms behind the results presented in the\nprevious section and compares the results to observations from the literature.\n\n4.1.\n\nEvolution of the Merger Rate\n\nFigure 1 emphasizes that for distinct halos it is the growth of structure, set by cosmology\nand the initial matter distribution, that sets the merger rate. The evolution of both R\u2212 and\nR+ is significantly flatter than that of nh . While nh \u221d (1+z)3.13\u00b10.03 , R\u2212 \u221d (1+z)2.2\u00b10.05 and\nR+ \u221d (1 + z)1.82\u00b10.01 . The evolution of the major merger rate likely depends on the sample\nselection, is affected by subhalo completion, and is complicated by any evolution in the LVmax relation. We therefore refrain from predicting a slope of the evolution of the merger rate,\nbut these caveats aside expect that the major merger rate evolves more slowly than the halo\nnumber density. Additionally, within a single galaxy sample, the merger rate as measured\nusing close pair counts and using morphologically identified mergers will evolve differently.\nWhen the possible effects of sample selection are also taken into account, comparing the\nevolution of the merger rate as determined using different techniques on different samples\nshould be undertaken with great caution.\nG\u00f6ttlober et al. (2001) consider a third measure of the evolution of the specific merger\nrate in which only halos that belong to a MMP chain of a halo identified at z = 0 are\nconsidered. They select halos using Vmax at z = 0. They find that this rate evolves as\n(1 + z)\u223c3 , which is steeper than our result for all major mergers. One might expect that the\nspecific merger rate along the MMP chain and the specific merger rate for all halos would\nevolve with the same slope. This assumes that the likelihood of a halo remaining on the\nMMP chain is independent of merger history. That is, that both major merger remnants\nand all halos are each as likely as the other either to continue as a MMP or to become an\nLMP. That G\u00f6ttlober et al. (2001) measure a steeper rate than found in this work suggests\nthat halos which undergo major mergers are more likely to survive as part of a MMP chain.\nThis dependence is only suggested by these results. While the merger rate measured here\nincludes halos with the same Vmax at all redshifts, the average Vmax of the progenitor halos in\na MMP chain decreases with redshift. This comparison emphasizes the importance of both\nmeasuring the merger rate as G\u00f6ttlober et al. (2001) have in order to compare morphologies\nat z = 0 to merger history and also measuring the merger rate as is done here in order to\ncompare to the observed evolution of the merger rate. It is not correct either to integrate\nthe merger rate observed here in order to compare with morphologies at z = 0 or to compare\nobserved merger rates to the evolution measured by G\u00f6ttlober et al. (2001).\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nPrevious observations of the evolution of the major merger rate, using both pair counts\nand morphologies, have found a wide range of slopes when the evolution is characterized as\nRm \u221d (1 + z)m . Most are flatter than m = 3, with some that are actually consistent with\nno evolution. For both methods, previous results can be roughly split between groups that\nfind m = 2 \u2212 4 (Le F\u00e8vre et al. 2000; Patton et al. 2002; Conselice et al. 2003; Cassata et\nal. 2005; Kampczyk et al. 2007) and m < 1 (Carlberg et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2004; Lotz et al.\n2008). There are many differences between these studies including sample selection, merger\nselection, pair selection, and whether the evolution is measured within a single sample or by\ncomparing two or more samples. In general, stricter dynamical requirements on pair counts\nresult in steeper evolution. Berrier et al. (2006) find that pair counts in simulations show little\nevolution because the decline in the merger rate is counterbalanced by the build up of groups\nand clusters. Measurements at high redshift rely on morphologically identified mergers which\ncan be complicated by resolution, loss of low surface brightness features, and by observing\ngalaxies at non-ideal rest frame wavelengths. Automated morphological measurements may\nalso have difficultly separating major mergers from galaxies with asymmetric star formation.\nWhile individual groups do attempt to quantify and correct for these effects, the disparity\nbetween different measurements indicates there is more work to be done. Our prediction\nthat the major merger rate evolves with a flatter slope than the number density of galaxies\ncannot yet be compared to such disparate observations.\n\n4.2.\n\nGroups and Clusters\n\nIn the MS subhalos of all Vs /Vh are tidally stripped of similar mass fractions, which is\nconsistent with theoretical expectations. A simple model of tidal stripping, which assumes\nthat subhalo orbits are nearly circular and that the host-halo and the newly accreted subhalos\nshare a self similar density profile, for example an NFW profile, predicts that mts /mvs =\nMh (ro )/Mvh , where m denotes the mass of the subhalo before and after tidal stripping, M\nthe mass of the host, and ro the orbital radius of the subhalo within the host. Mamom (2000)\npresents an analytical estimate of the tidal mass of a subhalo with an NFW profile orbiting\nin an NFW host in which the correlation between mass and concentration and the typical\norbits of subhalos in NFW hosts have been considered (their equation 8). In Figure 2 the\ndiagonal lines in the left and right panels correspond to this analytical estimate in groups\nand clusters respectively. The left line is simply the estimate given in Mamom (2000), and\nthe right line is this estimate shifted to higher log(ro /rvh ) by 0.3. As long as some subhalos\nhave made one peri-centric passage, the average peri-centric radius, rp /rvh of subhalos found\nat each ro /rvh is lower than ro /rvh itself. Scatter about this relationship can be introduced\nby scatter in the relationship between Vmax and np, deviations from circular orbits, and\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nscatter in the concentrations of the host-halo and subhalo density profiles. Subhalos that lie\nin the bulge to the lower left of the contour plot are likely subhalos on radial orbits that have\npassed through their peri-center at least once. The contours presented in Figures 2 and 3\nare clearly consistent with representing tidal stripping of subhalos in the MS, that is the MS\nappears to be correctly capturing tidal stripping of subhalos.\nThe MS also appears to correctly capture the interplay between tidal stripping and\ndynamical friction. Before a major merger can occur, the stripped LMP must lose its orbital energy and angular momentum. The dynamical friction time scales of these stripped\nsubhalos, which retain only 10-30% of their original mass, are quite long. Boylan-Kolchin et\nal. (2008) consider the interplay between tidal stripping and dynamical friction by running\nhigh resolution simulations of a lone subhalo that is accreted by and eventually merges with\nits host. Their results indicate that the merger time-scale for major mergers likely ranges\nfrom \u2248 3.5 to 7 Gyr, with longer time-scales for lower mvs /Mvh and higher circularities.\nMajor mergers are dominated by mergers with initial mass ratios closer to 3:1 than 1:1, and\nare therefore expected to have the extremely long merger time-scales closer to the long end\nof this range. Our results using the MS are consistent with those of Boylan-Kolchin et al.\n(2008). Assuming that all host halos with a single subhalo at z = 1 whose single subhalo has\nVs /Vh > 0.7 experience a merger at z = 0 correctly predicts the major merger rate among\nhalos with a single subhalo at z = 0. This is of course a very rough consistency check, but\nit indicates that the MS is correctly capturing both tidal stripping and dynamical friction.\nThe significantly enhanced sub-host major merger rate when all hosts, including those\nwith multiple subhalos, are considered indicates that some dynamics beyond tidal striping\nplus dynamical friction is at work. This is confirmed by considering the effect on the sub-host\nmerger rate of introducing a second subhalo; doubling the number of subhalos increases the\nsub-host merger rate by a factor of 10, not a factor of 2. Mergers, or bound collisions, between subhalos are rare, likely due to the small merger cross section of tidally stripped halos.\nUnbound collisions between subhalos in groups and clusters are likely quite common, and\nan unbound collision between subhalos with opposing angular momentum has the potential\nto reduce the orbital energy and angular momentum of both subhalos. Assuming elastic unbound collisions, angular momentum can be effectively scattered between subhalos, but not\neffectively cancelled. An analytical treatment of this problem that assumes inelastic collisions\nfinds no enhancement for the sub-host merger rate from sub-sub interactions (Pe\u00f1arrubia &\nBenson 2005). In reality, however, sub-sub interactions are extremely inelastic, as indicated\nby studying the mass loss induced by these interactions (Knebe et al. 2006). In the case\nof inelastic collisions, subhalos with opposing angular momenta can effectively dump both\norbital energy and angular momentum when they experience an unbound collision. Given\ninelastic collisions between subhalos, the presence of another, or several, other subhalos of\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\ncomparable mass or Vmax may considerably shorten the time it takes a subhalo to merge\nwith its host. That this is occurring requires further study, but it is both physically plausible and consistent with our results. Correctly predicting the sub-host merger rate requires\nconsidering tidal stripping, dynamical friction, and interactions between sub-halos.\nWhile previous results have suggested that the specific merger rate may be enhanced\nin groups, for a Vmax selected halo sample the merger rate in the simulation equivalent\nof groups is suppressed relative to that for distinct halos. The sub-host merger rate is\nenhanced in groups, but subhalos dominate numerically in groups and have extremely low\nspecific merger rates. Note that the specific merger rate of group 'members', as opposed\nto subhalos, declines with group mass, reflecting the increasing numeric dominance of the\nsubhalos. When attempting to compare an observed specific merger rate in groups with the\nrate in the simulations it should be kept in mind that the predicted rate may depend quite\nheavily on the construction of the group catalog. As can be seen in Figure 6, the specific\nmerger rate is lower for generously defined groups than for conservatively defined groups.\nBased on our results we can make several observational predictions about the major\nmerger rate. First, we find that mergers are dominated by sub-host mergers and that the\nspecific merger rate of sub-host mergers is 20-30 times larger than for sub-sub mergers.\nAs a result, the major merger rate among all group members is suppressed relative to the\nfield, contrary to previous predictions. Second, the strong enhancement of the merger rate\nin halos hosting multiple subhalos can be tested observationally. The simulation results\npredict that merger remnants should be more likely than an average galaxy, hosted in a halo\nof the same mass as the merger remnant, to have a fainter near-by companion, which is\nlikely bound to the merger remnant. Similarly, when observationally identified mergers are\ncross correlated with a fainter galaxy sample, mergers are predicted to show a significantly\nenhanced correlation on small scales, that is scales corresponding to the one-halo term of\nthe correlation function.\nMcIntosh et al. (2007) study the major merger rate in groups by identifying morphologically disturbed close pairs of galaxies. They find that a slight majority of mergers involve the\ncentral galaxy of a group and that the specific merger rate for central galaxies is \u2248 3% and\nfor satellite galaxies is less than 1%. Their observations agree qualitatively, but not quantitatively, with the simulation results presented here. When translating the simulation results\ninto observational predictions, any scatter between the Vmax of the host halo and luminosity,\nas well as any uncertainties in the observations, will tend to result in observational results\nthat are less extreme than the simulation results. That is, while the difference between the\nspecific merger rate of host halos and of sub-halos may differ by a factor or 20-30 in the\nsimulations, a factor of 10 or less difference in the observations may be consistent. McIntosh\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\net al. (2007) also find that the sub-sub specific merger rate declines with the mass of the\nhost group. Their groups have an average of \u2248 5 members and all have multiple sub-halos.\nThey therefore avoid the contribution of group-like halos with only one sub-halo and appear\nto capture the effect of increasing relative sub-halo velocities with group mass.\nPrevious theoretical and observational results have indicated that starbursts and AGN\nshow an excess of companion galaxies on small scales. Thacker et al. (2006) study the AGNgalaxy cross correlation in a SPH simulation in which AGN are fueled by major mergers\nand find an excess at small scales compared to the galaxy-galaxy correlation. Goto (2005)\ncross correlate 266 E+A galaxies in the SDSS with the SDSS imaging catalog and find that\nE+A galaxies have an excess of companions on scales < 150kpc when compared to normal\ngalaxies. Serber et al. (2006) preform a similar analysis for AGN and find an excess of\ncompanions on similar scales. Previous studies of companion frequencies have suggested\nthat tidal interactions with the companion trigger activity. We offer an alternative scenario\nin which activity was triggered by a major merger which was facilitated by the companion.\nThe companion galaxies must also have lost considerable angular momentum, hence their\nsmall distances from the active galaxy.\n\n4.3.\n\nMajor Merger Rate and the Assembly Bias\n\nWhile the major merger rate shows no independent correlation with either local environment or Vmax for the Vmax range considered, R\u2212 does correlate with the local environment\nat fixed Vmax . The sense and size of this correlation is similar to so called 'assembly biases'\nseen for related halo properties such as concentration and age. The results presented in \u00a73.4\nprovide insight into the potential physical mechanisms driving this correlation.\nThere is no theoretical reason that the major merger rate should not depend on environment or on Vmax , and it may be a coincidence that no such correlations are observed.\nHalos with lower Vmax values are found on average in lower density environments and the\naverage Vmax increases with local overdensity. If this were not the case, then the observed\ncodependent correlations would require that the merger rate decline with increasing local\ndensity. These trends appear to conspire to produce no observed dependence on environment\nwhen the full Vmax range is included, a result which may not hold to lower Vmax . A slight\ncorrelation between the merger rate and the halo mass has been observed previously in the\nMS (Fakhouri & Ma 2008). The absence of this trend in the results presented here is likely\ndue to the scatter between halo mass and Vmax .\nIn linear theory the formation history of a halo of fixed mass, which is captured by\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nR\u2212 , does not depend on environment. This is not what is observed in the Millennium\nSimulation. Similar deviations from the expectations of linear theory have recently been\nobserved in simulations for other halo properties such as halo formation time, concentration,\nnumber of subhalos, subhalo mass function, and halo angular momentum (Wechsler et al.\n2006; Croton et al. 2007; Gao & White 2007). The correlation between the likelihood of\nhaving experienced a recent major merger and the local environment may be yet another\nfacet of what has been termed the 'assembly bias'. These correlations are all closely related\nthrough halo's assembly histories. Younger halos are also less concentrated (Navarro et al.\n1997; Wechsler et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2003), and a halo that has recently experienced a\nmajor merger is younger. Halos that host a higher than average number of subhalos are\nmore likely to experience, and to have experienced, a major merger. Previous studies have\nall found that the size of the assembly bias is small, and the results here are consistent with\nthis. For the range of local environments in which the majority of halos find themselves, the\nmerger rate is relatively independent of environment.\nLinear theory is based on the spherical collapse model, in which the radial evolution of\nshells of dark matter is determined by the mass contained within each shell. Tidal forces\nare neglected, as are the orbits and interactions of previously virialized halos within these\nshells. The role of tidal forces has been previously acknowledged; the halo mass function\ncan be predicted correctly only if tidal forces are included in an average sense (Sheth &\nTormen 1999). Tidal forces, halo orbits, and interactions between bound halos, all analogs\nof the dynamics within host halos, must contribute to the non-linear trends observed in\nlarger simulations.\nTidal stripping within FOF groups is occurring beyond the virial radii of the central\nhalos. Figures 2 and 3 include all FOF non-central halos. The relationship between tidal\nmass and ro /rvh extends beyond the viral radius of the FOF central halo to radii of a few\nrvc . Note that this is predicted by the analytical estimate of Mamom (2000). When a halo\ngets within a few virial radii of a more massive halo, the weak tidal forces in the outskirts\nlikely suppresses the major merger rate of the halo by decreasing accretion onto them. In\nthe right panel of Figure 8, which excludes halos on the outskirts of more massive halos, no\ncorrelation between major merger rate and environment is observed at z = 0 and 1 for the\nlow Vmax halos and the correlation is considerably reduced at z = 2.\nHalos which are destined to be accreted by a larger halo have always been bound to\nthe larger halo in that their orbital energy with respect to the host halo has always been\nnegative. These halos are not on radial orbits, however. Major mergers in simulations have\na range of initial orbital parameters, with a distribution of orbital circularities, j/jc (E), that\npeaks near 0.5 (Khochfar & Burkert 2006). These bound halos are subject to dynamical\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nfriction and to unbound collisions with other halos that may cause them to be prematurely,\nwhen compared to linear theory, accreted by the central host halo. Despite the fact that\nthese halos are only mildly tidally stripped, dynamical friction is likely ineffective in the low\ndark matter densities beyond the virial radius of the central halo. Both relative velocities\nbetween orbiting halos and the number density of bound objects are also lower beyond\nthe virial radius. Unbound collisions between these objects, which will be rarer but more\neffective, may be an effective means of driving halos into the central host. If this is the case,\nthen group-like halos in dense environments will experience somewhat enhanced accretion\nrates of bound objects, have larger subhalos counts, and higher major merger rates. This\nof course assumes that the group-like halo is not itself in the vicinity of a yet more massive\nhalo.\nFor central halos, an increase in the local density corresponds to an increase in the\nnumber of halos between one and a few rv that are under the influence of the central halo.\nIn contrast, for non-central 'distinct' halos, increasing environment corresponds to increasing\naverage tidal forces. The high Vmax halos are all central halos, but the middle Vmax range\nincludes both central and non-central 'distinct' halos. This is also true for the low Vmax\nhalos, but for these halos 2h\u22121 Mpc is considerably more than a few rv . At z = 2 when\nthe central halos in the middle Vmax range are isolated, the merger rate increases with local\nenvironment. Poor statistics prevent this trend from being measured with clear significance,\nbut the difference between the panels in Figure 8 is suggestive. Such a difference is not\nobserved for lower redshifts, perhaps because it is increasingly more likely for a group-like\nhalo to be in the vicinity of a cluster-like halo even if it is a central halo.\nThis scenario may also provide insight into the evolution of the major merger assembly\nbias. The following discussion applies more generally to any trend that is driven by the\nproximity of a more massive halo. At any redshift, the youngest, most massive, biased halos\nuniversally dominate their local dynamics, corresponding to R\u2212 increasing with local halo\nnumber density. For smaller halos the chances of being in the vicinity of one of these halos\nincreases with environment. While in less dense environments R\u2212 for these smaller halos may\nstill increase with environment, in rich environments it will decline. As time advances and\nthese larger halos become less biased, the smaller halos will find themselves in the vicinity\nof a more massive halo in less extreme environments, resulting in an R\u2212 that decreases with\nenvironment in all environments. As the growth of structure advances further, halos with\nincreasingly higher values of Vmax form, and the halos that were once universally dominant\nfind themselves transitioning into a regime in which R\u2212 declines with environment. In this\npicture, the likelihood of showing a galaxy-like or a group-like correlation between R\u2212 and\nenvironment correlates with the bias of the halos. This discussion is meant only to consider\nthe issues involved and suggest an aspect of this picture that may be rewarding to explore\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nfurther. One general characteristic of this scheme is that the Vmax at which the dependence of\nR\u2212 on environment transitions from group-like to galaxy-like evolves towards higher values\nwith time, which is typical of the assembly biases.\nObserving the trends between R\u2212 and local halo density may be possible either directly or through clustering. It can be predicted that, when cross correlated with a fainter\ngalaxy sample, galaxy populations corresponding to the brightest merger remnants will show\nenhanced clustering on scales larger than the typical virial radius of the remnants. Cross\ncorrelating with a fainter galaxy sample allows the environment on scales of a few virial radii\nto be adequately sampled. Confronting previously identified assembly biases observationally\nis difficult both because the correlation is small and because the relevant halo properties\nmay only loosely correlate with galaxy properties. One exception, the number of subhalos a group hosts, has its own difficulties due to constraints imposed by estimating group\nmasses (Berlind et al. 2006). The major merger rate may therefore be an interesting way to\ndirectly probe the assembly biases as a class.\nThe picture presented here may also contribute to a physical understanding of any\nassembly type bias that is observed. For example, Berlind et al. (2006) find that groups\nwhose central galaxies are bluer than average, or rather less red than average, are biased\non large scales compared to average groups. While bluer galaxies are typically considered\n'younger', blue colors suggest the central galaxy has recently received either gas or young\nstars. This does not correlate in a straight forward way with any of the previously observed\nassembly biases. In contrast, we find not only that major merger remnants are biased, but\nthat for merger remnants in dense environments the average time between subhalo accretion\nand a sub-host merger is reduced. Therefore, sub-host mergers in these environments are\nmore likely to bring young stars, and possibly gas, to the central galaxy.\n\n4.4.\n\nSubhalo Completion\n\nIn order to determine when our results may be impacted by the artificial disruption\nof subhalos, we apply the criteria of Klypin et al. (1999), which were discussed in \u00a72.1, to\nthe relevant subhalos. We begin by determining whether our results are limited by mass\nresolution or force/spatial resolution. For the MS, a tidal radius of two times the spatial\nresolution corresponds to 10h\u22121 kpc. Assuming, for simplicity, a static subhalo density profile,\nmass resolution is the limiting factor for subhalos. That is, for the particle mass and spatial\nresolution of the MS, subhalos drop below the 30 particle limit before their tidal radius\nreaches 10h\u22121 kpc. A typical halo with Vmax = 100km/s, the lowest relevant Vmax , that has\nbeen stripped to the 30 particle limit has a tidal radius significantly larger than 10h\u22121 kpc,\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nso this conclusion likely holds in the realistic case that stripping alters the subhalo density\nprofile. To check this conclusion we follow subhalos in the bound particle number versus\norbital radius plane and find the redshift at which subhalos with Vmax = 120km/s, the lower\nlimit of our catalog, begin dropping below the 30 particle limit. We do not appear to be\nloosing any subhalos before this point. For each of the minimum Vmax values considered\nbelow, the same result applies; the limiting condition is that a typical subhalo retain at\nleast 30 bound particles. When relevant subhalos begin dropping below the 30 particle limit\nbefore reaching orbital radii at which a merger with the host is presumed imminent, subhalo\nretention has become an issue.\nTo estimate if and when subhalos with a given Vmax drop below the 30 particle limit we\nuse the analytical estimate of Mamom (2000) for tidal stripping of NFW halos;\nmts \u2248 mvs ar (ro /rvh )br\nwhere mts /mvs is the tidal mass of the subhalos as a fraction of the initial virial mass,\nro /rvs the orbital radius scaled by the virial radius of the host halo, and ar and br are\nchosen to reflect departures of the halo density profile from self similarity. As can be seen\nin Figure 2, this provides a fair description of tidal stripping in the MS. By using the\ncorrelation measured in the MS between Vmax and bound particle number for distinct halos,\nwe can estimate the r0 /rvh to which a typical halo with a given Vmax retains 30 particles.\nThis relation evolves with redshift and subhalos of a given Vmax are lost at increasing r0 /rvh\nas the redshift increases. The pertinent Vmax are 100 km/s for sub-sub mergers with remnant\nVmax > 175km/s, 120 km/s for subhalo counts, and 210 km/s for sub-host mergers in 'grouplike' halos with Vmax > 380km/s. In the simulation, 90% of the least massive progenitors of\nmajor mergers have Vmax values greater than 0.6 times that of the merger remnant. Hence\nthe values of 100 km/s and 210 km/s. Typical subhalos with Vmax = 210km/s survive\nnumerical effects to ro /rvh = 0.1 out to z > 4. Subhalos with Vmax = 120km/s survive to\nro /rvh < 0.1 at z = 0, ro /rvh \u2248 0.2 at z = 1, and ro /rvh \u2248 0.4 at z = 2. Typical subhalos\nwith Vmax = 100km/s survive to ro /rvh \u2248 0.25 at z = 0 and ro /rvh \u2248 0.5 at z = 1.\nThese estimates show that we are clearly pushing the ability to track subhalos in the\nMS. Most of the important results, however, are quite robust against the effects of subhalo\ncompletion. The largest exception is the case of mergers between subhalos. Subhalo mergers\nare more likely to happen before subhalos are significantly tidally stripped, which mitigates\nthe effects of loosing potential least massive merger progenitors to artificial evaporation at\nmoderate radii. That said, the result that subhalo mergers are rare must rest solely on\nresults from redshifts near z = 0. The most robust result is that the presence of multiple\nsubhalos drastically reduces the time-scale for sub-host mergers. It is the presence of bound\nstructures in the simulation that drives the merger rate. It is therefore appropriate to\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nseparate halos based on the presence or absence of such a structure, regardless of whether\na subhalo would exist in the hypothetical case of better mass resolution. The related result\nthat an assembly-type bias is observed in the major merger rate is somewhat less robust\nas it depends on identifying the particular halos in which subhalos counts and the sub-host\nmerger rate are enhanced. The fidelity of this identification starts fading near z \u2248 1 as\nsubhalos with Vmax \u2248 120km/s begin to be subject to artificial evaporation. In the absence\nof a correlation between environment and the probability of a subhalo evaporating, however,\nthis effect only introduces noise. This may degrade the observed trend but cannot create\nit. To the extent that environment and subhalo loss may be correlated, the initial bound\nparticle counts of fresh subhalos are likely suppressed in over-dense environments, biasing\nagainst the observed result.\nThe evolution of the merger rate for halos with Vmax > 175km/s may be strongly\naffected by subhalo incompletion. Completion affects both the measured evolution of R+\nand R\u2212 in all environments and the comparison between environments. In all environments,\nthe first subhalos lost are not the least massive progenitor halos of the sub-host mergers,\nwhich dominate the merger rate. Rather they are the lower Vmax subhalos which facilitate\nthe sub-host major mergers. These halos are not only missed by the halo finder, they are\ntruly absent having been artificially dissolved. This results in a major merger rate that is\nincreasingly underestimated at high redshifts; an effect that becomes important for galaxylike halos at lower redshifts than group-like halos. In galaxy-like halos a second effect comes\ninto play when the least massive progenitors of sub-host mergers are artificially dissolved,\nresulting in a major merger occurring prematurely. The combination of these effects may\nbe quite complex, yet in Figure 1, the merger rate for all halos shows a smooth evolution.\nSubhalos also play a role in group identification, complicating the comparison of the major\nmerger rate between different environments. As completion begins to affect subhalos with\nVmax \u2248 120km/s, the requirement that a 'group' halo have at least two subhalos becomes\nincreasingly stringent. As some 'real groups' are not identified, the physical density of\nmergers in groups is underestimated at high redshift and the measured slope of the evolution\nis too shallow. The flattening of the physical number density of mergers in group seen in\nFigure 1 is likely in part due to completion. The average number of subhalos in the groups\nalso declines with redshift, which may be real, artificial, or a combination. Note that these\neffects refer only to the evolution of the merger rate in groups. As long as the specific sub-sub\nmerger rate is significantly lower than the sub-host specific merger rate, the specific merger\nrate in groups will be suppressed compared to the merger rate for all halos.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have made a detailed study of the environments of major mergers in the Millennium\nSimulation (Springel et al. 2005a). Our goal in doing so is to provide a theoretical background\nfor observational tests both to confront the dark matter simulations directly and to identify\npopulations of merger remnants through their environments. Comparing simulation results\nwith observations correctly requires some caution. The most robust observational tests rely\non physically motivated comparisons between actual observations. Such tests are likely to be\nremarkably insensitive to the details of the simulation. Comparisons between observations\nthat are motivated by the simulations, but which are not physically motivated may be\ninteresting, but their interpretation will likely be difficult. They may be useful for testing\nthe accuracy of numerical simulations when subtle resolution effects are involved. Finally,\ncomparing simulation results to observations directly is tempting, but perilous. When trying\nto make such a comparison extreme care must be taken to understand sample selection, both\nin the simulations and the observations, and to understand the effects of halo completion,\nwith all subtleties included.\nWe find that the evolution of the specific merger rate, both forward and backwardlooking, is flatter than the evolution of the number density of halos. This comparison can be\nmade directly in the observations and has physical implications because it probes the growth\nof structure. Comparing an observational result to the simulations also has the ability to\nprobe the importance of subhalo completion on the simulated merger rate. In the simulations\nsubhalo completion affects the evolution of the major merger rate but not the evolution of the\nhalo number density. The discrepancy between the two slopes, R and n, is large, however,\nand it is likely the difference cannot be accounted for by completion effects. Comparing the\nslope of the evolution of the merger rate for galaxy samples with different luminosity limits\nmay be another way to probe the effects of completion in the simulation as they become\nincreasingly important for lower Vmax halo samples. In contrast, comparing the measured\nslope of the evolution of the merger rate from the simulations directly to an observed slope\nis unlikely to be rewarding as the simulated evolution is affected by completion, may depend\non halo selection, and such a match would require modeling any evolution of the Vmax luminosity relation.\nSubhalos are quickly tidally stripped after they are accreted by their host unless Vs /Vh \u2248\n1. One simple effect of this is that the cross section for sub-sub mergers is drastically reduced.\nIn the MS this is seen as a specific merger rate for sub-sub mergers that is 20-30 times lower\nthan for sub-host mergers. The specific merger rate among group 'members' is therefore\nsuppressed compared to isolated halos. The mergers in groups are dominated by sub-host\nmergers, but the halo counts are dominated by subhalos. Our first physically motivated\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\nprediction is that the specific major merger rate, that is the merger rate per galaxy, is\nsuppressed in groups. This contrasts with previous predictions based on mass selected subhalos. We caution that the exact specific merger rate measured in the simulated groups\nshould not be compared directly to an observed rate because group selection can have a\nsignificant effect on the measured specific major merger rate.\nTidal stripping dramatically lengthens the time between accretion and the sub-host\nmerger in host halos with a lone subhalo, which was seen both by Boylan-Kolchin et al. (2008)\nand in the extremely low specific major merger rates observed for single subhalo systems\nin the MS. In halos that host multiple subhalos, the merger rate is enhanced by a factor\nof 10. Subhalos experience inelastic collisions (Knebe et al. 2006) during which subhalos\nwith opposing angular momentum may be able to dump energy and angular momentum\nallowing subhalo interactions to facilitate sub-host mergers. Observing the effects of these\ninteractions on the major merger rate is robust to subhalo completion issues as it is driven\nby the presence of bound objects in the simulation. Merger remnants are significantly more\nlikely than the average halo to host a subhalo. The observational consequence of which is\nthat the frequency of faint near-by companions should be enhanced for merger remnants.\nSimilarly, when cross-correlated with a fainter galaxy sample, merger remnants should show\nan enhanced correlation on scales less than the virial radius of the remnants.\nThe major merger rate was found to be uncorrelated with both local environment and\nVmax when each was studied independently. There is no physical motivation for this result,\nand it may not hold down to lower Vmax . At fixed Vmax however we found an assembly type\nbias in the backward looking merger rate. For galaxy-like halos R\u2212 decreases with increasing\ndensity while for group-like halos it increases. A physical mechanism for the major merger\nassembly bias was advanced in \u00a74. Tidal stripping extends beyond the virial radius of central\nhalos and may be responsible for the decrease in the major merger rate of galaxy-like halos\nin dense environments. In contrast, interactions between bound halos in group outskirts\nmay enhance accretion onto group-like halos in dense environments, resulting in a positive\ncorrelation between subhalo counts and local environment (as seen by Wechsler et al. 2006).\nThis correlation would drive an increase in the major merger rate for group-like halos in dense\nenvironments. For assembly biases in general, the typical Vmax or mass at which the cross\nover from galaxy-like to group-like behavior occurs increases with time, which is expected if\nthey are driven by the likelihood of finding a more massive halo in the vicinity. We predict\nthat major merger remnants that are the central galaxies of groups should show enhanced\nclustering on scales beyond the viral radius of the group. Major mergers are a promising\nway of observing an assembly-type bias because the link between halo and galaxy properties\nis straight forward.\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\nThe physically motivated predictions presented above can be used to confront the simulation results with observations, provided that major merger remnants are conservatively\nidentified. We predict that merger remnants should show an excess of faint nearby companions, have enhanced clustering on small scales, and, for the central galaxies of groups,\nalso have enhanced clustering on intermediate and large scales. Using environment to test\nwhether other populations are merger remnants will be complicated by the physics of these\nobjects. Three populations of interest are starbursts, K+A galaxies, and AGN, which are\nall considered possible stages of the evolution of a merger between two blue spiral galaxies\ninto a red elliptical. The correlation between dark matter mergers and these populations\ndepends on the presence of substantial amounts of gas during the merger, which we do not\nattempt to track in the simulation. In the case of mergers between two galaxy-like halos,\none or both of the merging galaxies is likely to have gas. For mergers involving a group-like\nhalo, either merger progenitor may lack gas and the likelihood of the merger involving gas\nmay depend on environment. If the group-like halo hosts a hot inter-group medium, then the\nleast massive progenitor, which generally spends a considerable time orbiting the group prior\nto merging, may be stripped of its gas. Not all group-like halos host an IGM however. The\nlikelihood of a group hosting an IGM correlates with the morphology of the central galaxy,\nwith blue central galaxies corresponding to a lack of an IGM and vice versa (Osmond &\nPonman 2004; Brough et al. 2006). Early type groups, which host an IGM, may reside\nin different environments than the late type groups and hence the likelihood of a merger\ninvolving gas may depend on the local environment.\nGiven the complicating gas physics, studying the frequency of fainter companions has\nclear advantages over clustering studies. When studying small scales, i.e. the one-halo term,\ncross correlations weigh the contribution of each central galaxy by the number of subhalos,\nns. If the likelihood of being able to fuel a starburst or an AGN correlates with ns, then\nobserving an enhanced clustering will depend on the sign and strength of this correlation.\nWhen studying larger scales, the two-halo term, observing the predicted enhancement for\ngroup-like halos requires that gassy major mergers are a fair sample of all major mergers,\nwhich is likely not the case. In contrast, studying the frequency of fainter companions does\nnot require a fair sampling and weights each central halo equally.\nWhen studying the environments of AGN further physics comes into play. AGN display\na complex relationship between host mass or Vmax and AGN luminosity which may depend\non both environment and redshift (Hopkins et al. 2006a,b). The distribution of Vmax for luminous AGN will be different than that of the underlying merger population if the AGN lifetime\ncorrelates with Vmax . This will affect the clustering of these AGN, even in the absence of a\ncorrelation between environment and the merger rate. This will also complicate constructing\na comparison sample for studies of companion frequencies. Determining whether AGN are\n\n\f\u2013 32 \u2013\nmergers may require modeling AGN fueling and attempting to over constrain such models\nwith several observational measures of environment, number density, and evolution. Additionally, some AGN may be triggered by by alternate mechanisms, though merger driven\nAGN likely dominate at high redshift and bright luminosity (Hopkins & Hernquist 2006, and\nreferences therein).\nDesigning specific observational tests based on the results presented here is a topic for\nfuture work.\n\n6.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was partially funded by NSF grant 0707731.

The left hand panel displays the evolution of the\nspecific merger rate, the merger rate per halo, for all halos. The forward looking rate, R+ ,\nand the backward looking rate, R\u2212 are both plotted, where R+ is the fraction of all halos\nwith Vmax > 175km/s that will become the most massive progenitor of a major merger in\nthe next Gyr and R\u2212 the fraction of all halos with Vmax > 175km/s that are a remnant of\na major merger that occurred in the last Gyr. These two definitions correspond to merger\nrates determined using counts of close pairs and morphologically identified merger remnants\nrespectively. The right hand panel displays the physical number density of major mergers per\nGyr resulting in remnants with Vmax > 175km/s. The red solid line corresponds to all halos.\nThe blue and purple lines correspond to mergers occurring in 'groups' and 'rich groups'\n(See the text for group halo definitions). The solid lines include both mergers between two\nsubhalos and mergers between a subhalo and the host halo. The dashed lines include only\nmergers between two subhalos.\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Tidal stripping of subhalos at z=0. Logarithmically spaced contours of subhalo\nnumber density in the log[np/np(Vmax )] versus log(ro /rvh ) plane, where np/np(Vmax ) is a well\ndefined surrogate for mts /mvs , as discussed in the text, and ro /rvh is the subhalo's distance\nfrom the center of the host halo in units of the host halo's virial radius. In the three different\npanels, contours are shown for subhalos residing in hosts with Vh values corresponding to\ngalaxy-like host halos, group-like host halos, and rich group and cluster-like host halos. The\nblack contours are for all subhalos with Vs > 120km/s. The colored contours are for subhalos\nwhose merger with the host would be counted as a major merger. Contours are shown for\nVs /Vh > 0.7 and Vs /Vh > 0.94, roughly corresponding to pre-tidal stripping mass ratios of 1:3\nand 1:1.2. With the exception of some subhalos with high Vs /Vh , all subhalos are similarly\ntidally stripped. The thin diagonal lines show the predicted relationships between mts /mvs\nand rp /rvh for NFW halos for group-like (center panel) and cluster-like (right panel) hosts\nfrom Mamom (2000), where rp is the peri-center of the subhalo's orbit. The right-hand line\nhas been shifted to higher ro /rvh by 0.3.\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Tidal stripping of subhalos at z=1. The same as Figure 2, but for z = 1.\n\nFig. 4.- Distribution of VLMP /VMMP for major mergers at z = 0, 1, and 2. The three panels\nshow the distribution split by merger remnant Vmax . The same ranges are used as in Figures 2\nand 3. The solid lines are histograms of the fraction of major mergers in each VLMP /VMMP\nbin and the dashed lines are the cumulative probability distribution of VLMP /VMMP values.\nMergers are heavily dominated by lower values of VLMP /VMMP , and it is safe to assume that\nthe vast majority of major mergers are true sub-host mergers in which the subhalo merger\npartner has been tidally stripped before completely merging with the host halo.\n\n\f\u2013 36 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- The effect of interactions between subhalos on the major merger rate. The left\npanel shows R+ for sub-host mergers in hosts with 345 < Vh (km/s) < 455 split by the number\nof subhalos in the host. The dark blue long-dashed line shows R+ for mergers between a\nhost and a lone subhalo. The light blue dot-dashed line shows R+ for sub-host mergers of\nhosts with two subhalos, and the green dotted line shows R+ for sub-host mergers of hosts\nwith at least two subhalos. Introducing a second subhalo increases R+ by a factor of \u2248 10,\nrather than \u2248 2, as would be expected if interactions between subhalos had no effect on the\nmerger rate. The right panel demonstrates how this is reflected in the relationship between\nthe number of subhalos and the frequency of merger remnants for halos with group-like\nVmax . The dark blue dashed line shows the merger remnant frequency for halos with no\nsubhalos with Vs > 120km/s. These remnants would be the result of mergers between the\nhost and a single bright subhalo. The green line shows the frequency of merger remnants\namong group-like halos with at least one bright subhalo and the red line shows the frequency\namong all group-like halos. Merger remnants should be more likely than average galaxies\nto have a least one fainter close companion and should show enhanced correlations on small\nscales when cross correlated with a fainter galaxy sample.\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- The evolution of the specific major merger rate, R\u2212 , for 'group' and 'rich group'\nmembers is compared to that for all halos. Groups and rich groups are defined in the\ntext. 'Members' includes both the central host halo and its subhalos. Contrary to previous\nexpectations, the specific merger rate in groups is lower than in the field.\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- Merger rate versus local halo number density and Vmax . The left panel displays R\u2212\nversus the local halo number density, measured by counting all halos with Vmax > 120km/s\nwithin a 2h\u22121 Mpc comoving sphere, for all halos with Vmax > 175km/s for z = 0, 1, and\n2. The right panel shows R\u2212 versus Vmax for halos in all environments. Insets are for\norientation. The left inset shows the distribution of local densities for z = 1 for three Vmax\nranges, galaxy-like (175 < Vmax (km/s) < 380), group-like (380 < Vmax (km/s) < 500), and\nrich group-like (500 < Vmax (km/s) < 950). This inset clearly illustrates halo biasing. The\nright inset shows the distribution of Vmax in three environment ranges, 0-4, 5-9, and 10-14\nhalos within 2h\u22121 Mpc comoving, displaying the counterpart of halo biasing. The merger\nrate is independent of Vmax and, for environments typical of most halos, of environment.\n\n\f\u2013 39 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- Merger rate versus local halo number density for halos grouped by Vmax . In both\npanels, R\u2212 is plotted versus the local density at z = 0, 1, and 2 for halos in three Vmax\nranges. The middle Vmax range, the green dotted line, evolves from moderately biased at\nz = 2 to unbiased at z = 0. The left panel includes both central halos and non-central\nhalos that are beyond the virial radius of the central halo of their dark matter FOF group.\nIn this panel, the major merger rate shows an assembly-type bias with R\u2212 decreasing with\nlocal density for halos with low Vmax and increasing with local density for halos with high\nVmax . The right panel includes only halos that are the central halo of their dark matter FOF\ngroup, excluding 'distinct' halos on the outskirts of more massive halos. For halos with low\nVmax , R\u2212 is observed to decrease with local density in the right panel, but not in the left.\nThe left panel is sensitive to the effects of a massive host halo on nearby distinct halos while\nthe right panel is sensitive to the effect of the local environment on halos that dominate\ntheir immediate surroundings. Comparing the two panels provides insight into the possible\nphysical mechanisms responsible for the major merger assembly bias\n\n\f\u2013 40 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nAlexander, D. M., Bauer, F.
