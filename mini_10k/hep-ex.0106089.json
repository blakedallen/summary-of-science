Introduction\nSince the discovery of the electron neutrino in 19551, the study of neutrino physics\nhas often led to great progress in the unravelling of sub-nuclear phenomena. However, although they have been used as powerful probes of elementary particles interactions, very little is known about the general properties of neutrinos: we know\nneither their mass, nor their magnetic moment; we don't know whether they are\nDirac or Majorana particles; we don't know how many neutrino species exist in\nnature. In many respects, neutrinos perhaps remain the most intriguing mystery in\nparticle physics.\nIn more recent years most of the research activity in neutrino physics has focused on the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations, originally postulated by Bruno\nPontecorvo.2 Interest in this field has been revived by several very interesting experimental results, which in some cases very strongly support the hypothesis of neutrino\noscillations. This is only possible if, contrary to what assumed in the Standard\nModel of electro-weak interactions, neutrinos have non-zero and non-degenerate\nmasses. Thus, evidence for neutrino oscillations would represent a major discovery\nin elementary particle physics and would then require a complete revolution in our\nunderstanding of the natural world.\nThis is a very exciting time for neutrino physics, with new data becoming available in a relatively short period of time. Whilst this paper was being completed,\nthe long-awaited first results from the SNO experiment were presented.3 We hope\nthat many others will follow, from all the running or planned experiments, and that\nmore data will soon lead to the solution of this fascinating puzzle of particle physics.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nIn this paper, after a brief introduction to massive neutrinos and to the formalism\nof neutrino oscillations, the latest experimental results will be reviewed. The focus\nwill be on those experiments which have added pieces of information to the current\npicture of neutrino oscillation phenomenology, either by observing a signal or by\nsetting a limit in an interesting portion of the relevant parameter space. Planned\nexperiments, designed to resolve some of the as yet unsolved ambiguities, will also\nbe described.\n2. Neutrino Masses\nThe present experimental limits on neutrino masses, as obtained from direct\nkinematic searches, under the assumption that flavour and mass eigenstates are\nessentially coincident, are the following :4,5,6,7\nm\u03bde < 2.2 eV\nm\u03bd\u03bc < 170 keV\nm\u03bd\u03c4 < 15.5 MeV\n\n(95% C.L., from 3 H \u21923 He + e\u2212 + \u03bd\u0304e );\n(90% C.L., from \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc+ + \u03bd\u03bc )\n\n(1)\n\n0\n\n(95% C.L., from \u03c4 \u2192 5\u03c0(\u03c0 ) + \u03bd\u03c4 ) .\n\nAlthough the smallness of these limits might lead to the naive conclusion that\nneutrino masses are exactly vanishing, there is no theoretical reason to assume that\nthis is indeed the case. On the contrary, it is generally believed that particle masses\ncan be identically equal to zero only if they are associated with an exact gauge\nsymmetry. This is not true for the lepton quantum number, which is then expected\nnot to be conserved.\nPerhaps the most popular expression for the neutrino mass term is the one\nassociated with the so-called see-saw8 form of the mass matrix. In the simple case\nof one generation this mass term is given by:\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001 0\n\u03bdL\nmD\n\u03bdL , \u03bdR\n,\n(2)\n\u03bdR\nmD M M\n\nwhere a right-handed neutrino singlet, \u03bdR , has been introduced. Assuming that the\nDirac mass mD is much smaller than the Majorana mass MM a, the diagonalisation\nof (2) gives a heavy eigenstate, of mass \u223c MM , and a light eigenstate, which can\nbe identified with the standard left-handed neutrino and whose mass is given by:\nm\u03bd \u2243\n\nm2D\n.\nMM\n\n(3)\n\nIf the Dirac mass is of the same order as that of a fundamental fermion, be\nit a quark or a charged lepton (mD \u223c O(mq,l )), and if MM \u223c O(MGUT ), then\nthe neutrino mass turns out to be naturally very small, and in a range of values\ncompatible with those indicated by experimental results.\nain\n\nthe generic n\u2212generation case mD and MM are n \u00d7 n matrices: then mD \u226a MD means that\nall eigenvalues of mD are small compared to all eigenvalues of MM .\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n3\n\nSeveral versions of the see-saw mechanism are considered in literature.9 Among\nthem, the so-called quadratic see-saw, in which all the Majorana masses are similar\nto each other, and therefore the light neutrino masses scale as the Dirac masses\nsquared:\nm\u03bd1 : m\u03bd2 : m\u03bd3 \u2243 m2q1 , l1 : m2q2 , l2 : m2q3 , l3\n\n(4)\n\nAnother possibility is the linear see-saw, where MM \u221d mD and then:\nm\u03bd1 : m\u03bd2 : m\u03bd3 \u2243 mq1 , l1 : mq2 , l2 : mq3 , l3 ,\n\n(5)\n\nBoth versions imply a hierarchy between the light neutrino mass eigenstates:\nm\u03bd1 \u226a m\u03bd2 \u226a m\u03bd3 .\n\n(6)\n\n3. Neutrino Oscillations in Vacuum\nOrdinary neutrinos are produced in weak processes together with their charged\npartner leptons (W + \u2192 l+ \u03bdl ), as for example in pion decays or in nuclear beta\ndecays, and they are therefore eigenstates of the weak interactions. On the other\nhand, weak interaction eigenstates and mass eigenstates are not necessarily coincident. With a change of basis, neutrinos produced as flavour eigenstates can be\nrepresented as a coherent linear superposition of the mass eigenstates:\nX\n\u2217\nU\u03b1i\n| \u03bdi i\n(\u03b1 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 )\n(7)\n| \u03bd\u03b1 i =\ni\n\nwhere i runs over all the existing mass eigenstates and U\u03b1i are the elements of a\nunitary matrix.b\nAlthough from measurements of the Z 0 width at LEP we know that the number\nof light active neutrinos is N\u03bd = 2.994\u00b10.012 6 , nothing forbids the existence of more\nthan three neutrinos of definite mass. If, for example, there were four independent\nmass eigenstates, a change of basis from the mass to the flavour eigenstates would\nnecessarily lead to one linear combination,\nX\n| \u03bds i =\nUsi\u2217 | \u03bdi i ,\n(8)\ni\n\nwhich has no normal weak coupling. The linear combination (8) is therefore referred\nto as a \"sterile neutrino\", as opposed to the standard \"active\" neutrino.\nAs we shall see in the next sections, the existence of at least one sterile neutrino\nmight be the only way to accommodate all the experimental results on neutrino\noscillations. Nonetheless, for the sake of simplicity, in the following discussion\nwe will only consider the three neutrino flavours whose existence has been firmly\nb\n\nThe convention of using Greeks letters to identify flavour eigenstates and Latin letters to identify\nmass eigenstatates has been adopted throughout this paper.\n\n\f4\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nestablished.c However, it must be noted that the same formalism would be valid for\nany number of neutrinos.\nAfter a neutrino has been prepared in the state | \u03bd\u03b1 i at t = 0, each of its\ncomponents will evolve according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. At a time t after\nproduction it will be:\n| \u03bd\u03b1 (t > 0)i =\n\nX\ni\n\n\u2217\ne\u2212iEi t U\u03b1i\n| \u03bdi i =\n\nXX\ni\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u2217\nU\u03b2i e\u2212iEi t U\u03b1i\n| \u03bdi i ,\n\n(9)\n\nThus, after the neutrino produced in the flavour eigenstate \u03b1 has travelled a\ndistance L \u2243 t, the probability of finding it in a different flavour state \u03b2 is non-zero\nand is given by:\nP(\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 ) = |h \u03bd\u03b2 (t)| \u03bd\u03b1 i|2 =\n\nP\n\ni\n\n\u2217\nU\u03b2i e\u2212iEi t U\u03b1i\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nUsing the unitarity condition for U , after some algebra the probability (10) takes\nthe following oscillatory form:\nP(\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 ) =\n\nX\ni\n\n|U\u03b2i |2 |U\u03b1i |2 + 2Re\n\n\u0010\n\u2206m2jk L \u0011\n\u2217\n\u2217\nU\u03b2i U\u03b2j\nU\u03b1i\nU\u03b1j exp \u2212 i\n,\n2E\nj>i\n(11)\n\nX\n\nwhere \u2206m2ij = |m2i \u2212m2j | and the ultra-relativistic expansion for the neutrino energy\nhas been used.d Thus the transition probability P(\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 ) depends on a combination of the mixing matrix elements, on the squared difference between the mass\neigenvalues of the mass eigenstates, and on two parameters, the neutrino energy E\nand the distance L between the production and the observation points, which are\ndetermined by the experimental conditions.\nAlthough from the simplicity of the preceding discussion it might seem that\nneutrino oscillations can be obtained as a straightforward consequence of elementary\nquantum mechanics, a rigorous treatment of the problem would require that a wave\npacket formalism be considered. We shall not discuss this approach here and the\ninterested reader is remanded, for example, to ref.11 and refs. therein.\nThe lepton mixing matrix U , also known as the Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (MNS)\nmatrix,12 is the leptonic analogue of the CKM matrix for the quark sector. In the\ncase of three neutrino flavours the explicit relation between the flavour and the mass\neigenstates is given by:\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\nUe1\n\u03bde\n\uf8ed\u03bd\u03bc \uf8f8 = \uf8edU\u03bc1\nU\u03c4 1\n\u03bd\u03c4\n\uf8eb\nc the\n\nUe2\nU\u03bc2\nU\u03c4 2\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\u03bd1\nUe3\nU\u03bc3 \uf8f8 \uf8ed\u03bd2 \uf8f8 .\n\u03bd3\nU\u03c4 3\n\n(12)\n\nexistence of the \u03c4 neutrino, of which only indirect evidence was available until very recent\n10\ntimes, has\nq been proven by the emulsion-based DONUT experiment, at Fermilab.\n2\n2\nd E =\n2\np2 + mi \u2243 p + mi /2p \u2243 p + mi /2E.\ni\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n5\n\nIt is sometimes convenient to parametrize U in a form analogous to that of the\nCKM matrix,6 which for Dirac neutrinos is:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nc12 c13\ns12 c13\ns13 e\u2212i\u03b4\nU = \uf8ed\u2212s12 c23 \u2212 c12 s23 s13 ei\u03b4 c12 c23 \u2212 s12 s23 s13 ei\u03b4\ns23 c13 \uf8f8 ,\n(13)\ns12 s23 \u2212 c12 c23 s13 ei\u03b4 \u2212c12 s23 \u2212 s12 c23 s13 ei\u03b4 c23 c13\n\nwith the standard convention cij = cos \u03b8ij and sij = sin \u03b8ij (i, j = 1, 2, 3 are the\ngeneration labels). Thus in this formalism the mixing matrix depends only on three\nmixing angles, \u03b812 , \u03b813 and \u03b823 , and a CP-violating phase, \u03b4.e\nAlthough the most general description of the mixing among all neutrinos implies\nthe three-flavour treatment, most experimental results are expressed in the two\ngeneration mixing representation. More recent analyses, however, generally attempt\na global fit to all data assuming three-flavour mixing.\nIn the case of transitions between two flavours the mixing matrix has the form\nof a rotation in a two-dimensional space:\n\u0012\n\u0013\ncos \u03b8 sin \u03b8\nU=\n,\n(14)\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\nwhere \u03b8 is the mixing angle, analogous to the Cabibbo angle for the quarks. The\nrelation between the flavour and the mass eigenstate is then given by\n| \u03bd\u03b1 i =\n| \u03bd\u03b2 i =\n\ncos \u03b8 | \u03bd1 i\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 | \u03bd1 i\n\n+ sin \u03b8 | \u03bd2 i\n.\n+ cos \u03b8 | \u03bd2 i\n\n(15)\n\nThe oscillation probability in this case can be written as follows:\n\u0010 L \u0011\nP(\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 ) = sin2 2\u03b8 sin2 \u03c0\n\u03bbosc\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03bbosc is the oscillation wavelength, defined as:\n\u03bbosc =\n\n4\u03c0E\n,\n\u2206m2\n\n(17)\n\nwhere E is again the neutrino energy and \u2206m2 is the squared neutrino mass difference.\nSubstituting the expression of \u03bbosc in (16), the oscillation probability takes its\nusual form:\n!\n2\n1.27\n\u2206m\nL\nP(\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 ) = sin2 2\u03b8 sin2\n,\n(18)\nE\nwhere \u2206m2 is expressed in eV2 , the detector-to-source distance L is in meters (km)\nand the neutrino energy E in MeV (GeV).\ne in\n\nthe case of Majorana neutrinos there would be two additional phases.\n\n\f6\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nThe oscillation probability (18) is the product of two factors. The first one,\nsin 2\u03b8, does not depend on the experimental conditions, but is an intrinsic parameter which describes the strength of the coupling between the two neutrino flavour; it\ngives the maximum amplitude of the neutrino oscillations. The mixing is maximal\nwhen sin2 2\u03b8 = 1, namely when \u03b8 = \u03c0/4.\nThe second factor is another oscillatory term, the period of which is determined\nby \u2206m2 L/E. In order to have sensitivity to small values of \u2206m2 , the ratio E/L\nmust be also small. This can be achieved by having low energy neutrino beams and\nlarge distances between the neutrino source and the detector. On the other hand,\nwhen the oscillation phase becomes too large, that is to say when E/L is too small\ncompared to \u2206m2 , the oscillations occur very rapidly and, due to the finite energy\nresolution of the experiments, the term sin2 (1.27 \u2206m2 L/E) averages to 1/2.\nBefore concluding this overview of the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations\nin vacuum, it is interesting to consider the effect of the CPT, CP and T symmetries\non the oscillation probabilities. Without entering in any details, we shall only say\nthat for both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos, CPT invariance implies:\n2\n\nP(\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 ) = P(\u03bd\u0304\u03b2 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03b1 )\n\n(CPT conserved).\n\n(19)\n\nIn particular, this means that the neutrino and the antineutrino survival probabilities are the same:\nP(\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b1 ) = P(\u03bd\u0304\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03b1 )\n\n(CPT conserved).\n\n(20)\n\nOn the other hand, the oscillation probabilities for neutrinos and antineutrinos\nare generally different. They coincide only if CP, the symmetry which converts a\nleft-handed neutrino into a right-handed antineutrino, is conserved:\nP(\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 ) = P(\u03bd\u0304\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03b2 )\n\n(CP conserved).\n\n(21)\n\nFinally, if the time-reversal symmetry T is conserved, the oscillation probability\nis invariant under interchange of the initial and the final states:\nP(\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 ) = P(\u03bd\u03b2 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b1 )\n\n(T conserved).\n\n(22)\n\n4. Neutrino Oscillations in Matter\nIn the previous section we have seen that the probability for neutrino oscillations\nin vacuum cannot exceed sin2 2\u03b8, \u03b8 being the mixing angle in vacuum between\nthe two flavours under consideration. On the contrary, the situation can be very\ndifferent for neutrino oscillations in matter. Matter effects can greatly enhance\nneutrino mixing, resulting in a large oscillation probability even for very small\nvacuum mixing angles.\nWhen they travel through matter, neutrinos of all flavours can have neutralcurrent interactions with the protons, neutrons and electrons of the medium. However only electron neutrinos can interact with the electrons, undergoing a coherent\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n7\n\nforward scattering via a W boson exchange. The consequence of this asymmetry\nbetween neutrino flavours is known as the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW)\neffect.13,14\nAt low neutrino energies, for electron, muon and tau neutrinos traversing an electrically neutral and unpolarised medium, the matter-induced potentials are given\nby:\n\u0010\n\u221a\nNn \u0011\nVe = 2GF Ne \u2212\n2\n(23)\n\u221a\nNn\nV\u03bc = V\u03c4 = \u2212 2GF\n,\n2\nwhere GF is the Fermi constant and Ne and Nn are the electron and the neutron\nnumber densities respectively. For antineutrinos the potentials have opposite signs.\nFor simplicity, the discussion will be restricted to the two-flavour scenario, more\nspecifically to the mixing between \u03bde and \u03bd\u03bc . In this case, using the ultra-relativistic\nexpansion for the neutrino energy and neglecting all common phases (which would\nnot affect the result for mixing between active neutrinos), the time evolution for\nthe flavour eigenstates is given by:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u221a\n\u2206m2\n\u2206m2\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u2212\n2G\ncos\n2\u03b8\n+\nsin\n2\u03b8\nN\nF\ne\nd \u03bde\n\uf8f7 \u03bde\n\uf8ec\n4E\n,\n(24)\n= \uf8ed 4E\ni\n\uf8f8 \u03bd\n\u2206m2\n\u2206m2\ndt \u03bd\u03bc\n\u03bc\nsin 2\u03b8\ncos 2\u03b8\n4E\n4E\nwhere the common term due to neutral-current interactions, proportional to the\nidentity matrix, has been ignored.\nThe simplest case of matter distribution is that of constant matter density, Ne =\nconst. Although not very realistic, this is however quite an instructive example and\nwe shall discuss it here in some detail.\nAs for the mass and flavour eigenstates for oscillations in vacuum, the mass and\nflavour eigenstates in matter are also connected by a two-dimensional rotation. The\nrelation between the two bases is given by:\n| \u03bd1M i =\n| \u03bd2M i =\n\ncos \u03b8M | \u03bde i +\n\u2212 sin \u03b8M | \u03bde i +\n\nsin \u03b8M | \u03bd\u03bc i\ncos \u03b8M | \u03bd\u03bc i .\n\n(25)\n\nThe vacuum mixing angle, \u03b8, has been replaced by the mixing angle in matter, \u03b8M ,\ngiven by:\n\n2\n\nsin 2\u03b8M\n\n\u0010 \u2206m2 \u00112\n\nsin2 2\u03b8\n=\u0010\n.\n\u00112 \u0010 \u2206m2 \u00112\n\u221a\n\u2206m2\nsin2 2\u03b8\ncos 2\u03b8 \u2212 2GF Ne +\n2E\n2E\n2E\n\n(26)\n\nIt has to be noticed that, since the mixing angle is not the same as in vacuum, the\nmatter eigenstates | \u03bd1M i and | \u03bd2M i are not coincident with the mass eigenstates in\nvacuum, | \u03bd1 i and | \u03bd2 i.\n\n\f8\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nThe oscillation probability is of the same form as in Eq.(16), but the vacuum\nmixing angle and the vacuum oscillation wavelength are now replaced by those in\nmatter:\n\u0010 L \u0011\nP(\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc ) = sin2 2\u03b8M sin2 \u03c0\n,\n(27)\n\u03bbM\n\nwith \u03bbM given by:\n\n2\u03c0\n.\n\u00112 \u0010 \u2206m2 \u00112\n\u221a\n2\ncos 2\u03b8 \u2212 2GF Ne +\nsin 2\u03b8\n2E\n2E\n\n\u03bbM = r\u0010\n\u2206m2\n\n(28)\n\nFrom Eq.(26) it follows that, regardless of the smallness of the mixing angle\nin vacuum, the mixing angle in matter can be very large. In particular, maximal\nmixing can be achieved if the medium density is such that the following condition\nis satisfied:\n\u221a\n\u2206m2\ncos 2\u03b8 .\n2 GF Ne =\n2E\n\n(29)\n\nThis is the the so-called MSW resonance condition. Using the characteristic solar\nelectron density, Ne \u223c 1026 cm\u22123 , and the characteristic value for solar neutrino\nenergies, E \u223c 1 MeV, assuming small mixing in vacuum (hence cos 2\u03b8 \u223c 1), one\nobtains \u2206m2 \u223c 10\u22125 eV2 .\nSince Ne > 0, Eq.(29) is fulfilled only if \u2206m2 cos \u03b8 > 0. Once a convention on\nthe phase has been chosen, Eq.(29) implies that resonant oscillation enhancement\nis possible only for one particular sign of \u2206m2 . For example, if cos \u03b8 > 0, neutrino\noscillations are enhanced if \u2206m2 = m22 \u2212 m21 > 0. On the other hand, from the\nchange of sign in the matter-induced potentials, it follows that for antineutrinos the\nresonance condition would require \u2206m2 < 0. This means that, for a given sign of\n\u2206m2 , matter effects cannot enhance neutrino and antineutrino oscillations at the\nsame time: if neutrino oscillations are enhanced, antineutrino oscillations will be\nsuppressed, and vice-versa.\nThe evolution equation (24) cannot be solved analytically for any non-uniform\nmatter distribution. In general a numerical solution of the system of differential\nequations (24) has to be computed, accounting for the density profile and the neutrino energy distribution. An interesting case to consider is the so-called adiabatic\napproximation for matter density monotonically decreasing along the neutrino path.\nWithout entering into the details of the calculation, we shall only qualitatively discuss the results for the case of two-flavour neutrino mixing (for example between \u03bde\nand \u03bd\u03bc ), which is useful to describe neutrino oscillations in the Sun.\nElectron neutrinos produced in the core of the Sun, where the density is well\nabove that corresponding to the MSW resonance, will initially see a mixing angle\n\u03b8core \u2248 \u03c0/2. From Eq.(25) it follows that, at production point, a neutrino born as a\n\u03bde will essentially coincide with one of the matter eigenstates \u03bd2M . The adiabaticity\ncondition, that requires slowly changing matter distribution, guarantees that the\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n9\n\nneutrino system can gradually adjust to the changing density of the environment\nand therefore the system will not make any transition to the other matter eigenstate.\nAs \u03bd2M propagates through the mantle, it encounters regions of smaller densities:\nthe effective mixing angle decreases and the strength of the mixing increases, until\nthe resonance condition is fulfilled and maximal mixing is reached. As the neutrino\ntravels further, the mixing angle becomes smaller and smaller, approaching the\nvalue of the mixing angle in vacuum, \u03b8. If \u03b8 is very small, the \u03bde component of \u03bd2M\nis very small at the final point and \u03bd2M is mainly composed of \u03bd\u03bc . The survival and\nthe oscillation probabilities for electron neutrinos are given by:\nP(\u03bde \u2192 \u03bde ) =\nP(\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc ) =\n\nsin2 \u03b8\ncos2 \u03b8 .\n\n(30)\n\nThus, in the range of validity of the adiabatic approximation and for small values\nof the mixing angle in vacuum, if the depth of the traversed matter is large enough,\nthe probability of finding the neutrino in the flavour state \u03bde when it gets outside\nthe Sun is tiny and a complete conversion of \u03bde to \u03bd\u03bc is possible.\nAt this point it becomes natural to discuss the solar neutrino deficit and to\npresent the status of the search for neutrino oscillations in the Sun.\n5. The Solar Neutrino Problem\n5.1. Solar Models\nHistorically the first hint for neutrino oscillations came from the observation of\nneutrinos from the Sun. In 1968 Ray Davis and his collaborators published the first\nresults of the Homestake chlorine experiment,15,16 showing that the measured flux\nof solar electron neutrinos was significantly lower than the expected value. This\nwas the beginning of the solar neutrino deficit saga.\nThe Homestake results were later confirmed by four other experiments: SAGE,17\nGALLEX,18 Kamiokande,19 and Super-Kamiokande.20 Both SAGE and GALLEX\nare radiochemical experiments, like Homestake, while Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande are water-Cherenkov experiments. Before we discuss them, it is important\nto introduce the so-called Standard Solar Model (SSM), used to predict the solar\nneutrino flux under the assumption that no exotic phenomena, such as neutrino\noscillations, can affect the nature of the produced neutrinos before they reach the\nEarth.\nOur Sun belongs to the category of the main sequence stars, which produce\nenergy in their interiors via thermonuclear reactions. The two reaction chains responsible for the energy production are known as the pp-cycle and the CNO-cycle.\nFor both cycles the overall result is the fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium, with\nthe emission of electron neutrinos:\n4p + 2e\u2212 \u21924 He + 2\u03bde + 26.73 MeV .\n\n(31)\n\n\f10\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nOnly \u223c 2% of the solar energy is emitted in the form of neutrinos, while the rest is\nradiated through photons.\nIn the three decades since the first experimental results on solar neutrinos, there\nhas been a flourishing of solar models, all of which use the present values of some\nfundamental solar parameters (such as radius, mass, luminosity, He/H ratio) as\nconstraints on the stellar evolution. They all make essentially the same assumptions\non the nature of the solar energy and of the solar energy transfer mechanism. The\nmost famous and accredited model is certainly that of Bahcall-Pinsonneault (BP\nSSM).21 In the following we shall be referring to its two most recent versions, the\nBP9822 and BP2000,23 in terms of which most published experimental results are\ninterpreted. All reactions belonging to the pp and the CNO cycles, together with\nthe corresponding average and maximum neutrino energies are listed in Tab.1 (from\nref.24 ). The CNO cycle contributes less than 2% to the total neutrino flux.\nTable 1.

The\nuncertainties on the neutrino absorption cross sections represent the dominant contribution to the error on the gallium rate predictions, while for the chlorine rate\nthose uncertainties are relatively small compared to other systematic components\nintrinsic to the experimental technique. The rates are measured in Solar Neutrino\nUnits (SNU), a convenient unit to describe the rates of solar neutrino experiments\n(1 SNU = 10\u221236 events atoms\u22121 s\u22121 ).\nThe energy spectra of neutrinos from the pp-cycle are shown in Fig.1 (BP2000\npredictions, from ref.25 ). The uncertainties on the different flux components are\nalso shown and the energy thresholds of the different experiments are indicated at\nthe top of the plot.\nThere are several reasons, other than the high precision of the input data and\ncalculations, why the BP SSM is believed to be robust. First of all, there is what\nis known as the \"luminosity constraint\" argument. It assumes that the Sun is in\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n11\n\nFig. 1.

From Eq.(31) we see that, in the nuclear reactions occurring in the Sun,\nthe production of two neutrinos is accompanied by an energy release of 26.73 MeV.\nNeglecting the small amount of energy carried away by the neutrinos, this means\nthat the electron neutrino flux in the absence of oscillations can be estimated as\n\u03a6\u03bde \u2243 2 \u00d7\n\n2\nL\u2299 /(4\u03c0R\u2299\n)\n= 6.4 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ,\n26.73 MeV\n\n(32)\n\nwhere R\u2299 is one astronomical unit (= 1.496 \u00d7 1013 cm).\nAnother model-independent constraint, although looser than the luminosity one,\nis given by the fact that the helium nuclei, necessary for the boron and beryllium\nproduction, are created in the pp and pep reactions. Thus:\n\u03a6\u03bde (7 Be) + \u03a6\u03bde (8 B) < \u03a6\u03bde (pp) + \u03a6\u03bde (pep) .\n\n(33)\n\nOne the most impressive checks of the BP SSM come perhaps from the comparison between the BP98 model predictions, obtained without any adjustment of\nthe parameters, and the most accurate helioseismology measurements of the sound\nspeed.26 Fig.2 shows the excellent agreement between the calculated and the measured values: the size of the fractional difference between measurements and predictions (0.001 standard deviation for radii between 5% and 95% of the Sun radius) is\nmuch smaller than any generic change in the model with an impact on the predicted\nneutrino flux.\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n13\n\n5.2. Experimental Results\nWe shall now describe the experimental techniques which have been used to detect solar neutrinos. The experiments can be subdivided into two categories: radiochemical experiments (Homestake, SAGE, GALLEX and its successor, the GNO27\nproject) and water-Cherenkov experiments (Kamiokande, Super-Kamiokande and\nSNO). One of the main differences between these two categories is the fact that,\nwhile for radiochemical experiments only an integrated measurement of the fluxes is\npossible, water-Cherenkov detectors can perform real-time measurements and therefore can study differential distributions (i.e. energy spectrum, angular distribution,\ncorrelation with the Sun position in the sky).\nThe Homestake15,16 chlorine experiment is located 1480 m underground (4200\nm.w.e., meters water equivalent), at the Homestake gold mine, Lead, South Dakota,\nUSA. A tank of 6 \u00d7 105 litres volume is filled with tetrachlorethylene (C2 Cl4 ). The\ndetection principle is based on the reaction:\n\u03bde +37 Cl \u2192 e\u2212 + 37 Ar(T1/2 = 35 d) ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhich has a threshold of 814 keV, above the end-point of the pp-cycle energy spectrum. After an exposure time of 1 \u2212 3 months, the 37 Ar atoms produced in (34)\nare extracted by purging the detector with 4 He and detecting the Auger electron\nproduced in the electron capture of the radioactive 37 Ar nuclei. The measured\nrate, which mainly arises from of 8 B and 7 Be neutrinos, plus a small contribution\nfrom pep neutrinos, is 2.56 \u00b1 0.23 SNU,16 significantly below the predicted value\nof 7.6+1.3\n\u22121.1 SNU. Although the Homestake detector is not calibrated, for lack of a\nsuitable artificial neutrino source, the efficiency of the extraction technique has been\nchecked by doping the detector with a known amount of radioactive argon atoms.\nAll gallium experiments, SAGE,17 GALLEX18 and GNO,27 detect neutrinos\nfrom the Sun by means of the process:\n\u03bde +71 Ga \u2192 e\u2212 +71 Ge(T1/2 = 11.43d) ,\n\n(35)\n\nfor which the energy threshold (233.2 keV) is well below the maximum energy of\nthe pp neutrinos. This means that gallium experiments, by measuring low-energy\nsolar neutrinos, have the ability to prove the thermonuclear nature of the energy\nproduction mechanism in the Sun.\nThe GALLEX experiment, now discontinued as such, was located at the Gran\nSasso Underground Laboratory (LNGS), Assergi, Italy. It consisted of 30.3 tons of\n71\nGa, in the form of a concentrated solution of gallium chloride (GaCl3 \u2212 HCl) in\nwater. The 71 Ge atoms form the volatile compound GeCl4 which, at the end of\neach run (3 \u2212 4 weeks) is swept out of the solution by means of a nitrogen stream.\nThe GeCl4 is absorbed in water in a gas scrubber, where the nitrogen is filtered out,\nand then converted to GeH4 . This compound is finally introduced, together with\nxenon, into a proportional counter where the number of 71 Ga atoms is determined\nby counting the radioactive decays. The final results from GALLEX(I-IV)18 give\n\n\f14\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\na solar neutrino flux of 77.5+7.6\n\u22127.8 SNU, again well below theoretical predictions of\n+9\n128\u22127 SNU. The GALLEX detector was calibrated using two independent methods.\nThe first one made use of neutrinos from two intense (> 60 PBq) 51 Cr sources: the\ncombined value of the ratio R between the neutrino source strength as derived from\nthe measured rate of 71 Ga production and the directly determined source strength\nis R = 0.93 \u00b1 0.08.28 The other calibration was performed by injecting, under varying conditions, a known amount of 71 As into the full-scale detector.29 The arsenic\nisotope decays by electron capture and positron emission to 71 Ge (T1/2 = 2.72 d),\nproducing radioactive atoms which mimic the solar neutrino capture kinematics.\nAlthough neutrinos from the 51 Cr source provide a better match to solar neutrino\nenergies, the second method has the great advantage of large statistics. The measured recovery rate of 71 Ge from gallium is 1 \u00b1 0.01. The two results28,29 together\nrule out the possibility that the solar neutrino deficit observed by GALLEX can be\nattributed to systematic errors in the radiochemical extraction procedure.\nThe SAGE17 experiment is carried out by a Russian-American collaboration\nat the underground Baksan Neutrino Observatory (4715 m.w.e.), in the Northern Caucasus mountains. The detector, which weighs 57 tons, uses gallium in its\nmetallic form. The germanium produced in (35) is removed from the metallic gallium by a liquid-liquid extraction into a HCl \u2212 H2 O2 phase. After this initial step,\nthe experimental technique is very similar to that followed by GALLEX. The results reported by the SAGE collaboration are based on a 10 years exposure time\n(from January 1990 to October 1999), yielding a measured solar neutrino flux of\n17\n74+7.8\nin very good agreement with the GALLEX results. The\n\u22127.4 (stat.+sys.) SNU,\nSAGE detector has been calibrated, exposing 13 tons of metallic gallium to an intense 51 Cr source.30 As for GALLEX, the ratio of the measured production rate to\nthat predicted from the source activity, R = 0.95 \u00b1 0.11(stat.)+0.05\n\u22120.08 , has confirmed\nthat the extraction procedure is reliable.\nIn 1998, after an upgrade of the existing experimental setup, the GNO (Gallium\nNeutrino Observatory) experiment27 started operation at LNGS, as the successor\nproject to the GALLEX experiment. The main aims of GNO are to provide a long\ntime record of low-energy solar neutrinos, to determine the bulk production rate\nwith an accuracy of 5 SNU and to monitor the time dependence of the pp-neutrino\nflux during a whole solar cycle to a precision of \u223c 15%. The GNO collaboration\nhas recently reported the results from the GNO I phase of the experiment, based\non 19 months of observation (from May 1998 to January 2000). The measured solar\n27\nneutrino flux is 65.8+10.7\nwhich confirms the GALLEX result.\n\u221210.2 (stat.+sys.) SNU,\n27\nA combined analysis of GNO I and GALLEX gives 74.1+6.7\n\u22126.8 SNU.\nBoth Kamiokande19 and Super-Kamiokande20 are water-Cherenkov detectors,\nlocated 1000 m underground (2700 m.w.e.), in the Kamioka mine in Japan.\nKamiokande started its operation in 1984 and was originally intended to study\nnucleon decay.31 It was later upgraded to detect also low energy events and succeeded in observing the first solar neutrinos in 1987. Kamiokande was made of a\ncylindrical tank, of total volume 4.5 kton, filled with pure water. An inner volume of\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n15\n\n2.14 kton was defined by 980 inward-looking photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs), used\nto detect the Cherenkov light produced by the relativistic particles traversing the\nwater. Kamiokande ended physics data-taking at the beginning of 1995 and was\ncompletely stopped in summer 1997. Since then its physics programme has been\ncontinued by its successor experiment, Super-Kamiokande.\nSuper-Kamiokande consists of a huge cylindrical tank (volume 50 kton) filled\nwith pure water (water transparency is \u223c 100 m at \u03bb = 420 nm). Also in this case\nan inner volume (16.9 m diameter, 36.2 m height, volume 32.5 kton) is defined by\nan inner surface equipped with a large number of PMTs (11, 146 PMTs of 50 cm\ndiameter, 40% surface coverage). The increased coverage of PMTs makes SuperKamiokande not only bigger than Kamiokande, but also better in terms of energy,\nposition and angular resolution. An outer volume, 2 m thick, equipped with 1, 185\nPMTs (20 cm diameter) surrounds the inner detector and serves as an active veto\ncounter against gamma-rays, neutrons and through-going cosmic muons. For the\nsolar neutrino analysis, the fiducial mass is 22.5 kton, the fiducial volume boundaries\nbeing 2 m inside the inner surface.\nIn both Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande the solar neutrinos are detected\nthrough the observation of the Cherenkov rings produced by the electrons emitted\nin the elastic process:\n\u03bdx + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bdx + e \u2212\n\n(x = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ) .\n\n(36)\n\nAlthough the cross-sections for this process are very small,f elastic interactions turn\nout to be very useful, thanks to the nice correlation between the recoil electron\nmomentum direction and the direction of the incoming neutrino (Ee \u03b8rec \u2264 2me ,\n\u03b8 \u223c 180 for 10 MeV neutrinos). Therefore the direction of the recoil electron can\nbe used to correlate the direction of the impinging neutrino with the Sun's position\nin the sky (see Fig.3). Moreover the energy of the recoiling electron can be used to\nobtain a lower limit on the incoming neutrino energy.\nThe total released energy is correlated to the number of PMT hits, which is in\nturn a function of the total emitted light, corrected for light absorption through\nwater, PMT geometry and overlapping hits. The energy scale, however, must be\ndetermined in an independent manner.\nKamiokande used gamma-rays from the Ni(n,\u03b3)Ni reaction to obtain it.19 The\nmeasurement precision was at the 1\u22122% level, the main limitation being the knowledge of the branching ratios and of the neutron absorption cross-sections for different\nnickel isotopes. Only limited information could be extracted about the energy resolution, while no information at all could be obtained on the angular resolution of\nthe detector.\nSuper-Kamiokande determines the neutrino energy scale by injecting, at various\npositions of the inner detectors, electrons from an electron LINAC placed near the\nf\n\n0.920 \u00d7 10\u221243\n\nneutrinos.\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0010 E\n\u0011\nE\u03bd \u0011\n\u03bd\ncm2 for electron neutrinos and 0.157 \u00d7 10\u221243\ncm2 for muon\n10MeV\n10MeV\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nEvent/day/kton/bin\n\n16\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\ncos\u03b8sun\n\nFig. 3.

The peak emerging at\ncos \u03b8sun over a flat background is due to solar neutrinos.\n\ndetector tank.33 Electrons from the LINAC span the energy range 5 \u2212 16 MeV,\nwhich matches exactly the region relevant for solar neutrinos. By means of this\nprocedure, the absolute energy scale is known to better than 1%. Moreover, Monte\nCarlo studies show that the energy resolution of the detector can be reproduced to\nan accuracy of 2%, while the angular resolution is reproduced to better than 1.50\nfor 10 MeV electrons.\nIn order to check these results and, what is possibly even more important, in\norder to reduce the intrinsic systematic error inherent in the described procedure,g\nanother calibration technique has been introduced.34 A pulsed deuterium-tritium\nneutron generator produces isotropically distributed neutrons of 14.2 MeV, via the\nreaction 3 H +2 H \u21924 He + n. The neutrons create 16 N by the (n, p) reaction on\n16\nO in the water. 16 N decays (\u03c4 = 7.13 s, Q = 10.4 MeV) are characterised by\nthe emission of a 4.3 MeV electron in coincidence with a 6.1 MeV gamma-ray and\nthey are therefore well suited to verify the solar neutrino absolute energy scale.\nAdditional 16 N is also naturally produced in cosmic muon capture by 16 O. These\nevents, which are selected out of the full data sample and which are generally used\nto monitor the solar neutrino signal extraction method, can be also analysed to\ncheck the absolute energy scale. Excellent agreement (within 1%) has been found\nbetween the data and the MC, previously tuned on the LINAC data. Moreover\nit has been possible to show that the position and the angular dependence of the\nenergy scale are within systematic uncertainties for the energy scale of the detector.\nThe energy threshold for Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande is determined by\ng\n\nelectrons from the LINAC only move in a downward direction; due to limited access, the beam\npipe and the LINAC calibration equipment can only be operated at a finite number of positions;\nthe presence of the beam pipe in the tank limits the calibration procedure precision and is in fact\nthe main source of systematic uncertainties at low energy.\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n17\n\nthe threshold for detecting the recoil electron in the elastic scattering (36), which\nis about 5 \u2212 7.5 MeV. Thus the solar neutrino flux measured in those experiments\nis essentially the 8 B flux (plus a small component from the hep reaction in SuperKamiokande). The value measured by Kamiokande, based on 2079 days of datataking (from January 1987 to February 1995), is 2.80 \u00b1 0.19(stat.) \u00b1 0.33(sys.) \u00d7\n106 cm\u22122 s\u22121 .19 The Super-Kamiokande collaboration has recently reported a result\nbased on 1258 days of data-taking, for recoil electrons in the energy range 5 \u2212\n6\n\u22122 \u22121 32\n20 MeV.

Therefore neither an astrophysical\nsolution to the solar neutrino puzzle, nor attributing the discrepancy between theory and experiments to not completely understood systematic uncertainties seem\nacceptable. There must be a particle physics solution to the solar neutrino deficit,\nwhich is however more than a sole normalisation problem. The impossibility of\naccommodating all the experimental results in a consistent picture forces us to go\nbeyond the standard physics framework and to look for explanations which involve\nnew phenomenology.\nThe internal inconsistency of the solar neutrino results is very nicely summarised\n\n\f18\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nFig. 4. Measured vs. predicted solar neutrino rates (fig. from ref.25 ) for all the solar neutrino\nexperiments. The predicted rates for the various components of the neutrino spectrum are taken\nfrom the BP98 model.22\n\nin Fig.4 (from ref.25 ), where a breakdown of all the measured and calculated event\nrates is shown as a function of the experimental technique and of the different reactions contributing to the solar neutrino flux. First of all there is the low rate\nobserved in the chlorine experiment, which basically measures 8 B neutrinos, with\nsmaller contributions from 7 Be and CNO neutrinos. Second, there is the incompatibility between the chlorine and the water-Cherenkov experiments. In fact, since the\nshape of the 8 B neutrino energy spectrum is very stable under reasonable changes\nof the solar parameters, in the absence of new physics it should be possible to\ncompute the 8 B rate in Cl from the spectrum observed by Kamiokande and SuperKamiokande, which essentially measure the 8 B flux at high energies. But the number obtained from the analysis of the water-Cherenkov data is by itself higher than\nthe total flux measured by Homestake. This result, taken as such, implies that the\nnet contribution of the pep, 7 Be and CNO reactions to the total chlorine experiment flux is negative. In other words, the Homestake measurement is compatible\nwith the 7 Be neutrinos being completely suppressed, and this is indeed a big puzzle,\nsince beryllium is needed for the production of 8 B neutrinos. Finally, examining the\ngallium experiments result in detail, one finds that essentially all of the measured\nflux can be accounted for by only considering the contribution from the pp-cycle,\nwhich is known within 1% and therefore is not questionable. Ignoring for simplicity\nthe small contribution from 8 B neutrinos (which, by the way, can also be derived\nfrom water-Cherenkov results), this means that there is no room to accommodate\nthe significant contribution expected from the 7 Be lines.\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n19\n\nThe strong correlation between the predicted 7 Be and the 8 B fluxes is shown in\nFig.5 for many different solar models, together with the best fit solution for the 7 Be\nflux as obtained from experimental data. All the fluxes have been normalised to the\npredictions of the BP98 model and a 3\u03c3 rectangle has been drawn, showing that\nall models but one (that of Dar-Shaviv36) agree with each other within 3\u03c3 of the\nBP98 model and are all far away from the value derived from experimental data.\n\nFig. 5. Correlation between the 7 Be and the 8 B fluxes (normalised to BP98 predictions) as given\nby published solar models (fig. from ref.35 ). The rectangle corresponds to the 3\u03c3 contour for\nthe BP98 model prediction and the ellipses are the 1, 2, 3\u03c3 contours for the best fit solution as\nobtained from all experimental data assuming no new physics.\n\nIn summary, if one believes the conclusions of the standard solar models, the\nsolar neutrino puzzle can only be solved if one is either ready to discard at least\nthree experimental results (the chlorine experiment and either the gallium or the\nwater-Cherenkov measurements), which seems unreasonable, or to accept that new\nphysics, not accounted for in the standard model of electro-weak interactions, is\nmodifying the energy spectrum of solar neutrinos.\nOne very attractive possibility is that neutrino oscillations are changing the\nneutrino flavour composition while they travel between the centre of the Sun and\nthe Earth. If solar electron neutrinos have transformed into muon or tau neutrinos\nbefore reaching the detector, given their low average energy they would fail to\nproduce muons or taus via charged-current interactions. A \"disappearance\" of\nelectron neutrinos in the chlorine and gallium experiments would then become an\nexpected effect. The deficit in the water-Cherenkov experiments, where in principle\nmuon and tau neutrinos could be detected via their neutral-current scatters with\nelectrons of the medium, could also be explained by the low cross-section for that\nprocess.\nInterpreting the solar neutrino deficit in the two-flavour mixing framework, allowed regions can be drawn on the oscillation parameter space {sin2 2\u03b8, \u2206m2 } at a\n\n\f20\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nFig. 6. Allowed regions (99 % C.L.) on the plane (sin2 2\u03b8, \u2206m2 ), as obtained in ref.35 from\na combined two-flavour analysis of the total rate results in the chlorine, SAGE, GALLEX and\nSuper-Kamiokande experiments, for oscillations in matter (left) and in vacuum (right).\n\nset C.L..h For example, Fig.6 shows the 99 % C.L. solutions as obtained in ref.35\nfrom a combined analysis of the total rate results in the chlorine, SAGE, GALLEX\nand Super-Kamiokande experiments, for oscillations in matter (MSW solutions,\nleft) and in vacuum (\"Just-so\" or VO solutions, right). The matter solutions are\nconventionally named according to the allowed ranges of the oscillation parameters:\nsmall mixing angle (SMA, \u2206m2 \u223c 10\u22125 eV2 , sin2 2\u03b8 \u223c 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22122 ), large mixing angle (LMA, \u2206m2 \u223c 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22124 eV2 , sin2 2\u03b8 > 0.5) and low \u2206m2 (LOW,\n\u2206m2 \u223c 10\u22127 eV2 , sin2 2\u03b8 > 0.9). The VO solution (\u2206m2 < 10\u22129 eV2 ) corresponds\nto the case when one astronomical unit exactly matches the neutrino oscillation\nlength for typical solar energies.\nOne way to discriminate between small and large mixing angles is to consider\nthe so-called \"day/night effect\". Neutrinos detected during night, as opposed to\nneutrinos detected during day, are subject to matter effects in the Earth, which are\nexpected to be sizeable for large values of the mixing angle. The solar neutrino flux\ncan be studied as a function of the solar zenith angle \u03b8z and an asymmetry A can\nbe defined:\nA=\n\n\u03a6N \u2212 \u03a6D\n,\n\u03a6N + \u03a6D\n\n(37)\n\nwhere \u03a6N and \u03a6D are the night and day fluxes respectively. A non-zero asymmetry\nhAs\n\nstressed in ref.37 , under certain conditions the MSW solutions to the solar neutrino deficit can\nextend to the \u03c0/4 < \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 domain, which is not covered by the standard two-flavour analyses; to\novercome this problem, results can be more conveniently presented in the {tan2 \u03b8, \u2206m2 } parameter\nspace.\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n21\n\nwould favour large mixing angles. Another way to separate between the two regimes\nis to consider the shape of the solar zenith angle distribution, which is expected to\nbe flat for large mixing angles, while for small mixing angles it should show an\nexcess of events in the upward-going direction (around \u22121 < cos \u03b8z < \u22120.8).\nData/SSM\n\nData/SSM\n\n0.55\n\n0.5\n\n0.45\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nDay\nNight\n\nAll\n\nDay\n\n0.35\n\n0.7\n\n-1\n\nNight\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n1\ncos\u03b8z\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n14 20\nEnergy(MeV)\n\nFig. 7.

It turns\nout that, if the predicted hep neutrino flux is correct, a distribution peaked at high\nenergies would favour the VO solution.\nFinally, strong evidence for neutrino oscillations in vacuum would come from\nthe observation of a seasonal variation of the solar neutrino flux, different from the\nstandard geometrical one due to the orbit eccentricity of the Earth(\u01eb = 0.0167).i\ni For\n\n\u2206m2 of the order of that suggested by the VO solution, and for solar neutrino energies of the\norder of \u223c few MeV, the seasonal change in the distance between the Sun and the Earth (\u2206R\u2299 =\n\n\f22\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nThe day-night asymmetry obtained by Super-Kamiokande based on 1258 days\n32\nof data is A = 0.033 \u00b1 0.022(stat.)+0.013\nwhich is only a 1.3\u03c3 deviation\n\u22120.012 (sys.),\nfrom zero asymmetry.

The\nmeasured energy spectrum shows no statistically significant distortion relative to\nthe predicted 8 B spectrum (Fig.7, right). No deviation from the expected standard\nannual variation of the neutrino flux has been observed (see Fig.8).\nThe Super-Kamiokande collaboration has recently performed a flux-independent\n\u03c72 analysis of their data, assuming two-flavour mixing.

Many questions still remain open and it is therefore fair to say that still\nlot of information is missing and further experimental effort is required. Along\nthis line there come the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory project (SNO),38 which has\nbeen running for about one year, as well as the Borexino39 and the KamLAND40\nexperiments, which are both scheduled to start data taking very soon.\nSNO is a 1 kton heavy-water Cherenkov detector located 2 km underground\n(6010 m.w.e), in the Creighton mine, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The detector is\nmade of a spherical acrylic vessel, 12 m diameter, containing ultra-pure D2 O and\nsurrounded by an ultra-pure H2 O shield, in turn contained in a cylindrical cavity\n(34 m height, 22 m maximum diameter). The light produced in the water is detected\nby 9, 456 PMTs (20 cm diameter) with light concentrator, installed on a stainless\nsteel structure surrounding the acrylic vessel.\nAs well as using the elastic scattering (ES) reaction (36), as Kamiokande and\nSuper-Kamiokande do, SNO can detect 8 B solar neutrinos via charged-current (CC)\nand neutral-current (NC) interactions on deuterium:\n\u03bde + d \u2192 p + p + e \u2212\n\n(threshold = 1.4 MeV)\n\n(38)\n\n\u03bdx + d \u2192 n + p + \u03bdx\n\n(threshold = 2.2 MeV) .\n\n(39)\n\nand:\n\nFor completeness, we give again the ES reaction (36):\n\u03bdx + e \u2212 \u2192 \u03bdx + e \u2212\n\n(x = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ) .\n\n(36)\n\nNeutral current interactions do not depend on the flavour of the incident neutrino\nand therefore neutrino oscillations to active neutrinos should not affect the number\nof NC events. On the other hand, given the energy range for solar neutrinos, \u03bd\u03bc and\n\u03bd\u03c4 coming from oscillated \u03bde would be below threshold for the production of their\ncharged partners: the CC sample would then be depleted by neutrino oscillations.\nThis means that the CC/NC ratio can be used as a powerful probe to test the\noscillation hypothesis. Moreover, following the same argument, any distortion in\nthe measured CC energy spectrum with respect to predictions would be another\nsignature of new physics.\nThe electron produced in (38), as opposed to that produced in (36), carries\nmost of the neutrino kinetic energy in the final state. Therefore it provides a better\nestimate of the initial neutrino energy (resolution of \u223c 20% for the range of interest)\nand can be used to observe possible distortions of the neutrino energy spectrum.\nWhile electrons produced in CC and ES reactions are detected via the associated Cherenkov light, neutrons from reaction (39) are detected using different\ntechniques during the three different phases of the experiment. In the first phase,\nrecently concluded, when only heavy water was used, they were measured through\n\n\f24\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nthe 6.25 MeV photons produced in the neutron capture (25% efficiency); in the\ncurrent phase, when 2.5 tons of NaCl have been added to the water, they are seen\nthrough the 8.6 MeV photons produced in the neutron capture on Cl (85% efficiency); finally, and this will be SNO's third phase, the salt will be removed and\n3\nHe proportional counters will be installed, allowing direct detection of the neutrons (45% efficiency) and measurement of the spectra with completely different\nsystematics.\nThe sample collected during the first phase, when the sensitivity to NC was\nlower, is essentially dominated by CC interactions, with a smaller component from\nES events. Therefore the CC/NC comparison will not be possible until data from\nthe second phase, with the NC rate highly enhanced by the addition of salt, become available. However some information on neutrino oscillations can already be\nextracted from the first phase data, by comparing the CC and ES rates. In fact,\nwhile the CC reaction (38) is only sensitive to \u03bde 's, because of the low solar neutrino energy, the ES reaction (36) is sensitive to all active neutrinos, although with\na reduced sensitivity to \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 . Thus, if neutrino oscillations change the flavour\ncomposition of the solar neutrino flux, transforming a fraction of the original \u03bde 's\ninto other active neutrino species, the CC sample will be depleted, while the ES\nsample remains unchanged. In other words, if the CC and ES measurements of the\n8\nB electron neutrino fluxes give:\nES\n\u03a6CC\n8 B (\u03bde ) < \u03a68 B (\u03bde ) ,\n\n(40)\n\nthen, without having to refer to any particular solar model, the inequality between\nthe two measured values can by itself be interpreted as an indication of neutrino\noscillations to active neutrinos.\nThe SNO collaboration has very recently published their first results on ES and\nCC reactions, based on 240.95 live days of data.3 In order to avoid biases in the\nevent selection procedure, the data has been sub-divided in two subsets, with 70%\nof them used to establish the analysis procedure and the remaining 30% used as\na blind sample to validate the analysis itself. The final data set consists of 1169\nevents.\nThe different contributions from CC, ES and residual neutron events are extracted by means of a maximum likelihood function, which combines the information from three variables: the effective kinetic energy of the event, the angle between\nthe reconstructed direction of the event and the instantaneous Sun-to-Earth direction and a volume-weighted radial variable, related to the position of the event\ninside the detector. The breakdown of the events as obtained from the likelihood\nmaximisation is given in Tab.4.\nSNO data show that the shape of the CC energy spectrum is consistent with\nthe Bahcall SSM predictions within one standard deviation. However, the low ratio\nof the measured 8 B flux to SSM predictions,23 0.347 \u00b1 0.029,3 confirms the solar\nneutrino deficit. Moreover it is smaller than what obtained by Super-Kamiokande\nfrom the analysis of ES events.32\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n25\n\nTable 4.

This result, by showing that the electron neutrino flux from CC interactions is indeed smaller than that obtained from\nES events, provides quite a convincing hint for appearance of non-electron active\nneutrino flavours in the solar neutrino flux.\nIf electron neutrinos oscillated to sterile neutrinos, the 8 B flux derived by SNO\nusing CC events with energy above 6.75 MeV should be consistent with the flux\nmeasured by Super-Kamiokande using ES interactions above 8.5 MeV.41 Instead,\ncorrecting for the different energy threshold used in the latest Super-Kamiokande\nanalysis,32 the two fluxes differ by (0.53 \u00b1 0.17) \u00d7 106 cm\u22122 s\u22121 , that is to say 3.1 \u03c3.\nTherefore the SNO data exclude the possibility that the solar neutrino deficit can\nbe explained by pure \u03bde \u2192 \u03bds oscillations.\nIn the hypothesis that the observed solar neutrino deficit is due to oscillations\nof \u03bde 's to other active neutrino species (\u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 ), the flux of non-electron active\nneutrinos, \u03a6\u03bc\u03c4 , can be inferred.

Moreover the experiment measures a\n8\nB neutrino flux consistent with the SSM expectations. These are only the first of\nseveral very interesting measurements that SNO should be able to perform over the\nnext few years: we now look forward to the results from the experiment's second\nphase.\nBorexino,39 a 300 ton liquid scintillator detector with PMT readout, is being installed at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory. Thanks to the high radiopurity\nand to the high light yield of the scintillator, it will be able to detect neutrinoelectron scattering with an energy threshold as low as 250 keV. This means that\nthe 7 Be lines, especially that at 0.863 MeV, will be within the reach of the experiment. The monochromaticity of the beryllium line should facilitate the observation\nof VO-induced variation of the solar neutrino flux, which for Borexino would be a\nspectacular effect. Moreover Borexino will also be able to check the LOW solution,\nby studying the day/night effect for beryllium neutrinos, which is expected to be\nstrong if indeed oscillations occur with the LOW parameters.42 Borexino is expected\nto start data-taking in 2002.\nA test of the LMA solution will be made by the KamLAND40 experiment, a\n1 kton liquid scintillator detector, located in the Kamioka mine in Japan. The\nexperiment will detect the low-energy (1 \u2212 8 MeV) \u03bd\u0304e flux emitted by the nuclear\nreactors at several Japanese power stations, at distances between 150 and 210 km\nfrom the detector. The estimated sensitivity of KamLAND is such that, at 90% C.L.\nand after three years of data taking, the experiment should be able to cover the entire\ndomain defined by the LMA solution (down to \u2206m2 \u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u22126 eV2 ). If oscillations\nare observed, the oscillation parameters should be determined to a precision of 20%,\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n27\n\nat 99% C.L.. KamLAND is expected to start data-taking at the end of this year.\nMore experiments are planned to study solar neutrinos in the future. Among\nthem one should certainly mention ICARUS,43 a liquid-argon TPC detector, which\nwill be mainly sensitive to 8 B and of which the first 600 tons half-module is currently under test, HERON,44 which plans to study pp and beryllium neutrinos using\nsuperfluid helium as a target, and HELLAZ,45 which intends to study low-energy\nneutrinos, down to the pp neutrino energies, using a gaseous helium TPC.\nIn the previous sections we have outlined the solar neutrino problem, which historically represents the first experimental hint for neutrino oscillations. We have\ndescribed the standard solar model results and the arguments which make the model\nconvincing and robust. We have discussed how experimental data are in striking\ncontradiction with expectations, if no new physics is taken into account, and we\nhave summarize the results obtained when the solar neutrino deficit is interpreted\nas being due to neutrino oscillations. We now want to plunge into another exiting domain, that of atmospheric neutrinos, which undoubtedly provide the most\nconvincing experimental evidence for neutrino oscillations.\n6. The Atmospheric Neutrino Anomaly\n6.1. Atmospheric Neutrino Flux and Neutrino Oscillations\nAtmospheric neutrinos are produced in the decay of secondary particles created\nin the interaction of primary cosmic raysj with the Earth's atmosphere. If the energy\nof the secondary particles is sufficiently low (. 2 GeV) that all of them decay, we\nhave:\np + N \u2212\u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 + X\n\n\u03c0 \u00b1 \u2212\u2192 \u03bc\u00b1 + \u03bd\u03bc (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc )\n\u00b1\n\n(45)\n\n\u00b1\n\n\u03bc \u2212\u2192 e + \u03bde (\u03bd\u0304e ) + \u03bd\u0304\u03bc (\u03bd\u03bc )\nAssuming that no effect can change the flavour composition of the shower before it\nis measured on Earth, Eq.(45) implies that:\nR=\n\nN\u03bd\u03bc + N\u03bd\u0304\u03bc\n\u223c2\nN\u03bde + N\u03bd\u0304e\n\n(46)\n\nwhere N\u03bd\u03bc (N\u03bde ) and N\u03bd\u0304\u03bc (N\u03bd\u0304e ) are the number of muon (electron) neutrinos and\nanti-neutrinos respectively. The exact value of R can in principle be affected by\nseveral effects, such as the primary spectrum composition, the geomagnetic cut-off,\nsolar activity and, of course, the details of the model for the development of the\nhadronic shower. However, it has to be said that, although the absolute neutrino\nfluxes are rather badly known (predictions from different calculations disagree by\n\u223c 20 \u2212 30%), the ratio (46) is to first order insensitive to such uncertainties and is\nj mainly\n\nprotons (\u223c 80%) and \u03b1-particles (\u223c 15%), plus a small contribution from heavier nuclei.46\n\n\f28\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nknown to \u223c 5%. Neutrino oscillations would manifest themselves as a discrepancy\nbetween the measured and the expected value of the ratio R.\nIn order to quote a number which is independent of experimental parameters,\nsuch as energy thresholds and detector acceptances for signal and background, the\nresult is generally presented in terms of the double ratio:\n#\n\"\nN\u03bd\u03bc + N\u03bd\u0304\u03bc\nN\u03bde + N\u03bd\u0304e\nRDAT A\n#DAT A ,\nR\u2032 \u2261\n= \"\n(47)\nRMC\nN\u03bd\u03bc + N\u03bd\u0304\u03bc\nN\u03bde + N\u03bd\u0304e\nMC\n\nwhere RDAT A is the measured ratio of muon-like (i.e. \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) over electron-like\n(i.e. \u03bde , \u03bd\u0304e ) events and RMC is the same ratio as obtained from a Monte Carlo\nsimulation. Assuming a correct modelling for RMC , R\u2032 < 1 could either mean that\nthere is a deficit of measured muon-like events, or that an excess of electron-like\nevents has been observed. The quantity (47) alone cannot discriminate between\nthese two possibilities. Moreover, a low value of R\u2032 is not by itself a proof for neutrino oscillations, since one could imagine other mechanisms (i.e. neutrino decay)\ninducing a similar effect.\n\nDown- \u03bd\n\np,He\n\nZenith\nZenith\nDetector\n\n\u03b1 \u0398\n\n\u03c0,\u039a\n\n-\u03bd\n\n(\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03c0\u2212\u0398\n\n)\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03b1\n\n-\u03bd\n\n(\n\n-\u03bd\n\n(\n)\n\ne\n\n)\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u0398\n\nUp- \u03bd\n\nEarth\nDetector\n\nFig. 11. Sketch of the atmospheric neutrinos detection principles.\n\nAnother, more sensitive way to detect neutrino oscillations is the study of the\nzenith angle distribution of the incoming atmospheric neutrino. Downward-going\nneutrinos, produced in the atmosphere above the detector, will travel a path of the\norder of 10 \u2212 20 km, while upward-going neutrinos, produced at the opposite side of\nthe globe, will have travelled up to 12, 000 km before detection. This means that,\nby studying the neutrino flux as a function of the zenith angle, one has access to\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n29\n\nbaselines spanning three orders of magnitude and can therefore hope to observe the\nmodulation induced on the flux by neutrino oscillations.\nIf no oscillation occurs between the production point and the detector, assuming for simplicity that no other effect alters the cosmic ray angular distribution, the\nneutrino flux per unit area is the same at any location on the Earth. If we consider the contribution to the flux from a point at zenith angle \u0398 (downward-going\nneutrinos) and we compare it to the flux at zenith angle \u03c0 \u2212 \u0398 (upward-going neutrinos), based on simple symmetry considerations (see Fig.11), we can demonstrate\nthat the two quantities must have the same value in the absence of new physics.\nIn summary, in the no-oscillation hypothesis, the zenith angle distribution must be\nup-down symmetric, assuming no other phenomena affecting the neutrino angular\ndistribution relative to the local vertical direction. Conversely, any deviation from\nup-down symmetry could be interpreted as an indication for neutrino oscillations.\n\nR'\nR'\n\nNo osc.\n\npe\nSu\n\n(F\n\nC\n\n)\n\nrK\n\nSub-GeV\nMulti-GeV\n\nFig. 12. Compilation of the R\u2032 ratio (see text) measured by several atmospheric neutrino experiments (from ref.47 ).\n\nHistorically, the first results on what is nowadays known as the atmospheric\nneutrino anomaly came from experiments originally designed to search for proton\ndecay, for which the atmospheric neutrino flux constituted a background source. A\ncompilation of results on R\u2032 from different experiments is shown in Fig.12 (from\nref.47 ): all measurements are systematically below one and all but two give a value\nfor R\u2032 close to 0.7.\nThe first experiment to report, in 1986, a discrepancy between the observed\nand the predicted number of atmospheric neutrinos, although that was not immediately recognised as a possible effect of neutrino oscillations, was IMB,48 a\nwater-Cherenkov detector located in the Morton mine, Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Two\nyears later Kamiokande confirmed that the measured deficit of muon-like events\nwas the order of 30%.49 However, the same effect was not observed by two other\nproton decay experiments, NUSEX,50 and Fr\u00e9jus,51 , both using fine-grained iron\ncalorimeters. This discrepancy led for some time to the belief that poorly understood systematic effects, mainly related to an incomplete description of neutrino\ninteractions in iron and water, were inducing an intrinsic difference between the\ntwo experimental techniques. Although later calculations had already shown that\n\n\f30\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nthe neglected physical processes could account for at most a 10 \u2212 15% change in the\nexpected event rates,52 the issue was only definitively resolved when the Soudan2\nexperiment,53 another fine-grained iron calorimeter, located in the Soudan mine\n(2100 m.w.e.), Ely, Minnesota, USA, confirmed Kamiokande and IMB results. It\nis now common belief that the original discrepancy was due to fluctuations in NUSEX and Fr\u00e9jus data. In 1994 Kamiokande showed a distortion of the zenith angle\ndistribution in the multi-GeV contained events (see below for a definition),54 which\nseemed to confirm the neutrino oscillation hypothesis. Kamiokande and IMB as well\nas Baksan,55 an experiment in the former Soviet Union, and MACRO,56 a proton\ndecay experiment at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, also tried to extract information\nfrom the sample of particles travelling in the vertical direction, but the results were\nnot consistent with each other and none of them seemed conclusive.\nThe big change in the scientific community's perception of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly certainly came from the results obtained by the Super-Kamiokande\nexperiment,57,58,59 which in summer 1998 announced evidence for neutrino oscillations in the atmospheric neutrino sample. However, before we discuss atmospheric\nneutrinos in Super-Kamiokande, we shall first present some of the ideas and the\nstatus of the atmospheric neutrino flux calculations.\n6.2. Atmospheric Neutrino Flux Calculations\nThe neutrino flux on Earth (approximately 1 event/cm2 /sr/sec) can in principle\nbe calculated either starting from the spectrum of the primary protons and alpha\nparticles which initiate the hadronic cascade in the atmosphere, or from the measured muon flux at high altitudes. In the first case it is necessary to parametrize\nthe hadronic shower development, thus requiring a relatively good understanding\nof the pion production process at the relevant energies. On the other hand, the\nmuon acceptance has the disadvantage of being quite sensitive to variations of the\ngeomagnetic field. Moreover the exposure time for muon flux measurements is quite\nshort, the relevant experiments being generally performed on balloons,60,61,62 while\nprimary fluxes measurements, made at high altitudes or above the atmosphere, are\nusually made over relatively longer intervals.60,63,64,65,66 In any case a measurement of the muon flux gives a useful constraint on the the atmospheric neutrino\nflux calculations.\nAt low geomagnetic latitudes the trajectories of low energy primary cosmic rays\ncan be significantly deviated under the action of the geomagnetic field and, in extreme cases (energies of the order of few GeV), they would not reach the atmosphere\nat all. At intermediate energies (10 \u2212 20 GeV), the flux of primary cosmic particles\nexhibits a strong east-west asymmetry, while at high energies the flux is essentially unaffected by the terrestrial magnetic field. In summary, the net effect of\nthe geomagnetic field is a non-isotropy of the neutrino flux even in the absence of\noscillations. This has been observed by Super-Kamiokande,58 which has measured\nan east-west asymmetry (see Fig.13, from ref.58 ) consistent with expectations, thus\nconfirming that the details of the geomagnetic effects on the cosmic radiation are\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n31\n\n(NE-NW)/(NE+NW)\n\n0.4\n\ne-like\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-0.3\n-0.4\n\n(NE-NW)/(NE+NW)\n\n10\n\n2\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n\u03bc-like\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-0.3\n-0.4\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\nLepton Momentum (MeV/c)\n\nFig. 13.

In Super-Kamiokande (geomagnetical latitude 25.80 N, close to\nthe geomagnetic equator) the cutoff momentum for protons arriving horizontally\nfrom the east is \u223c 50 GeV.\nA modulation of the low energy component of the primary cosmic ray flux is\nexpected as a function of the solar activity (cycle of \u223c 11 years), which induces\nfluctuations in the geomagnetic field (see for example ref.67 ): the greater the solar\nactivity, the lower the primary cosmic ray flux on the Earth. The correlation between the relative sun-spot number and the cosmic ray flux can be studied using\nthe data from the Mount Washington neutron monitor.68 The influence of the solar\nwind is only sizeable (\u223c 15 \u2212 20%) for neutrino energies of 1 GeV or below and\nonly at high geomagnetic latitudes, where the geomagnetic effect is minimal, while\nit becomes negligible at \u223c 2 GeV.69\n\nThe experimental results for atmospheric neutrinos are usually presented in\nterms of the neutrino flux calculations performed by Honda and collaborators\n(HKKM)70 and by the Bartol group.71 A comparison between the two models and a\ncompilation of some of the most recent data on primary protons is shown in Fig.14\n(from ref.72 ).\nBoth HKKM and the Bartol models are based on one-dimensional computations,\nin the sense that the momenta of all secondary particles, hadrons, charged leptons\nas well as neutrinos, are assumed to be collinear with that of primary cosmic ray\n(1-D calculation). It has only very recently been realized that three-dimensional\n(3-D) calculations can be important for a correct description of the neutrino spatial\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n10\n\n4\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n1.5\n\nE *Diff.

According to\nthe author of ref.72 , a preliminary comparison with HKKM shows that, if they\nhad used the same primary spectrum as an input, also their predictions on the\nnormalisation would have been lower than FLUKA's.\nIn summary, even if the e/\u03bc ratio is rather well known, the uncertainties on\nthe absolute neutrino fluxes are still quite large. Among the dominant sources\nof systematic errors are the knowledge of the primary fluxes, still limited despite\nnew data has been recently made available, and the uncertainties on the secondary\nparticle production model. Other effects, such as the atmosphere modelling and\nthe detector altitude, play only a marginal role. In order to improve the theoretical\ncalculations it is very important that further constraints on the models are obtained\nfrom new experimental data.\nSeveral experiments relevant for the atmospheric neutrino flux calculations should\nbe taking data over the next few years.

More recently a proposal for another experiment has been submitted\nto CERN:78 if approved, that experiment would make use of the NA4979 apparatus to study hadroproduction in a range of energies (120 GeV) relevant for both\natmospheric neutrinos and long-baseline neutrino oscillation projects.\nAmong the new proposals to study cosmic ray muons for the determination of\nthe neutrino fluxes, an interesting project, known as ADLER,80 is now in its design\nstage. The main idea is to fly a small detector on board an aircraft to measure\nthe atmospheric muon flux at different geomagnetic latitudes. This possibility,\ntogether with the relatively longer exposure times, would be an obvious advantage\nwith respect to balloon-borne experiments.\n6.3. Atmospheric Neutrinos in Super-Kamiokande\nWe have already given a brief description of the Super-Kamiokande experiment\nand will not repeat it here, however it is worth summarising some information\nrelevant for the following discussion. Atmospheric neutrinos are detected in SuperKamiokande by measuring the Cherenkov rings generated by the primary particles\nproduced in the neutrino CC interactions with the water nuclei. Thanks to the high\nPMT coverage, the experiment is characterised by an extremely good light yield (\u223c 8\nphoto-electron per MeV) and can detect events of energies as low as \u223c 5 MeV. The\n\n\f34\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nlarge detector mass and the possibility of clearly defining a large inner volume allow\nto collect a high statistics sample of fully contained events (FC) of relatively high\nenergies (up to \u223c 5 GeV), the FC events being defined as those having both the\nneutrino vertex and the resulting particle tracks entirely within the fiducial volume.\nThe contamination from downward-going cosmic muons is drastically reduced by the\ncontainment requirement on the primary vertex coordinates. Fully contained events\ncan be further subdivided into two subsets, the so-called sub-GeV and multi-GeV\nevents, with energies below and above 1.33 GeV respectively. In Super-Kamiokande\njargon FC events include only single-ring events, while multi-ring ones (MRING)\nare treated as a separate category. Another sub-sample, defined as the partially\ncontained events (PC), is represented by those charged-current interactions where\nthe vertex is still within the fiducial volume, but at least a primary particle, typically\nthe muon, exits the detector without releasing all of its energy: for those events the\nenergy resolution is therefore worse than for FC interactions. Finally, upwardgoing muons (UPMU), produced by neutrinos coming from below and interacting\nin the rock, can also be used to independently check the neutrino oscillation result.\nIn the literature they are sometimes further subdivided into stopping muons and\nthrough-going muons, according to whether or not they stop in the detector. The\ndifferent samples defined above explore different ranges of the neutrino energy: this\nis shown in Fig.16 (from ref.82 ), where the event rates for sub-GeV and multi-GeV\nFC events, as well as for through-going and stopping muons is shown. For PC\nevents the neutrino energy is in the multi-GeV range.\n\n0.015\n\n5\n\ndN/dlnE, (Kt.yr) -1\n\n4\n\nthrough-going\nmuons\n\nmulti\nGeV\n\n0.01\n\n(m 2 .yr.ster) -1\n\nsub\nGeV\n\n3\n\n2\n0.005\n\nstopping\nmuons\n\n1\n\n0\n\n10 -1\n\n10 0\n\n10 1\n\n10 2\n\n10 3\n\n10 4\n\n0\n\n10 5\n\nE \u03bd , GeV\n\nFig. 16. Event rates as a function of the neutrino energy for some of the different categories of\nneutrino interactions defined in the text (fig. from ref.82 ).\n\nParticle identification in Super-Kamiokande is performed using likelihood functions to parametrize the sharpness of the Cherenkov rings, which are more diffused\nfor electrons than for muons. The algorithms, which have been tested on cosmic\nmuons, decay electron samples and using test-beam data,81 are able to discriminate\nthe two flavours with very high purity (of the order of 98% for single track events).\nThe most recent value for R\u2032 reported by the Super-Kamiokande collaboration,\nbased on 1289 days of data, is 0.638+0.017\n\u22120.017 \u00b1 0.050 for the sub-GeV sample and\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n35\n\n83\n0.675+0.034\nThus the mea\u22120.032 \u00b1 0.080 for the multi-GeV sample (both FC and PC).\n\u2032\nsured value of R is different from unity by about 7 \u03c3.\n\nNumber of Events\n\ncos\u03b8\n\nMulti-GeV e-like\n\n140\n\nNumber of Events\n\n450 Sub-GeV \u03bc-like\n400\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n1\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n\ncos\u03b8\n\n300\n\n120\n\n250\n\n100\n\n200\n\n80\n\n150\n\n60\n\n100\n\n40\n\n50\n\n20\n0\n\n1\n\n350 Multi-GeV \u03bc-like + PC\n\nNumber of Events\n\nNumber of Events\n\n450 Sub-GeV e-like\n400\n350\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\ncos\u03b8\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\ncos\u03b8\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFig. 17. Distribution of the cosine of the zenith angle obtained by Super-Kamiokade from 1289 live\ndays data, for electron-like and muon-like contained events (from ref.84 ). The solid line is the\ndistribution expected in absence of oscillations, while the hatched histogram is for \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4\noscillations in the two-flavour mixing scheme, with maximal mixing and sin2 2\u03b8 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 .\n\nThe distributions of the cosine of the zenith angle for the sub-GeV and the\nmulti-GeV samples are shown in Fig.17 (1289 live days, from ref.84 ). In both subsets the electron-like events are in good agreement with predictions in absence of\noscillations, while the muon spectrum, which strikingly disagrees with no-oscillation\nexpectations, is well described by an oscillation induced modulation. It has to be\nnoticed that, while the sub-GeV muon sample is depleted over the entire spectrum,\nthe deficit being larger for smaller values of cos \u0398, the spectrum of neutrinos coming from above (cos \u0398 > 0) is very little changed in the case of multi-GeV muons.\nThis is consistent with \u03bd\u03bc oscillations occurring with a value of \u2206m2 which is better\nmatched by low-energy neutrinos (sub-GeV), while for high energy neutrinos the effect of oscillations becomes sizeable only for larger baselines (neutrinos coming from\nbelow). However it has to be stressed that the angular resolution degrades at lower\nenergies, where the lepton momentum direction becomes a worse approximation for\nthe incoming neutrino direction.\nA useful dimensionless quantity which can be derived from the zenith angle\ndistribution is the so-called up-down asymmetry A, defined as the difference between\nthe number of upward-going (U, cos \u0398 < \u22120.2) and the number of downward-going\n\n\f36\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n(D, cos \u0398 > 0.2) neutrinos, divided by the sum of the two numbers:\nU \u2212D\n.\nU +D\n\nA=\n\n(48)\n\nWe have seen that, neglecting the geomagnetic effect corrections, which can be taken\ninto account in the simulation, there is no reason to have any asymmetry in the\nneutrino flux. Any deviation of A from zero is a signature for new physics and can\nbe interpreted in terms of neutrino oscillations. The dependence of this quantity\non the measured particle momentum is shown in Fig.18 (left) for electron-like and\nmuon-like events (both FC and PC). The uncertainty assumed on the absolute\nnormalisation is 25%, with 20% contribution from the neutrino flux calculation and\n15% from the neutrino interaction cross section. Also here the experimental data are\nconsistent with neutrino oscillations in the muon sample, while electron neutrinos\nappear to be unaffected. In agreement with the oscillation hypothesis, we see that\nfor muon-like events the asymmetry is essentially zero at low energies, where the\noscillation length is small and therefore both upward-going and downward-going\nmuons are equally depleted, while for increasing values of the muon momentum,\nwhen mostly neutrinos from below are affected by the oscillation, the asymmetry\nbecomes more and more negative.\n\n0.5\n\ne-like\n1.5\n\n-0.5\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n\u03bc-like\nFC\n\nPC\n\n2\n\nData / Monte Carlo\n\n(U-D)/(U+D)\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\ne-like\n\n0\n\n\u03bc-like\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nMomentum (GeV/c)\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\nL/E\u03bd (km/GeV)\n\nFig. 18.

Also here electron-like events show no evidence for oscillations, while muonlike events show a dependence on L/E which, although the oscillatory pattern is\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n37\n\n\u2206m2 (eV2)\n\nwashed out by angular and energy resolution, is consistent with the oscillations\nhypothesis.\nInterpreting the muon-like event deficit as the result of \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 oscillations in\nthe two-flavour mixing scheme, Super-Kamiokande extract an allowed domain for\nthe oscillation parameters. Events are binned in a multi-dimensional space defined\nby particle type, energy and zenith angle, plus a set of parameters to account\nfor systematic uncertainties. The result of the fit based on 1289 days of data,\nusing FC, PC, UPMU and MRING events, is given in Fig.19, left. The best fit\ncorresponds to maximal mixing and \u2206m2 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 .84 For comparison,\nan earlier plotk of Super-Kamiokande allowed region (90% C.L.) is shown together\nwith those obtained by Kamiokande,49 , Soudan2,85 and MACRO.86 In particular it\nis interesting to consider how the preferred solution for \u2206m2 indicated by SuperKamiokande is lower than that previously presented by Kamiokande, with only a\nvery small overlap between the 90% C.L. contours obtained by the two experiments.\nThe reason for this effect is not fully understood, although one possible explanation\ncould be the different fitting procedure, which for Kamiokande is based on the\nflavour ratio R\u2032 only, while in Super-Kamiokade a shape analysis of the energy and\nthe zenith angle spectra is performed.\nThe Soudan285 and the MACRO86 experiments, although with less sensitivity,\nhave confirmed an atmospheric neutrino anomaly consistent with that observed by\nSuper-Kamiokande.\n\n10\n\n\u03bd\u03bc - \u03bd\u03c4\n\n-1\n\n10\n\npreliminary\n\n-1\n\nKamiokande\nup-\u03bc\n\nKamiokande FC+PC\nSoudan 2\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n\u2206m2 (eV2)\n\n10\n\nMACRO\nup-\u03bc\n\nSK\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-3\n\nMACRO low E\n\n68% C.L.\n90% C.L.\n99% C.L.\n-4\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n2\n\n1\n\nsin 2\u03b8\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\n1\n\nsin22\u03b8\n\nFig. 19.

(Right) An earlier contour from SuperKamiokande87 is compared to Kamiokande,49 , Soudan285 and MACRO86 results (fig. from ref.87 ).\n\nThe Super-Kamiokande interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly in\nterms of muon disappearance rather than electron appearance is corroborated by\nkthe\n\narguments outlined in the following do not change if the latest Super-Kamiokande results are\nconsidered.\n\n\f38\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nthe results obtained by CHOOZ88 and Palo Verde,89 two neutrino oscillation experiments at nuclear reactors, which have studied \u03bd\u0304e disappearance in the parameter region relevant for atmospheric neutrinos. In particular CHOOZ limits (at 90% C.L.,\n\u2206m2 < 7 \u00d7 10\u22124 for maximum mixing and sin2 2\u03b8 < 0.10 for large \u2206m2 ) seem to\nexclude \u03bd\u03bc \u2194 \u03bde mixing in the region of interest, at least as a dominant mode.90\nHowever the ambiguity between oscillations to tau or sterile neutrinos is not resolved\nby the analysis of Super-Kamiokande data described previously. In order to discriminate between the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 and the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bds hypotheses, it is necessary to consider\nother physics effects able to distinguish one mode from the other. First of all, while\nthe \u03bd\u03c4 has standard neutral current interactions with matter, \u03bds does not couple to\nthe Z 0 boson, with a consequent depletion of NC events and an up-down asymmetry\nin the NC sample. Moreover, in case of mixing with a sterile neutrino, matter effects\n- see Eqs.(26), (27) and (28) - would induce a sizeable change in the oscillation probability for neutrino energies such that E/|\u2206m2 | & 103 GeV/eV2 .91 Based on those\nconsiderations, Super-Kamiokande has published an analysis of 1100 live days data,\nshowing that the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 hypothesis fits low energy CC interactions, but does not\nfit the NC sample or high energy CC data.92 Although they cannot exclude more\ncomplicated schemes in which the mixing is between \u03bd\u03bc and admixture of \u03bd\u03c4 with\na small component of \u03bds , pure \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bds is disfavoured by their data at 99% C.L..\nAnother way of testing the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bds hypothesis, which is again motivated by the \u03bds\nnot having standard electro-weak interactions, is to look for possible suppressions\nof \u03c0 0 production. This technique is currently limited by the systematic error on the\n\u03c0 0 production cross-section, but the situation should improve in the near future,\nsince the K2K experiment,93 which we shall discuss shortly, is expected to reduce\nthe uncertainty from the present value of \u223c 20% down to \u223c 5%.\n\nSuper-Kamiokande has recently presented preliminary results on \u03bd\u03c4 appearance.84\nThe experiment does not have the resolution to unambiguously identify an event as\nbeing a \u03bd\u03c4 CC interaction, however they have developed a likelihood-based analysis\nto extract a sample of tau-like events. The observed number of selected events is\n419, for an expected number of 31 \u03bd\u03c4 's plus 387 background events; moreover the\nmeasured zenith angle distribution is better fitted by \u03bd\u03c4 's plus background than by\nbackground only.\nIn summary, we have seen that Super-Kamiokande results, which have been\nconfirmed with less sensitivity by other atmospheric neutrino experiments, represent\na strong hint for neutrino oscillations with near-to-maximal mixing (sin2 2\u03b8 > 0.88)\nand \u2206m2 in the range 2 \u2212 6 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 . New experiments, like ICARUS43 and\nMONOLITH,94 will study or plan to study atmospheric neutrinos in the future.\nHowever the uncertainties on the atmospheric neutrino flux predictions are such\nthat a firmer experimental proof of neutrino oscillations is required, together with a\nbetter determination of the oscillation parameters if the effect is confirmed. For this\nreason it is very important to check the atmospheric neutrino anomaly in controlled\nexperimental conditions, by using artificially produced neutrinos (i.e. accelerator\nbeams).\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n39\n\nTypical neutrino energies at accelerators are in the range \u223c 1\u221230 GeV, therefore,\nin order to match the \u2206m2 domain suggested by atmospheric neutrino results, it\nis necessary to increase the detector-to-source separation to distances of the order\nof hundreds of kilometres. Experiments of this sort are commonly referred to as\nlong-baseline experiments and we shall discuss them in the next section.\n6.4. Long-baseline Accelerator Experiments\nThe first accelerator-based long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment ever\nbuilt is K2K (KEK-to-Kamioka),93 which makes use of an almost pure \u03bd\u03bc beam\n(98.2%) directed from KEK, in Japan, to the Super-Kamiokande detector, 250 km\naway. K2K, which has been taking data since June 1999, is a disappearance experiment, aiming to measure a deficit of muon neutrinos in the far detector at Kamioka\ncompared to the initial beam intensity measured in the near detector at KEK. The\nneutrino beam, produced in the interactions of 12 GeV primary protons from the\nKEK-PS on an aluminium target, has an average energy of \u223c 1.3 GeV (hence the\nmaximum sensitivity to oscillations is for \u2206m2 \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 ). Pion and muon\ndetectors, placed along the beamline, are used to measure the secondary particles\nafter the horn focusing system and to monitor the beam centering and its intensity. The design proton intensity is 6 \u00d7 1012 protons per pulse (1.1 \u03bcs spill/2.2 s\nperiod). The results recently presented by the K2K collaboration are based on\n2.29 \u00d7 1019 pot (protons-on-target), collected between June 1999 and June 2000.\nThe alignment between the neutrino target and the far detector is performed using\na GPS survey, giving a precision better than 0.01 mrad, while the precision of the\ncivil construction is better than 0.1 mrad. GPS timing information is also used to\ncorrelate events in Super-Kamiokande with the KEK-PS spill.\nIn order to have a reliable measurement of the beam intensity at production\nand to reduce the systematic uncertainties related to the experimental technique\nadopted, the near detector has been built using the same principles and technology as for Super-Kamiokande. Located 300 m from the production point, it is a\n1 kton water-Cherenkov detector with photo-multiplier readout, the PMTs being\narranged so to provide the same coverage as for Super-Kamiokande (40%). The\nwater-Cherenkov detector is complemented by a scintillating fibre tracker (with a\n6 ton water target), a lead-glass electromagnetic calorimeter and a muon range\ndetector. The combined information from the different sub-detectors allows measurement of the \u03bd\u03bc beam profile, its energy distribution and intensity, as well as the\ndetermination the \u03bde contamination (\u223c 1.3%) and the study of neutrino interactions\nin the 1 GeV region.\nThe beam has been measured to be centred within systematic uncertainties\n(0.7 mrad) and the centre has been shown to be stable within \u00b11 mrad. The\nmuon energy and angular distributions are also monitored on a daily basis and so\nis the beam intensity: they all appear to be stable over the period of data taking\nconsidered. Given this stability, it is possible to predict the number of expected\nevents at the far site in absence of oscillations by extrapolating the normalisation\n\n\f40\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nmeasured at the near site to the far detector location. The beam simulation used\nfor the extrapolation is validated by a comparison between the predicted secondary\npion momentum and angular distributions and those measured at the pion monitor\nplaced along the beamline. The selection criteria used to identify muon-like and\nelectron-like interactions at the near detector are essentially the same as those used\nin Super-Kamiokande for the FC atmospheric neutrino analysis, with the addition\nof a cut on the total number of photoelectrons to discard spills with multiple events.\nTable 5.

K2K expected sensitivity for 1020 pot, compared with the allowed regions in the oscillation\nparameter space obtained by Super-Kamiokande, Soudan2 and MACRO (from ref.95 ).\n\nThe systematic uncertainty on the near detector flux measurement is 5%, with a\nstatistical error of < 1%. For the far detector the systematic error is 3%, while the\nuncertainty related to the near-to-far extrapolation is estimated to be +6\n\u22127 %. Other\nuncertainties, such as those on the beam spectrum and the neutrino interaction cross\nsections, are negligible to first order, due to cancellations in the near-to-far comparison. The expected number of events in absence of oscillations is 37.8\u00b10.2(stat.)+3.5\n\u22123.8 ,\nwhile only 28 have been observed in real data. In Tab.5 the predicted and observed\nnumber of events are compared for the different categories (one-ring muon-like,\none-ring electron like and multi-ring): while essentially no conclusion can be drawn\nabout electron-like events, due to the small statistics, the muon neutrino sample\nappears to be significantly depleted, a fact which might be interpreted as evidence\nfor neutrino oscillations. However, the K2K collaboration has not yet given any in-\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n41\n\nterpretation of their result and is waiting to have more statistics (1020 pot by year\n2005) and a better understanding of systematic uncertainties before drawing any\nstrong conclusion from the observed anomaly. The expected final sensitivity for K2K\nis shown in Fig.20, together with the allowed solutions obtained by Kamiokande,\nSuper-Kamiokande, MACRO and Soudan2. From that plot it becomes clear that,\nunless the actual \u2206m2 is at the high end of Super-Kamiokande allowed region, K2K\nwill not provide a definitive proof that the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is due to\nneutrino oscillations.\nTwo other long-baseline projects are expected to start operation over the next\nfew years: one in the USA, the MINOS96 experiment at Soudan, using the NuMI97\nbeam from Fermilab, and the other in Europe, using the CERN-to-Gran Sasso neutrino beam98 (NCGS) in conjunction with the two proposed experiments OPERA99\nand ICARUS/ICANOE.43,100\nThe MINOS experiment aims to investigate the atmospheric neutrino anomaly\nby measuring the neutrino beam at two different locations, one close to production\n(near detector, at Fermilab, \u223c 320 m from the production point), where no effect is\nexpected from neutrino mixing, and the other far away (far detector, in the Soudan\nmine, Ely, Minnesota, about 730 km from Fermilab), where neutrino oscillations\nwould modify the beam flavour composition and induce distortions in the measured\nenergy spectra.\n\nFig. 21. Predicted event rates at the MINOS far site for the three possible beam configurations,\ntogether with the spectrum expected for \"perfect focusing\", where all produced neutrinos reach\nthe detector.\n\nThe NuMI neutrino beam is obtained from the decay of secondary particles\nproduced in the interactions of 120 GeV protons, delivered by the new Fermilab\nMain Injector, with a carbon target. The expected proton flux is 4 \u00d7 1013 protons\nper pulse, with repetition rate 1.9 s and spill duration time 10 \u03bcs. The secondary\nmesons are focused by two parabolic horns and allowed to decay in a 675 m long\ndecay tunnel. The relative distance between the two magnetic elements can be\nchanged by moving the second horn with respect to the other: by adjusting the\n\n\f42\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nhorn positions and currents it is then possible to select different regions of the phase\nspace, thus providing the flexibility to optimize the beam energy during the course\nof the experiment. Three beam settings are possible (see Fig.21) , corresponding to\nthree different energy regimes: low (< E\u03bd >\u223c 3 GeV), medium (< E\u03bd >\u223c 7 GeV)\nand high (< E\u03bd >\u223c 15 GeV) energy. In order to have optimal sensitivity in the\nlow part of the atmospheric neutrinos allowed region, which seems to be preferred\nby Super-Kamiokande data, MINOS has decided to start taking data with the lowenergy beam configuration. Another focusing system is under consideration and\nmight be included in the final design of the NuMI beam, the so-called hadron hose.\nThe basic idea is to have a wire carrying a 1 kA current down the centre of the\ndecay tunnel, to provide additional focusing for the charged secondary mesons, with\nthe double advantage of increasing the beam intensity and reducing the systematic\nuncertainties on the beam extrapolation from the near to the far site.\nIn order to minimize the impact of systematic uncertainties, MINOS far and\nnear detectors (5.4 kton and 980 ton mass respectively) have been designed to be as\nsimilar as possible. They are both magnetised iron-scintillator sampling calorimeters with photo-multiplier readout. The average toroidal magnetic field in the iron\nis about 1.3 T. The longitudinal and transverse granularity is the same for the\ntwo detectors: 2.54 cm thick octagonal iron plates are alternated with scintillator\nplanes, made of plastic slabs with 1 \u00d7 4 cm2 transverse section and lengths varying\nbetween 4 m and 8 m for the far detector planes. The slabs orientation on successive\nplanes differs by 900 , so to provide two coordinate measurements on the transverse\nplane. A green wave-length shifting fibre, 1.2 mm diameter, is glued into a grove\nat the centre of the wide side of each slab: the light produced in the scintillator is\ntrapped into the fibre, shifted in frequency and then routed to multi-pixel PMTsl\nthrough a clear fibre, optically connected to the wave-length shifting one. The readout is two-sided at the far detector and one-sided at the near detector. While the\nfar detector planes are all fully equipped with scintillator strips, the near detector\nwill be only partially instrumented. In the forward part (the first 120 plates, out\nof a total of 180), which logically defines the target and calorimeter sections, only\nevery fifth plane is fully instrumented, while 4/5 of the plates are instrumented in\na limited region around the beam fiducial area. In the remaining section, the muon\nspectrometer, every fifth plane is fully instrumented.\nA calibration detector, much smaller in size but with the same longitudinal\nsegmentation as the MINOS far and near detectors, is being tested at the CERN\nPS,101 to characterize its response to muons, hadrons and electrons and to study\nthe performances of the different hardware components used by MINOS.\nThe main physics goals of MINOS, which is expected to start taking data in\n2004, are to test the neutrino oscillations hypothesis, to verify that the dominant\nmode is \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 , as suggested by Super-Kamiokande data, and to measure the\nl 16-pixel\n\nPMTs are used at the far detector, where the signal is optically multiplexed, while at\nthe near detector 64-pixel PMTs have been chosen and multiplexing is applied only in the muon\nspectrometer section.\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n43\n\noscillation parameters with a precision of about 10%. Moreover the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bds and\n\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde channels will also be investigated.\nThe criterion envisaged by MINOS to verify the oscillations hypothesis is the\nso-called T-test, based on the parameter:102\nT =\n\nN1\u03bc\nN1\u03bc + N0\u03bc\n\n(49)\n\nwhere N1\u03bc and N0\u03bc are the number of muon-like and muon-less events respectively.\nIf \u03bd\u03bc 's oscillate to another active neutrino species, say \u03bd\u03c4 's, the muon-like sample\nwill be depleted (disappearance of \u03bd\u03bc ) and the measured N1\u03bc in the far detector\nwill be less than that expected in the absence of oscillations; on the other hand,\n\u03bd\u03c4 CC events will look very much like neutral current interactions and, for neutrino\nenergies above the \u03c4 production threshold, will populate the muon-less sample,\nso that the total number of events will remain unchanged. Therefore, \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4\noscillations would manifest themselves as a low TF AR /TN EAR ratio with respect to\nexpectations in absence of oscillations. If the \u03bd\u03bc 's oscillated to sterile neutrinos, the\nmuon-like and the muon-less samples would be depleted in the same manner, since\nsterile neutrinos do not couple with any of the weak interactions mediating bosons.\nTherefore for pure \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bds oscillations the ratio TF AR /TN EAR would be the same\nas for the no-oscillations case. However, the NC sample would also be affected by\noscillations to sterile neutrinos, which would induce a reduction in the number of\nneutral current interactions and a distortion of the NC energy spectrum: if none of\nthose effects is measurable, a limit can be set on the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bds oscillation amplitude.\n\nFig. 22. (Top) Energy distributions at the MINOS far detector, in absence of oscillations (solid\nline) and as would be measured for different values of \u2206m2 and sin2 2\u03b8 = 0.9. (Bottom) The\nratio between the oscillated and the unoscillated spectra shows the characteristic dip shape, at an\nenergy determined by the value of \u2206m2 and whose depth depends on the oscillation amplitude.\n\nIf the oscillation hypothesis is confirmed by the T-test, assuming the dominant\noscillation mode is \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 , the oscillation parameters can be extracted by com-\n\n\f44\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nparing the \u03bd\u03bc CC energy spectrum measured in the far detector to expectations in\nabsence oscillations as obtained from the measured spectrum in the near detector.\nWhen considering the ratio between the two distributions (see Fig.22103 ), a very\ncharacteristic dip appears, at an energy corresponding to the oscillation \u2206m2 and\nwhose depth is determined by the oscillation amplitude sin2 2\u03b8.\n\nFig. 23. (Left) MINOS sensitivity at 90% C.L. for \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 as obtained from the T-test; results\nare shown for 10kton \u00d7 year and all three possible beam configurations.(Right) 90% C.L. allowed\nregions from fits to reconstructed CC energy distribution, for sin2 2\u03b8 = 0.9 and different values of\n\u2206m2 ; results are shown for the low-energy beam only.\n\nIf no oscillation signal is found, the 90% C.L. limits which MINOS would extract from the T-test analysis, based on 10 kton \u00d7 year of data, are shown in\nFig.23 (left),103 together with the allowed regions obtained by Kamiokande and\nSuper-Kamiokande. Using the low-energy beam, then, MINOS will cover the entire\nparameter space suggested by the atmospheric neutrino results. On the other hand,\nif an oscillation signal is observed, a measurement of the oscillation parameters can\nbe performed. MINOS sensitivity to the oscillation parameters, as obtained from\nthe far-to-near comparison of the \u03bd\u03bc CC energy spectrum for 10 kton\u00d7year, is shown\nin Fig.23 (right),103 for sin2 2\u03b8 = 0.9 and \u2206m2 varying between 0.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 and\n0.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 : as expected, the higher the value of \u2206m2 , the better the precision\nto which the parameters can be determined.\nMINOS also plan to study atmospheric neutrinos and preliminary results, based\non a 18 kton \u00d7 year sample of simulated events, show that the experiment has the\nsensitivity to check the atmospheric neutrino anomaly in the range of parameters\nsuggested by Super-Kamiokande, with completely different systematics.104\nIntense efforts have been recently made within the MINOS collaboration to\noptimize the experiment capabilities for detection of a \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde signal. The main\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n45\n\ndifference with respect to the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 search is that in case of oscillations to \u03bde an\nappearance analysis has to be performed, looking for an excess of events in the far\ndetector, above the expected background from prompt \u03bde CC interactions and NC\nevents with a topology similar to that of \u03bde CC. The prompt \u03bde contamination in the\n\u03bd\u03bc beam is quite small, of the order of 0.6 \u2212 2%, depending on beam configuration.\nThe systematic uncertainties on background predictions in the far detector should\nbe drastically reduced by the measurements of the same background events in the\nnear detector. Moreover results from hadron-production experiment should help to\nreduce the systematic error on beam predictions. Preliminary results105 show that,\nif the total error can be kept within 10%, MINOS should be able to improve the\nCHOOZ88 limit on |Ue3 |2 by about a factor two.m\nThe CERN-to-Gran Sasso program is based on a completely different strategy\nthan that of NuMI-to-Soudan. Instead of measuring the disappearance of muon\nneutrinos at the far location and extracting the oscillation parameters from the\ncharacteristic pattern induced by oscillations in the neutrino energy distribution,\nthey have decided to go for direct detection (appearance) of tau neutrinos in an\nalmost pure \u03bd\u03bc beam. The two approaches should be regarded as complementary\nand equally valuable, especially in a field where redundancy is a requirement rather\nthan a choice.\n\nFig. 24. CNGS \u03bd\u03bc flux at the Gran Sasso site.\n\nCNGS is a wide-band neutrino beam of relatively high energy (< E(\u03bd\u03bc CC) >\u223c\n20 GeV, see Fig.24), which has been optimised to maximize the number of \u03bd\u03c4 CC\nevents for appearance experiments at Gran Sasso. It is expected to be commissioned\nby May 2005. The beam design benefits from the experience gained at CERN with\nthe West Area Neutrino Beam (WANF), in most recent times used by the shortbaseline experiments NOMAD106 and CHORUS.107 Primary protons of 400 GeV\nare extracted from the CERN-SPS and let interact with a graphite target, where\nsecondary particles, mostly pions and kaons, are produced.

The expected proton intensity\nis of 4.5 \u00d7 1019 pot/year. The \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e contamination is very low (in terms\nof CC interactions: \u223c 2%, \u223c 0.8% and 0.05% respectively), while the prompt \u03bd\u03c4\ncontamination (O(10\u22126 )) is essentially negligible for the purposes of \u03bd\u03c4 appearance\nexperiments. Since the baseline is fixed (about 730 km between the production\npoint at CERN and the Gran Sasso Laboratory), the low value of the \u2206m2 suggested by atmospheric neutrino experiments would require operation at the lowest\nenergy possible; on the other hand, neutrinos must be energetic enough to produce\ncharged tau leptons in charged current interactions. A compromise between these\ntwo competing requirements is achieved by adjusting the settings of the beam focusing system. The expected number of \u03bd\u03c4 CC events at Gran Sasso per kton per\nyear are given in Tab.6 (from ref.100 ).\nTable 6. Expected number of \u03bd\u03c4 charged current interactions for an isoscalar target at Gran Sasso,\nfor sin2 2\u03b8 = 1 and different values of \u2206m2 , assuming 4.5 \u00d7 1019 pot/year (from ref.100 ).

Emulsions are used as high\nprecision trackers rather than as the active target. The OPERA design, which\nlargely benefits from the experience acquired with the CHORUS107 and DONUT10\nexperiments, is an evolution of the Emulsion Cloud Chamber (ECC) technique,\nwhere the high-precision tracking capabilities of emulsions are integrated with a\npassive material to provide a large target mass. In the OPERA baseline design, an\nECC cell consists of a 1 mm thick lead plate followed by a thin film, made of two\n50 \u03bcm thick emulsion layers separated by a 200 \u03bcm plastic base. The basic detector\nunit is obtained by stacking 56 cells to form a compact brick (10.2 \u00d7 12.7 \u00d7 cm2\ntransverse section, 10 X0 length, 8.3 kg weight), which can in turn be assembled\ninto walls. An additional emulsion film is placed in front of the first lead plate,\nto improve the track matching with the upstream wall, while another film, the socalled Special Sheet, separated from the most downstream cell by a 2 mm plastic\nplate, is used to have good \u03c4 detection efficiency also for events occurring in the\nlast lead plate. After each wall, an electronic tracking detector is used to select\nthe brick where the neutrino interaction occurs. In the baseline design the tracking\ndetector in the target section follows very closely that of MINOS, with scintillator\nstrips coupled to wave-length shifting fibres and multi-anode PMT readout, where\nthe selected PMTs are the same as those used in MINOS near detector. A wall\nof bricks and two planes of electronic detectors constitute one OPERA module,\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n47\n\nwhose structure is then repeated 24 times to form a supermodule, also including\na downstream muon spectrometer. Each muon spectrometer consists of a dipolar\nmagnet (1.55 T in the tracking region), made of two vertical walls of iron layers,\ninterleaved with RPC detectors, and of drift tubes, placed in front and behind the\nmagnet as well as between the two walls. Three supermodules form the full OPERA\ndetector, for a total target mass of about 1.8 kton.\nThe data from the electronic detectors, which will be analysed quasi-online, are\nused to select bricks where neutrino interactions occur and which have to be removed\nby an automated system. Additional bricks might need to be removed for a complete\nreconstruction of the interesting events. Events selected as \u03c4 candidates will then\nbe sent to dedicated scanning stations, where further studies can be performed to\nachieve the required background suppression. The expected rate of \u03bd\u03bc CC events is\nof about 30 events per day.\nThe \u03c4 decay channels considered by OPERA are listed in Tab.7, together with\nthe corresponding \u03bd\u03c4 detection efficiencies and the expected number of background\neventsn per year. New studies are underway to improve the experiment sensitivity\nby adding also the \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c1\u03bd channel (23.5% B.R.) to the decay modes considered.\nThe expected number of \u03c4 events per year is given in Tab.8 as a function of possible\nvalues of \u2206m2 .\nTable 7.

ICARUS is a\nliquid-Argon TPC which allows event reconstruction in three dimensions, combining\nhigh spatial resolution with excellent particle identification capabilities and precise\nhomogeneous calorimetry. ICARUS has been conceived as a multi-purpose experiment with a very wide physics program, which goes from proton decay searches to\nthe study of solar and atmospheric neutrinos as well as of supernova neutrinos and,\nof course, of artificially produced neutrinos from CERN.\nThe final phase of ICARUS foresees a detector with a sensitive mass of at least\n5 kton, but a step-wise strategy has been adopted to demonstrate the technical\nfeasibility of such a challenging project. The first large-scale prototype had a volume\nof 1, 000m3 (15 ton) and was built as a test-bench for the cryogenic system, the\ninternal detector mechanics and the liquid-Argon purification. The 15 ton prototype\nwas successfully tested between 1997 and 1999. The next step towards the fullscale detector is the T600 module,110 which is now being commissioned at Pavia\nand which will be transported to the Gran Sasso Laboratory tunnel as soon as the\ntechnical tests are complete. In 1999 a proposal was submitted for the ICANOE\nexperiment,100 which combined the ICARUS technology with a fine-grained iron\ncalorimeter developed by the NOE collaboration.111\nBecause of the high resolution on the event kinematic variables, ICANOE could\nsearch for \u03bd\u03c4 appearance in the NCGS beam using kinematic selection criteria,\n\n\fEvents/20kton x year\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n49\n\n40\n\n\u03bde + \u03bd\u03c4 CC\n\u03bde CC\n\u03bd\u03c4 CC\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nEvisible (GeV)\n\nFig. 26.

Both the background from the prompt \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e in the beam (hatched histogram) and\nthe events from \u03c4 \u2192 e decays (dashed line) have been considered. Errors are only statistical.\n\na strategy which has been successfully applied by the short-baseline experiment\nNOMAD.112 For ICANOE, as for NOMAD, the \u03c4 \u2192 e decay mode represents a\ngolden channel. After four years of running with intensity 4.5 \u00d7 1019 pot/year, the\nexpected number of \u03bd\u03c4 CC events followed by a \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03bd \u03bd\u0304 decay would be about 110\nfor \u2206m2 = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 , while the total expected number of background events\nfrom prompt \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304e is about 470. This means that an excess of events should\nbe measured in the visible energy distribution even before applying any kinematic\ncut (see Fig.26).\nThe excellent electron identification in ICANOE would also allow a search for\n\u03bde appearance from \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde oscillations. Selection criteria based on kinematic\nvariables could be used to discriminate between events from \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde and events\nfrom \u03c4 \u2192 e decays. Assuming \u2206m223 = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 and \u03b823 = 450 , the statistical\nsignificance for a \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde signal (after four years of running with intensity 4.5 \u00d7\n1019 pot/year) varies between 0.8 \u03c3 and 6.8 \u03c3 for 30 < \u03b813 < 90 .113\nIn summer 2000 the ICANOE collaboration ceased to exist as such, but it is likely\nthat as soon as the successful operation of the T600 module is demonstrated, an\nupdated version of the proposal will be submitted to the relevant organisations.114\nUntil now we have discussed the experimental hints for neutrino oscillations\ncoming from the study of naturally produced neutrinos and we have described the\nexperimental program which, in the near future, should clarify many of the open\nissues concerning the solar and the atmospheric neutrino anomalies. There is a\nthird hint for neutrino oscillations, which has the peculiarity of being the only one\ncoming from an accelerator experiment and the only one to represent evidence for\nneutrino oscillations in the appearance mode. This is the so-called LSND effect,\nwhich we shall discuss in the next section.\n\n\f50\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n7. The LSND Effect\nThe LSND experiment115 at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF),\nNew Mexico, USA, was originally designed to search for \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e oscillations using\n\u03bd\u0304\u03bc from \u03bc+ decay at rest (DAR). In 1995 LSND reported an excess of electronlike events above background and gave an interpretation of that result in terms\nof neutrino oscillations.116 The effect was later confirmed by an improved analysis\nwith larger statistics, both in DAR \u03bd\u0304\u03bc 's117 and in the \u03bd\u03bc sample from \u03c0 + decay\nin flight (DIF).118 In the following we shall discuss the results reported in a recent\npaper of the LSND collaboration,119 where DAR and DIF events are treated in the\nsame way, in a unified analysis of the two samples.\nThe neutrino beam used by LSND was obtained from the decay of the secondary\nparticles, mostly \u03c0 + with a small fraction of \u03c0 \u2212 (N\u03c0\u2212 /N\u03c0+ \u223c 1/8), produced in the\ninteraction of an intense (\u223c 1 mA) 798 MeV proton beam with the primary target.\nThe decay chains leading to the production of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are:\n\u03c0 + \u2192\u03bc+ \u03bd\u03bc\n\n+\n\n\u0592\u2192 e \u03bde \u03bd\u0304\u03bc\n\n(50)\n(51)\n\nand the charge-symmetric sequence:\n\u03c0 \u2212 \u2192\u03bc\u2212 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0592\u2192 e \u03bd\u0304e \u03bd\u03bc .\n\n(52)\n(53)\n\nThe fractions of \u03c0 + DAR and DIF are 96.6% and 3.4% of the total respectively.\nWhile only \u223c 0.05% of the positive muons produced in (50) decay in flight, most of\nthem stop before decaying and then give a standard Michel spectrum for \u03bde and \u03bd\u0304\u03bc\n(Emax (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) = m\u03bc /2 = 52.8 MeV). About 95% of the \u03c0 \u2212 's are stopped in the target\nand immediately captured, while the remaining 5% decay in flight; moreover, about\n88% of the muons from the \u03c0 \u2212 DIF are captured from atomic orbit. In conclusion\na suppression of the order of \u223c 1/8 \u00d7 0.05 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 0.88) = 7.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 is expected\nfor the relative flux of prompt \u03bd\u0304e 's, which constitute a background for the \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e\noscillation search. The \u03bde flux from \u03bc+ and \u03c0 + DIF, representing a background for\nthe \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde oscillation search, is suppressed by the long muon lifetime and by the\nsmall \u03c0 + \u2192 e+ \u03bde branching ratio (1.23 \u00d7 10\u22124 ).\nIn 1996 the production target, which was made of water during the running\nperiod 1993-1995, was upgraded: two upstream targets, used to provide beam to\nother experiments, were removed and the water production target was replaced by\ntungsten. This resulted in a reduction of the DAR flux per pot and of the DIF flux\nper pot by 27% and 34% respectively.\nThe estimated systematic uncertainty on the beam predictions is 7% for \u03bc+\nfluxes and 15% for \u03c0 \u00b1 DIF and \u03bc\u2212 DAR fluxes.\nThe LSND detector was an approximately cylindrical tank (8.3 m long, 5.7 m\ndiameter), located 30 m downstream from the neutrino source (sensitivity to \u2206m2 \u223c\n0.1\u22121 eV2 ) and filled with 167 tons of mineral oil doped with scintillator (0.031 g/liter\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n51\n\nof butyl-PBD). Because of the low scintillator concentration, both scintillation and\nCherenkov light could be detected by the 1220 photo-multiplier installed on the\ninside surface of the tank (25% coverage). The Cherenkov cone and the time distribution of the light were used to tag electron events and to measure the event vertex\nand the e\u00b1 direction. For any PMT activity above threshold, the pulse height, a\ndigitised time and the event position were recorded, so that energy measurements\nand space and time correlation were possible. On all sides except the bottom the\ndetector was surrounded by an active shield (scintillator plus lead), providing a veto\nsystem against charged particles (10\u22125 inefficiency). Triggers were not required to\nbe in-spill, but the beam state was recorded by the data acquisition and a beamon/beam-off comparison was used to perform a statistical subtraction of the residual\ncosmic ray background.\nThe identification of \u03bd\u0304e events in LSND is based on the detection of quasi-elastic\nscattering:\n\u03bd\u0304e + p \u2192 e+ + n\n\n(54)\n\nfollowed by the neutron capture process:\nn + p \u2192 d + \u03b3(2.2 MeV)\n\n(55)\n\nTherefore the \u03bd\u0304e signature in LSND is a delayed coincidence between an electron\nsignal and a spatially correlated 2.2 MeV photon.\nElectron neutrinos are identified in LSND via the inclusive charged-current reaction:\n\u03bde C \u2192 e \u2212 X .\n\n(56)\n\nAlthough the primary electron selection criteria have been optimize for the DAR\nanalysis, the same cuts are used to select also electrons for the DIF analysis. The\nelectron energy range defined for the \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e search is 20 < Ee < 60 MeV, while\nevents with 60 < Ee < 200 MeV are used for the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde analysis. The cut at\n20 MeV rejects the background events from the \u03b2-decay of 12 B produced in the\ncapture of cosmic \u03bc\u2212 on 12 C, while events above 200 MeV are removed to suppress\nthe beam-related background from \u03c0 + \u2192 e+ \u03bde , which at those energies becomes\nlarger that any possible oscillation signal. Cosmic ray events are further suppressed\nby using the veto information and by removing electron events with additional\nactivity within 8 \u03bcs before the electron signal or 12 \u03bcs after it. Discrimination\nbetween correlated 2.2 MeV photons from neutron capture and accidental \u03b3's from\nradioactivity is achieved by means of a likelihood function, R\u03b3 , which depends on\nthe number of PMT hits, the distance between the reconstructed \u03b3 and e+ positions\nand the time interval between the \u03b3 and the e+ events. The discrimination power of\nR\u03b3 has been checked by using \u03bde C \u2192 e\u2212 Ng.s. exclusive interactions, where no recoil\nneutron is present and which should therefore exhibit an R\u03b3 distribution consistent\nwith that expected for purely accidental \u03b3's.\n\n\f52\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nThe two largest backgrounds to the \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e signal are \u03bd\u0304e CC interactions from\nprompt \u03bd\u0304e in the beam, which are identical to the signal events, or \u03bd\u03bc (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc )CC interactions with a correlated neutron signal and the muon misidentified as a positron.\nBoth backgrounds have been estimated by using the experiment Monte Carlo simulation and, whenever possible, by means of control samples from real data.\nFor the entire period 1993-1998 of data-taking, LSND observed a beam on-off\nexcess of 117.9\u00b122.4 events in the DAR channel. The corresponding expected number of background events from \u03bc\u2212 DAR followed by \u03bd\u0304e p \u2192 e+ n scattering and from\n\u03c0 \u2212 DIF followed by \u03bd\u0304\u03bc p \u2192 \u03bc+ n scattering are 19.5 \u00b1 3.9 and 10.5 \u00b1 4.6 respectively,\nleading to a total excess of 87.9\u00b122.4\u00b16.0 events above background expectations.119\nThe number of expected \u03bd\u0304e events from \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e oscillations with 100% probability\nis 33000\u00b13300, the error being a combination of the systematic uncertainties on the\nneutrino flux (7%) and on the e+ efficiency (7%). The result then corresponds to an\noscillation probability of (0.264 \u00b1 0.067(stat.) \u00b1 0.045(sys.))%, 119 to be compared\nwith the previously published result of (0.31 \u00b1 0.12(stat.) \u00b1 0.05(sys.))%, 117 which\nwas based on the 1993-1995 data sample.\nThe new DIF \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde oscillation analysis gives a beam on-off excess of 14.7\u00b112.2\nevents. The estimated total background from the \u03bc+ \u2192 e+ \u03bde \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , \u03c0 + \u2192 e+ and\n\u03bde \u2192 \u03bde processes is of 6.6\u00b11.7 \u03bde events, resulting in a total excess of 8.1\u00b112.2\u00b11.7\nevents above background expectations. The number of events expected for \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde\noscillation with 100% probability is 7800, thus giving an oscillation probability of\n(0.10 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b1 0.04)%.119 This has to be compared with the result obtained from the\n1993-1995 data analysis, which gave a probability of (0.26 \u00b1 0.10 \u00b1 0.05)%.118 Using\nthe result from the DAR analysis and assuming that CP is conserved, the expected\noscillation probability in the DIF sample is \u223c 0.26% at high \u2206m2 and \u223c 0.05% at\nlow \u2206m2 .119\nA likelihood fit of the beam-on events which pass their oscillation cuts is used\nto extract the LSND allowed region in the sin2 2\u03b8, \u2206m2 plane. The fit is performed\nover the entire electron range 20 \u2212 200 MeV, so that both DAR and DIF events\nare considered at the same time. The probability density functions which define\nthe likelihood function L used in the fit depend on the electron energy, the electron\nlongitudinal position along the tank, the cosine of the reconstructed angle between\nthe neutrino and the electron direction, the likelihood ratio R\u03b3 for correlated \u03b3\nselection. To account for the limited knowledge of the background, its contribution\nto L is allowed to vary with gaussian profile around the expected central value.o\nThe result obtained is shown in Fig.27, where the LSND allowed region is compared with limits obtained by other experiments sensitive to \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e )\noscillations in different regions of the parameter space.120,121,122,123 In particular it\nis interesting to briefly discuss the null result obtained by the KARMEN2 collaboration, which has conducted a search for \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e oscillations in approximately the\nsame region of the parameter space as that investigated by LSND.\no beam-related\n\nbackground are locked to vary together, while beam-unrelated backgrounds can\nfluctuate independently.\n\n\f53\n\n2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u2206m (eV /c )\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n10 2\n\n10\n\nKarmen\nBugey\n\nCCFR\n\n1\n\nNOMAD\n10\n\n-1\n\n90% (Lmax-L < 2.3)\n99% (Lmax-L < 4.6)\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n1\n2\nsin 2\u03b8\n\nFig. 27. Allowed region obtained by LSND from a combined fit of the \u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e and \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde\nsamples (from ref.119 ; blue is 90% C.L., yellow is 99% C.L.).\n\nThe KARMEN2 experiment was performed at the ISIS neutron spallation facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Chilton, Didcot, United Kingdom. As\nat LAMPF, neutrinos are obtained from the decay at rest or in flight of secondary\nparticles produced in the interactions of 800 MeV primary protons with a massive\nbeam stop target. Also in this case the \u03bd\u03bc 's from \u03c0 + decays are monoenergetic\n(E\u03bd\u03bc = 29.8 MeV), while both \u03bde 's and \u03bd\u0304\u03bc 's have continuous energy spectra extending up to 52.8 MeV. One difference between the two beams is that the one at\nISIS has a well defined time structure: two very short (\u223c 100 ns) proton pulses,\nseparated by 225 ns, are produced with a repetition rate of 50 Hz. Because of the\ndifferent lifetimes of their parent particles (\u03c4\u03c0 = 26 ns, \u03c4\u03bc = 2.2 \u03bcs), the \u03bd\u03bc -burst,\nwhich occurs essentially in coincidence with the proton pulses, can be clearly separated from the \u03bde - and \u03bd\u0304\u03bc -induced events, which are instead characterised by a\nmuch longer decay constant. Due to the accelerator duty cycle of 10\u22125 (to be compared with the 6\u00d710\u22122 duty factor for LSND), the cosmic ray background is largely\nsuppressed with respect to the beam-related events. The proton beam intensity at\nISIS is 0.2 mA, that is to say a factor of five lower than at LAMPF.\nThe KARMEN detector,124 located 17.5 m downstream the neutrino source\n(about half the LSND baseline), consisted of a rectangular tank filled with 56 t\nliquid scintillator. The tank was segmented into 512 optically independent modules,\nwrapped with Gd2 O3 coated paper to increase the efficiency for the neutron capture\nprocess. The event position was obtained from the time of the PMT signal at the two\nends of the hit module. Shielding against the beam-related neutron background and\nthe cosmic ray background was provided by a 7 kton steel blockhouse combined with\na system of two layers of veto counters. Moreover an additional veto counter, added\nin 1996 for the KARMEN2 upgrade, was used to largely suppress the background\nfrom energetic neutrons produced in \u03bd\u03bc CC DIS interactions.\nThe \u03bd\u0304e detection in KARMEN2 was based on the delayed coincidence between\nthe positron signal from reaction (54) and either the 2.2 MeV photon of reaction\n\n\f54\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n(55) or the 8 MeV integrated photon signal from Gd de-excitation following neutron\ncapture on gadolinium. No particle identification was performed and the tagging\nof the positron event, which was expected within 2.2 \u03bcs after the beam-on-target\nsignal, relied on the beam time structure alone. Both time and spatial correlation\nbetween the positron and the neutron capture events were required. An analysis\nof the data collected between February 1997 and March 2000 shows that 11 events\nhave been identified as \u03bd\u0304e interactions, with an expected backgroundp of 12.3 \u00b1 0.6\nevents.120 Therefore the KARMEN2 result is compatible with the no-oscillation\nhypothesis and the corresponding exclusion plot at 90% C.L. is shown in Fig.27.\nCombining the LSND result with those obtained by all the other experiments\nwhich, having studied the same transition, have obtained null results, only a small\nportion of the LSND solutions is still allowed to explain the experiment anomaly\nin terms of neutrino oscillation. In particular, the skeptical reader may find the\nLSND and KARMEN2 results quite contradictory. However it has to be stressed\nthat the two experiments have sensitivities which peak at slightly different values\nof \u2206m2 . Moreover, before any definitive conclusion can be drawn from the various\nresults, a combined analysis of all experimental data should be performed. This has\nbeen tried for LSND and KARMEN, but only on subset of the collected data.125\nIn conclusion it is fair to say that no definitive answer has yet been given to the\nLSND puzzle and that more experimental data is needed.\nThe MiniBOONE experiment,126 which is now being built at Fermilab, will\naddress the LSND effect by searching for \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde oscillations in the same region\nof parameter space. An almost pure \u03bd\u03bc beam (\u03bde contamination < 0.3%), with\nenergy in the range 0.5 \u2212 1 GeV, will be obtained from the decay of secondary\nparticles produced in the interactions of 8 GeV protons with a beryllium target\npositioned in a magnetic horn. The protons will be delivered by the Fermilab\nBooster, with an expected intensity of 5 \u00d7 1020 pot per year. The decay length for\nthe positively charged secondary mesons, which are focused by the single horn, can\nbe changed from 50 m to 25 m by inserting an intermediate absorber inside the\ndecay tunnel, thus allowing a systematic study of the prompt \u03bde contamination of\nthe beam. The MiniBOONE detector will be located about 500 m from the neutrino\nproduction point, so that the E/L ratio will be approximately the same as LSND's.\nMiniBOONE will consists of a spherical tank (12.2 m diameter) filled with 800 tons\nof pure mineral oil. The Cherenkov light produced in neutrino interactions in the\ninner part of the detector (445 ton fiducial volume), as well as the modest amount\nof scintillation light from intrinsic impurities in the oil, will be detected by 1280\nPMTs (10% coverage) installed on a support structure in the tank. This structure\nwill also serve as an optical insulator for the inner part of the detector, while the\nouter 35 cm thick oil layer, read out by 280 additional PMTs, can be used as a veto\nsystem.\nThe main background components will be due to the \u03bde contamination in the\np\n\n12\n\nBackground events come from cosmic muon interactions, \u03bde12 C \u2192 e\u2212 Ng.s. sequences, prompt\n\u03bd\u0304e contamination in the beam and neutrino-induced accidental coincidences.\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n55\n\nbeam and to the misidentification of muons and \u03c0 0 as electrons.q The estimated\nsystematic uncertainties on the \u03bde flux is about 5% for the neutrino component\noriginating from the \u03c0 + \u2192 \u03bc+ \u2192 \u03bde chain and 10% for \u03bde 's coming from Ke3\ndecays of secondary K + and KL0 . Particle identification will be performed using\nthe sharpness of the Cherenkov rings and the ratio between the amount of prompt\n(Cherenkov) and late (scintillation) light, which is different for electrons and muons.\nThe misidentification uncertainty is expected to be less than 5% for muons and\nabout 5% for neutral pions: in the case of muons, the the systematic error can be\nestimated using a sample of muon decays from real data, while for \u03c0 0 's it will be\nobtained from a Monte Carlo simulation, which can in turn be constrained using\nreconstructed \u03c0 0 's from real data.\n\nFig. 28. Final 90% C.L. expected sensitivity for MiniBOONE (figure from ref.127 ). Different beam\nconfigurations and cut efficiencies have been considered.\n\nIf oscillations occur with parameters compatible with LSND solutions, after one\nyear of running MiniBOONE should observe an excess of \u223c 1500 \u03bde events above\nbackground expectations, with a significance of \u223c 8 \u2212 10\u03c3. On the other hand,\nin case of null result, after two years of running MiniBOONE should be able to\ncompletely exclude the entire LSND allowed region at 90% C.L. (see Fig.28).\n8. Neutrino Masses and Global Analysis of Neutrino Oscillation Data\nIf we believe that all experimental hints on neutrino oscillations are correct and\nwe accept that they are all manifestations of flavour mixing in the lepton sector,\nwe are forced to introduce at least another neutrino species in our framework. In\nfact, the \u2206m2 regimes suggested by the the solar neutrino deficit, the atmospheric\nneutrino anomaly and the LSND effect are all well disconnected one from the other:\n\nq\n\n\u2206m2\u2299 \u226a \u2206m2atm \u226a \u2206m2LSN D .\n\n(57)\n\nGiven the higher neutrino energy with respect to LSND, neutrons will not constitute a significant\nbackground for MiniBOONE\n\n\f56\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nOn the other hand, only two independent values of \u2206m2 are possible for three\ndifferent neutrino masses (\u2206m231 = \u2206m232 + \u2206m221 ). Therefore, recalling the LEP\nresult on the number of active neutrinos,6 in order to accommodate all experimental\nresults, an additional sterile neutrino would be required.\nWhile both the solar and the atmospheric neutrino deficit have been confirmed\nby more than one experiment, using different experimental techniques, no other\nexperiment has confirmed LSND observations. For this reason, given also the enormous impact that accepting the LSND result would have on our understanding of\nsub-nuclear phenomena, with the introduction of a light sterile neutrino, there is\na tendency in the scientific community to adopt a \"conservative\" attitude and to\nexclude LSND from most phenomenogical models and fits to neutrino oscillation\nparameters, until more solid experimental data become available. In the following\nwe shall take the same approach and discuss some of the results obtained from threeneutrino analyses of the neutrino oscillation data, while only briefly commenting on\nthe possibility to have a fourth neutrino.\nNeglecting possible CP violation phases, which are anyhow not accessible to\npresent experiments, the lepton mixing matrix (13) depends only on five parameters, two \u2206m2 and three mixing angles, four of which can be identified with the\nparameters measured by solar and atmospheric experiments:\n\u2206m2\u2299 \u2261 \u2206m221\n\n\u2206m2atm \u2261 \u2206m232\n\n(58)\n\n\u03b8\u2299 \u2261 \u03b812\n\n\u03b8atm \u2261 \u03b823\n\nwhile a limit on the fifth, \u03b813 , is set by the CHOOZ reactor experiment.\nThe hierarchy \u2206m2\u2299 \u226a \u2206m2atm implies that one of the three mass eigenstates,\nsay \u03bd3 , is separated by a larger gap |\u2206m231 | \u2248 |\u2206m232 | \u2248 \u2206m2atm \u223c 10\u22123 eV2 from\nthe other two, \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 , which are instead quasi-degenerate, being separated by\n|\u2206m221 | \u2248 \u2206m2\u2299 . 10\u22124 eV2 . However, since oscillations determine only mass\nsplittings and not the absolute value of the masses, it is still possible to shift the\nabsolute mass scale without affecting the oscillation phenomenology. Although different mass orderings are possible, here we consider the normal hierarchical scheme,\ncorresponding to:\nm1 < m2 \u226a m3\n\n(59)\n\n\u2206m221 \u226a \u2206m232 \u2248 \u2206m231 .\n\n(60)\n\nand thus:\n\nIt can be shown that, given the strong hierarchical constraint \u2206m2\u2299 \u226a \u2206m2atm ,\nthe solar neutrino data can be described in terms of only three parameters, \u2206m221 ,\n\u03b812 and \u03b813 , while the atmospheric neutrino data can be analysed in terms of \u2206m232 ,\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n57\n\n\u03b823 and \u03b813 . For the CHOOZ data, the survival probability depends only on \u03b813\nand \u2206m232 . Thus \u03b813 is the only parameter common to the three data sets. In\nparticular, in the limit \u03b813 = 0 atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation can be\ndescribed by two independent two-flavour oscillation analyses.\nSeveral analyses of the available data have been performed in the three-neutrino\nscheme:90,128 in the following we shall refer to the results presented in ref.90 . In\nparticular it will be interesting to see how the inclusion of different data in the fit\naffects the constraint which can be extracted on the mixing angle \u03b813 .\nThe three-dimensional analysis of ref.90 of the solar neutrino data has shown\nthat solutions with small values of the mixing angle \u03b813 are preferred, the most\nfavourable scenario being that of two-flavour mixing (\u03b813 = 0). The upper limit\nwhich can be extracted on the mixing angle based on solar neutrino data only is\ntan2 \u03b813 < 2.4 (\u03b813 < 570 ) at 90% C.L..\nIf only atmospheric neutrinos are considered, the analysis favours the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4\noscillation hypothesis. Also in this case the best fit corresponds to a small value of\nthe mixing angle \u03b813 (\u03b813 = 90 ). However oscillations between muon and electron\nneutrinos are still allowed as a sub-dominant mode, with the following 90% C.L.\nallowed ranges for the relevant oscillation parameters:\n1.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 <\u2206m232 < 6 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2\n\n(61)\n\n2\n\n0.43 < tan \u03b823 < 4.2\n\n(62)\n\n2\n\n(63)\n\ntan \u03b813 < 0.34\n\nIf the CHOOZ result is included in the atmospheric neutrino analysis, because\nthe full allowed region of \u2206m232 lies within the parameter domain accessible to\nCHOOZ, a tighter constraint can be obtained on the mixing angle \u03b813 and the\ncorresponding 90% C.L. limit becomes even more stringent: tan2 \u03b813 < 0.043 (\u03b813 <\n120 ).\nFinally, a combined analysis of solar, atmospheric and reactor data gives, at\n90% C.L., the following allowed ranges for \u2206m232 , tan2 \u03b823 and tan2 \u03b813 , where the\nlimits on tan2 \u03b813 are given for the SMA solution of the solar neutrino deficit as well\nas for the LMA or unconstrained case:r\n1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 <\u2206m232 < 6 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2\n\n(64)\n\n2\n\n0.39 < tan \u03b823 < 3.1\n\n(65)\n\n2\n\n(unconstrained or LMA)\n\n(66)\n\n2\n\n(SMA)\n\n(67)\n\ntan \u03b813 < 0.055\ntan \u03b813 < 0.075\n\nThe allowed regions for \u2206m221 and \u03b812 obtained from this global analysis are\nshown in Fig.29, both for the unconstrained and constrained case. It is interesting\nto notice that, in the unconstrained case, the best-fit solution lies in the LMA\nregion.\nr in\n\nthe unconstrained case no assumption is made about the solution to the solar neutrino deficit.\n\n\f58\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nFig. 29. Allowed regions in the plane {tan2 \u03b812 , \u2206m221 }, as obtained from the global three-neutrino\nanalysis of solar, atmospheric and reactor data of ref.90 , for both the unconstrained (left) and the\nconstrained fit (right). The star denotes the global best fit solution for the unconstrained fit and\nlocal best fit points for the constrained fit.\n\nIn summary, the analysis in ref.90 shows that, although all solutions to the\nsolar neutrino deficit are still allowed, the LMA solution appears to be favoured.\nMoreover both solar and atmospheric neutrino data seem to prefer small values of\nthe mixing angle \u03b813 , the constraint becoming more stringent with the inclusion of\nthe CHOOZ result. Limits have been extracted also on the other relevant oscillation\nparameters.\nIgnoring CP violation, in the limit Ue3 \u223c 0 (that is to say s13 \u223c 0 and c13 \u223c 1)\nthe MNS matrix (13) can be written as:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nc12\ns12\n0\nU \u2243 \uf8ed\u2212s12 c23 c12 c23 s23 \uf8f8 ,\n(68)\ns12 s23 \u2212c12 s23 c23\n\nOne appealing realization of this matrix would be that corresponding to bimaximal mixing (see, for example, ref.129 ), which postulates that both atmospheric\nand solar neutrino anomalies can be interpreted as neutrino oscillations with maximal mixing (that it to say both \u03b823 and \u03b812 equals \u03c0/4). In this case:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 2\n2\n\uf8ec 1\n1\n1 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\u2212\n\u221a \uf8f7\n(69)\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ec\n2\n\uf8ec 2\n2\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 1\n1 \uf8f8\n1\n\u221a\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2\nHowever it has to be noticed that this form of the mixing matrix seems to be\n\n\fAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\n59\n\nincompatible with the LMA solution of the solar neutrino deficit.130\nIf one tries to define a coherent picture which accommodates also the LSND\nresult, a fourth neutrino has to be introduced. Essentially only two mass schemes\ncan used to describe the mass spectrum, the so called 3 + 1 and 2 + 2 schemes. The\n3+1 scheme, which seems to be disfavoured by experimental data,131,132 corresponds\nto having three relatively close neutrino masses, whose spacing is determined by\nthe two \u2206m2 from the solar and atmospheric neutrino analyses, separated by about\n1 eV2 from an isolated level, which is responsible for the LSND anomaly. In the\n2+2 scheme, instead, two doublets of mass eigenstates, spaced by \u2206m2\u2299 and \u2206m2atm\nrespectively, are separated by the LSND gap. Several analyses of the solar and\natmospheric neutrino data in the 2 + 2 four-neutrino framework have been recently\npresented, showing that, although Super-Kamiokande data disfavour both the pure\n\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bds and the pure \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde channels, it is not possible to exclude their occurrence\nwith sizable oscillation amplitude.133,134\n9. Conclusions\nIn this paper we have reviewed the current status of the search for neutrino\noscillations. After an introduction of the formalism of neutrino oscillation phenomenology, we have discussed the various experimental results which, over the\npast three decades, more or less convincingly, have provided hints for the existence\nof flavour mixing in the neutrino sector: the solar neutrino deficit, the atmospheric\nneutrino anomaly and the LSND effect. If any of these indications will be confirmed\nby future experiments, we would be forced to extend our description of sub-nuclear\nphenomena beyond the Standard Model.\nHaving described the different experimental techniques used to explore different\ndomains of the oscillation parameter space, and having discussed the sources of\nsystematic error intrinsic to each method, we hope we have given most of the information necessary to discern the robustness of each method and result. However,\nwhatever the preference of the reader may be, it is undeniable that more experimental data is urgently needed, before a clearer picture of neutrino oscillation\nphenomenology can be drawn.\nThe near and medium term experimental programme, which is supposed to\nanswer many of the as yet unresolved puzzles, has been described in the previous\nsections. However it is possible that the experiments already approved will not be\nable to provide a definitive solution to all our pending questions. In particular, none\nof the experiments scheduled to start running over the next few years will have the\nsensitivity to address CP violation in the neutrino sector and, except if the actual\nvalue of \u03b813 is very close to the present CHOOZ limit, none of them will be able to\nmeasure that mixing angle. Very ambitious projects, such as neutrino factories135\nor super-intense neutrino beams (super-beams),136 if ever approved, might hold the\nkey to the ultimate solution to the fascinating neutrino mystery.\nTo conclude, whatever the outcome of future experiments, there is no doubt this\nis an extremely exciting time for neutrino physics.\n\n\f60\n\nAn Experimentalist's View of . . .\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank J.
