Analyzing simulations of such neutrino emissions using the wavelet\ntechnique adopted in [1], we find that an upper limit m\u03bd \u223c 0.14 eV could be established\nat the 95 % confidence level if the time variations in emissions were to be preserved during\nneutrino propagation to the Earth.\n\nFebruary 2012\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe observation of a neutrino pulse from supernova SN 1987a has provided many of the\nmost sensitive probes of neutrino properties [2, 3], notably including interesting upper limits on neutrino masses. Initial estimates yielded upper limits m\u03bd \u223c O(10) eV [4], but a\nrecent analysis [5] has derived the stronger upper limit m\u03bd < 5.8 eV, thanks to improved\nunderstanding of one-dimensional (spherically-symmetric) neutrino emission models.\nBased on a recently developed new generation of two-dimensional simulations (axiallysymmetric with polar grid) of core-collapse supernovae [6], we have reported recently [1] on\nthe sensitivity to Lorentz-violating effects in neutrino propagation that could be obtained\nif the time variations are observed in the neutrino emissions from a future core-collapse\nsupernova in our galaxy. It has long been appreciated that SN 1987a provides the most\nstringent upper limits on an energy-independent deviation of the neutrino velocity \u03b4v from\nthat of light [7], and also strong upper limits on possible dependences \u03b4v \u223c E, E 2 [8]. These\nlimits have recently attracted increased attention, as they constrain significantly models for\nthe OPERA report [9] of superluminal neutrino propagation [10,11]. It was also shown in [8]\nthat these limits could be improved if another galactic supernova were to be observed.\nIn the present paper we report on a study of the sensitivity to neutrino mass that would\nbe provided if the time variations found in these two-dimensional simulations were indeed\nto be observed. This prospective sensitivity is very competitive with other constraints on\nneutrino masses, and provides additional motivation (if it is needed) for further validation of\nthe results of two-dimensional core-collapse supernova simulations [6,12,13], particularly via\nthe development of robust three-dimensional simulations [14, 15]. Such simulations could be\nexpected to modify the results presented here, with a tendency to reduce the observability\nof any time structures in the neutrino signal. We note also that we make other assumptions\nthat are on the optimistic side, e.g., we use the signal from one radial ray, rather than a\nfull hemisphere, we follow [6] in using a relatively soft equation of state [16], and we neglect\nneutrino oscillations, which are difficult to quantify with generality.\n\n2\n\nTwo-Dimensional Simulation of a Core-Collapse Supernova\n\nAs discussed in [6], the neutrino emission during the post-bounce accretion phase in the\ntwo-dimensional simulation (unlike its one-dimensional counterpart) exhibits rapid timevariability because of anisotropic mass flows in the accretion layer around the newly-formed\nneutron star. These flows lead to large-scale, non-radial mass motions in the layer between\nthe proto-neutron star surface and the accretion shock, creating hot spots that can produce transiently in preferred directions neutrino radiation that is more luminous and with\na harder spectrum. These temporal variations in the luminosities and mean energies are\nexpected to persist during the hundreds of milliseconds length of the accretion phase. Such\nvariations could yield fractional changes of 10% or more in the emissions of electron neutrinos\nand antineutrinos during the most violent phases of core activity in two-dimensional models\n1\n\n\fwith no or only slow rotation [6, 13]. Smaller effects are expected for muon and tau neutrinos, because lower fractions of them are produced in the outer layers of the proto-neutron\nstar where asymmetric accretion causes the largest perturbations. The fluctuating neutrino\nemission has been shown [6] to be detectable in the IceCube detector [17] in the case of a\nneutrino burst from a future Galactic supernova, with typical frequencies between several\ntens of Hz and roughly 200 Hz [6]. Uncertainties in these predictions include the possibility\nof a stiffer nuclear equation of state, the neutrino transport description that is used, and\n(most importantly) the two-dimensional nature of the simulation.\nWe base our analysis here on the the maximal effects to be expected within the mature\ntwo-dimensional models currently available. We therefore consider emission of electron antineutrinos from the (north-)pole as predicted by the 15 M\u2299 simulation with the relatively\nsoft equation of state of Lattimer & Swesty [16], as presented in [6], with no averaging over\na wider range of latitudes. Possible flavor conversions between electron antineutrinos and\nother antineutrino flavours are ignored.\n\n3\n\nWavelet Analysis Technique\n\nWe use a wavelet transform technique (see [18] for a review and [1] for a more detailed\ndescription of the approach used here) to analyze the neutrino time series generated by the\nsimulated supernova explosion.\nWe use the Morlet wavelet, which is non-orthogonal, complex, and contains a number\nof oscillations sufficient to detect narrow features of the power spectrum. We recall that it\nconsists of a plane wave modulated by a Gaussian function in a variable \u03b7:\n\u03c80 (\u03b7) = \u03c0 \u22121/4 ei\u03c90 \u03b7 e\u2212\u03b7\n\n2 /2\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c90 is a dimensionless frequency. The continuous wavelet transform of a discrete\nsequence xn is defined as the convolution of xn with a scaled and translated version of\n\u03c80 (\u03b7): 1\n\u0014 \u2032\n\u0015\n\u2217 (n \u2212 n)\u03b4t\nN \u22121\nWn (s) = \u03a3n\u2032 =0 xn\u2032 \u03c8\n.\n(2)\ns\nIn our analysis, the xn are obtained from a number of independent statistical realizations\nof the neutrino signal calculated in [6], as discussed in more detail in the last paragraph of\nsection 2.3 of [1]. By varying the wavelet scale s and translating along the localized time\nindex n, one can construct a picture showing both the amplitude of any features versus\nthe scale and how this amplitude varies with time. Although it is possible to calculate the\nwavelet transform using (2), it is convenient and faster to perform the calculations in Fourier\nspace. According to the convolution theorem, the wavelet transform is the Fourier transform\nof the product:\nN \u22121\nWn (s) = \u03a3k=0\nx\u0302k \u03c8 \u2217 (s\u03c9k )ei\u03c9k n\u03b4t ,\n(3)\n1\n\nThe subscript 0 on \u03c8 has been dropped, in order to indicate that \u03c8 has also been normalized (see later).\n\n2\n\n\f2\u03c0k\n2\u03c0k\nand \u2212 N\nfor k \u2264 N2 and k > N2 , respectively. After suitable normalizawhere \u03c9k = + N\n\u03b4t\n\u03b4t\ntion [1], the expectation value of |Wn (s)|2 for a white-noise process is \u03c3 2 for all n and s.

In the middle\npanel of Fig. 1 we use: N = 1024, \u03b4t = 1.785*10\u22124 s, s0 = 2\u03b4t, \u03b4j = 0.125 and J = 48. In our\nsubsequent analysis, we determine significance levels for the wavelet spectra with reference\nto a Gaussian white-noise background spectrum.\n\n400\n\nN\u03bd\n\n300\n200\n100\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.000976562\n0.00195312\n0.00390625\n0.0078125\n0.015625\n0.03125\n\nAvg variance (events2)\n\nPeriod (s)\n\nt(sec)\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\nt (sec)\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\nt (sec)\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\n\nFigure 1: Top panel: The time series of the neutrino emission from the two-dimensional\nsimulation of a core-collapse supernova found in [6].

It has structures on time scales below a hundredth of a\nsecond that lie beyond the fluctuations expected from a 'featureless' white-noise spectrum.\nThe middle panel of Fig. 1 shows the normalized wavelet power spectrum, |Wn (s)|2 /\u03c3 2 , for\nthe time series of the neutrino emission shown in the top panel [1]. The colours represent the\nsignificance of the feature compared to a white-noise spectrum, as measured by the number\nof \u03c3 relative to white noise. Structures in the time series are visible on time scales down to\n\u223c 2\u00d710\u22123 s, several of which have significance well above the 95% confidence level (CL) for a\nwhite-noise spectrum (indicated by red contours). Those with time scales between 2 ms and\n3 ms can be seen in the bottom panel of Fig. 1. We focus on these, rather than structures\non longer time scales, aiming at the best possible time resolution 2 .\nWe investigate here how these structures would be smeared out by the effect of a neutrino\nmass on its velocity v\u03bd :\n\u0012 \u00132\nv\u03bd\nE\n=1\u2212\n.\n(5)\nc\nm\u03bd\nThe neutrino data collected from a supernova explosion will consist of a list of individual\nneutrino events with measured energies Ei and arrival times ti , whereas the results of the\nsimulation in [6] are presented as a set of energy fluxes within time periods of durations\n\u2243 3 \u2212 5 ms. Each of these fluxes may be treated as a black-body spectrum with a specified\nmean energy. We assign statistically to each neutrino in the simulation a specific time of\nemission and energy, based on the mean and total energy of the flux in each time period. In\norder to estimate the sensitivity to the neutrino mass, we make 25 statistically independent\nrealizations of the neutrino emission, make a wavelet transform of each implementation, and\nanalyze statistically their sensitivities to m\u03bd .\nOur prospective upper limit on m\u03bd is calculated by requiring that the fine-scale time\nstructures in the wavelet power spectrum do not disappear below the 95% CL of significance\nfor a signal above the white-noise power spectrum. Specifically, we apply to each neutrino\nevent an energy-dependent time shift\n\u2206t =\nwhere\n\n\u03c4m\n,\nE2\n\n(6)\n\nLm2\u03bd\n.\n(7)\nc\nWe then vary \u03c4 m (m\u03bd ) and follow the evolution of the signal in the neutrino time series. If\nthere were a non-trivial energy-dependent mass effect during propagation from the supernova,\nit could be compensated by choosing the \"correct\" value of the time shift \u03c4 m , in which case\nthe original time structure at the source is recovered. On the other hand, dispersion at\nthe source itself could not, in general, be compensated by any choice of \u03c4 l . Quantitatively,\nthe time structure of the supernova signal is recovered by maximizing the fraction of the\n\u03c4m =\n\n2\n\nSee, however, the caveats in [1].\n\n4\n\n\fscale-averaged power spectrum above the 95% CL line. In order to calculate a lower limit on\n\u03c4 m in any specific model, we examine the fine-scale time structures that appear above the\n95% CL in the bottom panel of Fig. 1 and determine the value of the time-shift parameter\n(7) at which the signal above the 95% CL disappears.\n\n350\n300\n\n200\n\nN\n\n\u03bd\n\n250\n\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\nt(sec)\n\n2\n\nAvg. variance (events )\n\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\nt (sec)\n\nFigure 2: Upper panel: The time series of the neutrino emission from the two-dimensional\nsimulation of a core-collapse supernova after applying an energy-dependent time shift \u03c4m =\n0.019 s * MeV2 .

The vertical\naxis of the lower plot shows the strength of the emissions in the structures with time scales\nbetween 2 and 3 ms, applying an energy-dependent time shift \u03c4m = 0.019 s * MeV2 . Looking\nat the structures that occur between 0.22 and 0.34 s after the start, we see that their\nsignificant parts (those above the 95% fluctuation level for white-noise background (as seen\nin Fig. 1) disappear for time delays \u03c4m = 0.019 s * MeV2 and above, corresponding to\nm\u03bd > 0.14 eV if a supernova distance L of 10 kpc is assumed. This sensitivity is one-and-ahalf orders of magnitude more sensitive than that found in [5], namely m\u03bd < 5.8 eV, based\non a one-dimensional simulation of a core-collapse supernova that did not exhibit the small\n5\n\n\ftime-scale structures seen in Fig. 1.\n\n\u03a3 (\u00d7 10 -3)\n\nAmount of signal above 95% level: E-2 case, scales 2 - 3 ms\n\n40\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n-0.02 -0.015 -0.01 -0.005\n\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0.01 0.015 0.02\n\u03c4 (s\u00d7 MeV2)\n\nFigure 3: A Gaussian fit to the amount \u03a3 of the short time-scale signal above the 95% CL,\ncalculated for 21 values of the shift parameters \u03c4m . Each point is obtained as the average\nover 25 realizations of the time-energy assignments of individual neutrinos.\nWe have repeated this exercise with 25 different statistical realizations of the neutrino\nemission, calculating in each case the amount \u03a3 of the total signal above 95% CL for different\nvalues of \u03c4m sampled in 21 bins. The results of these 25 realizations can be fit quite well\nby a Gaussian distribution, as seen in Fig. 3, which displays our results for the structures\nwith time scales between 2 and 3 ms that occur between 0.22 and 0.34 s after the start. The\nposition of the maximum, which defines the value of \u03c4 that maximizes the time structures\nin the signal and is expected to be zero, is indeed consistent with zero to within a precision\nof 0.001 s * MeV2 , while the structures are washed out at\n\u03c4 m = 0.019 s * MeV2 .\n\n(8)\n\nHence, if significant time structures of the type found in the two-dimensional simulation [6]\nwere to be seen in IceCube or a water \u010cerenkov low-energy detector in neutrino data from\na core-collapse supernova at a distance of 10 kpc, one could conclude that\nm\u03bd < 0.14 eV.\n\n(9)\n\nOn the other hand, if no such structures were seen, this could mean either that the structure\nwas washed out by the effect of neutrino propagation with m\u03bd & 0.14 eV (which is still\n6\n\n\fconsistent with the cosmological limit m\u03bd < 0.23 eV [19]), or that the structure found\nin [6, 13] is not valid.\nThe first possibility could be probed by performing a series of analyses of the above type in\nseveral different bands of the power spectrum 3 . In practice, in the presence of an apparently\nstructureless original signal, one would average systematically over all possible bands with a\nrelatively small step of granularity, defined by the precision of the analysis, while changing\n\u03c4m so as to maximize the amount of the signal above the 95% CL for the averaged power in\nevery band included in the scan. As soon as a value of \u03c4m is found with a significant fraction\nof the signal above the 95% CL line at \u03c4m & 0.019 s * MeV2 , one could claim evidence for a\nnon-zero neutrino mass. On the other hand, if such a scanning analysis delivered a negative\nresult, inferring a lower limit on m\u03bd would require strong independent confirmation of the\nstructures found in [6, 13], in particular by full three-dimensional simulations.\nWe note that the possibility of a time advance is also considered in Fig. 3. This would\ncorrespond to a neutrino with m2\u03bd < 0, i.e., a tachyon. As pointed out, e.g., in [10], the time\nadvance reported by OPERA [9] could not be associated with tachyonic neutrinos because,\ne.g., this would require an unacceptable time advance \u223c 4y for neutrinos from supernova\nSN1987a 4 . Conversely, SN 1987a provides the strongest available lower limit on negative m2\u03bd .\nCorrespondingly, observation of the short time structures suggested by [6] would establish\na much stronger limit on the possible tachyonic nature of the neutrino: m2\u03bd > \u22120.02 eV2 ,\nwhich would also be significantly stronger than the bound m2\u03bd > \u22120.11 eV2 recently derived\nby combining neutrino constraints from Big-Bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave\nbackground [20].\n\n5\n\nConclusions and Prospects\n\nWe have shown that the existence of structures with short time scales in the neutrino emission\nfrom a core-collapse supernova, as suggested by two-dimensional simulations [6, 13], would\nopen up new prospects for probing neutrino masses. The sensitivity (9) extends up to oneand-a-half orders of magnitude beyond the sensitivity provided by previous analyses based\non one-dimensional supernova simulations [5]. This sensitivity is comparable to the \u223c 0.2 eV\nobtainable with the KATRIN experiment [21], and to the potential sensitivity to m\u03bd provided\nby large-scale structure surveys in combination with measurements of the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation [19].\nIf such short time structures were not to be seen in emissions from a future core-collapse\nsupernova, many checks would be necessary before one could conceivably claim observation\nof a non-zero neutrino mass. In particular, it would be necessary to validate the structures\n3\n\nWe recall that, in order to obtain the greatest sensitivity, the averaging in Fig. 1 was performed in the\n\u223c 2\u20133 ms band where the shortest time-varying structures appear above the 95% CL. However, there are\nstructures at other scales, e.g., in the \u223c 7\u201315 ms band.\n4\nThere is a more fundamental problem with Lorentz-invariant tachyonic neutrinos, namely that there\nare no non-trivial finite-dimensional unitary representations of the Lorentz group for m2 < 0 that could\ncorrespond to spin-1/2 fermions. However, here we restrict ourselves to phenomenological constraints on\ntachyonic neutrinos.\n\n7\n\n\fpredicted by the two-dimensional core-collapse supernova simulation on which this analysis\nis based, specifically in full three-dimensional simulations [14,15]. It would also be necessary\nto test the influence of some of the other special or simplifying assumptions made here, e.g.,\nthe use of the signal from one radial ray [6], the use of a relatively soft equation of state [16],\nand the neglect of neutrino oscillations. On the other hand, convergent indications from\nsupernova observations, KATRIN [21] and astrophysical observations [22] would substantiate\nand consolidate any determination of neutrino mass in the range 0.1 to 0.2 eV.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe work of J.E. and N.E.M. was supported partly by the London Centre for Terauniverse\nStudies (LCTS), using funding from the European Research Council via the Advanced Investigator Grant 267352.
