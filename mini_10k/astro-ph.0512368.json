Introduction\nInflation stretches the fluctuations outside the Hubble radius which later on enter\ninside the Hubble radius to seed the structure formation [2]. A single field inflationary model generates Gaussian fluctuations which is in an excellent agreement with\nthe current observations [3]. These Gaussian fluctuations are due to the adiabatic\nspectrum of the curvature perturbations [4], for a review see [5], which in a single\nfield case is conserved after the wavelength of a perturbed mode becomes larger than\nthe Hubble radius 1 . For multiple fields there is an iso-curvature component which\n1\n\nPerturbations whose wavelength is larger than the Hubble radius are often abused in the literature as \"super-horizon perturbations\", instead they should be called as \"super-Hubble perturbations. Note that due to inflation the perturbations are always well inside the causal horizon. We\nparticularly thank Robert Brandenberger for stressing this point time and again.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fcan source the curvature perturbations, i.e., as a result the curvature perturbations\nare no longer conserved on large scales.\nAlthough negligible but a finite calculable departure from Gaussianity can be\nobtained within a single field inflationary model, with a self interacting inflaton\npotential. However the measure for non-Gaussianity, defined as fN L (see the precise\ndefinition below), is bounded by the slow roll parameters [6, 7], i.e., fN L \u223c |\u03b7 \u2212 3\u01eb|,\nwhere the slow roll parameters, \u01eb, \u03b7 \u226a 1. This trend remains true even for multi\nfield case, see for example [8\u201310]. Unless the slow roll conditions are violated during\ninflation, it is hard to imagine a reasonably large non-Gaussianity can be generated,\nwhich would really challenge the common lore that slow roll inflation produces mainly\nGaussian fluctuations. For a review on non-gaussianity, see [11].\nThe only exceptional moment is right at the time when inflation ends, when the\nslow roll parameters become large, i.e., \u01eb, \u03b7 \u223c O(1), nevertheless this still leaves\nfN L \u223c O(1) [12]. Large fN L \u226b 1, however, can be obtained during preheating after\ninflation as we illustrated in our previous paper [1] 2 .\nParticularly a scalar preheating [16] is a phase where after inflation the coherent\noscillations of the inflaton, \u03c6, dominates the energy density of the Universe and\nanother scalar field, \u03c3, coupled to the inflaton through, g 2\u03c62 \u03c3 2 , is excited from the\nvacuum fluctuations. In this respect preheating is a non-perturbative phenomena.\nAlthough preheating does not lead to a complete thermalization [17, 18], nevertheless,\nin many models preheating can be just a possibility before the perturbative decay\nof the inflaton, for example see the last reference of [16], if there exists favorable\nconditions such as significantly large coupling. In reality it is hard to predict exactly\nhow the inflaton couples to the Standard Model degrees of freedom, due to lack of a\nmodel where the inflaton is not an absolute gauge singlet [19] 3 , therefore, it becomes\ndifficult to pin down thermalization time scales, etc., which can be tested through\npresent cosmological experiments. Nevertheless, very recently as we pointed out that\npreheating can give rise to a large non-Gaussianity which can lead to constraining\ncertain parameter regions, such as a coupling constant [1, 13, 14], we regard this as a\nwindow of opportunity to test the initial stage of preheating.\nIn order to understand why preheating is the test bed for a large primordial\nnon-Gaussianity. Let us first note that in general we require:\n\u2022 Significant interaction which leads to curved potential that breaks slow roll\nconditions.\n\u2022 Some small amplitude isocurvature fluctuations which could be amplified later\non via non-adiabatic evolution.\n2\n\nSee also other examples considered in Refs. [13, 14] and [15].\nAn exceptional case of assisted inflation [20] with gauge invariant supersymmetric flat directions [19] can possibly address this crisis [21].\n3\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fDuring preheating it is possible to have both the criteria fulfilled. The first\none can be obtained mainly because during preheating the slow roll conditions are\nviolated. The second condition is also satisfied because the \u03c3 field, which carries\nisocurvature fluctuations 4 , undergoes non-adiabatic evolution. The quantum modes\nof \u03c3 field are excited because of the time dependence on the effective mass of \u03c3 field\n(due to coupling between \u03c6 and \u03c3 where \u03c6 is oscillating) changes sign, therefore\nviolates adiabatic evolution of the vacuum.\nStill a reader might wonder why amplifying \u03b4\u03c3k leads to a large non-Gaussianity?\nAfter all non-Gaussianity is related to the second order curvature fluctuations. Two\nspecific questions could be:\n\u2022 Can a sub-Hubble process influence the super-Hubble second order curvature\nperturbations?\n\u2022 Can existing super-Hubble modes amplify themselves to influence the second\norder curvature perturbations?\nNote that the second order perturbations take into account of the interactions in\nleading order of the perturbation theory, namely the quadratic combinations of the\nfirst order perturbations act as sources for the second order. In momentum space\nthe sources become convolutions and thus couple different scales. To answer the first\nquestion, we should also keep in mind that inflation makes the causal horizon exponentially large compared to the Hubble radius. Therefore causality allows various\nmodes to mix, i.e., super-Hubble modes in second order can be influenced by either\nconvoluting the first order sub-Hubble modes or the first order super-Hubble modes.\nIn paper [1] we studied preheating related to m2 \u03c62 -potential for the inflaton where\nthe resonance affects the super-Hubble modes in second order through sub-Hubble\nperturbations, i.e., it relates to the first question.\nIn this paper we provide a generic expression for the second order curvature\nperturbation which are fed by the super-Hubble fluctuations in the first order. As an\nexample we consider preheating in \u03bb\u03c64 -potential for the inflaton where the second\norder super-Hubble modes are affected.\nLet us now highlight the role of isocurvature fluctuations. It is a well known fact\nthat the isocurvature fluctuations source the adiabatic fluctuations and therefore the\ncurvature perturbations. The adiabatic perturbations cannot increase by themselves\non super-Hubble scales without iso-curvature perturbations. This is true in first\norder perturbations, in second order case there are additional sources which feed the\nsecond order metric and curvature perturbations, we shall see them below. Without\n4\n\nThe fluctuations in \u03c3 field will be scale invariant and the amplitude of the fluctuations in \u03c3 will\nbe similar to that of the inflaton, i.e., \u03b4\u03c3 \u223c Hinf /2\u03c0 (during inflation and after the first few inflaton\noscillations). With these comparatively large initial amplitude and scale invariant fluctuations it is\npossible to amplify the fluctuations in \u03b4\u03c3k on super Hubble scales.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fhaving isocurvature fluctuations it is therefore not possible to amplify the first order\nand subsequently the second order curvature perturbations. However note that nonGaussianity is a ratio between the second order curvature perturbation with respect\nto square of the first order curvature perturbations. If both first and second order\ncurvature perturbations grow due to large isocurvature fluctuations then the ratio\nneed not be large always.\nTherefore in order to get large non-Gaussianity we need a setup where only the\nsecond order curvature perturbations grow while the first order curvature perturbations do not grow at all. Can this happen in reality?\nYes indeed, this can happen when the isocurvature fluctuations do not seed the\nfirst order perturbations at all, but it only seeds the second order perturbations. We\nachieved this modest goal in our first paper, [1], where the background motion of a\n\u03c3 field were absent, only the coherent oscillations of \u03c6 field were present. In which\ncase the perturbations in \u03c3 decouple from the first order perturbations, but not in\nthe second order and in higher order perturbation theory. Therefore exponentially\nlarge growth in \u03b4\u03c3k can feed the second order curvature perturbations to give rise to\na very large non-Gaussianity.\nThe aim of the present paper is to lay down the formalism for second order\ncurvature perturbations, where there is a single field dominating the energy density\nof the Universe while other multi-fields can leave their imprints via fluctuations 5 .\nWe also show that the second order curvature perturbation becomes free from the\nnon-local contributions on super-Hubble scales when we neglect the gradient terms,\nwhich is true in a generic background (all the scalar fields can have non-vanishing\nVEVs), see the detailed discussion in A.2.\nAs an application we will consider a massless preheating, where the \u03c3 field does\nnot have a bare mass term and the inflaton potential is quartic, i.e., V (\u03c6, \u03c3) \u223c\n\u03c64 + g 2 \u03c62 \u03c3 2 . This potential has certain nice properties which we will highlight in\nthe course of our discussion, i.e., the instability band for the \u03b4\u03c3k mode depends\non the ratio, g 2 /\u03bb, cosmologically interesting solutions can be obtained for the first\ninstability band, 1 < g 2 /\u03bb < 3. In order to obtain the results analytically, we assume\nthat the background value of \u03c3 is vanishing. A non-vanishing case has to be studied\nseparately with an aid of numerics 6 .\nA large non-Gaussianity also depends on the number of oscillations, if the number\nof oscillations grow the non-Gaussianity grows exponentially at an alarming rate, see\n5\n\nIn our previous papers [1, 13, 14] we mainly studied the first order and second order metric\nperturbations, which need not be conserved on large scales. Here our formalism is more robust\nas we study the perturbations in terms of conserved quantities, \u03b6 (1) , \u03b6 (2) , for the definition see\nbelow. In this paper we verify our earlier claim that preheating can really boost large primordial\nnon-Gaussianity.\n6\nIf \u03c3 field is also oscillating and contributing to the energy density of the Universe then again\nwe would have to address the problem numerically.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fthe Plots. [1,2]. A simple explanation can be given as follows, fluctuations of the \u03c3\nfield grow as \u223c e2\u03bcx , where \u03bc \u223c 0.2 is a physical parameter governing the production\nof \u03c3 particles ( for a detailed discussion, see below) and x is time in dimensionless\nunits which measures the period of oscillations, T \u223c 7, so that the time elapsed is the\nnumber of oscillations, N \u223c 3, times the period, i.e., x = NT . With these numbers\nthe growth factor is amazingly large,\ne2\u03bcx \u223c e8.4 \u223c 4000 .\n\n(1.1)\n\nBarring accidental cancellations between various source terms or dampening the initial amplitude for the isocurvature fluctuations this leads to a large non-Gaussianity.\nHowever we should remind the readers that the phase of preheating cannot last\nforever. Besides the metric and curvature perturbations there is a backreaction\non energy momentum components due to exponentially large particle creation, this\ninevitably stops preheating. Depending on the couplings the backreaction can stop\npreheating in dozens of oscillations. When the backreaction becomes important our\nassumption with a vanishing VEV of \u03c3 field also breaks down.\nUnless the time evolution of \u03c3 field really brings down the non-Gaussianity parameter to the level that is consistent with the current observations, the model\nconsidered in our paper with 1 < g 2 /\u03bb < 3 is deemed to be ruled out. For other instability bands the effective mass for the \u03c3 field becomes heavy, i.e., m\u03c3, ef f \u2265 Hinf ,\nwhich decreases the amplitude of the isocurvature fluctuations and leads to a smaller\nnon-Gaussianity parameter. In this respect non-Gaussianity acts as a discriminatory\nand it should be considered as a useful observable to distinguish various physical\nsituations.\nWe begin with the definitions, then we describe the first and second order curvature perturbations. We then discuss the background evolution where we obtain the\nfinal expression for the second order curvature perturbations for more than one field,\nprovided the background evolution is governed by one field alone, for an example this\ncould be the inflaton. We then turn our attention to a massless preheating and derive\nan expression for the non-Gaussianity parameter. In order to be self consistent, we\nadded an appendix, where useful relationships have been derived explicitly.\n\n2.

This requires that V,\u03c3i = 0 through the\nKlein-Gordon equation. The scalar fields are divided as usual into background and\nperturbations:\n1\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(0) + \u03c6(1) + \u03c6(2) ,\n2\n1 (2)\n(0)\n(1)\n\u03c3k = \u03c3k + \u03c3i + \u03c3i ,\n2\n\n(2.6)\n(2.7)\n\n(0)\n\nwhere \u03c3i is constant and the field fluctuations in the flat gauge, \u03c8 (1) = \u03c8 (2) = 0,\n(1,2)\n(1,2)\n(1,2)\nare Sasaki-Mukhanov variables, \u03c6(1,2) = Q\u03c6 and \u03c3i\n= Qi .\n2.2 Curvature perturbation\n2.2.1 First order\nThe first order curvature perturbation is defined as\n\u03b6 (1) = \u2212\u03c8 (1) \u2212 H\n\n\u03c1(1)\n,\n\u03c1(0)\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere \u03c8 is the perturbation of the trace of the spatial metric and \u03c1 is the total\nenergy density. This combination is gauge invariant. The evolution of the first order\ncurvature perturbation on large scales is given by, see for example [5]:\n\u2032\n\n\u03b6 (1) = \u2212\n\n\u03c1(0)\n\nH\n\u0393(1) ,\n+ p(0)\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n(2.9)\n\n\fwhere \u0393(1) is the iso-curvature perturbation or non-adiabatic pressure,\n\u2032\n\n\u0393(1) = p(1) \u2212\n\np(0) (1)\n\u03c1 .\n\u03c1(0) \u2032\n\n(2.10)\n\nFor adiabatic perturbations, \u0393(1) = 0, and the curvature perturbation is conserved\non large scales. This happens when there is a single fluid with a definite equation\nof state or for one scalar field on super-Hubble scales. However, in the general case\nwhere there are multiple fluids or scalar fields, the iso-curvature perturbation does\nnot necessarily vanish.\n2.2.2 Second order\nIn the second order a similar equation is obeyed on large scales,7 see also [23]\n\u2032\n\n\u03b6 (2) = \u2212\n\nH\n\u0393(2)\n\u03c1(0) + p(0)\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere\n\u03b6\n\n(2)\n\n\u2032\n\u0011\n\u03c1(1) \u03c1(1)\n\u03c1(1) \u0010 (1) \u2032\n\u03c1(2)\n(1)\n+\n2\n= \u2212\u03c8 \u2212 H (0) \u2032 + 2H\n\u03c8\n+\n2H\u03c8\n2\n\u03c1\n\u03c1(0) \u2032\n\u03c1(0) \u2032\n\u0012 (1) \u00132 \u0012\n\u2032\u2032 \u0013\n\u03c1\n\u03c1(0)\n\u2032\n2\n+ (0) \u2032\nH + 2H \u2212 H (0) \u2032\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\n(2)\n\n(2.12)\n\nand\n\u0393\n\n(2)\n\n\u0014 (1) \u0012 (1) \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u0013\np(0) (2)\n\u03c1\np(1)\n\u03c1\n(0) \u2032\n= p \u2212 (0) \u2032 \u03c1 + p\n2 (0) \u2032\n\u2212 (0) \u2032\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u03c1(0) \u2032\np\n#\n\u0013\n\u0012 (1) \u00132 \u0012 (0) \u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03c1(0)\n2\np\n\u03c1\n(1) 2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u0393\n+ 4\u03b6 (1) \u0393(1) .\n+\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c1(0)\np(0)\n\u03c1(0)\n\u03c1(0) + p(0)\n(2)\n\n(2.13)\n\nAgain if isocurvature contribution vanishes then \u03b6 (2) is conserved on super-Hubble\nscales. This has already been shown in [23, 25] and it has also been generalized to\nall orders [24, 26]. Going to higher orders gives new possibilities, namely \u03b6 (1) could\nbe conserved but \u03b6 (2) might not, since it may happen that \u0393(1) = 0 but \u0393(2) 6= 0.\nThis is especially interesting situation for the cosmological non-Gaussianity which is\ndefined as\n3\n2\n\u03b6 (2) = \u2212 fN L \u03b6 (1)\n(2.14)\n5\nIf \u0393(1) = 0 then \u03b6 (1) is conserved but \u0393(2) 6= 0 then \u03b6 (2) changes and therefore also\nthe non-Gaussianity parameter, fN L , changes.\n7\n\nThis has been generalized to all orders and scales by Langlois and Vernizzi [24].\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\f2.3 Evolution of the Perturbations\nFrom now on we adopt the flat gauge, \u03c81 = \u03c82 = 0, and neglect terms that contain\ntwo or more spatial derivatives. We also take only one of the fields to be evolving at\nthe background and call this \u03c6 and the rest of the fields do not evolve at the background level, \u03c3i\u2032 = 0. For details and general expressions see [22]. The components\nof the Einstein tensor and energy momentum tensor have been given in A.1.\nThe evolution equations for the background are given by the Friedmann equation,\n3MP2 H2 =\n\n1 (0) \u2032 2\n+ a2 V0 ,\n\u03c6\n2\n\n(2.15)\n\nand the Klein-Gordon equation,\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c6(0) + 2H\u03c6(0) + a2 V,\u03c6 = 0 .\n\n(2.16)\n\nIn addition one can write the equation for the evolution of the Hubble parameter,\nwhich is not independent of the other two equations:\nH\u2032 = H2 \u2212\n\n1\n\u20322\n\u03c6(0) .\n2\n2MP\n\n(2.17)\n\nThe Klein-Gordon equations at 1st order read\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(1)\nQ(1)\n+ 2HQ(1)\n\u2212 \u03c6(0) \u03c6(1) + a2 V,\u03c6\u03c6 Q(1)\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c6 \u2212 \u25b3Q\u03c6 = 0 ,\nX\n(1)\n(1) \u2032\n(1) \u2032\u2032\nV,\u03c3k \u03c3n Q(1)\nQk + 2HQk + a2\nn \u2212 \u25b3Qk = 0 .\n\n(2.18)\n(2.19)\n\nn\n\nWe will not need the 2nd order Klein-Gordon equations at all. This is due to the\nfact that on the background level only \u03c6(0) has a non-trivial evolution.\nThe gauge-invariant curvature perturbation at 1st order in terms of the Mukhanov\nvariables is given by:\nH\n(2.20)\n\u03b6 (1) = \u2212 (0) \u2032 Q(1)\n\u03c6 .\n\u03c6\n\u2032\n\nThis is a conserved quantity on large scales (with the approximations made \u03b6 (1) = 0).\nUsing 0 \u2212 i Einstein equation one obtains:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3HV0 a2 V,\u03c6\n(1) \u2032\n+ (0) \u2032 Q(1)\n(2.21)\nQ\u03c6 = \u2212\n\u03c6 .\n(0)\n\u03c1\n\u03c6\nThe corresponding conserved variable at 2nd order is given by [22]:\n\u00132 \u0014\n\u0012\n\u03c1(0)\na2 \u03c1(0)\n3V0\nH (1)\n(2)\n(2) \u2032\n(2)\n\u03b6 =\n+\nV,\u03c6 Q\u03c6 +\n\u2032 Q\u03c6\n\u2032 Q\u03c6\n\u20322\n(0)\n(0)\n(0)\n3V0 \u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c1(0)\n3V0 \u03c6\n#\n\u2032\n\u20322\na4 \u03c1(0) V,\u03c62\na2 \u03c1(0) V,\u03c6\u03c6 2V,\u03c6 \u03c6(0)\n6 \u03c6(0)\n+\n+\n+ 2 (0) \u2212 4\n2 +\n3V0 H2\nHV0\na\u03c1\n3V0 H2 \u03c6(0) \u2032\nX (1) \u2032 2\na2 \u03c1(0) X\n\u03c1(0)\n(1)\n+\nQ\nV,\u03c3k \u03c3n Qk Q(1)\n+\nn .\nk\n\u20322\n\u20322\n(0)\n(0)\n3V0 \u03c6\n3V\n\u03c6\n0\nk\nk,n\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n(2.22)\n\n\fSolving \u03c6(1) and \u03c6(2) from 0 \u2212 0 Einstein equations and then taking the divergence\nof the 2nd order 0 \u2212 i part of the Einstein equation and then taking the inverse\nLaplacian, we obtain\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3HV0 a2 V,\u03c6\n(2) \u2032\n+ (0) \u2032 Q(2)\n(2.23)\nQ\u03c6 +\n\u03c6 = J\u03c6 ,\n\u03c1(0)\n\u03c6\nwhere\n1\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0002 2\n3HV0 (1) \u2032 (1)\n(1) 2\nQ\na V,\u03c6\u03c6\nQ\n+\nQ\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03c1(0)\n#\n\u20322\n\u2032\nX (1) \u2032 2\n9H2 V0 \u03c6(0)\n6a2 HV,\u03c6 \u03c6(0)\n+\n+\nQk\n+\n2\n\u03c1(0)\na2 \u03c1(0)\nk\n)\n\u0010\n\u0011,j\nX\nX\n\u2032\n6HV\n0\n(1)\n(1)\n(1) (1)\nQk Qk,j\n.\n+a2\nV,kl Qk Ql + (0) \u25b3\u22121\n\u03c1\nk\nk\n\nJ\u03c6 = \u2212\n\n(0) \u2032\n\nQ(1)\n\u03c6\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n+\n\n(2.24)\n\nThen the solution to Eq.

During inflation the background field\nis slow-rolling and this problem is circumvented but after inflation when the inflaton\n(1)\noscillates before decaying it is a problem. Since Qi and their derivatives are well\ndefined variables with no singularities, the Klein-Gordon equations guarantee this,\n\u20322\nthe only singularity in the source integral comes from 1/\u03c6(0) which gets multiplied\n\u2032\nby \u03c6(0) after integration. We can extract that singular behavior by expanding all\n\u2032\nthe quantities around the time \u03b7i , where \u03c6(0) (\u03b7i ) = 0. Then\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u03c6(0) = \u03c6(0) (\u03b7i ) (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7i ) + O(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7i )2 + ... ,\n\n(2.26)\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nwhere \u03c6(0) (\u03b7i ) 6= 0 during oscillations and the rest of the terms inside the integral\nare also non-vanishing, but regular at \u03b7 = \u03b7i , so we can replace them in the most\nsingular term by constants.

Next one\nhas to define the constant C in Eq. (2.25) in terms of some initial condition at\n\u2032\n\u03b7 = \u03b70 . Here we have to choose a time such that \u03c6(0) (\u03b70 ) 6= 0, since otherwise the\nhomogeneous term vanishes and we are not able to define the constant.

This is not really dangerous if\nwe are able to do the integral in closed form but if one needs to evaluate it numerically\nit is a real complication, see A.3 for a toy example that clarifies the complications\nrelated to the oscillations.\nFinally, what we are really interested in is the curvature perturbation, \u03b6 (2) , and\n(2)\nnot the Sasaki-Mukhanov variable Q\u03c6 . However, the curvature perturbation is\nnot well defined during oscillations since it is obtained from the Sasaki-Mukhanov\n\u2032\nvariable by dividing with \u03c6(0) , see Eq. (2.22). This problem occurs even in first\n\u20322\norder, see Eq. (2.20). The solution is to consider instead \u03c6(0) \u03b6 or (1 + w)\u03b6, where\n\u20322\n1 + w = \u03c6(0) /(a2 \u03c1(0) ), which has been used in first order calculations successfully\nand it also works in second order.

Massless preheating\nAs an application to our formalism, let us consider a simple potential,\n1\n1\nV (\u03c6, \u03c3) = \u03bb\u03c64 + g 2\u03c62 \u03c3 2 ,\n4\n2\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the inflaton and \u03c3 field is coupled to the inflaton with a coupling strength g.\nAfter inflation the inflaton, \u03c6, begins coherent oscillations with an initial amplitude\n\u223c O(1)MP . During this process it amplifies \u03c3k non-thermally. This happens because\n\u03c3 field sees the time varying mass due to its coupling to the inflaton. In this paper\nwe are interested in studying the fluctuations of the low momentum modes of the\n\u03c3 field.

(3.4) can be rewritten as:\n1\n1\n1\n3MP2 a\u20322 = \u03c7\u20322 + \u03bb\u03c74 = \u03bb\u03c7\u03044 ,\n2\n4\n4\n9\n\n(3.7)\n\nAt initial stages \u03c3 = 0 is a very good approximation, as the VEV of \u03c6 decreases it eventually\nsets a motion for \u03c3 field due to the backreaction of produced \u03c3 quanta. In Ref. [30] the authors\nanalyze non-linear perturbations when the backreaction is important, however they do not estimate\nthe non-Gaussianity parameter in their case. In our case we estimate non-Gaussianity from the\nexponential growth of the linear perturbations of \u03c3 field.\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fwhere in the last equality the fact that energy of \u03c7 is conserved when expansion is\nneglected as guaranteed by Eq. (3.5). The solution of Eq. (3.7) gives a \u223c \u03b7 from\nwhich follows that a\u2032\u2032 = 0, so that the approximation is consistent. This also results\ninto H = 1/\u03b7.\nNow we study the gauge invariant fluctuations of \u03c3, which is described by the\n(1)\nMukhnaov variable Q\u03c3 . However in this particular case the Mukhanov variable\nis equivalent to the field fluctuations, \u03b4\u03c3k , because the background value of \u03c3 is\nvanishing. Note that although \u03c3 field carries isocurvature fluctuations, it does not\nsource the first order curvature perturbations due to its vanishing VEV. Therefore\nin our case the fluctuations in \u03c3 cannot be constrained by the current constraints\nfrom the isocurvature perturbation. However these fluctuations do source the second\norder curvature perturbation and therefore are subject to the constraints from nonGaussianity.\nThe fluctuations of \u03c3 can be solved from the perturbed Klein-Gordon equation:\n\u2032\u2032\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\n(1)\nQ(1)\n+ 2HQ(1)\n+ a2 g 2 \u03c6(0) Q(1)\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u03c3 \u2212 \u25b3Q\u03c3 = 0\n(1)\n\n(3.8)\n\n(1)\n\nIt\n\u221a is again useful to make the re-scaling Q\u03c3 = \u03c7\u03c3 /a and change of variable x =\n\u03bb\u03c7\u0304\u03b7. Fourier transforming Eq. (3.8), we obtain:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u221a\ng2 2\n(1)\n(1)\n2\n\u03c7\u0308\u03c3k + \u03ba + cn (x \u2212 x0 , 1/ 2) \u03c7\u03c3k = 0 ,\n(3.9)\n\u03bb\n\nwhere  \u0307 = d/dx and \u03ba2 = k 2 /\u03bb\u03c7\u03042 . Since for observable scales the dimensionless\nmomentum is small, for example for length scale of \u223c 1Mpc it is \u03ba \u223c 10\u221250 , it is\nimportant that the instability band contains also the k = 0 mode, which is actually true for Eq. (3.9), see [27]. This also justifies taking \u03ba = 0 while estimating\nanalytically the non-Gaussianity parameter, for a detailed discussion also see A.4 10 .\nCosmologically the most interesting solutions are the ones with 1 \u2264 g 2/\u03bb \u2264 3,\nsince the condition for \u03c3 to be a light field during inflation is that is mass is less\nthan the Hubble parameter, more specifically g\u03c6(0) < (3/2)H. Using the Friedmann\nequation this can be written as g 2 /\u03bb < 3/16(\u03c6(0) /MP )2 . During the slow-roll phase\n\u221a\n\u01eb = MP2 /2 (V,\u03c6 /V0 )2 = (MP /(2 2\u03c6(0) ))2 < 1, so that during slow-roll the condition\nis obeyed for 1 < g 2 /\u03bb < 3. This also guarantees that the primordial fluctuations\n(generated during inflation) of \u03c3 field are scale invariant.\nThe second order curvature perturbation can be calculated if in Eq. (2.29) we\n\u20322\napproximate the \u03c6(0) with its time average (1 + w)a2 \u03c1(0) , where w = 1/3 for\nradiation dominated universe.

(3.11) has a mild scale dependence for cosmologically interesting scales.\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fWe simplify the analysis further by disregarding the oscillatory behavior inside the\nintegral, since the first two terms are positive definite quantities there is no problem\nwith this and the last term in the integral has an extra Hubble parameter in it so that\nit decays away faster than the first two ones and is therefore less significant. Once the\namplitude of oscillation is known (although now the amplitude grows exponentially)\nthe oscillations can be averaged by adding a factor of \u223c 1/2 which corresponds to a\ntime average of a square of an oscillating function. We also estimate the real solution\nEqs. (A.33-A.38), see A.4, by an exponentially growing function\n1 (1)\n\u03bc(s) (x\u2212x0 )\n\u03c7(1)\n,\n\u03c3 \u2248 \u03c7\u03c3 (\u03b70 )e\n2\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere the 1/2 is due to averaging over the oscillations and \u03bc(s) is given by Eq. (A.36),\nwhere s = g 2 /\u03bb. The growth index \u03bc(s) gets values between 0 and \u03bcmax \u2248 0.2378.\nSince the expansion has been neglected after re-scaling of the field, we take only the\nleading order contributions in terms of the expansion in Eq. (3.10). After simplifying\nthe resulting expression we get\n\u03b6\n\n(2)\n\n=\u03b6\n\n(2)\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0010s\n\u0011Z x 1\n1 2 (1) 2 1 2\u03bc(s)(x\u2212x0 )\n1\n2\n2\u03bc(s)(x\u2212x0 )\n(\u03b70 ) + r \u03b6\ne\n\u2212 2+\n\u2212 \u03bc(s)\ndx e\n4\nx2\nx0\n2\nx\nx0\n(3.12)\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere r = Q\u03c3 (\u03b70 )/Q\u03c6 (\u03b70 ) is the relative magnitude of the \u03c3 and \u03c6 perturbations\nat the end of inflation. If both fields are light one expects r \u2248 1. In reality \u03c3 becomes\nmassive during or after the end of slow-roll period, so that there is a slight damping.\nSecond the perturbations can have different slow-roll parameters so that r can be\nmildly scale dependent.\nWe illustrate the fN L parameter defined in Eq. (2.14) numerically for x = 25\nwhich corresponds to roughly 3 inflaton oscillations. In Plots [1,2], we have drawn\nlog[fN L ] with respect to x. Note that the fN L rises exponentially owing to Eq. (3.12).\n(1)\nThis is because the mode, \u03c7\u03c3 , grows exponentially, i.e., see the discussion above\nEq. (1). The same mode sources the second order curvature perturbation, Eq. (3.12),\nbut not the first order, see Eq. (2.20), therefore the fN L parameter is alarmingly large.\nThis result exceeds the current bound on non-Gaussianity, \u221258 \u2264 fN L \u2264 134 set\nby WMAP [3]. Our results show that massless preheating on the parameter range,\n1 < g 2 /\u03bb < 3, is already ruled out. We do not expect that our result will be modified\ndramatically even if the backreaction due to produced \u03c3 quanta is taken into account.\nNote that the maximal growth index is obtained at g 2/\u03bb = 15/8 = 1.875 and not\ng 2 /\u03bb = 2 as has usually been assumed in the literature, see for instance the recent\npaper [30]. However the difference between the two cases is negligible as is shown is\nPlot 2.\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fLog10 @-fNL D\n2\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nx\n\n-2\n-4\n-6\n\nFigure 1: The evolution of the non-Gaussianity parameter, fN L , with different values of\ng2 /\u03bb = 1.2, 1.5, 1.875 with red, green and blue lines. g 2 /\u03bb = 1.875 is the case with largest\ncharacteristic exponent. The end point corresponds to 3 oscillations of the inflaton and at\nthat point the largest \u2212fN L = 1382.\n\nLog10 @-fNL D\n2\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nx\n\n-2\n-4\n-6\n\nFigure 2: The same as previous figure with g 2 /\u03bb = 1.875, 2, 2.5 with blue, green and red\nlines. The cases with g2 /\u03bb = 1.875 (blue) and 2 (green) produce almost identical results,\nwhich is not surprising since \u03bc1.875 \u2248 0.238 and \u03bc2 \u2248 0.236.\n\n4. Conclusion\nFollowing our previous claim [1], we pointed out in this paper that preheating in\ngeneral can produce very large primordial non-Gaussianity. We substantiate our\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fpoint by providing a formalism which can take into account of the fluctuations for\nmore than one field, therefore accounting for the isocurvature fluctuations which can\nsource the first and second order curvature perturbations. The final expression for\nthe second order curvature perturbation is given by Eq. (2.31).\nWe studied a particular case of massless preheating as an example, where the\nsecond order curvature perturbations are fed by the the isocurvature fluctuations but\nnot the first order. This gives rise to a large non-Gaussianity which already exceeds\nthe currently observed limit. The non-Gaussianity parameter grows exponentially\nand the final number depends on the number of oscillations before the backreaction\nkicks in to halt preheating completely, see the Plots [1,2]. Based on our result we\nrule out completely massless preheating on the parameter range, 1 < g 2 /\u03bb < 3.\nOur results are encouraging and obviously demands thorough study of nonGaussianity generated during preheating. One of the goal will be to setup a numerical\ncode where more than one field can participate in the expansion of the Universe. This\nwould definitely improve the non-Gaussianity bound set in the current paper.\n\n5.

For one field Eq. (2.21) shows that f = 0.\nThis is not surprising since for one dimensional system the first derivative is always\nproportional to the function itself where the proportionality depends only on time\nas long as we work with the leading order of gradient expansion. For multiple fields\nit is enough if the matrix of proportionality is symmetric and depends only on time.\nSpecial case of this is the one where multiple fields decouple into a system of one field\nmodels. During slow-roll inflation the potential derivatives are of order the slow-roll\nparameters 11 . Then the Klein-Gordon equation at zeroth order of slow-roll is:\n(1) \u2032\u2032\n\nQik\n\n(1) \u2032\n\n(1)\n\n+ 2HQik + k 2 Qik = 0 ,\n\n(A.27)\n\nwith the well-known solution (during inflation a = \u22121/(H\u03b7) with H = const.)\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\n1\n(1)\n\u2212ik\u03b7\n1+\nQik = \u221a e\n.\n(A.28)\nk\u03b7\na 2k\nThe derivative of this solution is proportional to the solution itself with the proportionality given by a time-dependent function at the leading order in large scales,\n(1)\n(1) \u2032\nQik = fi (\u03b7)Qik (actually in this case the time derivative vanishes in leading order\nbut in general it is proportional to slow-roll parameters, however the main point is\nthat the proportionality factor in leading order does not depend on k). Then the\nnon-local term can be solved using the Fourier-transform\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011,j X 1\nX\n(1)\n(1) \u2032\n\u22121\n(1) \u2032 (1)\n\u22122\n\u25b3\nQm Qm,j\n=\nd3 k\u2032 Qmk\u2032 k * (k \u2212 k\u2032 )Qm(k\u2212k\u2032 ) =\nk\n3\n(2\u03c0)\nm\nm\nZ\nX\n1\n(1)\n(1)\n\u22122\nd3 k\u2032 Qmk\u2032 k * (k \u2212 k\u2032 )Qm(k\u2212k\u2032 ) =\nk\nfm (\u03b7)\n3\n(2\u03c0)\nm\n\u0010\n\u0011,j\nX\n1 X (1) \u2032 (1)\n(1)\nQ\nfm (\u03b7)\u25b3\u22121 Q(1)\nQm Qm .(A.29)\n=\nm\nm,j\n2\nm\nm\n11\n\nSame would be true for the extra mass term in the general case.\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fso that the unknown function in Eq. (A.26) actually vanishes f (x) = 0. This\nresult is also valid after inflation since one only needs to specify correspondence of\nnon-local term to a local term at one time. In a sense this is just a result of the\nfact that after horizon crossing the modes evolve in the same way. Another way\nof getting the same result would be to use slow-roll to neglect the second order\ntime derivatives in the Klein-Gordon equation. Then the first order time derivative\nof the Mukhanov variables would be proportional to a time dependent (but space\nindependent) symmetric matrix times the Mukhanov variables. Then one can replace\nthe time derivative in the non-local term and solve it completely to obtain the same\nresult. One should note that both derivations are only valid in large scales since the\nspatial gradient terms were neglected in the derivations. Therefore for small scales\nthe scale dependence should be more important so it is not surprising that there it\nmay not be possible to remove the spatial derivatives.\nA.3 Time averaging and passing through zeros\nLet us study a similar situation with an example concerning elementary functions\nwhere the integrals can be done explicitly. We take\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ x\n1\nf (x) = C cos(x) + sin(x) = cos(x) C +\n(A.30)\ndx 2\ncos (x)\nwhich is a solution of a differential equation\n1\ndf\n+ tan(x)f =\ndx\ncos(x)\n\n(A.31)\n\nThe solution Eq. (A.30) is similar to Eq. (2.25). It also has a similar property with\nrespect to initial values namely cos(x0 ) 6= 0, where x0 is the initial value, has to be\nobeyed. Then\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ x\nf (x0 ) \u2212 sin(x0 )\n1\nf (x0 )\nf (x) =\ncos(x) + sin(x) = cos(x)\n+\ndx\ncos(x0 )\ncos(x0 )\ncos2 (x)\nx0\n(A.32)\nThe first line shows that there are no problems for the solution at any x but the\nsecond form has the same problem as was seen in Eq. (2.28), namely there can\nbe divergences within the range of integration. Although, as long as we are able\nto determine the integral function the divergences are of no consequence, but for\nnumerical evaluation they are a complication and have to be regulated. Typically\nthe regulation is done by taking a time average of the oscillating function inside\nthe integral. However, one should be careful under what situations one should do\nthis. For example taking a time average in Eq. (A.32), which would mean replacing\ncos2 x \u2192 1/2, would result into a linear growth of f (x), whereas the true solution is\njust oscillating. If the source term on the other hand grows exponentially (multiply\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fsin x with ex ) there would be ex inside the integral, too. Now the time average would\nresult correctly into exponential growth of f (x) and the behavior of the amplitude\ncan be traced even if the phase of oscillation would remain unknown. A good check\non whether one gets wrong kind of results by time averaging is to use the solution\nat the points when the oscillating function does vanish, since these can be explicitly\nsolved from the original equation.\nMultiply Eq. (A.31) with cos x and then take cos x = 0. As a result f (x) = \u00b11\nat these points which is reproduced by the solution, Eqs. (A.30,A.32), and is actually\nindependent of the initial conditions. The same can be applied to Eq. (2.23) after\n\u2032\nmultiplying by \u03c6(0) , which would correspond to the original Einstein equation and\n\u2032\n(2)\nthen taking \u03c6(0) = 0. This procedure would exactly give the behavior of Q\u03c6 at\nthese points. The behavior during time of these special points serves as a check for\nthe goodness of taking the time averaging.\nA.4 Super Hubble modes\nThe region of study we are interested in is the CMB scales. These scales correspond\nto \u03ba2 < 10\u221250 [29]. Therefore for any practical purposes we can take \u03ba2 = 0 as an\napproximation.
