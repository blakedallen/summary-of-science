By introducing irreversibility\ninto quantum mechanics one thus has to face all the old\ndifficulties.\nOne quite successful way to introduce relaxation behavior into quantum mechanical models is to consider\nopen systems modeled by a quantum master equation\n[3, 4] or the Lindblad formalism [5, 6, 7]. In these approaches the influence of the environmental system enters\nthe Liouville-von-Neumann equation for the considered\nsystem via incoherent damping terms. To deduce such\na closed evolution equation several approximations are\nnecessary, e.g., the Born-Markov assumption.\nIn the context of quantum thermodynamics has recently been found irreversible behavior in classes of very\nsmall bipartite quantum systems described by a pure\nSchr\u00f6dinger evolution only [8, 9]. This approach does\nnot need those specific assumptions about the environment. Instead, system and environment are treated as a\nwhole. Even in a small bipartite systems, consisting of a\ntwo level system (\"gas system\") coupled to an environment (\"container\") of no more than some hundred levels\nthermodynamical behavior is generic \u2013 relaxation occurs\nto a theoretically predicted equilibrium state (see [10]).\nIn the above mentioned scenarios the gas system has\nbeen very small (from two to five levels) and coupled to\nan environment without any structure or selectivity. In a\nmore complex situation the system under consideration\n\n(gas system) could be constructed from several identical\nsubsystems, e.g. the system could be a spin chain. For\nsuch bipartite systems with increased internal complexity\nthe effect of the coupling topology is not yet completely\nunderstood: If we couple a chain of identical subsystems\nat one edge only to a quantum environment as before, the\nquestion arises whether the whole system will still relax\ninto a thermal equilibrium state. Furthermore, we are interested in whether and when the individual subsystems\nare also in a thermal equilibrium state.\nAccording to recent investigations on local temperature of modular systems [11, 12], we expect the same\nglobal as well as local temperature in the system for\nweakly coupled chains. In cases of a stronger coupling\nthis may no longer be the case (as shown by an open\nsystem approach [13]).\nThose chain systems coupled to a quantum environment will be treated as a closed system subject to\nSchr\u00f6dinger dynamics and will be compared to the modeling via a quantum master equation. In particular,\nwe will analyze chains with different coupling types and\nstrengths with respect to their local as well as global\nthermal or non-thermal properties.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL BACKGROUND\nA.\n\nThe Considered System\n\nWe consider chains of three identical quantum systems\ndescribed by the Hamiltonian\n\u0124s =\n\n3\nX\n\n\u03bc=1\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: henrich@theo1.physik.uni-stuttgart.de\n\n\u0124loc (\u03bc) +\n\n2\n\u03bbX\u02c6\nIs (\u03bc, \u03bc + 1) .\nI \u03bc=1\n\n(1)\n\nHere the first sum contains the local Hamilton operators\n\u0124loc (\u03bc) of site. In our case the local Hamiltonian of site\n\n\f2\n\u03bc reads\n1\n\u0124loc (\u03bc) = 1\u0302 + \u03c3\u0302z (\u03bc),\n2\n\nwith\n\n\u03bc = 1, 2, 3\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u0302z denotes the Pauli spin operator. Here and in\nthe following all energies are taken in units of the Zeeman\nsplitting. The second sum refers to the next neighbor\ncouplings between the subsystems normalized by\nq\n1\n(3)\nI=\nTr{I\u02c6s2 } ,\nn\nwhere n is the Hilbert space dimension of the chain.\nThus, it is possible to control the internal coupling\nstrength by the single parameter \u03bb (see (1)) only, irrespective of the type of coupling. In the following we\ncompare two different interactions \u2013 a random coupling\nI\u02c6sr (\u03bc, \u03bc + 1) =\n\n3 X\n3\nX\ni=1 j=1\n\npij \u03c3\u0302i (\u03bc) \u2297 \u03c3\u0302j (\u03bc + 1),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the pij are normally distributed random numbers\n\nSfrag replacements\nin the interval [\u22121, 1], and a Heisenberg interaction,\n\nI\u02c6sH (\u03bc, \u03bc + 1) =\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\nB.\n\nt[\n\n~ ]\n\u2206E s\n\n\u03c3\u0302i (\u03bc) \u2297 \u03c3\u0302i (\u03bc + 1) .\n\nThe Environment\n\ns\nE 3\n1\n\ns\nE12\n\ns\nE11\n\ns\nE 3\n0\n\ns\nE02\n\ns\nE 1\n0\n\nspin 1\n\n(5)\n\nspin 2\n\nspin 3\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\nHilbert space average approach\n\nLet us start with the complete model under\nSchr\u00f6dinger dynamics. At first sight it may not seem\nclear how a totally time reversible equation like the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation could produce something like irreversible behavior. To clarify this point we introduce\nsome aspects of quantum thermodynamics. A complete\nderivation of all aspects of this theory is beyond the scope\nof this article. Therefore we only sum up some central\naspects of this approach and refer the interested reader\nto [9, 14].\nAccording to quantum thermodynamics (see [9]), the\nsystem proper relaxes to a Gibbsian state whenever the\ndensity of states of the environment is an exponential\nfunction of energy; the latter is typical for many body\nsystems. We model such a quantum environment here by\na system (Fig. 1, the width of the energy levels should\nindicate the degeneracy) of the eight energy levels Eie\nwith degeneracies given by\ne\n\ne)\nN7 (E7\ne)\nN6 (E6\ne)\nN5 (E5\ne)\nN4 (E4\ne)\nN3 (E3\ne)\nN2 (E2\ne)\nN1 (E1\ne)\nN0 (E0\n\n(7)\n\nThis may seem rather artificial, but the idea is as follows:\nthe environment may possess a continuous spectrum, but\ndue to the weak coupling between s and e the system\nonly couples to the resonant levels. Thus we can neglect\nall the other levels. This environment is then expected\nto induce on the spin-chain a canonical state with the\nreciprocal temperature \u03b2,\n\nenvironment\n\nThe model system described in the last section, is now\ncoupled to an adequate environment:\n\u03ba \u02c6\nIse .\nIse\n\nC.\n\nN e (Eie ) = N0e 2Ei .\n\nFIG. 1: Coupling topology of the spin chain to the quantum\nenvironment.\n\n\u0124tot = \u0124s + \u0124e +\n\na way that it couples only to one boundary of the system\n(see Fig. 1), say to the third spin of the chain. Furthermore, the interaction should allow for energy exchange\nbetween system and environment.\nIn the following we will consider both, a complete solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for system and environment according to \u0124tot as well as a quantum master\nequation, simulating a corresponding bath coupling.\n\n(6)\n\n1\n\u2202\n=\u03b2=\nln N e (E)\nkB T\n\u2202E\n\n(8)\n\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann-constant. With the special\ndegeneracy structure (7) this leads to \u03b2 = ln 2.\nFor a numerical test and to avoid any bias we pick for\nI\u02c6se a hermitian random matrix from an ensemble with\nthe distribution [15]\nTr{I\u02c6se }\n1\nP (I\u02c6se ) = \u221a e\u2212 4 .\n4\u03c0\n2\n\nThe first term is the Hamiltonian of the chain, \u0124e refers\nto the Hamiltonian of the environment and I\u02c6se is the\ninteraction between system\nq and environment. After nor1\n2 } (compare (3)) the ex\u02c6\nTr{I\u02c6se\nmalizing Ise via Ise =\nn\n\nternal coupling strength is controlled by the parameter\n\u03ba only. This system environment coupling is taken to be\nsmall in all cases as a precondition to allow for thermodynamic behavior. The interaction will be chosen in such\n\n(9)\n\nTheoretical Predictions: In contrast to the master\nequation approach, the dynamics of the closed system\n(spin chain and environment) is purely Schr\u00f6dinger-type.\nThe von Neumann entropy of the completely closed system thus remains constant. But by splitting up the whole\nsystem into two parts, a small system taken to be the\n\n\f3\nspin-chain and a large one, the environment, the von\nNeumann entropy of the parts can change in time. As a\nmatter of fact, the small system shows a thermodynamical behavior if two restrictions are met:\na) The coupling between the small system and the\nenvironment should be small, i.e. the energy contained in the interaction has to be much smaller\nthan the local energies,\nD E D E\nD E\n(10)\nI\u02c6se \u226a \u0124s , \u0124e\nwhich guarantees that the spectrum of the environment is not disturbed too much.\nb) The Hilbert space of the environment should be\nvery large compared to the Hilbert space of the\nsmall system.\nConversely, all systems meeting these conditions may be\ncalled thermodynamical.\nThe concrete form of the interaction defines an accessible region within the whole Hilbert space, selected by the\ninitial state. Using a model with full energy exchange between system and environment (canonical situation) only\none supplementary condition remains active, the overall\nenergy conservation defining the accessible region. By\na topological investigation of the Hilbert space (see [9]),\nthe details of which are beyond the scope of this article,\nit is possible to show that the state of the complete system will enter a very large region (the dominant region)\nwithin the accessible region, for which the system under\nconsideration is in a state with approximately maximum\nvon Neumann entropy. The respective energy distribution of the small system in this dominant region, i.e. the\nprobability to find the small system in an energy eigenstate Eis (no degeneracy) for an initial state with a sharp\nenergy is then given by\nW d (Eis ) =\n\nNi (Eie )\n,\nNtot\n\n(11)\n\n(for a complete derivation of (11) see [9, 14]).

They have been widely applied to describe\nsystem bath models, in particular in quantum optics [3].\nTheir derivation is standard and can be found in several\ntextbooks. However, since our system, the spin chain, has\nan internal structure and since only one of the boundary\nspins directly couples to the bath, special care must be\ntaken:\n\nThe entire dynamics of the system coupled to the bath\nis given by the Liouville-von-Neumann equation, from\nwhich the Nakajima-Zwanzig equation can be derived [3].\nAssuming that the bath is in a thermal state,\n\u03c1e =\n\ne\u2212\u03b2He\nZe\n\n(12)\n\nan expansion of the latter up to second order in the system bath coupling reads:\nh\nii\nh\ni Z t\nh\nd\u03c1s\ndt\u2032 Tre I\u02c6se , I\u02c6se (t\u2032 \u2212 t), \u03c1s \u2297 \u03c1e ,\n= \u2212i \u0124s , \u03c1s \u2212\ndt\n0\n(13)\nwhere \u03c1s the reduced density matrix of the spin-system\nand I\u02c6se (t), the system bath interaction in the interaction\npicture reads,\nI\u02c6se (t) = ei(\u0124s +\u0124e )t I\u02c6se e\u2212i(\u0124s +\u0124e )t ,\n\n(14)\n\nthe time dependence of which can be computed in the\neigenbasis of \u0124s and \u0124e .

The main idea here is to assign a Boltzmann factor\nto each pair of neighboring energy levels. The spectraltemperature then simply is the average over all these\nfactors weighed by the corresponding occupation probabilities. This spectral-temperature also exists in nonequilibrium situations but coincides with the standard\ndefinition of temperature (e. g. [19]) only for a canonical\nstate.\nFor the calculation of the spectral-temperatures according to (23) we insert for Wn the long time average\nh\u03c1nn\ns (t)it of the respective occupation probability.\n\n4000\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nWe will use as a measure to characterize the asymptotic\nstate of the spin system and the single spins a \"spectraltemperature\" defined as\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\n1\nW0 + WM\n:= \u2212 1 \u2212\nkB T\n2\n(23)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nM\nX\nWn + Wn\u22121 ln Wn \u2212 ln Wn\u22121\n,\n2\nEn \u2212 En\u22121\nn=1\n\n2000\n\n(24)\n\nThe initial state |\u03c8tot (t0 )i has been taken as a product\nstate of the spin chain and the environment. From the\ndensity matrix \u03c1tot (t) = |\u03c8(t)i h\u03c8(t)| we trace out the\nenvironment and transform the resulting reduced density\nmatrix into the eigenbasis of the spin-system. The time\nevolution of this reduced density matrix \u03c1s (t) is plotted\n\nBoth evolutions have been obtained with the coupling\nparameters \u03ba = 0.001 and \u03bb = 0.4. The horizontal lines\nare the probabilities as expected from (11). As can be\nseen, for both internal couplings, the spin-system relaxes\ninto a state which is in accordance with (11). The probability fluctuations can be interpreted as a finite size effect\nof the environment.\nGlobal and local Temperatures: Now that we have\ndemonstrated the relaxation of the spin-chain into a thermal equilibrium state, we want to analyze the relaxation\nbehavior of the spin-chain depending on the internal interaction strength \u03bb. The approach of II C is independent of the internal structure of the small system. Thus\n\n\f5\nthe relaxation behavior should be independent of \u03bb and\nthe temperature of the spin-chain should be identical to\nthat induced by the environment T e = ln12 (see (7)). To\nspecify the temperature of the spin-chain T s we use the\n\"spectral-temperature\" defined in (23). We compare the\nspectral-temperature of the total spin-chain to those of\neach individual spin. For the local spectral-temperature\nT\u03bcloc of a single spin, (23) reduces to\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nT\u03bcloc = \u2212\n\nE1\u03bc \u2212 E0\u03bc\n,\nln(W1\u03bc ) \u2212 ln(W0\u03bc )\n\n(25)\n\nwhere Wi\u03bc is the long time average of the probability to\nfind the \u03bc-th spin at the energy Ei\u03bc . These quantities\nare plotted as a function of \u03bb for a random interaction\nin Fig. 4 and for an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction in Fig. 5.\n\nmore and more with increasing \u03bb although the whole\nspin-system continues to reach a canonical state [12].\nEspecially for a Heisenberg coupled spin chain one\ncan verify analytically that for a canonical state with\nsome respective temperature, the local temperatures deviate more and more with increasing \u03bb (see Sec. IV).\nNote, that for a ferromagnetic Heisenberg coupling the\nspectral-temperatures of each spin show a different behavior: they decrease with increasing \u03bb. In any case,\nthey deviate from T e .\nTo verify that the state of the total spin-chain \u03c1s is\nindeed canonical we test the off-diagonal elements. All\nabsolute values are smaller than 10\u22124 . Therefore we argue that the state of the total spin-chain is indeed a\ncanonical one for all practical purposes and its spectraltemperature can be identified as the thermodynamic temperature.\n\n2.3\n\nThe deviation of the local spectral-temperatures from\nthe temperature of the whole spin-chain can also be understood by analyzing the correlation C between the\nspins\n\n2.2\n\nkB T [\u2206E]\n\n2.1\n2\n1.9\n\nloc\nT2\n\n1.8\n1.7\n\nloc\nT3\n\n1.6\n\nloc\nT1\n\nTs\n1.5\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n\u03bb[\u2206E s ]\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\nFIG. 4: Global and local temperatures as a function of \u03bb for\na random interaction.\n\n8\n\nC\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n0.1\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nTe\n\n1.4\n\nn\no\n2\nC = Tr [h\u03c11 (t)it \u2297 h\u03c12 (t)it \u2297 h\u03c13 (t)it \u2212 h\u03c1s (t)it ] .\n(26)\nThe brackets hit denote the time average of the density\nmatrices of the single spins (\u03c1\u03bc ) and the spin system (\u03c1s ).\nDue to increasing \u03bb the spins are more and more correlated.

C increases with increasing \u03b2 and \u03bb in the antiferromagnetic\ncase as one would expect because of the entanglement in\nthe spin-chain for low temperatures. For the ferromagnetic coupling one can see a bump depending on \u03b2 and \u03bb.\nFor low temperatures (large \u03b2) C decreases and vanish\nfor T = 0.\nPresently it is not quite clear why this bump occurs in\nthe ferromagnetic case for intermediate temperatures. It\ncan be shown, that the crest of the ferromagnetic bump\nis a function of \u03b2 and \u03bb. The behavior for high temperatures is the same for the ferromagnetic as well as the\nantiferromagnetic case: C is vanishing because the local\nstates and the global state will be a totally mixed one.\n\nANALYTICAL RESULTS\n\nFinally we want to compare the numerical results\nshown before with the analytic solutions for the Heisenberg coupled spin-chain. We start from a density-matrix\n\u03c1S (\u03b2, \u03bb) for the whole spin-chain in a canonical state.\nTransforming \u03c1S (\u03b2, \u03bb) into the product basis, one can get\nthe reduced density matrices of the single spins \u03c1\u03bc (\u03b2, \u03bb).\nWe have calculated the local spectral-temperature for\neach spin using (23) in dependence of \u03b2 and \u03bb. The result\nis shown in Fig. 12 (with the same global inverse temperature \u03b2 = ln 2 as for the numerical calculations) and is\nin good agreement with our numerical results (compare\nwith Fig. 5 and Fig. 11, respectively).\n\nloc and T loc\nT1\n3\n\nkB T [\u2206E]\n\n8\n\n0.6\n\n7\nloc\nT2\n\n0.4\n\n6\n\nC\n\n5\n\n0.2\n\n4\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n3\n\nag replacements\n\nC\n\n2\n\n-0.2\n\n3\n2\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\u03bb[\u2206E s ]\n\n1\n-0.4\n\n0\n1\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n1\n-1\n\n0\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03bb[\u2206E s ]\n\nFIG. 12: Analytical results for local spectral-temperatures\nwith the global inverse temperature \u03b2 = ln 2 as function of\n\u03bb for ferromagnetic (\u03bb < 0) and antiferromagnetic (\u03bb > 0)\nHeisenberg coupling.\n\nTo analyze the analytical solution for the correlationmeasure C(\u03b2, \u03bb) we have used again (26) with the analytical density matrices \u03c1S (\u03b2, \u03bb) and \u03c1\u03bc (\u03b2, \u03bb). Fig. 13\nshows C(\u03b2, \u03bb) for the global inverse temperature \u03b2 = ln 2.\nAgain the analytical result is in very good accordance\n\nFIG. 14: Correlations C as function of \u03b2 and \u03bb for ferromagnetic (\u03bb < 0) and antiferromagnetic (\u03bb > 0) Heisenberg\ncoupling.\n\nNote that C is not an entanglement measure. C checks\nwhether \u03c1S (\u03b2, \u03bb) is factorisable by the reduced density\nmatrices \u03c1\u03bc (\u03b2, \u03bb). Therefore C \u2265 0 in the ferromagnetic\ncase for T > 0 indicates on one hand that the product\nbasis differs from the eigenbasis of the spin-chain [11]\n(which is a pure quantum mechanical effect) and otherwise whether a local thermodynamical description is\npossible.\n\n\f8\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nThe main motivation of this paper has been to analyze the thermodynamic behavior of one part (\"the\nsystem\") within a bipartite quantum system subject to\nSchr\u00f6dinger evolution. Such effective relaxation to equilibrium is predicted to occur under rather general conditions. Nevertheless deviations are not excluded. Here\nwe have been interested in (spatially) selective systemenvironment couplings and in the effect of further partitioning of the system under consideration.\nFor this purpose we have studied a spin-chain consisting of three interacting spins coupled locally to a quantum environment. Two different spin-spin-coupling types\nhave been examined: a random and a Heisenberg coupling. For both we have solved the exact Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation and analyzed the reached equilibrium states.\nWe showed that the spin system relaxes into a thermal\nequilibrium state, which is in accordance with the state\none would expect from quantum thermodynamics. Temporal fluctuations persist, though, and are a result of the\nstill comparatively small environment.\nThe spin chain always reaches the predicted state independently of the internal coupling type and strength.\nThus we can conclude, that the internal structure of a\nsmall system as well as locality of the coupling to a quantum environment does not effect the relaxation behavior.\nThe results also show that the overall state reached is a\ncanonical one and thus the spectral-temperature of the\ntotal spin chain can be identified as the \"real\" (thermo-\n\n[1] J. v.

So our conclusion is\nthat for stronger internal couplings the local spin states\nare non-thermal states [21], indicating that the global\ntemperature ceases to be available also locally.\nFor the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain, we\nhave found that single spins are approximately in thermal states up to coupling strengths \u03bb \u2248 1.5. This is in\nagreement with the results in [22]. Also the comparison\nwith the analytical solution shows no differences with the\nnumerical results for the reached equilibrium states.\nA further motivation of this paper has been to compare\nthe well-known Markovian master equation approach\nwith the exact Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics. We have found,\nthat in all considered cases both approaches lead to the\nsame asymptotic result, i. e. equilibrium states of canonical form. The analysis of the short time dynamics, e. g.\nthe relaxation times, etc., for the considered approaches\nshould be an interesting topic for future research.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank H.
