Introduction\nRecent analyses of the helioseismic data, from both the\nMichelson Doppler Imager (MDI) instrument on board the\nSOHO spacecraft (Toomre et al. 2000) and the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) project (Antia & Basu\n2000), have provided strong evidence that the previously\nobserved torsional oscillations (e.g. Howard & LaBonte\n1980; Snodgrass, Howard & Webster 1985; Kosovichev &\nSchou 1997; Schou et al. 1998), with periods of about 11\nyears, penetrate into the convection zone to depths of at\nleast 10 percent in radius.\nFurther studies of these data have produced interesting, but rather inconsistent results. In particular, Howe et\nSend offprint requests to: E.

(2000b) find evidence for the presence of similar oscillations near the tachocline situated close to the bottom of\nthe convection zone, but with a markedly shorter period\nof about 1.3 years, whereas Antia & Basu (2000) do not\nfind such oscillations (whilst allowing the possibility that\nmore irregular variations may be present). Whatever the\ntrue dynamical behaviour at these lower levels turns out\nto be, both these results indicate that the variations in\nthe differential rotation can have different dynamical behaviour at the top and the bottom of the solar convection\nzone, with the oscillations at the bottom having either\nsignificantly shorter periods or non\u2013periodic behaviour.\nRecently, spatiotemporal fragmentation/bifurcation\nhas been proposed as a dynamical mechanism to account\nfor the possible multi-mode behaviour in different parts\nof the solar convection zone (Covas et al. 2000a, hereafter\nCTM1). Evidence for this mechanism was found in the\ncontext of a two dimensional axisymmetric mean field\ndynamo model in a spherical shell, with a semi\u2013open\nouter boundary condition, in which the only nonlinearity\nis the action of the azimuthal component of the Lorentz\nforce of the dynamo generated magnetic field on the\nsolar angular velocity. The underlying zero order angular\nvelocity was chosen to be consistent with the recent\nhelioseismic data.\nOur initial study (CTM1) suffered from two major\nshortcomings. The dynamo model employed inevitably\ncontained major approximations, and the zeroth order rotation profile used is bound to include uncertainties, given\nthe uncertainties in the inversion techniques, as well as the\nshort extent in time over which data sets are so far available.\nTo address the first shortcoming, an extensive study\nwas made of the persistence of the fragmentation following\nplausible changes in the details of the dynamo model. This\nstudy showed that the mechanism remains surprisingly\nrobust in presence of a variety of rather severe changes to\nthe model (Covas et al. 2001, hereafter CTM2).\nRegarding the second shortcoming, CTM2 also included a preliminary study, allowing the zero order rotational profile to be given by either the inversion of the MDI\n\n\f2\n\nCovas et al.: Spatiotemporal fragmentation and the solar rotation law\n\ndata reported by Toomre et al (2000) or of the corresponding GONG data (Howe et al 2000b). This also showed the\nmechanism to be robust with respect to such changes to\nthe rotation profile.\nGiven the significant uncertainties that still remain in\nthe helioseismic measurements, especially given the limited length of the data so far available, it is crucial to\nstudy the robustness of the spatiotemporal fragmentation\nmechanism to a wider range of the rotation profiles consistent with the observations.\n2. Zero order rotation profile\nNew measurements of the solar internal rotation with\nSOHO MDI data have been reported recently by\nVorontsov et al (2001), using novel inversion techniques\nthat are quite different from those employed earlier. Results of a 2D inversion confirmed the previous findings that\nthe torsional oscillations (migrating zonal flows) penetrate\ndeep into the convection zone. However, given the limited\naccuracy of the helioseismic data currently available, they\ndid not allow the resolution of these oscillations all the way\ndown to the bottom of the convection zone. The so-called\n1.5D inversion procedure has also been used, which consists in measuring separately the consecutive terms \u03a9i (r)\nin the expansion\n\u03a9(r, \u03b8) =\n\n\u221e\nX\ni=0\n\n\u03a92i+1 (r)\n\ndP2i+1 (cos \u03b8)\nd(cos \u03b8)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere P2i+1 is the (2i + 1)th Legendre polynomial, r is\nthe distance from the centre and \u03b8 is the co\u2013latitude.\nThe 1.5D inversion of Vorontsov et al (2001) was principally targeted at improvement of the spatial resolution\nof the rotation profile near and just below the base of\nthe convection zone, in the tachocline region-the region\nwhere the dynamo mechanism is most sensitive to the rotation profile, since the largest gradients of the angular\nvelocity appear to be localized there.\nAn important feature of the solar internal rotation as\nseen in the helioseismic measurements is that the rapid\nspatial variation of the angular velocity in the tachocline\nis governed principally by the first two or three terms\nin the expansion (1); the contribution of higher terms\nappears to be an order of magnitude smaller, being essentially undetectable in the helioseismic data available\nat present. Another important feature is that this dominant part of the variation of the angular velocity in the\ntachocline with depth and latitude, captured by the first\nfew terms in the expansion (1), does not show any changes\nwith solar activity (Vorontsov et al 2001). Taken together,\nthese two features suggest considering the torsional oscillations as a small-amplitude, rapidly-varying (in \u03b8), timedependent component of the solar rotation, imposed on a\nlarge-amplitude, slowly-varying (in \u03b8), nearly-stationary\ncomponent described by the first terms of the expansion\n(1).\n\nThese considerations show that at least a dominant\npart of the time-independent (background) component of\nsolar rotation can be evaluated by a simple truncation of\nthe expansion (1) to the first two or three terms, making the truncated expansion a natural candidate for the\nzero-order rotation profile in the dynamo modelling. This\nchoice might be more consistent than using a time average\nof the inverted rotation profiles (as in CTM2), since the\nobservational data used in the inversions do not yet cover\nenough (ca. 5 yr) of a complete solar cycle to allow proper\naveraging. With the zero-order profile derived from the\ntime-independent part of the data we can also eliminate\nany possibility that torsional oscillations produced by the\ndynamo model originate from the time varying zonal flows\nalready present (in time-averaged form) in the background\nrotation profile.\nThus we here describe a comparative study of the effects of employing zero order rotation profiles, obtained\nby taking the first two and the first three terms of the expansion (1). These profiles, inferred from the 360d SOHO\nMDI data set, are shown in Fig. 1.\n3. The model\nIn order to test the sensitivity of the spatiotemporal fragmentation with respect to the uncertainties in the rotation\nprofile, we used the following dynamo model, which was\nalso used in CTM1,2. We assume that the gross features\nof the large scale solar magnetic field can be described by\na mean field dynamo model, with the standard equation\n\u2202B\n= \u2207 \u00d7 (u \u00d7 B + \u03b1B \u2212 \u03b7\u2207 \u00d7 B).\n\u2202t\n\n(2)\n\nHere u = v \u03c6\u0302 \u2212 12 \u2207\u03b7, the term proportional to \u2207\u03b7 represents the effects of turbulent diamagnetism, and the velocity field is taken to be of the form v = v0 + v \u2032 , where\nv0 = \u03a90 r sin \u03b8, \u03a90 is a prescribed underlying rotation law\nand the component v \u2032 satisfies\n(\u2207 \u00d7 B) \u00d7 B\n\u2202v \u2032\n=\n.\u03c6\u0302 + \u03bdD2 v \u2032 ,\n\u2202t\n\u03bc0 \u03c1\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\u2202\n1\n\u2202\n\u2202\n2 \u2202\nwhere D2 is the operator \u2202r\n2 + r \u2202r + r 2 sin \u03b8 ( \u2202\u03b8 (sin \u03b8 \u2202\u03b8 ) \u2212\n1\nsin \u03b8 ) and \u03bc0 is the induction constant. The sole nonlinearity in the dynamo equation is the feedback of the azimuthal component of the Lorentz force (Eq. (3)), which\nmodifies only slightly the underlying imposed rotation\nlaw, but nevertheless limits the magnetic fields at finite\namplitude. The assumption of axisymmetry allows the\nfield B to be split simply into toroidal and poloidal parts,\nB = BT + BP = B \u03c6\u0302 + \u2207 \u00d7 A\u03c6\u0302, and Eq. (2) then yields\ntwo scalar equations for A and B.

We note that there is some evidence\nthat the tachocline may be rather narrower than can be\ndirectly resolved by the usual inversion techniques. The\nuncertainties associated with this possibility are difficult\nto assess, but we do note that the appearance of fragmentation appears to be quite robust with respect to changes\nin the model (CTM2). In the following simulations we used\na mesh resolution of 61\u00d7101 points, uniformly distributed\nin radius and latitude respectively.\nIn this investigation, we took the zero order rotation\nprofile \u03a9(r, \u03b8) in the region 0.64 \u2264 r \u2264 1 to be given\nsuccessively by the first two and the first three terms of\nthe series (1) given above.\nFor the alpha-effect, we took \u03b1\u0303 = \u03b1r (r)f (\u03b8), where\nf (\u03b8) = sin4 \u03b8 cos \u03b8 (cf. R\u00fcdiger & Brandenburg 1995) and\n\u03b1r = 1 for 0.7 \u2264 r \u2264 0.8 with cubic interpolation to zero\nat r = r0 and r = 1, with the convention that \u03b1r > 0 and\nR\u03b1 < 0. Also, in order to take into account the likely decrease in the turbulent diffusion coefficient \u03b7 in the overshoot region, we allowed a simple linear decrease from\n\u03b7\u0303 = 1 at r = 0.8 to \u03b7\u0303 = 0.5 in r < 0.7. We note, however,\nthat as was shown in CTM2, these latter details of the\nmodel are unlikely to remove the possibility of spatiotemporal fragmentations.\n\nFig. 1.

Contours are labelled in units\nof nHz.\nand R\u03c9 = \u03a9\u2217 R2 /\u03b70 , and the turbulent Prandtl number\nPr = \u03bd0 /\u03b70 . \u03a9\u2217 is the solar surface equatorial angular velocity and \u03b7\u0303 = \u03b7/\u03b70 . Thus \u03bd0 and \u03b70 are the turbulent\nmagnetic diffusivity and viscosity respectively, R\u03c9 is fixed\nwhen \u03b70 is determined (see Sect. 4), but the value of R\u03b1 is\nmore uncertain. The density \u03c1 is assumed to be uniform.\nGiven the ill\u2013determined nature of boundary conditions in astrophysical settings, we make physically motivated choices following CTM1,2. At inner boundary we\nchose B = 0, ensuring angular momentum conservation,\nand an overshoot\u2013type condition on BP (cf. Moss &\nBrooke 2000). At the outer boundary, we used an open\nboundary condition \u2202B/\u2202r = 0 on B and used vacuum\nboundary conditions for BP (see Kitchatinov et al. (2000)\nand CTM1,2 for motivation).\nEquations (2) and (3) were solved using the code described in Moss & Brooke (2000) (where more details\nare given; see also Covas et al. 2000a) together with the\nabove boundary conditions, over the range r0 \u2264 r \u2264 1,\n0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0. We set r0 = 0.64; with the solar convection\n\n4. Results\nWe calibrated our model so that near marginal excitation the cycle period was about 22 years. This determined\nR\u03c9 = 44000, corresponding to \u03b70 \u2248 3.4 \u00d7 1011 cm2 sec\u22121 ,\ngiven the known values of \u03a9\u2217 and R. With the rotation\nlaw given by the first three terms of (1), the first solutions\nto be excited in the linear theory are limit cycles with\nodd (dipolar) parity with respect to the equator, with\nmarginal dynamo number R\u03b1 \u2248 \u22123.76. The even parity (quadrupolar) solutions are also excited at a similar\nmarginal dynamo number of R\u03b1 \u2248 \u22123.95. These values\ndid not change significantly when the first two terms of\nexpansion (1) were used. It is arguable that the turbulent Prandtl number is of the order of unity, and we set\nPr = 1. For the parameter range that we investigated, the\neven parity solutions can be nonlinearly stable. Given that\nthe Sun is observed to be close to an odd (dipolar) parity state, and that previous experience shows that small\nchanges in the physical model can cause a change between\nodd and even parities in the stable nonlinear solution, we\nchose to impose dipolar parity on our solutions.\nWith these parameter values, each of the rotation profiles considered here produced butterfly diagrams which\nare in qualitative agreement with the observations. The\nmodel also successfully produced torsional oscillations\nthat penetrate into the convection zone, in all cases considered, similar to those deduced from recent helioseismic\n\n\f4\n\nCovas et al.: Spatiotemporal fragmentation and the solar rotation law\n\nplotted in Fig. 3 the radius of the top of the fragmentation\nregion.

Parameter values are R\u03b1 = \u221220.0, Pr = 1.0 and\nR\u03c9 = 44000.\nBoth of the rotation profiles considered here produced\nspatiotemporal fragmentation. As examples, the top and\nthe bottom panels of Fig. 2 show the radial contours of the\nangular velocity residuals \u03b4\u03a9 as a function of time for a cut\nat latitude 30\u25e6 , with the zero order rotation profile given\nby the first two and the first three terms in the expression\n(1), respectively.\nTo test further this robustness, we also used functions \u03a92i+1 (r), i = 0, 1, 2, obtained from an inversion\nwith slightly different regularisation parameters and in\na somewhat different frequency range of the input data\n(Vorontsov et al 2000). We found no qualitative changes\nin the spatiotemporal fragmentation.\nFinally, as a comparison with our previous results obtained by employing the GONG and MDI data, we have\n\nWe have shown that spatiotemporal fragmentation persists even when only the lowest order terms in the Legendre expansion of the inversion for the solar rotation law\nare used. This is important, as these terms appear to be\napproximately time independent (over the scale of a solar cycle), and also dominate the expansion. Indeed, these\nterms really represent the rotation law that should be input to the dynamo code \u2013 in principle solution of Eq. (3)\nshould then determine the variations of \u03a9 over a cycle.\nThus, these results allay worries that the inconsistency of\naveraging the observed rotation law over only a part of a\nsolar cycle might be giving misleading results.\nThe results presented here, together with those of\nCTM1 and CTM2, show spatiotemporal fragmentation to\nbe a very persistent feature of our simulations. This finding suggests that nonlinear dynamo modelling has a real\npotential predictive power, which could lead to a better\nunderstanding of the solar dynamo when longer data sets\nas well as improved analyses of them become available.\nThis in turn, in conjunction with the expected improvements in the helioseismological data, could lead to an improved determination of the properties of the solar interior, including the nature of the tachocline.\nReferences\nAntia H.M., Basu S., 2000, 2000, ApJ, 541, 442\nCovas E., Tavakol R., Moss D., 2000a, A&A 363, L13\n\n\fCovas et al.: Spatiotemporal fragmentation and the solar rotation law\nCovas E., Tavakol R., Moss D., Tworkowski A., 2000b, A&A\n360, L21\nCovas E., Tavakol R., Moss D., 2001, 'Dynamical variations of the differential rotation in the solar convection zone' 2001.
