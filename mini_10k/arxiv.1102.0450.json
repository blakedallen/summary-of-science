Introduction\nThe present work is motivated by the possibility of using the semiconducting phase of yttrium\nhydride in a solar cell. Metal hydrides could be\nvery interesting materials for application in solar\ncells because of the wide range of band gaps covered\nby the different semiconducting phases of hydrides\n[1]. This in combination with the abundance and\nnon-toxicity of these materials make them candidate materials for use in future thin film solar cells\nand even for highly efficient multiple band gap third\ngeneration solar cells.\nYttrium hydride is observed to form three different phases at room temperature and atmospheric\npressure. The metallic solid solution \u03b1-phase, the\nmetallic dihydride \u03b2-phase (YH2 ) and the insulating trihydride \u03b3-phase (YH3 ) [2]. An optical transition is observed during the transformation from\nthe metallic \u03b2-phase to the transparent, insulating\n\u03b3-phase [3]. Studies show that \u03b3-phase yttrium hydride is semiconducting with a band gap of 2.63 eV\n[4], corresponding to a wavelength of 470 nm. Thus\nit could be used in a solar cell for violet to ultraviolet light or as a top cell in a multiple band gap\n\u2217 Corresponding author.

A third possibility is the usage of\nyttrium hydride for antireflection coating for silicon\nsolar cells [5].\nEarlier, yttrium hydride films were prepared by\nhydrogenation of metallic films in a slow process\nthat could take several days. Using a palladium\ncap layer dramatically shortened the process time\n[6]. However, a palladium cap layer is not always\ndesirable, firstly because the layer is light absorbing. Secondly the Pd cap layer method would introduce additional manufacturing steps that would\nnot comply with the high levels of efficiency that are\nnecessary in the production of solar cells. Thirdly,\nPalladium is also an expensive element, which is\nnot desirable to use in low-cost solar cells. A fourth\nissue is the stress that will result from the hydrogenation of metallic films, as a 19.5% volume increase results of the hydrogenation of pure metallic\nyttrium to the semiconducting \u03b3-phase of yttrium\nhydride [4]. The stress from this volume expansion\ncould deteriorate the material quality and constitute a problem for utilization in electronic devices\nsuch as solar cells.\nDeposition of metallic yttrium dihydride films by\nthe use of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) [7] and\nby evaporation of Y under low pressure of H2 [8]\nhas been reported earlier, but we have not found\nreports of direct in-situ deposition of insulating and\nMay 30, 2018\n\n\ftransparent films of \u03b3-phase yttrium hydride.\n2. Experimental methods\nYttrium hydride (YHx ) films were deposited using pulsed DC magnetron sputtering in a Leybold\nOptics A550V7 in-line sputtering system. A metallic yttrium target (99.99%) was used with argon\n(purity: 5N) and hydrogen (6N) gas in the chamber during deposition. The chamber was pumped\ndown to 10\u22126 mbar between the depositions. The\ndepositions were done at pressures from 2 \u00d7 10\u22123\nto 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 mbar. The DC power of the sputter\nwas varied from 100 to 1000 W and pulsed at a\nfrequency of 70 kHz with a reverse cycle of 4 \u03bcs.\nPulsed DC magnetron sputtering (PDC) is used to\navoid arcing and building up charge on the surface\nof the target, as the target can become insulating\nfor high hydrogen injection levels [9]. The hydrogen to argon flow rate was varied from pure argon\nto a 1:1 ratio between the hydrogen and argon flow\nrates. Films were deposited on glass (26 mm \u00d7 76\nmm) and quartz (Suprasil, 10 mm \u00d7 20 mm) substrates. The thickness of the deposited films were\nfrom 100 nm to 2.6 \u03bcm.\nWe did ex-situ characterization of the electrical,\noptical, structural and compositional properties of\nthe samples. The thickness of the samples was determined by using profilometry. Electrical resistivity was determined by a four-point probe measurement setup. The optical transmission and reflection of the films were measured by an Ocean Optics\nspectrometer setup with a halogen lamp supported\nby a deuterium lamp for increased intensity in the\nultraviolet region. Reflection measurements were\ndone with an integrating sphere to collect both diffuse and specularly reflected light.\nStructural characterization was done by X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) using a Bruker-Siemens D5000\ndiffractometer with Cu K\u03b1 radiation in \u03b8-2\u03b8 , parallel beam geometry. The diffraction data were\nanalysed by the Rietveld whole-profile refinement\nmethod [10] using the General Structure Analysis\nSystem (GSAS) software [11]. The peak shapes\nwere described using pseudo-Voigt-type function.\nPreferred orientation was modelled by the MarchDollase method [12].\n\nFigure 1: A photograph of yttrium hydride films deposited\non glass. Vertical lines visible on the samples visualize the\nreflection, whereas the horizontal lines on the background\nvisualize the transmission of the samples. a) A 440 nm thick\ntransparent yttrium hydride film. The appearance of this\nsample resembles that of the \u03b3-phase, but as explained in\nthe text, the crystal structure differs from the normal \u03b3phase. The film has high transmission of light, but appears\nyellowish due to the absorption of blue and green light with\nphoton energies above the band gap. b) A 380 nm thick\nblack yttrium hydride film deposited with reactive hydrogen\nin the process. This sample is mainly composed of the \u03b2phase of yttrium hydride. c) A 370 nm thick yttrium metal\nfilm deposited without hydrogen.\n\nposited by varying the hydrogen flow during deposition. For zero or low hydrogen flow, metallic\n\u03b1-phase yttrium films were obtained. For higher hydrogen flow ratios, black or transparent films were\nformed. Figure 1 shows the visual appearance of the\nthree different classes of films obtained from the experiments. The black films were conductive with a\nresistivity in the order of 10\u22123 \u03a9cm, approximately\none order of magnitude higher than our measurements for metallic yttrium films. The transparent\nfilms were found to be highly insulating, with resistivity in the order of 104 \u03a9cm.\n3.1. Optical properties\nThe reflection and transmission for one of the\ntransparent samples deposited on a quartz substrate is displayed in Figure 2a. The data shows an\nabsorption edge between 2.5 and 3 eV. For visible\nlight with photon energy h\u03bd < 2.5 eV (wavelength\n\n3. Results and discussion\nFilms of metallic yttrium, metallic yttrium hydride and insulating yttrium hydride were de2\n\n\fphoton energies above the band gap, which is close\nto what is found for materials that are utilized in\nthin film solar cells [15]. With such a high absorption a thin layer of one to two micrometer of absorber material is sufficient to absorb most of the\nphotons with energy higher than the band gap in a\nsolar cell.\nThe optical band gap can be found by extrapolating the linear region of the plotted values of (\u03b1h\u03bd)m\nas a function of the photon energy h\u03bd. m = 1/2 for\nindirect band gap transitions or amorphous materials, and m = 2 for direct band gap transitions. The\nextrapolated line crosses the h\u03bd-axis at the band\ngap energy Eg [16]. For the data presented in Figure 2a, we found an indirect optical band gap of\n2.6 eV. All transparent samples had band gap values in the range 2.2-2.7 eV. This is in accordance\nwith the band gap Eg = 2.63 eV van Gogh et al.\n[4] found for an epitaxial \u03b3-phase yttrium hydride.\nThey also mentioned that the band gap of polycrystalline films varied in the range 2.3-2.7 eV. Fitting our data for a direct band gap gives a value\napproximately 0.5 eV higher than for the indirect\nband gap.\nFigure 2b shows the reflection and transmission\ndata obtained for a black film. The reflectivity is\nlow, around 10-15%, over the entire measured spectrum. The minima in reflection at 1.6 eV and 3.5 eV\nare not interference fringes, but can be attributed to\nthe inherent reflectivity of yttrium dihydride. The\nsame minima were found for the reflection of light\non thin yttrium dihydride films prepared by hydrogenation of yttrium, in the work of Sakai et al. [17].\nThe transmission is very low, but a transmission\nwindow with a peak value at 1.7 eV lets up to 0.5%\nof the light through. This transmission window is\nalso characteristic for the metallic \u03b2-phase of yttrium hydride [4, 17].\nFor reference, the reflection and transmission\nspectra of an oxidized yttrium sample are also presented in Figure 2c. This is to show that the strong\nabsorption above 2.6 eV seen in Figure 2a is because of the hydride and is not related to the substrate or oxidized regions of the deposited yttrium\nhydride film. The oxidized yttrium was prepared\nby annealing a metallic yttrium film at 850 \u25e6 C for\n2 minutes in air. The thickness of the sputter deposited yttrium film was 145 nm before, and 165\nnm after annealing. Notice the absorption edge at\n5.6 eV, close to the band gap of Y2 O3 .\nWe have not been able to quantify the hydrogen content of our samples, but comparation of the\n\n1 0 0\n\n( a ) T r a n s p a r e n t s a m p le\n\nR , T [% ]\n\n9 0\n8 0\n\nR\n\n7 0\n\nT\n\n6 0\n5 0\n4 0\n3 0\n2 0\n1 0\n0\n1 .5\n\n2 .0\n\n2 .5\n\n3 .0\n\n3 .5\n4 .0\nh \u03bd[e V ]\n\n4 .5\n\n5 .0\n\n5 .5\n\n6 .0\n\n2 0\n\n( b ) B la c k s a m p le\n\n1 8\n\nR\n\nR , T [% ]\n\n1 6\nT\n\n1 4\n1 2\n\n0 .4\n0 .2\n0 .0\n1 .5\n\n2 .0\n\n2 .5\n\n3 .0\n\n3 .5\n4 .0\nh \u03bd[e V ]\n\n4 .5\n\n5 .0\n\n5 .5\n\n6 .0\n\n1 0 0\n\n( c ) O x id iz e d y ttr iu m\n\nR , T [% ]\n\n9 0\n8 0\n\nR\n\n7 0\n\nT\n\n6 0\n5 0\n4 0\n3 0\n2 0\n1 0\n0\n1 .5\n\n2 .0\n\n2 .5\n\n3 .0\n\n3 .5\n4 .0\nh \u03bd[e V ]\n\n4 .5\n\n5 .0\n\n5 .5\n\n6 .0\n\nFigure 2: Reflection and transmission for films deposited on\nquartz substrates. a) For a 280 nm thick transparent yttrium\nhydride film. b) Reflection and transmission for a 360 nm\nthick black yttrium hydride film.

For comparison we here also present the reflection and\ntransmission spectra of c) an 165 nm thick oxidized yttrium\nfilm.\n\n\u03bb > 500 nm), the films are highly transparent. The\nlow absorption is exceptional for yttrium hydride\nthin films, Pd-covered YH3 films with comparable\nthicknesses are normally observed to absorb up to\n80% of the light even for photon energies smaller\nthan the band gap [4, 13, 14]. The oscillations in\nthe reflection and transmission are due to interference effects, and can be modelled with a film with\na thickness 280 nm and a refractive index n \u2248 2.3.\nThe absorption coefficient can be estimated from\nthe reflection and transmission data from the approximation \u03b1 = d\u22121 ln[(1 \u2212 R)/T ], where d is the\nthickness of the film, and R and T are the measured\nreflection and transmission, respectively. Using this\nformula we find that the present films have a high\nabsorption coefficient in the order of 105 cm\u22121 for\n3\n\n\fgrowth in the h100i-direction for the transparent\nsample. Rietveld-type whole-profile fitting of the\nXRD data was performed where the preferred orientation was described using March-Dollase models\nchoosing the (111) plane as preferred orientation\nplane for the black sample and the (100) plane for\nthe transparent sample. To describe the asymmetry\nin the peaks observed for the transparent sample,\na secondary cubic YH2 phase with size-broadened\npeaks (nano-sized grains) was added to the refinements. The residua Rwp of all the presented fits\nwere less than 8%.\nThe diffraction patterns of the transparent and\nthe black yttrium hydride films correspond to a fcc\nstructure with lattice parameters atransp = 5.35 \u00c5\nand ablack = 5.26 \u00c5. These values were representative for all our transparent and black samples.\nThis corresponds to molar volume of 23.05 cm3 for\nthe transparent sample and 21.9 cm3 for the black\nsample.\nIf we assume that the composition of the transparent samples is close to YH3 , the expanded unit\ncell in comparison with the black sample (YH2 ) is\nin agreement with the findings of van der Molen et\nal. [19], who found that the fcc unit cell expanded\nfrom a = 5.20 \u00c5 to 5.28 \u00c5 when going from fcc YH2\nto fcc YH3 . Tkacz et al. found the same unit cell\nparameter a = 5.28 \u00c5 for a high-pressure fcc phase\nof YH3 at 8 GPa. In the work of van Gogh et al. [4]\non La1\u2212z Yz Hx one may perform an extrapolation\nof the data on the fcc films to obtain a lattice parameter of a = 5.33 \u00c5 for stoichiometric YH3 films\nin the fcc structure [19].\nAs mentioned earlier, the optical transmission\nand reflection of the black samples resemble what\nis found for yttrium dihydride. For stoichiometric YH2 (\u03b2-phase), a = 5.20 \u00c5 is found for both\nbulk samples at room temperature [2] and thin films\n[4]. The larger unit cell parameter we found for the\nblack samples indicate that the composition differ\nfrom stoichiometric YH2 . Both differences in hydrogen content and the presence of oxygen may influence the unit cell parameter.\n\noptical measurements to similar studies [4, 17, 18]\ngives a strong indication that the transparent samples have a composition close to YH3 and the black\nsamples have a composition close to YH2 .\n3.2. Structural properties\nThe crystal structures of the three phases of yttrium hydride are well known from the literature [2];\nthe \u03b1-phase (yttrium metal/solid solution) crystallizes with a hcp structure, the \u03b2-phase (YH2 ) with\nfcc and the transparent \u03b3-phase (YH3 ) with a hcp\nstructure. However, we found that the structures\nof the transparent and the black films were almost\nindistinguishable. They were both found to form\nan fcc structure, with a small shift in the lattice\nparameter. The metallic yttrium films deposited\nwithout hydrogen were found to be in the expected\nhcp structure.\nWe were surprised to find the transparent film\nwith the fcc structure, but it was not completely\nunexpected. Firstly, the very similar hydride of lanthanum shows an optical transition from metallic to\ntransparent upon hydrogenation which is not accompanied by any structural transition from fcc to\nhcp lattice [3, 4]. Secondly, a hydrogen-induced optical transition without change in crystal structure\nhas also been observed for hydrogenated nanocrystalline PLD-grown yttrium dihydride films [7]. A\nthird similar finding was reported by Van der Molen\net al. [19], who found that transparent yttrium hydride films were stabilized in the fcc structure by\nthe addition of magnesium. Their coevaporated\nYz Mg1\u2212z films maintained the fcc structure after\nswitching from metallic to transparent when the\nMg content was higher than z = 0.1. They found\nthe optical properties to be similar for fcc and hcp\nfilms. In addition, a structural transition for YH3\nfrom hcp to fcc under high pressures (several GPa)\nhas also been predicted [20] and observed for bulk\nYH3 samples [21].\nFigures 3a and 3b display XRD patterns and\nRietveld-type whole-profile refinements for a transparent and a black sample deposited on a glass substrate. The crystal planes from which the Bragg\npeaks originate is indicated on the figure, according to an F m3m space group with the corresponding lattice parameter. For comparison, the XRD\npattern of an Y2 O3 film is also shown in Figure\n3c. There is a noticeable difference in the intensity distribution over the peaks for the two hydride\nsamples in Figures 3a and 3b. A reasonable explanation of this is that there is more orientational\n\n3.3. Oxygen content in samples\nThe films prepared in this study were not capped\nby Pd, as usually done when yttrium hydride films\nare prepared by metal deposition and post process\nhydrogenation. Therefore, we have no surface protection against oxidation. Yttrium forms a stable\noxide, and is known to dissociate water or oxygen\nfrom air to form yttrium oxide (Y2 O3 ). The present\n4\n\n\fsamples were kept in air and no visible degradation\nwas observed, even after several months of storage.\nSome surface oxidation should be expected, but it\nis likely that this oxidation will affect a very thin\nlayer, as the oxide itself forms a barrier for further\noxidation [22].\n\n3 0\n\n4 0\n\n5 0\n\n(3 1 1 )\n\n7 0\n\n8 0\n\n9 0\n\n2 + \u03b5\n\n(4 4 0 )\n\n(5 1 1 )\n\n(4 2 2 )\n\n(4 0 0 )\n\n6 0\n\n(3 3 1 )\n(4 2 0 )\n\n(2 2 0 )\n2 0\n\nIt is difficult to distinguish Y2 O3 from the \u03b2phase of yttrium hydride by XRD. Yttrium oxide\nforms a bcc lattice with a lattice parameter of 10.60\n= 2\u00d75.30 \u00c5 [23], and can therefore give a XRD pattern that is similar to the XRD measurements for\nthe black and transparent samples (Fig. 3). However, the optical behavior of Y2 O3 is very different\nfrom what we observed (Fig. 2), as Y2 O3 is transparent with an optical band gap of 5.5 eV [23]. It\nis therefore probable that transparent yttrium hydride is responsible for the observed optical properties.\n\nI( e x p )\nI( c a lc )\nY H 2+\u03b4\nn a n o -Y H\n\n(2 2 2 )\n\n(2 0 0 )\n\n(1 1 1 )\n\nlo g ( C o u n ts [a r b . u n its ])\n\n( a ) T r a n s p a r e n t s a m p le\n\n1 0 0\n\n1 1 0\n\n4 0\n\nL o g ( c o u n ts [a r b . u n its ])\n\n5 0\n\n6 0\n\n7 0\n\n2 \u03b8\n\n8 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nFilms with capping layers of yttrium, aluminum\nand molybdenum were also prepared. The capping\nlayers were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering,\non top of the hydride films without any air exposure\nin between the depositions. Similar structural results were obtained for these films, but the optically\ntransparent state was only seen with the Mo capping. For yttrium, the reason for not obtaining the\ntransparent film could be that hydrogen easily diffuses into the yttrium cap layer, and leaves the sample in the metallic dihydride state. The aluminium\ncap layer reacted with the underlying yttrium hydride film, and is not suitable as capping layer for\nthis kind of sample. The Mo cap layer did not react with the sample, and from samples deposited on\nglass we could observe the transparent sample below a 150 nm thick capping layer of molybdenum.\nFor molybdenum, formation of hydride is known to\nhappen only at pressures of several kbar [24], so\nwe assume that the Mo layer does not absorb any\nhydrogen from the underlying film.\n\n(4 4 0 )\n\n(4 2 2 )\n9 0\n\n(5 1 1 )\n\n(3 3 1 )\n(4 2 0 )\n\n(3 1 1 )\n(2 2 2 )\n\n(2 2 0 )\n\n(4 0 0 )\n3 0\n\n(2 2 2 )\n\n2 0\n\nI( e x p )\nI( c a lc )\nY H 2+\u03b4\n\n( b ) B la c k s a m p le\n\n(2 0 0 )\n\nlo g ( C o u n ts [a r b . u n its ])\n\n(1 1 1 )\n\n2 \u03b8\n\n1 1 0\n\nI( e x p )\nI( c a lc )\nY 2O 3\n\n( c ) O x id iz e d y ttr iu m\n\n*Y\n\n2 0\n\n3 0\n\n4 0\n\n5 0\n\n6 0\n\n2 \u03b8\n\n7 0\n\n8 0\n\n9 0\n\n1 0 0\n\n1 1 0\n\nFigure 3: Rietveld-type fits and XRD patterns collected\nat room temperature (\u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5) showing observed\n(squares) and calculated (line) values in the upper panes (log\nscale) and the difference between the observed and calculated\nvalues in the lower panes (linear scale).

The thicknesses of the films from\nwhich these XRD data were obtained, were 2.6 \u03bcm, 2.8 \u03bcm\nand 240 nm, respectively.\n\nIt is also probable that oxygen can be incorporated in the films during the deposition process.\nAn exact determination of the oxygen and hydrogen\ncontent of the samples is not a straightforward task,\nand we are currently working on a quantification of\nthe actual oxygen and hydrogen concentration in\nthe samples. A preliminary analysis show that the\noxygen content in the samples is between 5 and 30\nat%. A full analysis of the oxygen and hydrogen\ncontent will be the subject of a subsequent paper\nfrom our group.\n5\n\n\f3.4. Yttrium hydride as a solar cell material\nAs to the suggested application of metal hydrides\nin solar cells, some sort of internal electric field has\nto be set up in a semiconductor to separate the\ngenerated charge carriers. This is normally done\nby setting up a p-n junction by introducing different impurities in a single semiconducting material\n(homojuction), or by depositing different semiconducting materials with different doping in a stack\n(heterojunction) [15]. In either case a careful study\nof the electric properties of semiconducting yttrium\nhydride needs to be done before proceeding to make\nmore complex device structures implementing yttrium hydride. Some work on electrical properties\nhas been done [6, 18], but it is uncertain if these\nresults are also valid for our in-situ prepared films\nthat exhibit a cubic crystal structure.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.

Conclusion\nFilms of metallic yttrium, metallic black yttrium\nhydride and insulating transparent yttrium hydride\nwere deposited in-situ by using PDC sputtering of\na metallic yttrium target in an atmosphere of argon and hydrogen. This method differs from other\nmethods for preparation of yttrium hydride films\nin that it is a direct deposition technique that requires no post deposition hydrogenation step and\nthat no palladium cap is needed. This could be advantageous when optical and electrical parameters\nare important. The insulating, or semiconducting,\nfilms were highly transparent for light with photon\nenergy below the band gap. We found an indirect\noptical band gap of 2.2-2.7 eV for our samples.\nThe transparent samples are observed to have a\ncubic fcc structure, which is interesting from a fundamental point of view, as high quality transparent\nfilms of cubic yttrium hydride at ambient pressure\nhave earlier only been achieved by stabilization of\nthe films by the addition of magnesium. The level\nof oxidation of the films is not determined, but experiments with capping of the deposited films with\nmolybdenum show that the transparent state is also\nachievable for films that have not been exposed to\nair.\nAcknowledgements\nFunding from the Norwegian Research Council\nthrough the NANOMAT program is acknowledged.\nWe also thank professor R. Griessen, Netherlands,\nfor fruitful discussions of our results.\n6\n\n\f[19]\n\n[20]\n\n[21]\n\n[22]\n\n[23]\n\n[24]\n\ntrical and optical properties of epitaxial YHx switchable\nmirrors, J.
