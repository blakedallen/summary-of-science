Suppose a locally compact group G acts freely and properly on a locally\ncompact Hausdorff space X, and let \u03b3 be the induced action on C0 (X). We consider\na category in which the objects are C \u2217 -dynamical systems (A, G, \u03b1) for which there\nis an equivariant homomorphism of (C0 (X), \u03b3) into the multiplier algebra M (A).\nRieffel has shown that such systems are proper and saturated, and hence have a\ngeneralized fixed-point algebra A\u03b1 which is Morita equivalent to A\u00d7\u03b1,r G. We show\nthat the assignment (A, \u03b1) 7\u2192 A\u03b1 is functorial, and that Rieffel's Morita equivalence\nis natural in a suitable sense. We then use our results to prove a categorical version\nof Landstad duality which characterizes crossed products by coactions, and to prove\nthat Mansfield imprimitivity for crossed products by homogeneous spaces is natural.\n\nIntroduction\nAn action \u03b1 of a locally compact group G on a non-unital C \u2217 -algebra A typically\nhas very few fixed-points, but there has nevertheless been considerable interest in\nsituations where one can find a reasonable analogue of the fixed-point algebra inside\nthe multiplier algebra M(A) [24, 5, 14, 25, 8]. To see what one might hope to achieve,\nconsider the action \u03b3 of G on C0 (X) induced by an action of G on a locally compact\nspace X. When G acts properly on X, the orbit space X/G is locally compact\nand Hausdorff, and the algebra C0 (X/G) behaves much like a fixed-point algebra\nfor the system. For example, if G acts freely as well as properly on X, then a\ntheorem of Green [6] says that C0 (X/G) is Morita equivalent to the crossed product\nC0 (X) \u00d7\u03b3 G. The crucial feature of this situation is that there is a dense \u03b3-invariant\n\u2217-subalgebra Cc (X) where\nR one can average functions f over the orbits to obtain a\nfunction E(f ) : x * G 7\u2192 G f (x * t) dt in C0 (X/G).\nThere are many other situations in which variations of Green's construction yield\nuseful Morita equivalences. In search of a systematic approach to such equivalences,\nRieffel studied a family of proper actions (A, \u03b1) for which there is a dense invariant\n\u2217-subalgebra A0 with properties like those of the subalgebra Cc (X) of (C0 (X), \u03b3), and\nfor which there is a generalized fixed-point algebra A\u03b1 in M(A) [24]. He also identified\na class of saturated proper actions for which A\u03b1 is Morita equivalent to the reduced\nDate: 17 December 2007.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Rieffel's theory was developed\nwith some new examples in mind [23], and it has since had other applications (see,\nfor example, [1], [12] and [17]). In particular, an Huef and Raeburn have used Rieffel's\nresults to extend Mansfield's imprimitivity theorem for crossed products by coactions\nto crossed products by homogeneous spaces [7].\nOn the face of it, Rieffel's generalized fixed-point algebra A\u03b1 and the associated\nMorita equivalence depend on the choice of dense subalgebra A0 . However, Rieffel\nsubsequently showed in [25, Theorem 5.7] that if G acts properly on X and there\nis an equivariant homomorphism \u03c6 : (C0 (X), \u03b3) \u2192 (A, \u03b1), then \u03b1 is proper in the\nsense of [24] with respect to A0 = span Cc (X)ACc (X). In the light of the work of the\nfirst two authors in [9], Rieffel's hypothesis says that the system (A, \u03b1) belongs to a\ncomma category associated to the system (C0 (X), \u03b3), and his theorem says that, for\nsystems in this comma category, there is a canonical choice of dense subalgebra A0 .\nIn this paper we show that when G acts properly on X, Rieffel's generalized fixedpoint algebra gives a functor Fix on the comma category associated to (C0 (X), \u03b3),\nand that when the action of G on X is free, Rieffel's Morita equivalence gives a\nnatural equivalence between Fix and a reduced crossed-product functor. We then give\nseveral applications of these results to nonabelian duality. The first (taking X = G)\nis a categorical version of Landstad duality for coactions [18], which identifies crossed\nproducts by coactions as the dynamical systems which belong to the comma category\nassociated to (C0 (G), \u03b3); our result neatly complements those of [9] for actions, and\nwhen combined with them gives new information about iterated Landstad duality.\nIn our second application, we take (X, G) = (G, H) where H is a closed subgroup of\nG, and deduce that the Morita equivalence implementing the imprimitivity theorem\nfor crossed products by homogeneous spaces in [7] is natural; this result complements\nthe result for coactions of quotient groups in [4, Theorem 4.21].\nWe begin with a short section on preliminaries, in which we introduce (some of) the\ncategories of interest to us. In \u00a72, we investigate an averaging process E developed\nin [18] for use in nonabelian duality. For systems (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) in the comma category,\nwe can average elements f ag of Cc (X)ACc (X), and the elements E(f ag) span a \u2217algebra whose closure we denote by Fix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6). Our first main result (Corollary 2.8)\nsays that Fix extends to a functor on the comma category. In \u00a73, we prove that,\nwhen (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) is an element of the comma category, (A, \u03b1) is proper with respect to\nA0 := span Cc (X)ACc (X) and has Fix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6) as its generalized fixed-point algebra.\nTheorem 3.2 is our main theorem on the naturality of Rieffel's Morita equivalence.\nOur new version of categorical Landstad duality for crossed products by coactions\nis Theorem 4.2. Theorem 3.3 of [18] gives the required result on objects (see Theorem 4.1), so our main task is to extend this to morphisms. As in any project involving\ncoactions, technical choices have to be made: here, the main references of interest to\nus [24, 18, 7] use reduced crossed products and reduced coactions, so in an attempt\nto be user-friendly we have used reduced coactions wherever possible. Nevertheless,\nthere are other options, and we have discussed them briefly in Corollary 4.3 and Remark 5.5, relegating the necessary background details to the Appendix. In \u00a75, we\ncombine our categorical Landstad duality for coactions with the duality for actions\nof [9], and in \u00a76 we apply our results to Mansfield imprimitivity. The Appendix\n\n\fPROPER ACTIONS AND FIXED-POINT ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\ncontains a new categorical version of the relationship between normal and reduced\ncoactions which may be of independent interest, as well as the facts about reduction\nand normalization of coactions needed in the main text.\n1. Preliminaries\nWe begin with a convention: if X and Y are subspaces of a C \u2217 -algebra A, then\nXY denotes the subspace span{xy : x \u2208 X, y \u2208 Y }. If A and B are C \u2217 -algebras,\na homomorphism A \u2192 M(B) is nondegenerate if \u03c6(A)B is dense in B. Such a\nhomomorphism extends uniquely to a unital homomorphism \u03c6 : M(A) \u2192 M(B) (see\n[22, Corollary 2.51], for example), and hence nondegenerate homomorphisms can be\ncomposed. The objects in our basic category C are C \u2217 -algebras, and the morphisms\nfrom one object A to another B are nondegenerate homomorphisms \u03c6 : A \u2192 M(B).\nThroughout this paper, we consider a fixed locally compact group G, and various\ncategories of actions and coactions of G on C \u2217 -algebras. The objects in the category\nA(G) consist of dynamical systems (A, \u03b1) in which \u03b1 is a continuous action of G on\nA, and the morphisms from (A, \u03b1) to (B, \u03b2) are morphisms \u03c6 : A \u2192 B in C such that\n\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b1s = \u03b2s \u25e6 \u03c6 for every s \u2208 G. We will introduce the various categories of coactions\nas they are required.\nBy a \"natural isomorphism\" between two functors we mean exactly the same as we\nmeant by a \"natural equivalence\" in [4]. We now believe that \"natural isomorphism\"\nis the more generally accepted term in category theory.\nLet a be an object in a category C. The comma category a \u2193 C has objects (x, f ),\nwhere f : a \u2192 x is a morphism in C, and a morphism h : (x, f ) \u2192 (y, g) in a \u2193 C is\na morphism h : x \u2192 y in C such that h \u25e6 f = g.\nRemark 1.1. We emphasize that our underlying category C is not the same as the\ncategory denoted by C in [4], which we will denote here by Caug , and refer to as the\naugmented category of C \u2217 -algebras. The objects in Caug are again C \u2217 -algebras, but\nin Caug the morphisms from A to B are isomorphism classes of A-B correspondences\n(called right-Hilbert A-B bimodules in [4]). A morphism \u03c6 : A \u2192 B in C gives rise to\nan A-B correspondence, and hence to a morphism [\u03c6] : A \u2192 B in Caug . Moreover, the\nassignment \u03c6 7\u2192 [\u03c6] gives a functor from C to Caug ; this point will be important in \u00a73\n(see Remark 3.3). While this functor is neither injective nor surjective on morphisms,\nwe do have [\u03c6] = [\u03c8] in Caug if and only if \u03c8 = Ad u \u25e6 \u03c8 for some u \u2208 UM(B) [3,\nProposition 2.3].\n2. Fixed points\nIn this section, we consider a proper right action of G on a locally compact space X,\nthe associated action \u03b3 : G \u2192 Aut C0 (X) given by \u03b3t (f )(x) = f (x * t), and an element\n(A, \u03b1, \u03c6) = ((A, \u03b1), \u03c6) of the comma category (C0 (X), \u03b3) \u2193 A(G). The morphism\n\u03c6 is implemented by a nondegenerate homomorphism \u03c6 : C0 (X) \u2192 M(A), and A\nthus becomes a bimodule over C0 (X); to simplify notation, we often write f ag for\n\u03c6(f )a\u03c6(g). Our goal in this section is to prove that applying the averaging process\nE of [18, Section 3] to the dense subalgebra\n(2.1)\n\nA0 := Cc (X)ACc (X) := span{f ag : f, g \u2208 Cc (X), a \u2208 A}\n\n\f4\n\nKALISZEWSKI, QUIGG, AND RAEBURN\n\nof A gives a C \u2217 -subalgebra Fix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6) := E(A0 ) of M(A), and that this is the object\nmap of a functor Fix from (C0 (X), \u03b3) \u2193 A(G) to C.\nWe begin by recalling the properties of the averaging process of [18, Section 3],\nwhich is based on [15, Section 2] and [16, note added in proof]. Our first comments\napply to arbitrary systems (A, \u03b1) in A(G).\nAs in [18, Definition 3.4], we let p be the set of multipliers a \u2208 M(A)+ such that\nthere exists an element E(a) in M(A)+ satisfying\nZ\n\u03c9(E(a)) = \u03c9(\u03b1s (a)) ds\nfor every positive functional \u03c9 on A. We know from [16, note added in proof] and\n[18, Lemma 3.5] that n := {a \u2208 M(A) : a\u2217 a \u2208 p} is a left ideal in M(A), and that\nm := n\u2217 n is a \u2217-subalgebra of M(A) with m+ = p and m = span p. Corollary 3.6 of\n[18] says that a 7\u2192 E(a) extends to a positive linear map E = E \u03b1 : m \u2192 M(A) such\nthat\nZ\n(2.2)\n\u03c9(E(a)) = \u03c9(\u03b1s (a)) ds for all \u03c9 \u2208 A\u2217 .\nSince n is a left ideal in M(A), we have\nmM(A)m = n\u2217 (nM(A)n\u2217 )n \u2282 n\u2217 M(A)n \u2282 m,\nand for fixed b, c \u2208 m, the map a 7\u2192 E(bac) is norm-continuous on M(A) [18, Corollary 3.6(3)].\nLemma 2.1. If d \u2208 M(A)\u03b1 then for all a \u2208 m we have ad \u2208 m and E(ad) = E(a)d.\nProof. We first claim that nd \u2282 n. Let a \u2208 n, so that a\u2217 a \u2208 p. To show ad \u2208 n we\nneed d\u2217 a\u2217 ad \u2208 p, so by definition of p we need to show that there exists b \u2208 M(A)+\nsuch that\nZ\n\u03c9(b) =\n\n\u03c9(\u03b1s (d\u2217 a\u2217 ad)) ds for all \u03c9 \u2208 A\u2217+ .\n\nWe show that b := d\u2217 E(a\u2217 a)d works. For \u03c9 \u2208 A\u2217+ , we define d * \u03c9 * d\u2217 (b) = \u03c9(d\u2217 bd).\nThen d * \u03c9 * d\u2217 is in A\u2217+ , and hence\n\u03c9(d\u2217 E(a\u2217 a)d) = d * \u03c9 * d\u2217 (E(a\u2217 a))\nZ\n= d * \u03c9 * d\u2217 (\u03b1s (a\u2217 a)) ds\nZ\n= \u03c9(\u03b1s (d\u2217 a\u2217 ad)) ds (because \u03b1s (d) = d).\nNow the formula m = n\u2217 n implies that md \u2282 m, and for a \u2208 m and \u03c9 \u2208 A\u2217 we have\nZ\nZ\n\u03c9(E(ad)) = \u03c9(\u03b1s (ad)) ds = d * \u03c9(\u03b1s (a)) ds\n= d * \u03c9(E(a)) = \u03c9(E(a)d).\n\n\u0003\n\nWe can apply all this to the system (C0 (X), \u03b3). Then for each positive function f in\nthe subalgebra Cc (X) and each x \u2208 X, the function t 7\u2192 f (x * t) has compact support,\nand it follows from Fubini's theorem that f \u2208 p and E(f ) is pointwise multiplication\n\n\fPROPER ACTIONS AND FIXED-POINT ALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\nR\nby the function x 7\u2192 G f (x * t) dt. It follows that Cc (X) \u2282 m, with E(f ) given by\nthe same formula.\nWhen (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) is in the comma category (C0 (X), \u03b3) \u2193 A(G), Proposition 1.4 of\n[20] implies that \u03c6(Cc (X)) \u2282 m. Thus\nCc (X)M(A)Cc (X) \u2282 mM(A)m \u2282 m,\nand the maps a 7\u2192 E(f ag) are norm-continuous for every fixed pair f, g \u2208 Cc (X).\nR We think of the expectation E as being given by a strictly convergent integral\n\u03b1s (a) ds, and then the next lemma says that, when the usual norm-convergent\nA-valued integral also makes sense, the two coincide.\nLemma 2.2. For a \u2208 A and f, g, h \u2208 Cc (X), the function s 7\u2192 f \u03b1s (gah) belongs to\nCc (G, A), and its A-valued integral satisfies\nZ\nf \u03b1s (gah) ds = f E(gah).\nG\n\nProof. We have f \u03b1s (gah) = f \u03b3s (g)\u03b1s (a)\u03b3s (h), and f \u03b3s (g) = 0 unless supp f intersects\n(supp g) * s\u22121 ; since G acts properly on X,\n{s \u2208 G : (supp f ) \u2229 (supp g) * s\u22121 6= \u2205}\nis contained\nin a compact set. Thus s 7\u2192 f \u03b1s (gah) has compact support, and the\nR\nintegral G f \u03b1s (gah) ds gives a well-defined element of A (as in [22, Lemma C.3], for\nexample). Now let \u03c9 \u2208 A\u2217 . Lemma C.3 of [22] also implies that the bounded linear\nfunctional \u03c9 pulls through the integral:\n\u0010Z\n\u0011 Z\n\u03c9\nf \u03b1s (gah) ds =\n\u03c9(f \u03b1s (gah)) ds.\nG\n\nG\n\n\u2217\n\nWe can define \u03c9f \u2208 A by \u03c9f (b) = \u03c9(f b), and then (2.2) gives\nZ\nZ\n\u03c9(f \u03b1s (gah)) ds = \u03c9f (\u03b1s (gah)) ds\n= \u03c9f (E(gah))\n= \u03c9(f E(gah)).\n\u2217\n\nSince \u03c9 \u2208 A was arbitrary, the result follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nSlightly different versions of the next lemma were implicitly used in the proofs of\n[25, Theorem 5.7] and [8, Theorem 4.4].\nLemma 2.3. For a \u2208 A and f, g, h \u2208 Cc (X), there exists k \u2208 Cc (X) such that\nf E(gah) = f E(gah)k.\nIn particular, the subalgebra A0 defined in (2.1) satisfies\nCc (X)E(A0 ) \u2282 A0\n\nand A0 E(A0 ) \u2282 A0 .\n\nProof. Lemma 2.2 implies that there is a compact set K \u2282 G such that f \u03b1s (gah)\nvanishes for s outside a compact set K \u2282 G, so\nZ\nZ\nf E(gah) =\nf \u03b1s (gah) ds =\nf \u03b1s (ga)\u03b3s (h) ds,\nG\n\nK\n\n\f6\n\nKALISZEWSKI, QUIGG, AND RAEBURN\n\nand then the supports of the functions {\u03b3s (h) : s \u2208 K} are all contained in a compact\nset L \u2282 X. We choose k \u2208 Cc (X) which is identically 1 on L. Then \u03b3s (h) = \u03b3s (h)k\nfor all s \u2208 K, and\nZ\nf E(gah) =\nf \u03b3s (g)\u03b1s (a)\u03b3s (h)k ds\nK\n\u0010Z\n\u0011\n=\nf \u03b3s (g)\u03b1s (a)\u03b3s (h) ds k\nK\n\n= f E(gah)k.\nThe two inclusions follow easily.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 2.4. E(A0 ) is a \u2217-subalgebra of M(A) which is contained in M(A)\u03b1 .\nProof. Since E is linear and \u2217-preserving, E(A0 ) is a \u2217-closed linear subspace of M(A).\nIt is easy to check from the defining property (2.2) that each E(a) is invariant under \u03b1.\nTo see that E(A0 ) is closed under multiplication, let a, b \u2208 A and f, g, h, k \u2208 Cc (X).\nLemma 2.3 gives l \u2208 Cc (X) such that gE(hbk) = gE(hbk)l, and then it follows from\nLemma 2.1 that\nE(f ag)E(hbk) = E(f agE(hbk)) = E(f agE(hbk)l).\nTo finish off, observe that E(f agE(hbk)l) is in E(A0 ) because agE(hbk) is in A *\nCc (X) * M(A) \u2282 A.\n\u0003\nDefinition 2.5. For an object (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) of (C0 (X), \u03b3) \u2193 A(G) we define Fix A =\nFix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6) to be the norm closure of E(A0 ) in M(A).\nBy Proposition 2.4, Fix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6) is a C \u2217 -subalgebra of M(A)\u03b1 . Our next goal is to\nprove that Fix extends to a functor from the comma category (C0 (X), \u03b3) \u2193 A(G) into\nC, and for this we need to know that morphisms respect the construction.\nProposition 2.6. Let \u03c3 : (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) \u2192 (B, \u03b2, \u03c8) be a morphism in the comma category\n(C0 (X), \u03b3) \u2193 A(G). Then \u03c3(A0 )E(B0 ) \u2282 B0 , and \u03c3 restricts to a nondegenerate\nhomomorphism \u03c3| of Fix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6) into M(Fix(B, \u03b2, \u03c8)).\nThe proof of nondegeneracy is surprisingly subtle, and depends on some properties\n\u03b3\nof the averaging process for the\nc (X), E (f ) is multipliR system (C0 (X), \u03b3). For f \u2208 C\n\u03b3\ncation by the function x 7\u2192 f (x * s) ds. The expectation E is related to E \u03b1 by [20,\nProposition 1.4], which implies that \u03c6 maps Cc (X) into the subalgebra m \u2282 M(A)\nand satisfies E \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c6 = \u03c6 \u25e6 E \u03b3 . We need the following standard lemma.\nLemma 2.7. For each h \u2208 Cc (X) there exists g \u2208 Cc (X) such that E(g)h = h.\nProof. Let K = supp h, and choose g1 \u2208 Cc (X, [0, \u221e)) such that g1 > 0 on K. Then\nE(g1 ) > 0 on K * G, so there exists g2 \u2208 Cc (X/G) such that g2 = 1/E(g1 ) on K * G.\nThen g := g1 g2 satisfies\nZ\nE(g)(x * G) = g1 (x * s)g2 (x * G) ds = E(g1 )(x * G)g2 (x * G),\nwhich is 1 whenever x \u2208 K.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fPROPER ACTIONS AND FIXED-POINT ALGEBRAS\n\n7\n\nProof of Proposition 2.6. Let f, g \u2208 Cc (X), a \u2208 A, and b \u2208 B0 . By Lemma 2.3, there\nexists h \u2208 Cc (X) such that gE(b) = gE(b)h. Then\n\u03c3(f ag)E(b) = f \u03c3(a)gE(b) = f \u03c3(a)gE(b)h.\nSince Cc (X)E(B0 ) \u2282 B0 by Lemma 2.3, we have gE(b) \u2208 B0 , \u03c3(a)gE(b) \u2208 B, and\nf \u03c3(a)gE(b)h \u2208 B0 , justifying the first assertion.\nNext we claim that \u03c3(E(A0 ))E(B0 ) \u2282 E(B0 ). Indeed, for a \u2208 A0 and b \u2208 B0 , [20,\nProposition 1.4] and Lemma 2.1 give\n\u03c3(E(a))E(b) = E(\u03c3(a))E(b) = E(\u03c3(a)E(b)),\nwhich belongs to E(B0 ) by the first assertion. Taking adjoints gives E(B0 )\u03c3(E(A0 )) \u2282\nE(B0 ). Since E(B0 ) is dense in Fix(B, \u03b2, \u03c8), it follows that E(a) multiplies E(B0 ) =\nFix(B, \u03b2, \u03c8), and \u03c3 maps E(A0 ) into M(Fix(B, \u03b2, \u03c8)); continuity now implies that \u03c3\nmaps Fix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6) into M(Fix(B, \u03b2, \u03c8)).\nTo establish nondegeneracy, let h, k \u2208 Cc (X) and b \u2208 B. By Lemma 2.7, there exists g \u2208 Cc (X) such that E(g)h = h; choose f \u2208 Cc (X) such that f g = g. Lemma 2.3\nimplies that there exists l \u2208 Cc (X) such that gE(hbk) = gE(hbk)l. Then two applications of Lemma 2.1 show that\nE(hbk) = E(E(f g)hbk) = E(f g)E(hbk)\n= E(f gE(hbk)) = E(f gE(hbk)l).\nLemma 2.3 implies that gE(hbk) belongs to B, so the nondegeneracy of \u03c3 implies\nthat there exists a \u2208 A such that gE(hbk) \u2248 \u03c3(a)gE(hbk) in norm in B. Thus, by\nthe continuity of c 7\u2192 E(f cl), we have a norm approximation\nE(hbk) \u2248 E(f \u03c3(a)gE(hbk)l)\n= E(f \u03c3(a)gE(hbk))\n= \u03c3(E(f ag))E(hbk),\nwhere at the last stage we used Lemma 2.1 again. Since E(B0 ) is dense in Fix(B, \u03b2, \u03c8),\nthis approximation implies that \u03c3| is nondegenerate.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.8. Suppose that G acts properly on X, and \u03b3 is the corresponding action\nof G on C0 (X). Then the assignments\n(A, \u03b1, \u03c6) 7\u2192 Fix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6) and \u03c3 7\u2192 \u03c3|\ngive a functor from (C0 (X), \u03b3) \u2193 A(G) to C.\nProof. It is obvious that \u03c3 7\u2192 \u03c3| respects identity morphisms and compositions.\n\n\u0003\n\n3. Naturality of Rieffel's Morita equivalence\nWe again fix a proper right action of G on a locally compact space X, let \u03b3 be the\nassociated action on C0 (X), and consider a system (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) in the comma category\n(C0 (X), \u03b3) \u2193 A(G). The next proposition is a new version of Theorem 5.7 of [25] in\nwhich we use our averaging process E in place of Rieffel's operator-valued weight \u03c8\u03b1 ,\nand thereby identify Rieffel's generalized fixed-point algebra as our Fix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6).\n\n\f8\n\nKALISZEWSKI, QUIGG, AND RAEBURN\n\nProposition 3.1. For any object (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) in (C0 (X), \u03b3) \u2193 A(G), \u03b1 is proper with\nrespect to A0 = Cc (X)ACc (X) in the sense of [24, Definition 1.2]; the generalized\nfixed-point algebra A\u03b1 is Fix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6), and the right inner product on A0 is given by\nha, biR = E(a\u2217 b).\nProof. The nondegeneracy of \u03c6 implies that the \u2217-subalgebra A0 is dense in A, and\nit is obviously \u03b1-invariant. For a, b \u2208 A0 the map s 7\u2192 a\u03b1s (b\u2217 ) is in Cc (G, A), which\nimplies that both s 7\u2192 a\u03b1s (b\u2217 ) and s 7\u2192 a\u03b1s (b\u2217 )\u2206(s)\u22121/2 are in L1 (G, A), as required\nin [24, Definition 1.2(1)].\nNow fix a, b, c \u2208 A0 . We observed in Proposition 2.4 that E(a\u2217 b) is in M(A)\u03b1 ,\nand the inclusion A0 E(A0 ) \u2282 A0 in Lemma 2.3 implies that E(a\u2217 b) multiplies A0 .\nLemma 2.2 implies that the function s 7\u2192 c\u03b1s (a\u2217 b) is in Cc (G, A) and\nZ\n\u2217\ncE(a b) = c\u03b1s (a\u2217 b) ds.\nSo ha, biR := E(a\u2217 b) has the properties required in [24, Definition 1.2(2)]. Thus \u03b1 is\nproper.\nTo identify A\u03b1 , we note first that\nA\u03b1 = span{E(a\u2217 b) | a, b \u2208 A0 } \u2282 E(A0 ) = Fix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6).\nFor the reverse inclusion, let f ag \u2208 A0 . By the nondegeneracy of \u03c6, we can approximate a \u2248 a\u22171 hka2 , and then by continuity of a 7\u2192 E(f ag) we have E(f ag) \u2248\n\u0003\nE(f a\u22171 hka2 g), and A\u03b1 \u2283 Fix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6).\nIn [25], Rieffel asserted that if the proper action of G on X is free, then \u03b1 is\nsaturated with respect to A0 in the sense of [24, Definition 1.6], and a proof of this\nassertion was provided in [8, Lemma 4.1]. Thus Corollary 1.7 of [24] implies that the\ncompletion Z(A) of A0 in the norm defined by h*, *iR is an (A \u00d7\u03b1,r G)\u2013Fix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6)\nimprimitivity bimodule. The left module action of Cc (G, A) \u2282 A\u00d7\u03b1,r G on A0 \u2282 Z(A)\nis given by\nZ\nf (s)\u03b1s (a)\u2206(s)1/2 ds,\n\nf *a=\n\nG\n\nand the left inner product L ha, bi for a, b \u2208 A0 is the element of Cc (G, A) defined by\nL ha, bi(s)\n\n= a\u03b1s (b\u2217 )\u2206(s)\u22121/2 .\n\nTheorem 3.2. Suppose that G acts freely and properly on a locally compact space X,\nand \u03c3 : (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) \u2192 (B, \u03b2, \u03c8) is a morphism in (C0 (X), \u03b3) \u2193 A(G).

By composing with the functor \u03c6 7\u2192 [\u03c6] from C to Caug described\nin Remark 1.1, we may view both Fix and the reduced-crossed-product functor\nRCP : (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) 7\u2192 A \u00d7\u03b1,r G as taking values in the augmented category Caug of [4].\nTheorem 3.2 then says that diagram (3.1) commutes in Caug , so the assignment\n(A, \u03b1, \u03c6) 7\u2192 Z(A) implements a natural isomorphism between RCP and Fix.\nFor the proof of Theorem 3.2, we need a lemma.\nLemma 3.4. Cc (X)E(A0 ) is dense in Z(A).\nProof. The homomorphism \u03c6 : C0 (X) \u2192 M(A), which is a morphism in the category\nC, induces a morphism\n\u03c6 \u00d7r G : C0 (X) \u00d7\u03b3,r G \u2192 A \u00d7\u03b1,r G\nin C. Since A\u00d7\u03b1,r G acts nondegenerately on the bimodule Z(A), so does C0 (X)\u00d7\u03b3,r G.\nThe action \u03b3 of G on C0 (X) is saturated, which ensures that the inner products\nL hf, gi(s)\n\n= f \u03b3s (\u1e21)\u2206(s)\u22121/2\n\nfor f, g \u2208 Cc (X) \u2282 Z(C0 (X)) span a dense subspace of C0 (X) \u00d7\u03b3,r G. Thus the\nelements\nZ\nZ\nf \u03b3s (\u1e21)\u03b1s (a) ds =\nf \u03b1s (\u1e21a) ds\nL hf, gia =\nG\n\nG\n\nfor f, g \u2208 Cc (X) \u2282 Z(C0 (X)) and a \u2208 A0 span a dense subspace of Z(A). Since every\na \u2208 A0 can be factored as a = ga, and\nZ\nf E(a) = f E(ga) =\nf \u03b1s (ga) ds = L hf, \u1e21ia,\nG\n\nwe deduce that the elements f E(a) span a dense subspace.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.5. If \u03c3 : (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) \u2192 (B, \u03b2, \u03c8) is a morphism in the comma category\n(C0 (X), \u03b3) \u2193 A(G), then \u03c3(A0 )E(B0 ) is dense in Z(B).\nProof. For f, g \u2208 Cc (X), a \u2208 A0 , and b \u2208 B0 we have\n\u03c3(f ag)E(b) = f \u03c3(a)gE(b).\nThis suffices, because Cc (X)E(B0 ) is dense in Z(B) by Lemma 3.4, and both \u03c3(A0 )\nand Cc (X) act nondegenerately on Z(B).\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 3.2. It is easily checked that \u03a6 respects the right module action of\nFix(B, \u03b2, \u03c8). To see that it preserves the inner products, we let a, c \u2208 A0 , b, d \u2208 B0 ,\n\n\f10\n\nKALISZEWSKI, QUIGG, AND RAEBURN\n\nand compute:\nh\u03a6(a \u2297 E(b)), \u03a6(c \u2297 E(d))iR = E E(b\u2217 )\u03c3(a\u2217 c)E(d)\n\n\u0001\n\n= E(b\u2217 )E(\u03c3(a\u2217 c))E(d) (by Lemma 2.1)\n= E(b\u2217 )\u03c3(E(a\u2217 c))E(d)\n= E(b\u2217 )\u03c3(ha, ciR )E(d)\n= hE(b), ha, ciR * E(d)iR\n= ha \u2297 E(b), c \u2297 E(d)iR .\nTo check that \u03a6 preserves the left action, we note that the action of f \u2208 Cc (G, A) \u2282\nA\u00d7\u03b1,r G is given by a norm-convergent integral, which allows us to compute as follows:\n\u03a6(f * (a \u2297 E(b))) = \u03c3(f * a)E(b)\n\u0010Z\n\u0011\n=\u03c3\nf (s)\u03b1s (a)\u2206(s)1/2 ds E(b)\nZ\n= \u03c3(f (s)\u03b1s (a))E(b)\u2206(s)1/2 ds\nZ\n= (\u03c3 \u00d7r G)(f )(s)\u03b2s (\u03c3(a)E(b))\u2206(s)1/2 ds\n(since E(b) \u2208 M(B)\u03b2 )\n= (\u03c3 \u00d7r G)(f ) * \u03a6(a \u2297 E(b)).\nSo \u03a6 is a norm-preserving bimodule homomorphism. Corollary 3.5 says that \u03a6 has\ndense range, and hence \u03a6 is an isomorphism, as claimed.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.6. When G does not act freely, the action \u03b3 on C0 (X) is not saturated,\nand we do not expect actions in the comma category to be saturated either. Rieffel's\ntheory will then give a Morita equivalence between the generalized fixed-point algebra\nFix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6) and an ideal I(A) in A \u00d7\u03b1,r G. It is tempting to conjecture that this\nequivalence is also natural, but it is not even obvious to us that the assignment\n(A, \u03b1, \u03c6) 7\u2192 I(A) is a functor in the necessary sense.\n4. Landstad duality for coactions\nApplying Corollary 2.8 to the action rt : G \u2192 Aut C0 (G) induced by right translation on X = G gives a functor Fix from (C0 (G), rt) \u2193 A(G) to C. As a map on objects,\nthe functor Fix underlies the Landstad duality for coactions in [18, Theorem 3.3], and\nwe will augment the functor Fix to give a categorical version of Landstad duality for\ncoactions, parallel to the categorical Landstad duality for actions described in [9].\nThe Landstad duality of [18] identifies the C \u2217 -algebras which are isomorphic to\ncrossed products by a coaction. The coactions in [18] are the reduced coactions\nstudied in [11], which are homomorphisms \u03b4 from a C \u2217 -algebra B to M(B \u2297 Cr\u2217 (G))\n(see [11, Definition 2.1] for the full details). Theorem 3.7 of [11] implies that the\ncrossed product B \u00d7\u03b4 G is universal for a family of covariant homomorphisms (\u03c0, \u03bc)\nconsisting of nondegenerate homomorphisms \u03c0 : B \u2192 M(C), \u03bc : C0 (G) \u2192 M(C)\n\n\fPROPER ACTIONS AND FIXED-POINT ALGEBRAS\n\n11\n\n(where C is any C \u2217 -algebra) such that\n(4.1)\n\n\u03c0 \u2297 id(\u03b4(b)) = Ad \u03bc \u2297 id(WG )(\u03c0(b) \u2297 1) for b \u2208 B,\n\nwhere we view WG : s 7\u2192 \u03bbs as a multiplier of C0 (G, Cr\u2217 (G)) = C0 (G) \u2297 Cr\u2217 (G); the\nC \u2217 -algebra B \u00d7\u03b4 G is generated by a canonical covariant homomorphism (jB , jG ) in\nM(B \u00d7\u03b4 G). There is a natural dual action \u03b4b : G \u2192 Aut B \u00d7\u03b4 G which is characterized\nby\n\u03b4bt (jB (b)jG (f )) = jB (b)jG (rtt (f )).\nWe can now restate Theorem 3.3 of [18] as follows:\n\nTheorem 4.1 ([18]). Let (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) be an object in (C0 (G), rt) \u2193 A(G). Then\n\u03b4(c) := Ad \u03c6 \u2297 id(WG )(c \u2297 1)\ndefines a reduced coaction \u03b4 = \u03b4 A of G on Fix A := Fix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6), and there is an\nisomorphism \u03b8 = \u03b8A of (Fix A) \u00d7\u03b4 G onto A such that \u03b8 \u25e6 \u03b1 = \u03b4b and\n\u0001\n(4.2)\n\u03b8 jFix A (c)jG (f ) = c\u03c6(f ) for c \u2208 Fix A, f \u2208 C0 (G).\n\nThe reduced coactions (B, \u03b4) of G are the objects in a category C r (G), whose\nmorphisms \u03c0 : (B, \u03b4) \u2192 (C, \u01eb) are the nondegenerate homomorphisms \u03c0 : B \u2192 M(C)\nsuch that (\u03c0 \u2297 id) \u25e6 \u03b4 = \u01eb \u25e6 \u03c0. If \u03c3 : (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) \u2192 (B, \u03b2, \u03c8) is a morphism in the\ncomma category (C0 (G), rt) \u2193 A(G), then Proposition 2.6 implies that \u03c3 restricts to\na morphism \u03c3| : Fix(A, \u03b1, \u03c6) \u2192 Fix(B, \u03b2, \u03c8) in C. The restriction \u03c3| satisfies\n\u03c3| \u2297 id(\u03c6 \u2297 id(WG )) = (\u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c6) \u2297 id(WG ) = \u03c8 \u2297 id(WG ).\nThus (\u03c3| \u2297 id) \u25e6 \u03b4 A = \u03b4 B \u25e6 \u03c3|, so \u03c3| is a morphism in the category C r (G). In this way,\nwe extend Fix to a functor Fixr from (C0 (G), rt) \u2193 A(G) to C r (G).\nTheorem 4.2. The functor Fixr : (C0 (G), rt) \u2193 A(G) \u2192 C r (G) is a category equivalence, with quasi-inverse given by the crossed-product functor CPr which assigns\nb jG )\n(B, \u03b4) 7\u2192 (B \u00d7\u03b4 G, \u03b4,\n\nand \u03c0 7\u2192 \u03c0 \u00d7 G.\n\nProof. By abstract nonsense, as in [9, \u00a71], it suffices to check that CPr \u25e6 Fixr \u223c\n= id and\nr\nCP is full and faithful. For the first statement, we must show that the isomorphism\n\u03b8A of Theorem 4.1 is natural in (A, \u03b1, \u03c6). To see this, suppose \u03c3 : (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) \u2192 (B, \u03b2, \u03c8)\nis a morphism. Then CPr \u25e6 Fixr (\u03c3) is the homomorphism \u03c3| \u00d7 G, and it follows easily\nfrom (4.2) that \u03c3 \u25e6 \u03b8A and \u03b8B \u25e6 (\u03c3| \u00d7 G) agree on elements of the form jFix A (c)jG (f ),\nand hence are equal.\nNext we must show that for every pair of objects (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) and (B, \u03b2, \u03c8),\nFixr : Mor((A, \u03b1, \u03c6), (B, \u03b2, \u03c8)) \u2192 Mor(Fixr (A, \u03b1, \u03c6), Fixr (B, \u03b2, \u03c8))\nis a bijection. To establish injectivity, suppose \u03c3, \u03c4 : (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) \u2192 (B, \u03b2, \u03c8) have\n\u03c3| = \u03c4 |. The last assertion in Theorem 4.1 implies that the elements E(a)\u03c6(f ) span\na dense subspace of A, and\n\u03c3(E(a)\u03c6(f )) = \u03c3|(E(a))\u03c8(f ) = \u03c4 |(E(a))\u03c8(f ) = \u03c4 (E(a)\u03c6(f )),\n\n\f12\n\nKALISZEWSKI, QUIGG, AND RAEBURN\n\nso \u03c3 = \u03c4 . For surjectivity, suppose that \u03c0 is a morphism from Fixr (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) =\n(Fix A, \u03b4) to Fixr (B, \u03b2, \u03c8) = (Fix B, \u01eb). Then the morphism \u03c0 \u00d7 G : (Fix A) \u00d7\u03b4 G \u2192\n(Fix B) \u00d7\u01eb G satisfies\n\u03c0 \u00d7 G(jFix A (c)jG (f )) = jFix B (\u03c0(c))jG (f ),\nand pulling this over under the isomorphisms \u03b8 of Theorem 4.1 gives a morphism\n\u03c3 : (A, \u03b1, \u03c6) \u2192 (B, \u03b2, \u03c8) such that\n(4.3)\n\n\u03c3(c\u03c6(f )) = \u03c0(c)\u03c8(f ) for c \u2208 Fix A and f \u2208 C0 (G).\n\nBut \u03c3(c\u03c6(f )) = \u03c3|(c)\u03c8(f ), so (4.3) implies that \u03c3|(c) = \u03c0(c), and we have \u03c3| = \u03c0. \u0003\nCoaction cognoscenti usually work with full coactions rather than reduced ones,\nand might prefer to know the following analogue of Theorem 4.2 for the classes of\nnormal and maximal coactions. Our notation is explained in the Appendix.\nCorollary 4.3. The crossed-product functors\nCPn : C n (G) \u2192 (C0 (G), rt) \u2193 A(G) and\nCPm : C m (G) \u2192 (C0 (G), rt) \u2193 A(G)\nare equivalences.\nProof. Since CPr is a quasi-inverse for Fixr , it is an equivalence. So it follows from\nTheorem A.1 that CPn = CPr \u25e6 Red is an equivalence. Now Corollary A.3 implies\nthat CPm = CPn \u25e6 Nor is also an equivalence.\n\u0003\n5. Iterated Landstad duality\nLandstad duality for actions, as formulated in [9, Theorem 4.1], gives an equivalence\nbetween A(G) and a comma category of coactions. When we apply the equivalence\nof Theorem 4.2 to this comma category, we obtain an equivalence between A(G) and\nan iterated comma category in A(G). In this section, we identify this iterated comma\ncategory and obtain interesting new information about Landstad duality for actions\n(see Remark 5.4).\nWe begin with two abstract lemmas about comma categories which will help us\nidentify the iterated comma category. The first is similar to [9, Corollary 2.2].\nLemma 5.1. Let F : C \u2192 D be a category equivalence, and let a \u2208 Obj C. Then\nthe map Fe : a \u2193 C \u2192 F a \u2193 D, defined on objects by Fe(x, f ) = (F x, F f ) and on\nmorphisms by Feh = F h, is an equivalence.\n\nProof. It is routine to check that Fe is a functor. As usual, we verify that Fe is full,\nfaithful, and essentially surjective. For the essential surjectivity, let (y, g) \u2208 Obj F a \u2193\nD. Since F is an equivalence, there exists x \u2208 Obj C and an isomorphism \u03b8 : y \u2192 F x\nin D, and then for the same reason there exists f \u2208 C(a, x) such that \u03b8 \u25e6 g = F f .\nThen\n\u223c\n=\n\u03b8 : (y, g) \u2212\u2192 (F x, F f ) = Fe(x, f ) in F a \u2193 D.\nTo see that Fe is full and faithful, let k : Fe(x, f ) \u2192 Fe(y, g) in F a \u2193 D. We must\nshow that there is a unique h : (x, f ) \u2192 (y, g) in a \u2193 C such that Feh = k. We have\n\n\fPROPER ACTIONS AND FIXED-POINT ALGEBRAS\n\n13\n\nk : F x \u2192 F y in D, so because F is an equivalence there is a unique h : x \u2192 y in C\nsuch that F h = k. Since k \u25e6 F f = F g in D, we have h \u25e6 f = g in C, again because F\nis an equivalence. Thus h : (x, f ) \u2192 (y, g) in a \u2193 C and Feh = k. Moreover, h is the\nunique such morphism in a \u2193 C, because of its uniqueness in C.\n\u0003\nLemma 5.2. Let D be a category, let b \u2208 Obj D, and let (y, g) \u2208 Obj(b \u2193 D). Then\nthe iterated comma category (y, g) \u2193 (b \u2193 D) is isomorphic to y \u2193 D.\nProof. Let E = (y, g) \u2193 (b \u2193 D). An object ((z, h), u) of E comprises an object z of\nD, a morphism h : b \u2192 z in D, and a morphism u : y \u2192 z in D such that u \u25e6 g = h.\nA morphism \u03c6 : ((z, h), u) \u2192 ((w, k), v) in E is a morphism \u03c6 : z \u2192 w in D such that\n\u03c6 \u25e6 h = k and \u03c6 \u25e6 u = v, and since h = u \u25e6 g and k = v \u25e6 g, the equation \u03c6 \u25e6 h = k is\nautomatic given \u03c6 \u25e6 u = v. Thus the formulas\nG((z, h), u) = (z, u) and G(\u03c6) = \u03c6\ngive well-defined maps on objects and morphisms from E to y \u2193 D, and it is routine\nto check that G is then a functor. The map defined on objects and morphisms of\ny \u2193 D by\n(z, u) 7\u2192 ((z, u \u25e6 g), u) and \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6\nis an inverse for G, and thus G is the desired isomorphism.\n\u0003\nFor a locally compact group G, the canonical map irG : G \u2192 UM(A \u00d7\u03b1,r G) has an\n\u2217\nintegrated form if,r\nG : C (G) \u2192 M(A \u00d7\u03b1,r G), which factors through a homomorphism\nr\nirG : Cr\u2217 (G) \u2192 M(A \u00d7\u03b1,r G) (so that if,r\nG = iG \u25e6 \u03bb).\nProposition 5.3.

Theorem 4.1 of [9] says that the assignments\n\n(A, \u03b1) 7\u2192 (A \u00d7\u03b1,r G, \u03b1\nb, if,r\nG ) and \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6 \u00d7r G\n\ngive an equivalence between A(G) and (C \u2217 (G), \u03b4G ) \u2193 C n (G). There is a subtlety here:\n(C \u2217 (G), \u03b4G ) need not be a normal coaction, and the arrows in the comma category\nn\nare morphisms in C(G). However, the normalization of \u03b4G is the full coaction \u03b4G\nof G\n\u2217\n\u2217\non Cr (G) [4, Proposition A.61], and every morphism \u03c6 : (C (G), \u03b4G ) \u2192 (B, \u03b4) with \u03b4\nn\nnormal has the form \u03c6n \u25e6 \u03bb for a unique morphism \u03c6n : (Cr\u2217 (G), \u03b4G\n) \u2192 (B, \u03b4). (The\nn\nexistence of \u03c6 is proved in the Appendix as part of the assertion that normalization\nis a functor.) Thus the map (B, \u03b4, \u03c8) 7\u2192 (B, \u03b4, \u03c8 \u25e6 \u03bb) is an isomorphism\nn\n(Cr\u2217 (G), \u03b4G\n) \u2193 C n (G) \u2192 (C \u2217 (G), \u03b4G ) \u2193 C n (G)\n\nof comma categories.

This result contains new information about Landstad duality. It implies that a system (C, \u03b2) in A(G) is isomorphic to a double-dual action if and only\nr\nif there exists a morphism \u03c6 : (Cr\u2217 (G) \u00d7\u03b4Gr G, \u03b4c\nG ) \u2192 (C, \u03b2). The underlying homomorphism comes from a covariant homomorphism (\u03c0, \u03bc) := (\u03c6 \u25e6 jCr\u2217 (G) , \u03c6 \u25e6 jG ) of\nr\n(Cr\u2217 (G), \u03b4G\n) in M(C); \u03c0 is the integrated form of a unitary U : G \u2192 UM(C), and the\ncovariance of (\u03c0, \u03bc) is then equivalent to the covariance of (\u03bc, U) : (C0 (G), lt) \u2192 M(C)\n(see, for example, Example 2.9(1) of [21]). So Proposition 5.3 implies that (C, \u03b2) is\nisomorphic to a double-dual action if and only if there is a covariant homomorphism\n(\u03bc, U) of (C0 (G), lt) in M(C) such that \u03bc\u25e6rts = \u03b2s \u25e6\u03bc and \u03b2s (Ut ) = Ut for all s, t \u2208 G.\nIt seems to us that it might take some work to deduce this assertion directly from\nthe non-categorical versions of Landstad duality in [10] and [18].\nRemark 5.5. There are several other versions of iterated Landstad duality. First,\nan argument parallel to that of Proposition 5.3 gives a dual equivalence\n\u0001\nbb B\nand \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6 \u00d7 G \u00d7r G\n(B, \u03b4) 7\u2192 B \u00d7\u03b4 G \u00d7\u03b4,r\nb G, \u03b4, jG \u00d7 G\n\nb \u2193 C r (G) (here we used the equality C0 (G)\u00d7rt G =\nbetween C r (G) and (C0 (G)\u00d7rt G, rt)\nC0 (G) \u00d7rt,r G). Other variants can then be derived using the equivalence C m (G) \u223c\nC n (G) and the isomorphism C n (G) \u223c\n= C r (G).\n6. Naturality of Mansfield imprimitivity\nSuppose that H is a closed subgroup of a locally compact group G. In this section,\nwe apply Theorem 3.2, with (X, G) = (G, H), to elements of the comma category\n(C0 (G), rt|) \u2193 A(H) of the form (B \u00d7\u03b4 G, \u03b4\u0302|, jG ), where \u03b4 is a reduced coaction.\nTheorem 3.1 of [7] says that the restriction \u03b4\u0302| of the dual action to H is proper with\nrespect to Mansfield's subalgebra D of B \u00d7\u03b4 G. Lemma 3.3 of [7] says that D \u2282 m,\nand the right inner product used in [7] is defined using our averaging process E as\nhx, yi = E(x\u2217 y), so that the generalized fixed-point algebra (B \u00d7\u03b4 G)\u03b4\u0302| obtained in\n[7] is the closed span in M(B \u00d7\u03b4 G) of the set {E(x\u2217 y) : x, y \u2208 D}. The proof of\nTheorem 3.1 in [7, pages 1157\u201358] shows that this generalized fixed-point algebra is\nprecisely the subalgebra B \u00d7\u03b4,r (G/H) of M(B \u00d7\u03b4 G).\n\n\fPROPER ACTIONS AND FIXED-POINT ALGEBRAS\n\n15\n\nWe know from [7, Lemma 3.2] that D = Cc (G)DCc (G), and hence D is a subalgebra\nof our A0 := Cc (G)(B \u00d7\u03b4 G)Cc (G).

On the\nother hand, D is dense in B \u00d7\u03b4 G by [13, Theorem 12], and it follows from the\nnorm continuity of the map a 7\u2192 E(f ag) that every E(f ag) for f ag \u2208 A0 belongs to\n(B \u00d7\u03b4 G)\u03b4\u0302| .

Since H acts freely on G, the imprimitivity algebras of\nboth D and Z(B \u00d7\u03b4 G) are (B \u00d7\u03b4 G) \u00d7\u03b4,r\nb H. Thus the Rieffel correspondence implies\nthat D = Z(B \u00d7\u03b4 G), and the following theorem on the naturality of the Morita\nequivalence in [7] follows from Remark 3.3.\nTheorem 6.2. The bimodules Z(B \u00d7\u03b4 G) implement a natural isomorphism between\nthe functors (B, \u03b4) 7\u2192 B \u00d7\u03b4,r (G/H) and (B, \u03b4) 7\u2192 (B \u00d7\u03b4 G) \u00d7\u03b4\u0302,r H from C r (G) to Caug .\nProof. We just need to observe that the second functor factors as\nCPr\n\nRCP\n\nC r (G) \u2212\u2212\u2192 (C0 (G), rt) \u2193 A(G) \u2192 (C0 (G), rt|) \u2193 A(H) \u2212\u2212\u2192 Caug ,\nwhere the first two functors are the same as the first two in the factorization (6.3) of\n(B, \u03b4) 7\u2192 B \u00d7\u03b4,r (G/H), and the third is the functor RCP in Remark 3.3, which by\nTheorem 3.2 is naturally isomorphic to Fix.\n\u0003\nAppendix A. Reduction and normalization of coactions\nWe consider the category C r (G) in which the objects (B, \u03b4) are (nondegenerate)\nreduced coactions \u03b4 : B \u2192 M(B \u2297 Cr\u2217 (G)), and the category C(G) of (nondegenerate)\n\n\f16\n\nKALISZEWSKI, QUIGG, AND RAEBURN\n\nfull coactions \u03b4 : B \u2192 M(B \u2297 C \u2217 (G)); in both categories, the morphisms \u03c6 : (B, \u03b4) \u2192\n(C, \u01eb) are the nondegenerate homomorphisms \u03c6 : B \u2192 M(C) such that\n(\u03c6 \u2297 id) \u25e6 \u03b4 = \u01eb \u25e6 \u03c6,\n\n(A.1)\nr\n\nthough in C (G), (A.1) holds in M(C\u2297Cr\u2217 (G)), and in C(G), it holds in M(C\u2297C \u2217 (G)).\nFor systems in C(G), covariance is defined using the function wG : s 7\u2192 iG (s) from\nG to UM(C \u2217 (G)), whereas for systems in C r (G), it is defined using WG : s 7\u2192 \u03bbs\n(see (4.1)). Each system (B, \u03b4) has a crossed product (B \u00d7\u03b4 G, jB , jG ) carrying a dual\naction \u03b4b of G, and there are functors CP on C(G) and CPr on C r (G) which take a\nb jG ) of the comma category (C0 (G), rt) \u2193 A(G).\nsystem (B, \u03b4) to the element (B\u00d7\u03b4 G, \u03b4,\nWe will be interested in the full subcategory C n (G) of C(G) consisting of the normal\ncoactions, that is, those (B, \u03b4) in C(G) for which jB : B \u2192 M(B \u00d7\u03b4 G) is an injection.\nFor every object (B, \u03b4) in C n (G), the map \u03b4 r := (id \u2297 \u03bb) \u25e6 \u03b4 is a reduced coaction\nof G on the same C \u2217 -algebra B, called the reduction of \u03b4 (see [19, Proposition 3.3]).\nIf \u03c6 : (B, \u03b4) \u2192 (C, \u01eb) is a morphism in C n (G), then applying id \u2297 \u03bb to both sides of\n(A.1) shows that the underlying homomorphism \u03c6 : B \u2192 M(C) also gives a morphism\n\u03c6 : (B, \u03b4 r ) \u2192 (C, \u01ebr ) in C r (G). Indeed, the assignments\n(B, \u03b4) 7\u2192 (B, \u03b4 r ) and \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6\nform a functor Red : C n (G) \u2192 C r (G).\nThe following theorem sums up the properties of the reducing process.\nTheorem A.1. For every locally compact group G, the functor Red is an isomorphism between C n (G) and C r (G). The crossed product functors CPn := CP|C n (G) and\nCPr are related by CPn = CPr \u25e6 Red.\nThere are choices implicit in the last assertion of the above theorem: a crossed\nproduct of a system (B, \u03b4) is by definition a triple (C, jB , jG ) which is universal for\ncovariant homomorphisms, and to define the functors CPn and CPr we either need\nto nominate a particular construction which works for all (B, \u03b4) (as in [4, \u00a73.1.2]), or\nchoose a triple for each (B, \u03b4) using the axiom of choice (as advocated in [9]). The\nequality CPn = CPr \u25e6 Red means that, when we make a construction or choice for\none of CPn or CPr , that same construction or choice will work for the other.\nProof. To see that Red is an isomorphism, it suffices to check that Red is bijective on\nobjects, faithful, and full. If (B, \u03b4) is a reduced coaction, then Theorem 4.7 of [19]\nimplies that there is a unique normal coaction \u03b4 f of G on B such that \u03b4 = (\u03b4 f )r , so\nRed is bijective on objects. Since the underlying nondegenerate homomorphisms of \u03c6\nand Red(\u03c6) are the same, Red is trivially faithful. Checking fullness, though, seems\nto require some work: we must show that if (B, \u03b4), (C, \u01eb) are objects in C n (G) and\n\u03c6 : (B, \u03b4 r ) \u2192 (C, \u01ebr ) is a morphism in C r (G), then (\u03c6\u2297id)\u25e6\u03b4 = \u01eb\u25e6\u03c6 as homomorphisms\ninto M(B \u2297 C \u2217 (G)), so that the underlying nondegenerate homomorphism \u03c6 : B \u2192\nM(C) is also a morphism in C n (G).\nTheorem 4.7 of [19] says there is exactly one normal coaction with reduction \u03b4 r , so\nwe can identify \u03b4 with the coaction (\u03b4 r )f constructed in the proof of [19, Theorem 4.7].\nThere it is proved that Ad jG \u2297id(wG ) gives a full coaction of G on the crossed product\nB \u00d7\u03b4r G, and that this coaction restricts to a full coaction on the subalgebra jB (B) of\n\n\fPROPER ACTIONS AND FIXED-POINT ALGEBRAS\n\n17\n\nM(B \u00d7\u03b4r G); (\u03b4 r )f is the coaction on B pulled back from the coaction Ad jG \u2297 id(wG )\nvia the isomorphism jB . In other words, \u03b4 = (\u03b4 r )f is characterized by\n(A.2)\n\njB \u2297 id(\u03b4(b)) = Ad jG \u2297 id(wG )(jB (b) \u2297 1).\n\nTo help keep things straight, we denote the canonical map of C0 (G) into M(B \u00d7\u03b4r G)\nby jGB .\nSince \u03c6 : (B, \u03b4 r ) \u2192 (C, \u01ebr ) is a morphism in C r (G), there is a nondegenerate\nhomomorphism \u03c6 \u00d7 G : B \u00d7\u03b4r G \u2192 M(C \u00d7\u01ebr G) such that\n\u03c6 \u00d7 G(jB (b)jGB (f )) = jC (\u03c6(b))jGC (f ).\nThis implies in particular that (\u03c6 \u00d7 G) \u25e6 jGB = jGC , so\n(A.3)\n\n(\u03c6 \u00d7 G) \u2297 id(jGB \u2297 id(wG )) = jGC \u2297 id(wG ).\n\nWe now take b \u2208 B and compute, using (\u03c6 \u00d7 G) \u25e6 jB = jC \u25e6 \u03c6, (A.2), (A.3) and then\n(A.2) again:\n\u0001\njC \u2297 id(\u03c6 \u2297 id(\u03b4(b))) = (\u03c6 \u00d7 G) \u2297 id jB \u2297 id(\u03b4(b))\n\u0001\n= (\u03c6 \u00d7 G) \u2297 id Ad jGB \u2297 id(wG )(jB (b) \u2297 1)\n= Ad jGC \u2297 id(wG )(jC (\u03c6(b)) \u2297 1)\n= jC \u2297 id(\u01eb(\u03c6(b))),\nwhich, since jC is injective, implies that \u03c6 is a morphism in C n (G). Thus Red is an\nisomorphism.\nTo finish, we deduce from [19, Proposition 3.8] (or [21, Theorem 4.1]) that a triple\n(C, \u03c0, \u03bc) is a crossed product of the reduction (B, \u03b4 r ) if and only if it is a crossed\nproduct of (B, \u03b4), and hence CPn = CPr \u25e6 Red.\n\u0003\nNext we consider the full subcategory C m (G) of C(G) consisting of the maximal\ncoactions for which full crossed-product duality holds (see [2]). It was shown in [9]\nthat normalization implements an equivalence between C m (G) and C n (G), and we\nwant to know that this equivalence is compatible with crossed products.\nIf (B, \u03b4) is a full coaction, the normalization introduced in [19] is a normal coaction\nn\n\u03b4 on a quotient B n of B; if qB : B \u2192 B n is the quotient map, then \u03b4 n is characterized\nby \u03b4 n \u25e6 qB = (qB \u2297 id) \u25e6 \u03b4. If \u03c6 : (B, \u03b4) \u2192 (C, \u01eb) is a morphism in C(G), then there\nis a unique morphism \u03c6n : (B n , \u03b4 n ) \u2192 (C n , \u01ebn ) in C(G) such that \u03c6n \u25e6 qB = qC \u25e6 \u03c6.\n(Since (C n , \u01ebn ) is normal, it has a covariant representation (\u03c0, \u03bc) with \u03c0 faithful;\nnow (\u03c0 \u25e6 qC \u25e6 \u03c6, \u03bc) is a covariant representation of (B, \u03b4), and [19, Proposition 2.6]\nimplies that \u03c0 \u25e6 qC \u25e6 \u03c6 and qC \u25e6 \u03c6 factor through qB .) Thus normalization is a functor\nNor : C(G) \u2192 C n (G).\nProposition A.2. The composition CPn \u25e6 Nor : C(G) \u2192 (C0 (G), rt) \u2193 A(G) is\nnaturally isomorphic to CP.\nProof. If (B, \u03b4) is a full coaction, then the induced map qB \u00d7 G is an isomorphism of\nB \u00d7\u03b4 G onto B n \u00d7\u03b4n G (see [19, Proposition 2.6]); we claim that these isomorphisms are\nnatural. Suppose \u03c6 : (B, \u03b4) \u2192 (C, \u01eb) is a morphism in C(G). Then \u03c6n : B n \u2192 M(C n )\n\n\f18\n\nKALISZEWSKI, QUIGG, AND RAEBURN\n\nis also a nondegenerate homomorphism, and satisfies \u03c6n \u25e6 qB = qC \u25e6 \u03c6. But now the\nfunctoriality of CP : C(G) \u2192 (C0 (G), rt) \u2193 A(G) implies that\n(\u03c6n \u00d7 G) \u25e6 (qB \u00d7 G) = (qC \u00d7 G) \u25e6 (\u03c6 \u00d7 G),\nand hence we have the naturality of the isomorphisms qB \u00d7 G.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary A.3. Normalization implements an equivalence between C m (G) and C n (G),\nand CPn \u25e6 Nor is naturally isomorphic to CPm := CP|C m (G) .\nProof. It is proved in [9, Theorem 3.3] that Nor is an equivalence on the subcategory\nC m (G), and the rest follows from Proposition A.2.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] B.
