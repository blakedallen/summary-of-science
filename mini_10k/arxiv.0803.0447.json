We introduce a duality construction for toric Landau-Ginzburg\nmodels, applicable to complete intersections in toric varieties via the sigma\nmodel / Landau-Ginzburg model correspondence. This construction is shown\nto reconstruct those of Batyrev-Borisov, Berglund-H\u00fcbsch, Givental, and HoriVafa. It can be done in more general situations, and provides partial resolutions\nwhen the above constructions give a singular mirror. An extended example is\ngiven: the Landau-Ginzburg models dual to elliptic curves in (P1 )2 .\n\nintroduction\nMotivated by the mirror involution on N = 2 superconformal theories and the\nfact that one can define from a Calabi-Yau such a theory, string theorists believe\nthat Calabi-Yaus exist in \"mirror pairs\". In other words, to any Calabi-Yau, Z,\nthere exists another, \u017d, such that the superconformal theories they define are mirror\nto each other.\nMathematically, such a pair would have mirror symmetric Hodge diamonds,\n(1)\n\nhp,q (Z) = hn\u2212p,q (\u017d),\n\nit would be possible to compute the Gromov-Witten invariants of Z from the periods of \u017d, and, following the homological mirror symmetry conjecture of Kontsevich\n[Kon95a], the derived category of coherent sheaves on Z, Db (coh Z), would be\nequivalent to the derived Fukaya category of \u017d, DF uk(\u017d). Broadly speaking, mirror symmetry transforms invariants of the symplectic topology of Z into invariants\nof the complex structure of \u017d, and vice versa.\nFor general K\u00e4hler manifolds Z it is possible to define Hodge numbers and\nDb (coh Z), and often (e.g. if Z is Fano) Gromov-Witten invariants and DF uk(Z)\nmake sense. This leads naturally to the question of mirror pairs for general K\u00e4hler\nmanifolds, rather than just Calabi-Yaus. One immediately obvious hurdle is the\nexistence of a K\u00e4hler manifold, \u017d, satisfying the mirror symmetric Hodge diamond\nrelation above is only possible in the Calabi-Yau case since\n(2)\n\nhn,0 (Z) = h0,0 (\u017d) = 1.\n\nA promising solution to problems such as this is the use of Landau-Ginzburg\nmodels as mirrors. A Landau-Ginzburg model is a superconformal theory defined\nby a K\u00e4hler manifold X\u030c equipped with a holomorphic function W\u030c : X\u030c \u2192 C. The\nfunction W\u030c is referred to as the superpotential. The Hodge numbers are then\nreplaced by dimensions of graded components of a certain \"chiral\" ring associated\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

There also exists a version of the derived category of\ncoherent sheaves for Landau-Ginzburg models, DB(X\u030c, W\u030c ), introduced by Orlov\n[Orl04] (generalizing the category of matrix factorizations), and a version of the\nderived Fukaya category, DF S(X\u030c, W\u030c ), due to Seidel [Sei01].\nThere are four general predictive methods for computing the mirror of a complete\nintersection in a toric variety. The first to appear in the literature is that of Berglund\nand H\u00fcbsch [BH92]. Their construction produces a mirror candidate to a CalabiYau hypersurface in weighted projective space. Their mirror is also a Calabi-Yau\nhypersuface in (a different) weighted projective space.\nShortly after this, Batyrev [Bat94] gave a construction for Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in Gorenstein toric Fano varieties. This was subsequently generalized\nby Borisov [Bor93] to Calabi-Yau complete intersections that arise from \"nefpartitions\" of the anti-canonical divisor. Since a weighted projective space is never\nGorenstein unless it is projective space itself, Berglund-H\u00fcbsch and Batyrev-Borisov\naddress distinct situations.\nThe combined efforts of Batyrev [Bat], Batyrev-Borisov [BB], and Kontsevich\n[Kon95b] ultimately led to the proof that n-dimensional Batyrev-Borsiov pairs, Z\nand \u017d, have mirror symmetric (stringy) Hodge diamonds. Thus giving one of the\nfirst general and rigorous results in mirror symmetry.\nThe same year, Givental published his \"mirror theorem\" [Giv98b] that made\nrigorous and generalized the approach to computing Gromov-Witten invariants\npioneered by physicists in [CdlOGP91]. Given a Fano, complete intersection Z in\na smooth projective toric variety, Givental constructs a Landau-Ginzburg model\nmirror candidate (X\u030c, W\u030c ). He then shows that structure constants of the quantum\ncohomology of Z can be found by considering certain integrals over cycles in X\u030c\nrelated to the Morse theory of W\u030c . It is worth mentioning that the recipe given by\nGivental for the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model can be done for arbitrary complete\nintersections in toric varieties, even though he only considers the case of Fano\nmanifolds.\nThe most recent algorithm to compute a mirror candidate is given by Hori and\nVafa [HV00]. Using physical arguments, from a complete intersection in a smooth\ntoric variety they obtain a mirror Landau-Ginzburg model.\nThis paper puts forth a new method for computing mirror candidates for complete intersections in toric varieties. Given an n-dimensional toric variety X, an\nelement \u03c9 \u2208 the Chow group An\u22121 (X)C/Z (coefficients in C/Z), and a morphism\nW : X \u2192 C, we produce a n-dimensional toric variety X 0 , a Chow group element\n\u03c9 0 \u2208 An\u22121 (X 0 )C/Z , and a morphism W 0 : X 0 \u2192 C (strictly speaking the most natural objects to consider are toric Deligne-Mumford stacks, but we will not need this\nand the generalization is obvious). We call the new Landau-Ginzburg model dual\nto the original.\nUsing an idea from physics called the sigma model / Landau-Ginzburg model\ncorrespondence, this process can be applied to generate a mirror candidate for\na complete intersection in a toric variety. This correspondence goes as follows.\nAssume Z is the zero locus of a global section w \u2208 \u0393(Y, V) of some vector bundle\nV over a K\u00e4hler manifold Y . The identification Hom(V \u2228 , OY ) \u223c\n= \u0393(Y, V) allows\none to use w to define a morphism W : X \u2192 C on the total space X = tot(V \u2228 ).\nPhysically, the superconformal theories defined by Z and (X, W ) are the same\n[GS08]. Based on this, one would expect that the Hodge numbers of Z give the\n\n\fDUALITY FOR TORIC LANDAU-GINZBURG MODELS\n\n3\n\ngraded component dimensions of the chiral ring of (X, W ), etc. Landau-Ginzburg\nmodel mirror candidates are then formed by the composition:\n(3)\n\n\u03a3/LG\n\ndual\n\nZ 7\u2212\u2192 (X, W ) 7\u2212\u2192 (X 0 , W 0 ).\n\nIf (X 0 , W 0 ) has the form of a vector bundle paired with a section of its dual, we can\nLG/\u03a3\n\nrun the correspondence backwards, (X 0 , W 0 ) 7\u2212\u2192 Z 0 , to obtain a K\u00e4hler manifold\nmirror candidate.\nAfter initial definitions and describing the construction of the dual LandauGinzburg model, we compare the mirror candidate obtained using four methods\nabove with the candidate given by the dual. Ultimately, all methods are shown to\nbe special cases of the duality defined here.\nThe Givental and Hori-Vafa mirrors are considered together. By a simple computation, we show they both produce the same mirror. The starting point for their\nconstruction is a split vector bundle V over toric variety Y . The complete intersection is given by a global section of V. Note that in their formulation, the complex\nstructure of Z is ignored. Concretely, this means that Z is the zero locus of some\nglobal section w \u2208 \u0393(Y, V), but the choice of w is not important. This is justified by\nthe fact that whenever integral, smooth subvarieties Z1 and Z2 are given by global\nsections w1 and w2 respectively, they are symplectomorphic. With this in mind,\nwe prove the following theorem.\nTheorem. For a specific choice wGHV \u2208 \u0393(Y, V), the mirror Landau-Ginzburg\nmodel of Givental-Hori-Vafa is the dual Landau-Ginzburg model, (X 0 , W 0 ), to (X =\nTot(V \u2228 ), WGHV ). Where WGHV is defined by wGHV .\nIt is nice to note that the dual to (X 0 , W 0 ) is (X, W \u2212 ), where X is the original\nspace and W \u2212 is closely related to the original superpotential W . This gives a\nnice resolution to the apparent lack of symmetry in the generalization of mirror\nsymmetry to non-Calabi-Yaus bemoaned by Givental in [Wit93]. This is explained\nin remark 6.11.\nThe methods of Berglund-H\u00fcbsch, and Batyrev-Borisov produce mirror families.\nThis is to say that starting from a family of Calabi-Yaus (Zt )t they give a new\nfamily (\u017ds )s without specifying which \u017ds is mirror to a given Zt . This suffices for\nthe comparison of Hodge numbers since these are constant in families.\nThe Berglund and H\u00fcbsch construction is easily treated and a simple calculation\ngives the following theorem.\nTheorem. Let (X, W ) be obtained from the sigma model / Landau-Ginzburg model\ncorrespondence applied to a Calabi-Yau hypersurface Z in weighted projective space.\nThen the dual Landau-Ginzburg model equals the Landau-Ginzburg model corresponding to a member \u017d of the Berglund-H\u00fcbsch mirror family.\nThe last method we analyze is that of Batyrev and Borisov. The starting point\nfor their construction is a split bundle obtained from a nef-partition over a Gorenstein toric Fano variety. After some technical results concerning rational convex\npolyhedral subsets, we arrive at the following theorem.\nTheorem. Let (X, W ) be obtained from the sigma model / Landau-Ginzburg model\ncorrespondence applied to a certain Calabi-Yau ZBB given by a global section of\na split bundle defined by a nef-partition over a toric Fano variety. Then the dual\n\n\f4\n\nPATRICK CLARKE\n\nLandau-Ginzburg model equals the Landau-Ginzburg model corresponding to a member of the Batyrev-Borisov mirror family.\nOne nice aspect about the dual Landau-Ginzburg model is that varying the original superpotential, W , causes the symplectic form \u03c9 0 \u2208 An\u22121 (X 0 )C/Z to vary. When\nX is obtained via the sigma model / Landau-Ginzburg correspondence, varying the\nsuperpotential is the same as varying the complex structure of Z. This identification\nof complex moduli with symplectic moduli is expected between mirror pairs.\nThis can be used to avoid potential difficulties that arise when the mirror candidate is singular. For instance, every element of the Batryev-Borisov mirror family\nmay be singular since the ambient toric variety may be singular. However, varying\nZ away from ZBB leads to a partial resolution of the mirror, thus taking some of\nthe arbitrariness out of the choice of resolution.\nThere is a small example in section 6, and we conclude the paper in with an\nextended example that makes up section 10. Here, the case of elliptic curves in\n(P1 )2 is treated from the point of view of Givental and Batyrev-Borisov, and it is\nshown how our point of view allows for symplectic a resolution of these singular\nmirrors.\nAcknowledgements.

Definitions\nRational convex polyhedral sets. The theory of quasi-projective toric varieties\nis essentially the same as the theory of rational convex polyhedral sets. We will\nuse this fact extensively throughout the paper. Here we review the main points we\nneed.\nGiven a finite rank free abelian group M , we write MG for the tensor product\nM \u2297Z G with an abelian group G. Denote the dual, HomZ (M, Z), by N .\nA rational convex polyhedral set P \u2286 MR is the set of solutions to a set of linear\ninequalities:\n(4)\n\n{\u03be \u2208 MR | \u03bdj (\u03be) + \u03b1j \u2265 0, j = 1, * * * , r},\n\nwhere \u03bdj \u2208 {\u03bd \u2297 1 : MR \u2192 R | \u03bd \u2208 N } and \u03b1j \u2208 R.\nThe inequalities can be packaged together into a homomorphism A = (\u03bd1 , * * * , \u03bdr ) : M \u2192\nZr , and an element \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , * * * , \u03b1r ) \u2208 Rr = (Zr )R . With these we have P = {\u03be \u2208\nMR | A(\u03be) + \u03b1 \u2265 0}.\nA face of P is either the intersection of P with the boundary of an affine halfspace containing P , or P itself. The dimension of a face is the dimension of the\nreal vector space given by the span of the elements of the face. A facet of P is a\nface whose dimension is one less that the dimension of P .\nIf C is an arbitrary subset of NR , the dual of C is the set\n(5)\n\n\u010c := {\u03be \u2208 MR | \u03bd(\u03be) \u2265 0, \u2200 \u03bd \u2208 C}.\n\n\fDUALITY FOR TORIC LANDAU-GINZBURG MODELS\n\n5\n\nDefined similarly to the dual, is the polar of C \u2286 NR\nC \u25e6 := {\u03be \u2208 MR | \u03bd(\u03be) + 1 \u2265 0, \u2200 \u03bd \u2208 C}.\n\n(6)\n\nAssociated to a convex rational polyhedral set with non-empty interior is an\ninward normal fan. This is made up of rational convex polyhedral cones. A rational\nconvex polyhedral cone is rational convex polyhedral set closed under multiplication\nby R\u22650 , and it is called strongly convex if 0 is a vertex (i.e. {0} is a 0 dimensional\nface).\nA fan, \u03a3, is a non-empty finite collection of strongly convex rational polyhedral\ncones \u2282 NR such that\n(1) if \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 then all faces of \u03c3 are in \u03a3, and\n(2) the intersection of any two cones in \u03a3 is also in \u03a3.\nThe inward normal fan \u03a3P to P is defined to be the collection of cones\n(7)\n\n\u03c3f := {\u03bd \u2208 NR | \u03bd(\u03be) = min(\u03bd|P ), \u2200 \u03be \u2208 f }\n\nfor each face f of P .\nLemma 1.1. (see for instance [Ful93]) If P has non-empty interior, then \u03a3P is a\nfan.\nWe finish this discussion with some small, but useful results about the polar of\na convex set.\nLemma 1.2. If C is convex and 0 \u2208 int(C), then (C \u25e6 )\u25e6 = C.\nProof. C is determined by the affine half-spaces containing it. These half-spaces\ncontain 0 in their interior, so they have a defining inequality with constant part\n= 1. So we have C = \u2229\u03be\u2208C \u25e6 {\u03bd \u2208 NR | \u03bd(\u03be) + 1 \u2265 0}, and the result is clear.\n\u0003\nCorollary 1.3. Assume 0 \u2208 int(P ), then P \u25e6 = conv({\u03bdj /\u03b1j }rj=0 \u222a {0}).\nProof. Since \u03b1j > 0, P = conv({\u03bdj /\u03b1j }rj=0 \u222a {0})\u25e6 . Taking polars of convex sets\nreverses inclusions of convex sets, and preserves strictness for convex sets containing\n0.\n\u0003\nCorollary 1.4. Assume 0 \u2208 int(P ). Given \u03bd0 \u2208 MR and \u03b10 \u2208 R>0 . P is\ncontained in the affine half-space {\u03be \u2208 MR | \u03bd0 (\u03be) + \u03b10 \u2265 0} if and only if\n\u03bd0 /\u03b10 \u2208 conv({\u03bdj /\u03b1j }rj=0 \u222a {0}).\nToric varieties. A toric variety X is a normal irreducible complex algebraic variety\non which an algebraic torus T \u223c\n= (C\u00d7 )n acts and \u2203 x \u2208 X such that t 7\u2192 t * x defines\nan open immersion\n(8)\n\n\u03b9x : T ,\u2192 X.\n\nSome standard references for toric varieties are [Oda88, Ful93, Aud04].\nThe open immersion \u03b9x identifies characters \u03be : T \u2192 C\u00d7 with rational functions\non X. Since the divisor of a character is supported on the union of T -invariant\nsubvarieties, this gives the character-to-divisor map\n(9)\n\ndiv : M \u2192 ZR ,\n\nwhere M is the group of characters of T , and R := {\u03c11 , * * * , \u03c1r } is the set of\ncomponents of X \\ \u03b9x (T ). This means ZR is the set of T -invariant divisors of X.\n\n\f6\n\nPATRICK CLARKE\n\nThe cokernel of div is the Chow group An\u22121 (X). This group can often be\nidentified with the second integral cohomology group as the following theorem and\ncorollary state.\nTheorem 1.5. ([Ful93, pp. 63-64]) If Y is a complete toric variety, An\u22121 (Y ) =\nH2 (Y ; Z) and is torsion free.\nCorollary 1.6. If X is the total space of a split bundle of rank c over a complete\ntoric variety, Y , then X is toric, An\u22121 (X) = H2 (X, Z) = An\u22121\u2212c (Y ) = H2 (Y ; Z),\nand these groups are torsion free.\nDenote the cokernel of div by\n(10)\n\n[\u2212] : ZR \u2192 An\u22121 (X),\n\nand write the image of and element d \u2208 ZR by [d] \u2208 An\u22121 (X).\nConsequently, in the case of corollary 1.6 we have the sequence\n(11)\n\n0 \u2192 M \u2192 ZR \u2192 H2 (X; Z) \u2192 0,\n\nwhich is exact.\nFor toric varieties, the T -invariant divisor\n(12)\n\n\u2212 \u03baX := 1\u03c11 + * * * + 1\u03c1r\n\ngives a canonical choice of representative for the anticanonical divisor.\nThe group HomZ (ZR , C\u00d7 ) acts diagonally on CR , and thus so does HomZ (An\u22121 (X), C\u00d7 )\nvia the group homomorphism\n(13)\n\n(\u2212 \u25e6 [\u2212]) : HomZ (An\u22121 (X), C\u00d7 ) \u2192 HomZ (ZR , C\u00d7 )\n\ndefined by h 7\u2192 h \u25e6 [\u2212].\nIf we restrict the induced map on the cotangent space of the identity,\n(14)\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\nTId\nHomZ (ZR , C\u00d7 ) \u2192 TId\nHomZ (An\u22121 (X), C\u00d7 )\n\nto the lattice dual to the exponential kernel, we get f r \u25e6 [\u2212]. Here f r is the\nprojection of An\u22121 (X) onto An\u22121 (X)/torsion. For the main applications considered\nhere, An\u22121 (X) is torsion free, and so we can interpret [\u2212] as the pullback map on\ncovectors at the identity.\nUsing the action of HomZ (An\u22121 (X), C\u00d7 ) on CR , the quotient construction for\nprojective space generalizes to toric varieties.\nTheorem 1.7. (Cox [Cox95]) A toric variety, X, can be obtained as a (GIT)\nquotient of CR \\ P by HomZ (An\u22121 (X), C\u00d7 ) [Cox95]. P is a collection of coordinate\nsubspaces determined by the intersection theory on X.\nThe ring of regular functions on CR is called the Cox homogeneous coordinate\nring of X, and is generated by {X\u03c1 }\u03c1\u2208R . The degree of X\u03c1 is [1\u03c1] \u2208 An\u22121 (X).\nA more classical way to define a toric variety is from a fan of rational strongly\nconvex polyhedral cones. The construction of a toric variety goes as follows. Fix\na torus T and let M be its character group. Denote N = HomZ (M, Z) as before.\nLet \u03a3 be a fan of strongly convex rational polyhedral cones in NR . Then define\nthe toric variety X(\u03a3) acted on by T , to be the union of affine charts U\u03c3 for each\n\u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3. Where U\u03c3 is the spectrum of the subring of regular functions R\u03c3 on T that\nis generated by characters \u03be in the dual cone \u03c3\u030c.\nTheorem 1.8. (Sumihiro [Sum74, Sum75]) Every toric variety can be obtained via\nthe fan construction in a unique way.\n\n\fDUALITY FOR TORIC LANDAU-GINZBURG MODELS\n\n7\n\nFunctions on a toric variety. As indicated by the character-to-divisor map ((9)\nabove), the function theory of X is understood in terms of the function theory of\nthe torus T . The identification of rational function on X with those on T depends\non the choice of x defining the open immersion \u03b9x .\nIf W is a rational function on X,\nX\n(15)\n\u03b9\u2217x W =\nqj \u03bej\nj\n\nis the pullback to T , where \u03bej \u2208 M .\nIf one makes another choice, x0 , there is a unique element t \u2208 T such that\n0\nx = t * x. For the same function W ,\nX\nqj \u03bej (t)\u03bej .\n(16)\n\u03b9\u2217x0 W = \u03b9\u2217(t*x) W =\nj\n\u00d7 \u039e\n\nDenote by (C ) the space of functions on T with terms \u039e := {\u03be1 , * * * , \u03bes }. The\naction T \b (C\u00d7 )\u039e coming from the different choices of x \u2208 X is given by\n(17)\n\nt * (q1 \u03be1 + * * * + qs \u03bes ) = q1 \u03be1 (t)\u03be1 + * * * + qs \u03bes (t)\u03bes .\n\nIt is then natural to eliminate the dependence on x of the expression of \u03b9\u2217x W by\nthinking of W as an element the quotient\n(18)\n\nW \u2208 (C\u00d7 )\u039e /T.\n2. Linear data\n\nAssociated to a toric variety is the character-to-divisor map, div. It is a remarkable fact that this map is almost enough information to recover the original\ntoric variety. For instance, if the toric variety is projective and we are also given a\n(very) ample divisor class, a, in the Chow group (= coker(div)), the variety can be\nrecovered.\nWe will prove this, and a more general result concerning total spaces of split\nbundles over certain toric varieties. Motivated by this result we call the pair (div, a)\nthe linear data associated to X. Here a is an arbitrary element of An\u22121 (X)R .\nDefinition 2.1. Precisely, we define for an abelian group H, linear H-data. This\nthe following information:\n(1) a finite rank free abelian group G,\n(2) a homomorphism C : G \u2192 Zt , and\n(3) an element c \u2208 coker(C)H .\nA key fact, that we will exploit in our construction of the dual Landau-Ginzburg\nmodel, is that we can define linear C/Z-data associated to a function W on a toric\nvariety. Analogous to the case of projective toric varieties, the linear data associated\nto W recovers W .\nLinear data associated to a toric varieties. In section 1, we defined a polyhedral set from a homomorphism A : M \u2192 Zr , and an element \u03b1 \u2208 (Zr )R . If a\npolyhedral set had non-empty interior, we defined its inward normal fan. Finally,\nfrom a fan we defined a toric variety.\nInstead, we would like to use as our starting point the linear data\n(19)\n\n(A, a).\n\n\f8\n\nPATRICK CLARKE\n\nDefinition 2.2. Assume there exists \u03b1 \u2208 (Zr )R such that \u03b1 maps to a in coker(A),\nand (A, \u03b1) defines a rational convex polyhedral with non-empty interior. Define\nX(A, a) to be the toric variety defined by A and \u03b1.\nThe lemma below shows that X(A, a) is independent of the choice of \u03b1. Specifically, different choices of \u03b1 correspond to translation of the rational convex polyhedral set by an element of MR , and thus give the same inward normal fan.\nThe following notation for our polyhedral sets will be used throughout the paper.\n(20)\n\nP\u03b1 = {\u03be \u2208 MR | A(\u03be) + \u03b1 \u2265 0}.\n\nLemma 2.3. If \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b10 = A(\u03be0 ) then P\u03b10 = \u03be0 + P\u03b1 .\nProof. \u03be \u2208 P\u03b1 \u21d0\u21d2 A(\u03be)+\u03b1 \u2265 0 \u21d0\u21d2 A(\u03be)+A(\u03be0 )+\u03b10 \u2265 0 \u21d0\u21d2 A(\u03be +\u03be0 )+\u03b10 \u2265\n0 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03be + \u03be0 \u2208 P\u03b10 .\n\u0003\nTheorem 2.4. If Y is projective and a \u2208 An\u22121 (Y ) corresponds to a very ample\nline bundle then Y = X(div, a).\nProof. P\u03b1 is the polytope of T -linearized global sections of the very ample line\nbundle corresponding to a. The result is then the standard fact that the fan of Y\nis the normal cone fan of this polytope.\n\u0003\nThe following lemma helps us to get a concrete handle on the linear data associated with a line bundle over a toric variety. Note that we identify vectors with one\ncolumn matrices. Therefore homomorphisms are written as matrices that multiply\nvectors from the left.\nLemma 2.5. If D is a T -invariant Cartier divisor and E is the total space of a\nline bundle OY (\u2212D) over a toric variety Y , then the character group of E is\n(21)\n\nME = MY \u2295 Z\u03be,\n\nwhere \u03be is a rational section of OY (D) whose divisor is D. The T -invariant Weil\ndivisors of E are the preimages under p of the T -invariant Weil divisors of Y as\nwell as the image of the zero section \u03c30 : Y \u2192 E, and so\n\u0014\n\u0015\ndivY |\nD\n(22)\ndivE =\n0\n| \u03c30 (Y )\nwith respect to the decomposition of ME above and ZRE = ZRY \u2295 Z\u03c30 (Y ).\nProof. The function \u03be is a section of a line bundle, so it vanishes both over D when\n\u03be \u2261 0 and along the zero section \u03c30 (Y ). Other characters are pullbacks, so they\nvanish as they did on Y .\n\u0003\nTheorem 2.6. Assume Y = X(divY , a), and E = Tot \u0393(Y, OY (\u2212D1 ) \u2295 * * * \u2295\nOY (\u2212Dc )), and the Dj are T -invariant Cartier divisors with |Dj | basepoint free,\nthen E = X(divE , p\u2217 a). Where p : E \u2192 Y is the projection.\nProof. The pullback of a base-point free linear system is base-point free, so by\ninduction, it suffices to check this for when c = 1.\nIn this case E = Tot(OY (\u2212D)). The pullback map on divisors sending \u03c1 7\u2192\np\u22121 (\u03c1) induces the pullback map p\u2217 : An\u22121 (Y ) \u2192 An (E), and so if a = [\u03b1] then\np\u2217 a = [(\u03b1, 0)].\nThe polyhedral set P(\u03b1,0) is defined by the inequality divE (\u03be \u2295 s\u03be) + (\u03b1, 0) =\n(divY (m) + sD + \u03b1) \u2295 s\u03c30 (Y ) \u2265 0. Immediate observations we make are s \u2265 0\n\n\fDUALITY FOR TORIC LANDAU-GINZBURG MODELS\n\n9\n\nand P(\u03b1,0) \u2229 {s = s0 } = P\u03b1+s0 D \u2295 s0 . The second observation becomes important\nin light of the fact that |D| base-point free implies that |s0 D| is base-point free\nfor s0 \u2208 Z>0 , and very-ample plus base-point free implies very-ample. So P\u03b1+s0 D\nhas the same face structure as P\u03b1 and consequently the polytope Pp\u2217 a has the face\nstructure of P\u03b1 \u00d7 [0, \u221e).\nThe 1-cones in the fan of E and X(divE , p\u2217 a) are the same, and the agreement\nof face structures implies X(divE , p\u2217 a) is covered by charts centered at torus fixed\npoints of Y just like E. This implies the n-cones agree as well, and thus the full\nfans.\n\u0003\nLinear data associated to rational functions on toric varieties. In section 1\nwe introduced the homomorphism T \u2192 (C\u00d7 )\u039e , given by t 7\u2192 \u03be1 (t)\u03be1 + * * * + \u03bes (t)\u03bes .\nThis was used to write the space of rational functions on a toric variety with terms\n\u039e = {\u03be1 , * * * , \u03bes } as a quotient (C\u00d7 )\u039e /T .\nThe homomorphism induces a map between Lie algebras that is integral with\nrespect to the kernels of the exponential maps. The kernel of the exponential map\non T is typically denoted N , and is naturally identified with the dual space to\nthe characters, HomZ (M, Z), and the one parameter subgroups C \u2192 T (see for\ninstance [Ful93]). If we write Z\u039e for the kernel of the exponental map on (C\u00d7 )\u039e ,\nthe homomorphism between these lattices is\nmon : N \u2192 Z\u039e ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere mon is short for \"infinitesimal action on monomials\".\nThe isomorphism exp(2\u03c0i\u2212) : C/Z \u2192 C\u00d7 induces an isomorphism between the\nexact sequences\n(24)\n\nmon\n\nNC/Z \u2192 (Z\u039e )C/Z \u2192 coker(mon)C/Z \u2192 0\n\nand\n(25)\n\nT \u2192 (C\u00d7 )\u039e \u2192 (C\u00d7 )\u039e /T \u2192 1.\n\nThis uses the standard identification of T with NC\u00d7 .\nDefinition 2.7. Let W be a rational function on a toric variety, X, with terms \u039e.\nDenote by L \u2208 coker(mon)C/Z the point corresponding to W . We define the linear\nC/Z-data of W to be the pair (mon, L).\nLemma 2.8. Let \u03bb \u2208 C\u039e such that \u03bb maps to L in coker(mon)C/Z . Let W (mon, \u03bb)\nbe the function on T determined by mon and \u03bb, then there is a unique x \u2208 X such\nthat \u03b9\u2217 W = W (mon, \u03bb).\nProof. This is an immediate consequence of the definition of mon, or equivalently\nthe definition of the homomorphism T \u2192 (C\u00d7 )\u039e .\n\u0003\nIt is worth pointing out that W (mon, \u03bb) =\n\nP\n\nj\n\nexp(2\u03c0i\u03bbj )\u03bej .\n\nRemark 2.9. Despite the fact that the linear data of a rational function only determines the function up to the action of T , we will refer to the \"rational function\"\nW (mon, L). This is because the action of T will be viewed as a coordinate choice\nand not intrinsic to the situation.\n\n\f10\n\nPATRICK CLARKE\n\n3. Toric Landau-Ginzburg models\nIn the introduction, a Landau-Ginzburg model was a superconformal theory\ndefined by K\u00e4hler manifold, X, equipped with a holomorphic function W : X \u2192 C,\nwhere W is called the superpotential. It is common to add an additional piece of\ninformation called the B-field. This is simply a cohomology class b \u2208 H2 (X; R/Z).\nWe will use the term toric Landau-Ginzburg model to mean the following information:\n(1) a toric variety X,\n(2) an element K \u2208 An\u22121 (X)C/Z , and\n(3) a regular function W : X \u2192 C.\nThe class K = b+ia is thought of as the B-field, b, and the K\u00e4hler class, a, packaged\ntogether into a single \"complexified K\u00e4hler class\".\nIn the cases where corollary 1.6 applies, this is the same as a Landau-Ginzburg\nmodel except that we have retained only the class of the K\u00e4hler form and forgotten\nthe form itself.\nToric Landau-Ginzburg models defined by linear data. Associated to a toric\nLandau-Ginzburg model is its linear data:\n(1) the linear C/Z-data (div, K), and\n(2) the linear C/Z-data (mon, L),\nOne can also start from two sets of linear C/Z-data, (A, K), (B, L), and, provided the polyhedral set defined by (A, =(K)) has non-empty interior, define a toric\nvariety X(A, =(K)) and rational function W (B, L). Here =(K) denotes the imaginary part of K. This is not quite a toric Landau-Ginzburg model, because K may\nnot define a complexified K\u00e4hler class, or W may not be regular.\nDefinition 3.1. To avoid problematic situations, we will define linear R\u2212data\n(C, c) to be kopasetic if\n(1) the polyhedral set defined by (C, c) has non-empty interior, and\n(2) there exists a surjection k : Zr \u2192 ZRX(C,c) that sends standard generators\nto standard generators or zero, and the diagram\nC\n\nM\n\n@\n@\n\n(26)\n\ndivX(C,c)\n\n- Zr\nk\n\n@\nR ?\n@\nZRX(C,c)\n\ncommutes.\nWe will also denote by k the induced map on the cokernels.\nNote that k is essentially unique in the sense that it is constructed, by eliminating\nunnecessary inequalities from the family A(\u03be) + \u03b3 \u2265 0, where \u03b3 is a lift of c. Nonuniqueness arises if two of the inequalities are identical, in which case we drop one\nof them.\nTo address the regularity of W (B, L) we first make the simple observation that\na rational function W is regular if and only if all its monomials are regular, and a\nmonomial \u03be \u2208 MX is regular if and only if\n(27)\n\ndiv(\u03be) \u2265 0.\n\n\fDUALITY FOR TORIC LANDAU-GINZBURG MODELS\n\n11\n\nOne can easily use these facts to check the statement:\nLemma 3.2. W is regular \u21d0\u21d2 div \u25e6 mon\u03c4 \u2265 0.\nDefinition 3.3. With this in mind we define a pair of linear C/Z-data, (A, K),\nand (B, L), to be kopasetic if\n(1) (A, =(K)) is kopasetic, and\n(2) A \u25e6 B \u03c4 \u2265 0.\nDefinition 3.4. Given a pair of kopasetic linear C/Z-data, (A, K), and (B, L), we\ndefine a toric Landau-Ginzburg model with\n(1) the toric variety X(A, =(K)),\n(2) the regular function W (B, L), and\n(3) the complexified K\u00e4hler class k(K).\nThe dual toric Landau-Ginzburg model. So far we have seen how one can\nextract linear data from a toric Landau-Ginzburg data, and under kopasetic conditions define a toric Landau-Ginzburg model from a pair of linear C/Z-data.\nOn the level of linear data, there is a simple involution defined by simply interchanging the roles of (div, K), (mon, L).\nDefinition 3.5. Let (A, K), (B, L) be a pair of linear C/Z-data. Define the dual\npair (A0 , K 0 ), (B 0 , L0 ), by\n(28)\n\n(A0 , K 0 ) = (B, L), and, (B 0 , L0 ) = (A, K).\n\nDefinition 3.6. Given a toric Landau-Ginzburg model, (X, W, K), assume that\nthe dual to its linear data is kopasetic. Define the dual toric Landau-Ginzburg model\nto be the toric Landau-Ginzburg model defined by the dual linear data. Denote\nthe dual by (X 0 , W 0 , K 0 ).\nRemark 3.7. To check that the dual data is kopasetic, one only needs to verify that\n(A0 , =(K 0 )) is kopasetic since A0 \u25e6B 0\u03c4 = (A\u25e6B \u03c4 )\u03c4 , and W is regular so (A\u25e6B \u03c4 ) \u2265 0.\n4. The sigma model / Landau-Ginzburg model correspondence\nIn physics, a sigma model is a superconformal theory defined by K\u00e4hler manifold\nZ equipped with a B-field b \u2208 H2 (Z, R/Z). We will take a sigma model to be an\nalgebraic variety with a choice of complexified K\u00e4hler class in its Chow group of\ndivisors. This class will be a pullback from such a class on an ambient space.\nOne can produce interesting toric Landau-Ginzburg models from the sigma\nmodel / Landau-Ginzburg model correspondence applied to a complete intersection in a toric variety.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, when a subvariety Z of a variety Y is the zero\nlocus of a global section w of a vector bundle V, we can define a Landau-Ginzburg\nmodel. Strictly speaking, this information defines a morphism W : X \u2192 C from the\ntotal space of the dual bundle V \u2228 , X = Tot(V \u2228 ), to C. The morphism is defined\nby the pairing V \u2297 V \u2228 \u2192 OX that identifies sections of V with functions on X.\nIf Y is equipped with complexifed divisor class K \u2208 An\u22121 (Y )C/Z , then we can\npull it back to define a complexified divisor class on X. Also if Y is toric and V\nis split, then it is easy to see that X is a toric variety. So we make the following\ndefinition.\n\n\f12\n\nPATRICK CLARKE\n\nDefinition 4.1. Let V be a rank c split bundle over an n-dimensional toric variety\nY . Let w be a global section of V, and let K \u2208 An\u22121 (Y )C/Z . Finally let Z be the\nzero locus of w. We define toric Landau-Ginzburg model corresponding to (Z, K) to\nbe (X, W, K), where X = Tot(V \u2228 ), W is the function defined by w, and K is the\npullback to An+c\u22121 (X) of K \u2208 An\u22121 (Y ).\nNote that the resulting toric Landau-Ginzburg model actually depends on Y ,\nw \u2208 \u0393(Y, V), and K, rather than (Z, K). Also notice An+c\u22121 (X) = An\u22121 (Y ).\nRemark 4.2. As explained to us [Sha]: in the literature, when studying a sigma\nmodel Z it is a common trick to move to a \"Landau-Ginzburg point\" of the gauged\nlinear sigma model K\u00e4hler moduli space of Z to obtain a Landau-Ginzburg model\nwhose B-twist is the same as that of Z. We are not using this Landau-Ginzburg\nmodel. The Landau-Ginzburg model (X, W, K) and the sigma model (Z, K) lie in\nthe same universality class and so truly define the same superconformal theory. See\n[GS08] for a detailed treatment.\nLinear data associated to (X, W, K). An immediate consequence of lemma 2.5\nis the following formula for the map divX .\nCorollary 4.3.

Toric Landau-Ginzburg models dual to sigma models: existance\nCorollaries 4.3 and 4.7, give a very concrete picture of the linear data of a\ntoric Landau-Ginzburg model (X, W, K) obtained from a complete intersection Z\ndetermined by a global section w of a bundle V over a toric variety Y .\nIn this section, we show the dual data, (A0 , K 0 ), and (B 0 , L0 ) is kopasetic provided\n0\n(A , =(K 0 )) is kopasetic, as mentioned in remark 3.7. This involves checking two\nthings\n(1) the polytope defined by (A0 , =(K 0 )) has non-empty interior, and\n(2) there exists a surjection k as in equation (26).\nLemma 5.1. Assuming the codimension, c, of Z is positive, (A0 , =(K 0 )) is kopasetic\nfor all values of =(K 0 ).\n\n\f14\n\nPATRICK CLARKE\n\nProof. The existence of k is immediate, since the columns of mon\u03c4W distinct an\nprimitive. Now let \u03b10 denote a lift of =(K 0 ), and consider the polyhedral set\nP\u03b10 . The inward normals of facets of P\u03b10 form a subset of the columns of mon\u03c4W .\n0\nThese normals\nP all live in the interior of the half-space of NR = (MX )R , H = {\u03be \u2208\n(MX )R |\nj \u03c6j (\u03be) \u2265 0}, where the \u03c6j are as in equation (34). The lemma now\nfollows from the following statement: The intersection of affine half-spaces, such\nthat the non-negative R-span of their normals does not contain a half-space, is\nnon-empty.\nDefine C to be the cone dual to the cone defined by the non-negative span of the\ncolumns of mon\u03c4W . C has 0 as an apex since its dual is contained in a half-space,\nand more importantly it has a non-empty interior since its properly contained in a\nhalf-space. If p \u2208 P\u03b1 is is clear that p + C \u2282 P\u03b1 since the affine half-spaces defining\nP\u03b1 can only be translates away from p. On the other hand P\u03b1 can be obtained by\nintersection translates of half-planes containing C, so it is clear that P\u03b1 6= \u2205. \u0003\nCorollary 5.2. A toric Landau-Ginzburg model (X, W, K) obtained from a complete intersection Z 6= Y determined by a global section w of a bundle V over a\ntoric variety Y has a dual toric Landau-Ginzburg model (X 0 , W 0 , K 0 ).\n6. Toric Landau-Ginzburg models dual to sigma models: structure\nThe toric variety X 0 is very closely related to the total space E 0 of some vector\nbundle (V 0 )\u2228 over a toric variety Y 0 . We will define these objects below.\nWe proceed to give sufficient conditions under which X 0 = E 0 , first in terms of\nthe columns of mon\u03c4W , or equivalently the rows of A0 . Finally, if X 0 = E 0 then we\ngive conditions under which W 0 comes from a global section of V 0 . In other words,\nwe give conditions under which we can construct a dual sigma model (Z 0 , K 0 ) to\nthe sigma model (Z, K) corresponding to (X, W, K).\nThe toric varieties Y 0 and E 0 . Corollary 4.7, describing mon\u03c4W , implies that\nsince A0 = monW it has the block form\n\u0014 0\n\u0015\nd | D0\n0\n(35)\nA =\n.\n0 | Id\nThis is with respect to the decompositions NX = NY \u2295 Z\u03c61 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Z\u03c6c and\n\u00d7\nZ\u039e = Z\u039e \u2295 Z01 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Z0c .\nThe identity matrix in the lower right block guarantees coker(A0 ) = coker(d0 ).\n\u00d7\nThus we can find a lift of =(K 0 ) of the form (\u03b10 , 0), where \u03b10 \u2208 Z\u039e . We would like\nto make the definition Y 0 = X(d0 , =(K 0 )), but unfortunately, there is no guarantee\nthat (d0 , =(K 0 )) is kopasetic.\nWe will make the assumption that (d0 , =(K 0 )) is kopasetic. This is a comfortable\nassumption to make in light of the following lemma.\nLemma 6.1. There is a non-empty open cone Ukopa of coker(d0 ) such that (d0 , a0 )\nis kopasetic if and only if a0 \u2208 Ukopa .\nProof. An affine half-space can be translated to contain the origin within its interior.\nChoose such an arrangement for all the affine half-spaces with inward normals\ncoming from the row of d0 . This corresponds to a point a00 \u2208 coker(d0 ). The\norigin remains in the interior of the intersection the of the half-spaces for small\ndeformations of a0 such that (d0 , a0 ) is kopasetic.\n\u0003\n\n\fDUALITY FOR TORIC LANDAU-GINZBURG MODELS\n\n15\n\nNote that it is standard to interpret moving from one value a00 to another a0 as\na deformation of the symplectic structure of the toric variety X(d0 , a00 ). This may\ninvolve birational transformations corresponding to when the volumes of curves (or\nhigher dimensional subvarieties) shrink to 0.\nDefinition 6.2. Define the toric variety\nY 0 = X(d0 , =(K 0 )).\n\n(36)\n\nDenote the map of equation (26) by kY 0 and the columns of D0 by Dj0 . These are\n\u00d7\nelements of Z\u039e . We now have the vector bundle\n(37)\n\nV 0 = OY 0 (kY 0 (D10 )) \u2295 * * * \u2295 OY 0 (kY 0 (Dc0 )),\n\nthe toric variety\n(38)\n\nE 0 = Tot(HomOY 0 (V 0 , OY 0 )),\n\nand a function W 0 defined on it by B 0 and L0 .\nConditions for X 0 = E 0 .\nDefinition 6.3. We will spend the rest of the section discussing the \"rows\" of the\n\u00d7\nhomomorphisms A0 : MX 0 \u2192 Z\u039e and d0 : MY 0 \u2192 Z\u039e . By this we mean the images\nunder the transpose of the standard basis vectors. The rows of d0 may be a multiset.\nKeep in mind that we will be using the follow identifications.\n\n(39)\n\nM Y = NY 0\nNY = MY 0\nM X = NE 0\nNX = ME 0\n\n,\n,\n, and\n.\n\nThe strategy for comparing X 0 and E 0 is based on comparing divX 0 and divE 0 .\nBoth of these toric varieties are defined from rational convex polyhedral sets. The\ndefining inequalities for X 0 come directly from the matrix A0 = monW , and the\nelement a0 \u2208 coker(A0 )C/Z .\nOn the other hand E 0 is formed by first using the upper left block, d0 , of A0 to\ndefine the toric variety Y 0 . Then a certain submatrix of the upper right block D0 ,\nof the A0 are treated as divisors and we get the family of inequalities coming from\nthe formula in equation (4.3).\nWe will compare\ndivX 0 = kX 0 \u25e6 A0\nand\n\u0014\n\u0015\nkY 0 \u25e6 d0 | kY 0 \u25e6 D0\ndivE 0 =\n.\n0\n|\nId\nPost-composition with k results in deleting rows whose affine half-space is not\nnecessary for defining the polytope. We need some conditions under which the\nrows deleted from A0 using kX 0 are the same of those deleted using kY 0 . Recall, the\nrows of A0 are of the form (PDj \u2229 MY ) \u00d7 {\u03c3j }.\nThe only case when such a comparison make sense is when a0 lifts to (\u03b10 , 0) \u2208\n\u00d7\nZ\u039e \u2295 Z01 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Z0c , such that \u03b10 > 0, as pointed out in the lemma below.\nLemma 6.4. If E 0 is defined (i.e. (d0 , a0 ) is kopasetic), then a0 has a lift as above.\nProof. Choose \u03b10 so that 0 lies in the interior of the polyhedral set defining Y 0 . \u0003\n\n\f16\n\nPATRICK CLARKE\n\nDefinition\n6.5. Let \u03b10 = (\u03b110 , * * * , \u03b1c0 ) with respect to the decomposition \u039e\u00d7 =\n`\n\u00d7\n0\n0\nj (\u0393(Y, OY (Dj )) \u2229 \u039e ). Furthermore, we can write \u03b1j in components as \u03b1j =\n0\n(\u03b1(\u03bd,\u03c3j ) )\u03bd\u2208P \u00d7 .\nDj\n\nLemma 6.6. The facets of the polytope of X 0 correspond to the non-zero vertices\nof the convex hull Cj points\n(40)\n\n\u00d7\n0\n| \u03bd \u2208 PD\n{(\u03bd, \u03c3j )/\u03b1(\u03bd,\u03c3\n\u2229 MY } \u222a {\u03bb(0, \u03c3j ) | 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2208 R},\nj)\nj\n\nincluding the vertex \"\u221e(0, \u03c3j )\".\nProof. If we deform (\u03b10 , 0) to (\u03b10 , \u000f), we can use corollary 1.4 to write the dual\npolytope to the one defined by A0 can be expressed as the convex hull of the points\n0\n(\u03bd, \u03c3j )/\u03b1(\u03bd,\u03c3\nand (0, \u03c3j )/\u000f, j = 1, * * * , c.\nj)\nIf a convex polyhedral set C in a vectorspace V \u2295 W defined by points that lie\nin either V \u2295 {0} or {0} \u2295 W . Has vertices that are exactly the vertices of convex\nhull of the points in V \u2295 {0} and the vertices of the convex hull of the points in\nC \u2229 {0} \u2295 W .\nPutting these facts together and taking the limit \u000f \u2192 0 gives the result.\n\u0003\nDefinition 6.7. Denote the projection (MY 0 )R \u2295R\u03c3j \u2192 (MY 0 )R , by \u03c0j , the vertices\nof Cj by Vj , and the set Vj \\ {(0, 0), (0, \u03c3j )} by Vj\u00d7 .\n\u00d7\nTheorem 6.8. A row \u03bd \u2208 PD\nappears in divY 0 iff \u03c0j ((\u03bd, \u03c3j )/\u03b1\u03bd ) defines a nonS j\nzero vertex of conv({0} \u222a j \u03c0j (Vj )).\n0\n0\nProof. The projection takes (\u03bd, \u03c3j )/\u03b1(\u03bd,\u03c3\nto \u03bd/\u03b1(\u03bd,\u03c3\n, and it is the convex hull of\nj)\nj)\n{0} and these points is exactly the dual polytope to the on defined by (d0 , \u03b10 ). \u0003\n0\nTheorem 6.9. (Assuming a0 has a lift as above) XS\n= E 0 if and only if, for all j,\n\u00d7\nevery element in Vj defines a vertex of conv({0} \u222a j \u03c0j (Vj )).\n\nProof. This simply states that the rows are the same, which is exactly what we\nneed.\n\u0003\nThe dual superpotential. Finally, we discuss the superpotential W 0 on the dual.\nFirst we discuss arbitrary functions on the total space, E 0 , of a split vector bundle\nover a toric variety Y 0 .\nLet Y 0 be a toric variety, {D10 , * * * , Dc0 } a set of T -invariant divisors, and f a\nfunction on E 0 := Tot(OY (\u2212D10 ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 OY (\u2212Dc0 )). We want to know when f\ncomes from a global section of OY (D10 ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 OY (Dc0 ).\nThe character group of E 0 is given by MY 0 \u2295Z\u03be10 \u2295* * *\u2295Z\u03bec0 . Meromorphic global\nsections have the form f = f1 \u03be10 + * * * + fc \u03bec0 , where the fj 's have terms in MY 0 . The\nkey here is that f is a linear form in the \u03be 0 's. As we mentioned before in equation\n(27), \u03bc \u2208 ME 0 is regular iff divE 0 (\u03bc) \u2265 0.\nNow, assume that X = Tot(OY (\u2212D1 ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 OY (\u2212Dc )) over a toric variety Y .\nAlso assume the dual toric variety X(A0 , a0 ) equals E 0 .\nLemma 6.10. W 0 comes from a global section exactly when \u2203 effective T -invariant\ndivisors on X such that D\u03031 , * * * , D\u0303c such that Dj \u223c D\u0303j , and D\u03031 + * * * + D\u0303c =\n\u2212\u03baX . Where \u2212\u03baX is the canonical choice of anticanonical divisor representative of\nequation (12).\n\n\fDUALITY FOR TORIC LANDAU-GINZBURG MODELS\n\n17\n\nProof. The terms of W 0 are the rows of A = divX . The lemma is then clear from\nthe matrix of A\u03c4 , see theorem 4.3.\n\u0003\nRemark 6.11. The dual to (X 0 , W 0 , K 0 ) is computed from the dual of its linear\ndata. This data is the same as that of (X, W, K) except some rows of monW may\nhave been deleted. This means that the double dual of (X, W, K) is (X, W \u2212 , K),\nwhere X and K are the same and W \u2212 is obtained from W by deleting some terms.\nIf (X, W, K) is obtained from a sigma model then (X, W \u2212 , K) comes from a\nsigma model in the same ambient space and the same bundle. However the sigma\nmodels might differ by a complex deformation. It is possible that this unfortunate\ndiscrepancy can be addressed with a slight modification of the dualization process.\nWe will explain this in the discussion section the end of this paper.\nAn example: three points on P1 . A configuration on three points on P1 corresponds to a Landau-Ginzburg model X = Tot(OP1 (\u22123)), W , and K. If we identify\nX with the blow up of C2 /Z3 at the fixed point, W is the pullback of a degree three\nhomogeneous polynomial on C2 pushed forward to a function on the quotient.\nThe character group is generated by elements that correspond to u/v and u2 v\non C2 . With respect to these coordinates we have\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n1 1\n1 2\n\uf8ef \u22121 1 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n(41)\ndivX = \uf8f0 \u22121 1 \uf8fb , and monW = \uf8ef\n\uf8f0 \u22122 1 \uf8fb .\n0 1\n0 1\nIf we write x and y for the coordinates dual to these on X 0 , there are four possibilities\nfor X 0 depending on the choice of W . These are indicated by the polyhedral sets in\nfigure 1. If \u039b is a lift of L, examples of values that give these are =(\u039b) = (\u03b10 , 0) =\n(0, 2, 5, 0), (0, 3, 5, 0), (\u22121, \u22121, 0, 0), and (\u22121, 0, \u22121, 0) respectively.\n2\n\nW' = q xy + y/x + y\n\nP1\n\nP3\n\nP2\n\nP4\n\nFigure 1. Mirror possibilities for three points on P1 .\nThe inward normals come from the rows of monW . The superpotential W 0 above,\nhas monomials whose exponent vectors are the rows of divX . q is determined K\nby choosing a lift of K of the form (\u03b2 + i\u03b1, 0, 0) and setting q = exp(\u22122\u03c0(\u03b1 + i\u03b2)).\nW 0 is not linear in y, so it will not come from a global section of E 0 .\n\n\f18\n\nPATRICK CLARKE\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n1\nd0 = \uf8f0 \u22121 \uf8fb\n\u22122\n\n(42)\n\nThe toric variety Y 0 is given by the polyhedral set in R defined by\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n1\n\uf8f0 \u22121 \uf8fb \u03be + \u03b10 \u2265 0 .\n(43)\n\u22122\nFor the polyhedral set P1, (d0 , a0 ) is kopasetic. The other polyhedral sets can\ngive kopasetic data at specific values. For example P2 for \u03b10 = (0, 1, 2, 0), P3 for\n\u03b10 = (\u22121, \u22121, 0, \u22121), and P4 for \u03b10 = (0, 0, 0, 0). One can easily check this by\nnoting that the rows d0 that define facets, must be primitive for the map k to exist.\nHowever, we will only look at P1 since these other cases do not shed more light on\nthe situation.\nIn this case\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n(44)\ndivY 0 =\n,\n\u22121\nand k projects onto the first two basis vectors, so k((0, 2, 5, 0)) = (0, 2).\nFor the divisors we have\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\n\u0014 \u0015\n1\n1\n.\n(45)\nD0 = D10 = \uf8f0 1 \uf8fb , and k(D10 ) =\n1\n1\nThis means that Y 0 = P1 , and E 0 is the total space of O(\u22122). The polytope\ncorresponding to this toric variety is below.\n\nFigure 2. Tot O(\u22122) over P1 .\nThis figure does not agree with P1. This is predicted by theorem 6.9 since all\nfacets are present, but for Y 0 not all are needed. One interesing thing that is\napparent in this example and happens in general is that the elements of Vj\u00d7 that\nare not vertices of conv(\u03c0j (Vj\u00d7 )) serve to partially compactify E 0 . Furthermore,\nboth E 0 and X 0 (A0 , =(K 0 )) are always local Calabi-Yau (i.e. have trivial canonical\nclass).\n7. Comparison: Givental and Hori-Vafa\n7.1. Givental.

We restate our assumptions about\nY and V for clarity.\n\nTheorem 7.1. Assume Y is smooth and there is no point that lies on (\u03c3)0 for all\n+\n0\n0\n0\n\u03c3 \u2208 \u0393(Y, V).

Here q\u0302\u03c5 := exp(t\u0302\u03c5 ).\nProof. Since Y is complete, applying Hom(\u2212, Z) to equation (11) yields the exact\nsequence\n(54)\n\n0\n\n0 \u2192 H2n\u22122 (Y ; Z)\u2228 \u2192 Hom(Z\u039e , Z) \u2192 MX 0 \u2192 0.\n\n\f20\n\nPATRICK CLARKE\n\nThe image of the standard basis vectors satisfy relations coming from the rows of\n\u0002\n\u0003\nM | \u2212D .\n(55)\nTherefore, H 0 = Spec(C[ \u03be 0 | \u03be 0 \u2208 \u039e0 ]).\n+\nIt remains to check that the terms of W 0 generate the semigroup MX\n0 . All of\n+\nthe terms are global, so they lie in MX 0 .\nThe terms of W 0 are the same as the inward normals of the polytope defining\n+\nthe original toric variety X, and their R\u22650 -span intersected with MX 0 is MX\n0 . One\nway to see this is to consider a 1-parameter subgroup \u03bd of T that does not lie in the\nfan of X. Consider the fan of the projective bundle compactifying X to a complete\ntoric variety. Then it is clear that lim\u03bb\u21920 \u03bd(\u03bb) lies in on the divisor at infinity. All\nof the monomials defining W have a pole along this divisor and there is no chance\nthat all the terms of W have \u03bd(0) on their divisor of zeros since this would mean\nthat the sections they correspond to would all vanish at the point \u03bd(0) projects to\nin Y . Finally, this means that there is at least one term for which the limit at \u03bd(0)\n+\nis infinity, and so n is not in MX\n0.\nIt remains to check positive integer multiples of these normals pick up every integer point in the cone they define. The cone they generate is naturally decomposed\ninto the fan of X. Since the fan is contained in a half-space, we pick up all integral\npoints with integral linear combinations of the normals if and only if X is smooth.\n0\nThe last observation needed to guarantee that we land in HQ\nunder the isomorQ mi\u03c5\nphism above is that Qi = \u03c5 q\u0302\u03c5 .\n\u0003\nWe see from the proof that if there is a point at which all global sections vanish,\n+\n0\nthen Spec(C[MX\n0 ]) is an affine open set of HQ . If Y is singular, then there is an\n+\n+\n0\n0\n\u00e9tale map Spec(C[MX 0 ]) \u2192 HQ . In any case we have a map Spec(C[MX\n0 ]) \u2192 HQ .\nThe last thing to check is that F pulls back to W 0 , but this is obvious from the\ndefinition of the isomorphism.\nSo we get the following theorem.\nTheorem 7.2. There is a morphism X 0 \u2192 Cr+c such the image is HQ and the\nfunction F (x, y) = x1 + * * * + xr + y1 + * * * + yc pulls back to W 0 . This morphism\nis naturally interpreted as the result of the K\u00e4hler degeneration of X 0 under which\nK0\n0.\nRemark 7.3. If L already equals zero, then X 0 = HQ . The section corresponding\nto L = 0 of V is the wGHV mentioned in the introduction.\n7.2. Hori and Vafa.

Comparison: Batyrev-Borisov\nIn order to describe precisely the construction of Batyrev and Borisov, we require\nseveral more definitions.\nDefinition 9.1. [Bat94] A lattice polytope P \u2282 MR with 0 \u2208 int(P ) is called\nreflexive if P \u25e6 also a lattice polytope. It is clear that P \u25e6 is also reflexive.\n\n\fDUALITY FOR TORIC LANDAU-GINZBURG MODELS\n\n23\n\nRemark 9.2. In light of corollary 1.4, reflexivity simply means that P = {\u03bc \u2208\nMR | \u03bd(\u03bc) + 1 \u2265 0, where \u03bd is a primitive inward normal}. This is the same as\nsaying that P is the anticanonical polytope of a toric variety. In particular, such a\nP is be the anticanonical polytope of the toric variety it defines.\nDefinition 9.3. [Bor93] If P is a reflexive polytope, and \u03a3P its inward normal\nfan, a nef-partition of vert(P ) is a partition {E1 , * * * , Ec } of vert(P ) such that there\nexist integral convex \u03a3P -piecewise linear functions \u03c61 , * * * , \u03c6c on MR satisfying\n\u03c6i (ej ) = \u03b4(i \u2212 j) for ej \u2208 Ej .\nRemark 9.4. It is standard procedure in the theory of toric varieties to equate an\nintegral convex function \u03c6j with a T -invariant Cartier divisor Dj on X(\u03a3). In our\ncase, Dj is the sum of divisors who corresponding facet of P has its inward normal\nin Ej .\nIf Y is a toric variety defined by a reflexive polytope P , it will be more natural\nto consider nef-partitions of P \u25e6 .\nDefinition 9.5. [Bor93] Let P \u25e6 be a reflexive polytope and {E1 , * * * , Ec } a nef\npartition of vert(P \u25e6 ).

Then\n\u2217 \u25e6\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217 \u25e6\n(P ) is reflexive, and {E1 , * * * , Ec } is a nef partition of vert((P ) ) [Bor93, Prop\n3.4]. {E\u22171 , * * * , E\u2217c } is called the dual nef partition to {E1 , * * * , Ec }.\nDefinition 9.6. We will write P \u2217 for ((P \u2217 )\u25e6 )\u25e6 .\nDefinition 9.7. Let Y be a toric variety defined by the reflexive polytope P , and let\n{E1 , * * * , Ec } a nef partition of vert(P \u25e6 ) with corresponding divisors {D1 , * * * , Dc }.\nFrom this define Y \u2217 to be the toric variety defined by P \u2217 , {E\u22171 , * * * , E\u2217c } the dual\nnef partition, and {D1\u2217 , * * * , Dc\u2217 } the corresponding divisors on Y \u2217 .

A nef sub-partition is a Givental collection such that vert(C) =\n\u222aj vert(Cj ), and Cj =\n6 \u2205 for all j.\nThe following theorem allows us to express Borisov's notion of nef partition in\nthese terms.\nTheorem 9.11. If Y defined by a reflexive polytope P = P\u2212\u03baY , a Calabi\u2013Yau nef\nsub-partiton is the same as a nef partition of vert((P\u2212\u03baY )\u25e6 ).\n\n\f24\n\nPATRICK CLARKE\n\nProof. Given a Calabi\u2013Yau nef sub-partition, define Ej = set of primitive inward\nnormals to the affine half-spaces corresponding the the toric divisors appearing as\nsummands of Dj . Now define \u03c6j (\u03bd) = \u2212inf \u03bc\u2208PDj (\u03bd(\u03bc)). Then the definition of\nPDj guarantees the \u03c6i (ej ) = \u03b4(i \u2212 j) as needed. So {E1 , * * * , Ec } is a nef-partition\n(definition 9.3).\nNow assume we have a nef-partition of vert((P\u2212\u03baY )\u25e6 ). Since Y is Fano, these\nvertices are primitive inward normals to the affine hypersurfaces that correspond\nto toric divisors of Y . Define Dj := sum of toric divisors whose primitive inward\nnormal is in Ej . This trivially gives a Givental, Calabi\u2013Yau collection. It remains\nto check the nef sub-partition condition. This is proved in [Bor93, Prop 3.4].\n\u0003\nDefinition 9.12. Let Y be a Fano toric variety, and {D1 , * * * , Dc } a Calabi-Yau\nnef sub-partition and V = OY (D1 ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 OY (Dc ). Identify integral points PDj\nwith a basis for global sections of OY (Dj ).

Let Y be an n dimensional Fano toric variety, {D1 , * * * , Dc } a\nCalabi-Yau nef sub-partition, and V = OY (D1 ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 OY (Dc ). Let X be the\ntotal space of the dual, V \u2228 , and WBB : X \u2192 C the superpotential defined by wBB .\nFor arbitrary K \u2208 An\u22121 (Y ), the Landau-Ginzburg model (X 0 , W 0 , K 0 ), dual to\n(X, W, K), has X 0 = Tot((V \u2217 )\u2228 ) and W 0 comes from a global section of V \u2217 .\n0\nProof. The choice of WBB means that on the dual K 0 = (\u03b10 , 0), with \u03b1(\u03bd,\u03c3\n=1\nj)\n\u00d7\n0 0\nfor all \u03bd \u2208 PDj \u2229 MY .

The projection is (PD\n\u2229\nj\nj\nMY ) \u2282 (MY )R . The nef sub-partition condition and theorem 6.9 guarantee that\nX 0 = E 0 = Tot((V 0 )\u2228 ) over Y 0 .\nIf we denote the polytope defining Y by P , it remains to show that Y 0 is defined\nby P \u2217 , and Dj0 = Dj\u2217 . The first fact follows from checking that PDj0 = \u2206j , where\nP\n\u2206j = conv({0} \u222a Ej ).

An example: elliptic curves in (P1 )2\nWe consider elliptic curves on (P1 )2 . This is a nice example since many of the\nfeatures of our duality are exhibited and the dimension is low enough so that we\ncan actually draw the polytopes involved. Also, since they are Calabi\u2013Yau, duality\ncan be compared to the Batyrev\u2013Borisov, Givental, and Hori\u2013Vafa constructions.\nLet Z be an effective divisor with Z \u223c D, where D is a T -invariant (2, 2) divisor\non Y = (P1 )2 . Z is an elliptic curve. This can be seen using the adjunction formula,\n\u03baZ = (\u03baY + Z)|Z , and the fact \u03baY = (\u22122, \u22122).\nIn order to write down the Landau-Ginzburg model corresponding to Z as in\nsection 4, we will use the inclusion (C\u00d7 )2x,y ,\u2192 Y defined by the point ([1 : 1], [1 :\n1]) \u2208 Y and the action (x, y) * ([a : b], [c : d]) = ([a : xb], [c : yd]).

Discussion\nThe duality introduced here provides a simple framework under which all existing\nmirror candidate constructions for complete intersections fall. It is also holds some\npromise for use in homological mirror symmetry since it often provides partial\nresolutions when the mirror according to other constructions is singular.\nThe main short coming in the construction is the apparent asymmetry that\nsometimes happens under double dualization. This was mentioned in remark 6.11.\nIt was pointed out to us by Lev Borisov that a possible fix would be to include in\nthe dualization procedure a pair of (formal) automorphisms of FA : coker(A)C/Z \u2192\ncoker(B 0 )C\u00d7 , and FB : coker(B)C\u00d7 \u2192 coker(A0 )C/Z .\nIn the construction as defined here we are simply using the maps FA = exp(2\u03c0i\u2212)\n1\nand FB = 2\u03c0i\nlog(\u2212). These would take K to exp(2\u03c0iL0 ) and exp(2\u03c0iL) to K 0 . We\ncould replace these with arbitrary maps, so long as FB 0 \u25e6FA = Id, and FB \u25e6FA0 = Id,\nand all the results in the paper would still hold.\nThe \"correct\" maps FA and FB should be closely related to the mirror map\nrelating the moduli space of complex structures of a sigma model Z, and the moduli\nspace of complexified K\u00e4hler structures of the mirror sigma model Z 0 . In the\ncase when both our Landau-Ginzburg models correspond to sigma models, then\ncoker(B)C/Z should map to the moduli MK of complexified K\u00e4hler structures of Z\nand coker(A0 )C\u00d7 to the moduli, ML0 of complex structures of Z 0 . This should lead\nto a commutative diagram\n(93)\n\ncoker(B)C/Z\n\u2193\nMK\n\nFB\n\n\u2192\n\nmirror\n\n\u2192\n\ncoker(A0 )C\u00d7\n\u2193\n.\nML0\n\nNailing down the exact maps FA and FB in general requires more than what\nis known about the mirror map since we hope that homological mirror symmetry\ncould be made to work for more than just Calabi-Yau manifolds. It is the subject of\nfurther research to understand mirror symmetry and the mirror map in this more\ngeneral setting.\n\n\fDUALITY FOR TORIC LANDAU-GINZBURG MODELS\n\n31\n\nReferences\n[Aud04]\n\nMich\u00e8le Audin.
