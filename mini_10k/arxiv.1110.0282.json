No excess\nabove the Standard Model expectation is observed, and the results are interpreted using the simplified models.\n\n1. Introduction\nATLAS [1] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [2] recorded 2.55 fb\u22121 of data by the end of August [3]. We\nare truly entering the TeV-scale, and starting to have a wide coverage over possible Supersymmetry (SUSY)\nmodels. In order to ensure that all the relevant phase space is covered, searches should not be over-driven by\nspecific high energy scale SUSY models.\nThe simplified model approach [4][5][6] is one of the most promising model-independent strategies for new\nphysics searches, being widely discussed both in the experimental and theoretical communities [7].\nIn these proceedings, the overview of the simplified model approaches used in ATLAS is presented. Brief\ndescriptions of the ATLAS detector and dataset used in the analyses follow. Searches and simplified model\ninterpretations in the no-lepton channel with 1.04 fb\u22121 of data from 2011 and the same-sign dilepton channel\nwith 35 pb\u22121 of data from 2010 are described. The status of b-jet channel using simplified models is mentioned\nin [8].\n\n2. Simplified Models\nSimplified models are effective models built with the minimal particle content necessary to produce SUSYlike final states contributing to the channels of interest and are parametrized directly in terms of the sparticle\nmasses. They naturally allow for reducing the dimensionality of the theoretical parameter space to two to four\nsparticle mass parameters and relevant branching ratios. Figure 1 shows the simplified decay chains considered\nin ATLAS. This approach allows to scan the whole sparticle mass plane without imposing a strict relation on\nthe gaugino masses as are the cases in many of the high energy scale SUSY models such as mSUGRA [9][10].\nFurthermore, the results can be expressed in terms of limits on cross-section times branching ratios as a function\nof new particle masses, separately for each event topology, or even down to each diagram, thus disentangling\nassumptions on the relative couplings at each vertex. The simplified model framework is a complementary\napproach to phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (pMSSM) [11].\nThe results are therefore generic and can serve as an interface to theories with additional Standard Model\n(SM) partner particles (e.g. Universal Extra Dimensions, UED [12]), which make predictions in these topologies.\n\n3. The ATLAS Detector and Data Samples\nThe ATLAS detector is a multipurpose particle physics apparatus with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and near 4\u03c0 coverage in solid angle 1 . The inner tracking detector (ID) covers the pseudorapidity\nrange |\u03b7| < 2.5, and consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon microstrip detector (SCT), and, for |\u03b7| < 2.0,\na transition radiation tracker (TRT). The ID is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2T\n\n1 ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the center of the detector\nand the z-axis coinciding with the axis of the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the center of the LHC ring, and the y\naxis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (r,\u03c6) are used in the transverse plane, \u03c6 being the azimuthal angle around the beam\npipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \u03b8 as \u03b7 = \u2212ln tan(\u03b8/2).\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\nFigure 1: Simplified decay chains considered in ATLAS.\n\nmagnetic field. A high-granularity liquid-argon (LAr) sampling electromagnetic calorimeter covers the region\n|\u03b7| < 3.2. An iron-scintillator tile hadron calorimeter provides coverage in the central rapidity range of |\u03b7| < 1.7.\nThe end-cap and forward regions, spanning 1.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.9, are instrumented with LAr calorimetry for both\nelectromagnetic and hadronic measurements. The muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeters and\nconsists of three large air-core superconducting toroids, a system of precision tracking chambers up to |\u03b7| < 2.7,\nand detectors for triggering in the region of |\u03b7| < 2.4.\nFor the no-lepton search, the data are collected in 2011 with the LHC operating at a centre-of-mass energy of\n7 TeV. Application of beam, detector and data-quality requirements results in a total integrated luminosity of\n1.04 \u00b1 0.04 fb\u22121 with an estimated uncertainty of 3.7% [13]. The trigger requires events to contain a leading jet\nwith a transverse momentum (pT ), measured at the raw electromagnetic (EM) scale, above 75 GeV and missing\nmiss\ntransverse energy (ET\n) above 45 GeV.\nThe data used for the same-sign dilepton analysis are recorded in 2010 at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy\nof 7 TeV. Similarly to the 2011 data, the application of beam, detector, and data-quality requirements results in\na total integrated luminosity of 35 pb\u22121 with an estimated uncertainty of 11% [14]. The data are selected with\nsingle lepton (electron or muon) triggers. The detailed trigger requirements vary throughout the data-taking\nperiod owing to the rapidly increasing LHC luminosity and the commissioning of the trigger system, but always\nensure that leptons with pT >20 GeV lie in the efficiency plateau. Monte Carlo (MC) simulation samples for\nbackground processes are generated as described in [15].\n\n4. Object Definition\nJet candidates are reconstructed using the anti-kt jet clustering algorithm [16][17] with a distance parameter\nof 0.4. The inputs to this algorithm are three-dimensional clusters of calorimeter cells [18] seeded by those with\nenergy significantly above the measured noise. Jet momenta are constructed by performing a four-vector sum\nover these calorimeter clusters, treating each as an (E, p~) four-vector with zero mass. These jets are corrected\nfor the effects of calorimeter non-compensation and inhomogeneities by using pT and \u03b7-dependent calibration\nfactors based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and validated with extensive test-beam and collision-data studies\n[19]. Furthermore, for 2011 data, the average additional energy due to multiple events in a single beam crossing\n(pile-up) is subtracted using correction constants extracted from data, and the reconstructed jet is modified\nsuch that the jet direction points to the primary vertex of the interaction instead of the geometrical center of\nthe ATLAS detector. Only jet candidates with transverse momenta pT > 20 GeV are subsequently retained.\nElectron candidates are required to have pT > 20 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.47, and pass the 'medium' electron shower\nshape and track selection criteria of [20]. Muon candidates [21] are required to have pT > 10 GeV (and 20 GeV\nfor the same-sign 2-lepton analysis) and |\u03b7| < 2.4.\nThe measurement of the missing transverse momentum P~Tmiss and its magnitude, missing transverse energy\nmiss\nET\nis based on the transverse momenta of all electron and muon candidates, all jets which are not also\nelectron candidates, and all calorimeter clusters with |\u03b7| < 4.5 not associated to those objects. Since tau-lepton\ncandidates are not used in these analyses, the term \"lepton\" will refer only to electrons and muons.\nFollowing the steps above, overlaps between candidate jets with |\u03b7| < 2.8 and leptons\np are resolved using the\nmethod of [22] as follows. First, any jet candidates lying within a distance \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7)2 + (\u2206\u03c6)2 = 0.2 of\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\nFigure 2: Simplified models considered for the no-lepton channel, where gluinos and squarks directly decay down to the\nLSP in the gluino-gluino (left), gluino-squark (center), and squark-squark (right) processes.\n\nan electron are discarded, and then any electron or muon candidates remaining within a distance \u2206R = 0.4\nof any surviving jet candidate are discarded. Next, all jet candidates with |\u03b7| > 2.8 are discarded. Finally,\nthe remaining electron, muon and jet candidates are considered \"reconstructed\", and the term \"candidate\" is\ndropped.\n\n5. No-lepton Search\nmiss\nThe SUSY search with all-hadronic and ET\nsignature (so called \"No-lepton Mode\") is considered to be one\nof the \"golden channels.\" It has the largest coverage over possible phase space of R-parity conserving pMSSM\nmodels [11].\nIn this search, three simplified models are considered as shown in Figure 2, where gluinos and light-flavor\nsquarks are initially pair-produced. Direct decays to the lightest supersymmetric particles (LSPs) are considered,\nwhich are the simplest decays contributing to the no-lepton channel [5].\nFive signal regions are considered to cover various regions of the gluino-squark mass plane as shown in Table I.\nFirst of all, events are discarded if electrons and muons with pT > 20 GeV remain. In order to suppress detector\nnoise and non-collision background, events are required to have the primary vertex associated with at least five\nmiss\ntracks, and are discarded if any jets fail quality selection criteria described in [23]. Cuts on ET\nand the\nleading jet pT are applied to be on the efficiency plateau of the trigger requirement. Further selections on the\nsub-leading jets are considered to cover event topologies from q\u0303 q\u0303, g\u0303 q\u0303, and g\u0303g\u0303 processes, where the final states\nconsist of at least two, three, and four jets respectively. Effective mass (meff ) is defined as the scalar sum of\nmiss\nET\nand the pT of the two, three, four leading, or all the jets with pT > 40 GeV used for each signal region. It is\nknown to be approximately proportional to the mass of initially produced sparticles [24]. \u2206\u03c6(jet, P~Tmiss )min and\nmiss\nET\n/meff cuts are applied to suppress the QCD background. Two signal regions are considered for the four-jet\ncase using different requirements on meff to cover smaller and larger mass splittings between the sparticles.\nDominant sources of background from Standard Model processes are W+jets, Z+jets, top pair, multi-jet and\nsingle top production. Non-collision background is found to be negligible.\nIn order to estimate the backgrounds fully or partially in data-driven ways, five control regions (CRs) are\ndefined for each of the five signal regions (SRs), which are designed to provide uncorrelated data samples\nenriched with particular background sources. The observations in the CRs are used to estimate the background\nexpectations in the SRs by using transfer factors, which are the ratios of expected event counts in the CR\nand SR derived independently from the CR and SR themselves. The transfer factors are obtained from MC\nsimulations for the W+jets, Z+jets, top backgrounds, whereas for the multijet background, it is fully derived\nmiss\nfrom data by smearing jets in the low ET\nevents with jet response functions as is done in [25].\nFor the Z+jets background, irreducible contributions from Z(\u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304)+jets are dominant. Two CRs are considered that are enriched with \u03b3+jets and Z(\u2192 e+ e\u2212 , \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 )+jets, which have similar kinematics. The momentum\nmiss\nof the photon or the dilepton system from Z is added to the P~Tmiss to reproduce the ET\ndistribution of the\nZ(\u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304)+jets process.\nmiss\nThe W(\u2192 l\u03bd)+jets and top backgrounds are estimated\nfrom events containing one lepton and with ET\n>\nq\n\n130 GeV. Furthermore, the transverse mass MT =\n\n2plT p\u03bdT (1 \u2212 cos \u2206\u03c6(l, \u03bd)) is computed by assuming that the\n\n3\n\n\f4\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\nSignal Region\nmiss\nET\nLeading jet pT\n\nSecond jet pT\nThird jet pT\nFourth jet pT\n~Tmiss )min\n\u2206\u03c6(jet, P\nmiss\nET\n/meff\n\nmeff\n\n\u2265 2-jet \u2265 3-jet\n\n\u2265 4-jet\n\nHigh mass\n\n> 130\n> 130\n\n> 130\n> 130\n\n> 130\n> 130\n\n> 130\n> 130\n\n> 40\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n> 40\n> 40\n\u2013\n\n> 40\n> 40\n> 40\n\n> 80\n> 80\n> 80\n\n> 0.4\n> 0.4\n> 0.4\n> 0.3 > 0.25\n> 0.25\n> 1000 > 1000 > 500/1000\n\n> 0.4\n> 0.2\n> 1100\n\nTable I: Event selection for each of the five overlapping signal regions (meff , energy and momentum in GeV).

In each case the first (second)\nquoted uncertainty is statistical (systematic). Estimates of background components are partially correlated and hence\nthe uncertainties (statistical and systematic) on the total background estimates do not equal the quadrature sums of the\nuncertainties on the components.\n\nmiss\nmeasured ET\nprovides the neutrino information, and is required to be between 30 GeV and 100 GeV to select\nW and top events. The events are then separated into two CRs using the b-tagging information, where jets\narising from b-quarks are identified using the impact parameter and secondary vertex information. The lepton\nin the events is treated as a jet when computing the kinematic variables, since the dominant sources of W+jets\nand top backgrounds contain W's decaying into hadronic taus and tau-neutrinos.\nFinally, for the multijet background, the control region is chosen such that the cut on \u2206\u03c6(jet, P~Tmiss )min is\nreversed and tightened to \u2206\u03c6(jet, P~Tmiss )min < 0.2. In such events, P~Tmiss is aligned with jets in the transverse\nmiss\nplane, and ET\noriginates from the mismeasurement of jets or neutrino emission from heavy flavor decays\nwithin jets. An additional and separate CR was considered to estimate the impact of the dead region in the\nLAr EM barrel calorimeter.\nFor the transfer factors derived from the MC simulation, important sources of systematic uncertainties are\nthe jet energy scale, jet energy resolution, MC modeling uncertainties such as renormalization and factorization\nscale and parton distribution function (PDF) uncertainties, and uncertainty arising from the presence of pileup. Additional uncertainties originate from photon and lepton trigger and reconstruction efficiencies, photon\nand lepton energy scale and resolution (for estimating the W+jets, Z+jets, and top backgrounds), b-tag/veto\nefficiency (for W+jets and top), photon acceptance and background (for Z+jets), and MC statistics. For the\ndata-driven estimation of the multijet background, the main source of uncertainties for the transfer factor is\nthe modeling of the non-Gaussian tail of the jet response function.\nTable II shows the numbers of Standard Model background events expected in the signal regions, and the\nnumbers of observed events. The meff distributions are shown in Figure 3 for each signal region. No excess is\nobserved, and thus limits are obtained for each channel. The CLs prescription [26] is used to set the exclusions.\nFigure 4 shows the combined exclusion limits for the simplified models with mLSP = 0.\n\n\f106\n\nData 2011 ( s = 7 TeV)\nSM Total\nQCD multijet\nW+jets\nZ+jets\nt t and single top\nSM + SU(660,240,0,10)\n\n\u222bL dt = 1.04 fb\n\n-1\n\n105\n\nDijet Channel\n\n104\n103\n\nEntries / 100 GeV\n\nEntries / 100 GeV\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\nATLAS\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0\n\n105\n\n500\n\n\u222b\n\n104\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n3000\nmeff [GeV]\n\nData 2011 ( s = 7 TeV)\nSM Total\nQCD multijet\nW+jets\nZ+jets\nt t and single top\nSM + SU(660,240,0,10)\n\n-1\n\nL dt = 1.04 fb\n\nFour Jet Channel\n\n103\n\n500\n\n105\n\n\u222b\n\n104\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\nFour Jet High Mass\nChannel\n\n103\n\n2000\n\n2500\n3000\nmeff [GeV]\n\nData 2011 ( s = 7 TeV)\nSM Total\nQCD multijet\nW+jets\nZ+jets\nt t and single top\nSM + SU(660,240,0,10)\n\n-1\n\nL dt = 1.04 fb\n\n102\n\nATLAS\n\n102\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n0\n\nEntries / 150 GeV\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n\nDATA / MC\n\n1\nDATA / MC\n\nThree Jet Channel\n\n104\n\n2\n\n102\n\nEntries / 100 GeV\n\n-1\n\n103\n\nATLAS\n\nData 2011 ( s = 7 TeV)\nSM Total\nQCD multijet\nW+jets\nZ+jets\nt t and single top\nSM + SU(660,240,0,10)\n\n\u222bL dt = 1.04 fb\n\n105\n\nATLAS\n\n10\n10\n1\n1\n\n0\n\nDATA / MC\n\nDATA / MC\n\n10-1\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n3000\nmeff [GeV]\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n3000\nmeff [GeV]\n\n2000\n\n\u223c0) = 0 GeV\nSquark-gluino-neutralino model, m(\u03c7\n1\nATLAS\n0 lepton 2011 combined\n\nCLs observed 95% C.L. limit\n\n1750\n\nCLs median expected limit\nExpected limit \u00b11 \u03c3\n\n1500\n\n2010 data PCL 95% C.L. limit\n\n\u222b L dt = 1.04 fb ,\n-1\n\ns=7 TeV\n\n750\n\n\u03c3SUSY = 0.01 pb\n\nD0, Run II\n\n1000\n\nCDF, Run II\n\n1250\nTevatron, Run I\n\nsquark mass [GeV]\n\nFigure 3: The meff distributions for the dijet (top left), three jet (top right), four jet (bottom left), and four jet high\nmass (bottom right) channels.\n\n\u03c3SUSY = 0.1 pb\n\u03c3SUSY = 1 pb\n\n500\n\u03c3SUSY = 10 pb\n\n250\n0\n\nLEP2 ~\nq\n\n0\n\n250\n\n500\n\n750\n\n1000 1250\n\n1500 1750\n\n2000\n\ngluino mass [GeV]\n\nFigure 4: Combined exclusion limit for the simplified models with mLSP = 0.

Same-sign Dilepton Search\nA search in the same-sign dilepton channel is considered to be a clear channel for the supersymmetry search\ndue to very low expected background from the Standard Model [27].\nHere, simplified models are considered for the same-sign same-flavor squark pair production contributing\nto the signal region as shown in Figure 5 [28][29]. As such a process originates from the same flavor quark\ninteractions, the contributions from the third generation squarks can be disentangled [5]. For these simplified\n0\nmodels, there are three mass parameters: squark, weakino (\u03c7\u00b1\n1 , \u03c72 ), and the LSP. Branching ratios are also free\nparameters, and the ones relevant for the diagrams are mentioned below.\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n0 2\nBr(q\u0303 q\u0303 \u2192 qql\u00b1 \u03bdl\u00b1 \u03bd \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 ) = Br(q\u0303 \u2192 q \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 )Br(\u03c7\u03031 \u2192 l \u03bd \u03c7\u03031 )\n\n(1)\n\n\u00b1\n0\n0\n0\n+ \u2212 0\nBr(q\u0303 q\u0303 \u2192 qql\u03bdl+ l\u2212 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 ) = 2Br(q\u0303 \u2192 q \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 )Br(q\u0303 \u2192 q \u03c7\u03032 )Br(\u03c7\u03031 \u2192 l\u03bd \u03c7\u03031 )Br(\u03c7\u03032 \u2192 l l \u03c7\u03031 )\n\n(2)\n\nFor this channel, events are required to have at least one reconstructed primary vertex with at least five\nassociated tracks. Furthermore, the distance between the z coordinate of the primary vertex and that of the\nextrapolated muon track at the point closest to the primary vertex must be less than 10 mm to suppress cosmic\nbackground. The signal region is defined as events with exactly two identified same-sign leptons (electrons and\nmiss\nmuons) with pT > 20 GeV and ET\n> 100 GeV.\nBackgrounds from several Standard Model processes could contaminate the signal regions. The main background to the same-sign dilepton final state arises from W +jets and QCD multijet production, where one or\nmore jets are misidentified as isolated leptons, which is referred to as \"fake lepton\" background. The other\nsignificant backgrounds arise from charge misidentification of an electron due to a hard bremsstrahlung process\nmiss\nin the tt\u0304 process. Contributions from Z+jets are negligible due to a high ET\ncut. Contributions from the\ndiboson production are also estimated. The fake background is estimated in a data-driven way using the matrix method [15], and MC-based estimations are used for the other backgrounds. The cosmic background was\nconsidered and found to be negligible.\nThe systematic uncertainties on the data-driven fake background estimates mainly come from the parametrization of the fake rate. For the MC-driven background estimates, the jet energy scale and resolution, lepton energy\nscale, resolution and identification, luminosity, cross section, and parton distribution function (PDF) uncertainties are considered. More details are mentioned in [15].\nNo excess above the Standard Model prediction is observed as shown in Figure 6 and Table III, and upper\nlimits on the cross-section times branching ratios for new physics based on the simplified models are obtained [29].\nClassical confidence intervals in the theoretical cross section are constructed by generating ensembles of pseudoexperiments that describe the expected fluctuations of statistical and systematic uncertainties on both signal and\nbackgrounds, following the likelihood ratio ordering prescription proposed by Feldman and Cousins [30]. The\nPDF uncertainty for the signals is estimated in the same way as the SM background, adopting a conservative\nuncertainty of 5.5%.\n\n\fEntries / 10 GeV\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n102\n\n\u222b L dt ~ 35 pb\n\n-1\n\nATLAS\n\nData 2010 ( s = 7 TeV)\nStandard Model\nZ/\u03b3 +jets, WW, WZ, ZZ\n\nSame Sign\n\ntt, t\nDijets\n\n10\n\nW+jets\nWbb\nSU4+SM\n\n1\n\n10-1\n\nData/MC\n\n10-2\n\n4\n2\n00\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\nEmiss\n[GeV]\nT\n\nmiss\nFigure 6: Distribution of ET\nin the same-sign dilepton channel.\n\nTable III: Summary of the background yields and observed number of events for the same sign dilepton channels.\ne\u00b1 e\u00b1\ne\u00b1 \u03bc\u00b1\n\u03bc\u00b1 \u03bc\u00b1\nFakes\n0.12 \u00b1 0.13 0.030 \u00b1 0.026 0.014 \u00b1 0.010\nDi-bosons\n0.015 \u00b1 0.008 0.035 \u00b1 0.014 0.021 \u00b1 0.006\nCharge misidentification 0.019 \u00b1 0.008 0.026 \u00b1 0.011\nCosmics\n0+1.17\n\u22120\n+1.17\n0.04 \u00b1 0.01\nTotal\n0.15 \u00b1 0.13\n0.09\u22120.03\nData\n0\n0\n0\n\nFigure 7 shows 95% confidence level (CL) observed upper limits for each diagram as a function of mq\u0303 and\nm\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 ,\u03c7\u03030 for the fixed LSP mass of 50 GeV. Each figure corresponds to a specific diagram, where the branching\n1\n2\nratios are explicitly described in (1)-(2). Corresponding limit plots for the fixed LSP masses of 100 and 200\nGeV, and for the diagram from a four-lepton final state are described in [29].\nFor each diagram, a grid of 26 signal points is produced and used for the limit setting. The upper limits\nare interpolated linearly from those points in three coordinates. The impact of the interpolation on the signal\nacceptance is found to be below a few percent and therefore does not impact the results.\n\n7. Conclusions\nNo excess is found in the no-lepton channel with 1.04 fb\u22121 of data from 2011, and in the same-sign dilepton\nchannel using 2010 data of 35 pb\u22121 . The results are interpreted with simplified models. They allow to scan wide\nrange of sparticle mass planes, and to understand which phase space is currently covered. The simplified model\napproach provides model-independent interpretations and will also serve as an interface to map the results to\nspecific models even beyond SUSY models. Interplay between different search channels is gaining more interest\nand importance. More simplified model results are currently under investigation.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank NSF and the DPF 2011 organizing committee for the partial financial support.\n\n7\n\n\f8\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1 0 0\nFigure 7: Observed upper limits (95% CL) on \u03c3\u00d7 Br in pb for the q\u0303 q\u0303 \u2192 q \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 q \u03c7\u03031 \u2192 qqW W \u03c7\u03031 \u03c7\u03031 process (left) and\n\u00b1\n0\n\u00b1\n0 0\nq\u0303 q\u0303 \u2192 q \u03c7\u03031 q \u03c7\u03032 \u2192 qqW Z \u03c7\u03031 \u03c7\u03031 (right) as a function of mq\u0303 and m\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 ,\u03c7\u03030 for the fixed LSP mass of 50 GeV.\n1\n\n2\n\nReferences\n1 ATLAS Collaboration, JINST 3 (2008) S08003.\n2 L.
