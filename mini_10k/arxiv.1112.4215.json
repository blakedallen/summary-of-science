Large TES arrays are expected to bring forth similar advances in other\nobservational bands such as the sub-mm (e.g., [6]), Xray (e.g., [7]), and gamma-ray (e.g., [8\u201310]) as well as\n\nphonon detection in dark matter direct detection experiments (e.g., [11]).\nTES detectors in the millimeter to far-IR range are\napproaching the photon statistics limit, meaning their\nnoise performance is dominated by fluctuations in the\narrival rate of photons at the detector, and not by the\nintrinsic noise performance of the detectors themselves.\nConsequently, higher mapping speed can best be realized by increasing the number of detectors, rather than\nby improving the detectors themselves. A key challenge\nin building focal planes with large sensor counts has been\n\n\f2\nmultiplexing the signals between the cold sub-kelvin operating temperature of the detectors and room temperature electronics. Multiplexing minimizes the heat-load\non the detector cold stage and reduces the complexity of\nthe cold wiring.\nTwo complementary multiplexing strategies are commonly used: (1) time domain multiplexing (TDM) [12\u2013\n15], where the detectors are read out sequentially one at\na time with a revisit rate that is faster than the detector time constant, and (2) frequency-domain multiplexing (fMUX) where each detector is biased at a unique\nlocation in frequency space and read out continuously.\nWhile the TDM system was developed earlier, both technologies are now quite mature. An eight-channel TDM\nproof-of-concept system was first to make sky observations [16].\nA new TES readout scheme that multiplexes signals from GHz frequency RF SQUIDs [17, 18]\nis in the early stages of development, as is a new codedomain multiplexing readout [19].\nIn this paper, we describe the fMUX readout system\n[20\u201327] as it has been deployed for mm-wavelength observations with the APEX-SZ [2, 28, 29] and South Pole\nTelescope (SPT) SZ [4, 30] receivers.\nThese experiments are designed for high angular resolution observations of the CMB. For example, the unique combination\nof sensitivity and resolution of these instruments makes\nit possible to study the structure and evolution of galaxy\nclusters using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect [31], a\nsmall distortion imprinted on the CMB when primordial photons inverse-Compton scatter off hot electrons in\nthe intra-cluster medium.\nThe resolved SZ image of\nthe Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56) obtained with APEXSZ [32] was the first published scientific result with a\nlarge array of multiplexed TES detectors. SPT achieved\nthe first SZ detections of previously unknown galaxy clusters [33] with its array of multiplexed TES detectors. A\nwealth of new measurements have been presented by both\nSPT [34\u201346] and APEX-SZ [47\u201349].\nOther implementations of frequency multiplexed TES\nreadout systems are described in Refs. [50, 51].\nThis paper is outlined as follows. In \u00a7II, a brief\noverview of the system, its advantages, and the performance requirements is presented. A detailed description of the sub-kelvin components of the system is provided in \u00a7III. This description is accompanied by a summary of the design process for specifying the basic multiplexer parameters, such as channel spacing. \u00a7IV details\nthe SQUID pre-amplifier and back-end electronics. The\nperformance for the system operating in the SPT and\nAPEX-SZ experiments is described in \u00a7V, and conclusions are presented in \u00a7VI.\n\nII.\n\nGENERAL OVERVIEW\n\nThe fMUX readout system operates in concert with an\narray of TES detectors. Each bolometric detector has a\nmetal absorber and TES, which are coupled by a weak\n\nthermal link to a \u223c 0.25 K thermal bath. A constantamplitude sinusoidal voltage bias is applied to the TES,\nwhich is a superconducting film with a transition temperature of about 0.5 K. The combination of radiation\npower absorbed from the sky and electrical bias power\nraises the temperature of the TES mid-way into its superconducting transition.\nAn increase in sky power\nincident on the absorber alters the TES resistance and\n(through negative electro-thermal feedback, see \u00a7III A),\nproduces a decrease in the electrical power being dissipated in the sensor. This, in turn, produces a change in\nthe current through the sensor, since the applied voltage\nis held constant. TES thermometers are chosen because\ntheir steep transition allows for linearity, their monolithic\nwafer-scale fabrication yields large arrays, and because\ntheir low impedance makes them compatible with multiplexing. The properties and parameters of the bolometer\narrays dictate the design requirements for the readout\nsystem.\n\nA.\n\nThe APEX-SZ and SPT Experiments\n\nThe SPT focal plane [52, 55] is divided into three\nseparate bands centered at approximately 95, 150, and\n220 GHz, with bandwidths of about 40 GHz. The APEXSZ detectors operate at 150 GHz with \u223c36 GHz bandwidth. Coherent amplification devices such as High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) are ultimately limited by quantum noise, and incoherent detection with\nbolometers can offer higher sensitivity at these frequencies.\nBoth experiments use a closed-cycle refrigerator manufactured by Chase Research Cryogenics (140 Manchester\nRoad, Sheffield, UK S10 5DL), with two 3 He sorption\nstages and one 4 He sorption stage, to cool the bolometers\nand sub-kelvin multiplexer components to their \u223c0.25 K\nbath temperature. The refrigerator is thermally coupled\nto the \u223c4 K stage of a Cryomech (113 Falso Drive, Syracuse, USA 13211) model PT 410 mechanical pulse tube\ncooler. With this combination, the system is cooled without the use of any expendable cryogens, greatly simplifying the operation of these instruments in the remote\nenvironments of the Chilean Atacama plateau and the\ngeographic South Pole for APEX-SZ and SPT respectively.\nAPEX-SZ and SPT have 0.4\u25e6 and 1\u25e6 fields of views\n(FoVs) respectively, and both experiments have full\nwidth half maximum (FWHM) beam sizes of about 1 arcminute. There are no \"chopper mirrors\" in the optical systems to modulate the beams across the sky; instead the telescopes are scanned at typical speeds of 0.250.5\u25e6 /second. Since we are interested in observing astronomical structures (such as primary CMB fluctuations)\nat scales occupying a large fraction of the FoV, these\nexperimental parameters and scan strategy dictate that\ninformation will appear in the detector timestreams at\n<\nfrequencies as low as \u223c 1 Hz.\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: Layout of the frequency-domain multiplexed readout\nfor a module of N TES detectors.\n\nB.\n\nReadout System Concept\n\nThe detector readout is segregated into identical fMUX\nmodules, each biasing and reading out N TES detectors\non a single pair of wires. The basic layout of one multiplexer module of the fMUX system is shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 2 shows the system electronics (\u00a7 IV) in greater detail. To set its specific bias frequency, each TES bolometer (Rbolo ) is connected through a series-resonant circuit\nformed by an inductor (L) and capacitor (C) on the subkelvin stage. The inductance is the same for all channels, defining the same Rbolo /(2\u03c0L) electrical bandwidth\nfor each detector.\nThus, changing the capacitance\nalone sets the LCRbolo channel resonant frequency. A\nbank of N fixed amplitude sine-wave generators operating at room temperature provides a 'comb' of detector\nvoltage bias carriers, each operating at a frequency tuned\nto match the resonance of the individual LCRbolo channels. Sky signals modulate the TES resistance, amplitude modulating the current of the carrier. This encodes\nthe sky-signal in symmetrical sidebands above and below\nthe carrier.\nSince the signal currents from the individual TES detectors are at different frequencies, they\ncan all be summed together and transmitted to a single low-impedance input amplifier operating at 4 K. We\nemploy a series array SQUID operating in a flux-locked\nloop (FLL) for this transimpedance amplification stage.\nTo reduce the SQUID dynamic range requirements, an\ninverted version of the carrier comb, referred to as the\n'nulling comb', is injected at the SQUID input to cancel\nthe carriers (see \u00a7IV). The comb of amplitude modulated\ncarriers is transmitted from the SQUID output to a bank\nof room temperature demodulators. There is separate\nanalog demodulator for each TES that mixes the detector\nsignal down to baseband. A low-pass anti-aliasing filter is\napplied to the resultant timestream before it is digitized.\nThe signal amplitude is proportional to the photon power\n\ndeposited on the TES photon absorber. The APEX-SZ\nand SPT systems are configured with N = 7 detectors\nper readout module.\nThe configuration shown in Figure 1 uses current summing at the low impedance input of the transimpedance\namplifier using a SQUID input stage. The fMUX can\nalso be implemented by introducing a transformer in series with each bolometer, and summing the voltages from\nthe transformer secondaries [21], but since a TES biased\nby a constant voltage yields changes in signal current, the\ncurrent summing configuration is more direct. The design requirements, challenges, and implications are similar for both configurations. For simplicity, we focus only\non the current summing strategy.\nThe fMUX readout architecture has the following key\nfeatures:\n(1) Simplicity of cryogenic components: the sub-kelvin\ncomponents consist of one capacitor and one superconducting inductor per bolometer, followed by a single\nSQUID pre-amplifier per readout module at 4K. Since\nthe SQUIDs are located far from the detectors, they can\nbe magnetically shielded in a straightforward manner.\nThe only custom sub-kelvin components are the inductors, which can be manufactured via a simple, low cost\nprocess with high yield.\n(2) Low wire count per detector and independent modules. The fMUX requires just two wires per readout module for both bias and readout. Each module is completely\nindependent so that wiring failures or other defects in one\nmodule do not affect others.\n(3) Signals are modulated at high (typically MHz) frequencies, well above microphonic pickup frequencies and\namplifier low-frequency noise.\nThe inductor-capacitor\nfilters in series with the detectors suppress currents at\nfrequencies outside the narrow LCRbolo bandwidth of\nthe individual bolometer legs. This reduces crosstalk,\neliminates the dominant source of microphonics usually\npresent in bolometer systems, and results in a high rejection of electromagnetic interference that comes from numerous sources such as scan-correlated changes in magnetic field.\n(4) The readout system dissipates zero power on the detector cold stage as there are no resistive or active elements.\n(5) Channels are read out continuously with no switching\ntransients that limit the detector bandwidth. This makes\nthe system easily applicable to higher bandwidth application such as photon counting X-ray microcalorimeters.\n(6) The voltage bias can be set to optimize the sensitivity of each individual detector. This allows the readout system to compensate for detector fabrication nonuniformity.\nPractical challenges for implementing the fMUX system include: achieving the large dynamic range needed to\naccommodate the bias carriers; meeting the strict stability requirements on the bias generators needed to avoid\nintroducing low frequency noise; managing non-idealities\nin cryogenic wiring that can introduce stray inductances\n\n\f4\nCOLD ELECTRONICS\n\nROOM TEMPERATURE ELECTRONICS\nSQUID\nCONTROLLER\n\nMULTIPLEXER CIRCUITRY\nCHANNEL 1\nCHANNEL n\nL\n\nL\n\nL\n\nSUMMED BIAS CARRIERS\n\nL\n\nC1\n\nC2\n\nC3\n\nCn\n\nRbolo\n\nRbolo\n\nRbolo\n\nRbolo\n\nOSCILLATOR - DEMODULATOR BOARD\n\nRbias\n\nCHANNEL n\n\nCHANNEL 1\n+V\nV\n\n0.25 K STAGE\nIbolo\n\n+V\n\nDDS\nOSC\n\nV\n\nDDS\nOSC\n\nSUMMED NULLING CARRIERS\nDEMOD\n\nLPF\n\nADC\n\nDEMOD\n\nLPF\n\nADC\n\n4 K STAGE\nDDS CONTROL\nFPGA: CONTROL AND READOUT\n\nSQUID INPUT\nAMPLIFIER\n\nSAMPLING\nSTROBE\n\nCONTROL\nDATA\nTO / FROM ONLINE COMPUTER\n\nFIG. 2: Block diagram showing the basic topology of the fMUX readout system implementation, with an emphasis on the\nroom temperature electronics.

The readout system receives noise contributions from its SQUID and\nroom-temperature electronics amplifier stages, Johnson\nnoise from the TES resistance, and Johnson noise leakage through the LCRbolo filter from neighboring detector\nchannels.\nDetector Stability: The analog circuit that includes the\nTES must be stable across the full range of observation\nconditions.\nCross-talk:\nTypical detector-to-detector cross-talk for\nour systems due to beam side-lobes and radiation leakage in the bolometer integration cavity is \u223c 1%. The\nreadout system electrical cross-talk should be small in\n\ncomparison.\nDynamic Range: The readout system amplification needs\nto have sufficient dynamic range to accommodate the\nlarge bias carriers without introducing significant intermodulation distortion. The dynamic range requirement\nis substantially reduced for the fMUX system by canceling the carriers at the SQUID input with nulling signals\nthat are inverted versions of the raw bias carriers, described in \u00a7IV.\nBandwidth and Post-Detection Sampling Rate: The telescope scan strategy defines a low frequency stability requirement of better than \u223c1 Hz which places stringent\nstability requirements on the sideband noise of the bias\ncarriers. The fastest expected thermalization time constant of the detector absorber, \u03c4web '5 ms (often referred\nto as the \"optical time constant\"), defines 30 Hz as the\nupper end of the signal band. Note that much higher\nbandwidths are of interest for characterizing bolometers,\neff\nsince the response time of the TES thermistor \u03c4TES\ncan\nbe much faster than the bolometer optical time constant. This motivates a sampling rate in the range of\n100-1000 Hz. Refer to Table I for definitions of the time\nconstants used in this paper and Ref. [53] for a detailed\nthermal description of the detectors, including time response and diagrams.\nProgrammability: The system needs to operate autonomously under computer control, tuning and setting\nup each SQUID and detector. This tuning needs to be\ndynamic, so that changes in operating conditions (such as\nsmall changes in cryogenic temperatures or large changes\n\n\f5\n\u03c4web thermalization time constant of the detector radiation\nabsorber\neff\n\u03c4TES\neffective TES response time for thermal signals\n\u03c4LCR electrical time constant of the notch filter formed by the\nbolometer resistance and multiplexer inductor/capacitor\nTABLE I: Definitions for the time constants utilized in this\npaper.\n\nin atmospheric loading) do not adversely affect the system yield or operation.\nDiagnostics: The system must provide sufficient diagnostic information so as to characterize detector performance, recognize problems such as failed tunings, and\nprovide feedback to the telescope operator.\n\nIII.\n\nSUB-KELVIN MULTIPLEXER\n\nOne of the advantages for the fMUX system is the simplicity of the sub-kelvin readout components, consisting\nonly of capacitors, inductors, and wiring. However, as\ndiscussed in this section, successful implementation of an\nfMUX system requires careful management of stray reactances to maintain good detector stability and optimal\nsystem noise. In addition to describing the specific implementations of the sub-kelvin multiplexer components\nfor APEX-SZ and SPT in this section, after first describing the TES bolometers, we outline the design process\nthat leads to the choice of parameters.\n\nA.\n\nTES Bolometer Arrays\n\nThe APEX-SZ and SPT TES bolometer arrays (Figure 3,) were fabricated at UC Berkeley [54\u201356]. The\ndetector arrays consist of six triangular shaped wedges,\nwhich together form a hexagonal array of 330 and 966\nbolometers respectively for APEX-SZ and SPT. Short\nsections of circular wave-guide with conical feed-horns\ndefine the lower edge of the detector band and couple the\ndetectors to free space. Metal mesh filters [57, 58] located\nabove the feed-horns define the upper band edge. The\nbolometers are electrically connected to the cold multiplexer components with aluminum wire bonds on the\nperiphery of the bolometer array.\nThe bolometers each consist of a 3 mm diameter gold\nabsorber suspended above the 0.26 K cold stage bath\nthrough a thermal conductance in the range of \u1e20=100200 pW/K, where the bar indicates G is averaged across\nthe temperature difference between the TES transition\ntemperature and its thermal bath. The bolometer operates with total power Ptotal = \u1e20(Tbolo \u2212 Tbath ) flowing to the bath. Optimizing G is a trade-off between\n(1) lower noise, which pushes G to lower values, and (2)\nhigh dynamic range for observations at a variety of optical loading conditions, which pushes G to higher values. For APEX-SZ and SPT, the target G has been\n\nFIG. 3: Photograph showing one wedge of 161 SPT TES\nbolometers. The bolometer wedge is wire-bonded to a circuit\nboard on which the multiplexer inductors and capacitors are\nmounted. An integrated flexible microstrip (visible at the\nright of the photo) brings the leads to connectors mounted\nbelow the circuit board. The band-defining feed-horns and\nmetal mesh filters have been removed for this photo.\n\nchosen so that the detector saturation power is slightly\nlarger than twice the typical incident radiation power,\nPtotal & 2 Prad , which maintains high electro-thermal\nloop-gain (discussed below) under all observing conditions.\nThe bolometer absorber has a spiderweb geometry,\nwhich provides a high optical efficiency while minimizing\nthe cross section to cosmic rays. An Al/Ti bilayer TES is\nlocated at the center of each spiderweb and tuned to a superconducting transition temperature Tbolo \u223c 0.55 K and\nnormal resistance Rnormal \u223c 1.2 \u03a9. The thermalization\ntime of the spiderweb \u03c4web , typically 10-15 ms (16-11 Hz)\nfor our detectors, sets the device's response time for opeff\nto\ntical signals.\nThe TES has a response time \u03c4TES\nthermal signals that is sped up by electro-thermal feedback and is typically more than an order of magnitude\neff\nfaster than \u03c4web .\nSince a fast \u03c4TES\nplaces additional\nconstraints on the readout system (see \u00a7III A 2), the TES\ntime constant is slowed down by attaching a gold feature\nwith considerable heat capacity [53]. Typical optical efficiencies (for the conversion of power from astronomical\nradiation to electrical power) are \u223c80% for light incident\non the detectors, and about 20-40% end-to-end from the\ntelescope's primary dish. References [2] and [52] provide\ndiscussions of the APEX-SZ and SPT optical efficiences\nrespectively.\n\n1.\n\nDetector Bias and Electro-Thermal Feedback\n\nThe TES are biased with a fixed amplitude sinusoidal\nvoltage at frequencies much higher (faster) than the TES\ncan respond, so it sees the integrated bias power. The\n\n\f6\nsteep \u2206Rbolo /\u2206T TES transition and voltage bias provide the conditions for strong negative electro-thermal\nfeedback (ETF) [59]. When the radiation power Prad\nincident on the bolometer increases, the bolometer temperature Tbolo increases, driving up its resistance Rbolo .\nThis, in turn, brings down the electrical bias power\n\u03c9i\n2\nPelec\n= Vbias\n/Rbolo provided by the sinusoid at frequency\n\u03c9 i , completing the negative ETF loop.\nETF improves linearity, extends the dynamic range,\nand speeds up the effective TES response time for thermal signals.\nA measure of the ETF strength is the\nloop-gain,\n\ni\n\nLi =\n\n\u03c9\n\u03b1Pelec\n,\nGTbolo\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = d log(Rbolo )/d log(Tbolo ) is the logarithmic\nderivative of the bolometer resistance Rbolo with temperature Tbolo ,\nG = dPtotal /dTbolo is the instantaneous thermal conductance between the bolometer absorber and bath, and Tbolo is the TES transition temperature. When the loop-gain is high, the total power on\n\u03c9i\nthe bolometer Ptotal = Prad + Pelec\nwill be approximately\nconstant and balanced by the rate of heat transmitted to\nR Tbolo\nthe bath, Ptotal = \u1e20(Tbolo \u2212 Tbath ) = Tbath\nGdT .\nOne simple strategy for providing voltage bias is to\nplace the TES in a loop with a small bias resistor,\nRbias << Rbolo shown in Figure 1, across which the\nvoltage bias is provided by an external current source.\nThis loop consists of the bias resistor, one bolometer, the\ninductor and capacitor that define the loop resonant frequency, and the transimpedance amplifier input. Ideally,\nall other components in the loop would have negligible\nimpedance in comparison with the bolometer.\nThis\nincludes the transimpedance amplifier that measures the\nTES current, wiring, and any other components such as\nthe inductors and capacitors that define the resonant frequency.\nThe wiring that connects the bolometers\non the sub-kelvin stage to the low impedance ammeter\n(in this implementation, a SQUID array located on a\n4 K stage) can be substantial in length and span large\ntemperature gradients. Wiring resistance can be kept\nlow while maintaining low thermal-conductivity by constructing the wires from a superconductor, such as NbTi.\nSince this wiring lies outside the tuned LCRbolo leg of the\nloop, its inductance L can not be tuned out by the fMUX\ncapacitor for more than one channel. This means it is\nnecessary to keep the wiring inductance low enough that\nthe reactance is small compared to Rbolo at the resonant\nfrequency. Meeting this requirement is difficult with traditional twisted pair wiring (50 nH amounts to 0.3j \u03a9 at\n1 MHz, where j denotes the imaginary component), so\nthat low inductance microstrips are necessary for all or\npart of this wiring (see \u00a7IV D).\n\n2.\n\nBandwidth and Detector Stability\n\nTo avoid under-damped or exponentially growing oscillations in the TES response, the electrical power (halfwidth at half maximum, HWHM) bandwidth of the\nLCRbolo filter 1/\u03c4LCR must exceed the TES thermal\neff\neff\nbandwidth 1/\u03c4TES\nby a factor 1/\u03c4LCR \u2265 5.8/\u03c4TES\n[60]\n(see Ref. [61] for a thorough description).\nFor the\nAPEX-SZ and SPT detectors with Rbolo ' 1 \u03a9 and\nthermalisation time constant \u03c4web \u2265 5 ms (32 Hz rolloff frequency), we employ 15.8 \u03bcH inductors to maximize the detector readout bandwidth while still meeting\nour constraint on cross-channel current leakage. This reeff\nsults in the requirement \u03c4TES\n> 0.2 ms (0.8 kHz roll-off\nfrequency). This allows for an order of magnitude range\neff\n(0.2 ms < \u03c4TES\n< 5 ms) for the TES time constant. The\nTES time constants are increased to lie within this range\nby adding a heat capacity in the form of an Au island\nthat has a strong thermal coupling to the TES. Howeff\nis sped up by the loop-gain of the\never, since the \u03c4TES\nETF, it is important to have a substantial stability range.\nThis stability requirement defines the minimum allowed\nLCRbolo bandwidth, and hence the channel spacing (described below) for the fMUX system.\n\nB.\n\nMultiplexer Channel Spacing\n\nThe spacing between adjacent multiplexer channels is\nchosen such that (1) Johnson noise leakage from adjacent\nchannels is small, (2) bias current leakage from adjacent\nchannels does not spoil the detector voltage bias, and\n(3) cross-talk between neighboring detectors on a comb\nis small in comparison to the other sources of cross-talk\nin the experiment. These conditions must hold for the\nLCRbolo bandwidth that is defined by the ETF stability\nrequirements discussed in \u00a7III A 2. For APEX-SZ and\nSPT a channel spacing of 75 kHz is used. The first two\ncriteria are discussed below, while cross-talk is discussed\nin \u00a7III C.\nEach bolometer in the multiplexer module is a source of\nbroadband Johnson noise. The SQUID input receives the\nsum of all Johnson noise contributions from every channel, so it is necessary to space the channels far enough\napart in frequency so that the Johnson noise from neighboring channels is attenuated to a negligible level. This\nrequirement is not the dominant constraint for channel\nspacing. At a frequency of 75 kHz away from resonance,\nfor L = 15.8 \u03bcH and Rbolo = 1 \u03a9, the Johnson noise\ncurrent of a detector is attenuated by a factor 15, providing an increase of just 0.2% to the total Johnson current noise of its neighbor. The increase in total detector\nnoise is substantially smaller than this when other noise\nsources are also considered. The Johnson noise leakage\nfrom spacings as close as 4 times the LCRbolo bandwidth\n(20 kHz, in this case) or less could be tolerated, contributing a 3% increase in the Johnson noise current of a\nneighbor.\n\n\f7\nA more serious constraint on channel spacing is bias\ncurrent leakage. In addition to its own on-resonance\nbias, bolometer channel i also sees a fraction of the current from the i \u00b1 1 nearest carriers that neighbor in frequency space. The magnitude ratio of the off-resonance\n\u03c9\ncurrent IChi\u00b11\ni from the neighboring carrier bias to the on\u03c9i\nresonance current ICh\ni flowing through bolometer channel i is\n\u03c9\n\nIChi\u00b11\nRbolo\ni\n=q\n\u03c9i\nICh\n2\ni\nRbolo + (\u03c9i\u00b11 L \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\u03c9i\u00b11 CCh i )\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Rbolo is the bolometer resistance, L is the series inductor, CCh i is the series capacitor, and \u03c9i\u00b11 is the angular frequency of the adjacent bias carrier. For the channel\nspacing and parameters considered here, this may be ap\u03c9\n\u03c9i\nRbolo\nproximated IChi\u00b11\ni /ICh i \u2248 2\u2206\u03c9L , where \u2206\u03c9 is the channel\nspacing.\nBias carrier leakage can be problematic, mostly because of cross-talk (discussed below), but also because\nthe leakage is a quasi-current bias that provides a positive ETF contribution to the total bias power seen by\nthe bolometer. While the negative ETF afforded by the\non-resonance voltage bias will dominate, the contribution from carrier leakage can cause instability and will\nalso enhance the bolometer responsivity slightly.\nAll of these effects are rather small in practice. For a\nspacing of 50 kHz (10 times the LCRbolo bandwidth), the\nelectrical bias power from one of the nearest neighbors\nis roughly 1% of the on-resonance power assuming that\nall bolometers are biased at the same voltage amplitude.\nFor channels biased near the center of the bias-frequency\ncomb, the total off-resonance bias power is approximately\n3%. This leads to a 3% increase in both the responsitivity\nand the effective time constant, and a 3% decrease in the\nmaximum loopgain. At our spacing of 75 kHz (15 times\nthe LCRbolo bandwidth), these effects are reduced to 1%.\nC.\n\nCross-talk\n\nThe multiplexer contributes channel-to-channel crosstalk due to (1) inductor cross-coupling, (2) bias carrier\nleakage, and (3) signals from a detector causing heating in neighbor detectors due to the voltage drop across\nnon-zero SQUID or wiring impedance. Contributions\nfrom these mechanisms, discussed below, are smaller than\nthe \u223c1% optical cross-talk that typically exists between\nneighboring pixels for APEX-SZ and SPT.\n(1) Inductor cross-coupling: The mutual inductance\nMi,j = ki,j Li Lj between inductors Li and Lj of two\nchannels i and j in a multiplexer module creates crosstalk. The carrier current Ii flowing through the ith\nbolometer channel induces a voltage |Vj | = \u03c9i Mi,j Ii in\nthe inductor j that physically neighbors channel i. As\ni\nRbolo\nchanges in response to sky signals, the voltage Vj\nis modulated as well. This modulation produces small\nj\nchanges in the current flowing in channel j since Rbolo\n\nj\nforms a small fraction of the total LCRbolo\nimpedance\nat frequencies far from its resonance. The measured coupling coefficient [25] between neighboring inductors on\nthe same chip is k = 0.010 \u00b1 0.002 for the fMUX system.\nThis form of cross-talk can be made negligible by ensuring that channels with physically neighboring inductors\nare not neighbors in frequency space (i.e., that physically\nneighboring inductors in this implementation have carrier\nbias frequencies separated by more than 150 kHz).\n(2) Bias carrier leakage: As Rbolo changes in response\nto sky signals incident on bolometer i, both its onresonance carrier at frequency \u03c9i and the off-resonance\nleakage bias carriers at neighboring frequencies \u03c9i\u00b11 are\nmodulated, creating cross-talk. This mechanism encodes\na cross-talk sky-signal on the leakage current waveform.\nThe signal appears as an amplitude modulation in the\non-resonance carrier, but leads to modulation in both\nthe amplitude and the phase of the off-resonance carrier.\nThus a full quadrature demodulator would see cross talk\nsignal in both the I- and Q-components of the demodulator output. However, the demodulator measures only the\nI-component modulations. For an off-resonance LCRbolo\nchannel i \u00b1 1 at carrier frequency \u03c9i , the amplitude fluctuation is:\n\u03c9i\nICh\ni\u00b11\n\n\u03c9i\nVbias\nRbolo + j\u03c9i L + 1/(j\u03c9i CCh i\u00b11 )\n\u03c9i\nVbias\n'\nRbolo + j2\u2206\u03c9 L\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c9i\nVbias\njRbolo\n1+\n,\n'\nj2\u2206\u03c9 L\n2\u2206\u03c9 L\n\n=\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhere a first-order Taylor expansion in the parameter\njRbolo\n2\u2206\u03c9 L has been performed for the last equality. This results in a current modulation with a change in bolometer\nresistance of\n\u03c9i\n\u03c9i\n\u2206ICh\nVbias\ni\u00b11\n,\n'\n\u2206Rbolo\n(2\u2206\u03c9 L)2\n\n(6)\n\nwhich should be compared to the current modulation\n\u03c9i\n\u2206ICh\n\u2212V \u03c9i\ni\n' 2bias\n\u2206Rbolo\nRbolo\n\n(7)\n\nthat would occur on-resonance. The magnitude ratio of\nEquation 6 to Equation 7\n2\nRbolo\n(2\u2206\u03c9 L)2\n\n(8)\n\nis a good approximation for this cross-talk. This is\nequivalent to the square of the current leakage ratio\npresented in Equation 2. For our circuit parameters\n(Rbolo = 0.75 \u03a9, \u2206\u03c9 = 2\u03c0 * 75 kHz, L = 15.8 \u03bcH), this\neffect results in \u223c0.25% cross-talk. Note that this is\nlarger than the cross-talk estimate that was derived\nin Ref. [25], which did not correctly take into account\nthe phase of this cross-talk signal.\n\n\f8\n(3) Non-zero SQUID/wiring impedance: A change in\nbolometer impedance of channel i in response to skysignals, causes the voltage at carrier frequency \u03c9i across\nthe stray SQUID and wiring reactance to be modulated, which in turn causes a modulation in the leakage\ncurrent power deposited in neighboring detectors i \u00b1 1.\nThis mechanism transmits cross-talk power from the onresonance detector to the off-resonance neighbors, which\nis the opposite transfer direction compared to mechanism (2). The voltage Vmodule across the sub-kelvin multiplexer module (measured from the right side of p1 to\nthe right side of p2 in Figure 4) is not exactly equal to\nthe voltage Vbias across the bias resistor. This discrepancy arises from the non-zero complex input impedance\nof the SQUID system (p5 in Figure 4) and the stray inductance of the wiring (p1 and p2 in Figure 4) that connects the module to the SQUID input (together labelled\nVstray ) such that Vmodule = Vbias \u2212 Vstray . For the purposes of this discussion, the p3 and p4 stray components\n\u03c9i\nin Figure 4 can be ignored.

Capacitive coupling of wires within\nmulti-wire cables that carry signals from different detector channels is typically \u223c1% for bundles of twisted pairs.\nFor a non-multiplexed system, all detector signals normally occupy the same frequency bandwidth as they are\ntransmitted through these cables, resulting in 1% cross\ntalk with neighbors. For the fMUX system, each wire\ncarries a module of detectors, each at a unique bias frequency. Since the \u223c100 Hz signal bandwidth is a small\nfraction of the total bandwidth, the bias frequencies of\nmodules that are bundled together can be chosen to be\nunique. This places the cable cross-talk signals in a portion of the bandwidth that is discarded by the signal demodulation. This means that, overall, this multiplexed\nreadout system has lower cross-talk than a typical nonmultiplexed system.\n\n(13)\n\nin the neighboring bolometer channel, which should be\ncompared to the signal in Channel i,\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\ndPCh\ni ' dICh i Vmodule .\n\nFIG. 4: Stray reactances in the sub-kelvin multiplexer circuit\nare problematic since the circuit operates at MHz frequency\nwith characteristic impedances \u223c 1\u03a9.

The multiplexer modules are interfaced with\naluminum wire bonds to the detector wafer as shown in\nFigure 3. The circuit board is thermally sunk to the same\n250 mK temperature stage as the bolometers.\nThe inductors were custom fabricated at the NorthropGrumman superconducting micro-fabrication facility\nwith a lithographic process. Each chip consists of eight\ninductors, of which we use seven. One inductor is about\n1.5 mm \u00d7 1.5 mm, consisting of a 140 turn spiral (2 \u03bcm\nwidth niobium trace with pitch of 4 \u03bcm) separated by a\n50 nm SiO2 insulating layer from a niobium, flux-focusing\nwasher that is left floating. The 15.8 \u03bcH inductance is\nthe same for all channels in the module. The Northrop-\n\n10\n\n6\n5\n4\n\n8\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n575 580 585 590 595 600 605\n\n6\n\n\u03bcARMS\n\nThe spacing between LCRbolo resonances is chosen so\nthat the total bias carrier leakage current is less than 20%\nof the on-resonance carrier current, and the cross-talk is\nless than 0.5%. For the parameters of this system, this\nresults in a spacing of 15 times the LCRbolo bandwidth,\n75 kHz. This spacing also keeps Johnson noise leakage\nat a negligible level.\nHaving specified the channel spacing, the number\nof channels is defined by the bandwidth of the low\nimpedance amplifier. The SQUID shunt-feedback circuit (discussed in \u00a7IV B) for this system has a bandwidth\nof 1 MHz. The carriers are positioned between about\n400 kHz and 900 kHz, ensuring odd harmonics from lowfrequency carriers do not fall within the bandwidth of\nhigher frequency channels. Odd harmonics are the dominant form of distortion from SQUID non-linearity. Bias\ncarriers below 400 kHz are avoided because of the difficulty of finding high-Q capacitors with sufficiently high\ncapacitance that behave well at cryogenic temperatures.\nThese considerations result in 7 channels per multiplexer\nmodule so that the number of wires connecting the subkelvin multiplexer to the 4 K SQUID is the total number\nof detectors multiplied by 2/7.\nThe per-module channel count for APEX-SZ and SPT\nis conservative. A small increase in channel count could\neff\nso\nbe achieved by slowing the TES time constants \u03c4TES\nthat they are better matched to the absorber thermalization time \u03c4web , allowing narrower channel spacing. Substantial increases could be achieved by implementing a\nSQUID flux-locked loop (FLL) with substantially larger\nbandwidth such as Ref. [62]. Finally, much narrower\nchannel spacing could be realized by using a sharper\nband-pass filter than the single pole LCRbolo employed\nhere, although this would substantially complicate the\ncold circuit.\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nFrequency [kHz]\nFIG. 5: The resonant frequencies for each LCRbolo leg of\nthe multiplexer circuit are measured by frequency-sweeping\na small amplitude bias carrier across the range of carrier\nfrequencies with the bolometer stage temperature held just\nabove the detector superconducting transition. The resultant\nnetwork analysis data, shown in the amplitude vs. frequency\nplot above, is fitted with a model to determine the optimum\ncarrier bias frequency for each bolometer. One such fit is\nshown in the inset.\n\nGrumman superconducting microlab is no longer available, and inductors for new implementations of the fMUX\nsystem are now being fabricated at the National Institute\nfor Standards and Technology (NIST).\nThe frequency of each channel resonance is set by the\nseries capacitor, for which we use commercially available\nsurface mount capacitors. Our target spacing for the\n7-channel multiplexer is 75 kHz. Several capacitors, preselected by measuring their capacitances individually, are\nstacked in parallel to achieve the target capacitance for\neach channel. The capacitances change by several percent when cooled from room temperature to 0.25 K, but\nin general all devices shift proportionately and the channel spacing is sufficiently preserved.\nThe resonant frequencies for each multiplexer module\nare measured by frequency-sweeping a small amplitude\nbias carrier across the range of carrier frequencies with\nthe bolometer stage temperature held just above the detector superconducting transition. The amplitude of the\ncurrent through the SQUID is measured. A representative 'network analysis' amplitude vs. frequency plot for a\nmultiplexer module is shown in Figure 5. Each peak represents one bolometer channel, with its location, width,\nand height defined by the LCRbolo parameters. The bias\nfrequency for each bolometer is determined by fitting a\nmodel to each peak that includes parameters to account\nfor the current flowing through off-resonant LCRbolo legs\nin the multiplexer module.\n\n\f10\nF.\n\nEffects of Stray Reactances\n\nAlthough the sub-kelvin multiplexer components are\nrelatively simple, non-idealities in the form of stray inductances and capacitances can be problematic, since the\ncircuit operates at MHz frequencies with characteristic\nimpedances of about an ohm. The effect of these strays\nare discussed below.\nThe inductance of the cryogenic wiring that connects\nthe bias resistor (Rbias ) at 4 K to the sub-kelvin LCRbolo\nmultiplexer circuit is the most important stray, shown at\np1 and p2 in Figure 4. This inductance is outside each\nLCRbolo resonant circuit, and so cannot be tuned out\nat all of the carrier resonant frequencies. The voltage\ndrop across this reactance reduces the voltage across the\nbolometer and partially spoils the constant voltage bias\nthat is necessary for electro-thermal feedback. The effect is worse at higher frequency. To control this stray\ncomponent, the wiring is constructed of two segments: a\nlow inductance (\u223c0.3 nH/cm) broadside coupled stripline\nis used for the majority of the wiring distance, followed\nby a short segment of NbTi twisted pair (\u223c7 nH/cm)\nthat is necessary to create a low thermal conductivity gap between the two temperature stages. The total inductance for this wiring in the system implementation is about 105 nH, amounting to (0.2-0.6) j\u03a9 at 300900 kHz, increasing the impedance of the on-resonance\n0.75 \u03a9 bolometer circuit (Rbolo + j\u03c9Lstray ) by 3-27%.\nThere is also a much smaller stray inductance in series\nwith Rbias (p3 in Figure 4) that has the opposite effect\ncompared to the above, increasing the bias voltage across\nthe bolometer. The circuit board housing the SQUIDs\nand 30 m\u03a9 bias resistors has been optimized to minimize\nthis stray, which is estimated at \u223c4 nH. The total Rbias +\nj\u03c9Lstray reactance increases from 31 m\u03a9 at 300 kHz to\n38 m\u03a9 at 900 kHz. While this stray results in a large\nchange (as much as 26% at 900 kHz) in the effective bias\nvoltage across the bolometer, this phase and amplitude\nmodified voltage still provides an effective bias for the\npurposes of ETF. To see this, we note that it would be\npossible to bias the bolometer using just an inductance\nin place of the bias resistor, eliminating Johnson noise\nfrom this component. The drawback is that the strong\ndependence on frequency of this inductance-bias voltage\nstrategy would complicate the setup and tuning of the\nsystem. An inductive or capacitive voltage divider, as\ndescribed in Ref. [50], would address both issues.\nBoth stray inductances described above affect the\nphase of the bias carriers in addition to their amplitude.\nFortunately, the phase shifts of the two effects partially\ncancel. However, because of the lack of phase tuning capability for the demodulator in the backend electronics\nin this implementation of the readout (\u00a7IV C), this phase\nshift contributes to a slight degradation of noise at high\nfrequency.\nA stray capacitance is in parallel with the inductor (p4\nin Figure 4) that forms the LCRbolo series resonance for\neach multiplexer channel. This is due to a flux-focusing\n\nwasher below the spiral trace of each inductor. With\nthe present architecture, the resonance is in the 16 MHz\nrange. While this feature is well above the multiplexer\nbandwidth, the phase shift it produces can cause stability problems for the SQUID pre-amplifier feedback, discussed in \u00a7IV B.\nThe transimpedance pre-amplifier (a SQUID array in\nthis implementation) has non-zero input reactance (p5 in\nFigure 4). This means that currents injected along the\nnulling wire are split between two return paths: (1) the\ndesired path through the pre-amplifier, and (2) through\nthe bolometers. We refer to path (2) as \"nuller leakage\".\nLike the carrier voltage across the bias resistor, this leakage also appears as a voltage across the bolometers, with\nthe pre-amplifier reactance playing the role of a bias resistor. This effect is more pronounced at higher frequencies. When the nuller current phase and amplitude is adjusted so that the net (carrier and nuller) current through\nthe pre-ampifier is zero, the nuller current will be an exact inverted copy of the current through the bolometer.\nThe nuller current is adjusted in this manner when the\nbolometers are tuned, forming a 'virtual ground' at the\npre-amplifier input so that the net voltage across the input is zero after each tuning. Changes in observation\nloading conditions between bolometer tunings will result\nin a non-zero voltage across the pre-amplifier and alter\nthe voltage bias across the bolometer.\nAchieving the design requirements outlined in \u00a7 II C\nhas required careful handling of the stray components\ndescribed above. Future readout systems that employ\nhigher frequency carriers to multiplex a larger number of\nbolometer channels will need more advanced techniques\nto correct for these stray components.\n\nIV.\n\nSQUID PRE-AMPLIFIER AND ROOM\nTEMPERATURE ELECTRONICS\n\nHaving described the design considerations for the subkelvin components in the previous section, we now describe the SQUID control and backend electronics in this\nsection, beginning with the generation of the carriers\nthat bias the detectors, then describing the SQUID preamplifier and its room temperature control electronics,\nand ending with the demodulation electronics.\nThe topology of the system is shown in Figure 2\nfor one 7-channel fMUX module. APEX-SZ uses 40\nfMUX modules and SPT uses 120. Seven bias carriers are synthesized separately using Direct Digital Synthesizers (DDS) located on room temperature oscillator/demodulator boards. These analog carriers are\nadded together to form a bias 'comb' and transmitted via\na twisted pair cable and the room temperature SQUID\ncontroller board to the cryostat, where a 30 m\u03a9 bias resistor at 4 K produces a voltage bias across the bolometers operating at 250 mK. LC resonant filters in series with the bolometers select a single carrier tone for\neach bolometer. Changes in optical power on the de-\n\n\f11\n\nFIG. 7: Block diagram showing the carrier and nuller generation circuits. The sine and cosine outputs at the DDS have\namplitude adjustment registers that are not shown. The DDS\namplitudes are used to control the phase of the nuller signals\nby adjusting the admixtures of sine and cosine waves.\n\nFIG. 6:\n(Color online) Photo showing the oscillator/demodulator circuit board that provides the biases and\ndemodulates the outputs for 14 bolometer channels.\n\ntectors induce amplitude modulation of the carrier currents which are summed together and pass through the\ninput of a series-array SQUID device. The SQUID is\ncoupled to a room temperature operational amplifier to\nform a shunt-feedback flux-locked-loop circuit. A separate 'nulling comb', which is simply an inverted version of the carrier comb, is transmitted from the oscillator/demodulator boards to the SQUID input. This serves\nto cancel the large carriers, reducing the dynamic range\nrequirement for the SQUID. The nulled and amplified\ncomb is transmitted via a cable to a bank of seven demodulators located on the oscillator/demodulator boards.\nEach amplitude-modulated carrier is demodulated separately, low-pass filtered, and digitized. The digitized\nsky-signals are transmitted to a data acquisition computer and recorded on disk. Each of these components is\ndescribed in detail below.\n\nA.\n\nCarrier Generation\n\nThe bolometer bias carriers are synthesized on custom\ncircuit boards (Figure 6) that each handle 14 bolometer\nchannels. In addition to synthesizing the carriers, these\nboards also perform the demodulation and digitization of\nthe bolometer outputs described in \u00a7IV C. The layout of\nthese boards is optimized to minimize cross-talk between\nchannels and pickup from other electronics systems. A\nblock diagram showing the circuit used to generate the\ncarrier comb and nuller comb is shown in Figure 7.\nThe bias for each bolometer is generated with a Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS, Analog Devices AD9854)\nthat produces a sine wave by storing the waveform instantaneous phase in an accumulator and incrementing\nthis accumulator every clock cycle. It uses the phase\nto address a corresponding amplitude in a look-up table, and sends that amplitude to a digital-to-analog con-\n\nverter (DAC) sampling at 40 MHz. Because the phase\ninformation is held in only one register, it is not costly\nto achieve many bits of frequency resolution (these devices use a 48-bit phase accumulator and have \u03bcHz resolution). Having accurate amplitude information is more\ncostly since each memory location within the look-up table needs this accuracy. Our devices provide 12-bit amplitude information. The output waveform can be multiplied pre-digitization by an amplitude adjustment factor\nthat ranges from 0 to 1. In addition to the DAC providing the sine wave output, each DDS has a second DAC\noutput that has a fixed 90 degree phase offset (i.e., a\ncosine wave) and separate amplitude adjustment factor.\nThe DDS chips are the single biggest power consumers\nin the readout system, each one consuming \u223c0.4 W.\nThe DDS output signals are differential and each pass\nthrough low-pass 5.5 MHz analog filters to reduce clock\nbleed-through and limit the noise bandwidth of the bias\ncarriers. The sine-wave output is used for the bolometer bias signals. An 8-bit digital potentiometer is used\nto control this amplitude. A coarse voltage attenuator\ncan be enabled to provide further amplitude adjustment,\nallowing for good noise performance over a broad range\nof bolometer parameters. The analog differential output currents from eight oscillator circuits are summed\ntogether to produce a bias comb that is transmitted to\nthe cryostat via a twisted pair cable and the SQUID controller boards. Seven of these eight outputs are used to\nbias the bolometers, the eighth is used as a test signal\nthat can be injected one at a time to each of the bolometers in the comb.\nThe\n\u221a full scale carrier to white noise ratio is \u2248 6 \u00d7\n106 Hz, dominated by the digitization noise of the DDS.\nMore important than the white noise level however, is the\ncarrier sideband noise, since this noise eventually dominates at low frequencies and limits our ability to observe\nlarge angular scale signals on the sky. Carrier sideband\nnoise can originate from clock jitter, DDS voltage reference jitter, and/or current noise in the transistors used\nin the DDS DAC. This system is not sensitive to clockjitter, because the demodulator is driven by the same\noscillator as the bias, approximately canceling the effect.\n\n\f12\nThe dominant source of sideband noise is the low frequency noise of the DAC output transistors. This noise\nis proportional to the amplitude\n\u221a Ac of the carrier and\nmeasured to be \u223c Ac \u00d7 10\u22125 / Hz at 1 Hz away from the\ncarrier, with a 1/f power spectrum.\nIn addition to the bias carrier generation, the same\nDDS circuits are used to provide the nulling signal that\nzeros the carrier amplitude just before the SQUID input.\nThe nuller consists of an inverted version of the bias sinewave, with a small admixture of the cosine signal from\nthe second DDS output. The sum of these two signals is\nalso a sine wave with an phase that can be programmed\n(by adjusting the cosine amplitude) from about 158 to\n202 degrees from the bias carrier. This phase adjustment compensates for analog phase shifts between the\ncarrier and nuller that arise because the two signals take\ndifferent paths through the cold multiplexer (Figure 2).\nThe filtering, amplitude adjustment, coarse attenuation,\nand summing circuits are the same for the nulling signals\nas for the carriers.\nThis scheme for synthesizing the nulling signal was motivated so that, when the cosine admixture is small, the\nbias low-frequency carrier sideband noise would be inverted for the nuller signal and subtract to zero at the\ninput of the SQUID. This sideband-noise nulling was\ndemonstrated to work very well when adding the carrier\nto the nuller through a resistor. However, the scheme\ndoes not work when used to bias bolometers, since the\nbolometer has an effective negative resistance within its\nactive bandwidth. This means the sideband noise of the\ncarrier is inverted by the bolometer, while its MHz carrier is not inverted. The net result is that the carrier\nsideband noise adds coherently to the nuller sideband\nnoise. Though this results in excess low-frequency readout noise for this system, other sources of low-frequency\nnoise dominate our detector noise (e.g., residual atmosphere, temperature drifts, etc.), and the low frequency\nnoise from the readout does not dominate the overall low\nfrequency noise of the experiment. The digital fMUX\nsystem described in Ref. [51]) uses a different scheme for\nnulling that avoids this excess readout noise.\n\nB.\n\nSQUID Electronics\n\nTransimpedance amplification of the bolometer currents is achieved with a series-array SQUID operating\nin a shunt-feedback circuit with a room temperature opamp as shown in Figure 8. This circuit has the following\nproperties: (1) Its input impedance is sufficiently low so\nas not to spoil the voltage bias across the bolometers. (2)\nIt provides sufficient transimpedance so that the output\nsignals can be interfaced to standard room-temperature\namplifiers. (3) Its noise, referred to the input, is small\ncompared to the bolometer noise. (4) It is sufficiently\nlinear that intermodulation distortion is not an issue for\nthe system operation.\nFor the fMUX system, the SQUIDs are housed in\n\nFIG. 8: The SQUID shunt-feedback circuit is shown. The\ncapacitor and resistor that together form the lead-lag filter\n(refer to text) connect the non-inverting input of the operational amplifier to ground.\n\ngroups of eight on custom SQUID-mounting boards that\nare heat-sunk to the 4 K cryostat mainplate. The rest of\nthe shunt-feedback circuit resides on custom room temperature SQUID-controller circuit boards, each of which\nmanages eight SQUIDs. In addition to completing the\nshunt-feedback circuit, these electronics provide the bias\ncurrents for the SQUIDs and condition all analog signals\nentering the cryostat by attenuating them and filtering\nthem for RF.\n\n1.\n\nSeries Array SQUID\n\nEach bolometer module is connected directly to the\ninput coil of a series-array SQUID manufactured at\nNIST [63]. Each array consists of 100 individual SQUID\nelements with their input coils, feedback coils, and outputs connected in series. The input signals add constructively while the output noise voltage of the individual\nelements adds incoherently,\n\u221a resulting in a signal-to-noise\nratio that is enhanced by n, where n = 100\n\u221ais the number of elements. The array noise is 3.5 pA/ Hz referred\nto the input coil and the bandwidth is 120 MHz.\nEach SQUID element has two inductor coils that were\nintended for use separately as input coil and feedback\ncoil. For shunt-feedback, the input coil is used for both\nfunctions. This coil array has an input inductance LSQ\nIN '\n150 nH and mutual inductance for each 8-turn element\nSQ\nMIN\n' 80 pH.\nThe response function for an open-loop SQUID may\n\n\f13\nbe approximated as sinusoidal, with output voltage\nSQ\nVOU\nT ' VP K sin(2\u03c0IIN /I\u03a60 ),\n\n(16)\n\nwhere IIN is the current through the input coil, VP K is\nthe peak output voltage of the device, and I\u03a60 is the input\ncurrent required to provide a quantum of flux \u03a60 = h/2e\nthrough the SQUID. For our devices I\u03a60 \u2248 25 \u03bcA and\nVP K \u2248 1.5 \u2212 3.5 mV depending on fabrication reproducibility, operating temperature, and tuning. One can\nchoose the operating point along the sinusoidal response\ncurve using a static flux bias. For the shunt-feedback\ncircuit, the devices are operated on the mid-point of the\nfalling edge (see \u00a7IV B 5). The derivative of Equation 16\nSQ\nat this point is the transimpedance, Ztrans\n' \u2212500V /A,\nin good agreement with the measured performance of the\ndevices.\n\n2.\n\nShunt-feedback Circuit\n\nShunt-feedback (Figure 8 ) is essential for linearizing\nthe SQUID response and reducing the input reactance of\nthe FLL circuit so that the bolometer impedance dominates the bias loop. Had the more common feedback\nconfiguration with separate feedback and input coils been\nused, it would increase the FLL circuit input impedance\nsubstantially, spoiling the bolometer voltage bias and relegating it to an unstable regime of electro-thermal feedback.\nShunt-feedback is rarely used for practical SQUID applications, because it couples the the strong input coil directly to the room temperature electronics, where pickup\nfrom digital components or RF signals are more difficult\nto shield against. Implementation of a shunt-feedback\nsystem requires careful filtering and shielding to prevent\noutside unwanted signals from reaching the SQUID input\ncoil through the feedback line. Since this implementation\nis uncommon, the basic equations that characterize the\nshunt-feedback circuit operation are presented below.\nSQ\nAn open-loop SQUID has input reactance ZIN\n'\nSQ\nj\u03c9LIN (the reflected impedance of the SQUID is small\nat these frequencies and has been omitted), where \u03c9 is\nthe angular frequency. The forward voltage gain of the\nopen-loop SQUID/amplifier cascade is\nGF W D\n\n=\n=\n\nAM P\nVOU\nT\nSQ\nVIN\n\n=\n\nSQ\nSQ\n\u2212IIN\n|Ztrans\nGAM P |\nSQ\njIIN\n\u03c9LSQ\nIN\n\nSQ\nj|Ztrans\nGAM P |\n\n\u03c9LSQ\nIN\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\nSQ\nAM P\nwhere VOU\nand VIN\nare the voltages at the ampliT\nfier output and across the SQUID input coil respecSQ\ntively, IIN\nis the current through the SQUID input\ncoil, and GAM P ' 250 is the non-inverting amplifier\nforward gain. The SQUID transimpedance is written\n\nSQ\nSQ\nZtrans\n= \u2212|Ztrans\n| to make explicit its operation in inverting mode. It is a simple extension to include the\nphase response of the amplifier.\nWhen the switch in Figure 8 is closed to complete the\nfeedback loop, input current is split between the SQUID\ncoil and the feedback resistor, the latter of which has\nits impedance reduced by the forward gain of the circuit\ntot\nso that the total input impedance Zin\nis the parallel\ncombination\nSQ\ntot\nZin\n= ZIN\n||\n\nRF B\n.\n1 \u2212 GF W D\n\n(18)\n\n>\n\nFor this system GF W D \u223c 105 across a 1 MHz bandwidth\nand a computer controlled switch allows feedback resistors RF B = 3.3k\u03a9, 5k\u03a9, or 10k\u03a9 to be used. The circuit input impedance is 22-69 m\u03a9 in the frequency range\n300-900 kHz for the RF B = 10k\u03a9 feedback setting most\ncommonly used for SPT and APEX-SZ.\nThe SQUID response function (Equation 16) defines\nmax, open loop\nits open-loop dynamic range as IIN\n= I\u03a60 /2.\nThe shunt-feedback loop-gain\nASQ\nloop =\n\nSQ\n\u2212|Ztrans\n| \u00d7 GAM P\nRF B\n\n(19)\n\ndefines the extent to which the current through the\nSQUID coil is canceled by negative feedback, extending\nthe SQUID dynamic range to\n\u0013\n\u0012\nI\u03a60\n2 SQ\nmax\n(20)\nIIN =\n1 \u2212 Aloop\n2\n\u03c0\nand vastly improving its linearity. For the fMUX implementation, ASQ\nloop ' 38, 25, 12.5 for RF B = 3.3k\u03a9, 5k\u03a9,\nand 10k\u03a9 respectively. This results in a dynamic range\nthat is extended by a factor 23, 15, and 7, respectively.\nWhen the SQUID dynamic range is exceeded, the circuit \"flux-jumps\" such that the SQUID is locked in a\nstate one flux quantum or more away from its original\nlocking point. This is similar to an operational amplifier\nhitting its rail and 'sticking' there. The FLL has drastically deteriorated dynamic range and linearity in its\nflux-jumped state. A flux-jump can be caused by electrical pick-up (typically of fast, digital signals), electrical\nglitches, or (very rarely) by a large magnitude electronic\nnoise fluctuation.\nFor the 120 SQUID arrays in SPT, the flux-jumping\nrate is typically between 0 to 1 SQUID arrays per 24 hour\nobserving cycle. There are several means of recovering\nfrom a flux-jump. The simplest method is to 'reset' the\nloop by either opening and closing it again (using the\nswitch located in the feedback path, Figure 8) or removing and reinstating the SQUID bias. These 'reset' methods temporarily set the loop-gain ASQ\nloop to zero. This 'reset' only works if the input current through the SQUID\ncoil is zero, otherwise the SQUID-loop will not be locked\nat the original locking point. A complication for this\nmethod is that, with ASQ\nloop = 0, the input impedance\n\n\f14\ntot\nof the FLL is altered, which alters the resonant freZin\nquencies of the LCRbolo resonant circuits. This can spoil\nETF, causing the bolometer to oscillate and latch in a superconducting state. For the fMUX system, the SQUID\ninput is always non-zero, due to sky-signal and imperfections in setting the nulling amplitude. Consequently,\ninstead of 'resetting' the FLL, SQUID-jumps are recovered from by injecting a corrective current through the\nSQUID flux bias wire, and increasing this current until\nthe SQUID jumps back to the original locking point.\n\n3.\n\nFlux Locked Loop Stability\n\nTo maintain stability in the SQUID FLL circuit, phase\nshifts along the feedback loop must provide for negative\nfeedback up to the frequency where the loop-gain bandwidth product falls below unity, 38 MHz for RF B =\n3.3k\u03a9. The room temperature operational amplifier,\nwith a bandwidth of 1 MHz, induces a 90\u25e6 phase shift,\nallowing for an additional margin of 45\u25e6 . This places\nstringent requirements on the length of the wires connecting the SQUIDs to the room temperature amplifier\nsince a 0.66 m round-trip propagation delay amounts to\n45\u25e6 at 38 MHz. A one-way wiring length of 0.2 m is used\nfor APEX-SZ and SPT. In the absence of phase shifts\ninduced by strays, this lead length would allow stability.\nIn practice, phase shifts arise from other non-idealities,\nsuch as the parallel resonance formed by the capacitive\ncoupling of the MUX inductor to its flux-focusing washer\nor the wiring strays discussed in \u00a7III F.\nTo improve the FLL stability, a lead-lag filter is introduced and connects the output of the SQUID through a\ncapacitor and resistor to ground, see Figure 8. At high\nfrequency, this RC shunt-filter looks purely resistive and\nacts as a voltage divider with the SQUID output, attenuating the loop-gain. The filter introduces a phase shift at\nintermediate frequency, when the reactance of the capacitor is similar to the filter resistance. The filter capacitance is 1 nF and its resistance is set by a 0.2 m Manganin\nwire, about 15 \u03a9. This filter introduces a frequency dependence on the SQUID transimpedance, attenuating it\nby about 30% at the high end (900 kHz) of the fMUX carrier bandwidth. It also introduces a phase shift inside the\nfMUX carrier bandwidth. These two effects contribute to\na rise in the noise from the room temperature electronics\nat high bias carrier frequency, discussed in \u00a7V C.\n\n4.\n\nSQUID Electronics Implementation\n\nThe SQUID electronics are implemented on two circuit\nboards: (1) a SQUID mounting board that houses the\nSQUIDs at 4 K and provides magnetic shielding, and\n(2) a room temperature SQUID Controller that houses\nthe FLL operational amplifiers and SQUID bias current\ngeneration circuits, and conditions signals as they enter\nor exit the cryostat.\n\nFIG. 9: (Color online) Photo showing the SQUID mounting board, housing eight NIST SQUID series arrays and the\nbias resistors for the bolometers. The SQUIDs are mounted\non top of a Niobium film, visible in the photo. A magnetic\nshield enclosure, fabricated from the high magnetic permeability material Cryoperm, is shown above the circuit board.\n\nThe SQUID mounting boards, shown in Figure 9,\nare 0.15\u00d70.05 m2 custom printed circuit boards housing eight SQUIDs each. SQUIDs are sensitive to changes\nin magnetic field, so that effective magnetic shielding is\nessential. Since the system employs series array SQUIDs,\nit is important to attenuate spatial variations as well as\ntime variations in the magnetic field. This is because a\nspatial variation across the array would spoil the coherence of the individual SQUID elements.\nEach SQUID is mounted with rubber cement on top of\na 10\u00d710 mm2 niobium film that is epoxied to the SQUID\nmounting board. Niobium is a Type II superconductor\nand serves to pin magnetic field lines, greatly attenuating their time variability. The entire circuit board is\nplaced inside an enclosure built from a material that has\na high magnetic permeability at cryogenic temperatures\n(Cryoperm, Vacuumschmelze GmbH, Gr\u00fcner Weg 37 D63450, Hanau, Germany). This attenuates the amplitude\nof the field lines, reducing both the temporal and spatial\nvariability. The enclosure is open on two sides through\nnarrow \"chimneys\" to allow wiring connections to the\nroom temperature electronics through an edge connector, and to the cold multiplexer components through a\nbroadside coupled stripline that is soldered directly to\nthe board.\nThe 30 m\u03a9 bolometer bias resistors (Rbias in Figure 2)\nare located on the SQUID mounting boards. This is a\ncompromise, because the 4 K temperature\nmeans the bias\n\u221a\nresistors contribute about 2.5 pA/ Hz of noise referred\nto the SQUID input. This would be reduced to a negligible level had this bias resistor been placed at 0.25 K\nwith the sub-kelvin multiplexer components. By keeping\nthe resistor at 4 K, we are able to connect to each multiplexer comb with just two wires instead of four, reducing\nthe heat load on the sub-kelvin stage.\nThe SQUID controllers are 180\u00d7170 mm2 custom\nprinted circuit boards. One board provides the control\ncircuitry for eight SQUIDs. Each SQUID control circuit includes a high gain-bandwidth operational ampli-\n\n\f\u221a\nfier with low (1 nV/ Hz) input noise and two feedback\nresistors (5k\u03a9 and 10k\u03a9, RF B in Figure 8) that can be\nenabled individually or in parallel via software with an\nanalog CMOS switch (adjacent to RF B in Figure 8) that\nis selected for its low charge injection. A DAC provides\nfour software programmable voltages for each SQUID\nthat are used to (1) provide a current bias, about 150 \u03bcA,\nthrough the SQUID, (2) provide a flux bias current, 025 \u03bcA, to the SQUID input coil that is used to set the\nmagnetic field through the SQUID, (3) zero the offset of\nthe room temperature op-amp, and (4) provide a current\nto a heater resistor next to the SQUID that can be used\nto heat the SQUID above its superconducting transition.\nAnalog bolometer bias carrier signals and nulling signals are received from the oscillator/demodulator boards\nthrough isolation transformers on differential twisted pair\ncables, and attenuated on the SQUID controller board\nbefore being sent into the cryostat. The FLL output signals are transmitted from the SQUID controller boards\nto the oscillator/demodulator boards using differential\ndrivers feeding twisted pair cables.\nSQUIDs are very sensitive to digital pickup, so the digital circuitry on the SQUID controller boards is isolated\nfrom the analog circuitry by separating the local grounds\nand coupling the connections from the digital to analog\ncircuitry through resistor-capacitor filters. Balanced connections between the SQUID controller and the demodulator circuit boards also suppress digital interference from\nthe crate. Overall, digital noise pickup is negligible.\n\n5.\n\nVoltage at SQUID Output [mV]\n\n15\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n160 uA\n150 uA\n140 uA\n130 uA\n120 uA\n110 uA\n100 uA\n90 uA\n80 uA\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\nCurrent Through SQUID Coil [\u03bcA]\n\nFIG. 10:\n(Color online) The SQUID voltage response to\na linearly increasing current through the SQUID input coil\n(called a \"V-phi\" curve) is shown for several choices of the\nSQUID bias current ranging from 80 \u03bcA (bottom curve) to\n160 \u03bcA (top curve). The chosen SQUID operating point is\nmarked by a closed circle.\n\nSQUID Setup and Tuning\n\nThe sorption fridge that cools the sub-kelvin stage of\nthe system has a hold time of about 36 hours. Each time\nthis fridge is cycled, the SQUIDs are tuned to configure\nthem at their optimum operating point.\nAs the mainplate is cooled to 4 K, the SQUIDs cross\ntheir superconducting transition relatively slowly, with a\nthermal gradient across the series arrays. This gradient\ncan transform time varying magnetic fields into spatially\nvarying trapped flux across the series array. The first\nstep in the tuning process is to raise the temperature\nof each SQUID by providing current to a heater resistor\nlocated next to it, bringing the device into the normal\nstate and then allowing it to cool quickly, reducing the\nprobability that time varying fields will be converted into\nspatially trapped flux.\nThe next step is to map out the SQUID output voltage response to a current through its input coil (approximated by Equation 16) as a function of the SQUID bias\ncurrent, as shown in Figure 10. The bias current choice\ndefines which of these \"V-phi\" curves the SQUID operates on.\nThe derivative of the V-phi curve is the SQUID tranSQ\nsimpedance Ztrans\n. It defines the SQUID small signal\nresponse and is the quantity that refers the room temperature electronics noise back to an equivalent noise cur-\n\nFIG. 11: Block diagram of the demodulator circuit.\n\nSQ\nrent through the bolometer. Ideally, Ztrans\nwould be\nmaximized. The peak-to-peak amplitude relates to the\nSQUID's large signal response. The distance between\npeaks in each V-phi curve is the current required to produce a flux quantum through the SQUID coil, and is\nindependent of the bias current. For stable SQUID operation, a smooth curve with a high level of symmetry\naround the chosen flux bias point is preferred. A typical choice for the SQUID operating point is indicated\nby the small red circle on the 150 \u03bcA SQUID bias curve\n(2nd from top). This represents a trade off between the\ncriteria listed above.\nOnce the SQUID response has been mapped and the\nbias currents chosen, the feedback loop is closed so that\nthe FLL is in its low input impedance state, allowing for\nbolometer operation.\n\nC.\n\nDemodulator and Digitization\n\nEach bolometer channel has its own analog demodulator that locks into the bias carrier and mixes the sky-\n\n40\n\n\f16\nsignal down to base-band. This demodulator is referenced with the same analog sine wave that biases its\nbolometer, serving to cancel the clock-jitter sideband\nnoise. Sixteen demodulator channels are housed on each\noscillator/demodulator board, as described in \u00a7IV A.\nEight demodulators (half of an oscillator/demodulator\nboard) monitor each multiplexer module, consisting of\nseven bolometer channels. Seven of the demodulators are\nphase-locked to the in-phase I component of the seven\nbolometer carriers. The system was originally conceived\nwith 8 bolometers per module, but this has been reduced\nto seven so that the eighth \"helper\" demodulator can\nbe used periodically to measure the Q component (90\ndegrees out of phase) of each channel. Being able to\nsimultaneously observe both I and Q components facilitates fast setup of the nulling signal amplitude and phase\ndiscussed in \u00a7IV E.\nEach module of eight demodulators is AC coupled to\nthe differential SQUID controller output through capacitors. An input transformer suppresses common-mode\nsignals. In front of the coupling capacitors, a separate\nanalog to digital converter (ADC) samples the SQUID\nstatic offset at 1 kHz, which is necessary for tuning the\nSQUIDs and monitoring for flux-jumps.\nThe signal from an individual bolometer is mixed down\nto base-band by multiplying it with a unit amplitude\nsquare wave. This is achieved (Figure 11) by passing the\nreference carrier sinusoid through a comparator and using its output to control an analog switch that acts as a\nsynchronous rectifier on the input waveform. The output\nof this rectifier is sent to a pair of low-pass RC integrator circuits that remove the high frequency out-of-band\nsignals produced by the other bolometer channels. The\nrectifier operates in a doubly-balanced mode, with differential input signals, not shown in Figure 11, as well as\nthe differential output. This implementation is built up\nfrom discrete components and has excellent distortion\nperformance because there are no non-linear elements.\nAn instrumentation amplifier, with gain that is software\nselectable over two orders of magnitude, takes the difference between the two integrators. The preceding stages\nhave sufficient gain to override the instrumentation amplifier's low-frequency noise. The amplified base-band\nsignal is anti-alias filtered with an 8-pole active low-pass\nfilter operating at 400 Hz and digitized with a 12-bit ADC\nat 1 kHz.\nA Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) on each\noscillator/demodulator board assembles the outputs from\nthe ADCs and sends the data via an 8-bit parallel low\nvoltage differential signal (LVDS) connection to the readout control computer. A software low-pass filter with a\n35 Hz pass-band is applied to the data, which is then\ndown-sampled to 100 Hz and written to disk.\n\nFIG. 12: (Color online) Photo showing the three readout\nelectronics crates (top half of each rack) housing the oscillator/demodulator circuit boards in the cabin of the South\nPole Telescope. Control computers, cryogenic housekeeping,\ntiming, and network electronics are also visible in the bottom\nhalf of the racks.\n\nD.\n\nReadout Electronics Crates, Interface, and\nPower Consumption\n\nThe 16-channel oscillator/demodulator circuit boards\n(Figure 6) are 340\u00d7360 mm2 in size and 20 circuit boards\nare packaged together in a 9U Versa Module Eurocard\n(VME) crate with custom backplanes that provide power\nto the boards and connect to the control computer. Each\ncrate is convectively cooled with fans and has an integrated power supply. The power consumption is about\n900 W per crate including the power delivered to the\nSQUID Controller electronics described above. Three\ncrates (2700 W) house the oscillator/demodulator electronics for the 840 bolometer channels of SPT (photo\nFigure 12). The 280 channel APEX-SZ system requires\none crate (900 W).\nThe center slot of each crate is used for a clock distribution circuit board that sends a central 40 MHz system clock and a once per second GPS-derived timestamp\nacross the backplane to each oscillator/demodulator\nboard. The system clock and timestamp signals can be\ndaisy-chained across several clock distribution boards in\ndifferent crates.\nThe system is interfaced to a control computer, running the Scientific Linux operating system. Command\nsignals are received from the control computer through\na single RS485 serial signal distributed across the backplane and encoded using the communications protocol\nModbus (see http://www.modbus.org). Bolometer data,\nsampled at 1 kHz, flow from the readout crate backplanes\nto the control computer through an 8-bit parallel low\nvoltage differential signal (LVDS) digital output bus operating at 40 MHz.\n\n\f17\n\nE.\n\nBolometer Tuning\n\nThe bolometers are tuned by adjusting the bias voltage for each detector and measuring changes in current\nthrough the bolometer using the oscillator/demodulator\nboards. The tuning algorithms are implemented in software running on the readout control computer.\nThe bolometer tuning takes place after the SQUIDs\nhave been tuned (see \u00a7IV B 5) and the LCRbolo resonances have been determined with a network analysis\n(see \u00a7III E).\nThe first step is to cool the bolometer stage to about\n\u223c800 mK, which is above the TES transition temperature\nbut below that of the aluminum leads connecting the\ndetectors to the cold multiplexer.\nOnce this temperature is reached, the detectors are\nprovided with a sufficiently large electrical bias that the\ndevices will remain above their transition temperature\nwhen the bolometer stage is cooled to its operating temperature of 250 mK. Since the SQUID dynamic range is\nnot sufficient to handle seven bias carriers simultaneously,\nthe seven detectors in a multiplexer module are biased\nsequentially. After each bias is turned on, a nulling sinusoid is adjusted to cancel the carrier signal at the SQUID\ninput, before the next TES bias is activated.\nThe optimum nulling sinusoid amplitude and phase\nare determined using measurements of both the I and\nQ components of the demodulated bolometer current as\nprovided by each bolometer's demodulator and the oneper-multiplexer module \"helper\" demodulator. After the\noptimum phase is determined, the \"helper\" demodulator is no longer needed, and can later be used to tune\nanother channel. Once all seven channels in the multiplexer module are biased and nulled, the bolometer stage\ntemperature is lowered to its operating temperature of\n\u223c250 mK. The nulling amplitudes are fine-tuned at this\ntemperature to correct for slight impedance changes in\nthe circuit.\nThe seven bolometers in each module are lowered into\ntheir transition sequentially by decreasing the electrical\nbias power. For a given bolometer, the bias voltage amplitude is decreased while iteratively adjusting the nuller\namplitude and phase to keep the current through the\nSQUID zero (this corrects for the voltage drop across\nthe SQUID input, p5 in Figure 4, as discussed in \u00a7 III F).\nThis traces out the bolometer current vs. voltage curve\n(Figure 13). In the upper-right portion of the curve, the\nTES electrical bias power is sufficient to hold the device above its superconducting transition. As the bias\nvoltage is lowered, the device falls into its transition and\nis held there by ETF. \"Turn-around\" is defined as the\n\n7\nCurrent [ \u03bcARMS ]\n\nA digital token is passed sequentially from board to\nboard through a dedicated hardware port to define which\ncircuit board has control of the output bus. This protocol\nallows all boards in the system to share the same digital\noutput.\n\n6.5\n6\n5.5\n5\n4\n\n4.5\n5\n5.5\nBias Voltage [ \u03bcVRMS]\n\nFIG. 13:\nA current vs. voltage curve is shown for an\nSPT TES bolometer operating dark at a bath temperature\nof 0.29 K. In the upper-right portion of the curve, the TES\nelectrical bias power is sufficient to hold the device above its\nsuperconducting transition, with constant resistance \u2206V /\u2206I.\nAs the bias voltage is lowered, the device falls into its transition and is held there by electro-thermal feedback (ETF).\n\"Turn-around\" is defined as the minimum in the curve, about\n4.7 \u03bcV, when the dynamic resistance \u2202V /\u2202I transitions from\npositive to negative.\n\nminimum in the curve (4.7 \u03bcV in Figure 13) when the\ndynamic impedance \u2202V /\u2202I transitions from positive to\nnegative (the average TES resistance \u2206V /\u2206I is always\npositive). At this point the detector ETF loop-gain L is\nunity. Once the TES reaches its target operating resistance, the bias voltage is held constant and the current is\nonce again nulled at the SQUID input. All seven bolometers in the multiplexer comb are tuned sequentially in\nthis manner. The tuning of bolometers in different multiplexer modules across the system is performed in parallel.\nFor astronomical observations with SPT (APEX-SZ), the\nTES sensors are typically operated at 60-80% (80-90%)\nof their normal resistance corresponding to typical ETF\nloop-gains L\u223c15-20.\nAfter the electrical bias power of each detector in the\nsystem has been decreased so the detectors are operating in their superconducting transition, the demodulator\ngain is increased from its high dynamic range setting to\none of its low noise settings, that has 33-100 times larger\ngain. The nulling amplitudes are fine-tuned and astronomical observations can commence.\nWhen detector loading conditions change, for example, when a large change in observing elevation is made,\nadjustments in the nulling may be necessary. Significant\nchanges in detector loading may necessitate re-tuning of\nthe detectors.\n\n6\n\n\f18\nV.\n\nSYSTEM PERFORMANCE\n\nIn this section, measurements of the system\nperformance-including noise, sensitivity, and crosstalk-are presented.\n\nA.\n\nSystem Setup\n\nFor SPT and APEX-SZ, the bolometer tuning (described in more detail in \u00a7 IV E) is integrated with the cycling of the sub-kelvin sorption fridge to minimize the total system setup time. The sorption fridge is cycled every\n24-36 hours, elevating the temperature of the bolometers\nand SQUIDs to above their superconducting transition.\nThis necessitates a re-tuning of the bias parameters for\nboth. The process used for SPT is outlined below.\nThe SQUIDs are returned to their operating temperature mid-way through the cryogenic cycle and are tuned\n(\u00a7 IV B 5) in parallel with the second half of the cycle.\nAt this point, the bolometers are above their superconducting transition. The SQUIDs are first heated for 30\nseconds to release trapped flux and are subsequently allowed to cool quickly through their transition. Following\nthis cooling, it takes about 25 minutes for the SQUIDs\nto return to their base operating temperature. Next,\nvoltage-current curves (Figure 10) are measured for each\nSQUID to determine their optimal flux and current bias.\nFor SPT, tuning all 120 SQUIDs takes \u223c25 minutes, and\nis performed in parallel with the sorption fridge's cycle,\ntherefore coming at no cost to the observing efficiency.\nTowards the end of the cryogenic cycle, the bolometer\nstage is left at \u223c800 mK so that the detectors are above\ntheir superconducting transition. The control computer\ncommands the readout system to bias the detectors with\nenough electrical power to hold the TES normal and tune\nthe nulling current to cancel the bias at the SQUID input (\u00a7IV E); this takes about 10 minutes. After this, it\ntakes about 2 hours for the sorption fridge to cool the\nbolometer stage to its \u223c250 mK base temperature. Once\nthe cooling is complete, it takes about 15 minutes to\nadjust each detector voltage bias to the desired point\nin its superconducting transition, and then to re-adjust\nthe nulling current (\u00a7IV E). An I-V curve is recorded for\neach detector (e.g., Figure 13). The total time elapsed\nfor readout/bolometer system tuning and setup is about\n25 minutes, not counting the time (several hours) that\nwould otherwise be spent cycling the cryogenics.\nSPT has 724 operational detectors. Others have wiring\nor other defects that prevent their operation. Typically\n650\u00b115 of these detectors show good performance each\ntuning and are used for astronomical observations. Detailed statistics and characterization of end-to-end receiver performance are presented in a separate publication [52].\n\nB.\n\nElectrical Cross-Talk\n\nChannel-to-channel cross-talk can occur through optical signals or electrical signals. Optical cross-talk between adjacent bolometers in SPT and APEX-SZ is typically about 1% and is determined by the optical design of\nthe experiment and the arrangement of detectors within\na silicon wafer. The goal is for electrical cross-talk arising in the readout system and discussed in \u00a7 III C to be\nsmall in comparison to this optical cross-talk.\nElectrical cross-talk in the multiplexer readout has\nbeen measured both in the laboratory and during skyobservations.\nFor the laboratory measurement [25],\none detector, mounted in its own light-tight enclosure,\nwas excited with light from an LED. Five other sensors\nwere read out on the same fMUX module, but mounted\nin a separate light-tight enclosure. The absence of any\nmeasurable signal in the five dark channels established\nan upper limit of 0.4% electrical cross-talk.\nCross-talk has been characterized with on-sky observations of RCW38, MAT5A, Venus and Jupiter with the\nSouth Pole Telescope. Though we cannot distinguish between positive cross-talk that arises from optical versus\nelectrical sources, negative cross-talk should be dominated by electrical signals. The signal-to-noise levels for\nRCW38 and MAT5A are substantially lower than for the\nplanets, and no negative cross-talk is observed. Using\nthe observations of Venus and Jupiter, which produce\nsignals that are large enough for small cross-talk signals\nto be observed in neighbors, a median cross-talk between\nneighbors of 0.3% is observed. This is consistent with\nthe expectation of 0.25% and 0.3% from mechanisms (2)\nand (3) described in \u00a7 III C.\n\nC.\n\nNoise Performance\n\nIn this section, the measured noise levels for a dark\ndetector in the laboratory and an SPT detector observing\nthe sky are compared with the theoretical expectations.\nThe noise contributions are divided into three categories: photon noise, bolometer noise, and readout system noise. Within each category, a contribution may\narise as a current or power source. Sky signals arise as\npower sources (photons converted to heat), so that noise\nequivalent power (NEP) is the relevant metric. Other\nsources, such as the SQUID noise, are constant in terms\nof an input referred current, and are labeled here as current noise sources. The NEP of current noise contributors depends on the device parameters and operating\nconditions and is converted from current to NEP by multiplying the SQUID-input referred current noise\u221aby the\nRMS\ninverse of the detector responsivity, \u223c \u2212Vbias\n/ 2 (see\nEquation A6 in Appendix A) which is valid in the limit\nof high loop-gain.\nAchieving optimal noise performance with TES\nbolometers for astronomical observations requires a careful optimization of detector and readout system param-\n\n\f1.\n\nDark Noise\n\nIn Figure 14 (top, solid line) the noise equivalent power\n(NEP) density is shown for a representative SPT detector operated in the laboratory with no incident radiation\npower (\"dark\"). The detector has a saturation power of\n\u1e20\u2206T ' 25 pW. Its normal resistance RNormal = 0.98 \u03a9\nand it has been lowered into the transition to 0.73 RNormal\nwith a voltage bias of 4.2 \u03bcVRMS (the current-voltage\ncurve for this detector was shown in Figure 13). The\nroll-off in the measured noise at 35 Hz is due to the readout system's software low-pass filter described in \u00a7 IV C.\nNoise expectations for this detector are summarized in\nTable II. Columns are included for dark operation (zero\nradiation power, shown in the top panel of Figure 14\nas a dashed line) and for a radiation loading of 11 pW\n(shown in the bottom panel of Figure 14 and discussed\n\n100\n\n10\n1\n\nNEP a e] / !H( c\n\neters. Most important amongst these is the power required to saturate the detectors, Psat . If this power is\nmany times higher than the absorbed radiation power (or\nthe detector is dark, so that there is no radiation power),\nthermal phonon noise will be high and relatively large\nvoltage biases must be used to provide the Joule heating necessary to keep the detector in its transition. The\nhigh voltage bias results in an amplification of current\nnoise sources when they are referred to NEP, so that the\nreadout component of the noise is greatly enhanced. On\nthe other hand, if Psat is too small, the detector will not\nhave enough dynamic range to operate through a broad\nrange of observing conditions. Typically Psat is set to be\nroughly twice the expected absorbed incident radiation\n(\u2248 2 \u00d7 Prad ) .\nBefore describing the noise contributions below, we\nnote that a mixer responds differently to noise that is\nencoded as a modulation on the carrier and noise that is\nsuperimposed on the carrier at the same frequency (see\nAppendix A). This implementation of the fMUX system\nuses a square-wave mixer (\u00a7 IV C), which introduces a\nfurther distinction between (a) broadband noise sources\nthat are superimposed on both the carrier frequency and\nits harmonics, and (b) narrow-band noise sources that\nare superimposed on the carrier but do not extend out\nto the carrier harmonics. SQUID noise is an example\nof (a) because its bandwidth is not limited. Bolometer\nJohnson noise is an example of (b) because its bandwidth\nis limited by the LCRbolo filter. For a square mixer,\nthese noise sources are enhanced\nin the demodulation\n\u221a\nprocess by factors of \u03c02 and 2 respectively, in comparison to noise that modulates the carrier. Fortunately,\nin an alternating-voltage biased system,\n\u221a power terms receive an enhancement by a factor 2 (with respect to\na constant-voltage biased system) during the modulation process, so that the signal-to-noise ratio is nearly\nunaffected by these factors in comparison to a constantvoltage biased system. Appendix A presents a detailed\ndiscussion and derivation of the relevant factors.\n\nNEP [ aW / !Hz ]\n\n19\n\n10\nFrequency [ Hz ]\n\n100\n\nPu!\"!& N!y#r\n\n[!\"ez N!y#r P!$r%\nPu!&!& N!y#r\nWreq!'\" N!y#r\n\n10\n1\n\n10\nF%r)'r&n* a H( c\n\nFIG. 14:\nThe measured noise equivalent power (NEP)\nspectrum density for an SPT TES bolometer operated at\n0.73RNormal in the laboratory with no incident radiation\n(\"dark\") is shown (top, solid line) with the theoretical expectation from Table II superimposed (top, dashed line). This\nconfiguration represents the worst possible configuration for\nthe readout noise contribution, since the incident power is\nzero. This means the voltage bias, which refers current noise\nsources to noise equivalent power, is maximal. In the lower\npanel the on-sky noise for this detector is estimated assuming\na total radiation loading of 11 pW and the detector parameters of Table II. With radiation power, the detector voltage\nbias is lower and the readout noise is reduced when referred\nto NEP.\n\nin \u00a7 V C 2), which is typical of the 150 GHz detectors for\nSPT. Table II also includes the equations and parameters\nused to estimate each noise component. A similar table\nappears in Ref. [2] for APEX-SZ detectors. The noise\ncontributions for \"dark\" operation are described below.\nTES detectors exhibit thermal carrier (or phonon)\nnoise, which arises from random variations in the flow\nof phonons from the TES to the thermal bath. A factor\n\u03b3NE has been included in the Table II equation describing this noise to account for a temperature gradient along\nthe thermal link [64]. We have taken \u03b3NE = 0.5 [56], consistent with a normal metal link at our operating temperatures. For the dark detector power spectrum density shown in Figure 14, thermal carrier noise dominates\nabove 1 Hz and is eventually cut-off by the TES time\neff\nconstant \u03c4TES\n\u223c 1 ms, which is not visible in the plot as\nit is beyond the low-pass filter cut-off.\nBoth the detector and bias resistor produce Johnson\nnoise in the narrow LCRbolo pass-band that surrounds\nthe\np carrier.

For a sinusoidal-biased TES, this Johnson\nnoise beats with the carrier and is mixed down to baseband where its thermal power lies within the detector\ntime constant and is suppressed by electro-thermal feedback. This suppression is similar to that which takes\nplace for a static-biased TES [61], and is derived in Appendix B of Ref. [65]. For the operating parameters of\nSPT and APEX-SZ detectors, the TES Johnson noise\nsuppression needs to be calculated numerically, but can\nbe approximated by \u223c 1/L for the component that is\nin-phase with the bias carrier [65] (the out-of-phase component receives no suppression, but is discarded by the\ndemodulator). The bias resistor suppression is less than\n20% [65] and has been neglected in the noise expectation tabulated in Table II. For a sinusoidal-biased\n\u221a detector, Johnson noise is enhanced by a factor 2 because uncorrelated noise from both sidebands appear\n\npost-demodulation, as discussed in Appendix A. This\nnoise is referred to a noise equivalent\npower by the in\u221a\nRMS\nverted responsivity \u223c \u2212Vbias\n/\n2.\nThe\nresult is that\n\u221a\nthe total Johnson noise is 4kB Tbolo Pelec /L, exactly as\nit would be for a detector biased with a static voltage.\nThe readout electronics contribute noise from the bias\nresistor, SQUID, and room temperature electronics as\ndescribed below. As described in \u00a7 IV, each multiplexer\nmodule bias resistor is located at 4 K adjacent to the\nSQUIDs (see Figure 1) rather than on the sub-kelvin\nstage adjacent to the detectors. This higher temperature\nresults in higher Johnson noise from the bias resistor.\nThe advantage is that the number of wires connecting\nto the sub-kelvin stage is just two per multiplexer comb,\nrather than the four wires that would be required if the\nbias resistors were located on the sub-kelvin stage. This\nnoise contribution could be made negligible by using a ca-\n\n\fpacitive voltage divider [50], an inductive bias, or moving\nthe bias resistor to lower temperature.\nThe \u221a\nSQUIDs contribute a white noise level of\n3.5 pA/ Hz. Since the detectors are biased at high frequency, the bolometer signals are modulated at frequencies well above the 1/f noise of the SQUIDs and pre-mixer\namplifiers in the room temperature system.\nThe room\n\u221a\ntemperature electronics noise is 3.7 pA/ Hz, after being\nreferred back to the bolometer current by the SQUID\nSQ\nSQ\ntransimpedance, Ztrans\n. A higher Ztrans\n\u221a would reduce\nthis noise that is dominated by the 1 nV/ Hz input noise\nof the first stage amplifier that follows the SQUID inside\nthe flux locked loop. The room temperature electronics noise also receives contributions from Johnson noise\nin the resistors that set the gain of the amplifiers and\nconvert voltages to currents.\nWhen we account for these noise contributions, the\ntotal noise expectation is in good agreement with measurements of dark detectors as shown in Figure 14.\n\n2.\n\nOn-Sky Noise\n\nThe noise expectation for the detector shown in Figure 14, extrapolated to typical SPT 150 GHz observing\nconditions with 11 pW of incident radiation power, is\nshown in the \"on-sky\" column of Table II. This radiation power results in a reduction of the Joule heating\nnecessary to keep the detector at 0.73 RNormal , so that\nthe detector is tuned with a lower bias voltage.\nThis\nlower bias voltage results in a reduced NEP for all current\nnoise sources, such as the three components of readout\nnoise listed in Table II. Since the low frequency noise\nfrom the readout system is proportional to the bias voltage amplitude, its amplitude is also reduced. If readout\nwere the only contribution to low-frequency noise, the\nknee would be at 0.4 Hz for this detector parameters.\nIn addition to the thermal carrier noise, ETF suppressed Johnson noise, and readout noise, fluctuations\nin the rate of incident photons produces an additional\nnoise term corresponding to photon shot noise and photon correlations [66, 67], also included in Table II for the\n\"on-sky\" detector. The degree of photon correlation depends on poorly characterized details of the filters and\ncoupling, so that the coefficient \u03be [68] is often introduced\nto parametrize a correction factor for the simple equation\npresented in Table II. \u03be lies between 0-1, with 0.3 being\na reasonable choice. Table II includes noise expectations\nspanning the full range.\nThe power spectrum distribution for a representative\n150 GHz bolometer operating \"on-sky\" during the 2009\nobserving season on the South Pole Telescope is shown in\nFigure 15. This data corresponds to the raw timestream;\nno filtering has been applied to remove atmospheric signals or other effects. The SPT bolometer stage was operated at a bath temperature of Tbath =260 mK and the\ndetector has sufficiently similar device parameters to the\ndark detector, shown in Figure 14, that its total noise ex-\n\nNEP [ aW / !Hz ]\n\n21\n\n100\n\n10\n1\n\n10\nFrequency [ Hz ]\n\nFIG. 15: Power spectrum distribution of a bolometer observing in the 150 GHz band on the South Pole Telescope is\nshown. The low frequency noise is primarily due to atmospheric fluctuations. This detector's performance is typical\nfor detectors in the 150 GHz band and agrees well with the\nexpectation, shown as a shaded band. Its measured\nnoise\n\u221a\nequivalent temperature (NETCMB ) is 409 \u03bcK * s projected\non the sky.\n\npectation is the same to within 2% of the values presented\nin Table 14. Superimposed on Figure 15 is a shaded band\ncorresponding to the noise expectation for this detector,\nexcluding atmospheric contributions. The width of the\nshaded band indicates the range of allowed photon correlations 0 < \u03be < 1.\nAt frequencies below \u223c3 Hz, the spectrum is dominated by atmospheric fluctuations that are not included\nin the theoretical expectation presented in Table II. For\nscience analyses, filtering and subtraction techniques (see\ne.g., [33]) applied in the data processing pipeline are\nused to reduce the effect of atmospheric signals to below 1 Hz. Above this frequency, the spectrum agrees\nwell with the expectation. After calibrating this detector\nresponse with astrophysical\nsources, its measured sensi\u221a\ntivity is 409 \u03bcKCMB * s projected on the sky and referred\nto a source at the CMB temperature. This is typical of\nSPT 150 GHz detector performance. Noise and sensitivity statistics for the APEX-SZ and SPT receiver systems\nare presented in Refs. [52] and [2] respectively.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented the design and performance of the\nSQUID-based frequency-domain multiplexed (fMUX)\nreadout system that has been deployed for TES detectors\non the APEX-SZ instrument and the South Pole Telescope SZ-camera. The readout reduces the heat-load on\nthe sub-kelvin cryogenic stage by sharing wiring among\nmany detectors using a simple architecture that minimizes the sub-kelvin system complexity. It has near-zero\npower dissipation on the sub-kelvin stage, is extensible\nto much higher multiplexing factors, allows bias levels\nto be set individually for each detector, is modular with\nno shared components between readout modules, and exhibits strong reduction of microphonic response and low-\n\n\f22\nfrequency EMI because the sky signals are modulated up\nto high frequency.\nThe system has been characterized in terms of noise\nperformance, sensitivity, detector yield, and cross-talk in\nboth the laboratory and with on-sky observations. The\nmeasured noise equivalent power of the system is consistent with theoretical expectations, and contributions\nfrom the readout system are small in comparison to detector and photon noise above 1 Hz. At low frequencies,\nthe system noise is dominated by residual atmospheric\nfluctuations.\nThese implementations have shown that frequencydomain multiplexing is an effective technology for scaling to very large arrays of TES detectors. An upgraded\ndigital version of the analog fMUX back-end electronics has recently been developed [51] and has been deployed for the EBEX [69] balloon-borne CMB polarimeter and the ground-based POLARBEAR [70] CMB polarimeter.\nA polarimeter camera [71] for the South\nPole Telescope is being commissioned during the austral\n2011/2012 summer and uses the digital fMUX. The\ndigital fMUX system achieves an order of magnitude\nlower power consumption, higher multiplexing factors,\nfaster detector and SQUID setup, better low frequency\nnoise performance, and lower cost. Development is underway to develop fMUX electronics for satellite applications [72].\nPresent prototypes use Digital Active\nNulling [73] in place of the flux-locked loop. This extends\nthe SQUID bandwidth to allow for 64 bolometers per\nSQUID module using a single pair of sub-Kelvin wires.\n\nAppendix A: Modulation and demodulation transfer\nfunctions for alternating-voltage biased bolometers\n\nIn this section, we consider the transfer functions for\nthe modulation and demodulation of signals for a bolometer voltage biased with a constant amplitude sinusoidal\ncarrier. We also consider the transfer function for noise\nthat is superimposed on the amplitude-modulated carrier.\nFirst consider a single Fourier component of a small\npower signal Ps cos \u03c9s t absorbed by a bolometer that is\nbiased deep in its transition with a constant amplitude\nvoltage bias Vbias = Vc sin \u03c9c t.\nUnder the assumption of strong electro-thermal feedback (ETF), the total power on the detector will be constant and determined by the average thermal conductivity \u1e20 and temperature difference from the bolometer to\nits bath \u2206T = Tbolo \u2212 Tbath ,\nPTOTAL = \u1e20\u2206T = Vbias Ibolo + Prad + Ps cos \u03c9s t, (A1)\nwhere Prad is the approximately constant radiation loading power from the sky. The amplitude of the bolometer\nvoltage bias is constant, so that the power signal produces an amplitude modulation Is on the bolometer carrier current Ic :\nIbolo = (Ic + Is cos \u03c9s t) sin \u03c9c t.\n\n(A2)\n\nKeeping only the time varying terms from Equation A1,\nthe power balance is\n\u2212 Ps cos \u03c9s t = Vc Is cos \u03c9s t sin2 (\u03c9c t).\n\n(A3)\n\nSince the carrier frequency \u03c9c is much faster than the\nbolometer time constant, the sin2 (\u03c9c t) factor integrates\nto 1/2, leading to\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Andy Smith for useful discussions and design/fabrication of niobium inductors at Northrup Grumman, Kent Irwin and Gene Hilton for useful discussions\nand design/fabrication of the series array SQUIDs at\nNIST, and Hannes Hubmayr, Bryan Steinbach, Kam\nArnold, and Graeme Smecher for useful discussions of\nbolometer responsivity and demodulator response.\nThe National Science Foundation funds APEX-SZ\nthrough grants AST-0138348 & AST-0709497 and the\nSouth Pole Telescope through grants ANT-0638937 and\nANT-0130612.

For simplicity, we\nhave left out the factor that accounts for the bolometer time constant.

Waveforms for the special case\nof a sinusoidal input demodulated with a square wave reference is shown at right.\n\nsquare-wave demodulation (the mixer reference used for\nthis implementation of the fMUX system) as a function of\nthe phase difference between the carrier and the demodulator, \u03c6ref . The results for in-phase I demodulation and\n90-degree out-of-phase Q demodulation are summarized\nin Table III.\nA generic demodulator is shown in Figure 16 (left),\nwhere an input signal x(t) is multiplied by a reference\nsignal c(t) then integrated with a low-pass filter (LPF) to\nproduce the output z(t). The cutoff frequency of the LPF\nis much lower than the reference frequency and much\nlarger than the modulation-encoded sky-signals.\nFor the special case of an on-resonance, in-phase sinusoidal input x(t) = Ic sin(\u03c9c t) and a unit amplitude sinewave reference c(t) = sin(\u03c9c t), the mixer output is the\nfamiliar y(t) = x(t) \u00d7 c(t) = Ic sin2 (\u03c9c t) = Ic 1\u2212cos2 2\u03c9c t .\nThe LPF averages the second term to zero, so that the\ndemodulator baseband output is z(t) = Ic /2.\nThe x(t), c(t), y(t), and z(t) waveforms are shown\nfor this special case of a square-wave mixer in Figure 16\n(right). The reference is an on-resonance, in-phase, unit\namplitude square wave c(t). The output is a baseband\nsignal with amplitude equal to the average of a rectified\nsine wave, \u03c02 Ic . If the phase of the reference differs from\nthe sinusoid phase by \u03c6ref , the amplitude of the baseband output signal z(t) = \u03c02 Ic cos \u03c6ref , meaning that the\nresponse function is \u03c02 for in-phase I demodulation and\nzero for Q.\nFigure 17 shows other demodulator input signals that\nare relevant for understanding the signal and noise transfer functions of the fMUX system. The first case (a)\ncorresponds to a bias carrier Ic sin \u03c9c t, \u03c9c \u001d \u03c9LPF modulated by a small sky signal Is cos \u03c9s t, \u03c9s \u001c \u03c9LPF , yielding a demodulator input signal\nx(t) =\n=\n\n(Ic + Is cos \u03c9s t) sin \u03c9c t\n(A7)\nIs\nIc sin \u03c9c t + [sin(\u03c9c + \u03c9s ) + sin(\u03c9c \u2212 \u03c9s )] .\n2\n\nThis corresponds to the amplitude modulation produced\nby a power signal discussed in the first part of this Ap-\n\nFIG. 17: Frequency-domain representations of (a) a modulation of carrier amplitude Ic with a signal of amplitude Is , (b)\nan uncorrelated sinusoid with amplitude Itest adjacent to carrier amplitude Ic , (c) narrow-band white noise with amplitude\ninoise superimposed at frequencies surrounding carrier amplitude Ic , and (d) broadband white noise with amplitude inoise\nsuperimposed on carrier amplitude Ic . A fifth case, where\nnarrow-band white noise modulates the carrier (as would be\nthe case for bolometer phonon or photon noise) is not shown.\n\npendix; and arises from sky signals, bolometer phonon\nnoise, and bolometer photon noise. The sky signal is\nsplit into correlated sidebands adjacent to the carrier and\nappears in the demodulated timestream with amplitude\nz(t) = \u03c02 Is cos \u03c6ref cos \u03c9s t.\nCase (b) in Figure 17 corresponds to an off-resonance\nsinusoid It sin \u03c9t t injected adjacent to the carrier. For\nsimplicity, this test sinusoid is assumed to be injected after the bolometer so that the sinusoid does not deposit\npower in the bolometer that would be subject to ETF.\nThe test sinusoid beats with the carrier so that the demodulated signal is z(t) = 12 It cos \u03c6ref sin |\u03c9t \u2212 \u03c9c |t for\na sine-wave mixer and z(t) = \u03c02 It cos \u03c6ref sin |\u03c9t \u2212 \u03c9c |t\nfor a square-wave mixer. Notice that the test signal\nhas the same demodulation attenuation factor as an onresonance amplitude modulated signal. Test signals of\nthis type are used extensively in the fMUX system for\nmeasuring electronics transfer functions and characterising detectors.\nThe situation for white noise added to the carrier waveform (i.e., does not amplitude-modulate the carrier) requires special attention, because it differs from noise\nthat amplitude modulates the carrier and because the\nsquare-wave mixer responds differently to broadband and\nnarrow-band noise sources.\nCase (c) in Figure 17 corresponds to bandwidth limited white noise \u221a\nadjacent to the carrier with amplitude\nx(t) = inoise [A/ Hz]. An example would be Johnson\nnoise from a resistor in an LCR notch filter (or from\na normal bolometer in our fMUX circuit, though ETF\ncomplicates the situation for a bolometer in transition,\nsuppressing this noise). A single sideband can be decomposed into sinusoids, and hence has the same response\nfunction as case (b). There are, however, contributions\nfrom the sidebands on either side of the carrier, each\n\n\f24\nc(t) =Square-wave reference c(t) = sin(\u03c9c t) reference\nInput Signal x(t)\n\nI\n\nSinusoidal carrier\n\n2\nI\n\u03c0 c\n2(Ic +Is cos \u03c9s t)\n\u03c0\n\nAmplitude modulated carrier (a)\nSinusoidal test signal (b)\n\nIc sin \u03c9c t\n(Ic + Is cos \u03c9s t) sin \u03c9c t\nIt sin \u03c9t t, \u03c9t 6= \u03c9d\n\nSuperimposed narrowband white noise (c)\n\nn(t)\n\nSuperimposed broadband white noise (d)\n\nn(t)\n\n\u2020 \u03c02 It\n\nQ\n\nI\n\nQ\n\n0\n\n1\nI\n2 c\nIc +Is cos \u03c9s t\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\nsin(\u03c9t \u2212 \u03c9c )t\n2\n\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n\n2\n\nn(t)\n\nn(t)\n\n\u2020 12 It\n\n0\n\nsin(\u03c9t \u2212 \u03c9c )t\n\u221a\n\n2\nn(t)\n2\n\u221a\n2\nn(t)\n2\n\nTABLE III: Demodulator response factors are tabulated for various signal and noise types including those shown in panels\n(a) through (d) of Figure 17. \u03c9c is the demodulator\n\u221a reference frequency. Notice that white noise that is superimposed on the\ncarrier (not amplitude modulated) has a factor 2 enhancement over amplitude modulated signals. For the case of a square\nmixer and broadband white noise, the factor is \u03c02 because noise located within the LPF bandwidth of the reference signal's odd\nharmonics also contribute.\n\u2020 An arbitrary phase which depends on the start time is omitted from these equations.\n\ncontributing the same power. The two sidebands\nare un\u221a\ncorrelated with one another, resulting\u221ain a 2 enhancement, for a total contribution z(t) = 22 inoise for a sine\u221a\nwave mixer and z(t) = 2 \u03c0 2 inoise for a square-wave mixer.\nThere is no dependence on \u03c6ref since this input signal is\nnot coherent. The end result is that the sky-signal to\nnarrow-band noise ratio is the same for a TES read out\nthrough a square-wave mixer and a sine-wave mixer, and\nequivalent to what would be obtained for a TES with a\nstatic bias.\nCase (d) in Figure 17 corresponds\nto broadband white\n\u221a\nnoise with amplitude inoise [A/ Hz]. An example would\nbe SQUID noise or readout electronics noise. For a sinewave mixer, the response is identical to that of case (c).\nFor a square-wave mixer, both the noise power adjacent\nto the carrier and the noise power adjacent to the oddharmonics of the carrier contribute. This is immediately\nevident by examining the frequency-space representation\nof the square-wave, with includes delta functions at all of\nthe odd-harmonics that fall in amplitude as 1/n. Since\n\nthe noise waveform is characterized by random phase and\nthe square-wave mixer simply rotates the phase of half\nthe time samples by 180\u25e6 , it is easy to see that the demodulated amplitude will be unchanged, z(t) = inoise .\nWe note that the demodulated amplitude of broadband\nnoise can be reduced to that of case (c) if the carriers\nspan less than 2 octaves by placing a low-pass filter in\nfront of the mixer, removing input from the 3rd harmonics. The end result is that the sky-signal to narrow-band\nnoise ratio is the same for a a TES readout out through a\nsquare-wave mixer and a sine-wave mixer, and equivalent\nto what would be obtained for a TES with a static bias.\nThe end result is that\n\u221a the sky-signal to broadband noise\nratio is (2/\u03c0)/(1/ 2) ' 0.90 worse for a TES read out\nthrough a square-wave mixer as compared to a sine-wave\nmixer. The latter is equivalent to what would be obtained for a TES with a static bias. Typically for fMUX\nreadout, the contribution from broadband noise sources\nis small, and this difference is negligible.\n\n[1] D. S. Swetz, P. A. R. Ade, M. Amiri, J. W. Appel, E.
