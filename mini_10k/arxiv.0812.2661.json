Consequently, EIT systems can\nfunction as high-speed optically addressed spatial light modulators. To exemplify our proposal,\nwe indicate the generation and manipulation of Laguerre-Gaussian beams based on either phase\nor amplitude modulation in hot vapor EIT systems.\n\n1\n\n\fSpatial light modulator (SLM) technology plays a significant role in modern optics [1].\nThis technology can impose phase and amplitude modulations on light fields in real time,\nthus performing spatial information encoding and producing light fields with novel spatial\nstructures. In optics, Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes with isolated intensity minima in\ntheir transverse pofiles have attracted a great deal of interest [2, 3]. Numerous reseach has\nshown that LG modes carry well-defined orbital angular momentum which can impart on\nmatter through light-matter interaction or characterize multidimensional quantum states of\nlight in Hilbert space. Therefore, LG beams have promising applications in optical tweezers\nand traps [4, 5], dense coding in quantum information processing [6, 7]. etc. To generate\nand manipulate LG beams, programmable liquid crystal SLMs are increasingly adopted\n[3, 4, 5, 6]. Limited by the inertia of liquid crystal molecules, the refresh rates of liquid\ncrystal SLMs are at most a few kHz. However, for many applications based on LG beams,\nsuch as dynamic optical traps and large capacity parallel information processing, much faster\nreshaping of light fields is expected. Thus, liquid crystal SLMs could pose a real difficulty\nto the applications.\nElectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), as a phenomenon of quantum interference, has been intensively studied for decades [8]. In EIT systems, the dispersion and\nabsorption of weak probe light fields can be coherently controlled by strong coupling light\nfields via atomic transitions. Moreover, the atomic response time to the light fields could be\nmuch shorter than that of the liquid crystal molecules [9, 10]. Consequently, the phase and\namplitude of the probe fields could be modulated all-optically and quickly in the EIT media. Previously, EIT systems were widely used to manipulate light fields without transverse\nstructures [11], while some recent studies have focused on processing multimode transverse\nimages in EIT systems, particularly, in low-cost vapor cells [12]. Therefore, EIT systems\nmight also be a good candidate to perform spatial light modulation with high speed.\nIn this paper we examine the possibility of spatially modulating probe light beams in EIT\nsystems with the use of optical patterns (e.g. images) with desired intensity distributions in\nthe strong coupling fields. As an example, the generation and manipulation of LG beams\nare investigated. In our scheme, we consider a three-level \u039b atomic system interacting with\ntwo copropagating light fields in a hot vapor cell (Fig. 1), which can strongly suppress the\nDoppler broadening. The weak probe field of frequency \u03c9p and amplitude Ep is resonant with\nthe transition |1i \u2194 |3i (\u03c931 = \u03c9p ).

(c) Azimuthal intensity distribution of the coupling field to\ngenerate the LG beam with l = 1, where \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle. The intensity distribution could\nbe shown numerically in Fig. 2(a). (d) l = 2. (e) Possible experimental setup which includes an\nimaging system, a vapor cell of the thickness d and some beam splitters.\n\nEc drives the transition |2i \u2194 |3i with a small single-photon detuning \u2206 = \u03c932 \u2212 \u03c9c . The\nRabi frequencies of the probe and coupling fields are defined as \u03a9p,c = \u03bc13,23 * Ep,c /~, where\n\u03bc13,23 are the dipole moments of the transitions and \u03a9p \u226a \u03a9c for the EIT situation. Thus,\nignoring the Doppler broadening, the linear susceptibility for the probe field can be given\nby [8]\n\n\u03c7 = \u03c7\u2032 + i\u03c7\u2032\u2032 = |\u03bc13 |2 \u033a \u00d7\n2\n\n2\n\n(1)\n2\n\n\u22124\u2206|\u03a9c | + i8\u2206 \u03b331 + i2\u03b321 (|\u03a9c | + \u03b321 \u03b331 )\n\u01eb0 ~||\u03a9c |2 + \u03b331 (\u03b321 \u2212 i2\u2206)|\n\n2\n\n,\n\nwhere \u033a is the the atom number density, \u03b331 is the decay rate from |3i to |1i and \u03b321 is the\ndecoherence rate between |1i and |2i.\nTo generate LG modes by means of phase modulation, an azimuthal phase winding\n3\n\n\feil\u03c6 should be imprinted onto the wave front of the Gaussian probe field, where l is the\ninteger winding number and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle [4]. This phase imprinting requires an\nazimuthal variation of the refractive index n(\u03c6) in the EIT system, which can be produced\nby an azimuthally dependent Rabi frequency \u03a9c (\u03c6) of the coupling field according to Eq.\n(1). Intuitively, this coupling field can be constructed by the images of amplitude masks in\nan imaging system [Fig. 1(b)-(e)]. To numerically evaluate this scheme, three sublevels in\nthe\n\n87\n\nRb D2 line (52 S1/2 \u2194 52 P3/2 , \u03bb = 780 nm) are adopted, which can reasonably give\n\n\u03b331 = 38.11 \u00d7 106 /s, \u03bc13 = \u03bc23 = 3.58 \u00d7 10\u221229 C*m, \u03b321 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 3000/s, \u2206 = \u22120.2\u03b331 ,\n\n\u033a = 5 \u00d7 1012 /cm3 [13]. From Eq. (1), the Rabi frequency of the coupling field can have the\nform\n\u03bc23 * Ec (\u03c6)\n\u03a9c (\u03c6) =\n=\n~\n\nr\n\na\n\u03b331 ,\nb\u03c6 + c\n\n(2)\n\nto introduce the azimuthal dependence of \u03c7, where a, b, and c are the adjustable parameters.\nWhen the strong-coupling-field condition \u03a9c (\u03c6) \u226b {\u03b331 , \u2206} \u226b \u03b321 are satisfied, Eqs. (1) and\n\n(2) give \u03c7\u2032 \u221d \u2212\u2206/\u03a92c \u221d \u03c6 and \u03c7\u2032\u2032 \u221d \u03b321 /\u03a92c \u2192 0 which tell us that the refractive index can\nvary almost linearly around the optical axis [the z axis in Fig. 1(e)] and the absorption can\nsimultaneously be suppressed. For simplicity, we discuss here the generation of LG mode\nwith l = 1 from the Gaussion probe field with l = 0. A 2\u03c0 phase difference between the\nmaximum and minimum should be imprinted onto the wave front of the probe field, which\ncan result in\n\u2206n * d = [n(2\u03c0) \u2212 n(0)] * d = \u2206l * \u03bb,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere n is the refractive index, d is the thickness of the vapor cell and \u2206l = 1. It is known\nthat, in EIT systems, \u03c7\u2032 and \u03c7\u2032\u2032 are much smaller than unity (\u03c7\u2032 , \u03c7\u2032\u2032 \u226a 1), which can lead to\n\u221a\nn = 1 + \u03c7 \u2248 1 + \u03c7\u2032 /2 + i\u03c7\u2032\u2032 /2. Thus, Eq. (3) can be rewritten as [\u03c7\u2032 (2\u03c0) \u2212 \u03c7\u2032 (0)] * d = 2\u03bb.\nMoreover, the transmission probability can read T = e\u2212\u03b1d , where the absorption coefficient\n\u03b1 = 2\u03c0\u03c7\u2032\u2032 /\u03bb. Assuming a = 500, b = c = 1 for the strong-coupling-field condition which\ncan give \u03a9c (\u03c6) \u2248 10\u03b331 , and with the parameters in\n\n87\n\nRb, one can find the thickness of\n\nthe vapor cell d \u2248 862 \u03bcm and other features shown in Fig. 2. According to Eq. (3),\nthe 2\u03c0 phase modulation can thus be reached in a very thin cell, which is crucial to our\nscheme, because (i) the thin cell can lead to high resolution images through the EIT system\nand the alignment between the probe field and the images, (ii) it can further reduce the\n4\n\n\fabsorption of the system [T > 90% in Fig. 2(a)], (iii) it can ensure the validity of the\nparaxial approximation and nearly phase-only operations [4, 14]. Additionally, high order\nLG modes can be created by more complex images, such as in Fig. 1(d).\n1\n\n100\n0.002\n\n90\n\nTransmission\n\u0399ntensity\n\n0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\u03c0\n3\u03c0/2\nAzim. angle \u03c6\n\n\u03c7\u2032 and \u03c7\u2032\u2032\n\n0.5\n\nT(\u03c6) (%)\n\nI(\u03c6) (W/cm2)\n\n(a)\n\n80\n\n(b)\n\n\u03c7\u2032\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 100\n\n0.001\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0\n3\u03c0/2\nAzim. angle \u03c6\n\n2\u03c0\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) (a) Azimuthal intensity distribution I(\u03c6) (= \u01eb0 cEc (\u03c6)2 /2) of the coupling\nfield (solid) corresponding to Fig. 1(c) with a = 500, b = c = 1 in Eq. (2), where I(0) = 838\nmW/cm2 and I(2\u03c0) = 115 mW/cm2 . According to Eqs. (1), (2) and the strong-coupling-field\ncondition, this azimuthal intensity distribution of the coupling field can induce an azimuthally\ndependent refractive index and a small absorption for the probe field. Thus, also shown is the high\ntransmission probability T (\u03c6) > 90% of the probe field (dashed).

The real part \u03c7\u2032 (solid)\n\nis associated with the azimuthally dependent refractive index and the imaginary part \u03c7\u2032\u2032 (dashed)\nis associated with the small absorption.\n\nThe switching between different LG modes (e.g. between l = 0 and l = 1) is essentially associated with the conversion between different dark states in the EIT system. The\nswitching time depends on the following factors. The first one is the time scale for the reestablishment of dark states, which can be given by \u03c4r \u2248 \u03b1d\u03b331/\u03a92c [9, 10]. Suppose that we\nhave the initial image in Fig. 1(c) with the intensity distribution numerically shown in Fig.\n2(a), then switch this image to a uniform illumination [Fig. 1(b)] with Iuni = I(0) = 838\nmW/cm2 . It can be seen that the weakest coupling intensity occurs at \u03c6 = 2\u03c0 where the\nsystem has the highest absorption and, accordingly, the longest re-establishment time. We\ncan find \u03c4r \u2248 \u03b1d\u03b331/\u03a92uni \u2248 34 ps at \u03c6 = 2\u03c0, where \u03a9uni is the Rabi frequency of the uniform\nillumination. Secondly, an adiabatic manipulation should be performed to keep the coherence of the system. The time scale can be given by \u03c4a = \u03b331 /\u03a92uni \u2248 0.33 ns [8, 15]. Hence,\n5\n\n\fthe limit for the switching time is \u03c4s \u226b \u03c4r , \u03c4a , which shows the possibility of modulation at\nup to a fraction of GHz.\nNext, we consider the generation of LG modes by means of amplitude modulation. In this\ncase, the aforementioned images with azimuthal intensity distributions should be replaced by\nimages with forked binary patterns (Fig. 3) [16, 17]. Furthermore, we use the resonant threelevel EIT system without detunings (\u2206 = 0). In the bright fringes of the forked coupling\nfield, the probe field can transmit with very low absorption under the EIT condition (T \u2192 1).\nNevertheless, in the dark fringes without the coupling intensity (\u03a9c = 0), the probe field\nresonantly drives the transition |1i \u2194 |3i, which can result in a strong absorption. From\nEq. (1) with \u2206 = \u03a9c = 0, we can obtain\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032 =\n\n2\u03bc212 \u033a\n\u2248 0.0072, \u21d2 T = e\u2212\u03b1d \u2248 e\u221229 \u2192 0,\n\u01eb0 ~\u03b331\n\n(4)\n\nwhere we use d = 500 \u03bcm for the thin cell condition and \u033a = 1011 cm\u22123 , and preserve all\nthe other parameters in\n\n87\n\nRb. Thus, a tunable forked binary amplitude grating is formed in\n\nthe EIT system for the probe field. The transmission function of this grating can be given\nby [17]\n\u221e\n\n1 2X 1\n\u00d7\ntf (r, \u03c6) = +\n2 \u03c0 k=0 2k + 1\nsin[(2k + 1)(\u2212l\u03c6 +\nwhere r =\n\np\n\n2\u03c0\nr cos \u03c6)],\nD\n\n(5)\n\nx2 + y 2, \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle, l is the winding number and D is the period\n\nof the grating far away from the forked center. The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern can be\nanalytically derived and show that, the beams diffracted into the first order maxima of the\npattern can be converted into the LG modes with the \u00b1l winding numbers [17].\nTo switch the LG modes (e.g. between l = 0 and l = 1), we can switch the coupling\nfields between the uniform illumination [Fig. 1(b)] and the forked grating [Fig. 3(a)].\nAt the positions of the dark fringes, there should be a switching between the two-level\nresonant system and the three-level EIT system. Using the same methods mentioned above\n[8, 9, 10, 15] and assuming that the bright fringes and the uniform illumination have the\nsame intensity (e.g. Ibf = Iuni = 838 mW/cm2 ), we can calculate the re-establishment time\n\u03c4r \u2248 9.56 ns and the time scale for the adiabatic approximation \u03c4a \u2248 0.33 ns. The limit for\nthe switching time (\u03c4s \u226b \u03c4r , \u03c4a ) shows that the modulation can be performed at up to many\nMHz.\n6\n\n\fl = \u00b11 y\n\nl = \u00b12\n\n\u03c6\nx\n\n(a)\n\nD\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 3: (a) Forked binary amplitude grating to generate the LG modes with l = \u00b11, where \u03c6 is\nthe azimuthal angle and D is the period of the grating far away from the forked center. (b) Similar\ngrating for l = \u00b12.\n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that LG modes can be generated and manipulated\nin low-cost hot vapor EIT systems with high speed. Since 2\u03c0 phase modulation with low\nabsorption or binary amplitude modulation can be easily obtained in EIT systems by using\nimages with the desired intensity distributions in the coupling fields, EIT systems can be\nused as high-speed low-cost optically addressed SLMs [1]. By employing more complex\nimages, one can achieve light fields with more peculiar spatial structures [18]. Our scheme\nprovides a flexible and practical way to realize the high-speed spatial light modulation in\nEIT systems with potential applications in optical technology and information science.\nWe would like to acknowledge funding from NSF.
