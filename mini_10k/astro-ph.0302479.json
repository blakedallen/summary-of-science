China.\nRecent fits of cosmological parameters by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)\nmeasurement favor a primordial scalar spectrum with varying index. This result, if stands, could\nseverely constrain inflation model buildings. Most extant slow-roll inflation models allow for only\na tiny amount of scale variations in the spectrum. We propose in this paper an extra-dimensional\ninflation model which is natural theoretically and can generate the required variations of the spectral\nindex as implied by the WMAP for suitable choices of parameters.\nPACS number(s): 98.80.Cq, 11.10.Kk\n\nThe recently released Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy\nProbe (WMAP) data [1] have been used to fit the cosmological parameters and confront the predictions of inflationary scenarios respectively in Refs. 2 and 3. It\nis found that the data (with no other significant priors) can be best fitted by a standard \u039bCDM model\nseeded by an almost scale-invariant, adiabatic, Gaussian primordial fluctuation; predictions inferred from the\nmodel also agree with other cosmological measurements\nwith high accuracies[4]. It is noted that there might\nbe possible discrepancies between predictions and observations on the largest and smallest scales. The problem at the smallest scales is improved when combined\nwith data from finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR\nand CBI) and structure formation measurements (2dFGRS and Lyman \u03b1 forest), for which a varying scalar\nprimordial spectrum is favored by the best fit. At the\npivot scale k0 = 0.05 Mpc\u22121 , the best-fit values for\nthe scalar power spectrum are ns = 0.93 \u00b1 0.03 and\ndns /d ln k = \u22120.031+0.016\n\u22120.018 [2]; this means at a 2\u03c3 level\nthe spectrum runs from blue to red as the co-moving\nwave number k increases. As noted, the suppression of\nthe power at the smallest scale might offer an interesting\nsolution to the problem of the standard \u039bCDM model at\nsmall scales [7].\nThe intriguing result of a varying spectral index needs\nto be closely evaluated with improved statistics and with\nfuture data. If stands, it could severely constrain inflation model buildings. Most extant inflationary models\nallow for only a tiny amount of scale variations. In this\npaper we propose a single-field inflation model which is\nnatural theoretically and can generate the required variations of the spectral index as implied by the WMAP.\nFor the single-field slow-roll inflationary models, one\nusually defines the following slow-roll parameters [8],\n\u0012 \u00132\nMP2 V \u2032\nV \u2032\u2032\nV \u2032 V \u2032\u2032\u2032\n\u01eb\u2261\n, \u03b7 \u2261 MP2\n, (1)\n, \u03be \u2261 MP4\n2\nV\nV\nV2\nwhere primes represent derivatives with respect to the\ninflaton field, \u03c6, and MP = 2.4 \u00d7 1018 GeV is the reduced Planck mass. Slow-roll approximation requires\n\u01eb, |\u03b7|, |\u03be| \u226a 1 in the inflationary epoch.\n\nThe primordial curvature (scalar) and tensor perturbation power spectra are given by [8]\nPR \u2248\n\nV\n24\u03c0 2 MP4 \u01eb k=aH\n\n,\n\nPh \u2248\n\n2V\n3\u03c0 2 MP4\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nk=aH\n\nevaluated when a particular mode crosses out the horizon. The tensor to scalar ratio r \u2261 Ph /PR \u2248 16\u01eb is\ngenerally small in the slow-roll inflation. The spectral\nindices and their running are the slopes and curvatures\nof the power spectra. In terms of the slow-roll parameters, for scalar perturbations, they are\nns \u2212 1 \u2248 \u22126\u01eb + 2\u03b7,\n\ndns\n\u2248 16\u01eb\u03b7 \u2212 24\u01eb2 \u2212 2\u03be.\nd ln k\n\n(3)\n\nIn most inflationary models, \u01eb, |\u03b7| \u223c MP2 /(\u2206\u03c6)2 ,\n|\u03be| \u223c MP4 /(\u2206\u03c6)4 , and the number of e-folding N \u223c\n(\u2206\u03c6)2 /MP2 , where \u2206\u03c6 is the displacement of the homogeneous field \u03c6, so there is a hierarchy in the slow-roll\nparameters, \u01eb, |\u03b7| \u223c N \u22121 , |\u03be| \u223c N \u22122 , and the variations\nof the spectral indices, dns /d ln k, are negligible.\nTo achieve a running spectrum in the order favored by\nthe WMAP, one has to consider inflation models with\nmore exotic potentials [9], such as the running mass\nmodel [10] and models with oscillating primordial spectrum [11]. These models can generate significant spectral\nrunnings, which could be as large as ns \u2212 1.\nThe Achilles heel of these inflationary models (and\nof the inflation paradigm in general) lies, arguably, in\nthe difficulty of obtaining a sufficiently flat and stable\n(against radiative corrections) inflaton potential from the\nperspectives of particle physics. Symmetry principles\nmust be invoked. There are only two known symmetries which can protect the flatness of a scalar potential: supersymmetry and the shift symmetry for a Pseudo\nNambu-Goldstone Boson (PNGB). However, as shown in\nRef. 12 and recently re-emphasized in Refs. 13 and 14,\nsupersymmetry alone cannot protect the flatness of the\ninflaton potential, since it is explicitly broken during inflation, and the gravitational effects generically give a\nHubble-scale mass correction to the inflaton.\nThe shift symmetry was first realized in the natural inflation model [15]. Still there are some difficulties in this\n\n\f2\nmodel. The flatness condition, in the simplest scenario\nwith a single PNGB, requires the scale of spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking and the values of the inflaton during\nthe slow roll above the Planck scale, taking the model\noutside the regime of validity of an effective field theory\ndescription. Moreover, it is expected that the gravityinduced higher-dimensional operators are not suppressed.\nThese issues have been recently re-examined in the\ncontext of extra dimensions (called extra-natural inflation in Ref. 13). Consider a five-dimensional Abelian\ngauge field model with the fifth dimension compactified\non a circle of radius R, we identify the inflaton field \u03b8 with\nthe gauge-invariant Wilson loop of the extra component\nA5 propagating in the bulk,\nI\n\u03b8 = g5 dx5 A5 ,\n(4)\nwhere g5 is the five-dimensional gauge coupling constant.\nAt energies below 1/R, \u03b8 is a four-dimensional field with\nan effective Lagrangian\nL=\n\n1\n(\u2202\u03b8)2\n2\n2g4 (2\u03c0R)2\n\n\u2212 V (\u03b8) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwith g42 = g52 /2\u03c0R the four-dimensional effective gauge\ncoupling constant. The non-local potential V (\u03b8) is generated in the presence of particles charged under the\nAbelian symmetry [16].\nFor bulk fields with bare masses Ma and charges qa the\npotential takes the form [17]\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nF\nB\nV (\u03b8) =\nTr\nV\n(r\n,\n\u03b8)\n\u2212\nV\n(r\n,\n\u03b8)\n,\n(6)\na\na\n128\u03c0 6 R4\nwhere the trace is over the number of degrees of freedom,\nand the superscripts F and B stand for fermions and\nbosons respectively. Here\nV (ra , \u03b8) = x2a Li3 (ra e\u2212xa ) + 3xa Li4 (ra e\u2212xa )\n+ 3 Li5 (ra e\u2212xa ) + h.c. ,\n\n(7)\n\nra = eiqa \u03b8 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwith\nxa = 2\u03c0RMa ,\n\nNeglecting the higher power terms in Eq.

For \u03c3 = 0, this potential coincides with that of the natural inflation model.\nThe slow-roll parameters of Eq. (1) are\n\u01eb =\n\n\u03bc2 (sin \u03b8\u0303 + \u03c3\u03ba sin \u03ba\u03b8\u0303)2\n,\n2 [1 \u2212 cos \u03b8\u0303 \u2212 \u03c3 cos \u03ba\u03b8\u0303]2\n\n(15)\n\n(9)\n\nFor massless particles (xa = 0) considered in Ref. 13 the\npotential is\nV (\u03b8) = \u2212\n\n(11)\n\nwhich can be naturally greater than MP for a sufficiently small coupling constant g4 [13]. Moreover, due\nto the extra dimension nature, gravity-induced higherdimensional operators are generally exponentially suppressed. This solves the forementioned problems of the\nfour-dimensional natural inflation model1 . The extranatural model predicts a red-tilted scalar spectrum with\nnegligible spectral runnings, same as that of the natural\ninflation.\nThe model we propose in this paper includes one\nmassless and one massive fields2 coupled to A5 , i.e.,\nM1 = 0, M2 >\n\u223c 1/R, the corresponding potential for\n\u03b8 is\n\"\n\u221e\nX\ncos(nq1 \u03b8)\n1\n3\n(\u2212)F1\nV (\u03b8) = \u2212\n64\u03c0 6 R4 n=1 n3\nn2\n#\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nx\nx\n1\n2\n2\n+ (\u2212)F2 e\u2212nx2\n.\n+\n+ 2 cos(nq2 \u03b8) (12)\n3\nn\nn\n\nand the poly-logarithm function Lik (z) are\nLik (z) =\n\n1\n,\n2\u03c0g4 R\n\n(10)\n\n1\n\n2\n\nI\n\nwhere FI = 0 and 1 stand for massless bosonic and\nfermionic fields, respectively.\n\n3\n\nIf natural inflation model includes a large Z in the kinetic\nterm[18], redefining\nthe field gives rise to an effective decay con\u221a\nstant fef f = Zf , which ( as well as the inflaton field itself )\ncan also be larger than Mp , however a question remained is how\nto get a large Z naturally[19].\nMassive particles have also been considered in Ref. 20, in the\ncontext of extra-dimensional quintessence models.\nFor a specific presentation, we set F1 = 1. The F1 = 0 case is\nequivalent since it only corresponds to a co-ordinate shift in the\npotential.\n\n\f3\n\u03b7 =\n\n\u03bc2 (cos \u03b8\u0303 + \u03c3\u03ba2 cos \u03ba\u03b8\u0303)\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\n1 \u2212 cos \u03b8\u0303 \u2212 \u03c3 cos \u03ba\u03b8\u0303\n\u03bc4 (sin \u03b8\u0303 + \u03c3\u03ba sin \u03ba\u03b8\u0303)(sin \u03b8\u0303 + \u03c3\u03ba3 sin \u03ba\u03b8\u0303)\n, (17)\n\u03be = \u2212\n[1 \u2212 cos \u03b8\u0303 \u2212 \u03c3 cos \u03ba\u03b8\u0303]2\n\nwhere we have defined \u03b8\u0303 \u2261 q1 \u03b8 and\n\u03bc \u2261 q1 MP /feff ,\n\n\u03ba \u2261 q2 /q1 .\n\n(18)\n\nTo see analytically the effects of \u03c3 term, we consider\nthe following choice of parameters: \u03ba \u226b 1, \u03c3 \u226a 1, |\u03c3|\u03ba \u226a\n1 and |\u03c3|\u03ba2 \u223c O(1). When cosmological scales begin to\ncross out the horizon in the inflationary epoch, \u03b8\u0303 \u223c \u03c0,\nthe slow-roll parameters are approximately\n\u01eb \u223c \u03bc2 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303)2 ,\n\n\u03b7 \u223c \u03bc2 (\u22121 + \u03c3\u03ba2 cos \u03ba\u03b8\u0303) ,\n\u03be \u223c \u2212\u03bc4 \u03c3\u03ba3 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8\u0303) sin \u03ba\u03b8\u0303 .\n\n(19)\n(20)\n(21)\n\nHence \u01eb \u226a |\u03b7|. The spectral index is determined by the\n\u03b7 parameter, ns \u2212 1 \u2243 2\u03b7, and the tensor fluctuation is\nnegligible.\nFrom the above equations, one generically would have\n|\u03be| \u223c \u03b7 2 \u223c 10\u22124 , corresponding to a negligible spectral\nvariation. However, the large \u03c3\u03ba3 term in Eq. (21) can\nenhance \u03be substantially (to the size as large as \u03b7), and\nlead to a scale varying spectrum. Furthermore, for appropriate choices of \u03c3 and \u03ba, the scalar power spectrum\ncan run from blue to red as the co-moving scale k increases. Such a tilted spectrum is favored by the current\ndata of WMAP [2].\n\n\u22123.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 , \u03bc = 1/2 and \u03ba = 100 (solid lines), and (b)\n\u03c3 = 0.012, \u03bc = 1/3, \u03ba = 15 (dashed lines). To ensure\nthe accuracy of our results, we have retained the higher\npower terms (up to n = 6 for the massless particle) in the\nnumerical calculations. We have also set the number of efolding N (k\u2217 ) = 50 at a reference co-moving scale k\u2217 ; the\nWMAP analyses used pivot scales k0 = 0.002 and 0.05\nMpc\u22121 [2, 3]. (This scale arbitrariness is the inherent\ntheoretical uncertainty in our analysis; it can be resolved\nif the detail reheating history is known [21].) Normalizing\nthe spectral index to the WMAP central value ns = 1.1\nat k0 = 0.002 Mpc\u22121 [3], we find dns /d ln k \u2248 \u22120.041 and\n\u2248 \u22120.021 for case (a) and (b) respectively; they are in\ngood agreements with the current WMAP fits [2, 3].

We have normalized the spectral index ns = 1.13 at the same pivot\nscale k0 . We show allowed regions in the \u03ba-\u03c3 plane, for\n\u03bc = 1/3. The correlation between \u03ba and \u03c3 can be understood because one needs a certain amount of cancellations between the two terms in Eq. (20) (to achieve a\nspectral running from blue to red).\nIn our models the size of the fifth dimension is determined to be of the order R \u223c 10/MP from the COBE nor1/2\nmalization, PR \u223c 10\u22125 . For our choices of parameters,\n\u03bc \u223c 0.1, this implies the four- and five-dimensional gauge\n\u22123\n2 <\n\u22124 2\ncoupling constants g4 <\n\u223c 10 /q1 , g5 \u223c 10 /q1 MP .\nThese parameter choices could be accommodated in\nmodels of fundamental theories. For example, string\ntheory predicts a host of exotic particles with fractional\n\n\f4\ncharges; one can obtain large charge ratios of the massive to massless particles (\u03ba \u223c 10-100) as required in\nour models. The massive particle has a mass of the order M2 \u223c O(1)R\u22121 , falls in the range of massive string\nstates. It remains to be seen whether this kind of model\ncan arise naturally from specific string models.\n\u22123\nThe small gauge coupling constant (g4 <\n\u223c 10 when\nq1 \u223c O(1)) might seem worrisome, since string theory\ncompactification generally requires g4 MP R >\n\u223c 1 [13].\nThis problem can be improved by introducing many\nAbelian gauge fields in higher dimensions as in the assisted inflation model [22]. For a system with N Wilson\nloops \u03b8i , the Lagrangian is given by\nL=\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\nN\nX\n1\n2\nV (\u03b8i ) .\n(\u2202\u03b8\n)\n\u2212\ni\n2g42 (2\u03c0R)2\ni=1\n\n(22)\n\nThis system has a solution where all the \u03b8i fields are\nequal, consequently it can be described\u221aby a single-field\nmodel through the redefinitions, feeff = N /2\u03c0g4 R, Ve =\nN Vi . The COBE normalization gives RN \u22121/4 \u223c 10MP\u22121,\n\u22123 1/4\nwhich implies g4 <\n\u223c 10 N . The above requirement\ncan be naturally satisfied if N >\n\u223c 100.\n\nBest fit P\u039b CD model\n\n6000\n\nBest fit R\u039b CD model\nDouble natural inflation\n\n2\n\n(l+1)/(2\u03c0 ) Cl (\u03bc \u039a )\n\n5000\n\nTT\n\n4000\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nMultipole l\n\nFIG. 3: Suppression of CMB quadrupole in the double natural\ninflation model. The CMB data with error bars are taken\nfrom WMAP collaborations[2].\n\nBefore concluding, we comment on the possible discrepancy between predictions and COBE[23], WMAP\nobservations on the largest scales[2, 24]. As argued in\nRef. 5, the need of large running is due to the suppressed\nmultipoles at l = 2, 3, 4. However as shown in Ref. 2 the\npossibility of finding a lower value of quadrupole in the\npresence of a constant running of the spectral index is no\nmore than 0.9 percent for a spacial flat \u039bCDM cosmology. In our model, the running index dns /d ln k is not a\nconstant, but we have checked that it does not improve\n\nthe fit significantly. With many Abelian gauge fields in\nthe higher dimensions, we will show now this discrepancy\ncan be alleviated. For simplicity of our discussion, consider two Wilson lines \u03b81 and \u03b82 , the Lagrangian for such\na system is given by\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nq1 \u03c61\n1\n1\n2\n2\nL = (\u2202\u03c61 ) + (\u2202\u03c62 ) \u2212 V0 1 \u2212 cos\n2\n2\nfeff\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\nq2 \u03c62\n.\n(23)\n\u2212 V0 1 \u2212 cos\nfeff\nAssuming adiabatic process with certain choice of parameters, e.g., q1 = 5q2 , inflation will be firstly driven by\nthe heavy field \u03c61 and then by \u03c62 , with no interruption\nin between. The \"double natural inflation\" can generate a primordial spectrum with a feature at the largest\nscales favored by current data. In Fig. 3 we give an\nexample with q1 = 5 and q2 = 1. The details of our\ncalculations is similar to Ref. 25: we numerically calculate the primordial scalar and tensor spectra and fit the\nresulting CMB TT and TE spectra using WMAP likelihood code[26] with CMBfast program [27]. We compare\nour result with WMAP team's best fit power law \u039bCDM\n(P\u039bCDM) and running spectral index \u039bCDM (R\u039bCDM)\nmodel. The CMB quadrupole as shown in Fig. 3 is better\nsuppressed in this model.\nIn summary, the WMAP result of a varying spectral\nindex, if stands, could be used as a discriminator for\ninflationary models; most extant models allow for only\na tiny amount of scale variations in the spectral index\nand could face a severe challenge. We have studied in\nthis paper the possibility of building inflation models\nwith large running spectral indices, and specifically proposed a higher-dimensional model which can generate\ndn/d ln k \u223c \u2212O(10\u22122 ), favored by the WMAP analyses.\nAcknowledgments: This work was supported in part\nby National Natural Science Foundation of China and by\nMinistry of Science and Technology of China under Grant\nNo. NKBRSF G19990754, and in part by an NSF grant\nNSF-0070928.\n\n[1] C.
