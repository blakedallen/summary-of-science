In fact, when studying the model theory of a complete theory T , one may work in a large saturated\nmodel of T with its definable sets, and forget everything else about T . This large saturated structure is sometimes called the \"universal domain\", sometimes the \"monster model\".\nA significant work has been done the last twenty years on the automorphism\ngroups of saturated models. It is this work that I want to review here. There is\na central question that I will use as a \"main theme\" to organize the paper: what\ninformation about M and its theory are contained in its group of automorphisms?\nIn the best case, M itself is \"encoded\" in some way in this group; recovering M from\nit is known as \"the reconstruction problem\". A possible answer to this problem is a\ntheorem of the form: If M1 and M2 are structures in a given class with isomorphic\nautomorphism groups, then M1 and M2 are isomorphic.\nThroughout this paper, T is supposed to be a countable complete theory. The\ncountability of T is by no means an essential hypothesis. Its purpose is only to\nmake the exposition smoother, and most of the results generalize without difficulty\n\u2217 CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Denis Diderot Paris 7, 2 Place Jussieu, UFR de math\u00e9matiques, case 7012,\n75521 Paris Cedex 05, France.

We will denote by Aut(M ) the group of automorphisms of\nthe structure M , and if A is a subset of M , AutA (M ) will be the pointwise stabilizer\nof A:\nAutA (M ) = {f \u2208 Aut(M ) ; \u2200a \u2208 A f (a) = a} .\nWhen we say \"definable\", we mean \"definable without parameters\".\n\n2.\n\nThe countable case\n\nAs a preliminary remark, let us say that the automorphism group of a saturated\nmodel is always very rich: if M has cardinality \u03bb, then its automorphism group has\ncardinality 2\u03bb .\nI do not know who was the first to introduce the small index property. As we\nwill see, it is crucial in the subject.\nDefinition 1 Let M be a countable structure. We say that M (or Aut(M )) has\nthe small index property if for any subgroup H of Aut(M ) of index less than 2\u05d00 ,\nthere exists a finite set A \u2282 M such that AutA (M ) \u2286 H.\nRemark that the converse is true: any subgroup containing a subgroup of the\nform AutA (M ) where A is finite, has a countable index in Aut(M ). Moreover,\nthe subgroups containing a subgroup of the form AutA (M ) are precisely the open\nneighborhoods of the identity for the pointwise convergence topology. In other\nwords, the small index property allows us to recover the topological structure of\nAut(M ) from its pure group structure.\nThe small index property has been proved for a number of countable saturated\nstructures:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n\nThe infinite set without additional structure [23], [5].\nThe linear densely ordered sets [25].\nThe vector spaces over a finite field [6].\nThe random graph [10].\nVarious other classes of graphs [9].\nGeneric relational structures [8].\n\u03c9-categorical \u03c9-stable structures [10].\n\nThe small index property has also been proved for some countable structures\nwhich are not saturated: for the free group with \u03c9-generators ([2]), for arithmetically\nsaturated models of arithmetic ([17]).\nThere are examples of countable saturated structures which fail to have the\nsmall index property. The simplest may be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 of infinite countable transcendence degree: Let Q\u0304 be the algebraic closure\nof the field of rational numbers. There is an obvious homomorphism \u03c6 from Aut(M )\nonto Aut(Q\u0304) (the restriction map). Now, it is well known that there is a subgroup\nH of Aut(Q\u0304) of countable index (in fact of finite index) which is not closed for the\nKrull topology, which is nothing else that the pointwise convergence topology. Then\n\u03c6\u22121 (H) is not open, but of finite index in Aut(M ).\n\n\fAutomorphism Groups of Saturated Structures\n\n27\n\nAs we will see later, the small index property is particularly relevant for \u03c9categorical structures. Evans and Hewitt have produced an example of such a structure without the small index property ([7]).\nWith the pointwise convergence topology, Aut(M ) is a topological polish\ngroup. So, we may use the powerful tools of descriptive set theory. In many cases\n(for example for structures 1-6 above), it can be shown that there is a (necessarily\nunique) conjugacy class which is generic, that is, is the countable intersection of\ndense open subsets. The elements of this class are called generic automorphisms,\nand they play an important role in the proof of the small index property.\nAnother possible nice property of these automorphism groups which is sometimes obtained as a bonus of the proof of the small index property, is the fact that\nits cofinality is not countable, that is, Aut(M ) is not the union of a countable chain\nof proper subgroups. This is proved in particular for the full permutation group of a\ncountable set ([21]), for the random graph and for \u03c9-categorical \u03c9-stable structures\n([10]).\nI would like to mention here the work of Rubin ([24]). He has shown how to\nreconstruct a certain number of structures from their automorphism group using a\nsomewhat different method. His methods apply essentially to \"combinatorial structures\" such as the random graph, the universal homogeneous poset, the generic\ntournament (a structure for which the small index property is not known), etc.\n\n3.\n\nSubgroups and imaginary elements\n\nRecall that an imaginary element of M is a class of a tuple of M n modulo a\ndefinable equivalence relation on M n . For instance, if G is a group and H a definable\nsubgroup of Gn , then any coset of H in Gn is an imaginary element. When we add\nall these imaginary elements to a saturated structure M , we obtain the structure\nM eq , and we can consider M eq as a saturated structure (in a larger language).\nIt is clear that M and M eq have canonically the same automorphism group:\nevery automorphism of M extends uniquely to an automorphism of M eq . This\nshows a limitation to the reconstruction problem: If M and N are two structures\nwhich are such that \"M eq and N eq are isomorphic\", then Aut(M ) and Aut(N )\nare isomorphic via a bicontinuous isomorphism. The condition \"M eq and N eq are\nisomorphic\" may seem weird, but in fact, it is natural. Roughly speaking, it means\nthat M can be interpreted in N , and conversely (a little more in fact, see [1] for\nmore details). In this case, we say that M and N are bi-interpretable.\nConsider now the case of an \u03c9-categorical structure M . It is not difficult to\nsee that any open subgroup of Aut(M ) is the stabilizer Aut\u03b1 (M ) of an imaginary\nelement \u03b1. Moreover, Aut(M ) acts by conjugation on the set of its open subgroups,\nand this action is (almost) isomorphic to the action of Aut(M ) on M eq (almost\nbecause two different imaginary elements \u03b1 and \u03b2 may have the same stabilizer).\nSo, from the topological group Aut(M ) we can (almost) reconstruct its action on\nM eq . We can do better:\nTheorem 2 [1] Assume that M and N are countable \u03c9-categorical structures. Then\nthe following two conditions are equivalent:\n\n\f28\n\nD. Lascar\n\n1. there is a bicontinuous isomorphism from Aut(M ) onto Aut(N );\n2. M and N are bi-interpretable.\nIn fact, these conditions are also equivalent to: there exists a continuous isomorphism from Aut(M ) onto Aut(N ) (see [15]). Thus, if one of the structure M\nor N has the small index property and Aut(M ) is isomorphic to Aut(N ) (as pure\ngroups), then M and N are bi-interpretable.\nNow, if M is not necessarily \u03c9-categorical (but still saturated), the situation\nis a bit more complicated. We need to introduce new elements.\nDefinition 3 1. An ultra-imaginary element of M is a class modulo E, where E\nis an equivalence relation on M n (n \u2264 \u03c9) which is invariant under the action of\nAut(M ). An ultra-imaginary element is finitary if n < \u03c9.\n2. A hyperimaginary element of M is a class modulo E, where E is an equivalence\nrelation on M n (n \u2264 \u03c9) which is defined by a (possibly infinite) conjunction of first\norder formulas.\nAn imaginary element is hyperimaginary, and a hyperimaginary element is\nultra-imaginary. A hyperimaginary element is a class modulo an equivalence relation\nE defined by a formula of the form\n^\n\u03c6i\ni\u2208I\n\nwhere the \u03c6i are first-order formulas (without parameters) and whose free variables\nare among the xk for k < n. An ultra-imaginary element is a class modulo an\nequivalence relation E defined by a formula of the form\n_^\n\u03c6i,j\nj\u2208J i\u2208I\n\nwhere the \u03c6i,j are first order-formulas (without parameters) and whose free variables\nare among the xk for k < n.\nIf M is a countable saturated structure, the stabilizer of a finitary ultraimaginary element is clearly an open subgroup, and it is not difficult to see that\nif H an open subgroup of Aut(M ), then there exists a finitary ultra-imaginary element \u03b1 such that H is the stabilizer of \u03b1. In the \u03c9-categorical case, any finitary\nultra-imaginary is in fact imaginary, and this explain why this case is so simple.\nIn some cases, for example for \u03c9-stable theories (see [18]), it is possible to\ncharacterize, among all open subgroups, those which are of the form Aut\u03b1 (M )\nwith \u03b1 imaginary. Something similar has been done for countable arithmetically\nsaturated models of arithmetic in [11], and in [13], it is proved that if two such\nmodels have isomorphic automorphism groups, then they are isomorphic.\n\n4.\n\nStrong automorphisms\nIt is now time to introduce the group of strong automorphisms.\n\n\fAutomorphism Groups of Saturated Structures\n\n29\n\nDefinition 4 [14] The group of strong automorphisms of M is the group generated\nby the set\n[\n{AutN (M ) ; N \u227a M }\nand is denoted Autf (M ).\nIt is easy to see that Autf (M ) is a normal subgroup of Aut(M ). Its index\nis at most 2\u05d00 . Moreover, the quotient group Aut(M )/Autf (M ) depend only on\nT : if M and M \u2032 are two saturated models, M \u227a M \u2032 , then there is a natural\nisomorphism from Aut(M )/Autf (M ) onto Aut(M \u2032 )/Autf (M \u2032 ). Aut(M )/Autf (M )\nwill be denoted Gal(T ) (of course, Gal stands for Galois). For example, if T is the\ntheory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0, Autf (M ) = AutQ\u0304 (M ) and\nGal(T ) is (isomorphic to) the group of automorphisms of Q\u0304.\nIn fact this interpretation is general. Assume first that M is of cardinality\nbigger than 2\u05d00 . Let \u03b1 be an ultra-imaginary element of M . It can be shown that\nthe following conditions are equivalent:\n1. card{f (\u03b1) ; f \u2208 Aut(M )} < card(M );\n2. card{f (\u03b1) ; f \u2208 Aut(M )} \u2264 2\u05d00 ;\nAn equivalence relation is bounded if it has at most 2\u05d00 classes (equivalently\nless than card(M ) classes). The above conditions are also equivalent to:\n3. \u03b1 (as a set) is the class modulo an invariant bounded equivalence relation.\nIf these conditions are satisfied, we say that \u03b1 is bounded. It should be remarked that an imaginary element is bounded if and only if it is algebraic, if and\nonly if its orbit is finite.\nWe will denote by Bdd(M ) the set of bounded ultra-imaginary elements of M .\nThis set does not really depend on M (as soon as its cardinality is big enough) but\nonly on its theory: any invariant bounded equivalence relation has a representative\nin any uncountable saturated model. We will allow ourself to write Bdd(T ) when\nconvenient. Moreover Autf (M ) is exactly the pointwise stabilizer of Bdd(M ) so\nthat Gal(T ) can be identified with the group of elementary permutations of Bdd(T ).\nWith some care, we can generalize this interpretation to models of small cardinality: for example, assume M countable, and let M \u2032 be a large saturated extension\nof M . Then any automorphism f of M extends to an automorphism of M \u2032 , and if f1\nand f2 are two such extensions, then their action on Bdd(M \u2032 ) are equal; Autf (M ) is\nexactly the set of automorphisms whose extensions to M \u2032 act trivially on Bdd(M \u2032 ).\nIn any case, Aut(M ) leaves fixed the set of bounded imaginary elements and\nthe set of bounded hyperimaginary elements. In some cases (for example for algebraically closed fields), Gal(T ) acts faithfully on the set of bounded imaginary\nelements. It is the case if T is stable ([14]). It is not known if it is always true\nfor simple theories, but it is true for the so-called low simple theories ([3]) and in\nparticular for supersimple theories. For simple theories, Gal(T ) acts faithfully on\nthe set of bounded hyperimaginary elements ([12]). In [4] there is an example of\na theory where the action of Gal(T ) on the set of hyperimaginary elements is not\nfaithful.\n\n\f30\n\nD. Lascar\n\nThere is a natural topology on Gal(T ) (see [19] for details). It can be defined\nin two different ways.\nMy favorite one is via the ultraproduct construction. Let (\u03b3i ; i \u2208 I) be a\nfamily of elements of Gal(T ) and U an ultrafilter on I. Choose a saturated model\nM and, for each Q\ni \u2208 I an automorphism fi \u2208 Aut(M ) lifting\nQ \u03b3i . Consider the\nultrapower M \u2032 = i\u2208U M . We can define the automorphism i\u2208U fi on M \u2032 . This\nautomorphism acts on Bdd(M \u2032 ) = Bdd(T ), so defines an element of Gal(T ), say \u03b2.\nThis element \u03b2 should be considered as a limit of the family (\u03b3i ; i \u2208 I) along U.\nA subset X of Gal(T ) is closed for the topology we are defining if it is closed for\nthis limit operation. You should be aware that the element \u03b2 may depend on the\nchoices of the fi 's, because the topology we are defining is not Hausdorff in general.\nThe other way to define a topological structure on Gal(T ) is to define a topology on Bdd(T ). If, as it is the case when T is stable, Gal(T ) can be identified with a\ngroup of permutation on the set of imaginary elements, then we just endow Gal(T )\nwith the pointwise convergence topology (that is we consider the set of imaginary\nelements with the discrete topology). Otherwise, it is more complicated, and here\nis what should be done in general:\nFor each n \u2264 \u03c9 and E invariant bounded equivalence relation on M n , consider\nthe canonical mapping \u03c6E from M n onto M n /E. By definition, a subset X of\n\u22121\n(X) is the intersection of a family of subsets\nM n /E is closed if and only if \u03c6E\ndefinable with parameters. Gal(T ) acts on M n /E and the topology on Gal(T ) is\ndefined as the coarsest topology which makes all these actions (with various n and\nE) continuous.\nNow, we can prove:\nTheorem 5 1. Gal(T ) is a topological compact group.\n2. It is Hausdorff if and only if it acts faithfully on the set of bounded hyperimaginary elements, if and only if it acts faithfully on the set of finitary bounded\nhyperimaginary elements.\n3. It is profinite if and only if it acts faithfully on the set of bounded imaginary\nelements.\nThere is a Galois correspondence between the subgroups of Gal(T ) and the\nbounded ultra-imaginary elements: every subgroup of Gal(T ) is the stabilizer of\nan ultra-imaginary element. The hyperimaginary elements correspond to the closed\nsubgroups and the imaginary elements correspond to the clopen subgroups of Gal(T ).\nLet H0 be the topological closure of the identity. Then H0 is a normal subgroup of Gal(T ). If we consider Gal(T ) as a permutation group on Bdd(T ), H0\nis exactly the pointwise stabilizer of the set of bounded hyperimaginary elements.\nSo, if we set Gal0 (T ) = Gal(T )/H0, Gal0 (T ) acts faithfully on the set of bounded\nhyperimaginary elements. As a quotient group, Gal0 (T ) is canonically endowed\nwith a topology. This way, we get a compact Hausdorff group.\nRecently, L. Newelski ([22]) has proved that H0 is either trivial or of cardinality\n2\u05d00 .\nI would like to conclude this section by a conjecture. In all the known examples\nof countable saturated structures where the small index property is false, there is a\n\n\fAutomorphism Groups of Saturated Structures\n\n31\n\nnon open subgroup of Gal(T ) of countable index (and, its preimage by the canonical\nhomomorphism from Aut(M ) onto Gal(T ) is a non open subgroup of Aut(M ) of\ncountable index). If A has a cardinality strictly less than card(M ), define AutfA (M )\nas the subgroup of AutA (M ) generated by\n[\n\n{AutN (M ) ; A \u2286 N \u227a M } .\n\nThe following conjecture is open, even in the \u03c9-categorical case:\nConjecture 6 Assume that M is a countable saturated structure and let H be a\nsubgroup of Autf (M ) of index strictly less than 2\u05d00 . Then, there exists a finite\nsubset A \u2282 M such that AutfA (M ) \u2286 H.\nIn [16], this conjecture is proved for almost strongly minimal sets (so, in particular for algebraically closed fields).\n\n5.\n\nThe uncountable case\n\nWe are now given a saturated structure M of cardinality \u03bb > \u05d00 . The small\nindex property has a natural generalization. If we assume that \u03bb<\u03bb = \u03bb (i.e. there\nis exactly \u03bb subsets of M of cardinality less than \u03bb) then any subgroup of Aut(M )\ncontaining a subgroup of the form AutA (M ) with card(A) < \u03bb has index at most\n\u03bb. The converse is true:\nTheorem 7 [20] Assume that M is a saturated structure of uncountable cardinality\n\u03bb = \u03bb<\u03bb , and let H be a subgroup of Aut(M ) of cardinality at most \u03bb. Then, there\nexists a subset A of M of cardinality less than \u03bb such that AutA (M ) \u2286 H.\nHere again, we may introduce a topological structure on Aut(M ): if \u03bc is an\ninfinite cardinal, let T\u03bc be the group topology on Aut(M ) for which a basis of open\nneighborhoods of the identity is\n{AutA (M ) ; A \u2286 M and card(A) < \u03bc} .\nTo complete this definition, let Ta (M ) be the group topology on Aut(M ) for which\na basis of open neighborhoods of the unit is\n{AutfA (M ) ; A \u2286 M and A finite} .\nThe above theorem just says that the subgroups of Aut(M ) of index at most \u03bb\nare exactly the open subgroups for T\u03bb (M ), and consequently, the topology T\u03bb (M )\ncan be reconstructed from the pure group structure. It is also clear that the open\nsubsets for T\u03bb are just the intersections of less than \u03bb Ta -open subsets. So, if one\nknows Ta (M ), one knows T\u03bb (M ).\nWith a few cardinality hypotheses, we can reconstruct one topological group\nfrom another: (see [15] for details):\n\n\f32\n\nD. Lascar\n1. Let M and M \u2032 be two saturated models of the same theory. Then we can\nreconstruct (Aut(M \u2032 ), Ta ) from (Aut(M ), Ta ).\n2. Let M and M \u2032 be two models of the same theory, and assume card(M ) = \u03bb <\n\u03bc = card(M \u2032 ). Then we can reconstruct Aut(M \u2032 ) from (Aut(M ), T\u03bb ) (and\nfrom Aut(M ) alone if \u03bb = \u03bb<\u03bb ). In fact we can reconstruct (Aut(M \u2032 ), T\u03c5 (M \u2032 ))\nfor every cardinal \u03c5, \u03bb \u2264 \u03c5 \u2264 \u03bc.\n3. Let M be a saturated structure of uncountable cardinality \u03bb = \u03bc+ = 2\u03bc and\nassume that T has a saturated model of cardinality \u03bc. Then (Aut(M ), Ta )\ncan be reconstructed from Aut(M ).\n\nLet us give an example of a theorem which can be proved using the above\nfacts: Assume GCH and let T1 and T2 be two theories with saturated models M1\nand M2 of cardinality \u03bc++ . Assume that Aut(M1 ) and Aut(M2 ) are isomorphic.\nThen, for all cardinal \u03bb, if T1 has a saturated model of cardinality \u03bb, then T2 has\nalso a saturated model in cardinality \u03bb, and the automorphism groups of these two\nmodels are isomorphic.\n\nReferences\n[1] G.
