Introduction\nA software model is the most significant arrangement\nin software development arena. From a simple web\npage to a complex multi-tier corporate system, a\nsuitable process model is the essential requirement to\nensure the reliability and success of the product [1,2,3].\nSoftware industry is practicing various classic models\nas well as modern smart architectural solutions to meet\nthe current rapidly changing user and system\nrequirements [4,5,6]. A number of papers have been\nwritten about CBD model in the last few years [7,8,9].\nThe objective of this paper is to propose a process for\nCBD. The proposed process uses library at analysis\nphase instead of design phase to develop complex\nsystems [2,10]. It also evaluates effects of quality\nparameters on reusability by presenting an equation\nbased on the responses of the survey. Section 2\nproposes the new Process. Section 3 describes\nsignificant features of the proposed process. Section 4\ndescribes validation of the proposed process using a\ncase study and a survey from sixteen software\n\nAnalysis,\nComponent & Risk\nManagement\n\nImplement\nCustomer\nEvaluation\n\nCustomization,\nComposition &\nTesting\n\nFigure 1- Diagrammatic View of the Proposed\nProcess\nA customer is communicated at the start of the project\nto gather basic requirements. Initial use cases are\ndeveloped at this stage to prepare project specification\nor proposal document during the planning phase.\nProject specification or proposal document is\ncomposed of feasibility and risk assessments that are\nperformed to prepare a cost benefits analysis (CBA)\n\n\fSci.Int.(Lahore),21(2),131-135,2009\n\nISSN 1013-5316; CODEN: SINTE 8\n\nsheet. CBA sheet helps customers to decide whether\nthe SW project is feasible for their organization or not.\nAnalysis phase is initiated if the customer approves the\nproposal. After the approval of the proposal in the\nplanning phase, detailed requirements are gathered\nduring the 'Analysis, Component and Risk\nManagement' phase. Here software engineering team\nidentifies and selects reusable components from inhouse library of components. Risks about new and\nexisting components are also evaluated and managed.\nThe properties, behavior and relationships among\ncomponents are identified as well.\nThe reusable components are customized according to\nthe requirements of the new system and tested during\n'Customization, Composition & Testing' phase. The\nnew components are designed, developed and tested on\na unit basis. Integration and system tests of the new and\nreusable components are performed as well. The\ncustomer is asked to evaluate and verify SW before\nimplement.\n\n3. Significant Features\nProposed Process\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nComponent-based software engineering (CBSE) main\nactivities are component identification, qualification,\nadaptation and composition [2]. Component\nqualification activity makes sure that the selected\ncomponent implements the required functionality,\ncomposes seamlessly into the architecture of new\napplication, and possesses the quality attributes [11].\n'Analysis, Component and Risk Management' phase of\nthe proposed process helps to identify and select\nreusable components rather than reinventing the wheel.\nThis improves productivity and efficiency of software\nengineers [12,13]. Deployment of library at analysis\nphase is a promising feature of the proposed process\nthat helps to identify and qualify components. Risk\nmanagement handles the risks regarding components.\n'Customization, Composition & Testing' phase deals\nwith adaptation, integration and testing of reusable\ncomponents.\n\n4. Validation of the Proposed Process\nfor CBD\nInitial validation of the proposed CBD process model\nis conducted by two methods that are:\n\uf0b7 A case study in a software company;\n\uf0b7 A survey from sixteen software development\ncompanies using questionnaire.\n4.1 Validation Using Case Study\n\nA case study was conducted to evaluate the proposed\nprocess in a software organization. The successful\nimplementation of this case study presented a positive\nsign for the suitability of the proposed process. Case\nstudy was conducted for a software company which\nimplemented the proposed process to develop and\nimplement leasing software for leading company of the\nUK. The detail to implement the proposed process is as\nfollows.\n'Project Planning' Phase\nThe analysts met client to gather basic requirements. A\nfeasibility report was made and approved by the client.\nNine month's time was estimated to customize the\nleasing software for the client. According to the plan\ntwo and half months would have to be spent on\ncomplete analysis, one and half month on core\ndesigning and five months on coding, testing and\nmaintenance.\n'Analysis, Component & Risk Management' Phase\nTwo analysts and one quality assurance leader were\nresponsible to prepare functional specification after\ngathering complete requirements. The PM conducted\nan impact/gap analysis meeting with all team members.\nMain objectives of the impact analysis meeting were\nto:\n\uf0b7 identify the reusable components.\n\uf0b7 measure the impact of the changes to\ncustomize the reusable components for the\nclient.\nA library of previously developed components was\navailable at a software company where case study was\nconducted. The library contained complete information\nof all parts of the SW. It was used during the impact\nanalysis to search the components which were\nreusable.\n'Customization, Composition & Testing' Phase\nOne and half month were spent on design according to\nthe schedule prepared during the planning phase.\nDetailed use cases, ERD, normalization and main user\ninterfaces were developed for the user stories (that\nwere different from client 1) by database developers.\nThe Project Manager decided for two weeks deadline\nto complete a build after completion of three months of\ncore designing. Five months were planned to\ncustomize, compose and test the reusable components.\nThe programmers integrated their components into the\napplication after conduction of unit, integration and\nsystem tests within two weeks time. The quality\nassurance engineers again conducted unit, integration\n\n\fSci.Int.(Lahore),21(2),131-135,2009\n\nISSN 1013-5316; CODEN: SINTE 8\n\nand system tests for all the components. The\nprogrammers were requested to fix the bugs if code\ncrashed during testing. This process also continued for\nrest of the coding duration. Two workable demos were\nshown to the client during customization of three\nreleases of the leasing application.\n'Customer Evaluation' Phase\nThe SW was successfully coded, tested and deployed\nwithin the planned duration. A contract was made with\nthe client company to provide maintenance of the SW.\n\nManagement' phase is highly suitable for CBD with\nrespect to the parameter and one means not suitable.\nThe parameters mentioned in Table 2 are as follows.\nB- Suitability of 'Analysis, Component & Risk\nManagement' phase of CBD projects.\nC- Suitability of 'Customization, Composition &\nTesting' phase for CBD projects.\nD- Suitability of 'Customer Evaluation' phase\nfor CBD projects.\nWeight \u2192\n\nThe results of the case study show that the proposed\nprocess is implementable for CBD.\n4.2 Validation Using Survey\nA survey involving sixteen software development\norganizations was conducted to evaluate the proposed\nProcess. The people who filled the forms had more\nthan six years experience in software development.\nQuestionnaire technique was used to gather the data.\nTwenty eight professionals were selected to fill the\nquestionnaire forms. It was divided into three main\nsections. Each section consisted of different questions.\nThe sections were:\n\uf0b7\n\nSuitability of proposed system development\nlife cycle (SDLC) phases for CBD.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nSuitability of library of in-house components\non the proposed SDLC phases for CBD.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nEffect on reusability with respect to\ninteroperability,\ncomplexity,\nefficiency,\nreliability, upgradeability, time saving, cost\nand quality for proposed CBD Process.\n\n% of 1\n\nB\n\n46\n\n54\n\nC\n\n35\n\n65\n\nD\n\n35\n\n65\n\nTable 2- Suitability of Proposed SDLC Phases for\nCBD Projects\nThe weight values in the questionnaire are from 0 to 1.\nOne means the proposed SDLC phases are highly\nsuitable for CBD with respect to the parameters and\nzero means not suitable.\nResults of Tables 1 to 2\nIt can be concluded from Tables 1 to 2 that respondents\nhighly supported the suitability of proposed SDLC\nphases for CBD projects.\n30\n\nEffects of Proposed Process Phases for CBD\nProjects\nTables 1 to 2 are based on evaluations.

It shows that\nvariation in quality is 0.869 because of defined\nvariables. It is expected that variables have strong\ncontribution if value of R square > 0.7 and weak if\nvalue of R square < 0.3 [15]. The variables in this\nmodel have very significant contribution because value\nof R square is 0.869 for the defined model. Therefore it\ncan be concluded that the model is highly reliable.\nReusability = - 0.163 + 0.176 interoperability + 0.472\ncomplexity + 0.003354 efficiency - .00868 reliability +\n0.111 upgradeability + 0.359 time saving \u2013 0.190 cost\n+ 0.172 quality\nThe equation indicates effect of independent variables\n(Interoperability, complexity, efficiency, reliability,\nupgradeability, time saving, cost and quality) on the\ndependent variable (reusability). The adjustment factor\nin equation is \u2013 0.163 which calculates the effect of\nquality parameters on reusability by SPSS statistical\nsoftware package itself [15].\nThe defined model suggests that if a unit:\n\uf0b7 increases interoperability it increases 0.176\nunits in reusability;\n\uf0b7 increases complexity it increases 0.472 units\nin reusability;\n\uf0b7 increases efficiency it increases 0.003354\nunits in reusability;\n\n\fSci.Int.(Lahore),21(2),131-135,2009\n\nISSN 1013-5316; CODEN: SINTE 8\n\n\uf0b7\n\nincreases reliability it decreases 0.00868 units\nin reusability;\n\uf0b7 increases time saving it increases 0.359 units\nin reusability;\n\uf0b7 increases cost it decreases 0.190 units in\nreusability;\nThese results show quality metrics (interoperability,\ncomplexity, efficiency, reliability, upgradeability, time\nsaving, cost saving and quality) have very significant\neffect on reusability. This shows that the proposed\nprocess is reasonably useful for software companies\nusing CBD.\n\n5. Conclusion\nA new process has been presented for the componentbased development. A case study has been conducted\nfor a software organization to validate the proposed\nprocess. A survey involving sixteen software\ndevelopment organizations has also been carried out to\nevaluate the proposed process. An equation has been\ndeveloped from the data to estimate the effect of\nquality parameters on reusability. The results of the\nequation show that the proposed model is highly\nreliable and quality factors have significant effect on\nreusability. The proposed process provides strong\nsupport for\nreusability, interoperability,\nupgradeability, less complexity, time saving, cost\nsaving, reliability and also improved quality. The\nvalidation of the proposed process for CBD provides\nan indication for its usability for software industry.\n\n6.
