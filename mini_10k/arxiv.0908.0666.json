Low temperature experiments on diffusive metals coupled to superconductors have reported\nlarge interference effects analogous to coherent backscattering, weak-localization and Aharonov-Bohm oscillations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], one to two orders of magnitude above the universal amplitude O(e2 /h) they have in\npurely metallic mesoscopic conductors [8]. In some cases,\na weak localization-like behavior, in the form of positive\nmagnetoconductance near zero field is observed [2, 7], but\noften one sees negative magnetoconductance [3, 4, 5, 6].\nTheoretical works predict that Andreev reflection from\nthe superconductor induces this large quantum correction to transport [9, 10]. The general expectation is that\nthis correction is similar to a magnified weak-localization\ncorrection, in that its sign is determined by the presence\nor absence of spin-orbit interaction (SOI) [8, 11]. In this\npaper we revisit this issue, and find that this interference correction has very different properties from weaklocalization. In particular, we show that both the specific\nlead-geometry and an applied magnetic flux can reverse\nits sign, while SOI need not.\nAndreev reflection [12] is the dominant low energy process at the interface between a metal and a superconductor. It involves an electron (hole) being retroreflected\nas a hole (electron) and retracing the path previously\nfollowed by the electron (hole). In this article, we extend the trajectory-based semiclassical theory to include\nAndreev reflection, analyze the conductance of a twodimensional ballistic quantum dot coupled to one superconducting lead and two normal leads, as in Fig. 1. We\ndub this system an Andreev quantum dot. We arrive at\nthe surprising conclusion that the interference effects can\nbe reversed from localizing to antilocalizing by changing\nthe widths of the normal leads, or by threading a fraction of a magnetic flux quantum through the dot. In\ncontrast SOI need not cause such a reversal. This is\nvery different from weak-localization in purely metallic\nconductors, whose sign is solely determined by the presence or absence of SOI [8, 11, 13]. We predict two clear\n\n111111111\n000000000\n000000000\n111111111\nbulk superconductor (S)\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\nVS\n000000000\n111111111\nIS\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\n\n(a)\n\nVL\n\nVR\n\nL lead\nbulk\nnormal (N)\nmetal\n\nL\n\nIL\n\nIR\n\nR lead\nbulk N\n\nchaotic quantum dot\n(b)\n\n(c)\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n\nbulk S\nbulk N\n\nquantum dot\n\nbulk contact C\n\nbulk S island\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n\nquantum dot\n\nFigure 1: (a) A two-dimensional Andreev quantum dot in a\nthree-terminal geometry, with two normal (N) and one superconducting (S) lead.

Thick green (thin violet) paths\nindicate electrons (holes), dashed lines indicate complex-conjugated amplitudes. Normal leads are labelled i, j while the S lead\nis superconducting. The contributions are classified by the number of uncorrelated Andreev reflections (ee0 has none, ee2I and\nee2II both have two). The full (open) squares on the S lead indicate a factor of \u03b7 (\u03b7 \u2217 ) and the ellipses mark encounters.\n\nwhere \u03bcj is the chemical potential of normal (N) lead j\nand \u03bcS of all the superconducting (S) leads. The FermiDirac distribution, f (\u03b5), has \u03b5 measured from \u03bcS . Here\nwe use trajectory-based semiclassics to find the scattering probability Tij\u03b1\u03b2 to go from quasiparticle \u03b2 = e, h\n(electron, hole) in lead j to quasiparticle \u03b1 in lead i. Extending trajectory-based semiclassics [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]\nto include Andreev reflection, one has [20]\nZ\nZ\nX\n1\nTij\u03b1\u03b2 =\ndy0 dy\nA\u03b31 A\u2217\u03b32 exp[i\u03b4S/~] .

The phase\n\u03b4S = S\u03b31 \u2212 S\u03b32 gives the difference in action phase accumulated along \u03b31 and \u03b32, and A\u03b3 gives the stability of\nthe trajectory \u03b3. In contrast to Ref. [20], we consider the\nphysically more prevalent situation of an Ehrenfest time\nnegligible against the dwell time \u03c4D inside the dot. In\nthat case, even with perfect Andreev reflection, quantum\nuncertainties combined with the chaotic dynamics make\nthe retroreflected quasiparticle diverge from the incoming quasiparticle path well before it leaves the dot [21].\nTherefore classical paths undergoing Andreev reflections\nconsist of electron and hole segments that do not necessarily retrace each other all the way. For transmission\nprobabilities hTij\u03b1\u03b2 i averaged over energy or dot shape,\nwe must pair the paths \u03b31 and \u03b32 in Eq. (2) in ways\nthat render their action phase difference stationary. To\ndo this we either pair a path with a complex conjugate\npath, e-e\u2217 or h-h\u2217 , or we pair an electron path with a hole\npath, e-h or e\u2217 -h\u2217 . Path-pairs can meet and swap pairings at encounters, as shown in Fig. 2. Following Ref. [16]\nwe distinguish between encounters that lie entirely inside\nthe dot and those that touch a lead.\nFeynman rules. Contributions relevant to current\nnoise in purely metallic samples [16, 17, 18, 19], become\nrelevant for the calculation of the current itself in the\npresence of S leads when they can be made from only\ntwo classical trajectories with some segments as electron\nand others as holes. From Refs. [16, 18, 19] and the above\nconsiderations, we derive the following Feynman rules for\n\ncalculating transmission through an Andreev quantum\ndot. The dot is connected to normal and superconducting\nleads, each carrying Ni \u226b 1 and NSj \u226b 1Ptransport\nPchannels respectively, and we write NT = i Ni + j NSj\nFor a perpendicular magnetic field, b = B/Bc , measured\nin units of the field Bc \u2243 (h/eA)(\u03c40 /\u03c4D )1/2 that breaks\ntime-reversal (TR) symmetry in a quantum dot of area\nA with time of flight \u03c40 , the Feynman rules read:\n(i) An e-e\u2217 or h-h\u2217 path-pair gives a factor of [NT (1 +\n\u03c7b2 )]\u22121 , with \u03c7 = 1 for time-reversed paths and \u03c7 = 0\notherwise.\n(ii) An e-h or e\u2217 -h\u2217 path-pair gives NT\u22121 \u00d7 (1 \u00b1 i2\u03b5\u03c4D +\n\u03c7b2 )\u22121 , with upper (lower) sign for e-h (e\u2217 -h\u2217 ).\n(iii) An encounter inside the dot and connecting e,e\u2217 , h\nand h\u2217 paths (as in he2II) gives a factor \u2212NT .\n(iv) An encounter inside the dot and connecting e, e,\ne\u2217 and h paths (as in ee2II) gives a factor of \u2212NT (1 +\ni2\u03b5\u03c4D + b2 ); this factor is complex conjugated (c.c.) for\nan encounter connecting e, e\u2217 , e\u2217 and h\u2217 paths.\n(v) An encounter touching a N lead i (S lead j) gives a\nfactor of Ni (NSj ).\n(vi) A path-pair that ends at a N lead i (S lead j), while\nnot in an encounter, gives a factor of Ni (NSj ).\n(vii) Andreev reflections at S leads involving e\u2192h give\na factor of \u03b7 e\u2212i\u03a6Sj while those involving h\u2192e give a\nfactor of \u03b7 ei\u03a6Sj (e\u2217 \u2192h\u2217 and h\u2217 \u2192e\u2217 give the c.c. of\nthese factors), where \u03a6Sj is the S phase on lead j, and\n\u03b7 = exp[\u2212iarcos (\u03b5/\u2206)] is the Andreev reflection phase.\nWe note that these rules equally follow from randommatrix theory [17].\nIn our analysis of the consequences of these rules, we\nconsider temperatures well below the superconducting\ngap \u2206 where \u03b7 = \u2212i, and consider a single S lead (setting \u03a6S = 0 without loss of generality). The rules indicate that a path-pair going from encounter to encounter\nreduces the contribution by a factor of O[NT ]. Thus to\nleading order in NT , we can neglect such (weak localization) contributions. This does not restrict the number of\nencounters, because the price to add an encounter whose\nadditional legs go to S leads is O[(NS /NT )2 ]. We therefore take NS /NT \u226a 1, and expand in the number of\nuncorrelated Andreev reflections.\nRestricting ourselves to O[(NS /NT )2 ], we need to consider the contributions shown in Fig. 2 involving no more\n\n\f3\n\n(3a)\n\nhTijee2I i = Ni Nj NS2 /NT3 ,\n\n(3b)\n\nhTijee2II i =\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\n2Ni Nj NS2\nRe (1 + b2 + i2\u03b5\u03c4D2 )\u22121 .

We first consider the situation where the S lead's potential is fixed externally.\nThis may be the three-terminal device of Fig. 1a with\nboth the R and S leads grounded, while the L lead is\nbiased at electrochemical potential \u03bcL = eV . Alternatively this may be the two-terminal device in Fig. 1b\nwith the S and R leads join at a bulk contact (with contact conductance vastly greater than the dot), a macroscopic distance away from the dot. In either case, the L\nlead current is IL = (2e2 /h) [gcl + \u03b4gqm (T, b)] V , where\nwe define a dimensionless classical conductance gcl =\nNL (NR + 2NS )/(NL + NR + 2NS ) [22]. For NS \u226a N\nthe quantum interference correction is\n\u03b4gqm =\n\nNL [NR \u2212 4NL (1 + b2 )]NS2\nf (T, b) + \u03b4gwl .\n(NL + NR )3\n\n10\n5\n\n(5)\n\nIn the regime of experimental interest the weaklocalization correction in the absence of the S lead\n\u03b4gwl \u2243 \u2212NL NR /[(NL + NR )2 (1 + b2 )] is small enough\nto neglect (as in Fig. 3). The \u03b5-integral in Eq. (1)\nwith hTij\u03b1\u03b2 i in Eqs. (3,4) leads to f (T, b) = \u03b1 \u03b6(2, 1/2 +\n(1 + b2 )\u03b1), with \u03b1 = ET /4\u03c0kB T for a Thouless energy\nTh = ~/\u03c4D , and the generalized \u03b6-function \u03b6(2, x) =\nRE\u221e\n0 t exp[\u2212xt]/(1\u2212exp[\u2212t])dt. This gives the two asymptotics f (T \u2192 \u221e, b) \u2192 \u03c0ET /[8kB T (1 + b2 )] and f (T \u2192\n0, b) \u2192 1/(1 + b2 )2 .\nAt zero temperature, we find three regimes for \u03b4gqm :\n(a) For NR < 2NL , \u03b4gqm < 0 for all values of b, and gives\na monotonic magnetoconductance curve.\n(b) For 2NL < NR < 4NL , \u03b4gqm < 0 for all b, but gives\na non-monotonic magnetoconductance, with a minimum\nat b2 = (NR \u2212 2NL )/(2NL ).\n(c) For NR > 4NL , \u03b4gqm > 0 at small b, but becomes\nnegative for b2 > (NR \u2212 4NL )/(4NL ), and then goes to\nzero for large b. As in (b), the curve is non-monotonic\nwith minima at b2 = (NR \u2212 2NL )/(2NL ).\n\n15\n\nNR/NL=7.2\n\nkBT=0.1 ET\n\n10\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-5\n\nNR/NL=0.2\n\n-10\n-15\n-4\n\nhTijhe1 i = Ni Nj NS /NT2 ,\n(4a)\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0002 2\n2 2\n2 2\nhe2I\n2\nhTij i = \u03b4ij Ni NS / NT (1 + b ) + 4\u03b5 \u03c4D , (4b)\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\nhTijhe2II i = \u2212Ni Nj NS2 / NT3 (1 + b2 )2 + 4\u03b52 \u03c4D2 , (4c)\n\nhTijhe2III i = \u2212hTijee2IIi.\n\n2\n\nhTijee0 i = Ni Nj /NT ,\n\n15\n\n\u03b4gqm [2e /h]\n\nthan two uncorrelated Andreev reflections.

Left panel: kB T = 0.1ET , and NR /NL = n+0.2, n =\n0, 1, 2, ...7 (from bottom to top). Right panel: NR /NL = 0.2\n(dashed red) and 7.2 (dot-dashed blue), for kB T /ET = 0.1, 1,\n2, 4 and 8 (dashed: from bottom to top; dot-dashed: from top\nto bottom). For both panels, the vertical axis gives \u03b4gqm in\nunits of the conductance quantum 2e2 /h with channel numbers chosen such that NS2 NL2 /(NL + NR )3 = 5 in all instances.\nNote the crossover from monotonic to non-monotonic behavior of the magnetoconductance as T increases, for NR /NL =\n0.2 (dashed red curves).\n\nThese different regimes persist at finite temperature as is\nillustrated in Fig. 3, however, the boundary between (a)\nand (b), as well as the positions of the minima of the magnetoconductance curves are T -dependent. The conductance exhibits a metal-like (insulating-like) behavior in\nthe form of a decrease (increase) of the conductance with\nT , depending on the sign of (NR \u22124(1+b)2NL ). This sign\ncan easily be changed, whenever one has control over the\nlead widths or the magnetic flux. Remarkably, a monotonic magnetoconductance may become non-monotonic\nupon increase of the temperature (dashed red curves in\nFig. 3).\nSet-up with an S island. In the second of the two\npossible two-terminal set-ups, Fig. 1c), the quantum dot\nis connected to a superconducting island, whose chemical\npotential is floating, and adapts itself to a value guaranteeing current conservation, IL = \u2212IR . Using the expression in Ref. [14] for the two-terminal conductance in\nterms of the transmission probabilities, Tij\u03b1\u03b2 , we obtain\nisl\nisl\nisl\ng = gcl\n+ \u03b4gqm\n(T, b) where gcl\n= NL NR /(NL + NR ) and\nisl\n= NL NR NS2 (NL + NR )\u22123 f (T, b). This reproduces\n\u03b4gqm\nthe random matrix theory result [10] to leading order in\n[NS /(NL + NR )]2 . This quantum correction always increase the conductance (antilocalization) by a parametrically large amount (many e2 /h), with a monotonic magnetoconductance curve.\nMesoscopic conductance fluctuations and current noise. Ref. [23] used random matrix theory to\nshow that conductance fluctuations remain O(e2 /h) in\nthe presence of superconductivity. Our Feynman rules\nreproduce this result. Contributions to var[g] are the\nproduct of any two contributions in Fig. 2 connected by\n\n\f4\nencounters. Since path-pairs are not swapped at entrance\nand exit, the connection must involve at least two additional encounters with four additional path-pairs, and\nthe resulting contribution behaves as NT\u22122 times the average conductance squared. This is at most O[NT0 ], thus\nthe quantum corrections to the average conductance are\nparametrically larger than the conductance fluctuations,\nand are therefore easily observable.\nThe S contact also leads to e-h contributions to the\ncurrent-noise [24]. The Feynman rules show that they are\nO[NT (NS /NT )n ] for n \u2265 1 and are thus smaller than the\nO[NT ] e-e contributions which give the noise in the absence of an S lead. Therefore, to leading order in NS /NT ,\nthe parametric magnitude of the zero-frequency currentnoise is unaltered by the presence of the S lead.\nEffect of SOI. Spin-orbit interaction (SOI) can be\ntreated as rotating the spin along otherwise unchanged\nclassical trajectories, multiplying Eq. (2) by Tr[d\u03b31 d\u2020\u03b32 ],\nwhere d\u03b3i is the SU(2)-phase of path \u03b3i [25]. For ee0, ee2I\nand he1, this gives a factor of two for spin-degeneracy,\nbecause d\u03b31 = d\u03b32 . However for ee2II and he2III it gives\nTr[d21 ], and for he2I and he2II it gives Tr[d21 d22 ], where\nd1 , d2 are statistically independent random SU(2) phases.\nWhen the SOI time is shorter than \u03c4D , one averages uniformly over the SU(2) phases [26], which multiplies ee2II\nand he2III by \u22121/2, and he2I and he2II by 1/4. Taking\nT = 0 and neglecting \u03b4gwl for simplicity, we find that\n\u03b4gqm =\n\nNL [(1 \u2212 2/\u03b2)2 NR + 4(1 \u2212 2/\u03b2)NL ] NS2\n, (6a)\n(NL + NR )3\n\nisl\n\u03b4gqm\n= (1 \u2212 2/\u03b2)2 NL NR NS2 /(NL + NR )3 ,\n\n(6b)\n\nfor the three standard symmetry classes, \u03b2 = 1 (TR symmetry without SOI), 2 (no TR symmetry) and 4 (TR\nsymmetry with SOI). Note the presence of the same symmetry prefactor (1 \u2212 2/\u03b2) as for weak localization without superconductivity. Thus with SOI (\u03b2 = 4), both\nisl\n\u03b4gqm and \u03b4gqm\nalways enhance conductance. Therefore,\nSOI must be absent for a sign change of \u03b4gqm with lead\nwidth. Turning on SOI (going from \u03b2 = 1 to \u03b2 = 4)\nisl\nnever changes the sign of \u03b4gqm\nbut changes the sign of\n\u03b4gqm for NR < 4NL .\nConcluding remarks. The derivation outlined here\nis for ballistic quantum dots, however the Feynman rules\nthat we analyze apply to any system well-modelled by\nrandom matrix theory. Thus our results are equally applicable to disordered dots. We also expect qualitatively\nsimilar behaviors in diffusive metals coupled to superconductors at intermediate temperatures, kB T \u223c ET . Work\nin this regime is in progress.\nUpon completion of this work, we noted Ref. [27]\nwhich uses a somewhat similar methodology as ours in\nclosed Andreev billiards. RW thanks L.
