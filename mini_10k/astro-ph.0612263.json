Though the \u039bCDM model\ngives currently the best means to explain the formation of\nthese galaxies, this scenario has the well-known problem\nof a discrepancy of 1\u20132 orders of magnitude between the\nnumber of low mass structures predicted by this theory and\nthe observed number of satellite galaxies (Moore et al. 1999;\n\n\u22c6\n\nBased on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam,\na joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the CanadaFrance-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institute National\ndes Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche\nScientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.\nBased on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space\nTelescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope\nInstitute. STScI is operated by the association of Universities for\nResearch in Astronomy, Inc. under the NASA contract NAS 526555.\n\nKlypin et al. 1999). Their apparent alignments in great circles (Lynden-Bell 1976) have led some authors to propose\na tidal (non-cosmological) origin (Kroupa 1997), possibly\nby the early interaction between Andromeda and the Milky\nWay (Sawa & Fujimoto 2004).\nThus the study of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is of importance in our attempt to understand the formation of galaxies in general and also the distribution of the dark matter.\nThese small galaxies are most easily examined in the Local\nGroup due to their proximity, and of the dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies in this region Draco is arguably the most interesting in terms of its importance in placing constraints on the\ndistribution of dark matter on small scales.\nThe Draco dSph is a small, faint, and metal-poor Galactic satellite situated about 71 kpc from the Sun (see Table 1). The stellar population is very old (> 8-10 Gyr) and\nvery metal poor ([Fe/H] = \u22121.8 \u00b1 0.2 dex) (Apparicio et al.\n2001). Its total i-band luminosity is (L/L\u2299 ) = 2.4\u00b10.5\u00d7105\n(Odenkirchen et al. 2001), and King model (King 1962) fits\nto the stellar profile, show that it has a core radius of 7.7\u2032 ,\nand a tidal radius of 40.1\u2032 . Under the assumption of Virial\nequilibrium, the high stellar velocity dispersion implies an\nextremely high mass to light ratio of about 146 \u00b1 42 in Solar units, according to Odenkirchen et al. (2001) (hereafter\nO01) or 330 \u00b1 125 according to Kleyna et al. (2002) (here-\n\n\f2\n\nMathieu S\u00e9gall, Rodrigo Ibata, Michael Irwin, N., F. Martin & Scott Chapman\n\nTable 1.

Several other studies (e.g., Klessen et al. 2003;\nLokas 2002), also conclude that it is probably a very strongly\ndark-matter dominated galaxy.\nIn many of its properties Draco is very similar to the\nUrsa Minor dSph, another low-mass Milky Way satellite.\nSurveys of the latter galaxy, however, have shown the presence of tidally-induced features which attest to the nonequilibrium state of that galaxy (Olszewski & Aaronson\n1985; Bellazzini et al. 2002; Palma et al. 2003), and imply\nthat the dark matter fraction may well be much lower in\nUrsa Minor than might be naively expected. In contrast,\nprevious studies of Draco have shown it to have a smooth\nsymmetrical shape (O01; Piatek et al. 2001; Bellazzini et al.\n2002). Indeed, no study has yet found evidence for a distorted distribution of stars in the halo of the Draco dSph,\nwhich would be expected if it did not possess a massive\ndark matter mini-halo to protect the stellar component from\nthe strong tidal field of the Milky Way. Recently however,\nWilkinson et al. (2004) (hereafter W04) discovered a break\nin the light profile of Draco at \u2248 25\u2032 and a sharp decline\nin the velocity dispersion at \u2248 30\u2032 . They concluded that the\nouter part of Draco is filled with a dynamically colder stellar\npopulation, which could be caused by an external tidal field.\nOur aim in this work is therefore to search more thoroughly for tidal perturbations in the halo of the Draco dSph,\nusing the new generation of wide-field cameras. The outline\nof the paper is as follows: \u00a72 describes the observations and\nthe data reduction processes, \u00a73 details the selection criteria for Draco stars, while \u00a74 discusses the analysis of the\nphotometric survey, the different star populations that are\npresent, and the search for substructures in the outskirts of\nthis small galaxy. Finally, \u00a75 and \u00a76 are dedicated to the\ndiscussion of our results and the conclusions of the study.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\nMegaCam and INT surveys\n\nThe Draco dSph galaxy was observed with the wide-field\nMegaCam camera at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope\n(CFHT) in service mode during the 2004A and 2005A observing seasons. Megacam is a mosaic of 36 4612 \u00d7 2048\nEEV chips, offering a field of \u223c 0.96 \u00d7 0.94 square degrees.\nWe chose to observe seven fields, six around the galaxy and a\n\ncomparison field four degrees in declination below the centre\nof the galaxy. Taken in photometric conditions, the images\ntotalled 950 s, 1090 s and 1700 s per field in, respectively, the\nMegaCam g, r and i bands. The seeing ranged from 0\u2032\u2032.46 to\n1\u2032\u2032.12, with the majority of the images being taken in seeing\nbetter than 0\u2032\u2032.8.\nThe images were pre-processed by the CFHT \"Elixir\"\npipeline yielding debiassed, flat-fielded images, with i-band\nfringing artefacts removed. Photometric standards observed\nover the season are used by \"Elixir\" to measure the zeropoint in each passband for every pointing. The resulting\nimages were subsequently passed through the photometry\npipeline developed for the Wide Field Camera (WFC) of\nthe Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) (Irwin & Lewis 2001),\nsuitably altered to deal with MegaCam data.\nCatalogue generation follows the precepts outlined by\nIrwin (1985, 1996) and includes the facility to: automatically track any background variations on scales of typically\n20-30 arcsec; detect and deblend images or groups of images; and parameterise the detected images to give various\n(soft-edged) aperture fluxes, position and shape measures.\nThe generated catalogues start with an approximate World\nCoordinate System (WCS) defined by the known telescope\nand camera properties (the WCS distortion model) and are\nthen progressively refined using the 2MASS (2 Micron All\nSky Survey) astrometric catalogues to give an internal precision generally better than 0.1 arcsec and a global external\nprecision of 0.25 arcsec. These latter numbers are solely dependent on the accuracy of the astrometric catalogues used\nin the refinement.\nAll catalogues for all CCDs for each pointing are then\nprocessed using the image shape parameters for morphological classification in the main categories: stellar, non-stellar,\nand noise-like. A sampled curve-of-growth for each detected\nobject is derived from a series of aperture flux measures\nas a function of radius. The classification is then based on\ncomparing the curve-of-growth of the flux for each detected\nobject with the well-defined curve-of-growth for the general\nstellar locus. This latter is a direct measure of the integral\nof the point spread function (PSF) out to various radii and\nis independent of magnitude, if the data are properly linearised, and if saturated images are excluded. The average\nstellar locus on each detector is clearly defined and is used\nas the basis for a null hypothesis stellar test for use in classification. The curve-of-growth for stellar images is also used\nto automatically estimate frame-based aperture corrections\nfor conversion to total flux.\nVarious quality control plots are generated by the\npipeline and these were used to monitor characteristics such\nas the seeing, the average stellar image ellipticity (to measure trailing), the sky brightness and sky noise, the size of\naperture correction for use with the \"optimal\" aperture flux\nestimates (here \"optimal\" refers to the well-known property\nthat soft-edged apertures of roughly the average seeing radius provide close to profile fit accuracy, e.g., Naylor 1998).\nThe \"optimal\" catalogue fluxes for the g, r, i filters for each\nfield were then combined to produce a single matched catalogue for each pointing and the overlaps between pointings\nwere used to cross-calibrate all the catalogues to a common\nsystem to within an accuracy \u223c 1% across the survey region.\nFor completeness we also present here an earlier\npanoramic dataset obtained with the INT WFC on the\n\n\fDraco, a flawless dwarf galaxy\n\n3\n\nnights of the 11th, and the 13th to 15th of October 2002.\nThe WFC is a mosaic of four 4k \u00d7 2k EEV chips, offering\na field of \u223c 0.29 square degrees. A total of 11 pointings\nwere observed in photometric conditions, with exposures of\n1800 sec in the equivalent of the Johnson V passband and\n1800 sec in the equivalent of the Gunn i band at each pointing. The seeing ranged from 0\u2032\u2032.7 to 1\u2032\u2032.1. The INT WFC images were reduced in an identical manner to the MegaCam\nobservations, with the exception that the pre-processing was\nperformed with the INT pipeline. A small offset of 0.106\nmagnitudes was applied to the i-band INT magnitudes to\nbring them into agreement with the MegaCam values.\nTables 2 and 3 list the photometry resulting from the\nMegaCam and INT surveys, showing g, r, i-band MegaCam\nmagnitudes (in the AB system), V and i-band INT magnitudes (converted into the MegaCam AB system), with their\nuncertainties, a classification parameter in each passband\n(cg , cr , ci and cV ), and the equatorial coordinates for each\nobject. This classification index is a flag that indicates the\nlikely nature of the objects. A classification index of 1 corresponds to a likely galaxy, \u22121, . . . , \u22129 to a point-sources (in\norder of decreasing confidence of stellarity), and 0 to an artefact or noise. The INT photometry is only used to calibrate\nthe HST V-band photometry.\n\n2.2\n\nHST survey\n\nWe also analysed a series of HST images of a field in the\ncentre of the Draco dSph. The data were taken in 1995 and\n1999 with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WFPC2),\nin two spectral bands, V (F606W) and i (F814W). The total\nexposure time amounts to 4000 sec in F606W and 4500 sec\nin F814W. The wide-field (WF) chips of the mosaic were\nreduced with the DAOPHOT/ALLSTAR package (Stetson\n1987; Stetson et al. 1990). A point spread function (PSF)\npreviously constructed for a study of the globular cluster\nM4 (Ibata et al. 1999) in each of the WF chips was used to\nfit the profiles of all detected sources in the WF mosaic. This\nyielded, for each detected object, the coordinates, the magnitude, a parameter describing the profile shape (sharpness)\nand the \u03c7 value of the PSF fit. The equatorial coordinates\nof the sources were determined by comparison to the MegaCam survey. The instrumental WFPC2 F606W and F814W\nmagnitudes were calibrated onto the INT V-band and MegaCam i-band systems, respectively, by assuming a simple offset with no colour terms. The correspondence between the\nbands is reasonably acceptable, as we show in Fig. 1.\nThe images listed in Table 5 do not cover exactly the\nsame area of sky, and have offsets of up to \u223c 80 pixels. Since\nwe were primarily interested in measuring the stellar density\nprofile in the inner regions of the Draco dSph, we retained\nonly the overlapping region in common to all 14 exposures,\nthereby ensuring that the region was surveyed to a uniform\ndepth.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nSAMPLE SELECTION\nCompleteness\n\nThe deep HST photometry in the centre of the galaxy is\nuseful to help define the stellarity criteria and also to de-\n\nFigure 1. HST F606W photometry was calibrated as a simple\noffset from the INT V band (upper panel). Likewise, HST F814W\nphotometry was calibrated with MegaCam i (lower panel). (The\nincreased scatter at i=20 is due to photometric variability of horizontal branch stars).\n\ntermine the completeness of the MegaCam survey. We find\nthat adopting MegaCam sources with classification indices\nof either -1 or -2 in all three passbands results in zero false\nobjects (i.e. zero sources not present in the HST survey). The\ncompletness for this selection is represented with a dashed\nline in Fig. 2. We also show, with a solid line, the completness when we select all the MegaCam objects (classification\nindex from 1 to -9). To i = 24 both selections have completeness > 50%. Down to this limit, the adopted selection\non classification indices does not make us lose a substantial\nfraction of stars. It should be noted that the incompleteness\nis affected to a significant extent by the crowding, which is\nmaximal in the central region probed by the HST field, but\nwill be much less problematic in the outskirts of the galaxy.\nFig. 2 therefore represents the worst completeness over the\nsurvey.\n3.2\n\nStar selection\n\nFig. 3 shows the colour magnitude diagram (CMD) of the\nMegaCam stars in the central region of Draco within a radius\nof 6\u2032 . To reduce the contamination by foreground stars and\nbackground galaxies, we construct a selection region covering the red giant branch (RGB) to sub-giant branch (SGB)\non the central CMD. As the red giant branch has very low\ncontrast compared to the \"background\" in some fields (or\n\n\f4\n\nMathieu S\u00e9gall, Rodrigo Ibata, Michael Irwin, N., F. Martin & Scott Chapman\n\nTable 2.

A fairly broad\nselection is chosen here to ensure that we do not reject a\nsignificant fraction of members of the dwarf galaxy.\nClearly a simple CMD filter is not an optimal way to\nselect Draco-like stars, particularly towards fainter magnitudes, where the discrimination between stars of the dwarf\ngalaxy and background galaxies is difficult.

Assuming Poisson noise, this simplifies\nfurther to\nnR \u2212 f nB\n.\nS/N = p\nnR + f 2 nB\n\nFigure 3. The colour-magnitude diagram of the central 6\u2032 of the\nDraco dSph, showing g magnitude as a function of g \u2212 i (left) and\ng \u2212 r (right). The initial CMD selection is indicated.\n\nLet us consider first the region inside 6\u2032 (displayed in Fig. 3),\ntaking the stars within the selection polygon. We bin the\nCMD in intervals of 0.05 mag in g-i colour and 0.25 mag in\ng-band magnitude. For each bin, we calculate the signal-tonoise ratio, and we sort the resulting array. Starting with the\nCMD bin of highest signal to noise, we examine each new\nbin in decreasing order of S/N testing whether the additional\nbin adds to the total S/N, in which case the bin is accepted.\nIt transpires that upon applying this process we accept the\nwhole region within the polygon of Fig. 3, i.e. in the region\nwithin 6\u2032 of the galaxy centre, all of the CMD bins contribute\nusefully to the total S/N.\nHowever, this will not the case on the outskirts of the\ngalaxy, where nR \u2212 f nB \u2248 0. In the outer regions the signal\nfrom the dwarf galaxy is of course extremely weak, so one\ncannot apply the same procedure as above. We use instead\nthe CMD within 6\u2032 as a model. Now the signal to noise ratio\nbecomes:\ngnD\nS/N = p\nnR + g 2 nD\n\nFigure 4. As Fig. 3, but for the comparison field.\n\nwhere nD is the number of Draco stars in the central (6\u2032 )\nregion and g is an unknown normalisation factor combining the ratio of geometrical areas between the area of interest and the central region and the relative frequency of\nstars from the dwarf galaxy in the outer region compared to\nthe central region. Since nR >> g 2 nD in this backgrounddominated case, we find that S/N \u2248 CnD (nR )\u22121/2 , with\nC a constant of proportionality whose value we need not\nknow. We proceed as above, binning the CMD, calculating\nthe signal-to-noise ratio in each bin (to within the multiplicative constant), and sorting the resulting array. We find\nthat in the outskirts of the galaxy at radii beyond 45\u2032 an optimal CMD selection includes the main-sequence turnoff and\nparts of the horizontal branch and blue-straggler regions.\nThe left and middle panels of Fig 5 show the result\nof these two selection methods, where we present the full\n\n\f6\n\nMathieu S\u00e9gall, Rodrigo Ibata, Michael Irwin, N., F. Martin & Scott Chapman\n\nFigure 5. The left and middle panels show, respectively, the\nresult of the CMD filters constructed to optimise signal to noise\nin the central regions (S1) and in the outer regions of the galaxy\n(S2). The right hand panel shows the weight array of the matched\nfilter analysis.\n\ndataset of point-sources, filtered by the two CMD filters.\nThese two CMD filters allow us to construct a star selection\nappropriate for the centre of the dwarf galaxy (S1, on the\nleft-hand panel), and the other (S2, in the middle panel)\nthat enhances the signal to noise in the external parts of the\ngalaxy, where the background is high. We retain 25670 stars\nfor the S1 selection and 5385 stars for S2. Fig. 6 shows the\nspatial distribution of the two selections.\nThe matched-filter technique (see e.g., Rockosi et al.\n2002) provides an alternative means to enhance the signal\nof an expected CMD structure in the presence of contamination. We apply this procedure also to our survey, taking\nthe stars within the polygon of Fig. 3 to be representative of\nthe desired signal, with a background sampled by the comparison field shown in Fig. 4. The matched-filter method\nassigns a relative weight to each star, according to its CMD\nlocation (the map of the matched-filter weights is displayed\nin the right-hand panel of Fig. 5). In this way it is more\nefficient than the methods used above to select the samples\n\"S1\" and \"S2\" since one can make use of the entire dataset.\nHowever, the drawback is that one must bin all quantities\nof interest, which is not always convenient. We therefore use\nall three methods, applying each where appropriate.\nFig. 7 shows the selection boxes used to investigate the\nspatial distribution of stars at other evolutionary phases\nwhich are clearly present from visual inspection of the CMD:\nthe blue and red horizontal branch (hereafter BHB and RHB\nrespectively), and the blue stragglers (hereafter BS). These\nboxes are defined from the (g-i,g) CMD. The spatial distribution of these selections are shown on Fig. 8, where we\ndisplay maps for the BHB, RHB and BS populations, which\ncontain 605, 2542 and 973 stars, respectively.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nANALYSIS\nStellar density profile\n\nWe next construct the stellar density profiles for the two\nselections. However, there are two practical problems that\n\nFigure 6.

The spatial distributions of the three selections, BHB,\nRHB and BS, are shown.\n\nneed to be solved. First, the survey is riddled with holes\ncaused by CCD artefacts around bright stars, so these unusable areas of the fields need to be masked out. We eliminated\ncircular regions around the positions of bright USNO and\nHipparcos stars which have magnitudes B < 16, choosing\nappropriate magnitude-dependent radii to cover the holes\nin the MegaCam survey. The second problem is the gaps\nbetween CCDs. The chipsets of the MegaCam camera are\ndistributed on four rows, with two large gaps. These gaps\n(which are clearly visible in Fig. 6) are sufficiently large to\ninfluence measurements of the stellar density profile.\nTo trace the stellar density profiles, we construct a succession of ellipses with different major axis values (throughout this work, we use s to denote an elliptical radius, and\nr to denote a circular radius). We choose the best shape\nparameters found by O01, a ellipticity equal to 0.30 and a\nposition angle of the major axis of 88\u25e6 . For each optimised\nselection, we construct the surface brightness profile, taking\ninto account the holes made by the bright stars and the gaps\nbetween CCDs, and remove a background level. The background count level is determined from the comparison field.\nIn Fig. 9 we show the resulting profiles before background\nsubtraction (upper panel) and after background subtraction\n(lower panel).\nWe next fit structural models to the S1 and S2 profiles\nand compare our results with O01 and Wilkinson et al. 2002\n(hereafter W02). We use three different models, the King\nmodel (King 1962):\n\u03a3(s) = \u03a30\n\n1\n\np\n\n1 + (s/Rc )2\n\n1\n\n\u2212p\n1 + (Rt /Rc )2\n\n!2\n\nthe exponential model (Sersic 1968):\n\u03a3(s) = \u03a30 exp(\u2212(s/R0 )n )\nand the Plummer model:\n\u03a3(s) = \u03a30 R0 /(1 + (s/R0 )2 )2 .\n\nThe fitting is performed by \u03c72 minimisation, with the\nellipticity and the position angle of the major axis taken as\n\nFigure 9.

The results are summarised in table 6, and the\ncorresponding profiles are displayed in Fig. 10.\nThe extensive spatial coverage of our survey provides us\nwith information far from the core of Draco, up to \u2248 100\u2032 .\nIn contrast to W04, who found a break at 25\u2032 in the light\nprofile with the INT dataset, the profiles on Fig. 9 based on\neither the S2 selection or from the matched-filter analysis do\nnot show evidence for a break. We suspect that the presence\nof the break in the W04 study could have been an artefact\nof background subtraction, which is very difficult at these\nlow count levels.\nThe fits of Fig. 10 give a visual impression that the data\ncan be represented quite well by these simple models. However, the reduced \u03c72 values listed in Table 6, are very poor,\nand even the best of the models (the exponential model fit\nto the Matched-Filter sample) can be rejected with better\nthan 99.99% confidence. Thus the data are now of such excellent quality that these simple models no longer provide\nsatisfactory fits. We suspect that dynamically self-consistent\ntriaxial models will be required to reproduce the structure\nof this dwarf galaxy, however that is beyond the scope of the\npresent article.\nWe also trace the stellar density profile for the BHB,\nRHB and BS selections.

The density profiles of the BHB (blue dashed line),\nRHB (red dotted line) and BS (black solid line) selections.\n\nRHB and BS selections. We find that widening the BHB\nbox by allowing redder horizontal-branch stars into the selection results in a profile that is closer to that of the RHB.\nThus the paucity of BHB stars does not allow us to confirm\nthe visual impression from Fig. 8 that the BHB stars are\nmore dispersed than the RHB and BS stars. Consequently,\nDraco, unlike the Sculptor (Tolstoy et al. 2004) and Fornax\n(Battaglia et al. 2006) dSph, does not possess a BHB population that is significantly more extended than the RHB\npopulation. Whether this attests to a difference in early\nstar-formation or simply to the low statistics of BHB stars\nis currently not clear.\n4.2\n\nFigure 10. Fits of a King (red), an exponential (green), and a\nPlummer (blue) model to the stellar density profiles derived from\nthe Matched-Filter sample (upper panel) the S2 sample (middle\npanel) and the S1 sample (lower panel). The error bars represent\n1\u03c3 uncertainties.\n\nSmoothness of the stellar density profile\n\nThe stellar profiles displayed in Fig. 10 appear approximately smooth, but are they really featureless\napart from their monotonic decrease? To investigate this\npoint we implement a variant of a test devised by\nKuhn, Kocevski & Fleck (2004) (hereafter KKF), who in a\npreliminary study of the stellar profile of the Draco dSph,\nfound the very interesting result that the inner regions\nwithin 20\u2032 are not as smooth as one would expect from Poisson noise statistics. Following KKF, we divide our MatchedFilter sample into 1000 radial bins, using the same elliptical coordinate as in Fig. 10. Each bin contains 24 stars to\nmaintain uniform statistical significance. However, since our\nsurvey suffers from gaps between CCDs and holes due to the\nhaloes of bright stars, we calculate the density \u03c1i in each bin\ni, and also the density uncertainty \u03b4\u03c1i , taking into account\nthe Poisson noise in each bin, and the Poisson noise in the\nbackground subtraction.\nIn a similar way to KKF, we take groups of 5 bins at\nradius Ri , and calculate the reduced \u03c72 of the group, testing the null-hypothesis that the density is constant over the\nsmall radial interval. To this end, we define:\n\u03c725 (Ri ) =\n\n4\n1 X (\u03c1i \u2212 \u03c1)2\n5\n\u03b4\u03c12i\nj=0\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the weighted mean density in the group of 5\nbins. Large values of \u03c725 would indicate large deviations from\n\n\fDraco, a flawless dwarf galaxy\n\nFigure 12. The colour-magnitude distribution of stars in the\nWFPC2 field. A CMD selection polygon is applied to these data\nto remove a small number of probable contaminants. The inset\nshows the spatial location of these stars at the centre of the dwarf\ngalaxy.\n\n9\n\nFigure 13. The stellar profile of the HST sample (uppermost\npoints), is compared to the profiled derived from the matchedfilter MegaCam sample, previously displayed in Fig. 9. The deeper\nHST data give better statistics in the galaxy centre, allowing us\nto probe the density profile down to s = 0\u2032.3.\n\nPoisson noise, and if many such bins were found, it would\nimply significant small spatial-scale variations in the density. However, contrary to KKF, we find that in the region\nwithin R < 20\u2032 the observed distribution of \u03c725 does not\ndiffer significantly from the expected distribution; indeed\na Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test indicates that the probability\nthat the observed distribution is drawn from the expected\n\u03c72 distribution is 2%. The hypothesis that the stellar profile\nof Draco is smooth on small-scales therefore cannot be confidently rejected. Since any defects in the survey that were\nnot accounted for in our processing will have the effect of\ndriving down this probability, one should interpret this test\nas evidence that the stellar profile is smooth.\n4.3\n\nThe central profile of Draco\n\nWe include the HST survey in this discussion of the spatial\nproperties of the Draco dSph, as the resulting deep photometry complements the wide-field MegaCam data, giving\nmuch better statistics in the centre of the galaxy. The CMD\nderived from the point-sources in the much deeper WFPC2\ndata is shown in Fig. 12. (We define point sources to be\nthose objects in Table 5 that have \u03c7 < 1.5 and sharpness\nbetween 0 and 0.2 in both the V and i-bands). The main\nsequence turnoff and part of the RGB and HB are clearly\nvisible. In this central region of the dwarf galaxy, the number\nof contaminants to the point-source catalogue is very small,\nbut we choose to implement a simple CMD selection box (as\nshown in Fig. 12) around the stellar populations of Draco\nto avoid the obvious contamination. The selection inside the\npolygon contains a total of 1122 stars.\nWe now trace the surface density profile of this selection of HST stars. We divide the sample into 11 bins each\ncontaining 102 stars, and as with the MegaCam dataset,\nwe compute the stellar density taking into account the gaps\nbetween the CCDs. Fig. 13 compares the stellar density profiles of Draco obtained with the HST data to the MegaCam\nmatched-filter selection. In Fig. 14 we show more clearly the\n\nFigure 14. The stellar density profile of the central regions of\nthe Draco dSph, as measured from the HST survey. Each bin has\n102 stars. For comparison, with the dashed line we display the expected projected density profile of an NFW model of Virial Mass\n108 M\u2299 and concentration c = 28.6 (the density normalisation\nhas been chosen to minimise the \u03c72 fit to the data). The dotted\nline shows the profile of an NFW model with c = 4.5. The full line\nshows the exponential model fit previously in the upper panel of\nFig. 10 (but suitably normalised to minimise \u03c72 ).\n\nregion probed by the HST data; the higher source density results simply from the greater photometric depth. The mean\nstar-count level in the HST survey is 296 \u00b1 41 arcmin\u22122 ,\nhowever the probability that these density are constant with\nradius is 0.8%. Thus the profile derived from the HST starcounts requires that the stellar density in the inner regions\nof the galaxy continue to increase towards the centre.\nIn cosmological simulations, dark matter halos follow\na \"universal\" profile, like the NFW (Navarro et al. 1997)\nor Moore (Moore et al. 1999) models. Though these models\nwork well on large scales such as those of galaxy clusters,\nthe question about the form of the inner regions of low-mass\n\n\f10\n\nMathieu S\u00e9gall, Rodrigo Ibata, Michael Irwin, N., F. Martin & Scott Chapman\n\ndark matter halos is not resolved: are their centres cuspy or\ncored (de Blok et al. 2001)? Though the distribution of the\nluminous matter need not follow that of the underlying dark\nhalo, it is nevertheless interesting to compare the observed\ndistribution of stars to the expected dark matter models.\nIn Fig. 14 we compare the observed central stellar number density profile to a cusped profile model, that we choose\nto parametrise with a projected NFW model of mass 108 M\u2299\n(Lokas & Mamon 2001). We adopt a normalisation to minimise \u03c72 , so that the only free parameter is the concentration c of the NFW model. The mean concentration of a halo\nof this mass is c = 28.6 (Macci\u00f2 et al. 2006); this model is\nshown with a dashed line, and has a probability of only 0.1%\nof conforming to the data. However, there is a wide range\nin the concentration of cosmological halos, with a typical\nscatter of 0.4 in log(c) (Macci\u00f2 et al. 2006). The dotted line\nshows a fit for c = 4.5, an extreme (2\u03c3) value for halos of\nmass 108 M\u2299 . The probability that the observed profile can\nbe drawn from such a model is 8%.\nThe marginal discrepancy between the NFW models\nand the data stems solely from the innermost point of the\nsurvey. We have checked this datum carefully, and could find\nno artificial reason why it should be substantially lower than\nthe trend. This may reveal a real departure due to a change\nin the mass to light ratio of the central regions, though it\nmay also simply point to the possibility that the centre of\nthe dwarf galaxy is not precisely at the location measured\nby O01. Their centroid resulted from a fit to the data over\nthe entire galaxy, so it is reasonable that there could be\n\u2032\nan offset in the very central 0.3.\nIndeed, this is perfectly\n\u2032\nconsistent with the quoted uncertainty of 0.3\nin the O01\ncentroid position. The MegaCam survey, due to the large\ngaps between CCDs, is not well suited to improve on the\nO01 centroid measurement, and neither is the HST survey\npresented here due to its very limited spatial coverage. If\nwe omit the innermost datum, the probability that the HST\nprofile is drawn from a c = 28.6 or a c = 4.5 model is 48%\nand 14%, respectively.\nNevertheless, it is interesting in this context that the\nsimple exponential model that we fit earlier to the MatchedFilter sample provides a good representation to the data,\nincluding the innermost datum. This is shown with the full\nline in Fig. 14, where we have simply scaled the previous fit\nto best match the observed profile. The probability that the\ndata are drawn from this exponential model is 26%, while\nrejecting the innermost point yields a probability of 28%.\n4.4\n\nSearch for tidal features\n\nOne of the particularities of the Draco dSph based on previous studies of this system is its undisturbed appearance.\nTo try to place better constraints on the absence of tidallyinduced features we count the number of stars at radii between 45\u2032 < R < 120\u2032 probing beyond the King model tidal\nradius to the end of the survey. Each annulus is divided\ninto 36 equal parts, and we count the number of stars in\neach annulus segment. In Fig. 15 we show the backgroundsubtracted star-counts and their 1\u03c3 uncertainties in each annulus segment for the S2 selection. None of these 10\u25e6 -wide\nbins exceeds 1\u03c3, so we conclude that no significant overdensities are detected.\nTo test the sensitivity of this method, we make fake tidal\n\nFigure 15. Counts in azimuthal bins around the Draco dSph\n(the error bars represent 1\u03c3 uncertainties) for stars beyond 45\u2032 .\nThe data are drawn from the \"S2\" selection, which is appropriate\nfor the outer regions of the survey.\n\ntails by redistributing a fraction of the stars from the central\nregion of the galaxy along the direction of the major axis of\nthe galaxy. For every randomly drawn star from within a\n20\u2032 radius of the galaxy centre, we randomly reassign the\ncoordinate along the major axis of the galaxy so as to have\na constant density stream over the length of the surveyed\nregion. With a tidal tail representing 3% of the selection\nof the central stars, we are able to detect the tail at 4.9\u03c3\n(summing two bins around 0\u25e6 ) and 3.3\u03c3 (from summing\ntwo bins around 180\u25e6 ). This result indicates that a tidal\ntail consisting of only 3% of the central body of Draco is\ndetectable by this method.\nThe absence of any other deformities in the outskirts of\nthe galaxy is further corroborated by the stellar density map\nin Fig. 16, which has been constructed from the matchedfilter sample. The uncertainty contours at the 1, 3 and 5\u03c3\nlevels are also shown. These data clearly show that Draco is\na very regular and symmetric system.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe inner density profile\n\nThe HST survey presented above shows clearly that the inner stellar density profile increases inwards until at least\n\u2032\n0.5.\nInside that radius, the profile may flatten or decline,\nor we may simply have adopted a slightly incorrect centroid. The current data are not good enough to discriminate between these possibilities. CDM simulations show\ndark matter profiles with a power-law slope between -1 and\n-1.5, as shown by numerous recent studies (Col\u0131\u0300n et al. 2004;\nGhigna et al. 2000; Hayashi et al. 2003). However, low surface brightness galaxies appear to have flat central mass\nprofiles (de Blok et al. 2001), in stark contradiction to the\ntheoretical predictions. These authors also show that the\nprofiles are better fit with a model with a power-law index\nof \u22120.2 \u00b1 0.2.\nA flat central density profile has also been deduced for\n\n\fDraco, a flawless dwarf galaxy\n\nFigure 16. Matched-filter map of the MegaCam survey region,\nshown on a logarithmic scale and over the same spatial region as\nin Fig. 6. The lines show significance contours of the signal to\nnoise ratio at 1, 3 and 5\u03c3.\n\nare as yet unavailable in sufficient numbers to allow a measure of the velocity dispersion, let alone its gradient. (The\npaucity of kinematic data is due to the low surface number\ndensity of bright giant stars needed for spectroscopic observations). Nevertheless, a clear flattening of the starcounts\nin the central regions of the galaxy away from an NFW\nmodel would have lent support to the presence of a core in\nthe Draco dSph. Similarly, if the stars were found to follow\nan NFW profile into the very central regions it would call\ninto question the possibility that the dark matter is cored\nin this dwarf galaxy. Unfortunately, the uncertainty in the\nposition of the centroid of the galaxy does not allow us to\ndraw a clear conclusion on this matter. If we do not include\nthe innermost datum, the HST data follow an NFW model\nclosely. Including the innermost datum forces us to accept\na model with a flat inner profile like the exponential model\nshown in Fig. 14. Further observational work is required to\nmeasure accurately the position of the centre of the dwarf\ngalaxy, and to improve on the statistics of the starcounts in\nthe central few arcmins.\n5.2\n\nthe Ursa Minor dSph, from an analysis of the survivability\nof a morphological substructure (Kleyna et al. 2003). They\nfound that the stars of this substructure are dynamically\ncolder than the stellar population of the dwarf galaxy, concluding that the substructure was a stellar cluster accreted\nby Ursa Minor, and whose stars now orbit unbound inside\nthe halo of the dwarf galaxy. They demonstrated that this\ntype of scenario is only possible if the dark matter profile\naround Ursa Minor has a flat core, as otherwise the stars\nrapidly lose their coherence.\nSome numerical simulations (Ricotti & Wilkinson\n2004) can produce dark matter halos with flat cores in\nagreement with those observations. In their cosmological\nsimulations, Ricotti & Wilkinson (2004) created this type of\nhalo at z \u2265 10, by taking into account the effect of radiative\npressure. They are able to produce galactic systems similar\nto the Local Group. To make this, they selected at z = 10\ngalaxies with cored dark matter halos. Then they evolved\nwithout any peroid of fusion. The main result is the core of\neach dwarf galaxy remains flat and stable until z = 0. The\nmodelled velocity dispersion profile was found to have the\nsame shape as those found observationally by Kleyna et al.\n(2002). Another method to obtain dark matter halos with\nflat core was proposed by Read & Gilmore (2005). They\ndiscovered it is possible to flatten the core of a potential\nby two short periods of mass-loss, separated by a phase\nof reaccretion of gas. Recently, Mashchenko et al. (2006)\nshowed that the CDM cusp may be removed for halos in\nthe 107 to 1010 M\u2299 range by including stellar feedback into\nthe simulations.\nClearly our starcounts are not directly measuring the\ndark matter profile; the stellar profile will have resulted\nfrom a complex interplay between baryons and the dark\nmatter. With complementary kinematic measurements we\ncould hope to use the Jeans equations to disentangle the\ntwo. However, though samples of several hundred stars are\nnow being obtained in this galaxy Wilkinson et al. (2004),\nthe HST photometry we have analysed above probes the interesting very inner parts of the system, where kinematics\n\n11\n\nAbsence of tidal effects\n\nWe have searched for tidal disturbances in the outer parts of\nthe Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy, using a stellar selection\ndesigned to optimise the signal to noise ratio in regions of low\ncontrast. However, no evidence was found for the presence of\nan extra-tidal population, and we limit the fraction of such\na component to less than 3% within the spatial extent of the\nMegaCam survey. This result, in conjunction with the finding that the surface brightness profile is consistent with that\nof an unperturbed dynamical system, suggests that Draco\nhas led a quiet existence. This finding also lends support\nto models in which the stars are shielded by a dark matter\nmini-halo from the tidal forces of the Milky Way.\nA similar conclusion about the non-detection of tidal\nstreams in Draco has been made by Klessen et al. (2003),\nwho studied the properties of blue horizontal branch stars\nin Draco with the SDSS dataset. They choose this stellar population because it is distributed all over Draco and\nthe contamination by other astronomical objetcs is minimal. Their surface brightness profile of this stellar population does not possess any break, in agreement with our\nmuch deeper MegaCam results presented here. They completed this study with a numerical simulation of the dwarf\ngalaxy, without a dark matter component and affected by\nthe tidal effects of the Milky Way. By comparing the morphology of the simulation to the observations of the horizontal branch of Draco, they concluded that such a purely\nbaryonic model is not compatible with reality. Their numerical simulations show a wide horizontal branch that is not\nobserved for Draco. Thus Klessen et al. (2003) conclude that\nDraco is not a renmant of a tidally disrupted galaxy, but a\ndwarf galaxy with a substantial dark matter halo.\nThe fact that we find no tidal stream is not altogether unexpected. Mayer et al. (2002) conducted cosmological simulations to attempt to model the behaviour of dwarf\ngalaxies with tidal debris, such as the Carina dSph. They\nfound that to reproduce this type of galaxy, the dark matter halo must have a flat core or else it can possess a steep\ninner profile but with very low concentration (< 7). If the\nconcentration is higher, the orbits must be highly tangential\n\n\f12\n\nMathieu S\u00e9gall, Rodrigo Ibata, Michael Irwin, N., F. Martin & Scott Chapman\n\nto reproduce the observations. In the case of dwarf galaxies\nwith high mass-to-light ratio, like Draco or Ursa Minor, they\nshowed that it is difficult to create large tidal streams. Only\nsmall tidal features could be formed, but at low contrast.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented a study of the structure of the Draco\ndwarf spheroidal galaxy, using photometric data obtained\nwith the MegaCam camera on the CFHT telescope and the\nWFPC2 camera aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. These\ntwo datasets give us a new detailed view of this small galaxy.\nOur deep photometry allows us to probe further than\nprevious studies into the heart and the outskirts of the dwarf\ngalaxy. We find that the central stellar density increases in\u2032\nwards from \u223c 2\u2032 to 0.5.\nWe find reasonable agreement if\nwe choose to model the central HST stellar profile with a\ncusped model, parametrised as a projected NFW model of\n\u2032\nmass 108 M\u2299 . Inside 0.5\nthe profile appears to flatten out,\nor drop, though this may be an artefact of adopting an incorrect value for the position of the centre of the galaxy.\nHowever, we find that an exponential model gives an equally\ngood description of the data.\nThe derived stellar profile is very smooth on large scales\nand does not appear to have a break, contrary to some previous claims. We also do not find evidence to support a claim\nthat the stellar distribution is clumpy on small scales. We fit\nthe stellar profile with various simple models, and improve\nslightly the model parameters compared to earlier studies.\nHowever, neither a King model, an exponential or a Plummer model give satisfactory fits to the observed profile over\nthe entirety of the galaxy. The data depart slightly from each\nof these idealised models, and we are forced to reject them\nall at high confidence. However, this discrepancy is more a\ntestament to the outstanding quality of the data. A more\nrefined model will have to be developed to properly model\nthese data; this is however beyond the scope of the present\npaper.\nWe also search for possible tidal substructures in the\noutskirts of the dwarf galaxy. No evidence for the presence\nof a tidal stream is found. Monte-Carlo tests show that if any\nsuch structure is present it cannot represent more than 3% of\nthe main body of the system. Thus we find that Draco is an\nundisturbed system, most likely in dynamical equilibrium.\nThe Draco dSph therefore continues to be an excellent target\nfor studies of the dark matter on small scales.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank the staff at the CFHT telescope for\nobserving and processing the MegaCam data, and for their\nkind help at many stages during the progress of this work.\n\nREFERENCES\nApparicio, A., Carrera, R., Martinez-Delgado, D. 2001, AJ\n122, 2524\nBattaglia, G., et al. 2006, astro-ph/0608370\nBellazzini, M., Ferraro, F., Origlia, L., Pancino, E.,\nMonaco, L.
