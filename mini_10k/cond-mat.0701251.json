With the possible exception of the quark\ngluon plasma, this value is closer to the conjectured lower bound 1/(4\u03c0) than any other known\nliquid.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nStrongly correlated quantum systems play an important role in many different areas of physics. Systems of\ninterest in atomic, condensed matter, and nuclear physics\nspan many orders of magnitude in energy scale but exhibit a number of universal properties. Recently there\nhas been renewed interest in the transport properties of\nstrongly correlated systems. Experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) indicate that at temperatures close to the critical temperature Tc the quark\ngluon plasma is strongly interacting. The strongly interacting quark gluon plasma (sQGP) is characterized by a\nvery small shear viscosity to entropy ratio, a small heavy\nquark diffusion coefficient, and a large opacity for high\nenergy jets [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\nFrom a theoretical point of view not much is known\nabout transport coefficients of strongly correlated systems. If the interaction is weak then the mean free path\nand the shear viscosity are large. As the strength of the\ninteraction increases the mean free path and the viscosity\ndrop but there are good reasons to believe that the shear\nviscosity always remains finite. Kovtun et al. conjectured\nthat there is a universal lower bound \u03b7/s \u2265 h\u0304/(4\u03c0kB ) [6].\nHere, \u03b7 is the shear viscosity, s is the entropy density, h\u0304\nis Planck's constant and kB is the Boltzmann constant.\nThe bound is saturated in the case of strongly coupled\ngauge theories that have a dual description in terms of a\ngravitational theory.\nIn this work we test the viscosity bound conjecture\nby extracting \u03b7/s from experimental data on the damping of collective oscillations of a cold atomic gas near a\nFeshbach resonance. Cold atomic gases provide an ideal\nsystem to test the conjecture because both the temperature and the interaction can be continuously adjusted.\nAlso, because of universality, atoms in the unitarity limit\nare equivalent to other Fermi liquids with a large scattering length like dilute neutron matter. Collective modes\nin the atomic system have been studied in a number of\nexperiments [7, 8, 9, 10]. In the weak coupling regime\nthe frequency and damping constant of collective modes\ncan be understood in terms of the Boltzmann equation.\nIn the unitarity limit the frequency of collective modes\nis well described by ideal hydrodynamics [11, 12, 13]. In\nthe present work we include viscous corrections and use\n\nexperimental and quantum Monte Carlo data on the thermodynamics to extract \u03b7/s. Previous studies of damping\nnear the unitarity limit can be found in [14, 15, 16].\nII.\n\nEULER HYDRODYNAMICS\n\nWe shall assume that the system is approximately described by ideal (Eulerian) fluid dynamics.

We have\nused the calibration curve in [18] to convert the T\u0303 scale of [8]\nto T /TF .\n\nwhere \u03c9\u0304 = (\u03c91 \u03c92 \u03c93 )1/3 . Consider small oscillations\nn = n0 + \u03b4n.

Nontrivial solutions correspond to det(M ) = 0. In the case of\na trapping potential with axial symmetry, \u03c91 = \u03c92 = \u03c90 ,\n\u03c93 = \u03bb\u03c90 , we get \u03c9 2 = 2\u03c902 and [11, 12, 13]\n\u001a\n\u03b3+2 2\n\u03bb\n(9)\n\u03c9 2 = \u03c902 \u03b3 + 1 +\n2\n)\nr\n(\u03b3 + 2)2 4\n2\n2\n2\n\u00b1\n\u03bb + (\u03b3 \u2212 3\u03b3 \u2212 2)\u03bb + (\u03b3 + 1) .\n4\n\nIn the unitarity limit (\u03b3 = 2/3) and for a very asymmetric\ntrap, \u03bb \u2192 0, the eigenfrequencies are \u03c9 2 = 2\u03c902 and\n\u03c9 2 = (10/3)\u03c902. The mode \u03c9 2 = (10/3)\u03c902 is a radial\nbreathing mode with ~a = (a, a, 0) and the mode \u03c9 2 = 2\u03c902\ncorresponds to a radial quadrupole ~a = (a, \u2212a, 0).\nIII.\n\nVISCOUS CORRECTIONS\n\nThe energy dissipated due to viscous effects is\n\u00132\n\u0012\nZ\n2\n1\n3\nd x \u03b7(x) \u2202i vj + \u2202j vi \u2212 \u03b4ij \u2202k vk (10)\n\u0116 = \u2212\n2\n3\nZ\n\u0001\n2\n\u2212 d3 x \u03b6(x) \u2202i vi ,\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the shear viscosity and \u03b6 is the bulk viscosity. In the unitarity limit the system is scale invariant\nand the bulk viscosity in the normal phase vanishes. The\nsituation is more complicated in the superfluid phase.\nIn this case the normal and superfluid components can\nflow independently and in addition to the shear viscosity there are three bulk viscosities \u03b6i . Two of the three\nbulk viscosities, \u03b61 and \u03b62 , can be shown to vanish as a\nconsequence of scale invariance [19]. The third bulk viscosity, \u03b63 , only contributes to dissipation if the normal\ncomponents is moving relative to the superfluid [20]. In\nthe following we shall consider modes in which the two\ncomponents move in phase and ignore bulk viscosity. We\nwill also assume that the viscosity only depends on x\nthrough the local density and temperature. This is valid\nif the density and temperature are varying slowly, and is\nconsistent with the local density approximation for the\ndensity profile. We note that in this approximation the\nequation of state and the transport coefficients reflect the\nconformal invariance of the microscopic dynamics, even\nthough scale invariance is broken by the external potential.\nFor the radial scaling flows given in equ. (9) we have\nZ\n\u0001\n2 2\n2\nd3 x \u03b7(x),\n(11)\n\u0116 = \u2212 ax + ay \u2212 ax ay\n3\n\nwhere E is a time average. The damping rate is determined by the ratio of the energy dissipated to the total\nenergy of the collective mode. The kinetic energy is\nZ\n\u0001\nmN 2\nm\nax + a2y hx2 i. (12)\nd3 x n(x)~v 2 =\nEkin =\n2\n2\n2\nAt T = 0 we find hx2 i = R\u22a5\n/8, where R\u22a5 is the transverse size of the cloud. At non-zero temperature we can\nuse the Virial theorem [21] to relate hx2 i to the total energy of the equilibrium state, hx2 i/hx2 iT =0 = E/ET =0 .\nThe damping rate is [15, 22]\n\nR\n1 \u0116\n2 a2x + a2y \u2212 ax ay d3 x \u03b7(x)\n\u2212\n=\n.\n2E\n3\na2x + a2y\nmN hx2 i\n\n(13)\n\nNote that the second factor on the RHS is 1/2 for the radial breathing mode and 3/2 for the radial quadrupole\nmode. If this dependence could be demonstrated experimentally, it would confirm that the damping is indeed dominated by shear stress. Another possibility is\nto compare the breathing mode with a scissors mode.\nThe scissors mode is characterized by the velocity field\n~\n~v = a\u2207(xy).\nThe frequency is \u03c9 2 = \u03c9x2 + \u03c9y2 and the\nsecond factor in equ. (13) is 6.\nFor the unitary Fermi gas the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density is given by universal function that depends only on the ratio T /TF , \u03b7(\u03bc, T ) =\n\u03b1(T /TF )s(\u03bc, T ). Here, the Fermi temperature is given\nby TF = (3\u03c0 2 n)2/3 /(2m). In the local density approximation this implies that \u03b7(x) = \u03b1(T /TF (x))s(x), where\nTF (x) is the local Fermi temperature. We shall assume\n\n\f3\n1.6\n\n\u03b7/s\n\nHere, \u03b8 denotes the angle between ds and the z-axis.\nIdeally, the hydrodynamic description inside the surface\nr0 (\u03b8) should be coupled to kinetic theory outside this\nsurface. In this work we shall be less ambitious and use\nequ. (16) in order to estimate the systematic uncertainty\nin our determination of \u03b7/s. For this purpose we compute\nthe contribution to \u0116 in equ. (13) that comes from atoms\noutside r0 (\u03b8) and treat it as a systematic error in the\ndamping rate.\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nV.\n\nTHERMODYNAMICS\n\nT /TF\nFIG. 2: Viscosity to entropy density ratio of a cold atomic\ngas in the unitarity limit.

In this regime the density is low and the\nmean free path can be estimated using kinetic theory. In\nthe limit n \u226a (mT )3/2 the mean free path is given by\n[16]\nlmfp = (n\u03c3)\u22121 ,\n\n\u03c3=\n\n1\n4\u03c0\n.\n3 mkB T\n\n(15)\n\nFollowing [22] we can define a surface r0 (\u03b8) by the condition that a particle incident from the exterior of the\ncloud has a chance of no larger than 1/e of colliding with\nanother particle\nZ \u221e\nds\n1=\n.\n(16)\nr)\nr0 (\u03b8) lmfp (~\n\nExperimental results for \u0393/\u03c9 are shown in Fig. (1).\nIn order to extract \u03b7/s we also need information on the\nentropy per particle. In the unitarity limit there are only\ntwo energy scales in the problem, the chemical potential \u03bc\nand the thermal energy kB T (in the following we will set\nkB to one). The associated density scales are nf (\u03bc) and\n\u03bbT\u22123 , where nf (\u03bc) = (2m\u03bc)3/2 /(3\u03c0 2 ) is the density of a\nfree Fermi gas and \u03bbT = (2\u03c0mT )\u22121/2 is the thermal wave\nlength. All thermodynamic quantities can be expressed\nas suitable powers of either nf (\u03bc) or \u03bb3T times a function\nof the dimensionless quantity y = T /\u03bc. For example, we\ncan write the pressure as [24]\nP (\u03bc, T ) =\n\n2\n2\n\u03bcnf (\u03bc)G(y) = T \u03bb\u22123\nW(y \u22121 ) ,\n5\n5 T\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the first form is more useful at small T and the second at high T . Using standard thermodynamic identities\none can show that\nn(\u03bc, T ) = nf (\u03bc)F (y),\n2\ns(\u03bc, T ) = nf (\u03bc)G \u2032 (y),\n5\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nwhere n is the density, s is the entropy density, and\nF (y) = G(y) \u2212 2yG \u2032 (y)/5. At T = 0 the function\nG(y) is related to the parameter \u03be introduced above,\nG(0) = \u03be \u22123/2 . The functions G(y), F (y) refer to the\nbulk system. Trapped systems can be described using\nthe local density approximation. Experiments typically\ninvolve 105 \u2212 106 atoms and the local density approximation is very accurate. The density of the trapped system\nis\nn0 (x) = n (\u03bc \u2212 V (x), T ) ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere V (x) is the trapping potential. Similar relations\nhold for the energy and entropy density. For T = 0\nequ. (20) reduces to equ. (5).\nThe function G(y) can be extracted from quantum\nMonte Carlo data or from calorimetric experiments with\ntrapped fermions. A number of Monte Carlo calculations\nhave appeared over the last couple of years [25, 26, 27],\nbut there are still significant disagreements between the\nresults. Burovski et al. find Tc /TF = 0.152(7) and a\ncritical entropy per particle S/N = 0.16(2) [26]. Bulgac et al. quote Tc /TF = 0.23(2) and S/N \u2243 1.1 [27].\n\n\f4\n\nIn Fig. 2 we show \u03b7/s extracted using both the damping data and the calorimetry from the Duke group. We\nobserve that \u03b7/s is small (\u223c 0.5) near Tc and slowly\ngrows with temperature for T > Tc . The value of \u03b7/s\nnear Tc is about six times larger than the conjectured\nviscosity bound and consistent with the picture of a very\nstrongly correlated liquid. Indeed, the extracted value\n\u03b7/s \u223c 0.5 is smaller than the previously known minimum\nfor all other liquids, \u03b7/s \u223c 0.7 for liquid Helium near the\nlambda point [6]. Even smaller values of \u03b7/s have been\nreported for the quark gluon plasma produced at RHIC,\nbut the uncertainties remain large [2, 28]. We note that\nthe systematic uncertainty near the minimum is small,\nbut that it increases as a function of temperature.\nThere are a number of issues that need to be addressed\nin more detail. We argued that it is important to establish that shear viscosity is indeed the dominant damping\nmechanism. This can be done either by studying the dependence of the damping time on the type of collective\n\nmode, or by studying the dependence on system size. Kinast et al. collected some data on system size dependence\nbelow Tc and find that \u0393/\u03c9\u22a5 is roughly independent of\nthe number of particles [8]. This is not consistent with\nthe scaling in equ. (14). Data on system size dependence\ncan also be used to determine at what point hydrodynamics is breaking down.\nIt is also important to understand the damping mechanism below Tc in more detail. The data show a very simple linear behavior in the variable T\u0303 \u223c (T /TF )2/3 . The\nnatural framework for understanding the damping mechanism in the regime below Tc is superfluid (two-fluid)\nhydrodynamics [20]. There are several sound modes in\nsuperfluid hydrodynamics. First sound is an excitation\nin which the superfluid and normal components move together, whereas second sound corresponds to an oscillation of the superfluid component against the normal one.\nThe damping of first sound is governed by the shear stress\nof the normal component. It is likely that the collective\nexcitations that have been observed experimentally are\nordinary (first) sound modes, but it is not obvious why\nthe damping constant is linear in T\u0303 . We should note that\na linear behavior was observed in trapped Bose gases [29],\nwhere it was attributed to Landau damping by normal\nexcitations [30].\nFinally, there are a number of technical aspects of our\nanalysis that should be improved. We have assumed that\nthe quantity \u03b1 = \u03b7/s is only weakly temperature dependent. Near the the minimum of \u03b7/s this is a good\napproximation, but at higher temperature the uncertainty inherent in this approximation grows, as does the\nuncertainty related to the breakdown of hydrodynamics near the the surface of the cloud. In this regime a\nBoltzmann description should be used. In the present\nwork we have neglected dissipation due to temperature\ngradients and thermal conductivity. This is expected\nto be a good approximation for scaling flows because\noscillations in density are proportional to the equilibrium density \u03b4n(x) \u223c n0 (x). For isentropic oscillations\n\u03b4T \u223c (\u03b4n/n)T and to leading order no temperature gradients are present.\nAcknowledgments: This work is supported in part\nby the US Department of Energy grant DE-FG0203ER41260.

Lett.\n\nUsing the local density approximation the results of Bulgac et al. correspond to a critical entropy per particle of\nS/N \u2243 2.1 for the trapped system. The reason that the\nentropy per particle is larger in a trapped system is that\nthe density near the edges is smaller, and therefore the\ndimensionless temperature mT /n2/3 larger.\nThe Duke group has performed a series of calorimetric\nmeasurements [18, 23]. Kinast et al. [18] provide a simple\nparametrization of the energy of the trapped system as\na function of t = T /TF . The result is\n\u001a\n1 + 97.3 t3.73 t < tc ,\n(21)\nE = E0\n1 + 4.98 t1.43 t > tc ,\nwith E0 = 0.53EF and Tc /TF = 0.29(2). Luo et al. [23]\ngive a similar parametrization of the entropy,\n\u001a\n4.6 (e \u2212 e0 )0.61 e < ec ,\n(22)\nS/N =\n4.0 (e \u2212 e0 )0.45 e > ec ,\nwhere e = E/EF . The critical entropy per particle is\nS/N = 2.7, roughly compatible with the Monte Carlo\nresults of Bulgac et al., but significantly larger than the\nresults of Burovski et al.\nVI.\n\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\n\f5\n94, 170404 (2005) [cond-mat/0502507].\n[9] M.
