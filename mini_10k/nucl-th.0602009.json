The failure of the\nhadronic models to reproduce the absolute magnitude of the observed v2 indicates that\ntransport calculations of heavy ion collisions at RHIC must incorporate interactions\namong quarks and gluons in the early, hot and dense phase.

Introduction\nThe main goal of high energy nuclear collisions is the exploration of QCD-matter at\nhigh temperatures and densities. The search for a new form of matter consisting of\ndeconfined quarks and gluons as constituents (usually called the Quark-Gluon-Plasma,\nQGP) has been a focal point of theoretical and experimental studies over the last decade\n[1]. Measurements of the collective motion of hadrons produced in high-energy nuclear\ncollisions have long been suggested as a valuable tool to gain information about the\nnature of the constituents and the equation of state of the system in the early stage of the\nreaction [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Specifically, strange and multi-strange hadron elliptic\nand radial flow results seem to indicate that the observed collectivity originates from\na partonic phase\u2021 [11]. Furthermore, elliptic and radial flow measurements for heavyflavor hadrons like J/\u03a8 and D mesons will test the hypothesis of early thermalization\nin these collisions [12, 13, 14].\nAt RHIC, measurements [15, 16] of the elliptic flow v2 and the nuclear modification\nfactor RAA,CP for identified particles have led to the conclusion that hadrons ought to be\nformed via the coalescence or recombination of massive quarks [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,\n24, 25]. A cornerstone of this conclusion is the observed number-of-constituent-quark\n(NCQ-) scaling of the flow of baryons vs. mesons. Because this interpretation addresses\nkey issues in high-energy nuclear collisions such as deconfinement and chiral symmetry\nrestoration, it is of utmost importance to conduct a systematic study of other possible\nexplanations for the observed particle type dependencies.\nFor the present analysis we employ two independent hadron-string transport models\nRQMD(v2.4) and UrQMD(v2.2) [26, 27] to study the effect of hadronic cross sections,\nkinematics etc. on the particle type dependence of v2 . We present the v2 values of \u03c0,\n\u221a\nK, p, \u039b, \u039e and \u03a9 for Au+Au collisions at sNN = 200 GeV. We find that - although\nthe hadronic models give only 60% of the magnitude of v2 - both models reproduce\nthe gross features of the particle type dependence, including the mass ordering at\npT < 1 GeV/c and the number-of-constituent-quark dependence at pT > 1 GeV/c.\nWithin both models, the NCQ dependence is related to the additive-quark-model for\nhadronic cross-sections. These findings imply that detailed comparisons between data\nand theory are necessary to disentangle hadronic and partonic effects at intermediate\ntransverse momenta, 1.5 GeV/c < pT < 5 GeV/c. For a transport model discussion\nof the quantitative accuracy and validity of the various methods to extract elliptic flow\nvalues from the data, the reader is referred to [7, 8, 9]\nAs one can observe from Fig. 1 the build-up of the elliptic flow in these models is\ntightly connected to the hadron+hadron scattering rate (top/bottom figures on the lhs.).\nInitial valence (di-)quark scatterings before 1 fm/c do only yield a negligible amount of\nv2 . The right panels in Fig. 1 show the time evolution of the elliptic flow for mesons and\nbaryons for low pT (bottom) and high pT (top). Already at early times, a separation\nbetween meson and baryon elliptic flow is visible, leading to the mass hierarchy at low\n\u2021 The term partonic is used to denote any kind of deconfined matter made of quarks and gluons.\n\n\f3\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\n0.035\n\n0.07\n\n0.03\n\n0.06\n\n0.025\n\n0.05\n\nv2\n\nv2\n\nAnisotropic flow at RHIC\n\n0.02\n0.015\n\n0.03\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.005\n\nhadron+hadron\nq/diq+hadron\nq/diq+q/diq\n\nmesons, pt > 2 GeV\nbaryons\n\n0.025\n\n200\n\n0.02\n\nv2\n\ndNcoll/dt [fm ]\n\n0.01\n\nmesons\nbaryons\n\n250\n\n-1\n\n0.04\n\n150\n\n0.015\n\n100\n\n0.01\n\n50\n\n0.005\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\nmesons, pt < 1 GeV\nbaryons\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nt [fm]\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nt [fm]\n\n\u221a\nFigure 1.

Model Results\nWithin the framework of the hadronic transport approach, a typical heavy ion collision\nproceeds schematically in three stages, i.e. the pre-hadronic (strings and constituent\n(di-)quarks) stage, the hadronic pre-equilibrium stage, the evolution towards hadronic\nkinetic equilibrium and freeze-out. The pre-hadronic stage involves the initial excitation\nand fragmentation of color strings and ropes. At the highest RHIC energy, this stage\nlasts for about 0.5-1.5 fm/c and the effective transverse pressure/EOS is rather soft.\nDuring the late hadronic stage, the hadronic system approaches local kinetic equilibrium\nfollowed by an approach to free-streaming, where the system escapes equilibrium due to\ndilution of the hadronic gas: the mean free path of the hadrons exceeds the finite size of\nthe system [26, 27, 28], the free streaming hadrons decay and feed down to the lightest\nspecies.\n\n\f4\n\nAnisotropic flow at RHIC\n\n\u2212\u2212\n\nAu + Au at \u221asNN=200 GeV\n\n0.08\n\nv2\n\ndefault\nno res.\nUrQMD(v2.2)\n\n0.04\n\ndefault\n\n0.02\n\n//models/feng25/v2_rqmd/plot2_22aug04//\n\nSTAR\nRQMD(v2.4)\n\n0.06\n\n0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nNumber of participants Npart\n\nFigure 2. Charged hadron v2 versus the number of participating nucleons in Au+Au\n\u221a\ninteractions at sNN = 200 GeV. Experimental data [29, 30] from the 4-particle\ncumulant method is shown as stars. RQMD results are depicted by filled circles (full\ncalculation) and open circles (without rescattering). The UrQMD calculations are\nshown as open triangles.\n\nFigure 2 presents the model results on the centrality dependence of the charged\nhadron v2 -values along with measurements from the STAR collaboration [29, 30]. Both\nhadronic transport models (UrQMD v2.2 and RQMD v2.4) reach about 60% of the\nmeasured v2 values only, although the centrality dependencies are very similar to the\ndata. There is a small variance between the two models, which we consider as an\nestimate of the systematic errors in such model calculations. Although the v2 values\nfrom the hadronic transport model also depend on the formation-time of hadrons from\nstrings [7], the failure of both hadronic transport models to describe quantitatively\nthe magnitude of v2 is a strong indication that there are interactions amongst prehadronic constituents (partons) present in nature (but not in the hadron-string models\ndiscussed here), which are responsible for the large v2 values observed in the experiments\n[31, 32, 33]. When rescattering between the hadrons is turned off (full circles), v2\nvanishes completely, because repulsive vector interactions are not included into the\npresent simulations [2, 3, 7].\nLet us now analyze the temporal structure of the elliptic flow's development.\nFigure 3 shows the v2 values as a function of the freeze-out time for pions in minimum\n\u221a\nbiased Au+Au interactions at sNN = 200 GeV. The different symbols denote different\ntransverse momentum intervals decreasing from top to bottom. One clearly observes\na strong correlation between freeze-out time and elliptic flow: particles that decouple\nearlier have a larger v2 value than those that freeze-out later. The lower pT particles\ntend to freeze-out later and their v2 continues to evolve late in the evolution (a similar\ncorrelation has been observed earlier in low energy collisions [34]) The decrease in the\n\n\f5\n\nAnisotropic flow at RHIC\n\n\u2212\u2212\n\n0.05\npT (GeV/c)\n\nv2\n\n0.04\n\n1.4-1.8\n0.8-1\n\n0.03\n\n0.6-0.8\n0.4-0.6\n\n0.02\n\n//models/feng25/v2_rqmd/plot4_22aug04//\n\nAu + Au at \u221asNN=200 GeV \u2192 \u03c0\nRQMD(v2.4)\n\n0.06\n\n0.2-0.4\n\n0.01\npT integrated\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nFreeze-out time (fm/c)\nFigure 3.

The\ndashed-line represents the pT integrated distribution.\n\nv2 towards later times is related to the reduction of the coordinate-space anisotropy\nwith time - i.e. the system has become more spherical than it was at earlier times. The\nv2 values of higher pT -pions saturate sooner and tend to reflect the earlier stage of the\ncollision more strongly. Thus, within the model dynamics, the final v2 is mostly driven\nby the early stages of the reaction; the v2 values at high pT are closer to the initial/early\nv2 values than the v2 values at lower pT .\n3. Particle Type Dependence\nHow much of the observed NCQ-scaling features can be reproduced by the hadronic\nmodels? In both dynamical approaches, finite (vacuum) cross sections are used to model\nthe strong interactions in the hadron-string cascade. Unlike the simplistic Cooper-Frye\nfreeze-out treatment in most hydrodynamic calculations, the transition from strongly\ninteracting matter to free-streaming is determined here by the interplay of the local\nparticle density and the energy dependent cross section of the individual hadrons. It is\nwell known that a proper treatment of the gradual freeze-out is crucial for the finally\nobserved hadron distributions. It was pointed out that the hydrodynamical results on\nflow depend strongly on the proper kinetic treatment of the freeze-out process and can\nnot be approximated by isotherms [35, 36, 37].\nHowever, the major shortcoming of the present hadron-string approach is the\nlack of the early partonic interactions which are important for the early dynamics in\nultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions [1, 2, 3, 7, 38]. In order to take care of both\npartonic and hadronic interactions in high-energy nuclear collisions, a combination\n\n\f6\n\nAnisotropic flow at RHIC\n\u2212\u2212\n\nRQMD (v2.4) Au + Au at \u221asNN=200 GeV\n(a) minimium bias\n\n0.08\n0.06\n\n(b) 40-80%\n\n\u039b\n\np\nK\n\u03c0\n\np\nK\n\u03c0\n//models/feng25/v2_rqmd/plot3_22aug04//\n\n0.04\n\nv2\n\n0.02\n0\n0.08\n\n(c) 20-40%\n\n(d) 0-20%\n\n0.06\n\np\nK\n\u03c0\n\np\nK\n\u03c0\n\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nTransverse momentum pT (GeV/c)\n\u221a\nFigure 4.

Fig. 4 shows the collision centrality dependence of the pT dependent v2 values for \u03c0, K, p, and \u039b. Both, the hydrodynamic behavior (in the low\npT region) and a hadron-type dependence (in the intermediate pT region) are clearly\npredicted in all centrality bins. This \"crossing and subsequent splitting\" between mesonand baryon elliptic flow as well as the breakdown of the hydrodynamical mass scaling\nat high transverse momenta was first predicted within the UrQMD model [7] and has\nlater been observed in the experimental data. It is important to note that the more\nrecent explanations of this effect (the suggested \"number-of-constituent-quark\" scaling)\nis not a unique feature of the \"quark recombination/coalescence\" assumption: hadronic\ninteractions alone have quantitatively (at the correct pT -values) predicted this hadron\ntype dependence.\nLet us explore the pT -dependence of the event anisotropy parameters in detail.\nFigure 5 shows the calculated unscaled and scaled v2 values of various hadrons versus\nthe unscaled and scaled transverse momenta, pT , of the various hadrons. On the left\nhand side (Figure 5(a)) one can see that at lower transverse momenta, pT \u2264 1.5 GeV/c,\nthe heavier hadrons exhibit smaller v2 values than the lighter hadrons: Hadron transport\ntheory predicts mass ordering. The \u039e and \u03a9 v2 values from the UrQMD calculations\nare also included. They are the lowest of all v2 values for pT \u2264 2 GeV/c.

Symbols represent results from the UrQMD (v2.2) model for various hadron\nspecies. At low pT /Nq \u2264 0.5 GeV/c, \u03c0 does not follow the scaling perhaps caused by\nthe resonance decay [14]. In higher pT region, K meson seems to fall off the scaling\ncurve due to the comparatively small hadronic cross sections in the model.\n\nordering is exactly what is observed in the experimental data [15] and is in accord with\nhydrodynamic calculations [45]. Hence, hadronic interactions, which do take place at\nlater stages of the collisions, also do contribute to the observed collective motion.\nAt higher pT values, this mass dependence gives way to the v2 (pT )-dependence\non the hadron type (i.e. meson or baryon). Here, it is interesting to note that the\n\u03a9-baryons seemingly acquire a significant amount of v2 in the model calculations. In\naddition, there is also clear, but small difference for kaons and pions in v2 values at\npT \u2265 1.5 GeV/c. This particle type dependence, rather than the otherwise dominating\nparticle mass dependence, is also observed in the data [15]. It is important to note that\nthe \u03c6 meson has a mass that is very close to the mass of the baryons p and \u039b, and,\nindeed, recent experimental results on the \u03c6's v2 values are similar to other mesons [46].\nHowever, in the hadronic transport model, about 2/3 of the \u03c6-mesons are formed via\nK-K\u0304-coalescence, which is not necessarily the dominant process in heavy ion collisions\n[47]. Therefore, the v2 values of \u03c6 meson are not shown in Figure 5. It should also be\nnoted that in the high pT region, pT \u2265 2.5 GeV/c, all v2 values start to decrease. This\nindicates that the system is deviating from an ideal hydrodynamic behavior. This trend\nis best seen in the right, \"scaled\", plot in Fig. 5. Such a drop has been observed in the\ndata.\nThe test of the NCQ scaling hypothesis is shown in Figure 5(b), which depicts the\nscaled hadron values, v2 /nq . The scaling factor is the number of constituent quarks\n(NCQ) in accord with the coalescence approach [23, 24, 25]. For mesons and baryons,\n\n\f8\n\nAnisotropic flow at RHIC\n\nnq = 2 and nq =3, respectively. The NCQ-scaling is clearly observed in both RQMD (not\nshown here) and UrQMD model calculations except for the pions. This surprising result\nand its implications for the frequently invoked recombination/coalescence hypothesis will\nbe discussed in the last section.\nHowever, one should note that there are experimentally distinguishable differences\n(when differential \u03a9 elliptic flow data with good statistics becomes available) between\n\"real\" NCQ scaling from coalescence and the approximate NCQ scaling due to the cross\nsection hierarchy discussed here. In the coalescence approach one expects identical\nelliptic flow of all baryons irrespective of their type. In contrast, the present AQM\nscaling picture, leads to an observable ordering of the elliptic flow at fixed pT according\nto the strangeness content. This can indeed be observed in Fig. 5, where an ordering\nof the elliptic flow values can be observed: v2 (N) > v2 (\u039b) > v2 (\u039e) > v2 (\u03a9).\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\nThe particle and energy density is highest at the center of the created fireball in\nrelativistic nuclear collisions - initially, there is an angular dependent matter density\ngradient. The repulsive interactions among the constituents will therefore push matter\nto move outwards. In this way, the collective flow develops in nucleus-nucleus collisions\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. We would like to stress that flow means matter- and energy flow. It\nis independent of the type of particles, either partons or hadrons, or different kinds of\nhadrons. Hence, by studying the collective motion of the produced hadrons one can, in\nprinciple, extract the information of early collision dynamics [4, 5, 51]. In general, one\nexpects that the final elliptic flow,\nv2 (pT ) \u221d\n\nZ Z\nt\n\n\u03a3\n\n~ \u03a3 (x, y)dt,\n\u03c3(\u03c1, pT ) \u2297 \u03c1\u03a3 (t, x, y, pT )dA\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a3 denotes the hyper-surface where hadrons are emitted, will depend on \u03c3, i.e.\nthe interaction cross section, which, in principle, depends on the particle type, cm angle\nand relative momenta. The specific particle density depends on the collision time t,\nlocation, and momentum. For short mean free paths, the transverse flow is intimately\nrelated to the pressure, which in turn depends on the density and temperature of the\nmatter under study [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Indeed, the frequent rescatterings among the\nhadrons can lead to hydrodynamic-like mass ordering in the low pT region.\nAt the higher transverse momenta, pT \u2265 1.5 GeV/c, the particles escape quickly\nfrom the system to low density, in effect leading to early freeze-out and lack of\ndevelopment of the hydrodynamics and the details of the interaction cross-sections are\nmost important. As the cross sections depend on the particle type, for mesons or baryons\nto first approximation given by the constituent quark model [23], we do expect roughly\na 2:3 scaling of the meson-to-baryon elliptic flow from transport calculations.\nThe hadronic models underpredicted the strength of v2 at RHIC, because early\npartonic interactions (except from quark coalescence during the string break-up) are\nnot included in the model. The early stage with highest density and smallest mean free\n\n\fAnisotropic flow at RHIC\n\n9\n\npaths is \"missing\". This shortcoming of the hadronic models clearly demonstrates the\nneed for the early, dense partonic interactions in heavy ion collisions at RHIC.\n5. Summary\nIn summary, the hadronic transport models UrQMD and RQMD have been employed to\nstudy the elliptic flow of hadrons in Au+Au collisions at the highest RHIC energy. We\nhave analyzed the v2 values as a function of collision centrality, transverse momenta and\ncollision time for various meson- and baryon species, including multi-strange baryons.\nBoth hadron-string transport models fail by 40% to exhaust the absolute value of\nv2 , probably due to the lack of (partonic) interactions in the initial, hot and dense\nstage. However, because of the hadronic re-interactions, the hadron mass hierarchy is\nqualitatively well reproduced in the low pT region. Rescattering is the key that leads\nto the quasi-ideal hydrodynamic appearance in v2 (pT ). Also in the intermediate pT\nregion, the hadron type dependence (number-of-constituent-quark scaling) is predicted\nby both hadronic transport models. Here, this dependence is due to the hadronic cross\nsections which do roughly scale with the number of constituent quarks, in accord with\nthe additive quark model. This finding challenges the recent interpretation of NCQ\nscaling as a unique deconfinement signature. Thus, further tests of the deconfinementplus-recombination hypothesis are necessary with high precision v2 measurements of\nresonance hadrons like K \u2217 , \u03c1, \u2206, \u039b\u2217 , and \u039e\u2217 .\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank C.
