Conditions under which gravity coupled to self interacting scalar field\ndetermines singularity formation are found and discussed. It is shown that, under a\nsuitable matching with an external space, the boundary, if collapses completely, may\ngive rise to a naked singularity. Issues related to the strength of the singularity are\ndiscussed.\n\n1. I NTRODUCTION\nThe gravitational collapse of scalar fields in classical General Relativity has been\nwidely studied in literature. Its role in understanding the machinery ruling singularities' causal structure \u2013 at least in spherical symmetry \u2013 was clear since 90's, when\nmodels of scalar field collapse exhibiting a naked singularity, and therefore violating\nthe so\u2013called Penrose's Cosmic Censorship Conjecture [18], were found numerically\nby Choptuik [1] and analytically by Christodoulou [2].\nIn these pioneering works the scalar field is massless and free, that means that\nthe Lagrangian function of the field does not contain any mass or potential terms.\nRecently, Hertog, Horowitz and Maeda [10] found a class of potentials where smooth\ninitial data evolve to give rise to a naked singularity, although energy conditions may\nbe violated. Moreover, in a recent paper, Goswami and Joshi [8] studied collapse of\nself interacting scalar field, under a homogeneity assumption, considering a class of\nmodels where divergence of energy density near the singularity is assumed to satisfy\na power\u2013law relation.\nAs is well known scalar field have not been observed although their fundamental\nrelevance in cosmology. Observational cosmology is indeed probably the unique field\nin which we can hope to obtain information on the scalar field potential, and several\nworks go in this direction, as e.g. [15] (and references therein) in which the analysis\nof transition from matter domination to dark energy domination is taken into account,\nalthough the expanding case is obviously considered there.\nIn the present paper, we consider homogeneous scalar fields collapsing models in\ngeneral, characterizing the class of potentials determining singularity formation. A\ncrucial role in determining the causal structure is played by the existence, or not, of\napparent horizon during the evolution. Since the singularity is (of course) synchronous, the behavior is quite different from what happens in many examples of matter\nmodels exhibiting a central naked singularity [5, 7]. Here, instead, it may be that the\nsingularity located at the boundary of the \"ball\" of scalar field can be naked. Therefore, the scalar field solution must be matched with a suitable external solution and\nbehavior of radial geodesic in the external solution must be studied accordingly.\nDate: April 2005 (revised version).\n1\n\n\fGRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OF HOMOGENEOUS SCALAR FIELDS\n\n2\n\nScalar field solution under homogeneity assumption is introduced in Section 2. In\nSection 3, necessary and sufficient conditions for singularity formation are stated, together with conditions which forbid apparent horizon formation during the evolution.\nIn the latter case, a matching with anisotropic generalization of de Sitter spacetime\n[6] is performed (Section 4), and naked singularity existence is proved \u2013 and its gravitational strength discussed \u2013 in Section 5. Reasons for our choice of exterior region\nare discussed in final Section 6, together with overall conclusions.\n2. T HE\n\nSOLUTION\n\nThe general scalar field spacetime is a spacetime (M, g\u03bc\u03bd ) satisfying Einstein field\nequations for the energy\u2013momentum tensor\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u03b1\u03b2\n(2.1)\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 \u2212\ng \u2202\u03b1 \u03c6\u2202\u03b2 \u03c6 + V (\u03c6) g\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\nwhere \u03c6 is a scalar function on M and V is the potential. We consider the case of a\nspherically symmetric spacetime where the gradient of \u03c6 is timelike, which allows us\nto choose a comoving gauge such that \u03c6 is a function of comoving time only, and the\nmetric and the energy\u2013momentum tensor can be respectively written in the form [12]\n(2.2)\n\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a2 (t) dr 2 + a2 (t)r 2 d\u03a92 ,\n\nand\n(2.3)\n\nT\u03bd\u03bc = diag(\u2212\u01eb, p, p, p)\n\nEquations (2.1)\u2013(2.2) imply that, in the above expression, the energy density \u01eb and the\nstress p can be written in terms of the field and the potential as\n(2.4)\n\n1\n\u01eb = \u03c6\u03072 + V (\u03c6),\n2\n\n1\np = \u03c6\u03072 \u2212 V (\u03c6),\n2\n\nwhere the dot denotes differentiation with respect to t.\nField equations reduce to\n(2.5)\n(2.6)\n\n8\u03c0 2\na \u01eb,\n\u02272 =\n3\nd \u0010 3 \u0011\na \u03c6\u0307 = \u2212a3 V \u2032 (\u03c6).\ndt\n\nin the unknown functions a(t) \u2265 0 and \u03c6(t). The potential V (\u03c6) has to be considered\nas a constitutive function that, analogously to what happen in the elastic\u2013solid matter case [13], establishes a relation between energy and stresses. In particular, (2.6)\nis Klein\u2013Gordon equation g \u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u03c6 = V \u2032 (\u03c6), obviously equivalent to the Bianchi\nidentity .\nWe will take initial data at an initial time, say t = 0:\n(2.7)\n\na(0) = a0 ,\n\n\u03c6(0) = \u03c60 ,\n\n\u03c6\u0307(0) = \u03c6\u03070 .\n\nThe field evolves collapsing until it possibly reaches the singular state at a = 0. We\nwill consequently consider cases where a is a monotonically decreasing function of t.\n\n\fGRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OF HOMOGENEOUS SCALAR FIELDS\n\n3\n\nThis fact implies that, for instance, the energy density \u01eb can be seen as a function of\na, and can be written as\n\u0012\n\u00132\n3 \u03c8(a)\n(2.8)\n\u01eb=\n,\n8\u03c0\na\nwhere \u03c8 \u2208 C \u221e ((0, a0 ), (0, +\u221e)). Note that, in principle, we don't make assumption\non the behavior of \u03c8(a) as a \u2192 0+ but, in order to study a physically meaningful\nsingularity, we will assume that\nlim+\n\n(2.9)\n\na\u21920\n\n\u03c8(a)\n= +\u221e.\na\n\nUsing (2.8), equation (2.5) takes the form\n\u0227 = \u2212\u03c8(a),\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere the sign choice is determined by the positive sign of \u03c8(a) and the fact that\nwe are considering a collapsing situation. Therefore, using initial condition (2.7), the\nfollowing proposition easily follows.\nProposition 2.1. The metric (2.2) is determined by the function\na(t) = F \u22121 (F (a0 ) \u2212 t),\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere F = F (a) is a primitive function of 1/\u03c8(a).\nMoreover, such a choice of \u03c8 also determines both the scalar function \u03c6 and the\npotential V as functions of a. Indeed, with the positions\n\u0001 1\nR\n1 \u2212 g \u03b1\u03b2 \u2202\u03b1 R \u2202\u03b2 R = r 3 a(t)\u02272 (t),\n2\n2\nusing (2.4), (2.10), it is easy to see that Klein\u2013Gordon equation (2.6) is completely\nequivalent to\n(2.12)\n\n(2.13)\n\nR := a(t)r,\n\nm :=\n\n\u1e41 = \u22124\u03c0 p R2 \u1e58,\n\nand, in view of the above equation and (2.10) again, we can write the stress p as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c8 \u2032 (a)\n\u03c8 2 (a)\n.\n1 + 2a\n(2.14)\np=\u2212\n8\u03c0a2\n\u03c8(a)\nUsing (2.4), (2.10), one finally finds\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u03c8 \u2032 (a)\n1\nd\u03c6\n,\n1\u2212a\n=\n(2.15)\nda\n4\u03c0a2\n\u03c8(a)\n(2.16)\n\n\u03c8 2 (a)\nV =\n4\u03c0a2\n\n\u0012\n\n1 \u03c8 \u2032 (a)\n1+ a\n2 \u03c8(a)\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nTherefore, chosen an energy profile through the function \u03c8(a), the solution is completely expressed in function of a and, consequently, of t. In case the function \u03c6(a) is\ninvertible, one can say more. Indeed, the following proposition holds.\n\n\fGRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OF HOMOGENEOUS SCALAR FIELDS\n\n4\n\n\u2032\n\n(a)\na < 1 in (0, a0 ), the spacetime given by (2.11) solves Einstein\nProposition 2.2. If \u03c8\u03c8(a)\nfield equations, with the potential V (\u03c6) = V (a(\u03c6)), where V (a) is given by (2.16),\nand a(\u03c6) is the inverse function of\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ a0 s\n1\n\u03c8 \u2032 (\u03b8)\n(2.17)\n\u03c6(a) = \u03c60 +\nd\u03b8.\n1\u2212\u03b8\n4\u03c0\u03b82\n\u03c8(\u03b8)\na\n\nRemark 2.3. Since\n2\n\n2\n\n\u01eb + p = \u03c6\u0307 = \u0227\n\u2032\n\n\u0012\n\nd\u03c6\nda\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(a)\nthe condition \u03c8\u03c8(a)\na < 1 in (0, a0 ) can be reinterpreted by saying that the weak energy\ncondition inequality must be strictly satisfied, that is \u01eb + p > 0. Of course, one can\ninvert the function \u03c6(a) (2.17) under more general conditions also, for instance if \u01eb+p\nvanishes for some isolate values of a, but in this case problems of regularity may arise.\n\n3. S INGULARITY\n\nFORMATION\n\nProperties of \u03c8(a) will be used to study singularity formation and behavior for the\nsolutions above. The following theorem holds.\nTheorem 3.1. The spacetime becomes singular in a finite amount of comoving time if\nand only if the function 1/\u03c8(a) is integrable on (0, a0 ). The time of collapse is given\nby\nZ a0\n1\nda.\n(3.1)\nts =\n\u03c8(a)\n0\nProof. If 1/\u03c8(a) is integrable in (0, a0 ), the primitive F (a) can be continuously extended to a = 0. In this case ts = F (a0 ) \u2212 F (0), and using (2.11) it follows that\na(ts ) = 0. Viceversa, if a(t) = 0 for some ts \u2208 (0, +\u221e), then by continuity\nlimt\u2192ts a(t) = 0. Equation (2.11) again implies that lima\u21920+ F (a) = F (a0 ) \u2212 ts ,\nand the primitive can be extended up to a = 0.\n\u0003\nWe will suppose hereafter that we are in the hypothesis of Theorem 3.1, so that\nsingularity forms in a finite amount of comoving time. In order to study singularity\nbehavior, we fix ts as in (3.1) and consider the apparent horizon curve th (r) implicitly\ndefined by the equation R(r, th (r)) = 2m(r, th (r)). It is the boundary of the trapped\nregion\nT = {(r, t) : R(r, t) \u2264 2m(r, t)}.\nThe following result holds.\n\nProposition 3.2. If \u03c8(a) is bounded in (0, a0 ), there exists rb > 0 such that, for any\nshell of matter r \u2264 rb , no apparent horizon forms during the evolution.\nProof. Using (2.12), the inequality R > 2m means that\n(3.2)\n\n\u03c8(a)r < 1.\n\nThen, it suffices to choose rb < (sup(0,a0 ) \u03c8(a))\u22121 , and, if r \u2264 rb and t < ts , it will\nbe (t, r) 6\u2208 T .\n\u0003\n\n\fGRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OF HOMOGENEOUS SCALAR FIELDS\n\n5\n\nRemark 3.3. The quantity rb will play the role of the boundary of scalar field collapsing sphere. Note that the absence of horizon does not mean, in principle, that\nthe singularity is naked. Indeed, if a future pointing null geodesic arising from the\nsingularity exists, it must satisfy the ODE\ndt\n(3.3)\n= a(t),\ndr\nand then it must be an increasing function of r. This cannot happen for r \u2208 [0, rb),\nbecause the singularity is synchronous. But it could be the case for a null geodesic to\narise from (rb , ts ) and go into the external space. This situation can be studied only\nafter we join, at the shell rb , the solutions found in Section 2 with an exterior solution.\nThis will be done in Section 4.\nRemark 3.4. Note that one can conceive cases of such no trapped surface formation\nwhen pressures (2.14) do not diverge and do not remain negative in the approach\nto the\n\u221a\n5\nsingularity, even when w.e.c. is satisfied. Take, for instance, \u03c8(a) = a(sin log a +\n5\n). Anyway, if pressures diverge, potential also (positively) does.\n3\nWe now consider the case where \u03c8 is unbounded, positively diverging at the singularity.\nProposition 3.5. If lima\u21920+ \u03c8(a) = +\u221e, for any r > 0 such that the initial data\nare taken outside the trapped region T , the shell labelled r becomes trapped strictly\nbefore it becomes singular, and so a black hole forms.\nProof. Fix any r > 0. If (r, 0) 6\u2208 T , then \u03c8(a0 ) < 1r . But \u03c8(a) \u2192 +\u221e as a \u2192 0, and\ntherefore by continuity there must exists a time th (r) < ts such that \u03c8(a(th (r))) =\n1/r. Then, the apparent horizon lies below the singularity curve t = ts , which is\ntherefore covered for any r > 0.\nSimilar arguments to those made in Remark 3.3 show that, even if limr\u21920+ th (r) =\nts , there cannot exist future pointing null geodesic below the horizon arising from the\ncentre, and then t = ts is covered at each shell.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.6. Note that hypothesis of Proposition 3.5 does not cover all cases of unbounded \u03c8(a), which indeed may not have limit as a \u2192 0+ .\nExample 3.7. Consider the case of \u03c8 ruled by the power\u2013law relation [8]\nr\n8\u03c0 \u03b2\n\u03c8(a) =\na , \u03b2 \u2208 R,\n3\nwhere \u03b2 < 1 by compatibility with (2.9). Hypotheses of Theorem 3.1 are always\nverified with this choice of \u03c8, therefore the model collapses in a finite amount of\ncomoving time. Using the above equations one finds\n1\n! 1\u2212\u03b2\nr\n8\u03c0\na(t) = a1\u2212\u03b2\n\u2212\n,\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2)t\n0\n3\nr\n1\u2212\u03b2\na0\n\u03c6(a) = \u03c60 +\nlog ,\n4\u03c0\na\n\u221a\nV (\u03c6) = V0 e 16\u03c0(1\u2212\u03b2)(\u03c6\u2212\u03c60 ) .\n\n\fGRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OF HOMOGENEOUS SCALAR FIELDS\n\n6\n\nIf \u03b2 is not negative we are in the case of Proposition 3.2 and no apparent horizon\nforms if one takes rb sufficiently small. On the other side, \u03b2 negative implies apparent\nhorizon existence (Proposition 3.5), and\nth (r) = ts \u2212 \u03b3r\n\n\u03b2\u22121\n\u03b2\n\n,\n\nwhere \u03b3 > 0 depends on \u03b2. Note that the centre gets trapped at singular comoving\ntime ts . The particular case \u03b2 = \u2212 21 corresponds \u2013 as easily inferred using (2.4) \u2013\nto vanishing stresses, and in fact the solution is formally equivalent to the case of\nhomogeneous dust cloud collapse (Oppenheimer\u2013Snyder model [16]).\n4. T HE\n\nEXTERIOR REGION\n\nOur aim is to join the scalar field spacetime with an exterior solution at r = rb ,\nand study singularity arising from r = rb , t = ts . The matching will be performed\nalong a hypersurface \u03a3 using Israel\u2013Darmois junction conditions [4, 11], that requires\ncontinuity across \u03a3 of the first and the second fundamental forms induced on \u03a3 by\nthe two spacetimes. For this reason, one cannot expect to perform the junction with\nSchwarzschild line element, since radial stresses of the scalar field ball do not vanish in principle (see (2.14)). Therefore, as exterior solution, we will consider the\nanisotropic generalization of de Sitter spacetime \u2013 see [6] and references therein \u2013\nthat we here briefly review.\nConsider a spherically symmetric spacetime such that the metric tensor and the\nenergy\u2013momentum tensor respectively reads\n(4.1)\n(4.2)\n\nds2 = \u2212e2\u03bd dt2 + e2\u03bb dr 2 + Y 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ),\nT\u03c1\u03bc = diag (\u2212\u01eb(r, t), pr (r, t), pt (r, t), pt (r, t)) .\n\nAs well known, stresses are isotropic in case of de Sitter solution pr = pt = p, where\n\u01eb + p = 0. One may try to look for generalizations of this case, braking the isotropy\nconditions, that is supposing pr 6= pt , but still assuming\n(4.3)\n\n\u01eb + pr = 0.\n\nThis amounts to weaken the degeneracy hypothesis on the tensor T\u03bd\u03bc of de Sitter\nsolution, retaining two different degenerate subspaces. Misner\u2013Sharp mass reads\ni\nY h\n\u2032 \u2212\u03bb 2\n\u2212\u03bd 2\n(4.4)\nm=\n1 \u2212 (Y e ) + (\u1e8e e ) ,\n2\n(in this Section, dot and prime will denote differentiation w.r.t t and r, respectively).\nUsing Einstein equations together with assumption (4.3)Rone shows that both \u01eb and m\nY\ncan be seen as functions of Y . In particular m(Y ) = 4\u03c0 0 \u01eb(\u03c3)\u03c3 2 d\u03c3 + m0 . With the\nadditional ansatz that\n(Y \u2032 e\u2212\u03bb ), (\u1e8e e\u2212\u03bd ),\nare functions of the variable Y only, that amounts to require a higher degree of symmetry of the solution \u2013 a G4 group of motion \u2013 it can be seen that a suitable coordinate\nchange exists, that brings the solution in the form\n(4.5)\n\nds2 = \u2212\u03c7(Y ) dT 2 + \u03c7(Y )\u22121 dY 2 + Y 2 d\u03a92 ,\n\n\u03c7(Y ) = 1 \u2212\n\n2M(Y )\n,\nY\n\n\fGRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OF HOMOGENEOUS SCALAR FIELDS\n\n7\n\nthereby obtaining a family of solution as the mass M(Y ) varies. This function M(Y )\nis arbitrary but, to satisfy weak energy conditions, it must obey to the following law\n2\n(4.6)\nM \u2032 (Y ) \u2265 0,\nM \u2032\u2032 (Y ) \u2212 M \u2032 (Y ) \u2264 0.\nY\nThe family outlined here contains, for instance, Minkowski, Schwarzschild, Reissner\u2013\nNordstr\u00f6m and de Sitter spacetimes as particular cases, corresponding to choosing\nthe function M(Y ) respectively equal to 0, to m0 (constant), to m0 + e20 /Y (m0 , e0\nconstant) and to 34 \u01eb0 \u03c0Y 3 . Computation of Kretschmann scalar implies that the only\nsingularity may arise at Y = 0 \u2013 for instance, it suffices that m(Y ) = Y \u03b1 + o(Y \u03b1 ) for\nY \u2192 0, with 0 < \u03b1 < 3.\n4.1. Matching conditions. Let us now consider a spherical symmetric source\n(4.7)\n\nds2 = \u2212e2\u03bd dt2 + e2\u03bb dr 2 + R2 (r, t)(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ),\n\nOur aim is to show that, at a spherical junction hypersurface r = rb , no conditions\nother than continuity of the mass function are required to perform the matching. Indeed, the following proposition holds.\nProposition 4.1. A general spherical line element (4.7) can be joined with the spacetime (4.5) at a hypersurface \u03a3 := {(t, r = rb , \u03b8, \u03c6)}. The matching conditions at \u03a3\nread\ndT\nR\u2032 (rb , t)\n(4.8)\nY (t) = R(rb , t),\n(t) =\n,\ndt\n\u03c7(m(rb , t))e(\u03bb\u2212\u03bd)(rb ,t)\nwhere m(r, t) is the Misner\u2013Sharp mass function of the metric (4.7).\nProof. Let us parameterize \u03a3 with coordinates (\u03c4, \u03b8, \u03c6). The injection of \u03a3 into the\ninternal space equipped with metric (4.7) simply reads (\u03c4, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u0592\u2192 (\u03c4, rb , \u03b8, \u03c6). Consequently, the fundamental forms induced by the metric on \u03a3 can be computed as\n(4.9)\n(4.10)\n\nI\u03a3int = \u2212e2\u03bd d\u03c4 2 + R2 d\u03a92 ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\nII\u03a3int = \u2212e\u03bb e2(\u03bd\u2212\u03bb) \u03bd \u2032 d\u03c4 2 \u2212 e\u22122\u03bb R\u2032 R d\u03a92 .\n\nwhere we suppose the metric terms calculated in (rb , t).\nWe perform the same operation with the external metric (4.5). The injection reads\nin coordinates (\u03c4, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u0592\u2192 (T (\u03c4 ), Y (\u03c4 ), \u03b8, \u03c6), where T (\u03c4 ), Y (\u03c4 ) are unknown functions. First fundamental form in this case is\n!\n2\n\u1e8e\n(4.11)\nI\u03a3ext = \u2212\u03c7(Y )\u1e6a 2 +\nd\u03c4 2 + Y 2 d\u03a92 ,\n\u03c7(Y )\nwhere, with a slight abuse of notation, we denote derivatives of T and Y by \u1e6a and \u1e8e .\nContinuity of the first fundamental form at \u03a3 implies\n(4.12)\n\nY (\u03c4 ) = R(\u03c4, rb ),\n\nwhich is the first equation in (4.8), and\n(4.13)\n\n\u2212 \u03c7(Y )\u1e6a 2 +\n\n\u1e8e 2\n= \u2212e2\u03bd .\n\u03c7(Y )\n\n\fGRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OF HOMOGENEOUS SCALAR FIELDS\n\n8\n\nThe second fundamental form reads (M,Y is the derivative of M(Y ))\n( \"\n#\n\u0012\n\u0013\nM\nM\n\u1e8e\n\u1e6a\n,Y\n(4.14) II\u03a3ext = e\u2212\u03bd \u1e8e T\u0308 + 2\nd\u03c4 2 \u2212\n\u2212\nY2\nY\n\u03c7(Y )\n\u0015\u001b\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0012\nM,Y\nM\n2\u03bd\n2\n2\n,\ne d\u03c4 \u2212 Y \u03c7(Y ) d\u03a9\n\u2212\n\u2212\u1e6a \u0178 +\nR2\nY\nwhere we have used (4.13). Comparison of the angular terms in the two second fundamental forms immediately yields\n\u1e6a =\n\n(4.15)\n\nR\u2032\n\u03c7e(\u03bb\u2212\u03bd)\n\ni.e. the second condition in (4.8). Finally, let us show that there are no other conditions\nto be imposed. First, substituting (4.8) in (4.13) we get the identity\n(4.16)\n\n\u03c7(R) = (R\u2032 e\u2212\u03bb )2 \u2212 (\u1e58e\u2212\u03bd )2 ,\n\nthat only says that the mass function must be continuous across \u03a3, that is m(rb , t) =\nM(Y (t)). Therefore, we are only left with the proof that coefficients of d\u03c4 2 in the\ntwo second fundamental forms coincide, that is we have to prove\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nM\n2 2\nM,Y\n\u2212\u03bd\n2\u03bd\n(4.17)\ne\nT\u0308 \u1e8e \u2212 \u1e6a \u0178\n\u1e8e \u1e6a \u2212 e \u1e6a\n+ e2\u03bd\u2212\u03bb \u03bd \u2032 = 0\n\u2212\nY2\nY\n\u03c7\nBut this equation can be easily shown to hold identically by calculating the quantities\nT\u0308 from (4.15) and \u0178 from (4.16), and using Einstein equation \u1e58\u2032 \u2212\u03bb\u0307R\u2032 \u2212\u03bd \u2032 \u1e58 = 0. \u0003\nRemark 4.2. The anisotropic generalizations of de Sitter spacetime (4.5) are formally\na subclass of the so\u2013called generalized Vaidya solutions [9, 21], given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2M(V, Y )\n2\ndV 2 \u2212 2 dY dV + Y 2 d\u03a92 .\n(4.18)\nds = \u2212 1 \u2212\nY\n\nIndeed, in case M depends only on Y , i.e. M,V = 0, the coordinate transformation\n1\ndV = dT \u2212 \u03c7(Y\ndY brings (4.5) into (4.18).\n)\nOf course, a similar result to Proposition 4.1 can be proved for this wider class of\nsolutions. But, in this case, there is an additional condition on the mass function, that\nmust satisfy the requirement (see also [8, equation (39)])\nM,V = 0\n\n(4.19)\n\non \u03a3,\n\nto perform the matching with the general spherical symmetric line element (4.7).\n5. NAKED\n\nSINGULARITIES EXISTENCE\n\nWe now confine ourselves to the case when \u03c8(a) is a bounded function of a. The\nsingularity that develops is therefore massless, as one can easily infer from (2.12)\nusing (2.10). Moreover, in view of Proposition 3.2, the singular curve t = ts does not\nget trapped if one take rb sufficiently small.\nIn view of the results of Section 4 above, we consider the spacetime where the\ninterior scalar field is matched with an exterior anisotropic generalization of de Sitter\nspacetime (4.5) at the shell \u03a3 labeled rb . Let us recall that the mass (2.12) m is equal,\n\n\fGRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OF HOMOGENEOUS SCALAR FIELDS\n\n9\n\nusing (2.10), to 21 r 3 a\u03c8 2 (a) = 12 r 2 R\u03c8 2 ( Rr ), and therefore a necessary condition must\nbe\n1\n\u2200Y \u2208 [0, a20 rb2 ].\n(5.1)\nM(Y ) = rb2 Y \u03c8 2 ( rYb ),\n2\nIn principle, the matching condition fixes the mass function for the external region\nfor the portion of junction surface corresponding to the observed scalar field collapsing ball, that is for t running from 0 to the time of collapse ts . For bigger values of Y\n(Y > a20 rb2 ), the mass is determined by the form of the metric for t < 0.\nAs we already know, the exterior solution may possess a singularity at Y = 0,\ndepending on the mass profile. From the equation of state (4.3), energy diverges\nat Y = 0 if pr does, and since, with the above choice of mass, radial pressure is\ncontinuous across junction surface, then Y = 0 is a singularity if\nlim p(a) = \u2212\u221e,\n\n(5.2)\n\na\u21920+\n\nwhere p(a) is the quantity, depending on \u03c8(a), given by (2.14).\nRemark 5.1. Weak energy condition (4.6) is equivalent, with the above choice of\nM(Y ), to the following two conditions on the function \u03c8:\n\u0001\n(5.3)\n\u03c8(a) + 2a\u03c8 \u2032 (a) \u2265 0, \u03c8 2 (a) \u2212 a2 \u03c8 \u20322 (a) + \u03c8(a)\u03c8 \u2032\u2032 (a) \u2265 0.\n\nWe observe by the way that the first of these inequalities implies that potential (2.16)\ndiverges. Conditions (5.3) are satisfied by power\u2013law models of Example 3.7, when\n\u03c8 is bounded, i.e. for non-negative \u03b2.\nWe prove the following theorem.\n\nTheorem 5.2. Suppose that \u03c8(a) is bounded and satisfies (5.2), and let rb such that\n1 \u2212 \u03c8 2 (a(t))r 2 is bounded away from 0 uniformly on (0, rb ) \u00d7 (0, ts ). Then, the\nboundary \u03a3 = {r = rb } of the scalar field collapses to a naked singularity.\nProof. Equations (4.8) becomes, using (2.10), (2.12) also,\ndT\nrb\n(5.4)\nY (t) = a(t)rb ,\n(t) = \u2212\n.\n2 2\ndt\n1 \u2212 rb \u03c8 (a(t))\n\nLet rb such that 1 \u2212 \u03c8 2 (a(t))r 2 is bounded away from 0. Such a choice is, of course,\nalways made possible because \u03c8(a) is bounded. Then 1\u2212r2 \u03c8r2b (a(t)) is bounded in (0, a0 )\nb\nand we can integrate the ODE in (5.4) to obtain\nlim T (t) = T0 \u2208 (0, +\u221e).\n\nt\u2192ts\n\nThen the anisotropic generalization of de Sitter spacetime solution can be extended\nup to T = T0 , Y = 0. But in a neighborhood of this point, \u03c7 is bounded away from\nzero because junction conditions (5.4) imply continuity of the mass function, and by\nb)\nhypothesis, 1 \u2212 2m(t,r\nis bounded away from zero as the singularity is approached.\nY (t,rb )\nThen the ODE\n1\ndT\n=\n(5.5)\ndY\n\u03c7(Y )\ncan be solved in a right neighborhood of Y = 0, and there exists a radial null geodesic\nstarting from the singularity, which is therefore naked.\n\u0003\n\n\fGRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OF HOMOGENEOUS SCALAR FIELDS\n\n10\n\nRemark 5.3. The above theorem applies to cases described in Example 3.7, with \u03b2 \u2265\n= \u03c8(a(t))2 rb2\n0. We stress the fact that, in the approach to the singularity t = ts , 2m\nR\ndoes not need to vanish, but may also tend to a constant nonzero value, or may even\nnot possess a limit value. Consider, for instance, Example 3.7 with \u03b2 = 0. We know\nis a positive\nthat that no horizon forms if rb is sufficiently small, but now 1 \u2212 2m\nR\nconstant on \u03a3.\n5.1. Strength of the singularity. Since we have found examples of spacetimes exhibiting a naked singularity, it may be of interest to determine its strength. The first\ndefinition of strong curvature singularity was suggested by Tipler [19] and studied\ne.g. in [3, 20]. Modifications to this definition have been also suggested by Nolan\n[14] and Ori [17] to take into account pathological situations where, although volume forms along geodesics preserve, Jacobi fields have opposite irregular behavior\n\u2013 i.e. one diverges and another one vanishes in the approach to the singularity. For\nmost of our purposes, anyway, it will suffice to look at the behavior of the quantity\n\u03b1\nk 2 \u03a8 = k 2 R\u03b1\u03b2 K \u03b1 K \u03b2 along causal geodesics, where R\u03b1\u03b2 is Ricci tensor, K \u03b1 = dx\nis\ndk\nthe tangent vector of the geodesic with parameter k. If this quantity remains bounded\naway from zero in the approach to the singularity, this one may be considered as\nphysically meaningful.\nLet us first consider the metric (2.2). If K \u03b1 is a radial null geodesic, it can be\ncomputed, using (2.10), that\n\n2\n\nk \u03a8=2\n\n\u0012\n\nk da\na dk\n\n\u00132 \u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u03c8 \u2032 (a)a\n1\u2212\n.\n\u03c8(a)\n\nIf the limit da\nexists as k \u2192 0, the quantity in round brackets tends to a finite value,\ndk\nwhile the quantity in square brackets remains bounded away from zero if \u01eb + p > 0\n(see (5.1)), and then the radial null geodesic terminates in a strong singularity.\nOf course, in our model the interior scalar field region is matched with an exterior\nwhere metric tensor is given by (4.5), and so strength of the central singularity of (4.5)\nmust be determined to see whether strong singularity persists.\n\u0010\n\na \u03c8\u2032 (a)\n\u03c8(a)\n\na \u03c8\u2032\u2032 (a)\n\u03c8\u2032 (a)\n\n\u0011\n\nProposition 5.4. If, \u2200a \u2208 (0, a0 ), the quantity\n+\n+ 2 is well defined\nand bounded away from zero, then there exists causal geodesics terminating into the\nnaked singularity and satisfying the limit strong curvature condition lim inf k\u21920 |k 2 \u03a8| >\n0.\nProof. Let us evaluate the strength of the Y = 0 singularity in this case, recalling\nthat the mass M(Y ) is given by (5.1). Actually, it can now be checked that \u03a8 vanishes along null geodesics, and so we will consider the situation for timelike radial\ngeodesics. Their equations integrate to give (see also (5.4))\ndT\n\u03be\n=\n,\ndk\n\u03c7(Y (k))\n\np\ndY\n= \u03be 2 \u2212 \u03b6 2\u03c7(Y (k)),\ndk\n\n\fGRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OF HOMOGENEOUS SCALAR FIELDS\n\n11\n\n(\u03be and \u03b6 6= 0 are integration constants) that is, they are regular at Y = 0.

The above theorem applies to the power\u2013law cases discussed in Example 3.7, with \u03b2 strictly positive, and more generally for functions \u03c8 not\u2013decreasing\nbut strictly concave in (0, a0 ).\nThe case \u03b2 = 0 (see also Remark 5.3), where |k 2 \u03a8| is seen to go to zero, may be\ntreated using ideas from [14], and results in a weak singularity.\n6. D ISCUSSION\n\nAND CONCLUSIONS\n\nAs we have seen, the formation of singularities the gravitational collapse of homogeneous scalar fields with potential is completely ruled by a condition of integrability\nof a function related to the energy density of the model. If this function is bounded,\napparent horizon formation is avoided during the evolution, and therefore the singularity is massless, which, as is well known, is actually a feature of any spherically\nsymmetric naked singularity.\nThe boundary develops a naked singularity when the exterior solution is given by\nanisotropic de Sitter generalization (4.5), and the singularity turns out to satisfy a\nstrong curvature condition for a class of examples that also includes power\u2013law cases\nstudied in [8].\nLet us briefly comment on the choice of the exterior region. In the examples discussed in [8], the matching is performed with a wider class, that is the generalization\nof Vaidya spacetime. One may wonder whether the strong curvature condition is satisfied also along null geodesics with this more general choice of mass profile. Actually,\nin this case k 2 \u03a8 is not identically zero \u2013 as it happens in the case we studied \u2013 but it\ncan be checked that again it vanishes in the limit k \u2192 0+ , due to matching condition\n(4.19).\nIt must therefore be observed that, if the exterior region is given by (4.5) or even the\nmore general metric (4.18), the limit strong curvature condition proved in Proposition\n5.4 does not hold for any radial geodesic, but only for timelike geodesic satisfying\ndY\n\u2192 0 in the approach to the singularity. Such a case is possible due to the fact that\ndk\nno apparent horizon form in the interior region, and \u03c7 is bounded away from zero near\nthe singularity. Although one may try and see what happens with other exterior metrics, this fact seems to be a distinctive feature of the homogeneous scalar field model\nunder exam, which possess a synchronous singularity, and therefore is qualitatively\ndifferent from other Cosmic Censorship counterexamples known in literature [5, 7].\nIn conclusion, breaking the homogeneity assumption of scalar field models with\npotential seems an unavoidable step to retain strong curvature condition along any\ncausal geodesic terminating into the naked singularity.\n\n\fGRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OF HOMOGENEOUS SCALAR FIELDS\n\n12\n\nR EFERENCES\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n\nM.
