Paper [Fo] classified the finite dimensional comodules over HR .\nIt is well-known that Hopf algebra HR of rooted trees is the algebra of polynomials\nover Q, whose indeterminate elements are equivalent classes of rooted trees. That is,\nHR = Q[RT ] as algebras, where RT is the set of equivalent classes of all rooted trees (see\nsection 1).\nTherefore, it is necessary to find a formula to compute the number of equivalent\nclasses of rooted trees with weight n. Fortunately, we complete this in this paper. The\nHopf algebra of rooted trees and the enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of rooted trees\nare two important examples of Hopf algebras. We give their representation by means\nof path algebras. In particular, primitive elements of HR are extraordinary. In this\npaper we use this special structure to show that the analogue of Andruskiewitsch and\nSchneider's Conjecture [AS2, Conjecture 1.4] is not true. That is, there is an infinite\n\n1\n\n\fdimensional pointed Hopf algebra, which is not generated by its coradical and its skewprimitive elements. That is, this conjecture is not true when the condition which H\nis finite dimensional is omitted. Paper [ZGZ] pointed out that we can systematically\nstructure the solutions of Yang-Baxter equations by means of local quasitriangular Hopf\nalgebras. In this paper we structure the graded Drinfeld double of Hopf algebra of rooted\ntrees and show that it is a local quasitriangular Hopf algebra.\n\nPreliminaries\nWe will use notations of [CK] and [Fo]. We call rooted tree t a connected and simplyconnected finite set of oriented edges and vertices such that there is one distinguished\nvertex with no incoming edge; this vertex is called the root of t. The weight of t is\nthe number of its vertices. The fertility of a vertex v of a tree t is the number of edges\noutgoing from v. A ladder is a rooted tree such that every vertex has fertility less than\nor equal to 1. There is a unique ladder of weight i; we denote it by li .\nLet Z, Z+ and N denote the sets of all integers, all positive integers and all nonnegative integers, respectively. k = Q denotes rational number field. Let RT denote the\nset of equivalent classes of all rooted trees (see section 1). HR and L1 denote the Hopf\nalgebra and Lie algebra in [CK] and [Fo, Section 2], called the Hopf algebra of rooted tree\nand the Lie algebra of rooted tree, respectively. Hladd denotes the Hopf subalgebra of HR\ngenerated by all ladders li\u2032 s.\nWe define the algebra HR as the algebra of polynomials over Q in RT . The monomials\nof HR will be called f orests. It is often useful to think of the unit 1 of HR as an empty\nforest.\nLet M, N be two forests of HR . We define:\n(\nP\n1\nforests obtained by appending M to every node of N if N 6= 1\nweight(N )\nM\u22a4N =\n0\nif N = 1.\nWe can extend .\u22a4. to a bilinear map from HR \u00d7 HR into HR .\n\n1\n\nThe number of rooted trees\n\nIn this section we give a formula to compute the number of equivalent classes of rooted\ntrees with weight n.\nA sub-tree u of rooted tree t is said to be of the height r if the distant from root of\nt to root of u is r, i.e. there exist exactly r arrows from root of t to root of u. Assume\nthat u and u\u2032 are two sub-trees of rooted tree t with the same height. If we change\n2\n\n\fthe position of u and u\u2032 in t, we get a new rooted tree t\u2032 , said that t\u2032 is obtained by a\nelementary transformation from t. Two rooted trees t and t\u2032 are called equivalent if t\u2032\ncan be obtained by finite elementary transformations from t, written as t \u223c t\u2032 . Note that\nt \u223c t for any rooted tree t since we can choice u = u\u2032 . For example,\nt\nt\n\nt\n\nt\nt\nt\nt\n\u2745\n\u2745t\n\nt\n\n\u223c\n\nt\nt\n\nt\nt\nt\nt\n\u2745\n\u2745t\n\nt\nt t\n\u2745\n\u2745t\n\n,\n\nt\n\n\u223c\n\nt\nt t\n\u2745\n\u2745t\n\nt\n\nFigure 1: the first and second rooted trees are equivalent; the third and fourth rooted trees\nare equivalent.\nObviously, \" \u223c \" is an equivalent relation in all rooted trees. Let RT be the set of\nequivalent classes of all rooted trees and RTn be the set of equivalent classes of all rooted\ntrees with weight n. Define a(n) := card RTn , i.e. the number of elements in RTn .\nTheorem 1.1.\na(n + 1) =\n\nX\n\n\u03bb1\n\u03bbn\nCa(1)+\u03bb\nC \u03bb2\n* * * Ca(n)+\u03bb\n.\nn \u22121\n1 \u22121 a(2)+\u03bb2 \u22121\n\n(1)\n\n1\u03bb1 +2\u03bb2 +***+n\u03bbn =n\n\nProof. Let t be a rooted tree with weight n + 1. Assume that there exists \u03bbi subtrees\nof t with height 1 and weight i for i = 1, 2, * * * , n. Then 1\u03bb1 + 2\u03bb2 + * * * + n\u03bbn = n and\nwe have the formula (1) by combination theory. \u2737\nRemark: The indeterminate elements of algebra HR of polynomials are the equivalent\nclasses of rooted trees, instead of rooted trees. Otherwise, B+ in [CK, map (45)] is not a\nmap.\n\n2\n\nThe representation of the Hopf algebra and the Lie\nalgebra of rooted trees\n\nIn this section we give the representation of the Hopf algebra and the Lie algebra of rooted\ntrees.\nLet us recall the representation of a quiver. Let G = {e} be a trivial group and Q the\nquiver over G with arrow set Q1 . Obviously, Q is a Hopf quiver. Let kQa denote the path\nalgebra of quiver Q. It is clear that the free algebra generated by Q1 is isomorphic to the\npath algebra kQa as algebras. Let V be a vector space and f = {ft }t\u2208Q1 with ft \u2208 Endk V\nfor any t \u2208 Q1 . We define a map \u03b1f from kQa \u2297 V to V as follows:\n\u03b1f (t1 t2 * * * tn \u2297 v) = t1 t2 * * * tn * v := ft1 ft2 * * * ftn (v)\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\ffor any v \u2208 V, t1 , t2 , * * * , tn \u2208 Q1 . It is clear that (V, \u03b1f ) is a kQa -module, called a quiver\nmodule.\nAssume that \u03c1 is a subset of kQa and (\u03c1) denotes the ideal generated by \u03c1. Let (V, \u03b1f )\nbe a quiver module. For any element \u03c3 \u2208 kQa , we write f\u03c3 : V \u2192 V by sending x to \u03c3 * x\nfor any x \u2208 V . Obviously, if (V, \u03b1f ) is a quiver module with f\u03c3 = 0 for any \u03c3 \u2208 \u03c1, then\n(V, \u03b1f ) is a kQa /(\u03c1) -module with \u0101 * m = a * m for any a \u2208 kQa , m \u2208 M. This is called a\nfactor quiver module. Note every quiver module over kQa can be view as a factor quiver\nmodule over kQa /(\u03c1) when \u03c1 is empty.\nAssume that (V, \u03b1f ) and (V \u2032 , \u03b1f \u2032 ) are two factor quiver modules. If h : (V, \u03b1f ) \u2192\n(V \u2032 , \u03b1f \u2032 ) a homomorphism of kQa /(\u03c1)-modules, then hft = ft\u2032 h for any t \u2208 Q1 . Conversely,\nif h is a k-linear map from V to V \u2032 with hft = ft\u2032 h for any t \u2208 Q1 , then h is homomorphism\nof kQa /(\u03c1)-modules.\nLemma 2.1. (see [ZZ, Theorem 2.9] or [ARS]) (i) (V, \u03b1) is a left kQa -module if and\nonly if there exist ft \u2208 Endk (V ) for any t \u2208 Q1 such that \u03b1 = \u03b1f . That is to say every\nkQa -module is a quiver module.\n(ii) (V, \u03b1) is a left kQa /(\u03c1)-module if and only if there exist ft \u2208 Endk (V ) for any\nt \u2208 Q1 such that \u03b1 = \u03b1f and f\u03c3 = 0 for any \u03c3 \u2208 \u03c1. That is to say every kQa /(\u03c1)-module\nis a factor quiver module.\nObviously, HR \u223c\n= kQa /(\u03c1) as algebras with Q1 = RT , \u03c1 := {tt\u2032 \u2212 t\u2032 t | t, t\u2032 \u2208 RT }.\nUsing Lemma 2.1 we have the following:\nTheorem 2.2. (V, \u03b1) is a left HR -module if and only if there exists ft \u2208 Endk (V ) for\nany t \u2208 RT such that \u03b1 = \u03b1f with f = {ft }t\u2208RT and ft ft\u2032 = ft\u2032 ft for any t, t\u2032 \u2208 RT }.\nExplicitly, in the cases above,\n\u03b1f (t \u2297 v) = t * v := ft (v)\n\n(3)\n\nfor any v \u2208 V, t \u2208 RT .\nLet {pi | i \u2208 Z+ } be a homogeneous basis of P rim(HR ), the set of all primitive elements. By the proof of [Fo, Proposition 8.1], {1} \u222a (\u222a\u221e\nn=1 {pi1 \u22a4pi2 \u22a4 * * * \u22a4pin |\n(i1 , i2 , * * * , in ) \u2208 (Z+ )n }) is a basis of HR . Let {1} \u222a (\u222a\u221e\nn=1 {\u03bei | i = (i1 , i2 , * * * , in ) \u2208\ng\n+ n\n(Z ) }) be its dual basis in HR with < \u03bej , pi1 \u22a4pi2 \u22a4 * * * \u22a4pin >= \u03b4ij for any i, j \u2208\n+ n\n\u222a\u221e\nn=1 (Z ) \u222a {0}, where pi1 \u22a4pi2 \u22a4 * * * \u22a4pin and \u03bej denote 1 when j = i = 0.\n+ n\nLet l(i1 ,i2 ,*** ,in ) \u2208 U(L1 ) with \u03a8(l(i1 ,i2 ,*** ,in ) ) = \u03be(i1 ,i2 ,*** ,in ) for any i \u2208 \u222a\u221e\nn=1 (Z ) \u222a {0}},\n+ n\nwhere \u03a8 is the same as in [Fo, Corollary 3.3]. Therefore, {li | i \u2208 \u222a\u221e\nn=1 (Z ) \u222a {0}} is a\n+ n\nbasis of U(L1 ) and U(L1 ) is the free algebra generated by {li | i \u2208 \u222a\u221e\nn=1 (Z ) \u222a {0}}.\nTheorem 2.3. (V, \u03b1) is a left U(L1 )-module ( or L1 -module ) if and only if there exists\n+ n\n+ n\nfli \u2208 Endk (V ) for any i \u2208 \u222a\u221e\n.\nn=1 (Z ) \u222a{0} such that \u03b1 = \u03b1f with f = {fli }i\u2208(\u222a\u221e\nn=1 (Z ) )\u222a{0}\n4\n\n\fExplicitly, in the cases above,\n\u03b1f (li \u2297 v) = li * v := fli (v)\n\n(4)\n\n+ i\nfor any v \u2208 V, i \u2208 (\u222a\u221e\ni=1 (Z ) ) \u222a {0}.\n\n3\n\nSome properties about Hopf algebras\n\nIn this section we give some properties of the Hopf algebra of rooted trees.\n\n3.1\n\nIntegrals\n\nProposition 3.1. HR , Hladd and U(L1 ) have not any nonzero integrals.\nProof. Let l1 denote the rooted tree with weight (l1 ) = 1. It is clear that subalgebra\nk[l1 ] of HR generated by l1 is a Hopf subalgebra of HR . By [DNR, Proposition 5.6.11],\nk[l1 ] has not any nonzero integral. Therefore, it follows from [DNR, Corollary 5.3.3] that\nHR has not any nonzero integral. Similarly, we can show the other. \u2737\n\n3.2\n\nAndruskiewitsch and Schneider's Conjecture\n\nProposition 3.2. Hladd can not be generated by primitive elements of Hladd as algebras.\nProof. By [Fo, Proposition 9.3 and Theorem 9.5], l2 can not generated by set {Pi |\ni = 1, 2, * * * , * * * }, where Pi is defined in [Fo, Proposition 9.3]. \u2737\nN. Andruskiewitsch and H. J. Schneider in [AS2, Conjecture 1.4] gave a conjecture:\nevery finite dimensional pointed Hopf algebra can be generated by its coradical and its\nskew-primitive elements. By Proposition 3.2, analogue of this conjecture for infinite dimensional pointed Hopf algebra does not hold.\nFurthermore, Hladd and HR are not Nichols algebras over trivial group since (Hladd )(1) 6=\nP rim(Hladd ) and (HR )(1) 6= P rim(HR ). They also are not strictly graded coalgebras (see\n[Sw, P 232]).\n\n3.3\n\nHopf subalgebra\n\nA Hopf algebra H is called trivial, if dim H = 1.\nProposition 3.3. (i) If H is a nontrivial pointed irreducible Hopf algebra, then H has\nnot any finite dimensional nontrivial Hopf subalgebra;\n(ii) HR and U(L1 ) have not any finite dimensional nontrivial Hopf subalgebra.\n\n5\n\n\fProof. (i) Assume that A is a Hopf subalgebra of H with A 6= H0 = k1H . Obviously,\nA0 = k1H and A1 6= A0 , so there exists a nonzero primitive element x \u2208 A1 . By [ZZC,\nLemma 3.5] or [AS1, Lemma 3.3], set {xi | i = 1, 2, * * * } is linearly independent in A, so\nA is infinite dimensional.\n(ii) It immediately follows from (i). \u2737\n\n3.4\n\nGraded duality\n\nBy [Fo, Theorem 3.1], there is a bilinear form <, > on U(L1 ) \u00d7 HR such that\n< 1, h > = \u03b5(h), < Zt , h >= (\n\n\u2202\nh) |t=0 ,\n\u2202t\n\nand < Zt Zt\u2032 , h > = < Zt \u2297 Zt\u2032 , \u2206(h) >\nfor any h \u2208 HR , t, t\u2032 \u2208 RT.\nLemma 3.4. (see [Sw, Section 11.2]) Assume that H = \u2295\u221e\ni=0 H(i) is a local finite graded\ng\n\u221e\nHopf algebra(i.e. dim H(i) < \u221e for any i). Define H := \u2295i=0 (H(i) )\u2217 , called graded dual\nof H. Then H g is a graded Hopf algebra and H \u223c\n= (H g )g as graded Hopf algebra.\n\u2217\n\u25e6\ng\n\u221e\n\u2217\nProof. It is clear that \u2295\u221e\ni=0 (H(i) ) \u2286 H . Now we show that H = \u2295i=0 (H(i) ) is a\ngraded Hopf algebra. Considering [Ni, Pro.1.5.1], we have to prove only that it is a graded\nbialgebra. However, it is easy. Therefore, (H(i) )\u2217 = (H g )(i) for i = 0, 1, 2, * * * .\nFinally, we show that \u03c3H is a graded Hopf algebra isomorphism from H to H gg ,\nwhere < \u03c3H (h), f >=< f, h > for any f \u2208 H \u2217 , h \u2208 H. Indeed, we have to show only\n\u2217\nthat \u03c3H (H) = H gg . For any h \u2208 H(i) , f \u2208 H(j)\n= (H g )(j) with i 6= j, we have that\n< \u03c3H (h), f >=< f, h >= 0, so \u03c3H (h) \u2208 (H gg )(i) . That implies \u03c3H (H) = H gg . \u2737\ngg \u223c\nCorollary 3.5.

However, we have\n\nTheorem 3.6. \u03a6 is not algebraic and \u03a8 is not coalgebraic.\nProof. Let t and t\u2032 are two rooted trees, which are in different equivalent classes. It\nis clear that \u03a6(tt\u2032 )(Zt ) = t\u2032 and < (\u03a6(t) \u2217 \u03a6(t\u2032 )), Zt >= 0, so \u03a6(tt\u2032 ) 6= \u03a6(t) \u2217 \u03a6(t\u2032 ). That\nis, \u03a6 is not algebraic. Similarly, \u03a8 is not coalgebraic. \u2737\n\n4\n\nThe graded Drinfeld double\n\nIn this section we structure the graded Drinfeld double of Hopf algebra of rooted trees\nand show that it is a local quasitriangular Hopf algebra.\n6\n\n\fPn\nLet V = \u2295\u221e\ni=0 V(i) be a local finite graded vector space and Vn :=\ni=0 V(i) for any n \u2208\nN.
