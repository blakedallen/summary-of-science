Introduction\nThe cooperative phenomena, especially phase transitions, have been extensively studied\nand continue to be important subjects until today. They have provided universal paradigm\nfor physics, sociology, and economy. The economical systems composed of a large number of\ninteracting units have been studied from this viewpoint.1, 2 Recently, systemic failure problems\nare being focused upon in econophysics,3\u20137 financial engineering,8\u201312 and computer engineering,13 and many probabilistic models have been proposed. This has been motivated by the\nfact that the description of systemic failures is necessary to control and manage them. Another motivation is that credit risk markets are now growing, and the pricing of products is\nan immediate concern.14 For this purpose, it is necessary to develop probabilistic models that\ncan describe credit risks.\nThe difficulty in the description of systemic failures arises from the fact that they are\nnot independent events. If they are independent, the description is very easy and we only\n\u2217\n\nE-mail address: sakata@complex.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp\nE-mail address: hisakado masato@standardandpoors.com\n\u2021\nE-mail address: mori@sci.kitasato-u.ac.jp\n\n\u2020\n\n1/14\n\n\fJ.

However, there are many phenomena wherein the \"correlation\" between\nthe failure events is very important. For example, in a network of storage systems, if a node\nfails, the failure can propagate to other nodes.\nIn credit risk markets, the same type of risk propagation is found to occur. A percolationtype probabilistic model was proposed to describe bank bankruptcies, where interbank deposits lead to collective credit risks. The probability of l failures obeyed the power law\nP (l) \u223c l1\u2212\u03c4 with the Fisher exponent \u03c4 at its critical point. In a study,8 a default infection mechanism was proposed to describe the risk-dependency structures. The constituents\n\nare obligors, and the risk is whether he (or she) can refund before the expiry date. Such a risk\nis called a default risk. Davis and Lo introduced independent Bernoulli-type random variables\nYij , which describes the infection from a bad obligor j to a good one i. They explicitly obtained the probability function for k defaults, P (k). They estimated the effect of the default\ncorrelation on P (k).\nOne of the crucial problems with these studies is that their it is difficult to describe\nwhether P (k) values do describe the empirical default distribution P (k) or not. Because of\nthe relative scarcity of good data on credit events, it was impossible to compare the models\nby using the empirical data. Recently, from the market quotes on credit risk products, it\nbecomes possible to infer the default distribution function.12, 15 We can compare and calibrate\nthe probabilistic models. In the present paper, we generalize the model proposed by Davis\nand Lo by introducing a recovery effect. We compare the default distribution P (k) with an\nimplied value of that of the credit market and calibrate the model parameters. With regard\nto the bulk shape, we see that the calibrated P (k) value looks similar.\nThe outline of the present paper is as follows. Section 2 gives a brief introduction to\nthe infectious default model proposed by Davis and Lo,8 and we modify it by introducing a\nrecovery process. We obtain the default probability function P (k) for k defaults. In section 3,\nwe take the continuous limit of P (k) with finite Pd and non zero correlation \u03c1 > 0. We find\ntwo non trivial probability distribution functions with a reflection symmetry. They exhibit\noscillating behaviors and we investigate the mechanism. We compare the model distribution\nfunction P (k) with the market implied function in section 4. Section 5 summarizes our results\nand future problems are discussed.\n2. Infectious default model\nWe consider N exchangeable obligors whose states are described by random variables\nSi (i = 1, 2, * * * , N ) such that Si = 1 if obligor i defaults and Si = 0 otherwise. Here, the term\n\"exchangeable\" means the non-dependency of the joint probabilities P (S1 , S2 , * * * , SN ) on the\n\n2/14\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\nexchange of Si \u2194 Sj for any pair of (i, j). The number of defaults is\nK = S1 + S2 + * * * + SN .\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe value of Si is determined as follows. For i = 1, * * * , N and j = 1, * * * , N with j 6= i, let\n\nXi , Yij be independent Bernoulli-type random variables with probability function\nProb.[Xi = 1]\n\n=\n\np,\n\nProb.[Yij = 1]\n\n=\n\nq.\n\n(2.2)\n\nSi are defined as\nSi = Xi + (1 \u2212 Xi )(1 \u2212 \u03a0j6=i (1 \u2212 Yij Xj )).\n\n(2.3)\n\nHere, Xi is the internal state variable which describes whether the obligor is in a good state\n(Xi = 0) or not (Xi = 1). Si is also the state variable that describes whether the obligor is\ndefaulted (Si = 1) or not (Si = 0), this is determined by not only the internal state but also\nthe external environment. If Xi = 1, Si = 1 and the obligor is defaulted. Even if Xi = 0,\nobligor i can be defaulted. Yij represents the influence of another bad obligor (Xj = 1) on\nobligor i. A default infection from a bad obligor j takes place if Yij = 1 and Xj = 1. Si\nbecomes 1 and the obligor is defaulted. The second term of eq.(2.3) represents this effect.\nWe introduce a supporting effect from other good obligors in addition to the default\ninfection. In fact, it may occur that a good obligor supports other bad obligors and the\nlatter can circumvent their defaults. We introduce new independent Bernoulli-type random\nvariables Yij\u2032 in addition to eq.(2.2). For i = 1, * * * , N and j = 1, * * * , N with j 6= i, they have\nthe probability function\n\nProb.[Yij\u2032 = 1] = q \u2032 .\n\n(2.4)\n\nWe introduce the following model equation for Si :\nSi = Xi \u03a0j6=i (1 \u2212 Yij\u2032 (1 \u2212 Xj )) + (1 \u2212 Xi )(1 \u2212 \u03a0j6=i (1 \u2212 Yij Xj )).\n\n(2.5)\n\nEq.(2.5) reveals that even when Xi = 1, if Xj = 0 and Yij\u2032 = 1, obligor i is supported by obligor\nj and avoids being defaulted. We note that eq.(2.5) has a default, non-default symmetry. We\nget 1 \u2212 Si by substituting Xi \u2192 1 \u2212 Xi and Yij \u2194 Yij\u2032 . This model can be reduced to the\noriginal infectious default model by substituting Yij\u2032 = 0 into eq.(2.5).\n\nThe probability distribution function P (k) for k defaults is given by\nP (k) = Prob.[K = k] = N Ck \u00d7\n\nk N\n\u2212k\nX\nX\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03b1p,q,q\nN,k (l, m)\n\n(2.6)\n\nl=0 m=0\n\nwhere\n\u2032\n\n\u03b1p,q,q\nN,k (l, m)\n\n=\n\nk Cl\n\n\u00d7 N \u2212k Cm \u00d7 pN \u2212k\u2212m+l (1 \u2212 p)k\u2212l+m\n\n\u00d7(1 \u2212 q \u2032 )l(k+m\u2212l) (1 \u2212 q)m(N \u2212k\u2212m+l)\n\u00d7(1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q)N \u2212k\u2212m+l )k\u2212l (1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q \u2032 )k+m\u2212l )N \u2212(k+m) .\n3/14\n\n(2.7)\n\n\fJ.

In Fig.1, there are N obligors. k obligors are defaulted\nand N \u2212k obligors are non-defaulted. The k defaulted obligors are classified into two categories:\n\n(A) and (B). (A) contains l bad obligors, which are never supported by other good obligors.\n\n(B) contains k \u2212 l good obligors, which are infected by other bad obligors and thus get\n\ndefaulted. The number of different possible combinations of l items from k different items is\nk Cl .\n\nFurther, there are two categories (C) and (D) for the N \u2212 k non-defaulted obligors. (C)\n\ncontains N \u2212k \u2212m bad obligors and (D) contains m good obligors. The N \u2212k \u2212m bad obligors\n\nare supported by other good obligors and they are prevented from being defaulted. The m\n\ngood obligors are never infected to be defaulted. The number of different possible combinations\nof m items from N \u2212 k different items is\n\nN \u2212k Cm .\n\nIn other words, the conclusive k defaults\n\nand N \u2212 k non-defaults are made from the N \u2212 k \u2212 m + l bad obligors and k \u2212 l + m good\nobligors in the internal configuration by the infection and recovery mechanism. The internal\n\nconfiguration is realized with probability pN \u2212k\u2212m+l (1 \u2212 p)k\u2212l+m . l bad obligors among the\n\nN \u2212 k \u2212 m + l obligors are not supported by the k \u2212 l + m good obligors; this probability is\n\ngiven by (1\u2212 q \u2032 )(k\u2212l+m)l . m good obligors are never infected by N \u2212 k \u2212 m + l bad obligors; this\n\nprobability is given by (1\u2212q)m(N \u2212k\u2212m+l) . k \u2212l good obligors must be infected by N \u2212k \u2212m+l\n\nbad obligors; this probability is given by (1\u2212 (1\u2212 q)N \u2212k\u2212m+l )k\u2212l .

In\nparticular, for large N , there are three solutions. For example, there are three solutions p =\n0.808310, 0.5, and 0.191680 for N = 100, Pd = 0.5, and q = q \u2032 = 0.05. On the other hand,\nthere is only one solution p = 0.5 for N = 50, Pd = 0.5, and q = q \u2032 = 0.05. This is because\nfor arbitrary q, q \u2032 6= 0, Pd behaves as that in Fig.2. Pd (p, q, q \u2032 ) starts from 0 at p = 0 to 1 at\n\np = 1. For intermediate values of p, Pd rapidly increases to 1 and then decreases to 0 near\np = 1 in the large N limit. Thereafter, Pd again increase rapidly to 1 toward p = 1. Such\na behavior can be explained by eq.(2.9). There are three p solutions corresponding to a Pd\nvalue; they are referred to as left, middle and right solutions according to the order of p. The\nparameter region (q, q \u2032 ) in which there are three solutions of p expands with N ; further, for\nthe limit N \u2192 \u221e, it covers the entire parameter space (q > 0, q \u2032 > 0).\n\nThe profiles of the three solutions are shown in Fig.3. We set N = 50, Pd = 0.5, and\n\nq = q \u2032 = 0.2. The three solutions are realized at p = 0.079281 (left), p = 0.5 (middle), and\np = 0.920719 (right). The profiles of the probability distribution functions of the left and\nright solutions are reflection symmetric. The origin of the symmetry arises from the reflection\nsymmetry of eq.(2.5). P (k) for the middle solution (p = 0.5) has a symmetrical profile and is\nalmost a binomial distribution Bi(50, 0.5).\n\n5/14\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\nFig. 2. Plot of Pd vs. p.

Continuous limit and probability distribution function\nIn this section, we consider the continuous limit of eq.(2.7). It is required to take the\nlimit N \u2192 \u221e with non zero correlation because the probability distribution function of the\n\nuncorrelated variables is a binomial distribution. Its continuous limit reduces to a trivial delta\nfunction. We need to consider the continuous limit with fixed Pd and \u03c1. Writing explicitly,\n\u03c1 = (< Si Sj > \u2212 < Si >< Sj >)/Pd (1 \u2212 Pd ) is calculated as\n\u03c1\n\n=\n\n{p2 [(1 + (q \u20322 \u2212 2q \u2032 )(1 \u2212 p))N \u22122 \u2212 (1 \u2212 2q \u2032 (1 \u2212 p) + q \u20322 (1 \u2212 p)2 )N \u22121 ]\n+(1 \u2212 p)2 [(1 + (q 2 \u2212 2q)p)N \u22122 \u2212 (1 \u2212 2qp + q 2 p2 )N \u22121 ]\n\u22122p(1 \u2212 p)[(1 \u2212 p)q(1 \u2212 pq)N \u22122 \u2212 pq \u2032 (1 \u2212 q \u2032 (1 \u2212 p))N \u22122\n+(1 \u2212 q \u2032 )(1 \u2212 q)(1 \u2212 qp \u2212 q \u2032 (1 \u2212 p))N \u22122\n\u2212(1 \u2212 q \u2032 (1 \u2212 p))N \u22121 (1 \u2212 qp)N \u22121 ]}/Pd (1 \u2212 Pd ),\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere\nPd = p(1 \u2212 q \u2032 (1 \u2212 p))N \u22121 + (1 \u2212 p)(1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 qp)N \u22121 ).\n\n(3.2)\n\nThere are three terms in eq.(3.1). The first term is derived from < Xi Xj >, which is proportional to p2 . The second term is derived from < (1 \u2212 Xi )(1 \u2212 Xj ) >, which is proportional\n\nto (1 \u2212 p)2 . The last term is derived from < Xi (1 \u2212 Xj ) > and < (1 \u2212 Xi )Xj >, which is\nproportional to 2p(1 \u2212 p). At least one term must be non-zero in the continuous limit in order\nto retain the correlation. In order to fix Pd in the limit N \u2192 \u221e, it is necessary to set the\n\nparameters p\u00d7q or (1\u2212p)\u00d7q \u2032 to be proportional to 1/N due to the presence of the N th power\n\nin eq.(3.2). To satisfy this condition, we must set p, q, q \u2032 such that the non zero correlation\nis maintained. Using a proportional coefficient \u03b1, if we set p = \u03b1/N , the resulting expression\ncorresponds to the left solution in the previous section. The correlation is maintained due to\nthe first term of eq.(3.1). For p = 1 \u2212 \u03b1/N , the resulting expression corresponds to the right\nsolution; the second term of eq.(3.1) remains. Instead, if we set q, q \u2032 \u221d 1/N and p to be finite,\n6/14\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\nFig. 4. Plot of P (k) for Pd = 0.5, q = q \u2032 =\n\nFig. 5.

The resulting expression\ncorresponds to the middle solution in the previous section and the model becomes a binomial\ndistribution.\nIn the above limit, Pd and \u03c1 can be easily estimated. We set p = \u03b1/N and substitute this\nvalue in eq.(3.1) and eq.(3.2). We obtain\nPd = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1q ,\n\n(3.3)\n\n2\n\n\u03c1=\nIf we set p = 1 \u2212 \u03b1/N , we get\n\ne\u2212\u03b1q (e\u03b1q \u2212 1)\n.\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1q\nPd = e\u2212\u03b1q\n\n\u2032\n\n(3.4)\n\n(3.5)\n\nand\n\u2032\n\n\u20322\n\ne\u2212\u03b1q (e\u03b1q \u2212 1)\n.\n(3.6)\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1q\u2032\nWe see that the above two non trivial solutions can retain their non-zero correlations in the\n\u03c1=\n\ncontinuous limit. From the symmetric property of the model, we note that eq.(3.5) and eq.(3.6)\ncan be derived by the substituting Pd \u2194 1 \u2212 Pd , q \u2194 q \u2032 , and p \u2194 1 \u2212 p in eq.(3.3) and eq.(3.4).\n\nWe show the profiles of the probability distributions P (k) with p = \u03b1/N and p = 1 \u2212 \u03b1/\n\nN in Fig.4 and Fig.5. They show reflection symmetric profiles (k \u2194 N \u2212 k)and have very\nsingular oscillating shapes. Hereafter, we interpret the oscillating behavior based on eq.(2.7).\n\nThe behavior of P (k) can be understood by considering each term in eq.(2.6). It is expressed\n\u2032\n\nas a summation of \u03b1p,q,q\nN,k (l, m).

Comparison with implied default distribution\nWe calibrate our model based on the premiums of iTraxx-CJ (Series 2). iTraxx-CJ is an\nequally weighted portfolio of N = 50 credit default swaps (CDSs) on Japanese companies.\nThe interesting point is that they are divided into several parts (called as \"tranches\"). The\ntranches have priorities that are defined by the attachment point aL and detachment point\naH . The protection seller agrees to cover all the losses between aL KT otal and aH KT otal , where\nKT otal is the initial total notional of the portfolio. That is, if the loss is below aL KT otal , the\n9/14\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\nFig. 7. Plot of default probability distribution for the four cases and the implied distribution on\nAugust 30, 2005.\n\ntranche does not cover it. Only when it exceeds aL KT otal , the tranche begins to cover it. If it\nexceeds aH KT otal , the notional becomes zero. iTraxx-CJ has five tranches and their attachment\nand detachment points are {0%, 3%}, {3%, 6%},{6%, 9%}, {9%, 12%}, and {12%, 22%}. In\n\naddition, there is an index with {0%, 100%}. We denote these tranches as {aiL , aiH }( i =\n1, 2, * * * , 6) and the initial notional as N0i = (aiH \u2212 aiL ) \u00d7 KT otal .\n\nThe premium of these tranches depends on the expectation values of the final notional\n\nprincipal < NTi >, where <\n\n> denotes the average over the probability loss functions of\n\nthe portfolio. If there are k defaults, the loss is expressed as the difference of the notional\nprincipal time and k times the recovery rate R, set at 35%, subtracted from 1.

From these premiums, it is possible to infer the probability loss\nfunction, which is called the \"implied default distribution.\" It describes the probability of\nk defaults of 50 Japanese companies. We denote it by Pimp (k). There are several ways to\ninfer the implied distribution; in Fig.7, we indicate Pimp (k) with a dotted line based on the\nmaximum entropy principle. The default probability Pd is estimated as Pd = 1.65%, and the\ndefault correlation \u03c1 is \u03c1 = 6.8%. It decreases rapidly for small k; for 9 \u2264 k \u2264 20, it is almost\n\nconstant at \u2243 0.1%. Thereafter, Pimp (k) rapidly decays to zero. Details of the inference process\n\nare provided elsewhere.11 Many probabilistic models have been proposed to date, however they\n\nonly yield poor fits to the implied distribution. Here, we calibrate the model parameters p, q,\nand q \u2032 and study whether or not our model effectively fits Pimp (k).\nIn the calibration, we equate the default probability Pd and default correlation \u03c1 of the\nmodel with those of the implied ones. There are three parameters p, q, and q \u2032 in the model,\nwhile there is only one degree of freedom. We study P (k) for the following four cases.\n(1) Default infection only (left): q \u2032 = 0.0, q = 0.054857, and p = 0.004512.\n(2) Recovery infection only (right): q = 0.0, q \u2032 = 0.421050, and p = 0.818175.\n(3) Default infection with recovery (right): q = 0.001, q \u2032 = 0.563790, and p = 0.847362.\n(4) Default infection with recovery (right): q = 0.002, q \u2032 = 0.723940, and p = 0.864563.\nThe P (k) values for the above four cases are shown in Fig.7. In the first case, the model\nexhibits only the default infection mechanism (q \u2032 = 0), and which is indicated with a solid\nline. P (k) exhibits a sharp valley structure at k = 1 and then decreases rapidly to zero at\nk \u2243 20. This profile is clearly different from that of the implied one. On the other hand,\nthe model with the right solution q \u2032 > q and p \u223c 1, where the recovery effect dominates\n\nover the default infection, the bulk profiles are smooth. They are depicted by the symbols\n\u0003(q = 0.0),\n\n(q = 0.001), and \u25b3(q = 0.002). Their profiles are closer to the implied one than\n\nthat of the infection only case. As q increases, the tail becomes short and fat. At q = 0.001\n\nand q = 0.002, they look similar to the implied one. We consider the infectious recovery to be\nimportant to describe the implied default distribution in the framework of infectious models.\nThe P (k) values for the right solutions (cases 2, 3, and 4) have another peak at k = 50. The\npeak means the probability that all the 50 companies default simultaneously. The discrepancy\nfrom Pimp (k) is not very serious, because the inference of the default distribution from market\nquotes depends on the details of the optimization process. Instead of the entropy maximum\nprinciple, if we use another method, the implied distribution might have a peak at k = 50.\nThe reason why the peak appears at this position in the infectious models is that we need\nto set a large value of p for obtaining the right solution. The probability that all 50 companies\nare bad is p50 , and it is non zero; in the case, the recovery infection does not occur because\n11/14\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc.

Premiums for iTraxx-CJ (Series 2) on August 30, 2005, and those derived using our model.\n\nthere are no good companies and P (50) remains. On the other hand, the probability of k < 50\nbad companies and 50 \u2212 k good companies is Pint (k) = 50 Ck * pk (1 \u2212 p)50\u2212k . In this case, 50 \u2212 k\n\ngood companies support k bad companies, and the resulting default number is far less than\nk. Intuitively, probability Pint (k) for k bad companies is shifted to the left and it changes\nto probability P (k\u2032 ) for k\u2032 < k defaults. As q increases, in order to fix Pd and \u03c1, we need\nto increase p and q \u2032 . The peak at k = 50 becomes higher, and the shift of P (k) to the left\nincreases. As a result, P (k) moves to the left.\nIn case 1 where only default infection occurs, the distribution shifts to the right in general.\nIn the case of k = 0 where there are no bad companies, the probability (1 \u2212 p)50 is maintained.\nThe default infection does not occur and P (k) has a peak at k = 0.\n\nWe have also compared the premiums obtained using our model with the real values. The\nfirst row of Table 4 lists the quotes for iTraxx-CJ (Series 2) on August 30, 2005. In the second\nrow, we show the premiums derived using our model with the parameters of the above four\ncases. We find that case (3) realizes the best match with the real premiums. In the table, we\nalso list the premiums based on the Gaussian copula loss function, which is a standard model\nin financial engineering.15 As the model parameter, we use the same Pd and \u03c1 values as the\nimplied one's.\n5. Concluding remarks and future problems\nWe have generalized the infectious default model by incorporating an infectious recovery\neffect. We have explicitly obtained the default probability function P (k) for k defaults as\na function of model parameters p, q, and q \u2032 . We have considered the continuous limit and\nobtained the probability density function p(x) for the default ratio x =\n\nk\nN.\n\nWe have understood\n\nthe oscillating behavior of p(x) by decomposing it, as expressed by eq.(3.14). p(x) is expressed\nas a superposition of the occurrence of n bad obligors and the following default infection. The\nformer follows a Poisson distribution and the latter obeys a normal distribution. The normal\ndistributions have narrow peaks of width \u223c\n\n\u221a1 ,\nN\n\nwhich appear in the oscillating behavior of\n\np(x). We have compared the obtained P (k) with the implied one Pimp (k) inferred from the\n\n12/14\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nFull Paper\n\niTraxx-CJ quotes.\nBy calibrating the model parameters, the profiles appear similar with regard to the bulk\nshape. However, P (k) has a peak at k = 50. We provide an intuitive explanation for it. We\nnote that the principal features of our model are solvability, fitness for the implied distribution,\nand the model can be expressed as a superposition of the Poisson distributions with only three\nparameters.\nIn the future, we should study the time evolution of our model. One possibility is that we\nprepare an initial configuration of Si (t = 0), whose time evolution is expressed as\nSi (t + 1) = Si (t)\u03a0j6=i (1 \u2212 Yij\u2032 (t)(1 \u2212 Sj (t))) + (1 \u2212 Si (t))(1 \u2212 \u03a0j6=i (1 \u2212 Yij (t)Sj (t))).\n\n(5.1)\n\nYij (t) and Yij\u2032 (t) are independent Bernoulli-type variables at each time t, and the configuration of Sj (t) is mapped to a new configuration Si (t + 1). In the original problem, the binomial\ndistribution Bi(N, p) for Xi is transformed into a singular oscillating P (k). We can expect\nmore dynamic and complex behaviors. Furthermore, in addition to the two-body interaction\nYij , Yij\u2032 , three-body or many body interactions might be interesting; this can be achieved by\nmaintaining the integrability of the model, to determine the extent, to which such a generalization is possible. In the continuous limit, the model with a continuous mixing function f (p)\nshould be searched.\nThe model is defined on the complete graph, where all nodes are interconnected. However,\nin recent times, the industry networks have been extensively studied and it has been shown\nthat they have complex structures.19, 20 The behavior of the model on such realistic networks\nis interesting. In addition, the relation between this model and the contact process21\u201323 should\nbe clarified. Despite the evident similarity of our model to the contact process, the infectious\nmodel proposes a new approach to the description of infection. It may be that we can obtain\nthe attribute of the contact process from the infectious models by considering some limit.\nAcknowledgment\nOne of the authors (A.S.) thanks Prof. K. Kaneko and Dr. K.
