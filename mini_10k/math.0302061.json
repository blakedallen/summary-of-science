Certain topological dynamical systems are considered that arise from actions\nof \u03c3-compact locally compact Abelian groups on compact spaces of translation bounded\nmeasures. Such a measure dynamical system is shown to have pure point dynamical spectrum\nif and only if its diffraction spectrum is pure point.\n\n1. Introduction\nThis paper deals with certain dynamical systems build from measures on \u03c3-compact locally\ncompact Abelian groups. These dynamical systems give rise to two spectra: the dynamical\nspectrum and the diffraction spectrum. After introducing the dynamical systems and discussing their basic topological features, we will focus on studying the relationship between\nthese two spectra. Particular attention will be paid to the case where one of the spectra is\npure point. This will be shown to happen if and only if the other is pure point as well (read\non for details and a discussion of related results.)\nThe motivation for our study comes from physics and, more precisely, from the study of\nsolids with long range aperiodic order and crystal-like diffraction spectrum. Such solids are\nknown as genuine quasicrystals. The existence of quasicrystals is now a well-established and\nwidely accepted experimental fact. Even if discussions about the precise structures will still\nbe going on for a while, the common feature of aperiodicity has opened a new chapter of\ncrystallography and solid state research.\nThe original discovery of quasicrystals [35, 19] was somewhat accidental and only possible\nthrough one of their most striking features, namely their sharp Bragg diffraction with point\nsymmetries that are not possible for 3-dimensional crystals (such as n-fold rotation axes with\nn = 8, 10, 12, or icosahedral symmetry); see [1] for a summary and [2] for a guide to the\nliterature. These experimental results called for a mathematical explanation and created a\nsubject now often referred to as mathematical diffraction theory.\nMathematical diffraction theory deals with the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation\nmeasure (or Patterson measure) of a given translation bounded (possibly complex) measure\n\u03c9. Here, \u03c9 is the mathematical idealisation of the physical structure of a solid or, more\ngenerally, of any state of matter. In its simplest form, \u03c9 is just a Dirac comb, i.e., a countable\ncollection of (possibly weighted) point measures which mimic the positions of the atoms (and\ntheir scattering strengths). The autocorrelation measure \u03b3\u03c9 of \u03c9 (see below for a precise\ndefinition) is then a positive definite measure. Its Fourier transform \u03b3c\n\u03c9 is a positive measure,\ncalled the diffraction measure, which models the outcome of a diffraction experiment; see [10]\nfor background material and details on the physical justification of this approach.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMICHAEL BAAKE AND DANIEL LENZ\n\nNow, given this setting, one of the most obvious questions to address is that for (the\ncharacterisation of all) examples of measures \u03c9 with a diffraction measure \u03b3c\n\u03c9 that is pure\npoint, i.e., consists of point measures only.\nThis was addressed by Bombieri and Taylor in [8]. However, no rigorous answer could\nbe given at that time. Soon after, Hof [17] showed that structures obtained from the cutand-project formalism [21] possess a pure point diffraction spectrum under rather decent\nassumptions, and Solomyak started a rather systematic study of substitution dynamical systems with pure point spectrum in [37]. By now, large classes of examples are known [5, 22],\nalso beyond the class of ordinary projection sets [6]. Moreover, Schlottmann was able to free\nthe cut-and-project formalism from basically all specific properties of Euclidean space [33]\nand established that all regular model sets are pure point diffractive [34], see also [26] for a\nsummary on model sets.\nA cornerstone in many of these considerations is the use of ergodic theory and the so-called\nDworkin argument [11] (see [18, 34] as well). This argument links the diffraction spectrum\nto the dynamical spectrum. It can be used to infer pure point diffraction spectrum from\npure point dynamical spectrum. These investigations heavily depend on the underlying point\nsets being point sets of finite local complexity (FLC). This, however, is not necessary, as\nbecomes clear from two alternative approaches, one for general Dirac combs and measures\non the basis of almost periodicity by Moody and one of the authors [5], and the other for\nso-called deformed model sets by Bernuau and Duneau [9].\nThus, at the moment, there is a considerable gap between the cases that can be treated\nby the method of almost periodicity of measures [14, 5] and those using ergodic theory and\nrequiring FLC together with unique ergodicity. It is the primary aim of this article to narrow\nthis gap. This will be achieved by thoroughly analysing the link between the diffraction\nspectrum and the dynamical spectrum given by the Dworkin argument.\nThe analysis carried out below will also be a crucial ingredient in a forthcoming paper of\nours [4] which investigates the stability of pure point diffraction. Namely, we will set up a\nperturbation theory for pure point diffraction by studying deformations of dynamical systems\nwith pure point dynamical spectrum. Particular emphasis will be put on deformed model sets\nand isospectral deformations of Delone sets. Note that the deformation of model sets almost\nimmediately leads to point sets which violate FLC.\nLet us now discuss our results in more detail. The first step in our approach is to choose\na setting of measures rather than point sets. Defining appropriate dynamical systems with\nmeasures on a locally compact Abelian group will free us from essentially all restrictions\nmentioned. This setting is presented in Section 3, where also the relevant topological questions\nare discussed. The relationship between our measure dynamical systems and point dynamical\nsystems is investigated in Section 4. It is shown that the measure dynamical systems enclose\nthe usual Delone dynamical systems. This section introduces a topology on Delone sets\n(and actually all closed subsets of the group) with very nice compactness properties. The\nresults generalise and strengthen the corresponding considerations of [34, 23] and may be\nof independent interest in further studies of point sets not satisfying FLC. The extension of\ndiffraction theory and the Dworkin argument (as developed for point sets in, e.g., [11, 34]) to\nour setting is achieved in Section 5.\nThe main result of our paper is summarised in Theorem 7 in Section 7. It states that,\nunder some rather mild assumptions,\n\n\fPURE POINT SPECTRUM\n\n3\n\n\u2022 pure point dynamical spectrum is equivalent to pure point diffraction spectrum.\nThis generalises the main results of Lee, Moody and Solomyak [22] in at least three ways:\nIt is not restricted to dynamical systems arising from Delone sets, and, in fact, not even\nto dynamical systems arising from point sets. It does not need any condition of finite local\ncomplexity. It does not need an ergodicity assumption for the invariant measure involved.\nLet us mention that a generalisation of the main result of [22] sharing the last two features\nhad already been announced by Gou\u00e9r\u00e9 [15, 16], within the framework of point processes\nand Palm measures, see his recent work [15] for a study of this framework as well. His result\napplies to the point dynamical systems studied below in Section 4. Thus, there is some overlap\nbetween his result an ours. However, in general, our setting, methods and results are quite\ndifferent from his, as we leave the scenario of point sets. In fact, the measure theoretical\nsetting seems very adequate and natural in view of the physical applications, where point sets\nare only a somewhat crude approximation of the arrangements of scatterers.\nLet us also mention that, in general, the diffraction spectrum and the dynamical spectrum\ncan be of different type, as has been investigated by van Enter and Mi\u0229kisz in [12].\nOur proof of the equivalence of the two notions of pure pointedness relies on two results\nwhich are of interest in their own right. These results are\n\u2022 an abstract characterisation of pure point dynamical spectrum for arbitrary topological dynamical systems,\n\u2022 a precise interpretation of the Dworkin argument.\nHere, the abstract characterisation is achieved in Theorem 1 in Section 2. Roughly speaking,\nit states that a system has pure point spectrum once it has a lot of point spectrum. The\nprecise interpretation of the Dworkin argument is given in Theorem 6 in Section 6. It says\nthat the diffraction measure is a spectral measure for a suitable subrepresentation of the\ntranslation action at hand.\nThe relationship between suitable subrepresentation with pure point spectrum and the\noriginal representation can actually be analysed in more detail. To do so, we take a second look\nat the abstract theory in Section 8. Namely, we discuss how the group of all eigenvalues and\nthe continuity of eigenfunctions is already determined by the set of eigenvalues and continuity\nof eigenfunctions associated to a suitable subrepresentation with pure point spectrum.\nThis material is rather general and may be of independent interest. Here, we apply it to\nour topological measure dynamical systems. This gives a criterion for the continuity of the\neigenfunctions. More importantly, it shows that the group of all eigenvalues is generated by\nthe support of the diffraction spectrum. The validity of such a result was brought to our\nattention by R. V. Moody for the case of point dynamical systems satisfying FLC [27].\nThe material presented above, and the abstract strategy to prove our main result, can be\nadopted to study a measurable framework (as opposed to a topological one). This will be\nanalysed in the future.\n\n2. An abstract criterion\nIn this section, we introduce some notation and provide a simple result which lies at the\nheart of our considerations. It is rather general and might also be useful elsewhere.\n\n\f4\n\nMICHAEL BAAKE AND DANIEL LENZ\n\nLet \u03a9 be a compact topological space (by which we mean to include the Hausdorff property)\nand G be a locally compact Abelian (LCA) group which is \u03c3-compact. Let\n(1)\n\n\u03b1 : G \u00d7 \u03a9 \u2212\u2192 \u03a9\n\nbe a continuous action of G on \u03a9, where, of course, G \u00d7 \u03a9 carries the product topology\n(later on, we will specify it via \u03b1t (P ) = t + P for P \u2282 G and t \u2208 G). Then, (\u03a9, \u03b1) is\ncalled a topological dynamical system. The set of continuous functions on \u03a9 will be denoted\nby C(\u03a9). Let m be a G-invariant probability measure on \u03a9 and denote the corresponding\nset of square integrable\nfunctions on \u03a9 by L2 (\u03a9, m). This space is equipped with the inner\nR\nproduct hf, gi := f (\u03c9)g(\u03c9) dm(\u03c9). The action \u03b1 induces a unitary representation T of G\non L2 (\u03a9, m) in the obvious way, where T t h is defined by (T t h)(\u03c9) := h(\u03b1\u2212t (\u03c9)). Whenever\nwe want to emphasise the dependence of the inner product and the unitary representation on\nthe chosen invariant measure m, we write hf, gim and Tm instead of hf, gi and T .\nb and the pairing between a character \u015d \u2208 G\nb and an\nThe dual group of G is denoted by G,\nelement t \u2208 G is written as (\u015d, t), which, of course, is a number on the unit circle, compare\n[31, Ch. 4] for background material.\nA non-zero h \u2208 L2 (\u03a9, m) is called an eigenvector (or eigenfunction) of T if there exists an\nb with T t h = (\u015d, t)h for every t \u2208 G. The closure (in L2 (\u03a9, m)) of the linear span of all\n\u015d \u2208 G\neigenfunctions of T will be denoted by Hpp (T ).\nThe following is a variant (and an extension) of a result from [22].\nLemma 1. Let (\u03a9, \u03b1) be a topological dynamical system with an invariant measure m. Then,\nHpp (T )\u2229C(\u03a9) is a subalgebra of C(\u03a9) which is closed under complex conjugation and contains\nall constant functions. Similarly, Hpp (T ) \u2229 L\u221e (\u03a9, m) is a subalgebra of L\u221e (\u03a9, m) that is\nclosed under complex conjugation and contains all constant functions.\nProof. We only show the statement about Hpp (T ) \u2229 C(\u03a9). The other result can be shown in\nthe same way.\nThe set Hpp (T ) \u2229 C(\u03a9) is a vector space because it is the intersection of two vector spaces.\nMoreover, every constant (non-vanishing) function is obviously continuous and an eigenvector\nof T (with eigenvalue 1, i.e., with the trivial character (\u015d, t) \u2261 1).\nIt remains to be shown that Hpp (T ) \u2229 C(\u03a9) is closed under complex conjugation and under\nforming products.\nClosedness under complex conjugation: Let f be an eigenfunction of T to, say, \u015d. Then,\nb is\nf is an eigenfunction of T to the character \u015d\u22121 . Here, of course, the inverse \u015d\u22121 of \u015d \u2208 G\ngiven by t 7\u2192 (\u015d, t), where the bar denotes complex conjugation. Using this, it is not hard to\nsee that Hpp (T ) is closed under complex conjugation. As this is true of C(\u03a9) as well, we see\nthat the intersection Hpp (T ) \u2229 C(\u03a9) is closed under complex conjugation.\nClosedness under products: This is shown in Lemma 3.7 in [22] in the case that m is not\nonly translation invariant but also ergodic. To adopt their argument to the case at hand, we\nnote that every eigenfunction can be approximated arbitrarily well (in L2 (\u03a9, m)) by bounded\neigenfunctions via a simple cut-off procedure. More precisely, if f is an eigenfunction, then\n|f | is an \u03b1-invariant function. Therefore, for an arbitrary N > 0, the function\n(\nf (\u03c9), |f (\u03c9)| \u2264 N\n(2)\nf N (\u03c9) :=\n0,\notherwise\n\n\fPURE POINT SPECTRUM\n\n5\n\nis again an eigenfunction (with the same \u015d as f ). Apparently, the f N converge to f in\nL2 (\u03a9, m) as N \u2192 \u221e.\nAfter this preliminary consideration, we can conclude the proof following [22]: Let two\nfunctions f, g \u2208 Hpp (T ) \u2229 C(\u03a9) be given. Then, f g belongs to C(\u03a9). It remains to be shown\nthat it belongs to Hpp (T ) as well.\nChoose \u03b5 > 0 arbitrarily. Observe that kgk\u221e < \u221e, as gP\n\u2208 C(\u03a9) with \u03a9 compact. Since f\nis in Hpp (T ), there exists a finite linear combination f \u2032 =\nai fi of eigenfunctions of T with\nX\n\u03b5\nkf \u2212\nai fi k2 \u2264\n.\nkgk\u221e\n\nBy the preliminary consideration around Eq. (2), we can assume that all fi are bounded\nfunctions. Thus, in particular, kf \u2032 k\u221e < \u221e.\nP\nSimilarly, choose another finite linear combination g\u2032 =\nbj gj of bounded functions gj in\nHpp (T ) with\nX\n\u03b5\n.\nkg \u2212\nbj gj k2 \u2264\nkf \u2032 k\u221e\nThen,\nkf g \u2212 f \u2032 g\u2032 k2 \u2264 kf \u2032 k\u221e kg \u2212 g\u2032 k2 + kgk\u221e kf \u2212 f \u2032 k2 \u2264 2\u03b5.\nThe proof is complete by observing that f \u2032 g \u2032 is in Hpp (T ) because the product of bounded\neigenfunctions is again a bounded eigenfunction.\n\u0003\nWith Lemma 1, the following result is a rather direct consequence of the Stone-Weierstrass\nTheorem.\nTheorem 1.\nm. Then, the\n(a) T has\n(b) There\n\nLet (\u03a9, \u03b1) be a topological dynamical system with invariant probability measure\nfollowing assertions are equivalent.\npure point spectrum, i.e., Hpp (T ) = L2 (\u03a9, m).\nexists a subspace V \u2282 Hpp (T ) \u2229 C(\u03a9) which separates points.\n\nProof. (a) =\u21d2 (b): This is clear, as one can take V = Hpp (T ) \u2229 C(\u03a9) = C(\u03a9).\n(b) =\u21d2 (a): By Lemma 1, Hpp (T ) \u2229 C(\u03a9) is an algebra which is closed under complex\nconjugation and contains the constant functions. It also separates points as it contains a\nsubspace, V, with this property by (b). Thus, we can apply the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem\n(compare [28, Thm. 4.3.4]), to conclude that Hpp (T ) \u2229 C(\u03a9) is dense in C(\u03a9). By standard\nmeasure theory, see [28, Prop. 6.4.11], Hpp (T ) is then dense in L2 (\u03a9, m) as well. As Hpp (T )\nis closed, statement (a) follows.\n\u0003\n3. Measure dynamical systems\nFor the remainder of the paper, let G be a fixed \u03c3-compact\nLCA group with identity 0.\nR\nIntegration with respect to Haar measure is denoted by G . . . dt, and the measure of a subset\nD of G is denoted by |D|. The vector space of complex valued continuous functions on G\nwith compact support is denoted by Cc (G). It is made into a locally convex space by the\ninductive limit topology, as induced by the canonical embeddings\nCK (G) \u0592\u2192 Cc (G) ,\n\nK \u2282 G compact.\n\nHere, CK (G) is the space of complex valued continuous functions on G with support in K,\nwhich is equipped with the usual supremum norm k.k\u221e . The support of \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G) is denoted\nby supp(\u03c6).\n\n\f6\n\nMICHAEL BAAKE AND DANIEL LENZ\n\nThe dual Cc (G)\u2217 of the locally convex space Cc (G) is denoted by M(G). The space M(G)\ncarries the vague topology. This topology equals the weak-\u2217 topology of Cc (G)\u2217 , i.e., it is the\nweakest topology which makes all functionals \u03bc 7\u2192 \u03bc(\u03c6), \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G), continuous. As is well\nknown (see e.g. [28, Thm. 6.5.6] together with its proof), every \u03bc \u2208 M(G) gives rise to a\nunique |\u03bc| \u2208 M(G), called the total variation of \u03bc, which satisfies\n|\u03bc|(\u03c6) = sup {|\u03bc(\u03c8)| : \u03c8 \u2208 Cc (G, R) with |\u03c8| \u2264 \u03c6}\nfor every \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G)+ . Apparently, the total variation |\u03bc| is positive, i.e., |\u03bc|(\u03c6) \u2265 0 for all\n\u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G)+ . In particular, it can be identified with a measure on the \u03c3-algebra of Borel sets\nof G that satisfies\n\u2022 |\u03bc|(K) < \u221e for every compact set K \u2282 G,\n\u2022 |\u03bc|(A) = sup {|\u03bc|(K) : K \u2282 A, K compact} for every Borel set A \u2282 G\n(see, e.g., [28, Thm. 6.3.4]). As G is \u03c3-compact, we furthermore have\n\u2022 |\u03bc|(A) = inf{|\u03bc|(B) : A \u2282 B, B open} for every Borel set A \u2282 G\nby [28, Prop. 6.3.6], i.e., |\u03bc| is an (unbounded) regular Borel measure, in line with the RieszMarkov Theorem [30, Thm. IV.18]. Finally, we note that there exists, by [28, Thm. 6.5.6], a\nmeasurable function u : G \u2212\u2192 C with |u(t)| = 1 for |\u03bc|-almost every t \u2208 G such that\nZ\n\u03c6 u d|\u03bc| for all \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G).\n(3)\n\u03bc(\u03c6) =\nG\n\nThis polar decomposition permits us to identify the elements of M(G) with the regular\ncomplex Borel measures on G, which is the Riesz-Markov Theorem for this situation.\nFor later use, we also introduce some notation concerning Fourier transforms and convolutions, compare [32, 7] for details. The Fourier transform of a quantity\n\u0001 q will Ralways be denoted\nby qb. For \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 Cc (G), we define the convolution \u03c6 \u2217 \u03c8 by \u03c6 \u2217 \u03c8 (t) := G \u03c6(s)\u03c8(t \u2212 s) ds\nand the function \u03c6\ne \u2208 Cc (G) by \u03c6(t)\ne\n:= \u03c6(\u2212t). \u0001 For \u03bc R\u2208 M(G) and \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G), the\nconvolution \u03c6 \u2217 \u03bc is the function given by \u03c6 \u2217 \u03bc (t) := G \u03c6(t \u2212 s) d\u03bc(s). For two convolvable\n\u0001 measures\nR R \u03bc, \u03bd \u2208 M(G), the convolution \u03bc \u2217 \u03bd is the element of M(G) given by\ne and \u03bc are defined by\n\u03bc \u2217 \u03bd (\u03c6) := G G \u03c6(s + t) d\u03bc(s) d\u03bd(t) for \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G); the measures \u03bc\ne and \u03bc(\u03c6) := \u03bc(\u03c6), respectively. For \u03bc \u2208 M(G) and a measurable set B \u2282 G,\n\u03bc\ne(\u03c6) := \u03bc(\u03c6)\nwe denote the restriction of \u03bc to B by \u03bcB . Finally, for x \u2208 G, we define the measure \u03b4x to be\nthe normalised point measure at x.\nWe will consider actions of G on spaces consisting of measures on G. The relevant set of\nmeasures will be defined next.\nDefinition 1. Let C > 0 and a relatively compact open set V in G be given. A measure\n\u03bc \u2208 M(G) is called (C, V )-translation bounded if |\u03bc|(t + V ) \u2264 C for all t \u2208 G. It is simply\ncalled translation bounded if there exist C, V such that it is (C, V )-translation bounded. The\nset of all (C, V )-translation bounded measures is denoted by MC,V (G) and the set of all\ntranslation bounded measures by M\u221e (G).\nThe vague topology on M(G) has very nice features when restricted to the translation\nbounded measures.\nTheorem 2. Let C > 0 and a relatively compact open set V in G be given. Then, MC,V (G)\nis a compact Hausdorff space. If G is second countable, MC,V (G) is metrisable.\n\n\fPURE POINT SPECTRUM\n\n7\n\nTo prove the theorem, we start with the following simple result from measure theory.\nProposition 1. Let \u03bc \u2208 M(G) and a relatively compact open set V in G be given. Then,\n|\u03bc|(V ) = sup {|\u03bc(\u03c6)| : \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G) with supp(\u03c6) \u2282 V and k\u03c6k\u221e \u2264 1}.\nProof. Denote the supremum in the statement by S. Recall the polar decomposition and the\ndefinition of u in Eq. (3). As u is |\u03bc| almost surely equal to 1, a direct calculation easily\ngives S \u2264 |\u03bc|(V ). Conversely, as Cc (V ) is dense in L1 (V, |\u03bc|V ) (see, e.g., [28, Prop. 6.4.11]),\nn\u2192\u221e\nthere exists a sequence (\u03c6n ) in Cc (V ) with \u03c6n \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 u * 1V in L1 (V, |\u03bc|V ) . By the |\u03bc|-almost\nn\u2192\u221e\nsure boundedness of u, this implies u\u03c6n \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 uu * 1V = 1V in L1 (V, |\u03bc|V ). Then, a short\ncalculation, invoking (3) again, shows S \u2265 limn\u2192\u221e |\u03bc(\u03c6n )| = |\u03bc|(V ). This proves the\nproposition.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 2. By definition of MC,V (G), for each \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G), there exists a radius\nR(\u03c6) > 0 such that \u03bc(\u03c6) \u2208 BR(\u03c6) for every \u03bc \u2208 MC,V (G), where Br is the (open) ball of\nradius r around 0 and Br its closure. Thus, we can consider MC,V (G) as a subspace of\nQ\n\u03a0 := \u03c6\u2208Cc (G) BR(\u03c6) equipped with the product topology via the embedding\n\u0001\nj : MC,V (G) \u0592\u2192 \u03a0 ,\nj(\u03bc) (\u03c6) := \u03bc(\u03c6).\n\nAs \u03a0 is obviously a compact Hausdorff space, this shows immediately that MC,V (G) is\nrelatively compact and Hausdorff. It remains to be shown that j(MC,V (G)) is closed. This\nis a direct consequence of Definition 1 together with Proposition 1.\nThe statement about metrisability is standard: if G is second countable, there exists a\ncountable dense subset {\u03c6n : n \u2208 N} in Cc (G). Then,\nX\n|\u03bc(\u03c6n ) \u2212 \u03bd(\u03c6n )|\nd : MC,V (G) \u00d7 MC,V (G) \u2212\u2192 R , d(\u03bc, \u03bd) :=\n2\u2212n\n1 + |\u03bc(\u03c6n ) \u2212 \u03bd(\u03c6n )|\nn\u2208N\n\ngives a metric on MC,V (G) which generates the topology.\n\u0003\nHaving discussed the topology of M(G), we can now introduce the topological dynamical\nsystems associated to subsets of M(G). To do so, we will use the obvious action \u03b1 of G on\nM(G) given by\n\n\u03b1 : G \u00d7 M(G) \u2212\u2192 M(G) , (t, \u03bc) 7\u2192 \u03b1t (\u03bc) := \u03b4t \u2217 \u03bc,\n\u0001\nR\nor, more explicitly, \u03b1t (\u03bc) (\u03c6) = G \u03c6(t + s) d\u03bc(s). We use the same symbol for the action as\nin Eq. (1), since misunderstandings are unlikely, and we will usually write \u03b1t \u03bc for \u03b1t (\u03bc).\nThis action is compatible with the topological structure of G and M(G).\nProposition 2. Let C > 0 and a relatively compact open set V \u2282 G be given. Then, the\naction \u03b1 : G\u00d7MC,V (G) \u2212\u2192 MC,V (G) is continuous, where G\u00d7MC,V (G) carries the product\ntopology.\nProof. Let (t\u03b9 , \u03bc\u03b9 ) be a net in G \u00d7 MC,V (G) converging to (t, \u03bc). We have to show that the\nnet (\u03b1t\u03b9 (\u03bc\u03b9 )) converges to \u03b1t (\u03bc), i.e., we have to check that\nZ\nZ\n\u03c6(s + t\u03b9 ) d\u03bc\u03b9 (s) \u2212\u2192\n\u03c6(s + t) d\u03bc(s) , for all \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G).\nBy t\u03b9 \u2212\u2192 t, there exists an index \u03b90 and a compact set K such that the support of \u03c6 and the\nsupports of all \u03c6\u03b9 with \u03b9 \u2265 \u03b90 are contained in K. Moreover, as \u03bc\u03b9 \u2208 MC,V (G) for every \u03b9,\n\n\f8\n\nMICHAEL BAAKE AND DANIEL LENZ\n\nthere exists a constant C \u2032 with |\u03bc|(K) \u2264 C \u2032 as well as |\u03bc\u03b9 |(K) \u2264 C \u2032 for all \u03b9. Now, the desired\nstatement follows easily from\n|\u03bc\u03b9 (\u03c6(. + t\u03b9 )) \u2212 \u03bc(\u03c6(. + t))| \u2264 |\u03bc\u03b9 (\u03c6(. + t\u03b9 )) \u2212 \u03bc\u03b9 (\u03c6(. + t))| + |\u03bc\u03b9 (\u03c6(. + t)) \u2212 \u03bc(\u03c6(. + t))|\n\u2264 |\u03bc\u03b9 |(C)k\u03c6(. + t\u03b9 ) \u2212 \u03c6(. + t)k\u221e + |\u03bc\u03b9 (\u03c6(. + t)) \u2212 \u03bc(\u03c6(. + t))|,\nas both terms on the right hand side tend to zero for t\u03b9 \u2212\u2192 t and \u03bc\u03b9 \u2212\u2192 \u03bc.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe dynamical systems we are interested in are defined as follows.\nDefinition 2. (\u03a9, \u03b1) is called a dynamical system on the translation bounded measures on\nG (TMDS) if there exist a constant C > 0 and a relatively compact open V \u2282 G such that \u03a9\nis a closed subset of MC,V (G) that is invariant under the G-action \u03b1.\nRemarks. (a) The \u03b1 invariant subsets of M(G) are called translation stable sets in [14].\nThus, a TDMS is just a closed translation stable subset of MC,V (G).\n(b) The space \u03a9 of a TMDS is always compact by Theorem 2 and the action \u03b1 is continuous\nby Proposition 2. Thus, a TMDS is a topological dynamical system in the sense of Section 2.\n(c) The considerations of this section (and those of the next) do not use commutativity of\nthe underlying group G. They immediately extend to arbitrary \u03c3-compact locally compact\ngroups. But since we need harmonic analysis later on, we stick to Abelian groups here.\n4. Point dynamical systems\nThis section has two aims. Firstly, we present an abstract topological framework which\nallows us to treat point dynamical systems which are not of finite local complexity. Secondly,\nwe show how these systems fit into our setting of measure dynamical systems. As for the first\naim, we actually introduce a topology on the set of all closed subsets of G. For the case of\nRd , this topology has already been studied by Stollmann and one of the authors in [23]. Our\nextension to arbitrary locally compact groups is strongly influenced by the investigation of\nSchlottmann [34] (which, however, is restricted to FLC systems).\nAs pointed out by the referee, the topology we introduce can also be obtained as a special\ncase of a topology introduced by Fell in [13]. This is further discussed in the appendix. Given\nthis connection, Theorem 3 below is a corollary of Theorem 1 in [13]. For this reason, we only\ngive an outline of how it can be established in our setting.\nWe start by defining the relevant sets of points.\nDefinition 3. Let G be a \u03c3-compact LCA group, and V an open neighbourhood of 0 in G.\n(a) A subset \u039b of G is called V-discrete if every translate of V contains at most one point\nof \u039b. The set of all V-discrete subsets of G is denoted by DV (G).\n(b) A subset of G is called uniformly discrete if it is V-discrete for some V. The set of\nall uniformly discrete subsets of G is denoted as U D(G).\n(c) The set of all discrete and closed subsets of G will be denoted by D(G).\n(d) The set of all closed subsets of G is denoted as C(G).\n(e) A subset \u039b of G is called relatively dense if there is a compact K with \u039b + K = G.\nNote that a uniformly discrete subset of G is closed. As it presents no extra difficulty,\nwe will actually topologise not only D(G) but rather the larger set C(G). This will be done\n\n\fPURE POINT SPECTRUM\n\n9\n\nby providing a suitable uniformity (see [20, Ch. 6] for details on uniformities). Namely, for\nK \u2282 G compact and V a neighbourhood of 0 in G, we set\nUK,V := {(P1 , P2 ) \u2208 C(G) \u00d7 C(G) : P1 \u2229 K \u2282 P2 + V and P2 \u2229 K \u2282 P1 + V }.\nIt is not hard to check that\n\u22121\n, UK1 \u222aK2 ,V1 \u2229V2 \u2282 UK1 ,V1 \u2229 UK2 ,V2 , UK\u2212W,W \u25e6 UK\u2212W,W \u2282 UK,V\n(P, P ) \u2208 UK,V , UK,V = UK,V\n\nfor V a neighbourhood of 0, W a compact neighbourhood of 0 with W + W \u2282 V , K in G\ncompact, and P any closed subset of G. Here, on sets U, U1 , U2 consisting of ordered pairs,\nwe define U \u22121 := {(y, x) : (x, y) \u2208 U } and\nU1 \u25e6 U2 := {(x, z) : \u2203 y \u2208 G with (x, y) \u2208 U1 and (y, z) \u2208 U2 }.\nThis guarantees that {UK,V : K compact, V open with 0 \u2208 V } generates a uniformity, and\nhence a topology on C(G) via the neighbourhoods\nUK,V (P ) := {Q : (Q, P ) \u2208 UK,V } ,\n\nP \u2208 C(G) .\n\nNote that we could equally well generate the same uniformity with V running through compact\nneighbourhoods of 0 \u2208 G.\nDefinition 4. The topology defined this way is called the local rubber topology (LRT).\nThis topology essentially means that two sets P1 , P2 are close if they \"almost\" agree on\nlarge compact sets.\nFundamental properties of the LRT are given in the following result (see [23] for an earlier\nresult on Rd ).\nTheorem 3. With the LRT, the set C(G) of closed subsets of G is a compact Hausdorff\nspace. If the topology of G has a countable base, then C(G) is metrisable.\nProof. The set C(G) is Hausdorff, as the intersection of all UK,V contains only the diagonal\nset {(P, P ) : P \u2208 C(G)}, see [20, Ch. 6].\nWe next show completeness: Let (P\u03b9 )\u03b9\u2208I be a Cauchy net in C(G), where I is an index set\ndirected by \u2264, compare [20, Ch. 2].\nWe have to show that the Cauchy net converges to a closed subset of G, hence an element of\nC(G). To this end, we introduce the set P of those x \u2208 G such that, for every neighbourhood\nV of 0, there exists \u03b9x,V \u2208 I with\n(4)\n\n(x + V ) \u2229 P\u03b9 6= \u2205\n\nfor all \u03b9 \u2265 \u03b9x,V .\n\nIt is not hard to see that P is closed. P will turn out to be the limit of our Cauchy net.\nTo show this, let a compact K in G and a neighbourhood V of 0 be given. We have to\nprovide an \u03b9K,V with\nP \u2229 K \u2282 P\u03b9 + V\n\nand\n\nP\u03b9 \u2229 K \u2282 P + V\n\nfor every \u03b9 \u2265 \u03b9K,V .\nRather direct arguments show existence of \u03b9K,V with P \u2229 K \u2282 P\u03b9 + V for all \u03b9 \u2265 \u03b9K,V . We\nnext establish the other inclusion. By a compactness argument,\n(5)\n\nP \u2229 C 6= \u2205,\n\n\f10\n\nMICHAEL BAAKE AND DANIEL LENZ\n\nwhenever C \u2282 G is compact and P\u03ba \u2229C 6= \u2205 for all \u03ba \u2265 \u03ba0 and some \u03ba0 \u2208 I. Assume, without\nloss of generality, that V is compact and symmetric. As (P\u03b9 ) is a Cauchy net, there exists\na \u03b9K,V with (P\u03b9 , P\u03ba ) \u2208 UK,V for all \u03b9, \u03ba \u2265 \u03b9K,V . Consider \u03b9 \u2265 \u03b9K,V and choose an arbitrary\nq \u2208 P\u03b9 \u2229 K. Then,\n(q + V ) \u2229 P\u03ba 6= \u2205\nfor every \u03ba \u2265 \u03b9K,V , as V is symmetric and P\u03b9 \u2229 K \u2282 P\u03ba + V by (P\u03b9 , P\u03ba ) \u2208 UK,V . Thus, (5)\ngives existence of a p \u2208 P with p \u2208 q + V . In particular, invoking the symmetry of V once\nmore, we have q \u2208 p + V \u2282 P + V . As q \u2208 P\u03b9 \u2229 K was arbitrary, we infer the desired inclusion\nP\u03b9 \u2229 K \u2282 P + V .\nThese considerations prove the desired completeness statement.\nFinally, we show compactness of C(G). As C(G) is complete, it suffices to prove it is\nprecompact. Thus, for any given K compact and V an open neighbourhood of 0Sin G, we have\nto provide a natural number n and Pi \u2208 C(G), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, such that C(G) \u2282 ni=1 UK,V (Pi ).\nSince UK,V (P ) \u2283 UK,V \u2229(\u2212V ) (P ) for all P \u2208 C(G) and V \u2229 (\u2212V ) is symmetric, we can assume,\nwithout loss of generality, that V is symmetric (i.e., V = \u2212V ). As K is compact, there exists\na finite set D \u2282 K with K \u2282 D + V. Direct calculations then give\nC(G) \u2282\n\nn\n[\n\nUK,V (Di ),\n\ni=1\n\nwhere Di , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, is an enumeration of the power set of D.\nThe statement about metrisability is a direct consequence of [20, Thm. 6.13] and the remark\nthereafter.\n\u0003\nHaving topologised C(G), and thus U D(G) as well, we can now introduce our point dynamical systems. The natural action of G on C(G) by translation will also be denoted by \u03b1.\nExplicitly, we define \u03b1t (P ) = t + P for P \u2208 C(G), where t + P = {t + x : x \u2208 P } as usual.\nDefinition 5. Let \u03a9 be a subset of G and \u03b1 the translation action just defined.\n(a) The pair (\u03a9, \u03b1) is called a set dynamical system if \u03a9 is a closed subset of C(G)\nwhich is invariant under \u03b1.\n(b) A set dynamical system (\u03a9, \u03b1) is called a point dynamical system if \u03a9 is a subset of\nDV (G) for some open neighbourhood V of 0.\n(c) A point dynamical system (\u03a9, \u03b1) is called a Delone dynamical system, if every element\nof \u03a9 is a relatively dense subset of G.\nIt follows from Theorem 3 that a set dynamical system is indeed a topological dynamical\nsystem in the sense of Section 2.\nA special way of obtaining set dynamical systems is the following: Choose P \u2208 C(G). Then,\nthe LRT-closure X(P ) of the orbit {\u03b1t (P ) : t \u2208 G} of P in C(G) is a closed \u03b1-invariant subset\nof C(G), hence compact. Thus, (X(P ), \u03b1) is a set dynamical system. We say that P and P \u2032\nare locally indistinguishable if P \u2282 X(P \u2032 ) and P \u2032 \u2282 X(P ), hence if X(P ) = X(P \u2032 ). The set\nof all P \u2032 which are locally indistinguishable form P is called the RLI class of P , written as\nRLI(P ). Here, as before, the letter R stands for \"rubber\".\nGiven these notions, we can characterise minimality of a set dynamical system in the\nfollowing way, which extends [34, Prop. 3.1] to our setting.\n\n\fPURE POINT SPECTRUM\n\n11\n\nProposition 3. Let P \u2208 C(G) be given. Then, the following assertions are equivalent.\n(a) The set dynamical system (X(P ), \u03b1) is minimal.\n(b) X(P ) = RLI(P ).\n(c) The set {t \u2208 G : (t + P, P ) \u2208 UK,V } is relatively dense in G for all compact K \u2282 G\nand all open neighbourhoods V of 0.\n(d) The set P is repetitive, i.e., for every K compact and every open neighbourhood V\nof 0, there is a compact set C = C(K, V ) \u2282 G such that, for t1 , t2 \u2208 G, there is an\ns \u2208 C with (t1 + P, s + t2 + P ) \u2208 UK,V .\nProof. The equivalence of (a) and (b) is clear by the definition of minimality and the local indistinguishability class. This is also known as Gottschalk's Theorem, compare [29,\nThm. 4.1.2]. The remaining assertions can be shown by mimicking and slightly extending the\nproof of [34, Prop. 3.1]. Since we do not use these results later on, we skip further details. \u0003\nHaving discussed point dynamical systems, we can now relate them to special dynamical\nsystems on measures. The connection relies on the map\nX\n\u03b4 : U D(G) \u2212\u2192 M\u221e (G) , \u03b4(\u039b) :=\n\u03b4x ,\nx\u2208\u039b\n\nNote that \u03b4 is indeed a map into\n\nM\u221e (G),\n\nas every \u039b \u2208 U D(G) is uniformly discrete.\n\nLemma 2. The map \u03b4 : U D(G) \u2212\u2192 M\u221e (G) is injective, continuous and compatible with\nthe action of G. The inverse \u03b4\u22121 : \u03b4(U D(G)) \u2212\u2192 U D(G) is continuous as well.\nProof. Injectivity and compatibility with the action of G are immediate. In particular, using\n\u03b4t+x = \u03b4t \u2217 \u03b4x , one can check that\n\u03b4(\u03b1t (\u039b)) = \u03b4(t + \u039b) = \u03b4t \u2217 \u03b4(\u039b) = \u03b1t (\u03b4(\u039b)) .\nTo show continuity of \u03b4, we have to show \u03b4(\u039b\u03b9 )(\u03c6) \u2212\u2192 \u03b4(\u039b)(\u03c6) for all \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G), whenever\n\u039b\u03b9 \u2212\u2192 \u039b. Let V be an open neighbourhood of 0 in G such that \u039b \u2208 DV (G). Let \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G)\nbe given,\nP so supp(\u03c6) is compact. By a simple partition of unity argument, we can now write\n\u03c6 = nj=1 \u03c6j , where each \u03c6j , j = 1, . . . , n, has its support in a set of the form W + tj , with\nW + W \u2282 V . Now, for such \u03c6j , the convergence \u03b4(\u039b\u03b9 )(\u03c6j ) \u2212\u2192 \u03b4(\u039b)(\u03c6j ) follows easily. This\nyields the desired convergence for \u03c6. The continuity of \u03b4\u22121 can be shown similarly.\n\u0003\nAs can be seen from simple examples, \u03b4(U D(G)) is, in general, not closed in M\u221e (G) and\nthe LRT is not the same as the vague topology on \u03b4(U D(G)). For example, if (xn ) is a\nsequence in G with xn \u2212\u2192 0 and xn 6= 0, then, \u039bn := {0, xn } \u2208 U D(G) with \u039bn \u2212\u2192 {0}\nin the LRT. However, \u03b4(\u039bn ) \u2212\u2192 2\u03b40 in the vague topology, and 2\u03b40 does not belong to\n\u03b4(U D(G)). Nevertheless, the following still holds.\nProposition 4. Let V be an open neighbourhood of 0 in G. Then, DV (G) is compact in the\nLRT and \u03b4(DV (G)) is compact in the vague topology.\nProof. By compactness of C(G) and continuity of \u03b4, it suffices to show that DV (G) is closed.\nSince V is open, this is easy.\n\u0003\nOur main result on the relationship of point dynamical systems and the framework of\nmeasure dynamical systems reads as follows.\n\n\f12\n\nMICHAEL BAAKE AND DANIEL LENZ\n\nTheorem 4. If (\u03a9, \u03b1) is a point dynamical system, the restriction \u03b4|\u03a9 : \u03a9 \u2212\u2192 \u03b4(\u03a9) of \u03b4 to\n\u03a9 establishes a topological conjugacy between the dynamical systems (\u03a9, \u03b1) and (\u03b4(\u03a9), \u03b1).\nProof. By Lemma 2, \u03b4|\u03a9 is an injective and continuous map which is compatible with the\ngroup action. As \u03a9 is compact, so is \u03b4(\u03a9). By a standard argument [28, Prop. 1.6.8],\n\u03b4|\u03a9 is then a homeomorphism between (\u03a9, \u03b1) and (\u03b4(\u03a9), \u03b1). Together, this establishes the\ntopological conjugacy.\n\u0003\nWe finish this section by briefly discussing the relationship of the LRT and the topology\nusually considered for Delone dynamical systems with the FLC property. A thorough discussion of the latter topology has been given in [34]. This discussion actually gives a topology\non the closed subsets of G (though this is not explicitly noted in [34]). This topology will be\ncalled the local matching topology (LMT).\nThe definition of the LMT in [34] shows immediately that the LRT is coarser than the\nLMT. Thus, the identity\nid : (C(G), LMT) \u2212\u2192 (C(G), LRT) ,\n\nP 7\u2192 P\n\nis continuous. This yields the following result, which essentially shows that our way of topologising the uniformly discrete sets coincides with the usual topology when restricted to sets\nof finite local complexity.\nProposition 5. Let \u03a9 be a subset of C(G). If \u03a9 is compact in the LMT, then \u03a9 is compact\nin the LRT as well, and the two topologies agree on \u03a9.\nProof. The restriction id\u03a9 : (\u03a9, LMT) \u2212\u2192 (\u03a9, LRT) of the identity to \u03a9 is continuous. Thus,\nas (\u03a9, LMT) is compact, so is its image (\u03a9, LRT). Now, continuity of the inverse is standard,\ncf. [28, Prop. 1.6.8]. Thus, the two topologies agree.\n\u0003\n5. The diffraction spectrum\nThe basic concepts in the mathematical treatment of diffraction experiments are the autocorrelation measure and the diffraction measure. In the context of Delone dynamical systems,\nthese concepts have been developed and investigated in a series of articles by theoretical physicists and mathematicians [3, 5, 11, 17, 18, 33, 34]. This will now be generalized and extended\nto our measure dynamical systems. More precisely, we show the existence of the autocorrelation measure by a limiting procedure, provided certain ergodicity assumptions hold.\nLet us mention that we will provide an alternative approach to these quantities later on.\nIt will be more general in that it does not need an ergodicity assumption.\nTo phrase our results, we need two more pieces of notation. Firstly, recall from [34] that a\nsequence (Bn ) of compact subsets of G is called a van Hove sequence if\n|\u2202 K Bn |\n= 0\nn\u2192\u221e |Bn |\nlim\n\nfor all compact K \u2282 G. Here, for compact B, K, the \"K-boundary\" \u2202 K B of B is defined as\n\u2202 K B := ((B + K) \\ B) \u222a (G \\ B \u2212 K) \u2229 B,\nwhere the bar denotes the closure. The existence of van Hove sequences for all \u03c3-compact\nLCA groups is shown in [34, p. 249], see also Section 3.3 and Theorem (3.L) of [38, Appendix].\nn\u2192\u221e\nMoreover, every van Hove sequence is a F\u00f8lner sequence, i.e., |Bn \u25b3(Bn + K)|/|Bn | \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0,\n\n\fPURE POINT SPECTRUM\n\n13\n\nfor every compact set K \u2282 G, where \u25b3 denotes the operator for the symmetric difference\nof two sets, compare Section 3.2 of [38, Appendix]; for a partial converse, consult Theorem\n(3.K) of the same reference.\nSecondly, for \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G) and \u03bc \u2208 M(G), we define\nZ\n\u0001\n\u03c6(\u2212s) d\u03bc(s).\nf\u03c6 (\u03bc) := \u03c6 \u2217 \u03bc (0) =\nG\n\nThis gives a way to \"push\" functions from Cc (G) to C(\u03a9). In fact, up to the sign, f\u03c6 is just\nthe canonical embedding of Cc (G) into its bidual M(G)\u2217 . Basic features of the map \u03c6 7\u2192 f\u03c6\nare gathered in the following lemma.\nLemma 3. Recall the definition \u03b1t \u03bc = \u03b4t \u2217 \u03bc for measures \u03bc, and set \u03b2t (\u03c6) = \u03b4t \u2217 \u03c6 for\nfunctions \u03c6. Then one has:\n(a) The function f\u03c6 : M(G) \u2212\u2192 C, \u03bc 7\u2192 f\u03c6 (\u03bc) is continuous, for all \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G).\n(b) If (\u03a9, \u03b1) is a TMDS, the map f : Cc (G) \u2212\u2192 C(\u03a9), \u03c6 7\u2192 f\u03c6 , is linear, continuous\nand compatible with the action of G in that f\u03c6 (\u03b1t \u03bc) = f\u03b2t (\u03c6) (\u03bc).\n\nProof. (a) For \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G), we have f\u03c6 (\u03bc) = \u03bc(\u03c6 ), where \u03c6 (t) = \u03c6(\u2212t). Thus, continuity of\nf\u03c6 is immediate from the definition of the topology on M(G).\n(b) Linearity of the map f is obvious. To show continuity of f , recall that Cc (G) is equipped\nwith the inductive limit topology induced from the embeddings CK (G) \u0592\u2192 Cc (G) with K \u2282 G\ncompact. Thus, it suffices to show the continuity of the map\nfK : CK (G) \u0592\u2192 Cc (G) ,\n\n\u03c6 7\u2192 f\u03c6\n\nfor every compact K in G. So, let (\u03c6\u03b9 ) be a net in CK (G) converging to \u03c6 \u2208 CK (G). Then,\nk\u03c6\u03b9 \u2212 \u03c6k\u221e \u2212\u2192 0, and supp(\u03c6), supp(\u03c6\u03b9 ) \u2282 K for all \u03b9. As \u03a9 \u2282 MC,V (G) with suitable C, V ,\nthis easily implies f\u03c6\u03b9 \u2212\u2192 f\u03c6 . Finally, a direct calculation shows f\u03c6 (\u03b1t \u03bc) = f\u03b2t (\u03c6) (\u03bc).\n\u0003\nRemark. The lemma is particularly interesting as there does not seem to exist any canonical\nmap from \u03a9 to G or from G to \u03a9 in our setting (let alone a map which is compatible with\nthe corresponding group actions). However, if one views a function \u03c6 as the Radon-Nikodym\nderivative of a measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to the Haar measure of G,\nthe action \u03b1t induces \u03b2t as defined.\nNow, our result on existence of the autocorrelation function reads as follows.\nTheorem 5. Let \u03b1 be the translation action of G on M\u221e (G) as introduced above.\n(a) If (\u03a9, \u03b1) is a uniquely ergodic TMDS, there exists a translation bounded measure\n\u03b3 on G such that the sequence ( |B1n | \u03c9g\nBn \u2217 \u03c9Bn ) converges, in the vague topology,\nto \u03b3 for every\nvan Hove sequence (Bn ) and every \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9. Moreover, the equation\n\u0001\n\u03c6\ne \u2217 \u03c8 \u2217 \u03b3 (t) = hf\u03c6 , T t f\u03c8 i holds for arbitrary \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 Cc (G) and t \u2208 G.\n(b) Let G have a topology with countable base. Let (\u03a9, \u03b1) be a TMDS with ergodic\nprobability measure m. Then, there exists a translation bounded measure \u03b3 on G such\nthat the sequence ( |B1n | \u03c9g\nBn \u2217 \u03c9Bn ) converges, in the vague topology, to \u03b3 for m-almost\nevery \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9, whenever (Bn ) is a van Hove sequence\n\u0001 along which the Birkhoff ergodic\ntheorem holds. Moreover, the equation \u03c6\ne \u2217 \u03c8 \u2217 \u03b3 (t) = hf\u03c6 , T t f\u03c8 i holds for arbitrary\n\u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 Cc (G) and t \u2208 G.\n\n\f14\n\nMICHAEL BAAKE AND DANIEL LENZ\n\nRemarks. (a) Every LCA group with a countable base of the topology admits a van Hove\nsequence along which the Birkhoff ergodic theorem holds, as follows from recent results of\nLindenstrauss [24], see also Tempelman's monograph [38], in particular its Appendix, for\nbackground material. More precisely, every van Hove sequence is a F\u00f8lner sequence, and thus\ncontains a so-called tempered subsequence with the desired property, compare [24]. Note also\nthat G second countable implies \u03c3-compactness as well as metrisability of G.\n(b) The theorem generalises the corresponding results of [11, 34, 18].\nTo prove Theorem 5, we need some preparation in form of the following results.\nLemma 4. Let D be a dense subset of Cc (G). Let C > 0 and a relatively compact open V\nin G be given. If (\u03bc\u03b9 ) is a net of measures in MC,V (G) such that \u03bc\u03b9 (\u03c6) converges for every\n\u03c6 \u2208 D, then there exists a translation bounded measure \u03bc \u2208 M(G) such that (\u03bc\u03b9 ) converges\nvaguely to \u03bc.\nProof. As D is dense, every \u03bc in M(G) is uniquely determined by its values on D. Thus, all\nconverging subnets of (\u03bc\u03b9 ) have the same limit. As MC,V (G) is compact by Theorem 2, there\nexist converging subnets. Putting this together, we arrive at the desired statement.\n\u0003\nLemma 5. [34, Lemma 1.2] Let \u03bc, \u03bd be translation bounded measures on G and (Bn ) a van\nHove sequence. Then, in the vague topology, limn\u2192\u221e |B1n | (\u03bcBn \u2217 \u03bdBn \u2212 \u03bc \u2217 \u03bdBn ) = 0.\n\u0003\nLemma 6. [34, Lemma 1.1 (2)] Let (Bn ) be a van Hove\nsequence in G and \u03bc a translation\n\u0001\nbounded measure. Then, the sequence |\u03bc|(Bn )/|Bn | is bounded.\n\u0003\n\nProof of Theorem 5. (a) As \u03c9 \u2208 MC,V (G), Lemma 6 and a short calculation give a constant\u0001\nC \u2032 > 0 and and a relatively compact open V \u2032 \u2282 G such that the sequence (\u03c9g\nBn \u2217 \u03c9Bn )/|Bn |\nis contained in MC \u2032 ,V \u2032 . Moreover, the set {\u03c6 \u2217 \u03c8 : \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 Cc (G)} is dense in Cc (G) by\nstandard arguments involving approximate units\n\u0001 [32].

As the details\nare somewhat more involved than in the case of Delone sets,\n\u0001 we include a sketch for the\nconvenience of the reader.

This can easily be seen by going through a proof of this theorem as presented, e.g., in\n[39, Thm. 6.19].)\n(b) This can be seen similarly: After replacing the pointwise ergodic theorem for uniquely\nergodic systems by the Birkhoff ergodic theorem, the considerations of (a) can be carried\nthrough to show that, for each function \u03c6\ne \u2217 \u03c8, there exists a set \u03a9\u03c6,\u03c8 \u2282 \u03a9 of full measure\nsuch that\n\u0001\n1\nn\u2192\u221e\n\u03c6\ne \u2217 \u03c8 \u2217 \u03c9g\nBn \u2217 \u03c9Bn (0) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 hf\u03c6 , f\u03c8 i\n|Bn |\nfor every \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9\u03c6,\u03c8 .

I.4], its Fourier transform is then a positive measure on G,\ndiffraction measure of \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9. We will have to say more about autocorrelation and diffraction\nmeasures in the next section.\n6. Relating diffraction and dynamical spectrum\nIn this section, we show that the diffraction spectrum is equivalent to the spectrum of\na certain subrepresentation of T . This type of result is implicit in essentially every work\nusing the so-called Dworkin argument [11, 17, 34, 36]. However, it seems worthwhile to make\nthis connection explicit. In fact, this is one of the two cornerstones of our approach to the\ncharacterisation of pure pointedness, the other being Theorem 1. A key ingredient in our\nconsiderations will be Proposition 7 below.\nWe start by giving a closed formula for the autocorrelation measure. This closed formula\ndoes not rely on any ergodicity assumptions. Thus, via this formula, an autocorrelation\nmeasure can be attached to any TMDS with an invariant probability measure m. We should\nlike to mention that this is inspired by recent work of Gou\u00e9r\u00e9 [15], who gives a closed formula\nin the context of Palm measures and point processes.\nProposition 6. Let (\u03a9, \u03b1)\nR be a TMDS with invariant probability measure m. Let a function\n\u03c3 \u2208 Cc (G) be given with G \u03c3(t) dt = 1. For \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G), define\nZ Z\nf\u03c6 (\u03b1\u2212t \u03c9)\u03c3(t) d\u03c9(t) dm(\u03c9).\n\u03b3\u03c3,m (\u03c6) :=\n\u03a9\n\nG\n\nThis leads to the following assertions.\n(a) The map \u03b3\u03c3,m : Cc (G) \u2212\u2192 C is continuous, i.e., \u03b3\u03c3,m \u2208 M(G).\n\u0001\n(b) For \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 Cc (G), the equation \u03c6\ne \u2217 \u03c8 \u2217 \u03b3\u03c3,m (t) = hf\u03c6 , T t f\u03c8Ri holds.\n(c) The measure \u03b3\u03c3,m does not depend on \u03c3 \u2208 Cc (G), provided G \u03c3 dt = 1.\n(d) The measure \u03b3\u03c3,m is positive definite.\n\nProof. Note that f\u03c6 (\u03b1s \u03c9) = f\u03c6 (\u03b1s (\u03c9)).\n(a) Obviously, |f\u03c6 (\u03c9)| \u2264 k\u03c6k\u221e sup {|\u03c9|(t + supp(\u03c6)) : t \u2208 G}. As \u03c3 has compact support,\n\u03b3\u03c3,m (\u03c6) is then finite. Moreover, \u03c6\u03b9 \u2212\u2192 \u03c6 implies \u03c6\u03b9 \u2212\u2192 \u03c6 which, in turn, yields f\u03c6\u03b9 \u2212\u2192 f\u03c6\nby continuity of f .

Part (d) shows that \u03b3\u03c3,m is\npositive definite. Thus, by Bochner's Theorem, see [7], its Fourier transform is a positive\nb\nmeasure on the dual group G.\n\nDefinition 6. Let (\u03a9, \u03b1) be a TMDS\nR with invariant probability measure m. The measure\n\u03b3m := \u03b3\u03c3,m , where \u03c3 \u2208 Cc (G) with G \u03c3 dt = 1, is called the autocorrelation measure of the\ndynamical system (\u03a9, \u03b1) with invariant measure m. Its Fourier transform \u03b3c\nm is called the\ndiffraction measure of the dynamical system (\u03a9, \u03b1) with invariant measure m.\nWe summarise the preceding considerations in the following lemma, where we use \u03c8 for\nthe function defined by \u03c8 (t) = \u03c8(\u2212t).\n\nLemma 7. Let (\u03a9, \u03b1) be a TMDS with invariant probability measure m. Then, there exists\na unique measure on G assigning the value hf\u03c6 , f\u03c8 i to the function \u03c6 \u2217 \u03c8 , for \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 Cc (G).\nThis measure is the autocorrelation measure \u03b3m of (\u03a9, \u03b1).\n\n\f18\n\nMICHAEL BAAKE AND DANIEL LENZ\n\nProof. Uniqueness is clear as the set {\u03c6 \u2217 \u03c8 : \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 Cc (G)} is dense in Cc (G). Existence\nfollows from Proposition 6, as\n\u0001\ne \u2217 \u03c8 \u2217 \u03b3m (0) = hf\u03c6 , f\u03c8 i.\n\u03b3m (\u03c6 \u2217 \u03c8 ) = \u03c6\nThis proves the lemma.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark. This definition of the autocorrelation and the diffraction of a dynamical system\nis to be compared with the corresponding objects of a single measure (namely an element in\n\u03a9) studied in the last section. In the latter case, one faces the problem of its dependence of\nthe measure m, or of the averaging sequence (Bn ). It is reasonable, both mathematically and\nphysically, to replace this by the objects defined in Definition 6, at least for most aspects of\nthe spectral theory connected with it.\nHaving cast the diffraction measure in an abstract context, we will now briefly discuss the\nbasic quantities in the spectral theory of dynamical systems: Let (\u03a9, \u03b1) be a TMDS. By\nStone's Theorem (compare [25, Sec. 36D]), there exists a projection valued measure\nb \u2212\u2192 Projections on L2 (\u03a9, m)\nET : Borel sets on G\nwith\n\nhf, T t f i =\n\nZ\n\nb\nG\n\n(b\ns, t) dhf, ET (b\ns)f i =\n\nZ\n\nb\nG\n\n(b\ns, t) d\u03c1f (b\ns) ,\n\nb defined by \u03c1 (B) := hf, ET (B)f i. It is then not hard to see that\nwhere \u03c1f is the measure on G\nf\nT has pure point spectrum (in the sense defined in Section 2) if and only if all the measures\n\u03c1f , with f \u2208 L2 (\u03a9, m), are pure point measures.\nTo \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G), we have associated the function f\u03c6 \u2208 L2 (\u03a9, m) in the last section. It turns\nout that the measure \u03c1f\u03c6 can be calculated in terms of the diffraction measure. While this\nconnection is not hard to prove, it is underlying the main result of this section. Therefore,\nwe isolate it in the following proposition (compare [7, 14]).\nProposition 7. Let (\u03a9, \u03b1) be a TMDS with invariant probability measure m. Then, the\nequation \u03c1f\u03c6 = |\u03c6|\nb 2 \u03b3c\nm holds for every \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G).\n\nb of \u03c1 is\nProof. By the very definition of \u03c1f\u03c6 above, the (inverse) Fourier transform (on G)\nf\u03c6\n\u0001\nt 7\u2192 hf\u03c6 , T t f\u03c6 i. By Lemma 6, we have hf\u03c6 , T t f\u03c6 i = \u03c6\ne \u2217 \u03c6 \u2217 \u03b3m (t). Thus, taking the Fourier\nb 2 \u03b3c\n\u0003\ntransform (on G), we infer \u03c1f\u03c6 = |\u03c6|\nm.\n\nNote that every closed T -invariant subspace V of L2 (\u03a9, m) gives rise to a representation\nT |V of G on V by restricting the representation T to V. The spectral family of T |V will\nbe denoted by ET |V . With the canonical inclusion iV : V \u2212\u2192 L2 (\u03a9, m) and projection\nPV : L2 (\u03a9, m) \u2212\u2192 V, we obviously have\nT |V = PV T iV\n\nand\n\nET |V = PV ET iV .\n\nIn our setting, a translation invariant subspace appears naturally. This is discussed next.\nLemma 8. Let (\u03a9, \u03b1) be a TMDS with invariant probability measure m. The set of functions\nU0 := {f\u03c6 : \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G)} is a translation invariant subspace of L2 (\u03a9, m), and so is its closure.\nProof. The first part of the statement follows from Lemma 3 (b). The second part of the\nstatement is then immediate.\n\u0003\n\n\fPURE POINT SPECTRUM\n\n19\n\nDefinition 7. Let U be the closure of the space U0 from Lemma 8 in L2 (\u03a9, m).\nBefore we can give a precise version of the relationship between \u03b3c\nm and T we need one\nmore definition.\n\nb and S be an arbitrary unitary representation of G\nDefinition 8. Let \u03c1 be a measure on G\n2\non L (\u03a9, m). Then, \u03c1 is called a spectral measure for S if the following holds for all Borel\nsets B: ES (B) = 0 if and only if \u03c1(B) = 0.\nNow, the relationship between \u03b3c\nm and T = Tm can be phrased as follows.\n\nTheorem 6. Let (\u03a9, \u03b1) be a TMDS with invariant probability measure m. Then, the measure\n\u03b3c\nm is a spectral measure for the restriction T | U of T to U .\n\nb Then, obviously, ET | (B) = 0 if and only if we have\nProof. Let B be a Borel set in G.\nU\n0 = hf\u03c6 , ET | U (B)f\u03c6 i for every \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G). As hf\u03c6 , ET (B)f\u03c6 i = hf\u03c6 , ET | U (B)f\u03c6 i for every\n\u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G), by the very definition of U and ET | U , we infer that ET | U (B) = 0 if and only if\nhf\u03c6 , ET (B)f\u03c6 i = 0 ,\n\nBy Proposition 7, we have \u03c1f\u03c6 =\n\nfor every \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G) .\n\n|\u03c6|\nb 2 \u03b3c\nm\n\nand, in particular,\nZ\n|\u03c6|\nb 2 d\u03b3c\nhf\u03c6 , ET (B)f\u03c6 i = \u03c1f\u03c6 (B) =\nm.\nB\nR\nThese considerations show that ET | U (B) = 0 if and only if 0 = B |\u03c6|\nb 2 d\u03b3c\nfunction\nm for every\nR\n\u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G).

We thank the referee for useful comments on this point.\nThe following is a consequence of Proposition 7 (compare [5, Prop. 3] and discussion preceding it for similar considerations).\nCorollary 1. Let (\u03c6\u03b9 ) be an approximate unit in Cc (G) with respect to convolution, i.e.,\n\u03c6\u03b9 \u2217 \u03c8 \u2212\u2192 \u03c8 in Cc (G) for every \u03c8 \u2208 Cc (G). Then, the measures \u03c1f\u03c6\u03b9 converge vaguely to \u03b3c\nm.\n\nProof. As (\u03c6\u03b9 ) is an approximate unit in Cc (G), the continuous functions \u03c6\u03b9 \u2217 \u03c6e\u03b9 , viewed as\nabsolutely continuous measures with respect to the Haar measure on G, converge vaguely\ntowards \u03b40 , the unit point measure at 0 \u2208 G. Thus, Levy's continuity theorem [7, Thm 3.13]\ngives us compact convergence of |\u03c6b\u03b9 |2 towards \u03b4b0 \u2261 1. This easily implies vague convergence of\nb 2 \u03b3c\nthe measures |\u03c6b\u03b9 |2 \u03b3c\nc\nm by Proposition 7, we infer the statement\nm towards \u03b3\nm .

The result is unique, once m is chosen.\n\n\f20\n\nMICHAEL BAAKE AND DANIEL LENZ\n\n7. The main result\nIn this section, we state and prove our main result. It shows equivalence of pure point\ndiffraction and pure point dynamical spectrum for rather general measure theoretic dynamical\nsystems.\nTheorem 7. Let (\u03a9, \u03b1) be a TMDS with invariant probability measure m. Let Tm be the associated unitary representation of G by translation operators and \u03b3c\nm the associated diffraction\nmeasure. The following assertions are now equivalent.\n(a) The diffraction measure \u03b3c\nm is pure point.\n(b) The representation Tm has pure point spectrum.\nProof of Theorem 7. (a) =\u21d2 (b). This is a consequence of Theorem 1. More precisely, we\nwill show that the vector space\nV := {f\u03c6 : \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G)}\nsatisfies assertion (b) of this theorem:\nAs \u03b3c\nm has pure point spectrum by (a), Theorem 6 gives that T | U has pure point spectrum,\nwhere U is the closure of V. Thus, in particular, f\u03c6 belongs to Hpp (T ) for every \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G).\nAs every element of the form f\u03c6 is continuous by Lemma 3, we see that V is indeed a subspace\nof Hpp (T ) \u2229 C(\u03a9).\nIt remains to be shown that V separates points. Let \u03c91 and \u03c92 be two different points of\n\u03a9. Then, \u03c91 and \u03c92 are different measures on G. Therefore, there exists a \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G) with\n\u03c91 (\u03c6) 6= \u03c92 (\u03c6). This implies f\u03c6 (\u03c91 ) 6= f\u03c6 (\u03c92 ) with \u03c6 (t) := \u03c6(\u2212t).\n(b) =\u21d2 (a). This is immediate from Theorem 6.\n\n\u0003\n\n8. Spectral properties determined by subrepresentations\nThe ideas of the preceding sections can be refined to give some further information on\nhow spectral properties of T are determined by spectral properties of T U . This concerns\nthe continuity of the eigenfunctions, and the set of eigenvalues. While the TMDS are the\napplication we have in mind here, the underlying result can be phrased rather abstractly.\nWe need a special concept on \"density of a subspace with respect to multiplication\".

A subspace V of L2 (\u03a9, m) is said to satisfy condition MD if the set of products\nf1 * . . . * fn with n \u2208 N, fi \u2208 V \u2229 L\u221e (\u03a9, m) or fi \u2208 V \u2229 L\u221e (\u03a9, m), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, is total in\nL2 (\u03a9, m).\nTheorem 8. Let (\u03a9, \u03b1) be a topological dynamical system over G with \u03b1-invariant measure\nm. Let V be a closed T -invariant subspace of L2 (\u03a9, m) satisfying MD. If T |V has pure point\nspectrum, then the following assertions hold:\n(a) T has pure point spectrum.\n(b) The group of eigenvalues of T is generated by the set of eigenvalues of T |V .\n(c) If V has a basis consisting of continuous eigenfunctions of T |V , then L2 (\u03a9, m) has\na basis consisting of continuous eigenfunctions of T , provided the multiplicity of each\neigenvalue of T is at most countably infinite.\n\n\fPURE POINT SPECTRUM\n\n21\n\nRemarks. (a) The countability assumption in (c) is trivially satisfied if the Hilbert space\nL2 (\u03a9, m) is separable, (which holds, e.g., if \u03a9 is metrisable). It is also satisfied if \u03b1 is ergodic\nwith respect to m. In this case, the multiplicity of each eigenvalue is one.\n(b) While we have stated the theorem for topological dynamical systems, its proof does not use\nthe topology on \u03a9. It can therefore be carried over without changes to give the corresponding\nresult for measurable actions of G on a measure space \u03a9.\nProof. (a)/(b) Let S1 be an orthonormal basis of V consisting of eigenfunctions of T |V . Set\nS2 := {f N : f \u2208 S1 or f \u2208 S1 , N \u2208 N},\nwhere, for N \u2208 N and a function f , the function f N is defined in (2). As mentioned there,\nf N is again an eigenfunction of T . However, f N need not belong to V. Let S3 be the set of\nfinite products of elements of S2 . In particular, all elements of S3 are bounded functions, and\nthe same is true of all finite linear combinations of elements of S3 .\nClaim. Every finite product f1 * . . . * fn with n \u2208 N, and fi or fi in V \u2229 L\u221e (\u03a9, m), can be\napproximated arbitrarily well (in L2 (\u03a9, m)) by finite linear combinations of elements of S3 .\nProof of the Claim. This is shown by induction. The case n = 1 is simple, as S1 is an\northonormal basis of V. Assume that the claim holds for fixed n \u2208 N. As in Lemma 1, we\nuse again a variant of Lee, Moody and Solomyak [22]. Let \u03b5 > 0 be given. By the induction\nassumption, there exists a finite linear combination g of elements of S3 with\n\u03b5\nkf1 * . . . * fn \u2212 gk2 \u2264\n.\nkfn+1 k\nHere, g is a bounded function (as all functions in S3 are bounded). Thus, there exists a finite\nlinear combination h of elements in S3 with\n\u03b5\n.\nkfn+1 \u2212 hk2 \u2264\nkgk\u221e\nThe proof of the claim can now be finished as in Lemma 1.\n\u0003\n2\nThe claim shows that S3 is total in L (\u03a9, m), as the products appearing in its statement\nare total in L2 (\u03a9, m) by the density assumption MD. Now, obviously, the elements of S3 are\neigenfunctions of T and the corresponding eigenvalues are just the group generated by the\neigenvalues of T |V . This proves (a) and (b).\nTo prove (c), we consider a basis S1 of V consisting of continuous eigenfunctions of T |V\nand define\nS4 := {f1 * . . . * fn : n \u2208 N, fi \u2208 S1 or fi \u2208 S1 } .\nAs above, one can show that S4 is total in L2 (\u03a9, m). Apparently, the elements in S4 are\ncontinuous eigenfunctions of T . Moreover, by general principles, eigenfunctions belonging to\ndifferent eigenvalues are orthogonal. We now apply the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation procedure in each eigenspace, compare [28, Sec. 3.1.13]. This is possible because the multiplicity\nof each eigenspace is at most countably infinite by (c). As a result, we obtain a basis of\neigenfunctions which are continuous. (Note that Gram-Schmidt deals only with finite sums\nin each step and therefore does not destroy continuity. )\n\u0003\nThe preceding considerations can be applied to any TMDS. This will briefly be discussed\nnext. To apply Theorem 8, we need the following reformulation of previous results.\n\n\f22\n\nMICHAEL BAAKE AND DANIEL LENZ\n\nProposition 8. Let (\u03a9, \u03b1) be a TMDS with invariant probability measure m, let U be the\nspace introduced in Definition 7 and denote the characteristic function of \u03a9 by 1\u03a9 . Then,\nthe subspace V := U + {c 1\u03a9 : c \u2208 C} is closed, invariant and satisfies assumption MD.\nProof. The subspace S := {c 1\u03a9 : c \u2208 C} is one-dimensional. So, as U is closed, V = U + S\nis closed as well. As U and S are T -invariant, so is V. It remains to be shown that MD\nis satisfied. This is a consequence of the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem as {f\u03c6 : \u03c6 \u2208 Cc (G)}\nseparates points (see the proof of Theorem 7).\n\u0003\nIt is possible to base the proof of our main result, Theorem 7, on Theorem 8 and Proposition 8. Here, our focus is in a somewhat different direction.\nTheorem 9. Let (\u03a9, \u03b1) be a TMDS with invariant probability measure m, Tm be the corresponding unitary representation of G by translation operators, and \u03b3c\nm the associated diffraction measure. Let U be the space of functions defined in Definition 7. If \u03b3c\nm is a pure point\nmeasure, the following assertions hold.\nb of positive \u03b3c\n(a) The group of eigenvalues of Tm is generated by the set of points in G\nm\nmeasure, i.e., the points \u015d with \u03b3c\nm ({\u015d}) > 0.\n(b) If U has a basis of continuous eigenfunctions of Tm , then so has L2 (\u03a9, m), provided\nthe multiplicity of each eigenvalue is at most countably infinite.\nProof. As \u03b3c\nm is a pure point measure, T | U has pure point spectrum by Theorem 6. Set\nV := U + {c 1\u03a9 : c \u2208 C}. As 1\u03a9 is obviously a (continuous) eigenfunction of T (to the\neigenvalue 1), TV has pure point spectrum as well. Moreover, by Proposition 8, V is invariant,\nclosed and satisfies assumption MD. Thus, the conditions of Theorem 8 are satisfied, and our\nassertions follow.\n\u0003\nAcknowledgements. It is our pleasure to thank Robert V. Moody and Peter Stollmann for\ntheir cooperation.

The local rubber topology is a Fell topology\nThe aim of this appendix is to show that the topology introduced in Section 4 is a special\ncase of a topology introduced by Fell in [13] on the closed subsets of an arbitrary locally\ncompact space.\nWe start by recalling the definition of Fell's topology: The locally compact space in question\nis G. For a compact set C in G and a finite family F of open sets in G, we define U (C, F) by\nU (C, F) : {C \u2208 C(G) : \u039b \u2229 C = \u2205 and \u039b \u2229 A 6= \u2205 for every A \u2208 F}.\nThe family of all U (C, F) with C compact in G and F a finite family of open sets in G is a\nbasis of the Fell topology. This is a typical example of a so-called \"hit and miss\" topology,\nwhere U (C, F) consists of all closed sets which hit the sets of F and miss the set C.\nThis topology agrees with the one introduced in Section 4, as follows from the next lemma.\n\n\fPURE POINT SPECTRUM\n\n23\n\nLemma 9. (a) Let C \u2282 G compact and F a finite family of open subsets of G be given\nwith U (C, F) 6= \u2205. Then, there exists a closed set H in G, a compact K \u2282 G and an open\nneighbourhood V of 0 \u2208 G with\nUK,V (H) \u2282 U (C, F).\n(b) Let a closed set H in G, a compact subset K \u2282 G and an open neighbourhood V of 0 \u2208 G\nbe given. Then, there exists a compact C \u2282 G and a finite family of open sets F in G with\nU (C, F) 6= \u2205 and\nU (C, F) \u2282 UK,V (H).\nProof. (a) By U (C, F) 6= \u2205, we have A \\ C 6= \u2205 for every A \u2208 F. Thus, in every A \u2208 F there\nexists an xA \u2208 A \\ C. As A \\ C is open and F is a finite family, we can find a neighbourhood\nV of 0 in G with V = \u2212V such that\n(6)\n\nxA + V \u2282 A \\ C\n\nfor every A \u2208 F .\n\nDefine H := {xA : A \u2208 F} and K := C \u222a (H + V ). Then, K is the disjoint union of C and\nH + V by the very construction of H.\nNow, let an arbitrary L \u2208 UK,V (H) be given. We have to show that L \u2208 U (C, F):\nBy L \u2208 UK,V (H), we have L \u2229 K \u2282 H + V \u2282 H + V \u2282 K \\ C and, as C \u2282 K, this implies\nL \u2229 C = L \u2229 C \u2229 K = \u2205.\nMoreover, for every A \u2208 F, we have xA \u2208 H = H \u2229K \u2282 L+V and therefore (xA \u2212V )\u2229L 6= \u2205.\nBy V = \u2212V and (6), this implies\n\u2205 6= (xA + V ) \u2229 L \u2282 (A \\ C) \u2229 L \u2282 A \u2229 L\nfor every A \u2208 F. These considerations show L \u2208 U (C, F). As L \u2208 UK,V (H) was arbitrary,\nwe infer UK,V (H) \u2282 U (C, F).\n(b) Let W be an open neighbourhood of 0 in G with W = \u2212W and W + W \u2282 V . Define\nC := K \\ (H + W ), where H and K are given by assumption. As K \u2229 H is compact, there\nexist t1 , . . . , tn \u2208 G with\nn\n[\n(ti + W ) and (tj + W ) \u2229 (K \u2229 H) 6= \u2205 for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n.\n(7)\nK \u2229H \u2282\ni=1\n\nSet F := {tj + W : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n}.\nLet now L \u2208 U (C, F) be arbitrary. We have to show that L \u2208 UK,V (H):\nBy L \u2208 U (C, F) and the definition of C, we have \u2205 = L \u2229 C = L \u2229 (K \\ (H + W )), so\n\nL \u2229 K = L \u2229 (K \u2229 (H + W )) \u222a L \u2229 (K \\ (H + W )) = L \u2229 (K \u2229 (H + W )) \u2282 H + W \u2282 H + V.\nBy L \u2229 (tj + W ) 6= \u2205, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, and W \u2212 W \u2282 V , we also have tj + W \u2282 L + V . Combined\nwith (7), this implies\nn\n[\n(tj + W ) \u2282 L + V\nH \u2229K \u2282\nj=1\n\nand we infer L \u2208 UK,V (H). As L \u2208 U (C, F) was arbitrary, the inclusion U (C, F) \u2282 UK,V (H)\nis established. Moreover, U (C, F) is not empty, as it obviously contains H.\n\u0003\n\n\f24\n\nMICHAEL BAAKE AND DANIEL LENZ\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
