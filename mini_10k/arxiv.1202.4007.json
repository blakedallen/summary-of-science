I NTRODUCTION\nThe last two decades have seen an explosive growth in the financial derivatives market. Indeed, according\nto [5], the notional size of the over-the-counter derivatives market increased from $94 trillion in June of\n2000, to $707 trillion as of June of 2012. Similarly, U.S. issuance of mortgage backed securities ([41])\nincreased from $496 billion to $3.2 trillion between 1996 and 2003 before reverting back to $1.7 trillion in\n2011. Due to their complexity, these contracts are often neither easily traded nor hedged. The purpose of this\narticle is to identify a means for pricing such instruments which takes into account market incompleteness,\ninvestor risk aversion, and most importantly, the large position size. In particular, it is sought to identify\nwhich aspects of the market and the investor are the primary drivers of prices.\nLet q denote the position size in a derivative contract which the investor holds, but may not trade. The\ngoal is to study the (average bid) utility indifference price p = pU (x, q) in the limit that q \u2192 \u221e. Here, U is\nthe investor's utility function and x is the initial capital. p is defined through the balance equation\n(1.1)\n\nuU (x \u2212 qp, q) = uU (x, 0),\n\nwhere, given (x, q), the value function uU (x, q) represents the optimal utility an investor may achieve by\ntrading in the underlying market. The idea behind indifference pricing traces back to [24] and the topic\nhas been extensively studied : see [9] for a comprehensive review. Clearly, to compute p, knowledge of\nthe value function uU is crucial. However, except for a few special utility functions and models, uU is not\nDate: November 20, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 91B28, 60G44, 91B16.\nKey words and phrases.

This presents the primary challenge to obtaining indifference prices and motivates the\nstudy of their approximation.\nOne approximation occurs in the small claim limit (i.e. as |q| \u2193 0). Here, [12, 13] obtain first order\napproximations in a Brownian setting, while [3, 38, 37, 28, 32, 4] obtain asymptotic results, regarding both\npricing and hedging strategies, for the exponential utility (as well as for general utilities on the real line\nin [37, 4]) in varying degrees of generality. In [31], small claim approximations are obtained for utilities\ndefined on the positive axis. A key feature present in all these articles is that the market is kept constant as\nthe claim size becomes small. Also, almost by construction, this approximation is not appropriate for large\ninvestors.\nA second approximation occurs by taking a sequence of markets which is becoming complete in some\nsense. In [13], asymptotics are provided in a basis-risk model as the correlation parameter between the\nhedgeable and unhedgeable shocks approaches one (this case is treated in detail in Section 5). [29] obtains\nresults in a Brownian setting in the case of both fixed and vanishing portfolio constraints. A key feature of\nthese papers is that as the market changes, the claim size remains fixed.\nIn contrast to the above asymptotics, for large positions is desirable to allow both the position size and\nmarket to vary. This follows by considering the relationship between owning and hedging a claim. Indeed,\nas shown in Section 5, in a Brownian setting with exponential utility, given the opportunity to purchase\nclaims for an arbitrage free price, the optimal position size to take (see [25, 42]) satisfies the heuristic\nrelationship\n(1.2)\n\nrisk aversion \u00d7 position size \u00d7 hedging error \u2248 constant.\n\nThus, for a fixed risk aversion, large position sizes arise in conjunction with vanishing hedging errors, and\nhence the market should be allowed to vary. In fact, through the lens of (1.2), large claim analysis can\nbe thought of as treating the regime where position size \u00d7 hedging error \u2248 constant, as opposed to the\nsmall claim or asymptotically complete limits where position size \u00d7 hedging error \u2248 0. Given the notional\namounts outstanding, the former regime is entirely consistent with markets where hedging errors are nearly\nnegligible.\nUsing the above as motivation, for a given sequence of markets Mn , claims hn , and respective position\nsizes qn , the \"large claim limit\" is defined through two requirements. First (clearly), that qn \u2192 \u221e. Second,\nthat asymptotically the Mn do not permit arbitrage. Note that this certainly includes the regime when\nadditionally, (1.2) holds but does not require it. For a fixed market, it is shown in [37] that no arbitrage is\nequivalent to unU (x, 0) < U (\u221e), where unU (x, 0) is the value function in the nth market when no claims\nare held. As n \u2191 \u221e, the analogous statement is lim supn\u2191\u221e unU (x, 0) < U (\u221e). This is enforced in\nAssumptions 3.2 and 4.2 : see Remark 3.3 and Proposition 6.1. The idea is that for limiting prices to have\nany meaning, the sequence of markets asymptotically should not allow for risk-less profit.\nTo avoid cumbersome admissibility restrictions, the claims hn are assumed to be uniformly bounded and\nutility functions U on the whole real line are considered. The main results of the paper, Theorem 3.4 and\n\n\fLARGE POSITION PRICING\n\n3\n\nProposition 4.3 state that the decay of U for large negative wealths is the primary investor-specific determinant of the limiting indifference price. For exponential decay, Theorem 3.4 shows prices come together for\nall utilities U with the same rate of decay. This theorem has the simple, practical message that an investor\nwith utility function U should ascertain if there is some \u03b1 > 0 such that limx\u2193\u2212\u221e \u2212(1/x) log(\u2212U (x)) = \u03b1\n(see Examples 2.5 and 2.6 for two important, non exponential utilities), and if so, price like an exponential\ninvestor with risk aversion \u03b1. Furthermore, under the additional restriction that log(U (x)/(\u2212e\u2212\u03b1x )) remains bounded as x \u2193 \u2212\u221e (see Definition 3.7) Theorem 3.9 shows that the total monetary error incurred by\napproximating via exponential prices remains bounded, providing a rate of how fast prices come together.\nFor utilities with power-like decay the situation is more complicated. Here, U is assumed to satisfy\nlimx\u2193\u2212\u221e \u2212U (x)/(\u2212x)p = 1/l for some p > 1, l > 0. Proposition 4.3 shows that prices do come together\nfor all such U , but only after the position size qn has been suitably altered to (\u2212unU (x, 0))1/p qn . Even though\nthis implies that prices will typically not come together for the non-adjusted sizes qn , Proposition 4.3 still\nallows for prices to be computed using the more manageable utility function Up (x) = \u2212(1/p)(\u2212x)p , x \u2248\n\u2212\u221e (more precisely, for the convex conjugate function Vp (y) = ((p \u2212 1)/p)y p/(p\u22121) : see equations (3.1)\nand (4.1)).\nIn addition to the over-the-counter derivatives market, large claim limit pricing has applications to the\ninsurance industry. [6] considers large positions pricing for liabilities with both financial and insurancial\nrisks, such as revenue insurance contracts or mortality derivatives. Here, the claim is actually the sum of the\ncontracts. The crucial assumption in [6] is that the large claim limit naturally arises, not in conjuction with\nvanishing hedging error, but rather with vanishing absolute risk aversion, as can be deduced by (1.2).\nThis paper is organized as follows : Section 2 introduces the general setup for both the models and the\nfamily of utility functions, in the exponential decay case. Section 3 gives the main results for the exponential\ndecay case, as well as providing examples to highlight the minimality of the given assumptions. Section 4\ngives the corresponding results for the power decay case. Using [43], which identifies the value function\nfor an exponential investor, Section 5 computes limiting prices and monetary errors in a class of stochastic\nvolatility, or basis risk, models. Proposition 5.3 shows there are essentially three limiting indifference\nprices, depending upon the rate at which qn becomes large. As will be discussed, this trichotomy of limiting\nprices appears to be general feature of large claim analysis, and is intimately related to the theory of Large\nDeviations. Section 5 also motivates the relationship in (1.2), discussing its validity from an equilibrium\nstandpoint using the notion of partial equilibrium price quantities introduced in [1]. Section 5 concludes by\nshowing that asymptotic market completeness is best defined through the primal lens of vanishing hedging\nerrors, rather than the dual lens of collapsing families of martingale measures. Sections 6, 7 and Appendix\nA contain the proofs.\n2. S ETUP\n2.1. Assets and Martingale Measures. Let T > 0 denote the horizon.

The risky asset S n = (S1n , . . . , Sdnn ) is a locally bounded, Rdn -valued semi-martingale.\nIn addition to being able to trade in S n , the investor owns qn units of a non-tradable, F n measurable,\ncontingent claim hn .\nFor n \u2208 N, denote by Mn the set of probability measures Qn \u226a Pn on F n such that S n is a local\nmartingale under Qn . Recall that for any \u03bc \u226a Pn on F n the relative entropy of \u03bc with respect to Pn is\nn\n\ngiven by H (\u03bc | Pn ) := EP [(d\u03bc/dPn ) log (d\u03bc/dPn ))].

When hn = h(YT ) for a function h on\nthe state space of Y , these are alternatively called \"basis-risk\" models. For exponential utility, utility-based\npricing has been extensively studied : see [23, 12, 43, 35, 21, 22, 9, 34] amongst others. Large claim pricing\nresults for this class of models is given in Section 5. When hn = h(YT , STn ) see [26, 9] for utility-based\npricing results which are based on Partial Differential Equation methods.\nExample 2.3 (Large Markets). Consider, as in [14], when the claim is written on a large market consisting\nof infinitely many assets, but the investor is restricted to trading in the only the first n assets.

Pricing results for this latter case are briefly discussed in Section 5.2.\n2.2. Utility Functions. Throughout the article, a utility function will denote any strictly increasing, strictly\nconcave function U \u2208 C 2 (R). The following class is of particular importance:\nDefinition 2.4. For \u03b1 > 0, denote by U\u03b1 the set of utility functions satisfying limx\u2191\u221e U (x) = 0 and\n(2.3)\n\n1\nlim \u2212 log (\u2212U (x)) = \u03b1.\nx\n\nx\u2193\u2212\u221e\n\nThe canonical example of U \u2208 U\u03b1 is the exponential utility U\u03b1 :\n1\n(2.4)\nU\u03b1 (x) := \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1x .\n\u03b1\nHowever, U\u03b1 is a richer class of utility functions, as the following examples show.\n\n\fLARGE POSITION PRICING\n\n5\n\nExample 2.5 (Fund Manager). Consider the case of several investors with respective utilities Uj \u2208 U\u03b1j , \u03b1j >\n0 for j = 1, . . . , J. As is typically done in target date retirement funds, assume these investors pool their\nwealths into a common fund and delegate a manager to invest the sum. The manager's utility function\nPJ\nJ\nthen takes the form U (x) :=\nj=1 wj Uj (x), where {wj }j=1 are the respective weights of each individual\ninvestor. It readily follows that U \u2208 U\u03b1 for \u03b1 := maxj=1,...,J \u03b1j .\n\nExample 2.6 (Representative Market Maker). This example concerns the representative market maker from\nequilibrium theory, which dates back to [36] and has been extensively studied : see [30, 11, 17, 2] amongst\nothers.

The Value Function and Utility Indifference Price. Let n \u2208 N. A trading strategy H n is admissible\nif it is predictable, S n integrable under Pn , and such that the gains process (H n * S n ) remains above a\nconstant a (which may depend upon H n ) almost surely on [0, T ]. Denote by Hn the set of admissible\ntrading strategies. Now, let \u03b1 > 0 and U \u2208 U\u03b1 . For x, q \u2208 R, the value function unU (x, q; hn ) is defined by\n(2.10)\n\nn\n\nunU (x, q; hn ) := sup EP [U (x + (H n * S n )T + qhn )] .\nH n \u2208Hn\n\n\f6\n\nLARGE POSITION PRICING\n\nNote that n appears in two places. The superscript n outside the parentheses accounts for the dependence\nof S n and Hn upon n. The n in hn represents the fact that the claim may be changing with n. In the case\nwhere hn \u2261 0, set\nunU (x) := unU (x, q; 0).\n\n(2.11)\n\nDefine the average utility indifference (bid) price pnU (x, q; hn ) implicitly as the solution to the equation\nunU (x) = unU (x \u2212 qpnU (x, q; hn ), q; hn ).\n\n(2.12)\n\nThus, pnU (x, q; hn ) is the amount an investor would pay per unit of hn so as to be indifferent between owning\nand not owning q units of the claim.\nRemark 2.7. For the exponential utility U\u03b1 it is well known that the indifference price does not depend upon\nthe initial capital (see [32]). Thus, write pnU\u03b1 (q; hn ) for pnU\u03b1 (x, q; hn ).\n\n3. I NDIFFERENCE P RICES\n\nIN THE\n\nL ARGE C LAIM L IMIT\n\npnU (x, qn ; hn ) is now studied in the limit that qn \u2192 \u221e. Proofs of all assertions made herein are given\nin Section 6. The main result states that for any x1 , x2 \u2208 R and U1 , U2 \u2208 U\u03b1 , as qn \u2192 \u221e the difference\nbetween pnU1 (x1 , qn ; hn ) and pnU2 (x2 , qn ; hn ) vanishes. The intuition for this result is gained by inspecting\nthe indifference pricing formula obtained in [37, Proposition 7.2 (vi)], which is valid in the current setup:\n(3.1)\n\npnU (x, qn ; hn )\n\n=\n\ninf\n\nQn \u2208M\u0303n\nV\n\n\u0012\n\nE\n\nQn\n\n\u0013\n1 n n\n[h ] + \u03b1U (Q ) ,\nqn\nn\n\nwhere the entropic penalty functional \u03b1nU is given by\n(3.2)\n\n\u03b1nU (Qn )\n\n1\n:= inf\ny>0 y\n\n\u0012\n\nE\n\nPn\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0014 \u0012\ndQn\nn\n+ xy \u2212 uU (x) .\nV y n\ndP\nn\n\nHere, V is from (2.8), and M\u0303nV is the subset of Mn such that EP [V (dQn /dPn )] < \u221e.\nFor U \u2208 U\u03b1 , Lemma A.2 below implies that M\u0303nV = M\u0303n and hence the variational problem above is\ntaken over the same set of measures. Furthermore, as qn \u2192 \u221e, the factor of (1/qn ) in front of \u03b1nU (Qn )\nmeans small values of V (z) may be disregarded. Therefore, by (2.9) one may replace V (z) with V\u03b1 (z) in\n(3.2). Calculation then shows that \u03b1nU (Qn ) \u2248 x + (1/\u03b1) (log(\u2212\u03b1unU (x)) + H (Qn | Pn )), and hence\npnU (x, qn ; hn )\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\nn\nn\nn\nQn\nn\n\u2248\nlog(\u2212\u03b1uU (x)) + inf\nE [h ] + H (Q | P ) .\nqn \u03b1\n\u03b1\nQn \u2208M\u0303n\n\nThus, if lim supn\u2191\u221e unU (x) < U (\u221e) = 0, the only part of pnU (x, qn ; hn ) dependent upon either x or U\nvanishes, and prices come together.\n\n\fLARGE POSITION PRICING\n\n7\n\n3.1. Convergence of Prices. The above argument is made precise under the following assumptions. First,\nit assumed that hn is uniformly bounded in n:\nAssumption 3.1. khk := supn khn kL\u221e (\u03a9n ,F n ,Pn ) < \u221e.\nThe next assumption essentially rules out arbitrage opportunities when investing in S n , both for each n\n(see [37, Assumption 1.4]) and as n \u2191 \u221e. Recall, from Section 2.1 the definitions of M\u0303n and the relative\nentropy H (Qn | Pn ).\nAssumption 3.2. M\u0303n 6= \u2205 for each n and lim supn\u2191\u221e inf Qn \u2208M\u0303n H (Qn | Pn ) < \u221e.\nRegarding Assumption 3.2, it is well known (see [25, 37, 15]) that for the exponential utility U\u03b1 ,\n\u0012\n\u0011\u0013\n\u0010\n1\nn\nn\nn\nn\nn\nQn\n(3.3)\nuU\u03b1 (x, qn ; h ) = \u2212 exp \u2212\u03b1x \u2212 inf\n\u03b1qn E [h ] + H (Q | P )\n.\n\u03b1\nQn \u2208M\u0303n\n\nNow, consider when qn \u2261 0 and Assumption 3.2 does not hold : i.e. for each k = 1, 2, . . . there is an\ninteger nk such that inf Qnk \u2208M\u0303nk H (Qnk | Pnk ) > k. Since the infimum is strictly bigger than k, (3.3)\n\nimplies the existence of an admissible trading strategy H(nk ) such that\n\u0015\n\u0014\nk\nnk\nnk\n\u2265 1 \u2212 e\u2212k/2 .\nP\n(H (nk ) * S )T \u2265\n2\u03b1\nTherefore, a very strong form of asymptotic arbitrage holds : namely, there exists a sequence of admissible\ntrading strategies such that the probability that the terminal wealth fails to grow like k decreases to 0 exponentially fast on the order of k. An asymptotic arbitrage of the form above is similar to a strong arbitrage\nas defined in [20]: see this reference for a more detailed discussion on the topic.\nRemark 3.3. As shown in Proposition 6.1 below, Assumption 3.2 implies for all U \u2208 U\u03b1 and x \u2208 R that\nlim supn\u2191\u221e unU (x) < 0 = U (\u221e). This corresponds to the preclusion of asymptotic arbitrage as mentioned\nin the introduction.\nThe main result is now presented:\nTheorem 3.4. Let Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 hold. Let \u03b1 > 0. If qn \u2192 \u221e then for all U1 , U2 \u2208 U\u03b1 and\nx1 , x2 \u2208 R\n(3.4)\n\nlim pnU1 (x1 , qn ; hn ) \u2212 pnU2 (x2 , qn ; hn ) = 0.\n\nn\u2191\u221e\n\nRemark 3.5. Since for any U \u2208 U\u03b1 and x \u2208 R, pnU (x, qn ; hn ) = \u2212pnU (x, \u2212qn ; \u2212hn ) the convergence in\nTheorem 3.4 remains valid for qn \u2192 \u2212\u221e as well.\n3.2. Convergence of Total Quantities. Results are now stated which, for x1 , x2 \u2208 R and U1 , U2 \u2208 U\u03b1 ,\nensure the total monetary difference\nqn pnU1 (x1 , qn ; hn ) \u2212 pnU2 (x2 , qn ; hn ) ,\n\n\f8\n\nLARGE POSITION PRICING\n\nremains bounded as n \u2191 \u221e. The message is that an investor with utility function U \u2208 U\u03b1 and initial capital\nx \u2208 R may price as if she were an exponential investor with risk aversion \u03b1 and the error in the total amount\nof money spent by using this approximation remains bounded, even in the large claim limit.\nThis type of convergence will not take place under the general conditions of Theorem 3.4 (see Example\n3.12) and requires stronger assumptions upon the utility functions. However, under these stronger assumptions it is not necessary for the claim to remain uniformly bounded as in Assumption 3.1. Therefore,\nassume:\nAssumption 3.6. For each n, hn \u2208 L\u221e (\u03a9n , F n , Pn ).\nAs for the class of utility functions, convergence results are proved for \u0168\u03b1 \u2282 U\u03b1 defined by:\nDefinition 3.7.\n(3.5)\n\n\u0168\u03b1 :=\n\n(\n\n)\nU (x)\nU (x)\nU \u2208 U\u03b1 : 0 < lim inf\n\u2264 lim sup\n<\u221e .\nx\u2193\u2212\u221e U\u03b1 (x)\nx\u2193\u2212\u221e U\u03b1 (x)\n\nRemark 3.8. In Example 2.5, if for j = 1, ..., J, Uj (x) = \u2212(1/\u03b1j )e\u2212\u03b1j x then U \u2208 \u0168\u03b1 . Similarly, in\nExample 2.6, if the Uj therein additionally satisfy Uj \u2208 \u0168\u03b1j for j = 1, .., J then U \u2208 \u0168\u03b1 .\nWith these definitions and assumptions, total monetary errors are bounded:\nTheorem 3.9. Let \u03b1 > 0. Let Assumptions 3.2 and 3.6 hold. If qn \u2192 \u221e then for all U1 , U2 \u2208 \u0168\u03b1 and\nx1 , x2 \u2208 R\n(3.6)\n\nlim sup qn pnU1 (x1 , qn ; hn ) \u2212 pnU2 (x2 , qn ; hn ) < \u221e.\nn\u2191\u221e\n\nRemark 3.10. For the exponential utility price pnU\u03b1 (qn ; hn ) of Remark 2.7, consider when Theorem 3.9 holds\nand pnU\u03b1 (qn ; hn ) converges to some limit p\u03b1 . Even though for x \u2208 R, U \u2208 \u0168\u03b1 both limn\u2191\u221e pnU (x, qn ; hn ) =\np\u03b1 and lim supn\u2191\u221e qn |pnU (x, qn ; hn )\u2212pnU\u03b1 (qn ; hn )| < \u221e hold, it still might be that limn\u2191\u221e qn |pnU (x, qn ; hn )\u2212\np\u03b1 | = \u221e (see Proposition 5.7 for examples). Here, even though the error in the total amount spent by using\nexponential utility prices (instead of the original utility U ) remains bounded, the error introduced by using\nthe limiting price for exponential utility tends towards infinity.\n3.3. Pricing when Only the Position is Changing. Assume only the position size changes with n, i.e.:\n(\u03a9n , F n , Fn , Pn ) \u2261 (\u03a9, F, F, P), S n \u2261 S and hn \u2261 h. Write pU (x, q; h) for pnU (x, q; h) and M\u0303 for M\u0303n .\nUnder Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2, [37, Proposition 7.5] proves, for all U \u2208 U\u03b1 and x \u2208 R:\n(3.7)\n\nlim pU (x, qn ; h) = inf EQ [h] .\n\nn\u2191\u221e\n\nQ\u2208M\u0303\n\nFor exponential utilities, (3.7) has been shown in [3, 32]. In fact, for general utilities, (2.3) is not necessary\nfor this result to hold: [37] proves (3.7) follows for all utility functions satisfying the Inada and Reasonable\nAsymptotic Elasticity conditions given in Section 2.2. Additionally, by using duality theory for Orlicz\nspaces induced by the utility function, [4, Proposition 4.2] proves an analogous statement to (3.7) for non\nlocally bounded semimartingales under very weak conditions upon the utility function.\n\n\fLARGE POSITION PRICING\n\n9\n\n3.4. Examples. Examples are given to highlight the necessity of a) (2.3) in Definition 2.4 and b) (3.5) in\nDefinition 3.7. Each of the examples considers the one period trinomial model. Here the filtered space is\n\u03a9 = {1, 2, 3}, F = P \u03a9 , F0 = {\u2205, \u03a9}, F1 = F.

Lastly, for each n, let 0 < pn < 1/2 and define Pn by Pn (1) = Pn (3) = pn ,\nPn (2) = 1 \u2212 2pn . It is clear that Assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 hold, and, for any utility function U satisfying\nthe Inada conditions, the indifference price pnU (x, qn ; h) satisfies\n(3.9)\n\nU (x) = 2pn U (x \u2212 qn pnU (x, qn ; h) + qn h) + (1 \u2212 2pn )U (x \u2212 qn pnU (x, qn ; h)).\n\n3.4.1.

Each of these articles show,\nunder suitable hypothesis, that as absolute risk aversion increases to infinity, if the market and claim are not\nchanging as well, then the (ask) indifference price for one claim converges the super-replication price of the\nclaim. This is entirely consistent with the results in Section 3.3 since therein it is the buyer's indifference\nprice which is considered.\n4. P OWER TAILS\nResults similar to Theorem 3.4 hold for utility functions with power-like decay for large negative wealths.\nHowever, to obtain convergence of prices, the rate at which qn becomes large must be suitably adjusted. This\nphenomenon is not present for utility functions with exponential decay. Proposition 4.3 below makes the\nabove statement precise. To motivate the result, as well as fix notation, define the following class of utility\nfunctions:\nDefinition 4.1. Let p > 1 and l > 0. Define Up,l to be the class of utility functions satisfying limx\u2191\u221e U (x) =\n0 and limx\u2193\u2212\u221e \u2212U (x)/(\u2212x)p = 1/l.\nIt can be shown that U \u2208 Up,l satisfies both the Inada and Reasonable Asymptotic Elasticity conditions.\nFurthermore, for U \u2208 Up,l :\nV (y)\n= 1;\ny\u2191\u221e Vp (y)\n\nVp (y) := \u02c6ly \u03b3 ,\n\nlim\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 := p/(p \u2212 1) is the conjugate exponential to p and \u02c6l := (1/\u03b3)(l/p)\u03b3\u22121 . Now, consider the\nindifference pricing formula from (3.1). The factor (1/qn ) again allows one to disregard small values of\nV (z) when evaluating \u03b1nU (Qn ) and hence one may replace V (z) with Vp (z). A lengthy calculation shows\nfor U \u2208 Up,l that \u03b1nU (Qn ) \u2248 (\u2212lunU (x))1/p EP [(dQn /dPn )\u03b3 ]1/\u03b3 .

Assume that (\u03a9, F, F, P) and the claim\nh do not change with n.

Then, using the notion\nof partial-equilibrium price-quantities (PEPQ) from [1], large positions are shown to endogenously arise\neven in a setting where the buyer must find a single, risk averse seller (as opposed to the more typical\nsituation where there is a collection of market makers) in order to purchase the claims.\nRemark 5.4 (the upper bound follows in a similar manner) implies for each n that the interval of arbitrage\nfree prices for h(YT ) is\n(5.7)\n\nI(h) :=\n\ninf\n\nQn \u2208Mn\n\nE\n\nQn\n\n[h(YT )] , sup E\n\nQn\n\nQn \u2208Mn\n\n[h(YT )]\n\n!\n\n=\n\n!\n\ninf h(y), sup h(y) .\n\ny\u2208E\n\ny\u2208E\n\nLet pn \u2208 I(h) and assume one can buy an arbitrary number of claims for the price pn .

Proposition 5.5 implies that when purchasing optimal quantities, case (iii) in (5.4) never arises.\nCase (i) arises if pn \u2192 p\u0302, where p\u0302 is the unique arbitrage free price in the complete model. For all other\nlimiting prices p, case (ii) arises.\nProposition 5.5 implies the heuristic in (1.2), provided for each n one may buy claims at a price p 6=\np\u0302. At first glance, it may seem unrealistic that one could engage a seller at this price: however this is\nindeed possible in the setting of PEPQ from [1]. To define a PEPQ, some additional notation is needed.\nLet X, X \u2032 be two bounded, FT measurable random variables. For the exponential utility U\u03b1 , denote by\nun\u03b1 (qn ; h, X) := unU\u03b1 (0, qn ; h + X/qn ) the value function for holding qn claims of h(YT ) and one unit of\nX. Now, consider a second exponential investor with risk aversion \u03b4 > 0. A pair (qn , pn ) where pn \u2208 I(h)\nis called a PEPQ in the nth market if\nqn \u2208 argmaxq\u2208R (e\u03b1qn pn un\u03b1 (qn ; h, X)) ;\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nqn \u2208 argmaxq\u2208R e\u2212\u03b4qn pn un\u03b4 (\u2212qn ; h, X \u2032 ) .\n\nIn other words, (qn , pn ) is a PEPQ if, for the price pn , it is optimal for the \u03b4 risk averse investor to sell qn\nunits of h(YT ) and for the \u03b1 risk averse investor to buy qn units of h(YT ). As shown in [1, Theorem 5.8,\nRemark 5.0, Corollary 3.16], if \u03b1X \u2212 \u03b4X \u2032 is not replicable then there exists a unique PEPQ with qn 6= 0,\notherwise there is no PEPQ. This is the reason why the additional endowments X, X \u2032 must be added.\nNow, let X \u2261 0 and assume the seller holds a position in h consistent with (1.2): i.e. X \u2032 = (\u03b4\u03b3/(1 \u2212\n\u03c12n ))h(YT ) for some \u03b3 > 0. Since h(YT ) is not replicable, it follows that a PEPQ (pn , qn ) exists. Furthermore, (pn , qn ) must satisfy the optimality conditions (recall (5.9) for qn = \u03b3n /(1 \u2212 \u03c12n )):\npn = g(\u03c1n , \u03b1\u03b3n ) = g(\u03c1n , \u03b4(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3n )).\nIt clearly holds that \u03b3n = \u03b3\u03b4/(\u03b4 + \u03b1) and pn satisfies pn = g(\u03c1n , \u03b3\u03b1\u03b4/(\u03b1 + \u03b4)). Such a pn exists by\nLemma 7.1 below, and, as \u03c1n \u2192 1 it follows that pn \u2192 p 6= p\u0302 where p = g(1, \u03b3\u03b1\u03b4/(\u03b1 + \u03b4)). Thus, with\nboth buyer and seller acting optimally, the buyer enters into the regime of (1.2) and the seller is willing to\nsell for a price pn \u2248 p 6= p\u0302. The message is that as long as there exists a single investor in the regime of\n(1.2), whether or not she has entered it optimally, it possible for other investors, acting optimally, to enter\ninto the regime (1.2) as well. Given the actual notional sizes existing in the market, it is entirely reasonable\nto assume some investor is in the regime of (1.2).\n5.4. Monetary Errors. It is of interest to know when the monetary error, introduced by using the limiting\nexponential utility price, remains bounded. The following Proposition identifies precise conditions on the \u03b3n\nfrom (5.4) when this is the case. Then, assuming for each n that one can buy claims for a fixed p \u2208 I(h) it is\nshown that if one buys the optimal number of claims as in Proposition 5.5 so that \u03b3n satisfies p = g(\u03c1n , \u03b3n ),\nthen monetary errors are always bounded. For the sake of brevity, case (iii) is excluded.\nProposition 5.7. Let \u03b1 > 0. Let Assumption 5.1 hold.

Since it is clear 0 \u2264 p \u2264 h, first assume that 0 \u2264 p < h. Since\n\u00db (\u221e) = 0, it follows that \u00db (x) = limn\u2191\u221e e\u2212qn \u00db (x \u2212 qn pn ).

Thus, since (1 \u2212\n\u03c1n )/(1 \u2212 \u03c12n ) \u2264 1, terms in the Taylor expansion which involve partials with respect to \u03c1, even when\ndivided by 1 \u2212 \u03c12n , remain bounded as n \u2191 \u221e.

Now, consider case (ii) : here p\u03b1 = \u2212(1/\u03b3) log(f (1, \u03b3)).

Now, let p \u2208 I(h) and assume \u03b3n is chosen optimally from Proposition\n5.5 so that p = g(\u03c1n , \u03b3n ). If p = p\u0302 then by (5.10), since pn = p\u0302 for all n it holds that supn |qn | < \u221e\nand hence the monetary error is trivially finite. If p 6= p\u0302, by Proposition 5.5 again, \u03b3n \u2192 \u03b3 6= 0 where\np = g(1, \u03b3).

Furthermore, Qn,qn\n\nsolves the dual problem. This latter fact follows by considering the (potentially non-admissible) trading\nstrategy \u03c0t := (1/\u03b1\u03c3(Yt ))(\u03bb(Yt ) + (\u03c1n )/(1 \u2212 \u03c12n )\u03b8tn ) and showing that the corresponding wealth process\nX \u03c0 and dQn,qn /dP satisfy the first order conditions for optimality.

The convexity of V implies f (\u03b5, Y ) \u2264\nV ((1 + y)Y ) \u2212 V (yY ) \u2212 V (yY )/y. That \u2202y E [V (yY )] = E [Y V \u2032 (yY )] now follows by applying the\ndominated convergence theorem to f (\u03b5, Y ), since Lemma A.2 implies E [V (yY )] < \u221e for all y > 0.\nNow, consider the map g(y) := E [Y V \u2032 (yY )]. The strict convexity of V implies g is strictly increasing.\nSince limz\u2193 zV \u2032 (z) = 0 (because U is bounded from above), there is some constant C > 0 such that\nY V \u2032 (yY ) > \u2212C for y > 1.
