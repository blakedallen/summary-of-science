We shall consider the periodic timedependent Hamiltonian system generated by a function H : R \u00d7 T \u2217 M \u2212\u2192 R, and denote by \u03c6ts\nthe flow from time s to time t.\n(0.1) In order to motivate our discussion, we begin with a precise question: Given two Lagrangian manifolds G and G \u2032 in the cotangent bundle, which are graphs over the base M , does\nthere exist a trajectory which connects G and G \u2032 , or in other words does there exist times s < t\nsuch that the Lagrangian manifold \u03c6ts (G) intersects G \u2032 ?\n(0.2) This question formulates some well known problems. As an example, let us suppose that\nM = Td , and identify the cotangent bundle T \u2217 Td with Td \u00d7 Rd . Let us consider the Hamiltonian\nH0 = h(p), where h : Rd \u2212\u2192 R is a real function. Such Hamiltonians will be called fully integrable\nin the sequel. It is known that they leave invariant the tori Tp := Td \u00d7 {p}, for p \u2208 Rd . As a\nconsequence, the answer to the previous question is obviously negative for G = Tp and G \u2032 = Tp\u2032 ,\nwhen p 6= p\u2032 . What happens for Hamiltonians H which are close to H0 ? For example, it is known\nthat the solar system can be described by a fully integrable Hamiltonian H0 if the interactions\nbetween planets are neglected. In this example, the variables p \u2208 Rd encode the parameters of\nthe elliptic trajectories of the planets. It is well known that these parameters would not change\nin time if the interaction between planets did not exist. Understanding for which values of p and\np\u2032 the question (0.1) has a positive answer with G = Tp and G \u2032 = Tp\u2032 , amounts to understand\nto what extent the elliptic trajectories will deform under the influence of mutual interactions. In\nother words, it amounts to understand the secular dynamics, and the stability of the solar system.\nWe will not treat these specific examples in the present papers, although they are parts of our\nmotivations. See [1] and [22] for beautiful and deep examples of perturbations of fully integrable\nsystems.\n(0.3) Question (0.1) is especially interesting when the Lagrangian manifolds G and G \u2032 have\ndifferent Liouville classes (which corresponds to the case p 6= p\u2032 in the discussion above). In this\ncase, we have a problem of non exact Lagrangian intersection, and it seems that the powerful\ntools developed to deal with exact intersections provide no interesting insight. In order to study\nthis problems, we make strong assumptions on the Hamiltonian H, namely that it is convex,\nsuper-linear, periodically time-dependent, and complete, see details in (1.1). We will define an\nequivalence relation, called forcing relation and denoted by \u22a3\u22a2 on the set H 1 (M, R) of cohomology\nclasses of Lagrangian graphs, in such a way that, if c\u22a3\u22a2c\u2032 , (we will say that c and c\u2032 force each\nover) then the answer to question (0.1) is positive for each Lagrangian graphs G of cohomology c\nand G \u2032 of cohomology c\u2032 . The definition of this equivalence relation is one of the major ideas of\nthe present paper. The key point in considering an equivalence relation is that local informations\non the equivalence classes can be put together to obtain global information. On the other hand,\nmost of the mechanisms known so far to study questions related to (0.1), the theorem of Birkhoff\nfor twist maps, the geometric construction of Arnold, as well as the variational construction of\nMather, can be expressed in this unified setting as local informations on the forcing classes (the\nclasses of equivalence of the relation \u22a3\u22a2). Our main goal in the present paper will be to detail this\nfact and to study the local properties of the forcing classes.\n(0.4) In order to demonstrate the usefulness of our theory, let us provide an example. Proofs\nand more general statements are given in section 11. We take M = T \u00d7 Td\u22121 , and denote by\n(q, p) = (q1 , q2 , p1 , p2 ) the points of T \u2217 M , where q1 \u2208 T, q2 \u2208 Td\u22121 , p1 \u2208 R, p2 \u2208 Rd\u22121 . We\nconsider the time-periodic Hamiltonian\nH(t, q, p) = H1 (t, q1 , p1 ) + |p2 |2 \u2212 V (q2 )F (t, q)\n\n2\n\n\fand we assume that the conditions of convexity, super-linearity and completeness are satisfied.\nIn addition, we assume that F : T \u00d7 Td \u2212\u2192 R takes positive values, and that V : Td\u22121 \u2212\u2192 R\ntakes positive values except at a single point, say 0, where its takes the value 0. The manifold\nT \u00d7 R := {q2 = 0, p2 = 0} is then invariant under the Hamiltonian Flow. The restricted flow is\ngenerated by the restricted Hamiltonian H1 . Under these hypotheses, it is not hard to prove (we\nwill do it) that each rotational invariant circle of the restricted dynamics H1 admits a homoclinic\norbit. We make two additional non-degeneracy assumptions:\n(H1) The Hamiltonian H1 is generic in the sense that its irrotational invariant circles of rational\nrotation number are completely periodic. (We allow periodic circles in order to include the case\nwhere H1 is integrable).\n(H2) We assume a non-degeneracy hypothesis on the set of action minimizing homoclinic\norbits to the invariant circles of H1 . This hypothesis is detailed in section 11, it should be seen as\nanalogous to the classical hypothesis of transversality of the stable and unstable manifolds in the\nconstruction of Arnold. Although we expect in the future to prove that this condition is generic\nin some sense, we do not discuss any genericity issue here.\nUnder these hypotheses, our abstract results imply the following.\nTheorem If P and P \u2032 are given real numbers, there exists a Hamiltonian trajectory (q(t), p(t))\nand an integer t \u2208 N such that p1 (0) = P and p1 (t) = P \u2032 .\n(0.5) The systems described in example (0.4) are a priori unstable according to the terminology\nin use in the world of Arnold's diffusion. This is due to the presence of the distinguished invariant\nmanifold {q2 = p2 = 0}, which in many situations is normally hyperbolic. It appears clearly in\nthe fundamental paper of Arnold, [1] that the presence of such a hyperbolic invariant manifold\nintersecting G and G \u2032 greatly favors a positive answer to question (0.1). A priori unstable systems have been widely studied because they appear naturally in the perturbation of completely\nintegrable systems, and are easier to deal with.\nIn the work of Arnold, it is also assumed that the restriction of the dynamics to the hyperbolic\nmanifold is integrable, say H1 = |p1 |2 in our example. This means that this invariant manifold\nis foliated by invariant tori which he called whiskered tori because of the presence of hyperbolicity. These whiskered tori are the building blocks of Arnold's construction, so that this second\nhypothesis was very important. The main point in our application is that we do not make this\nassumption. We only assume that the restricted dynamics is generic, in a clearly specified sense.\nIn the context of perturbations of fully integrable systems, the restriction of the flow to the hyperbolic manifold is close to integrable, and KAM theory implies the existence of many whiskered\ntori. However, when computing precisely the various quantities that appear in Arnold's construction, one observes that there does not exist enough tori in general. More precisely, the gap between\ntori is too big, this is the Large Gap problem, see for example [21] for a more precise explanation.\nOvercoming this problem has long been considered as a major challenge. While the classical\napproaches based on refinements on the scheme of Arnold were worked out in that direction, new\nvariational methods were introduced, by John Mather in [24]. It is also worth mentioning the\nwork of Bessi, [7], where the results sketched by Arnold are proved using variational methods.\nThis paper contains one on the first relevant achievements of variational methods in these kind\nof questions, and it has been very influential. However, these variational methods were facing the\nsame kind of difficulties as classical methods. In several special instances, the Large Gap problem\ncan be bypassed because for specific reasons there exist more whiskered tori. This remark has been\nexploited to obtain many non-trivial results from Arnold's construction or variational methods.\nFor example, orbits of unbounded speed where built in [8] using the scheme of Arnold. A similar\nresult had previously been obtained by John Mather, [25], using variational methods, see also [19].\nOther works exploit the same remark in different directions, see for example [6], which elaborates\non [7], and many other texts.\nSolutions to the Large Gap problem have recently been given by Delshams, de la Llave and\nSeara, see [13], and by Treschev, see [29] using elaborations on Arnold's method. The details in\nthese works are far from simple. Cheng and Yan have also proposed a solution using elaborations\n\n3\n\n\fon the variational methods initiated by Mather, see [9], and [10], as well as Z. Xia, see [30] and\n[31]. Compared to these papers, the spirit of our work is different. We present mechanisms of\ninstability which are more general, but more abstract. We present some examples for illustration,\nand in order to give the reader a hint of how the abstract mechanisms can be used, but we do not\ntry at that point to describe the more general applications. Neither do we discusss the genericity\nof our hypotheses.\nThe influence of John Mather's published and unpublished works on the developpement of\nvariational approaches could not be overestimated. He has announced in [26] very deep results\non the perturbation of fully integrable systems in dimension 2, and given indications on proofs in\nvarious talks and lectures. I hope that the tools developed in the present paper will contribute to\nclarify and extend these results.\n(0.6) Let us now enter more precisely into matter. Given a Lipschitz function u : M \u2212\u2192 R and\na closed smooth form \u03b7 on M , we consider the subset G\u03b7,u of T \u2217 M defined by\n\b\nG\u03b7,u = (x, \u03b7x + dux ), x \u2208 M such that dux exists .\n\nWe call the subset G \u2282 T \u2217 M an overlapping pseudograph if there exists a closed smooth form \u03b7\nand a semi-concave function u such that G = G\u03b7,u . See Appendix A for the definition of semiconcave functions. Each pseudograph G has a well defined cohomology c(G) \u2208 H 1 (M, R), see\n(2.2), which is just the De Rham cohomology [\u03b7] of the closed form appearing in the definition of\nG. We denote by P the set of overlapping pseudographs. If M = T is a circle, then overlapping\npseudographs are graphs of functions which have only discontinuities with downward jumps, or in\nother words functions which can be locally written as the sum of a continuous and a decreasing\nfunction. Such sets were introduced in [20], where they are used in very elegant proofs of many\nknown properties of Twist maps. In higher dimension, overlapping pseudographs naturally arise\nfrom Fathi's approach of Mather theory.\n(0.7) We define the forcing relation \u22a3\u22a2 on H 1 (M, R) as follows: We say that c and c\u2032 force\neach other (in short c\u22a3\u22a2c\u2032 ) if there exists an integer N \u2208 N such that, for each pseudograph G of\ncohomology c (resp. c\u2032 ), there exists a pseudograph G \u2032 of cohomology c\u2032 (resp. c) such that\n[\nG\u2032 \u2282\n\u03c6i0 (G),\n16i6N\n\nwhere G \u2032 is the closure of G \u2032 in T \u2217 M . This definition is certainly one of the most important novelties\nin the present paper. Note that, if c\u22a3\u22a2c\u2032 , if G is a Lagrangian graph of cohomology c, and if G \u2032 is a\nLagrangian graph of cohomology c\u2032 , then there exists a Hamiltonian orbit which connects G and G \u2032 .\nAs a consequence, understanding the equivalence classes of this relation is a useful tool in the study\nof our motivating question. Our main goal in the present paper will be to find sufficient conditions\nfor two classes to be equivalent. It turns out that, although the definition seems very strong, the\nexistence of non-trivial forcing classes can be proved in many interesting situations, as example\n(0.4). In fact, many of the known constructions of orbits connecting prescribed regions of phase\nspace (Birkhoff's theory of twist maps, Mather's variational construction of connecting orbits,\nArnold's geometric construction of diffusion) can be adapted to this framework, and rephrased as\nthe existence of large forcing classes.\n(0.8) We shall define, following Fathi, an operator \u03a6 : P \u2212\u2192 P in (2.5), with the following\nfundamental properties:\n\u03a6(G) \u2282 \u03c6(G),\nwhere \u03c6 := \u03c610 is the time-one map of the Hamiltonian flow, and c(\u03a6(G)) = c(G). Fathi's weak\nKAM theorem, [16] states that, for each c \u2208 H 1 (M, R), the operator \u03a6 has fixed points of cohomology c. We call Vc the set of these fixed points, see section 3 for details. The fixed points G\nsatisfy\nG \u2282 \u03c6(G),\n4\n\n\fand give rise to compact invariant sets\n\u0128(G) :=\n\n\\\n\n\u03c6\u2212i (\u1e20).\n\ni\u2208N\n\nThis provides a new way, due to Albert Fathi, to define various invariant sets previously introduced\nby Mather in [23] and [24].\n(0.9) More precisely, to each cohomology c \u2208 H 1 (M, R) we associate the non-empty compact\ninvariant sets\nM\u0303(c) \u2282 \u00c3(c) \u2282 \u00d1 (c),\nwhere\n\u00c3(c) :=\n\n\\\n\n\u0128(G) and \u00d1 (c) :=\n\nG\u2208Vc\n\n[\n\n\u0128(G),\n\nG\u2208Vc\n\nare respectively called the Aubry set and the Ma\u00f1\u00e9 set, and M\u0303(c), called the Mather set, is the\nunion of the supports of the invariant measures of the action of \u03c6 on \u00c3(c) (or equivalently on\n\u00d1 (c)), see (3.5) for more details. A standing notation will be to denote by X\u0303 subsets of T \u2217 M ,\nand by X their projection on M .\nBeyond answering question (0.1), understanding the forcing relation \u22a3\u22a2 has many dynamical\nconsequences:\n(0.10)\n\nProposition.\n\n(i) Let G and G \u2032 be two Lagrangian graphs of cohomologies c and c\u2032 . If c\u22a3\u22a2c\u2032 then there exists\na time t \u2208 N such that \u03c6t0 (G) intersects G \u2032 .\n(ii) If c\u22a3\u22a2c\u2032 , there exists a heteroclinic trajectory of the Hamiltonian flow between \u00c3(c) and\n\u00c3(c\u2032 ).\n(iii) Let ci , i \u2208 Z, be a sequence of cohomology classes all of which force the others. Fix, for each\ni a neighborhood Ui of M\u0303(ci ) in T \u2217 M . There exists a trajectory of the Hamiltonian flow\nwhich visits in turn all the sets Ui . In addition, if the sequence stabilizes to c\u2212 on the left,\nor (and) to c+ on the right, the trajectory can be assumed negatively asymptotic to A(c\u2212)\nor (and) positively asymptotic to A(c+).\nThe proof is given in section 5. Let us now state our main results which, as announced above,\ndescribe the local structure of the forcing classes.\n(0.11) For each G \u2208 V, we define the subspace R(G) of H 1 (M, R) as the set of cohomology\nclasses of smooth closed one-forms whose support is disjoint from I(G). For each cohomology\nclass c \u2208 H 1 (M, R), we define the subspace R(c) as\n\\\nR(c) =\nR(G) \u2282 H 1 (M, R).\nG\u2208Vc\n\nThe following Theorem reformulates and extends results of John Mather, see [24] and also [3] and\n[9]. It is proved in section 8.\nTheorem. For each c0 \u2208 H 1 (M, R), there exists a positive \u01eb such that the following holds: Each\nclass c \u2208 H 1 (M, R) such that c \u2212 c0 \u2208 R(c0 ) and kc \u2212 c0 k 6 \u01eb satisfies c0 \u22a3\u22a2c.\nIn order to illustrate this result, it is useful to consider the case of twist maps M = T. In this\ncase, the reader should check that R(c) = R or 0, and that R(c) = 0 if and only if there exists a\nrotational invariant circle of cohomology c, see (few) more details in section 10. The above result\nthen roughly says that rotational invariant circles are the only obstructions to the evolution of\naction variables, and recovers the theory of Birkhoff. We will explained in section 11 how this\nresult allows to overcome the possible absence of invariant circles in example (0.4).\n5\n\n\f(0.12) There is a natural partition of the Aubry set \u00c3(c) into compact invariant subsets S\u0303 called\nthe static classes, see section 4. A generalized version of the following theorem is proved in section\n9.\nTheorem.\nAssume that there exists only finitely many static classes in \u00c3(c), and that the\nset \u00d1 (c) \u2212 \u00c3(c) is not empty and contains finitely many orbits. Then the cohomology c is in the\ninterior of its forcing class.\nThis result may be seen as a reinterpretation in our langage of the geometric construction\nof Arnold. We explain in section 11 how it allows to take into account the possible presence of\ninvariant circles of H1 in example (0.4). We mention that, for a generic Lagrangian, all the Aubry\nsets A(c), c \u2208 H 1 (M, R) have finitely many static classes, see [5].\n(0.13) Let us now present the content of the paper. The whole paper heavily relies on the notion\nof semi-concave function and of equi-semi-concave sets of functions. These notions are presented\nin Appendix A. In Appendix B, we prove some background results, essentially due to Mather and\nFathi, about the properties of the Action.\nMather-Fathi Theory.\nThis first part is a survey of the theory of Mather, Ma\u00f1\u00e9 and Fathi of globally minimizing orbits,\nfrom a point of view very close to the one of Fathi. This survey is presented not only for the\nconvenience of the reader, but also because we need various variations on existing results,and\nalso we need to recast the theory in our framework. In section 1, we present the context, detail\nthe standing hypotheses, and recall some known results of the calculus of variations which will\nbe of constant use (proofs are given in Appendix B). Pseudographs are defined and their basic\nproperties studied in Section 2. In Section 3, we use these pseudographs to present Fathi's point\nof view on Aubry-Mather theory. The theory is continued in section 4, where we explain Ma\u00f1\u00e9's\ndecomposition in static classes of the Aubry set, and the construction of homoclinic orbits, due to\nFathi [18], Contreras and Paternain [11], (see also [2]) which will play a central role in section 9.\nAbstract mechanism.\nThis part contains the main novelties of our paper. In section 5 we define the forcing relation \u22a3\u22a2\nand explain how various orbits can be built once this relation is understood. We prove Proposition\n(0.10). We then introduce and study evolution operators on P, which are elaborations around the\nLax-Oleinik operator, in section 6. Section 7 is a parenthesis where we study the action of taking\nfinite Galois covering, which will be essential for applications. The idea of taking finite Galois\ncoverings comes from Fathi [18]. In section 8, we prove and comment Theorem (0.11). In section\n9 we study the case where there exist only finitely many static classes. We generalize and prove\nTheorem (0.12).\nApplications.\nIn this short part, we detail some straightforward applications of the results obtained before. We\nhope that it is possible to obtain much more applications by applying our results with Hamiltonian\nmethods such as normal form theory, but this aspect is not discussed here. Section 10 briefly\nmentions the application to twist maps. Section 11 details (0.4) above.\nMather-Fathi Theory\nThis part is an overview of the theory of Mather, Ma\u00f1\u00e9 and Fathi of globally minimizing orbits,\nwhich is oriented towards our future needs. We introduce our main objects. Our point of view is\nclose to the one of Fathi. Most of the material exposed here is a small deformation of results in\n[23], [15], [27], [12], or [11].\n1\n\nCalculus of variations\n\n(1.1) We shall consider C 2 Hamiltonian functions H : R \u00d7 T \u2217 M \u2212\u2192 R. We will denote by\nP = (x, p) the points of T \u2217 M . The Cotangent bundle is endowed with its standard symplectic\nstructure. We denote by X(t, P ) or X(t, x, p) the Hamiltonian vector-field of H, which is a time6\n\n\fdependent vector-field on T \u2217 M . We fix once and for all a Riemannian metric g on M , and use it to\ndefine norms of tangent vectors and tangent covectors of M . We will denote this norm indifferently\nby |P | or by |p| when P = (x, p) \u2208 Tx\u2217 M . We assume the following standard set of hypotheses.\n1. Periodicity. H(t + 1, P ) = H(t, P ) for each (t, P ) \u2208 R \u00d7 T \u2217 M.\n2. Completeness. The Hamiltonian vector-field X generates a complete flow of diffeomorphisms on T \u2217 M . We denote by \u03c6ts : T \u2217 M \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M the flow from time s to time t, and by\n\u03c6 the flow \u03c610 .\n3. Convexity. For each (t, x) \u2208 R \u00d7 M , the function p \u2212\u2192 H(t, x, p) is convex on Tx\u2217 M ,\nwith positive definite Hessian. Shortly, \u2202p2 H > 0.\n4. Superlinearity. For each (t, x) \u2208 R \u00d7 M , the function p 7\u2212\u2192 H(t, x, p) is super-linear,\nwhich means that lim|p|\u2212\u2192\u221e H(t, x, p)/|p| = \u221e.\n(1.2)\n\nWe associate to the Hamiltonian H a Lagrangian function L : R \u00d7 T M \u2212\u2192 R defined by\nL(t, x, v) = sup p(v) \u2212 H(t, x, p).\np\u2208Tx\u2217 M\n\nThe fiberwise differential \u2202p H of H can be seen as a mapping\n\u2202p H : R \u00d7 T \u2217 M \u2212\u2192 R \u00d7 T M,\nthis mapping is a diffeomorphism, whose inverse is given by\n\u2202v L : R \u00d7 T M \u2212\u2192 R \u00d7 T \u2217 M.\nWe have the relations L(t, x, v) = \u2202v L(t, x, v)(v)\u2212H(t, x, \u2202v L(t, x, v)) and H(t, x, p) = \u2202p H(t, x, p)(p)\u2212\nL(t, x, \u2202p H(t, x, p)). The Lagrangian L satisfies the following properties, which follow from the\nanalogous properties of H:\n1. Periodicity. L(t + 1, V ) = L(t, V ) for each (t, V ) \u2208 R \u00d7 T M.\n2. Convexity. For each (t, x) \u2208 R \u00d7 M , the function v 7\u2212\u2192 L(t, x, v) is a convex function on\nTx M , with positive definite Hessian. Shortly, \u2202v2 L > 0.\n3. Superlinearity. For each (t, x) \u2208 R \u00d7 M , the function v 7\u2212\u2192 L(t, x, v) is super-linear on\nTx M .\nSee Appendix B for comments related to these hypotheses. The hypotheses listed above are very\nsuitable to use the calculus of variations.\n(1.3) Let us fix two times s > t in R and two points x and y in M . Let \u03a3(t, x; s, y) be the set\nof absolutely continuous curves \u03b3 : [t, s] \u2212\u2192R M such that \u03b3(t) = x and \u03b3(s) = y. As usual, we\ns\ndefine the action of the curve \u03b3 as A(\u03b3) = t L(\u03c3, \u03b3(\u03c3), \u03b3\u0307(\u03c3)) d\u03c3. It is known that, for each C,\nthe set of curves \u03b3 in \u03a3(t, x; s, y) which satisfy A(\u03b3) 6 C is compact for the topology of uniform\nconvergence. As a consequence, there exist curves minimizing the action. Let us define the value\nZ s\nA(t, x; s, y) =\nmin\nL(\u03c3, \u03b3(\u03c3), \u03b3\u0307(\u03c3)) d\u03c3,\n\u03b3\u2208\u03a3(t,x;s,y)\n\nt\n\nand let \u03a3m (t, x; s, y) be the set of curves in \u03a3 reaching the above minimum. The set \u03a3m (t, x; s, y)\nis not empty, and it is compact for the topology of uniform convergence. Each curve \u03b3(\u03c3) \u2208 \u03a3m\nis C 2 and satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equations. Setting\np(\u03c3) = \u2202v L(\u03c3, \u03b3(\u03c3), \u03b3\u0307(\u03c3)),\nwhich is equivalent to\n\u03b3\u0307(\u03c3) = \u2202p H(\u03c3, \u03b3(\u03c3), p(\u03c3)),\nthese equations are\n\u1e57(\u03c3) = \u2202x L(\u03c3, \u03b3(\u03c3), \u03b3\u0307(\u03c3)) = \u2212\u2202x H(\u03c3, \u03b3(\u03c3), p(\u03c3))\nHence the curve (\u03b3(\u03c3), p(\u03c3)) is a trajectory of the Hamiltonian flow.\n7\n\n\f(1.4)\n\nFor each minimizing curve \u03b3 \u2208 \u03a3m (t, x; s, y), we have\n\u2212p(t) = \u2212\u2202v L(t, x, \u03b3\u0307(t)) \u2208 \u2202x+ A(t, x; s, y),\n\nwhere \u2202x+ A(t, x; s, y) denotes the set of proximal super-differentials of q 7\u2212\u2192 A(t, q; s, y) at point\nq = x, see Appendix A. We also have\np(s) = \u2202v L(s, y, \u03b3\u0307(s)) \u2208 \u2202y+ A(t, x; s, y).\nFor each t\u2032 > t, the set of functions (x, y) 7\u2212\u2192 A(t, x; s, y), s > t\u2032 is equi-semi-concave on M \u00d7 M ,\nhence equi-Lipschitz, see Appendix A. In addition, the three following properties are equivalent:\n(i) The set \u03a3m (t, x; s, y) contains only one point.\n(ii) The function A(t, .; s, y) is differentiable at x.\n(iii) The function A(t, x; s, .) is differentiable at y.\nIf these equivalent properties hold, and if \u03b3(\u03c3) is the unique curve of \u03a3m (t, x; s, y), then setting\np(\u03c3) = \u2202v L(\u03c3, y, \u03b3\u0307(\u03c3)), we have\np(t) = \u2212\u2202x A(t, x; s, y) and p(s) = \u2202y A(t, x; s, y).\n(1.5) Let \u03b7 be a smooth one-form. We will see the form \u03b7 sometimes as a section of the\ncotangent bundle \u03b7 : M \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M and sometimes as a fiberwise linear function on the tangent\nbundle \u03b7 : T M \u2212\u2192 R. If the form \u03b7 is closed then the diffeomorphism \u03c6\u03b7 : (x, p) 7\u2212\u2192 (x, p + \u03b7x )\nof T \u2217 M is symplectic. The Hamiltonian\nH\u03b7 (t, x, p) = H \u25e6 \u03c6\u03b7 (t, x, p) = H(t, x, p + \u03b7x )\nsatisfies our hypotheses. The associated Lagrangian is (L \u2212 \u03b7)(t, x, v) = L(t, x, v) \u2212 \u03b7x (v), where\n\u03b7 is considered as a function on T M . The following diagram commutes for each t.\nT \u2217M\nv;; OO EEE\nv\n\u2202v L vv\nEEH\nv\nEE\nvv\nv\nE\"\"\nv\n\u03c6\u03b7\nT MH\n<< R\nHH\nyy\nHH\ny\ny\nHH\nyy\n\u2202v (L\u2212\u03b7) HH\nyy H\u03b7\n##\nT \u2217M\n(1.6)\n\nWe will also consider the modified action\nZ s\nA\u03b7 (t, x; s, y) =\ninf\nL(\u03c3, \u03b3(\u03c3), \u03b3\u0307(\u03c3)) \u2212 \u03b7\u03b3(\u03c3) (\u03b3\u0307(\u03c3)) d\u03c3,\n\u03b3\u2208\u03a3(t,x;s,y)\n\nt\n\nwhich of course satisfies all the properties of (1.4), with the modified expressions\n\u03b7x \u2212 p(t) \u2208 \u2202x+ A\u03b7 (t, x; s, y) and p(s) \u2212 \u03b7y \u2208 \u2202y+ A\u03b7 (t, x; s, y)\nwhen (\u03b3(\u03c3), p(\u03c3)) : [s, t] \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M is the Hamiltonian trajectory associated to a curve \u03b3 \u2208\n\u03a3(t, x; s, y) minimizing A\u03b7 .\n(1.7) Let \u03a9 be the set of closed smooth forms on M . It is useful to fix once and for all a linear\nsection S of the projection \u03a9 \u2212\u2192 H 1 (M, R). In other words, S is a linear mapping from H 1 (M, R)\nto \u03a9 such that [S(c)] = c. We shall abuse notations and denote by c the form S(c), in such a\nway that the symbol c denotes either a cohomology class or a standard form representing this\ncohomology class.\n8\n\n\f(1.8) The following consequence of Appendix B will be useful. See appendix A for the definition\nof equi-semi-concave.\nProposition. If C is a bounded subset of H 1 (M, R), and \u01eb is a positive number, the functions\nAc (s, .; t, .), c \u2208 C, t > s + \u01eb are equi-semi-concave on M \u00d7 M .\n2\n\nOverlapping pseudographs.\n\nWe present the main objects, overlapping pseudographs, and study some basic properties. The\nrelevance of semi-concave functions to this kind of problems was noticed by Albert Fathi.\n(2.1) Given a Lipschitz function u : M \u2212\u2192 R and a smooth form \u03b7 on M , we define the subset\nG\u03b7,u of T \u2217 M by\n\b\nG\u03b7,u = (x, \u03b7x + dux ), x \u2208 M such that dux exists .\n\nWe call the subset G \u2282 T \u2217 M an overlapping pseudograph if there exists a smooth form \u03b7 and a\nsemi-concave function u such that G = G\u03b7,u . See Appendix A for the definition of semi-concave\nfunctions. We shall denote by P the set of overlapping pseudographs. Given a pseudograph G,\nand a subset U \u2282 M , we will denote by G|U the set G|U := G \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (U ).\n(2.2) It is not hard to see that if an overlapping pseudograph G is represented in two ways\nas G\u03b7,u and G\u03bc,v , then the closed forms \u03b7 and \u03bc have the same cohomology in H 1 (M, R). As a\nconsequence, it is possible to associate to each pseudograph G a cohomology c(G), in such a way\nthat\nc(G\u03b7,u ) = [\u03b7].\nWe will denote by Pc the set of overlapping pseudographs of cohomology c. If G is an overlapping\npseudograph of cohomology c, then G can be represented in the form G = Gc,u , where c is the\nstandard form defined in (1.7). The function u is then uniquely defined up to an additive constant.\nAs a consequence, denoting by S the set of semi-concave functions on M , and by P the set of\noverlapping pseudographs, we have the identification\nP = H 1 (M, R) \u00d7 S/R.\nThis identification endows P with the structure of a real vector space. Let us endow the factor\nS/R with the norm |u| = (max u \u2212 min u)/2, which is the norm induced from the uniform norm\non S. More precisely, we have |u| = minv kvk\u221e , where the minimum is taken on functions v which\nrepresent the class u. We put on P the norm\nkGc,u k = |c| + (max u \u2212 min u)/2 6 |c| + kuk\u221e .\nThe set P is now a normed vector space. It is also useful to define, for each subset U \u2282 M , the\nnumber\nkGc,u kU := |c| + (sup u \u2212 inf u)/2.\nU\n\nU\n\nWe define in the same way the set P\u0306 of anti-overlapping pseudographs \u011e, which are the sets G\u03b7,\u2212u ,\nwith \u03b7 a smooth form and u \u2208 S. This set is similarly a normed vector space.\n(2.3) Lemma.\nLet G be an overlapping pseudograph, and \u011e be an anti-overlapping pseudograph. If G and \u011e have the same cohomology, then they have nonempty intersection.\nProof. Let us write G = G\u03b7,u and \u011e = G\u03b7,\u2212v . Let x \u2208 M be a point minimizing the continuous\nfunction u + v. Since they are semi-concave, both u and v are differentiable at x, and dux = \u2212dvx .\nIt follows that the point (x, \u03b7x + dux ) = (x, \u03b7x \u2212 dvx ) belongs both to G and to \u011e.\nIt is natural to introduce the following definition.\n\n9\n\n\fDefinition.\nLet G be an overlapping pseudograph, and \u011e be an anti-overlapping pseudograph.\nIf G and \u011e have the same cohomology c, write them G = Gc,u and \u011e = Gc,\u016d . We denote by\nG \u2227 \u011e \u2282 M\n \u0303 \u011e \u2282 G \u2229 \u011e the set\nthe set of points of minimum of the difference u \u2212 \u016d, and by G \u2227\n \u0303 \u011e := G \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (G \u2227 \u011e) = \u011e \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (G \u2227 \u011e) = G \u2229 \u011e \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (G \u2227 \u011e) \u2282 T \u2217 M.\nG\u2227\nThis set is compact, not empty, and it is a Lipschitz graph over its projection G \u2227 \u011e.\nProof. We have proved already that the set G \u2227 \u011e is not empty. It follows from Appendix (A.8)\nthat both u and \u016d are differentiable on G \u2227 \u011e, and that the map x 7\u2212\u2192 dux = \u2212d\u016dx is Lipschitz on\n \u0303 \u011e is compact because it is the image\nthis set. This makes the definition meaningful. The set G \u2227\nof the compact set G \u2227 \u011e by a Lipschitz map.\n(2.4) Let us fix a closed form \u03b7. We define the associated Lax-Oleinik mapping on C 0 (M, R)\nby the expression\n\u0001\nT\u03b7 u(x) = min u(q) + A\u03b7 (0, q; 1, x)\nq\u2208M\n\nLet us recall some important properties of the Lax-Oleinik mapping, which are all direct consequences of the properties of the function A given in (1.4). For each form \u03b7, The functions\nT\u03b7 u, u \u2208 C(M, R) are equi-semi-concave, see Appendix A. The mapping T\u03b7 is a contraction:\nkT\u03b7 u \u2212 T\u03b7 vk\u221e 6 ku \u2212 vk\u221e .\nTo finish, the mapping T\u03b7 is non-decreasing, and it satisfies T\u03b7 (a + u) = a + T\u03b7 (u) for all real a.\n(2.5)\n\nThere exists a unique mapping \u03a6 : P \u2212\u2192 P such that\n\u03a6(G\u03b7,u ) = G\u03b7,T\u03b7 u\n\nfor all smooth form \u03b7 and all semi-concave function u. We have\nc(\u03a6(G)) = c(G).\nThe mapping \u03a6 is continuous (see (6.2) for the proof of a more general result). For each cohomology\nc, the image \u03a6(Pc ) is a relatively compact subset of Pc , as follows directly from the properties\nof the Lax-Oleinik transformation recalled above. Note that this implies the existence of a fixed\npoint of \u03a6 in each Pc , this is how Fathi proved the existence of fixed points. See (3.2) for another\nproof. We call Vc the set of these fixed points, and V = \u222ac Vc . We also define the sets\n\\\n\\\n\u03a6n (P) =\n\u03a6n (P)\nO :=\nn\u2208N\n\nn\u2208N\n\nand Oc := O\u2229Pc . Note that Oc is compact and invariant under \u03a6, and that V \u2282 O. A pseudograph\nG \u2208 Pc belongs to O if and only if there exists a sequence Gn \u2208 P, n \u2208 Z of pseudographs such that\n\u03a6m\u2212n (Gn ) = Gm for all m > n, and such that G0 = G. Note that we then have Gn \u2208 Oc for each\nn \u2208 Z.\n(2.6)\n\nThe mapping \u03a6 satisfies\n\u03a6(G) \u2282 \u03c6(G).\n\nThis inclusion is a consequence of the following Proposition, which will be central througrought\nthe paper.\n\n10\n\n\f(2.7) Proposition\ns < t. Let us set\n\nLet us fix a pseudograph G\u03b7,u \u2208 P, an open set U \u2282 M and two times\nv(x) = min u(q) + A\u03b7 (s, q; t, x),\nq\u2208\u016a\n\nwhere \u016a is the closure of U . Let V \u2282 M be an open set and let N \u2282 M be the set of points where\nthe minimum is reached in the definition of v(x) for some x \u2208 V . If N\u0304 \u2282 U , then\n\u0001\nG\u03b7,v|V \u2282 \u03c6ts G\u03b7,u|N\u0304\nand G\u03b7,u|N\u0304 is a Lipschitz graph above N\u0304 . In other words, the function u is differentiable at each\npoint of N\u0304 , and the mapping q 7\u2212\u2192 duq is Lipschitz on N\u0304 .\nAddendum.\nIn addition, the Hamiltonian trajectories (x(\u03c3), p(\u03c3)) : [s, t] \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M which\nterminate in G\u03b7,v|V , i. e. such that (x(t), p(t)) \u2208 G\u03b7,v|V satisfy\nv(x(t)) = u(x(s)) +\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nL(\u03c3, x(\u03c3), \u1e8b(\u03c3)) \u2212 \u03b7x(\u03c3) (\u1e8b(\u03c3))d\u03c3\ns\n\n= u(x(s)) + A\u03b7 (s, x(s); t, x(t))) = min u(x) + A\u03b7 (s, x; t, x(t))).\nx\u2208U\n\nProof. Let us fix a point x \u2208 V , and consider a point q \u2208 N minimizing in the expression of v(x).\nSince q is a point of local minimum of the function u + A\u03b7 (s, ., t, x), the semi-concave functions u\nand A\u03b7 (s, ., t, x) are differentiable at q and satisfy duq + \u2202q A\u03b7 (s, q, t, x) = 0. In view of (1.4), we\nhave \u2202q A\u03b7 (s, q, t, x) = \u03b7q \u2212 p(s), where\n(x(\u03c3), p(\u03c3)) = (x(\u03c3), \u2202v L(\u03c3, x(\u03c3), \u1e8b(\u03c3))) : [s, t] \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M\nis the Hamiltonian trajectory associated to the unique minimizing curve x(\u03c3) \u2208 \u03a3m (s, q, t, x).\nUniqueness follows from the differentiability of A\u03b7 (s, ., t, x) at q, see (1.4). We have\n(x(s), p(s)) = (q, duq + \u03b7q ) \u2282 G\u03b7,u\nand therefore\n\u0001\n(x(t), p(t)) = \u03c6ts (q, duq + \u03b7q ) \u2208 \u03c6ts G\u03b7,u|N .\n\nSince the functions A\u03b7 (s, ., t, x), x \u2208 M are equi-semi-concave, they are all K-semi-concave for\nsome K. It follows that the function u has a K-sub-differential at each point of N , and therefore\nat each point of N\u0304 . We conclude using (A.7) that the function u is differentiable on N\u0304 , and that\nthe map q 7\u2212\u2192 duq is Lipschitz on N\u0304 . As a consequence, we have\nG\u03b7,u|N\u0304 = G\u03b7,u|N ,\nand this set is a Lipshitz graph over N\u0304 . Still exploiting (1.4), we get that the function A\u03b7 (s, q, t, .)\nis differentiable at x, and satisfies \u2202x A\u03b7 (s, q, t, x) = p(t) \u2212 \u03b7x . Noticing that the function v \u2212\nA\u03b7 (s, q, t, .) has a local maximum at x, we conclude that dvx = p(t) \u2212 \u03b7x if v is differentiable at x,\nand therefore that\n\u0001\n(x, \u03b7x + dvx ) = (x(t), p(t)) \u2208 \u03c6ts G\u03b7,u|N\nfor each point\nof differentiability x \u2208 V of v. In other words, we have the inclusion G\u03b7,v|V \u2282\n\u0001\n\u03c6ts G\u03b7,u|N , hence\n\u0001\n\u0001\nG\u03b7,v|V \u2282 \u03c6ts G\u03b7,u|N = \u03c6ts G\u03b7,u|N\u0304 .\n\n11\n\n\f(2.8) Let G = Gc,u be a fixed point of \u03a6. And let n < m be two relative integers. Following\nFathi, we say that a curve x(t) : [n, m] \u2212\u2192 M is calibrated by G if\nZ m\nu(x(n)) +\nL(t, x(t), \u1e8b(t)) \u2212 cx(t) (\u1e8b(t))dt = Tcn\u2212m u(x(m)),\nn\n\nnote, since u is a fixed point of \u03a6, that Tcn\u2212m u = u + (m \u2212 n)\u03b1(c), where \u03b1(c) is a constant (which,\nas we will see below depends on c but not on u). A consequence of the addendum in (2.7) is\nthat the curve x(t) is calibrated by G if the curve (x(t), p(t) = \u2202v L(t, x(t), \u1e8b(t))) is a Hamiltonian\ntrajectory satisfying (x(m), p(m)) \u2208 \u1e20. Conversely, if x(t) is calibrated by G, then (x(k), p(k)) \u2208 G\nfor each integer k \u2208 [n, m[.\n(2.9)\n\nThe following Corollary is the reason why we have called the elements of P overlapping.\n\nCorollary\n\nAll overlapping pseudographs G \u2208 P satisfy \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6(G) = M.\n\n\u0001\nProof. We have \u03a6(G) \u2282 \u03c6(G), and \u03c0(\u03a6(G)) is dense in M , so that \u03c0 \u03a6(G) = M.\n(2.10) It is useful, still following Fathi, to define \"dual\" concepts. We define the dual LaxOleinik operator associated to a closed form \u03b7 by the expression\n\u0001\nT\u0306\u03b7 u(x) = max u(q) \u2212 A\u03b7 (0, x; 1, q) , u \u2208 C(M, R)\nq\u2208M\n\nand we associate to this operator a mapping \u03a6\u0306 : P\u0306 \u2212\u2192 P\u0306 by the expression \u03a6\u0306(Gc,\u2212u ) = Gc,T\u0306c (\u2212u) \u2208\nP\u0306. We have\n\n\u03a6\u0306(\u011e) \u2282 \u03c6\u22121 (\u011e)\n\nif \u011e \u2208 P\u0306. We denote by V\u0306 the set of fixed points of \u03a6\u0306. Let \u011e = Gc,\u2212u be a fixed point of \u03a6\u0306, and\nlet n < m be two relative integers. We say that a curve x(t) : [n, m] \u2212\u2192 M is calibrated by \u011e if\nZ m\nL(t, x(t), \u1e8b(t)) \u2212 cx(t) (\u1e8b(t))dt = T\u0306cm\u2212n u(x(n)).\nu(x(m)) \u2212\nn\n\n(2.11)\n\nIt is useful to collect a few remarks. We have\nT\u0306c Tc u 6 u\n\nfor all continuous functions u. Writing T\u0306cn+1 Tcn+1 u = T\u0306cn T\u0306c Tc Tcn u, we observe that T\u0306cn Tcn u is a\nnon-increasing sequence of functions. Conversely, Tcn T\u0306cn u is non-decreasing for each continuous\nfunction u.\n3\n\nAubry-Mather sets\n\nWe use the overlapping pseudographs to recover various invariant sets introduced by Mather,\nand to study their major properties. We also establish the equivalence between the different\ndefinitions of the same sets given in the literature. Most of the section follows Fathi [15], with\nsome minor variations.\n(3.1) Proposition There exists a function \u03b1 : H 1 (M, R) \u2212\u2192 R such that, for each continuous\nfunction u and each form \u03b7 of cohomology c, the sequence T\u03b7n u(x) + n\u03b1(c), n > 1 of continuous\nfunctions is equi-bounded and equi-Lipschitz. The function c 7\u2212\u2192 \u03b1(c) is convex and super-linear.\nMore precisely, there exists a constant K(c), which does not depend on the continuous function u,\nsuch that\nmin u \u2212 K(c) 6 Tcn u(x) + n\u03b1(c) 6 max u + K(c).\nfor each n \u2208 N and x \u2208 M .\n12\n\n\fProof. Let us fix a cohomology class c, and define the sequences\nMn (c) := max Tcn (0)(x) and mn (c) := min Tcn (0)(x),\nx\u2208M\n\nx\u2208M\n\nwhere 0 is the zero function on M . Since the functions\nAppendix A, there exists a constant K such that\n\nTcn (0), n\n\n> 1, are equi-semi-concave, see\n\n0 6 Mn (c) \u2212 mn (c) 6 K\nfor n > 1. We claim that Mn+m (c) 6 Mn (c) + Mm (c). This follows from the inequalities\nTcm+n (0)(x) = Tcm (Tcn (0))(x) 6 Tcm (Mn (c))(x) 6 Mn (c) + Tcm (0)(x).\nHence by a classical result on subadditive sequences, we have lim Mn (c)/n = inf Mn (c)/n. We denote by \u2212\u03b1(c) this limit. In the same way, the sequence \u2212mn (c) is subadditive, hence mn (c)/n \u2212\u2192\nsup mn (c)/n. This limit is also \u2212\u03b1(c) because 0 6 Mn (c)\u2212mn (c) 6 K. Note that m1 (c) 6 \u2212\u03b1(c) 6\nM1 (c), so that \u03b1(c) is indeed a finite number. We have, for all n > 1,\n\u2212K \u2212 n\u03b1(c) 6 mn (c) 6 \u2212n\u03b1(c) 6 Mn (c) 6 K \u2212 n\u03b1(c).\nNow far all u \u2208 C(M, R), n \u2208 N and x \u2208 M , we have\nmin u \u2212 K 6 min u + mn (c) + n\u03b1(c) 6 Tcn u(x) + n\u03b1(c) 6 max u + Mn (c) + n\u03b1(c) 6 max u + K,\nM\n\nM\n\nM\n\nM\n\nand we obtain the first conclusion of the Proposition. The explicit definition of the value mn (c) is\nZ n\nmn (c) =\nmin\nL(s, \u03b3(s), \u03b3\u0307(s)) \u2212 c\u03b3(s) (\u03b3\u0307(s))ds.\n1\n\u03b3\u2208C ([0,n],M)\n\n0\n\nAs a consequence, the function c 7\u2212\u2192 mn (c) is concave, as a minimum of linear functions. Hence\neach of the functions c 7\u2212\u2192 mn (c)/n is concave, so that the limit \u2212\u03b1(c) is concave, and the function\n\u03b1(c) is convex. Since \u03b1(c) > K \u2212m1(c), it is enough to prove that \u2212m1 is super-linear as a function\nof c in order to prove that \u03b1 is. For each homology class h \u2208 H1 (M, Z), let \u03b3h : [0, 1] \u2212\u2192 M be a\nclosed curve representing this homology class. We have\nZ 1\n\u2212m1 (c) > c(h) \u2212\nL(s, \u03b3h (s), \u03b3\u0307h (s))ds.\n0\n\nThis implies that \u2212m1 , hence \u03b1, is super-linear. Indeed, in order that a function f : Rn \u2212\u2192 R is\nsuper-linear, it is enough that there exists, for each y \u2208 Zn , a value ay such that f (x) > y * x \u2212 ay\nfor each x.\n\n(3.2)\n\nProposition.\n\nLet us fix a closed form \u03b7 and a continuous function u. Let us set\n\u0001\nv := lim inf T\u03b7n (u) + n\u03b1([\u03b7]) ,\nn\u2212\u2192\u221e\n\nthen v is a fixed point of T\u03b7 + \u03b1 hence G\u03b7,v is a fixed point of \u03a6.\n\nProof. The one-form \u03b7 is fixed once and for all in this proof, we omit the subscript \u03b7, and\ndenote by \u03b1 the number \u03b1([\u03b7]). Let us first prove that T v + \u03b1 6 v. In order to do so, we fix\nx \u2208 M and consider an increasing sequence nk of integers such that T nk u(x) + nk \u03b1 \u2212\u2192 v(x). Let\nqk be a point such that T nk u(x) = T nk \u22121 u(qk ) + A(0, qk ; 1, x) or equivalently, T nk u(x) + nk \u03b1 =\nT nk \u22121 u(qk ) + (nk \u2212 1)\u03b1 + \u03b1 + A(0, qk ; 1, x). We can suppose that the sequence qk has a limit q.\nTaking the lim inf in the equality above gives\nv(x) > v(q) + A(0, q, 1, x) + \u03b1 > T v(x) + \u03b1\nwhere we have used the equi-continuity of the functions T n u, n \u2208 N.\nIn order to prove that T v + \u03b1 > v, just notice that T n u(x) 6 T n\u22121 u(q) + A(0, q; 1, x) for each\nq and x, or equivalently that T n u(x) + n\u03b1 6 T n\u22121 u(q) + (n \u2212 1)\u03b1 + A(0, q; 1, x) + \u03b1 and take the\nliminf.\n\n13\n\n\f(3.3) Lemma Let us fix a closed form \u03b7 of cohomology c. Let M \u2282 C(M, R) be a family of\nfixed points of the Lax-Oleinik operator T\u03b7 + \u03b1(c). Assume that the infimum v(x) = inf u\u2208M u(x)\nis finite for one (and then each) x \u2208 M . Then the function v is a fixed point of T\u03b7 + \u03b1(c).\nProof. For all functions u \u2208 M and all points x and y in M , we have u(x) 6 u(y)+A\u03b7 (0, y; 1, x)+\n\u03b1(c). It follows that v(x) 6 v(y) + A\u03b7 (0, y; 1, x) + \u03b1(c), so that\n\u0001\nv(x) 6 inf v(y) + A\u03b7 (0, y; 1, x) + \u03b1(c).\ny\n\nIn order to prove the other inequality, let us fix \u01eb > 0, take a function u \u2208 M such that u(x) 6\nv(x) + \u01eb, and consider a point y \u2208 M such that u(x) = u(y) + A\u03b7 (0, y; 1, x) + \u03b1(c). We obtain\nv(x) > u(x) \u2212 \u01eb > u(y) + A\u03b7 (0, y; 1, x) + \u03b1(c) \u2212 \u01eb > v(y) + A\u03b7 (0, y; 1, x) + \u03b1(c) \u2212 \u01eb.\nAs a consequence, we have v(x) > T\u03b7 v(y)\u03b1(c) \u2212 \u01eb, and, since this holds for all \u01eb > 0, the desired\ninequality follows.\n\n(3.4) Fixed points of the Lax-Oleinik operator Tc + \u03b1(c) will be called weak KAM solutions,\nfollowing Fathi. We denote by V \u2282 P the set of fixed points of \u03a6, and Vc \u2282 Pc the set of fixed\npoints of \u03a6 of cohomology c. Sometimes, we will also denote by VC the set of fixed points of \u03a6\nwhose cohomology belongs to the subset C \u2282 H 1 (M, R). The set Vc is non-empty for each c. If\nG \u2208 V, then it follows from (2.6) that\nG \u2282 \u03c6(G).\nIt is then natural to define the set\n\u0128(G) =\n\n\\\n\n\u03c6\u2212n (\u1e20),\n\nn\u2208N\n\nwhich is a non-empty compact \u03c6-invariant subset of T \u2217 M . We also define\nI(G) = \u03c0(\u0128(G)) \u2282 M.\nMore generally, for each G \u2208 P, we define the set\n\\\n\u0001\n\u0128(G) :=\n\u03c6\u2212n \u03a6n (G) .\nn\u2208N\n\nSince \u03c6\u2212n (\u03a6n (G)), is a non-increasing sequence of compact sets, the set \u0128(G) is compact and not\nempty for each G \u2208 P.\n(3.5) For each G \u2208 V, we define the set M\u0303(G) as the union of the supports of invariant measures\nof \u03c6|\u0128(G) . If G \u2208 V and G \u2032 \u2208 V have the same cohomology c, then it is known that\nM\u0303(G) \u2282 \u0128(G \u2032 )\nhence M\u0303(G) = M\u0303(G \u2032 ). As a consequence, the set M\u0303, usually called the Mather set, depends only\non the cohomology c. It will be denoted by\nM\u0303(c),\nand as usual, we will denote by M(c) the projection \u03c0(M\u0303(c)). We also define the Aubry set in a\nusual way by\n\\\n\u0128(G)\n\u00c3(c) =\nG\u2208Vc\n\nand A(c) = \u03c0(\u00c3(c)). The Ma\u00f1\u00e9 set is defined by\n\u00d1 (c) =\n\n[\n\nG\u2208Vc\n\n14\n\n\u0128(G)\n\n\fand N (c) = \u03c0(\u00d1 (c)). A bigger set will be useful in some occasions, defined by\n[\n\u1ebc(c) =\n\u0128(G),\nG\u2208Oc\n\nwhere Oc is as defined in (2.5). As an intersection of Lipschitz graphs, the Aubry set \u00c3(c) is a\nLipschitz graph over A(c). Note however that the Ma\u00f1\u00e9 set is not a Graph in general. The sets\nM\u0303(c) \u2282 \u00c3(c) \u2282 \u00d1 (c) \u2282 \u1ebc(c)\nare compact and invariant under \u03c6. The compactness of \u00d1 (c) and \u1ebc(c) is mentioned here for\ncompleteness, it will be proved later in this section, in (3.12) and (3.13) below. These Lemma also\nprove that the Ma\u00f1\u00e9 set is indeed the set of orbits called c-minimizing by Mather and semi-static\nby Ma\u00f1\u00e9, and that the set \u1ebc is the set of minimizing orbits, called G\u0303 in [3].\n(3.6)\n\nIt is possible to associate to each dual fixed point \u011e \u2208 V\u0306 the invariant set\n\u0010 \u0011\n\\\n\u0128(\u011e) =\n\u03c6n \u011e\nn\u2208N\n\nand its projection I(\u011e) on M . The following is due to Fathi, [17].\nProposition. Let us fix a cohomology c, and consider pseudographs G \u2208 Vc and \u011e \u2208 V\u0306c . The\n \u0303 \u011e is non-empty, compact and invariant by \u03c6. In addition, this set intersects the Aubry set\nset G \u2227\n\u00c3(c), and satisfies\n \u0303 \u011e \u2282 \u0128(G) \u2229 \u0128(\u011e)\nG\u2227\nso that\nG \u2227 \u011e \u2282 I(G) \u2229 I(\u011e).\nFurthermore, for each pseudograph G \u2208 Vc , there exists a pseudograph \u011e \u2208 V\u0306c such that\nG \u2227 \u011e = I(G) = I(\u011e).\nIn a symmetric way, for each pseudograph \u011e \u2208 V\u0306c , there exists a pseudograph G \u2208 Vc such that\nthis relation holds. As a consequence, we have\n\\\n\\\n\u00c3(c) =\n\u0128(G) =\n\u0128(\u011e)\nG\u2208Vc\n\nand\n\u00d1 (c) =\n\n[\n\n\u011e\u2208V\u0306c\n\n\u0128(G) =\n\nG\u2208Vc\n\n[\n\n\u0128(\u011e).\n\n\u011e\u2208V\u0306c\n\n \u0303 \u011e is compact and not empty, see (2.3). Let us\nProof. We have already proved that the set G \u2227\nprove that it is invariant. In order to do so, we consider a weak KAM solution u and a dual weak\nKAM solution \u016d such that G = Gc,u and \u011e = Gc,\u016d . Let (x(t), p(t)) : R \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M be an orbit of the\n \u0303 \u011e. Clearly, both u and \u016d are differentiable at x(0),\nHamiltonian flow, such that (x(0), p(0)) \u2208 G \u2227\nand p(0) = cx(0) + dux(0) . For each m 6 n in N, we have\nu(x(n)) = min u(x) \u2212 Ac (m, x, n, x(n)) + (n \u2212 m)\u03b1(c)\nx\u2208M\n\n6 u(x(m)) + Ac (m, x(m), n, x(n)) + (n \u2212 m)\u03b1(c).\nOn the other hand, we have (x(0), p(0)) \u2208 \u011e hence, in view of (2.7),\n\u016d(x(n)) = \u016d(x(m)) + Ac (m, x(m), n, x(n)) + (n \u2212 m)\u03b1(c).\n15\n\n\fAs a consequence, the sequence n 7\u2212\u2192 (u \u2212 \u016d)(x(n)) is non-increasing on N. Since its initial value\n(u \u2212 \u016d)(x(0)) has been chosen to be a minimum of the function u \u2212 \u016d, the sequence must be\nconstant, so that x(n) is a point of G \u2227 \u011e for each n > 0. A symmetric argument shows that\nthis is also true for n 6 0. In addition, we obtain that the inequality u(x(n)) 6 u(x(m)) +\nAc (m, x(m), n, x(n)) + (n \u2212 m)\u03b1(c) is in fact an equality for 0 6 m 6 n. Since this formula is true\nin view of (2.7) for m 6 n 6 0 in Z, we obtain that, for all m 6 n in Z,\nu(x(n)) = u(x(m)) + Ac (m, x(m), n, x(n)) + (n \u2212 m)\u03b1(c).\nIn other words, the curve x(t) is calibrated by G and by \u011e, see (2.8). This implies that (x(n), p(n)) \u2208\n \u0303 \u011e. This proves that G \u2227\n \u0303 \u011e\nG \u2229 \u011e for each n \u2208 Z, and, since x(n) \u2208 G \u2227 \u011e, we get (x(n), p(n)) \u2208 G \u2227\nis invariant by \u03c6 and contained in I(G) and in I(\u011e).\nEvery compact invariant set of \u0128(G) carries an invariant measure. As a consequence, every\ncompact invariant set of \u0128(G) intersects the Mather set M\u0303(c), see (3.5). Since M\u0303(c) \u2282 \u00c3(c),\n \u0303 \u011e, which is a compact and invariant subset of \u0128(G), intersects \u00c3(c). Let us now\nthe set G \u2227\nfix the Pseudograph Gc,u \u2208 Vc , and prove the existence of a pseudograph \u011e \u2208 V\u0306c such that\nG \u2227 \u011e = I(G) = I(\u011e). In order to do so, we set\n\u016d := lim T\u0306cn u \u2212 n\u03b1(c) = lim T\u0306cn Tcn u.\nn\u2212\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2212\u2192\u221e\n\nIt follows from (2.11) and (3.1) that the limit exists and that \u016d 6 u. Let (x(t), p(t)) : R \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M\nbe a Hamiltonian orbit satisfying (x(0), p(0)) \u2208 \u0128(G). The orbit x(t) is then calibrated by G, see\n(2.8), so that the relation\nu(x(n)) \u2212 u(x(m)) = Ac (m, x(m); n, x(n)) + (n \u2212 m)\u03b1(c)\nholds for all m 6 n in Z. It is clear from this relation that, for each n \u2208 N,\nT\u0306cn u(x(0)) > u(x(n)) \u2212 Ac (0, x(0); n, x(n)) = u(x(0)) + n\u03b1(c),\nSo that T\u0306cn u(x(0)) \u2212 n\u03b1(c) = u(x(0)), hence \u016d = u on I(G). As a consequence, the set of points\nminimizing u \u2212 \u016d contains I(G). Since we have already proved that this set is contained in I(G),\nwe can conclude, as desired, that\nGc,u \u2227 Gc,\u016d = I(G).\nSetting u\u2032 = lim Tcn \u016d + n\u03b1(c) = lim Tcn T\u0306cn \u016d, the same proof gives that\nGc,u\u2032 \u2227 Gc,\u016d = I(Gc,\u016d ).\nWe claim that u\u2032 = u, so that we have proved\nGc,u \u2227 Gc,\u016d = I(Gc,u ) = I(Gc,\u016d ).\nIn order to prove that u\u2032 = u, we first recall that \u016d 6 u, so that Tcn \u016d + n\u03b1(c) 6 Tcn u + n\u03b1(c) = u,\nand u\u2032 6 u. On the other hand, for each \u01eb > 0, there exists N \u2208 N such that T\u0306cN u \u2212 N \u03b1(c) 6 \u016d + \u01eb,\nhence\nu\u2032 > lim Tcn T\u0306cN u + (n \u2212 N )\u03b1(c) \u2212 \u01eb > lim Tcn\u2212N u + (n \u2212 N )\u03b1(c) \u2212 \u01eb = u \u2212 \u01eb.\nn\u2212\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2212\u2192\u221e\n\nWe have proved that u\u2032 = u.\nThe pairs (u, \u016d) of fixed points of Tc + \u03b1(c) and T\u0306c \u2212 \u03b1(c) which satisfy\n\u016d = lim T\u0306cn u \u2212 n\u03b1(c) ; u = lim Tcn \u016d + n\u03b1(c)\nare conjugate in the sense of Fathi.\n16\n\n\f(3.7) Proposition.\nand proper.\n\nThe restriction to V of the function c : P \u2212\u2192 H 1 (M, R) is continuous\n\nProof. Let us consider a compact subset C of H 1 (M, R). The Family of Hamiltonians H(t, x, cx +\np), c \u2208 C, is a uniform family of Hamiltonians, see Appendix B. As a consequence, the associated\nfunctions Ac (0, .; 1, .), c \u2208 C form an equi-semi-concave family of functions on M \u00d7 M . As a consequence, the functions Ac (0, x; 1, .), c \u2208 C, x \u2208 M form an equi-semi-concave family of functions\non M , see Appendix A. It follows that the functions u(x) + Ac (0, x; 1, .), c \u2208 C, x \u2208 M also form\nan equi-semi-concave family, hence that the functions minx u(x) + Ac (0, x; 1, .), c \u2208 C form an\nequi-semi-concave family. As a consequence, the set \u03a6(PC ) is relatively compact. Since the set\nVC is obviously closed, and contained in \u03a6(PC ), it is compact.\nWe have proved the following Lemma, which is interesting in itself:\nLemma.\n(3.8)\n\nIf C is a compact subset of H 1 (M, R), the set \u03a6(PC ) is equi-semi-concave.\n\nFollowing Mather, we will use the function\nhc (x, y) := lim inf Anc (x, y) + n\u03b1(c).\nn\u2212\u2192\u221e\n\nIn view of (3.2), the function hc (x, .) is a fixed point of Tc + \u03b1(c). Similarly, the function \u2212hc (., y)\nis a fixed point of T\u0306c \u2212 \u03b1(c). Let us recall here some basic properties of the function hc .\n\u2022 For each x, y, z \u2208 M and c \u2208 H 1 (M, R), we have the triangle inequality hc (x, y) + hc (y, z) >\nhc (x, z).\n\u2022 For each x, y \u2208 M and c \u2208 H 1 (M, R), we have hc (x, y) + hc (y, x) > hc (x, x) > 0,\n\u2022 For each compact set C \u2282 H 1 (M, R), the set of functions hc : M \u00d7 M \u2212\u2192 R, c \u2208 C, is\nequi-semi-concave.\n(3.9)\n\nProposition.\n\nIf the pseudograph Gc,u is a fixed point of \u03a6, then we have\nu(y) \u2212 u(x) 6 hc (x, y)\n\nfor each x and y. In addition,\nu(x) = min u(y) + hc (y, x) = min u(a) + hc (a, x).\ny\u2208M\n\na\u2208A(c)\n\nProof. We have, for each n, u = Tcn u + n\u03b1(c). As a consequence, for each n,\n\u0001\nu(x) = min u(y) + Ac (0, y; n, x) + n\u03b1(c) .\ny\u2208M\n\nWe obtain the inequality u(x) 6 u(y) + Ac (0, y; n, x) + n\u03b1(c) and, by taking the liminf, u(x) 6\nu(y) + hc (y, x). In order to obtain the first equality, we consider a point yn \u2208 M such that\nu(x) = u(yn ) + Ac (0, yn ; n, x) + n\u03b1(c).\nWe consider an increasing sequence nk of integers such that the subsequence ynk has a limit y,\nand refine this subsequence in such a way that the subsequence Ac (0, y, nk , x) has a limit l. We\nhave\nu(x) = u(y) + l > u(y) + hc (y, x).\nCumulated with the previously shown inequality, this proves the first equality in the statement.\nIn order to prove the second equality, notice that the set of points y which minimize the function\nu(.) + hc (., x) is precisely the set G \u2227 Gc,\u2212hc (.,x) , and that Gc,\u2212hc (.,x) \u2208 V\u0306c . By (3.6), the set\nG \u2227 Gc,\u2212hc (.,x) intersects A(c).\n\n17\n\n\f(3.10)\n\nCorollary.\n\nFor each x and y in M and c \u2208 H 1 (M, R), we have\n\nhc (x, y) = min hc (x, z) + hc (z, y) = min hc (x, a) + hc (a, y).\nz\u2208M\n\na\u2208A(c)\n\nThe following result connects our definition of the Aubry set to the one of Mather.\n(3.11)\n\nProposition.\n\nThe Aubry set A(c) is the set of points x such that hc (x, x) = 0.\n\nProof. Let us consider a Hamiltonian trajectory (x(t), p(t)) : R \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M such that (x(0), p(0)) \u2208\n\u00c3(c). This trajectory is calibrated by each fixed point of Tc + \u03b1(c), so in particular by hc (x(0), .).\nConsequently, we have\nhc (x(0), x(n)) \u2212 hc (x(0), x(0)) = Ac (0, x(0); n, x(n)) + n\u03b1(c).\nTaking a subsequence such that x(n) has a limit x, and then a subsequence such that Ac (0, x(0); n, x)+\nn\u03b1(c) is converging to a limit l > hc (x(0), x), we get, at the limit,\nhc (x(0), x) \u2212 hc (x(0), x(0)) > hc (x(0), x)\nthus hc (x(0), x(0)) 6 0 and then hc (x(0), x(0)) = 0. We have proved that the function hc (x, x)\nvanishes on A(c).\nConversely, let us assume that hc (x, x) = 0. Then there exists an increasing sequence nk of\nintegers and a sequence of trajectories (xk (t), pk (t)) : [0, nk ] \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M such that x(0) = x(nk ) = x\nand\nZ nk\nL(t, xk (t), \u1e8bk (t)) \u2212 cxk (t) (\u1e8bk (t)) + \u03b1(c) dt = Ac (0, x; nk , x) + nk \u03b1(c) \u2212\u2192 0.\n0\n\nLet yk : [\u2212nk , nk ] \u2212\u2192 M be the curve such that yk (t) = xk (t + nk ) for \u2212nk 6 t 6 0 and\nyk (t) = xk (t) for t > 0. The sequence yk is C 2 -bounded hence, by taking a subsequence, we\ncan suppose that yk is converging with its derivative, uniformly on compact sets, to a limit\ny(t) : R \u2212\u2192 M . We claim that this limit y is calibrated by each fixed points of Tc + \u03b1(c). Let u\nbe a such a fixed point. We have, for each n \u2208 N and k large enough,\n0 > u(yk (n)) \u2212 u(yk (\u2212n)) \u2212 Ac (\u2212n, yk (\u2212n); n, yk (n)) \u2212 2n\u03b1(c)\n= u(yk (nk )) \u2212 u(yk (\u2212nk )) \u2212 Ac (\u2212nk , yk (\u2212nk ); nk , yk (n)) \u2212 2nk \u03b1(c)\n\u0001\n\u2212 u(yk (nk )) \u2212 u(yk (n)) \u2212 Ac (n, yk (n); nk , yk (n)) \u2212 (nk \u2212 n)\u03b1(c)\n\n\u0001\n\u2212 u(yk (\u2212n)) \u2212 u(yk (\u2212nk )) \u2212 Ac (\u2212nk , yk (\u2212nk ); \u2212n, yk (\u2212n)) \u2212 (nk \u2212 n)\u03b1(c)\n> u(yk (nk )) \u2212 u(yk (\u2212nk )) \u2212 Ac (\u2212nk , yk (\u2212nk ); nk , yk (n)) \u2212 2nk \u03b1(c)\n= \u2212Ac (\u2212nk , x; nk , x) \u2212 2nk \u03b1(c) = \u22122Ac (0, x; nk , x) \u2212 2nk \u03b1(c).\nFor fixed n, we now take the limit k \u2212\u2192 \u221e, and get that\nu(y(n)) \u2212 u(y(\u2212n)) = Ac (\u2212n, y(\u2212n); n, y(n)) + 2n\u03b1(c).\nConsequently, the curve y(t) is calibrated by u. Since this holds for each weak KAM solution u,\nwe have x = y(0) \u2208 A(c).\n\nThe following well-known result connects our definition of the Ma\u00f1\u00e9 set with the usual one,\nand implies its compactness.\n\n18\n\n\f(3.12) Lemma The following properties are equivalent for a continuous curve P (t) = (x(t), p(t)) :\nR \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M .\n(i) The curve P (t) is a Hamiltonian trajectory and P (Z) \u2282 \u00d1 (c).\n(ii) The curve P (t) satisfies p(t) = \u2202v L(t, x(t), \u1e8b(t)) and there exists Gc,u \u2208 Vc such that, for\neach m > n in Z, we have\nZ m\nu(x(m)) \u2212 u(x(n)) =\nL(t, x(t), \u1e8b(t)) \u2212 cx(t) (\u1e8b(t))dt + (m \u2212 n)\u03b1(c).\nn\n\n(iii) The curve P (t) satisfies p(t) = \u2202v L(t, x(t), \u1e8b(t)) and for each m > n in Z, we have\nZ m\nL(t, x(t), \u1e8b(t)) \u2212 cx(t) (\u1e8b(t))dt + (m \u2212 n)\u03b1(c) = min Ac (0, x(n); l, x(m)) + l\u03b1(c).\nl\u2208N,l>0\n\nn\n\nProof.

For each m > 0, since\nP (m) \u2208 Gc,um , we have\nZ m\nL(t, x(t), \u1e8b(t)) \u2212 cx(t) (\u1e8b(t))dt.\num (x(m)) \u2212 u0 (x(0)) =\n0\n\nOn the other hand, for each n 6 0, we can find by minimization a curve yn (t) : [n, 0] \u2212\u2192 M such\nthat yn (0) = x(0) and\nu0 (yn (0)) \u2212 un (yn (n)) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nL(t, yn (t), \u1e8fn (t)) \u2212 cyn (t) (\u1e8fn (t))dt.\n\nn\n\nThere exists a subsequence nk such that the curves ynk (t) converge, uniformly on compact sets,\nto a limit y(t) : (\u2212\u221e, 0] \u2212\u2192 M . By (1.3), this curve satisfies, for all n 6 0,\nu0 (y(0)) \u2212 un (y(n)) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nL(t, y(t), \u1e8f(t)) \u2212 cy(t) (\u1e8f(t))dt.\nn\n\nHence, for n 6 0 6 m, we have\nZ\nZ 0\nL(t, y(t), \u1e8f(t)) \u2212 cy(t) (\u1e8f(t))dt +\num (x(m)) \u2212 un (y(n)) =\n\nm\n\nL(t, x(t), \u1e8b(t)) \u2212 cx(t) (\u1e8b(t))dt.\n\n0\n\nn\n\nAs a consequence, the curve obtained by gluing y on R\u2212 and x on R+ is the projection of a\nHamiltonian trajectory, which, by Cauchy-Lipschitz uniqueness, has to be P (t). In other words,\nwe have proved that x(t) = y(t) on R\u2212 . The relation of calibration is now established.\n(iii) \u21d2 (ii). Let P (t) be a curve satisfying (iii). Then we have, for m > n > k,\nZ m\nL(t, x(t), \u1e8b(t)) \u2212 cx(t) (\u1e8b(t))dt + (m \u2212 n)\u03b1(c)\nn\n\n= Ac (k, x(k); m, x(m)) + (m \u2212 k)\u03b1(c) \u2212 Ac (k, x(k); n, x(n)) + (n \u2212 k)\u03b1(c).\n20\n\n\fLet us denote by unk the function\nunk (x) = Ac (k, x(k); n, x) + (n \u2212 k)\u03b1(c),\nwe obviously have Tcm\u2212n unk + (m \u2212 n)\u03b1(c) = um\nk for m > n > k. By diagonal extraction, we find\nan increasing sequence of integers nk such that un\u2212nk has a limit un for each n as k \u2212\u2192 \u221e. We\nthen have Tcm\u2212n un + (m \u2212 n)\u03b1(c) = um for each m > n, so that Gc,un \u2208 O. In addition, we have\nZ m\nL(t, x(t), \u1e8b(t)) \u2212 cx(t) (\u1e8b(t))dt + (m \u2212 n)\u03b1(c) = um (x(m)) \u2212 un (x(n)).\nn\n\n(ii) \u21d2 (iii) is clear.\n(3.14) Lemma For each P \u2208 \u1ebc(c), the orbit \u03c6n (P ) is \u03b1-asymptotic and \u03c9-asymptotic to the\nAubry set \u00c3(c). As a consequence, the Mather set M\u0303(c) is the closure of the union of the supports\nof the invariant measures of the action of \u03c6 on \u1ebc(c)\nProof. Let P (t) = (x(t), p(t)) be the Hamiltonian orbit of P . Let un , n \u2208 Z be a sequence of\ncontinuous functions such that, for m > n, we have um = Tcm\u2212n un + (m \u2212 n)\u03b1(c) and\nZ m\num (x(m)) \u2212 un (x(n)) =\nL(t, x(t), \u1e8b(t)) \u2212 cx(t) (\u1e8b(t))dt + (m \u2212 n)\u03b1(c).\nn\n\nThe sequence um , m \u2208 Z is equi-semi-concave, hence equi-Lipschitz. Together with (3.1), this\nimplies that this sequence is equi-bounded. If v is a weak KAM solution, that is a fixed point of\nTc \u2212 \u03b1(c), we have, for m > n,\nZ m\nL(t, x(t), \u1e8b(t)) \u2212 cx(t) (\u1e8b(t))dt + (m \u2212 n)\u03b1(c)\nv(x(m)) \u2212 v(x(n)) 6\nn\n\nIt follows that the sequence n 7\u2212\u2192 un (x(n)) \u2212 v(x(n)) is non-decreasing and bounded, so that\nit has a limit l as n \u2212\u2192 \u2212\u221e. Let us now consider an increasing sequence nk of integers such\nthat the sequence P (t \u2212 nk ) converges, uniformly on compact sets, to a limit Z(t) = (y(t), z(t))\nwhich is a Hamiltonian trajectory. Extracting a subsequence in nk , we can suppose that there\nexists a sequence wn of continuous functions on M such that un\u2212nk \u2212\u2192 wn uniformly, for each\nn, as k \u2212\u2192 \u221e. Then, the sequence wn satisfies Tcm\u2212n wn = wm for m > n. In addition, we have\nwn (y(n)) \u2212 v(y(n)) = l and, for m > n,\nZ m\nL(t, y(t), \u1e8f(t)) \u2212 cy(t) (\u1e8f(t))dt + (m \u2212 n)\u03b1(c).\nwm (y(m)) \u2212 wn (y(n)) =\nn\n\nIt follows that, for m > n,\nv(x(m)) \u2212 v(x(n)) =\n\nZ\n\nm\n\nL(t, y(t), \u1e8f(t)) \u2212 cy(t) (\u1e8f(t))dt + (m \u2212 n)\u03b1(c)\n\nn\n\nwhich implies that Z(Z) \u2208 \u0128(Gc,v ). Since this holds for all weak KAM solutions v, we obtain that\nZ(Z) \u2208 \u00c3(c). We have proved that the trajectory P (t) is \u03b1-asymptotic to \u00c3(c). Similarly, one\ncan prove that it is also \u03c9-asymptotic to \u00c3(c). This implies that the invariant measures of the\naction of \u03c6 on \u1ebc(c) are supported on \u00c3(c).\n\n4\n\nStatic classes and heteroclinics\n\nIn this section, we see that there is a natural partition of the Aubry set in compact invariant\nsubsets, which we call static classes, following the terminology of Ma\u00f1\u00e9. This partition was first\nconsidered by Mather in [24]. We also discuss the existence of heteroclinic orbits between these\nstatic classes, extending to the non-autonomous case results of Fathi, Contreras and Paternain, see\n[18] and [11]. This survey is also an occasion to introduce several technical lemmas and notations\nto be used later.\n21\n\n\f(4.1)\n\nLemma.\n\nLet x and y be two points in M . The following properties are equivalent:\n\n(i) The points x and y are in A(c) and the function z 7\u2212\u2192 hc (x, z) \u2212 hc (y, z) is constant on\nA(c).\n(ii) hc (x, y) + hc (y, x) = 0.\n(iii) The points x and y are in A(c) and, for each pair (G, \u011e) \u2208 Vc \u00d7 V\u0306c , either the set G \u2227 \u011e\ncontains x and y or it contains neither x nor y.\nIf x and y satisfy these properties, we have, for each z \u2208 M , hc (x, z) = hc (x, y) + hc (y, z).\nProof. i \u21d2 ii. Assuming i, we evaluate the constant function at x and y and get hc (x, x) \u2212\nhc (y, x) = hc (x, y) \u2212 hc (y, y), hence hc (x, y) + hc (y, x) = 0.\nii \u21d2 iii. We have hc (x, x) 6 hc (x, y) + hc (y, x) = 0 hence x \u2208 A(c). Similarly, y \u2208 A(c). Let\nus consider G = Gc,u \u2208 Vc and \u011e = Gc,\u016d \u2208 V\u0306c such that x \u2208 G \u2227 \u011e (such a pair exists because\nx \u2208 A(c)). We have to prove that y \u2208 G \u2227 \u011e. We have the inequalities u(y) 6 u(x) + hc (x, y) and\n\u016d(y) > \u016d(x) \u2212 hc (y, x). We obtain the inequality\n(u \u2212 \u016d)(y) 6 (u \u2212 \u016d)(x) + hc (x, y) + hc (y, x).\nAs a consequence, if hc (x, y) + hc (y, x) = 0, then y is also a point of minimum of u \u2212 \u016d, which is\nthe desired result.\niii \u21d2 ii. The point x is a point of minimum of the function hc (x, .)+hc (., x). As a consequence,\nthe point y is also a point of minimum for this function, so that hc (x, y) + hc (y, x) = hc (x, x) +\nhc (x, x) = 0.\nii \u21d2 i. We have the inequalities\nhc (x, z) 6 hc (x, y) + hc (y, z) and hc (y, z) 6 hc (y, x) + hc (x, z).\nIf hc (x, y)+ hc (y, x) = 0, then these inequalities sum to an equality, hence they are both equalities.\n\n(4.2) The equivalent properties of the Lemma define an equivalence relation on A(c). We call\nstatic classes the classes of equivalence for this relation. In other words, we say that the points\nx and y of A(c) belong to the same static class if they satisfy (i), (ii) or (iii) of the lemma. We\nusually denote by S a static class, and by S(x) the static class containing x. If S is a static class,\nwe denote by S\u0303 the set of points of \u00c3(c) whose projection on M belong to S. We will also call\nstatic classes the sets of the form S\u0303. The static classes S are compact and partition A(c), the static\nclasses S\u0303 are compact, invariant, and they partition \u00c3(c). The invariance is a direct consequence\nof the caracterisation (iii) of the equivalence relation. To each point x of the Aubry set A(c), we\nassociate the weak KAM solution hc (x, .), and we denote by Ec,x the associated element of Vc .\nThe pseudographs of this form are called elementary solutions of Vc . Two points of a same static\nclass give rise to the same elementary solution, we will denote by Ec,S the elementary solution\ninduced by points of S. There is a one to one correspondence between the set of static classes\nand the set of elementary solutions. We will denote by Ec \u2282 Vc this set. We endow it with the\ninduced metric, it is clearly a compact set for this metric. We also denote by \u0114c,S the fixed point\nof \u03a6\u0306 associated to the dual weak KAM solution \u2212h(., x) for x \u2208 S.\n(4.3) Proposition.\nLet G \u2208 Vc be a fixed point, and let P be a point of \u1e20. The \u03b1-limit of\nthe orbit \u03c6n (P ) is contained in one static class S\u0303 \u2282 \u00c3(c). We also have P \u2208 \u0112c,S . In a similar\nway, if P \u2208 \u011e \u2208 V\u0306c , then the \u03c9-limit of the orbit of P is contained in one static class of \u00c3(c).\nProof. Let \u03b1 \u2282 M be the projection of the \u03b1-limit of the orbit of P \u2208 Gc,u . Note that this\n\u03b1-limit is contained in \u0128(G), so that it is a Lipschitz graph above \u03b1. We claim that, for each weak\nKAM solution or backward weak KAM solution v, the function u \u2212 v is constant on \u03b1. Clearly,\n22\n\n\fthis implies that \u03b1 is contained in a static class. In order to prove the claim, we consider the\nprojection x(t) on M of the orbit of P . The curve x(t) is calibrated by u on (\u2212\u221e, 0], hence the\nequality\nu(x(\u2212m)) \u2212 u(x(\u2212n)) = Ac (\u2212n, x(\u2212n), \u2212m, x(\u2212m))\nholds for all n, m \u2208 N such that m 6 n. On the other hand, if v is a weak KAM solution or a\nbackward weak KAM solution, we have the inequality\nv(x(\u2212m)) \u2212 v(x(\u2212n)) 6 Ac (\u2212n, x(\u2212n), \u2212m, x(\u2212m))\nfor all n, m \u2208 N such that m 6 n. We deduce that the sequence (u \u2212 v)(x(\u2212n)) : N \u2212\u2192 R is\nnon-increasing. Now let y = limk\u2192\u221e x(\u2212nk ) and z = limk\u2192\u221e x(\u2212mk ) be two points of \u03b1. We\ncan suppose that nk 6 mk 6 nk+1 by extracting subsequences. We obtain (u \u2212 v)(x(\u2212nk )) >\n(u \u2212 v)(x(\u2212mk )) > (u \u2212 v)(x(\u2212nk+1 )), and at the limit (u \u2212 v)(y) > (u \u2212 v)(z) > (u \u2212 v)(y).\nHence the function u \u2212 v is constant on \u03b1. This proves the first statement of the proposition.\nTaking v = hc (\u03b1, .), we obtain that the sequence u(x(\u2212n)) \u2212 hc (\u03b1, x(\u2212n)) : N \u2212\u2192 R is nonincreasing. On the other hand, we have u(x(0)) \u2212 hc (\u03b1, x(0)) 6 u(\u03b1). It follows that the sequence\nis in fact constant, so that the curve x(t) is calibrated by Ec,S(\u03b1) on (\u2212\u221e, 0], and, by (2.8),\n((x(0), p(0)) \u2208 \u0112c,S(\u03b1) .\nCorollary.\nLet P \u2208 \u00d1 (c) be a point whose \u03b1-limit is contained in S\u0303 and whose \u03c9-limit is\ncontained in S\u0303 \u2032 . We have\n \u0303 \u0114c,S \u2032 .\nP \u2208 Ec,S \u2227\nProof. Let (x(t), p(t)) be the orbit of P . Let \u03b1 be an \u03b1-limit point of the curve x(t), and let\n\u03c9 be an \u03c9-limit point. It follows from the proposition that (x(m), p(m)) \u2208 \u0112c,S for each m \u2208 Z.\nApplying the discussions in the proof of the proposition with the point P = (x(m), p(m)) and the\nfunctions u = hc (\u03b1, .) and v = \u2212hc (., \u03c9), we get that the sequence hc (\u03b1, x(n)) + hc (x(n), \u03c9) is\nnon-decreasing on n 6 m. Since we can take any m \u2208 Z, this sequence is non-decreasing on Z.\nTaking a sequence mk \u2212\u2192 \u221e such that x(mk ) \u2212\u2192 \u03c9 we obtain the inequality\nhc (\u03b1, \u03c9) 6 hc (\u03b1, x(n)) + hc (x(n), \u03c9) 6 lim(hc (\u03b1, x(mk )) + hc (x(mk ), \u03c9)) = hc (\u03b1, \u03c9).\nk\n\nIt follows that, for each n,\nhc (\u03b1, x(n)) + hc (x(n), \u03c9) = hc (\u03b1, \u03c9) = min hc (\u03b1, .) + hc (., \u03c9).\nM\n\nThis is precisely saying that\nx(n) \u2208 Ec,S(\u03b1) \u2227 \u0114c,S(\u03c9) .\n \u0303 \u0114c,S(\u03c9) .\nRecalling that (x(n), p(n)) \u2208 \u0112c,S , we obtain (x(n), p(n)) \u2208 Ec,S(\u03b1) \u2227\n(4.4) Lemma. If the static class S is isolated in A(c), then there exists a neighborhood V of\nS in M such that the \u03b1-limit of every point P \u2208 Ec,S satisfying \u03c0(P ) \u2208 V is contained in S.\nProof. If the result did not hold true, we could find a sequence (xn , pn ) \u2208 Ec,S that has a limit\n(x, p) \u2208 S\u0303 and a sequence \u03b1n of \u03b1-limit points of (xn , pn ) that has a limit \u03b1 in \u00c3(c) \u2212 S\u0303. Note that\nthe orbit (xn (t), pn (t)) : (\u2212\u221e, 0] \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M of (xn , pn ) is contained in Ec,S . Hence it is calibrated\nby the function hc (x, .), that is\nhc (x, xn (0)) = hc (x, xn (\u2212k)) + Ac (\u2212k, xn (\u2212k); 0, xn (0)) + k\u03b1(c)\nfor all k \u2208 N. At the liminf k \u2212\u2192 \u221e, for fixed n, we obtain the inequality hc (x, xn ) >\nhc (x, \u03b1n ) + hc (\u03b1n , xn ) hence the equality hc (x, xn ) = hc (x, \u03b1n ) + hc (\u03b1n , xn ). At the limit n \u2212\u2192 \u221e\nwe get 0 = hc (x, x) = hc (x, \u03b1) + hc (\u03b1, x). This is in contradiction with the fact that \u03b1 and x do\nnot belong to the same static class.\n\n23\n\n\f \u0303 \u0114c,S \u2032 contains S\u0303 and\n(4.5) Let S\u0303 and S\u0303 \u2032 be two different static classes in \u00c3(c). The set Ec,S \u2227\nS\u0303 \u2032 as well as other orbits of \u00d1 (c). The following result is similar to Theorem A of [11].\nProposition.\nThe set Ec,S \u2227 \u0114c,S \u2032 \u2212 (S \u222a S \u2032 ) is not empty and contains points in every\nneighborhood of S, as well as in every neighborhood of S \u2032 . More precisely, if S and S \u2032 are two,\npossibly equal, static classes, and if K\u0303 \u2282 S\u0303 and K\u0303\u2032 \u2282 S\u0303 \u2032 are two disjoint compact invariant sets,\nthen the set Ec,S \u2227 \u0114c,S \u2032 \u2212 (K \u222a K\u2032 ) contains points in every neighborhood of K, as well as in every\nneighborhood of K\u2032 .\nProof. Let V be an open neighborhood of K in M which does not intersect S \u2032 . Let us fix a\nrecurrent orbit (y(t), z(t)) : R \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M such that (y(0), z(0)) = (y, z) \u2208 K\u0303 and a recurrent orbit\n(y \u2032 (t), z \u2032 (t)) : R \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M such that (y \u2032 (0), z \u2032 (0)) = (y \u2032 , z \u2032 ) \u2208 K\u0303\u2032 . Consider a sequence nk \u2208 N\nof integers and a sequence (xk (t), pk (t)) : [0, nk ] \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M of Hamiltonian trajectories such that\nxk (0) = y and xk (nk ) = y \u2032 and\nZ nk\nL(t, xk (t), \u1e8bk (t)) \u2212 cxk (t) (\u1e8bk (t)) + \u03b1(c) dt = Ac (0, y; nk , y \u2032 ) + nk \u03b1(c) \u2212\u2192 hc (y, y \u2032 ).\n0\n\nWe extend the curve xk : [0, nk ] \u2212\u2192 M to a curve xk : R \u2212\u2192 R by setting xk (t) = y(t) for t 6 0\nand xk (t) = y \u2032 (t \u2212 nk ) for t > nk . Let ak and bk be two increasing sequences of integers such\nthat y(\u2212ak ) \u2212\u2192 y and y \u2032 (bk ) \u2212\u2192 y \u2032 . The existence of such sequences follows from the fact that\nthe curves y(t) and y \u2032 (t) are recurrent. Since the curve y(t) is calibrated by hc (y, .), we have, as\nk \u2212\u2192 \u221e,\nAc (\u2212ak , y(\u2212ak ); 0, y) + ak \u03b1(c) = \u2212hc (y, y(\u2212ak )) \u2212\u2192 0\nand similarly\n\nAc (0, y \u2032 ; bk , yk (bk )) + bk \u03b1(c) = hc (y \u2032 , y(bk )) \u2212\u2192 0.\n\nAs a consequence, we have, as k \u2212\u2192 \u221e,\nAc (\u2212ak , xk (\u2212ak ); bk + nk , xk (bk + nk )) + (bk + ak + nk )\u03b1(c) \u2212\u2192 hc (y, y \u2032 ).\nFor each k, let Tk be the maximum of all times i \u2208 N such that xk (i) \u2208 V . Note that xk (Tk +1) does\nnot belong to V . We can assume, taking a subsequence, that the curve xk (t + Tk ) is converging,\nuniformly on compact sets to a limit x(t) : R \u2212\u2192 M . Let us now fix m 6 n in Z. Summing the\ninequalities\n\u0010\n\u0011\nlim inf Ac (\u2212ak , xk (\u2212ak ); Tk + m, xk (Tk + m)) + (Tk + m + ak )\u03b1(c) > hc (y, x(m)),\nk\u2212\u2192\u221e\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nlim inf Ac (Tk + m, xk (Tk + m); Tk + n, xk (Tk + n)) = Ac (m, x(m); n, x(n))\nk\u2212\u2192\u221e\n\nand\n\u0010\n\u0011\nlim inf Ac (Tk + n, xk (Tk + n); bk + nk , xk (bk + nk ))) + (bk + nk \u2212 Tk \u2212 n)\u03b1(c) > hc (x(n), y \u2032 ),\nk\u2212\u2192\u221e\n\nwe get\nh(y, y \u2032 ) = lim inf Ac (\u2212ak , xk (\u2212ak ); bk + nk , xk (bk + nk )) + (bk + ak + nk )\u03b1(c)\nk\u2212\u2192\u221e\n\n> hc (y, x(m)) + Ac (m, x(m); n, x(n)) + (n \u2212 m)\u03b1(c) + hc (x(n), y \u2032 ).\nSince the converse inequality obviously holds, we obtain the equality\nhc (y, y \u2032 ) = hc (y, x(m)) + Ac (m, x(m); n, x(n)) + (m \u2212 n)\u03b1(c) + hc (x(n), y \u2032 ),\nfor all m 6 n. It follows that all the inequalities above are in fact equalities, so that we also have\nhc (y, x(m)) + Ac (m, x(m); n, x(n)) + (m \u2212 n)\u03b1(c) = hc (y, x(n))\n24\n\n\fso that the orbit x(t) is calibrated by the weak KAM solution hc (y, .) on R. Hence it is the\nprojection of a Hamiltonian trajectory (x(t), p(t)). Moreover, we have the equality\nhc (y, y \u2032 ) = hc (y, x(n)) + hc (x(n), y \u2032 ),\nso that the point x(n) is a point of minimum of the function hc (y, .) + hc (., y \u2032 ). Hence it belongs\nto Ec,S \u2227 \u0114c,S \u2032 . We have proved that the sequence (x(n), p(n)), n \u2208 Z is an orbit of \u03c6 which is\n \u0303 \u0114c,S \u2032 . Since the point x(1) is not a point of K, this orbit\ncontained in the invariant graph Ec,S \u2227\ndoes not intersect the invariant set K\u0303. As a consequence, the point x(0) belongs to V\u0304 \u2212 K. We\nhave proved that the set Ec,S \u2227 \u0114c,S \u2032 \u2212 (K \u222a K\u2032 ) contains points in each neighborhood of K. One\ncan prove in a similar way that this set contains points in every neighborhood of K\u2032 .\n\n(4.6) Corollary.\nA static class S\u0303 cannot be decomposed as the union of two disjoint\ninvariant compact subsets.\nProof. Assume, by contradiction, that there exists a static class S\u0303 = K\u03031 \u222a K\u03032 , with K\u0303i invariant,\ncompact and disjoint. In view of (4.5), the set\nEc,S \u2227 \u0114c,S \u2212 (K1 \u222a K2 )\nis not empty. This is a contradiction since Ec,S \u2227 \u0114c,S = S and K1 \u222a K2 = S.\n(4.7) Let (x(t), p(t)) : R \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M be an orbit of the Ma\u00f1\u00e9 set, that is an orbit satisfying\n(x(0), p(0)) \u2208 \u00d1 (c). This orbit is \u03b1-asymptotic to a static class S\u0303, and \u03c9-asymptotic to a static\nclass S\u0303 \u2032 .\nLemma.\nThe inclusion (x(0), p(0)) \u2208 \u00c3(c) holds if and only if S = S \u2032 . In this case, we have\n(x(0), p(0)) \u2208 S\u0303\nProof. Let us first assume that S = S \u2032 . In this case, we see from Corollary (4.3) that\n \u0303 \u0114c,S . But is is clear from the definition of static classes that Ec,S \u2227\n \u0303 \u0114c,S = S\u0303.\n(x(0), p(0)) \u2208 Ec,S \u2227\nConsequently, we have (x(0), p(0)) \u2208 S\u0303 \u2282 \u00c3(c). Conversely, assume that (x(0), p(0)) \u2208 \u00c3(c).\nThen this point is contained in one static class S \u03030 . Since this static class is compact and invariant,\nit contains the \u03b1 and the \u03c9-limits of the orbit (x(t), p(t)), so that we have S\u0303 = S\u03030 = S\u0303 \u2032 .\nCorollary\n\u00c3(c).\n\nWe have the equality \u00c3(c) = \u00d1 (c) if and only if there is exactly one static class in\n\n(4.8) Let H\u0303c (S\u0303, S\u0303 \u2032 ) be the set of orbits of \u00d1 (c) which are heteroclinic orbits between the static\nclasses S\u0303 and S\u0303 \u2032 , we denote by Hc (S, S \u2032 ) its projection on M . We have\n[\n\u00d1 (c) = \u00c3(c) \u222a\nH\u0303c (S, S \u2032 ),\nS,S \u2032\n\nwhere the union is taken on all pairs (S, S \u2032 ) of different static classes. Recall, from Corollary (4.3),\nthat\n \u0303 \u0114c,S \u2032 .\nH\u0303c (S\u0303, S\u0303 \u2032 ) \u2282 Ec,S \u2227\nThe following result is from [18] and [11].\n(4.9) proposition. If the static class S\u0303 is properly contained and isolated in \u00c3(c), then there\nexists an orbit of \u03c6 in \u00d1 (c) \u2212 \u00c3(c) which is \u03b1-asymptotic to S\u0303. This orbit is then \u03c9-asymptotic\nto another static class S\u0303 \u2032 .\nProof. Let us chose, according to (4.4), a neighborhood V of S such that every orbit of Ec,S\n25\n\n\fstarting above V has its \u03b1-limit contained in S. Now let us choose any static class S \u2032\u2032 different\nfrom S. In view of (4.5), the set Ec,S \u2227 \u0114c,S \u2032\u2032 intersects V \u2212 S. Let P (t) = (x(t), p(t)) : R \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M\n \u0303 \u0114c,S \u2032\u2032 and x(0) \u2208 V \u2212 S. The \u03b1-limit of the orbit P (t) is conbe an orbit such that P (0) \u2208 Ec,S \u2227\ntained in S\u0303. On the other hand, this orbits belongs to \u00d1 (c), hence its \u03c9-limit is contained in some\nstatic class S\u0303 \u2032 .\n\n(4.10) We have treated so far the case where there exist several static classes. We recall,\nhowever that the existence of a single static class in A(c), is, for c fixed, a generic property of the\nLagrangian, see [11]. We will explain in section 7 a device due to Fathi, as well as Contreras and\nPaternain, see [18] and [11], which allows to treat this case.\nAbstract mechanisms\n5\n\nThe relation and its dynamical consequences\n\nWe define the forcing relation \u22a3\u22a2, and describe its dynamical consequences. We prove Proposition (0.10).\n(5.1) Let us introduce some useful notations. Given two subsets G and G \u2032 of T \u2217 M , we define\nthe relation G \u22a2N G \u2032 as follows:\nG \u22a2N G \u2032 \u21d0\u21d2 \u1e20 \u2032 \u2282\n\nN\n[\n\n\u03c6n (G),\n\nn=1\n\nwhere as usual \u1e20 is the closure of G. We say that G forces G \u2032 , and write G \u22a2 G \u2032 if there exists an\ninteger N such that G \u22a2N G \u2032 . If G is a subset of T \u2217 M and if c \u2208 H 1 (M, R), the relations\nG \u22a2 c and G \u22a2N c\nmean that there exists an overlapping pseudograph G \u2032 of cohomology c and such that G \u22a2 G \u2032 (resp.\nG \u22a2N G \u2032 ). To finish, for c and c\u2032 two cohomology classes, the relation\nc \u22a2 N c\u2032\nmeans that, for each pseudograph G \u2208 Pc , we have G \u22a2N c\u2032 . As the reader may have guessed, we\nwill then say that c forces c\u2032 (c \u22a2 c\u2032 ) if there exists an integer N such that c \u22a2N c\u2032 . The relation\n\u22a2 (between subsets as well as between cohomology classes) is obviously transitive. We will be\nconcerned in this paper with understanding the relation \u22a2 between cohomology classes. For this\npurpose, it is useful to introduce the symmetric relation\nc\u22a3\u22a2c\u2032 \u21d0\u21d2 c \u22a2 c\u2032 and c\u2032 \u22a2 c.\nWe say that c and c\u2032 force each other if c\u22a3\u22a2c\u2032 .\nProposition The forcing relation \u22a3\u22a2 is an equivalence relation on H 1 (M, R).\nNote that we have c \u22a21 c for each c since \u03a6(G) \u2282 \u03c6(G) for each G \u2208 Pc , which can be written\nG \u22a21 \u03a6(G).\n(5.2) Let us present a simple (negative) result about this relation. If G is a the graph of a\ncontinuous section of T \u2217 M , and is invariant under \u03c6, then G \u2208 V \u2229 V\u0306 is in fact a Lipschitz graph,\nand the relation c(G) \u22a2 c holds if and only if c = c(G). Note that, if C \u2282 H 1 (M, R) is bounded,\nit is possible to chose a uniform constant K such that all the invariant Lipschitz Graphs G whose\ncohomology satisfies c \u2208 C are K-Lipschitz. In other words, the elements of VC \u2229 V\u0306 are equiLipschitz graphs. Of course, we would like to be able to prove that the forcing relation \u22a3\u22a2 has\nnon-trivial classes. We first restate and prove Proposition (0.10).\n26\n\n\f(5.3)\n\nProposition\n\n(i) If the cohomology class c forces the cohomology class c\u2032 , there exists a heteroclinic trajectory\nof the Hamiltonian flow between \u00c3(c) and \u00c3(c\u2032 ). For any closed forms \u03b7 of cohomology c and\n\u03b7 \u2032 of cohomology c\u2032 , there exists a positive integer N and a trajectory (q(t), p(t)) : [0, N ] \u2212\u2192\n\u2032\nT \u2217 M of the Hamiltonian flow such that p(0) = \u03b7q(0) and p(N ) = \u03b7q(N\n) . There exists a\ntrajectory (q(t), p(t)) : [0, \u221e) \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M which satisfies p(0) = \u03b7q(0) and is \u03c9-asymptotic to\n\u2032\n\u00c3(c\u2032 ). There exists a trajectory (q(t), p(t)) : (\u2212\u221e, 0] \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M which satisfies p(0) = \u03b7q(0)\nand is \u03b1-asymptotic to \u00c3(c).\n(ii) Let ci , i \u2208 Z, be a sequence of cohomology classes such that ci forces ci+1 for each i \u2208 Z. Fix\nfor each i a neighborhood Ui of M\u0303(ci ) in T \u2217 M . There exists a trajectory of the Hamiltonian\nflow which visits in turn all the sets Ui . In addition, if the sequence stabilizes to c\u2212 on the\nleft, or to c+ on the right, the trajectory can be assumed negatively asymptotic to A(c\u2212) or\npositively asymptotic to A(c+).\nProof. Let us first assume that c \u22a2 c\u2032 . Take a fixed point Gc \u2208 Vc . There exists a graph\nG \u2208 Pc\u2032 such that Gc \u22a2 G. Now, consider a pseudograph \u011ec\u2032 \u2208 V\u0306c\u2032 . It follows from Lemma (2.3)\nthat G intersects \u011ec\u2032 . In view of (4.3), the points of intersection are \u03b1-asymptotic to \u00c3(c) and\n\u03c9-asymptotic to \u00c3(c\u2032 ). In the same way, we can take for Gc the graph of the closed form \u03b7, choose\nG \u2208 Pc\u2032 such that Gc \u22a2 G, and take for \u011ec\u2032 the graph of \u03b7 \u2032 . The points of the intersection G \u2229 \u011ec\u2032\nhave trajectories from Gc to \u011ec\u2032 . The other statements of (i) are proved similarly.\n(5.4)\n\nLemma\n\nLet us fix a cohomology c.\n\n(i) For each neighborhood U of \u1ebc(c), there exists N \u2208 N such that, for all l > N and all G \u2208 Pc ,\nwe have\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c6\u2212l \u03a62l (G) \u2282 U.\n(ii) If V is an open neighborhood of M\u0303(c) in T \u2217 M , there exists N \u2208 N such that, for each G \u2208 Pc\nand each P \u2208 \u03a6N (G), one of the points \u03c6\u2212i (P ), 1 6 i 6 N \u2212 1 belongs to V .\nProof. In order to prove (i), it is sufficient to prove that, if Gn \u2208 Pc is a sequence of pseudographs,\nif mn is an increasing sequence of integers, and if (xn (t), pn (t)) : [0, mn ] \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M is a Hamiltonian\ntrajectory which satisfies\n(xn (mn ), pn (mn )) \u2208 \u03a62mn (Gn )\nand which converges uniformly on compact sets to a limit (x(t), p(t)) : R+ \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M , then\n(x(0), p(0)) \u2208 \u1ebc(c).\nLet us write the pseudographs \u03a6mn (Gn ) on the form Gc,un . For each k, n \u2208 N, we have\nTck un (xn (k))\n\n= un (xn (0)) +\n\nZ\n\nk\n\nL(t, xn (t), \u1e8bn (t)) + cxn (t) (\u1e8bn (t))dt.\n\n0\n\nSince the functions un lie in the image of the operator Tcmn , they are equi-Lipschitz, and there\nexists a real sequence \u03bbn such that the sequence of functions \u03bbn +un has an accumulation points in\nC(M, R). As a consequence, we can assume, taking a subsequence if necessary, that the functions\n\u03bbn + un converge uniformly to a limit u. We have Gc,u = lim \u03a6mn (Gn ) \u2208 Oc . For each fixed k \u2208 Z,\ntaking the limit as n \u2212\u2192 \u221e, we get\nTck u(x(k))\n\n= u(x(0)) +\n\nZ\n\nk\n\nL(t, x(t), \u1e8b(t)) + cx(t) (\u1e8b(t))dt.\n\n0\n\nHence we have P (k \u2212 1) \u2208 \u03a6k\u22121 (Gc,u ), and therefore P (0) \u2208 \u03c61\u2212k (\u03a6k\u22121 (Gc,u )). Since this holds\nfor all k \u2208 N, we conclude that\nP (0) \u2208 \u0128(Gc,u ) \u2282 \u1ebc(c).\n27\n\n\fIn order to prove (ii), it is useful to recall that \u1ebc(c) is a compact set, invariant under the timeone flow \u03c6, and that the Mather set M\u0303(c) is the union of the supports of the invariant measures\nof the action of \u03c6 on \u1ebc(c). The claim below follows from general facts about topological dynamics\non compact spaces: For each neighborhood W of M\u0303(c) in \u1ebc(c), there exists an integer k such that,\nfor each point P of \u1ebc(c), one of the points \u03c6i (P ), 1 6 i 6 k, belongs to W . As a consequence, if V\nis a neighborhood of M\u0303(c) in T \u2217 M , there exists a neighborhood U of \u1ebc(c) in T \u2217 M such that, for\neach P \u2208 U , one of the points \u03c6i (P ), 1 6 i 6 k, belongs to V . Now let us take l > k such that (i)\nholds for this neighborhood U , and set N = 2l. For each G \u2208 Pc and each P \u2208 \u03a6N (G), we have\n\u03c6\u2212l (P ) \u2208 U . Hence one of the points \u03c6i\u2212l (P ), 1 6 i 6 k is in V , which proves (ii).\n\n(5.5) Let us now prove (ii) of the proposition. Let Mi \u2208 N, i \u2208 Z be a sequence of integers such\nthat ci \u22a2Mi ci+1 , and let Wi \u2282 Vi be compact neighborhoods of M\u0303(ci ). In view of lemma (5.4),\nthere exists a sequence Ni of integers such that, for each G \u2208 Pci and each\nP \u2208 \u03c6\u2212Ni (\u03a6Ni (G)),\none of the points \u03c6l (P ), 0 6 l 6 Ni belongs to Wi .\nk\nLet us first fix an integer k \u2208 N, and choose a pseudograph G\u2212k\n\u2208 Pc\u2212k . Since c\u2212k \u22a2M\u2212k c1\u2212k ,\nk\nN\u2212k\nk\nk\nthere exists a pseudograph G1\u2212k \u2208 Pc1\u2212k such that \u03a6\n(G\u2212k ) \u22a2M\u2212k G1\u2212k\n. We build, by induction,\nk\na sequence Gi \u2208 Pci , i > \u2212k, of pseudographs such that\nk\n\u03a6Ni (Gik ) \u22a2Mi Gi+1\n\nfor each i > \u2212k.\nk\nLet us now take a point Pkk \u2208 Gkk . There exists a positive integer lk\u22121\n6 Mk\u22121 such that\nk\n\nk\n\nk\nk\nk\n). We then set Pk\u22121\n= \u03c6\u2212(lk\u22121 +Nk\u22121 ) (Pkk ), this point belongs to Gk\u22121\n.\n\u03c6\u2212lk\u22121 (Pkk ) \u2208 \u03a6Nk\u22121 (Gk\u22121\nk\nk\nk\nWe can build a sequence Pi , \u2212k 6 i 6 k of points of Gi and a sequence li , \u2212k 6 i 6 k \u2212 1 of\nintegers satisfying 0 6 lik 6 Mi such that\nk\n\nk\n\u03c6Ni +li (Pik ) = Pi+1\n\nfor each i. In addition, one of the points \u03c6j (Pik ), 0 6 j 6 Ni belongs to Wi .\nThere exists an increasing sequence kn of integers such that each of the sequences n 7\u2212\u2192 likn ,\nfor fixed i, is the constant li after a certain rank, and each of the sequences n 7\u2212\u2192 Pikn , for fixed\ni, is converging to Pi . Clearly, we have \u03c6li +Ni (Pi ) = Pi+1 for each i \u2208 Z, and one of the points\n\u03c6j (Pi ), 0 6 j 6 Ni belongs to Wi . This proves the main part of the statement.\nIf the sequence ci stabilizes to c\u2212 on the right, then it is possible to build a sequence Gi \u2208 Pci\nas above which stabilizes to G\u2212 \u2208 Vc\u2212 on the right, and we obtain by the above method an\norbit which is \u03b1-asymptotic to \u00c3(c\u2212) and then visits in turn all the sets Wi . If the sequence ci\nstabilizes to c+ on the right, say for i > I, then it is possible to impose that PI \u2208 \u011e+ \u2208 V\u0306c+ in\nthe construction above, and we then obtain an orbit which is \u03c9-asymptotic to \u00c3(c+).\n\n6\n\nEvolution operators\n\nWe define operators on P that generalize the Lax-Oleinik operator \u03a6. These operators will\nplay a central role in the proof of our main results.\n\u2032\n\n(6.1) Given two integers N \u2032 > N > 1, and a cohomology c, we define the function AN,N\n:\nc\nM \u00d7 M \u2212\u2192 R by the expression\n\u2032\n\nAcN,N (x, y) =\n\nmin\n\nk\u2208N,N 6k6N \u2032\n\nAc (0, x; k, y) + k\u03b1(c).\n\nSince each of the mappings\nH 1 (M, R) \u2212\u2192 C(M \u00d7 M, R)\n28\n\n\fc 7\u2212\u2192 Ac (0, .; k, .)\nis continuous (see appendix B), it is easy to see that, for fixed N \u2032 > N , the mapping\nH 1 (M, R) \u2212\u2192 C(M \u00d7 M, R)\nc 7\u2212\u2192 AN,N\nc\n\n\u2032\n\nis continuous.\nProposition Let c be a fixed cohomology class.

By arguments\nsimilar to those of (2.7), recalling that the function u is semi-concave, we conclude that the function\nu is differentiable at yn , and, setting zn = cyn + duyn , that \u03c6k (yn , zn ) = (xn , pn ). By extracting\nanother subsequence, we can suppose that the sequence yn has a limit y \u2208 K\u2032 . We then have\nv(x) = u(y) + Ac (0, y; k, x) + k\u03b1(c),\nso that the function u is differentiable at y. Since the function u is semi-concave, we then have\nduy = lim duyn , see Appendix (A.9).

Let us also denote by L \u25e6 T P : R \u00d7 T M0 \u2212\u2192 R the lifted Lagrangian\nL \u25e6 T P (t, x, v) = L(t, P (x), dPx (v)),\nand by T \u2217 P : T \u2217 M0 \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M the covering\n(x, p) 7\u2212\u2192 (P (x), p \u25e6 dPx\u22121 ).\n31\n\n\fThe lifted Hamiltonian H \u25e6T \u2217P is in natural duality with the Lagrangian L\u25e6T P . As a consequence,\nthe Hamiltonian flow associated to the Lagrangian L \u25e6 T P is the Hamiltonian flow of H \u25e6 T \u2217 P ,\nwhich is the lifting of the Hamiltonian flow of H. Each overlapping pseudograph G = Gc,u on M\nlifts to a pseudograph\nP \u2217 G := T \u2217 P \u22121 (G) = GP \u2217 c,u\u25e6P\non M0 . Note that c(P \u2217 G) = P \u2217 (c(G)). It is not hard to see that the Aubry set \u00c3L\u25e6T P (P \u2217 (c))\nassociated to L \u25e6 T P on M0 is precisely\n\u00c3L\u25e6T P (P \u2217 (c)) = T \u2217 P \u22121 (\u00c3L (c)),\nwhile we only have the inclusion\n\u00d1L\u25e6T P (P \u2217 (c)) \u2283 T \u2217 P \u22121 (\u00d1L (c)).\nFinally, if SL\u25e6T P is a static class of AL\u25e6T P (P \u2217 (c)) , then P (SL\u25e6T P ) is a static class of AL (c). Note\nhowever that the lifting P \u22121 (SL ) of a static class of AL (c) can contain several static classes of\nAL\u25e6T P (P \u2217 (c)). This is illustrated by the following result which, in conjunction with (4.9), allows\nto prove the existence of heteroclinic orbits in the case where there is only one static class, see [18]\nand [11]. We need first another definition. If X \u0303 \u2282 T \u2217 M is an invariant set of the time-one flow \u03c6,\nthen we denote by sX \u0303 \u2282 T \u2217 M \u00d7 T the set \u222at\u2208R,x\u2208X\u0303 (\u03c6t0 (x), t) and by sX its projection on M \u00d7 T.\n(7.2) Proposition. Assume that the set A(c) contains finitely many static classes, and that\nthere exists an open neighborhood U \u2282 M \u00d7 T of the compact set sA(c) such that the mapping\nh : H1 (U, Z) \u2212\u2192 H1 (M, Z) is not surjective, where h is the composition of the mappings\np\u2217\n\ni\n\n\u2217\nH1 (M \u00d7 T, Z) \u2212\u2192 H1 (M, Z)\nH1 (U, Z) \u2212\u2192\n\ninduced from the inclusion and the projection. Then there exists a finite connected Galois covering\nP : M0 \u2212\u2192 M with k sheets, k > 2, such that, for each static class S\u0303 of \u00c3(c), the lifting T \u2217 P \u22121 (S\u0303)\nis the union of exactly k different static classes of \u00c3L\u25e6T P (P \u2217 (c)).\nProof. Let N be the number of static classes in A(c). First, we claim that for each static class\nS, the set sS is connected. This follows easily from (4.6). As a consequence, we can suppose that\nthe neighborhood U is a union of finitely many connected open sets Ui , 1 6 i 6 N , each of which\ncontains exactly one of the sets sS. Since the group H 1 (M, Z) is Abelian and of finite type, and\nsince the mapping h : H1 (U, Z) \u2212\u2192 H1 (M, Z) is not surjective, there exists an integer k > 2 and\na surjective morphism g : H 1 (M, Z) \u2212\u2192 Z/kZ whose kernel contains the subgroup h(H1 (U, Z)).\nThere is a connected Galois covering P : M0 \u2212\u2192 M with k sheets associated to this morphism.\nThis means that, if \u03c7 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2212\u2192 H1 (M, Z) is the Hurewitz map, then the image P\u2217 (\u03c01 (M0 )) in\n\u03c01 (M ) is precisely the kernel of g \u25e6 \u03c7.

In order to prove the claim, let us first\nnotice that g \u25e6 \u03c7 \u25e6 p\u2217 \u25e6 i\u2217 = g \u25e6 p\u2217 \u25e6 i\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c7 : \u03c01 (U ) \u2212\u2192 Z/kZ is the zero map. This implies that\nthe image of the map i\u2217 : \u03c01 (U ) \u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (M \u00d7 T) is contained in the kernel of g \u25e6 \u03c7 \u25e6 p\u2217 . In order\n32\n\n\fto finish the proof of the claim, we check that the image of (P \u00d7 Id)\u2217 is precisely the kernel of\ng \u25e6 \u03c7 \u25e6 p\u2217 . This follows from the fact ker(g \u25e6 \u03c7) = im(P\u2217 ), and from the fact that the upper square\nof the diagram can be identified with\n\u03c01 (M0 ) \u00d7 Z \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (M0 )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nP\u2217 \u00d7Idy\nP\u2217 y\n\u03c01 (M ) \u00d7 Z \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03c01 (M )\n\nwhere the horizontal arrows are projections on the first factor. The claim is proved, so that the\ncovering P \u00d7 Id is trivial above U . It follows that each connected component Ui of U has k\ndisjoint connected preimages Vij \u2282 M0 \u00d7 T. Now it is not hard to see that the static classes of\nAL\u25e6T P (P \u2217 (c)) are precisely the intersections\nT P \u22121 (A(c)) \u2229 Vij = AL\u25e6T P (P \u2217 (c)) \u2229 Vij , 1 6 i 6 N, 1 6 j 6 k.\n\n(7.3) Proposition.\nLet P : M0 \u2212\u2192 M be a finite Galois covering. Let c and c\u2032 be two\n1\ncohomology classes in H (M, R). If P \u2217 (c) \u22a2N P \u2217 (c\u2032 ) for the forcing relation associated to the\nLagrangian L \u25e6 T P on M0 , then c \u22a2N c\u2032 .\nProof. Let us consider a pseudograph G \u2282 Pc . If P \u2217 (c) \u22a2N P \u2217 (c\u2032 ) then there exists a pseudograph G \u2032 on M0 of cohomology P \u2217 (c\u2032 ) and such that P \u2217 G \u22a2N G \u2032 . Let D be the group of deck\ntransformations of the covering P . The elements of D are the diffeomorphisms D of M0 such that\nP \u25e6 D = P . To each element D of D we associate the fibered diffeomorphism T \u2217 D of T \u2217 M defined\nby\nT \u2217 D(x, p) = (D(x), p \u25e6 dDx\u22121 ).\nThis diffeomorphism is a Deck transformation of the covering T \u2217 P . Let us prove that there\nexists a pseudograph G \u2032\u2032 on M0 which is invariant by deck transformations, which has cohomology\nP \u2217 (c\u2032 ), and such that P \u2217 G \u22a2N G \u2032\u2032 . Let \u03b7 be a form on M with cohomology c\u2032 , and let P \u2217 \u03b7 be its\nlifting to M0 . We write G \u2032 on the form GP \u2217 \u03b7,u . Since the flow of H \u25e6 T \u2217 P commutes with Deck\ntransformations, and since the pseudograph P \u2217 G is invariant by deck transformations, we have\nP \u2217 G = T \u2217 D(P \u2217 G) \u22a2N T \u2217 D(G \u2032 )\nfor each deck transformation D. It is easy to check that T \u2217 D(G \u2032 ) = GP \u2217 \u03b7,u\u25e6D\u22121 . Setting\nv := min u \u25e6 D\u22121 ,\nD\u2208D\n\nand G \u2032\u2032 = G\u03b7,v , we have G \u2032\u2032 \u2282 \u222aD\u2208D T \u2217 D(G \u2032 ) hence P \u2217 G \u22a2N G \u2032\u2032 , and we have the desired properties\nfor G \u2032\u2032 . Since P is a Galois covering, functions on M0 which are invariant by deck transformations\nare liftings of functions on M . As a consequence, there exists a continuous function w : M \u2212\u2192 R\nsuch that v = w \u25e6 P . Hence the pseudograph G \u2032\u2032 is the lifting of the pseudograph G\u03b7,w on M . Since\nP \u2217 G \u22a2N G \u2032\u2032 = P \u2217 G\u03b7,w , we have G \u22a2N G\u03b7,w . We have asssociated, to each pseudograph G \u2208 Pc , a\npseudograph G\u03b7,w \u2208 Pc\u2032 such that G \u22a2N G\u03b7,w . This proves that c \u22a2N c\u2032\n\n8\n\nMather's mechanism\n\nWe comment and prove Theorem (0.11). Let us first discuss some properties of the subspace\nR(c) as defined in (0.11).\n\n33\n\n\f(8.1) It is useful to consider the \u010cech cohomology \u021e(., R) with real coefficients. Recall that\nH(., R) is the De Rham cohomology. We identify the De Rham cohomology H 1 (M, R) with the\n\u010cech cohomology \u021e 1 (M, R). If K is any subset of M , we denote by \u0131\u030c\u2217K the mapping \u021e 1 (M, R) \u2212\u2192\n\u021e 1 (K, R) induced from the inclusion iK : K \u2212\u2192 M . Recalling that the subspace R(G) was defined\nin (0.11), we have:\nLemma.\n\nFor each G \u2208 Vc , we have R(G) = ker(\u0131\u030c\u2217I(G) ).\n\nProof. Consider an open neighborhood V0 of I(G) which is such that, for each open neighborhood\nV \u2282 V0 of I(G) in M , R(G) is the set of cohomology classes of smooth closed one-forms which\nvanish on V . Let us fix an open neighborhood V \u2282 V0 of I(G) in M . Clearly, the cohomology\nclasses of smooth closed one-forms which vanish on V0 belong to ker(i\u2217V ) (where i\u2217V is the mapping\nassociated to the inclusion in De Rham cohomology). We have proved the inclusion R(G) \u2282\nker(i\u2217V ). Conversely, let \u03c9 be a smooth closed one-form on M whose De Rham cohomology belongs\nto ker(i\u2217V ). This means that the restricted form \u03c9|V is exact. Hence there exists a smooth function\nf on V such that \u03c9|V = df . There exists a smooth function f \u0303 : M \u2212\u2192 R which is equal to f in a\nneighborhood \u1e7c \u2282 V of I(G). The form \u03c9 \u2212 df \u0303 is a smooth closed form on M , cohomologous to\n\u03c9, and vanishing on \u1e7c . As a consequence, we have [\u03c9] = [\u03c9 \u2212 df \u0303] \u2208 R(G). We have proved that\nker(i\u2217V ) = R(G)\nfor all open neighborhood V \u2282 V0 of I(G) in M . The Lemma follows because ker(\u0131\u030c\u2217I(G) ) is equal\nto ker(i\u2217V ) when V is a sufficiently small open neighborhood of I(G) in M .\n(8.2) In order to avoid confusion, we shall denote by jK\u0303 : K\u0303 \u2212\u2192 T \u2217 M the inclusion of a subset K\u0303 of T \u2217 M into T \u2217 M , and by \uf6be\u030c\u2217K\u0303 : \u021e 1 (T \u2217 M, R) \u2212\u2192 \u021e 1 (K\u0303, R) the associated mapping in\n\u010cech cohomology.

We have (\u03c0 \u2217 )\u22121 ker(\uf6be\u030c\u2217\u00d1 (c) ) \u2282 R(c).\n\nProof. It is enough to prove that, for each G \u2208 Vc , we have ker(\uf6be\u030c\u2217\u00d1 (c) ) \u2282 \u03c0 \u2217 (R(G)). For each\nG \u2208 Vc , we have \u0128(G) \u2282 \u00d1 (c), hence ker(\uf6be\u030c\u2217\u00d1 (c) ) \u2282 ker(\uf6be\u030c\u2217\u0128(G) ). So it is enough to prove that the inclusion ker(\uf6be\u030c\u2217\u0128(G) ) \u2282 \u03c0 \u2217 (R(G)) holds for each G \u2208 Vc . Let us consider such a pseudograph G.

Let us fix a cohomology class c0 . We claim that, for each G0 \u2208 Vc0 , there exists \u01eb0 > 0\nsuch that each fixed pseudograph G of V which satisfies kG \u2212 G0 k 6 \u01eb0 has to satisfy\nR(G0 ) \u2282 R(G).\nThis claim follows from the existence of a neighborhood U of I(G0 ) such that R(G0 ) is the set\nof cohomology classes of smooth closed one-forms which vanish on U , and from the fact that the\ninclusion I(G) \u2282 U holds when G is sufficiently close to G0 . Let BP (G, \u01eb) denote the open ball of\ncenter G and radius \u01eb in P. The compact set Vc0 is covered by a finite family of balls BP (Gi , \u01ebi )\nsuch that Gi \u2208 Vc0 and such that R(Gi ) \u2282 R(G) for each G \u2208 BP (Gi , \u01ebi ). Since the map c is\ncontinuous and proper on V, see (3.7), there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that, for |c \u2212 c0 | 6 \u03b4, we have\nVc \u2282 \u222ai BP (Gi , \u01ebi ). As a consequence, if G belongs to some Vc with |c \u2212 c0 | 6 \u03b4, then there exists\ni such that R(c0 ) \u2282 R(Gi ) \u2282 R(G). We conclude that R(c0 ) \u2282 R(c) for |c \u2212 c0 | 6 \u03b4.\nThe following proposition is the main step in the proof of Theorem (0.11). We denote by BE (r)\nthe open ball of radius r centered at the origin in the normed vector space E.\n(8.4) Proposition.\nFor each G0 \u2208 Vc0 , there exists a positive number \u01eb0 , and an integer\nN such that the following holds: For each pseudograph G \u2208 P satisfying kG \u2212 G0 k < \u01eb0 and\nc(G) \u2212 c0 \u2208 R(c0 ), for each cohomology class c satisfying c \u2212 c0 \u2208 BR(c0 ) (\u01eb0 ) \u2282 R(c0 ), we have\nG \u22a2N c.\nNote in this statement that the cohomology class of the pseudograph G is denoted by c(G), and\nthat the symbol c alone denotes another cohomology class.\n(8.5) Proof of Theorem (0.11).\nWe assume the proposition. For Each G0 \u2208 Vc0 , we\nconsider the number \u01eb0 given by the proposition, and the open ball BP (G0 , \u01eb0 ) of center G0 and\nradius \u01eb0 in P. Since Vc0 is compact, it can be covered by a finite number of these balls, we denote\nGi and \u01ebi the associated centers and radii. Since the function c restricted to V is proper, (3.7),\nthere exists a positive number \u03b4 such that Vc \u2282 \u222ai BP (Gi , \u01ebi ) when |c \u2212 c0 | 6 \u03b4. Consider two\ncohomology classes c and c\u2032 in c0 + BR(c0 ) (\u01eb), with \u01eb = min{\u03b4, \u01ebi }. It follows from (6.5) that c\nforces c\u2032 . The theorem clearly follows.\ntheorem\n\n(8.6) Proof of the Proposition. Let us fix a G0 \u2208 Vc0 and choose a neighborhood U\nof I(G0 ) in such a way that R(G0 ) is the set of cohomology classes of smooth closed one-forms\nvanishing on U .\nLemma There exist \u03b4 > 0 and N \u2032 6 N in N such that, for all overlapping pseudographs G\nsatisfying kG \u2212 G0 k 6 \u03b4, we have\n\u2032\n,N\nG|U \u22a2N \u03a6N\n(G)\nU\nProof. Let us write the pseudograph G0 on the form Gc0 ,u0 . We have seen in (3.9) that\nu0 (x) = min u0 (y) + hc0 (y, x) = min u0 (y) + hc0 (y, x).\ny\u2208M\n\ny\u2208A(c0 )\n\n\u221e\nAs a consequence, we have TU\u221e u0 = TM\nu0 = u0 , and the minimum in the definition of TU\u221e u0 (x)\nis not reached outside of I(G), which is a compact set contained in U . The lemma now follows\nfrom proposition (6.4).\n\n35\n\n\f(8.7) Lemma. Let us fix a \u03b4 > 0. There exists \u01eb0 > 0 such that, if we take :\nOne one hand a cohomology class c satisfying c \u2212 c0 \u2208 R(G0 ) and kc \u2212 c0 k 6 \u01eb0 ;\nOn the other hand a pseudograph G \u2208 P satisfying kG \u2212 G0 k 6 \u01eb0 and c(G) \u2208 c0 + R(G0 );\n\u2032\nThen there exists a pseudograph G \u2032 \u2208 Pc with the following properties: kG \u2032 \u2212G0 k 6 \u03b4 and G|U = G|U\n.\nProof. Let us write G0 = G\u03b70 ,u0 . In view of the definition of R(G0 ), it is possible to associate to\neach cohomology class d \u2208 R(G0 ) a closed one-form \u03bcd which is null on U . In addition, we can\nimpose that the correspondence d 7\u2212\u2192 \u03bcd is linear. Given a pseudograph G \u2208 P and a cohomology\nc satisfying the hypotheses of the Lemma, we consider the pseudograph\nG \u2032 = G + G\u03bc(c\u2212c(G)) ,0 \u2208 Pc .\n\u2032\nIt is clear that G|U\n= G|U , that c(G \u2032 ) = c, and that kG \u2032 \u2212 G0 k 6 \u03b4 if \u01eb0 is small enough.\n\n(8.8) We are now in a position to end the proof of the proposition. Let us consider \u03b4 given by\nLemma (8.6), and the associated \u01eb0 as given by Lemma (8.7). If G and c satisfy the hypotheses of the Proposition with this value of \u01eb0 , then, by Lemma (8.7), there exists a pseudograph\n\u2032\nG \u2032 such that c(G \u2032 ) = c and G|U\n= G|U and kG \u2032 \u2212 G0 k 6 \u03b4. In view of Lemma (8.6), we have\nG|U \u22a2N \u03a6N\nU\n9\n\n\u2032\n\n,N\n\n(G \u2032 ), so that G \u22a2N \u03a6N\nU\n\n\u2032\n\n,N\n\n(G \u2032 ).\n\nproposition\n\nArnold's mechanism for systems with finitely many static classes\nWe prove and generalize Theorem (0.12).\n\n \u0303 S\u0303 \u2032 ) be the set of orbits of the Ma\u00f1\u00e9 set \u00d1 (c) which are heteroclinic orbits\n(9.1) Let H\u0303c (S,\nbetween the static classes S\u0303 and S\u0303 \u2032 , we denote by Hc (S, S \u2032 ) its projection on M . We have, from\nsection 4,\n[\nH\u0303c (S, S \u2032 ),\n\u00d1 (c) = \u00c3(c) \u222a\nS,S \u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere the union is taken on all pairs (S, S ) of different static classes. In addition, it is useful to\nrecall that\n \u0303 \u0114c,S \u2032 .\nH\u0303c (S\u0303, S\u0303 \u2032 ) \u2282 Ec,S \u2227\nWe say that the set H\u0303c (S, S \u2032 ) is neat if it admits a compact subset K\u0303 which contains one and only\none point in each orbit of \u03c6|H\u0303c (S,S \u2032 ) and whose projection K on M is acyclic. This means that K\nhas a neighborhood U whose inclusion i into M induces the null map i\u2217 : H1 (U, R) \u2212\u2192 H1 (M, R).\n(9.2) Theorem Let c0 be a cohomology class such that the number of static classes in A(c0 )\nis finite and greater than one. Assume in addition that all the sets H\u0303c0 (S, S \u2032 ) are neat. Then the\nclass c0 is in the interior of its class of \u22a3\u22a2-equivalence.\nLet us gather some preliminary consequences of the hypotheses.\n(9.3) Lemma We assume the hypotheses of the theorem. Let S0 be a static class and V0 be a\nneighborhood of S0 .\n(i) There exists an open neighborhood V of S0 , contained in V0 , such that the boundary of V\ndoes not intersect I(Ec0 ,S0 ).\n(ii) There exists an acyclic open set U \u2282 V0 \u2212 S0 and a static class S1 such that the intersection\nU \u2229 I(Ec0 ,S0 ) is not empty, compact, and contained in H(S0 , S1 ).\nProof. Let V0 be a neighborhood of S0 , sufficiently small for lemma (4.4) to apply, so that we\nhave\n[\n\u0001\nH(S0 , S) \u2229 V0 ,\nV0 \u2229 I(Ec0 ,S0 ) = S0 \u222a\nS\u2208E(c0 )\u2212S0\n\n36\n\n\fwhere the union is taken on all static classes S 6= S0 . We shall also assume that V\u03040 \u2229 A(c0 ) = S0 .\nFor each static class S, let us consider an acyclic compact set K\u0303(S0 , S) which contains one\nand only one point in every orbit of H\u0303(S0 , S), and denote by K(S0 , S) its projection on the base.\nClearly, the sets K\u0303(S0 , S), S \u2208 E(c0 ) \u2212 S0 , are pairwise disjoint and they all belong to the Lipschitz\ngraph \u0128(Ec0 ,S0 ), so that their projections K(S0 , S) on the base are also pairwise disjoint. Let us\nconsider a static class S 6= S0 . For n large enough, we have \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6\u2212n (K\u0303(S0 , S)) \u2282 V0 . In addition,\nsince K(S0 , S) is acyclic in M , the compact K\u0303(S0 , S) is acyclic in T \u2217 M . As a consequence, the\ncompact set \u03c6\u2212n (K\u0303(S0 , S)) is acyclic in T \u2217 M and contained in the Lipschitz graph \u0128(Ec0 ,S0 ), so\nthat \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6\u2212n (K\u0303(S0 , S)) is acyclic in M . Consequently, recalling that the number of static classes\nis finite, there is no loss of generality in supposing that the sets K(S0 , S), S \u2208 E(c0 ) \u2212 S0 , are all\ncontained in V0 .\nLet us prove that each of the sets K\u0303(S0 , S) is isolated in \u0128(Ec0 ,S0 ). Let F be a compact\nneighborhood of S0 which does not intersect any of the finitely many compact sets K(S0 , S), S \u2208\nE(c0 ) \u2212 S0 . Since the points of K\u0303(S0 , S) are \u03b1-asymptotic to S\u03030 and \u03c9-asymptotic to S\u0303, and\nsince there are finitely many static classes, there exists an integer N such that all the sets \u03c0 \u25e6\n\u03c6n (K\u0303(S0 , S)), n \u2208 N, S \u2208 E(c0 ) \u2212 S0 , are contained in F for n 6 \u2212N , and do not intersect V\u03040 for\nn > N . The set (V0 \u2212F )\u2229I(Ec0 ,S0 ) is thus covered by finitely many pairwise disjoint compact sets\nof the form \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6n (K\u0303(S0 , S)), n \u2208 Z, S \u2208 E(c0 ) \u2212 S0 . As a consequence, each of the sets K(S0 , S)\nis isolated in (V0 \u2212 F ) \u2229 I(Ec0 ,S0 ), and then also in I(Ec0 ,S0 ). Let us fix a static class S1 6= S0\nsuch that K(S0 , S1 ) is not empty. Such a static class exists by (4.9). Then, we can find an open\nneighborhood U \u2282 V0 of K(S0 , S1 ) such that U is acyclic and such that U \u2229 I(Ec0 ,S0 ) = K(S0 , S1 )\nis a non-empty compact set contained in H(S0 , S1 ). We have proved (ii).\nLet us consider again the finite family of pairwise disjoint compact sets \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6n (K\u0303(S0 , S)), n \u2208\nZ, |n| 6 N, S \u2208 E(c0 ) \u2212 S0 . There exists a finite family of pairwise disjoint compact sets\nKn\u2032 (S0 , S), n \u2208 N, |n| 6 N, S \u2208 E(c0 )\u2212S0 such that Kn\u2032 (S0 , S) is a neighborhood of \u03c0\u25e6\u03c6n (K\u0303(S0 , S)).\nWe can clearly assume in addition that the sets Kn\u2032 (S0 , S) do not intersect S0 . The set\n[\nKn\u2032 (S0 , S)\nV = V0 \u2212\nn\u2208N,|n|6N,S\u2208E(c0)\u2212S0\n\nis an open neighborhood of S0 which is contained in V0 , and its boundary does not intersect\nI(Ec0 ,S0 ). We have proved (i).\nThe following proposition is the main step in the proof of the theorem.\n(9.4) Proposition Let c0 satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem (9.2). For each weak KAM solution G0 \u2208 Vc0 , there exists a number \u01eb > 0 and an integer N such that, if G \u2208 P and c \u2208 H 1 (M, R)\nsatisfy\nkG \u2212 G0 k 6 \u01eb and |c \u2212 c0 | 6 \u01eb\nthen G \u22a2N c.\n(9.5) Proof of the Theorem. We assume the Proposition. Let us cover the compact set\nVc0 by a finite number of balls B(Gi , \u01ebi ), where \u01ebi is given by the Proposition applied to Gi . Since\nthe function c restricted to V is proper, the union of these finite balls covers the sets Vc for c\nsufficiently close to c0 . The Theorem holds by Proposition (6.5).\ntheorem\nWe now prove the Proposition in three steps.\n(9.6) Step 1.\nLet G \u2208 Vc0 be a fixed point. If there exist only finitely many static classes\nin A(c0 ), then there exists an elementary solution E0 and a neighborhood U0 of the corresponding\nstatic class S0 such that G|U0 = E0|U0 .\n\n37\n\n\fProof. Let us fix the solution G = Gc0 ,u . We define a partial order on the set of static classes by\nsaying that S 6 S \u2032 if, for each x \u2208 S and x\u2032 \u2208 S \u2032 , we have hc0 (x, x\u2032 ) = u(x\u2032 ) \u2212 u(x). It is easy to\ncheck that this relation satisfies the following three axioms of order relations:\n\u2022 S 6 S,\n\u2022 S 6 S \u2032 and S \u2032 6 S \u2032\u2032 =\u21d2 S 6 S \u2032\u2032 ,\n\u2022 S 6 S \u2032 and S \u2032 6 S =\u21d2 S = S \u2032 .\nSince the number of static classes is finite, there exists an initial element S0 , that is an element\nwhich is not greater than any other element. Let us write\nu(x) = min u(a) + hc0 (a, x),\na\u2208A\n\nand consider, for each point x, the set A(c0 ) \u2229 (G \u2227 \u0114c0 ,x ) of points a where the minimum is\nreached. Let us first assume that x \u2208 S0 . In this case, a is a point of minimum if and only if the\nstatic class Sa of a satisfies Sa 6 S0 . Since the class S0 is initial, this implies that Sa = S0 , or\nequivalently, that a \u2208 S0 . In other words, for x \u2208 S0 , the compact set A(c0 ) \u2229 (G \u2227 \u0114c0 ,x ) does\nnot intersect other static classes than S0 . This implies that, for x sufficiently close to S0 , the\nset A(c0 ) \u2229 (G \u2227 \u0114c0 ,x ) does not intersect other static classes than S0 . Since, for each x, the set\nA(c0 ) \u2229 (G \u2227 \u0114c0 ,x ) contains a static class, we conclude that, for x sufficiently close to S0 , we have\nS0 = A(c0 ) \u2229 (G \u2227 \u0114c0 ,x ).\nAs a consequence, we have, if x is sufficiently close to S0 ,\nu(x) = u(a) + hc0 (a, x),\nfor each a \u2208 S0 . In other words, the difference x 7\u2212\u2192 hc0 (a, x) \u2212 u(x) is the constant u(a) in a\nneighborhood of S0 .\nstep 1\n\n(9.7) step 2. Let S0 be a static class of A(c0 ) and let U0 be a neighborhood of S0 satisfying\n(ii) of (9.3). There exists a static class S1 , an open neighborhood U1 of S1 and, for each \u03b4 > 0, a\nnumber \u01eb > 0 and an integer N with the following property : If G \u2208 P satisfies kG \u2212 Ec0 ,S0 kU0 6 \u01eb\nand c \u2208 H 1 (M, R) satisfies |c \u2212 c0 | 6 \u01eb, then there exists a pseudograph G \u2032 \u2208 Pc such that\nkG \u2032 \u2212 Ec0 ,S1 kU1 6 \u03b4 and\n\u2032\nG|U0 \u22a2N G|U\n1\nProof.

Indeed, if (x, a) \u2208 K \u00d7 S1 ,\nthen x \u2208 Ec0 ,x0 \u2227 \u0114c0 ,a , so that hc0 (x0 , x) + hc0 (x, a) = hc0 (x0 , a), and\nhc0 (x0 , x) + hc0 (x, a) + hc0 (a, y) = hc0 (x0 , y) =\n\nmin\n\n(z,z \u2032 )\u2208M\u00d7M\n\nhc0 (x0 , z) + hc0 (z, z \u2032 ) + hc0 (z \u2032 , y).\n\nHence we have\nhc0 (x0 , x) + hc0 (x, a) + hc0 (a, y) =\n\nmin\n\n(z,z \u2032 )\u2208\u016a\u00d7A(c)\n\nhc0 (x0 , z) + hc0 (z, z \u2032 ) + hc0 (z \u2032 , y).\n\nWe have proved that the pairs of K \u00d7 S1 are minimizing in the equation (\u22c4) for y \u2208 S1 .\nLet us now prove that they are the only minimizing pairs. A pair (x, a) is minimizing if and\nonly if hc0 (x0 , a)+hc0 (a, y) = hc0 (x0 , y) and hc0 (x0 , x)+hc0 (x, a) = hc0 (x0 , a). The second equality\nimplies\nx \u2208 Ec0 ,S0 \u2227 \u0114c0 ,S(a) \u2282 I(Ec0 ,S0 ).\nSince I(Ec0 ,S0 ) \u2229 \u016a = K, this implies x \u2208 K. If x \u2208 K and a \u2208 A(c0 ), then the equality\nhc0 (x, a) = hc0 (x, y) + hc0 (y, a) holds for all y \u2208 S1 . Indeed, let x(n) = \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6n (x, \u2212\u22021 h(x, a)) be\nthe projection of the orbit of the only point of \u0114c0 ,S(a) above x. We have, for each n \u2208 N, the\nequality of calibration by \u2212hc0 (., a):\nAc0 (0, x, n, x(n)) + n\u03b1(c0 ) = hc0 (x, a) \u2212 hc0 (x(n), a).\nLet nk be an increasing sequence of integers such that the subsequence x(nk ) has a limit \u03c9 \u2208 S1 .\nTaking the liminf as k \u2212\u2192 \u221e, we get hc0 (x, \u03c9) 6 hc0 (x, a) \u2212 hc0 (\u03c9, a), which implies the desired\nequality for \u03c9, and then for all points of S1 .\nSince (x, a) is a minimizing pair for v(y), we get, by decomposing hc0 (x, a) in the expression\nof v,\nv(y) = hc0 (x0 , x) + hc0 (x, y) + hc0 (y, a) + hc0 (a, y)\nand, since v(y) 6 hc0 (x0 , x) + hc0 (x, y), we finally obtain that hc0 (y, a) + hc0 (a, y) 6 0 so that\na \u2208 S1 . We have proved the claim. In addition, we have proved, for x1 \u2208 S1 and x \u2208 K, the\nequality\nv(x1 ) = hc0 (x0 , x) + hc0 (x, x1 ) = hc0 (x0 , x1 ).\nAs a consequence, for y \u2208 S1 , each point a \u2208 A(c) which is minimizing in the equation\nv(y) = min v(a) + hc0 (a, y)\na\u2208A(c0 )\n\nbelongs to S1 . Since S1 is isolated in A(c), the conclusion holds also for y sufficiently close to S1 .\nWe then have the equality\nv(y) = v(x1 ) + hc0 (x1 , y) = hc0 (x0 , x) + hc0 (x, x1 ) + hc0 (x1 , y)\nfor all x1 \u2208 S1 and x \u2208 K (and no other x in \u016a ).\n(9.9) Applying (6.4), we get the existence of a positive \u01eb\u2032 and of integers N 6 N \u2032 such that each\nG \u2208 P which satisfies kG \u2212 Ec0 ,S0 kU 6 \u01eb\u2032 also satisfies\n\u2032\n\n(G)|U1 .\nG|U \u22a2N \u2032 \u03a6N,N\nU\n39\n\n\f\u0001\n\u2032\nSince \u03a6\u221e\nU Ec0 ,S0 |U1 = Ec0 ,S1 |U1 in view of the lemma, and by (6.3), the integers N and N can\nbe chosen such that, in addition, we have\n\u2032\n\nk\u03a6N,N\n(Ec0 ,S0 ) \u2212 Ec0 ,S1 kU1 6 \u03b4/2.\nU\n\u2032\n\nReducing \u01eb\u2032 if necessary, we can furthermore assume, by continuity of \u03a6N,N\n, that\nU\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nk\u03a6N,N\n(G) \u2212 \u03a6N,N\n(Ec0 ,S0 )kU1 6 \u03b4/2\nU\nU\nwhen kG \u2212 Ec0 ,S0 kU 6 \u01eb\u2032 , so that\n\u2032\n\nk\u03a6N,N\n(G) \u2212 Ec0 ,S1 kU1 6 \u03b4.\nU\nSince U is acyclic, for each cohomology c and each pseudograph G, there exists a pseudograph\nG(c) which has cohomology c and such that G|U = G(c)|U . There exists a positive \u01eb such that, if\n|c \u2212 c0 | 6 \u01eb and if kG \u2212 Ec0 ,S0 kU 6 \u01eb, then we have\nkG(c) \u2212 Ec0 ,S0 kU 6 \u01eb\u2032 .\nNote that this norm does not depend on the choice of G(c). As a consequence, setting G \u2032 =\n\u2032\n\u03a6N,N\n(G(c)), we have c(G \u2032 ) = c,\nU\n\u2032\nG|U = G(c)|U \u22a2N \u2032 G|U\n1\nand\n\nkG \u2032 \u2212 Ec0 ,S1 kU1 6 \u03b4.\nstep 2\n\n(9.10) Step 3. Let S1 be a static class in A(c0 ) satisfying (i) of (9.3), and let U1 be a fixed\nneighborhood of S1 . There exists a number \u03b4 > 0 and an integer N such that, if G \u2032 \u2208 P satisfies\n\u2032\n\u22a2N c(G \u2032 )\nkG \u2032 \u2212 Ec0 ,S1 kU1 6 \u03b4, then G|U\n1\nProof. There exists an open neighborhood V1 \u2282 U1 of S1 such that I(Ec0 ,S1 )\u2229V1 = I(Ec0 ,S1 )\u2229V\u03041 .\n(this is (i) of (9.3)). Let x1 be a point of S1 and set u1 = hc0 (x1 , .). Recall that (by definition)\nu (x) = min hc0 (x1 , y) + hc0 (y, x).\nTc\u221e\n0 ,V1 1\ny\u2208V\u03041\n\nTaking y = x1 in this expression, we obtain the inequality Tc\u221e\nu (x) 6 u1 (x). On the other hand,\n0 ,V1 1\nu (x) = u1 (x),\nwe have the triangle inequality u1 (x) 6 hc0 (x1 , y)+hc0 (y, x) for each y, so that Tc\u221e\n0 ,V1 1\nand\nmin hc0 (x1 , y) + hc0 (y, x) = hc0 (x1 , x) = min hc0 (x1 , y) + hc0 (y, x).\ny\u2208M\n\ny\u2208V\u03041\n\nBy (3.6) the points y where this last minimum is reached belong to I(Ec0 ,S1 ). As a consequence,\nfor each x \u2208 M , the points where the minimum is reached in the definition of Tc\u221e\nu (x) belong\n0 ,V1 1\nto I(Ec0 ,S1 ) \u2229 V1 , which is a compact set contained in V1 . In view of (6.4), there exist integers N\nand N \u2032 and a positive real number \u03b4 such that, if G \u2032 \u2208 P satisfies kG \u2032 \u2212 Ec0 ,S1 kV1 6 \u03b4, then\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n(G \u2032 ).\n\u22a2N \u03a6N,N\nG|V\nV1\n1\nstep 3\n\nThe proposition obviously follows from the three steps above.\n\n40\n\nProposition\n\n\fApplications\n10\n\nTwist Maps\n\nThe case where M = T is well known and have been studied many times. The resulting timeone flow is then a finite composition of right twist maps of the biinfinite annulus T \u2217 T. In view of\n(0.10), much of what is known on the existence of orbits with prescribed behavior is summed up\nin the following discussion.\n(10.1) Let G \u2208 H 1 (T, R) be the set of cohomology classes of invariant curves which are Lipschitz\ngraphs. The set G is closed, and every point c \u2208 G is alone in its class of \u22a3\u22a2-equivalence, as follows\nfrom (5.2). Conversely, if c does not belong to G, then all the sets I(G), G \u2208 Vc are properly\ncontained in T. It follows that R(G) = R for each G \u2208 Vc , so that R(c) = R and, in view of (0.11),\nc is in the interior of its class of equivalence. The classes of \u22a3\u22a2-equivalence are the points of G\nand the connected components of the complement of G.\n(10.2) For completeness, we recall without proof some of the special properties of Aubry sets\nin dimension one, see [14] for example. The function \u03b1 is differentiable, and its differential \u03b1\u2032 (c)\nis the rotation number of every orbit of \u00d1 (c). If \u03b1\u2032 (c) is irrational, then there is only one element\nin Vc . If \u03b1\u2032 (c) is rational, then the Mather set M\u0303(c) is made of periodic orbits.\n11\n\nGeneralized Arnold Example\n\n(11.1)\n\nIn this application, we take\nM = T \u00d7 N,\n\nwhere N is a compact manifold of dimension d \u2212 1, and denote by q = (q1 , q2 ) the points of M .\nWe assume that the homology group H1 (N, Z) is not trivial. We denote the points of T M by\n(q, v) = (q1 , q2 , v1 , v2 ), where (q1 , v1 ) \u2208 T T and (q2 , v2 ) \u2208 T N . In the same way, we denote by\n(q, p) = (q1 , q2 , p1 , p2 ) the points of T \u2217 M . We will consider the projection \u03c01 : T \u00d7 N \u2212\u2192 T and\nthe induced mapping\n\u03c01\u2217 : H 1 (T, R) \u2212\u2192 H 1 (T \u00d7 N, R).\n(11.2)\n\nLet us fix a point 0 in N . We will consider Lagrangian systems which satisfy\nL(t, q1 , q2 , v1 , v2 ) > L(t, q1 , 0, v1 , 0)\n\nfor all (q2 , v2 ) 6= (0, 0), all t \u2208 R and all (q1 , v1 ) \u2208 T T. Let \u2202v L : T M \u2212\u2192 T\u2217 M be the Legendre transform associated to L. We denote by T1 the submanifold T \u00d7 {0} of M , by T \u2217 T1 the\nsubmanifold {q2 = 0, p2 = 0} of T \u2217 M , and T T1 the submanifold {q2 = 0, v2 = 0} of T M . We\nhave\n\u2202v L(T T1 ) = T \u2217 T1 ,\nand this manifold is invariant under the Hamiltonian flow. Moreover, the restriction of the flow\nto T \u2217 T1 is the Hamiltonian flow of the restriction H1 (t, q1 , p1 ) := H(t, q1 , p1 , 0, 0) of H. Setting\nL1 (t, q1 , v1 ) = L(t, q1 , 0, v1 , 0), we see that L1 is the Lagrangian associated to H1 . We denote by\n\u03c61 the restriction of \u03c6 to T \u2217 T.\n(11.3) Theorem Under the non-degeneracy conditions (11.4) and (11.5) to be specified below,\nthe image of \u03c01\u2217 is contained in one class of \u22a3\u22a2-equivalence.\n(11.4) Genericity property for \u03c61 . We assume that every rotational invariant circle of\n\u03c61 which contains a periodic orbit is completely periodic (every orbit of this circle is periodic).\nWe could, more simply, require that the map \u03c61 does not have any invariant circle containing\na periodic orbit. This property is known to be generic in any reasonable sense of the term.\nHowever, allowing periodic circles includes the important case where \u03c61 is integrable, as in the\noriginal Arnold's example.\n41\n\n\f(11.5) nondegeneracy of external homoclinics. We assume that, for each c \u2208 \u03c01\u2217 (H 1 (T, R)),\nthere exists a finite Galois covering P : M0 \u2212\u2192 M such that the set\n\u00d1L\u25e6T P (P \u2217 (c)) \u2212 T \u2217 P \u22121 (T \u2217 T1 )\nis not empty and contains finitely many orbits. Note that, since H 1 (N, Z) is not zero, it follows\nfrom (7.2), (4.5), and (11.6) below that there exists a finite Galois covering P : M0 \u2212\u2192 M\nsuch that the set under consideration is not empty. So the important point of our assumption is\nfiniteness. As the reader will see it in the proof, this assumption could be somewhat weakened.\n(11.6) Lemma For each cohomology c = \u03c01\u2217 (c1 ), with c1 \u2208 H 1 (T, R), we have N (c) \u2282 T1 . As\na consequence, the restriction to T1 gives a bijection between the set Vc and the set Vc1 associated\nto the Lagrangian L1 on T T1 .\nProof. Let us fix a cohomology c1 \u2208 H 1 (T, R) and its image c := \u03c01\u2217 (c1 ). Let \u03bc be a form on T\nwhich represents c1 , and \u03b7 be its pull back on M = T \u00d7 N . Consider a pseudograph G \u2208 Vc , and\nwrite it G = G\u03b7,u . We want to prove that \u0128(G) \u2282 T \u2217 T1 . Let (q(t), p(t)) be the trajectory of the\nHamiltonian flow starting in \u0128(G). We have, for k < l in Z,\nZ l\nu(q(l)) \u2212 u(q(k)) =\nL(\u03c3, q(\u03c3), q\u0307(\u03c3)) \u2212 \u03bcq1 (\u03c3) (q\u03071 (\u03c3)) + \u03b1(c) d\u03c3\nk\n\nand\nu(q1 (t), 0) \u2212 u(q1 (s), 0) 6\n\nZ\n\nl\n\nk\n\nIt follows that\nZ\n\nL(\u03c3, (q1 (\u03c3), 0, q\u03071 (\u03c3), 0) \u2212 \u03bcq1 (\u03c3) (q\u03071 (\u03c3)) + \u03b1(c) d\u03c3.\n\nl\n\nL(\u03c3, q(\u03c3), q\u0307(\u03c3)) \u2212 L(\u03c3, (q1 (\u03c3), 0), (q\u03071 (\u03c3), 0)) d\u03c3 6 2(max u \u2212 min u)\n\nk\n\nLet us denote by L\u0303 the function\nL\u0303(t, q, v) = L(t, q, v) \u2212 L(t, (q1 , 0), (v1 , 0))\nR\nwhich is positive except on T T1 . Since the integral R L\u0303(\u03c3, q(\u03c3), q\u0307(\u03c3))d\u03c3 is finite, we have\nlim inf L\u0303(\u03c3, q(\u03c3), q\u0307(\u03c3)) = 0,\n\n|\u03c3|\u2212\u2192\u221e\n\nand consequently lim inf |\u03c3|\u2212\u2192\u221e (q2 (t), v2 (t)) = 0. We now return to the inequality\nZ l\nL\u0303(\u03c3, q(\u03c3), q\u0307(\u03c3))d\u03c3 6 u(q(t)) \u2212 u(q1 (t), 0) \u2212 u(q(s)) + u(q1 (s), 0),\nk\n\nfrom which we get\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nL\u0303(\u03c3, q(\u03c3), q\u0307(\u03c3))d\u03c3 = 0,\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhich implies that (q2 , v2 ) \u2261 0. We have proved that \u0128(G) \u2282 T \u2217 T1 .\n(11.7) Let us fix cohomologies c = \u03c01\u2217 (c1 ), c1 \u2208 H 1 (T, R), such that there exists an invariant\nLipschitz Graph G in Vc1 . If the rotation number of \u03c61|G is irrational, then Vc1 contains only one\nelement. As a consequence, Vc also contains only one element, so that \u00d1 (c) = \u00c3(c) = G, and\nthere is only one static class in \u00c3(c). If the rotation number is rational, then in view of (11.4) the\ngraph G is a union of periodic orbits, so that G = M\u0303(c). As a consequence, we have A(c) = T1 ,\nand there is only one static class.\nIn view of (11.5), there exists a finite Galois covering P : M0 \u2212\u2192 M such that the Lagrangian\nL \u25e6 T P satisfies the hypotheses of (9.2). As a consequence, the cohomology P \u2217 (c) is in the interior\nof its forcing class for L \u25e6 T P . It follows from (7.3) that the cohomology c is in the interior of its\nforcing class for L.\n42\n\n\f(11.8) Let c = \u03c01\u2217 (c1 ) be such that each set I(G), G \u2208 Vc is properly contained in T1 . Applying\n(0.11), we observe that R(c) = H 1 (M, R), and c is in the interior of its forcing class.\n(11.9) We have proved that each c \u2208 \u03c01\u2217 (T, R) is in the interior of its forcing class. Since the\nsubspace \u03c01\u2217 (H 1 (T, R)) is obviously connected, it is contained in one forcing class.\n\nAppendix\nA\n\nSemi-concave functions\n\nWe recall some useful facts on semi-concave functions. In all this section, M is a compact\nmanifold of dimension d. It is useful for the sequel to fix once and for all a finite atlas \u03a6 of M\ncomposed of charts \u03c6 : B3 \u2212\u2192 M , where Br is the open ball of radius r centered at zero in Rd .\nWe assume that the sets \u03c6(B1 ), \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 cover M . A family F of C 2 functions is said bounded if\nthere exists a constant C > 0 such that\nkd2 (u \u25e6 \u03c6)x k 6 C\nfor all x \u2208 B1 , \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, u \u2208 F . Note that a bounded family is not required to be bounded in C 0\nnorm, but will automatically be bounded in C 1 norm and thus equi-Lipschitz. The notion of\nbounded family of functions does not depend on the atlas \u03a6.\n(A.1) A function u : M \u2212\u2192 R is called semi-concave if there exists a bounded subset Fu of the\nset C 2 (M, R) such that\nu = inf f.\nf \u2208Fu\n\nA family U of functions is called equi-semi-concave if there exists a bounded set F of functions in\nC 2 (M, R), and, for each function u \u2208 U, a subset Fu of F such that\nu = inf f.\nf \u2208Fu\n\nLet us first collect some easy consequences of this definition. We shall prove later that the infima\ncould be replaced by minima in these definitions.\n(A.2)\n\nAn equi-semi-concave set of functions is equi-Lipschitz.\n\n(A.3) If U is an equi-semi-concave set of functions on M , and if the infimum inf u\u2208U u(x0 ) is\nfinite for some x0 \u2208 M , then the function v(x) = inf u\u2208U u(x) is finite and semi-concave.\n(A.4) Let U be an equi-semi-concave set of functions on N \u00d7 M , where N is another compact\nmanifold. Then the functions u(x, .) : M \u2212\u2192 R, x \u2208 N, u \u2208 U form an equi-semi-concave set.\n(A.5) We say that the linear form p \u2208 Tx M is a proximal super-differential of the function u\nat point x if there exists a C 2 function f such that f \u2212 u has a minimum at x and dfx = p. The\ndefinition would not be changed by requiring that the function f is smooth and that the minimum\nis strict. We say that a linear form p \u2208 Tx M is a K-super-differential of the function u at point x\nif for each chart \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 and each point y \u2208 B2 satisfying \u03c6(y) = x, the inequality\nu \u25e6 \u03c6(z) \u2212 u \u25e6 \u03c6(y) 6 p \u25e6 d\u03c6y (z \u2212 y) + Kkz \u2212 yk2\nholds for each z \u2208 B2 . It is plain that p is a proximal super-differential of u if and only if there\nexists a K > 0 such that p is a K-super-differential of u.\n\n43\n\n\f(A.6) A function u on M is called K-semi-concave if it has a K-super-differential at each point.\nIt is equivalent to require that, for each \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, the function\nu \u25e6 \u03c6(y) \u2212 Kkyk2\nis concave on B2 . As a consequence, if u is K-semi-concave and if p is a proximal super-differential\nof u at x, then p is a K-super-differential of u at x.\n(A.7) Let u be a continuous function on M , and let Let A be the compact subset of M formed\nby points x \u2208 M at which both the functions u and \u2212u have a K-super-differential. Then the\nfunction u is differentiable at each point of A, and the mapping x 7\u2212\u2192 du(x) is Lipschitz on A,\nwith a Lipschitz constant that depends only on K.\nThis follows from Proposition 4.5.3 in Fathi's book [15]. We have the following useful corollary.\n(A.8) Let U be an equi-semi-concave set of functions. Then there exists a constant K with the\nfollowing property: If u and v are two functions of U, and if A is the set of points minimizing\nthe sum u + v, then the functions u and v are differentiable at each point of A, and the mapping\nA \u220b x 7\u2212\u2192 dux = \u2212dvx is K-Lipschitz.\n(A.9) If un is a sequence of K-semi-concave functions converging uniformly to a function u,\nthen the function u is K-semi-concave. In addition, if xn is a sequence of points of differentiability\nof un , converging to a point of differentiability x of u, then dun (xn ) \u2212\u2192 du(x).\nProof. By the Theorem below, the functions un form an equi-semi-concave, hence equi-Lipschitz\nfamily of functions. Let xn be a sequence converging to x, and pn be a K-super-differential of un\nat xn . The sequence pn is bounded, hence we assume that pn \u2212\u2192 p. Let y \u2208 B2 and \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 be\nsuch that \u03c6(y) = x. For n large enough, the point xn can be written \u03c6(yn ) with yn \u2208 B2 . We\nhave the inequality\nun \u25e6 \u03c6(z) 6 un \u25e6 \u03c6(yn ) + pn \u25e6 d\u03c6yn (z \u2212 yn ) + Kkz \u2212 yn k2 ,\nfor each z \u2208 B2 , and at the limit, we obtain\nu \u25e6 \u03c6(z) 6 u \u25e6 \u03c6(y) + p \u25e6 d\u03c6y (z \u2212 y) + Kkz \u2212 yk2 .\nIt means that p is a K-super-differential of u at x. Under the assumptions of the statement, we\nhave pn = duxn , and p = dux is the only possible limit of this bounded sequence, which is thus\nconverging to p.\n\n(A.10) Theorem A family U of functions is equi-semi-concave if and only if there exists a\nnumber K > 0 such that all the functions of U are K-semi-concave. In this case, there exists a\nbounded subset F \u2282 C 2 (M, R) and, for each u \u2208 U, a subset Fu of F which has the following\nproperties:\nu = min f\nf \u2208Fu\n\nand, for each point x \u2208 M and each super-differential p of u at x, there exists a function f \u2208 Fu\nsuch that (f (x), df (x)) = (u(x), p).\nIn order to prove this result, we need a Lemma:\nLemma For each K > 0, there exists a bounded subset LK of T \u2217 M which contains all the proximal super-differentials of all K-semi-concave functions. As a consequence, the K-semi-concave\n44\n\n\ffunctions are equi-Lipschitz\nproof of the Lemma Let us consider a chart \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, a K-semi-concave function u, a point\ny0 \u2208 B1 , and the point x0 = \u03c6(y0 ). Let p0 be a proximal super-differential of u at x0 , and let us\nset l = p0 \u25e6 d\u03c6y0 .\nclaim If klk > 11K, then there exists a point y \u2208 B2 which is a point of differentiability of u \u25e6 \u03c6\nand satisfies\nkd(u \u25e6 \u03c6)y k > (klk \u2212 11K)/3.\nand\nu \u25e6 \u03c6(y) < inf u \u25e6 \u03c6.\nB1\n\nProof of the Claim. Let us prove first that the infimum of u \u25e6 \u03c6 in B2 is not reached in\nB\u03041 . Assume, by contradiction, that there exists a point m \u2208 B\u03041 such that u \u25e6 \u03c6(m) = inf B2 u \u25e6 \u03c6.\nThen clearly the function u \u25e6 \u03c6 is differentiable at m, its differential is zero, and the inequality\nu \u25e6 \u03c6(y0 ) 6 u \u25e6 \u03c6(m) + Kky0 \u2212 mk2\nholds. On the other hand, we have\nu \u25e6 \u03c6(m) 6 u \u25e6 \u03c6(z) 6 u \u25e6 \u03c6(y0 ) + l(z \u2212 y0 ) + Kkz \u2212 y0 k2\nfor all z \u2208 B2 . Combining these inequalities gives\nl(y0 \u2212 z) 6 Kkz \u2212 y0 k2 + Kky0 \u2212 mk2\nfor all z \u2208 B\u03042 . Hence klk 6 5K, which is in contradiction with the hypothesis.\nLet us now consider a vector v \u2208 Rd of norm 1 and such that l(v) = \u2212klk. We get\nu \u25e6 \u03c6(y0 + v) \u2212 u \u25e6 \u03c6(y0 ) 6 l(v) + Kkvk2 = K \u2212 klk.\nHence the infimum of u \u25e6 \u03c6 on B2 is not greater than u \u25e6 \u03c6(y0 ) + K \u2212 klk. It is then possible to\nchoose a point y in B2 such that\n\u0001\nu \u25e6 \u03c6(y) < min inf u \u25e6 \u03c6, u \u25e6 \u03c6(y0 ) + 2K \u2212 klk .\nB1\n\nIn addition, since the function u \u25e6 \u03c6 is differentiable almost everywhere, we can assume that the\nfunction u \u25e6 \u03c6 is differentiable at y. We have the inequality\nu \u25e6 \u03c6(y0 ) 6 u \u25e6 \u03c6(y) + d(u \u25e6 \u03c6)y (y \u2212 y0 ) + Kky \u2212 y0 k2\nfrom which follow\nd(u \u25e6 \u03c6)y (y0 \u2212 y) 6 u \u25e6 \u03c6(y) \u2212 u \u25e6 \u03c6(y0 ) + Kky \u2212 y0 k2 6 11K \u2212 klk.\nHence kd(u \u25e6 \u03c6)y k > (klk \u2212 11K)/3. This ends the proof of the claim.\nclaim\n\nIn order to continue the proof of the Lemma, we consider the point y \u2208 B2 given by the claim.\nThere exists a chart \u03c61 \u2208 \u03a6 and a point y1 \u2208 B1 such that \u03c61 (y1 ) = \u03c6(y) =: x1 . Note that u \u25e6 \u03c61\nis differentiable at x1 , and define\nl1 := d(u \u25e6 \u03c61 )y1 = d(u \u25e6 \u03c6)y \u25e6 d(\u03c6\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c61 )y1 .\nThere exists a constant C > 1, which depends only on the atlas \u03a6, and such that\nkl1 k > (kl0 k \u2212 11K)/C.\n45\n\n\fIf l0 is large enough, then we have kl1 k > 11K, hence we can apply the lemma again, and find a\nchart \u03c62 , a point y2 \u2208 B2 and a linear form l2 . In addition, we have\nu \u25e6 \u03c62 (y2 ) <\n\ninf\n\n\u03c6(B1 )\u222a\u03c61 (B1 )\n\nu,\n\nso that the charts \u03c6, \u03c61 and \u03c62 are different. Now if kl0 k is sufficiently large, the process can\nbe continued further and we can build inductively, for 0 6 i 6 N , a sequence xi \u2208 B1 of points,\na sequence \u03c6i \u2208 \u03a6 of different charts, and a sequence li of linear forms such that kli+1 k >\n(kli k \u2212 11K)/C. The process can be continued as long as kli k > 11K. Recall that the cardinal\nof \u03a6 is finite, and denote it by |\u03a6|. Since all the charts involved in the construction above are\ndifferent, at most |\u03a6| steps can be performed. Hence there exists an integer N 6 |\u03a6| such that\nkli k > 11K for i < N , and klN k 6 11K. This gives a bound to klk, hence to kpk.\nlemma\n\nWe now finish the proof of the Theorem. Let us consider a smooth function g : Rd \u2212\u2192 R such\nthat 0 6 g 6 1, and such that g = 0 outside of B2 and g = 1 inside B1 . Since the K-semi-concave\nfunctions are equi-Lipschitz, and since the manifold M is compact, there exists a number \u2206 > 0\nsuch that\nmax u \u2212 min u 6 \u2206\nfor each K-semi-concave function u. Let us associate, to each chart \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, and each point\n(x, p) \u2208 Tx M satisfying x \u2208 \u03c6(B1 ), the function fx,p,\u03c6 : M \u2212\u2192 R defined by\n\u0001\nfx,p,\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c6(z) := g(z) p \u25e6 d\u03c6y (z \u2212 y) + Kkz \u2212 yk2 + (1 \u2212 g(z))\u2206\n\nfor z \u2208 B2 , where y = \u03c6\u22121 (x), and fx,p,\u03c6 = \u2206 outside of \u03c6(B2 ). The functions fx,p,\u03c6 , (x, p) \u2208\nLK , \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 form a bounded subset F of C 2 (M, R). For each K-semi-concave function u, let\nFu \u2282 F + R be the set of functions\nz 7\u2212\u2192 fx,p,\u03c6 (z) + u(x)\nwhere p is a K-super-differential of u at x. We claim that u = minf \u2208Fu f . In order to prove this\nclaim, observe that, for each y \u2208 B1 , \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6 and p a K-super-differential of u at x = \u03c6(y), we have\nfx,p,\u03c6 \u2212 u(x) > u\nwith equality at x. Indeed, we have the inequalities\nu \u25e6 \u03c6(z) \u2212 u(x) 6 p \u25e6 d\u03c6x (z \u2212 y) + Kkz \u2212 yk2\nfor z \u2208 B2 and u 6 u(x) + \u2206.\n\nB\n\ntheorem\n\nUniform families of Hamiltonians\n\nLet us fix once and for all a Riemann metric on the compact manifold M . We use this metric\nto define a norm |v| for tangent vectors, and a norm |p| for tangent covectors.\n(B.1) A family of pairs (H, L) of dual Hamiltonians and Lagrangians satisfying the hypotheses\n(1.1) and (1.2) is called uniform if:\n(i) There exist two superlinear functions h0 and h1 : R+ \u2212\u2192 R such that each Hamiltonian H\nof the family satisfies h0 (|p|) 6 H(t, x, p) 6 h1 (|p|).\n(ii) There exists an increasing function K(k) : R+ \u2212\u2192 R+ such that, if \u03c6 is the flow of a\nHamiltonian of the family and if the times t and s satisfy t \u2212 1 6 s 6 t + 1, then\n\u0001\n\u03c6st {|p| 6 k} \u2282 {|p| 6 K(k)} \u2282 T \u2217 M.\n46\n\n\f(iii) There exists a finite atlas \u03a8 of M such that, for each chart \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a8 and each Lagrangian L of\nthe family, we have kd2 (L \u25e6 T \u03c8)(t,x,v) k 6 K(k) for |v| 6 k.\nNote that condition (i) could have equivalently been replaced by the following:\n(i\u2032 ) There exist two superlinear functions l0 and l1 : R+ \u2212\u2192 R such that each Lagrangian L of\nthe family satisfies l0 (|v|) 6 L(t, x, v) 6 l1 (|v|).\n(B.2) The uniform families of highest use are the following. If H is a Hamiltonian, and if \u03c9\nis a bounded finite-dimensional convex family of closed one-forms on M , then the Hamiltonians\nH(t, x, p + \u03c9x ), \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 form a uniform family. Equivalently, the Lagrangians L(t, x, v) \u2212 \u03c9x (v) form\na uniform family.\n(B.3)\n\nIn a uniform family, we have\n|\u2202p H(t, x, p)| >\n\nh0 (|p|) \u2212 h1 (0)\n|p|\n\n|\u2202v L(t, x, v)| >\n\nl0 (|v|) \u2212 l1 (0)\n.\n|v|\n\nand\n\nIn other words, the Legendre transforms are uniformly proper.\nProof. In view of the convexity of H, we have\n|\u2202p H(t,x,p) | >\n\nH(t, x, p) \u2212 H(t, x, 0)\n.\n|p|\n\n(B.4) Given a Lagrangian L satisfying the hypotheses of (1.2), we define the function AL (t, x; s, y) :\nR \u00d7 M \u00d7 R \u00d7 M \u2212\u2192 R by\nZ s\nAL (t, x; s, y) =\ninf\nL(\u03c3, \u03b3(\u03c3), \u03b3\u0307(\u03c3)) d\u03c3,\n\u03b3\u2208\u03a3(t,x;s,y)\n\nt\n\nWhere \u03a3(t, x; s, y) is the set of absolutely continuous curves \u03b3 : [s, t] \u2212\u2192 M satisfying \u03b3(t) = x and\n\u03b3(s) = y. We denote by \u03a3L\nm (t, x; s, y) the set of curves of \u03a3(t, x; s, y) which realize the minimum.\n(B.5) For each uniform family of Lagrangians, there exists a decreasing function K1 (\u01eb) :]0, \u221e) \u2212\u2192\nR+ such that, if L is a Lagrangian of the family and if t and s are two real times satisfying t > s+\u01eb,\n2\nthen each curve \u03b3 \u2208 \u03a3L\nm (t, x; s, y) is C and satisfies |\u03b3\u0307(\u03c3)| 6 K(\u01eb) for each \u03c3 \u2208 [s, t].\nProof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that 0 < \u01eb < t \u2212 s < 1. By comparing the\naction of \u03b3 with that of a geodesic with the same endpoints, we get\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ t\nZ t\ndiam(M )\nl0 (|\u03b3\u0307(\u03c3)|)d\u03c3 6\nL(\u03c3, \u03b3(\u03c3), \u03b3\u0307(\u03c3))d\u03c3 6 (t \u2212 s)l1\nt\u2212s\ns\ns\nThe right hand side is clearly bounded by a constant which depends only of the parameters of the\nuniform family and of \u01eb. We obtain\n(t \u2212 s) min l0 (|\u03b3\u0307(\u03c3)|) 6 C,\nfrom which follows, with another constant C, that min |\u03b3\u0307(\u03c3)| 6 C. But then in view of (B.3), we\nhave\nmin |\u2202v L(\u03c3, \u03b3(\u03c3), \u03b3\u0307(\u03c3))| 6 C,\n\u03c3\u2208[s,t]\n\n47\n\n\fthen in view of (ii),\nmax |\u2202v L(\u03c3, \u03b3(\u03c3), \u03b3\u0307(\u03c3))| 6 C,\n\n\u03c3\u2208[s,t]\n\nso that finally, using (B.3) again, we get max |\u03b3\u0307| 6 C. We have used the symbol C for different\nconstants which depend only of \u01eb and of the parameters of the family.\nNote that the proof does not use (iii) in the definition of uniform families.\n(B.6)\n\nFor each times s < t, the mapping which, to a Lagrangian L, associates the function\n(x, y) 7\u2212\u2192 AL (s, x, t, y)\n\nof C(M \u00d7 M, R), is continuous on each uniform family of Lagrangians endowed with the topology\nof uniform convergence on compact sets.\nProof. Let L0 and L1 be two Lagrangians of the family.

Let us consider a finite atlas \u03a8 of M formed by charts \u03c8 : B6d \u2212\u2192 M , where Brd is the\nd\nEuclidean ball of radius r in Rd . Assume that the open sets \u03c8(B1/2\n), \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a8, cover M . Let \u03a6 be\n\u2032\n\u2032\nthe atlas of M \u00d7 M composed of products \u03c8 \u00d7 \u03c8 , with \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a8 and \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a8\u2032 . The charts \u03c6 of \u03a6 are\ndefined on B32d , and the images \u03c6(B12d ), \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, cover M \u00d7 M . In order to prove that the set U\u01eb is\nequi-semi-concave, we shall check that it is K-semi-concave for some K. So from now on we shall\nwork in a fixed chart \u03c6 = \u03c80 \u00d7 \u03c81 .\nLet (x0 , x1 ) be a point in \u03c80 (B2 ) \u00d7 \u03c81 (B2 ), and let y0 and y1 be the preimages in B2 . Let\n\u03b3(t) : [s, t] \u2212\u2192 M be a curve in \u03a3m (s, x0 ; t, x1 ). In view of (B.5), we have |\u03b3\u0307| 6 K1 (\u01eb). As a\nconsequence, there exists a constant a > 0, which depends only on the atlas, on the parameters of\nthe family, and of \u01eb, such that the curve \u03c80\u22121 \u25e6\u03b3 : [s, s+1/a] \u2212\u2192 B4d is well defined and a-Lipschitz,\nas well as the curve \u03c81\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b3 : [t \u2212 1/a, t] \u2212\u2192 B4d . Let us call y0 (\u03c3) and y1 (\u03c3) these curves, note\nthat y0 (s) = y0 and y1 (t) = y1 .
