INTRODUCTION\nA NED search for references to one of the\nhundred brightest AGN (e.g.\nPG quasars;\nBoroson & Green 1992, hereafter BG92) will frequently yield \u223c50-200 \"hits\", but among these one\nwill often find only very few papers dealing with optical/UV spectroscopy of that source. This is surprising especially if one considers that such spectra offer the most direct insights into the geometry and kinematics of the central broad and narrow\nline regions. Multiwavelength astronomy is apparently still in its infancy with most papers dealing\nwith monochromatic measures. While AGN unification schemes are popular\u2013up till recently\u2013no spectroscopic unification has existed for AGN. This is due to\n1 Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, 35487 USA; giacomo@merlot.astr.ua.edu.\n2 Osservatorio Astronomico di Padova, 35122 Padova,\nItalia.\n3 Instituto de Astronomia, UNAM, M\u00e9xico.\n\nEMISSION\n\nLINES\n\n-\n\nGALAX-\n\nat least two things: 1) until relatively recently few\nsources with moderate to high resolution and S/N\nspectroscopy existed for AGN and 2) there has been\na common belief that AGN spectra are basically the\nsame. The SDSS has ameliorated the former problem, although caution is required if one considers\nspectra for sources fainter than g\u223c17.5.\nWe have been searching for a spectroscopic unification embracing all broad line AGN for the past\n10+ years. Our hope was to find a diagnostic space\nthat could serve somewhat the same role as the H-R\nDiagram serves for stellar studies. The H-R Diagram\nfunctions well in 2D although its full power requires\nexploitation of more parameter dimensions. Certainly an equivalent spectroscopic diagnostic space\nfor quasars will require more than two dimensions\nif only to remove the degeneracy between source\nphysics and line-of-sight orientation \u2013 as drivers of\nmeasured source properties. This is a problem that\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSULENTIC ET AL.\n\ndoes not afflict the stellar H-R diagram. In 2000\nwe proposed a 4D Eigenvector 1 parameters space\n(Sulentic et al. 2000a,b, ; hereafter 4DE1) as the optimal vehicle for emphasizing spectroscopic diversity\nwhile at the same time contextualizing the diverse\ntypes of broad-line emitting sources.\nOur 4DE1 parameter space provides a potentially fundamental discrimination between major\nAGN classes. 4DE1 space (Sulentic et al. 2000a,b)\nincorporates all of the statistically significant line\nprofile similarities and differences that are currently\nknown. 4DE1 has roots in the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the Bright Quasar Sample\n(Eigenvector 1; BG92) as well as in correlations that\nemerged from ROSAT (e.g. Wang et al. 1996). 4DE1\nas we define it involves BG92 measures: 1) full width\nhalf maximum of broad H\u03b2 (FWHM H\u03b2) and 2)\nequivalent width ratio of optical FeII and broad H\u03b2:\nRF eII = W(FeII)/W(H\u03b2 BC ). We added 3) a measure of the soft X-ray photon index (\u0393sof t ) and 4)\na measure of CIV broad line profile displacement\nat half maximum (c(1/2)) to arrive at our 4DE1\nspace. Other points of departure from BG92 involve explicit comparison of RQ and RL sources as\nwell as subordination of [OIII] measures (although\nsee Zamanov et al. 2002; Marziani et al. 2003b). Finally we divide AGN into two populations using a\nsimple division at FWHM H\u03b2 BC =4000 km s\u22121 with\nsources narrower and broader than this value designated populations A and B, respectively. The latter\ndistinction was motivated by the observation that almost all RL sources show FWHM H\u03b2 BC >4000 km\ns\u22121 (Sulentic et al. 2000b). This distinction turns\nout to be more effective for highlighting spectroscopic differences than the more traditional divisions into: 1) RQ-RL sources and 2) NLSy1-BLSy1\nsources defined with FWHM H\u03b2 BC < and > 2000\nkm s\u22121 , respectively.\nAdopted 4DE1 key parameters were chosen with\nthe following two requirements in mind: 1) measures that showed large intrinsic variance (\u03a3) and\n2) measures that could be made with high precision (\u03c3). Many/most other spectroscopic measures show correlation in 4DE1 and/or pop.A-B dichotomy (e.g.optical Balmer line asymmetry, UV\nSIII]1892/CIII]1909 ratio, hard X-ray spectral index) but do not show large enough variance, or cannot be obtained for large enough numbers of sources\nwith suitable precision, to permit adoption as key\nparameters (e.g. \u03a3>20\u03c3). All line measures involve suitably corrected broad line components (reduction procedures are described in Marziani et al.\n1996, 2003a; Sulentic et al. 2007). In simplest terms\n\nthe key parameters can be said to measure: 1) the\ndispersion in (low ionization line) BLR cloud velocities, 2) the relative strengths of FeII and H\u03b2 emission, 3) the strength of a soft X-ray excess and 4)\nthe amplitude of systematic radial motions in (high\nionization line) BLR emitting gas. In less simple\nterms (i.e. more model dependent) we likely have:\n1) three or four orthogonal variables sensitive to the\nEddington ratio, 2) two or three variables sensitive\nto source inclination, as well as 3) one variable sensitive to black hole mass (FWHM) and another to\nnebular physics (ne : RF eII ). Taken together they\noffer the most direct clues about the geometry and\nkinematics of the broad line region (BLR).\nSource occupation in principal planes of 4DE1\ncan be found in Sulentic et al. (2000a,b, 2007).\nThese studies have made use of ground based optical\nspectra for the H\u03b2 region, HST archival FOS/STIS\nUV spectra for the region of CIV and ROSAT Xray spectra. We have recently (Zamfir et al. 2008\nin preparation) exploited the SDSS database which\noffers major advantages: 1) uniform, high resolution\n(\u223c1\u00c5) and high S/N spectra for the 300+ brightest quasars and 2) broad wavelength coverage (30009000\u00c5). Our adopted redshift limit z=0.7 allows\nmeasures of H\u03b2 and neighboring lines. This has\ngreatly expanded the number of bright quasars in\nthe magnitude and color range of the PG. It also\nprovides a sample with the proper ratio of RL to RQ\nsources. Uniform FIRST radio measures allow us to\nexplore the differences between RQ and RL sources\nwith a highly complete (\u223c80%; see Jiang et al. 2007)\nsample. Figure 1 offers an introduction to the optical plane of 4DE1 in the light of the SDSS era and\nit is reassuring to note that source occupation confirms our previous work. Similarly we describe preliminary X-ray results that come from the growing\nXMM-NEWTON spectroscopic sample. We attempt\nto summarize here the many insights that 4DE1 offers as a diagnostic space that offers a clearer context\nin which to interpret individual sources.\n1) 4DE1 makes clear that broad line emitting\nAGN show a wide range of spectroscopic properties\n\u2013 they are not all alike \u2013 the intrinsic dispersion in\n4DE1 parameters is much larger than measurement\nerrors. The cross in the upper right corner of Figure\n1 indicates typical (median) measurement uncertainties which correspond roughly to 3\u03c3. FWHM H\u03b2\nmeasures range from 1000 (smallest known \u223c 630\nkm s\u22121 ; Grupe et al. 1999) to \u223c23000 km s\u22121 in our\nsample (largest known \u223c40000 km s\u22121 ; Wang et al.\n2005, in H\u03b1) and RF eII measures from 0 to \u223c1.8\n(most extreme known RF eII \u223c6; Lipari et al. 1993).\n\n\fREVMEXAA(SC) OUR SEARCH FOR AN H-R DIAGRAM OF QUASARS\n\n3\n\n12000\n\nRQ\nRL - FRII\nRL - CD\n\n-1\n\nFWHM H\u03b2BC(km s )\n\n10000\n\n8000\n\n6000\n\nPop.B\n4000\n\nPop.A\n2000\n\n0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\nRFeII\nFig. 1. The SDSS bright quasar sample in the optical plane of 4DE1 space.\n\nNote that SDSS calls sources with FWHM H\u03b2<1000\nkm s\u22121 galaxies rather than quasars and FeII emitters with RFE>1.8 were rarely found in the SDSS\nquasar catalog. They are extremely red objects\n(strong IRAS sources as well; see Lipari et al. 1993;\nV\u00e9ron-Cetty et al. 2006) and they require a special\nanalysis of the FeII emission. These objects are\ntherefore not included in our sample. We regard detection of (broad) FeII emission as a requirement for\nType 1 quasar status. Our previous work involved\nmany more sources with RF eII upper limits reflecting\nthe sensitivity of FeII detection to continuum s/n especially for broader line sources (see Marziani et al.\n2003a, Figure 3). SDSS spectra for bright quasars\nreveal less than 1% of broad-line emitting sources\nwith undetected FeII emission suggesting that FeII\nemission is an ubiquitous property of Type 1 AGN.\nFigure 1 tells us that average quasar spectra\nthat do not allow for the wide observed parameter\ndispersion are somewhat like average stellar spectra involving the entire OBAFGKM sequence (see\nSulentic et al. 2002, 2007; Bachev et al. 2004, ;Zamfir et al. 2008 in preparation) for average spectra in\nthe 4DE1 context).\n2) Earlier studies (Sulentic et al. 2000a,b) suggested that the RQ majority of AGN showed a\nlarger 4DE1 domain space occupation region than\n\nRL sources and this is well confirmed with the SDSS\nsample. RQ sources (grey filled symbols in Figure 1)\nform what can be described as a correlation \"main\nsequence\". There is a large parameter domain where\nno sources are found. In other words we see a large\ndispersion in parameter measures but a restricted\ndispersion in combinations of these measures (e.g.\nno broad Balmer line profiles [FWHM H\u03b2> 8000 km\ns\u22121 ] with strong FeII emission [RFE>0.4]). Narrow\nLine Seyfert 1 sources (NLSy1) do not emerge as\na distinct class but rather as the lower edge of the\nRQ sequence. If there is a division or dichotomy in\nsource properties it occurs near FWHM H\u03b2=4000\nkm s\u22121 .\n3) RL sources (blue filled squares/green open circles) occupy one end of the RQ sequence and overlap\nwith about 25% of RQ sources. This domain space\nseparation is highly significant (P\u223c3\u00d710\u22127 that RQ\nand RL occupy the same domain; Zamfir et al. 2008)\nand credible because we are dealing with unusually\ncomplete/balanced RQ and RL samples. These are\ntherefore the only RQ sources that are spectroscopically indistinguishable from RL AGN. We define a\nsource as RL if logL20cm (ergs\u22121 Hz \u22121 )=31.5 (this\nis approximately a radio/optical flux density ratio\nRK =70; Kellermann et al. 1989). This corresponds\nto the radio properties of the weakest observed\n\n\f4\n\nSULENTIC ET AL.\n\ndouble-lobed (assumed unbeamed in an orientation\nunification scenario) source in our old and new samples (Sulentic et al. 2003, Zamfir et al. 2008). The\nprobability of radio loudness in Figure 1 increases\nfrom P\u223c0.01 at the extreme RQ end of the source\nsequence (where NLSy1 are found; Komossa et al.\n2006 estimates P\u223c0.025 for NLSy1) to P\u223c0.15-0.18\nat the opposite end where the vast majority of RL\nsources are found.\n4) Few RL sources are found below FWHM\nH\u03b2 BC =4000 km s\u22121 . Those that do likely involve sources where the putative accretion disk is\nseen face-on (and radio jets pole-on) (Sulentic et al.\n2003, Zamfir et al. 2008). We can infer this because\nwe see a separation between the majority of coredominated sources (CD\u2013filled squares) and lobedominated (LD\u2013open circles) emission. Most RL\nsources with large and small FWHM H\u03b2 values are\nlobe- and core-dominated (alternatively steep and\nflat radio spectrum sources) respectively again as expected from simple orientation unification schemes\n(e.g. Urry & Padovani 1995; Orr & Browne 1982)\nwhere Balmer emission arises in a flattened cloud\ndistribution (usually called an accretion disk) and\nthe radio-jets are aligned perpendicular to the cloud\ndistribution. Red arrows in Figure 1 indicate the\nmedian displacement in 4DE1 optical plane coordinates between FRII and CD sources in the old and\nnew source samples (Sulentic et al. 2003, Zamfir et\nal. 2008). This is consistent with LD sources viewed\nas the (misaligned) parent population of RL sources\nand with CD sources as the aligned (near pole-on\nand Doppler boosted) sources. Some CD (largest\nFWHM) and LD (smallest FWHM) sources do not\nfollow the clear trend indicated by the red arrows in\nFigure 1. These likely represent the (about 10-15%\nin our RL sample) \"misaligned\" sources where the\nradio jets are far from perpendicular to the accretion disk plane.\n5) All reasonably resolved LD sources in our\nSDSS sample show FRII morphology suggesting that\nFRI sources are rare among broad-line RL emitters.\nSome weak FRI sources may be present among the\nRQ sources but they show extreme core/lobe ratios and are effectively filtered out of the FIRST\nsurvey (dynamic range limits and spatial frequency\nattenuation). We find no evidence for a significant radio-intermediate population bridging the RQ\nand RL sources. While weak radio jets are observed in some RQ quasars (e.g. Ulvestad et al. 2005;\nLeipski et al. 2006), the majority show radio emission dominated by star formation in the host galaxies (e.g. PG quasars follow the radio-FIR correla-\n\nFig. 2. Our bright quasar sample in a UV \u2013 X-ray plane\nof 4DE1 space. Dashed lines are 2\u03c3 confidence intervals\nfor zero CIV shift.\n\ntion; see Haas et al. 2003). There is no evidence\nfor a continuum of radio jet properties from largely\nLD RL to largely CD RQ sources although a few\nRQ show unusually strong radio jet-lobe structures\n(e.g. Garc\u0131\u0301a-Baretto et al. 2002). The strongest support for this conclusion comes from 4DE1 (Figure 1)\nwhere RL sources show a preferred domain space occupation relative to the RQ majority.\n6) There may be two AGN populations: 1) a\n\"pure\" RQ population A which shows little overlap with the RL domain (e.g. it includes \u223c70%\nof the RQ sample) and 2) a mixed RL-RQ population B (\u223c30% of the RQ sources and almost all RL\nsources). We recently summarized (Sulentic et al.\n2007) the empirical (and inferred theoretical differences) between pop. A and B sources which, in fact,\nencompass almost all existing multiwavelength measures of AGN. A recent comparison between FWHM\nand line dispersion (2nd moment of the profile) measurements for H\u03b2 has accidentally confirmed our\ntwo population hypothesis (Collin et al. 2006). Focussing on the key 4DE1 parameters we can say\nthat Pop. A sources show relatively narrow singlecomponent Balmer lines, strong FeII emission, a CIV\nblueshift and a soft X-ray excess. Pop. B sources\nshow broader, and often more complex, Balmer lines,\nweak FeII emission and absence of a CIV blueshift\nor soft X-ray excess.\nAverage Balmer line spectra in the 4DE1 context (Sulentic et al. 2002) require a minimum of two\n\n\fREVMEXAA(SC) OUR SEARCH FOR AN H-R DIAGRAM OF QUASARS\nGaussian components for a reasonable model fit.\nAside from the relatively unshifted component assumed to be the \"classical\" BLR we find a broader\nand redshifted (VBLR- Very Broad Line Region)\ncomponent. The latter component is dangerous for\nreverberation studies and BH mass estimation because it responds to continuum changes differently\nthan the classical BLR (Sulentic et al. 2000c). At\nthe upper extreme of optical 4DE1 space we find a\nvery small number (<1%) of sources showing doublepeaked Balmer line profiles. While they have been\ninterpreted a a direct signature of accretion disk line\nemission (Eracleous & Halpern 1994) there are many\nproblems with this hypothesis (Sulentic et al. 1999;\nSulentic 2006). The situation is reversed for UV high\nionization line profiles like CIV1549. Pop. A sources\nrequire unshifted and blueshifted components while\npop. B sources show stronger and less shifted line\nprofiles. Extreme pop. A sources are sometimes\ndominated by the blueshifted component.\nCIV measures have been clouded in controversy for many years with much of the disagreement centered on the reality and strength of a narrow CIV emission component (Sulentic & Marziani\n1999). We recently presented a recipe for reasonable\nCIV narrow component subtraction (Sulentic et al.\n2007) and show that corrected broad line measures\nclarify our picture of high ionization line emission\nproperties in AGN.\n7) Figure 2 shows the current best CIV-\u0393sof t\n4DE1 plane which illustrates two of the pop. AB differences summarized above. Figure 2 suggests\nthat pop. B sources show a much stronger domain\nspace concentration than pop. A. RF eII and CIV\nshift (c(1/2)) measures also show this concentration.\nWhile pop. A sources show considerable scatter in\nall 4DE1 measures, pop B sources show this scatter\nonly in measures of FWHM H\u03b2. This may be telling\nus that the physics/geometry/kinematics of pop. B\nsources is much more similar from source-to-source.\nThis makes some sense if we view pop. B sources as\nthe end phase of quasar evolution when the accretion\nrate is low.\nX-ray measures shown in Figure 2 are based\nlargely on archival ROSAT observations. We have\nonly begun to harvest the new generation of XMMNewton X-ray measures. Three recent papers have\nanalyzed strongly overlapping samples of PG quasars\nranging from 20-40 sources (Porquet et al. 2004;\nBrocksopp et al. 2006; Piconcelli et al. 2005). These\nsamples allow a preliminary test of earlier inferences\nthat motivated us to adopt \u0393sof t as a key 4DE1 parameter. Table 1 summarizes a comparison of mean\n\n5\n\nTABLE 1\n\nPop.\nA\nB\n\nPiconcelli\u2013single power-law fit\nN\n\u03932\u221212keV\n\u03930.3\u221212keV\n22\n1.94\n2.71\n11\n1.66\n1.88\n\nPourquet/Brocksopp/Piconcelli\u2013broken power-law fit\nPop.\nN\n\u0393sof t\n\u0393hard\nA\n14/14/13 2.825/2.86/2.98 2.07/2.13/1.39\nB\n7/6/8\n2.31/2.61/2.75 1.795/1.82/1.38\nXMM measures for PG quasars observed so far. We\nrestrict this preview to low z PG quasars (included\nin BG92) for the following two reasons: 1) higher\nredshift PG sources, assumed to have similar intrinsic X-ray luminosity, will yield lower s/n spectra on\naverage and 2) we have no FWHM H\u03b2 or RF eII\nmeasures for higher z PG sources precluding a contextualization in 4DE1 space. We immediately distinguish between our so-called population A and B\nsources. Even if this distinction turns out not to\nbe fundamental in the sense of physically discrete\nquasar classes it has proven effective for highlighting\ndifferences across the 4DE1 sequence.\nThe largest difference between pop. A and B\nsources involves comparison over the largest energy\nrange (0.3-12keV). The pop. A-B soft photon index difference is larger than the one reported in the\ndefining papers of the 4DE1 concept (Sulentic et al.\n2000a,b). It is also 3\u00d7 larger than the A-B difference\nin the \"harder\" 2-12keV energy range. This was the\nmotivation for suggesting that only pop. A sources\nshow a soft X-ray excess. XMM measures confirm\nthe ROSAT derived pop. A-B difference and Table\n1 shows that the mean soft 0.3-12 keV index for pop.\nB sources is similar to harder pop. A-B indices derived over the 0.3-12keV range. Despite claims that\nall PG quasars show a soft excess, this result suggests\nthat pop. B source do not.\nSingle power-law fits to PG X-ray spectra are\ngenerally poor which motivated the above studies\nto consider broken power-laws providing both hard\nand soft photon indices as given in Table 1. We\nsee some evidence for a stronger pop A-B difference\nin the soft band however there is considerable variance among the three studies. If we restrict the\nBrocksopp et al. 2006 sample to broken power-law\nfits with the best \u03c72 solutions we find a soft component pop. A-B difference \u2206=3.0-2.5\u223c0.5 which\nsupports a pop. A soft excess at a K-S significance\nlevel P=0.002. Sigma values are 0.6 and 0.3 also\n\n\f6\n\nSULENTIC ET AL.\n\nconfirming the smaller scatter among pop B sources\nmentioned above. Clearly we need more X-ray spectra for low z PG quasars.\nAs also reported earlier (Sulentic et al. 2000a,b)\na (smaller) difference is seen for harder X-ray measures in the Piconcelli et al. 2005 sample. Pop.\nB sources show a harder spectrum than pop. A\nsources in most of the XMM studies. All three XMM\nstudies report correlations between FWHM H\u03b2 and\nsoft/hard measures confirming the correlation that\nwe found with a larger (n=112) ROSAT sample\n(Sulentic et al. 2000a,b). The apparently continuous correlation may be telling us that Pop. A-B are\nsimply the ends of single AGN sequence rather than\ntwo distinct classes.\nThe \"soft X-ray excess\" has been widely interpreted as the thermal signature of an accretion disk (Pounds et al. 1995). This interpretation\nis reasonable within the 4DE1 context where the\nstrongest soft excess is found among sources with\nthe the smallest black hole masses and highest accretion rates (highest L/LEdd) Following this reasoning Piconcelli et al. (2005) explored composite model\nfits. It is interesting that models employing a powerlaw+bremstrahlung yielded a much larger pop. A-B\ndifference (kT=0.02 vs. 0.07) than models employing a power-law+black body. If the pop. A-B difference is real then this may be telling us that the\nthermal disk interpretation is incorrect or too simple.\nBrocksopp et al. (2006) reached a similar conclusion\nusing a different argument. It has been known for\na long time that the pop. A soft excess implies too\nhigh temperatures which has motivated some to explore Comptonized disk models (e.g. Haardt et al.\n1994).\nTwo conclusions/comments from the XMM studies (Piconcelli et al. 2005) require a response within\nthe 4DE1 context. A) A RL-RQ difference could suggest the presence of an extra continuum contribution\nfrom self synchrotron jet emission (Zamorani et al.\n1981). 4DE1: We suggest that the few RL sources in\nPG preclude statistically useful inferences. However\nin 4DE1 context we know that RQ pop. B sources\nshow very similar properties to the (largely pop. B)\nRL sources. Our much larger ROSAT sample shows\nthis statement to be reasonable. This motivated us\nto opine that since RQ pop. B sources show the same\nspectra as RL sources there is no evidence for an Xray component related to a sources radio-loudness.\nB) None of the two component models gives a satisfactory fit for all sources. This result suggests that\nthe shape of the soft excess is not a universal QSO\nproperty. 4DE1: The population A-B distinction is\n\nvery useful here because it suggests that there are\ntwo fundamentally different kinds of X-ray emitting\nquasars. Thew soft X-ray excess is only a property\nof one of these populations.\n8) We recently harvested from the HST archive\nall UV spectra (n=130 sources) covering the\nCIV\u03bb1549 region. We find mean CIV profile shifts\n(at FWHM) of -677 km s\u22121 and -39 km s\u22121 respectively for pop. A and B sources confirming the\noriginal motivation for adopting this measure as a\nkey 4DE1 parameter (Sulentic et al. 2000b, 2007).\nThe blueshift of high ionization UV emission lines\nis therefore concentrated in sources with FWHM\nH\u03b2<4000 km s\u22121 . This means that it is a largely\nRQ phenomenon (mean CIV profile shifts for RQ and\nRL sources are -582 km s\u22121 and +52 km s\u22121 , respectively); CIV equivalent width also shows a striking\npop. A-B difference: 117\u00c5 and 57\u00c5, respectively.\nWe recently discovered an apparent correlation between CIV FWHM and EW measures, but only for\npop. A sources. As mentioned earlier most pop. B\nsources show CIV shift/EW, RF eII and \u0393sof t measures that are identical within measurement uncertainties. We hope to exploit CIV measures as an\norientation indicator using this new correlation. It is\nnow well known that the Baldwin effect is dominated\nby intrinsic (we would say 4DE1) rather than cosmological effects (Bachev et al. 2004; Baskin & Laor\n2004).\nPHYSICAL INFERENCES: We have described some of the empirical results connected with\nthe four key parameters defining 4DE1 space. 4DE1\nis the most effective spectroscopic unifier available,\nat the same time it emphasizes the differences between AGN. We have also begun to explore the\nphysical implications of 4DE1 (Marziani et al. 2001,\n2003b) and suggest the following theoretical inferences from the empiricism; adopting a model where\nlow ionization broad lines (e.g. broad H\u03b2 and FeII\nemission) arise in a photoionized medium in or near\nan accretion disk. Simple models then allow us\nto use: a) line reverberation to infer the radius of\nthe broad line region (Kaspi et al. 2000, 2005), b)\nline FWHM or dispersion to infer the BH mass (assuming a virialized medium: Marziani et al. 2003b;\nCollin et al. 2006; Sulentic 2006) and c) RF eII to infer the density of the FeII emitting medium that is\nas dense as or denser than the region producing H\u03b2\n(Marziani et al. 2001, and this volume). The Eddington ratio emerges from b) + source bolometric luminosity. The most useful summary statement\nhere might be a comparison of median inferred properties for pop. A and B sources. Table 2 summarizes\n\n\fREVMEXAA(SC) OUR SEARCH FOR AN H-R DIAGRAM OF QUASARS\nTABLE 2\n\nInferred Physical Properties\nQUANTITY POP\u2013A POP\u2013B\nlog nE\n11.5\n9.5\nlog U\n-1.5\n-1.0\nlog MBH\n7.7\n9.0\nL/LEdd\n0.3\n0.08\n\n7\n\nular to the disk plane where Keplerian rotation dominate. The much smaller velocity dispersion in pop.\nA sources is consistent with the idea of a highly flattened distribution. Either pop. B sources are much\nless flattened or there is an additional emission component producing the much higher observed velocity\ndispersion perpendicular to the disk. A more extreme alternative would see line emission in pop. B\nsources arising entirely in a non-disk configuration.\n\nFig. 3. Inferred physical trends along the quasar sequence in the optical plane of 4DE1 space.\n\nNote that the \"face-on\" value for pop. A sources\nis set by the lower limit of observed FWHM H\u03b2\n(with FeII emission corroborating that the source is\nan AGN and that a dense enough medium exists to\naccount for the strong FeII emission). The \"edgeon\" value of FWHM H\u03b2 for pop. A is set by the fact\nthat sources with RF eII >0.4 (unambiguously Pop.\nA) show FWHM H\u03b2<4000 km s\u22121 . The situation is\nless confused for pop. B sources because we can infer\nthe range of FWHM H\u03b2 from RL sources via radio\nmorphology and core/lobe flux ratios (Rokaki et al.\n2003; Sulentic et al. 2003). We then assume that\npop. B RQ sources follow RL pop. B because they\nare co-spatial in 4DE1. Pop. B sources start to\nbecome rare at about FWHM H\u03b2=104 km/s. If we\nassume the same range of viewing angle for pop. A\nand pop. B sources then we observe velocity ranges\nof a factor of \u223c5 and \u223c2.5 for pop. A and B respectively, consistent with a flatter pop. A emitting\ncloud distribution.\n\nthe inferred pop. A-B values taken from the following papers: Marziani et al. 2001, 2003b; Sulentic\n2006. Figure 3 also shows some of the inferred physical trends thought to drive source occupation in the\noptical plane of 4DE1. See also the review by P.\nMarziani in this volume.\nCollin et al. (2006) recently argued that a thin\nflat BLR disk structure could be ruled out. We usually assume that H\u03b2, and especially FeII, in high\naccreting pop. A sources arise in a flatter distribution than pop. B. This assumption is motivated by\nempiricism. We can either: 1) compare the typical\nFWHM H\u03b2 values for the most face-n pop. A and\nB sources or 2) the dispersion in observed FWHM\nvalues for each population assuming that we observe\nthe BLR over the same range of viewing angles (e.g.\n0\u25e6 to 45\u25e6 ). We also assume that H\u03b2 and FeII emission arise from rather similar cloud distributions because FWHM FeII \u223c FWHM H\u03b2. The narrowest\npop. A and B sources show FWHM H\u03b2\u223c 800 km\ns\u22121 and 4000 km s\u22121 , respectively. These are then\nassumed to be the \"face-on\" values for the two populations and are measuring motions largely perpendic-\n\nThe typical inferred properties in Table 2 are representative of our current understanding of sources\nwith z\u22640.8. Unfortunately the H\u03b2 spectral region cannot be studied from the ground beyond\nz\u223c1.0 (z=0.7 for SDSS spectra) without major effort. Ground based CIV measures have been extensively used to extract MBH and other properties out\nto much higher redshift (z\u223c4.0). Our own studies of\nthe CIV line using the HST archive suggest that CIV\ncannot be trusted for MBH estimation for many reasons (Sulentic et al. 2007; Netzer et al. 2007): 1) the\nobvious Malmquist bias associated with CIV measures for any optically selected sample, 2) the complexity of the CIV profile and properties reflected in\npop. A-B profile differences and the lack of a clear\ncorrelation between FWHM H\u03b2 \u2013 FWHM (CIV) and\n3) especially for the pop. A (majority) of RQ sources\n- the blueshifted and blue asymmetric profile shapes\nwhich must raise doubts that the high ionization\nUV lines arise in a virialized medium. Sources with\na strong narrow line component (likely more common among pop. B sources if lines like [OIII]\u03bb5007\nare any guide) tend to give a false sense of security because they make CIV profiles look more sym-\n\n\f8\n\nSULENTIC ET AL.\n\nmetric and less blueshifted. Recent observations of\nhigh z type 2 AGN reveal frequent and reasonable\nstrong CIV narrow line emission (see references in\nSulentic et al. 2007).\nWe have chosen to make a major effort with VLT\nISAAC and now have IR spectra of the H\u03b2 region for\n50+ sources between z=0.8-2.5. VLT enables us to\nobtain IR spectra with resolution and s/n similar to\nground based spectra for lower redshift sources. Results so far suggest that source occupation in 4DE1\nspace is similar up to the B= -29 to -30 source luminosity range. Much remains to be done but 4DE1\nspace continues to offer a useful way to contextualize both empirical and physical properties of quasars.\nIt offers the hope of simplifying or resolving many of\nthe current questions about these most active objects.\nWe thank the organizers for the opportunity to\nspeak in Huatlulco where we celebrated the birthday\nof Deborah Dultzin who has been a member of our\ncollaboration for 10+ years.\nREFERENCES\nBachev, R., Marziani, P., Sulentic, J.
