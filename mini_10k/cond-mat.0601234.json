BOX 808, Livermore, CA 94550\nPACS numbers: 44.10.+i, 44.35.+c\n\nIn a recent letter [1], Kumar et al. outline a model for thermal transport in nanofluids that purports to explain\nthe anomalous thermal conductivity enhancements observed experimentally. Since this effect is expected to have\nsignificant technological consequences and may already be relevant for certain applications [2] this is an important\nexercise. Unfortunately, the model of Kumar et al. falls short on several conceptual counts.\nThe authors start by considering the case of fixed solid particles and postulate the existence of \"two parallel paths\nof heat flow\", one through the suspending liquid and the other through the dispersed solid. This is a questionable\nassumption, particularly for the extremely dilute suspensions against which they wish to test their model. By pursuing\nthis argument along an approximate derivation Kumar et al. produce a relation for the effective thermal conductivity\nof the nanofluid, Eq. 7 of [1], which includes a dependence on the radiuses of the solid particles, rp , and liquid\nmolecules, rm :\n\u0015\n\u0014\nkp \u01ebrm\n(1)\nkef f = km 1 +\nkm (1 \u2212 \u01eb)rp\n,where kp and km are the thermal conductivities of the solid and liquid respectively, and \u01eb is the volume fraction of\nthe dispersed solid particles. One problem with the above relation is immediately apparent if we notice that at fixed\n\u01eb, rm /rp \u2192 0 implies kef f /km \u2192 1, i.e. the solid inclusions have no effect on the thermal conductivity if they are\nmuch larger than the liquid molecules. In fact, this situation is rigorously described by theories that treat the liquid\nas a continuum and where accurate, widely accepted results are available for all \u01eb [3]. The dependence of Eq. 1 on\nkp /km is very different from these results even at rm /rp > 0. For example, if the solid clusters are much less thermally\nconducting than the liquid, kp /km \u2192 0, Eq. 1 predicts kef f /km \u2192 1, while if they are much more conducting,\nkp /km \u2192 \u221e, it yields kef f /km \u2192 \u221e, both independently of \u01eb (and rm /rp ), and both of which can only be deemed\nincorrect.\nA dependence of kef f on rp can arise for example due to liquid-solid interface thermal resistance [4], even when\nthe liquid can be treated as a continuum. Furthermore, as rp /rm decreases the effective volume fraction of the solid\nparticles, e.g. approximated by \u01ebef f = \u01eb(1+rm /rp )3 for \u01eb \u226a 1, should also perhaps replace \u01eb in conductivity estimates,\nintroducing an additional dependence on rp . However, Eq. 1 captures no such effects and fails some simple tests.\nKumar et al. consider next the effect of the solid particles motion. To this end they invoke kinetic theory and\nintroduce c\u016bp as the \"thermal conductivity of the particle\", where \u016bp is an \"average particle velocity\". Their complete\nthermal conductivity model is obtained by replacing kp in Eq. 1 with c\u016bp . This is quite problematic since it has\nthe effect of eliminating kp as a parameter in determining the nanofluid thermal conductivity, and thus makes the\nprevious analysis for fixed solid clusters rather futile. For example, if \u016bp \u2192 0, .e.g. the suspending liquid is frozen,\nkef f \u2192 km , i.e. the solid inclusions have no effect on kef f irrespective of kp and \u01eb, when this case should reduce to\nthe fixed particles problem.\nIn fact, c\u016bp cannot be interpreted at all as the thermal conductivity of a solid particle. By the authors own kinetic\ntheory arguments k\u2032 = c\u016bp is the thermal conductivity of a dilute gas of particles that possess internal energy [5].\nIn principle, a quantity like k\u2032 could provide an estimate for direct, Brownian motion transport of heat by the solid\nclusters, but it should not supplant kp , the thermal conductivity of the solid. Unfortunately, the k\u2032 calculated in\n[1] is inadequate even for this purpose. It is not clear why the authors definition of \u016bp would be appropriate in the\ngiven context, while their estimate of the \"constant\" c \u221d nlcv (which is not dimensionless as conveyed in the paper),\nwith n - number density of the solid particles, l - their \"mean-free path\" and cv - heat capacity of a solid particle,\napparently assumes l \u221d 1/nd2p , dp = 2rp , which only takes into account the rare collisions between the solid particles\nand ignores the effect of the liquid. A more reasonable estimate for k\u2032 is k\u2032 \u2243 nDcv , with D = kB T /3\u03c0\u03b7dp - StokesEinstein relation. This yields for dp = 10nm gold particles in water at normal conditions and \u01eb = 1%, k\u2032/km \u2243 10\u22126 .\nTherefore, the direct Brownian motion contribution to thermal transport can be safely ignored for nanofluids. Finally,\nthe theoretical values plotted by the authors in their Fig. 4 are off by orders of magnitude from their own formula\nEq. 10, purportedly used to calculate them.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.
