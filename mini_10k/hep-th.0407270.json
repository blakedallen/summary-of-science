The propagation of an open string for large times is found\nto be very strongly suppressed.\n\n1\n\n\fIntroduction\nD-branes are maybe the most fascinating and still somewhat mysterious objects\nin string theory. In particular the precise quantum nature of the branes is not\nentirely clear: in perturbative string theory they appear as boundary conditions\nfor the open string, while in the low energy effective field theories or string field\ntheory (SFT) they appear as solitonic solutions to the equations of motion. The\nanalogy with solitons in ordinary quantum field theory is in this respect slightly\nmisleading, since solitons there never appear as additional degrees of freedom.\nFrom the SFT perspective one could argue similarly, yet there are some glitches\nin the picture \u2013 attempts to find a solution of SFT describing two D25 branes\nhave failed so far [1]. So it is not clear what is the complete set of degrees of\nfreedom. Indeed sometimes it can be convenient to use the solitons as alternative\ndegrees of freedom instead of the fundamental fields. However, from the point\nof view of perturbative string theory, D-branes seem more like heavy (charged)\nparticles which in the end have to be included as full quantum fields in a consistent\nquantum theory. The question of how in detail to quantize the D-branes is still\nopen but has to be eventually addressed in order to have a complete theory.\nOne meets (mild) versions of the quantum nature of the D-branes for instance\nin the study of D-brane recoil, but also in the toy models encountered in noncritical string theory for c \u2264 1. In particular the case c = 1 has been much studied\nsince it corresponds to 2d critical string theory in a linear dilaton background,\nand the D0 branes, as noted in [2, 3], can be viewed as the eigenvalues in the c = 1\nmatrix model. With this interpretation the decay of an (unstable) D0-brane of\nthe 2d bosonic string theory is described by a tachyon moving in a potential (we\nchoose \u03b1\u2032 = 1)\nT2\nV =\u2212 ,\n(1)\n2\nand the quantum description of a single D0-brane is dictated by the Hamiltonian\nH =\u2212\n\n1 d2\n+ V (T ),\n2 dT 2\n\n1\nV (T ) = \u2212 T 2 .\n2\n\n(2)\n\nThe c = 1 matrix model can be used to analyze the decay of the D0-brane\ninto closed string tachyons. In this calculation (as in Sen's original calculation\nin critical string theory) one only uses the classical aspects of the open string\ntheory, here specifically that a classical solution in the potential (1) is given by\nTcl (t) = T0 cosh t.\n\n(3)\n\nThis is an exact counterpart of the rolling tachyon background [4] in critical\nbosonic strings in 26 dimensions.\n2\n\n\fIn fact, in such a calculation one finds that the number of emitted (closed\nstring) particles diverges logarithmically and the expectation value of the emitted\nenergy diverges linearly. This is true for the decay of D0-branes both in the\nc = 1 theory and in critical string theory. In the c = 1 theory the situation\ncould be analyzed further since the quantum theory of the D0-branes is known.\nClearly the classical picture of D0-brane decay is only approximate, limited by\nthe uncertainty principle, and it was suggested in [2] that by considering wave\npackets rather than the localized eigenvalues corresponding to (3) one would avoid\nthe divergence caused by the classical open string background. This was verified\nin detail in [5] and in this article we discuss the extension of the results in [5] to\ncritical bosonic string theory.\n\nThe quantum boundary action\nLet us first review the 2d calculation. The amplitude for emission of closed string\ntachyons is given by an expression\nZ\nA(E) \u223c lim (leg factor) dt eiEt htr e\u2212il\u03a6(t) iM\n(4)\nl\u21920\n\nwhere the so called \"leg factor\" is unimportant to us and where\nZ\n\u2212il\u03a6(t)\nhtr e\niM \u2261 dT \u03c1(T, t) e\u2212ilT ,\n\n(5)\n\n\u03a6 is a N \u00d7 N matrix (where N \u2192 \u221e) and \u03c1(T, t) is the eigenvalue density of \u03a6.\nThe contribution from the classical rolling tachyon is obtained by the substitution\n\u03c1(T, t) \u2192 \u03b4(T \u2212 Tcl (t)). Thus one ends up calculating the integral\nZ\ndt eiEt e\u2212ilTcl (t) .\n(6)\nAs shown in [5] this integral gave precisely the closed tachyon emission amplitude\n(4) obtained using continuum BCFT methods in the case of a decaying classical\nD0-brane. But in fact the true physical object is the quantum D0-brane, which\nis described by a wavefunction \u03c8(T, t) \u2013 satisfying the appropriate Schroedinger\nequation. The closed string emission can then be calculated using the replacement\nZ\n\u2212ilTcl (t)\n\u2212ilT\ne\n\u2192 e\n\u2261 dT |\u03c8(T, t)|2e\u2212ilT .\n(7)\n\u03c8(t)\nLet us now turn to the calculation of the decay of D-branes in critical (bosonic)\nstring theory. The dominant source of D-brane instability is the tachyon field\n3\n\n\fmode T (t, ~x). It lives on the boundary of the world sheet and gives rise to a\nboundary action\nZ\nSb =\nd\u03c4 T (t, ~x),\n(8)\nB\n\nwhere the integration is along the string boundary. Let us expand the tachyonic field in momentum modes, where for simplicity we compactify the spatial\ndirections to a box with volume V = Lp for a Dp-brane:\n\u0010\n\u0010\nX\nx\u0011\nx\u0011\n1\nc\ns\nT\n(t)\n*\ncos\n2\u03c0n\n+\nT\n(t)\n*\nsin\n2\u03c0n\n(9)\nT (t, ~x) =\np\n~\nn\n~\nn\nL\nL\n(2\u03c0L) 2 ~n\nWe now need the spacetime action for the tachyon field. We will consider just the\nfree quadratic part of Witten's OSFT, thus we assume that gs is small. We will\nthen treat this spacetime action quantum-mechanically. We still expect nontrivial\nquantum effects even using just the free SFT. Indeed in [5], in the 2d string case,\nwe observed that quantum effects were very important even before including the\neffects of string interactions (the Fermi sea).\nInserting this decomposition into the quadratic string field theory action one\nobtains the following:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nXZ\n1 c,s 2 1 2\nc,s\n2\nST =\ndt\n\u1e6a (t) \u2212 (k~n \u2212 1)T~n (t)\n(10)\n2 ~n\n2\n~\nn\n\nThus we get a set of inverted harmonic oscillators (with k 2 < 1) and a set of\nnormal ones (modes with k 2 > 1). This is just the linearized approximation to a\ngenuine string field theoretical description but will be sufficient for our purpose.\nThe dominant unstable mode is the spatial constant mode, so we consider\nfirst that mode. We will return to the nonconstant modes later in the paper.\nThe (now) standard calculation of closed string emission assumes that we have\na classical tachyonic background Tcl (t), Tcl (t) being a solution to the classical\nequation originating from the truncated action (10). Such solutions are of the\nform\nTcl (t) = T0 cosh t or Tcl (t) = T0 et .\n(11)\nIn all calculations so far, whether one uses string field theory and the formalism of boundary states [4] or the conceptually simpler open string perturbative\napproach of [6], one always treats the tachyon profile as given by (11), i.e. as\nbeing strictly classical.\nAs mentioned above, one lesson from the 2d critical string theory was that\none has eventually to promote the classical tachyonic background to a quantum\nstate. One (first quantized) way to do that is to replace the classical solution\nwith a quantum wave function:\nTcl (t) \u2192 \u03c8(T, t),\n4\n\n(12)\n\n\fwhere the wave function \u03c8(T, t) is a solution to the corresponding quantum Hamiltonian coming from the action (10), i.e. in the case where we restrict ourselves to\nthe space-independent tachyon mode precisely (2). This should capture the most\nimportant quantum aspects of the D-brane as long as one does not consider the\nannihilation and creation of D-branes.\nOur aim now is to determine how an open string will propagate (and e.g.\neventually emit closed string radiation) in the fluctuating quantum background\ngiven by \u03c8(T, t).\nAn open string moving in the classical open string background Tcl (t) has a\nboundary action1\nR\nei B d\u03c4 Tcl (t(\u03c4 ))\n(13)\nLet us recast it in the following form:\ni\n\ne\n\nR tb\nta\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\ndt Tcl (t) \u1e6b1 +...+ \u1e6b1\n1\n\nn\n\n\u2261 ei\n\nR tb\nta\n\ndt Tcl (t)J(t)\n\n(14)\n\nwhere ti are the parameterizations of various sectors of the string boundary and\nta and tb are the minimum and maximum time coordinates of the boundary of the\nstring world-sheet and where we view J(t) as an external driving force for T (t).\nThe natural generalization from a classical Tcl (t) to a quantum state described\nby the wave function \u03c8(T, t) is\nE\nD R tb\nR tb\nei ta dt J(t)Tcl (t) \u2192 ei ta dt J(t)T (t) ,\n(15)\n\u03c8\n\ni.e. the expectation value of an (inverted) harmonic oscillator in the presence of an\nexternal source J(t). This expectation value can (in principle) be explicitly evaluated since we know the propagator KJ (Tb , tb ; Ta , ta ), of the (inverted) harmonic\noscillator in the presence of an external source J(t).

The expression (21) has a natural interpretation\nof (the exponential of) the quantum boundary action since it describes how the\nexponential of the classical action is changed if Tcl (t) \u2192 \u03c8(T, t).\n\nThe boundary action for gaussian wave functions\nIn order to exemplify the prescription let us consider a Gaussian wave packet\nwith the initial condition\n\u0010 a \u0011 14 a\n2\ne\u2212 2 (T \u2212T0 ) .\n(22)\n\u03c8(T, 0) =\n\u03c0\nAfter a rather long calculation one obtains\nE\nD R tb\nR\nR\ni\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ni ta dt J(t)T (t)\ne\n= eiT0 dt J(t) cosh t+ 2 dtdt J(t)Da (t,t )J(t )\n\u03c8\n\nor, using the definition of J(t):\nD R\nE\nR\nR R\ni\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\nei B d\u03c4 T (t(\u03c4 )) = ei B d\u03c4 T0 cosh t(\u03c4 )+ 2 B B d\u03c4 d\u03c4 Da (t(\u03c4 ),t (\u03c4 )) .\n\u03c8\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\nIn (23) and (24) we used the notation\nDa (t, t\u2032 ) = \u03b8(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n\n\u03c9 2 cosh \u03c9t cosh \u03c9t\u2032 + a2 sinh \u03c9t sinh \u03c9t\u2032\nsinh \u03c9(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n+i\n, (25)\n\u03c9\n2a\u03c9 2\n\nwhere we have kept \u03c9 (which should be put equal to one) in order to make clear\nhow this is related to the corresponding expression for the ordinary harmonic\noscillator by \u03c9 \u2192 i\u03c9. Note that the final results for the inverted and normal\n6\n\n\fharmonic oscillators are not related by an analytical continuation. This is due to\nthe wavefunctions appearing in (21). Eq. (25) simplifies if a = \u03c9: 2\nD\u03c9 (t, t\u2032 ) = \u03b8(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n\ncosh \u03c9(t + t\u2032 )\nsinh \u03c9(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n+i\n\u03c9\n2\u03c9\n\n(27)\n\nOne observes that indeed all explicit reference to ta and tb has dropped out\nand that the quantum boundary action corresponding to (23) or (24) has the\nstructure of the classical boundary action (the term linear in J(t)) and a quantum\ncorrection (the term quadratic in J(t)). We note the explicit appearance of the\nclassical boundary action, which is somewhat non-trivial since T0 only appears in\nthe position of the peak of the wave packet at t = 0. This can be understood as\nfollows: since the potential is quadratic we know that the expectation value hT (t)i\nwill precisely follow a classical trajectory, and in fact it is not difficult to show that\nthe classical trajectory associated with the wave packet \u03c8(T, 0) \u223c exp(\u2212a(T \u2212\nT0 )2 /2 is that of a particle put at T0 at time t = 0 with zero momentum. Thus our\nchoice of wave packet (22) is associated with the classical path T0 cosh \u03c9t. It is also\nworth to note that Gaussian wave packets at a specific time t remain Gaussian in\nT at any time since the propagator is Gaussian. However, the width can change\nin time and the Gaussian wave packet for the inverted harmonic oscillator spreads\nso fast that even if the peak follows a classical trajectory, coming in from T = \u221e\nand being reflected at position T0 at t = 0, finally to move back to T = \u221e, it has\nat any time a non-vanishing tail at the other side of the potential V (T ) = \u2212T 2 /2.\nFinally note that the quantum corrections have introduced an imaginary part\nin the quantum boundary action. From the point of view of quantum mechanics of\nthe (harmonic or) inverted harmonic oscillator it just reflects that the presence of a\nsource J(t) can change the wave function \u03c8(T, t) which is a solution corresponding\nto the Hamiltonian (2) without the presence of J(t). Eq. (23) gives the amplitude\nfor the system to remain in state |\u03c8i after being perturbed by the external source\nJ.\n\nConformal invariance\nIt is well known [8, 9, 10] that the classical rolling tachyon boundary interaction\nis conformally invariant (in the sense that it defines a BCFT and provides a consistent open string background). It is therefore interesting to ask what happens\nwhen the quantum-mechanical corrections are included.\n2\n\nFor the ordinary harmonic oscillator it comes a function of t \u2212 t\u2032 only:\nD\u03c9 (t, t\u2032 ) = \u03b8(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n\nsin \u03c9(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\ncos \u03c9(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n+i\n.\n\u03c9\n2\u03c9\n\n7\n\n(26)\n\n\fWe will now show that the boundary action (24) is conformally invariant\nat one loop. To this end we have to calculate the \u03b2 function for a boundary\ninteraction of the form:\nZ\nZ\nd\u03c4 T1 (t(\u03c4 )) + d\u03c4 d\u03c4 \u2032 T2 (t(\u03c4 ), t(\u03c4 \u2032 ))\n(28)\nAt one loop the first term gives the standard contribution T1 \u2212 d2 /dt2 T1 which\nobviously vanishes for the classical rolling tachyon profile. For the second term one\nperforms an analogous calculation by decomposing t(\u03c4 ) = t0 (\u03c4 )+\u03be(\u03c4 ), inserting it\ninto the action (28) and expanding up to quadratic order in \u03be(\u03c4 ). The background\nfield t0 (\u03c4 ) is chosen so that the linear terms will vanish. The contractions are\nthen made with\nh\u03be(\u03c4 )\u03be(\u03c4 \u2032 )i = 2 log |\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 |\n(29)\nregularized at coinciding points as 2 log \u039b. One then has to isolate terms proportional to log \u039b. One gets a straightforward generalization of the local terms:\nd2\nd2\n\u2032\n\u22122T2 (t, t ) + 2 T2 (t, t ) + \u2032 2 T2 (t, t\u2032 )\ndt\ndt\n\u2032\n\n(30)\n\nand the log \u039b piece of\n\nd d\nT (t, t\u2032 ) h\u03be(\u03c4 )\u03be(\u03c4 \u2032 )i\n(31)\n\u2032\ndt dt\nLet us first discuss the continous part of (25). Eq. (30) then vanishes trivially,\nwhile the integral of (31) will not give a divergence as the logarithmic singularity\nin (29) is integrable. Hence it will not generate a contribution to the \u03b2 function.\nThe discontinous part\n2\n\nsatisfies\n\nDadiscont. (t, t\u2032 ) = \u03b8(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) sinh(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\n\n(32)\n\n\u0013\nd2\n\u2212 1 Dadiscont. (t, t\u2032 ) = \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\ndt2\n\n(33)\n\n\u0012\n\nTherefore (30) gives 2\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ), while (31) gives\n2 {\u22122\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) cosh(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) \u2212 \u03b8(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) sinh(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) \u2212 \u03b4 \u2032 (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) sinh(t \u2212 t\u2032 )} h\u03be(\u03c4 )\u03be(\u03c4 \u2032 )i\n(34)\nOnly the first and last terms will contribute to the \u03b2 function and will give\n\u22122\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) which cancels the contribution of (30).\nFrom the above we see that the quantum corrections do not spoil conformal\ninvariance at one loop. It would be very interesting to verify if the result extends\nto higher orders in \u03b1\u2032 . In fact the properties of field theories with nonlocal\n(bilocal) boundary interactions seems to be largely unexplored (for a first study\n8\n\n\fsee [11]), yet such theories seem to appear here quite naturally. Moreover such\ntypes of boundary interactions can have quite nontrivial properties like mimicking\nclosed strings [12] etc. Care must also be taken, however, as there are examples\nof bilocal boundary interactions which are SL(2, C) invariant and yet break full\nVirasoro invariance [12].\n\nThe quantum decay rate\nThe starting point of the calculation of the decay of the D-brane is the disk\namplitude. As shown in [7] the amplitude to decay into closed strings tachyons\nis (in analogy with (4) and (5)) given by\nZ\nA(E) = dt eiEt \u03c1(t)\n(35)\nwhere \u03c1(t) is obtained as (\"tilde\" means no zero mode)\n\u03c1(t) = hei\n\nR\n\nB\n\nd\u03c4 T0 cosh(t+X\u03030 (\u03c4 ))\n\n(36)\n\nidisk\u2032\n\nThe corresponding expression for a quantum D-brane is now obtained from (24)\nby the replacement\neiT0\n\nR\n\nB\n\nd\u03c4 cosh(t+X\u03030 (\u03c4 ))\n\n\u2192 eiS\n\n(qba) (t+X\u0303\n\n0)\n\nwhere the quantum boundary action S (qba) (t + X\u03030 ) is\nZ Z\nZ\n1\nd\u03c41 d\u03c42 Da (t+ X\u03030 (\u03c41 ), t+ X\u03030(\u03c42 ))\nT0\nd\u03c4 cosh(t+ X\u03030 (\u03c4 )) +\n2 B B\nB\nWe thus have a modified \u03c1(t), much along the lines of the 2d case:\nZ\nR\nqba\n2\n\u03bc\niS qba (t+X\u03030 )\n\u03c1quan (t) = he\nidisk\u2032 = D X\u0303\u03bc eiS (t+X\u03030 ) ei disk d z \u2202 X\u0303\u03bc \u2202 X\u0303 ,\n\n(37)\n\n(38)\n\n(39)\n\nand a modified emission amplitude\nAquan (E) =\n\nZ\n\ndt eiEt \u03c1quan (t)\n\n(40)\n\nIn principle one can just apply the substitution (37) and perform the functional\naverage in the calculation of \u03c1quan (t). The simplest way to do this was outlined in\n[6] for the classical solution Tcl (t) = T0 et (the half-brane). However, the method\ncan also be used for Tcl (t) = T0 cosh t. Technically it is somewhat more complicated since one will encounter contraction of exponentials eX\u03030 (\u03c41 ) and e\u2212X\u03030 (\u03c42 ) ,\nand these result in singularities when points coincide on the boundary. However,\n9\n\n\fthe regularization proposed in [9] allows one to reproduce the result first derived\nby Sen [4]\n1\n1\n+\n\u2212 1.\n(41)\n\u03c1(t) =\nt\n1 + sin(\u03c0T0 ) e\n1 + sin(\u03c0T0 ) e\u2212t\nWe mention this because one encounters no further technical obstacles when using\nthe substitution (37) in the calculation (39).\nUnfortunately we have been unable to perform the calculation explicitly to a\n(qba)\nlevel that a formula like (41) appears , i.e. expand the exponential eiS (t+X\u03030 ) , do\nall the Wick contractions of the exponentials and sum the corresponding series.\nBut we note the following: the qualitative\nform of \u03c1(t) can be understood without\nR\ni B d\u03c4 cosh(t+X\u0303(\u03c4 ))\ncaused \u03c1(t) to vanish for\ncalculations: the fast oscillations of e\nt \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. The same is likely to be true for \u03c1quan (t) since in addition we have\nan exponentially decaying part in (37). However, the implications for the decay\namplitude Aquan (E) given by (40) is less clear since the integral for large E will\nbe dominated by the pole closest to the real axis. This is the reason it is not\nenough to perform an expansion of \u03c1quan (t) in powers of et to finite order (which\ncan indeed be done, as mentioned). One needs more precise information in order\nto determine the large E behavior of the Fourier transform Aquan (E).\nThus so far we cannot state that emission of large energy closed string states\nis damped by the quantum nature of the tachyon as was the case in 2d string\ntheory, although it is likely to be true. In any case it would be very interesting\nto perform such a calculation.\n\nInclusion of momentum modes\nSo far we have restricted ourselves to tachyons with no momentum dependence\n(the tachyon zero-mode). Let us now examine how the quantum treatment of the\nmomentum modes influences the picture.\nAs we have already seen in formula (10), we obtain a set of inverted harmonic\noscillators (with k 2 < 1) and a set of normal ones (modes with k 2 > 1). A natural\nwave function to consider is a Gaussian wave packet (with a = |\u03c9|) for each of\nthe modes. For simplicity we set the initial 'position' T0 to zero. This kind of\nwave function illustrates the weirdness of dealing with tachyons: the higher and\nlower modes behave completely differently - the higher modes are just in their\nstationary vacuum state while the lower ones spread out due to the inverted\nharmonic potential.\nThe boundary action for an open string is given by (8) so we have to calculate\nY \u001c R d\u03c4 1 p \u03c6~cn (t)*cos kx \u001d \u001c R d\u03c4 1 p \u03c6~sn (t)*sin kx \u001d\nquantum\nSb\n=\ne (2\u03c0L) 2\n* e (2\u03c0L) 2\n(42)\n\u03c8\n\n~\nn\n\n10\n\n\u03c8\n\n\fThe result follows from (26) and (27). For the higher, normal (cosine) modes one\nobtains\nh\n\u2032\n\u2032 i\nR\ni\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032 sin \u03c9(t\u2212t ) + i cos \u03c9(t\u2212t )\nd\u03c4 d\u03c4 \u2032 (2\u03c0L)\np cos kx cos kx \u03b8(t\u2212t )\n2\n\u03c9\n2\n\u03c9\ne\n(43)\n\u221a\nwhere \u03c9 = k 2 \u2212 1. The result for the sine modes is similar. Note that (43)\ncontains no dependence on the time t which enters into the calculation of \u03c1quan (t)\nin accordance with the fact that we are just using the standard vacuum wave\nfunctions for the higher modes.\nFor the lower, tachyonic modes we obtain from (27):\ne\n\ni\n2\n\nR\n\nh\n\u2032\n\u2032 i\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032 sinh \u03ba(t\u2212t ) + i cosh \u03ba(t+t )\nd\u03c4 d\u03c4 \u2032 (2\u03c0L)\np cos kx cos kx \u03b8(t\u2212t )\n\u03ba\n2\n\u03ba\n\n(44)\n\n\u221a\nwith \u03ba = 1 \u2212 k 2 .\nNow we have to perform a summation over k in the exponential. The volume\nfactor and summation transforms into an integral, while the \u03c9 in the denominator\ngives the standard Lorentz-invariant phase space measure. The dominant behavior for large t, t\u2032 comes from second piece in the formula for the lower, tachyonic\nmodes. We thus have to evaluate:\nZ\n\u221a\ndp k\n1\n\u221a\n(45)\n\u2212\ncos(~k * (~x \u2212 x~\u2032 )) cosh( 1 \u2212 k 2 (t + t\u2032 ))\n4 k2 <1 1 \u2212 k 2\nThis integral can be performed analytically in the small |x \u2212 x\u2032 | region and we\nobtain\nI p\u22121 (t + t\u2032 )\n(46)\nconst * 2\nD\u22122\n(t + t\u2032 ) 2\nFor large t, t\u2032 this behaves exponentially like the zero mode (in fact it is the\ndominant zero mode which gives this contribution) \u2013 so the qualitative features of\nthe result, like the exponential suppression of the partition function/amplitudes\nat large times, is similar as in the zero-mode case and we do not expect any\nadditional surprises coming from the space-dependent tachyonic modes.\n\nDiscussion\nAs mentioned in the introduction the considerations in this paper were motivated\non the one hand by the desire to understand more about the nature of quantum\nD-branes, and on the other hand by the very explicit quantum effects which could\nbe analyzed quantitatively for D0-branes in 2d string theory [5]. Some generic\naspects have emerged from this investigation.\nThe first is that the quantum nature Tcl (t) \u2192 \u03c8(T, t) makes it impossible to\nignore the \"other side\" of the potential V (T ) = \u2212T 2 /2. As discussed above the\nwave packets always have a tail on the other side of the potential. This is bad\n11\n\n\fsince the \"other side\" of the full tachyonic potential in bosonic string theory is\nunbounded from below like T 3 . This is much worse than \u2212T 2 . There is no natural\nself-adjoint Hamiltonian in such a potential and most likely there is no cure for\nsuch a theory. It makes the role of the conjectured minimum on the \"right side\"\nof the potential somewhat dubious. Of course one can alway confine oneself to\nthe study of superstrings where the potential is bounded from below.\nSecondly, the quantum correction to the boundary action seems to preserve\nconformal invariance at least to one loop order. It would be very interesting to\nstudy these issues in more detail.\nThirdly, there will generically be an imaginary part in the quantum boundary action. For the simplest constant mode wave function (22) with a = 1 in\nMinkowski space one has a term\n1\n\ne\u2212 4\n\nR\n\nd\u03c4\n\nR\n\nd\u03c4 \u2032 cosh(2t+X0\u2032 (\u03c4 )+X0\u2032 (\u03c4 \u2032 ))\n\n,\n\n(47)\n\nThis very strong suppression of \"propagation\" for large times seems to be a genuine quantum effect related to the state \u03c8(T, t) and such behavior is characteristic\nfor potentials unbounded from below like the inverse harmonic potential.\nThe appearance of this term has an interesting consequence with regards to\nthe conjecture that in the tachyon vacuum open strings disappear and only closed\nstrings are left. The amplitude for an open string propagating to very large times\nwill always be exponentially supressed with respect to the amplitude of an open\nstring transforming into a closed string at some finite time, even though the latter\namplitude would be penalized by a factor of gs .\nFinally let us note that it would also be very interesting to explore the role\nof quantum backgrounds for closed strings, not necessarily just in the context of\ntachyonic physics.\n\nAcknowledgment\nJ.A. and R.J. acknowledge support by the EU network on \"Discrete Random\nGeometry\", grant HPRN-CT-1999-00161. and by \"MaPhySto\", the Center of\nMathematical Physics and Stochastics, financed by the National Danish Research\nFoundation.
