We extend\nthis further to rotating black holes in all spacetime dimensions and show that although as in four\ndimensions the spectrum is discrete, it is not equispaced in general. As a result, Hawking radiation\nspectra from these black holes are continuous, as opposed to the discrete spectrum predicted for\nfour dimensional black holes.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSeveral different approaches have shown by now that the quantum mechanical spectra of black hole observables\n(such as area, charge and angular momentum) are discrete [1\u20133]. Among them, the reduced phase space quantisation\ntechnique of Barvinsky et al [2] confirms an earlier conjecture by Bekenstein and collaborators that the area spectrum\nof quantum black holes is indeed discrete as well as equispaced [4]. The last property makes a rather interesting\nprediction that Hawking radiation from black holes will have a noticeably discrete spectrum, which can have interesting\nexperimental consequences [5]. The results were extended to the case of charged black holes, which yielded a separate\ndiscrete spectrum for the electric charge. The area spectrum was slightly more complicated in this case, although the\nuniform spacing property remained intact. These spectra were re-derived from algebraic approaches in [6, 7].\nRecently the above formalism was extended by Gour and Medved to rotating (uncharged) black holes in four\nspacetime dimensions [8] (and to rotating charged black holes in [9]). They showed that the corresponding area\nspectrum is also discrete and equispaced: A = 8\u03c0 (n + m + 1/2) where n and m are non-negative integers. While n\nsignifies the departure of the black hole from extremality, m measures the classical angular momentum of the black\nhole. In this paper, we extend their formalism to include 3-dimensional BT Z black holes as well as 5 and higher\ndimensional Myers-Perry type rotating black holes with multiple angular momenta parameters. We show that while\nthe area spectrum is discrete in each case, in general it is not equispaced. In particular, the 3 and 5 dimensional black\nholes have a non-uniform area spectrum. We also show that this makes Hawking radiation from these black holes\ncontinuous, as opposed to the discrete radiation spectrum characteristic of black holes of uniformly spaced area.\nThis paper is organised as follows. In the next section, we review some thermodynamic properties of the BT Z black\nhole and derive the quantum mechanical spectra of its area and angular momentum. In section (III), we consider\nthe 5-dimensional rotating black hole with 2 angular momentum parameters and derive the corresponding spectra.\nThen in section (IV), we derive the area spectrum for six and higher dimensional black holes, whose area spectum is\nshown to be quite distinct from black holes in lower dimensions. In section (V), we study the implications of the area\nspectrum that we found for Hawking radiation, and show that in most cases the radiation spectrum is a continuum,\nunlike that for four dimensional black holes. We conclude with a summary, some open questions as well as some\nobservations regarding adiabaticc invariants in quantum gravity in section (VI).\nII.\n\nBTZ BLACK HOLES\n\nFirst, let us consider a BTZ black hole, which is a solution of three dimensional Einstein equations with a negative\ncosmological constant \u039b \u2261 \u22121/l2.

In the extremal limit r+ = r\u2212 one has:\nr\nr\nr\nr\nM\nJ\n2J\n2J\nM l = J , (r+ )extr = l\n=\n, Aextr = \u03c0\n, Sextr = 2\u03c0\n,\n(7)\n2\n2l\nl\nl\nwhere we have assumed J \u2265 0 without loss of generality.\nTo derive quantum mechanical spectra, we start with the complete set of commuting observables (M, J) and their\nconjugates (\u03a0M , \u03a0J ). Since \u03a0M has the interpretation of difference between Schwarzschild times across a spacelike\nslice extending from the left to the right wedge of a Kruskal diagram, following [2, 8], we impose the periodicity\ncondition:\n\u03a0M \u223c \u03a0M +\n\n2\u03c0\n,\n\u03ba\n\n(8)\n\nto incorporate the thermodynamic nature of the system under consideration. Next, we make the following transformation to a new set of phase space variables (X, PX ) which automatically incorporate the above periodicity:\nr\nB(M, J)\ncos (\u03a0M \u03ba)\n(9)\nX =\n\u03c0\nr\nB(M, J)\nPX =\nsin (\u03a0M \u03ba) ,\n(10)\n\u03c0\nwhere B(M, J) is an hitherto unknown function. Computation of Poisson bracket yields:\n{X, PX } =\n\n\u03ba \u2202B\n2\u03c0 \u2202M\n\n(11)\n\nFrom (6) it follows that if the function B(M, J) is chosen such that:\nB(M, J) = S(M, J) + F (J) = 2A(M, J) + F (J) ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere F (J) is arbitrary, then the above Poisson bracket becomes unity and the transformation (M, \u03a0M ) \u2192 (X, \u03a0X )\nis indeed canonical. With this choice, squaring and adding (9) and (10), we get:\n2\nX 2 + PX\n=\n\n2A(M, J) + F (J)\n.\n\u03c0\n\n(13)\n\nNoting that for a given J, since the horizon area A cannot be less than Aextr given in (7), it follows that \u2200 J \u2265 0, the\n(X,pPX ) phase space has a 'hole' centred at the origin and with radius Min (2A(M, J) + F (J)) = 2Aextr (J) + F (J) =\n2\u03c0 2J/2l + F (J) removed from it. Although this gives rise to quantisation ambiguities, these can be eliminated by\nthe following unique choice of F :\nr\n2J\nF (J) = \u22122\u03c0\n,\n(14)\nl\n\n\f3\nsuch that:\nB(M, J) = 2A(M, J) \u2212 2\u03c0\n\nr\n\n2J\nl\n\n(15)\n\n2J\n.\nl\n\n(16)\n\nand\n2\n\nX +\n\n2\nPX\n\n2A(M, J)\n=\n\u22122\n\u03c0\n\nr\n\nQuantisation is now straightforward with the replacements: X \u2192 X\u0302 and PX \u2192 P\u0302X = \u2212i\u2202/\u2202X. The LHS of (16) is\nrecognisable as the Hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator of mass= 1/2 and angular frequency = 2. This results in the\nfollowing spectra for entropy and horizon area:\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n2J\n.\n(17)\n=\u03c0 n+\nA\u2212\u03c0\nl\n2\nNext, the quantisation of angular momentum follows from the usual identification in 3-dimensions: J\u02c6 = \u2212i\u2202/\u2202\u03c6,\nresulting in eigenfunctions: \u03c8m = exp(im\u03c6) with eigenvalues m = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Thus the final spectrum of area is:\n!\nr\n2m 1\n, n, m = 0, 1, 2, . . .\n(18)\n+\nA=\u03c0 n+\nl\n2\nwhere it is understood that the area above (and in subsequent sections) is measured in Planck units. Note that it is\ndiscrete, but not equispaced. It will be shown in section (V) that this will have important consequences for Hawking\nradiation. Also note that m = 0 (no rotation) reduces the above spectrum to the equispaced spectrum conjectured\nin [4]. However, unlike the non-rotating case, or those that result from the recent identification of black hole quasinormal modes with Hawking radiation frequencies (see e.g. [3, 11]), Eq.(18) does not have the multiplicative factor\nof ln(2) or ln(3) in front. Moreover, our 'ground-state area' is non-vanishing, suggesting that the the end stage of\nHawking radiation is a Planck sized remnant. The above two features are generic for black holes in arbitrary spacetime\ndimensions, as will be seen in subsequent sections.\nIII.\n\nFIVE-DIMENSIONAL ROTATING BLACK HOLES\n\nWe now extend our results to five-dimensional rotating black holes. As suggested from the approaches in [2, 8]\nand in the previous section, the first step towards quantizing black hole horizon area is to find a set of mutually\ncommutating operators and their conjugates. A naive extension of the analysis in the preceeding section fails for\nd \u2265 4, since the different components of angular momenta fail to commute. However, as shown in [8] this problem\ncan be readily cured by replacing the usual angular momentum components by the Euler components of angular\nmomentum, which mutually commute [12]. Here we extend that analysis to d = 5 black holes which has two rotation\nparameters [13]. The key observation that makes this possible is that the relevant rotation group SO(4) is isomorphic\nto SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2).

Thus, one can\nchoose as canonical variables the following set: (M, J1Cl , J\u03b11 , J\u03b31 , J2Cl , J\u03b12 , J\u03b32 ) with the corresponding conjugates\n(\u03a0M , \u03a0J1 , \u03a0\u03b11 , \u03a0\u03b31 , \u03a0J2 , \u03a0\u03b12 , \u03a0\u03b32 ) respectively. As before, we impose the periodicity (8), which is now incorporated\nby the following transformation:\nr\nB(M, J1Cl , J\u03b11 , J\u03b31 , J2Cl , J\u03b12 , J\u03b32 )\nX=\ncos(\u03a0M \u03ba) ,\n(54)\n\u03c0\nr\nB(M, J1Cl , J\u03b11 , J\u03b31 , J2Cl , J\u03b12 , J\u03b32 )\nPX =\nsin(\u03a0M \u03ba) .\n(55)\n\u03c0\n\nComputation of Poisson brackets yields once again:\n{X, PX } =\n\n\u03ba \u2202B\n,\n2\u03c0 \u2202M\n\n(56)\n\nwhich now implies:\nB=\n\n1\n[A(M, J1Cl , J2Cl ) \u2212 Aext (J1Cl , J2Cl )] ,\n4\n\n(57)\n\nwhere we have set G5 = 1. Squaring and adding (54) and (55):\n2\nX 2 + PX\n=\n\n1\n[A(M, J1Cl , J2Cl ) \u2212 Aext (J1Cl , J2Cl )] \u2265 0 .\n4\u03c0\n\n(58)\n\nQuantising as before, we now get:\nA \u2212 Aext\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n, n = 0, 1, 2, * * *\n= 8\u03c0 n +\n2\n\n(59)\n\n\f6\nIt may be noted that the above equation has the same form as the corresponding equation in the d = 4 case\n(Eq.(43) of [8]). The distinction between that case and the current one lies in the difference in the functional form of\nextremal entropy and the resulting difference that arises on quantisation. Now, since (25)-(30) remains valid when the\nclassical quantities are replaced by their corresponding operator counterparts [8, 12], together with the replacement:\n\u2202\nJ\u02c6ai \u2192 \u2212i \u2202a\n, a = \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, one obtains the following relations for i = 1, 2:\ni\n1\n[J\u02c6\u03b12i + J\u02c6\u03b32i \u2212 2 cos \u03b2i J\u02c6\u03b1i J\u02c6\u03b3i ] + J\u02c6\u03b22i ,\nsin2 \u03b2i\n2\n2\n2\nJ\u02c6i2 = J\u02c6i1\n+ J\u02c6i2\n+ J\u02c6i3\n.\n\u2202\n2\n.\nand J\u02c6iCl\n\u2212 J\u02c6i2 = cot \u03b2i\n\u2202\u03b2i\n2\nJ\u02c6iCl\n=\n\n(60)\n(61)\n(62)\n\nSince all the operators in the set {J\u02c61 , J\u02c62 , J\u02c61Cl and J\u02c62Cl } commute with J\u02c6\u03b1i and J\u02c6\u03b3i (i = 1, 2), both sets of eigenvectors\n{|j1 , j2 , J\u03b11 , J\u03b12 , J\u03b31 , J\u03b32 i} and {|J1Cl , J2Cl , J\u03b11 , J\u03b12 , J\u03b31 , J\u03b32 i} are complete and an element of one can be expressed\nas a superposition of the elements of the other:\nX\n(63)\nCj1 ,j2 ,J1Cl ,J2Cl (j1 , j2 , J1Cl , J2Cl ) |j1 , j2 , J\u03b11 , J\u03b12 , J\u03b31 , J\u03b32 i ,\n|J1Cl , J2Cl , J\u03b11 , J\u03b12 , J\u03b31 , J\u03b32 i =\nj1 ,j2\n\nTo compute the eigenvalues of JiCl , consider the eigenfunction with zero eigenvalues for \u03b1i and \u03b3i : \u03a8J1Cl ,0,0,0,0,0 =\nh\u03b11 , \u03b21 , \u03b31 , \u03b12 , \u03b22 , \u03b32 |J1Cl , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0i. Then, from (60):\n\u22022\n2\nJ\u02c6iCl\n\u03a8JiCl ,0,0,0,0,0 = J\u02c6\u03b22i \u03a8JiCl ,0,0,0,0,0 = \u2212 2 \u03a8JiCl ,0,0,0,0,0 \u2261 m2i \u03a8JiCl ,0,0,0,0,0 .\n\u2202\u03b21\n\n(64)\n\nWith the usual identification for Euler angles, \u03b2i + \u03c0 = \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b2i , we get:\n\u03a8JiCl ,0,0,0,0,0 \u223c cos (mi \u03b2i ) , mi = 0, 1, 2. * * *\n\u223c sin (mi \u03b2i ) , mi = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, * * *\nwith JiCl = mi .\n\n(65)\n(66)\n\nThe additional fact that \u03a8ji ,0,0,0,0 is a symmetric function of \u03b2 together with equation (63) rules out the half-odd\nintegral quantisation of JiCl . Thus we are left with Eq(65) as the correct quantisation condition. This implies, from\n(33) and (34) that:\n1\n(m1 + m2 )\n2\n1\n(m1 \u2212 m2 ) , mi = 0, 1, 2. * * *\n=\n2\n\nJ\u03c6 =\n\n(67)\n\nJ\u03c8\n\n(68)\n\nUsing (53), the final result of the area spectrum is\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq\n1\n1\n|m21 \u2212 m22 | +\nA = 8\u03c0 n +\n, n, m1 , m2 = 0, 1, 2, * * *\n2\n2\n\n(69)\n\nThus we see that the five-dimensional Kerr black hole area spectrum is also quantized but not equally spaced.\nEquispaced spectrum can arise as a special case however, either when m1 = 0 (or m2 = 0) or when m1 = m2 . The\nlatter case implies J\u03c8 = 0, corresponding to a single parameter five dimensional black hole. We will examine in section\n(V) the effects of quantized area spectrum on Hawking radiation.\nIV.\n\nSIX AND HIGHER DIMENSIONAL ROTATING BLACK HOLES\n\nThe situation simplifies drastically for six and higher dimensions because of the absence of an extremality bound.\nThe number of angular momentum parameters ai 's for the d-dimensional Kerr black hole will be [(d \u2212 1)/2](square\nbracket denotes integer part). For simplicity, we consider the metric component of a single angular momentum\nparameter Kerr black hole- that is, a1 \u2261 a \u2261 2J/M where M = \u03bc(d \u2212 2)(2\u03c0)(d\u22121)/2 /{\u0393[(d \u2212 1)/2]16\u03c0G} and ai = 0\nfor 2 \u2264 i \u2264 [(d \u2212 1)/2] [13]:\n\u0001\nrd\u22125 r2 + a2 \u2212 \u03bc\nrr\n.\n(70)\ng = d\u22125 2\nr\n(r + a2 cos2 \u03b8)\n\n\f7\n\n4\n\n3\n\nHor\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nmu\n\nFIG. 1: Plot of r+ vs \u03bc for d = 6, 7, . . . , 10 for a = 1. The highest graph corresponds to d = 6 and the lowest to d = 10.\n\nIt follows that for d \u2265 6, the horizon condition g rr = 0 is satisfied for some 0 \u2264 r \u2264 \u221e for any given value of a and M .\nIn other words, the black hole angular momentum is in no way contrained by its mass and in fact can be arbitrarily\nlarge. Moreover, for a fixed a, for \u03bc \u226a a, we see that the horizon radius shrinks to zero. This can also be seen from\nFig.1, where the outer horizon radius has been plotted against the black hole mass for 6 \u2264 d \u2264 10 Thus, there is no\n'minimum' horizon area for a fixed a, and the function F (J) can be chosen to vanish. Consequently, the equivalents\nof (54)-(55) read as:\nr\nA(M, J)\nX=\ncos(\u03a0M \u03ba) ,\n(71)\n4\u03c0\nr\nA(M, J)\nPX =\nsin(\u03a0M \u03ba) .\n(72)\n4\u03c0\nwhere\n\u2202\u03a0/\u2202r \u2212 2\u03bcr\n|r+ , d = odd\n2\u03bcr2\n\u2202\u03a0/\u2202r \u2212 \u03bc\n=\nd = even\n|r + ,\n2\u03bcr\n\n\u03ba =\n\n(73)\n(74)\n\n\u0001\nQ[ d\u22121 ]\nand \u03a0 = i=12 r2 + a2i . Once again (71)-(72) incorporate the natural periodicity condition (8) and the transformations are canonical. Squaring and adding:\n\u0001\n2\n.\n(75)\nA = 4\u03c0 X 2 + PX\nQuantisation yields:\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nAn = 8\u03c0 n +\n, n = 0, 1, 2, * * * .\n2\n\n(76)\n\nRemarkably, angular momentum plays no role in area spectrum in d \u2265 6, and the above spectrum is identical to the\nneutral black hole spectrum found in [2]. The Hawking radiation spectrum is not the same however, as will be shown\nin the next section. It would be interesting to investigate other physical significances that this equispaced spectrum\nmight have.\nV.\n\nHAWKING RADIATION FROM ROTATING BLACK HOLES\n\nAn important consequence of a strictly equispaced area spectrum is a markedly discrete spectrum for Hawking\n2\nradiation [2, 4, 5]. Consider for example the area spectrum of a d = 4 Schwarzschild black hole. Using A = 4\u03c0r+\n=\n\n\f8\n16\u03c0M 2 , the lowest Hawking radiation frequency \u03c90 emitted due to a transition of this black hole from an excited\nstate to its next lower state (\u03b4n = \u22121, |\u03b4A| = 8\u03c0 from (76) ) is given by:\n1\n|\u03b4A|\n=\n= 2\u03c0TH\n(77)\n32\u03c0M\n4M\nand all higher frequencies will be multiples of the above. Comparing with Wien's law for frequency of maximum\nintensity of blackbody radiation:\n\u03c90 = |\u03b4M | =\n\n\u03c9max \u2248 TH ,\n\n(78)\n\nwe see that the \u03c90 \u2248 \u03c9max . Thus there will be only a few visible spectrum lines in Hawking radiation even for\na macroscopic black hole, leading to the aforementioned conclusion. The qualitative picture remains unchanged for\nReissner-Nordstr\u00f6m black holes as well [2]. Next we examine the impications for rotating black holes.\nA.\n\nBTZ black hole\n\nIn this case, it follows from (18) that for an emitted quantum of Hawking radiation:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b4m\n\u03b4SBH = 2\u03b4A = 2\u03c0 \u03b4n + \u221a\n.\n2lm\nReplacing dM \u2192 \u03c90 and plugging in the expression for \u03a9 from (5) in the first law (6), we get:\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef 2\u03c0TH\n+\n\u03c90 = 2\u03c0TH \u03b4n + \uf8f0 \u221a\n2lm\n\nm\n\uf8fa\nq\n\u00112 \uf8fb \u03b4m\n\u0010\n2 n + 2m\nl + 1/2\n\n(79)\n\n(80)\n\nNext, consider an emission line for which \u03b4n = 0 and |\u03b4m| = 1, and the black hole to be 'macroscopic', for which\nn \u2265 m \u226b 1. Then:\n2\u03c0TH\n\u03c90 = \u221a\n+\n2lm\n\nm\nq\n\u0010\n\u00112 \u2192 0\n2 n + 2m\n+\n1/2\nl\n\n(81)\n\nimplying that the radiation spectrum is quasi-continuum, quite different from the d = 4 case and exactly as predicted\nby the original Hawking analysis. We will return to the case \u03b4n 6= 0 for this and other black holes in the concluding\nsection.\nB.\n\nFour dimensional Kerr black hole\n\nHere we use the spectrum found in [8], namely:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n, n, m = 0, 1, 2, * * * ,\nA = 8\u03c0 n + m +\n2\nJCl = m\n\n(82)\n(83)\n\nimplying\n\u03b4A = 8\u03c0 (\u03b4n + \u03b4m) , \u03b4n, \u03b4m = 0, 1, 2, * * * .\n\n2\nOnce again, using (82)-(83), the first law and \u03a9 = a/(r+\n+ a2 ), we now get:\n\"\nm\n\u0001\n\u03c90 = 2\u03c0TH \u03b4n + 2\u03c0TH + M\n1\n2 n+m+ 2 +\n\nm2\nM\n\n(84)\n\n#\n\n\u03b4m\n\n(85)\n\nIn this case, for |\u03b4m| = 1 (and for any finite \u03b4n), we see that:\n\n\u03c90 \u2248 2\u03c0TH\n\n(86)\n\nand the Hawking radiation spectrum is once again discrete and identical to the Schwarzschild (and ReissnerNordstr\u00f6m) black hole spectrum (77).\n\n\f9\nC.\n\nFive dimensional rotating black hole\n\nFrom the five dimensional area spectrum (69), the first law and the expression for the angular momenta (44-45),\nwe get:\n!\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(m1 + m2 )d(m1 + m2 )\n3\nm1 |\u03b4m1 | \u2212 m2 |\u03b4m2 |\np\n(87)\n+\n\u03c90 = 2\u03c0TH |\u03b4n| +\n2 + 9(m + m )2 /16M 2 + (m2 \u2192 \u2212m2 )\n8M r+\n1\n2\n2 m21 \u2212 m22\n\nwhere we have assumed without loss of generality that m1 \u2265 m2 . As for BTZ, consider an emission characterised by:\n\u03b4n = 0 (signifying A \u2212 Aext remaining unchanged) and concentrate on the second term within the parenthesis, since\nthe last term is in any case negligible for very large M . We see that for any given \u01eb \u226a 1 , if\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\ns\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u00132\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm2 \uf8f0\n2\u01eb\nm1\nm2\n\uf8fb\n\u03b4m1 =\n\u03b4m2 ,\n(88)\n\u2212 1 \u03b4m2 \u2248\n1+\nm1\n\u03b4m2\nm2\nm1\nthen\n\n\u03c90 = 2\u03c0\u01eb TH \u2192 0\n\n(89)\n\nNotice however that both |\u03b4m1,2 | \u2265 1. This implies, along with (88) and |\u03b4m2 | \u2264 m2 , that m2 \u2264 m1 \u2264 m22 . That\nis, unless the two angular momentum parameters are hugely disproportionate, such that the second inequality in the\nabove is violated (or when m1 = 0 or m2 = 0), the radiation spectrum is a quasi-continuum, as was the case in three\ndimensions. Since these black holes are natural candidates in certain brane world scenarios, it is possible that the\nabove observations will have experimental signatures from the four dimensional (brane) point of view.\nD.\n\nSix and higher dimensional rotating black hole\n\nFrom (76) and the first law, we get:\n\u03c90 = 2\u03c0TH \u03b4n +\n\n2\nr+\n\na\n\u03b4m .\n+ a2\n\n(90)\n\nNote that, as for d = 4 Schwarzschild black holes, the first term implies a discrete spectrum. But unlike that case,\nhere an additional parameter \u03b4m (\u03b4mi , i = 1, 2, [d \u2212 1]/2 in general) enters the problem. Recalling that there is no\nextremality bound for d \u2265 6, if the black hole is such that a \u226b r+ and the black hole to be macroscopic, then for\n\u03b4n = 0, |\u03b4m| = 1, we have:\n\u03c90 =\n\n1\n\u2192 0.\na\n\n(91)\n\nIt is easy to see that similar conclusions will follow for a \u226a r+ as well as a \u2248 r+ . Thus we see that the single\nangular momentum Kerr black holes in d \u2265 6 shows continuous Hawking spectrum in spite of the area spectrum\nbeing equispaced. It remains to be checked whether this property holds even if we include more angular momentum\nparameters.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have extended an earlier formalism by Barvinsky et al, adapted to Kerr black holes by Gour\nand Medved to include rotating black holes in all spacetime dimensions. This was done in three steps. First, the\nmethod was applied to 3-dimensional BT Z black holes with one angular momentum parameter, where the observables\nA and J were mutually commuting. Second, it was applied to 5-dimensional rotating black holes with two angular\nmomentum parameters. Using the fact that the corresponding rotation group SO(4) \u223c\n= SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2), and using the\ntechnique of [8] in which the Cartesian components of angular momentum are replaced by the mutually commuting\nEuler components, we were able to quantise the the two angular momentum components and arrive at the spectrum\nof horizon area of these black holes. Finally six and higher dimensional black holes were studied with one angular\nmomentum parameter, since this was sufficient to demonstrate its essential difference with lower dimensional black\nholes,\n\n\f10\nThe horizon area spectra for the above black holes were found to be quite different from that in d = 4. In\nparticular, we found that both for d = 3 and 5 the spectrum is no longer equispaced (except for the special case\nwhen the two angular momentum parameters were equal in d = 5). A direct consequence was that Hawking radiation\nspectrum from these black holes are practically continuous (for large black holes), as opposed to the distinctly discrete\nspectrum predicted for d = 4 black holes which can carry angular momentum or charge. The situation was even more\ninteresting for d = 6, in which case although the spectrum turned out to be equispaced, the Hawking radiation\nretained its continuous nature. Although it may seem that there is an additional discrete spectrum for all the cases\nconsidered when \u03b4n \u2248 1, this does not affect our conclusions in any way, since the superposition of a discrete and a\ncontinuous spectrum is a continuum, the greybody factors being the same for each case. Such closeness of radiation\nspectra from higher dimensional black holes with the semi-classical Hawking analysis may lead one to speculate that\nbrane world black holes are more fundamental, since Hawking's result is expected to be valid for macroscopic black\nholes. In fact one of the proposed brane world scenarios requires the spacetime dimension of our universe to be at\nleast six [15], for which we have seen that interesting conclusions follow for rotating black holes. However, further\ninvestigations are required before arriving at a definitive conclusion. In any case, phenomenological implications of\nour higher dimensional results seem worth investigating.\nWe conclude with an observation related to adiabatic invariants in quantum gravity. Motivated by some thought\nexperiments, it was conjectured by Bekenstein that black hole horizon area is an adiabatic invariant in quantum\ngravity, i.e. it remains unaffected by small changes in black hole parameters. In [2] an explicit proof of this conjecture\nwas presented for spherically symmetric uncharged black holes, while in the presence of a charge Q it was shown that\nA \u2212 Aextr (Q) was an adiabatic invariant. We show here that a similar result follows. For periodic systems, it is well\nknown that the quantity:\nI\nI \u2261 PX dX\n(92)\nis an adiabatic invariant, where (X, \u03a0X ) are usual phase-space coordinates [16]. It follws that for harmonic oscillator\nlike Hamiltonians as in (16), (58) and (75), the corresponding adiabatic invariants are:\nA \u2212 Aextr (J)\n(BT Z)\n\u03c0\nA \u2212 Aextr (J1Cl , J2Cl )\n(d = 5)\n=\n8\u03c0\nA\n(d \u2265 6) .\n=\n8\u03c0\n\nI =\n\nNote once again that as for charged black holes, upto d = 5, the 'excess-area' above extremality is an adiabatic\ninvariant, while for d \u2265 6, the horizon area itself is the invariant, as conjectured by Bekenstein. It will be interesting\nto study the most general case of charged and rotating black holes to see what the adiabatic invariants are for such a\nsystem.\nAcknowledgements:\nWe thank G.
