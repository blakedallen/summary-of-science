With the aid of the laser radiation one can manipulate the centerof-mass motion of ultracold atoms and one can observe different wave phenomena with ultracold\natomic beams. After the experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensation, which allows\nto create rather dense atomic systems, the problem of interaction of photons with ultracold\natoms has reached a new stage of development. Acting with the laser on a dense atomic sample\none can induce nonlinearities in the behavior of the matter field caused by dynamical dipoledipole interactions. This provides a possibility to create atomic solitons of different kinds [1],\nto change dramatically the effective scattering length of the condensate [2], to create nonlinear\nbeam splitters [3], vortices [4], photonic band gaps and defet states in a condensate [5].\nIn recent years different approaches to the description of interaction of ultracold atoms in\nthe field of optical radiation have been suggested and different aspects of the phenomenon\nhave been considered. The properties of the laser radiation modified by atomic dipole-dipole\ninteractions were investigated [6, 7, 8] and it was shown that they can be described by the\nrefractive index which is governed in the linear case, when the light intensity is low enough, by\nthe Clausius-Mossotti relation known from classical optics if we neglect quantum correlations.\nIf the quantum statistical correlations are taken into account, the formula for the refractive\nindex contains additional terms defined by a position dependent correlation function [6, 7, 8].\nNonlinear optical properties of noninteracting Bose gas were studied as well [9].\nThe modification of the properties of the laser radiation should have a back influence on the\nbehavior of an ultracold atomic ensemble (for example, the motion of atomic beam). An attempt\nto consider this back influence was undertaken by several authors [1, 3, 7, 10, 11, 12]. In the first\nworks on the subject the two-body interactions were modelled by the phenomenological contact\npotential [10]. Later on dynamical dipole-dipole interactions were taken into account within\nthe framework of the nonrelativistic electrodynamics [1, 3, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. However, in\npapers by W.Zhang and D.Walls [3] and G.Lenz et al.[1] the averaged polarization of ultracold\natomic ensemble was computed as a function of the incident laser field, whereas it should be a\nfunction of the macroscopic or the local field which are different from the external laser field\ndue to dynamical dipole-dipole interactions. Wallis [12] used the correct form of the equations\nfor the electromagnetic field. However, his equation for the matter field was not consistent with\nthe equation for the electromagnetic field [13]. This problem was considered also by Y.Castin\nand K.M\u00f8lmer [11] and J.Ruostekoski and J.Javanainen [7]. But the equations which are used\nin those papers are very complicated because they are written down in terms of the local field\n2\n\n\fand dipole-dipole interactions are presented explicitly in the form of the sum over dipole fields.\nThis makes the analysis very difficult and the equations, which govern the time evolution of\nthe matter fields, remained unsolved.\nIn the papers [13, 14, 15] a self-consistent quantum theory of atom optical processes has been\ndeveloped. Making use of the Lorentz-Lorenz relation, which allows to simplify the analysis,\nit was obtained the general system of Maxwell-Schr\u00f6dinger equations for atomic creation and\nannihilation operators and the propagation equation for the laser field which can be used for\nthe description of linear and nonlinear phenomena in atom optics of single- and multi-species\ncondensates at high densities of the atomic system. However, the treatment in [13, 14, 15] was\nrestricted by low light intensities.\nIn the present paper we shall continue the investigations started in [13, 14]. Having in mind\nmainly atom optical applications, we shall derive the system of Maxwell-Schr\u00f6dinger equations\nfor the case of high density of the atoms and high light intensity. Nonlinear optical properties\nof the interacting Bose gas will be also discussed.\n\n2\n\nHeisenberg equations of motion for the atomic operators\n\nWe consider a system of ultracold two-level atoms with masses m, transition frequencies \u03c9a ,\nand transition dipole moments d. We shall describe such a system in terms of matter field\noperators. Let |gi and |ei are the vectors of the ground and excited states of the quantized\n\natomic fields. Then the corresponding annihilation operators of the atoms in these internal\nstates are \u03c6\u0302g and \u03c6\u0302e . Matter-field operators are assumed to satisfy the bosonic equal time\ncommutation relations.\nThe Heisenberg equations of motion for the atomic operators are derived from the Hamiltonian of the second quantized atomic field interacting with the photons. In the reference\nframe rotating with the frequency \u03c9L = ckL of the incident laser field Ein (r, t), which is assumed to be monochromatic, and in making use of the electric dipole approximation and the\nrotating-wave approximation we obtain the following dynamical equations for the matter-field\noperators [13, 14]\n\u2202 \u03c6\u0302g\n= \u0124cm \u03c6\u0302g + \u0124ge \u03c6\u0302e ,\n\u2202t\n\u2202 \u03c6\u0302e\nih\u0304\n= \u0124cm \u03c6\u0302e \u2212 h\u0304 (\u2206 + i\u03b3/2) \u03c6\u0302e + \u0124eg \u03c6\u0302g ,\n\u2202t\n\nih\u0304\n\n3\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\n\fwhere \u0124cm = \u2212h\u03042 \u22072 /(2m), \u2206 = \u03c9L \u2212 \u03c9a \u2212 \u03b4 is the detuning of the frequency of the laser wave\n\nfrom the frequency of the atomic transition, \u03b4 and \u03b3 are the Lamb shift and the spontaneous\nemission rate of a single atom in free space, respectively. Here we have introduced the operators\n\u2212\n\u0124eg = \u2212d\u00ca+\nloc and \u0124ge = \u2212d\u00caloc which are responsible for the transitions |gi \u2192 |ei and\n\n|ei \u2192 |gi, respectively. \u0124eg and \u0124ge are related to the operator of the local electric field\n\u00ca\u00b1\nloc (r, t). The positive-frequency part of this operator has the form\n+\n\u00ca+\nloc (r, t) = Ein (r) + i\n\nX\nk\u03bb\n\n+\n\nZ\n\ns\n\n2\u03c0h\u0304\u03c9k\ne\u03bb \u0109k\u03bb (0) exp [ikr \u2212 i (\u03c9k \u2212 \u03c9L ) t]\nV\n\ndr\u2032 \u2207 \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7\n\nP\u0302+ (r\u2032 , t \u2212 R/c) ikL R\ne\n,\nR\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u2207\u00d7 refers to the point r and the operator \u0109k\u03bb (0) corresponds to the free-space photon\n\nfield (vacuum fluctuations). The polarization operator P\u0302+ = d\u03c6\u0302\u2020g \u03c6\u0302e . Note that in equation\n(3) a small volume around the observation point r is excluded from the integration. The last\nterm in equation (3) describes dipole-dipole interaction. Due to the structure of the local field\ngiven by equation (3) one can distinguish two kinds of the photons: primary laser photons and\nsecondary photons, re-radiated by the atoms.\nUsually in atom optics of BEC one deals with equations for the ground state matter-field\noperator \u03c6\u0302g . Therefore, one has to eliminate the excited state matter-field operator \u03c6\u0302e from\nthe system of equations (1), (2). In the next section we shall develop a general procedure of\nthe elimination of the excited state which is in contrast to previous works (see, for instance,\n[3]) valid for high densities of the atoms and high intensities of the laser radiation.\n\n3\n\nElimination of the excited state\n\nLet's assume that initially there are no atoms in the excited state.

The\nnext term (m = 1) corresponds to the transition |gi \u2192 |ei \u2192 |gi \u2192 |ei and so on. Therefore,\n\ndifferent terms in equation (9) describe multiple transitions of the atoms between ground and\nexcited states, caused by the influence of the photons. In a typical atom optical situation when\nthe electromagnetic field has a form of a standing wave these terms correspond to the processes\nwith the momentum transfer from the laser beam to the atoms \u00b12h\u0304K(m + 1), where K is a\n\nwave vector of the laser wave in a medium.\n \u0303 2 ) acts only on states |\u03c8i for which the series in equation\nWe assume that \u01eb\u0302 = \u0124ge \u0124eg /(h\u03042 \u2206\n\n(9) converges, i.e., |\u03c8i can be decomposed into eigenstates of \u01eb\u0302 whose eigenvalues satisfy the\ncondition |\u01ebn | < 1/4.

However, by doing\n5\n\n\fsuch a procedure we would get an equation for the ground state wave function in a form which\nwould be impossible to use. Therefore, the algorithm described in this section does really\neliminate the excited state only in the case when the dipole-dipole interactions are negligible,\n\u00b1\ni.e., when \u00ca\u00b1\nloc \u2248 Ein . In order to eliminate the excited state in the case when the dipole-\n\ndipole interactions play an important role it is useful to employ in addition the Lorentz-Lorenz\nrelation, which will be briefly discussed in the next section.\nBecause we are mainly interested in atom optical problems and want to study the coherent evolution of the center-of-mass motion of the gas, we shall neglect spontaneous emission.\nThis is valid for situations where the absolute values of the detunings are much bigger than\n\nthe spontaneous emission rates and Rabi frequencies |\u2206| \u226b \u03b3 , dE\u00b1\nloc /h\u0304 . In order to do\nthis approximation self-consistently we drop in the following the vacuum fluctuations and the\n\nspontaneous emission rates \u03b3 from our equations. Then we may replace all the operators by\nmacroscopic functions.\n\n4\n\nLocal-field correction\n\nAs it was mentioned in the previous section, the solution of equations (3), (11), (12) is a rather\ncomplicated mathematical problem because these equations contain explicitly the dipole-dipole\ninteractions. In many particular situations such a detailed microscopic description of matter\nis not necessary and it is more convenient to consider optical properties of the medium on a\nmacroscopic level. This can be done by introducing the macroscopic field Emac (r, t), instead of\nthe local field Eloc (r, t) in the equations for the matter fields.\nAs in Ref. [16] we can introduce the macroscopic field by imposing the requirement that it is\na solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equations for a charge-free and current-free polarization\nmedium. Using Maxwell equations and the definition of the local field (3), we get the following\nrelation\n\n4\u03c0 \u00b1\nP (r, t) .\n(13)\n3\nThis equation is often called in the literature the Lorentz-Lorenz relation. It constitutes the\n\u00b1\nE\u00b1\nloc (r, t) = Emac (r, t) +\n\nbasis of the local-field effects in classical, quantum and nonlinear optics.\n\n5\n\nNonlinear matter equation\n\nLet's consider first a special case of the low light intensity. In this case we can keep only the\nfirst term (m = 0) in equation (9), which is linear with respect to the electromagnetic field\n6\n\n\fstrength:\n\u03c6e (r, t) = \u2212\n\ndE+\nloc (r)\n\u03c6g (r, t) .\nh\u0304\u2206\n\n(14)\n\nFrom equations (13), (14) we obtain\n\u221e\n4\u03c0\n\u03a9+ (r) X\n\u03b1 |\u03c6g (r, t)|2\n\u03c6e (r, t) = \u2212\n2\u2206 n=0 3\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013n\n\n\u03c6g (r, t) ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the position dependent Rabi frequency \u03a9+ (r) = 2dE+\nmac (r)/h\u0304 is related to the macroscopic electric field, \u03b1 = \u2212d2 /h\u0304\u2206 is the atomic polarizability. The series in (15) converges,\nprovided that\n\n4\u03c0\n|\u03b1| |\u03c6g |2\n3\n\n< 1.

However, as it\n\nfollows from our present derivation, we never encounter this singularity, because in the region\n4\u03c0\n|\u03b1| |\u03c6g |2\n3\n\nRef. [13].\n\n\u2265 1 equation (16) is not valid. This was not clear from the derivation given in\n\nThen substituting (16) in (1), we obtain as the result an equation for the ground state\nmatter field \u03c6g [13, 14]\nih\u0304\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\n2\n\n+\n\nh\u0304 \u2207\nh\u0304 |\u03a9 (r)|\n\u2202\u03c6g (r, t)\n= \u2212\n+\n\u03c6g (r, t) .\ni\nh\n\uf8f4\n2 2\uf8f4\n\u2202t\n2m\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe\n4\u2206 1 \u2212 4\u03c0\n\u03b1\n|\u03c6\n(r,\nt)|\ng\n3\n\n(17)\n\nNow we substitute the Lorentz-Lorenz relation (13) into equations (11),(12) and keep the\nterms up to the order 1/\u22063 .

As it follows from our physical interpretation of the expansion (9), the\nClausius-Mossotti formula corresponds to the quantum transition of the type |gi \u2192 |ei. There-\n\nfore, it takes into account pair interactions between the atoms when one atom emits a photon,\nthen this photon is absorbed by another atom and so on.\nIf we keep the terms up to the order 1/\u22063 , the expression for the polarization takes the\n\nform\n\n2\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\ndE+\nloc \uf8fa\n2\uf8ef\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nP = \u03b1 |\u03c6g | \uf8f01 \u2212 2 2 \uf8fb E\u00b1\nloc = \u03c7Emac ,\nh\u0304 \u2206\n\nwhere\n\n\u03c7 = \u03b1 |\u03c6g |\n\n2\n\n\"\n\n4\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n1+\n\u03b1 |\u03c6g |2 +\n\u03b1 |\u03c6g |2\n3\n3\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n(23)\n\n2#\n\n|dE+\nmac |\n\u2212\n2 2\nh\u0304 \u2206\n\n.\n\n(24)\n\nDielectric susceptibility is a rather important parameter, because it describes the propagation of the laser radiation inside a medium. In most of the practical situations the electromagnetic processes are much faster than the center-of-mass motion of the atoms. Therefore, \u03c7\ncan be considered as a time-independent quantity. Let us assume in addition that the spatial\nvariations of the atomic density are not very large, such that \u2207\u03c7 \u2192 0.

In general they have to\nbe solved in a self-consistent way.\n\n6.2\n\nPolariton band gap\n\nIn this section we investigate the polariton spectrum of a condensate interacting with an intense\nlaser field. Let's consider a special case of dilute atomic gas. In this case one can neglect the\n\u00b1\nlocal-field correction in equation (13) and we have E\u00b1\nloc (r, t) \u2248 Emac (r, t). In order to simplify\n\nthe analytical analysis we assume that the intensity of the laser radiation is not too high. Then\n\n9\n\n\ffrom Maxwell equations and equation (20) we get the following expression for the refractive\nindex\n\nR (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 )\n4\u03c0d2 |\u03c6g |2\n,\nR\n=\n,\nh\u0304\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 )2 + |\u03a9+ |2 /4\nwhich contains saturation effects, owing to the intense electric field.\nn2 (\u03c9) = 1 \u2212\n\n(27)\n\nThe polariton spectrum \u03c9(K) can be obtained from the equation\nK=\n\n\u03c9\nn(\u03c9) .\nc\n\n(28)\n\nAs it follows from equation (27) n(\u03c9) is imaginary for the frequencies \u03c9 within the range\n\u03c90 +\n\nR\u2212\n\nq\n\nR+\nR2 \u2212 |\u03a9+ |2\n< \u03c9 < \u03c90 +\n2\n\nq\n\nR2 \u2212 |\u03a9+ |2\n, R > \u03a9+ .\n2\n\n(29)\n\nIn this case equation (28) has no real solutions. This means that lightqcan not propagate in\na condensate, i.e., we get a polariton band gap with the width \u2206G =\n\nR2 \u2212 |\u03a9+ |2 . The gap\n\nwidth \u2206G increases with the density of the atoms in the ground state |\u03c6g |2 and decreases with\n\nthe laser intensity. In the case of the low light intensity (|\u03a9+ | \u226a R) we get a well-known result\n\n\u2206G = R [18, 19]. If R \u2264 |\u03a9+ |, equation (28) has only real solutions. This means that in this\n\ncase the polariton gap disappears and the medium is always transparent.\n\nNote that our analysis does not take into accout effects caused by the influence of the\nspontaneous emission. As it was discussed in Ref. [19], the spontaneous emission smears out\nthe polariton spectrum, providing accessible polariton states inside the gap.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nStarting from the microscopic model and making use of the multipolar formulation of QED,\nwe have derived the general system of Maxwell-Schr\u00f6dinger equations for atomic creation and\nannihilation operators and the propagation equation for the laser field. It describes the modification of the properties of the external off-resonant laser radiation in a medium due to dipoledipole interactions and the influence of this modification on the center-of-mass motion of the\nultracold atoms as a single dynamical process. The system can be used, for instance, for the\nself-consistent analysis of linear and nonlinear phenomena in atom optics at high densities of\nthe atomic system and high intensities of the laser radiation.\nA general procedure of the elimination of the excited state has been developed. The annihilation and creation operators of the excited state for large detuning are represented in the\nform of a series expansion in powers of the inverse detuning, which corresponds to multiple\ntransitions between the ground and excited electronic states of the atoms.\n10\n\n\fOptical properties of an interacting ultracold Bose gas are studied: formula for the intensitydependent refractive index is derived and the polariton spectrum of a condensate interacting\nwith an intense laser field is investigated.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the Optikzentrum\nKonstanz.
