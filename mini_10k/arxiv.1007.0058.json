An important tool is Voiculescu's subordination\nproperty for operator-valued free convolution.\n\n1. introduction\nThe study of problems in operator algebras from a probabilistic perspective recorded numerous successes in the recent decades. Notions of independence\nspecific to noncommutative probability setting - especially Voiculescu's free independence - were shown to be important for encoding structural properties of\ncertain operator algebras. Numerous analogues of classical probabilistic notions\nand phenomena were found to hold for free, Boolean or conditionally free independences. In particular, conditional expectations in the context of noncommutative\nalgebras are old and well-known; however, noncommutative independences over\nsubalgebras with respect to conditional expectations are new and not yet very well\nstudied and understood: it was Voiculescu [25] who generalized his own free independence to freeness (with amalgamation) over a noncommutative subalgebra,\nwhile for the monotone independence of Muraki [12], Boolean independence of Speicher and Woroudi [21] and the conditionally free independence and convolution of\nBo\u017cejko, Leinert and Speicher [8], the generalization was achieved by Popa [15, 16]\nand [17].\nLet us briefly introduce some of the more important notions from noncommutative probability that we will study in this paper. We shall call a noncommutative probability space a pair (A, \u03c6), where A is a unital \u2217-algebra over the complex\nnumbers and \u03c6 : A \u2192 C is a positive functional normalized so that it carries the\nunit 1 \u2208 A of A into the complex number 1. The algebra A plays the role of the\nalgebra of complex-valued measurable functions on a classical probability space and\n\u03c6 plays the role of integration with respect to the probability measure. By following\nthis analogy, an operator-valued noncommutative probability space is naturally defined as a triple (A, EB , B), where A is again a unital \u2217-algebra, B is a \u2217-subalgebra\nof A containing the unit of A and EB : A \u2192 B is a conditional expectation, i.e. a\npositive linear B \u2212 B bimodule map. (In some contexts, this definition will turn out\nto be too restrictive or too broad; thus, we will usually specify our requirements,\nassumptions and notations on a case-by-case basis.) When B = C, we deal with an\nDate: November 7, 2018.\nResearch of STB was supported by a Discovery grant from NSERC Canada, and a University\nof Saskatchewan start-up grant.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nS. T. BELINSCHI, M. POPA, AND V. VINNIKOV\n\nordinary noncommutative probability space. Elements X \u2208 A are called random\nvariables or (in the second context) operator-valued (or B-valued) random variables.\nIf (A, \u03c6) is a non-commutative probability space, the distribution of a selfadjoint element X of A (non-commutative random variable) is a real measure \u03bcX\ndescribed via\nZ\n\ntn d\u03bcX (t) = \u03c6(X n ).\n\nAs shown in [25], for the operator-valued non-commutative random variables, the\nappropriate analogue of the distribution is an element of \u03a3B , the set of positive\nconditional expectations from the \u2217-algebra of non-commutative polynomials with\ncoefficients in some C\u2217 -algebra B to B. In this setting, the op-valued analogues of\ncompactly supported real measures are positive conditional expectations from \u03a3B\nwith moments not growing faster than exponentially (see below).\nIn probability theory limit theorems play a central role. Historically,\namong the first results proved for each new type of noncommutative independence\nwas a Central Limit Theorem: Voiculescu identified the Wigner law as the free central limit for scalar-valued free independence [23] and its operator-valued analogue\n[25], Muraki [12] showed that the arcsine distribution is the monotone central limit\nand Popa [15] identified an operator-valued analogue for the arcsine, Speicher and\nWoroudi [21] proved the Boolean central limit theorem, and Bo\u017cejko, Leinert and\nSpeicher [8] described the pairs of measures that appear as conditionally free central\nlimits. However, the \"most general\" limit theorems involve so-called infinitesimal\narrays, and the limit distributions are usually shown to identify with infinitely divisible distributions. Some descriptions/characterizations of infinite divisibility are\nknown for all noncommutative scalar independences [5, 21, 12, 11, 28], but very\nlittle is known about operator-valued infinite divisibility; until recently, the only\nexception we know of was Speicher's work [20]. In a recent breakthrough, Popa and\nVinnikov [18] gave a description of free, Boolean and conditionally free infinitely\ndivisible distributions in terms of their linearizing transforms that parallels the results of Bercovici and Voiculescu [5], Speicher and Woroudi [21] and Krysztek [11],\nrespectively. In this paper we will use some of the results from [18], the subordination result of Voiculescu [26] and the theory of noncommutative functions to prove\na Hin\u00e7in type theorem for free and conditionally free convolutions and to identify\noperator-valued analogues of the Bercovici-Pata bijection [4]. In addition, we prove\na generalization to conditionally free convolution of the result of Belinschi and Nica\n[3] which states that the Boolean Bercovici-Pata bijection is a homomorphism with\nrespect to free multiplicative convolution.\nOur paper is organized as follows: in the second section we define the main\nnotions and tools that we shall use, and prove a few preparatory results, in Section\n3 we prove a Hin\u010din type theorem for certain infinitesimal arrays of operator-valued\nrandom variables; using this result, we obtain a restricted Boolean-to-free BercoviciPata bijection, in Section 4 we prove our main result, the Boolean-to-conditionally\nfree Bercovici-Pata bijection, and finally in Section 5 we show that the Boolean-toconditionally free Bercovici-Pata bijection for scalar-valued random variables is a\nhomomorphism with respect to multiplicative c-free convolution.\n\n\fINFINITE DIVISIBILITY, NON-COMMUTATIVE BERCOVICI-PATA BIJECTION\n\n3\n\n2. independences, transforms and subordination\nWe start with a precise definition of an operator valued distribution. Generally, we will assume that B is a unital C*-algebra. We will denote by BhX i the\n\u2217-algebra freely generated by B and the selfadjoint symbol X . We will also use\nthe notation BhX1 , X2 , . . . i for the \u2217-algebra freely generated by B and the noncommutating self-adjoint symbols X1 , X2 , . . . . The set of all positive conditional\nexpectations from BhX i to B will be denoted by \u03a3B .\nFor B \u2286 D a unital inclusion of C\u2217 -algebras, we denote by \u03a3B:D the set of\nall unital, positive B-bimodule maps \u03bc : BhX i \u2212\u2192 D with the property that for all\npositive integers n and all {fi (X )}ni=1 \u2282 BhX i we have that:\n\u0002\n(1)\n\u03bc(fj (X )\u2217 fi (X ))]ni,j=1 \u2265 0 in Mn (B).\n\nRemark that \u03a3B = \u03a3B:B , as an easy consequence of Exercise 3.18 from [14].\nUsing these notations, we define the distribution of an operator-valued\nrandom variable:\nDefinition 2.1. If B \u2286 A, B \u2286 D are unital inclusions of \u2217-algebras, respectively\nC\u2217 -algebras, \u03c6 : A \u2212\u2192 D is a unital positive B-bimodule map and a is a selfadjoint\nelement of A, we will denote by Bhai the \u2217-algebra generated in A by B and a and by\n\u03c6a , \"the D-distribution\" of a, that is the positive B-bimodule map \u03c6a : BhX i \u2212\u2192 D\ndefined by \u03c6a = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c4a where \u03c4a : BhX i \u2212\u2192 A is the unique homomorphism such\nthat \u03c4a (X ) = a and \u03c4a (b) = b for all b \u2208 B.\nWe will denote by \u03a30B:D the set of elements from \u03a3B:D with the property\nthat there exists some M > 0 such that, for all b1 , . . . , bn \u2208 B we have that\n||\u03bc(X b1 X b2 * * * X bn X )|| < M n+1 ||b1 || * * * ||bn ||.\n\n(2)\n\nWith the notations from Definition 2.1, an element \u03bc \u2208 \u03a3B:D can be\nrealized as \u03c6a for some C\u2217 -algebra A containing B and a a self-adjoint from A if\nand only if \u03bc \u2208 \u03a30B:D (see [18], Proposition 1.2).\n2.1. Independences. There are several independences important for noncommutative probability. We shall start with the oldest and best-known, Voiculescu's free\nindependence. We present it in a C\u2217 -algebraic context.\nDefinition 2.2. Let B be a C\u2217 -algebra, B \u2286 A be a unital inclusion of \u2217-algebras\nand \u03c6 : A \u2192 B be a positive conditional expectation. A family {Xi }i\u2208I of selfadjoint\nelements from A is said to be free with respect to \u03c6 if\n\u03c6(A1 A2 * * * An ) = 0\nwhenever Aj \u2208 BhX\u01eb(j) i with \u03c6(Aj ) = 0, where \u01eb(j) \u2208 I, with \u01eb(k) 6= \u01eb(k + 1) for\n1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1.\nLet now N \u2208 N and {\u03bcj }N\nj=1 be a family of elements from \u03a3B . We define\ntheir additive free convolution the following way: Consider the symbols {Xj }N\nj=1 ;\non the algebra BhX1 , X2 , . . . , XN i take the conditional expectation \u03bc such that\n\u03bc \u25e6 \u03c4Xj = \u03bcj and the mixed moments of X1 , . . . , Xn are computed via the rules\nfrom Definition 2.2. The free additive convolution of {\u03bcj }N\nj=1 is the conditional\nexpectation\n\u229eN \u03bcj = \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c4X +X +***+X : BhX1 + X2 + * * * + XN i \u223c\n= BhX i \u2212\u2192 B.\nj=1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nN\n\n\f4\n\nS. T. BELINSCHI, M. POPA, AND V. VINNIKOV\n\nWe have that \u229eN\nj=1 \u03bcj is also an element of \u03a3B : in [20] it is shown that \u03bc,\ndefined as above, is a positive conditional expectation, therefore so is \u03bc\u25e6\u03c4X1 +X2 +***+XN .\nSecondly, we give the op-valued equivalent of Speicher and Woroudi's\nBoolean independence [21] as it appears in [18]:\nDefinition 2.3. Let B \u2286 A, B \u2286 D be unital inclusions of \u2217-algebras, and \u03c6 : A \u2192\nD a unital completely positive B-bimodule map. A family {Xi }i\u2208I of selfadjoint\nelements from A is said to be Boolean independent with respect to \u03c6 if\n\u03c6(A1 A2 * * * An ) = \u03c6(A1 )\u03c6(A2 ) * * * \u03c6(An )\n\nwhenever Aj is in the nonunital \u2217-subalgebra over B generated by Xj , where \u01eb(j) \u2208 I\nwith \u01eb(k) 6= \u01eb(k + 1) for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1.\nThe definition of Boolean convolutions of distributions from \u03a3B:D is done\nsimilarly to free convolutions of distributions from \u03a3B , as shown in [18], by simply\nreplacing free with Boolean independence. The reader will observe that this definition makes sense for B = D; the broader context that we provide adds in fact more\ndepth to the theory. This will become clearer in the following definition, which\nessentially unites free and Boolean independence.\nWe aim to extend the results that can be obtained for free independence\nto the case \u03bc \u2208 \u03a3B:D . In this setting, if B is simply replaced by D, the resulting\nrelation does not uniquely determine the joint moments of X1 , . . . , Xn . As shown\nin [7, 6], a more suitable approach is the c-freeness (see also [17] and [8]).\nDefinition 2.4. Let B \u2286 A, B \u2286 D be unital inclusions of \u2217-algebras, EB : A \u2212\u2192 B\nbe a positive conditional expectation and \u03b8 : A \u2212\u2192 D be a unital B-bimodule map.\nThe family {Xi }i\u2208I of selfadjoint elements from A is said to be c-free with\nrespect to (\u03b8, \u03c6) if\n(i) the family {Xi }i\u2208I is free with respect to EB\n(ii) \u03b8(A1 A2 * * * An ) = \u03b8(A1 )\u03b8(A2 ) * * * \u03b8(An ) for all Ai \u2208 BhX\u01eb(i) i such that\nEB (Ai ) = 0 and \u01eb(k) 6= \u01eb(k + 1).\nThe reason for switching to the notation EB will be seen later. We will\nconsider the above relations in the framework of B \u2282 D a unital inclusion of C\u2217 algebras and \u03b8 a completely positive map.As shown in [7], this setting (that includes\n\u03a3B:D is closed with respect to c-free convolution.\nNext, we describe one of our main tools in analyzing distributions of\nsums of independent (freely, Boolean or c-freely) operator-valued random variables,\nnamely noncommutative sets and functions [10]. We will use the terminology from\n[10] (see also [22], [18], but translating the results in the different terminology from\n[27] is trivial.)\nFor a vector space V over C, we let Mn\u00d7m (V), denote n \u00d7 m matrices over\nV and write Mn (V) for Mn\u00d7n (V). We define the noncommutative space over V by\n\u221e\na\nVnc =\nMn (V). We call \u03a9 \u2286 Vnc a noncommutative set if it is closed under direct\nn=1\n\nsums. Explicitly, denoting \u03a9n = \u03a9 \u2229 Mn (V), we have\n\u0014\n\u0015\na 0\na\u2295b=\n\u2208 \u03a9n+m\n0 b\n\nfor all a \u2208 \u03a9n , b \u2208 \u03a9m .

A mapping f : \u03a9 \u2192 Wnc with f (\u03a9n ) \u2286 Mn (W) is called a noncommutative\nfunction if f satisfies the following two conditions:\n\u2022 f respects direct sums: f (a \u2295 b) = f (a) \u2295 f (b) for all a, b \u2208 \u03a9.\n\u2022 f respects similarities: if a \u2208 \u03a9n and s \u2208 Mn (C) is invertible with sas\u22121 \u2208\n\u03a9n , then f (sas\u22121 ) = sf (a)s\u22121 .\nWe will denote f (n) = f |\u03a9n : \u03a9n \u2192 Mn (W). For convenience, we will refer sometimes, when there is no risk of confusion, to f (n) and \u03a9n as the nth coordinate of\nthe respective noncommutative function and set.\nA noncommutative set \u03a9 \u2286 Vnc is called upper admissible if for all a \u2208 \u03a9n ,\nb \u2208 \u03a9m and all c \u2208 Mn\u00d7m (V), there exists \u03bb \u2208 C, \u03bb 6= 0, such that\n\u0014\n\u0015\na \u03bbc\n\u2208 \u03a9n+m .\n0 b\nNon-commutative functions on upper-admissible sets admit a consistent differential calculus, including Taylor expansions by defining the (right) noncommutative\ndifference-differential operators by evaluating a noncommutative function on block\nupper triangular matrices (see again [10]). In this paper we will use only the following three upper admissible noncommutative sets (A will denote a C\u2217 -algebra):\n`\u221e\n(1) The set Nilp(A) = n=1 Nilp(A; n); here the set Nilp(A; n) consists of all\na \u2208 Mn (A) such that ar = 0 for some r, where we view a as a matrix over\nthe tensor algebra T(A) of A over C\n(2) Noncommutative balls B(A, \u03c1) = {a \u2208 Anc : kak < \u03c1} of radius \u03c1 > 0 over A\n(A could have been replaced by any operator space with the corresponding\noperator space norm).\n(3) Noncommutative half-planes H+ (Anc ) = {a \u2208 Anc : Ia > 0} over A. Here\nIa = (a \u2212 a\u2217 )/2i denotes the imaginary part of a. (We say that an element\nb in a unital C\u2217 -algebra satisfies b > 0 if there exists \u03b5 \u2208 (0, +\u221e) so that\nb \u2265 \u03b51, where here 1 is the unit of A; of course, for an element a \u2208 Anc\nto have imaginary part strictly greater than zero means simply that each\n\"coordinate\" has imaginary part strictly positive.) It has been first noted\nby Voiculescu [27] that H+ (Anc ) is indeed a noncommutative set.\n2.2. Op-valued distributions and properties of their transforms. As for\nscalar-valued (non)commutative probability, there are transforms that linearize different kinds of convolutions of operator-valued distributions. It turns out that these\ntransforms can be described in terms of noncommutative functions defined on noncommutative spaces, associated to operator-valued distributions. First, we introduce some terminology and notations. If A \u2287 B is a unital inclusion of \u2217-algebras\nand EB : A \u2192 B is a conditional expectation, then EMn (B) = EB \u2297 1n : Mn (A) \u2192\nMn (B) is still a conditional expectation for any n \u2208 N and any linear functional (in\nparticular any trace \u03c4 ) on B extends to \u03c4 \u2297 trn : B \u2297 Mn (C) \u2192 C, where trn is the\ncanonical normalized trace on Mn (C). Note also that if X, Y \u2208 A are free, boolean\nindependent, respectively c-free with respect to EB and \u03c6 : A \u2192 D for some algebra\nD containing B, then so are X \u2297 1n and Y \u2297 1n with respect to EMn (B) and \u03c6 \u2297 1n .\nWe recall that a \u2208 A is called selfadjoint if a = a\u2217 . Any element a \u2208 A\nin a \u2217-algebra can be written uniquely a = Ra + iIa, where Ra = (a + a\u2217 )/2,\nIa = (a \u2212 a\u2217 )/(2i) are selfadjoint. For any given \u2217-algebra A on which a notion\n\n\f6\n\nS. T. BELINSCHI, M. POPA, AND V. VINNIKOV\n\nof positivity coherent with the star operation has been defined, we shall denote the\nupper half-plane of A by\n\nH+ (A) = {a \u2208 A : Ia > 0},\n`\u221e\nand H\u2212 (A) = \u2212H+ (A). (Thus, H+ (Anc ) = n=1 H+ (Mn (A)); see also [27].) We\nnote that a \u2208 H+ (A) =\u21d2 a\u2217 \u2208 H\u2212 (A).\nA useful generalization, noted by Voiculescu, of the fact that the operation\nof taking inverse changes the imaginary part of a complex number from positive\nto negative and vice-versa is the following implication, which holds in any unital\n\u2217-algebra in which analytic functional calculus is available:\n(3)\n\na \u2208 H+ (A) =\u21d2 a\u22121 \u2208 H\u2212 (A).\n\n(Note that the invertibility of a is part of the statement.) Indeed, by writing\nu = Ra, v = Ia, and a = u + iv, we have\n\u221a \u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\na = u + iv = u + i( v)2 = v[( v)\u22121 u( v)\u22121 + i] v.\nThe ability to take square root is guaranteed by\nfunctional calculus\n\u221a\n\u221a the analytic\nand the fact that v > \u03b51A for some \u03b5 > 0.

Invertibility of v, again guaranteed by its strict positivity and the existence\nof analytic functional calculus, implies that a is itself invertible in A.

For a given \u03bc \u2208 \u03a3B:D , we define its moment-generating series as the\nnon-commutative function of components\nM\u03bc(n) (b) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=0\n\n(\u03bc \u2297 1n )([X * b]k ) =\n\n1n + (\u03bc \u2297 1n )(X * b)\n\n+(\u03bc \u2297 1n )(X * b * X * b) + * * * .\n\nAs shown in [18], M\u03bc is always well-defined on Nilp(B). Moreover, from\nEngel's Theorem, a \u2208 Nilp(Mn (B)) if and only if T aT \u22121 is strictly upper triangular\nfor some T \u2208 GL(n), therefore T [M\u03bc (b) \u2212 1]T \u22121 is also upper-triangular hence\nM\u03bc (b) \u2212 1 \u2208 Nilp(D). As in [18], we used the symbol 1 for Idn on each component\nfrom Mn (B). If \u03bc \u2208 \u03a30B:D , then M\u03bc is also well-defined on a small non-commutative\nball from Bnc which is mapped in a non-commutative ball from Dnc .\nFor \u03bd \u2208 \u03a3B and \u03bc \u2208 \u03a3B:D we define their R-, respectively B-transforms\nvia the functional equations\n(5)\n(6)\n\nM\u03bd (b) \u2212 1 =\nM\u03bc (b) \u2212 1 =\n\nR\u03bd (b * M\u03bd (b))\nB\u03bc (b) * M\u03bc (b)\n\nIn [18] is is shown that the R- and B-transforms are non-commutative functions\nwell-defined on Nilp(B). If \u03bd \u2208 \u03a30B , respectively \u03bc \u2208 \u03a30B:D , then R\u03bd and B\u03bc are also\nwell-defined in some non-commutative balls from Bnc .\nThe main reason for which we have introduced the R and B-transforms is\ntheir linearizing property: we have\n(7)\n(8)\n\nR\u03bc\u229e\u03bd (b) = R\u03bc (b) + R\u03bd (b),\nB\u03bc\u228e\u03bd (b) = B\u03bc (b) + B\u03bd (b),\n\n\u03bc, \u03bd \u2208 \u03a3B ,\n\u03bc, \u03bd \u2208 \u03a3B:D .\n\nThe first result is due to Voiculescu [25], and the second to Popa [16].\nWe warn the reader that the other version of the R-transform, defined\nbelow, namely the original one of Voiculescu, as well as the one used by Dykema\n(that we will call here R), is related to this version by a simple multiplication to\nthe right with the variable b: R\u03bc (b) = R\u03bc (b)b.\nDepending on the functional context, sometimes it is convenient to use\nslight variations of these transforms, which benefit of similar properties. We start\nwith the most straightforward: following [15], we introduce the shifted moment\ngenerating function H\u03bc of \u03bc \u2208 \u03a3B:D as the non-commutative function of components\n(n)\nH(n)\n\u03bc (b) = b * M\u03bc (b).\n\n(1)\n\nWhen there is no risk of confusion, we will denote H\u03bc also by H\u03bc .\nFor a better understanding of the way noncommutative functions generalize the classical functions associated to probability distributions, it will be convenient to express the transform H\u03bc in terms of the generalized resolvent or operatorvalued Cauchy transform. Several properties of scalar-valued Cauchy transforms\n(easily proved, but available also in [1, Chapter III]) are preserved when we pass to\nthe operator-valued context. We shall express the operator-valued Cauchy transform first in terms of random variables. Suppose that B \u2282 A, B \u2282 D are inclusions\n\n\f8\n\nS. T. BELINSCHI, M. POPA, AND V. VINNIKOV\n\nof unital C\u2217 -algebras and \u03c6 : A \u2192 D is a completely positive B-bimodule map. For\n(n)\nany fixed X = X \u2217 \u2208 A we let GX = (GX )n ,\n(n)\n\nGX : H+ (Mn (B)) \u2192 H\u2212 (Mn (D)),\n\n(n)\n\nGX (b) = \u03c6n [(b \u2212 X \u2297 Idn )\u22121 ],\n\nwhere \u03c6n is the extension of \u03c6 from Mn (A) to Mn (D). For n = 1 we shall denote\n(1)\nGX (b) simply by GX (b). Let us first remark that this expression makes sense:\nindeed, since Ib > 0 and X = X \u2217 , it follows that I(b \u2212 X \u2297 Idn ) > 0, so, as noted\nin (3), b \u2212 X \u2297 Idn is invertible in A and its inverse has strictly negative imaginary\n(n)\npart. Since \u03c6 is completely positive, it follows in addition that GX takes values in\nthe lower matricial half-plane.\nP\u221e\nWe observe that, whenever kb\u22121 k < 1/kXk, we can write GX (b) = n=0 b\u22121 \u03c6[(Xb\u22121 )n ]\nas a convergent series. Thus, it follows easily that for \u03bc \u2208 \u03a30B:D we shall write\nG(n)\n\u03bc (b) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u03bc \u2297 Idn )(b\u22121 (X * b\u22121 )n ) = (\u03bc \u2297 Idn )[(b \u2212 X )\u22121 ];\n\nn=0\n\n(of course, these equalities require that we consider an extension of \u03bc to BhhX ii,\nthe algebra of formal power series generated freely by B and the selfadjoint symbol\nX ). This also indicates a very important equality, namely, for \u03bc \u2208 \u03a30B:D\nG\u03bc (b\u22121 ) = H\u03bc (b),\n\n(9)\n\nb \u2208 H+ (Mn (B)).\n\nMoreover, G\u03bc (b\u2217 ) = [G\u03bc (b)]\u2217 extends G\u03bc to the lower half-planes, analytically\nthrough points b with inverse of small norm.\n`\n+\nIt has been shown by Voiculescu [27] that H(Bnc ) = \u221e\nn=1 H (Mn (B))\nand GX with the structures defined above are fully matricial sets and functions. It\nis easy to observe that the same is true for FX , the reciprocals of GX , namely\nFX (b) = [GX (b)]\u22121 ,\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nFX (b) = [GX (b)]\u22121 .\n\nRemark 2.5. When X is a B-valued selfadjoint random variable, the transform\nF has many properties in common with its scalar-valued analogue. First of all, it\n(n)\nfollows straightforwardly from the similar property of G that FX necessarily maps\n+\nH (Mn (B)) into itself. Moreover, under the condition that B has a rich enough\ncollection of positive linear functionals (for example if it is a C \u2217 -algebra) we always\n(n)\nhave IFX (b) \u2265 Ib for all b \u2208 H+ (Mn (B)). Indeed, for n = 1, for any fixed positive\nlinear functional f on B, let us define FX,f (z) = f (FX (Rb + zIb)). Clearly, since\nIb > 0, we have that FX,f : H+ (C) \u2192 H+ (C).

The Nevanlinna representation of FX,f implies that\nIFX,f (z) \u2265 f (Ib) Iz for all z \u2208 H+ (C), and so, since this holds for all positive\nlinear functionals f on B, IFX (b) \u2265 Ib for all b \u2208 H+ (B). Moreover, we note that\n\n\fINFINITE DIVISIBILITY, NON-COMMUTATIVE BERCOVICI-PATA BIJECTION\n\n9\n\nif equality holds for a given b0 , then X \u2212 Rb0 must be a multiple of the identity of\n(n)\nB. The argument for a general component FX is analogous.\n(10)\n\nWe would like also to mention the connection between F and B:\n1 \u2212 F\u03bc (b\u22121 )b = B\u03bc (b),\n\nb\u22121 \u2208 H+ (Bnc ).\n\nFor classical measures it is known that weak convergence to a finite measure is equivalent to uniform convergence on compact sets for the Cauchy transforms\nto the Cauchy transform of the limit, and, if all measures involved are compactly\nsupported, these two statements\nare equivalent to theR convergence of moments (we\nR\nsay \u03c3n \u2192 \u03c3 in moments if tj d\u03c3n (t) converges to tj d\u03c3(t) for any j \u2208 N.) We\nshall provide below two versions of this result for operator-valued distributions.\nFirst, let us define convergence in moments for an operator-valued distribution.\nDefinition 2.6. Given a sequence of distributions \u03bcn \u2208 \u03a3B:D , we say that\n(a) \u03bcn converges to \u03bc \u2208 \u03a3B:D pointwise in moments if for any \u03c6 \u2208 D\u2217 we have\nlim \u03bcn (X b1 X b2 * * * bj X ) = \u03bc(X b1 X b2 * * * bj X ),\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nfor all b1 , . . . , bj \u2208 B;\n(b) \u03bcn norm-converges to \u03bc \u2208 \u03a3B:D in moments if\nlim\n\nsup\n\nn\u2192\u221e kb k=1,1\u2264k\u2264j\nk\n\nk\u03bcn (X b1 X b2 * * * X bj X ) \u2212 \u03bc(X b1 X b2 * * * X bj X )k = 0,\n\nfor all j \u2208 N.\n\nRemark first that for finite dimensional algebra B the two notions are\nequivalent. Also, remark that condition [(b)] is equivalent to\n(b\u2032 ) lim M\u03bcn (b) = M\u03bc (b), for all b \u2208 Nilp(B).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nIn this paper we will mainly be interested in norm-convergence of moments.\nWe note next the following simple remark:\nRemark 2.7. Assume that B \u2286 D is a unital inclusion of von Neumann algebras\nand {\u03bcn }n\u2208N is sequence from \u03a30B:D Then \u03bcn converges pointwise in moments to\n\u03bc \u2208 \u03a30B:D if and only if G\u03bcn converges pointwise to G\u03bc on H+ (Bnc ).\n\nProof. First, let us assume that \u03bcn converges to \u03bc pointwise in moments. It suffices\nto prove that for any state \u03c6 on Mm (D) we have that\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(m)\nlim \u03c6 G(m)\n\u03bcn (b) = \u03c6 G\u03bc (b) .\nn\u2212\u2192\u221e\n\n(m)\n\nLet \u03c6\u0001 as above and b \u2208 H+ (Mm (B)). The function H+ (C) \u220b z 7\u2192 \u03c6 G\u03bcn (Rb +\nzIb) is the Cauchy transform of some positive real measure \u03c3n,\u03c6,b . Indeed,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u22121\n),\n\u03c6(G(m)\n\u03bcn (Rb + zIb)) = \u03c6((\u03bcn \u2297 1m ) (Rb + zIb \u2212 X )\n(m)\n\nand since \u03c6, \u03bcn \u2297 1m , Ib and Iz are all positive, it follows that I\u03c6(G\u03bcn (Rb +\nzIb)) < 0. Moreover,\n\u0002\n\u0003\nlim z(\u03bcn \u2297 1m ) (Rb + zIb \u2212 X )\u22121 =\nz\u2192\u221e\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u221e\nX\n((Rb \u2212 X )(Ib)\u22121 )j\n(Ib)\u22121 (\u03bcn \u2297 1m )\n(11)\nlim\nz\u2192\u221e\nzj\nj=0\n= (Ib)\u22121\n\n\f10\n\nS.

VINNIKOV\n\n(the limit is in the norm topology of Mm (D); these expressions make sense for |z|\nlarge enough because of the exponential growth condition) Hence applying \u03c6 and\nusing that Ib > 0 gives the result. Thus, according to [1], Chapter III, we have\nthat\nZ\n(m)\n\u03c6(G\u03bcn (Rb + zIb)) = (z \u2212 t)\u22121 d\u03c3n,\u03c6,b (t),\nR\n\nwith \u03c3n,\u03c6,b (R) = \u03c6((Ib)\u22121 ). We observe in addition that\nZ\n\u0003\u0001\n\u0002\ntj d\u03c3n,\u03c6,b (t) = \u03c6 (\u03bcn \u2297 1m ) (Ib)\u22121 ((Rb \u2212 X )(Ib)\u22121 )j ,\nR\n\nso by our hypothesis and the continuity of the multiplication with the constant\n(Ib)\u22121 we obtain that the moments of \u03c3n,\u03c6,b (t) converge. Normality of the family\n(m)\n{\u03c6(G\u03bcn (Rb + zIb))}n guarantees that a weak limit of this sequence of measures\n(m)\nexists, and the limit has the prescribed moments. We conclude that \u03c6(G\u03bcn (Rb +\n(m)\nzIb)) converges to \u03c6(G\u03bc (Rb + zIb)) uniformly on compacts of H+ (C) for any\n+\nfixed b \u2208 H (Mm (B)).\n(m)\n(m)\nAssume next that limn\u2192\u221e G\u03bcn (b)) = G\u03bc (b)) for any m and any b \u2208\n(m)\nH+ (Mm (B)). We define again \u03c3n,\u03c6,b as above and observe that \u03c6(G\u03bcn (Rb +\nzIb)) is the Cauchy transform of this measure and it converges uniformly on\ncompacts of the complex upper half-plane to the Cauchy transform of a limit\nmeasure \u03c3\u03c6,b\u0002.

However, in order to be able to prove the\nsimilar result for norm-convergence of moments in the most general C\u2217 -algebraic\ncontext, we will have to require that.\nProposition 2.11.

BELINSCHI, M. POPA, AND V. VINNIKOV\n\nThe last two results have established the connection between transforms\nand distributions in the most general case that we will consider.\nRemark 2.12.\n(a) Due to the relevance of this particular case, we emphasize again that if B, D\nare finite dimensional, then the sequence {\u03bcn }n\u2208N from Proposition 2.11 needs not\nbe uniformly bounded. Indeed, generally local compactness of finite dimensional\nspaces makes proofs considerably simpler. Unfortunately, infinite dimensional Banach spaces are not locally compact in the norm topology, so in particular closed\nballs are not compact. However, some properties of analytic maps on finite dimensional spaces remain true, including the continuity of composition operation [9,\nTheorem 1.10].\n(b) Using Theorem 2.10 and [9, Theorem 1.10], we can replace the Cauchy transform\nG in Proposition 2.11 with any of the transforms F , B, M , H, or, if B = D, R.\n(c) Not the same thing can be said about the lemma preceding it; in that case, in the\nmost general context G can only be replaced by H or M . However, there are many\nspecial cases in which G can be replaced by F or R.\nWe introduce a few other new transforms and modifications of the transforms already introduced which will be of use to us. We recall the R-transform,\nwhich can be expressed as R\u03bc (b) = G\u03bc\u22121 (b) \u2212 b\u22121 for b invertible and of small norm,\nand which linearizes free additive convolution. (We use the convention that the \u22121\nas exponent on the letter which denotes a function means compositional inverse,\nwhile a \u22121 exponent on the function evaluated in a point means the multiplicative inverse of the value of the function in that point: thus, f (b)f (b)\u22121 = 1, while\nf (f \u22121 (b)) = b.) From it we shall define the Voiculescu transform \u03c6\u03bc of \u03bc simply\nas \u03c6\u03bc (b) = R\u03bc (b\u22121 ). This function is easily seen to be defined on an open set in B\nand F\u03bc (\u03c6\u03bc (b) + b) = b, so I\u03c6\u03bc (b) \u2264 0 whenever Ib > 0. Obviously, the Voiculescu\ntransform also satisfies\n\u03c6\u03bc (b) + \u03c6\u03bd (b) = \u03c6\u03bc\u229e\u03bd (b).\n(10):\n(14)\n\nFinally, denoting h\u03bc (b) = F\u03bc (b) \u2212 b, b \u2208 H+ (Bnc ), we re-write (8) using\nh\u03bc\u228e\u03bd (b) = h\u03bc (b) + h\u03bd (b) b \u2208 H+ (Bnc ).\n\nWe shall deal next with linearizing transforms for conditionally free convolutions. Distributions (\u03bc, \u03bd) \u2208 \u03a3B:D \u00d7 \u03a3B can be associated a linearizing transform\nfor c-free convolution, the c R-transform. It is defined by the functional equation\n(15)\n\n[M\u03bc (b) \u2212 1] * M\u03bd (b) = M\u03bc (b) * c R\u03bc,\u03bd (bM\u03bd (b)).\n\n(We remind the reader that the second coordinate is linearized by the R-transform.)\nNote that when B = D and EB = \u03b8 in Definition 2.4 we obtain \u03bc = \u03bd,\nso c-free convolution simply coincides with free convolution for both coordinates.\nIn addition, if \u03bd is the distribution of the zero random variable (corresponding to\nM\u03bd (b) = 1), then we obtain M\u03bc (b) \u2212 1 = M\u03bc (b)c R\u03bc,\u03bd (b), which is equivalent to the\ndefinition of the B-transform. Thus, conditionally free convolution can be viewed\nas interpolating between free and Boolean convolution, as in the scalar case [8].\nWe will often work in terms of selfadjoint random variables, and not elements in \u03a3B:D or \u03a30B:D ; of course, the two approaches are fully equivalent.\n\n\fINFINITE DIVISIBILITY, NON-COMMUTATIVE BERCOVICI-PATA BIJECTION\n\n15\n\n2.3. Voiculescu's subordination result and c-freeness. Next, we come to the\nproblem of subordination (the reason why we chose in one of the above definitions to\nwrite conditional expectation from A to B as EB instead of \u03c6). Generally we denote\nby EV the conditional expectation from the \"large\" algebra onto the subalgebra V.\nVoiculescu shows in [26, Theorem 3.8] that\nTheorem 2.13. Assume that the selfadjoint operator valued random variables\nX and Y are free with amalgamation over B. Then there exists a unique map\n\u03c9 (n) : H+ (Mn (B)) \u2192 H+ (Mn (B)) so that\n(16) EMn (BhXi) [(b \u2212 (X + Y ) \u2297 1n )\u22121 ] = [\u03c9 (n) (b) \u2212 X \u2297 1n ]\u22121 ,\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nb \u2208 H+ (Mn (B)).\n\nIn particular, GX+Y (b) = GX (\u03c9 (n) (b)) for all n \u2208 N, b \u2208 H+ (Mn (B)). In addition,\n\u03c9 = (\u03c9 (n) )n is a non-commutative function and I\u03c9(b) \u2265 Ib for all b \u2208 H+ (Bnc ).\nNow let us look at the subordination problem from two different perspectives. First, pick A, B, D, \u03b8, EB as in Definition 2.4. Let X, Y be selfadjoint and\nc-free in A over the pair of algebras B, D. We call their (pair) distributions (\u03bcX , \u03bdX )\nand (\u03bcY , \u03bdY ). We shall re-express the c-free convolution of those two in terms of\nthe subordination functions for the second coordinates. We note first that relation\n(15) holds for b of small enough norm. Next, recall that if we require in addition\nthat b is also invertible, then M\u03bc (b) = b\u22121 G\u03bc (b\u22121 ). This holds in general, for distri(n)\nbutions \u03bc \u2208 \u03a3B:D . In such a case, G\u03bcX (b) = (\u03b8 \u2297 1n )[(b \u2212 X)\u22121 ] for b with positive\nimaginary part, or with norm of its inverse small enough.

Second, c R linearizes c-free convolution.

Let\nus also note that B\u03bcX (b\u22121 )b = b \u2212 F\u03bcX (b) = \u2212h\u03bcX (b), so the above can be written\n(however in a less pleasant form) in terms of B.\nFor our purposes (related to the infinite divisibility and the triangular\narrays of identically distributed rows), we note that the n times c-free convolution\nis given as\n(18)\n\nh\u03bcX1 +***+Xn (b) = nh\u03bcX1 (\u03c9n (b)),\n\nwhere \u03c9n is the subordination function with respect to n-fold free additive convolution: G\u03bdX1 +***+Xn (b) = G\u03bdX1 (\u03c9n (b)).\nIn addition to this result, we would like to emphasize the connection of\nc-free independence with Markovianity, as discussed by Voiculescu. Let us recall\nthat \u03bcX : BhX i \u2192 D is given by \u03bcX (P (X )) = \u03b8(P (X)) \u2208 D.

In particular, if D happens to be any von Neumann algebra so that\nB \u2282 D \u2282 BhXi and \u03b8 itself is a conditional expectation, this simply indicates\nthat c-freeness is in fact a different expression of Markovianity, or, differently said,\nc-freeness generalizes the Markov property for free algebras.\nWe conclude this section with a short remark: it follows from (17) with\n\u03bcX = \u03bdX , \u03bcY = \u03bdY that h\u03bdX (\u03c91 (b)) + h\u03bdY (\u03c92 (b)) = h\u03bdX+Y (b), so\n(19)\n\nF\u03bdX+Y (b) = \u03c91 (b) + \u03c92 (b) \u2212 b\n\nb \u2208 H+ (Bnc ).\n\n3. A Hin\u010din type theorem for free additive convolution and the\nrestricted Boolean Bercovici-Pata bijection\nWe shall first prove a restricted version of the Boolean Bercovici-Pata\nbijection, using methods inspired by [3]. There the bijection was conveniently\nexpressed in terms of the subordination function for the power two free additive\nconvolution. We shall obtain the same result here: it follows from the operatorvalued R-transform property (7), Theorem 2.13 and analytic continuation that\nProposition 3.1. For any B-valued distribution \u03bc, we denote \u03c9 the subordination\nfunction for \u03bc \u229e \u03bc. Then the following functional equations hold :\n1\n1\n(20)\n\u03c9(b) = (b + F\u03bc\u229e\u03bc (b)) = (b + F\u03bc (\u03c9(b)),\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n(b + F\u03bc\u229e\u03bc (b)) , b \u2208 H+ (B).\n(21)\nF\u03bc\u229e\u03bc (b) = F\u03bc\n2\n\n\fINFINITE DIVISIBILITY, NON-COMMUTATIVE BERCOVICI-PATA BIJECTION\n\n17\n\nBoth these equations hold for the fully matricial extensions of the functions involved.\nWe prove next a Hin\u010din type theorem.\nTheorem 3.2. Assume that {Xjk }j\u2208N,1\u2264k\u2264kj is a triangular array of random variables in (A, EB , B) of elements free over B so that {Xjk : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 kj } have the same\ndistribution with respect to EB for each j \u2208 N (i.e. rows are identically distributed).\nAssume in addition that\nlim sup kXj1 + * * * + Xjkj k \u2264 M\nj\u2192\u221e\n\nfor some M \u2265 0. If limj\u2192\u221e Xj1 + Xj2 + * * * + Xjkj exists in distribution as normlimit of moments in \u03a3B , then the limit distribution is freely infinitely divisible over\nB.\nRemark/Definition 3.3. We shall call a triangular array of identically distributed\nrows satisfying limj\u2192\u221e kj = \u221e and lim supj\u2192\u221e kXj1 + * * * + Xjkj k \u2264 M for some\nM \u2265 0 infinitesimal. We shall call a triangular array of distributions infinitesimal\nif they can be realized operatorially by an infinitesimal triangular array of random\nvariables. It should be noted that inRscalar-valued probability, being infinitesimal\nmeans that for any \u01eb > 0, limj\u2192\u221e \u03c7[\u2212\u01eb,\u01eb](t) d\u03bcXj1 (t) = 1; thus, we require a\nstronger notion of infinitesimality for our theorem. It should be noted again, however, that when B is finitely dimensional, the above theorem remains true even when\nthe stronger requirement of infinitesimality is removed.\nProof. We first observe that, due to the fact that GX is a noncommutative function\nand the upper half-plane an admissible noncommutative set, it is enough to consider\nin our proof the functions GX . Denote \u03bcj the distribution of X1j , i.e. G\u03bcj =\nEB [(b \u2212 X1j )\u22121 ]. We shall use the subordination result:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\nF\u03bcj (\u03c9j (b)), b \u2208 H+ (B).\nG\u03bcj (\u03c9j (b)) = G \u229ekj (b), \u03c9j (b) = b + 1 \u2212\n\u03bcj\nkj\nkj\nwe observe that \u03c9j is in fact the reciprocal of the Cauchy transform of a positive\nB-valued distribution; indeed, it is clear from (14) that \u03c9j is indeed the reciprocal\n\u22121\n\u229ek\nof the Cauchy transform of (\u03bcj j )\u228e1\u2212kj . Using the characterization in terms of\nR-transform of the free infinite divisibility of Popa and Vinnikov [18, Theorem 5.9],\nas the operator-valued Voiculescu transform of this distribution is simply \u03c6(w) =\n\u22121\n\u229ek\n(kj \u2212 1)(w \u2212 F\u03bcj (w)), w \u2208 H+ (B), it follows that (\u03bcj j )\u228e1\u2212kj is freely infinitely\ndivisible.\nNow our proof is complete: the subordination relation tells us that\nlimj\u2192\u221e \u03c9j (b) = limj\u2192\u221e F \u229ekj (b) norm-uniformly on subsets D \u2282\u2282 H+ (B), so\n\u03bcj\n\n\u22121\n\u229ek\nlimj\u2192\u221e (\u03bcj j )\u228e1\u2212kj\n\n\u229ek\n\n\u229ek\n\n\u22121\n\n= limj\u2192\u221e \u03bcj j . Since, as noted above, (\u03bcj j )\u228e1\u2212kj is freely\ninfinitely divisible and the set of freely infinitely divisible operator-valued distributions is closed under taking norm-moment limits, by Proposition 2.11 we are\ndone.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.4. Consider two infinitesimal triangular arrays {Xjk }j\u2208N,1\u2264k\u2264kj and\n{Yjk }j\u2208N,1\u2264k\u2264kj in (A, EB , B) so that Xjk are all free with amalgamation over B,\nYjk are Boolean independent with amalgamation over B, and {Xjk : 1 \u2264 k \u2264\n\n\f18\n\nS. T. BELINSCHI, M. POPA, AND V. VINNIKOV\n\nkj } \u222a {Yjk : 1 \u2264 k \u2264 kj } have the same distribution with respect to EB for each\nj \u2208 N (i.e. rows are identically distributed). The following are equivalent:\n(a) limj\u2192\u221e Xj1 + Xj2 + * * * + Xjkj exists in distribution (as norm-limit convergence of moments); we call the limit distribution \u03bcX ;\n(b) limj\u2192\u221e Yj1 + Yj2 + * * * + Yjkj exists in distribution (as norm-limit convergence of moments); we call the limit distribution \u03bcY .\nMoreover, the correspondence between the two limiting distributions is given analytically by the fully matricial extension of the relation\n1\n(22)\nF\u03bcX (b) = (b + F\u03bcY (F\u03bcX (b))) b \u2208 H+ (B).\n2\nThe correspondence \u03bcX \u2194 \u03bcY is the Boolean Bercovici-Pata bijection. It\ncan be easily seen to be, as in the case of scalar-valued distributions, a morphism\nbetween \u229e and \u228e.\nProof. Let us assume that limj\u2192\u221e Xj1 +Xj2 +* * *+Xjkj exists. As seen in Theorem\n3.2, \u03bcX is \u229e-infinitely divisible. In terms of the subordination function, this simply\ncorresponds to the limit described in the proof of the previous theorem.\nOn the other hand, if existing, FY (b) \u2212 b = limj\u2192\u221e kj (FYj1 (b) \u2212 b). Since\nwe know that each of kj (b \u2212 FYj1 (b)) is itself a Voiculescu transform of a proba\u228e1\u2212\n\n1\n\n\u229ek +1 \u228e1\u2212\n\n1\n\nkj +1\nkj +1\n= (\u03bcXj1j )\n), it is\nbility measure (namely of (\u03bcXj1 +***+Xjkj +Xjkj +1 )\nenough to show that the inverse of b + kj (FYj1 (b) \u2212 b) with respect to composition\n(which is \u229e-infinitely divisible), converges to FX uniformly on compacts. But this\ninverse is simply \u03c9j from the previous theorem's proof. This completes the proof\nof one implication.\nThe converse is simpler. The statement that Yj1 + * * * + Yjkj tends to Y in\ndistribution as j \u2192 \u221e is equivalent to limj\u2192\u221e kj (FYj1 (b)\u2212b) = FY (b)\u2212b uniformly\non compacts of H+ (B). But then the expression of the Voiculescu transform of the\ndistribution associated with \u03c9j is simply \u03c6j (w) = (kj \u22121)(w\u2212FYj1 (w)), w \u2208 H+ (B).\nSince convergence of Voiculescu transforms and convergence in distribution are\nequivalent, it follows that the distribution associated to \u03c9j converges weakly. Since,\nas seen in the proof of the previous theorem, the distribution associated to \u03c9j is\nsimply the (1 \u2212 kj\u22121 )th Boolean power of the distribution of Xj1 + * * * + Xjkj , it\nfollows that Xj1 + * * * + Xjkj also converges in distribution to the same limit. This\nshows that limj\u2192\u221e Xj1 + * * * + Xjkj exists in distribution and its reciprocal Cauchy\ntransform's formula is the one indicated in (22).\n\u0003\n\nAs a by-product, we obtain the following corollary describing distributions\nwhich are the second power with respect to free additive convolution.\nCorollary 3.5. An operator-valued distribution \u03bc is the nth power with respect to\nfree additive convolution of an operator-valued distribution if and only if \u03bc\u228e1\u22121/n\nis freely infinitely divisible.\nProof. First implication has been noted in the proof of Theorem 3.2, where it is\nnoted that (\u03bd \u229en )\u228e1\u22121/n must be freely infinitely divisible. The converse follows from\n[18]: if \u03bc is freely infinitely divisible, then as \u03bc\u228en/(n\u22121) satisfies F\u03bc\u228en/(n\u22121) (b) =\n1\nn\nn\u22121 F\u03bc (b) \u2212 n\u22121 b, we can use the definition of \u03c6\u03bc to conclude F\u03bc\u228en/(n\u22121) (b +\n1\n\u03c6\u03bc (b). Applying F\u03bc\u22121\n\u03c6\u03bc (b)) = b \u2212 n\u22121\n\u228en/(n\u22121) and using again the definition of\n1\n1\n\u03c6 gives \u03c6\u03bc (b) = \u03c6\u03bc\u228en/(n\u22121) (b \u2212 n\u22121 \u03c6\u03bc (b)) \u2212 n\u22121\n\u03c6\u03bc (b).

C-free Bercovici-Pata bijection\nIn this section we shall connect Boolean, free and conditionally free infinitely divisible distributions both via their Hin\u010din-type description as limits of\ntriangular arrays and via explicit formulas linking their transforms. Our results\nwill generalize the results of the previous section, but we will also use those results\nin our proofs.\nIn some of the statements and proofs made below, we will use the noncommutative set of nilpotent elements of our C\u2217 -algebras and noncommutative\nfunctions defined on it; we are aware that there exist many C\u2217 -algebras that have\nno nilpotent elements except zero, however the fully matricial extensions of those\nelements (as noted in Section 2) are very rich. As we did before, we sometimes\nwrite the proofs using the first coordinate of our noncommutative maps and sets,\nbut we do this only for the relative simplicity of notation: the noncommutative\nstructure allows each proof to be re-written for any coordinate.\nLemma 4.1.

The first assertion is an immediate consequence of Remark 5.5 from [18];\nmore precisely if the components of the R- and c R-transforms of \u03bd and (\u03bc, \u03bd) do\nnot grow faster than exponentially, then so do the moments of \u03bd and \u03bc.\nThe second equation of the second \u0001assertion is simply equation (22); looking at RBP(\u03bd) (b) = \u03b30 * 1 + \u03c3\nf0 (b\u22121 \u2212 \u0001X )\u22121 , Ib < 0, we observe that \u03c6BP(\u03bd) (b) =\n\u22121\nRBP(\u03bd) (b ) = \u03b30 * 1 + \u03c3\nf0 \u0001(b \u2212 X )\u22121 , Ib > 0. We note that if Ib\u22121 is small in\nnorm, then If\n\u03c30 (b \u2212 X )\u22121 is also small in norm; indeed, this has been noted in\nthe proof of Proposition 2.11. Thus, when Ib\u22121 is small enough, b + \u03c6BP (\u03bd) (b) \u2208\nH+ (Bnc ). Using the expression of \u03c6 in terms of F , by replacing b with b + \u03c6BP(\u03bd) (b)\nour equation is equivalent to\n\u0001\n1\nb + \u03c6BP (\u03bd) (b) + F\u03bd (b) ,\nb =\n2\nwhich is trivially equivalent to\n\u0001\n= \u2212\u03c6BP(\u03bd) (b)\n\u03b30 * 1 + \u03c3\nf0 (b \u2212 X )\u22121\n= F\u03bd (b) \u2212 b\n\n= \u2212B\u03bd (b\u22121 )b.\n\nAnalytic continuation concludes the proof of the second equation.\nWe note once again that this second equation together with Proposition\n3.1 indicates that FBP(\u03bd) is in fact simply the subordination function corresponding\nto the free additive convolution of \u03bd with itself: F\u03bd (FBP(\u03bd) (b)) = F\u03bd\u229e\u03bd (b). For the\nfirst equation let us simply rewrite the defining relation (15) for c R expressed in\nterms of \u03b31 and \u03c3\nf1 as\n\u0001\nf1 (FBP(\u03bd) (b) \u2212 X )\u22121 , b \u2208 H+ (Bnc ).\n\u2212h\u03bc\u2032 (b) = b \u2212 F\u03bc\u2032 (b) = \u03b31 * 1 + \u03c3\n\nAs in the definition of the Bercovici-Pata bijection B\u03bc is given by \u03b31 and \u03c3\nf1 , this\nis the claimed relation.\n\u0003\nWe go now to the main result of this section.\n\nTheorem 4.5.

We observe that\nby the previous remark and Theorem 3.4, \u03bd\u229e = BP(\u03bd). As shown in subsection 2.3,\n(\u03bc\n,\u03bd\n) = (\u03bc , \u03bd ) c kn can be expressed coordinatewise\nX1,n +***+Xkn ,n\n\nX1,n +***+Xkn ,n\n\nn\n\nn\n\nin terms of transforms:\n\nh\u03bcX1,n +***+Xk\n\nn ,n\n\n\u03c9n (b) =\n\n1\nkn b\n\n\u0010\n+ 1\u2212\n\n1\nkn\n\n\u0011\n\n(b) = kn h\u03bcX1,n (\u03c9n (b))\n\nF\u03bdX1,n +***+Xk\n\nn ,n\n\n(b) =\n\n1\nkn b\n\nRecall from the proof of Theorem 3.4 that \u03c9n = F\n\n\u0010\n+ 1\u2212\n\n(c-free)\n1\nkn\n\n\u0011\n\n\u22121\n\u228e1\u2212kn\n1,n +***+Xkn ,n\n\n\u03bdX\n\nF\u03bdX1,n (\u03c9n (b))\n\n(free)\n\n\u228e1\u2212k\u22121\n\nn\nand \u03bdX1,n +***+X\nkn ,n\n\nconverges to \u03bd\u229e .\n(1) =\u21d2 (2): Assume first that (1) holds. Then, as seen above, \u03bdn\u229ekn\nn\nconverges to \u03bd\u229e . Since \u03bc\u228ek\nconverges to \u03bc, it was shown in Proposition 2.11 that\nn\nlimn\u2192\u221e kn h\u03bcX1,n (b) = h\u03bc (b) uniformly on closed bounded subsets of the upper\nhalf-plane which are at positive distance from \u2202H+ (B). Thus,\nlim kn * h\u03bcX1,n (\u03c9n (b)) = h\u03bc (F\u03bd\u229e (b)),\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nb \u2208 H+ (B),\n\nand the limit is uniform on closed bounded subsets of the upper half-plane, as shown\nin [9, Theorem 1.10]. Same argument works for the fully matricial extensions, and\nwe conclude that (2) holds.\n(2) =\u21d2 (1): Next, assume that (2) holds. This clearly means that in\nrelation (free) above we can take limits when n tends to infinity to obtain that\n\u228e1\u2212k\u22121\n\nn\nboth \u03bdX1,n +***+X\nand \u03bdX1,n +***+Xkn ,n converge to \u03bd\u229e . So \u03c9n norm-converges\nkn ,n\nto F \u03bd\u229e . We recall that \u03c9n has as right inverse with respect to composition the\nfunction w 7\u2192 kn w + (1 \u2212 kn )F\u03bdX1,n (w), and by Theorem 3.4 and Proposition 2.11\nthis function converges uniformly on closed bounded sets of the upper half-plane\nH+ (Bnc ) to w \u2212 h\u03bd (w). So for Ib sufficiently large in order for b \u2212 h\u03bd (b) to belong\nto H+ (Bnc ) + i1,\n\nlim kn * h\u03bcX1,n (b) =\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n=\n\nlim kn * h\u03bcX1,n (\u03c9n (kn b + (1 \u2212 kn )F\u03bdX1,n (b)))\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nlim h\u03bc (b \u2212 h\u03bd (b))\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nIn the last equality we have used the assumption that kn * h\u03bcX1,n \u25e6 \u03c9n converges to\nh\u03bc uniformly on bounded closed sets of the upper half-plane and that the function\nw 7\u2192 kn w + (1 \u2212 kn )F\u03bdX1,n (w) converges also uniformly to w 7\u2192 w \u2212 h\u03bd (w). Since\nwe assumed b \u2212 h\u03bd (b) \u2208 H+ (Bnc ) + i1, the equality follows. So we have proved (1)\nmust hold. This shows the equivalence between (1) and (2).\n\n\fINFINITE DIVISIBILITY, NON-COMMUTATIVE BERCOVICI-PATA BIJECTION\n\n23\n\nThe previous remark indicates that indeed the limit of (\u03bcn , \u03bdn ) c kn as n\ntends to infinity, if existing, must be BP(\u03bc, \u03bd), thus establishing (2) \u21d4 (3).\nFinally the equivalence of (4) to (1), (2) and (3) is a direct consequence\nof Lemma 4.2, the equivalence between norm-convergence on Nilp and H+ for the\ncorresponding transforms, and the definition of the Bercovici-Pata bijection.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.6. We would like to come back once again to the issue of distributions\nin \u03a3B:D , or even in a larger set. As shown by Bercovici and Voiculescu [5], one can\ndefine free convolutions of probability measures with unbounded support, even when\nthey have no moments whatsoever. In the same paper, they provide an operatorial\nrepresentation, by showing that if A1 , A2 are free in (A, \u03c6), and Xj = Xj\u2217 are unbounded operators affiliated with Aj and having distributions \u03bcXj , j = 1, 2, then\nX1 +X2 is a selfadjoint unbounded operator affiliated to A and \u03bcX1 +X2 = \u03bcX1 \u229e\u03bcX2 .\nIn the case of operator-valued distributions, to our best knowledge such a result does\nnot exist as of now. However, it is very easy to observe that if (A, EB , B) is an\nop-valued noncommutative probability space and X = X \u2217 is affiliated to A, then\n(b \u2212 X)\u22121 \u2208 A for any b \u2208 H+ (B) (one only needs to use analytic functional calculus), so EB [(b\u2212X)\u22121 ] is well-defined. However, except when B is finite dimensional\nand A is a finite von Neumann algebra, we do not know whether any of the results\nof Voiculescu and Speicher (existence and good behavior of R-transform, subordination etc) remains valid. When B is finite dimensional, one can make certain\ngeneralizations (for example one can talk of convergence of distributions in \u03a30B to\na distribution in \u03a3B , or even one without moments - provided we define it appropriately - and even obtain Theorem 3.2 for such a limit when the infinitesimality of\nan array is defined as convergence of GXij to b 7\u2192 b\u22121 ). However, we repeat that\nour purpose in this paper was to provide results in maximum generality in terms of\nB. We shall postpone a detailed discussion of finite dimensional scalar algebras to\nfuture papers.\n5. The homomorphism property of the Bercovici-Pata bijection\nIn this section, we restrict ourselves to the scalar case, i.e. we consider\nB = D = C and in Definition 2.4 EB , \u03b8 to be a pair of states \u03c6, \u03c8 . Also, we will\nuse the complex analytic R-, c R- and B-transforms1, not their non-commutative\nversions.\nFor two pairs of distributions (\u03c6X , \u03c8X ) and (\u03c6Y , \u03c8Y ) given as in Definition\n2.1 by the c-free random variables X and Y , we shall denote \u03c8X \u22a0 \u03c8Y for \u03c6XY and\n(\u03c6X , \u03c8X ) \u22a0c (\u03c6Y , \u03c8Y ) for (\u03c6XY , \u03c8XY ).\nIn terms of transforms, if\nT\u03bd (z) =\n\nz\n,\nR\u22121 (z)\n\nc\n\nT\u03bc,\u03bd (z) =\n\n1 c\nR\u03bc,\u03bd (R\u03bd\u22121 (z))\nR\u03bd\u22121 (z)\n\nit has been shown (see [24], respectively [19]) that\nT\u03bc\u22a0\u03bd (z) = T\u03bc (z)T\u03bd (z)\nT(\u03bc1 ,\u03bd1 )\u22a0c (\u03bc2 ,\u03bd2 ) (z) = c T(\u03bc1 ,\u03bd1 ) (z) * c T(\u03bc2 ,\u03bd2 ) (z).\n\nc\n\n1The reader is warned that in scalar probability, the transform B is denoted by \u03b7, unlike\nin operator-valued probability; we have chosen not to change the notation because we use the\noperator-valued definitions and results already introduced.\n\n\f24\n\nS.
