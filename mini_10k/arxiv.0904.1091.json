Swartz3 and JiFeng\nLiu4\n\nABSTRACT\nWe have studied the X-ray nuclear activity of 187 nearby (distance < 15 Mpc) galaxies\nobserved with Chandra/ACIS. We found that 86 of them have a point-like X-ray core, consistent\nwith an accreting BH. We argue that the majority of them are nuclear BHs, rather than X-ray\nbinaries. The fraction of galaxies with an X-ray detected nuclear BH is higher (\u2248 60 per cent)\nfor ellipticals and early-type spirals (E to Sb), and lower (\u2248 30 per cent) for late-type spirals (Sc\nto Sm). There is no preferential association of X-ray cores with the presence of a large-scale bar;\nin fact, strongly barred galaxies appear to have slighly lower detection fraction and luminosity\nfor their nuclear X-ray sources, compared with non-barred or weakly barred galaxies of similar\nHubble types. The cumulative luminosiy distribution of the nuclear sources in the 0.3\u20138 keV band\nis a power-law with slope \u2248 \u22120.5, from \u2248 2 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 to \u2248 1042 erg s\u22121 . The Eddington ratio\nis lower for ellipticals (LX /LEdd \u223c 10\u22128 ) and higher for late-type spirals (up to LX /LEdd \u223c 10\u22124 ),\nbut in all cases, the accretion rate is low enough to be in the radiatively-inefficient regime. The\nintrinsic absorbing column density is generally low, especially for the less luminous sources: there\nappear to be no Type-2 nuclear BHs at luminosities . 1039 erg s\u22121 . The lack of a dusty torus or\nof other sources of intrinsic absorption (e.g., an optically-thick disk wind) may be directly related\nto the lack of a standard accretion disk around those faint nuclear BHs. The fraction of obscured\nsources increases with the nuclear BH luminosity: two thirds of the sources with LX > 1040 erg\ns\u22121 have a fitted column density > 1022 cm\u22122 . This is contrary to the declining trend of the\nobscured fraction with increasing luminosities, observed in more luminous AGN and quasars.\nSubject headings: X-rays: galaxies-galaxies: nuclei-galaxies: statistics-galaxies: active\n\n1.\n\n2006). But in some low-mass galaxies, nuclear\nBHs have also been identified (Seth et al. 2008;\nFilippenko & Ho 2003; J\u0131\u0301menez-Bail\u00f3n et al. 2005;\nGreene & Ho 2004, 2007; Dong et al. 2007; Greene et al.\n2008). Thus, it is still a topic of active investigation whether there is a mass threshold between\nspiral galaxies containing a nuclear BH or a nuclear star cluster, to what extent they coexist,\nand what the mass relation is between the two\nnuclear systems when they are both present. It\nis also still debated whether there is a Hubbletype threshold for the presence of a nuclear BH,\nthat is whether late-type spiral galaxies without a\nspheroidal component can have nuclear BHs, and\nif so, whether the BH formation mechanisms and\ngrowth processes are different from those of nuclear BHs in massive spheroidals (Seth et al. 2008;\nWang & Kauffmann 2008).\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSupermassive black holes (BHs) are now believed to exist in all massive galaxies with a\nspheroidal component (Magorrian et al. 1998;\nMerritt & Ferrarese 2001b; Kormendy 2004).\nLow-mass galaxies tend to harbour a nuclear\nstar cluster, whose mass is also related to the\nmass of the spheroidal component (Ferrarese et al.\n1 Physics Department and Center for Astrophysics, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China; email: zhangweiming@mails.thu.edu.cn.\n2 MSSL, University College London, Holmbury House,\nDorking RH5 6NT, UK.\n3 Universities Space Research Association, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, VP62, Huntsville, AL, USA.\n4 Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden st., Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.\n\n1\n\n\fThe main difficulty in resolving these questions\nis determining which galaxies host nuclear BHs.\nIn particular, kinematic mass determinations require prohibitively high spatial resolution at the\nlow-mass end. When a kinematic mass determination of the central dark mass is not available (i.e., in all but a few cases), the strongest\nevidence of the presence of a nuclear BH comes\nfrom its accretion-powered activity (Salpeter 1964;\nLynden-Bell 1969). AGN activity can be identified\neither from an emission-line optical/UV spectrum\nfrom the nuclear region, or from a point-like X-ray\nnuclear source, or from a flat-spectrum radio core;\nsurveys in different bands lead to different selection biases. Statistical studies of the AGN population provide direct information on what fraction\nand what types of galaxies contain a nuclear BH,\nand indirect constraints on their masses and accretion rates.\nOptical spectroscopic studies such as the Palomar Survey (Ho et al. 1997a,b) and the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (Hao et al. 2005a) suggest\n(Ho 2008) that \u2248 10% of nearby galaxies are\nSeyferts, \u2248 20% are \"pure\" Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Regions (LINERs), and another \u2248 10% are \"transition objects\" whose spectra are intermediate between those of pure LINERs and HII regions (Heckman 1980). This means\nthat overall, at least 4/10 of nearby galaxies contain a currently active nuclear BH. This is only a\nlower limit to the population of currently active\nnuclear BHs: another 40% of galaxies have an\nemission-line nucleus (HII nucleus). HII nuclei are\npowered by a compact star-forming region, but in\nsome cases they may also harbour a weakly accreting BH. Optical surveys also show that Seyferts,\nLINERs and transition objects are mostly found\nin early-type galaxies: \u2248 60% of E to Sb galaxies\nhave such nuclear signatures; conversely, almost\nall late-type disk galaxies are dominated by HII\nnuclei, and . 20% of them have evidence of an\naccreting nuclear BH (Ho 2008). Thus, it is more\ndifficult to obtain reliable BH demographics in\nlate-type galaxies (containing smaller BHs) using optical spectroscopy, due to confusion from\nstar formation. Spitzer's mid-infrared spectroscopic studies (Satyapal et al. 2008) have recently\nproved more effective at finding nuclear BHs in\nlate-type galaxies, with an AGN detection rate\npossibly 4 times larger than suggested by optical\n\nspectroscopic observations.\nRadio-band surveys are not yet as complete\nor as sensitive as the Palomar or Sloan optical surveys.\nNonetheless, arcsec-resolution\nVLA surveys at 5 GHz (Wrobel & Heeschen\n1991), 8.4 GHz (Nagar et al. 2005) and 15 GHz\n(Filho, Barthel & Ho 2006) have confirmed the\npresence of AGN signatures (non-thermal radio\ncores) in \u2248 30\u201340% of early-type galaxies, mostly\nSeyferts and LINERs. The radio emission in LINERs is mainly confined to a compact core or the\nbase of a jet (sub-arcsec size); Seyferts are more\noften accompanied by extended (arcsec-size) jetlike features (Nagar et al. 2005). Somewhat in\ncontrast with the optical classification, radio detections of compact cores in transition objects are\nmuch rarer; this suggests that perhaps \u2248 50% of\ntransition objects are not AGN.\nX-ray surveys are an under-utilized and very\npromising tool to further our understanding of\nlow-level nuclear activity in the local Universe.\nX-ray emission probes regions much closer to the\naccreting BH than, for example, optical emission\nlines. And a direct study of the nuclear X-ray\nsource allows better constraints on its mass accretion rate and output power, stripped of the often\nmessy or ambiguous optical-line phenomenology of\nthe host galaxy. Sub-arcsec spatial resolution and\nastrometric accuracy are required for the study\nof low-luminosity AGN, for at least two reasons:\nto confirm that an X-ray source is point-like and\ncoincident with the optical/radio nucleus; and to\nseparate the point-like, nuclear X-ray source from\nthe surrounding unresolved emission (mostly from\ndiffuse hot gas and faint X-ray binaries), which is\noften present in galactic cores. Only Chandra can\nprovide such resolution and astrometric accuracy.\nThere are still no complete, unbiased Chandra Xray surveys of galaxies in the local universe, mostly\nbecause time-allocation constraints lead to an implicit bias towards X-ray luminous targets. However, a number of Chandra studies have targeted\na sizeable fraction of nearby LINERs (about half\nof the LINERs in the Palomar survey; Ho (2008)).\nThey have confirmed that most LINERs and transition objects contain an X-ray luminous, accreting BH (Satyapal et al. 2004; Dudik et al. 2005;\nPellegrini 2005; Satyapal et al. 2005; Flohic et al.\n2006; Gonz\u00e1lez-Mart\u0131\u0301n et al. 2006). More specifically, \u2248 75% of LINERs have an X-ray nucleus,\n2\n\n\fand this fraction goes to 100% for the subsample of\nLINERs that also have a detected radio core (Ho\n(2008) and references therein). In such Chandra\nstudies, the typical detection limit for point-like\nnuclear X-ray sources is \u223c 1038 erg s\u22121 . This is directly comparable to the detection limit of nuclear\nH\u03b1 emission in the Palomar survey, \u223c 1037 erg\ns\u22121 , because, in typical Seyferts, LX \u223c 10LH\u03b1 (Ho\n2008). For such low-luminosity AGN, radio and Xray studies are in principle less affected by contamination from possible surrounding star-forming regions than studies based on photoionized H\u03b1 emission. It is still not known whether or what fraction\nof HII nuclei in late-type spirals also have an Xray active nuclear BH, and whether there is any\ncorrelation with the presence and strength of a\nlarge-scale bar. Pioneering studies (Ghosh et al.\n2008; Desroches & Ho 2009) suggest that a few\nnearby late-type spirals with an optically-classified\nHII nucleus may harbour a low-luminosity AGN\nwith LX \u2248 a few 1037 erg s\u22121 . The drawback of\nX-ray studies is that at such low luminosities, it\nbecomes extremely difficult to determine for any\nindividual galaxy whether the nuclear source is the\naccreting supermassive BH or an unrelated X-ray\nbinary in the dense nuclear region or in a nuclear\nstar cluster.\nX-ray surveys, in combination with other\nbands, can do more than just refine our statistical census of active nuclei across the Hubble sequence: they can be used to obtain a\nphysical understanding of the process of accretion across the whole range of mass accretion\nrates. A fundamental issue that deserves investigation is whether there is a continuous distribution of nuclear X-ray activity from the most\nluminous quasars (Lbol \u223c LEdd) to run-of-themill Seyferts (Lbol \u223c (10\u22124 \u201310\u22122)LEdd ), LINERs (Lbol \u223c (10\u22126 \u201310\u22124 )LEdd ) transition objects\n(Lbol \u223c (10\u22127 \u201310\u22126 )LEdd ) all the way down to\n\"quiescent\" galactic nuclei such as the BH in\nthe Milky Way or in nearby elliptical galaxies\n(Lbol . 10\u22129 LEdd ); or, instead, whether there is a\nseries of clear thresholds along this sequence, corresponding to fundamental changes in the accretion mode and inflow structure. Such transitions\nmay or may not coincide with the \"canonical\"\naccretion states found in stellar-mass BHs. Moreover, thresholds in the X-ray properties may or\nmay not coincide with optically-classified classes\n\nof AGN.\nOne such physical transition may be between\naccreting BHs with and without an optically-thick\naccretion disk. The presence or absence of disk signatures such as Compton reflection and a broad Fe\nline in the X-ray spectra can provide strong constraints, in parallel with the presence or absence\nof a UV bump in the spectral energy distribution.\nIt was suggested (Ho 2008) that the disappearance of the inner disk marks the transition between Seyferts and LINERs. A related issue yet to\nbe properly understood in low-luminosity AGN is\nthe redistribution of the accretion power between\na radiative component (UV/X-rays), a mechanical\ncomponent (radio jets) and an advected component; AGN become radio louder at lower accretion\nrates, in agreement with the trend seen in Galactic\nBHs (Fender, Belloni & Gallo 2004; Merloni et al.\n2003). Order-of-magnitude estimates of the accretion rate based on the mass-loss rate from evolved\nstars and the gravitational capture rate of hot\ngas from the interstellar medium typically lead to\nlarge overestimates of the nuclear BH luminosity,\nespecially in LINERs and transition objects (Ho\n2008). Therefore, such objects are an ideal test\nfor radiatively inefficient accretion models such as\nAdvection-Dominated Accretion Flows (ADAF)\nor Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flows (RIAF)\n(Narayan & Yi 1995; Quataert & Narayan 1999;\nNarayan 2002; Yuan & Narayan 2004). X-ray\nstudies also allow quantitative comparisons between the amount of gas that is used for star formation in the nuclear region of late-type spirals,\nand that used for fuelling a possible accreting BH\n(or an upper limit to that accretion rate), and how\nthis ratio depends on Hubble type and bar structure.\nAnother physical problem that can be addressed with X-ray surveys is the validity of the\nunified model (Antonucci 1993) at low accretion\nrates and low luminosities (LX \u223c 1038 \u20131041 erg\ns\u22121 ). The standard unified model is based on the\npresence of a geometrically and optically thick\nparsec-scale structure (\"dusty torus\") that blocks\nour direct view of the innermost disk in highinclination sources (Type-2 AGN). The nature and\nphysical structure of the obscuring material is still\ncontroversial. In alternative to the parsec-scale\ntorus scenario, it was suggested that the absorption could instead be due to an optically-thick disk\n3\n\n\fwind, launched from a few 100 Schwarzschild radii\n(Elvis 2000; Elvis et al. 2004; Murray et al. 1995;\nMurray & Chiang 1998). X-ray spectral surveys\nof low-luminosity AGN are crucial to determine\nwhether the thick absorber disappears along with\nthe disk signatures (which would point to an intimate connection between the two components),\nand at what luminosities. We already know that\nthere are no dusty tori around extremely faint\nBHs such as the one in our Galaxy. Chandra and\nXMM-Newton studies show low absorbing column\ndensities and weak or undetected narrow Fe K\u03b1\nemission in a large fraction of nearby LINERs,\nwhich suggests a direct, unobstructed view of the\nnucleus (Ho 2008). In contrast, strong Fe K\u03b1 emission (Cappi et al. 2006) and a nearly continuous\ndistribution of absorbing columns (Panessa et al.\n2006) suggest that Seyferts are more gas-rich than\nLINERs.\nTo address those issues, we have collected and\nanalyzed the archival Chandra data available for\nnearby galaxies (see Section 2 for the selection criteria of our sample). In this paper, we present\npreliminary results of our X-ray population study,\nfocussing in particular on the luminosity distribution and on the dependence of the absorbing\ncolumn density on the nuclear luminosity.\n2.\n\nNGC 1493\nClass I\n\nNGC 2841\nClass II\n\n0.8 kpc\n15 arcsec\n\n0.9 kpc\n15 arcsec\nNGC 1156\nClass IV\n\nNGC 3351\nClass III\n\n0.6 kpc\n15 arcsec\n\n0.5 kpc\n15 arcsec\n\nFig. 1.- Our X-ray classification of the nuclear\nregions (see also Table 1), based on the Chandra/ACIS images: I = dominant point-like X-ray\nnucleus; II = point-like nuclear source embedded\nin diffuse or unresolved emission (from hot gas and\nfainter X-ray binaries); III = diffuse X-ray emission without a clearly-idenfied point-like core; IV\n= no detectable X-ray emission at the nuclear position.\nwith photographic magnitude mp < 14.5 mag,\nand in the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS)\ncatalogs (Fullmer & Londsdale 1989; Moshir et al.\n1993) with a flux fFIR \u2265 10\u221210.3 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ,\nwhere fFIR /10\u221211 = 3.25S60 + 1.26S100 erg cm\u22122\ns\u22121 (Rice et al. 1988).

The UGC contains all galaxies north of\nB1950 \u03b4 = \u22122\u25e6 30\u2032 . This combined selection criteria favor nearby, predominantly optically-bright\ngalaxies with at least a modest amount of recent star formation. The sample is known to exclude smaller dwarf galaxies in the neighborhood\n(Swartz et al. 2008). Most ellipticals would be included by the selection criteria; however, there are\nnot many Northern-hemisphere nearby ellipticals\n(this bias is further discussed in Swartz et al. 2009,\nin prep.). There are 140 galaxies in this complete\nsample. However, only 116 have been observed\nwith Chandra; the rest only have XMM-Newton\n\nSAMPLE SELECTION\n\nIn general, we have two choices when selecting\na sample of nearby galaxies for X-ray population\nstudies of their nuclei. We can select all targets\nobserved by Chandra within a certain distance or\nflux detection limit; this sample will probably be\nbiased in favour of X-ray luminous galaxies (or\ngalaxies with starbursts, or with some other X-ray\npeculiarities), which are more likely to be selected\nas targets. Alternatively, we may select a limited\nsub-sample of such targets, which may be regarded\nas complete (or at least unbiased) according to\nsome optical criteria.\nFor our work, we have started from an optically/IR selected sample previously used by\nSwartz et al. (2008) and Swartz et al. (2009, in\nprep.) for a statistical X-ray study of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) population. This sample is defined as a volume-limited set of galaxies\nwithin 14.5 Mpc that are both contained in the\nUppsala Galaxy Catalog (UGC; Nilson (1973))\n\n4\n\n\f(S0 through Sb); 36% late-type spirals (Sc through\nSm); 13% dwarfs/irregulars. The optical line classification is: 8% Seyfert; 11% LINERs; 10% transition objects; 40% HII nuclei; 31% unknown. For\nsimplicity, we will call this sample of 187 galaxies\nthe \"extended sample\".\n\nand ROSAT data, which are less suitable for our\nstudy due to their larger point-spread-functions.\nNonetheless, we estimate that the bias introduced\nby the lack of Chandra coverage for those 24 galaxies out of 140 is minimal. Henceforth, we will refer\nto this subsample of 116 galaxies as the optical/IR\nsample, for simplicity. The morphological classification of those 116 galaxies is: 3% ellipticals; 44%\nearly-type spirals (S0 through Sb); 42% late-type\nspirals (Sc through Sm); 11% dwarfs/irregulars.\nThe optical line classification is: 9% Seyfert; 11%\nLINERs; 11% transition objects; 29% HII nuclei;\n40% unknown.\nWe have then used a larger sample, defined\nby Liu (2009, in prep.): it includes all Chandra/ACIS targets within 15 Mpc, contained in\nthe Third Reference Catalog of Galaxies (RC3;\nde Vaucouleurs et al. 1991), which is complete for\nnearby galaxies having apparent diameters \u2265 1\u2032 at\nthe D25 isophotal level and total B-band magnitudes mB < 15.5 mag, in both the Northern\nand Southern sky. We have taken all the Chandra/ACIS targets within this sample (as of the end\nof 2007); the exposure times range from 500 s to\n120 ks. This selection adds another 71 galaxies\nto those already contained in the optical/IR sample. The Liu sample is slightly biased in favour\nof the brighter and larger galaxies, as expected;\nit is essentially an X-ray selected sample, because\nonly \u223c 10 per cent of the RC3 galaxies have been\nChandra targets. From the morphological point\nof view, the Liu sample has an overabundance\nof early-type spirals, which somewhat compensates the bias of the optical/IR sample in favour\nof late-type galaxies; moreover, it includes a few\nSouthern-hemisphere ellipticals, lacking from the\noptical/IR sample.\nIn summary, there are altogether 187 nearby\ngalaxies with publicly-available Chandra observations (as of December 2007) included either in\nthe optically/IR-selected sample or in the X-rayselected sample, within 15 Mpc (full list in Table 1)1 . More than half (104/187) of those galaxies are also included in the optical Palomar sample. The morphological classification of those 187\ngalaxies is: 8% ellipticals; 43% early-type spirals\n\n3.\n\nDATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS\n\nFor each of the 187 Chandra target galaxies\nin our extended sample, we searched for a pointlike X-ray source at or close to the nuclear position. For the nuclear coordinates, we generally\nreferred to the positions listed in the NASA/IPAC\nExtragalactic Database (NED2 ). In most cases,\nthey come from the Two Micron All Sky Survey\n(2MASS) catalog (Skrutskie et al. 2006); the semimajor axes of the 95% confidence ellipse vary between \u2248 1.\u2032\u2032 0 and 1.\u2032\u2032 5. In a few cases, the NED\npositions come from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nData Release 63 (semi-major axes \u2248 0.\u2032\u2032 5), or from\nVLA radio observations (for example in the case\nof NGC 4203, with semi-major axes \u2248 0.\u2032\u2032 1).\nWe used the Chandra Interactive Analysis of\nObservations software (CIAO) V4.1 for filtering\nand analyzing the event files. For each Chandra\nobservation, we checked and screened out exposure intervals corresponding to background flares.\nWe used the standard task wavdetect to identify\nsources in the nuclear region of each galaxy. The\nmorphologies of the nuclear regions in the Chandra images can be loosely grouped into four classes\n(Figure 1): (I) a dominant nuclear source; (II) a\nnuclear source embedded in extended, unresolved\nemission; (III) unresolved emission in the nuclear\nregion but no point-like source; (IV) no nuclear\nsource at all4 . Eighty-six of the 187 galaxies\nin our sample belong to class I and II, that is\nhave a point-like X-ray source within 1\u2032\u2032 of the\nindependently-identified nuclear position (details\nin Section 3.1). For all the nuclear sources, we extracted spectra (in the 0.3\u20138 keV band) from circular regions of radius 1.\u2032\u2032 5 (which include \u2248 90%\nof the counts), and corresponding background and\nresponse files using the CIAO task psextract. We\nused XSPEC Version 12.1 (Arnaud 1996) for spec2 http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/\n\n1 We\n\nexcluded M 31-Andromeda from the sample. Its nuclear BH has a 0.3\u20138 keV luminosity \u2248 1036 erg s\u22121\n(Garcia et al. 2005); this would be below the detection limit\nfor all other galaxies in our sample.\n\n3 http://www.sdss.org/dr6\n4 This\n\nclassification is reminiscent of, but not identical to the\nX-ray morphological classification in Ho et al. (2001).\n\n5\n\n\ftral modelling. We used the Cash statistics (Cash\n1979) for sources with . 200 counts, and the \u03c72\nstatistics (with suitably binned data) in the other\ncases. In addition, some galaxies have been the\ntarget of detailed Chandra studies in the literature: in those cases, we have used their spectral\nresults to complement our analysis.\n3.1.\n\ndetected in the X-ray band is that optical emission\nlines from the nuclear BH may be more severely\nobscured by dust in the surrounding star-forming\nenvironment.\nWe then searched for possible correlations between the presence of a nuclear X-ray source and\nof a large-scale bar. In the optical/IR sample, Xray cores are found in \u2248 60 per cent of non-barred\n(SA) galaxies (21 out of 34) and weakly barred\n(SAB) galaxies (16 out of 27), and in \u2248 20 per cent\nof strongly barred (SB) galaxies (6 out of 26). For\nthe extended sample, nuclear sources are detected\nin \u2248 60 per cent (30 out of 48) of SA, \u2248 60 per\ncent (24 out of 41) of SAB and \u2248 40 per cent (16\nout of 42) of SB galaxies. Part of this effect is due\nto the larger presence of early-type spirals among\nthe SA and SAB classes. To remove this bias, we\ncompared the effect of a bar separately within the\nearly-type and late-type spiral subsamples (Table\n3). We still find a slightly higher fraction of active\nnuclei in the SA/SAB classes compared with the\nSB class. In early-type spirals, \u2248 70 per cent of\nnon-barred/weakly-barred galaxies have an active\nnucleus, compared with about half for stronglybarred galaxies; in late-type spirals, about half of\nnon-barred/weakly-barred galaxies have an X-ray\ncore, but only about 1/4 of strongly-barred galaxies. This confirms that bar structures have no\npositive influence on nuclear BH feeding (Ho et al.\n1997d; Sakamoto et al. 1999). If anything, there\nmay be a slight anticorrelation (see also Section 4),\nbut it may be still be attributed to small number\nstatistics.\n\nCensus of nuclear X-ray sources\n\nFor the optical/IR sample, \u2248 50 per cent (27\nout of 53) of early-type galaxies (Hubble types E\nto Sb) have a point-like nuclear X-ray core (Table\n2). By contrast, this proportion drops to \u2248 30 per\ncent (20 out of 63) for later Hubble types (Sc to Sm\nand Irr). Most Seyferts (7 out of 9) and LINERs\n(12 out of 13) have a detected X-ray nucleus; this\nproportion drops to less than half for transition\nobjects (5 out of 12) and HII nuclei (16 out of 46).\nFor the extended sample, \u2248 60 per cent (57 out\nof 94) of early type galaxies have an X-ray nucleus,\nbut only \u2248 30 per cent (29 out of 93) of later Hubble types. More than 90 per cent (33 out of 36) of\nSeyferts and LINERs are X-ray detected, while an\nX-ray core is found in \u2248 60 per cent of transition\nobjects (12 out of 20) and \u2248 30 per cent of HII\nnuclei (18 out of 54). Thus, the optical/IR sample\nand the extended sample are consistent with each\nother.\nThe numbers above are roughly consistent with\nthe AGN fraction inferred from optical spectroscopic studies (Ho 2008) in early-type (\u2248 50\u201370\nper cent) and late-type (\u2248 15 per cent) galaxies\nrespectively. There is a slight overabundance of Xray core detections in late-type spirals compared\nwith the optical AGN fraction in the Palomar sample, and with the estimates of Hao et al. (2005b)\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (based on H\u03b1\nand [OIII] emission lines). This might be due to\ncontamination from high-mass X-ray binaries, but\nwe do not think this is a very significant effect (see\nSection 3.3). It is more likely due to the negligible effect, through heating and photo-ionization,\nthat a faint X-ray core (LX \u223c 1038 erg s\u22121 ) would\nhave on the optical/UV nuclear spectrum; as a result, it may not appear as an active nucleus in the\nPalomar sample. See also Hopkins et al. (2009)\nfor a discussion of how optical surveys may miss\nlow-luminosity AGN, or erroneously classify them\nas optically-obscured, because of dilution effects.\nAnother reason why nuclear activity is more often\n\n3.2.\n\nSpectral modelling and luminosity\ndistribution\n\nThere are about 15 sources with \u2248 4\u201310 net\ncounts: these are significant detections because\nthe expected positions are independently known,\nthe background level is very low, and there are\nno other point-like sources nearby. We used the\nBayesian method of Kraft et al. (1991) to confirm the significance of those detections. For\nsources with such a low number of counts, we fitted their spectra with a simple power-law model\nwith fixed galactic absorption (no intrinsic absorption). For other sources with more counts,\nwe used an absorbed power-law model with free\nintrinsic column density NH . A power-law with\ncold absorption generally provides a good fit for\n6\n\n\f30\n\n50\n\n25\n\n40\n\n20\nN\n\nN\n\n30\n15\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\u0393\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n0\n0\n\n4\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\u0393\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nFig. 2.- Left panel: photon index distribution for the nuclear X-ray sources in the optically/IR-selected\nsample of galaxies. Right panel: photon index distribution for the extended (X-ray selected) sample.\nmost of the sources. However, about 20 nuclear\nsources clearly require an additional ionized absorber and/or an optically-thin thermal-plasma\nemission component, which we have included in\nour spectral fits. Figure 2 shows the distribution\nof the fitted photon indices for the optical/IR sample and the extended sample. Most of the nuclear\nsources have a photon index \u2248 1.5\u20132.0, which is\nthe typical range for AGN. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the intrinsic NH for the two samples\n(which are once again consistent with each other).\nIt is clear that most nuclear sources are not heavily obscured: very few of them can be classified as\nType-2, in the unified scheme (see Section 3.4).\nWe then used the fitted values of photon index and absorption to estimate the intrinsic 0.3\u20138\nkeV isotropic luminosities of all 86 nuclear sources\nin the extended sample (Table 4 and Figure 4).\nThe cumulative luminosity distribution is consistent with a power-law with a slope of \u2248 \u22120.45\nabove \u2248 2 \u00d7 1038 ergs s\u22121 , which we estimate\nas the completeness limit, based on the exposure\ntimes and detection thresholds for the shortest observations in our sample. Because of the different\nexposure times and distances of our galaxies, in\naddition to non-constant background levels in the\nnuclear regions, it is not meaningful to give a detection threshold for the whole sample.\n\n3.3.\n\nPhysical identification of the nuclear\nX-ray source population\n\nThe main problem affecting X-ray surveys of\nlow-luminosity (LX . 1039 erg s\u22121 ) nuclear BH activity is the possibility of confusion with X-ray binaries, in the overlapping range of luminosities. A\ntypical example is the nuclear X-ray source in M 33\n(Gebhardt et al. 2001; Dubus, Charles & Long\n2004). Detailed investigations of individual galactic nuclei (Ghosh et al. 2008) have highlighted\nthe difficulties and ambiguities of any such identifications. On a statistical basis, the slope and\nnormalization of the cumulative luminosity distribution in our extended sample (Figure 4) is\nalso consistent with the luminosity distribution\nof a population of high-mass X-ray binaries, in a\ngalaxy or ensemble of galaxies with a total star\nformation rate of \u2248 25M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Grimm et al.\n2003, Eq. 5), for which we would also expect an\nintegrated H\u03b1 luminosity LH\u03b1 \u2248 3 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 .\nThis could be a priori consistent with our sample,\nif the majority of our 187 galaxies were in the\nhigh-luminosity tail of the HII nuclei distribution\n(Ho et al. 1997c). However, there are a few arguments in support of a nuclear BH identification\nfor the majority of our 86 nuclear X-ray sources.\nFirstly, we limited our sample to X-ray sources\nlocated within 1\u2032\u2032 (typically, \u2248 30\u201370 pc for the\nmajority of our galaxies) of the independently\nknown nuclear position.

Right panel:\nintrinsic NH distribution for the extended sample.\nannulus between 1\u2032\u2032 and 5\u2032\u2032 around the nuclear position (a projected area 24 times larger), we found\nonly \u2248 50 sources, identified with the same criteria used for the 86 nuclear sources. Such a concentration of point-like X-ray sources exactly at the\nnucleus but not in its immediate surroundings is\nmuch cuspier than typical projected stellar densities (except when the galaxy has a nuclear star\nclusters) or densities of star formation rate. And\nthe argument is even stronger if we consider that\nhigh-mass X-ray binaries may easily disperse over\n& 100 pc in their lifetime, owing to proper motion:\nthus, it would be even more unlikely to find most\nof them exactly at the nuclear position.\nSecondly, our cumulative luminosity distribution is consistent with an unbroken power-law up\nto \u223c 1042 erg s\u22121 , where we run out of galaxies\nin our sample (Figure 4). Instead, the luminosity\ndistribution of high-mass X-ray binaries (including\nultraluminous X-ray sources) shows a downturn at\n\u2248 1040 erg s\u22121 (Grimm et al. 2003; Swartz et al.\n2004). A scenario where our nuclear-source population is composed of low-luminosity AGN for\nLX & 1040 erg s\u22121 and high-mass X-ray binaries\nfor LX . 1040 erg s\u22121 , coincidentally with the\nsame normalization, appears highly contrived.\nThirdly, the majority of the nuclear sources (57\nout of 86) are detected in the earlier-type galaxies of our sample (E to Sb), that is in galaxies where the nuclear region is part of a mas-\n\n2\n\nN (>L)\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n36\n\n10\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\n41\n\n42\n\n43\n\n10 10 10 10 10 10 10\n0.3\u22128 keV luminosity (ergs s\u22121)\n\n44\n\n10\n\nFig. 4.- Cumulative luminosity distribution (0.3\u2013\n8 keV band) for all the 86 nuclear X-ray sources\nin our extended sample. The completeness limit\n(estimated from the shortest exposure times in the\nsurvey) is \u2248 2 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 . A power-law fit has\na slope d log N/d log LX \u2248 \u22120.5.\n\n8\n\n\fsive, old spheroidal component (Section 3.1). If\nthe contamination from high-mass X-ray binaries\nwere significant, we would expect to find more\nsources in late-type spirals. Ellipticals and massive spheroidals do have a high stellar density in\ntheir cores, with old populations, so they may\nhave low-mass X-ray binaries near the nuclear position. But a significant contribution of low-mass\nX-ray binaries to our source population above\n2 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 is also ruled out, because their\ncumulative luminosity distribution would be much\nsteeper (Gilfanov 2004; Swartz et al. 2004). In\naddition, we used the following argument to estimate the possible contribution of low-mass Xray binaries in the nuclear region of ellipticals and\nspheroidal bulges. From surface brightness profiles (Gebhardt et al. 2003; Lauer et al. 1995), we\ncan estimate the total luminosity and hence the\ntotal stellar mass of characteristic galaxy types\nwithin, say, 1.\u2032\u2032 5 (\u223c 50\u2013100 pc for our distance\nrange), that is, the radius of our source extraction region around each nuclear position. This is\nof course a function of Hubble type and galaxy\nhistory, among other things, but M \u223c 108 M\u2299 is\nan order-of-magnitude estimate for massive ellipticals, and a conservative upper limit for spheroidal\nbulges. From the population studies of Gilfanov\n(2004), we expect \u223c 0.02 sources with X-ray luminosities & 2\u00d71038 erg s\u22121 , from an old stellar population with a stellar mass \u223c 108 M\u2299 . A similar\nestimate can be obtained directly from the growth\ncurves plotted in Fig. 3 of Gilfanov (2004) for a\nsample of nearby elliptical galaxies and spheroidal\nbulges: those plots also suggest the presence of\n. 0.1 sources above 1038 erg s\u22121 within 1.\u2032\u2032 5, scaled\nto the range of distances of our sample. Since our\nmain statistical results are based on sources above\na completeness limit \u2248 2 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 , the contamination of at most 2 or 3 X-ray binaries in our\nwhole sample of early-type galaxies is not a significant problem.\nTaken together, the previous arguments strongly\nsupport our identification of the X-ray source population as active nuclear BHs-without ruling out\nthe possibility of stellar-mass interlopers in some\nlimited cases, such as M 33, where stellar kinematics suggest a BH mass < 1500M\u2299 (Gebhardt et al.\n2001). The distribution of X-ray photon indices\n\u2248 1.5\u20132.0 is also in the typical range for AGN,\nand rules out, for example, thermal emission from\n\ncompact starburst nuclei.\n\n42\n\nLX/LH\u03b1 = 25\n5\n\n40\n\n0.08\n\n38\n\nlog LX (erg s\u22121)\n\n1\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n40\nlog LH\u03b1 (erg s\u22121)\n\n41\n\nFig. 5.- Correlation between H\u03b1 luminosity and\nX-ray luminosity (0.3\u20138 keV) from the nuclei with\npoint-like X-ray emission.

After\nall, many of our sample galaxies are classified as\nHII nuclei. This scenario is already implausible\ngiven the predominant detection of X-ray cores\nin earlier-type galaxies, as noted earlier. But we\ncan test this possibility more quantitatively by\ncomparing the nuclear X-ray and H\u03b1 luminosities.\nFifty-three of the 86 galaxies with an X-ray core in\nour sample are also included in the optical spectroscopic Palomar survey of Ho et al. (1997a), which\nprovides nuclear H\u03b1 fluxes. Both the H\u03b1 and the\n0.3\u20138 keV luminosities of a star-forming region are\nproportional to the current or recent star formation rate (assuming that it has stayed approximately constant over the last \u223c 10 Myr): LH\u03b1 \u2248\n1.3 \u00d7 1041 SFR(M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) erg s\u22121 (Kennicutt\n1998), and L0.3\u22128 \u2248 1.0 \u00d7 1040 SFR(M\u2299 yr\u22121 )\nerg s\u22121 (Grimm et al. 2003). Thus, we expect\nL0.3\u22128 \u223c 0.1LH\u03b1 for a starburst-dominated compact nucleus.

The output distribution is still uniform and uncorrelated, unlike the observed distribution of the\nreal sources.\nthe observed trend, we need to check that it is\nnot the result of observational bias. We have\nalready excluded from the absorption\u2013luminosity\nplot (Figure 6) all sources detected with \u2264 10\ncounts. One possibility might be that we lose all\nsources with NH & 1022 cm\u22122 and LX . 1039 erg\ns\u22121 because they would not have enough counts to\nbe detected. However, using simulated X-ray data\nand spectral models, we verified that this is not the\ncase: even for NH \u2248 1023 cm\u22122 , most sources with\na typical photon index \u0393 \u2248 1.7 and LX \u2248 1039 erg\ns\u22121 would have enough counts in the 2\u20138 keV band\nto be detected. An alternative possibility is that\nmost of the fitted values of NH in faint sources\nhave been underestimated (correspondingly, their\nphoton indices and intrinsic luminosities would\nalso have been underestimated). To test this scenario, we stacked the spectra of all sources with\n\u2264 50 counts; this is roughly equivalent to stacking\nall spectra of nuclear sources with LX . 1039 erg\ns\u22121 (most of the galaxies in our sample are at distances \u223c 10\u201315 Mpc). We then fitted the co-added\nspectrum with an absorbed power-law model; we\nobtain (Figure 7) that the best-fitting \u0393 \u2248 1.7,\nand NH,tot \u2248 5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , which is only slightly\nhigher than the average Galactic absorption for\nthe sources in the stacked sample. We conclude\n\nthat the co-added spectrum confirms a very low\nintrinsic absorption for the least luminous nuclear\nBHs.\nFurthermore, we conducted a MonteCarlo simulation to test whether the apparent absorption\u2013\nluminosity correlation could have been spuriously\nintroduced during spectral fitting (for example,\ndue to an overestimate of the intrinsic luminosity for sources with higher NH ). We assumed that\nthe unabsorbed flux for a simulated sample of 100\nsources has a uniform distribution (in log scale)\nfrom 10\u221213 to 10\u221210 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 0.3\u20138\nkeV band (similar to the range of fluxes typical\nof our real sample of nuclear sources), and their\nintrinsic NH has a uniform distribution (also in\nlog scale) from 1020 to 1024 cm\u22122 (Figure 8). In\nother words, we assumed no intrinsic correlation\nbetween luminosity and NH . We also assumed an\nabsorbed power-law spectrum with \u0393 = 1.7 for every source. We then fitted the simulated spectra\n(using the Cash statistics) with absorbed powerlaw models, leaving \u0393 and NH as free parameters,\nand we estimated the unabsorbed fluxes implied\nby the best-fitting model for each source. The\nfitted parameters do not show any correlation between unabsorbed fluxes and NH , or any signifi-\n\n11\n\n\fbe needed, to study the Hubble-type dependence\nfor a given range of luminosities and BH masses.\n\n20\nE\nEarly\nLate\n\nN\n\n15\n\n3.5.\n\nAmong the 86 galaxies with an X-ray core in\nour extended sample, 31 already have a measurememnt of their nuclear BH mass in the literature, based on stellar kinematics, gas kinematics, water masers, or reverberation mapping (see\ndetailed references in Table 4). For another 31\ngalaxies, stellar velocity dispersions of their cores\nare available from Hyperleda5 , with typical uncertainties \u223c 10\u201320%; in those cases, we used\nthe MBH \u2013\u03c3 relation (Tremaine et al. 2002) to estimate their BH masses. For 3 other cases, only\nphotometric observations are available: we constrained their BH masses via the MBH \u2013S\u00e9rsic index relation (Graham & Driver 2007). Thus, we\nhave 65 nuclear BHs in our sample with a mass\nestimate, out of 86 candidate X-ray cores (Table\n4).\nThe elliptical galaxies in our sample have larger\ninferred BH masses (MBH \u223c 108 M\u2299 ) and low Xray luminosities (LX . 1039 erg s\u22121 ), as expected.\nLate-type spirals also have low X-ray luminosities\n(LX . 1039 erg s\u22121 ) but the lowest BH masses\n(MBH \u223c 105 \u2013107 M\u2299 ). The most luminous nuclear BHs in the local universe (LX \u223c 1041 \u20131042\nerg s\u22121 ) are found in early-type spirals (Figure\n10, top panel). X-ray nuclei of barred galaxies are\nless luminous than those of non-barred galaxies,\nfor a given range of BH masses (Figure 10, middle\npanel). This is partly due to the higher fraction of\nstrongly-barred galaxies in late-type spirals, which\ntend to have weaker nuclear emission. Opticallyclassified Seyferts have the most luminous X-ray\nnuclei, as expected (Figure 10, bottom panel).\nThere is only a very weak positive correlation\n(slope \u2248 0.26 and correlation coefficient \u2248 0.19)\nbetween BH mass and X-ray luminosity. If the\nX-ray luminosity scaled with the Bondi accretion\nrate (Hoyle & Lyttleton 1939) onto the nuclear\n2\nBH, we would expect LX \u223c MBH\n\u03c1(\u221e)/c3s (\u221e),\n3\nwhere \u03c1(\u221e) and cs (\u221e) are the gas density and\nsound speed outside the accretion radius. The\nhigher gas density in the nuclear region of spiral\ngalaxies compensates for their lower BH masses.\nIn contrast, the lower abundance of gas avail-\n\n10\n5\n0\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n23\nlog (N )\n\n24\n\nEddington ratios\n\n25\n\nH\n\nFig. 9.- Relation between Hubble type and intrinsic column density NH .

This is opposite to the negative correlation between absorption\nand luminosity known to exist at higher luminosities (Hasinger 2008; Gilli et al. 2007; Ueda et al.\n2003). We also searched for a possible galaxymorphology dependence of the intrinsic column\ndensity; for example, whether late-type spirals\nhave systematically higher absorption than ellipticals. We find that all Hubble types appear dominated by unobscured sources, although the small\nnumber of sources in each class does not permit\nus to draw stronger conclusions (Figure 9). The\nnuclei of early-type spirals in our X-ray detected\nsample seem to be the most obscured: 15 of the\n42 nuclear sources detected in early-type spirals\nhave NH \u2265 1022 cm\u22122 ; only 3 of the 20 nuclear\nsources in late-type spirals, and none of the 6 elliptical nuclei have NH \u2265 1022 cm\u22122 .

The only outlier is the late-type,\nbarred (SBcd) Seyfert-2 galaxy NGC 4945, perhaps the only \"true\" AGN in our sample (L0.3\u22128 \u2248\n2\u00d71043 erg s\u22121 \u223c 0.1LEdd). This is also the galaxy\nwith the highest intrinsic absoprtion (NH \u223c 1024\ncm\u22122 ); see Done et al. (2003); Itoh et al. (2008)\nfor detailed X-ray studies of this AGN.\nEstimating the mass accretion rate from the observed luminosities requires the assumption of a\nmodel for the radiative and total efficiency. In\nour local-universe sample, even the most luminous nuclei (except for NGC 4945) are likely to\nbe in the low-radiative-efficiency regime, which is\nthought to set in for Lbol \u223c 10LX . 0.01LEdd, by\nanalogy with stellar-mass BHs (Esin et al. 1997;\nJester 2005). We adopted the ADAF scenario,\nwhich includes contributions to the emitted flux\nfrom disk-blackbody (truncated outer disk), synchrotron, bremsstrahlung and inverse-Compton\n(Narayan et al. 1997, 1998). ADAF spectral models scale with the BH mass and the dimensionless accretion parameter \u1e41 \u2261 Lbol / (\u03b7LEdd ) =\n\u1e40 c2 /LEdd \u221d \u1e40 /\u1e40Edd , where \u03b7 is the radiative\nefficiency (\u03b7 \u223c 0.1 for efficient accretion)6 . Other\nphysical information is included in three (dimensionless) parameters: the ratio of gas to magnetic\npressure; the viscosity parameter; and the fraction\nof viscous heating that goes into the electrons. A\nuseful table of band-limited X-ray luminosities for\na grid of ADAF spectral models, as a function of\nBH mass and accretion parameter (with standard\nassumptions for the other three parameters), was\ncalculated by Merloni et al. (2003). We used their\ngrid values and interpolations to estimate \u1e41 of\nour sample nuclei, from their observed X-ray luminosities and indirectly-inferred BH masses. We\nobtain a range of accretion parameters \u1e41 \u223c 10\u22125 \u2013\n\n4.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe studied the X-ray nuclear activity of\nnearby galaxies (distance < 15 Mpc), in a\nrange of luminosities intermediate between lowluminosity AGN and \"normal\" non-active galaxies. More specifically, we chose a complete sample\nof optically/IR-selected Northern galaxies, as defined in Swartz et al. (2008); most of the galaxies\nin this sample were observed by Chandra/ACIS\nfor a ULX survey. We then extended that sample\nwith another \u223c 70 galaxies (also at distances < 15\nMpc) with publicly-available Chandra/ACIS data;\nthe extended sample contains 187 galaxies. The\nmain results presented in this paper are:\n1. We made a census of weakly active nuclei in\nthe local neighbourhood, down to a completeness\nlimit LX \u2248 2 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 in the 0.3\u20138 keV band.\nEighty-six out of 187 galaxies have a point-like\nnuclear X-ray source, coincident (within 1\u2032\u2032 ) with\nthe radio or infrared nuclear position. The presence of an X-ray core depends strongly on Hubble type: \u2248 60 per cent of early-type galaxies (E\nto Sb) contain an X-ray core, but only \u2248 30 per\ncent of later-type galaxies. About 90 per cent of\noptically-classified Seyfert and LINERs have a nuclear X-ray source with LX & 2\u00d71038 erg s\u22121 ; this\nfraction drops to \u2248 60 per cent for transition objects, and \u2248 30 per cent for HII nuclei. The AGN\ndemographics from our Chandra survey is consistent with the AGN demographics inferred from optical spectroscopic studies, for example the Palomar survey (Ho 2008, and references therein). Our\nChandra survey suggests that point-like nuclear Xray emission is a reliable indicator of BH activity\nin normal galaxies, especially in cases where optical signatures of BH accretion may be swamped\nby the surrounding stellar emission.\n2. Spiral and elliptical galaxies within 15 Mpc\nare detected with a continuous range of nuclear luminosities from \u223c 1038 erg s\u22121 to \u223c 1042 erg s\u22121 .\nThere is no gap between low-luminosity AGN and\nBH activity in normal galaxies. The cumulative\nluminosity distribution can be fitted by a powerlaw with a slope of \u2248 \u22120.5. Because of the relatively small number of galaxies in our sample, we\n\n6 With\n\nthis definition, the transition between ADAF and\nstandard-disk accretion occurs at \u1e41 \u223c 0.1, and \u1e41 \u2248 10\nfor Lbol \u2248 LEdd .

Right panel: relation between BH mass, accretion parameter \u1e41 and optical spectroscopic nuclear\nclass (S = Seyfert, L = LINER, T = transition object, H = HII nucleus).\ncannot yet accurately determine whether the luminosity distribution of those faint nuclei matches\nthe slope and normalization of the luminosity distribution of fully-fledged AGN (LX >\u223c 1042 erg\ns\u22121 ). However, we are currently studying a larger\nChandra sample of galaxies (within 40 Mpc) and\nwe will address this issue in a follow-up paper.\n3. For each individual X-ray core with luminosities \u223c 1038 \u20131039 erg s\u22121 , it is always very difficult\nto distinguish between a nuclear BH and an unrelated, luminous X-ray binary in the nuclear region.\nHowever, on a statistical basis, we have discussed\nvarious reasons why we think that the majority\nof detected sources are nuclear BHs rather than\nX-ray binaries (Section 3.1). Most of the X-ray\nsources are exactly coincident with the nuclear position, and there are much fewer sources in the\nannulus between 1\u2032\u2032 and 5\u2032\u2032 from the radio/optical\nnucleus. Besides, the luminosity distribution has\nno hint of a break at LX \u2248 1040 erg s\u22121 , as we\nwould expect from a population of high-mass Xray binaries. The ratio between nuclear H\u03b1 luminosity (when available, from the Palomar survey) and X-ray luminosity is more typical of lowluminosity AGN than of star-forming regions with\nyoung X-ray binaries.\n4. We fitted the spectra of each source, assuming absorbed power-law models with two free\n\nparameters: the photon index and the intrinsic absorption. The photon index is consistent\nwith the expected value for AGN (\u0393 \u2248 1.5\u20132).\nThe intrinsic column density NH is positively\ncorrelated with the emitted X-ray luminosity:\namong the population of fainter nuclear BHs, very\nfew or none can be classified as Type-2 (highly\nobscured). This is the opposite of the trend\nknown for luminous AGN, with LX > 1042 erg\ns\u22121 (Hasinger 2008; Gilli et al. 2007; Ueda et al.\n2003). It is still not clear what produces the absorption (a geometrically-thick parsec-scale torus?\nAn optically-thick disk wind?), and hence we cannot determine from the data available what causes\nthe fraction of obscured sources to be highest for\nsources with LX \u223c 1042 \u20131043 erg s\u22121 , and to\ndecrease at both lower and higher nuclear BH luminosities. At high luminosities, it was suggested\nthat the thick torus gets progressively evaporated\nor ablated by the radiation flux from the central\nobject (Hasinger 2008; Menci et al. 2008). On the\nother hand, X-ray faint nuclei have less gas available for accretion. They may not be surrounded\nby a torus at all; or the torus may collapse and\nbecome geometrically thin, so that only galaxies seen perfectly edge-on would be classified as\nType-2; or, instead, the dramatic decrease in absorption may be caused by the suppression of the\noptically-thick disk wind. Alternatively, it was\n15\n\n\fsuggested (Hopkins et al. 2009) that a large fraction of sources with LX \u223c 1042 \u20131044 erg s\u22121 have\nbeen erroneously classified as obscured, because of\noptical dilution effects, and because of the transition from a standard-disk accretion geometry to\na radiatively-inefficient flow. Both effects would\nmake those sources less prominent or invisible\nin the UV/optical band, and slightly harder in\nthe X-ray band, thus making them appear \"obscured\" even though they are not. Based on those\narguments, it was proposed that the fraction of\ntruly obscured sources can be as low as 20 per\ncent, independent of luminosity (Hopkins et al.\n2009). However, an opposite result was obtained\nby Reyes et al. (2008), based on an opticallyselected sample of quasars from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey; they find that at least half of the\nquasars in the nearby Universe (z . 0.8) are truly\nobscured, particularly in the high-luminosity population. In our sample of sources, the absorbing\ncolumn densities are estimated directly from the\nfitted X-ray spectra, and do not rely on hardness\nratios or optical/X-ray flux ratios, thus reducing\nthe bias discussed by Hopkins et al. (2009). Thus,\nwe suggest that the high fraction (10 out of 15)\nof obscured sources at X-ray luminosities > 1040\nerg s\u22121 (0.3\u20138 keV band) may be really due to a\nhigher density of absorbing gas or dust around the\nnuclear BH (whatever its geometry) in that moderate luminosity range. The fraction of obscured\nnuclei seems to depend more directly on luminosity rather than Hubble type. In our sample,\nslightly more nuclei detected in early-type spirals\nseem to be obscured (NH \u2265 1022 cm\u22122 ), compared with the obscured fractions in ellipticals\nand late-type spirals; however, we do not have\nenough galaxies to draw strong conclusions. We\nare planning further work with a larger sample of\ngalaxies to address this issue.\n5. Having argued that the apparent luminosity\ndependence of the obscured fraction of nuclei is\ntruly due to changes in the column density of the\nabsorbing medium, we can still look for a causal\nlink between such changes and the disappearance\nof the standard disk at low accretion rates (or\nother transitions in the geometry of the accretion\nflow). For example, the disk may disappear when\nit is no longer fed by a large torus; or, vice versa,\noptically-thick winds may be suppressed when the\nstandard disk turns into an optically-thin ADAF.\n\nIt was already noted (Ho 2008) that the decrease\nor suppression of the intrinsic absorption at low luminosities often coincides with the disappearance\nof optical signatures of a standard accretion disk.\nIf the apparent or real changes in the obscuration\nfraction are due to a sharp standard-disk/ADAF\ntransition at \u1e41 \u223c 0.1, we should not expect a\ntrend in our sample, because all but one of our\nsources are almost certainly below this threshold,\nin the radiatively-inefficient regime. Instead, we\nsee changes in the fraction of obscured sources over\nthe X-ray luminosity range \u223c 1039 \u20131042 erg s\u22121\nand \u1e41 \u223c 10\u22124 \u201310\u22122 . This suggests a more gradual evolution in the amount of absorbing material\nbelow the radiatively-inefficient threshold; or perhaps a more gradual disappearance of the outer accretion disk at low accretion rates. It was also recently suggested (Zhu et al. 2008; Wang & Zhang\n2007) that a dusty torus (produced during major galaxy mergers, or via secular evolution processes) can provide the main source of fuel in a selfregulated way: when it is completely evaporated\nby the radiation from the central source, the AGN\nphase turns off and the supermassive BH becomes\ninactive; this scenario is among those consistent\nwith our observational findings.\n6. We confirm that there is no positive correlation between the presence of a bar and the Xray luminosity of the nucleus. Large-scale bars\nare highly effective in delivering gas to the central\nfew hundred parsecs of a spiral galaxy and therefore enhance the probability and rate of star formation in the nuclear region (Heller & Shlosman\n1994). However, it was observed from optical/IR\nsurveys (Ho et al. 1997d; Hunt & Malkan 1999;\nLaurikainen et al. 2004) that the presence of a bar\nseems to have no impact on either the frequency\nor strength of AGN activity-with the possible exception of Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies, which\nmay be preferentially associated with barred spirals (Ohta et al. 2007). In fact, our results suggest a negative correlation, with strongly barred\ngalaxies having a less active nuclear BH than nonbarred/weakly barred galaxies, for a given range\nof BH masses and Hubble types (we do not have\nNarrow-Line Seyfert 1s in our sample). This\npreliminary but intriguing result will have to be\ntested more strongly on our larger Chandra sample we are currently studying. If confirmed, it may\nsuggest that there is less gas reaching the super-\n\n16\n\n\fmassive BH when there is circumnuclear star formation (i.e., in most strongly-barred galaxies). In\nthis scenario, galaxies may cycle through phases\nof dominant nuclear star formation (when a bar\nis present) and phases dominated by nuclear BH\naccretion. One possible explanation could be that\nnuclear star formation in spiral galaxies actively\ndisfavours gas inflows towards the nuclear BH-\nmost of the gas not used for star formation may\nbe blown away by supernova-powered outflows. In\naddition, there may be a mismatch between the\ncharacteristic timescales of bar formation and disruption (\u2248 a few 108 yrs: Combes & Elmegreen\n(1993)), and the longer timescales of nuclear BH\naccretion. In this scenario (Hunt & Malkan 1999),\nbars and associated nuclear star formation would\nappear first, and nuclear activity later, after the\nbar-driven star formation has subsided.\n7. There is an anticorrelation between the BH\nmass and the Eddington ratio: elliptical galaxies\nin the local universe have higher BH masses but\nmuch lower accretion parameters, corresponding\nto X-ray luminosities \u223c 10\u22128 LEdd . When latetype spirals have an X-ray nuclear source, their\nluminosities are \u223c 10\u22124 LEdd , because they have\na larger supply of gas. In any case, all classes of\nnuclear sources in our sample are expected to be\nin the radiatively-inefficient regime, dominated either by energy advection (e.g., ADAF) or by nonradiative output channels (jets). We are planning\nfurther work to determine the radio core luminosity of the nuclear X-ray sources detected in our\nsample.\n\nport during the completion of this work.\nREFERENCES\nAntonucci, R. 1993, ARA&A, 31, 473\nArnaud, K.
