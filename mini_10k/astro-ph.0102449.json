The\ndetection of cyanopolyacetylenes in dense interstellar clouds (Kroto 1981) led to the suggestion by\n1\n\nVisiting Astronomer, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, operated by the National Research Council of Canada,\nthe Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nDouglas (1977) that carbon chain species be considered as candidates for the diffuse interstellar\nbands (DIBs), which are found in the 4000-8500\u00c5 spectral region of stars reddened by interstellar\ndust (Herbig 1995). Since then, many other molecules with a carbon chain backbone have been\nidentified at radio frequencies in dense clouds (Kawaguchi et al. 1995). Meanwhile, advances in\nlaboratory measurements have provided an understanding of the types and sizes of carbon chains\nwhich have strong electronic transitions in the DIB range (Maier 1998). It is thus somewhat\nsurprising that as yet among the bare carbon species only diatomic C2 has been identified in\ninterstellar clouds where DIB are detected.\nThe 4052\u00c5 electronic band system of C3 was first detected in comets (Swings 1942) and then in\ncircumstellar shells by infrared spectroscopy (Hinkle et al. 1988). Most recently C3 was identified in\na dense cloud using sub-mm measurements of its low frequency bending mode and Ntot (C3 )\u223c 1013\ncm\u22122 was estimated (Cernicharo et al. 2000). Snow et al. (1988) established an upper limit of 5\u00d71010\ncm\u22122 for the column density of C3 in the direction of \u03b6 Oph, some two orders of magnitude lower\nthan that set by Clegg & Lambert (1982). Haffner & Meyer (1995) made a tentative detection of\nC3 towards an eighth magnitude star in the same part of the sky, HD 147889, at a column density\nof 4\u00d71012 cm\u22122 . Unfortunately, the star turned out to be a (previously unknown) double-lined\nspectroscopic binary which limited their sensitivity.\nThis letter presents the detection of C3 towards three stars and infers the column densities\n\u2212\n\u2212\nin the diffuse clouds. Although C+\n2 , C2 and C3 were not detected, upper limits for their column\ndensities are estimated. Diatomic species, such as CH, CN, C2 , and CH+ , have been detected\ntowards two of the stars chosen and their column densities are considered standards with which to\ncompare models for the physical and chemical processes in diffuse regions (van Dishoeck & Black\n\u2212\n\u2212\n1986). The four bare carbon chains, C3 , C+\n2 , C2 and C3 , were selected for the present search\nbecause gas phase electronic transitions for these species have been identified in the laboratory in\nthe 4000-5500\u00c5 region and their oscillator strengths are known (see table 3).\n\n2.\n\nThe Observations\n\nObservations of the reddened stars \u03b6 Oph (HD 149757), \u03b6 Per (HD 24398) and 20 Aql (HD\n179406) were made with the Gecko echellette spectrograph on 2000 July 16 and 19, fiber fed from\nthe Cassegrain focus of the Canada-France-Hawaii 3.6-m telescope (CFHT) (Baudrand & Vitry\n2000). All three stars have a visual extinction, Av , near 1 and were chosen because they are bright\nwith sharp interstellar K I lines indicating either single clouds or little Doppler distortion (in the\ncase of \u03b6 Oph, ? resolved the C2 at 8756 \u00c5 into two close velocity components separated by 1.1\nkm s\u22121 ).\nThe detector was a rear illuminated EEV1 CCD (13.5 \u03bcm2 pixels) and the spectral regions\nwere centered at 4047 \u00c5 in the 14th order, and at 5060 \u00c5 and 5400 \u00c5 in the 11th and 10th orders,\nrespectively. The ultraviolet Gecko prism was used to isolate the 14th order, the blue grism for the\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n11th order, while the stock CFHT filter #1515 was used for the 10th order observations. Individual\nspectra had exposure times ranging from 5 to 20 minutes and were obtained with continuous fiber\nagitation to overcome modal noise. The resulting combined spectra for the individual stars at each\nwavelength had unusually high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N\u223c800-4000) for CCD observations. The\nTh/Ar comparison arc spectra, taken before and after each spectrograph wavelength reconfiguration, had a typical FWHM of 2.8 pixels, which corresponds to resolutions of R = 121000, 113000\nand 101000 at 4047, 5060 and 5400 \u00c5, respectively.\nProcessing of the spectra was conventional. Groups of biases were taken several times throughout each night and at each grating setting a series of flat-field spectra of a quartz-iodide lamp were\nrecorded. The biases and appropriate flats were averaged and used to remove the zero-level offset\nand pixel-to-pixel sensitivity variations of the CCD. One-dimensional spectra were extracted using standard IRAF routines. Spectra of Vega and other unreddened stars were used to search for\ncontaminating telluric water vapor lines and stellar photospheric features. Heliocentric corrections\nwere applied to each spectrum.\nThe observations are summarised in Table 1 which lists exposure times and S/N per pixel for\neach spectral region. The final column gives the radial velocities measured from the interstellar\nK I 4044.1 and 4047.2 \u00c5 lines. These velocities have been applied to each spectrum to put the\ninterstellar features on a laboratory scale.\n\n3.\n\nThe Results\n\nThe A1 \u03a0u \u2212 X 1 \u03a3+\ng origin band of C3 is quite clearly detected towards all three stars. Figure 1\ncompares the observed spectra with a simulated C3 absorption spectrum based on the spectrograph\nresolution and assuming a Boltzmann distribution in the ground state rotational levels with a temperature of 80 K. The continuum noise level in the observations is \u223c0.1 %. Low order polynomials\nhave been applied to the stellar data to give a level continuum (base line) and, in the case of \u03b6\nPer, a weak, broad stellar feature at 4053.2\u00c5 has been removed. Residual broad features in the\nfinal spectra are only a few tenths of a percent deep, much less than in the original, and they in no\nway mask the sharp C3 lines. In the simulation the rotational line intensities were calculated using\nthe H\u00f6nl-London factors, while the line positions were taken from the laboratory measurements\n(this avoids the problem of a perturbation affecting the low J ground state levels which is not\naccounted for by the fitted spectroscopic constants). The individual rotational P, Q and R lines are\nclearly resolved in the spectra of all three stars. Table 2 lists the observed positions and equivalent\nwidths of each rotational line assigned in the spectra of the three stars. The table also gives the\ncorresponding positions measured for these transitions in the laboratory (Gausset et al. 1965). The\npositions of some 30 lines in the spectrum of \u03b6 Oph agree with the laboratory data to within 0.1\ncm\u22121 providing an unambiguous identification of C3 in these diffuse clouds.\n+\n4 \u2212\nFigures 2, 3, and 4 show the results of equivalent searches for B 4 \u03a3\u2212\nu \u2212X \u03a3g origin band of C2 at\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\u2212\n2 +\n2\n2\n5078.1\u00c5 (\u03b6 Oph only), the B 2 \u03a3+\nu \u2212X \u03a3g origin band of C2 at 5415.9\u00c5 and the A \u2206u \u2212X \u03a0g origin\nband of C\u2212\n3 at 4040.4\u00c5, together with simulated spectra for these transitions at 80 K based upon\nthe published spectroscopic constants (Maier & R\u00f6sslein (1988), Herzberg & Lagerqvist (1968),\n+\nTulej et al. (2000)). In the cases of C\u2212\n2 and C2 the linewidth was assumed to be determined by\nthe spectrograph resolution. For C\u2212\n3 the excited state has been identified as a short-lived Feshbach\nresonance and the measured natural linewidth of \u223c1 cm\u22121 is employed in the simulation. Weak\n\u2212\ntelluric lines were been removed from the C+\n2 and C2 observations using standard procedures.\n\nUnlike the 4050\u00c5 region for C3 , each of these spectral regions is contaminated by weak stellar\n\u2212\nfeatures. Nonetheless, for the C+\n2 and C2 ions, there are no sharp features corresponding to the\nrotational lines in the simulations. On the other hand, for C\u2212\n3 there are features in the spectrum\nof \u03b6 Per and (much less convincing) in the magnified plot for \u03b6 Oph which appear to coincide in\nposition and shape with the simulated band heads. It is unlikely that these are due to C\u2212\n3 because\nthe stellar lines in \u03b6 Per have exactly the same shape as the coincident features. For \u03b6 Oph the\nwhole C\u2212\n3 spectrum sits within a weak stellar feature (the lines are broadened by rapid rotation\n\u223c400 km s\u22121 ). The photospheric lines in \u03b6 Oph show nonradial pulsation 'ripples' which will be\n'washed out' to some extent by the long exposure time employed. The spectrum of 20 Aql, which\nnormally has the strongest interstellar lines of the three, is free of stellar features but has no features\n\u2212\ncoincident with the C\u2212\n3 simulation. It is concluded that, while interstellar C3 might be absent for\n20 Aql and present for the other two stars, it is more likely that in the latter cases the features are\ninstead stellar.\nTable 3 gives the measured equivalent widths for the most intense C3 line (Q(8)) for each star\n\u2212\n\u2212\ntogether with an 1\u03c3 error estimate. For C+\n2 , C2 and C3 , 3\u03c3 detection limits are given. The 1\u03c3\nlevel errors and detection limits are derived from:\n1\n\nW\u03bb = (wd) 2 (S/N )\u22121\nwhere the 1\u03c3 limiting equivalent width, W\u03bb , and the FWHM of the feature, w, are both measured\nin \u00c5, the spectrograph dispersion, d, in \u00c5 pixel\u22121 , and S/N is the signal to noise per pixel. From\n+\n\u2212\nthe simulations, w = 0.045, 1.0, 0.13 and 0.045\u00c5 for C3 , C\u2212\n3 , C2 and C2 , respectively.\nIn the case of C3 , equivalent widths, W\u03bb , were determined for each rotational line (varying\nbetween 0.3-2.7\u00d710\u22124 \u00c5) and, in combination with the transition oscillator strength, f0\u22120 , and H\u00f6nlLondon factors, the column densities, NJ (C3 ), of each rotational level (J) in the ground electronic\nstate were calculated (Larsson 1983). In cases where several rotational lines originating from the\nsame level were assigned (e.g. P(8), Q(8), R(8)) the mean of the determined column densities was\ntaken. Figure 5 shows a Boltzmann plot of ln(NJ /(2J + 1)) vs. the rotational energy (Gausset et\nal. 1965) where the slope is inversely proportional to the rotational temperature. Among the lowest\nrotational levels (J <14) the populations are reasonably approximated by a distribution at 50-70\nK, whereas the higher rotational levels correspond to a temperature of 200-300 K. The simulation\nin Figure 1 uses 80 K as this represents an average temperature for the entire rotational population\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nand allows both the high and low J lines to be identified. The high temperature component of the\ndistribution is apparent in the astronomical spectra where the R band head and the higher Q lines\nare more intense than in the simulation (Figure 1).\nLutz & Crutcher (1983) also found a bimodal population distribution for C2 in diffuse clouds,\nwith similar characteristic temperatures for the low and high J values. The lower temperature\nis interpreted as the kinetic energy of the cloud and for both C2 and C3 the values obtained are\ncomparable to those used in models of diffuse clouds (van Dishoeck & Black 1986). The higher\ntemperature component is attributed to repopulation of the levels in the ground electronic state\nby radiative pumping from excited states. In the case of C3 it is expected that both the 1 \u03a0u state\nand the higher lying 1 \u03a3+\nu state will contribute to the radiative pumping.\nThe sensitivity of these measurements is such that NJ (C3 ) in the range 0.2-2\u00d71011 cm\u22122 is\ndetermined for rotational levels up to J=30. The NJ values were summed to give the estimated\nlower limits in the range 1-2\u00d71012 cm\u22122 for the total column density, Ntot (C3 ), in Table 3.\n\n3.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nA previous search for C3 in the direction of \u03b6 Oph did not identify the molecule (Snow et al.\n1988). It is unclear why this was the case as, in the light of the present observations, the signal-tonoise quoted for these measurements was adequate and the upper limit given was some thirty times\nlower than the column density reported here. The present measurements for the column densities\nof C3 are of the same order of magnitude as the tentative estimate for a translucent cloud (Haffner\n& Meyer 1995) and can be compared to those of other polyatomic molecules observed in diffuse\ninterstellar clouds. Column densities (also towards \u03b6 Oph) in the 1012\u221213 cm\u22122 range have been\ninferred for HCO+ , C2 H and C3 H2 from observations in the mm region by Lucas & Liszt (2000),\n+\n14\n\u22122 by McCall et\nwhile H+\n3 has been identified in diffuse regions and Ntot (H3 ) estimated \u223c 4\u00d710 cm\nal. (1998). Column densities of C2 towards \u03b6 Oph and \u03b6 Per have been determined in the 2-3\u00d71013\ncm\u22122 range by Federman & Huntress (1989). A current model of the diffuse clouds by Ruffle &\nHerbst (2000) predicts Ntot (C2 )/Ntot (C3 ) \u223c 20 (on a 105 year time scale), implying Ntot (C3 )\u223c 1012\ncm\u22122 , in agreement with the values deduced from the Table 3. The main production route to C3\nis presumed to be the dissociative recombination process: C3 H+ + e \u2192 C3 + H, where C3 H+ is\nproduced from smaller species by C+ ion insertion. Under conditions where ultra-violet radiation\n1 +\npenetrates, photodissociation of C3 takes place at a threshold of 1653\u00c5. As the strong 1 \u03a3+\nu \u2212 \u03a3g\nelectronic transition of C3 is predicted to occur around 1700\u00c5 (Forney et al. 1996), the dissociation\nprocess, C3 \u2192 C2 + C, may be an important destruction pathway in diffuse clouds.\n+\n\u2212\nAlthough only upper limits for the column densities of C\u2212\n3 , C2 and C2 could be presently\nestablished, these species are of interest as small ionic carbon fragments play a crucial role in the\nion molecule schemes for diffuse cloud chemistry (Dalgano & Black 1976). The C+\n2 ion is the only\nbare carbon cation for which the gas phase electronic spectrum is known (Maier & R\u00f6sslein 1988).\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nIn diffuse clouds it is supposed to be the product of the fundamental step: C+ + CH \u2192 C+\n2 + H.\n+\n+\nIts main destruction mechanism is hydrogenation: C2 + H2 \u2192 C2 H + H, which dominates over\nrecombination with electrons in diffuse regions. The diffuse cloud model (Ruffle & Herbst 2000)\n\u22123 lower than C , implying a column density \u223c 1010 cm\u22122 ,\npredicts a C+\n2\n2 abundance a factor of 10\nin accord with the upper limit in Table 3.\nPublished models for diffuse regions do not include the smallest pure carbon anions, C\u2212\n2 and\n+\n\u2212\nC\u2212\nin\ntheir\nreaction\nlibraries.\nUnlike\nC\n,\nC\ndoes\nnot\nreact\nwith\nH\nso\nits\nmain\ndestruction\n2\n3\n2\n2\nmechanism is expected to be photodetachment. The similar rotational line widths and oscillator\n+\nstrengths of the C\u2212\n2 and C2 transitions lead to similar upper limits for their total column densities.\nThe width of the unresolved bands for C\u2212\n3 and the presence of weak stellar features in this spectral\nregion means that a higher column density of this ion could have escaped detection.\nThe detection of C3 provides a powerful incentive for the laboratory study of the electronic\ntransitions of longer carbon chains in the gas phase with the aim of comparison with DIB data.\nThe question as to what types and sizes of carbon chains will have strong transitions in the 40001 +\n9000\u00c5 range has already been answered: for example, 1 \u03a3+\nu \u2212 \u03a3g transitions of the odd-number\nbare chains, C2n+1 , n=8-30 (Maier 1998). The existence of linear carbon chains up to C21 has\nbeen confirmed by the observation of their electronic spectra in neon matrices (Wyss et al. 1999).\nAs the oscillator strength scales almost linearly with the length of the molecule, one can expect\nf0\u22120 \u223c10-20 for these carbon chains. With such an oscillator strength, a species with a column\ndensity \u223c 1011 cm\u22122 would be enough to give rise to a strong DIB, with an equivalent width of 1\u00c5.\nIn view of the column density \u223c1012 cm\u22122 for C3 determined in this work for three diffuse clouds,\nthis appears to be a reasonable expectation.\nThe support of the Swiss National Science Foundation (project no. 20-055285.98), the Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the National Research Council of\nCanada is gratefully acknowledged.
