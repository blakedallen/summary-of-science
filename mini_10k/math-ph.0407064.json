From fundamental point of view, this topic introduces a new interaction\nbetween non-equilibrium conduction electrons and local\nmoments, and the physics of this new interaction has not\nbeen well explored. From the application point of view,\nthe current-induced magnetization reversal opens a novel\nway to control and manipulate the magnetization dynamics that is one of the central issues in modern magnetic\ntechnologies. In conventional magnetic devices, the magnetization direction is controlled by external magnetic\nfields generated by a current or by a permanent magnet.\nThese magnetic fields are usually spread into a relatively\nlarge spatial extent. The CIMR can be confined to an\nexact spatial region where the current flows; this property is very attractive for magnetic nano-devices, e.g.,\nmagnetic random access memory.\nThe physics of the current-induced magnetization reversal involves interplay between non-equilibrium conduction electrons and local magnetization. Namely, the\nspin angular momentum carried by spin polarized electrons is transferred to the local moment through the exchange interaction. This is somewhat analogue to the\nwell-known phenomenon of electromigration [7] where\n(impurity) atoms move along the direction opposite to\nthe direction of the current. The origin of the electromigration is mainly from the transfer of linear momentum\nof non-equilibrium conduction electrons to atoms, resulting a \"wind force\" which drives migration of the atom.\nFor magnetic materials where the electric current is spin\npolarized, it is possible that the spin-polarization of nonequilibrium conduction electrons changes its orientation\nalong the direction of the current, and thus the local-\n\nFIG. 1: Cartesian and polar coordinate systems\n\nized magnetic moment receives a spin torque if the conduction electron continuously transfers their spin angular\nmomentum to the local moment in the steady state of the\ncurrent flow. This non-equilibrium conduction electron\ninduced spin torque can alter magnetization structures,\ndrive magnetization dynamics and even create the domain wall motion. Up until now, the spin transfer model\nhas been mainly on a trilayer structure where two ferromagnetic layers are separated by a spacer layer. Typically, one chooses the spacer layer thick enough to reduce the magnetic coupling between the two ferromagnetic layers and thin enough to minimize the spin-flip\nscattering in the spacer so that the spin transfer torque is\nmaximized. Several theoretical models [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\nhave been put forward to formulate the spin torque in\nterms of geometric and materials parameters. While it is\nstill debatable on the correct microscopic picture of the\nspin torque, all theories contain a spin torque in the form\nof\naJ\n\u03c4a = \u2212\nM \u00d7 (M \u00d7 M\u0302p )\n(1)\nMs\nwhere M is the magnetization of the free layer, M\u0302p is the\nunit vector along the direction of the magnetization of the\npinned layer, Ms is the saturation magnetization, and\naJ is a model-dependent parameter and is proportional\nto the current density. In general, the magnitude aJ of\nthe spin transfer torque is also a function of the angle\nbetween the pinned and free layer magnetization vectors.\n\n\f2\nSeveral theoretical attempts [13, 14, 15, 16] were made\nin understanding the unique features displayed in the\nspin torque, Eq. (1). Here we just list three of them\nbelow: 1) the spin torque may stabilize steady precessional states, i.e., the magnetization does not converge\nto a meta-stable static state even at zero temperature;\n2) the spin torque may create a new stable configuration\nof the magnetization, e.g., an out-of-plane magnetization\ndirection can be a new solution of meta-stable states; 3)\nthe spin torque modifies the effective energy barrier or\ntemperature in a significant and unique way.\nAll of the above novel properties are derived based on\nthe specific form of the spin torque, Eq. (1). Equation\n(1) has assumed that both free and pinned layers have\nuniform magnetization within the layers, at least along\nthe direction of the current. In a typical ferromagnet, the\nmagnetization is rarely uniform and the dynamical process of magnetization is not coherent rotation in general.\nIt would be interesting to find what the spin torque does\nto magnetization dynamics of non-single domain ferromagnets. Berger [17] introduced the \"domain drag force\"\nby considering the spin torque in a single layer system\nwhere the magnetization is not uniform along the current. He argued, based on his intuitive physics picture,\nthat the current can drag the domain wall along the path\nof the current flow. Bazaliy et al. proposed a spin torque\nin a ferromagnet within the ballistic transport model for\nhalf-metallic materials [18]. Most recently, we have generalized the spin torque for any diffusive transport ferromagnet [19],\n\nI, we list the values of bJ for a selected set of materials for a spin current density je = 107 A/cm2 . The\nhalf-metals, CrO2 and F e2 O3 , has a maximum spin polarization (P=1) and has low saturation magnetization,\nand thus the spin torque is larger than that of transition\nmetals.\n\n\u03c4 st = \u2212bJ M\u0302 \u00d7 [M\u0302 \u00d7 (\u0135e * \u2207)M]\n\nWe assume the current flows in x-direction, along the\nlong length of a wire, i.e., \u0135e = ex . By placing this into\nEq. (2) and by treating Eq. (2) as an additional torque\non the standard LLG equation, we write the generalized\nLLG equation in the presence of the spin torque as,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202M\n\u2202M\n\u2202M\n= \u2212\u03b3M \u00d7 Hef f + \u03b1M\u0302 \u00d7\n\u2212 bJ M\u0302 \u00d7 M\u0302 \u00d7\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n(3)\nwhere \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio, and Hef f is the effective magnetic field including the external field, the\nanisotropy field, magnetostatic field, and the exchange\nfield, and \u03b1 is the Gilbert damping parameter.\nWe now specify the geometry of the wire and the effective field entering Eq. (3). As shown in Fig. 1, the x-axis\nis taken as the easy axis as well as the direction of the\nexternal field Hext . The width and the thickness of the\nwire are D and d, respectively. A current is along the x\ndirection. We explicitly write the effective field,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere M\u0302 = M/Ms , \u0135e = je /je and bJ = P je \u03bcB /eMs , P\nis the spin polarization of the current, \u03bcB is Bohr magnetron, and je is the electric current density. The above\ntorque has identical form as that of Bazaliy et al [18].\nHowever, we derived the above formulation on a general\nproperty of ferromagnetic materials: in a ferromagnet,\nthe spin polarization of the current is always along the\ndirection of the local magnetization vector, i.e., the transverse component of the spin current can be neglected\n[10, 11, 19]. Thus one may define a spin current tensor\nJ = (\u03bcB /eMs )P je \u2297 M(r). The spin transfer torque\nis defined as the rate change of the angular momentum\nof conduction electrons that are transferred to the local\nmagnetization, \u03c4 st = dm/dt = \u2202m/\u2202t + \u2207 * J . In the\nsteady state of the current flow, \u2202m/\u2202t = 0 and thus we\nfind the above spin torque can be written as Eq. (2) if\nwe use the fact that the magnitude of the local magnetization vector is a constant.\nWhile the magnitude of the spin torque in spin valves,\nEq. (1), depends on many unknown parameters such as\ninterface spin-dependent resistance, the magnitude of the\nadiabatic spin transfer torque, bJ in Eq. (2), can be\naccurately estimated for many ferromagnetic materials.\nbJ , which has a dimension of velocity, is determined by\ntwo materials parameters: Ms and P ; these parameters\nhave already been determined experimentally.

In the absence of a current and/or an external magnetic field, we consider that the domain wall,\nseparated by two head-to-head domains along the wire\ndirection, is a N\u00e9el wall whose magnetization stays in\nthe plane of the wire, i.e., Mz = 0, Mx = Ms cos \u03b8,\nMy = Ms sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, where\n\u03c6 = 0;\n\u03b8 = 2tan\u22121 exp(x/W0 )\n(7)\np\nand W0 = 2A/HK Ms is the domain wall width. At\nt = 0, an electric current/an external field is applied. We\nshould determine the motion of the wall at t > 0 from\nEqs. (5) and (6) by utilizing the initial condition, Eq. (7).\n\nIII.\n\nANALYTICAL RESULTS\n\nThe non-linear partial-differential equations, Eqs. (5)\nand (6), are difficult to solve. Here we follow Walker's\nanalysis of domain wall motion by introducing a trial\nfunction [20].\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(t );\n\nBy placing this trial function into Eqs. (5) and (6), and\nby utilizing the following identities,\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u22022\u03c6\n=0\n=\n\u2202x\n\u2202x2\n\u2202\u03b8\n= c(t ) sin \u03b8;\n\u2202x\n\nand defining a function c1 (x, t ),\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ t\ndc(t )\nx\u2212\nv (\u03c4 )d \u03c4 \u2212 c(t )v (t )\nc1 (x, t ) \u2261\ndt\n0\n\n(9)\n\nwe find\nd\u03c6\n= \u22124\u03c0\u03b3Ms sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 + bJ c(t )\ndt\nd\u03c6\n\u2212\u03b1c1 (x, t ) +\n\u2212 \u03b3Hext =\ndt\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2A\nc(t )2 + 4\u03c0Ms sin2 \u03c6 cos \u03b8\n\u03b3 HK \u2212\nMs\n\nc1 (x, t ) + \u03b1\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nStrictly speaking, Eqs. (10) and (11) can not be valid\nbecause c1 (x, t) defined in Eq. (9) is linearly proportional\nto x but there are no other terms in Eq. (10) and (11)\ncontaining spatial variable x. Thus, the trial function of\nthe form of Eq. (8) is only possible when one discards the\nspatial dependence of c1 . Equivalently, the first term in\nthe right side of Eq. (9) must be much smaller compared\nto the second term so that c1 \u2248 \u2212c(t)v(t). While one\nwould not determine the smallness of this first term a\nprior, we will later confirm that c(t) only shrinks by a\nfew percent during the domain wall motion and it varies\nslowly with time so that dc(t)/dt is indeed small. Now\nthe left-hand side of Eq. (11) becomes x-independent and\nthus the prefactor in front of cos \u03b8 at the right-hand side\nof Eq. (11) must be identically zero,\nHK \u2212\n\n2A\nc(t )2 + 4\u03c0Ms sin2 \u03c6 = 0\nMs\n\n(12)\n\nand\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ t\n\u03b8\nv (\u03c4 )d\u03c4 . (8)\nln tan = c(t ) x \u2212\n2\n0\n\nThe first equation assumes that the projection of the\nmagnetization vector in the domain wall on the yz plane\nis independent of the position. One should note that the\nspatial independence of \u03c6(t ) does not mean a uniform\nout-of-plane component because Mz = sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 and \u03b8\nvaries spatially in the domain wall from \u03b8 = 0 to \u03c0. The\nsecond equation in Eq. (8) postulates that the domain\nwall shape remains a standard N\u00e9el-wall form except that\nthe width of the wall W (t) \u2261 c(t )\u22121 varies with time and\nthe wall moves with an instantaneous velocity v (t ). As\nwe will show later that this form of the solution is indeed\na correct solution as long as the spin torque bJ and the\nexternal field Hext are small.\n\n\u22022\u03b8\n= c(t )2 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\u2202x2\n\u2202\u03b8\n= c1 (x, t ) sin \u03b8\n\u2202t\n\n\u03b1c(t)v(t) +\n\nd\u03c6\n= \u03b3Hext .\ndt\n\n(13)\n\nBy placing Eq. (13) into (10), we have\nd\u03c6\n= \u03b3Hext + \u03b1bJ c(t ) \u2212 4\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3Ms sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 .\ndt\n(14)\nEquations (12) and (14) are the ordinary first-order differential equations that determine the domain wall width\nc\u22121 (t) and the rotation of the domain wall plane \u03c6(t)\nsubject to the initial values \u03c6(t = 0) = 0 and c\u22121 (t =\n0) = 1/W0 . Once these two equations are solved, we can\nobtain the velocity of the domain wall from Eq. (13)\n(1 + \u03b12 )\n\nv (t ) =\n\n\u03b3(\u03b1Hext + 4\u03c0Ms sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6)\nbJ\n.\n\u2212\n(1 + \u03b12 )c(t )\n1 + \u03b12\n\n(15)\n\n\f4\nB.\n\nDomain wall distortion\n\nIn our analytical theory, domain wall distortion is characterized by two parameters, \u03c6(t) and c\u22121 (t). The former\ndescribes the out-of-plane component of the magnetization and the latter is the time-dependent domain wall\nwidth. When t \u2192 \u221e, the distortion is maximum. By\nplacing d\u03c6/dt = 0, we find \u03c6(\u221e) from Eq. (14) in the\nabsence of the external field,\nq\n4\u03c0M 2\nHK Ms\nb\n+ 2A s sin2 \u03c6(\u221e)\nJ\nbJ c(\u221e)\n2A\n=\n(17)\nsin 2\u03c6(\u221e) =\n2\u03b3\u03c0Ms\n2\u03b3\u03c0Ms\nwhere the\n\u221a last identity is from Eq. (12). When bJ\n(\u226a \u03b3W0 4\u03c0Ms HK ) is small, sin \u03c6 \u2248 \u03c6 and sin2 \u03c6 \u2248 0,\nEq. (17) is simplified as,\n\u03c6(\u221e) \u2248\n\nbJ\n.\n4\u03c0\u03b3Ms W0\n\n(18)\n\nBy inserting this into Eq. (12) and again by assuming bJ\nis small, we find the maximum reduction of the domain\nwall width is\nFIG. 2: The velocity v , the wall width W , the wall angle\n\u03c6 and the displacement x as a function of time t for different spin torques and for Hext = 0Oe. The parameters are\n4\u03c0Ms = 1.8 \u00d7 104 Oe, HK = 500Oe, Ms = 14.46 \u00d7 105 A/m,\nA = 2.0 \u00d7 10\u221211 J/m and \u03b1 = 0.02.\n\nW (\u221e)\n1\nb2J\n=1\u2212\nW0\n2W02 4\u03c0Ms HK \u03b3 2\n\nIn Fig. 2 (b) and (c), we show the domain wall distortion\nduring the application of the current.\nC.\n\nThe numerical solutions of Eq. (12) and (14) are represented in Fig. 2 where the domain wall velocity, displacement, and distortion as a function of time are shown. In\nthe following subsections, we discuss these quantities.\n\nA.\n\nDomain wall velocity\n\nAt t=0, the wall is a standard in-plane N\u00e9el wall, i.e.,\n\u03c6(t = 0) = 0. From Eq. (15), we have readily seen that\nthe velocity is \u2212bJ /(1 + \u03b12 ) at the initial application of\nthe current if no external field is applied. On the other\nhand, for t \u2192 \u221e, d\u03c6/dt = 0. We immediately find, from\nEq. (13),\nvs \u2261 v(\u221e) =\n\n\u03b3Hext\n;\nc(\u221e)\u03b1\n\n(16)\n\nthis result is same as that of Walker [20] in the absence of\nthe spin torque. We conclude that the terminal velocity\nis independent of the spin torque at all! This implies\nthat the spin current alone, i.e., no applied field, can not\nmove the domain wall to a large distance. In Fig.2(a),\nthe velocity of the domain wall during the application of\nthe current is shown. It is noted that the domain wall\nmotion stops at a fraction of a nanosecond.\n\n(19)\n\nDomain wall displacement\n\nAs the domain wall motion eventually stops even for\nthe perfect wire in the absence of the external field, it\nis interesting to see how far the domain wall moves, i.e.,\nwhat is the maximum distance a domain wall can travel\nbefore it stops? We estimate this displacement by integrating the velocity and utilizing Eqs. (12) and (13)\nxmax =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\nv dt = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c6(\u221e)\n\nbJ\nd\u03c6\n.\n\u2248\u2212\n\u03b1c\n4\u03c0\u03b3\u03b1Ms\n\n(20)\n\nNotice that the displacement is inversely proportional to\nthe damping constant. In Fig. 2(d), we show the displacement as a function of time.\nD.\n\nInductance of domain wall\n\nWe have seen that domain wall motion driven by the\ncurrent is so much different from that driven by an external field. In the latter case, the initial velocity upon\nthe application of the external field is small and the velocity is gradually increasing until a saturation velocity\nis reached; after that, the domain wall moves with a constant velocity. We can understand this field-driving wall\nmotion rather straightforwardly: the wall motion along\n\n\f5\nthe direction of the field is to reduce the Zeeman energy;\nthe rate of the Zeeman energy reduction equals to the\nenergy damping in a constant moving domain wall. For\nthe current-driving domain wall motion, the wall motion\ndoes not decrease the energy because the spin torque has\nno effect on the uniformly magnetized domains. Instead,\nthe application of the spin torque introduces energy to\nthe wall so that distortion of the wall occurs. The consequence of the wall distortion is to generate an energy\ndamping mechanism so that the pumping of the energy\nby the spin torque can be compensated by the damping. Once the dynamic equilibrium between pumping\nand damping is reached, the domain wall motion stops\nand the distortion is the maximum. To quantitatively\nsee this interesting feature, we consider the wall energy\n)\nZ \u221e (\n2\nH\nA\n\u2202M\nK\n2\u03c0Mz2 \u2212\nE=\nM2 +\ndx (21)\n2Ms x Ms2 \u2202x\n\u2212\u221e\nwhere the first term is magnetostatic energy, the second is\nthe anisotropy energy and the final term is the exchange\nenergy. The rate of the energy change can be obtained\nvia dE = \u2212Hef f * dM and use the LLG equation,\nZ \u221e\u001a\ndE\n\u03b3\u03b1 1\n|M \u00d7 Hef f |2\n=\n\u2212\ndt\n1\n+\n\u03b12 Ms\n\u2212\u221e\n\u001b\nbJ\n\u03b1 \u2202M\n\u2202M\nbJ\n\u2212\nHef f *\n\u2212\n* (Hef f \u00d7 M) dx\n1 + \u03b12\n\u2202x\n1 + \u03b12 Ms \u2202x\n(22)\nNote that the first term is a pure damping, the second\nand third terms are the result of the spin torque. By\ninserting the effective field Eq. (4), we can express above\ntwo equations in terms of the wall distortion parameters\n\u03c6(t) and c(t). The expression is algebraically tedious\nand lengthy; we do not write them down here. Instead,\nwe would simply consider limiting cases where the spin\ntorque is small. A straightforward calculation leads to\nsimple but insightful expressions for the rate of the energy\nchange and the wall energy,\ndE\n=\ndt\n\n16\u03bc0 \u03c0W0 Ms2\n3\n\nsin \u03c6 cos \u03c6\n\nd\u03c6\ndt\n\n(23)\n\nand\n\u2206E \u2261 E(bJ ) \u2212 E(0) =\n\n1\nLw b2J\n2\n\n(24)\n\nwhere we have defined the inductance of the domain wall\nLw = \u03c0/(3\u03bc0 \u03b3 2 W0 ). These expressions illustrate the energy process during the domain wall motion. The total\nspin current induced wall energy is proportional to the\nsquare of the current density -- an analogy to the inductance of a circuit.\nThe stored domain wall energy in the form of domain\nwall distortion can be released once the spin current is\nturned off -- an analogy to the electric discharge of inductance. In fact, we can easily show that the domain\n\nFIG. 3: Maximum wall width narrowing \u2206W/W0 and the\nmaximum angle \u03c6 as a function of the spin torque.\n\nwall will move back to its original location. To see this,\nwe set bJ = 0 in Eq. (15) and the velocity for Hext = 0\nis\nvrec (t ) =\n\n\u03b34\u03c0Ms sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6\n(1 + \u03b12 )c(t )\n\n(25)\n\nNoted that the initial condition is now \u03c6 = \u03c6(\u221e) and\nthe initial velocity is +bJ /(1 + \u03b12). By dropping the first\ntwo terms in the right hand side of Eq. (14), one can\nintegrate \u03c6(t) out from Eq. (14) and it is easy to check\nthat\nZ \u221e\nZ 0\nd\u03c6\nxrec \u2261\nvrec dt =\n= \u2212xmax\n(26)\n0\n\u03c6(\u221e) \u03b1c\nThe domain wall moves to its original position. Again,\nthis phenomenon is analogous to the discharge of an inductance in a usual electronic circuit. We will show in\nthe next Section how this feature differs from the domain\nwall motion when an external field is turned off.\n\nE.\n\nBeyond Walker's limit\n\nUp till now, our analysis is based on Walker's trial\nfunction. As in the case of field-driving domain wall motion, it is essential to assume that the deviation from the\noriginal N\u00e9el wall is small. This places the validity of our\nanalytical result to a small current density. In this subsection, we show that when the current density is larger\nthan a critical current, Walker's trial function fails to describe the domain wall motion. In fact, the domain wall\nwill not stop at a sufficient large current and the distortion of the domain wall can not be simply described by\ntwo parameters (\u03c6(t) and c(t)) anymore. Fortunately, for\nthe experimental interesting, the applied current density\nis usually within the applicability of the Walker's theory.\nTo find the critical current density, bc , we consider a\ntime independent solution by setting d\u03c6\ndt = 0 in Eq. (14).\n\n\f6\nBy using Eq. (12), we find\nbJ = q\n\n4\u03c0\u03b3Ms sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6\nHK Ms\n2A\n\n+\n\n4\u03c0Ms2\n2A\n\n(27)\n\n2\n\nsin \u03c6\n\nMaximizing bJ with respect to the angle \u03c6, we have\nHK\nsin2 \u03c6c =\n2HK + 4\u03c0Ms\np\nHK (HK + 4\u03c0Ms )\nsin \u03c6c cos \u03c6c =\n2HK + 4\u03c0Ms\n\n(28)\n(29)\n\nInserting Eqs. (28) and (29) back into Eq. (27), we find\nthe maximum spin torque for a stationary solution is\n\u221a\n4\u03c0\u03b3Ms HK + 4\u03c0Ms\nq\nbc =\n4\u03c0Ms2\nMs\n2\n2A (2HK + 4\u03c0Ms ) + 2A (2HK + 4\u03c0Ms )\n(30)\nwhen 4\u03c0Ms \u226b HK ,\nbc \u2248 4\u03c0\u03b3Ms \u03be\n\n(31)\n\np\n\nwhere \u03be = A/(4\u03c0Ms2 ) is the exchange length. Thus\nwhen bJ > bc , the stationary solution of Walker fails.\nOn the other hand, if the spin torque is smaller than\nbc , the maximum distortion shown in Eq. (28) is small\nand thus the Walker's trial function is valid. For a\nCo nanowire, 4\u03c0Ms = 1.8 \u00d7 104 Oe, HK = 500Oe,\n\u03b3 = 1.9 \u00d7 107 (Oe)\u22121 s\u22121 , Ms = 14.46 \u00d7 105 A/m and\nA = 2.0 \u00d7 10\u221211 J/m, the critical current is about bc =\n922m/s or jec = 2.2 \u00d7 1010 A/cm2 . This current density\nis at least one to two orders of magnitude larger than\ntypical experimental values and thus the trial function\nand its solutions are applicable to most of the experiments. In Fig. 3, we show the maximum deformation\nof the domain wall; even for the current density as high\nas 2 \u00d7 1010 A/cm2 , the maximum angle \u03c6 is about 8 degrees and the wall only shrinks by 22%. Thus we confirm\nthat the trial functions are the good approximation for\ndomain wall dynamics at least in one-dimension model\npresented in this section.\nIV.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nUp till now, our description of domain wall dynamics is\nbased on the assumption that the out-of-plane angle \u03c6 is\ntime-dependent but spatially independent. In a typical\nnanowire, the magnetization varies along the direction\nof the wire width, i.e., one may need to go beyond 1-d\nmodel. Furthermore, a realistic wire is expected to contain various pinning centers and it would be interesting to\nsee the effect of pinning on domain wall motion. In these\ncases, a micromagnetic calculation is required to quantitatively investigate the domain wall dynamics. Here we\ntake an example of a Co nanowire. To make our discussions concrete, we specify the wire dimension: the thickness is d = 5 nm, the width is D = 200 nm and the length\n\nFIG. 4: The snap shots of the moving magnetic wall at t =\n0.06ns in a Co nanowire. The damping constant \u03b1=0.1 and\nthe external field Hext = 0Oe.\n\nis 1.2 \u03bcm. Clearly, this choice preserves one-dimensional\nfeature of the wire because D is larger than the domain\nwall width of Co. The reason for choosing this example\nis to make this numerical calculation directly comparable\nwith the analytical results obtained in the last section.\nThe magnetic wire is divided into rectangular cells whose\ndimension is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5nm3 . For our film with the large\nwidth D, the magneto-dipolar interactions between the\ncells can be discarded. The wall dynamics was calculated\nusing a fourth order predictor-corrector method with an\n0.8 ps time step. The stationary N\u00e9el wall is centered at\nx = 0 at t = 0, a spin current is turned on along x direction, and the external field is applied along x direction\nat t > 0.\nIn presence of the spin torque, the magnetization of\ndomain wall is no more confined in the plane of the layer\nand the original N\u00e9el wall is distorted during the motion\nof the domain wall. In Fig. 4, we show snap shots of\nmagnetization patterns at t = 0.06 nanoseconds after a\ncurrent is turned at t = 0. For a small current density,\nthe shape of the N\u00e9el wall is essentially unchanged except\nwith a small out of plane magnetization, in consistence\nwith our analytical model in previous Section. When\nthe applied current is increased to values larger than the\ncritical current, the shape of the N\u00e9el wall is completely\ndestroyed. The magnetization inside the wall has developed a significant out-of-plane component, see Fig. 4b,\nand the wall has split into complicated multiple walls. In\nour calculation, the critical spin torque bc \u2248 1240m/s,\nwhich approximately agrees with our analytical result\nfrom Eq. (30). We now should confine our discussion below to the case where the current density is smaller than\nthe critical current. For a perfect wire, the N\u00e9el wall\nmoves with a velocity v = \u2212bJ immediately after the application of the current. In Fig. 5, we show wall positions\nat different times as well as wall velocity and wall distortion when wall moves to different positions. The domain\nwall remains to be a quasi-N\u00e9el wall and eventually the\nwall completely stops. At x = 0, the wall velocity is at\nthe maximum (vmax = 750m/s). When the wall stops,\nthe maximum out-of-plane component of the magnetiza-\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 5: (a) The wall positions at several time t = 0, 0.5ns,\n1.0ns, 1.5ns, 2.0ns, 2.5ns and n=3.0ns; (b) the wall velocity\nas a function of the wall position; (c) the maximum out-ofplane component of the magnetization as a function of the\nwall position.

The solid curves represent the analytical results and\nscattered points are the numerical solutions.\n\ntion (Mz -component) approaches (|Mz |/Ms = 0.1) and\nthe total displacement is xmax = 312nm.\nIt is interesting to take a look at the domain wall dynamics with simultaneous application of the current and\nthe external field. As we already pointed out that the\ninitial domain wall velocity is determined by the current but the final terminated velocity is controlled by\nthe external field, see Fig. 6. We confirm here that the\nspin torque alone is unable to move the domain wall\n\nover a long distance, see fig. 7(a). This feature is just\nopposite to domain wall motion driven by an external\nfield: at an initial application of the magnetic field, the\nwall velocity is small (in fact one can easily show it is\n\u03b1Hext W0 /(1 + \u03b12 ) from Eq. (15)), but it becomes faster\nand faster until it reaches a saturated speed from Eq. (16)\nat vs = \u03b3Hext W (\u221e)/\u03b1. The origin of this difference had\nbeen discussed in great length in the last section and\nwe again confirm that these conclusions remain valid for\nthe realistic wire. The fact, that the initial domain wall\nvelocity is determined by the current but the final terminated velocity is controlled by the external field, can be\nused to design the high/low-speed domain wall propagation by properly choosing the desired spin current density\n\n\f8\nand the magnetic field. For example, if we are to move\nthe domain wall by 75 nanometers, the magnetic field (10\nOe) alone will take 0.43 nanoseconds. With help of the\nspin torque bJ = \u2212800m/s, the same displacement can\nbe made in 0.11 nanoseconds and it takes 0.65 nanoseconds when bJ = 300m/s. These features are clearly illustrated in Fig. 7(b).\nWe show the rate of energy input of the domain wall\nduring the application of the spin torque in Fig. 8. The\nrate of energy pumping from the spin torque increases at\ninitial application of the spin current, then it develops\na maximum rate. After that, the rate decreases due to\nincrease of the damping. Finally, the energy pumping is\nexactly compensated by the damping and the wall motion\nstops.\nIt is interesting to compare our calculations with experiment [21] where a domain wall speed about 3m/s for\na current density 1.2 \u00d7 108 A/cm2 was observed. As we\nhave concluded that the spin torque alone is unable to\nmove the wall over long distance (1\u03bcm), the observed\ndomain wall velocity over large distance must be from\ntwo possible scenarios: 1) An additional magnetic field\ngenerated by the current (Oersted fields) was present in\nthe experiment. One just needs a very small magnetic\nfield to generate this low velocity domain wall motion.\nIn fact, one to two Oersted was sufficient and it was hard\nto rule out such small field in experiment. 2) There is\na possibility of other spin-current induced torque which\nhas different form as Eq. (2). Indeed, if one relaxes the\nadiabatic process that assumes the direction of the spin\npolarization of the current adiabatically follows the magnetization vector in the domain wall, one would generate other spin torque. The detail calculation of the spin\ntorque from non-adiabatic process is beyond scope of the\npresent work; we will defer to a future publication. Other\nexperiments [22, 23], reported that a magnetic field is\nalways required to move the wall over a long distance.\nThese experiments agree with our general conclusions.\nWe end the section by looking at two more interesting\nexamples. The first one is that the spin current is applied in the form of a pulse. If we applied a rectangular\npulsed spin current along x direction, what dynamic behaviors do the domain walls have? In Fig. 9, we show the\nevolution of velocity v (t) and displacement x(t) with the\npulsed spin toque and we compared them with the pulsed\nmagnetic field. Suppose the spin torque with the magnitude bJ = \u2212600m/s is turned on at t=0 and turned off\nat \u03c4 = 0.5ns. In the absence of the external field, the\ndomain wall moves back to its original location after the\ncurrent is turned off. This is again consistent with our\nanalytical result. However, for the field-driving domain\nwall motion, the domain wall continues to move in the\nforward direction after the field is turned off.\nAnother example is to model the effect of pinning centers in the domain wall motion. In realistic nanowires,\ndomain walls are not completely free to move. There are\nvarious pinning sources such as defects and roughness.\nWe introduced a pinning field, Hpin = V0 xH(\u03b6 \u2212 |x|)/\u03b6,\n\nFIG. 9: Velocity v and displacement x for a pulsed spin current (left panels) and for a pulsed magnetic field (right panels). The damping constant is \u03b1 = 0.02.\n\nFIG. 10: The phase boundary of pinning and depinning domain wall for two types of pinning centers, see text for the\ndefinition of the pinning parameters V0 and \u03b6. The external\nfield is applied along the \u2212x direction and the spin current\nis along +x direction at t = 0. The damping constant is\n\u03b1 = 0.02.\n\nwhere H(y) is the Heaviside step function, \u03b6 > 0 is the\ndistance from the domain wall center, x is the position.\nIn Fig. 10, we present the result for the critical magnetic field required to move the wall in the presence of\nthe defect. The role of the current is to first move the\ndomain wall out of the pinning center so that the critical\nmagnetic field required to move the wall is smaller.\n\n\f9\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have demonstrated in this paper that the domain\nwall motion driven by a spin current has many unique\nfeatures that do not exist in the conventional domain\nwall motion driven by a magnetic field. By solving the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation along with the current\ninduced spin torque, we summarize below our main findings that are supported by our analytical and numerical\nstudy: 1) the spin torque alone can move the domain\nwall, but the total displacement is limited, thus the spin\ntorque is not capable to move domain walls over a large\ndistance; 2) since the speed of the wall is large at an initial application of the spin torque, there is an advantage\nof the spin torque over the magnetic field for wall movement at short distance; 3) the domain wall is capable to\nstore current-induced energy and thus the energy process\nof the domain wall is very similar to the charge/discharge\n\n[1] J.
