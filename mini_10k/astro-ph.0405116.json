It has been hypothesised that powerful radio\ngalaxies may represent a means to the discovery of\nhigh-redshift clusters of galaxies (e.g Le F\u00e8vre et al.\n1996, Fabian et al. 2001) through their X-ray emission. The new X-ray satellites allow us to test this hypothesis. Several mechanisms are responsible for the\nX-ray emission from radio galaxies. Thermal emission\nfrom a hot atmosphere surrounding the galaxy gives\ninformation about the large scale gas distribution and\nthe interaction between the expanding radio source and\nthe confining medium. Unresolved emission from the\nAGN, which can be thermal or non-thermal, probes\nthe physics near the central engine. The radio jet and\nlobes, which also emit in X-rays by the IC and/or synchrotron processes, allow us to put constraints on the\nenergy budget. In this paper, we present results from\nXMM-Newton observations of three high-redshift radio\ngalaxies. These high-sensitivity data allow us spectrally and spatially to separate different components,\nand to use the comparison of X-ray and radio data to\nconstrain the physics of the radio galaxies and their environment. In this work we adopt a cosmology with H0\n= 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7. If not otherwise stated, errors are quoted at 1\u03c3 confidence level.\n\nWe present results on the physical states of three highredshift powerful radio galaxies (3C 292 at z = 0.7,\n3C 184 at z = 1, and 3C 322 at z = 1.7). They were\nobtained by combining radio measurements with X-ray\nmeasurements from XMM-Newton that separate spectrally and/or spatially radio-related and hot-gas X-ray\nemission. Originally observed as part of a programme\nto trace clusters of galaxies at high redshift, none of the\nsources is found to lie in a rich X-ray-emitting environment similar to those of some powerful radio galaxies\nat low redshift, although the estimated gas pressures\nare sufficient to confine the radio lobes. The weak gas\nemission is a particularly interesting result for 3C 184,\nwhere a gravitational arc is seen, suggesting the presence of a very massive cluster. Here Chandra data\ncomplement the XMM-Newton measurements in spatially separating X-ray extended emission from that associated with the nucleus and rather small radio source.\n3C 292 is the source for which the X-ray-emitting gas\nis measured with the greatest accuracy, and its temperature of 2 keV and luminosity of 6.5 1043 erg s\u22121 are\nboth characteristic of a poor cluster. This source allows\nthe most accurate measurement of inverse-Compton\nX-ray emission associated with the radio lobes.

The background screening leaves 20 useful ks for scientific analysis. The XMM-Newton observation of 3C 322 was obtained in May 2002 and was\n\nIntroduction\n\nPowerful radio galaxies are visible to high redshift\nand hence can be used as tracers of large-scale struc1\n\n\f2 X-Ray and Radio Connections\n\nhttp://www.aoc.nrao.edu/events/xraydio\n\nhighly contaminated by background flares, which reduce the useful exposure time to 10 ks.\nAll radio data used in this analysis are from the NRAO\nVery Large Array (VLA), and with the exception of the\nlow-resolution map of 3C 292 the maps were made by\nus within AIPS in the standard manner. Observations\nfor 3C 292 are at 1.4 GHz (Array A) and at 8.5 GHz\n(Array C). We used 1.4 GHz and 4.87 GHz archive\ndata (Array A) for 3C 322.\nFor the three sources we performed a spatial and spectral analysis. We minimised particle contamination by\nlimiting the spectral range for the radial profile analysis to 0.2-2.5 keV. This selection criterion should\nalso reduce the amount that the wings of the central\npoint source contaminates the extended emission, if\nthe source displays a hard spectrum. The point-source\ncomponent was modelled with and analytical function\nof the Point Spread Function (PSF) for each instrument. Cluster components were modelled with a \u03b2model convolved with the PSF. Spectra were extracted\nfrom vignetting corrected events lists, because this allows us to use the central response file and effective\narea for each camera. Since all three sources are small\nrelative to the EPIC field of view, we took local background estimates. Moreover, all spectral components\nused to fit the data were assumed to be absorbed by the\nGalactic column in the direction of each source.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nResults\n3C 184\n\nThe X-ray image displays a rather compact emission,\nwith some indication of extended emission at least out\nto 40 arcsec. The radio source is very small (6 \u00d7 2\narcsec) and the core of the radio source coincides with\nthe peak of the X-ray emission in the whole energy\nband.\nWe extracted a radial profile of the source, which suggests extended emission out to \u223c 88 arcsec (700 kpc).\nThe MOS radial profile is well fitted with a point\nsource plus a \u03b2-model of \u03b2=0.66 and core radius rc =\n125 kpc. From the \u03b2-model fit and assuming kT \u223c 3.5\nkeV we estimate a bolometric LX = 6.4 \u00d7 1043 erg\ns\u22121 . The external pressure at the radio lobes (6 arcsec)\nis \u2243 3.0 \u00d7 10\u221212 Pa.\nThe X-ray spectrum is best fitted with a threecomponent model. The first component is given by a\nsoft power law of photon index \u0393 = 1.5, representing\n\nSanta Fe NM, 3-6 February 2004\n\nFigure 1: Radial profile obtained from the MOS1 camera\nin the energy range 0.2 -2.5 keV. The dark grey lines corresponds to the respective contribution of the pointlike model\nand the \u03b2-model. The best-fitting, combined model is plotted in black on the data points. The lower panel shows the\nresiduals in terms of \u03c7.\n\nemission from the lobes and hotspots. The best fit parameters of this non-thermal component were derived\nusing the higher spatial resolution, 20 ks Chandra observation (see Belsole et al. 2004). With this model,\nwe find a 1 keV X-ray flux density in the lobes of 0.2\nnJy, in agreement with the prediction from SSC and IC\nscattering of the CMB and iR photons for a source in\nequipartition.\nThe second component is represented by an absorbed\nhard power law with photon index \u0393 = 1.35 and\nNH = 4.9 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 , and finally we include a thermal component of kT = 3.6 keV.\nWe conclude that half of the X-ray emission of 3C 184\ncomes from an absorbed component which is associated with the central AGN. Some of the soft emission\nis radio related and produced by IC scattering. Most of\nthe emission at low energy is thermal and associated\nwith a cluster environment of kT = 3.6 keV and bolometric LX = 8.4 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 (spatial and spectral\nresults agree within the uncertainties). The cluster external pressure is insufficient to confine the lobes of the\nradio galaxy which will continue to expand.\nFurther support for the existence of a cluster environment comes from the detection of an arc with the HST\n\n\fX-Ray and Radio Connections\n\nhttp://www.aoc.nrao.edu/events/xraydio\n\nSanta Fe NM, 3-6 February 2004 3\n\nFigure 2: Background subtracted spectrum and folded\nmodel of the central 40 arcsec of 3C 184. The pn is in grey,\nthe MOS in black. \u03c7 deviation from the model is in the\nbottom panel.\n\n(Deltorn et al. 1997), suggesting a virial mass of 7.7\n1014 h\u22121\n70 M\u2299 . If we adopt the proton density calculated from the \u03b2-model, we estimate a gas-mass within\na cylinder of radius 5 arcsec (the distance of the arc)\nintegrated along the line of sight of \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 .\nWe compared this value with the total mass calculated\nin the same cylinder (and scaled for our cosmology) of\nDeltorn et al. (1997), e.g. \u223c (2.1 \u00b1 0.9)1013 M\u2299 , and\nfound a gas-mass to total-mass ratio of order 0.01. This\nis at least a factor of 10 lower than that observed for\nclusters of galaxies at lower redshift. Errors on this estimate are large, and the largest uncertainty is likely to\ncome from the \u03b2-model parameters. The best estimate\nfor the core-radius seems to suggest a rather shallow\npotential well with respect to other clusters at the same\nredshift (e.g. Vikhlinin et al. 2002). Since the spectral\nfit also implies an under-luminous object, we can speculate that the cluster around 3C 184 is somehow peculiar in its relatively high temperature but low luminosity (and low gas fraction) if compared to lower redshift\ngalaxy clusters. The fact that the radio source is small\nand young and expanding might explain the unusually\nhigh temperature of the external environment (see also\nCroston et al. 2004, this meeting).\n3.2\n\n3C 292\n\nThe image shows extended X-ray emission, mainly\naligned with the radio lobes, but less extended in the\nX-ray than in the radio (1.4 GHz). A radial profile fitting (excluding the lobes) gives \u03b2=0.8, rc =19.7 arcsec\n(140 kpc) and a central intensity of I0 =2.3 10\u22125 pn-\n\nFigure 3: XMM/EPIC adaptive smoothed image of 3C 292.\nContours are from the VLA 1.4 GHz image.\n\ncnts s\u22121 arcsec\u22122 .\nWe extracted the spectrum from the core, the lobes and\nlarge scale emission (see Fig. 4).

However some\ndoubts arise about interpreting the structures as pure\nnon-thermal emission since a thermal model of kT =\n5.2 keV is also a good fit.

The large-scale thermal emission indicates the\npresence of a poor cluster with kT =2.2 keV. The external pressure at the radio lobes is P = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u221213 Pa,\nwhich is somewhat low, but consistent with the source\nbeing in equilibrium with the external medium.\n3.3 3C 322\n\nFigure 4: Top: Data and model for the core region of\n3C 292. The model is an absorbed power law. Center: Data\nand model for the radio lobe region. The model displayed\nhere consists of a power law absorbed by Galactic absorption. Bottom: Data and model for the extended emission\nregion, after masking the radio lobe region with two sectors. The model here is a MEKAL of temperature 2.2 keV\nplus an absorbed power law. MOS data points are in black,\npn in grey.\n\nThe smoothed image (Fig. 5) is a 10 ks observation,\nwith very high background. We detect only 50 net\ncounts from the source. To the north, the radio emission is more extended than the X-ray. Under the hypothesis that all the photons correspond to the emission\nfrom a cluster-like environment we estimate an upper\nlimit for the expected luminosity of any thermal, extended emission of LX = 5 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 (assuming\nkT = 4 keV to match the LX \u2212 T relation of Vikhlinin\net al. 2002)\nWe obtain rough spectral informations from the 50\ncounts. A power law of photon index \u0393 = 1.6 gives\na good fit (Cash statistics were used). Adopting this\nmodel - thus ignoring any thermal contribution-, the\nmeasured flux density at 1 keV is 1.4 nJy, in very good\nagreement with the predictions for SSC and IC scattering of the CMB derived from radio data, assuming\nequipartition between the electrons and magnetic field.\n\n\fX-Ray and Radio Connections\n\n4\n\nhttp://www.aoc.nrao.edu/events/xraydio\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWe have undertaken an analysis of the X-ray emission from 3 high redshift radio galaxies. Core emission from an AGN is detected for two of them. X-ray\nemission associated with the radio lobes is spectrally\nfound for the three sources. For 3C 184 and 3C 292\nwe also found cluster like emission of kT =3.6 keV\nand 2.2 keV, respectively. Neither of them corresponds\nto a particularly rich cluster, in contrast to some lowerredshift radio galaxies such as Cyg A (Smith et al.\n2002) and Hydra A (Nulsen et al. 2002). Adopting our\nbest estimates for the lobe IC emission, the lobes in all\nthree sources are found to be consistent with equipartition within the uncertainties. The results are described\nin more detail in Belsole et al. (2004).\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the organisers of the conference for allowing\nus to present this work and for the successful organisation of the meeting. E.B. acknowledges support from\nPPARC.
