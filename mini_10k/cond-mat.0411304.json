Unlike other\nlaws of physics, the second law is an inequality, whose\ngenerality rests on there not being macroscopic violations of that inequality. Inequalities is a well-established\nbranch of mathematics [1], and it would be of interest\nto show that the laws of thermodynamics can be derived\nfrom well-known inequalities.\nCarath\u00e9odory's formulation of the second law, in its\nmost general nonstatical form [2], states that in every\nneighborhood of any given state, there exists adiabatically inaccessible states even when nonstatical processes\nare permitted. If we envision an entropy change, \u2206S, in\nwhich dQ = 0 (adiabatic), and at constant volume, the\nentropy of the system can only increase or decrease. Since\nthis is true no matter what the initial state is, it must be\nalways increase or always decrease. In order to determine\nwhich of the two possibilities is the correct one, recourse\nmust be made to experiment-albeit a single experiment\nsuffices.\nIt would be more gratifying if the entropy change\ncould be determined by a mathematical inequality, that\nwould be independent of any particular process or type\nof substance considered. In a little known paper, Cashwell and Everett [3] do just this without exploiting the\nfull impact of their findings. What they do is to show\nthat the final mean temperature of order-q in an energyconserving equilibration is necessarily greater than the\nmean of order-(q \u2212 r), where q > r, of an entropyconserving equilibration. Thus, the increase in entropy\nis due to the property that power means are increasing\nfunctions of their order [4].\nIn a series of papers, Landsberg [5], and Landsberg\nand Pe\u010dari\u010d [6], rediscover the Cashwell-Everett results\nin the case of constant, but not necessarily positive, heat\n\ncapacities. Both Cashwell-Everett and Landsberg were\nanteceded by Sommerfeld [7] who derived the arithmeticgeometric mean inequality for the temperature from the\nsecond law as an exercise. Sidhu [8] generalized Landsberg's result to arbitrary power means of order-q > 1, or,\nequivalently, to systems whose heat capacities are some\npositive power of the temperature. Negative orders were\nexcluded on the basis that it would contradict the third\nlaw of thermodynamics.\nFrom a mathematical viewpoint, there is no qualitative distinction between the arithmetic mean, q = 1, and\npower means, q > 1. However, there is a thermodynamic\ndistinction insofar as the former applies to an ideal classical gas (ICG), while the later to an ideal quantum gas\n(IQG).\nOur starting point will be the purely mechanical equation of state [9, 10]\nr\nU,\n(1)\npV =\nq\u2212r\nwhich we will assume to hold for IQG, although a formally analogous relation will appear for ICG, where p is\nthe pressure, V the volume of the container, and U the\ninternal energy. r and q are positive rational numbers,\nwhere q > r.\nDifferentiating (1) with respect to V , at a constant\nempirical temperature t, and using a combination of the\nGibbs equation and a Maxwell relation result in\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr\n\u2202U\n\u2202p\n+p =\nV\n\u2202V t\nq \u2212 r \u2202V t\n\u001a \u0012 \u0013\n\u001b\n1\n\u2202p\n=\nt\n\u2212 rp .\nq\u2212r\n\u2202t V\nThis partial differential equation has the general solution\nr\nV \u2212q/(q\u2212r) Z(z),\np=\nq\u2212r\nor, equivalently,\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: bernard.lavenda@unicam.it\n\nU = V \u2212r/(q\u2212r) Z(z),\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\non the strength of (1), where z = tV 1/(q\u2212r) .\nAt this point we can impose the property of homogeneity of the internal energy by requiring\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202p\n= 0,\n(3)\n\u2202V t\nwhich, in view of (1), implies that U is first-order homogeneous. It will be appreciated that (3) is a condition\nfor phase equilibrium. Varying the volume at constant\ntemperature leaves the vapor pressure constant by having the liquid evaporate or the vapor condense. This fine\nbalance keeps the pressure constant and preserves the\nhomogeneity of the internal energy. Moreover, it determines Z = z q , where we take the constant of proportionality equal to unity for simplicity sake. The condition of\nfirst-order homogeneity is, however, not necessary.\nFrom (2) we can write\nU V r/(q\u2212r) = z \u03b1 = t\u03b1 V \u03b1/(q\u2212r) =: Z(z),\n\n(4)\n\nby assuming a power expression for Z(z). The particular\nchoice, q = \u03b1, renders the internal energy homogeneous,\nand the system extensive.\nSolving for U ,\nU = t\u03b1 V (\u03b1\u2212r)/(q\u2212r) ,\n\n(5)\n\nand using (1) give\np=\n\nr \u03b1 (\u03b1\u2212q)/(q\u2212r)\nt V\n.\nq\u2212r\n\n(6)\n\nThe analogy with the Joule-Thomson effect will help clarify the role of the exponents. The condition that the\nentropy be an exact differential is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nt \u2202V\n\u2202H\n=V \u2212\n=: Cp \u03bc,\n(7)\n\u2202p t\nr \u2202t p\nwhere H is the enthalphy [cf. (14) below], and Cp is\nthe heat capacity at constant pressure. Using (6), we\nevaluate the Joule-Thomson coefficient, \u03bc, as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq \u03b1\u2212r\n\u03bcCp =\nV,\n(8)\nr \u03b1\u2212q\nsince\n\u0012\n\n\u2202V\n\u2202t\n\n\u0013\n\np\n\nV\n=\u2212\nt\n\n\u0012\n\nq\u2212r\n\u03b1\u2212q\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nWhen \u03b1 > q, \u03bc is positive and there is a cooling effect.\nAlternatively, when q > \u03b1 > r, \u03bc is negative and there\nis a heating effect. When the system is extensive, \u03b1 = q,\n(8) implies that Cp = \u221e. The inversion point occurs\nwhen \u03b1 = r. For an extensive system, (3) shows that the\npressure depends only on the temperature, and is independent of the volume. Since constant pressure implies\nconstant temperature, when heat is added to the system\n\nthe temperature must remain fixed, and only the volume\ncan change. This implies Cp = \u221e for all extensive IQG.\nWhen the internal energy (5) is not a linear function\nof the empirical temperature alone, the gas and absolute\ntemperature scales do not coincide. For an ICG, the\nconstant of proportionality between the internal energy\nand the empirical temperature is some multiple of the\nnumber of particles, N , which is a constant. Rather,\nfor an IQG, the number of particles is variable, being a\nfunction of the temperature.\nThe only thing that the zeroth law demands is that the\nempirical temperature be the same when two systems arrive in a state of mutual thermal equilibrium. Once the\nempirical scale has been chosen, the absolute temperature must be a monotonically increasing function of it,\nsay T (t) = tr for r > 0.\nIn order to render the increment in the heat,\ndQ = dU + p dV\nr \u03b1\u2212r\n\n= \u03b1t z\n\n(10)\n\nd log z = \u03b1V\n\n\u2212r/(q\u2212r) \u03b1\n\nz d log z,\n\na perfect differential, we may either divide through by tr\nto obtain\n\u0011 dQ\n\u0010\n\u03b1\n(11)\nd t\u03b1\u2212r V (\u03b1\u2212r)/(q\u2212r) = r =: dS,\n\u03b1\u2212r\nt\n\nor multiply through by V r/(q\u2212r) to get\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd t\u03b1 V \u03b1/(q\u2212r) = V r/(q\u2212r) dQ =: dZ.\n\n(12)\n\n\u03b1 \u03b1\u2212r\n\u03b1 \u03b1\u2212r (\u03b1\u2212r)/(q\u2212r)\nz\n=\nt\nV\n,\n\u03b1\u2212r\n\u03b1\u2212r\n\n(13)\n\nThe potential (4) is a higher power of z than the entropy,\nS=\n\nwhich becomes extensive when \u03b1 = q. Since\nH = U + pV =\n\nq \u03b1 (\u03b1\u2212r)/(q\u2212r)\nt V\n,\nq\u2212r\n\nthe difference between (14) and tr times (13),\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq \u03b1 q\u2212r\nG = U + pV \u2212 tr S =\npV,\n\u2212\nr\nr \u03b1\u2212r\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nshows that the Gibbs free energy, G, is a measure of\nthe degree of nonextensivity. It is well known that (9)\ndiverges when the chemical potential is identically zero\n[10, p. 229]. This occurs for an extensive IQG.\nFor a nonrelativistic IQG, irrespective of whether it\nobeys Bose or Fermi statistics, \u03b1 = q, q/r = 25 , and we\nshall set r = 1 in order to make the comparison with conventional formulas as close as possible. Apart from constant factors, U = T 5/2 V , and Z = V 2/3 U = T 5/2 V 5/3 .\nSince the latter must be a power of z = T V 2/3 only, U\ncannot contain any arbitrary constants. Conventionally,\nsuch an arbitrary constant is identified with the chemical\n\n\f3\npotential at absolute zero. Since conventional IQG are\nextensive, the chemical potential vanishes identically on\naccount of (15).\nIn an adiabatic process, the entropy S = 53 z 3/2 =\n5 3/2\nT V , and the potential, Z = z 5/2 = 23 pV 5/3 , are con3\nstant. The pressure, p = 23 T 5/2 , is independent of the\nvolume, and satisfies the homogeneity condition, (3).\nA new adiabatically conserved potential, (4), has appeared, for which the cell size, R = V 1/(q\u2212r) , raised to\nthe power r, is the integrating factor for the heat,\nRr dQ = dZ,\nwhich puts it on par with that of the second law, (11).\nSince both (4) and (13) are constant for adiabatic processes, they provide no criterion for the accessibility of\nstates under adiabatic transitions. For processes of pure\nheat conduction, U - and Z-conservation equilibrations\ngive the greatest mean temperature possible, and the\nevolution is determined by the second law, because the\npower means are monotonic increasing functions of their\norder. However, for processes involving pure deformations, U - and Z-conservation equilibriations will not be\nequivalent.\nConsider a system comprised of n cells, adiabiatically\nisolated from the environment. Initially the walls of the\ncells are rigid and adiabatic. When the walls are replaced\nby deformable, diathermal ones, there will be probabilities, pi that the cells will have linear dimensions, Ri\nand temperatures, ti . Probabilities enter naturally when\ndealing with processes of heat exchange: Heat is the uncontrollable form of work [11], and temperature is its\nmeasure.\nCarath\u00e9odory's principle says that states arbitrarily\nnear to one another may be adiabatically inaccessible; it\ndoes not say what those states are. This must come from\nan additional assumption that only those states that are\nadiabatically accessible from a given state are those for\nwhich the internal energy increases [12],\nZ Vf\nn\nX\nr\n\u03b1\n\u2206U = \u2212\nV \u2212q/(q\u2212r) dV\npi\nz\nq \u2212 r i=1\nVi\n)\n(\nn\nX\n\u2212r/(q\u2212r)\n\u2212r/(q\u2212r)\n\u03b1\npi Vi\nVf\n\u2212\n= z\ni=1\n\n= const. \u00d7\n\n(\n\ntrf \u2212\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\npi tri\n\n)\n\n\u2265 0,\n\n(16)\n\nby the work that must be done. The last line follows from\nthe condition of adiabaticity, z = tV 1/(q\u2212r) = const. Inequality (16) asserts that adiabatic transitions to neighboring states are possible so long as the final temperature is greater than the mean temperature, t(r) =\nPn\n1/r\n( i=1 pi tri ) .\nThis is tantamount to requiring the final mean vol\u0011\u2212(q\u2212r)/r\n\u0010P\n\u2212r/(q\u2212r)\nn\nume to be greater than\n. In\np\nV\ni=1 i i\n\nan adiabatic, energy-conserving equilibration, the final\nmean volume,\nn\nX\n\nVf =\n\n\u2212r/(q\u2212r)\npi Vi\n\ni=1\n\n!\u2212(q\u2212r)/r\n\n\u2192 Vmin ,\n\nin the limit as q \u2192 r, where Vmin is the smallest cell volume. The final mean volume, Vf , is a decreasing function\nof its order. On account of the adiabatic constraint, the\nmean temperature is the highest mean temperature, t(q).\nThe smaller the difference, q \u2212r, the more weight is given\nto smaller cell volumes.\nAlternatively, if no work is performed, the average\nchange in the internal energy cannot increase,\n\u2206U = V \u03b1\u2212r)/(q\u2212r)\n\nn\nX\n\npi\n\ni=1\n\n= V\n\n(\u03b1\u2212r)/(q\u2212r)\n\n(\n\nt\u03b1\nf\n\nZ\n\ntf\n\ndt\u03b1\n\nti\n\n\u2212\n\nn\nX\n\np i t\u03b1\ni\n\ni=1\n\n)\n\n\u2264 0,\n\n(17)\n\nin a process involving only pure thermal conduction. This\nsays that the final common mean temperature of the\ncells cannot be greater than the mean temperature, t(\u03b1),\nwhich is the greatest mean temperature in nonextensive\nsystems with \u03b1 > q. Inequality (17) can be related to\nJensen's inequality, and constitutes a criterion for spontaneous transition [13]. Consequently, \u2206U = 0 coincides\nwith \u2206Z = 0 for processes in which no work is done,\nwhere the highest final mean temperature is reached.\nContrarily, the largest mean volume coincides with\nthe largest cell volume, Vmax , in an isothermal energyconserving equilibration in the same limit as q \u2193 r.\nThe energy equilibriating conservation condition for an\nisothermal process gives the final mean volume\nVf =\n\nn\nX\n\n(\u03b1\u2212r)/(q\u2212r)\npi Vi\n\ni=1\n\n!(q\u2212r)/(\u03b1\u2212r)\n\n\u2192 Vmax\n\n(18)\n\nin the limit as q \u2192 r if \u03b1 > q. The final volume is now\nan increasing function of its order. The larger the order,\nthe more weight is given to larger cell volumes Vi .\nThe final mean volume in a Z-conserving equilibration,\nVf =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03b1/(q\u2212r)\npi Vi\n\n!(q\u2212r)/\u03b1\n\n,\n\nwill be greater than in a U -conserving equilibration, (18),\nbut will tend to the same value, Vmax , in the limit as q \u2193 r.\nThe limit q \u2193 r will be shown to be the transition from\nan IQG to an ICG in nonextensive systems with \u03b1 > q,\nor extensive systems in general. In that limit, an adiabatic transition corresponds to the smallest volume, while\nan isothermal transition corresponds to the greatest final\nvolume. Hence, adiabatic to isothermal changes cover the\n\n\f4\nentire spectrum of mean values of the volume, analogous\nto a polytrope, where adiabats and isotherms correspond\nto zero and infinite heat capacities, respectively.\nIf the temperatures and sizes of the cells are similarly\nordered, so that cells of higher temperatures have larger\nsizes, in compliance with Charles' law,\nn\nX\n\nz(q) =\n\npi tqi Riq\n\ni=1\n\nn\nX\n\n=\n\npi tqi\n\ni=1\n\n!1/q\n\n!1/q\n\ni=1\n\n> t(q)R(q)\n\nn\nX\n\npi Riq\n\ni=1\n\n!1/q\n\n,\n\n(19)\n\nunless all the temperatures, ti , and cell sizes, Ri , are\nequal. If there is some constraint that makes the temperatures decreasing functions of the cell sizes, then the discrete analog of \u010chebyshev's inequality, (19), is reversed\n[1, pp. 43\u201344].\nIt therefore follows that the terms in the hierarchy\nzh > z(q) > z(q \u2212 r) > z(r) > zc ,\nare greater than the corresponding terms in the hierarchy\nth Rmax > t(q)R(q) > t(q\u2212r)R(q\u2212r) > t(r)R(r) > tc Rmin .\nThis is implied by the hierarchy\nth > t(q) > t(q \u2212 r) > t(r) > tc ,\nin the case of pure thermal conduction, or, in the case of\nan isothermal process by\nRmax > R(q) > R(q \u2212 r) > R(r) > Rmin ,\nwhere Rmax and Rmin are the largest and smallest cell\nlengths, respectively.\nIn a Z-equilibrating conservation,\nZ zf\nn\nn\nX\nX\npi zi\u03b1 = 0,\n(20)\ndZ(z) = zf\u03b1 \u2212\npi\n\u2206Z =\ni=1\n\nzi\n\ni=1\n\nimposing zf = z(\u03b1).

Here,\nwe show that the transition takes place in the limit as\n\u03b1 \u2193 r. In this limit (21) becomes indeterminate, of the\nform 0/0.

The second law inequality now follows\nfrom the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality [7], implying that the maximum amount of work has been done\nin going from the initial state, characterized by the mean\nenergy, u(1), to the final state, with energy u(0).\nThe ICG limit also allows a connection to be made with\nmultifractals and information theory [15], in the isothermal processes occurring in nonextensive systems.

Multiplying (26) through by pi , summing, and\nintroducing the result into (23) give\n\u2206S = (\u03b1 \u2212 1) (S1 \u2212 S\u03b1 ) > 0,\n\nn\nX\n1\np\u03b1\nlog\ni ,\n1\u2212\u03b1\ni=1\n\nThis can be obtained by averaging\n\nR\n\nD\u03b1\n\n=\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nentropies of order 1 and \u03b1, respectively. The inequality in\n(27) is due to the fact that for \u03b1 > 1 the Shannon entropy\nis greater than the R\u00e9nyi entropy, while, for \u03b1 < 1, the\nconverse is true. Hence, the second law (27) is always\nsatisfied.
