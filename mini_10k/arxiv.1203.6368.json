INTRODUCTION\n\nThe\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich\n(SZ)\neffect\n(Sunyaev & Zeldovich 1980) is the principal source\nof CMB temperature anisotropy power at angular scales\nsmaller than a few arcminutes. It comprises of two\ncomponents, known as the 'thermal' and 'kinetic' effects.\nThe former arises from inverse Compton scattering of\nCMB photons off hot electrons pervading galaxy cluster\nenvironments, distorting the Planckian form of the\nCMB spectrum. The kinetic SZ effect is caused by\nthe Doppler shifting of CMB photons via Thomson\nscattering off clouds of electrons with a non-zero bulk\nvelocity (along the line-of-sight) relative to the CMB rest\nframe. Recently, both the South Pole Telescope (SPT,\nLueker et al. 2010; Shirokoff et al. 2011; Reichardt et al.\n2011) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT,\nFowler et al. 2010; Dunkley et al. 2011) have placed constraints on the amplitudes of the kinetic and thermal SZ\ncontributions to the small-scale CMB power spectrum.\nFor instance, Reichardt et al. (2011) measured the\nthermal SZ amplitude at 150 Ghz to be 3.69 \u00b1 0.65\u03bcK2\nand placed an upper limit on the kSZ amplitude of\n< 2.8\u03bcK2 (at 95% confidence and assuming no SZ-point\nsource correlation).\nMeasurements of the thermal SZ power spectrum\nprobe the abundance-weighted pressure profiles of hot\ngas in groups and clusters over a wide range of redshifts. This is interesting in a cosmological context\nbecause the dependence on the abundance of clusters\n(7\u22129)\nproduces a sensitive scaling with \u03c38 ; i.e., Cl \u221d \u03c38\n(Komatsu & Seljak 2002; Trac et al. 2011; Shaw et al.\n2010, denoted as S10 hereafter). However, efforts to\nconstrain \u03c38 in this way have been inhibited by a large\n\ntheoretical uncertainty on the amplitude of the tSZ\nsignal (for a fixed cosmological model). Precise predictions of the SZ power spectrum have been hampered by the uncertainties in modeling the state of\nthe intra-cluster medium (ICM) over a broad range\nof mass and redshift, and at large cluster-centric radii\n(Battaglia et al. 2010; Trac et al. 2011, S10). Early models and simulations produced predictions for the amplitude of the thermal SZ power spectrum that are discrepant with recent measurements by more than a factor of 2 (Lueker et al. 2010). Recent work, using hydrodynamical simulations (Battaglia et al. 2010, 2011), Nbody simulations+semi-analytic gas models (Trac et al.\n2011) and analytic models (S10, Efstathiou & Migliaccio\n2011; Chaudhuri & Majumdar 2011), have significantly\nreduced the tension between the observed and predicted\nvalues. However the distribution of amplitudes between\ndifferent models and simulations is still significantly\nlarger than the measurement errors (Reichardt et al.\n2011), degrading the constraints that can be placed on\ncosmological parameters. Furthermore, as current experiments do not cover a sufficiently broad frequency range\nto enable the tSZ and kSZ signals to be distinguished\nspectrally, the kSZ contribution must currently be modeled and subtracted from the total SZ power, providing\nan additional source of systematic uncertainty.\nIn this work we propose the SZ bispectrum as a new,\nrobust method for constraining the thermal SZ amplitude. The bispectrum, or its real-space counterpart, the\n3-point function, is widely used to measure the deviation of a signal from Gaussianity both in the CMB and\nin large scale structure data. The bispectrum in the\nCMB map can be measured by using three CMB tem-\n\n\f2\n\nBhattacharya et. al.\n\nperature values and taking the average over the survey\nsky. The primordial CMB bispectrum can be used to\nsearch for signatures of primordial non-Gaussian fluctuations (see e.g., Komatsu et al. 2011, and references\ntherein). The dominant secondary anisotropy signals in\nthe CMB temperature power spectrum arise from lensing\nof the CMB by large-scale structure, the ISW effect and\nthe SZ effect. These signals, either alone or from their\ncross correlation, give rise to a measurable bispectrum\n(Cooray 2000; Komatsu & Spergel 2001; Cooray & Hu\n2000). The full non-Gaussian information (primordial or\nfrom low-redshift structure) can be obtained by Fourier\ntransforming the CMB temperature field and taking the\nproduct of three temperature values that form a triangle,\nthen summing over all possible triangle configurations in\nharmonic space, assuming all harmonic modes forming\nthe triangles are independent.\nOne can also measure a skewness spectrum in which\ntwo sides of the triangle are summed over to measure the skewness as a function of the third side\n(Munshi & Heavens 2010). The total skewness spectrum in a CMB map consists of that generated by CMB\nlensing, the thermal and the kinetic SZ effects, point\nsources, a signal arising due to the cross correlation of\nthese components, and any primordial contribution. A\nsignificant fraction of the kinetic SZ power spectrum is\ngenerated by Gaussian density fluctuations in the linear\nregime (Shaw et al. 2011). Although patchy reionization\nmay contribute a significant fraction of the kSZ spectrum (Mesinger et al. 2012), it is reasonable to expect\nthat the kinetic SZ bispectrum is very small \u2013 the overall\nkSZ amplitude is 50-75% smaller than the tSZ. The SZ\nskewness spectrum is thus likely to be dominated by the\nthermal SZ effect. As the primary CMB power decreases\nrapidly at l > 2000, the CMB lensing bispectrum should\nalso becomes negligible at high l. Cooray et al. (2000)\nhave shown that the SZ skewness can be measured using the Planck data with a S/N\u224810, assuming a perfect\nsubtraction of the primary CMB and other foregrounds.\nIn this work, we focus on the SZ bispectrum, showing\nthat it can provide information complementary to that\nfrom the SZ power spectrum. First, as the SZ skewness spectrum is dominated by the thermal SZ component it does not suffer from the observed thermal-kinetic\nSZ degeneracy. A combination of the SZ skewness and\npower spectra could therefore help disentangle the thermal and the kinetic signals. We show that the data from\ncurrent small-scale CMB experiments have the potential\nto constrain the thermal SZ amplitude using bispectrum\nmeasurements with 5 \u2212 10% accuracy. Furthermore, a\ntightened constraint on the kinetic SZ amplitude can also\nimprove our understanding of the reionization scenario\n(Shaw et al. 2011; Zahn et al. 2011).\nSecond, as we will show, the signal is dominated by\nmassive clusters at intermediate redshift for which highprecision X-ray observations exist. This is in contrast\nto the power spectrum where the signal mainly comes\nfrom the lower mass and higher redshift groups and clusters (e.g., Trac et al. 2011). The theoretical uncertainty\nin the SZ skewness spectrum is thus expected to be significantly smaller than that of the SZ power spectrum.\nCombined measurements of the power spectrum and the\nbispectrum can thus be used to distinguish the contribution to the power spectrum from different cluster mass\n\nand redshift ranges.\nThe goal of this study is to derive the SZ skewness\nspectrum using an analytic model for the ICM gas and\nanalyze its astrophysics and cosmology dependence. In\nSection 2 we discuss the theory of the SZ bispectrum,\nand in Section 3 we describe our model for calculating\nthe thermal pressure of the intra-cluster medium used\nin the bispectrum calculation. In Section 4 we present\nour results, including the distribution of the skewness\nspectrum signal over mass and redshift, the theoretical\nuncertainty, cosmological dependence, and the prospects\nof detectability from the current data from SPT like\nsurveys. Section 5 presents summary and discussions.\nThroughout this work, we assume a fiducial cosmology\nwith zero curvature and parameters: \u03a9b = 0.045, \u03a9m =\n0.27, \u03c38 = 0.8, h = 0.71, ns = 0.97, (Komatsu et al.\n2011) and w0 = \u22121.\n2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK\n2.1. Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect\n\nThe Compton y-parameter for the thermal SZ effect is\n\u0013Z\n\u0012\nkB \u03c3T\n\u2206T\n=\nne (l)Te (l)dl,\n(1)\ny=\nTCMB\nme c2\n\nwhere l is the distance along the line-of-sight; ne and\nTe are the electron number density and temperature, respectively.\nThe thermal SZ power spectrum can be calculated by\nsumming up the square of Fourier transform of the projected SZ profile, weighted by the number density of clusters of a given mass and redshift,\nZ\nZ\ndn(M, z) 2\ndV\n\u1ef9 (M, z, l),\nd ln M\nCl = f (x\u03bd )2 dz\ndz\nd ln M\n(2)\nwhere V (z) is the comoving volume per steradian,\nf (x\u03bd ) = x\u03bd (coth(x\u03bd /2) \u2212 4) with x\u03bd = h\u03bd/(kB TCMB )\nat frequency \u03bd and is negative (positive) below (above)\n220 GHz, TCMB is the temperature of CMB at z = 0 and\nn(M, z) is the halo mass function of Tinker et al. (2008),\n\u1ef9(M, z, l) is the Fourier transform of the projected SZ\nprofile of a cluster, given by\n\u0012\n\u0013Z \u221e\n\u03c3T\nsin(lx/ls )\n4\u03c0rs\n,\ndx x2 Pe (M, z, x)\n\u1ef9(M, z, l) = 2\nls\nme c2\nlx/ls\n0\n(3)\nwhere x = r/rs , ls = DA (z)/rs , rs is the scale radius of\nthe 3D pressure profile, DA (z) is the angular diameter\ndistance at redshift z and Pe is the electron pressure profile. Note that we use the mass function fit for 400 times\nthe mean density, whereas the pressure profiles are defined at the virial overdensity (Bryan & Norman 1998).\nWe convert the mass function definition to the virial density in Eq. 2. The cosmology dependence of the SZ power\nspectrum comes from the angular diameter distance and\nthe growth function while the astrophysical dependence\ncomes from the pressure profiles.\n2.2. Bispectrum Theory\nThe CMB temperature fluctuations \u2206\u03b8(n\u0302) in a certain\ndirection, n\u0302, can be expanded into spherical harmonics\nas\nZ\n\u2206T \u2217\nalm = d2 n\u0302\nY (n\u0302) .\n(4)\nT lm\n\n\fSZ bispectrum\nThe angular bispectrum is\nBlm1 l12ml32 m3\n\n= hal1 m1 al2 m2 al3 m3 i ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the angle-averaged quantity in the full sky limit\ncan be written as\n\u0013\nX \u0012 l\nl2 l3\nm1 m2 m3\n1\nB(l1 l2 l3 ) =\n, (6)\nm 1 m 2 m 3 Bl 1 l 2 l 3\nm1 m2 m3\n\nwhich has to satisfy the conditions: m1 + m2 + m3 = 0,\nl1 + l2 + l3 = even, and |li \u2212 lj | \u2264 lk \u2264 li + lj . Here\nB(l1 l2 l3 ) is the bispectrum in the full-sky limit. In the\nsmall angle limit, the flat-sky approximation is valid. By\ndefining b(l1 l2 l3 ) to be the bispectrum in the flat-sky\nlimit, then the correspondence between the full-sky and\nthe flat-sky bispectrum is (Hu 2000),\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(2l1 + 1)(2l2 + 1)(2l3 + 1) l1 l2 l3\nB(l1 l2 l3 ) \u2248\n0 0 0 (7)\n4\u03c0\n\u00d7 b(l1 l2 l3 ).\nThroughout this work, we focus on the high-l regime\n(to avoid confusion from primary CMB and its lensing),\nwhere a flat sky approximation is valid. We will refer\nto the flat-sky bispectrum; namely, b(l1 l2 l3 ) as the bispectrum for brevity and B(l1 l2 l3 ) as the full-sky bispectrum. Note that, for l > 500, the Wigner 3-j symbol can\nbe approximated as\n\u0013 r\n\u0012\n(\u22121)L/2\n2\nl1 l2 l3\n\u2248\n0 0 0\n\u03c0 [L(L \u2212 2l1 )(L \u2212 2l2 )(L \u2212 2l3 )]1/4\n(8)\nif L = l1 + l2 + l3 is even, and vanishes for odd L. The\napproximate expression for Eq. 8 is valid to better than\n1 percent for l > 500, the l range we are interested in\nthis study.\nThe thermal SZ bispectrum is the volume integral of\nthe cube of the Fourier transform of the pressure profile\nweighted by the halo mass function,\nZ\nZ\ndV\ndn(M, z)\nb(l1 l2 l3 ) = f (x\u03bd )3 dz\nd ln M\ndz\nd ln M\n\u00d7 \u1ef9(M, z, l1 )\u1ef9(M, z, l2 )\u1ef9(M, z, l3 ).\n(9)\nWe sum over the two smaller values of ls and writing the\nbispectrum as a function of the largest l, we define the\nskewness spectrum as\nsX\n\u039b(l) =\nb2 (ll1 l2 ),\n(10)\nl1 l2\n\nwhere l + l1 + l2 is even and l1 \u2264 l2 \u2264 l.\nIn previous work, the amplitude of the thermal SZ\npower spectrum has been defined in terms of the expected amplitude at l = 3000 for a given set of cosmological parameters (Lueker et al. 2010; Shirokoff et al.\n2011; Reichardt et al. 2011; Dunkley et al. 2011).

In Section 4.3, we study the relation between the SZ amplitude of the power spectrum (AtSZ )\nand the skewness spectrum (BtSZ ) in more detail.\n3. MODELING THE INTRA-CLUSTER MEDIUM\n\nTo calculate the thermal pressure profiles of groups\nand clusters, we use the physically motivated analytic\nmodel presented in S10. Here we briefly describe the key\nfeatures of the model, and refer the readers to S10 for\nmore details.\nThe model assumes that intra-cluster gas resides in hydrostatic equilibrium within the gravitational potential\nof the host dark matter halo,\nd\u03a6(r)\ndPtot (r)\n= \u2212\u03c1g (r)\n,\n(13)\ndr\ndr\nwhere \u03c1g (r) is the gas density at radius r from the cluster center, the total pressure, Ptot (r) = Pth (r) + Pnt (r),\nis given by a sum of thermal and non-thermal pressures,\nand \u03c6(r) is the gravitational potential. The gas is assumed to have a polytropic equation of state, Ptot =\nP0 (\u03c1g /\u03c10 )\u0393 , where \u0393 = 1.2 and P0 and \u03c10 are the central\ngas pressure and density respectively. The total mass distribution is assumed to follow the Navarro-Frenk-White\n(NFW) profile (Navarro et al. 1996, 1997),\n\u03c1s\n\u03c1tot (r) =\n,\n(14)\nx(1 + x)2\nwhere \u03c1s is the normalization constant, x = r/rs , and\nrs is the characteristic radius and can be defined in\nterms of the concentration of halos, rs = rvir /cvir where\n\"vir\" refers to the virial overdensity (Bryan & Norman\n1998) with respect to the critical density of the universe. We adopt the concentration-mass relation given\nin Duffy et al. (2008):\n\u0013\u22120.081\n\u0012\nMvir\n(1+z)\u22120.71 ,\ncvir (M, z) = 7.85Ac\n2 \u00d7 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299\n(15)\n\n\f4\n\nBhattacharya et. al.\n\nFig. 1.- Comparison between the observed 'universal' pressure profile (scaled with respect to P500 ) of (Arnaud et al. 2010) (blue dashed\nHSE = 3 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M . In\nline, shaded region denotes 20% scatter) and our model predictions at z=0 for a cluster of hydrostatic mass M500\n\u2299\neach panel we vary one of the input model parameters to demonstrate their effect on the pressure profile. The black solid line represent\nthe fiducial values as given in Table 1. The top-left panel shows the profiles obtained when \u01ebf is 10\u22125 (red dotted line) and \u01ebDM varies\nfrom 0.2 to 0.0 (green dashed lines, from top to bottom at 2R500 ); in the top right panel we vary Ac from 0.8, 0.9, 1.1, 1.2 (red dotted\nlines, top to bottom at 2R500 ), the bottom-left panel shows the variation with \u03b10 from 0.3, 0.24, 0.14, 0.0 (red dotted lines, bottom to\ntop at 2R500 ) and the bottom-right panel shows the variation with \u03b2 at z = 0.5 over {1, 0.5, 0, \u22121} where self-similar evolution is factored\nout (red dotted lines, from bottom to top). Note that the observed result is at < R500 , the blue dotted line is an extension of the Arnaud\nprofile based on the simulation result.\n\nwhere Ac is the normalization factor, with the fiducial\nvalue Ac = 1. Note that the gas is distributed as a\nmassless tracer of dark matter distribution.\nThe model accounts for non-gravitational processes\nthat affect the thermal properties of the ICM including\nstar formation, energy feedback from supernovae (SNe)\nand Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), and non-thermal\npressure support due to bulk gas motions and turbulence.\nStar-formation is implemented by converting a certain\n(mass and redshift-dependent) fraction of the gas mass\ninto stars. We adopt the observed stellar mass fraction\nfor the local X-ray groups and clusters (Giodini et al.\n2009) and assume that the stellar populations evolve according to the \"fossil\" model of Nagamine et al. (2006).\n\nFollowing Ostriker et al. (2005), a fraction of the rest\nmass energy of the stars, \u01ebf M\u2217 c2 , is put back into the\ngas due to energy feedback from SNe and AGN, where\n\u01ebf is a free parameter. The model also accounts for\nthe transfer of energy from dark matter to gas by dynamical heating by infalling substructures, determined\nby the product of the total binding energy of the halo\n|EDM | and a free parameter \u01ebDM . Finally, we take into\naccount the non-thermal pressure support due to random gas motions as seen in hydrodynamical simulations\n(e.g., Kay et al. 2004; Rasia et al. 2004; Lau et al. 2009;\nBattaglia et al. 2010; Nelson et al. 2011). We assume the\nnon-thermal pressure to be a certain fraction of the total\n\n\fSZ bispectrum\n\nFig. 2.- Contribution to the SZ skewness spectrum of objects\nwithin a given mass range (top) and redshift range (bottom) range.\nWe show the ratio of the skewness spectrum in a mass/redshift\nrange to the total skewness spectrum.\n\npressure and a power law in radius,\n\u0013nnt\n\u0012\nPnt\nr\n,\n(z) = \u03b1(z)\nPtot\nR500\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03b1(z) = \u03b10 f (z), \u03b10 is the ratio of non-thermal to\ntotal pressure at R500 , the radius at which the spherical overdensity of the cluster is 500 times the critical\ndensity of the universe (enclosing mass M500 ). f (z) =\nmin[(1 + z)\u03b2 , (4\u2212nnt /\u03b10 \u2212 1) tanh(\u03b2z) + 1], nnt and \u03b2 are\nthe radial and redshift dependence of the non-thermal\npressure support, respectively. We set nnt = 0.8, motivated by comparisons to hydrodynamical simulations\n(S10, Battaglia et al. 2011), leaving \u03b2 as a free parameter.\nIn summary, our ICM model has five free parameters\nAC , \u01ebf , \u01ebDM , \u03b10 , and \u03b2. Since the key observable for the\nSZ effect is the pressure profile, we use measurements\nof the pressure profiles by Arnaud et al. (2010) based on\n31 massive (M500 > 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 ), low redshift (z . 0.2)\nclusters. Arnaud et al. (2010) showed that the pressure\n\n5\n\nFig. 3.- Top panel: the distribution of the skewness spectrum\nover mass and redshift at l = 3000.

Figure 1 shows the pressure profile fit to\nthe Arnaud et al. (2010) data along with our predictions\nHSE\nfor a typical cluster of mass M500\n= 3 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299\nHSE\nat z=0, where M500 is a cluster mass estimated assuming the hydrostatic equilibrium (see S10 for more discussions). Each of the 5 parameters are varied over a wide\nrange, including some extreme cases with a very high\nfeedback parameter or zero non-thermal pressure.\nThe parameter \u01ebf determines the amount of nongravitational ('feedback') energy injected into the ICM.\nHigh levels of feedback inflates the gas distribution, lowering the pressure in the inner region while boosting\nit in the cluster outskirts. For cluster-mass halos, the\nfeedback energy is a small fraction of the binding energy and has a minimal effect on the pressure profile.\nThe upper-left panel of Figure 1 shows how \u01ebf changes\nthe pressure profile in a cluster-mass halo at z = 0.\n\n\f6\n\nBhattacharya et. al.\n\nIncreasing \u01ebf by factor of \u223c 100 changes the pressure\nprofile by few percent at radii R < R500 and increases\nto about 30% at 3R500 . This is in qualitative agreement with the findings from hydrodynamical simulations\nincluding AGN feedback which indicate the impact of\nAGN feedback is more pronounced in groups than in\nclusters (Bhattacharya et al. 2008; Puchwein et al. 2008;\nSijacki et al. 2007; Teyssier et al. 2011; McCarthy et al.\n2010; Battaglia et al. 2010, 2011; Short et al. 2012). We\nnote however that our feedback model is highly simplistic and does not capture the full detail of AGN feedback\nas implemented in hydrodynamical simulations (for example, energy injection via jets).\n\u01ebDM determines the fraction of the total dark matter\nenergy transferred to the ICM during mergers. Clusters\nfrequently undergo mergers and hence \u01ebDM may have\na substantial effect on the ICM physics of clusters. As\nshown in Figure 1 (top-left), \u01ebDM changes the pressure\nprofile by 20-30% over the entire radius range as \u01ebDM\nvaries from 0 \u2212 0.2.\nThe normalization of the concentration-mass relation\n(Ac ) determines the characteristic radius of an NFW\ndark matter profile, approximately corresponding to the\nradius at which the slope changes from \u22121 to \u22123. The\nupper-right panel of Figure 1 shows the change in the\nthermal pressure profile as Ac varies from 0.8 \u2212 1.2. Increasing the concentration deepens the central potential\nwhich draws the gas towards the cluster core, steepening\nthe pressure profile. The impact of increasing halo concentration provides a similar (although opposite) effect\nto that of energy feedback.\nThe nonthermal pressure parameter, \u03b10 , determines\nthe fraction of the total gas pressure contributed by random gas motions. As \u03b10 is varied is the thermal pressure fraction adjusts accordingly such that the total gas\npressure is fixed. As shown in Figure 1 (bottom-left),\nthe thermal pressure profile changes by about 60% at\nR500 as \u03b10 varies from 0 \u2212 0.3. \u03b2 determines the redshift\nevolution of the non-thermal pressure fraction. S10 obtained an estimate for \u03b2 by comparing the redshift 0 and\n1 outputs of the simulations of Lau et al. (2009), finding\nthat the best fit value for \u03b10 increases from 0.18 \u2212 0.26\nimplying \u03b2 = 0.5. The bottom-right panel in Figure 1\nshows the pressure profile of a cluster at z=0.5 and how \u03b2\nchanges the thermal pressure profile. A positive value of\n\u03b2 increases the amount of non-thermal pressure at higher\nredshift and hence decreases the thermal pressure as redshift increases. The pressure profile decreases by about\n20% as \u03b2 varies from \u22121 to 1.\nOverall, we find that the range \u01ebf < 10\u22126 , \u01ebDM =\n0.04 \u2212 0.06, Ac = 0.8 \u2212 1.1, and \u03b10 = 0.14 \u2212 0.24\nto be in agreement with the Arnaud pressure profile\nwithin the uncertainty (see Figure 1). Note that, as\ndescribed in S10, the constraints on \u01ebf < 10\u22126 and\n\u01ebDM = 0.04 \u2212 0.06 mainly come from the gas fractionmass relation of Vikhlinin et al. (2006). We also find\nthe entropy scaling relation (e.g., entropy - X-ray temperature relation) predicted by our ICM model to be in\nagreement with the data of Pratt et al. (2010) within the\nranges of the ICM parameters. This illustrates that the\ncurrent observations can indeed constrain the ICM parameter space significantly.\n4.

Mass and redshift contributions\n\nFigure 2 shows the fraction of skewness spectrum signal contributed by different ranges of halo mass and redshift. At l \u223c 3000, galaxy groups (M500 < 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 )\nsource only 5% of the signal, while lower mass clusters contribute about 20%. The majority of the signal comes from the massive clusters. The distribution\nof the skewness spectrum is tabulated in Table 2 over\ndifferent mass and redshift ranges. We also calculate\nthe signal expected from clusters that are below the detection threshold of the current generation of SZ surveys. Following Benson et al. (2011); Vanderlinde et al.\n(2010), we choose the SPT mass threshold of M500 \u223c\n2.5 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 , roughly corresponding to the detection significance of 5\u03c3. The skewness spectrum gets only\n20% (at l = 1500) to 40% (at l = 6000) of the signal from\nclusters with M500 . 2.5 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 . In contrast, the\nSZ power spectrum gets about two-thirds of the signal\nfrom groups and clusters with M500 . 2.5 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 .\nFigure 3, top panel shows the cumulative fractional\ndistribution of the skewness spectrum for halos with mass\n< M500 and redshift > z, from 10-90% of the signal (topleft to bottom-right) at l = 3000. In terms of the redshift\ndistribution, about 90% of the skewness spectrum signal\ncomes from z< 1. The bottom panel of Figure 3 shows\nthe distribution of the SZ power spectrum, showing that\na significant fraction of the thermal SZ power comes from\nhigh-z, low-mass objects (i.e., about 40% of the power\ncoming from z > 0.7 and M500 < 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 ) where the\nICM properties are still very uncertain. In comparison,\nthe SZ skewness spectrum signal is dominated by low-z,\nmassive clusters.\n4.2. Astrophysical Uncertainties\n\nWe now evaluate how robust the predicted skewness\nspectrum is to uncertainties in the underlying ICM model\nparameters. Figure 4 shows the variation of the SZ skewness spectrum over the range of ICM parameters given\nin Table 1 and plotted in Figure 1. As discussed in Section 3, \u01ebf does not have a significant effect on the massive\nclusters that dominate the skewness spectrum. Consequently, as shown in the top-left panel of Figure 1, the\nskewness spectrum varies only by 14% as \u01ebf varies from\n(1-100) \u00d710\u22127 . On the other hand, the pressure profiles\nof massive clusters vary substantially with \u01ebDM , and the\nskewness spectrum varies by about 40% as \u01ebDM is varied\nfrom 0 to 0.2. In contrast, the power spectrum receives\na significant contribution from a wider range in mass,\nM500 = 1013 \u2212 1015 h\u22121 M\u2299 , especially at high l. As a result, \u01ebf shows more variations at l = 8000 (group scales)\nthan at l = 2000 (cluster scales, see Fig. 7 of S10).\n\n\fSZ bispectrum\n\n7\n\nFig. 4.- Dependence of the SZ skewness spectrum on the cluster gas physics. The solid line indicates the fiducial model with \u01ebf =\n4 \u00d7 10\u22127 , \u01ebDM = 0.05, Ac = 1.0, \u03b10 = 0.2, and \u03b2 = 0.5. The dotted and dashed lines represent the skewness spectrum predicted by our\nICM model for a range of ICM parameter values. The top-left panel shows the impact of \u01ebf (red dotted line: 10\u22125 and black solid line:\n4 \u00d7 10\u22127 ) and \u01ebDM (green dashed lines: 0.0, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.2 from top to bottom); the top-right panel shows the change with Ac\n(0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 from bottom to top); the bottom-left panel shows the variations with \u03b10 (0.0, 0.14, 0.2, 0.24, 0.3 from top to bottom);\nand the bottom-right panel shows the variation with \u03b2 (\u22121, 0, 0.5, 1 from top to bottom).\n\nIncreasing the normalization of the concentration-mass\nrelation (Ac ) deepens the potential well of the clusters\nwhich steepens the pressure profiles. The top-right panel\nof Figure 4 shows the change in the skewness spectrum\nis about \u00b1 30% for a \u00b1 20% change in Ac (compared to\nthe power spectrum where the variation is \u223c 20%). This\ncan be understood from the fact that the skewness amplitude is \u221d(power spectrum)1.5 , so a 20% change in power\nspectrum corresponds to a 30% change in the skewness\nspectrum. Also note that in contrast to the case of \u01ebf ,\nthe effect of Ac is not significantly mass-dependent.\nThe lower-left panel shows the effect on the skewness\nspectrum of varying the non-thermal pressure parameter\n\u03b10 . The skewness spectrum changes by about 70% across\nthe range \u03b10 = 0\u22120.3. As the SZ skewness spectrum gets\nmost of its signal from massive clusters at z . 0.4, the\n\nuncertainty in the z-evolution of the non-thermal pressure (\u03b2) contributes only about 20% uncertainty to the\nSZ skewness spectrum. The SZ power spectrum, on the\nother hand gets its signal from high-z objects and as a\nresult \u03b2 adds \u223c 30 \u2212 40% uncertainty in the SZ power\nspectrum (bottom-right panel of Figure 7 in S10).\nFigure 5 shows the astrophysical uncertainties in the\nshaded area around the fiducial model. Here, the total\nuncertainty is computed by adding the uncertainties (calibrated by the observed pressure profile and discussed in\ndetail in Section 3) in each ICM parameter in quadrature. On average, about 75 \u2212 80% of the skewness spectrum signal arises from massive lower redshift objects;\ni.e., M500 & 5 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 at hzi0.4, and hence is less\nsensitive to the variation in ICM parameters than the\npower spectrum (c.f. Figure 7 in S10). Figure 5 shows\n\n\f8\n\nBhattacharya et. al.\n\nFig. 5.- Astrophysical uncertainties in the SZ skewness spectrum. The solid line represents the fiducial model and the shaded\nregion indicates astrophysical uncertainty for the ICM parameter\nrange calibrated by the observed pressure profile (see Section 3).\nAt l = 3000, the astrophysical uncertainties are \u223c 33%.\n\nthe gas physics uncertainty in the skewness spectrum to\nbe about 33%. We also provide the theoretical prediction of the skewness spectrum for the fiducial values of\ncosmological and ICM parameters.\nAt this point, it is worth commenting on effects of several simplifying assumptions in our model. First, we assumed a constant \u0393 = 1.2. However, recent work suggests that \u0393 could be radially dependent, especially at\nlarge radii (r < Rvir ). However, the bulk (\u224895%) of the\nskewness signal arises from r < Rvir , and \u0393 \u2248 1.14 \u2212 1.3\nover the redshift range z = 0 \u2212 1 (Battaglia et al. 2011).\nWe therefore find that the skewness spectrum changes\nby about \u00b110 \u2212 15% in the specified range of \u0393. Also,\nthere is uncertainty in the number of baryons converted\ninto stars in clusters, since this is only constrained by\nredshift zero observations. Secondly, the redshift dependence of the model assumes that evolution of the stellar\nfraction is the same for all galaxies, although it is possible that the star fraction evolve differently in a cluster\nenvironment. In order to assess the impact of star formation model on the skewness spectrum, we considered\na no evolution model and found that the difference between the \"no-evolution\" model and the fiducial model\n(namely the \"fossil\" model of Nagamine et al. (2006)) is\nnegligible. Finally, recent work on the thermal SZ power\nspectrum have shown that variations about a mean profile may produce up to a 15% excess in the spectrum at\nl \u223c 3000 (e.g., Battaglia et al. 2011). This variation is\nnon-Gaussian and radially-dependent and can lead to the\nenhancement of the bispectrum amplitude.\n4.3. The relation between the power spectrum and the\n\nskewness spectrum amplitude\nGiven a measurement of the SZ skewness spectrum amplitude, we can predict the expected amplitude of the\nthermal SZ power spectrum, namely the BtSZ \u2212 AtSZ\n\nFig. 6.- Scaling of BtSZ \u2212 AtSZ for the skewness spectrum when\n\u03c38 varies from 0.7 to 0.9. The relations are relatively robust to the\nchanges in gas physics and vary by only \u223c 7% (shaded area) for the\nallowed ICM parameter range calibrated by the observed pressure\nprofile (see Section 3). The dashed lines indicate the uncertainty\nrange bracketed by the two extreme gas physics scenarios.\nl\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\n\nl2 /(2\u03c0)\u039b(l)\u03bcK3\n0.66\n0.69\n0.56\n0.44\n0.35\n0.28\n\nTABLE 3\nThe theoretical prediction of the skewness spectrum for\nthe fiducial values of ICM and cosmology parameters.\n\nrelation. Recall that the power spectrum and the skewness spectrum are proportional to the square and the\ncube of the pressure profile, respectively. If we assume\nthe skewness spectrum and the power spectrum have the\nsame mass and redshift distribution, then any changes\nin gas physics affects the skewness spectrum and (power\nspectrum)1.5 in the same way. However, as shown in\nSec 4.1, the skewness spectrum depends mostly on the\nmassive clusters at intermediate redshift, while the power\nspectrum receives a substantial contribution from higher\nredshift galaxy groups. Furthermore, the cluster physics\naffect the gas properties in lower mass structures more\nthan in clusters. Therefore, the BtSZ \u2212 AtSZ relation is\nexpected to deviate from the above relation and depends\non both cosmology and cluster astrophysics.\nTo investigate the dependence of the BtSZ \u2212 AtSZ relation on cluster physics and cosmology, we vary \u03c38 from\n0.7 \u2212 0.9 in steps of 0.05 and compute the BtSZ \u2212 AtSZ\nrelation for each value of \u03c38 for our fiducial gas physics\nmodel. Figure 6 shows that the skewness spectrum amplitude is proportional to the power spectrum amplitude,\n1.4\nBtSZ (l = 3000) = AtSZ\n(l = 3000).\n\n(17)\n\nThis is shallower than the expected A1.5\ntSZ behavior, primarily because the skewness spectrum signal comes from\n\n\fSZ bispectrum\n\n9\n\nwhere the pressure profile amplitude is maximally suppressed by high feedback and non-thermal pressure and\nlow concentration: \u01ebf = 10\u22125 , \u01ebDM = 0.1, \u03b10 = 0.3,\nand Ac = 0.8. The second case other case consists of\nthe parameter choice that predicts a higher amplitude:\n\u01ebf = \u01ebDM = \u03b10 = 0.0 and Ac = 1.2. We find that even\nfor the two extreme gas physics scenarios the ASZ \u2212 BtSZ\nhas an overall uncertainty of only by \u223c 15% (indicated by\ndashed lines in Fig 6). The slope of the relation changes\nfrom 1.33 to 1.47 between these two cases. This is encouraging as using the skewness spectrum data we can\nmeasure BtSZ , then use this theoretical relation to derive\nAtSZ .\nThe relation in Eq. 17 implies the skewness spectrum\namplitude varies as \u03c3811\u221212 . We also investigate how the\nskewness spectrum varies with other cosmological parameters. Figure 7 shows the variation of the skewness\nspectrum with \u03c38 and \u03a9b . Each panel shows how each\ncosmological parameter changes the skewness spectrum\nwhile other parameters are fixed at their respective fiducial values. The figure shows that the skewness spectrum\ndepends very sensitively on \u03c38 , and the amplitude varies\n\u039b\nas BSZ\n\u221d \u03c3811.6 , as expected. The variations with \u03a9b is\nmoderate, while \u03a9m , h, w0 , and ns show much smaller\nvariation. We find the SZ amplitude for the skewness\nspectrum follows the scaling (at l = 3000),\n\u0010 \u03c3 \u001111.6 \u0012 \u03a9 \u00134.1 \u0012 h \u00132.5 \u0012 w \u0013\u22120.95\nb\n0\n8\n(18)\nBtSZ \u221d\n0.8\n0.045\n0.71\n\u22121.0\n\u0010 n \u0011\u22121.5 \u0012 \u03a9 \u0013\u22120.46\nm\ns\n.\n\u00d7\n0.97\n0.27\n\nFig. 7.- Dependence of the skewness spectrum on \u03c38 and \u03a9b .\nThe fiducial values are \u03a9b = 0.045 and \u03c38 =0.8. The range of\nparameters are indicated in the top-right corner of each panel. The\nparameter values increase from bottom to top.\n\nmore massive clusters which are not point-like at the angular scales equivalent to l \u223c 3000. We thus study the radial dependence of the skewness spectrum signal and find\nthat less than 5% signal comes from [1-2]Rvir , 20% comes\nfrom [0.5-1]Rvir, 60% from [0.2-0.5]Rvir, the rest 15%\nfrom \u2264 0.2Rvir . Thus a simple scaling of the pressure\nnormalization with mass cannot explain the BtSZ \u2212 AtSZ\nrelation. Next we investigate the variation of the scaling relation with the ICM parameters. Within the range\nof the ICM parameters allowed by the observed pressure\nprofile, we find the BtSZ \u2212 AtSZ relation is robust and\nthe overall uncertainty does not vary by more than 7%\n(indicated by shaded area in Figure 6). The tight scaling\narises because both the power spectrum and the skewness\nspectrum depend on the pressure profile. As a result, the\namplitudes of the two spectra varies in similar ways as\nwe vary our model parameters.\nTo check the robustness of the relation further, we consider two extreme gas physics scenarios, such that the\nSZ power spectrum varies from 2.5 \u2212 10\u03bcK2 (roughly\nby factor of \u223c 4) which is roughly twice the theoretical uncertainty assumed in the current SZ power spectrum analysis (Reichardt et al. 2011). The first case is\n\nNote that not all cosmological parameters follow a simple\nBtSZ = A1.4\ntSZ relation. The difference in scaling is due to\nthe different range of masses in the mass function contributing to the skewness spectrum and the power spectrum. Note that we ignore the cosmology dependence\nof the concentration-mass relation (Bhattacharya et al.\n2011a) in our study which can lead to a slightly different\nscaling of the skewness spectrum amplitude with cosmology. We provide the theoretical prediction of the skewness spectrum in Table 3 for our fiducial cosmology and\ngas parameters.\n5. DETECTABILITY\n\nWe now assess the detectability of the SZ skewness spectrum in the presence of other secondary CMB\nanisotropy signals and extra-galactic foregrounds. Other\nthan the thermal SZ effect, point sources (dusty, starforming galaxies (DSFGs), and radio sources) will also\ncontribute to the skewness spectrum signal. The main\ndifference is while the thermal SZ effect contribute a negative bispectrum, the point sources contribute a positive\nsignal (Rubi\u00f1o-Mart\u0131\u0301n & Sunyaev 2003). Assuming that\nthe clustered component of the DSFGs follows the Gaussian distribution, the skewness spectrum of the correlated DSFG is zero. As mentioned before, the kinetic SZ\nfollow approximately Gaussian distribution and is thus\nassumed to have negligible skewness. We also ignore a\npossible skewness spectrum signal arising from the correlation between the SZ effect and the DSFG sources.\n5.1. Noise Estimates\n\n\f10\n\nBhattacharya et. al.\n\nFig. 8.- Detectability of the SZ skewness spectrum at 150 GHz. The left panel shows the SZ (black solid) and the point sourcesDSFG+radio skewness spectrum (red dotted line). Also shown are the total skewness spectrum: SZ+DSFG+radio (green thin dot-dashed)\nand the DSFG+radio skewness spectrum if no point sources are removed from the map (blue short dashed line). The right panel shows the\nsignal-to-noise integrated to a certain l of the SZ skewness spectrum (black solid), the total- SZ+DSFG+radio (red dotted). We assume\nan SPT-like survey with sky coverage of 2500 deg2 , 18 \u03bcK-arcmin, 1.2 arcmin at 150 GHz.\n\nThe noise of the total skewness spectrum, assuming the\nprimary contribution to the variance of the bispectrum\ncomes from the power spectrum of the CMB sky, is given\nby Komatsu & Spergel (2001)\nN 2 (l1 l2 l3 ) = C(l1 )C(l2 )C(l3 )\u2206l1 l2 l3 ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere C(l) is the total power spectrum that includes contributions from (1) the SZ power spectrum computed using Eq. 2, (2) the lensed CMB power spectrum computed\nusing CAMB for the fiducial cosmology (Lewis et al.\n2000), (3) the noise due to the finite resolution of an\nexperiment, and (4) point sources, including dusty starforming galaxies (DSFG) and radio sources. Note that\n\u2206l1 l2 l3 = 6 if all three ls are equal, \u2206l1 l2 l3 =2 if two\nof the three ls are equal and \u2206l1 l2 l3 =1 if all three ls\nare different. We describe the estimate of (3) and (4) in\nmore detail below.\nThe noise due to the finite resolution of the experiment\nis given by Knox (1995); Jungman et al. (1996)\n\u0014 2 2 \u0015\nl \u03b8\n\u22121\n,\n(20)\nNb (l) = w exp\n8 log 2\nwhere w\u22121 = [\u03c3pix \u03b8/TCMB ]2 is the weight per unit solid\nangle, \u03c3pix is the noise per pixel, \u03b8 is the FWHM of\nthe instrument in radians, TCMB is the CMB temperature. Eq. 19 gives the expression for noise in the full sky\nlimit. For the fractional coverage, Eq. 19 is multiplied\n\u22123/2\nby fsky , where fsky is the fraction of the sky covered\nby the assumed surveys. Here we consider an SPT like\nsurvey with fsky given by 2500 deg2 sky coverage, \u03c3pix\nis 18 \u03bcK-arcmin at 150 GHz with the pixel size set by\na Gaussian beam of FWHM=1.2 arcmin. The powers of\nthe unresolved DSFG sources at 150 GHz are given by\n5.25\u00d710\u22126\u03bcK2 (Poisson) and 4.4\u00d710\u22126(l/3000)\u22121.2\u03bcK2\n(clustered), and that of the radio sources is 9 \u00d7 10\u22127\u03bcK2\n\n(Poisson) at 150 GHz (Reichardt et al. 2011).\n5.2. Point Source Bispectrum\n\nThe DSFG population comprises of a clustered component and a Poisson component, both of which contribute\nto the point source power spectrum. We assume that\nthe clustered component produces Gaussian fluctuations\nand hence does not contribute to the bispectrum of the\npoint sources. We thus consider the bispectrum contribution only from the Poisson component of the DSFGs\nand the radio galaxies. The Poisson component of the\nDSFG typically comprises of two populations: (1) the\nbright point sources which are detected by the CMB experiments (Vieira et al. 2010; Marriage et al. 2011) and\n(2) the faint sources which follow a shallower distribution compared to the bright sources, and are undetected\nby the current CMB experiments but contribute a significant portion of the arcminute scale DSFG power measured in the CMB experiments. Both populations are\nexpected to contribute to the total point source bispectrum.\nGiven the DSFG flux number counts dN/dS, we can\nwrite the bispectrum of DSFGs as\nSmin\n\ndN\nNDSFG (> Smin ) 3\n=\nS ,\ndS\n3/\u03b2DSFG \u2212 1 min\n0\n(21)\nwhere the flux number counts is assumed to vary\nas dN/dS \u221d S \u2212\u03b2\u22121 , Smin is the flux cut above\nwhich all sources are detected and removed from the\nCMB maps, NDSFG (> Smin ) is the number density\n(per unit solid angle) of the DSFG with S > Smin ,\ng(x\u03bd ) = 1/(65.55 MJy sr\u22121 )[sinh(x\u03bd /2)/x2\u03bd ]2 , and x\u03bd =\n\u03bd/(56.8GHz). Similarly, we define the bispectrum of the\nradio sources in terms of the radio source power spectrum\nbDSFG\n=\ng 3 (x\u03bd )\n\nZ\n\ndS S 3\n\n\fSZ bispectrum\nas\nbrad\n=\ng 3 (x\u03bd )\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nSmin\n\ndS S 3\n\ndN\nNrad (> Smin ) 3\n=\nS . (22)\ndS\n3/\u03b2rad \u2212 1 min\n\nWe assume all point sources above 5\u03c3 at 150 GHz are\ndetected and removed (masked). For the SPT 150 GHz\nband, this corresponds to Smin =6.4 mJy (Vieira et al.\n2010). We adopt the number density of the DSFG to be\nNDSFG = 0.3 deg\u22122 (Negrello et al. 2007) and \u03b2DSFG =\n1.93 for the total (bright +faint) DSFG population to\nbe consistent with the total DSFG power spectrum measured in the CMB surveys (e.g., Reichardt et al. 2011).\nFor the radio population we adopt Nrad (> Smin ) =\n1.29 deg\u22122 and \u03b2rad = 1.03, which is consistent with\nthe 150 GHz source counts in Vieira et al. (2010). The\nskewness spectra of the radio sources and DSFGs are calculated the same way as the SZ skewness spectrum by\nplugging Eqs. 21 and 22 in Eq. 10.\nThe skewness spectrum for the various components at\n150 GHz are shown in the left panel of Figure 8. Provided\nthe point sources that are detected above 5\u03c3 in the SPT\nband-power are removed, the DSFG and radio population make negligible contribution to the skewness spectrum at l . 4000. Beyond this scale the skewness spectra of point sources and SZ effect become comparable.\nIf no point sources are removed, then the skewness spectrum of the point sources (DSFG+radio) is a factor of 4-5\nhigher compared to the case with point source removal\nand becomes the dominant signal at l > 5000. Since\nthe point sources and the SZ bispectrum have opposite\nsigns, the total skewness spectrum (SZ+point sources) is\nsmaller than the SZ skewness spectrum alone, especially\nat higher-l where the point source bispectrum becomes\nnon-negligible.\n5.3. Signal-to-Noise\n\nFinally, using Eq. 7, we define the signal-to-noise (S/N)\nin terms of the full-sky bispectrum. The S/N integrated\nto a certain l (Komatsu & Spergel 2001; Hu 2000), \u03bb(<\nl) or \u03bbl can be written as\nv\nuX\nu\nB 2 (l1 l2 l3 )\n,\n(23)\n\u03bb(< l) = t\nN 2 (l1 l2 l3 )\nl1 l2 l3\n\nwhere l3 \u2264 l2 \u2264 l1 \u2264 l. The right panel of Figure 8\nshows the total S/N for the SZ skewness spectrum. For\na 2500 deg2 SPT like survey at 150 GHz, the integrated\nS/N for the SZ skewness spectrum is \u2248 16. Note that\nthe total (SZ+point source) skewness spectrum is lower\nthan the SZ skewness spectrum alone, because these two\nspectra have opposite sign. We find the S/N of the total\nskewness spectrum is only 10% smaller than the SZ only\ncase.\n6. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nWe investigated the SZ bispectrum and the prospects\nof its detection with the current and upcoming CMB\nsurveys. We define a skewness spectrum of the SZ effect\nwhich is a sum over all possible triangle configurations\nover the two smaller sides and expressed as a function of\nthe largest side. About half of the SZ skewness spectrum\nsignal arises from massive (M500 & 6.5 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 )\n\n11\n\nclusters in the local universe (z . 0.4). This is in contrast to the SZ power spectrum whose signals come primarily from high-z, low-mass galaxy groups (M500 <\n2 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 and z & 0.6) that have little observational constraints at present. The skewness spectrum,\ntherefore, is less susceptible to the large astrophysical\nuncertainties associated with high-z, low-mass groups.\nOur model for the SZ profile from groups and clusters reproduces the pressure profile of massive X-ray\nclusters in the local universe. This provides significant\nconstraints on the ICM models of the present-day massive clusters leaving only the redshift dependent parameters unknown. Adopting wide priors on these parameters, we determine astrophysical uncertainties in the\nskewness spectrum to be about 33%. This is in contrast to the SZ power spectrum which is uncertain at\nthe level of 50%, primarily because a significant fraction of the power comes from high-z, low-mass groups\nwith M500 . 2 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 and z & 0.6. Such objects have not been studied in as much detail as their\nhigh mass counterparts, making their theoretical modeling and hence the SZ power spectrum highly uncertain.\nOther than the gas physics uncertainties, the theoretical\nmodeling of the cluster mass function also add to the uncertainties in the bispectrum prediction. Because of the\nexponential nature of the mass function at the massive\ncluster end, a small change in cluster masses cause significant difference in the abundance of massive clusters\n(Bhattacharya et al. 2011).\nThe relation of the amplitude of the SZ skewness spectrum and the SZ power spectrum is robust to these astrophysical uncertainties. Indeed, the overall uncertainty\nof the relation is only 7% within the allowed range of\nICM parameters. The skewness and the power spectrum amplitudes of the thermal SZ effect is related as\n\u039b\nBSZ\n= A1.4\ntSZ ; consequently, the skewness spectrum varies\n\u039b\nas BSZ\n\u221d \u03c3811.6 . Given the astrophysical uncertainty of\n33%, the skewness spectrum measurements have the potential to constrain \u03c38 to better than 3% accuracy. Since\nthe SZ skewness spectrum gets its contribution primarily\nfrom the thermal component, the SZ skewness spectrum\nmeasurements can constrain the thermal SZ component\nuniquely. We can then use the skewness spectrum measurements to break the degeneracy between thermal and\nthe kinetic power spectrum measurements.\nWe show that the current high resolution experiments,\nsuch as ACT, Planck, and SPT, have the potential to\nmeasure the skewness spectrum. For example, using the\nfull 2500 deg2 of data, SPT should be able to detect the\nSZ skewness spectrum with a signal-to-noise \u2248 16. Indeed, the SZ skewness signal we predict in this study is\ndetected by the ACT collaboration at 5\u03c3 (Wilson et al.\n2012). We note however that our noise calculation does\nnot account for all possible sources, as we make several\nsimplified assumptions. For example, the contribution of\nthe trispectrum is assumed to be negligible and we ignore\nany spatial correlation between the tSZ and CIB. However, as most of the SZ trispectrum signal comes from\nmassive clusters (Shaw et al. 2009), masking out these\nobjects should help reduce the SZ trispectrum contribution to the non-Gaussian component of the variance of\nthe skewness spectrum. Also we assume the lensing 3pt function and its correlation with the SZ 3-pt function\n\n\f12\n\nBhattacharya et. al.\n\nis zero, because CMB lensing dominates at l \u2264 2000\nwhile the SZ skewness spectrum gets most of the signal\nat l \u223c 4000 (see Fig 8, right panel). In this study we also\nassume the kSZ bispectrum is negligible. While this assumption is valid for the linear part of the kSZ effect, the\nnon-linear kSZ effect contributes a non-zero bispectrum\nwhich is not included in our calculation. However, given\nthat the overall magnitude of the kSZ effect is about 2040% of the thermal SZ amplitude, the non-linear kSZ\nbispectrum should be small. Nevertheless, in order to\nuse the SZ skewness spectrum as a robust cosmological\nprobe, these assumptions must be tested using mock catalogs. We will present such study in our future work.\nWe acknowledge useful discussions with John Carl-\n\nstrom, Salman Habib, and Katrin Heitmann.
