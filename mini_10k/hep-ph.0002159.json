The structure of our neutrino mass matrix is found to be stable\nagainst radiative corrections.\n\nThe solar neutrino data as well as the atmospheric one give big impact on the study of\nthe lepton mass matrices. There is a typical texture of the lepton mass matrix with the\nnearly maximal mixing of flavors, which is derived from the symmetry of the lepton flavor\ndemocracy [1, 2], or from the S3L \u00d7S3R symmetry of the left-handed Majorana neutrino mass\nmatrix [3, 4]. This texture have given a prediction for the neutrino mixing sin2 2\u03b8atm = 8/9.\nThe mixing for the solar neutrino depends on the symmetry breaking pattern of the flavor\nsuch as sin2 2\u03b8\u2299 = 1 or \u226a 1. However, the LMA-MSW solution, sin2 2\u03b8\u2299 = 0.65 \u223c 0.97 and\n\u2206m2\u2299 = 10\u22125 \u223c 10\u22124 eV2 [5], has not been obtained in the previous works [1, 2, 3, 4]. We\nstudy how to get the LMA-MSW solution in the S3L \u00d7 S3R symmetric mass matrices, and\ndiscuss the stability of the neutrino mass matrix against radiative corrections.\nThe texture of the charged lepton mass matrix was presented based on the S3L \u00d7 S3R\nsymmetry as follows [1, 3, 6]:\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1 1 1\ncl \uf8ec\n(c)\nMl = \uf8ed 1 1 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8 + Ml ,\n3\n1 1 1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the second matrix is the flavor symmetry breaking one. The unitary matrix Vl , which\ndiagonalizes the mass matrix Ml , is given as Vl = F L, where\n\u221a\n\u221a \uf8f6\n\u221a\n\uf8eb\n1/ \u221a2\n1/\u221a6 1/\u221a3\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nF = \uf8ed \u22121/ 2 1/ \u221a6 1/\u221a3 \uf8f8\n(2)\n0\n\u22122/ 6 1/ 3\n(c)\n\ndiagonalizes the democratic matrix and L depends on the mass correction term Ml .\n\n1\n\n\fThe neutrino mass matrix is different from the democratic one if they are Majorana\nparticles. The S3L symmetric mass term is given as follows:\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1 1 1\n1 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nc\u03bd \uf8ed 0 1 0 \uf8f8 + c\u03bd r \uf8ed 1 1 1 \uf8f8 ,\n1 1 1\n0 0 1\n\n(3)\n\nwhere c\u03bd and r are arbitrary parameters. The eigenvalues of this matrix are easily obtained\nby using the orthogonal matrix F in eq.(2) as c\u03bd (1, 1, 1 + 3r).\nThe simplest breaking terms of the S3L symmetry are added in (3,3) and (2,2) entries.\nTherefore, the neutrino mass matrix is written as\n\uf8eb\n\n1+r\n\uf8ec\nM\u03bd = c\u03bd \uf8ed r\nr\n\n\uf8f6\n\nr\nr\n\uf8f7\n1+r+\u01eb\nr\n\uf8f8 ,\nr\n1+r+\u03b4\n\n(4)\n\nin terms of small breaking parameters \u01eb and \u03b4. In order to explain both solar and atmospheric\nneutrinos in this mass matrix, r \u226a 1 should be satisfied. However, there is no reason why r\nis very small in this framework. In order to answer this question, we need a higher symmetry\nof flavors such as the O3L \u00d7 O3R model [7].\nLet us consider the case of \u03b4 \u226b \u01eb \u2243 r, in which S3L symmetry is completely broken.\nThen neutrino mass eigenvalues are given as\n1\n1\u221a 2\nm1 \u2243 1 + \u01eb + r \u2212\n\u01eb + 4r 2 ,\n2\n2\n\n1\u221a 2\n1\nm2 \u2243 1 + \u01eb + r +\n\u01eb + 4r 2 ,\n2\n2\n\nin the c\u03bd unit. The orthogonal matrix U\u03bd is given as\n\u221a\n\uf8eb\nr \uf8f6\n1 \u2212 t2\nt\n\u03b4\n\u221a\nr \uf8f7\nt\nU\u03bd \u2243 \uf8ec\n\uf8ed \u2212 1 \u2212 t2\n\u03b4\u2212\u01eb \uf8f8 ,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nr\nr\n( 1 \u2212 t2 \u2212 t) \u2212 \u03b4\u2212\u01eb\n(t + 1 \u2212 t2 ) 1\n\u03b4\n\nt2 =\n\nm3 \u2243 1 + r + \u03b4, (5)\n\n\u01eb\n1 1\n+ \u221a2\n.\n2 2 \u01eb + 4r 2\n\n(6)\n\nSince the correction term L is close to the unit matrix, the MNS matrix U\u03b1i is approximately given as F T U\u03bd as follows:\n\u221a1 (t +\n2 \u221a\n\n\u221a\n\n1 \u2212 t2 )\n\uf8ec 1\n2r\n2\n\u221a\nF T U\u03bd \u2243 \uf8ec\n\uf8ed 6 (t \u2212 \u221a1 \u2212 t )(1 + \u03b4 )\n\u221a1 (t \u2212\n1 \u2212 t2 )(1 \u2212 r\u03b4 )\n3\n\uf8eb\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a1 (\n2\u221a\n\n\u01ebr\n1 \u2212 t2 \u2212 t)\n\u2212 \u221a12 \u03b4(\u03b4\u2212\u01eb)\n\uf8f7\n2r\n\u221a1 (t +\n1 \u2212 t2 )(1 + \u03b4\u2212\u01eb\n) \u2212 \u221a26 (1 \u2212 \u03b4r ) \uf8f7\n\uf8f8 .\n6\n\u221a\n1\n1\nr\n2r\n2\n\u221a (t +\n1 \u2212 t )(1 \u2212 \u03b4\u2212\u01eb ) \u221a3 (1 + \u03b4 )\n3\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(7)\n\nThe mixing angle between the first and second flavor depends on t, which is determined by\nr/\u01eb. It becomes\n\u221a the maximal angle in the case of t = 1 (r/\u01eb = 0) and the minimal one in the\ncase of t = 1/ 2 (\u01eb/r = 0). Since we get sin2 2\u03b8\u2299 = \u01eb2 /(\u01eb2 + 4r 2), the relevant value of r/\u01eb\nleads easily to sin2 2\u03b8\u2299 = 0.65 \u223c 0.97, which corresponds to the LMA-MSW solution. The\nnumerical results have been shown in ref. [8].\nWe should carefully discuss the stability of our results against radiative corrections since\nthe model predicts nearly degenerate neutrinos. When the texture of the mass matrix is\ngiven at the S3L \u00d7 S3R symmetry energy scale, radiative corrections are not negligible at the\nelectoroweak (EW) scale.\n2\n\n\fLet us consider the basis, in which the mass matrix of the charged leptons is diagonal.\nThe neutrino mass matrix in eq.(4) is transformed into Vl\u2020 M\u03bd Vl . The radiatively corrected\nmass matrix in the MSSM at the EW scale is given as RG M \u03bd RG , where RG is given by\nRGE's [9] as\n\uf8eb\n\n1 + \u03b7e\n\uf8ec\nRG \u2243 \uf8ed 0\n0\n\n0\n1 + \u03b7\u03bc\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0\n\uf8f7\n0\uf8f8,\n1\n\n\u03b7i = 1\u2212\n\ns\n\nIi\n(i = e, \u03bc),\nI\u03c4\n\n\uf8eb\n\nIi \u2261 exp \uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n1\n8\u03c0 2\n\nln Z\n(MR )\n\nln (M z)\n\n\uf8f6\n\nyi2 dt\uf8f8. (8)\n\uf8f7\n\nWe transform back this neutrino mass matrix RG M \u03bd RG into the basis where the charged\nlepton mass matrix is the democratic one at the EW scale as follows:\n\uf8eb\n\n1+r\n\uf8ec\nT\nF RG M \u03bd RG F \u2243 c\u03bd \uf8ed r\nr\n\nr\n1+\u01eb+r\nr\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\nr\n1 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nr\n\uf8f8 + 2\u03b7R c\u03bd \uf8ed 0 1 0 \uf8f8 ,\n0 0 1\n1+\u03b4+r\n\n2\nr = r \u2212 \u03b7R .\n3\n\n(9)\nHere we take \u03b7R \u2261 \u03b7e \u2243 \u03b7\u03bc , which is a good approximation [9]. Its numerical value depends\non tan \u03b2 as: 10\u22122 , 10\u22123 and 10\u22124 for tan \u03b2 = 60, 10, and 1, respectively. As seen in eq.(4)\nand eq.(9), radiative corrections are absorbed into the original parameters r, \u01eb and \u03b4 in the\nleading order. Thus the structure of the mass matrix is stable against radiative corrections\nalthough our model leads to nearly degenerate neutrinos. Of course, it does not means that\nthe radiative corrections are small.\nWe have obtained the neutrino mass matrix with the large mixing angle MSW solution,\nsin2 2\u03b8\u2299 = 0.65 \u223c 0.97 and \u2206m2\u2299 = 10\u22125 \u223c 10\u22124 eV2 , in the S3L \u00d7 S3R flavor symmetry. The\nstructure of our neutrino mass matrix is found to be stable against radiative corrections. We\nwait for results in KamLAND experiment as well as new solar neutrino data.\n\nReferences\n[1] H.
