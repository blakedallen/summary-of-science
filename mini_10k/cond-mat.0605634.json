At zero gravity the temperature of a freely cooling homogeneous granular\ngas follows a power law in time. How does gravity, which brings inhomogeneity, affect the cooling?\nWe combine molecular dynamics simulations, a numerical solution of hydrodynamic equations and\nan analytic theory to show that a granular gas cooling under gravity undergoes thermal collapse: it\ncools down to zero temperature and condenses on the bottom of the container in a finite time.\nPACS numbers: 45.70.Qj, 47.70.Nd\n\nGranular gas, a low-density fluid of inelastic hard\nspheres, is a simple model of granular flow, and it has\nattracted much attention from physicists [1, 2]. An undriven granular gas loses its kinetic energy via inelastic\ncollisions. In the Homogeneous Cooling State (HCS) the\ntemperature T of a dilute granular gas decays according\nto Haff's law [1], T (t) = T0 (1 + t/t0 )\u22122 , where in two dip\n1/2\nmensions t0 = \u03c0/2 (1 \u2212 r2 ) dn0 T0 is the cooling time,\nn0 is the (constant) number density of the particles, d is\nthe particle diameter and r is the coefficient of normal\nrestitution. The HCS, and deviations from it, provide a\nrich testing ground for the ideas and methods of kinetic\ntheory of granular gases, and it has been investigated\nin many theoretical works, see Ref. [2] and references\ntherein. Direct experimental observation on the HCS is\ndifficult, not the least because of gravity. Therefore it is\nsomewhat surprising that there have been no theoretical\nstudies of the effect of gravity on the free cooling of a\ngranular gas. It is intuitively clear that gravity forces\ngrains to sink to the bottom of the container, where increased density enhances the collision rate and causes\n\"freezing\" of the granulate. However, no quantitative\nanalysis of this process has ever been performed. Here\nwe combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, a numerical solution of granular hydrodynamic equations and\nanalytical theory to develop a detailed quantitative understanding of this cooling process. Our main result is\nthat, in a striking contrast to Haff's law, the gas undergoes thermal collapse: it cools down to zero temperature\nand condenses on the bottom plate in a finite time exhibiting, close to collapse, a previously unknown universal scaling behavior.\nMD simulations. We employed an event-driven algorithm [3] to simulate a free cooling of an initially dilute\ngas of N \u226b 1 identical nearly elastic, 1 \u2212 r \u226a 1, hard\ndisks of unit diameter and mass in a two-dimensional\ncontainer of width Lx and infinite height. The (elastic)\nbottom of the container is at y = 0, the (elastic) side\nwalls are at x = 0 and Lx . Lx is chosen small enough\nso that any macroscopic structure in the lateral direction is suppressed. The gravity acceleration g acts in the\nnegative y direction. Figure 1 shows four snapshots of\n\nt=600\n\n2200\n\n4200\n\n7770\n\nFIG. 1: Snapshots of an event-driven MD simulation at indicated times for N = 5642, Lx = 102 , r = 0.995, T0 = 10 and\ng = 0.01. Only a part of the box is shown.\n\na typical simulation where, at t = 0, particles have a\nMaxwell velocity distribution, and a Boltzmann density\nprofile at constant temperature T0 [4]. Collapse of all\nparticles to the bottom is observed at time tc = 7770.\nThe circles in Fig. 2a show the time history of the simulated total kinetic energy of the gas, normalized to its\nvalue at t = 0. One can see that the total energy drops\nto zero in a finite time. We observed a similar behavior\nin a wide range of parameters, and also for a different,\nnon-isothermal initial state, prepared by replacing the\nelastic bottom plate by a \"thermal\" bottom plate [3] and\nwaiting until a steady state is reached. In the latter case\nthe initial transient is somewhat different, but the energy\ndecay law close to collapse remains the same, see Fig. 2a.\nHydrodynamic theory. The observed energy decay dynamics are remarkably captured by hydrodynamic equations for the number density n(y, t), vertical velocity\nv(y, t) and granular temperature T (y, t). These equations are systematically derivable from the Boltzmann\nequation generalized to account for inelastic collisions of\nhard disks [2]. We assume a dilute gas, an assumption\nwhich becomes invalid close to collapse. Following Ref.\n[7], we rescale the variables using the gravity length scale\n\u03bb = T0 /g and the heat diffusion time td = \u03b5\u22121 (\u03bb/g)1/2 .\nThe scaled parameter \u03b5 = \u03c0 \u22121/2 (Lx /N d) \u226a 1 is of the\norder of the inverse number of layers of grains which form\nafter the particles settle on the bottom.

(1)-(3) numerically in a wide range\nof parameters, using a variable mesh/variable time step\nsolver [9]. The blue solid line in Fig. 2a depicts the sum\nof the thermal energy and macroscopic kinetic energy of\nthe gas versus time for the same parameters and initial\ncondition as in the MD simulation indicated by the circles. The agreement is excellent, and thermal collapse is\nclearly observed [6]. At the very early stage of the cooling\n[with duration of O(\u03c4f )] we observed shock waves which\nform at large heights, cause a transient heating of the gas\nthere, and escape to m = 1 (y = \u221e), see Fig. 2b.\nQuasi-static flow. If \u03b5 \u226a min(1, \u039b\u22122 ) then, after the\nbrief transient, a quasi-static flow sets in. Here the \u03b52 terms in Eqs. (2) and (3) can be neglected, and Eq.\n(2) reduces to the hydrostatic condition \u2202m (nT ) + 1 = 0\nwhich yields nT = 1\u2212m. Substituting n = (1\u2212m)/T into\nEq. (3) and using Eq.

(4) the \u03c9-equation; it was derived, in\nanother context, in Ref. [7].\nWe solved the \u03c9-equation numerically [with the noflux boundary conditions (1 \u2212 m)\u2202m \u03c9 = 0 at m = 0\nand 1], using the same solver [9]. A typical example is\nshown in Fig. 2a. Here we launched the computation\nat scaled time t = 0.04 when the hydrostatic condition\nnT = 1\u2212m already holds well, and used the temperature\nprofile, computed with the full hydrodynamic solver, as\nthe initial condition. One can see that the \u03c9-equation\nprovides a faithful description of the later stage of the\ncooling. Figure 3 shows a different example of the cooling\ndynamics, as described by the \u03c9-equation starting from\n\u03c9(m, t = 0) = 1. Here we show the T - and v-profiles in\nboth Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates. In all simulations thermal collapse is observed at a time tc which\ngoes down as \u039b increases. The collapse occurs simultaneously on the whole Lagrangian interval (0, 1), see Fig.\n3a. As the density n = (1 \u2212 m)/T blows up at t = tc at\nall m \u2208 [0, 1), this Lagrangian interval corresponds to a\nsingle Eulerian point y = 0. Therefore, at time t = tc all\nof the gas condenses on the bottom plate y = 0 and cools\nto a zero temperature [10].\nSeparable solution close to collapse. As Fig. 3d implies, \u03c9(m, t) becomes separable as t \u2192 tc . This remarkable solution can be written as\n\u03c9(m, t) = (tc \u2212 t) Q(m) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Q(m) is determined by the nonlinear ODE\n\u2032\n\n[(1 \u2212 m)Q\u2032 ] \u2212 \u039b2 (1 \u2212 m)Q + Q2 = 0\n\n(6)\n\n(the primes denote m-derivatives) and the boundary conditions (1 \u2212 m) Q\u2032 = 0 at m = 0 and 1. Function Q(m) is\nuniquely determined by \u039b and, at fixed \u039b, can be found\nnumerically by shooting. In addition, we found Q(m)\nperturbatively for small and large \u039b:\n\n\f3\n\nQ(m) =\n\n\u039b4\n\u039b 4 m2\n\u039b2\n\u2212\n+\n+ O(\u039b6 ) .\n2\n16\n8\n\n(7)\n\nWe checked that this solution is in excellent agreement\nwith numerical solutions of the \u03c9-equation at small \u039b.\nII. \u039b2 \u226b 1. Here it is convenient to stretch the Lagrangian coordinate, \u03be = \u039b(1 \u2212 m), and time \u03c4 = \u039bt, so\nthat \u039b drops from the \u03c9-equation\n\u03c9\u2202\u03c4 \u03c9 = \u03be\u2202\u03be2 \u03c9 + \u2202\u03be \u03c9 \u2212 \u03be\u03c9,\n\n(8)\n\nbut enters the integration interval (0, \u039b], whereas the\nboundary condition are \u03be\u2202\u03be \u03c9 = 0. The separable solution is \u03c9(\u03be, \u03c4 ) = (\u03c4c \u2212 \u03c4 )q(\u03be), while the boundary-value\nproblem for q(\u03be) is\n\u2032 \u2032\n\n2\n\n(\u03beq ) \u2212 \u03beq + q = 0,\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03beq = 0 at \u03be = 0, \u039b .\n\n(9)\n\nAt \u03be \u226b 1 q(\u03be) is exponentially small, so one can\ndrop the q 2 -term and obtain qb (\u03be) = C [K0 (\u03be) +\nK1 (\u039b)I1\u22121 (\u039b)I0 (\u03be)] (where K0,1 (\u03be) and I0,1 (\u03be) are the\nmodified Bessel functions), which obeys the boundary\ncondition at \u03be = \u039b. This solution with C = 0.951 agrees\nwell with the full numerical solution already at \u03be > 1,\nsee Fig. 4, and therefore is valid everywhere except the\nthin boundary layer at m \u2192 1. As the q 2 -term originates\nfrom the \u03c9\u2202\u03c4 \u03c9 term in Eq. (8), we realize that, almost\neverywhere, the energy loss at late times is balanced by\nthe heat conduction, while the boundary layer at m \u2192 1\nserves as a dynamic \"bottleneck\" of the cooling.\nOutside of a thin boundary layer near \u03be = \u039b (or\nm = 0), the solution is close to the solution of the same\nequation but on the semi-infinite interval (0, \u221e). The\nlatter one, q\u221e (\u03be), is parameter-free and can be found numerically. The shooting starts at the left boundary \u03be = 0\nwhich is a regular singular point of Eq. (9). We demand\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\nthat q\u221e\n(\u03be = 0) be finite, which yields q\u221e\n(0) = \u2212q\u221e (0)2 .\nThe shooting procedure gives a unique value of q\u221e (0) for\nwhich the solution does not diverge toward +\u221e or \u2212\u221e\nat large \u03be. We find q0 \u2261 q\u221e (0) = 1.633356 . . . ; the respective asymptotic profile q\u221e (\u03be) is the envelope of the\nnumerical profiles q(\u03be) for different \u039b in Fig. 4a.\nEarly dynamics and collapse time. To find the collapse\ntime tc [a free parameter in the separable solution (5)],\none needs to solve the \u03c9-equation with a given initial\ncondition. In general, this can only be done numerically.\nWe obtained analytic estimates of tc , separately for small\nand large \u039b, for \u03c9(m, t = 0) = 1.\nFor \u039b \u226a 1 the separable solution (5) and (7) is valid, at\norder \u039b2 , at any t \u2265 0. This yields the leading-order estimate tc \u2243 2\u039b\u22122 . For \u039b \u226b 1 the initial stage of the cooling dynamics should be addressed separately.

As it can be checked a posteriori, in this\ncase Q(m) = O(\u039b2 ). Furthermore, as the heat diffusion dominates over the inelastic energy loss, the solution must be almost constant on the whole interval\n0 \u2264 m < 1. Therefore, we seek a solution in the form\nQ(m) = \u039b2 Q0 + \u039b4 Q1 (m)+ \u039b6 Q2 (m)+ . . . . Substituting\nthis in Eq.

The red\nstraight line shows the smoothly matched asymptotic separable solution at m = 1 (b).\n\nthat at early times the term \u03be\u2202\u03be2 \u03c9 in Eq. (8) is small compared to the rest of terms. With this term neglected Eq.\n(8) reduces to a first-order equation, \u03c9\u2202\u03c4 \u03c9 \u2212 \u2202\u03be \u03c9 = \u2212\u03be\u03c9,\nwhich is soluble by characteristics.

(10)\npredicts an early-time asymptote \u03c9(\u03be, \u03c4 \u226a 1) = 1 \u2212 \u03be\u03c4\nwhich can be also obtained directly from Eq. (8) with the\nheat conduction neglected completely. The \"bottleneck\"\nof cooling, however, is at large heights, \u03be \u226a 1, where\nthe gas is very dilute. An early-time asymptote there, as\npredicted from Eq. (10), is\n\u03c9 \u2243 1 \u2212 \u03be\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 2 /2 = 1 \u2212 \u039b2 (1 \u2212 m)t \u2212 \u039b2 t2 /2 .\n\n(11)\n\nThe implicit solution (10) breaks down, at a given \u03be, at\ntime \u03c4 \u223c min (1, \u03be \u22121 ), and then the full \u03c9-equation must\nbe solved. Eventually, as \u03c4 approaches \u03c4c , the separable\nsolution (5) emerges.\nWe stress that, at \u039b \u226b 1, the cooling process is highly\nnonuniform, see Fig. 5a and b. For example, at m = 0 a\nrapid initial decay \u03c9 = 1 \u2212 \u039b2 t crosses over, after a short\ntime t \u223c \u039b\u22122 , into a very slow decay \u03c9 = \u039bq(\u039b)(tc \u2212 t),\nas q(\u039b) is exponentially small. Meanwhile, at m = 1 a\nslow initial decay \u03c9 = 1 \u2212 \u03c4 2 /2 crosses over into a rapid\ndecay \u03c9 = q0 (\u03c4c \u2212 \u03c4 ). At t = tc \u03c9 vanishes at all \u03be (that\nis, at y = 0). Note that the dynamics at m = 1 are\nindependent of \u039b in the stretched time \u03c4 = \u039bt\nA good estimate of the collapse time \u03c4c at large \u039b\ncan be obtained by matching, at \u03be = 0, the late-time\nasymptote (\u03c4c \u2212 \u03c4 )q0 with the early-time solution (10),\nsee Fig. 4b. This yields an algebraic equation for \u03c4c :\ni\nh\n(\u03c0/2)1/2 erfi(2\u22121/2 \u03c4c\u22121 ) + q0\u22121 = \u03c4c exp[1/(2\u03c4c2 )] (12)\nwhich has a unique solution \u03c4c \u2243 1.10, or tc \u2243 1.10\u039b\u22121.\nFor comparison, a numerical solution of Eq. (8), for\n\n\f4\nlarge \u039b, with the initial condition \u03c9(\u03be, t = 0) = 1 yields\n\u03c4c = 1.145 which agrees with our estimate to about 4%.\nThe slope of the collapsed curves \u03c9(\u03be = 0, \u03c4 ) for large \u039b\n(Fig. 4b) near \u03c4 = \u03c4c , \u2202\u03c4 \u03c9(\u03be = 0, \u03c4c ) = 1.624, is in very\ngood agreement with the asymptotic value q0 = 1.633356.\nOur predictions of the \u039b-dependence of tc are summa-\n\n\u03c9(0,t)\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n2\n0\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n(a)\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\u039bt\n\n1\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n0.6 0.9\n\u039bt\n\n0\n0\n\n\u039b= 5\n\u039b=10\n\u039b=15\n\n1\n\n4\n\u03c9(1,t)\n\n\u03c9(0,t) 10\n\n5\n\n1\n0.8\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n1.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\u039bt\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nFIG. 5: (a) \u03c9(m = 0, t) at \u039b = 10.

Here we present the results for\n\u039b \u226b 1. In the early stage of cooling the gas density is n(\u03be, \u03c4 ) = (\u03be/\u039b)(1 \u2212 \u03be\u03c4 )\u22122 and velocity v(\u03be, \u03c4 ) =\n\u039b(\u039b \u2212 \u03be)[(\u039b + \u03be)\u03c4 \u2212 2]. Close to collapse the density\nn(\u03be, \u03c4 ) = \u03be(\u03c4c \u2212 \u03c4 )\u22122 q \u22122 (\u03be) blows up as (\u03c4c \u2212 \u03c4 )\u22122 . The\nR\u039b\ngas velocity is v(\u03be, \u03c4 ) = \u22122\u039b(\u03c4c \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u03be [q 2 (\u03be \u2032 )/\u03be \u2032 ] d\u03be \u2032 . At\n\u03c4 < \u03c4c it diverges logarithmically at \u03be = 0 (that is, linearly at y \u2192 \u221e), but vanishes everywhere at \u03c4 = \u03c4c ,\nwhile the mass flux nv blows up at \u03c4 = \u03c4c . Going back\nR\u039b\nto Eulerian coordinate y = (\u03c4c \u2212 \u03c4 )2 \u03be [q 2 (\u03be \u2032 )/\u03be \u2032 ] d\u03be \u2032 , we\nsee that the velocity field is simply v(y, t) = \u22122y/(tc \u2212 t).\nSummary. Our MD simulations and hydrodynamic theory depict a coherent picture of thermal collapse which\ndevelops in the process of a free cooling of a granular\ngas under gravity. One of the signatures of this picture is the universal scaling behavior of the total energy\nE(t) \u223c (tc \u2212 t)2 as t \u2192 tc .\nIt would be interesting to test the quantitative predictions of our theory in experiment. A possible experiment\ncan employ metallic spheres rolling on a slightly inclined\nsmooth surface and driven by a rapidly vibrating bottom\nwall, like in Ref. [11]. After the \"granular gas\" reaches a\nsteady state, one stops the driving and follows the cooling dynamics with a fast camera and a particle tracking\nsoftware. While particle rotation and rolling friction may\nprove important, we expect that the main predictions of\nthe theory, including the scaling behavior of the total\nenergy at t \u2192 tc , will persist.\n\nrized in Fig. 6. The small- and large-\u039b asymptotes are in\nexcellent agreement with numerical results. Returning to\nthe dimensional units, we observe that, at \u039b \u226a 1 the collapse time tc is much longer than the heat diffusion time.\nAt \u039b \u226b 1 tc is of the order of (\u03b5\u039b)\u22121 tf \u223c (1 \u2212 r2 )\u22121/2 tf\n\nLT and DV are grateful to the U.S. Department of Energy for financial support (Grant DE-FG02- 04ER46135).\nBM acknowledges support from the Israel Science Foundation (grant No. 107/05) and from the GermanIsrael Foundation for Scientific Research and Development (Grant I-795-166.10/2003).\n\n[1] P.K.
