As was\nreported in a previous publication from this laboratory, co-chelation stabilizes the dimer to\ncollisional activation, and facilitates asymmetrical zinc ion transfers during fragmentation. In the\ncase of metallothionein, dimers of the holoprotein are found to share zinc ions, while dimers of\nmetallothionein, in which one domain has been denatured, do not. Zinc ions are silent to most\nphysicochemical probes, e.g., NMR and Mossbauer spectroscopies, and the capability of mass\nspectrometry to provide information on zinc complexes has widespread potential application in\nbiochemistry.\n\n2\n\n\fIn recent years electrospray ionization has been very useful for analysis of metal/protein\ncomplexes [1-4]. Applications to metalloproteins have been successful, largely because metal\nions are usually complexed to proteins by strong electrostatic forces, and electrostatic forces are\npreserved and even reinforced in the water-free environment of the gas phase [5,6]. Electrospray\nand nanospray can provide information on identity and stoichiometry, e.g., the nature and number\nof metal ions present, with high mass accuracy and high sensitivity [7]. When relevant,\ninformation can also be obtained on the oxidation state of the metal ion [8,9]. More recently,\ncollisionally induced dissociation (CID) has been used to provide information on cooperative\nbinding within protein complexes, and on overall conformation [10,11]. We have previously\nproposed that CID can be used to distinguish zinc ion sharing or mixed ligand co-chelation in\ncomplexes of metallothionein and glutathione [4].\nMetallothionein (MT) comprises two distinct domains, the N-terminal domain ( -domain)\nin which 9 cysteine residues coordinate three bivalent metal ions and the C-terminal domain ( domain) in which 11 cysteines coordinate four metal ions. Metallothionein functions mainly as a\nzinc ion reservoir, providing zinc ions to other zinc depleted metalloenzymes. Jiang et al [12]\nshowed that each domain reacts differently. The -domain is a better zinc donor than the\n\n-\n\ndomain. It has also been demonstrated experimentally that metallothionein transfers zinc ions to\nother proteins, including proteins with lower zinc ion affinities, via intermolecular complexes[1315]. It seems likely that zinc ions are transferred via rapid formation of intermolecular ligand\nfields [13,16].\nMass spectrometry is one of the few physical techniques that can provide information on\nbiological zinc complexes, which are silent to most physicochemical probes [17]. Recently\nnanospray has been used to demonstrate that metal ions are rapidly redistributed between two\n\n3\n\n\fmolecules of MT, monitoring the scrambling that occurs after rapid mixing of Zn7MT with\nCd7MT [17] Otvos et al. used NMR spectroscopy to provide evidence that this occurs via a\ntransient dimeric intermediate [13]. No transient intermediate dimers could be detected by mass\nspectrometry. However, a stable dimeric complex of methallothionein as been characterized after\nisolation by size-exclusion chromatography, which appears to be stabilized by disulfide bridging\n[17].\nThe stoichiometry of this stable MT dimer in the gas phase is investigated here, and CID is used\nto address the question of interchain co-chelation of zinc ions. Control experiments are performed\nwith a partially denatured MT dimer, to verify the specificity of the observed complexes and the\nvalidity of the CID method for characterizing \"shared\" zinc ions.\n\nExperimental\nMaterials\nRabbit liver metallothionein 2a, zinc atomic absorption standard solution and ammonium\nbicarbonate were obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO). Deionized water (18.2 M\n\nwas obtained\n\nwith a MilliQ (Millipore, Bedford, MA) apparatus. HPLC grade methanol and acetonitrile were\nobtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA).\n\nSample preparation\nRabbit liver metallothionein 2a was purified by reverse phase HPLC and reconstituted\nwith zinc ions, following a published procedure [14]. Briefly, metallothionein is denatured using\nhydrochloric acid and dipicolinic acid, and then the 2a isoform is purified by reverse-phase high\npressure liquid chromatography (discarding the contaminating MT-IIb isoform). After\n\n4\n\n\flyophilization, the holoprotein Zn7MT is reconstituted by the addition of ZnCl2, raising the pH\nslowly under argon to avoid oxidative dimerization. Excess zinc ions are eliminated by\ncentrifugation using 5 kDa cutoff centrifugal ultrafiltration cartridge (Ultrafree, Millipore,\nBedford, MA). Acetic acid (0.1 %) was added to this solution when partial denaturation was\nrequired.\nAn Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Q-Star hybrid quadrupole/time of flight mass\nspectrometer equipped with a Protana (Odense, Denmark) nanoelectropray source was used for\nall the experiments. About 2\n\nl of sample was loaded into a Protana metallized tip using\n\nEppendorf GELoaders 1-10 l (Westbury, NY). The instrument was set to work in the positive\nion mode with an ionization voltage set at 900 V. The declustering potential was varied between\n30 and 100 V. For tandem mass spectrometry, argon was used as collision gas and the collision\nenergy was varied between 20 and 50 V. External calibration was performed using a\npolypropylene glycol 3000 solution (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The quadrupole mass\nfilter was tuned to transmit ions in the 200-2500 m/z range. Simulation of isotopic distributions,\nand calculation of apoprotein monoisotopic and average masses were performed with an ICR2LS v2.66.79 program (EMSL). Determination of protein formulae was performed using\nGPMAW 4.12 (Lighthouse data, Odense, Denmark).\n\n5\n\n\fResults\n\nUnder physiologic conditions (pH 7.4) in ammonium bicarbonate buffer, the ionized\nprotein carrying 7 zinc ions was observed as expected (6569 Da in Figure 1). This mass is in\ngood agreement with the theoretical average mass calculated from the amino acid sequence, plus\nseven zinc ions [7,18]. Excess zinc ions were eliminated before the analysis by ultrafiltration, and\nno nonspecific adducts are detected in the spectra. The narrow charge distribution observed here\n(centered around the 5+ ions) is typical for this stable folded protein [2]. Ions detected at m/z\n1878 are assigned to the stable dimeric form of Zn7-metallothionein carrying 7 protons. This\ndimeric species was found to be stable at relatively high declustering potentials (i.e. 100 V in\nFigure 1).\nWhen the dimeric species carrying fourteen zinc ions was selected for collisional\nactivation 50 V collision energy was required (Figure 2), and two complementary cluster ion\ndistributions appeared, one with a +3 charge state and the other with a +4 charge state. The\nmasses of each series correspond to the monomeric form of the protein with a continuum number\nof zinc ions. Although seven charges cannot be divided equally between the two CID product\nions, the distribution observed indicates that the two polypeptides in the dimer have similar\nconformations and flexibility. The monomeric product ions with three charges carry from 7 to 12\nzinc ions, with the 10 zinc specie as the most abundant. The monomeric protein product ions with\nfour charges carry from 1 to 10 zinc ions. The 4 zinc specie is the most abundant.\nThis experiment was repeated with a solution of metallothionein that had been partially\ndenatured at pH 3.5 by addition of diluted acetic acid (see Experimental). It has been shown\npreviously that the two domains of MT have different stabilities [12]. Below pH 3 both domains\nare unfolded and all zinc ions are released. At pH 3.5 the -domain unfolds and releases three\n6\n\n\fzinc ions, whereas the -domain remains folded, binding four zinc ions. Under this condition the\nmass spectrum displays mainly metallothionein carrying 4 zinc ions (presumably those\ncooperatively bound in the alpha-domain). When a low declustering potential (30 V in Figure 3)\nis used, a dimeric form is also observed, at m/z 1823, (Figure 3), carrying eight zinc ions and\nseven excess protons.\nUnder collisional dissociation (Figure 4), the dimer of partially denatured metallothionein\nis fragmented into MT monomers at two charge states (+4 and +3), each carrying four zinc ions.\nNo evidence for any inter-cluster ion transfer was detected in the decompositon of this dimer.\nElectrostatic interactions involving interstrand co-chelation of multiple zinc ions are\nexpected to be relatively strong, and to stabilize the complex. It should be noted that higher CID\nenergies were required to fragment the dimer of the fully metalated holoprotein, than were\nrequired to fragment the dimer of the partially denatured protein. A collision energy of 50 V was\nrequired to obtain the CID spectrum shown in Figure 2, while 30 V provided the CID spectrum in\nFigure 4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn an earlier study, CID was used to distinguish between Zn7MT complexes with\nglutathione derivatives that are stabilized by co-chelation of zinc ions, and those that are not [4],\nThis distinction is based on differences in the collision energy required for dissociation, and more\nimportantly, on differences in the distribution of zinc ions between the dissociation products. In\nthe present study, differences are observed on both counts in the dissociation of the dimer of fully\nmetalated MT and the dimer of the partially demetalated protein. The disulfide linkage postulated\n\n7\n\n\fin the stable dimer of Zn7MT may contribute to the requirement for higher collision energies for\ndissociation. However, the asymmetric distribution of zinc ions in the products argues strongly\nfor co-chelation of some or all between the two polypeptide strands. Reflecting on the\ndistribution of 10 and 4 zinc ions in the most abundant dissociation products, one can speculate\nthat the three metal ions in each of the labile beta-domains are involved in interstrand ligands to a\nlarger extent than those in the more stable alpha domains, and thus are more readily transferred\nbetween polypeptides. This is also consistent with the absence of interstrand transfer between\ndimers of Zn4MT. Co-chelation and transfer of metal ions from each beta domain would be\nsymmetrically achieved in the head-to-tail conformation predicted for Zn7MT dimers based on\nthe x-ray crystallographic structure [19] and supported by recent theoretical studies [20].\n\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors thank Dr X.
