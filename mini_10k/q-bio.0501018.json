A well-known and studied example of this fact is\nthe increased mutation of cytosine to thymine in CpG dinucleotides in vertebrates\n(Coulondre et.al., 1978; Razin and Riggs, 1980). This process is triggered by\n1\n\n\fthe methylation of cytosine in CpG followed by deamination, and mutation from\nCpG to TpG or CpA (on the reverse strand). Due to this process the number of\nCpG is decreased while the number of TpG and CpA is larger than expected from\nindependently evolving nucleotides. Most of the deviant dinucleotide odds ratios\n(dinucleotide frequencies normalized for the base composition) in the human\ngenome can be explained by the presence of the CpG methylation deamination\nprocess (Arndt et.al., 2002). Biochemical studies in the 1970s already compared\nthese odds ratios for different genomes and different fractions of genomic DNA\n(Russell et.al., 1976; Russell and Subak-Sharpe, 1977) and concluded that these\nratios are a remarkably stable property of genomes. In the following Karlin\nand coworkers (Karlin and Burge, 1995; Karlin and Mr\u00e1zek, 1997; Karlin et.al.,\n1997) elaborated and expanded these observations, showing that the pattern of\ndinucleotide abundance constitutes a genomic signature in the sense that it\nstable across different parts of a genome and generally similar between related\norganisms. Since this signature is also present in non-coding and intergenic DNA\nit is very promising to study neighbor dependent mutation and fixation processes\n(we refer to the effective process as the substitution process) to understand\nthe evolution of neutral DNA. However, to pursue on this track new models\nfor nucleotide substitutions that extends those which only capture neighbor\nindependent nucleotide substitutions (see (Lio and Goldman, 1998) for a review)\nhave to be formulated (see also (Arndt et.al., 2002; Siepel and Haussler, 2004;\nLunter and Hein, 2004)).\nRecently a framework to include such neighbor dependent processes has\nbeen introduced (Arndt et.al., 2002). The framework itself is capable to include\nany type of neighbor dependent process and was already successfully applied\nto model the CpG methylation deamination process in vertebrates (Arndt et.al.,\n2003). Although these models are mathematically more complicated they however allow a quantitative analysis of neighbor dependent processes and to make\nreliable estimations on other properties e.g. the stationary GC-content. Here we\nwill extend this framework and discuss the inclusion of more neighbor dependent\nsubstitutions and how one can infer their relevance without prior knowledge on\nthe underlying biochemical processes. In vertebrates the CpG methylation deamination process is the predominant nucleotide substitution process. Its rate is\nabout 40 times higher than this of a transversion and its history can actually\nreconstructed for the last 250 Myr (Arndt et.al., 2003). One reason for this\nsubstitution frequency being so high is that in vertebrates CpG methylation is\nalso used in gene regulation, as methylated regions of the genome are not transcribed. Consequently, CpG's in these regions often mutate. We know already\nthat also other vertebrates use methylation in the same way but do not know\nabout the quantitative extent their genomes are methylated. The situation is\nstill rather unclear in other kingdoms of life. Although we clearly see signatures\nof neighbor dependent substitution processes, we do not know the responsible\nprocesses and their rates.\nTo present our method we study neighbor dependent substitutions in human\n(Homo sapiens), zebrafish (Danio rerio) and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster).\nIn all these studies we first try to model the observed nucleotide substitutions\n2\n\n\fwith a model which does not include any neighbor dependent nucleotide substitutions (12 free rate parameters) and then ask the question which neighbor dependent substitution process one would have to include to describe the observed\ndata best. The idea is to capture the most of the observed substitutions by single nucleotide substitutions independent of the neighboring bases and then to\ninclude neighbor dependent substitutions one by one to generate a better model\nwith the least number of parameters. Processes are added in the order of their\nability to describe the observed data better. Naturally, the addition of any further process (together with one rate parameter) into a model will increase the\nlikelihood of this model to describe the observed data. In order not to over-fit\nthe data we use a likelihood ratio test to judge whether the addition of further\nprocess is justified. The strength of our approach is to come up with a model\nwith fewer parameters that still captures the essential neighbor dependent nucleotide substitution processes. This prevents over-fitting the model to given\ndata and eases the quantitative estimation of a smaller number of parameters.\nThe rest of the paper organizes as follows. In the next section we will describe\ndetails of our method. There is no need to implement the described procedure\nfor readers who want to analyze their own sequences, since we are running a\npublic web server at http://evogen.molgen.mpg.de/server/substitution-analysis.\nAt this site one is able to upload sequence data and perform the presented\nanalysis. First applications of such an analysis will be presented in the results\nsection.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nMethod\nThe substitution model\n\nIn total there are 12 distinct neighbor independent substitution processes of a\nsingle nucleotides by another; four of them are so-called transitions that interchange a purine with a purine or a pyrimidine with a pyrimidine. The remaining\neight processes are the so-called transversions that interchange a purine with a\npyrimidine and vice versa. The rates of these processes, \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2, will be denoted\nr\u03b1\u03b2 , where \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 {A, C, G, T} denote a nucleotide. On top of these 12 processes\nwe want to consider also neighbor dependent processes of the kind \u03ba\u03bb \u2192 \u03ba\u03c3 and\n\u03ba\u03bb \u2192 \u03c3\u03bb where the right or left base of a di-nucleotide changes, respectively.\nThere might be several of those processes present in our model, their rates will\nbe denoted by r\u03ba\u03bb\u03ba\u03c3 or r\u03ba\u03bb\u03c3\u03bb . We do not consider processes where both nucleotides of a dinucleotide change at the same time. In vertebrates, the most\nimportant neighbor dependent process to consider is the substitution of cytosine\nin CpG resulting in TpG or CpA. Its rate is about 40 times higher than this of a\ntransversion (Arndt et.al., 2003). This process is triggered by the methylation\nand subsequent deamination of cytosine in CpG pairs. It is commonly (and erroneously) assumed that this process only affects CpG dinucleotides. However,\nthis is not the case as it has been shown (Arndt et.al., 2002).\nThe model is parameterized by the substitution rates and the length of the\n\n3\n\n\ftime span, dt, the respective substitution processes acted upon the sequence,\nwhich would in our case be the time between the observation of an ancestral\nsequence and its daughter sequence, T . We have the freedom to rescale time\nand measure it in units of T . In this case, the time span is dt = 1 and with\nthis choice the substitution rates are equal to the substitution frequencies giving the number of nucleotide substitutions per bp. In the simplest case our\nmodel includes neighbor independent processes only and is parameterized by\n12 substitution frequencies. For each additional neighbor dependent process we\ngain one additional parameter. The set of all these substitution frequencies will\nbe denoted by {r}. The number of parameters can actually be reduced by a\nfactor of two when one considers substitutions along neutrally evolving DNA.\nIn this case we cannot distinguish the two strands of the DNA and therefore\nthe substitution rates are reverse complement symmetric, e.g. the rate for the\nsubstitution C\u2192A is equal to the rate for the substitution G\u2192T (in the following\nwe will denote this process by C : G \u2192 A : T, for the rates we have rCA = rGT ).\nIn order to facilitate the subsequent maximum likelihood analysis we need\nto compute the probability, P{r} (*\u03b2 * |\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 ), that the base \u03b12 flanked by \u03b11\nto the left and by \u03b13 to the right, changes into the base \u03b2 for given substitution\nfrequencies {r}. This probability can easily calculated by numerically solving\nthe time evolution of the probability to find three bases p(\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3; t) at time t,\nwhich is given by the Master equation and can be written as the following set\nof differential equations:\n\u2202\np(\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3; t) =\n\u2202t\n\nX\n\n[r\u01eb\u03b1 p(\u01eb\u03b2\u03b3; t) + r\u01eb\u03b2 p(\u03b1\u01eb\u03b3; t) + r\u01eb\u03b3 p(\u03b1\u03b2\u01eb; t)]\n\n\u01eb\u2208{A,C,G,T}\n\n+\n\nX\n\nr\u01eb\u01eb\u2032 \u03b1\u03b2 p(\u01eb\u01eb\u2032 \u03b3; t) +\n\n\u01eb\u01eb\u2032\n\nX\n\nr\u01eb\u01eb\u2032 \u03b2\u03b3 p(\u03b1\u01eb\u01eb\u2032 ; t),\n\n(1)\n\n\u01eb\u01eb\u2032\n\nwhere the rate parameters with the equal initial and final state, r\u03b1\u03b1 and r\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 ,\nare defined by\nX\nX\n(2)\nr\u03b1\u03b2\u01eb\u01eb\u2032 ,\nr\u03b1\u01eb , r\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\nr\u03b1\u03b1 = \u2212\n\u01eb6=\u03b1\n\n(\u01eb\u01eb\u2032 )6=(\u03b1\u03b2)\n\nand rates of neighbor dependent substitution processes not included into the\nmodel are take to be zero.\nabove definitions guarantee the conservation of\nP The\n\u2202\nthe total probability, \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2202t\np(\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3; t) = 0, since the total influx is balanced\nby an appropriate outflux of probability. The first three terms on the r.h.s. in\nEq. (1) describe single nucleotide substitutions on the three sites whereas the\nlast two sums (which are summed over all pairs of nucleotides) represent the\nneighbor dependent processes at the sites (1, 2) and (2, 3), respectively. To\ndescribe the evolution of three nucleotides \u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 , these differential equations\nhave to be solved for initial conditions of the form\n\u001a\n1 if (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) = (\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 )\np(\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3; t = 0) =\n(3)\n0 otherwise.\n4\n\n\fAfter numerically iterating the above differential equations using the RungeKutta algorithm (Press et.al., 1992) we get the above transition probability as\nX\np(\u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 ; t = 1) .\n(4)\nP{r} (*\u03b22 * |\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 ) =\n\u03b21 \u03b23\n\nThe above iteration has to be carried out 64 times for all possible combinations\nof initial bases \u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 . After each iteration 4 of the transition probabilities\nP{r} (*\u03b2 * |\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 ) with \u03b2 = A, C, G, or T can be computed. Note, that the above\nset of differential equations can easily extended to describe systems of length\nN > 3. In this case one has to solve for 4N functions p(\u03b11 \u03b12 . . . \u03b1N ; t).\n\n2.2\n\nEstimation of substitution frequencies\n\nOne can estimate all the above mentioned substitution frequencies from real sequence data by comparing a pair of ancestral \u03b1\n~ = \u03b11 \u03b12 . . . \u03b1N and daughter sequence \u03b2~ = \u03b21 \u03b22 . . . \u03b2N , where the daughter sequence represents the state of the\nancestral sequence after the substitution processes acted upon it for some time.\nNote that we do not assume any other properties regarding to the nucleotide\nor dinucleotide distributions of the sequences. Especially, the two sequences\ndo not need to be in their stationary state with respect to the substitution\nmodel. [In practice, these pairs of ancestral and daughter sequences can be\nobtained in various ways. One very fruitful approach is to take alignments of\nrepetitive sequences, which can be found in various genomes due to the activity\nof retroviruses. Such repetitive elements have entered these genomes during\nshort periods in evolution. Hence all copies of such elements in a genome have\nbeen subject to nucleotide substitutions for the same time and accumulated\ncorresponding amounts of changes. Various such repetitive elements and their\nrespective alignment to the once active master (which is taken to be the ancestral sequence (Arndt et.al., 2003)) can be identified using the RepeatMasker,\nhttp://www.repeatmasker.org.]\nThe log likelihood that a sequence \u03b2~ evolved from a master sequence \u03b1\n~ under\na given substitution model parameterized by the substitution frequencies {r} is\ngiven by\nlog L{r}\n\n=\n\n~ \u03b1)\nlog P{r} (\u03b2|~\n\n\u2248\n\nlog\n\n=\n\nL\u22121\nY\ni=2\n\nX\n\nP{r} (*\u03b2i * |\u03b1i\u22121 \u03b1i \u03b1i+1 )\n\n\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 \u03b22\n\nN (\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 \u2192 *\u03b22 *) log P{r} (*\u03b22 * |\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 ) .\n\n(5)\n\n~ \u03b1) is the probability of the evolution of the sequence \u03b1\n~\nwhere P{r} (\u03b2|~\n~ into \u03b2.\nThis probability can very well be approximated by the product in the second\nline. This is due to the fact that the correlations induced by the substitutional\nprocesses are very short ranged (Arndt et.al., 2002). We therefore take into\n5\n\n\faccount the identities of bases and the dynamics on the nearest neighbors to\nthe left and to the right, and neglect those on the next nearest neighbors and\nbeyond. For most applications this approximation turns out to be sufficient\nsince estimated substitution frequencies deviate less than 1% from their actual\nvalues (see below). Note that this approximation is even exact in the absence\nof neighbor dependent substitution processes. The numbers N (\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 \u2192 *\u03b22 *)\ndenotes the counts of observations of a base substitution from \u03b12 (flanked by\n\u03b11 to the left and \u03b13 to the right) to \u03b22 .\n~\nTo estimate the substitution frequencies {r\u22c6 } for a given pair of \u03b1\n~ and \u03b2\nor given numbers N (\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 \u2192 *\u03b22 *) we have to maximize the above likelihood\nby adjusting the substitution frequencies. This can easily be done using Powell's method (Press et.al., 1992) while taking care of boundary conditions (Box,\n1966), i.e. the positivity of the substitution frequencies.\n\n0.6\n\nsubstitution frequency / GC-content\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\nGC-content\nCpG->CpA/TpG\nG:C->A:T\nA:T->G:C\ntransversion\n\n~\n~\n\n0.08\n\n~\n~\n\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n100\n\n1k\n\n10 k\n\n100 k\nsequence length\n\n1M\n\n10 M\n\n100 M\n\nFigure 1: Plot of the estimated frequencies and their standard deviation (from 500 measurements) for randomly drawn sequences of various length.

In general we do not know or cannot infer these real\nfrequencies otherwise. In order to be able to analyze the uncertainty of frequency\nestimates from finite sequences we synthetically (in silico) generate pairs of ancestral and daughter sequences using known substitution processes and rates\n{r\u0302}. In the following section we include just one neighbor dependent substitution process, namely the CpG-methylation deamination process, CpG\u2192CpA/TpG,\nwhich plays a predominant role in the analysis of nucleotide substitutions in vertebrates. The nucleotides of the ancestral sequences \u03b1\n~ (of length N ) have been\nchosen randomly with equal probability from the 4 nucleotides. Subsequently,\nthe ancestral sequence was synthetically aged and we applied substitutions using a Monte Carlo algorithm as described in (Arndt et.al., 2002) yielding the\n~ The resulting pair of sequences is then analyzed using the above\nsequence \u03b2.\nprocedure to get estimates of the rates {r\u22c6 }. We repeated this experiment 500\ntimes and got estimates for the means {r\u0304\u2217 } and standard deviation {\u2206r\u2217 } of\nthese measurements. In addition we computed the stationary GC-content from\neach set of substitution frequencies (Arndt et.al., 2002). Results of this analysis\nare presented in Figure 1 where we show the mean and standard deviation of estimated rates for different length of sequences N . The transversion frequencies\nwere chosen to be 0.01, the frequency of the A:T\u2192G:C transition to be 0.03, that\nof the G:C\u2192A:T transition to be 0.05, and that of the CpG\u2192CpA/TpG transition\n\n7\n\n\f10\n\nCpG->CpA/TpG\nG:C->A:T\nA:T->G:C\ntransversions\n\nfrequency\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0.0001\n0.0001\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n0.1\nlength of time interval\n\n1\n\nFigure 3:\n\nA plot of the estimated frequencies for various degrees of sequence divergence.\nThe dotted lines give expected values of the frequencies. The sequence length has been chosen\nto be N = 107 .\n\nto be 0.4, as indicated by the doted lines in Figure 1. This choice of frequencies\nmimics the relative strength of the substitution process as they are observed in\nthe human genome. As can be seen the uncertainty of observed substitution frequencies correlates positively with the substitution frequencies and negatively\nwith the length of the sequences.\nTo further quantify these uncertainties and discuss their dependence on various quantities we plotted the deviations {|r\u0304\u2217 \u2212 r\u0302|} and the standard deviations\n{\u2206r\u2217 } as a function of\u221athe sequence length N in Figure 2. The standard deviations decrease with 1/ N . In the absence of neighbor dependent substitutions\nand for ancestral sequences with equally probable nucleotides the standard deviation for reverse complement symmetric frequencies can actually be calculated\nto be\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n2r\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2217\n\u2206r\u03b1\u03b2\n=\n(6)\nN\nas long as all frequencies r \u226a 1. Corresponding lines are presented also in Figure 2 and fit the observed deviations well. The deviation for neighbor dependent\nprocesses such as the process CpG\u2192CpA/TpG can be computed to be of the order\nof:\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n8r\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\n\u2217\n\u2206r\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\n=\n(7)\nN\nNote, that for r \u226a 1 these errors stem only from the stochastic nature of the\nunderlying substitutional process and are not due to approximations used during\n8\n\n\f~ as described in\nour maximum likelihood analysis of the sequence pairs \u03b1\n~ and \u03b2\nthe previous section.\nThe deviations of the observed\nfrom the real frequencies {|r\u0304\u2217 \u2212 r\u0302|} (see Fig\u221a\nure 2) also decrease with 1/ N and are always bounded from above by {\u2206r\u2217 }.\nNote, that the estimates of substitution frequencies are very precise, although we\nused an approximation when deriving the likelihood in Eq. (5). This property\ndoes not hold true for neighbor dependent processes in general. For instance,\nwe observe small (below 1%, data not shown) but systematic deviations of the\nestimated substitution frequencies if we include the process ApA/TpT\u2192CpA/TpG.\nIn this case, one should also take into account the identity and dynamics of\nnucleotides on next nearest neighbor sites and the associated neighbor dependent processes. One would have to introduce higher order corrections in Eq.\n(5). This is true because of overlapping initial states of the neighbor dependent\nprocess, i.e. two ApA's in a triplet AAA. However, such corrections do not have to\nbe considered for the CpG\u2192CpA/TpG process. For a given CpG, the next nearest\nneighbor dependent process might only occur on a neighboring CpG, which in\ncontrast to ApA's cannot overlap with the given CpG. Hence correlations to the\nnext CpG are even smaller, which makes the estimation of substitution frequencies neglecting such correlations very precise. In the absence of any neighbor\ndependent process there is no approximation involved to compute the likelihood\nin Eq. (5) and therefore estimates will be asymptotically exact for N \u2192 \u221e.\nThe above formulas for the standard deviation, Eqs. (6) and (7), lose their\nvalidity if any one of the frequencies is of the order of one. However, the standard\ndeviations are still decreasing with increasing sequence length. In Figure 3 we\npresent estimated frequencies from sequences of various degrees of divergence.\nThe substitution rates have been chosen in the ratios 1:3:5:40 for the transversions, the A:T\u2192G:C transition, the G:C\u2192A:T transition, and the CpG\u2192CpA/TpG\nprocess. On the horizontal axis we plot the length of the time interval the ancestral sequenced (of length N = 107 ) has been aged. The dotted lines give the\nreal substitution frequencies, which are the products of the corresponding rates\nand the length of the time interval. As long as not all substitution frequencies\nare greater than one (to the left of the dashed vertical line in Figure 3) the substitution frequencies can faithfully estimated, even if single frequencies exceed\none (the dashed horizontal line). If all substitution frequencies are of the order\nof or larger than one, the estimation of substitution frequencies is not possible\nanymore (to the right of the dashed vertical line). In this case, more or less all\nnucleotides underwent one or more substitution processes making it impossible\nto estimate the frequencies of the underlying processes.\nIn reality however, the nucleotides in the ancestral sequence will not be randomly distributed with equal probability from the 4 nucleotides (as assumed\nabove). On top of that genomic sequences will show non-trivial dinucleotide\ndistributions, i.e. neighboring bases are not independent and the dinucleotide\nfrequencies f\u03b1\u03b2 will deviate from the product of nucleotide frequencies f\u03b1 f\u03b2\n(Karlin and Burge, 1995). Both these factors will influence the deviations between the observed and the real substitution frequencies and in those cases the\nabove formulas (6) and (7) do not hold anymore. We also expect additional\n9\n\n\ferrors due to the presence of unaccounted neighbor dependent processes. Depending on the magnitude of the rates for such processes the errors can get quite\nsignificant as discussed below. To exclude the latter type of errors one actually has to try to incorporate additional neighbor dependent processes and judge\nwhether their inclusion is actually relevant (as discussed in the next subsection).\nFor genomic applications, it is further not possible to repeat the measurements of substitution frequencies for different sets of sequences to get an estimate of the typical errors. However, one can still get estimates on the expected standard deviation from bootstrapping the available data. One has to\nresample the available data drawing randomly and with replacement N pairs\nof aligned ancestral and daughter nucleotides (keeping the information of the\nancestral base identity to the left and to the right) and generate a list of counts\nN (\u03b11 \u03b12 \u03b13 \u2192 *\u03b22 *) which then will be used to maximize the likelihood and\nestimate the substitution frequencies as described above. One repeats this resampling procedure M times and from the M estimates of the substitution frequencies and stationary GC-content calculates their standard deviation, which\ngives the statistical error due to the limited amount of sequence data. We found\nthat M = 500 samples are sufficient to estimate those errors (data not shown).\n\n2.4\n\nExtending the model to include additional processes\n\nNext we address how one can extend a given substitution model and include\nadditional neighbor dependent processes to maximize the potential of such a\nmodel to describe the observed data. With the inclusion of additional neighbor\ndependent processes the likelihood of a model {r\u2032 } will in any case be greater\nthan the one of the original model {r}. This is true because the models are\nnested and one has one more free parameter to explain the given data. To test\nwhether the inclusion of a new parameter is justified we employ the likelihood\nratio test for nested models. Let \u03bb = L{r} /L{r\u2032 } be the likelihood ratio, then\n\u22122 log \u03bb has an asymptotic chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal\nto the difference in the numbers of free parameters of the two models, which in\nour case is one (Ewens and Grant, 2001).\nIn practice we extend a given substitution model in turn by one out of the\n4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 96 possible neighbor dependent processes. Out of those extended\nmodels we choose the best one, i.e. the one with the highest likelihood L{r\u2032 } .\nSince the best is chosen out of a finite set of possibilities, we have to account\nfor multiple testing and use a Bonferroni correction. Hence we require that\n\u22122 log \u03bb > 15 to have significance on the 5% level1 . We confirmed this conservative threshold also by simulations using sequences that have been synthetically\nmutated according to a known model.\n\n10\n\n\fA:T\u2192C:G\nA:T\u2192T:A\nC:G\u2192G:C\nC:G\u2192A:T\nA:T\u2192G:C\nC:G\u2192T:A\nCpG\u2192CpA/TpG\nCpG\u2192CpC/GpG\nTpT/ApA\u2192TpG/CpA\nstationary GC-content\n\u22122 log \u03bb\n\n6 parameter\nmodel\n0.012\n0.010\n0.016\n0.015\n0.036\n0.158\n\n7 parameter\nmodel\n0.012\n0.011\n0.016\n0.014\n0.036\n0.059\n0.618\n\n8 parameter\nmodel\n0.011\n0.011\n0.012\n0.014\n0.036\n0.060\n0.627\n0.029\n\n0.213\n\n0.341\n7.7*106\n\n0.340\n1.3*105\n\n9 parameter\nmodel\n0.007\n0.011\n0.012\n0.014\n0.036\n0.060\n0.624\n0.029\n0.013\n0.339\n9.6*104\n\nTable 1:\n\nEstimates for substitution frequencies for nested models of nucleotide substitution\nin human AluSx repeats. Given are the substitution frequencies per bp in the time span\nafter the insertion of the AluSx repeats into the human genome. In the last row we note the\n\u22122 log \u03bb where \u03bb is the likelihood ratio of the model and the one with one less parameter in\nthe column to the left.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nAs a first test, we applied the described method to identify and measure neighbor dependent substitution processes to human genomic data. We took the\ncopies of the AluSx SINEs that have been found in a genome-wide search of the\nhuman genome (release v20.34c.1 at ensembl.org from April 1st, 2004). These\nelements are assumed to have evolved neutrally and therefore the substitution\nprocess is reverse complement symmetric. Results are presented in Table 1. In\nthe first column of data we give estimations for the 6 neighbor independent\nsingle nucleotide substitutions. We subsequently tested 48 possible extension of\nthis simple substitution model by one additional neighbor dependent substitution process together with its reverse complement symmetric process (Note that\nin this case only 48 extensions have to be considered). As expected (and shown\nin the second column in Table 1) the CpG methylation deamination process\n(CpG\u2192CpA/TpG) turns out give the best improvement with \u22122 log \u03bb = 7.7 * 106 ,\nwhich is clearly above the threshold of 15. The substitution frequency of this\nprocess is about 45 times higher than that of a transversion. Extending the\nmodel from 6 to 7 parameters and including the CpG\u2192CpA/TpG process, mostly\naffects the estimate for the G:C\u2192A:T transition, which decreases about a factor\nthree. Please also note that subsequently the estimation of the stationary GCcontent from those rates rises from 21% for the 6 parameter model to 34% for\nthe 7 parameter model. This reveals that estimates of substitution frequencies\nand the stationary nucleotide composition are very much affected by the underlying substitution model. Substantial deviations can be observed when the\nsubstitution model does not include all relevant process, as it the case for the 6\nparameter model for nucleotide substitutions in the human lineage. In principle\nR 15 2\n1\nNote that\n\n0\n\n\u03c71 (x) dx = 0.99989 > 1 \u2212 0.05/96\n\n11\n\n\fthere can be even more neighbor dependent processes, which we have to account\nfor. We therefore try to incorporate an additional process besides the already\nfound one.\nThe second process that needs to be included to improve the model is the\nsubstitution of CpG\u2192CpC/GpG (\u22122 log \u03bb = 1.3 * 105 ). This is another CpG based\nprocess and probably also triggered by the methylation of cytosine. However, the\nsubstitution frequency is about 30 times smaller than this of the CpG\u2192CpA/TpG\nprocess. The third process is then the substitution TpT/ApA\u2192TpG/CpA (\u22122 log \u03bb =\n9.6 * 104 ). The instability of the TpT dinucleotide does not come as a surprise\nhere, since two consecutive thymine nucleotides tend to form a thymine photodimer T <> T. This process is one of the major lesions formed in DNA during\nexposure to UV light (Douki et.al., 1997).\nNext we turn to the analysis of the DANA repeats in zebrafish (Danio rerio).\nResults are presented in Table 2. Again we start with a model just comprising single nucleotide transversions and transitions. As observed in human the\ntransitions occur more often than transversions and there is a strong A:T bias\nin the single nucleotide substitutions. Zebrafish being a vertebrate also utilizes methylation as an additional process to regulate gene expression. As a\nconsequence we observe a higher mutability of the CpG dinucleotide due to the\ndeamination process also in zebrafish. However the substitution frequency for\nthe CpG\u2192CpA/TpG process is in zebrafish only about 8 times higher than this of\na transversion suggesting that the degree of methylation is generally lower than\nin human.\n\nA:T\u2192C:G\nA:T\u2192T:A\nC:G\u2192G:C\nC:G\u2192A:T\nA:T\u2192G:C\nC:G\u2192T:A\nCpG\u2192CpA/TpG\nCpA/TpG\u2192CpG\nCpG\u2192CpC/GpG\nstationary GC-content\n\u22122 log \u03bb\n\n6 parameter\nmodel\n0.024\n0.041\n0.037\n0.029\n0.073\n0.151\n\n7 parameter\nmodel\n0.025\n0.041\n0.036\n0.029\n0.074\n0.111\n0.274\n\n8 parameter\nmodel\n0.026\n0.041\n0.036\n0.028\n0.046\n0.105\n0.331\n0.100\n\n0.349\n\n0.374\n2.9*105\n\n0.335\n1.6*105\n\n9 parameter\nmodel\n0.026\n0.041\n0.023\n0.028\n0.046\n0.107\n0.328\n0.097\n0.096\n0.337\n1.1*105\n\nTable 2:\n\nEstimates for substitution frequencies for nested models of nucleotide substitution\nin DANA repeats from Danio rerio.\n\nWe also investigated non-vertebrate sequence data. As an example we\npresent here the analysis of the DNAREP1 DM repeat in Drosophila melanogaster\n(Table 3). The case to include neighbor dependent process is in this clearly not\nas strong as for vertebrate genomes. The values of \u22122 log \u03bb are 3 orders of\nmagnitude smaller but still above threshold for the first 3 processes which are\nchosen by our procedure to be included into a model for nucleotide substitutions in fly. The first such process is the substitution TpA\u2192TpT/ApA. Although\n12\n\n\fthe corresponding substitution frequency is lower than all the single nucleotide\ntransitions and transversions, the dinucleotide frequencies in the stationary state\ndeviate up to 10% from their neutral expectation under a neighbor independent\nsubstitution model (data not shown). Therefore even processes with a small\ncontribution to the overall substitutions have a large influence on the observed\npatterns of dinucleotide frequencies or genomic signatures and therefore may\nvery well be solely responsible for the generation of such pattern in different\nspecies.\n\nA:T\u2192C:G\nA:T\u2192T:A\nC:G\u2192G:C\nC:G\u2192A:T\nA:T\u2192G:C\nC:G\u2192T:A\nTpA\u2192TpT/ApA\nTpC/GpA\u2192TpT/ApA\nGpT/ApC\u2192GpC\nstationary GC-content\n\u22122 log \u03bb\n\n6 parameter\nmodel\n0.038\n0.052\n0.034\n0.074\n0.052\n0.108\n\n7 parameter\nmodel\n0.038\n0.045\n0.034\n0.074\n0.052\n0.108\n0.029\n\n8 parameter\nmodel\n0.038\n0.045\n0.034\n0.074\n0.052\n0.098\n0.028\n0.036\n\n0.330\n\n0.330\n853\n\n0.328\n592\n\n9 parameter\nmodel\n0.038\n0.045\n0.034\n0.074\n0.047\n0.098\n0.028\n0.035\n0.021\n0.326\n40\n\nTable 3:\n\nEstimates for substitution frequencies for nested models of nucleotide substitution\nin DNAREP1 DM transposable element from Drosophila melanogaster.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nWe presented a framework to identify the existence and measure the rates of\nneighbor dependent nucleotide substitution processes. We discussed the extension of models of nucleotide substitutions in human and included more neighbor\ndependent processes besides the well-known CpG methylation deamination process (Arndt et.al., 2002). We could also show that the CpG methylation deamination is the predominant substitution process in zebrafish, while it does not\nplay a role in fruit fly. We exemplified our method using sequence data from one\nparticular subfamily of repeats from these three organisms. In the case of the\nhuman genome a much more thorough analysis on various families of repeats\nhave been presented in (Arndt et.al., 2003). A similar study, which also would\nhave to include also neighbor dependent substitutions, for other species will further broaden our knowledge about the molecular processes that are responsible\nfor nucleotide mutations and their fixation.\nAcknowledgment We thank Nadia Singh and Dmitri Petrov (Stanford)\nfor kindly providing sequence data on the DNAREP1 DM repeat in Drosophila\nmelanogaster.\n\n13\n\n\fReferences\nArndt, P.
