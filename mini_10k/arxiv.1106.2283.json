It is, therefore, natural to compare these two\nclasses of superconductors, which might help unravel the\npuzzles of high Tc superconductivity. However, significantly distinct properties have been demonstrated in the\nFeSCs,1 including that (i) most of the parent compounds\nof FeSCs are typical 'bad metal' instead of a Mott insulator as found in the cuprates; (ii) the FeSCs are a\nmulti-band system, which seems to favor a s\u00b1 pairing\nstate rather than a d -wave state; (iii) both the FeSCs\nand the cuprates possess a very large upper critical field,\nbut the FeSCs show nearly isotropic Hc2 at low temperatures despite of their layered crystal structures. Clarification of the electronic coupling strength in FeSCs is\nthe basis for establishing a pertinent theory of superconductivity. Various approaches, either based on the Fermi\nsurface nesting2 or started from the proximity to a Mottinsulator3 were initially proposed to reveal the physics\nof iron pnictides, but no consensus has been reached.\nRecently, dual characters of localized and itinerant 3delectrons were theoretically proposed4 and experimentally shown in some iron pnictides.5,6 To reveal the nature of magnetism and superconductivity in FeSCs and\ncompare it with the high Tc cuprates, it remains highly\ndesired to search for FeSCs nearby a Mott insulator.\nVery recently a new class of FeSCs, AFex Se2 (A=K,7\nCs,8 Rb,9 (Tl1\u2212y Ky )10 and (Tl1\u2212y Rby )11 ), were discov-\n\nered with Tc up to \u223c33K. Remarkably different from\nthe iron pnictides, superconductivity in iron selenides\nseems to develop from an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator with a rather high N\u00e9el temperature.10\u201315 In these\ncompounds, one may tune the interplay of superconductivity and magnetism by changing the Fe-vacancy\norder.10,14,15 Furthermore, the reported ARPES experiments on iron selenides showed that an isotropic superconducting gap emerges around the electron pocket at\nM point but the hole band centered at \u0393 point sinks below the Fermi level.16\u201318 This is in sharp contrast to that\nof the iron pnictide superconductors, in which both holeand electron-pockets, connected with a nesting wave vector, were experimentally observed.19 It is, therefore, of\ngreat interest to find out whether the iron selenide superconductors represent a new type of FeSCs (e.g., similar to the high Tc cuprates) or remain similar to other\niron pnictides. In any case, the iron selenide superconductors may provide an alternative example for studying\nthe pairing mechanisms of high Tc superconductivity, in\nparticular for the FeSCs. To elucidate the above issues, it\nis highly important to compare the main superconducting parameters of the iron selenides with those of the iron\npnictides, and also among the iron selenide series.\nIn this article, we report measurements of the electrical\nresistivity in both a pulsed magnetic field and a DC magnetic field for the single-crystalline Tl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 .\nIt is found that Tl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 shows a very large\nHkc\nH\u22a5c\n(18K)\u2243\nupper critical field (\u03bc0 Hc2 (0K) \u2243 60T, \u03bc0 Hc2\n60T) with a moderate anisotropic parameter \u03b3 (\u03b3 =\nHkc\nH\u22a5c\nHc2\n/Hc2 ), remarkably resembling those of iron pnictide superconductors.20\u201325 On the other hand, the super-\n\n\f2\nconducting transition of Tl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 is substantially broadened in a magnetic field, indicating significant\ncontributions of thermally activated flux flow in the vortex state.\n\n)Fe\n\n0.42\n\nSe\n\n1.72\n\n2\n\n#1\n\n154K\n\n6\n\ncm)\n\n8\n\n3\n\n(m\n\ncm)\n\n10\n\n4\n\n2\n\nT\n\nT\n\n0\n\n=33.5K\n\nc\n\n1\n0\n30\n\n2\n\nonset\n\n32\n\nend\nc\n\n34\n\n=33.0K\n\n36\n\n38\n\nT (K)\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity \u03c1(T ) at \u03bc0 H = 0 for Tl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 (#1).\nThe inset enlarges the section at the superconducting transition, where Tconset \u2243 33.5K and Tcend \u2243 33K are determined\nfrom the onset and the end-point of the superconducting transition, respectively.\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n35\n\n36\n\n3.0\n\n(a) H c #1\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n(m\n\nSingle crystals of Tl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 were synthesized by using a Bridgeman method.11 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) identified the derived samples as a single\nphase with a tetragonal ThCr2 Si2 crystal structure. The\nactual composition of the crystals was determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDXS). Magnetic\nfield dependence of the electrical resistivity, \u03c1(H), was\nmeasured up to 57.5T using a typical 4-probe method in a\ncapacitor-bank-driven pulsed magnet. The experimental\ndata were recorded on a digitizer using a custom designed\nhigh-resolution, low-noise synchronous lock-in technique.\nIn order to minimize the eddy-current heating caused\nby the pulsed magnetic field, very small crystals were\ncleaved off along the ab-plane from the as-grown samples. The electrical resistivity in a DC magnetic field (014T) was measured in an Oxford Instruments HELIOX\nVL system using a Lakeshore AC Resistance Bridge and\nthe angular dependence of the electrical resistivity was\nperformed in a Quantum Design (QD) Physical Properties Measurement System (9T PPMS). Angular linear (\u03c1)\ntransport measurements were carried out using the maximum Lorentz force configuration (J\u22a5H), with H applied\nat an angle \u03b8 from the c axis of the crystal (see the inset\nof Fig. 5).\n\nRb\n\n0.58\n\n12\n\n(m\n\nEXPERIMENTAL METHODS\n\n(Tl\n\ncm)\n\nII.\n\n14\n\n1.0\n\nTHE UPPER CRITICAL FIELD AND ITS\nANISOTROPY\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nH(T)\n\n0\n\n0.0\n3.0\n\n(b) H//c #2\n\n2.5\n\ncm)\n\nIn Fig. 1, we show the temperature dependence of the\nelectrical resistivity at zero field for Tl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2\n(#1). One can see that the resistivity \u03c1(T ) shows a hump\naround 154K, changing from semiconducting to metallic behavior upon cooling down from room temperature.\nSuch a hump in \u03c1(T ) has been widely observed in the\niron selenides7\u201312,26 and its position can be tuned either\nby doping12 or pressure.26 The origin of the hump and its\nrelation with superconductivity remain unclear.

Furthermore, one\ncan see that the superconducting transition is significantly broadened upon applying a magnetic field, showing a tail structure at low temperature. For example,\nthe width of the superconducting transition, defined from\nthe onset temperature to the end point of the superconducting transition (see the inset of Fig.1), is as small as\n0.5K at zero field but increases to 2K and 3.6K for H\u22a5c\nand Hkc at 14T, respectively. Similar features were also\nobserved in some 1111-type iron pnictides.27\u201329 We will\nargue later that such behavior might be attributed to\nthe thermally activated flux flow in the vortex state. In\nthe normal state, Tl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 shows significant\npositive magnetoresistance for both Hkc and H\u22a5c. It is\nnoted that, in iron pnictides, the magnetoresistance becomes very large while entering the magnetic state, but\nis negligible in the non-magnetic state.5 One possibility\nfor the occurrence of such a large magnetoresistance in\nTl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 might be related to its magnetic\nordering at high temperature.14,15\nThe\nupper\ncritical\nfield\n\u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc )\nof\nTl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 is shown in Fig. 4, in which\n\n=0\n\nso\n\nso\n\n0\n\n32\n\n=0\n\n=5.6\n\n40\n\nH\n\n(m\n\ncm)\n\n2\n1\n\ncm)\n\nWHH\nWHH\n\n50\n\n35\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\n40\n\nH\n\nc onset\n\nH\n\nc mid\n\nH\n\nc end\n\n30\n8\n\nonset\nmid\n\n20\n\n6\n\nend\nDC\n\n4\n\n10\n0\n\n20\n\n0\n\nT (K)\n\n25\n\n5\n\n30\n\n2\n35\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) The upper critical field \u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc ) for\nTl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 . (a) The values of \u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc ) are determined from the superconducting onsets as described in Fig.\n1 and Fig. 3. Symbols of the open circle (\u25e6), filled circle (\u2022)\nand cross (+) represent the data obtained in a pulsed magnetic field and the triangles (\u25b3 and N) denote those measured\nin a DC magnetic field. Note that samples #3 and #4 were\nmeasured in a pulsed field, but only sample #3 was successfully measured for both H\u22a5c and Hkc. (b) The values of\n\u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc ) are determined from the onset (\u25e6), the min-point\n(\u0003) and the end-point (\u25b3) of the resistive superconducting\ntransitions (sample # 3), respectively. The inset shows the\ncorresponding temperature dependence of the anisotropic parameter \u03b3(T ).\n\nvarious symbols represent either different field orientations for the same sample (#3) or different samples\nas marked in the figure. In Fig. 4(a), we determine\nthe critical temperatures Tc2 (in the case of DC field)\nor the critical fields \u03bc0 Hc2 (in the case of pulsed field)\nfrom the superconducting onsets as described in the\ninset of Fig. 1 and also in Fig.3, i.e., the intersection\npoint of the resistive curves in the normal state and\nthe superconducting transition. Such a determination of \u03bc0 Hc2 (or Tc2 ) is appropriate for the in-field\nmeasurements and is particularly useful in presence of\nthe magnetoresistance \u03c1(\u03bc0 H). In this case, one can\nextrapolate \u03c1(\u03bc0 H) to lower temperatures to determine\n\u03bc0 Hc2 at the lowest temperatures since \u03c1(\u03bc0 H) in the\nnormal state hardly depend on temperature. It is noted\nthat similar field-induced broadening of the resistive\n\n\f4\nsuperconducting transition was also observed in the\nhigh Tc cuprates in which the onset temperature as we\ndescribed here was shown to be close to that determined\nby other bulk measurements, e.g., the magnetization.30\nFrom Fig. 4(a), one can see that the derived \u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc )\ndemonstrates quantitatively same behavior for all the\ninvestigated samples, independent of the detailed experHkc\nimental methods. The upper critical field \u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc )\nlinearly increases with decreasing temperature, reaching\nHkc\na value of \u03bc0 Hc2 (0K) \u2243 60T. On the other hand,\nH\u22a5c\n\u03bc0 Hc2\n(Tc ) shows a convex curvature with a much\nlarger value at low temperatures. Such behavior of\n\u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc ) is not changed by the field-induced broadening of the superconducting transition. Taking sample\n#3 as an example, in Fig. 4(b) we plot the upper critical\nfields \u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc ) determined at the onset, mid- and\nend-point of the resistive transitions (see Fig. 3), which\nfollow remarkably similar temperature dependence.\nWe note that our results are consistent with those of\nK0.8 Fe1.76 Se2 31 and K0.76 Fe1.61 Se0.96 S1.04 ;32 the former\nwas measured using a tunnel-diode resonator (TDR)\ntechnique in a pulsed magnetic field and the latter\nwas measured only up to 9T. It was also shown that\nthe values of \u03bc0 Hc2 determined from the end-point\nof the resistive transitions and the TDR technique\nare consistent,31 further confirming the validity of our\nmethods in the determination of upper critical fields.\nIn a superconductor, the Cooper pairs can be destroyed\nby the following two mechanisms in a magnetic field: (i)\nthe orbital pair breaking due to the Lorentz force acting\nvia the charge on the momenta of the paired electrons\n(orbital limit); (ii) the Zeeman effect aligning the spins\nof the two electrons with the applied field (Pauli paramagnetic limit). According to the WHH method, the\norb\norbital-limiting upper critical field \u03bc0 Hc2\n(0K) for a single band BCS superconductor is determined by the initial\nslope of \u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc ) at Tc , i.e.33\norb\n\u03bc0 Hc2\n(0K) = \u22120.69Tc (dHc2 /dT ) |T =Tc ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich value may depend on the field orientations. The\nPauli paramagnetic limiting field for weakly coupled BCS\nsuperconductors is given by34\np\n\u03bc0 Hc2\n(0K)[T] = 1.86Tc [K].\n\n(2)\n\nWhile the upper critical field is usually restricted by\nthe orbital limit in conventional superconductors, the\nspin paramagnetic effect may play an important role\nin pair breaking in some unconventional superconductors. Tl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 reveals a relatively large and\nanisotropic initial slope of \u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc ) near Tc , which\nreaches a value of -12T/K and -2T/K (from the superconducting onsets) for H\u22a5c and Hkc, respectively.\nFollowing Eq. 1, one can derive the orbitally limited\norb\nupper critical field, which gives \u03bc0 Hc2\n(0K) = 273T\nfor H\u22a5c and 45T for Hkc. As shown in Fig. 4,\norb\n\u03bc0 Hc2\n(0K) considerably exceeds the experimental value\nof \u03bc0 Hc2 (0K) for H\u22a5c, but lightly falls below the corresponding \u03bc0 Hc2 (0K) for Hkc. On the other hand, Eq. 2\n\np\ngives a Pauli paramagnetic limiting field of \u03bc0 Hc2\n(0K) \u2248\n60T in terms of the BCS theory. Thus, it is likely that the\nupper critical field is limited by orbital effect for Hkc, but\nby spin paramagnetic effect for H\u22a5c. In order to further\nlook into this point, we fitted the experimental data of\n\u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc ) by the WHH model,33 in which the effects of\nboth orbital- and spin-pair breaking are considered (see\nFig. 4a). In this model, \u03b1 and \u03bbso are the fitting parameters; \u03b1 is the Maki parameter, which represents the relative strength of spin and orbital pair-breaking, and \u03bbso is\nthe spin-orbit scattering constant. As shown in Fig.4(a),\nthe upper critical field \u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc ) for both Hkc and H\u22a5c\nare not well described by the WHH method while ignoring the spin effect (see the dot dashed lines with \u03b1=0\nHkc\nand \u03bbso =0). The enhancement of \u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc ) at low\ntemperature is likely attributed to its multi-band electronic structure as discussed in other FeSCs.25 Indeed,\nH\u22a5c\n\u03bc0 Hc2\n(Tc ) can be well fitted by the WHH model after\nconsidering the spin effect (see the solid line in Fig.4a),\nwhich gives \u03b1=5.6 and \u03bbso =0.3. Such a large value of \u03b1\nindicates that the spin paramagnetism may play an important role on suppressing superconductivity for H\u22a5c.\nSimilar analysis applies to the data of \u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc ) derived\nat various resistive drops of the broad superconducting\ntransition, showing generally consistent behavior. In the\ncase of a cylinder-like Fermi surface, the open electron orbits along the c-axis make the orbital limiting upper critical field unlikely. Existence of a Pauli limiting \u03bc0 Hc2 (0)\nfor H \u22a5 c seems to agree with the enhanced anisotropy in\nTl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 (see below). On the other hand, its\nmulti-band electronic structure may complicate the analysis of \u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc ). Nevertheless, the upper critical field\nof Tl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 shows similar behavior to that\nof other iron pnictide superconductors,20\u201325 indicating a\nuniform scenario of \u03bc0 Hc2 (0) in the FeSCs.\n\nThe\nanisotropic\nparameter\n\u03b3(T )\nof\nTl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 (sample #3), derived at variant points of the superconducting transition, is shown\nin the inset of Fig.4(b). One can see that all these\ncurves follow exactly same temperature dependence but\nwith a small deviation on their absolute values of \u03b3(T ).\nFor example, the anisotropic parameter \u03b3, determined\nfrom the superconducting onsets, is as high as 8 near\nTc but reaches 2 at T = 20 K. Similar values of \u03b3(T )\nwere also obtained for other samples as a result of their\nconsistent behavior of the upper critical field (see Fig.\n4a). The anisotropy of the upper critical field near Tc\ncan be associated with its electronic band structure.\nObservation of \u03b3 \u223c 8 near Tc might suggest a quasi-2D\nelectronic structure for Tl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 , which\nis compatible with the large resistive anisotropy in\nthe normal state (\u03c1c /\u03c1ab \u223c 30)11 . An anisotropy of\n\u03b3\u223c8 near Tc in Tl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 is relatively large\namong the FeSCs,20\u201325 but it is close to that of the\n1111-compounds.24 Nevertheless, in all these systems\nthe superconducting properties tend to be more isotropic\nat low temperatures, which would be compatible with\nthe isotropic-like superconducting energy gaps observed\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) The angular dependence of the superconducting critical temperature Tc (\u03b8) at magnetic fields\nof \u03bc0 H=3T, 6T and 9T. The solid lines show the fittings to\nEq. 4. Here Tc (\u03b8) is determined from the superconducting\nonsets.\n\nin the ARPES experiments around 15K.16\u201319\nIn order to further characterize the nature of the\nanisotropy in Tl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 , we have measured\nthe angular dependence of the electrical resistivity \u03c1(T )\nat various magnetic fields. Fig. 5 plots the angular dependence of Tc (\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle between the magnetic field and the c-axis of the sample as marked in the\nfigure.\nAccording to the single band anisotropic GinzburgLandau (G-L) theory,35,36 the angular dependence of the\nupper critical field can be scaled by:\np\nGL\n\u03bc0 Hc2\n(\u03b8) = \u03bc0 Hc2 / cos2 (\u03b8) + \u03b3 \u22122 sin2 (\u03b8), (3)\nHkc\n\nH\u22a5c\nwhere \u03b3=(mab /mc )1/2 =Hc2\n/Hc2 . Here mab and mc\nare the effective masses of electrons for the in-plane and\nout-of-plane motion, respectively. In the case that Hc2 is\na linear function of temperature, the angular dependence\nof \u03bc0 Hc2 (\u03b8) can be converted to that of Tc by:37\n\np\nHkc\nTc (\u03b8) = Tc0 + H/(\u2202Hc2 /\u2202T ) cos2 (\u03b8) + \u03b3 \u22122 sin2 (\u03b8),\n(4)\nwhere Tc0 is the zero field superconducting transition\ntemperature and H is the applied magnetic field. In our\ncase, the upper critical field near Tc indeed shows nearly\nlinear temperature dependence for both H\u22a5c and Hkc.\nTherefore, one can estimate the anisotropic parameter \u03b3\nfrom the angular dependence of Tc (\u03b8). It was shown that\na single band anisotropic model can properly describe\nthe angular dependence of \u03bc0 Hc2 in a multi-band system\nat temperatures near Tc .21,38 Indeed, Tc (\u03b8) can be nicely\nfitted by Eq. 4 (see the solid lines in Fig.5), indicating\nthat, at least in the low field region, Tc (\u03b8) can be described by the G-L theory and the anisotropic upper critical field is attributed to the effective mass anisotropy in\n\nstrongly coupled layered superconductors. Furthermore,\nthe above fittings give \u03b3=8.5, 7.3 and 6.3 for \u03bc0 H=3T,\n6T and 9T, respectively. These values of \u03b3(\u03bc0 H) are very\nclose to those shown in the inset of Fig. 4 if we convert\nthe magnetic fields to temperatures following the relation\nof \u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc ).\nIn comparison, the iron selenides show intrinsically\nsimilar properties of the upper critical field to the iron\npnictide superconductors,20\u201325 but with a slightly enhanced anisotropy. These findings suggest that all these\nFeSCs might share the same characters of superconductivity. This is surprising because the electronic structure\nand the normal state of iron selenides seem to be very\nunique among the FeSCs. For example, both hole pockets\nand electron pockets are observed in iron pnictides,19 but\nthe hole pocket seems to be absent in iron selenides.16\u201318\nThe nesting between the hole pockets and the electron\npockets was regarded as a prerequisite factor for the forming of s\u00b1 paring state,39 a widely accepted proposal for\nthe iron pnictide superconductors. Our findings of the\nuniversal behavior of \u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc ) in iron pnictides and selenides, therefore, urge to check whether the missing of\nhole pockets in iron selenides is intrinsic or masked by\nother experimental factors, e.g., the phase separation or\nsample non-stiochiometry. If it is intrinsic, one probably\nneeds to reconsider the order parameters and the pairing\nmechanism of FeSCs in a unified picture.\n\nIV.\n\nTHERMALLY ACTIVATED FLUX FLOW\n\nAs already mentioned above, the superconducting\ntransition of Tl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 is significantly broadened upon applying a magnetic field (see Fig. 2 and Fig.\n3). Similar features were previously observed in other\nlayered superconductors, including the cuprates40,41 and\nthe 1111-type iron pnictides,27\u201329 which were interpreted in terms of the energy dissipation caused by\nvortices motion. In general, both thermally activated\nflux flow (TAFF) and superconducting critical fluctuations may broaden the resistive superconducting transition in a magnetic field. The importance of thermal\nfluctuations is measured by Ginzburg number, Gi =\n1\n2 3 2\n2 (\u03b3Tc /Hc \u03beab ) , where Hc is the thermal dynamic critical\nfield and \u03beab is the coherence length in the ab-plane. In\nTl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 , the relatively large anisotropic parameter \u03b3 near Tc and the short coherence length (\u03be \u2243 2.1\nnm) yield a large Ginzburg number Gi and a soft vortex matter. As a result, thermal fluctuations may become important enough to overcome the elastic energy\nof the vortex lattice in a large part of the magnetic field\n-temperature phase diagram, melting the vortex lattice\ninto a liquid. On the other hand, the critical fluctuations\nmay play a less dominant role here. Therefore, in the\nfollowing we will try to interpret the resistive broadening\nin terms of the thermally activated flux flows which actually gives a rather good description to our experimental\ndata. Further measurements are also under way in order\n\n\f6\n0.028\n\n0.030\n\n0.032\n\n0.034\n(a)\n\n1\n\ncm)]\n\n0\n\n(m\n\n2T\n\n-1\n\nH\n\n6T\n8T\n10T\n12T\n\n5\n\nU ~H\n0\n\n3\n\n(x10 K)\n\n4\n3\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n14T\n\n-0.27(2)\n\nU\n\nln [\n\n4T\n\nc #1\n\n2\n1\n0\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\nH (T)\n\n-3\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n1\n\n2T\n\ncm)]\n\n0\n\nH//c #2\n\n4T\n6T\n\n-1\n\n8T\n10T\n12T\n\n-2\nU ~H\n\n14T\n\n-0.22(2)\n\n3\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n(x10 K)\n\n3\n\nU\n\nln [\n\n(m\n\n4\n\n-4\n\n1\n0\n\n-5\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\nH (T)\n\n0\n\n0.025\n\n0.030\n\n0.035\n\n0.040\n\n0.045\n\n0.050\n\n-1\n\n1/T (K )\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Arrhenius plot of Tl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2\nat various magnetic fields: (a) H\u22a5c; (b) Hkc. The inset\nshows the thermally activated energy, U0 (H), obtained from\nthe slope of the Arrehnius plot. The solid lines are fitted to\nU0 (H) \u2248 H \u2212n with n=0.27\u00b10.02 and 0.22\u00b10.02 for H\u22a5c and\nHkc, respectively.\n\nto elucidate the possible effect of superconducting fluctuations.\nAccording to the TAFF model,43 the resistivity\n\u03c1(T, H) can be expressed as:\n\u03c1(T, H) = (2\u03bd0 LH/J)sinh[JHV L/T ]e\u2212Jc0HV L/T , (5)\nwhere \u03bd0 is an attempt frequency for a flux bundle hopping, L is the hopping distance, J is the applied current\ndensity, Jc0 is the critical current density in the absence\nof flux creep and V is the bundle volume. In the limit of\nJHV L/T \u226a 1, Eq. 5 can be simplified as\n\u03c1(T, H) = (2\u03c1c U/T )e\u2212U/T ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere U = Jc0 HV L is the thermally activated energy\nand \u03c1c =\u03bd0 LH/Jc0 . Assuming that 2\u03c1c U/T is a temperature independent constant, noted as \u03c10f , and U =\nU0 (1 \u2212 T /Tc ), then Eq. 6 can be simplified to the Arrhenius relation:\nln\u03c1(T, H) = ln\u03c10f \u2212 U0 (H)/T.\n\n(7)\n\nThus, the apparent activation energy, U0 (H), could be\nextracted from the slopes of the Arrhenius plots, i.e., the\nplot of ln\u03c1 v.s. 1/T .\nIn order to study such a possible vortex motion in\nTl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 , we plot the electrical resistivity \u03c1\n\nas a function of 1/T in a semi-log scale at various magnetic fields (see Fig. 6). It is clear that the Arrhenius\nrelation holds over a wide temperature range for both\nH\u22a5c and Hkc, suggesting that the TAFF model may\nnicely describe the field-induced resistive broadening in\nTl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 . Following U0 (H)=-dln\u03c1/d(1/T ),\nthe apparent activation energy, U0 (H), can then be determined from the slope of the linear parts in Fig. 6. For\nexample, this yields U0 \u22484900K for H\u22a5c and 3607K for\nHkc at 2T. The derived values of U0 (H) are plotted as a\nfunction of field in the insets of Fig. 6: (a) H\u22a5c and (b)\nHkc, which follow a power law of U0 (H)\u223cH \u2212n . The fittings give n=0.27\u00b10.02 for H\u22a5c and 0.22\u00b10.02 for Hkc,\nindicating that the pinning force may have a weak orientation dependence. The derived values of U0 (H) are\nslightly larger than those of some 1111-type iron pnictides, e.g. NdFeAsO0.7 F0.3 27 and CeFeAsO0.9 F0.1 ,28 but\nsmaller than those of SmFeAsO0.85 29 and YBCO41 , indicating a moderate pinning force among the cuprates\nand the FeSCs. Note that in the 122-type iron pnictides\nwhere \u03b3\u22432 near Tc , the range of vortex liquid state is\nvery narrow and no significant broadening of the resistive superconducting transition has been observed in a\nmagnetic field .20,42\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe upper critical field \u03bc0 Hc2 (Tc ), its anisotropy\n\u03b3(T ) and the vortex motion of the newly discovered\nTl0.58 Rb0.42 Fe1.72 Se2 have been studied by measuring\nthe field-, temperature- and angular- dependence of the\nelectrical resistivity. We found that this compound\nHkc\nshows a large upper critical field (\u03bc0 Hc2 (0K) \u2243 60T,\nH\u22a5c\n\u03bc0 Hc2\n(18K) \u2243 60T) with a moderate anisotropy near\nTc . The anisotropic parameter decreases with decreasing\ntemperature, reaching \u03b3(20K)\u223c2. Analysis based on the\nWHH model indicates that the upper critical field is orbitally limited for Hkc, but is likely limited by the spin\nparamagnetic effect for H\u22a5c. These properties remarkably resemble those of iron pnictide superconductors,\nsuggesting that all the Fe-based superconductors may\nbear similar characters and, therefore, provide restrictions on the theoretical model. Similar to the cuprates\nand the 1111-series of iron pnictides, thermally activated\nflux flow might be responsible for the tail structure of\nthe resistive transition below Tc and the derived thermal activation energies are compatible with those of the\n1111-type iron pnictides.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWork at ZJU was supported by the National Science\nFoundation of China (grant Nos: 10874146, 10934005),\nthe National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (2009CB929104, 2011CBA00103), the PCSIRT of\nthe Ministry of Education of China, Zhejiang Provin-\n\n\f7\ncial Natural Science Foundation of China, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.\nWork at LANL was performed under the auspices of the\nNational Science Foundation, the Department of Energy,\nand the State of Florida.
