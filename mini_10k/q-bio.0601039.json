There are\n1 mdudek@proton.if.uz.zgora.pl\n2 stauffer@thp.Uni-Koeln.DE\n\n1\n\n\ffour possible nucleotides, A, T, G, C, in a DNA sequence. In our model, the\nDNA sequence is represented, simply, by four reals, FA , FT , FG , FC , being the\nnucleotide fractions and\nFA + FT + FG + FC = 1.\n\n(1)\n\nThe nucleotide fractions depend on time due to mutations and selection.\nOur model is originating from the Bak-Sneppen model of co-evolution [1]\nand Kimura's neutral mutation hypothesis ([2],[3]). According to Kimura's hypothesis, neutral mutations are responsible for molecular diversity of species.\nIn 1980, Kimura introduced two-parameter model [4], [5], where the transitional substitution rate (substitutions A \u2194 G and C \u2194 T ) is different from the\ntransversional rate (substitutions A \u2194 T , G \u2194 T , A \u2194 C, G \u2194 C) .

Here, the initial fractions take the following values: FA = 0.320964,\nFT = 0.246541, FG = 0.0252434, FC = 0.407252. Besides, there has been\nplotted the maximum absolute deviation from the difference |FA \u2212 FT | and\n|FG \u2212 FC | (the dashed curve).\nsimplest models of nucleotide substitutions. For example, in reconstructing the\nphylogenetic trees, one should use a more general form of the transition matrix\nin Eq.(3) ([5],[6],[8],[7]). This is not necessary in our model, where we need only\nthe property that the nucleotide frequencies are evolving to their equilibrium\nvalues.\nMore complicated prey-predator relations were simulated with a 5\u00d75 Chowdhury lattice [11] with a fixed number of six food levels. Each lower (prey) level\ncontains twice as many possible species as the upper (predator) level. Also this\nmodel does not contain an explicit bit-string as genome. We now introduced a\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\ncomposition vector F (t) as above, different for each different species, and let it\nevolve according to Eq.(3). Again, after many iterations all four fractions approached 0.25. This result, as we will show below, is qualitatively different from\nthat in the model defined below, where we observe fluctuations of nucleotide\nfrequency, instead.\nOur model consists of N species and for each species we define the set of\nrandom parameters, FA , FT , FG , FC , u, s, v, which satisfy only two equations,\nEq.(1) and Eq.(5), and we assume that 4s > 8v to fulfill the condition that\ntransitions (s) dominate transversions (v). The nucleotide fractions, representing each species, change in time according to Eq.(3).\nThe species are related according to food-chain. In the case of the nearestneighbor relation the species i + 1 preys on species i. The extension to further\n\n3\n\n\fneighbors follows the same manner. The food-chain has the same dynamics as\nin Bak-Sneppen model (BS) [1], i.e., every discrete time step t, we choose the\nspecies i with minimum fitness Bi and the chosen species is replaced by a new\none together with the species linked to it with respect to food-chain relation.\nIn the original BS model the nearest neighborhood of species i is symmetrical,\ne.g. {Bi\u22121 , Bi , Bi+1 }. The asymmetrical (directional) neighborhood applied\nfor food-chain modeling has been discussed by Stauffer and Jan [9] and their\nresults were qualitatively the same as in the BS model. The generalizations of\nfood-chain onto more complex food-web structures are also available [10], [11].\nThe new species, substituting the old ones, obtain new random values FA ,\nFT , FG , FC , u, s, v. In our model the fitness Bi of the species i = 1, 2, . . . , N\nis represented by the parameter\nBi = 1 \u2212 D,\n\nD = max(|FA \u2212 FT |, |FG \u2212 FC |),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Bi \u2208 [0, 1] is a measure of the deviation from equilibrium of the nucleotide\nnumbers FA \u2212 FT and FG \u2212 FC . Thus, the species with the smallest value of\nBi (largest compositional deviation from equilibrium) are eliminated together\nwith their right-hand neighbors with respect to food-chain. This elimination\nmechanism leads to self-organization. Namely, in the case of finite value of N\nthe statistically stationary distribution of the values of Bi (i = 1, 2, . . . , N ) is\nachieved after finite number of time steps with the property that the selected\nspecies with the minimum value Bmin is always below some threshold value\nBc or it is equal to the value. The typical snapshot, at transient time, of the\ndistribution of the values of Bi is presented in Fig.2.\nSo, if Fig.2 looks much the same as it had been resulted from the simulation\nof pure BS model, then what are the new results in our model? In the following,\nwe will show that the higher value of the threshold fitness, during the evolution\ncourse, it is often the case that the winners of the food-chain competition become\nalso species with specific nucleotide composition, which is generating long genes.\n\n2\n\nDiscussion of results\n\nWe know, from Eq.(3) (see also Fig.1), that a single species tends to posses\nequilibrium nucleotide composition, which in this simple two-parameter Kimura\nmodel means asymptotically the same nucleotide composition FA = FT = FG =\nFC = 0.25. The only distinction, which we could observe, if we had used a\nmore general form of the substitution table, could be the resulting equilibrium\nnucleotide composition different from the uniform one. This would bring nothing\nnew to the qualitative behavior of our model.\nOnce, in the model under consideration, nucleotide composition of species is\nchanging according to Eq.(3), the species fitness Bi depends on time. It is not\nthe case in the BS model [1], where the fitness of the evolving species is constant\nin time unless it is extincted. Although Bi depends on time, the food-chain\nselection rule introduces mechanism, which forbids to achieve the equilibrium\nnucleotide composition (Bi = 1).

In our model the threshold value\ndepends on substitution rate u. The examples of this dependence for transient\ntime of 109 generations have been plotted in Fig.3.\nSimilarly, as in BS model, the SOC phenomenon disappears if the number\nof nearest neighbors n = 0. Then, all species tend to the state with B = 1.\nWe will discuss the influence of threshold fitness optimization on nucleotide\ncomposition of species and, in consequence, its influence on the possible maximum length of gene in species genome. To this aim, we assume that a gene\nhas continuous structure (no introns) and it always starts from codon START\n(ATG) and ends with codon STOP (TGA, TAG or TAA). Then, the probability\nof generating any gene consisting of k nucleotide triplets in a random genome\nwith the fractions FA , FT , FG , FC could be approximated by the following\nformulae (see also [13]):\nP (k) = \u03b1FA FT FG (2FA FT FG + FA2 FT )(1 \u2212 2FA FT FG \u2212 FA2 FT )k\u22121 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a normalization constant, which can be derived from the normalization condition\nkX\ncutoff\n\nP (k) = 1.\n\nk=1\n\n6\n\n(8)\n\n\fThe value of kcutoff in Eq.(8) could be associated with genome size.\nIn Fig.4, there has been shown the relation between the empirical distribution of gene length k in chromosome IV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome\nand the distribution P (k) in Eq.(7). Similar results we could obtain for other\ngenomes. One can observe, that the approximation in Eq.(7) is acceptable for\nsmall gene size, whereas it becomes wrong for large gene size. Generally, it is\naccepted that there is direct selective pressure on gene size for the effect. Examples of papers discussing the problem could be found [12],[13],[14] together\nwith analyses of rich experimental data.\nThe lowest frequency of gene size, k, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome is\nequal to P0 \u2248 2.8 \u00d7 10\u22125 (Fig.4). In many natural genomes P0 takes value of\nthe same order of magnitude, e.g., in the B.burgdorferi genome P0 \u2248 5.7 \u00d7 10\u22125.\nIn our model, we have assumed that for all species holds P0 = 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 . We\nhave also introduced maximum gene length, kmax , which is the largest value of\nk for which P (k) \u2265 P0 .\nIn the particular case of the same fractions of nucleotides in genome (FA =\nFT = FG = FC = 0.25) the limiting value k = kmax for which P (k) \u2265 P0 is\nequal to kmax = 225 nucleotide triplets (675 nucleotides). Thus, in our model,\nwe could expect that for the oldest species the maximum gene length kmax\nshould not exceed the value of 675 nucleotides. The reason for that is that ageing\nspecies should approach equilibrium composition (Fig.1). However, surprisingly,\nwe found that the self-organization phenomenon enforces a state, in which the\noldest species may have much longer gene sizes than in genome with nucleotide\ncomposition corresponding to equilibrium composition. Actually, there start to\nappear fluctuations in the number of species with very short genes and very\nlong ones.\nThe selection towards the species with the smallest deviation from equilibrium nucleotide composition (the largest value of B) implicates that the species,\nwhich survive the selection, may have specific bias in nucleotide composition,\nwhich makes possible generating long genes. In our model, we have observed\nabundances of G+C content in the species with long genes. During simulation\nrun, in each time step t, we have collected in a file data representing age of the\noldest species, the corresponding gene size k and nucleotide frequency. We have\nobserved, that the closer the species fitness Bi is to the threshold fitness the\nolder might be the species and also the species might posses longer genes in its\ngenome. There is no such effect in the case, when n = 0. Even if there could\nappear, at some early time interval, a tendency to generate longer genes, this\nproperty would have disappeared after longer evolution time of the system of N\nspecies. In Fig.5, we have plotted time dependence of the recorded maximum\nlength of gene in the oldest species and the corresponding Guanine fraction. One\ncan compare this figure with Fig.6, where there are no prey-predator relation\nin the ecosystem (n = 0). In the latter case, the system is ageing in accordance\nwith the Eq.(3) and Bi \u2192 1 (i = 1, 2, . . . , N ) and self-organization has not been\nobserved.\nThe observed property of the competing species has an analogy with the\nbehavior of the model of evolution of evolving legal rules in Anglo-American\n7\n\n\f2000\n\nu=0.1*rnd\n\nkmax\n\n1500\n1000\n500\n\nfraction of Guanine\n\n0\n0,5\n0,4\n\nu=0.1*rnd\n\n0,3\n0,2\n0,1\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n10\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\ntime\n\nFigure 5: Time dependence of maximum gene size, kmax , of the oldest species\nand the Guanine content in their genome in the evolving ecosystem when N =\n500, u = 0.1 \u2217 rnd, n = 1.

The same parameters as in\nFig.5 have been used.\ncourt, introduced by Yee [15] (see Fig. 3 in his paper).\nThe relation between nucleotide fraction of genome and the possible maximum length of gene in such genome has been shown in the histogram in Fig.7.\nThe presented data address, solely, the oldest species. Notice, A \u2248 T and\nG \u2248 C for genomes both with short genes and long ones, whereas A \u2248 T \u2248 G \u2248\nC \u2248 0.25 for genomes with nucleotide composition near equilibrium understood\nin terms of the two-parameter Kimura model. We should remember, that the\nsubstitution table for the two-parameter Kimura model (Eq.3) is a symmetric matrix and the observed compositional asymmetry results directly from the\npredator-prey self-organization phenomenon. The right-hand wings, evident in\nthe structure in Fig.7, do vanish in the case when n = 0 in spite of the same\nfitness parameter in Eq.6 applied for selection.\nWe have not included strand structure in species genome, in our model,\nsince it is represented only with the help of nucleotide fraction. Lobry and\nSueoka, in their paper [16], concluded that if there are no bias in mutation and\nselection between two DNA strands, then it is expected A \u2248 T and G \u2248 C\nwithin each strand, and that the observed variation in G+C content between\nspecies is an effect of another phenomenon than, simply, asymmetric mutation\npressure. Here, we have shown, that such compositional fluctuations of genome\ncould result from ecosystem optimization - no direct selection on genes length\nis present in our model.\nThe predator-prey rule, in the model under consideration, introduces large\n\n9\n\n\ffluctuations in nucleotide frequency in the ageing ecosystem, if it is sufficiently\nold. However, we have not observed this frequency phenomenon in modeling\nspeciation on the Chowdhury lattice [11], as we stated in the beginning. After we have introduced a small change of our model, in such a way, that new\nspecies arising in the speciation process were taken always from among the survived species, and we only slightly were modifying their nucleotide frequency by\nintroducing d% of changes in their values, then the observed by us fluctuations\nceased to exist in the limit d \u2192 0, as found in the Chowdhury model.\n\n3\n\nConclusions\n\nThe specific result of the food-chain self-organization of the competing species is\nthat the oldest survivors of the competition might posses strong compositional\nbias in nucleotides, the abundance of G+C content. In our model, this resulting\nasymmetry makes possible generating long genes. There was no direct selection\napplied on the gene length, in the model. The fluctuation in number of species\nwith long genes and short genes represents rather undirectional noise, the amplitude of which is increasing while the ecosystem is ageing. The effect ceases to\nexist if there is no species competition. The same is if we allow only d% changes\nof nucleotide frequency in the new formed species, in the limit d \u2192 0.\nIt could be, that the observed self-organization is an attribute of genes in\ngenome evolution. Typically, many genes are coupled together in genome in a\nhierarchical dynamical structure, which resembles complex food-web structure.\nSome genes may be duplicated but also you can observe fusion of genes or even\ngenomes.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank geneticist S.
