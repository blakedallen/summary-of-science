Through traditional mass-modelling, the observed curve is routinely\nused to infer the mass distribution of galaxies and hence their dark matter\ncontents (e.g. Begeman 1987; Kent 1987; Geehan et al. 2006). In contrast, the\nthickness of the gas layer depends on the vertical gravitational force and thus\ntraces the potential perpendicular to the plane e.g.,(Narayan & Jog 2002a).\nRecently, the rotation curve and the outer galactic H i flaring data have been\nused together to probe the dark matter halos of a few galaxies. The rotation\ncurve mainly determines the mass enclosed within a given radius, and therefore\nthe power-law index of the density profile of the halo. The flaring curve, on\nthe other hand, determines its shape uniquely. So, both the constraints have\nto be used on an equal footing to correctly determine the parameters of the\ndark matter halo of any galaxy.\nThe H i scale height data coupled with the rotation curve has been used to\nstudy the dark matter halos of NGC 4244 (Olling 1996) , NGC 891 (Becquaert\n& Combes 1997) and the Galaxy (Olling & Merrifield 2000, 2001) in the past.\nNarayan et al. (2005) studied the Galactic dark matter halo by rigorously\nincorporating the self-gravity of the gas into their model for the Galaxy unlike\nsome of the previous studies given in the literature. They concluded that a\nsteeper-than-isothermal, spherical halo best fits the observations, the scale\nheight data at that time being available up to galactocentric distances of 24\nkpc. These results were confirmed by Kalberla et al. (2007), who, however,\nincluded a dark matter ring in their model to explain their extended H i scale\nheight data available till 40 kpc. In our previous work (Banerjee & Jog 2008),\nwe studied the dark matter halo of M31, where we developed a model similar\nto the Galaxy (Narayan et al. 2005) . However, in addition, we included the\nbulge into the model, and also varied the shape of the halo as a free parameter,\nunlike the Galaxy case. Further, we fitted the rotation curve over the entire\nradial range instead of pinning it at a single point like the Galaxy case. We\nscanned the four dimensional grid of the four free parameters characterizing\nthe halo, in a systematic manner, and found that an isothermal halo of an\noblate shape of axis ratio q = 0.4 gives the best fit to the available data.\nIn this paper, we apply for the first time a similar approach to study the dark\nmatter halo properties of a low surface brightness (LSB) \"superthin\" galaxy:\nUGC 7321. UGC 7321 is a bulgeless, pure disc galaxy of Hubble Type Sd, and\nhas a highly flattened stellar disc with a planar-to-vertical axis ratio of 10.3.\nA few of its key properties are summarized in Table 1. The galaxy has an\nextended H i disc, and the scale height data are available up to 6-7 disc scale\n2\n\n\fTable 1\nUGC\n7321 Paramaters\na\nParameters\n\nValue\n\nAopt (kpc)\n\n16.3\n\nLB (L\u2299 )\n\n1.0 \u00d7 109\n\nc\n\nMH i (M\u2299 )\n\n1.1 \u00d7 109\n\nd\n\nhR (kpc)\n\n2.1\n\ne\n\nz0 (pc)\n\n150\n\nf\n\n\u03bcB,i (0)(mag arcsec\u22122 )\n\n23.5\n\nvrot (kms\u22121 )\n\n105\n\nStar f ormation rate (M\u2299 per year for massive stars \u2265 5M\u2299\n\n\u223c 0.02\n\nb\n\ng\n\na\n\nAll quantities are taken from Matthews et al.

So it is highly suitable for the application\nof the above method to probe its dark matter halo properties.\nBased on traditional mass-modelling which only uses the observed rotation\ncurve as the constraint, it has been found that the late-type, low surface\nbrightness galaxies are generally dark matter dominated, often within the\ninner portions of their stellar discs (de Blok & McGaugh 1997) . In the case\nof UGC 7321, other lines of evidence have already suggested that it, too, is\na highly dark matter-dominated galaxy. It has large ratios of its dynamical\nmass to its H i mass and blue luminosity, (Mdyn /MHI = 31 and Mdyn /LB = 29,\nrespectively; (cf. Roberts & Haynes 1994) , and an extraordinarily small stellar\ndisc scale height (\u223c150 pc for a distance of 10 Mpc based on an exponential\nfit; Matthews 2000). These properties suggest the need for a massive dark halo\nto stabilize the disc against vertical bending instabilities (Zasov et al. 1991) .\nUGC 7321 is devoid of a central bulge component (Matthews et al. 1999) and\nits molecular gas content appears to be dynamically insignificant (Matthews\n& Gao 2001; Matthews & Wood 2001). We, therefore, model the galaxy as a\ngravitationally coupled, two-component system of stars and atomic hydrogen\ngas with the dark matter halo acting as a source of external force to this\n3\n\n\fsystem. We use a four-parameter density profile for the dark matter halo (de\nZeeuw & Pfenniger 1988; Bequaert & Combes 1997): the core density, the core\nradius, the power-law density index and the axis ratio of the halo being the four\nfree parameters characterizing it. We methodically vary the four parameters\nwithin their respective feasible ranges, and try to obtain an optimum fit to\nboth the observed rotation curve and the vertical scale height data at the same\ntime. As we shall see, this method predicts a spherical, isothermal halo with\na core density of about 0.039- 0.057 M\u2299 pc\u22123 and core radius of 2.5 - 2.9 kpc\nfor this galaxy.\nThe layout of the present paper is as follows. We briefly discuss the model in\n\u00a72, and in \u00a73 the method of solving the equations and the input parameters\nused is discussed. In \u00a74, we present the results, followed by the discussion and\nconclusions in \u00a7\u00a75 and 6, respectively.\n\n2\n\nDescription of the model used\n\n2.1 Gravitationally coupled, two-component, galactic disc model\n\nThe galaxy is modelled as a gravitationally-coupled, two-component system of\nstars and atomic hydrogen gas embedded in the dark matter halo, which exerts an external force on the system while remaining rigid and non-responsive\nitself. This is a simplified version of the Galaxy case (Narayan & Jog 2002b) ,\nwhere a gravitationally-coupled, three-component system of stars, atomic and\nmolecular hydrogen was considered. Here, the two components, present in the\nform of discs, are assumed to be axisymmetric and coplanar with each other\nfor the sake of simplicity. Also, it is assumed that the components are in a\nhydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction. Therefore, the density distribution of each component will be jointly determined by the Poisson equation,\nand the corresponding equation for pressure equilibrium perpendicular to the\nmidplane.\nIn terms of the galactic cylindrical co-ordinates (R, \u03c6, z), the Poisson equation\nfor an azimuthally symmetric system is given by\n2\nX\n\u2202 2 \u03a6total\n1 \u2202\n\u2202\u03a6total\n+\n(R\n) = 4\u03c0G( \u03c1i + \u03c1h )\n\u2202z 2\nR \u2202R\n\u2202R\ni=1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c1i with i = 1 to 2 denotes the mass density for each disc component\nwhile \u03c1h denotes the mass density of the halo. \u03a6total denotes the total potential due to the disc and the halo. For a nearly constant rotation curve\nas is the case here, the radial term can be neglected as its contribution to\n4\n\n\fthe determination of the H i scale height is less than ten percent as was noted\nby earlier calculations Narayan et al. (2005). So, the above equation reduces to\n2\nX\n\u2202 2 \u03a6total\n\u03c1i + \u03c1h )\n=\n4\u03c0G(\n\u2202z 2\ni=1\n\n(2)\n\nThe equation for hydrostatic equilibrium in the z direction is given by Rohlfs\n(1977)\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03a6total\n(\u03c1i h(vz2 )i i) + \u03c1i\n=0\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\n(3)\n\nwhere h(vz2 )i i is the mean square random velocity along the z direction for the\nith component. Further we assume that each component is isothermal i.e., the\nrandom velocity vz remains constant with z.\nCombining eq. (2) and eq. (3), we get\nh(vz2 )i i\n\n2\nX\n\u2202 1 \u2202\u03c1i\n[\n] = \u22124\u03c0G( \u03c1i + \u03c1h )\n\u2202z \u03c1i \u2202z\ni=1\n\n(4)\n\nThis represents a set of two coupled, second-order, ordinary differential equations which needs to be solved to obtain the vertical density distribution of\neach of the two components. Although the net gravitational potential acting on each component is the same, the response will be different due to the\ndifferent velocity dispersions of the two components.\n\n2.2\n\nDark Matter Halo\n\nWe use the four-parameter dark matter halo model (de Zeeuw & Pfenniger\n1988; Bequaert & Combes 1997) with the density profile given by\n\n\u03c1(R, z) =\n\n\u03c10\n2\n[1 + Rmc 2 ]p\n\n(5)\n\nwhere m2 =R2 + (z 2 /q 2 ), \u03c10 is the central core density of the halo, Rc is the\ncore radius, p is the power-law density index, and q is the vertical-to-planar\naxis ratio of the halo (spherical: q = 1; oblate: q < 1; prolate: q > 1).\n5\n\n\f3\n\nNumerical Solution of the Equations & Input Parameters\n\n3.1 Solution of equations\nFor a given halo density profile, eq. (4) is solved in an iterative fashion, as an\ninitial value problem, using the fourth-order, Runge-Kutta method of integration, with the following two initial conditions at the mid-plane (i.e., z = 0)\nfor each component:\nd\u03c1i\n\u03c1i = (\u03c10 )i ,\n=0\n(6)\ndz\nAs the modified mid-plane density (\u03c10 )i for each component is not known\na priori, the net surface density \u03a3i (R), given by twice the area under the\ncurve of \u03c1i (z) versus z, is used as the secondary boundary condition, as this\nquantity is known from observations (see \u00a73.2). The required value of (\u03c1i )0\nis thus determined by a trial and error method, which gives the required\n\u03c1i (z) distribution after four iterations with an accuracy to the second decimal\nplace. Existing theoretical models suggest a sech2 profile for an isothermal\ndensity distribution. But for a three-component disc, the vertical distribution\nis shown to be steeper than a sech2 function close to the mid-plane (Banerjee\n& Jog 2007).However, at large z values, it is close to a sech2 distribution.\nHence we use the half-width-at-half-maximum of the resulting model vertical\ndistribution to define the scale height as was done in Narayan & Jog (2002a,b).\n\n3.2 Input Parameters\nWe require the vertical velocity dispersion and the surface density of each of\nthe two galactic disc components to solve the coupled set of equations at a\ngiven radius. The central stellar surface density is derived directly from the\noptical surface photometry (Matthews et al. 1999) by assuming a reasonable\nstellar mass-to-light ratio. The deprojected B-band central surface brightness\nof UGC 7321 (corrected for extinction) translates to a central luminosity density of 26.4 M\u2299 pc\u22122 . Using the B \u2212 R color of the central regions (\u223c1.2;\nMatthews et al. (1999) ) and the \"formation epoch: bursts\" models from Bell\n& de Jong (2001) predicts (M/L)\u22c6 = 1.9, which we adopt here. (Other models\nby Bell & de Jong give values of (M/L)\u22c6 ranging from 1.7 to 2.1). This in turn\nyields a central stellar surface density of 50.2 M\u2299 pc\u22122 for UGC 7321.\nThe stellar velocity dispersion of this galaxy has been indirectly estimated to\nbe 14.3 kms\u22121 at the centre of the galaxy (R = 0) (Matthews 2000). This is\nvery close to the value of the central (vertical) stellar velocity dispersion (16\nkms\u22121 ) for the dwarf spiral galaxy UGC 4325 measured by Swaters (1999),\n6\n\n\fTable 2\n3D grid of dark halo parameters scanned\nP arameter\n\nRange\n\nResolution\n\n\u03c10 (M \u2299 pc\u22123 )\n\n0.0001 \u2212 0.1\n\n0.0001\n\n0.001 \u2212 0.5\n\n0.001\n\nRc (kpc)\n\n1.5 \u2212 12\n\n0.1\n\np\n\n1\u22122\n\n0.5\n\nand to the value (20 kms\u22121 ) estimated analytically for the superthin galaxy IC\n5249 by van der Kruit et al. (2001). We assume the central value of velocity\ndispersion to fall off exponentially with radius with a scale length of 2 Rd\n(which is equal to 4.2 kpc for UGC 7321) as is seen in the Galaxy (Lewis\n& Freeman 1989). Uson & Matthews (2003) give the deprojected H i surface\ndensity for UGC 7321 as a function of radius. The velocity dispersion of H i is\nobtained from the Gaussian fits to the edges of position-velocity cuts on the\nobserved data. This gives a value between 7-9 kms\u22121 . The data are consistent\nto the typical value of the H i dispersion in other galaxies (See \u00a75.2 for a\ndetailed discussion).\nThe molecular hydrogen gas, H2 , has not been taken into account, as it appears\nto be dynamically insignificant compared to the other components of the disc.\nMatthews & Gao (2001) detected a weak CO signal from the central \u223c2.7 kpc\nof UGC 7321, which translates to a total molecular hydrogen mass of H2 \u2248\n2.3 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 (although this value is uncertain by at least a factor of 2-3 as a\nresult of uncertainties in optical depth effects and the appropriate value of the\nCO-to-H2 conversion factor). This corresponds to a mean H2 surface density\nof \u03a3H2 \u2248 1 M\u2299 in the inner galaxy, which agrees fairly well with independent\nestimates from the dust models of Matthews & Wood (2001) and from a study\nof the distribution of dark clouds from Hubble Space Telescope images (J. S.\nGallagher & L. D. Matthews, unpublished). Therefore, the presence of H2 has\nbeen ignored in subsequent calculations.\n\n4\n\nResults and analysis\n\nWe perform an exhaustive scanning of the grid of parameters characterizing\nthe dark matter density profile to obtain an optimum fit to both the observed\nrotation curve and the scale height data. To start with, we consider a spherical\nhalo (q = 1) for simplicity.\nWe vary the remaining three free parameters characterizing the density profile\nof the halo (see eq. (5)) within their respective feasible ranges (as summarized\n7\n\n\fin Table 2), and obtain the contribution of the halo to the rotation curve for\neach such grid point in this three-dimensional grid. The power-law density\nindex p is allowed to take the values 1, 1.5 and 2 successively. Here, a value of\np = 1 corresponds to the standard isothermal case used routinely for simplicity\nand also because it corresponds to the flat rotation curve. The value of p =\n1.5 refers to the NFW profile Navarro et al. (1996) at large radii, whereas p =\n2 gives an even steeper dark-matter halo profile, as was found for the Galaxy\ncase Narayan et al. (2005). For each value of p, the core density \u03c10 and the\ncore radius Rc are varied as given in Table 2 to ensure an exhaustive scanning\nfor the dark matter halo parameters since we have little prior knowledge of\nthe plausible values these parameters can take in a superthin galaxy.\n\n4.1 The rotation curve constraint\nThe total rotational velocity at each radius is obtained by adding the contribution from the stars, the gas and halo in quadrature as\n2\n2\n2\nv 2 (R) = vstar\n(R) + vgas\n(R) + vhalo\n(R)\n\n(7)\n\nHere the way to obtain the different terms is discussed below. This result is\nmatched with the observed rotational velocity at all radii.\nThe deprojected gas surface density versus radius data for UGC 7321 (Uson\n& Matthews 2003) can be modelled as one which remains constant at 5 M \u2299\npc\u22122 at galactocentric radii less than 4 kpc, and which then falls off exponentially with a scale length of 2.8 kpc. The gas surface density does not include\na correction for He. For this radial distribution, we calculated the contribution of the gas to the rotation curve (using eq. (2-158) & (2-160) of Binney\n& Tremaine (1987)), and found it to be negligible compared to that of the\nstellar component. However, it was included in the calculations for the sake\nof completeness.\nThe rotational velocity at any radius R for a thin exponential stellar disc is\ngiven by Binney & Tremaine (1987)\n2\nvstar\n(R) = 4\u03c0G\u03a30 Rd y 2[I0 (y)K0(y) \u2212 I1 (y)K1(y)]\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03a30 is the disc central surface density, Rd the disc scale length and y =\nR/2Rd , R being the galactocentric radius. The functions In and Kn (where\nn=0 and 1) are the modified Bessel functions of the first and second kind,\nrespectively.\n8\n\n\fFor the spherical halo, the rotational velocity, vhalo (R), is given by\n2\nvhalo\n(R) =\n\nGMhalo (R)\nR\n\n(9)\n\nwhere M halo (R), the mass enclosed within a sphere of radius R for a the\ngiven halo density profile, and is obtained from the density as given by the\nright-hand side of eq. (5).\nFor an oblate halo of axis ratio q and density index p, the circular speed\nvhalo (R) is obtained by differentiating the expression for the potential from\nSackett & Sparke (1990), and Becquaert & Combes (1997) to be:\n2\nvhalo\n(R)\n\n= 4\u03c0G\u03c10 q\n\nZ1/q R2 x2 [1 +\n\n(1\n\n0\n\nR2 x2\n]\u2212p\nR2c (1+\u01eb2 x2 )\ndx\n+ \u01eb2 x2 )2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u01eb = (1 \u2212 q 2 )1/2 . We obtain the value of the integral numerically in each\ncase.\nThus upon obtaining the rotation curve corresponding to each grid point, we\nperform the \u03c72 analysis comparing computed to the observed H i rotation\ncurve. The observed rotation curve is taken from Uson & Matthews (2003)\nand has 30 data points with very small error-bars (typically a few percent\nof the observed velocity amplitudes even after accounting for systematic uncertainties). It was derived by implicitly assuming a constant (Gaussian) H i\nvelocity dispersion of 7 kms\u22121 . Ideally, we should have considered only those\ngrid points which give \u03c72 values of the order of 30 (i.e., the number of data\npoints) as those giving appreciably good fits to the observed curve Bevington\n(1969). But we relax this criterion and choose a larger range of grid points\naround the minimum i.e grid points which give \u03c72 values less than 300 for\napplying the next constraint i.e the vertical H i scale height data. This allows\nus to impose the simulataneous constraints (planar + vertical) on our model.\n(See \u00a74.3 for a discussion). So finally we get 36 grid points for p = 1, 80 for\np = 1.5 and 69 for p = 2 case. As we shall see later, the final set of best-fit\nparameters obtained give reasonably good fits to both the observed rotation\ncurve and the scale height data.\n4.2 The H i scale height constraint\nFor each value of p, we obtain the H i scale height distribution beyond 3 disc\nscale lengths, for each of the grid points filtered out by the first constraint\nas discussed in the previous section. Next we perform the \u03c72 analysis of our\nmodel H i scale height versus radius curves with respect to the observed one\nand try to fit our model to the observed data only beyond 3 disc scale lengths\n9\n\n\fin keeping with the earlier studies in the literature (Narayan & Jog 2005;\nBanerjee & Jog 2008). For M31, the surface-density and therefore the vertical\ngravitational force due to the dark matter halo exceeds that of the disc only\nin the outer regions (See Fig.6 of Banerjee & Jog 2008). As the disc dynamics\nin this region are controlled by the halo alone, the above method helps us in\nstudying the effect of the halo on the scale height distribution, decoupled from\nthat of the other components. For the case of UGC 7321, at first we take the\ngas velocity dispersion to be equal to 7 kms\u22121 . However it fails to give a good\nfit to the observed data. Next we try both 8 kms\u22121 and 9 kms\u22121 successively,\nbut choose the latter for subsequent calculations as it gives much better fit to\nthe observed data as compared to the 8 kms\u22121 case.\nFor the choice of vz = 9 kms\u22121 , the best-fit core density is 0.041 M \u2299 pc\u22123\nand a core radius is 2.9 kpc, as indicated by the smallest \u03c72 value. The small\nvalue of the best-fit halo core radius thus obtained indicates that the halo\nbecomes important already at small radii. This suggests that the fitting of\nthe theoretical curve with the observed one should not be restricted only to\nregions beyond 3 Rd for an LSB galaxy like UGC 7321 as the halo is already\nimportant at small radii. Hence, we next fit the scale height data over entire\nradial range (i.e., 2-12 kpc) with the same constant vz value of 9 kms\u22121 .\nThe best-fit values change by less than a few percent compared to the above\ncase where the fit was done only beyond 3 Rd . The best-fit core density now\nbecomes 0.039 M \u2299 pc\u22123 wheras the best-fit core radius continues to be 2.9 kpc.\nSince the disagreement of the observed rotation curve with the predicted one\nis mostly in the inner galaxy, we check if the fit can be improved by reducing\nthe central value of the stellar surface density by twenty percent or so, keeping\nthe vz value contant at 9 kms\u22121 . This is reasonable as there are uncertainties\nof at least that order in evaluating both the M/L ratio and the deprojected\nsurface brightness of the stellar disc. However, this variation fails to improve\nthe results significantly.\nWe then take a cue from the nature of the mismatch of our model curve with\nthe observed one, which clearly shows the need to use a higher value of gas\nvelocity dispersion in the inner parts, while a slightly lower value is required\nin the outer regions. Also, the nature of the mismatch rules out an oblate halo\nas a possible choice as that will lower the scale heights throughout the entire\nradial range, thus making the fits worse in the inner regions. To account for\nthis, we then repeat the whole procedure by imposing a small gradient in the\ngas velocity dispersion by letting it vary linearly between 9.5 kms\u22121 at R =\n7 kpc and 8 kms\u22121 at R = 12.6 kpc. Although such a variation is ad-hoc, the\nobservational constraints on this value are weak enough to allow for a small\nvariation with galactocentric radius, with 9.5 kms\u22121 approaching the upper\nlimit allowed by the data. Using the same gradient in the inner regions, we get\na gas velocity dispersion of 10.8 kms\u22121 at R = 2 kpc. We may note here that\n10\n\n\fa similar gradient in the H i velocity dispersion was obtained in the case of the\nGalaxy (Narayan & Jog 2002b) and led to a better fit to the observed scale\nheight in the inner Galaxy (See \u00a75 for a detailed discussion). A fit to the whole\nrange of observations (2 - 12 kpc) gives an isothermal halo of spherical shape\nwith a core density of 0.043 M \u2299 pc\u22123 and a core radius of 2.6 kpc best fits\nthe observations. These values are only slightly different (within 10 percent)\nfrom the values obtained with a constant velocity of 9kms\u22121 .\n\nObserved data\n\n120\n\nFit to rotation curve only\n\nRotational velocity (kms\n\n-1\n\n)\n\nIn Fig.1, we give our best-fit for the case of constant vz = 9 kms\u22121 , and the\ncase with a vz slightly falling with radius as compared to the fit to the rotation\ncurve alone, superimposed on the observed one. Our model curves follow the\ntrend of the observed data well throughout the entire radial range.\n\nFit with v = 9 kms\n\n-1\n\nz\n\nFit with gradient in v\n\n100\n\nz\n\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nRadius (kpc)\n\nFig. 1.

Overall, the model rotation\ncurves follow the trend of the observed data.\n\nIn Fig.2, we compare the best-fit scale height distributions for the above two\ncases with the observed one. Clearly, the case with a gradient in gas velocity\ndispersion gives a remarkably better fit (\u03c72 value 2.8), although as far as \u03c72\nvalues are concerned, the case of constant vz = 9 kms\u22121 cannot be ruled out\naltogether (\u03c72 value 14.7) (This is because basic statistics suggests that the\nfit to the model is considered to be reasonably good if the \u03c72 value is of the\norder of the number of data points in the fit as discussed earlier at the end of\n\u00a74.1. Here the total number of data points in the H i scale height data is 11.)\n11\n\n\fHI scale height (pc)\n\n1000\n900\n\nObserved Data\n\n800\n\nv constant (9 kms )\n\nv with gradient\nz\n\n-1\n\nz\n\n700\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10 11\n\n12 13\n\nRadius (kpc)\n\nFig. 2.

In this case, the\nmodel curves have been fitted over the entire radial range. The model with constant\nvz predicts an H i scale height distribution that does not reproduce the observed\nvalues in the inner regions of the galaxy (R < 7 kpc). Assuming a slight gradient in\nvz clearly gives a better fit\n\n4.3 Quality of individual fits as a result of imposing two simultaneous constraints\n\nWe reiterate the fact that our method is aimed at obtaining an optimum fit to\nboth the observational constraints, namely the rotation curve and the HI scale\nheight data. This evidently results in a compromise in the quality of individual\nfits to either of the observed curves (See Fig.1 & 2). Traditional mass modelling\ntechniques resort to the rotation curve constraint alone, and therefore the\nfit is much better. However imposing two simultaneous constraints on the\ntheoretical model gives a more realistic picture than the case in which best-fit\nis sought to a single constraint alone. It is noteworthy that even when the fit is\nsought to the rotation curve alone, the best-fit Rc continues to be of the order\nof RD which is tha main result of this work. However the \u03c10 value obtained is\ndifferent in the two cases.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe dark halo properties and overall stability of superthin galaxies like UGC 7321\nare of considerable interest in the context of galaxy formation and evolution.\n12\n\n\fIn particular, such galaxies seem to pose a significant challenge to hierarchical models of galaxy formation, whereby galaxies are built-up through violent\nmergers of subgalactic clumps since such mergers may result in significant disc\nheating and trigger instabilities (e.g., D'Onghia & Burkert 2004, Eliche-Moral\net al. 2006, Kormendy & Fisher 2005). While theorists have predicted that the\nthinnest galaxy disks must require massive dark halos for stabilization (Zasov\net al. 1991; Gerritsen & de Blok 1999), little information has been available\non the dark halo properties of individual superthin galaxies until now.\nUGC 7321 is the first superthin galaxy for which both a detailed rotation\ncurve and the gas layer thickness were derived Uson & Matthews (2003). This\nhas allowed us to use both these constraints simultaneously to characterize its\ndark halo properties, as well as to obtain new insight into the stability of its\ndisc against star formation. Below we comment further on the implications of\nseveral of our key findings.\n\n5.1 The small core radius of the dark matter halo\n\nThe core radii of the dark matter halos of massive high surface brightness\ngalaxies studied so far are usually found to be comparable to their optical\nsize, or equivalently, 3-4 times larger than the exponential stellar disc length\nGentile et al. (2004). The Galaxy has a core radius of 8-9.5 kpc which is equal\n3Rd (Narayan et al. 2005) while M31 has a core radius equal to 21 kpc which\nis almost equal to 4Rd (Banerjee & Jog 2008). For UGC 7321, we find a very\nsmall core radius of 2.5-2.9 kpc, which is just slightly greater than its disc scale\nlength (Rd = 2.1 kpc). This shows that the dark matter becomes important\nat small radii consistent with previous mass-modelling of LSB spirals, based\non other techniques (de Blok & McGaugh 1997; de Blok et al. 2001). This\nis illustrated in another way in Fig.3, which gives a comparative plot of the\nsurface-density of the stars, gas and the halo with radius in this galaxy. The\nhalo surface density was calculated within the total gas scale height as was\ndone for M31 (Banerjee & Jog 2008). It clearly shows that the surface-density\nand hence the gravitational potential of the halo becomes comparable to that\nof the disc already at R = 2Rd . This behaviour is quite different from that\nof a high surface density galaxy like M31 (cf Fig.6, Banerjee & Jog 2008),\nwhere the halo contribution starts to dominate at much larger radii (5Rd ).\nOur results support the idea that superthin disks like UGC 7321 are among\nthe most dark matter-dominated of disc galaxies.\n13\n\n\fSurface density (M\n\nsun\n\npc\n\n-2\n\n)\n\n35\nStars\n\n30\n\nGas(HI)\nHalo\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10 11 12 13 14\n\nRadius (kpc)\n\nFig. 3. Plot comparing the surface-density (in M\u2299 pc\u22122 ) of the stars, gas and the\ndark-matter halo as a function of radius (in kpc). It clearly shows that the gravitational potential of the halo dominates over that of the disc as early as two disc\nscale lengths (r = 4 kpc)\n\n5.2 Dependence on gas parameters\n\n\u2022 Gradient in gas velocity dispersion As noted earlier, if we impose a constant velocity dispersion, we require a value of 9 kms\u22121 to get a reasonably\ngood fit to the observed scale height data, while an even better fit requires a\nvelocity gradient implying even larger dispersion in the inner region (Fig.2).\nIn the earlier work for the Galaxy (Narayan et al. 2005), a slope of -0.8 kms\u22121\nkpc\u22121 for the gas velocity dispersion was obtained for the inner Galaxy between 2-12 kpc (pinned at 8 kms\u22121 at 8.5 kpc) as it gave the best-fit to the\nnearly constant H i scaleheights. Oort (1962) had tried the same idea but had\nneeded a higher gradient of -2 kms\u22121 kpc\u22121 since he did not include the gas\ngravity and therefore needed a larger variation to account for the constant\nH i scaleheight in the inner Galaxy. Narayan et al. (2005) tried to constrain\nthe halo properties using the outer galaxy H i data, where they had used gas\nvelocity gradient of -0.2 kms\u22121 kpc\u22121 . This is similar to the value we have\nfor UGC 7321. This was based on the fact that some galaxies show a falling\nvelocity dispersion which then saturates to 7 kms\u22121 (See Narayan et al. 2005\nfor a discussion). Recently, Petric & Rupen (2007) have measured the H i\nvelocity dispersion across the disc of the face-on galaxy NGC 1058. The authors find the H i velocity dispersion to have a fairly complex distribution,\nbut nonetheless show a clear fall-off with radius (see Fig.8 of their paper).\nUsing this figure, one can estimate a gradient of roughly -0.1 kms\u22121 kpc\u22121 in\nthe outer disc, which is consistent with values observed for other galaxies. A\nsimilar fall-off has also been seen in NGC 6946 (Boomsma et al. 2008) as well\n14\n\n\fas in several other galaxies (Bottema et al. 1986; Dickey et al. 1990; Kamphius\n1993). So this gives some observational support to our assumption.\n\u2022 Superposition of two HI phases\nA more realistic case would be to treat the HI as consisting of two phases or\ncomponents, characterized by a warm (vz = 11 kms\u22121 ) and a cold medium\n(vz = 7 kms\u22121 ) respectively. These values match the range seen in the above\nfits and represent the two phases as observed in the Galaxy (Kulkarni & Heiles\n1988). However,observationally the fraction of mass in these two phases as a\nfunction of radius is not known. Assuming that this fraction is constant with\nradius, we let its value vary as a free parameter.\nThe best-fit \u03c72 in this case is 13.7 as compared to 2.8 for the case with a\nvelocity gradient treated earlier. Although we do not get as good a fit as was\nobtained in the case where there is a gradient in the velocity, the best-fit core\nradius Rc still comes out to be 2.5 kpc which is again of the order of RD .\nThat the dark matter dominates at small radii therefore still remains a robust\nresult irrespective of the input gas parameters used. The best-fit case gives\nthe fraction of HI in the cold medium to be 0.2.\nWe had taken this ratio to be constant for simplicity. Interestingly, this assumption is justified by the recent detailed study by Dickey et al. (2009)\ninvolving absorption and emission spectra in 21 cm in the outer Galaxy. They\nuse this to map the distribution of the cold and warm phases of the HI medium,\nand surprisingly find this ratio to be a robust quantity in the radial range of\nRsun to 3 Rsun . They find this ratio is \u223c 0.15 \u2212 0.2, which agrees well with\nthe best-fit ratio 0.2 that we obtain. It is interesting that this ratio obtained\nby two different techniques is similar in the two galaxies.\nThe case with a gradient with a higher velocity dispersion within the optical\nradius gives the lowest \u03c72 value (Fig.2), which we adopt as our best case.\nWe note that this choice is not inconsistent with the constant phase ratio\nmeasured by Dickey et al. (2009) which was for the outer Galaxy.\n\u2022 High value of the gas velocity dispersion\nThe high gas velocity dispersion required to get an improved fit to the scaleheight data is surprising given the superthin nature of the galaxy, whose small\nstellar scale height implies that it is among the dynamically coldest of galactic\ndisks (e.g., Matthews 2000).\nThe origin of this high gas velocity is beyond the scope of this paper. However, independent of its origin, this high value of the gas velocity dispersion can\n15\n\n\fpartly explain why star formation is inefficent in UGC 7321. This is because,\nto first order, a higher gas dispersion will tend to suppress star formation since\nToomre Q criterion ( Q < 1) is less likely to be satisfied, hence the disc is less\nlikely to be unstable to star formation.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have modelled the LSB superthin galaxy UGC 7321 as a gravitationallycoupled system of stars and H i gas, responding to the gravitational potential\nof the dark-matter halo, and used the observed rotation curve and the H i\nvertical scale heights as simultaneous constraints to determine the dark halo\nparameters. We find that the best-fit gives a spherical, isothermal halo with a\ncentral density in the range of 0.039-0.057 M \u2299 pc\u22123 and core radius of 2.5-2.9\nkpc. The value of the best-fit core density is comparable to values obtained for\nHSB galaxies. The core radius is comparable to that of the disc scale length\nunlike HSB galaxies studied by this method, implying the importance of the\ndark-matter halo at small radii in UGC 7321. Thus we find that UGC 7321\nis dark matter dominated at all radii, and the results of our analysis support\nthe idea that the thinnest of the galaxies are the most dark matter dominated.\n\nReferences\nBanerjee, A., & Jog, C.J. 2007, ApJ, 662, 335\nBanerjee, A., & Jog, C.J. 2008, ApJ, 685, 284\nBecquaert, J.F., & Combes, F. 1997, A&A, 325, 41\nBegeman, K. 1987, Ph.D. thesis, University of Groningen.\nBell, E.F., & de Jong, R.S. 2001, ApJ, 550, 212\nBevington, P.R. 1969, Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences,\nMcGraw-Hill, New York\nBinney, J.,& Tremaine, S., 1987, Galactic Dynamics.
