This is the case when, as\nan example, particles undergo oscillatory or wavy\nmotion as a result of appropriate forces acting on\nthem, and the wave can be looked upon as some\ndisturbance propagating within a medium made\nup of those particles.\nBut, this supplementary nature of the particle\nand wave concepts does not validate itself for, in\nparticular, radiation. No forces can be imagined\nto act on radiation (propagating in the vacuum),\nand the quanta of radiation cannot be imagined to\nundergo oscillatory motions.\nWith Louis de Broglie's seminal hypothesis that\n\u03bb = h/p for a body of momentum p = mv, the\nlack of this supplementary nature of the particle\nand wave concepts got extended to even material\nbodies of mass m.\nIn describing the Fresh Fields explored during\nthe years 1926-27, the era of the development of\nthe quantum theory, Heisenberg recalled [1] that:\nBohr was trying to allow for the simultaneous existence of both particle and wave concepts, holding\nthat, though the two were mutually exclusive, both\ntogether were needed for a complete description of\natomic processes.\nBut, the question of why any \"wave\" associates\nwith a quantum has not been addressed by this\ntheory. In fact, it cannot be addressed within this\nframework, this being its assumption.\nThe \"mutually exclusive\" character of these two\nconcepts, nevertheless, underlies the modern [2]\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: waghsm.ngp@gmail.com\naddress: jetwagh@gmail.com\n\nquantum theory, which further turned out to be\nan intrinsically probabilistic framework.\nBohr considered the particle and wave concepts\nas being \"complementary\" to each other. He then\ndeveloped the principle of the complementarity of\nconcepts as the Copenhagen Interpretation of the\nQuantum Theory.\n\nII.\n\nCONCEPT OF EMISSION WAVE\n\nBut, any \"other type of\" supplementary nature\nof the particle and wave concepts, than that to be\nfound within the considerations of Section \u00a7I, was\nnot explored in the past.\nNevertheless, the following is the other type of\nthe supplementary nature of the particle and wave\nconcepts. This is, previously unrealized, new\nway in which wave phenomena happen. In\nthe history of science, this is the first time we have\ndiscovered a new way in which (transverse) waves\noccur in nature. The associated mental picture is\nas follows.\nConsider a hosepipe emitting water through its\nnozzle. Let the molecule of water move with some\nspeed along a straight line after its emission at the\nnozzle and let its speed not change, unless that\nmolecule happens to collide with another object\nalong its rectilinear path of motion.\nChange in the location of the nozzle also changes\nthe flux of water passing location directly facing it.\nAny oscillatory motion of the nozzle then produces\noscillatory change in the flux of water passing any\nlocation. The oscillatory changes in the location\nof the nozzle are \"the cause\" for the oscillatory\nchanges in the jet of water.\nNo molecule is undergoing oscillatory motion.\nThe oscillatory spatiotemporal changes in their\nflux exist, still. The particle and wave concepts\nare mutually supplementary, here.\n\n\f2\nWe will, henceforth, refer to this wave as an\nemission wave. Molecule of water can, clearly, be\nreplaced by \"the quantum\" of any kind, even the\nmassless one. Thus, the emission waves of quanta\ncan get produced by their emitter, undergoing sort\nof an oscillatory motion.\nThe massless quanta can be assumed to be\nmomentum-less, that is, as parcels of only energy.\nWhen emitted by a body, the direction of the emitted quantum can be assumed to be spherically\nsymmetrically distributed around that instantaneous location of its emitter.\nIf the wave phenomena of radiation arise indeed\ndue to aspects of emission of quanta, then such an\norigin must be consistent with Planck's law. In\nother words, the aforementioned emission origin\nfor the wave of radiation quanta or the concept of\nan emission wave needs to be consistent with the\nlaws of the black body radiation.\nAs was shown in [3], this is indeed the situation.\nIn summary, [3] showed the following.\nFrom only statistical considerations, the average\nnumber of the quanta of radiation, of energy \u01eb, in\nequilibrium within a cavity is given by\n1\nhni = \u01eb/kT\ne\n\u22121\nOn the other hand, the number of standing wave\nmodes within the frequency range \u03bd to \u03bd + d\u03bd, at\nfrequency \u03bd and enclosed within a cubical cavity\nof sides l is\n8\u03c0\u03bd 2 l3\nf (\u03bd)d\u03bd =\nd\u03bd\nc3\nThe spectral energy density of quanta contained\nwithin these modes is then:\nd\u03bd\nf (\u03bd)d\u03bd\n8\u03c0\u01eb\u03bd 2\n\u01eb hni\n=\nl3\nc3 e\u01eb/kT \u2212 1\nThis last expression reduces to Planck's formula\nfor the spectral energy density of the black body\nradiation only when we assume \u01eb = h\u03bd.\nHowever, the energy \u01eb of a light-quantum is not\nrelated to the frequency \u03bd of the wave of Light, for\nnowhere is this relation implied by this mechanism.\nNevertheless, both the particle and wave pictures\nare implied by this mechanism, albeit in the roles\nsupplementary to each other. Bohr's point of view\nthat the particle and wave pictures, both together,\nare needed for the complete description of atomic\nprocesses is clearly justified within this concept of\nan emission wave.\nIII.\n\nPROPAGATION OF EMISSION WAVE\n\nOf very specific interest now is the fact that the\nemission wave does not require any \"pre-existing\n\nmedium\" for its propagation. This follows from\nthe following considerations.\nAn emission wave propagates away from\nthe nozzle, its source, only as the molecules\nof water propagate away from it. The wave\ngets \"created\" along with the emission of\nmolecules at the nozzle and \"propagates\"\nalong with them. Any prior existence of the\n\"medium of water\" is not necessary for the\npropagation of the emission wave.\nThis above is applicable to the emission wave\nof quanta. In particular, for the radiation quanta,\nthis holds. The quantum of radiation can also be\nmomentum-less and mass-less, as these properties\nare unrelated to the mechanism of the creation of\nthe emission wave of such quanta.\n\nIV.\n\nMICHELSON-MORLEY TYPE\nEXPERIMENTS\n\nDuring the beginning of the twentieth century,\ncertain experiments attempted detection of aether,\nthe medium of propagation of light. The famous\nare the experiments of Fizeau, and of MichelsonMorley, which had relied on the phenomenon of\nthe interference of light.\nThe reasoning underlying these experiments is\nthat of the luminiferous aether being carried along\nwith them by moving bodies.\nIf light were wave propagating within an existing\nmedium of aether, then its speed in the direction\nof motion of the aether would be different than its\nspeed opposite to the direction of motion of the\nluminiferous aether.\nThen, if (monochromatic) light propagating in\nthe direction of and that propagating opposite to\nthe direction of motion of the aether were made\nto interfere in an interferometer, we would obtain\nthe interference fringes due to the path difference\ninduced by difference in the speed of propagation\nof light in these two situations.\nIf a dark fringe were to be prearranged in the\ninterference apparatus, then we should detect shift\nin the fringe as the apparatus moves about in the\nspace. Detecting this shift had been the aim of the\nexperiments mentioned before.\nAs is well known, all these experiments did not\ndetect any aether. The absence of the fringe shift\nin such experiments is then explained under the\nLorentz transformations of space-time coordinates.\nThis involves time-dilation and length contraction,\nthe latter was first pointed out by Fitzgerald as a\n\"natural consequence\" of propagation of a body\nthrough the aether.\n\n\f3\nV.\n\nEXPLAINING MICHELSON-MORLEY\nTYPE EXPERIMENTS WITHOUT\nSPECIAL RELATIVITY\n\nNow, for these experiments, we consider light as\na monochromatic emission wave. The source of the\nlight quanta is assumed to be oscillating, in this\ncase, with a single frequency \u03bd, and the quanta of\nlight to be propagating with the speed of light (in\nvacuum), all. The frequency of the emission wave\nof light is then also \u03bd.\nUnder the assumption that the quanta of light\nare mass-less, the speed of propagation of their\nemission wave is the speed of the quanta themselves. The velocity of mass-less and momentumless quanta cannot be altered as per the concepts\nof Galileo and Newton. This velocity is the same\nfor all the observers.\nThe emission wave of radiation propagates from\nthe source to its reflector. On its reflection, the\nemission wave returns to the origin, and is made\nto interfere with the main wave. The speed of the\nemission wave is always the same, irrespective of\nthe direction of its propagation, in vacuum and\nin any material like water in the case of Fizeau's\ncelebrated experiment.\nAs no medium of propagation is involved, if the\ndestructive interference is pre-arranged within the\ninterferometer, then the dark line will not shift\neven if the apparatus, ie, the interferometer, were\nto move about in the space.\nThis is an explanation of the Michelson-Morley\nexperiment. Clearly, we do not require the length\ncontraction or time dilation (and the framework of\nthe special relativity) to explain the results of the\nMichelson-Morley kind of experiments attempting\n\n[1] Heisenberg, W (1931) Physics and Beyond: Encounters and Conversations, Harper Torchbooks,\nNew York (1931), p. 76\n[2] See, for example, Schiff L I (1968) Quantum Mechanics (New Delhi: McGraw-Hill Kogakusha)\n[3] Wagh S M (2009) Emission Origin for the Wave\nof Quanta, electronic version available as\nhttp://arxiv.org/physics/0907.1210\n[4] Dirac P A M (1927) The Quantum Theory of the\nEmission and Absorption of Radiation, Proc.

When a light\nquantum is absorbed it can be considered to jump\ninto the zero state, and when one is emitted it can\nbe considered to jump from the zero state to one in\nwhich it is in physical evidence, so that it appears\nto have been created.\nThis picture is then needed along with the emission view for the wave of light, and the massless,\nmomentum-less, nature for the energy quanta of\nlight. The light beam reflected by the reflector is\nthen produced as a result of the complete absorption of the energy quanta incident on it, and the\ntotal re-emission of the energy quanta constituting\nthe reflected beam of light.\nThe mathematical framework underlying such\nprocesses is [5\u201310] that of the Universal Relativity.\nThe details of this framework are however beyond\nthe natural scope of the present discussion.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to Dilip Deshpande and Sandeep\nDeshpande for helpful discussions.\nThis article is dedicated to fond memories of\n(Late) Professor P C Vaidya and (Late) Professor\nGeoffrey Burbidge, we missing the opportunity of\nhosting the latter during an IAGRG Meeting held\nat Nagpur in 2001.\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/physics/0602032\n[7] Wagh S M (2006) Universal Theory of Relativity\nand the \"Unification\" of Fundamental Physical Interactions and references therein.\nhttp://arxiv.org/physics/0602042\n[8] Wagh S M (2006) Beyond Einstein: Are we all\nafraid of the Truth?, electronic version available\nas: http://arxiv.org/physics/0603149\n[9] Wagh S M (2006) On the significance of the Braxmaier et al.
