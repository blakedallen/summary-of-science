X-rays: stars \u2013 stars: neutron \u2013 stars: magnetic fields \u2013 individual: RX J0806.4-4123\n\n1. Introduction\nThe ROSAT all-sky survey source RX J0806.4-4123\n(1RXS J080623.0-412233) was suggested as candidate for\nan isolated neutron star (INS) by Haberl et al. (1998)\nbased on X-ray properties of this source similar to the established cases RX J1856.5-3754 (Walter et al. 1996) and\nRX J0720.4-3125 (Haberl et al. 1997). While the latter\ntwo (the brightest in the sample of INSs discovered with\nROSAT) were optically identified with mV \u223c 25.6 (Walter\n& Matthews 1997) and mB \u223c 26 (Motch & Haberl 1998;\nKulkarni & van Kerkwijk 1998) blue objects, respectively,\noptical observations of RX J0806.4-4123 were only able to\nderive a limiting B magnitude mB > 24 for a possible optical counterpart (Haberl et al. 1998). High resolution X-ray\nspectra obtained from RX J1856.5-3754 and RX J0720.43125 have revealed no evidence for photospheric absorption or emission features and are well modeled as blackbody radiation with little interstellar absorption (Paerels\net al. 2001; Burwitz et al. 2001).\nToday seven ROSAT discovered INSs (hereafter dim\nINS) are known (see references in Motch 1999; Zampieri\net al. 2001) with RX J0720.4-3125 (rotation period\nP =8.39 s; Haberl et al. 1997), RX J0420.0-5022 (P =22.7 s;\nHaberl et al. 1999) and RBS 1223 (P =5.16 s; Hambaryan\net al. 2002) showing pulsations in the X-ray flux.

Haberl, e-mail: fwh@mpe.mpg.de\n\u22c6\nXMM-Newton is an ESA Science Mission with instruments\nand contributions directly funded by ESA Member states and\nthe USA (NASA)\n\nemission has been detected yet from these objects. While\nlittle doubt is left that these objects are indeed INSs, the\norigin of their X-rays is still a matter of debate. If we\nsee thermal emission from young cooling neutron stars,\nthe observed blackbody temperatures in the range of 50\u2013\n120 eV imply ages younger than \u223c 106 years for standard\ncooling curves. Older neutron stars may be re-heated by\naccretion of interstellar matter, producing X-ray luminosities sufficiently high to be observable. However, the accretion rate strongly depends on the velocity of the neutron\nstar relative to the interstellar medium, and the neutron\nstar must rotate slowly enough to allow the matter to\nenter the magnetosphere (see the review of Treves et al.\n2000). The recent estimates of a pulse period derivative\nof (0.7 \u2212 2.0) * 10\u221211 s s\u22121 from RBS 1223 (Hambaryan\net al. 2002) and \u223c 10\u221214 s s\u22121 from RX J0720.4-3125\n(Zane et al. 2002) with inferred magnetic field strengths of\n\u223c2*1014 G and \u223c 1013 G, respectively, favour the models\ninvoking a young (or middle-aged) cooling neutron star\nrather than the accretion heating, at least for these pulsating sources1 . By virtue of this, the dim nearby neutron\nstars are suggested to be different from anomolous X-ray\npulsars which have been proposed to be powered either by\nsuperstrong magnetic fields (Thompson & Duncan 1996)\nor accretion (Mereghetti & Stella 1995).\n1\nKaplan et al. (2002) derived a less stringent upper limit for\n\u1e56 for RX J0720.4-3125 by not including XMM-Newton data,\nbut also their results support the interpretation that this source\nis a cooling neutron star.\n\n\f2\n\nHaberl & Zavlin: An XMM-Newton observation of the isolated neutron star RX J0806.4-4123\n\nTable 1.

We\npresent an improved X-ray position, the X-ray spectrum\nand the detection of a candidate for the rotation period\nof the star.\n\n2. The XMM-Newton observation\nXMM-Newton (Jansen et al. 2001) observed\nRX J0806.4-4123 during the satellite revolution #168 on\nNovember 8, 2000. Here we report on the analysis of\nthe data collected with the European Photon Imaging\nCameras (EPICs) based on MOS (EPIC-MOS1 and\n-MOS2, Turner et al. 2001) and pn (EPIC-pn, Str\u00fcder\net al. 2001) CCD detectors which are mounted behind\nthe three X-ray telescopes (Aschenbach et al. 2000).\nAll cameras were operated in the Full-Frame mode\n(FF) providing data over a field of view of \u223c13\u2032 radius.\nFurther details of the EPIC observations are summarized\nin Table 1. The data were processed using the XMMNewton analysis package SAS version 5.2 to produce the\nphoton event files and tools from version 5.3 for further\nspatial, spectral and timing analysis. The event times\nwere corrected to solar barycenter using the SAS task\n\"barycen 1.13.1\" (in which a timing problem present in\nolder versions has been solved).\n\nX-ray image. To identify possible optical counterparts to\nthe X-ray sources, finding charts were produced using the\nDSS2 (red) image. To secure the identification, the following criteria were applied: (i) only X-ray sources which\nwere detected by at least two EPIC instruments were used,\n(ii) a stellar-like object was found in the X-ray error circle, and (iii) both X-ray (spectral) and optical properties\n(R and B magnitudes as derived from the USNO A2.0\ncatalogue produced by the US Naval Observatory) must\nbe compatible with a star. This resulted in the identification of five X-ray sources with field stars as summarized in\nTable 2. Hardness ratios are defined as HR1 = (B+A)/(BA) and HR2 = (C+B)/(C-B) with A, B and C as count\nrates in the energy bands 0.3\u20131.0, 1.0\u20132.0 and 2.0\u20137.5 keV,\nrespectively. Coronal emission from stars is characterized\nby relatively soft X-ray spectra with the bulk of emission below 2 keV. This results in negative values for both\nhardness ratios with HR1 depending on the amount of interstellar absorption (see also Haberl 2002). HR2 values\nof weak sources are often undetermined due to the lack\nof statistics in the 2.0\u20137.5 keV band. For comparison the\nX-ray properties of the target are also shown in Table 2.\nUsing the SAS task \"eposcorr\" the X-ray source positions were corrected to the USNO A2.0 catalogue reference frame by minimizing the differences in X-ray to\noptical position for the five field stars. The uncertainties\non the required coordinate shifts can be regarded as the\nremaining systematic error of the X-ray bore-sight and\nare 2.1\u2032\u2032 , 3.1\u2032\u2032 and 2.5\u2032\u2032 for pn, MOS1 and MOS2, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the B-band image of the area around\nRX J0806.4-4123 as obtained by Haberl et al. (1998) with\nthe three error circles derived from the EPIC instruments\nafter the bore-sight correction. The corresponding position deduced from the pn image is RA = 08h 06m 23.s 47\nand Dec = \u201341\u25e6 22\u2032 32.\u2032\u2032 3 (J2000.0). The error circles obtained from the EPIC data agree with each other and are\ncompletely inside the ROSAT circle. This confirms that\nnone of the surrounding stars is responsible for the X-ray\nemission from RX J0806.4-4123.\n\n2.2. The temporal behaviour of RX J0806.4-4123\n2.1. The X-ray position of RX J0806.4-4123\nHaberl et al. (1998) derived an error radius of 11\u2032\u2032\n(90% confidence) from the ROSAT PSPC observations of\nRX J0806.4-4123. The error is dominated by systematic\nuncertainties in the attitude reconstruction which could\nnot be reduced due to the lack of other X-ray sources with\noptical counterparts detected in the field of view to define\na reference coordinate frame. In order to find field stars\nin the EPIC images, a standard source detection analysis using combined box sliding and maximum likelihood\ntechniques as available in SAS, was performed simultaneously in the three energy bands 0.3\u20131.0, 1.0\u20132.0 and\n2.0\u20137.5 keV. This yielded 50, 29 and 33 detections with\nexistence likelihood larger than 10 in the pn, MOS1 and\nMOS2 images, respectively. Fig. 1 shows an EPIC-pn soft\n\nEPIC light curves of RX J0806.4-4123 were extracted in\nthe 0.12\u20131.2 keV energy band (using events with pixel\npatterns 0-12) which covers most of the X-ray spectrum\n(see the next Section). The light curves show no significant variations over the duration of the observation with\naverage net count rates of 1.81 cts s\u22121 , 0.369 cts s\u22121 and\n0.405 cts s\u22121 in the pn, MOS1 and MOS2 detectors, respectively (Fig. 3). To search for periodicities on short\ntime scales, we used 29,549 events extracted from a circle\nwith radius of 45\u2032\u2032 centered on the position of the target\nin the pn data. Of these selected events, about 97.5% were\nestimated to belong to the source.

We performed the Z12 test\nin the \u2206f = 0.001 \u2212 3 Hz frequency range with a step of\n5 * 10\u22126 Hz. The oversampling by a factor of 10 (compared\nto the expected widths of 1/Tsp of the Z12 peaks, where\nTsp = 15.7 ks is the observational time span) was chosen\nto resolve separate Z12 peaks and to assure that no peak\ncorresponding to a periodic signal is missing. As the variable Zn2 has a probability density function equal to that of\n\u03c72 with 2 * n degrees of freedom (e. g., Bendat & Piersol\n1986), the probability to obtain a noise peak of a given\nZ12 height in one trial is exp(\u2212Z12 /2). The number of independent trials in the chosen frequency range estimated\nas N = \u2206f Tsp = 47.1*103 puts a lower limit on a Z12 value\nto be yielded by a periodic signal with a probability p > 0,\n\nFig. 2. B-band CCD image around the X-ray position of\nRX J0806.4-4123 (from Haberl et al. 1998). The circles\nrepresent the position uncertainties derived from pn (radius 2.1\u2032\u2032 ), MOS1 (3.1\u2032\u2032 ) and MOS2 (2.6\u2032\u2032 ) which include\nstatistical and (dominating) systematic X-ray errors and\na 0.25\u2032\u2032 error from the USNO A2.0 positions.\n\nZ12 > 2 log(N ) = 21.5 (peaks with Z12 < 21.5 are regarded\nas noise with a probability of 100%). This test resulted in\nonly one peak higher than that lower limit, Z12 = 33.9 at\nthe frequency f\u2217 = 0.087936 Hz (see Fig. 4). The probability to obtain by chance a peak of Z12 = 33.9 in N independent trials is p = N exp(\u2212Z12 /2) = 2.0 * 10\u22123 , which\ncorresponds to a detection of pulsations at a confidence\nlevel of C = (1 \u2212 p) * 100% = 99.8%, or 3.1\u03c3. Involving\nhigher harmonics gives values Z22 = 42.9, Z32 = 43.0 and\nZ42 = 43.2 at the same frequency f\u2217 . These numbers indicate that, according to the H-test suggested by de Jager\net al. (1989), there is a statistically significant contribution from the second harmonic. A probability to obtain a\nnoise peak of Z22 = 42.9 in one trial is only p = 1.1 * 10\u22128\nand in N independent trials is p = 5.1 * 10\u22124 , that increases the significance of the period detection up to a\n3.5\u03c3 level. We note this Z22 peak is highest in the frequency\n\n\f4\n\nHaberl & Zavlin: An XMM-Newton observation of the isolated neutron star RX J0806.4-4123\n\nrange chosen for the periodicity search (all other Z22 peaks\nare below 27.0 and produced by noise with probabilities\np > 94%). We also performed the Zn2 -test adding 14,210\nsource photons detected with two MOS cameras to the pn\ndata. The increase of the total statistics by about 50% results only in small increments in Zn2 values (Z12 = 37.5 and\nZ22 = 43.9 at the same frequency f\u2217 ) and significance of\nthe detected signal (to a 3.6\u03c3 level). That can be explaind\nby the low time resolution of the MOS data (see Table 1)\nwhich should lead to a strong smearing of the weak signal.\nTo determine the pulsation frequency and its uncertainties more accurately, we applied the Odds-ratio\nmethod by Gregory & Loredo (1996) based on the\nBayesian formalism. The frequency-dependent Odds-ratio\nO(f ) specifies how the data favour a periodic model of\na frequency f over the unpulsed model. This ratio allows one to obtain the probability distribution function\np(f ) \u221d O(f )f \u22121 for a signal to be periodic in a chosen\nfrequency range (see Zavlin et al. 2000, for more details).\nFig. 4 shows the dependence of O(f ) in a range around\nthe frequency f\u2217 resulting from the Z12 test. The maximum value Omax = 1.3 * 105 is at f = f0 = 0.087940 Hz\n(f0 \u2212f\u2217 = 4*10\u22127 Hz \u226a 1/Tsp ). The uncertainties of f0 at\nthe 68% and 90% confidence levels are \u03b4f = 2.3 * 10\u22126 and\n10.5 * 10\u22126 Hz, respectively. The corresponding rotation\nperiod is P0 = 11.37139 s with uncertainties of 3.0 * 10\u22124\nand 13.6 * 10\u22124 s at the 68% and 90% levels, respectively.\nThe folded light curve extracted at f = f0 from the\npn data (see Fig. 5) reveals one broad pulse per period\nwith the pulsed fraction of fp = 6.2 \u00b1 1.0%. The MOS\nlight curve extracted at f = f0 shows a remarkable similarity with that obtained from the pn data (Fig. 5), although the MOS time resolution makes its pulse somewhat broader and pulsed fraction smaller than those in\nthe pn light curve. We also note that the ROSAT PSPC\nobservation of RX J0806.4-4123 in October 1993 yielded\ntoo scanty statistics (about 900 counts) for searching a\nsignal of such a small pulsed fraction (the signal should\nresult in a too low peak with Z12 \u223c 1, which cannot be\ndiscriminated from the noise).\n\n2.3. The X-ray spectrum of RX J0806.4-4123\nThe X-ray spectra were extracted using single- and\ndouble-pixel events (pattern 0-4) from pn and pattern 0-12\nevents from MOS data. Detector response matrix files were\nused as available from the hardware groups in November\n2001 (version 6.1 for pn and v9q20t5r6 for MOS). First,\nan absorbed blackbody model with normalization parameters allowed to be free for the individual instruments was\nsimultaneously fitted to the three spectra (left panels in\nFig. 6). From the best fit a blackbody temperature of\nkT \u221e = 94\u00b11 eV2 and an upper limit for the hydrogen\ncolumn density nH of 1018 cm\u22122 were found (\u03c72\u03bd = 2.9 for\n\nFig. 3.

The radius of the emitting area derived\nfrom the blackbody fit is R\u221e \u2243 0.6 (d/100 pc) km. Fitting\nthe pn and MOS spectra separately yields blackbody temperatures of kT \u221e = 97 \u00b1 1 eV and 91 \u00b1 1 eV for the pn\nand MOS data, respectively (\u03c72\u03bd = 2.5 for 224 dof).

For comparison, Haberl\n\u221212\net al. (1998) derived a flux of (2.9+0.30\nerg cm\u22122\n\u22120.15 )*10\n\u22121\ns (90% confidence) from the ROSAT PSPC data.\nNonmagnetic neutron star hydrogen atmosphere models (Zavlin et al. 1996)3 fit the pn and MOS spectra fairly\nwell, resulting in the surface temperature kT \u221e \u2243 26 eV\nand a 110 pc distance to RX J0806.4-4123 assuming the\n\"canonical\" neutron star radius RNS = 10 km and mass\nMNS = 1.4 M\u2299 (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.8 for 228 dof; right panels in\nFig. 6). To account for systematic calibration uncertainties, nH was allowed to vary in fits to the spectra from the\ndifferent instruments, while the surface temperature and\ndistance were kept at the same values for all three spectra.

Discussion\nThe XMM-Newton observations of the INS candidate\nRX J0806.4-4123 revealed pulsations in its X-ray flux with\na period of 11.3714 s. This is well within the range of 5.16\ns to 22.7 s observed from three other dim INSs. Although\ndetected at a statistical level of 3.5\u03c3, the similar pulse\nprofiles seen in the data from all EPIC instruments inspire confidence that the modulation is real and indicates\nthe rotation period of the neutron star. The pulsed fraction of 6.2% is the weakest detected so far in X-rays from\nthese objects (9% in the X-ray flux of RX J0720.4-3125,\nCropper et al. (2001); 20\u00b12% in RBS 1223, Hambaryan\net al. (2002); 43\u00b114% in RX J0420.0-5022, Haberl et al.\n(1999)). Such a modulation is too small to be found in\navailable data of any of the other dim INSs. For example,\nonly an upper limit of 4.5% was derived from a 450 ks\nChandra observation of RX J1856.5-3754 (Ransom et al.\n2002). A simplest explanation for a small pulsed fraction in X-ray radiation from an INS is that the rotational axis of the star is nearly co-aligned with either the\nline of sight to a distant observer or the magnetic axis of\nthe star (or both). Another reason resulting in the small\npulsed fraction can be the effect of light bending in the\nstrong gravitational field near the neutron star surface\n(e. g. Pechenick et al. 1983; Riffert & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 1988),\n\nFor instance, if a neutron star is rather massive, so that\n[MNS /M\u2299 ]/[RNS /1 km] > 0.177, the whole star's surface\nbecomes visible (e. g. Zavlin et al. 1995b), which should\nresult in a strong smearing of the modulated X-ray flux\nemitted by the neutron star (even if the radiation originates from a small spot on the star's surface). However,\nassuming that radii and masses of the detected INSs are\nclustering around the canonical values of RNS = 10 km\nand MNS = 1.4 M\u2299, we may conclude that the different\nobserved pulsed fractions are mainly caused by geometrical effects, namely, different orientations of the stars' axes\nand/or different sizes of the emitting areas.\nIn this respect it is interesting that for the two dim\nINSs with the estimates on strength of the surface magnetic fields, \u223c2*1013 G for RX J0720.4-3125 (Zane et al.\n2002) and \u223c2*1014 G for RBS 1223 (Hambaryan et al.\n2002), the pulsed fraction in the X-ray flux from the object\nwith the stronger field is significantly higher, as is expected\nif the radiation is emitted from hot spots around the magnetic poles. Hot polar caps can either be produced by a\nflux of relativistic particles falling down onto the polar\ncaps from the pulsar magnetosphere or anisotropy of the\nthermal conductivity in the neutron star crust caused by a\nvery strong magnetic field (see, e. g., Greenstein & Hartke\n1983). While it looks feasible to explain the shallow modulation observed from RX J0806.4-4123 by the anisotropic\nheat conduction, Cropper et al. (2001) argue that the\nrelatively smooth temperature gradient on the neutron\nstar surface produced by this mechanism alone can only\nmarginally explain the pulse profile of RX J0720.4-3125.\nHigher pulsed fractions will be even more difficult to reconcile with this model, unless the surface radiation is intrinsically anisotropic as it may emerge from a magnetized neutron star atmosphere (Pavlov et al. 1994; Zavlin\net al. 1995a). It is clear that whatever mechanism pro-\n\n\f6\n\nHaberl & Zavlin: An XMM-Newton observation of the isolated neutron star RX J0806.4-4123\n\nFig. 6. EPIC spectra of RX J0806.4-4123 together with the best fit blackbody (left) and atmosphere (right) models.\nMost of the residuals (shown in the bottom panels) are probably caused by calibration uncertainties around instrumental absorption edges.\nduces the hot polar regions, measuring rotational period\nchanges and, therefore, magnetic field strengths for the\npulsating dim INS is crucial for understanding the origin\nof their X-ray emission.\nThe EPIC spectral data on RX J0806.4-4123 are well\nconsistent with a smooth, featureless model and can be\nfitted with both blackbody and neutron star hydrogen\n(or helium) atmosphere spectra (since there are still fairly\nlarge uncertainties in the calibration of the instrument responses at energies below 0.5-0.6 keV, we do not consider\nthe blackbody approach as rejected by the data because\nof the rather poor quality of the spectral fit). The derived\nblackbody temperature of \u224394 eV is within the range of\nvalues found for other X-ray dim neutron stars, in particular, it is close to that of RX J1605.3+3249 (Motch et al.\n1999). Extrapolating the best-fit blackbody model to the\noptical wavelength range gives a B magnitude mB \u2243 30.8\n(neglecting extinction) for a possible optical counterpart\n\u2013 much fainter flux than the upper limit put by Haberl\net al. (1998). It is worthwhile to mention that the optical counterparts found for the INSs RX J1856.5-3754 and\nRX J0720.4-3125 are significantly brighter than the extrapolations of the blackbody spectra obtained from the\nX-ray data on these two objects (Pons et al. 2002; Motch\n& Haberl 1998). The hydrogen atmosphere model fit predicts mB \u2243 26.9, still in agreement with the upper limit\nmB > 24. On the other hand, optical fluxes predicted by\nthe light-element atmosphere models for RX J1856.5-3754\n(Pavlov et al. 1996; Pons et al. 2002) and RX J0720.4-3125\n(Motch & Haberl 2002) are much brighter than the actually measured values. If RX J0806.4-4123 has properties\nsimilar to those of these two INSs, then the B magnitude\nof its optical flux is expected to be in the range of 28\u2013\n30. Utilizing the improved X-ray position derived from\n\nthe XMM-Newton data on RX J0806.4-4123, more stringent constraints on the neutron star parameters can be\nobtained from future deep optical observations.\nAcknowledgements.
