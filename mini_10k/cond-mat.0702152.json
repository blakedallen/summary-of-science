A scaling picture has\nbeen used to describe the changes in the relaxational dynamics of a single, self-avoiding chain confined to a tube\nor a pore[1, 2]. Since a self-avoiding chain under cylindrical confinement models a variety of phenomena ranging from DNA translocation through synthetic pores[3]\nto bacterial chromosome segregation[4], there have been\na number of simulation studies investigating its statics\nand dynamics[1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In this paper, we use theory and simulations to study the dynamics of a single,\nself-avoiding polymer confined to a slit.\nOne of the key concepts in polymer dynamics is the\nrelaxation of modes that describe the internal dynamics\nof a chain molecule[2, 10, 11]. We construct a theoretical\nframework for describing the relaxation of the modes of\na confined, self-avoiding chain in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions, by extending the Rouse model[10].\nOur analysis shows that the anisotropy, introduced by\nthe slit geometry, leads to dramatically different relaxations of the longitudinal and transverse modes. This\neffect, in turn, changes the nature of the motion of single monomers, and the collective dynamics of the selfavoiding chain. We perform simulations using the bondfluctuation model[12], and show that the results can be\nexplained, semi-quantitatively, by our theoretical model.\nExplicit theoretical results for the relaxation of Rouse\nmodes, presented this work, provide a powerful tool for\npredicting fine scale and large scale motion of biopolymers within the confines of a cell.\n\nmodel[10, 13]:\n\u03b6\n\nIf excluded volume and hydrodynamic interactions are\nignored, the dynamics of an unconfined, ideal chain\n(without self-avoidance) is well described by the Rouse\n\n(1)\n\nwhere xn denotes the position of the nth monomer of\nT\nsize b, k = kB\nb2 , gn (t) is a random force arising from the\nsolvent surrounding the polymer, and \u03b6 is the friction\nconstant of a single monomer. Considering dynamics at\nlength scales much larger than the individual monomer\nsize b,\nxn+1 \u2212 2xn + xn\u22121 \u2248\n\n\u2202 2 x(n)\n,\n\u2202n2\n\n(2)\n\nand Eq. (1) becomes a partial differential equation:\n\u03b6\n\n\u2202 2 x(n, t)\n\u2202x(n, t)\n+ g(n, t) .\n=k\n\u2202t\n\u2202n2\n\n(3)\n\nThe random force, g(n, t), is Gaussian and is characterized by the following correlations:\n< gj (n, t) >= 0\n< gj (n, t)gk (n\u2032 , t\u2032 ) >=\n\n(4)\n\n2kB T \u03b6\n\u03b4jk \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\u03b4(n \u2212 n\u2032 ) (5)\nN\n\nwith j and k being the cartesian components of g(n, t),\nand N the number of monomers in the chain. The normal\nmodes of the above equation are the Rouse modes, and\nthey decay exponentially with characteristic time scales\nthat depend on the mode index[10, 13].\nA major missing piece in the above description is excluded volume interactions[13]. The inclusion of these interactions (or confinement) introduces couplings between\nthe Rouse modes, and is described by an equation of the\nform:\n\u03b6\n\nROUSE MODES\n\n\u2202xn\n= k(xn+1 \u2212 2xn + xn\u22121 ) + gn (t)\n\u2202t\n\n\u2202 2 x(n, t)\n\u2202x(n, t)\n+ g(x, t) + F(n, t)\n=k\n\u2202t\n\u2202n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere F(n, t) represents the force on the nth monomer\ndue to all the other monomers, or due to the confining\ngeometry. The presence of this term couples the Rouse\nmodes, and in general, this equation has no analytic solution. An approach that has been used for unconfined,\n\n\f2\nself-avoiding, polymers is to assume that the dynamics\ncan still be described by decoupled Rouse modes[13], but\nwith renormalized parameters. Bond fluctuation algorithm simulations indicate that for such polymers, the\nRouse modes are indeed weakly coupled[12] and that\nthe renormalized Rouse modes describe the dynamical\nbehavior. The relaxation of the modes is characterized\n2\u03bd\nby a time scale \u03c4p \u2243 pN\n2\u03bd+1 , where the mode index p =\n0, 1, 2, ..... , and \u03bd is the Flory exponent: \u03bd = 3/(d + 2)\n3/2\nwith d being the spatial dimension[10]. In 2D, \u03c4p \u2243 Np5/2 .\nThe longest relaxation time is \u03c41 \u221d N 2\u03bd+1 , and is associated with the reorientation or rotation of the polymer[10].\n\nRelaxation of Rouse Modes for Confined Polymers\n\nIn this work, we construct a framework for describing\nRouse modes in confined polymers. To facilitate discussion, we briefly outline the steps leading to the results for\nunconfined polymers with self-avoidance. Neglecting the\ncoupling between Rouse modes leads to a set of linear\nequations for the mode amplitudes Xpj [10, 14]:\n\u2202Xpj\n\u03b6p\n= \u2212kpj Xpj + gpj (t) .\n\u2202t\n\n(7)\n\nHere\n\nBLOB MODEL FOR SLIT GEOMETRY\n\nFor an unconfined polymer, consisting of N monomers\nof size b, represented as a self-avoiding-walk (SAW), the\nradius of gyration scales as[16]:\nRg \u223c bN \u03bd\n3\n\u03bd =\nd+2\n\n(12)\n\nUpon confining this SAW to a slit, we expect the exXpj =\n\n1\nN\n\nZ\n\nN\n\ndn cos\n\n0\n\n\u0010 p\u03c0n \u0011\nN\n\nxnj (t) ,\n\n(8)\n\nand \u03b6p = 2N \u03b6 for p > 0, \u03b60 = N \u03b6. All the self-avoidance\nand boundary effects are incorporated through the kpj\nterm. Requiring that in the long time limit, the Rouse\nmodes have the correct equilibrium distribution, implies\nthat[13]:\nkpj =\n\nkB T\n2 >\n< Xpj\neq\n\n(9)\n\nwhere < . >eq is an equilibrium average. The exact ex2\npression for < Xpj\n>eq can be derived using Eq.(8):\n<\n\nThe generalized Rouse model treats a confined, selfavoiding polymer as an ideal polymer with renormalized\nspring constants. The utility of the approach relies on access to reliable results for the static correlations between\nmonomers, < (xmj \u2212 xnj )2 >eq . The time scales associated with the relaxation of the Rouse modes, and ultimately the dynamics of the chain and single monomers\ncan be obtained, once these static correlations are known.\nThe task at hand is, therefore, to find an appropriate\nmodel for the equilibrium correlations for confined polymers and to predict the dynamical behavior using Eqs.\n(7)-(11)[15].\nThe next section is devoted to discussing appropriate\nforms for static correlations function of a confined, selfavoiding polymer.\n\n2\nXpj\n\n>eq\n\nZ NZ N\n\u0010 p\u03c0n \u0011\n1\ndndm\ncos\n= \u2212\n2N 2 0\nN\n\u0010 p\u03c0m \u0011 0\ncos\n\u00d7 < (xnj \u2212 xmj )2 > (10)\nN\n\n2\nAs shown by Doi and Edwards[13], for p \u226b 1, < Xpj\n>eq\ncan be expressed as:\n\n<\n\n2\nXpj\n\n>eq\n\nwhere u = m \u2212 n.\n\nZ N\n\u0010 p\u03c0u \u0011\nN\n\u00d7\ndu cos\n= 2 2\n4p \u03c0 0\nN\n\u2202 2 < (xmj \u2212 xnj )2 >eq\n\u2202n\u2202m\n\n(11)\n\nFIG. 1: Sample configuration from simulation of a 2-D polymer confined to a tube. Circles indicate rough shape of the\nblobs and have a size on the order of the tube width, L.\n\ncluded volume effects to change the monomer-monomer\ncorrelation functions. The scaling of these correlations\nwith the tube width and length of the polymer has often been described by the blob model[2]. Mean-field\napproaches have also been used to model these static\ncorrelations[6, 17].\nIn a slit of width L, the first effect of confinement is\nto make the polymer conformations anisotropic[18], and\nthe shape needs to be characterized by a transverse (R\u22a5 )\nand a longitudinal (R|| ) length scale. For widths, L < Rg ,\nwhere Rg is the radius of gyration of the unconfined polymer, confinement has the effect of stretching the polymer\nin the axial direction and screening out the excluded volume interactions beyond a length scale comparable to\nL. The polymer can be visualized as a succession of\nblobs with excluded-volume effects being maintained for\ndistances smaller than the blob size[2]. The number of\nmonomers per blob, g, can be calculated by requiring\nthat the radius of gyration of these monomers matches\n\n\f3\nthe blob length scale[19, 20]. For the slit geometry, the\nlength scale of the blob is assumed to be L[15], and therefore,\n\u0012 \u00131/\u03bd\nL\ng\u223c\n(13)\nb\nThe polymer is composed of Nb = N/g blobs and has a\nlateral extension of:\nR|| =LNb = N b(b/L)1/\u03bd\u22121 = N b(b/L)1/3 ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the last relation is specific for the slit geometry\n(2D). Since the tube width confines the polymer in the\nperpendicular direction[21]:\nR\u22a5 \u221dL\n\n(15)\n\nIn papers by Edwards and Singh, estimates of polymer\nsizes were made using a mean-field approach[17]. This\nmethod was later applied to a polymer in a tube by Morrison and Thirumalai[6]. The blob predictions for the size\nof a polymer in narrow tubes agree with their estimates\nup to a factor of order unity.\nMonomer-Monomer correlations in the Blob Model\n\nThe arguments presented above hold equally well for\nsub-chains as long as the sub-chains we consider are\nlarge enough to have the asymptotic behavior of a SAW.\nTherefore, the correlations between monomers in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the slit walls are\nshould scale as:\n(\n\u00014/3\n|n \u2212 m|3/2 b2\n|n \u2212 m| < Lb\n2\n< (xn|| \u2212xm|| ) >\u223c\n\u00014/3\n|n \u2212 m|2 b8/3 L\u22122/3 |n \u2212 m| > Lb\n(16)\n(\n\u0001\n4/3\n|n \u2212 m|3/2 b2 |n \u2212 m| < Lb\n< (xn\u22a5 \u2212xm\u22a5 )2 >\u223c\n\u00014/3\nL2\n|n \u2212 m| > Lb\n(17)\nRecent simulations[15] have measured the distribution\nof blob sizes by analyzing sub chains, and for strong confinement (L < Rg ), their results are in agreement with\nthe blob model predictions. In order to proceed with the\ndynamical calculations, we assume that the correlations\nare piecewise continuous with sharp transitions between\nthe different scaling regimes represented in Eqs. (16) and\n(17).\nSimulation results for the Monomer-Monomer\ncorrelation function\n\nWe have used simulations to measure the monomer\ncorrelations and compared them to the predictions of the\nblob model outlined above. To our knowledge, these predictions have never been directly confirmed.\n\nFIG. 2: Example chain configuration. Monomers occupy each\nbox. Allowed moves are labeled with dashed arrows. Bonds\nare represented by solid lines.\n\nSimulation Technique The simulations were based on\nthe bond fluctuation algorithm, a course-grained latticebased algorithm that allows for the analysis of dynamical\nproperties of polymers[12]. As the name implies, the algorithm allows for fluctuations of bond lengths and employs only local moves of monomers. Excluded-volume\neffects are taken into account by ensuring the initial polymer configuration contains no intersecting bonds and by\nallowing only the following set of bonds:\nS = (2, 0) \u222a (2, 1) \u222a (2, 2) \u222a (3, 0) \u222a (3, 1) \u222a (3, 2)\nThis also leads to an effective monomer size b, where\nb \u2248 2.8 lattice spacings. This algorithm has been\nshown to reproduce the right scaling for polymer size\nand follow the generalized Rouse dynamics for excludedvolume polymers[10] in all spatial dimensions. It has\nbeen widely used to study the dynamics in different\nenvironments[19, 22, 23, 24]. In this paper, the simulation results are used to test the predictions of our theoretical formalism, and to explore in detail the dynamics\nof a chain confined to a slit.\nResults Monomer correlations were obtained for\nchains with N = 200, Rg = 149. This size is optimal\nin the sense that it is large enough to illustrate the effects of blobs while still yielding relaxation times that can\nbe accommodated within accessible simulation times. As\nwill be shown from our calculations of the Rouse mode\nrelaxations, the longest time scale increases as N 3 and\nas L\u22122/3 , making it difficult to determine correlations\nfunctions for long chains in a narrow slit.\nThe initial chains were generated using a back-tracking\nalgorithm which would redraw the part of the walk if a\nnew segment had not been placed within 30 attempts.\nTo ensure little biasing from the generation of the initial\nwalk, chains were equilibrated by allowing the chain to\nundergo 108 monte carlo steps (mcs) (200\u2217108 attempted\nmoves). After equilibration, data was sampled every 103\nmcs for runs of 108 mcs. The process was repeated for 10\n\n\f4\ninitial configurations and averaging was conducted over\nall sampled configurations of all runs as well as over the\nwhole chain. This averaging leads to the data shown in\nFigs. 3 and 4.\nThe scaling laws observed in simulations are in broad\nagreement with the blob picture for the monomer correlations perpendicular to (Fig.3) and parallel to (Fig.4)\nthe walls. In reporting the results of the simulations, we\nmeasure all lengths in units of b. Fig. 3 demonstrates\nthat the data for the transverse correlations for different\nvalues of L can be made to scale if |n \u2212 m| is divided by\nL4/3 and the correlations are scaled by L2 , confirming\nthe form of Eq. 17, and the scaling of the blob size g(L)\nas L1/\u03bd (\u03bd = 3/4 in 2D). The results for the correlations\nin the longitudinal direction indicate a crossover between\ntwo power laws, as shown in Fig. 4.\nAccording to the authors' knowledge, this is the first\ndirect test through simulations of distinct scaling regimes\npredicted by the blob model. Since there is broad support for the blob-scaling picture of monomer correlations\nfrom the simulations, we proceed to utilize these results\nfor calculating the properties of the Rouse modes under\nconfinement.\n\nFIG. 4: < (xn|| \u2212 xm|| )2 > versus slit width for the same set\nof parameters as Fig. 3.

All lengths are measured in units of\nthe lattice spacing\n\nRELAXATIONS OF ROUSE MODES\n\nTo study the dynamical correlations in the anisotropic\ngeometry of the slit, we analyze the transverse modes,\nXp\u22a5 , and longitudinal modes , Xp|| , separately.\nTransverse Modes The transverse modes correspond\nto taking j to be in the direction perpendicular to the slit\naxis. The blob picture provides a natural scale of pmax =\nN/g = N b4/3 /L4/3 , separating the large p from the small\np regime. For p << pmax , we use Eq.(17) directly in\n\n2\nEq.(10). For these modes, < Xp\u22a5\n>eq \u2243 A\u2212 B(p/pmax )2 ,\n10/3\n\nL\n. In the regime where\nwhere the constant A = 8\u03c0N\nb4/3\nL << Rg , modes with p > pmax , satisfy the condition\nfor the use of Eq. (11), since these mode numbers satisfy\np > N (b/Rg )4/3 = N . Combining Eqs. (17) and (11)\nwe, therefore obtain, for p > pmax ,\nZ (L/b)4/3\n\u0010 p\u03c0u \u0011 b2\nN\n2\ndu cos\n(18)\n< Xp\u22a5\n>eq = 2 2\n4p \u03c0 0\nN u1/2\n2\n< Xp\u22a5\n>eq =\n\nN 3/2 b2\nFc\n3/2\n2 p5/2 \u03c0 2\n\n\u0012r\n\n2p\npmax\n\n\u0013\n\n(19)\n\nIn the above equation, and below, we set b = 1, and\n\u03b6/kB T = 1. The relaxation of the transverse modes is\nexponential with a time scale:\n\u03c4p\u22a5 =\n\n\u03b6p\n2\n= N < Xp\u22a5\n>eq\nkp\u22a5\n\n(20)\n\n\f5\nA reasonable approximation of Fc (x), the Fresnel Cosine\nfunction, is a linear function of the argument for x \u226a\n1 and 1/2 for x \u226b 1. For p > pmax ,the argument of\nFc (x) is always greater than 1, and, therefore, \u03c4p\u22a5 scales\nas 1/p5/2 , which is a form identical to the relaxation of\nunconfined modes. This result provides a self-consistency\ncheck on our calculations, since the blob model assumes\nthat the correlations within the blob are identical to that\nof an unconfined chain.\n2\nThese results show that < Xp\u22a5\n>eq decreases monotonically with p, initially as A \u2212 Bp2 , and then as p5/2 .\nThe slowest transverse mode is, therefore, p = 1, and the\nassociated relaxation time is given by :\n\u03c4 \u22a5 \u221d L10/3 /(8\u03c0)\n\nFor p < pmax , we use Eq.(16) directly in Eq.(10). In the\nlimit of small slit widths, L \u226a N b, we obtain a closed\nform expression[25]:\n(1 \u2212 (\u22121)p )N 2\n+ (O)L2/3\np4 L2/3\n\n(23)\n\nIn the small p regime, therefore, the odd and even modes\nbehave differently. The odd modes exhibit a p4 decay of\n2\n< Xp||\n>eq , and dominate for small L, since the leading\nterm in Eq. 23 vanishes for the even modes. For p > N/g,\n2\nEq. 22 implies that < Xp||\n>eq decays as p5/2\nThe longest relaxation time in the longitudinal direction is determine by the relaxation of the p = 1 mode.\nand is given by:\n\u03c4 || = 2N 3 /L2/3\n\n(24)\n\nUnlike \u03c4 \u22a5 , this time-scale increases as the slit width L\ndecreases. The equilibration time is dominated by the\nrelaxation of the p = 1, longitudinal mode, and as we will\nshow from the simulations, corresponds to a collective\nrearrangement of the chain where the end-to-end vector\nchanges sign.\nIn the next sections, we will use the results for the\nRouse modes to analyze the dynamical properties of the\nconfined chain.\nCollective Dynamics\n\nThe longest relaxation time of an unconfined polymer\nchain is associated with the relaxation of the end-to-end\nvector, P(t) = RN (t) \u2212 R0 (t) and is reflected in the\nautocorrelation function:\nC(t) = hP(t) * P(0)i\n\nwhere \u03c41 is the relaxation time of the p = 1, unconfined\nRouse mode: \u03c41 \u223c N 3/2 in 2D[10].

Writing C\u22a5 (t) and\nC|| (t)) in terms of the Rouse modes[10], it becomes evident that the long-time relaxation is exponential with a\ntime scale given by the longest-lived transverse and longitudinal modes, respectively. From the analysis of Rouse\nmodes for the confined polymers, it follows, therefore,\nthat\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 1/2 2 \u0013\nt\n\u22122 \u03c0 t\nC\u22a5 (t) \u223c exp \u2212 \u22a5 = exp\n\u03c4\nL10/3\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nt\n\u2212tL2/3\nC|| (t) \u223c exp \u2212 || = exp\n(27)\n2N 3\n\u03c4\nThese results demonstrate that the collective dynamics of\na polymer confined to a slit is qualitatively different from\nan unconfined polymer. The relaxation time of the longitudinal component of the end-to-end vector increases\ndramatically as L is decreased, diverging as L \u2192 0. This\nincrease in relaxation time has been observed in earlier\nsimulations[15] and, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8 is captured\nby our simulations. Since the time scale associated with\nchanges in orientation of the end-to-end vector increases\nas N 2 L\u22122/3 , long Monte Carlo runs are required to ensure that chain configurations and their mirror images\nare sampled equally. In order to keep the simulations\nmanageable, we studied relatively short chains, N = 50\nmonomers long. The results were averaged over 109 mcs\nafter initial equilibration of 108 mcs steps and for 5 different initial configurations.\nIn the unconfined polymer, the slowest mode corresponds to the reorientation of the end-to-end vector and\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 7: Simulation Results: End-to-end correlation function\nfor component parallel to the walls for a chain with N =\n50, Rg = 53, and for slit widths of 20, 30, 40, and 5000\n(unconfined).\n\nFIG. 9: Simulation Results: Time trace of the longitudinal\ncomponent of the end-to-end vector P(t) for a chain with\nN = 50, Rg = 53, and for slit widths of (a) 40 and (b) 30.\n\nFIG. 8: Simulation Results: Observed value of longest odd\nmode versus predicted value.

Under confinement, the\nslowest mode still involves reorientation, but now the\ntime scale is expected to go as R||2 \u223c N 2 L\u22122/3 , as obtained from our analysis of the Rouse modes. Based on\nthese arguments, the reorientation events are expected to\nbecome increasingly rare as L is decreased. This expectation is borne out in our simulations, as evidenced by\nthe time traces in Fig.9.\nOne way of describing fluctuations of the confined polymer is to say that the chain fluctuates about a fixed\nshape, characterized by the direction of P(t), changing shape only occasionally. The fluctuations about\nthe shape are described by the transverse Rouse modes,\nwhich as Eq.21 shows, relax faster as the slit width is\ndecreased, and are independent of the size of the chain.\nResults from our simulations shown in Fig. 6 are consistent with these predictions. In simulations of a model\npolymer confined in a 2D box[26], it has been observed\nthat the slow modes correspond to shape changes, and\nthat the slow dynamics is not reflected directly in the\nmonomer motion. The shape of the polymer is a simpler\nvariable in the slit geometry, but a distinct separation\nbetween time scales associated with shape changes and\n\nIn this section, the effective Rouse modes are used\nto make detailed predictions for the mean-squareddisplacement (MSD) of monomers. The theory for the\nMSD of monomers should provide a framework for understanding the dynamics inside biological cells where\nmotion has been observed to be subdiffusive[27].\nStarting from Eq.(8) and making use of the fact the\nperpendicular mode index has a lower bound of N/g, the\nnumber of blobs, it can be shown that the displacement\nsquared of a monomer in the direction perpendicular to\nthe walls is\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u221e\nX\n4\nt\n1 \u2212 exp \u2212\n< (xn\u22a5 (t)\u2212xn\u22a5 (0))2 >=\nkp\u22a5\n\u03c4p\u22a5\np=(N/g)\n\n(28)\nLikewise the expression for the parallel monomer motion\nis\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u221e\nt\n2t X 4\n1 \u2212 exp \u2212\n< (xn|| (t)\u2212xn|| (0))2 >= +\nN p=1 kp||\n\u03c4p||\n(29)\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 10: Prediction for perpendicular motion from theory for\na chain of 200 monomers, monomer size 2.8, and slit width 30\n(L/Rg = 1/5). (see Eq.(28))\n\nFIG. 11: Simulation Results: Plots of MSD of the perpendicular component of the middle monomer in a chain with\nN = 200 The MSD have been rescaled by the maximum value\nof the saturation value at each L, and time has been scaled\nby, L\u221210/3 , to capture the scaling of \u03c4 \u22a5 . These scalings lead\nto data collapse for L = 20 , 35 , 50.\n\nThe main features of the perpendicular motion, as predicted by (28), are depicted in Fig.(10). Since kp\u22a5 has the\nsame functional form as the unconfined polymer modes\nfor p \u2265 N/g, the MSD exhibits a t3/5 power law that\nsaturates to a value proportional to L2 for t \u226b \u03c4 \u22a5 , the\nrelaxation time of the p = N/g mode. The explicit exponent of 3/5 can be obtained by analyzing Eq. 28 for\nt \u226a \u03c4 \u22a5 . In this limit, the sums can be replaced by integrals, and we obtain:\n< (xn\u22a5 (t) \u2212 xn\u22a5 (0))2 >\u2248\n\n216/5 b4/3 3/5\nt \u0393q (2/5) .

The results of simulations for a N = 200\nL10/3\nchain confined to slit widths ranging from 20 to 50 are\nshown in Fig. 11. As predicted by the theory, MSD for\ndifferent values of L can be collapsed on to each other by\nscaling the time t by \u03c4 \u22a5 \u223c L10/3 and scaling the MSD\nby its maximum value which increases as L2 (Fig. 12).\nThe MSD in the longitudinal direction, described by\nEq. 29, is expected to exhibit multiple regimes. The\nfunctional form of of the effective spring constants, kp|| ,\nchanges at p = N/g with a p4 increase at low p (for the\nodd modes) and a p5/2 increase for the high p modes.\nThe analysis is further complicated by the difference between odd and even modes for low mode numbers. Even\nthough there is no closed form expression for the MSD\nin the longitudinal direction, we can recover useful information about the functional forms and crossover times.\nTo accomplish this, we look at times much less than the\nlongest relaxation time of the system. With this assumption, the sum in (29) can be approximated as an integral\n\nFIG. 12: Simulation Results: Plots of saturation value of\ndisplacement squared of the perpendicular component of the\nmiddle monomer in the chain recovered from simulations.

The dashed\nlines and the arrows mark the power laws and the crossover\ntimes predicted by the short-time approximation, Eq. (32)\n\ndecay as p\u22125/2 , just as they do in the unconfined chain.\nHowever, for p \u2264 ps , there is an observed splitting in the\neven and odd modes, with the even modes seemingly exhibiting a p\u22122 behavior and the odd modes decaying as\np\u22124 . Since we can obtain data only over a limited range\n(determined by the size of the chain), these power laws\nare only approximate. The crossover at ps is a robust\nphenomenon. From our theoretical analysis, we expect\nps = N/g. For a chain of N = 200, b = 2.8 (characteristic of the bond-fluctuation model), and a slit width of\nL = 30, the blob model predicts that N/g = 8.0. The\nsimulation data (Fig.14)) is in surprisingly good agreement with this prediction. Our simulation results, therefore, support the conclusion that the statistical properties\nof the confined polymer can be understood in terms of\nthe effective Rouse modes obtained from our theoretical\nframework.\n\nwhich is proportional to \u03c4 \u22a5 . For times longer than \u03c4B|| ,\nt1/2 is the dominant behavior, and this subdiffusive motion becomes diffusive as the 0th mode starts dominating\nat \u03c4D|| [29]:\n\u03c4D|| =\n\n8b4/3 N 2 L2/3\n\u03c0\n\n(33)\n\nThese time scales, and the power laws are shown in\nFig.13.\nThe different power-law regimes correspond to physically different relaxation mechanisms. At the shortest\ntime scales, the relaxation is not affected by the confinement, and the MSD follows that of the unconfined, selfavoiding chain. At intermediate times, the polymers can\nbe thought of as an ideal chain of blobs, and blob compression dominates the dynamics[2]. The MSD, therefore, shows the sub-diffusive behavior characteristic of\nan ideal chain with no excluded volume constraint. The\nlong-time diffusive motion reflects the center-of-mass motion. An interesting observation to be made is that the\ndiffusive behavior sets in at earlier and earlier times as\nthe slit width L is decreased. This apparently counterintuitive result, however, follows from the fact that\nwith increasing confinement, transverse fluctuations decay faster, (\u03c4 \u22a5 \u223c L10/3 ), and the longitudinal motion\nof the polymer essentially looks like that of a rigid rod.\nThe reorientation events, which are the slowest dynamical process in the system, do not affect the MSD of\nmonomers.\nThe above analysis relies on our deductions for the\n2\nfunctional form of the amplitudes hXp||\ni, which determine kp|| . We have extracted the Rouse mode amplitudes from the simulations (see Fig.14) to directly verify\nthese functional forms. We find that for mode numbers\np greater than a characteristic value ps , the amplitudes\n\nFIG. 14: Simulation Results: Mode excitation vs mode number p extracted from simulation for a chain 200 monomers\nlong and a slit width of 30 lattice space.

Solid and dashed lines represent the linearized\nRouse theory predictions.\n\nWe have used our simulations to carefully measure the\nMSD of monomers in the longitudinal direction, and the\nresults are shown in Figs. 15 and 16. Our results are\nconsistent with the theoretical predictions. The short\ntime behavior is governed by a sub-diffusive, t3/5 regime,\nassociated with the unconfined polymer. There is a hint\nof an intermediate regime, governed by the slower power\nlaw of t1/2 . Finally, at long times, the MSD is observed\nto increase linearly with t. The two characteristic times\nassociated with the crossover from t3/5 to t1/2 (\u03c4B|| ) and\nt1/2 to t (\u03c4D|| ) are plotted in Fig.16 and both times are\nobserved to be monotonically decreasing with the tube\nwidths, approximately obeying the scaling predicted by\nEqs.

For the unconfined chain,\nL = 5000, the diffusive regime is barely visible at t = 106\nmcs. In contrast, for L = 10, the diffusive regime is visible at\nt = 105 mcs.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have presented a theoretical framework for analyzing the dynamics of confined, self-avoiding polymers\nthat is valid for any confining geometry. The formalism is\nbased on renormalized, effective, Rouse modes. Through\nextensive simulations, we have shown that he predictions\nof the theory are borne out for a polymer chain confined\nto a slit.\nGiven the Rouse mode framework, both collective dynamics and single monomer motion can be determined\nfrom a knowledge of the mode relaxations. Our analysis\nshows that confinement introduces multiple time scales\ninto the dynamics. The slowest mode is associated with\nthe reorientation of the end-to-end vector, and its relaxation time increases as L\u22122/3 with decreasing slit width.\nTransverse fluctuations of the chain relax on a time scale\nthat decreases as L10/3 . This latter time scale shows up\nin the monomer dynamics as a crossover time from a t3/5\nsubdiffusive behavior, characteristic of the self-avoiding\npolymer, to a t1/2 subdiffusive behavior, characteristic of\nan ideal, phantom chain. In an unconfined polymer this\nintermediate regime is absent. Under confinement, the\nmonomers exhibit pure diffusion in the longitudinal direction at times longer than \u03c4D|| \u223c L2/3 , implying that the\ndiffusive motion sets in at earlier times as the slit width is\ndecreased. This observation can be understood by noting\nthat a SAW behaves increasingly as a rigid rod as the slit\nwidth decreases and the dominant motion is that of diffusion of the center of mass. It should be remarked that in\nan unconfined chain the monomer motion becomes diffusive at time scales long compared to the reorientation, or\nrotational time scale. For the confined polymer, the single monomer motion does not exhibit the slowing down\n\nFIG. 16: Simulation Results: (a) Plot of first crossover time\nfrom t3/5 to t1/2 (\u03c4B|| ) from Fig.15.(b) Plot of first crossover\ntime from t1/2 to t (\u03c4D|| ) from Fig.15.\n\nof the dynamics associated with reorientation events in\nwhich the chain undergoes a complete back bending, reversing direction. The Rouse dynamics of an unconfined\npolymer is characterized by a single time scale, \u03c41 \u223c N 2\u03bd .\nAs we have seen, the dynamics of a polymer confined to\na slit has three distinct time scales, which scale with the\nslit width as L10/3 , L2/3 , and L\u22122/3 . The separation between the shortest, \u223c L10/3 and the longest, L\u22122/3 time\nscales grows as L is decreased, resulting in a clear separation of the longitudinal and transverse dynamics.\nThere are small discrepancies between theory and simulations that can be ascribed to one or both of two effects: (a) the lattice spacing associated with the simulation model, (b) the finite length of the polymer,\nand the limitations of statistics. The one significant\ndifference between theory and simulations is in the Ldependence of the longest relaxation time, \u03c4 || . Further\nstudies are needed to investigate the origin of this discrepancy. Within the framework of Rouse modes, a more sophisticated framework can be constructed by considering\na renormalization of the single-monomer friction coefficient, and its predictions compared to simulations. Adhering to the Rouse mode framework preserves the connection between static correlations and dynamics that is\nextremely desirable for parsing the complex dynamics of\n\n\f10\npolymers under confinement.\nThe results presented in this paper demonstrate that\nthe difference in dynamics in the longitudinal and transverse directions provides detailed information about the\neffect of tube confinement on a self-avoiding polymer.\nThese results apply as long as the confinement is weak,\ni.e., the longitudinal dimension is larger than the unconfined radius of gyration of the polymer. If the longitudinal dimension is comparable or smaller than the radius of gyration, then our results will be altered but the\nanisotropy, and especially the separation of time scales\nwill persist and be prominent for aspect ratios larger than\nunity. The latter situation applies to bacterial chromosomes. Recent research has focused on studying the role\nplayed by polymer confinement on chromosome dynamics and segregation[9]. Our results indicate that resolving\nthe transverse and longitudinal components in measurements of chromosomal dynamics would provide important diagnostic tools. Such measurements will aid the understanding of the effects of cell geometry and crowding\non the fine scale dynamics of bacterial chromosomes[27],\nand the relevance of intrinsic polymer dynamics to biological processes.\nWe would like to thank Jeremy Schmit and Jan\u00e9 Kondev for many insightful discussions, and Michael Hagan\nfor a careful reading of the manuscript.
