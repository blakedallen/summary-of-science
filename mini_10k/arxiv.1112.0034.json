The region near the boundary of the dynamically relaxed cluster\nvolume (\u223c r200 [1]), offers a direct view of cluster growth and ICM accretion [2].\nSimulations predict deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium in the outskirts of clusters\nat scales on the order of r2500 < r < r200 , well beyond the influence of cooling and AGN\nfeedback processes in the cluster core [3, 4]. Moreover, it may be that signatures of\nspatially inhomogeneous accretion from cosmic filaments are observable at these radii.\nX-ray observations of clusters at r > r500 also probe the distribution of mass to large\nradii, and in so doing provide new constraints on structure formation models [5, 6, 3].\nFinally, accurate knowledge of the mass and baryonic fraction of clusters is essential for\n\n\fFIGURE 1. Abell 1795 surface brightness (left) and temperature profiles (right). The image (center)\nshows color-coding for the radial directions probed; for clarity, only the North and South directions are\nshown in the surface brightness profile. A 4-\u03c3 difference is seen in the surface brightness between the\nNorth and South [9], and a rapid decline in temperature is seen toward all directions.\n\ncluster-based cosmological tests [7, 8]. Accurate cluster masses within r500 , for example,\nrequired for many cosmological tests, rely on knowledge of both the temperature and its\nradial gradient at r500 , and observations to larger radius are essential to determine these\nquantities reliably.\nSpatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy is one of the prime methods for mapping the\ndistribution of mass and intracluster plasma, and it is the only way to measure heavy\nelements in the gas in galaxy clusters. Although Chandra and XMM have successfully\nprobed the central regions of clusters [10, 11, 12], these instruments have difficulty\nobserving the faint emission near r200 due to their relatively high and time-variable\nbackground, and in fact conditions in the ICM beyond \u223c0.5r200 have not been well\nstudied by these observatories. Suzaku's low and stable background and substantial\neffective area, however, have already enabled observations of a handful of clusters that\nhave successfully detected ICM emission out to and even beyond r200 [13, 14, 9, 15,\n16, 17, 18]. Our own Suzaku observations of Abell 1795 [9] find significant deviations\nfrom hydrostatic equilibrium within r2500 \u2013r200 , in a cluster which appears to be relaxed\nat smaller radii. These results point to a rapidly declining temperature profile (see Figure\n1), an entropy profile that is flatter than predicted for simple hierarchical structure\nformation [2], and clearly asymmetric temperature and density profiles at large radius.\nThe steep profile may in turn result from cool, low-entropy infalling substructure, as\nsuggested by the simulations of Roncarelli et al. [3]. Indeed, Burns et al. [4] successfully\nreproduce with hydrodynamic simulations the temperature and entropy profiles seen in\nAbell 1795, suggesting that bulk flows and turbulence from accretion greatly affect the\nenergetics of the outer ICM.\n\nTOWARD A LARGE SAMPLE OF CLUSTERS WITH SUZAKU\nWhile the previous results are intriguing, the Suzaku sample has been small and it is\nunclear whether it represents clusters generally. Starting in 2010, we have embarked on\na comprehensive program of observations of a large sample of clusters with Suzaku,\nutilizing a recent XMM cluster survey [12]. This survey is the largest sample of galaxy\n\n\fTABLE 1.\n\nCluster sample\n\nCluster\nA 383\nA 773\nA 1068\nA 1413\nA 1795\nA 1914\nA 2204\nA 2667\nRXCJ 0605\n\nz\n\nkT \u2217\n(keV)\n\nr200\n(arcmin)\n\ntexp \u2020\n(ksec)\n\ndate obs.\n\n0.187\n0.216\n0.147\n0.135\n0.063\n0.174\n0.151\n0.221\n0.137\n\n5.3\n7.2\n4.7\n7.6\n5.3\n11.5\n8.6\n8.3\n5.2\n\n9.3\n9.5\n10.8\n14.8\n26.0\n14.5\n11.8\n10.0\n12.2\n\n110\n200\n200\n170\n260\n160\n140\n200\n150\n\nJuly 2010\nMay 2011\nOct 2011\nMay 2010 + archive\nJune 2009 + archive\nJune 2010\nSept 2010 + archive\nJuly 2011\nMay 2010\n\n\u2217 Average kT from [12]\n\u2020 Total Suzaku exposure time from all pointings.\n\nclusters that have been probed to \u223c r500 , and it is the first sample large enough to find\ntemperature profiles that seem to differ significantly from theoretical predictions [19].\nWith Suzaku, we are able to capitalize on this work by extending the radial coverage\nbeyond that provided by XMM to r200 , and provide robust, independent checks of the\nXMM results at smaller radii. The goals of this Suzaku project are to (1) determine the\ntemperature and density profiles to large radius for a representative sample of apparently\nrelaxed clusters, including those discrepant with numerical simulations; (2) search for\nazimuthal variations at large radius which may be indicative of the ongoing cluster\naccretion process; and (3) provide a fiducial data set for detailed comparison with high\nresolution numerical simulations.\nTo define our sample we first selected objects with high-quality XMM data to approximately r500 . This resulted in a sample with a variety of temperature profiles that were\nfalling, flat, or rising in the outer regions. The sample was further restricted using a numerical asymmetry parameter to select clusters that appear relaxed in the XMM images.\nTo maximize Suzaku observing efficiency, we further selected clusters with r200 <\n\u223c 17 arcmin, so that the entire cluster volume within r200 could be observed in no more than four\noverlapping XIS pointings, while allowing sufficient area beyond r200 for background\nestimation. Clusters were eliminated if they were too compact for the \u223c 2 arcmin Suzaku\nPSF (r200 <\n\u223c 9 arcmin), or if they were so centrally bright so that the scattered light from\nthe core would dominate cluster emission in the r500 \u2013r200 region. The current sample\nof 9 clusters is shown in Table 1; it includes Abell 1795, which does not fully meet the\ncriteria outlined above, but has extensive Suzaku data from our previous work. We also\ninclude two clusters (Abell 1413 and Abell 2204) which have single pointings from the\narchive; these data have been published [14, 15].\nAn example cluster is shown in Figure 2, with the projected temperature and surface\nbrightness profiles for Abell 2204 plotted along four radial directions. The temperature\ndrops off rapidly in each direction, although there are differences from pointing to\npointing. Both the temperature and surface brightness are well-matched in the overlap\nregion to the XMM results, which are azimuthally averaged.\n\n\fAbell 2204\nz = 0.151\n\n12 arcmin ~ 2 Mpc\n\nFIGURE 2. Abell 2204 0.5\u20132 keV combined, exposure-corrected Suzaku image (left) and profiles of\ntemperature (right top) and surface brightness (right bottom). The profiles are measured in bins shown in\nthe image by the green annuli, along radial directions with arrows corresponding to the colored points.\nThe white circle shows r200 = 2.3 Mpc. Magenta circles identify point sources and other excised features in\nthe X-ray image. The archival data from Reiprich et al. [14] are toward the northwest; those authors used\ndifferent annuli than we have in the current analysis. The surface brightness profile has been backgroundsubtracted, so that we clearly see excess emission beyond r200 ; however, the uncertainty is larger than\nshown here, as discussed in the text and in Figure 4.\n\nTHE POWER OF SUZAKU, XMM, AND CHANDRA TOGETHER\nSuzaku, XMM, and Chandra together constitute an extremely powerful tool for understanding the outskirts of clusters. As noted above, Suzaku's low background and substantial collecting area provide surface brightness sensitivity unavailable with other instruments. XMM and Chandra data provide high angular resolution that resolves the shape\nof the temperature profile near the cluster core, and excellent point source sensitivity\nin the cluster outskirts to minimize the effects of fluctuations in the background source\ndensity, as detailed below. Finally, comparison of the XMM and Suzaku data in the regions of overlap provide important cross-checks on systematic errors in temperature and\nflux at the very low surface brightness levels we hope to study.\nFor small extraction regions (\u223c 0.01 deg\u22122 ), fluctuations in the unresolved source\nbackground dominate the surface brightness uncertainty. For a typical 50 ksec exposure,\nwe can expect to resolve and exclude sources from the Suzaku data alone down to a\nflux of about 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . Assuming a differential source distribution along the\nlines of Moretti et al. [20], we expect surface brightness fluctuations in the 0.5\u20132 keV\n\u22121/2\nband to be \u03c3B = 3.9\u00d710\u221212 \u03a90.01 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 deg\u22122 , where \u03a90.01 is the region solid\nangle in units of 0.01 deg\u22122 [9]. This is 30% of the typical X-ray background level\nmeasured in our Abell 1795 Suzaku background regions, and it accounts for 40% of\nthe detected cluster emission at r500 \u2013r200 toward the north in Abell 1795 [9]. Including\nhigh spatial resolution data from XMM or Chandra allows us to remove fainter sources,\n\n\flowering our point source exclusion threshold by a factor of 10 in flux and reducing \u03c3B\nby a factor of \u223c 3\u20134. While increasing the solid angle will also mitigate fluctuations\ndue to cosmic variance, we wish to trace azimuthal variations. This requires restricting\nextraction regions to at most a few times 0.01 deg\u22122 for the less extended clusters, and\ntherefore we have required our Suzaku pointings to overlap as much as possible with\navailable XMM or Chandra data so that we can adequately eliminate or model point\nsources.\nThese clusters generally lack XMM coverage in the outskirts, so we have begun a\nparallel project to obtain Chandra snapshot observations to fill in these regions. An\nexample is illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. Including 5 ksec Chandra snapshots increases\nthe number of detected point sources by an order of magnitude and reduces our surface\nbrightness uncertainty by a factor of \u223c 3. For a given detected Chandra point source,\nwe either exclude this source from the Suzaku extraction or include it as an additional\ncomponent in the background fit, depending on the point source flux and size of the full\nextraction region. About one quarter of the Chandra observations are completed, and\nthis analysis remains ongoing.\n\nA CASE STUDY: THE OUTSKIRTS OF RXCJ 0605\nThe cluster RXCJ 0605.8-3518 (Abell 3378) appears to have a rising kT profile to r500\nin the XMM analysis [12]. We present azimuthally-averaged, deprojected gas profiles\nfrom our Suzaku observations in Figures 5 and 6. The temperature decreases beyond\nthe cluster core, as does the electron density, which is consistent with the XMM result\nin the overlap region and a \u03b2 = 0.68 profile out well beyond r200 . The entropy profile\nincreases steadily to as far as can be measured, in line with theoretical predictions [2]\nand at odds with results from previous clusters [e.g., Abell 1795; 9]. The gas fraction is\nfully consistent with the cosmic baryon fraction at large radius.\nThese results are also at odds with a recent study of the Perseus cluster [17, and\nelsewhere in these proceedings], which finds a flattening of the entropy profile (similar to\nother previous cluster studies) and an observed gas fraction well in excess of the baryon\nfraction near r200 . Such discrepancies with predictions can be explained by clumping of\nthe ICM gas; since the X-ray emissivity is proportional to the square of the gas density,\nsmall dense regions will dominate the emission, biasing the entropy lower and the gas\nfraction higher compared to extrapolation from the more homogeneous inner regions.\nAt this point, the importance of gas clumping near the virial radius remains unclear.\nThe results from the Perseus cluster are clearly inconsistent with a homogeneous ICM\nin hydrostatic equilibrium, and clumping neatly explains the discrepancies between\nobservations and predictions in the thermodynamic gas profiles. Clumping at various\nscales is also predicted by numerical simulations [3, 4, 21]. Yet our initial results and\na recent Suzaku study of the fossil group RXJ 1159+5531 [22] are consistent with\nexpectations from a homogeneous ICM and need not invoke clumping. To what extent\nenvironment, observing location (e.g., along a filament), or instrumental effects might\nplay a role in these different results is an open question. Results from our full sample\nof clusters, as well as additional on-going studies of Perseus, Virgo, and other nearby\nbright clusters, will help solve this question.\n\n\fXMM\n\nSuzaku\n\nChandra\n\nAbell 2204\n\nFIGURE 3. Images of the southwest quadrant of Abell 2204 from XMM, Suzaku, and Chandra, showing\ndetected point sources from Suzaku (magenta circles) and Chandra (yellow circles). Other notations are\ndescribed in Figure 2. The resolving power of Chandra allows detection of an order of magnitude more\npoint sources than Suzaku, in an exposure one-eighth as deep. This depth allows tighter constraints on the\ncosmic background uncertainty, as discussed in the text and illustrated in Figure 4. The arrows indicate an\nexample bright point source, detectable by Chandra but not Suzaku, which dominates the uncertainty in\nthe outermost bin of Figure 4. Note that the very bright point source has very similar flux in each image,\nhowever due to the color scale and superior resolution it is less apparent in the Chandra image.\n\nFIGURE 4. Zoom-in of the Abell 2204 background-subtracted surface brightness profile from Figure\n2, showing only the outer three radial bins and with the ordinate plotted on a linear scale. The solid points\nhave error bars that include the uncertainty due to unresolved point sources below the Suzaku flux limit.\nThe open points include error down to the Chandra point source flux limit for the single Suzaku pointing\n(shown in Figure 3) with an overlapping Chandra snapshot. The uncertainty is lower by a factor of \u223c 3.\n\n\fFIGURE 5. RXCJ 0605 temperature and electron density profiles. The inlay is the 0.5\u20132 keV combined,\nexposure-corrected Suzaku/XIS image, with the same notations as in Figure 2.\n\nFIGURE 6. RXCJ 0605 entropy and fgas profiles. The S \u221d R1.1 relation is from Voit [2]. The shaded\nregions in the fgas plot show current estimates of the cosmic baryon fraction.\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank both the organizers and attendees of \"Suzaku 2011\" for a highly enlightening\nand enjoyable meeting.
