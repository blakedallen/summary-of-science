This suggests that\nthe ideas behind optimal economic growth in Von Neumann's model\ncan be helpful in uncovering functional organization principles of cell\nenergetics.\n\n1 Introduction\nIn the late 1930's John Von Neumann published (originally in German) a simple linear\nmodel to describe optimal economic growth [1,2]. Quite generally, he conceived a system in which N technologies can operate by combining M commodities. Technologies\nare distinguished by the amounts of goods they use as inputs and return as outputs.\nMoreover, they are linear (or constant returns to scale in economic jargon), in the\nsense that doubling the amount of inputs allows to double that of outputs (which\nimplies that, for instance, saturation effects are neglected). Crucially, the system is\nrequired to be self-sustained, so that all goods necessary for production at each period\nmust have been produced at the previous period. Given the input/output specifics of\nproduction processes, one poses the question of establishing which processes would\nbe operated and which would instead be kept inactive if the system has to maximize\nthe net production rate of commodities. It has been noted that Von Neumann, who\nhad been trained in chemistry and chemical engineering, might have been inspired\nby chemical reactors for such a construction [3]. In any case, his growth model has\nbecome a cornerstone of the theory of economic growth [4,5].\nVon Neumann's general idea can easily be transported to other contexts outside\neconomics, where input/output processes of various kinds are wired together to form a\nheterogeneous network [6,7,8]. A very notable example is found in cells. Metabolism,\nnamely the complex web of chemical reactions underlying energy transduction in\nliving organisms [9,10,11], becomes an ideal candidate to test Von Neumann's ideas\nonce the cross-membrane flow of matter is included in the above scheme. Given the\nfundamental nature of Von Neumann's assumptions, it is natural to ask to which\n\n\f2\n\nWill be inserted by the editor\n\ndegree the chemical activity of real cells can actually be described by an optimal\ngrowth (in the sense discussed above) framework.\nOn the other hand, the analysis of optimal growth in linear input/output systems\nis appealing for statistical physicists as well. As the system size increases, the optimal growth properties of 'random' input/output networks should hopefully become\nindependent of the particular input-output relationships. Rather, it should be possible to highlight a set of structural characteristics or constraints that are sufficient\nto frame optimal growth factors and activity profiles. Random input-output systems\nthen constitute a key benchmark against which one can evaluate the performances of\nsingle real instances, and the theory of spin glasses and neural networks provides the\ntechnical and conceptual tools for this type of analysis [12]. Indeed, their effectiveness to deal with linear problems close in spirit to Von Neumann's setup has been\ndemonstrated in various instances in the past (see e.g. the so-called knapsack problem\n[13,14] or even, more recently, the problem of general economic equilibrium [15]).\nOur goal here is, on one hand, to look back on the recent work concerned with\nthe statistical mechanics of Von Neumann's growth model for random input-output\nsystems. These studies have revealed a universal behaviour of the relevant quantities\nand allowed to highlight the key ingredients that can bring the basic framework closer\nto biologically important questions. Furthermore, we wish to discuss its application\nto cellular metabolism, which began more recently and is an ongoing and expanding\nchallenge. To complement previous studies, we shall present a broad analysis of the\nphysiological scenario underpinned by Von Neumann's model applied to the cellular\nmetabolism of the bacterium Escherichia coli. In our view, such studies demonstrate\nthat the basic postulate of optimal growth \u00e0 la Von Neumann might provide a useful\nkey to understand the organization of cell metabolism and energetics.\n\n2 Von Neumann's model\nThe basic setup of Von Neumann's growth model is as follows. One considers a system\nof N distinct processes (technologies, reactions) that are capable of operating on M\ncompounds (commodities, chemical species). The system is assumed to be closed, i.e.\nthere is no external supply of compounds to the system. In other terms, compounds\ncan only be produced from each other. Each process i is specified by a vector bi =\n{b\u03bci }, representing for each \u03bc = 1, . . . , M the amount of compound \u03bc process i uses as\ninput (the substrate), and by a vector ai = {a\u03bci }, representing for each \u03bc = 1, . . . , M\nthe amount of compound \u03bc process i outputs (the product). In the simplest case, it\nis assumed that a\u03bci , b\u03bci \u2265 0 for each i and \u03bc. For sakes of definiteness, each process\nshould have at least one input, whereas each compound should be the output of at\nleast one process. In turn, the input and output vectors form the columns of the\nM \u00d7 N input and output matrices, which we shall denote as B and A, respectively.\nProcesses are assumed to operate linearly, i.e. when run at scale si \u2265 0 they use\namounts si bi of inputs to produce si ai outputs. In this setup, the production side\n(its dual will be discussed later on) of Von Neumann's growth problem (also known\nas the 'technological expansion problem') is formulated in the following terms:\nmax ( \u03c1 ) ,\n\u03c1>0\n\nsubject to (A \u2212 \u03c1B)s \u2265 0\n\n(1)\n\nIn other words, one wants to find the largest \u03c1 > 0 (which we shall denote as \u03c1? ) such\nthat the system of inequalities\nc\u03bc \u2261\n\nN\nX\n(a\u03bci \u2212 \u03c1b\u03bci )si \u2265 0\ni=1\n\n\u2200\u03bc\n\n(2)\n\n\fWill be inserted by the editor\n\n3\n\nadmits a solution s = {si } with si \u2265 0 for all i (with the trivial solution si = 0 being\nruled out). The physical meaning of the above conditions becomes clear by noting\nthat the M -vector Bs (resp. As) encodes the total amount of each compound \u03bc used\nas input (resp. returned as output) by the various technologies. Hence for fixed \u03c1, a\nvector s satisfying (2) guarantees that for each compound the total output is at least\n\u03c1 times the total input. Maximizing \u03c1 then amounts to finding the largest growth factor sustainable by the system. Note that the growth factor is defined uniformly over\ncompounds, and one does not try to find an optimal vector of growth factors, one for\neach compound. In such a setting (which would make for an interesting generalization), the \u03c1? defined above would characterize the compounds forming the production\nbottlenecks, namely those with the smallest feasible growth factor.\nIn a discrete-time dynamical setup [16], one can imagine a scenario in which an\noperation scale is chosen for every technology at each time step t. Then the input\nvector I(t) \u2261 Bs(t) generates an output vector O(t) \u2261 As(t), part of which is recycled\ninto production (i.e. as the input at the next time step). The difference, namely\nC(t) = O(t) \u2212 I(t + 1)\n\n(3)\n\nis available e.g. for consumption or for other uses outside the production system\nstrictly defined, including as waste. This condition ensures to be focusing on selfsustaining production patterns. A minimal constraint to be imposed for stability\nis that C(t) \u2265 0, otherwise an external source of compounds would be needed to\novercome the input shortages at time step t + 1. In economics, a central issue at this\npoint is that of maximizing the discounted utility of the overall production over the\npossible time evolutions. A class of results known as 'turnpike theorems' [17] show\nthat optimal paths essentially coincide with the paths of maximal expansion described\nby Von Neumann's model. Therefore one may restrict to trajectories {s(t)} ensuring\nthat I(t + 1) = \u03c1I(t) with \u03c1 > 0 (i.e. such that I \u03bc (t) = I \u03bc (0)\u03c1t ). It is easily seen that\nsuch paths correspond, for operation scales, to s(t + 1) = \u03c1s(t), implying\nC(t) = \u03c1t (A \u2212 \u03c1B)s(0)\n\n(4)\n\nThe stability requirement C(t) \u2265 0 for all t immediately leads to consider the problem\n(2) and, in turn, (1). It is now clear that if the solution \u03c1? of (1) is larger than one\nthe system is expanding (i.e. trajectories are stationary states of constant growth at\na growth factor at least equal to \u03c1? ); if \u03c1? < 1 the system is instead contracting.\nNote that a linear combination \u03bbs+\u03bb0 s0 of two solutions s and s0 with non negative\ncoefficients \u03bb > 0 and \u03bb0 > 0 always satisfies the constraints, i.e. the solution space of\n(2) is convex. As \u03c1 increases (clearly, all vectors s are solutions for \u03c1 = 0) one expects\nits volume to shrink. As we shall see, a key question concerns the size of the solution\nspace that survives at \u03c1? .\nA classical and easy to prove result concerns the existence of \u03c1? [4]. Surely, if \u03c1\nis sufficiently small the system (2) is bound to admit a solution, i.e. it is possible to\nfind a \u03c1 > 0 for which As \u2265 \u03c1Bs. On the other hand, it is also possible to choose\n\u03c1 > 0 so large that the sum of the row entries of the matrix A \u2212 \u03c1B is negative for\neach row, which would imply the absence of a solution of (2). \u03c1? then coincides with\nthe least upper bound of the set of \u03c1's for which (2) admits a solution. Establishing\nthe value of \u03c1? is certainly the first task to be carried out. An equally important\nchallenge is however that of profiling the way in which processes are employed in\nstates of optimal growth. Because not all processes need to be operated, one expects\nthat some of them will actually be employed, whereas others will be shut down being\nunnecessary. Finally we shall focus on the characterization of the set of compounds\nthat will become available for consumption (if any).\n\n\f4\n\nWill be inserted by the editor\n\n3 Random input-output networks\nThe rationale for studying random input-output networks is simply that the macroscopic behaviour of a system of many interacting entities (technologies in Von Neumann's case) can be understood at the statistical level when the number of degrees of\nfreedom diverges. In this limit, in fact, the key macroscopic observables are expected\nto become substantially independent of the specific realization of the couplings [18].\nLarge systems with random couplings are therefore expected to be good approximations of non-random ones. In this sense, they also constitute a fundamental benchmark against which real systems should be compared. Luckily, a host of analytical\nand conceptual tools are available to deal with the statistical mechanics of systems\nwith random interactions of the type relevant for Von Neumann's problem [12,14].\n3.1 Fully connected networks\nThe fully connected Von Neumann model is defined by [16]\na\u03bci = a(1 + \u03b1i\u03bc )\n\n(5)\n\n\u03b2i\u03bc )\n\n(6)\n\nb\u03bci\n\n= b(1 +\n\nwhere a and b are constants (both > 0) whereas \u03b1i\u03bc and \u03b2i\u03bc are independent, identically\n2\n\ndistributed quenched Gaussian random variables of mean zero and variances (\u03b1i\u03bc )\nand (\u03b2i\u03bc )2 , respectively. In brief, processes in such a system employ every compound\nin a finite amount to produce every compound in a finite amount. The topology\nunderlying this problem is hence that of a fully connected bipartite graph. Inserting\nthe above definitions into (2) one arrives at the conditions\n(a \u2212 \u03c1b)\n\nN\nX\n\nsi +\n\ni=1\n\nN\nX\n\nsi (a\u03b1i\u03bc \u2212 \u03c1b\u03b2i\u03bc ) \u2265 0\n\n\u2200\u03bc\n\n(7)\n\ni=1\n\nBecause si \u221a> 0, for N \u001d 1 the first term dominates over the second term, which\nscales like N (assuming no correlations between si 's and the Gaussian disorder).\nTherefore, to leading order in N ,\n\u03c1? = a/b\n(8)\nThis tells us that the leading part of \u03c1? is independent of the details of the input/output vectors. Rather, it is determined only by the average input and output\ncoefficients. For sakes of simplicity, we shall henceforth set a = b = 1. To account for\nsubleading corrections, it is convenient to set\ng\n\u03c1=1+ \u221a\nN\n\u221a\n\nso that, for N \u001d 1, \u03c1 ' eg/\n(2) yields the conditions\nc\u03bc \u2261\n\nN\nX\n\nN\n\n(9)\n\nand g can be interpreted as a growth rate. In turn,\n\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\ng\ng\nsi \u03b1i\u03bc \u2212 1 + \u221a\n\u03b2i\u03bc \u2212 \u221a\n\u22650\nN\nN\ni=1\n\n\u2200\u03bc\n\n(10)\n\nOne is interested in studying the largest g for which (10) has solutions. The calculation, detailed in [16] follows standard steps of spin-glass-like systems (specifically, it\nis similar to a Gardner calculus [19]) and we limit ourselves to a brief sketch here.\n\n\fWill be inserted by the editor\n\n5\n\nThe solution space volume at fixed disorder and fixed g can be expressed as\n!\nN\nY\nX\nV (g) = Trs\n\u03b8(c\u03bc )\u03b4\nsi \u2212 N\n(11)\n\u03bc\n\ni=1\n\nPN\nwhere a hard constraint i=1 si = N has been included so as to remove the linear\ndegeneracy inherent in Von Neumann's problem (this is equivalent to setting a scale\nfor the si 's). The typical solution space volume Vtyp (g) ' exp(N v(g)) can be obtained\nfrom\n1\nlog V (g)\n(12)\nv(g) = lim\nN \u2192\u221e N\nwhere the over-bar denotes an average over the quenched disorder (5,6). The evaluation of the disorder average can be carried out resorting to the replica trick. The\nrelevant thermodynamic limit in this case is that where both N (number of processes)\nand M (number of compounds) diverge with a fixed ratio n = N/M . Here, after averages are computed, one can obtain an exact expression for v(g) via a saddle-point\nintegration and a replica-symmetric Ansatz. An interesting outcome of the above calculation is that \u03c1? (or more precisely g ? ) depends on the disorder statistics only via\nthe parameter\nk = (\u03b1i\u03bc \u2212 \u03b2i\u03bc )2\n(13)\n\u221a\nSpecifically, one obtains that g ? / k is a function of n only. This implies that, generically, larger growth rates require larger spread in the input/output coefficients, suggesting that optimization (and thus process selection) can be operated by choosing\nmaximally diversified technologies. It turns out that for g \u2192 g ? v(g) can be expressed in terms of the average Euclidean distance between solutions of (2) (denoted\nas \u03c7 \u2261 \u03c7(g)). In particular, one finds\nv(g) ' \u03c7\u03b3N\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is a positive exponent. Optimal growth (i.e. g \u2192 g ? ) can be retrieved in\nthe limit \u03c7 \u2192 0, in which case v(g) reduces to a single point (i.e. there is a a single\nconfiguration of operation scales that corresponds to an optimally growing system).\nThe resulting (n, g) phase diagram is shown in Fig. 1. In brief, g ? < 0 for n < 1,\nimplying that all viable configurations of operation scales are contracting. When\nn > 1, instead, expanding states become viable. The growth rate generically increases\nwith n. However the rate of increase changes drastically between the phase where\noptimal states are contracting to that where expansion is possible.

By contrast, when n is large technological\ninnovation appears to bear a much smaller effect on the growth properties. The saddle\npoint conditions also allow to derive a simple algebraic equation valid at g ? that relates\nthe fraction \u03c80 of inactive processes (i.e. processes such that si = 0) to the fraction \u03c60\nof compounds \u03bc such that c\u03bc = 0 (i.e. for which the overall output exactly matches\nthe overall input):\n\u03c80 = 1 \u2212 \u03c60 /n\n(16)\nIn different terms, (16) simply states that for g = g ?

Only for n > 1\ncan one obtain a feasible expanding state [16].\n\nshould equal the number of equalities (namely M \u03c60 ). Both \u03c80 and \u03c60 increase with\nn in a roughly sigmoidal way, with \u03c80 (n = 1) = \u03c60 (n = 1) = 1/2. In words, optimal\nstates in the contracting regime (n \u001c 1) are characterized by having almost all\nprocesses operated and almost all compounds available for consumption. In optimal\nexpanding states, instead (n \u001d 1), a small fraction of processes is profitable while\nalmost all compounds are perfectly recycled with limited production of consumable\ngoods or waste.\n3.2 Finitely connected networks\nA mathematically more compelling scenario is obtained when the topology underlying\nthe production networks is characterized by finite connectivity, i.e. when each process\nuses a finite number of compounds as substrates to produce a finite number of other\n(different) compounds [20]. This more realistic case can be conveniently dealt with by\nthe cavity method under the assumption that the bipartite graph that underlies the\nproduction network has a locally tree-like structure. In essence, cavity theories exploit\nthe fact that on such graphs the removal of a node of one type (either a compound or\na reaction) makes the nodes of the other types (reactions or compounds) that were\nlinked to the node we removed roughly statistically independent, since short loops\ncausing feedbacks and correlations are assumed to be absent (or anyway negligible).\nSo if we denote by si\u2208\u03bc the scale variables of processes connected to a compound \u03bc\nand by c\u03bc\u2208i the variables defined in (2) for compounds connected to a process i, then\ntheir probability distributions are such that\nY\nY\np(si\u2208\u03bc ) 6=\npi (si ) and q(c\u03bc\u2208i ) 6=\nq \u03bc (c\u03bc )\n(17)\ni\u2208\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\u2208i\n\nunless compound \u03bc or, respectively, process i are removed, in which case one has\nY (\u03bc)\nY \u03bc\np(\u03bc) (si\u2208\u03bc ) =\npi (si ) and q(i) (c\u03bc\u2208i ) =\nq(i) (c\u03bc )\n(18)\ni\u2208\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\u2208i\n\n\fWill be inserted by the editor\n\n7\n\nwhere the subscripts (i) and (\u03bc) indicate the removal of process node i and of com\u03bc\n(c\u03bc ) can be written explicitly as\npound \u03bc, respectively. Note however that q(i)\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\nY (\u03bc)\n\u03bc\n(c\u03bc ) = Trsj\u2208\u03bc\\i \u03b4 \uf8edc\u03bc \u2212\nsj (a\u03bcj \u2212 \u03c1b\u03bcj )\uf8f8\npj (sj )\n(19)\nq(i)\nj\u2208\u03bc\\i\n\nj\u2208\u03bc\\i\n\nwhere j \u2208 \u03bc \\ i indicates that the operations extend over all processes connected to \u03bc\nexcept i.

The\nnumerical procedure to extract \u03c1? from this setup is non-trivial and we refer the\nreader to [20] for details. The lesson one learns from this analysis is that the picture\nobtained in the fully connected case is rather robust to dilution. Finite connectivity\ndoes however bear a strong quantitative impact. In the contracting regime (\u03c1? < 1)\noptimal growth rates generically decrease with increasing dilution while the opposite\nhappens in expanding regimes with \u03c1? > 1. Moreover, optimal growth rates turn out\nto be consistently larger when processes have heterogeneous (as opposed to regular)\nconnectivities, independently of the degree distribution of compounds. Hence, generically dilution (in expanding regimes) and stochastic connectivities allow to achieve\nlarger growth rates with respect to the case of fully connected input/output systems.\nThe phase structure shown in Fig. 1 is however qualitatively preserved.\n3.3 Reversible networks\nAn important generalization considers processes as reversible, i.e. such that the roles\nof input and output coefficients can be interchanged [21]. This simple extra ingredient generates a surprisingly rich and considerably more complex scenario. Let us\nfirst notice that by allowing processes to revert Von Neumann's problem becomes\nintrinsically non-linear. Indeed it can be written compactly upon defining a matrix\nR with entries\n(\na\u03bci \u2212 \u03c1b\u03bci for si > 0\n\u03bc\nRi =\n(24)\nb\u03bci \u2212 \u03c1a\u03bci for si < 0\n\n\f8\n\nWill be inserted by the editor\n\nwhereby one sees that R \u2261 R(\u03c1, s). (The fact that process can be reverted is reflected\nalso in the possibility that si becomes negative.) Under this condition, (1) now reads\nmax \u03c1\n\u03c1>0\n\nsubject to R(\u03c1, s)s \u2265 0\n\n(25)\n\nThere are two basic properties of the reversible Von Neumann problem that are both\neasy to prove and rich of consequences. The first is that in general reversing all\nprocesses is not equivalent to time reversal, i.e. the naive expectation that if a scale\nvector s guarantees a growth factor \u03c1 then the reversed vector s0 should guarantee a\ngrowth factor \u03c10 = 1/\u03c1 turns out to be false. To see this, define\nc\u03bcd (s) =\n\nN\nX\n\nsi (a\u03bci \u2212 \u03c1b\u03bci )\n\n(26)\n\nsi (b\u03bci \u2212 \u03c10 a\u03bci )\n\n(27)\n\ni=1\n\nc\u03bcr (s) =\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\nand note that\nc\u03bcd (s)\n\n+\n\n\u03c1c\u03bcr (s)\n\n0\n\n= (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03c1 )\n\nN\nX\n\nsi a\u03bci\n\n(28)\n\ni=1\n\nClearly, c\u03bcd (s) = c\u03bcr (s) = 0 implies \u03c10 = 1/\u03c1 but if c\u03bcr (s) \u2265 0 then\nc\u03bc (s)\n\u03c1\u03c10 \u2264 1 \u2212 PNd\n\u03bc\ni=1 si ai\n\n(29)\n\nwhich tells us that c\u03bcd (s) = 0 for all \u03bc is a necessary but not sufficient condition for\n\u03c10 to be equal to 1/\u03c1. In general,\n!\nc\u03bcd (s)\n0\n\u03c1\u03c1 \u2264 min 1 \u2212 PN\n(30)\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\ni=1 si ai\nThe second notable fact is that the solution space ceases to be convex, in particular\nfor \u03c1 < 1. Re-writing (2) in this case as\n\u03bc\n\nc (s) =\n\nN\nX\n\nsi [a\u03bci (\u03b8(si ) + \u03c1\u03b8(\u2212si )) \u2212 b\u03bci (\u03b8(\u2212si ) + \u03c1\u03b8(si ))] \u2265 0\n\n\u2200\u03bc\n\n(31)\n\ni=1\n\none easily sees that\nc\u03bc (\u03bbs + \u03bb0 s0 ) = \u03bbc\u03bc (s) + \u03bb0 c\u03bc (s0 ) + A\u03bc (s, s0 )\n\n(32)\n\nwith\nA\u03bc (s, s0 ) = (1 \u2212 \u03c1)\n\nN\nX\n\n(a\u03bci + b\u03bci )[\u03bbsi \u03b8(\u2212si ) + \u03bb0 s0i \u03b8(\u2212s0i ) \u2212 (\u03bbsi + \u03bb0 s0i )\u03b8(\u2212\u03bbsi \u2212 \u03bb0 s0i )]\n\ni=1\n\n(33)\nIf s and s0 are both solutions, then a linear combination will again be a solution if\nA\u03bc \u2265 0. si s0i > 0 indeed implies A\u03bc = 0 for each \u03c1. However for si s0i < 0 one finds\nthat A\u03bc \u2265 0 only for \u03c1 \u2265 1. In other words convexity is guaranteed only for \u03c1 \u2265 1\nand may not occur even at \u03c1? when \u03c1? < 1.

The\ncontinuous (resp. dashed and dot-dashed) line is g ? / kn(1 + \u03c6) for \u03c6 = 0 (resp. \u03c6 = 1/2\nand \u03c6 = 1). Markers correspond to optimal growth rates estimated numerically as explained\nin [21]. (For clarity, the shaded region is only shown for \u03c6 = 0.) For n(1 + \u03c6) < 1 expanding\nstates are unfeasible. However one sees slight disagreements between the predicted (replicasymmetric) value of g ? and computed one.\n\nis obviously convex for \u03c1 = 0, showing that \u03c1 < 1 is a necessary but not sufficient\ncondition for the solution space to be non-convex (e.g. fragmented in disjoint parts).\nIt is very important to remark that non-convexity poses a serious problem for the\ndesign of efficient algorithms to sample the solution space in the contracting regime\n[21].\nThe statistical mechanics analysis of this case in a fully connected topology can\nproceed along steps similar to those performed for the random fully connected network, with (11) replaced by\nV (g) = Trs\n\nY\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03b8(c )\u03b4\n\nN\nX\n\n!\n|si | \u2212 N\n\n(34)\n\ni=1\n\nIf \u03c6 denotes the fraction of reversible processes (i.e. the effective number of processes\nthat can be operated in the system is N +N \u03c6), one finds an expanding phase with g ? >\n0 for n > nc \u2261 1/(1 + \u03c6) (see Figure 2). This suggests, as expected, that being able\nto run processes in both directions extends the range of the regime where expanding\nsolutions exist. The price to be paid is that optimal growth rates in the expanding\nregime are comparatively smaller when processes are reversible. For n(1 + \u03c6) < 1,\ninstead, the system is confined to a contracting regime. Here, larger \u03c6's imply larger\ngrowth rates, meaning that increasing the availability of reversible processes benefits\nthe system's growth properties. As seen above, however, the contracting phase is\ncharacterized by lack of convexity. This is hinted by the fact that the computed and\npredicted (replica-symmetric) values of g ? disagree (albeit just slightly) for n < nc\nwhen \u03c6 6= 0. To see this more explicitly one can measure directly the probability\nthat the uniform linear combination of two solutions solves Von Neumann's problem\n(Figure 3). Inspecting results, one sees immediately that the solution space displays\nmarks of convexity for sufficiently small g < g ? (recall that the solution space is\ncertainly convex for \u03c1 = 0).

Probability that the linear combination of two solutions with coefficients 1/2 solves\nthe fully reversible (\u03c6 = 1) random fully connected von Neumann problem for n = 1/2. The\nsolution space appears to lose convex values of g < g ? = 0. Different curves correspond to\ndifferent values of N increasing in the direction of the arrow from 50 to 500.\n\nconvexity appears to break down. The replica-symmetric theory one develops for this\ncase is thus expected to fail in a range of values of g < 0 (as seen in Fig 2).\nAs before, an increase in the optimal growth rate causes a decrease in the number\nof compounds with c\u03bc > 0. This corresponds to a 'waste' reduction and, on the\nother hand, to an impoverishment in the global output profile. Quite strikingly, the\nreversible part of the process set displays a neat second-order transition as n exceeds\nnc : all reversible processes are employed in the contracting phase, where a finite\nfraction of them is inactive when g ? > 0 [21].\n\n4 Towards metabolic networks\nVon Neumann's problem finds a natural ground of application in chemical reaction\nnetworks, in which the input-output relations linking technologies to goods in production systems are replaced by the wiring between reactions and chemical species\ngoverned by stoichiometry. Perhaps most importantly, in this context living cells\npresent us the opportunity to test Von Neumann's ideas directly in a real system,\nnamely their energy metabolism.\nIn cells, an enormous number of genetic, regulatory and biochemical mechanisms\ninteract on different spatial and temporal scales to accomplish a wide range of tasks,\nfrom growth and reproduction to motility, homeostasis and exterior sensing. The\nrapid development of high-throughput genome sequencing techniques together with\nthe availability of refined gene annotations has allowed, over the past few years, to set\nup consistent, controlled protocols for reconstructing the cellular metabolic networks\nof different organisms to an unprecedented degree of detail [9,22]. Such networks\nunderlie the basic energy harvesting processes in cells, by which the energy derived\nfrom nutrients is transduced into usable forms of mechanical or chemical energy. The\noutput of metabolism is constituted essentially by the so-called building blocks for\nfunctionally relevant biological macromolecules (amino-acids, fatty acids, nucleotides)\nas well as by waste products like e.g. carbon dioxide and acetate (mostly for bacteria).\nBuilding blocks are then used in a series of processes downstream of metabolism to\nform functional proteins (including reaction-catalying enzymes), membrane structures\nand nucleic acids. To a large degree, the physiological outcome of this can be read off\n\n\fWill be inserted by the editor\n\n11\n\nfrom the cell's proteome, i.e. from the composition of the repertoire of proteins that\nthe organism was able to produce, which in turn effects the regulation of metabolism.\nIt is immediately clear that, once the structure of the network (encoded in the\nreactions' stoichiometry) is known, Von Neumann's stability criterion can serve as a\nminimal model for the organization of metabolism. However, before discussing this\napplication more in detail (Sec. 5), it is worth trying to bring the theory a few steps\nforward (in a direction relevant to biology) by addressing a couple of peculiar aspects\nof biochemical reaction networks that, on one hand, have a direct influence on the\nsolutions of Von Neumann's problem and, on the other, generalize it. These are,\nrespectively, (a) the emergence of the so-called 'conserved pools of reagents', which\ntranslate into the need to consider constraints on the quenched disorder (the inputoutput coefficients), and (b) the highly important issue of thermodynamic stability.\n4.1 Stoichiometric quenched disorder\nIn first place, addressing optimality in reaction networks requires a more careful evaluation of the role of stoichiometry, since real networks are of course not random:\nstoichiometric coefficients enforce chemical balance at each reaction node in the network. This set of local relations has been shown to give rise, at a larger scale, to\nconservation laws for the aggregate concentration of pools of reagents [23]. Such laws\nare expressed by the relation\nX \u03bc\n(ai \u2212 b\u03bci ) = 0\n\u2200i\n(35)\n\u03bc\u2208P\n\nwhere P \u2286 {1, . . . M } is the set containing the chemical species that form the conserved pool. In concrete, the total number of molecules in a pool is conserved over\ntime, so that the aggregate concentration does not change in time (while the concentrations of individual metabolites can change relative to each other). These dynamical invariants have a purely topological origin in the structure of stoichiometric\ncoefficients. As a byproduct, one easily understands that metabolites belonging to\na conserved pool cannot be global network outputs (a detailed theory of this fact\nwith applications is developed in [24,25]). In other terms, in presence of a conserved\nmetabolite pool one expects that \u03c1? \u2264 1.\nA first step in driving Von Neumann's model towards real cellular networks consists therefore in studying how the existence of conserved metabolite pools affects\nthe picture derived in the case of random networks. The simplest way to implement\nthis ingredient is to impose a constraint on the quenched disorder. Specifically, one\ncan introduce a 'random' conserved pool formed by a finite fraction \u03c6 of reagents by\nexplicitly adding to the volume defined in (11) a hard constraint of the form\nM\nX\n\nz \u03bc (a\u03bci \u2212 b\u03bci ) = 0\n\n(36)\n\n\u03bc=1\n\n(where z \u03bc is a quenched random variable equal to one with probability \u000f and zero\notherwise). In order to check explicitly that the constraint (36) implies \u03c1? \u2264 1, i.e.\nthat at best optimal growth states are characterized by constant operation scales for\nreactions (fluxes), it suffices to multiply each term in (2) by z \u03bc and sum over \u03bc (we\nignore reversibility). One obtains:\n(1 \u2212 \u03c1)\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\nsi\n\nM\nX\n\u03bc=1\n\nz \u03bc b\u03bci +\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\nsi\n\nM\nX\n\u03bc=1\n\nz \u03bc (a\u03bci \u2212 b\u03bci ) \u2265 0\n\n(37)\n\n\f12\n\nWill be inserted by the editor\n\n2\n\nEXPANDING\ng*>0\n\n1.8\n\nSTATIONARY\ng*=0\n\n1.6\n\nn 1.4\n1.2\n\nCONTRACTING\ng*<0\n\n1\n0.8\n\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\n!\n\n1\n\nFig. 4. Phase structure of the random fully connected constrained Von Neumann model. The\ncontinuous line marks the separation between the regions with g ? = 0 (stationary regime)\nand g ? < 0 (contracting regime). The expanding regime lies on the \u000f = 0 axis (n > 1) and\nis represented by a green strip [26].\n\nIf the vector z identifies a conserved pool then the second term vanishes. The first\nterm allows for \u03c1 > 1 only if all reactions connected to metabolites in the conserved\npool are inactive (i.e. if the pool is effectively removed from the network). In particular\nthis leads to the trivial solution si = 0 for each i in a fully connected network. Hence\nnecessarily \u03c1? \u2264 1. So the states of expansion recovered in the previous sections are a\n'pathology' of random systems. When stoichiometric quenched disorder is used they\ncannot be present. Notice that this does not mean that the network cannot have a\npositive net production of compounds. The introduction of (36) slightly modifies the\ndisorder averaging but the replica theory developed for random input/output systems\ncan be conveniently extended to this constrained case [26]. The (\u000f, n) phase structure\none obtains, in agreement with the previous observations, is shown in Figure 4.\nA noteworthy consequence of the fact that \u03c1? cannot exceed 1 is that for large\nenough n, when an expanding phase would be expected in absence of the conserved\npool, multiple optima survive, i.e. the average distance between solutions does not\nvanish as g \u2192 g ? . So stoichiometric disorder appears to increase robustness in reaction\nnetworks, since many (microscopic) arrangements of reaction operation scales turn\nout to be compatible with optimal growth. It is interesting to note that real cellular\nmetabolic networks typically have values of n larger than one. This suggest that\nthe ability to respond to perturbations (e.g. by re-arranging scales) without losing\nthe desirable property of maximum productive capacity may be a key ingredient for\nbiological stability and resilience.\n4.2 Von Neumann's dual problem and thermodynamics\nThus far, we have limited ourselves to considering Von Neumann's problem in a production perspective. Our focus has been set on finding ways to operate the available\nprocesses that ensure self-sustainability and optimality. In his original work however\nJ. Von Neumann has given equal attention to the dual problem (in the sense of linear\nprogramming duality) [2]. In elementary economic terms, it can be introduced upon\ndefining an M -vector p of prices (p\u03bc \u2265 0 for each \u03bc). The cost associated to running\n\n\fWill be inserted by the editor\n\n13\n\nPM\na certain process i at unit scale is simply \u03bc=1 p\u03bc b\u03bci . This generates a corresponding\nPM\nrevenue given by \u03bc=1 p\u03bc a\u03bci . The problem dual to (1) consists in solving\nmin \u03c3\n\u03c3>0\n\nsubject to p(A \u2212 \u03c3B) \u2264 0\n\n(38)\n\n(compare this with (1)). The interpretation of the parameter \u03c3 is not straightforward.\nThe simplest is in terms of an interest factor. Imagining that the operation of processes\nis financed by borrowing cash at a rate r, at the end of each period \u03c3 = 1 + r units\nof cash must be returned to the financiers. In this setting, the conditions\nM\nX\n\np\u03bc (a\u03bci \u2212 \u03c3b\u03bci ) \u2264 0\n\n\u2200i\n\n(39)\n\n\u03bc=1\n\nsimply mean that the net extra profit generated by each process can at most be zero.\n(Zero profit is a standard scenario in models of economic equilibrium, see e.g. [27] or,\nin a statistical physics perspective, [28].)\nIt is simple to show that, in the above settings of (1) and (38) and under broad\nassumptions, \u03c1? \u2265 \u03c3 ? (with \u03c3 ? the solution of (38)) [4]. Furthermore, restricting\nslightly the definition of the model it can be proven that indeed \u03c1? = \u03c3 ? (i.e. that the\ngrowth factor equals the interest factor, as would perhaps be intuitively expectable).\nIt is however tempting to search for a physical interpretation of Von Neumann's\ndual problem. The simplest connection resides in the thermodynamic scenario underlying biochemical activity. It is well known that in non equilibrium steady states with\nnon-zero fluxes, reactions must proceed in directions of decreasing free energies (which\nin turn implies that thermodynamically feasible configurations of reaction fluxes may\nnot contain directed cycles) [29]. The condition for thermodynamic feasibility reads\nvi \u2206Gi \u2264 0\n\n\u2200i\n\n(40)\n\nwhere \u2206Gi is the (Gibbs) free energy change associated to reaction i and vi is the\nnet flux (the difference between the forward and reverse rates) of reaction i. \u2206Gi can\nbe written as the sum of the chemical potentials of the compounds weighted by their\nrespective stoichiometric coefficients. It then follows that thermodynamic feasibility\nis related to the existence of a chemical potential vector g such that\nvi\n\nM\nX\n\ng \u03bc (a\u03bci \u2212 b\u03bci ) \u2264 0\n\n\u2200i\n\n(41)\n\n\u03bc=1\n\nConnection to (39) is now straightforward. In this respect, prices play the role of\nchemical potentials and (39) have the form of a thermodynamic feasibility constraint.\nIt would be interesting to construct a more stringent physical analogy for (38).\nQuite recently an attempt in this direction has been performed in conjunction with\nFlux-Balance-Analysis (FBA) [9,30]. It was shown in specific that the dual to the\nlinear programming problem that arises in FBA can be re-formulated as a free energy consumption minimization problem conditioned on a given free energy drain\n(representing, in the case of cellular systems, growth) [31].\n\n5 Application to cellular metabolism\nModeling a cell's metabolic activity is a central problem in systems biology. In principle, knowledge of the network structure and of basic thermodynamic parameters\n\n\f14\n\nWill be inserted by the editor\n\nlike reaction constants allows to formulate non-linear differential equations for the\nenzyme-mediated joint evolution of reactant concentrations and reaction rates (or\nfluxes) that fully account for the kinetics of a biochemical reaction network [29]. Unfortunately at genome scale this route is most often barred by uncertainties about\nkinetic parameters and reaction or transport mechanisms. Constraint-based models\nof metabolism (like Flux-Balance Analysis [9,29,30,32]) provide a feasible alternative\nthat has marked a considerable breakthrough in the quest to reconstruct and simulate global cellular functions. In a nutshell, they rely on steady state assumptions\nto impose sets of physically motivated linear constraints (enforcing mass balance) on\nthe network nodes corresponding to reagents, and retrieve the viable flux states as\nthe configurations of reaction operation scales that ensure that all constraints are\nsatisfied. Regulatory and thermodynamic restrictions are included either in the allowed ranges of variability of fluxes or in the a priori reversibility assignments of\nreactions. Such a constrained linear system suffices to define a space of feasible flux\nconfigurations (whose characterization is in itself a challenging problem [33,34]). Quite\ncrucially, physiologically relevant states are usually assumed to maximize ad hoc objective functions that provide a further functional constraint on the cell's metabolic\nactivity (see e.g. [35,36,37,38] for some examples).\nApplying Von Neumann's idea to cellular metabolism amounts to taking a rather\ndifferent (though not unrelated) viewpoint. Recalling that in real stoichiometric systems \u03c1? = 1, finding optimal solutions in the Von Neumann sense means finding flux\nvectors s such that\nN\nX\nc\u03bc \u2261\n(a\u03bci \u2212 b\u03bci )si \u2265 0 \u2200\u03bc\n(42)\ni=1\n\nwhere the index i runs over reactions, \u03bc over chemical species and a\u03bci and b\u03bci denote\nthe output and input (respectively) stoichiometric coefficients of metabolite \u03bc in reaction i. As explained above, (42) encodes in essence a stability constraint. If fluxes\nthat transport matter (e.g. nutrients) into the cell are included in the stoichiometric\nmatrices to make the system self-sustainable (in such a way that the nutrient consumption equals its influx), then solving (42) allows to retrieve information about\nwhat the cell is in principle capable of net-producing in a given environment, as well\nas on the corresponding flux configurations. Metabolites for which c\u03bc = 0 indeed turn\nout to be mass-balanced, so that their production and consumption fluxes exactly\nmatch. On the contrary, if c\u03bc > 0 then metabolite \u03bc is globally producible, meaning\nthat it can become available either for macromolecular processes or as waste. The\navailability of a neural network learning-based algorithm for the efficient generation\nof solutions of (42) (see [20], based on [39]) then permits a detailed statistical analysis\nof the cell's metabolic capabilities.\nWork performed along these lines for the bacterium Escherichia coli [40,41] has\nshown that environment selection restricts the feasible states according to (42) to flux\nconfigurations that both reproduce well the available empirical evidence on E.coli's\nmetabolic fluxes and guarantee that the correct physiological task (in that case,\ngrowth or biomass production) is carried out by the cell without the need of additional ad hoc functional constraints. We want to add here further evidence supporting\nthe relevance of Von Neumann's observations in the context of cell metabolism.\nWe have computed and analyzed optimal flux configurations (in Von Neumann's\nsense) for the Escherichia coli metabolic network reconstructed in [43], preparing it\nin a minimal growth medium with gluxose as its main carbon source. At odds with\nthe work presented in [40,41], we have modified the model to be able to measure\nthe levels of some of the physiological objective functions used in the computational\nbiology literature (see e.g. [38]). Our goal is to characterize the solution space defined\n\n\fWill be inserted by the editor\n\n15\n\nprod. profiles overlap\n\n0.25\n\n0.15\n\nP(s)\n\nP(q)\n\n0.2\n\nflux overlap\n\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nq\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\ns\n\nFig. 5.

For each reaction i, we define\n\uf8f1\nfor si\u03b1 < \u000f and si\u03b2 < \u000f\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f41\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f21 \u2212 si\u03b1 if \u000f < si\u03b1 < 1 and si\u03b2 < \u000f\nq\u03b1\u03b2 (i) =\n(43)\nif si\u03b1 \u2265 1 and si\u03b2 < \u000f\n\uf8f40\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n2s\ns\n\uf8f3 2 i\u03b1 i\u03b2\notherwise\ns +s2\ni\u03b1\n\ni\u03b2\n\nwhere \u000f is a cut-off value below which we treat fluxes as zero (results do not depend\non the choice of the cut-off as long as \u000f is 10\u22125 or less). This parameter measures in\nessence the variation of flux i in solutions \u03b1 and \u03b2. For a complete flux configuration,\nwe define\n1 X\nq\u03b1\u03b2 =\nq\u03b1\u03b2 (i)\n(44)\nN i\nas a characterization of the \"distance\" between solutions \u03b1 and \u03b2: the closer q is to 1\n(resp. 0) the more similar (resp. dissimilar) the two configurations are. Likewise, we\ndefine the overlap between the vectors c that correspond to the production profiles in\neach solution of (42). The distributions of these overlaps are displayed in Figure 5. One\nsees that the distance between solutions has a broader distribution than that between\nproduction profiles, indicating that a degree of flexibility in the flux organization is\nallowed that nevertheless ensure a remarkable robustness in the emerging production\nprofile. The finding of [41] that indeed the most probable output of the network is\nformed by the biomass constituents [44] is hereby fully confirmed (data now shown),\nas is the fact that the distribution of fluxes (see Figure 5) retains the empirically\nobserved [45] power-law shape with exponent \u22121. Single solutions however display a\ncertain degree of variability, as can be seen again in Figure 5.\nLet us now analyze how this scenario reflects in the values of some of the recurrent physiological objective functions used in the literature (see Figure 6).

Plots (1) and\n(2) display the flux pertaining to a biomass production reaction computed in a network reconstruction where such a reaction was explicitly included. This flux represents an addition\nover the biomass that the network spontaneously yields: (1) bare extra biomass flux; (2)\nbare extra biomass flux per flux unit. Flux units are arbitrary.\n\nhave monitored in particular: the total production of ATP (adenosine-triphosphate,\nthe key molecular energy carrier in cells), the total consumption of NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, the key reducing agent in electron transfer processes in\nmetabolism, with several other important functional roles at different levels in cells),\nthe total net flux (which is assumed to be a good proxy for enzymatic efficiency)\nand the glucose (GLC) uptake (measuring nutrient consumption). ATP production,\nNADH consumption and total net flux display a roughly unimodal shape, pointing to\nthe fact that under Von Neumann's hypothesis the network is capable of tuning these\nfunctions within a relatively small range of values. Notice that the total flux is usually\nassumed to be minimized by cells, to account for optimal use of the available pool of\nenzymes. On the other hand, it is reasonable to think that cells under certain conditions maximize the ATP yield for optimal energetic efficiency. A similar picture holds\nfor the ATP yield per flux unit, which is usually assumed to be maximized so as to\nguarantee optimal energetic efficiency at minimum enzyme usage. NADH consumption is instead thought to be minimized, to reduce the activity of redox processes.\nGLC consumptions displays instead a somewhat broader profile. This is consistent\nwith previous results [41] and points to the fact that the emerging physiologic scenario\n(which appears to be robust from the energetic and enzymatic efficiency viewpoints) is\n\n\fWill be inserted by the editor\n\n17\n\nATP yield per unit flux\n\n0.09\n0.08\n0.07\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\nBiomass flux\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n\nATP yield\n\n0.1\n\n0.06\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n0.5\nBiomass Flux\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nFig. 7.

In other words, glucose\navailability can fluctuate within a broad range without affecting optimality in the Von\nNeumann sense. This however does have an effect on other physiological observables\nlike the ATP production or the consumption of NADH per unit of GLC consumed.\nThese functions turn out to be broadly distributed as well, although with well defined\npeaks at low values. Finally, we have considered the effect of adding explicitly the\nbiomass production reaction to the pool of processes encoded in the network reconstruction. Recalling that the system globally outputs biomass constituents even in\nabsence of this additional reaction, Figure 6 shows that the extra biomass flux due to\nthe inclusion of the additional process is essentially null. In other words, the unforced\nbiomass output of (42) by itself fully describes the cell's production capacity in the\nenvironment we selected. In summary, the physiological scenario emerging from Von\nNeumann's model applied to Escherichia coli's metabolism is one in which the variability of optimal flux configurations underlies considerable robustness at the level of\nproduction profiles as well as at the level of key metabolic functions, the main exception being glucose consumption, which instead is allowed to fluctuate over a large\nrelative range. The latter aspect contributes to robustness as well.\nTo conclude, we have investigated the problem of if and how forcing an extra\nbiomass flux from the cell (i.e. forcing a non-zero value for the flux of the biomass\nreaction) changes the physiological scenario with respect to the reference case in which\nthe biomass output is obtained self-consistently from the solutions of (42). Figure 7\nshows how the bare ATP yield and the ATP yield per flux unit (two elementary\nparameters to quantify the physiological state of the cell) change upon increasing\nthe extra biomass flux. In first place, as should be expected, the bare ATP yield\nslowly increases initially as a non-zero additional biomass flux is forced, but its value\ntends to saturate as the latter increases, indicating that the system has reached a\nmaximal ATP output capacity. The relative gain in ATP yield with respect to the\nunforced reference state is close to 30%. At the same time, however, the ATP yield\n\n\f18\n\nWill be inserted by the editor\n\nper flux unit, which as said above quantifies energetic efficiency against enzyme usage,\nis actually reduced as the biomass flux increases, meaning that the cell can achieve\nlarger biomass outputs and a gain in bare ATP yield only at the cost of a dramatic\ndecrease in the overall metabolic efficiency (the relative loss being close to 50%). Quite\nsignificantly, then, optimal states from the physiological viewpoint appear to be those\ndefined by (42) without any additional constraint. Similarly (data not shown) NADH\nconsumption increases upon increasing the forced biomass flux while, by contrast,\nGLC consumption roughly stays constant until the extra biomass flux reaches the\nvalue 0.5, when it starts increasing dramatically.\nThese results suggest that Von Neumann's optimal states are on one hand able\nto provide a description of the metabolic activity of bacterial cells that is in good\nagreement with the empirical knowledge; on the other, they frame key physiological\nobservables in contained ranges (implying robustness) so that forcing an improvement\nin the growth capacity leads to a decrease in metabolic efficiency, thereby pointing to a\ndirect biological counterpart of Von Neumann's economic optimality. Clearly however,\nfurther work is needed in order to clarify the extent to which Von Neumann's model\nmight be applicable in the context of metabolic networks, and above all for more\ncomplex cell types (like yeast or human cells), where regulation and kinetics may\nplay more important roles and steady state models might turn out to be insufficient\nto identify the emerging physiological characteristics with a good degree of confidence.\n\n6 Conclusions\nVon Neumann's linear growth model addresses the very general problem of characterizing a self-sustained network of interacting input-output processes in terms of (a) the\nmaximum achievable growth rate, (b) the pattern of activity of processes and (c) the\nemergent net production profile. Despite its remarkably simple rationale, this setup\nmakes for a challenging and easily generalizable statistical mechanics problem that\ngives rise to a rich phenomenology which can be studied both analytically (for ensembles of random networks) and numerically (for single instances). The theory described\nhere covers in our view only the simpler and more straightforward modifications of\nthe original model, all guided by a chemical rather than economical intuition. From a\nstrictly theoretical viewpoint (but possibly also with direct relevance for many applications) it would be interesting to bring them farther beyond Von Neumann's original\ndefinition, e.g. by relaxing or abandoning the assumption of constant returns to scale.\nPerhaps the most notable application of these ideas outside of economics (where they\nwere originally conceived and where they form a basis for the theory of economic\ngrowth) can be located in cellular metabolism. Applying Von Neumann's growth\nmodel to cell metabolism, in our view, corresponds to appraising to what extent and\nin what manner do environmental, stiochiometric and thermodynamic factors limit\nand determine the output of a cell's biochemical machinery within a minimal physical\nassumption of stability. The quantitative analysis of intracellular chemical reaction\nnetworks performed along these lines has provided a physiologically sensible characterization of the metabolic capabilities of the bacterium Escherichia coli (as well as\nof other, simpler cell types [42]) in agreement with empirical evidence. This suggests\nthat the function of the biochemical core of the energetics of cellular systems mirrors at least to some extent the basic notions of stability and optimality that are\nencoded in Von Neumann's model and possibly underlie optimal economic growth.\nUnderstanding how this picture is affected by the cross-talk between metabolism and\nregulation, which could be the major source of non-linearity, is perhaps the most\nobvious next step.\n\n\fWill be inserted by the editor\n\n19\n\nAcknowledgments.
