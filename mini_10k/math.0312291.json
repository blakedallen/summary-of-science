By Poincar\u00e9's recurrence Theorem, \u03bc-almost every point x \u2208 A comes back infinitely many times in\nA upon iterations of f . We denote by rnA (x), n \u2265 1, the time of the nth return\nof x \u2208 A to A. These times are defined by induction in the following way :\nr1A (x)\n\ndef\n\nrn+1\nA (x)\n\ndef\n\n=\n\n=\n\nmin{k \u2265 1, f k (x) \u2208 A},\nn\n\nrnA (x) + r1A (f rA (x) (x)).\n\ndef\n\n0\n(For convenience we set rA\n= 0.) Assuming that \u03bc is ergodic, the well-known\nKa\u010d\n's\nformula\n(virtually\nfound\nin any textbook on ergodic theory) tells that\nR 1\nrA d\u03bc = 1. We can also introduce the Poincar\u00e9 cycles of A with respect to\nPn\ndef\n\u2212 rnA , n \u2265 0. We obviously have rnA = j=1 \u03c4Aj .\nx \u2208 A by setting \u03c4An+1 = rn+1\nA\nIn a note [2], Birkhoff showed that\n\nrnA (x)\n1\n=\nn\u2192+\u221e\nn\n\u03bc(A)\nlim\n\nfor \u03bc \u2212 almost every x \u2208 A .\n\n(1)\n\nThis note was so overshadowed by his subsequent proof of the Ergodic Theorem\nfor any integrable function that it escaped notice. The 'modern' proof of (1)\ncan be found for instance in [16, 18] (where Birkhoff's note is not cited) and it\nis a simple consequence of the Ergodic Theorem.\nIt is natural to study the fluctuations of the convergence in (1). We can\nfirst ask for large deviations (that is of order O(1)) of this Birkhoff average of\nPoincar\u00e9\n\u221a cycles. One can also asks for log-normal fluctuations (that is of order\nO(1/ n)). As far as we know, such questions have never been investigated. It is\neasy to check that the random variables \u03c4An are stationary under the conditional\ndef\nprobability measure \u03bcA = \u03bc(* \u2229 A)/\u03bc(A). The corresponding process inherits\nergodicity from ergodicity of (X, f, \u03bc). Set in the language of dynamical systems,\n1\nthis means that the induced system (A, f \u03c4A , \u03bcA ) is an ergodic dynamical system\n[5]. The \u03c4An 's are generally not independent. Let us mention a notable exception:\nWhen A is a state of a countable state Markov chain. A dynamical realisation of\nsuch a process is given by the so-called Gaspard-Wang map, a piece-wise linear\napproximation of the Manneville-Pomeau map, see e.g. [11].\nThe aim of the present article is to prove an accurate large deviation principle\nand a central limit theorem for rnA /n when f is an Axiom-A diffeomorphism on\na Riemannian manifold M , and \u03bc is the equilibrium state associated to a H\u00f6lder\ncontinuous potential \u03c6. The visited set A will be a Markov rectangle of some\nbasic set (or a finite union of Markov rectangles).\nThere are a lot of recent works on return times. In most of them, \"rare\nevents\" are considered, that is sets An such that \u03bc(An ) goes to zero as n tends\nto infinity. Typically, An is a cylinder set and one looks at the rescaled return\ntimes to An . In many dynamical systems with \"sufficiently strong\" mixing\nproperties, such rescaled returns are shown to be distributed according to a\n2\n\n\fPoisson law as n goes to infinity (see [1] for a recent but not up-to-date review).\nFor a fixed set, the moments of hitting and return times are studied in [7] in the\nsetting of 'strongly mixing' processes. We would like to emphasize that in the\npresent work the asymptotics are taken with respect to the number of visits to\nsome fixed set A.\nOur key-result (Theorem 2.1) is the existence of a kind of \"free energy\" for\nPoincar\u00e9 cycles. In probabilistic terms, we prove the existence of the scaledgenerating cumulant function associated to rnA . We are able to analyse the\nproperties of this function because we show it is nothing but the logarithm of the\nlargest eingenvalue of some one-parameter family of transfer operators. These\ntransfer operators act on the induced system on an unstable leaf of reference\ncrossing the set A upon consideration. This construction was done in [17] for\nother purposes than studying return times (namely to construct equilibrium\nstates). Once we have this free energy for Poincar\u00e9 cycles and its properties, we\napply two results (that are little used) to get precise large deviation estimates\nand a central limit theorem for Birkhoff averages of Poincar\u00e9 cycles. At a more\ntechnical level, let us notice that since return times are not continuous functions,\nwe cannot apply the so-called contraction principle of large deviation theory [12]\nto the empirical measure. We can neither (directly) apply the known central\nlimit asymptotics which are established for Lipschitz continuous functions (see\n[23] and references therein).\nOutline of the article. In Section 2, we state our main result and its consequences. Section 3 is devoted to some preparatory notions and lemmas. The\nproof of the main result is given in Section 4. We first handle the case when A\nis a single Markov rectangle. We then show how to extend the result to a finite\nunion of rectangles. In Section 5 we derive our large deviation and central limit\ntheorems.\n\n2\n\nStatement of results\n\nWe refer the reader to the book of Bowen (see [3]) for the precise definitions of\nAxiom-A diffeomorphisms, equilibrium states and basic sets.\nAssumptions. Throughout we assume that f is a C 2 Axiom-A diffeomorphism on a compact Riemannian manifold M . Let \u03a9 be a basic set for f and\n\u03c6 : M \u2192 R be a H\u00f6lder continuous function. We denote by \u03bc the (unique) equilibrium state associated to \u03c6 on \u03a9. Finally, R = {Ri } denotes a finite Markov\npartition of \u03a9 (into more than one rectangle). Let A ( \u03a9 be some finite union\nof atoms of the partition R.\nThe main result that we are going to prove is the following :\nTheorem 2.1. Under the above assumptions, there exists a real number \u03b10 =\n\u03b10 (A) > 0 such that for every \u03b1 < \u03b10 ,\nh ni\n1\ndef\nlog IE\u03bcA e\u03b1rA < +\u221e .\n\u03a8(\u03b1) = lim\nn\u2192+\u221e n\n3\n\n\fMoreover the map \u03b1 7\u2192 \u03a8(\u03b1) has the following properties:\n1. The map z 7\u2192 \u03a8(z) is analytic in a complex neighborhood of ] \u2212 \u221e, \u03b10 [.\n2. It is strictly convex on ] \u2212 \u221e, \u03b10 [.\nWe shall apply this theorem and a result due to Plachky and Steinebach [20]\nto get precise estimates on large fluctuations on Birkhoff averages of Poincar\u00e9\ncycles.\nTheorem 2.2 (Large deviations). Under the above assumptions, we have\nthe following estimates, for every u \u2208 (0, \u221e)\n\u001a n\n\u001a \u0012\n\u001b\n\u0013\n\u001b\n1\nrA\n1\n1\nlim\nlog \u03bcA\n\u2265\n+ u = inf \u2212\n+ u \u03b1 + \u03a8(\u03b1)\nn\u2192\u221e n\n\u03b1<\u03b10\nn\n\u03bc(A)\n\u03bc(A)\nand for every 0 < u < 1/\u03bc(A)\n\u001a n\n\u001a \u0012\n\u001b\n\u0013\n\u001b\nrA\n1\n1\n1\nlog \u03bcA\n\u2264\n\u2212 u = inf \u2212\n\u2212 u \u03b1 + \u03a8(\u03b1)\nlim\n\u03b1<\u03b10\nn\u2192\u221e n\nn\n\u03bc(A)\n\u03bc(A)\nwhere \u03b10 > 0 is the same as in Theorem 2.1.\nOf course we can replace the nth return time, rnA , by the Birkhoff sum of\nPn\nPoincar\u00e9 cycles, j=1 \u03c4Aj , in the previous theorem.\nWe also obtain a central limit theorem by using Theorem 2.1 and applying a\nresult due to Bryc [6]. Notice that in general it is impossible to deduce a central\nlimit theorem from a large deviation principle assuming only that the cumulant\ngenerating function is twice differentiable at the origin. Even real-analyticity is\nnot enough (see a counterexample in [6]).\nTheorem 2.3 (Central limit theorem).

We emphasize that in Theorem 2.2 we have limits, not just liminf and\nlimsup. We could of course formulate the result in terms the Legendre\ntransform of \u03a8. We could also consider more general intervals of large\ndeviations in the spirit of the G\u00e4rtner-Ellis Theorem [12].\n3. It is well-known that the values assumed by \u03a8\u2032 when \u03b1 ranges from \u2212\u221e to\n\u03b10 give the values of the possible deviations u around the mean 1/\u03bc(A).\nIt will be easy to check that \u03a8\u2032 (\u03b1) runs from 0 to +\u221e. The fact that\nfluctuations above 1/\u03bc(A) can be arbitrary large is due to the fact that\nthere are points which are typical for (invariant) measures giving arbitrary\n1\nsmall weight to A. Notice that \u03a8\u2032 (0) = limn\u2192+\u221e n1 IE\u03bcA [rnA ] = \u03bc(A)\n.\nIndeed,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nn\nn\nX\n1\n1X\n1\nIE\u03bcA (\u03c4Aj ) = IE\u03bcA (\u03c4A1 ) =\n\u03c4Aj \uf8f8 =\nIE\u03bcA \uf8ed\n.\nn\nn j=1\n\u03bc(A)\nj=1\nThe last equality is Ka\u010d formula and the fact that IE\u03bcA (\u03c4Aj ) = IE\u03bcA (\u03c4A1 )\nfor all j \u2208 N is established in [16] or [18].\n4. There is another way to prove a central limit theorem close to Theorem\n2.3. Let us sketch it when A is a single rectangle. There is a well-known\nduality between the nth return to A and the number of occurrences of\ndef\nA up to time n. Let NAn (x) = 1IA (x) + * * * + 1IA (f n\u22121 x). This is the\nnumber of visits of the orbits of x to A up to time n. A central limit\ntheorem can be easily derived for NAn by using [19]. Indeed, we can apply\nthe central limit theorem given therein to the characteristic function of\nthe one-cylinder associated to A in the subshift (\u03a3, \u03c3) and pull it back to\n(\u03a9, f ).

Applying Feller's result [13] we get (2) with\n2\n\u03c3 2A = \u03c3A\n\u03bc(A)3 .\n\n(4)\n\n2\nThus, proving that \u03c3A\n> 0 is equivalent to prove that \u03c3 2A > 0 since A\nis a (non-trivial) Markov rectangle, that is, 0 < \u03bc(A) < 1. But by [19]\n\n5\n\n\fwe know that \u03c3 2A = 0 if, and only if, 1IA \u2212 \u03bc(A) is a coboundary. This\ncannot happen for a Markov rectangle because this would imply that for\nany fixed point x \u2208 A, 1 = 1IA (x) = \u03bc(A) < 1. Notice that by following\n2\nthis line of proof, we do not prove that \u03c3A\nis equal to \u03a8\u2032 (0).\n\n3\n\nPreparatory lemmas\n\nIn this section, we briefly recall the relevant results from [17] which are useful\nfor the proof of Theorem 2.1 and derive a few lemmas.\n\n3.1\n\nNotations\n\nLet us recall that \u03bc is the unique equilibrium state associated to the potential\n\u03c6, that is, we have\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nZ\nh\u03bc (f ) + \u03c6 d\u03bc = sup h\u03bd (f ) + \u03c6 d\u03bd = Ptop (\u03c6, \u03a9)\n(5)\n\u03bd\n\nwhere the supremum is taken over the set of f -invariant probability measures\non \u03a9. As usual, h\u03bd (f ) denotes the entropy of the measure \u03bd and Ptop (\u03c6, \u03a9)\nthe topological pressure on \u03a9 associated to the potential \u03c6. Let N \u2265 2 be\nthe number of proper rectangles of the Markov partition R and A the N \u00d7N transition matrix defined as\naij = 1\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e6\n\nif f \u22121 (Rj )\u2229 Ri 6= \u2205\naij = 0 otherwise.\n\nLet \u03a3 be the set of sequences x = {xn }n\u2208Z such that for every n, xn belongs to\n{1, . . . , N } and axn xn+1 = 1. If \u03c3 denotes the shift map on \u03a3, there exists some\ncanonical map \u03c0 from \u03a3 onto \u03a9 such that the following diagram commutes:\n\u03a3\n\u03c0\u2193\n\u03a9\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u2212\u2192 \u03a3\n\" \u2193\u03c0\nf\n\n\u2212\u2192 \u03a9\n\nAs the map \u03c0 is also H\u00f6lder continuous, the map \u03c6\ne defined by\ndef\n\n\u03c6\ne = \u03c6\u25e6\u03c0\n\nis again H\u00f6lder continuous, and there exists a unique equilibrium state \u03bc\ne for the\ndynamical system (\u03a3, \u03c3) associated to the potential \u03c6.\ne Moreover \u03bc\ne \u25e6 \u03c0 \u22121 = \u03bc.\nThe topological pressure associated to \u03c6,\ne Ptop (\u03c6,\ne \u03c3), is equal to Ptop (\u03c6, \u03a9).\nThe cylinder set [i0 , . . . , in ] \u2282 \u03a3, ij \u2208 {1, ..., N }, n \u2265 0, is the set of points x\nsuch that xj = ij (for every 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n).\nLet g be the first return map in A:\ng:A\nx\n\n\u2212\u2192 A\n\n1\n\n7\u2212\u2192 f rA (x) (x).\n6\n\n\fu\ns\nIf x is a point in \u03a9, we denote, as usually, by W u (x), Wloc\n(x), W s (x), Wloc\n(x)\nthe unstable and stable global and local manifolds. Local means that the length\nis equal to some expansive constant, \u03b50 . For every set R of small diameter\n(smaller than \u03b50 ) we set\ndef\n\ni\nW i (x, R) = Wloc\n(x) \u2229 R, for i = u, s.\n\nWe will assume that the diameter of R is smaller than \u03b50 .\n\n3.2\n\nThe subsystem (F, gF )\n\nFor the sake of definiteness, we set A = \u03c0[1]. We denote by F some fixed\nunstable leaf in A; namely we have\nF = W u (x0 , A)\n\u25e6\n\nfor some fixed point x0 in A. The system of local coordinates gives a projection\n\u03c0F from A onto F . This projection is H\u00f6lder continuous. We denote by gF the\nmap \u03c0F \u25e6 g. For x in \u03a9 and x\u2032 in W s (x), we set\n\u03c9(x, x\u2032 ) =\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nk=0\n\n\u03c6 \u25e6 f k (x) \u2212 \u03c6 \u25e6 f k (x\u2032 ) .\n\nThe map \u03c6 is H\u00f6lder continuous, and so, by contraction on the stable leaves,\nthe previous series converges. For x in F we set \u03c9(x) = \u03c9(g(x), gF (x)), and\nr1A (x)\u22121\n\n\u03a6(x) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c6 \u25e6 f k (x) + \u03c9(x) .\n\nk=0\n\nThis function is defined on a set of full measure with respect to any invariant\nmeasure. A simple computation gives the following lemma\nLemma 3.1. There exists some positive constant C\u03c9 such that for every x in\nF,\nk\u03c9k\u221e \u2264 C\u03c9 .\nThe inverses branches of gF define the family of n-cylinders: for x in F we\nset\ndef\n\nn\n\nCn (x) = f \u2212rA (x) (W u (g n (x), A)).\nThe n-cylinders are well-defined except for the points in F which do not return\ninfinitely many times in R and for the points which belong to the orbit of the\nboundary \u2202R of the partition. These two sets of points will have null-measure\nfor all the measures we are going to consider. Hence, every n-cylinder is a\ncompact set and the collection of the n-cylinders defines a partition of F (up to\nthe boundary and points which come back less than n times), which refines the\npartition into (n \u2212 1)-cylinders. An important property is that gFn (Cn (x)) = F\n7\n\n\ffor every n-cylinder. This is a consequence of the Markov property of the\npartition. This allows us to define the set of preimages of some point x in F by\ngFn , denoted by P ren (x). Hence, every n-cylinder contains exactly one element\nof P ren (x), for every x in F . We define the Perron-Frobenius-Ruelle operator\nfor any x\nX\n1\ne\u03a6(y)\u2212rA (y)S T (y)\nLS (T )(x) =\ny\u2208P re1 (x)\n\nwhere S is a real parameter. It is proved in [17] that there exists a critical value\nSc , with Sc \u2264 Ptop (\u03c6, \u03a9), such that\nLS (1IF )(x) < +\u221e for every S > Sc and for every x \u2208 F .\n\n(6)\n\nSc is of course defined as the smallest real number with this property. It is also\nproved that for every x in F and for S = Ptop (\u03c6, \u03a9), we still have LS (1IF )(x) <\n+\u221e. A part of the work in the next subsection will be to prove that in fact\nSc is strictly smaller than the topological pressure Ptop (\u03c6, \u03a9) and indeed equal\nto the topological pressure when one removes transitions from or to A. Here\nagain, the Markov property of the partition and the hyperbolic structure lead\nto the next lemma:\nLemma 3.2. There exists a positive constant C\u03c6 which does not depend on S\nsuch that for all x, y \u2208 F , S > Sc and integer n\n1 n\nL (1IF )(x) \u2264 LnS (1IF )(y) \u2264 C\u03c6 LnS (1IF )(x).\nC\u03c6 S\nThere exists some quasi-metric \u03b7 on F such that for every S > Sc , the\noperator LS is a quasi-compact operator on the Banach space C\u03b7 of Lipschitzcontinuous function (for the quasi-metric \u03b7). We recall that the norm k * k\u03b7 on\nC\u03b7 is defined by\n|\u03c6(x) \u2212 \u03c6(x\u2032 )|\n.\nk\u03c6k\u03b7 = k\u03c6k\u221e + sup\n\u03b7(x, x\u2032 )\nx6=x\u2032\nThe quasi-metric \u03b7 is chosen such that the \u03b8-H\u00f6lder continuous functions on\nF (where \u03b8 is the H\u00f6lder coefficient of \u03c6) are \u03b7-Lipschitz continuous functions.\nUsing the Ionescu-Tulcea & Marinescu theorem (see [15]), we get that there\nexists some unique probability measure mS such that\nL\u2217S (mS ) = \u03bbS mS\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03bbS > 0. Moreover, there is a unique function HS in C\u03b7 such that\nZ\nLS HS = \u03bbS HS and\nHS dms = 1.\nThis function satisfies\n\n1\n\u2264 HS \u2264 C0\nC0\n8\n\n(8)\n\n\fwhere C0 > 0. A consequence of Lemma 3.2 is that C0 does not depend on S.\nThe measure \u03bdS defined by\nd\u03bdS = HS dmS\nis the unique equilibrium state for (F, gF ) associated to \u03a6(*) \u2212 Sr1A (*). Quasicompactness of LS means here that there exist p = p(S) complex numbers of\nmodulus one, 1 = \u03bb(1), . . . , \u03bb(p) such that\nLS =\n\np\nX\ni=1\n\ne\n\u03bbS \u03bb(i)\u03a8i + \u03bbS \u03a8\n\n(9)\n\ne has a spectral\nwhere the \u03a8i are linear projectors defined on C\u03b7 with finite rank, \u03a8\nradius strictly smaller than 1, and all the kernels of these operators contain the\nimages of the others.\nA crucial fact is that for S = Ptop (\u03c6, \u03a9), we have \u03bbS = 1 and \u03bdS is the\nprojection on F of the measure \u03bcA .\n\n3.3\n\nComputation of Sc .\n\nWe can remove the set A from the Markov partition to define a new subshift of\nfinite type in the following way. For the sake of definiteness, we assume that the\nfirst line and the first column of A encode the transitions to and from A. We\ndenote by A\u2032 the (N \u2212 1) \u00d7 (N \u2212 1) matrix obtained by removing from A the\nfirst line and the first column. \u03a3\u2032 will denote the subset in \u03a3 of all sequences\nx = (xn ) such that a\u2032xn xn+1 = 1. For convenience we assume that the matrix\nA\u2032 is transitive; if this is not the case, we can restrict our work to the classes of\nrecurrence (for each class the map \u03c3 satisfies expansiveness and specification).\nThe map \u03c6\ne can be restricted to \u03a3\u2032 , thus the dynamical system (\u03a3\u2032 , \u03c3) admits\nexactly one equilibrium state, \u03bc\ne\u2032 , with topological pressure Ptop (\u03c6,\ne \u03a3\u2032 ).\nLemma 3.3. With the previous notations, Ptop (\u03c6,\ne \u03a3\u2032 ) < Ptop (\u03c6,\ne \u03a3).\n\nThe proof can be found in [10]. Another proof based on relative entropy can\nbe found in [8].\nWe can now prove the main lemma of this subsection:\nLemma 3.4. The critical value Sc , defined in (6), is equal to Ptop (\u03c6,\ne \u03a3\u2032 ).\n\nProof. To ease notations we set P \u2032 = Ptop (\u03c6,\ne \u03a3\u2032 ) throughout this proof. Let x\nbe in F . By lemma 3.2 we have just to prove that for every S > P \u2032 , LS (1IF )(x) <\n+\u221e and for S = PS\u2032 , LS (1IF )(x) = +\u221e. We can choose x such that it does not\nbelong to the set Z f \u2212n \u2202R. Therefore \u03c0F\u22121 (x) is a single point x in \u03a3; this\nalso holds for every y in P re1 (x).\nLet n be some integer. The set, P ren1 (x), of points y in P re1 (x) such that\n1\nrA (y) = n (which is well defined because f k (x) never belongs to the boundary of\nthe Markov partition) is a (\u03b50 , n)-separated set of points: all these points belong\nu\ns\nto F \u2282 Wloc\n(x) and all their images by f n belong to Wloc\n(x). If we also assume\n9\n\n\fthat \u03b50 is small enough, the same argument proves that the set f (P ren1 (x)) is\n(\u03b50 , (n \u2212 2))-separated (but not necessarily maximal). Therefore, it follows from\n[21] that there exists some constant \u03ba1 , independent of S and n, such that\nX\n\u2032\n(10)\ne\u03a6(y) e\u2212nS \u2264 e\u03ba1 +C\u03c9 e(n\u22122)P \u2212nS .\ny\u2208P ren\n1 (x)\n\nK\n\nBecause the matrix A\u2032 is transitive, there exists some integer K such that A\u2032\nhas only positive entries. We can assume that n is strictly greater than 2K + 2.\n\u2032\nLet us consider the set En\u22122K\u22122\nof all words in \u03a3\u2032 with length n + 1 \u2212 2K \u2212 2.\n\u2032\nWe pick in each element of En\u22122K\u22122 exactly one point (of \u03a3\u2032 ); this collection of\npoints is denoted by In . As before, there exists some constant \u03ba2 (independent\nof n and S) such that\nX\n\u2032\ne\neSn\u22122K\u22121 (\u03c6)(y)\n\u2265 e\u03ba2 +(n\u22122K\u22121)P ,\n(11)\ny\u2208In\n\nwhere Sn\u22122K\u22121 (\u03c6)(*)\ne\nmeans \u03c6(*)\ne +\u03c6\ne \u25e6 \u03c3(*) + * * * + \u03c6\ne \u25e6 \u03c3 n\u22122K\u22122 (*).\nWe are now going to prove that points y in In can be chosen in such a way\nthat all the f \u2212K\u22121 (\u03c0(y)) = \u03c0(\u03c3 \u2212K\u22121 (y)) are in P ren1 (x).\nWe pick some z in P ren1 (x) and denote by z its preimage by \u03c0; we also set\nz = (zn )n\u2208Z . Hence z1 and zn\u22121 must be different from 1. Because of our\n\u2032\n\u2032\nchoice of K, for each Wn\u22122K\u22121 in En\u22122K\u22122\n, there exist two words wK and wK\n\u2032\nof length K in \u03a3 such that:\n\u2022 the first letter of wK is z1 ,\n\n\u2032\n\u2022 the last letter of wK\nis zn\u22121 ,\n\n\u2032\n\u2022 the word (wK Wn\u22122K\u22121 wK\n) of length n \u2212 1 is admissible for \u03a3\u2032 .\n\nTherefore the point\n\ndef\n\n\u2032\n), zn , zn+1 , . . .\nZ(Wn\u22122K\u22121 ) = . . . , z\u22121 , z0 , (wK , Wn\u22122K\u22121 , wK\n\n(with the initial position in z0 ) belongs to \u03a3, \u03c0(Z(Wn\u22122K\u22121 )) is in P ren1 (x) and\n\u03c3 K+1 (Z(Wn\u22122K\u22121 )) is in the cylinder Wn\u22122K\u22121 .

This is a consequence of ergodicity of the system (F, gF , \u03bdS ).

Let y and y \u2032 be two points in F with y \u2032 \u2208 C1 (y).\nThen we have\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ne\u03a6(y) \u03c6(y) \u2212 e\u03a6(y ) \u03c6(y \u2032 ) = e\u03a6(y) \u03c6(y) \u2212 e\u03a6(y) \u03c6(y \u2032 ) + e\u03a6(y) \u03c6(y \u2032 ) \u2212 e\u03a6(y ) \u03c6(y \u2032 ).\nTherefore, the Lipschitz properties of the functions \u03c6 and \u03a6 (for the quasimetric \u03b7) and the expansion on the unstable leaves imply that there exists some\nconstant C which depends only on f and \u03c6 such that for every n, and for every\nx and x\u2032 in F ,\nX\n\ny\u2208P re1 (x), r1A (y)=n\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2032\ne\u03a6(y) \u03c6(y) \u2212 e\u03a6(y ) \u03c6(y \u2032 ) \u2264 C\u03b7(x, x\u2032 ),\n12\n\n(17)\n\n\fwhere for each y in P re1 (x), y \u2032 is the preimage of x\u2032 in the 1-cylinder C1 (y).\nInequality (17) and convergence for the norm k * k\u221e imply that the series Km (z)\nis uniformly convergent to Lz in \u0393 for the norm k * k\u03b7 . This proves that z 7\u2192 Lz\nis analytic.\nBy Theorem III.8 from [14], for every S > Sc , there exists some open disc in\nC centered at S, such that for every z in this disk, Lz has p(S) dominating simple\neigenvalues, \u03bb1 (z), . . . , \u03bbp (z) and the maps z 7\u2192 \u03bbi (z) are analytic. Because the\nmap log is analytic in C \\ R\u2212 , we can conclude that the map z 7\u2192 log \u03bbz is\nanalytic in a complex neighborhood of ]Sc , +\u221e[.\nIt remains to prove strict convexity of \u03b1 7\u2192 \u03a8(\u03b1) on ] \u2212 \u221e, \u03b10 [. Convexity is\nobvious (by H\u00f6lder inequality). Strict convexity is equivalent to strict convexity\nof the map S 7\u2192 log \u03bbS on ]Sc , +\u221e[. We will assume that the map S 7\u2192 log \u03bbS\nis not strictly convex and will arrive to a contradiction with the fact that A is\na proper rectangle of the Markov partition.\nIf the map S 7\u2192 \u03bbS is not strictly convex, this means that its graph contains\na straight line interval, say I \u2282 ]Sc , \u221e[. In turn, this means that \u03bb\u2032S /\u03bbS is\nconstant on I, which means that \u03bbS = \u039bA e\u03b3A S where \u039bA , \u03b3A are real constants\na priori depending on A. Now we invoke the unicity of analytic continuation of\nanalytic functions to deduce that\n\u2200z \u2208 C\n\n\u03bbz = \u039bA e\u2212\u03b3A z .\n\nwith R(z) > Sc ,\n\nLet us define the smallest return time in A as follows:\n\u03c4 (A) = inf{k \u2265 1 : f \u2212k A \u2229 A 6= \u2205} = inf{r1A (x) : x \u2208 A} .\nUsing Lemma 3.2, we readily get for every S > Sc\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\nX\n\uf8ed\ne\u03a6(y) 1IF (y)\uf8f8 e\u2212nS \u2264\nC\u03c6\u22121\nn\u2265\u03c4 (A)\n\nC\u03c6\n\nX\n\ny\u2208P re1 (x),r1A (x)=n\n\n\uf8eb\n\nn\u2265\u03c4 (A)\n\n\uf8ed\n\n\u039b A e \u03b3A S \u2264\nX\n\ny\u2208P re1 (x),r1A (x)=n\n\n\uf8f6\n\ne\u03a6(y) 1IF (y)\uf8f8 e\u2212nS .\n\nLetting S \u2192 \u221e we deduce that \u03b3A = \u2212\u03c4 (A).\nNow, observe that\n\u03c4 (A) = \u03a8\u2032 (0) = 1/\u03bc(A)\n(remember Remark 3 in Section 2); we use Ka\u010d formula to obtain\n\u03c4 (A) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=\u03c4 (A)\n\nn\u03bcA {r1A = n} .\n\n13\n\n(18)\n\n\f\u25e6\n\nTherefore, r1A (x) = \u03c4 (A) for \u03bcA -almost every x. Since \u03bcA (A) = 1, the topological mixing property imposes that \u03c4 (A) must equal to one, which is absurd since\nthe Markov partition is made of more than two rectangles.\nTherefore, the function S 7\u2192 log \u03bbS is strictly convex on ]Sc , \u221e[, so is the\nfunction \u03b1 7\u2192 \u03a8(\u03b1) = log \u03bbP \u2212\u03b1 on ] \u2212 \u221e, P \u2212 Sc [ = ] \u2212 \u221e, \u03b10 [ .\nExtension to a finite union of rectangles\nWe sketch how to extend the previous proof when the set A is a union\nRi1 \u222a . . . Rik of k \u2265 2 rectangles (of the partition R). In each rectangle Rij we\npick some unstable leaf Fj , and define F as the union of the Fj 's. Up to the\nboundary of \u2202R, this union is a disjoint union. Thus, if we denote by \u03c0j the\nprojection from Rij onto Fj (namely [., Fj ], see [3]). This defines a map \u03c0F from\ndef S\nA onto F = Fj (up to some set with zero-measure for all the measures we\ndef\nare going to consider). Hence the map gF = \u03c0F \u25e6 g is well defined; the Markov\nproperty of the partition R allows again us to define the partitions of n-cylinders;\nbut in this case we will not have gFn (Cn (x)) = F , but only gFn (Cn (x)) = Fj for\nsome j.\nThe definition of the operator LS is the same, but the value of the critical\nS, Sc , is changing. Let A\u2032\u2032 be the matrix obtained from A by removing the\nlines and the columns corresponding to the subscripts ij 's. Let \u03a3\u2032\u2032 be the set of\nsequences x such that for every n, a\u2032\u2032xn ,xn+1 = 1 and let P \u2032\u2032 be the topological\npressure for the dynamical system (\u03a3\u2032\u2032 , \u03c3) associated to the potential \u03c6.\ne Then,\nSc \u2264 P \u2032\u2032 < Ptop (\u03c6, \u03a9).\nLemma 3.2 still holds but only if we pick x and y in the same Fj . Accordingly,\nthe proof of proposition 3.4 can be adapted.\nNow, observe that formulas (14) and (15) are still valid, except that we have\nto split the integrals over the Fj 's. Therefore (16) still holds, for some positive\nconstant C.\nHowever, it is important to notice that transitivity on \u03a9 implies that for\nevery j and j \u2032 , the set of points in Fj which returns infinitely many times in\nFj \u2032 is dense. Moreover, if x is a point in Fj \u2032 for every j, the set of preimages\nof x in Fj (for the map gF ) is dense. Therefore exactness of mS still holds and\n\u03bdS is hence ergodic. We can thus again apply Theorem III.8 from [14] to get\nanalyticity of the map S 7\u2192 log \u03bbS .\nThe proof of strict convexity is analogous to the previous case.\n\n5\n\nProofs of Theorem 2.2 and 2.3\n\nProof of Theorem 2.2. Plachky\u2013Steinebach's result applies once we remind\nthat since \u03a8 is strictly convex and real-analytic on ] \u2212 \u221e, \u03b10 [, the function\n\u03b1 7\u2192 \u03a8\u2032 (\u03b1) is strictly increasing on that interval.\nWe also observe that \u03a8\u2032 (\u03b1) \u2192 +\u221e when \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b10 . This is equivalent to show\nthat \u03bb\u2032S /\u03bbS \u2192 \u221e when S \u2192 Sc . On the other hand, \u03a8\u2032 (\u03b1) \u2192 0 when \u03b1 \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\nThis can be showed by using Lemmas 3.2 and 3.4, and convexity.\n14\n\n\fProof of Theorem 2.3. Bryc's Theorem [6] applies. In particular, it says that\nthe variance is equal to \u03a8\u2032\u2032 (0). It is easy to get formula (3) by differentiating\ntwice \u03a8 and using a classical factorisation. The only point to be proved is that\n\u03c3A > 0.\nIt is well-known that the variance can be written as follows\n2\n\u03c3A\n= IEA ((\u03c4A1 )2 ) \u2212\n\n\u221e \u0010\n\u0011\nX\n1\nj\n1 j\n1\nIE\n(\u03c4\n\u03c4\n)\n\u2212\nIE\n(\u03c4\n)IE\n(\u03c4\n)\n.\n+\n2\nA\nA\nA\nA A\nA\nA\n\u03bc(A)2\nj=2\n\nNow we follow the proof of Proposition 4.12, p. 63, in [19] (note that Herglotz's Theorem also applies in our setting). To this end, we just have to check\nthat IEA (\u03c4A1 \u03c4Aj ) \u2212 IEA (\u03c4A1 )IEA (\u03c4Aj ) decreases exponentially fast to 0. This fact\nfollows from the \u03c8-mixing property of the induced system (see [9]):\nIEA (\u03c4A1 \u03c4Aj ) \u2212 IEA (\u03c4A1 )IEA (\u03c4Aj ) \u2264\nX\n\np,q\u2208N\n\npq \u03bcA (\u03c4A1 = p, \u03c4Aj = q) \u2212 \u03bcA (\u03c4A1 = p) \u03bcA (\u03c4Aj = q) \u2264\n\uf8eb\n\nC\uf8ed\n\nX\n\np\u2208N\n\n\uf8f62\n\np\u03bcA (Bp )\uf8f8 \u03b8j = C\u03bc(A)\u22122 \u03b8j\ndef\n\nwhere C > 0, 0 < \u03b8 < 1 and Bp = {\u03c4A1 = p} (we used Ka\u010d formula).\n2\nWe conclude that \u03c3A\n= 0 if and only if \u03c4A1 \u2212 1/\u03bc(A) is a L2 (\u03bcA ) coboundary\nwith respect to g, the induced map on A. But if A is a single Markov rectangle,\nthis is impossible. Indeed, there exists a fixed point for g which is periodic with\nperiod \u03c4 (A) for f (\u03c4 (A) is defined in (18)). Reasoning as above, this leads to a\ncontradiction with the fact that A is a strict subset of \u03a9 in measure. The case\nwhen A is a (finite) union of rectangles is left to the reader.\n2\nTherefore we arrive at the conclusion that the variance \u03c3A\ndefined in (3) is\nstrictly positive. Theorem 2.3 has now a complete proof.\n\nReferences\n[1] M. Abadi, A. Galves, Inequalities for the occurrence of rare events in mixing\nprocesses.
