In particular, the rise of two qualitatively\ndifferent morphologies can be explained by the competition of growth directions implied by the four\ndistinct driving and restoring forces of the model. Each of those forces sets a length scale for the\ndominant mode of a developing step instability. This explains that the wavelengthes of meandering\u2013\ninstabilities observed at vicinal surfaces experimentally are usually larger than the one predicted by\nBales and Zangwill [Phys. Rev. B 41, 5500 (1990)] theoretically.\n\nDuring molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) appropriate\nconditions for the controlled growth of vicinal surfaces\ncan be fine\u2013tuned. This way one tries to fabricate either\natomistically flat or nanostructured surfaces. The ability\nto exert control on structuring along the growth direction\nand fabricate substrates with smallest\u2013scale\u2013built\u2013in periodicies normal to the surface is well advanced. Efforts\nto still enhance abilities to determine functional properties of a grown substrate now focus on the lateral structuring within one layer of growth. One direction along\nthis line is to make use of the inherent instabilities due\nto the dynamics of the growth process itself [1]. A necessary first step is to understand the basic wavelengthes\nof those inherent instabilities just as well as the kind of\nmorphologies which will develop.\nMore then ten years ago, Bales and Zangwill [2] predicted that a growing vicinal surface should undergo a\nstep meandering instability when kinetic step edge barriers suppress the attachments of atoms to decending steps\n[3]. According to their analysis, a straight step is linearly\nunstable against perturbations with wavelengths larger\nthen \u03bbc = 2\u03c0(2\u0393L\u2206 ) and a fastest growing wavelength\n\u221a\nDc\nat \u03bbu = 2\u03bbc (\u0393 = k\u03a9\u03b3\n, L\u2206 = F leq\nHere F de2 ).\nBT\nnotes the deposition rate, D the diffusion constant for\ndiffusion on the terraces and ceq the equilibrium concentration, \u03b3 the step stiffness, \u03a9 the atomic area and kB T\nthe termal energy. Even though the meandering instability has meanwhile been observed in experiments and\nsimulations [4], the quantitative prediction of the Bales\u2013\nZangwill analysis could not be recovered in many of those\nexperimental findings. This point received much interest\nin view of the recent experiments by Maroutian et al.\n[5] at CEA Saclay. Analytical efforts to resolve the disagreement between experimental measurements and theoretical prediction led to a precise study of the limit of\ndesorptionless growth. For to derive a single evolution\nequation in the weakly nonlinear regime this case has\nthe interesting feature of displaying a singularity in the\nspirit of multiscale expansion [6]. As a result, meander\u2013\nwavelengthes larger than the ones predicted by Bales and\n\nZangwill can be explained, however, without reaching the\norder of experimental observations. Other efforts center around the investigation of an extra diffusion current\nalong step edges [7]. Such a current triggers an asymmetry in energy barriers for atoms attaching at kinks from\ndifferent step edge directions, the so called Kink Ehrlich\u2013\nSchwoebel effect (KESE) [8]. KESE can either destabilize or stabilize steps depending on whether the slope of\nthe meander\u2013instability is greater or less than one. In [5]\ncalculations including a stabilizing KESE\u2013current along\nsteps were compared to the further thesis that islands\nmight nucleate at step edges and thereby constitute a\nstill different wavelength of instability. It appeared that\nthe latter thesis fits best to the experimental wavelength\u2013\nvalues.\nNew light was shed on these investigations by experiments which revealed that a morphology qualitatively\ndifferent from the meandering one can develop on vicinal surface as well, with growth conditions being exactly the same as for the meandering\u2013morphology except a different angle of miscut [9]. It can be characterized by the absence of one global growth direction and\nthereby resembles the so called degenerated morphology\n[10]. Thus the insufficiency of theoretical approaches to\nexplain the difference between the wavelength of instability predicted by Bales and Zangwill and the one observed\nexperimtentally was extended by their failure to explain\nthis degenerated morphology. Note that the surface of\nthe in\u2013phase\u2013meandering morphology displayed in the\nSTM topograph in Fig. 1(b) [5] was wrongly identified\nas Cu(1,1,17) and is in fact a Cu(0,2,24) surface [11]. The\ntrue Cu(1,1,17) on the other hand is the one to display\na degenerated morphology [9].\nIn this letter I will introduce a novel model which\ncan explain the rise of two different morphologies as\nwell as their basic wavelengthes including KESE currents\nplus entropic step\u2013step repulsion in the classical Burton\u2013\nCabrera\u2013Frank (BCF) model [12]. It is the competition\nbetween the destabilizing and the stabilizing forces combined in this extended BCF model (EBCF model) which\n1\n\n\fresults into two different kinds of morphologies depending on the difference in magnitude of orthogonal driving\nforces. A careful analysis of this interaction also reveals a\nnew basic wavelength of instability which is in the order\nof the experimental observations.\nTo get an impression of the basic ideas underlaying the\nEBCF let us start with the one sided BCF model, i.e.\nthe model formulated by Burton, Cabrera and Frank in\n1951 for the case of complete supression of attachment of\nadatoms to decending steps. This one\u2013sided BCF model\nconstitutes a moving boundary problem of a diffusion\u2013\nrelaxation equation for the dynamics of the adatoms on\nthe terraces and two boundary conditions for the conservation of mass and the conservation of energy at the\nsteps, respectively:\n1\nc+F\n\u03c4\n* (1 + \u03ba\u03a9\u03b3/kB T )\n\u2202c\nvn = D\u03a9 .\n\u2202n\n\n\u2202t c = D\u22072 c \u2212\nceq = c0eq\n\nfor the initial formation of the instabilities. They trigger\ndestabilizing Jk currents of different magnitudes along\nthe step edge forming in this direction. For to evaluate Jk a quantitative value for the KESE\u2013length Ls (ref.\n[8], Eq.(3)) is required. The relevant kink energy barrier is the one directed in <110>, giving 0.518eV using an effective medium theory potential [14,20]. The\ndiffusion barrier for the jump of a single adatom along\nthe step edge in this direction is 0.399eV [14,20], leading to a KESE\u2013length Ls of 201.2. The resulting jk\ncurrent densities for Cu(0,2,24) versus Cu(1,1,17) differ by one order of magnitude: for Cu(0,2,24) jk takes\na value of 7.118 * 10\u22127 (\u00c52 s)\u22121 , whereas at Cu(1,1,17)\njk = 6.396 * 10\u22128 (\u00c52 s)\u22121 . Despite their different magnitudes in both cases KESE currents are destabilizing,\nfavoring unsaturating amplitude growth. Wavelengthes\nof instabilities turn out to be even less then in the BCF\nmodel. As a consequence taking into account KESE as\nonly additional driving force in the BCF model is not well\nsuited to explain the experimental work by T. Maroutian\nand coauthors. An obvious antagonist of the destabilizing KESE is the repulsion due to the succeeding step.\nEntropic just as well as elastic interactions [16] have to\nbe taken into account. Since the step interaction engergy A considering an elastic or a dipole momentum\nis small compared to the entropic repulsion in the temperature ranges under discussion [15], it is sufficient to\nextend Eq.(2) by taking into account the surpression of\nstep wandering:\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\nHere c denotes the areal adatom density, c0eq the equilibrium concentration for a straight step and \u03ba the step\ncurvature. Equations (2) and (3) are to be evaluated at\nthe front of each step. For vicinal Cu surfaces in the\ntemperature range of the experiments under discussion a\ncurrent involving the diffusion coefficient Dm along the\nkinked steps is operative [7]. Following the notation of\nPierre\u2013Louis et al. [8] this diffusion along steps plus its\nanisotropy due to KESE can be included in the moving boundary problem above extending Eq.(3) by \u2212\u2202x J,\nwith J = Jk + Je (Jk , Je as in Eq.(2)\u2013(4) in the paper of Pierre\u2013Louis et al.). Note that unlike the authors\nof [8] I consider \u03b3 to be the step stiffness instead of the\nline tension as the precise measure of the step's tendency\nto straighten and thus reduce its kink density. As a\nconsequence it is taken into account that just as surface undergoing a faceting instability develops into the\nsurface\u2013tension\u2013minimizing morphology, instabilities at\nstep edges have ideal orientations which can minimize\nline tension as well. This is crucial for the model since\nthis is exactly the point in which the Cu(1,1,17) and the\nCu(0,2,24) vicinal surface differ. Both surfaces are made\nup of (001) terraces of monoatomic hight and mean terrace width l = 21.7\u00c5. However, for the Cu(1,1,17) surface straight step edges before the growth of instabilities\nare parallel to the <100> direction, whereas they are\nparallel to <110> in the case of Cu(0,2,24). As a consequence the direction of minimal step stiffness, which\ncan be determined to be in <130> via an embedded\natom method (in analogy to [13] for surfaces), encloses\nan angle of appr. 63.50 with the straight steps in case\nof Cu(0,2,24), whereas the angle is appr. 71.50 in the\ncase of Cu(1,1,17). Since growth proceeds in the direction of minimal step stiffness, these are the orientations\n\nceq = c0eq * (1 +\n\n(\u03c0kB T )2\n\u03ba\n* (\u03a9\u03b3 +\n))\nkB T\n6l2 \u03b3\n\u2202c\nvn = D\u03a9\n\u2212 \u2202x J\n\u2202n\n\n(2\u0303)\n(3\u0303)\n\nThe additional term (\u03c0kB T )2 /6l2 \u03b3 is the step interaction\nparameter with l equal the width of the terraces. Equations (1), (2\u0303) and (3\u0303) constitute the extended BCF model\n(EBCF). Its simulation with T=280K, F=3*10\u22123 ML/s,\nl=21.7 \u00c5, Dm = 10\u22126 cm2 /s, ceq = 8.208 * 10\u22126 \u00c5\u22121 and\n\u03b3= 1.034*eV/\u00c5 yields the following two morphologies for\nthe Cu(0,2,24) surface (Fig. 1) and the Cu(1,1,17) (Fig.\n2), respectively.\nThe four components regulating growth of instabilities\nin the EBCF are\n1. driving of growth via the gradient of the adatom\ndiffusion field normal to the interface setting the\nlength scale L\u2206 for a primary wavelength of instability\n2. restore via step stiffness (corresponding length\nscale: \u0393)\n3. driving of amplitude growth via KESE (length\nscale: Ls , ref. [8])\n2\n\n\fIn the situation depicted by Fig. 2 the magnitude of the\nKESE current derivative \u2202x J is neglectable small. The\nremaining forces due entropic and step stiffness effects act\nin directions perpendicular to each other. The result of\nthis competition of prependicular forces of equal strength\nis the degenerated morphology as observed in other contextes with an analogous competition of driving forces\n[10].\n\n4. restore via entropic repulsion (length scale: LS =\n6\u03b3l2\nkB T \u03c0 2 ) .\n\nGU\n\nIn contrary in Fig. 1 the KESE current does contribute\nto the evolution of surface morphology. The magnitude\nof the driving force due to this current is of an order 10\nsmaller then the magnitude of the adatom diffusion field\ngradient in direction of minimal step stiffness. The precise factor is evaluated via simulation and reads 11.129\nfor the simulation run done for Fig. 1 averaged over 500\ntimesteps. Due to the dominance of L\u2206 growth can proceed in the direction of minimal step stiffness.\n\n2100\n\n1450\n\n800\n\nFor to understand the basic wavelength of the instability the two new length scales LS and Ls , set by entropic\ninteraction as in Eq.(2\u0303) and by an anisotrop diffusion current along the step as in Eq.(3\u0303) respectively, have to be\ntaken into account. Eq.(1),(2\u0303) and (3\u0303) constitutes a system with a type I bifurcation [17]. It's dispersion relation\ncan be evaluated in analogy to a dilute binary alloy undergoing directional solidification [18].

A train of 15 steps with periodic\nboundary conditions in lateral direction is displayed. Horizontal boundary conditions are periodic as well.

The '+'\u2013data points are taken from [5] and give\nthe wavelength measurements recorded there. The full line is\nthe solution of (4). Crosses with errorbars are data points obtained from simulation with the EBCF. There are limitations\nto a precise wavelength\u2013measure in the simulations. Due to\nthe horizontal periodic boundary conditions wavelengthes are\nalways a divider of the system's width. Enlargening this system width systematically until the rise of a further cell as\nwell as restricting the width until the extinction of one of the\ncells allows to find upper and lower bounds. Data points are\nthe mean of these bounds which themselves are taken into\naccount via the error bars. Thus each data point is a result\nof up to 15 simulations with different system widthes.\n\nof the different effects of KESE at the different surfaces.\n\n[1] J.\u2013K. Zuo and J.F. Wendelken, Phys.

Ala\u2013Nissila,\npreprint, (2001)\n\nThe extended BCF explains two relevant new results\nfor growth at vicinal surfaces, namely the experimentally\nobserved deviation from the Bales\u2013Zangwill instability\nand the rise of a degenerated morphology. These results are related to experimental findings in the group of\nH.\u2013J. Ernst. The new basic wavelength predicted theoretically from the EBCF\u2013model can be observed as initial perturbation of the step at Cu(0,2,24) just as well\nas Cu(1,1,17) surfaces. The qualitative difference between their morphologies, i.e. whether a surface displays\nan in\u2013phase\u2013meandering (Cu(0,2,24)) or a degenerated\nstructure (Cu(1,1,17)) after deposition of a few monolayers, depends on the magnitude of the angle between\nthe direction of destabilizing and restoring force. Time\nscales for the development from initial perturbation to\nthe full degenerated morphology could not be compared\nwith experiments due to the lack of experimental data. It\nseems an interesting question whether in situ transitions\nfrom one morphology to the other can be obtained via\na change in the ratio of driving forces (e.g. by lowering\ntemperature during the experiment). If this morphology\ntransition displays features which resemble a true phase\ntransition remains to be investigated.\nThe diffusion\u2013relaxation Eq.(1) is solved on a\nquadratic grid. The interface is discretized separatly by\ncurvilinear segments and respective interpolations from\nthe interface to the grid. Details of the scheme and its\nparallelization will be given in a further paper.\nI thank T. Maroutian and M. Rusanen for sending me a\nSTM\u2013picture of the true Cu (1,1,17) surface\u2013morpology\nas well as a respective preprint prior to publication. Comments by H. M\u00fcller\u2013Krumbhaar to focus my attention on\na precise understanding of the basic wavelength of instability arising in the EBCF\u2013model are gratefully acknowledged. Part of the computations were done on the T3E\nand the Origin 3800 of the URZ at Dresden Technical\nUniversity.\nNote\u2013The two surfaces (Cu(1,1,17) and Cu(0,2,24)) have\nalso been modeled in [20] on the basis of a kinetic Monte\nCarlo algorithm without taking into account entropic repulsion. The agreement with experimental findings remains restricted, nevertheless it is a very precise study\n\n4\n\n\f"}
