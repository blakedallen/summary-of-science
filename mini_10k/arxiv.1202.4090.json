A large-scale and efficient synthesis of fully-fluorinated boron hydrides,\ne.g. icosahedral B 12 F 12 2\u2212, has been also reported [2]. On the other hand, the all-boron C 3v -B 12 cluster is\nquasi-planar and was reported to be one of the most stable all boron clusters. It was also established by\nextensive computations that the quasi-planar B 12 cluster is much lower in energy than the all-boron\nicosahedral B 12 cluster. This was reported not only for the neutral clusters [3] but also for the charged\nones [4]. It is then interesting to investigate what happens with the relative stability of the two (quasiplanar and 3D) all-boron structures upon addition of hydrogen or fluorine atoms. This is the purpose of\nthis study.\nQuasi-planar and 3D boron clusters with the number of hydrogen atoms smaller than the number of\nboron atoms have been studied both theoretically [5-11] and experimentally [12-14]. Ohishi et al. [12]\nreported the formation of B 12 H n + (n = 0-12) cationic clusters through ion-molecule reactions of the\ndecaborane ions (B 10 H n +, n = 6-14) with diborane molecules (B 2 H 6 ) in an external quadrupole static\nattraction ion trap. The mass spectrum analysis reveals that among B 12 H n + clusters with different\nhydrogen content n the B 12 H 8 + molecule is the main product. In the same study, using first principle\ncalculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory, the authors compared the relative energies of\nquasi-planar and 3D B 12 H n + clusters with n varying from 0 to 12. According to that study 2D clusters\nwith n = 0-5 are energetically preferred over the 3D structures, whereas 3D clusters are energetically\nfavored for n \u2265 6. In a more recent combined experimental/theoretical study, Ohishi et al. [14]\nsuggested that quasi-planar B 12 H n + with n = 0-3 clusters can be obtained by further removal of H atoms\nfrom the decaborane ions. This opens up the possibility of changing the structure of the B 12 H n + cluster\nby controlling the number of hydrogen atoms in the cluster.\nTo our knowledge, there are no previous studies on the structure and properties of quasi-planar\nB 12 F m clusters. However, the structures of two polyboron fluorides, B 8 F 12 and B 10 F 12 , revealing\nunusual open structures were recently determined [15].\n2\n\nTheoretical approach\nThe initial search for the most stable structures of the boron hydrides B 12 H n and boron fluorides\nB 12 F n was done at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory using the FreeON code [16] with no symmetry\nrestrictions. For clusters with an even number of hydrogen or fluorine atoms (even number of\nelectrons), the computations were performed for the singlet multiplicity only, whereas doublet and\nquartet multiplicities were considered for cluster with an odd number of hydrogen or fluorine atoms\n(odd number of electrons). In the later case structures with lower multiplicity were energetically more\nfavorable. For the charged structures a similar analysis has been done and the ground state was found to\nhave the lowest multiplicity.\nNext, the low-lying isomers have been re-optimized using the GAMESS-US code [17] and for the\nresulting structures, the vibrational analysis has been done to identify true local minima. Finally, for\n\n\feach n the lowest lying isomers of B 12 H n and B 12 F n have been further optimized at the B3LYP/6311++G(d,p) level of theory. The nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) values and magnetic\nsusceptibility tensors were calculated using the Gaussian03 package [18]. To obtain the NICS values,\nwe have used the GIAO (gauge-independent atomic orbital) method and the magnetic susceptibility\ntensors were calculated using the CSGT (continuous set of gauge transformations) method.\nIt is important to mention that the \"bare\" B 12 icosahedron undergoes distortions after structural\noptimization and its symmetry is S 2 [3], not I h . However, we will refer to that structure and its\nderivatives as icosahedral or 3D. The quasi-planar or fully planar clusters, for a change, will be often\nlabeled as 2D structures.\nThe QMC calculations are done using the QWalk [19] package in two steps. The first step consists\nin optimizing the trial many-body wavefunction by doing Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) calculations.\nThe trial wave function is of Slater-Jastrow form. The Slater determinants are constructed using\nB3LYP orbitals, generated using the GAMESS-US code with previously optimized geometries within\nthe B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. For the QMC calculations, we use Gaussian basis sets with\neffective core potentials [20]. In the second step, we do fixed-node DMC calculations with previously\noptimized trial wave functions. We use a time step of 0.005 a.u. The DMC error bars are about 0.1 eV.\n3\n\nPlanar vs Icosahedral Structures\nThe procedure for determining the most stable isomers of B 12 H n was very similar to that reported in\nRef. [12], namely we started with optimized icosahedral and quasi-planar B 12 clusters and for a given n\nwe have calculated the total energies of all possible clusters resulting from adding hydrogen atoms to\nthe vertices of the distorted icosahedron or to the outer boron atoms of the quasi-planar structure. 2D\nclusters with an even n have been considered in our previous work [6] and here we have extended the\ninvestigation to an odd n. The energetically most favorable 2D and 3D B 12 H n structures are shown in\nFig. 1. The minimum-energy cluster structures of B 12 F n , shown in Fig. 2, have been found by replacing\nthe hydrogen atoms of the low-lying B 12 H n isomers by fluorine atoms. Interestingly enough, the\nresulting structures are similar to those found for B 12 H n . One of the small differences is that the B-F\nbonds are on average ~13% longer than the B-H bonds.\nIn Fig. 3, we have plotted the total energy difference between quasi-planar (or fully planar) and\nicosahedral B 12 X n (X = H, F) clusters as a function of n, the number of H or F atoms in the cluster. As\ncan be seen from the figure, the quasi-planar clusters with up to 4 hydrogen atoms are more stable than\nthe corresponding icosahedral structures (a similar result has been recently reported [11] for B 12 H n 0/\u2212\nclusters). The same is true for the fully planar B 12 F 6 molecule, which is 0.63 eV lower in energy than\nthe 3D cluster. The 2D and 3D B 12 F 5 isomers are almost degenerated in energy. From Fig. 3 we can\nalso see that the energy difference, E 2D -E 3D , increases monotonically with n, with the exception of the\ntwo \"minima\" for B 12 F 4 and B 12 F 6 . These two minima may suggest an additional stabilization of the\n2D structures over the 3D counterparts due to the presence of aromatic stabilization energy.\nSimilar results to those presented in Fig. 3 were reported for the icosahedral and quasi-planar\nB 12 H n + structures [12]. However, in their recent work, Ohishi et al. [14] have used the PBE0 functional\ninstead of the B3LYP functional to determine the energies of the B 12 H n + clusters. The authors' choice\nwas motivated by the fact that the B3LYP functional may overestimate the energy difference between\n2D and 3D structures. To address this problem, we calculated the energy difference between the 2D\nand 3D structures of B 12 , B 12 H 6 , and B 12 F 6 using the very accurate DMC approach. The DMC E 2D E 3D values are -5.13, 0.79, and -0.47 eV for B 12 , B 12 H 6 , and B 12 F 6 , respectively, whereas the\ncorresponding B3LYP values are -5.34, 0.41, and -0.63 eV, respectively (see Fig. 3). This means that\nthe DMC values are shifted up by a value not larger than 0.4 eV with respect to the B3LYP values.\nThis, however, does not affect the conclusions that are drawn from Fig. 3, since even if we shift up the\ncurves by ~0.4 eV still the quasi-planar B 12 H n and B 12 F n (n = 0-4), and the fully planar B 12 F 6 clusters\nremain energetically favorable.\n\n\f4\n\nFully planar clusters: B 12 H 6 vs B 12 F 6\nAs calculated here and also reported in Ref. [11] the fully planar B 12 H 6 cluster corresponds to a\nlocal minimum of energy, whereas the D 3h -B 12 F 6 structure wins the competition with other 2D and 3D\nisomers and corresponds to a global minimum of energy. Many properties of the B 12 H 6 cluster have\nbeen previously described in Ref. [6], but for consistency purposes, we have repeated some of those\ncalculations at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. The HOMO-LUMO (HOMO, highest\noccupied molecular orbital; LUMO, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) gaps of the planar B 12 H 6 and\nB 12 F 6 structures are 3.54 and 4.39 eV, respectively, whereas the HOMO-LUMO gaps of the\ncorresponding 3D clusters are the same and equal to 2.73 eV. The B\u2013H and B\u2013F interatomic distances\nare 1.179 and 1.326 \u00c5 in B 12 H 6 and B 12 F 6 , respectively. For comparison, the computed B\u2013H and B\u2013F\nbond lengths in borane (BH 3 ) and boron trifluoride (BF 3 ) are 1.190 and 1.318 \u00c5, respectively.\nWhile both 2D structures, B 12 H 6 and B 12 F 6 , have similar shape and size, they exhibit quite\ndifferent magnetic properties that are directly related to aromaticity. First, we have computed the\nanisotropy of magnetic susceptibility. The values for B 12 H 6 and B 12 F 6 are -208.1 and -125.8 cgs-ppm,\nrespectively. The isotropic values of the magnetic susceptibility are -91.9 and -118.2 cgs-ppm for\nB 12 H 6 and B 12 F 6 , respectively. These results suggest that the induced ring current is stronger for B 12 H 6\nthan for B 12 F 6 . Similarly, as reported in Ref. [6] for B 12 H 6 , the central part of the B 12 F 6 molecule has a\nparatropic current flowing inside the inner B 3 triangle. The antiaromaticity of the inner triangle is,\nhowever, smaller for B 12 F 6 than for B 12 H 6 since the NICS(0) values are 3.9 and 13.3 ppm, respectively.\nA global aromatic current is dominant above the B 12 F 6 (B 12 H 6 ) molecule since the NICS values are\nnegative, NICS(1) = -5.5 ppm (-3.6 ppm) and NICS(2) = -4.8 ppm (-5.0 ppm), 1 and 2 \u00c5 above and\nbelow the center of the cluster.\nTo examine the influence of charge on the structure and stability of the fully planar clusters, we\nhave also studied charged 2D and 3D B 12 X 6 (X = H, F) structures. The lowest energy 2D structures\nidentified for B 12 H 6 and B 12 F 6 were used as initial structures for the structural optimization at a given\ncharge state. For the 3D structures, we have made a search over all possible configurations of the\nhydrogen or fluorine atoms. For the lowest energy structures with an even number of electrons, a\nsinglet multiplicity has been assumed, whereas doublet and quartet multiplicities were considered for\nclusters with an odd number of electrons. In the later case clusters with lower multiplicity were\nenergetically more favorable. The structures of the 2D and 3D charged clusters are shown in Fig. 4. It\nhas been previously reported that the fully planar D 3h -B 12 H 6 cluster undergoes structural distortions if\ncharged with one electron, although the quasi-planarity is preserved [6]. In general, all the charged 2D\nB 12 X 6 (X = H, F) clusters are quasi-planar rather than fully planar, what can be seen in Fig. 4. In Fig. 5\nwe have plotted the energy difference between 2D and 3D [B 12 X 6 ]q (X = H, F) structures as a function\nof the cluster charge state q. We have found that the addition of one or two electrons to fully planar\nB 12 H 6 and B 12 F 6 clusters (or the removal of one electron from them) makes those structures even less\nenergetically favorable with respect to the corresponding 3D isomers. This is, however, less\npronounced for B 12 H 6 than for B 12 F 6 as shown in Fig. 5. Finally, should be noted that the quasi-planar\nB 12 F 6 2+ cluster is much more stable than its 3D isomer.\n5\n\nConclusions\nOur DFT and QMC results show that the B 12 H n and B 12 F n (n = 0-4) quasi-planar structures are\nenergetically more favorable than the corresponding icosahedral clusters and that the fully planar B 12 F 6\ncluster is more stable than the 3D counterpart. We have also shown that negative or positive charge\nfurther stabilizes 3D over the 2D B 12 X 6 (X = H, F) clusters (except for B 12 X 6 2+, where the opposite is\nobserved). Our findings are potentially useful for designing larger boron based nanostructures starting\nfrom quasi-planar or fully planar building blocks.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge support given by the Robert A.
