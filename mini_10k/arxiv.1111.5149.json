However, EPR is rather insensitive and typically limited to samples with more than 1010 spins2 . Due to its higher sensitivity, electrically detected\nmagnetic resonance (EDMR) is now widely used to study defects, in particular in indirect,\ndisordered or organic semiconductors3\u20138 . Over the last years, pulsed EDMR (pEDMR) has\ngained considerable interest, since it combines the large toolbox of pulsed EPR methods9\nwith the enhanced sensitivity of EDMR e.g. to identify spin-dependent transport and recombination processes and study hyperfine interactions10\u201318 . However, in many cases pEDMR\nsuffers from strong low-frequency noise and large non-resonant background signals induced\nby the strong microwave pulses used to manipulate the spin system11 . Here, we demonstrate\nthat for pEDMR, a lock-in detection scheme is able to subtract the non-resonant background\nand effectively reduce low-frequency noise by more than one order of magnitude following\nsimilar ideas that have been applied in conventional pulsed EPR spectroscopy19 .\nIn the pulsed EDMR discussed here, the symmetry of a spin pair is changed by resonant\nmicrowave pulses resulting in a change of the recombination rate of excess carriers, which is\nreflected in a current transient after the microwave pulses. The pEDMR signal is obtained\nby box-car integrating the current transient after the pulse sequence over a time interval\n\u2206t, resulting in a charge \u2206Q proportional to the recombination rate at the end of the pulse\nsequence10 , as schematically shown in Fig. 1 (a). However, the strong microwave pulses\nalso cause spin-independent non-resonant changes of the current due to e.g. rectification in\nthe semiconductor sample resulting in additional noise and background signals which are\ntypically much larger than the spin-dependent signals. These effects can be mitigated by\nusing a lock-in detection scheme for pEDMR measurements, as will be described in the\nfollowing.\nLock-in detection employs modulation of a signal at a certain frequency and its phasesensitive detection in combination with bandpass filtering20 . We will discuss how such a\nscheme can be implemented in pEDMR exemplarily for the measurement of electrically\ndetected spin echoes. We use a \u03c0/2-\u03c41 -\u03c0-\u03c42 -\u03c0/2 spin-echo pulse-sequence, where \u03c0/2 and\n\u03c0 denote microwave pulses with corresponding flipping angles and \u03c41 and \u03c42 denote the\nduration of periods of free evolution [Fig. 1 (a)] 21 . Depending on the phase of the projection\npulse (indicated in Fig. 1 by \u00b1x), the detection echo-sequence forms an effective 2\u03c0 pulse\nfor (+x) or an effective \u03c0 pulse for (-x), since a phase change of 180\u25e6 results in a reversed\n2\n\n\fsense of rotation of the spin states on the Bloch sphere. Thus, the echo amplitude for a\n(-x) projection pulse is inverted when compared to a (+x) projection pulse. By repeating\nthe spin echo pulse sequence Ncycle times with a shot repetition time \u03c4srt and inverting the\nphase for every shot, the signal is square-wave modulated at a frequency fmod = 1/(2\u03c4srt).\nFor phase-sensitive detection, the \u2206Q detected for (+x) and (-x) are multiplied by +1 and\n-1, respectively, and the result is averaged over all cycles. As shown below, this scheme\nis only sensitive to signals within a bandwidth \u2206f = 1/(2Ncycle \u03c4srt ) = 1/Tmeas around the\nmodulation frequency fmod , where Tmeas denotes the overall measurement time.\n(a)\nmw on\nmw off\n\n(-x)\n\n(+x)\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03c41=300ns \u03c42\nPhotocurrent\n\n...\n\n2\n\n\u03c4srt\n\u2206t\nNcycle-times\n\n(b)\nLock-in signal (arb. u.)\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\nNcycle=30\n\nx1\n\n\u2206t=1/(10 fmod)\n\nx2\n\n\u2206t=1/(20 fmod)\n\u2206t=1/(200 fmod)\n\nx20\n\n1\n\n3\n\n(c)\n\nf/fmod\n\n5\n\nNcycle=15\n\nLock-in signal (arb. u.)\n0.4\n\n7\n\nNcycle=30\nNcycle=60\n\n\u2206t=1/(10 fmod)\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\nf/fmod\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\nFigure 1. (a) Pulse sequence to measure electrically detected spin echoes. For signal modulation,\nwe alternately apply the spin-echo pulse-sequence with the phase of the last \u03c0/2 pulse set to (+x)\nand with its phase set to (-x). This cycle is repeated Ncycle -times. The current transients (solid line)\nafter the mw pulses consist of a spin-independent non-resonant (dashed line) and a spin-dependent\nresonant part. After the (-x) spin-echo pulse-sequence the resonant contribution to the current\ntransient is inverted when compared to the current transient after the (+x) pulse sequence. The\nshaded area indicates the box-car integration interval \u2206t. (b) Calculated response of the lock-in\ndetection scheme h\u0304(f ) for different box-car integration intervals \u2206t scaled by the indicated factors.\n(c) Bandwidth calculated for different numbers of cycles Ncycle .\n\n3\n\n\fIn contrast to conventional lock-in detection schemes, the signal in pEDMR is integrated\nonly over the time interval \u2206t which is typically much smaller than the shot repetition time\n\u03c4srt = 1/(2fmod). We therefore calculate the response h(f ) of the detection scheme including\nthe box-car integration interval \u2206t for an input signal of the form sin(2\u03c0f t + \u03c6) representing\na noise component with frequency f and random phase \u03c6. The function h(f, \u03c6) is given by\nh(f, \u03c6) =\n\n1\n\nNcycle \u22121 \u0014\u02c6 2n\u03c4 +\u2206t\nsrt\nX\n\nNcycle n=0\n\u02c6 (2n+1)\u03c4srt +\u2206t\n\nsin(2\u03c0f t + \u03c6)dt\u2212\n\n2n\u03c4srt\n\n#\n\n(1)\n\nsin(2\u03c0f t + \u03c6)dt .\n\n(2n+1)\u03c4srt\n\nSince the phase of the noise signal is random, the response h(f, \u03c6) has to be averaged over\n\u03c6, giving\nh\u0304(f ) =\n=\n\ns\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\n\u02c6\n\n2\u03c0\n\nh(f, \u03c6)2 d\u03c6\n\n0\n\nsin(\u03c0f \u2206t) sin(2\u03c0f Ncycle \u03c4srt )\n\u221a\n.\n2\u03c0f Ncycle cos(\u03c0f \u03c4srt )\n\n(2)\n\nThe function h\u0304(f ) is plotted in Fig. 1 (b) for different box-car integration intervals \u2206t=1/(10fmod ),\n1/(20fmod) and 1/(200fmod) with Ncycle = 30. The lock-in detection scheme is only sensitive to signals at odd harmonics of fmod . For longer integration intervals \u2206t, the higher\nharmonics are suppressed when compared to the fundamental frequency while for short \u2206t\nsupression is not effective as can be seen for \u2206t=1/(200fmod ) in Fig. 1 (b). This can be\nunderstood by considering the frequency dependence of the envelope of the peaks, which is\ndetermined by the sin(\u03c0f \u2206t)/f term of (2). For f \u2206t \u226a 1, this term can be written as \u03c0\u2206t,\nwhich is independent of the frequency f and therefore all harmonics contribute equally.\nIn pEDMR, the photocurrent response typically occurs as a transient which decays within\ntens of microseconds after the mw pulses10 , while typical shot repetition times are 1 ms and\ntherefore fmod \u2206t = \u2206t/(2\u03c4srt ) \u2248 1/100 \u226a 1. Therefore, the modulated signal contains\nfrequency components at odd multiples of fmod up to a frequency f \u2248 1/\u2206t \u2248 50 kHz.\nFor a cut-off frequency of a high-pass filter f3dB = 2 kHz typically used to surpress lowfrequency current noise which is larger than the modulation frequency fmod < 500 Hz,\nthe first harmonics are surpressed, but most of the signal at higher harmonics will pass\nthrough the filter. The width of the peak at the fundamental frequency (as well as for all\n4\n\n\fharmonics) and therefore the bandwidth of the lock-in detection scheme \u2206f \u221d 1/Ncycle and\nthus \u2206f \u221d 1/Tmeas , as shown in Fig. 1(c) for \u2206t=1/(10fmod ).\nFor an experimental demonstration of this detection scheme, we use Si:P epilayers consisting of a 22 nm thick Si layer with a nominal P concentration of 9 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22123 , covered\nwith a native oxide and grown on a 2.5 \u03bcm thick, nominally undoped Si buffer on a siliconon-insulator substrate. EDMR signals observed in this type of sample originate dominantly\nfrom spin-dependent recombination between 31 P donors and Si/SiO2 interface states (Pb0 )22 .\nFor electrical measurements, interdigit Cr/Au contacts with a spacing of 20 \u03bcm covering\nan active area of 2 \u00d7 2.25 mm2 are evaporated. All experiments are performed at \u223c5 K\nin a dielectric microwave resonator for pulsed EPR at X-band frequencies. The samples\nare illuminated with above-bandgap light and biased with 100 mV resulting in a current\nof \u223c60 \u03bcA. The current transients after the pulse sequence are amplified by a custom-built\nbalanced transimpedance amplifier (Elektronik-Manufaktur, Mahlsdorf) with low- and highpass filtering at cut-off frequencies of 1 MHz and 2 kHz, respectively. In all experiments,\nwe choose the microwave frequency and external magnetic field such that the microwave\npulses resonantly excite the spectrally isolated high-field P hyperfine line22 . We apply the\nspin echo pulse sequence with 30 ns long \u03c0 pulses, Ncycle =1000 and a shot repetition time\n\u03c4srt =5 ms resulting in a modulation frequency of fmod =100 Hz.\nIn Fig. 2(a), the integrated charge is shown separately for (+x) and (-x) as a function of\n\u03c42 for \u03c41 =300 ns. The echo peaks are visible at \u03c42 =300 ns on top of a large background with\npositive echo amplitude for (+x) and negative echo amplitude for (-x) while the background\nis the same for the two phases. To recover the signal, we subtract the two traces from each\nother resulting in the trace (+x)-(-x) shown in Fig. 2(b). For comparison, the echo traces\n(+x) and (-x) after subtraction of the background taken as the smoothed average of the\ntwo traces (black line in Fig. 2(a)) are shown as well. In addition to the effective removal of\nthe background, comparison of the noise level in traces (+x) and (-x) with their difference\n(+x)-(-x) illustrates the considerable reduction of noise by the lock-in detection scheme.\nThe benefit of this modulation scheme is further demonstrated by measuring the noise\nas a function of the modulation frequency fmod . To change the modulation frequency fmod\nindependently of the measurement time, in every cycle we repeat the pulse sequence (+x)\nNavr -times followed by Navr pulse sequences (-x), so that fmod = 1/(2Navr \u03c4srt ).

By increasing\nthe modulation frequency from several mHz to 100 Hz the signal-to-noise ratio is improved\nby more than one order of magnitude. The data point at fmod =0.025 Hz is measured with\n\u03c4srt =20 ms, Navr = 1000 and Ncycle = 1 resulting in a 4 times longer measurement time\nTmeas when compared to the other data points. Since the bandwidth of the lock-in detection\nscheme \u2206f \u221d 1/Tmeas , the obtained noise amplitude is divided by 2 to make it comparable\nwith the other values. The data point at fmod =0.3 mHz is taken without phase modulation.\n6\n\n\fIn this case, fmod is calculated as the inverse of the overall measurement time.\nThe signal-to-noise ratio saturates both at low as well as at high frequencies. A measurement of the current noise of the illuminated Si sample without the application of microwave\npulses shows that the noise floor at high fmod is determined by the current noise of the\nsample (data not shown). The current noise spectrum shows a strong increase of the noise\nat low frequencies, which is, however, removed effectively by the high-pass filter of the amplifier, so that a flat noise spectrum is observed at its output. We therefore conclude that\nthe strong decrease of the signal-to-noise ratio at lower frequencies observed in Fig. 2 (c)\nis due to low-frequency noise of the background current transients induced by the strong\nmicrowave pulses. We tentatively attribute this noise to low-frequency variations of the mw\npulse amplitude, which, due to the non-resonant current transients, has stronger effects on\nEDMR measurements when compared to ESR. This noise, although at low-frequencies, is\nnot removed by the high-pass filter as discussed below.\nSince the amplitude of the non-resonant current transients is independent of the phase\nof the mw pulse, the background signal contains Fourier components at even multiples of\nfmod , while the Fourier components of the signal occur at odd multiples of fmod as sketched\nin Fig. 2(d). Both signals occur on the same timescale and therefore contain Fourier components up to \u2248 50 kHz as discussed above. Noise in the amplitude of the mw pulses at\nfrequencies fnoise will be mixed with the background signal resulting in noise components\nat 2fmod \u00b1 fnoise and higher even harmonics, which are not filtered out by the high-pass\nfilter. However, the lock-in detection scheme is only sensitive to signals at odd harmonics\nof fmod (see Fig. 1) and, therefore, the low-frequency noise is removed for large fmod as\nshown in Fig. 2(c). Since noise at fnoise = fmod cannot be removed by lock-in detection, the\nsignal-to-noise ratio decreases for smaller fmod due to the low-frequency noise.\nIn most pulsed EDMR experiments until now, the large microwave-induced background\nis removed by measuring additional traces at different values of the static magnetic field\nwhere no resonant processes are observed11 . In the approach presented here, no additional\ntraces at off-resonance fields have to be measured since the background is subtracted by\nthe lock-in detection scheme. Since for a spin echo without lock-in detection conventional\npEDMR measurements were performed at typically two additional values of the magnetic\nfield, the phase-cycling itself reduces the measurement time by a factor of 3. Together with\nthe tenfold increase of the signal-to-noise ratio due to the lock-in detection, this leads to a\n7\n\n\freduction of the measurement time by a factor of \u223c300. In principle, for pulse sequences\nwhere phase modulation is not feasible, other parameters like the microwave frequency or\nthe magnetic field can be modulated.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated theoretically and experimentally a lock-in detection\nscheme for pulsed EDMR experiments which significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio.\nThis scheme allows to extend the experimental methods of pEDMR to more advanced pulse\nsequences16,17 and opens its application to other materials and spin-dependent processes to\nbe studied with this technique.\nThis work was supported by DFG (Grant No. SFB 631, C3) and BMBF (EPR-Solar,\nGrant No. 03SF0328).\n\nREFERENCES\n1\n\nJ.-M.
