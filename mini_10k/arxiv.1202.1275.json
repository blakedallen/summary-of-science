It was\nshown that for any black hole mass, holography implies a phase space of just one\nquantum associated with the interior of the black hole. Here we study extremal\nrotating and charged black holes and obtain unique values for ratios of angular\nmomentum to entropy, charge to entropy, etc. It turns out that these ratios can be\nexpressed in terms of fundamental constants in nature, having analogies with\nother physical systems, like in condensed matter physics.\n\n1\n\n\fIn recent papers (Sivaram & Arun, 2010; 2011) we had developed a unified picture of black\nhole entropy and curvature which was shown to lead to Hawking radiation. Invariant\nunderlying relations connecting curvature with Hawking luminosity and temperature were\nstudied. It was also shown that irrespective of the mass of the black hole, holography implies\na phase space associated with the interior volume which remarkably turned out to be just one\nquantum of phase space filled with just one photon: (Sivaram & Arun, 2009)\n\n\uf028d\n\n3\n\n3\n\npd x\n\n\uf029\n\n3\n\ninsidehorizon\n\n\uf0e6 \uf068c 2 \uf0f6 \uf0e6 GM \uf0f6\n\uf0f7\uf0f7 \uf0b4 \uf0e7 2 \uf0f7 \uf03d \uf068 3\n\uf03d \uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8 GM \uf0f8 \uf0e8 c \uf0f8\n3\n\n... (1)\n\nHere we study extremal rotating and charged black holes and obtain unique values (expressed\nonly in fundamental physical constants!) for ratios of angular momentum to entropy, charge\nto entropy, etc. These relations have analogues in familiar physical systems, for instance in\ncondensed matter physics.\n\nc3\nIn earlier papers, we had obtained for any black hole: Entropy \uf0b4 horizon curvature \uf03d k B\n,\n\uf068G\nthe Planck curvature \uf03d\n\nc3\n, and similar relations for other associated quantities.\n\uf068G\n\nNow consider extreme rotating black holes whose angular momentum (for any mass M) is\ngiven as:\n\nJ\uf03d\n\nGM 2\nc\n\n... (2)\n\nThe area of the horizon is:\n\nA~\n\nG2M 2\nc4\n\n... (3)\n\nSo that the angular momentum per unit area is:\n\n\uf073\uf03d\n\nJ c3\n\uf03d\nA G\n\n... (4)\n\nNow the entropy per unit area, works out as:\n\nS \uf03d kB\n\nGM 2\n\uf068c\n\nG2M 2\nc3\n\uf0bb\nk\nB\n\uf068G\nc4\n\n(where the black hole entropy is ~ k B\n\n... (5)\n\nGM 2\n)\n\uf068c\n2\n\n\fEquations (4) and (5), imply the remarkable relation that for extremal black holes (of any\nmass), the ratio of angular momentum to entropy, i.e.:\nJ\n\uf068\n\uf03d\nS kB\n\n... (6)\n\nThis is just the same as for an elementary particle or quantum of radiation! (spin \uf068 , entropy\n\nk B ).\n\nThus the black hole interior volume (for whatever black hole mass in any number of spatial\ndimensions) was earlier shown to be associated with a phase space of just \uf068 3 (having a single\nphoton). Now the ratio of angular momentum to entropy is just \uf068 k B .\nAlso for extremely charged black holes: Q 2 \uf03d GM 2\n\n... (7)\n\nThis implies that the ratio of charge to angular momentum for extremal black holes (of any\nmass) is just:\n\nQ2\n\uf03dc\nJ\n\n... (8)\n\nOr a dimensionless 'black hole fine structure' constant of:\n\nQ2\n\uf03d1\nJc\n(analogous to \uf061 \uf03d\n\n... (9)\n\ng2\ne2\nor\n~ 1 for strong interaction!)\n\uf068c\n\uf068c\n\nAgain the universal relation,\n\n\uf068\nJ\n1\n\uf03d is similar to the von-Klitzing constant 2 in the\n2\nc\ne\nQ\n\ne2\nquantum Hall effect or the Josephson constant\n, in superconductors (it was earlier\n\uf068\nindicated that black holes are diamagnetic, excluding flux, like superconductors).\n\nAgain the charge to entropy ratio is:\n\nQ 2 \uf068c\n\uf03d\nS\nkB\n\n... (10)\n\nAll the above relations involve only the fundamental constants, \uf068, c, k B and are even\nindependent of G, although black holes are strongly gravitating systems!\n3\n\n\fSeveral similar properties of black holes corresponding to those of elementary particles\nincluding the fact that the gyromagnetic ratio of Kerr-Newman extremal black holes is 2, just\nthe same as a Dirac particle were indicated earlier (Sivaram & Sinha, 1977).\n\nReference:\n\uf0b7\n\nSivaram, C. & Arun, K. 2009, Int.
