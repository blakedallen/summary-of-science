E-mail address\nrespectively: nabil.almunawar@ubd.edu.bn, zaw.wint@ubd.edu.bn,\npatrick.low@ubd.edu.bn, and anshari@yahoo.com\n\nwith a better understanding on features and services that can\nimprove quality of services. ICT initiatives in a healthcare\norganization, known as e-health, provide many advantages\nsuch as cost efficiency and patients' empowerment. For\ninstance, online consultation can offer more diverse audiences\n(patients) that unable to come physically for consultation.\nAdditionally, patients' empowerment allows patients/patient's\nfamily to gain access to their medical records online which is\ngood to create sense of awareness to the status their health. In\naddition, e-health extends the scope of conventional healthcare\nboundaries. Regardless the location, physicians can provide\nconsultation over the Internet without even meeting their\npatients physically. Additionally, e-health offers to connect\ndoctors and other healthcare professionals with their patients\nonline [3].\nIn order to explore the expectation of patients for the\nbenefits of e-health above, we have conducted a survey on ehealth systems across the country in Brunei. The survey is\ndesigned to find out the demographical traits of potential\nusers, their opinion of e-health services as well as\ndisseminating the potential abilities of e-health to the public.\nThe objective of the survey is to assess the respondents'\nawareness and demand for e-health services in Brunei. The\nsurvey is also aim to expose online features needed by the\nsystem whether the implementation of e-health system will be\nhelpful to the people, improve customer satisfaction and health\nliteracy among the people which may lead to reduce economic\nburden in the long run for the society. Moreover, the result\nmay contribute to portray the current state of demographical\npatterns and general public opinion on e-health initiatives.\nThe survey revealed important facts that Brunei is\ncomprised of well-educated and highly skilled population\nespecially in terms of applying ICT skills. The survey also\ndepicted the opinion of people in Brunei that the majority of\nrespondents favour to use services provided through e-health\nsystems compared with services that offered through\nconventional healthcare systems. To draw the result of the\nsurvey, the structure of the paper is designed as follow. In\nsections 2, we discuss background of the study and recent\nstatus of customer service in healthcare organizations. The\ntechnical details and analysis of survey are discussed in\nSection 3 and 4 respectively, and finally we conclude our\nfindings in form of recommendations for future direction in\nsection 5.\nII. BACKGROUND OF STUDY\nTo manage customers, an organization needs to know how to\ndeal with their expectations. This involves the ability to detect\ntheir expectations and to identify reasons of their\n\n\fdissatisfactions. The survey focused on customers'\nperceptions, in other words, this is an attempt to listening to\ncustomers in order to understand their needs and expectations.\nA. Healthcare Customer Service\nProviding excellent services to customers is becoming vital\nin today's competitive environment. To survive in today's\ncompetitive market, healthcare organizations must incorporate\ncustomer's viewpoint [1]. Several researchers explained that\nimproving quality of service has a positive effect on\ncustomer's satisfaction [4].\nCustomers' satisfactions can be considered as an integrated\nresponse to evaluation. In other words, improving customers'\nsatisfaction should be a central notion to derive business\nstrategy [5]. Also, offering premium quality of services has\nbecome the most powerful competitive weapon [6]. Since the\npast decades, involving customers in healthcare processes has\nbeen increasingly emphasized, with an appreciation of positive\nimpact on outcomes that follows. As a business entity, a\nhealthcare organization needs to practice the same standards\nof customer service as practiced by other industries or\nbusiness organizations.\nNowadays, customers in healthcare are actively seeking\nhealth information and using it to make decisions about their\nhealth. The high expectations in service on healthcare\norganizations pose a serious challenge for healthcare\norganizations to fulfill as they have to make exceptional\nimpression on every customer. As a matter of fact, poor\nservice may lead customers to switch healthcare providers\nbecause poor service indicates inefficiency, higher cost and\nlower quality of care. Entel et.al [7] recommends that\nhealthcare organizations should become \"empathy engines,\"\nthat is transforming their organizations to allow frontline\nemployees to focus on patient problems and innovate. This\napplies to hospitals, clinics, payers, vendors and pharmacy\nchains as well.\nCustomer service is not an \"extra\" thing. It is an essential\nrequirement for providing high quality healthcare and for\nstaying in highly competitive business [8]. Patients are making\nclear choices about where they receive care based on service\nexperiences; therefore it is crucial for organizations to create\nan institutional ability to sense and respond empathetically [7].\nNowadays patients have more choices to seek care and interact\nwith their healthcare providers. A great customer service can\nlead to major improvements in the healthcare system. In\naddition, a deep understanding of the interaction among\nfactors involved such as quality of healthcare services, their\noutcomes, and patient satisfaction, has become an invaluable\ninput for designing and managing healthcare systems [9]. For\nthis purpose, it is necessary to investigate dimensions service\nquality, which customers perceive as important, in the\nhealthcare context [6].\nB. E-Health Systems\nNowadays, people at all ages, including children and elders,\nfrequently access information on the Internet. ICT can be used\nto provide effective self service and empower customers' care\nthat allows organization to reduce costs by handling an\nincreasing number of customer transactions efficiently.\nMeeting customers' expectations will pose a significant\n\nchallenge on how an organization attaches with their\ncustomers effectively. Thus, the ICT strategy should be\naligned with the business strategy\nin which customers'\nsatisfaction, in ways that acquire new customer, retain them to\nuse the facilities, and extend them to use the other services,\nand must be addressed. Additionally, customers' demands\nhave changed because customers felt empowered by the large\namount of information available to them [10]. Empowerment\non an individual level is a social process of recognizing,\npromoting, and enhancing peoples' abilities to meet their own\nneeds, solve their own problems and mobilize the necessary\nresources in order to control of their lives [11]. There is good\nevidence that coaching patients using empowerment strategies\nleads to broadened, less negative definitions of illness as well\nas improved self management by patients. However, without\ncommitment responses from healthcare organization, the\nbenefits of empowerment are unlikely to emerge [12].\nFollowing the fast pace of advancement in the Web\ntechnology, it is inevitable that healthcare service utilizes the\nWeb technology to develop a more efficient and effective\nhealthcare organization. The Web technology allows medical\nstaffs to monitor their patients remotely and to share\ninformation conveniently on health education or promotion\nprograms with their patients. Utilizing the Web for healthcare,\nwhich often refers to e-health, has several advantages such as\navailability, fast response and convenience.\nWith the advancement of ICT, Web 2.0 technology has\nbrought a possibility to extend the service of e-health by\nenabling patients, patient's families, and community at large\nto participate more actively in the process of health promotion\nand education through social networking process.\nIn light of the Web technology applied on healthcare,\nEysenbach defined e-health as an emerging field in the\nintersection of medical informatics, public health and\nbusiness, referring to health services and information\ndelivered or enhanced through the Internet and related\ntechnologies [13]. In a broader sense, the term characterizes\nnot only a technical development, but also a state of mind, a\nway of thinking, an attitude, and a commitment for network,\nglobal thinking, to improve health care locally, regionally, and\nworldwide by using ICT.\nE-health is gaining its popularity. There are 193 countries\nthat are a member of World Health Organization (WHO) in\n2009; 114 of them participated in the global survey on ehealth [14]. Most developed countries have fully utilized ehealth in their systems as they have the resources, expertise,\nand capital to implement them. While developing countries ehealth systems have not been fully utilized yet.\nSeveral examples of countries that have implemented ehealth are Canada, Singapore and Australia to name a few.\nCanada has established e-health Ontario on March 2009 with\nthree targeted strategies to improve; diabetes management,\nmedication management and wait times. One of the examples\nof the service offered is ePrescribing under the medication\nmanagement. It authorizes and transmits prescriptions from\nphysicians and other prescribers to pharmacists and other\ndispensers [15]. It prevents medication error due to illegible\n\n\fprescribing and reduces fraud prescriptions. Participating\nprescribers and pharmacies at both sites will continue\nelectronically prescribing until a provincial Medication\nManagement System is in place [15].\nC. E-Health in Brunei\nAccording to a 2007 World Health Organization (WHO)\nglobal survey of health services, Brunei ranked 40th out of\n190 countries and 2nd in the ASEAN nations and 4th within the\nWestern Pacific region [16]. Furthermore, the Ministry of\nHealth, Brunei in \"National Healthcare 2000-2010: A strategic\nframework for action June 2000,\" stated that the Ministry's\nvision is to strive to become a highly reputable health service\norganization which is comparable to the best in the region and\nwhich will enable every citizen and resident of the nation to\nattain high quality of life for being socially, economically and\nmentally productive throughout the life span.\nMeanwhile, its mission is to improve the health and well\nbeing of the people of Brunei through a highly quality and\ncomprehensive health care system which is effective, efficient,\nresponsive, affordable, equitable and accessible to all in the\ncountry. National Development Plan (NDP) was first\nimplemented in 2007, where the budget of $149, 152, 000 is\nallocated for medical and health-care. The application of new\ntechnologies is included in this huge amount of money [17].\nThe statistic on Brunei Internet users from 2006 to 2009,\nhas shown an increase in penetration of the Internet of 78.5%\nin Oxford Business Group's 2010 report on Brunei. Brunei's\nnetwork infrastructure will be upgraded to ultra\u2013broadband\nservice connection through fibre optics by late August 2011.\nThe high speed broadband is finally coming to Brunei with a\nmaximum data transfer rate of 150mbps (megabits per\nsecond), a more stable, better network coverage, and\nconsistent Internet experience [18]. This figure brings a\npromise to the initiative of e-health in the country. Though, ehealth has not fully implemented yet in Brunei. Both private\nand public health institutions in Brunei are still using the\nmanual system. Future e-health services may be promoted by\na variety of providers including health practitioners, public\nhealth entities, individuals, groups from private organization\nlike health clubs. The implication of the study for health\npractitioners, customers, healthcare providers and agents of\ncare, ICT developers, researchers, and policy makers are\nproposed.\nIII. METHODOLOGY\nWe use the purposive sampling methods in which\nrespondents were intentionally selected from patients,\npatient's family, or medical staffs from hospitals, clinics, and\nhomecare centre across the country. Majority of the\nrespondents are local Bruneians, who frequently visit health\npractitioners. The respondents range from twenty years old (or\nyounger) to above 51 years old. Therefore, they represent a\nfair share of the general public. There were 366 respondents\nparticipating for the survey which conducted from February to\nMarch 2011. The time taken to complete the questionnaire\nwas between 4-15 minutes. Some respondents required as long\n\nas 15 minutes while others can finish it off in 4 minutes. This\nwas mainly due to their difficulties in answering and\nunderstanding the questions.\nThere were several problems when conducting the survey.\nLanguage barrier was one of the reasons. There were few\nrespondents who were unable to understand English, thus they\nneed Malay translation. There were also some difficulties for\nelderly people to fill the questionnaire since they do not\nunderstand the meaning of e-health. Thus, a prior explanation\nneeded to be done. This problem was not seen for younger\nadults, in which they understand the concept of e-health. This\ncould be explained by the fact that the younger generations\nnowadays are used to with the Internet and electronic media.\nThe 25 questions in the questionnaires were tailored to the\npopulation for this study was divided into three sections. The\nfirst section included 6 questions about demographics' traits of\nrespondents where we learnt on our respondent gender\ncomposition, age, employment type, educational level,\ncomputer literacy, and the time they spend on the Internet.\nNineteen questions in the second part asked about features of\ne-health that were specifically related to their healthcare\nservice. The third section was an open comment that was\nintended to collect respondents' opinions. The questions as\nwell as comments were analyzed to explore the relationships\namong variables for future recommendations, especially for\ndeveloping an e-health framework..\nIV. RESULTS\nBecause no research has ever been published on e-health\nand health information accessibility issues in Brunei, this\npaper is prepared to fill that gap. Many e-health topics are\ncovered, including the use of existing e-health service, health\ninformation accessibility, and current issues like social support\nand social networking. Data gathered from the survey will be\nused to formulate recommendation for future direction of ehealth systems.\nIn order to know a coefficient of reliability (consistency) of\nquestionnaire, the authors use Cronbach's alpha to measure of\ninternal consistency, that is, how to closely related set of items\nare as a group.\n\n\u03b1=\n\nN .c\n(1)\nv + ( N \u2212 1).c\n\nHere N is equal to the number of items, c-bar is the average\ninter-item covariance among the items and v-bar equals the\naverage variance as in (1). If Cronbach's alpha is greater than\nor equal to 0.6 then a variable is reliable.\nTABLE 1\nCOEFFICIENT OF RELIABILITY\nN\nCases\n\nValid\nExcluded\nTotal\n\n%\n363\n\n99.2\n\n3\n\n.8\n\n366\n\n100.0\n\nFrom the table 1 shows that Cronbach's Alpha is found 0.80\nfrom the 363 number of items. It signifies that they have\n\n\frelatively high internal consistency since it is 0.80 > 0.60,\nhence the survey result is reliable.\nFrom the survey, we found that expectations in healthcare\nservices are high, which create a serious challenge for\nhealthcare organizations in Brunei. In response to the\nexpectation, it is significant to add features as front end to tie\nup the interface of e-health. Therefore, it is important to\nimprove customer satisfaction and health literacy in healthcare\nservice to accommodate components and features of social\nnetworking capabilities, empowering patients, and availability\nof online health educator (see figure 1).\nDemographic Information\nThe first section our survey questionnaire was designed to\ngather data about employment type, gender, age composition,\nliving arrangements, level of education, frequency of\ncomputer usage, frequency of Internet usage. When it comes\nto working pattern of the country, it is imperative to shed light\non the respondents work at the government sector, which is\n58%, while the rest, 42%, work at the private sector. This\nreflects the employment pattern in Brunei, where more people\nwork with the government and the new generation is also\ninclined to work with the government for a job security reason\nand welfare benefits provided. The data reveal that there were\nmore females than males in the survey conducted. According\nto the results 54% of female respondents completed the survey\nin comparison to the male who has completed the survey 46%\nonly.\nWhile in the age distribution section, the highest\nrespondents were ranged between the ages of 21-30 years old\nwith the percentage of 38%. There were 19% respondents in\nthe range of 31 to 40, 18% of them were in the ranged of 41 to\n50, where 13 % of them ageing between 20 years old or\nyounger, and 12% were 51 years old and above. This shows\nthat the people at these ages 21 up to 30 years old are the most\napproachable, cooperative and their command in English is\nbetter than the remaining age group so they could understand\nthe questions. Respondents also were asked on their living\narrangements. Some of them either live alone, with family or\nothers such as with friends or lodging. 5% of the respondents\nlive on their own, 90% of them live with their families and 5%\nlive with others. It shows that almost all of the respondents\nlive with the families as this is a typical Bruneian tradition,\nregardless of their marital status.\nIn term of educational level, each respondent has different\nlevel of education. The difference in education level might\nreflect. 10% of the respondents did not complete high school,\n31% of them had completed only high school and 59% have\ncompleted more than high school level. This interprets that\nthere are more educated respondents than those with lower\neducation level. The result of the level of education might\nreflect the result of other factors such as their understanding\ntowards the modern technology especially in ICT they are\ninterrelated.\nAdditionally, the respondents were questioned on how\nfrequent they use the Internet, either at home or at their\nworkplace, regardless of what medium they use to get internet\n\naccess. Based on the survey, almost of the Bruneians\nregardless of their age can easily have access to the Internet,\n63% of the respondents use the Internet at least daily, 18%\nuses less than daily to weekly, 9% uses the Internet between\nweekly and monthly, and 10%, has never used Internet. The\nresult shows that the majority of the respondents are exposed\nto the Internet and they tend to use the Internet everyday.\nThe respondents were also asked on how frequent they use\ncomputer in their everyday life, regardless of the purposes.\nThe majority of the respondents (64% of them) use the\ncomputer everyday, 18% uses computer less than daily to\nweekly, 9% of them uses computer weekly to monthly, and\n9% of them has never use the computer at all. This shows that\nthe computer literacy in Brunei is high and this statement\nsupports the results for usage of Internet and educational level\nas well.\nAccessibility of Health Information\nIn this section, the questionnaires concentrate on\naccessibility of information to patient online. The first\nquestion was asking their agreement to make appointment\nonline with the healthcare organization. Most of the\nrespondents (83%) prefer to be able to make an appointment\nonline. If the online appointment available, it reduces the\nwaiting time for the patients to set the available day and time\nfor their appointment so this will give patient convenience in\nservice and efficiency in time.\nWhen the respondents were asked their opinion on the\nability of service to view their medical records online, the\nstudy shows that 33% (strongly agree) and 46% (agree) of the\nrespondents prefer to view and have control to their medical\nrecords online. This is an interesting result which indicates\nthat they can self-monitor their medical record. The\nknowledge of medical status from historical data available in\nthe medical records may lead to improve healthcare awareness\nand self managed healthcare. In addition, the online medical\nrecord may help them to check and make sure that they have\nthe right health details to avoid miscommunications. Further,\nthe online medical records can be used as a guideline in\nmaking any decision relating to their own health. Although\nmost of the respondents prefer online medical records, some\nrespondents (17%) disagree with idea of their medical records\naccessible online. This is mainly due to the fear of\ninformation breach or manipulation. It is a challenge for future\nresearch in e-health implementation, the security and privacy\nissues need to be considered seriously.\nThe preference of online accessibility and communication is\nfurther enhanced by the tendency to prefer online referral.\nThere are 78% of respondents agree to have an ability for\nrequesting referral online as it facilitates patients to request\ntheir preferred or trustworthy referral online. An interesting\nfinding also was encountered when respondents were asked\nabout their ability to view their medical/healthcare bills. The\nsurvey reveals that 84% of the respondents like the service to\nview their medical bills and insurance coverage details online\nto keep them up-to-date on their payment information.\nAgain, the majority of the respondents prefer online service\n\n\fdue to time efficiency. The survey reveals that 25% of the\nrespondents strongly agreed to view and interact with the\nhealth promotion program online, 56% of them agreed, 16%\ndisagreed, and 3% has strongly disagreed. For example, when\npatients are assigned to have a dietary program, they do not\nhave to travel all the way to the hospital because they can have\naccess the program using the online service provided and it\nsaves time and money. Another benefit also for health\nprofessionals, they can monitor their patients' progress online,\nwhich is convenient for both parties. In addition, patients can\neasily share their health status after conducting their health\nprogram to their friend and relative which is good to gain\nmoral support as well as to promote others to participate.\nHowever, when they were asked the possibility to pay any\nof online service, half of the respondents would rather not to\npay for any online service. The reason is most likely because\nmost Bruneians are already comfortable with the free services\nprovided by the government.\nWhen we asked about their possibilities to communicate\nand consult with health educator online, most of\nthe\nrespondents (25% strongly agree and another 48% of them\nagree) prefer to communicate with their health promoter or\nhealth educator online. Online communication is faster and\nrecorded, furthermore some people are more extrovert and\nmore comfortable when communicating virtually.\nDuring daily health life cycle, we asked them if they were\nable to record of their health related activities online. Most\nrespondents were happy if they can record their health-related\nactivities online (20% strongly and 56% agree) these activities\nmay include a personal health diary where the respondents can\naccess it, anytime and anywhere, facilitating their daily plans\nand programs for a healthy lifestyle. This service can be used\nto monitor their health status and may help in making health\ndecisions later.\nWhen respondents were asked the possibility to share\nanything related to health services provided from a hospital\nwith others in social networks, the majority of them (45%\nagree and 18 % strongly agree) support such a sharing. They\nmay think that sharing is a good way to improve health service\n- since they can discuss certain issues.\nFurthermore, we asked their opinion on sharing health\nproblem or experiences online with those who have similar\nproblems, the survey reveals that most of the respondents\n(56% agree and 21% strongly agree) that they wanted to get in\ntouch with other patients who have the same condition online.\nPeople with similar problems can easily share their experience\nand knowledge online which leads to supporting each other at\nleast morally in facing their problems.\nHowever, when they were asked what if third parties\n(pharmaceutical/insurance\ncompany/medical\nbusiness,\nuniversities, etc) want to get access to their medical records\neither for research development or health product promotion,\nmost respondents (about 80% of them) did not want\npharmaceutical/insurance company/medical business entities\nto have access to their personal medical records online, unless\nthere is prior consent from the particular individual.\nFinal section of the survey allows respondents to comment\n\nfreely on their expectations of an e-health system and its\naccessibility in providing better knowledge on health status.\nMajority of those who filled in their comments support the list\nof abilities provided by an e-health system such as\nconvenience in service, time saving, health promotion,\naccessibility, aware of medical result better, supporting each\nother, etc. For instant, a patient faced the daunting tasks of\ntravelling, there is significant time spent in finding parking\nspace, time spent in the waiting room and then finally waiting\nfor the prescription medicines. So by using ICT, a patient can\ncommunicate with the medical healthcare professional from\nthe comfort of his or her home. Through the health promotion\nprogram, social support systems, e-appointment, online\nconsultation, and all features offered from the e-health systems\nexpected that it will reduce the number of potential patients\nvisit the hospital significantly, improve the quality of\nconsultation, more productive time to other activities, and\nfinally empowering people to responsible (self health\nmanagement) to improve their health status. Furthermore,\nsupport groups such as social networks in healthcare in Brunei\nare not common. Respondents stated their endorsement on the\npossibility of support groups. A patient with who might have\nan illness that is socially shunned could find refuge in a social\ngroup with other patients who are condition as they are.\nV. DISCUSSION AND RECOMENDATIONS\nIn the survey we defined four key enablers and critical\nsuccess factors that provide direction, resource to initiate, and\nrealize their potential disposition from customer perspective.\nUnderstanding and managing of critical success factors are\ncritical for a successful of an e-health initiative.\nThe research points to the issue of demographical pattern\nsuch as age composition, education levels, computer literacy,\nand Internet literacy, as enabler factors that make up typical ehealth initiatives. It is important to see how the enablers have\naffected the preference of e-health services offered. The\nfinding of this survey examines each of the four enablers and\nprovides insight into their relative impact on e-health systems,\nand it is followed some recommendations based on the survey\nfindings.\nEnabler Factors\nLevel of education will affect the acceptability of systems\nand competency of people to utilize it. Higher educational\nlevel means higher possibility to success. In case of Brunei\nthat the education is free and available for everyone, half of\nthe respondents have completed high school, confirmed those\nwho are literate enough understand easier about e-health\nsystems when it is implemented. While comparing gender\ncomposition, It is encouraging to note that the female more\nthan male in healthcare activities. This trend could because of\nfemales have more time to visit healthcare for treatment or\nthey are more vulnerable in health matters than male. Age\ncomposition; majority of respondents are young (from 21 to\n50 years group age). This indicates that younger people are\nlikely to become potential users if it is implemented since they\nmore expose to the technology. Internet accessibility; Majority\n\n\fof the respondents are exposed to the Internet and they tend to\nuse the Internet everyday. Thus, if e-health is widely\nimplanted in Brunei and reached up the whole population it\nwould be a success as drawn from the survey that the people\nare able to access Internet everyday and not to mention that,\nthey were at their 20s and working. Consequently, they afford\nto get an Internet access with their income received and share\nwith their family members. Computer literacy in Brunei is\nenabler factor of e-health initiative, it is found that all of the\nrespondents use computer on daily basis, while only smack\npercent of the respondents use computer a few times a week.\nThis proves that most of the population is computer literate\nand is able to use the computer to get information. Therefore,\nit is believed that e-health service would be supported and\nacceptable by the public. Furthermore, we have already seen a\nvery high positive response from the survey sample.\nIn summary, the majority of respondents are young adults,\nliving with their family, who have completed more than high\nschool, which explains their preference in the implementation\nof the systems. Not only that, they are proficient in ICT as\nwell, considering a number of them uses the Internet and\ncomputer daily.\nRecommendations\nE-health is not going to replace any existing services in\nhealthcare; it is extendable systems which features and\nservices can improve quality of service. It will form healthcare\nservices more comprehensive and reliable in providing better\nservices. The survey confirmed respondents' expectations in\nhealthcare are high, which create challenge for healthcare\norganization. In this section, we recommend new approaches\nand features of e-health to healthcare organization based on\nthe finding. Figure 1 below is the recommendation which\naccommodates ideas of respondents about future e-health\nservices which will be expected to increase customer\nsatisfaction, avoid conflict, and promote better health to\npatient;\n\nOnline Social\nNetworks\n\nEmpowerment\n\nOnline Health\nEducator\n\nE-Health\nSystems\n\nImprove\nHealth\nLiteracy\n\nImprove\nCustomer\nSatisfactio\nn\n\nFig. 1 e-health with features based on Survey\n\nEmpowerment is supported in the health-related literature,\nand it has been used in relation to customers and healthcare\nover the past decade. Customers or in this case patients\n\nempowerment means to support and encourage them to have\nmore responsibility for their own health and to take a greater\nrole in decisions about their own health care. Empowerment is\na characteristic of groups and individuals that energizes them\nwith the knowledge and confidence to act in their own behalf\nin a manner that best meets identified goals. In this sense,\nthen, empowerment characterizes the manner in which\npatients and clinicians approach care, with mutual\nexpectations, rights, and responsibilities. Empowerment\nrepresents a change in philosophy for both care providers and\npatients alike, requiring the former to abandon the\nauthoritative control once held and the latter to assume a\ngreater level of deliberate self involvement in the care process\n[19]. On an individual level, empowerment is a social process\nof recognizing, promoting, and enhancing peoples' abilities to\nmeet their own needs, solve their own problems and mobilize\nthe necessary resources in order to feel in control of their lives\n[11]. For consumers to be fair and equal participants in\nempowered partnerships with clinicians requires that they\nhave adequate knowledge; set realistic goals; access\nsystematic. The survey confirmed that patient preferred to\nhave more ability and control of health information and\napplication that concern with their health status. Making\nappointment online, viewing their medical records, and\nconsulting online with medical staffs are few examples of\nempowerment to patient. The authorization to access health\ninformation will benefit both patient and healthcare\norganization. From patient perspective, their health literacy is\nexpected to improve by the time they have better knowledge\nof their own health status, and for the healthcare organization\nis expected to be long lasting relationship since they always in\nneed to access the service. Additionally, empowerment is also\nbelieved giving them flexible time when and where they want\nto look upon their health related activities. Finally, the authors\nsuggest that the features of empowerment in e-health system\nshould exist in four dimensions; patient-patient interaction,\npatient-provider interaction, disease and its treatment, and\npsychosocial aspect of living.\nSocial Networks and Social Supports are newly features\nintroduce in the systems. Chatherine and Barbara mentioned\nthat social networks and social supports closely affect to\nhealth outcomes [20]. Therefore, we asked respondents\nwhether they need facilities of social networks and social\nsupports online. Majority of respondents agreed social\nnetworks and social support online part of the e-health\nsystems. It should be operated, managed, and maintained\nwithin healthcare's infrastructure. This is more targeted to\ninternal patients/families within the healthcare to have\nconversation between patients/family within the same interest\nor health problem/ illness. For example, patient with diabetic\nwould motivate to share his/her experiences, learning, and\nknowledge with other diabetic patients. Since patient/family\nwho generates the contents of the Web, it can promote useful\nlearning centre for others, not only promoting health among\neach others, but also it could be the best place supporting\ngroup and sharing their experiences related to all issues such\nas; how the healthcare does a treatment, how much it will cost\n\n\fthem, what insurance accepted by healthcare, how is the food\nand nutrition provided, etc. Furthermore, it is also suggested\nthat medical staff or doctors should be actively involved in an\nonline forum discussion to provide professional advice. For\nhealthcare management, conversation generates between\npatients in social networks site can be a starting place to\nconstruct business strategy for an organization. Social\nnetworking site should be moderated by competent healthcare\nstaff within the managerial level to capture the conversation\nand listen what patients say about the service. The role of this\ntask could campaign of healthy life for the society which is not\nintended for commercial benefit for short term but it is\nbeneficial for the community.\nOnline Health Educator plays pivotal role in the process of\ninteraction patient-health provider. Patients should know how\nto use the service. E-health services which empower patients\nto have better knowledge and control over their health data,\nyet they need to communicate with healthcare organization. In\norder to achieve the goal, the presence of online health\neducator determines success or failure of the implementation.\nIt should be part of the implementation strategy to ensure that\nthere are groups of staff to ensure that e-health service is\nmanaged in professional ways. Any health activities which\nthey can accomplish through online service, they may not\ncome physically to the hospital. Though they do not come to\nthe healthcare centre, yet they may need an assistant or\nguidance from online health educator when they face\ndifficulties interacting with systems which they need to\ndiscuss with online health educator for clarification and\ninterpretation such as medical data, online consultation, or\nasking for any online service\nIn light of this, from the survey, confirmed that the\navailability of online health educator is important. Presence of\nonline health educator is the vital point in e-health instead of\nICT as tool. They are expected to have skills to interpret\nmedical data, able to guide patient go through technical\nsystems, and know how to respond online queries properly.\nE-health promotion, education, and in emergency situations;\nit is believed that an e-health system would give advantages\nlike early warning system, especially in emergency situations\nor pandemic. For instance, during the H1N1 flu outbreak, it is\npossible for health authorities to announce preventive\nmeasures over the e-health system to notify the public\nefficiently. In addition, this would also reduce the time-wasted\nin printing leaflets or posters to inform the public in such\nsituations.\nData Ownership and External Access by Third-Parties, from\nour analysis, there is significant evidence suggesting that the\npublic would prefer to keep their medical condition private\nand would not be willing to grant any permission to allow\nexternal parties to access such information. Therefore, our\nrecommendation is critical to research and investigate the role\nof medical data ownership which data belong to patient and\nwhich parties are allowed to have limited access. We conclude\nthat the data ownership and accessibility for patients will\nencourage patient to aware of their own health status which is\ngood to improve health literacy.\n\nThe customer acceptance of technology and the demand for\nonline healthcare services and technology among many\nsegments of the general population has been high, there is\nample evidence in the survey to support the prediction that the\nbenefits of e-health through advanced Information and\nCommunication Technologies have the potential to make\nprofound impact in customer's expectation and all areas of\nhealthcare services.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nImplementation of e-health will enable more patientfriendly healthcare services and at the same time improve\nhealth provider's performance. In the national level, there is\nalso a conscious move or effort by the government to\nunderstand the needs of the public and to continuously\nupgrade service standards. In addition, the availability of ICT\nand the Internet infrastructure as well as the techno savvy of\nthe Brunei population will assist and accelerate the\nimplementation of e-health in the country. The general public\nin Brunei has responded with great support for the features\nand capability of e-health listed from the questionnaires.\nUnfortunately there is a great a gap between available health\nservices and services expected by the public, who seem to\nhave advance ICT literacy. From the survey also it can be\nconcluded that most respondents agrees and are keen in having\ne-health services whilst requiring high degree of\nconfidentiality on their medical information.\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n[2]\n\n[3]\n[4]\n\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\nP.K.C Low, \"Strategic Customer Management\", BusiensscrAFTTM\nConsultancy, 2002.\nM.
