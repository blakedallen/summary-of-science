Fedosov's simple geometrical construction for deformation quantization of symplectic manifolds is generalized in three ways without introducing new variables: (1) The\nbase manifold is allowed to be a supermanifold. (2) The star product does not have to be\nof Weyl/symmetric or Wick/normal type.

In short, the\nterm \"deformation quantization\" refers to the construction of an associative \u2217 product that is an\nexpansion in some formal parameter h\u0304, and whose leading behavior is controlled by a geometric\nstructure mij , which usually (but not always) is a symplectic structure [8]. Fedosov quantization,\nin its most basic form, is a deformation quantization recipe that relies on yet another geometric\ninput in form of a compatible torsion-free tangent bundle connection \u2207. It is an important\nfeature of Fedosov's \u2217 product that it is a global construction, which applies to a manifold as\na whole, and not just a local neighborhood or vector space. Another characteristic feature that\nsets Fedosov's approach apart from most other methods is the assemblage of a globally welldefined, flat connection D. We discuss in this paper the following three natural generalizations\nof Fedosov's original construction:\n1. We let the base manifold be an arbitrary smooth supermanifold. Previous works on superizing Fedosov's construction use Batchelor's theorem (which in turn relies on the existence\nof a partition of unity) to give a non-canonical identification of the supermanifold with\nthe ringed space of sections of the exterior algebra of a vector bundle, so that the bosonic\nand fermionic variables are associated with base and fiber directions in this vector bundle,\nrespectively, see e.g., [13, 44]. On the contrary, we will treat bosons and fermions on equal\nfooting, and will locally allow the use of arbitrary coordinate systems. This of course\nrequires that we pay special attention to sign factors, but it will be more elementary \u2013\nand more general \u2013 in the sense that we will not need any major results from the theory\nof supermanifolds.\n\u22c6\n\nThis paper is a contribution to the Special Issue on Deformation Quantization. The full collection is available\nat http://www.emis.de/journals/SIGMA/Deformation Quantization.html\n\n\f2\n\nK. Bering\n2. We do not assume that mij is antisymmetric. This is sometimes referred to as the \u2217\nproduct does not have to be of Weyl/symmetric type. It is also not necessarily of the\nWick/normal type [9, 10, 11, 36, 14, 18, 42, 19].\n3. We let the two geometric input data mij and \u2207 depend on Planck's constant h\u0304. A priori,\nsuch a generalization is a non-trivial matter, since Planck's constant h\u0304 is charged with\nrespect to the pertinent resolution degree, cf. equation (6.1). Moreover, for h\u0304-dependent\nstructures, there is no analogue of Darboux' theorem at our disposal, cf. discussion below\nequation (3.7).\n\nCertain aspects of each of the three generalizations have appeared in the literature, but\nnever simultaneously. Our main point is that the three generalizations taken together constitute\na natural habitat for Fedosov's original variables xi , ci \u2261 dxi , y i and h\u0304, without destroying the\nsimplicity of his construction.\nThe paper starts with listing the basic setup and assumptions in Sections 2\u20133. Then follows an\nintroduction of the relevant tools: An algebra A of covariant tensors in Sections 4\u20135, the Fedosov\nresolution degree in Section 6, the \u25e6 product in Sections 7\u20139, the Koszul\u2013Tate differential \u03b4 and\nits cohomology in Sections 10\u201311. Thereafter is given a discussion of Riemann curvature tensors\non supermanifolds in Sections 12\u201313. The flat D connection, whose existence is guaranteed\nby Fedosov's 1st theorem (Theorem 1), is discussed in Sections 14\u201316. Fedosov's 2nd theorem\n(Theorem 2), which establishes an algebra isomorphism between symbols and horizontal zeroforms, is discussed in Section 17. Finally, the \u2217 product is constructed in the last Section 18.\nWe shall focus on the existence of the construction and skip the important question of uniqueness/ambiguity/equivalence/classification of \u2217 products for brevity. In detail, this paper is an\nelaboration of the material covered on p. 138\u2013147 in Fedosov's book [24] subjected to the above\ngeneralizations 1\u20133. In particular, what we refer to as Fedosov's 1st and 2nd theorems (Theorems 1 and 2) are generalizations of Theorems 5.2.2 and 5.2.4 in [24], respectively. Some other\nreferences that deal with Fedosov's original construction are [43, 31, 40, 26, 45, 30]. Historically,\nDe Wilde and Lecomte were the first to prove the existence of an associative \u2217 product on every\nsymplectic manifold [46]. The same question for Poisson manifolds (which may be degenerate)\nwas proved by Kontsevich using ideas from string theory [39]. Cattaneo et al. gave an explicit\nconstruction in the Poisson case that merges Kontsevich's local formula with Fedosov's flat D\nconnection approach [15, 16].\nGeneral remarks about notation. We shall work with smooth finite-dimensional supermanifolds in terms of charts and atlases (as opposed to, e.g., ringed spaces or functors of points). We\nshall sometimes make use of local formulas, because these often provide the most transparent\ndefinitions of sign conventions on supermanifolds. We stress that all formulas in this paper, if\nnot written in manifestly invariant form, hold with respect to any coordinate system, and they\ntransform covariantly under general coordinate transformations. Adjectives from supermathematics such as \"graded\", \"super\", etc., are implicitly implied. We will also follow commonly\naccepted superconventions, such as, Grassmann-parity \u03b5 is only defined modulo 2, and \"nilpotent\" means \"nilpotent of order 2\". The sign conventions are such that two exterior forms \u03be\nand \u03b7, of Grassmann-parity \u03b5\u03be , \u03b5\u03b7 and exterior form degree p\u03be , p\u03b7 , respectively, commute in the\nfollowing graded sense\n\u03b7 \u2227 \u03be = (\u22121)\u03b5\u03be \u03b5\u03b7 +p\u03be p\u03b7 \u03be \u2227 \u03b7\ninside the exterior algebra. We will often not write exterior wedges \"\u2227\" nor tensor multiplications\n\"\u2297\" explicitly. Covariant and exterior derivatives will always be from the left, while partial\nderivatives can be from either left or right. We shall sometimes use round parenthesis \"( )\" to\nindicate how far derivatives act, see e.g., equations (2.1) and (11.1).\n\n\fThree Natural Generalizations of Fedosov Quantization\n\n2\n\n3\n\nBasic settings and assumptions\n\nConsider a manifold M with local coordinates xi of Grassmann-parity \u03b5i \u2261 \u03b5(xi ).

The tensor\nmij = mij (x; h\u0304)\ncan in principle be a formal power series in Planck's constant h\u0304. (The quantum corrections to\nmij do not enter actively into the classical boundary condition (2.1), but they will nevertheless\naffect the Fedosov implementation of the \u2217 multiplication at higher orders in h\u0304, as we shall see\nin equation (7.1) below.) Usually one demands [8] that the classical unit function 1 \u2208 C \u221e (M )\nserves as a unit for the full quantum algebra (A00 , +, \u2217):\nf \u2208 C \u221e (M )[[h\u0304]] \u2261 A00 .\n\nf \u2217 1 = 1 \u2217 f = f,\n\n(2.2)\n\n(The notation A00 will be explained in Section 4.) Let mT denote the transposed tensor,\n(mT )ij := (\u22121)\u03b5i \u03b5j mji .\nIt will be necessary to assume that the antisymmetric part\n\u03c9 ij :=\n\n\u0001\n1 ij\nm \u2212 (mT )ij = \u2212(\u22121)\u03b5i \u03b5j \u03c9 ji\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nof the tensor mij is non-degenerate, i.e., that there exists an inverse matrix \u03c9ij such that\n\u03c9ij \u03c9 jk = \u03b4ik .\n(Note that this does not necessarily imply that mij itself has to be non-degenerate.) Next, let\nthere be given a torsion-free connection \u2207 : \u0393(T M ) \u00d7 \u0393(T M )[[h\u0304]] \u2192 \u0393(T M )[[h\u0304]] that preserves\nthe m-tensor\n(\u2207m) = 0.\n\n(2.4)\n\nIn local coordinates, the covariant derivative \u2207X along a vector field X = X i \u2202il is given as [12]\n\u2207X = X i \u2207i ,\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2202l\nj\nr k\ndx\n.\n+\n\u2202\n\u0393\n\u2207i =\nij\nk\n\u2202xi\n\n(2.5)\n\nEquivalently, \u2207 = d + \u0393 = dxi \u2297 \u2207i : \u0393(T M ) \u2192 \u0393(T \u2217 M \u2297 T M ), where\n\u2192\n\n\u0393 = dxi \u2297 \u2202kr \u0393k ij dxj .\n\n(2.6)\n\n\f4\n\nK. Bering\n\nHere \u2202ir \u2261 (\u22121)\u03b5i \u2202il are not usual partial derivatives. In particular, they do not act on the\nChristoffel symbols \u0393k ij in equations (2.5) and (2.6). Rather they are a dual basis to the\n\u2192\n\none-forms dxi :\n\u2192\n\ndxi (\u2202jr ) = \u03b4ji .\nPhrased differently, the \u2202ir are merely bookkeeping devices, that transform as right partial\nderivatives under general coordinate transformations. (To be able to distinguish them from true\npartial derivatives, the differentiation variable xi on a true partial derivative \u2202/\u2202xi is written\nexplicitly.) The assumption (2.4) reads in local coordinates\n\u0012 \u2192l\n\u0013\n\u2202\njk\nm\n0 = (\u2207i m ) =\n+ \u0393i j n mnk + (\u22121)\u03b5j (\u03b5k +\u03b5n ) \u0393i k n mjn ,\n\u2202xi\njk\n\nwhere we have introduced a reordered Christoffel symbol\n\u0393i k j := (\u22121)\u03b5i \u03b5k \u0393k ij .\nNote that the connection \u2207 will also preserve the transposed tensor mT , and therefore, by linearity, the antisymmetric part \u03c9 ij . We shall later explain why it is crucial that the connection \u2207\nis torsion-free, see comment after equation (16.1). The Christoffel symbols \u0393k ij = \u0393k ij (x; h\u0304) for\nthe connection \u2207 is allowed to be a formal power series in Planck's constant h\u0304. Finally, we\nmention that one traditionally imposes a reality/hermiticity condition on the connection \u2207,\nthe multiplicative structure mij and the \u2217 product. However, we shall for simplicity skip the\nreality/hermiticity condition in this paper.\n\n3\n\nThe two-form \u03c9 is symplectic\n\nThe inverse matrix \u03c9ij with lower indices has the following graded skewsymmetry\n\u03c9ij = (\u22121)(\u03b5i +1)(\u03b5j +1) \u03c9ji ,\n\n(3.1)\n\ncf. equation (2.3). That equation (3.1) should be counted as an skewsymmetry (as opposed to\na symmetry) is perhaps easiest to see by defining the slightly modified matrix\n\u03c9\u0303ij := \u03c9ij (\u22121)\u03b5j .\nNote that the two matrices \u03c9ij and \u03c9\u0303ij are identical for bosonic manifolds. Then the equation (3.1) translates into the more familiar type of graded antisymmetry,\n\u03c9\u0303ij = \u2212(\u22121)\u03b5i \u03b5j \u03c9\u0303ji .\nThe skewsymmetry means that the inverse matrix can be viewed as a two-form\n\u0010^\n\u0011\n1\n1\n2\n(T \u2217 M ) [[h\u0304]] \u2261 A20 .\n\u03c9 := ci \u03c9ij cj = \u2212 cj ci \u03c9\u0303ij \u2208 \u0393\n2\n2\nHere\nci \u2261 dxi\nis the usual basis of one-forms, and\n\u2192\n\u2202l\nd := c\n\u2202xi\ni\n\n(3.2)\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fThree Natural Generalizations of Fedosov Quantization\n\n5\n\ndenotes the de Rham exterior derivative on M .

Bering\n\nIt is easy to show that every symplectic manifold (M ; \u03c9) has a torsion-free \u03c9-preserving connection \u2207, see Section 2.5 in [24] for the bosonic case. However, it is not true that every manifold\n(M ; m) with a multiplicative structure mij supports a torsion-free m-preserving connection \u2207,\ncf. assumption equation (2.4). The symmetric part\n1\ngij := (mij + (mT )ij ) = (\u22121)\u03b5i \u03b5j gji\n2\nof the tensor mij needs to be compatible with the symplectic structure \u03c9 in a certain sense. In\nthe special case where gij = 0, we return to the usual Fedosov quantization mij = \u03c9 ij , which\ncorresponds to a Weyl/symmetric type \u2217 product. In the generic case where g ij has full rank,\nthere will exist an inverse matrix gij , which constitute a (pseudo) Riemannian metric, and there\nwill hence exist a corresponding unique Levi-Civita connection \u2207LC . In this non-degenerate case,\njk\nthe necessary and sufficient conditions are \u2207 = \u2207LC and (\u2207LC\ni \u03c9 ) = 0. This is for instance\nsatisfied for (pseudo) K\u00e4hler manifolds (M ; \u03c9; g), cf.

In terms of\nChristoffel symbols it is easiest to work with expression (12.2):\nRn,ijk := \u03c9nm Rm ijk (\u22121)\u03b5k\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2192l\n\u2202\n\u03b5m (\u03b5i +\u03b5n +1)+\u03b5k\nm\n\u03b5i \u03b5n\n\u0393n,jk + (\u22121)\n\u0393m,in \u0393 jk \u2212 (\u22121)\u03b5i \u03b5j (i \u2194 j).\n= (\u22121)\n\u2202xi\n\n(12.5)\n\nIn the second equality of equation (12.5) we have use the symplectic condition (3.4).

In this formalism the connection \u2207i is supposed\nto act on ck \u2261 dxk , so the torsion-term (12.3) is included in the curvature two-form (13.1). In the\nfourth equality of equation (13.1) we use the torsion-free condition (3.6) and the first Bianchi\nidentity for a torsion-free connection\nX\n0=\n(\u22121)\u03b5i \u03b5k Rijk n\n(13.2)\ni,j,k cycl.\n\nto ensure that the x- and c-derivative term in equation (13.1) vanishes. As we shall see below,\nit is vital that there is no x- and c-derivative term in the R curvature (13.1). This is the\nmain reason why the connection \u2207 is assumed to be torsion-free. (See also the comment after\nequation (16.1).) The first Bianchi identity (13.2) also implies that the Hamiltonian curvature\ntwo-form R is \u03b4-closed:\n(\u03b4R) =\n\n1 k j i\nc c c Rij,kn y n (\u22121)\u03b5n = 0.\n2\n\nSimilarly, the second Bianchi identity for a torsion-free connection\nX\n0=\n(\u22121)\u03b5j \u03b5k \u2207k Rij n m\ni,j,k cycl.\n\nimplies that the \u2207 operator preserves the Hamiltonian curvature two-form R:\n1\n(\u2207R) = cj ci ck (\u2207k Rij,nm)y m y n (\u22121)\u03b5n +\u03b5m = 0.\n4\n\n14\n\nHigher-order D connection\n\nWe next deform the linear \u2207 connection from equation (4.4) into a higher-order connection\nD : \u0393(T M )[[h\u0304]] \u00d7 A \u2192 A,\nD := \u2207 \u2212 \u03b4 +\n\nX (n)\n1\n1 \u25e6\n[r , * ] = \u2207 + [r\u2212\u031f \u25e6, * ] =\nD,\nih\u0304\nih\u0304\nn\u2265\u22121\n\n(n)\n\ndeg( D ) = n,\n\n\fThree Natural Generalizations of Fedosov Quantization\n\n13\n\nwith the help of a so-called deformation one-form\nr = \u2295n\u22650 r(n) \u2208 A1\u2022 ,\n\ndeg(r(n) ) = n.\n\nAs we soon shall see, it is better to think of D as a deformation of (minus) the Koszul\u2013Tate\ndifferential \u03b4 rather than the connection \u2207. The word \"higher-order\" refers to that D is not\nnecessarily a linear derivation of the tensor algebra (A, +, \u2297), cf. equation (4.5). However, it\nis a linear derivation of the \u25e6 algebra (A, +, \u25e6), similar to equations (7.2) and (10.3).

Also note that it will be necessary to\nassume that the (1)-sector vanishes\nr(1) = 0\nto ensure that (minus) the Koszul\u2013Tate differential \u03b4 is the sole leading term in the D expansion (14.1).\n\n15\n\nThe RD curvature\n\nThe curvature two-form RD for the D connection is\n\u00132\n\u0012\n1\nRD := D 2 = \u2207 + [r\u2212\u031f \u25e6, * ]\nih\u0304\n1\n1\n1\n[r\u2212\u031f \u25e6, [r\u2212\u031f \u25e6, * ]] = [RD \u25e6, * ],\n= \u22072 + [\u2207(r\u2212\u031f) \u25e6, * ] +\nih\u0304\n(ih\u0304)2\nih\u0304\n\n(15.1)\n\nwhere the Hamiltonian RD is\nRD := R + \u2207(r\u2212\u031f) +\n\n1\n1\n[r\u2212\u031f \u25e6, r\u2212\u031f] = R + (\u2207 \u2212 \u03b4)r +\n[r \u25e6, r] \u2212 \u03c9.\n2ih\u0304\n2ih\u0304\n\n(15.2)\n\nIn the third and fourth equality of equation (15.1) we use that \u2207 respects the \u25e6 product (7.2)\nand the Jacobi identity for the \u25e6 product, respectively. In the second equality of equation (15.2)\nwe use that (\u2207\u031f) = 0, \u03b4 = {\u031f, *} and {\u031f, \u031f} = \u22122\u03c9.\n\n16\n\nFlat/nilpotent D connection\n\nThe next main principle of Fedosov quantization is to choose the D connection to be flat, or\nequivalently, nilpotent:\n1\nRD \u2261 D 2 \u2261 [D, D] = 0.\n2\n\n(16.1)\n\n\f14\n\nK. Bering\n\nIn other words, the odd D operator is a deformation of the odd Koszul\u2013Tate differential \u03b4,\nsuch that the nilpotency is preserved, cf. equations (10.2) and (16.1). (This setup is similar to\nthe construction of an odd nilpotent BRST operator [29, 7, 27, 1, 2, 25, 35].) Since we want\nto achieve the nilpotency (16.1), it now becomes clear why it was so important that the xand c-derivative terms in the R curvature two-form (13.1) vanish. This is because there are\nno other x- and c-derivatives in the RD curvature two-form (15.1) to cancel them. (All other\nderivatives in equation (15.1) are y-derivatives.) This crucial point is the main reason that the\n\u2207 connection is assumed to be torsion-free. (References [38, 37] consider a hybrid model where\ntorsion is allowed in the y-sector but not in the c-sector to avoid the x- and c-derivatives. Note,\nhowever, that they restrict the possible torsion by imposing both the independent conditions\n(\u2207i \u03c9\u0303jk ) = 0 and (d\u03c9) = 0 at the same time.) For the curvature two-form RD to be zero, it is\nenough to let the Hamiltonian curvature two-form RD be Abelian, i.e., to let it belong to the\ncenter\n\u0010^\n\u0011\n\u2022\nZ(A) := {a \u2208 A | [A \u25e6, a] = 0} = {a \u2208 A | {A, a} = 0} = A\u20220 \u2261 \u0393\n(T \u2217 M ) [[h\u0304]]\nof the algebra (A, +, \u25e6). In other words, there should exist an Abelian two-form C \u2208 A20 , such\nthat\nRD = \u2212C \u2212 \u03c9 \u2208 A20 .\n\n(16.2)\n\nHere \u03c9 is just the symplectic two-form (3.3) itself. (Recall that \u03c9 trivially belongs to the\ncenter Z(A). The signs and the shift with \u03c9 in equation (16.2) are introduced without loss of\ngenerality for later convenience.) The Abelian condition (16.2) turns into Fedosov's r-equation\n(\u03b4r) = R + C + (\u2207r) +\n\n1\n[r \u25e6, r].\n2ih\u0304\n\n(16.3)\n\nTheorem 1 (Fedosov's 1st theorem).

As a consequence, it turns out that the first three sectors r(0) , r(1) and r(2)\nare identically zero.\n\n\fThree Natural Generalizations of Fedosov Quantization\n\n15\n\nProof .

The\nequation (16.7) is therefore automatically satisfied. It follows from equation (16.5) that\n0 = \u03b4\u2217 r(0) = y i \u03b7i (x).\nTherefore the (0)-sector\nr(0) = 0\nvanishes identically. Equation (16.8) with n = 0 is automatically satisfied because of the two\nboundary conditions (16.4) and (16.6). Putting n = 1 in equation (16.8) yields \u03b4r(2) = 0. Hence\nthe (2)-sector r(2) is a one-form that is both \u03b4-closed and \u03b4\u2217 -closed, and therefore it must be\nidentically zero as well:\nr(2) = 0.\nSince r(0) , r(1) and r(2) are zero, the right-hand side expression for \u03b4r(n+1) in equation (16.8)\nwill only depend on previous entries r(\u2264n) . Hence equation (16.8) is a recursive relation. The\nconsistency relation for the Abelian condition (16.3) is that the right-hand side should be \u03b4closed. This is indeed the case:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n\u25e6\n[r , r] = \u03b4R + [\u03b4, \u2207]r \u2212 \u2207(\u03b4r) + [\u03b4r \u25e6, r] = \u2212D(\u03b4r)\n\u03b4(RHS) = \u03b4 R + C + \u2207r +\n2ih\u0304\nih\u0304\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n1\n1\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n= \u2212\u2207 R + C + \u2207r +\n[r , r] +\n[r , r] , r = 0. (16.9)\nR + C + \u2207r +\n2ih\u0304\nih\u0304\n2ih\u0304\nIn the second equality of equation (16.9) we have used that \u03b4 respects the \u25e6 product. In the\nthird equality we have used that (\u03b4R) = 0, that [\u03b4, \u2207] = 0, and that \u03b4 is nilpotent. In the fifth\n(=last) equality we have used that (\u2207R) = 0, that (dC) = 0, that \u22072 = {R, *}, that \u2207 respects\nthe \u25e6 product, and the Jacobi identity for the \u25e6 product.\nWe now prove by induction on the Fedosov degree (n) that there exists a unique solution r(n+1)\nto equation (16.8) if there exists a unique solution for all the previous entries r(\u2264n) . This is\nessentially a consequence of the Poincar\u00e9 lemma 1. Uniqueness: The difference\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2206r(n+1) := r(n+1)\n\u2212 r(n+1)\n\n\f16\n\nK.

Hence the difference \u2206r(n+1) is a one-form that\nis both \u03b4-closed and \u03b4\u2217 -closed, and therefore it must be identically zero. Existence: Define\n\nr(n+1) := \u03b4\u22121 (RHS(n) )\n\nfor\n\nn \u2265 0,\n\nwhere RHS(n) is the two-form valued right-hand side of equation (16.8). This clearly defines\na \u03b4\u2217 -closed one-form r(n+1) . To check equation (16.8), it is enough to check that the two-form\nRHS(n) is \u03b4-closed. But this follows by linearity from the consistency relation (16.9), because \u2207\nand \u25e6 both carry positive Fedosov degree, and the first three r-sectors vanish to cancel the\nnegative Fedosov degree coming from the h\u0304\u22121 -factor, so that only previous entries r(\u2264n) can\nparticipate to the (n)-sector.\n\u0004\nWe emphasize that the unique deformation one-form r from Fedosov's 1st theorem is globally well-defined, since it basically appeared from inverting the Koszul\u2013Tate \u03b4 differential, cf.\nSection 11. Normally, one would choose a trivial Abelian two-form C \u2261 0. Also note that the\ntwo-form R + C is the lone source term that forces r to be non-trivial. We list here the first\nfew unique r-terms:\n\u0001\nr(0) = 0,\nr(1) = 0,\nr(2) = 0,\nr(3) = \u03b4\u22121 R(2) + C(2) ,\n(0)\n\u0001\nr(4) = \u03b4\u22121 \u2207 r(3) ,\n....\nSimilarly, the first few terms in the D expansion read\n(\u22121)\n\nD = \u2212\u03b4,\n\n17\n\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nD=\u2207,\n\n(1)\n\nD=\n\n1\n[r \u25e6, * ](0) ,\nih\u0304 (3)\n\n....\n\nHorizontal sections\n\nFedosov's 1st theorem establishes the existence of a globally well-defined, unique, flat/nilpotent D connection. Since this higher-order connection D is flat, it is possible to solve the\nhorizontal condition (Da) = 0 locally for a zero-form valued section a \u2208 A0\u2022 . (In other words,\nthe flatness relation (16.1) is the local consistency relation for the horizontal condition.) As\nwe shall see below there is no obstruction in patching together local horizontal sections a into\nglobal horizontal sections, basically because D is a deformation of (minus) the Koszul\u2013Tate\n\u03b4-differential.\nTheorem 2 (Fedosov's 2nd theorem).

First note that that a zero-form a \u2208 A0\u2022 is automatically \u03b4\u2217 -closed:\n(\u03b4\u2217 a) \u2261 0,\n\na \u2208 A0\u2022 .\n\n(17.1)\n\n\fThree Natural Generalizations of Fedosov Quantization\n\n17\n\nThe horizontal condition (Da) = 0 becomes\n(\u03b4a) = (\u2207a) +\n\n1 \u25e6\n[r , a].\nih\u0304\n\n(17.2)\n\nLet us split the horizontal condition (17.2) in Fedosov degree:\n\u03b4a(0) \u2261 0,\n\u03b4a(n+1)\n\nk+l\u2264n+2\nn (n\u2212k)\nX\n1 X\n[r(k) \u25e6, a(l) ](n+2\u2212k\u2212l)\n=\n\u2207 a(k) +\nih\u0304\n\nfor\n\nn \u2265 0.\n\n(17.3)\n\n0\u2264k,l\n\nk=0\n\nNote that the right-hand side expression for \u03b4a(n+1) only depends on previous entries a(\u2264n) ,\nbecause r(0) , r(1) and r(2) are zero. Hence equation (17.3) is a recursive relation. The consistency\nrelation for the horizontal condition (17.2) is that the right-hand side should be \u03b4-closed. This\nis indeed the case:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u25e6\n1\n1\n\u03b4(RHS) = \u03b4 \u2207a + [r , a] = [\u03b4, \u2207]a \u2212 \u2207(\u03b4a) \u2212 [r \u25e6, \u03b4a] + [\u03b4r \u25e6, a]\nih\u0304\nih\u0304\nih\u0304\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n1\n1\n= \u2212\u2207 \u2207a + [r \u25e6, a] \u2212\nr \u25e6, \u2207a + [r \u25e6, a]\nih\u0304\nih\u0304\nih\u0304\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n1\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n+\n[r , r] , a = 0.\n(17.4)\nR + C + \u2207r +\nih\u0304\n2ih\u0304\nIn the second equality of equation (17.4) we have used that \u03b4 respects the \u25e6 product. In the\nthird equality we have used that [\u03b4, \u2207] = 0. In the fourth (=last) equality we have used that\n\u22072 = {R, *}, that \u2207 respects the \u25e6 product, and the Jacobi identity for the \u25e6 product.\nWe now prove by induction on the Fedosov degree (n) that there exists a unique solution\na(n+1) to equation (17.3) if there exists a unique solution for all the previous entries a(\u2264n) . This\nis essentially a consequence of the Poincar\u00e9 lemma 1. Uniqueness: The difference\n\u2206a(n+1) := a\u2032(n+1) \u2212 a\u2032\u2032(n+1)\nbetween two solutions a\u2032(n+1) and a\u2032\u2032(n+1) must satisfy the homogeneous versions \u03b4(\u2206a(n+1) ) = 0\nand \u2206a(n+1)00 = 0 of the horizontal condition (17.3) and boundary condition (17.1), i.e., with no\nright-hand sides. Hence the difference \u2206a(n+1) is both \u03b4-closed, \u03b4\u2217 -closed and with no 00-sector.\nTherefore it must be identically zero. Existence: Define\na(0) := f(0) ,\na(n+1) := f(n+1) + \u03b4\u22121 (RHS(n) )\n\nfor n \u2265 0,\n\nwhere RHS(n) is the one-form valued right-hand side of equation (17.3). This clearly defines\na zero-form a(n+1) that satisfies the boundary condition (17.1). To check equation (17.3), it is\nenough to check that the one-form RHS(n) is \u03b4-closed. But this follows by linearity from the\nconsistency relation (17.4), because \u2207 and \u25e6 both carry positive Fedosov degree, and the first\nthree r-sectors vanish to cancel the negative Fedosov degree coming from the h\u0304\u22121 -factor, so that\nonly previous entries a(\u2264n) can participate to the (n)-sector.\n\u0004\nWe list here the solution to the unique first-order correction a(1) :\na(1) \u2212 f(1) = \u03b4\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2192l\n\u2202\nf\n,\n( \u2207 a(0) ) = y\n\u2202xi (0)\n(0)\n\ni\n\nwhich we'll use in the next Section 18.\n\n\f18\n\n18\n\nK. Bering\n\nThe \u2217 product\n\nFedosov's 2nd theorem establishes an isomorphism\nQ\n\n(A00 , +, \u2217) \u220b f 7\u2192 Q(f ) \u2208 (WD , +, \u25e6)\n\n(18.1)\n\nbetween the algebra A00 of quantum functions (=symbols),\nA00 = C \u221e (M )[[h\u0304]] = {a \u2208 A | (\u03b4a) = 0 = (\u03b4\u2217 a)},\nand the algebra of zero-form valued horizontal sections,\nWD := {a \u2208 A0\u2022 | (Da) = 0}.\nThat the vector space (WD , +, \u25e6) is an subalgebra, i.e., closed with respect to the \u25e6 product,\nfollows basically because the connection \u2207 respects the \u25e6 product, cf. equation (7.2). The \u2217\nproduct in diagram (18.1) is by definition induced from the \u25e6 product as\nf \u2217 g := Q\u22121 (Q(f ) \u25e6 Q(g)) .\nThis \u2217 product obviously inherits associativity from the \u25e6 product, and the Q map (18.1) is\nobviously an algebra isomorphism. Moreover, the inverse map\nQ\u22121\n\n(WD , +, \u25e6) \u220b a 7\u2192 a|y=0 \u2261 a00 \u2208 (A00 , +, \u2217)\nis simply the restriction to y = 0, cf. boundary condition (17.1). It remains to check that the\nclassical boundary condition (2.1) holds. Let us first expand to the appropriate orders:\nQ(f ) = a(0) + a(1) + a(2) + O(h\u03042 , yh\u0304, y 3 ),\nQ(g) = b(0) + b(1) + b(2) + O(h\u03042 , yh\u0304, y 3 ),\n\u2190\n\u2192\nih\u0304\n\u2202 r jk \u2202 l\nQ(f ) \u25e6 Q(g) = Q(f )Q(g) + Q(f ) j m\nQ(g) + O(h\u03042 ).\n2\n\u2202y\n\u2202y k\nTherefore\nlim f \u2217 g = f(0) g(0) ,\n\nh\u0304\u21920\n\n(18.2)\n\n\u2192\n\u2190\na(2) |y=0\nb(2) |y=0 1\nf \u2217 g \u2212 f(0) g(0)\n\u2202 r jk \u2202 l\n=\nb(0) + a(0)\n+ a(1) j m(0) k b(1) ,\nlim\nh\u0304\u21920\nih\u0304\nih\u0304\nih\u0304\n2\n\u2202y\n\u2202y\nor equivalently,\n\u2190\n\u2192\n1\n\u2202 r jk \u2202 l\nf \u2217 g \u2212 fg\n= f(0) j m(0) k g(0) .\nlim\nh\u0304\u21920\nih\u0304\n2\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\n(18.3)\n\nEquations (18.2) and (18.3) are precisely the content of the classical boundary condition (2.1).\nIt is also easy to check condition (2.2).\nNote added.

This paper presents the Fedosov construction in a fairly general framework. It is generally known that the tensor need not be skew-symmetric as long as its skewsymmetric part is non-degenerate, can be a series in the deformation parameter, and that Fedosov's construction has also been extended to the case of super-manifolds. However it appears\nfrom the last reports that there is a point in publishing the unified presentation of the author,\nwhich should be viewed as a good review of Fedosov's construction in a quite general context,\neven if the author overemphasizes somewhat the importance of the generalizations he considers.\n\nReferences\n[1] Batalin I.A., Fradkin E.S., A generalized canonical formalism and quantization of reducible gauge theories,\nPhys.
