The original motivation was to study possible superconductivity\nin the Fermions. In these systems, the Fermions are essentially non-interacting. From the\nFermi exclusion principle, no two Fermions can be at the same place, the s-wave scattering between them cannot occur. As a result, evaporative cooling of the Fermions alone\nis ineffective. To evaporatively cooled the Fermions the Bosons were used as a refrigerant\nexperimentally. Much of the current theoretical interest is focused on estimating the possible superconducting properties of the Fermion system. Nevertheless, mixtures of Bosons\nand Fermions are interesting in their own right. Modugno and coworkers[5] recently studied\nmixtures of 40 K and 87 Rb with an attractive interaction between the Boson and Fermion and\nfound that as the number of Boson is increased there is a \"instability value\" NBc at which\na discontinuous leakage of the Boson and Fermion occurs. They observed a first order\ncollapse transition of the Boson and Fermion clouds. This paper explores the origin and the\nnature of this collapse transition. The nature of the transition depends on the higher order\nterm of the Boson interaction. Because there is no direct interaction between the Fermions,\nit is possible to formally exactly integrate out their degree of freedom in their finite temperature partition function. The final result can be expanded as a power series in the\nBoson density. An effective interaction between the Bosons is obtained. We found that the\npairwise effective interaction can become attractive for a large enough number of Bosons\nand at a sufficiently low temperature and the Boson cloud collapses. This is analogous to\nearlier experiments with fixed attractive Boson interaction[6] where the Boson cloud also\ncollapses. In the present case, the effective interaction depends on the atom densities and\ncan change during the collapse. In addition, in contrast to the one component case, the\nBoson interaction involve powers of the Boson density higher than the second. The leading\nnonlinear interaction term is proportional to an odd (third) power of the Boson density\n(n3B ) with a negative coefficient. As a result the transition is discontinuous and physical\nquantities change discontinuously. Using the experimental parameters, we estimate the\ninstability Boson number NBc for the Boson cloud to collapse. We found NBc to be extremely sensitive to the precise value of the Boson Fermion scattering length aBF . For\nNf = 2 \u00d7 104, NBc \u2248 105 when aBF \u2248 \u221216.7nm, in good agreement with experimental\nresults.\n2\n\n\fThe Boson-Fermion system may also exhibit a superconducting transition. The Boson\ninduced Fermi interaction is attractive and thus the superconducting transition always occurs\nat zero temperature. The superconducting transition temperature for the Fermions is usually\nvery low, because it is an exponential function of the dimensionless coupling constant\na: Tsc = TF exp(\u22121/a). As a result the superconducting transition is difficult to observe\nexperimentally. Thus it is important to know if the same difficulty applies to the collapse\ntransition. The renormalized Boson interaction can change from attractive to repulsive at\na sufficiently high temperature. A phase diagram of NBc as a function of the temperature\nT is worked out. We found that the collapse transition is much easier to observe than the\nsuperconducting transition. A possible interpretation of the observation of Modugno and\ncoworkers from the above picture is as follows: As a result of the Fermion-Boson attraction,\nthe collapse transition will happen to both the Boson and the Fermion. When the density\nis high enough, they disappear from the trap. If the amount of Fermion is smaller than the\nBosons, they will be gone first. Once the Fermion density is small enough, the Bosons will\nstop collapsing. We now discuss our results in detail.\nWe first integrate out the Fermion degrees of freedom in the path integral for the system.\nOur starting point is the functional-integral representation of the grand-canonical partition\nfunction of the Bose-Fermi mixture. It has the form [7, 8, 9, 10]:\nZ=\n\nZ\n\n1\nD[\u03c6 ]D[\u03c6]D[\u03c8 ]D[\u03c8] exp \u2212 (SB (\u03c6\u2217 , \u03c6) + SF (\u03c8 \u2217 , \u03c8) + Sint (\u03c6\u2217 , \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2217, \u03c8)) .\nh\u0304\n\u2217\n\n\u001b\n\n\u001a\n\n\u2217\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c6(\u03c4, r) describes the Bose component of the mixture, whereas \u03c8(\u03c4, r) corresponds to the\nFermi component. This integral consists of an integration over a complex field \u03c6(\u03c4, r), which\nis periodic on the imaginary-time interval [0, h\u0304\u03b2], and over the Grassmann field \u03c8(\u03c4, r),\nwhich is antiperiodic on this interval. The term describing the Bose-gas has the form:\nSB (\u03c6\u2217 , \u03c6) =\n\nR h\u0304\u03b2\n0\n\nd\u03c4\n\nR\n\nn\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2202\ndr \u03c6\u2217 (\u03c4, r) h\u0304 \u2202\u03c4\n\u2212\n\nh\u03042 \u22072\n2mB\n\n\u0011\n\n+ VB (r) \u2212 \u03bcB \u03c6(\u03c4, r) +\n\ngB\n|\u03c6(\u03c4, r)|4\n2\n\no\n\n. Because\n\nthe Pauli principle forbids s-wave scattering between fermionic atoms in the same hyperfine state, the Fermi-gas term can be written in the noninteracting form: SF (\u03c8 \u2217 , \u03c8) =\nR h\u0304\u03b2\n\nd\u03c4\n\ngBF\n\nR h\u0304\u03b2\n\n0\n\nR\n\nn\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2202\n\u2212\ndr \u03c8 \u2217 (\u03c4, r) h\u0304 \u2202\u03c4\n\nh\u03042 \u22072\n2mF\n\n\u0011\n\no\n\n+ VF (r) \u2212 \u03bcF \u03c8(\u03c4, r) . The term describing the interac-\n\ntion between the two components of the Fermi-Bose mixture is: Sint (\u03c6\u2217 , \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2217 , \u03c8) =\n0\n\nd\u03c4\n\nR\n\ndr|\u03c8(\u03c4, r)|2|\u03c6(\u03c4, r)|2, where gB = 4\u03c0h\u03042 aB /mB and gBF = 2\u03c0h\u03042 aBF /mI , mI =\n\nmB mF /(mB + mF ).\nThe integral over the Fermi fields \u03c8 is Gaussian. We can calculate this integral and obtain\n3\n\n\fthe partition function of the Fermi system as a functional of the Bose field \u03c6(\u03c4, r). To proceed we rewrite the partition function as Z =\n\nR\n\nn\n\no\n\nD[\u03c6\u2217 ]D[\u03c6]ZF exp \u2212 h\u03041 (SB (\u03c6\u2217 , \u03c6)) .

The properties of the Fermions can also be calculated. For example, the Fermion density can be calculated from the functional derivative\n< \u03c8 \u2217 (r)\u03c8(r) >=< \u03b4ZF /\u03b4G\u22121 (\u03c4, r, \u03c4, r) >. To illustrate the applicability of this result, we\nconsider its contribution to the effective interaction between the Bosons.\nIn the absence of the Fermions, the Boson wave function can be represented as a\nwave function \u03c60 which is given in the Thomas-Fermi approximation by |\u03c60 |2 = (\u03bcB \u2212\n0.5mB \u03c9B2 (x2 + y 2 + \u03bb2 z 2 ))/gB . Multiboson interaction can be obtained from an expansion\n\nof ln(\u2212G\u22121 ) in powers of the deviation of the boson density from |\u03c60 |2 : |\u03c6|2 = \u03b4|\u03c6|2 + |\u03c60 |2 .\n\nIn this spirit, we write \u03a3 = \u03a30 + \u03b4\u03a3 where \u03a30 (\u03c4, r, \u03c4 \u2032 , r\u2032 ) = gBF |\u03c60 (\u03c4, r)|2 \u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032 )\u03b4(\u03c4 \u2212\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03c4 \u2032 )/h\u0304.The corresponding Green's function is defined as G\u22121\n=\n0 = GF \u2212 \u03a30 .We have G\n\u22121\n\u22121\nG\u22121\n)) = T r(ln(\u2212G\u22121\n0 \u2212 \u03b4\u03a3 = G0 (I \u2212 G0 \u03b4\u03a3), T r(ln(\u2212G\n0 )) \u2212\n\n\u2212\n\nP\u221e\n\nn=0 Sn /h\u0304.The\n\nP\u221e\n\nn=1\n\nT r[(G0 \u03b4\u03a3)n ]/n =\n\npair interaction comes from the term S2 = T r(G0 \u03b4\u03a3)2 /2. The result-\n\ning expression can be evaluated in the Thomas-Fermi approximation and assuming that\nthe Fermions move faster than the Bose condensates.\n\nTo illustrate our approach we\n\nconsider the term S1 = T r(G0 \u03b4\u03a3).

As usual,\n\u03bcF can be determined from the equation NF = drnF (r).\nR\n\nModugno and coworkers[5] recently studied mixtures of\n\n40\n\nK and\n\n87\n\nRb with an attractive\n\ninteraction between the Boson and Fermion and found a collapse of the Fermion cloud.\nThe parameters of the system are the following: aB = 50\u00c5, aBF = \u2212217+48\n\u221243 \u00c5, the aspect\n5\n\n\fratio of the trapping potential, \u03bb = 0.076. The corresponding Fermi wave vector is kF =\n7.7 \u00d7 10\u22124 /\u00c5, and TF \u2248 360nK when the number of Fermions, Nf \u2248 2 \u00d7 104 .\nEq. (5) looks like a typical Landau free energy expansion of a system with order parameter\nO = \u03b4|\u03c6|2 in a weak external field Vef f . As we learn from the study of critical phenomena, an\ninstability occurs when coefficient of the O 2 term becomes zero. This instability condition\n2\nof gef f = 0 imposes a condition on \u03bc\u0303. Now gef f (r = 0) = gB \u2212gBF\n\u03ba3 (\u03bcF \u2212gBF \u03bcB /gB )1/2 [12].\n\nWith the Thomas-Fermi approximation \u03bcB = (mB \u03c9B2 )3/5 (15NB gB /4\u03c0\u03bb)2/5 /2. Substituting\n\nthis expression of \u03bcB into the equation of gef f (r = 0) = 0, we obtain an estimate of of the\ncritical Boson number NBc for the instability of the system:\n\u0010\n\nNBc = 8\u03c0[(gB \u03c0mI /gBF mF aBF kF \u03b1)2 \u2212 1]\u03bcF d3B (aB /dB )3/5 /gBF\ndB =\n\n\u00115/2\n\n(\u03bb/15).\n\n(11)\n\nq\n\nh\u0304/mb \u03c9b is the transverse harmonic length for the trapping potential of the Bosons.\n\n\u03b1 is a finite temperature correction factor defined after eq. (9). The dependence of NBc on\naBF is extremely sensitive. In Fig. 1 we show NBc as a function of aBF for T /TF = 0.3\nin units of nm. NBc changes by a factor of two when aBF changes by 5 per cent. The\nexperimental value of NBc \u2248 105 suggests that aBF \u2248 \u221216.7nm.\nEven when gef f < 0, there is still a tunnelling barrier for the collapse to occur. This\ntunnelling barrier diappears when gef f = \u2212gc where estimates of gc Nc has been given previously as a function of \u03bb.[13] We have solved this equation iteratively, starting with the\ninitial guess in eq. (28). We found that the corrections to Nc from this condition is less than\n1 per cent.\nWe next address the nature of the phase transition. In previous studies of attractive\none component Bosons, the free energy is a function of only the first and the second power\nof the Boson density. There are no higher power terms. For the present two component\nsystem, the effective Boson interaction involve higher power terms of the Boson density. The\nnature of the transition is determined by these nonlinear terms. We found a term of the\n3\norder of cgBF\n(\u03b4nB )3 in the free energy functional. From Landau type arguments, if an odd\n\norder term with a negative coefficient appears, then at the transition the free energy can be\nfurther lowered by a finite increase of \u03b4nB ; the transition is first order. This is in agreement\nwith the experimental observation of a discontinuous leakage in the number of Bosons and\nFermions. The usual second order phase transition require a leading nonlinear correction of\nthe order of n4B with a positive coefficient and no third order term. This is not the case in\n6\n\n\fthe present system.\nThe experiment was carried out at finite temperatures. Upon increasing the temperature\nthe induced interaction between the Bose particles can change from attractive to repulsive.\nFrom the condition that gef f (T ) = 0, we obtain a phase diagram of NBc as a function of\nT /TF . This is shown in Fig. 2. The current system may also exhibit a superconducting\ntransition. The Boson induced Fermi interaction is attractive at zero temperature. The\nsuperconducting transition temperature for the Fermions is usually very low, because it is\nan exponential function of the dimensional coupling constant a: Tsc = TF exp(\u22121/a). As\na result the superconducting transition is difficult to observe experimentally. The collapsing\ntransition temperature is much higher and do not have this problem.\nRoth[14] has studied the structure of the mixture numerically at zero temperature with\na modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the bosons which self-consistently includes the\nmean-field interaction generated by the fermionic cloud. Numerical results were presented\nfor the instability Boson number NBc as a function of aBF /dB for different values of aB /dB\nfor isotropic traps. It is not possible to compare his results to the experiment because\nhis results are expressed in terms of a single trap length dB whereas the experimental\ntrap is anisotropic and there are two trap lengths that differ by a factor of more than\nthree. When aBF /dB changes by a factor of three, NBc changes by two orders of\nmagnitude.\nViverit and coworkers[15] have discussed an instability criterion based on a linear stability\nanalysis at zero temperature. According to the estimate of ref. (13), the effective coupling for\nthe experimental system is repulsive and far away from the instability point gef f /|gBF | =\n0.055. Furthermore their instability criterion does not involve NB .\nIf the temperature is higher than the Fermi temperature but below the Bose condensation\ntemperature, it is still possible to derive an expression for the effective coupling for the\nBosons. At high temperatures we have the Boltzman limit (e\u2212\u03bc \u0303F /(kB T ) \u226a 1). In this case\nEqs. (6) and (7) take the form:\nVef f\ngef f\n\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n= VB (r) +\ngBF \u03ba3 (kB T )3/2 e\u2212\u03bc\u0303/(kB T ) ,\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c0 2\ngBF \u03ba3 (kB T )1/2 e\u2212\u03bc\u0303/(kB T ) .\n= gB \u2212\n2\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nNow the Fermi energy is replaced by the temperature. As expected, the renormalization\neffect becomes very small.\n7\n\n\fEqs.\n\n(8) and (9) are useful for studying other physical properties of the system.\n\nFor example, for the trapped harmonic potential Ub (r) =\n\n1\nm \u03c9 2(x2\n2 b b\n\n+ y 2 + \u03bb2b z 2 ), the\n\ninteraction-induced fractional shift to the ideal BEC critical temperature is [16] \u2206T0 /T0 \u2192\n\n\u22121.33(abb /db)(\u03bbb Nb )1/6 where Nb is the atom number of Bose particles in the trap. Replacing\nthe parameters with those obtained from eq. (18) and (19), our result provides for an easy\nway to estimate this change in the presence of Fermions.[17]\n\nOur result can also be used to calculate the density distribution of the particles of the\nmixture. Using the standard Thomas-Fermi approximation with the renormalized interaction one can obtain the density of the Bose particles. The Fermi density can then be\nobtained from Eq. (10) for T = 0.\ngef f only depends on the square of the Fermion-Boson interaction gBF . It can become\nnegative for a repulsive gBF > 0. In the case, as the Boson density is increased, the Fermion\ndensity decreases. The system phase separates. After the phase separation is complete gef f\nbecomes positive again. Thus in that case, we can consider a negative gef f to be a signature\nof the instability towards phase separation. The present calculation provides a unified way\nof looking at these two different phenomena.\nIn this paper, we have used a 3D Thomas-Fermi approximation to describe the Fermions.\nThis approximation will break down when the anisotropic quantization of the energy levels\ndue to the anisotropic harmonic potential becomes important. The larger energy scale\ncorresponds to the transverse harmonic frequency and is h\u0304\u03c9F,r = 15.16nK. This value is less\nthan the experimental temperature (Tc = 360nK). We thus expect the anisotropic energy\nquantization effect not to be important in the present case. This quantization effect will be\nimportant in the investigation of possible superconductivity as the temperature involved is\nmuch lower.\nIn conclusion, we show that because there is no direct interaction between the Fermions,\nthe part of the path integral involving the Fermion field can be carried out exactly. A description of the Bosons in increasing powers of its density with renormalized couplings is\nobtained. The Fermion-mediated term can rendered the Boson interaction attractive. When\nthe Fermion-Boson interaction is attractive, the system collapses. We calculate the instability Boson number as a function of temperature and as a function of the Boson-Fermion\nscattering length. The transition temperature is comparable to the Fermi temperature. Becuase of the structure of the leading nonlinear term in the Boson interaction, the transition\n8\n\n\fis first order. This may provide for an explanation of recent experimental results of Modugno\nand coworkers.[5]\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe work was supported in part by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (Grant\nNo 02-02-16622).
