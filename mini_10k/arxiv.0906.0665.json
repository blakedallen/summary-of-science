This is directly related to galaxy formation and the formation\nof the first luminous objects. Observations of redshifted 21-cm radiation from neutral\nhydrogen (HI) is probably the most promising future probe of reionization. Several\napproaches have been proposed to extract information about the epoch of reionization\nfrom the data which is expected to come in near future.\nThe most discussed approach has been to study the global statistical properties of\nthe reionization HI 21-cm. We develop the formalism to calculate the Multi-frequency\nAngular Power Spectrum (MAPS) and quantify the statistics of the HI signal as a\njoint function of the angular multipole l and frequency separation \u2206\u03bd. We adopt a\nsimple model for the HI distribution which incorporates patchy reionization and use it\nto study the signatures of ionized bubbles on MAPS. We also study the implications of\nthe foreground subtraction.\nThis thesis also investigates the possibility of detecting ionized bubbles around individual sources through radio interferometric observations of redshifted HI 21-cm radiation. We present a visibility based matched filter technique to optimally combine\nthe signal from an ionized bubble and minimize the noise and foreground contributions.\nThe formalism makes definite predictions on the ability to detect an ionized bubble or\nconclusively rule out its presence within a radio map. Results are presented for the\nGMRT and the MWA. Using simulated HI maps we analyzed the impact of HI fluctuations outside the bubble on its detectability. Various other issues such as (i) bubble size\ndetermination (ii) blind search for bubbles, (iii) optimum redshift for bubble detection\nare also discussed.\nKey words: cosmology: theory, cosmology:

Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) observations\n(COBE\u2217 , WMAP\u2020 ) give a picture of the early Universe (only \u223c 370, 000 years after the\nBig Bang). During the first \u223c 100000 years, the universe was a fully ionized plasma\nwith a strong coupling caused by the Thomson scattering between photons and electrons. Because of adiabatic expansion, the temperature of the Universe dropped down\nto few thousand Kelvin (\u223c 3000 K) at redshit z \u223c 1100 and the protons and electrons\ncombined for the first time to form neutral Hydrogen (HI) atoms. The scattering of\nphotons reduced and they decoupled from baryonic matter. After this the photons were\nmostly undisturbed except that the expansion of the Universe redshifted them into the\nmicrowave at present. This relic background radiation is known as the CMBR. After\nthe recombination, the Universe became almost neutral with 75% and 25% in weight of\ntotal baryonic matter was in the form of HI and neutral Helium respectively (neutral\nHelium formed earlier than the HI). On the other hand observations of Ly alpha forest\nin quasar (QSO) absorption spectra show the diffuse Hydrogen gas in the Universe to\nbe completely ionized at redshifts z \u2264 5 (Fan et al. (2002))\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nhttp://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/cobe/\nhttp://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n\n1\n\n\f1 Introduction\n\n1.1 The Epoch of Reionization\nThe above two observations suggest that the HI of the Universe was ionized sometime in\nthe redshift range z = 1000 to 5. The period when the HI was ionized is called the Epoch\nof Reionization (EoR). The EoR is one of the least known chapters in the evolutionary\nhistory of the Universe. Its exact timing, duration, nature of the reionizing sources,\ntheir relative contribution to the reionization, large scale distribution and evolution of\nHI are highly unknown. Again, once the first reionizing sources were formed, their\nvarious feedback mechanisms such as mass deposition, energy injection and emitted\nradiation deeply affect subsequent galaxy formation and influence the evolution of the\nIntergalactic Medium (IGM). The epoch of reionization, therefore, can be considered\nas a complicated era which involves a large number of interconnected processes (for a\nreview see Choudhury & Ferrara (2006)). The study reionization has been at the fore\nfont of research over the last few years (Barkana & Loeb (2001); Barkana (2006)).\nThough the EoR is yet to be observed in detail, theorists have proposed possible\npictures of how the reionization took place. The weak density perturbations which\nwere generated during inflation era grew through gravitational instability and lead to\noverdense regions. The first generation of galaxies formed at redshift z \u223c 20 in these\noverdense regions. The gas in these galaxies cooled by molecular cooling and fragmented.\nThen the first generation of stars which are believed to be massive (\u223c 100Mo ) and metal\nfree were created. Enormous amount of radiation produced by these stars ionized the\nsurrounding IGM. Then new generation of galaxies and stars formed. Ionized bubbles\nthus grow and filled the entire space. In another scenario, black hole were created at the\ncenters of galaxies. Enormous amount of x-ray radiation ionized the IGM.\nCurrently two types of experiments give information about the EoR. First, the study\nof Lyman-\u03b1 line absorption in the high redshift QSO spectra has been be used to probe\n\n2\n\n\f1.1 The Epoch of Reionization\nthe ionization state and the HI distribution at high redshifts. The analysis of GunnPeterson troughs (Gunn & Peterson (1965)) in the high redshift QSO absorption spectra\nsuggests that reionization finished around redshift z \u223c 6 (Becker et al. 2001; Fan et al.\n2002; White et al. 2003). The study of the dark gap distribution and its evolution in\nQSO spectra has been shown as an efficient and independent probe of the reionization.\nThis analysis puts an upper limit on the HI fraction xHI < 0.36 at redshift z = 6.3\n(Gallerani et al., 2008). Measurements of the sizes of HII regions around high redshift\nQSOs are also consistent with the above results (Fan et al. (2006)). Another independent constraint comes from CMBR observations. The CMBR photons scatter off free\nelectrons (produced during reionization) which results in the suppression of the intrinsic\ntemperature and polarization anisotropies on angular scale below the horizon at EoR.\nAt the same time a polarization signal is generated at large angular scale. The amplitude and the position of the peak in the polarization angular power spectrum depend\non the reionization redshift. From recent WMAP measurements of the electron scattering optical depth \u03c4e from the temperature-polarization and polarization-polarization\npower spectrum (Page et al. 2007; Dunkley et al. 2008; Komatsu et al. 2008) imply that\nreionization started before z \u223c 10. It thus seems from these two experimental results\nthat the EoR is an extended and complex process which occurred over a redshift range\n6 \u2212 15 (Choudhury & Ferrara 2006a; Fan, Carilli & Keating 2006; Alvarez et al. 2006).\nHowever, there exist limitations of using these observations to study the details of reionization. The Lyman-\u03b1 absorption feature (similarly for Lyman-\u03b2 and Lyman-\u03b3) in QSO\nspectra is not sensitive to the higher neutral fraction of hydrogen (> 0.1). Therefore,\nthese observations can not be used to probe the reionization at its earlier stages. The\nCMBR experiments are sensitive only to the integrated history of the EoR and it may not\nbe useful to study the progress of reionization with redshift. In fact, it has been shown\nthat the CMBR polarization power spectrum is weakly dependent on the details of the\n\n3\n\n\f1 Introduction\nreionization history (Kaplinghat et al. 2003; Hu & Holder 2003; Haiman & Holder 2003;\nColombo 2004), though weak constraints could be obtained from upcoming experiments\nsuch as PLANCK\u2021 .\nSeveral other probes have been discussed in the literature to unveil the reionization\nhistory of the Universe. According to theory we expect QSOs and massive galaxies to\nform in highly overdense regions. Moreover first generation stars which are expected\nto be massive and short lived would produce gamma ray bursts. Observations of high\nredshift QSOs, galaxies and gamma ray bursts could in principle provide a great deal of\ninformation. Though currently available experimental sensitivity is not sufficient enough\nto detect those, future space based experiments like JWST\u00a7 will have enough sensitivity\nto detect those objects.\n\n1.2 21-cm Tomography\nThe interaction between the spins of the proton and the electron in a hydrogen atom in\nits ground state gives rise to two hyperfine states, i.e., the triplet states of parallel spins\nand the singlet state of anti-parallel spins. The triplet state has higher energy than the\nsinglet state. When a hydrogen atom jumps from the triplet to the singlet state it emits\na photon with the wavelength of 21-cm.\nObservations of the redshifted 21 cm line from the EoR is perhaps one of the most\npromising tools for studying the EoR (for recent review see Furlanetto et al. (2006)).\nThe advantage of this probe lies in the fact that the EoR can be probed at any desired\nredshift by appropriately tuning the observation frequency. Since HI is distributed all\nover space these observations have the potential to probe the large scale distribution of\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\n4\n\nhttp://www.rssd.esa.int/Planck/\nhttp://www.jwst.nasa.gov/\n\n\f1.2 21-cm Tomography\nHI. A wealth of information about the EoR can be extracted from these observations.\nUnlike the observations of QSO absorption spectra the redshifted 21 cm radiation does\nnot suffer from saturation because the optical depth for 21 cm radiation is much less\nthan unity.\nThe possibility of observing 21 cm emission from the cosmological structure formation\nwas first recognized by Sunyaev and Zeldovich (1972) and later studied by Hogan & Rees\n(1979), Scott & Rees (1990) and Madau, Meiksin & Rees (, 1997) considering both emission and absorption against the CMBR. More recently, the effect of heating of the HI\ngas and its reionization on 21 cm signal has drawn great deal of attention and has\nbeen studied in detail (Gnedin & Ostriker 1997; Shaver et al. 1999; Tozzi et al. 2000;\nIliev et al. 2002, 2003; Ciardi & Madau 2003; Furlanetto, Sokasian & Hernquist 2004;\nMiralda-Escude 2003; Chen & Miralda-Escude 2004; Cooray & Furlanetto 2005; Cooray\n2005; Mcquinn et al. 2006; Sethi 2005; Salvaterra et al. 2005; Carilli 2006).\nThere could be several approaches in interpreting the data which is expected to\ncome in coming years. Measurements of 21-cm signal in emission averaged over large\narea of sky would provide a direct probe of the evolution of neutral fraction with\nredshift(Shaver et al. (1999); Gnedin & Shaver (2004)). Telescopes are being set up\nto measure this average signal (e.g, Compact Reionization Experiments (CORE) at\nAustralia Telescope National Facility, Experiments to Detect Global EOR Signature\n(EDGES) at MIT Haystack Observatory). Measurements of the HI power spectrum and\nindividual ionized bubble detection are other two major approaches which are discussed\nin the following subsections.\n\n5\n\n\f1 Introduction\n\n1.2.1 Statistical analysis of the 21-cm signal\n\nThe most discussed approach has been to study the global statistical properties of the\nHI distribution through quantities like the power spectrum. The precise measurements\nof the HI 21-cm fluctuations in terms of their multifrequency angular power spectrum\nwould provide a wealth of information of the size, spatial distribution and evolution\nof the ionized regions. This would also help us understand the effect of reionization\non the structure formation, radiative feedback mechanisms in star- forming zones, the\nphysics of the first generation stars, galaxies etc. This approach has been considered\nin the context of lower redshifts (Bharadwaj, Nath & Sethi 2001; Bharadwaj & Sethi\n2001; Bharadwaj & Pandey 2003; Bharadwaj & Srikant 2004). A similar formalism can\nalso be applied at high redshifts to probe reionization and also the pre-reionization era\n(Zaldarriaga, Furlanetto & Hernquist 2004; Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga & Hernquist 2004b;\nBharadwaj & Ali 2004, 2005; Bharadwaj & Pandey 2005; Ali, Bharadwaj and Pandey\n2005, 2006; Loeb & Zaldarriaga 2004; He et al. 2004). It is expected that the radiation\nfrom first generation luminous objects changes the character of the 21 cm sky completely.\nDuring this epoch, an unique signature of ionized regions will be imprinted on the\nredshifted 21 cm signal that manifests the processes for the ionizing radiations and that\nevolves with redshift as reionization proceeds. Chapter 2 presents the multifrequency\nangular power spectrum (MAPS) of the epoch of reionization 21-cm signal as a joint\nfunction of the angular multipole l and frequency separation \u2206\u03bd. This studies the\nsignature of ionized regions (bubbles) on the MAPS and its implication for separating\nforegrounds from the signal.\n\n6\n\n\f1.2 21-cm Tomography\n\n1.2.2 Detecting individual ionized bubbles in 21-cm maps\n\nIt is believed that the ionizing radiation from QSOs and the stars within galaxies\nreionize the surrounding neutral IGM. The initial framework for the growth of HII\nregions around individual galaxies have been developed by Arons & Wingert (1972) and\nShapiro & Giroux (1987). Later various types of sophisticated models for the growth\nof HII regions are prescribed and used to sharpen our understanding about inhomogeneous reionizaton (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga & Hernquist 2004a; Cohn & Chang 2007;\nKramer et al. 2006). A different, complimentary approach would be to directly observe the individual ionized regions around luminous sources (stars/QSOs). The issue of\ndetecting these bubbles in radio-interferometric observations of redshifted HI 21 cm radiation has been drawing considerable attention. The detection of individual ionized bubbles would be a direct probe of the reionization process. It has also been proposed that\nsuch observations will probe the properties of the ionizing sources and the evolution of the\nsurrounding IGM (Wyithe & Loeb, 2004a; Wyithe, Loeb & Barnes, 2005; Kohler et al.,\n2005; Maselli et al., 2007; Alvarez & Abel, 2007; Geil & Wyithe, 2008; Wyithe, 2008;\nGeil et al., 2008). Observations of individual ionized bubbles would complement the\nstudy of reionization through the power spectrum of HI brightness temperature fluctuations.\nNearly all the above mentioned work on detecting ionized regions consider the contrast between the ionized regions and the neutral IGM in images of redshifted HI 21 cm\nradiation. The HI signal is expected to be only a small contribution buried deep in the\nemission from other astrophysical sources (foregrounds) and in the system noise. Chapter 3 introduces a matched filter to optimally combine the entire signal of an ionized\nbubble while minimizing the noise and foreground contributions. This technique uses\nthe visibilities which are the fundamental quantity measured in radio-interferometric ob-\n\n7\n\n\f1 Introduction\nservations. Using visibilities has an advantage over the image based techniques because\nthe system noise contribution in different visibilities is independent whereas the noise\nin different pixels of a radio-interferometric images is not. Chapter 4 presents simulation results for bubble detection in 21-cm maps and also studies the size and position\ndetermination of ionized bubbles.\n\n1.3 The Radio- Interferometric Experiments\nOn the experimental side several low frequency radio experiments are either functional\nor being set up. This motivated us to study the expected redshifted 21 cm background\nfrom the EoR and possibility to detect it. Two different observational strategies will\nbe followed. The first approach is to measure the global evolution of mean HI signal\nwith redshift, and second is to measure large scale distribution of HI through the power\nspectrum measurements and detect the HII regions. In principle both approaches would\nprovide a wealth of information about the reionization. The global signature experiments use a single, small antenna which provides a large field of view (FoV). These will\nmeasure the HI 21-cm signal in emission averaged over a large area of the sky. Two\nmain experiments, namely the Cosmological Reionization Experiments (CORE) at the\nAustralian Telescope National Facility, and the Experiment to Detect the Global EoR\nsignature (EDGES), at the MIT Haystack Observatory \u00b6 are underway in this direction.\nThe majority of the recent or upcoming radio-interferometric experiments are aimed\nat measuring the HI 21-cm signal statistically. Individual ionized wholes (bubbles)\ncan also be detected using interferometric observations of HI. The Giant Metre-Wave\nRadio Telescope (GMRTk ; Swarup et al. 1991) is already functioning at several bands\n\u00b6\nk\n\n8\n\nhttp://www.haystack.mit.edu\nhttp://www.gmrt.ncra.tifr.res.in\n\n\f1.4 Challenges to Overcome\nin the frequency range 150-1420 MHz and can potentially detect the 21 cm signal at\nhigh redshifts. In addition, construction of other low-frequency experiments such as the\nMurchison Widefield Array (MWA), LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR\u2217\u2217 ), 21 Centemeter\nArray (21CMA\u2020\u2020 ), Precision Array to Probe Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), Square\nKilometer Array(SKA \u2021\u2021 ) has raised the possibility to detect 21 cm signal from very high\nredshifts. The above first generation experiments will probably start their operation at\nthe end of the decade.\n\n1.4 Challenges to Overcome\nAlthough the redshifted 21-cm line can provide enormous amount of information, its\ndetection is going to be a huge challenge. The signal is expected to be highly contaminated by foreground radio emission. Potential sources for these foregrounds include\nsynchrotron and free-free emission from our Galaxy and external galaxies, low-frequency\nradio point sources and free-free emission from electrons in the IGM (Shaver et al. 1999;\nDiMatteo. et al. 2002, 2004; Oh & Mack 2003; Gleser et al. 2008; Ali et al. 2008). Contributions from astrophysical foregrounds are expected to be several order of magnitude\nstronger than the HI signal (Santos, Cooray & Knox (2005)).\nHowever, there have been various proposals for tackling the foregrounds, the most\npromising being the application of multi-frequency observations. The foregrounds are\nexpected to have a continuum spectra, and the contribution at two different frequencies\nseparated by \u2206\u03bd \u223c 1 MHz are expected to be highly correlated. The HI signal, on\nthe other hand, is expected to be uncorrelated at such a frequency separation and this\nholds the promise of allowing us to separate the signal from the foregrounds. It has been\n\u2217\u2217\n\nhttp://www.lofar.org/\nhttp://web.phys.cmu.edu/\u223cpast/\n\u2021\u2021\nhttp://www.skatelescope.org/\n\n\u2020\u2020\n\n9\n\n\f1 Introduction\nproposed that multi-frequency analysis of the radio signal can be useful in separating out\nthe foreground (e.g. Zaldarriaga, Furlanetto & Hernquist 2004; Santos, Cooray & Knox\n2005). An alternate approach is to subtract a best fit continuum spectra along each line\nof sight (Wang et al., 2006) and then determine the power spectrum. This is expected\nto be an effective foreground subtraction method in data with very low noise levels.\nMorales et al. (2006) have discussed the complementarity of different foreground removal\ntechniques and the implications for array design and the analysis of reionization data.\nThe system noise in all low frequency radio experiments relevant for the reionization\nis dominated by the sky contribution Tsky . We also expect Tsky to vary depending on\nwhether the source is in the galactic plane or away from it. This is expected to be an\nindependent Gaussian random variable and can be reduced by increasing observation\ntime. The observation time required to detect the HI signal is an important issue.\nMan-made radio frequency interference (RFI) is a growing problem in all earth-based\nradio astronomy. Signal from television, FM radio, satellites, mobile communication,\nelectric spark etc. all fall in the same frequency band as the redshifted 21-cm reionization signal from the reionization. These are expected to be much stronger than the\nexpected 21cm signal, and it is necessary to quantify and characterize the RFI. It has\nbeen suggested to construct EoR experiments at remote sites which are expected to have\nlow RFI. Recently Bowman et al. (2007) have characterized the RFI for the MWA site\non the frequency range 80 to 300MHz. They find an excellent RFI environment except\nfor a few channels which are dominated by satellite communication signal. There are\nseveral methods and techniques being developed to identify, characterize, and ultimately\nsubtract interfering signals (Fridman & Baan 2001; Ellingson 2005). Telescope design\nalso plays a role in mitigating interfering signals (Leshem et al. 2000). The effect of\npolarization leakage is another issue which needs to be investigated in detail. This could\ncause polarization structures on the sky to appear as frequency dependent ripples in\n\n10\n\n\f1.5 Outline of the Thesis\nthe foregrounds intensity . This could be particularly severe for the MWA which has\na wide field of view. Radio recombinations lines could be a significant contaminant in\nthe low frequency radio observations. Unfortunately due to lack of observations we have\nlittle knowledge of the impact of these lines in the epoch of reionization observation\n(Morales & Hewitt 2004). Refraction index of Earth's atmosphere varies significantly\nin space as well as in time in the frequency band relevant for EoR experiments. This\ncreates significant calibration and imaging problems that must be solved in order to reliably clean the strong foreground contamination (Thompson, Moran & Swenson 1986).\nThis is another important issue related to system noise. The FoV of the individual antenna and the baseline distribution change with observing wavelength and if these are\nneglected they could cause severe problem in extracting the signal.\n\n1.5 Outline of the Thesis\nWe give an outline of the rest of the thesis.\nChapter 2 calculates the Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum (MAPS) to\nquantify the statistics of the HI signal as a joint function of the angular multipole l and\nfrequency separation \u2206\u03bd. Assuming a small portion of a spherical sky as a flat-sky we\ndevelop formulae for MAPS, including the effect of peculiar velocities (Bharadwaj & Ali\n(2004)). The flat sky approximation is found to be a good representation over the\nangular scales of interest. The final expression is very simple to calculate and interpret\nin comparison to the formulae obtained using full spherical sky. We adopt a simple model\nfor the HI distribution which incorporates patchy reionization and use it to study the\nsignatures of ionized bubbles on MAPS. We also study the implications of the foreground\n\n11\n\n\f1 Introduction\nsubtraction.\nChapter 3 investigates the possibility of detecting individual ionized regions (bubbles) in radio-interferometric observations of HI 21 cm radiation. We develop a visibility\nbased formalism that uses a matched filter to optimally combine the entire signal from\na bubble while minimizing the noise and foreground contributions. The method makes\ndefinite predictions on the ability to detect an ionized bubble or conclusively rule out\nits presence within a radio map. We make predictions for the GMRT and the MWA at\na frequency of 150 MHz (corresponding to a redshift of 8.5).\nChapter 4 studies the impact of the HI fluctuations outside the bubble that we\nare trying to detect on the detectibility of the bubble in 21-cm maps. We use simulated\nHI maps which incorporates the patchy reionization scenarios and investigate the restrictions imposed by the HI fluctuations on bubble detection. We validate the matched\nfilter technique presented in Chapter 3 through simulation of bubble detection. We also\nuse the simulations to determine the accuracy to which the GMRT and the MWA will\nbe able to determine the size and position of an ionized bubble, and test if this is limited\ndue to the presence of HI fluctuations.\nIn Chapter 5 we estimate the optimum redshift for detecting ionized bubbles in 21cm maps for different reionization scenarios. We investigate the situations under which\nbubbles can be detected. Results are also presented in terms of the scaling relations.\n\n12\n\n\f2 Multi-frequency Angular Power\nSpectrum of 21 cm Signal \u2217\n\n2.1 Introduction\nIn this Chapter, we develop the formalism to calculate the multi-frequency angular\npower spectrum (hereafter MAPS) which can be used to analyse the 21 cm signal from\nHI both in emission and absorption against the CMB. We restrict our attention to HI\nemission which is the situation of interest for the epoch of reionization. In our formalism,\nwe consider the effect of redshift-space distortions which has been ignored in many of\nearlier works. As noted by Bharadwaj & Ali (2004), this is an important effect and\ncan enhance the mean signal by 50% or more and the effect is expected to be most\npronounced in the multi-frequency analysis. We next use the flat sky approximation\nto develop a much simpler expression of MAPS which is much easier to calculate and\ninterpret than the angular power spectrum written in terms of the spherical Bessel\n\u2217\n\nThis chapter is adapted from the paper \" The multi-frequency angular power spectrum\nof the epoch of reionization 21 cm signal\" by Datta, Choudhury & Bharadwaj (2007).\n\n13\n\n\f2 Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum of 21 cm Signal\nfunctions. We adopt a simple model for the HI distribution (Bharadwaj & Ali, 2005)\nwhich incorporates patchy reionization and use it to predict the expected signal and\nstudy its multi-frequency properties. The model allows us to vary properties like the\nsize of the ionized regions and their bias relative to the dark matter. We use MAPS to\nanalyze the imprint of these features on the HI signal and discuss their implication for\nfuture HI observations.\nAs noted earlier, the HI signal at two different frequencies separated by \u2206\u03bd is expected to become uncorrelated as \u2206\u03bd is increases. As noted in Bharadwaj & Ali (2005),\nthe value of \u2206\u03bd beyond which the signal ceases to be correlated depends on the angular scales being observed and it is < 1 MHz in most situations of interest. A prior\nestimate of the multi-frequency behavior is extremely important when planning HI observations. The width of the individual frequency channels sets the frequency resolution\nover which the signal is averaged. This should be chosen sufficiently small so that the\nsignal remains correlated over the channel width. Choosing a frequency channel which\nis too wide would end up averaging uncorrelated HI signal which would wash out various\nimportant features in the signal, and also lead to a degradation in the signal to noise\nratio. In this context we also note that an earlier work (Santos, Cooray & Knox, 2005)\nassumed individual frequency channels 1 MHz wide and smoothed the signal with this\nbefore performing the multi-frequency analysis. This, as we have already noted and shall\nstudy in detail in this Chapter, is considerably larger than the \u2206\u03bd where the signal is\nuncorrelated and hence is not the optimal strategy for the analysis. We avoid such a pitfall by not incorporating the finite frequency resolution of any realistic HI observations.\nIt is assumed that the analysis be used to determine the optimal frequency channel\nwidth for future HI observations. Further, it is quite straightforward to introduce a\nfinite frequency window into our result through a convolution.\nThe outline of this Chapter is as follows. In Section 2.2 we present the theoretical\n\n14\n\n\f2.2 Theoretical Formalism\nformalism for calculating MAPS of the expected 21 cm signal considering the effect of\nHI peculiar velocity. The calculation in the full-sky and the flat-sky approximation are\nboth presented with the details being given in separate Appendices. Section 2.2.1 defines\nvarious components of the HI power spectrum and Section 2.2.4 presents to models for\nthe HI distribution. We use these models when making predictions for the expected HI\nsignal. We present our results in Section 2.3 and also summarize our findings. In Section\n2.4 we discuss the implications for extracting the signal from the foregrounds.\n\n2.2 Theoretical Formalism\n2.2.1 The HI power spectrum\nThe aim of this Section is to set up the notation and calculate the angular correlation Cl for the 21cm brightness temperature fluctuations. It is now well known (e.g..\nBharadwaj & Ali 2005) that the excess brightness temperature observed at a frequency\n\u03bd along a direction n\u0302 is given by\n\nT (\u03bd, n\u0302) = T\u0304 (z) \u03b7HI (z, n\u0302r\u03bd )\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the frequency of observation is related to the redshift by \u03bd = 1420/(1 + z) MHz.\nWe consider a flat Universe (k = 0) in which the comoving distance r\u03bd can be written as\n\nr\u03bd =\n\nZ\n\nz\n\ndz \u2032\n0\n\nc\n.\nH(z \u2032 )\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe mean background excess brightness temperature T\u0304 (z) at redshift z is written as\nr\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013r\n\u0012\n0.15\n1+z\n1\u2212Y\n\u03a9b h2\nT\u0304 (z) \u2248 25mK\n2\n\u03a9m h\n0.022\n0.76\n10\n\n(2.3)\n\n15\n\n\f2 Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum of 21 cm Signal\nwhere Y \u2248 0.24 is the helium mass fraction and all other symbols have usual meaning. In\n1/2\n\nthe above relation, it has been assumed that the Hubble parameter H(z) \u2248 H0 \u03a9m (1 +\nz)3/2 , which is a good approximation for most cosmological models at z > 3. The quantity \u03b7HI is known as the \"21 cm radiation efficiency in redshift space\" (Bharadwaj & Ali\n2005) and can be written in terms of the mean neutral hydrogen fraction x\u0304HI and the\nfluctuation in neutral hydrogen density field \u03b4HI as\n\u0013\n\u0012\nT\u03b3\n\u03b7HI (z, n\u0302r\u03bd ) = x\u0304HI (z)[1 + \u03b4HI (z, n\u0302r\u03bd )] 1 \u2212\nTs\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(1 + z) \u2202v(z, n\u0302r\u03bd )\n\u00d7 1\u2212\nH(z)\n\u2202r\u03bd\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere T\u03b3 and Ts are the temperature of the CMB and the spin temperature of the gas\nrespectively. The term in the square bracket arises from the coherent components of\nthe HI peculiar velocities. In the above derivation it is assumed that the term (1 +\nz)\u2202v(z, n\u0302r\u03bd )/\u2202r\u03bd is small compared with H(z) which is a reasonable assumption for the\nscale of our interest.\nAt this stage, it is useful to make a set of assumptions which will simplify our analysis: (i) We assume that Ts \u226b T\u03b3 , which corresponds to the scenario where the spin\ntemperature Ts and the gas kinetic temperature are strongly coupled either through\nstrong Ly\u03b1 scattering or collisional coupling (Madau, Meiksin & Rees , 1997). Though\nthe couplings are expected to be patchy (Higgins & Meiksin 2009) the assumption is\nreasonable throughout the IGM soon after the formation of first sources of radiation.\n(ii) We assume that the HI peculiar velocity field is determined by the dark matter\nfluctuations, which is reasonable as the peculiar velocities mostly trace the dark matter\npotential wells.

Further, wherever possible, we shall not explicitly show the z dependence of\nvarious quantities like T\u0304 , x\u0304HI , P (k) etc., and it is to be understood that these are to be\nevaluated at the appropriate redshift determined by \u03bd.\nThe spherical harmonic moment of T (\u03bd, n\u0302) are defined as\nZ\n\n\u2217\nd\u03a9 Ylm\n(n\u0302) T (\u03bd, n\u0302)\nZ\nZ\nd3 k\n\u2217\n\u03b7\u0303HI (k) e\u2212ikr\u03bd (k\u0302*n\u0302) .\n= T\u0304 d\u03a9 Ylm (n\u0302)\n3\n(2\u03c0)\n\nalm (\u03bd) =\n\n(2.10)\n\nPutting the expression (2.6) for \u03b7\u0303HI (k) in the above equation, one can explicitly calculate\nthe MAPS in terms of the three dimensional power spectra defined earlier.

As a consequence the value of Cl (\u2206\u03bd) is expected to fall increasing \u2206\u03bd.

For example, at 150 MHz this is around 3\u25e6 for the\n\n19\n\n\f2 Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum of 21 cm Signal\nGMRT. In most cases of interest it suffices to consider only small angular scales which\ncorrespond to l \u226b 1. For the currently favored set of flat \u039bCDM models, a comoving\nlength scale R at redshift z > 5 would roughly correspond to a multipole\n\nl \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\n\n4\n\n\u0012\n\n1.1\n1\u2212 \u221a\n1+z\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nR\n\u22121\nh Mpc\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n(2.14)\n\nThus, for length scales of R < 100h\u22121 Mpc at z \u2248 10, one would be interested in\nmultipoles l > 200. For such high values of l one can work in the flat-sky approximation.\nA small portion of the sky can be well approximated by a plane. The unit vector n\u0302\ntowards the direction of observation can be decomposed as\n\nn\u0302 = m + \u03b8; m * \u03b8 = 0;\n\n| \u03b8 |\u226a 1\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere m is a vector towards the center of the field of view and \u03b8 is a two-dimensional\nvector in the plane of the sky. It is then natural to define the two-dimensional Fourier\ntransform of T (\u03bd, n\u0302) in the flat-sky as\n\nT\u0303 (\u03bd, U) \u2261\n\nZ\n\nd2 \u03b8 e\u22122\u03c0iU*\u03b8 T (\u03bd, n\u0302)\n\n(2.16)\n\nwhere U, which corresponds to an inverse angular scale, is the Fourier space counterpart of \u03b8. Using equations (2.1) and (2.5), and the fact that for the flat-sky we can\napproximate k * n\u0302 \u2248 k * m\u0302 \u2261 kk we have\nT\u0304\nT\u0303 (\u03bd, U) =\n2\u03c0 r\u03bd2\n\n20\n\nZ\n\ndkk e\u2212ikk r\u03bd \u03b7\u0303HI (kk m\u0302 + 2\u03c0U/r\u03bd ) .\n\n(2.17)\n\n\f2.2 Theoretical Formalism\nIt is useful to introduce the \u03b7\u0303HI power spectrum PHI defined as\n3\nh\u03b7\u0303HI (k)\u03b7\u0303HI (k\u2032 )i = (2\u03c0)3 \u03b4D\n(k \u2212 k\u2032 )PHI (k) .\n\n(2.18)\n\nThis is related to the other three power spectra introduced earlier through\nPHI (k) = x\u03042HI (z)[P\u22062HI (k) + 2\u03bc2 P\u2206HI (k) + \u03bc4 P (k)]\n\n(2.19)\n\nwhere \u03bc = m\u0302 * k\u0302 = kk /k (Barkana & Loeb 2005). Note that the anisotropy of PHI (k)\ni.e., its \u03bc-dependence arises from the peculiar velocities.\nThe quantities calculated in the flat-sky approximation can be expressed in terms\nof their all-sky counterparts. The correspondence between the all-sky angular power\nspectra and its flat-sky approximation is given by\n(2)\n\nhT\u0303 (\u03bd1 , U)T\u0303 \u2217 (\u03bd2 , U\u2032 )i = C2\u03c0U (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 ) \u03b4D (U \u2212 U\u2032 )\n\n(2.20)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b4D (U \u2212 U\u2032 ) is the two-dimensional Dirac-delta function. The details of the above\ncalculation are presented in Appendix B. Thus allows us to estimate the angular power\nspectrum Cl under the flat-sky approximation which has a much simpler expression\nClflat (\u2206\u03bd)\n\nT\u0304 2\n= 2\n\u03c0r\u03bd\n\nZ\n\nwhere the vector k has magnitude k =\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\nq\n\ndkk cos(kk r\u03bd\u2032 \u2206\u03bd) PHI (k)\n\n(2.21)\n\nkk2 + l2 /r\u03bd2 ie. k has components kk and l/r\u03bd\n\nalong the line of sight and in the plane of the sky respectively. It is clear that the\nangular power spectrum Cl (\u2206\u03bd) is calculated by summing over all Fourier modes k\nwhose projection in the plane of the sky has a magnitude l/r\u03bd . We also see that Cl is\ndetermined by the power spectra only for modes k \u2265 l/r\u03bd .\n\n21\n\n\f2 Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum of 21 cm Signal\nThe flat-sky angular power spectrum Clflat (0) is essentially the 2D power spectrum of\nthe HI distribution on a plane at the distance r\u03bd from the observer, and for \u2206\u03bd = 0 equation (2.21) is just the relation between the 2D power spectrum and its 3D counterpart\n(Peacock (1999)). For \u2206\u03bd 6= 0 it is the cross-correlation of the 2D Fourier components\nof the HI distribution on two different planes, one at r\u03bd and another at r\u03bd+\u2206\u03bd . Any\n2D Fourier mode is calculated from its full 3D counterparts by projecting the 3D modes\nonto the plane where the 2D Fourier mode is being evaluated. The same set of 3D modes\ncontribute with different phases when they are projected onto two different planes. This\ngives rise to cos(kk r\u03bd\u2032 \u2206\u03bd) in equation (2.21) when the same 2D mode on two different\nplanes are cross-correlated and this in turn causes the decorrelation of Clflat (\u2206\u03bd) with\nincreasing \u2206\u03bd.\nTesting the range of l over which the flat-sky approximation is valid, we find that\nfor the typical HI power spectra Clflat (\u2206\u03bd) is in agreement with the full-sky Cl (\u2206\u03bd)\ncalculated using equation (2.11) at a level better than 1 per cent for angular modes\nl > 10. Since the integral in equation (2.21) is much simpler to compute, and more\nstraightforward to interpret, we use the flat-sky approximation of Cl for our calculations\nin the rest of this Chapter.\nNote that equation (2.21) is very similar to the expression for the visibility correlations [equation (16) of Bharadwaj & Ali 2005] expected in radio interferometric observations of redshifted 21 cm HI emission. The two relations differ only in a proportionality\nfactor which incorporates the parameters of the telescope being used for the observation.\nThis reflects the close relation between the visibility correlations, which are the directly\nmeasurable quantities in radio interferometry, and the Cl s considered here.\n\n22\n\n\f2.2 Theoretical Formalism\n\n2.2.4 Modeling the HI distribution\n\nThe crucial quantities in calculating the angular correlation function are the three dimensional power spectra P (k), P\u2206HI (k) and P\u22062HI (k). The form of the dark matter power\nspectrum P (k) is relatively well-established, particularly within the linear theory. We\nshall be using the standard expression given by (Bunn & White (, 1997)).\nThe power spectrum of HI density fluctuations P\u22062HI (k) and its cross-correlation with\nthe dark matter fluctuations P\u2206HI (k) are both largely unknown, and determining these is\none of the most important aims of the future redshifted 21 cm observations. A possible\napproach could be to implement some specific model for reionization, then attempt to\npredict the expected patchiness in the HI distribution and calculate the power spectra.\nSuch an exercise is somewhat beyond the scope of this paper. The objective here is to\nquantify the angular power spectrum in terms of the physical attributes characteristic\nof the HI distribution at the epoch of reionization. To this end we adopt two simple\nmodels with a few parameters which capture the salient features of the HI distribution.\nThe first model, which we shall denote as DM, assumes homogeneous reionization\nwhere the HI traces the dark matter , i.e., \u2206HI = \u2206. This model does not introduce\na characteristic length-scale in the HI distribution, and hence it serves as the fiducial\nmodel against which we can compare the predictions for patchy reionization. Under the\nstandard scenario of reionization by UV sources, this is a valid assumption in very early\nstages of reionization when most of the IGM is neutral. However, this assumption could\nhave another range of validity. This has to do with the scenarios where the dominant\nsource of reionization are the exotic decaying particles, like neutrinos. In such case,\nthere would be no bubbles associated with individual galaxies, rather the reionization\nproceeds in a homogeneous manner. In this model we have\n\n23\n\n\f2 Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum of 21 cm Signal\n\nP\u22062HI (k) = P\u2206HI (k) = P (k)\n\n(2.22)\n\nwhich we use in equation (2.11) to calculate Cl (\u2206\u03bd). Alternately, we have\nPHI (k) = x\u03042HI (1 + \u03bc2 )2 P (k)\n\n(2.23)\n\nwhich we can use in equation (2.21) to calculate Cl (\u2206\u03bd) in the flat-sky approximation.\nThis model has only one free parameter namely the mean neutral fraction x\u0304HI .\nThe second model, denoted as PR, incorporates patchy reionization. It is assumed\nthat reionization occurs through the growth of completely ionized regions (bubbles) in\nthe hydrogen distribution. The bubbles are assumed to be spheres, all with the same\ncomoving radius R, their centers tracing the dark matter distribution with a possible\nbias bc . While in reality there will be a spread in the shapes and sizes of the ionized\npatches, we can consider R as being the characteristic size at any particular epoch.\nThe distribution of the centers of the ionized regions basically incorporates the fact\nthat the ionizing sources are expected to reside at the peaks of the dark matter density\ndistribution and these are expected to be strongly clustered. For non-overlapping spheres\nthe fraction of ionized volume is given by\n\nx\u0304HII \u2261 1 \u2212 x\u0304HI =\n\n4\u03c0R3\n\u00f1HII\n3\n\n(2.24)\n\nwhere \u00f1HII is the mean comoving number density of ionized spheres and we use R to\ndenote the ratio R = x\u0304HII /x\u0304HI . This model has been discussed in detail in Bharadwaj\nand Ali (2005), and we have\n\n\u2206HI (k) = [1 \u2212 bc RW (kR)] \u2206(k) \u2212 RW (kR)\u2206P (k) .\n\n24\n\n(2.25)\n\n\f2.2 Theoretical Formalism\nThe HI fluctuation is a sum of two parts, one which is correlated with the dark matter distribution and an uncorrelated Poisson fluctuation \u2206P . The latter arises from\nthe discrete nature of the HII regions and has a power spectrum \u00f1\u22121\nHII . Also, W (y) =\n(3/y 3)[sin y \u2212 y cos y] is the spherical top hat window function arising from the Fourier\ntransform of the spherical bubbles. This gives\n\nP\n\n\u22062HI\n\n[RW (kR)]2\n(k) = [1 \u2212 Rbc W (kR)] P (k) +\n\u00f1HII\n2\n\n(2.26)\n\nand\nP\u2206HI (k) = [1 \u2212 Rbc W (kR)] P (k)\n\n(2.27)\n\nwhich we use in equation (2.11) to calculate Cl (\u2206\u03bd). Alternately, we have the HI power\nspectrum (Bharadwaj and Ali, 2005)\n\nPHI (k) =\n\nx\u03042HI\n\n\u001a\n\n[RW (kR)]2\n[1 \u2212 Rbc W (kR) + \u03bc ] P (k) +\n\u00f1HII\n2 2\n\n\u001b\n\n(2.28)\n\nwhich we can use in equation (2.21) to calculate Cl (\u2206\u03bd) in the flat-sky approximation.\nThis model has three independent parameters, namely the average neutral fraction\nx\u0304HI , the comoving radius of the ionized bubbles R and the bias of the bubble centers with\nrespect to the dark matter bc . Our analysis assumes non-overlapping spheres and hence\nit is valid only when a small fraction of the HI is ionized and the bias is not very large.\nAs a consequence we restrict these parameters to the range x\u0304HI \u2265 0.5 and bc \u2264 1.5. We\nnote that in the early stages of reionization (ie. x\u0304HII \u226a 1) equation (2.28) matches the\nHI power spectrum calculated by Wang & Hu (2005), though their method of arriving\nat the final result is somewhat different and is quite a bit more involved.\nFigure 2.1 shows the behaviour of PHI (k) for the two different models considered\nhere.

Other than the one labeled DM, the curves are\nall for the PR model with different values of R and bc as indicated in the\nfigure. Here the \u03bc dependence has been incorporated by using the average\nvalue h\u03bc2 i = 1/3.\nthe best-fit values by WMAP 3-year data release, i.e., \u03a9m = 0.23, \u03a9b h2 = 0.022, ns =\n0.96, h = 0.74, \u03c38 = 0.76 (Spergel et al. 2006). Further, without any loss of generality, we\nhave restricted our analysis to a single redshift z = 10 which corresponds to a frequency\n\u03bd = 129 MHz, and have assumed x\u0304HI = 0.6 (implying R = 2/3) which is consistent with\ncurrently favoured reionization models.\nThe reason for choosing this particular redshift is that the effects of patchy reionization are expected to be most prominent around z \u2248 10 in currently favoured reionization\nmodels. At higher redshifts, the reionization is in its preliminary stages (x\u0304HII \u226a 1) and\nthe characteristic bubble size R is quite small. This implies that the effects of patchy\nreionization are not substantial and hence the HI distribution essentially traces the dark\nmatter. Thus our results for the DM model are representative of what is expected at\n\n26\n\n\f2.2 Theoretical Formalism\nhigher redshifts, just that the overall normalization of PHI (k) would possibly be z dependent through the values of the growing mode of density perturbations and the neutral\nfraction. At lower redshifts the HI signal is expected to be drastically diminished because most of the hydrogen would be ionized. Given this, it is optimum to study the\nHI signal properties at some intermediate redshift where x\u0304HII \u223c 0.5 and R is reasonably\nlarge. For the currently favoured reionization scenarios, it seems that these properties\nare satisfied at z \u2248 10 (Choudhury & Ferrara 2006a), which we shall be studying in the\nrest of this paper.\nThe curve labeled DM in Figure 2.1 shows PHI (k) when the HI traces the dark\nmatter. The characteristic scale in this power spectrum is set by the Fourier mode\nentering the horizon at the epoch of matter radiation equality. The imprint of the\nacoustic oscillations in the dark matter power spectrum holds interesting possibilities for\ndetermining cosmological parameters using high-z HI observations, we do not consider\nthis here. The other curves in Figure 2.1 all show the PR model for different values of\nR and bc . The point to note is that for large values of the bubble size (R \u2265 8 Mpc)\nthe power spectrum is essentially determined by the Poisson fluctuation term PHI (k) \u2248\nx\u03042HI R2 W 2 (kR)/\u00f1HII = x\u0304HII W 2 (kR)(4\u03c0R3 /3), which scales as R3 and is independent of\nthe bias parameter bc . For length-scales larger than the bubble size (k < \u03c0/R) we\nhave W 2 (kR) \u2248 1, and hence the power spectrum is practically constant PHI (k) \u2248\nx\u0304HII (4\u03c0R3 /3). Around scales corresponding to the characteristic bubble size k \u2248 \u03c0/R,\nthe window function W (kR) starts decreasing which introduces a prominent drop in\nPHI (k). For smaller length-scales (k > \u03c0/R), the power spectrum shows oscillations\narising from the nature of the window function W (kR). At these scales, the amplitude\nof W 2 (kR) decreases as (kR)\u22124 which is more rapid than P (k). Hence, at sufficiently\nlarge k the power spectrum PHI (k) is dominated by the dark matter fluctuations and\nit approaches the DM model, with the approach being faster for large R. We should\n\n27\n\n\f2 Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum of 21 cm Signal\nmention here that the oscillations in PHI (k) are a consequence of the fact that we have\nchosen the ionized bubbles to be spheres, all of the same size. In reality the ionized\nregions will have a spread in the bubble shapes and sizes, and it is quite likely that such\noscillation will be washed out (Wang & Hu 2005) but we expect the other features of the\nPR model discussed above to hold if the characteristic bubble size is large (R \u2265 8 Mpc).\nFor smaller values of R, the power spectrum PHI (k) could be dominated either by\nthe term containing the dark matter power spectrum P (k) or by the Poisson fluctuation\nterm, depending on the value of Rbc = 2bc /3. For values of bc \u2248 3/2, the coefficient of\nP (k) in equation (2.28) tends to vanish, and hence the Poisson fluctuations dominate.\nThis is obvious from the curve with parameters {R, bc } = {2 Mpc, 1.5} in Figure 2.1.\nOn the other hand, when the bias parameter is small, say bc \u2264 1, the dark matter term\ndominates over the Poisson fluctuation term at large length-scales (k < 0.25 Mpc\u22121 ),\nwhich can be seen from the curve with {R, bc } = {2 Mpc, 1}. There is some difference\nbetween this curve and the DM model because of the Rbc W (kR) factor in equation\n(2.28). In fact, the the PR and DM models exactly coincide at large scales for {R, bc } =\n{2 Mpc, 0} which we have not shown separately in Figure 2.1. At small length-scales\n(k & 0.25 Mpc\u22121 ) the amplitude of the dark matter power spectrum becomes less than\nthat of the Poisson fluctuation term, and hence PHI (k) is independent of bc (one can see\nthat the curve having bc = 1 overlaps with the one having higher bias factor bc = 1.5).\nAs mentioned earlier, at small length-scales (kR \u226b 1) we expect the W 2 (kR) to decay\nrapidly as (kR)\u22124 , and as a consequence PHI (k) will basically trace the dark matter.\nIt may be noted that for R = 2Mpc we do not notice this behaviour all the way till\nk = 10 Mpc\u22121 which is shown in the Figure 2.1.\nIn addition to the effects considered above, the random motions within clusters could\nsignificantly modify the signal by elongating the HI clustering pattern along the line of\nsight [the Finger of God (FoG) effect]. We have incorporated this effect by multiplying\n\n28\n\n\f2.3 Results\n\n[l(l+1)C l /2\u03c0 ] 1/2 [mK]\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n\nDM\n2 Mpc\n8 Mpc\n\n0.1\n\n32 Mpc\n0.01\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n100000\n\nl\nFigure 2.2: The angular power spectrum of HI brightness temperature fluctuations for\ndifferent models of the HI distribution assuming bc = 1 and \u03c3p = 0.\nthe power spectrum PHI (k) with an extra Lorentzian term (1 + kk2 \u03c3P2 /a2 H 2 )\u22121 (Sheth\n1996; Ballinger et al. 1996) where \u03c3P is the one dimensional pair-velocity dispersion in\nrelative galaxy velocities.\n\n2.3 Results\nWe first consider the angular power spectrum Cl (\u2206\u03bd) at \u2206\u03bd = 0 for which the results are\nshown in Figure 2.2. As discussed earlier, Cl (0) is essentially the 2D power spectrum of\nHI fluctuations evaluated at the 2D Fourier mode l/r\u03bd \u2248 l \u00d7 10\u22124 Mpc\u22121 . The results for\nthe DM model serve as the fiducial case against which we compare different possibilities\nfor patchy reionization.\nFor large bubble size (R \u2265 8 Mpc) the HI signal is dominated by Poisson fluctuations\n\n29\n\n\f2 Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum of 21 cm Signal\nand it is well described through\np\n\nl(l + 1)Cl \u221d\n\n\u221a\n\nxHII T\u0304\n\nR\nl\nr\u03bd\n\n(2.29)\n\non scales larger than the bubble. At these angular scales the HI signal is substantially\nenhanced compared to the DM model. For smaller bubble size, the large angle signal\nis sensitive to the bias bc . The signal is very similar to the DM model for bc = 0 and\nit is suppressed for higher bias. In all cases (large or small bubble size), the signal is\nPoisson fluctuation dominated on scales comparable to the bubble size and it peaks at\nl \u2248 \u03c0r\u03bd /R, with no dependence on bc . The HI signal traces the dark matter on scales\nwhich are much smaller than the bubble size.\nWe next consider the behavior of \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd), the frequency decorrelation function shown\nin Figure 2.3. For the DM model (upper left panel) where the HI fluctuations trace the\ndark matter we find that the frequency difference \u2206\u03bd over which the HI signal remains\ncorrelated reduces monotonically with increasing l. For example, while for l = 100\n\u03bal (\u2206\u03bd) falls to \u223c 0.5 at \u2206\u03bd \u223c 500 KHz, it occurs much faster (\u2206\u03bd \u223c 10 KHz) for\nl = 105 . Beyond the first zero crossing \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd) becomes negative (anti-correlation) and\nexhibits a few highly damped oscillations very close to zero. These oscillations arise\nfrom the cos term in equation (2.21). The change in the behavior of \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd) for the DM\nmodel arising from the FoG effect is also shown in the same panel. Wang & Hu (2005)\nhave proposed that \u03c3p is expected to have a value \u223c 30 km/s at z \u223c 8; in view of this,\nwe show results for \u03c3p = 20 and 40 km/s. We find that there is a discernible change at\nl \u2265 104 , and the FoG effect causes the signal to remain correlated for a larger value of\n\u2206\u03bd. For \u03c3p = 20 km/s, the change is at most 15% for l = 104 and around 100% at\nl = 105 . Though we have not shown it explicitly, we expect similar changes due to FoG\neffect in the PR model also.\n\n30\n\n\f2.3 Results\n\nFigure 2.3: The frequency decorrelation function \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd) [defined in equation (2.13)] at\nl = 102 , 103 , 104, 105 . Results are shown for the DM model and the PR model\nwith bc = 1 and the R values shown in the figure. For the DM model, we\nshow results incorporating the FoG effect using \u03c3P = 20 and 40 km/s. For\neach l value \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd) decreases faster for \u03c3P = 0 and slowest for \u03c3P = 40 km/s.\nThere is a significant change due to the FoG effect only at l \u2265 104 .\n\n31\n\n\f2 Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum of 21 cm Signal\nThe patchy reionization model shows distinct departures from the DM model in the\nbehavior of \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd). This reflects the imprint of the bubble size and the bias on the\n\u2206\u03bd dependence. For R = 2 Mpc and bc = 1 (upper right panel) the large l (l > 1000,\ncomparable to bubble size) behavior is dominated by the Poisson fluctuation of the\nindividual bubbles which makes \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd) quite distinct from the DM model. Notice that\nfor l = 103 , \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd) falls faster than the DM model whereas for l = 104 it falls slower than\nthe DM model causing the l = 103 and 104 curves to nearly overlap. The oscillations\nseen in Cl as a function of l in Figure 2.2 are also seen in the \u2206\u03bd dependence of \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd)\nat large l (105 ). The behavior at l = 102 is a combination of the dark matter and the\nionized bubbles, and is sensitive to bc . For bc = 1, the initial decrease in \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd) is\nmuch steeper than the DM model with a sudden break after which the curve flattens.\nFigure 2.4 shows the bc dependence for l = 102 and 103 . The bias dependence is weak for\nl = 103 where the Poisson fluctuations begin to dominate. For l = 102 , changing bc has a\nsignificant affect only near the break in \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd) leaving much of the curve unaffected. For\na smaller bubble size we expect a behavior similar to R = 2Mpc, with the bc dependence\nbeing somewhat more pronounced and the Poisson dominated regime starting from a\nlarger value of l.\nFor large bubble size (R \u2265 8Mpc) the large angle HI signal (l < \u03c0r\u03bd /R) is entirely\ndetermined by the Poisson fluctuations where the signal is independent of l. This is\nmost clearly seen for R = 8Mpc where the \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd) curves for l = 102 and l = 103 are\nidentical. For both R = 8Mpc and 32 Mpc the large l behavior of \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd) approaches\nthat of the DM model.\nIn the final part we quantify the frequency difference \u2206\u03bd across which the HI signal\nat two different frequencies remain correlated. To be more precise, we study the behavior\nof \u2206\u03bd1/2 which is defined such that \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd1/2 ) = 1/2 ie. the correlation falls to 50% of\nits peak value at \u2206\u03bd = 0. We study this for different angular scales (different l) for the\n\n32\n\n\f2.3 Results\n\n1\n\n2 Mpc\n\n0.8\n\n\u03ba l(\u2206\u03bd)\n\n0.6\n\nl=10 2 ,bc =1\n0.4\n\nl=10 2 ,b c =1.5\nl=10 3 ,bc =1\n\n0.2\n\n3\n\nl=10 ,bc =1.5\n0\n\u22120.2\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n\u2206\u03bd MHz\nFigure 2.4: This shows the bc dependence of the frequency decorrelation function \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd)\nfor the PR model with R = 2 Mpc.\n\n33\n\n\f2 Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum of 21 cm Signal\n10\n\nDM\nR= 2 Mpc\nR= 8 Mpc\n\n1\n\n\u2206\u03bd\n\n1/2\n\nR= 32 Mpc\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n100000\n\nl\nFigure 2.5: This shows \u2206\u03bd1/2 vs. l for the DM model and the PR model with bc = 1 for\nthe R values shown in the figure.\nvarious models of HI distribution considered here. The main aim of this exercise is to\ndetermine the frequency resolution that would be required to study the HI fluctuations\non a given angular scale l. Optimally one would like to use a frequency resolution\nsmaller than \u2206\u03bd1/2 . A wider frequency channel would combine different uncorrelated\nsignals whereby the signal would cancel out. Further, combining such signals would not\nlead to an improvement in the signal to noise ratio. Thus it would be fruitful to combine\nthe signal at two different frequencies only as long as they are correlated and not beyond,\nand we use \u2206\u03bd1/2 to estimate this. The plot of \u2206\u03bd1/2 vs l for the different HI models is\nshown in Figure 2.5.\nWe find that for the DM model \u2206\u03bd1/2 falls monotonically with l and the relation is\nwell approximated by a power law\n\n\u2206\u03bd1/2 = 0.2 MHz \u00d7\n\n34\n\n\u0012\n\nl\n103\n\n\u0013\u22120.7\n\n(2.30)\n\n\f2.4 Implications for Separating Signal from Foregrounds\nwhich essentially says that \u2206\u03bd1/2 \u223c 0.66 MHz on 1\u25e6 angular scales, \u2206\u03bd1/2 \u223c 0.04 MHz\non 1\u2032 angular scales and \u2206\u03bd1/2 \u223c 2 KHz on 1\u2032\u2032 angular scales.\nFor the PR model, as discussed earlier, \u03bal (\u2206\u03bd) is l independent on angular scales\nlarger than the bubble size l < \u03c0r\u03bd /R. As a consequence \u2206\u03bd1/2 also is independent of l\nand it depends only on the bubble size R.

Figure 2.6 shows the expected Cl (0) for the signal and foregrounds. The galactic synchrotron radiation dominates at large angular scales l < 10, 000\n\n36\n\n\f2.4 Implications for Separating Signal from Foregrounds\nwhile the extragalactic point sources dominate at small angular scales. For all values of\nl, the foregrounds are at least two orders of magnitude larger than the signal.\nThe foregrounds have a continuum spectra, and the contributions at a frequency\nseparation \u2206\u03bd are expected to be highly correlated. For \u2206\u03bd = 1 MHz, the foreground\ndecorrelation function Il (\u2206\u03bd) falls by only 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 for the galactic synchrotron radiation and by 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 for the point sources. In contrast, the HI decorrelation function\n\u03bal (\u2206\u03bd) is nearly constant at very small \u2206\u03bd and then has a sharp drop well within\n1 MHz, and is largely uncorrelated beyond. This holds the promise of allowing the\nsignal to be separated from the foregrounds. A possible strategy is to cross-correlate different frequency channels of the full data which has both signal and foregrounds, and to\nuse the distinctly different \u2206\u03bd dependence to separate the signal from the foregrounds\n(Zaldarriaga, Furlanetto & Hernquist, 2004). An alternate approach is to subtract a\nbest fit continuum spectra along each line of sight (Wang et al., 2006) and then determine the power spectrum. This is expected to be an effective foreground subtraction\nmethod in data with very low noise levels. We consider the former approach here, and\ndiscuss the implications of our results.\nMAPS characterizes the joint l and \u2206\u03bd dependence which is expected to be different\nfor the signal and the foregrounds.

Note that\nbecause the foregrounds are much stronger than the HI signal, a very small decorrelation\nof the foreground contribution may cause a decrement in Cl (\u2206\u03bd) which is larger than\nthat due to the signal.

First\n\u2032\n\nwe note that Fl (\u2206\u03bd) peaks at the angular scales corresponding to l \u223c 10, 000 (ie. 2 )\nand the prospects of separating the signal from the foregrounds are most favorable\nat these scales. A detection will be possible in the range l > 1000, \u2206\u03bd \u2264 10KHz\nand l > 400,\u2206\u03bd \u2264 100KHz for the DM and PR models respectively provided the \u2206\u03bd\ndependence of the foregrounds Cl (\u2206\u03bd) can be characterized with an uncertainty less than\norder unity. The l and \u2206\u03bd range would increase if the \u2206\u03bd dependence of the foreground\nCl (\u2206\u03bd) were characterized to 10% accuracy. The largest angular scales ( l < 100 ) would\nrequire an accuracy better than 1% which would possibly set the limit for forthcoming\nobservations.\nThe angular modes l = 1, 000 and l = 10, 000 correspond to baselines with antenna\nseparations of \u223c 300 m and \u223c 3 km respectively. This baseline range is quite well\ncovered by the GMRT, and also the forthcoming interferometric arrays. This is possibly\n\n38\n\n\f2.4 Implications for Separating Signal from Foregrounds\nthe optimal range for a detection. A possible detection strategy would be to use the\n\u2206\u03bd behavior of Cl (\u2206\u03bd) in the range where Fl (\u2206\u03bd) \u226a 1 to characterize the foreground\ncontribution. This can be extrapolated to predict the foreground contribution at small\n\u2206\u03bd and any excess relative to this prediction can be interpreted as the HI signal. A very\nprecise determination of the \u2206\u03bd dependence of the foreground contribution would require\na very large \u2206\u03bd range in the region where Fl (\u2206\u03bd) \u226a 1, and a bandwidth of \u223c 10MHz\nwould be appropriate. On the other hand, at l \u223c 10, 000 the HI Cl (\u2206\u03bd) decorrelates\nwithin \u223c 50KHz [or equivalently Fl (\u2206\u03bd) shows a considerable drop between 10 KHz and\n100 KHz, see Figure 2.7], and it would be desirable to have a frequency resolution better\nthan \u223c 10KHz to optimally differentiate between the signal and the foregrounds. A\nlower resolution of \u223c 20 KHz would possibly suffice at l \u223c 1, 000, particularly if the PR\nmodel holds.\n\n39\n\n\f2 Multi-frequency Angular Power Spectrum of 21 cm Signal\n\n40\n\n\f3 Detecting Ionized Bubbles in\nRedshifted 21 cm Maps \u2217\n\n3.1 Introduction\nIn this Chapter we consider the possibility of detecting ionized bubbles in redshifted\n21 cm HI maps. An ionized bubble embedded in HI will appear as a decrement in the\nbackground redshifted 21 cm radiation. This decrement will typically span across several\npixels and frequency channels in redshifted 21 cm maps. Detecting this is a big challenge because the HI signal (\u223c 1 mJy or lower ) will be buried in foregrounds which are\nexpected to be at least 2 \u2212 3 orders of magnitude larger. An objective detection criteria\nwhich optimally combines the entire signal in the bubble while minimizing contributions\nfrom foregrounds, system noise and other such sources is needed to search for ionized bubbles. The noise in different pixels of maps obtained from radio-interferometric\nobservations is correlated (eg. Thompson, Moran & Swenson (1986)), and it is most\nconvenient to deal with visibilities instead. These are the primary quantities that are\nmeasured in radio-interferometry.\n\u2217\n\nThis chapter is adapted from the paper \"Detecting ionized bubbles in redshifted 21 cm\nmaps\" by Datta, Bharadwaj & Choudhury (2007).\n\n41\n\n\f3 Detecting Ionized Bubbles in Redshifted 21 cm Maps\nIn this Chapter we develop a visibility based formalism to detect an ionized bubble\nor conclusively rule it out in radio-interferometric observations of HI at high redshifts.\nWe apply our formalism for detecting ionized bubbles to make predictions for the GMRT\nand for one of the forthcoming instruments, namely the MWA. For both telescopes we\ninvestigate the feasibility of detecting the bubbles, and in situations where a detection\nis feasible we predict the required observation time. For both telescopes we make predictions for observations only at a single frequency (150MHz), the aim here being to\ndemonstrate the utility of our formalism and not present an exhaustive analysis of the\nfeasibility of detecting ionized bubbles in different scenarios and circumstances. For the\nGMRT we have used the telescope parameters from their website, while for the MWA\nwe use the telescope parameters from Bowman et al. (2006).\nThe outline of the Chapter is as follows: In Section 3.2 we discuss various sources\nwhich are expected to contribute in low frequency radio-interferometric observation,\nthis includes the signal expected from an ionized bubble. In Section 3.3 we present the\nformalism for detecting an ionized bubble, and in Section 3.4 we present the results and\ndiscuss its implications. The cosmological parameters used throughout this Chapter are\nthose determined as the best-fit mean values for a flat \u039bCDM model by WMAP 3-year\ndata release, i.e., \u03a9m = 0.23, \u03a9bh2 = 0.022, ns = 0.96, h = 0.74, \u03c38 = 0.76 (Spergel et al.\n2006).\n\n3.2 Different Sources that Contribute to Low Frequency\nRadio Observations\n~ , \u03bd)\nThe quantity measured in radio-interferometric observations is the visibility V (U\nwhich is measured in a number of frequency channels \u03bd across a frequency bandwidth\n\n42\n\n\f3.2 Different Sources that Contribute to Low Frequency Radio Observations\nB for every pair of antennas in the array.

Each MWA antenna element\nconsists of 16 crossed dipoles distributed uniformly in a square shaped tile, and this is\nstationary with respect to the earth. The MWA beam pattern is quite complicated,\nand it depends on the pointing angle relative to the zenith (Bowman et al., 2007). Our\nanalysis largely deals with the beam pattern within 1\u25e6 of the pointing angle where it is\nreasonable to approximate the beam as being circularly symmetric (Figures 3 and 5 of\nBowman et al. 2007 ). We approximate the MWA antenna beam pattern as a Gaussian\nwith \u03b80 = 18\u25e6 at 153 MHz. Note that the MWA primary beam pattern is better modeled\nas A(~\u03b8) \u221d cos2 (K\u03b8), but a Gaussian gives a reasonable approximation in the center of\nthe beam which is the region of interest here. Equation (3.1) is valid only under the\nassumption that the field of view is small so that it can be well approximated by a plane,\nor under the unlikely circumstances that all the antennas are coplanar.\nThe visibility recorded in 150 MHz radio-interferometric observations is a combination of three separate contributions\n~ , \u03bd) = S(U\n~ , \u03bd) + N(U\n~ , \u03bd) + F (U\n~ , \u03bd)\nV (U\n\n(3.2)\n\n43\n\n\f3 Detecting Ionized Bubbles in Redshifted 21 cm Maps\n~ \u03bd) is the HI signal that we are interested in, N(U\n~ , \u03bd) is the system noise which\nwhere S(U,\n~ \u03bd) is the contribution from other astrophysical\nis inherent to the measurement and F (U,\nsources referred to as the foregrounds. Man-made radio frequency interference (RFI)\nfrom cell phones and other communication devices are also expected to contribute to\nthe measured visibilities. Given the lack of a detailed model for the RFI contribution,\nand anticipating that it may be possible to remove it before the analysis, we do not take\nit into account here.\n\n3.2.1 The HI signal from ionized bubbles\nAccording to models of reionization by UV sources, the early stages of reionization are\ncharacterized by ionized HII regions around individual source (QSOs or galaxies). As a\nfirst approximation, we consider these regions as ionized spherical bubbles characterized\nby three parameters, namely, its comoving radius Rb , the redshift of its center zc and the\nposition of the center determined by the two-dimensional vector in the sky-plane ~\u03b8c . The\nbubble is assumed to be embedded in an uniform intergalactic medium (IGM) with a\nneutral hydrogen fraction xHI . We use r\u03bd to denote the comoving distance to the redshift\nwhere the HI emission, received at a frequency \u03bd = 1420 MHz/(1 + z), originated, and\ndefine r\u03bd\u2032 = d r\u03bd /d \u03bd. The planar section through the bubble at a comoving distance\np\nr\u03bd is a disk of comoving radius R\u03bd = Rb 1 \u2212 (\u2206\u03bd/\u2206\u03bdb )2 where \u2206\u03bd = \u03bdc \u2212 \u03bd is the\ndistance from the the bubble center \u03bdc in frequency space with \u03bdc = 1420 MHz/(1 + zc )\nand \u2206\u03bdb = Rb /r\u03bd\u2032 c is the bubble size in the frequency space. The bubble, obviously,\nextends from \u03bdc \u2212 \u2206\u03bdb to \u03bdc + \u2206\u03bdb in frequency and in each frequency channel within\nthis frequency range the image of the ionized bubble is a circular disk of angular radius\n\u03b8\u03bd = R\u03bd /r\u03bd ; the bubble is not seen in HI beyond this frequency range. Under such\n\n44\n\n\f3.2 Different Sources that Contribute to Low Frequency Radio Observations\nassumptions, the specific intensity of the redshifted HI emission is\nI\u03bd (~\u03b8) = I \u0304\u03bd xHI\n\nwhere I \u0304\u03bd = 2.5\u00d7102 Jy\nsr\n\n\u0010\n\n\"\n\n\u03a9b h 2\n0.02\n\n| ~\u03b8 \u2212 ~\u03b8c |\n1\u2212\u0398 1\u2212\n\u03b8\u03bd\n\n\u0011\n\n0.7\nh\n\n\u0001\u0010\n\nH0\nH(z)\n\n\u0011\n\n!#\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n| \u03bd \u2212 \u03bdc |\n\u0398 1\u2212\n\u2206\u03bdb\n\n(3.3)\n\nis the radiation background from the uniform\n\nHI distribution and \u0398(x) is the Heaviside step function.\nThe soft X-ray emission from the quasar responsible for the ionized region is expected\nto heat the neutral IGM in a shell around the ionized bubble. The HI emission from\nthis shell is expected to be somewhat higher than I \u0304\u03bd (Wyithe & Loeb, 2004a). We do\nnot expect this to make a very big contribution, and we do not consider this here.\nIf we assume that the angular extent of the ionized bubble is small compared to the\n~ outside the integral in eq.\nangular scale of primary beam ie. \u03b8\u03bd \u226a \u03b80 , we can take A(\u03b8)\nR\n~~\n(3.1) and write the signal as A(~\u03b8c ) d2 \u03b8I\u03bd (~\u03b8)e2\u03c0\u0131\u03b8*U , which essentially involves a Fourier\n\u0010\n\u0011\ntransform of the circular aperture \u0398 1\u2212 | ~\u03b8 \u2212 ~\u03b8c | r\u03bd /R\u03bd . For example, a bubble of\nradius as large as 40 Mpc at z = 8.5 would have an angular size of only \u03b8\u03bd \u2248 0.25\u25e6 which\n\nsatisfies the condition \u03b8\u03bd \u226a \u03b80 .

Detecting\n\nthese ionized bubbles will be a big challenge because the signal is buried in noise and\nforegrounds which are both considerably larger in amplitude. Whether we are able to\ndetect the ionized bubbles or not depends critically on our ability to construct optimal\nfilters which discriminate the signal from other contributions.\n\n3.2.2 HI fluctuations\nIn the previous sub-section, we assumed the ionized bubble to be embedded in a perfectly uniform IGM. In reality, however, there would be fluctuations in the HI distribution in the IGM which, in turn, would contribute to the visibilities. This contri~ , \u03bd) with zero mean\nbution to the HI signal can be treated as a random variable \u015c(U\n~ , \u03bd)i = 0, whose statistical properties are characterized by the two-visibility correh\u015c(U\n~ 1 , \u03bd1 )\u015c(U\n~ 2 , \u03bd2 )i. This is related to PHI (k) the power spectrum of the 21 cm\nlation h\u015c(U\nradiation efficiency in redshift space (Bharadwaj & Ali, 2004) through\n \u03042 2\n~ 1 , \u03bd)\u015c \u2217 (U\n~ 2 , \u03bd + \u2206\u03bd)i=\u03b4 ~ ~ I\u03bd \u03b80\nh\u015c(U\nU1 , U2\n2r\u03bd2\nZ \u221e\n\u00d7\ndkk PHI (k) cos(kk r\u03bd\u2032 \u2206\u03bd)\n\n(3.6)\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03b4U~ 1 ,U~ 2 is the Kronecker delta ie. different baselines are uncorrelated, To estimate\nthe contribution from the HI fluctuations we make the simplifying assumption that the\n2\n\nHI traces the dark matter, which gives PHI (k) = x\u03042HI (1 + \u03bc2 ) P (k) where P (k) is the\ndark matter power spectrum and \u03bc is the cosine of the angle between k and the line of\nsight. This assumption is reasonable because the scales of interest are much larger than\n\n48\n\n\f3.2 Different Sources that Contribute to Low Frequency Radio Observations\nthe Jeans length \u03bbJ \u223c 10 \u2212 100 kpc, and we expect the HI to cluster in the same way as\nthe dark matter.\nIn addition to the above, there could be other contributions to the HI signal too.\nFor example, there would be several other ionized regions in the field of view other\nthan the bubble under consideration. The Poisson noise from these ionized patches will\nincrease the HI fluctuations and there will also be an overall drop in the contribution\nbecause of the reduced neutral fraction. These effects will depend on the reionization\nmodel, and the simple assumptions made would only provide a representative estimate\nof the actual contribution. Figure 3.3 shows the expected contribution from the HI\nfluctuations (HF) to the individual visibilities for GMRT and MWA. Note that while\nthis can be considerably larger than the signal that we are trying to detect (particularly\nwhen the bubble size is small), there is a big difference between the two. The signal\nfrom the bubble is correlated across different baselines and frequency channels whereas\nthe contribution from random HI fluctuations is uncorrelated at different baselines and\nit become uncorrelated beyond a certain frequency separation \u2206\u03bd (Bharadwaj & Ali,\n2005; Datta, Choudhury & Bharadwaj, 2007).\n\n3.2.3 Noise and foregrounds\n~ , \u03bd) in each baseline and frequency channel is exThe system noise contribution N(U\npected to be an independent Gaussian random variable with zero mean (hN\u0302i = 0) and\n~ and \u03bdc .

The rms noise is reduced by a factor \u2206t/tobs if we average over tobs /\u2206t\n\nindependent observations where tobs is the total observation time. Figure 3.3 shows the\nexpected noise for a single baseline at 153MHz for \u2206\u03bdc = 50 KHz and an observation\ntime of 100 hrs for both the GMRT and MWA. Though Tsys is nearly equal for the GMRT\nand the MWA, the noise in a single baseline is expected to be 60 times larger for MWA\nthan that for the GMRT. This is a because the individual antennas have a much larger\ncollecting area at the GMRT as compared to the MWA. The fact that the MWA has\nmany more antennas (N = 500) as compared to the GMRT (N = 30) compensates for\nthis. Note that nearly half (16) of the GMRT antennas are at very large baselines which\nare not particularly sensitive to the signal on the angular scales the ionized bubble, and\nonly the other 14 antennas in the 1 km \u00d7 1 km central square will contribute towards\ndetecting the signal. For both the GMRT and the MWA, Tsys is dominated by the sky\ncontribution Tsky with the major contribution coming from our Galaxy. We expect Tsys\nto vary depending on whether the source is in the Galactic plane or away from it. The\nvalue which we have used is typical for directions off the Galactic plane. Further, the\nnoise contribution will also be baseline dependent which is not included in our analysis.\nContributions from astrophysical foregrounds are expected to be several order of\n\n50\n\n\f3.2 Different Sources that Contribute to Low Frequency Radio Observations\nmagnitude stronger than the HI signal.

Scut depends on \u03c3 the rms. noise in the image.

For tobs = 100 hrs and B = 6 MHz we have Scut = 0.1mJy for the GMRT and using\nB = 32 MHz it gives Scut = 0.2 mJy for the MWA. The value of Scut will be smaller for\nlonger observations, but reducing Scut any further does not make any difference to our\nresults so we hold Scut fixed at these values for the rest of our analysis. The confusion\nnoise from the unresolved point sources is a combination of two parts, the Poisson\ncontribution due to the discrete nature of these sources and the clustering contribution.\nThe amplitude of these two contributions have different Scut dependence. The parameter\nvalues that we have used are listed in Table 3.1. We have adopted the parameter\nvalues from Santos, Cooray & Knox (2005) and incorporated the Scut dependence from\nDiMatteo. et al.

For all\nvalues of U, the foregrounds are at least four orders of magnitude larger than the signal,\nand also considerably larger than the noise.\nThe MWA has been designed with the detection of the statistical HI fluctuation signal\nin mind, and hence it is planned to have a very large field of view. The foreground\ncontribution to a single baseline is expected to be 10 times stronger for the MWA\nthan for the GMRT because of a larger field of view. As we shall show later, the\nincreased foreground contribution is not a limitation for detecting HII bubbles.

In contrast, the signal from an ionized bubble peaks\nat a frequency corresponding to the bubble center and falls rapidly with \u2206\u03bd (Figure 3.2).\nThis holds the promise of allowing the signal to be separated from the foregrounds.\n\n53\n\n\f3 Detecting Ionized Bubbles in Redshifted 21 cm Maps\n1e+06\n\n1e+06\n\nFG\n\nGMRT\n\nFG\nt\n\n10000\n\nobs = 100 hrs , \u2206 \u03bd c = 50 KHz\n\nMWA\n\nt\n\n10000\n\nobs =\n\n100 hrs , \u2206 \u03bd c = 50 KHz\n\nVisibility mJy\n\nNS\n100\n\n100\n\nNS\n\nHF\n\nSignal ( 50 Mpc )\nHF\n\n1\n\n1\n\nSignal ( 50 Mpc )\n\nSignal ( 10 Mpc )\n\n0.01\n\nSignal ( 10 Mpc )\n\n0.01\n\n1e\u221204\n\n1e\u221204\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\nU\n\nU\n\n~ , \u03bd) at \u03bd =\nFigure 3.3: The magnitude of the different contributions to the visibility V (U\n153 MHz as a function of U.

The HI signal from an ionized bubble, if it is present in the\ndata, will be buried in foregrounds and noise both of which are expected to be much\nlarger. In this Section we present a filtering technique aimed at detecting the signal\nfrom an ionized bubble if it is present in our observations. To detect the signal from an\nionized bubble of radius Rb with center at redshift zc (or frequency \u03bdc ) and at an angle\n~\u03b8c from the center of the field of view, we introduce an estimator \u00ca[Rb , zc , ~\u03b8c ] defined as\n\n\u00ca =\n\n\"\nX\na,b\n\n# \"\n#\nX\n~ a , \u03bdb )V\u0302 (U\n~ a , \u03bdb ) /\nSf\u2217 (U\n1\n\n(3.13)\n\na,b\n\n~ , \u03bd) is a filter which has been constructed to detect the particular ionized\nwhere Sf (U\n~ a and \u03bdb refer to the different baselines and frequency channels in our\nbubble.

We consider two different filters which reduce the foreground\ncontribution, but it occurs at the expense of reducing the SNR, and tobs would be more\nthan that predicted by eq.

The\nsize distribution of HII regions are quite uncertain, and would depend on the reionization history and the distribution of ionizing sources. However, there are some indications in the literature on what could be the typical size of HII regions. For example, Wyithe, Loeb & Barnes (2005) deduce from proximity zone effects that Rb \u2248\n35 Mpc at z \u2248 6, which should be considered as a lower limit. On the other hand,\nFurlanetto, McQuinn & Hernquist (2006) (Figure 1(a)) infer that the characteristic bubble size Rb > 10 Mpc at z = 8 if the ionized fraction xi > 0.75 (Rb \u223c 50Mpc if xi \u223c 0.9).\nTheoretical models which match a variety of observations (Choudhury & Ferrara, 2007)\nimply that xi could be as high as 90 % at z \u223c 8, which would mean bubble sizes of\n\u223c 40 \u2212 50 Mpc. To allow for the large variety of possibilities, we have presented results\nfor a wide range of Rb values from 2 Mpc to 50 Mpc. We restrict our analysis to a\nsituation where the IGM outside the bubble is completely neutral (xHI = 1).

This holds at\nthe baseline distribution is uniform ie. \u03c1N (U\nU < 300 for the GMRT (Figure 3.5), and the expected scaling is seen for Rb \u2265 20 Mpc.\nFor smaller bubbles the signal extends to larger baselines where \u03c1N (U, \u03bd) falls sharply,\nand the signal and the noise both have a steeper Rb dependence. The MWA baseline\ndistribution is flat for only a small U range (Figure 3.5) beyond which it drops. In this\ncase the signal and noise are found to scale as Rb4 and Rb2 respectively.

Note that Filter II is more efficient in foreground subtraction, but it requires prior\nknowledge about the frequency dependence. For both the filters the foreground removal\nis more effective at the GMRT than the MWA because of the frequency dependence of\n~ , \u03bd). The assumption that this is proportional to \u03bb2 is valid only when \u03c1(U,\n~ \u03bd) is\n\u03c1N (U\nindependent of U, which, as we have discussed, is true for a large U range at the GMRT.\nThe \u03bb dependence is much more complicated at the MWA, but we have not considered\nsuch details here as the foreground contribution is anyway smaller than the signal. It\nshould also be noted that the foreground contribution increases at small baselines (eq.\n3.10), and is very sensitive to the smallest value of U which we set at U = 20 for our\ncalculations. Here it must be noted that our results are valid only under the assumption\nthat the foregrounds have a smooth frequency dependence. A slight deviation from this\nand the signal will be swamped by the foregrounds. Also note that this filtering method\nis effective only for the detection of the bubbles and not for the statistical HI fluctuations\nsignal.\nThe contribution from the HI fluctuations impose a lower limit on the size of the\nbubble which can be detected. However long be the observing time, it will not be\npossible to detect bubbles of size Rb < 8 Mpc using the GMRT and size Rb < 16 Mpc\n\n65\n\n\f3 Detecting Ionized Bubbles in Redshifted 21 cm Maps\nusing the MWA. The HI fluctuation contribution increases at small baselines. The\nproblem is particularly severe at MWA because of the dense sampling of the small\nbaselines and the very large field of view. We note that the MWA is being designed\nwith the detection of the statistical HI fluctuation signal in mind, and hence it is not\nsurprising that this contribution is quite large. For both telescopes it may be possible to\nreduce this component by cutting off the filter at small baselines. We have not explored\nthis possibility in this work because the enormous observing times required to detect\nsuch small bubbles makes it unfeasible with the GMRT or MWA.\nFigure 3.8 shows the observation time that would be required to detect bubbles of\ndifferent sizes using Filter I for GMRT and the MWA. Note that the observing time\nshown here refers to a 3 \u03c3 detection which is possibly adequate for targeted searches\ncentered on observed quasar position. A more stringent detection criteria at the 5 \u03c3\nlevel would be apropriate for a blind search. The observing time would go up by a factor\nof 3 for a 5 \u03c3 detection. The observing time is similar for Filter II and hence we do not\nshow this separately. In calculating the observing time we have only taken into account\nthe noise contribution as the other contributions do not change with time. The value of\nRb below which a detection is not possible due to the HI fluctuations is shown by vertical\nlines for both telescopes. We see that with 100 hrs of observation both the telescopes\nwill be able to detect bubbles with Rb > 40 Mpc while bubbles with Rb > 22Mpc can\nbe detected with 1000 hrs of observation.\nThe possibility of detecting a bubble is less when the bubble centre does not coincide\n2\n\n2\n\nwith the centre of the field of view. In fact, the SNR falls as e\u2212\u03b8c /\u03b80 if the bubble center\nis shifted away by \u03b8c from the center of the field of view and the filter is also shifted so\nthat its center coincides with that of the bubble. There will be a corresponding increase\n2\n\n2\n\ntobs \u221d e2\u03b8c /\u03b80 in the observing time required to detect the bubble.

The results are shown for different bubble sizes.\nthe required observing time increases rapidly with \u03b8c for off-centered bubbles.\nWhen searching for bubbles in a particular observation it will be necessary to consider\nfilters corresponding to all possible value of Rb , \u03bdc and ~\u03b8c . A possible strategy would\nbe to search at a discrete set of values in the range of Rb , \u03bdc and ~\u03b8c values where a\ndetection is feasible. The crucial issue here would be the choice of the sampling density\nso that we do not miss out an ionized bubble whose parameters do not exactly coincide\nwith any of the values in the discrete set and lie somewhere in between. To illustrate\nthis we discuss the considerations for choosing and optimal value of \u2206\u03b8c the sampling\ninterval for ~\u03b8c . We use h\u00cai[\u2206\u03b8] to denote the expectation value of the estimator when\nthere is a mismatch \u2206\u03b8 between the centers of the bubble and the filter. The ratio\nOverlap = h\u00cai[\u2206\u03b8]/h\u00cai[0], shown in Figure 3.9 for GMRT (left panel) and MWA (right\npanel), quantifies the overlap between the signal and the filter as \u2206\u03b8 is varied. We see\nthat the choice of \u2206\u03b8 would depend on the size of the bubble we are trying to detect and\nit would be smaller for the GMRT as compared to the MWA. Permitting the Overlap\n\u2032\n\nto drop to 0.9 at the middle of the sampling interval, we find that it is 8 at the GMRT\n\u2032\n\nand 20 at the MWA for Rb = 50 Mpc.\nThe MWA is yet to be constructed, and it may be possible that an antennae distribu-\n\n68\n\n\f3.4 Results and Discussions\n\n.\n\nhrs\n\n1e+08\n1e+07\n\n1/ r\n\n1e+06\n\n1/ r 2\n1/ r 3\n\nobs\n\n100000\n\nt\n\n10000\n1000\n100\n10\n\n.\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nR Mpc\n\nFigure 3.10: Same as the Figure 3.8 considering three different antenna distributions\n\u03c1ant (r) \u221d 1/r, 1/r 2 , 1/r 3 for the MWA.\n\n69\n\n\f3 Detecting Ionized Bubbles in Redshifted 21 cm Maps\ntion different from \u03c1ant (r) \u221d 1/r 2, may improve the prospects of detecting HII bubbles.\nWe have tried out \u03c1ant (r) \u221d 1/r and 1/r 3 for which the results are shown in Figure 3.10.\nWe find that the required integration time falls considerably for the 1/r 3 distribution\nwhereas the opposite occurs for 1/r. For example, for Rb = 50 Mpc the integration time\nincreases by 5 times for 1/r and decreases by 3 times for 1/r 3 as compared to 1/r 2 .\nBased on this we expect the integration time to come down if the antenna distribution\nis made steeper, but this occurs at the expense of increasing the HI fluctuations and the\nforegrounds. We note that for the 1/r 3 distribution the foreground contribution is more\nthan the signal, but it may be possible to overcome this by modifying the filter. The\nincrease in the HI fluctuations is inevitable, and it restricts the smallest bubble that\ncan be detected to R = 26 MPc for 1/r 3. In summary, the 1/r 2 distribution appears\nto be a good compromise between reducing the integration time and increasing the HI\nfluctuations and foregrounds.\nFinally we examine some of the assumptions made in this work. First, the Fourier\nrelation between the specific intensity and the visibilities (eq. 3.1) will be valid only near\nthe center of the field of view and full three dimensional wide-field imaging is needed\naway from the center. As the feasibility of detecting a bubble away from the center falls\nrapidly, we do not expect the wide-field effects to be very important. Further, these\neffects are most significant at large baselines whereas most of the signal from ionized\nbubbles is in the small baselines.\nInhomogeneities in the IGM will affect the propagation of ionization fronts, and\nthe ionized bubbles are not expected to be exactly spherical (Wyithe, Loeb & Barnes,\n2005). This will cause a mismatch between the signal and the filter which in turn will\ndegrade the SNR. In addition to this, in future we plan to address a variety of other\nissues like considering different observing frequencies and making predictions for the\nother upcoming telescopes.\n\n70\n\n\f3.4 Results and Discussions\nTerrestrial signals from television, FM radio, satellites, mobile communication etc.,\ncollectively referred to as RFI, fall in the same frequency band as the redshifted 21cm\nsignal from the reionization epoch. These are expected to be much stronger than the\nexpected 21cm signal, and it is necessary to quantify and characterize the RFI. Recently\nBowman et al. (2007) have characterized the RFI for the MWA site on the frequency\nrange 80 to 300MHz. They find an excellent RFI environment except for a few channels\nwhich are dominated by satellite communication signal. The impact of RFI on detecting\nionized bubbles is an important issue which we plan to address in future.\nThe effect of polarization leakage is another issue we postpone for future work. This\ncould cause polarization structures on the sky to appear as frequency dependent ripples\nin the foregrounds intensity . This could be particularly severe for the MWA.\n\n71\n\n\f3 Detecting Ionized Bubbles in Redshifted 21 cm Maps\n\n72\n\n\f4 Simulating Matched Filter Search\nfor Ionized Bubbles\u2217\n\n4.1 Introduction\nIn the previous Chapter we present an analytic framework for predicting the expected\nvalue and the standard deviation \u03c3 of the matched filter estimator for the detection of a\nspherical ionized bubble of comoving radius Rb . We identify three different contributions\nto \u03c3, namely foregrounds, system noise and the fluctuations in the HI outside the bubble\nthat we are trying to detect. Our analysis shows that the matched filter effectively\nremoves the foreground contribution so that it falls below the signal. Considering the\nsystem noise for the GMRT and the MWA we find that a 3 \u03c3 detection will be possible for\n\u2217\n\nThis Chapter is adapted from the paper \"Simulating the impact of HI fluctuations on\nmatched filter search for ionized bubbles in redshifted 21 cm maps\" by Datta et al.\n(2008).\n\n73\n\n\f4 Simulating Matched Filter Search for Ionized Bubbles\na bubble of comoving radius Rb \u2265 40 Mpc in 100 hrs of observation and Rb \u2265 22 Mpc in\n1000 hrs of observation for both the instruments. The HI fluctuations, we find, impose a\nfundamental restriction on bubble detection. Under the assumption that the HI outside\nthe ionized bubble traces the dark matter we find that it is not possible to detect bubble\nof size Rb \u2264 8 Mpc and Rb \u2264 16 Mpc at the GMRT and MWA respectively. Note that\nthe matched filter technique is valid for both, a targeted search around QSOs as well as\nfor a blind search in a random direction.\nHere we validate the visibility based matched filter technique introduced in the previous Chapter through simulations of bubble detection. Our simulations are capable\nof handling interferometric arrays with widely different configurations like the GMRT\nand the MWA , the two instruments that we consider here. As mentioned earlier, the\nfluctuations in the HI outside the target bubble impose a fundamental restriction for\nbubble detection. The analytic approach of the Chapter 3 assumes that the HI outside\nthe bubble traces the dark matter. In this Chapter we carry out simulations that incorporate this assumption and use these to assess the impact of HI fluctuations for bubble\ndetection. We also use the simulations to determine the accuracy to which the GMRT\nand the MWA will be able to determine the size and the position of an ionized bubble,\nand test if this is limited due to the presence of HI fluctuations. In a real situation a\ntypical FoV is expected to contain several ionized patches besides the one that we are\ntrying to detect. We use simulations to assess the impact of HI fluctuations for bubble\ndetection in patchy reionization scenarios.\nThe outline of the Chapter is as follows. Section 4.2 presents a brief description of how\nwe simulate 21-cm maps for three different scenarios of the HI distribution, one where the\nHI traces the dark matter and two with patchy reionization. Subsections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2\nrespectively discuss how the simulated maps are converted into visibilities and how the\nmatched filter analysis is simulated. We present our results in Section 4.3. Subsections\n\n74\n\n\f4.2 Method of Simulation\n4.3.1, 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 present results for bubble detectability, size determination and\nposition determination under the assumption that the HI outside the bubble traces the\ndark matter. Section 4.3.4 presents results for bubble detectability in patchy reionization\nscenarios. We discuss redshift dependence of bubble detection in Section 4.4 and present\nour summary in Section 4.5.\nFor the GMRT we have used the telescope parameters from their website, while for\nthe MWA we use the telescope parameters from Bowman et al. (2006). The cosmological\nparameters for a flat (k = 0) \u039bCDM model used throughout this paper are \u03a9m =\n0.3, \u03a9b h2 = 0.022, ns = 1., h = 0.74, \u03c38 = 1.\n\n4.2 Method of Simulation\nWe have simulated the detection of the HI signal of an ionized bubble whose center is\nat redshift zc = 6 which corresponds to \u03bdc = 203 MHz. The choice of z value is guided\nby the fact that we expect large ionized regions towards the end of reionization z & 6\n(Wyithe & Loeb, 2004; Furlanetto, McQuinn & Hernquist, 2006). Our aim here is to\nvalidate the analytic calculations of the Chapter 3 and hence the exact value of z is not\nvery important.\nWe consider four scenarios of reionization for bubble detection. In the first three\nscenarios there is a spherical ionized bubble, the one that we are trying to detect, at\nthe center of the FoV. This bubble has comoving radius Rb and is embedded in HI that\ntraces the dark matter. In the first scenario there is a single bubble in the field of view.\nWe refer to this as the SB scenario. In this scenario the HI fraction xHI is assumed to be\nuniform outside the bubble. The uncertainty due to the HI fluctuations is expected to be\nlowest in this scenario because of the absence of patchiness. This is the most optimistic\nscenario for bubble detection.\n\n75\n\n\f4 Simulating Matched Filter Search for Ionized Bubbles\nIn the next two scenarios, we attempt to quantify the effect of patchy reionization\n(PR) outside the bubble that we are trying to detect by introducing many other, possibly overlapping, bubbles in the FoV. Unfortunately, there is no obvious way to fix\nthe sizes of these bubbles from any theoretical models as they depend crucially on the\nnature of reionization sources and other physical factors. In scenario PR1, we assume\nthat the large HII regions which we are trying to detect are surrounded by many small\nionized regions whose sizes are fixed by the following procedure: we assume the globally\naveraged neutral fraction xHI to be \u223c 0.5; the reason for this choice is that the effects of\npatchiness would be most prominent when typically half of the IGM is ionized. Given\nthe value of xHI , we try to obtain a reasonable estimate of the size of the background\nbubbles from available models. For example, semi-numeric simulations of patchy reionization (Mesinger & Furlanetto, 2007) predict that the bubble size distribution peaks\naround 5 Mpc when xHI = 0.61 (see their Fig 6). We thus choose the spherical background bubbles to have radii 6 Mpc and compute the number of background bubbles by\ndemanding that the resulting neutral fraction is 0.5. The bubble centres are chosen such\nthat they trace the underlying dark matter distribution. At the end, the value of xHI\nturns out to be slightly higher 0.62 because of overlap of the bubbles. Note that because\nof these overlaps, the shapes of the resulting ionized regions would not always be perfectly spherical. In this scenario, we have essentially attempted to capture a situation\nwhere there are many small, possibly overlapping ionized regions produced by galaxies\nand a few large ionized regions (like the one that we are trying to detect) produced by\nQSOs.\nSince the choice of the background bubble size is not robust by any means, we\nconsider a different scenario PR2 where these bubbles have the same comoving radius\nRb as the bubble that we are trying to detect. The centers of these extra bubbles trace\nthe dark matter distribution as in PR1. The number of bubbles is fixed by the globally\n\n76\n\n\f4.2 Method of Simulation\naveraged xHI which we take to be 0.62 same as in PR1. The PR2 scenario represents\na situation where we predominantly have large ionized regions produced either by rare\nluminous sources or through the overlap of several small ionized regions in the later\nstages of reionization.\nA particle-mesh (PM) N-body code was used to simulate the dark matter distribution.\nIn the Chapter 3 we show that the HI signal of the ionized bubble is largely concentrated\nat small baselines or large angular scales, thus a very high spatial resolution is not\nrequired. We have used a grid spacing of 2 Mpc for the simulations. This is adequate\nfor bubbles in the range 4 \u2264 Rb \u2264 50 Mpc that we consider. The simulations use 2563\nparticles on a 2563 mesh. For the GMRT a single N-body simulation was cut into 8 equal\ncubes of size 256 Mpc on each side. Considering that each cube may be viewed along\nthree different directions, we have a total of 24 different realization of the dark matter\ndistribution. Each cube corresponds to 18 MHz in frequency and \u223c 2\u25e6 in angle which\nis comparable to the GMRT FoV which has FWHM=1.7\u25e6 at 203MHz. The MWA FoV\nis much larger (FWHM=13\u25e6 ). Here eight independent N-body simulations were used.\nViewing these along three different directions gives twenty four different realizations of\nthe dark matter distribution. Limited computer memory restricts the simulation size\n\u25e6\n\nand the angular extent (\u223c 4 ) is considerably smaller than the MWA FoV. We do not\nexpect this to affect the signal but the contribution from the HI fluctuations outside the\nbubble is possibly underestimated for the MWA.\nThe dark matter density contrast \u03b4 was used to calculate the redshifted 21 \u2212 cm\nspecific intensity I\u03bd = I \u0304\u03bd xHI (1 + \u03b4) for each grid point of our simulation. Here I \u0304\u03bd =\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\u0010 H \u0011\n0.7\n2 Jy \u03a9b h2\n0\nand xHI the hydrogen neutral fraction is 0 inside the\n2.5 \u00d7 10 sr 0.02\nh\nH(z)\nionized bubbles and 1 outside. The simulated boxes are transformed to frequency and\n\nsky coordinate. Figure 4.1 shows the HI image on a slice through the center of the\nbubble of radius Rb = 20 Mpc. The mean neutral fraction x\u0304HI is \u223c 1 in the SB scenario,\n\n77\n\n\f4 Simulating Matched Filter Search for Ionized Bubbles\n\nFigure 4.1: This shows HI images on slices through the center of the bubble for the\nfour different scenarios SB, PR1, PR2 and SM (from left to right). In first\nthree panels the central, circular dark region of radius Rb = 20 Mpc shows\nthe HII bubble that we are trying to detect. The HI outside this bubble\ntraces the dark matter distribution. In the SB scenario(left) the hydrogen\nneutral fraction is xHI = 1 outside the bubble. In the PR1 scenario (2nd\nfrom left) the extra bubbles are all of a fixed comoving radius 6 Mpc. In\nthe PR2 scenario (3rd from left) the extra bubbles have the same comoving\nradius as the bubble that we are trying to detect. In both the PR1 and PR2\nreionization scenarios the centers of the extra bubbles trace the dark matter\ndistribution and xHI = 0.62. In the SM scenario (right) the central region\nup to radius 27 Mpc is fully ionized (marked with solid circle) and beyond\nthat region up to radius 42 Mpc the region is partially filled with HI patches\n(dashed circle). The mean neutral fraction is xHI = 0.5. These simulations\nare all for the GMRT.\nwhile it is \u223c 0.62 for the two PR simulations shown here.\nThe three scenarios discussed above consider only spherical bubbles, and the only\ndepartures from sphericity arise from bubble overlap. It is important to assess how\nwell our bubble detection technique works for non-spherical bubbles, which we do using\nionization maps produced by the semi-numeric (SM) approach. In particular, we use\nmaps obtained by the method of Choudhury, Haehnelt & Regan (2008). Essentially,\nthese maps are produced by incorporating an excursion-set based technique for identifying ionized regions given the density distribution and the ionizing sources (Zahn et al.,\n2007; Mesinger & Furlanetto, 2007; Geil & Wyithe, 2008). In addition, the method of\nChoudhury, Haehnelt & Regan (2008) incorporate inhomogeneous recombination and\nself-shielding of high-density regions so that it is consistent with the \"photons-starved\"\n\n78\n\n\f4.2 Method of Simulation\n\nreionization scenario implied by the Ly\u03b1 forest data (Bolton & Haehnelt, 2007; Choudhury, Ferrara\n2008). We use a simulation box of size 270 Mpc with 20003 particles which can resolve\ncollapsed halos as small as \u2248 109 M\u2299 . The ionization maps are generated at a much lower\nresolution with a grid size of 2.7 Mpc. The box corresponds to 19 MHz in frequency\nand \u223c 2\u25e6 in angle comparable to the GMRT FoV. We have assigned luminosities to the\ncollapsed halos such that the mean neutral fraction xHI = 0.5. The most massive halo\n(mass \u223c 1013 M\u2299 ) identified in the box is made to coincide with the box centre and we\nassume that it hosts a luminous QSO; its luminosity and age are chosen such that it\nwould produce a spherical HII region of comoving size \u2248 27 Mpc in a completely homogeneous neutral medium [see, e.g., equation (8) of Geil & Wyithe (2008)]. However,\nthe actual ionized region is far from spherical both because of the surrounding bubbles\nfrom other halos and also because of inhomogeneous recombination. We find visually\nfrom the maps (see the rightmost panel of Figure 4.1) that the HII region is fully ionized\nup to radius \u2248 27 Mpc. Beyond that the region is partially filled with neutral patches.\nThis patchy ionized region extends up to radius \u223c 42 Mpc and then merges with the\naverage IGM. The fully ionized region and the region with HI patches are marked with\ntwo circles. We use this box for GMRT as three independent realizations viewing the\nbox along three different directions. For the MWA we need a much larger simulation\nbox which requires substantially more computing power, beyond the resources available\nto us at present. Hence we do not consider the MWA for this scenario.\n\n79\n\n\f4 Simulating Matched Filter Search for Ionized Bubbles\n\n4.2.1 Simulating visibilities\n\n~ , \u03bd)\nThe quantity measured in radio-interferometric observations is the visibility V (U\nwhich is related to the specific intensity pattern on the sky I\u03bd (~\u03b8) as\n~ , \u03bd) =\nV (U\n\nZ\n\n~~\n\nd2 \u03b8A(~\u03b8)I\u03bd (~\u03b8)e2\u03c0\u0131\u03b8*U\n\n(4.1)\n\n~ denotes the antenna separation d~ projected in the plane\n~ = d/\u03bb\nHere the baseline U\nperpendicular to the line of sight in units of the observing wavelength \u03bb, \u03b8~ is a two\ndimensional vector in the plane of the sky with origin at the center of the FoV, and\nA(~\u03b8) is the beam pattern of the individual antenna.

The MWA\nbeam pattern is expected to be quite complicated, and depends on the pointing angle\nrelative to the zenith (Bowman et al., 2007). Our analysis largely deals with the beam\npattern within 2\u25e6 of the pointing angle where it is reasonable to approximate the beam\nas being circularly symmetric (Figures 3 and 5 of Bowman et al. 2007 ).

The\nhigh computational requirement restricts us to use just 3 realizations for the SM scenario.\nOnly the signal is correlated with the filter, and only this is expected to contribute to\nthe mean h\u00cai. All the other components are uncorrelated with the filter and they are\nexpected to contribute only to the variance h(\u2206\u00ca)2 i. The variance is a sum of three\ncontributions (Chapter 3)\nh(\u2206\u00ca)2 i = h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iHF + h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iN + h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iF G .\n\n(4.7)\n\nThe simulations give an estimate of h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iHF the contribution from HI fluctuations.\nWe do not include system noise explicitly in our simulations. The noise contribution\nfrom a single visibility (eq. 4.3) is used to estimate h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iN (eq. 3.19 of Chapter\n3). Under the assumed foreground model, the foreground contribution h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iF G is\npredicted to be smaller than the signal and we do not consider it here.\n\n85\n\n\f4 Simulating Matched Filter Search for Ionized Bubbles\n\n4.3 Results\nWe first consider the detection of an ionized bubbles and the estimation of its parameters\nin the SB scenario where there is only a single bubble in the FoV. We consider the most\noptimistic situation where the bubble is located in the center. In reality this can only be\nachieved in targeted observations of ionized bubbles around luminous QSOs. In a blind\nsearch, the bubble in general will be located at some arbitrary position in the FoV, and\nnot the center. It has already been mentioned that the foregrounds can be removed by\na suitable choice of the filter. Further, the system noise can, in principle, be reduced\nby increasing the observation time. The HI fluctuations outside the bubble impose a\nfundamental restriction on bubble detection.\n\n4.3.1 Restriction on bubble detection\nWe have carried out simulations for different values of the bubble radius Rb chosen\nuniformly at an interval of 2 Mpc in the range 4 to 50 Mpc. In each case we consider\nonly the most optimistic situation where the bubble radius Rf used in the filter is\nprecisely matched to Rb . In reality it is necessary to try filters of different radius Rf to\ndetermine which gives the best match.\nFigures 4.4 and 4.5 shows the results for the GMRT and the MWA respectively. We\ncompare the analytic predictions of the Chapter 3 (left panel) with the prediction of\nour simulations (right panel). The analytical predictions for the mean value h\u00cai arising\nq\ndue to the HI fluctuations are respectively calculated\nfrom the signal and h(\u2206\u00ca)2 i\nHF\n\nusing equations (3.15) and (3.22) of the Chapter 3. The signal depends on the bubble\nradius Rb and the mean neutral fraction which is taken to be xHI = 1. The uncertainty\ndue to the HI fluctuations is calculated using the dark matter power spectrum under\nthe assumption that the HI traces the dark matter.\n\n86\n\n\f4.3 Results\n\nFigure 4.4: The estimator \u00ca (defined in equation 4.4) for bubble size Rb ranging from\n4 Mpc to 50 Mpc for the GMRT in the SB scenario. It is assumed that the\nfilter is exactly matched to the bubble.

The\ndata points in the right panel show \u00ca in the individual realizations.\n\nFigure 4.5: Same as the Figure 4.4 for the MWA.\n\n87\n\n\f4 Simulating Matched Filter Search for Ionized Bubbles\n\nWe find that h\u00cai and\n\nq\n\nh(\u2206\u00ca)2 i\n\nHF\n\ndetermined from the simulations is in rough\n\nagreement with the analytic predictions. The mean h\u00cai is in very good agreement for\nRb > 6 Mpc, there is a slight discrepancy for smaller bubbles arising from the finite\nq\nare somewhat\ngrid size (2 Mpc in the simulation). The HI fluctuations h(\u2206\u00ca)2 i\nHF\n\nunderestimated by the simulations. This is more pronounced for the MWA where the\nlimited box size of our simulations results in a FoV which is considerably smaller than\nthe actual antennas. We note that the 24 different values of \u00ca determined from the\nq\ndifferent realizations of the simulation all lie within h\u00cai \u00b1 3 h(\u2206\u00ca)2 i\ndetermined\nHF\n\nfrom the analytic predictions.\n\nThe good agreement between the simulation results and the analytical predictions is\nparticularly important because each is based on several approximations, many of which\ndiffer between the two methods. Our results show that the effect of these approximations,\nthough present, are well under control. The analytical method has the advantage that\nit is very easy to calculate and can be evaluated very quickly at an extremely low\ncomputational cost. Unfortunately, its utility is mainly limited to the SB scenario and it\ncannot be easily applied to an arbitrary PR scenario with a complicated HI distribution.\nSimulations, though computationally more cumbersome and expensive, are useful in\nsuch a situation. It is thus important to test that the two methods agree for the SB\nscenario where both of them can be applied. Note that the HI fluctuation predicted by\nthe SB scenario sets the lower limit for the HI fluctuation in any of the PR models. It\nis expected that patchiness will increase the HI fluctuations above the SB predictions.\nIt is meaningful to attempt bubble detection at, say 3\u03c3 confidence level, only if\nq\nh\u00cai \u2265 3 h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iHF . The HI fluctuations overwhelm the signal in a situation where\nthis condition is not satisfied, and bubble detection is not possible. In a situation where\n\nthis condition is satisfied, an observed value Eo of the estimator can be interpreted as\n\n88\n\n\f4.3 Results\nq\na 3\u03c3 detection if Eo > 3 h(\u2206\u00ca)2 i. The simulations show that a 3 \u2212 \u03c3 detection is not\npossible for Rb \u2264 6 Mpc and Rb \u2264 12 Mpc at the GMRT and MWA respectively. As\n\nnoted earlier, the HI fluctuations are somewhat under predicted in the simulations and\nthe analytic predictions Rb \u2264 8 Mpc and Rb \u2264 16 Mpc respectively, are somewhat larger.\nThe limitation on the bubble size Rb that can be detected is larger for the MWA as\ncompared to the GMRT. This is because of two reasons, the first being the fact that\nthe MWA has a very dense sampling of the small baselines where the HI fluctuation\nare very large, and the second being the large FoV. In fact, the baseline distribution of\nthe experiment has a significant role in determining the quantum of HI fluctuations and\nthereby determining the lower cut-off for bubble detection. Looking for an optimum\nbaseline distribution for bubble detection is also an issue which we plan to address in\nfuture. In a situation where the antenna layout is already in place, it may possible to\ntune the filter to reduce the HI fluctuations.\nWe have not considered the effect of peculiar velocities (Bharadwaj & Ali, 2004) in\nour simulations. From equation (3.22) of the Chapter 3 we see that the HI fluctuaq\n\u221a\ntions scale as h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iHF \u221d Cl , where Cl is the HI multi-frequency angular power\n\nspectrum (MAPS). The Cl s increase by a factor \u223c 2 due to peculiar velocities, whereby\nq\nh(\u2206\u00ca)2 iHF goes up by a factor \u223c 1.5. This increase does not significantly change our\n\nresults, and is small compared to the other uncertainties in the PR models.\nq\nThe signal h\u00cai and the HI fluctuations h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iHF both scale as \u221d x\u0304HI , and the\n\nlower limit for bubble detection is unchanged for smaller neutral fractions.\n\n4.3.2 Size determination\nIn this subsection we estimate the accuracy to which it will be possible to determine the\nbubble radius Rb . This, in general, is an unknown quantity that has to be determined\n\n89\n\n\f4 Simulating Matched Filter Search for Ionized Bubbles\nfrom the observation by trying out filters with different values of Rf . In the matched\nfilter technique we expect the predicted SNR (only system noise) ratio\n\nSNR = q\n\nh\u00cai\nh(\u2206\u00ca)2 i\n\n(4.8)\nNS\n\nto peak when the filter is exactly matched to the signal ie. Rf = Rb . The solid line\nin the right panel of Figure 4.6 shows this for Rb = 10 Mpc. We find that the SNR\npeaks exactly when the filter size Rf = 10 Mpc. We propose that this can be used to\nobservationally determine Rb . For varying Rf , we consider the ratio of the observed\nq\nvalue Eo to the expected system noise h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iNS, referring to this as the SNR. The\n\nRf value where this SNR peaks gives an estimate of the actual bubble size Rb . The\n\nobserved SNR will differ from the predictions of eq. (4.8) due to the HI fluctuations\noutside the bubble. These variations will differ from realization to realization and this\ncan introduce uncertainties in size estimation. We have used the simulations to estimate\nthis.\nThe left panel of Figure 4.6 shows the SNR as a function of Rf for 4 different realizations of the simulation for the GMRT with bubble size Rb = 10 Mpc. We see that for\nRf \u2264 Rb the SNR shows a very similar behavior in all the realizations, and it always\npeaks around 10 Mpc as expected. For Rf > Rb the behavior of the SNR as a function of\nRf shows considerable variation across the realizations. In some cases the drop in SNR\naway from the peak is quite rapid whereas in others it is very gradual (for example, the\ndashed-dot-dot curve). In many cases there is an spurious extra peak in the SNR at an\nRf value that is much larger than Rb . These spurious peaks do not pose a problem for\nsize determination as they are well separated from Rb and can be easily distinguished\nfrom the genuine peak.\nThe error-bars in the right panel of Figure 4.6 show the 3 \u2212 \u03c3 fluctuation in the\n\n90\n\n\f4.3 Results\n\nq\nFigure 4.6: The SNR = h\u00cai/ h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iNS for 1000 hrs observation with the GMRT as\na function of the filter size Rf for the case where the actual bubble size is\nRb = 10 Mpc . The left panel shows 4 different realizations of the simulation.\nThe right panel shows the mean SNR and 3 \u2212 \u03c3 error-bars calculated using\n24 realizations. The solid line shows the analytical predictions.\n\n91\n\n\f4 Simulating Matched Filter Search for Ionized Bubbles\nsimulated SNR determined from 24 realizations of the simulation. Note that the fluctuations at different Rf are correlated. Although the overall amplitude changes from\none realization to another, the shape of the curve in the vicinity of Rf = Rb is nearly\ninvariant across all the realizations. In all of the 24 realizations we can identify a well\ndefined peak at the expected value Rf = Rb .\nFigures 4.7 and 4.8 show the results for a similar analysis with Rb = 20 Mpc for\nthe GMRT and the MWA respectively. It is not possible to detect a bubble of size\nRb = 10 Mpc with the MWA, and hence we do not show this. Here again,we find that\nfor all the realizations of the simulations the SNR peaks at Rf = Rb . The relative\nvariations in the SNR across the realizations is much less for Rb = 20 Mpc as compared\nto 10 Mpc and there are no spurious peaks. Also, for the same bubble size the variations\nare smaller for the GMRT as compared to the MWA. We do not find any spurious peaks\nfor Rb = 20 Mpc.\nA point to note is that the mean SNR determined from the simulations is somewhat\nsmaller than the analytic predictions, both being shown in the right panels of Figures\n4.6, 4.7 and Figure 4.8. There are a couple of reasons that could account for this namely,\n(i) the bubble in the simulation is not exactly a sphere because of the finite grid size and\nthus the match between the filter and the signal is not perfect even when the sizes are\nsame and (ii) the finite box-size imposes a minimum baseline beyond which the signal\nis not represented in the simulation.\nBased on our results we conclude that in the SB scenario for the GMRT the accuracy\nto which the bubble size can be determined in our simulations is decided by the resolution\n2 Mpc and not by the HI fluctuations. In reality the limitation will come from the angular\nresolution of the instrument which sets the limit at 0.5 Mpc for the GMRT and 8 Mpc\nfor the MWA.\n\n92\n\n\f4.3 Results\n\nFigure 4.7: Same as the Figure 4.6 for Rb = 20 Mpc for the GMRT.\nThe height of the SNR peak depends on the neutral fraction and it can be used\nto observationally determine this. We find that the HI fluctuations do not change the\nposition of the peak but introduce considerable variations in its height even if xHI = 1.\nThe HI fluctuations restrict the accuracy to which the neutral fraction can be estimated,\nan issue that we propose to address in future work.\n\n4.3.3 Determining the position\nIn the previous two subsections, we have considered cases where the bubble's position is\nknown. Here we assume that the bubble's size is known and we estimate the accuracy to\nwhich its position can be determined in the presence of HI fluctuations. The situation\nconsidered here is a blind search whereas the former is a targeted search centered on a\nQSO.\nIn a real situations it would be necessary to jointly determine four parameters the\nbubble radius Rb , two angular coordinates (\u03b8x , \u03b8y ) and the central frequency \u03bdc from\n\n93\n\n\f4 Simulating Matched Filter Search for Ionized Bubbles\n\nFigure 4.8: Same as the Figure 4.6 for Rb = 20 Mpc for the MWA.\nthe observation. However, to keep the computational requirement under control, in\nthis analysis we assume that Rb is known. The bubble is placed at the center of the\nFoV and frequency band, and we estimate how well the position can be recovered from\nthe simulation. To determine the bubble's position we move the center of the filter\nto different positions and search for a peak in the SNR. To reduce the computational\nrequirement, this is done along one direction at a time, keeping the other two directions\nfixed at the bubble's actual center. We have also carried out simulations where the\nbubble is located off-center. We do not explicitly show these results because they are\nexactly the same as when the bubble is at the center except for the fact that the value\nof the peak SNR is lower because of the primary beam pattern.\nFigure 4.9 shows the results for Rb = 10 Mpc for the GMRT. The left panel shows\nresults for 4 realizations of the simulation, the right panels show the mean and 3 \u2212 \u03c3\ndetermined from 24 realizations of the simulations and the analytic prediction for the\nmean value. In all cases a peak is seen at the expected position matched with the\nbubble's actual center. The HI fluctuations pose a severe problem for determining the\n\n94\n\n\f4.3 Results\n\nFigure 4.9: The SNR for 1000 hrs GMRT observations for a bubble of size Rb = 10 Mpc\nlocated at the center of the filed of view.

In some cases\nthese fluctuations are comparable to the peak at the bubble's actual position (see the\ndashed line in the upper left panel). The possibility of spurious peaks makes it difficult\nto reliably determine the bubble's position.\nWe present the results for Rb = 20 Mpc in Figures 4.10 and 4.11 for the GMRT\nand MWA respectively. The HI fluctuations do not pose a problem for determining the\nposition of such bubbles using the GMRT. In all the realizations of the GMRT simulations there is a peak at the expected position. The FWHM \u223c 40Mpc is approximately\nthe same along \u03b8x ,\u03b8y and \u03bdf and is comparable to the separation at which the overlap\nbetween the bubble and the filter falls to half the maximum value. The HI fluctuations\ndoes introduce spurious peaks, but these are quite separated from the actual peak and\nhave a smaller height. We do not expect these to be of concern for position estimation.\nThe MWA simulations all show a peak at the expected bubble position. The FWHM\nalong \u03b8 (\u223c 60 Mpc ) is somewhat broader than that along \u03bd (\u223c 40 Mpc). The low\nspatial resolution \u223c 8 Mpc possibly contributes to increase the FWHM along \u03b8. The\nHI fluctuations introduce spurious peaks whose heights are \u223c 50 % of the height of the\nactual peak.\n\n4.3.4 Bubble detection in patchy reionization\nThe SB scenario considered till now is the most optimistic scenario in which the HI\ntraces the dark matter. The presence of ionized patches other than the one that we are\ntrying to detect is expected to increase the contribution from HI fluctuations. We first\nconsider the PR1 scenario where there are several additional ionized bubbles of radius\n6 Mpc in the FoV. Figures 4.12 & 4.13 show the mean value of the estimator h\u00cai and\n3 \u2212 \u03c3 error-bars as a function of Rf for the GMRT and the MWA respectively. These\n\n96\n\n\f4.3 Results\n\nFigure 4.10: Same as the Figure 4.9 for Rb = 20 Mpc for the GMRT.\n\n97\n\n\f4 Simulating Matched Filter Search for Ionized Bubbles\n\nFigure 4.11: Same as the Figure 4.9 for Rb = 20 Mpc for the MWA.\n\n98\n\n\f4.3 Results\n\nFigure 4.12: The mean h\u00cai and 3 \u2212 \u03c3 error-bars of the estimator as a function of Rf for\nthe GMRT estimated from 24 different realizations of the PR1 scenario. In\nall cases the filter is exactly matched to the bubble.\nwere estimated from 24 different realizations of the simulation, using a filter exactly\nmatched to the bubble.\nWe find that the results are very similar to those for the SB scenario except that the\nsignal is down by 0.6 due to the lower neutral fraction (xHI = 0.62) in the PR scenarios.\nIonized bubbles with radius Rb = 8 Mpc and = 12 Mpc or smaller cannot be detected by\nthe GMRT and MWA respectively due to the HI fluctuations. These limits are similar\nto those obtained in simulations of the SB scenario.\nIn the PR2 scenario the FoV contains other ionized bubbles of the same size as the\nbubble that we are trying to detect. We find that bubble detection is not possible in\nsuch a situation, the HI fluctuations always overwhelm the signal. This result obviously\ndepends on number of other bubbles in the FoV, and this is decided by xHI which we\ntake to be 0.62. A detection may be possible at higher xHI where there would be fewer\nbubbles in the FoV.\n\n99\n\n\f4 Simulating Matched Filter Search for Ionized Bubbles\n\nFigure 4.13: Same as the Figure 4.12 for the MWA.\nIn the SM scenario, the very large computation time restricts us from generating\nseveral realizations with central ionized regions of different sizes. Hence we are unable\nto study the restriction on bubble detection. We have only three realizations all of which\nhave the same ionized region located at the center of the box. Based on these we find\nthat the mean estimator h\u00cai is \u223c 30 times larger that the standard deviation due to HI\nfluctuations. The detection of a bubble of the size present in our simulation (Figure 4.1)\nis not restricted by the HI fluctuations. We present size determination results in Figure\n4.14. We see that the SNR peaks at Rf = 42 Mpc and not at Rf = 27 Mpc. Recall that\nin the 21-cm map (Figure 4.1) we have visually identified the former as the bubble's outer\nradius which includes several small patchy ionized regions towards the periphery and the\nlatter is the inner radius which encloses the completely ionized region. We see that the\nmatched filter identifies the bubble's outer radius. To study the effect of non-sphericity\nwe compare our results in Figure 4.14 with the predictions for a spherical bubble of\nradius Rb = 42 Mpc embedded in uniform HI with the same neutral fraction xHI = 0.5.\n\n100\n\n\f4.3 Results\n\nFigure 4.14: Same as Figure 4.6 for the SM scenario for the GMRT. The dotted, dashed\ndotted and dashed lines show results for three different realizations. To\nshow the effect of non-sphericity, we compare these results with predictions\nfor a spherical bubble of sized Rb = 42 Mpc embedded in uniform HI with\nneutral fraction xHI = 0.5(solid line). The vertical line at Rf = 28 Mpc\nshows the radius up to which the bubble is fully ionized and the SNR\nfollows the spherical predictions. The SNR peaks at Rf = 42 Mpc marked\nby another vertical line.\n\n101\n\n\f4 Simulating Matched Filter Search for Ionized Bubbles\nWe find that our results for the SM scenario follow the spherical bubble prediction up\nto a filter size Rf = 28 Mpc (marked with a vertical line in Figure 4.14), corresponding\nto the bubble's inner radius which encloses a perfectly spherical ionized region. Beyond\nthis, and upto the outer radius of 42 Mpc, the HI is not fully ionized. There are neutral\npatches which introduce deviations from spherical symmetry and cause the SNR to fall\nbelow the predictions of a spherical bubble beyond Rf = 28 Mpc. The deviations from\nsphericity also broadens the peak in the SNR relative to the predictions for a spherical\nbubble.\nOur results based on the SM scenario show that the matched filter technique works\nwell for bubble detection and for determining the bubble's size even when there are deviations from sphericity. We obtain good estimates for the extents of both, the completely\nionized region and the partially ionized region. For the SM scenario, Figure 4.15 shows\nhow well the bubble's position can be determined in a blind search. We have followed\nthe same method as described for the SB scenario in subsection 3.3. We see that the\nSNR peaks at the expected position. Further, as the bubble size is quite large & 27 Mpc\nthere are no spurious peaks.\n\n4.4 Redshift Dependence\nResults shown so far are all at only one redshift z = 6. It would be interesting and useful\nto have predictions for higher redshifts. However, addressing this issue through direct\ncomputations at different redshifts would require considerable computation beyond the\nscope of this work. Since we find that the analytic predictions of the Chapter 3 are in\ngood agreement with the simulations of the SB scenario, we use the analytic formalism\nto predict how different quantities are expected to scale with increasing z.\nThe redshift dependence of some of the quantities like the system noise, the back-\n\n102\n\n\f4.4 Redshift Dependence\n\nFigure 4.15: Same as Figure 4.9 for the SM scenario for the GMRT. The x-axis shows\nthe comoving distance of the filter position from the center of the box. The\nthree curves respectively show results for a search along three \u03b8x , \u03b8y and \u03bd\naxes.\n\n103\n\n\f4 Simulating Matched Filter Search for Ionized Bubbles\nground 21-cm brightness I \u0304\u03bd , and the angular and frequency extent of a bubble of fixed\ncomoving radius causes the SNR to decrease with increasing z. On the other hand the\nz dependence of the neutral fraction, the baseline distribution function and the effective\nantenna collecting area acts to increase the SNR at higher redshifts. We find that with\nq\nincreasing z both h\u00cai and h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iHF decrease by nearly the same factor so that the\n\nrestriction on bubble detection does not change significantly at higher redshift in the\nSB scenario. Assuming that the neutral fraction does not change with z, the SNR for\nbubble detection decreases with increasing redshift, the change depending on the bubble\nsize. For example, for the GMRT at z = 10 the SNR decreases by a factor \u223c 7 and 6 for\nbubbles of size Rb = 10 and 20 Mpc respectively. For the MWA this factor is 3 for both\nthese bubble sizes. We expect a similar change in the SNR for the patchy reionization\n\nscenarios. The drop in SNR is slower for the MWA relative to the GMRT because the\neffective antenna collecting area of the MWA increases at higher redshifts.\nThe SNR is directly proportional to the global neutral fraction xHI which increases\nwith z. The details of how xHI and the HI fluctuations change with redshift depends on\nhow reionization proceeds with time, an issue beyond the scope of this thesis.\n\n4.5 Summary\nWe have used a visibility-based formalism, introduced in Datta, Bharadwaj & Choudhury\n(2007), to simulate the detection of spherical HII bubbles in redshifted 21 cm maps\nthrough a matched-filtering technique. The main aim of this work is to use simulations\nto quantifying the limitations for bubble detection arising from the HI fluctuations outside the bubble. We have computed the results for two instruments, namely, the GMRT\nand the upcoming MWA. Our main conclusions are as follows:\n\n104\n\n\f4.5 Summary\n\u2022 In the case where the HI fluctuations outside the bubble trace the dark matter\ndistribution (SB scenario), we find that bubbles with radius Rb = 6 Mpc and\n= 12 Mpc or smaller cannot be detected by the GMRT and MWA respectively due\nto the HI fluctuations. Note that this limitation is fundamental to the observations\nand cannot be improved upon by increasing integration time.\n\u2022 For targeted observations of ionized bubbles, the bubble size can be determined to\nan accuracy limited by the instrument's resolution; we find that HI fluctuations\ndo not play any significant role. However, the HI fluctuations can restrict the\naccuracy to which the neutral fraction can be estimated. In addition, we find that\ndetermining the position of the bubble in a blind search could be quite difficult\nfor small (\u223c 10 Mpc) bubbles as the HI fluctuations introduce large fluctuations\nin the signal; for larger bubbles the accuracy is determined by the instrument's\nresolution.\n\u2022 In a scenario of patchy reionization where the targeted HII region is surrounded\nby many small ionized regions of size \u223c 6 Mpc (PR1 scenario), the lower limit for\nbubble detection is similar to that in the SB scenario. Thus the assumption that\nthe HI traces the dark matter gives a reasonable estimate of the contribution from\nHI fluctuations if the background ionized bubbles are small \u223c 6 Mpc. However, the\nsituation is quite different when the surrounding bubbles as of similar size as the\ntargeted bubble (PR2 scenario). The large HI fluctuations do not permit bubble\ndetection for a neutral fraction xHI < 0.6. Thus for xHI = 0.6 or lower, bubble\ndetection is possible only if the other ionized regions in the FoV are much smaller\nthan the bubble that we are trying to detect.\n\u2022 The matched filter technique works well for more realistic cases based on the seminumeric modelling of ionized regions (Choudhury, Haehnelt & Regan, 2008). Here\n\n105\n\n\f4 Simulating Matched Filter Search for Ionized Bubbles\nthe bubbles are substantially non-spherical because of surrounding bubbles and\ninhomogeneous recombination. Our method gives a good estimate of the size of\nboth the fully ionized and the partially ionized regions in the bubble.\nTo put our conclusions in an overall perspective, let us consider an ionized bubble\naround a luminous QSO at z & 6. We expect Rb & 30Mpc from studies of QSO\nabsorption spectra (Wyithe & Loeb 2004; Mesinger & Haiman 2004). It has also been\npointed out that these bubbles may survive as large \"gray fossils\" a long time after\nthe source has shut down (Furlanetto et al. 2008). It will be possible to detect such\nbubbles only if the background bubbles are smaller, say, < 30 Mpc. We find from\nmodels of Mesinger & Furlanetto (2007) that the typical sizes of ionized regions when\nxHI \u223c 0.3(0.1) is \u223c 20(70)Mpc. Though these values could be highly model-dependent,\nit still gives us an idea that the bubbles around the luminous QSO would be detectable\neven in a highly ionized IGM with, say, xHI \u223c 0.3. If the size of the targeted bubble is\nlarger, then this constraint is less severe. This gives a realistic hope of detecting these\nbubbles at z & 6 with near-future facilities.\nA caveat underlying a large part of our analysis is the assumption that the bubbles\nunder consideration are perfectly spherical. This is note the case in reality. For example, non-isotropic emission from the sources (QSOs), density fluctuations in the IGM\nand radiative transfer effects would distort the shape of the bubble. The semi-numeric\nsimulations (SM scenario) incorporate some of these effects and give an estimate of\nthe impact of the deviations from sphericity on bubble detection. This is an important issue which we plan to address in more detail in future. In addition, the finite\nlight travel time gives rise to an apparent non-sphericity even if the physical shape is\nspherical (Wyithe & Loeb, 2004a; Yu, 2005). This effect can, in principle, be estimated\nanalytically and incorporated in the filter. We plan to address this effect in future.\n\n106\n\n\f5 Optimum Redshift for Detecting\nIonized Bubbles\u2217\n\n5.1 Introduction\nIn Chapter 3 we have introduced a matched filter technique to detect individual ionized\nbubbles in 21-cm maps. The technique optimally combines the entire signal from an\nionized bubble while minimizing the noise and foreground. In Chapter 4 we use different\nsimulated 21-cm maps to study the impact of the HI fluctuations outside the bubble\nthat we are trying to detect.\nVarious redshift dependent parameters are important in bubble detection. The background 21-cm brightness and the angular and frequency extent of a bubble of a fixed\ncomoving size increase from higher to lower redshift. The system noise in low frequency\nradio experiments is dominated by the sky temperature which becomes lower at higher\n\u2217\n\nA sharpened, compact version of this chapter is presented in the paper\n\"The optimal redshift for detecting ionized bubbles in HI 21-cm maps\" by\nDatta, Bharadwaj & Choudhury (2009)\n\n107\n\n\f5 Optimum Redshift for Detecting Ionized Bubbles\nfrequency. This makes the noise lower at lower redshifts. All the above mentioned factors are expected to enhance the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at lower redshifts. On the\nother hand, the neutral hydrogen fraction decreases as the reionization process proceed\nand it becomes almost zero around redshift z = 6. We will also see later in the text\nthat the baseline distribution also changes significantly with the frequency band of our\ninterest. This change is also expected to enhance the SNR at higher redshifts. Again, for\nMWA like experiments the increase in effective collecting area of the individual antenna\nis expected to reduce the system noise at higher redshifts. Together these parameters\nwill try to suppress the SNR at lower redshifts with no signal at redshift z = 6 where\nthe Universe is completely reionized. Because of these two oppositely behaving set of\nparameters there is an intermediate redshift where the SNR for a bubble of fixed comoving size peaks. The detection of ionized bubbles is optimal at this redshift. The\nprior knowledge of this optimum redshift is important for any future attempt to detect\nionized bubbles in 21-cm maps.\nIn this Chapter we investigate the optimum redshift to detect ionized bubbles considering different models of the neutral fraction evolution with redshift. Predictions are\nmade for the GMRT and the MWA. We also establish scaling relations for the SNR with\nredshift for a fixed value of bubble size.\nThe Chapter is organized as follows. We begin with a brief description on the 21-cm\nsignal from an ionized bubbles and its redshift dependence Section 5.2. In Section 5.3\nwe present a short note on our matched filtering technique to detect ionized bubbles.\nIn Section 5.4 we establish scaling relations for the SNR with redshift considering both\nuniform-frequency independent and nonuniform-frequency dependent baseline distribution. In the same section we also briefly describe the models of HI evolution that we\nadopt for our calculations. We present our results in Section 5.5 and conclusions in\nSection 5.6\n\n108\n\n\f5.2 Ionized Bubbles in Redshifted 21-cm Observations\nThroughout out this Chapter we adopt cosmological parameters from Dunkley et\nal.(2008). For the GMRT we use the antenna specifications from their website and for\nthe MWA we use the instrumental parameters from Bowman et. al. (2007).\n\n5.2 Ionized Bubbles in Redshifted 21-cm Observations\n~ , \u03bd)\nThe quantity measured in radio-interferometric observations is the visibility V (U\nwhich is measured in a number of frequency channels \u03bd across a frequency bandwidth\nB for every pair of antennas in the array.

We\nhave used A(~\u03b8) described in Chapter 3. The visibility recorded in radio-interferometric\nobservations is a combination of four separate contributions\n~ , \u03bd) = S(U\n~ , \u03bd) + HF (U,\n~ \u03bd) + N(U\n~ , \u03bd) + F (U\n~ , \u03bd)\nV (U\n\n(5.2)\n\n~ , \u03bd) is the HI signal that we are interested in, HF (U,\n~ \u03bd) is contribution from\nwhere S(U\n~ , \u03bd) is the system noise which is inherent\nfluctuating HI outside the target bubble, N(U\n~ \u03bd) is the contribution from other astrophysical sources\nto the measurement and F (U,\nreferred to as the foregrounds.\nWe consider a spherical ionized bubble of comoving radius Rb centered at redshift\nzc at the center of the FoV. This bubble is also assumed to be embedded in an uni-\n\n109\n\n\f5 Optimum Redshift for Detecting Ionized Bubbles\nform inter-galactic medium (IGM) with neutral hydrogen fraction xHI . The planar\nsection through the bubble at a comoving distance r\u03bd is a disk of comoving radius\np\nR\u03bd = Rb 1 \u2212 (\u2206\u03bd/\u2206\u03bdb )2 where \u2206\u03bd = \u03bdc \u2212 \u03bd is the distance from the the bubble center\n\u03bdc in frequency space with \u03bdc = 1420 MHz/(1 + zc ) and \u2206\u03bdb = Rb /r\u03bd\u2032 c is the bubble size\nin the frequency space. The expected observed visibility from this bubble can be written\nas (for details see Chapter 3)\n\u0015 \u0012\n\u0013\n|\n\u03bd\n\u2212\n\u03bd\n|\n2J\n(2\u03c0U\u03b8\n)\nc\n1\n\u03bd\n~ \u03bd) =\n\u0398 1\u2212\n(5.3)\nScenter (U,\n2\u03c0U\u03b8\u03bd\n\u2206\u03bdb\n\u0010 2\u0011\n\u0001\u0010 H \u0011\n\u03a9b h\n0.7\n0\nwhere I \u0304\u03bd = 2.5\u00d7102 Jy\nis the radiation background from the uniform\nsr\n0.02\nh\nH(z)\n\u2212\u03c0 I \u0304\u03bd xHI \u03b8\u03bd2\n\n\u0014\n\nHI distribution. \u03b8\u03bd = R\u03bd /r\u03bd is angular radius of the circular disc through the bubble\n\nat comoving distance r\u03bd .

As a result, in baseline the signal S(U\n\u03bd\nhas the first zero crossing. The signal extends over \u2206\u03bd = \u00b1\u2206\u03bdb in frequency. Note that\nthe angular size \u03b8\u03bd and extent in frequency of a bubbles for a fixed value of comoving\nsize change with redshift because of change in comoving distance r\u03bd and r\u03bd\u2032 . We will\ndiscuss the effect of these change on bubble detection at various redshifts in Section 5.4.\nDetecting these ionized bubbles will be a big challenge because the signal is buried in\nnoise and foregrounds which are both considerably larger in amplitude. Whether we are\nable to detect the ionized bubbles or not depends critically on our ability to construct\noptimal filters which discriminate the signal from other contributions.\n\n110\n\n\f5.3 Matched Filtering Technique to Detect Ionized Bubbles\n\n5.3 Matched Filtering Technique to Detect Ionized\nBubbles\n\nFor optimal signal detection we consider the estimator (Chapter 3)\n\n\u00ca =\n\n\"\nX\na,b\n\n# \"\n#\nX\n~ a , \u03bdb )V\u0302 (U\n~ a , \u03bdb ) /\nSf\u2217 (U\n1\n\n(5.4)\n\na,b\n\n~ , \u03bd) is a filter which has been constructed to detect a particular ionized\nwhere Sf (U\n~ a , \u03bdb ) respectively refer to the observed visibilities and U\n~ a and \u03bdb refer to\nbubble, V\u0302 (U\nthe different baselines and frequency channels in the observation and in eq.

In this Section we present a scaling relations for the estimator\ndescribing its change with redshift. We assume a bubble of fixed size at the center of\nthe FoV and the filter is exactly matched with bubble. In a situation where the baseline\n~ , \u03bd)) is (i) uniform in baseline over the signal S(U\n~ , \u03bd) (ii) independent\ndistribution (\u03c1(U\nof frequency channels and (iii) the frequency bandwidth is much larger than the bubble\n\n112\n\n\f5.4 Redshift Dependence: Scaling Relations\n(BW >> \u2206\u03bdb ) the estimator scales exactly as\nh\u00cai(z) \u221d x2HI (z)I \u0304\u03bd2 \u03b8\u03bd2c \u2206\u03bdb\n\n(5.9)\n\nwhere xHI (z) quantifies the evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction. The redshifted\n21-cm background I \u0304\u03bd scales as (1+z)\u22121.5 at higher redshifts. The angular size \u03b8\u03bdc which is\n\u221d 1/r\u03bd approximately scales as (1 + z)\u22120.25 for a fixed value of bubble size. Similarly the\nfrequency extent of the bubble (2 \u2206\u03bdb ) decreases with redshift as (1+z)\u22120.5. Considering\nall these quantities we get\nh\u00cai(z) \u221d x2HI (z)(1 + z)\u22124 .\n\n(5.10)\n\nThe system noise is dominated by the sky temperature Tsky for the frequency range\nof interest. The sky temperature Tsky increases with observed wavelength and scales\nas (1 + z)\u03b2 , where \u03b2 is the spectral index. Considering this fact and under the same\nassumptions mentioned above the noise variance can be written as\nh(\u2206\u00ca)2 iNS (z) \u221d x2HI (z)(1 + z)2 \u03b2\u22124 .\n\n(5.11)\n\nIn this equation we have assumed that the individual antenna collecting area is independent of frequency (applicable to the GMRT). For MWA like antenna the individual\nantenna collecting area is expected to increase with observed wavelength as \u223c \u03bb2 and\nthe noise variance scales as\nh(\u2206\u00ca)2 iNS (z) \u221d (1 + z)2 \u03b2\u22128 .\n\n(5.12)\n\nThe fluctuating HI outside the ionized bubble also contribute to the variance of the\nestimator. This contribution can not be reduced by increasing observation time and put\n\n113\n\n\f5 Optimum Redshift for Detecting Ionized Bubbles\nfundamental restrictions in detecting ionized bubbles. The HI distribution outside the\ntarget bubble during reionizaintion is highly unknown and differs drastically for different\nmodels of reionizations. For simplicity we assume that the HI outside the bubble trace\nthe dark matter distribution. The presence of other ionized regions outside the bubble\nare expected to increase this contribution. The assumption that the HI outside the\nbubble trace the dark matter distribution will give the minimum variance contribution\nto the estimator. Analytical derivation of the scaling relation for the h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iHF is not\nstraight forward because of the term C2\u03c0U (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 ). Assuming that the HI to trace the\ndark matter we numerically calculate h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iHF at various redshifts using equation 5.8.\nWe then fit the data with a power law of (1 + z) which comes out to be\n\nh(\u2206\u00ca)2 iHF \u221d x2HI (z)(1 + z)\u221210.5 .\n\n(5.13)\n\nDetection of bubble is possible when h\u00cai(z) > h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iHF. When this is satisfied we are\nq\ninterested only in h\u00cai/ h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iNS which we call SNR. Note that the term xHI (z) in the\nequations 5.9, 5.11 is almost constant along the line of sight of the ionized bubble. This\nfactor does not affect the value of the quantity SNR. One can drop xHI (z) and similarly\n~ , \u03bd) without losing the effectiveness of the method. We calculate\nI \u0304\u03bd from the filter Sf (U\nthe SNR at different redshifts ranging from z = 6 to 16 for a fixed value of bubble size.\nUsing equations 5.10 and 5.11 for a GMRT like antenna we have\n\nSNR \u221d xHI (z)(1 + z)\u2212\u03b2\u22122\n\n(5.14)\n\nFor a MWA like antenna this is\nSNR \u221d xHI (z)(1 + z)\u2212\u03b2\n\n114\n\n(5.15)\n\n\f5.4 Redshift Dependence: Scaling Relations\nNote that in the above two equations xHI (z) is a increasing function of redshift z and\nfor a typical value of \u03b2 \u2248 2.5 \u2212 2.8, we expect the SNR to be peaked at an intermediate\nredshift during reionization. As we discussed earlier this is due to three reasons, firstly\nthe sky temperature increases at low frequency ie, at higher redshifts. Second the background specific intensity I \u0304\u03bd also decreases at higher redshift. Finally the angular size\nand frequency extent of the bubble also become smaller at higher redshift due to the\nincrease in r\u03bd and r\u03bd\u2032 with redshift . We see that the two factors are opposite in natureone increases with redshift whereas the other decrease. There is an intermediate redshift\nz where the SNR is maximum.\n\n5.4.2 Non uniform and frequency dependent baseline distribution\n~ (see figure 3.5 in Chapter 3)\nThe baseline distribution in general is not uniform in U\nand also frequency dependent. This non uniformity changes the above scaling relations.\nWe introduce a parameter n to take into account this effect and now modified SNR can\nbe written as\n\nSNR \u221d xHI (z)(1 + z)n/2\u2212\u03b2\u22122\n\n(5.16)\n\nfor the GMRT like antenna. For MWA like antenna this is\n\nSNR \u221d xHI (z)(1 + z)n/2\u2212\u03b2\n\n(5.17)\n\n~ \u03bd) is frequency dependent and the\nThe normalized baseline distribution function \u03c1N (U,\nparameter n takes care of that. Note that n = 0 is situation for uniform baseline\ncoverage. The value of n depends on the bubble size. For large bubbles the signal\nremains confined within small baselines whereas for smaller bubbles a significant amount\n\n115\n\n\f5 Optimum Redshift for Detecting Ionized Bubbles\nof signal spreads to larger baselines. Thus the normalized baseline distribution function\n~ , \u03bd) acts in different manner on bubbles of different sizes. For a situation when the\n\u03c1N (U\n~ , \u03bd) is constant in U\n~ over the signal we have n = 2. In a situation where the signal\n\u03c1N (U\n~ over the whole baseline range \u03c1N (U\n~ , \u03bd) does not play significant role\nis constant in U\nand n = 0. In general we have 0 < n < 2. We will discuss more about the exact values\nof n for the GMRT and the MWA later.\nThe GMRT baseline distribution is well described by the sum of a Gaussian (at small\n~ , \u03bd)\nbaselines) and an exponential (at large baseline)(Figure 3.5 in Chapter 3). Here \u03c1N (U\n~ = 100 for the frequency range of interest and\nremains almost constant up to a baseline U\nthen it decays. For the larger bubbles of radius Rb \u2265 50Mpc, the signal is confined with\n~ = 100 and we have n = 2 for which SNR \u221d xHI (z)(1 + z)\u22123.6\na maximum baseline of U\nwhere we assume \u03b2 = 2.6. For smaller bubbles the signal extends to larger baselines\n~ , \u03bd) decays with U\n~ and the n value also\nwhere the baseline distribution function \u03c1N (U\nbecomes smaller. For example, for the bubbles of sizes Rb = 30, 20 and 10Mpc the\nvalues of n are 1.27, 1.07 and 0.5 respectively. We have assumed that the MWA antenna\ndistribution is \u03c1ant \u223c r \u22122 , where r is physical distance from the center of the array. Here\n~ , \u03bd) also decays monotonically. For the bubble sizes Rb = 50, 30, 20 and 10 Mpc the\n\u03c1N (U\nvalues of n are 0.45, 0.18 and 0 respectively.\nThe behavior of the HI fluctuations contribution also changes with redshift when\nwe calculate for non-uniform and frequency dependent baseline distribution. As we go\nto higher redshifts the HI fluctuations decreases but slowly than uniform baseline case.\nThis is due to the same reason as discussed in the 1st paragraph of this subsection. Using\nequation 5.8 we calculate h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iHF numerically at different redshifts for the bubble sizes\nq\nRb = 10, 20, 30 and 50 Mpc. For the GMRT we find that h(\u2206\u00ca)2 iHF \u223c xHI (z)(1 +\n\nz)\u22123.67 , xHI (z)(1 + z)\u22123.37 , xHI (z)(1 + z)\u22123.25 and xHI (z)(1 + z)\u22123.16 respectively. For the\n\nMWA these are xHI (z)(1+z)\u22124.26 , xHI (z)(1+z)\u22124.18 , xHI (z)(1+z)\u22124 and xHI (z)(1+z)\u22123.85\n\n116\n\n\f5.4 Redshift Dependence: Scaling Relations\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n\nModel II\n\nx HI (z)\n\n0.7\n\nModel I\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nz\nFigure 5.1: This shows the evolution of the mean neutral fraction xHI with redshift for\nthe two different reionization models discussed in the text.\nrespectively.\n\n5.4.3 Evolution of neutral fraction with redshift\nIn this work, we consider two physically motivated models of reionization, namely, the\nearly reionization model and the late reionization model which we call Model I and\nModel II respectively. These models are constructed using the semi-analytical formalism\n(Choudhury & Ferrara, 2005; Choudhury & Ferrara, 2006a) which implements most of\nthe relevant physics governing the thermal and ionization history of the IGM, such as\nthe inhomogeneous IGM density distribution, three different classes of ionizing photon\nsources (massive PopIII stars, PopII stars and QSOs), radiative feedback inhibiting\nstar formation in low-mass galaxies and chemical feedback for transition from PopIII\nto PopII stars. The models are consistent with various observational data, namely, the\nredshift evolution of Lyman-limit absorption systems, the Gunn-Peterson effect, electron\n\n117\n\n\f5 Optimum Redshift for Detecting Ionized Bubbles\nscattering optical depths, temperature of the IGM and cosmic star formation history.\nIn Model I, hydrogen reionization starts around z \u2248 16 driven by metal-free (PopIII)\nstars, and it is 50% complete by z \u2248 10. The contribution of PopIII stars decrease below\nthis redshift because of the combined action of radiative and chemical feedback. As a\nresult, reionization is extended considerably completing only at z \u2248 6 (Figure 5.1).\nIn Model II, the contribution from the metal-free stars is ignored, which makes reionization start much later and is only 50 per cent complete only around z \u2248 7.5. The main\ndifference between this model with the previous one is in their predictions for the electron\nscattering optical depth (which is 0.15 for the early reionization model and 0.06 for the\nlate reionization model). Recent measurements of the electron scattering optical depth\n\u03c4e = 0.087 \u00b1 0.017 (Dunkley et al. 2008) suggests that these two models are possibly at\ntwo extreme ends of different possible reionization scenarios.\n\n5.5 Optimum Redshift to Detect Ionized Bubbles\nWe consider bubbles of comoving size ranging from 2 Mpc to 50 Mpc at redshifts from\nz = 6 to 16. Figure 5.2 shows the SNR contours for 1000 hrs of observations with\nthe GMRT. The left panel shows results for a constant neutral fraction xHI = 1. This\nshows the joint effect of factors such as the background 21-cm brightness I \u0304\u03bd , angular\nand frequency extent of the bubble, sky temperature, normalized baseline distribution\nfunction and the effective area of individual antenna. We see that the SNR is maximum\nat redshift the z = 6 for any bubble size. As we have discussed in Section 5.4 (equations\n5.16 and 5.17) this is because of the lower noise at lower redshift. The region to the left\nof a line is allowed for the detection. For example a 5 \u03c3 detection is possible for a bubble\nsize Rb > 16 Mpc at redshift z = 6. At z \u2265 11 a 5 \u03c3 is not possible even for bubbles of\nsize 50 Mpc. The middle shows the same results for Model I. We see that the redshift\n\n118\n\n\f5.5 Optimum Redshift to Detect Ionized Bubbles\n\nFigure 5.2: This shows the SNR contours for 1000 hrs observations with the GMRT. The\nleft panel shows results for a constant neutral fraction xHI = 1. Middle and\nright panel show results for the Model I and the Model II respectively. The\nHI fluctuations dominate over the signal in the shaded region and bubble\ndetection is not possible.\n\nFigure 5.3: Same as the figure 5.2 for the MWA.\nrange z \u223c 9 to 10 where the SNR is maximum is the optimum redshift range for bubble\ndetection. We also see that a 3 \u03c3 detection is possible for bubbles of size \u2265 46 Mpc at\nthe optimum redshift. A 3 \u03c3 detection is also possible for a bubble size Rb \u2265 50 Mpc\nin the redshift range z \u223c 7 to 11 . Results for the Model II are presented in the right\npanel. Here we see that redshift z = 8 is optimum for bubble detection. In this model\nthe reionization occurred at lower redshift and hence the SNR is comparatively higher.\nBubble detection is relatively easier in Model II. For example a 5\u03c3 detection is possible\nfor Rb \u2265 38 Mpc at z = 8 which is not possible in the Model I. In all the panels bubble\ndetection is not possible on the shaded region due to the HI fluctuations.\nFigure 5.3 shows the same results for the MWA. The effective collecting area of the\nindividual MWA antenna is expected to increase with wavelength i.e, with redshift as\n\n119\n\n\f5 Optimum Redshift for Detecting Ionized Bubbles\n\nFigure 5.4: This shows the SNR contours for a fixed value of bubble size with the GMRT.\nLeft panel shows results for a Rb = 20 Mpc bubble and 4000 hrs of observations. Right panel shows results for Rb = 50 Mpc bubble size and 1000 hrs\nof observations\n\u223c (1 + z)2 . This will reduce the noise rms at higher redshifts and make bubble detection\neasier at higher redshifts than the GMRT. For example a 5\u03c3 detection is possible in\nModel I for bubble Rb = 50 Mpc in the redshift range z = 9 to 15 which seems impossible\nwith the GMRT. The SNR is 3 times higher than the GMRT at redshift z = 16 for a\nRb = 46 Mpc bubble. The optimum redshift in Model I for the MWA is z \u223c 11 which is\nslightly higher than the GMRT. Detection of bubbles in model II is more optimistic in\nthe MWA where 5\u03c3 is possible for bubbles of Rb \u2265 38 Mpc at redshift z \u223c 8.5 which is\nthe optimum redshift of detection in this model.\nIn the above discussion we consider different models of the mean HI evolution. The\nHI evolution surrounding the ionized bubbles is highly unknown and model dependent.\nKeeping this in mind we consider a bubble of a fixed size and calculate the SNR for\nneutral fraction xHI = 0 to 1 at various redshift ranging from z = 6 to 16. We present\nresults in Figures 5.4 and 5.5 for the GMRT and the MWA respectively for bubble size\nRb = 20 Mpc (left panel) and 50 Mpc (right panel). The left panel in the figure 5.4\nshows results for 4000 hrs of observation. The Figure demonstrates the detectibility of\n\n120\n\n\f5.6 Conclusions\n\nFigure 5.5: Same as the figure 5.4 for the MWA.\na Rb = 20(50) Mpc bubble embedded in the HI of some neutral fraction. We see that a\nhigher neutral fraction is required to detect bubbles at higher redshifts. For example we\nsee that a 3\u03c3 detection for a bubble Rb = 50 Mpc is possible for neutral fraction \u223c 0.1\nat redshift z = 6 with the GMRT (Figure 5.4) but the neutral fraction \u223c 1 is required\nat z = 12 to detect the same bubble. Bubble detection is found to be easier at higher\nredshifts for the MWA.\n\n5.6 Conclusions\nWe investigate the optimum redshift for bubble detection. We find that for early reionization the redshift z = 9 and 11 are respectively the optimum redshifts for the GMRT\nand the MWA. For late reionization redshift z = 8 is found to be the optimum redshift\nfor both the experiments. Bubble detection will be easier if the reionization occurred\nlate. This is because of less noise and higher 21-cm background intensity. The MWA is\nsuitable for bubble detection at higher redshifts (z > 8.5) than the GMRT. We also find\nthat at redshift z = 6 if surrounding mean neutral fraction is xHI \u2265 0.1 a bubble of size\nRb > 50 Mpc is possible to detect with 1000 hrs of observation for both the experiments.\n\n121\n\n\f5 Optimum Redshift for Detecting Ionized Bubbles\n\n122\n\n\fReferences\n\nAli, S.

The first step would be to calculate the spherical harmonic component alm of the brightness temperature T (\u03bd, n\u0302). Using the expression (2.6) for \u03b7\u0303HI (k) in\nequation (2.10), the expression for alm can be written as\nd3 k\nalm (\u03bd) = T\u0304 x\u0304HI d\u03a9\n(2\u03c0)3\nh\ni\n\u00d7 \u2206HI (k) + (n\u0302 * k\u0302)2 \u2206(k) e\u2212ikr\u03bd (k\u0302*n\u0302)\nZ\n\n\u2217\nYlm\n(n\u0302)\n\nZ\n\n(A1)\n\nR\n\u2217\nwhich then essentially involves solving angular integrals of the forms d\u03a9 Ylm\ne\u2212ikr\u03bd (k\u0302*n\u0302)\nR\n\u2217\nand d\u03a9 Ylm\n(n\u0302 * k\u0302)2 e\u2212ikr\u03bd (k\u0302*n\u0302) respectively. Expanding the term e\u2212ikr\u03bd (k\u0302*n\u0302) in terms of\nspherical Bessel functions jl (kr\u03bd ), one can show that\nZ\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\nd\u03a9 Ylm\n(n\u0302) e\u2212ikr\u03bd (k\u0302*n\u0302) = 4\u03c0(\u2212i)l jl (kr\u03bd )Ylm\n(k\u0302)\n\n(A2)\n\nDifferentiating the above equation with respect to kr\u03bd twice\nZ\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\nd\u03a9 (k\u0302 * n\u0302)2 Ylm\n(n\u0302) e\u2212ikr\u03bd (k\u0302*n\u0302) = \u22124\u03c0(\u2212i)l jl\u2032\u2032 (kr\u03bd )Ylm\n(k\u0302)\n\n(A3)\n\nwhere jl\u2032\u2032 (x) is the second derivative of jl (x) with respect to its argument, and can be\nobtained through the recursion relation\n\n(2l +\n\n\u0015\n\u0014 2\nl\n(l + 1)2\n\u2212 1)\njl (x)\njl\u22122 (x) \u2212\n+\n2l \u2212 1\n2l \u2212 1\n2l + 3\n\nl(l\n1)jl\u2032\u2032 (x)=\n\n\f5 Appendix\n\n+\n\n(l + 1)(l + 2)\njl+2 (x)\n2l + 3\n\n(A4)\n\nSo the final expression of alm is given by\n\nalm (\u03bd) = 4\u03c0 T\u0304 x\u0304HI (\u2212i)\n\nl\n\nZ\n\nd3 k \u2217\nY (k\u0302)\n(2\u03c0)3 lm\n\n\u00d7 [\u2206HI (k)jl (kr\u03bd ) \u2212 \u2206(k)jl\u2032\u2032 (kr\u03bd )]\n\n(A5)\n\nThe next step is to calculate the the power spectrum Cl (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 ) \u2261 halm (\u03bd1 ) a\u2217lm (\u03bd2 )i.\nThe corresponding expression is then given by\nCl (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 )=(4\u03c0)2 T\u0304 (z1 )T\u0304 (z2 ) x\u0304HI (z1 )x\u0304HI (z2 )\nZ 3 Z 3\nd k2 \u2217\nd k1\nY (k\u03021 )Ylm (k\u03022 )\n\u00d7\n3\n(2\u03c0)\n(2\u03c0)3 lm\n\n\u00d7h[\u2206HI (z1 , k1 )jl (k1 r\u03bd1 ) \u2212 \u2206(z1 , k1 )jl\u2032\u2032 (k1 r\u03bd1 )]\n\n\u00d7 [\u2206\u2217HI (z2 , k2 )jl (k2 r\u03bd2 ) \u2212 \u2206\u2217 (z2 , k2 )jl\u2032\u2032 (k2 r\u03bd2 )]i\n(A6)\n\nwhere we have put back the redshift-dependence into the expressions for clarity. Now\nnote that we would mostly be interested in cases where \u03bd2 \u2212 \u03bd1 \u2261 \u2206\u03bd \u226a \u03bd1 . In such\ncases, one can safely assume T\u0304 (z2 ) \u2248 T\u0304 (z1 ) and x\u0304HI (z2 ) \u2248 x\u0304HI (z1 ). Furthermore,\nthe terms involving the ensemble averages of the form h\u2206\u2206\u2217 i can be approximated\nas h\u2206(z1 , k1 )\u2206\u2217 (z2 , k2 )i \u2248 (2\u03c0)3 \u03b4D (k1 \u2212 k2 )P (z1 , k1 ) and similarly for terms involving\n\u2206HI . We can then use the Dirac delta function \u03b4D (k1 \u2212 k2 ) to compute the k2 -integral,\nand thus can write the angular power spectrum as\n\nCl (\u2206\u03bd)\u2261Cl (\u03bd, \u03bd + \u2206\u03bd)\n\n134\n\n\fB Correspondence between all-sky and flat-sky power spectra\nd3 k1 \u2217\nY (k\u0302)Ylm (k\u0302)\n=(4\u03c0) T\u0304\n(2\u03c0)3 lm\nh\n\u00d7 jl (kr\u03bd )jl (kr\u03bd2 )P\u22062HI (k)\n2\n\n2\n\nx\u03042HI\n\nZ\n\n\u2212{jl (kr\u03bd )jl\u2032\u2032 (kr\u03bd2 ) + jl (kr\u03bd2 )jl\u2032\u2032 (kr\u03bd )}P\u2206HI (k)\n+ jl\u2032\u2032 (kr\u03bd )jl\u2032\u2032 (kr\u03bd2 )P (k)]\n\nUsing the normalization property of the spherical harmonics\n\n(A7)\n\nR\n\ndn\u0302|Ylm (n\u0302)|2 = 1, one can\n\ncarry out the angular integrals in the above expression, and hence obtain the final result\n(2.11) as quoted in the main text.\n\nB Correspondence between all-sky and flat-sky power\nspectra\nAs discussed in section 2.2.3, we shall mostly be interested in very small angular scales,\nwhich corresponds to l \u226b 1. For high values of l, it is most useful to work in the flat-sky\napproximation, where a small portion of the sky can be approximated by a plane. Then\nthe unit vector n\u0302 towards the direction of observation can be decomposed into n\u0302 = m+\u03b8,\nwhere m is a vector towards the center of the field of view and \u03b8 is a two-dimensional\nvector in the plane of the sky.\nWithout loss of generality, let us now consider a small region around the pole \u03b8 \u2192\n0. In that case the vector \u03b8 can be treated as a Cartesian vector with components\n{\u03b8 cos \u03c6, \u03b8 sin \u03c6}. This holds true for any two-dimensional vector on the sky, in particular\nU = {U cos \u03c6U , U sin \u03c6U }. Then the spherical harmonic components of T (\u03bd, n\u0302) [defined\nin equation (2.10)] can be written as\n\nalm (\u03bd) \u2248\n\nZ\n\n\u2217\nd\u03b8 Ylm\n(\u03b8, \u03c6) T (\u03bd, n\u0302)\n\n(B1)\n\n135\n\n\f5 Appendix\nwhere we have replaced\n\nR\n\nd\u03a9 \u2192\n\nR\n\nd\u03b8.
