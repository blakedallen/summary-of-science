One might roughly\ndivide such applications into the analysis of data which is sampled in time\nor in space. Applications involving spatially sampled data are basic in numerical analysis, since constant coefficient partial differential equations and\nsome of their discrete analogs, including the heat, wave, Schrodinger, and\nbeam equations in one space dimension, have exact solutions in Fourier series. Other applications of the DFT involving the analysis of spatially sampled data include noise removal, data compression, data interpolation, and\napproximation of functions. These applications often take advantage of the\ntight and explicit linkage binding the harmonic analysis of uniformly sampled\ndata with the harmonic analysis of periodic functions defined on R.\nMany aspects of Fourier analysis can be developed through the spectral theory of the second derivative operator \u2212D 2 = \u2212d2 /dx2 acting on the\nHilbert space of square integrable functions with period 1. An orthogonal\nbasis of eigenfunctions is given by exp(2\u03c0ikx). If N uniformly spaced samples xn = n/N for n = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1 are considered, the restriction of the\nexponential functions to the sample points\nexp(2\u03c0ikn/N),\n\nk, n = 0, . . . , N \u2212 1,\n\nagain provides an orthogonal basis for functions on the set {xn }. These\nsampled exponential functions are also eigenfunctions for 'local' operators\nsuch as \u2206N , which acts by\n1\n\u2206N f (xn ) = f (xn ) \u2212 [f (xn\u22121 + f (xn+1 )],\n2\nindex arithmetic being carried out modulo N. The fact that efficient FFT\nalgorithms are available for sampled data is not a consequence of abstract\nspectral theory, but relies on the exponential form of the eigenfunctions and\nthe arithmetic progression of the frequencies k.\nOur discussion now shifts to graphs and their refinements, with the circle\nand its uniform sampling serving as an example. Discrete graphs with NV <\n\u221e vertices and NE edges have a well developed spectral theory [7] based on\nthe adjacency or Laplace operators acting on functions defined on the vertex\nset V. While these ideas play a role here, the lead actor is a continuous graph,\n2\n\n\falso known as a metric graph or, when a differential operator is emphasized,\na quantum graph. Here the edges of a graph are identified with intervals\n[an , bn ] \u2282 R, functions are elements of the Hilbert space \u2295n L2 [an , bn ], and\ndifferential operators such as \u2212D 2 provide a basis for both physical modeling\nand harmonic analysis. (The terminology for such 'continuous graphs' is not\nsettled, with the terms topological graphs or networks also used.)\nThe natural and technological worlds offer numerous opportunities for\ngraph modeling, where applications such as those mentioned above can be\nconsidered with data sampled from continuous graphs. These include the\nsampling of populations along river systems, and the description of traffic density on road networks. Biological systems transport nutrients, waste,\nheat, and pressure waves through vascular networks, and electrochemical signals through natural neural networks. Elaborate networks are manufactured\nin microelectronics, and for microfluidic laboratories on chips.\nDespite a rapidly growing literature on 'quantum graphs' [4, 8, 9], and\nsome work [2] generalizing the classical theory of Fourier series to functions\ndefined on a continuous graph, there is a very limited literature considering\nthe harmonic analysis of sampled data for these geometric objects. The\npapers [13, 14] consider sampling on continuous graphs with virtually no\nlength restrictions on the edges. In contrast, this work exploits the features\nappearing when graphs have equal length edges, and obtains the following\nconclusion: every finite continuous graph with edges of equal length admits a\nfamily of DFTs closely analogous to that of the circle, and an FFT algorithm\nfor their efficient computation.\nTo unify the presentation a bit, we focus on simple discrete graphs, without loops or multiple edges between vertices, whose vertices have degree at\nleast two. Given a continuous version of a nonsimple graph without boundary vertices, one can insert additional vertices of degree 2 to reduce to the\nsimple case. This insertion of 'invisible' vertices can also be used to reduce\ngraphs whose edge lengths are integer multiples of a common value to the\nequal length case. Algorithmically, this reduction increases the size of the\ndiscrete graph spectral problem whose solution is an important component\nof the DFT.\nThere are four subsequent sections in the paper. The second section starts\nwith a review of differential operators on continuous graphs. This leads to\na more detailed discussion of the spectral theory of the standard Laplace\ndifferential operator on continuous graphs with equal length edges. Most of\nthe material in this section was previously known [3, 11], although Theorem\n3\n\n\f2.9 appears to be new. The third section explores the linked spectral theory\nof Laplacians for continuous graphs and their uniformly sampled subgraphs.\nThe fourth section shows that efficient algorithms for Fourier analysis are\navailable. The final section presents a simple example where many of the\ncomputations can be done 'by hand'.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nSpectra of continuous graph Laplacians\nContinuous graphs and the standard Laplacian\n\nIn this work a discrete graph G will be finite and simple, with a vertexset V\nhaving NV points, and a set E of NE edges. Each edge e has a positive length\nle . It is convenient to number the edges. For n = 1, . . . , NE the edge en is\nidentified with a real interval [an , bn ] of length ln . The resulting topological\ngraph is also denoted G. In an obvious fashion one may extend the standard\nmetric and Lebesgue measure from the edges to G.\nThe identification of graph edges and intervals allows us to define the\nHilbert space\n2\nE\nL2 (G) = \u2295N\nn=1 L [an , bn ]\nwith the inner product\nZ\nXZ\nhf, gi = f g =\nG\n\nn\n\nbn\n\nfn (x)gn (x) dx,\n\nan\n\nfn : [an , bn ] \u2192 C.\n\nWe will employ the standard vertex conditions, requiring continuity at the\nvertices,\nlim f (x) = lim f (x), e(i), e(j) \u223c v,\n(2.1)\nx\u2208e(i)\u2192v\n\nx\u2208e(j)\u2192v\n\nand the derivative condition\nX\n\n\u2202\u03bd fn (v) = 0.\n\n(2.2)\n\nen \u223cv\n\nHere the derivative \u2202\u03bd fn (v) is fn\u2032 (an ), respectively \u2212fn\u2032 (bn ) if an , respectively\nbn , is identified with v.\nThe standard vertex conditions are used to define the Laplacian Lf =\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2212f of the continuous graph G. Let Dmax denote the set of functions f \u2208\nL2 (G) with f \u2032 absolutely continuous on each en , and f \u2032\u2032 \u2208 L2 (G). The domain\n4\n\n\fD of L is then the set of f \u2208 Dmax satisfying the standard conditions (2.1)\nand (2.2). From the classical theory of ordinary differential operators [12, p.\nS123] one knows that L is self adjoint with compact resolvent. This operator\nis nonnegative, with 0 being a simple eigenvalue if G is connected. Writing\neigenvalues with multiplicity, the spectrum is thus a sequence 0 = \u03bb0 < \u03bb1 \u2264\n\u03bb2 \u2264 . . . , and there is a orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions.\nWe now impose the additional requirement that all edges of G have equal\nlength. In this situation the operator L will be denoted \u2206\u221e . Initially the\nedge lengths are taken to be 1, but the rescaling \u03be = x/L converts the system\nDx2 Y = \u03bbY to\nD\u03be2 Y = \u03bcY, 0 \u2264 \u03be \u2264 1, \u03bc = L2 \u03bb.\n(2.3)\n\nValues of eigenfunctions at graph vertices are not effected, and derivatives\nare scaled by L. Thus eigenfunctions with eigenvalue \u03bb for the standard\nLaplacian on the graph with edge lengths L are taken to eigenfunctions with\neigenvalue L2 \u03bb for the standard Laplacian on the graph with edge lengths 1.\nThe spectrum of \u2206\u221e is tightly linked to the discrete graph G and the\nspectrum of the discrete Laplacian of combinatorial graph theory. Let E(\u03bb)\ndenote the eigenspace of \u2206\u221e for the eigenvalue \u03bb. The connections between\nE(\u03bb) and the discrete graph G arise in two ways, depending on whether or\nnot \u03bb \u2208 {n2 \u03c0 2 | n = 1, 2, 3, . . . }. Before exploring this dichotomy, we note\nthe following result.\nProposition 2.1. If \u03c9 > 0,\ndim E(\u03c9 2 ) = dim E([\u03c9 + 2n\u03c0]2 ),\n\nn = 1, 2, 3, . . . .\n\nProof. Suppose n \u2265 1 and Y is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue \u03c9 2. On each\nedge\ny(x) = A cos(\u03c9x) + B sin(\u03c9x).\nThe function\ny1 (x) = A cos([\u03c9 + 2n\u03c0]x) + B sin([\u03c9 + 2n\u03c0]x)\nthen satisfies the equation,\n\u2212y1\u2032\u2032 = [\u03c9 + 2n\u03c0]2 y1 ,\nand at the endpoints of the edge we have\ny(0) = y1 (0),\n\ny(1) = y1 (1).\n5\n\n\fThe endpoint derivatives are\ny \u2032(0) = \u03c9B,\n\ny \u2032(1) = \u03c9[B cos(\u03c9) \u2212 A sin(\u03c9)]\n\nand\ny1\u2032 (0) = [\u03c9 + 2n\u03c0]B,\n\ny1\u2032 (1) = [\u03c9 + 2n\u03c0][B cos(\u03c9) \u2212 A sin(\u03c9)],\n\nso\n\n\u03c9 + 2n\u03c0 \u2032\n\u03c9 + 2n\u03c0 \u2032\ny (0), y1\u2032 (1) =\ny (1).\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\nThus y1 satisfies the same interior vertex conditions that y does. Moreover, the linear map taking y \u2192 y1 is one-to-one, as is the analogous map\nfrom E([\u03c9 + 2n\u03c0]2 ) to E(\u03c9 2 ).\ny1\u2032 (0) =\n\n2.2\n\nRole of the discrete Laplacian\n\nGiven a vertex v \u2208 G, let u1 , . . . , udeg(v) be the vertices adjacent to v. A\ndiscrete graph carries a number of linear operators acting on the vertex space\nH of functions f : V \u2192 C, including the adjacency operator\ndeg(v)\n\nAf (v) =\n\nX\n\nf (ui ),\n\ni=1\n\nand the degree operator\nT f (v) = deg(v)f (v).\nDefine the operator \u22061 by\n\u22061 f (v) = f (v) \u2212 T \u22121 Af (v).\n\u22061 is similar to the much studied Laplacian [7, p. 3],\nI \u2212 T \u22121/2 AT \u22121/2 .\nThe distinction of the cases \u03bb \u2208 {n2 \u03c0 2 } is related to the following fact.\nLemma 2.2. Fix \u03bb \u2208 C, and consider the vector space of solutions of \u2212y \u2032\u2032 =\n\u03bby on the interval [0, 1]. The linear function taking y(x) to (y(0), y(1)) is an\nisomorphism if and only if \u03bb \u2208\n/ {n2 \u03c0 2 | n = 1, 2, 3, . . . }.\n6\n\n\fProof. For \u03bb \u2208\n/ {n2 \u03c0 2 }, the formula\ny(x, \u03bb) = y(0) cos(\u03c9x) + [y(1) \u2212 y(0) cos(\u03c9)]\n\nsin(\u03c9x)\nsin(\u03c9)\n\n(2.4)\n\nshows that the map is surjective. On the other hand, if \u03bb \u2208 {n2 \u03c0 2 }, then\ny(0) = 0 implies y(1) = 0, since y(x) = B sin(n\u03c0x).\nAs an immediate consequence we have the following result for graphs.\nLemma 2.3. Suppose the edges of G have length 1, and \u03bb \u2208\n/ {n2 \u03c0 2 | n =\n1, 2, 3, . . . }. Let y : G \u2192 C be continuous, and satisfy \u2212y \u2032\u2032 = \u03bby on the edges.\nIf y(v) = 0 at all vertices of G, then y(x) = 0 for all x \u2208 G.\nTheorem 2.4. Suppose \u03bb \u2208\n/ {n2 \u03c0 2 | n = 1, 2, 3, . . . } and y is an eigenfunction for \u2206\u221e . If v has adjacent vertices u1 , . . . , udeg(v) , then\ndeg(v)\nX\n1\ny(ui ).\ncos(\u03c9)y(v) =\ndeg(v) i=1\n\n(2.5)\n\nProof. In local coordinates identifying each ui with 0, (2.4) for yi on the\nedges ei = (ui , v) gives\nyi\u2032 (v) = \u2212\u03c9 sin(\u03c9)yi (ui ) + [yi (v) \u2212 yi (ui ) cos(\u03c9)]\n\n\u03c9 cos(\u03c9)\n.\nsin(\u03c9)\n\n(2.6)\n\nSumming over i, the derivative condition at v then gives\n0=\n\nX\ni\n\nyi\u2032 (v) = \u2212\u03c9 sin(\u03c9)\n\nX\n\nyi (ui ) +\n\ni\n\n\u03c9 cos(\u03c9) X\n[yi (v) \u2212 yi (ui ) cos(\u03c9)].\nsin(\u03c9) i\n\nUsing the continuity of y at v and elementary manipulations gives (2.5).\n(2.5) is clearly an eigenvalue equation, with eigenvalue cos(\u03c9), for the linear\noperator T \u22121 A acting on the space of (real or complex valued) functions on\nthe vertex set. With this background established, we are ready to relate the\nspectra of \u22061 and \u2206\u221e .\nTheorem 2.5. If \u03bb \u2208\n/ {n2 \u03c0 2 | n = 0, 1,\n\u221a2, . . . }, then \u03bb is an eigenvalue of\n\u2206\u221e if and only if 1 \u2212 cos(\u03c9) = 1 \u2212 cos( \u03bb) is an eigenvalue of \u22061 , with the\nsame geometric multiplicity.\n7\n\n\fProof. Since \u22061 = I \u2212 T \u22121 A, we may work with T \u22121 A. Suppose first that\ny(x, \u03bb) is an eigenfunction of \u2206\u221e satisfying the given vertex conditions. Theorem 2.4 shows that the (linear) evaluation map taking y : G \u2192 C to\ny : V \u2192 C takes eigenfunctions to solutions of (2.5). By Lemma 2.3 the\nkernel of this map is the zero function, so the map is injective.\nSuppose conversely that y : V \u2192 C satisfies\nT \u22121 Ay(v) = \u03bcy(v),\n\n|\u03bc| < 1.\n\nPick \u03bb \u2208 cos\u22121 (\u03bc). By Lemma 2.2 the function y : V \u2192 C extends to a\nunique continuous function y(x, \u03bb) : G \u2192 C satisfying \u2212y \u2032\u2032 = \u03bby on each\nedge.\nIn local coordinates identifying v with 0 for each edge ei = (v, ui ) incident\non v, this extended function satisfies (2.6). Summing gives\nX\nX\nX\n\u03c9\n\u03c9 cos(\u03c9)\nyi\u2032 (v) =\n[\u2212 sin2 (\u03c9) \u2212 cos2 (\u03c9)]\nyi (ui ) +\nyi (v)\nsin(\u03c9)\nsin(\u03c9)\ni\ni\ni\n=\u2212\n\n\u03c9 cos(\u03c9)\n\u03c9 X\nyi (ui ) + deg(v)y(v)\n.\nsin(\u03c9) i\nsin(\u03c9)\n\nThe vertex values satisfy (2.5), so\nX\n\u03c9\n\u03c9 cos(\u03c9)\nyi\u2032 (v) = \u2212\ndeg(v) cos(\u03c9)y(v) + deg(v)y(v)\n= 0.\nsin(\u03c9)\nsin(\u03c9)\ni\nThus the extended functions are eigenfunctions of \u2206\u221e satisfying the standard\nvertex conditions. Since the extension map is linear, and the kernel is the\nzero function, this map is also injective.\n\n2.3\n\nEigenfunctions at n2 \u03c0 2\n\nNow we turn to eigenvalues \u03bb \u2208 {n2 \u03c0 2 }. First recall [7, p. 7] that for both \u22061\nand \u2206\u221e 0 is an eigenvalue whose eigenspace is spanned by functions which\nare constant on connected components of G.\nFor n \u2265 1 these eigenspaces for \u2206\u221e also have a combinatorial interpretation, closely related to the cycles in G. If C is a cycle, and x is distance along\nthe cycle starting at some selected vertex, then the function sin(2n\u03c0x) is an\neigenfunction of \u2206\u221e . Similarly, if C is an even cycle, then sin(n\u03c0x) gives a\nsimilar eigenfunction. We can make the following observation.\n8\n\n\fLemma 2.6. Suppose G is connected, and \u03c8 is an eigenfunction of \u2206\u221e with\neigenvalue \u03bb = n2 \u03c0 2 for n \u2265 1. If \u03c8 vanishes at any vertex, then \u03c8 vanishes\nat all vertices.\nProof. Suppose \u03c8(v) = 0 for some vertex v. On any edge incident on v, the\neigenfunction is a linear combination\n\u03c8(x) = A cos(n\u03c0x) + B sin(n\u03c0x),\n\nv \u2243 0,\n\nand clearly A = 0. Since all edge lengths are 1, at all adjacent vertices w,\nwe then have \u03c8(w) = B sin(n\u03c0) = 0. By continuity of \u03c8 and connectivity of\nthe graph, \u03c8 vanishes at all vertices.\nThe next result explores the existence of eigenfunctions vanishing at no\nvertices.\nLemma 2.7. If \u03bb = (2n\u03c0)2 , for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , then \u2206\u221e has an eigenfunction vanishing at no vertices.\nIf \u03bb = (2n \u2212 1)2 \u03c0 2 , n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , then \u2206\u221e has an eigenfunction vanishing at no vertices if and only if G is bipartite.\nProof. If \u03bb = (2n\u03c0)2 , then the desired eigenfunction is simply cos(2n\u03c0x) in\nlocal coordinates on each edge.\nSuppose G is bipartite, with the two classes of vertices labelled 0 and 1.\nPick local coordinates on each edge consistent with the vertex class labels,\nand define the eigenfunction to be cos([2n \u2212 1]\u03c0x).\nSuppose conversely that for some \u03bb = (2n \u2212 1)2 \u03c0 2 , there is an eigenfunction \u03c8 vanishing at no vertex. Label the vertices v according to the sign of\n\u03c8(v). In local coordinates for an edge,\n\u03c8(x) = a cos([2n \u2212 1]\u03c0x) + b sin([2n \u2212 1]\u03c0x),\n\na 6= 0.\n\nThen if w is a vertex adjacent to v we see that \u03c8(w) = \u2212\u03c8(v), showing that\nvertices are only adjacent to vertices of opposite sign, and G is bipartite.\nIn addition to the vertex space mentioned above, an edge space may\nbe constructed using the edges of a graph as a basis (we assume the field\nis R or C). The edge space has the cycle subspace Z0 (G) generated by\ncycles, with dimension NE \u2212 NV + 1 [5, pp. 51\u201358] or [10, pp. 23\u201328]. Let\nE0 (n2 \u03c0 2 ) \u2282 E(n2 \u03c0 2 ) be those eigenfunctions of \u2206\u221e vanishing at the vertices.\n9\n\n\fTheorem 2.8.\ndimZ0 (G) = dimE0 (4n2 \u03c0 2 ).\nProof. It suffices to prove the result for a connected graph. Suppose Z0 (G)\nhas dimension M. Picking a spanning tree T for G, there is [5, p. 53]\na basis of cycles C1 , . . . , CM such that each Cj contains an edge ej \u2208\n/ T,\nwith ej not contained in any other Ci . Fix n \u2208 {1, 2, 3, . . . } and construct\neigenfunctions fj = sin(2\u03c0nx) on the edges of Cj , and 0 on all other edges.\nHere x denotes distance\nP along the cycle starting at some selected vertex. If\na linear combination\nai fi is 0, then for x \u2208 ej\n0=\n\nM\nX\n\nai fi (x) = aj fj (x),\n\nj = 1, . . . , M.\n\ni=1\n\nThere are x \u2208 ej where fj (x) 6= 0, so aj = 0 and the functions fi are\nindependent. This shows dimE0 (4n2 \u03c0 2 ) \u2265 dimZ0 (G).\n2 2\nP Now suppose that \u03c8 \u2208 E0 (4n \u03c0 ). After subtracting a linear combination\nai fi we may assume that \u03c8 vanishes on all edges not in the spanning tree\nT . For every boundary vertex v of T , \u03c8 vanishes identically on all but one\nedge of G incident on v, and by the vertex conditions it then vanishes on all\nedges incident on v. Continuing away from the boundary of the spanning\ntree, we see that \u03c8 is the 0 function.\n\nFigure 2.1: Bowtie graph\nThe proof of Theorem 2.8 provides a combinatorial basis construction for\nE0 (4n2 \u03c0 2 ). A similar construction using even cycles will provide independent\nelements of E0 ((2n\u22121)2 \u03c0 2 ), but these may not form a complete set. Consider\nthe bowtie graph in Figure 2.1, whose cycles have length 3. An eigenfunction\n\u03c8 with eigenvalue \u03c0 2 can be constructed by letting \u03c8(x) = 2 sin(\u03c0x) on the\n10\n\n\fmiddle edge. The function \u03c8 then continues as \u2212 sin(\u03c0x) on the adjacent\nfour edges, and sin(\u03c0x) on the remaining two edges. Notice that on each\nedge the function \u03c8 is an integer multiple of sin(\u03c0x).\nA generalization of the even cycles will be used for a combinatorial construction of E0 ((2n \u2212 1)2 \u03c0 2 ). Let Z1 denote the set of functions f : E \u2192 C\nsuch that\nX\nf (e) = 0, v \u2208 V.\ne\u2243v\n\nTheorem 2.9. The linear map taking f \u2208 Z1 to g(x) defined by\nge (x) = f (e) sin((2n \u2212 1)\u03c0x),\nis an isomorphism from Z1 onto E0 ((2n \u2212 1)2 \u03c0 2 ). The subspace Z1 has an\nintegral basis.\nProof. Since sin((2n\u22121)\u03c0x) = sin((2n\u22121)\u03c0(1\u2212x)), the edge orientation does\nnot affect the definition, so g is well defined. Clearly g(x) satisfies\nthe eigenP\nvalue equation and vanishes at each vertex. The condition e\u2243v f (e) = 0 for\nall v \u2208 V gives the derivative condition, so g \u2208 E0 ((2n \u2212 1)2 \u03c0 2 ). Moreover\nthe map is one to one.\nSuppose \u03c8(x) \u2208 E0 ((2n \u2212 1)2 \u03c0 2 ). Then \u03c8e (x) = ae sin((2n \u2212 1)\u03c0x) on\neach edge, and because \u03c8 satisfies the derivative conditions we have\nX\nae = 0, v \u2208 V.\ne\u2243v\n\nDefine f (e) = ae to get a linear map from E0 ((2n \u2212 1)2 \u03c0 2 ) to Z1 , which is\nalso one to one. This establishes the isomorphism.\nTo see that Z1 has an integral basis, let en be a numbering of the edges\nof G, and let xn = f (en ). The set of functions Z1 is then given by the set of\nx1 , . . . , xNE satisfying the NV equations\nX\nxn = 0.\nen \u2243v\n\nThis is a system of linear homogeneous equations whose coefficient matrix\nconsists of ones and zeros. Reduction by Gaussian elimination shows that\nthe set of solutions has a rational basis, and so an integral basis.\n\n11\n\n\f3\n\nGraph refinements\n\nNow we introduce the notion of graph refinement for graphs whose edge\nlengths are 1. Let the original combinatorial graph be denoted G1 , with the\noperator \u22061 acting on the vertex space H1 . For each integer N > 1 we will\ndefine a graph GN with vertex space HN and operator \u2206N : HN \u2192 HN by\nsubdividing each edge e \u2208 G1 into N edges. Pick local coordinates identifying\ne with [0, 1], and labelling 0 = x0 and 1 = xN . For n = 1, . . . , N \u2212 1,\nintroduce points xn = n/N in the local coordinates. The new graph GN with\nI = NV +(N \u22121)NE vertices will have the vertex set consisting of the vertices\nof G1 , together with the new vertices xn , for each edge e of G1 . The vertex\nxn is adjacent to xn\u22121 and xn+1 for n = 1, . . . , N \u2212 1. If v is a vertex in G1 ,\nand the local coordinates for edges incident on v are chosen so v is identified\nwith 0 on each edge, then v is adjacent in GN with the vertices x1 for each\nof the incident edges. An example is illustrated in Figure 3.1.\n\nG1\n\nG2\nFigure 3.1: Refinement of a graph\n\nG4\n\nAn inner product on the vertex space HN is defined by\nhf, giN =\n\n1 X\ndeg(v)f (v)g(v),\nW v\n\nW =\n\nX\n\ndeg(v) = 2NNE .\n\nv\u2208GN\n\nUsing the above identifications of edges of GN with subintervals of [0, 1],\nwe may also construct the corresponding continuous graph having edges of\nlength 1/N. These continuous graphs may all be identified with the continuous graph G\u221e corresponding to G1 . In particular they will share the inner\nproduct\nZ\n1\nhf, gi\u221e =\nf g,\nNE G\u221e\n12\n\n\fwhere NE is the number of edges in G1 . As a continuous graph, the standard\nvertex conditions hold at all vertices of GN . Although appearing different in\ndefinition, the continuous graph Laplacian \u2206\u221e has not changed as we pass\nfrom G1 to GN .\nLet \u2206N denote the following operator on the vertex space of GN ,\n\u2206N = N 2 (I \u2212 T \u22121 A).\nThe eigenspaces of these operators with eigenvalue \u03bb will be denoted EN (\u03bb),\nwhile E\u221e (\u03bb) will denote an\n\u221a eigenspace for \u2206\u221e . By (2.3) and Theorem 2.5,\nthe mapping N 2 (1 \u2212 cos( \u03bb/N)) carries eigenvalues of \u2206\u221e to eigenvalues\nof \u2206N if \u03bb/N 2 \u2208\n/ {n2 \u03c0 2\u221a\n}. That is, the eigenvalues of the normalized adja/ {(Nn\u03c0)2 } is an eigenvalue for\ncency operator are cos( \u03bb/N) whenever \u03bb \u2208\n\u2206\u221e . Notice the eigenvalues of \u2206N are approximately \u03bb/2 when \u03bb is small\ncompared to N.\nLemma 3.1. For 1 \u2264 N < \u221e the operator \u2206N is self adjoint on the vertex\nspace with the inner product hf, giN .\nProof. It suffices to check the normalized adjacency operator T \u22121 A.\nLet Ep (n2 \u03c0 2 ) denote the subspace spanned by eigenfunctions of \u2206\u221e having the form cos(n\u03c0x) on each edge (so not vanishing at the vertices). Let\nSN \u2282 L2 (G\u221e ) denote the subspace\nSN = span{Ep (N 2 \u03c0 2 ), E\u221e (\u03bb), 0 \u2264 \u03bb < N 2 \u03c0 2 }.\nHere is preliminary result describing the restriction of eigenfunctions of \u2206\u221e\nto the vertices of GN .\nProposition 3.2. The restriction map RN : SN \u2192 HN is an bijection. For\n0 \u2264 \u03bb < N 2 \u03c0 2 this map takes distinct orthogonal eigenspaces\nE\u221e (\u03bb) of \u2206\u221e\n\u221a\n2\nonto distinct orthogonal eigenspaces EN (N (1\u2212cos( \u03bb/N))) of \u2206N , and RN\ntakes Ep (N 2 \u03c0 2 ) onto EN (2N 2 ).\nProof. By Theorem 2.5 and (2.3), RN is a bijection\n\u221a from the eigenspace\nE\u221e (\u03bb) of \u2206\u221e to the eigenspace EN (N 2 (1 \u2212 cos( \u03bb/N))) of \u2206N . The 0\neigenspaces for \u2206\u221e and \u2206N are just the functions which are constant on the\nconnected components of the respective graphs, so RN is a bijection from\nE\u221e (0) to EN (0). From the proof of Lemma 2.7 we also see that RN is a\nbijection from Ep (N 2 \u03c0 2 ) to EN (2N 2 ).\n13\n\n\fSince \u2206\u221e and \u2206N are self adjoint on their respective function spaces,\nand since cos(t) is strictly decreasing on (0, \u03c0), distinct eigenspaces of \u2206\u221e ,\nwhich are orthogonal, are mapped to distinct eigenspaces of \u2206N , which are\northogonal and span HN .\nThe restriction map RN : SN \u2192 HN also has noteworthy features on the\nindividual eigenspaces E\u221e (\u03bb) of \u2206\u221e . Before stating the results, we start with\na simple observation relating the HN inner product and the\nPsums appearing in\nthe trapezoidal rule for integration. Recalling that W = v deg(v) = 2NNE ,\nthe inner product for GN satisfies the identity\nX\nW hf, giN =\ndeg(v)f (v)g(v)\nv\n\n=\n\nX\n\n[fe (x0 )ge (x0 ) + fe (xN )ge (xN ) + 2\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nfe (xn )ge (xn )].\n\nn=1\n\ne\u2208G1\n\nThese last sums are just the trapezoidal rule sums used for integrals over\nthe edges of G\u221e . With this motivation, if the continuous linear functional\nTN : C[0, 1] \u2192 C is defined by\nN\n\u22121\nX\n1\nTN (f ) =\n[f (x0 ) + f (xN ) + 2\nf (xn )],\n2N\nn=1\n\nthen\nhRN f, RN giN =\n\n1 X\nTN (fe ge ).\nNE e\u2208E\n\nThe following identities are also useful.

The cases \u03bb = k 2 \u03c0 2 with 0 \u2264 k < N are considered first.\nTheorem 3.3. Suppose f, g \u2208 E\u221e (\u03bb), with 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 N 2 \u03c0 2 .

The bases \u03a6(\u03c9k,m ) will\nbe used for efficient Fourier transform algorithms [1, p. 182] [6, p. 383].\nDefine the discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) FN : HN \u2192 CI0 \u2295m,k CIk for\nthe continuous graph G\u221e by taking the inner product of a function f \u2208 HN\nwith the bases \u03a6(\u03c9m,k ),\nFN (f ) = {hf, \u03a6j (\u03c9m,k )iN },\n\n\u03c9m,k \u2264 N\u03c0.\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe condition \u03c9m,k \u2264 N\u03c0 amounts to m = 0, . . . , N/2 \u2212 1 when N is even,\nwhich will hold in the cases of interest below. Except for the cases noted\nin Proposition 4.1 the functions of \u03a6(\u03c9m,k ) may not be orthonormal, so the\nFourier transform will not be an isometry from \u03a6(\u03c9m,k ) to CIk if the usual\ninner product is used on the range. We consider a modified inner product.\nSuppose B(\u03c9m,k ) = (bij ) is a matrix taking the basis \u03a6(\u03c9m,k ) to an orthonormal basis\nX\n\u03b7i =\nbij \u03a6j (\u03c9m,k )\n(4.3)\nj\n\nfor the same eigenspace in HN .

The Fourier transform FN : HN \u2192 CI0 \u2295m,k CIk satisfies\nFN (\u2206N f ) = {\u03bcm,k F (f )m,k },\nand is an isometry if CImk has the B(\u03c9m,k ) inner product.\nIf N is a power of 2, then FN (f ) can be computed in time O(N log2 (N)).\nProof. The inner products of (4.2) may be split into trapezoidal sums for the\nedges as in (3.1),\nFN (f ) =\n\n1 X\nTN (fe \u03a6j (\u03c9m,k )).\nNE e\n\nUsing the representation (4.1) we have\nTN (fe [Ae exp(i[\u03c90,k + 2m\u03c0]x) + Be exp(\u2212i[\u03c90,k + 2m\u03c0]x)])\n= Ae TN (exp(\u2212i\u03c90,k x)fe exp(\u22122m\u03c0ix) + Be TN (exp(i\u03c90,k x)fe exp(2m\u03c0ix)).\nIf N is a power of 2, e and k are fixed, and m = 0, . . . , N2 \u2212 1, then\nthe sequence TN (exp(\u00b1i\u03c90,k x)fe (x) exp(\u00b12m\u03c0ix)) differs trivially from the\nconventional discrete Fourier transform of the sampled data fe (xn ), which\nmay be computed [1, p. 182] [6, p. 383] in time O(N log2 (N)). Since the\nnumber of edges e and indices k is fixed, we obtain the result.\nIt remains to consider the inverse transform. Since the matrix B \u2217 B of\n(4.4) depends only on the graph and functions \u03a6j (\u03c9m,k ), these matrices are\nassumed to be precomputed. Suppose the DFT sequence (4.2) of a function\nf is given. Since the computations in (4.4) are limited to sequence blocks\n\n20\n\n\fCIk , the coefficients cj (\u03c9m,k ) for all \u03c9m,k may be computed in time O(N). It\nremains to compute\nX\nf (xn ) =\ncj (\u03c9m,k )\u03a6j (\u03c9m,k )(xn ).\nm,k\n\nFixing the edge e, the primitive frequency index k, and the basis index j,\nand taking advantage of (4.1), the remaining sum has the form\nX\nfe,k,j (xn ) = Ae exp(i\u03c90,k n/N)\ncj (\u03c9m,k ) exp(i2m\u03c0n/N)\nm\n\n+Be exp(\u2212i\u03c90,k n/N)\n\nX\n\ncj (\u03c9m,k ) exp(\u2212i2m\u03c0n/N).\n\nm\n\nThese sums may be computed with a conventional FFT. Since the number\nof edges e and primitive frequency indices k are constant, and the range of\nbasis indices j is bounded independent of m, the next result is obtained.\nTheorem 4.3. If N is a power of 2, then the inverse DFT can be computed\nin time O(N log2 (N)).\n\n5\n\nA family of examples\n\nA relatively simple family of examples is provided by the complete bipartite\ngraphs K(m, 2) on m, 2 vertices. The m = 4 case is portrayed in Figure\n5.1. Discussion of these graphs is facilitated if the vertices are colored, the 2\nvertices of degree m being red and the remaining m vertices blue.\nSuppose v is a vertex, and {ui } are the vertices adjacent to v. Then the\noperator \u22061 on the m + 2 dimensional vertex space is given by\ndeg(v)\nX\n1\n\u22061 f (v) = f (v) \u2212\nf (ui ).\ndeg(v) i=1\n\nEigenvalues \u03bc for \u22061 are 0, 1, 2, with 1 having multiplicity m.

A function f (v) will satisfy\nPdeg(v)\n\u22061 f (v) = f (v) if and only if i=1\nf (ui ) = 0 for every vertex v. Number\nthe red vertices r1 and r2 , and the two blue vertices b1 , . . . , bm . For j =\n1, . . . , m \u2212 1, independent eigenfunctions are\nn 1, v = bj o\n\u03c8j (v) = \u22121, v = bj+1 , .\n0, otherwise\nThere is one additional independent eigenfunction\nn 1, v = r1 , o\n\u03c8m (v) = \u22121, v = r2 , .\n0, otherwise\nTo establish the independence of \u03c81 , . . . , \u03c8m , note that if\nm\nX\n\ncj \u03c8j (v) = 0,\n\nj=1\n\nthen cm = 0 by evaluation at r1 , and evaluation at the points bj leads to\nequations\nc1 = 0, c1 = c2 , . . . , cm\u22121 = cm .\nMoving to the continuous graph, identify each edge with [0, 1] so the blue\nvertex is identified with 0. Consider the\n\u221a eigenvalues \u03bb and corresponding\neigenfunctions \u03a8 for \u2206\u221e , focusing on \u03bb \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]. Of course we have\n22\n\n\f\u03bb0 = 0 with the constant eigenfunction \u03a8(0) = 1. From \u03bcj = 1 we obtain\neigenvalues\n\u221a\n\u03bb = cos\u22121 (1 \u2212 \u03bcj ) = cos\u22121 (0) = \u03c0/2, 3\u03c0/2.\n\nThat is, \u03bb = (\u03c0/2)2 and \u03bb = (3\u03c0/2)2 are eigenvalues, each with multiplicity\nm. The corresponding eigenfunctions \u03a8j (\u03c0/2) and \u03a8j (3\u03c0/2) are obtained by\nextrapolation as in Lemma 2.2 from the vertex values of \u03c8j .\nThis graph [5, p. 53] has m \u2212 1 independent cycles, all of which are\neven. One basis of cycles Ci is given by the vertex sequence r1 , bi , r2 , bi+1 , r1 .\nEach Ci supports eigenfunctions \u03a8i (\u03c0) and \u03a8i (2\u03c0) which are respectively\n\u00b1 sin(\u03c0x) and \u00b1 sin(2\u03c0x) on the edges of the cycle.\nFinally, there are two additional independent eigenfunctions, \u03a8m (\u03c0) having values cos(\u03c0x) and \u03a8m (2\u03c0) with values cos(2\u03c0x) on the edges of G. This\ngives a total of\n2NE = 4m = 2m + 2(m \u2212 1) + 2\nindependent eigenfunctions for \u2206\u221e with eigenvalues 0 < \u03bb \u2264 2\u03c0.\nThis graph has an obvious involution in which r1 and r2 are interchanged,\nand we may split the eigenspaces into even and odd subspaces with respect to\nthe involution. Notice that the eigenfunctions \u03a8m (\u03c0), \u03a8m (2\u03c0), \u03a8i (\u03c0/2) and\n\u03a8i (3\u03c0/2) for i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1 are even while \u03a8m (\u03c0/2), \u03a8m (3\u03c0/2), \u03a8i (\u03c0) and\n\u03a8i (2\u03c0) for i = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1 are odd. By restricting to the even, respectively\nodd, subspaces we may treat the case of a star graph with m edges and\nboundary vertices with the conditions fe\u2032 (0) = 0, respectively fe (0) = 0.\n\n23\n\n\fReferences\n[1] K.
