Different aspects of neurocomputation take contact on this problem: how\nbrain stores information and how brain processes it to take decisions or to create new information. Other universal\nproperties of this system are more evident. One of them is the existence of a regular daily behavior: the sleep-wake\ncycle [2, 3]. The internal circadian rhythm is closely synchronized with the cycle of sun light. Roughly speaking and\ndepending on the particular species, the brain is awake during the day and it is slept during the night, or vice versa.\nAll mammals and birds sleep. There is no a well established law relating the size of the animal with the daily time it\nspends sleeping, but, in general, large animals tend to sleep less than small animals. Hence, at first sight, the bistable\nsleep-wake behavior seems not depend on the precise architecture of the brain nor on its size. If we represent the\nbrain as a complex network this property would mean that this possible bistability should not depend on the topology\n(structure) nor on the number of nodes (size) of the network.\nSo, on one side, it has been recently argued in [4] that the distribution of functional connections p(k) in the human\nbrain, where p(k) represents the probability of finding an element with k connections to other elements of the network,\nfollows the same distribution of a scale-free network [5]. Thus, in that work [4], the human brain is divided in 34x64x64\nsites (called voxels) and the magnetic resonance activity of all the voxels is recorded. Let us observe at this point that\nif the human brain has around 1011 neurons, then a voxel has around 105 neurons. The calculation of the correlation\nmatrix among the set of the voxels activities shows a power law behavior, p(k) \u223c k\u2212\u03b3 , with \u03b3 around 2. This finding\nmeans that there are regions in the brain that participate in a large number of tasks while most of the regions are only\ninvolved in a tiny fraction of the brain's activities.\nOn the other side, it has been shown by Kuhn et al. [6] the nonlinear processing of synaptic inputs in cortical\nneurons. They studied the response of a model neuron with a simultaneous increase of excitation and inhibition. They\nfound that the firing rate of the model neuron first increases, reaches a maximum, and then decreases at higher input\nrates. Functionally, this means that the firing rate, commonly assumed to be the carrier of information in the brain,\nis a non-monotonic function of balanced input. These findings do not depend on details of the model and, hence, are\nrelevant to cells of other cortical areas as well.\nPutting together all these facts, we arrive to the central question that we want to bring to the reader: are we able\nto reproduce the bistability in a complex network independently of the topology and of the number of nodes?. The\nanswer is 'yes' (Fig. 1). What kind of local dynamics and coupling among nodes must be implemented in order to get\nthis behavior?. In the next section, we give a possible strategy for the coupling and the local dynamics which should\nbe implemented in a few or many units network in order to find bistable behavior. An example of this implementation\n\n\fFIGURE 1. QUESTION: Is it possible to implement some kind of coupling and nonlinear dynamics in each node of a complex\nnetwork in order to get bistability?. ANSWER: Yes.\n\nis given in [7]. Here we center our attention in the bistability present in the case of a few coupled functional units. Four\ndifferent discrete models in two and three dimensions are collected. In view of the results, we want to suggest with all\nthese examples the possibility of 'constructivism' in the world of complex systems.\n\nMODELS OF A FEW COUPLED FUNCTIONAL UNITS\nGeneral model\nOur approach consider the so called functional unit, i.e. a neuron or group of neurons (voxels), as a discrete nonlinear\noscillator with two possible states: active (meaning one type of activity) or not (meaning other type of activity). Hence,\nin this naive vision of the brain as a networked system, if xin , with 0 < xin < 1, represents a measurement of the ith\nfunctional unit activity at time n, it can be reasonable to take the most elemental local nonlinearity, for instance, a\nlogistic evolution [8], which presents a quadratic term, as a first toy-model for the local neuronal activity:\nxin+1 = p\u0304i xin (1 \u2212 xin).\n\nFIGURE 2.\n\n(1)\n\nDiscrete nonlinear model for the local evolution of a functional unit.\n\nIt presents only one stable state for each p\u0304i . Then, there is no bistability in the basic component of our models.\nFor p\u0304i < 1, the dynamics dissipates to zero, xin = 0, then it can represent the functional unit with no activity. For\n1 < p\u0304i < 4, the dynamics is non null and it would represent an active functional unit. This local transition is controlled\nby the parameter p\u0304i . The functional dependence of this local coupling on the neighbor states is essential in order to\nget a good brain-like behavior (i.e., as far as the bistability of the sleep-wake cycle is concerned) of the network. As a\nfirst approach, we can take p\u0304i as a linear function depending on the actual mean value, Xni , of the neighboring signal\nactivity and expanding the interval (1, 4) in the form:\np\u0304i\np\u0304i\n\n=\nor\n=\n\npi (3Xni + 1),\n\n(excitation coupling)\n\n(2)\n\npi (\u22123Xni + 4), (inhibition coupling)\n\n(3)\n\nwith\nXni =\n\n1\nNi\n\nNi\n\n\u2211 xnj .\n\n(4)\n\nj=1\n\nNi is the number of neighbors of the ith functional unit, and pi , which gives us an idea of the interaction of the\nfunctional unit with its first-neighbor functional units, is the control parameter. This parameter runs in the range\n0 < pi < pmax , where pmax \u0017 1. When pi = p for all i, the dynamical behavior of these networks with the excitation\ntype coupling [7] presents an attractive global null configuration that has been identified as the turned off state of\nthe network. Also they show a completely synchronized non-null stable configuration that represents the turned on\nstate of the network. Moreover, a robust bistability between these two perfect synchronized states is found in that\nparticular model (see [7] for more details). For different models with a few coupled functional units we sketch in the\n\n\fnext subsections the regions where they present a bistable behavior. The details of the complete unfolding of these\ndynamical systems can be found in the references [9, 10, 11].\n\nModels of two functional units\nLet us start with the simplest case of two interconnected (xn , yn ) functional units. Three different combinations of\ncouplings are possible: (excitation, excitation), (excitation, inhibition) and (inhibition, inhibition).\n\nFIGURE 3.\n\nTwo functional coupled units.\n\nThe first two cases of coupling present bistability in different regions of the parameter space. The third case also\nshows bistability in a very narrow interval of parameter space but it requires a very fine inspection [12] that we shelve\nfor a further work.\n\nModel with mutual excitation\nThe dynamics of the (excitation, excitation) case [9] is given by the coupled equations:\nxn+1\nyn+1\n\n=\n=\n\np (3yn + 1)xn (1 \u2212 xn),\np (3xn + 1)yn (1 \u2212 yn).\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nThe regions of the parameter space (Fig. 4) where we can find bistability are:\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n1\n\nFor 0.75 < p < 0.86, the synchronized state, x+ = (x\u0304, x\u0304) = P4 , with x\u0304 = 13 {1 + (4 \u2212 3p ) 2 }, which arises from a\nsaddle-node bifurcation for the critical value p = 0.75, is a stable turned on state. This state coexists with the\nturned off state x\u03b8 = 0. The system presents now bistability and depending on the initial conditions, the final state\ncan be x\u03b8 or x+ . Switching on the system from x\u03b8 requires a level of noise in both functional units sufficient to\nrender the activity on the basin of attraction of x+ . On the contrary, switching off the two functional units network\ncan be done, for instance, by making zero the activity of one functional unit, or by doing the coupling p lower\nthan 0.75.\nFor 0.86 < p < 0.95, the active state of the network is now a period-2 oscillation, namely the period-2 cycle\n(P5 , P6 ) in Fig. 4. This new dynamical state bifurcates from x+ for p = 0.86. A smaller noise is necessary to\nactivate the system from x\u03b8 . Making zero the activity of one functional unit continues to be a good strategy to\nturn off the network.\nFor 0.95 < p < 1, the active state acquires a new frequency and presents quasiperiodicity (the invariant closed\ncurves of Fig. 4). It is still possible to switch off the network by putting to zero one of the functional units.\n\nFIGURE 4.\n\nBistability in 2 functional units with excitation type coupling.\n\n\fModel with excitation + inhibition\nThe dynamics of the (excitation, inhibition) case [10] is given by the coupled equations:\nxn+1\nyn+1\n\n=\n=\n\np (3yn + 1)xn(1 \u2212 xn),\np (\u22123xn + 4)yn (1 \u2212 yn).\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nThe regions of the parameter space (Fig. 5) where we can find bistability are:\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nFor 1.051 < p < 1.0851, a stable period three cycle (Q1 , Q2 , Q3 ) appears in the system. It coexists with the\nfixed point P4 . When p is increased, a period-doubling cascade takes place and generates successive cycles of\nhigher periods 3x2n . The system presents bistability. Depending on the initial conditions, both populations (xn , yn )\noscillate in a periodic orbit or, alternatively, settle down in the fixed point. The borders between the two basins\nare complex.\nFor 1.0851 < p < 1.0997, an aperiodic dynamics is possible. The period-doubling cascade has finally given\nbirth to an order three cyclic chaotic band(s) (A31 , A32 , A33 ). The system can now present an irregular oscillation\nbesides the stable equilibrium with final fixed populations. The two basins are now fractal.\n\nFIGURE 5.\n\nBistability in 2 functional units with excitation+inhibition type coupling.\n\nModels of three functional units\nFollowing the strategy given by relation (2-3) several models with three functional units can be established. We have\nstudied in detail two of them [11] and their bistable behavior is reported here.\n\nModel with local mutual excitation\nLet us start with the case of three alternatively interconnected (xn , yn , zn ) functional units under a mutual excitation\nscheme.\n\nFIGURE 6.\n\nThree alternatively coupled functional units under the excitation scheme.\n\nThen the dynamics of the system is given by the coupled equations:\nxn+1\nyn+1\nzn+1\n\n=\n=\n=\n\np (3yn + 1)xn (1 \u2212 xn),\np (3zn + 1)yn(1 \u2212 yn),\np (3xn + 1)zn (1 \u2212 zn ).\n\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n\n\fFIGURE 7.\n\nBistability in 3 functional units with local excitation type coupling.\n\nThe regions of the parameter space where we have found bistability are:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nFor 0.93310 < p < 0.95334, a big invariant closed curve (ICC) C1 coexists with a period-3 orbit that bifurcates,\nfirst to an order 3-cyclic ICC (Fig. 7), and finally to an order-3 weakly chaotic ring (WCR) before disappearing.\nFor 0.98418 < p < 0.98763, the ICC C1 coexists with another ICC C2 (see Ref. [11]) that becomes chaotic, by\nfollowing a period doubling cascade of tori, before disappearing.\nFor 1.00360 < p < 1.00402, the ICC C1 coexists with a high period orbit that gives rise to an ICC C3. This ICC\nalso becomes a chaotic band (see Ref. [11]) by following a period doubling cascade of tori before disappearing.\nModel with global mutual excitation\n\nWe expose now the case of three globally interconnected (xn , yn , zn ) functional units under a mutual excitation\nscheme.\n\nFIGURE 8. Three globally coupled functional units under the excitation scheme.\n\nThen the dynamics of the system is given by the coupled equations:\nxn+1\nyn+1\nzn+1\n\n=\n=\n=\n\np (xn + yn + zn + 1)xn(1 \u2212 xn),\np (xn + yn + zn + 1)yn(1 \u2212 yn),\np (xn + yn + zn + 1)zn (1 \u2212 zn).\n\nFIGURE 9. Bistability in 3 functional units with global excitation type coupling.\n\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n\n\fFor the whole range of the parameter, 0 < p < 1.17, bistability is present in this system:\n\u2022\n\nFirstly, two order-2 cyclic ICC coexist before becoming two order-2 cyclic chaotic attractors by contact bifurcations of heteroclinic type. Finally the two chaotic attractors become a single one before disappearing.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOne of the more challenging problems in nonlinear science is the goal of understanding the properties of neuronal\ncircuits [13]. Synchrony and bistability are two important dynamical behaviors found in those circuits. In this work,\ndifferent coupling schemes for networks with local logistic dynamics are proposed. It is observed that these types of\ncouplings generate a global bistability between two different dynamical states. This property seems to be topology\nand size independent. This is a direct consequence of the local mean-field multiplicative coupling among the firstneighbors. If a formal and naive relationship is established between these two states and the sleep-wake states of\na brain, respectively, one would be tempted to assert that these types of couplings in a network, regardless of its\nsimplicity, give us a good qualitative model for explaining that specific bistability. Following this insight, different\nlow-dimensional systems with logistic components coupled under these schemes have been presented. The regions\nwhere the dynamics shows bistability have been identified. Other low and high dimensional models merit a similar\ndetailed inspection in the future. This study could put in evidence the possibility of 'constructivism' in the world of\ncomplex systems.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nR.
