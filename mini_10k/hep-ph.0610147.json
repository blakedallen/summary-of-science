One of the possibility is to pull down the Planck scale to TeV range by\nconsidering the compactified extra dimensions of large size [1]. The assumption that the extra\ndimensions are at the order of submilimeter distance, for two extra dimensions, the hierarchy\nproblem in the fundamental scales could be solved and the true scale of quantum gravity would\nbe no more the Planck scale but it is of the order of electroweak (EW) scale. This is the\ncase that the gravity spreads over all the volume including the extra dimensions, however, the\nmatter fields are restricted in four dimensions, so called four dimensional (4D) brane. Another\npossibility, which is based on the non-factorizable geometry, is introduced by Randall and\nSundrum [2] (the RS1 model) and, in this scenario, the extra dimension is compactified to\nS 1 /Z2 orbifold with two 4D brane boundaries. Here, the gravity is localized in one of the\nboundary, so called the Planck (hidden) brane, which is away from another boundary, the TeV\n(visible) brane where we live. The size of extra dimension is related to the vacuum expectation\nof a scalar field and its fluctuation over the expectation value is called the radion field (see\nsection 2 for details). The radion in the RS1 model has been studied in several works in the\nliterature [3]-[13] (see [14] for extensive discussion).\nIn the present work, we study the possible lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays of the radion\nfield r. The LFV interactions exist at least in one loop level in the extended standard model\n(SM), so called \u03bdSM, which is constructed by taking neutrinos massive and by permitting the\nlepton mixing mechanism [15]. Their negligibly small branching ratios (BRs) stimulate one to\ngo beyond and they are worthwhile to examine since they open a window to test new models\nand to ensure considerable information about the restrictions of the free parameters, with the\nhelp of the possible accurate measurements. The LFV interactions are carried by the flavor\nchanging neutral currents (FCNCs) and in the SM with extended Higgs sector (the multi Higgs\ndoublet model) they can exist at tree level. Among multi Higgs doublet models, the two Higgs\ndoublet model (2HDM) is a candidate for the lepton flavor violation. In this model, the lepton\nflavor violation is driven by the new scalar Higgs bosons S, scalar h0 and pseudo scalar A0 , and\nit is controlled by the Yukawa couplings appearing in lepton-lepton-S vertices.\nHere, we predict the BRs of the LFV r decays in the 2HDM, in the framework of the RS1\nscenario 1 . The BRs of these processes are sensitive to the new Yukawa couplings arising with\n1\n\nThe flavor conserving decays of the radion can exist in the tree level and the theoretical values of the BRs\nare free from the loop suppressions. For the heavy flavor output \u03c4 \u03c4 the BR reaches to the numerical values of\nthe order of 10\u22122 for the small values of the radion mass, mr < 200 GeV . In the case of light flavor output\n\n1\n\n\fthe addition of the new Higgs doublet and they enhance with the increasing values of the these\ncouplings. Therefore, besides their important role in the construction of the FCNC in the tree\nlevel and the existence of the LFV interactions, these Yukawa couplings play a crucial role in\nthe enhancement of the theoretical values of the BRs. In our calculations, we observe that\nthe BRs of the processes we study are at most of the order of 10\u22128 , for the small values of\nradion mass mr and for the large values of the Yukawa couplings, and, their sensitivities to mr\ndecrease with the increasing values of mr . Among the LFV decays we study, the r \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bc\u00b1\ndecay would be the most suitable one to measure its BR.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present the effective vertex and the\nBRs of LFV r decays in the 2HDM, by respecting the RS1 scenario. Section 3 is devoted\nto a discussion and to our conclusions. In the appendix, we present the interaction vertices\nappearing in the calculations.\n\n2\n\nThe LFV RS1 radion decay in the 2HDM\n\nThe RS1 model is an interesting candidate in order to explain the well known hierarchy problem.\nIt is formulated as two 4D surfaces (branes) in 5D world in which the extra dimension is\ncompactified into S 1 /Z2 orbifold. In this model, the SM fields are assumed to live on one of the\nbrane, so called the TeV brane. On the other hand, the gravity peaks near the other brane, so\ncalled the Planck brane and extends into the bulk with varying strength. Here, 5D cosmological\nconstant is non vanishing and both branes have equal and opposite tensions so that the low\nenergy effective theory has flat 4D spacetime. The metric of such 5D world reads\nds2 = e\u22122 A(y) \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2212 dy 2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere A(y) = k |y|, k is the bulk curvature constant, y is the extra dimension parametrized as\n\ny = R \u03b8. The exponential factor e\u2212k L with L = R \u03c0, is the warp factor which causes that all\nthe mass terms are rescaled in the TeV brane. With a rough estimate L \u223c 30/k, all mass terms\nare brought down to the TeV scale. The size L of extra dimension is related to the vacuum\n\nexpectation of the field L(x) and its fluctuation over the expectation value is called the radion\nfield r. In order to avoid the violation of equivalence principle, L(x) should acquire a mass\nand, to stabilize r, a mechanism was proposed by Goldberger and Wise [3], by introducing a\npotential for L(x). Finally, the metric in 5D is defined as [4]\nds2 = e\u22122 A(y)\u22122 F (x) \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2212 (1 + 2 F (x)) dy 2 ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u03bc\u03bc (ee) the numerical value of the BR is of the order of 10\u22124 (10\u22129 ) for mr < 200 GeV (see [9] for the explicit\nexpressions of these decay widths).\n\n2\n\n\fwhere the radial fluctuations are carried by the scalar field F (x),\nF (x) = \u221a\n\n1\n6 MP l e\u2212k L\n\nr(x) .\n\n(3)\n\nHere the field r(x) is the normalized radion field (see [5]). At the orbifold point \u03b8 = \u03c0 (TeV\nbrane) the induced metric reads,\n\u03b3\n\nind\ng\u03bc\u03bd\n= e\u22122 A(L)\u22122 v r(x) \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd .\n\u221av\n6\u039b\n\nHere the parameter \u03b3 reads \u03b3 =\n\n(4)\n\nwith \u039b = MP l e\u2212k L and v is the vacuum expectation\n\nvalue of the SM Higgs boson. The radion is the additional degree of freedom of the 4D effective\ntheory and we study the possible LFV decays of this field.\nThe FCNCs at tree level can exist in the 2HDM and they induce the flavor violating (FV)\ninteractions with large BRs. The FV r decays, r \u2192 l1\u2212 l2+ , can exist at least in one loop level in\n\nthe framework of the 2HDM.

Here g ind\nis the determinant of the induced metric on the TeV brane where the 2HDM particles live.\nHere, we assume that the Higgs doublet \u03c61 has a non-zero vacuum expectation value to ensure\nthe ordinary masses of the gauge fields and the fermions, however, the second doublet has\nno vacuum expectation value, namely, we choose the doublets \u03c61 and \u03c62 and their vacuum\nexpectation values as\n1\n\u03c61 = \u221a\n2\n\n\"\n\n0\nv + H0\n\n!\n\n+\n\n\u221a\n\n2\u03c7+\ni\u03c70\n\n!#\n\n1\n; \u03c62 = \u221a\n2\n\n\u221a\n\n2H +\nH1 + iH2\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nand\n1\n< \u03c61 >= \u221a\n2\n\n0\nv\n\n!\n\n; < \u03c62 >= 0 .\n\n(7)\n\nThis choice ensures that the mixing between neutral scalar Higgs bosons is switched off and it\nwould be possible to separate the particle spectrum so that the SM particles are collected in the\n2\n\nE\nIn the following, we replace \u03be E with \u03beN\nwhere \"N\" denotes the word \"neutral\".\n\n3\n\n\ffirst doublet and the new particles in the second one 3 .

This interaction results in\nthe radion-(SM or new) Higgs mixing which can bring a sizeable contribution to the physical quantities studied.\nHere, we assume that there is no mixing between first and second doublet and only the first Higgs doublet has\nvacuum expectation value. Therefore, we choose that there exists a mixing between the radion and the SM\nHiggs field, but not between the radion and the new Higgs fields. This is the case that the lepton flavor violation\nis not affected by the mixing since the SM Higgs field is not responsible for the FCNC current at tree level.\n\n4\n\n\fNotice that the vierbein fields are the square root of the metric and they satisfy the relation\ne\u03bca ea\u03bd = g ind \u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(14)\n\nUsing eqs.

With the addition of Dirac mass term mD (y) =\n\u2032\n\nm A k(y) (A\u2032 (y) =\n\ndA(y)\n)\ndy\n\nto the lagrangian of bulk fermions, the fermion mass hierarchy can\n\nbe obtained since they have different locations, regulated by a localization parameter c =\nm/k, in the extra dimension (see for example [16, 17, 18, 19]). Furthermore, the SM fermions\nare obtained by considering SU(2)L doublet \u03c8L and singlet \u03c8R with separate Z2 projection\nconditions: Z2 \u03c8R = \u03b35 \u03c8R and Z2 \u03c8L = \u2212\u03b35 \u03c8L (see for example [20]) and the localization\n\nparameters cL and cR assigned to each left and right handed fermion. If cL;R >\n\n1\n2\n\n(cL;R < 12 ),\n\nthe zero mode left;right handed fermions are localized near the hidden (visible) brane and, for\ncL;R = 21 , they have constant profiles. Notice that the parameters cL and cR should be restricted\nsuch that the observed masses of fermions are obtained. In addition to the SM fermions (the\nzero mode ones) the KK modes of left and right handed fermions arise and these modes depend\non the localization parameters cL and cR . In this scenario, the BRs of the LFV radion decays\nbecome sensitive to the different locations of left and right handed (zero mode and KK mode)\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nleptons. This sensitivity is due to the couplings coming from r \u2212 liL(R) \u2212 liR(L) , r \u2212 liL(R) \u2212 liL(R)\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nand S \u2212 liL(R) \u2212 liR(L) interactions, where S = h0 , A0 and n = 0, 1, 2, .... Here we can take\n\ntwo different possibilities: The first possibility is that the existence of the LFV is based on\nthe different locations of different flavors (see for example [21, 22, 23]). In this case the new\nYukawa couplings, appearing with the interaction of zero mode leptons and new Higgs bosons,\nsensitive to the locations of the corresponding leptons and the sources of the flavor violation are\nexplicitly the localization parameters. If the leptons are far from (near to) the visible brane the\ncouplings are suppressed (enhanced). Furthermore, the strengths of the couplings of KK mode\nleptons and new Higgs bosons are regulated by the locations of the lepton fields. In the second\npossibility, the flavor violation is carried by the new Yukawa couplings in four dimensions by\nassuming that the localization effects are embedded into the definition of new Yukawa couplings\nand, with the additional effects coming from the KK mode leptons, the role of extra dimension\nbecomes the enhancement in the physical quantities . In both scenarios, the couplings of the\n5\n\n\fradion with the leptons are regulated by the localization of the zero mode leptons and there\nexists an additional effect coming from the radion-KK mode lepton vertices. At first sight, it\nis expected that if the zero leptons are far from (near to) the visible brane these couplings are\nsuppressed (enhanced). However, one needs a detailed analysis to take into account the bulk\nlepton contributions and their localization effects.\nNow, we are ready to calculate the matrix element for the LFV radion decay. The decay\nof the radion to leptons with different flavors exits at least in one loop order, with the help\nof internal new Higgs bosons S = h0 , A0 . The possible vertex and self energy diagrams are\npresented in Fig. 2. After addition of all these diagrams, the divergences which occur in the\nloop integrals are eliminated and the matrix element square for this decay is obtained as\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n|M|2 = 2 m2r \u2212 (ml1\u2212 + ml2+ )2 |A|2 ,\n\n(16)\n\nvert\n+ fhvert\n+ fAvert\nA = fhself\n+ fAself\n+ fhvert\n0 h0 + fA0 A0 ,\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n(17)\n\nwhere\n\nand the explicit expressions of the functions appearing in eq. (17) are given in Appendix B.\nE\nNotice that in eq. (23) the flavor changing couplings \u03beN,l\nrepresent the effective interaction\nji\n\nbetween the internal lepton i, (i = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ) and the outgoing j = 1 (j = 2) lepton (anti lepton).\nE\nHere, we choose the couplings \u03beN,l\nreal.\nji\n\nFinally, the BR for r \u2192 l1\u2212 l2+ can be obtained by using the matrix element square as\nBR(r \u2192 l1\u2212 l2+ ) =\n\n1\n|M|2\n,\n16 \u03c0 mr \u0393r\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u0393r is the total decay width of radion r. In our numerical analysis, we consider the BR\ndue to the production of sum of charged states, namely\nBR(r \u2192 l1\u00b1 l2\u00b1 ) =\n\n3\n\n\u0393(r \u2192 ( \u0304l1 l2 +  \u0304l2 l1 ))\n.\n\u0393r\n\n(19)\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn four dimensions, the higher dimensional gravity is observed as it has new states with spin\n2,1 and 0, so called, the graviton, the gravivector, the graviscalar. These states interact with\nthe particles in the underlying theory. In the RS1 model with one extra dimension, the spin 0\ngravity particle radion r interacts with the particles of the theory (2HDM in our case) on the\n\n6\n\n\fTeV brane and this interaction occurs over the trace of the energy-momentum tensor T\u03bc\u03bc with\nthe strength 1/\u039br ,\nLint =\n\nr \u03bc\nT ,\n\u039br \u03bc\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u039br is at the order of TeV. The radion interacts with gluon (g) pair or photon (\u03b3) pair in\none loop order from the trace anomaly. For the radion mass mr \u2264 150 GeV , the decay width\n\nis dominated by r \u2192 gg. For the masses which are beyond the WW and ZZ thresholds, the\n\nmain decay mode is r \u2192 W W . In the present work, we study the possible LFV decays of the\n\nRS1 radion in the 2HDM and estimate the BRs of these decays for different values of radion\nmasses. We take the total decay width \u0393r of the radion by considering the dominant decays\nr \u2192 gg (\u03b3\u03b3, f f, W + W \u2212 , ZZ, SS) where S are the neutral Higgs particles (see [9] for the explicit\n\nexpressions of these decay widths). Here, we include the possible processes in the \u0393r according\nto the mass of the radion.\nThe flavor violating r decays r \u2192 l1\u2212 l2+ can exist at least in one loop level, in the framework\nE 5\nof the 2HDM and the flavor violation is carried by the Yukawa couplings \u03be \u0304N,ij\n. In the version\nof 2HDM where the FCNC are permitted, these couplings are free parameters which should be\nrestricted by using the present and forthcoming experiments. At first, we assume that these\ncouplings are symmetric with respect to the flavor indices i and j. Furthermore, we take that\nthe couplings which contain at least one \u03c4 index are dominant and we choose a broad range\nE\nfor these couplings, by respecting the upper limit prediction of \u03be \u0304N,\u03c4\n\u03bc (see [24] and references\ntherein), which is obtained by using the experimental uncertainty, 10\u22129 , in the measurement of\nthe muon anomalous magnetic moment and by assuming that the new physics effects can not\nE\nexceed this uncertainty. For the coupling \u03be \u0304N,\u03c4\ne , the restriction is estimated by using this upper\nlimit and the experimental upper bound of BR of \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 decay, BR \u2264 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221211 [25]. Finally,\nthis coupling is taken in the range 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22121 GeV (see [26]). For the Yukawa coupling \u03be \u0304E ,\nN,\u03c4 \u03c4\n\nwe have no explicit restriction region and we use the numerical values which are greater than\nE\n\u03be \u0304N,\u03c4\n\u03bc . Throughout our calculations we use the input values given in Table (1).\nIn Fig.3 we present mr dependence of the BR (r \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bc\u00b1 ).

These BRs, especially BR (r \u2192 \u03bc\u00b1 e\u00b1 ), are negligibly small.\n\nNow, we present the Yukawa coupling dependencies of the BRs of the decays under consid-\n\neration, for different radion masses .\nE\n\u00b1 \u00b1\n \u0304E\nFig.5 represents the \u03be \u0304N,\u03c4\n\u03c4 dependence of the BR (r \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bc ) for \u03beN,\u03c4 \u03bc = 10 GeV .

Similar to the r \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bc\u00b1 decay, the BR is strongly sensitive to the radion mass.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nThe LFV decays of the radion in the RS1 model strongly depend on the radion mass and the\nYukawa couplings. The BR for r \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bc\u00b1 decay is of the order of 10\u22128 for the small values of\nradion mass mr and it decreases with the increasing values of mr . On the other hand, the BRs\n\nfor r \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 e\u00b1 (r \u2192 \u03bc\u00b1 e\u00b1 ) decays are of the order of 10\u221212 (10\u221215 ) for the small values of mr .\nThese results show that, among these processes, the LFV r \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bc\u00b1 decay would be the most\n\nappropriate one to measure its BR. The most probable production of radion is due to the gluon\nfusion, gg \u2192 r [9]) and, based on the existing cross section values for the radion production via\n8\n\n\fgluon fusion and the typical integrated luminosities expected at LHC, a rough estimation of the\nnumber of events for the \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bc\u00b1 final state is missing at present. The goal being to check that\nthis number of events is significant statistically, and hopefully, the forthcoming experimental\nresults of this decay would be useful in order to test the possible signals coming from the extra\ndimensions and new physics which results in flavor violation.\n\nA\n\nThe vertices appearing in the present work\n\nIn this section we present the vertices appearing in our calculations.
