The calculations aimed mainly at\nreproducing the observed distribution of orbital periods P\nof CVs, in particular the minimum period at 80 min and the\ndearth of systems in the 2-3 h period range (see e.g. King\n1988 for a review). Based on the most popular explanation\nfor this period gap, the disrupted magnetic braking model\n(cf. Rappaport, Verbunt and Joss 1983; Spruit and Ritter\n1983), evolutionary sequences constructed with full stellar\nmodels or simplified bipolytrope models (cf. Hameury et al.\n1988; Hameury 1991; Kolb and Ritter 1992; and references\ntherein) reproduce the broad features of the observed P distribution. Despite the significant uncertainties in the underlying stellar input physics (e.g. opacities, equation of state,\netc...), the lack of a reliable description of angular momentum losses J \u0307 that drive the mass transfer provided sufficient\nfreedom that it was always possible to find a set of secondary\nstar models which reasonably fit the period gap.\nInput physics like atmospheric opacities and the outer\nc 0000 RAS\n\nboundary condition are essential for a comparison with observable quantities such as colours or spectral types.\nThe spectral type and the orbital period (P \u221d\n(R3 /M )1/2 ; R and M are the secondary radius and mass)\nprovide a unique set of constraints that test the structure\nboth of the secondary's interior and its outermost layers. As\nwe shall show below, these can be used to find constraints\non the actual orbital braking strength J \u0307 as well.\nPreviously, an analysis of this kind was hampered by\nthe lack of knowledge, both theoretical and observational,\nof stars in the low\u2013mass range populated by CV secondaries. Here we make use of the marked and independent\nprogress in the study of low\u2013mass stars over the past decade.\nA wealth of ground-based and spaced-based observations has\nsignificantly improved our knowledge of the photometric and\nspectroscopic properties of stars at the bottom of the main\nsequence. In parallel, recent theoretical work has demonstrated the necessity to use accurate internal physics and\nouter boundary conditions based on non\u2013grey atmosphere\nmodels to correctly describe the structure and evolution of\nlow\u2013mass objects (Burrows et al. 1993; Baraffe et al. 1995,\n1997, 1998; Chabrier and Baraffe 1997, 2000, and references\n\n\f2\n\nI. Baraffe, U. Kolb\n\ntherein). These interior models, combined with recent, much\nimproved models of cool atmospheres and synthetic spectra (see the review of Allard et al. 1997, and references\ntherein) allow one to calculate self\u2013consistent magnitudes\nand synthetic colours of low\u2013mass stars. These can be compared directly to observed quantities, avoiding the use of\nuncertain empirical effective temperature Teff and bolometric correction scales. The agreement between models and\nobservations for (i) eclipsing binary systems (Chabrier and\nBaraffe 1995), (ii) mass\u2013magnitude and mass\u2013spectral type\nrelations (Baraffe and Chabrier, 1996; Chabrier et al. 1996),\n(iii) colour\u2013magnitude diagrams (Baraffe et al. 1997, 1998)\nand (iv) synthetic spectra (Leggett et al. 1996; Allard et\nal. 1997), demonstrate how reliable the theory of low\u2013mass\nstars already is.\nRecently, Beuermann et al. (1998) used our preliminary calculations based on these next\u2013generation low\u2013mass\nstar models and compared calculated and observed spectral\ntypes (SpT) of CV secondaries. Beuermann et al. (1998)\nfound that CVs with donors that are nuclearly evolved,\nwith a substantial amount of central hydrogen depletion,\ncan account for the late spectral types in long\u2013period systems (P/h >\n\u223c 6), but not in those close to the upper edge of\nthe period gap (3 <\n\u223c 6). Higher mass transfer rates\n\u223c P/h <\nas usually assumed can account for the latter.\nThe purpose of the present paper is to give a detailed\naccount of the full set of our CV evolutionary calculations,\na preliminary subset of which has been used by Beuermann\net al. 1998. We discuss implications of the need for both\nhigh mass transfer rates and a significant fraction of systems\nwith nuclearly evolved donors. We focus on CVs where the\nspectral type can be determined fairly accurately, i.e. on\nsystems with orbital period above 3 h. In a previous paper\n(Kolb and Baraffe 1999), we considered aspects specific to\nthe evolution of systems below the period gap (P \u2264 2 h).\nIn \u00a72 we summarize the input physics and present evolutionary sequences with initial ZAMS donors. Nuclearly\nevolved sequences are presented in \u00a73. A discussion and conclusions follow in \u00a74.\n\n2\n\nEVOLUTIONARY MODELS WITH INITIAL\nZAMS DONOR\n\nA brief description of the input physics for our stellar code\ncan be found in Kolb and Baraffe (1999) and Baraffe et\nal. (1998). More details are given by Chabrier and Baraffe\n(1997) for the interior physics and by Hauschildt et al. (1999)\nfor the atmosphere models. Here we just recall the main\nimprovements compared to earlier models applied to CV\ndonors: (i) the new models are based on the equation of state\n(EOS) of Saumon et al. (1995) which is specially devoted to\nlow\u2013mass stars and brown dwarfs, and to the description\nof strong non\u2013ideal effects characterizing the interior stellar plasma; (ii) the outer boundary condition is based on\nnon-grey atmosphere models (the use of a grey boundary\ncondition overestimates the effective temperature Teff and\nluminosity L for a given mass M ); (iii) mass\u2013colour and\nmass\u2013magnitude relations are derived self\u2013consistently from\nthe synthetic spectra of the same atmosphere models which\nprovide the boundary condition.\nWe use the empirical SpT \u2013 (I \u2212 K) relation estab-\n\nlished by Beuermann et al. (1998) to determine the spectral\ntype SpT for a given model (M , Teff , L) from the calculated\ncolour I \u2212 K. The accuracy and relevance of this conversion\nis discussed in Beuermann et al. (1998).\nBecause of the uncertainty of current descriptions for\norbital angular momentum losses by magnetic braking and\nthe substantial computer time (cf. Kolb and Ritter, 1990;\nHameury 1991) required for evolutionary sequences if mass\ntransfer is treated explicitly and self\u2013consistently, we restrict our analysis to sequences calculated with constant\nmass transfer rate. We have checked that sequences with\nmass transfer driven by angular momentum losses J \u0307 with\neither constant J \u0307, constant J \u0307/J, or J \u0307 according to Verbunt\n& Zwaan (1981), have the same main properties as the sequences with constant \u1e40 on which we base our conclusions.\nIn this section we consider sequences where mass transfer starts with donors of mass M2 = 1M\u2299 that are initially on the ZAMS, with solar composition (X = 0.70,\nZ=0.02). We define a \"standard sequence\" which reproduces\nthe width and location of the period gap (2.1 - 3.2 h) in the\nframework of the disrupted magnetic braking model. This\nsequence is calculated with \u1e40 = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 until the donor becomes fully convective at M2 = 0.21 M\u2299\nand P = 3.2 h. At this point mass transfer ceases and the\nsecondary shrinks back to its thermal equilibrium configuration in 2 \u2212 3 \u00d7 108 years. Mass transfer resumes when the\nRoche lobe radius catches up with the donor radius at a\nperiod P = 2.1 h. The transfer rate in this second phase is\n5\u00d710\u221211 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , a value typical for systems driven by gravitational wave emission (cf. Kolb and Baraffe 1999). This\nstandard sequence is shown in Fig. 1 (thick solid line), together with sequences calculated with higher transfer rates\n(3 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ).\nMass\u2013losing stars deviate from thermal equilibrium.\nThe deviation is large if the secondary's thermal timescale\ntKH \u223c GM 2 /RL is long compared to the mass transfer\ntimescale tM = M/(\u2212\u1e40 ). As shown in Fig. 2a, mass transfer causes a contraction of the donor radius (e.g. Whyte\nand Eggleton 1980; Stehle et al. 1996) relative to the corresponding ZAMS radius for predominantly radiative objects\nM >\n\u223c 0.6M\u2299 , where the radiative core exceeds 80% of the\ntotal mass (cf. Chabrier and Baraffe 1997, their Fig. 9). Predominantly convective stars (M <\n\u223c 0.6M\u2299 ) expand relative\nto the ZAMS. Although a large mass transfer rate causes\na significant departure of R from its equilibrium value (see\nFig. 2a), Fig. 2b shows that Teff is rather insensitive to \u1e40\n(see also Singer et al. 1993; Kolb et al. 2000).\nThe outer boundary condition of the stellar model is\nmore important than \u1e40 for the determination of Teff , as indicated by the dotted curve in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2b. This curve\ncorresponds to a sequence with \u1e40 = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ,\nbut calculated with the Eddington approximation, which\nimplicitly assumes greyness and the diffusion approximation for radiative transfer in the atmosphere.

Note that the Eddington approximation sequence reproduces the period gap as\nwell as the corresponding non-grey sequence, with a width\nand location of 2.2 - 3 h.

This example highlights the significant\nimprovements of our new generation of low\u2013mass star models.\nNote that the period Pturn where the period derivative\nchanges from negative to positive due to departure from\nthermal equilibrium increases with mass transfer rate. Remarkably, the standard sequence reaches period bounce at\nP = 3.2 h, the same period where the secondary star becomes fully convective. Sequences with higher mass transfer\nrate bounce before the donor becomes fully convective.

It\nis well known that such a spread of \u1e40 in systems above\nthe period gap cannot be excluded by observations (cf. e.g.\nWarner 1995, his Fig. 9.8; Sproats et al. 1996).\nAlthough the sharp observed gap boundaries seem to\nimply uniform values of the secular mean \u1e40 near the upper\n\n\f4\n\nI.

The sharp upper edge is\npreserved if disrupted magnetic braking holds and \u1e40 adopts\nonly values \u2265 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . With increasing \u1e40 the\ncritical mass where the secondary becomes fully convective\nbecomes smaller (cf. Fig. 2a). Thus, if the system detaches\nat this point, by analogy with the disrupted magnetic braking model, mass transfer resumes after the secondary has\nreached thermal equilibrium at a period shorter than 2 h.\nAs an example, for the sequence with \u1e40 = 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121\nthe donor becomes fully convective at M2 \u223c 0.15M\u2299 , and\nthe system reappears as CV at P \u223c 1.7 h. Test calculations\nwith a population synthesis code (e.g. Kolb 1993) show that\nsuch a spread of systems reappearing below the gap still\ngives a reasonably sharp lower edge of the period gap, with\nonly a mild over\u2013accumulation of systems in a period interval 1.7 \u2212 2.1 h. This is perfectly consistent with the observed\ndistribution which does show a slight, although statistically\nprobably not significant, accumulation of systems there.\nDespite this consistency, accepting the \u1e40 spread is not\nan attractive solution to the late SpT problem. It is hard to\nsee why a presumably global angular momentum loss mechanism should drive such different transfer rates in otherwise\nsimilar systems.\nFinally we note that there are no CV secondaries above\nthe ZAMS line in the P \u2212SpT diagram for periods longer\nthan \u223c 6 h. This suggests that in these systems the secular\nmean \u1e40 must be smaller than 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . But whatever\nthe value of \u1e40 , sequences with unevolved donors never drop\nbelow the ZAMS line for P >\n\u223c 6 h.\n\n3\n\nEVOLVED SEQUENCES\n\nWe now consider sequences with initial donors which have\nevolved off the ZAMS prior to mass transfer. When mass\ntransfer turns on, the star is old enough (cf. Table 1) to have\nburned a substantial amount of hydrogen in the centre. Only\nstars with mass M > 0.35M\u2299 , which develop a radiative core\n(cf. Chabrier and Baraffe 1997), start to deplete central H\nwithin a Hubble time. But only if M > 0.8M\u2299 is more than\n50% of the initial H depleted in less than 10 Gyr. Therefore,\nthis donor type is restricted to systems that form with a\nfairly massive secondary >\n\u223c 1M\u2299 .\nFigure 3 depicts sequences with such nuclearly evolved\ndonors - hereafter \"evolved sequences\" - in the P \u2013SpT\ndiagram, for different central H mass fractions Xc at the time\nmass transfer starts. The initial secondary mass is M2 =\n\n1M\u2299 or M2 = 1.2M\u2299 and mass transfer rate is fixed to\n1.5 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Table 2 gives for each of these sequences\nthe secondary mass M , spectral type, Teff and radius R as a\nfunction of P , for 3 \u2264 P/h \u2264 10. The evolutionary track of\nZAMS donor sequences in the P \u2013SpT diagram is insensitive\nto the initial donor mass, while for evolved sequences with\nthe same initial Xc Teff decreases (the spectral type becomes\nlater) at a given P with increasing initial donor mass. This\nis illustrated in Fig. 3 where we plot sequences starting with\nM2 = 1M\u2299 (long\u2013dashed curve) and M2 = 1.2M\u2299 (dash\u2013\ndotted curve), both for Xc = 0.05.\nAs already emphasized by Beuermann et al. (1998),\nevolved sequences result in later spectral types for a given\nP >\n\u223c 5 h than the standard sequence and can explain amazingly well the spread of data observed above 6 h. The reason\nfor this is illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, which display several diagnostic quantities along the sequences as a function\nof secondary mass (Fig. 4) and orbital period (Fig. 5).\nWhen mass transfer turns on, more evolved donors with\nsmaller Xc have larger R, Teff and Tc than less evolved\ndonors. This follows from the well known properties of the\nH burning phase of solar\u2013type stars with a central radiative\ncore: as hydrogen is depleted in the centre, the increase of the\ncentral molecular weight \u03bc yields an increase of the central\ntemperature and thus L, causing an expansion of the star.\nHence the main\u2013sequence evolution of a star with constant\nmass proceeds towards larger L and Teff . The same effect exists for mass\u2013losing main\u2013sequence stars. Consequently, for\na given mass, R is larger for more evolved sequences, and P\nis longer, while for a given P , the secondary mass and Teff\nis smaller, hence the spectral type is later (cf. Fig. 3). As a\nconsequence, the donor mass at any given P is smallest for\nthe most evolved sequence, cf. Table 2.\nAlthough the evolved sequences shown in Fig 3 provide\nan attractive explanation for the observed data above 5-6\nh, they are obviously in conflict with the standard explanation of the period gap. Indeed, with the adopted value\n\u1e40 = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 we find that these sequences enter the period gap before the donor becomes fully convective or before the system bounces due to departure from\nthermal equilibrium. Table 1 gives the mass of the secondary and the mass Mcore of its radiative core at P =\n3 h for the different sequences. Period bounce occurs for the\n(M2 = 1M\u2299 , Xc = 0.16) sequence at P = 2.60 h, corresponding to M = 0.1M\u2299 and Mcore = 0.04M\u2299 . The donor\nbecomes fully convective only at M \u223c 0.05M\u2299 (P = 2.9 h).\nFor more evolved sequences, period bounce would occur at\neven smaller periods.\nThis difference in the size of the radiative core is caused\nby the small central H abundance. The smaller Xc and the\nhigher central temperature of evolved donors compared to\nunevolved donors (cf. Figs. 4 and 5) imply lower radiative\nopacities in the central region, and consequently favour radiative transport. As a result, the inward progression of the\nbottom of the donor's convective envelope as mass decreases\nproceeds at a slower rate. Hence in evolved sequences the\ndonor has a larger radiative core Mcore than a donor with\nthe same mass in an unevolved sequence (see Fig. 4). In\nterms of P , Fig. 5 shows that Mcore is larger for the standard sequence at any given P >\n\u223c 3.5 h. The situation then\nreverses at the upper edge of the gap, which corresponds to\nMcore = 0 for the standard sequence.

(a) Mass \u2013 radius relation for ZAMS stars and for unevolved CV donors in sequences with constant mass transfer rate.\nLinestyle as in Fig. 1. (b) Mass \u2013 Teff relation for the same models as in (a).\n\ncentral H abundance described above is similar to that reported by Laughlin et al. (1997) who followed the central\nH burning phase of very low\u2013mass stars with M \u2264 0.25M\u2299\n(with constant mass). They note that stars which are fully\nconvective on the ZAMS develop a radiative core towards\nthe end of the main sequence because of the depletion of H\nand subsequent lowering of the central radiative opacities.\nThe P \u2013SpT diagram suggests that at long orbital periods a fairly large fraction of systems has a significantly\nevolved donor. If these carried on evolving with a transfer rate \u2243 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 they would clearly overpopulate the period gap regime. This is made worse by the\nfact that some of these sequences reach their minimum period in the period gap (Fig. 3): at period bounce \u1e56 = 0,\nand the detection probability d \u221d 1/\u1e56 increases sharply.\nWe find a similar behaviour if mass transfer is treated self\u2013\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nconsistently, with an angular momentum loss rate J \u0307 = const.\nor J \u0307 \u221d J, calibrated such that the corresponding unevolved sequence reproduces the observed period gap (giving\n\u1e40 = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 at P \u223c 3 h).\nAn obvious way to prevent evolved sequences from\nevolving into the period gap region is to increase the mass\ntransfer rate. This increases the deviation from thermal equilibrium and leads to period bounce above the upper edge\nof the observed gap. Test calculations with constant mass\ntransfer rate show that period bounce occurs at P > 3 h\nwith \u1e40 \u2265 3 \u00d7 10\u22129 and 5 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for sequences\nwith respectively Xc = 0.16 and 0.05, for initial donor mass\n1M\u2299 . The same behavior is found for donors with higher\ninitial mass. In other words, for sequences with smaller Xc a\nhigher \u1e40 near the upper edge of the period gap is required\nthan for less evolved donors, consistent with the fact that\n\n\f6\n\nI. Baraffe, U.

The data are the same as in Fig. 1.\n\nthe thermal time is shorter if Xc is small. These evolved sequences with high transfer rates (\u1e40 > 5 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 )\nalso match the observed spectral types in the region P =\n3-6 h, just as high \u1e40 sequences with ZAMS donors do (see\n\u00a72 and Fig. 1).\n> 5 h a higher\nNote however, that for long periods P \u223c\n\u1e40 has the same effect as for the unevolved sequences discussed in \u00a72 (Fig. 1). The effective temperature is larger and\ntherefore the spectral type earlier than for a sequence with\nsmaller \u1e40 . Thus in order to account for the full range of\nrather cool spectral types at long periods, \u1e40 cannot always\nbe high along all evolved sequences.\nTo summarize: evolved sequences require high \u1e40 (>\n\u223c\n5 \u00d7 10\u22129 ) near the upper gap region to avoid crossing the\n\n\u22129\ngap, but a low mass transfer rate (\u1e40 <\n\u223c6\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10 ) for P >\nh to explain the late spectral type CVs in this region. This\nsuggests that the mean mass transfer rate increases during\nthe secular evolution of nuclear evolved donors.\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe performed calculations of the long\u2013term evolution of\nCVs with up\u2013to\u2013date stellar models that fit observed properties of single low\u2013mass stars exceptionally well.

The\ndonor becomes fully convective at a mass smaller than the\ncanonical 0.21M\u2299 of the standard (unevolved) sequence, but\nat a period longer than 3 h. If the system detaches at this\npoint and the donor can re\u2013establish thermal equilibrium,\nthen mass transfer would resume at a period well below 2 h.\nThis guarantees consistency with the standard discontinuous orbital braking model.\nPoints (ii) to (iv) show that if the mass transfer rate\nincreases significantly along the secular evolution of evolved\n\ndonors, these sequences can explain the observed scatter in\nthe P \u2212SpT diagram both above 6 h, through the effect a\nlower Xc has on the evolutionary track (see \u00a73 and Fig. 3),\nand below 6 h, through the effect of a higher \u1e40 (see \u00a72 and\nFig. 1).\nA large range of the secular mean mass transfer rate, as\nsuggested by (ii), could be reconciled with the sharp boundaries of the observed period gap. In the standard model\nthese are a result of the dominance of sequences with the\ncanonical value 1 \u2212 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 at periods close to 3 h.\nThe apparent scatter of data in the P -SpT diagram does\nnot support this dominance. Reasonably sharp boundaries\ncould be maintained if the canonical value is the minimum\n\u1e40 value of the range of transfer rates. The observed gap\nedges would then be defined by this minimum mass transfer rate sequence. Sequences with higher \u1e40 would bounce\nbefore they reach the upper edge of the gap. They detach\nat longer periods and reattach at shorter periods than the\nstandard sequence.\nA more serious problem is that the large \u1e40 range for\notherwise similar system parameters, as suggested by (ii) for\nunevolved sequences, leaves the nature of the main control\nparameter determining the strength of orbital angular momentum losses completely undetermined. Our experiments\nshow that Xc could be this parameter.\nThe full observed range of data in the P -SpT diagram\ncould be explained if the orbital braking strength increases\nboth with decreasing P and decreasing Xc . This ensures that\nperiod bounce prevents evolved sequences from overpopulating the period gap, while they still pass through rather late\nspectral types at long periods. The resulting J \u0307 law must give\nthe canonical value of \u1e40 at 3 h for Xc = 0.7. A large \u1e40\nrange for unevolved systems is not required.\nWith standard magnetic braking laws (e.g. by Verbunt\n& Zwaan 1981, Mestel & Spruit 1987) the transfer rate\nusually increases with period, and is smaller for sequences\nwith more evolved donors (see e.g. Pylyser & Savonije 1989,\nSinger et al. 1993, Ritter 1994), i.e. has just the opposite\ndifferential behaviour than the one we propose. Given the\nsignificant uncertainty in these magnetic braking models\nand our poor knowledge of the underlying stellar magnetic\ndynamo, the suggestion that observations favour a non\u2013\nstandard law does not appear unrealistic. Further considerations of the theory of magnetic braking to assess our finding\nare clearly beyond the scope of this paper. We note, however,\nthat there are magnetic braking scenarios in the literature\nthat lead to an increase of \u1e40 with progressing evolution.\nKolb & Ritter (1992) obtained this for a Verbunt & Zwaan\n(1981)\u2013type law when only the donor's convective envelope\nis coupled to the orbital motion. Zangrilli et al. (1997) found\nthis property for their boundary\u2013layer dynamo.\nAt this point we re\u2013emphasize that the input physics on\nwhich our stellar models are based provides an excellent description of observed properties of isolated low\u2013mass stars.\nUnless there are effects peculiar to CV secondaries that are\nnot taken into account by the models (e.g., effects due to\nthe rapid rotation, or the irradiation by the white dwarf\nand accretion disc), one is forced to accept that a large fraction of CVs have a nuclearly evolved donor star. This is\nin stark contrast to predictions of standard models for the\nformation of CVs, where most CVs form with a secondary\nwhich is too low\u2013mass (<\n\u223c 0.6M\u2299 ) to be evolved (Politano\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fOn the late spectral types of cataclysmic variable secondaries\n1996, King et al. 1994). But this predominance of unevolved\ndonors is mainly due to the neglect of systems forming with\na secondary that is significantly more massive than the white\ndwarf (Ritter 2000). These undergo thermal\u2013timescale mass\n\u22127\n\u22121\ntransfer at a rate >\nand are usually associ\u223c 10 M\u2299 yr\nated with supersoft sources (e.g. di Stefano and Rappaport\n1994). It is perfectly possible that these systems reappear\nas standard CVs once the mass ratio (q = donor mass/WD\nmass) is sufficiently small. In descendants of this thermal\u2013\ntimescale evolution any degree of nuclear evolution prior to\nmass transfer is possible. De Kool (1992) finds that the impact of these survivor systems depends on the assumed initial mass ratio distribution which ultimately determines the\nsecondary mass distribution in post\u2013common envelope binaries. For de Kool's model 1 (dN \u221ddq) survivor systems completely dominate the CV population. A full appraisal of the\nviability of the apparent predominance of nuclear evolved\nsystems is beyond the scope of our study. This requires a\nfull population synthesis with self\u2013consistent treatment of\nXc \u2013dependent angular momentum losses.\nFinally, the accurate determination of donor masses\ncould provide an observational test of our hypothesis that a\nsignificant fraction of CV donors is nuclearly evolved. Observational errors are still too large (e.g. Smith & Dhillon\n1998) for this test. Systems with the most discrepant (late)\nspectral type should have the smallest mass at any given P .\nAcknowledgments We are grateful to K. Beuermann,\nH. Ritter, H. Spruit, F. and E.
