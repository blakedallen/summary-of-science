In this paper we use QCD-inspired potential\nmodels, though without resorting to any particular one, to calculate level spacings of bound states\nand decay rates of the aforementioned exotic matter in order to design discovery strategies. We\nmainly focus on quirky matter, but our conclusions can be extended to other similar scenarios.\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSince the beginning of accelerator physics, mass spectroscopy has been playing a leading\nrole in the discovery of particle and resonance states, and understanding of the fundamental\ninteractions in the Standard Model (SM). For example, the first signals of charm and bottom\nquarks were in fact detected through the formation of J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 bound states.\nOn the other hand, current colliders like the LHC, or the ILC in a farther future, will\nlikely continue this discovery program beyond the SM. It is conceivable that new (super)\nheavy bound states can be formed and, contrary to e.g. the toponium system, their basic\nconstituents are prevented from decaying before the binding is effective. The goal of this\npaper is to perfom a prospective study of the spectroscopy of such exotic massive states,\nby making several reasonable assumptions about the interacting potential among the newphysics constituents which may differ from standard QCD. Furthermore, we will estimate\nleptonic decay widths of very heavy bound states by making specific assumptions on the\nquantum numbers of constituents, although not in a comprehensive way.\n\nA.\n\nExotic scenarios\n\nDuring the last years, minimal extensions of the SM containing additional heavy particles\ncharged under a new unbroken non-Abelian gauge group Gv with fermions Q,Q\u0304 have been\nproposed under the general name of \"hidden valley\" models [1], which is a very general\nscenario containing such heavy particles but as well new sectors of lightweight particles to\nbe observed. In these models all SM particles would be neutral under such the new Gv\ngroup, while new particles charged under Gv but neutral under the SM group would show\nup if large energy scales are probed. Higher dimension operators, induced e.g. by a Z \u2032 or a\nloop involving heavy particles carrying both GSM and Gv charges, should connect both SM\nand new physics sectors through rather weak interactions.\nIn particular, if the Gv group corresponds to SU(3), the fermions in the fundamental\nrepresentation have been recently named as \"quirks\" [2] or iquarks [3]. [4] Actually this\ntheory can be viewed as a certain limit of QCD where light quarks are removed and the\ntypical scale \u039b where the new interaction becomes strong is much smaller than the heavy\n\n2\n\n\fflavor masses. More generally, such kind of scenario can be put in correspondence with a\nclass of \"hidden valley\" models as pointed out in [1]. In these models, quirks are defined to\nbe new massive fermions transforming under both GSM and a general ( not only SU(3) )\nnon-abelian gauge group Gv .\nIt has been considered so far in the literature that \u039b is smaller than \u039bQCD , but as well\nthe particular case of hidden valleys with quirks in which \u039b is greater than \u039bQCD has been\nstudied in the literature [1],[6],[7]. The name of infracolour is used to design of the new\ngluonic degrees of freedom when \u039b is much smaller than the quirk mass; in this work we\nwill refer to it as i-colour (i-QCD) in correspondence with the name quirk.\n\nB.\n\nExotic long-lived bound states\n\nIn this section we will focus on the bound states of quirks. The phenomenology of such\nbound states has first studied in [2], and later an analysis on the spectroscopy of these\nsystems was done by the authors of [8].\n\nIt is well-known that the large mass of the top quark in the SM prevents toponium to be\nformed since the constituents quarks would decay away too fast. A criterion for existence\nof such bound states is that the binding energy should be larger than the total decay\nwidth. For heavy onia states beyond the SM, however, the situation could be different.\nIn particular, in the case of quirks [2],[5],[8], its decay is prevented from the conservation\nof a quantum number. Regarding the dynamics of these quirks, according to [2], one can\ndistinguish among three possible energy scales: the first one is the 100 eV . \u039b . keV\nrange, where the quirk strings are macroscopic; the mesoscopic strings can be find at the\nrange keV . \u039b . MeV (which is large compared to the atomic scales); and finally we\nfind the microscopic scale at MeV . \u039b . mQ .\nOn the other hand, assuming that the scale of i-colour is below the weak scale, bound\nstates of the new sector are kinematically accessible to present and future collider experiments. However, since the SM particles are uncharged under i-colour, (quirk) loops would\nbe required to couple both sectors leading to highly supressed production rates. Moreover,\n3\n\n\ffrom reference [2], quirks are defined to be charged under (some) gauge groups of the SM\n(for example, charged under the electroweak interaction) quirks could be pair produced\nthrough electroweak processes.\nLikewise, in Ref.[3] quirks are considered as vectors with respect to the electroweak\ngauge group without carrying QCD colour, but carrying i-colour charge.\n\nTherefore\n\nnotice that there is no Yukawa coupling between the Higgs boson and quirks. Thus we\ndiscard the possible binding force which has been postulated for ultraheavy quarkonium\ntaking over gluon-exchange. At this point, for the sake of clarity, it must be stressed that,\ntaking simple assumptions, through this work we will focus on the case of uncoloured quirks.\n\nIn this scenario, quirks can be copiously pair-produced at the LHC not through QCD\ninteractions but via electromagnetic and electroweak interactions. As quirks would be\nlong-lived particles as compared to the collider/detection time scale, different detection\nstrategies can be undertaken according to the possible aforementioned micro, meso or\nmacroscopic regimes.\n\nFinally, notice that possible quirky signals of folded supersymmetry in colliders have been\nstudied in [9], focusing on the scalar quirks (squirks). Contrary to usual supersymmetric\npartners of quarks, squirks (choosing a simple scenario) are expected to be uncolored, but\ninstead charged under a new confining group, equivalent to i-QCD as introduced above.\nThe study of spectroscopy performed in this paper is actually not sensitive to possible scalar\nnature of new fermions, and the main lines could be applicable to squirkonium as well.\n\nC.\n\nExotic phenomenology\n\nAccording to [7], when the quirk pair is produced an excited bound state can be formed\nwith invariant mass given approximately by the total center of momentum energy of the\nhard partonic scattering giving raise to the pair. In the microscopic regime this bound\nstate would loose energy by emitting i-glueballs and bremsstrahlung towards low-lying\nstates. Once they loose most of their kinetic energy these bound states (to be dubbed\n4\n\n\fQuirkonium) could decay via electroweak interaction. However, it is also possible other\nscenario in which the neutral and colourless quirk pair might have a prompt annihilation\nbefore they can loose energy enough to form the low lying quirkonium state. However,\ndue to the non perturvative nature of the mechanisms it is difficult to estimate in advance\nthe proportion of the events falling in each scenario,and therefore the possibility to\ndetect these low lying states can not be discarded. Through this work, in particular we\nwill focus on neutral bound states which can decay, e.g. to final-state dileptons, providing a clean signature even admits a huge hadronic background as at the LHC experiments.\n\nNew particles with a mass of up to several hundred GeV can be pair copiously produced\nat the LHC. One expects that quirks will be in general produced with kinetic energy quite\nlarger than \u039b. A significant fraction of this energy should be lost by emission of photons\nand i-glueballs prior to pair-annihilation.\nThe two quirks will fly off back-to-back, developing a i-QCD string or flux tube. In usual\nQCD with light matter the string is broken up promptly by creating light quark-antiquark\npair; in i-QCD this mechanism is practically absent. The two heavy ends of the string would\ncontinue to move apart, eventually stopping once all the kinetic energy was stored in the\nstring. The quirks would be then pulled together by the string beginning an oscillatory\nmotion.\nMost examples of late-decaying particles that have been addressed in the literature yield\nmissing energy, while quirks would annihilate into visible energy in most modes. Besides,\nas explained in [2] and [5], only i-colour singlet states could be observed.\nAs commented before, in a optimistic scenario, the excited bound state will emit\ni-glueballs and bremsstrahlung, towards low-lying states; then they would annihilate into a\nhard final state: di-lepton, di-jet, or di-photon.\n\nIf we want to investigate whether or not it is possible to disentangle different state levels\nunder the assumption of a given (large) quirk mass and a specific form of new i-colour\ninteraction, then we could focus on a dimuon signal from the annihilation of a narrow\nresonance, since it is the most promising channel [7]; it then becomes crucial if the level\nspacing of different S-wave states is enough to the foreseen mass resolution based on invariant\nmass reconstruction from a dimuon system.\n5\n\n\fAccording to the reference [7] the detection of bound states at hadron colliders is reliable\nbecause the signal production is strong and peaked in invariant mass, and the dominant\nbackground is electroweak and diffuse. On the other hand, dimuon backgrounds from\nsources other than Drell-Yan can be suppressed by requiring no extra hard jets or missing\nenergy. Besides, at the LHC, trigger and detector efficiencies are expected to be very high\nfor high-mass dimuon events.\nConcerning other channels, it is expected that Quirkonium annihilation into a electron\npair could be also a useful signal since the invariant mass peak is expected to yield a similar\npeak to dimuon but smaller and wider due to detector effects.\nOn the other hand, in the squirkonium case, according to the reference [10] the radiative\ndecay (by soft radiation) from the highly excited states to the ground state can be ultimately\ndetected by means of unclustered soft fotons in the uncolored case. Also, in ref. [9] it is\npointed out the possibility to use the invariant mass peak of W +photon, since this channel\ndominates the squirkonium annhilation at or near the ground state. If necessary, all these\nsignals could aid to distinguish among different states.\n\nFocusing again on the dimuon signal, as it can be seen from ATLAS and CMS reports\n[11],[12] one can consider a 2% accuracy for the transverse momentum of muons even at high\nmomentum. Since the dimuon invariant mass should coincide to a good approximation, for\nsmall (pseudo)rapidities, with the transverse momentum error, \u03b4(M\u03bc\u03bc ) \u2243 0.02 \u00d7 MQQ\u0304\n(since pt \u2243 MQQ\u0304 /2); letting MQQ\u0304 vary along the range [100, 1000] GeV, the mass resolution\nshould roughly take the values along the interval [2, 20] GeV.\n\nD.\n\nModel settings\n\nHereafter we restrict our analysis to the range of \u039b given by \u039b << mQ but in the\nmicroscopic regime, namely\nfew MeV . \u039b . few GeV\n\n(1)\n\nAs is well-known long ago, a non-relativistic treatment of the potential for conventional\n6\n\n\fheavy quarkonium has proved to be suitable on account of the asymptotic freedom of QCD.\nMoreover, one distinguishes between short- and long-distance dynamics of constituents in\nthe bound state leading to an effective (static) potential of the type:\nV (r) = VS (r) + VL (r)\n\n(2)\n\nIn particular we will write\nV (r) = \u2212\n\nA\n+ B r\u03bd\nr\u03bc\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the first term with \u03bc = 1 would correspond to a Coulombic interaction, and the\nsecond one with \u03bd = 1 to a linear confining interaction.\nIn this work we will consider firstly a Coulomb plus Linear potential (CpL) with \u03bc = 1\nand \u03bd = 1; later we will use a more general Coulomb plus Power Law potential (CpP)\nwith \u03bc = 1 and \u03bd = 0.5, 1.5 as tentative possibilities. The motivation for the insertion of\nthese power law potentials comes up from the clasical studies of Quarkonia (see Refs. [13],\n[14], [15].) in which are considered Coulomb like, linear and Cornell potentials, but as well\nthe power law potentials are taken into account in order to cover possible deviations from\nthem. In this way and focusing on the case of Quirkonium, in reference [2] a pure linear\npotential is taken into account, in reference [8] a Coulomb-like potential were considered.\nTherefore tracking the same philosophy than in the Quarkonia case possible deviations are\nalso considered within this study.\nMoreover, the interaction accounting for the above static potential can be parameterized\nby the fermion (quirk) mass mQ , where 100 GeV . mQ . TeV and an additional SU(NIC )\ngauge coupling (NIC stands for the i-colour number) which can be related with a i-colour\nscale \u039b.\nIn this work we will specify V (r) in Eq.(3) as\nV (r) = \u03c3 r \u03bd \u2212\n\nC \u03b1\u2032\nr\n\n(4)\n\nto be interpreted as CpL (\u03bd = 1) and CpP (\u03bd = 0.5, 1.5) potentials. Here \u03c3 corresponds\nto the i-color string tension and we have introduced a i-color coupling \u03b1\u2032 , alongside a\ngroup theory factor C, in close analogy to QCD potential models; hence, making a simple\nassumption, such group factor is taken as a mirror from QCD potentials (C = 4/3) and\nincluded into the infracolour coupling: i.e., in calculations we set \u03b1Icolour = C\u03b1\u2032 . Of course,\nother numerical choices for C can be done, but \u03b1\u2032 depends on the \u039b scale which is actually\n7\n\n\funcertain as we shall discuss later.\n\nOn the other hand, in analogy to conventional QCD-inspired potential models, the icolour string tension can be interpreted as a linear energy density (E/L), where E \u223c \u039b and\n\nL \u223c \u039b\u22121 . Hence the relation \u03c3 \u223c \u039b2 is expected to remain (approximately) valid, likewise\n\nthe equivalent QCD expression \u03c3s \u223c \u039b2QCD (also derived from lattice calculations [16]), and\nfinally\n\n\u03c3\u221d\n\n\u0014\n\n\u039b\n\u039bQCD\n\n\u00152\n\n(5)\n\n\u03c3s\n\nIn other words, a proportionality depending on the respective \u039b and \u039bQCD between both\nstring tensions could be expected from the above arguments. Basically, Eq.(5) implies that \u03c3\nand \u039b parameters are not independent of each other. For the sake of simplicity, the unknown\nproportionality factor will be set equal to unity, so that by fixing \u039b one gets \u03c3 (for given\n\u039bQCD and \u03c3s values).\nFocusing on the \u039b scale, in this work in principle it corresponds to the microscopic\n\u039b\u2032 scale depicted in Ref.[3]. Numerically speaking, as it will be seen, the values of \u039b\nwere taken below and above of the QCD scale in a bandwidth; i.e. \u039b = k\u039bQCD with\nk = (0.1, 0.4, 1, 10) to take into account the uncertainity about this quantity. In this\nway, the equation(5) can be regarded as a comparison between the strength of the linear\npotential in both sectors SU(3)QCD and the new gauge group SU(3)Icolour , and it is\nintended to be an ansatz or a hint to determine numerically a proportionality between \u03c3s\nand \u03c3, in which subsequently the numerical uncertainity about the proportionality factor\nis diluted, taking into account the lack of knowledge about \u039b. Besides, this comparison\nbetween diferent theories can be viewed to some extent in a similar way than in classical physics, in which the strength of gravitational and the electrostatic forces are compared.\nConcerning the i-colour coupling constant, \u03b1\u2032, it would be related with \u039b; as we are\ndealing with a non-Abelian i-colour binding force it implies \u03b1\u2032 is scale dependent. We will\ncompute \u03b1\u2032 value at the running scale Q = 2mQ according to [3]:\n12 \u03c0\n\n\u03b1\u2032 (Q) =\n\n(11 NIC \u2212 2nQ ) ln\n8\n\n\u0012\n\nQ2\n\u039b2\n\n\u0013\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhere NIC is the i-colour number, and nQ the number of quirk generation at the running\nscale. From Eq.(5) and Eq.(6), one can see that both parameters \u03c3 and \u03b1\u2032 are depending\non \u039b, so that they are not independent quantities. Nonetheless, all those constraints have\nto be taken with a grain of salt and one should consider as well values deviating from those\ngiven in Eqs. (5 - 6), as we will see later.\nIn case of more quirk generations, additional active quirk should be taken into account at\ndifferent energy scale thresholds. Nevertheless, for the sake of simplicity, and in view of still\nmany unknowns in the different models, we will assume NIC = 3 and nQ = 1 throughout\nthis work.\nAs previously mentioned, we consider that the quirk mass lies in the range 100 GeV .\nmQ . TeV. Therefore one can reasonably expect that the bound system indeed meets a\ntruly non-relativistic regime, i.e. the relative quirk velocity v in the center of mass frame\nbeing substantially smaller than the value for bottomonium (v 2 \u2243 10\u22121 ). Focusing on\nquirkonium, a formal derivation of such non-relativistic limit from the relativistic degrees of\nfreedom can be found in [8]; besides according to Reference [2] and [10], the bound state is\nformed in a highly excited state then it decays to the lower states loosing the main part of\nits kinetic energy. Therefore it is expected that in the lower levels near to the ground state\nthis kinetic energy could be low enough to assume a non-relativistic aproximation. Also, as\nwe shall see later, the numerical results obtained for the expected quirk velocity < v 2 > in\nthe CoM frame justify this approximation.\n\nII.\n\nPROSPECTIVE SPECTROSCOPY OF EXOTIC STATES\n\nSince we are interested to perform spectroscopy for very heavy non-relativistic bound\nstates, the Schr\u00f6dinger radial equation must be solved: in a analytical way it could be done\nby means of a expansion of the quirkonium wave function in a complete basis; nevertheless\nhere we will choose to solve it numerically, and therefore one should expect that the method\nto get the resulting mass spectroscopy followed in the QQ-onia package [17] based on the\nresolution of the Schr\u00f6dinger radial equation using the Numerov 0(h6 ) technique, should\nwork appropriately for our analysis of Quirkonium. However, we are confronted here to the\nlack of experimental data to set the ground state of quirkonium, in sharp contrast with,\n9\n\n\fe.g., the bottomonium or charmonium systems. Nevertheless, let us stress that in this work\nwe are here mainly interested in estimating the mass spacing between different state levels\nrather than their absolute values.\nAs commented in the Introduction, new interactions and particles can form very massive\nbound states. In this section we show the results for quirk (QQ\u0304) bound state system by\nsweeping through the scale range, f ew MeV . \u039b . f ew GeV characterizing the i-colour\nforce.\nFirst we will look at the results using a Coulomb plus Linear potential (CpL) (with\n\u03bc = 1 and \u03bd = 1); later using a Coulomb plus Power Law potential (CpP) (with \u03bc = 1\nand \u03bd = 0.5, 1.5). Concerning the quirk mass, first we use mQ = 100 GeV, and later\nmQ = 500 GeV as representative values (nevertheless in some calculations we will take\nadditional values). The energy levels, En shown in Tables correspond to Mnl = 2mQ + Enl\nwhere Mnl (or M) is the quirkonium mass level. In all cases, we set the ground state to\nbe E1S = 0. Besides as relevant calculations we will display also the squared radial wave\nfunction at the origin (WFO) (or their derivatives), the size of each quirkonium level, and\nthe mean value of the relative quirk velocity v in their center of mass frame, since it is\nused in some calculations [2]; besides, the obtained velocities will check the non-relativistic\napproximation.\n\n10\n\n\fA.\n\nCpL potential\n\nLet us start by considering the CpL potential. All Tables cited in this and successive\nsections can be found in Appendix.\n\n1.\n\nmQ = 100 GeV\n\nResults for the quirkonium spectrum with mQ = 100 GeV and \u039b = 0.1 \u039bQCD = 25\nMeV are shown in Table I. The corresponding parameters are \u03c3 = 0.0018 GeV2 and\n\u03b1\u2032 (Q = 2mQ ) = 0.068. Concerning the mean radius, for the ground state we find a size\nsimilar to the Bohr radius rB \u223c (m\u03b1\u2032 )\u22121 , and increases for higher states as expected up\nto \u223c 1f m; moreover, with these parameters we can found (8S) states with sizes beyond\n\n2f m, which is in accordance with \u223c \u039b\u22121 . The quirk velocity in the CoM frame hv 2 i \u2248 10\u22124\n\nslowly increasing with the n and l quantum numbers; these low v values plainly justify the\nnon relativistic regime resulting from the QQ-onia package.\n\nWe provide the squared WFO and derivatives divided by powers of the quirk mass obtained in our calculations, following the same behaviour with n and l as found in standard\nquarkonium (see for instance [17] and references therein). From the ground state WFO\nvalue we realize that 1S state follows mainly a Coulombic behaviour [18]. This is not the\ncase for higher resonances, for the P states case we find that a Coulombic (derivative) WFO\nunderestimates the numerical value obtained from this potential.\nLet us stress that the energy level spacing (notably between S-wave resonances, of order\nof tens of MeV) would not permit the experimental discrimination by using the dimuon\nannihilation channel (and likely any other else).\nTable II shows the results for \u039b =\n\n0.4 * \u039bQCD = 100 MeV (\u03c3 = 0.029 GeV2 and\n\n\u03b1\u2032 (Q = 2mQ ) = 0.08). The QQ\u0304 level spacings turn out to be somewhat larger than in\nthe previous case but still not enough to permit experimental discrimination. Something\nsimilar can be expected for \u039b = \u039bQCD = 250 MeV as can be seen from Table III, with\n(\u03c3 = 0.18 GeV2 and \u03b1\u2032 (Q = 2mQ ) = 0.091). Here we find lower values for sizes of resonances\n\n11\n\n\fwith respect to previous case (as expected since \u039b increases). Besides, we observe a WFO\nvalue for the ground state somewhat greater than the expected for a Coulombic behaviour.\nThe results shown in Table IV (appendix ) corresponds to the microscopic scale \u039b =\n10 \u039bQCD . Here \u03b1\u2032 (Q = 2mQ ) = 0.139, and \u03c3 = 18 GeV2 . The string tension turns to be\nmuch stronger than in the QCD case. The energy levels reach the GeV scale and the WFO\ngrow to the \u223c 103 GeV3 values; according with previous trend the corresponding derivatives\nare growing also. The WFO value for the lowest state is \u223c 3 times greater than the expected\nfor a Coulombic behaviour. Concerning the level spacing this case is interesting since values\namong S-wave states turns out to be of order of \u223c 2 GeV, likely enough to be disentangled.\n2.\n\nmQ = 500 GeV\n\nWe now set the quirk mass equal to 500 GeV, so quirkonium mass is of order of the\nTeV scale. In Table V the QQ\u0304 spectrum is shown for \u039b =\n\n\u039bQCD (\u03c3 = 0.18 GeV\n\n2\n\nand \u03b1\u2032 (Q = 2mQ ) = 0.073). In Table VI we show the results for \u039b = 10 \u039bQCD . Here\n\u03b1\u2032 (Q = 2mQ ) = 0.102, and \u03c3 = 18 GeV 2 . Again, as in the mQ = 100 GeV case at this\nscale, the level spacing among S-wave states could be enough to distinguish experimentally\nthese levels.\n\nB.\n\nCpP potential.\n\nLet us now give \u03bd values in the long-range term of Eq.(4) different from unity. As in\nQCD, a larger (smaller) \u03bd leads to stronger (weaker) long-distance interaction. The general\ntrends are similar to the CpL case seen in the previous section.\n\n1.\n\n\u03bd = 0.5\n\nTables VII and VIII show the QQ\u0304 spectrum for mQ = 100 GeV and mQ = 500 GeV\n\n12\n\n\frespectively for \u039b = \u039bQCD . As we can see the sizes of bound states are similar to the\nbottomonium case [17],[20]. Tables IX and X (appendix) provides again the corresponding\nQQ\u0304 spectrum for mQ = 100 GeV and mQ = 500 GeV , but this time having set \u039b =\n10 * \u039bQCD . Here we observe values of WFO for the ground state similar to the ones expected\nfor a Coulombic behaviour; however higher resonances do not behave in this manner.\n\n2.\n\n\u03bd = 1.5\n\nTo cover possible deviations from linear behaviour of the long distance part of the\npotential we analyze the CpP potential setting \u03bd = 1.5. Tables XI and XII (appendix) show\nthe QQ\u0304 spectrum for with \u039b = \u039bQCD for mQ = 100 GeV and mQ = 500 GeV respectively.\nTables XIII and XIV display the corresponding results for the QQ\u0304 spectrum for mQ = 100\nGeV and mQ = 500 GeV with \u039b = 10 \u039bQCD .\nIn order to compare the effect of the above mentioned potentials, in Figure 1 we plot\nthe nS level spacings \u2206nS\u22121S = M(nS) \u2212 M(1S) of quirkonium found with the CpL and\nCpP potentials (\u03bd = 1, 0.5, 1.5 respectively) for different mQ and \u039b values. As far as we are\ninterested in disentangling peaks of S-wave resonances, it becomes apparent that this would\nbe only possible in some cases (i.e. \u039b = 10 \u039bQCD ) where the level spacing is O(1) GeV or\nlarger.\n\nC.\n\nOther possible contributions from short distance potential\n\nFinally, to take into account other contributions which could be entangled in the short\ndistance part of the potential, we consider higher (non perturbative) \u1fb1\u2032 effective values. In\norder to consider this scenario, we do not use the Eq.(6) for \u03b1\u2032 but we take it as a free\nparameter. On the other hand we keep the explicit dependence of \u039b ( Eq.(5) ) in \u03c3. In this\ncase we also increase the \u039b values from \u039b = 10 * \u039bQCD up to \u039b = 40 * \u039bQCD .\nBy using QQ-onia code we find the results with mQ = 500 GeV for the mass level spacing\n\u22062S\u22121S = M(2S) \u2212 M(1S) which are shown in Table XV (Appendix). As we can see from\n13\n\n\fthese situations, we find separation between levels tens of GeV, thus, in principle, we should\nbe able to discriminate at least between these resonances.\n\nD.\n\nWFO vs. quirk masses.\n\nNext let us analyze the WFO dependence w.r.t. the quirk mass using the above explained\nCpP potentials. Here we focus on the 1S ground level, by taking quirk mass values from\nmQ = 100 GeV up to 500 GeV . Again we will take \u039b =\n\n\u039bQCD , 10 \u039bQCD for each\n\npotential. For intermediate mQ values \u03c3 does not change w.r.t. the mass values, However\nhere \u03b1\u2032 (Q = 2mQ ) changes for each case according to Eq.(6). Figure 2 displays the obtained\nresults.\n\nIII.\n\nQUIRKONIUM DECAY\n\nOnce computed the squared WFO, we can evaluate numerically the partial decay widths\nof neutral (3 S1 ) quirkonium (\u03c8QQ\u0304 ) to different final states. All of them are proportional to\nthe ratio |RS (0)|2 /M 2 , where M is the quirkonium mass. Subsequently we make estimates\nof the respective branching ratios (BR).\nWe will follow a similar treatment as the authors of [3],[19] who considered the following\n\u03c8QQ\u0304 decay modes:\n\u2022 Decay to Standard Model fermion pairs (f f \u0304 \u2261leptons and quarks)\n|RS (0)|\n \u0304\n\u0393(\u03c8QQ\u0304 \u2212\u2192 f f \u0304) = F1f f (NIC , Ri , eQ , SM)\nM2\n\n2\n\n(7)\n\n \u0304\n\nwhere F1f f (NIC , Ri , eQ , SM) stands for functions containing the i-colour number,\nsquared mass ratios Ri = Mi2 /M 2 (i = f, Z) , the quirk electric charge eQ . The\nSM label means that those SM parameters involved in this calculation parameters are\nincluded.\n\u2022 Decay to a W \u00b1 pair\n\u0393(\u03c8QQ\u0304 \u2212\u2192 W + W \u2212 ) = F2 (NIC , Ri , SM)\n14\n\n|RS (0)|2\nM2\n\n(8)\n\n\fWhere F2 (NIC , Ri , eQ , SM) stands for a function entangling the i-colour number,\nsquared mass ratios Ri = Mi2 /M 2 (i = W, Z, mQ ), and SM parameters.\n\u2022 Decay to i-gluons (g \u2032 ). Quirks couple to the i-gluon field of the SU(NIC ) with coupling\n\u221a\nstrength gs\u2032 = 4\u03c0\u03b1s\u2032 , where \u03b1s\u2032 (Q2 ) is given by Eq.(6).\n2\n\u0393(\u03c8QQ\u0304 \u2212\u2192 g \u2032g \u2032 g \u2032) = F3 (NIC\n, \u03b1\u20323 )\n\n|RS (0)|2\nM2\n\n(9)\n\n2\nHere, F3 (NIC\n, \u03b1\u20323 ) is a function of the i-colour number and the i-colour \u03b1\u2032 coupling.\n\n\u0393(\u03c8QQ\u0304 \u2212\u2192 \u03b3 g \u2032 g \u2032) = F4 (NIC , e2Q , \u03b1\u20322 )\n\n|RS (0)|2\nM2\n\n\u0393(\u03c8QQ\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Z g \u2032 g \u2032) = F5 (NIC , e2Q , \u03b1\u20322 , SM)\n\n|RS (0)|2\nM2\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nTo make the reading easy, the explicit form of Fi (i = 1, ..., 5) coefficients can be found in\nreferences [3],[19].\n\nA.\n\nNumerical results\n\nOnce set the numerical values of parameters in the above expressions, the |RS (0)|2 values\nfrom Tables I to XIV (appendix) allow one to compute the decay widths of \u03c8QQ\u0304 (1S) to SM\n \u0304 ss\u0304, cc\u0304, bb\u0304, [tt\u0304 if above the threshold]), leptons (ll\u0304 \u2261 e\u00b1 , \u03bc\u00b1 , \u03c4 \u00b1 ),\nquarks (q q\u0304 \u2261 u\u016b, dd,\n\nand other boson decays (W \u00b1 , 3g \u2032, \u03b32g \u2032, Z2g \u2032). The results are shown in Table XVI for\nCpL and CpP (with \u03bd = 0.5, 1.5) potential using mQ = 100 GeV and mQ = 500 GeV at the\nabove considered scales.\nIn all cases the decay mode to SM quarks is the dominant channel. Decay to leptons\nshares roughly with a 33% for electron, muon and \u03c4 pair respectively. As we can see, for\n\u039b = \u039bQCD case if we take into account only the 1S decay, the total width is quite narrow\n\u223cKeV, but we find similar values than in the heavy quarkonia case [21]. For \u039b = 10\u039bQCD\ncase the total width increases roughly one order of magnitude. Nevertheless, if necessary,\nthis analysis could be improved by adding upper nS levels contributions[22]: for instance if\nwe compute the whole nS contribution using the mq = 500GeV ; \u039b = 10\u039bQCD case, with a\nCpL potential we find a total width \u2248 1.7 times the 1S total width; using CpP \u03bd = 1.5 and\n15\n\n\f\u03bd = 0.5 potentials we find a factor \u2248 1.5 and \u2248 2. respectively.\nConcerning P -wave resonances (l 6= 0), the corresponding widths satisfy\n\u0393nP \u221d\n\n|RS\u2032 (0)|2\nM4\n\n(12)\n\nso that, those contributions are suppressed with respect to the nS decays by a (D) factor\nD=\n\n1 |RP\u2032 (0)|2\nM 2 |RS (0)|2\n\nTaking n = 1 values in the CpL case from Tables , we find D \u223c [10\u22125 , 10\u22124 ] in the\n\nmQ = 100 GeV case and D \u223c [10\u22126 , 10\u22125 ] for mQ = 500 GeV . Regarding the dependence of\nthe BRs on the quirk mass (BR are independent of the ratio |RS (0)|2 /M 2 , but M enters also\n\nthorugh the functions Fi ): in the range of interest 100 \u2264 mQ \u2264 500GeV we find variations\non the different BR less than a 1%.\nWe can also check the BR variations with the i-colour number NIC : by replacing for\ninstance in the above expressions NIC = 6 \u2194 NIC = 3 \u2194 NIC = 1, the BR to bosons varies\nmainly 33% \u2194 17% \u2194 5% and the corresponding BR to SM quarks 55% \u2194 68% \u2194 78%\n(BR to leptons 12% \u2194 15% \u2194 17% respectively).\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nSpectroscopy of exotic states might play a fundamental role in the discovery strategy of\nnew physics at the LHC and ILC. In this paper we have focused on a simple extension of\nthe SM, when a new SU(Ni ) gauge group is added to the SM. The new interaction and new\nassociated fermions have been dubbed i-color, quirks respectively. We assume that quirks\nare colorless, but otherwise carry SM quantum numbers, thereby coupling to gauge W \u00b1 , Z\nand \u03b3 bosons.\nQuirks can bind forming very peculiar structures reminding. In this work we have focused\non neutral QQ\u0304 states called quirkonium, when the states are microscopic. We have performed\na prospective study of quirkonium spectroscopy by employing a Coulomb plus Linear and\nCoulomb plus Power Law potentials as representative possibilities with parameters according\nto i-QCD requirements, as well as other effective contributions to analyze their impact.\n16\n\n\fTaking into account the wide range where the QQ\u0304 bound state might be found, we\nhave chosen the scale range, MeV . \u039b . GeV with different i-colour \u039b scales and quirk\nmasses, finding sizes of several QQ\u0304nl resonances and their squared WFO values of states (or\nderivatives for l 6= 0). We also extracted the level spacing among resonances using different\n\u039b scenarios to determine whether or not it would be possible to discriminate different state\nlevels. We also have computed total and partial decay widths.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI am grateful to Miguel Angel Sanchis-Lozano for calling my attention to quirkonium\nsystems, to point out all the details concerning detection by means of the dimuon channel,\nand many discussions.\n\n[1] M.
