The preponderance of previous work has focused\non spherical particles, and very little is known about dense polyhedral packings. We formulate the\nproblem of generating dense packings of nonoverlapping, non-tiling polyhedra within an adaptive\nfundamental cell subject to periodic boundary conditions as an optimization problem, which we call\nthe Adaptive Shrinking Cell (ASC) scheme. This novel optimization problem is solved here (using\na variety of multi-particle initial configurations) to find the dense packings of each of the Platonic\nsolids in three-dimensional Euclidean space R3 , except for the cube, which is the only Platonic solid\nthat tiles space. We find the densest known packings of tetrahedra, icosahedra, dodecahedra, and\noctahedra with densities 0.823 . . ., 0.836 . . ., 0.904 . . ., and 0.947 . . ., respectively. It is noteworthy\nthat the densest tetrahedral packing possesses no long-range order. Unlike the densest tetrahedral\npacking, which must not be a Bravais lattice packing, the densest packings of the other non-tiling\nPlatonic solids that we obtain are their previously known optimal (Bravais) lattice packings. We\nalso derive a simple upper bound on the maximal density of packings of congruent nonspherical\nparticles, and apply it to Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, superballs and ellipsoids. Provided\nthat what we term the \"asphericity\" (ratio of the circumradius to inradius) is sufficiently small,\nthe upper bounds are relatively tight and thus close to the corresponding densities of the optimal\nlattice packings of the centrally symmetric Platonic and Archimedean solids. Our simulation\nresults, rigorous upper bounds, and other theoretical arguments lead us to the conjecture that\nthe densest packings of Platonic and Archimedean solids with central symmetry are given by\ntheir corresponding densest lattice packings. This can be regarded to be the analog of Kepler's\nsphere conjecture for these solids. The truncated tetrahedron is the only non-centrally symmetric\nArchimedean solid, the densest known packing of which is a non-lattice packing with density at least\nas high as 23/24 = 0.958333 . . .. We discuss the validity of our conjecture to packings of superballs,\nprisms and anti-prisms as well as to high-dimensional analogs of the Platonic solids. In addition, we\nconjecture that the optimal packing of any convex, congruent polyhedron without central symmetry\ngenerally is not a lattice packing. Finally, we discuss the possible applications and generalizations\nof the ASC scheme in the predicting the crystal structures of polyhedral nanoparticles and the\nstudy of random packings of hard polyhedra.\n\n2\n\n\fPACS numbers: 05.20.Jj, 45.70.-n, 61.50.Ah\n\n3\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nParticle packing problems are ancient, dating back to the dawn of civilization. Bernal\nhas remarked that \"heaps\" (particle packings) were the first things that were ever measured\nin the form of basketfuls of grain for the purpose of trading or of collection of taxes [1].\nDense packings of hard particles have served as useful models to understand the structure\nof liquid, glassy and crystal states of matter [2, 3, 4], granular media [5], and heterogeneous\nmaterials [3, 6]. Understanding the symmetries and other mathematical properties of the\ndensest packings in arbitrary dimensions is a problem of long-standing interest in discrete\ngeometry and number theory [7].\nA large collection of nonoverlapping solid objects (particles) in d-dimensional Euclidean\nspace Rd is called a packing. The packing density \u03c6 is defined as the fraction of space\nRd covered by the particles. A problem that has been a source of fascination to mathematicians and scientists for centuries is the determination of the densest arrangement(s)\nof particles that do not tile space and the associated maximal density \u03c6max [7]. Finding\nthe maximal-density packing arrangements is directly relevant to understanding the structure and properties of crystalline equilibrium phases of particle systems as well as their\n(zero-temperature) ground-state structures in low dimensions in which the interactions are\ncharacterized by steep repulsions and short-ranged attractions.\nThe preponderance of previous investigations have focused on dense packings of spheres\nin various dimensions [3, 7, 8, 9]. For congruent particles in three dimensions, the sphere\nis the only non-tiling particle for which the densest packing arrangements can be proved\n[10]. It is only very recently that attention has turned to finding the maximal-density\npacking arrangements of nonspherical particles in R3 , including ellipsoids [11, 12], tetrahedra\n[13, 14, 15], and superballs [16, 17]. Very little is known about the densest packings of\npolyhedral particles [18].\nThe Platonic solids (mentioned in Plato's Timaeus) are convex polyhedra with faces\ncomposed of congruent convex regular polygons. There are exactly five such solids: the\ntetrahedron (P1), icosahedron (P2), dodecahedron (P3), octahedron (P4), and cube (P5)\n(see Fig. 1) [19]. One major concern in this paper is the determination of the densest\npackings of each of the Platonic solids in three-dimensional Euclidean space R3 , except for\nthe cube, which is the only Platonic solid that tiles space.\n4\n\n\fFIG. 1: (color online). The five Platonic solids: tetrahedron (P1), icosahedron (P2), dodecahedron\n(P3), octahedron (P4), and cube (P5).\n\nIt is useful to highlight some basic geometrical properties of the Platonic solids that we\nwill employ in subsequent sections of the paper. The dihedral angle \u03b8 is the interior angle\nbetween any two face planes and is given by\nsin\n\ncos(\u03c0/q)\n\u03b8\n=\n,\n2\nsin(\u03c0/p)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere p is the number of sides of each face and q is the number of faces meeting at each\np\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nvertex. Thus, \u03b8 is 2 sin\u22121 (1/ 3), 2 sin\u22121 (\u03a6/ 3), 2 sin\u22121 (\u03a6/ \u03a62 + 1), 2 sin\u22121 ( 2/3), and\n\n\u03c0/2, for the tetrahedron, icosahedron, dodecahedron, octahedron, and cube, respectively,\n\u221a\nwhere \u03a6 = (1 + 5)/2 is the golden ratio. Thus, since the dihedral angle for the cube is the\n\nonly one that is a submultiple of 2\u03c0, the cube is the only Platonic solid that tiles space. We\nnote in passing that in addition to the regular tessellation of space by cubes in the simple\ncubic lattice arrangement, there are an infinite number of other irregular tessellations of\nspace by cubes [20]. Figure 2 shows a portion of a realization of a two-dimensional analog\nof such an irregular tessellation.\nEvery polyhedron has a dual polyhedron with faces and vertices interchanged. The dual\nof each Platonic solid is another Platonic solid, and therefore they can be arranged into dual\npairs: the tetrahedron is self-dual (i.e., its dual is another tetrahedron), the icosahedron and\ndodecahedron form a dual pair, and the octahedron and cube form a dual pair.\nAn Archimedean solid is a highly symmetric, semi-regular convex polyhedron composed\nof two or more types of regular polygons meeting in identical vertices. There are thirteen\nArchimedean solids: truncated tetrahedron (A1), truncated icosahedron (A2), snub cube\n(A3), snub dodecahedron (A4), rhombicosidodecahdron (A5), truncated icosidodecahdron\n(A6), truncated cuboctahedron (A7), icosidodecahedron (A8), rhombicuboctahedron (A9),\n5\n\n\fFIG. 2: (color online). A portion of a realization of an irregular tiling of the plane by squares.\n\nFIG. 3: The 13 Archimedean solids: truncated tetrahedron (A1), truncated icosahedron (A2),\nsnub cube (A3), snub dodecahedron (A4), rhombicosidodecahdron (A5), truncated icosidodecahdron (A6), truncated cuboctahedron (A7), icosidodecahedron (A8), rhombicuboctahedron (A9),\ntruncated dodecahedron (A10), cuboctahedron (A11), truncated cube (A12), and truncated octahedron (A13).\n\n6\n\n\ftruncated dodecahedron (A10), cuboctahedron (A11), truncated cube (A12) and truncated\noctahedron (A13) (see Fig. 3). Note that the truncated octahedron is the only Archimedean\nsolid that tiles space.\nAnother important observation is that the tetrahedron (P1) and the truncated tetrahedron (A1) are the only Platonic and Archimedean solids, respectively, that are not centrally\nsymmetric. A particle is centrally symmetric if it has a center C that bisects every chord\nthrough C connecting any two boundary points of the particle, i.e., the center is a point of\ninversion symmetry. We will see that the central symmetry of the majority of the Platonic\nand Archimedean solids (P2 \u2013 P5, A2 \u2013 A13) distinguish their dense packing arrangements\nfrom those of the non-centrally symmetric ones (P1 and A1) in a fundamental way.\nSome basic definitions concerning packings are given here. A saturated packing is one\nin which there is no space available to add another particle to the packing. A lattice \u039b in\nRd is a subgroup consisting of the integer linear combinations of vectors that constitute a\nbasis for Rd [21]. A lattice packing PL is one in which the centroids of the nonoverlapping\nparticles are located at the points of \u039b, each oriented in the same direction. The set of\nlattice packings is a subset of all possible packings in Rd . In a lattice packing, the space Rd\ncan be geometrically divided into identical regions F called fundamental cells, each of which\ncontains just the centroid of one particle. Thus, the density of a lattice packing is given by\n\u03c6=\n\nvp\n,\nVol(F )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere vp is the volume of a d-dimensional particle and Vol(F ) is the volume of a fundamental\ncell.\nA more general notion than a lattice packing is a periodic packing. A periodic packing of\ncongruent particles is obtained by placing a fixed nonoverlapping configuration of N particles\n(where N \u2265 1) with arbitrary orientations in each fundamental cell of a lattice \u039b. Thus, the\npacking is still periodic under translations by \u039b, but the N particles can occur anywhere in\nthe chosen fundamental cell subject to the nonoverlap condition. The packing density of a\nperiodic packing is given by\n\u03c6=\n\nNvp\n= \u03c1vp ,\nVol(F )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c1 = N/Vol(F ) is the number density, i.e., the number of particles per unit volume.\nThe determination of the maximal-density arrangements of non-tiling polyhedral particles is a notoriously difficult problem, especially since such extremal structures will generally\n7\n\n\fbe non-Bravais-lattice packings. Computer simulations that seek the maximal-density packings can be an indispensable tool, especially if they can incorporate collective motions of the\nparticles in order to obtain, in principle, the highest possible densities. However, the challenge presented by polyhedral particles in R3 is the non-smooth (i.e., nonanalytic) nature\nof the particle shape. In the case of smoothly-shaped particles, such as spheres, ellipsoids\nand superballs, one can construct analytic \"overlap potential functions\" for the particles [24]\nand hence one can employ efficient collision-driven molecular dynamics (MD) growth packing algorithms that inherently involve collective particle motions [12, 16, 17, 25, 26]. The\nfact that analytic overlap potential functions cannot be constructed for polyhedral particles\nprevents us from using event-driven MD growth methods to study such systems.\nIn this paper, we devise a novel optimization scheme, called the Adaptive Shrinking Cell\n(ASC), that can be applied to generate dense packings of polyhedra in R3 . We employ it\nspecifically to obtain the densest known packings of tetrahedra, icosahedra, dodecahedra,\nand octahedra with densities 0.823 . . . , 0.836 . . ., 0.904 . . ., and 0.947 . . ., respectively. The\nresult for tetrahedra improves upon the density reported in our recent investigation [27, 28].\nUnlike the densest tetrahedral packing, which must not be a Bravais lattice packing [13], the\ndensest packings of the other non-tiling Platonic solids that we obtain are their corresponding\ndensest lattice packings [22, 23].\nWe also derive a simple upper bound on the maximal density of packings of congruent\nnonspherical particles, and apply it to Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, superballs and\nellipsoids. We introduce the \"asphericity\" parameter \u03b3 (ratio of the circumradius to inradius)\nto show that when \u03b3 is sufficiently small, the upper bounds are relatively tight and thus close\nto the corresponding densities of the optimal lattice packings of octahedra, dodecahedra and\nicosahedra as well as of the majority of the Archimedean solids with central symmetry.\nOur simulation results as well as theoretical arguments lead us to conjecture that the\ndensest packings of Platonic and Archimedean solids with central symmetry are given by\ntheir corresponding densest lattice packings. This can be regarded to be the analog of\nKepler's sphere conjecture for these solids. The truncated tetrahedron is the only noncentrally symmetric Archimedean solid, the densest known packing of which is a non-lattice\npacking with density as high as 23/24 = 0.958333 . . .. Our work also suggests that the\noptimal packings of superballs are their corresponding densest lattice packings.\nIn a recent letter [27], we briefly reported the densest known packings of the non-tiling\n8\n\n\fPlatonic solids obtained using the ASC algorithm and proposed the aforementioned conjecture concerning the optimal packings of the Platonic and Archimedean solids. In this paper,\nwe expand on theoretical and computational details and report additional new results. In\nparticular, we provide comprehensive details about the ASC scheme and the simulation results (Sec. II), including a discussion about the various initial configurations we used for the\nASC algorithm (Sec. III). Moreover, we have improved on the highest tetrahedral packing\ndensity reported in Ref. [27] (i.e., from 0.782 . . . to 0.823 . . .), by exploring a broad range of\ndynamical parameters for the algorithm and initial configurations. Certain pair statistics of\nthe densest known packing of tetrahedra (e.g., the contact number, the centroidal correlation function and the face-normal correlation function) are given (Sec. III). It is noteworthy\nthat the densest tetrahedral packing is a non-Bravais structure with a complex periodic cell\nand possesses no long-range order.\nThe initial configurations for the icosahedral, dodecahedral and octahedral packings are\ndescribed and the numerical challenges in producing dense packings of such polyhedral\nparticles are discussed (Sec. III). In addition, a detailed derivation of the upper bound and\ntables containing the geometrical characteristics of the Platonic and Archimedean solids as\nwell as their upper bound values are given (Sec. IV). The upper bound is also applied\nto superballs and ellipsoids (which was not done in Ref. [27]). Moreover, we provide the\nmajor elements of a possible proof of our conjecture (Sec. V). We also discuss how our\nconjecture could be generalized to other centrally symmetric polyhedral particles such as\nprisms and anti-prisms as well as high-dimensional analogs of the Platonic solids. Our\nwork also naturally leads to another conjecture reported here for the first time, namely, the\noptimal packing of any convex, congruent polyhedron without central symmetry is generally\nnot a (Bravais) lattice packing (Sec. V).\nFurthermore, we discuss the possible applications and generalizations of the ASC scheme\nto predict the crystal structures of polyhedral nanoparticles and to the study of random\npackings of hard polyhedra. Finally, we collect in appendices basic packing characteristics\nof various optimal lattice and non-lattice packings of polyhedra (including lattice vectors)\nthat have been scattered throughout the literature and provide lattice vectors and other\ncharacteristics of the densest known packings of tetrahedra (obtained here) and truncated\ntetrahedra.\n\n9\n\n\fII.\n\nADAPTIVE SHRINKING CELL (ASC) OPTIMIZATION SCHEME\n\nWe formulate the problem of generating dense packings of nonoverlapping, non-tiling\npolyhedra within a fundamental cell in R3 subject to periodic boundary conditions as an\noptimization problem. In particular, the objective function is taken to be the negative of the\npacking density \u03c6. Starting from an initial unsaturated packing configuration of particles of\nfixed size in the fundamental cell, the positions and orientations of the polyhedra are design\nvariables for the optimization. Importantly, we also allow the boundary of the fundamental\ncell to deform macroscopically as well as compress or expand (while keeping the particles\nfixed in size) such that there is a net compression (increase of the density of the packing) in\nthe final state [29]. Thus, the deformation and compression/expansion of the cell boundary,\nwhich we call the adaptive fundamental cell, are also design variables. We are not aware of\nany packing algorithm that employs both a sequential search of the configurational space\nof the particles and the space of lattices via an adaptive fundamental cell that shrinks\non average to obtain dense packings. We will call this optimization scheme the Adaptive\nShrinking Cell (ASC).\nWe will see that the ASC optimization scheme allows for some desired collective motions\nof the particles to find the optimal lattice for the periodic cell. This is to be contrasted with\nprevious treatments that use a fixed shape for the fundamental cell, which may or may not\nbe the optimal shape. Figure 4 illustrates a simple sequence of configuration changes for a\nfour-particle system (which is explained in more detail in Sec. II.A). By efficiently exploring\nthe design-variable space (DVS), which consists of the particle configurational space as well\nas the space of lattices via an adaptive fundamental cell, the ASC scheme enables one to\nfind a point in the DVS in the neighborhood of the starting point that has a higher packing\ndensity than the initial density. The process is continued until the deepest minimum of the\nobjective function (a maximum of packing density) is obtained, which could be either a local\nor global optimum, depending on the particle shapes.\nThe ASC optimization problem could be solved using various techniques, depending on\nthe shapes of the particles. For example, for spheres, one can linearize the objective function\nand the constraints, and we have found that linear programming techniques can efficiently\nproduce optimal solutions for such ASC problems [30]. However, for hard polyhedra the\nnon-overlapping conditions given by the separation axis theorem (discussed in detail below)\n10\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 4: (color online). Sequential changes of the packing configuration due to the design variables in the ASC algorithm. (a) An initial configuration of four particles. (b) A trial move of a\nrandomly selected particle that is rejected because it overlaps another particle. (c) A trial move\nthat is accepted, which results in a deformation and compression (small in magnitude) changing\nthe fundamental cell shape and size as well as the relative distances between the particles. The\nlarge fundamental cell is divided into smaller sub-cells in order to implement the \"cell method\"\ndiscussed in Sec. II.D.\n\ninvolve at least quartic inequalities, which makes it inefficient to solve even using nonlinear\nprogramming methods.\nHere, for polyhedral particles, we solve the ASC optimization problem using a stochastic\nprocedure, i.e., Monte Carlo (MC) method with a Metropolis acceptance rule for trial moves\nto search the DVS efficiently. However, it is important to distinguish our procedure that\nincorporates deformation and compression/expansion of the fundamental cell (i.e., the space\nof lattices) as design variables from previous MC hard-particle packing algorithms [31]. In\nstandard MC simulations, arbitrarily selected individual particle is given random displacement or rotation. This sequential movement method is not able to account for any collective\nmotions of the particles, which is crucial to increasing the packing density, as pointed out in\nSec. I. In our procedure, the deformation/compression/expansion of the boundary at least\nin part allows for collective particle motions in a direction leading to higher packing density. Moreover, it is the overall compression of the fundamental cell that causes the packing\ndensity to increase, not the growth of the particles as in most MD and MC hard-particle\n\n11\n\n\fpacking algorithms [25, 26, 31].\nAt first glance, one might surmise that an algorithm that employs particle growth with\nan adaptive non-shrinking fundamental cell is equivalent to our choice of fixing the particle\nsize while allowing the cell to shrink on average. The former is computationally less efficient\nthan the latter for polyhedral particles. Specifically, growth of polyhedral particles requires\nmanipulating the coordinates of the vertices of each particle, and thus involves at least dNnv\nnumerical operations, where d is the spatial dimension, N is the total number of particles in\nthe system and nv is the number of vertices per particle. It is much more computationally\nexpensive to use growing/shrinking particles as trial moves for the optimization scheme,\nespecially when the number of particles is large, compared to our adaptive fundamental cell\napproach, which only requires manipulating d(d + 1)/2 strain components.\nIn the ASC scheme, the macroscopic deformation and compression/expansion of the fundamental cell of the lattice is completely specified by a strain tensor. Since we only consider\nsmall deformations, linear strain analysis can be applied here. Starting from an initial configuration, a trial configuration can be generated by moving (translating and rotating) a randomly chosen particle or by a random macroscopic deformation and compression/expansion\nof the fundamental cell. If any two particles overlap, the trial configuration is rejected;\notherwise, if the fundamental cell shrinks in size (which makes the density \u03c6 higher), the\ntrial configuration is accepted. On the other hand, if the cell expands in size, the trial\nconfiguration is accepted with a specified probability pacc , which decreases as \u03c6 increases\nand approaches zero when the jamming limit [32] (i.e., locally maximal dense packing) is\nreached. In particular, we find pacc , with an initial value pacc \u223c 0.35, decreasing as a power\nlaw with exponent equal to -1 works well for most systems that we studied. The particle\nmotion is equally likely to be a translation or a rotation. The ratio of the number of particle\nmotions to the number of boundary trial moves should be greater than unity (especially\ntowards the end of the simulation), since compressing a dense packing could result in many\noverlaps between the particles. Depending on the initial density, the magnitudes of the\nparticle motions and strain components (e.g., the dynamical parameters) need to be chosen\ncarefully to avoid the system getting stuck in some shallow local minimum. The parameters should also be adjusted accordingly as the packing density increases, especially towards\nthe jamming point. The number of total Monte-Carlo moves per particle is of the order of\n5 \u00d7 106 .\n12\n\n\fIn the ensuing subsections, we describe in detail how we implement particle motions as\nwell as the deformation and compression/expansion of the fundamental cell, and precise\ncheck for interparticle overlaps using the separation axis theorem [33]. We also discuss the\ncell method and nearest-neighbor lists that are employed to speed up the simulations.\n\nA.\n\nParticle Motions\n\nThe fact that a polyhedron is the convex hull of its vertices makes the set of vertices a\nuseful geometrical representation of a such particle. It is convenient to choose the origin\nof the local coordinate system for the vertices to be the centroid of the polyhedron. Other\nimportant geometrical properties of the polyhedron, such as its faces and edges, can be\nrepresented as certain subsets of the vertices.\nLet the Euclidean position of the centroid of the jth particle be xE\nj (j = 1, .., N). A\ntranslational motion of the particle centroid can be obtained by generating a randomly\n\u22124\noriented displacement \u2206xE\n\u2212 10\u22126 of the characteristic length\nj with small magnitude (10\n\nof the particle), i.e.,\nE\nE\nx\u0304E\nj = xj + \u2206xj .\n\n(4)\n\nA rotational motion can be generated by rotating the particle (all of its vertices) along a\nrandomly chosen axis (passing through its centroid) by a random small angle \u03b8. Let the\nvector vi originating at the centroid denote the vertex i. We have\nk\n\nv\u0304i = R * vi\u22a5 + vi ,\n\n(5)\n\nk\n\nwhere vi\u22a5 and vi are the components of vi perpendicular and parallel to the rotation axis,\nrespectively, and R is the rotation matrix, i.e.,\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\ncos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8 0\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\nR = \uf8ef sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 0 \uf8fa .\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n0\n0\n1\n\n(6)\n\nIf this motion does not result in the overlap with another particle, the trial move is accepted;\notherwise it is rejected.\n\n13\n\n\fB.\n\nAdaptive Fundamental Cell\n\nFor a lattice-based periodic packing, the fundamental cell is specified by the lattice vectors\nai (i = 1, 2, 3). Recall that the Euclidean coordinates of the particle centroids are xE\nj\n(j = 1, .., N). The relative coordinates of the centroids with respect to the lattice vectors\nare given by\nL\nxE\nj = \u0393 * xj ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u0393 = [a1 , a2 , a3 ].\nThe adaptive fundamental cell allows for a small strain of the fundamental cell, including\nboth volume and shape changes, which is represented by a symmetric strain tensor \u03b5, i.e.,\n\u2206\u0393 = \u03b5 * \u0393,\nwhere\n\n(8)\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\n\uf8ef 11 12 13 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\u03b5 = \uf8ef \u01eb21 \u01eb22 \u01eb23 \uf8fa ,\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n\u01eb31 \u01eb32 \u01eb33\n\n(9)\n\nand the new fundamental cell (lattice vectors) are given by\n\u0393\u0304 = \u0393 + \u2206\u0393.\n\n(10)\n\nSubstituting the above equation into Eq. (4), we have\nL\nE\nL\nx\u0304E\nj = \u0393\u0304 * xj = xj + \u2206\u0393 * xj .\n\n(11)\n\nThus, the strain of the fundamental cell corresponds to non-trivial collective motions of\nthe particle centroids (see Fig. 4). In general, the translational motions of the particles contain the contributions from a random independent part (given by Eq. (4)) and the collective\nmotion imposed by the adaptive fundamental cell. It is this collective motion that enables\nthe algorithm to explore the configuration space more efficiently and to produce highly dense\npackings.\n\nC.\n\nChecking Overlaps and the Separation Axis Theorem\n\nHard polyhedron particles, unlike spheres, ellipsoids and superballs, do not possess simple\noverlap potential functions. Thus, the check of overlapping for such particles requires other\n14\n\n\ftechniques. Two convex objects are separated in space if and only if there exist an axis, on\nwhich the line segments defined by projections of the two objects do not overlap (see Fig. 5).\nThis statement is usually referred to as the separation axis theorem (SAT) [33].\n\nFIG. 5: (color online). Two nonoverlapping particles and one of their separation axes.\n\nFor convex polyhedra, the above theorem has a simpler version. Since a polyhedron\nis completely defined by its vertices, the line segment on the axis is defined by the most\nseparated two projections of the vertices. Moreover, the axis is either perpendicular to one\nof the faces or perpendicular to a pair of edges, one from each polyhedron. This reduces the\nnumber of axes that need to be checked from infinity to [E(E \u2212 1)/2 + 2F ], where E and F\nis the number of edges and faces of the polyhedron, respectively. Here we employ the SAT\nto check for interparticle overlaps numerically up to the highest machine precision.\nFor polyhedra whose circumscribed and inscribed spheres are well defined, two particles\nare guaranteed to overlap if the centroidal separation is smaller than the inscribed diameter\nand guaranteed not to overlap if the centroidal separation is larger than the circumscribed\ndiameter. This pre-check dramatically speeds up the simulations starting from configurations\nwith low densities.\n\nD.\n\nCell Method and Near-Neighbor List\n\nThe well-developed cell method [25, 26] for particle-system simulation is used here to\nspeed up the process. However, the simulation box (fundamental cell) will not remain a\n15\n\n\fFIG. 6: (color online). The particles (black) in the central fundamental cell (with red boundary) and their images (gray). The distances between the particles in the central cell and all the\ncorresponding images need to be checked.\n\ncube during the simulation and several conventional techniques developed for cubic box\nneed modifications. In particular, to obtain the minimum image distances, all surrounding\nboxes need to be checked explicitly (see Fig. 6). With the help of the relative-coordinate\nrepresentation of the particle centroids, the separation vector of a pair of particles is given\nby\ndS = \u0393 * (xLi \u2212 xLj + L),\n\n(12)\n\nwhere L is a vector with the values of components to be 1, 0 or -1. Note L can also be\nconsidered as the index of the box that the image particle is in.\nThe cells are taken to be the same shapes as the simulation box. Partitions of the particle\ncentroids into the cells are also convenient for relative coordinate representations, i.e., the\nindex of the cell (represented by a vector) C for particle i is given by\nC = [NC xLi ],\n\n(13)\n\nwhere [X] gives the smallest integer part of X and NC is the number of cells. Note that\nthe boundary deformations and rotations of particles do not affect the cells in which the\nparticles are situated; only translations may cause transitions between the different cells.\n16\n\n\fFor dense packings, we make use of a near-neighbor list (NNL) to further improve the\nefficiency of the algorithm [25, 26]. In particular, when the packing density is high, each\nparticle is \"trapped\" in a \"cage\" formed by its near neighbors. These near-neighbor configurations are practically stationary, i.e., the particles undergo very small \"jiggling\" motions.\nThus, to check for overlapping between the particles, one only needs to consider a particles\nnearest neighbors. If a large magnitude translation is made, the NNL needs to be set up\nagain.\n\nIII.\n\nAPPLICATION OF THE ASC SCHEME TO THE PLATONIC SOLIDS AND\n\nRESULTS\n\nHere we apply the ASC scheme to obtain the densest known packings of the non-tiling\nPlatonic solids. Due to its lack of central symmetry, the tetrahedron presents the greatest\nchallenge for the numerical solution procedure of the ASC scheme because of its tendency\nto get stuck in local (density) minima, which is a consequence of the associated \"rugged\"\nenergy or, more precisely, \"density\" landscape (e.g., the packing density as function of the\ncentroidal positions and orientations of all of the particles in the fundamental cell). Hence,\nthe choice of initial configurations becomes crucial in getting dense tetrahedral packings. By\ncontrast, the central symmetry of the octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron results in\ndensity landscapes for the numerical procedure that are appreciably less rugged than that\nfor tetrahedral packings.\n\nA.\n\nTetrahedra\n\nThe determination of the densest packings of regular tetrahedra is part of the 18th problem of Hilbert's famous set of problems. It is of interest to note that the densest (Bravais)\nlattice packing of tetrahedra (which requires all of the tetrahedra to have the same orientations) has the relatively low density \u03c6Lmax = 18/49 = 0.367 . . . and each tetrahedron touches\n14 others [34]. Recently, Conway and Torquato showed that the densest packings of regular\ntetrahedra must not be a Bravais lattice packings, and found packings with density as large\nas \u03c6 \u2248 0.72 [13]. One such packing is based upon the filling of \"imaginary\" icosahedra with\nthe densest arrangement of 20 tetrahedra and then employing the densest lattice packing\n\n17\n\n\fof icosahedra. A slightly higher density was achieved by a perturbation of the so-called\n\"Welsh\" packings with density \u03c6 = 17/24 \u2248 0.708 [13]. Using \"tetrahedral\" dice, Chaikin\net al. [14] experimentally generated jammed disordered packings of such dice with \u03c6 \u2248 0.75.\nEven though the dice are not perfect tetrahedra (because the vertices and edges are slightly\nrounded), these experimental results suggested that the densest packings of tetrahedra could\nexceed the highest densities reported by Conway and Torquato. Indeed, Chen [15] has recently discovered a periodic packing of tetrahedra with \u03c6 = 0.7786 . . . [35]. We will call\nthis the \"wagon-wheels\" packing because the basic subunits consist of two orthogonally intersecting \"wagon\" wheels. A \"wagon wheel\" consists of five contacting tetrahedra packed\naround a common edge (see Fig. 1a of Ref. 13).\nTABLE I: Some packing characteristics of certain known tetrahedral packings. Here \u03c6 is the\npacking density, N is the number of particles in the fundamental cell, and Z\u0304 is the average contact\nnumber per particle.\n\n1.\n\nName\n\n\u03c6\n\nLocally Jammed\n\nN\n\nZ\u0304\n\nOptimal Lattice [34]\n\n18/49 \u2248 0.367346\n\nYes\n\n1\n\n14\n\nUniform [13]\n\n2/3 \u2248 0.666666\n\nYes\n\n2\n\n10\n\nWelsh [13]\n\n17/24 \u2248 0.708333\n\nNo\n\n34\n\n25.9\n\nIcosahedral [13]\n\n0.716559\n\nNo\n\n20\n\n20.6\n\nWagon Wheels [15]\n\n0.778615\n\nYes\n\n18\n\n7.1\n\nInitial Conditions\n\nBecause we will use all of the aforementioned tetrahedral packing arrangements as initial conditions in our numerical solution procedure for the ASC optimization problem, we\ndescribe them now in a bit more detail. Table I summarizes some of their packing characteristics, including the packing density \u03c6, the number of particles N in the fundamental cell,\nthe average number of contacting particles per particle Z\u0304, and whether the packing is locally\njammed. A packing is locally jammed if each particle is locally trapped by its neighbors,\ni.e., it cannot be translated or rotated while fixing the positions and orientations of all the\nother particles [32, 36].\n18\n\n\fIn the optimal lattice packing, each tetrahedron touches 14 others via edges and vertices.\nIn the uniform packing, the tetrahedra are \"locked\" in a planer layer, and each particle\nhas eight in-plane partial face-to-face contacts and two edge-to-edge contacts (contributed\nby the two layers above and below), and therefore each particle contacts 10 others. In the\nicosahedral packing, the tetrahedra have a greater degree of freedom to move, and indeed it\nis not locally jammed. The 20 tetrahedra inside the imaginary icosahedron are required to\nmeet at its centroid, and so each tetrahedron has 20 vertex-to-vertex contacts. Placing the\nimaginary icosahedra on the sites of its optimal lattice results in a tetrahedral packing with 12\npartial face-to-face contacts. Thus, there are 8 tetrahedra that have 20 contacts per particle\nand 12 tetrahedra with 21 contacts per particle, and therefore Z\u0304 = (8 \u00d7 20 + 12 \u00d7 21)/20 =\n20.6.\nThe Welsh packing is based on the \"primitive Welsh\" tessellation of R3 into truncated\nlarge tetrahedra and small regular tetrahedra [13]. Interestingly, the \"primitive Welsh\" configuration is closely related to the uniform packing, i.e., it can be constructed by replicating\na periodic packing with two truncated large tetrahedra and two small regular tetrahedra\nin the fundamental cell. Each truncated large tetrahedron can be divided into 12 \"Welsh\nlows\", and 4 \"Welsh medials,\" following the notation in Ref. 13. The Welsh medials and\nWelsh lows are tetrahedra with lower symmetry than regular tetrahedra, which are referred\nto as the \"Welsh highs.\" To construct the Welsh packing, we insert Welsh highs (regular\ntetrahedra) into the Welsh low and medial regions. We will refer to the regular tetrahedra\nthat are placed in the Welsh low, medial and high regions as lows, medials and highs, respectively. In the Welsh packing, each high makes 4 face-to-face contacts with 4 medials.\nEach medial contacts 24 lows and 3 other medials at the centroid of the large truncated\ntetrahedron; moreover, each medial makes a face-to-face contact with one high. Thus, each\nmedial has 28 contacts. Each low contacts 23 other lows and 4 medials at the centroid of\nthe large truncated tetrahedron. Thus, in total each low has 27 contacts. Each truncated\nlarge tetrahedron has 12 lows and 4 medials. Thus, the number of basis particles in the\nfundamental cell N = 34 and Z\u0304 = (12 \u00d7 27 + 4 \u00d7 28 + 1 \u00d7 4)/17 = 440/17 = 25.882352 . . ..\nIn the fundamental cell of the wagon-wheels packing, there are N = 18 particles, forming\ntwo clusters, each of which includes two \"wheels\" entangled orthogonally to each other.\nEach cluster has a central connection particle, an \"upper\" wheel and a \"lower\" wheel.\nThe central particle contacts the other 8 tetrahedra through two of its edges. Each of\n19\n\n\fthe other 8 tetrahedra has 4 edge contacts with particles in its own cluster and 3 partial\nface-to-face contacts with particles from other clusters. Thus the average contact number\nZ\u0304 = (1 \u00d7 8 + 8 \u00d7 7)/9 = 64/9 = 7.111111 . . .. The coordinates of all of the 18 tetrahedra in\nthe fundamental cell can be found on the authors' website [37].\n\n2.\n\nDense Packings\n\nWe employ our algorithm to obtain dense packings of tetrahedra using initial configurations that are based upon the known packings given in Table I as well as certain dilute\npackings with carefully chosen fundamental cells and the number of particles. Note that\nthese dilute packings were not used as initial configurations to obtain the results reported\nin Ref. [27]. A range of initial densities is used to yield the largest possible densities in the\nfinal states, as summarized in Table II.\nFor initial conditions using the known packings in Table I, the fundamental cell is isotropically expanded with the relative coordinates of the tetrahedra fixed so that the initial packing\nis locally unjammed with a lower density \u03c6int . The highest density of 0.782 obtained from\nthis subset of initial conditions started from the \"wagon-wheels\" packing, which was the\nvalue reported in Ref. [27].\nFor the aforementioned dilute packings, a variety of fundamental cell shapes spanning\nfrom that for the simple cubic lattice to that of the hexagonal close packing as well as a\nwide range of particle numbers spanning from 70 to 350 are explored to generate the dense\npackings. Specifically, the densest known tetrahedral packing is obtained from a dilute initial\npacking with a rhombical fundamental cell similar to that of the hexagonal close packing\nand 314 particles (see Table II). The particles are originally placed in the fundamental cell\nrandomly and then the system is sufficiently equilibrated with the fundamental cell fixed.\nThe final packing configuration has a density of about 0.823 and is shown in Fig. 7 from\ntwo different viewpoints. The optimized lattice vectors for the densest packing and other\ncharacteristics are given in Appendix B. We see that the packing lacks long-range order\nand is composed of \"'clusters\" of distorted wagon wheels and individual tetrahedra. Thus,\nwe call this dense arrangement the \"disordered wagon wheels\" packing. We will comment\nfurther about the significance of achieving this remarkably high density with a disordered\npacking in the Discussion and Conclusions (Sec. V).\n20\n\n\fTABLE II: Dense tetrahedral packings generated from our algorithm using initial configurations\nbased upon the packings given Table I and the dilute packing as described in the text.

We\ncall this the \"disordered wagon-wheels\" packing. (a) Viewed from the side. (b) Viewed from the\ntop. It is apparent that the packing lacks long-range order and consists of \"clusters\" of distorted\nwagon wheels.\n3.\n\nStatistics of the Densest Tetrahedral Packing\n\nContact Numbers: The contact numbers of the densest tetrahedral packing as well as\nthose obtained using the other five initial configurations (Table I) are given in Table II. To\ndetermine contacting neighbors, it is crucial to find the interparticle gaps first. In particular,\n\n21\n\n\feach of the equilateral triangular faces of the tetrahedra is discretized into M equal-sized\nsmaller triangles and the distances between the vertices of the small triangles of the neighboring tetrahedra are computed, the minimum of which is used as the gap value between\nthe two corresponding tetrahedra. For our packings, when M > 200, the values of interparticle gaps obtained by this approximation scheme become stable and converge to the true\ngap values. Like any packing generated via computer simulations, the particles never form\nperfect contacts and hence contacting neighbors must be determined by setting a tolerance\nT for the interparticle gaps. Here we choose T to be equal to the mean value of the gaps\n(of order 10\u22122 to 10\u22123 of the edge length) such that any gap less than T is associated with\na contact. This procedure yields the contact numbers given in Table II. In particular, we\nfind that in the disordered wagon wheels packing, there are approximately 6.3 face-to-face\nor partial face-to-face contacts and 1.1 edge-to-edge contacts.\nFace-Normal Correlation Function: An important statistical descriptor for packings of\nnon-spherical particles is the particle orientation correlation function, which measures the\nextent to which a particle's orientation affects the orientation of another particle at a different\nposition. For highly symmetric particle shapes, it is reasonable to focus on those pair\nconfigurations in which the particles are in the same orientation, since particle alignment\nis associated with dense configurations and phase transitions that may occur. However,\nbecause tetrahedra lack central symmetry, we found that face-to-face contacts are favored\nby the dense packings, instead of face-to-vertex contacts, which are necessarily associated\nwith aligning tetrahedral configurations, such as in the case of the optimal lattice packing.\n1\n0.8\n\nCFN(r)\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nr/(2rin)\n\nFIG. 8: The face-normal correlation function CF N (r) of the densest known packing of tetrahedra\nobtained here, where rin is the radius of the insphere of a tetrahedron.\n\n22\n\n\fThus, because our interest is in dense tetrahedral packings, we determine the \"facenormal\" correlation function CF N (r), which we define as the average of the largest negative\nvalue of the inner product of two face normals of a pair of tetrahedra separated by a distance\nr. This quantity is plotted in Fig. 8. The strong positive peak values, ranging from r =\n\u221a\n2rin = d0 / 6 (where rin is the radius of the insphere of the tetrahedron and d0 is the\nedge length of the particle) to r slightly greater than 2rin , indicate a large number of faceto-face contacts between neighboring particles, implying strong short-range orientational\ncorrelations. The fact that CF N (r) plateaus to its maximum or near maximum value, for\nthe distance interval r/(2rin ) \u2208 (1, 2.2), indicates that there are partial face-to-face contacts\nin which particles slide relative to one another such that the distance between the centroids\ncan increase while the face-normal inner product remains the same. The \"valleys\" of CF N (r)\nwith relatively small magnitudes are manifestations of weak particle alignments (alignment\nin the same direction), which are local configurations that are necessary \"costs\" to achieve\nthe largest face-to-face contact numbers on average.\nCentroidal Radial Distribution Function: Another statistical descriptor of the structure\nis the centroidal radial distribution function g2 (r). In particular, g2 (r)r 2 dr is proportional\nto the conditional probability that a particle centroid is found in a spherical shell with\nthickness dr at a radial distance r from another particle centroid at the origin. It is well\nestablished that when there is no long-range order in the system, g2 decays to unity very fast.\nFigure 9 shows the centroidal radial distribution of the densest known tetrahedral packing.\nWe see that g2 (r) decays to unity after a few oscillations, indicating that the packing lacks\nlong-range order.\n\nB.\n\nOctahedra\n\nTo obtain dense packings of octahedra, we use a wide range of initial configurations. This\nincludes unsaturated packings in which the particles are randomly oriented and positioned\nwith densities spanning the range from 0.2 to 0.35 as well as unsaturated simple cubic (SC)\nand face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice packings with densities from 0.1 to 0.125, and the\noptimal lattice packings with densities from 0.3 to 0.55 are used. We found that, using small\ncompression rates for the random initial configurations and moderate compression rates for\nthe various lattice configurations along with a sufficient number of particle displacements\n23\n\n\f6\n5\n\ng2(r)\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nr/(2rin)\n\nFIG. 9: The centroidal radial distribution function g2 (r) of the densest known packing of tetrahedra,\nwhere rin is the radius of the insphere of a tetrahedron.\n\nand rotations, resulted in final configurations with densities larger than 0.93 that are very\nclose in structure and density to the optimal lattice packing. More specifically, starting\nfrom the unsaturated SC lattice (with density 0.1) and optimal lattice (with density 0.55)\npackings, final packings with densities very slightly larger than the value 0.947003 . . . can be\nobtained, which are extremely close in structure and density to the optimal lattice packing\n(\u03c6Lmax = 0.947368 . . .) [22]. A previous study involving an event-driven molecular dynamics\ngrowth algorithm for the case of octahedral-like superballs led to the same the densest lattice\npacking, which lends further credence to the fact that this lattice is indeed optimal among all\npackings [17]. Each octahedron in the optimal lattice packing, depicted in Fig. 10, contacts\n14 others and its lattice vectors are given in Appendix A.\n\nFIG. 10: A portion of the optimal lattice packing of octahedra.\n\n24\n\n\fC.\n\nIcosahedra\n\nAs in the case of octahedra, we use a variety of initial conditions to get dense packings\nof icosahedra. This includes unsaturated packings in which the icosahedra are randomly\noriented and positioned with densities spanning the range from 0.2 to 0.3 as well as various\nunsaturated lattice packings, such as the BCC, FCC and the densest lattice packing, with\ndensities spanning the range from 0.3 to 0.65. We found that by starting from a low-density\nconfiguration, with a small enough compression rate and sufficient number of particle moves,\none can always obtain a final configuration that is very close to the optimal lattice packing\nwith a density \u03c6 \u2248 0.83. An initial configuration of an unsaturated optimal lattice packing\nconfiguration with a density 0.65 gives a final packing with density 0.836315 . . ., which is\nextremely close in structure and density to the optimal lattice packing (\u03c6Lmax = 0.836357 . . .)\n[23]. Each icosahedron of the optimal lattice packing, depicted in Fig. 11, contacts 12 others\nand its lattice vectors are given in Appendix A.\n\nFIG. 11: A portion of the optimal lattice packing of icosahedra.\n\nD.\n\nDodecahedra\n\nUnsaturated random packings with densities ranging from 0.15 to 0.3 as well as unsaturated simple cubic and the optimal lattice packings with densities spanning the range from\n0.3 to 0.6 are employed as initial configurations to generate dense packings of dodecahedra.\nWe found that it is algorithmically more difficult to avoid local density maxima for dodecahedra than octahedron and icosahedron packings discussed above. For example, starting from\n25\n\n\frandom configurations, even with sufficiently small compression rate and a large number of\nparticle moves, we can only achieve apparently jammed final packings with densities in the\nrange from 0.83 to 0.85. When we use an unsaturated optimal lattice packing with density\n0.72 as an initial condition, we can generate a final packing with \u03c6 = 0.904002 . . ., which is\nrelatively close in structure and density to the optimal lattice packing (\u03c6Lmax = 0.904508 . . .)\n[23]. Each dodecahedron of the optimal lattice packing, depicted in Fig. 12, contacts 12\nothers and its lattice vectors are given in Appendix A.\n\nFIG. 12: A portion of the optimal lattice packing of dodecahedra.\n\nWe note that the tendency for dodecahedral packings to get stuck in local-density maxima\nin our algorithm is due to the fact that in some sense the dodecahedron is a shape that is\nintermediate between the octahedron and icosahedron. Specifically, for octahedral packings,\nthe octahedral symmetry of the particles facilitates the formation of nematic phases at\nrelatively high densities, which can then be easily compressed into a dense crystalline phase\nwith adaptive fundamental cells. An icosahedron is highly isotropic and possesses a large\nnumber of faces. Thus, at low densities, the icosahderal packing behaves like a hard-sphere\nfluid, and it is only near the jamming point that the asphericity of the icosahedron begins\nto play an important role. Again, by allowing the fundamental cell to adapt in the case of\nicosahedra, the optimal lattice that best accommodates the packing can be easily identified.\nHowever, for our algorithm, the dodecahedral packing behaves differently from either the\noctahedral or icosahedral packings. In particular, while dodecahedra are more isotropic\nthan octahedra, which strongly suppresses the formation of nematic phases, they have fewer\nbut larger faces than icosahedra, which favors the formation of face-to-face contacts that\n26\n\n\fends up jamming the dodecahedral packing at lower densities than either the octahedral or\nicosahedral packings.\n\nIV.\n\nUPPER BOUND ON THE MAXIMAL DENSITY OF PACKINGS OF NON-\n\nSPHERICAL PARTICLES\n\nHere we derive a simple upper bound on the maximal density \u03c6max of a packing of\ncongruent nonspherical particles of volume vp in any Euclidean space dimension d. We will\nsee that this bound will aid in our analysis of the optimality of not only the Platonic and\nArchimedean solids but also superballs. Let \u03c6Smax be the maximal density of a d-dimensional\npacking of congruent spheres and let vs represent the volume of the largest sphere than can\nbe inscribed in the nonspherical particle.\nLemma: The maximal density of a packing of congruent nonspherical particles is bounded\nfrom above according to the following bound [39]:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nvp S\n\u03c6max \u2264 min\n\u03c6 ,1 ,\nvs max\n\n(14)\n\nwhere min[x, y] denotes the minimum of x and y.\nThe proof is straightforward. The maximal packing density \u03c6max can be expressed in\nterms of the maximal number density \u03c1max via the relation\n\u03c6max = \u03c1max vp .\n\n(15)\n\nIf we inscribe within each nonspherical particle of the packing the largest possible sphere, it\nis clear that\n\u03c1max vs \u2264 \u03c6Smax ,\n\n(16)\n\nand therefore combination of the last two equations yields the upper bound of the Lemma.\nRemark: The upper bound (14) will yield a reasonably tight bound for packings of nonspherical particles provided that the asphericity \u03b3 of the particle is not large. Here we define\nthe asphericity as the following ratio:\n\u03b3=\n\nrout\nrin\n\n(17)\n\nwhere rout and rin are the circumradius and inradius of the circumsphere and insphere of the\nnonspherical particle. The circumsphere is the smallest sphere containing the particle. The\n27\n\n\finsphere is the largest sphere than can be inscribed in the particle. For a sphere, clearly the\nasphericity \u03b3 = 1. Since upper bound (14) cannot be sharp (i.e., exact) for a nonspherical\nparticle, any packing construction for a nonspherical particle whose density is close to the\nupper bound (14) is nearly optimal, if not optimal.\nIn the three-dimensional case, the upper bound (14) becomes\n\u0014\n\u0015\nvp \u03c0\nU\n\u221a ,1 .\n\u03c6max \u2264 \u03c6max = min\nvs 18\n\n(18)\n\nWe now apply this upper bound to packings of the Platonic and Archimedean solids and\ncompare the bounds to the densities of the corresponding densest lattice packings. Moreover,\nwe apply the upper bounds to superball and ellipsoid packings.\n\nA.\n\nPlatonic Solids\n\nTable III compares the density of the densest lattice packings of the Platonic solids to the\ncorresponding upper bounds on the maximal density for such packings. The large asphericity\nand lack of central symmetry of the tetrahedron is consistent with the large gap between the\nupper bound density and densest lattice packing density, and the fact that there are nonlattice packings with density appreciably greater than \u03c6Lmax . On the other hand, the central\nsymmetry of the octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron and their associated relatively\nsmall asphericities explain the corresponding small differences between \u03c6Lmax and \u03c6Umax and\nis consistent with our simulation findings that indicate that their optimal arrangements are\ntheir respective densest lattice packings.\n\nB.\n\nArchimedean Solids\n\nWe also compute the upper bound (18) for each of the 13 Archimedean solids and compare\nthem to the densities of the corresponding densest lattice packings [23, 34]. (In Appendix\nA we provide the lattice vectors for the optimal lattice packings of the Archimedean solids).\nTable IV summarizes the upper bounds on the maximal density for such packings. Not\nsurprisingly, the truncated tetrahedron (the only Archimedean solid that is not centrally\nsymmetric) has a large asphericity, implying that there are denser non-lattice packings, as\nwe explicitly identify in Section V.

Here and in the\nsubsequent paragraphs concerning ellipsoids, we only state the nontrivial part of the upper\nbound (18). For p near the sphere point (p = 1), the densest lattice packings [17] have\ndensities that lie relatively close to the corresponding upper-bound values. For example,\nfor p = 0.99, 0.98 and 0.97, \u03c6Umax = 0.745327 . . . , 0.750274 . . ., and 0.755325 . . ., respectively,\nwhich is to be compared to \u03c6Lmax = 0.740835 . . . , 0.741318 . . ., and 0.741940 . . ., respectively.\nFor p = 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03, \u03c6Umax = 0.747834 . . . , 0.755084 . . ., and 0.762233 . . ., respectively,\nwhich is to be compared to \u03c6Lmax = 0.741720 . . . , 0.742966 . . ., and 0.744218 . . ., respectively.\nThe fact that the constructed densest lattice packings of superballs have density \u03c6Lmax\nrelatively close to the upper bound value \u03c6Umax strengthens the arguments made in Ref. 17\nthat suggested that the optimal packings are in fact given by these arrangements. If the\noptimal packings around p = 1 are indeed the lattice packings, it would be surprising that\nfor other values of p a continuous deformation of the superballs would result in a transition\nfrom lattice packings to denser non-lattice packings.\n\nD.\n\nEllipsoids\n\nIn the case of ellipsoids in which the the ratio of the three semiaxes are given by 1 : \u03b1 : \u03b2\n(\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2265 1), the upper bound (18) becomes\n\u03c0\n\u03c6Umax = \u03b1\u03b2 \u221a .\n18\n\n(22)\n\nFor prolate spheroids \u03b2 = 1, and the bound becomes\n\u03c0\n\u03c6Umax = \u03b1 \u221a .\n18\n\n(23)\n\nFor oblate spheroids with \u03b1 = \u03b2 > 1, the bound is given by\n\u03c0\n\u03c6Umax = \u03b12 \u221a .\n18\n\n(24)\n\nThe upper bounds for ellipsoids generally do not work as well as those for the centrally\nsymmetric Platonic and Archimedean solids, and superballs. This is due to the fact that the\n31\n\n\fthree principle directions (axes) are not equivalent for an ellipsoid, i.e., it generally possesses\ndifferent semiaxes. Note that the three equivalent principle (orthogonal) axes (directions)\nof a centrally symmetric particle are those directions that are two-fold rotational symmetry\naxes such that the distances from the particle centroids to the particle surfaces are equal.\nIn addition, the asphericity of an ellipsoid increases linearly as the largest aspect ratio \u03b1\nincreases without limit. By contrast, the three principle directions are equivalent for the\ncentrally-symmetric Platonic and Archimedean solids as well as for superballs, for which the\nasphericity is always bounded and close to unity (see Tables III and IV). Thus, we see that\nan asphericity value close to unity is a necessary condition to have a centrally symmetric\nparticle in which the three principle directions are equivalent.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have formulated the problem of generating dense packings of nonoverlapping polyhedra within an adaptive fundamental cell subject to periodic boundary conditions as an\noptimization problem, which we call the Adaptive Shrinking Cell (ASC) scheme. The procedure allows both a sequential search of the configurational space of the particles and the\nspace of lattices via an adaptive fundamental cell that shrinks on average to obtain dense\npackings. We have applied the ASC to generate the densest known packings of the Platonic\nsolids.\nFor tetrahedra, we find a packing with density \u03c6 \u2248 0.823, which is a periodic (nonBravais lattice) packing with a complex basis. Unlike the other Platonic solids, finding\ndense packings of tetrahedra with our algorithm requires having good initial configurations.\nThe densest packing was found using 314 particles in a rhombical fundamental cell that\nis similar to that of the hexagonal close packing. As we stressed in our earlier work [27]\nand continue to confirm in this paper, it is possible that denser packings of tetrahedra will\ninvolve increasingly larger numbers of particles in the fundamental cell. In fact, the higher\ndensity found here is realized by a larger periodic packing (314 particles per cell) than\nthe one reported in Ref. [27] (72 particles per cell) with density 0.782. It is apparent the\nobtained densest known tetrahedral packing is disordered in the sense that it possesses no\nlong-range order, at least on the scale of the simulation box. This packing can be considered\nto be a disordered \"mixture\" of distorted wagon wheels and individual tetrahedra and it\n32\n\n\fis distinct from the one reported in Ref. [27] in both the arrangement of the wagon wheels\nand the extent of the distortion of the wagon wheels. Although we cannot rule out the\npossibility of the existence of denser packings involving a more ordered arrangement of\nthe wagon wheels and individual tetrahedra, it is reasonable to expect that wagon wheels\nwill be key building blocks in denser packings and should at least be slightly distorted to fill\nthe interparticle gaps in wagon-wheel clusters more efficiently, which necessarily introduces a\ncertain degree of disorder to the packing. If denser packings of tetrahedra must involve larger\nnumber of particles without long-range order, than it raises the amazing prospect that the\ndensest packings of tetrahedra might be truly disordered, due to the geometrical frustration\nassociated with the lack of central symmetry of a tetrahedron and that tetrahedra cannot\ntile space. This would be the first example of a maximally dense packing of congruent convex\nthree-dimensional particles without long-range order. However, we cannot offer definitive\nconclusions about this possibility at this stage. It is clear that in future work in the search\nfor denser packings, increasingly larger number of tetrahedra must be considered, which can\nonly be studied using greater computational resources.\nOur simulation results and rigorous upper bounds strongly suggest that the optimal\nlattice packings of the centrally symmetric Platonic solids (octahedra, dodecahedra and\nicosahedra) are indeed the densest packings of these particles, especially since these arise\nfrom a variety of initial \"dilute\" multi-particle configurations within the fundamental cell\n[40]. It is noteworthy that a different simulation procedure (an event-driven molecular\ndynamics growth algorithm with an adaptive fundamental cell) has recently been used to\ndemonstrate that the densest packings of octahedral-like superballs (which contains the\nperfect octahedron) are likely to be the optimal lattice packings [17]. Moreover, the fact that\nthe optimal lattice packing densities of certain centrally symmetric nonspherical particles,\nsuch as the Archimedean solids with central symmetry and convex superballs, are relatively\nclose to their upper bounds as well as other theoretical arguments given below suggest that\nthe densest packings of these particles may also be given by their optimal lattice packings.\nIt is crucial to stress that the nonspherical particles in this family do not deviate appreciably from a sphere, i.e., their corresponding asphericity \u03b3 is always bounded and relatively\nclose to unity, and, moreover, their three principle axes (directions) are equivalent. This is\nin contrast to the ellipsoid, which, although centrally symmetric, generally possesses three\nprinciple axes (directions) that are inequivalent and its asphericity can increase without limit\n33\n\n\fas the largest aspect ratio grows. These characteristics suggest that the densest ellipsoid\narrangements are non-lattice packings, which indeed has been verified [12].\nOur simulation results and the ensuing theoretical arguments lead to the following conjecture:\nConjecture 1: The densest packings of the centrally symmetric Platonic solids are given by\ntheir corresponding optimal lattice packings.\nWe now sketch what could be the major elements of a proof of this conjecture. In the case\nof each of the Platonic solids, face-to-face contacts are favored over vertex-to-face contacts to\nachieve higher packing densities, since the former allows the particle centroids to get closer\nto one another. Such contacting neighbor configurations around each particle reduce the\nvolume of the corresponding convex hull joining the centroids of the contacting particles,\nand the fraction of space covered by the particles within this convex hull should be increased;\nsee Fig. 13 for a two-dimensional illustration.\nTo achieve the densest packing, the fraction of space covered by the particles within the\nconvex hull should ideally be maximized and so should the number of face-to-face contacts\nper particle. Of course, this is only a local criterion that may not be consistent with the\ndensest global packing. However, it will be seen that the equivalence of the three principle directions of a centrally symmetric Platonic solid is crucial for this local optimization\ncriterion to be consistent with the globally densest packing.\nIt is noteworthy that orienting each of the particles in the packings of centrally symmetric\nPlatonic solids enable a larger number of face-to-face contacts and thus allows the maximal\nfraction of space covered by the particles within the convex hull. For example, a particle\nwith F faces, possesses F/2 families of axes that go through the centroid of the particle and\nintersect the centrally-symmetric face pairs such that the particles (in the same orientation)\nwith their centroids arranged on these axes form face-to-face contacts.\nThe requirement that the particles have the same orientation is globally consistent with a\nlattice packing. Indeed, in the optimal lattice packings of the centrally symmetric Platonic\nsolids, each particle has the maximum number of face-to-face contacts that could be obtained\nwithout violating the impenetrability condition. It is highly unlikely that such particles\npossessing three equivalent principle directions and aligned in the same direction could form\na more complicated non-lattice periodic packings with densities that are larger than the\noptimal lattice packings. Such non-lattice packings would arise to take advantage of the\n34\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFIG. 13: (color online). Illustration of our conjecture concerning the optimal packings of centrallysymmetric particles using two-dimensional octagonal packings. It is shown how different particle\norientations and arrangements affect the number of face-to-face contacts and the area of the convex\nhulls joining the centers of the neighboring particles around a central one. (a) The octagons do\nnot have the same orientation and the number of face-to-face contacts is small. (b) The octagons\nare aligned with 4 contacts per particle to form a lattice packing, but the area of the convex\nhull associated with the central particle is not minimized. (c) The octagons are aligned with 6\ncontacts per particle to form a lattice packing, but although the area of the convex hull associated\nwith the central particle is smaller than in (b), it is not minimized. (d) The octagons are aligned\nwith 6 contacts per particle to form a lattice packing, and the area of the convex hull associated\nwith the central particle is minimized. This minimization corresponds to finding the the minimal\ncircumscribing hexagon and therefore corresponds to the optimal lattice packing [41].\n\nrotational degrees of freedom. By requiring particle alignments, only translational degrees\nof freedom remain and hence optimization over these degrees of freedom would lead to the\nglobally optimal packings, which should be lattice packings. Constraining rotational degrees\nof freedom in this way in a non-lattice packing would at best lead to a local optimum in\ndensity. This conclusion is clearly supported by our simulations, which use multiple-particle\nconfigurations in the fundamental cell and only produce the optimal lattice packings.\nIn the aforementioned arguments, a key step that is difficult to prove is the observation\nthat alignment of each of the particles maximizes the number of face-to-face contacts and\nthus the fraction of space covered by the particles within the convex hull joining the centroids\nof the contacting neighbors around a central polyhedron. A rigorous verification of this step\nwould lead to the consistency of the aforementioned local and global optimization criteria.\n\n35\n\n\fIt is noteworthy that in two dimensions, our local criterion to achieve the optimal packings\nof centrally symmetric regular polygons (the two-dimensional counterparts of the centrally\nsymmetric Platonic solids) amounts to the identification of optimal neighbor configurations\nwith the maximal edge-to-edge contacts per particle such that the convex hull joining the\ncentroids of the contacting neighbors is minimal. This statement is rigorously true in two\ndimensions because it is tantamount to a theorem due to Fejes T\u00f3th [41], which states that\nthe densest packing of a centrally symmetric particle in two dimensions can be obtained by\ncircumscribing the particle with the minimal centrally symmetric hexagon, which of course\ntiles R2 . Finding the minimal circumscribing centrally symmetric hexagon is equivalent to\nfinding the minimal area convex hull joining the centroids of the six contacting particles\n(the maximal number can be obtained in two dimensions for centrally symmetric particles).\nThe fact that local optimality is consistent with the global optimality in two dimensions\n(e.g., a centrally symmetric hexagon can always tessellate the space) does not hold in three\ndimensions. Although we have presented a three-dimensional generalization of the Fejes\nT\u00f3th theorem, by replacing the minimal hexagon with the minimal convex-hull volume, as\npointed out before, it is extremely difficult to provide a rigorous proof for it.\nAlthough Conjecture 1 applies to the centrally symmetric Platonic solids, all of our arguments apply as well to each of the centrally symmetric Archimedean solids. It cannot be true\nfor the truncated tetrahedron, which is the only non-centrally symmetric Archimedean solid.\nSpecifically, it immediately follows from the results of Ref. 13 that a non-lattice packing of\ntruncated tetrahedra can be constructed based on the \"primitive Welsh\" tessellation (i.e., by\nremoving the small regular tetrahedra) that possesses the density \u03c6 = 23/24 = 0.958333 . . .,\nwhich is appreciably larger than the optimal-lattice-packing density of \u03c6Lmax = 0.680921 . . .,\nand contains two particle centroids per fundamental cell. In fact, given that the truncated\ntetrahedra cannot tile space, the density of the \"primitive Welsh\" packing of truncated tetrahedra is so large that it may be the optimal packing of such particles. The lattice vectors\nof this periodic packing are given in Appendix C.\nSince the arguments used to justify Conjecture 1 apply equally well to the 12 centrally\nsymmetric Archimedean solids, we are led to the following more general conjecture:\nConjecture 2: The densest packings of the centrally symmetric Platonic and Archimedean\nsolids are given by their corresponding optimal lattice packings.\nThe aforementioned arguments can also be extended to the case of superballs, but here\n36\n\n\fthe local principle curvatures at the contacting points should be sufficiently small so as to\nmaximize the fraction of space covered by the particles within the convex hull joining the\ncentroids of the neighbors. The central symmetry and equivalence of the three principle\ndirections of superballs means that dense packings of such objects are favored when the\nparticles are aligned, which again leads to consistency between local and global optimality. The fact that the optimal lattice packing densities of superballs is relatively close to\nthe upper-bound values, at least around the sphere point, as well as results from previous\nmolecular dynamics simulations [17] also strongly suggest that the densest packings of these\nparticles are given by their corresponding optimal lattice packings.\nIt is noteworthy that under the assumption that Conjecture 2 is valid, one has upper\nbounds that are the complete analog of (14), i.e.,\n\u0015\n\u0014\nvp C\n\u03c6 ,1 ,\n\u03c6max \u2264 min\nvc max\n\n(25)\n\nwhere vc is the volume of an appropriately chosen centrally symmetric Platonic or\nArchimedean solid and \u03c6C\nmax is the corresponding optimal density for such a solid, which according to Conjecture 2 is the optimal lattice packing. This bound will generally be sharper\nthan bound (14) because the reference optimal packing is less symmetric than the sphere.\nFor example, the conjectured bound (25) will be sharp for slightly deformed Platonic and\nArchimedean solids or nonspherical particles derived by smoothing the vertices, edges and\nfaces of polyhedra.\nOur work also naturally leads to another conjecture:\nConjecture 3: The optimal packing of any convex, congruent polyhedron without central\nsymmetry generally is not a (Bravais) lattice packing.\nIn other words, the set of such polyhedra whose optimal packing is not a lattice is overwhelmingly larger than the set whose optimal packing is a lattice. We have seen that because the\nregular tetrahedron and truncated tetrahedron lack central symmetry, dense packings of\nsuch objects favor face-to-face contacts. Such orientations immediately eliminate the possibility that lattice packings (in which particles must have the same orientations) are optimal.\nSimilarly, it is very plausible that dense packings of most convex, congruent polyhedra without central symmetry are facilitated by face-to-face contacts and hence the optimal packings\ncannot be lattices. For example, consider a square with one missing corner, i.e., an isosceles\ntriangle with a right angle (see Fig. 14). At first glance, one might surmise that if the missing\n37\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 14: (color online). Portions of two packing configurations of pentagons obtained by cutting\noff a corner (isosceles triangle with a right angle) of a square. (a) The optimal lattice packing and\n(b) a two-particle basis periodic packing that tiles the plane. Let side length of the square be 1\nand the lengths of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle be \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 1). The lattice vectors of the\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nL\noptimal lattice packing are eL\n1 = i \u2212 2 j, e2 = (1 \u2212 2 )i + (1 \u2212 \u03b2)j and the lattice vectors of the\n\nperiodic packing are eP1 = i + \u03b2j, eP2 = (1 \u2212 \u03b2)i + (2 \u2212 \u03b2)j with one particle at origin and the other\nat b1 = (1 \u2212 \u03b2)i + (1 \u2212 \u03b2)j, where i, j are the unit vectors along the two orthogonal coordinate\ndirections, coinciding with two orthogonal sides of the square. The density (covering fraction) of\nthe optimal lattice packing is \u03c6L\nmax = (1 \u2212\n\n\u03b22\n2 )/(1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b22\n4 )\n\nand the density of the periodic packing is\n\nP\n\u03c6Pmax = 1. It can be seen that for all 0 < \u03b2 < 1, \u03c6L\nmax is always smaller than \u03c6max .\n\npiece is sufficiently small, the original lattice packing should still be optimal or nearly optimal (see Fig. 14a), since lattice packings are optimal for squares. However, no matter how\nsmall the missing piece may be, a periodic packing in which the fundamental cell contains\ntwo pentagons can be constructed that tile the plane (see Fig. 14b). This is done by taking\nadvantage of the asymmetry of the particle. Thus, we see from this counterintuitive example\nthat if the particle does not possess central symmetry, it is possible to exploit its rotational\ndegrees of freedom to yield a periodic packing with a complex basis that are generally denser\nthan the optimal lattice packing. On the other hand, there are special cases where the lattice will be optimal, such as for the rhombic dodecahedron that has one corner clipped [43].\nHowever, these special cases are overwhelmed in number by those whose optimal packings\nare not lattices. If Conjecture 3 is valid, it also applies to nonspherical particles derived by\n\n38\n\n\fsmoothing the vertices, edges and faces of polyhedra provided that the particle curvature at\nface-to-face contacts is sufficiently small.\nIt should not go unnoticed that the densest packings of all of the Platonic and\nArchimedean solids reported here as well as the densest known packings of superballs\n[17] and ellipsoids [12] have densities that exceed the optimal sphere packing density\n\u221a\n\u03c6Smax = \u03c0/ 18 = 0.7408 . . .. These results are consistent with a conjecture of Ulam who\nproposed, without any justification, that the optimal density for packing congruent spheres\nis smaller than that for any other convex body [42]. The sphere is perfectly isotropic with\nan asphericity \u03b3 of unity, and therefore, as noted earlier, its rotational degrees of freedom\nare irrelevant in affecting its packing characteristics. On the other hand, each of the aforementioned convex non-spherical particles break the continuous rotational symmetry of the\nsphere and thus its broken symmetry can be exploited to yield the densest possible packings.\nHowever, broken rotational symmetry in and of itself may not be sufficient to satisfy Ulam's\nconjecture if the convex particle has a little or no symmetry.\nIt will also be interesting to determine whether our conjecture can be extended to other\npolyhedral packings. The infinite families of prisms and antiprisms [44] provide such a class\nof packings. A prism is a polyhedron having bases that are parallel, congruent polygons and\nsides that are parallelograms. An antiprism is a polyhedron having bases that are parallel,\ncongruent polygons and sides that are alternating bands of triangles. Prisms with an even\nnumber of sides and antiprisms are centrally symmetric. Although prisms and antiprisms\nare naturally grouped with the Archimedean solids (i.e., they are polyhedra in which the\nsame regular polygons appear at each vertex), they are generally much less symmetric than\neither the Platonic or Archimedean solids. Moreover, even the centrally symmetric prisms\nand antiprisms generally do not possess three equivalent directions. Thus, it is less obvious\nwhether Bravais lattices would still provide the optimal packings for these solids, except for\nprisms that tile space (e.g., hexagonal prism or rhombical prisms). In future work, it would\nbe desirable to test whether our conjecture extends to prisms and antiprisms that possess\ncentral symmetry and three equivalent directions using the ASC scheme.\nIt is worth noting that in four dimensions, the analogs of the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron are the four-dimensional regular simplex, hypercube,\ncross polytope, 120-cell and 600-cell, respectively. All of these four-dimensional polytopes\npossess central symmetry, except for the simplex [45]. While the hypercube and cross poly39\n\n\ftope tile R4 , the optimal packings of simplices are still likely to be non-lattices. Since our\nconjecture for the three-dimensional Platonic solids should still apply in four dimensions,\nthe densest packings of the 120-cell and 600-cell could be their corresponding optimal lattice\npackings. The cross polytopes for d \u2265 5 no longer tile space, and their optimal packings\nmay still be their densest lattice packings provided that d is sufficiently small. However, in\nsufficiently high dimensions, the densest lattice packings of the centrally symmetric polytopes are probably no longer optimal, since lattice packings in high dimensions are known\nto possess huge \"holes\" into which additional particles can be inserted, yielding higher packing densities with possibly non-lattice arrangements. Indeed, it has recently been argued\nthat disordered sphere packings in very high dimensions could be denser than any ordered\npacking [46].\nRecent progress in particle synthesis methods have enabled the production of a wide\nspectrum of nanoparticle shapes such as tetrahedra [47], cubes [48], icosahedra [49] and\nprisms [50]. In such applications, it would be of great interest to predict the corresponding\ncrystal structures, which might possess unusual symmetries and properties. The idea of\nincorporating collective particle motions due to the adaptive fundamental cell should still\nmake it efficient to search the desired crystal structures formed by those polyhedral nanobuilding blocks. Finally, it is worth noting that the ASC algorithm is also suitable to generate\nrandom packings of polyhedral particles. Crucial dynamical parameters of the system, such\nas the strain rate can be properly controlled to produce packings with varying degrees of\ndisorder, including the maximally random jammed ones [51]. We will explore disordered\npackings in future work.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to Henry Cohn, John Conway and Alex Jaoshvili for helpful comments\non our manuscript. S.

E 75, 051304 (2007).\n[37] The supplementary materials can be found at http://cherrypit.princeton.edu/pre-packings.html.\n[38] The fundamental cells of the initial configurations for the optimization algorithm involve\nperiodic copies of the packings listed in Table I. Specifically, if the lattice vectors of the\npackings listed in Table I are denoted by e1 , e2 and e3 , then the lattice vectors associated\n\n50\n\n\fL\nL\nwith the initial configurations are given by eL\n1 = n1 e1 , e2 = n2 e2 and e3 = n3 e3 , where\n\nn1 , n2 , n3 \u2265 1 are integers. Thus, the number of tetrahedra in the fundamental cells of the\ninitial configurations is an integral multiple, i.e., n1 \u00d7 n2 \u00d7 n3 , of that for the corresponding\npackings given in Table I. For the optimal lattice packing, n1 = n2 = n3 = 3; for the uniform\npacking, n1 = n2 = n3 = 3; for the Welsh packing, n1 = n2 = n3 = 1; for the icosahedral\npacking, n1 = n2 = n3 = 1; and for the wagon-wheels packing, n1 = n2 = 2, n3 = 1.\n[39] This bound was motivated by a question posed by Robert Connelly in May, 2005 at a Banff\nInternational Research Station Workshop entitled \"Densest Packings of Spheres,\" organized\nby K. Bezdek, H. Cohn and C. Radin. Specifically, he asked whether an upper bound on the\nmaximal density of congruent ellipsoid packings in R3 that is less than unity for any aspect\nratios of the ellipsoid could be formulated. One of us in attendance (S. T.) provided the version\nof upper bound (14) for the special case of ellipsoids. Of course, for ellipsoids, the bound (14)\nis less than unity provided that the eccentricity of the ellipsoid is sufficiently small. However,\nhere we recognize that the same type of upper bound can yield a reasonably tight upper bound\nfor other nonspherical shapes provided that the particle has a small asphericity \u03b3.\n[40] Although we cannot exclude the possibility that there exist other optimal packing particle\narrangements that possess the same density as the optimal lattice packings, it is highly unlikely\nthat those arrangements could be constructed in the same way way as the stacking variants of\nthe optimal FCC lattice packings for spheres (the so-called Barlow packings). The polyhedral\nshape of the particles does not allow them to fit snugly into the \"holes\" formed in the particle\nlayers above and below a particular layer, as in the case of spheres, and hence stackings of the\nlayers cannot result in packings with densities that are higher than that of the optimal lattice\npacking. If degenerate optimal packings exist, they cannot be of the \"Barlow\" type.\n[41] L. Fejes T\u00f3th, Regular Figures (Macmillan, New York, 1964).\n[42] M.
