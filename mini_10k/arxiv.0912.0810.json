The orientation of the graphene lattice changes from one island\nto the other. In the STM images, this rotational disorder gives rise to various superlattices with\nperiods in the nm range. We show that those superlattices are moir\u00e9 patterns (MPs) and we\ncorrelate their apparent height with the stacking at the graphene/SiC(3\u00d73) interface. The contrast\nof the MP in STM images corresponds to a small topographic modulation (by typically 0.2 \u00c5) of\nthe graphene layer. From STS measurements we find that the substrate surface presents a 1.5\neV wide bandgap encompassing the Fermi level. This substrate surface bandgap subsists below\nthe graphene plane. The tunneling spectra are spatially homogeneous on the islands within the\nsubstrate surface gap, which shows that the MPs do not impact the low energy electronic structure\nof graphene.

Moreover, suspended graphene shows\nexceptionally high carriers mobility9,10 even near room temperature11 . These features make\ngraphene an attractive material for the investigation of original physical phenomena12,13 and\nfor the development of devices such as transistors14,15 and captors16 .\nThe physical properties of free standing graphene are intimately linked to the presence\nof two equivalent carbon sublattices commonly called A and B. Usually, graphene layers are\nsupported on a substrate and the interaction between the electronic states of the substrate\nsurface and the pz orbitals of the C atoms can significantly alter the electronic structure -and\nthus the properties- of the material. This has been shown recently by angle resolved photoemission for graphene elaborated on metal surfaces where this coupling modifies the band\ndispersion close to the Dirac point17,18,19 , suppressing the \"Dirac cones\". The investigation\nof the atomic and electronic structure of the interface between graphene and the substrate is\nthus of primary importance. This is in particular the case for few layers graphene grown on\nSiC substrates, where as-grown samples are used for physical measurements7,20,21,22 , since the\ndoped graphene layers close to the interface should give the largest contribution to electrical\ntransport21 .\nFew layers graphene are obtained by high temperature treatment of the polar faces of\nSiC substrates23,24,25 . Usually commercial hexagonal (4H or 6H) substrates are used. They\nhave two different faces, the (0001) one (the Si face) and the (0001) faces (the C face). The\ninterface between the Si face and the graphene overlayer has been extensively studied in the\nlast few years. The current model for this interface is that the first graphitic layer strongly\n\u221a\n\u221a\ninteracts with the substrate, giving rise to the (6 3 \u00d7 6 3)R30\u25e6 (6R3) reconstruction26,27 .\nCovalent bonds form between Si atoms of the substrate surface and the graphene layer, which\nresults in the suppression of the Dirac cones characteristic of graphene26,28,29 . This model is\nsupported by photoemission data30 . Accordingly no graphene contrast has been detected in\nSTM images of the 6R3 reconstruction31,32,33,34 , which is usually called the \"buffer layer\".\nThe electronic structure of graphene is developed only for the second C plane26,27,28,29 , where\na band structure very similar to the Dirac cones has been observed experimentally35,36 . The\n\n2\n\n\fquestion of a possible perturbation of the electronic structure of the graphene layer due to\nan interaction with the buffer layer remains open37,38 . Nevertheless, the honeycomb contrast\nexpected for ideal graphene is observed by STM on this second C plane31,33,34,39 . Moreover\nthe analysis of the standing wave patterns indicates that the electronic chirality of graphene\nis preserved40 .\nThe interface between graphene and the C face has been less extensively studied. It has\nlong been known that the growth is quite different on the C and the Si face23 . Graphitic films\ngrown in UHV conditions on the C face exhibit some rotational disorder23,25 . This disorder\nalready exists for the first C layer30,41,42 . Interestingly, it was found using photoemission that\nthe interaction between the first C layer and the substrate was much weaker than for the Si\nface: no buffer layer is detected in core level spectroscopy30,42 and the band structure of this\nlayer30 resembles the one of graphene. The situation is however complicated by the facts that\ni) two different pristine reconstructions of the substrate -the SiC(2 \u00d7 2)C and the SiC(3 \u00d7 3)exist at the interface below the graphene layer30,41,42 and ii) that several orientations exist\nfor the graphene islands for each reconstruction, leading to different superlattices41 . A\nsystematic analysis of the interface for the two different substrate reconstructions aiming\nat understanding their atomic and electronic structure for the different orientations of the\ngraphene layer is thus needed. This is best achieved by STM, which can address each\nindividual island.\nIn a previous paper we have shown that a graphitic signal could be observed at low bias\nfor both the SiC(2 \u00d7 2)C and the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstructions, indicating a weaker coupling\nwith the substrate than on the Si face41 . A recent ab-initio calculation has shown that the\nreduced interaction in the case of the SiC(2 \u00d7 2)C reconstruction is due to a passivation of\nthe substrate surface by Si adatoms43 . The linear dispersion of the graphene bands close\nto the Dirac point is preserved, but a residual coupling with the substrate, also evidenced\nby STM, was found. In the present paper we concentrate on the graphene islands formed\non the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) interface reconstruction, which are called G 3 \u00d7 3 islands afterward,\nwhere the interaction with the substrate seems to be even smaller41 . We first analyze the\ngeometric structure of the superlattices. We show that they are moir\u00e9 patterns and we\nrelate their apparent height to the local stacking at the interface. We then analyze the\nelectronic structure of the G 3 \u00d7 3 islands compared to that of the bare substrate SiC(3 \u00d7 3)\nreconstruction. A wide surface bandgap (of width \u2248 1.5 eV) is found by STS in the electronic\n3\n\n\fstructure of the bare reconstruction, which persists below the graphene layer. The Fermi\nlevel of graphene is located in the vicinity of the top of this surface gap. In STM images\na graphene signal dominates inside the substrate surface gap, and the STS data explain\nthe high bias \"transparency\" of graphene. A comparison between STM images of G 3 \u00d7 3\nislands for a specific orientation with previous ab-initio calculations -as well as with the\ncase of the Si face- indicates that the substrate reconstruction is responsible for the weak\ngraphene-substrate interaction. Finally we show that the moir\u00e9 pattern is essentially of\ntopographic origin. It is associated with small undulations of the graphene layer. From STS,\nthese undulations do not lead to heterogeneities in the electronic structure of graphene, at\nvariance with the case of more strongly interacting systems such as graphene on Ru(0001)44 .\nFrom these data we conclude that the G 3 \u00d7 3 islands should be a system close to ideal,\nuncoupled, graphene. At present it is not clear whether the G 3 \u00d7 3 structure is present\nat the interface for few layers graphene films elaborated at high temperature in non UHV\nconditions45 . Our results indicate anyway that manipulating the atomic structure of the\nsurface can be a useful way to modify the coupling at the interface, as shown previously for\nmetal substrates46 .\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nThe sample preparation and characterization were conducted under ultrahigh vacuum.\nThe sample graphitization was performed in-situ by following the procedure presented\npreviously41 . The n doped 6H-SiC(0001) samples were first cleaned by annealing under\na Si flux at 850\u25e6 C. The already reported SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction47 was obtained by further\nannealing at 950 \u2212 1000\u25e6 C. After annealing steps at increasing temperature, a graphene coverage of less than a monolayer is finally detected by low energy electron diffraction (LEED)\nand Auger spectroscopy. At this stage, the LEED patterns show SiC(3 \u00d7 3) and SiC(2 \u00d7 2)\nspots and a ring-shaped graphitic signal with modulated intensity30,41,42 .\nThe STM and STS measurements were made at room temperature with mechanically\ncut PtIr tips. 5 samples were investigated, using more than 10 macroscopically different\ntips. The samples morphology observed by STM was similar to previous results, with the\npresence of bare SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstructed substrate domains, graphene monolayer islands on\nthe SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction (G 3 \u00d7 3) and on the SiC(2 \u00d7 2)C reconstruction (G 2 \u00d7 2) and\n4\n\n\falso few multilayer islands41,42 . The focus of this paper is the structure of G 3 \u00d7 3 islands\nand several dozens of them were observed.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nA.\n\nSuperlattices and local stacking of monolayer graphene on the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) re-\n\nconstruction\n\nSTM images show that G 3 \u00d7 3 islands present superlattices (SLs) of various periodicities\nin the nanometer range (see Fig. 1 (a)). Contrary to graphene on SiC(0001) (Si face),\ngraphene on SiC(0001) (C face) exhibits a significant rotational disorder, already from the\nfirst graphene layer. This results in a ring-shaped graphitic signal on LEED patterns (Fig.\n1 (b)). A previous STM study established that the SL period depends on the orientation\nangle of the graphene layer with respect to the substrate surface lattice41 . In this section\nwe present a more quantitative analysis of the SLs that identifies them as moir\u00e9 patterns\n(MPs).\nMoir\u00e9 patterns arise from a non linear composition of two periodic lattices48 . They appear\nas an additional periodic lattice of larger period than the two components. For example,\nMPs are observed by STM on graphite49 and few layer graphene samples with rotational\nstacking faults50 . They also show up when two lattices of different lattice parameters are\nsuperimposed as for graphene monolayer on transition metals44,51,52 . For two periodic lattices\nwith reciprocal lattice vector k1 and k2 respectively, the resulting MP is characterized by\nthe reciprocal lattice vector48,51 :\nkM = k2 \u2212 k1 .\n\n(1)\n\nIn the system we consider, the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) lattice parameter being almost 4 times bigger\nthan the one of graphene, high order spectral components have to be considered. As we\ncan see on the LEED pattern in Fig. 1 (b), first order SiC(3 \u00d7 3) spots are located far\naway from the graphitic signal. According to equation (1), moir\u00e9 patterns constructed on\nthese spots and any graphene spot would have a smaller period than the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) lattice,\nwhich cannot explain the observed SLs. SiC(1 \u00d7 1) spots can also be ruled out for similar\nreasons. From the LEED pattern of fig. 1 b), the reciprocal lattice vectors of the SiC(3 \u00d7 3)\nreconstruction most likely to lead to MPs with periods in the nanometer range are the high\n5\n\n\forder (4, 0), (3, 1), (2, 2) ones and their symmetric counterparts in the reciprocal space. Fig.\n1 (c) provides an illustration of a MP construction associated to the (2, 2) SiC(3 \u00d7 3) spot\nof the LEED pattern, for a graphene island of orientation \u03b1 with respect to the SiC surface\nlattice.\nThus, we calculated the moir\u00e9 periodicity P as a function of the graphene orientation\nangle \u03b1 with respect to the SiC surface lattice with \u03b1 ranging from 0\u25e6 to 30\u25e6 (due to the\nsymmetry of the system seen on the LEED pattern). For each of the three relevant SiC(3\u00d73)\nFourier components, we use equation (1) and P (\u03b1) = 2\u03c0/(kM (\u03b1) cos(\u03c0/6)). The three\nresulting P (\u03b1) curves are plotted in Fig. 1 (d). We have also measured moir\u00e9 periodicities\nversus graphene orientation angles on STM images of monolayer G 3 \u00d7 3 islands (such as\nFig. 1 (a)), with an accuracy of \u00b1 0.1 nm and \u00b1 1\n\n\u25e6\n\nrespectively. As represented on Fig.\n\n1 (d) , experimental data do fit very well with calculations. For a given angle, the largest\nperiod - which corresponds to the best match in reciprocal space - is generally predominant\nin the images. We also note that most studied islands exhibit an orientation angle between\n15\u25e6 and 30\u25e6 . This is consistent with the peculiar rotation angle distribution revealed by\nLEED41,42 . We will thus concentrate on these orientations in the following. To summarize,\nwe interpret superlattices on G 3 \u00d7 3 monolayer islands as high order MPs, resulting from\nthe superposition of the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) and the graphene-like lattices. Note however that the\nmoir\u00e9 interpretation is essentially geometric and that it does not give any information on\nthe nature of the interaction between graphene and its substrate. We shall consider this\npoint in section III C.\nWe now focus on the atomic structure and on the stacking for graphene islands with a\nMP constructed on the (2, 2) and (3, 1) SiC(3 \u00d7 3) Fourier components which are the most\ncommon on our samples (15\u25e6 < \u03b1 < 30\u25e6 ). As shown on Fig. 1 (d), the corresponding moir\u00e9\nperiodicity is maximum for a graphene orientation angle \u03b1 of 30\u25e6 and 13, 9\u25e6 respectively.\nLow bias STM images (see Fig. 2 (a), (b)) show that the MPs observed for angles close\nto these two values exhibit inverted contrasts: \"ball-like\" for \u03b1 close to 30\u25e6 , \"hole-like\" for\n\u03b1 close to 14\u25e6 . At the atomic scale, a well defined honeycomb pattern characteristic of\nmonolayer graphene is observed at low bias for both orientations (see Fig. 2 (a), (b)). We\npoint out that the moir\u00e9 contrast on G 3 \u00d7 3 islands shows no variations with the tip and\ntunneling conditions: bright areas remain bright at any bias and for all tips tested (see Fig.\n5).\n6\n\n\fIn order to understand the variation of the MP contrast with angle \u03b1, we studied the\nlocal stacking of the graphene and SiC(3 \u00d7 3) lattices for \u03b1 close to 30\u25e6 and 14\u25e6 . As already\nmentioned in previous papers31,32,33,41 , graphene appears transparent on high bias STM images so that the interface -the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction in the present case- becomes visible.\nConversely, atomic resolution on graphene is obtained on low bias images. Thus, stacking\ncan be observed using two different approaches: by dual bias imaging at low and high bias or\nby imaging at an intermediate tunnel bias voltage, which corresponds to a crossover between\nthese two extreme situations (to be discussed in section III B). The latter type of image is\nrepresented in Fig. 2(c) and 2(d) for islands with \u03b1 = 29\u25e6 and 15\u25e6 respectively. For this\nsample bias (VS = \u22121.65 V), the graphene and SiC(3 \u00d7 3) lattices appear simultaneously.\nSchematic reproductions of the images in Fig. 2(e) and (f) give a clear view of the local\nstacking (the same result is found from dual bias imaging). Since no established structure\nmodel for the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction exist, we represent in Fig. 2 (e), (f) the states\ndetected by STM on the substrate surface47 : filled (empty) states are represented in red\n(light-red) (dark gray and light gray in the printed version).\nIn the \u03b1 = 30\u25e6 case (Fig 2 (e)), the graphene and SiC(3 \u00d7 3) lattices are quasi commensurate. The corresponding common Wigner-Seitz cell is represented by solid lines. The\napparent height of the MP is maximum in the center of the cell and minimum on its edges.\nThese areas correspond to two different types of stacking. At the center of the cell (circled\narea), SiC(3 \u00d7 3) states are located under the center of graphene hexagons (i.e. no C atom\nis in coincidence with SiC(3 \u00d7 3) states). On the edges (dark area), all SiC(3 \u00d7 3) states\nhave C atoms or C-C bonds on top of them.\nIn the \u03b1 = 15\u25e6 case, the moir\u00e9 corrugation is inverted. The apparent height of the moir\u00e9\nis minimal at the center of the cell and maximal at its edges. Now the stacking at the center\nof the cell (circled area) is such that every SiC(3 \u00d7 3) state has C atoms or C-C bonds\ndirectly above which is similar to the stacking in the dark area of the \u03b1 \u2248 30\u25e6 case. At\nthe edges of the cell, a significant amount of SiC(3 \u00d7 3) states are located under the center\nof graphene hexagons, as for the bright regions in the \u03b1 \u2248 30\u25e6 case. Therefore, the local\nstacking of bright (high) and dark (low) areas is the same for the two kinds of MP contrast,\n\"ball-like\" (\u03b1 \u2248 30\u25e6 ) and \" hole-like\" (\u03b1 \u2248 14\u25e6 ). The apparent MP \"contrast inversion\"\narises from changes in the local stacking induced by the graphene rotation.\nIslands with \u03b1 \u2248 30\u25e6 deserve particular attention because they allow a direct comparison\n7\n\n\fwith the experimental results for the Si face and with theoretical calculations. For \u03b1 = 30\u25e6 ,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nthe graphene and the SiC(1\u00d71) lattices are (quasi)-commensurate with a 6 3\u00d76 3R(30\u25e6 )SiC (6R3) common cell (or a (13 \u00d7 13) graphene cell). This is the configuration which is\nobserved for the Si face23,24,53 , the layer orientation is imposed by the substrate and is\ntherefore the same on the whole sample. A strong interaction between the first graphitic\nlayer (\"buffer layer\") and the substrate occurs so that only the second layer shows graphene\nproperties26,27,28,29 . In particular, no honeycomb contrast characteristic of graphene has ever\nbeen observed in STM studies of the 6R3 phase of the Si face -corresponding to the first\ngraphitic layer or \"buffer layer\"- since it lacks \u03c0 states in the vicinity of the Fermi level30 .\nAdditionally, this 6R3 usually gives rise to a dominant SiC(6 \u00d7 6) superstructure in STM\nimages53 , although high resolution images reveal the actual 6R3 periodicity32 .\nA totally different situation occurs for graphene on the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction of the\n\u221a\n\u221a\nC face. For \u03b1 = 30\u25e6 , Fig. 3 (a), we actually observe a 2 3 \u00d7 2 3R(30\u25e6 ) with respect to the\nSiC(3 \u00d7 3), which corresponds to the actual 6R3 (and not SiC(6 \u00d7 6)) superstructure with\nrespect to the SiC (1 \u00d7 1). More important, the honeycomb contrast of graphene clearly\nshows up at low bias (see inset in Fig. 3). This demonstrates that the graphene states are\npresent close to the Fermi level and thus implies a comparatively much weaker interaction\nwith the substrate compared to the Si face. This weak coupling probably results from the\npresence of the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) surface reconstruction below the graphene layer. Indeed, ab-initio\ncalculations performed for a graphitic C layer on the ideal (non-reconstructed) C face for\nthis orientation (\u03b1 = 30\u25e6 ) indicate a strong bonding to the substrate27,28,29 and subsequently\nthe disappearance of the \u03c0 states at low energy, as for the Si face. This suggests that the\nSiC(3\u00d73) reconstruction efficiently passivates the substrate surface for the C face, preventing\nthe formation of chemical bonds with the graphene layer. Similar results were obtained from\nab-initio calculations for graphene monolayer on the SiC(2 \u00d7 2)C reconstruction43 , a system\nthat coexists with G 3 \u00d7 3 on the SiC(0001) graphitized surface.\nAnother observation we have made on G 3 \u00d7 3 islands for \u03b1 \u2248 30\u25e6 is that the orientation\nof the graphene layer is not locked to 30\u25e6 . To see that, we took advantage of the fact\nthat the MP orientation with respect to the SiC lattice is highly sensitive to the rotation\nangle \u03b1. Indeed, for a change by 1\u25e6 of \u03b1, the orientation of the MP changes by 13\u25e6 (for\n\u03b1 \u2248 30\u25e6 ). Thus, we could identify some slight deviations (\u2206\u03b1 < 1\u25e6 ) from the quasicommensurate (\u03b1 = 30\u25e6 ) configuration. Fig. 3 (b) provides an illustration of this effect: the\n8\n\n\fMP significantly differs from the 6R3 supercell although \u03b1 remains close to 30\u25e6 (we measure\n\u03b1 = 29 \u00b1 1\u25e6 ). The fact that such islands exist suggests that the 6R3 (quasi-commensurate)\nconfiguration does not lead to a notable energy reduction, at variance with the case of the\nSi face. This is consistent with the absence of covalent, directional bonds between graphene\nand substrate at the interface for G 3 \u00d7 3 islands.\n\nB.\n\nElectronic structure of monolayer graphene on the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction\n\nAfter these mainly structural considerations, we focus on the electronic structure of the\ngraphene overlayer and of the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction. We first compare the electronic\nstructure of the G 3 \u00d7 3 and SiC(3 \u00d7 3) phases using current imaging tunneling spectroscopy\n(CITS). This technique consists in acquiring a constant current image and an I(V) curve\nafter each of its points. For each spectrum, the feedback loop is turned off and the sample\nvoltage (VS ) is ramped between preset values. I(V) curves are then numerically differentiated\nto get dI/dV conductance curves which are -in first approximation- proportional to the local\ndensity of states (LDOS) of the sample surface. In Fig. 4, we present CITS data acquired\non a region (see insert in Fig. 4 (a)) with the bare SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstructed substrate surface\n(right) and a G 3 \u00d7 3 island (left), so that both region are probed with the same tip. Fig. 4\n(a) shows three I(V) curves, one for each type of surface, spatially averaged over the boxed\nregions (300 points each), and one for the edge of the graphene island (averaged over 15\npoints). The dI/dV spectra for the G 3 \u00d7 3 island and the bare substrate are given in Fig.\n4 (b).\nFor the bare SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction, the I(V) curve in Fig. 4 (a) displays a dramatic\nreduction of the current between VS = \u22121.4V and +0.1V. This feature is still visible although less marked- in the I(V) curve for the graphene island. The curve obtains on the\nedge of the island indicates that the lack of current at low bias does not arise from the\nelectronic structure of the tip. These observations suggest the presence of a surface bandgap\nassociated to the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction that subsists under the graphene layer. However,\na residual current related to in-gap states is detected in the surface gap of the bare SiC(3\u00d73)\nreconstruction (between VS = \u22121.4V and \u22120.5V). To further study the electronic structure\nof the G 3 \u00d7 3 island and of the bare substrate, the conductance curves presented in Fig. 4\n(b) are analysed in the following.\n9\n\n\fThe SiC(3 \u00d7 3) spectrum exhibits a region of minimum conductance ranging from VS =\n\u22121.4 V to +0.1 V. These values are only weakly dependent (within 0.2 V) of the tip and\nsample. Hence, the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction presents an asymmetric surface bandgap,\nwith the Fermi level close to the bottom of the conduction band, as expected for a ntype semiconductor. A broad structure centered around VS = \u22120.7 V is also detected. It\nis ascribed to in-gap states. An additional CITS study of the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction\nsuggests that they arise from a subsurface atomic layer (not shown). For the occupied\nstates, these observations are consistent with Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy\n(ARPES) data30 of the bare and lightly graphitized SiC(0001)(3 \u00d7 3) surface where a large\nintensity for binding energies larger than 1.5 eV and a residual emission between 0.5 eV and\n1.0 eV binding energies are detected.\nThe G 3 \u00d7 3 spectrum has similarities with the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) spectrum. In particular, the\nstructure at VS = +0.7 V (above the top of the substrate surface gap) and the rapid increase\nof conductance below the bottom of the substrate surface gap (VS \u2248 \u22121.4 V) are clearly\nobserved. These structures arise from the underlying SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction. The Fermi\nlevel of graphene (EF in Fig.4 (c)) is located close to the top of the substrate surface gap.\nInside the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) surface bandgap, an additional - though rather small - density of states\noriginating from the graphene layer is detected. In other words, outside the (bare) SiC(3\u00d73)\nsurface bandgap, the signal is dominated by the contribution of the substrate which explains\nthe transparency of graphene at high bias31,32,33,41 .\nNote that the surface bandgap of the substrate remains unchanged below the graphene\nlayer. This again suggests a weak graphene - substrate interaction since strong coupling\nwould also affect the electronic states of the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction. Moreover, for an\nextended energy range within the surface bandgap (from \u22121.4 eV to +0.1 eV) the density\nof interface states susceptible to interact with graphene states is quite small (from Fig. 4).\nThis is consistent with graphene-like atomic contrast on low bias STM images presented\nhere (Fig. 2) and in previous papers41 . Nevertheless, moir\u00e9 patterns are still visible on the\ngraphene islands at energies within the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) surface bandgap. This gives evidence for\na residual effect of the substrate. Following experiments aim at discriminating between a\ntopographic or an electronic effect for the MP contrast.\nIn Fig. 5 (a) we present a series of STM images of the same area of a G 3 \u00d7 3 island with\n\u03b1 = 16\u25e6 at various sample bias voltages. At VS = \u22122.5 V, the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction\n10\n\n\fis clearly visible while no evident graphene signal is detected. At VS = \u22121.5 V, atomic\nresolution on graphene appears, superimposed to the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) signal as in Fig. 2(c),\n2(d) and 3. For lower biases, typically from VS = \u22121.0 V to +0.2 V, we detect a well\ndefined honeycomb graphene signal and no more signal of the underlying reconstruction54\n(see VS = \u22121.0 V and VS = +10 mV panels). From VS = +0.5 V to higher biases, no\nmore evident graphene signal is visible and the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) signal reappears. Thus, atomic\nresolution on graphene is mostly achieved within the SiC(3\u00d73) surface bandgap, as expected\nsince the DOS arising from the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) is small within the surface bandgap. If we now\nconcentrate on the moir\u00e9 pattern - the signal with period P = 4.5 nm in the images of Fig.\n5 (a) - we notice that its corrugation is obviously much smaller at high biases than at low\nbiases.\nTo complete these observations, we have measured the peak-to-peak moir\u00e9 corrugation\namplitude as a function of the sample bias voltage (see graph in Fig. 5 (c)) using two different\nmethods: i) profiles laterally averaged over 0.6nm on raw images or ii) profiles taken on lowpass filtered images in order to get rid of the high frequency atomic corrugation. Both\nmethods gave the same results. The former method is illustrated in Fig. 5 (b) for a profile\ntaken on the low bias image (VS = +10 mV) of Fig. 5 (a). We stress that the measurements\nreported in Fig. 5 (c) were actually made at several spots on larger images. The uncertainty\nin the measurement is estimated to be of \u00b10.025 \u00c5 . It results from the residual contribution\nof the atomic corrugation (SiC(3\u00d73) at high bias or graphene at low bias as in Fig. 5 (b)) and\nto some inhomogeneities in the corrugation of the moir\u00e9 patterns. The data presented in Fig.\n5 (b) were acquired with different tips on two different G 3 \u00d7 3 islands (labeled \"Island 1\"\nand \"Island 2\") of approximately the same orientation: \u03b1 = 16\u25e6 , P = 4.5 nm (STM images\nin Fig. 5 (a) were obtained on \"Island 1\"). A typical SiC(3 \u00d7 3) average spectrum is also\ngiven on the graph in order to locate the substrate surface bandgap. The behavior is similar\nfor both set of measurements with the following characteristics: within the SiC(3\u00d73) surface\nbandgap, the moir\u00e9 corrugation amplitude is constant and equal to 0.25 \u00b1 0.025 \u00c5. Outside\nthe surface bandgap, when the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) contribution to the tunneling current becomes\ndominant, the corrugation dramatically decreases -or even vanishes. Other G 3 \u00d7 3 islands\nwith different orientations (including angles close to 30\u25e6 ) show similar behavior of the moir\u00e9\ncorrugation as a function of bias. These observations imply that the moir\u00e9 corrugation is\nassociated to the graphene layer and not to the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction55 . Moreover, since\n11\n\n\fthe corrugation is independent of the bias in a large voltage range spanning the SiC(3 \u00d7 3)\nsurface bandgap, it is most probably of topographic origin. The corrugation amplitude\nvaries with the moir\u00e9 period, between 0.15 \u00c5 and 0.25 \u00c5 (smaller corrugations correspond\nto moir\u00e9 patterns of smaller periods).\nFrom the above observations, the graphene-substrate distance changes by 0.2 \u00c5 from\nthe highest to the lowest areas of the moir\u00e9 pattern. To look for a possible change in the\nelectronic properties correlated to these soft \"ripples\", we have performed scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy on several islands. In Fig. 6 we present CITS results on a G 3 \u00d7 3 island with\n\u03b1 \u2248 30\u25e6 (see insert) - similar results were obtained for other values of \u03b1 between 15\u25e6 an\n30\u25e6 . The setpoint was chosen within the substrate surface bandgap (VS = \u22121.0 V) with a\nsetpoint current of 1.0 nA in order to probe essentially the graphene states. The graph shows\ntwo spectra, one corresponding to the highest regions of the moir\u00e9 pattern and the other\nto lowest regions. Both are averaged over 24 points. The spectra coincide from VS = \u22121.0\nV to +0.15 V. This demonstrates that the electronic structure of the graphene overlayer is\nhomogeneous and thus not affected by the moir\u00e9 pattern in a wide energy range spanning\nthe Fermi level (and located in the substrate surface bandgap). Note however that the\nspectroscopy measurements are conducted at room temperature and the energy resolution\nis thus limited to \u2248 0.1 eV56 . From VS = +0.2 V to +0.5 V, more signal is detected on\nthe low regions than on the high ones. This discrepancy arises from topographic effects\n(decrease in MP corrugation) discussed in connection with Fig. 5.\nAnother important question is the position of the Dirac point. Previous ARPES30 and\ntransport measurements21 assess that it is located 0.2 eV below the Fermi level. But these\ntechniques are non-local and give therefore an average value of the doping of the graphene\nlayer. Importantly, the underlying reconstruction of the substrate is not identified in the\nprobed region. STS is thus in principle the most adapted technique for answering this\nquestion. In Fig. 6, we find a rather structureless spectrum with a \"flat\" minimum ranging\nfrom VS = \u22120.2 V to 0 V. Some other spectra showed a well defined minimum located\naround VS = \u22120.25 V. However, due to a significant variability in our measurements of the\ndI/dV curves between VS = \u22120.5 V and 0 V, we refrain from giving a definite value for the\nposition of the Dirac point.\n\n12\n\n\fC.\n\nGraphene on 6H-SiC(0001)(3 \u00d7 3): an almost ideal graphene layer?\n\nFrom measurements presented in Fig. 5, we find a topographic corrugation of 0.15 \u00c5\nto 0.25 \u00c5 of the graphene monolayer while no long range topographic modulations were\nobserved on the bare SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction. The period of the graphene topographic\nmodulation is related to its orientation with respect to the substrate reconstruction and\nfollows a moir\u00e9 model (discussed in connection with Fig.1). This means that the graphene\ncorrugation is induced by the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction. More precisely, the graphene substrate distance is governed by the local stacking of the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) and the graphene\noverlayer as shown in section III A.\nSuch an effect has already been reported for graphene on transition metals. It is instructive to compare our data with a well documented case of a relatively strong coupling, such\nas graphene on Ru(0001), where the \u03c0 bands of graphene are strongly perturbed by interaction with the substrate18,19 . This system presents a moir\u00e9 pattern (P = 2.9 nm) caused by\nthe lattice mismatch between graphene and Ru. A signal with the periodicity of graphene\nis observed by STM44,52 but the contrast changes from honeycomb in the high region to\ntriangular in the low areas44,52,57 . This is at variance with the uniform honeycomb pattern\nwe observe on G 3 \u00d7 3. DFT calculations58 , surface X-ray diffraction59 , STM44,57 and core\nlevel spectroscopy60 conclude that lower areas of the graphene layer strongly bond to the\nsubstrate.\nSTS results presented for graphene on Ru(0001) in Ref. 44 are of particular relevance\nfor the purpose of our study. It shows dI/dV spectra with significant spatial variations\ncorrelated to the moir\u00e9 pattern. This finding was interpreted in Ref. 44 using a generic\nmodel where a periodic potential -with the periodicity of the MP- is applied to a flat and\nisolated graphene layer. This leads to the LDOS modulations observed by STM, which also\ncorresponds to charge inhomogeneities in the graphene layer. In Ref. 61, it was inferred\nfrom DFT calculations that the spatial variations of the STS spectra should be attributed\nto the spatially heterogeneous bonding between graphene and Ru. This is clearly different\nfrom the behavior we observe for the dI/dV spectra on G 3 \u00d7 3 (Fig. 6), and we thus\nconclude that neither charge modulation nor local (periodic) bonds formation occurs in this\nsystem, whatever the orientation angle \u03b1. Incidentally, even for graphene on SiC(0001),\nwhere the graphene overlayer (second graphitic plane) is known to be well decoupled from\n\n13\n\n\fthe substrate, spatial variations of the dI/dV spectra have been reported close to the Dirac\npoint62 . Therefore graphene on the G 3 \u00d7 3 islands may be quite close to ideal graphene,\ndue to a weak interaction with the substrate reconstruction.\nWe now briefly discuss the origin and the influence of the corrugation of the graphene\nlayer which give rise to the MP. Since strong periodic bonding to the substrate can be ruled\nout from our data, these topographic modulations probably come from a weak, possibly Van\nder Waals-like, interaction that depends on the local stacking. Note that the corrugation\nwe measure is small, typically 0.2 \u00c5 Peak to Peak (PP) for wavelengths P in the range\n2 \u2212 5 nm. The consequence of such \"ripples\" on the electronic structure of isolated graphene\nlayers has been estimated in previous papers. For a graphene layer with a modulation of\npseudo-period P 0 = 1.9 nm and an amplitude of 0.4 \u00c5 PP, DFT calculations26,27 show no\nsignificant modification of the electronic properties with respect to the flat configuration.\nIn particular, it does not open a gap at the Dirac point26 . Even on an isolated strongly\ncorrugated monolayer (1.5 \u00c5 PP for a period P \u2248 3 nm), other ab-initio calculations shows\nthat the LDOS of graphene remains linear within \u00b11 eV from the Dirac point in the high\n(and low) regions61 . Thus we believe that the small topographic corrugation we observe\nshould have only a limited effect on the electronic structure of graphene close to the Dirac\npoint for G 3 \u00d7 3 islands. However, experiments with an improved resolution should be\nperformed to search for -or to rule out- a possible influence of the superperiod (MP) on the\nband structure of graphene63,64 .\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have investigated by STM and STS graphene monolayer islands grown under UHV on\nthe SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction of the 6H-SiC(0001) surface. These islands present different\norientations with respect to the substrate. From STM topographic images with atomic resolution, we find that the various superstructures with periods in the nm range observed on\nthe islands can be interpreted as moir\u00e9 patterns arising from the composition of graphene\nand high order SiC(3 \u00d7 3) lattice Fourier components. We show that the moir\u00e9 contrast\ncorresponds to topographic modulations in the graphene layer of typically 0.2 \u00c5. The local graphene-substrate stacking in the low and high regions of the moir\u00e9 pattern could be\nobtained using the transparency of the graphene in high-bias images. Our STS study of\n14\n\n\fthe SiC(3 \u00d7 3) substrate reconstruction reveals a surface bandgap (typically ranging from\n-1.4 eV to +0.1 eV) that persists under the graphene monolayer. This characteristic explains the variations with sample bias voltage of the graphene/substrate signal ratio for\nSTM topographic images and for STS. Further STS measurements show that the electronic\nstructure is spatially homogeneous for any orientation of the graphene layer which indicates\na weak graphene substrate interaction. This is confirmed by the absence of preferential\ngraphene orientations even for an almost commensurate configuration (\u03b1 \u2248 30\u25e6 ). The weak\ninteraction is achieved thanks to the surface reconstruction that efficiently passivates the\nSiC substrate since ab initio calculations for a bulk-truncated SiC(0001) surface have predicted strong interaction and covalent bonds formation between the graphene layer and the\nsubstrate27,28,29 . This suggests that the graphene-substrate coupling can be tuned using\npost-treatments that alter the substrate surface reconstruction. Finally, in an energy range\nof \u00b1100 meV spanning the Fermi energy, very few substrate interface states are susceptible\nto couple with graphene states which makes the graphene monolayer on SiC(3 \u00d7 3) a nearly\nideal system for investigating low energy excitations.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the French ANR (\"GraphSiC\" project N\u25e6 ANR-07-BLAN0161) and by the R\u00e9gion Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes (\"Cible07\" and \"Cible08\"programs).

Sample bias: \u22122.5 V. (b) LEED pattern of the\nsample, primary energy: 78 eV. Circles indicate first order SiC(1 \u00d7 1) and SiC(3 \u00d7 3) spots. The\nrelevant high order SiC(3 \u00d7 3) spots close to the graphitic ring-shaped signal are indicated by\narrows and their coordinates are given. (c) Schematic picture of the LEED pattern in (b). The\ndashed curve stands for the graphitic signal. The dashed arrow is the reciprocal lattice vector\nthat corresponds to a graphene layer rotated by an angle \u03b1 with respect to the SiC(1 \u00d7 1) surface.\nThe dotted one corresponds to the (2, 2) reciprocal vector of the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction. The\nreciprocal lattice vector of the moir\u00e9 pattern kM (\u03b1) constructed on these vectors is represented by\na solid vector. (d) The calculated moir\u00e9 periods P (\u03b1) for (4,0), (3,1) and (2,2) SiC(3\u00d73) reciprocal\nlattice vectors are represented in dotted, solid and dashed line respectively. Triangles correspond\nto measurements on STM images.\n\n19\n\n\fFIG. 2: (Color online) (a), (b): 8 \u00d7 8 nm2 STM images of G 3 \u00d7 3 islands with atomic resolution\non the graphene layer. Two different moir\u00e9 patterns are observed: (a) shows a superstructure with\n\"ball-like\" contrast (P= 2.9 nm), typical of a moir\u00e9 pattern constructed on the (2, 2) SiC(3 \u00d7 3)\nFourier component. (b) shows a superstructure with \"hole-like\" contrast (P= 3.5 nm), typical of\na moir\u00e9 pattern constructed on the (3, 1) SiC(3 \u00d7 3) Fourier component. (c), (d): 5 \u00d7 5 nm2 STM\nimages of two other G 3 \u00d7 3 islands showing the same type of moir\u00e9 pattern as (a) and (b) resp.\n((c) P= 2.9 nm (d) P= 4.7 nm). The sample bias is chosen so that both graphene and SiC(3 \u00d7 3)\nlattices are detected and their stacking is thus visible. (e), (f): Schematic representations of the\nstacking of the graphene atoms on the substrate reconstruction deduced from images (c) and (d)\nrespectively (the link between the STM images and the schematics is indicated by arrows). On\n(e), the Wigner-Seitz (pseudo) common cell is represented in solid line. On both illustrations, the\ndotted circle separates regions of the moir\u00e9 cell with different types of stacking.\n\n20\n\n\fFIG. 3: (Color online) 8 \u00d7 8 nm2 STM images of (a) an \u03b1 = 30\u25e6 G 3 \u00d7 3 island; sample bias:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u22121.5 V.

(b) an \u03b1 = 29\u25e6 G 3\u00d73 island; sample bias: \u22121.65 V. The SiC(6 3\u00d76 3)R30\u25e6\ncell represented by dashed lines clearly does not coincide with the moir\u00e9 pseudo unit cell represented\nby solid lines.\n\n21\n\n\fFIG. 4: (Color online) (a) Inset: 20 \u00d7 20 nm2 STM image of a region with the bare SiC(3 \u00d7 3)\nreconstruction (right side) and a G 3 \u00d7 3 island (left side). Sample bias: \u22122.5 V. The I(V) curves\nare spatially averaged over the boxed regions (300 points) on the bare SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction\n(gray line) and on the G 3\u00d73 island (black line) and over 15 points of the island edge (dashed line).\nFor STS measurements: Setpoint voltage: \u22122.5 V; Setpoint current: 1.0 nA. (b) Corresponding\ndI/dV curves for the G 3 \u00d7 3 island (black line) and the bare SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction (gray line).\n\n22\n\n\fFIG. 5: (Color online) (a) A series of 8 \u00d7 6 nm2 STM images taken at the same spot of a G 3 \u00d7 3\nisland (\u03b1 = 16\u25e6 , P = 4.5 nm) at various sample biases (VS )(Common height range \u2206Z = 1\u00c5). The\nrelative amplitude of the signals arising from the SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction and from the graphene\nlayer changes with sample bias. (b) Laterally averaged profile taken over the boxed region in (a)\nfor VS = +10mV. (c) The peak-to-peak moir\u00e9 corrugation amplitude as a function of the sample\nbias voltage, on two similar G 3 \u00d7 3 islands (\u03b1 = 16\u25e6 , P = 4.5nm) of two different samples obtained\nwith different tips. The island referred to as \"island 1\" is the island presented in (a). A dI/dV\ncurve acquired on the bare SiC(3 \u00d7 3) reconstruction is also represented on the graph (solid line)\nin order to locate the substrate surface bandgap. The moir\u00e9 corrugation and the LDOS of the\nsubstrate show complementary behaviors.\n\n23\n\n\fFIG. 6:\n\n(Color online) Inset: 10 \u00d7 10 nm2 STM image of a G 3 \u00d7 3 island presenting a \"ball-\n\nlike\" moir\u00e9 contrast. (\u03b1 = 28\u25e6 , P = 2.9 nm). Sample bias: \u22121.0 V. dI/dV curves are spatially\naveraged on 24 points of highest topographic regions (black) and of lowest topographic regions\n(gray). Setpoint voltage: \u22121.0 V; Setpoint current: 1.0 nA. No spatial variation in the electronic\nstructure of graphene is observed in the voltage range [\u22121.0 V, +0.15 V].\n\n24\n\n\f"}
