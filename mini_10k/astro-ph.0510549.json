This later\none indicates a Big Crunch.\nKey words: gravitation \u2013 relativity \u2013 cosmology \u2013 dark energy.\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe idea of variability of G originated with the work of Dirac\n(1937) who for the first time drew the attention of the scientific community towards the possibility of a time-dependent gravitational constant in the context of a cosmological model. Afterwards, cosmological theories like Brans-Dicke theory (1961),\nHoyle-Narlikar theory (1972) and the theory of Dirac (1973) himself supported the idea of a time-decreasing gravitational constant.\nSince, in the classical form of the general relativity theory G should\nremain constant, then the theories concerned with the variation of\nG must be, to some extent, consistent with relativity theory. The\nlast three theories mentioned above are reconcilable with the theory of General Relativity from the viewpoint of the perihelion advancement of Mercury and the bending of star light. The theory of\na expanding Universe also supports the idea of a time-dependent\n(\u0120/G = \u03c3H0 , where HO is the Hubble parameter and \u03c3 is a\ndimensionless parameter depending on the gravitational theory as\nwell as on the particular cosmological model) gravitational constant\n(Will, 1987). After the emergence of superstring theory, in which G\nis considered as a dynamical quantity (Marciano 1984), a resurrection of the idea of an evolving G occurred. It has been shown that a\nscale-dependent G can represent the dark matter (Goldman 1992).\nAlso, there remain some scale-wise discrepancies in the value of\nthe Hubble parameter. These discrepancies can be removed if G\nis considered as a variable quantity (Bertolami et al. 1993). Recently, S\u0306tefanc\u0306i\u0107 (2004) has considered a phantom energy model\nwith time-varying G in which exchange of energy and momentum\nbetween vacuum and non-relativistic matter (or radiation) occur\n\u03bc\u03bd\nin such a way that the energy-momentum tensors T\u039b\u03bc\u03bd and Tm\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\nare not separately conserved, but as a whole T\n= T\u039b + Tm\nis conserved. Variability of G is also supported by observational\n\nresults coming up from Lunar Laser Ranging (Turyshev et al.\n2003), spinning rate of pulsars (Arzoumanian 1995; Kaspi, Taylor\n& Ryba 1994; Stairs 2003) Viking Lander (Hellings 1987; Reasemberg 1983), distant Type Ia supernova observation (Gaztanaga et al.\n2002), Helioseismological data (Guenther et al. 1998), white dwarf\nG117-B15A (Biesiada & Malec 2004; Benvenuto et al. 2004) etc.\nOn the other hand, instead of a cosmological constant \u039b, the\nrecent trend of searching the nature of dark energy, the driving\nforce for accelerating the Universe, is to select a \u039b-model of phenomenological character. Recently, the equivalent relationship of\nthree kinematical models of \u039b, viz. \u039b \u223c (\u0227/a)2 , \u039b \u223c \u00e4/a and\n\u039b \u223c \u03c1 have been shown by us (Ray & Mukhopadhyay 2004) within\nthe framework of constant G. Since the idea of time-dependent G is\nsupported by various theories and observations, so it is quite natural to investigate the behaviour of some of the \u039b-models mentioned\nabove when G is a function of time. This is the motivation behind\nthe present work.\nHowever, it can be stated that invariant property of \u039b under\nLorentz transformation is not satisfied for arbitrary systems, e.g.,\nmaterial systems and radiation. In this connection it have shown\n(Gliner 1965; Majernik 2001) that the energy density of vacuum\nrepresents a scalar function of the four-dimensional space-time coordinates so that it satisfies the Lorentz symmetry. We would also\nlike to mention here that Vishwakarma (2001) has considered a particular Ricci-symmetry under the framework of general relativity\nwhich is the contracted Ricci-collineation along the fluid flow vector and shows that this symmetry does demand Lambda to be a\nfunction of time (and space, in general).\nIn favour of Lambda-decay scenario, irrespective of whether\nthey come from extended theories of gravity or phenomenological considerations, it is argued that (i) they have been shown to\naddress a number of pressing problems in cosmology; (ii) many\n\n\f2\n\nRay & Mukhopadhyay\n\nare independently motivated, e.g., by dimensional arguments, or as\nlimiting cases of more complicated theories; (iii) most are simple\nenough that meaningful conclusions can be drawn about their viability and (iv) successful implementation would point toward the\neventual Lagrangian formulation or a more complete theory (Overduin & Cooperstock 1998).\nUnder this background the paper is organized as follows: Sec.\n2 deals with the solution of the field equations for two different\nmodels (viz. \u039b \u223c (\u0227/a)2 , \u039b \u223c \u00e4/a) of \u039b while amount of variations of G, calculated on the basis of different theories as well as\nobservations are scrutinized in Sec. 3. Comparison of the present\nmodels with various observational and theoretical results are done\nin Sec. 4 and conclusions are summarized in Sec. 5.\n\n2.1 Model with \u039b \u223c (\u0227/a)2\nBy the use of \u039b = 3\u03b1 a\u0227\nwe get from equation (7)\n4\u03c0G\u03c1 =\n\n\u00012\n\n= 3\u03b1H 2 , where \u03b1 is a free parameter,\n\n3(1 \u2212 \u03b1) 2\nH .\n2\n\n(8)\n\nFrom equation (4) using (6), one can obtain\n3(H 2 + \u1e22) = \u22124\u03c0G\u03c1(1 + 3\u03c9) + 3\u03b1H 2\n\n(9)\n\nwhich by the use of equation (8) takes the form\n\u1e22 = \u2212\n\n3(1 \u2212 \u03b1)(1 + \u03c9) 2\nH .\n2\n\n(10)\n\nIntegrating the above equation we have\n\u0227\n2\n=H=\n.\na\n3(1 \u2212 \u03b1)(1 + \u03c9)t\n2 FIELD EQUATIONS AND THEIR SOLUTIONS\n\nIntegrating it further one gets\n\nThe Einstein field equations\nRij \u2212\n\n1 ij\n\u039b ij\nRg = \u22128\u03c0G T ij \u2212\ng\n2\n8\u03c0G\n\nh\n\n2\n\na(t) = C2 t 3(1\u2212\u03b1)(1+\u03c9) ,\n\ni\n\n(1)\n\n(where \u039b is the time-dependent cosmological term and the velocity\nof light in vacuum, c = 1 in relativistic units) for the spherically\nsymmetric Friedmann-Lema\u00eetre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a(t)2\n\n\u0014\n\ndr 2\n+ r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )\n1 \u2212 kr 2\n\n\u0015\n\n(2)\n\nyield respectively the Friedmann and Raychaudhuri equations in\nthe following forms\n\n\u0010 \u00112\n\n\u0227\n3\na\n\n= 8\u03c0G\u03c1 + \u039b,\n\n\u00e4\n3 = \u22124\u03c0G(\u03c1 + 3p) + \u039b.\na\n\n\u0227\n=0\na\n\n(13)\n\n\u039b(t) =\n\n4\u03b1\nt2\u03b1/(1\u2212\u03b1) t\u22122 ,\n3(1 \u2212 \u03b1)(1 + \u03c9)2\n\n(14)\n\nG(t) =\n\n1\nt2\u03b1/(1\u2212\u03b1)\n6C4 \u03c0(1 \u2212 \u03b1)2 (1 + \u03c9)2\n\n(15)\n\nwhere C4 is the another constant of integration and is given by\n\n(5)\n\nC4 = C3 C2 \u221231+\u03b1 .\n\n(16)\n\nAgain, we observe that equation (14) is also represents exactly\nthe same expression as in the case of our previous work (Ray &\nMukhopadhyay 2004). This means that time variation of G does\nnot affect the scale factor as well as the cosmological parameter.\nFrom the equation (15) it is easy to obtain\n2\u03b1 \u22121\n\u0120\n=\nt .\nG\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\n(17)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the equation of state parameter which is, in general, a\nfunction of time, scale factor or redshift. However, sometimes it\nis convenient to consider \u03c9 as a constant quantity because current\nobservational data has limited power to distinguish between a time\nvarying and constant equation of state (Kujat et al. 2002; Bartelmann et al. 2005). Some useful limits on \u03c9 came from SNIa data,\n\u22121.67 < \u03c9 < \u22120.62 (Knop et al. 2003) whereas refined values\nwere indicated by the combined SNIa data with CMB anisotropy\nand galaxy clustering statistics which is \u22121.33 < \u03c9 < \u22120.79\n(Tegmark et al. 2004). Since, \u0227/a = H then from equation (3) we\nget\n4\u03c0G\u03c1 =\n\n\u03c1(t) = C4 t\u22122/(1\u2212\u03b1) .\n\n(4)\n\nwhereas the time variable-\u039b and G are governed by the dynamical\ncondition \u039b\u0307 = \u22128\u03c0 \u0120\u03c1.\nThe barotropic equation of state is\np = \u03c9\u03c1\n\n(12)\n\nwhere C2 is integration constant.\nIt is interesting to note that equation (12) is the same expression for a(t) as obtained by us (Ray & Mukhopadhyay 2004) for\nthe same \u039b-model with constant G.\nAgain, using equation (12) we get the solution set for the\nmatter-energy density, cosmological parameter and gravitational\nparameter respectively as\n\n(3)\n\nwhere a = a(t) is the scale factor of the Universe and k, the curvature constant is taken to be zero for the flat Universe.\nThe energy conservation law, as usual, is given by\n\u03c1\u0307 + 3(p + \u03c1)\n\n(11)\n\n1\n(3H 2 \u2212 \u039b).\n2\n\n(7)\n\n2.2 Model with \u039b \u223c\n\n\u00e4\na\n\nLet us put \u039b = \u03b2 \u00e4a = \u03b2(H 2 + \u1e22), where \u03b2 is a constant.

So, for this\nmodel also the scale factor and the cosmological parameter remain\nunaffected by time variation of G.\n\n2.3 Comparison with other models\nFrom equation (25), in a similar way as in the previous case, we\nhave\n\u0120\n\u03b2\u03c9 + \u03b2 + 6\u03c9 \u22121\n=\nt .\nG\n(\u03b2 \u2212 3)(1 + \u03c9)\n\n(26)\n\nNow, using the expression for H from equation (11), equation (17)\ncan be written as\n\u0120\n= 3\u03b1(1 + \u03c9)H.\n(27)\nG\nSimilarly, putting the expression for H from equation (21), equation (26) can be written as\n\u0120\n\u03b2\u03c9 + \u03b2 + 6\u03c9\n=\nH.\nG\n(\u03b2\u03c9 + \u03b2 \u2212 2)\n\n(28)\n\nRecently, considering a time-dependent growing cosmological energy density of the form\n\u03c1\u039b = \u03c1\u039b0\n\n\u0010 a \u0011\u22123(1+\u03b7)\na0\n\n(29)\n\nS\u0306tefanc\u0306i\u0107 (2004) has arrived at the expression for \u0120/G at the\npresent era as\n\u0120\n= 3(1 + \u03b7)\u03a90\u039b H0 .\nG\n\n(30)\n\nIf we compare equation (27) with equation (21) of S\u0306tefanc\u0306i\u0107 (2004),\nthen remembering that for the present era \u03a90\u039b = 2/3, we get for\ndust\n3\u03b1 \u2212 2\n\u03b7=\n.\n(31)\n2\nSimilarly, comparing equation (28) with equation (21) of S\u0306tefanc\u0306i\u0107\n(2004), for dust case, we get\n\u03b7=\n\n4\u2212\u03b2\n.\n2(\u03b2 \u2212 2)\n\n3\n\n(32)\n\n3\u03b1 =\n\n\u03b2\n= 2(\u03b7 + 1).\n\u03b2\u22122\n\n(33)\n\nEquation (33) is interesting, since it inter-relates the parameter \u03b7 of\na phantom energy (\u03c9 < \u22121) model with \u03b1 and \u03b2, the parameters\nof our model with dust (\u03c9 = 0) case. Here, for a repulsive \u039b the\nconstraint on \u03b1 is \u03b1 > 0.\n\n3 PRESENT STATUS FOR THE VARIABLE-G MODELS\nThe Large Number Hypothesis (LNH) of Dirac prompted him not\nto admit the variability of the fundamental constants involved in\natomic physics. Instead he thought of a possible change in G which,\nin turn, led him to the differential equation (Cetto, Pe\u00f1a & Santos\n1986)\nG(t) = k1 H(t) = k2 [H(t)]3/2 [\u03c1(t)]\u22121/2\n\n(34)\n\nwhere k1 and k2 are constants.\nFrom the above equation Dirac obtained, G(t) \u223c t\u22121 . All\nthe three variants (early Dirac, additive creation and multiplicative\ncreation) tells us that \u0120/G should be inversely proportional to t.\nAccording to Brans-Dicke theory (1961), G should vary inversely with time since according to that theory the scalar field \u03c6(t)\nis time increasing and G(t) \u221d [\u03c6(t)]\u22121 . Dyson (1972,1978) proposed that variation of G should be of the order of H, the Hubble\nparameter. Since, H \u221d t\u22121 , then it is clear that G should decrease\nas t\u22121 .\nComing to the amount of variation of G, we find that, relying on the data provided by three distant quasars of red shift,\nz \u223c 3.5 in favour of an increasing fine-structure constant \u03b1 (Murphy et al. 2002; Webb et al. 2001) and taking the present age of\nthe Universe as 14 Gyr, it has been estimated (Lor\u00e9n-Aguilar et al.\n2003) that \u0120/G \u223c +10\u221215 yr\u22121 for Kaluza-Klein and EinsteinYang-Mills theories whereas it is of the order of 10\u221213 yr\u22121 for\nRandall-Sundrum theory. The data provided by the binary pulsar\nPSR 1913+16, is a very reliable upper bound (Damour et al. 1988),\nviz.,\n\u0120\n<0\n(35)\nG\nThe spinning-down rates of pulsars PSR B0655 + 64 (Goldman\n1992) and PSR J2019 + 2425 (Arzoumanian 1995; Stairs 2003)\nprovide respectively the constraint\n\u2212 (1.10 \u00b1 1.07) \u00d7 10\u221211 yr \u22121 <\n\n\u0120\n6 (2.2 \u2212 5.5) \u00d7 10\u221211 yr \u22121\nG\n\n(36)\n\nand\n\u0120\n6 (1.4 \u2212 3.2) \u00d7 10\u221211 yr \u22121 .\nG\n\n(37)\n\nThe range of \u0120/G provided by the Helioseismological data (Guenther et al. 1998) is considered as the best upper bound and is given\nby\n\u0120\n< 0.\n(38)\nG\nData provided by observations of Type Ia supernova (Riess 1998;\nPerlmutter 1999) gives the best upper bound of the variation of G\nat cosmological ranges as (Gaztanaga et al. 2002)\n\u2212 1.60 \u00d7 10\u221212 yr \u22121 <\n\n\u2212 10\u221211 yr \u22121 6\n\n\u0120\n< 0 at z \u2243 0.5.\nG\n\n(39)\n\n\f4\n\nRay & Mukhopadhyay\n\nThe present cosmological scenario tells us that we are living in an\nexpanding, flat and accelerating Universe dominated by dark energy while the remaining one-third is contributed by matter. So, if\nwe choose \u03a9m = 0.3 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, then the estimated range of\nvariation of \u0120/G comes out as (Lor\u00e9n-Aguilar 2003)\n\u2212 1.40 \u00d7 10\u221211 yr \u22121\n\n\u0120\n< +2.6 \u00d7 10\u221211 yr \u22121 .\n<\nG\n\n(40)\n\nVery recently, using the data provided by the pulsating white dwarf\nstar G117-B15A the astereoseismological bound on \u0120/G is found\n(Benvenuto et al. 2004) to be\n\u2212 2.50 \u00d7 10\u221210 yr \u22121 6\n\n\u0120\n6 +4.0 \u00d7 10\u221210 yr \u22121\nG\n\n(41)\n\nwhile using the same star Biesiada and Malec (2004) has inferred\nthat\n\u0120\n6 +4.10 \u00d7 10\u221211 yr \u22121 .\nG\n\n(42)\n\nOn the other hand, using Big Bang Nucleosynthesis another recent estimate of variation of G has been obtained (Copi, Davies &\nKrauss 2004) as\n\u2212 4.0 \u00d7 10\u221213 yr \u22121 <\n\n\u0120\n< +3.0 \u00d7 10\u221213 yr \u22121 .\nG\n\n(43)\n\nSome other estimates of the probable range of variation of G can be\nobtained from various other sources such as Lunar Laser Ranging\n(Turyshev et al. 2003), Viking Lander (Hellings 1987; Resemberg\n1983), lunar occultation (Van Flandern 1975), lunar tidal acceleration (Van Flandern 1975) etc. Some theoretical models (Blake\n1978; Faulkner 1976) also provide estimates of \u0120/G. Various\nranges of \u0120/G are listed in Table 1 and 2.\n\n4 COMPARISON OF PRESENT MODELS WITH\nOBSERVATIONS\nEquations (17) and (26) provide us an opportunity for fitting the\n\u039b \u223c (\u0227/a)2 and \u039b \u223c \u00e4/a models respectively with the values\nof \u0120/G obtained from various sources by proper tuning of \u03b1 and\n\u03b2, the parameters of the two models mentioned above. Assuming\nthe present age of the Universe as 14 Gyr, values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 corresponding to different values of \u0120/G are listed in Table 1. From\nthis Table 1 it is evident that most of the values of \u03b1 are negative\nwhile those of \u03b2 are positive. Now, a negative \u03b1 means an attractive \u039b which does not match with the present status of this cosmological parameter. However, equation (17) shows that values of\n\u0120/G \u223c 10\u221211 yr \u22121 can be obtained if we choose any value of\n\u03b1 > 1. For instance, if we set \u03b1 = 15, then assuming t0 = 14 Gyr,\nwe get the value of \u0120/G as \u221215 \u00d7 10\u221211 yr \u22121 which fits well with\nthe value of \u0120/G for Early Dirac theory (Blake 1978). Coming to\nthe case of \u039b \u223c \u00e4/a model we find that most of the tuned values of\n\u03b2 are positive which corresponds to a repulsive \u039b. Hence, \u039b \u223c \u00e4/a\nmodel can be fitted more easily with various ranges of \u0120/G than\nthat of \u039b \u223c (\u0227/a)2 model.\nAlso, Table 1 shows that although majority of the values of\n\u0120/G are negative, but in some cases values of \u0120/G can be found\npositive as well. Now, a negative \u0120/G implies a time-decreasing\nG. This means that by combined effect of a decreasing G and repulsive \u039b the Universe will go on accelerating for ever. On the other\nhand, a positive \u0120/G means G is growing with time. Since, \u039b is\na time-decreasing parameter so in future a time-increasing G may\n\novercome the effect of repulsive \u039b. In that case, the possibility of a\n'Big Crunch' cannot be ruled out.\n\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nIn the present work selecting two different kinematical models of\ndark energy and considering the gravitational constant G as a function of time it has been possible to solve Friedmann and Raychaudhuri equations for a(t), \u03c1(t), \u039b(t) and G(t). Comparing the expressions for \u0120/G for both the models with those of various ranges of\n\u0120/G obtained from observations as well as from theoretical consideration, it is shown that the parameters of the two \u039b-models presented here can be tuned in most of the cases to match with the\nvalues of \u0120/G obtained from various sources. It is worthwhile to\nmention here that all the values of \u0120/G listed in the Table 1 come\nfrom the consideration that G \u223c t\u22121 . But in the work of Milne\n(1935) G directly varies with t. Recently, Belinchon (2002), starting from Dirac's LNH, through dimensional analysis has arrived at\nthe same result of Milne (1935), viz., G \u223c t which obviously is in\ncontradiction to Dirac's result. It should be mentioned that in the\npresent investigation also G does not vary inversely with t as far as\nthe model \u039b \u223c \u03c1 is concerned. It has been observed by the present\nauthors that for \u039b \u223c \u03c1 model, G varies as t2 . This time variation\nof G is different from that of Dirac (1937) and Milne (1935), and\ntherefore needs further investigation. Finally, it is to be noted that\nthe expressions for a(t) and \u039b(t) for both the models considered\nhere maintain the same form irrespective of the constancy or variability of G.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nOne of the authors (SR) is thankful to the authority of InterUniversity Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pune, India,\nfor providing Associateship programme under which a part of this\nwork was carried out.\n\nREFERENCES\nArzoumanian Z., 1995, Ph.
