The existence of universal unfoldings of certain germs of meromorphic connections is established. This is used to prove a general construction theorem for Frobenius manifolds. A particular case is Dubrovin's\ntheorem on semisimple Frobenius manifolds. Another special case starts\nwith variations of Hodge structures. This case is used to compare two constructions of Frobenius manifolds, the one in singularity theory and the\nBarannikov\u2013Kontsevich construction. For homogeneous polynomials which\ngive Calabi\u2013Yau hypersurfaces certain Frobenius submanifolds in both constructions are isomorphic.\n\n1. Introduction\nf be a complex manifold. A structure of a Frobenius manifold on M\nf\nLet M\ndefined by B. Dubrovin consists of several pieces of data of which the most\nf represented by a subsheaf\nimportant are: (a) the choice of a flat structure on M\nf\nof flat vector fields TM\nf ; (b) a\nf of the sheaf of holomorphic vector fields TM\ncommutative and associative OM\nf -bilinear multiplication \u25e6 on TM\nf.\n(0)\nLet \u2207 be the unique torsionless holomorphic connection on the holomorf with kernel T f . Then the axiom connecting (a) and\nphic tangent bundle T M\nf\nM\n(0)\n\n(b) is the following requirement: \u2207z,X := \u2207X \u2212 1z X\u25e6 is a pencil (with paf, where X \u2208 T f . It was called the first\nrameter z) of flat connections on M\nM\nstructure connection in [Man2]. We use here its more sophisticated version:\ncf. lemma 4.4 and theorem 4.2.\nAdditional pieces of data include a flat holomorphic metric g, a flat identity\nvector field e for \u25e6, and an Euler field E: see definition 4.3 below for the\ncomplete list of their properties and interrelations.\nThree general constructions of Frobenius manifolds are known: K. Saito's\nFrobenius structures on unfolding spaces of singularities; quantum cohomology (physicists' A-models); and Frobenius structures on the extended moduli\nspaces of Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds (Barannikov\u2013Kontsevich construction, considerably generalized in [Ba1][Ba2], physicists' B-models).\nSome of the important issues of this theory require identification of Frobenius\nmanifolds obtained by different constructions. The famous Mirror conjecture\nof Candelas et al. belongs to this class; it stimulated much of research.\nA general strategy for establishing such an isomorphism consists in showing that two Frobenius manifolds to be compared are determined by a more\nf is\nrestricted set of data, and then identifying these data. For example, if M\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCLAUS HERTLING AND YURI MANIN\n\nendowed with a point 0 at which \u25e6 is semisimple and E\u25e6 has a simple spectrum, then a finite number of numbers suffices in order to reconstruct the\nf, 0). This is a result of Dubrovin [Du, Lecture 3].\nwhole Frobenius germ (M\nGenerally, however, this is not true; in particular, A- and B-models fail to\nsatisfy the semisimplicity restriction.\nf the\nIn this case it may happen that for an appropriate submanifold M \u2282 M\nf M endowed with the restriction of the structure connecrestriction H := T M|\ntion and some additional remnants of Frobenius structure (\"initial conditions\")\nf uniquely. A statement of\ncarry sufficient information in order to reconstruct M\nthis kind will be especially useful if one can ensure that arbitrary initial conditions of a given type come from a Frobenius structure (\"strong reconstruction\ntheorem\").\nOne of the main results of this paper (theorem 4.5) consists in exhibiting such\na set of initial data (see definition 4.1 (b)). A special case of this result having\ndirect applications is the theorem 5.6 which shows that one can construct a\nunique Frobenius manifold from any variation of Hodge filtrations over M\nand an opposite filtration assuming that a certain condition which we call\nH 2 -generation holds (definition 5.3).\nA prototype of theorem 5.6 is the first reconstruction theorem in [KM, Theorem 3.1]. The uniqueness statement in 5.6 is essentially that of [KM]. It\nwas already used in [Ba1, Theorem 6.5]. The existence is the new part. The\nmore general theorem 4.5 is applicable to the germs of semisimple Frobenius\nf 0) mentioned above as well; in this case M is the marked point,\nmanifolds (M,\nand one recovers Dubrovin's result.\nThe initial datum on M can be reformulated as a meromorphic connection\non a bundle on P1 \u00d7 M with a logarithmic pole along {\u221e} \u00d7 M and a pole of\nPoincar\u00e9 rank 1 along {0} \u00d7 M. So theorem 4.5 gives a recipe for constructing\nFrobenius manifolds: One has to construct such connections.\nThe proof of theorem 4.5 relies on the study of unfoldings of germs of such\nconnections in the chapters 2 and 3. The main result there is theorem 2.5. It\nshows that a germ of a meromorphic connection on a bundle on (C, 0) \u00d7 (M, 0)\nwith a pole of Poincar\u00e9 rank 1 along {0} \u00d7 M has a universal unfolding if again\na certain generation condition is satisfied. It generalizes the case M = {pt}\nwhich was treated in [Mal, (4.1)].\nf.\nWith theorem 2.5 one can reduce theorem 4.5 to the case when M = M\nThis case was already known. It was formulated by Sabbah [Sab1, Theorem (4.3.6)] [Sab2, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me VII 3.6], and independently by Barannikov\n[Ba1][Ba2][Ba3]. A major part of the initial data is equivalent to Barannikov's\nnotion of a semi-infinite variation of Hodge structures. Theorem 4.5 in the case\nf is also implicit in the construction in singularity theory [SK][SM].\nM =M\nChapter 6 is devoted to a class of variations of Hodge structures to which\ntheorem 5.6 applies, the variations of Hodge structures on the primitive parts\nof the middle cohomologies of smooth hypersurfaces in Pn whose degrees divide n + 1 (theorem 6.1). The corresponding Frobenius manifolds turn up as\nsubmanifolds in two different classes of Frobenius manifolds.\n\n\fMEROMORPHIC CONNECTIONS AND FROBENIUS MANIFOLDS\n\n3\n\nOne class arises in singularity theory. The base space of a semiuniversal\nunfolding of an isolated hypersurface singularity can be equipped with the\nstructure of a Frobenius manifold [SK][SM][He1]. Suppose that the singularity\nis a homogeneous polynomial in C[x0 , ..., xn ] of a degree which divides n + 1.\nThe submanifold of the base space which parametrizes homogeneous deformations carries a variation of Hodge structures isomorphic to the one of the\nprojective hypersurfaces in Pn . Then a larger submanifold which parametrizes\ncertain semihomogeneous deformations is a Frobenius submanifold. It is the\none determined by the variation of Hodge filtrations and an opposite filtration.\nThis is discussed in chapter 7.\nThe other class of Frobenius manifolds arises from the Barannikov\u2013\nKontsevich construction [BK][Ba1][Ba2]. There for any Calabi\u2013Yau manifold\na formal germ of a space which extends the moduli space of complex structure deformations is constructed and is equipped with a semi-infinite variation\nof Hodge structures. Together with the choice of an opposite filtration this\ninduces the structure of a Frobenius super manifold on the extended moduli space. In the case of a Calabi\u2013Yau hypersurface in Pn it turns out [Ba1,\nTheorem 6.5] that the whole semi-infinite variation of Hodge structures is determined by the variation of Hodge structures on the moduli space of complex\nstructure deformations. The whole chapter 8 is a discussion and reformulation\nof this result of Barannikov.\nIn the case of a homogeneous polynomial of degree n + 1, the results in\nchapters 7 and 8 give for suitable opposite filtrations isomorphic Frobenius\nsubmanifolds in the two classes of Frobenius manifolds.\nWe thank Dennis Borisov for some discussions about these Frobenius manifolds and Claude Sabbah for remark 2.10.\n\nIndex of notations and definitions.

Unfoldings of meromorphic connections\nTheorem 2.5 below generalizes a result of Malgrange [Mal, (4.1)]. We start\nwith the same setting as in [Mal].\nDefinition 2.1. (a) Consider a germ (M, 0) of a complex manifold, a germ\nH \u2192 (C, 0) \u00d7 (M, 0) of a holomorphic vector bundle, and a flat connection \u2207\non the restriction of H to (C\u2217 , 0) \u00d7 (M, 0). Let z be the coordinate on (C, 0).\nThe connection \u2207 has a pole of Poincar\u00e9 rank r \u2208 Z\u22650 along {0} \u00d7 (M, 0) if\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\ndz\n1\n\u2207 : O(H) \u2192 r OC\u00d7M,0 * \u03a9M,0 + OC\u00d7M,0 *\n\u2297 O(H).\n(2.1)\nz\nz\nHere O(H) is the OC\u00d7M,0 -module of germs of holomorphic sections of H.

(i) The results in [Mal] are formulated also for poles of higher\nPoincar\u00e9 rank. We restrict to Poincar\u00e9 rank 1 because that is the case needed\nin the later chapters and because a proof of a generalization of theorem 2.5, if\npossible, would be much more technical.\n(ii) The notations (T E), (T EP (w)), etc. in the definitions 2.1 and 3.1 are\ncompatible with those in [He2]. Here 'T ' stands for Twistor, 'E' for Extension\n(in z-direction), 'P ' for Pairing, and w is an integer.\nIf ((M, 0), H, \u2207) is a (T E)-structure and \u03c6 : (M \u2032 , 0) \u2192 (M, 0) a holomorphic\nmap of germs of manifolds then one can pull back H and \u2207 with id \u00d7\u03c6 :\n(C, 0) \u00d7 (M \u2032 , 0) \u2192 (C, 0) \u00d7 (M, 0).

Therefore the map C is a Higgs field on K.\nProof. This follows from the flatness of \u2207 and the fact that \u2207 has a pole of\nPoincar\u00e9 rank 1.\nFor a general discussion of Higgs fields see e.g. [Sab2, p. 36]. A symmetric\nHiggs field on the tangent bundle is the same as a commutative and associative\nOM -bilinear multiplication.\n\u0003\nTheorem 2.5.

Suppose that there exists a vector \u03b6 \u2208 K0 in the fiber K0 of K\nat 0 such that\n(IC) (injectivity condition) the map\nC\u2022 \u03b6 : T0 M \u2192 K0 , X 7\u2192 CX \u03b6\n\n(2.7)\n\nis injective and\n(GC) (generation condition) \u03b6 and its images under iteration of the\nmaps U : K0 \u2192 K0 and CX : K0 \u2192 K0 , X \u2208 T0 M, generate K0 .\nThen a universal unfolding of ((M, 0), H, \u2207) exists. An unfolding ((M \u00d7\ne \u2207,\ne i) with data (K,\ne C,\ne U)\ne as in lemma 2.4 is a universal unfolding\nCl , 0), H,\nif and only if the map\ne\u2022 i(\u03b6) : T0 (M \u00d7 Cl ) \u2192 K\ne 0 , X 7\u2192 C\neX i(\u03b6)\nC\n(2.8)\nis an isomorphism.\n\nThe rest of this chapter is devoted to the proof of this theorem. In [Mal,\n(4.1)] the case M = {pt} is considered. In this case the generation condition\n(GC) is satisfied if and only if U : K0 \u2192 K0 has for each eigenvalue only one\nJordan block. For example, if U : K0 \u2192 K0 is semisimple, it must have simple\neigenvalues. But in chapter 5 we will use theorem 2.5 in the case U = 0.\nThe first part of the proof follows [Mal], using an extension of H to a bundle\non P1 \u00d7 (M, 0) and using the rigidity properties of logarithmic poles, which are\nformulated in lemma 2.6.\n\nLemma 2.6. (a) (e.g. [Sab2, III.1.20]) Let (L\u2032 \u2192 (C\u2217 , 0) \u00d7 (M, 0), \u2207) be the\ngerm of a holomorphic vector bundle with flat connection \u2207, and let (L(0) \u2192\n(C, 0) \u00d7 {0}, \u2207) be an extension of (L\u2032 , \u2207)|(C\u2217 ,0)\u00d7{0} with a logarithmic pole at\n\n\f6\n\nCLAUS HERTLING AND YURI MANIN\n\n0. Then an extension (L \u2192 (C, 0) \u00d7 (M, 0), \u2207) of (L\u2032 , \u2207) with a logarithmic\npole along {0} \u00d7 (M, 0) exists with (L, \u2207)|(C,0)\u00d7{0} = (L(0) , \u2207). It is unique\nup to canonical isomorphism and it is isomorphic to the pullback \u03c6\u2217 (L(0) , \u2207)\nwhere \u03c6 : (M, 0) \u2192 {0}.\n(b) (e.g. [He2, 5.1]) Let (L \u2192 (C, 0) \u00d7 (M, 0), \u2207) be (the germ of ) a holomorphic vector bundle with a flat connection \u2207 over (C\u2217 , 0) \u00d7 (M, 0) and a\nlogarithmic pole along {0} \u00d7 (M, 0). The bundle L|{0}\u00d7(M,0) is equipped with\na flat connection \u2207res , the residual connection, and a \u2207res -flat endomorphism\nV res , the residue endomorphism. They are defined by\n\u2207res\nX [a] := [\u2207X a] for X \u2208 TM,0 , a \u2208 O(L),\nV res [a] := [\u2207z\u2202z a] for a \u2208 O(L).\n\n(2.9)\n(2.10)\n\nLemma 2.7. Let (H \u2192 (C, 0) \u00d7 (M, 0), \u2207) be a germ of a holomorphic\nvector bundle with a flat connection \u2207 over (C\u2217 , 0) \u00d7 (M, 0). There exists\nan extension to a trivial bundle H (gl) \u2192 P1 \u00d7 (M, 0) with flat connection\n\u2207 over (C\u2217 \u2212 {1}) \u00d7 (M, 0), with logarithmic poles along {1} \u00d7 (M, 0) and\n{\u221e} \u00d7 (M, 0), and with trivial monodromy around {1} \u00d7 (M, 0).\nProof. We follow [Mal, ch. 3]. First, one extends H to a bundle H (C) \u2192\nC \u00d7 (M, 0) with flat connection \u2207 over C\u2217 \u00d7 (M, 0). Then one can choose an\n1\nextension of H (C) to a bundle H (P ) \u2192 P1 \u00d7 (M, 0) with a logarithmic pole\nalong {\u221e} \u00d7 (M, 0). This bundle is not necessarily trivial.\nOne chooses an OM,0 -basis \u03c31 , ...., \u03c3rk H of germs of flat sections of\n1\nO(H (P ) )(1,0) and defines for r = (r1 , ..., rrk H ) \u2208 Zrk H a bundle H (r) \u2192\n1\nP1 \u00d7 (M, 0) as follows: on (P1 \u2212 {1}) \u00d7 (M, 0) it coincides with H (P ) ; the\ngerm O(H (r) )(1,0) is generated by the sections (z \u2212 1)ri \u03c3i . The bundle H (r) has\na logarithmic pole along {1} \u00d7 (M, 0). For some r the restriction H (r) |P1 \u00d7{0} is\ntrivial [Mal, (3.2)]. Because being a trivial bundle on P1 is an open property,\nthe bundle H (gl) := H (r) for such an r is trivial.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.8. If one applies lemma 2.7 to a (T E)-structure (H \u2192\n(C, 0) \u00d7 (M, 0), \u2207), then the extension (H (gl) , \u2207) has two distinguished properties:\ne \u2192 (C, 0) \u00d7 (M \u00d7 Cl , 0), \u2207)\ne\n(i) Because of lemma 2.6 (a), any unfolding (H\ne has a unique extension (H\ne (gl) \u2192 P1 \u00d7 (M \u00d7 Cl , 0), \u2207)\ne with all the\nof (H, \u2207)\n1\nproperties in lemma 2.7 whose restriction to P \u00d7 (M \u00d7 {0}, 0) coincides with\n(H (gl) , \u2207).\n(ii) Denote by \u2207res the residual connection on H|{\u221e}\u00d7(M,0) . The space\nV (H (gl) ) := { global hol. sections v in H (gl)\nwith \u2207res (v|{\u221e}\u00d7(M,0) ) = 0}\n\n(2.11)\n\nis a vector space of dimension rk H. A basis of it is an O(P1 ,z)\u00d7(M,0) -basis of\nO(H (gl) )(z,0) for any z \u2208 P1 . Below we will work with the connection matrix\ne (gl) , \u2207)\ne as in (i) the sections\nwith respect to such a basis.

Let (H (gl) \u2192 P1 \u00d7 (M, 0), \u2207) be a trivial holomorphic vector\nbundle of rank n \u2265 1 with a flat connection over (C\u2217 \u2212 {1}) \u00d7 (M, 0), with\nlogarithmic poles along {1} \u00d7 (M, 0) and {\u221e} \u00d7 (M, 0) and with a pole of\nPoincar\u00e9 rank 1 along {0} \u00d7 (M, 0). Define K := H (gl) |{0}\u00d7(M,0) , C and U as\nin lemma 2.4. Suppose that the generation condition (GC) of theorem 2.5 is\nsatisfied for a vector \u03b6 \u2208 K0 .

Define K := H|{0}\u00d7(M,0) ,\nC and U as in lemma 2.4 and g as in lemma 3.4 (a). Let \u2207res and V res be\nthe residual connection and the residue endomorphism on H|{\u221e}\u00d7(M,0) as in\nlemma 2.6 (b).\nBecause H is a trivial bundle, there is a canonical projection \u03c8 : H \u2192 K,\nand the bundles K and H|{\u221e}\u00d7(M,0) are canonically isomorphic. Structure on\nH|{\u221e}\u00d7(M,0) can be shifted to K. Let \u2207r on K be the shift of \u2207res and let V\non K be the shift of V res + w2 id. Then (K \u2192 M, \u2207r , C, g, U, V) is a Frobenius\ntype structure and (4.7) holds.\nProof. Part of it follows from the lemmas 2.4, 2.6 (b) and 3.4. For the rest\nand for details see [He2, Theorem 5.7] or [Sab2, VI 2].\n\u0003\nFrobenius type structures and (trT LEP (w))-structures can be restricted to\nany submanifold of the manifold (M, 0) over which they are defined.\nDefinition 4.3. (Dubrovin) A Frobenius manifold (M, \u25e6, e, E, g) is a complex\nmanifold M of dimension \u2265 1 with a commutative and associative multiplication \u25e6 on the holomorphic tangent bundle T M , a unit field e \u2208 TM , an Euler\n\n\fMEROMORPHIC CONNECTIONS AND FROBENIUS MANIFOLDS\n\n17\n\nfield E \u2208 TM , and a symmetric nondegenerate OM,0 -bilinear pairing g on T M\nwith the following properties.

(Structure connections of a Frobenius manifold, e.g. [Du,\nLecture 3], [Man2, I 2.5.2], [Sab2, VII 1], [He2, Lemma 5.11]) Let\n((M, 0), \u25e6, e, E, g) be the germ of a Frobenius manifold with Higgs field C,\nLevi-Civita connection \u2207g and d \u2208 C as in definition 4.3.

These structures are called (first) structure connections of the Frobenius manifold.\nV := TM,0 \u2192 TM,0 , X 7\u2192 \u2207gX E \u2212\n\nOne can recover a Frobenius manifold from a structure connection and the\nunit field. More abstractly, one can construct from a (trT LEP (w))-structure\nand a global section with sufficiently nice properties a unique Frobenius manifold such that the (trT LEP (w))-structure and the global section are isomorphic to a structure connection and the unit field [Sab1][Sab2][Ba1][Ba2][Ba3]\n(cf. remark 4.6 (i)). Theorem 2.5 allows to start under certain assumptions\nwith a (trT LEP (w))-structure and a global section over a smaller base space,\nto unfold them universally and then get a Frobenius manifold. This is formulated in theorem 4.5 in terms of Frobenius type structures.\nTheorem 4.5. (Construction theorem for Frobenius manifolds) Let\n((M, 0), K, \u2207r , C, U, V, g) be a Frobenius type structure and \u03b6 \u2208 K0 a vector\nwith the following properties:\n(IC) (injectivity condition) the map C\u2022 \u03b6 : T0 M \u2192 K0 , X 7\u2192 CX \u03b6 is\ninjective.\n(GC) (generation condition) \u03b6 and its images under iteration of the\nmaps CX : K0 \u2192 K0 , X \u2208 T0 M, and U : K0 \u2192 K0 generate K0 .\n(EC) (eigenvector condition) V\u03b6 = d2 \u03b6 for some d \u2208 C.\nThen there exist up to canonical isomorphism unique data\nf\nf, 0), \u25e6, e, E, e\n((M , 0), \u25e6, e, E, e\ng, i, j) with the following properties.

Choose w \u2208 Z. Let ((M, 0), H, \u2207, P ) be the (trT LEP (w))-structure\nwhich corresponds to the Frobenius type structure on K \u2192 (M, 0) by theorem\n4.2. Its germ over (C, 0) \u00d7 (M, 0) is a (T EP (w))-structure with all the properties in theorem 2.5. Consider a universal unfolding of this germ with base\nf, 0) = (M \u00d7 Cl , 0). It extends uniquely to a (trT LEP (w))-structure\nspace (M\nf, 0), H,\ne \u2207,\ne P ) which unfolds ((M, 0), H, \u2207, P ).

(i) Theorem 4.5 is reduced with theorem 2.5 to the case when\nf and when the map C\u2022 \u03b6 : T0 M \u2192 K0 is an isomorphism. This case\nM =M\nwas formulated by Sabbah [Sab1, Theorem (4.3.6)] [Sab2, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me VII.3.6],\nand independently by Barannikov [Ba1][Ba2][Ba3]. He called a major part\nof the initial data semi-infinite variation of Hodge structures (cf. remark 3.3\nf is also implicit in the construction in\n(ii)). Theorem 4.5 in the case M = M\nsingularity theory [SK][SM].\n(ii) A Frobenius type structure with M = {0} is simply a vector space K\nwith a pairing g and two endomorphisms U and V which satisfy (4.5) and (4.6).\nThen the condition (IC) in theorem (4.5) is empty, (GC) must be satisfied by U\n\n\fMEROMORPHIC CONNECTIONS AND FROBENIUS MANIFOLDS\n\n19\n\nalone, and (GC) and (EC) together are still more restrictive. For example, this\nsituation is satisfied at a point of a Frobenius manifold where the multiplication\nwith the Euler field is semisimple with different eigenvalues. This case was first\nconsidered by Dubrovin [Du, Lecture 3].\n(iii) The case of a Frobenius type structure with U = 0 can be considered\nas opposite to the case in (ii). It will be discussed in chapter 5.\n(iv) One can define (trT LP (w))-structures and Frobenius type structures\nwithout operators U and V [He2, 5.2]. Omitting the corresponding parts in\ntheorem 4.2, one obtains a one-to-one correspondence between them. One\ncan define Frobenius manifolds without Euler field. The analogues of lemma\n4.4 and theorem 4.5 hold. This follows with the remarks 3.3. But now the\ngeneration condition (GC) requires dim M > 0.\n(v) All the structures in chapters 2 to 4 were convergent with respect to\nparameters (t1 , ..., tm ) \u2208 (Cm , 0) \u223c\n= (M, 0). One can formulate everything in\nstructures which are formal in these parameters.\n(vi) A. Kresch [Kr, Theorem 1] proved a strong reconstruction theorem (existence and uniqueness) for formal germs of Frobenius manifolds without Euler\nfield and with some additional properties typical for quantum cohomology. It\nstrengthens the first reconstruction theorem in [KM, Theorem 3.1], which establishes only uniqueness. It looks as if his result is the special case of the\nf, 0) being\nanalogue of theorem 4.5 without Euler field and with (M, 0) \u2282 (M\nthe small quantum cohomology space. The collection of N(\u03b2, d) in [Kr, Theof|M , the conditions on A1 and A give the\nrem 1] gives the Higgs field C on T M\ngeneration condition (GC)' and the property CX CY = CY CX for X, Y \u2208 TM of\nthe Higgs bundle. The other conditions on Frobenius type structures (without\nU and V) seem to be built-in.\n5. H 2 -generated variations of filtrations and Frobenius\nmanifolds\nIn this chapter the special case of the construction theorem 4.5 for Frobenius\nmanifolds is studied when the Frobenius type structure satisfies U = 0. A\nFrobenius type structure with U = 0 is equivalent to a variation of filtrations\nwith Griffiths transversality and additional structure (lemma 5.1). Typical\ncases are variations of polarized Hodge structures with a condition, which\nis called H 2 -generation condition, motivated by quantum cohomology. The\ndefinitions 5.3 and 5.4 present the relevant notions, theorem 4.5 reformulates\nthe construction theorem in the case U = 0.\nLemma 5.1. (a) The structures in (\u03b1) and (\u03b2) are equivalent.\n(\u03b1) A Frobenius type structure ((M, 0), K, \u2207r , C, U, V, g) together with an\ninteger w such that U = 0 and V is semisimple with eigenvalues in w2 + Z.\n(\u03b2) A tuple ((M, 0), K, \u2207, F \u2022, U\u2022 , w, S). Here K \u2192 (M, 0) is a germ of a\nholomorphic vector bundle; \u2207 is a flat connection on K; F \u2022 is a decreasing\nfiltration by germs of holomorphic subbundles F p \u2282 K, p \u2208 Z, which satisfies\nGriffiths transversality\n\u2207 : O(F p ) \u2192 \u03a91M,0 \u2297 O(F p\u22121 );\n\n(5.1)\n\n\f20\n\nCLAUS HERTLING AND YURI MANIN\n\nU\u2022 is an increasing filtration by flat subbundles Up \u2282 K such that\nM\nH = F p \u2295 Up\u22121 =\nF q \u2229 Uq ;\n\n(5.2)\n\nq\n\nw \u2208 Z, and S is a \u2207-flat, (\u22121)w -symmetric, nondegenerate pairing on K with\nS(F p , F w+1\u2212p ) = 0,\nS(Up , Uw\u22121\u2212p ) = 0.\n\n(5.3)\n(5.4)\n\n(b) One passes from (\u03b1) to (\u03b2) by defining\n\u2207 := \u2207r + C,\nM\nw\nF p :=\nker(V \u2212 (q \u2212 ) id : K \u2192 K),\n2\nq\u2265p\nM\nw\nUp :=\nker(V \u2212 (q \u2212 ) id : K \u2192 K),\n2\nq\u2264p\n\nS(a, b) := (\u22121)p g(a, b) for a \u2208 O(F p \u2229 Up ), b \u2208 O(K).\n\n(5.5)\n(5.6)\n(5.7)\n(5.8)\n\nProof. First we prove part (b). The connection \u2207r and the Higgs field C\nare maps O(K) \u2192 \u03a91M,0 \u2297 O(K). They can be extended canonically to maps\n\u03a91M,0 \u2297 O(K) \u2192 \u03a92M,0 \u2297 O(K). Then the flatness of \u2207r means (\u2207r )2 = 0,\nthe Higgs field C satisfies C 2 = 0, and the potentiality condition (4.2) means\n\u2207r (C) := \u2207r \u25e6 C + C \u25e6 \u2207r = 0. Therefore \u22072 = (\u2207r + C)2 = 0, the connection\n\u2207 is flat. The filtrations F \u2022 and U\u2022 obviously satisfy (5.2) and\nw\nF p \u2229 Up = ker(V \u2212 (p \u2212 ) id : K \u2192 K).\n(5.9)\n2\nThe connection \u2207r maps O(F p \u2229 Up ) to itself because V is \u2207r -flat. Because\nof U = 0 the condition (4.3) is [C, V] = C. Equivalent is that CX , X \u2208 TM,0 ,\nmaps O(F p \u2229 UP ) to O(F p\u22121 \u2229 Up\u22121 ). Therefore U\u2022 is \u2207-flat and F \u2022 satisfies\nGriffiths transversality.\nThe condition (4.6) says that for a \u2208 O(F p \u2229 Up ), b \u2208 O(F q \u2229 Uq )\nS(a, b) = (\u22121)p g(a, b) = 0 if p + q 6= w.\n\n(5.10)\n\nTherefore S is (\u22121)w -symmetric and satisfies (5.3) and (5.4). It is \u2207-flat\nbecause for X \u2208 TM,0 and \u2207r -flat sections a \u2208 O(F p \u2229 Up ), b \u2208 O(K)\n(\u2207X S)(a, b) = X S(a, b) \u2212 S(\u2207rX a + CX a, b) \u2212 S(a, \u2207rX b + CX b)\n= 0 \u2212 (\u22121)p+1 g(CX a, b) \u2212 (\u22121)p g(a, CX b) = 0.\n(5.11)\nThis shows part (b). One passes from (\u03b2) to (\u03b1) as follows. One defines the\nendomorphism V by (5.9), the pairing g by (5.8), and one decomposes \u2207 into\n\u2207r and C such that \u2207r maps O(F p \u2229 Up ) to itself and CX for X \u2208 TM,0 maps\nO(F p \u2229 Up ) to O(F p\u22121 \u2229 Up\u22121 ). One easily checks all conditions of a Frobenius\ntype structure.\n\u0003\nRemarks 5.2. (i) If one adds in lemma 5.1 (a) (\u03b2) real structure with suitable\nconditions then one obtains a germ of a variation of polarized Hodge structures\nof weight w.\n\n\fMEROMORPHIC CONNECTIONS AND FROBENIUS MANIFOLDS\n\n21\n\n(ii) A Frobenius type structure is equivalent to a (trT LEP (w))-structure\n(theorem 4.2), which is composed of a (T EP (w))-structure at (C, 0) \u00d7 (M, 0)\nand an (LEP (w))-structure at (P1 , \u221e) \u00d7 (M, 0). One can refine lemma 5.1\n(a). There is a correspondence between (T EP (w))-structures with U = 0 and\nmonodromy (\u22121)w id on the one hand and germs of variations of filtrations with\nGriffiths transversality and a pairing on the other hand [He2, Corollary 7.14].\nUnder this correspondence an (LEP (w))-structure corresponds to a trivial,\nflat variation of filtrations. Putting these together, a (trT LEP (w))-structure\ncorresponds to the structure in lemma 5.1 (a) (\u03b2).\nBut the variation of filtrations F \u2022 which corresponds to a (T EP (w))structure (H \u2192 (C, 0) \u00d7 (M, 0), \u2207) does not live on the bundle K =\nH|{0}\u00d7(M,0) . It lives on a flat bundle on (M, 0) whose fibers are all isomorphic to the space of global flat L\nmanyvalued sections in H|(C\u2217 ,0)\u00d7(M,0) . The\np\np+1\nbundle K is only isomorphic to\n. Only in the case of a second\np F /F\nfiltration U\u2022 and a splitting (5.2) one obtains an isomorphism between K and\nthe flat bundle on which F \u2022 lives.\nDefinition 5.3. (a) A germ of an H 2 -generated variation of filtrations of\nweight w is a tuple ((M, 0), K, \u2207, F \u2022, w) with the following properties. w is an\ninteger, K \u2192 (M, 0) is a germ of a holomorphic vector bundle with flat connection \u2207 and variation of filtrations F \u2022 which satisfies Griffiths transversality\n(5.1) and\n0 = F w \u2282 F w\u22121 \u2282 ... \u2282 K\nrk F w\u22121 = 1, rk F w\u22122 = 1 + dim M \u2265 2.\n\n(5.12)\n(5.13)\n\nGriffithsLtransversality and flatness of \u2207 give a Higgs field C on the graded\nbundle p F p /F p+1 with commuting endomorphisms\nCX = [\u2207X ] : O(F p /F p+1) \u2192 O(F p\u22121 /F p ) for X \u2208 TM,0 .\n\n(5.14)\n\nL\nH 2 -generation condition: the whole module p O(F p /F p+1 ) is generated by\nO(F w\u22121) and its images under iterations of the maps CX , X \u2208 TM,0 .\n(b) A pairing and an opposite filtration for an H 2 -generated variation of\nfiltrations ((M, 0), K, \u2207, F \u2022) of weight w are a pairing S and a filtration U\u2022 as\nin lemma 5.1 (a) (\u03b2).\nDefinition 5.4.

(i) Properties (I) and (5.15) hold for even-dimensional quantum cohomology of Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds of complex dimension w \u2212 2. This\nfollows from the vanishing of the canonical class and the standard explicit formulas for the Euler field in quantum cohomology. Generally, our terminology\ninvolving \"H 2 -generation\" is motivated by quantum cohomology, for which\nker \u2207g E = H 2 .

A refined version of it (cf. lemma 8.2) was\nused already in the proof of [Ba1, Theorem 6.5].

Barannikov\u2013Kontsevich construction\nThe Barannikov\u2013Kontsevich construction was initiated in [BK] and further\ndeveloped in [Ba1][Ba2]. It yields for any Calabi\u2013Yau manifold a family of\nformal germs of Frobenius submanifolds. A central part of it is the construction\nof a semi-infinite variation of Hodge structures (defined in [Ba2]). This contains\nthe variation of Hodge structures for complex structure deformations of the\ngiven Calabi\u2013Yau manifold. Therefore it is not surprising that in the case\nof a Calabi\u2013Yau hypersurface in Pn certain submanifolds in the Barannikov\u2013\nKontsevich construction coincide with germs of the Frobenius manifolds which\none obtains from theorem 6.1 with theorem 5.6. This will be made precise in\ntheorem 8.1. All the results in this chapter are reformulations of results of\nBarannikov [Ba1][Ba2].\nLet X be a compact Calabi\u2013Yau manifold of dimension n \u2212 1. Let us fix\na holomorphic volume form \u03a9. Barannikov [Ba1][Ba2] constructed a family of formal germs (M, 0) of Frobenius supermanifolds of dimension m :=\ndim H \u2217 (X, C).

For n \u2212 1 odd MBar (X, W\u2264\u2022 ) is a formal germ of a Frobenius super\u2217\nmanifold with odd part corresponding to HLef\n(X) and even part corresponding\nn\u22121\nto Hprim (X). For n\u22121 even everything is even. This follows from the discussion\nV\nn\u22121\u2212p\nat the beginning\nof this chapter and from the isomorphisms p TX \u223c\n= \u03a9X\nV\nand H q (X, p TX ) \u223c\n= H n\u22121\u2212p,q (X), which one obtains by contraction of the\nholomorphic volume form \u03a9 on X with holomorphic vector fields.\nn\u22121\nThe condition n \u2265 4 asserts that H n\u22122,1(X) \u2282 Hprim\n(X). Therefore a\nminiversal family Xt , t \u2208 M0 , of complex structure deformations of X0 = X\nis given by a family of homogeneous polynomials ft , t \u2208 M0 , as in chapter 6\nwith condition (6.2) and f0 = f .\nBy construction of MBar (X, W\u2264\u2022 ) there is a natural inclusion (M0 , 0) \u2282\nMBar (X, W\u2264\u2022 ) of formal germs (the formal germ (M0 , 0) is called M cx in [Ba2]).\nBy lemma 4.4 and lemma 5.1 one obtains on T MBar (X, W\u2264\u2022 )|(M0 ,0) a formal\ngerm of a variation of filtrations with pairing and opposite filtration.\nThe following fact is crucial: This structure is isomorphic to the restriction\nto\ngerm (M0 , 0) of the variation of filtrations F \u2265\u2022 (Xt ) on the bundle\nS the formal\n\u2217\nt\u2208M0 H (Xt , C) and the opposite filtration W\u2264\u2022 .\nThis fact is at the heart of Barannikov's construction of semi-infinite variations of Hodge structures [Ba2, Theorem 4.2] and Frobenius manifolds.\nNow the case n \u2212 1 odd isSeasy. The variation of filtrations F \u2265\u2022 (Xt ) and the\nn\u22121\nopposite filtration W\u2264\u2022 on t\u2208M0 Hprim\n(Xt ) correspond to the formal germ of\nthe even Frobenius submanifold. By theorem 5.6 this germ must coincide with\nthe germ (M \u2032 , 0) of the Frobenius manifold before theorem 8.1 for filtrations\ne\u2022 and W\u2264\u2022 with (8.9). Because of the degrees of the flat coordinates the\nU\nextension with the odd part to a Frobenius supermanifold is rigid and is given\nby (8.10) and (8.11).\n2\nThe case n \u2212 1 even is more difficult because\nS the H\u2217 -generation condition\ndoes not hold for the variation of filtrations on t\u2208M0 H (Xt , C). But a slightly\nweaker condition holds so that lemma\n8.2 below applies. It shows that the\nS\nvariation of filtrations F \u2265\u2022 (Xt ) on t\u2208M0 H \u2217 (Xt , C) and any opposite filtration\nW\u2264\u2022 determine a unique holomorphic germ of a Frobenius manifold, whether\nW\u2264\u2022 respects the splitting (8.7) or not. It remains to see that precisely the\n\n\f32\n\nCLAUS HERTLING AND YURI MANIN\n\nfiltrations W\u2264\u2022 which respect the splitting (8.7) lead to the Frobenius manifolds\ne\u2022 ).\nMV HS (X, U\nOne can go into the proof of lemma 8.2 and start there with vector fields\n\u03b41 , ..., \u03b4m and an index set I \u2282 {1, ..., m} such that the isomorphism T0 M \u2192\nn\u22121\n\u2217\nH \u2217 (X, C) maps \u03b4i into HLef\n(X) for i \u2208 I and into Hprim\n(X) for i \u2208\n/ I.

Then\nthe flat submanifold {t \u2208 M | ti = 0 for i \u2208 I} is a Frobenius submanifold,\ne\u2022 ).\nand the whole Frobenius manifold is MV HS (U\n\u0003\nOne can generalize theorem 5.6 by relaxing the H 2 -generation condition\nslightly. The next lemma formulates the part of this generalization which is\nneeded in the proof of theorem 8.1. It was already used in the proof of [Ba1,\nTheorem 6.5].\nLemma 8.2.
