So far, the statistical model has been applied successfully in description of particle\nyield ratios and pT spectra measured in heavy-ion collisions [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] (there are also\ncomputation packages for thermal studies available from the Web [16, 17]). Now, the freeze-out parameters obtained\nfrom those analyses will be used to evaluate global observables: the transverse energy density dET /d\u03b7, the charged\nparticle multiplicity density dNch /d\u03b7 and their ratio. The advantage of such an approach is based on the fact that\ntransverse energy measurements are independent of hadron spectroscopy (in particular, no particle identification is\nnecessary), therefore they could be used as an additional test of the self-consistency of a statistical model. The same\nholds true for the charged particle multiplicity, which actually is the charged hadron multiplicity, according to the\nexperimental definition given in [18].\nThe experimentally measured transverse energy is defined as\n\nET =\n\nL\nX\ni=1\n\n\u00cai * sin \u03b8i ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8i is the polar angle, \u00cai denotes Ei \u2212 mN (mN means the nucleon mass) for baryons and the total energy Ei\nfor all other particles, and the sum is taken over all L emitted particles [19]. Additionally, in the case of RHIC at\n\u221a\nsN N = 200 GeV, Ei + mN is taken instead of Ei for antibaryons [20].\nThe statistical model with single freeze-out is used (for details see [13] and references therein). The model reproduces\nvery well ratios and pT spectra of particles measured at RHIC [9, 10, 11]. The main assumption of the model is the\nsimultaneous occurrence of chemical and thermal freeze-outs, which is important if pT spectra are considered (this\nenables to neglect the possible elastic interactions after the chemical freeze-out). Since in the present paper the\nintegrated quantities over pT are dealt with, the above-mentioned assumption should not be so important for final\nresults.\nThe actually detected (stable) particles have two sources: (a) a thermal gas and (b) secondaries produced by decays\nand sequential decays of primordial resonances. All stable hadrons and confirmed resonances up to a mass of 2 GeV\nfrom the Particle Data Tables [21] are constituents of the gas. The distributions of particles from source (a) are given\nby a Bose-Einstein or a Fermi-Dirac distribution at the freeze-out. The distributions of secondaries (source (b)) can\nbe obtained from the elementary kinematics of a many-body decay or from the superposition of two or more such\ndecays (for details see the Appendix and [13]). In the following, all possible (2-, 3- and 4-body) decays with branching\nratios not less than 1% are considered. Also almost all possible sequential decays are taken into account, namely:\n2 \u25e6 2, 2 \u25e6 2 \u25e6 2, 2 \u25e6 2 \u25e6 2 \u25e6 2, 2 \u25e6 3, 2 \u25e6 4, 3 \u25e6 2, 3 \u25e6 3, 2 \u25e6 2 \u25e6 3, 2 \u25e6 3 \u25e6 2, 3 \u25e6 2 \u25e6 2, 2 \u25e6 3 \u25e6 3, where 2, 3 and 4 mean the 2-, 3- and\n4-body decay respectively, and a cascade proceeds from the right to the left (as in the usual mathematical definition\nof the superposition of functions). It should be stressed that all contributions from weak decays are included. The\ncontribution to the transverse energy from the omitted cascades has been estimated at 0.2%. But since the most of\nthese cascades ends with two photons, they do not contribute to the charged particle multiplicity at all.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nTHE BASIS OF THE FREEZE-OUT MODEL\n\nThe following are the foundations of the model. A noninteracting gas of stable hadrons and resonances at chemical\nand thermal equilibrium is created at the Central Rapidity Region (CRR) of a collision. The gas cools and expands,\nand after reaching the freeze-out point it ceases. The conditions for the freeze-out are expressed by values of two\nindependent thermal parameters: the temperature T and the baryon number chemical potential \u03bcB . The strangeness\nchemical potential \u03bcS is determined from the requirement that the overall strangeness of the gas equals zero.\nA freeze-out hypersurface is defined by the condition\n\u03c4=\n\nq\nt2 \u2212 rx2 \u2212 ry2 \u2212 rz2 = const ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhich means that the freeze-out takes place at a fixed moment of the invariant time \u03c4 . Additionally, it is assumed\nthat the four-velocity of an element of the freeze-out hypersurface is proportional to its coordinate,\nx\u03bc\nt \u0010 rx ry rz \u0011\n1, , ,\n.\n=\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\nt t t\n\nu\u03bc =\n\n(3)\n\nThen the following parameterization of the hypersurface is chosen:\nt = \u03c4 cosh \u03b1k cosh \u03b1\u22a5 , rx = \u03c4 sinh \u03b1\u22a5 cos \u03c6,\n\nry = \u03c4 sinh \u03b1\u22a5 sin \u03c6,\n\nrz = \u03c4 sinh \u03b1k cosh \u03b1\u22a5 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b1k is the rapidity of the element, \u03b1k = tanh\u22121 (rz /t), and \u03b1\u22a5 determines the transverse radius\nr=\n\nq\nrx2 + ry2 = \u03c4 sinh \u03b1\u22a5 .\n\n(5)\n\nTo keep the transverse size finite, r is restricted by the condition r < \u03c1max . In this way one has two additional\nparameters of the model, \u03c4 and \u03c1max , connected with the geometry of the freeze-out hypersurface.\nAlso the transverse velocity, v\u03c1 , can be obtained\n\nv\u03c1 =\n\nr\u0010 \u0011\nr 2\nx\n\nt\n\n+\n\n\u0010 r \u00112\ny\n\nt\n\n=\n\n\u03c4 sinh \u03b1\u22a5\ntanh \u03b1\u22a5\n\u03b2\u22a5\n=\n=\n,\nt\ncosh \u03b1k\ncosh \u03b1k\n\n(6)\n\nwhich is the value of the transverse velocity \u03b2\u22a5 from the central slice after boosting it in the longitudinal direction.\nThe transverse velocity can be expressed as a function of the transverse radius\nr\n.\n\u03b2\u22a5 (r) = tanh \u03b1\u22a5 = \u221a\n2\n\u03c4 + r2\n\n(7)\n\nSince it is an increasing function of r, the maximum value of \u03b2\u22a5 called the maximum transverse-flow parameter (or\nthe surface velocity), is given by\n\u03c1max\n\u03c1max /\u03c4\nmax\n\u03b2\u22a5\n=p\n= p\n,\n\u03c4 2 + \u03c12max\n1 + (\u03c1max /\u03c4 )2\n\n(8)\n\nso it depends only on the ratio \u03c1max /\u03c4 .\nIII.\n\nTRANSVERSE ENERGY AND CHARGED PARTICLE DENSITIES\n\nAccording to the general description founded in [22] and developed in [10, 11] for the case with decays taken into\naccount, the invariant distribution of the measured particles of species i has the form\ndNi\n=\nd2 pT dy\n\nZ\n\np\u03bc d\u03c3\u03bc fi (p * u) ,\n\n(9)\n\n\f3\nwhere d\u03c3\u03bc is the normal vector on a freeze-out hypersurface, p * u = p\u03bc u\u03bc , u\u03bc is the four-velocity of a fluid element\nand fi is the final momentum distribution of the particle in question. The final distribution means here that fi is the\nsum of primordial and simple and sequential decay contributions to the particle distribution (for details see [13]). For\nthe hypersurface and expansion described in sect. II, eq. (9) takes the following form:\n\u03c1max\nZ /\u03c4\n\n+\u221e\nZ\nd\u03b1k\n\ndNi\n= \u03c43\nd2 pT dy\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nsinh \u03b1\u22a5 d(sinh \u03b1\u22a5 )\n\nZ2\u03c0\n0\n\n0\n\nd\u03be p * u fi (p * u) ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\np * u = mT cosh \u03b1k cosh \u03b1\u22a5 \u2212 pT cos \u03be sinh \u03b1\u22a5 .\n\n(11)\n\nNote that the distribution expressed by eqs.

The supplied values of\nthe thermal and geometric parameters are in this case T = 165 MeV, \u03bcB = 41 MeV, \u03c4 = 8.2 fm and \u03c1max = 6.9 fm\n[9, 13]. The geometric parameters were obtained from the fit to the pT spectra of the above-mentioned particles [24].\nThe integrated yields over pT are also given in [24], so the comparison with the predictions of eq. (12) can be done\neasily. The results are presented in TABLE I. Note that the very good agreement has been found.\nThe presentation of the main results of the paper needs a few comments concerning the AGS case. In the all cited\npapers the same method of establishing the thermal parameters T and \u03bcB is applied. The method is based on the\nbest fit of calculated particle density ratios to the relative particle abundance data. But the different model of the\nfreeze-out was applied for the description of pT spectra measured at AGS [2, 5]. In that model (for details see [25]),\nthe freeze-out happens instantaneously in the r direction, i.e. at a constant value of t (not at a constant value of\n\u03c4 as here). The shape of a hypersurface in the longitudinal direction is not determined explicitly, but due to the\nfactorization of the transverse mass spectrum it can affect only the normalization. The parameters connected with\nmax\nthe expansion are the surface velocity \u03b2\u22a5\nand \u03c1max . The transverse velocity profile has the following form\nmax\n\u03b2\u22a5 (r) = \u03b2\u22a5\n\n\u0012\n\nr\n\u03c1max\n\n\u0013\u03b1\n\n,\n\n(20)\n\nmax\nwith the choice \u03b1 = 1. Therefore, the implementation of values of \u03b2\u22a5\nobtained within that model into the presented\none is entirely ad hoc, nevertheless it works surprisingly well. Of course, one directly could apply the description of the\ntransverse flow from [25] to calculate the transverse energy and charged particle densities, but it is much more tempting\nand elegant to work within one model. Additionally, there is one technical problem connected with the treatment of\nresonance decays. Here, the very convenient form of the invariant distribution, eq. (9), has been derived because the\nnormal vector is proportional to the four-velocity, d\u03c3\u03bc \u221d u\u03bc . This is not the case for the hypersurface chosen in [25],\nso the calculation of resonance decay contributions would be much more complex (for the exact formulae, see [13]).\nNote also that in the view of [26], particle distributions depend very weakly on the exact form of the velocity profile\n(i.e. for considered \u03b1 = 0.5, 1, and 2) in the model described in [25]. It can be checked that profile (7) lies in between\ntwo profiles of the form (20) with \u03b1 = 0.5, and 1.\nmax\nTo put values of \u03b2\u22a5\nfrom [2, 5] into formulae of sect.

Generally, the overall agreement is good. For RHIC the 11% \u2212 16% underestimation of\nthe charged particle density has been received (5% \u2212 10% with respect to the lowest allowed values). But this result\nsimply reflects the existing inconsistency in measurements of the charged particle multiplicity at RHIC. Namely, the\nsum of integrated charged hadron yields (see TABLE I), after converting to dNch /d\u03b7 [20], is substantially less then the\n\u221a\ndirectly measured dNch /d\u03b7|mid . This is shown explicitly in the last column of TABLE II. For RHIC at sN N = 130\n\u221a\nGeV, the sum is 8.7% smaller then the total charged particle multiplicity. For RHIC at sN N = 200 GeV it is even\nworse, the sum is about 17% below the total dNch /d\u03b7|mid . But both values of the sum agree very well with the model\npredictions. Since the geometric parameters were established from the fits to the same pT spectra, the agreement had\nto be obtained. Also for AGS the results agree qualitatively well with the data, in spite of the roughness of the method\napplied for this case. The overall error of evaluations of transverse energy and charged particle densities is about 0.5%\nand has two origins: (a) omission of the most complex cascades; (b) simplifications in numerical procedures for more\ninvolved cascades. The velocity of the center of mass of two colliding nuclei, vc.m.s , equals: 0 for RHIC, 0.994 for SPS\nPb-Pb collisions at 158 * A GeV, 0.918 for AGS Au-Au collisions at 11 * A GeV and 0.678 for AGS Si-Pb collisions at\n14.6 * A GeV.\nValues of the ratio dET /d\u03b7|mid /dNch /d\u03b7|mid can be also given. They are collected in TABLE III, together with the\ncorresponding data. Generally, the overall overestimation of the order of 15% has been obtained. In the RHIC case this\nis the result of the underestimation of dNch /d\u03b7|mid , which has been explained earlier. But when in the denominator\nof the experimental ratio, dNch /d\u03b7|mid from the summing up of integrated hadron yields is put, the theoretical\npredictions agree very well with the data. Note that the similar inconsistency in charged particle measurements\ncould have also been the origin of the discrepancy between model and experimental values of dNch /d\u03b7|mid seen in the\nAGS Si-Pb case. For SPS, the result agrees with the experimental value within errors. The overall error of model\nevaluations of the ratio is less than 1%. These results have been also depicted together with the data in fig. 1. One\ncan see that the relative positions of theoretical points agree very well with the data, they are shifted up only and\nthis is the effect of the overestimation discussed earlier.\nmax\nIt should be stressed that dET /d\u03b7|mid /dNch /d\u03b7|mid depends substantially on the value of \u03b2\u22a5\n.

The\nexpansion produces additional energy so this process should increase the energy of a particle emitted from a thermal\nsource. The preliminary analysis of a static case was done in [1]. But to compare with the present results up-to-date\ncalculations should be performed. In [1] a gas with only 40 species (including antiparticles) was examined and feeding\ncharged particles from weak decays of neutral resonances was excluded. Thus, to extract the expansion contribution\nto dET /d\u03b7|mid /dNch /d\u03b7|mid one has to apply the general scheme of sect. III again, but with the proper replacement\nof the invariant particle distribution.\nFor a static gas (static in the c.m.s, of course), the invariant distribution of the measured particles of species i has\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 1: Values of the transverse energy per charged particle at midrapidity for the most central collisions.

(1).\n\nTABLE III, one can see that expansion is responsible for the following increases of the transverse energy per charged\nparticle: 11% for RHIC, 32% for SPS, 34% for AGS Au-Au collisions and 19% for AGS Si-Pb collisions. This can\nbe explained reasonably. The transverse energy per charged particle has two contributions: the first thermal and the\nsecond originated from expansion. The first is governed mainly by the temperature and the second by the maximum\nmax\nmax\ntransverse-flow parameter \u03b2\u22a5\n. For a given temperature, the increase of \u03b2\u22a5\nshould cause the weighting of the\nmax\nexpansion contribution. But for a constant value of \u03b2\u22a5\n, the strengthening of this contribution can be maintained by\nmax\nthe lowering of the temperature. This is why for almost the same \u03b2\u22a5\n(see the first column of TABLE II) the relative\ngrowth of the transverse energy per charged particle, after switching the expansion on, is much greater for AGS Au-Au\ncollisions than for RHIC ones. On the other hand, for comparable temperatures, the expansion contributes to the\ntransverse energy per charged particle much stronger for SPS than for RHIC (the former has substantially greater\nmax\n).\n\u03b2\u22a5\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe expanding thermal hadron gas model has been used to reproduce transverse energy and charged particle\nmultiplicity pseudorapidity densities and their ratio measured at AGS, SPS and RHIC. The importance of the present\nanalysis originates from the fact that the transverse energy and the charged particle multiplicity are independent\nobservables, so they can be used as new tools to verify the consistency of predictions of a statistical model for all\ncolliders simultaneously. The predictions have been made at the previous estimates of thermal and geometric freezeout parameters obtained from analyses of measured particle ratios and pT spectra at AGS [2, 5], SPS [14, 15] and\nRHIC [12, 13]. The overall good agreement, not only of the ratio but also absolute values of dET /d\u03b7 |mid and\ndNch /d\u03b7|mid , with the data has been achieved. And the observed discrepancies can be explained reasonably. This\nstrongly supports the idea that the thermal expanding source is responsible for the soft part of the particle production\nin heavy-ion collisions. Moreover, the description of various observables is consistent within one statistical model.\nIn fact, there are additional arguments which make the above statement even more valuable. In principle, one\ncould think at first glance that this analysis is nothing more like a kind of an internal consistency check of various\nmeasurements. And such a check could be done even in an model-independent way simply by integrating spectra of\nstable particles (the first time with the expression for transverse energy to obtain dET /d\u03b7 |mid and the second time\nwithout, to receive dNch /d\u03b7|mid ) and then adding them all. But there are two reasons that this can not be done\nwithout any external input. First, transverse momentum spectra are measured in limited ranges, so very important\nlow-pT regions are not covered by the data. For instance at RHIC, the first point for pions is at pT = 0.25 GeV/c, for\nkaons at pT = 0.45 GeV/c and for protons and antiprotons at pT = 0.65 GeV/c [24, 30]. There are also upper limits,\nbut contributions from ranges above them are suppressed strongly in comparison with the low-pT regions. Therefore,\n\n\f9\nto obtain integrated yields some extrapolations below and above the measured ranges are used. Usually two functions\nare used for each species and the contributed value is the average of their integrals. In fact these extrapolations are\nonly analytical fits without any physical reasoning, but, for instance, contributions from regions covered by them\n\u221a\naccount for 30% of the yield for pions, 40% for kaons and 25% for protons and antiprotons for RHIC at sN N = 130\nGeV [24]. On the other hand, a calorimeter acts very effectively for these species in the low-pT range, namely pions\nwith pT \u2264 0.35 GeV/c, kaons with pT \u2264 0.64 GeV/c and protons and antiprotons with pT \u2264 0.94 GeV/c deposit all\ntheir kinetic energy [19]. Since the very accurate predictions for the transverse energy density at midrapidity have\nbeen obtained (see TABLE II), the present analysis can be understood as an undirect proof that in these unmeasurable\npT regions spectra are also explicable by means of the thermal source with flow and decays.\nSecond, it is impossible to check the consistency of the transverse energy data because not all stable hadron spectra\nare measured at midrapidity for each collision case. This mainly concerns neutrons and KL0 . The lacking contribution\nfrom hadron decay photons could be approximated to some extent with the use of \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 spectra, but they are\nalso limited in ranges. And again, the very good agreement of model estimates of the transverse energy density at\nmidrapidity with the data can be interpreted as the strong argument that the production of neutral stable particles\ncan be described in terms of the expanding thermal source with superimposed decays.\nAnd last but not least, in opposite to the transverse energy, there is some inconsistency (of the order of 10%) of\nthe independent measurements of charged particle multiplicities with the corresponding sums of integrated charged\n\u221a\nparticle yields at RHIC (see sect. IV). However, only for the case of sN N = 200 GeV the substantial gap (of the\norder of 6% with respect to the direct measurement) between error bars of these two differently obtained values of\n\u221a\ndNch /d\u03b7|mid exists. For the case of sN N = 130 GeV the error bars overlap almost one half of each other. But since\n\u221a\nthe data at sN N = 200 GeV are still preliminary, it is difficult to judge whether this inconsistency has the physical\nor experimental (an additional systematic error?) reason.\nThe role of expansion is substantial. It produces about 10% \u2212 30% of the transverse energy per charged particle.\nBut, as can be seen from TABLE V, the expansion is not necessary to explain the experimental data for dET /d\u03b7 |mid\n/dNch /d\u03b7|mid . The results suggest that the most of the transverse energy per charged particle is produced by\nthe thermal movement. For sure, the expansion is necessary to explain the absolute values of dET /d\u03b7 |mid and\ndNch /d\u03b7|mid . To obtain these one needs a volume of a place of \"action\" and the most adequate way to do it is to\nparameterize the evolution of the system in space and time, that is to put the expansion in.\nAs the last comment, it should be stressed that the results of the present paper have been obtained within the model\nwhere the chemical freeze-out happens simultaneously with the thermal one. However, so far the most extensively\nstudied scenario is that where the thermal freeze-out occurs later then the chemical freeze-out (for a review, see\n[31] and references therein). This problem has not been addressed here. But one should notice that the distinction\nbetween these two freeze-outs means the introduction of the next parameter (the fifth here) into the model. Of course,\nan extra parameter in a phenomenological model always causes (or at least should cause) better agreement with the\ndata. At the present level of investigations both spectra (refs. [10, 11, 15]) and global observables dET /d\u03b7 |mid\nand dNch /d\u03b7|mid (this analysis) are predicted accurately with the assumption of the one freeze-out. However, more\ndetailed studies should be performed to check whether the transverse energy per charged particle measurement could\nhelp somehow in distinction or not between these two freeze-outs and this will be the subject of further investigations.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author gratefully acknowledges very stimulating discussions with Wojciech Broniowski and Wojciech\nFlorkowski.

For an n-body decay M \u2212\u2192 m1 + m2 + ... + mn , the momentum distribution of the product (labeled 1)\ncan be written (following the method presented in [9]) as:\n(n)\nf1 (|~\nq |, M, m1 , m2 , ..., mn )\n\n2sM + 1\n1\n= B\n2s1 + 1 N (n) (M ; m1 , m2 , ..., mn )\n\nZ\n\nd3~kfM (|~k|)\n\n\f10\n\u00d7\n\nn\nY\nd3 p~i\nEi\ni=1\n\nZ\n\n!\n\n\u03b4(M \u2212\n\n\u00d7\u03b4 (3) (L\u0302~k ~p1 \u2212 ~q) ,\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nn\nX\n~pi )\nEi )\u03b4 (3) (\ni=1\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere\n\nL\u0302~k p~1 = ~p1 +\n\n\u03b3k =\n\n(\n\nEM\n, EM =\nM\n\np~1 * ~k\nE1\n(\u03b3k \u2212 1) 2 +\nk\nM\n\n)\n\n~k ,\n\n(A.2)\n\nq\nq\nM 2 + ~k 2 , Ei = m2i + ~p2i ,\n\n(A.3)\n\nand sM (s1 ) is the spin of the resonance (the product), B is the branching ratio, fM (|~k|) denotes the momentum\ndistribution of the decaying resonance and N (n) is the corresponding phase-space integral:\n\nN\n\n(n)\n\n(M ; m1 , m2 , ..., mn ) =\n\nn\nY\nd3 p~i\nEi\ni=1\n\nZ\n\n!\n\n\u03b4(M \u2212\n\nn\nX\n\nEi )\u03b4\n\ni=1\n\n(3)\n\nn\nX\n~pi ) .\n(\n\n(A.4)\n\ni=1\n\nThe invariant amplitude for the decay, M, is assumed to be a constant here, so |M|2 cancels during normalization.\nWith the use of the well-known technique of splitting up the phase-space integral into a convolution integral over\ntwo phase-space integrals (here, the first responsible for the 2-body decay and the second representing the (n\u22121)-body\ndecay) [32], the following recursive formulae for the n-body decay can be derived:\n2sM + 1\n2\u03c0\n1\n2s1 + 1 N (n) (M ; m1 , m2 , ..., mn ) qE1 (q)\nM\u2212m\nZ 1\n\u00d7\ndm mN (n\u22121) (m; m2 , ..., mn )\n\n(n)\n\nf1 (|~\nq |, M, m1 , m2 , ..., mn ) = B\n\nm2 +...+mn\nk+ (q;M,m\nZ 1 ,m)\n\ndk k fM (k) ,\n\n\u00d7\n\n(A.5)\n\nk\u2212 (q;M,m1 ,m)\n\nN\n\n(n)\n\n4\u03c0\n(M ; m1 , m2 , ..., mn ) =\nM\n\nM\u2212m\nZ 1\n\ndm m N (n\u22121) (m; m2 , ..., mn ) p(M ; m1 , m) ,\n\n(A.6)\n\nm2 +...+mn\n\nwhere\n\nk\u00b1 (q; M, m1 , m2 ) =\n\nM\n|p(M ; m1 , m2 )E1 (q) \u00b1 qE(M ; m1 , m2 )| ,\nm21\n\n(A.7)\n\nfor m1 6= 0, whereas\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 k+ (q; M, m1 , m2 ) = +\u221e,\nfor m1 = 0, and\n\n\uf8f3 k (q; M, m , m ) =\n\u2212\n1\n2\nM (2)\nN (M ; m1 , m2 ) =\np(M ; m1 , m2 ) =\n4\u03c0\n\n| 14 (M 2 \u2212m22 )2 \u2212M 2 q2 |\n(M 2 \u2212m22 )q\n\np\n[M 2 \u2212 (m1 + m2 )2 ][M 2 \u2212 (m1 \u2212 m2 )2 ]\n,\n2M\n\n(A.8)\n\n(A.9)\n\n\f11\n\nE(M ; m1 , m2 ) =\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n\nM 2 \u2212 m22 + m21\n.\n2M\n\n(A.10)\n\nD.
