A result of Watanabe and Yoshida says that an unmixed local ring\nof positive characteristic is regular if and only if its Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity is\none. We show that, for fixed p and d, there exist a number \u01eb(d, p) > 0 such that\nany nonregular unmixed ring R its Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity is at least 1 + \u01eb(d, p).\nWe also show that local rings with sufficiently small Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity are\nCohen-Macaulay and F -rational.\n\n1. Introduction\nBy a result of Watanabe and Yoshida [7], an unmixed local ring R of characteristic\np > 0 is regular if and only if the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity,\ne\n\n\u03bb(R/m[p ] )\n,\ne\u2192\u221e\npde\n\neHK (R) = lim\n\nis equal to one. A short proof of this was given by Huneke and Yao in [6]. The HilbertKunz multiplicity has proven to be difficult to compute and even basic questions, such\nas whether it is rational, defied a solution despite intense effort. The above result raises\nthe following, also very basic, question: What is the smallest possible Hilbert-Kunz\nmultiplicity of a non-regular unmixed ring, say of fixed dimension d and characteristic\np? That is, we ask to determine the number\n\u01ebHK (d, p) = inf{eHK (R) \u2212 1 : R non\u2013regular, unmixed, dim R = d, char R = p}.\nIn this paper we start a first investigation into this question by showing that, at least,\n\u01ebHK (d, p) is always strictly positive, i.e the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of a non-regular\nring of fixed dimension and characteristic, cannot be arbitrarily close to one. The\nbound we obtain is by no means optimal as the few cases, where \u01ebHK (d, p) is known,\nshow.\nIn the course of our investigation we obtain a result of a similar flavor. We show\nthat a small Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity, precisely eHK (R) \u2264 1 + 1/d!, implies CohenMacaulayness and F -rationality (see Proposition 2.5). This sheds some light into the\ndifficult task of determining the subtle manner in which the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity\nencodes information about the singularity of R.\nKey words and phrases.

Lower bounds on the Hilbert-Kunz Multiplicity\nWe fix the notation of a d\u2013dimensional local ring (R, m, k) with maximal ideal m\nand residue field k of characteristic p > 0. For every positive integer e, let q = pe . If I\nis an ideal of R, then I [q] = (iq : i \u2208 I).\nDefinition 2.1. Let I be an m-primary ideal in R. The Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity of\nI with respect to R is defined by limn\u2192\u221e\n\nd! \u03bb(R/I n )\n.\nnd\n\nThis limit exists and is denoted\n\nby e(I, R), or, simply, by e(I). The Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of I with respect to R is\ndefined by limn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u03bb(R/I [q] )\n.\nqd\n\nThis limit exists and is denoted by eHK (I, R), or, simply,\n\neHK (I). The number e(m, R) is called the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity of R and usually\ndenoted by e(R).\nFor a collection of basic results regarding these notions, we refer the reader to [5],\nor [7]. We list here only a few well known facts that will be needed later.\nOne has \u03bb(R/m[q] ) \u2265 q d and the equality for one particular q implies that R is regular\nand hence \u03bb(R/m[q] ) = q d for all q. In general, max(1, e(I)/d!) \u2264 eHK (I) \u2264 e(I),\nfor every m-primary ideal of R. If I is generated by a system of parameters, then\ne(I) = eHK (I). In [4] Hanes recently showed that, in fact, e(I)/d! < eHK (I), for every\nm-primary ideal I, answering affirmatively a question raised by Watanabe and Yoshida\n(Question 2.9 in [7]).\nIn our paper, we look at the class of unmixed rings. We say that R is unmixed if all\nthe associated primes have the codimension equal to the dimension of R. We restrict\nourselves to this case, because there are examples of nonregular rings that are not\nunmixed with eHK = 1. We will also assume that d \u2265 2, since in the one dimensional\ncase the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity is at least 2 for nonregular rings.\nThe following lemma, although easy to prove, turns out to be a very useful tool in\nmany instances (see [6], Lemma 2.1, or [7], Lemma 4.2).\nLemma 2.2. Let (R, m, k) of characteristic p > 0.\n1) eHK (I) \u2264 \u03bb(R/I \u2217 ) * eHK (R).\n2) For I an m-primary ideal of R, denote fI = \u03bb(R/I)eHK (R) \u2212 eHK (I). Then, for\nevery pair of ideals J \u2282 I one has fI \u2264 fJ .\nThe following theorem was conjectured by Watanabe and Yoshida and is the key\ntool in our investigation.\nTheorem 2.3 (Goto-Nakamura, [3]). Let (R, m) be a homomorphic image of a CohenMacaulay local ring of characteristic p > 0.\n(1) Assume that R is equidimensional. Then e(I) \u2265 \u03bb(R/I \u2217 ) for every parameter\nideal I.\n\n\fON RINGS WITH SMALL HILBERT\u2013KUNZ MULTIPLICITY\n\n3\n\n(2) Assume that R is unmixed. If e(I) = \u03bb(R/I \u2217 ) for some parameter ideal I, then\nR is a Cohen-Macaulay F -rational local ring.\nRemark 2.4. An alternate proof of this theorem has also been given by Ciuperc\u01ce and\nEnescu, [2] (Theorem 1.1 and Remark 1.10), where (2) is obtained under some other\nmild conditions on R.\nFirst we present a result which shows that rings with sufficiently small Hilbert-Kunz\nmultiplicity are Cohen-Macaulay and F -rational.\nProposition 2.5. Let R be an unmixed ring that is a homomorphic image of a CohenMacaulay local ring of characteristic p > 0. If eHK (R) \u2264 1 + max{1/d!, 1/e(R)}, then\nR is Cohen-Macaulay and F -rational.\nProof. As the associated primes of R and R[x]m are in bijection, R is unmixed if and\nonly if R[x]m is unmixed. The same holds for the multiplicities, Cohen\u2013Macaulayness\nand F \u2013rationality. Thus we can assume that the residue field of R is infinite. Hence,\nwe can choose a minimal reduction ideal I for m (i.e. e(I) = e(m) = e(R)) such that I\nis generated by a system of parameters.\nLet us assume that R is not Cohen-Macaulay and F -rational. We show that this\nimplies that eHK (R) > 1+1/e(R). By Lemma 2.2 we have that e(I) \u2264 \u03bb(R/I \u2217 )eHK (R)\nand substituting \u03bb(R/I \u2217 ) \u2264 e(R) \u2212 1 (Theorem 2.3) we get e(I) \u2264 (e(I) \u2212 1)eHK (R).\nThus\neHK (R) \u2265 1 +\n\n1\n1\n> 1+\n.\ne(R) \u2212 1\ne(R)\n\nTo see that eHK (R) > 1 + 1/d!, it is now enough to consider the case d! \u2264 e(R) \u2212 1.\nThen we have\neHK (R) >\n\ne(R)\nd! + 1\n1\n\u2265\n=1+\nd!\nd!\nd!\n\nfinishing the argument.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 2.6. Watanabe and Yoshida ([7], [8]) have shown that, in dimension 2, under\nthe assumption of Cohen-Macaulayness, the minimal Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity is at\nleast 3/2. Our Proposition 2.5 shows that in fact this assumption can be dropped in\nthe case of unmixed rings that are a homomorphic image of a Cohen-Macaulay ring.\nNow we can address the existence of a lower bound for the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity\nof nonregular rings.\nTheorem 2.7. If (R, m, k) is an unmixed local ring that is the homomorphic image\nof a Cohen-Macaulay ring of characteristic p > 0 and dimension d. If R is not regular,\nthen eHK (R) > 1 + max{1/(pdd!), 1/(pd e(R))}.\n\n\f4\n\nM. BLICKLE AND F. ENESCU\n\nProof. As before we can assume that the residue field is infinite and let I be a minimal\nreduction for m. Proposition 2.5 shows that it is enough to consider the case when R\nis Cohen-Macaulay and F -rational.\nBy Lemma 2.2 we have fm[p] \u2264 fI [p] . Substituting into this inequality the identities\neHK (I [p] ) = eHK (I)pd , e(I [p] ) = \u03bb(R/I [p] ) and e(I [p] ) = eHK (I [p] ) we get\n(1)\n\neHK (R) * (\u03bb(R/m[p] ) \u2212 pd ) \u2264 e(I [p] ) * (eHK \u2212 1) = pd e(R) * (eHK \u2212 1).\n\nIf R is not regular, then (\u03bb(R/m[p] ) \u2212 pd ) \u2265 1 and we obtain from (1), by solving for\neHK (R), that\n\n1\n1\n> 1+ d\n.\npd e(R) \u2212 1\np e(R)\nUsing the inequality e(R) < d!eHK (R) in the right side of (1) we obtain similarly that\neHK (R) \u2265 1 +\n\neHK (R) > 1 +\n\n1\npd d!\n\n.\n\u0003\n\nRemark 2.8. Note that this given bound by no means improves the trivial bound for\nrings R with e(R) > d! given by\neHK (R) > e(R)/d! \u2265 (d! + 1)/d! = 1 + 1/d!.\nIt is the more interesting case of comparatively small multiplicity e(R) in which our\nbound gives new results.\n3. Proposed Problems\nA shortcoming of the bound of Theorem 2.7 is its dependence upon the characteristic.\nIn fact we suspect that the number\n\u01ebHK (d) = inf{\u01ebHK (d, p) : p > 0}\nis strictly bigger than 0. In the one dimensional case this is trivial, \u01ebHK (1) = 1. Work\nof Watanabe and Yoshida [7], together with our Remark 2.6, shows that \u01ebHK (2) = 1/2.\nFurthermore, Watanabe and Yoshida give a classification of all two dimensional CohenMacaulay rings with Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity less than 2. Up to dimension 4, Hanes's\nresults, [4], also give lower bounds for \u01ebHK (d, p) that are independent of p (he can show\nthat \u01ebHK (3) \u2265 1/3, and that \u01ebHK (4, p) \u2265 0.16). In private communications, Watanabe\nmentioned that he and Yoshida can also prove that \u01ebHK (3) = 1/3 in dimension 3.\nIn dimensions 2 and 3, Buchweitz and Chen have obtained the minimal Hilbert-Kunz\nmultiplicity of homogeneous hypersurfaces of fixed degree (see [1]). It should be noted\nthat none of these techniques are known to produce bounds in the general case.\nAnother question that comes to mind is whether \u01ebHK (d, p) is attained. If this is the\ncase, what is the significance of such rings with minimal Hilbert\u2013Kunz multiplicity?\n\n\fON RINGS WITH SMALL HILBERT\u2013KUNZ MULTIPLICITY\n\n5\n\nAre they unique up to isomorphism? Again, the work of Watanabe and Yoshida gives\nan answer in dimension two only, and all remaining dimensions remain completely\nopen.\nIn view of Proposition 2.5 we can shift attention away from non-regular rings to\nother classes of singularities, and ask for the minimal Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of d\u2013\ndimensional ring with prescribed singularity. The intuition behind this is that bad\nsingularities should force a high Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity. Our Proposition 2.5 is a\nresult of this type.\nAcknowledgements\nThe second author would like to thank Craig Huneke, Kei-ichi Watanabe for useful\ndiscussions and Douglas Hanes for providing him with a preprint of his work and interesting correspondence.
