The calculation is performed\nusing a new method for dealing with real radiation suggested recently by us in [1]. For the first\ntime, the two jet event rate is computed directly, without any reference to the inclusive cross-section\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons. We also calculate the energy distribution of the leading jet in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 2 jets and\nfind significant modifications of the shape of this distribution at NNLO.\nPACS numbers:\n\nHigh-energy physics will begin to explore a new energy\nfrontier when the Large Hadron Collider at CERN turns\non in 2007. Our understanding of physics at very small\ndistances will dramatically improve. However, a detailed\ninvestigation of the new physics we discover will require a\ncareful study of Standard Model backgrounds, detector\nresponses, and other similar issues. Since many layers\nseparate interesting physics from raw experimental data,\na dedicated effort is required to fully utilize LHC results.\nThere have been significant advances towards this goal in\nthe past few years; we now have an increased understanding of parton distribution functions and jet algorithms,\nimproved Monte Carlo event generators, methods for automating next-to-leading order calculations with large\nnumber of external legs and, finally, new technology for\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) computations.\nNNLO calculations are certainly not required for all\nprocesses at the LHC or existing colliders; however, there\nare a few situations in which NNLO calculations are\nhighly desirable. These include processes for which the\none-loop corrections are abnormally large (e.g. the production of the SM Higgs boson at hadron colliders [2])\nor for measurements in which high experimental precision is either achieved (e.g. the \u03b1s determination from\nthe three-jet event rate in e+ e\u2212 annihilation [3] or the\nW mass measurement at the Tevatron) or expected (e.g.\nW and Z boson production at the LHC [4]). These calculations should also inform us how accurate NLO calculations really are, beyond the standard checks of stability with respect to renormalization and factorization\n\nscales variations. We should learn to estimate the significance of NNLO corrections without performing the calculations, given the required precision for an observable and\nthe kinematic regions in which it is measured. For this\npurpose, exclusive NNLO calculations are needed, since\nexperimental cuts on the final state can have a strong impact on the convergence of perturbative expansion. Unfortunately, not a single calculation of a fully differential\nQCD observable at NNLO has been performed, either for\nlepton or hadron colliders.\nIn this Letter we remedy this situation and present\nthe calculation of the two jet cross-section in e+ e\u2212 annihilation at NNLO in perturbative QCD. Although jets\nand their properties have been studied very extensively\nat lepton colliders [5], we believe that such calculation is\nimportant for the following reasons: 1) it is the first-ever\ncalculation of a fully differential observable at NNLO;\n2) although the total rate for two jet events in e+ e\u2212\nannihilation is known through NNLO from indirect calculations, our results for distributions in two jet events\nare new; 3) this calculation is possible because of a new\nmethod we recently suggested for handling real radiation\nin hard processes [1]; it is important to demonstrate its\nefficiency by applying it to a non-trivial example.\nThere is a strong correlation between the complexity\nof higher order calculations and the level of exclusiveness\ndesired. Traditionally, it was thought that calculations\nat higher orders are difficult because of multi-loop integrals. A significant effort therefore went into developing\nflexible, easily automated methods for performing higher\n\n\f2\nloop computations [6]. As a result, calculations up to\ntwo loops are no longer prohibitively difficult; for example, the two-loop virtual corrections for 1 \u2192 3 and all\npartonic 2 \u2192 2 processes at hadron colliders have been\ncomputed [7]. Surprisingly, the major obstacle in obtaining differential results at higher orders are tree-level processes with additional final-state partons. While it is very\neasy to write down the corresponding matrix element, it\nis not possible to integrate it numerically over the restricted (exclusive) phase-space without first extracting\nthe singular structure of the integrand in the soft and\ncollinear limits. Analytic integrations also become extremely difficult because of the arbitrariness of final-state\ncuts. This problem has been successfully solved at NLO\nusing both the slicing and dipole subtraction methods\n[8, 9]. Attempts have been made recently to generalize\nthe dipole formalism to NNLO [10]; so far, they have not\ncompletely succeeded. It is therefore productive to look\nfor an alternative method of dealing with multi-particle\nfinal states in the presence of arbitrary constraints on\ntheir phase space.\nWhat are the ideal features of such a method? Given\nthe complexity of higher order calculations, it should\nsatisfy the following requirements: 1) the singularities\nshould be extracted in an algorithmic fashion; 2) the\nmethod should be easy to automate; 3) it should be easily\ngeneralizable, at least in principle, to arbitrary numbers\nof partons in the final state; 4) the method should work\nefficiently in the presence of arbitrary constraints on the\nfinal state; 5) it should lead to a fast and accurate numerical evaluation of physical quantities.\nWe have proposed such a method recently in [1]. We\nnow briefly describe its salient features. Consider a perturbative tree-amplitude M with n particles in the final\nstate. Its contribution to the differential cross-section\ncan be written as\nZ\n(n)\nd\u03c3 = d\u0393n |M|2 J({pi }),\n(1)\nwhere d\u0393n denotes the n-particle phase-space and\nJ({pi }) imposes restrictions on the final state (e.g. the\njet algorithm) which define the experimentally observed\nprocess. Throughout this Letter we use dimensional regularization (with d = 4\u22122\u01eb dimensions) for both infrared\nand collinear divergences. If all particles are well separated (resolved), |M|2 is finite; however, when the integration in Eq.(1) is attempted, there are divergences associated with soft and collinear kinematic configurations.\nA direct numerical integration of Eq.(1) is therefore not\npossible.\nIn Ref. [1] we demonstrated that by mapping the invariant masses onto algorithmically chosen new integration variables, it is possible to extract the \u01eb poles explicitly. We then obtain an expansion in \u01eb,\n2(n\u22122)\n\nd\u03c3 (n) =\n\nX\n\nk=0\n\ndFk\n2(n\u22122)\u2212k\n\u01eb\n\n+ O(\u01eb),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the coefficients dFk are well-defined, \u01eb-independent\nmulti-dimensional integrals for a generic function J . It\n\nneeds to be specified only at the stage of numerical evaluation. This allows us to derive results for arbitrary jet\nalgorithms and experimental observables.\nIt is relatively easy to derive such an expansion at\nNLO, where at most one parton can become unresolved.\nIn this case, trivial mappings [1] of the phase-space variables onto variables with range from 0 to 1 produce integrals with the following singular structure:\nI1 =\n\nZ1\n\ndxdy x\u01eb\u22121 y \u01eb\u22121 J(x, y).\n\n(3)\n\n0\n\nAll singularities in the above integral can be extracted\nby writing x\u01eb\u22121 = \u03b4(x)/\u01eb + [1/x]+ + \u01eb[ln(x)/x]+ + ..., for\nboth x and y in the integrand.\nBeyond NLO, two or more partons may become unresolved, which gives rise to a more complicated structure\nof overlapping singularities. Typically, we find integrals\nsimilar to\nI2 =\n\nZ1\n\ndxdy\n\nx\u01eb y \u01eb\nJ(x, y).\n(x + y)2\n\n(4)\n\n0\n\nThe procedure described above does not work because\nthe singularities are not factorized. To solve this problem, we apply the technique of sector decomposition [11];\nwe divide the integration region in Eq.(4) into patches\nwith a definite ordering of the integration variables (x <\ny and y < x) and reweight all variables in each patch so\nthat the integrations again range from 0 to 1. This leads\nto factorization of the singular limits. This procedure\ncan be completely automated. The same method should,\nin principle, work for any number of particles in the final\nstate, both massless and massive, and for any restrictions\non the final-state phase space.\nFor e+ e\u2212 \u2192 2 jets through NNLO, the largest multiplicity of particles in the final state is four (e.g. e+ e\u2212 \u2192\nq q\u0304gg). A parameterization of the 1 \u2192 4 particle phasespace in terms of five independent variables which is suitable for sector decomposition and extracting infrared divergences was given in [1]. In the same reference, we\ngave a more detailed description of the method, and considered a number of relatively simple examples. In this\nLetter we apply the method to a fully realistic and nontrivial problem \u2013 the calculation of the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 2 jets\ncross section at NNLO. Traditionally, the inclusive 2-jet\nrate is calculated at NNLO indirectly, by first computing the total inclusive cross-section for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons\nand then subtracting from it the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 4 jets and\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 3 jets cross-sections at LO and NLO, respectively. This paper presents the first direct calculation of\nthe 2-jet rate at NNLO. Using our method, we can also\nobtain differential results at NNLO, which can not be\nderived indirectly. We illustrate this by computing the\nenergy distribution of the leading jet in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 2 jets\nthrough NNLO.\nThe cross-section for e+ e\u2212 annihilation into hadrons\n\n\f3\nthrough order O(\u03b12s ) can be written as\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\u03b1 \u0011 \u0010\ns\n(2)\n(3)\nC1 \u03b4j,2 + C1 \u03b4j,3\n\u03c3 = \u03c30 \u03b4j,2 +\n\u03c0\n\u0011\u0013\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00112 \u0010\ns\n(4)\n(3)\n(2)\n, (5)\n+\nC2 \u03b4j,2 + C2 \u03b4j,3 + C2 \u03b4j,4\n\u03c0\nP\nwhere \u03c30 = 4\u03c0\u03b1QED q Q2q /s is the tree level cross\u221a\nsection for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304, s is the center of mass energy,\n\u03b1s = \u03b1s (s) is the MS QCD coupling constant and the co(j)\nefficients Ci describe jet cross-sections in various orders\nin perturbation theory, as indicated by the Kronecker\nsymbols. From inclusive calculations of the cross-section\n[12], we find\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nC1 + C1 = 1,\nC2 + C2 + C2 =\n(6)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n365\n11 2\u03b6(3)\nNf \u2248 1.99 \u2212 0.115Nf ,\n\u2212 11\u03b6(3) \u2212\n\u2212\n24\n12\n3\nwhere Nf is the number of massless fermion flavors.\nAn important goal of this Letter is the calculation of\n(2)\nthe coefficient C2 , the NNLO correction to the twojet production rate. For this, we need the two-loop virtual correction to e+ e\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304, the one-loop correction\nto the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304g process, and the tree level processes\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304gg and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304q1 q\u03041 . We also require the\ncoupling constant renormalization of the NLO result. At\norder O(\u03b12s ), all of these processes contain divergent contributions to the two jet cross-sections; the highest singularity is 1/\u01eb4 . The singularities cancel when individual\ncontributions are combined to form a physical observable.\nThe two-loop virtual corrections to e+ e\u2212 \u2192 q q\u0304 are\nwell-known [13]. We have outlined above how the treelevel four parton final state is handled in our approach.\nWe note that a global parameterization of the four particle phase space, which we used in [1] for the Nf terms,\nleads to large analytic expressions which are difficult to\nevaluate numerically. We found it much more convenient to select a different parameterization for the invariant masses in each individual term, thereby reducing\nthe number of sector decompositions required to extract\nthe singularities. This choice of parameterization can be\ndone automatically once the basis topologies appearing\nin the matrix element are identified. With this clever\nchoice of parameterization, the size of the computer code\nfor the fully differential NNLO e+ e\u2212 \u2192 2 jets process\nis not much larger than what we have found in simpler\nexamples in [1]. The required CPU time is also not very\nlarge; to achieve the precision on the jet rates presented\nin this paper, about four hours are needed on a PC with\na 3 GHz Pentium 4 processor.\nWe now briefly comment on the calculation of the oneloop corrections to the q q\u0304g final state. It might seem that\na different technique is needed to handle this contribution, since a virtual loop integration is involved. However, this is not the case [1]. Once the virtual loop integrals are expressed through Feynman parameters, they\ncan be treated identically to phase-space integrals. We\n\nfound it convenient to express them through standard\nhypergeometric functions, and use the one-dimensional\nintegral representation for the hypergeometric functions,\ntogether with the three-parton phase space parameterization. Although this procedure is not necessary, it is\nuseful because it provides an economical input for sector\ndecomposition.\nSince our approach to the problem is numerical, including the cancellation of 1/\u01eb poles, we must consider\nissues of numerical accuracy. The simplest check is the\ncomparison of the direct and indirect evaluations of the\ntotal two-jet event rate. The indirect result is obtained\nby taking the difference between the O(\u03b1ss ) contribution\nto the inclusive cross-section, given in Eq. (6), and subtracting from it the four-jet cross-section at LO and the\nthree-jet cross-section at NLO. Both of these quantities\nare computed in our code. We use the JADE algorithm\n[14] to identify jets in the final state. However, the jet\ndefinition is an independent subroutine in our code that\ncan be trivially changed if desired. Choosing the jet separation parameter for the JADE algorithm ycut = 0.1,\nwe obtain\n(2),indirect\n\nC2\n\n= (\u221249.2 \u00b1 0.4) + (1.7974 \u00b1 0.0011) Nf , (7)\n\nwhere the errors denote our integration uncertainties for\nthe 3 and 4 jet cross sections. A direct computation of\nthe same quantity yields\n(2)\n\nC2\n\n=\n\n10\u22126\n10\u22124 10\u22123\n(\u22124 \u00b1 4) \u00d7 10\u22122\n+\n+\n+\n\u01eb4\n\u01eb3\n\u01eb2\n\u01eb\n\u22124\n(\u22120.3 \u00b1 4) \u00d7 10\nNf + (\u221249.8 \u00b1 0.4)\n+\n\u01eb\n+ (1.798 \u00b1 0.002) Nf .\n(8)\n\nWe have included the integration errors found during an\nactual run for the 1/\u01eb poles to demonstrate the level\nof cancellation; the magnitudes indicated for the higher\npoles are typical of results found using our code. Comparing Eq.(7) and Eq.(8), we conclude that our program\nprovides a precision on the finite part of the NNLO correction to the two-jet rate better than 1%. We also conclude that our numerical cancellation of 1/\u01eb poles works\nvery efficiently. These features do not change significantly when the jet separation parameter ycut is varied.\nOur approach permits us to also compute differential\ndistributions in addition to the total rate. As an example, we present below the energy distribution of the\nleading jet in two jet events at NNLO. At leading order,\nthis distribution is simple; since two massless quarks are\nproduced, each jet contains half of the total energy. The\ndistribution becomes more interesting at NLO, when it\nbecomes possible for one of the jets to have an invariant mass different from zero. At NNLO, configurations\nwhen the invariant masses of both jets are different from\nzero appear for the first time. We compute this distribution by a simple modification of the jet function; after an\nevent is identified as a two jet event, the energies of the\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 1: Bin-integrated energy distribution for ycut = 0.1. The\nfractions of events in each energy bin are shown. The dotted\nhistogram denotes the LO result, the dashed histogram the\nNLO result, and the solid histogram the NNLO result.\n\ntwo jets are computed and the jet with the largest energy\nis identified. This number is then stored in the appropriate bin of a histogram. The corresponding bin-integrated\nenergy distribution is shown in Fig. 1 for ycut = 0.1,\nNf = 5, and \u03b1s = 0.121. The distribution is significantly\ndistorted by NNLO QCD corrections; the corrections are\nlarge for this ycut , and many situations that look like\nthree and four jet events are identified as two jet events.\nSmaller ycut choices lead to large logarithms in the perturbative expansion that invalidate the fixed order result.\n\n[1] C.

We have demonstrated our approach using\nthe non-trivial example of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 2 jets. We have computed the NNLO corrections to the energy distribution of\nthe two jets in e+ e\u2212 annihilation, and have shown that\nthe shape of the distribution changes when the NNLO\ncorrections are included. Our method allows other phenomenologically interesting distributions in 2-jet events\nto be easily computed; these will be discussed elsewhere.\nSince our approach is fully numerical, we have presented\nconvincing evidence that reasonable precision and control\nof numerical stability can be achieved. The method we\ndeveloped for this calculation is quite flexible; it generalizes straightforwardly to an arbitrary number of partons\nin the final state, both massive and massless. Given unlimited computing resources, it provides a complete solution to the problem of real radiation at higher orders\nin perturbative QCD. In practice, significant effort and\nsome ingenuity will be required to apply it to more complicated processes of direct phenomenological relevance.\nWe look forward to this challenge.\nK.
