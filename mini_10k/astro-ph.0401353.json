INTRODUCTION\n\nIn 1995, the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) became the\nmost well-studied extragalactic area in all of observational astronomy. Extremely deep optical exposures\ntaken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) were eventually joined by additional imaging and spectroscopic\nobservations from many observatories covering all wavelengths (cf. Ferguson, Dickinson, & Williams (2000) and\nreferences therein). This combined dataset - which was\nultimately expanded to include a complementary field\nin the southern sky - painted an extraordinarily detailed picture of a \"blank\" region of sky which turned\nout to be teeming with galaxies, providing astronomers\nwith an exquisite window into the high-redshift universe. The result was a series of important advances in\nthe properties of distant galaxies and large-scale structure in the universe. Many of these key discoveries depended critically upon knowledge of galaxy redshifts,\n1 Based in part on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology, the University of California,\nand NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial\nsupport of the W. M. Keck Foundation.\n2\nW. M.

M.\nKeck Observatory (Cohen et al. 1996; Cowie et al. 1996;\nSteidel et al. 1996; Lowenthal et al. 1997; Phillips et al.\n1997; Moustakas et al. 1997; Cohen et al. 2000; Cohen\n2001; Dawson et al. 2001).\nNearly ten years later, attention has returned to the\nnorthern HDF field (HDF-N) via an ambitious plan to\nuse a new generation of ground- and space-based instruments for probing the distant universe in even greater\ndetail. The Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey\n(GOODS; Dickinson et al. (2001)) project involves a coordinated effort by three of NASA's Great Observatories\nto obtain ultra-deep images of two selected fields in the\noptical (via the HST Advanced Camera for Surveys),\ninfrared (with the Spitzer Space Telescope), and X-ray\n(using Chandra) wavelength regimes. These two fields\ninclude a northern target area coincident with (but significantly larger than) the HDF-N plus a similarly-sized\nsouthern field coincident with the Chandra Deep FieldSouth. Again, intensive ground-based followup observations in all wavelength regimes are underway to exploit\nthis high-resolution space-based imaging. High-quality\nspectra of the many galaxies in the GOODS fields will, as\nbefore, be essential to understand both large-scale structure and galaxy evolution within these regions.\nKeck remains the most powerful northern-hemisphere\nobservatory for completing deep surveys of faint galaxies. Its efficient new DEIMOS spectrograph (Faber et al.\n2003) on the Keck II telescope was designed specifically\nfor acquiring multislit spectroscopy of over 100 faint\ngalaxies at once, and with its 16\u2032 field of view is ide-\n\n\f2\n\nTeam Keck\n\nally suited to survey the 10\u2032 \u00d7 16\u2032 GOODS-North (hereafter GOODS-N) field. Presented with this unique opportunity to make an important contribution to the community, the WMKO Director and scientific staff elected\nto complete a deep DEIMOS survey of this region and\ncommitted to releasing the resulting data to the community as rapidly as possible. We report herein the\nresults of this \"Team Keck\" Treasury Redshift Survey\n(hereafter, TKRS) in the GOODS-N field. Our survey\nis complemented by the Hawaii-led Keck/DEIMOS survey in GOODS-N described in the accompanying report\n(Cowie et al. 2004), and also by a Gemini-North survey\ncompleted with GMOS (Dickinson et al. 2004).\nIn \u00a72 of this report we review the construction of the\nphotometric catalog of the GOODS-N field on which we\nbased our slitmask designs. Section 3 discusses the acquisition and reduction of the spectra and the determination of redshifts. Section 4 concerns the redshift catalog,\nincluding the effects of target characteristics on the sample's completeness, the comparison of our survey with\nothers in the same area, the accuracy of our redshifts\nand quality assessments, and the accuracy of photometric redshifts in this field. Section 5 presents the redshift\nand rest-frame color distribution for our targets, and \u00a76\nconcludes the paper.\n2. PHOTOMETRIC CATALOG\n\nTo ensure timely access to a catalog of astrometric positions and approximate magnitudes for completing the\nspectroscopy, we generated our own independent catalog\nof sources in the GOODS-N field. We acquired a series of\n300 s R-band exposures using DEIMOS in imaging mode\non Keck II during the night of 2002 Dec 30 (UT), and\ncomplemented these with additional images obtained on\n2003 Feb 02 (UT) to complete coverage of the full ACS\nimaging region. The exposures were offset and dithered\nto compensate for the gaps in the DEIMOS CCD mosaic.\nAll images were bias subtracted and gain corrected,\nthen flatfielded with sky flats generated from the set of\n14 images acquired in this field. We employed an automated procedure to detect cosmic rays on each image and\nignored the affected pixels in all subsequent processing.\nThe mean sky level on each image was measured via an iterative sigma clipping algorithm and subtracted to eliminate sky brightness variations from the data set. Next,\nwe used DEIMOS images of an astrometric field to derive a distortion correction map which we applied to the\nimages of the GOODS-N field. This allowed us to shift\nand co-add the science images, yielding a mosaic image\nthat covered the entire 10\u2032 \u00d7 16\u2032 first-epoch ACS imaging\nfield. For this survey, we only considered the portion of\nthis mosaic image coincident with the first epoch HST\nGOODS-N observations. We obtained a first-order plate\nsolution for this mosaic using several stars measured in\nthe USNO astrometric catalog (Monet et al. 2003).\nTo generate our target catalog we used the SExtractor package (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) to detect positive\nfluctuations at least 20 px in size with a threshold of 1.0\ntimes the RMS sky noise. Because of vignetting near\nthe edges of the DEIMOS imaging field of view, the final mosaic image contains a few regions with spurious\ndetections. These bogus objects are generally very faint,\nand most were excluded from the final catalogue because\nthey lie below the faint magnitude cutoff of the sample.\n\nAlthough the USNO catalog provided an effective firstorder astrometric solution for the GOODS-N mosaic image, the small number of sources available in this field\nlimited the accuracy of the solution. The resultant RMS\npositional uncertainty of approximately 0.\u2032\u2032 5 is a significant fraction of the 1\u2032\u2032 slit width for spectroscopy, and\nhence a more accurate solution was needed to produce\nacceptable slitmask designs. In order to improve the\nobject positions, we used a catalogue of objects in this\nregion kindly provided by the SDSS team (York et al.\n2000) which produced a list of 130 stars common to both\ncatalogs. This permitted us to refine the astrometric solution and obtain a final RMS residual of \u223c 0.\u2032\u2032 13, more\nthan adequate for our needs. Comparing our derived\nastrometric coordinates to those obtained independently\nby Capak et al. (2003), we find no measureable offset in\n(\u03b1, \u03b4) and a dispersion of \u03c3 = 0.\u2032\u2032 40, indicating excellent\nagreement. Our coordinates agree less well in absolute\nzero point with those Giavalisco et al. (2004) obtained\nfrom HST imaging, against which the dispersion is 0.\u2032\u2032 23\nbut the offsets are \u2206\u03b1 = 0.\u2032\u2032 00 and \u2206\u03b4 = 0.\u2032\u2032 38; this suggests a slight error in absolute astrometric positions for\nthe ACS catalog. For several saturated stars which we\nwanted to use for rough slitmask alignment purposes, we\nderived estimated celestial coordinates positions visually\nby estimating the (\u03b1, \u03b4) coordinates for the location at\nthe convergence points of the diffraction spikes.\nThe unsaturated stars also served as photometric calibrators. The magnitudes we used were MAG BEST calculated by SExtractor, which are designed to estimate\nthe total light. Since only r\u2032 magnitudes were available\nfrom the SDSS database, we were unable to include any\ncolor terms in our photometric calibration. For the 130\nstars shared between the TKRS and SDSS catalogs, the\nRMS difference is \u2206R = 0.36 mag. The final magnitudes are in the AB system (Oke 1974), roughly equivalent to the SDSS r\u2032 . Figure 1 compares the SDSS r\u2032 and\nDEIMOS R instrumental response functions.\n\nFig. 1.- System (telescope, filter, and detector) response curves\nof R band filter used in the DEIMOS imaging (solid line) and the\nSDSS r \u2032 filter (dotted line). The r \u2032 filter is part of the system\ndevised to calibrate the SDSS survey (Smith et al. 2002), and is\nshown here to illustrate the differences in bandpass of the filters.\nNote that in the actual calibration of the TKRS catalogue, the\nr-band data from the SDSS DR1 release were used.\n\n\fTreasury Redshift Survey of the GOODS-North Field\n\nFig. 2.- Distribution of the difference in position angle measured from ground-based DEIMOS R-band images vs.\nHST WFPC2 I-band images in the HDF and Flanking Fields\n(Marleau & Simard 1998; Simard et al. 2002), binned in 10\u25e6 intervals. The solid histogram represents brighter galaxies with\nRAB \u2264 23.5, while the solid line represents the position angle differences for galaxies fainter than 23.5. Both bright and faint galaxies show a peak at position angle differences at 0\u25e6 , but whereas this\npeak is well defined for the brighter galaxies, for fainter ones the\nsmoother distribution indicates a poor correlation.\n\nSExtractor also provides for each object an estimate\nof its orientation as represented by the major axis position angle. This information can be used to orient spectroscopic slits to the major axis of the galaxy and thus\nobtain both improved S/N spectra and more accurate\nrotation curves. We compared the position angles derived from the DEIMOS mosaic image with independent\nmeasurements8 obtained from HST images by the UCSC\nDEEP1 team in the Hubble Deep Field and Flanking\nFields using two-dimensional two-parameter fits to the\nimages (Marleau & Simard 1998; Simard et al. 2002). A\nhistogram comparing the difference in position angles using 10\u25e6 bins is shown in Fig. 2. The solid histogram shows\nthe distribution measured for galaxies with R \u2264 23.5,\nwhile the dotted line represents the fainter galaxies. Both\ndistributions have been normalized by the total number\nof galaxies in each subsample. Although both distributions are peaked at values close to 0\u25e6 , indicating that\nthe two datasets generally agree, the peak is far more\npronounced for the brighter galaxy sample. We conclude\nthat the position angles measured by SExtractor are\nadequate for the brighter galaxies.\n3. SPECTROSCOPY\n3.1. Slitmask design\n\nThe selection of objects for spectroscopic observations\nfollowed roughly the same guidelines as used by the\nDEEP2 Redshift Survey (Davis et al. 2003), with one\nmajor difference: no attempt was made to use brightness,\ncolor, or other information to exclude stars and lowerredshift galaxies from the sample. All objects brighter\nthan the limiting magnitude were potential spectroscopic\n8\n\nData available at http://archive.deep.ucolick.org\n\n3\n\ntargets, regardless of whether their appearance was stellar or galactic. At the magnitude limit of this survey\nthe number of stars relative to the number of galaxies\nis small, so that the adopted strategy avoids excluding\nAGN-dominated galaxies.\nDEIMOS uses slitmasks to record over 100 broadband\nspectra at once. The limiting magnitude of the spectroscopic sample, the number of available nights and uniformity of wavelength coverage were all considered in designing slitmasks for our survey. The magnitude cutoff\nwas set at R \u2264 24.4 in order to provide sufficient source\ndensity per slitmask, yielding a sample of 2911 candidate targets for inclusion on masks. To improve consistency of wavelength coverage, objects were preferentially\nplaced near the center of the 4\u2032 available in the spatial\ndirection on each DEIMOS mask. Automated slitmask\ndesign software developed for the DEEP2 survey then\nselected appropriate targets from the catalog to produce\na set of 18 slitmasks, each displaced from the next by\n\u223c 0.\u2032 33, to cover the GOODS-N field. The resulting distribution in equatorial coordinates of the 2018 objects in\nthe spectroscopic sample is shown in Fig. 3.\nAll slits were tilted by a minimum amount with respect\nto the CCD rows in order to improve the wavelength\nsampling of the spectra; the slight offset between adjacent columns in the spectra serves to dither the night\nsky lines and thus permit a more accurate reconstruction of the background spectrum. For objects exhibiting\nsignificant elongation in the DEIMOS images, slits were\ntypically aligned with the major axis to improve both\nS/N and rotational velocity measurements. For closely\nspaced objects, slit position angles were chosen such that\nthe spectra of both objects were recorded. However, slits\nwere never tilted by more than \u00b130\u25e6 from the nominal\nposition angle of the slitmask.\n3.2. Observations\n\nSpectroscopic observations of the GOODS-N field were\ncompleted using DEIMOS on the Keck II telescope during early-to-mid 2003 as detailed in Table 1. Each observation used the 600 l mm\u22121 grating blazed at 7500 \u00c5,\nwith the GG455 order-blocking filter eliminating all flux\nbelow 4550 \u00c5. The central wavelength was set at 7200 \u00c5,\nproviding nominal spectral coverage of 4600\u20139800 \u00c5 at\na FWHM resolution of \u0393 \u2248 3.5 \u00c5. Eleven masks were\nobserved during time allocated to the WMKO Director,\nand the remaining seven were generously completed by\nthe DEEP2 Redshift Survey Team. Each slitmask was\nobserved for a total on-source integration time of 3600 s,\nbroken up into 3 \u00d7 1200 s integrations to allow rejection\nof cosmic rays. No dithering was performed between exposures because of the use of tilted slits and because the\nminor fringing pattern present in DEIMOS images is sufficiently corrected by the use of flat field images.\nTo enable wavelength calibration and the removal of\ninstrumental signatures, calibration data consisting of\nthree internal quartz flats and a single arc lamp spectrum (Kr, Ar, Ne, Xe) were obtained for each mask in\nthe daytime; the DEIMOS flexure compensation system\nensured that these calibration images matched the science frames to better than \u00b10.25 px. The transparency\nand seeing conditions on Mauna Kea varied from fair to\nexcellent during the observations, affecting the resultant\ndata quality.\n\n\f4\n\nTeam Keck\n\nFig. 3.- Projected sky distribution of objects in the DEIMOS spectroscopic survey sample. Shaded areas indicate the Hubble Deep\nField (dark grey) and the flanking fields (light grey). The outline indicates approximately the first-epoch HST ACS GOODS-N imaging\nsurvey region.\n\n3.3. Data reduction\nAll spectra were extracted using the fully-automated\npipeline developed by the DEEP2 Redshift Survey Team\n(Newman et al. 2004) and generously made available to\nus. Each spectral exposure was divided by its corresponding flatfield image to remove small amounts of CCD\nfringing. The three exposures for each mask were then\ncombined to yield an image cleaned of cosmic rays. For\neach slitlet, a 2-D sky-subtracted spectrum is obtained by\nmodeling the night-sky with a B-spline and subtracting\nit from the combined 2-D spectrum. Wavelength calibration was achieved by fitting to the arc lamp emission\nlines. The sky-subtracted spectrum of the target was\nproduced by summing over the rows containing the flux\nfrom the object as predicted by the tabulated position\nrelative to the slit endpoints.\n3.4. Redshift determination\nThe first phase of measuring redshifts involved fully\nautomated processing of each spectrum using the same\nalgorithm as the SDSS (Strauss et al. 2002), which calcu-\n\nlates for each lag position (i.e., redshift) the best representation of the source spectrum through the use of a set\nof template eigenspectra (Glazebrook, Offer & Deeley\n1998). These templates include several types of stars, a\ngalaxy absorption spectrum, a galaxy emission-line spectrum, and an AGN spectrum. The best fit is determined\nfrom the minimum \u03c72 in the redshift-lag and eigenspectra parameter space. The ten best fits are stored in the\n1-D image header.\nIn the second phase, all spectra were visually inspected\nby at least two team members, who would select both\na redshift and a corresponding quality code; objects for\nwhich no unambiguous redshift could be determined were\nalso noted. Due to low S/N spectra or to poor matches\nbetween the spectra of the templates and some program\nobjects, the automated redshift determination algorithm\nsometimes selected an incorrect redshift (Newman, private communication). However, all redshifts reported\nherein were agreed upon by two reviewers, and can thus\nbe considered secure. The adopted redshift quality codes\n(hereafter, Q; see Table 2) are the same as used by the\n\n\fTreasury Redshift Survey of the GOODS-North Field\n\n5\n\nTable 1.

We consider the\naccuracy of these quality codes in \u00a74.5.\nThe results from the visual inspections were then collated and discrepant cases noted and reassessed by one\nindividual. Here, \"discrepant\" means that one observer\nassigned a Q value of 3 or 4 (corresponding to a \"secure\"\nredshift) whereas another would select Q = 2 or less, or\nthat two observers would assign secure Q values but discrepant redshifts. The latter cases resulted when spectra\nof two different galaxies overlapped in the same slit.\nThe distribution of redshift quality codes among the\n2018 observed targets is shown in Table 2. The number of\nsecure redshift measurements (Q = \u22121, 3, 4) is 1536. The\nQ = \u22122 objects are technically not counted as failures;\nhence, the overall efficiency is 77% (1536/1987), which\nis comparable to the success rate of DEEP2 and similar\nredshift surveys (e.g., Cowie et al. (2004)).\n4. REDSHIFT CATALOG\n4.1. Data\n\nThe measurements resulting from our survey are presented in Table 6, a portion of which is reproduced here.\nThis table appears in its entirety in the electronic version of the Journal and also on the website devoted to\nthe survey9 . Photometric and spectroscopic data for all\ntargets detected in our imaging survey appear here, in\naddition to alternate redshifts from other surveys when\navailable. Redshifts for targets in our survey are only\ngiven when they are classified as secure (Q = \u22121, 3, 4).\nAlso available on the survey website is the master table of measurements which combines the results of this\nsurvey with those of the parallel effort by Cowie et al.\n(2004). Users of these data should note that the tabulated redshifts for our survey currently lack a heliocentric correction; an adjustment will be applied in future\n9\n\nhttp://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/science/tksurvey\n\nreleases, thus changing the zero point for the redshifts by\nno more than a few tens of km s\u22121 .\n4.2. Sample completeness\nIn the present section we examine the systematics\nof the present sample as a function of location in the\nDEIMOS field of view, apparent magnitude, color, and\nsurface brightness. The number of objects placed on\neach mask appears in Table 1, which also shows both\nthe number of targets for which secure redshifts were obtained (N (Q = \u22121, 3, 4)) and the success fraction per\nmask. On average, each mask contained about 112 objects, of which 76 (68%) produced secure redshifts. However, these numbers do not take into account the Q = \u22122\nobjects representing failures due to instrumental effects,\nso these numbers understate the survey's redshift measuring efficiency.\nSpatial effects. - Figures 4 and 5 depict the distribution\nof galaxies as a function of the DEIMOS mosaic x and\ny coordinates, respectively. The figures compare the distribution of all targets (dark grey histograms) to those\nwhich yielded secure redshifts (light grey histogram). In\nFig. 4, the periodic depressions result in part from a lack\nof slits placed in the inter-CCD gap regions (a product of\nthe slitmask design) and in part due to the decreased success rate for spectra taken acquired too close to the gaps\nand ruined. The decrease in number of objects at the\nedges of the DEIMOS mosaic y (shorter) axis is clearly\nseen in Fig. 5, and this is probably an effect caused by the\nslitmask design algorithm. For galaxies and stars located\nat the edges there is only one chance of being placed on\nmasks, in contrast to objects further from the edge.\nWe show the spatial distribution of objects for which\nredshifts were not successfully measured in Fig. 6. Objects which produced no measurable spectrum (Q = \u22122)\nbecause of instrumental effects are shown as circles.\n\n\f6\n\nTeam Keck\nTable 2.

As explained in the text,\nthe depressions at X = 2000, 4000 and 6000 correspond to the gaps\nbetween CCDs.\n\nSince these failures are primarily due to spectra falling\non the gaps between CCDs in the DEIMOS detector mosaic or to objects placed near the mask edges, they cluster in several lines across the GOODS-N field. Targets\nwhose redshifts are either completely unknown (Q = 1)\nor highly uncertain (Q = 2) are distributed randomly\nacross the field, as expected.\nMagnitude effects. - Our survey's sampling and success\nrates as a function of apparent magnitude are shown in\nFig. 7 and Table 3. For each 0.5 mag bin, the shaded histogram represents the differential quantity and the solid\nline (when present) indicates the integrated completeness\ndown to that magnitude.

Our slitmasks targeted 70\u201380% of the available objects over the range 20.5 < R < 24 that contains\nthe majority of the galaxies, falling significantly below\nthis level at the bright end (where sources were scarce)\nand in the faintest bin (containing faint targets against\nwhich selection was weighted during the slitmask design\nprocess). Panel (c) displays the fraction of these spectra\nwhich yielded secure redshifts (cf. Fig. 4 in Cowie et al.\n(2004)). Our success rate is high (> 90%) for galaxies\nbrighter than R = 23.0 and quickly decreases to below\n60% at the faint limit. Panel (d) gives the fraction of all\ntargets in the sample for which we obtained secure redshifts, and can be compared to the corresponding figures\nin Cohen et al. (2000) and Cowie et al. (2004). Overall,\nour survey obtained secure redshifts for 53% of all targets\nbrighter than R = 24.4 in the GOODS-N field.\n\n\fTreasury Redshift Survey of the GOODS-North Field\n\n7\n\nFig. 6.- Projected sky distribution of objects for which no successful redshifts were measured. Plotting symbols distinguish objects\nfor which no spectra were obtained because they fell on bad columns, gaps between CCDs, or at the edges of masks (Q = \u22122), objects for\nwhich a spectrum was obtained, but no redshift could be deduced (Q = 1), and objects which may yet produce redshifts or for which only\none spectral feature was identified on the spectra (Q = 2). Shaded regions indicate the HDF and flanking fields as in Fig. 3.\n\nColor effects. - The recent release of multicolor photometry for the GOODS-N field (Capak et al. 2004;\nGiavalisco et al. 2004) enables tests of color dependence\nin our sample. In the following analyses, we have\nmatched our target catalog derived from the DEIMOS\nphotometry with the Giavalisco et al. multicolor photometry derived from the v1.0 GOODS-N ACS images.\nObjects in both catalogs number 2816, with a detection\nrate of 2816/2911=90%. Most non-matching galaxies\nin the DEIMOS catalog are found in regions just outside that covered by the v1.0 GOODS-N catalog. Figure 8 displays the distribution of the V606 \u2212 i775 colors\nmeasured within a circular aperture of radius 3\u2032\u2032 for all\ngalaxies placed on mask, galaxies with secure redshifts\n(Q \u2265 3) and galaxies with unmeasurable or insecure redshifts (Q=1,2). The objects with failed redshift measurements are preferentially bluer than the successful targets.\nFigure 9 compares the colors of targets with successful\nand failed redshift measurements in different apparent\nmagnitude ranges, and shows that the distribution of\n\nfailed measurements changes from relatively flat to become bluer than the overall distribution near the faint\nlimit.\nThe apparent color-magnitude distribution of the sample in common with the GOODS-N V1.0 catalogue is\nshown in Fig. 10, where panel (a) shows the entire sample (stars and galaxies). Panel (b) shows the subsample of objects that were placed on slits, while panel (c)\ndiscriminates targets in various redshift quality classes.\nFailed reshifts (Q = 1) are predominantly found at the\nfaintest and bluest limits of the sample. A similar analysis made for the DEEP2 survey (Willmer et al. 2004),\nshows that most of these failed redshifts are likely to be\nof galaxies at high redshift, for which the [O II] lines fall\noutside the wavelength range of the DEIMOS setup used\nin the TKRS.\nThe sampling rate as a function of apparent V606 \u2212 i775\ncolor and magnitude is shown in Fig. 11. The sampling\nrate was measured in bins of 0.25 mag both in magnitude and color, and the shading in the figure represents\n\n\f8\n\nTeam Keck\nTable 3.

Panel (b) shows the success rate; i.e.,\nthe number of spectra that produced redshifts compared\nto the total placed on masks. The completeness level is\nhigher than 80% to about R . 23, beyond which it falls\ndue to the lower S/N of absorption line spectra, and the\nloss of key spectral features outside the wavelength range\nof the spectra.\nSurface brightness effects. - Figure 12 shows isophotal\narea plotted against z magnitude for all of the spectroscopic targets in our survey. Both photometric parameters are from the HST ACS imaging catalog of\nGiavalisco et al. (2004), with the magnitudes measured\nin the outermost aperture (3\u2032\u2032 ). In this plot we again\ndistinguish objects in the various redshift quality classes\nof our survey. The stellar and galaxy sequences are well\ndifferentiated to the limiting z magnitude. Objects with\nuncertain redshifts include faint stars as well as galaxies of varying brightness. Many of the brighter objects\nwith uncertain redshifts (Q = 2) failed because of poorly\ndefined extraction windows when creating the 1-D spectra. This problem will be revisited in a later re-analysis\nof the 2-D spectra and a corrected version of the catalog will be issued. Failed redshifts (Q = 1), as opposed\nto uncertain ones, start to occur at z \u2248 22. However,\nthe diagram provides no strong evidence that the Q = 1\ngalaxies have lower surface brightnesses than the subsample with secure redshifts.\n4.3. Comparison with other surveys\n\nAreas within the GOODS-N field have already been\nthe subject of intensive study by deep surveys of the\nHDF-N region that lies within it.\nAs mentioned\nin \u00a71, several research teams have obtained redshifts\nfor galaxies in this part of the sky, among them\nCohen et al. (1996); Cowie et al. (1996); Steidel et al.\n(1996); Lowenthal et al. (1997); Phillips et al. (1997);\nMoustakas et al. (1997); Cohen et al. (2000); Cohen\n(2001); Dawson et al. (2001). Recent work by other observing teams using Keck II with DEIMOS to survey\nthe GOODS-N field include the companion survey of\nCowie et al. (2004) and the higher-resolution survey of\nred galaxies by Treu et al. (2004). We can compare our\nmeasurements with the findings of these independent surveys to gauge the accuracy of our redshifts and our quality assessments.\nThe results of the redshift comparisons are depicted\ngraphically in Fig. 13 and key results are summarized in\nTable 4. For each survey, the table provides the number\nof objects in common with the TKRS sample in addition\nto robust measures of both the difference in measured\nredshift and the dispersion in that difference. For purposes of this discussion we defined two redshift measurements to \"agree\" if they differ by less than |\u2206z| \u2264 0.002\n(|\u2206v| . 600 km s\u22121 ); this excludes galaxies with severely\ndiscrepant redshifts and does not significantly bias the\nresulting measures of redshift offset and dispersion. To\nquantify the redshift differences with our work we computed the offsets via the biweight, while the median absolute deviation from the median (MAD, with multiplicative scaling factor 9) served as a robust estimator of the\ndispersion in the offsets (Beers et al. 1990). We now discuss the results of the comparison for individual surveys.\nIn an LRIS survey covering a region centered on the\nHDF and Flanking Fields, Cohen et al. obtained spectra for most galaxies with R \u2264 23.5 in the Flanking\nFields and R \u2264 24.5 in the HDF-N (Cohen et al. 1996,\n\n\fTreasury Redshift Survey of the GOODS-North Field\n\n9\n\nFig. 8.- Number of galaxies placed on masks (solid black line),\nand number of redshifts measured (grey histogram), as a function\nof the V606 \u2212 i775 color.

For 254 galaxies with redshift\nin rough agreement with ours (Fig. 13(a)) the biweight\ndifference is zCohen \u2212 zT KRS = 53 km s\u22121 with a dispersion of 174 km s\u22121 . Cohen et al. (2000) obtained secure\nredshifts for 52 targets measured poorly in the TKRS\nsample (Q = 1 or 2).\nAnother LRIS sample in the HDF-N and Flanking Fields is that observed by the DEEP1 survey team, who targeted primarily U - and B-band\ndropouts (Lowenthal et al. 1997) and compact galaxies\n\n(Phillips et al. 1997). Of 114 galaxies in common, 60\nhave redshifts within |\u2206z| < 0.002 of the TKRS measurement, and the distribution of redshift differences is shown\nin Fig. 13(b). The offset in redshift is zDEEP \u2212 zT KRS =\n27 km s\u22121 with a dispersion of 100 km s\u22121 . The DEEP1\nsample provides 7 reliable measurements of galaxy redshifts for which the TKRS redshift has a quality of 1 or\n2.\nThe Cowie et al.

Different symbols distinguish objects\nwith secure redshifts (Q = 3, 4), uncertain redshifts (Q = 2), no\nmeasured redshifts (Q = 1), and stars (Q = \u22121).\n\nregion as the TKRS sample, features 830 galaxies in common with TKRS, of which 452 have secure redshifts in\nboth works; see Fig. 13(c). Among the 378 redshifts in\nagreement, the offset is zCowie \u2212 zT KRS = \u221216 km s\u22121\nwith a dispersion of 141 km s\u22121 . A total of 56 galaxies\nfor which TKRS was unable to obtain a redshift (i.e.,\nQ = 1, 2) were successfully measured by Cowie et al.\nConversely, TKRS was able to measure redshifts for 50\ngalaxies that were observed by Cowie et al. but for which\nthey were unable to get a reliable redshift.\nFinally, in Fig. 13(d) we compare our redshifts with\nmeasurements obtained by Treu et al. (2004), who targeted preferentially red galaxies in the GOODS-N field\nusing Keck II with DEIMOS. Their higher-resolution survey used the 1200 l mm\u22121 grating to acquire exposures\nranging from 5\u201310 h, as compared to 1 h for TKRS. Of\n199 galaxies in common with our catalog, 178 have secure\nredshifts in the Treu et al. sample and 131 have secure\nredshifts in both samples; only one redshift measurement\nis significantly discrepant (|\u2206z| \u2265 0.0025). Among 130\nredshifts which agree the offset between these samples\nis \u221214 km s\u22121 with a dispersion of 42 km s\u22121 , so that\nthis sample represents the lowest dispersion with respect\nto our redshifts. These measurements from Treu et al.\nalso provide an estimate on how the increase of exposure\ntime affects the redshift success rate. Of the 18 objects\nin common whose redshifts in the TKRS were uncertain\n(Q = 2) or could not be measured, 7 (39%) agree with\nthe measurements with longer exposures. This number\ncorresponds to \u223c 4% (7/179) of galaxies within the sample in common. An additional 6% (11/179) of objects\nyielded successful redshift measurements with the longer\nintegration times.\n4.4. Accuracy of redshift measurements\n\nFig. 13.- Histogram showing the redshift differences between\ngalaxies with secure measurements in the TKRS vs. four other extensive samples in the GOODS-N region. Each panel shows the\nbi-weight location (dotted line) and its value (Beers et al. 1990).\n(a) Redshift differences for galaxies with secure measurements from\nLRIS in Cohen et al.

(c) Redshift\ndifferences with the Cowie et al. (2004) sample of galaxies, which\nused similar instrumental setup and integration times as the TKRS.\n(d) Redshift differences with the Treu et al. (2004) sample of galaxies observed with DEIMOS but using higher resolution and longer\nintegration times than this work.\n\nThe independent redshift measurements available for\na significant number of galaxies in our catalog allow us\nto estimate the uncertainty in our redshifts. Of the four\ncomparable catalogs described in \u00a74.3, the most useful\nones for comparison are the DEIMOS surveys of Treu et\nal. and Cowie et al., since they use the same instrument\nas our survey. Of these two, the Treu et al. sample is\nexpected to be more accurate by virtue of its higher dispersion (twice that of TKRS) and longer exposure time\n(typically 5 times longer). The dispersion in redshift\nmeasurements between these two surveys should thus be\ndominated by errors in the TKRS sample. As shown\nin the last column of Table 4, the robust estimate of\ndispersion in the redshift differences of these surveys is\n42 km s\u22121 . Assuming that the TKRS velocity uncertainties are at least a factor of two larger than those of Treu\net al. due to the difference in dispersion, we estimate an\naverage uncertainty of about 38 km s\u22121 for TKRS, with\nthe caveat that the sample of galaxies used in the comparison consists almost exclusively of early-type galaxies\nand is thus not representative of the GOODS-N region\n\n\f12\n\nTeam Keck\n\nas a whole.\nThe most comparable of the existing surveys to TKRS\nis the Cowie et al. sample made at the same dispersion\nand wavelength interval with DEIMOS. The dispersion\nin redshift measurements for the sample of 363 common\ntargets between these two surveys is 141 km s\u22121 . Assuming the two surveys have comparable uncertainties, this\nimplies an error of 99 km s\u22121 for each. This value is over\na factor of two higher than that measured compared to\nthe Treu et al. sample. This may be due to Cowie et al.\nsurveying fainter galaxies over a wider range of spectral\ntypes than Treu et al., as well as different slit orientations used by Cowie et al. vs. TKRS. Being conservative,\nwe conclude that the characteristic uncertainty in our\nredshift measurements is \u03c3 \u2248 100 km s\u22121 or better.\n4.5. Accuracy of Quality Codes\nThe existence of independent redshift measurements\nfor many objects in our catalog allows us to assess\nthe accuracy of our redshift quality categories. In\nother words, are the quality code 3 redshifts (which\nby definition should be correct at the 95% confidence\nlevel) truly correct 95% of the time? In Table 2\nwe match the TKRS catalogue with a list of redshifts measured by other authors. This list collated\nmeasurements from Cohen et al. (1996); Cowie et al.\n(1996); Lowenthal et al. (1997); Phillips et al. (1997);\nMoustakas et al. (1997); Cohen et al. (2000); Cohen\n(2001); Dawson et al. (2001); Steidel et al. (2003) and\nCowie et al. (2004). The collated catalog was then correlated against the DEIMOS catalog, providing a list of\nmatching objects. In assessing the number of correct\nredshift identifications, we assume that all discrepant\nredshifts result from errors in the present sample, thus\nobtaining a firm lower limit on the quality of our measurements. The final column in this table shows that\nthe Q = 4 redshifts agree with previous measurements\nin 94% of cases, establishing this as the lower limit to\nthe accuracy of our most secure redshifts. For Q = 3,\nthe corresponding lower limit on the success probability is 91.6%. If we make the more reasonable assumption that the mis-identifications are equally split between\nTKRS and other samples, the success rate increases to\n96% (Q = 3) and 97% (Q = 4). We conclude that the\nrespective intended confidence levels of 95% and 99% for\nthe category 3 and 4 redshift measurements are reasonably accurate.\n4.6. Comparison with photometric redshifts\n\nWe have compared the spectroscopic redshifts with\nthe photometric redshift catalog of Capak et al. (2004).\nThese redshift estimates are based on the ultradeep imaging in eight colors from the U to the near IR which is\ndescribed in Capak et al. (2003) and are computed using\nthe Bayesian code of Benitez (2000). This assigns odds\nthat the redshift lies close to the estimated value and we\nhave only used those cases where these odds lie above\n90%. The imaging data also saturate at bright magnitudes so we have restricted the comparison to sources\nwith R > 20. This gives a sample of 1078 sources with\nboth spectroscopic and photometric redshifts which we\ncompare in Fig. 14. Of the sources, 8 are broad line AGN\nwhere the photometric estimates may be poorer since the\ntemplates do not properly model such objects. We have\n\nFig. 14.- Photometric redshift versus spectroscopic redshift\nfor the 1078 sources with R < 24 where both have been measured\n(solid squares). Objects with broad-line AGN spectra are distinguished with a larger symbol. Only 38 of the photometric redshifts\ndiffer by more than 30% from the spectroscopic redshift. Five of\nthese cases are broad-line AGN.\n\ndistinguished these objects with larger symbols. Nearly\nall (97%) of the photometric redshifts agree to within\n30% with the spectroscopic redshift, consistent with the\nexpectation from the probabilities assigned to the photometric redshifts. This agreement is independent of magnitude over the 20 < R < 24 range.\n5. ANALYSIS\n5.1. Redshift distributions\nThe distribution of galaxies in our survey as a function\nof RAB and redshift appears in Fig. 15. Also shown\nin this plot and in Table 5 is the median redshift as a\nfunction of magnitude. The plot compares these values\nto the median redshifts in the Cohen et al. (2000) survey;\nboth samples are uncorrected for incompleteness. For\nbins brighter than R = 22.5, our median redshifts are\nsignificantly lower than those of Cohen et al.. We note\nthat the present survey has a cumulative completeness of\njust over 60% at R = 22.5, compared to > 90% for Cohen\net al.. In the faintest magnitude bin of the Cohen et\nal. HDF sample (23.5\u201324.0) the differential completeness\ndrops to the same 50% value as our survey, and as a result\nthe median redshifts in this magnitude range (zM = 0.79\nfor Cohen et al. vs. 0.80 in our sample) are consistent.\nFigure 16 shows the redshift distribution of galaxies\nwith secure measurements. This plot shows the number of galaxies contained within a velocity window of\nwidth \u00b1750 km s\u22121 at any given redshift and thus isolates concentrations of galaxies in redshift space. The\nwindow width of 1500 km s\u22121 is well-matched to the numerous structures with velocity dispersions of \u03c3 = 500\u2013\n700 km s\u22121 reported by Cohen et al. (2000) in the HDF.\nNumerous concentrations of galaxies are seen in the sample, most notably those at z = 0.51, 0.56, 0.64, 0.85, and\n1.02. These structures are equally prominent in the pie\ndiagrams shown in Fig. 17(a) and (b) which plot the projected linear offset from the field center (along the \u03b1 and\n\n\fTreasury Redshift Survey of the GOODS-North Field\n\n13\n\n0.3 in the Vega system). This effect has also been noted\nin the DEEP1 survey (Im et al. 2002; Weiner et al. 2004)\nin the Groth Survey Strip (which also used HST photometry), as well as in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(Strateva et al. 2001; Hogg et al. 2002) and COMBO-17\nsurvey (Bell et al. 2003). Figure 18(a) illustrates that\nthe the color bi-modality is clearly present to z > 1.1,\nwhich is beyond the limits both of Bell et al. (2003) and\nWeiner et al. (2004). The lack of low-luminosity red\ngalaxies, also noted by Weiner et al. (2004), is most likely\nto be a real effect.\n6.

The survey would not have\nbeen completed without the generosity of the DEEP2\nRedshift Survey Team, which not only developed the sophisticated data reduction pipeline for DEIMOS, but also\ndonated a significant amount of their DEIMOS observing time to complete the survey.
