The resulting quantum-potential is a\nN \u2212 1-body one. Inversely the Kelbg potential is reproduced which describes quantum systems at a\nquasi-classical level.

As a practical guide the quantum - Bruckner parameter\nrs has been replaced by the classical plasma parameter \u0393 as rs \u2248 0.3\u03933/2 .\n\nSeveral hints in recent literature conjecture that there\nseem to exist a correspondence between quantum systems\nand higher dimensional classical systems. The authors of\n[1] argue that a higher dimensional classical non-Abelian\ngauge theory leads to a lower dimensional quantum field\ntheory in the sense of chaotic quantisation. The correspondence has been achieved by equating the temperature characterising chaotization of the higher dimensional\nsystem with h\u0304 of the lower dimensional system by\nh\u0304 = aT.\n\nOn the opposite side there are systematic derivations\nof constructing effective classical potentials such that the\nmany body quantum system is described by the classical\nsystem. An example is the Kelbg potential for Coulomb\nsystems [5\u20138]\n\u0010 r \u0011\u0011\n\u221a r\n2 2\ne1 e2 \u0010\nKelbg\n1 \u2212 e\u2212r /l + \u03c0 erfc\n(2)\nV12\n(r) =\nr\nl\nl\n\nwith l2 = h\u03042 /2\u03bcT and 1/\u03bc = 1/m1 +1/m2 describing the\ntwo-particle quantum Slater sum correctly by a classical\nsystem. Improvements and systematic applications can\nbe found in [9\u201311].\nHere in this paper it should be shown that a classical\nN -particle system can be mapped exactly on a quantum\nN \u2212 1-particle system with respect to the partition function. Though the resulting effective N \u2212 1 body quantum\npotential is highly complex it can lead to practical applications for approximating strongly correlated classical\nsystems. In the thermodynamical limit it means that the\ndense classical system can be described alternatively by\na quantum system with properly chosen potential.\nThis finding suggests that the quantum calculation in\nlowest order perturbation might be suitable to derive\ngood approximations for the dense classical system. This\nis also motivated by an intuitive picture. Assume we\nhave a dense interacting classical plasma system. Then\nthe correlations will restrict the possible phase space for\ntravelling of one particle considerably like in dense Fermi\nsystems at low temperatures where the Pauli exclusion\nprinciple restrict the phase space for scattering. Therefore we might be able to describe a dense interacting\nclassical system by a perturbative quantum calculation\nwhen properly replacing h\u0304 by density and temperature\nexpressions. Indeed we will demonstrate in a one - component plasma system that even the time evolution and\ndynamics of a very strongly correlated classical system\ncan be properly approximated by quantum - Born calculations replacing the quantum parameters by proper\n\n(1)\n\nRecalling imaginary time evolution as a method to calculate correlated systems in equilibrium such correspondence seems suggestible. We will find a similar relation\nas a best fit of quantum - Born calculations to dense interacting classical systems.\nIn condensed matter physics it is a commonly used\ntrick to map a two - dimensional classical spin system\nonto a one - dimensional quantum system [2]. This suggests that there might exist a general relation between\nclassical and higher dimensional quantum systems. We\nwill show that a classical many body system can be\nequally described by a quantum system with one particle\nless in the system but with the price of complicated nonlocal potential. This can be considered analogously to the\nBohm interpretation of quantum mechanics [3] where the\nSchroedinger equation is rewritten in a Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation but with a nonlocal quantum potential.\nAnother hint towards a correspondence between classical and quantum systems was found recently in [4] where\nit was achieved to define a Lyapunov exponent in quantum mechanics by employing the marginal distribution\nwhich is a representation of Wigner function in a higher\ndimensional space. Since the Lyapunov exponent is essentially a concept borrowed from classical physics this\nfinding points also in the direction that there exists a\ncorrespondence between quantum systems and higher dimensional classical systems.\n1\n\n\fThis establishes already the complete proof that we can\nmap a classical N -body system on a N \u22121-body quantum\nsystem since (6) is the eigenvalue problem of a N \u2212 1body Schroedinger equation. To see this we can consider\na wavefunction \u03be built from the Fouriertransform of \u03a8\u0303\n\nclassical ones.\nLet us now start to derive the equivalence between classical and quantum systems by rewriting the classical Nparticle partition function. The configuration integral\nreads\nZ\nN\nY\n(1 + fij )\n(3)\nQN (\u03b2) = dx1 ...dxN\n\nN \u22121\n\n\u2212 h\u0304i\n\n\u03be(p1 ...pN \u22121 , t) = e\n\ni<j\n\nwhere\nwe\nused\nMeyer's graphs fij = exp (\u2212\u03b2uij (xi \u2212 xj )) \u2212 1 with the\ninteraction potential uij (xi \u2212 xj ) of the classical particles\nand the inverse temperature \u03b2. It is now of advantage to\nconsider the modified configuration integral\n\n(1 + f12 )(1 + f13 )(1 + f14 )...(1 + f1N )\n(1 + f21\u2032 )(1 + f23 )(1 + f24 )...(1 + f2N )\n......\n(1 + fN 1\u2032 )(1 + fN 2\u2032 )(1 + fN 3\u2032 )...(1 + fN N \u22121\u2032 )\n\n(8)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n= e\u03b2[u12 (x1 \u2212x1 )+...+u1N (x1 \u2212xN \u22121 )]\n\u00d7\u03a9\u03b4(x1 \u2212 x\u20322 )...\u03b4(xN \u22122 \u2212 x\u2032N \u22121 )\u03b4i\u20321 ,i1 ...\u03b4i\u2032N \u22121 ,iN \u22121 . (10)\n\n(4)\n\nThe resulting equivalent quantum potential (10) is a\nN \u2212 1-body nonlocal potential with respect to the coordinates but depends on N strength function parameter (e.g. charges). Therefore we have casted a classical\nN -body problem into a nonlocal quantum N \u2212 1 body\nproblem. One could easily give also a symmetrised or\nanti-symmetrised form of the potential using symmetries\nof the wave function and permuting coordinates of (10)\nrespectively. We do not need it here since we will restrict\nto applications neglecting exchange correlations further\non.\nWhile the above correspondence holds for any particle\nnumber and might be useful to find solvable models for\nclassical three - body problems, we will consider in the\nfollowing many - body systems. First let us invert the\nproblem and search for an effective classical potential approximating quantum systems. This should us lead to the\nknown Kelbg-potential (2). For this purpose we assume\na quantum system described in lowest approximation by\na Slater determinant or a complete factorisation of the\nmany - body wave function into single wave function\n\u03a8i1 ...iN (x1 ...xN ) = \u03c6i1 ...\u03c6iN . We neglect for simplicity\nexchange correlations in the following. The corresponding eigenvalue equation for \u03c6 itself one can obtain from\n(6) or (9) by multiplying with \u03a8\u2217i2 ..iN \u22121 (x2 ...xN \u22121 ) and\nintegrate over x2 ...xN \u22121 . To see the generic structure\nmore clearly we better calculate the correlation energy\nby multiplying (6) or (9) by \u03a8\u2217i2 ..iN \u22121 i1 (x2 ...xN ) and integrating over x2 ...xN . This provides also the eigenvalue\n\u01eb{i} and leads easily to approximations for the partition\nfunction (3). To demonstrate this we choose the lowest\norder approximation taking identical plane waves for \u03c6.\nThan the pressure can be obtained from the partition\nfunction QN via (7)\n\n(5)\n\nwith some \"quantum numbers\" {i} characterising the\nstate.

Also in\nprinciple the degenerate case could be calculated using\nFermi-Dirac distributions in (15). But one should then\nconsider also the neglected exchange correlations during\nfactorisation of \u03a8 as well. Let us summarise that the\nknown effective classical potential describing a quantum\nsystem in binary approximation has been recovered by\nidentifying the effective two-particle interaction within\nthe correlation energy.\nWe want now to proceed to a phenomenological level\nin that the above correspondence between quantum and\nclassical systems motivates to find good approximations\nfor the dynamics of classical many-body systems by employing quantum-Born approximations. This can be understood by the fact that the Kelbg potential deviates\nappreciably from the Coulomb one only if the interparticle distance d are smaller than the thermal wave length\n\u03bb. In other words for dense classical systems under such\nconditions we can think of it as a dilute quantum system\nreplacing \u03bb \u223c d. To check this conjecture let us consider\nan one-component plasma system which is characterised\nby two values.

Quantum effects will play a role if rs \u2264 1. We will consider the\nsituation that the interaction of such system is switched\non at initial time. Then the correlations are formed by\nthe system which is seen in an increase of temperature\naccompanied by the build up of negative correlation energy. This theoretical experiment has been investigated\nnumerically by [12] for classical plasmas with different\nplasma parameter \u0393.\nIn [13,14] we have calculated the formation of such\ncorrelations by using quantum kinetic equations in Born\napproximation.

The time evolution of a classical one-component\nplasma after sudden switching of interaction [12] compared\nto the quantum Born result when the Bruckner parameter is\nreplaced according to (19). The long time equilibrium value is\nremarkably well reproduced by the quantum - Born result(18).\n\n\u2212\n. The statical screened Coulomb in\u2212\nteraction is VD (q) = 4\u03c0e2 h\u03042 /(q 2 + h\u03042 \u03ba2 ) with the inverse\nscreening length expressed by density n and temperature\nT as \u03ba2 = 4\u03c0e2 n/T or \u03ba2 = 6\u03c0e2 n/\u01ebf for the high or\nlow temperature limit. For both cases dynamical as well\nas statical screening it was possible to integrate analytically the time dependent correlation energy (17). This\nhas allowed to describe the time dependence of simulations in the weak coupling limit \u0393 < 1 appropriately [13].\nFor stronger coupling \u0393 \u2265 1 the Born approximation fails\nsince the exact correlation energy of simulation\np is lower\nthan the first order (Born) result \u03bae2 /2T = 3/2\u03933/2 .\nMoreover there appear typical oscillations as seen in figure 2.\nNow we will employ the ideas developed above and will\nuse the quantum Born approximations in the strongly\ndegenerated case to describe the classical strongly correlated system.

This is exactly the distance where the Kelbg potential (13) or (2)\nstarts to deviate from the Coulomb potential. In other\nwords we confirm the conjecture that the dense classical\nsystem can be described by dilute quantum systems if in\nthe latter systems the thermal wave length is replaced by\nthe interparticle distance. This condition (19) can also\nbe rewritten into the result (1) of literature using the\ndegenerated screening length.\nWe summarise that in equilibrium we have shown that\nthere exist an exact relation between a N -body classical\nsystem and a N \u2212 1-body quantum system. This has\nallowed to recover the quantum Kelbg potential easily.\nAs practical consequence we suggest to describe the dynamics of dense interacting classical many body systems\nby the simpler perturbative quantum calculation in de4\n\n\fgenerate limit replacing properly h\u0304 by typical classical\nparameters of the system.\nI would like to thank S.
