Nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) has provided unique methods for demonstrating the realization of quantum\nlogical operations and characterizing the quantum state of spin systems. The great sucess\nachieved so far by NMR QC is related to its ability for controlling the dynamics of the spins\nthrough radio frequency (RF) pulses [6, 7]. This great control also enables the creation\nof pulse sequences for the determination of elements of the nuclear spins density matrix,\ncalled the Quantum State Tomography process (QST). The first NMR QST method was\ndeveloped by Chuang et al. [8] and optimized by Long et al. [9] for systems of heteronuclear\ncoupled spins 1/2. It consists basically in applying a set of specially designed rotations on\nthe different spins and reconstructing the density matrix from the resulting NMR spectra.\nThis method was later adapted for homonuclear coupled spins 1/2 [10, 11] and also for\nquadrupolar spin 3/2 systems [12\u201317], where nonselective pulses were replaced by transitionselective RF pulses. The disadvantage of such method is the long time required to perform\na selective pulse, producing considerable unwanted evolution of the system during the QST\nprocess. Besides, the mathematical formalism used to manipulate the transition operators\n[18\u201320] are quite complicated and the resulting equations are not easily generalizable for\nnuclei with nuclear spin greater than 3/2. Thus, a new method for tomography [21], based\non nonselective pulses [22], was proposed and generalized to any spin system.\nPrevious works, that used nonselective pulses to implement QST, explored a spin 3/2\nquadrupolar system (an effective two-qubits system) showing the great acurracy of the technique [12, 21] also for relaxation studies [23\u201326] and simulation of quantum systems [27] .\nHowever, when the spin quantum number is increased, some technical problems during the\nimplementation may appear. For example, during each pulse of the QST process, several\nexperimental errors, like oscillating field inhomogeneities, pulse imperfections, quadrupolar\nevolution, among others, may compromise the method performance.\nWe report the QST adaptation for spin I = 7/2 in Section II. Testing procedures, results\nthat confirm its efficiency and simulations that took experimental limitations into account\nare shown in Section III. In Section IV we show the experimental data obtained through\nthe use of Strong Modulating Pulses (SMP) [28] and QST for creating computational base\n\n2\n\n\fstates, logic gates and quantum algorithms.\n\nII.\n\nDENSITY MATRIX TOMOGRAPHY METHOD\n\nIn this section we will revise the QST method in details, with special emphasis on the\ngeneral features that makes the method suitable for use in systems with arbitrary spins.\n\nA.\n\nMagnetization and the deviation density matrix\n\nIn a NMR experiment, the observables are the components of the macroscopic nuclear\nmagnetization, which are proportional to the average values of the nuclear spin operators\nhI\u03b1 i, \u03b1 = x, y, z:\nM\u03b1 = h\u03bc\u03b1 i \u221d tr(\u03c1 I\u03b1 )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the density operator. In the high temperature approxiamtion, ~\u03c9L \u001c kB T , \u03c1 can\nbe written as:\n\u03c1\u2248\n\n1\nI + \u000f\u2206\u03c1\n2n\n\n(2)\n\nn being the number of qubits, \u000f = ~\u03c9L /kB T \u223c 10\u22125 is the ratio between the magnetic and\nthermal energies of the system, and \u2206\u03c1 the traceless deviation matrix. In a quadrupolar\nspin system, the time evolution of the system magnetization, M (t), is obtained considering\nthe following propagator\nU = e\u2212\n\niHt\n~\n\n(3)\n\nin which\nH = HZ + HQ ,\n\n(4)\n\nHZ and HQ are the Zeeman and the quadrupolar hamiltonian respectively. This hamiltonian\nis diagonal on the I2 and Iz eigenstates basis. Thus, because only the deviation matrix in\nEq.(2) evolves under the influence of the propagator U ,\n\u2206\u03c1 (t) = U \u2206\u03c1\u0303 U \u2020 .\nWhere we considered \u2206\u03c1(0) = \u2206\u03c1\u0303 (see Appendix A for details).\n\n3\n\n(5)\n\n\fThe expression for the evolution of the transverse magnetization can be obtained from\nthe expected value of the I+ operator. However, for a reason that will be clarified later, an\n\u03b1 phase factor will be considered:\n\b\nM (t) = tr U \u2206\u03c1\u0303 U \u2020 I+ ei\u03b1\n\n(6)\n\nIn Appendix A we show that \u2206\u03c1\u0303 can be expanded in the polarization operator Tl,m basis as:\n\u2206\u03c1\u0303 =\n\n\u03c0\n\nal,m ei(\u03c6\u2212 2 )(m\u2212m ) dlm0 ,m (\u2212\u03b8) Tl,m0 .\n\nX\n\n0\n\n(7)\n\nl,m,m0\n\nThus, inserting Eq.(7) into Eq.(6) and using the trace properties, we have:\nM (t) =\n\nX\n\n\b\n\u03c0\n0\nal,m ei(\u03c6\u2212 2 )(m\u2212m ) dlm0 ,m (\u2212\u03b8) tr Tl,m0 U \u2020 I+ U ei\u03b1 .\n\n(8)\n\nl,m,m0\n\nThis expression can be simplified using the properties of the polarization operators Tl,m\n[29](see Appendix B),\n[Tl,m0 ]r,s = [Tl,m0 ]r,s \u03b4r,s+m0 .\n\n(9)\n\n[I+ ]s,r = [I+ ]s,r \u03b4s,r+1 ,\n\n(10)\n\n\u03b4s,r+1 \u03b4r,s+m0 = \u03b4m0 ,\u22121 ,\n\n(11)\n\nUsing that\n\nwe obtain, for the delta product\n\nthat simplifies the magnetization to\n\nM (t) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c0\n\nal,m ei(\u03c6\u2212 2 )(m+1)+i\u03b1 dl\u22121,m (\u2212\u03b8)\n\nX\n\nEs\nt\n~\n\n(12)\n\nr,s\n\nl,m\n\nWhere \u03bbs = e\u2212i\n\n\u03bb\u2217s \u03bbr [I+ ]s,r [Tl,\u22121 ]r,s .\n\n, and the \u03bb\u2217s \u03bbr = e\u2212i\n\nEr \u2212Es\nt\n~\n\nprovides the oscillation with Bohr frequencies.\n\nThe term dl\u22121,m (\u2212\u03b8) is the reduced Wigner function, which gives the dependence on the\nnutation angle \u03b8. Hence, it is possible to maximize the magnetization by choosing \u03b8 that\nmake dl\u22121,m maximum. Using the properties (B5), (B2), and the hermiticiy of the density\noperator, we obtain\nal,m = (\u22121)m a\u2217l,\u2212m ,\n\n4\n\n(13)\n\n\fit is possible to make the index change m \u2192 \u2212m (the summation of m runs over a symmetrical range, |m| \u2264 l), so the final magnetization expression is reached:\n\nM (t) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c0\na\u2217l,m ei(1\u2212m)(\u03c6\u2212 2 )+i\u03b1 dl1,m\n\n(\u2212\u03b8)\n\nX\n\n\u03bb\u2217s \u03bbr\n\nh i\n\u2020\n[I+ ]s,r Tl,1\n\nr,s\n\nl,m\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nr,s\n\nFrom the definitions:\nfs,r \u2261 \u03bb\u2217s \u03bbr ,\n\n(15)\n\nh i\n\u2020\n[Al ]s,r \u2261 [I+ ]s,r Tl,1\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nr,s\n\nand\n\nSs,r \u2261\n\nX\n\n\u03c0\n\na\u2217l,m ei(1\u2212m)(\u03c6\u2212 2 )+i\u03b1 dl1,m (\u2212\u03b8) [Al ]s,r ,\n\n(17)\n\nl,m\n\nwe may write\n\nM (t) =\n\nX\n\nfs,r Ss,r .\n\n(18)\n\ns,r\n\nB.\n\nDensity matrix tomography\n\nWith the magnetization written in terms of a sum involving the contributions of different\norders of density matrix coherences, it is possible to design a coherence selection scheme, i.e.\nto write the NMR signal in terms of a single coherence order. Thus, the coherence selection\nwas done with the temporal average of several signals with the form\n\nS r,s\n\nNp \u22121\n1 X\n=\nSr,s (\u03c6n , \u03b1n ) .\nNp n=0\n\n(19)\n\nInserting Eq.(17) in Eq.(19), we obtain\n\nS r,s\n\nNp \u22121\n1 X X \u2217 i(1\u2212m)(\u03c6n \u2212 \u03c02 )+i\u03b1n l\n=\na e\nd1,m (\u2212\u03b8) [Al ]s,r .\nNp n=0 l,m l,m\n\nWith the angles \u03c6n and \u03b1n parametrized as\n\n5\n\n(20)\n\n\fn\n\u03c0\n+ ,\nNp 2\n(m0 \u2212 1)\n\u03b1n = 2\u03c0n\n,\nNp\n\u03c6n = 2\u03c0\n\n(21)\n\nthe summation over n simplifies to\nX\n\n2\u03c0i Nn (m0 \u2212m)\n\ne\n\np\n\n= Np \u03b4m,m0 , Np \u2265 1 + m0\n\n(22)\n\nn\n\nand Eq. (20) reduces to\nS r,r+1 (m0 ) =\n\nX\n\na\u2217l,m0 dl1,m0 (\u2212\u03b8) [Al ]r,r+1 .\n\n(23)\n\nl\n\nIt becomes evident now why the phase \u03b1 was inserted in Eq. (6) to permit the emergence\nof the Kronecker delta. Notice that has to be set to the correct value during the signal.\nSince the operator T0,0 \u221d I is not accessible through NMR experiments, the latter equation\nwill be rewritten with the auxiliar variable l0 :\n\n0\n\nS r,r+1 (m ) =\n\n2S\nX\n\na\u2217l,m0 dl1,m0 (\u2212\u03b8) [Al ]r,r+1\n\nl=l0\n0\n\nl = {1, m0 }.\n\n(24)\n\nThis expression corresponds to the linear system\n\nAX = B\n\n(25)\n\nwith\n\n[A]i,l\u2212l0 +1 = [Al ]i,i+1 ,\n[X]l\u2212l0 +1 = a\u2217l,m0 dl1,m0 (\u2212\u03b8) ,\n[B]i = S i,i+1 (m0 ) ,\nwhere\n6\n\n(26)\n\n\fi = 1, 2, ..., 2S\nl = l0 , l0 + 1, ..., 2S.\n\n(27)\n\nTherefore, for each average value, the respective coefficients al,m0 (with m0 fixed) can be\nfound. Because of the density operator hermiticity, only the coefficients for m0 \u2265 0 need to\nbe considered. To solve the system of equations, the least mean square method was used .\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL TOMOGRAPHY TESTS\n\nIn order to verify the efficiency of the tomography method for quadrupolar nuclei and\nthe influence of experimental aspects in the method performance, some simple tests were\nperformed. Those tests refer to the quadrupolar interaction influence of the sample, inhomogeneity of the radio-frequency field, and possible imprecision arising from the pulse\ncalibration process. The sample used was cesium pentadecafluorooctanoate (CsPFO) and\nthe nuclei observed was Cesium-133, wich has a spin of 7/2. The sample was dissolved in\nheavy water to the concentration of 37,5%. When the sample is placed in the magnet the\nliquid crystal miscels align with the field and, then, display an aerage internal electric field\ngradient. This will result in the following quadrupolar hamiltonian for the Cesium nuclei:\nHq =\n\n\u0001\n~\u03c9q\n3Iz2 \u2212 I 2 .\n6\n\n(28)\n\nThe \u03c9q is the quadrupolar frequency and its value is highly dependent on the sample\ntemperature. Therefore, the sample temperature must be kept constant. The measurements\nwere performed on a 400 MHz magnet using a 5 mm CP/MAS probe and a VARIAN Inova\nUnity spectrometer.\n\nA.\n\nEquilibrium, Iy and even order coherence states creation\n\nIn the base of Tl,m , the index m refers to contributions over the density operator for the\nm super-diagonal elements. For example, the m = 1 term has only the first superdiagonal\nterms non-null, independently of the rank l. The first test described is the acquisition of the\nequilibrium state Iz , which has all off diagonal null elements (it is proportional to T1,0 ). In\n7\n\n\forder to do so, we only need to keep the sample in the static magnetic field long enough for\nthe spins to allign with it and then apply the tomography pulses. In the next test, the Iy\nstate is created by applying a ( \u03c02 )\u2212x pulse on the equilibrium state. As Iy have only the first\n(imaginary) sub and super-diagonal non-null elements, after the tomography sequence, only\nthe spectrum corresponding to the first coherence (m = 1) will have non-zero intensities.\nThe even order coherence test consists of creating states which have only pre-determined\ncoherence orders by applying a pulse sequence composed of hard pulses and free evolution\nintervals. First, it is necessary to demonstrate that the free evolution changes the rank l,\nwhile the pulses change the coherence order m. To go from m to m0 , it is required that first\nthe rank be changed from l to m0 , always obeying the constraints for the Tl,m :\n\nm = \u2212l, \u2212l + 1, ..., l \u2212 1, l\nl = 0, 1, ..., 2S.\n\n1.\n\nChanging the rank\n\nFor free evolutions, in the rotating frame on resonance, the evolution operator will be\nUe = e\u2212i\n\nHQ\nt\n~\n\n, HQ =\n\n\u0003\n~\u03c9Q \u0002 2\n3Iz \u2212 I(I + 1)I .\n6\n\n(29)\n\nHere, if the Tl,m operator evolves under the effect of Ue , the resulting Tel,m will be given\nby\nT\u0303l,m = Ue Tl,m Ue\u2020 =\n\nX\n\nbl,l0 Tl0 ,m .\n\n(30)\n\nl0\n\nThus, the information about the presence of the Tl0 ,m component is in the bl,l0 coefficient,\nwich may be evaluated by the projection of T\u0303l,m over TL,m :\nn\nHQ o\nHQ\n\u2020\nbl,L = tr TL,m\ne\u2212i ~ t Tl,m ei ~ t\n\n(31)\n\nFor the rank transfer experiments, it is necessary to find the free evolution time te for\nwhich the absolute value of bl,L is maximum.

Thus, the angle for which those functions are maximized should\nbe the more convenient choice. However, even with the change to Eq. (14), that can lead\nto long pulses, making the pulse imperfections more severe and the tomography process\nless precise because selective excitation effects can start to show in the pulses mainly for\nlarge quadrupolar coupling. An alternative is to find angles that not necessarily maximize\nthe dl1,m (\u2212\u03b8) function in particular, but those that for a given m make the values of these\nfunctions in relation to two or more values of l high enough for a considerable sensibility for\nthis component. Thus, we used the tomography angles on the table I, which were selected\nbased on this criteria. In the test analysis the following convention was adopted: F E \u2261\nfidelity between the experimental state and its theoretical equivalent; F S \u2261 fidelity between\nthe experimental state and the simulation. For the simulations, a \u03b5 parameter related with\nthe pulse precision was multiplied by the pulse intensity.

We wish\nthen to demonstrate the possibility of performing a complete quantum algorithm in this\nsystem using the SMP technique [28]. However, before the implementation of the quantum\nalgorithm we wish to demonstrate the construction of the pseudo-pure states used as the\ncomputational base. They will be the starting point of every algorithm. First we optimized\nthe SMP pulse sequences for the preparation of the computational base states from |000i\nto |111i. The optmization was designed to employ four temporal averages, each one with\nten segments. In Fig. 4, the experimental density matrices obtained through the quantum\nstate tomography process are shown for each state, also with the corresponding simulated\nmatrices that were expected.\nTable III gives the experimental fidelities corresponding to the density matrices presented\nin Fig. 4. The fidelities found during the optmization of the SMPs are very close to unity,\n12\n\n\fRe\nal\nIm\nag\n\n001\n\n010\n\n011\n\n101\n\n110\n\n111\n\nina\n\nry\n\n100\n\nSimulated\n\nExperimental\n\nSimulated\n\nExperimental\n\n000\n\nFIG. 4: Experimental density matrices and their respective expected simulated density matrices\n\nbut as it can be seen, the experimental fidelities will always have a smaller value. That can\nbe caused by experimental errors such as the ones described in previous section: a) pulse\ncalibration; b) lack of spatial homogeneity of the B1 field of the RF pulses; c) limitations\nof the temporal, phase and amplitude resolution of the spectrometer; d) errors due to the\nresponse time of the RF coil during the rapid variations of power levels required by the\nSMP; e) relaxation processes during the pulse application.\nAmong these different types of erros, there are some that are more influencing on the final\nresult. From the simulations it was possible to determine which ones were more effective\nin reducing the fidelity of the measurements. The calibration errors are a strong factor in\n13\n\n\fTABLE III: Fidelity of the computational base states created\nState Experimental fidelity (%)\n|000i\n\n82,5\n\n|001i\n\n93,8\n\n|010i\n\n95,2\n\n|011i\n\n95,8\n\n|100i\n\n92,8\n\n|101i\n\n88,8\n\n|110i\n\n91,1\n\n|111i\n\n87,2\n\nthe results. As demonstrated by the simulations, a 5% calibration error may result in a\n30% loss in fidelity. This shows the importance of a very precise pulse calibration. The\ninhomogeneity of the RF pulses is another important factor, but in this case not as much\nas the RF coil response time. The rapid variation of the SMPs amplitudes (sharp edges) is\nnot sometimes well reproduced by the RF coil and this greatly reduces the fidelity. One way\naround this is forcing an SMP optimization that favors sequences with smooth amplitude\ntransitions.\nAn important thing to notice about the use of the SMP here is that the pulse durations\nfor the creation of these states lie between 100 to 300 \u03bcs. If transition-selective pulses were\nused, the duration would be of the order of miliseconds.\n\nB.\n\nLogic Gates Implementation using SMP\n\nThe next set of experiments we present consist of the logic gates implementation. For\nthat purpose, we created a SMP that represents a logic gate and applied it to some of the\ncomputational base states. Then, we used the quantum state tomography method to check\nthe output of the logic gate. The SMP pulse sequences for the gates were optimized with 25\nsegments and the optmization process took about 10 minutes to reach fidelities over 99.99%.\nWe chose to present here the results obtained for the Toffolli gates, since they are more\ngraphically representative.\n\n14\n\n\fTABLE IV: Toffolli gate fidelities.\nOperation\n\nFidelity (%)\n\nToffolli1 |010i\n\n63,3\n\nToffolli1 |111i\n\n69,7\n\nToffolli2 |100i\n\n62,6\n\nToffolli2 |101i\n\n66,2\n\nToffolli3 |110i\n\n43,3\n\nToffolli3 |101i\n\n60,3\n\nIn Fig. 5 we show the tomographed density matrices before and after the application\nof the different Toffolli gates on the states |000i, |001i, |010i, |100i, |011i and |111i.

This demonstrates the correct performance of\nthe SMP. To perform logic gates using transition-selective pulses on a I = 7/2 nuclear spin\nsystem, about 2 ms are required for the pulse duration. The SMP we used were at most 300\n15\n\n\f\u03bcs long and therefore the 10 ms relaxation time for our sample has a negligible effect.\n\nC.\n\nDeutsch-Jozsa Algorithm\n\nWith the use of SMPs it was possible to implement the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm [30].\nHere we present the result for two cases: one in which the tested function is balanced and\none in which it is constant. In the case of a constant function the final result will be the\nstate |000i or |001i and any other state if the function is balanced. In Fig. 6 the two results\nare shown. The constant function corresponded to one that always returned 1 for any input\nstate. The balanced function returned 0 for the states |00i and |10i and returned 1 for the\nstates |01i e |11i. Thus, the final state of those constant and balanced functions is |001i\nand |011i respectively. We can visually recognize that the expected states are found in the\nexperimental data, demonstrating the successful application of the SMP.\n\nBalanced Function\n\nImaginary\n\nReal\n\nConstant Function\n\nFIG. 6: Experimental density matrices obtained after the application of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm for a case of a constant and a case of balanced function. The final states should be |001i\n(constant) and |011i (balanced)\n\nTable V displays the experimental fidelity of the data obtained. The low fidelity values are\nattributed to the many experimental erros involved. Still, the final state is easily indentified.\nIf conventional pulses were used, a sequence of at least 5 ms would be necessary to perform\nthe algorithm, which would render it useless due to relaxation effects. Also a great analytical\neffort would be required to design a sequence that was the most efficient as possible.\n\n16\n\n\fTABLE V: Fidelity of the results obtained after the Deutsch-Jozsa SMP application\n\nD.\n\nState\n\nExperimental Fidelity (%)\n\nDeutsch-Jozsa fc\n\n64,3\n\nDeutsch-Jozsa fb\n\n65\n\nGrover Algorithm\n\nOur last result was the implementation of the Grover algorithm [31]. This is an algorithm\n\u221a\nwith practical uses, in which there is a N order gain compared to the classical equivalent.\nFigure 7 shows the experimental data obtained for two cases of the algorithm.

In theory, the final result has a 97% probability that it will return the state we were\nsearching for. Amidst all our experimental errors, this is of little concern in our final results.\nOn the experimental data, we can identify the states we were looking for even though the\nfidelities were not as high as desired. The fidelities are recorded in Table VI. Due to all the\nexperimental errors involved, these fidelities are as high as expected.\nWe were able to check the performance of the SMP once again for another algorithm.\nJust as in the earlier cases, if we were to employ conventional pulses we would need a very\n17\n\n\fTABLE VI: Fidelities for the Grover algorithm\nState\n\nExperimental (%)\n\nGrover011\n\n52\n\nGrover100\n\n52\n\nlong pulse sequence (greater than the relaxation time) and also a great analytical effort to\ndesign it.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe QST method applied met the requirements of duration and precision of our system.\nThat could be shown from the small differences between the simulated and experimental\nresults. This could be evidenced by the tomography of the following states:\n\u2022 Iz : The result is close to perfection, but this state has only coherences of 0 order, and\ntherefore it is not a good parameter for the tomography method analysis.\n\u2022 I\u02c6y : Experimentally, it is possible to see the emerging of contributions on the real part\nwith coherences of order 1 and, on the imaginary part, of coherences of order 2 (with\nmuch smaller intensities); yet, the most intense elements are exactly those that we\nexpect theoretically.\n\u2022 Even order coherence: The elements that were theoretically expected can all be seen.\nThe simulations with the introduction of the experimental imperfections, reproduced\nvery well the real part observed experimentally.\nThe construction of the computational base states was achieved with fidelity greater than\n80%, which is a good indication of the efficiency of the method. In the case of logic gates,\nthe fidelities fall to the order of 60%, as expected due to the concatenation of SMP. In\nthe same way, we find fidelities between 50% and 60% for the quantum algorithms. We\nhave successfully shown the advantages and experimental applications of SMP for quantum\ninformation processing in 3 q-bit systems composed of 7/2 spin nuclei. The experimental\ndata shows us that SMP allow us to perform logic operations in a time scale ten times smaller\nthan with conventional pulses [15]. The implementation of complete quantum algorithms\n18\n\n\fwas only made possible through the use of SMP. All the data was acquired through the\nquantum state tomography sequence which also had its efficiency tested. Both SMP and the\nquantum state tomography have many applications in NMR outside the scope of quantum\ninformation processing. SMP can make designing a pulse sequence a much simpler task\nwithout any analitical effort and sequences with much shorter duration and selectivity can\nbe achieved through the use of SMP.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank FAPESP, CAPES and CNPQ for financial support throughout\nthis reasearch.\n\n19\n\n\fz\n\nn(\u0398,\u03a6)\n\n^\n\n\u0398\n\n\u03a9\n\ny\n\u03a6\nx\n\nFIG. 8: Simplified description of the rotations\nAppendix A\n1.\n\nRotations over the density operator\n\nTo describe the rotations over the \u2206\u03c1\u0302 operator, it will be expand in an ortonormal basis\nformed by the polarization operators {Tl,m (S)} [29]:\n\n\u2206\u03c1 =\n\nl\n2S X\nX\n\nal,m Tl,m .\n\n(A1)\n\nl=1 m=\u2212l\n\nApplying the rotation operator D (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) to the last expression,\nD (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) \u2206\u03c1\u0302D\u2020 (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) =\n\nX\n\nal,m e\u2212im\u03b3\n\nl,m\n\nX\n\n0\n\ne\u2212im \u03b1 dlm0 ,m (\u03b2) Tl,m0 .\n\n(A2)\n\nm0\n\nAny rotation of a coordenate system which takes (x, y, z) to (x0 , y 0 , z 0 ) can be treated as\na rotation of an angle \u03a9 around the n (\u0398, \u03a6) axis, where \u0398 and \u03a6 are the same in both\nsystems [29], as illustred in the figure 8.\nThe Euler angles (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) and the (\u03a9, \u0398, \u03a6) angles are connected by:\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03a9\n\u03b2\n\u03b1+\u03b3\ncos\n= cos\ncos\n,\n2\n2\n2\n\u0001\ntan \u03b22\n\u0001,\ntan \u0398 =\nsin \u03b1+\u03b3\n2\n20\n\n(A3)\n\n\f\u03a6 =\n\n\u03c0 \u03b1\u2212\u03b3\n+\n.\n2\n2\n\nFor a rotation axis constrained in the transversal plane, \u0398 =\n\n\u03c0\n.\n2\n\nIf the nutation axis\n\nmakes a \u03c6 angle with the x axis, \u03a6 = \u03c6.
