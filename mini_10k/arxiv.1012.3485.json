The results would be considered as a universal approach of the self-Compton\nemission of relativistic electrons moving in curved magnetic fields, and thus could\nbe applied to many astrophysical phenomena, including GRBs, active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs), and pulsars.\nKey words: radiation mechanisms: nonthermal - radiation mechanisms: general relativity < Physical Data and Processes\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTraditionally, non-thermal radiation mechanisms of electrons in astrophysical environments are Bremsstrahlung,\nsynchrotron radiation, curvature radiation, and inverse\nCompton scattering (e.g. see Blumenthal & Gould 1970,\nand Rybicki & Lightman 1979). Bremsstrahlung radiation\nis the result of collisions between charged particles, and has\na continuous spectrum. Synchrotron emission arises from\nrelativistic electrons moving around straight magnetic field\nlines, while curvature emission is radiated by electrons moving along curved field lines, and can be used to discuss the\nradiation from pulsar magnetosphere and AGNs (e.g., Cocke\n& Pacholczyk 1975). The formulae for calculating the characteristic frequencies and spectral energy distributions of\nthese two radiation mechanisms are similar, while in the\nequations for curvature radiation the curvature radius replaces the cyclotron radius in the synchrotron radiation. In\nthe high energy regime, the inverse-Compton scattering usually plays an important role. This type of emission occurs\nwhen relativistic electrons scatter low energy photons.\nFor electrons with a power law distribution of Lorentz\nfactors, which are easily produced in astrophysical situations (e.g. products of shock acceleration, see Fermi 1949\n\n\u22c6\n\nzhangbo@nju.edu.cn\n\u2020 dzg@nju.edu.cn\n\nand Grupen et al. 2005), the spectra of the resulting synchrotron and curvature radiations are also in the form of\npower laws. The difference is that, due to different relationships between Lorentz factor and critical frequency, their\nspectral power law indices for the same index p of electrons\nare not the same. The self-Compton emissions of these two\nradiation mechanisms have spectral shapes similar to that\nof seeds. Thus power law spectra, which are quite common\nunder astrophysical conditions, are explained. If seed photons are from synchrotron radiation, which is the so-called\nsynchrotron self-Compton radiation, a similar spectrum to\nthe synchrotron seed is expected in this situation.\nThe synchro-curvature radiation depicting the spectrum emitted by electrons moving around curved magnetic\nfield lines was first proposed by Zhang & Cheng (1995,\n1996); Cheng & Zhang (1996), with a full set of formulae\ndepicting the radiation spectrum, radiation power, characteristic frequency as well as polarization degree derived.\nThe purpose of considering this radiation mechanism is to\ngive some insights into new results which could not be interpreted well with conventional mechanisms only. The related quantum radiation equations for a single electron were\ngiven by Zhang & Yuan (1998), and the spectra from electrons with a power law energy distribution was calculated\nby Zhang et al. (2000). Harko & Cheng (2002) gave further\ndiscussions on electrons with larger transverse drifting velocities. As pointed out by Lieu & Axford (1997), the synchro-\n\n\f2\n\nBo Zhang and Zi-Gao Dai\n\ncurvature radiation should be considered as a more realistic\ntreatment to the radiations by electrons in the universe.\nNaturally, synchrotron and curvature radiations are\nthe two limits of synchro-curvature radiation: the curvature radius is infinite for synchrotron radiation, while the\nelectrons's cyclotron radius is zero for curvature radiation.\nThe synchro-curvature radiation can be treated as a unified mechanism arising from relativistic electrons, and thus\ncan be applied to general researches related to astrophysical\nradiations. It has already been used by to interpret radiation theories of pulsars by Zhang & Cheng (1997, 1998);\nCheng & Zhang (1998); Hirotani et al. (2003), the energy\nexcess of active galactic nuclei by Xia & Zhang (2001), as\nwell as spectral observations of high energy photons from\ngamma-ray bursts observed in the Compton Gamma-Ray\nObservatory (CGRO) Era by Deng et al. (2005). As noted\nin Zhang et al. (2000), due to the non-power law items in the\nformulae describing the synchro-curvature radiation power,\nthe spectrum is significantly deviated from all of the \"traditional\" mechanisms. Besides, the polarization degrees of\nsynchro-curvature, synchrotron and curvature radiations are\nquite different from each other. So, from observed spectral\nshapes and the polarization measurements, one should distinguish between these three radiation mechanisms.\nHowever, the synchro-curvature radiation alone cannot lead to a complete picture. As noted in Zhang et al.\n(2000), some other effects, such as the Compton scattering of this radiation mechanism, needs to be studied. Up to\nnow synchro-curvature related inverse-Compton scattering\nhas remained undiscussed. In this paper we calculate the\nspectrum of synchro-curvature self-Compton (SCSC) radiation, which makes the scheme of synchro-curvature radiation more complete, and present a more realistic approach\nto cosmic electron scattering. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work on the SCSC radiation mechanism. The structure of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 basic\nequations of both synchro-curvature radiation and its selfCompton scattering are presented. In section 3 we show our\nnumerical calculation results with various parameters, along\nwith considerations of electron cooling, drifting and high energy Klein-Nishina cutoff. We carry out these calculations\nmainly for the case of gamma ray bursts, since these violent\nexplosions are representatives of high energy astrophysical\nevents, and can provide an extreme environment to discuss\nthe high energy radiations. Our results are summarized in\nsection 4.\n\n(1996) and Zhang et al.

Thus\nfor power-law distributed relativistic electrons with distribution index p, the emissivity J\u03bd could be calculated according to following equations based on Zhang et al.

The circular magnetic field lines with constant curvature radius are\nassumed for simplicity in all of our calculations. Of course\nthis is just a simplified treatment. In real situations, the curvature radius of a magnetic field line may vary from place\nto place, and thus the spectra will change accordingly. However, the basic equations for calculation remain the same.\nAll we need to do then is to replace the curvature radius of\nfield line with instant value.\nFirst we present equations ignoring the electrons' drifts.\nAs given in Zhang & Cheng (1995, 1996); Cheng & Zhang\n\nJ\u22a5 (\u03bd)\n\n=\n\n\u221a\n\n3e2 9c2\n8\u03c0 2 4\n\n+K2/3\nJk (\u03bd)\n\n=\n\n\u221a\n\n3e2\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u2212K2/3\n\nZ\n\nN0 \u03b3\n\n\u0010 \u03bd \u0011io\n\u03bdc\n\n\u2212p+7\n\n\u00d7\n\nN0 \u03b3 \u2212p+1\n\n\u0010 \u03bd \u0011io\n\u03bdc\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u03bdc2\n\n\u001a\n\n\u03bd\n\u03bdc\n\n\u0014Z\n\n\u03bd\n\u03bdc\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0014Z\n\nK5/3 (y) dy\n\n\u03bd/\u03bdc\n\na0 \u03b3 + a1 +\n\n\u001a\n\n\u221e\n\na2\n\u03b3\n\n\u221e\n\n\u00133\n\nd\u03b3,\n\nK5/3 (y) dy\n\n\u03bd/\u03bdc\n\na2\na0 \u03b3 + a1 +\n\u03b3\n\n\u0013\n\nd\u03b3,\n\nwhere we replace the circular frequency \u03c9 with angular frequency \u03bd = \u03c9/2\u03c0 for convenience. The above two equations give the emissivity in two polarizations, with a0 =\n\n\fSynchro-Curvature Self-Compton Radiation\nme c2 sin2 \u03b1 cos2 \u03b1\n,\neB\u03c12\n\n3\n\n2\n\nsin \u03b1\na1 = cos\u03c1 \u03b1 , and a2 = eB\n.

This idea\nthat charged particles can have different motion in inhomogeneous magnetic field has already been proposed several decades ago (e.g., see Chugunov et al. 1975), while\nthe unified formulae for single relativistic electron's synchrocurvature radiation spectrum with electrons' transverse drift\nvelocity considered was given by Harko & Cheng (2002) as\nfollows:\n\ndP\nd\u03bd\n\n\u221a\n\n2\n1 2\n\u03b3me B vk + 2 v\u22a5\n3e3\n2\n2\nB\nsin\n\u03b1\n+\n2\nsin \u03b1\nme c2\ne\n\u03c1\n\n=\n\n\u0014\n\n2\n1 2\n\u03b3 2 m2 vk + 2 v\u22a5\n+ 2e\ne\n\u03c12\n\n\u00012 #1/2\n\nF\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03bd\n\u03bdc\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nFigure 1.

It can be clearly seen that due to electrons' drift,\nthe spectral shape and flux are changed significantly. Similar\nto the calculations for non-drifting electrons, the emissivity\nof power law distributed electrons can be easily derived from\nEq.(3), with electrons' distribution function multiplied with\nsingle electron's spectrum.\nIn Figure 1 we present the ratio between radiation powers at characteristic frequency of synchro-curvature radiation without and with the consideration of electrons' transverse drift velocity with the various B and \u03c1 used below. We\nfix the Lorentz factor as \u03b3 = 3 \u00d7 103 , which is typical for\ngamma ray bursts. It can be seen that the relation between\nthe ratio and the magnetic field, especially between the ratio\nand B is quite complex.\nSimilar to other traditional radiation mechanisms, the\nsynchro-curvature radiation may show self absorption features in the low energy part in some situations.

We take Eq.(2) and Eq.(3) as low energy seed\nspectra to calculate the self-Compton spectrum of synchrocurvature radiation, and consider the possible effects of self\nabsorption. The IC emissivity can be expressed as (e.g. Sari\n& Esin 2001)\nj\u03bdIC = 3\u03c3T\n\nZ\n\n\u03b3max\n\nd\u03b3N (\u03b3)\n\n\u03b3m\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ndxf\u03bd\u2020s (x) g (x)\n\n(6)\n\n0\n\nwith x = 4\u03b3\u03bd2 \u03bds and g (x) = 1 + x + 2x ln x \u2212 2x2 . Here\nf\u03bd\u2020s means the incident specific flux of frequency \u03bds at the\nscattering region, and can be related with the original seed\n4\u03c0R2\nflux f\u03bds by the formula f\u03bds = f\u03bd\u2020s 4\u03c0D\n2 , with R being the\nradius of the scattering region and D being the distance to\nthe observer. And \u03bd is the frequency of IC scattering, while\n\u03bds is the frequency of the incident seed emission.\nThe formulae above are only suitable in the Thomson limit.

The characteristic frequency of SCSC is no longer\n\n\f4\n\nBo Zhang and Zi-Gao Dai\n\na simple power law function of the electron Lorentz factor.\nOn the contrary, since different item dominates in different\nband, the relationship between characteristic frequency\nand Lorentz factor can be quite complex. Zhang et al.\n(2000) have already shown that the seed synchro-curvature\nradiation spectra arising from a power-law distributed\nelectrons are quite different from simple power law. Thus, a\nsimilar deviation is expected for SCSC.\n\n3\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nIn the calculations below, we suppose that all of the electrons are distributed isotropically for simplicity. In order to\ncalculate the modified Bessel functions of fractional order in\nthe equations in Section 2, we adopt the code provided by\nChapter 6 of Press et al. (1992).\nIn the calculations we mainly consider the situation of\ngamma-ray bursts. GRBs are the strongest explosions in the\nuniverse since the Big Bang, and the existence of strong\nmagnetic fields as well as relativistic electrons are implied\nboth observationally and theoretically (e.g., see Piran 1999).\nFor this reason, such events are often considered as laboratory to test some high energy process in astrophysics.\nDeng et al. (2005) applied the synchro-curvature radiation\nto interpret the high energy excess observed by CGRO, and\ngot reasonable fitting results compared with other works using traditional radiation mechanisms (e.g., see Tavani 1996).\nThe advantage of their work is that, by introducing the\nsynchro-curvature radiation, the number of free parameters\ncan be reduced, thus a more convenient treatment can be\nachieved. Here we adopt the parameters similar to the fittings listed in Deng et al. (2005). As noted in Piran (1999)\nand Guetta & Granot (2003), typically speaking, the bulk\nLorentz factor of GRBs is \u0393 \u223c 102 \u2212 103 , magnetic field\nB \u223c 104 , and electrons' minimum Lorentz factor \u03b3min \u223c\n102 \u2212 103 . The\u0002 fitting\u0003results provided\u0002 by Deng\n\u0003 et al. (2005)\n3\n2\n/\u03c1 8 \u223c 10, where\nare around \u0393 \u03b3min\nB 12 \u223c 10 and \u0393 \u03b3min\n\u0002 2\n\u0003\n\u0002 3\n\u0003\n\u0001\n2\n3\n\u03b3min B 12 = \u03b3min\nB/1012 and \u03b3min\n/\u03c1 8 = \u03b3min\n/\u03c1 /108 .\nThese results yield relatively small curvature radius of\nmagnetic field. In theory, several magnetic field configuration models have been proposed for GRBs. As noted in\nRossi et al. (2004), one of the most popular models is that,\nthe magnetic field in the GRB jets can be produced by the\nshock, and are compressed into a thin layer normal to the\npropagation direction. Since the field in such a layer is highly\ntangled, small scale variations of magnetic field (therefore\nsmall value for field's characteristic curvature radius \u03c1) can\nbe achieved. Some numerical simulations on GRB magnetic\nfield involving the two stream (Weibel) instability also give\nrise to similar long-lasting field structure, especially in internal shocks. (e.g. see Medvedev & Loeb 1999, Medvedev et\nal. 2005 and references herein). And according to Medvedev\n(2000) and Mizuno et al. (2010), small scale structures of\nfields can dominate in the case of GRBs. In such situations, it is possible that synchro-curvature radiation as well\nas SCSC can play an important role in shaping the GRBs'\nspectrum.\nFirst we show the seed spectra samples in Figure 2.\nThe solid line, dotted line and dashed line correspond to\nthe spectrum of synchro-curvature radiation, synchrotron\nradiation, and curvature radiation respectively.\n\nFigure 2. Spectra of synchro-curvature radiation (solid line),\nsynchrotron radiation (dashed line), and curvature radiation (dotted line) with magnetic field B = 104 Gauss, curvature radius of\nfield B \u03c1 = 103 cm, minimum electron Lorentz factor \u03b3min = 103 ,\nmaximum Lorentz factor \u03b3max = 104 , and electron distribution\nindex p = 5. Fluxes are in arbitrary unit.\n\nFigure 3. Self Compton spectra of synchro-curvature radiation\n(solid line), synchrotron radiation (dashed line), and curvature\nradiation (dotted line). Parameters are the same as in Figure 1.\n\nFrom Figure 2, we can see that for synchrotron radiation\nrising from electrons with power law distribution of Lorentz\nfactors, the spectral index should be (p \u2212 1) /2 (where p is\nthe power law index of electrons). While for curvature radiation, the index is (p \u2212 2) /3. However, due to polynomial\nitems in the synchro-curvature radiation formulae, the resulting spectrum cannot be described with a single power\nlaw. Thus a turnoff is expected for self-Compton emission,\nand corresponding to a point where a different item in the\npolynome dominates. Roughly speaking, this is the point\nwhen a0 \u03b3 = a2 /\u03b3. Figure 3 shows the corresponding IC\nspectrum of Figure 2.\nFigures 2 and 3 show the spectra of electrons with a\nlarge power law index (p = 5). For shock acceleration which\nis common in astrophysical circumstances, electrons usually\nhave a smaller index, p \u223c 2 \u2212 2.5. We present calculational\nresults for such electrons in Figure 4.\nIt is noted that for a smaller index p, the spectrum\ndoesn't show a significant turnoff. We try to find some explanations for this phenomena. In the seed spectrum, synchrotron and curvature radiations have different spectral in-\n\n\fSynchro-Curvature Self-Compton Radiation\n\nFigure 4. Synchro-curvature radiation (solid line), synchrotron\nradiation (dashed line), and curvature radiation (dotted line)\nspectra (left) and corresponding self Compton spectra (right) for\nelectron collective with p = 2.5. Other parameters are the same\nas in Figure 1.\n\ndex \u03b1. Although the synchro-curvature emission is not a\nsimple addition to the former two traditional radiation spectra, we can see that the synchro-curvature spectrum can be\nconsidered as a summation of synchrotron and curvature\nplus the coupling items. If electrons can have cyclotron radius value similar to magnetic field's curvature radius (which\nmean the contributions from synchrotron and curvature radiations are comparable with each other), as well as large difference between spectral indices for synchrotron and curvature radiations, the high energy turnoff can be very evident.\nFor parameters within the ranges used in our calculation, it\nis seen from Figures 2, 3 and 4 that for a smaller curvature\nradius, weaker magnetic fields and larger electron index p,\nsynchrotron and curvature radiations overlay more significantly. Since the resulting self Compton emissions have similar (although smoother) spectral shapes to seeds, turnoff\npoints are expected naturally.\nThe turnoffs can also be explained by the equations\ndescribing the resulting spectrum. The ratio of the a0 \u03b3 to\na2 /\u03b3 items of the polynomy (a0 \u03b3 + a1 + a2 /\u03b3) can change a\nlot across the observed energies. So the spectral index may\nchange from one frequency range to another. Comparing\ntheir relative values, we can get an overall idea of the position of the turnoff point. Figure 2 from Zhang et al. (2000)\ngives an example of the relationship between the magnetic\nfield B and the energy of turnoff point. For self-Compton\nscattering a similar relationship is expected.\nBesides, if we change \u03b3max to a larger value, the shape\nof the high energy turnoff can also be affected. Usually the\nlarger \u03b3max , the longer the excess part. The exact value\nof \u03b3max is related to the particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms, e.g., in the case of gamma ray bursts,\nelectrons whose shock acceleration timescale equals to cooling timescale of non-thermal radiation have the maximum\nLorentz factor (e.g, see Dai & Lu 1998). Thus the value \u03b3max\ncan be calculated. And the values of B, \u03c1 and so on also affect the final shape of the spectra: smaller B and \u03c1 lead to a\nmore significant spectral deviation from traditional IC scattering, while spectra formed in magnetic fields with larger B\nand larger curvature radius \u03c1 are nearly identical with SSC\nradiation.\nSimilar to other types of inverse Compton scattering,\nthe polarization of SCSC depends on the magnetic field\nstructure, the distribution of emitting photons, as well as\nviewing angle. Anisotropic electrons can give rise to signif-\n\n5\n\nicant polarized IC emission (e.g. see Begelman & Sikora\n1987). As noted by Beloborodov et al. (2010), usually in\nprevious works related to GRBs, isotropic electrons are assumed (e.g., see Granot et al. 1999), although this may not\nbe the real situation. With random fields, the seed spectra\nfrom the whole jet do not have large degrees of polarization;\nthe polarized signals from different regions are wiped out.\nThus one can not expect too much degrees of polarization for\nSCSC emission in the comoving frame. Since the polarization degree remains the same with Lorentz transformation,\nthe observed emission for on-axis observer does not show significant polarization either. However anisotropy emerges to\nthe off-axis observers. Thus polarization patterns for SCSC\nexist in this situation, and are differs from traditional radiation mechanisms, especially in the high energy regime,\nsince the polarization can be affected by the spectral shape.\nBesides, it is possible that non-zero polarization degree arise\nfrom the underlying field with some degree of order, that is,\nthe field is not totally random. And some works also show\nthat relativistic electrons do have some anisotropy in the comoving frame (e.g., see Achterberg et al. 2001). Some recent\nworks on GRBs have taken anisotropy of electrons into account (e.g., see Beloborodov et al. 2010), although this issue\nneed to be discussed in more details. Therefore more detailed\nsimulations may be needed to describe the real polarization\nbehavior.\nFinally we consider the self absorption effects of the\nsynchro-curvature seed spectrum. Since the absorption only\nshow significant effects in the low energy regime, changing\nthe spectra index, while the differences between SCSC and\nother traditional mechanisms are mainly in the high energy\nportion (that is, the high energy turnoff), the self absorption\neffects do not matter a lot in our discussion. So we do not\nconsider this issue in the following calculations for simplicity. In fact, for synchro-curvature seed radiation in vacuum,\nthe major absorption part is quite similar to synchrotron\nself absorption, with the spectrum proportional to \u03bd 5/2 , and\nonly a bit flatter in the higher energy part of the absorption\nregime, as noted in Yang et al. (2003). However, negative\nself absorption may occur in plasma environment, although\nstill affect the low energy part only.\n\n3.1\n\nCooling Effect of Electrons in the Case of\nGamma-Ray Bursts\n\nIntegration over the electron Lorentz factor \u03b3 is needed to\nget the whole spectrum. In the calculation of the spectra\nshown in Figures 2 to 4, a simple power law distribution is\nassumed. However, under real astrophysical circumstances,\nthe cooling effect of electrons should be considered in order\nto get an accurate spectrum, e.g., in the situation to calculate the spectrum of gamma-ray bursts (e.g., see Sari, Piran\n& Narayan 1998). Here we take this issue into account, and\ndiscuss the fast and slow cooling regimes for GRBs under\nthe framework of SCSC.\nLet p denote the initial power law index. For fast cooling\nelectrons, all of the electrons can cool down to about the\ncooling Lorentz factor (at which the cooling timescale equals\nto the dynamical timescale of the system). In this situation,\nthe distribution function should be\n\n\f6\n\nBo Zhang and Zi-Gao Dai\n\nFigure 5.

All of\nthe spectra are in arbitrary units.\n\n(9)\n\nIn Figures 7 and 8, sample spectra of slow cooling electrons are presented. It is clearly seen that the electron cooling effect makes the low energy index of electrons smaller,\nthus making the resulting spectrum nearly identical with\nsynchrotron self-Compton radiation, especially for fast cooling electrons that have a smaller low energy index. For slow\ncooling electrons with a larger low energy index, the difference between SSC and SCSC becomes more significant.\nFor other astrophysical objects, e.g., the cooling effects\ncan be different. Kardashev (1962) has given a detailed view\nof this issue.\n\n3.2\n\nSpectra of Drifting Electrons\n\nAs shown in Section 2, the resulting synchro-curvature radiation can be changed if electron drifts exist due to inhomogeneous magnetic field. The formulae describing drifting\nelectrons' spectra are quite different from the ones emitted\nby non-drifting electrons. Thus the self Compton emission\nfrom such electrons is also not the same as simple SCSC\nshown above. Here we calculate drifting electrons' synchrocurvature self Compton radiation.\nIn Figure 9 we show the seed and self Compton spectra\nof synchro-curvature radiation with and without drifts, as\nwell as the synchrotron and curvature radiations. Because of\nthe difference in the distribution of seed photons, the drifting\neffects can change the resulting SCSC spectra significantly,\nespecially in the high energy regime.\nFor non-drifting electrons, the high energy regime in the\nSCSC spectra is mainly contributed by the curvature self\nCompton radiation. The large transverse velocity can suppress the electrons' motion along magnetic field lines and\nthus suppress the curvature radiation part. Thus such deviation can be explained.\n\n\fSynchro-Curvature Self-Compton Radiation\n\nFigure 9. Spectra on the left are from the synchro-curvature radiation without drifts (solid line), the synchro-curvature radiation\nwith drifts (dash-dotted line), the synchrotron radiation (dashed\nline), and the curvature radiation (dotted line) with B = 0.5\u00d7104\nGauss, p = 5 and \u03c1 = 103 cm. The corresponding self Compton\nspectra are shown on the right. All of the spectra are in arbitrary\nunits.\n\nFigure 10.

The corresponding self Compton spectra with KN\ncross section correction are shown on the right. All of the spectra\nare in arbitrary units.\n\n3.3\n\nKlein-Nishina Corrected Spectrum\n\nAll of the spectra presented above are calculated in the\nThomson limit. For high energy photons, i.e., \u03b3h\u03bd > me c2 ,\nwhere \u03bd denotes the frequency, and \u03b3 the Lorentz factor\nof electrons, the scattering cross section does not remain\nconstant as the Thomson cross section \u03c3T . In this situation, the Klein-Nishina cross section formula should be applied instead of \u03c3T . Some Klein-Nishina corrected synchrocurvature spectrum samples with various parameters are\npresented in Figures 10 and 11.\nFrom Figures 10 and 11 it is clearly seen that due to\nthe high energy suppression of the Klein-Nishina scattering\ncross section, the high energy turnoff of SCSC radiation in\nthe Thomson limit no longer exists. So we conclude that the\ndifference between SCSC and SSC could not be significant\nwhen the Klein-Nishina cutoff is dominated.\n\n4\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nIn this paper we present the spectrum of the SCSC radiation\nfor various parameters and situations. We here summarize\nall of the results listed above:\nFirst of all, the real radiation mechanism for relativistic\nelectrons in magnetic fields could not be the synchrotron or\n\n7\n\nFigure 11.

The corresponding KN corrected\nself Compton spectra (right) are for electron collective with p = 5.\nOther parameters are the same as in Figure 10.\n\ncurvature radiation. On the contrary, the synchro-curvature\nradiation provides a more realistic treatment. Thus a similar situation is expected for self Compton scattering. If the\nseed spectrum is synchro-curvature rather than other traditional mechanisms, the inverse-Compton spectrum could\nstill be an open question. In fact, it can be seen from the\ncontents above that the resulting spectra deviates from the\nform of simple power law, especially for electrons with a\nlarger distribution index and the drifts of electrons in magnetic fields are ignored. A curved magnetic field can significantly changes the resulting spectrum. Thus SSC alone can\nnot precisely describe the real IC spectra. Combined with\nthe synchro-curvature seed, multiple turnoffs in the whole\nspectrum could be expected.\nSecond, the resulting inverse-Compton spectrum of\nsynchro-curvature radiation can be affected by various parameters, including the strength of the magnetic field B,\nthe curvature radius of the field \u03c1, the index of the electron\nenergy distribution p, and so on. For example, a smaller\ncurvature radius \u03c1 and a smaller field strength B usually\nleads to a more significant high energy turn off. The resulting spectra from electrons with a smaller distribution index\nresembles to synchrotron self Compton radiation, while for\nelectrons with a larger index of the Lorentz factor distribution, the self-Compton spectrum of synchro-curvature radiation clearly shows a high energy turnoff in the Thomson\nregime. Besides, drifting effects of electrons due to inhomogeneous magnetic field can also change the SCSC spectra,\nwith different shapes of turnoffs. This phenomena can be\nattributed to the different relations between the characteristic frequency and the radius of electrons' motion for synchrotron and curvature radiations (the SCSC spectrum is\nsomething like the summation of the synchrotron and curvature self-Compton radiations, although not exactly), as\nwell as the polynomial items in the formulae describing the\nspectrum. So the high energy self-Compton spectra of a certain astrophysical source may also used as a possible probe\nof seed radiation mechanisms, and the spatial and temporal variations of radiation spectra can reveal the changes in\nmagnetic field.\nThird, the cooling process of electrons can change the\nelectron distribution index. As a result, the resulting scattering spectra is also changed. As noted above, the high\nenergy turnoff of SCSC radiation only becomes significant\n\n\f8\n\nBo Zhang and Zi-Gao Dai\n\nwhen the electron distribution index is large. Fast cooling\nelectrons have a relatively small low energy index, and they\ncould suffer more influences. So the high energy turnoff may\nbe not as significant as expected in real situations.\nFourth, it should be noticed that the calculations in Section 3 are all based upon the assumption of isotropically distributed electrons. We calculated the electrons with \u03b4-shape\ndistribution function as well, and the resulting spectra are\nquite similar to the ones from isotropic electrons. However,\nthe spectra might be slightly different from the sample results presented in this paper for electrons with other forms\nof spatial distribution.\nFifth, the self absorption (positive for vacuum, both\npositive and negative are possible for plasma) may occur in\nthe synchro-curvature seed spectrum. However, this absorption is only evident in the low energy part, thus nearly have\nno effect on the high energy regime. Since the SCSC radiation differs from traditional radiation mechanisms mostly in\nthe high energy band, self absorption is not a major concern\nfor the calculated SCSC radiation spectra and distinguishing\nSCSC from other mechanisms.\nSixth, since we mainly discuss the self Compton radiation for isotropically distributed electrons from GRB shock\nacceleration, the polarization in the seed spectra can be\nnearly wiped out by random electrons. So the polarization\ndegree is nearly zero in the scattering spectrum for on-axis\nobservers. This may not be the real situation, and high polarization degree may exist for off-axis observations, highly\nanisotropic electrons, or magnetic fields with a certain preferred direction. While the exact value of the degree depends\non the configuration of electrons' distribution, and careful\nsimulations may be required to calculate this.\nFinally, in the Klein-Nishina regime, the difference between SCSC and SSC radiation as well as other traditional\nforms of inverse-Compton scattering is relatively small due\nto strong high energy suppression. Although the difference\ncould not be ignored in the Thomson regime, in the KleinNishina limit it seems difficult to distinguish between the\nsynchro-curvature self Compton radiation from traditional\ninverse-Compton scattering.\nThe detection of synchro-curvature radiation as well as\nSCSC can provide vital clues of the structure of magnetic\nfield. Here we also take GRB as example. The field configuration in the jet may be randomly distributed (as noted in\nSection 3) or ordered field (e.g., see Toma et al. 2009 and\nreferences herein). One way to distinguish these two models\nis to measure the polarization in the GRB emissions. However, current instruments are not quite suitable for this task;\nno reliable polarization measurement on high energy emission has been obtained yet. However, if one can analyze the\nspectrum and find out any synchro-curvature or SCSC component, this could lead to a conclusion that random field\nmay be the real configuration; since ordered magnetic field\nhave nearly straight field lines, and thus can not produce\nsynchro-curvature radiation. On the other hand, if both of\nthe spectral signature and polarization degree can be measured in the future, the understanding on GRB magnetic\nfield will be greatly improved.\nAs noted at the beginning of Section 2, in this paper\nonly circular field lines are considered. While in real astrophysical environments, the curvature radius of magnetic\nfields usually changes from place to place, as one can ex-\n\npected. Thus these calculations only show the emission from\na certain area at a certain time, and analyzing the spectra's\nspacial behavior (for extended sources) and temporal evolution can provide some insights into the structure of the\nmagnetic fields at the source region. For example, if one can\ndetect the transition between synchro-curvature/SCSC radiation and other traditional radiation mechanisms in a single\nsource, the magnetic field distribution can be unveiled, at\nleast in some degrees.\nSimilar to the synchro-curvature seed spectrum, the\nself-Compton spectrum presented in this paper should be\nconsidered as the baseline of IC scattering calculations, and\ncan be used universally to explain the high energy observations (especially the \"abnormal\" spectral behavior, including the high energy excess), and can be applied to nearly all\nhigh energy astronomical objects, e.g., active galactic nuclei,\ngamma-ray bursts, and pulsars. For example, as noted in\nDeng et al. (2005), several GRBs observed in the CGRO era\nhave high energy turnoffs; and similar spectral features has\nalso been detected by Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope,\nwith possible high energy exponential cutoff observed in one\nburst (GRB 090926A, e.g., see Ackermann et al. 2010). The\nSCSC provides another possible explanation for these facts,\nsince SCSC spectra yield high energy turnoff, while limited\nmaximum Lorentz factor can naturally give rise to high energy cutoff. And KN effects of SCSC can provide sharp cutoff as well. Here multiband data is required in order to tell\nthe real radiation mechanism beneath. And probing the real\nmechanism through high energy observations is also possible, especially for a large energy index of electrons, although\nin the Klein-Nishina regime things can be a bit more difficult.\nOf course, the high energy turnoff in observational data\ncould be easily explained by the superimposition of several\nspectra arising from different mechanisms, so it's a complicated task to confirm the contributions from synchrocurvature radiation and its self Compton scattering, especially when the scattering occurs in the Klein-Nishina limit\nwith strong high energy suppression (thus the overall spectrum may not show multiple turnoffs). In order to solve\nthis problem, temporal data are required. If both the low\nenergy part and the high energy turnoff evolve simultaneously, SCSC radiation is a possible radiation mechanism; or\nseveral mechanisms will take the responsibility, since different mechanisms usually show different temporal behaviors.\nHowever exceptions may also exist in the latter case, since\nthe structure change of a magnetic field can also lead to\ndifferent spectra at different times.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank Bing Zhang for helpful discussions and an\nanonymous referee for valuable comments that have allowed\nus to improve the manuscript.
