Gravitational perturbations of the de Sitter spacetime are\ninvestigated using the Regge\u2013Wheeler formalism.

The solution so obtained is used\nto study the deviation from an initially radial geodesic due to the perturbation.\nThe spectral properties of the perturbed metric are also analyzed. Finally, gaugeand tetrad-invariant first-order massless perturbations of any spin are explored\nfollowing the approach of Teukolsky.

Introduction\nde Sitter spacetime is extensively investigated in the literature from different points\nof view. In fact, it is particularly relevant for inflation [1] and hence the physics of\nthe very early universe. Furthermore, there are many recent experimental evidences\nand astronomical observations which indicate that the cosmological constant in the\nuniverse is positive leading to an accelerating expansion (see, e.g., Ref. [2] and\nreferences therein). The pioneering work of Gibbons and Hawking [3] extending to\ncosmological horizons the concepts of thermodinamics and particle creation previously\nintroduced for black hole event horizons opened the way to the study of the properties\nof quantum field theory on de Sitter space, especially the temperature and entropy\n(see, e.g., Refs. [4, 5, 6, 7]), and on asymptotically de Sitter spaces containing black\nholes. In this respect, it proved useful to express the de Sitter metric in static form\n(see, e.g., Ref. [8]).\nWe are interested here in studying metric perturbations in the static region of the\nde Sitter spacetime between the origin and the cosmological horizon. We will then use\nthe Regge\u2013Wheeler [9] formalism to decompose the perturbations in tensor harmonics\nand Fourier transform it with respect to time, as customary. We will account for\nperturbations of both parity, and investigate the features of geodesic motion in the\nperturbed gravitational field. In particular, we will consider an initially radial geodesic\n\n\fde Sitter spacetime: effects of metric perturbations on geodesics\n\n2\n\nin the unperturbed spacetime and study how the motion deviates from maintaining\npurely radial as a result of the perturbation. Furthermore, we will also consider\ngauge- and tetrad-invariant first-order massless perturbations of any spin following the\napproach of Teukolsky [10], and discuss the existence of closed-form, i.e. Liouvillian,\nsolutions to the radial equation. Note that our results are consistent with those of Refs.\n[11] and [12] concerning the perturbations of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime,\nwhich however focused on the stability of the de Sitter spacetime in the presence of\nthe black hole and on the scattering properties of both the event and cosmological\nhorizons.\nSection 2 summarizes what is known about radial geodesics in de Sitter spacetime,\nwhile metric perturbations for both electric and magnetic multipoles are discussed in\nsection 3. The equations for perturbations to radial geodesics are integrated in section\n4, while section 5 contains the derivation of Liouvillian solutions to the radial part\nof the Teukolsky master equation for massless perturbations of any spin. Concluding\nremarks are presented in section 6, while relevant details are given in the appendices.\n2.

[16], where the perturbation equations for fields of different spin\nhave been solved by using the technique of Debye potentials), we are are interested\nhere in investigating the existence of closed-form, i.e. Liouvillian, solutions to the\nperturbation equations.\nThe Teukolsky master equation, in this case, reads as\n\u001a\n1\nN2\n1\n1\n0=\n\u2202tt \u2212\n\u2202rr \u2212 2 \u2202\u03b8\u03b8 \u2212 2 2 \u2202\u03c6\u03c6\n2\n2N\n2\n2r\n2r sin \u03b8\ns\n(s + 1)(1 \u2212 2N 2 )\ncot \u03b8\n+\n\u2202t +\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202r \u2212\n2\nrN\nr\u0014\n2r2\n\u0015\u001b\n1\ns2\nis cos \u03b8\n2\n\u03c8.\n(5.1)\n\u2212 2 2 \u2202\u03c6 + 2 (1 + s)[3s + 2 \u2212 2N (2s + 1)] +\n2r\nr sin \u03b8\nsin2 \u03b8\n\n\fde Sitter spacetime: effects of metric perturbations on geodesics\n\n(a)\n\n12\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 5.

We are interested here in investigating the existence\nof closed-form, i.e. Liouvillian, solutions to the radial equation (5.5) governing the\nperturbations. Roughly speaking, the set of Liouvillian functions includes the usual\nelementary functions such as exponential, trigonometric, logarithmic functions, etc.,\nbut not generic hypergeometric functions or other special functions.

Concluding remarks\nThe present work has been motivated by a previous study on gravitational waves\nabout de Sitter backgrounds [18], which is relevant for the stochastic background\nemerging from inflation, and by the analysis in [19] of gravitational waves and their\ngeodesics. We have solved the gravitational perturbation problem in the static region\nof the de Sitter spacetime between the origin and the cosmological horizon by using\nthe Regge\u2013Wheeler formalism. The set of perturbation equations has been reduced\nto a single second order differential equation of the Heun-type for both electric and\nmagnetic multipoles. We have then investigated the geodesic motion in the perturbed\ngravitational field. In particular, an initially radial geodesic in the unperturbed\nspacetime cannot remain radial as a result of the perturbation. The deviation from\nradial motion has been shown to occur in both polar and azimuthal directions. Finally,\nwe have investigated gauge- and tetrad-invariant first-order massless perturbations of\nany spin following the approach of Teukolsky. The general solution to the radial part\nof the Teukolsky equation can be expressed in terms of Heun functions. However, we\nhave shown that there also exists in addition a class of closed-form, i.e. Liouvillian,\nsolutions.\n\n\fde Sitter spacetime: effects of metric perturbations on geodesics\n\n16\n\nAppendix A.

Magnetic multipoles\nThe same procedure outlined above for the case of electric multipoles can be followed\nhere to reduce the coupled system (3.22)\u2013(3.23) to a second-order differential equation\nfor h1 of the Heun type. First, eliminate h\u03030 in favour of h1 , then introduce the new\nvariable z = x2 and a rescaling h1 (z) = f (z)y(z) of the form (C.4).

The Kovacic algorithm: an overview\nThe Kovacic algorithm applies to a second-order ordinary differential equation of\nnormal form\nd2 y\n= W (r)y,\n(D.1)\ndr2\nwhen W (r) is a given element of C(r), the field of rational functions with coefficients\nin the field of complex numbers. Kovacic proved that all Liouvillian solutions to\nEq. (D.1) belong to three mutually exclusive types. Furthermore, for each type, he\nprovided an algorithm which determines whether a Liouvillian solution exists for that\ntype, and constructs the solution in case it does exist. The types are as follows:\nType 1. The differential equation has a solution of the form e\n\nR\nR\n\n\u03a9\u0303dr\n\n, where \u03a9\u0303 \u2208 C(r).\n\n\u03a9\u0303dr ,\n\nType 2. The differential equation has a solution of the form e\nwhere \u03a9\u0303 is algebraic\nover C(r) of degree 2 (i.e., \u03a9\u0303 is a solution of a polynomial equation of degree 2\nwith coefficients in C(r)), and solutions of type 1 form an empty set.\nType 3. All solutions of the differential equation are algebraic over C(r) of degree 2, and\nsolutions of type 1 and 2 form two empty sets.\nIf none of the previous cases applies, the differential equation has no Liouvillian\nsolution. The construction of each type of Liouvillian solution is derived from the\npole structure of the rational function. Kovacic also discussed some conditions that\nare necessary for cases 1, 2 or 3 to hold. For type 1 every pole of W (r) should have\neven order or else order 1, and the pole at \u221e should have either even order or order\n\n\fde Sitter spacetime: effects of metric perturbations on geodesics\n\n19\n\ngreater than 2. For type 2 a necessary condition is that W (r) must have at least one\npole that has either odd order greater than 2 or order 2. Last, for type 3 the order of\na pole of W (r) cannot exceed 2, and the order of the pole at \u221e must be at least 2.\nLet us discuss in detail the case 1. The remaining cases 2 and 3 apply as well and\ncan be treated similarly.\nFor a fixed rational function W (r), type 1 Liouvillian solutions of Eq. (D.1) are\ndetermined in the following way. A finite set of constants d is derived algorithmically\nfrom the pole structure of W (r) and for each d a function \u03a9\u0303(r) is also constructed.\nIf any d is a non-negative integer n and, for the corresponding \u03a9\u0303(r), the differential\nequation\n\"\n#\nd2 P(r)\ndP(r)\nd\u03a9\u0303\n2\n+ 2\u03a9\u0303\n+\n+ \u03a9\u0303 \u2212 W (r) P(r) = 0\n(D.2)\ndr2\ndr\ndr\nhas a polynomial solution P of degree n, then Eq. (D.1) has a Liouvillian solution\ngiven by\ny = Pe\n\nR\n\n\u03a9\u0303dr\n\n.\n\n(D.3)\n\nIf this is not the case for any d, then Eq. (D.1) has no type 1 solutions.\nSince W (r) depends on different independent parameters, several different pole\nstructures may occur by imposing conditions on the parameters which alter the order\nof poles. For each different pole structure, in general, d and \u03a9\u0303 are expressed in terms\nof the parameters. Solutions to Eq. (D.1) may be obtained by requiring d = n, which\nthen is just a constraint on the parameters, and finding all sets of parameters for which\nEq. (D.2) has a polynomial solution of degree n.\nAcknowledgement\nICRANet is thanked for support and Dr. V. Montaquila for stimulating discussion.\nGE is grateful to Dipartimento di Scienze Fisiche of Federico II University, Naples,\nfor hospitality and support, and he dedicates to Maria Gabriella his contribution to\nthis work.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n\nGuth A H 1981 Phys.
