(b) Evolutionary scheme of radio-loud AGNs.\n\n1. Introduction\nRadio sources are divided into two distinct morphological groups of objects: FR Is and FR IIs\n(Fanaroff &Riley, 1974). There is a relatively sharp luminosity boundary between them at low\nfrequency. The nature of the FR-division is still an open issue, as are the details of the evolutionary process in which younger and smaller Gigahertz-Peaked Spectrum (GPS) and Compact Steep\nSpectrum (CSS) sources become large scale radio structures. The GPS and CSS sources form a\nwell-defined class of compact radio objects and are considered to be entirely contained within the\nhost galaxy. During their evolution the radio jets start to cross the ISM and try to leave the host\ngalaxy. The interaction with the ISM can be very strong in GPS/CSS sources and it seems to be a\ncrucial point in the evolution of radio sources.\nIn this paper we present a short summary of the obtained results of the radio observations of\n44 low luminosity compact (LLC) sources and analysis of their optical properties. The details of\nthe selection criteria and process are given in Kunert-Bajraszewska et al.(2010a), as are the detailed\nresults of the study of their radio properties. The details of the optical analysis of the LLC sources\nare given in Kunert-Bajraszewska et al.(2010b). The radio observations of the whole sample were\nmade with MERLIN at L-band and C-band. Optical data are available for 29 LLC sources and have\nbeen obtained from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)/DR7.\n\n2. Results of radio observations\nAbout 70% of the observed LLC sources are galaxies and all of them are nearby objects with\nredshifts in the range 0.04<z<0.9. Most of them have been resolved and about 30% of them have\nweak extended emission and disturbed structures when compared with the observations of higher\nluminosity CSS sources.We suggest that some of the sources with the breaking up structures or onesided morphology are candidates for compact faders. We studied correlation between radio power\nand linear size, and redshift with a larger sample that included also published samples of compact\n2\n\n\fEmission line - radio correlation for LLC sources\n\nM.

The Luminosity-Size\ndiagram (Fig.1a) shows an evolutionary scheme of radio-loud AGNs.The selection criteria used\nfor the new sample resulted in approximately one third of the LLC sources having a value of the\n1.4 GHz radio luminosity comparable to FR Is. Their luminosities are definitely lower than CSS\nsources from last existing samples (Fanti et al.2001 and Marecki et al.2003). We conclude that\nmany of them can be short-lived objects, at least in the current phase of evolution and undergo\ndisrupted evolution many times as they will be able to get out of the host galaxy and evolve to\nFR IIs (two-sided arrows in Fig.1b). The observed parameters of LLC sources (radio luminosity\nand size), their radio morphology and spectroscopic features indicate that most of them will evolve\nfinally to FR II. However, we suggest that there exists a much larger population of short-lived low\nluminosity compact objects unexplored so far and among them we can find precursors of large\nscale FR Is. The proposed evolutionary scheme is drawn in Fig.1b.\n\n3. Results of optical analysis\nOptical data are available for most of the LLC sources and based on them we have classified\nthe sources as high and low excitation galaxies (HEG and LEG, respectively). We have compared\nthe [O III] luminosity with the radio properties for LLC sources, and expanded the sample with\nother CSS, GPS sources and FR I and FR II objects (Kunert-Bajraszewska et al., 2010b). The\nwhole sample shows that, for a given size or radio luminosity, HEG sources are brighter than LEG\nin the [O III] line by a factor of 10 (Fig.2b). The LLC objects follow the same correlation between\n[O III] luminosity and radio power, as the rest of the sample, although the LLC objects have lower\nvalues of [O III] luminosity than the more powerful CSS sources (Fig.2a). Based on the analysis\nabove, we propose a scenario where the differences in the nature of LEG and HEG (accretion\n3\n\n\fEmission line - radio correlation for LLC sources\n\nM. Kunert-Bajraszewska\n\nmode or black hole spin) are already visible in the CSS phase of AGN evolution and determine\nthe evolution of the source: i.e. CSSLEG evolve to FRLEG , CSSHEG evolve to FRHEG. The main\nevolution scenario (GPS-CSS-FR II) for radio-loud AGNs was proposed years ago. However, once\nthe HEG/LEG division is included, these sources seem to evolve in parallel: GPSLEG-CSSLEGFRLEG and GPSHEG -CSSHEG-FRHEG . Concerning LEG, it is still not clear if CSSLEG would evolve\ndirectly to FR ILEG or go through a FR IILEG phase before the FR ILEG. As discussed in KunertBajraszewska et al., 2010a, there should also exist a group of short-lived CSS objects with lower\nradio luminosities. These short-lived CSSs could probably show the low [O III] luminosities seen\nin FR Is.\nAcknowledgement\nMERLIN is a UK National Facility operated by the University of Manchester on behalf of STFC.\nThis work makes use of EURO-VO software, tools or services.
