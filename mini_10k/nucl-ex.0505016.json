[2]. Twoproton radioactivity was sought for many years without success. This research field experienced a strong\nboost with the advent of high-intensity projectilefragmentation facilities. At these facilities, experimentalists could for the first time reach the most promising\ncandidates for two-proton radioactivity. According to recent theoretical predictions, proton drip-line nuclei in the\nA=40-55 region were identified as the most promising\ncandidates [3\u20135]. The recent observation of two-proton\nradioactivity of 45 Fe [6,7] confirmed these predictions\nnicely. In other experiments, less promising candidates\nlike 42 Cr, and 49 Ni could be shown to decay by \u03b2-delayed\nprocesses [8]. Beyond 45 Fe, 48 Ni and 54 Zn were regarded\nas possible candidates to exhibit two-proton radioactivity. In the present letter, we report on the first observation of 54 Zn and its decay by two-proton radioactivity.\n54\nZn was produced by quasi-fragmentation reactions of a primary 58 Ni26+ beam, accelerated to\n74.5 MeV/nucleon by the GANIL cyclotrons, which impinged with an average intensity of 4\u03bcA on a nat Ni target of thickness 250mg/cm2 installed in the SISSI device.\nThe fragments were selected by the ALPHA-LISE3 separator which included a 50\u03bcm thick beryllium degrader in\nthe intermediate focal plane of LISE. Two micro-channel\nplate (MCP) detectors at the first LISE focal plane and\na detection set-up consisting of four silicon detectors installed at the end of the LISE3 beam line allowed us to\nidentify the fragments on an event-by-event basis and to\nstudy their decay properties.\nThe first silicon detector had a thickness of 300\u03bcm\nand served to measure the energy loss (\u2206E) of the fragments and their time-of-flight (TOF) with respect to the\ntwo MCP detectors and the radiofrequency (RF) of the\ncyclotrons. The second silicon detector, 300 \u03bcm thick,\nyielded a second energy-loss signal, a TOF measurement\nwith respect to the cyclotron RF, and served to detect\n\u03b2 particles from the radioactive decays in the adjacent\ndouble-sided silicon-strip detector (DSSSD). The DSSSD\n\nThe nucleus 54 Zn has been observed for the first time in\nan experiment at the SISSI/LISE3 facility of GANIL in the\nquasi-fragmentation of a 58 Ni beam at 74.5 MeV/nucleon in\na nat Ni target. The fragments were analysed by means of the\nALPHA-LISE3 separator and implanted in a silicon-strip detector where correlations in space and time between implantation and subsequent decay events allowed us to generate\nalmost background free decay spectra for about 25 different\nnuclei at the same time. Eight 54 Zn implantation events were\nobserved. From the correlated decay events, the half-life of\n54\nZn is determined to be 3.2+1.8\n\u22120.8 ms. Seven of the eight implantations are followed by two-proton emission with a decay\nenergy of 1.48(2) MeV. The decay energy and the partial halflife are compared to model predictions and allow for a test of\nthese two-proton decay models.\nPACS numbers: 23.50.+z, 23.90.+w, 21.10.-k, 27.40.+z\n\nOur understanding of nuclear structure is mainly based\non results obtained with nuclei close to the line of stability. These studies allowed for understanding of the\nbasic structure of the strong interaction which governs\nthe interplay between neutrons and protons in an atomic\nnucleus. However, these nuclei close to stability cover\nonly a very small range in isospin, i.e. their proton-toneutron ratio is rather similar. With the advent of machines to produce radioactive nuclei, these basic concepts\ncan now be tested with more and more exotic nuclei having a strong imbalance of neutrons and protons.\nWith these exotic nuclei being much further away from\nstability, also new phenomena appeared. For nuclei beyond the proton drip line, where the strong force can\nno longer bind all protons, one- and two-proton (2p)\nradioactivity was predicted more than 40 years ago by\nGoldanskii [1]. For odd-Z nuclei, one-proton radioactivity was proposed to occur, whereas for medium- and\nheavy-mass even-Z nuclei the nuclear pairing energy renders one-proton emission impossible. In this case, twoproton emission is to be expected.\nOne-proton radioactivity was observed for the first\n1\n\n\fThis procedure yields basically background free identification spectra. Thus, eight events have been attributed\nto 54 Zn. This represents the first identification of this\nisotope. It is the most proton-rich zinc nucleus ever observed and is predicted to be particle unstable with respect to two-proton emission by all modern mass predictions. However, the Q2p value varies widely (see below).\n54\nZn has been produced by a two-proton pick-up reaction. From a production rate of about two nuclei per\nday, we estimate a production cross section of about \u03c3 =\n100 fb.\nAs mentioned above, 54 Zn is predicted to be twoproton unbound. Figure 2 shows the decay energy spectrum measured for the first decay event in the same x-y\npixel after a 54 Zn implantation. For eight implantations,\nwe observe seven decay events with a decay energy of\n1.48(2) MeV. None of these seven events has a coincident\nsignal in the adjacent detectors, whereas the \u03b2-particle\nsignals can be observed for neighboring nuclei which disintegrate by \u03b2 decay. The energy calibration was performed with well-known neighboring \u03b2-delayed proton\nemitters and \u03b1 sources. Both procedures need corrections: the \u03b2-delayed proton emitter calibration needs to\nbe corrected for the \u03b2 energy summing which was done\nwith Monte Carlo simulations, whereas the \u03b1-particle calibration has to be corrected for the dead layer of the silicon detector. Both procedures yielded consistent results.\nThis calibration yields the total decay energy, which includes the recoil of the daughter nucleus. It assumes that\nthe pulse height defect is negligible. The total error of\nthe decay energy is a result of the error of the energy\ncalibration and the statistical error of the peak centroid.\n\nhad a thickness of 500 \u03bcm and 16 strips (3 mm-wide) on\neach side. It was used to measure the residual energy\nof the fragments and their decay characteristics. Finally,\nthe fourth element was a 5 mm thick lithium-drifted silicon detector which served to detect \u03b2 particles from radioactive decays in the DSSSD. These detectors yielded\neight fragment identification parameters (two \u2206E signals, two residual energies from both sides of the DSSSD,\nand four TOF measurements) which were used to unambigously identify the different fragments and reject basically any background.\nThe experimental data were stored on tape on an\nevent-by-event basis. To minimise the data acquisition dead time, we used two independent CAMAC/VXI\nbranches. The trigger to start the event treatment\nswitched from one system to the other after each event.\nBoth branches were read-out via one VME branch. In\norder to avoid double triggering, we increased the trigger signal width to 20\u03bcs. This data acquisition system\nallowed us to treat two subsequent events as long as they\nare more than 20\u03bcs apart. The event treatment lasted\nabout 300\u03bcs for each of the two branches, which means\nthat we lost one event in the case where three events\narrived within 300\u03bcs. However, these events still incremented a scaler which was read out event-by-event.\nTherefore, only events which followed a preceding event\nwithin less than 20\u03bcs got completely lost.\n850\n\n54\n\nZn\n\n750\n52\n\nNi\n\n700\n51\n\n650\n\nCounts\n\nEnergy loss (MeV)\n\n800\n\nNi\n\n3\n\n2500\n\n52\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n600\n\nNi\n4000\n\n2\n54\n\n550\n\n500\n1280\n\nZn\n\n1290\n\n1300\n\n1310\n\n1320\n\n1330\n\n1340\n\n1350\n\n1360\n\n1370\n\n1\n\n1380\n\nTime of flight (ns)\n0\n\nFIG. 1.

This nucleus decays by \u03b2-delayed proton emission\nwith proton energies of 1.06 MeV and 1.34 MeV and\nbranching ratios of 4% and 10%, respectively [9]. We\nobserve indeed two second decay events with energies in\nagreement with these expectations. However, 52 Ni decays by \u03b2-delayed \u03b3 emission with a branching ratio of\n70%. In these cases, we have a probability of only about\n15% to detect the \u03b2 particle in the DSSSD and therefore\nto be able to correlate it properly with the 54 Zn implantation.\nThe experimental information collected above can only\nbe explained consistently by the assumption of a decay by\ntwo-proton radioactivity of 54 Zn with a branching ratio\nof 87+10\n\u221217 %. All other possible decay modes do not yield\na consistent picture. For \u03b2-delayed decays, we would expect to observe for a few decays the \u03b2 particle as well as\na broadening of the peak. For \u03b1 radioactivity, the barrier\npenetration half-life for an \u03b1 particle with an energy of\n1.48 MeV is several minutes, while the same barrier penetration lasts only about 10\u221217 s in the case of one-proton\nemission with a decay energy of 1.48 MeV. We therefore\nconclude on the observation of ground-state two-proton\nradioactivity for 54 Zn. In the following paragraphs, we\n2p\nwill compare the experimental partial half-life of T1/2\n=\n+2.2\n3.7\u22121.0 ms and the 2p decay energy of E2p = 1.48(2) MeV\nto different model predictions.\nStarting from the 2p decay energy, we can determine\nthe mass excess of 54 Zn. Using the mass excess of 52 Ni\nas determined by means of the isobaric multiplet mass\nequation of \u2206m = -22.64(4) MeV [9], we obtain a mass\nexcess of \u2206m = -6.58(4) MeV for 54 Zn. This mass excess\ncompares well with e.g. the mass prediction of -6.34 MeV\nfrom J\u00e4necke and Masson [10] and the mass extrapolation\nof -6.57(40) MeV from Audi and co-workers [11].\nThe decay energy E2p was recently predicted by several authors. Brown et al. [3] proposed an energy of\n1.33(14) MeV. Ormand [4] determined an energy of\n1.97(24) MeV, whereas Cole [5] predicted a value of\n1.79(12) MeV. All these theoretical decay energies are\nreasonably close to our experimental datum. However, when used in a simple barrier-penetration di-proton\nmodel, which is expected to yield only a lower limit for\nthe partial half-life for 2p decay [12], we obtain values\nbetween 20 ms and 10\u22127 ms, a rather large spread.\nSuch a di-proton model completely neglects any nuclear structure or any dynamics of the decay. Grigorenko\nand co-workers [12,13] developed a model which explicitly\nincludes the decay dynamics by modelling the protonproton and proton-core interaction in the decay. Their\nthree-body model result is compared to our experimental\nresult in figure 4. We obtain reasonable agreement between experiment and theory, if we assume that the two\nprotons are emitted from a p orbital, as expected from\nsimple shell-model arguments. The three-body model\nyields much longer half-lives for a given decay energy\nthan the simple di-proton model.\n\nCounts\n\nof 40(5)% for the Si(Li) detector and of 20(10)% for the\ndetector in front of the DSSSD. With these numbers, we\ndetermine a probability to miss all \u03b2 particles, if 54 Zn\nwould decay by a \u03b2-delayed mode with a 100% branching ratio, of 0.16+0.21\n\u22120.15 %. Another indication that there is\nno \u03b2-particle emission comes from the fact that the full\nwidth at half maximum of the 54 Zn peak in figure 2 is almost a factor of two narrower than e.g. the 1.3 MeV peak\nfrom \u03b2-delayed proton emission of 52 Ni. This broadening\nfor 52 Ni comes from the energy loss of the \u03b2 particles in\nthe DSSSD.\nOne decay event has an energy signal of 4.19 MeV. This\nevent is in coincidence with a signal in the last detector\nidentifying it as a \u03b2-delayed decay. We investigated the\npossibility that we missed the first decay event due to\nthe data acquisition dead time. However, from the scaler\ncontent we found no evidence for such a loss. All events\nbetween the 54 Zn implantation and the subsequent decay events (54 Zn and daughter decays) registered by the\nscalers are also on tape with the complete event information. This means that the only possibility to lose the\nfirst decay event for the eighth 54 Zn is that this decay\nhappened within 20\u03bcs of a preceding event. As the first\nobserved decay event for this 54 Zn implantation happens\nonly 1.9 ms after the implantation event which has to be\ncompared to the half-life of 54 Zn (see below), we believe\nthat it is highly likely that the 4.19 MeV event is indeed\nthe first decay event.\nFrom these findings, we conclude that the branching\nratio for 2p emission of 54 Zn is BR = 87+10\n\u221217 %. We will\nuse this branching ratio to determine the partial half-life\nfor 2p decay of 54 Zn which will be compared to model\npredictions below.\n\n4\n54\n\n3\n\n2\n\nZn\n\nT1/2 = 3.2+- 1.8\n0.8 ms\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nTime (ms)\n\nFIG. 3. The half-life of 54 Zn is determined by means of the\ndecay-time distribution of the first decay events after 54 Zn\nimplantation. The half-life determined is given in the figure.\n\nIn figure 3, we present the decay time distribution for\nthe eight decay events. We determine a half-life value\nof 3.2+1.8\n\u22120.8 ms. Together with the branching ratio for 2p\nemission determined above, we get a partial half-life for\n2p\n2p emission of 54 Zn of T1/2\n= 3.7+2.2\n\u22121.0 ms.\nAnother indication for the occurrence of 2p radioac3\n\n\ffor this enhancement. In reference [19], an enhancement\nfactor of about two (the ratio of the \u01eb factors in columns\n3 and 5 of Table 3 of this paper) due to mixing with the\nsd and g9/2 orbitals was calculated for the two-neutron\ntransfer in the (p, t) reaction in the pf shell. Calculations\nof the two-proton decay that include orbitals outside the\npf shell remain to be carried out.\nIn summary, we observed for the first time the new isotope 54 Zn. As predicted by modern mass models, it decays by two-proton emission with a decay energy of E2p =\n1.48(2) MeV. The two-proton branching ratio is 87+10\n\u221217 %\nand the total half-life was determined to be 3.2+1.8\n\u22120.8 ms\n2p\n+2.2\nyielding a 2p partial half-life of T1/2 = 3.7\u22121.0 ms. The\ntwo advanced models able to describe two-proton radioactivity achieve reasonable agreement with our experimental data. Future studies will try to find more cases\nof two-proton radioactivity and investigate the decay in\nmore detail by measuring the p-p angular correlation and\nthe energy of the individual protons.\nWe would like to acknowledge the continous effort of\nthe whole GANIL staff for ensuring a smooth running\nof the experiment.

Relation between half-life / decay width and decay\nenergy as determined by the three-body model of Grigorenko\net al. [13]. The picture compares the experimental datum to\nthe three-body model (solid lines) with two different assumptions for the proton emitting orbital and with the di-proton\nmodel (dashed lines) for two different channel radii.\n\nThe three-body model contains only little nuclear\nstructure information, but treats the dynamics in a reasonable fashion. Brown and Barker developed the Rmatrix approach to apply it for 2p emission [14,15]. This\nmodel includes the s-wave proton-proton interaction as\nan intermediate state. The nuclear structure input is the\n\u0010\n\u0011\u03bb\nA\nspectroscopic factor [16] S = A\u22122\nG2 (pf ) C(A, Z)\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\nwhere G2 = 5/16, \u03bb=6, A is the mass of the parent nucleus (A = 54), and C(A, Z) = |< \u03a8(A \u2212 2, Z \u2212 2) |\n\u03c8c | \u03a8(A, Z) >|2 is the cluster overlap for the di-proton\ncluster wavefunction \u03c8c in the pf shell with L = 0, S = 0\nand T = 1 in the SU3 basis. The pf -shell wavefunctions\n\u03a8 were obtained with the recent GPFX1 interaction [17]\nwith the result C = 0.39. For the di-proton - nucleus\npotential, we take a Woods-Saxon form plus a uniformsphere Coulomb potential with radius RC = rC A1/3 .\nThe Woods-Saxon parameters are R = r0 A1/3 for the\nradius, a0 for the diffuseness, and a well depth adjusted to reproduce the resonance energy. The potential parameters are taken from an analysis of low-energy\ndeuteron scattering [18]: r0 = 1.17 fm, a0 = 0.72 fm,\nrC = 1.30 fm. These are the same potential parameters\nused for the calculation of the di-proton decay for 45 Fe\nin reference [15].\nWith the experimental Q value of 1.48(2) MeV, the re+5\nsulting half-life is 16+10\n\u22126 ms, whereas the value is 9\u22123 ns\nwhen the p \u2212 p resonance is ignored. The experimental\ndecay rate is 2-10 times faster than the theoretical value\nwhich takes into account the p \u2212 p resonance. A similar enhancement was found in the comparison of experiment and theory for 45 Fe [15]. Pairing correlations due\nto configuration mixing beyond the pf shell may account\n\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n\n4\n\nV. I. Goldanskii, Nucl.
