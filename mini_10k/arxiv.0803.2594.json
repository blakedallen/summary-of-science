We have recently approached this problem via M\u00f8ller-Plesset (MP) perturbation theory [1, 2].\nBy adopting L\u00f6wdin's [3] definition of the ground-state\ncorrelation energy as the difference between the exact\nand the Hartree-Fock (HF) values, here we shall propose\ntwo, formally exact, routes to the correlation energy density. The first of these, as in [2], starts out from the\nso-called level-shift formula [4], but in contrast to [2],\nwhere low-order perturbation theory is invoked, our central example is exactly solvable, which means that the\nMP series has been summed to all orders. This example\nis the model two-electron atom introduced by Moshinsky\n[5] and it is therefore natural enough that we pose the\ntwo-electron atom example formally exactly in section II\nimmediately below. Section III presents the exact theory\nfor the Moshinsky model. Comparison is made in section IV of the total kinetic energy, including correlation\nof the Moshinsky atom with that of the (non-relativistic)\nHe-like series of atomic ions for large atomic number.\nAn alternative route for defining the correlation energy\ndensity is then proposed in section V, which may prove\n\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor. E-mail: giuseppe.angilella@ct.infn.it\n\nto come into its own in solid-state theory rather than\nmolecular physics. Section VI constitutes a summary,\nplus proposals for future studies which should be fruitful.\nII. EXACT LEVEL-SHIFT THEORY FOR THE\nGROUND STATE OF ATOMS AND MOLECULES\n\nLet us consider an N -body system described by the\nHamiltonian\nH = H 0 + HI ,\n(1a)\nZ\nH0 =\ndr1 dr2 \u03a8\u2020 (r1 )h(r1 , r2 )\u03a8(r),\n(1b)\nZ\n1\nHI =\ndr1 dr2 \u03a8\u2020 (r1 )\u03a8\u2020 (r2 )v(r1 , r2 )\u03a8(r2 )\u03a8(r1(1c)\n),\n2\nwhere the field operators in second quantization are defined as usual by their expressions in terms of the creation\nand annihilation operators and their standard commutation relations:\nX\n\u03a8(r) =\n\u03a8k (r) ak ,\n(2a)\nk\n\n\u2020\n\n\u03a8 (r) =\n\nX\n\n\u03a8\u2217k (r) a\u2020k ,\n\n(2b)\n\nk\n\n[ak , a\u2020k\u2032 ]+ = \u03b4kk\u2032 ,\n\n[ak , ak\u2032 ]+ = 0.\n\n(2c)\n\nHere, v(r1 , r2 ) is the interaction potential between the\nparticles and h(r1 , r2 ) is the kernel of a one particle operator that reduces to the kinetic energy operator in the\n\n\f2\nusual cases. However, it may also embody the effect of\nan external potential and other effects. The creation (annihilation) operator a\u2020k (ak ) is assumed to create (annihilate) particles in states described by the wave-functions\n\u03a8k (r). Here, as is usual, r \u2261 (x, s), with x denoting the\nparticle position, and s the particle spin, and k is the collective quantum number associated with the basis states\n{\u03a8k }. We will assume that the free Hamiltonian is diagonal in the spin variable and also that the interaction is\nspin-independent, i.e.\nh(r1 , r2 ) = h(x1 , x2 )\u03b4s1 ss\nv(r1 , r2 ) = v(x1 , x2 ).\n\n(3a)\n(3b)\n\nFollowing [2], let us use the level-shift formula [4], taking as the unperturbed problem the Fock Hamiltonian\nHHF , with ground state energy E0 . Then, for two electrons, we can write explicitly for the correlation energy\ndensity \u01ebc (r1 )\n\u01ebc (r1 ) =\n\nR\n\n\u03a8\u2217 (r1 , r2 )[H \u2212 HHF ]\u03a6HF (r1 , r2 )dr2\nR\n,\n\u03a8\u2217 (r1 , r2 )\u03a6HF (r1 , r2 )dr1 dr2\n\nh\u03a8|\u03a6HF i\u01ebc (r1 ) = E\n\n\u2212 E0\n\nZ\n\nThe Moshinsky model atom has confining (external)\npotential 12 (|r1 |2 + |r2 |2 ) and particle interaction also of\nharmonic form 21 k|r1 \u2212r2 |2 . Using coordinates R = (r1 +\n\u221a\n\u221a\nr2 )/ 2 and r = (r1 \u2212 r2 )/ 2, the exact ground-state\nwavefunction takes the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\n1 2\n1\n1\n(1 + 2k) 8\n2 r2\nexp\n\u2212\n.\nexp\n\u2212\nR\n(1\n+\n2k)\n\u03a8(r, R) =\n3\n2\n2\n\u03c02\n(6)\nLess well known is the fact that the corresponding \u03a6HF\nwavefunction entering the key expression (5) for the correlation energy density has the exact form [6]\n\u03a6HF (r1 , r2 ) = \u03c6(r1 )\u03c6(r2 ),\n\n3\n\n(1 + k) 8\n3\n\n\u03c04\n\n(4)\n\n\u03a8\u2217 (r1 , r2 )\u03a6HF (r1 , r2 )dr2\n\u03a8\u2217 (r1 , r2 )\u03a6HF (r1 , r2 )dr2 , (5)\n\nwhere in reaching Eq. (5) from Eq. (4), H has been allowed to act on \u03a8\u2217 , and HHF on \u03a6HF . Of course, by\nintegrating both sides of Eq. (5) over all r1 , we obtain a\ntrivial identity for E \u2212 E0 , the latter quantity Rbeing simply the total L\u00f6wdin correlation energy Ec = \u01ebc (r)dr.\nWhile Eq. (5) is of course, valid for the (nonrelativistic) He-like series of two-electron ions with atomic number Z, we do not presently know \u03a8\u2217 and E analytically.\nTherefore in section III immediately below, we turn to illustrate Eq. (5) analytically by appeal to the Moshinsky\ntwo-electron atom model [5].\n\n(7)\n\nwhere\n\u03c6(r) =\n\nwhere \u03a8 is the exact ground-state wave function. It\nshould be noted that the definition above of the correlation energy density, Eq. (4), is not unique. However,\nthis circumstance is not necessarily problematic, because\nany alternative definition should lead to the same total integrated correlation energy. This is a similar situation, and moreover also seems to be close connected,\nwith the known lack of precise definitions of the energymomentum tensor for general physical systems. Therefore, such a property should not restrict the value and\nutility of the concept, whenever it becomes possible to\nconstruct a theoretical scheme in which this energy density plays a relevant role independently of its non-unique\ndefinition. From Eq. (4) we then have, in an obvious\nnotation\nZ\n\nIII.

(7) only provides the spatial dependence of the ground state, whose overall antisymmetric character is to be provided by the spin dependence.\nSince the spin structure of the ground state problem is\nfixed by its singlet character, we can safely employ the\nsymbol r below to denote only the spatial coordinates.\nPlots of the \"overlap\" h\u03a8|\u03a6HF i are already available\nas functions of the particle-particle interaction strength\nk: e.g. for k = 1 the overlap is 0.94. Inserting Eqs. (6)\nand (7) into the right-hand-side of Eq. (5) we obtain an\nexact result for \u01ebc (r), now spherically symmetric in the\nMoshinsky atom model. The correlation energy density,\nthe HF, and exact electron densities, respectively, have\nall the analytic form\n\u01ebc (r) = Ec\n\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u0011 23\n\u03c0\n\nexp(\u2212\u03b1r2 ), \u03b1 =\n\n\u0012 \u0013 32\n\u03b2\nexp(\u2212\u03b2r2 ),\n\u03c1(r) = 2\n\u03c0\n\u0010 \u03b3 \u0011 32\nexp(\u2212\u03b3r2 ),\n\u03c1HF (r) = 2\n\u03c0\n\u221a\na = 1 + 2k,\n\nb2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 a)2\n,\n4b\n(9a)\n\n2a\n,\n1+a\n\u221a\n\u03b3 = 1 + k,\n\n\u03b2=\n\n(9b)\n(9c)\n\nb = 1 + a + 2\u03b3.

Figure 2 shows the reduced correlation\nenergy density \u01ebc (r)/Ec (full line) together with the HF\n(long dashes) and exact (short dashes) densities normalized to one, for k = 1.

DENSITY DEPENDENCE OF THE TOTAL\nKINETIC ENERGIES IN THE MOSHINSKY\nMODEL ATOM AND THE He-LIKE ATOMIC\nIONS AT LARGE ATOMIC NUMBER Z\n\nLet us illustrate in this section two examples of physical systems in which the total kinetic energy can be expressed as a functional of the density. We note first that\nthe total kinetic energy of the Moshinsky model treated\nin section III above can be expressed exactly in terms\nsolely of \u03c1(r). From [7] one knows that the kinetic energy density t now defined from the wavefunction form\n\nKinetic energy, including correlation, of the He-like\natomic ions with large atomic number\n\nFollowing the work of Schwartz [8] on the He-like\natomic ions with large Z (however, still non-relativistic)\nthe total kinetic energy T has been obtained by Gal,\nMarch and Nagy [9] as\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u00152 Z\nZ\n1 \u03c1\u2032 (r)\n1 \u03c1\u2032 (r)\n\u03c1(r)\nT =\u2212\ndr\u2212\n\u03c1(r)dr.\n2 \u03c1(r) r=0\n|r|\n8 \u03c1(r) r=0\n(14)\nThis expression for the total kinetic energy, again including kinetic correlation energy is evidently determined\ntherefore solely by \u03c1(r) and the derivative of log \u03c1(r).\nThus, the total kinetic energy density t(r) takes the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u00152\n\u03c1(r) 1 \u03c1\u2032 (r)\n1 \u03c1\u2032 (r)\n\u2212\n\u03c1(r). (15)\nt(r) = \u2212\n2 \u03c1(r) r=0 |r| 8 \u03c1(r) r=0\nIn closing this section we emphasize that in contrast to\nthe Moshinsky atom, the total kinetic energy including\ncorrelation now depends on both \u03c1(r) and \u2207\u03c1(r).\nV. DIFFERENTIAL SECOND-ORDER\nDENSITY MATRIX FORMULA FOR\nCORRELATION ENERGY DENSITY VIA A\nCOUPLING CONSTANT INTEGRATION\n\nThe differential level shift formula (4) for the correlation energy density \u01ebc (r) is entirely appropriate for twoelectron systems like the Moshinsky atom. But repeated\n\n\f4\nvolume integrations make it unwieldy for N -electron\nproblems, with N > 2. Therefore, in this section we derive an alternative route via a coupling constant integration. This leads to a formula for the L\u00f6wdin correlation\nenergy density \u01ebc (r) characterized by second-order density matrices. Since the development of efficient methods for the evaluation of second-order density matrices is\nin rapid progess, the reduced number of integrals to be\nevaluated can represent a helpful technical advancement,\nonce the expressions for the density matrices are already\nat hand.\nA.\n\nIntroductory example of uniform electron liquid\n\nTo point the way, let us consider the homogeneous electron liquid (HEL). As emphasized in early work, one of\nus [10, 11] has used as the 'coupling constant' the mean\ninterelectronic separation rs . A variant of HellmannFeynman theorem enables to express the ground-state\nenergy for the HEL (see e.g. [12] for a review). In particular, the ground-state energy per electron, E(rs ), satisfies the virial theorem [10]\n2T (rs ) + U (rs ) = \u2212rs\n\ndE\ndrs\n\n(16)\n\nwhere T and U represent kinetic and potential contributions, respectively. As shown by March and Young [11],\nremoving T = E \u2212 U from Eq. (16) allows the resulting\nfirst-order differential equation for E(rs ) to be integrated\nto yield\nE(\u03bb) = \u2212\u03bb\n\nZ\n\n\u03bb\n\nU (\u03bb)\nd\u03bb,\n\u03bb2\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03bb = rs2 plays the role of a coupling constant\nadiabatically connecting the unperturbed and the exact\nHamiltonians, as in Hellmann-Feynman theorem. But\nit is well known that EHF (rs ) = (A/rs2 ) \u2212 (B/rs ), with\n\u0001\n3\n9\u03c0 1/3\nA = 35 and B = 2\u03c0\n. Hence E(\u03bb) \u2212 EHF is known\n4\nvia a coupling constant integration. In HEL, U is determined by the diagonal element of the second-order density matrix, and hence we seek next a generalization of\n\n\u0393(r1 , r\u20321 ; r2 , r\u20322 ) =\n\nN (N \u2212 1)\n2\n\nZ\n\nsuch a formula for the L\u00f6wdin correlation energy for an\nN -electron system without the translational invariance\nof the HEL.\n\nB.\n\nCoupling constant formula\n\nMotivated by the above HEL example, we have gone\nback to the treatment by Stanton [13] of the L\u00f6wdin correlation energy E \u2212 EHF in terms of such a coupling constant integration. We write the Hamiltonian as\nH(\u03bb) = HHF + \u03bbH1 ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1 is a coupling constant adiabatically connecting the HF Hamiltonian to the exact Hamiltonian\nH \u2261 H(\u03bb = 1). Stanton [13] then generalizes HellmannFeynman's theorem to embrace the case of an N -particle\nHamiltonian. Beginning with\nR 1 the elementary identity\nE \u2212 EHF \u2261 E(1) \u2212 E(0) = 0 (dE(\u03bb)/d\u03bb)d\u03bb, Eq. (12)\nin Ref. [13] reads, in obvious notation,\n1\n\n\u2202H\n\u2202H\n|\u03a8(\u03bb)i \u2212 h\u03a6HF |\n|\u03a6HF i]d\u03bb,\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u2202\u03bb\n0\n(19)\nwhere \u03a8(\u03bb) is the ground-state eigenvector of the exact\nHamiltonian H(\u03bb) with eigenvalue E(\u03bb), and \u03a6HF is the\nHF ground-state with energy EHF . The scalar products\nh. . .i obviously imply an integration over the coordinates\nof N particles. The important point to stress here is that\ninstead of the quantum-mechanical average h\u03a8|H|\u03a6HF i\nentering the level shift formula, Eq. (4), Eq. (19) involves\n'symmetric' averages like h\u03a8|H|\u03a8i and h\u03a6HF |H|\u03a6HF i.\nThese, of course, are achieved at the cost of the coupling\nconstant integration. But since H(\u03bb = 1) involves only\none- and two-body operators, all the volume integrations\nbut two for an N -electron atom, molecule of cluster can\nbe achieved by use of the second-order density matrix\n\u0393(r1 , r\u20321 ; r2 , r\u20322 ) defined by [3]\nE \u2212 EHF =\n\nZ\n\n[h\u03a8(\u03bb)|\n\n\u03a8\u2217 (r1 , r2 , r3 , . . . rN )\u03a8(r\u20321 , r\u20322 , r3 , . . . rN )dr3 . . . drN .\n\n(20)\n\nInserting Eq. (20) into Eq. (19) we hence find\n\nE \u2212 EHF\n\n2\n=\nN (N \u2212 1)\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\nd\u03bb\n\nZ\n\ndr1 dr2 [h(r\u20321 , r\u20322 ) \u2212 hHF (r\u20321 , r\u20322 )] \u0393(r1 , r\u20321 ; r2 , r\u20322 ; \u03bb)|r\u2032 =r1 ,r\u2032 =r2 ,\n1\n\n2\n\n(21)\n\n\f5\nwhere use has been made of the following results:\n\u2202H(\u03bb)\n= H1 = H \u2212 HHF\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u2202H(\u03bb)\nh\u03a6HF |\n|\u03a6HF i = h\u03a6HF |H \u2212 HHF |\u03a6HF i = 0.\n\u2202\u03bb\n\n(22a)\n(22b)\n\nIn Eq. (21), the kernel h(r\u20321 , r\u20322 ) associated with the 'free' Hamiltonian has been defined in Eq. (3a), whereas the\nexpression of the Hartree-Fock kernel hHF (r\u20321 , r\u20322 will be given by Eq. (25) below.\nThe final step, as with the level shift formula Eq. (4), is to drop the volume integration over r2 and hence to\nachieve the desired result for the L\u00f6wdin correlation energy density \u01ebc (r1 ) as the coupling constant integration over\nsecond-order density matrices as\nZ 1 Z\n2\nd\u03bb dr2 [h(r\u20321 , r\u20322 ) \u2212 hHF (r\u20321 , r\u20322 )] \u0393(r1 , r\u20321 ; r2 , r\u20322 ; \u03bb)|r\u2032 =r1 ,r\u2032 =r2 ,\n(23)\n\u01ebc (r1 ) =\n1\n2\nN (N \u2212 1) 0\n\nThe explicit form of the HF kernel hHF (r1 , r2 ) in Eq. (23)\ncan be written as\n\nwhere the sum over k runs over the filled orbitals of the\nmean field problem. After explicitly writing the spin and\nspatial dependence, this expression takes the form\n\nhHF (r1 , r2 ) = h(r1 , r2 )\nZ\n\ndr3 v(r1 , r3 )\n\nX\n\n\u03a8k (r1 )\u03a8\u2217k (r2 ),\n\n+\u03b4(r1 \u2212 r2 )\n\u2212v(r1 , r2 )\n\nX\n\n\u03a8\u2217k (r3 )\u03a8k (r3 )\n\nk\n\n(24)\n\nk\n\nhHF (x1 , s1 ; x2 , s1 ) = h(x1 , x2 )\u03b4s1 s2\n+\u03b4s1 s2 \u03b4(x1 \u2212 x2 )\n\u2212v(x1 , x2 )\n\nX\n\nX Z\n\ndx3 v(x1 , x3 )\n\ns3 =\u00b11\n\nX\n\n\u03a8\u2217k (x3 , s3 )\u03a8k (x3 , s3 )\n\nk\n\n\u03a8k (x1 , s1 )\u03a8\u2217k (x2 , s2 ),\n\nwhere the single particle orbitals \u03a8k satisfy the HF equations\nZ\ndr2 hHF (r1 , r2 )\u03a8k (r2 ) = \u01ebk \u03a8k (r1 ).\nNow, the second-quantized HF Hamiltonian can be expressed as\nZ\nX1\nvk\nHHF =\ndr1 dr2 \u03a8\u2020 (r1 )hHF (r1 , r2 )\u03a8(r2 ) \u2212\n2\nk\nX\nX1\n=\n\u01ebk a\u2020k\u2032 ak \u2212\nvk\n2\nk\n\n(25)\n\nk\n\n(26)\n\n(27a)\n\nk\n\n\u01ebk = hk + vk\nZ\nhk =\ndr1 dr2 \u03a8\u2217k (r1 )h(r1 , r2 )\u03a8k (r2 ),\nXZ\nvk =\ndr1 dr2 \u03a8\u2217k (r1 )\u03a8\u2217k\u2032 (r2 )v(r1 , r2 ) (\u03a8k (r1 )\u03a8k\u2032 (r2 ) \u2212 \u03a8k\u2032 (r1 )\u03a8k (r2 )) .\n\n(27b)\n(27c)\n(27d)\n\nk\u2032\n\nIt should be noted that the field operator \u03a8(r) in the\nabove expressions are now constructed in terms of the\n\nsingle particle mean field orbitals.

It should also incorporate\nan additive constant which implements the property\nh\u03a6HF |HHF |\u03a6HF i = h\u03a6HF |H|\u03a6HF i = EHF .\n\nSUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\n\nThe two proposals made here for the correlation energy\ndensity \u01ebc (r1 ) are embodied in Eqs. (5) and (23). The\nfirst one involves knowledge of the exact many-electron\nground-state function \u03a8, which of course is generally not\navailable. For the Moshinsky two-electron atom model,\nhowever, both \u03a8 and its HF counterpart are known. Our\nresults show that the functional form of the correlation\nenergy density, HF and exact density is the same, in support of a simple proportionality expression.\nThe second proposal has a more general character. An\nintegration over a coupling constant \u03bb involving the second order density matrix must be accomplished. This\nalternative seems promising for solid state applications.\nHowever, we delay its analysis for further extensions of\nthis work. The homogenous electron liquid case of the socalled Sawada Hamiltonian (see [15]) would appear then\nto afford a promising starting point.\nFinally, returning to the level shift, the early analytical\nwork of Schwartz [8] on He-like atomic ions with large\nZ referred to in section 4, may provide further insight\ninto the use of the differential level shift formula (4).\nThis formula, of course, is readily generalized beyond this\ntwo-electron example, but applications then are likely to\ninvolve considerable computational effort.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge support from the\nICTP through the Condensed Matter Section.

In this approach the above mentioned additive constant is not required and the second quantized version of HHF becomes\na pure bilinear form in the creation and anihilation operators.\nWe can, so far, only see a way to evaluate Eq. (23)\nwholly analytically for the two-electron Moshinsky atom.\nBut we have not pressed the details of that ourselves,\nsince for this simple two-electron model the level shift\nformula has overwhelming advantages over the coupling\nconstant integration formula. But with recent progress\nin evaluating correlated two-body density matrices for\nsystems with N > 2, we expect Eq. (23) to rapidly become the advantageous route to employ [14].

(9a) and (9c) in the main text, that\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c1(0) exp(\u2212\u03b2r2 ),\n\u03c1HF (r) = \u03c1HF (0) exp(\u2212\u03b3r2 ).\n\n(A1)\n(A2)\n\nHence,\n\u03c1(r) \u2212 \u03c1HF (r) = \u03c1(0)(exp(\u2212r2 ))\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c1HF (0)(exp(\u2212r2 ))\u03b3 .\n(A3)\nBut we also have\n\u01ebc (r)\n\u01ebc (0)\n=\n(exp(\u2212r2 ))\u03b1 .\nEc\nEc\n\n(A4)\n\nHence from Eq. (A4) we can write\n2\n\nexp(\u2212r ) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u01ebc (r)\n\u01ebc (0)\n\n\u0013 \u03b11\n\n.\n\n(A5)\n\n\f7\nSubstituting this equation into Eq. (A3) we find,\n\u03c1(r) \u2212 \u03c1HF (r) = \u03c1(0)\n\n\u0012\n\n\u01ebc (r)\n\u01ebc (0)\n\n\u0013 \u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u2212 \u03c1HF (0)\n\n\u0012\n\n\u01ebc (r)\n\u01ebc (0)\n\n\u0013 \u03b1\u03b3\n\nAPPENDIX B: COUPLING CONSTANT\nINTEGRATION IN A GREEN FUNCTION\nFORMULA\n\n.\n\n(A6)\nThis appears to be a functional relation between\n\u01ebc (r)/\u01ebc (0) and \u03c1(r)\u2212\u03c1HF (r). But of course, on the RHS,\nthe four quantities \u03c1(0), \u03c1HF (0), \u03b3/\u03b1 and \u03b2/\u03b1 all depend\non the interaction strength k. However, one of these four\nquantities is sufficient to carry the fingerprints of k for\nthe others: we single out therefore \u03c1HF (0). But \u03c1(0) and\n\u03c1HF (0) are known from normalization of the densities to\ntwo. Hence we can write,\n\u03c1(0)\n=\n\u03c1HF (0)\n\n\u0012 \u0013 32\n\u03b2\n.\n\u03b3\n\n(A7)\n\nFollowing the discussion of Fetter and Walecka [16], we\nhere attempt to solve the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation for an arbitrary value of \u03bb, namely\nH(\u03bb)\u03a8(\u03bb) = E(\u03bb)\u03a8(\u03bb),\n\n(B1)\n\nwhere the wave function \u03a8 is assumed to be normalized:\nthat is h\u03a8(\u03bb)|\u03a8(\u03bb)i = 1. One immediately finds then\nfrom Eq. (B1) that\nE(\u03bb) = h\u03a8(\u03bb)|H(\u03bb)|\u03a8(\u03bb)i.\n(B2)\nDifferentiating with respect to the parameter \u03bb yields\n\nand also\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c1(0)(exp(\u2212r2 ))\u03b2\n\n(A8)\nd\nE(\u03bb) = h\u03a8(\u03bb)|H1 |\u03a8(\u03bb)i,\nd\u03bb\n\nplus\n2\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03c1HF (r) = \u03c1HF (0)(exp(\u2212r ))\n\n(A9)\nwhere H1 = H(\u03bb = 1) \u2212 HHF , in the present study.\nIntegrating this expression produces\n\nFrom the latter equations it follows that\n\u0013\u03b2\n\u0012 \u0013 32 \u0012\n\u03c1HF (r) \u03b3\n\u03b2\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c1HF (0)\n\u03b3\n\u03c1HF (0)\n\n(A10)\nE \u2212 E0 =\n\nSubstituting this equation in Eq. (A6) yields\n\u0012 \u0013 32 \u0012\n\u0013\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03c1HF (r) \u03b3\n\u03c1HF (r)\n\u2212\n=\n\u03b3\n\u03c1HF (0)\n\u03c1HF (0)\n\u0013\u03b2 \u0012\n\u0013\u03b3\n\u0012 \u0013 32 \u0012\n\u03b2\n\u01ebc (r) \u03b1\n\u01ebc (r) \u03b1\n\u2212\n. (A11)\n\u03b3\n\u01ebc (0)\n\u01ebc (0)\nNotice that the strength of the interaction does not appear explicitly in this formula. Figure 3 shows a three dimensional plot of \u01ebc (r)/\u01ebc (0), \u03c1HF (r) and \u03c1HF (0), where\nthe latter plays the role of the interaction strength k.\n\nE \u2212 EHF = \u00b1\n\ni\n2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\nd\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\nZ\n\ndr1 lim\n\n(B3)\n\nlim\n\nt\u2032 \u2192t+ r2 \u2192r1\n\n\u0014Z\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\nd\u03bb\nh\u03a8(\u03bb)|\u03bbH1 (\u03bb)|\u03a8(\u03bb)i.\n\u03bb\n\n(B4)\n\nHence again one is led to a level-shift formula, with E0\ndenoting the HF ground state energy but now via the\ncoupling constant integration in Eq. (B4).\nFetter and Walecka then display the way in which\nEq. (B4), for N electrons, can be reduced to integrations over just two vectors r1 and r2 , by means\nof a time-dependent Green function, denoted now by\nG\u03bb (r1 , t; r2 , t\u2032 ). This result, shown in their equation\n(7.31), then reads\n\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u2202\ndy\u03b4(r1 \u2212 y) i~ \u2212 hHF (r1 , y) Tr G\u03bb (y, t; r2 , t\u2032 ) ,\n\u2202t\n\n(B5)\n\nwhere in place of the kinetic energy operator, in our case the Fock operator hHF appears. As with the level-shift\nformula in section II, we now take the differential form of Eq. (B5) to find the second result proposed in the present\nstudy for the correlation energy density \u01ebc (r), namely\n\u0014Z\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012\nZ\ni 1 d\u03bb\n\u2202\n\u03bb\n\u2032\n\u01ebc (r1 ) = \u00b1\nlim lim\n\u2212\nh\n(r\n,\ny)\nTr\nG\n(y,\nt;\nr\n,\nt\n)\n.\n(B6)\ndy\u03b4(r\n\u2212\ny)\ni~\nHF 1\n2\n1\n2 0 \u03bb t\u2032 \u2192t+ r\u2032 \u2192r\n\u2202t\n\nWhile Eq. (B6) is able to furnish a local definition of cor-\n\nrelation energy density, the explicit determination of the\n\n\f8\nGreen function G\u03bb (r1 , t; r2 , t\u2032 ) represents a considerable\nchallenge.\nIt is worth noticing that when the Green function\nis taken in \u0001the HF approximation, since the operator\n\u2202\n\u2212 hHF furnishes the inverse of this HF Green funci~ \u2202t\ntion, it follows that the correlation energy vanishes as it\nshould do, since its definition is the difference between\nthe exact energy E and the HF value EHF . This property has an interesting implication. Let us assume that\nthe correlation energy density defined in Eq. (4) has a\ndependence on r which closely follows the one associated\nof the HF density (or the exact one ) [2]. Then, from\ndefinition (B6) it follows that the HF correction to the\npropagator does not contribute at all to the correlation\nenergy. Therefore, the approximate validity of the correlation energy density formula proposed in [2] means\nthat the contributions to the correlation energy density\ncoming from the higher order corrections to the Green\nfunction, should approximately follow the behavior of either the total or the HF density. Therefore, the validity\nof the proposals of [2] for the correlation energy density,\ndirectly implies that the exact (or the HF) density should\nhave a close relation with the exact or the HF densities.\nThis conclusion arises because the higher corrections to\nthe HF density turn to be approximately proportional to\nthe same exact (or HF) densities as implied by the correctness of the definitions given in [2]. This property is\nsupported by the analytical results of section III in which\na close similarity between the HF electron density and the\ncorrelation energy density emerged. These general issues\nare expected to be analyzed in future extensions of the\nwork.\nReturning briefly to the theme of the correlation en-\n\n[1] A. Cabo, F. Claro, E. Men\u00e9ndez-Proupin, N.

(B6) a formula\ninvolving the Green function G\u03bb which can be brought\ninto contact with a similar result for the level shift formula. Let us note that Eq. (B6), as well as Eq. (4), can\nalways be rewritten in the form:\n\u01ebc (r1 ) =\n\nZ\n\nC(r1 , r2 )dr2\n\n(B7)\n\nfollowing a similar generalization for kinetic and exchange energy densities, but now in HF theory, proposed\nby March and Santamaria [17, 18]. Then the level shift\n(LS) formula, Eq. (4) reads\nC\n\nLS\n\n(r1 , r2 ) =\n\nR\n\n\u03a8\u2217 [H \u2212 HHF ]\u03a6HF dr3 . . . rN\nR\n.\n\u03a8\u2217 \u03a6HF dr1 . . . drN\n\n(B8)\n\nThe conventional exact wavefunction (WF) theory reads\nR \u2217\nR \u2217\n\u03a8 H\u03a8dr3 . . . drN\n\u03a6 H\u03a6HF dr3 . . . drN\nC WF (r1 , r2 ) = R \u2217\n\u2212 R HF\n.\n\u03a8 \u03a8dr1 . . . drN\n\u03a6\u2217HF \u03a6HF dr1 . . . drN\n(B9)\nWhile, in general, these forms of C(rR1 , r2 ) are different,\nthey must all integrate to the same \u01ebc (r1 )dr1 . This is\ntrue also for the two coupling constant integration formulae derivable from Eqs. (23) and (B6).\nWhat we stress in this Appendix is the N -particle character of Eqs. (B8) and (B9), and the Green function generalization of C(r1 , r2 ) following from Eq. (B5). To date,\nof course, analytical progress is restricted to the Moshinsky atom. But since we have treated this fully in the\nbody of the text, we shall omit further details.\n\n305, 429 (1999).\n[10] N. H. March, Phys. Rev. 110, 604 (1958).\n[11] N. H. March and W. H.
