The principal goal of the PPTA is to make a direct detection of gravitational waves (Hobbs 2005; Manchester 2006). For this\npurpose it is necessary to measure weekly times of arrival\n(TOAs) of \u223c20 pulsars with a precision between 100 and\n500 ns (Jenet et al. 2005). In order to achieve this goal all\nsystematic errors in the TOAs must be considered and, if\npossible, corrected. One such correction is the delay caused\nby the plasma between the pulsar and the Earth. Most of\nthis plasma contribution is from the interstellar medium,\nbut the contribution of the solar wind cannot be neglected\nand the ionosphere will occasionally be important. The dis-\n\n\u22c6\n\nEmail: xpyou@bao.ac.cn\n\npersion in the plasma is a linear effect and can, in principle\nbe corrected exactly. The group delay, tg (\u03bd), is related to\nthe integral of the electron density, ne , from the Earth to\nthe pulsar, tg (\u03bd) = DM/(K\u03bd 2 ), where\nZ L\nDM =\nne dl,\n(1)\n0\n\nis the \"dispersion measure\". The dispersion constant K \u2261\n2.410 \u00d7 10\u22124 MHz\u22122 cm\u22123 pc s\u22121 , \u03bd is the observing frequency and L the distance from the Earth to the pulsar.\nWhen TOAs, tg1 and tg2 , are measured at two frequencies,\n\u03bd1 and \u03bd2 , the DM can be estimated using\nDM = K\n\ntg2 \u2212 tg1\n.\n\u03bd2\u22122 \u2212 \u03bd1\u22122\n\n(2)\n\nA rough estimate of the DM of a (radio) pulsar is generally obtained from the discovery observations. This estimate\ncan be quickly refined by re-observing the pulsar with more\nwidely separated frequencies. Measured DMs for currently\n\n\f2\n\nX. P. You et al.\n\nknown radio pulsars lie between 2.38 and 1235 cm\u22123 pc and\nfrom 2.65 to 244 cm\u22123 pc for the subset of millisecond pulsars (Manchester et al. 2005)1 .\nPrecise measurements of DM show that it often has significant time variations. A time delay of 100 ns at an observing frequency of 1400 MHz, the accuracy goal of the PPTA,\ncorresponds to a DM variation of 4.72 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm\u22123 pc. Variations of this order can occur in the ionosphere only for\nzenith angles in excess of 80\u25e6 or during major geomagnetic\nstorms, so ionospheric corrections will not normally be necessary. At this level of timing precision, significant variations\nin DM can occur due to the solar wind even when the pulsar is 60\u25e6 away from the Sun. Variations in the interstellar\nplasma DM result from plasma turbulence and usually have\na Kolmogorov power spectrum, implying that the variations\nare larger over longer time-scales. In the pulsars observed\nby the PPTA project, such DM fluctuations can reach levels\nthat require correction within a few days or weeks.\nIt is clear that the goals of the PPTA project cannot\nbe reached without measuring the DM and correcting for\nthe plasma delay for each observation. The most precise\nTOA measurements are usually obtained at a frequency of\n1400 MHz, but the only dual-band receiver available at the\nParkes telescope is at 685 and 3100 MHz. Thus the DM variations are measured using the dual-band system at different\ntimes than the TOA observations at 1400 MHz. Since the\nDM varies relatively smoothly, the DM correction can be\ninterpolated to the epoch of the primary TOA observation.\nIn this paper we use the first few years of DM measurements\nto test methods of correcting for the solar wind, to study the\ninterstellar plasma turbulence and to derive algorithms for\ncorrecting the TOA measurements.\n\n2\n\nCAUSES OF DM VARIATIONS\n\nThe contributions of the ionosphere and the solar wind have\nbeen well-studied and can be estimated by various methods\nindependently of the PPTA. The total electron content of\nthe ionosphere (\"TEC\") is regularly monitored because it\nis needed to correct the Global Positioning System (GPS)\nnavigational system. A monitor is located at the Parkes observatory, but it is seldom necessary to make this correction.\nCorrections for the solar wind are implemented in the standard pulsar timing codes tempo and tempo2 (Hobbs et al.\n2006; Edwards et al. 2006). However, these assume a spherically symmetric solar wind with a constant scale factor and\ndo not model observed variations in wind density with latitude, longitude and time which can be as much as a factor of four at any distance (McComas et al. 2000). The earlier package, tempo, assumes a higher density compared to\ntempo2. Neither of these is adequate for the desired PPTA\nprecision.\nThe DM due to the interstellar medium varies for a\nvariety of reasons. For example, variations are known to\noccur for some pulsars within supernova remnants, when\nwisps of ionised gas drift across the line of sight to the pulsar. For instance, the DM of the Vela pulsar decreased at a\nrate of 0.04 cm\u22123 pc yr\u22121 from 1970 to 1985 (Hamilton et al.\n\n1\n\nhttp://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat\n\n1985). Similarly the Crab pulsar shows variations up to\n0.02 cm\u22123 pc yr\u22121 over 15 yr (Lyne et al. 1988). Pulsars in\nbinary systems which exhibit eclipses show DM variations\nfrom the ionised envelope of the companion object. These\nhave been measured for two of the binary pulsars in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (Freire et al. 2003). The DM change\nof 0.0065 cm\u22123 pc for one of these, PSR J0023\u22127203J, is\n100 times the level that would require correction for the\nPPTA pulsars. Even larger changes have been observed in\nPSR B1259\u221263 which is in orbit with a massive B2e star,\nreaching 10.7 and 7.7 cm\u22123 pc during the periastron passages\nof 1994 and 1997, respectively (Wang et al. 2004).\nThe DM also varies due to turbulent spatial variations\nwhich drift across the line of sight between the Earth and the\npulsar. These have commonly been characterised in the literature as linear slopes in DM. Measurements of such dDM/dt\nvalues for four pulsars were discussed by Backer et al. (1993)\nwho proposed that dDM/dt \u221d (DM)1/2 and modelled the\nvariation using wedges of enhanced density. Observations of\n374 pulsars were presented by Hobbs et al. (2004) who found\nthe same relationship. However, a better characterisation of\nthe DM variations can be made using the theoretical spatial characteristics of a turbulent process. As shown later,\nin a turbulent model the relation dDM/dt \u221d (DM)1/2 arises\nnaturally and does not require a wedge model. The spatial\npower spectrum of electron density was defined by Rickett\n(1990) as\nP (q) = Cn2 q \u2212\u03b2 ;\n\n2\u03c0/lo < q < 2\u03c0/li ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Cn2 scales the power spectrum (and thus the total energy in the process), \u03b2 is the power-law exponent (which is\n11/3 for a Kolmogorov spectrum), lo is the outer scale and\nli is the inner scale. Physically the outer scale is identified\nwith the largest scale in the medium, typically the size at\nwhich it becomes inhomogeneous, and the inner scale is the\nscale at which dissipation occurs. Energy is introduced at\nsome scale between lo and li , supporting the spectrum. This\nenergy 'cascades' in frequency to li where it is dissipated.\nTurbulent variations in electron density can be estimated\nfrom DM variations and various diffractive phenomena such\nas angular scattering, pulse broadening and intensity scintillations. Diffractive variations are caused by much smaller\nscale fluctuations in density and thus probe different regions\nof the spatial spectrum than DM variations. Diffractive variations are modulated by refractive variations which can be\nused to probe scales between the diffractive and the DM\nscales. All these observed variations result from the motion\nof the line of sight through the scattering medium, thus spatial variations of scale s are associated with temporal variations of scale T by s = V T where V is the velocity of the line\nof sight with respect to the scattering plasma. Therefore, the\ninner time-scale \u03c4i corresponds to li = V \u03c4i .\nRadio scattering observations, such as those mentioned\nabove, are directly sensitive to a statistic called the \"phase\nstructure function\", D\u03c6 (\u03c4 ), which is defined by\nD\u03c6 (\u03c4 ) = h[\u03c6(t + \u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03c6(t)]2 i,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the geometrical phase delay between the source\nand the observer and the angle brackets denote an ensemble\naverage. For a power-law spatial spectrum with 2 < \u03b2 < 4\nbetween the inner and outer scales, the structure function\n\n\fDM Variations and Pulsar Timing\nD\u03c6 is given by (Rickett 1977):\n\u03b1\n\nD\u03c6 (\u03c4 ) = (\u03c4 /\u03c4d ) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = \u03b2\u22122. Similarly, we can define a structure function\nfor the DM variations:\nDDM (\u03c4 ) = h[DM(t + \u03c4 ) \u2212 DM(t)]2 i.\n\n(6)\n\nAt scales that are larger than the scale of refractive scintillation, the geometrical phase approaches the actual phase\n(Coles et al. 1991) and these two structure functions can be\nrelated through the dispersion relation (Equation 2),\nDDM (\u03c4 ) = (K\u03bd/2\u03c0)2 D\u03c6 (\u03c4 ).\n\n(7)\n\nThe structure function was first used to investigate\nDM variations by Rickett (1988). Subsequently, the technique was applied to PSR J1939+2134 (B1937+21)\nby Cordes et al. (1990), Kaspi et al. (1994) and\nRamachandran et al. (2006). Cordes et al. (1990) showed\nthat the structure function was consistent with a power-law\nfluctuation spectrum with index \u03b2 between 11/3, the\nKolmogorov value, and 4. Kaspi et al. (1994) continued this\nwork and obtained \u03b2 = 3.874\u00b10.011. From the approximate\nagreement of the diffractive timescale \u03c4d computed from\nEquation 5 and the directly measured value, Cordes et al.\n(1990) inferred that the inner scale of the fluctuation\nspectrum, li , was less than about 2 \u00d7 107 m. Recently,\nRamachandran et al. (2006) extended the data-span to\n20 yr and obtained \u03b2 = 3.66 \u00b1 0.04 which is consistent\nwith the value expected for a Kolmogorov spectrum and\nsuggested li \u223c 1.3 \u00d7 109 m. Cognard & Lestrade (1997) presented the DM variations of a different millisecond pulsar,\nPSR J1824\u22122452 (B1821\u221224), and obtained \u03b2 = 3.7 \u00b1 0.2\nwhich is also consistent with a Kolmogorov spectrum. Dispersion measure variations were measured for six pulsars by\nPhillips & Wolszczan (1991) and structure functions were\nobtained for PSRs B0834+06, B0823+26 and B0919+06.\nMeasured power-law indices were in the range 3.77 to 3.87\nwith uncertainties of 0.04 or less.\nAssuming that the DM variations are due to turbulence then, from the definition of the structure function, the\n\"slope\" dDM/dt, averaged over an interval \u03c4 , will be a random variable with an rms of [DDM (\u03c4 )]1/2 /\u03c4 . This can be\nrelated to the mean DM value by the distance to the pulsar\nL as both DM and DDM (\u03c4 ) are proportional to L. Thus the\nobserved result that dDM/dt \u221d (DM)1/2 is expected for any\nturbulent medium and does not require ad hoc models such\nas the wedge model of Backer et al. (1993). This proportionality will be valid for spatial scales V \u03c4 that are less than the\nparsec scale of interstellar clouds, since it assumes that contributions to the DM fluctuations from various points on the\nline of sight add incoherently.\nThere have been three dissipation mechanisms discussed in the literature: ion cyclotron damping (which is the\nprimary mechanism in the solar wind), Landau damping and\nion-neutral collisional damping. It is not thought that Landau damping is important in the ISM (Minter & Spangler\n1997). Ion cyclotron damping will certainly occur if the turbulent cascade reaches the small spatial scales involved. It\noccurs at the ion inertial scale (Coles & Harmon 1989),\np\nLi = 684 km/ ne (cm\u22123 )\n(8)\n\nand has been clearly observed in the solar wind. Expected\n\n3\n\nscales in the ISM range from 300 to 3000 km and it has almost certainly been observed at scales of 300 to 800 km using\npulse broadening observations (Bhat et al. 2004). Damping\ndue to ion-neutral collisions is also a resonant process that\noccurs near the ion-neutral collision frequency and would\nresult in scales of \u223c30 AU in typical warm ISM conditions\n(Minter & Spangler 1997).\n\n3\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS\n\nThe PPTA, which commenced observations in February 2004, uses the Parkes 64-m radio telescope to\nmake timing observations of 20 millisecond pulsars. One,\nPSR J1824\u22122452, lies within the globular cluster M28, the\nothers within the disk of our Galaxy. Table 1 lists basic parameters for the 20 PPTA pulsars: J2000 name, period (P ),\nperiod derivative (\u1e56 ), orbital period (Pb ) if the pulsar is in\na binary system, DM, distance based on the NE2001 electron density model (Cordes & Lazio 2002) unless the annual\nparallax or another independent distance estimate is available, total proper motion (\u03bc) and ecliptic latitude (bE ). Because PSRs J1022+1001 and J1730\u22122304 lie very close to\nthe ecliptic plane, timing methods cannot provide a precise\nproper motion in ecliptic latitude; for these two pulsars the\nproper motion in ecliptic longitude is given. Each pulsar is\ntypically observed at intervals of 2\u20133 weeks at frequencies\nclose to 685 MHz (50 cm), 1400 MHz (20 cm) and 3100 MHz\n(10 cm), where the band designations (based on wavelength)\nare given in parentheses. We have used three backend systems: a wideband correlator (WBC), a digital filterbank system (DFB1)2 and the Caltech-Parkes-Swinburne Recorder\n2 (CPSR2), a coherent dedispersing system, all of which\nrecord orthogonal linear polarisations. The WBC provides\n2-bit sampling with a bandwidth of up to 1024 MHz for the\nearlier data. The DFB1 was installed in 2005 June and allows\n8-bit sampling of a 256 MHz bandwidth at 10 cm and 20 cm.\nObservations at 10 and 50 cm are obtained simultaneously\nusing a dual-band receiver providing bandwidths of 64 MHz\nat 50 cm and 1024 MHz at 10 cm. Most observations at 20 cm\nare made using the central beam of the Parkes multibeam\nreceiver although the \"H-OH\" receiver has occasionally been\nused for observations in this band. Data are simultaneously\nrecorded using the CPSR2 baseband recording system with\n2-bit sampling of two 64-MHz bands, centred on 1341 and\n1405 MHz respectively, and either the WBC or DFB1 with\n256 MHz bandwidth. At 50 cm, data are recorded using one\nband of CPSR2. For all receivers, a linearly polarised broadband calibration signal can be injected into the feed at 45\u25e6\nto the two signal probes.\nObservation times per pulsar are typically either 32 min\nor 64 min and data are folded on-line with sub-integration\ntimes of 1 min for the WBC and DFB1 and 16 s for CPSR2.\nAll pulsar observations are preceded by a short (2 min)\nobservation of a pulsed calibration signal. For most pulsars the WBC and DFB1 data are split into 512 frequency\nchannels with between 256 and 1024 phase bins across the\npulse period. For CPSR2, the data are coherently dedispersed in each of 128 frequency channels with 1024 phase\n2\n\nA new digital filterbank system (DFB2) with a wider bandwidth and improved resolution is currently under construction.\n\n\f4\n\nX.

Off-line processing uses the psrchive software system\n(Hotan et al. 2004). For all recording systems, data from\nfrequency channels or sub-integrations which are obviously\naffected by radio-frequency interference are excised, as are\nchannels from the outer edges of the band (typically about 5\nper cent of the band at each edge) where the system gain is\nlow. Data are then calibrated for variations of instrumental\ngain and phase across the band using observations of the\npulsed calibration signal and the Stokes parameters formed.\nFor all pulsars except PSR J0437\u22124715, pulse TOAs\nwere obtained by cross-correlating a template profile with\nthe Stokes I mean pulse profile for each observation. For\nmost of the observed pulsars, errors in the calibration procedure resulted in TOA errors which were less than the\nuncertainty due to random (receiver) noise. However for\nPSR J0437\u22124715 at 20 cm and 50 cm, this was not the case\nand it was advantageous to use the polarimetric invariant\ninterval instead of Stokes I (Britton et al. 2000). Template\nprofiles were formed for each instrument and each observing frequency (685, 1341, 1405 MHz for CPSR2, 1369 and\n3100 MHz for the DFB1, 1433 and 3100 MHz for the WBC)\nby weighted summing of all available data to form 'grand\naverage' profiles and then blanking the baseline regions. Figure 1 shows the grand average Stokes I profiles at the three\nfrequencies for all 20 pulsars (except for PSR J2129\u22125721\nwhere we have data for two frequencies only).\nFor DM measurements, profile alignment across frequencies is an important issue. The template profiles for\na given pulsar were approximately aligned using the crosscorrelation of each profile with a reference profile. However,\nbecause of frequency-dependent profile variations, there remains some uncertainty in the true alignment. In this work,\nwe are primarily concerned with variations in DM, not absolute values, so arbitrary phase offsets between data obtained\nusing different systems were included in the timing model.\n\nThe resulting TOAs were analysed using tempo2. Timing model parameters were obtained by fitting standard pulsar timing parameters (including astrometric, spin and binary parameters) to the 20 cm and/or the 10 cm observations3 . As we are interested in DM variations, we do not\nfit for any time derivatives of the DM as part of the timing model; however, we do allow tempo2 to model the DM\nvariations due to the solar wind (this is further discussed in\n\u00a75.2). The timing model parameters were subsequently held\nconstant in order to obtain timing residuals at all observing\nfrequencies.\nTo obtain the time variations in DM, \u2206DM(t), we fitted Equation 2 to segments of timing data. The segment\nlengths were adjusted so that each segment contained at\nleast one observation at each frequency (typically 1 or 2\nweeks). Initially we used the 10 and 50 cm observations to\nobtain \u2206DM(t) because these were obtained simultaneously\nand are well separated in frequency. However, if the pulse\nprofile at 10 cm or 50 cm has a low signal-to-noise ratio, we\nalso used 20 and 50 cm or 10 and 20 cm to obtain \u2206DM(t).\nThe structure function is a useful statistic for studying\nthe physical process causing the DM variations. Calculation of the structure function is straightforward, even for\nunequally-spaced data (Equation 6). However, the estimation of the errors in the structure function due to uncertainties in the \u2206DM(t) values, and due to the finite duration\nof the \u2206DM(t) series has not been discussed consistently in\nthe literature. Because of the irregular data-sampling, \u03c4 represents a \"bin\" with a width which we have adjusted to give\n\n3\n\nWe use residuals obtained using CPSR2, WBC and DFB1.\nHowever, for a few pulsars with high DM and short period,\nthe WBC profile is significantly smeared and therefore, for\nPSRs J0613\u22120200, J1600\u22123053, J1824\u22122452, J1939+2134, we\nonly use the CPSR2 and DFB1 observations.\n\n\fDM Variations and Pulsar Timing\n\n5\n\nFigure 1. Stokes I profiles for the 20 millisecond pulsars in our sample. For each pulsar we give the 50 cm, 20 cm and 10 cm profiles from\ntop to bottom respectively (except for PSR J2129\u22125721 where only 50 cm and 20 cm profiles are available).\n\nroughly equal logarithmic sampling. Estimation of DDM (\u03c4 )\nfor a power-law process from a single \"realisation\" of the process incurs a significant error which has been discussed by\nRickett et al. (2000). For Kolmogorov processes they found\nthat the estimation error \u03c3est (\u03c4 ) \u221d D(\u03c4 )[\u03c4 /(T \u2212\u03c4 )]1/3 where\nT represents the data-span. We have extended their simulations to pure power-law processes which do not have a defined low frequency limit (or \"outer scale\"). For uniformly\nsampled data from a Kolmogorov process we find that\n\u03c3est (\u03c4 ) = 1.66D(\u03c4 )(\u03c4 /T )1/3 .\n\n(9)\n\nAssuming that the process itself has Gaussian differences,\nthe structure function estimator must be \u03c72 -distributed,\nand defined by Ndof , the number of degrees of freedom.\nThe estimation error can be written in terms of Ndof as\n\u03c3est (\u03c4 ) = D(\u03c4 )(2/Ndof )0.5 , so Ndof = 0.72(T /\u03c4 )2/3 . As our\ndata are irregularly sampled we sometimes have fewer pairs,\nNp , or fewer samples, Ns , contributing than Ndof . We therefore approximate the actual number of degrees of freedom\nas the minimum of (Np , Ns , Ndof ).\nIn addition to the estimation error discussed above,\nwhich is the amount by which a single realisation of a random process can be expected to depart from the theoretical\nmean, we must consider the fact that the measurements include a white noise component independent of DM(t). We\nassume that the errors on the \u2206DM(t) values are independent, Gaussian and have known, but different, standard de-\n\nviations. These contribute a different bias and error to each\nDest (\u03c4 ) which are computed by expanding each Dest (\u03c4 ) as\nshown in Appendix A.\nOur work contrasts with earlier estimates of the structure function. In earlier work, the uncertainty on the structure function was either estimated as the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of points\n(Cordes et al. 1990) or as the smaller of the number of points\nand (T /\u03c4 ) (Ramachandran et al. 2006). The choice of the\nbias term which is subtracted from DDM (\u03c4 ) has also been inconsistent in the literature. Usually the bias has been taken\nas the average of the \u2206DM(t) errors. This method is only\naccurate when the number of points is very large and the\nerror on \u2206DM(t) is significantly smaller than its value. Earlier work also did not allow for the error on the measured\n\u2206DM(t) values which, for some data-sets, is very important.\nIt is useful to obtain the diffractive time-scale, \u03c4d , and\nbandwidth, \u03bdd , for each pulsar to compare with the DDM (\u03c4 ).\nFor many pulsars we were able to obtain these values from\nthe literature. Table 2 gives these \u03c4d and \u03bdd values. In column order, the Table contains the pulsar name, observing\nfrequency, \u03c4d , \u03bdd and a bibliographic reference. However, no\nmeasurements existed for nine of our pulsars. As our data\nhave relatively poor frequency and time resolution (for this\npurpose), we obtained \u03c4d and \u03bdd using a structure function\nanalysis (Rickett et al. 2000) rather than the more standard\nmethod of using the auto-correlation function of the dy-\n\n\f6\n\nX.

The\nscatter in \u03c4d observations is much greater than the error\nbars on individual \u03c4d measurements. We have confirmed, by\nsimulation, that the reason for this is that \u03c4d is estimated\nfrom observations which are much shorter than the refractive scale.\nFor three pulsars it was difficult for us to obtain\ndiffractive time-scale measurements. For PSR J0437\u22124715,\nthis is not a problem as there are many measurements\navailable in the literature. The diffractive time-scale for\nPSR J1824\u22122452 is too short at 20 cm (less than 1 min) for\nus to measure. At 10 cm, this pulsar is very weak (SNR \u223c20\nfor a 1 hr observation), but we were able to obtain a few usable observations. The \u03c4d for PSR J2124\u22123358 is relatively\nlong. From the \u03c4d = 44 min at 436 MHz (Johnston et al.\n1998), we can estimate that \u03c4d at 685 MHz is \u223c76 min, but\nour current observation time for this pulsar is only 32 min.\n\n4.2\n\nStructure functions\n\nWe have calculated structure functions from \u2206DM(t) for\neach of our pulsars. Representative examples are shown in\nFigure 3 and Figure 4. In these figures, we have included \u03c4d\nmeasurements obtained from the literature (cross-symbols)\nor from our data (open triangle symbols). For some pulsars, we have been able to derive an estimate of DDM at\nlarge time lags from dDM/dt measurements in the literature\n(Hobbs et al. 2004) that were obtained using a single dataset4 ; such points are indicated using a full square-symbol at\nthe rightmost edge of the plot. To put the data in context, we\nhave drawn two theoretical lines fitted through the \u03c4d points,\n4\n\nA given dDM/dt measurement can be converted to a single\npoint on a structure function as (dDM/dt * T )2 , where T is the\ndata span.\n\n\fDM Variations and Pulsar Timing\n\n7\n\nFigure 2. DM variations of 20 millisecond pulsars. Note a \u2206DM of 10\u22124 cm\u22123 pc corresponds to time delays at 10 cm of 43 ns, at 20 cm\nof 212 ns and at 50 cm of 884 ns.\n\n\f8\n\nX. P. You et al.\n\nFigure 3. Structure functions, DDM (\u03c4 ) for four pulsars. The \u03c4d derived estimates are marked by triangles from our data and crosses\nfrom the literature. The estimates obtained directly from the time series \u2206DM(t) as discussed in Appendix A are marked as filled circles\nwith error bars. Open circles indicate a negative estimate. A Kolmogorov model fit to \u03c4d is shown using a solid line and a quadratic\nmodel is shown dash-dotted. Confidence limits on the Kolmogorov model are solid lines bracketting the model. Equivalent delays at\n1400 MHz are shown for 100 ns and 1 \u03bcs. For PSR J1022+1001, a point derived from dDM/dt is shown as a solid box with error bars at\nthe longest time lag.\n\none (full line) with the Kolmogorov exponent (\u03b1 = 5/3),\nthe other (dashed-dotted line) with \u03b1 = 2 corresponding\nto the steepest possible structure function resulting from\nplasma turbulence (Rickett 1990) (hereafter, this spectrum\nis known as \"quadratic\"). Estimation error bounds on the\ntheoretical Kolmogorov model (at the 68% confidence level)\nfor each data point are plotted using solid lines that bracket\nthe theoretical model.\nThe remaining symbols used on the figures are as follows. The structure function values measured from \u2206DM(t)\nare plotted using solid circle symbols. The errors on these\npoints are estimated from the uncertainty on \u2206DM(t). For\ncases where the error is larger than the value we use downward pointing arrow symbols for the lower bound on the\nerror bar. As we subtracted the bias due to the uncertainties on the \u2206DM(t) measurements, it is possible for large\nuncertainties on \u2206DM(t) that the structure function values\nare negative. We indicate such points using open circles and\na downward arrow plotted at DDM (\u03c4 ) plus twice its error.\nThe structure function plots all have the same scaling.\nFor comparison, we also indicate the value of DDM\nthat would be expected for white timing residuals with a\ngiven rms (\u03c3rms ) at 1400 MHz. The relationship between\n\nthe structure function of the timing residuals, DTOA , and\nthe structure function of DM variations, DDM , is\nDDM = DTOA (K\u03bd 2 )2 .\n\n(11)\n\n2\nIf the timing residuals are white, then DT OA = 2\u03c3rms\n. We\nindicate, using solid horizontal lines, white noise with an rms\nof 1 \u03bcs and 100 ns.\nFor PSRs J1045\u22124509, J1824\u22122452 and J1909\u22123744\nwe have added an indication of the inner time-scale (see\n\u00a75.3). For PSRs J1939+2134 and J1824\u22122452, we also overlay a dotted line which is the structure function from earlier\nwork (see \u00a75.3).\nOur \u03c4d values for PSR J0437\u22124715 can be compared\nwith the work of Smirnova et al. (2006) who scaled the observations of Johnston et al. (1998) and Gothoskar & Gupta\n(2000) by a large factor, assuming that the scintillation\nindex was much smaller than unity, although the scintillation index was not reported by the original observers.\nSmirnova et al. (2006) deduced a phase structure function\nwhich is two orders of magnitude lower than ours in the\nvicinity of \u03c4d .\n\n\fDM Variations and Pulsar Timing\n\n9\n\nFigure 4.

Two, PSRs J0437\u22124715 and J1939+2134,\nfit the Kolmogorov model well. Two, PSRs J1045\u22124509\n\nand J1909\u22123744, are clearly inconsistent with a pure Kolmogorov power law, requiring a large inner scale. One,\nPSR J1824\u22122452, has few good \u03c4d measurements, but may\nwell have \u03c4i > \u03c4d .

Two pulsars (PSRs J1744\u22121134, J1857+0943) could\nnot be classified on the basis of our measurements, but\nappear to be Kolmogorov on the basis of previously published dDM/dt values. For five pulsars (PSRs J0613\u22120200,\nJ1600\u22123053, J1643\u22121224, J1713+0747 and J1732\u22125049)\nthe structure functions fall below the quadratic model\nat large time lags, strongly suggesting that the underlying spectrum is Kolmogorov. The final three pulsars\n(PSRs J1603\u22127202, J1730\u22122304 and J2124\u22123358) appear\nto follow the quadratic model at large lags. However it\nshould be realised that the structure functions at large lags\nare relatively poorly estimated and this separation of the\npulsars into different categories is not perfectly clear.\nThe results described above lead us to propose that the\nstructure functions for all our pulsars contain an ISM component that is either a pure Kolmogorov power-law or a\nKolmogorov power-law with a large inner scale.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nDISCUSSION OF DM MEASUREMENTS\nComparison with earlier work\n\nMuch of the earlier work has concentrated on measuring\n(and modelling) dDM/dt values (e.g. Backer et al. 1993;\nHobbs et al. 2004). For comparison with earlier work we\nhave listed in Table 3 the slope of the best-fitting straight\nline across the entire data-set for each of our pulsars,\ndDM/dt. Our values generally do not agree with the previously published values. However, for our data-sets, a single dDM/dt value models the observed \u2206DM(t) values well\nonly for a few pulsars (PSRs J1045\u22124509, J1824\u22122452\nand J1909\u22123744) and the dDM/dt values for other pulsars\n\nare misleading. For instance, for PSR J0437\u22124715 our results indicate that the DM evolution for this pulsar can\nroughly be described using three dDM/dt values: prior to\nMJD 53400 dDM/dt = (\u22122.98 \u00b1 0.07) \u00d7 10\u22124 cm\u22123 pc yr\u22121 ,\nbetween MJD 53400 and 53700, dDM/dt = (6.2 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7\n10\u22124 cm\u22123 pc yr\u22121 and subsequently dDM/dt = (3 \u00b1 1) \u00d7\n10\u22125 cm\u22123 pc yr\u22121 . Clearly, the \u2206DM(t) values are better described using the structure function.\n5.2\n\nThe solar wind\n\nThe solar wind leads to a significant change in DM for pulsars close to the ecliptic plane during close approaches of the\nline of sight to the pulsar with the Sun. According to the\ntempo2 model described in \u00a72, an unmodelled solar wind\ncontributes \u223c100 ns at 1400 MHz for sources within 60\u25e6 of\nthe Sun and \u223c1 \u03bcs within 7\u25e6 . It is therefore clear that corrections are necessary for 18 out of our 20 PPTA pulsars. The\ncorrection can potentially be made by modelling the solar\nwind or by directly measuring the DM to sufficient accuracy\nusing multiple frequency observations.\nThe solar wind varies with time and position. An\noverview of the relevant solar physics can be found in\nSchwenn (2006). Most of the variations in the solar wind\nare ascribed to a slowly changing spatial pattern that rotates with a 27-day period. In addition global transients,\ncalled coronal mass ejections (CME), occur every few days.\nThe chances of a given observation, which typically has\na duration of 30-60 min, encountering a CME are only a\nfew percent, so these are not the most important effects.\nThe quasi-static spatial pattern is roughly bimodal, the\n\"slow solar wind\" with high electron density is concentrated\nwithin about \u00b120\u25e6 (McComas et al. 2000) and the \"fast solar wind\" with lower electron densities at higher latitudes.\nThe density difference is a factor of four at 1 AU and increases near the Sun. The correction necessary for a given\nobservation can then vary by a factor of four depending on\nhow much of the line of sight is in the slow versus the fast\nwind.\nCorrections for the solar wind have been attempted\nin both tempo and tempo2. Both programs implement\nconstant-density spherically symmetric models. Tempo uses\na high density model where the electron density at 1 AU,\nne (1AU) = 10 cm\u22123 , whereas tempo2 has a lower density model of ne (1AU) = 4 cm\u22123 . Splaver et al. (2005) and\nLommen et al. (2006) used an identical spherically symmetric model, but fitted for the electron density. They obtained\nne (1AU) = 5\u00b14 cm\u22123 and ne (1AU) = 6.9\u00b12.1 cm\u22123 respectively. However, it is not possible for a spherically symmetric\nmodel to correct the average timing residual due to the large\ndifference in density between the fast and slow winds. This\nis clearly demonstrated by our PSR J1022+1001 observations. The left panel in Figure 5 shows the DM variations of\nthis pulsar without correcting for the solar wind and gives\nthe correction from the tempo2 model as a dashed line.\nThe right panel shows the DM variations after correction\nusing the tempo2 model. During the year 2004, the tempo2\nmodel did accurately correct the effect. The original tempo\nmodel which uses a larger electron density overcorrects these\nobservations. The opposite occurs during 2005, when the\ntempo2 model under-corrects the observations whereas the\noriginal tempo models the solar wind well.\n\n\fDM Variations and Pulsar Timing\nIt is possible to use coronal measurements to improve\nour correction by estimating which parts of the line of sight\nare in the fast and which in the slow wind. This can be\ndemonstrated with our PSR J1022+1001 data, but it is not\nyet clear whether using an updated model to correct the\nobservations improves on simply measuring the excess DM\nusing multi-frequency observations. This work will be reported in a future publication.\n\n5.3\n\nSpectrum of the ISM\n\nAll but six pulsars are consistent with a Kolmogorov fluctuation spectrum with an inner time-scale smaller than \u03c4d . The\nclearest examples are PSRs J0437\u22124715 and J1939+2134.\nThe structure function for PSR J0437\u22124715 lies slightly\nabove the upper bound of the Kolmogorov model fit to the\n\u03c4d data. However, if the \u03c4d data were divided by a factor of\n1.35 they would be consistent. A line with this shift is shown\nin Figure 3a through the \u03c4d data. Given the large scatter in\n\u03c4d we consider that there is no evidence for an inner scale,\nnor do we see a need to rescale D\u03c6 (\u03c4d ) as did Smirnova et\nal. (2006). The structure function at the largest time-scales\nis currently consistent with a Kolmogorov process, but there\nis an indication that the structure function may be flattening at these scales, as if an outer scale around 60 AU were\npresent. We do not expect such a small outer scale, but it\nis not impossible if the turbulence has inhomogeneities of\nthis order. Such structures could be caused, for example, by\nshear instabilities or due to a large-scale damping mechanism such as ion-neutral damping. The presence or absence\nof this flattening will become clearer in a few years, as we\naccumulate more observations of this pulsar.\nThere have been several analyses of the structure function for PSR J1939+2134 (Cordes et al.\n1990; Ramachandran et al. 2006). The recent result of\nRamachandran et al. (2006) is overlaid on our structure\nfunction in Figure 4d. They fitted for the power-law\nexponent and obtained \u03b1 = 1.66 \u00b1 0.04. They also compare\ntheir DDM with a single \u03c4d measurement of 180 s. This\ncomparison suggests an inner scale of 1.3 \u00d7 109 m. Our DDM\nobservations are slightly above the Kolmogorov model fit\nto the \u03c4d observations. However, as with PSR J0437\u22124715\nthere is a large scatter in \u03c4d . A shift of 1.43, shown as a\nsolid line through the data in Figure 4d, would make the\nDDM consistent. Thus we believe that the case for an inner\ntime-scale greater than \u03c4d is weak for this pulsar.\nThe structure functions for PSRs J1045\u22124509 and\nJ1909\u22123744 both lie well above the upper bound of the Kolmogorov spectrum and require an inner scale which is much\nlarger than V \u03c4d . We can identify a break in the structure\nfunction for PSR J1045\u22124509 which suggests an inner timescale of about 12 d. The observations of PSR J1909\u22123744\ncan set a lower bound on the inner time-scale of 500 d. To\nour knowledge these are the first observations of such large\ninner scales. In order to estimate the corresponding spatial\nscales we use V \u2248 3.85\u00d7104 (\u03bdd D)1/2 /(\u03bd\u03c4d ) for a thin screen\n(Gupta et al. 1994). In both cases the inner scales of 0.7 and\n20 AU are comparable to or larger than the refractive scales\n\n11\n\nof 0.38 and 0.19 AU respectively 5 . These scales are so large\nthat they can only be compared with ion-neutral damping\nscales. Ion-cyclotron damping at such scales would require\nabsurdly low densities (see Equation 8).\nMeasurements\nof\nthe\nstructure\nfunction\nfor PSR J1824\u22122452 have been published by\nCognard & Lestrade (1997) and shown to be consistent with a Kolmogorov process. In Figure 4b we overlay\nthe earlier structure function (dotted line) with our results.\nThe two analyses are consistent. Our \u03c4d estimates suggest\nthat \u03c4i > \u03c4d , but because there are few measurements of \u03c4d\nand the inferred \u03c4i is not as a large as for PSRs J1045\u22124509\nand J1909\u22123744, the evidence for a large inner scale is\nweak.\nIn analysing the structure functions we have assumed\nthat the line-of-sight velocity is constant. However the true\nvelocity is a vector sum, weighted by the distance of the\nscattering plasma, of the pulsar proper motion, the orbital\nvelocity for binary pulsars, the velocity of the plasma with\nrespect to the local standard of rest and the orbital velocity\nof the earth (Rickett et al. 2000). For many of our pulsars\nthese effects are important. Thirteen of our pulsars are in\nbinary systems, and in five of those the orbital velocity is\ncomparable with the proper motion. In all five of these plus\nanother four non-binary pulsars the Earth's orbital velocity\nis also comparable. For these pulsars the magnitude and\ndirection of the velocity can change significantly, both on a\ntime-scale of days, and annually.\nDiffractive observations are made on a time-scale which\nis short compared to the orbital periods, so such observations\nare affected by the instantaneous vector sum of velocities.\nDM variations are normally averaged over times longer than\nthe typical binary periods in our sample, but shorter than a\nyear. Thus these measurements are not affected by the binary orbital velocity. On average the diffractive observations\nsee a higher velocity than the DM observations which will\nlead to the temporal structure function being flatter than\nthe spatial structure function. If the turbulence in the interstellar plasma is anisotropic, and there is increasing evidence\nthat such anisotropy is common, then the apparent diffractive time-scale will depend strongly on the direction of the\nvelocity.\nThe net effect on our estimation of the structure\nfunction of DM is not large, because four of our five\nbest constrained observations have relatively small velocity modulation. However, observations of the solitary pulsar PSR J1939+2134 are strongly modulated by the Earth's\norbital velocity. In this case both diffractive and DM observations see the same time-varying velocity so the slope\nof the structure function is not altered, but both observations will be \"noisier\" than expected. In fact, the DDM (\u03c4 )\nfor this pulsar is noisier than expected, suggesting that we\nare seeing the effect of annual variations in velocity. This\neffect is largest in PSR J2145\u22120750, for which the proper\nmotion and orbital velocity are both similar to the Earth's\norbital velocity. This pulsar shows a wider spread in \u03c4d than\nmost. The structure function for this pulsar is white-noise\ndominated, making it difficult to estimate its slope of the\n\n5\n\nThe refractive time-scales are found using tr \u2248 2\u03bd/\u03bdd \u03c4d\n(Rickett 1990)\n\n\f12\n\nX.

The expected velocity modulation makes\nit even more difficult, so even though the structure function\nappears to be Kolmogorov on the basis of a single dDM/dt\nvalue, more observations are required to confirm this.\nIn PSRs J1045\u22124509 and J1909\u22123744 we observe intensity variations at the diffractive time-scale. However if the\ninner scales were greater than the refractive scales as they\nappear to be, then the structure function is quadratic and no\nintensity scintillation should be observed6 (Wandzura 1980).\nThus there must be an underlying Kolmogorov process\nwhich is roughly equal in amplitude to the steep-spectrum\nprocess at \u03c4d .\nThis situation has been proposed theoretically (Zweibel,\nprivate communication 2006). It can arise when the primary\nenergy input to the turbulence is at scales larger than the\nion-neutral damping scale. Energy will cascade down to the\nion-neutral scale where most of it will be absorbed. However\nsome energy may 'tunnel' through the damping region to\nsupport a second Kolmogorov cascade at a lower level (in\nthe vicinity of the ion-neutral collision frequency, plasma\nwaves are evanescent).\nIn the case of PSR J1045\u22124509 the energy difference\nis about a factor of 30. For PSR J1909\u22123744 we can only\nsay that the energy difference is at least a factor of 30. This\nis a very intriguing possibility which requires both observational and theoretical followup. The existence of steep spectra might be confirmed by VLBI observations which should\nshow an rms position wander of \u03bb/(2\u03c0V \u03c4d ) on a time-scale of\nthe inner time-scale (where \u03bb is the wavelength). The baselines needed for a 1 rad rms phase difference are V \u03c4d , where\n\u03c4d scales as \u03bd 1.2 . This is about 8000 km for PSR J1045\u22124509\nand 6000 km for PSR J1824\u22122452 at 1400 MHz. It would\nbe much more difficult to measure PSR J1909\u22123744 as the\nbaseline, even at 327 MHz, would be 50000 km and the timescale for position wander would be greater than 500 d.\n\n5.4\n\nWhite noise\n\nTwelve of our pulsars show a well-defined flattening of the\nstructure functions at small lags which indicates the presence of a white-noise process that is substantially greater\nthan the measurement error. Although this has not been\ndiscussed in the context of DM measurements before, it is a\nwell-known anomaly in TOA measurements. Observers have\noften rescaled their measurement error estimates to match\nthis white noise, but it is not clear that the additional white\nnoise is due to measurement error. It could be due to a\nprocess intrinsic to the pulsar, unexplained calibration issues, or to diffractive TOA noise. The latter process will\nhave the same time scale as diffractive intensity scintillation and is highly correlated with the intensity scintillation. Its rms is of the order of \u03c40 = 1/(2\u03c0\u03bdd ). Although\nthis phenomena has not been well-studied, it has been observed directly (Lestrade et al. 1998) and discussed theoretically (Romani et al. 1986). We have compared the observed\nwhite noise rms with \u03c40 for each pulsar and find that this\nmechanism will need to be considered for four of the PPTA\n6\n\nA pure quadratic structure function corresponds to a linear\nphase gradient, which simply shifts the apparent position of the\nsource and does not change the intensity.\n\npulsars: PSRs J1045\u22124509, J1600\u22123053, J1643\u22121224 and\nJ1939+2134. Since this mechanism is correlated with intensity it may be possible to use intensity measurements to\ncorrect it. It is likely that most of the white noise is related\nto system calibration errors as it is known, at least for some\npulsars, to depend on the observing frequency and backend\ninstruments.\n\n6\n\nCORRECTION OF RESIDUALS FOR DM\nVARIATIONS\n\nDuring the design of the PPTA project it was realised that\nDM variations would be an important source of timing noise\nand, unless corrected, would obscure the signature of many\ninteresting phenomena such as gravitational waves. Initial\nexpectations were that observations using the dual-band receiver would be used to determine \u2206DM(t) which, in turn,\nwould be used to correct the 20 cm timing residuals. Of\ncourse, the measurements of DM include a white-noise component discussed earlier and hence, the correction for the\n\"red\" DM variations adds white noise. Smoothing the DM\ndata before making the correction will reduce the white noise\nmore than the DM noise. However, choosing the optimal\nsmoothing is non-trivial.\nThe problem is that the timing model includes numerous terms such as parallax, position, proper motion, period\nand period derivative that absorb some of the residuals due\nto DM variations. Fitting the timing model to the residuals can substantially reduce the effect of DM variations, but\ncauses significant errors in the fitted parameters. We cannot\nuse the post-fit rms timing residual as a goodness measure,\nsince it would not change at all after correction if the DM\neffect has been totally absorbed in the fitted parameters.\nAccordingly we have calculated the optimal smoothing factor using a simple analytical model which requires equally\nspaced observations. We have also simulated the observations at the actual sampling intervals with known model\nparameters and determined the optimal smoothing for the\nsimulated data without having to fit a timing model. This\nwork is outlined in Appendix C.\nAn example of the correction process is shown in\nFigure 6. We have shown the post-fit residuals for\nPSR J1939+2134 before correction (with an rms timing\nresidual of 0.291 \u03bcs), and after correction (rms of 0.193 \u03bcs).\nWe can assume that the timing model after correction is\nmuch more accurate than before correction. Therefore we\nhave plotted the residuals of the uncorrected data using\nthe more accurate corrected model resulting in an rms of\n0.941 \u03bcs. The total proper motion, pulse-frequency, and frequency derivative were changed during the correction process by 7\u03c3, 28\u03c3 and 28\u03c3 respectively.\nFigure 6 shows clearly the necessity of correction for DM\nvariations, and it also shows how fitting a timing model can\nspuriously remove a \"red\" process. For instance, if the TOA\nvariations included the signature of a gravitational wave\nwhich resembled the DM variations (both are expected to\nhave a steep, \"red\" signature) then fitting the timing model\nwould also have removed most of the gravitational wave signature. Fortunately as the duration of the timing data increases it becomes harder for the timing model to emulate\neither the DM variations or the signature of gravitational\n\n\fDM Variations and Pulsar Timing\n\n13\n\nTable 5. Improvement of timing residuals after correction for the\nDM variations.\n\nFigure 6. Timing residuals for PSR J1939+2134. The upper\npanel (a) shows the timing residuals before DM correction, panel\n(b) contains the timing residuals after correcting for the DM variations using a 71 day smoothing. Panel (c) shows the residuals\nobtained using the corrected parameters with the uncorrected\nTOAs.\n\nwaves. This is because the terms related to the motion of\nthe Earth have annual or semiannual periods so they are\nnot as effective at removing longer period variations.\nThe process described above has also been applied to\nfive other pulsars for which DM fluctuations are important.\nFor each of these pulsars, the theoretical smoothing time for\nuniformly sampled data and the actual optimal smoothing\ntime from the simulation are given in the first two columns of\nTable 5. The rms timing residuals corresponding to the three\npanels of Figure 6, \"original\", \"corrected\", and \"true uncorrected\" (where the corrected pulsar parameters are used\nto model the uncorrected TOAs), are tabulated in the last\nthree columns of the table. There is a correlation between\nthe improvement of the residuals and the slope of \u2206DM(t).\nThe pulsars with the least slope, PSRs J0437\u22124715 and\nJ1939+2134, showed the most improvement in rms after\ncorrection for the DM variations. This is because a linear\nslope can be corrected exactly, but spuriously, in the original fitting. The \u2206DM(t) values for all except the last pulsar in the table are dominated by the plasma contribution.\nThese all show significantly higher \"true uncorrected\" residuals demonstrating that the correction process was important even though it may not have significantly lowered the\nrms timing residuals. The last pulsar, PSR J1643\u22121224, is\ndominated by white noise and does not show much improvement in residual, nor is the true uncorrected residual much\nlarger. As the PPTA continues to collect more data, the DM\ncorrections will become increasingly important and will have\nto be applied to more of the observed pulsars.\n\n7\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have shown that correction for the plasma delay is essential for the purposes of the PPTA project and have developed an optimal way of applying this correction.\nWe also show that the spherically symmetric solar wind\nmodels included in the pulsar timing packages tempo and\n\nPSR Name\n\ntheory\nTsm\n(d)\n\nsimu.\nTsm\n(d)\n\n\u03c3orig\n(\u03bcs)\n\n\u03c3cor.\n(\u03bcs)\n\n\u03c3uncor.\n(\u03bcs)\n\nJ1939+2134\nJ1824\u22122452\nJ0437\u22124715\nJ1909\u22123744\nJ1045\u22124509\nJ1643\u22121224\n\n100\n54\n243\n163\n116\n281\n\n71\n51\n91\n211\n201\n361\n\n0.291\n0.937\n0.396\n0.192\n3.862\n2.770\n\n0.193\n0.883\n0.316\n0.186\n3.800\n2.732\n\n0.941\n4.111\n0.509\n0.605\n9.386\n3.200\n\ntempo2 are of marginal value.

However at least two of the 15 pulsars for which we\ncan estimate the spectral exponent require a steeper spectrum and suggest strongly that ion-neutral collisions are important in damping the turbulence spectrum at AU scales.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nX.

As described in \u00a72, we assume that\nthe errors on the \u2206DM(t) values are independent, Gaussian\nand have known, but different, standard deviations. The\nbias and error that these errors contribute to Dest (\u03c4 ) are\nobtained by expanding each Dest (\u03c4 ) as\n\nDest (\u03c4 )\n\n=\n+\n\n(\nX\n1\n[\u2206DM(i) \u2212 \u2206DM(j)]2\nNp\nij\nX\n[e(i)2 + e(j)2 ]\nij\n\n+\n\n2\n\nX\n\n[e(i) \u2212 e(j)][\u2206DM(i) \u2212 \u2206DM(j)]\n\nij\n\n\u2212\n\n2\n\nX\n\ne(i)e(j)\n\nij\n\n)\n\n,\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere Np is the number of pairs, \u2206DM(i) is the \u2206DM within\nthe time lag \"bin\" \u03c4 , and e(i) is the corresponding error.\nThe first term in this expansion is the desired estimator and\nthe other terms are uncorrelated errors. The second term is\nthe only error term that does not have zero mean and so\ncontributes a bias which must be calculated and subtracted\nfrom DDM (\u03c4 ). The variances of each term are easily calculated and summed to give the total variance in DDM (\u03c4 ). So\nfinally, the calculated DDM (\u03c4 ) is\n(\nX\n1\nDDM (\u03c4 ) =\n[\u2206DM(i) \u2212 \u2206DM(j)]2\nNp\nij\n)\nX\n2\nNi \u01eb(i)\n\u2212\n(A2)\ni\n\nwhere \u01eb(i) is the rms of the e(i), Ni is the number of times\nthat \u2206DM(i) is used to calculate the DDM (\u03c4 ).

Normally, the\nparameters of diffractive interstellar scintillation (time-scale\n\u03c4d and decorrelation frequency scale \u03bdd ) are obtained using\n\n\fDM Variations and Pulsar Timing\na two dimensional auto-correlation function (ACF) of the\ndynamic spectrum S(\u03bd, t) as\nC(\u2206\u03bd, \u2206t) =\nXX\n1\n\u2206S(\u03bd, t)\u2206S(\u03bd + \u2206\u03bd, t + \u2206t) (B1)\nNp (\u2206\u03bd, \u2206t) \u03bd t\nwhere Np is the number of pairs. \u2206S(\u03bd, t) = S(\u03bd, t)\u2212S\u0304 where\nS(\u03bd, t) is the flux density and S\u0304 is the mean flux density for\nthe whole observation. The diffractive parameters are defined by C(0, \u03c4d ) = C(0, 0)/e and C(\u03bdd , 0) = C(0, 0)/2. The\nparameters \u03c4d and \u03bdd are obtained by fitting a 2 dimensional\nGaussian to C(\u2206\u03bd, \u2206t). However we often have an observed\ndynamic spectrum which is not much longer than \u03c4d and\nwider than \u03bdd .\nWe use a method based on the structure function instead of auto-correlation function to estimate the diffractive\ntime-scale. In our data, the ACF is biased because we have\nfew scintles in the dynamic spectra. For such cases the structure function, defined as D(\u2206t) = [S(t) \u2212 S(t + \u2206t)]2 /Np ,\nis a better estimator because it does not require estimation\nof S\u0304. If C(\u2206t) exists, then D(\u2206t) = 2[C(0) \u2212 C(\u2206t)]. We\nestimate D(\u2206t) as\ne\nD(\u2206t)\n=\n\nXX\n1\n[\u2206S(\u03bd, t) \u2212 \u2206S(\u03bd, t + \u2206t)]2 . (B2)\nNp (\u2206t) \u03bd t\n\nBecause there is receiver noise which is white, the measured structure function is\nDm (\u2206t) = D(\u2206t) + Dw = 2C(0) \u2212 2C(\u2206t) + Dw (\u2206t) (B3)\n\nAfter normalisation (C(0) = 1) and according to the definition of \u03bdd (C(\u03bdd ) = C(0)/2 = 1/2), we can obtain \u03bdd when\nDs (\u2206\u03bd) = 1.\n\nAPPENDIX C: CALCULATING THE OPTIMAL\nSMOOTHING TIME\nLet tg1 and tg2 be idealised TOAs that are affected by neither noise nor DM variations. These TOAs correspond to\nfrequencies \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 respectively where \u03bd1 > \u03bd2 . Similarly,\ntg1o and tg2o are observed TOAs at these frequencies which\nhave been affected by noise and DM variations. So the observed TOAs are given by\ntgio = tgi + ni (t) +\n\n=\n\n2\u03c3 2 (\u2206t > 0)\n\n=\n\n0(\u2206t = 0)\n\ng\nDM(t)\n\nDm (\u2206t) = 2[1 \u2212 exp(\u2212(\u2206t/\u03c4d )5/3 )] + Dw (\u2206t)\n\n=\n\n[tg2o (t) \u2212 tg1o (t)]\n\n=\n\n(tg2 \u2212 tg1 )\n\nThep\nuncertainty \u03c3Dm (\u2206t) is estimated as \u03c3Dm (\u2206t) =\nDm (\u2206t) \u2206t/To , where To is the observation time. We\nchoose the equal log time interval points to fit because when\n\u2206t is large, the points are not independent. Then we can fit\nthe parameters \u03c4d and Dw in Equation B5 to obtain the\ndiffractive time-scale \u03c4d .\nA similar analysis can be used to obtain the diffractive\nbandwidth, \u03bdd . However, in contrast to the determination\nof \u03c4d , we do not know the form of C(\u2206\u03bd) and, hence, it is\nnot possible to fit for \u03bdd and Dw (\u2206\u03bd). However, Dw (\u2206\u03bd) =\n2\u03c3 2 \u2248 Dm (\u2206\u03bdm ), where \u2206\u03bdm is the minimum frequency lag\n(in our data, it is typically 0.5 MHz). Dw (\u2206\u03bd) is the bias\nterm which must be subtracted. This leads to the structure\nfunction being,\nDs (\u2206\u03bd) = Dm (\u2206\u03bd) \u2212 Dm (\u2206\u03bdm ) = 2C(0) \u2212 2C(\u2206\u03bd).

For our\nobservations, the diffractive scintillation is strong and the\nobserving time is much less than the refractive time-scale,\nso C(0) = 1. From the Kolmogorov spectrum, C(\u2206t) =\nexp(\u2212(\u2206t/\u03c4d )5/3 ).\nSo finally we can write the measured structure function\nas\n\n\u2206DM(t) \u22122\n\u03bdi\nK\n\nwhere ni (t) is the noise at \u03bdi which is assumed to be white\n(i = 1, 2 for the two observations respectively). The measured estimate of DM(t) is therefore given by\n\nwhere Dw is the structure function for the white noise.\nDw (\u2206t)\n\n15\n\ng\nDM(t)\n\u03bd1\u22122\nK\ntg1 a1 \u2212 tg2 a2 + n1 (t)a1 \u2212 n2 (t)a2\n\ntg1o (t) \u2212\n\n\u03bd2\u22122 /(\u03bd2\u22122\n\n(C3)\n\nwhere a1 =\n\u2212\nand a2 =\n\u2212 \u03bd1\u22122 ).\nNote that, since a1 \u2212 a2 = 1, contributions to the timing residuals which are frequency independent and thus the\nsame in tg1 and tg2 , appear unchanged in tg1c . This is an\nimportant property of the correction algorithm because interesting contributions such as the signature of gravitational\nwaves, planets orbiting the pulsar, or ephemeris errors are\nunaltered by the correction.\nComparing Equations C1 and C3 we see that the vari2\n2\nance of the white noise has increased from \u03c3N1\nto \u03c3N1\na21 +\n2\n2\n\u03c3N2 a2 although the DM noise has been eliminated. We can\ng\nimprove the variance in tg1c by smoothing DM(t)\nbefore subtracting it from tg1o , because smoothing reduces the white\nnoise more than the DM(t) variations. The white variance\ng\nin DM(t)\nis reduced by the smoothing number Ns . It is\nhard to calculate the effect of smoothing DM(t) analytically,\nbut we found numerically that the variance of equally sampled [DM(t)\u2212smoothed(DM(t))] \u2248 0.5DDM (Tsm /2\u03c0) where\nTsm = (Ns \u2212 1)\u03c40 and \u03c40 is the sampling time (typically\ng\n15 d). However, the white noise in the smoothed DM(t)\nis\npartially correlated with that in tg1o , so we have finally the\nvariance in tg1c\n2\n\u03c31csm\n\n=\n\n\u03bd1\u22122 )\n\n\u03bd1\u22122 /(\u03bd2\u22122\n\n2\n2\n(\u03c3 2 + \u03c3N2\n)a22\n2a2 \u03c3N1\n2\n\u03c3N1\n+ N1\n+\nNs\nNs\n\u00ab2 \u201e\n\u201e\n\u00ab\u03b1\nNs \u2212 1\n1\n1\nDDM (\u03c40 ).\n+\n2 k\u03bd12\n2\u03c0\n\n(C4)\n\n\f16\n\nX. P. You et al.\n\nWe minimise this numerically. In fact, the data are not\nequally sampled so we first interpolate the raw data on to\nan equally spaced array before smoothing. To check the effect of re-sampling we compared the theory above with a\nsimulation. We realised 50 samples of DM(t) from a population matching DM(\u03c4 ) with the actual data sampling. Then\nwe interpolated the simulated data onto an equally spaced\narray and found the Ns which best corrected for DM(t). In\nall cases the minimum is very broad so it makes little difference whether one uses the theoretical or simulated value\nof Ns . However, the simulation is easy to implement and\nwill be correct even in the case of an unusual distribution of\nsamples.\n\nAPPENDIX D: AVAILABLE SOFTWARE\nThe tempo2 software was designed to allow for easy\naddition of new features and functionality in the form\nof plug-ins to the main package. During this work\nwe have produced the following new plug-in packages\nwhich are now available as part of the tempo2 distribution (full details are available from our web-site,\nhttp://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/tempo2):\n\u2022 calcDM: this plug-in contains the algorithms described in this paper.
