We find also that when the cavity entanglement suddenly disappear, the reservoir entanglement suddenly and necessarily appears. Surprisingly, we show that this entanglement sudden\nbirth can manifest before, simultaneously, or even after entanglement sudden death. Finally, we\npresent an explanatory study of other entanglement partitions and of higher dimensional systems.\nPACS numbers: 03.65.Yz, 03.65.Ud, 03.67.Mn\n\nDynamical behavior of entanglement under the action\nof the environment is a central issue in quantum information [1, 2, 3, 4]. Recently, it has been observed that two\nqubits affected by uncorrelated reservoirs can experience\ndisentanglement in a finite time despite coherence is lost\nasymptotically [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. This phenomenon, called\nentanglement sudden death (ESD), has recently deserved\na great attention [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], and has been\nobserved in the lab for entangled photon pairs [14], and\natomic ensembles [15].\nTo our knowledge ESD has been studied mainly in relation to bipartite systems, while a deeper understanding is associated to the question of where does the lost\nentanglement finally go. This question would be properly answered by enlarging the system to include reservoir degrees of freedom. Intuitively, we may think that\nthe lost entanglement has to be transferred to the reservoir degrees of freedom. However, is this entanglement\nswapped continuously? If the bipartite entanglement suffers ESD, what can we say about the transferred entanglement? Should there be a simultaneous entanglement\nsudden birth (ESB) on reservoir states, or when would\nthis entanglement be created? In this work, we thoroughly study the entanglement transfer from the bipartite system to their independent reservoirs. We show\nthat ESD of a bipartite system state is intimately linked\nto ESB of entanglement between the reservoirs, though\ntheir apparition times follow counterintuitive rules.\nTo illustrate the problem we have chosen the case of\nentangled cavity photons being affected by dissipation, as\nin the case of two modes inside the same dissipative cavity\nor single modes in two different ones. The present study\ncould certainly be extended to other physical systems\nlike matter qubits. First we study the case of qubits for\ntwo uncoupled (cavity) modes having up to one photon.\nThen, we extend our treatment to investigate wether or\nnot the effect is present in higher dimensions (qudits).\nSince each mode evolves independently, we can learn\nhow to characterize the evolution of the overall system\n\nfrom the mode-reservoir dynamics. The interaction between a single cavity mode and an N -mode reservoir is\ndescribed through the Hamiltonian\n\u0124 = ~\u03c9\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + ~\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c9k b\u0302\u2020 b\u0302 + ~\n\nN\nX\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\ngk \u00e2b\u0302\u2020k + b\u0302k \u00e2\u2020 . (1)\n\nLet us consider the case when a cavity mode is containing\na single photon and its corresponding reservoir is in the\nvacuum state,\n|\u03c60 i = |1ic \u2297 |0\u0304ir ,\n\n(2)\n\nQN\n\nwhere, |0\u0304ir = k=1 |0k ir . It is not difficult to realize that\nthe evolution given by (1) leads to the state\n|\u03c6t icr = \u03be(t)|1ic |0\u0304ir +\n\nN\nX\n\nk=1\n\n\u03bbk (t)|0ic |1k ir ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the state |1k ir accounts for the reservoir having\none photon in mode k. The amplitude \u03be(t) converges to\n\u03be(t) = exp (\u2212\u03bat/2) in the limit of N \u2192 \u221e for a reservoir\nwith a flat spectrum. The right-hand term of the last\nequation can be rewritten in terms of a collective state\nof the reservoir modes as\n|\u03c6t i = \u03be(t)|1ic |0\u0304ir + \u03c7(t)|0ic |1\u0304ir .\n\n(4)\n\nHere, we defined the normalized collective state with one\nexcitation in the reservoir as\nN\n\n|1\u0304ir =\n\n1 X\n\u03bbk (t)|1k ir ,\n\u03c7(t)\n\n(5)\n\nk=1\n\nand the amplitude \u03c7(t) in Eq. (4) converge to the expression \u03c7(t) = (1 \u2212 exp (\u2212\u03bat))1/2 in the large N limit.\nDescribed in this way the cavity and reservoir evolve as\nan effective two-qubit system [16].\nLet us now study the joint evolution of two qubits with\ntheir corresponding reservoirs initially in the global state\n|\u03a60 i = (\u03b1|0ic1 |0ic2 + \u03b2|1ic1 |1ic2 )|0\u0304ir1 |0\u0304ir2 .\n\n(6)\n\n\f2\nAccording to Eq.(4), the evolution of the overall system\nwill be given by\n\n1.0\n0.9\n0.8\n\nWe observe that the overall state evolves as a four-qubit\nsystem. By tracing out the reservoir states, the reduced\ntwo-cavity reduced density matrix reads\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb 2\n\u03b1 + \u03b2 2 \u03c74\n0\n0\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03be 2\n\uf8ec\n0\n\u03b2 2 \u03be 2 \u03c72\n0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7 .

On the other hand,\nwhen tracing out cavity modes we are led to the reduced\nreservoir state\n\uf8eb 2\n\uf8f6\n\u03b1 + \u03b22 \u03be4\n0\n0\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03c72\n\uf8ec\n0\n\u03b2 2 \u03c72 \u03be 2\n0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7 , (9)\n\u03c1r1 r2 = \uf8ec\n2 2 2\n\uf8ed\n0\n0\n\u03b2 \u03be \u03c7\n0 \uf8f8\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03c72\n0\n0\n\u03b2 2 \u03c74\n\nwhose structure also corresponds to an X state. When\nreplacing \u03be(t) \u2194 \u03c7(t), this state is complementary to the\nstate in Eq. (8). If \u03c1c1 c2 is exhibiting ESD, what happens\nthen with \u03c1r1 r2 ? To answer this question we calculate the\nconcurrence [17] for \u03c1c1 c2 , which for the particular state\nis given by the simple expression\nC(t) = max{0, \u22122\u03bb},\n\n(10)\n\nwith \u03bb being the negative eigenvalue of the density matrix\npartial transpose. For reduced states \u03c1c1 c2 and \u03c1r1 r2 these\nnegative eigenvalues are given by\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(11)\n\u03bbc1 c2 = e\u2212\u03bat \u03b2 2 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bat ) \u2212 |\u03b1\u03b2| ,\n\u03bbr1 r2 = (1 \u2212 e\n\n\u2212\u03bat\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n) \u03b2 2 e\u2212\u03bat \u2212 |\u03b1\u03b2| .\n\n(12)\n\nFigure 1 shows the evolution of concurrence between the\ntwo cavities (solid line) and the two reservoirs (dashed\nline). Despite the entanglement between the two cavities suddenly disappears, sudden birth of entanglement\narises between the two reservoirs. Note that the entanglement contained initially in the cavity-cavity subsystem is\ntransferred to the bipartite reservoir system. The time\nfor which ESD and the entanglement sudden birth (ESB)\noccur can be calculated from Eqs. (11) and (12), looking\nfor the time where \u03bbc1 c2 becomes positive for ESD and\nthe time for which \u03bbr1 r2 becomes negative for ESB,\n\u0011\n\u0010\ntESD = \u2212 \u03ba1 ln 1 \u2212 \u03b1\n\u03b2 ,\ntESB =\n\n1\n\u03ba\n\nln\n\n\u03b2\n\u03b1.\n\n(13)\n\nConcurrence\n\n0.7\n\n(7)\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\u03bat\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFIG. 1: Evolution of two-qubit concurrence Cc1 c2 (solid line)\nand Cr1\u221a\nr2 (dashed line),\n\u221a for the initial state of Eq.

(6) with\n\u03b1 = 1/ 10 and \u03b2 = 3/ 10.\n\nFrom these expressions we learn that ESB occurs for\n\u03b2 > \u03b1, as is the case for ESD. In other words, the presence of ESD implies necessarily the apparition of ESB\nand, consequently, asymptotic decay of entanglement between cavities implies an asymptotic birth and growing\nof entanglement between reservoirs.\nFor the situation in Fig. 1 we have tESB < tESD . However, as can be easily seen from Eqs. (13), when \u03b2 = 2\u03b1,\ntESB = tESD , that is, ESB and ESD happen simultaneously. Furthermore, when \u03b2 > 2\u03b1, ESB occurs after\nESD. Although this is clear from Eqs. (13), it is not necessarily intuitive. In fact, this condition yields a time\nwindow where neither the cavity-cavity nor the reservoirreservoir subsystems have entanglement.\nTo have an idea of how the entanglement is shared\namong the parties, we study the entanglement present\nin different partitions. We start considering all bipartite\npartitions of two qubits, namely: c1 \u2297 c2 , r1 \u2297 r2 , c1 \u2297 r1\nand c1 \u2297r2 , as shown in Fig. 2.

(6) with \u03b1 = 1/ 10 and \u03b2 = 3/ 10.\n\nc1 \u2297 r1 , the entanglement is given by\np\nCc1 r1 (t) = 2\u03b2 2 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bat )e\u2212\u03bat .\n\n(14)\n\nIn the region where there is no entanglement, that is,\nCc1 c2 = Cr1 r2 = 0, entanglement between a cavity and\nits corresponding reservoir Cc1 r1 (t) reaches its maximum\nvalue. This fact is independent of the initial probability\namplitudes \u03b1 and \u03b2 and occurs for a time t = \u03ba\u22121 ln (2)\nwhich corresponds also to the time when tESD = tESB .\nEntanglement of other bipartite partitions is shown in\nFig. 3(b)-(f), and the multipartite entanglement between\nthe four effective qubits in Fig. 3(a). Such entanglement\nis described by the multipartite concurrence CN [18]. For\npartitions (b)-(f) the entanglement is obtained through\nthe square root of the tangle [19] which in the pure twoqubit case coincides with the concurrence. Note that CN\nhas the same value at t = 0 and t \u2192 \u221e, showing complete\nentanglement transfer from cavities to reservoirs.\nAlthough entanglement transfer from cavities to reservoirs is mediated only by the interaction of each cavity and its corresponding reservoir, entanglement may\nalso flow through other parties. Figure 3(b) shows that\nthe partition (c1 \u2297 r1 ) \u2297 (c2 \u2297 r2 ) has constant entanglement. However, Fig. 2 shows that entanglement in the\ntwo-qubit partition c1 \u2297 r2 is created along the evolution,\nimplying that entanglement flows also to the noninteracting partitions. This fact can be visualized as follows:\ninitially the entanglement is contained in the partition\nc1 \u2297c2 . Then, due to the interaction between cavities and\nreservoirs, for example c1 and r1 , the information about\nthe quantum state of c1 begins to be mapped into the\nquantum state of r1 . Therefore, some of the quantum information contained in the joint-system of the cavities [5]\nis now present in the joint-system of c2 \u2297 r1 , producing\nentanglement in this partition.\n\nIt is interesting to investigate whether the features we\nhave analyzed so far are present for higher dimensional\nsystems. For example, we consider the case of qutrit cavity states. Following similar steps used to obtain Eq. (4),\nit is not difficult to calculate the evolution of a single\ncavity mode, initially in a two-photon |2ic state, interacting with the reservoir initially in the vacuum state.\n(2)\nThe initial state |\u03c60 i = |2i \u2297 |0\u0304i evolves according with\n\u221a\n(2)\n|\u03c6t i = \u03be 2 (t)|2ic |0\u0304ir + 2\u03be(t)\u03c7(t)|1ic |1\u0304ir + \u03b8(t)|0ic |2\u0304ir ,\n(15)\nwhere,\n\u0012X\nN\n1\n|\u03bbk (t)|2 |2k i\n(16)\n|2\u0304ir =\n\u03b8(t)\nk=1\n\u0013\nN\n\u221a X\n+ 2\n\u03bbk (t)\u03bbq (t)|1k . . . 1q ir ,\nk6=q=1\n\np\nand \u03b8(t) = 1 \u2212 \u03be 4 (t) \u2212 2\u03be 2 (t)\u03c72 (t). We can now study\nthe entanglement when the initial state is given by\n|\u03a60 i = (\u03b1|0ic1 |0ic2 + \u03b2|1ic1 |1ic2 + \u03b3|2ic1 |2ic2 )\u2297|0\u0304ir1 |0\u0304ir2 .\n(17)\nAs no entanglement monotone exists for an arbitrary\nhigher dimensional state, we focus on the analytical expression for a lower bound of entanglement (LBOE)\nfound by Chen, et. al. [20], based on the PPT [21, 22]\nand realignment criterion [23, 24]. The LBOE monotone\nof a bipartite system (A \u0001and B) denoted \u039b is given by\n\u039b = max \u03c1TA , kR(\u03c1)k , where the trace norm k*k is\n1\ndefined as kGk = tr(GG\u2020 ) 2 . The matrix \u03c1TA is the partial transpose with respect to the subsystem A, that is,\nA\n\u03c1Tik,jl\n= \u03c1jk,il , and the matrix R(\u03c1) is realignment matrix\ndefined as R(\u03c1)ij,kl = \u03c1ik,jl . The values of \u039b ranges from\n1 (separable state) to d (maximally entangled), where d\nis the dimension of the lower dimensional subsystem.\nIn Fig. (4), the evolution of \u039bc1 c2 (t) and \u039br1 r2 (t) is\nshown. We observe that the sudden death of the cavitycavity entanglement is accompanied by sudden birth of\nreservoir-reservoir entanglement as in the two-qubit case.\nMoreover, the LBOE dynamics between the reservoirs exhibits abrupt changes as the LBOE between cavities [13].\nThe times for the ESD and the ESB to appear are\n\u0012 \u0013 12 !\n1\n\u03b1\nc1 c2\n,\n(18)\ntESD = \u2212 ln 1 \u2212\n\u03ba\n\u03b3\n1\n\u03b3\nln .\n(19)\n2\u03ba \u03b1\nAs for the two-qubit case, the time for wich ESD and\nESB occur simultaneously results to be t = \u03ba\u22121 ln (2).\nIn general, for a d \u2297 d-dimensional bipartite system,\neach one coupled to an independent reservoir, and initially prepared in a state of the form\nr1 r2\ntESB\n=\n\n|\u03a80 i =\n\nd\nX\n\nk=0\n\n\u03b1k |kic1 |kic2 \u2297 |0\u0304ir1 |0\u0304ir2 ,\n\n(20)\n\n\f4\nhow the entanglement flows to other partitions. Finally,\nwe showed that the simultaneous occurrence of ESD and\nESB is independent of the system dimension.\n\n2.8\n2.6\n2.4\n\n\u039b(t)\n\n2.2\n\nC.E.L. acknowledges financial support from Fondecyt 11070244, DICYT USACH and PBCT-CONICYT\nPSD54, F.L. from Fondecyt 3085030, G.R. from CONICYT grants, J.C.R. from Fondecyt 1070157 and Milenio\nICM P06-067, E.S. from SFB 631, EU EuroSQIP, and\nIkerbasque Foundation.\n\n2.0\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\u03bat\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFIG. 4: Evolution of two-qutrit LBOE for different partitions:\n\u039bc1 c2 (solid line), \u039br1 r2 (dashed line), \u039bc1 r1 (dot-dashed line),\nfor the initial state\n\u039bc\u221a\n1 r2 (dotted line),\u221a\n\u221a of Eq.

As can be seen from Fig. 5 the time for which\ntESD = tESD = \u03ba\u22121 ln (2). The necessary condition for\nthese times to be equal is \u03b1d /\u03b10 = 2d\u22121 . Although this\ncondition does not depend on the remaining probability\namplitudes \u03b1k with k 6= 0, d, the condition \u03b1k < \u03b1d must\nbe satisfied to ensure the presence of ESD and ESB.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that ESD in a bipartite\nsystem independently coupled to two reservoirs is necessarily related to the ESB between the environments.\nThe loss of entanglement is related to the birth of entanglement between the reservoirs and other partitions.\nWe analytically demonstrate that ESD and ESB occur at\ntimes depending on the amplitudes of the initial entangled state. We found that ESB occur before, together,\nor even after ESD. In the latter case, when neither cavities nor reservoirs have entanglement, we have analyzed\n\n[1] T. S. Cubitt, F. Verstraete, W.
