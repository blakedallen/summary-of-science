The energy stored in the gauge\nfield in the presence of a distant static QQ\u0304 pair grows linearly with their separation R\n(see e.g. [2, 3] for recent data) in the pure SU(N ) theory, suggesting that the flux-lines\nrunning between the two color charges behave like a string with a string tension \u03c3.\nFrom this hypothesis, it follows in a natural way that the leading correction to the\nlinear potential corresponds to Gaussian quantum fluctuations of the string around its\nclassical configuration [8], and leads to a regularly spaced low-energy string spectrum\nwith a gap of \u03c0/R. This has been verified numerically with remarkable accuracy [4, 9,\n10, 11].\nAn elegant way to connect the string-theory predictions with a (gauge-invariant)\nobservable of the gauge theory is to consider the free energy of the QQ\u0304 pair when\ninserted inside a thermal heatbath with time extent T . The latter observable is then the\nPolyakov loop correlator [2, 6] P \u2217 (x) P (y), and a systematic expansion in (\u03c3RT )\u22121 for\nits expectation value beyond the area law was proposed in [5]. The free-string partition\nfunction reads [4, 5, 14] (in the notation of [5], except for \u1ebcn \u2192 M\u0303n )\nZ0 (T, r) = e\u2212\u03c3RT \u2212\u03bcT \u03b7(q)2\u2212d ,\nwhere\n1\n\n\u03b7(q) = q 24\n\n\u221e\nY\n\nq \u2261 e\u2212\u03c0T /r\n\n(1 \u2212 q n ).\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nn=1\n\nDue to the latter function's modular transformation property, Z0 can be expanded either\nin terms of eigenstates of the open-string or the closed-string sector [5],\nZ0 (T, r) =\n= e\u2212\u03bcT\n\nP\u221e\n\nn=0\n\n\u0012\n\nT\n2r\n\n\u0013 1 (d\u22122)\n2\n\nwith\n\nP\u221e\n\nn=0\n\n0\n\nwn e\u2212En T\n\n\u03c0 d\u22122\n(\u2212\n+ n)\nr\n24\n4\u03c0 d \u2212 2\nM\u0303n0 (T ) = \u03c3T +\n(\u2212\n+ n)\nT\n24\nEn0 (r) = \u03bc + \u03c3r +\n\n0\n\nwn e\u2212M\u0303n r .\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nthe energies of the open and closed string states respectively. The low-lying closed-string\nspectrum has also been investigated recently [12, 13]. The next order of the expansion\nwill be discussed below.\nThe idea of a derivative expansion in the transverse fluctuations was already present\nin [8]. The work of Polchinski and Strominger [16] was the first to aim at making predictions beyond the universal 1/r corrections. It has the merit of being manifestly Poincar\u00e9\ninvariant, and to give the possibility of an insight into how the worldsheet degrees of\nfreedom are related to those of the underlying quantum field theory. The more recent\napproach of L\u00fcscher and Weisz [5] has the nice feature that once the two-dimensional\n1\n\n\ffield theory has been postulated and the degrees of freedom identified, the most general interactions, including boundary operators, can be written down automatically. It\nseems that the Polchinski-Strominger prescription of plugging the induced metric into\nthe Polyakov determinant fixes the coefficient of the 1/r 3 energy corrections, whereas (in\nd = 4) they are multiplied by an undetermined coefficient in the L\u00fcscher-Weisz effective\ntheory.\nIn this paper, we address the question whether the proposed effective theory is\nconsistent with Poincar\u00e9 invariance. Indeed, string theories such as the Nambu-Goto\nstring can be formulated in a form where the latter symmetry is manifest. In an effective\nstring theory the symmetry is in general not manifest. We will however show that to any\nfinite order in the string expansion all closed string states admit a relativistic dispersion\nrelation, E2 (p) = M 2 + p2 (this property cannot be discussed for the open-string states\nbecause they are attached to static charges). The proof is simple and does not rely on\nthe details of the effective theory, but only on the rotation symmetry of infinite space\naround the worldline of a static quark, and the requirement that open-closed string\nduality holds order by order in an expansion in powers of 1/distance.\nSection 2 describes the setup and gives the proof to the statement made. Section\n3 and 4 contain the explicit calculation of the closed-string dispersion relation and\nPolyakov loop matrix element between the vacuum and the energy eigenstates in the\nL\u00fcscher-Weisz theory, at leading and at the next order respectively; the constraints on\nthe theory's unknown coefficients are rederived. Section 5 generalizes the discussion to\nthe case of compact dimensions transverse to the Polyakov-loop plane. A conclusion\nsummarizes the results obtained.\n\n2\n\nFourier representation of the Polyakov loop correlator\n\nIn this section we focus on the situation where all dimensions, except possibly the one\naround which the Polyakov loops wind, are much larger than their separation. For two\nd-dimensional vectors\nx \u2261 (0, x1 , . . . , xd\u22122 , 0)\n\nand\n\ny = (0, 0, . . . , 0, r),\n\nwe have\nhP \u2217 (x) P (y)i = f (~x, r, T )\n\n(7)\n\nP (x) = Tr {U\u03bc (x)U\u03bc (x + a\u03bc\u0302) . . . U\u03bc (x + (T \u2212 a)\u03bc\u0302)}\u03bc=0 .\n\n(8)\n\nwhere ~x = (x1 , . . . , xd\u22122 ) is a (d \u2212 2)-dimensional vector and, in the lattice regularized\ngauge theory,\n\nSee figure 1. We consider the Fourier representation of f with respect to x:\nf (~x, r, T ) =\n\ndd\u22122 p~\nc(~\np, r, T ) ei~p*~x ,\n(2\u03c0)d\u22122\n\nZ\n\n(9)\n\nThe Fourier coefficients c are conversely given by\nc(~\np, r, T ) =\n=\n\nZ\n\ndd\u22122 ~x e\u2212i~p*~x f (~x, r, T ),\n1\n\nh O\u2217 (0) O(r) i.\n\nVd\u22122\n2\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\n\f111111111\n000000000\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\n111111111\n000000000\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\n1\n0\n111111111\n000000000\n1 x\n0\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n111111111\nx\n000000000\n111111111\no 111110\n00000\n1\nx=(x1,...,x d\u22122 )\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n\nx\n\nr\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\ny\n\nd\u22121\n\nFigure 1: The setup with two Polyakov loops located at x and y winding in direction\n\u03bc = 0.\nwhere generically\nO(r) \u2261\n\nZ\n\ndd\u22122 ~z ei~p*~z P (0, z1 , z2 , . . . , zd\u22122 , r)\n\n(12)\n\nand Vd\u22122 is the volume of the space parametrized by x1 , . . . , xd\u22122 . These coefficients\nthus represent correlation functions of Polyakov loops with a definite momentum p~ along\ndirections 1 through d \u2212 2. On general grounds, the spectral representation of c(~\np, r, T )\nin the gauge theory (e.g. in terms of eigenstates of the transfer matrix of the latticeregularized gauge theory along the direction labelled by d \u2212 1) reads\nc(~\np, r, T ) =\n\nX\n\nn\u22650\n\n|vn (~\np, T )|2 e\u2212\u1ebcn (~p,T )r .\n\n(13)\n\nThus the dispersion relation of the winding flux-tube states can be read off from this\nquantity.\nThe SO(d \u2212 1) rotational symmetry around one Polyakov loop implies that the\ncorrelator is a function of a reduced number of variables:\nq\n\nf (~x, r, T ) = \u03c6( r 2 + \u03c12 , T ),\n\n\u03c1 \u2261 |~x|.\n\n(14)\n\nDue to the SO(d \u2212 2) symmetry in the dimensions 1, . . . , d \u2212 1, c obviously depends on p~\nonly through |~\np|, and so do vn and En . How the remaining SO(d\u22121)/SO(d\u22122) \u2243 SO(2)\nsymmetry is reflected in these functions is the subject of the following section.\n\n2.1\n\nBoost invariance and the two-point function of a local operator\n\nIn this section, we drop the T -dependence of c, vn and En , because it will play no\nrole. In particular, what follows applies just as well to the two-point function of QCD\n2 , \u03c8\u0304\u0393\u03c8, etc. in d \u2212 1 dimensions. Starting from Eq. 10 with f\noperators such as Tr F\u03bc\u03bd\ngiven by (14), it is easy to show that\n\u2202 \u2202\nc(p, r) = pr c(p, r)\n\u2202r \u2202p\n3\n\n(15)\n\n\fConversely, if c(~\np, r) satisfies Eq. 15, it is clear that the function f defined by Eq. 9\nsatisfies (\u03c1\u2202r \u2212 r\u2202\u03c1 )f (\u03c1, r) = 0, which implies that f is of the form (14)1 . Thus no\ninformation about the symmetry has been lost in going from (14) to (15).\nFor a function c admitting an absolutely convergent spectral representation as in\n(13), Eq. 15 is equivalent to\nX\n\nn\u22650\n\n\u2212\u1ebcn (p)r\n\ne\n\n\u0014\n\n2\n\n|vn (p)|\n\n\u0011\n2 d \u0010\nd\n2\n2\n\u1ebc\n(p)\n+\n|v\n(p)|\n\u1ebc\n(p)\n= 0,\n1\u2212\nn\nn\nn\nd(p2 )\nr d(p2 )\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\ne\u2212\u1ebc0 (p)r ,\n\nIn particular, dividing by\nthis way we learn that, for n = 0,\n\n\u0015\n\n\u2200(p, r).\n\n(16)\nand letting r \u2192 \u221e, only the n = 0 term remains. In\n\nd\n\u1ebc2 (p) = 1,\nd(p2 ) n\n\ni.e.\n\n\u1ebc2n (p) = \u1ebc2n (0) + p2 ,\n\n(17)\n\nand the momentum dependence of the matrix elements v0 is also fixed:\n|vn (p)|2 =\n\nbn\n.\n\u1ebcn (p)\n\n(18)\n\nThus the n = 0 term does not contribute to Eq. 16. One may then iterate the argument\nfor n = 1, 2, . . ., showing that Eq. 17 and 18 hold for all states. If say a double degeneracy\noccurs, one can only conclude that the sum of the |vn (p)|2 are inversely proportional\nto the common energy. However exact degeneracies normally only occur in quantum\nfield theory for symmetry reasons, in which case one also expects the |vn (p)|2 of the two\nstates to be equal.\nOne may draw two conclusions: the states that contribute to a correlator such as c\ndefined in Eq. 10 with f (~x, r) of the form (14) necessarily admit a relativistic dispersion\nrelation. Conversely, for relativistic |vn (p)|2 and \u1ebcn (p), f (~x, r) is of the form (14); which\nimplies in particular a central potential for the QQ\u0304 pair.\nIt is instructive to ask oneself which step of the argument fails to hold in the case of\na non-relativistic theory. In that case, the Euclidean time-direction plays a special role\nand cannot be interchanged for a spatial coordinate. Thus if x0 is taken to be the timedirection, then Eq. 14 holds by spatial rotation symmetry, but Eq. 13 does not hold in\ngeneral, and even if it does the \u1ebcn (p) are not the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, which\ngoverns the evolution of states in the x0 direction rather than in the xd\u22121 direction.\nAlternatively, if it is xd\u22121 that plays the role of time, then Eq. 14 does not hold (\u03c1 is\nnow a spatial and r a temporal separation), precisely because the theory does not have\nthe relativistic boost invariance.\n\n2.2\n\nBoost invariance in an effective string theory\n\nAs we shall see in the explicit calculations of sections 3 and 4, the L\u00fcscher-Weisz effective\nstring theory, worked out to order m, generically produces an expression for c(p, r) of\nthe form\n(m)\n\u221e\nX\nX\n\u03b3nk (p)\n\u2212\u1ebcn (p)r\n.\n(19)\ncm (p, r) =\ne\nrk\nn\nk=\u2212k\nm\n\n1\n\nIndeed, f is then invariant under an infinitesimal rotation (\u03c1, r) \u2192 (\u03c1 + \u03b8r, r \u2212 \u03b8\u03c1).\n\n4\n\n\fHere we assume that this correlator has been obtained by performing an integral of the\ntype (10) with f (~x, r) of the form (14).

It is not a priori obvious that the argument\nof section 2.1 goes through, since the terms of the exponential that are missing are not\nuniformly small in r. We will nevertheless show that the energy shifts preserve the\nrelativistic dispersion relation.\nIf the scheme is to be at all consistent, the energy shifts must be given by the ratio\nof the r 1 to the r 0 coefficients:\n(m)\n\n\u03b4\u1ebcn(m) (p)\n\n=\u2212\n\n\u03b3n,\u22121 (p)\n\n(22)\n\n(m)\n\n\u03b3n,0 (p)\n\nThe understanding is that the fraction should be expanded in powers of \u1ebcn (p)\u22121 and\nth power ought to be neglected. For the quadratic, cubic,\nthat the terms beyond the km\netc. terms to be consistent with the Taylor expansion of the exponential function, one\n(m)\nfinds that the numerical coefficients \u03b1nk must be related by\n(m)\n\n\u03b1n,\u2212k\n(m)\n\n\u03b1n0\nThus\n(m)\n\u03b3n,\u2212k (p)\n\n(m)\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(m)\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(m)\n\n\uf8f6k\n\n1 \u03b1n,\u22121\n= \uf8ed (m) \uf8f8 ,\nk! \u03b1\n\uf8f6k\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b1n0\n\uf8ed n,\u22121 \uf8f8\n=\n(m)\nk+1\n\u1ebcn (p) k! \u03b1n0\n\nkX\nm \u2212k\nj=0\n\nn0\n\nk \u2265 0.\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(m)\n\n(23)\n\n\uf8f6j\n\n(2j + k)! \uf8ed \u03b1n,\u22121 \uf8f8\nj!(j + k)! 2\u03b1(m) \u1ebc2 (p)\nn0\n\nn\n\n0 \u2264 k \u2264 km .

At this stage, one may consider that the series is\nactually of the form (27), where the energy levels must now be understood as the ones\nincluding the corrections (26). The analysis of the next section thus applies.\nIn summary, the type of expressions one obtains for c(p, r) from a long-distance\neffective theory for a sector of very massive states is such that the latter automatically\nadmit a relativistic dispersion relation as soon as the expression is made consistent\nwith the form expected from a spectral representation. In general these consistency\nrequirements will constrain the parameters of the effective theory. We saw that rotation\n(m)\ninvariance implies that the \u03b3n,\u2212k , 0 \u2264 k \u2264 km are parametrized in terms of (km + 1)\n(m)\n\nnumbers \u03b1n,\u2212k , 0 \u2264 k \u2264 km . The requirement of the exponentiation of these terms leads\nto km \u2212 1 conditions, so that to any order, there are exactly two free parameters per\n(m)\n(m)\nenergy level, \u03b1n0 and \u03b1n,\u22121 , which determine the overlap and energy of each state n.\nIf the effective theory can satisfy these km \u2212 1 conditions, the scheme is thus consistent\nto all orders.\n2.2.2\n\nCancelling powers of 1/r\n\nWe now suppose that the string-theory parameters have been tuned so as to give a\ndefinite-momentum correlator of the form\ncm (p, r) =\n\nX\n\n(m)\n\ne\u2212\u1ebcn\n\nn\n\n(p)r\n\n(m)\n\u221e\nX\n\u03b3nk (p)\n\nk=0\n\nrk\n\n.\n\n(27)\n\n(m)\n\nwith the \u1ebcn (p) satisfying the relativistic dispersion relation. The functional form is\nonly consistent with the spectral representation (13) if one is able to further tune the free\nparameters of the theory to cancel the terms k = 1, . . . , km , and one then neglects the\nterms with k > km . This tuning is possible for the first two orders of the L\u00fcscher-Weisz\ntheory (see [5] and the next two sections). Eq. 15 applied to the form (27) leads to Eq. 20\n(m)\nwith km = 0. As we assume \u03b3n0 (p) 6= 0, \u03b2n0 (p) = 0 requires the relativistic dispersion\n(m)\nrelation (17), and the next equation then implies (18). At k = 1, one finds that \u03b3n1 (p)\nis independent of p; note that the boost symmetry does not imply a relation between\n(m)\nthe \u03b1n,k>0 and \u03b1n,k\u22640 . Further on, it is clear that if \u03b3nk (p) = 0 for k = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1,\nthen the momentum dependence of the next coefficient is very simple:\n(m)\n\u03b3nk (p)\n\n=\n\n(m)\n\u03b3nk (0)\n\n(m)\n\n\u1ebcn (p)\nM\u0303n\n\n!k\u22121\n\n.\n\nIn particular, it vanishes identically if and only if it vanishes at p = 0.\n6\n\n(28)\n\n\fThe conclusion is that for any effective theory of f (~x, r, T ) which produces an ex(m)\npression of the type (27)\nq with \u03b3n0 (p) 6= 0, rotation symmetry automatically implies\n(m)\nthe relations \u1ebcm (p) = p2 +  \u0303(M m )2 and \u03b3 (p) \u221d (\u1ebcm (p))\u22121 and also determines the\nn\n(m)\n\u03b3nk\u22651 (p).\n\nn\n\nn\n\nn0\n\nCancelling systematically the latter in the effective\nmomentum dependence of\ntheory thus allows one to interpret \u1ebcn (p) as the energies of relativistic closed strings.\nThis can be done order by order consistently with Euclidean rotation symmetry, the\ntechnical reason being that the derivative w.r.t. and the multiplication by r in the\nidentity (15) act locally on the power series in 1/r.\n\n3\n\nThe free bosonic string theory\n\nThe effective theory (1) makes a prediction for the Polyakov loop correlator (7) for any\nseparation. In this section we exploit this fact to compute the Polyakov correlators of\ndefinite momentum explicitly, thus extracting the predicted dispersion relation for the\nclosed string states.\n4 dimensions\nSince the spatial dimensions have SO(3) as symmetry group, c0 (~\np, r, T ), the free-string\ntheory prediction for c(~\np, r, T ), can be computed straightforwardly:\nZ\n\nc0 (~\np, r, T ) = e\u2212\u03bcT\nWe obtain\n\n\u221a\nX\nT\nx|2\n\u2212M\u0303n0 r 2 +|~\nd2 ~x e\u2212i~p*~x p 2\n.\nw\ne\nn\n2 |~x| + r 2 n\u22650\n\nc0 (p, T, r) = e\u2212\u03bcT \u03c0T\nfrom which we read off\n\n1\ne\u2212r\nwn q\nn\u22650\np2 + (M\u0303n0 )2\nX\n\n\u1ebc0n (p, T ) =\n\nd=4:\n\n|vn (p, T )|2\n\np\n\np2 +(M \u0303n0 )2\n\n(29)\n\n,\n\n(30)\n\nq\n\np2 + (M\u0303n0 )2\n\u03c0T wn\n.\n= e\u2212\u03bcT q\np2 + (M\u0303n0 )2\n\n(31)\n(32)\n\nAs expected, the effective string theory predicts exactly a free, relativistic dispersion\nrelation for the closed string states.

To answer this question one may first\ninspect the v = 0 case (zero momentum). It is easy to see that, while the free theory\nterm gives a contribution O(r 0 ), the second term makes contributions O(r 0 ) and O(r +1 ),\nand the fourth one produces a whole series of inverse powers of r starting at r \u22121 . While\npositive powers of r, once exponentiated, give us the energy correction, the 1/r term is\ninconsistent with the spectral representation of c. Therefore, requiring that such terms\nbe absent yields the constraint 2c2 + c3 = 0 (already obtained in [5]).

In general, both lead to energy corrections and to terms containing\na negative power of r. The latter must be required to cancel order by order.\n\n5\n\nThe free string with one finite transverse dimension\n\nIn this section, we consider the possibility of having one dimension (say 1\u0302) transverse to\nthe plane defined by the two Polyakov loops finite and of length L. The parameter L\u22121\nmay then also be interpreted as a temperature at which the gauge theory is probed. In\nthat respect, we remark that studying the dynamics of the 'spatial' QCD string has the\nadvantage (over the ordinary electric one) that the closed strings can be kept arbitrary\nlong independently of L, while winding modes around that periodic dimension play an\nimportant role, as we shall see.\nIn [15], it was argued, using the XY model, that when L is finite but large compared\nto \u03c3 \u22121/2 , the massless fluctuations of the string are unaffected by the size of L: the\ncorrections would appear only in terms in En suppressed by a power of R greater than\n3. The string tension itself, however, becomes a function of L. Thus it is legitimate in\nthis regime to investigate the properties of the 'spatial' Polyakov loop correlator using\nthe free-string partition function.\nIt is then natural to ask what one obtains for Z0 if, working backwards, one uses\nthe expression (30) for c0 (which was derived from Z0 when L = \u221e) and sums over the\nnow discretized momenta p1 = 0, \u00b1 2\u03c0\nL , . . . (compare with Eq. 9):\nZ0 (x1 , r, T, L) = e\u2212\u03bcT \u03c0T\n\nX\n\nwn\n\nn\u22650\n\n1X\n\nL\n\neip1 x1\n\np1\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\np\n\n2\n\n2\n\n \u03030\n\n2\n\np1 +p2 +(Mn )\ndp2 e\nq\n. (57)\n2\u03c0 p + p2 + (M\u0303 0 )2\n1\nn\n2\n\u2212r\n\nUpon integrating over p2 and using Poisson's summation formula\nX\n1X\nf (p) =\nL p\nm\u2208Z\n\none then finds\nZ0 (x1 , r, T, L) =\n\nX\n\nm\u2208Z\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndp impL\ne\nf (p),\n2\u03c0\n\nq\n\nZ0 ( (mL + x1 )2 + r 2 , T ).\n\n(58)\n\nTo interpret this result, let us choose x1 = 0 and go to the open string representation\nof Z0 (r, T ). The energy eigenstates are\np\n\nEmn (r, L) = \u03bc + \u03c3(L) r 2 + m2 L2 + \u221a\n\n\u03c0\n1\n\u2212 (d \u2212 2) + n ,\n24\nr 2 + m2 L2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nn \u2265 0, m \u2208 Z\n\n(59)\nand they have weight wn for all m. In particular, the partition function (Eq. 58) is\nconsistent with open-closed string duality. Given that the direction L was taken as\nperiodic, it is clear that we have obtained a sum over classical configurations (labelled\n11\n\n\fby m) of the open string joining the two static charges along straight paths winding\nan arbitrary number of times m around the periodic dimension, with vibrational states\n(labelled by n) built up on each of these classical string configurations. The same\nresult (58) is obtained in three dimensions (starting from the asymptotic form 36). The\ndual nature of the open and closed string expansions of Z0 is manifest here, for having\nfewer momenta in the closed string channel corresponds to more states in the open\nstring channel.\nWe have however not taken into account the fact that the pure SU(N ) gauge theory\nhas a centre symmetry which is unbroken for L \u226b \u03c3 \u22121/2 and thus forbids states of\ndifferent N -ality to mix. Since the 'spatial' Polyakov loops are invariant under this\nsymmetry, the open-string states can only have winding numbers that are multiples of\nN . On the closed-string side, this would however imply that the quantum of momentum\nhas to be N2\u03c0L rather than 2\u03c0\nL . It is presently unclear to the author if the states with\na fraction of the normal unit of momentum can be given a sensible interpretation, for\ninstance as winding modes of the closed strings2 .\nFinally, we remark that the winding modes do not generate a phase transition on\nthe worldsheet. The reason is that their entropy factor is too weak. Rather we expect\nworldsheet-tearing configurations such as the vortices of the XY model to drive the\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nto 24\nphase transition [15] where the central charge of the string theory drops from 12\n\u03c0\nin d = 4 (or from 24\nto zero in d = 3). Provided the dimensionally reduced action for\nhot QCD correctly describes the asymptotic high-temperature behaviour of its magnetic\nobservables, then this phenomenon must occur at a certain L\u2217 [15]. This is currently\nbeing tested numerically [18].\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have shown explicitly that the effective string theory of L\u00fcscher and Weisz predicts a\nrelativistic dispersion relation for the closed winding flux states of SU(N ) gauge theories\nin 3 and 4 dimensions up to two-loop order included. The matrix elements of Polyakov\nloop operators between them and the vacuum were derived as a by-product. Assuming\nthe closed-string spectrum to be unchanged in the presence of a compact transverse\ndimension directly led to the existence of winding modes of the open strings around the\ncompact dimension.\nAt a more general level, we have considered a long-distance effective theory for the\nPolyakov loop correlator in SU(N ) gauge theory that imposes consistency with the\nspectral representation in the crossed channel (closed-string representation) order by\norder in the inverse Euclidean separation. We have shown that this is sufficient to\ninsure relativistic kinematics for the energy eigenstates of that channel. It is well-known\nthat bosonic string theory, as a theory valid for all distance scales, is only consistent\nwith Lorentz symmetry in 26 dimensions. Nevertheless, in a non-critical number of\ndimensions, bosonic string theory can be reconciled with space-time symmetry order\nby order in an expansion around classical, elongated string configurations, a conclusion\nalready reached in [16].\n2\n\nWhen L < 1/Tc , where Tc is the deconfining temperature of the gauge theory, the centre symmetry\nis broken, so this difficulty is absent.\n\n12\n\n\fI am very grateful to Rainer Sommer for a discussion which led to a rewriting of\nsection 2.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
