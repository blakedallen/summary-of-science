This critical exponent 3/2 proves that the QCP is controlled by the SDW QCP in three space dimensions\nstudied by the renormalization group and self-consistent renormalization theories.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nQuantum critical points (QCP) separating ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic states from paramagnetic\nFermi liquid states in strongly correlated electron systems have been investigated for decades. Successful descriptions of quantum critical behavior were provided by\nthe self-consistent renormalization (SCR) theory of spin\nfluctuations [1, 2] for d-electron systems based on the\nHubbard model. The mean-field type approximations in\nthis theory were justified by the renormalization group\nstudies [3, 4] using Hertz's effective action above upper\ncritical dimensions. For the ferromagnetic QCP, theoretical predictions were supported by experimental studies\nof d-electron systems [1]. In contrast there is little experimental understanding of the antiferromagnetic QCP\n[2].\nA recent intriguing issue of QCP under controversial\ndebate is directed toward revealing relevant fixed points\nfor antiferromagnetic QCPs in heavy-fermion systems\n[5]. For energy scales much lower than the Kondo temperature TK , f and conduction electrons form composite\nquasiparticles with a large mass renormalization in paramagnetic heavy fermions. By tuning a certain parameter, e.g., pressure or concentration, an antiferromagnetic\n\nlong range order emerges from the Fermi liquid state. In\na weak coupling picture, it has been hypothesized that\nthe same QCP as the d-electron itinerant antiferromagnet, referred to as spin density wave (SDW) type QCP, is\nrelevant to the heavy fermion QCP [6, 5].\nHowever despite a number of experimental studies of\nheavy-fermion systems showing non-Fermi liquid behavior, none of them definitively supports this QCP\n[7, 8, 9, 10]. This stems partly from experimental difficulty in measuring weakly divergent quantities around\na QCP, especially for bulk properties, which has been\nalso the case for d-electron itinerant antiferromagnets\n[2]. On the contrary, several recent experiments suggest\nthe possibility of a novel strong coupling picture of the\nQCP [5, 11, 12]. Among these studies, single-crystalline\nneutron scattering investigations of the heavy fermion\nCeCu5.9 Au0.1 provided interesting insight [11]. On the\nbasis of the observed E/T -scaling with an anomalous exponent [11], and effective two space dimensions [13], a\nscenario of a locally critical QCP was proposed [5, 14].\nIn this work, we have studied the antiferromagnetic QCP of another heavy-fermion system\nCe(Ru1\u2212x Rhx )2 Si2 (x = 0, 0.03) using single-crystalline\nneutron scattering [15]. Stoichiometric CeRu2 Si2 is an\narchetypal paramagnetic heavy-fermion with enhanced\n\n\fC/T \u2243 350 mJ/K2 mol and TK \u2243 24 K [16]. Extensive\nneutron scattering studies of CeRu2 Si2 [17] have shown\nthat spin fluctuations possessing three-dimensional\n(d = 3) character are excellently described by the SCR\ntheory for heavy fermions [6]. A small amount of Rh\ndoping, x > xc \u2243 0.04 [18], induces an antiferromagnetic phase (see the inset of Fig. 3) of the sinusoidally\nmodulated structure with the wave vector k 3 = 0.35cc\u2217\n[19]. Samples nearly tuned to the lowest concentration\nQCP (x \u223c xc ) show non-divergent C/T (T \u2192 0) [20] and\n\u2206\u03c1 \u221d T 3/2 [15], which are consistent with the SDW QCP\nin d = 3. Thus one can expect that Ce(Ru1\u2212x Rhx )2 Si2\n(x . xc ) is suited to investigate the SDW QCP without\ndisorder effects.\n\nk2\n\nk1\n\n\u2206\n\n\u03a3\n\nk2\n\nW\n\nk1\n\n\u2206\n\n\u03a3\n\nP\n\n\u0393\n\nN\n\nY\n\n(b)\n\nX\n\nU\n\n0\n\n5\n\nP\n\nk3\n\n\u039b\n\nZ\n\nW\n\n\u0393\n\nN\n\nk3\n\nF\n\nX\n\nk 1 = (0.3, 0, 0)\nk2 = (0.3, 0.3, 0)\nk3 = (0, 0, 0.35)\n\nCeRu2Si2\n\n\u039b\n\nU\n\nF\nZ\n\nIm \u03c7 (q, E) (10 -2 emu/mol Ce)\n\nE = 1 meV\n\nFIGURE 1. Observed (a) and calculated (b) intensity maps\nof constant-E scans taken with E = 1 meV at T = 1.5 K for the\nsample with x = 0 [17]. They are shown on the surface of the\nirreducible Brillouin zone.\n\nEXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSES\nNeutron-scattering measurements were performed on\nthe triple-axis spectrometer HER at JAERI. It was operated using final energies of Ef = 3.1 and 2.4 meV providing energy resolutions of 0.1 and 0.05 meV (full width\nat half maximum), respectively, at elastic positions. Single crystals with a total weight of 19 g (x = 0) and 17\ng (x = 0.03) were grown by the Czochralski method.\nTwo sets of multi-crystal samples aligned together were\nmounted in a He flow cryostat so as to measure a (h0l)\nscattering plane. All the data shown are converted to the\ndynamical susceptibility Im\u03c7 (qq, E). It is scaled to absolute units by comparison with the intensity of a standard vanadium sample. We note that a new point of the\npresent work is unprecedented experimental accuracy in\ndetermining the critical exponent using large samples\nand long counting time. This has enabled us to determine\nthe singularity of the QCP and to make qualitative conclusions of the universality class, which was very difficult in the pioneering work using the related compound\nCe1\u2212x Lax Ru2 Si2 [8, 9].\n\nPrevious Study of CeRu2 Si2\nLet us first make brief comments on our previous\nneutron scattering study of CeRu2 Si2 [17]. We showed\nthat spin fluctuations of CeRu2 Si2 are reasonably well\ndescribed by the SCR theory for heavy fermions [6]. This\nresult has the following two implications in connection\nwith the SDW QCP. First, the spin fluctuations at low\ntemperature T = 1.5 K can be parametrized by the SCR\nform [6]\n\n\u03c7 (qq, E)\u22121 = \u03c7L (E)\u22121 \u2212 J(qq) .\n\nY\n\n(a)\n\n(1)\n\nThis equation means that the local dynamical susceptibility \u03c7L (E) = \u03c7L /(1 \u2212 iE/\u0393L ), expressing the lo-\n\ncal quantum fluctuation by the Kondo effect, is modulated by the intersite exchange interactions Jr ,rr \u2032 [J(qq) =\n\u2211r 6=0 Jr ,0 exp(iqq * r )]. A number of constant-Q and -E\nscan spectra can be reproduced by Eq. (1) with the adjustable parameters of \u03c7L , \u0393L , and 14 exchange parameters [17]. In Fig. 1 we show observed and calculated\nintensity maps of constant-E scans with E = 1 meV at\nT = 1.5 K. One can see that the calculated intensity reproduces the complicated antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations with the three peaks and weaker structures around\nthe Z and N points.\nSecond, the temperature dependence of the spin fluctuations of CeRu2 Si2 [17] can be approximately described\nby the SCR scenario [6], in which the T dependence of\nEq. (1) is brought about by the single T dependent parameter \u03c7L (T ). The temperature dependence of \u03c7L (T ) is\ndetermined by the self-consistent relation [6]. The existence of this single T dependent parameter indicates that\nthe underlying mechanism is controlled by a neighboring SDW QCP. In fact, the numerically calculated \u03c7L (T ),\nshowing \u03c7L (T ) \u221d const \u2212 T 3/2 [17] in a low temperature\nrange, agrees with the computation [Eq. (2)] by the renormalization group theory of the SDW QCP [21]. Along\nthis line, the purpose of this work is to check whether\nthe T 3/2 dependence of \u03c7L (T ) really occurs in CeRu2 Si2\nand in the nearly tuned sample Ce(Ru0.97 Rh0.03 )2 Si2 .\n\nQCP of Ce(Ru1\u2212x Rhx )2 Si2\nIn the scenario of the SDW QCP in d = 3, which\nwas well established by the renormalization group theory\n[3, 4, 21], the wave-vector dependent susceptibility for\nthe tuned sample (x = xc ) diverges as \u03c7 (kk 3 ) \u221d T \u22123/2\n\n\fwhere c1 and c2 are x dependent constants. This equation\nis an approximation in the temperature range TFL \u226a T \u226a\nTK , where TFL is a crossover temperature below which\nthe system shows the Fermi liquid behavior [4, 21].\nThe imaginary part of the dynamical susceptibility at\nQ = k 3 + q with small |qq| and |E| is approximated [21]\nby\nIm\u03c7 (kk 3 + q, E)\n\u0393(kk 3 + q)\n\n=\n\n\u03c7 (kk 3 )\u0393(kk 3 )E\n,\nE 2 + \u0393(kk 3 + q)2\n\n[a quadratic expansion of Eq. (1)] where Dc and F are\nT independent parameters, and \u03bac is the inverse correlation length along the c-axis. In Eq. (3a) the product\n\u03c7 (kk 3 )\u0393(kk 3 ) is theoretically T independent. The two parameters Dc and F were determined by using constantQ and -E scans for both samples with x = 0 [17] and\n0.03 at T = 1.5 K. These data were fit to Eqs. (3) convolved with the resolution functions. In Fig. 2 we show\nconstant-E scans through the antiferromagnetic wave\nvector Q = (101) \u2212 k 3 , and the fit curves for the sample\nwith x = 0.03. The good quality of fitting indicates that\nEqs. (3) well describe the experimental data at T = 1.5\nK. We obtained x independent values of the parameters\nDc = 98 \u00b1 4 (meV \u00c52 ) and F = 0.12 \u00b1 0.01.\nThe temperature dependence of \u0393(kk 3 ) = Dc \u03bac2 for both\nsamples has been determined by performing constant-Q\nscans taken at Q = (101)\u2212 k3 . These scan data were fit to\nEqs. (3) convolved with the resolution functions, where\nthere are two adjustable parameters \u0393(kk 3 ) and \u03c7 (kk 3 ).\nSeveral fit results of the constant-Q scans for x = 0.03\nare shown in Fig. 3, where one can see that the quality of\nfitting is excellent. We also checked the T independence\nof the parameters Dc and F by comparing the constantE scans in Fig. 2 at T = 4 and 8 K with those calculated using the T dependent \u0393(kk 3 ) and \u03c7 (kk 3 ) determined\nby the constant-Q scans. The calculated curves in Fig. 2\nagree reasonably well with the observations. Thus we\nconclude that the theoretical approximation of Eqs. (3)\nhas been experimentally confirmed, and that the fit parameter \u0393(kk 3 ) has been determined very precisely.\nThe temperature dependence of \u0393(kk 3 ) is shown in\nFig. 4 by plotting data as a function of T 3/2 . At low\ntemperatures the observed data clearly agree with the\nlinear behavior of Eq. (2). In fact, by least squares fitting we obtained: \u0393(kk 3 ) = (0.67 \u00b1 0.01) + (0.0095 \u00b1\n\nE = 0.2\nE = 0.4\nE = 0.6\nE = 1.2\n\n5\nT = 1.5\n\nT = 1.5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\nT = 4.0\n\nT = 4.0\n\n1\nT = 8.0\n0\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n(3a)\n\n= Dc [\u03bac2 + q2c + F(q2a + q2b )] ,(3b)\n\n(b)\n\nT = 8.0\n\n1\n1.1\n(H 0 0.65)\n\n0.5\n\n0.6 0.7\n(1 0 L)\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\nFIGURE 2.

This theory also predicted that the SDW QCP is relevant for the threedimensional spin fluctuation, being in accord with the\npresent results. Finally we note that, to our knowledge,\nthe present work is the first clear experimental verification of the SDW QCP among single-crystalline neutron\nscattering studies on the QCPs of heavy fermions and delectron systems. Assuming that criticalities of QCPs are\nclassified into a limited number of universality classes,\nwe expect that the SDW QCP remains to be observed in\nother systems.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that the quantum\ncritical behavior of the heavy fermion Ce(Ru1\u2212x Rhx )2 Si2\nis controlled by the SDW type QCP in three space dimensions. The inverse correlation time, i.e., energy width\n\u0393(kk 3 ) of the dynamical susceptibility, shows a T 3/2 dependence predicted by the renormalization group and\nSCR theories\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe wish to acknowledge B.

(2) is proportional to the theoretical tuning parameter and, hence, c1 \u221d xc \u2212 x is normally assumed [4]. This assumption is consistent with\nthe observed values of c1 and the critical concentration xc = 0.04 \u00b1 0.005. On the other hand, the constant\nc2 is theoretically assumed to be weakly dependent on\nx [4]. However we observed appreciable x dependence\nc2 (x = 0.03)/c2(x = 0) \u223c 2, which may suggest certain\nunknown perturbations. Despite this problem, we think\nthat the critical exponent of 3/2, which is determined\nsolely by basic characteristics of the system (the space\ndimension d = 3 and the dynamical exponent z = 2), is\nmore important and decisive to conclude the nature of the\nQCP.\nAn advantage of the present neutron scattering study is\nthat Eq. (2) holds in a wider temperature range compared\nto those of indirect measurements of bulk properties. For\nexample, the leading terms of the specific heat C/T =\n\u03b30 \u2212 \u03b1 T 1/2 were shown to have too narrow T ranges\nto be clearly observed [8, 6]. In Fig. 4, the dashed line\nreproduces the SCR computation of \u0393(kk 3 ) for CeRu2 Si2\n[17]. Apart from discrepancy of the coefficient c2 , one\ncan see that the T 3/2 dependence of Eq. (2) is a good\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\n\nT.
