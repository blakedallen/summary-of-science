There has also been a strong interest in using the\nvoltage in the organic FETs to induce a sufficiently high\ndensity of carriers so that metallic states can be produced\nin the polymers.15,16\nUnlike traditional semiconductors, charge injection\ninto organic polymers induces structural deformations in\nthe polymer chains and gives rise to self-localized excitation states inside the band gap. The Peierls instability\nin trans\u2013polyacetylene (PA) leads to solitons,17 or kinklike excitations with a two\u2013fold-degenerate ground state.\nHowever, most of the conjugated polymers are analogous to cis\u2013PA, which consists of two non-degenerate\nground states (NDGS); i.e., the two conformations resulting from the mutation of a single and a double C\u2013C\nbond are not energetically equivalent. Two possible excitations in NDGS conjugated polymers are polarons or\nbipolarons that are associated to a pair of bound states in\nthe band gap split off from the continuum.17 Experimental evidence of similar signatures have been reported in\nP3HT and have been interpreted in terms of both types\nof excitations. Earlier work on chemical doping and photoinduced absorption in P3HT have assigned the two localized intragap states observed to bipolarons,18 whereas\na more recent study of RR-Poly(3-alkylthiophene) concluded that while chemical doping in P3HT films results\n\nin localized polarons, photoexcitations give rise to delocalized polarons.9 A charge modulation spectroscopy\nexperiment in regio-random P3HT in a metal\u2013insulator\u2013\nsemiconductor diode has identified five sub-gap transition features, out of which two are associated to optical transitions of doubly-charged bipolarons and three\nto singly-charged polarons, suggesting coexistence of the\ntwo charge species.19 More recently, however, the same\ntechnique applied to RR P3HT identified only three subgap features, which were assigned to polarons.8,20\nMetallic states attested by a finite density of states\nat the Fermi energy have been reported in chemicallydoped P3HT polymers using photoemission spectroscopy\nand have been attributed to the polaron lattice.21 On\nthe other hand, there exists a model which supports the\nbipolaron lattice in NDGS polymers, arguing that the\nmetallic states are a consequence of the merging of the\nbipolaron band with either the valence or the conduction\nband.22 However, in neither of these studies a prediction\nof the critical doping concentration under which P3HT\nbecomes metallic has been given.\nHere we report a joint theoretical and experimental\nstudy of charge-induced electronic excitations in P3HT.\nWe present models for three scenarios under which\ncharge-induced transitions between the bipolaron lattice\nand the polaron lattice or the merging between the localized states and the extended states can take place. We\npredict the critical doping thresholds above which metallic states can be expected in charge-injected P3HT. To\nthis end, we apply the continuum Hamiltonian model introduced by Brazovskii an Kirova23 (BK) for that takes\ninto account the electronic and lattice couplings. We carried out infrared spectroscopic studies in P3HT- based\nFETs. From these measurements we extract the chargeinjected doping levels and compare with the predicted\ncritical values, which provide a lower bound for metallic\nbehavior. The analysis suggests that the charge carriers\nin our P3HT FET are bipolarons and the highest charge\ninjection level reaches the proximity of the critical doping value that is needed for metallic states in P3HT. We\n\n\f2\nHere, the first term describes the interaction of the electrons with the lattice deformation \u2206i (x), \u03a8(x) is the twocomponents fermion field, \u03bb is the dimensionless electronphonon coupling strength, and vF is the Fermi velocity\nof the \u03c0-electrons. The second term describes the selfenergy of the \u03c0-electrons in a field of a dimerization potential \u2206(x), while \u03c3i are the Pauli matrices.\nIn the continuum limit, the analytical solution of the\nBK Hamiltonian represents a polaron or a bipolaron,\n\u2206(x) = \u22060 +kvF {tanh[k(x\u2212x0 )]\u2212tanh[k(x+x0 )]}, (2)\nwith\n\nalso discuss our results in view of very recent experimental evidence of field\u2013induced metallic behavior in P3HT\nFETs,15 and a structurally similar polymer with polyelectrolyte gate dielectric.24\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly\nreview the solution of the BK model as derived in the literature and provide an analytical formulation for bandwidths of polarons and bipolarons. In Sec. III, the solutions are applied to three scenarios involving polaron and\nbipolaron states in P3HT. From this study the critical\ndopings required to achieve metallic states in P3HT are\npredicted. In Sec. IV, we present experimental results on\ncharge injection in P3HT-based transistors and we compare them with the theoretical predictions in Sec. V.\nII.\n\nThe Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)\nelectron-phonon\ncoupling model and its continuum version26 have been\nwidely used to study structural excitations (solitons, polarons) in degenerate polymers such as trans\u2013PA. In\nNDGS polymers, however, the degeneracy is broken.\nA generalization of the SSH model by Brazovskii and\nKirova has been proposed to take into account the oneelectron energy gap in the absence of dimerization. The\nsolution of this model has been derived and discussed\nelsewhere;23,27,28 here we briefly summarize the main results.\nThe gap parameter contains both an intrinsic and an\nextrinsic contribution \u2206(x) = \u2206e +\u2206i (x), where \u2206i (x) is\nassociated with the dimerization due to the \u03c0-electronlattice interaction and \u2206e is a constant gap parameter\nthat arises from the \u03c3-bond orbitals. The BK continuum\nHamiltonian is written as\nZ\n\u2206i (x)2\nH =\ndx\n\u03c0\u03bbvF\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u2202\n\u2020\n+\ndx\u03a8 (x) \u2212ivF \u03c33\n+ \u2206(x)\u03c31 \u03a8(x).

The bandwidth can be calculated from the\noff-diagonal element of the BK Hamiltonian between unperturbed states on each polaron.29 Here we follow the\napproach of Onodera28 in which the interaction between\ntwo hole-doped polarons approaching each other are considered. When the doping level increases, the overlap of\n\n\f3\nelectron wave functions trapped in the two polaron dips\nin \u2206(x) gets stronger and the two bound state energy levels \u00b1\u03c90 are each split into two levels \u00b1\u03c91 and \u00b1\u03c92 (bonding and anti\u2013bonding states).

Here we apply the solutions to the BK\nmodel to predict the effect of the doping concentration on\nthe electronic excitations in P3HT. We considered three\ntypes of band diagrams as shown in Fig. 2. They correspond to a) a first-order transition between a bipolaron\nand a polaron lattice, b) a gap closure of the polaron band\nand the conduction or the valence band, and c) a gap closure between the bipolaron band and the conduction or\nthe valence band. In the latter two cases, we look for the\ncondition that the polaron (bipolaron) bands merge with\nthe extended states and we expect these transitions to be\nof second order.\n\nA.\n\nk 2 vF2 \u2212ka/y\ne\n.\nWp (y) = \u22124(\u03c90 \u2212 \u03c92 ) \u2243 8\n\u03c90\n\nc)\n\nP\n\nBP\n\nIII.\n\nat large distances. Therefore the separation between the\nbonding and antibonding states can be calculated from\nEq.

The\ntwo excitation states correspond to a pair of symmetrically localized levels46 in the gap that can be calculated\nfrom Eq. (5). To solve for k, we apply the self-consistency\ncondition Eq.

Therefore, upon doping, the charges will be\nstored in bipolarons rather than the polarons. However,\ndue to the partial filling, the energy per polaron changes\nwith doping, whereas the bipolaron energies remain unchanged because the bipolaron bands are either doublely\noccupied or empty. The condition to be satisfied by this\ntransition is\nWp (y) = \u03c0(2Ep \u2212 Eb ),\n\nand\n\u03b3zb\np\n= sin\u22121\n1 \u2212 zb2\n\nq\n\n1 \u2212 zb2 ,\n\n(17)\n\nfor the polaron and the bipolaron configuration, respectively, where z = k\u03be0 . The confinement parameter \u03b3\ncan be either estimated from the energy splitting between the doping-induced gap states27 or by solving for\nthe phonon propagator from Raman resonance dispersion\ndata.30 In either method, \u03b3 is estimated to be 0.3 \u223c 0.4\nin P3HT (we discuss later the effect of disorder on this\nparameter).18 Solving the above two equations, we find\nthat zp is in the range 0.553 \u2212 0.517 and zb in the range\n0.867 \u2212 0.829.\nThe energy gap of P3HT has been determined to be\n2\u22060 = 2.1 eV.18 Together with the above values of z,\nwe find the localized energy levels \u03c90 that correspond\nto the polaron and the bipolaron. The singly-occupied\npolaron states allow three optical absorption transitions,\nnamely, a transition between the valence band and the\n\u2212\u03c90 level (\u03c91 ), a transition between the valence band\nand the +\u03c90 level (\u03c92 ) and a transition between the two\nlocalized levels (\u03c93 ).27 For the bipolarons instead, the\nlast type of transition between the two localized levels\nis forbidden because the localized states are either both\nempty or doubly occupied. Using the value of \u03b3 = 0.4\nin P3HT, we calculated the optical transition frequencies\ncorresponding to the three transitions for the polaron and\nthe two allowed transitions for the bipolarons in Table I.\nSubstituting the self-consistent condition into Eq. (7),\nwe also find that the formation energy of a polaron and\na bipolaron can be expressed as Ep,d = \u03c04 \u22060 N (z) with\nN (z) = z + \u03b3 tanh\u22121 (z) and their values are shown in\nTable I.\nB.\n\nwhere Wp (y) is the bandwidth of the polarons we have\nderived in Section II. Substituting the formation energy\nof a polaron and a bipolaron in the above equation, we\nget\nWp (y) = 4\u22060 [2N (zp ) \u2212 N (zb )].\n\n(19)\n\nUsing the polaron bandwidth, Eq.

Since the \u03c0 bandwidth is a rather\nuniversal constant for most of conjugated polymers, we\nhave taken a typical value W \u223c 10 eV32 and obtained\n\u03be0 \u2248 4.7a. Therefore we find that yc \u223c 0.092.\nC.\n\nPolaron gap closure\n\nA second possible scenario corresponds to the case in\nwhich the polaron energy levels stay unchanged upon\ndoping but the bandwidth of the polaron states broadens\n(see Fig. 2b). When the doping is sufficiently large, the\npolaron band can merge with the extended states. This\nsituation can be realized as long as the condition\nWp (y) = 2\u03c91\n\n(21)\n\nis satisfied. Substituting this in the expression for the\npolaron bandwidth we obtain\n8z 2 \u22060 \u2212ka/y\nq p\ne\n= 2\u03c91\n1 \u2212 zp2\n\nTransition between bipolarons and polarons\n\nWe here discuss the transition between the bipolaron\nlattice and the polaron lattice (see Fig. 2a). This firstorder phase transition in NDGS conjugated polymers has\nbeen previously proposed without, however, an explicit\ncalculation of the critical doping density.29,31 This transition is similar to the energy crossover between the soliton lattice and the metallic polaron lattice, as proposed\nfor trans\u2013PA by Kivelson and Heeger.29 The formation\nenergy of a bipolaron is smaller than the formation en-\n\n(18)\n\n(22)\n\nand thus\nq\n\uf8f6\u22121\n\uf8eb\n2\nzp a \uf8ed \u03c91 1 \u2212 zp \uf8f8\nyc = \u2212\n.\nln\n\u03be0\n4\u22060 zp2\n\n(23)\n\nUsing the lowest absorption energy of a polaron state\nfound in Sec.

The critical\nadvantage of IR spectroscopy is that it directly probes the\nelectronic excitations associated with the injected carriers in organic FET devices.33 Combined with theoretical analysis in Sec. III, these experiments uncover the\nnature of the electronic excitations in P3HT. Moreover,\nthe carrier density in the accumulation layer of P3HT\ncan be evaluated from the analysis of IR spectroscopic\ndata, which provides new insights into the insulatormetal transition in polymers.\nLarge area organic FET devices33,34 (> 1 cm2 ) with\ngate insulator deposited on n-Si were investigated in\nthis work. In these devices, source and drain Au electrodes (with a spacing of 50-200 \u03bcm) were patterned\non a 200-nm-thick SiO2 gate insulator followed by the\ndeposition of a 4\u20136 nm-thick P3HT film. The inset of\nFig. 3 displays a schematic of the cross-section of the device. These devices has transport mobility of about 0.18\ncm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and breakdown voltage in excess of \u2212100V.35\nIn these bottom-contact FET devices, an applied gate\nvoltage induces an accumulation layer2,36 in P3HT as\nwell as in n-Si. The former accumulation layer constitutes the p-type conducting channel between the Au\nelectrodes. This channel is not obscured by any other\ninterfaces and is therefore well suited for the spectroscopic studies of the accumulation layer in the polymer\nfilm from far-IR to near-IR with the latter cut-off imposed by the band gap of the Si substrate.33 We studied changes of transmission as a function of applied gate\nvoltage VGS normalized by the transmission at VGS =0:\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Top panel: the 1-T(VGS )/T(0V) spectra for a representative SiO2 based organic FET device under\napplied gate voltages VGS .

Bottom panel: The mid-IR voltageinduced absorption spectra \u2206\u03b1d for the P3HT layer, which\nare obtained by subtracting absorption due to the accumulation layer in n-Si from the absorption spectra of the device as\ndetailed in the text.\n\nT(\u03c9,VGS )/T(\u03c9,VGS =0). Note that in the same sample\nstructure without a P3HT layer, we did not observe any\ngate voltage induced changes in the IR spectrum. This\nsuggests that no accumulation layer forms in the region\nbetween the gold grid electrodes without the P3HT layer\non the top of the insulator. The source and drain voltage is zero in most measurements. All the data reported\nhere were recorded at room temperature with a spectral\nresolution of 4 cm\u22121 .\nWe start by analyzing the absorption spectra \u2206\u03b1d =\n1-T(V GS )/T(0V) of the organic FET devices displayed\nin Fig. 3. Here \u2206\u03b1 is the change of the absorption coefficient of P3HT and d is the thickness of the accumulation\nlayer where absorption is formed. These spectra show\nseveral voltage-induced features: i) a strong absorption\nin far-IR frequencies (\u03c9 < 500 cm\u22121 ), ii) sharp resonances in the 1000 \u2013 1500 cm\u22121 region, and iii) a broad\n\n\f6\nTABLE II: The parameters of the Drude-Lorentz fitting\n(Eq.

A gradual development of these features with increasing gate voltages VGS\nsuggests that i-iii) are intimately related to the formation of charge accumulation layers on both sides of the\noxide. Features ii) and iii) are spectroscopic signatures\nof electrostatically doped carriers in P3HT.33 Sharp resonances in the 1000 \u2013 1500 cm \u22121 range result from the\nIR active vibrational modes (IRAVs);17 i.e Raman modes\nmade IR active by distortions of the polymer backbone\ncaused by the self-localized charges. The broad absorption band centered around 3500 cm\u22121 is usually ascribed\nto polaron or bipolaron states positioned in the gap17 ;\nthe lineshape of the broad band does not allow one to\ndiscriminate between the two types of excitations. Both\nthe IRAV modes and the polaron band can be quantitatively described33 by the amplitude mode model37 of\ncharge excitations in conjugated polymers. Features ii)\nor iii) are significantly weaker than the far-IR absorption\ni). We attribute the latter to the charge accumulation\nlayer on the n-Si side of the gate dielectric. The validity\nof this assignment is supported by quantitative agreement of the far-IR data with results for heavily doped\nSi38 as will be described in detail below.\nWe now turn to the analysis of the accumulation layer\n(AL) in n-Si. These results will help us to quantify the\n2-dimensional (2D) carrier density which is the same on\nboth sides of the gate dielectric in the P3HT/insulator/nSi structure. This task can be accomplished for example by fitting the low-energy absorption with the DrudeLorentz (DL) model, in which the complex dielectric\nfunction \u03b5(\u03c9) has the form:\n2\n\u03c9pD\n\u03c9p2\n\u03b5(\u03c9) = \u2212 2\n+ 2\n+ \u03b5\u221e .\n\u03c9 + i\u0393D \u03c9 \u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u2212 i\u0393\u03c9\n\n(27)\n\nThe first term in Eq. (27) stands for the Drude free carrier response with the relaxation rate \u0393D and the plasma\n2\n2\nfe\nfrequency \u03c9P D given by \u03c9PD\n= 4\u03c0N\nmb , where Nf is the\n2D density of free carriers and mb = 0.26me is the conduction band mass of Si. The second term is used to\naccount for small deviations of the dielectric function in\nmid-IR from the Drude form. The last term \u03b5\u221e is the\nhigh frequency dielectric constant. Two scenarios are the\nmost likely origins of the second term: frequency dependence of the relaxation rate of free carriers and/or interband transitions from donor impurities to the conduction\n\nband of Si at \u03c90 . The interband transitions are characterized by the relaxation rate \u0393 and the plasma frequency\n2\nMe\n\u03c9P given by \u03c9P2 = 4\u03c0N\n, where NM is the 2D charge\nm\u2217\ndensity and m\u2217 \u223c mb is the renormalized mass. It is advantageous to carry out the analysis using the \"effective\n2D\" carrier density in Eq. (27) in order to avoid any assumptions about the thickness of the accumulation layer\nin n-Si. The total 2D carrier density N2D = Nf +NM represents a lower limit of the density of the voltage-induced\ncharges.\nIn order to evaluate the consistency of the DL model\nwith the data, we first obtained optical constants for\neach of the constituting layers of our devices as described\nin Ref. 34 and then considered the transmission of the\nmulti\u2013layered sample: P3HT/SiO2 /2D-AL/n-Si. Results\nshown in the top panel of Fig. 3 suggest that the experimental spectra can be adequately described by modeling the AL response using Eq. (27) with parameters\npresented in Table II. Here we assumed that voltage\ninduced changes of P3HT in far-IR are negligible small\nin accord with dc measurements.35 The parameters we\nobtained for the response of AL are in good agreement\nwith the optical spectra of metallic phosphorus doped\nSi.38 The voltage-induced absorption spectra in the midIR frequencies for the P3HT layer can be obtained by\nsubtracting the absorption due to the accumulation layer\nin n-Si from the absorption spectra of the device, which\nare displayed in the bottom panel of Fig. 3.\nIn Fig. 4 we plot the 2D carrier density of charges N2D\ninjected in P3HT polymers obtained from the previous\nanalysis as a function of the gate voltage VGS . The carrier densities in the polymers reaches 1013 cm\u22122 at the\nhighest voltage. Therefore, we have shown that the carrier density in P3HT in our organic FETs at the highest\ngate biases is about N3D \u223c 1020 cm\u22123 corresponding to\napproximately one charge in every 10 thiophene rings,\ni.e., y \u223c\n= 10%.\nV.\nA.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nComparison with the IR spectra\n\nLet us now compare the theoretical predictions with\nthe IR spectroscopic results and discuss their implications. In Sec. III A, we have estimated the lowest optical\nabsorption frequency to be 0.16eV for polarons and 0.46\neV for bipolarons. In our IR spectroscopic studies, the localized absorption band due to charge injection is found\nat about 0.45 eV. The frequency is appreciably higher\nthan the predicted polaron absorption, while it matches\nreasonably well with the predicted bipolaron absorption.\nThe result seems to suggest that the localized band is due\nto bipolaron excitations. On the other hand, polaronic\nenergies reported in previous work seem to vary appreciably suggesting a dependence on the sample qualities\nand experimental platforms. Indeed, very broad range\nof polaron energies ranging from 0.06eV to 0.35eV has\n\n\f7\n\n-2\n13\n\n1\n\n12%\n\nyc(bp->p)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n10%\n\nyc(bp)\n\n8%\n\nyc(p)\n\n6%\n\n0.4\n\n4%\n\n0.2\n\n2%\n\n0\n0\n\n-20\n\n-40\n\n-60\n\nVGS (V)\n\n-80\n\n-100\n\nFIG. 4: The 2D carrier density of charges and the corresponding doping level y (solid triangles, solid line is to guide the eye)\ninduced in the P3HT polymer as a function of the gate voltage determined as described in the text. The density reaches\n1013 cm\u22122 (equivalent to 10%) at the highest VGS applied.\nThe horizontal lines mark the different ranges of the critical\ndopant concentration at which metallic states can be expected\npredicted from the theoretical models in Sec. III B\u2013III D.\n\nbeen reported in different P3HT systems.8,39,40 Considering that the simple model followed in this paper assumes\nidealized 1D infinite chains, there is a need to discuss in\nsome details the disorder effect on the localized bands\nand the optical transition energies. This discussion is\npresented in the subsequent subsection.\nThe calculations in Sec. III show that a relatively low\ndoping concentration of about 5% is expected to close\nthe gap between the polaron bands and the continuum\nstates, leading to a possible second\u2013order transition in\nP3HT. In our actual experiments, with a gate voltage of\n\u2212100V applied, the charge injection of the P3HT polymers achieves a doping concentration as high as 10% (see\nFig. 4), exceeding the threshold over which the polaron\u2013\nrelated transition occurs. However, we do not have any\ndirect evidence of metallic states, for example, through\nreduction of the oscillator strength of the IRAV modes\nnear this doping range.41 The insulating state at the doping level of 5% is thus consistent with our bipolaron interpretation of the spectra.\nOn the other hand, our results indicate that metallic\nstates in P3HT can be expected at a doping concentration of about 10% due to either a first\u2013order transition\nto the metallic polaron lattice or a possible second\u2013order\ntransition by closing the gap between the bipolaron band\nand the valence band. Both thresholds are close to the\nhighest doping achieved in our charge\u2013injected polymers.\nIn the following we suggest two issues that can lead to\nthe absence of direct evidence of metallic signatures in\nthe present experiment.\nFirst, recent experiments in P3HT FET suggested that\nat low temperature, a DC field is needed in order to overcome the tunneling barriers between the occupied localized states which can suppress conductivity of polymers\n\ny\n\nN2D (10 cm )\n\n1.2\n\nand result in insulating properties.16 Therefore while it\nis possible that the present P3HT system might have\nachieved a metallic carrier density, it is not clear that\none can observe metallic conductivity, as found recently\nthat only a small faction of the field-induced charge contributes to metallic conduction while most charges occupying the localized states.16 Second, in the FET device of\ninterest here, the absorption in the accumulation layer on\nthe n-Si side of the gate dielectric dominates the observed\nspectrum in the far-IR frequencies, because of its much\nhigher mobility compared to that of P3HT. As a result,\nit is difficult to directly subtract the Drude absorption\ndue to the n-Si from the absorption of the device so that\nthe Drude absorption and thus the metallic signatures of\nthe polymer at the far-IR frequency can be extracted.\n\nB.\n\nEffect of disorder\n\nIn quasi-1D conducting polymers, disorder is expected\nto have a particularly important role affecting both transport and other phenomena compared to systems with\nhigher dimensions. Indeed, previous work has suggested\nthat insulator metallic transitions in trans\u2013PA can result\nfrom disorder in the polymers.42 Here we discuss the sensitivity of our predictions to disorder of the polymers in\n\u2206e\nterms of the confinement parameter \u03b3 = \u03bb\u2206\n, which is\n0\ndirectly related to the energies of the localized states.\nIn the presence of a higher degree of disorder, we\nexpect that the degree of the conformational nondegeneracy would be lowered due to the configurational\nrandomness. Hence the external gap parameter \u2206e\nis lower compared to that of more regio-regular polymers. More importantly, disorder affects the confinement parameters through the electron-phonon couplings,\nthe strength strongly influences the electronic structure\nof organic polymers.43 In organic semiconductors, the\nelectron-phonon coupling constant is related to the conformational disorder through the degree of the chain conjugation. The coupling decreases with the conjugation\nlength,44 i.e., the length of the polymer segments separated by defects. Hence, the electron-phonon coupling\nincreases with disorder in the conjugated polymers. On\nthe basis of these arguments, one can anticipate that in\nthe presence of disorder, the confinement parameters \u03b3\nwould be smaller than that in polymers with higher regioregularity.\nIn Sec. III B\u2013III D, we have carried out calculations of\nthe critical densities in P3HT using \u03b3 \u223c\n= 0.4. Given the\ntrend that \u03b3 decreases with increasing disorder, it is instructive to recalculate the results at values of 0 < \u03b3 <\n0.4. To this end, we have recalculated the values using\n\u03b3 = 0.01 and obtained \u03c90 \u223c\n= 0.1eV\n= 0.75eV and \u03c90 \u223c\nthat correspond to the lowest optical absorption energies of 0.3eV and 0.95eV for the polarons and bipolarons, respectively. Note that the two bipolarons bands\nmerge into a single mid-gap state at \u03b3 \u223c\n= 0. The results\nshow that both the polaron and the bipolaron absorp-\n\n\f8\ntions blueshift with increasing disorder of the polymers.\nHowever, even at the smallest value of \u03b3, it appears that\nthe localized absorption in our experiment is still considerably higher compared to the predicted polaron absorption, thus supporting our assignment of the localized\nband as due to bipolarons, rather than polarons.\nExtending this analysis to the larger end of \u03b3, on the\nother hand, we find the lowest polaron absorption energies reduced significantly to less than 0.1eV when \u03b3 \u223c\n= 1.\nThis value is consistent with the recent photoinduced absorption measurement by \u00d6sterbacka et al. of highly\nregio-regular P3HT polymers,39 where the polaron absorptions are found to superpose with the IRAV modes at\nvery low frequencies less than 0.1eV. Similar absorption\nfeatures were also revealed by Brown et al. using charge\nmodulation spectroscopy in P3HT based MOS diode, albeit assignment of the polaron absorptions were given\nsomewhat differently.20 It is important to note that a distinction exists between the RR P3HT in our experiment\nand those in the earlier work,20,39 despite both exhibit\nhigh mobilities. In our experiment, the charge accumulation layer is restricted to the polymer/gate dielectric\ninterface within 1-2 nm of the 4-6 nm-thick P3HT films\ndue to the bottom contact FET structure, the interfacial\ndisorder14 would play a much more important role than\nin the \"bulk\" form of P3HT in the earlier experiments.\nWe thus suggest that the difference between the absorption peak we observed and those from the earlier work\nmight be related to the extent of the interfacial disorder\npresent in the samples.\nWe have also recalculated the doping thresholds at\n0 < \u03b3 < 0.4. This leads to a range of the critical doping\nvalues as shown in Fig. 4. For the first two cases discussed\nin Sec. III B and III C, the thresholds increase slightly\nwith decreasing \u03b3, i.e. with increasing disorder. For the\nbipolaron gap closure discussed in Section III D, the value\nof \u03b3 is lower bounded by the value at which the two bipolaron bands in the gap touch due to the band broadening,\nwhich corresponds to \u03b3 \u223c\n= 0.3. In other words, below this\nvalue, the bipolaron gap closure condition can not be satisfied. In the range of 0.3 < \u03b3 < 0.4 , the critical doping\nconcentration is nearly unchanged. We have indicated\nthe latter threshold by a single line in Fig. 4. Given\nthe fact that these ranges appear relatively insensitive\nto the structural disorder described by \u03b3, together with\nthe assignment of the carries to bipolarons, we may conclude that the maximum carried densities achieved in the\npresent experiments are in close proximity to the regime\nwhere a first\u2013order transition from bipolaron lattice to\nmetallic polaron lattice occurs.\nWe conclude this section by stressing that due to contact and interface effects, we expect the precise value of\nthe critical density for insulator-metal transition to be\nlarger than the one we have predicted above. In this respect, we compare our results to very recent experimental\ndata obtained by Panzer et al.15 and Dhoot et al.24 The\nfirst authors have reported field-induced charge injection\nas high as 1022 cm\u22123 in P3HT FETs with polyelectrolyte\n\ngate dielectric. At such densities \u2013 higher than our predicted minimal density \u2013 P3HT indeed shows metallic\ntransport properties. The second group24 finds strong\nevidence of metallic behavior in a polymer which is structurally very similar to P3HT. This metallic behavior is\nagain observed at carrier densities larger than the ones\nwe predict. These results therefore corroborate our prediction that a critical carrier density exists beyond which\nmetal-insulator transition can be expected in P3HT.\n\nC.\n\nLimitation of the model\n\nWe briefly comment on the limitations of our theoretical analysis. The BK model used in this paper does not\ndirectly account for the electron-electron interactions. In\nspite of ongoing efforts to incorporate electron-electron\ninteractions in the models of conjugated polymers,45 it\nis currently far from clear how that has to be done.\nNonetheless, it is worth noting that to some extent,\nelectron-electron interactions are effectively included in\nour calculations through the use of experimental values\nfor the parameters such as the band gap, the characteristic correlation length, and the confinement parameters.\nWe expect that explicit inclusion of the interactions in the\npresent treatment may modify somewhat the critical concentrations predicted in the analysis. On the other hand,\nthe theoretically calculated polaron/bipolaron energies\nand the experimental values obtained from our P3HT\nFET are in reasonable agreement. This agreement and\nthe insensitivity of the results to the doping concentration, and hence to the strength of the electron-electron\ninteractions suggest that the electron-lattice interactions\nare still the dominating effect in P3HT polymers. The\nelectron-phonon coupling model we use thus captures the\nessential physics of localized excitations.\nThe BK model also does not account for the electric\nfield. While the effect of the electric field is important for\nunderstanding polaron dynamics, we expect that it does\nnot play an important role in regioregular P3HT-based\ndevices considered in this paper. In the P3HT structures\nwe have studied, the P3HT chains form lamellae normal\nto the substrate with the chains oriented parallel to the\nsubstrate surface.8 As the applied gate field is perpendicular to the film surface, we expect that the P3HT chains\nare not subject to the gate field in the parallel direction\nand thus the electrostatic potential along each chain is\nconstant.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, we have analyzed the conditions to obtain metallic behavior in charge-injected P3HT polymers\nthrough a first-order phase transition between bipolaron\nand polaron lattices or gap closure between txshe bipolar/polaron bands and the continuum bands. IR spectroscopic measurements in P3HT thin film FET show\n\n\f9\nthat the highest charge injection level achieved in the\npresent experiments is in proximity to the predicted doping thresholds for the first case, indicating that metallic\nbehavior can be anticipated. Optical absorption frequencies are predicted for both polarons and bipolarons. The\nfrequencies associated to bipolarons are in good agreement with the absorption peak observed. Both conclusions remain true even when disorder is taken into account. We therefore conclude that the localized excitations we observe are likely to be due to bipolarons and\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\nR.
