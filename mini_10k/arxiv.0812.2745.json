Fischer\n\n1. Global symmetries, confinement and the infrared behavior of Yang-Mills theory\nIn this talk we are concerned with the infrared behavior of the dressing functions of the ghost\nand gluon propagators of QCD. There has been much debate in the past years about the zero\nmomentum limit of these functions mainly due to an apparent mismatch between solutions obtained\nfrom lattice gauge theory [1, 2] and functional equations in the continuum, i.e. Dyson-Schwinger\nequations [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and functional renormalization group equations [13, 14].\nIn these continuum studies the dressing function of the ghost propagator is divergent, whereas the\ngluon propagator is infrared finite or even vanishing. In terms of the dressing functions G(p2 ) and\nZ(p2 ) of the ghost and gluon propagators in Landau gauge\nG(p2 )\nDG (p) = \u2212 2 ,\np\n\n\u0012\n\np\u03bc p\u03bd\nD\u03bc\u03bd (p) = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2\np\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\np\u03bc p\u03bd\nD(p ) = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2\np\n2\n\n\u0013\n\nZ(p2 )\n,\np2\n\n(1.1)\n\nand in terms of a power-law expansion in the infrared the dressing functions are related by\nZ(p2 ) \u223c (p2 )2\u03ba \u2212 2 +2 ;\n\nG(p2 ) \u223c (p2 )\u2212\u03ba\n\nd\n\n(1.2)\n\nwith dimension d and positive and potentially irrational exponent \u03ba . These power laws are part of\nan all-order analytical analysis of both the whole tower of DSEs and FRGs in the infrared [9, 10].\nThey agree with a set of conditions formulated within a framework for confinement of covariantly\ngauge fixed Yang-Mills theory set up by Kugo and Ojima [15].\nThe Kugo-Ojima scenario rests on well-defined charges related to unbroken global gauge symmetries. In particular it assumes global BRST symmetry. The related well defined charge operator\nhas been used to identify the positive definite space H phys of physical states within the total state\nspace V of QCD. An unbroken global gauge symmetry is then crucial to show that the states in\nH phys contributing to the physical S-matrix of QCD are indeed colorless. They also argued that this\nsetup guarantees the disappearance of the 'behind-the-moon' problem, i.e. a colorless bound state\nwith colored constituents cannot be delocalized into colored lumps [15]. This then implements the\nconfining phase of Yang-Mills theory. In Landau gauge a direct consequence of the well defined\nglobal color charge is the infrared enhancement of the ghost dressing function G(p2 ) [15]. Such a\nbehavior is obtained in eqs.(1.2) if and only if \u03ba > 0.\nIn functional methods this enhancement can be implemented as an infrared renormalization\ncondition for the ghost dressing function. This condition leads to a unique [10] (scaling) solution\nof the whole tower of functional equations for the one-particle irreducible Green's functions of\nYang-Mills theory. In turn, given the Kugo-Ojima scenario an infrared divergent ghost implicitly\ndefines the unique gauge fixing with well-defined global BRST-charges [12].\nIn lattice calculations, however, the behavior (1.2) with \u03ba > 0 is notoriously difficult to obtain.\nIn the two dimensional theory (1.2) is nicely satisfied [16]. In three dimensions first hints of (1.2)\nhave been found in a formulation with an improved (evolutionary) gauge fixing algorithm [17],\nwhereas in four dimensions one obtains (1.2) in the strong coupling limit \u03b2 \u2192 0 for not too small\nmomenta [2]. In general, however, lattice calculations return the different behavior\nZ(p2 ) \u223c (p2 )1/2 ;\n\nG(p2 ) \u223c (p2 )0\n2\n\n(1.3)\n\n\fAspects of confinement from QCD correlation functions\n\nChristian S.

This limit for p2 \u2192 0, however, corresponds to a finite ghost dressing function and is therefore not in agreement with the Kugo-Ojima scenario. Within functional\nmethods also this 'decoupling' type of solution can be implemented by suitable boundary conditions in the infrared [6, 12, 18, 19, 20]. Up to logarithms, eqs.(1.2) and (1.3) completely exhaust\nthe possible infrared solutions of the functional equations of Yang-Mills theory.\nGiven confinement, an infrared solution with finite ghost at zero momentum (termed 'decoupling' below) implies broken global gauge and BRST symmetries [2, 12]. Indeed, all known\nBRST-quantizations that are compatible with an infrared finite ghost even break off-shell BRST,\nsee e.g. [20] and references therein. The only possibility for the decoupling solution to coexist\nwith a globally well-defined BRST charge is in a Higgs phase, where the breaking of global color\nsymmetry implies the existence of super-selection sectors. Certainly, this is not what is seen in\nlattice simulations of QCD and therefore one may conclude that BRST-symmetry is indeed broken\non the lattice [21]. Regarding global symmetries, the status of the decoupling solutions is therefore clearly different from the scaling solution: whereas scaling agrees with well-defined BRST\nand global color charges decoupling does not. Note, however, that both scaling and decoupling\nagree with the confinement criterion developed in [22]: both lead to a confining, nonperturbative\nPolyakov loop potential. Furthemore, in both cases the gluon propagator exhibits positivity violation [12].\n\n2. The ghost and gluon dressing functions\nAs already mentioned above the functional continuum equations, DSEs and FRGs, can display\nboth types of solutions, scaling (1.2) and decoupling (1.3). These are distinguished by a boundary\ncondition for the ghost dressing function at zero momentum, G(0). In [12] we demonstrated this\nbehavior using a truncation scheme for the DSEs developed to guarantee the transversality and\nmultiplicative renormalizability of the gluon DSE. As an alternative we also employed a truncation\nfor the corresponding equations in the FRG-framework, which has been developed to minimize\ntruncation artefacts in the mid-momentum region.\n3\n\n\fAspects of confinement from QCD correlation functions\n\nChristian S.

The\nboundary condition G(0) = \u221e results in the scaling solution, eq. (1.2), with a diverging ghost\ndressing function in the infrared and an infrared vanishing gluon propagator. The corresponding\n\u221a\ncritical exponent \u03ba in eq. (1.2) is given by \u03ba = \u03baC = (93 \u2212 1201)/98 \u2248 0.595353 [6]. A finite\nvalue G(0) = const., however, produces a continuous set of decoupling solutions with an infrared\nfinite ghost dressing function. The corresponding gluon propagator is massive in the sense that\nD(0) = lim p2 \u21920 Z(p2 )/p2 = const. for decoupling. In the ultraviolet momentum region, both types\nof solutions are almost identical, as expected.\nFinally we wish to emphasize that the question of scaling vs. decoupling only concerns global\nproperties of the theory as the (non-)conservation of charges. The behavior (1.2) or (1.3) sets in\nat scales p2 \u226a \u039b2QCD . In contradistinction all dynamics of the theory takes part on scales around\nor larger than \u039bQCD . Certainly, from a phenomenological point of view the behavior of the ghost\nand gluon dressing function at scales p2 \u2265 \u039b2QCD is much more relevant than the behavior in the\ndeep infrared. In Fig. 2 we compare the solutions from functional equations with the lattice results\nof ref. [23] for the gluon dressing function. It is very satisfactory that our numerical solution of\nthe functional renormalization group equations almost pointwise matches the corresponding lattice\nresults in the phenomenologically important mid-momentum region.\n\nAcknowledgments: We thank Reinhard Alkofer, Jens Braun, Jeff Greensite, Joannis Papavassiliou, Olivier Pene, Kai Schwenzer and Lorenz von Smekal for useful discussions.
