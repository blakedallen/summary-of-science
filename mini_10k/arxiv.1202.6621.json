The\nrate of h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 gets suppressed/enhanced in this model compared to the Standard\nModel (SM) due to the presence of the singly and doubly charged Higgs H \u00b1 and H \u00b1\u00b1 .\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the main goals of the LHC is the search for the scalar Higgs bosons and the exploration\nof the mechanism which is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking. However,\nin order to establish the Higgs mechanism as the correct one for electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, we need to measure the Higgs couplings to fermions and to gauge bosons as well\nas the self-interaction of Higgs bosons. If those measurements are precise enough, they\ncan be helpful in discriminating between the models through their sensitivity to quantum\ncorrection effects.\nIt is now well known, that at the LHC the branching ratio h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 can be extracted\nwith a precision of the order 15% at the high luminosity option of LHC [1] while at the\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC) it can be exctacted with about 23-25% for Higgs mass\narround 120 GeV [2]. In the case where the \u03b3\u03b3 option of ILC is available, with the 1%\naccuracy measurement of the branching ratio of h \u2192 bb\u0304 at ILC, the width \u0393(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) can be\ndetermined with 2% accuracy from \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 h\u2217 \u2192 bb\u0304 process, for Higgs mass of 120 GeV [2].\nTherefore, precise calculation of \u0393(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) within different beyond Standard Model (SM)\nis highly needed.\nRecently, the ATLAS and CMS experiments have already probed the Higgs boson in the\nmass range 110\u2013600 GeV, and excluded a Standard Model (SM) Higgs in the range 141\u2013476\nGeV at the 95%C.L. through a combined analysis of all decay channels and up to \u223c 2.3fb\u22121\nintegrated luminosity per experiment, [3]. Very recently, CMS and ATLAS exclude with\n4.9fb\u22121 datasets 1 to 2\u20133 times the SM diphoton cross-section at the 95%C.L. in most of the\nmass range 110\u2013130 GeV, and report an excess of events around 123\u2013127 GeV in the diphoton\nchannel, corresponding to an exclusion of 3 and 4 times the SM cross-section respectively for\nCMS [4] and ATLAS [5]. Furthermore, they exclude a SM Higgs in small, though different,\nportions of this mass range, (112.7)114\u2013115(.5) GeV for ATLAS and 127\u2013131 GeV for CMS,\nat the 95%C.L.\nThe SM Higgs sector, extended by one weak gauge triplet of scalar fields (hereafter\ndubbed DTHM), is a very promising setting to account for neutrino masses through the socalled type II seesaw mechanism. This Higgs sector, containing two CP-even, one CP-odd,\none charged and one doubly-charged Higgs scalars, can be tested directly at the LHC or\n\u2217 This work was supported by Programme Hubert Curien, Volubilis, AI n0: MA/08/186 as well as the\nLIA (International Laboratory for Collider Physics-ILCP).\n\n1\n\nLCWS11\n\n\fILC, provided that the Higgs triplet mass scale M\u2206 and the soft lepton-number violating\nmass parameter \u03bc are of order or below the weak-scale [6, 7]. Moreover, in most of the\nparameter space [and apart from an extremely narrow region of \u03bc], one of the two CP-even\nHiggs scalars is generically essentially SM-like and the other an almost decoupled triplet,\nirrespective of their relative masses, [6].\nIt follows that if all the Higgs sector of the model is accessible to the LHC or ILC, one\nexpects a neutral Higgs state with cross-sections very close to the SM in all Higgs production\nand decay channels to leading electroweak order, except for the di-photon channel. Indeed, in\nthe latter channel, loop effects of the other Higgs states can lead to substantial enhancements\nwhich can then be readily analyzed in the light of the experimental exclusion limits as argued\nabove.\nIn this paper we will analyze the decay h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 in the framework of DTHM. This\neffect will mainly come from singly and doubly charged Higgs boson contributions. We will\nshow that DTHM can account for the excess in the di-photon cross-section reported by\nATLAS/CMS, but it can also account for a deficit in the di-photon cross-section without\nmodifying the gluon fusion rate as well as the other channels like h \u2192 bb\u0304, \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , W W \u2217 , ZZ \u2217 .\n\n2\n\nHiggs sector of DTHM\n\nThe scalar sector of the DTHM model consists of the standard Higgs doublet H and a\ncolorless Higgs triplet \u2206 with hypercharge YH = 1 and Y\u2206 = 2 respectively. Their matrix\nrepresentation are given by:\n\u0013\n\u0012 + \u0013\n\u0012 + \u221a\n\u03c6\n\u03b4 ++\u221a\n\u03b4 / 2\nand\nH=\n(1)\n\u2206 =\n0\n+\n\u03c60\n\u03b4\n\u2212\u03b4 / 2\nThe most general SU (2)L \u00d7U (1)Y gauge invariant renormalizable potential V (H, \u2206) is given\nby [6, 7]:\nV\n\n=\n+\n\n\u03bb \u2020 2\n2\n(H H) + M\u2206\nT r(\u2206\u2020 \u2206) + \u03bb1 (H \u2020 H)T r(\u2206\u2020 \u2206)\n4\n\u03bb2 (T r\u2206\u2020 \u2206)2 + \u03bb3 T r(\u2206\u2020 \u2206)2 + \u03bb4 H \u2020 \u2206\u2206\u2020 H + [\u03bc(H T i\u03c42 \u2206\u2020 H) + hc]\n\u2212m2H H \u2020 H +\n\n(2)\n\nOnce EWSB takes place, the neutral components of the Higgs doublet and Higgs triplet\nacquire vacuum expectation values [6]. The DTHM is fully specified by seven independent\nparameters which we will take: \u03bb, \u03bbi=1...4 , \u03bc and vt . These parameters respect a set of\ndynamical constraints originating from the potential, particularly perturbative unitarity\nand boundedness from below constraints [6]. The model spectrum contains seven physical\nHiggs states: a pair of CP even states (h, H) with mh < mH , one CP odd Higgs boson A,\none simply charged Higgs H \u00b1 and one doubly charged state H \u00b1\u00b1 .\nThe mass of the SM-Higgs like h is fixed more or less by \u03bb parameter while the charged\nHiggs state masses, given below, will depend strongly on \u03bb4 and \u03bc:\n\u221a\n(vd2 + 2vt2 )[2 2\u03bc \u2212 \u03bb4 vt ]\n2\n(3)\nmH \u00b1 =\n4vt\n\u221a\n2\u03bcvd2 \u2212 \u03bb4 vd2 vt \u2212 2\u03bb3 vt3\nm2H \u00b1\u00b1 =\n(4)\n2vt\nLCWS11\n\n2\n\n\fFor a recent and comprehensive study of the DTHM, in particular concerning the distinctive\nproperties of the mixing angle between the neutral components of the doublet and triplet\nHiggs fields and its correlation with \u03bc parameter, we refer to [6].\n\n3\n\nh \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\n\nThe low SM Higgs mass region, [110, 140] GeV, is the most challenging for LHC searches.\nIn this mass regime, the main search channel through the rare decay into a pair of photons\nas well as the decay into \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 . The Higgs decay into two photons is only possible through\nloops. The theoretical predictions for its decay rate is well known in the SM for long time.\nFollowing the ref [6], we will see how singly charged (H \u00b1 ) and doubly charged (H \u00b1\u00b1 ) Higgs\nstates of the DTHM could enhance or suppress the two photons decay rate. Furthermore,\nsince one or the other of the two CP-even neutral Higgs bosons h, H present in the DTHM\ncan behave as a purely SM-like Higgs depending on the \u03bc parameter which fixes the regime\nunder consideration (see [6]), we will refer to the SM-like state generically as H in the\nfollowing. In the present paper, we will concentrate only on h as the SM-like Higgs, for the\nother case we refer to [8] for details.\nThe decay h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 is mediated at 1-loop level by the virtual exchange of the SM fermions,\nthe SM gauge bosons and the new charged Higgs states. Detailed analytic expression for\nthe partial width \u0393(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) can be found in [8]. Note that the structure of the H \u00b1 and\nH \u00b1\u00b1 contributions is the same except for the fact that the H \u00b1\u00b1 contribution is enhanced\nby a relative factor four in the amplitude since H \u00b1\u00b1 has an electric charge of \u00b12 units. For\nthe following discussion we denote Ah0 (H \u00b1 ), Ah0 (H \u00b1\u00b1 ) and Ah1 (W ) respectively the singly\ncharged Higgs, doubly charged Higgs and the W boson contributions to h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3.\nThe coupling of the SM-like higgs to the new charged Higgs states is given by:\nghH ++ H \u2212\u2212 \u2248 \u2212\u01ed\u03bb1 vd ,\n\nghH + H \u2212 \u2248 \u2212\u01ed(\u03bb1 +\n\n\u03bb4\n)vd\n2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u01ed is the sign of s\u03b1 , the mixing between doublet and triplet components, in the convention where c\u03b1 is always positive.\nAs well known, the decay width of h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 in the SM is dominated by the W loops which\ncan also interfere destructively with the subdominant top contribution. In the DTHM,\nthe signs of the couplings ghH + H \u2212 and ghH ++ H \u2212\u2212 , and thus those of the H \u00b1 and H \u00b1\u00b1\ncontributions to \u0393(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3), are fixed respectively by the signs of 2\u03bb1 + \u03bb4 and \u03bb1 , Eqs.(5,\n5). However, the combined perturbative unitarity and potential boundedness from below\n(BFB) constraints derived in [6] confine \u03bb1 , \u03bb4 to small regions. For instance, in the case of\nvanishing \u03bb2,3 , \u03bb1 is forced to be positive while \u03bb4 can have either signs but still with bounded\nvalues of |\u03bb4 | and |2\u03bb1 + \u03bb4 |. Moreover, since we are considering scenarios where \u03bc \u223c O(vt ),\nnegative values of \u03bb4 can be favored by the experimental bounds on the (doubly)charged\nHiggs masses, Eqs. (3,4). For definiteness we stick in the following to \u03bb1 > 0, although the\nsign of \u03bb1 can be relaxed if \u03bb2,3 are non-vanishing. Also in the considered mass range for\nh, H \u00b1 and H \u00b1\u00b1 , the charged state contributions Ah0 (H \u00b1 , H \u00b1\u00b1 ) are real-valued and take\npositive values in the range 0.3 \u2212 1. An increasing value of \u03bb1 will thus lead to contributions\nof H \u00b1 and H \u00b1\u00b1 that are constructive among each other but destructive with respect to\nthe sum of W boson and top quark contributions. [Recall that for the W contributions,\nReAh1 (W ) takes negative values in the range \u221212 to \u22127.] As we will see in the next section,\n3\n\nLCWS11\n\n\f4\n\n\u03bb\n\n=\n\n\u22121\n\nBR(h\n\n0\n\n---> \u03b3\u03b3)\n\nthis can either reduce tremendously the branching ratio into di-photons, or increase it by\nan amount that can be already constrained by the present ATLAS/CMS results.\nWe show in Fig. 1 (upper panel) the Br(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) as a function of \u03bb1 , illustrated for several\nvalues of \u03bb4 and \u03bb = 0.45, vt = 1 GeV. In this plot, the lightest CP-even state h carries 99%\nof the SM-like Higgs component, with an essentially fixed mass mh \u2248 114\u2013115 GeV over the\nfull range of values considered for \u03bb1 and \u03bb4 .\nAs can be seen from this plot, Br(h \u2192\n\u03b3\u03b3) is very close to the SM prediction [\u2248\n\u03bb = 0.45 , vt = 1 GeV , \u03bc = 1 GeV\n0\n2 \u00d7 10\u22123 ] for small values of \u03bb1 , irrespective\n10\nof the values of \u03bb4 .

Fur-1.5\nthermore, the latter functions remain real-2\nvalued in the considered domain of Higgs\n0\n10\n5\n\u03bb1\nmasses. There exists thus necessarily values of \u03bb1 where the effect of the destructive interference is maximized leading to a Figure 1: upper panel: Br(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) as a\ntremendous reduction of \u0393(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3). Since function of \u03bb1 for various values of \u03bb4 and\nall the other decay channels remain SM-like, \u03bb = 0.45 corresponding to mh \u2248 115 GeV.\nthe same reduction occurs for Br(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3). Lower panel: Scatter plot in the (\u03bb1 , \u03bb4 ) plane\nThe different dips seen in Fig. 1 are due to showing Br(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. In both panel: \u03bb = 0.55,\nsuch a severe cancelation between SM loops \u03bb3 = 2\u03bb2 = 0.2 and vt = \u03bc = 1 GeV, h is\nand H \u00b1 and H \u00b1\u00b1 loops, and they occur SM-like and mh \u2248 127 GeV.\nfor \u03bb1 values within the allowed unitarity\n& BFB regions. Increasing \u03bb1 beyond the dip values, the contributions of H \u00b1\u00b1 and H \u00b1\nbecome bigger than the SM contributions and eventually come to largely dominate for suf\u03bb4\n\n++\n\nB\nBF\nby ints\ned\nlud stra\nExc con\n\nLCWS11\n\n4\n\n\fficiently large \u03bb1 . There is however another interesting effect when \u03bb4 increases. Of course\nthe locations of the dips depend also on the values of \u03bb4 , moving them to lower values of \u03bb1\nfor larger \u03bb4 . Thus, for larger \u03bb4 , there is a place, within the considered range of \u03bb1 , for a\nsignificant increase of Br(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) by even more than one order of magnitude with respect\nto the SM prediction. This spectacular enhancement is due to the fact that larger \u03bb4 leads\nto smaller H \u00b1\u00b1 and H \u00b1 which can efficiently boost the reduced couplings that scale like\nthe inverse second power of these masses. For instance varying \u03bb4 between \u22121 and 1 in the\nupper panel case, decreases H \u00b1\u00b1 from 266 to 110 GeV, which modify the Br(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) by 2\norders of magnitude with respect to the SM value.\nIn Fig. 1, we show a scatter plot for Br(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) in the (\u03bb1 , \u03bb4 ) plane illustrating more\ngenerally the previously discussed behavior, for mh = 127 GeV, imposing unitarity and\nBFB constraints as well as the lower bounds mH \u00b1 & 80 GeV and mH \u00b1\u00b1 & 110 GeV on\nthe (doubly-)charged Higgs massesa . One retrieves the gradual enhancement of Br(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)\nin the regions with large and positive \u03bb1,4 . The largest region (in yellow) corresponding to\n\u22123\nBr(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) <\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10 encompasses three cases: \u2013the SM dominates \u2013complete cancelation\n\u00b1\nbetween SM and H , H \u00b1\u00b1 loops \u2013H \u00b1 , H \u00b1\u00b1 loops dominate but still leading to a SM-like\nbranching ratio.\nBesides the branching ratio of h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, and in order to compare our predictions with\nCMS and ATLAS data, we will consider the following observable relevant for LHC:\nR\u03b3\u03b3 (h) =\n\n(\u0393(h \u2192 gg) \u00d7 Br(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3))DT HM\n(\u0393(h \u2192 gg) \u00d7 Br(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3))SM\n\n(6)\n\nThe above ratio has the advantage that all the leading QCD corrections as well as PDF\nuncertainties drop out. Moreover, R\u03b3\u03b3 can be viewed as an estimate of the ratio of DTHM\nto SM of the gluon fusion Higgs production cross section with a Higgs decaying into a\nphoton pair. One should, however, keep in mind the involved approximations: assuming\nonly one intermediate (Higgs) state, one should take the ratio of the parton-level crosssections \u03c3(gg \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) in both models, which are given by Br(h \u2192 gg) \u00d7 Br(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3). Using\ninstead the ratio R\u03b3\u03b3 as defined in Eq. (6) relies on the fact that in the SM-like Higgs\nregime of DTHM, the branching ratios of all Higgs decay channels are the same as in the\nSM, except for h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 (and h \u2192 \u03b3Z, gg) where they can significantly differ, but remain very\nsmall compared to the other decay channels, so that \u0393(h \u2192 all)DT HM /\u0393(h \u2192 all)SM \u2248 1.\n\u03b3\u03b3\nIn Figs. 2 we illustrate the effects directly in terms of the ratio R\u03b3\u03b3 \u2248 \u03c3 \u03b3\u03b3 /\u03c3SM\ndefined\nin Eq.(6). We also show on the upper plot Figs. 2 the present experimental exclusion\nlimits corresponding to these masses, taken from [5]. As can be seen from Fig.2, one can\neasily accommodate, for mh \u2248 125GeV, a SM cross-section, R\u03b3\u03b3 (mh = 125GeV) = 1,\nor a cross-section in excess of the SM, e.g. R\u03b3\u03b3 (mh = 125GeV) \u223c 3\u20134, for values of\n\u03bb1 , \u03bb4 within the theoretically allowed region. The excess reported by ATLAS and CMS\nin the diphoton channel can be readily interpreted in this context. However, one should\nkeep in mind that all other channels remain SM-like, so that the milder excess observed\nin W W \u2217 and ZZ \u2217 should disappear with higher statistics in this scenario. This holds\nindependently of which of the two states, h or h, is playing the role of the SM-like Higgs.\na Recently, CMS puts a lower limit of 313 GeV on H \u00b1\u00b1 from H \u00b1\u00b1 decaying leptonically. This limit\ncan be reduced down to 100 GeV if one takes into account the decay channels H \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 W \u00b1 W \u00b1\u2217 as well as\nH \u00b1\u00b1 \u2192 H \u00b1 W \u00b1\u2217 [7, 9].\n\n5\n\nLCWS11\n\n\f2\n\n\u03bb = 0.531 , vt = 1 GeV , \u03bc = 1 GeV\n\n10\n\n\u03bb 4 = +1\n\n\u03bb 4 = +0.8\n\u03bb 4 = +0.5\n+0.12\n\u03bb4 =\n0.0\n\u03bb4=\n0.5\n=\u2212\n\u03bb4\n\n1\n\n10\n\n3.6\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n=\n\n-2\n\n4\n\n10\n\n\u03bb\n\n0\n\nR\u03b3\u03b3(h )\n\nWe comment now on another scenario, in\ncase the reported excess around mh \u2248\n125 GeV would not stand the future accumulated statistics. Fig.1(upper panel)\nshows different dips in Br(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) corresponding to the case of mh \u2248 115 GeV.\nThe ratio R\u03b3\u03b3 would have similar behavior as reported in Fig.1(upper panel) since\n\u0393(h \u2192 gg) will be quite similar both in\nSM and DTHM. Then, the large deficit for\nR\u03b3\u03b3 in parts of the (\u03bb1 , \u03bb4 ) parameter space\nopens up an unusual possibility: the exclusion of a SM-like Higgs, such as the one\nreported by ATLAS in the 114\u2013115 GeV\nrange, does not exclude the LEP events\nas being real SM-like Higgs events in the\nsame mass range! This is a direct consequence of the fact that in the model we\nconsider, even a tremendous reduction in\n\u03c3 \u03b3\u03b3 = \u03c3 h \u00d7 Br(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) leaves all other\nchannels, and in particular the LEP relevant cross-section \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Zh) essentially identical to that of the SM.\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u03bb1\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nLast but not least, exclusion limits or a\nsignal in the diphoton channel can be translated into constraints on the masses of H \u00b1\u00b1\nand H \u00b1 . We show in Figs. 2(lower panel)\nthe correlation between mh and mH \u00b1\u00b1 for\ndifferent ranges of R\u03b3\u03b3 . Obviously, the main\ndependence on mh drops out in the ratio\nR\u03b3\u03b3 hence the almost horizontal bands in Figure 2: Upper panel: R\u03b3\u03b3 as a function of\nthe plots. There remains however small \u03bb1 for various values of \u03bb4 , with \u03bb = 0.53 (h is\ncorrelations which are due to the model- SM-like and mh = 124\u2013125 GeV), \u03bb3 = 2\u03bb2 =\ndependent relations between the (doubly- 0.2 and vt = 1 GeV; The horizontal lines in)charged and neutral Higgs masses that can dicate the ATLAS exclusion limits [5].

In this plot we take large value for showing domains of R\u03b3\u03b3 values, we scan in\n\u03bb1 = 8 which give R\u03b3\u03b3 > 1 for light mH \u00b1\u00b1 . the domain .45 < \u03bb < 1.2, \u22125 < \u03bb4 < 3 with\nFor low values of \u03bb1 , as we learn from previ- \u03bb1 = 8, \u03bb3 = 2\u03bb2 = 0.2 and vt = \u03bc = 1 GeV.\nous discussion, the ratio R\u03b3\u03b3 remains below\n1 even for increasing H \u00b1\u00b1 and H \u00b1 masses.\nThe reason is that these masses become\nlarge when \u03bb4 is large (and negative) for\nwhich the loop contribution of H \u00b1 does not vanish, as can be easily seen from Eqs. (3,\n5).\nLCWS11\n\n6\n\n\f4\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nThe lightest neutral CP-even Higgs boson h of DTHM, has the same tree-level couplings to\nthe SM weak bosons Z and W \u00b1 , leptons and quarks, as the SM Higgs boson. For these\nreasons, the main production mode for such a Higgs is the usual gluon fusion, W fusion\nor Higgsstrahlung processes at LHC or Higgsstrahlung and W fusion processes at ILC. As\na matter of fact, the cross sections from all production modes are expected to be of the\nsame size as the SM Higgs. Moreover, Higgs boson h should have the same branching ratios\nto those SM particles to which it couples at tree level as the SM Higgs except for a small\nsuppression due to the mixing of the doublet with the triplet component. The loop-induced\ndecays, however, receive contributions from the charged states of the model. This is indeed\nthe case for the decays h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, \u03b3Z but not for h \u2192 gg. Therefore, it is expected that the\nloop mediated processes h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, \u03b3Z would have some large deviation from its SM values\nbut the total width of SM-like Higgs boson are nearly identical to the SM Higgs one. Any\ndeviations from the SM case concerning the SM-like Higgs boson production and decay at the\nLHC and/or ILC are expected to come solely from the branching ratio into two photons and\nnot from the production cross sections or decays into the other conventional channels unless\nif the sensitivity of those measurements are of comparable size with radiative corrections.\nTo conclude, we have discussed a possible enhancement/suppression of the partial decay\nwidth \u0393(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) in the DTHM for light charged states H \u00b1 and H \u00b1\u00b1 . The partial decay\nwidth \u0393(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) depends on the potential via the couplings hH \u00b1 H \u2213 , hH \u00b1\u00b1 H \u2213\u2213 . This\nmeans that a possible enhancement depends on the parameter space of the scalar potential.\nRestricting the parameter space of the DTHM with perturbative unitarity as well as vacuum\nstability constraints would restricts the possible enhancement of \u0393(h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3). In large area\nof parameter space of the DTHM, the deviations in the decay width for h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 from the\ncorresponding SM values can be quite large, therefore h \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 can be used to distinguish\nbetween DTHM and SM through the precise measurement program planed at ILC and its\n\u03b3\u03b3 option.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nA.
