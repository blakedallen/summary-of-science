Different explanations have been proposed for the existence of colonial\nbreeding behavior in birds, but field studies offer no conclusive results. We analyze\nthe interplay between learning habits and predation pressure by means of numerical\nsimulations. Our analysis suggests that extremely simple learning processes and equally\nsimplistic models of predation pressure lead to the formation of stable colonies.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nColonial breeding behavior in birds has been extensively studied [1\u20133]. Different\nhypotheses have been put forward in order to explain this behavior, like minimizing\nthe distance required for foraging [4], observation of conspecific foraging groups [5],\ninformation transfer at the colony [6], shortage of nests [7, 8], or predation pressure\n[1].\nOne of the difficulties in verifying the previous hypotheses is that present day\nconditions need not coincide with those which lead to colonial behavior in the first\nplace. Thus, modelling of bird populations using reasonable assumptions for bird\nbehavior can be useful in the elucidation of possible scenarios favorable towards\nthe evolution of coloniality.\nSome theoretical studies give support to the hypothesis that information transfer\nat the colony increases the tendency towards colony formation [9\u201311].\nPredation can induce colonial habits in many ways. The simplest passive mechanism is the dilution effect provided by a colony of sufficiently large size [12\u201314]. In\naddition, the detection and defense capabilities are enhanced in colonies [12,14\u201317].\nOn the other hand, the lack of significant predation pressure on some colonial\nspecies has been used as evidence against the predation hypothesis [13, 18], although a phylogenetic analysis of coloniality across bird species shows a strong\ncorrelation with exposure to predation [3].\n\n\fThe present work analyzes the role of predation on the formation of colonial\nhabits by means of a mathematical model which incoporates some of the known\nfacts about the response of birds to attacks by predators, and makes simple assumptions about the memory and learning processes at play.\n\nTHE MODEL.\nWe assume that the available choices to birds is limited to two possibilities each\nbreeding season: they can either form an individual nest, or join an existing colony.\nThis binary restriction allows us to make use of the extensive literature on competition and collective behavior of agents with bounded rationality [19, 20].\nSuccessful breeding individualstend to be faithful to their previous nesting site.\nBirds choose a colony or an isolated nest depending on their previous experience.\nThis experience is modelled in a similar way to that used in the so called \"minority\ngame\" [20, 21]. Each bird has, as already mentioned, two strategies. Each of these\nstrategies has a score, which reflects the degree of reproductive success that the\nbird would have had if it had followed it. In this sense, the model departs from\nthe minority game usually analyzed in the literature, where the score of strategies\nis the same for all agents. The present version reflects the diversity of birds, due\nto genetic differences and other sources, and resembles the \"individual\" version of\nthe minority game [22].\nA bird who made a succesful choice assigns the achieved score to its available\nstrategies whose outcome is the same choice that it has taken. On the other hand,\na bird whose nest is predated increases the score of those strategies whose outcome\nis the opposite.\nIndividual strategies, when succesful, obtain a larger score than colonial strategies\n(2 vs. 1), reflecting the ancestral tendency of birds to solitary breedingin the\nabsence of predation. The number of sites is much larger than the number of birds.\nUnless otherwise stated, the predation probability, ppr fluctuates between 0 and a\ngiven value, pmax . In this way, we model the natural variability of the abundance\nof predators.\nAt each time step, which corresponds to one breeding season, there is a finite\nprobability that a nest will be predated. Predation of nests in a colony of size N\nis reduced by a factor proportional to N. We do not follow the detailed evolution\nof individual colonies in the habitat. Instead, we assume that there is a fixed\ndistribution of colony sizes, such that the probability of finding a colony of a given\nsize is inversely proportional to its size. This is the expected behavior if the relative\nfluctuation of colony sizes is random. The distribution is normalized to the total\nnumber of birds that have colonial behavior.\nWe model the birds' finite lifespan by setting the score of the strategies of a given\nbird to zero with some finite probability, p = v1 , at each time step. This implies\nthat a bird has been replaced by a new one with no previous experience. The total\npopulation is kept constant.\n\n\fRESULTS.\n\nWe show, in fig. (1), the number of colonial birds, as function of time, for different\nvalues of pmax , and two lifespans (3 and 10 years).The number of birds is 10000.In\nthe absence of predation, individual strategies acquired two points per season, while\ncolonial behavior was awarded one point, reflecting the genetic tendency towards\nindividual nests.\nFinally, we have considered two possible behaviors: a) each individual may check\nthe scores of all its strategies, and uses the one with the highest score every breeding\nseason. Thus, birds would rely its decisions on their long-term previous experience\n(long-term experience). b) If the nest of a given individual was not predateds\nduring the previous season, it repeats the last choice. If the nest was predated, the\nindividual acts as in behavior (a).\nAll birds were located in individual nests at t = 0, and we have followed the\nevolution of the population during 104 time steps.\n\nFIGURE 1. Evolution of the number of colonial birds, as function of time, for different maximum predation pressure. Top graphs: Short-lived species relying on (A) their long-term previous\nbreeding experience, and on (B) their immediate previous breeding experience. Bottom graphs:\nLong-lived species relying on (c) their long-term previous breeding experience, and on (D) their\nimmediate previous breeding experience.\n\n\fCONCLUSIONS.\nOur results suggest that colonial behavior can arise as a natural response to\npredation pressure. Note that we made a number of conservative assumptions, in\norder to avoid any bias towards colonial behavior: i) The birds have an innate\ntendency towards preferring individual nests, ii) The only protection provided by\nthe colony is the dilution effect, iii) The distribution of colonies is such that small\ncolonies are more abundant, and iv) predation pressure fluctuates strongly from\nyear to year, allowing for the existence of periods of low predation.\nThe number of colonial birds increases with increasing lifespan, as birds accumulate experience for a longer period. This evidence is in agreement with the\nobservation that birds make use of their long term breeding experiences [23\u201326].\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
