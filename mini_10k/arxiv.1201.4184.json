As a nearly\nmassless excitation of the QCD vacuum with pseudoscalar quantum numbers, the pion plays a\ncentral role in particle and nuclear physics as a harbinger of spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nThe pion is associated with large distance structure of the nucleon [1, 2] and the longest\nranged component of the nucleon-nucleon force [3]. In lattice QCD calculations the nucleon\nmass depends on an input value of the quark mass, which generates a pion mass \u03bc, and\nextrapolation formulae depending on \u03bc are typically used [4\u20137] (see the review [8].) In addition,\nthe pion cloud plays an important role in deep inelastic scattering on the nucleon, especially\nin understanding the violation of the Gottfried sum rule [9, 10].\nPhenomenological calculations of pion-nucleon interactions are beset with uncertainties related to the dependence of the vertex function on momentum transfer and on the possible\ndependence upon the virtuality (difference between the square of the four-momentum and\nmass squared) of any intermediate nucleon or baryon. Moreover, modern treatments of spin\n3/2 baryons such as the \u2206 (baryon excitation of lowest mass) within the Rarita-Schwinger\n(RS) [11] formalism have been problematic as discussed in [12]. The pathologies of the \u03c0N \u2206\ncoupling have long been known [13\u201317]. The aim of the present letter is to develop and apply\na method that is free of those ambiguities.\nAs a specific example, consider the role of the pion cloud in deep inelastic scattering. This is\nrelated to the pion contribution to the nucleon self-energy of Fig. 1a. One needs to include\nthe term in which the virtual photon interacts with the pion [18], Fig. 1b, but one also\nneeds to include the effects of the virtual photon hitting the nucleon, Fig. 1c. Conservation\nof momentum and charge would seem to require that the argument of the vertex function\ndepends on the square of the invariant mass of the intermediate pion-baryon system (s) [19].\nTaking the form factor to have the standard form of depending on the square of the fourmomentum transfer, between the initial nucleon and intermediate baryon (t), while natural,\npopular and effective [20],[2] seemingly disagrees with charge and momentum conservation\naccording to [19].\nBut chiral symmetry (limit of vanishing pion mass) provides strong guidance. It is known\nthat the \u03c0N vertex function G\u03c0N (t) and the nucleon axial form factor are related by the\ngeneralized Goldberger-Treiman relation [21]):\nM GA (t) = f\u03c0 G\u03c0N (t),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere t is the square of the four-momentum transfered to the nucleons, GA (t) is the axial\nvector form factor and f\u03c0 is the pion decay constant. The result Eq. (1), obtained from a\nmatrix element of the axial vector current between two on-mass-shell nucleons, follows from\nPCAC and the pion pole dominance of the pseudoscalar current. Using Eq. (1) has obvious\npractical value because it relates an essentially unmeasurable quantity G\u03c0N with one GA that\nis constrained by experiments. However the t dependence inherent in Eq. (1) would seem to\nviolate the purported consequence of momentum conservation. Similarly the pionic coupling\nbetween nucleons and \u2206 particles has an off-diagonal Goldberger-Treiman relation [22\u201324],\nobtained using similar logic:\n2M C5A (t) = f\u03c0 G\u03c0N \u2206 (t),\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\fk\n\nx\n\nx\n\np\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(d)\n\n`\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Pionic (dashed line) contribution to the nucleon (solid line) self-energy. (b) External\ninteraction, x, with the pion (c) External interaction, x, with the intermediate nucleon. (d) Effect of\n2\u03c0-nucleon interaction.\n\nwhere C5A is the Adler form factor [25, 26], accessible in neutrino-nucleon interactions.\nThe present manuscript develops a method that satisfies momentum conservation, utilizes\nEq. (1) and involves only on-mass-shell nucleons. The key to removing ambiguities lies in\nevaluating the relevant Feynman diagrams by carrying out the integration over the fourmomentum k by first integrating over k \u2212 (the light front energy) in such a way that the\nintermediate baryon is projected onto its mass shell. This allows the use of the on-mass shell\nform factors Eqs. (1,2) and is manifestly consistent with charge and momentum conservation.\nConsider the contribution to the nucleon self-energy \u03a3\u03c0 (N ), involving an intermediate\nnucleon, Fig. (1a), given by Feynman rules as\nZ\nd4 k\n\u03b3 5 (6 p\u2212 6 k + M )\u03b3 5\n2\n\u03a3\u03c0 (N ) = \u2212i3g\u03c0N \u016b(P )\nu(P )F 2 (k 2 ),\n(3)\n4\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(2\u03c0) (k \u2212 \u03bc + i\u000f)((p \u2212 k) \u2212 M + i\u000f)\nwhere M, \u03bc are the nucleon and pion masses. The quantity P represents the nucleon momentum and spin, (p, s), evaluated in the proton rest frame. We use the notation: G\u03c0N (t) \u2261\ng\u03c0N F (t) = fM\u03c0 GA (t), with GA (0) = 1.267 \u00b1 0.04, M = 0.939 GeV, f\u03c0 = 92.6 MeV, g\u03c0N \u2261\nG\u03c0N (0) = 13.2 with F (0) = 1. The term F (k 2 ) represents the pion nucleon form factor. Its\ndependence on a single variable is justified only if the pionic vertex function appears between\n3\n\n\ftwo on-mass-shell nucleons. In that case, one may use a dispersion relation:\nZ\n1 \u221e\n2\nF (k ) =\ndt0 Im[F (t0 )]/(k 2 \u2212 t0 ).\n\u03c0 (3m\u03c0 )2\n\n(4)\n\nPerforming the spin average of Eq.

Thus\nWe evaluate \u03a3\u03c0 (N ) using light-front coordinates: k \u00b1 \u2261 k 0 \u00b1 k 3 , k 2 = k + k \u2212 \u2212 k\u22a5\nR\n2\n3g\u03c0N\n\u03a3\u03c0 (N ) = M\ndk + d2 k\u22a5 J, with\nZ\n1 1\nk*p\nJ =\ndk \u2212 F 2 (k 2 )\n.\n(6)\n2 +\u03bc2 \u2212i\u000f\n4\nk\nk2 +M 2 \u2212i\u000f\ni(2\u03c0) 2\nk + (p \u2212 k)+ (k \u2212 \u2212 \u22a5 k+ )((p \u2212 k)\u2212 \u2212 \u22a5p+ \u2212k+ )\n\nThe expression Eq. (4) for F (k 2 ) is not written explicitly here because the analytic structure\nis the same as that of 1/(k 2 \u2212 \u03bc2 + i\u000f). If 0 < k + < p+ , the first pole in k \u2212 is in the lower\nhalf k \u2212 plane (LHP) (as are the ones arising from F (k 2 )) and the intermediate nucleon pole is\nin the upper half plane (UHP). We integrate over the UHP, so that the only pole we need to\nconsider is the one in which the intermediate nucleon is on its mass shell and the momentum\nk is space-like. For k + < 0 and k + > p+ all of the poles are on the same side of the real axis,\nand one obtains 0. We take the residue of the integral for which the nucleon is on shell so\nM 2 +k2\nthat k \u2212 = p\u2212 \u2212 p+ \u2212k+\u22a5 . Using the residue theorem and integrating over k + leads to the result\n\u03c0\n2\n\u03a3\u03c0 (N ) = \u22123g\u03c0N\n8M (2\u03c0)3\n\nZ\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nt F 2 (\u2212t)\ndt\n(t + \u03bc2 )\n\nt\n\u2212 2+\nM\n\nr\n\nt2\n4t\n+ 2\n4\nM\nM\n\n!\n.\n\n(7)\n\nThis result is obtained by using the pseuodscalar form of \u03c0N coupling in Eq. (3), but the use\nof pseudovector coupling would give the same result because the intermediate nucleon is on\nits mass shell.\nTo proceed we use a specific form of the form factor F , the commonly used dipole\nparametrization\nF (Q2 ) = 1/(1 + (Q2 /MA2 ))2 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwith MA as the so-called axial mass. The values of MA are given by MA = 1.03 \u00b1 0.04 GeV\nas reviewed in [21]. This range is consistent with the one reported in a later review [27].\nA somewhat lower value (0.85 Gev) is obtained [28] if one restricts the extraction region\nto very low values of Q2 , but we need higher values to evaluate Eq. (7).

The term independent of\nthe pion mass provides a -0.222 M correction to the bare nucleon mass, in contrast with\nan early approach (not using the heavy baryon expansion) which gives a contribution of\nformal order M (M/4\u03c0f\u03c0 )2 [29]. The term of order \u03bc3 reproduces the standard expression:\n\u22123gA2 /(32\u03c0f\u03c02 )\u03bc3 [30].\nThe next step is to include terms with an intermediate \u2206, the baryon excited state of lowest\nmass, which couples strongly to the \u03c0N system. The effects of other intermediate baryons\nare not included in this first evaluation, but our technique can be applied to those states.

These are shown in Fig. 2\nand the chiral approximation \u03a3\nas a function of the varying pion mass \u03bc, the only parameter that is varied. Bare masses,\nf0 = 2.06 GeV have been added to \u03a3\u03c0 , \u03a3\ne \u03c0 so as to reproduce the lattice\nM0 = 2.42 GeV, M\ndata point at \u03bc/4\u03c0f\u03c0 = 0.252(\u03bc = 293) MeV. We use MA = 1.03 GeV. The use of the exact\nexpression gives an approximately linear dependence on the pion mass, in agreement with the\n\"surprisingly linear\" results of lattice QCD simulations [8, 35], found for values of \u03bc greater\nthan about 290 MeV. The LHP lattice data [35] are shown, and these are consistent with other\nlattice calculations as reviewed Varying the value of MA within the stated range changes the\nvalue of \u03a3\u03c0 only for \u03bc > 0.5 GeV, and by 5 % or less. The low-order chiral approximation of\nEq. (10) and Eq. (14) fails badly, showing that the chiral logarithms do not dominate for the\nrelatively large values of \u03bc used in many previous lattice QCD calculations. One could carry\nout the expansions of Eq. (10) and Eq. (14) to higher order in \u03bc, but convergence requires\nmany terms. One achieves a satisfactory description of \u03a3(N ) up to \u03bc = 0.65 GeV by keeping\nterms up to order \u03bc24 , and of \u03a3(\u2206) up to \u03bc = M\u2206 \u2212 M GeV by keeping terms up to order\n\u03bc20 .\n6\n\n\fMHGeVL\n2.0\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n\n\u039c\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 4 \u03a0 f\u03a0\n\nFIG. 2: Nucleon mass as a function of \u03bc.

Dashed: chiral approximation \u03a3\n\nIt is worthwhile to compare our procedure with that of some others. For example, if one\nuses the heavy baryon limit to simplify Eq. (3), evaluates the integral by taking the pion to\nbe on its mass shell and regularizes the divergent integral over momentum using a cutoff at\na maximum momentum, one obtains results that correspond to the terms used in [5]. The\nrelativistic procedure of [36] avoids the use of the heavy baryon limit by treating the nucleon\nrecoil terms using an expansion procedure and uses dimensional regularization. We include\nall of the recoil terms and employ a cut-off procedure that is constrained by experimental\ndata. In chiral perturbation theory, our procedure corresponds to keeping a specific set of\nhigher-order terms with a fixed relation between them, a relation fixed by experimental data.\nOur results do not include contributions of order higher than 1/f\u03c02 . These may be considered as keeping the lowest order pion cloud corrections using an expansion\nin powers of\n\u221a\n2\n\u03b5 \u2261 1/(4\u03c0f\u03c0 R) , where R is a confinement radius [1, 37, 38]. Here R \u223c 12/MA , so \u03b5 \u2248 1/12.\nThus we expect our results for the terms computed here to be accurate within about 10%. This\nargument was mainly applied to terms involving combinations of couplings of the nucleon to\na single pion, but also holds for the n-pion-nucleon vertex e.g. as appearing in Fig. 1d. These\nterms enter at higher orders in \u03bc in chiral perturbation theory [39]. The coupling constant\ng\u03c0N and the confinement sizes of the pion and the nucleon, although not explicit in chiral\nperturbation theory, enter into the calculation of the diagram in terms of quarks and gluons\nand via the implicit dependence of f\u03c0 and g\u03c0N on the underlying strong coupling constant,\n\u03b1S . Therefore we expect that the terms of the chiral Lagrangian will be consistent with the\nexpansion in \u03b5.\nTo test our treatment of the nucleon self-energy, we consider the contribution to leptonnucleon deep inelastic scattering DIS arising from virtual pions.

For Fig. 1b, the pion cloud of a proton will include \u03c0 + (ud)\nhas equal numbers of d \u0304 and \u016b. Only valence quarks of the pions are considered; the pion sea\ndistributions are assumed to be symmetric. The probability for a \u03c0 + n intermediate state is\n2/3, and that for a \u03c0 0 p state is 1/3. Including also the effects of an intermediate \u2206 leads to\nZ 1\n2\n1\ndyy( f\u03c0N (y) \u2212 f\u03c0\u2206 (y)),\nD\u03c0 =\n(23)\n3\n3\n0\nwith the probability of \u03c0 \u2212 \u2206++ = 1/2 and that for \u03c0 + \u22060 =1/6. Since a bare baryon is assumed\nto have a symmetric sea, possible contributions from Fig. 1c do not enter. Using MA = 1.03\nGeV, the nucleonic contribution is 0.173, and the \u2206 contribution is -0.064, so that the total\nis 0.109, within the experimental range of Eq. (22).\nTo summarize: our light front treatment of the relevant Feynman diagrams reveals that\nthe pion-baryon vertex function appears only between on-mass-shell baryons. This allows the\nvertex function to be expressed in terms of one variable, the invariant momentum transfer t,\nand to be constrained by experimental data. All ambiguities regarding the theoretical input\nneeded to evaluate effects of the pion cloud to second-order in the coupling constants for\nthe effects of intermediate N, \u2206 are resolved. The uncertainty due to the neglect of higherorder terms is estimated to be about 10%. Our procedure reproduces the observed linear\ndependence of the nucleon mass on the pion mass found in lattice QCD calculations and the\nflavor asymmetry of the nucleon sea. This work has implications for nucleon-nucleon scattering\nbecause one is instructed to use the coupling implied by Eq. (1), and also for computing pion\ncloud effects on the elastic electromagnetic form factors of nucleons [43].\n\n9\n\n\fAcknowledgements\n\nThis work has been partially supported by U.S. D. O. E.
