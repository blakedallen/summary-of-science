It provides\na simple (coarse-grained) description of natural as well as social and technological complex systems, by means of\nmapping their elements and interactions on the vertices and the edges of a graph [1]. Different systems correspond\nto microscopically different networks, but their general statistical properties may display similarities. Using the tools\nof statistical physics in analyzing experimental data, researchers have obtained important insights on the structure\nof these complex networks, discovering universal properties that are common to very different systems. In particular,\nmost of real networks seem to be sparse, with a very small diameter (small-world property), and to present large\nfluctuations in the connectivity (degree) of the nodes.\nThe theoretical models pretending to explain the origins of these universal properties can be roughly divided in two\nclasses: static models, in which the network structure is the result of some precise combinatorial assignment, and\ngrowing models, in which new nodes attach to a pre-existing network by means of a given number of links [2, 3].\nMuch less attention was instead devoted to the other very important issue concerning the relation between networks\nstructure and the processes used to collect the experimental data. Some questions arise naturally: are the experimental data really reliable? can the ubiquity of some properties be the result of systematic biases introduced by the\nsampling process itself?\nThese questions have been recently addressed in a series of works [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] that study the sampling of networks\nfrom both static and dynamical points of view. Among them, the work by Petermann and De Los Rios [4] is the\nfirst in which the idea that different generation algorithms may lead to different topological properties is exploited to\nshow analytically that the observed power-law degree distributions can be an artifact of biases affecting the sampling\ntechniques.\nThis issue is particularly relevant for the physical Internet, that is the prototype of a complex network: a huge number of computers are connected together to form a continuously evolving, self-organizing network, on which a large\nvariety of dynamical processes take place [9]. As the robustness and performances of large technological networks\nstrongly depend on their topology, an accurate, unbiased knowledge of the Internet is necessary to support the work\nof practitioners in improving its structure and functioning.\nMotivated by the importance of correctly knowing network's topology, the present work is devoted to clarify the mechanisms governing the main techniques used in the dynamical sampling of complex networks. In order to accomplish\nthis task, we first present the general framework that applies to a large class of tree-like dynamical processes, then\nwe focus on the traceroute sampling of networks with homogeneous and heterogeneous degree profiles. We show that\nthe role played by the dynamics is very different in homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. In the latter case,\nthat should correspond to the case of the Internet, the sampling process introduces some level of inhomogeneity that\nparadoxically increases the sampling accuracy of the tail of the degree distribution.\nOur results are in agreement with previous analytical and numerical achievements, but allow a more unitary view\nof the problem. Dynamical sampling techniques are examples of the interplay between networks topology and the\ndynamics occurring on it. Therefore the dynamical approach presented in this paper could be considered as a theoretical improvement with respect to previous analytical studies based on nodes exposure methods [10, 11], that are\nessentially static algorithms.\nMoreover, our method can be easily adapted to study other sampling algorithms expressly designed to acquire egocentric views of a network, such as network's tomography [12, 13] and crawling algorithms in community networks\n(the WWW, P2P networks, etc.) [14]. Similar dynamical patterns are observed also in network processes that are not\ndirectly related to sampling, such as epidemics [15], rumors spreading [16], diffusion of innovations [17] and threshold\nmodels [18].\n\n\f2\nIn summary, we provide a unified description of a class of dynamical phenomena in terms of tree-like evolving structures on networks, and explain how the dynamical rules influence the emerging topological properties, by focusing on\nthe degree distribution.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present the general theoretical formalism that can be used\nto study the degree distribution generated by tree-like processes on networks. The important application to the\ntraceroute problem is discussed in Section III. Some conclusions are presented in Section IV together with examples\nof other possible applications.\nII.\n\nGENERAL FORMALISM FOR TREE-LIKE PROCESSES\n\nAmong the various types of algorithms and dynamical models evolving on networks, we take into account those\ncorresponding to the following general dynamical picture, that is also valid for the special case of traceroute-like\nexplorations. Let us assume the process starts from a single node and propagates iteratively throughout the network.\nAt each temporal step, some nodes at the interface of the growing cluster are selected and some of their still unreached\nneighbors are visited. The latter ones become part of the interface, while the former interfacial nodes are moved to\nthe bulk of the cluster (a sketch of the dynamics is reported in Fig. 1). During the dynamics we can always identify\nthree distinct classes of nodes: bulk, interfacial, and unreached nodes. When the above process takes place on a\nrandom network, in the limit of large network's size N , the overall dynamics is well represented by the temporal\nevolution of some mean-field quantities, the densities of bulk nodes b(t), interfacial nodes i(t), and unreached nodes\nu(t). Obviously, u(t) + i(t) + b(t) = 1 always during the dynamics.\nOn a generic random network, however, the degree is not fixed, the nodes being divided in degree classes. The global\ndensities are replaced by degree-dependent partial densities bk (t), ik (t), and uk (t). The partial density for unreached\nnodes of degree\nP k is defined as the fraction of nodes of degree k that are still unreached at time t. The normalization\nrelation is k P (k)uk (t) = u(t), where P (k) is the degree distribution of the underlying network. The other quantities\nare defined similarly.\nMore in general, one may be interested in situations in which the network is still maximally random (with degree\ndistribution P (k)) but with some degree correlations, expressed by the conditional probability P (k|h) that a node of\ndegree k is linked to a node of degree h. One can also consider the nodes divided in types \u03b1, i.e. discrete or continuous\nstates defined on the nodes. Types are used to create multi-partite networks and to encode some non-topological\nfeature. Another way to account for non-topological properties is that of putting weights on the links, that depend\nonly on the degrees and the types of the extremities. Link weights may account for dynamical properties of the\nprocess, such as the transmissibility of a disease [19]. The internal structure of the population is taken into account\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\ndefining degree-dependent and type-dependent partial densities\nofPu\u03b1\nk (t), ik (t), and bk (t). The global densities are\nP\n\u03b1\nrecovered by averaging over all distributions, i.e. u(t) = \u03b1 P(\u03b1) k P (k)uk (t). In order to simplify the formalism,\nhere on we limit our analysis to single-type undirected random markovian networks [20], that are maximally random\ngraphs completely defined by the degree distribution P (k) and the degree correlations P (k|h).\nAccording to this mean-field approximated description of the processes, the temporal evolution of the partial densities\nsatisfies a system of differential equations of the type,\n\uf8f1\nd\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 dt uk (t) = fu ({uh (t)}, {ih (t)}, t, * * * )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nd\n(1)\ndt ik (t) = fi ({uh (t)}, {ih (t)}, t, * * * )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 d\ndt bk (t) = fb ({ih (t)}, t, * * * ) ,\n\nwhere the arguments of the functions fx (*) depend on the general form of the dynamics described above. For instance,\nfb is not expected to depend on unreached nodes, fu on the bulk nodes, etc. The system is generally coupled and\nnon-linear, and admits an explicit solution only in very special cases.\nIn statistical physics and theoretical biology, continuous mean-field dynamical equations are commonly used to study\nmodels of population dynamics. The dynamical picture emerging from these mean-field models allows to understand\nthe qualitative behavior of complex phenomena occurring in real systems. At the same time, it is worth noting that\nthe rigorous derivation of differential equations for random processes on random graphs has been introduced in the\nmathematic literature only recently, by Wormald [21], and then applied to several problems, including algorithms for\nthe generation of random graphs with a given degree sequence [22] and random k-SAT problems [23]. Wormald's\ndifferential equations method provides a powerful tool to prove rigorous bounds for interesting quantities (e.g. distribution's moments) in discrete-time combinatorial processes. Here we limit our analysis to a qualitative topological\ncharacterization of the emerging degree distribution obtained within a purely mean-field statistical physics approach.\nHowever, a rigorous formalization of the present approach is desirable as well.\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: Sketch representing the evolution of the considered class of dynamical processes. Starting from a single source, the\nnodes of the network are progressively visited. Once the nodes at the interface (grey nodes) have spread the process towards\ntheir still unknown neighbors (white nodes), they are moved to the bulk (black nodes).\n\nA.\n\nSingle-source processes\n\nThe degree distribution P\u0303 (k) of a subnetwork is related to the degree distribution P (k) of the underlying one by\nP\u0303 (k) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nP (l)Q(k|l)\n\n(2)\n\nl=k\n\nwhere P (l) is the degree distribution, that defines the probability of picking up a node of degree l in the original\nnetwork, and Q(k|l) is the conditional probability of observing a node of degree k in the subnetwork if its real degree\nin the complete network is l. In a dynamical framework, the sampling probability depends on the temporal evolution\nof the overall process. At the beginning, the neighborhood of interfacial nodes is mainly composed of unreached ones,\nwhereas in the final stage of the dynamics most of the nodes have already been visited. The probabilities P (l) and\nQ(k|l) are thus replaced by time-dependent quantities Pt (l) and Qt (k|l), that are defined by the evolution rule of the\ndynamical processes itself.\nUsing the properties of the dynamics, Pt (l) can be expressed as the probability of picking up a node of degree l\namong the interfacial nodes of the growing cluster at a time t, i.e. Pt (l) = P (l)il (t)/i(t). Then, the way in which\nthe neighbors of this node are selected and visited depends strictly on the details of the dynamical model. When the\ngrowing cluster has a tree-like structure, a node of degree l has only one incoming edge, and the remaining l \u2212 1 links\nare used to propagate towards unreached neighbors. Let us call \u03c1h the probability to visit a neighbor of degree h of\nan interfacial node of degree l (it is a function of uh (t)), the conditional probability Qt (k|l) becomes\nQt (k|l) =\n\n\u0012\n\nl\u22121\nk\u22121\n\n\u0013 \"X\n\nP (h|l)\u03c1h [uh (t)]\n\nh\n\n#k\u22121 \"\n\n1\u2212\n\nX\n\nP (h|l)\u03c1h [uh (t)]\n\nh\n\n#l\u2212k\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nPutting together these two terms and recalling that the global topology is given by averaging over the whole temporal\nspectrum, we obtain the following expression for the degree distribution P\u03031 (k) of the tree-like structure emerging from\nthe dynamics,\nP\u03031 (k) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nl=k\n\nZ\n\u221e\nX\n1 T\n=\nT 0\nl=k\n\nZ\n\u221e\nX\n1 T\nPt (l)Qt (k|l) dt ,\nT 0\nl=k\n#k\u22121 \"\n#l\u2212k\n\u0013 \"X\n\u0012\nX\nP (l)il (t) l \u2212 1\nP (h|l)\u03c1h [uh (t)]\n1\u2212\nP (h|l)\u03c1h [uh (t)]\ndt ,\nk\u22121\ni(t)\n\nP\u03031 (k, l) =\n\nh\n\n(4)\n\nh\n\nwhere T is the maximum sampling time. In the above equation we have also introduced the joint degree distribution\nP\u03031 (k, l) (of observing a node of degree k with real degree l), that will be useful in the following.\nThe generalizations to multi-type and weighted networks are straightforward once one has correctly considered the\nevolution equations for the partial densities of bulk, interfacial and unreached nodes.

Increasing the number \u03bd of\nsources, i.e. of trees, the degree distribution becomes closer to the original one. A small peak around z is developed because\nof metric correlations. B) Degree distribution P\u0303\u03bd (k) obtained numerically from the recursion relation in Eq. 9 for a Poissonian\nrandom graph of average degree z = 100.\n\nsampling technique (binomial probability) in selecting neighboring nodes is justified by the spreading like character of\nthe dynamics considered here. For different classes of dynamical processes, e.g. threshold processes [18], the selection\nmechanism should be modified.\nB.\n\nMulti-source processes\n\nIt frequently happens that several processes are running at the same time, so that the overall measure is obtained\nmerging several single-source structures. This is indeed the case of Internet's mapping projects, in which single\n(spanning) trees from different source nodes are merged together in order to get more accurate mappings of the\nunderlying topology. A completely different example is provided by the overall infection profile in a population that\nis object of multiple non-interacting disease spreadings (e.g. e-viruses and worms in P2P communities), each one\ngenerating a sort of causal tree.\nIn order to study multi-source processes, and the emerging degree distribution, we put forward an approximated\nmethod based on a simple mean-field argument for the overlap probability of uncorrelated trees. A direct generalization\nof the single source method presented above is somewhat tricky, since in any node one edge per process is used as\nan incoming edge and is not available for spreading. Increasing the number of sources one should take care of all\npossible combinations of these incoming links, that becomes rapidly very complicated. Nonetheless, this approach\nleads to some valuable approximation. Let us consider a process with two sources, and a node of degree l + 1 for\nwhich we fix the incoming edge, so that both trees reach the node from such an edge. Moreover, we assume that the\ntwo sampling processes are completely independent and uncorrelated. With these hypotheses, the observed degree\ndistribution, obtained merging two trees is\nP\u03032 (k + 1) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nP (l + 1)\n\nl=k\n\n1\nT2\n\nZ\n\nT\n\ndt1 dt2\n\n0\n\n\u0013\u0012 \u0013\n\u0013\u0012\nl\nl \u0012\nil+1 (t1 ) il+1 (t2 ) X X l\nm\nl\u2212m\n\u03b4(k \u2212 m \u2212 n + r)\nr\nn\u2212r\ni(t1 )\ni(t2 ) m,n=0 r=0 m\n\n(5)\n\n\u00d7 [\u016b(t1 )\u016b(t2 )]r [\u016b(t1 ) (1 \u2212 \u016b(t2 ))]m\u2212r [\u016b(t2 ) (1 \u2212 \u016b(t1 ))]n\u2212r [(1 \u2212 \u016b(t1 )) (1 \u2212 \u016b(t2 ))]l\u2212m\u2212n+r ,\n\nP\nwhere \u016b(t) = h P (h|l)\u03c1h [uh (t)] and \u03b4(x) is the Kronecker's symbol.

However, one can exploit the picture emerging from Eq. 6 and generalize it to be valid whatever\nthe choice of the incoming edges. Unlabeling the incoming edges and considering them like the other edges discovered\nduring single-source processes, we get the following approximation for the observed degree distribution in a process\nwith two sources,\nP\u03032 (k, l) \u2248 P (l)\n\nl\nl\nX\nX\n\nm,n=1 r=0\n\nB(l, m, n, r)\n\nP\u03031 (n, l) P\u03031 (m, l)\n\u03b4(k \u2212 n \u2212 m + r) ,\nP (l)\nP (l)\n\n(7)\n\nthe sums over m and n start from 1 since we assume that all nodes are discovered, thus the minimum observed\ndegree is 1. Note that even if two consecutive processes are dynamically uncorrelated, the topological and functional\nproperties of the underlying system always introduce some correlations. For instance, in real networks there are very\ncentral nodes that bear a large fraction of the traffic, the so-called backbone nodes. Depending on the process it may\nbe easier or more difficult to traverse these nodes. Again, in the Internet there are administrative policies governing\nlocal routing systems, therefore in some cases it is impossible to visit the entire neighborhood of a node. This kind of\ncorrelations cannot be easily included in the above mean-field analysis. On the other hand, Internet's local correlations\nmay rapidly change in time, as they are affected by traffic congestions and routers' failures; therefore the average\nqualitative behavior of real processes should be close to the uncorrelated one.\nWriting R\u03032 (k, l) = P\u03032 (k, l)/P (l), Eq. 7 can be rewritten\nR\u03032 (k, l) =\n\nl\nl\nX\nX\n\nB(l, m, n, r)R\u03031 (n, l)R\u03031 (m, l)\u03b4(k \u2212 n \u2212 m + r) ,\n\n(8)\n\nm,n=1 r=0\n\nand the merging process can be easily generalized to any number \u03bd of sources exploiting the recursion relation,\nR\u0303\u03bd (k, l) =\n\nl\nl\nX\nX\n\nB(l, m, n, r)R\u03031 (n, l)R\u0303\u03bd\u22121 (m, l)\u03b4(k \u2212 n \u2212 m + r) .\n\n(9)\n\nm,n=1 r=0\n\nP\nThe degree distribution of the network obtained merging \u03bd trees is then given by P\u0303\u03bd (k) = l P (l)R\u0303\u03bd (k, l). Note\nthat Eq. 9 is general and holds, within the validity of the approximation, for any type of process in the class under\nstudy, while the explicit expression of R\u03031 (k, l) as well as the correct form of B(l, m, n, r) depend on the details of the\ndynamics.\nIn the next section, we show how these methods can be applied to the traceroute model that describes the experiments\nused to determine the topology of the Internet.\nIII.\n\nAPPLICATION TO THE INTERNET'S MAPPING TECHNIQUES\n\nThe Internet's topology can be studied at different levels. The most detailed Internet's descriptions are obtained\nat the level of single routers, but coarse grained representations are usually preferred for the possibility of obtaining\na more reliable picture of the system (see Ref. [9] for a simple introduction to the networked representations of the\nInternet). Routers sharing the same administrative policies are divided into Autonomous Systems (AS), that define\nthe most important coarse-grained level of the Internet's topology. The first maps of the Internet were collected\nmainly at the AS level, using empirical data extracted from BGP tables together with those obtained by dynamical\nsampling methods based on traceroute measurements from single source [24, 25, 26]. According to these maps, that\ncollect partial views of the net from some favored points, the Internet should be a very heterogeneous network with\napproximately power-law degree distribution P (k) \u221d k \u2212\u03b3 , and \u03b3 \u2243 2.1 \u00f7 2.4 [25, 26]. Because of the peculiar properties of scale-free networks, this discovery motivated a series of theoretical works in which toy-models of the Internet's\nmapping process were proposed and analysed in order to justify or question this empirical evidence [6, 8, 27, 28].\nIn a traceroute experiment, a given number of probes are sent from a source to a set of target nodes, tracing back\nthe path followed during the exploration. These probes are data packets that follow the same paths normally used\nby information to flow throughout the Internet. Although traffic congestions and local network's policies may cause\nunpredictable path's inflation, the traceroute paths are optimized in order to be the shortest ones between the source\nand the target nodes. Therefore, standard theoretical models of traceroute's explorations assume that the probes\nfollow one of the possible shortest paths between the source and the destination. More precisely, we can include in\nthe path only one shortest path among all equivalent ones (either a priori fixed or randomly chosen), or all of them.\nAll strategies can occur in realistic processes, that is probably a mixture of them, but people usually give special\n\n\f6\n0\n\n10\n\nA)\n\n-1\n\nu(t)\n\n10\n\nu(t)\nuk(t), k = 75\nuk(t), k = 125\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n1\ni(t)\nik(t), k = 75\nik(t), k = 125\n\ni(t)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\nB)\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nt\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFIG. 3: Temporal behavior of the global and partial densities of unreached (A) and interfacial (B) nodes in an homogeneous\nrandom graph with Poisson degree distribution of average degree z = 100. The curves are obtained by numerical integration\nof the system in Eq. 13.\n\nattention to the one with a unique choice of the shortest path between nodes, that clearly brings to the worst overall\nsampling. We will also consider this case.\nA one-to-all traceroute process is thus represented by an iterative algorithm running on a given network, that starting\nfrom a single source generates a spanning tree to all other nodes. Multi-source processes consist in merging different single-source spanning trees. In general, the reliability of traceroute-like sampling methods strongly depends on\nboth the number of sources deployed on the network and the level of degree heterogeneity [8]. In fact, Lakhina et\nal. [27] first showed numerically that sampling from single sources introduces uncontrolled biases and the observed\nstatistical properties may sharply differ from the original ones. More recently, Clauset and coworkers [6, 10] have\npointed out that, because of the particular search procedure, a one-to-all traceroute tree has a power-law degree\ndistribution P\u03031 (k) \u221d k \u2212\u03b1 even if the underlying network is not scale-free. Actually, this was analytically proved only\nfor homogeneous random graphs with fixed or Poisson degree distribution. In this case, the traceroute tree presents\na power-law distribution with exponent \u03b1 = 1 up to a cut-off equal to the average degree z. For networks with\npower-law degree distributions P (k) \u221d k \u2212\u03b3 , they suggested that the observed one should still be power-law but with\na different exponent \u03b1 < \u03b3. Within the same framework, but in partial contrast with this thesis, Cohen et al. [11]\nhave rigorously showed that in case of power-law networks, the bias on the exponent \u03b3 is negligible. Other recent\nstudies, based on mean-field approaches corroborated by numerical simulations, confirm the overall reliability of these\nmapping techniques on scale-free graphs [8, 28]. Nevertheless, the debate on the traceroute process is still open, the\nmain issues concerning the relevance of the biases in single-source processes and the improvements obtained using\nmultiple sources. In the following, we try to address both these subjects using the theoretical approach developed in\nthe previous section.\nThe analytical results mentioned above are actually based on approximated models that partially overlook the dynamical character of the process. The method used in Ref. [6] to study one-to-all traceroutes is based on differential\nequations, but node sampling is essentially static. It assumes that a node of a given degree can appear with the\nsame probability at any temporal step of the process. This is approximately true on homogeneous networks since the\nk (t)\nterm ii(t)\nin Eq. 4 is \u2243 1, but it cannot be extended to the case of heterogeneous networks. The formal approach\nintroduced in Ref. [10] is more general, but it is still based on a uniformly random process, the so-called \"exposure on\nthe fly\" technique. It implicitly assumes a fitness-like variable homogeneously distributed on the \"stubs\" of a network,\nthat plays the role of the time at which a node is explored. We improve this approximation using the dynamical\nmethod exposed in Section II for both single-source and multi-source processes. Obviously the framework becomes\nmore complex and calculations can be performed analytically only in some special cases.\n\n\f7\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\nu(t)\n\n10\n\nu(t)\nuk(t), k = 2\nuk(t), k = 50\nuk(t), k = 100\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\nA)\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1\n\ni(t)\n\ni(t)\nik(t), k = 2\nik(t), k = 50\nik(t), k = 100\n\nB)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nt\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFIG. 4: Temporal behavior of the global and partial densities of unreached (A) and interfacial (B) nodes in a power-law\nrandom graph with exponent \u03b3 = 2.5 and average degree z \u2243 4.5. The curves are obtained by numerical integration of the\nsystem in Eq. 13.\n\nA.\n\nHomogeneous Networks\n\nLet us consider the one-to-all traceroute exploration of an homogeneous random graph with Poisson degree distribution P (k) = e\u2212z z k /k!. The original traceroute dynamics is discrete in time: at each temporal step, an interfacial node\nl is randomly selected to spread out probes towards all its unknown neighbors; then all reached nodes are included\nin the interface, whereas node l is moved to the bulk. A continuous-time approximation is defined grouping together\nN discrete steps and passing to differential equations in the limit of large size N .\nAs the degree distribution is peaked around the average value z, one can safely do the further approximation that all\nnodes behave identically, that is their temporal evolution is described by the mean-field densities u(t), i(t), b(t) [6].\nA selected interfacial node is connected to a unreached node with probability p = z/N , therefore in a temporal step,\np u(t) unreached nodes are visited and one node passes from the interface to the bulk. This process translates in the\nfollowing system of equations [6]\n\uf8f1\nd\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ndt u(t) = \u2212z u(t) ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nd\n(10)\ndt i(t) = +z u(t) \u2212 1 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 d\ndt b(t) = +1 .\n\nThe solution gives u(t) = exp(\u2212zt), i(t) = 1 \u2212 t \u2212 exp(\u2212zt) and b(t) = 1 \u2212 t, with t going from zero to a maximum\nvalue T , that is the first root of i(t) = 0. Moreover, since in the traceroute sampling the probes emerging from the\ninterfacial nodes visit all unreached neighbors, the mean-field probability to reach a node is just \u03c1[u(t)] \u2243 u(t).\nThe network's homogeneity implies that the internal degree profile of interfacial nodes is approximately the same of the\nunderlying network at all times. According to this approximation, for a traceroute spanning tree on an homogeneous\nPoisson graph Eq. 4 reduces to\nP\u03031 (k + 1) \u2243\n\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ\n\u221e\nX\n\u0003l\u2212k\n1 T\nl \u0002 \u2212zt \u0003k \u0002\ndt ,\n1 \u2212 e\u2212zt\nP (l + 1)\ne\nk\nT 0\n\n(11)\n\nl=k\n\nthat is exactly the result obtained by Clauset and Moore [6].\nThe integral in Eq. 11 can be carried out noting that T \u2243 1 (for z \u226b 1) and passing to the variable u = u(t) = e\u2212zt ,\n\n\f8\nwith du = \u2212zudt. Then, we can also easily perform the sum over l,\n\u00151\n\u0013\u0014 k\nu\nl\nF2,1 (k, k \u2212 l, k + 1, u)\nP\u03031 (k + 1) \u2248\nP (l + 1)\nk\nzk\ne\u2212z\nl=k\n#\n\"\u0012 \u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221e\n\u22121\ne\u2212z X z l+1\nl\nl\n\u2212kz\n\u2212z\n\u2212e\nF2,1 (k, k \u2212 l, k + 1, e )\n\u2248\nk\nzk\nl + 1! k\nl=k\n\u0014\n\u0015\nzk\n1\n1\n1 \u2212 e\u2212z \u2243\n,\n\u2248\nzk\nk!\nzk\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u0012\n\n(12)\n\nwhere F2,1 is the hypergeometric function, and the term proportional to e\u2212kz is negligible for sufficiently large values\nof k. As in Ref. [6], we get an observed power-law degree distribution P\u03031 (k) \u223c k \u22121 [6], with a cut-off at k \u2243 z. (It\nis worth to remark that Poisson random networks with average degree large enough to generate a power-law under\nsampling are extremely unlike in realistic systems, i.e. the Internet, community networks, etc. [8].)\nThe results obtained simulating the traceroute model from a single source on a Poisson random graph (e.g. using the\nunique shortest path algorithm proposed in Ref. [8]), confirm the k \u22121 behavior of the observed degree distribution\n(see Fig. 2-A).\nIn Fig 2-A, we also report the observed degree distribution obtained sampling from two or more sources, that clearly\ndepart from a purely power-law shape. The observed weird behavior, neither power-law nor poissonian, in which a\npeak appears at low degree values and moves forward for increasing number of sources, can be easily understood, at a\nqualitative level, using the theory presented in Section II. These peaks are due just to the superposition of power-law\nbehaviors. In single-source experiments, most visited nodes have observed degree one, as they are discovered at the\nend of the process. The majority of them is rediscovered again in the same fashion during the second one-to-all process.\nThus merging two spanning trees the overall distribution presents a peak at degree 2 instead of 1. The same happens\nfor three sources, with a peak at degree 3, and for increasing number of sources. In general, the position of the peak\nkp is not strictly equal to the number of sources \u03bd, but it usually hold kp \u2264 \u03bd. Solving numerically the recursive Eq. 9,\nwe get the results reported in Fig. 2-B. The curves have the same behavior as in the simulations, characterized by a\npeak at increasing degree values, then a decrease up to a cut-off about k \u2248 z. Strikingly, the assumption of complete\nuncorrelation of successive spanning trees seems to be approximately correct for homogeneous random graphs. This is\ntrue up to a certain amount of sources (about 20 in Fig. 2-B), above which the \"metric\" correlations between shortest\npaths are not negligible. At this point, a peak at the original average degree z is developed.\nOur theoretical approach shows that the observed power-laws in one-to-all traceroutes on homogeneous random graphs\nare the result of a kind of convolution over a family of peaked symmetric distributions. This convolution process can\nbe naturally \"inverted\" by increasing the number of observation points. For a large number of sources the tree merging process corresponds to another kind of convolution on the power-laws emerging from single-source experiments\nand produces an unbiased sampling of the original degree distribution. However, the minimal number \u03bd \u2217 of sources\nrequired to obtain an unbiased degree distribution is considerably large in homogeneous networks: from simple arguments and numerical evidences, \u03bd \u2217 \u223c O(z).\nIn general the mean-field approximation on networks can be improved considering degree-dependent mean-field quantities, therefore we consider the system of differential equations describing the dynamics for degree-dependent partial\ndensities of bulk, interfacial and unreached nodes. In uncorrelated networks, it reads\n\uf8f1 d\nP (h\u22121)\nih (t)\n\uf8f4\nh\n\uf8f4\ndt uk (t) = \u2212\nz P (h) i(t) k uk (t) ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nP\nih (t)\nik (t)\nd\nik (t) = + h (h\u22121)\n(13)\ndt\nz P (h) i(t) k uk (t) \u2212 i(t) ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 d\nik (t)\ndt bk (t) = + i(t) ,\n(h)\nP (k|h) is the probability that emerging from an interfacial node of degree h we reach a node\nwhere (h \u2212 1) ih (t)P\ni(t)\nof degree k still unreached at time t. Note that the above system reduces to Eqs. 10 when the network is a regular\nrandom network of degree distribution P (k) = \u03b4k,z . For poissonian networks, the exact time-depending behavior of\nthe partial densities is quite complicated, as evidenced by the curves reported in Fig. 3 obtained solving numerically\nthe system in Eq. 13. In the numerical solution we take initial conditions ih (0) = C0 \u03b4h,z with C0 \u2243 \u2206t, since both\nthe initial condition and the temporal step \u2206t should be of order 1/N in a system of size N .\nThe general behavior can be explained with simple arguments. At the beginning of the process, the probability of\n+\nk\nk (0 )\nhaving a node of degree k at the interface is purely topological, i.e. ii(0\n+ ) \u2243 z .

B) The scaling\nfunction F (see Eq. 14) associated with some universal behavior of ik (t)/i(t) for high-degree nodes.\n\ncan instead be computed knowing that the corresponding behavior of i(t) is approximately linear, i.e. i(t) \u2243 1 \u2212 t,\nand that uk (t) decreases exponentially fast in time. These results, obtained plugging the short times approximation\nduk (t)\ndik (t)\nik (t)\nk\nk (t)\n\u2248 ke\u2212kt \u2212 i1\u2212t\n. For\ni(t) \u2243 z into the equation for\ndt , are verified in the numerics. Hence, from Eq. 13,\ndt\nsufficiently large k, the first term at the r.h.s. can be neglected, thus after integration we get ik (t) \u2243 1 \u2212 t. Therefore,\nk (t)\nthe quantity ii(t)\nis expected to approach the unity for sufficiently large t \u226b t\u2217k , where t\u2217k is the time at which the\nmaximum value of ik (t) is reached. From the previous arguments one expects t\u2217k \u221d 1/k.\nThese simple calculations, and the numerical results reported in Fig. 3, show that the short time behavior of the\nsampling process is not trivial at all. Nonetheless, the degree distributions obtained solving numerically the system in\nEq. 13 and plugging the corresponding partial densities in Eqs. 4 and 9 are in perfect agreement with the analytical\nresults based on the approximation of complete homogeneity (not shown).\nB.\n\nHeterogeneous Networks\n\nThe degree inhomogeneity is instead expected to play an important role in the exploration of networks with skew\nand fat-tailed degree distributions, in which the dynamical sampling of nodes is far from being a uniform process.\nThough to obtain the exact form of partial and global densities it is necessary to solve the evolution equations\nexplicitly, that is in general very difficult, the qualitative behavior of these quantities for large degree values (l \u226b z)\ncan be deduced with some approximate argument. We will show that the tail of the degree distribution of a power-law\nrandom graph is sampled with negligible bias, even in single-source experiments. This is mainly due to the fact that\nhigh degree nodes arrive at the interface of the process almost immediately, and their neighbors are fairly sampled\nwith a probability that depends only weakly on the dynamics.\nAt the beginning of the process, nodes with large degree are preferentially sampled, i.e. il (t)/i(t) \u2243 l/z, implying\nthat the number of unreached hubs rapidly decays to zero. At this point, almost all high degree nodes are at the\ninterface of the process, il (t) varies slowly, and the sampling among high degree nodes inside the interface becomes\nalmost uniformly random (i.e. hubs of degree l are picked with probability P (l)). Hence, for sufficiently large times\nl (t)\nis expected to become independent of the degree l. Solving numerically Eqs. 13,\nand degrees l \u226b z, the quantity ii(t)\nl (t)\nwe find that, for t \u226b 0, ii(t)\n\u221d t\u2212\u03b2 , with a cut-off close to the final sampling time T and the exponent \u03b2 depending\non the details of the degree distribution (not only on \u03b3). The numerical results presented in Fig. 5 suggest a scaling\nl (t)\nfunction for ii(t)\nof the type\n\n\"\u0012 \u0013 #\n1/\u03b2\nl\nl\nil (t)\n,\n\u2248 F t\ni(t)\nz\nz\n\n(14)\n\u22121/\u03b2\n\nwith F (x) \u221d x\u2212\u03b2 when x \u226b 1 and F (x) \u2248 1 when x \u226a 1. The scaling form is correct up to a time Tl \u223c T (l/z)\n,\nat which the quantity vanishes. Note that for a system of size N , and power-law degree distribution of exponent\n\u03b3, the maximum degree scales as lmax \u223c N 1/(\u03b3\u22121) . Since the temporal step of the dynamics (integration step) is\n\u2206t \u223c 1/N , a realistic minimum observation time for the above curves is \u2206t1/(1\u2212\u03b3) , that is traced in Fig. 5-A with a\n\n\f10\ndotted vertical line. It is clear that for high-degree nodes the power-law scaling behavior dominates the most of the\ndynamics. The result is surprising since one would expect that, in a power-law network, il (t)/i(t) \u2243 l/z during the\nwhole dynamics. We will see that this behavior is crucial to get an unbiased estimate of the exponent.P\nThe other interesting time-dependent quantity is the probability to visit an unreached node, \u016b(t) = l zl P (l)ul (t).\nAt long times and high degrees l, the quantity ul (t) is non zero only for low degree nodes, so the temporal behavior of\n\u016b(t) is similar to that of u(t). Actually, it seems to decay from 1 with a law that is clearly slower than an exponential\none, but faster than\na power-law. Indeed, if il (t)/i(t) follows a power-law behavior, formally integrating Eqs. 13 one\n\u03b1\ngets \u016b(t) \u223c e\u2212at , with \u03b1 < 1. However, numerical integration does not clarify the possible relation existing between\n\u03b1 and \u03b2.\nPlugging the above results into the sampling integral (Eq. 4), it is actually possible to show numerically that the\nobserved degree distribution maintains the same functional form of the original one, at least for high degree nodes.\nThe comparison between observed degree distribution obtained from simulations and by solving numerically the\nsampling equations are reported in Fig. 6. The qualitative behavior is the same: the traceroute sampling on powerlaw random graphs reproduces the original degree distribution without any significative bias.\nSome further insights on the reason of this result can be obtained with the following rough argument. Let us consider\nthe sampling formula\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ\n\u221e\nX\n1 T il+1 (t)P (l + 1) l\n[\u016b(t)]k [1 \u2212 \u016b(t)]l\u2212k dt\n(15)\nP\u03031 (k + 1) \u2243\nk\nT 0\ni(t)\nl=k\n\nand approximate it for l \u226b z considering that 1) during most of the dynamics the quantity ik (t)/i(t) assumes the\nscaling form t\u2212\u03b2 , and 2) the binomial probability can be approximated by a gaussian peaked around its maximum,\ni.e. \u016b\u2217 \u223c k/l. A rough estimate can be done performing\nat the saddle-point or, in an equivalent\nR the gaussian integral\nP\nway, recalling a property of Dirac delta functions, i.e. f (t)\u03b4(g(t))dt \u2248 i f (ti )/|g \u2032 (ti )|, where ti are the zeros of g(t)\nand g \u2032 (ti ) is the derivative of the function g in these points. For large k and l, g(t) \u2248 l\u016b(t) \u2212 k, thus |g \u2032 (t)| \u221d l| d\u016b\ndt |tl\n(in which tl is the time at which \u016b(tl ) \u2243 u\u2217 \u2243 k/l for given values of k and l). Putting all ingredients together, the\nsampling formula becomes\nP\u03031 (k + 1) \u2243\n\n\u221e\nX\nl=k\n\nP (l + 1)\n\n1 t\u2212\u03b2\nl\n,\nl + 1 | d\u016b\ndt |t\n\n(16)\n\nl\n\n\u03b1\n\nSince \u016b(t) \u223c e\u2212at , the derivative is proportional to k/l times some power-law in time, we get\nP\u03031 (k + 1) \u221d\n\n\u221e\nX\nl=k\n\n\u0014\n\u0015 1\u2212\u03b2\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b1\n1\nl\n.\nP (l + 1) log( )\nk\nk\n\n(17)\n\nFor large degree we can neglect the logarithmic contributions in the sum over l, finding P\u03031 (k) \u221d k \u2212\u03b3 .\nAccording to this result, the degree distribution of the spanning tree emerging from one-to-all traceroute samplings\nof a scale-free graph (with exponent between 2 and 3) is qualitatively the same of that of the underlying network, at\nleast for high degree nodes. The result is in agreement with a recent analysis by Cohen and coworkers [11], in which\nsome rigorous bounds for the traceroute biases in power-law networks are obtained using the exposure technique.\nWe believe that the general picture describing the behavior of traceroute-like processes could be extracted from the\npresent approach in a much easier way than from the \"exposure on the fly\" method. Moreover, the framework can be\nstraightforwardly extended to study, at least numerically, the effects of other relevant parameters, and correlations.\nIn these perspective our approach can be considered as a benchmark that could be useful in the problem of network\ninference [30] and bias reduction [31].\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe study of the interplay between topological and dynamical properties of networks is of primary interest in the\ncurrent research on complex systems. With the present work, we introduce in this framework a general method to\ninvestigate the topological properties of growing clusters that are dynamically defined by a given class of spreading\nprocesses and algorithms. These are processes that starting from a single source span the whole network, traversing\nall nodes only once. The temporal evolution is defined by means of a system of differential equations for the (partial)\ndensities of bulk, interfacial, and unreached nodes.\nOur approach, that allows to compute analytically or numerically the degree distribution of the emerging tree-like\n\n\f11\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\nP\u03bd(k)\n\n10\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n10\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-3\n\nB)\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\nA)\n\n-5\n\norig.\n\u03bd=1\n\u03bd=2\n\u03bd=3\n\u03bd=5\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nP\u03bd(k)\n\norig.\n\u03bd=1\n\u03bd=2\n\u03bd=3\n\u03bd=5\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nk\n\n2\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\nk\n\nFIG. 6: A) Degree distribution P\u0303\u03bd (k) of the network produced by merging together \u03bd spanning trees generated by one-to-all\ntraceroutes algorithms on a power-law random graph of size N = 104 , average degree z \u2243 4.5 and exponent \u03b3 \u2243 2.5.

As the sampling rate depends on the dynamical properties themselves, the degree distribution\nof the emerging subnetwork may differ considerably from that of the original network. The generalization to study\nmultiple-source processes is also discussed, at least in the approximation that the overall structure is obtained merging\ntogether collections of independent single-source processes.\nA natural application of the method presented here consists in the analysis of the dynamical sampling of networks.\nWe have provided a deeper insight in the qualitative behavior of traceroute-like processes, shedding light on the\ndynamical mechanism at the origin of the observed topology. The reasons for the different sampling accuracy observed\nin homogeneous and heterogeneous networks should be now clear. In particular, we have shown that on homogeneous\nnetworks,\n\u2022 in a single source sampling, the network is observed to have a power-law degree distribution with exponent \u22121\nup to a cut-off about the original average degree z;\n\u2022 increasing the number of sources destroys the power-law behavior, but a fair sampling requires about O(z)\nsources;\n\u2022 \"metric\" correlations (that can be associated to the betweenness centrality of nodes) favor a better sampling of\nthe local topology for increasing number of sources.\nIn contrast, on heterogeneous networks,\n\u2022 high-degree nodes are preferentially sampled at the beginning of the process, and with higher accuracy (in this\ncase high-degree nodes are essentially those with highest betweenness);\n\u2022 in single-source experiments, power-law degree distributions are sampled with negligible biases;\n\u2022 the overall sampling of the degree distribution becomes very accurate with just few sources.\nWe believe that a good understanding of these kind of processes is fundamental in order to improve the performances\nof current dynamical sampling techniques applied to technological networks such as the Internet and the Web.\nAs mentioned in the Introduction, there are other dynamical processes that can be described using the present\napproach, from the epidemic spreading, to broadcast trees and search techniques. We just mention a couple of cases\nthat may find further developments. One consists in a recently proposed model of search in social networks, in which\nthe search efficiency decays with the distance [32]. Let us consider an uncorrelated homogeneous random network, on\nwhich we perform a distance dependent snowball search such that the probability to visit a still unreached neighbor\n\u2212\u03b2\nof an interfacial node is \u03b8(t) \u221d (t + A) , with \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1). The corresponding global density is obtained solving the\ndu(t)\nequation dt = \u2212z\u03b8(t)u(t). The limit in which \u03b2 \u2192 1 is particularly instructive, since the global density decreases\nmuch slower than an exponential. Performing the calculations, u(t) \u223c A/(A + t) and the emerging tree presents a\ndegree distribution P\u03031 (k) \u2248 k \u22122 up to a cut-off around z. The example shows how easy can be to find processes that\n\n\f12\ngenerate power-law degree distributions out of exponential networks.\nThe second relevant example concerns epidemic-like spreading phenomena. Here the system of differential equations\ngoverning the dynamics is the celebrated susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model [33], in which unreached nodes\nare identified with susceptible nodes, interfacial nodes with infected ones and the bulk nodes correspond to removed\nindividuals. In analogy with the traceroute dynamics, we can write a system of first-order differential equations\ngoverning the temporal evolution of partial densities [34]. The fundamental difference between the two dynamics is\nthat in the traceroute model at each time step the algorithm chooses an interfacial node to sample its neighbors, while\nin the SIR model all infected nodes have a fixed probability to spread the virus to their neighbors (with spreading rate\n\u03bb). However, for small values of \u03bb (above the percolation threshold) the topological structure is still tree-like and can\nbe analyzed as in Section II. When different transmission properties (e.g. degree-dependent and distance-dependent\nrates \u03bb) are taken into account, the growing infection region might display very non-trivial topologies. At the same\ntime, the knowledge of the topological structure of an infection's outbreak may be relevant for the design of more\nappropriate immunization strategies.\nFrom a general point of view, the present formalism can be extended to study (at least numerically) the effect of\ndegree-degree correlations or quenched disorder, that have not been considered here but play an important role in all\nreal experiments.\nIn conclusion, we expect that analyses like the one performed in this paper will allow to get a better understanding\nof the functional interplay between a network and the dynamical processes evolving on it.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author is grateful to A.
