In\ndetail, the neutral- (NC) to charged-current (CC) crosssection ratios [3]\nR\u03bd =\n\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\u0304\n\u03c3N\n\u03c3N\n\u03bd\u0304\nC (\u03bd\u03bc N \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc X)\nC (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc N \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc X)\n,\nR\n=\n\u03bd (\u03bd N \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 X)\n\u03bd\u0304 (\u03bd\u0304 N \u2192 \u03bc+ X)\n\u03c3CC\n\u03c3\n\u03bc\nCC \u03bc\n\nhave been measured to an accuracy of about 0.2% and\n0.4%, respectively. In addition, the quantity\nR\u2212 =\n\n\u03bd\n\u03c3N\nC (\u03bd\u03bc N \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc X) \u2212\n\u03bd (\u03bd N \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 X) \u2212\n\u03c3CC\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bd\u0304\n\u03c3N\nC (\u03bd\u0304\u03bc N\n\u03bd\u0304 (\u03bd\u0304 N\n\u03c3CC\n\u03bc\n\n\u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc X)\n,\n\u2192 \u03bc+ X)\n\nas proposed by Paschos and Wolfenstein [4], has been considered. As a central result, the NuTeV collaboration has\ntranslated their measurements of R\u03bd/\u03bd\u0304 and R\u2212 into values\nfor the on-shell weak mixing angle, sin2 \u03b8W = 1\u2212m2W /m2Z ,\nwhich can be viewed as independent (but rather indirect) determinations of the W- to Z-boson mass ratio. The\nNuTeV result on sin2 \u03b8W is, however, about 3\u03c3 away from\nthe result obtained from the global fit [5] of the Standard\nModel (SM) to the electroweak precision data.\nIt was pointed out [6] that the inclusion of electroweak\nradiative corrections, which influences the result significantly, is based on a single calculation [7] only 1 and that\na\n\nin collaboration with S. Dittmaier and W. Hollik\nElectroweak radiative corrections were also investigated in\nRefs. [8], where in the numerical evaluation several approxi1\n\na careful recalculation of these corrections would be desirable. In this work we summarize a recent publication [1]\ndescribing such a calculation of the O(\u03b1) electroweak corrections to NC and CC deep-inelastic neutrino scattering\noff an isoscalar target. Apart from a different set of parton\ndensities and input parameters the most important difference between our calculation and the result of Ref. [7]\nlies in the treatment of mass singularities due to collinear\nradiation of a photon from external charged particles.\n\n2 Lowest-Order Results\nWe consider the NC and CC parton processes\nNC:\n\n\u03bd\u03bc (pl ) + q(pq ) \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc (kl ) + q(kq ),\n\u2212\n\n\u2032\n\nCC: \u03bd\u03bc (pl ) + q(pq ) \u2192 \u03bc (kl ) + q (kq ),\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere in Eq. (1) the generic label q stands for all light\nquark and antiquark flavours (including charm) and in\nEq. (2) it stands for the quarks d, s, \u016b, c\u0304 (q \u2032 represents\nall CKM-allowed light final-state quarks). Additionally we\nconsider the processes with all particles replaced by their\nantiparticles. With the usual Bjorken scaling variable x,\nneglecting all fermion masses where it is consistently possible, the squared partonic centre of mass energy s is given\nby\ns = 4E 2 = 2xMN E\u03bdLAB ,\nmations were made. Although the input used in Refs. [8] is\nobsolete, the prediction made in these references is relatively\nclose to the results of the analysis presented here.\n\n\f2\n\nK.-P. O. Diener: New Predictions for Electroweak O(\u03b1) Corrections to Neutrino\u2013Nucleon Scattering\n\nup to terms of higher order in the nucleon mass. Hadronic\ncross sections are obtained by convoluting parton-level\ncross sections with iso-averaged parton density functions\n(PDFs) which account for the isoscalar composition of the\nnuclear target.\nAt leading order the approximate relation\nR\u03bd \u223c\n\n20 4\n1\n\u2212 sin2 \u03b8W +\nsin \u03b8W\n2\n27\n\n(3)\n\nand similar relations for R\u03bd\u0304 and R\u2212 permit the translation\nof an experimental determination of the quantities R\u03bd/\u03bd\u0304 ,\nR\u2212 into an indirect measurement of sin2 \u03b8W .\n\n3 Higher-Order Corrections\nThe inclusion of quantum effects in the theoretical prediction can be incorporated in Eq. (3) in terms of a small\nvariation, ultimately relating the relative higher-order corrections to the NC and CC cross sections to a shift in the\npredicted value of the weak mixing angle:\n\u0012 \u03bd\n\u0013\n2\n4\n1\n20\n\u03bd\n\u03b4\u03c3N C\n\u03b4\u03c3CC\n2\n2 \u2212 sin \u03b8W + 27 sin \u03b8W\n\u2206 sin \u03b8W =\n.\n\u2212 \u03bd\n\u03bd\n40\n\u03c3N\n\u03c3CC\n1 \u2212 27\nsin2 \u03b8W\nC\n(4)\nAll parts of our calculation of O(\u03b1) corrections to the\nleading order matrix elements have been performed in\ntwo independent ways, resulting in two completely independent computer codes. Both loop calculations are carried out in 't Hooft\u2013Feynman gauge and are based on the\nstandard techniques for one-loop integrations as, e.g., described in Refs. [9,10]. Ultraviolet divergences are treated\nin dimensional regularization and eliminated using the\non-shell renormalization scheme [9,11] in the formulation\nof Ref. [9]. Infrared (i.e. soft and collinear) singularities\nare regularized by an infinitesimal photon mass and small\nfermion masses. The artificial photon-mass dependence of\nthe virtual and (soft) real corrections cancels in the sum\nof both contributions, according to Bloch and Nordsieck\n[12].\nThe calculation of virtual and real corrections is by\nnow a standard exercise and was in part performed with\nthe help of suitable computer algebra programs like FeynArts [13], FormCalc [14] and FeynCalc [15] and\nin part carried out with independent computer-algebra\nroutines or with recourse to related published work [16].\nAmong the virtual corrections, there are two contributions\nto the NC processes that become numerically delicate in\nthe limit of small momentum transfer in the Mandelstam\nvariable t: the \u03b3\u03bd\u03bc \u03bd\u0304\u03bc vertex correction and the \u03b3Z mixing self-energy. The limit t \u2192 0 is physically well-defined\nin both cases, but the numerical treatment of the corresponding amplitudes deserves some care to ensure proper\ncancellation of powers of t in the form factors against the\nt-channel photon propagator.\nInitial-state mass singularities due to collinear photon\nradiation were subtracted from the real corrections with\na suitably defined MS counterterm (see, e.g., Refs. [16,\n17]), as it is standard procedure in perturbative QCD.\n\nFor the numerical evaluation of the cross sections, however, we adopted leading order CTEQ4L [18] parton densities, which is formally inconsistent with the aforementioned subtraction. Nevertheless, this procedure is acceptable as a full incorporation of O(\u03b1) effects in the DGLAP\nevolution of PDFs and a corresponding fit to experimental data has not yet been performed and the overall effect\nof QED initial-state collinear radiation largely cancels in\nthe radiative corrections to the quantities R\u03bd,\u03bd\u0304 and R\u2212\n(see Eq. (4)). It should be mentioned that our method\nof initial-state mass factorization is fundamentally different from the technique employed in Ref. [7] (called BD\nbelow), where the initial-state mass dependence is left unsubtracted and mq = x mN , the scaled nucleon mass, is\nchosen for the initial-state mass value.\nThere are also \u03b1 ln mq\u2032 and (in the CC case) \u03b1 ln m\u03bc\nterms from final-state radiation. According to the Kinoshita\u2013Lee\u2013Nauenberg (KLN) theorem [19], these terms drop\nout if the final state is treated sufficiently inclusive, i.e. if\nthe cones for quasi-collinear photon emission around the\ncharged outgoing fermions are fully integrated over. This\ncondition is, in general, not fulfilled if phase-space cuts\nat the parton level are applied. In the NuTeV analysis\nan event is discarded unless the energy deposited in the\ncalorimeter lies within certain bounds, which imposes a\ncut on the final-state particles' energies. We have implemented this final-state energy cut in three different ways\nin our theoretical analysis, namely by imposing it either\n(1) on the final-state quark alone, (2) on the final-state\nquark and final-state real photon energy added together\nor (3) on the final-state quark alone except if the real photon is emitted within a cone of 5\u25e6 (in the laboratory frame)\naround the final-state quark. For the first procedure the\nKLN theorem predicts a dependence of our numerical results on the final-state quark mass, in the second case\nthere is some residual dependence on the muon mass. The\nthird method, imposing the cut on the recombined quark\nand photon energy, renders our results independent of any\nfinal-state mass. Although this seems to be a strong argument in favor of the recombination technique, the cut\non the sum of hadronic and photonic energies seems to\nbe most appropriate for a fixed-target experiment where\nall but the energy of neutrinos and muons is deposited\nin a calorimeter. To demonstrate the effect of different\nimplementations of the final-state energy cut we present\nnumerical results for all three procedures described above.\n\n4 Numerical Results\nThe authors of Ref. [7] advocate the on-shell scheme with\nGF , mZ , mW , mH and the fermion masses as independent\ninput parameters. To compare our results, we adopt their\nnumerical values for GF , \u03b1(0), the Z- and Higgs-boson\nmass, the top-quark mass and the electroweak mixing angle sin2 \u03b8W . We supplement these parameters by the missing quark and lepton masses from Refs. [20,21] which are\nquoted within Ref. [7]. Unfortunately it is not completely\nclear, whether, given this set of input parameters, the Wboson mass used in Ref. [7] is calculated from mZ and\n\n\fK.-P. O.

Compilation of results for \u2206 sin2 \u03b8W * 104 calculated\nfrom Eq. (4). We compare the prediction of Ref. [7] with ours in\ndifferent input-parameter and initial-state mass factorization\nschemes (see Section 3 for details) and for different variants of\nfinal-state energy cut (we required Efin > 10GeV). A complete\nspecification of numerical input parameters and more details\non the calculations are found in Ref. [1]\n\n3\n\nSpecifically, our investigation of the factorization-scheme\ndependence for initial-state radiation and of different ways\nto treat photons in the final state reveals that these effects\ncan be as large as the 3\u03c3 difference between the NuTeV\nmeasurement and the Standard Model prediction in the\non-shell weak mixing angle.\nThe NuTeV collaboration estimated the theoretical uncertainty due to missing higher-order effects to 0.00005\nand 0.00011 in \u03b4R\u03bd and \u2206 sin2 \u03b8W , respectively. The results on electroweak corrections presented in this paper\nindicate that these numbers might be too optimistic.\n\nReferences\n\n1. K. P. Diener, S. Dittmaier and W. Hollik, hep-ph/0310364.\n2.
