This incompatibility leads to a number of problems with trying to\nreplace these two branches with a single framework in situations in which the premises of both apply, such as in black holes\nand in the very early universe. This is investigated in this paper via relational particle models (RPM's) [15, 16, 17, 18, 19,\n20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 13, 37, 38, 39]. Sec 1.5 explains the nature of these models.\nFor now, I note that they have a large number of analogies with GR (see [5, 16, 17, 10, 20, 11, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33] and\nespecially [13]), rendering them suitable as toy models for many aspects of the Problem of Time.\nOne notable facet of the Problem of Time shows up in attempting canonical quantization of GR (or of many other\ngravitational theories that carry over likewise background-independent). It is due to GR's Hamiltonian constraint1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(1)\nH := N\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u03c0 \u03bc\u03bd \u03c0 \u03c1\u03c3 / h \u2212 h{Ric(x; h] \u2212 2\u039b} = 0\nbeing quadratic but not linear in the momenta; I denote the general case of such a constraint by Quad.\nThen promoting a constraint with a momentum dependence of this kind to the quantum level gives a time-independent\nwave equation\nb =0,\nH\u03a8\n(2)\nin place of ordinary QM's time-dependent one,\nb\ni\u2202\u03a8/\u2202t = H\u03a8\n\n(3)\n\n[or a functional derivative \u03b4/\u03b4t(x\u03bc ) counterpart of this in the general GR case]. Here, H is a Hamiltonian, \u03a8 is the wavefunction\nof the universe and t is absolute Newtonian time [or a a local GR-type generalization t(x\u03bc )].\nIn the case of GR, in more detail, (2) is a Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation,2\n\u001a\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001b\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b4\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u03b4\u03a8\nb := \u2212' \u221a1\nMN\n(4)\nH\u03a8\n\u2212\n\u03be\nRic(h;\nM]\n' \u03a8 \u2212 hRic(x; h]\u03a8 + h2\u039b\u03a8 = 0 .\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03c1\u03c3\n\u03b4h\nM \u03b4h\nThis suggests, in apparent contradiction with everyday experience, that nothing at all happens in the universe! Thus one is\nfaced with having to explain the origin of the notions of time in the laws of physics that appear to apply in the universe.\nSec 1.3 considers a number of strategies toward explaining this. [Moreover timeless equations such as the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt\nequation apply to the universe as a whole, whereas the more ordinary laws of physics apply to small subsystems within the\nuniverse, suggesting this to be an apparent 'paradox' rather than an actual one.]\n\n1.2\n\nOther Facets of the Problem of Time\n\nOver the past decade, it has become more common to suggest or imply that the Problem of Time is the Frozen Formalism\nProblem. However, a more long-standing point of view [4, 5, 6, 7] (and also argued in favour for in e.g. [8, 10, 12, 13, 14] and\nthe present article) is that the Problem of Time contains a number of further facets. Furthermore, this is not even a case of\nthen having to address around eight facets in succession. For, as Kucha\u0159 found, these facets interfere with each other. He\ntermed this [7] a 'many gates' problem, in which one attempting to enter the gates in sequence finds that they are no longer\ninside some of the gates they had previously entered. I argue that this occurs because the facets arise from a common cause\n\u2013 the mismatch of the notions of time in GR and Quantum Theory \u2013 by which they bear conceptual and technical relations,\nmaking it advantageous, and likely necessary for genuine progress, to treat them as a coherent package rather than piecemeal\nas 'unrelated problems'. To emphasize this common cause, and place the eight principal facets into a more memorable form\n(I have found most theoreticians to be unaware of some facets and/or of their time connotations), I used an even more vivid\nmnemonic [12, 13], depicting the eight facets as the breath, wings, tail, scales and four sets of claws that constitute a single\nentity: the Ice Dragon. This depiction makes it clear that the eight facets inter-protect each other (as Kucha\u0159 observed),\nso that resolving the Problem of Time is altogether harder than addressing each of the facets in succession, let alone just\nunfreezing the equations of physics.\n1 The spatial topology M is taken to be compact without boundary. h\n\u03bc\u03bd is a spatial 3-metric thereupon, with determinant h, covariant derivative\nD\u03bc , Ricci scalar Ric(h) and conjugate momentum \u03c0 \u03bc\u03bd . \u039b is the cosmological constant. Here, the GR configuration space metric M\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = h\u03bc\u03c1 h\u03bd\u03c3\n\u2212h\u03bc\u03bd h\u03c1\u03c3 is the undensitized inverse DeWitt supermetric with determinant M and inverse N\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 itself the undensitized DeWitt supermetric\nh\u03bc\u03c1 h\u03bd\u03c3 \u2212 h\u03bc\u03bd h\u03c1\u03c3 /2. In this paper, b c is a portmanteau of function dependence ( ) in finite theories such as particle mechanics\nR or minisuperspace\nand functional dependence [ ] or mixed function-functional dependence ( ; ] in infinite theories such as field theories. I use S dS for the integral\nover space, including the finite case, for which this is taken to be a multiplicative 1.\n2 The inverted commas indicate that the Wheeler-DeWitt equation has, in addition to the Problem of Time, various technical problems, including\nA) regularization problems \u2013 not at all straightforward for an equation for a theory of an infinite number of degrees of freedom in the absense of\nbackground structure, while the mathematical meaningfulness of functional differential equations is open to question. N.B. this is not an issue in\nthe specific examples in this paper as these are for a finite number of degrees of freedom.\nB) There are operator-ordering issues, which this paper's toy models do exhibit an analogue of [40, 13]. These are tied to the number \u03be, and in\nthe relational approach I resolve this [40] by taking the conformal operator-ordering option [41, 42, 43, 44], which is underlied by the relational\nformulation of the action (see Sec 1.5).\n\n1\n\n\fApart from the 'frozen breath', only the 'wings' of the Problem of Observables shall play a recurring theme in the present\narticle. The Frozen Formalism Facet itself has the following addendum.\nHilbert Space/Inner Product Problem, i.e. how to turn the space of solutions of the frozen equation in question\ninto a Hilbert space. In GR, indefiniteness of the kinetic metric prevents use of a Schr\u00f6dinger inner product and then a\nKlein\u2013Gordon type one fails on other grounds [3]. This is a time problem since inner products and unitary evolution are tied.\nWe next require an interlude so as to interpret further facets. GR also has a linear momentum constraint\nb\u03bc \u03a8 := \u22122D\u03c1 h\u03c1\u03bd \u03b4\u03a8/\u03b4h\u03bc\u03bd = 0 ;\nH\u03bc := \u22122D\u03bd \u03c0 \u03bd \u03bc = 0 which becomes, at the quantum level, H\n\n(5)\n\nthis often becomes entwined in technical problems that afflict Problem of Time strategies.\nMany such entwinings (see e.g. the next two Problems below) furthermore specifically concern diffeomorphisms [whether i)\nthe spatial diffeomorphisms associated with the GR momentum constraint itself, ii) the spacetime diffeomorphisms or iii) the\nresult splitting the spacetime diffeomorphisms due to a foliation by spatial hypersurfaces as occurs in canonical approaches to\nGR]. iii) is altogether harder to handle; whilst i) and ii) are both infinite-dimensional Lie groups, in iii) the GR Hamiltonian\nconstraint does not directly account for the diffeomorphisms of ii) that are not present amongst those of i) This is reflected\ne.g. in the Dirac algebra of the GR constraints having not the mere structure constants of a Lie algebra but, rather, structure\nfunctions. At least this algebra does retain the useful property of closing at the classical level without further constraints\nappearing. Additionally, in classical GR, one can foliate spacetime in many ways, each corresponding to a different choice\nof timefunction. This is how time in classical GR comes to be 'many-fingered', with each finger 'pointing orthogonally' to\neach foliation. Finally, classical GR has the remarkable property of being foliation-independent [47], so that going between\ntwo given spatial geometries by means of different foliations in between produces the same region of spacetime, thus giving\nthe same answers to whatever physical questions can be posed therein. Equipped with this knowledge, one can return to the\ndiscussion of the Problem of Time.\nBest Matching Problem: I argued in [13, 37, 14] that this is a more general conceptualization of, and name for, the\nusually-listed Sandwich Problem. The context for this is that, if the theory has g-nontriviality for g the group associated\nwith the linear constraints LinZ [generalization of (5)], then varying with respect to the auxiliary g-variables produces LinZ .\nThe Best Matching Problem is then whether one can solve the Lagrangian form of LinZ = 0 for the g-auxiliaries themselves,\nwhich is a particular form of reduction. This problem is clearly already present at the classical level. It furthermore becomes\nentwined in some of the approaches that start with manipulations at the classical level prior to quantizing.\nFoliation Dependence Problem: for all that one would like a quantization of GR to retain the nice classical property of\nrefoliation invariance, at the quantum level there ceases to be an established way of guaranteeing this property. That this\nis obviously a time problem follows from each foliation by spacelike hypersurfaces being orthogonal to a GR timefunction:\neach slice corresponds to an instant of time for a cloud of observers distributed over the slice. Each foliation corresponds to\nsuch a cloud of observers moving in a particular way.\nFunctional Evolution Problem alias Possibility of Anomalies. This is the quantum-level problem that the commutator\nof constraints is capable of manifesting, involving breakdown of the immediate closure of the constraint algebra that occurs\nat the classical level. Dirac [45] said that one had to be lucky so as to avoid such breakdowns. Note that only some of the\nanomalies that one finds in physics are time-related. However, in the present case of the quantum counterpart of the Dirac\nalgebra of GR constraints, this is a time issue due to what these constraints signify. In particular, non-closure here is a way\nin which the Foliation Dependence Problem can manifest itself, through the non-closure becoming entwined with details of\nthe foliation. [Non-closure is also entwined with the Operator Ordering Problem, since changing the operator ordering gives\nadditional right-hand-side pieces not present in the classical Poisson brackets algebra.]\nMultiple Choice Problem alias Kucha\u0159's Embarrassment of Riches [5]. This is the purely quantum-mechanical\nproblem that different choices of time variable may give inequivalent quantum theories. [The 'riches' are then the multiplicity\nof such inequivalent quantum theories.] Foliation Dependence is one of the ways in which the Multiple Choice Problem can\nmanifest itself. Moreover, the Multiple Choice Problem is known to occur even in some finite toy models, so that foliation\nissues are not the only source of the Multiple Choice Problem. For instance, another way the Multiple Choice Problem can\narise is as a subcase of how making different choices of sets of variables to quantize may give inequivalent quantum theories,\nas follows from e.g. the Groenewold\u2013van Hove phenomenon.\nGlobal Problem of Time alias Kucha\u0159's Embarrassment of Poverty [5]. This is already present at the classical level.\nThe spatial part of this problem consists in the separation into true variables and embedding (space frame and timefunction)\nvariables' having a proneness for being globally impossible, for reasons that closely parallel the Gribov effect in Yang\u2013Mills\ntheory. This proneness to not globally exist explains Kucha\u0159's name for this problem. The temporal part of this problem\nconcerns cases in which such a split can be defined but cannot be indefinitely continued as one progresses along a foliation\n(or simpler models' timefunctions eventually going astray).\n\n2\n\n\fSpacetime (Reconstruction or Replacement) Problem [5, 14]. Internal space or time coordinates to be used in the\nconventional classical spacetime context need to be scalar field functions on the spacetime 4-manifold. In particular, these\ndo not have any foliation dependence. However, the canonical approach to GR uses functionals of the canonical variables,\nand which there is no a priori reason for such to be scalar fields of this type. Thus one is faced with either finding functionals\nwith this property, or coming up with a new means of reducing to the standard spacetime meaning at the classical level.\nThere are further issues involving properties of spacetime being problematical at the quantum level. Quantum Theory implies\nfluctuations are unavoidable, but now that these amount to fluctuations of 3-geometry, they are too numerous to fit within\na single spacetime (see e.g. [2]). Thus (something like) the superspace picture (considering the set of possible 3-geometries)\nmight take over from the spacetime picture at the quantum level. It is then not clear what becomes of causality (or of locality,\nif one believes that the quantum replacement for spacetime is 'foamy' [2]). There is also an issue of recovering continuity in\nsuitable limits in approaches that treat space or spacetime as discrete at the most fundamental level (see e.g. [48]).\nProblem of Beables. This is usually called the Problem of Observables [45, 5, 6, 9], but I follow Bell [49, 50] in ascribing\nmore physical significance to beables than to observables, especially in the context of Quantum Cosmology. I prefer to use\nbeables, or yet other names corresponding to local versions of such concepts, as per Sec 8.2. The Problem of Beables involves\nconstruction of a sufficient set of beables for the physics of one's model; there are then involved in the model's notion of\nevolution. The Problem of Beables was depicted [13] as the 'wings' of the Ice Dragon, due to observables/beables issues\npopping up all over the place in Theoretical Physics, much like that the Ice Dragon suddenly popping up in unexpected\nplaces of the realm through having wings to swiftly and unexpectedly fly there). Though, as we shall see in Sec 2, 'whether\nthe Ice Dragon has wings' remains a debated point.\n\n1.3\n\nA selection of Problem of Time strategies\n\nA) Semiclassical Approach. Perhaps one has slow, heavy 'h' variables that provide an approximate timestandard with\nrespect to which the other fast, light 'l' degrees of freedom evolve [51, 5, 10]. In the Halliwell\u2013Hawking [51] scheme for GR\nQuantum Cosmology, h is scale (and homogeneous matter modes) and the l-part are small inhomogeneities.3 I.e., it is a\nperturbative midisuperspace model. The Semiclassical Approach involves making\ni) the Born\u2013Oppenheimer (BO) ansatz\n\n\u03a8(h, l) = \u03c8(h)|\u03c7(h, l)i ,\n\nii) the WKB ansatz\n\n\u03c8(h) = exp(i S(h)) ;\n\n(6)\n(7)\nin each case one makes a number of associated approximations. [Evoking semiclassicality only makes sense if one's goals are\nsomewhat modest as compared to some more general goals in Quantum Gravity programs. Nevertheless this is still useful\nfor some applications, including the foundations of practical Quantum Cosmology i.e. putting calculations along the lines of\nHalliwell and Hawking's.]\nb = 0. Then, under a number of simplifications, this yields a Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation4\niii) One forms the h-equation, h\u03c7|H\u03a8\n2\n{\u2202S/\u2202h} = 2{E \u2212 V (h)} , where V (h) is the h-part of the potential and E is the total energy.\nOne way of solving this involves doing so for an approximate emergent semiclassical time tem(WKB) (h); this happens to\nbe [21, 13] a recovery of a 'time before quantization' timefunction: the Jacobi\u2013Barbour\u2013Bertotti one [15, 16].\nb = 0. This is a fluctuation equation but it can be recast (modulo further\niv) One then forms the l-equation {1 \u2212 |\u03c7ih\u03c7|}H\u03a8\nem(JBB)\napproximations) into a t\n-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the l-degrees of freedom,\nb l |\u03c7i .\ni\u2202|\u03c7i/\u2202tem = H\n\n(8)\n\nb l is the remaining surviving piece of\nThe emergent time dependent left-hand side of this arises from the cross-term \u2202h |\u03c7i\u2202h \u03c8. H\nb\nH, acting as a Hamiltonian for the l-subsystem. Moreover, the working leading to such a time-dependent wave equation ceases\nto function in the absence of making the WKB ansatz and approximation, which, additionally, in the quantum-cosmological\ncontext, is not known to be a particularly strongly supported ansatz and approximation to make.\nB) Timelessness. A number of approaches take timelessness at face value. One considers only questions of the universe\n'being', rather than 'becoming', a certain state.\nB.1) A first example is the Na\u0131\u0308ve Schr\u00f6dinger Interpretation. (This is due to Hawking and Page [44], though its name\nwas coined by Unruh and Wald [52].) This concerns the 'being' probabilities for universe properties such as: what is the\nprobability that the universe is large? Flat? Isotropic? Homogeneous? One proceeds via considering the probability that the\nuniverse belongs to region R of the configuration space that corresponds to a quantification of a particular such property,\nZ\nProb(R) \u221d\n|\u03a8|2 DQ ,\n(9)\nR\n3 This\n\nis a quantum cosmological explanation for the origin of structure in the universe \u2013 the seeding of galaxies and of CMB inhomogeneities).\nThe connection between quantum-cosmological perturbations and the observed universe is usually via some inflationary mechanism.\n4 For simplicity, I present this in the case of 1 h degree of freedom and with no linear constraints.\n\n3\n\n\ffor DQ the configuration space volume element. This approach is termed 'na\u0131\u0308ve' due to it not using any further features of\nthe constraint equations. Its implementation of propositions is Boolean via how the region enters the integral.\nB.2) The Conditional Probabilities Interpretation [53] goes further by addressing conditioned questions of 'being'. The\nconditional probability of finding B in the range b, given that A lies in a, and to allot to it the value\n\u0001\nA\nA\ntr PB\nb Pa \u03c1 Pa\n\u0001\n,\n(10)\nProb(B \u2208 b|A \u2208 a; \u03c1) =\ntr PA\na \u03c1\nwhere \u03c1 is a density matrix for the state of the system and the PA\na denote projectors. An example of such a question is 'what\nis the probability that the universe is flat given that it is isotropic' ? This approach can additionally deal with the question\nof 'being at a time' by having the conditioning proposition refer to a 'clock' subsystem.\nB.3) Records Theory involves localized subconfigurations of a single instant of time. It concerns issues such as whether these\ncontain useable information, are correlated to each other, and whether a semblance of dynamics or history arises from this\n(which can involve reducing questions of 'becoming' to questions of 'being'). Records Theory is a heterogeneous subject, a\nnumber of different authors advocating different notions of Records Theory are Page [54], Barbour [17] and I [26, 13, 38] (see\nalso the next SSec).\nC) Histories Theory. Perhaps instead it is the histories that are primary, a view brought to the GR context by Gell\u2013Mann\nand, especially, Hartle [55, 56] and subsequently worked on by Isham, Linden, Savvidou and others [58, 57, 59].\n\n1.4\n\nHalliwell's combined approach\n\nSome motivation for this is as follows.\nPro 1) Both histories and timeless approaches lie on the common ground of atemporal logic structures [57, 13].\nPro 2) There is a Records Theory within Histories Theory, as pointed out by Gell-Mann and Hartle [55] and further worked\non by them [60], and by Halliwell and collaborators [61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67]. Thus Histories Theory supports Records\nTheory by providing guidance as to the form a working Records Theory would take. This also allows for these two to be\njointly cast as a mathematically-coherent package (as already illustrated in preceding subsections). As Gell-Mann and Hartle\nsay [55],\nRecords are \"somewhere in the universe where information is stored when histories decohere\".\n(11)\nAnti 1) There is some chance that being more minimalistic than Gell-Mann\u2013Hartle and Halliwell could itself succeed. If one\nalternatively considers records from first principles from which histories are to be derived, as the history collapses to a single\ninstant, path integrals cease to be defined so this kind of decoherence functional is absent from Records Theory.\nPro 3) Histories decohereing is a leading (but as yet not fully established) way by which a semiclassical regime's WKB\napproximation could be legitimately obtained in the first place. Thus Histories Theory could support the Semiclassical\nApproach by freeing it of a major weakness.\nPro 4) The Semiclassical Approach and/or Histories Theory could plausibly support Records Theory by providing a mechanism for the semblance of dynamics [63, 10] (though the possibility of a practically useable such occurring within pure Records\nTheory has not been overruled). Such would go a long way towards Records Theory being complete. N.B. that emergent\nsemiclassical time amounts to an approximate semiclassical recovery [21] of Barbour's classical emergent time [16, 38, 39],\nwhich is an encouraging result as regards making such a Semiclassical\u2013Timeless Records combination.\nPro 5) The elusive question of which degrees of freedom decohere which should be answerable through where in the universe\nthe information is actually stored, i.e. where the records thus formed are [55, 63]. In this way, Records Theory could in turn\nsupport Histories Theory.\nPro 6) The Semiclassical approach aids in the computation of timeless probabilities of histories entering given configuration\nspace regions. This is by the WKB assumption giving a semiclassical flux into each region [63] in terms of S(h) and the\nWigner function (defined in Sec 3). Such schemes go beyond the standard Semiclassical Approach, and as such there may be\nsome chance that further objections to the Semiclassical Approach (problems inherited from the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation\nand Spacetime Reconstruction Problems) would be absent from the new unified strategy.\nPro 7) Halliwell's approach has further foundational value for practical Quantum Cosmology.\nFor details of the parts of Halliwell's program considered in this paper, see Sec 3.\nNote 1) This program does not make further use of the Semiclassical Approach's specific unfreezing moves, for all that it\ndoes use BO-WKB approximations in obtaining various expressions relevant to the Problem of Time.\nNote 2) Halliwell's approach's attitude to observables/beables is a Dirac one (see Sec 2), though he does not for now consider\nthe effect of linear constraints; the present paper's study is the first to consider examples possessing linear constraints.\n\n1.5\n\nOutline of relational particle mechanics (RPM's)\n\nRPM's are whole-universe models, toy models of geometrodynamics, with nontrivial constraints and structure formation.\nThese are suitable for the study of Quantum Cosmology and some Problem of Time aspects. In particular, they are a good\narena for Histories, Records and Semiclassical Approaches, and quite possibly observables/beables based approaches too (a\n4\n\n\fpoint toward which the present paper contributes). RPM's obey the following 'Leibniz\u2013Mach\u2013Barbour' brand of relationalism\n(GR can be cast in a closely parallel form too [68, 13]).\nA physical theory is temporally relational if there is no meaningful primary notion of time for the system as a whole\n(e.g. the universe) [15, 68, 23, 37]. The very cleanest implementation of this is by using actions that are i) manifestly\nparametrization irrelevant, and ii) free of extraneous time-related variables. [E.g. one is not to involve external absolute\nNewtonian time, or the dynamical formulation of GR's 'lapse' variable.] The relational action that implements the above in\nthe case of RPM's is the Jacobi-type action\n\u221a Z\n\u221a\n(12)\nS = 2 ds E \u2212 V ,\nfor ds the kinetic arc element.\nA physical theory is configurationally relational with respect to a group of transformations g if configurations for the\nwhole universe inter-related by a g-transformations are indiscernible [15, 18, 68, 69, 23, 70, 24, 37]. One way to implement\nthis is to use not 'bare' configurations but rather their arbitrary-g-frame-corrected counterparts. This is the only known way,\nwith sufficiently widespread applicability for a relational program to underlie the whole of the classical fundamental physics\n'status quo' of GR coupled to the Standard Model [68]. Moreover, this paper also covers RPM cases for which configurational\nrelationalism is directly implementable.\nThe following constraints arise from these relational postulates. The energy-type constraint\nX\nN\nE :=\np2 /2mI + V (q I ) = E\nI =1 I\n\n(13)\n\nresults from the parametrization-irrelevance of the action. Note that this is purely quadratic in the momenta. On the other\nhand, the zero total angular momentum constraint\nX\nN\nL :=\nqI \u00d7 pI = 0\n(14)\nI =1\nresults from variation with respect to the auxiliaries that indirectly impose the rotational part of the configurational relationalism. In the case of pure-shape RPM, this is accompanied by the zero total dilational constraint\nX\nN\nD :=\nqI * pI = 0\n(15)\nI =1\nthat results from variation with respect to the auxiliaries that indirectly impose the dilational part of the configurational\nrelationalism. Clearly these last two constraints are linear in the momenta.\nBy the purely quadratic form of E the frozen formalism facet of the Problem of Time clearly manifests itself for RPM's.\nThe above is an indirect, eventually Dirac, presentation, but there is also an explicit r-presentation (the coincidence of\nreduced representation [30, 13] \u2013 linear constraints eliminated \u2013 and of mechanics set up directly on the reduced configuration\nspace [23, 24, 13] \u2013 linear constraints never formulated) in dimensions 1 and 2. Here then the only constraint is\nEr := N AB PA PB /2 + V (QC ) = E\n\n(16)\n\nfor configuration space coordinates QA with conjugate momenta PA and configuration space metric MAB with inverse N AB .\n[13] gives 106 similarities and 39 differences between RPM's and geometrodynamics as motivation. RPM's particular midisuperspace features are a notion of clumping/inhomogeneity/structure and possessing linear constraints; both of these features\nare of especial relevance to the foundations of Quantum Cosmology, rendering RPM's as good qualitative toy model for the\nHalliwell\u2013Hawking approach.\n\n1.6\n\nThe status of the Problem of Time facets for RPM's\n\nThe Frozen Formalism Facet for RPM's is present via the purely quadratic dependence of (13) on the momenta.\nThere is (mostly) no inner product problem for RPM's: positive-definite mechanics, so the Schr\u00f6dinger inner product suffices.\nThe Best Matching Problem for RPM's is for 1- and 2-d RPM's, not a problem but rather a resolved situation [23, 24, 13]\nthat opens up extra paths and checks not available for geometrodynamics.\nThere is no Foliation Dependence Problem for RPM's, since the foliation of spacetime/embedding into spacetime meaning\nof GR's Dirac Algebra of constraints is lost through toy-modelling it with rotations (and/or dilations).\nThere is no Functional Evolution Problem for RPM's: these are 'lucky' in Dirac's sense [13].\nThe Multiple Choice Problem for RPM's. This is already present for finite systems [5, 6], and occurs for RPM's much as it\ndoes in minisuperspace [6].\nThe Global Problem for RPM's. This is present (see [13] for details), including, unlike for minisuperspace, RPM's having\nspatial globality issues via RPM's possessing meaningful notions of localization/clumping.\nThere is no Spacetime Reconstruction Problem for RPM's since they have no nontrivial notion of spacetime.\nThe Problem of Beables/Observables for RPM's. This paper shows that in the RPM arena, this is a surmountable problem.\n5\n\n\fIn Isham's words, \"The prime source of the Problem of Time in Quantum Gravity is the invariance of classical GR under the\ngroup Diff(S) of diffeomorphisms of the spacetime manifold S\" [6]. This is a central and physically sensible property of GR,\nand it binds together a lot of the facets of the Problem of Time. It would amount to ignoring most of what has been learnt\nfrom GR at a fundamental level to simply change to a theory which does not have these complications (such as perturbative\nstring theory on a fixed background). Both Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) [71] and the more recent M-theory development\nof String Theory [72] do (aim to) take such complications into account. The extent to which RPM's are valuable models is\nto a large extent bounded by this difference. E.g. Isham and Kucha\u0159 [73] and much of Isham's review [46] involve issues not\ncaptured by RPM's. E.g. 2 + 1 GR [74] and the bosonic string [75] embody more of the character of the diffeomorphisms,\nwith midisuperspace bearing an even closer parallel. From (13), it follows that the Frozen Formalism Facet also occurs for\nRPM's. Nevertheless, RPM's manage to be background-independent within their own theoretical setting. Additionally, the\nvarious RPM counterparts of the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation do not exhibit the well-definedness problems of full GR.\nFinally, Halliwell's approach and RPM's form a tight fit as regards Problem of Time facets and modelling a number of aspects\nof midisuperspace GR (see the Conclusion).\n\n1.7\n\nOutline of the rest of this paper\n\nTypes of beables and resolution of the Problem of Beables are covered in Sec 2. In Sec 3, I summarize and slightly generalize\nHalliwell's 2003 paper [63] (also worked upon by him and Thorwart [62]). This involves Prob(region in configuration space),\nentering decoherence functional via a class operator containing a window function associated with that region. Note that\nthis is a timeless quantity and is computed for now within the semiclassical regime. Moreover, Halliwell's objects O obey\nPoisson brackets {H, O} = 0, for H the model's analogue of the Hamiltonian constraint. This approach has not hitherto been\nconsidered for models with nontrivial linear constraints Lin as well. This paper does so for some simple RPM's. I resolve\nthe Problem of Beables for RPM's in 1- and 2-d in Sec 4. If {Lin, O} = 0 \u2013 the Kucha\u0159 observables/beables condition \u2013 also\nholds, the constructed objects are Dirac observables/beables. I consider the counterpart of the above work of Halliwell in\nRPM's, which have linear constraints, in Secs 5 to 7. As a first route to Halliwell's approach for nontrivial linear constraints/a\nconstruction of Dirac beables, I consider the case in which Kucha\u0159 beables are formally known (Sec 5), exemplifying this\nwith the relational triangle for which this is explicit (Sec 6). As a second route, in Sec 7 I apply the indirect 'g-act g-all'\nmethod that generalizes both group-averaging and the 'best matching' method of Barbour [15, 13]. I do so firstly for the\nsimple case of sharp-edged window functions of Halliwell 2003 [63]. Paper II will cover these things for the softened version\nthat Halliwell presently advocates [66]. In the Conclusion (Sec 8) I also provide some comments on Halliwell's approach and\nanalyse how well it fares as regards the various facets of the Problem of Time and as an implementation of QM propositions;\nI also consider various possible attitudes to environments in the study of RPM's in Appendix A.\n\n2\n\nSome notions of observables/beables\n\nStudy of observables in this sense started with Dirac [76]. [9, 13] include more recent overviews on observables. Bell [49, 50]\nplaced emphasis on conceiving in terms of beables, which carry no connotations of external observing, but rather simply of\nbeing, rendering these more suitable for the quantum-cosmological setting.\nI also note that it is questionable for the Frozen Formalism Problem to have 'primality rights' [14] as regards inducing\nstrategies. There are strategies for each and every facet, and then overall strategy is an n-tuple of strategies to face off as\nmany facets at once as possible. Thus the 'Tempus Ante Quantum, Tempus Post Quantum, Tempus Nihil Est' trichotomy\nof [5, 6] is superseded by a larger set of joint strategies [14]. In the particular case of the Problem of Observables/Beables,\nthree strategies suggested in the literature are delineated below.\n\n2.1\n\nDirac beables\n\nDirac beables [76, 1, 77] alias constants of the motion alias perennials [7, 78, 79] are any functionals of the canonical\nvariables O = D[Q, P] that, at the classical level, have Poisson brackets with all of a theory's constraints {CA } that vanish\n(perhaps weakly [6]),\n{CA , O} = 0 .\n(17)\nThus, for geometrodynamics\n{H(x), O} = 0 , {H\u03bc (x), O} = 0 .\n\n(18)\nA\n\nJustification\nof the name 'constants of the motion' conventionally follows from the total Hamiltonian being Hb\u039b c =\nR\nA\ndS\n\u039b\nC\nfor\nmultiplier coordinates \u039bA , so that (17) implies\nA\nS\ndO[Q(x\u03b3 , t), P(x\u03b3 , t)]/dt = 0 .\n\n(19)\n\nThe quantum counterpart involves some operator form for the canonical variables and commutators |[ , ]| in place of { , }.\nAlternative Frozen Formalism Facet: The operator-and-commutator counterparts of the above are then another\n6\n\n\fmanifestation of the Frozen Formalism Problem of classical canonical GR. [This can be viewed as some sort of 'Heisenberg'\ncounterpart of the 'Schr\u00f6dinger' Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation being frozen.]\nKucha\u0159's Unicorn is a sufficient set of Dirac beables to describe one's theory is termed. This follows from his quotation\n\"Perennials in canonical gravity may have the same ontological status as unicorns \u2013 a priori, these are possible animals, but\na posteriori, they are not roaming on the earth\" [7].\nStrategy 1) then holds that Dirac beables are conceptually necessary; one needs to know them in order to fully unlock\nQuantum Gravity. In the mythological mnemonic, this makes most sense if one imagines one's Unicorn steed to be winged\n(like that of the heroine of a well-known cartoon from the mid-80's), so as to nullify the Ice Dragon itself having wings.\nThe preceding two blocks are based on the following results.\nKucha\u0159 1981 no-go result [80] is for nonlocal objects of the form\nZ\nO = d3 xK\u03bc\u03bd (x\u03b3 ; h\u03bc\u03bd ]\u03c0 \u03bc\u03bd (x\u03b3 ) .\n\n(20)\n\nS\n\nTorre 1993 no-go result [81] (see also [82]) is for local functionals O of h\u03bc\u03bd and \u03c0 \u03bc\u03bd .\nI finally note that for this paper's models, Strategy 1) is implemented via combining the below Strategy 2 and my generalization of the Halliwell construct.\n\n2.2\n\nKucha\u0159 observables/beables\n\nReplace (17) with split conditions\n{Quad, O} = 0 ,\n\n(21)\n\n{LinZ , O} = 0 .\n\n(22)\n\nKucha\u0159 beables [7] are as above except that only their brackets with the linear constraints (22) need vanish.\nStrategy 2) Kucha\u0159 then argued [7] (see also [7, 79]) for only the former needing to hold, in which case I denote the objects not\nby O = K[Q, P] rather than D[Q, P]. Thus, here Kucha\u0159 observables are all. N.B. it is clear that finding these is a timeless\npursuit: it involves configuration space or at most phase space but not the Hamiltonian constraint and thus no dynamics.\nThe downside now is that there is still a frozen quadratic energy-type quantum constraint on the wavefunctions, so that\none has to concoct some kind of emergent time or timeless manoeuvre to deal with this. The Ice Dragon is here rendered\nflightless by 'disarmament treaty': it 'concedes not to have/use its wings' in exchange for 'a number of one's strategies against\nit ceasing to be allowed'.\nBeyond the above-listed literature that this less stringent condition may suffice, I also use it below as a technical half-way\nconcept/construct in the formal and actual construction of Dirac beables.\nAs to particular methods for attaining Kucha\u0159 beables,\n1) Lin is associated with some group g, by which K[Q, P] being g-invariant suffices for K to be Kucha\u0159. In some cases one\ncan find explicit such constructs (see Sec 4 for some examples); I denote a sufficient set of those by KA . If one can solve the\nBest Matching Problem, then this alongside a small amount of canonical workings gives a geometrically-lucid solution to the\nproblem of finding the Kucha\u0159 beables.\n2) In general, one can however indirectly construct such, at least formally, by taking any object A and applying a g-act g-all\npair to it,5 e.g. the group action\n\n\u2192\n\ngg followed by integration over the group g itself,\n\u2192\n\nZ\nO=\ng\u2208g\n\nDg\n\ngg A .\n\n(23)\n\nThis is limited for full quantum gravity by not being more than formally implementable for the case of the 3-diffeomorphisms.\nA further issue here [83] is what is the extent of overlap between kinematical quantization's [46] object selection and selection\nof beables. One's classical notion of beable is in each of the above cases to be replaced with the quantum one tied self-adjoint\noperators obeying a suitable commutator algebra in place of the classical Poisson algebra; this correspondence is however\nnontrivial (e.g. the two algebras may not be isomorphic) due to global considerations [46].\n5 See [13] for a more detailed account of this concept and its scope. It is a group sum/group average/group extremization move, which also\ngeneralizes Barbour\u2013Bertotti's [15] (see also [68, 70]) indirect 'best matching' implementation of configurational relationalism.\n\n7\n\n\f2.3\n\nPartial observables/beables\n\nTrue observables (Rovelli 1991 [84], see also [85]) alias complete observables (Rovelli 2002 [86]) (which at least Thiemann\n[71] also calls evolving constant of the motion) classically involve operations on a system each of which produces a number\nthat can be predicted if the state of the system is known. This conceptualization of observables is closely-related to the above\nDirac observables and should then be contrasted with the following much more cleanly distinct conception.\nPartial observables (Rovelli 1991 [84]) classically involve operation on the system that produces a number that is possibly\ntotally unpredictable even if the state is perfectly known. The physics then lies in considering pairs of these objects which\nbetween them do encode some extractable purely physical information.\nNote that while the above definitions were more or less in place by 1991, the early 1990's and 2000's forms of the Problem of\nTime strategies that use these do themselves in part differ. Quantum-mechanically, each of the above two definitions carry\nover except that the entities whose predictabilities enter the definitions are now quantum-mechanical (and the states are now\ntaken to be specifically Heisenberg ones).\nStrategy 3) In fact it is but partial observables that are necessary. Rovelli and Carlip argued such positions in the early\n1990's, with some earlier roots lying in [1, 53]; for subsequent such positions, see e.g. [86, 9, 87]. Here the Ice Dragon's ever\nhaving possessed wings, and the subsequent need for flighted Unicorns to compensate for this, are held to have always been a\nmisunderstanding of the true nature of beables, which are in fact entities that are commonplace but meaningless other than\nas regards correlations between more than one such considered at once.\nI include this SSec for completeness and comparison; this paper considers strategies 2 and then 1.\n\n2.4\n\nHalliwell proto-beables\n\nBringing this work of Halliwell's into the discussion at this point is my suggestion. This is an alternative to Rovelli's\napproaches, being rather part of the Dirac\u2013Kucha\u0159 'plot-arc'.\nHalliwell proto-beables are what I term quantities that obey (22) and not necessarily (21), or possibly the QM counterpart\nof this statement. They are therefore the complement of Kucha\u0159 beables, so that\nKucha\u0159 AND Halliwell \u21d2 Dirac.\nMoreover, Halliwell supplies a specific construct for a family of these, beginning from6\nZ +\u221e\nA(q, q0 , p0 ) =\ndt \u03b4 (k) (q \u2212 qcl (t)) .\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nIt is important to treat the whole path rather than segments of it, for, the endpoints of segments contribute non-negligible\nright-hand-side terms to the attempted commutation with H. This and a further implementation at the quantum level in the\nform of class operators (see below) is conceptually strong: its reparametrization-invariance implements temporal relationalism\n[37], the constructs are reasonably universal and have a clear meaning in terms of propositions. [Though in this last sense,\nit would appear to require extension at least to its phase space counterpart.]\nA limitation is that so far Halliwell's approach has only been done for cases with no linear constraints LinZ . Thus the RPM\narena is a suitable place in which to further investigate Halliwell's approach, since that has both constraints and a nice\namount of solvability for the Problem of Beables (Sec 4), though we should first understand the context of Halliwell's work\nitself, to which we next turn.\n\n3\n\nOutline of Halliwell 2003 approach\n\nThis approach of Halliwell's [63] (partly with Thorwart [62]) involves, in conceptual outline, \"life in an energy eigenstate\".\nI.e. a timeless approach, albeit framed within Histories Theory, done semiclassically, and, as I further exposit in the present\npaper, with connections to some approaches to the Problem of Beables.\n\n3.1\n\nClassical preliminary\n\nHalliwell begins by considering probability distributions, firstly on classical phase space, w(q, p) and then at the semiclassical\nlevel. For the classical analogue of energy eigenstate,\n0=\n\n\u2202w\n= {H, w} ,\n\u2202t\n\n(26)\n\n6 I use bolds as configuration space vectors, and what I present is a slight generalization of Halliwell's presentation, as is suitable for N -particle\nand furtherly relational particle models that I move on to cover in subsequent Secs.\n\n8\n\n\fso w is constant along the classical orbits. Halliwell considers expressions for\nPR := Prob(classical solution will pass through a configuration space region R) .\n\n(27)\n\nThis can be taken to be motivated by Mackey's idea [88] that physics should concern propositions about the physical objects\nand their properties. This was taken up by Isham and Linden [57] in the context of Histories Theory and conjectured to be\nuniversal to whichever formulation of physics/Problem of Time strategy [13]. See Secs 3.4 and 8.2 in the Conclusion for more\nabout this.\nNote 1) Such propositions can then be considered via probabilities such as the above.\nNote 2) Some propositions require the phase space extension of the above [89].\nHalliwell evokes fR (q) as the characteristic function of the region R, and makes use of the phase space function (25). [I use\ngeneral configuration space and phase space coordinates here, with dim(q) = k , in contradistinction to his part-implicit\n1-particle in dimension d type notation, due to the N -body and relational directions taken in the present article.]\nZ\nZ\nZ +\u221e\nZ +\u221e\n\u0001\ndt \u03b4 (k) q \u2212 qcl (t) = Dq fR (q) A(q, q0 , p0 ) ,\ndt fR (qcl (t)) = Dq fR (q)\nThen Prob(intersection with R) =\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(28)\nthe 'amount of t' the trajectory spends in R. Note that I am not just reproducing [63] here, but also explicitly expressing\nthe totality of the working in terms of a generalized coordinate system of a generalized (arbitrary-signature) Riemannian\nconfiguration space geometry. This is in anticipation of this paper's later workings.\n\u0012Z +\u221e\n\u0013\nZ Z\nThen\nPR =\nDp0 Dq0 w(q0 , p0 ) \u03b8\ndt fR (qcl (t)) \u2212 \u000f .\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(29)\nHere, the \u03b8-function serves to mathematically implement the restriction the entirety of the phase space that is being\nintegrated over to that part in which the corresponding classical trajectory spends time > \u000f in region R. \u000f is some small\npositive number that tends to 0, included to avoid ambiguities in the \u03b8-function at zero argument. Next, as previously stated,\nthe given A commutes with H.\nAn alternative expression is for the flux through a piece of a {k \u2013 1}-dimensional hypersurface within the configuration space,\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\ndqcl (t) (k)\nP\u03a3 = dt Dp0 Dq0 w(q0 , p0 )\nD\u03a3(q) n * M *\n\u03b4\nq \u2212 qcl (t) = dt Dp0\nD\u03a3(q0 ) n * p0 w(q0 , p0 ) , (30)\ndt\n\u03a3\n\u03a3\nthe latter equality being by passing to q0 := qcl (t) and p0 := pcl (t) coordinates at each t. Here also M is the configuration\nspace metric. The first form of (30), via the cancelling out its of dt's, manifests reparametrization-invariance (and thus\ntemporal relationalism).\n\nFigure 1: Halliwell's approach considers fluxes through pieces of hypersurfaces \u03a3 within configuration space q.\n\n3.2\n\nSemiclassical working\n\nThe last alternative has further parallel [90] at the semiclassical level with the Wigner function [91] (see also [92, 93]).\nThis is a QM phase space distribution function. It is but a quasiprobability distribution because it can take negative values;\nthe preceding three references deal in detail with its physical interpretation. To give the reader a conceptual outline of the\nWigner function, a form for it in the flat-configuration-space K-dimensional form in the Cartesian case is\nZ Z\n1\ndK y h\u03c8(q + y|exp(2i y * q)|\u03c8(q \u2212 y)i .\n(31)\nWig(q, p) = K\n\u03c0\nThis set-up is such that its integral over p gives |\u03c8(q)|2 and its integral over q gives |\u03c8(p)|2 . A distinguishing characteristic\nof the Wigner function is that its equation of motion is very similar to the classical one; in Liouville form, in the Cartesian\ncoordinate case, one has just a correction proportional to (making ~ explicit) ~2 V 000 \u2202 3 S/\u2202p3 for V the potential [93].\n9\n\n\fSemiclassicality helps at this particular point with explicit construction of the class functional in an unambiguous manner\n(this includes [66, 67]'s modifications). Next, starting from the WKB ansatz (7), Halliwell [90] established a further result,\nWig(q, p) \u2248 |\u03c7(q)|2 \u03b4 (K) (p \u2212 \u2207S) ,\n\n(32)\n\nwith p being equal to \u2207S at the purely classical level (as per Hamilton\u2013Jacobi theory). Then (based on [44, 90, 94])\nZ\nZ\nP\u03a3semicl \u2248 dtem\nD\u03a3(q) n * \u2207S |\u03c7(q)|2 .\n\n(33)\n\n\u03a3\n\nHalliwell's treatment continues within the standard framework of decoherent histories. The key step for this continuation is\nthe construction of class operators, which uplifts a number of features of the preceding structures.\n\n3.3\n\nClass operators\n\nClass operators, which I denote by CR , concern Prob(enters a region R of configuration space); CR refers to an \u03b1 comprising\nof those histories that involves crossing over into region R.7 Halliwell's versions [63, 66, 67] use integrals over time to resolve\nthe issue of compatibility with the Hamiltonian constraint.\nMathematical implementation of class operators. One cannot use the most obvious\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\nCR (qf , q0 ) =\n\nZ\n\nZ\nd\u03bb exp(\u2212iE\u03bb)\n\ndtfR (q(t)) \u2212 \u000f\n\nDq(t)exp(iS[q(t)]) \u03b8\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n!\n\n\u03bb\n\n(34)\n\n0\n\n(whose E-factor' here comes from [62] assuming the Rieffel inner product [63]) because of non-commutation with H.\nHowever, the 'sharpened' version,\n]\nCR\n=\u03b8\n\n\u0012Z\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0013\ndtfR (q(t)) \u2212 \u000f P (qf , q0 ) exp(iA(qf , q0 )) ,\n\n(35)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nis satisfactory, both conceptually and as regards commutation with H. The cofactor of \u03b8 above is the standard semiclassical\napproximation to the unrestricted path integral. The nature of the prefactor P is described in [62] and references therein.\nThis is not the end of the story since (35) is technically unsatisfactory for the reason given in footnote 7, as resolved in\n[66] (and covered in Paper II). However, the above form does suffice as a conceptual-and-technical start for RPM version of\nHalliwell-type approaches and amounting to an extension of them to cases including also linear constraints.\n\n3.4\n\nDecoherence functionals\n\nThe decoherence functional is of the form\nDec(\u03b1, \u03b10 ) =\n\nZ\n\nZ\nDq\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b10\n\nDq0 exp(i{S[q(t)] \u2212 S[q0 (t)]}\u03c1(q0 , q00 ) .\n\n(36)\n\nClass operators are then fed into the expression for the decoherence functional:\nZ Z Z\nDec(\u03b1, \u03b10 ) =\nDqf Dq0 Dq0f C\u03b1] (qf , q0 ) C\u03b1] 0 (q0f , q00 )\u03a8(q0 )\u03a8(q00 ) .\n\n(37)\n\nThe decoherence functional can be recast in terms of the influence functional [96] as\nZ Z Z\n0\nDec(\u03b1, \u03b1 ) =\nDqf Dq0 Dq00 C\u03b1] (qf , q0 )C\u03b1] (qf , q00 )F(qf , q0 , q00 )\u03a8(q0 )\u03a8\u2217 (q00 ) .\n\n(38)\n\nThen, if [62]'s conditions hold (involving environment-system interactions), the influence functional F takes the form (in the\nCartesian case)\nF(qf , q0 , q00 ) = exp(iq * \u0393 + q * \u03c3 * q)\n(39)\nfor q\u2212 := q \u2212 q0 and \u0393\u0393 , \u03c3\u0393\u039b are real coefficients depending on q + q0 alone and with \u03c3 a non-negative matrix. Using\n7 This\n\nis based on the idea of scattering of classical trajectories in the region. There are various versions of class operators as per the distinction\nbetween Hartle and Halliwell versions, below and [66, 67]/Paper II's version. Issues with this are then as follows. i) A slight spreading occurs.\nii) The PR notion is open to difficulties in general due to chaos. iii) Harshness of the \u03b8 function's edges causes a quantum Zeno problem; this is\nresolved by the construction in [66] and Paper II. In fact, via this resolution Prob(does not enter a region R) ends up playing the main role in\nHalliwell's program.\nThis construct is also related to the Mott [95] bubble chamber paradigm. This is also alluded to in Barbour's timeless Records Approach\n[17], however Mott and most of Barbour are set in space, whilst Halliwell's application resides in configuration space itself. Bell [50] covers both\nsituations, being the first to combine Mott's idea with Misner's vision of Cosmology [42] as scattering in (mini)superspace.\n\n10\n\n\fq+ := {q0 + q00 }/2 as well, the Wigner function is\nZ\n1\nWig(q, p) =\nDq exp(\u2212ip * q)\u03c1(q+ + q\u2212 /2, q+ \u2212 q\u2212 /2) .\n{2\u03c0}K\n\u0012Z +\u221e\n\u0013\nZ Z\n\u0001\ng + , p0 )\ndtem fR q+cl \u2212 \u000f Wig(q\nThen\nPR =\nDp0 Dq \u03b8\n0\n\n(40)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(41)\nfor q+cl (t) the classical path with initial data q+\n0 , p0 and Gaussian-smeared Wigner function\nZ\ng + , p0 ) = Dp exp(\u2212 1 {p0 \u2212 p \u2212 \u0393} * \u03c3 * {p0 \u2212 p \u2212 \u0393})Wig(q+ , p0 ) .\nWig(q\n0\n0\n2\n\n(42)\n\nNote 1) As regards the various no-go theorems, I note that the above avoids Kucha\u0159 1981 by not being of form (20) through\n(the field-theoretic generalization of) Halliwell's object being both a t-integral and not just linearly-dependent on the momenta\nvia e.g. the Wigner function portion of it depending on these in general in more complicated ways. It avoids Torre 1993 by\nnot being local in space or time.\nNote 2) Moreover, by involving a t-integral, Halliwell's object is not local in time, which would however be a desirable\nproperty in a practically useable observable.\nNote 3) There may be a region implementation of the propositions problem. The C ] expression's dependence on regions is\nBoolean: R1 OR R2 is covered by fR1 S R2 . However, it is not then clear that this is desirable as regards considering the\nentirety of the quantum propositions and how these combine, as explained in Sec 8.2.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nObservables/Beables for RPM's\nCharacterization of Dirac and Kucha\u0159 cases\n\nFor indirectly-formulated RPM, (17) takes the form\n{H, O} = 0 ,\n\n(43)\n\n{L\u03bc , O} = 0 ,\n\n(44)\n\n{D, O} = 0 .\n\n(45)\n\nand, also, in the pure-shape case,\nThen Kucha\u0159 observables O = K[Q, P] solve (44) for the scaled case, and (44, 45) for the pure-shape case. Dirac observables\nO = D[Q, P] solve (43, 44) for the scaled case and (43, 44, 45) for the pure-shape case.\nThis identification of Kucha\u0159 observables is a useful application of the results of the program [19, 20, 22, 23, 29, 27, 30,\n31, 32] and its antecedents by Kendall [97] and Molecular Physics parallels [98]. This is possible because the Best Matching\nProblem is solved for 1- and 2-d RPM's (whether pure-shape or scaled) by [23, 24, 13]. This occurs in pure-shape RPM\nfor precisely the set of all functionals of the shape variables and the shape momenta, K[S, PS ]. Likewise, the set of Kucha\u0159\nobservables for pure-shape RPM is precisely the set of all functionals of the scale and shape variables and the scale and shape\nmomenta, K[\u03c3, S, P\u03c3 , PS ].\nI can spell out what all of these variables are for pure-shape and scaled RPM's in 1- and 2-d. I first need to introduce\nrelative Jacobi coordinates [99] Ri . These are linear combinations of relative position vectors rIJ = qJ \u2212 qI between particles\ninto inter-particle cluster vectors such that the kinetic term is diagonal. Relative Jacobi coordinates have associated particle\n\u221a\ncluster masses \u03bci . In fact, it is tidier to use mass-weighted relative Jacobi coordinates \u03c1i = \u03bci Ri (Fig 2). The squares of\n\u221a\ni\nthe magnitudes of these are the partial moments of inertia I i = \u03bci |R |2 . I also denote |\u03c1i | by \u03c1i and \u03c1i /\u03c1 by ni for \u03c1 = I\nthe configuration space radius (alias hyperradius in the Molecular Physics literature [100]).\nThe 1-d pure-shape r-configuration spaces are [20] SN \u22122 and suitable shape variables are here the (ultra)spherical angles\n\u0398r\u0304 [29], interpreted as functions of ratios p\nof relative separations.\nE.g. for 4-stop metroland (a universe model consisting of 4\n\u0001\n2\n2\nparticles on a line), these are \u03b8 = arctan \u03c11 + \u03c12 /\u03c13 and \u03c6 = arctan(\u03c12 /\u03c11 ). The shape momenta are then [29, 13, 36]\nD\u03c6 := p\u03c6 = n1 p2 \u2212 n2 p1 = D2 n1 /n2 \u2212 D1 n2 /n1 and D\u03b8 := p\u03b8 .\n\n(46)\n\nThe 2 -d pure-shape r-configuration spaces are [97, 23] CPN \u22122 and suitable shape variables are here the inhomogenous\ncoordinates Zr\u0304 . To interpret these complex coordinates in terms of the N -a-gons, it is useful to pass to their polar forms,\nZr\u0304 = Rr\u0304 exp(i\u03a6r\u0304 ). Then the moduli are, again, ratios of relative separations, and the phases are now relative angles. In the\nspecific case of the scalefree triangle, there is one of each,\ne.g. in coordinates based around the {1,23} clustering, these are\n\u0001\n[22] \u0398 = 2 arctan(\u03c12 /\u03c11 ) and \u03a6 = arccos \u03c11 * \u03c13 /\u03c11 \u03c13 as per Fig 2d). The shape momenta for the N -a-gon are [13, 36]\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u03b4p\u0304q\u0304\nRp\u0304 Rq\u0304\n\u03b4pq\nRp Rq\n\u2217\n\u0398\nPp\u0304R =\n\u2212\nR\n,\nP\n=\n\u2212\nRp Rq \u0398e\u2217p .\n(47)\nq\u0304\ne\np\n1 + ||R||2\n{1 + ||R||2 }2\n1 + ||R||2\n{1 + ||R||2 }2\n11\n\n\fFigure 2: O, + and \u00d7 denote COM(23), COM(12) and COM(34) respectively, where COM(ab) is the centre of mass of particles a and b. a) is\n\n3-stop metroland and b) is 4-stop metroland in Jacobi H-coordinates. c) is triangleland. Here, I furthermore define \u03a6(a) as the 'Swiss army knife'\n(a)\n(a)\n(a) (a) \u0001\nangle arccos \u03c11 * \u03c13 /\u03c11 \u03c13 . d) I provide the 4 particles in the plane layout to make clear what I mean by H-coordinates: these are shaped\nlike the strokes in the letter H, which is then 'squashed' in the 1-d case. The figures' other labels pick out which clustering each coordinate system\nis with respect to; these are dropped in subsequent computations.\n\nThe scalefree triangle subcase [22, 13, 36] can furthermore be expressed in terms of D4 =: p\u0398 := \u0398\u2217 , J =: p\u03a6 := sin2 \u0398 \u03a6\u2217 .\nHere, and more generally, I use J to denote angular momenta. This J , moreover, clearly cannot be an overall angular\nmomentum since L = 0 applies. It is indeed a relative angular momentum [27]:\nJ = I1 I2 \u03a6\u2217 /I = I1 I2 {\u03b82\u2217 \u2212 \u03b81\u2217 }/I = {I1 L2 \u2212 I2 L1 }/I = L2 = \u2212L1 = {L2 \u2212 L1 }/2 .\n\n(48)\n\nThus it can be interpreted as the angular momentum of one of the two constituent subsystems, minus the angular momentum\nof the other, or half of the difference between the two subsystems' angular momenta. That this is indeed a relative angular\nmomentum is also clear from it being the conjugate of a relative angle.\nFor scaled RPM's, the shape-scale split [24] allows for one just to add a 'radial' scale variable to the above sets (though\nthere are other presentations too, see below). In the polar form that makes the split manifest, they are as for the pure-shape\ncase alongside scale \u03c1 (the hyperradius [98] which is the square root of the moment of inertia) and the momentum conjugate\nto this, p\u03c1 = \u03c1\u2217 . For the triangle, one needs I = \u03c12 to place the angular part into standard spherical form. In the Cartesian\nform for N -stop metroland, one has \u03c1i coordinates with conjugate momenta pi = \u03c1\u2217j . The triangle also admits a Cartesian\nform: in terms of Dragt-type coordinates [101, 30],\nDra1 = 2 \u03c11 * \u03c12 , Dra2 = 2|\u03c11\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u03c12 |3 , Dra3 = \u03c121 \u2212 \u03c122 .\n\n(49)\n\nThese coordinates can be interpreted [30] as a measure of anisoscelesness aniso, 4 \u00d7 the mass-weighted area per unit moment\nof inertia of the triangle, and the ellipticity ellip of the base relative to the median (see [30] for more detail). Their conjugates\nare [13, 36]\n(50)\n\u03a0Dra\n= Dra\u2217\u0393\n\u0393\n(for \u0393 taking values 1 to 3) which are rates of change of ellipticity (pure-dilational), area and anisoscelesness (these last two\nare part-dilational and part-rotational).\n\nFigure 3: a) Triangleland at the topological level. b) Triangleland at the metric level. The [ ] basis has E as principal axis and D as second axis.\nOn the other hand, the ( ) basis has D as principal axis and E as second axis. c) Some cap, belt and lune regions with particular physical significance\n[30] are as follows. The caps are of radius \u000f, the belts of width \u03b4 and the lunes are of polar angular width \u03b7. The above are for pure-shape triangles;\nthe scaled counterparts are in each case just the cones over the pure-shape cases. d) The nomenclature I use for dynamically convenient types of\ntriangle. The most physically meaningful great circles on the triangleland shape correspond to the isosceles, regular and collinear triangles. These\nrespectively divide the shape sphere into hemispheres of right and left triangles, sharp and flat triangles, and anticlockwise and clockwise triangles.\n\nI give more detail of triangleland here, since scaled triangleland is the specific example that this paper makes use of. The\nconfiguration space for this in the case of distinguishable particles and in the plain shape case is the sphere, decorated as\n12\n\n\fin Figs 3b) and 3f). The labelled points and edges have the following geometrical/mechanical interpretations. E and \u0112 are\nthe two mirror images of labelled equilateral triangles. C are arcs of the equator that is made up of collinear configurations.\nThis splits the triangleland shape sphere into two hemispheres of opposite orientation (clockwise and anticlockwise labelled\ntriangles, as in Fig 3c). The I are bimeridians of isoscelesness with respect to the 3 possible clusterings (i.e. choices of base\npair and apex particle). Each of these separates the triangleland shape sphere into hemispheres of right and left slanting\ntriangles with respect to that choice of clustering [Fig 3c)]. The R are bimeridians of regularness (equality of the 2 partial\nmoments of inertia of the each of the possible 2 constituent subsystems: base pair and apex particle.) Each of these separated\nthe triangleland shape sphere into hemispheres of sharp and flat triangles with respect to that choice of clustering [Fig 3d)].\nThe M are merger points: where one particle lies at the centre of mass of the other two. S denotes spurious points, which\nlie at the intersection of R and C but have no further notable properties (unlike the D, M or E points that lie on the other\nintersections).\nIt is sometimes also convenient to swap the Dra2 for the scale variable I in the non-normalized version of the coordinates\nto obtain the {I, Dra1 , Dra3 } system. Then a simple linear recombination of this is {I1 , I2 , Dra1 }, i.e. the two partial\nmoments of inertia and the anisoscelesness. This is in turn closely related [27] to the parabolic coordinates on the flat R3\nconformal to the triangleland relational space, which are {I1 , I2 , \u03a6}.\nA physical interpretation for these is that I1 , I2 are the partial moments of inertia of the base and the median, with \u03a6 the\n'Swiss army knife' angle between these (c.f. Fig 2) . They are clearly a sort of subsystem-split coordinates and thus useful\nin applications concerning subsystems [13, 37].\nIn each case, the quantum counterpart involves some operator form for the canonical variables and commutators in\nplace of Poisson brackets. E.g. in the configuration representation the constituent operator variables are the shapes again,\nalongside differential operators for the shape momenta. In the case of the scaled triangle, these have the mathematics of\nthe standard angular momentum operators albeit now with a more general interpretation as relative shape momenta (mixed\nrelative-dilational and relative-angular momenta),\nsin \u03a6 D4 + cos \u03a6 cot \u0398 J and\n\n\u2212 cos \u03a6 D4 + sin \u03a6 cot \u0398 J .\n\n(51)\n\nThere is the further issue use of conserved quantities in preference to/alongside the momenta.\n1) These, or functions thereof, commute also with the Hamiltonian constraint and are thus Dirac beables. They manage this\nvia not encountering an obstruction from the potential in the bracket of O and H.\n2) They feature in the kinematical quantization procedure, making them even more natural at the quantum level. For the\nsphere, these are the SU (2) quantities Si . Here also e.g. for the sphere, \u03a6 and \u0398 are not good operators, it is, rather, the\nunit Cartesian vectors whose squares sum up to 1 that are. In total, one has Si , Dra\u0393 and \u03a0Dra\n\u0393 , forming the algebra\nEucl(3) S R3 , for Eucl(3) the 'Euclidean group' of translations and rotations (of 3-d reduced configuration space) and where\nS denotes semi-direct product.\nThe next simplest example concerns shape quantities and theory conjugate momenta for the quadrilateral and is presented\nin [35, 36], which are built on the kinematical considerations of [34]\nAs regards higher-d RPM's Kucha\u0159 observables, firstly I emphasize that these models are not needed to toy-model\ngeometrodynamics [13]. Secondly, here the Best Matching Problem has a global obstruction to solvability \u2013 one can only\ninvert the higher-d inertia tensor present in the L-constraint if one excludes the collinear configurations. And yet, these\nconfigurations are entirely physical so this localness of procedure is phys unsatisfactory. See Appendix 3.E of [13] for further\ndetail of this second point.\n\n4.2\n\nDirac observables solved for: Strategy 2 resolved\n\nIf one instead adheres to needing the more restrictive subset of complete observables, then one is to ask which functions of\nshape and shape momentum commute with the pure-shape RPM quadratic energy constraint, and which functions of scale,\nshape, scale momentum and shape momentum commute with the scaled RPM quadratic energy constraint.\nA simple partial answer is that in a few cases these include (subsets) of the isometries, i.e. relative angular momenta,\nrelative dilational momenta and linear combinations of these with certain shape-valued coefficients. E.g. this is a direct\nanalogue of the angular momenta forming a complete set of commuting operators with the Hamiltonian operator, provided\nthat the potential is central i.e. itself respecting the isometries of the sphere by being purely radial. Thus for the tower\nof SO(p)-symmetric problems (2 \u2264 p \u2264 n) for N -stop metrolands and triangleland, and its more elaborate counterpart for\nquadrilateralland in [36], we have found some complete observables. These are not, however, generically present i.e. for\narbitrary-potential models. Another answer, at least in some simple models is that Halliwell's class operators comply with\nQuad. For at least some simple g-trivial theories, Halliwell's class operators are Dirac observables, and they or their phase\nspace generalization may provide the complete set of such. See the next 3 Secs for more about this.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nOne way to extend Halliwell's work to constrained theories\nNature of the extensions\n\nExtension 1) I consider the case of linearly-constrained theories that are at least formally reducible. My treatment here\n\n13\n\n\fis purely quadratic/bosonic for simplicity. K is a coordinate vector for configurational Kucha\u0159 beables; these are independent\nand there are the right number r = dim(qr ) of them to span. The complete set of Kucha\u0159 beables are more general:\nfunctionals F [K, \u03a0K ]. Having Kucha\u0159 beables explicitly available has close ties with one's model being reducible; both are in\npractise exceptional circumstances. They do however apply to 1- and 2-d RPM's, which are indeed both reducible and have\nfull sets of Kucha\u0159 beables known (c.f. Sec 6's example). We present an alternative strategy in Sec 7 which, whilst indirect,\nis more widely applicable in cases without reducibility or knowledge of an explicit directly-expressed set of Kucha\u0159 beables.\nFull use of Kucha\u0159 beables would involve the extension of Halliwell's construct to such as phase space regions since these are\ngeneral functionals of Q, and P rather than just of Q.\nAdditionally, I consider a relational whole-universe context for which the following are held to apply.\nExtension 2) Emergent time tem emerges to fill in the role of t; this emergent time is the coincidence of [21] Jacobi\u2013Barbour\u2013\nBertotti time [15, 16] at the classical level and WKB time at the semiclassical level [51].\nExtension 3) Parageodesic principle conformal transformation (PPCT) invariance is held to apply by Misner's argument [42]\nfor conformal invariance as the second selector within DeWitt's family of configuration space recoordinatization-invariant\noperator orderings [41] being grounded in the classical relational whole-universe models' action [40, 13] being held to continue\nto apply at the quantum level. This involves the relational action (12) being manifestly invariant under the internal conformal\ninvariance\n(52)\nds2r \u2192 ds2 = \u03a92 ds2r , E \u2212 V \u2192 {E \u2212 V } = {E \u2212 V }/\u03a92\n(my notation here restricting to the reduced subcase, but this also applying to the minisuperspace GR setting of Misner). I\nnext note that this implies the inverse of the configuration space metric to scale as\n(53)\nNAB \u2192 N AB = \u03a9\u22122 NAB\nand the square-root of the determinant of the configuration space metric to scale as\nq\np\np\n|M | \u2192 |M | = \u03a9r |M | .\n\n(54)\n\nOne next recovers Misner's conformal covariance of the Hamiltonian constraint (or its generalization, Quad). Then taking\nthis to carry over to the quantum level alongside DeWitt's configuration space recoordinatization invariance implies that\ni) the conformal operator ordering (which the preceding identifies as originating from specifically PPCT-invariance),\nNrAB PAK PBK\nfor\n\npromote to a quantum operator\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n4 := \u221a\n\n1\n\u2202\nM r \u2202KA\n\n\u001a\n\n\u221a\n\n4cr := 4r \u2212\n\nM r NrAB\n\n\u2202\n\u2202KB\n\nr\u22122\nRic(M r ) ,\n4{r \u2212 1}\n\n(55)\n\n\u001b\n(56)\n\nr\n.\nthe usual Laplacian corresponding to MAB\nii) The wavefunctions are also then to scale as (see e.g. [102])\n\n\u03a8 \u2212\u2192 \u03a8 = \u03a9{2\u2212r}/2 \u03a8 .\n\n(57)\n\niii) For the physical quantities to be invariant, the corresponding inner product needs a weight function \u03c9 PPCT-scaling as\n\u03c9 \u2212\u2192 \u03c9 = \u03a9\u22122 \u03c9\n(see e.g. [28]), so that, by use of (54, 57, 58)\nZ\nZ\nZ\nDK \u03a8\u22171 \u03a82 \u03c9 = DK\u03a9r \u03a8\u22171 \u03a82 \u03a92{2\u2212r}/2 \u03c9\u03a9\u22122 = DK \u03a8\u22171 \u03a82 \u03c9 .\n\n(58)\n\n(59)\n\nNote that having explicit Kucha\u0159 observables implies reducibility, so that there is then no formal barrier to performing\nthe above PPCT-invariant interpretation of conformally-invariant ordering. This matters insofar as conformally-invariant\nordering does not in general commute with applying linear constraints [13], thus jeopardizing the argument for this ordering\nin all those case in which one cannot explicitly reduce first.\niv) Another ready corollary of (52) [40] is that the emergent time element scales as\ndtem \u2212\u2192 dt\n\nem\n\n= \u03a92 dtem .\n\n(60)\n\nIt then follows as a new result of this paper that fR needs to scale as \u03a9\u22122 so that the overall combination dtfR is PPCTinvariant. The below are also all new to this paper.\nv) If one applies a PPCT to an r-manifold with metric Mab containing an {r \u2013 1}-dimensional hypersurface with metric mab\nand normal naK , then the formula for the induced metric implies that\nmab \u2212\u2192 mab = \u03a92 mab and nKa \u2212\u2192 nKa = \u03a9nKa\n14\n\n(61)\n\n\ffrom which it immediately follows that\np\np\n\u221a\n|m| \u2212\u2192 |m| = \u03a9r\u22121 m and naK \u2212\u2192 naK = \u03a9\u22121 naK .\n\n(62)\n\nvi) If (57) applies to a wavefunction obeying the BO-WKB ans\u00e4tze form (6, 7), then preservation of the physically-significant\nh\u2013l split under PPCT transformations requires it to be entirely the \u03c7(h,l) factor that PPCT-scales,\n\u03c7 \u2212\u2192 \u03c7 = \u03a9{2\u2212r}/2 \u03c7\n\n(63)\n\nsince \u03a9 itself is in general a function of h and l, and so would map S(h) out of the functions of h alone. Likewise it is the\ninner product integrating over the l-coordinates that carries a \u03a9\u22122 factor.\nvii) The outer rather than inner product of two wavefunctions necessitates the same weight function; this will of course be\nused to build density matrices.\nviii) The phase space measure does not PPCT-scale, as a result of the momentum space measure scaling oppositely to the\nconfiguration space one.\nR\nix) Finally, I posit that the classical probability density w is PPCT-invariant, so that DK D\u03a0K w(K, \u03a0K ) is also.\n\n5.2\n\nClassical preliminary\n\nParallelling Halliwell, I begin by considering probability distributions, firstly on classical phase space, w(K, \u03a0K ) and then at\nthe semiclassical level. For the classical analogue of energy eigenstate,\n0=\n\n\u2202w\n= {H, w} ,\n\u2202tem\n\n(64)\n\nso w is constant along the classical orbits. I evoke fR (q) as the characteristic function of the region R, and makes use of a\nphase space function A that is now not just any A but an A based on Kucha\u0159 observables K:\nZ +\u221e\n)\n=\nA(K, K0 , \u03a0K\ndtem \u03b4 (r) (K \u2212 Kcl (tem )) .\n(65)\n0\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThen\n\n{Lin, A(K, K0 , \u03a0K\n0 )} =\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\ndtem {Lin, \u03b4 (r) (K\u2212Kcl (tem ))} ,\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(66)\n{Lin, K} = 0\n\nand\n\n(67)\nbecause the K are Kucha\u0159, so {Lin, f (K)} = 0 by the chain-rule, and so\n{Lin, A(K, K0 , \u03a0K\n0 )} = 0 .\n\n(68)\n\nMoreover, being in terms of a vector of Kucha\u0159 observables does not change the argument by which\n{Quad, A(K, K0 , \u03a0K\n0 )} = 0\n\n(69)\n\n(which Halliwell has already demonstrated to be robust to curved configuration space use). Thus, by (68,69) combined,\n1) (65) are Dirac.\n2) As substantial a set of Dirac observables can be built thus for a theory whose full set of Kucha\u0159 observables are known as\ncould be built for Halliwell's simpler non linearly-constrained theories. To that extent, one has a formal construction of the\nUnicorn. [Though, at the QM level, this role of A is played out again by the class operators instead.]\nMoreover, in the case of 1- and 2-d RPM's, scaled or unscaled, Sec 4 ensures that this is an actual construction for these toy\nmodels' toy Unicorn.\nZ +\u221e\nZ\nZ +\u221e\n\u0001\nNext,\nProb(intersection with R) =\ndtem fR (Kcl (tem )) = DK fR (q)\ndtem \u03b4 (r) K\u2212Kcl (tem )\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\n=\n\nDK fR (K) A(K, K0 , \u03a0K\n0):\n\n(70)\n\nthe 'amount of tem ' the trajectory spends in R; moreover this\nquantity is constructed\nto be PPCT-invariant by iv).\n\u0012Z physical\n\u0013\nZ\n+\u221e\n\u0001\n\u0001\nK\nThen,\nPR = D\u03a0K\n\u03b8\ndtem fR Kcl (tem ) \u2212 \u000f ,\n0 DK0 w K0 , \u03a00\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(71)\nwhich is PPCT-invariant through coming in three factors each of which is PPCT-invariant [by viii) and ix)].\nNote that the window function corresponding to the region R is assumed to fit on a single coordinate system, limiting it to\nbeing somewhat local. This is entirely fine if one is considering small regions (see Sec 6 for more). This also continues to\nwork approximately for compact RCS's like pure-shape RPM examples have (c.f. Fig 3).\n15\n\n\fAn alternative expression is for the flux through a piece of an {r \u2013 1}-d hypersurface within the configuration space,\nZ\nP\u03a3 =\n\ndtem\n\nZ Z\n\nK\nD\u03a0K\n0 DK0 w(K0 , \u03a00 )\n\nZ\n\nd2 \u03a3(K0 ) nK0 *\n\n\u03a3\n\nZ\n=\n\ndtem\n\nZ\n\nD\u03a0K0\n\nZ\n\n\u0001\ndKcl (tem ) (r)\n\u03b4\nK \u2212 Kcl (tem )\nem\ndt\n\nD\u03a3(K0 ) nK0 * \u03a0K0 w(K0 , \u03a0K ) ,\n\n(72)\n\n\u03a3\nem\nthe latter equality being by passing to K0 := Kcl (tem ) and \u03a0K := \u03a0K\n) coordinates at each tem . This is again PPCTcl (t\ninvariant, by v), viii) and ix).\n\n5.3\n\nSemiclassical quantum working\n\nExtension 4): Wigner function in curved space. As well as previous considerations of volume elements, this has the further\nsubtlety that the sums inside the bra and ket are no longer trivially defined. This was resolved by Winter, Calzetta, Habib,\nHu and Kandrup [103], by Fonarev [104] and by Liu and Qian [105] in the case of Riemannian configuration space geometry\nvia local geodesic constructions.\nUnderhill's earlier study [106] works with just affine structure assumed. (In searching for this topic in the literature, it is\nuseful to note that the Wigner function is closely related to the Weyl transformation; see also Sec 2.3 of the review [107].)\nLiu and Qian also extended their work [105] to principal bundles over Riemannian manifolds, thus covering what is required\nto extend Sec 7 in terms of Wigner functions. Because of this, I specifically take 'Wigner functions in curved space' in the\nsense of Liu and Qian when in need of sufficiently detailed considerations. Finally, I emphasize again that Wigner functions\nare only temporary passengers in the present program due to their being used in Halliwell 2003 types implementations of\nclass operators but no longer in Halliwell 2009 ones, by which I keep the account of this SSec's subtleties brief.\nThe preceding alternative expression has further parallel with the Wigner function at the semiclassical level. Next, [90]'s\nstraightforward approximations in deriving (32) locally carry over, so\nWig(K, \u03a0K ) \u2248 |\u03c7(K)|2 \u03b4 (r) (\u03a0K \u2212 \u2207K S)\n\n(73)\n\n(\u03a0K being \u2207K S for classical trajectories). Then Halliwell'-type heuristic move is then to replace w by Wig in (89), giving\nZ\nZ\n\u2207S\nsemicl\nem\n|\u03c7(K)|2 .\n(74)\nP\u03a3\n\u2248 dt\nd\u03a3(K)nK\n\u2207K\n\u03a3\nR\nThis remains PPCT-invariant as the quantum inner product and the classical d\u03a0K w(K, \u03a0K ) both scale equally as \u03a9\u2212r .\n\n5.4\n\nClass operators\n\nThe Halliwell-type treatment continues within the framework of decoherent histories, which I take as formally standard for\nthis setting too. The key step for this continuation is the construction of class operators, which uplifts a number of features\nof the preceding structures. One now uses\n\u0012Z +\u221e\n\u0013\n]\nCR\n=\u03b8\ndtfR (K(t)) \u2212 \u000f P (Kf , K0 ) exp(iA(Kf , K0 )) ,\n(75)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhich, by construction, obeys\n]\n|[Quad, CR\n]| = 0 ;\n\n(76)\n\n]\n|[Lin, CR\n]| = 0\n\n(77)\n\n]\nalso holds as CR\nis a functional of Kucha\u0159 beables. As the cofactor of \u03b8 is some approximand to the quantum wavefunction,\nit PPCT-scales as \u03a9{2\u2212r}/2 .\nAgain, this class operator is not the end of the story since it is technically unsatisfactory, as resolved in [66, 67] (and\nto be covered in Paper II), but the above form serves as a conceptual-and-technical start for RPM version of the work and\nextension to cases with linear constraints, and for the present conceptual, whole-universe and linear-constraint extending\npaper, this is as far as we shall go.\n\n5.5\n\nDecoherence functional\n\nThe decoherence functional is of the form\nZ\nZ\nDec(\u03b1, \u03b10 ) =\nDK\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b10\n\nDK0 exp(i{S[K(tem )] \u2212 S[K0 (tem )]}\u03c1(K0 , K00 )\u03c9d .\n\n(78)\n\nFor this to be PPCT-invariant as befits a physical quantity, it needs to have its own weight \u03c9d , PPCT-scaling as \u03c9d \u2212\u2192\n\u03c9 d = \u03a9\u2212r \u03c9d .

This has one power of \u000f less than for the above example since cap area\n\u221d \u000f2 but belt area \u221d \u000f only. The extra \u000f2 factor can again be explained in terms of peaks and nodes: a nodal plane of\ncollinearity as compared to peaks on all or part of it.\n\n6.3\n\nClass operators\n\nAgain, one uses the modified version, which here takes the form\n\u0012Z +\u221e\n\u0013\n]\nem\nCR = \u03b8\ndtfR (Dra(t )) \u2212 \u000f P (Draf , Dra0 ) exp(iA(Draf , Dra0 )) .\n\n(91)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n|[E, C ] ]| = 0 , |[L, C ] ]| = 0 .\n\nThis obeys\n\n6.4\n\nDecoherence functionals\n\nClass operators are then fed into the expression for the decoherence functional,\nZ\nZ\nDec(\u03b1, \u03b10 ) =\nd3 Dra\nd3 Dra0 exp(i{S[Dra(tem )] \u2212 S[Dra(tem )])}\u03c1(Drain , Dra0in ) ,\n\u03b1\n\ngiving\n\n(92)\n\nDec(\u03b1, \u03b10 ) =\n\nZ Z Z\n\n(93)\n\n\u03b10\n\nd3 Draf d3 Dra0 d3 Dra0f C\u03b1] (Draf , Dra0 ) C\u03b1] 0 (Dra0f , Dra00 )\u03a8(Drain )\u03a8(Dra0in ) .\n\n(94)\nUnder classically insignificant, QM significant environment assumption under which the influence functional is justified,8\nZ Z Z\n0\nDec(\u03b1, \u03b1 ) =\nd3 Draf d3 Dra0 d3 Dra00 C\u03b1] (Draf , Dra0 ) C\u03b1] (Draf , Dra00 )F(Draf , Dra0 , Dra00 )\u03a8(Dra0 )\u03a8\u2217 (Dra00 ) .\n(95)\nThen if [62]'s conditions apply [which they do according to Attitude 3) of Appendix A],\n8 Note however that the eventual target of paralleling [66] differs in not requiring environments, at least for 'larger regions', so not having an\nalternative at this stage is not a long-term hindrance to the present program.

These are functions of the shapes [23, 13, 35]\n(and scale in the scaled RPM) alongside their conjugates the shape momenta [36, 13]. Secondly, I extend this to a resolution\nof the Problem of Dirac Observables for RPM's by use of the class functionals of Halliwell 2003 [63], which commute with\nthe quadratic constraint as well. This also amounts to extending Halliwell's 2003 approach (combined Histories, Records,\nSemiclassical approach) [63] for Quantum Cosmology to models exhibiting all of nontrivial linear constraints, nontrivial\nstructure formation/inhomogeneity along the lines of the Halliwell\u2013Hawking midisuperspace approach [51] and whole-universe\neffects. Whole-universe effects exhibited in this paper include the universe possessing an emergent time and a conformal\ninvariance (which is the same as Misner's [42] but now anchored to the relational form of the action [40, 13]). See [1, 13] for\nmore closed-universe effects exhibited by RPM's. I exemplify the above extension with the concrete example of the relational\ntriangle, using the nice control permitted by the explicitly available and simple Kucha\u0159 beables available in this case. Other\ntheories for which Kucha\u0159 beables are known include theories for which the notion is trivial (e.g. minisuperspace), a few\n19\n\n\fmidisuperspaces such as the cylindrical wave [108], spherically symmetry [109] and some Gowdy models [110]. I also consider\nthe case in which Kucha\u0159 beables are held not to be available, by the indirect g-act, g-all method. This has wider scope\nalbeit it allows for less formal progress in the general case. Passing from classical Kucha\u0159 beables to QM ones requires choice\nof a subalgebra of them that are to be promoted to QM operators.\n\n8.2\n\nProblem of Time position sum-up for Halliwell-type approaches\n\nIn addition to the case for this given in the Introduction, I note that 1) each of the histories, records and semiclassical\napproaches to be combined can be individually studied in the RPM arena (which qualitatively models two midisuperspace\nfeatures). Each of these strategies has some shortcomings, but the three of them together remove a number of each others'\nshortcomings.\n2) Using the RPM arena allows one to operate free of the Foliation Dependence Problem, Functional Evolution Problem,\nSpacetime Reconstruction Problem and Inner Product Problem.\n3) Using the 1- or 2-d RPM arena has the Best Matching Problem generalization of the Sandwich Problem is resolved for\nthem [22, 23, 24]. This allows for the emergent JBB time to be known explicitly, and this is a classical resolution of the FFP\nand also allows for Kucha\u0159 observables to be known. This can be uplifted to a construct for Dirac observables at the classical\nlevel following Halliwell.\n4) The classical emergent JBB time resolution breaks down at the QM level, but can be replaced by the emergent WKB time\nresolution, itself needing justification. Combined schemes such as Halliwell's go toward that.\n5) Thus the combination of Halliwell's approach and RPM's gets round six of the eight facets of the POT.9\nCaveat 1) Halliwell's approach does not deal with the Global POT or the Multiple Choice Problem, both of which still occur\nfor RPM's; the Global POT is harder to deal with at QM level. Some further idea would be needed here, perhaps along\nthe lines of Bojowald et al's fashionables approach [112], or my degradeables parallel [13]. [Fashionables are observables\nlocal in time and space, whereas degradeables are beables that are local in time and space. These are good words for local\nconcepts, viz 'fashionable in Italy', 'fashionable in the 1960's', 'degradeable outside of the freezer' and 'degradeable within\na year' all making good sense. Also, fashion is in the eye of the beholder \u2013 observer-tied, whereas degradeability is a mere\nmatter of being, rather than of any observing.] These are patching approaches: observables/beables, and timefunctions,\nare held to only be valid on certain local patches. In the classical case, one can consider this in terms of coordinate charts\nwith limited ranges of validity; however at the quantum level one is faced with the open question of how to formulate and\ninterpret an analogue of patching for multiple unitary evolutions. Moreover, I point out that the conceptual content of\npatching/fashionables/degradeables apply not only within Rovelli-type partial observables strategies, but also in programs\nwith other attitudes to observables/beables, in particular to Kucha\u0159 and Dirac beables based approaches. At the level of\nKucha\u0159 observables for RPM's, using fashionables/degradeables means that the functionals of the shapes (and scales) and\ntheir conjugates do not need to be valid over the whole of configuration space. Thus a classical resolution of Problem of\nKucha\u0159 beables, that complies with the Global Problem of Time and complies at least somewhat more with the Multiple\nChoice Problem, is in terms of local functions of the shapes that obey suitable differential geometry meshing conditions.\nThe QM part of this (and patching approaches more generally) remains to be resolved; I have however found an arena \u2013\nthe RPM's \u2013 in which to investigate the spatial as well as hitherto considered temporal aspects of the problem. I note\nfurthermore that the class functional (75) is indeed a locally interpretable concept: select a region, so using such a construct\nto solve the Problem of (Dirac) Observables/Beables at the quantum level is indeed compatible with the basic ethos of\nfashionables/degradeables.\nCaveat 2) Moreover, by involving a t-integral, Halliwell's object is not local in time, which would however be a desirable\nproperty in a practically useable observable.\nCaveat 3) Whilst Halliwell's scheme does not a priori use a na\u0131\u0308ve Schr\u00f6dinger inner product, it still does use a na\u0131\u0308ve\nSchr\u00f6dinger-type implementation of propositions by configuration space regions (or maybe a generalization to phase space\nregions). This suffers from probabilities corresponding to regions composing too simply (Booleanly) for one to be able to\nrepresent all QM propositions in such a form. (E.g. quantum propositions may be taken to obey quantum logic [113, 58],\nwhich is nondistributive, unlike the composition of configuration space regions, which is distributive [and elsewise Boolean].)\nThis is immediately obvious for the Na\u0131\u0308ve Schr\u00f6dinger Interpretation [13], but requires further considerations to establish in\nthe case of a Halliwell-type program, due to how having probability 1 for a slice of a flux tube implies probability 1 in other\nslices of the tube. I procede here by taking sections of configuration space; on these, the Booleanness of region composition\nis as clear as for the Na\u0131\u0308ve Schr\u00f6dinger Interpretation. As Fig 4 explains, such sections may not always be available, even\nfor composing regions with flow-evolutions of other regions along tubes, but they are available enough to be able to have\ncounter-examples (cases in which QM propositions do not obey a Boolean algebra but a section is available so as to carry\nout composition of probabilities within Halliwell's scheme).\nOne way out of Caveat 3) is that QM may require modifying such as to obey an intuitionistic logic [114, 115], which is\ndistributive. I also note that regions are conceptually different in this kind of approach (they are now primary themselves\nrather than 'made up of' some notion of points that are held to be primary), so that this possibility lies outside the scope of\nthe present paper. It is also worth mentioning that [in e.g. [53, 57, 13]] proposition\u2013projector association makes better sense\n9 It is for this purpose that I developed this area at the level of understanding concrete models' configuration spaces, classical dynamics and QM\n[22, 23, 27, 28, 29, 30, 24, 31, 32, 13, 35, 36].\n\n20\n\n\fFigure 4: a) Consider now two hypersurface elements \u03a3 and \u03a30 . b) Sometimes there will exist a section S orthogonal to the classical flow that\nincludes both \u03a3 and \u03a30 . Then via (30) or (33), P\u03a3 OR \u03a30 = P\u03a3 S \u03a30 just as for the Na\u0131\u0308ve Schr\u00f6dinger Interpretation. c) However, if \u03a3 and \u03a30\ndo not lie on the same section, it is not directly like in the Na\u0131\u0308ve Schr\u00f6dinger Interpretation. Now one can consider the flow-evolution of region \u03a3,\nsay, so that it lies in a section that extends \u03a30 ; one can now compose \u03a30 and \u03a300 just like one composed in case a). d) Moreover there need not\nalways exist a section that extends \u03a30 whilst also containing a flow evolution image \u03a300 of \u03a3. The construction of counterexamples, however, can\navoid this case. What this case represents is that the composition of Halliwell's implementation is not always reducible to a parallel of the Na\u0131\u0308ve\nSchr\u00f6dinger Interpretation's composition. Sometimes local sections and meshing conditions between them suffice for composition, but this does\nnot always hold either. These non-existences reflect that some flows can be pathological/exhibit breakdowns in well-definedness or smoothness.\n\nthan evoking regions, at the quantum level. This covers e.g. the case of the Isham\u2013Linden approach to Histories Theory\n([58, 57, 59] see also [116]), the Conditional Probabilities Interpretation [c.f. (10)], or Records within Histories theory [55, 61].\nThe main atemporal part of Isham and Doering [115] could also be viewed an underlying structure for Records Theory.\n\n8.3\n\nHalliwell 2009 type extension\n\nExtending Halliwell's 2009 work to the RPM arena mostly concerns defining class operators somewhat differently so as\nto get these to be better-behaved as regards the quantum Zeno effect. In detail, [63] amonnts to using an impenetrable\nbarrier potential whilst [66, 67] corresponds to a slightly penetrable barrier potential. This amounts to the region in question\nbeing taken to contain a potential, with the class operator being the corresponding S-matrix and the slightly penetrable\ncase representing a softening in the usual sense of scattering theory (albeit in configuration space rather than in space).\n[The smoothed-out case manages to avoid the quantum Zeno effect in addition to managing to still be compatible with the\n(quadratic, not for now linear) constraint.] Similar mathematics arises in the arrival time problem of QM [65, 111].\n\n8.4\n\nQuadrilateralland extension\n\nScaled N -stop metrolands RPM's straightforwardly lie already within the Halliwell 2003 scheme. The quadrilateralland\ncounterpart of the present paper is rather more complicated and may be worked out once quantization, the Semiclassical\nApproach and Histories Theory have been considered for that model.\n\n8.5\n\nMore minimalist alternatives\n\nThe Gambini\u2013Porto\u2013Pullin approach [117] is a competitor insofar as it is a timeless/semiclassical combination (their work\nwith Torterolo [118] furthermore combines this with ideas about observables). Thus it is similarly motivated to Halliwell's\napproach and similarly applicable to Problem of Time and other issues in the foundations of Quantum Cosmology. It can\nalso be investigated in the RPM arena. Arce [119] has provided a distinct combined Conditional Probabilities Interpretation\u2013\nsemiclassical scheme.\n\n8.6\n\nConceptual analogy between RPM shapes and LQG knots\n\nThere is a loose conceptual analogy between pure-shape RPM's shapes or scaled RPM's scale-and-shapes (classical resolutions\nof the linear constraints) and LQG's knot states [120] (quantum resolutions of the linear constraints). Loops themselves are\nanalogous to preshapes [i.e. the configurations prior to the main part of the reduction \u2013 Dil(d) but not Rot(d) taken out\nfor RPM's or SU (2) but not Diff(\u03a3) taken out for LQG]. Passing to knot equivalence classes of loops is then analogous to\nthe transformations used in [23, 24, 13] unveil the shape space/relational space variables. However the transformations in\nSec 2 and 3 of [13] for RPM's are purely configuration space manoeuvres, whereas passing to Ashtekar variables is itself a\ncanonical transformation. Thus RPM's fit better the philosophy of the central importance of the configuration space [16, 37]\n(as opposed to phase space or of any 'polarizations' of it that aren't physically configurations). More ambitiously, might\none be able to extend Halliwell's class operator construction to LQG, so as to be able to, at least formally, write down a\n(perhaps partial) set of complete observables as a subset of the linear constraint complying knots? [I.e. a tentative search\nfor a fully-fledged Unicorn.] This goes beyond the currently-known geometrodynamical minisuperspace scope of Halliwell's\nclass operators, but is an interesting direction in which to try to extend this scope; this discussion is further motivated by\n\n21\n\n\fhow Schroeren [121] has recently considered Hartle-type class functions for LQG, and is currently investigating Halliwell-type\ncounterparts.\nAcknowledgements I thank Mr Eduardo Serna, Professor Marc Lachi\u00e8ze-Rey and especially Professor Jonathan Halliwell\nfor discussions (and Jonathan also for pointing out various references and complications).

There is then a fork as to whether to model this with a notion of environment.\nAttitude 1) On the one hand, the 3-particle RPM has hitherto been taken as a whole-universe model. This most ideal\ninterpretation is a lot less robust to assuming existence of additional particles whose contributions are then to be traced over\n(as compared with minisuperspace modelling having little problem with inclusion of an environment since one assumes there\nthat this model sits in some kind of neglected environment of small inhomogeneous fluctuations). The issue then is justifying\nthe latter parts of [63, 62] (or, even more so, the elsewise more correct [66, 67]) in the absense of an environment; this costs us\ne.g. lines (95-99) in the triangleland example. I note however that in the Halliwell 2009 parallel, configuration space regions\nthat are large enough need no environment.10 As such, our next port of call (Paper II) is the RPM counterpart of Halliwell\n2009 rather than further discussions of environment or its lack in the Halliwell 2003 context.\nAttitude 2) Alternatively, study scale alone and use shape as an environment. This suffers from over-simpleness of the original\nsystem, but this is alleviated once one considers the shape perturbations about this.\nAttitude 3) Study a small set of particles (say a triangle of particles) that are taken to dominate over the cloud of other\nparticles, which make small and averaged-out contributions. These other particles are taken to be negligible in terms of most\nof their physical effects, but are still permitted to serve as an environment for decoherence and accompanying approximate\ninformation storage. Even 1 particle's worth of environment can serve as a nontrivial environment [61]. This offers a second\nresolution to 'losing [62]'s environment': arguing that it was hitherto negligible in the study but is nevertheless available at\nthis stage of the study as an environment.\n\nReferences\n[1] B.S.
