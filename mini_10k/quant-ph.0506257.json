During the past decade, significant progress has been made on physical implementation of quantum computation. High-degree quantum\ncoherence has been demonstrated experimentally in systems such as trapped ions [1, 2], nuclear spins [3, 4],\natoms in optical resonators [5], and photons in microwave\ncavities [6]. However, it seems quite difficult to realize a large number of coupled qubits using these systems. Meanwhile, solid-state qubits are of particular\ninterest because of their advantages of large-scale integration, flexibility in design, and easy connection to conventional electronic circuits [7]. Of those, qubits based\non superconducting devices have recently attracted much\nattention [8] as manipulation of quantum coherent states\nbeing successfully demonstrated in a variety of single\nqubits [9, 10, 11, 12, 13] and coupled two-qubit systems\n[14, 15, 16, 17, 18].\n\nmulti-level qubit determined completely by device parameters (DPs) and external control parameters of the\nqubit which we call working parameters (WPs) for simplicity. For instance, inductance (capacitance) of the superconducting flux (charge) qubit is a DP while external\nflux (gate voltage) is a WP. For the multi-level qubit with\ngiven DPs, the gate leakage is sensitive to their WPs and\nthus can be minimized by the use of appropriate WPs.\nConventionally, the leakage is calculated from transition probabilities to all undesired states by numerically solving the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n(TDSE) [20, 21]. However, this kind of dynamic method\n(DM) not only needs complicated numerical algorithms\nbut also a large amount of computational resources. For\ninstance, optimizing the WPs of a many-qubit network\nneeded for a practical quantum computer using DM may\nonly be possible with ad hoc powerful quantum computers in the future. Thus a much faster approach is highly\ndesirable.\nIn this Letter, we propose a very fast method to minimize the leakage of microwave-driven quantum logical\ngates by choosing appropriate WPs in a system of multilevel qubits with their DPs given in prior. We consider\nthe case of weak microwave fields only since strong fields\nusually cause many additional types of intrinsic gate errors and thus should be avoided in general [20]. Our\nmethod is based on an independent transition approximation (ITA) in which transitions in multi-level qubits\nare treated independently. The leakage is estimated using the spectroscopic properties obtained by solving the\neigenvalue equation of and minimized by optimizing the\nWPs of the qubits. The method is applied to minimize\nleakage of controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate implemented\nwith coupled rf superconducting quantum interference\ndevice (SQUID) flux qubits. The result is in good agreement with that obtained from DM. More importantly,\nthe ITA is scalable as the number of qubit n increases\nbecause the ratio of the speed of ITA to that of DM\nscales exponentially as 2n .\n\nHowever, the solid-state qubits demonstrated in experiments so far all have relatively short coherence time and\nhigh probability of gate errors [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,\n17]. One of the causes of these problems is extrinsic gate\nerror arising from interaction between the environment\nand qubits resulting in decoherence, such as dephasing\nand relaxation [8]. Another cause is intrinsic gate error\nresulting from population leakage to undesired states due\nto the typical multi-level structures of solid-state qubits\n[19, 20]. The intrinsic gate error is crucial since it not\nonly contributes to additional decoherence but also determines the ultimate performance of the quantum gates\nand cannot be eliminated by reducing the environment\ncaused decoherence.\nThe leakage of a gate can be characterized quantitatively by summing up the maximum transition probabilities to all undesired states of a multi-level qubit [19, 20].\nIt depends strongly on energy level structure and transition matrix elements, i.e., spectroscopic properties of the\n1\n\n\fA microwave-driven gate is realized via coherent transitions between the computational states of qubits interacting with microwave fields. In general, correlation and\ninterference between transitions cannot be ignored and\ntransition probability can only be computed accurately\nby solving TDSE. However, in weak fields, which is the\ncase considered here, only the transitions between levels\nwith which the microwave field is resonant or nearly resonant are significant. For a given level, if the level spacings\nbetween it and all other levels are sufficiently different,\nthe correlation and interference between the transitions\nfrom this level have negligible effect. Hence, each transition is expected to take place independently and the\ntwo levels involved can thus be treated as if they are\nisolated from the others. For each of the two-level subsystems interacting with a rectangular pulse, the transition probability can be approximated by an analytical expression using the rotating-wave approximation (RWA).\nAssuming the rectangular pulse is \u01eb (t) = \u01eb0 cos (\u03c9t),\nthe interaction between the qubit and the pulse is then\nV (t) = \u2212\u03bc*\u01eb (t), where \u01eb0 and \u03c9 are the amplitude and\nfrequency of the pulse and \u03bc is the dipole moment operator of the qubit. The maximum transition probability\nfrom state i to j in an N -photon process, Pij , is [22]\n\u0001\n2\n(1)\nPij = \u03a92ij / Dij\n+ \u03a92ij ,\n\nponents.PThe leakage of the ith component is defined\nas \u03b7i = k Pik , where Pik is the maximum probability\nof occupying an undesired state k through all possible\nmulti-photon transitions and the sum is over all the undesired states including all non-computational states as\nwell as those computational states to which no transition\nis intended. The leakage of the n-bit gate, \u03b7, is then defined as \u03b7 = max(\u03b71 , \u03b72 , * * * \u03b7M ) which is a function of the\n\u03bd WPs q1 , q2 , * * *, and q\u03bd . The set of WPs, q1opt , q2opt , * * *,\nand q\u03bdopt is obtained by minimizing\nthe leakage of gate,\n\u0001\nnamely, \u03b7 q1opt , q2opt , * * * , q\u03bdopt \u2261 min [\u03b7 (q1 , q2 , * * * , q\u03bd )].\n\nAs an example, we apply ITA to optimize the WPs of\ncoupled rf SQUID flux qubits for CNOT gate. Each rf\nSQUID consists of a superconducting loop of inductance\nL interrupted by a Josephson tunnel junction characterized by its critical current Ic and shunt capacitance C\n[24]. A flux-biased rf SQUID with total magnetic flux \u03a6\nenclosed in the loop is analogous to a \"flux\" particle of\nmass m = C\u03a620 , where \u03a60 = h/2e is the flux quantum.\n2\nThe Hamiltonian is h (x) = p2 /2m+m\u03c9LC\n(x \u2212 xe )2 /2\u2212\nEJ cos (2\u03c0x). Here, x = \u03a6/\u03a60 is the canonical coordinate\nof the \"flux\" particle, p = \u2212i~\u2202/\u2202x is the canonical mo2\nmentum conjugate to x, EJ = ~Ic /2e = m\u03c9LC\n\u03b2L /4\u03c0 2\nis the Josephson coupling energy, \u03b2L \u221a\n= 2\u03c0LIc /\u03a60 is the\npotential shape parameter, \u03c9LC = 1/ LC is the characteristic frequency of the SQUID, and xe = \u03a6e /\u03a60 is the\nnormalized external flux.\n\nwhere, \u03a9ij = 2\u03bcij *\u01eb0 N JN (yij )/yij is the Rabi frequency\nfor the N -photon resonance, Dij = \u2206Eij /~ \u2212 N \u03c9 is the\ndetuning, \u03bcij = hi |\u03bc| ji is the dipole transition matrix\nelement, \u2206Eij = |Ej \u2212 Ei | is the level spacing between\nthe states i and j, JN is the Bessel function of integer\norder N , and yij = dij *\u01eb0 /~\u03c9 with dij = \u03bcjj \u2212 \u03bcii . Note\nthat Pij , \u03a9ij , and Dij depend on the number of photons\nN . In weak fields characterized by \u03a9ij \u226a \u03c9 only transitions with small N are important. Since the leakage\nis calculated from the maximum transition probabilities\nwhich are independent of pulse shape in weak fields [23]\nthe optimized WPs obtained using rectangular pulse are\nalso valid for other pulse shapes.\nFor the microwave-driven gate considered here, the microwave is resonant with a pair of computational states.\nAccording to Eq. (1), the leakage is suppressed if Dij \u226b\n\u03a9ij holds for all unintended transitions. This condition\nmay be satisfied by using sufficiently weak fields and/or\nqubits with proper spectroscopic properties. However,\nthe use of exceedingly weak fields will make the gate very\nslow. Even so the unintended transitions will still cause\nlarge leakage at or near resonance where Dij \u2243 0 and Pij\n\u2243 1 regardless of intensity of the fields. Thus the leakage can be greatly reduced by setting the level spacings\nof the qubits substantially detuned from the microwave\nfrequency and/or the dipole transition matrix elements\nsufficiently small for all unintended transitions.\nTo investigate the leakage in a multi-level qubit, we\nstudy what happens when the microwave acts on each\nof the computational states, which we call a component\nof the gate. For an n-bit gate, there are M = 2n com-\n\nThe coupled rf SQUID qubits comprise two rf SQUID\nqubits: a control qubit and a target qubit coupled via\ntheir mutual inductance M [7, 25]. For simplicity, we\nassume that the two SQUIDs are identical: Ci = C,\nLi = L, and Ici = Ic for i = 1 and 2. The Hamiltonian of the coupled SQUID qubits is H (x1 , x2 ) =\nh (x1 ) + h (x2 ) + h12 (x1 , x2 ), where xi , xei , and h (xi )\n(i = 1 and 2) are the canonical coordinate, normalized\nexternal flux, and Hamiltonian of the ith single SQUID\nqubit and h12 is the interaction between the qubits given\n2\nby h12 (x1 , x2 ) = m\u03c9LC\n\u03ba (x1 \u2212 xe1 ) (x2 \u2212 xe2 ). Here,\n\u03ba = M/L is the coupling constant. Note that each\nSQUID qubit is a multi-level system. The eigenstate\n|n) and eigenenergy En of the coupled qubits are computed by numerically solving the eigenvalue equation of\nH(x1 , x2 ) using the two-dimensional Fourier-grid Hamiltonian method [26]. They are functions of the WPs xe1 ,\nxe2 , and \u03ba for given device parameters L, C, and Ic\n[27, 28]. For weak coupling \u03ba \u226a 1, the eigenstate of\nthe coupled qubits, denoted by |n) = |iji, can be well\napproximated by the product of the control qubit's state\n|ii and the target qubit's state |ji, |n) = |ii |ji. When\nbiased at xe1 , xe2 \u2248 1/2 the potential of coupled SQUID\nqubits have four wells [7, 25]. The lowest eigenstates in\neach of the four wells, denoted as |1) = |00i, |2) = |01i,\n|3) = |10i, and |4) = |11i, are used as the computational\nstates of the coupled SQUID qubits. For SQUIDs with\nL = 100 pH, C = 40 fF, and \u03b2L = 1.2, the energy levels and level spacings versus xe2 and \u03ba are plotted in\nFig. 1(a)\u2212(d), respectively.

The probability of be2\ning in the state |n) is |cn | , from which the maximum\nprobabilities on the undesired states and the leakage\n\u03b7 (xe1 , xe2 , \u03ba) of the CNOT gate are calculated. The results are shown in Fig. 2(b) with the color scale identical\nto Fig. 2(a). To have a more quantitative comparison,\nwe also plot, in Fig. 2(c) and (d), two line-cut figures at\nplaces with the richest structures in Fig. 2(a) and (b).\nThe good agreement between the results of ITA and DM\ndemonstrates the validity of using ITA to minimize the\nCNOT gate leakage.\nOne of the advantages of ITA is that it provides clear\nphysical intuition and insight into the origin of intrinsic gate errors and thus how to reduce the problem by\nselecting appropriate WPs. Furthermore, ITA is orders\nof magnitude faster than DM. For instance, the result\nshown in Fig. 2(a) took less than 3 hours to compute on\na dual-2.8 GHz processor Dell PRECISION 650 workstation while that shown in Fig. 2(b) took more than 300\nhours on the same computer. Denoting \u03c4S and \u03c4T respectively the time needed to calculate the spectroscopic\nproperties of an n-bit gate and that used to compute the\nprobability evolution in DM for each component. The\ntotal times needed to compute the leakage by ITA and\nDM are approximately \u03c4I \u2248 \u03c4S and \u03c4D \u2248 \u03c4S + 2n \u03c4T ,\nrespectively, where the factor 2n is the number of components for the n-bit gate. Hence, \u03c4S < \u03c4T and the\nratio \u03c4D /\u03c4I \u2248 2n \u03b6 increases exponentially with n, where\n\u03b6 \u2261 \u03c4T /\u03c4S . For weak fields, \u03b6 \u226b 1 and the ratio \u03c4D /\u03c4I\nis very large. For example, for the CNOT gate above\n\u03b6 \u223c 25 and \u03c4D /\u03c4I \u223c 100. Thus as the number of qubits\nincreases the optimization of WPs of multi-bit quantum\ngates could become an intractable problem using DM.\nTo demonstrate quantitatively the effect of different\nWPs on intrinsic gate errors, we plot in Fig. 3(a) and\n(b) the population evolution of the computational states\n\nP\n\nn\u2032\n\nenergy levels and level spacings are sensitive to the WPs\nxe2 and \u03ba. When xe2 < 0.49877 or xe2 > 0.50123 in\nFig. 1(a) or \u03ba > 7.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 in Fig. 1(c) the energy level\nstructures become quite complicated. Fig. 1(b) and Fig.\n1(d) also show that in certain regions of the WP space\nthe level spacings become crowded, meaning that they\nare degenerate or nearly degenerate, which may result in\nsignificant intrinsic gate errors.\nControlled two-bit gates can be realized by applying a resonant microwave pulse to the target\nqubit. The interaction between the microwave and\nthe coupled qubits can be written as V (x1 , x2 , t) =\n2\nm\u03c9LC\n[(x2 \u2212 xe2 ) + \u03ba (x1 \u2212 xe1 ) + xm /2] xm ,\nwhere\nxm (t) = xm0 cos (\u03c9t) is the magnetic flux (normalized to\n\u03a60 ) coupled to the target qubit from the microwave with\namplitude xm0 and frequency \u03c9. For the CNOT gate,\na \u03c0-pulse with \u03c9 = \u2206E34 /~, where \u2206E34 = |E4 \u2212 E3 |,\nis used. Populations of the states |10i and |11i are\nexchanged after the \u03c0-pulse only if the initial state is\n|10i or |11i or a linear combination of them. Note that\nin this case in addition to the non-computational states,\nthe undesired states also include the computational\nstates |00i and |01i. Using Eq. (1) and following the\nsteps described above, the leakage of the CNOT gate\n\u03b7 = max(\u03b7|00i , \u03b7|01i , \u03b7|10i , \u03b7|11i ) is calculated. In the\ncalculations, up to 3-photon processes are included. The\nN -photon processes for N > 3 have negligible effects.\nFor the SQUID qubits with the previously given DPs,\nthe leakage is a function of WPs xe1 , xe2 , and \u03ba. In Fig.\n2(a) we plot the leakage of the CNOT gate versus xe2\nand \u03ba for xe1 = 0.499 and xm0 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 . It is shown\nthat the leakage of the CNOT gate is much smaller\nwhen the coupled SQUID qubits are operated around\nxe2 = 0.4997 and \u03ba = 7.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 for xe1 = 0.499.\nTo evaluate the results obtained from ITA, we\nperformed an accurate dynamic calculation by solving the TDSE of the coupled qubits i\u2202cn (\u03c4 ) /\u2202\u03c4 =\n3\n\n\fnumber of qubit n increases. Our calculation also shows\nthat high intrinsic fidelity CNOT gate can be achieved using microwave-driven rf SQUID qubits with properly selected WPs. Although the proposed ITA is only applied,\nas an example, to the rf SQUID qubits, it is also valid\nfor other microwave-driven multi-level qubits. Therefore,\nITA provides a much needed solution for the optimization\nof WPs of multi-bit gates implemented with multi-level\nphysical qubits, for which DM is extremely time consuming or could even become intractable.\nThis work was supported in part by the NSF\n(DMR-0325551) and AFOSR, NSA and ARDA through\nDURINT grant (F49620-01-1-0439).\n\nFIG. 3: Population evolution of the computational states |10i\nand |11i for the CNOT gates with different WPs: (a) xe2 =\n0.49985 and \u03ba = 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 corresponding to the point \"A\" in\nFig. 2(a) [also (b)], and (b) xe2 = 0.49897 and \u03ba = 5 \u00d7 10\u22124\ncorresponding to the point \"B\" in Fig. 2(a) [also (b)].

It is clearly\nshown that inversion from the initial state |10i (|11i) to\nthe final state |11i (|10i) after the \u03c0-pulse is almost complete when operated at the point \"A\" but significantly\nincomplete at the point \"B\". We also computed the population evolution of the coupled qubits with the initial\nstates |00i and |01i using the same microwave pulse. The\nsystem essentially stayed in the initial states for the gate\noperated at the point \"A\" but leaked significantly to the\nnon-computational states for the gate at the point \"B\".\nThe quality of a gate can be described by gate fidelity\nF \u2261 Trace [\u03c1P \u03c1I ], where \u03c1P and \u03c1I are the physical and\nideal density matrices after gate operation and the overline denotes averaging over all possible initial states [30].\nFor the CNOT gates operated at the point \"A\" we obtain FA = 0.9997 which is very close to the ideal CNOT\ngate. In contrast, the gate operated at the point \"B\"\nhas FB = 0.8061 which is too large to be tolerated. Furthermore, at the point \"A\" the gate is about a factor of\nthree faster than that at the point \"B\".\nIn summary, a very efficient method is proposed to\noptimize the WPs of microwave-driven quantum logical\ngates in multi-level qubits based on ITA. In this method,\nthe leakage is estimated accurately from the spectroscopic properties of the qubits and minimized by choosing appropriate WPs. This method is exemplified by\noptimizing the WPs of coupled rf SQUID flux qubits for\nminimal leakage of the CNOT gate. The result is in good\nagreement with that obtained from dynamic calculations.\nCompared to the conventional dynamic method the ITA\nnot only provides physical insight into the origin of gate\nleakage but also reduces the computational time by more\nthan two orders of magnitude for the CNOT gate. Furthermore, since the ratio of the speed of ITA to that of\nDM scales exponentially as 2n the ITA is scalable as the\n\n4\n\n\f"}
