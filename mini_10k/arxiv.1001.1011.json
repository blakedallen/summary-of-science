On the other hand, Randall-Sundrum (RS)\nbraneworld models have been actively discussed as a novel cosmological framework. Interestingly, the geometrical set up of braneworlds is quite similar to that\nin the AdS/CFT correspondence. Hence, it is legitimate to seek a precise relation\nbetween these two different frameworks. In this lecture, I will explain how the\nAdS/CFT correspondence is related to the RS braneworld models. There are two\ndifferent versions of RS braneworlds, namely, the single-brane model and the twobrane model. In the case of the single-brane model, we reveal the relation between\nthe geometrical and the AdS/CFT correspondence approach using the gradient expansion method. It turns out that the high energy and the Weyl term corrections\nfound in the geometrical approach correspond to the CFT matter correction found\nin the AdS/CFT correspondence approach.

We also\ndiscuss dilatonic braneworld models from the point of view of the AdS/CFT correspondence.\n\n1 Introduction\nIt is believed that string theory is a candidate of the unified theory of everything. Remarkably, string theory can be consistently formulated only in 10 dimensions [1].\nThis fact requires a mechanism to fill the gap between our real world and the higher\ndimensions. Conventionally, the extra dimensions are considered to be compactified\nJiro Soda\nDepartment of Physics, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan\ne-mail: jiro@tap.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJiro Soda\n\nto a small compact space of the order of the Planck scale. However, recent developments of superstring theory invented a new idea, the so-called braneworld where\nmatter resides on the hypersurface in higher dimensional spacetime [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] (\nsee also earlier independent works [7, 8]). This hypersurface is called (mem)brane.\nThis idea originates from D-brane solutions in string theory. Interestingly, the Dbrane solution also gives rise to the AdS/CFT correspondence which claims that\nclassical gravity in an anti-de Sitter(AdS) spacetime is equivalent to a strongly\ncoupled conformally invariant field theory (CFT). Since the origin is the same,\nbraneworlds and the AdS/CFT correspondence may be related to each other. In particular, Randall and Sundrum (RS) braneworld models [9, 10] have a similar geometrical setup to that in the AdS/CFT correspondence. Hence, in this lecture, I will\ntry to reveal relations between the AdS/CFT correspondence and RS braneworld\nmodels [11].\nThe method we will use is the gradient expansion method. Physically, it is a low\nenergy expansion method. Historically, the method has been used in the cosmological context [12, 13, 14, 15]. In particular, it is known to be useful for analyzing the\nevolution of cosmological perturbations during inflation. Since the AdS spacetime\ncan be regarded as the inflating universe in the spatial direction, the gradient expansion method is also expected to be useful in the AdS spacetime. First, by utilizing the\ngradient expansion method, we approximately solve Einstein equations in the bulk.\nThen, the junction conditions at the brane give the effective equations of motion on\nthe brane. Thus, we can understand the low energy physics in the braneworld. The\nsimilar but slightly different method is also used in the AdS/CFT correspondence.\nWe will identify a concrete relation between the geometrical and the AdS/CFT correspondence approach by detailed comparison. The difference shows up when we\nconsider two brane systems. Indeed, we do not have the conventional AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence for the two-brane system. Instead, we have a conformally coupled\nradion on the brane which reflects the conformal symmetry of the theory. This observation is useful for understanding why brane inflation suffers from the eta problem. It is apparent that the gradient expansion method can be applicable to various\nbraneworld models. Moreover, as we will see, the gradient expansion method provides a unified view of branworlds and a useful tool to make cosmological predictions.\nThe organization of this lecture is as follows: In section 2, we introduce RS models and derive the effective Friedman equation on the brane. Here, two important\ncorrections, i.e., the dark radiation and the high energy corrections, are identified.\nThis sets our starting point. In section 3, we review two different views from the\nbrane, namely, the AdS/CFT correspondence and the geometrical holography. These\ntwo frameworks give us a complementary picture of the braneworlds. In section 4,\nwe present key questions to make our concerns manifest. In section 5, we review\nthe gradient expansion method. In sections 6 and 7, we apply the gradient expansion method to the single-brane model and to the two-brane model, respectively. We\nobtain the effective theory for both cases. In section 8, we give answers to the key\nquestions. This completes explanation of relations between the AdS/CFT correspondence and RS braneworld models. In section 9, we extend our analysis to models\n\n\fAdS/CFT on the brane\n\n3\n\nwith a bulk scalar field. Since the presence of bulk fields would break the conformal\ninvariance, it is interesting to consider dilatonic braneworlds in conjunction with the\nAdS/CFT correspondence. The final section is devoted to the conclusion.\n\n2 Braneworlds in AdS spacetime\nIn this section, we will introduce RS braneworld models. We will derive the effective\nFriedmann equation and identify the effects of extra-dimensions. In this lecture,\nwe will concentrate on cosmology although we can apply the results to black hole\nphysics.\n\n2.1 RS Models\nRandall and Sundrum proposed a simple model where a four-dimensional brane\nwith the tension \u03c3 is embedded in the five-dimensional asymptotically anti-de Sitter\n(AdS) bulk with a curvature scale l. This single-brane model is described by the\naction [10]\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\n12\n1\n4\n5 \u221a\n\u2212g\nR\n+\n\u03c3\n\u2212h\n+\n\u2212\nS=\nd\nx\nd\nx\nd 4 x \u2212hLmatter , (1)\n2\n2\n2\u03ba\nl\nwhere R and \u03ba 2 are the scalar curvature and gravitational constant in five-dimensions,\nrespectively. We impose Z2 symmetry on this spacetime, with the brane at the fixed\npoint. The matter Lmatter is confined to the brane. Throughout this lecture, h\u03bc\u03bd represents the induced metric on the brane. Remarkably, the internal dimension is noncompact in this model. Hence, we do not have to care about the stability problem.\nThe basic equations consist of the equations of motion in the bulk and junction\nconditions at the brane position due to the presence of the brane. Alternatively, the\nbasic equations can be regarded as the 5-dimensional Einstein equations with singular sources. Let us recall the 4-dimensional components of 5-dimensional Einstein\ntensor can be expressed by\n(5)\n\n(4)\n\u0002\n\u0003\nG \u03bc\u03bd = G \u03bc\u03bd + Ln\u03bc K\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd K + * * * ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Ln\u03bc denotes the Lie derivative along the unit normal vector to the brane, n \u03bc .\nHere, we defined the extrinsic curvature by\n\u0001\n\u03c1\nK\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 \u03b4\u03bc \u2212 n\u03bc n\u03c1 \u2207\u03c1 n\u03bd .\n(3)\nBy integrating Einstein equations along the normal to the brane, we obtain the jump\n+ \u2212 g K + ) \u2212 (K \u2212 \u2212 g K \u2212 ) from the left hand side\nof the extrinsic curvature (K\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\f4\n\nJiro Soda\n\nand the total energy momentum tensor on the brane from the right hand side due to\n+ =\nthe delta function sources. Thus, taking into account the Z2 symmetry K\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 K\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212\n\u2212K\u03bc\u03bd , we obtain the junction conditions\n\u0002 \u03bc\n\u03bc \u0003\nK \u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd K\n\nat the brane\n\n=\n\n\u0001\n\u03ba2\n\u03bc\n\u2212\u03c3 \u03b4\u03bd + T \u03bc \u03bd .\n2\n\n(4)\n\nHere, T\u03bc\u03bd represents the energy-momentum tensor of the matter.\nOriginally, they proposed the two-brane model as a possible solution of the hierarchy problem [9]. The action reads\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n12\n5 \u221a\nS=\nd x \u2212g R + 2\n2\u03ba 2\nl\nZ\nZ\np\n\u221a\ni\n4\n,\n(5)\n\u2212 \u2211 \u03c3i d x \u2212hi + \u2211\nd 4 x \u2212hLmatter\ni=\u2295,\u2296\n\ni=\u2295,\u2296\n\nwhere \u2295 and \u2296 represent the positive and the negative tension branes, respectively.\nIn principle, one can consider multiple-branes although they are not discussed in\nthis lecture.\n\n2.2 Cosmology\nThe homogeneous cosmology of the single-brane model is easy to analyze [16].\nBecause of the Birkoff theorem due to the symmetry on the brane, it is sufficient to\nconsider AdS black hole spacetime:\nds2 = \u2212h(r)dt 2 +\nwhere\n\nand\n\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0002\ndr2\n+ r2 d \u03c7 2 + fk2 (\u03c7 ) d \u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8 d \u03c6 2 ,\nh(r)\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 sin \u03c7 for k = 1\n\u03c7\nfor k = 0\nfk =\n\uf8f3\nsinh \u03c7 for k = \u22121\nh(r) = k \u2212\n\nM r2\n+ .\nr 2 l2\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nNote that M is the mass of the black hole, k is the curvature of the horizon and l\nis the AdS curvature radius. Suppose the brane is moving in this spacetime with a\ntrajectory t = t(\u03c4 ) , r = a(\u03c4 ), where \u03c4 is a proper time of the brane (see Fig.1). The\ninduced metric on the brane becomes\n\n\fAdS/CFT on the brane\n\n5\n\nds2ind = \u2212d \u03c4 2 + a2 (\u03c4 ) d \u03c7 2 + fk2 (\u03c7 ) d \u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8 d \u03c6\n\u0002\n\n\u0001\u0003\n2\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nThis is nothing but the Friedman-Robertson-Walker spacetime where a is the scale\nfactor. The motion of the brane cannot be arbitrary. It is constrained by the junction\ncondition:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03ba 2\u03c3 \u03ba 2 \u03c7\n1\nK\u03c7 \u03c7 = \u2212\nT \u03c7\u2212 T ,\n\u2212\n(10)\n6\n2\n3\nwhere K \u03c7 \u03c7 , T \u03c7 \u03c7 , T are a \u03c7 \u03c7 component of the extrinsic curvature, a \u03c7 \u03c7 component and the trace part of the energy momentum tensor of matter on the brane,\nrespectively. From the normalization condition n\u03bc n\u03bc = 1 of the unit normal vector\n\nFig. 1 The Minkowski brane represented by the dotted line is a static brane in the Poincare coordinate system of the AdS spacetime. While, the cosmological brane represented by the thick line\nis moving in the bulk. The motion of the brane induces the expansion of the brane universe. The\nCauchy horizon of AdS spacetime corresponds to the big-bang singularity. In the case of AdSSchwarzschild spacetime, the horizon should be the past horizon of the black hole.

The Newton's constant can be identified\nas 8\u03c0 GN = \u03ba 2 /l. The curvature of the horizon k corresponds spatial curvature of\nthe universe. The black hole mass M is referred to as the dark radiation [22] which\nis not real radiation fluid but a reflection of the bulk geometry. This effect exists\neven in the low energy regime. The last term represents the high energy effect of the\nbraneworld [23].\nAs to the two-brane model, the same effective Friedmann equation (16) can be\nexpected on each brane because the above equation (16) has been deduced without\nreferring to the bulk equations of motion.\nGiven this cosmological background, it is natural to investigate cosmological perturbation in the braneworld [24]. In the case of the single-brane model, it is shown\nthat the gravity in Minkowski brane is localized on the brane in spite of the noncompact extra dimension. Consequently, it turned out that the conventional linearized\nEinstein equation approximately holds at scales large compared with the curvature\nscale l. It should be stressed that this result can be attained by imposing the outgoing boundary conditions. It turns out that this is also true in the cosmological\nbackground [25].\nIn the case of the two-brane model, Garriga and Tanaka analyzed linearized gravity and have shown that the gravity on the brane behaves as the Brans-Dicke theory\nat low energy [26]. Thus, the conventional linearized Einstein equations do not hold\neven on scales large compared with the curvature scale l in the bulk. Charmousis et\nal. have clearly identified the Brans-Dicke field as the radion mode [27].\n\n\fAdS/CFT on the brane\n\n7\n\nIn the end, we would like to know how nonlinear gravity in the braneworld is\ndeviated from the conventional Einstein gravity. A partial answer will be given in\nthe following sections.\n\n3 View from the brane\nIn the previous section, we have considered an isotropic and homogeneous universe\nand seen that the effective Friedmann equation on the brane can be regarded as\nthe conventional Friedmann equation with two kind of corrections, i.e., the dark\nradiation and high-energy corrections. Here, we review two different approaches to\nextend the above result to more general cases.\n\n3.1 AdS/CFT Correspondence\nLet us start with the AdS/CFT correspondence [28, 29, 30]. After solving the equations of motion in the bulk with the boundary value fixed and substituting the solution gcl into the 5-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action S5d , we obtain the effective\naction for the boundary field h = gcl |boundary . The statement of the AdS/CFT correspondence is that the resultant effective action can be equated with the partition\nfunctional of some conformally invariant field theory (CFT), namely\n\u0014Z\n\u0015\nexp [iS5d [gcl ]] \u2248< exp i hO >CFT ,\n(17)\nwhere O is the field in CFT. In the right hand side, h should be interpreted as a source\nfield. This action must be defined at the AdS infinity where the conformal symmetry\nexists as the asymptotic symmetry. Hence, there exist infrared divergences which\nmust be subtracted by counter terms. Thus, the correct formula becomes\n\u0014Z\n\u0015\nexp [iS5d [gcl ] + iSct ] =< exp i hO >CFT ,\n(18)\nwhere we added the counter terms\nSct = Sbrane \u2212 S4d \u2212 [ R2 terms ] ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere Sbrane and S4d are the brane action and the 4-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action, respectively. Here, the higher curvature terms [R2 terms] should be understood\nsymbolically.\nIn the case of the braneworld, the brane acts as the cutoff. Therefore, there is no\ndivergences in the above expressions. In other words, no counter term is necessary.\nWe can regard the above relation as the definition of the \"cut off\" CFT. Thus, we\n\n\f8\n\nJiro Soda\n\ncan freely rearrange the terms as follows\nS5d + Sbrane = S4d + SCFT + [ R2 terms ] ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere we have defined\n\u0014Z\n\u0015\nexp iSCFT \u2261< exp i hO >CFT .\n\n(21)\n\nThis tells us that the brane models can be described as the conventional Einstein\ntheory with the cutoff CFT and higher order curvature terms [31, 32, 33, 34]. In\nterms of the equations of motion, the AdS/CFT correspondence reads\n(4)\n\nG \u03bc\u03bd =\n\n\u0001\n\u03ba2\nCFT\nT\u03bc\u03bd + T\u03bc\u03bd\n+ [ R2 terms ] ,\nl\n\n(22)\n\nCFT denotes\nwhere the R2 terms represent the higher order curvature terms and T\u03bc\u03bd\nthe energy-momentum tensor of the cutoff version of conformal field theory. When\nwe apply this result to cosmology, we see CFT corresponds to the dark radiation in\nthe braneworld and the higher curvature terms can be reduced to the high-energy\ncorrections.\n\n3.2 Geometrical Holography\nHere, let us review the geometrical approach [35]. In the Gaussian normal coordinate system:\nds2 = dy2 + g \u03bc\u03bd (y, x\u03bc )dx\u03bc dx\u03bd ,\n\n(23)\n\n(5)\n\nwe can write the 5-dimensional Einstein tensor G \u03bc\u03bd in terms of the 4-dimensional\n(4)\n\nEinstein tensor G \u03bc\u03bd and the extrinsic curvature as\n(5)\n\n(4)\n\nG \u03bc\u03bd = G \u03bc\u03bd + K\u03bc\u03bd ,y \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd K,y \u2212 KK\u03bc\u03bd + 2K\u03bc\u03bb K \u03bb \u03bd\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n+ g\u03bc\u03bd K 2 + K \u03b1 \u03b2 K \u03b2 \u03b1\n2\n6\n= 2 g\u03bc\u03bd ,\nl\n\n(24)\n\nwhere we have introduced the extrinsic curvature\n1\nK\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd ,y ,\n2\n\n(25)\n\n\fAdS/CFT on the brane\n\n9\n\nand the last equality comes from the 5-dimensional Einstein equations. On the other\nhand, the Weyl tensor in the bulk can be expressed as\nCy\u03bc y\u03bd = K\u03bc\u03bd ,y \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd K,y + K\u03bc \u03bb K\u03bb \u03bd + g\u03bc\u03bd K \u03b1\u03b2 K\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212\n\n3\ng \u03bc\u03bd .\nl2\n\n(26)\n\nNow, one can eliminate K\u03bc\u03bd ,y \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd K,y from (24) using (26) and obtain\n(4)\n\nG \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212Cy\u03bc y\u03bd + KK\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 K\u03bc\u03bb K \u03bb \u03bd\n\u0010\n\u0011 3\n1\n\u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd K 2 \u2212 K \u03b1 \u03b2 K \u03b2 \u03b1 + 2 g\u03bc\u03bd .\n2\nl\n\n(27)\n\nTaking into account the Z2 symmetry, we also obtain the junction conditions\n\u0002 \u03bc\n\u03bc \u0003\nK \u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd K\n\ny=0\n\n=\n\n\u0001\n\u03ba2\n\u03bc\n\u2212\u03c3 \u03b4\u03bd + T \u03bc \u03bd .\n2\n\n(28)\n\nHere, T\u03bc\u03bd represents the energy-momentum tensor of the matter. Evaluating Eq. (27)\nat the brane and substituting the junction condition into it, we have the \"effective\"\nequations of motion\n(4)\n\nG \u03bc\u03bd =\n\n\u03ba2\nT\u03bc\u03bd + \u03ba 4\u03c0\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 E\u03bc\u03bd\nl\n\nwhere we have defined the quadratic of the energy momentum tensor\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u03bb\n1\n1\n1 2\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03c0\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 T\u03bc T\u03bb \u03bd + T T\u03bc\u03bd + g\u03bc\u03bd T T\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 T\n4\n12\n8\n3\n\n(29)\n\n(30)\n\nand the projection of Weyl tensor Cy\u03bc y\u03bd onto the brane\nE\u03bc\u03bd = Cy\u03bc y\u03bd |y=0 .\nHere, we assumed the relation\n\n\u03ba 2\u03c3 =\n\n6\nl\n\n(31)\n\nso that the effective cosmological constant vanishes.\nBecause of the traceless property of E\u03bc\u03bd , when we consider an isotropic and\nhomogeneous universe, it is easy to show that this gives the dark radiation component \u221d 1/a4. The existence of the high-energy corrections \u221d \u03c1 2 is apparent in this\napproach.\nThe geometrical approach is useful to classify possible corrections to the conventional Einstein equations. One defect of this approach is the fact that the projected\nWeyl tensor E\u03bc\u03bd can not be determined without solving the equations in the bulk.\n\n\f10\n\nJiro Soda\n\n4 Does AdS/CFT play any role in braneworld?\nTo make our concerns explicit, we give a sequence of questions. We treat the singlebrane model and two-brane model, separately.\n\n4.1 Single-brane model\nIs the Einstein theory recovered even in the non-linear regime?\nIn the case of the linear theory, it is known that the conventional Einstein theory is\nrecovered at low energy. On the other hand, the cosmological consideration suggests\nthe deviation from the conventional Friedmann equation even in the low energy\nregime. This is due to the dark radiation term. Therefore, we need to clarify when\nthe conventional Einstein theory can be recovered on the brane.\nHow does the AdS/CFT come into the braneworld?\nIt was argued that the cutoff CFT comes into the braneworld. However, no\none knows what is the cutoff CFT. It is a vague concept at least from the point\nof view of the classical gravity. Moreover, it should be noted that the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence is a specific conjecture. Indeed, originally, Maldacena conjectured\nthat the supergravity on AdS5 \u00d7 S5 is dual to the four-dimensional N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory [28]. Nevertheless, the AdS/CFT correspondence seems to\nbe related to the brane world model as has been demonstrated by several people [32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. Hence, it is important to reveal the role\nof the AdS/CFT correspondence starting from the 5-dimensional general relativity.\nHow are the AdS/CFT and geometrical approach related?\nThe geometrical approach gives the effective equations of motion (29)\n(4)\n\nG \u03bc\u03bd =\n\n\u03ba2\nT\u03bc\u03bd + \u03ba 4\u03c0\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 E\u03bc\u03bd .\nl\n\nOn the other hand, the AdS/CFT correspondence yields the other effective equations\nof motion (22)\n(4)\n\u0001\n\u03ba2\nCFT\nT\u03bc\u03bd + T\u03bc\u03bd\n+ [ R2 terms ] .\nG \u03bc\u03bd =\nl\nAn apparent difference is remarkable.\nIt is an interesting issue to clarify how these two descriptions are related. Shiromizu and Ida tried to understand the AdS/CFT correspondence from the geomet\u03bc\nrical point of view [42]. They argued that \u03c0 \u03bc corresponds to the trace anomaly of\n\n\fAdS/CFT on the brane\n\n11\n\nthe cutoff CFT on the brane. However, this result is rather paradoxical because there\n\u03bc\nexists no trace anomaly in an odd dimensional brane although \u03c0 \u03bc exists even in that\ncase. Thus, the more precise relation between the geometrical and the AdS/CFT approaches should be given.\nMoreover, since both the geometrical and AdS/CFT approaches seem to have\ntheir own merit, it would be beneficial to understand the mutual relationship.\n\n4.2 Two-brane model\nHow is the geometrical approach consistent with the Brans-Dicke picture?\nIrrespective of the existence of other branes, the geometric approach gives the\nsame effective equations (29). The effect of the bulk geometry comes into the brane\nworld only through E\u03bc\u03bd . In this picture, the two-brane system can be regarded as\nthe Einstein theory with some corrections due to the Weyl tensor in the bulk.\nOn the other hand, the linearized gravity on the brane behaves as the BransDicke theory on scales large compared with the curvature scale l in the bulk [26].\nTherefore, the conventional linearized Einstein equations do not hold at low energy.\nIn the geometrical approach, no radion appears. While, from the linear analysis,\nit turns out that the system can be described by the Brans-Dicke theory where the\nextra scalar field is nothing but the radion. How can we reconcile these seemingly\nincompatible pictures?\nWhat replaces the AdS/CFT correspondence in the two-brane model?\nIn the single-brane model, there are continuum Kaluza-Klein (KK)-spectrum\naround the zero mode. They induce the CFT matter in the 4-dimensional effective\naction. In the two-brane system, the spectrum become discrete and then a mass gap\nexists. Hence, we can not expect CFT matter on the brane, although KK-modes exist and affect the physics on the brane. So, it is interesting to know if the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence play a role in the two-brane system.\n\n5 Gradient Expansion Method\nOur aim in this lecture is to show the gradient expansion method gives the answers to\nall of the questions presented in the previous section. Here, we review the formalism\ndeveloped by us [43, 44, 45, 46].\nWe use the Gaussian normal coordinate system (23) to describe the geometry of\nthe brane world. Note that the brane is located at y = 0 in this coordinate system.\nDecomposing the extrinsic curvature into the traceless part and the trace part\n\n\f12\n\nJiro Soda\n\n1\nK\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a3 \u03bc\u03bd + h\u03bc\u03bd K ,\n4\n\nK=\u2212\n\n\u221a\n\u2202\nlog \u2212g ,\n\u2202y\n\nwe obtain the basic equations which hold in the bulk;\n\"\n#\n(4)\n1 \u03bc (4)\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03a3 \u03bd ,y \u2212 K \u03a3 \u03bd = \u2212 R \u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd R ,\n4\n\" #\n(4)\n3 2\n12\nK \u2212 \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2\u03a3\u03b2 \u03b1 = R + 2 ,\n4\nl\n1\n4\nK,y \u2212 K 2 \u2212 \u03a3 \u03b1\u03b2 \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212 2 ,\n4\nl\n3\n\u2207\u03bb \u03a3 \u03bc \u03bb \u2212 \u2207\u03bc K = 0 ,\n4\n\n(32)\n\n(33)\n(34)\n(35)\n(36)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere R \u03bc \u03bd is the curvature on the brane and \u2207\u03bc denotes the covariant derivative\nwith respect to the metric g\u03bc\u03bd . One also has the junction condition\n\u0002 \u03bc\n\u03bc \u0003\nK \u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd K\n\ny=0\n\n=\n\n\u0001\n\u03ba2\n\u03bc\n\u2212\u03c3 \u03b4\u03bd + T \u03bc \u03bd .\n2\n\n(37)\n\nRecall that we are considering the Z2 symmetric spacetime.\nThe problem now is separated into two parts. First, we will solve the bulk equations of motion with the Dirichlet boundary condition at the brane,\ng\u03bc\u03bd (y = 0, x\u03bc ) = h\u03bc\u03bd (x\u03bc ) .\n\n(38)\n\nAfter that, the junction condition will be imposed at the brane. As it is the condition\nfor the induced metric h\u03bc\u03bd , it is naturally interpreted as the effective equations of\nmotion for gravity on the brane.\nAlong the normal coordinate y, the metric varies with a characteristic length scale\nl; g\u03bc\u03bd ,y \u223c g\u03bc\u03bd /l. Denote the characteristic length scale of the curvature fluctuation\non the brane as L; then we have R \u223c g \u03bc\u03bd /L2 . For the reader's reference, let us take\nl = 1 mm, for example. Then, the relation (31) give the scale, \u03ba 2 = (108 GeV)\u22123\nand \u03c3 = 1 TeV4 . In this lecture, we will consider the low energy regime in the sense\nthat the energy density of matter, \u03c1 , on the brane is smaller than the brane tension,\n\u0131.e., \u03c1 /\u03c3 \u226a 1. In this regime, a simple dimensional analysis\nl\u03ba \u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u223c l2 \u223c\n\u03c3\n\u03ba \u03c3\n2\n\n\u0012 \u00132\nl\n\u226a1\nL\n\n(39)\n\nimplies that the curvature on the brane can be neglected compared with the extrinsic\ncurvature at low energy. Here, we have used the relation (31) and Einstein's equation\non the brane, R \u223c g\u03bc\u03bd /L2 \u223c \u03ba 2 \u03c1 /l. Thus, the anti-Newtonian or gradient expansion\nmethod used in the cosmological context is applicable to our problem [12].\n\n\fAdS/CFT on the brane\n\n13\n\nAt zeroth order, we can neglect the curvature term. Then we have\n(0)(0)\n\n(0)\n\n\u03a3 \u03bc \u03bd ,y \u2212 K \u03a3 \u03bc \u03bd = 0 ,\n\n(40)\n\n12\n3 (0)2 (0)\u03b1 (0)\u03b2\nK \u2212\u03a3 \u03b2\u03a3 \u03b1= 2 ,\n4\nl\n(0)\n4\n1 (0)2 (0)\u03b1\u03b2 (0)\nK ,y \u2212 K \u2212 \u03a3 \u03a3 \u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212 2 ,\n4\nl\n(0)\n(0)\n3\n\u2207\u03bb \u03a3 \u03bb \u03bc \u2212 \u2207\u03bc K = 0 .\n4\n\n(41)\n(42)\n(43)\n\nEquation (40) can be readily integrated into\n(0)\n\n\u03a3 \u03bc\u03bd =\n\nC \u03bc \u03bd (x\u03bc )\n\u221a\n,\n\u2212g\n\nC\u03bc \u03bc = 0 ,\n\n(44)\n\nwhere C \u03bc \u03bd is the constant of integration. Equation (43) also requires C \u03bc \u03bd |\u03bc = 0.\nIf it could exist, it would represent a radiation like fluid on the brane and hence a\nstrongly anisotropic universe. In fact, as we see soon, this term must vanish in order\nto satisfy the junction condition. Therefore, we simply put C \u03bc \u03bd = 0, hereafter. Now,\nit is easy to solve the remaining equations. The result is\n(0)\n\nK=\n\n4\n.\nl\n\n(45)\n\nUsing the definition of the extrinsic curvature\n(0)\n\nK \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\n\n1 \u2202 (0)\ng \u03bc\u03bd ,\n2 \u2202y\n\n(46)\n\nwe get the zeroth order metric as\nds2 = dy2 + b2 (y)h \u03bc\u03bd (x\u03bc )dx\u03bc dx\u03bd ,\n\ny\n\nb(y) = e\u22122 l ,\n\n(47)\n\nwhere the tensor h\u03bc\u03bd is the induced metric on the brane, which conforms to the\nboundary condition (38).\nFrom the zeroth order solution, we obtain\n#\n\"\n(0)\n(0)\n3 \u03bc\n\u03ba2 \u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nK \u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd K\n= \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd = \u2212 \u03c3 \u03b4\u03bd .\n(48)\nl\n2\ny=0\n\nThen we get the well known relation\n\n\u03ba 2 \u03c3 = 6/l .\n\n(49)\n\n\f14\n\nJiro Soda\n\nHere, we will assume that this relation holds exactly. It is apparent that C \u03bc \u03bd is not\nallowed to exist.\nThe iteration scheme consists in writing the metric g\u03bc\u03bd as a sum of local tensors\nbuilt out of the induced metric on the brane, the number of gradients increasing with\nthe order. Hence, we will seek the metric as a perturbative series\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(1)\n(2)\n2\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n(50)\ng\u03bc\u03bd (y, x ) = b (y) h\u03bc\u03bd (x ) + g \u03bc\u03bd (y, x ) + g \u03bc\u03bd (y, x ) + * * * ,\nwhere b2 (y) is extracted and we put the Dirichlet boundary condition\n(i)\n\ng \u03bc\u03bd (y = 0, x\u03bc ) = 0 ,\n\n(51)\n\nso that g\u03bc\u03bd (y = 0, x) = h \u03bc\u03bd (x) holds at the brane.

Furthermore, we carefully consider the constants of integration, i.e., homogeneous solutions. These homogeneous solutions are ignored\nin the calculation of AdS/CFT correspondence. However, they play an important role in the braneworld.

Recall that the\ndark radiation exists even in the low energy regime. Indeed, the low energy effective\nFriedmann equation becomes\nH2 =\n\n\u03ba2\nC\n\u03c1+ 4 .\n3l\na\n\n(65)\n\nThis equation can be obtained from Eq. (64) by imposing the maximal symmetry on\nthe spatial part of the brane world and the conditions (59). Hence, we observe that\n\u03c7 \u03bc \u03bd is the generalization of the dark radiation found in the cosmological context.\nThe nonlocal tensor \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd must be determined by the boundary conditions in the\nbulk. The natural choice is asymptotically AdS boundary condition. For this boundary condition, we have \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd = 0. It is this boundary condition that leads to the conventional Einstein theory in linearized gravity. Assuming this, we have\n\n\u03ba2 \u03bc\n1 \u03bc\nR\u03bc \u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd R =\nT \u03bd.\n2\nl\n\n(66)\n\nThus, the conventional Einstein theory is recovered at the leading order!\n\n6.2 AdS/CFT Emerges\nIn this subsection, we do not include the \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd field because we have adopted the AdS\nboundary condition. Of course, we have calculated the second order solutions with\nthe contribution of the \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd field. It merely adds extra terms such as \u03c7 \u03bc \u03bd \u03c7 \u03bd \u03bc , etc.\n\n\fAdS/CFT on the brane\n\n17\n\nAt second order, the basic equations can be easily deduced. Substituting the solution up to first order into the Ricci tensor and picking up the second order quantities,\nwe obtain the solutions at second order.

Moreover, it must satisfy the\nmomentum constraint. To be more precise, we must solve the constraint equation\nt \u03bc \u03bd |\u03bc \u2212\n\n1 \u03b1 \u03b2\n1\n1\nR R\n+ RR \u2212 R R\u03bb \u03bd = 0 .\n16 \u03b2 \u03b1 |\u03bd 48 |\u03bd 24 |\u03bb\n\n(71)\n\nAs one can see immediately, there are ambiguities in integrating this equation. Indeed, there are two types of covariant local tensor whose divergences vanish:\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a 1\nd 4 x \u2212h R\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03b1\u03b2 = d 4 x \u2212hH\u03bc\u03bd \u03b4 g\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n\u03b4 d 4 x \u2212h R2 = d 4 x \u2212hK\u03bc\u03bd \u03b4 g\u03bc\u03bd .\n2\n\n\u03b4\n\nZ\n\n(72)\n(73)\n\nNotice that S \u03bc \u03bd = H \u03bc \u03bd \u2212 K \u03bc \u03bd /3. Hence, only S \u03bc \u03bd and K \u03bc \u03bd are independent.\nThanks to the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant, we do not need to consider the\nRiemann squared term. In addition to these local tensors, we have to take into account the nonlocal tensor \u03c4 \u03bc \u03bd with the property \u03c4 \u03bc \u03bd |\u03bc = 0. Thus, we get\nt\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u03bc\n1\n1 \u03bc\n1\n\u03b4\u03bd R\u03b1 \u03b2 R\u03b2 \u03b1 \u2212 R2 +\nRR\u03bc \u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd R2\n32\n3\n24\n4\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b2\n1\n+\u03c4 \u03bc \u03bd + \u03b1 +\nS \u03bc\u03bd + K \u03bc\u03bd ,\n4\n3\n\n(74)\n\nwhere the constants \u03b1 and \u03b2 are free parameters representing the degree of initial\nconditions in the bulk. Hence, they represents the freedom of gravitational waves in\n\n\f18\n\nJiro Soda\n\nthe bulk. The condition t \u03bc \u03bc = 0 leads to\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n\u03c4\u03bc \u03bc = \u2212\nR\u03b1 \u03b2 R\u03b2 \u03b1 \u2212 R2 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2737R .\n8\n3\n\n(75)\n\nThis expression is the reminiscent of the trace anomaly of the CFT. It is possible to\nuse the result of CFT at this point. For example, we can choose the N = 4 super\nYang-Mills theory as the conformal matter. In that case, we simply put \u03b2 = 0. This\nis the way the AdS/CFT correspondence comes into the brane world scenario.\nUp to the second order, the junction condition gives\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03b2 \u03bc\n\u03ba2 \u03bc\n1 \u03bc\n2\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nT \u03bd.\nR \u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd R + 2l \u03c4 \u03bd + \u03b1 S \u03bd + K \u03bd =\n(76)\n2\n3\nl\nIf we define\nCFT\n= \u22122\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n\nl3\n\u03c4\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u03ba2\n\n(77)\n\nwe can write\n(4)\n\nG \u03bc\u03bd =\n\n\u0001\n\u03ba2\n2l2\nCFT\n\u2212 2l2\u03b1 S\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\u03b2 K\u03bc\u03bd .\nT\u03bc\u03bd + T\u03bc\u03bd\nl\n3\n\n(78)\n\nLet us try to arrange the terms so as to reveal the geometrical meaning of the\nabove equation.

On\nthe other hand, P\u03bc \u03bd is determined locally. One can see the relationship in a more\ntransparent way. Within the accuracy we are considering, we can get P\u03bc \u03bd = \u03c0 \u03bc \u03bd\n\u03bc\nusing the lowest order equation R\u03bc \u03bd = \u03ba 2 /l(T \u03bc \u03bd \u22121/2\u03b4\u03bd T ).

Although \u03a9 is constant for vacuum branes, it becomes the\nfunction of the 4-dimensional coordinates if we put the matter on the brane.\nAdding the energy momentum tensor to each of the two branes, and allowing\ndeviations from the pure AdS5 bulk, the effective (non-local) Einstein equations on\nthe branes at low energies take the form[44],\n2\n\u03ba2 \u2295\u03bc\nT \u03bd \u2212 \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd ,\nl\nl\n\u03ba2 \u2296\u03bc\n2 \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\nG \u03bd( f ) = \u2212 T \u03bd \u2212\n.\nl\nl \u03a94\nG\u03bc \u03bd (h) =\n\n(84)\n(85)\n\n-brane , f = g\u2296-brane = \u03a9 2 h and the terms proportional to\nwhere h\u03bc\u03bd = g\u2295\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03c7\u03bc\u03bd are 5-dimensional Weyl tensor contributions which describe the non-local 5dimensional effect. Although Eqs. (84) and (85) are non-local individually, with\nundetermined \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd , one can combine both equations to reduce them to local equations for each brane. Since \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd appears only algebraically, one can easily eliminate\n\u03c7\u03bc\u03bd from Eqs. (84) and (85).

Hence,\nwe need to invent a new method [52]. For this purpose, we shall start with the\neffective Einstein equation obtained by Shromizu, Maeda, and Sasaki [35]\nG\u03bc\u03bd = T\u03bc\u03bd + \u03c0\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 E\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(91)\n\nwhere \u03c0\u03bc\u03bd is the quadratic of energy momentum tensor T\u03bc\u03bd and E\u03bc\u03bd represents the\neffect of the bulk geometry. Here we have set 8\u03c0 G = 1. This geometrical projection\napproach can not give a concrete prediction, because we do not know E\u03bc\u03bd without\nsolving the equations of motion in the bulk. Fortunately, in the case of the homogeneous cosmology, the property E \u03bc \u03bc = 0 determines the dynamics as\n1\nC\nH2 = \u03c1 + \u03c12 + 4 .\n3\na\n\n(92)\n\nThis reflects the interplay between the bulk and the brane dynamics on the brane.\nWhat we want to seek is an effective theory which contains the information of\nthe bulk as finite number of constant parameters like C in the homogeneous universe. When we succeed in obtaining it, the cosmological perturbation theory can\nbe constructed in a usual way. Although the concrete prediction can not be made,\nqualitative understanding of the evolution of the cosmological fluctuations can be\nobtained. This must be useful to make observational predictions.\nIn the two-brane system, the mass spectrum is known from the linear analysis [26]. At low energy, the propagator for the KK mode with the mass m can be\n\n\f22\n\nJiro Soda\n\nexpanded as\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u22121\n\u2737 \u27372\n1\n1\n+\n=\n+\n+\n*\n*\n*\n.\n\u2737 \u2212 m2 m2\nm2 m4\n\n(93)\n\nHowever, massless modes can not be expanded in this way, hence we must take into\naccount all of the massless modes to construct braneworld effective action. It seems\nlegitimate to assume this consideration is valid even in the non-linear regime. Thus,\nat low energy, the action can be expanded by the local terms with increasing orders\nof derivatives of the metric g\u03bc\u03bd and the radion \u03a8 [44].\nLet us illustrate our method using the following action truncated at the second\norder derivatives:\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n\u03c9 (\u03a8 ) \u03bc\nSeff =\n(94)\n\u2207 \u03a8 \u2207\u03bc \u03a8 ,\nd 4 x \u2212g \u03a8 R \u2212 2\u039b (\u03a8 ) \u2212\n2\n\u03a8\nwhich is nothing but the scalar-tensor theory with coupling function \u03c9 (\u03a8 ) and the\npotential function \u039b (\u03a8 ). Note that this is the most general local action which contains up to the second order derivatives and has the general coordinate invariance.\nIt should be stressed that the scalar-tensor theory is, in general, not related to the\nbraneworld. However, we know a special type of scalar-tensor theory corresponds\nto the low energy braneworld [44, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]. Here, we will present a simple\nderivation of this known fact.\nFor the vacuum brane, we can put T\u03bc\u03bd + \u03c0\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u03bb g\u03bc\u03bd . Hence, the geometrical\neffective equation reduces to\nG\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212E\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03bb g\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(95)\n\nFirst, we must find E\u03bc\u03bd . The above action (94) gives the equations of motion for the\nmetric as\n\u0001\n\u039b\n1\n\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd \u03a8 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u2737\u03a8\ng\u03bc\u03bd +\n\u03a8 \u0012 \u03a8\n\u0013\n\u03c9\n1\n\u03b1\n+ 2 \u2207\u03bc \u03a8 \u2207\u03bd \u03a8 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u2207 \u03a8 \u2207\u03b1 \u03a8 .\n\u03a8\n2\n\nG\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\n\n(96)\n\nThe right hand side of this Eq. (96) should be identified with \u2212E\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03bb g\u03bc\u03bd . Hence,\nthe condition E \u03bc \u03bc = 0 becomes\n\u2737\u03a8 = \u2212\n\n\u03c9 \u03bc\n4\n\u2207 \u03a8 \u2207\u03bc \u03a8 \u2212 (\u039b \u2212 \u03bb\u03a8 ) .\n3\u03a8\n3\n\n(97)\n\nThis is the equation for the radion \u03a8 . However, we also have the equation for \u03a8\nfrom the action (94) as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c9\u2032\n\u03a8\n\u03a8\n1\n\u2737\u03a8 =\n\u2212\nR + \u039b\u2032 ,\n(98)\n\u2207\u03b1 \u03a8 \u2207\u03b1 \u03a8 \u2212\n2\u03a8 2\u03c9\n2\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\n\fAdS/CFT on the brane\n\n23\n\nwhere the prime denotes the derivative with respect to \u03a8 . In order for these two\nEqs. (97) and (98) to be compatible, \u039b and \u03c9 must satisfy\n\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\u2032\n1\n=\n\u2212\n,\n3\u03a8\n2\u03a8 2\u03c9\n\u0001\n\u03a8\n4\n(\u039b \u2212 \u03bb\u03a8 ) =\n2\u03bb \u2212 \u039b \u2032 ,\n3\n\u03c9\n\n\u2212\n\n(99)\n(100)\n\nwhere we used R = 4\u03bb which comes from the trace part of Eq. (95). Eqs. (99) and\n(100) can be integrated as\n\n\u039b (\u03a8 ) = \u03bb + \u03bb \u03b3 (1 \u2212 \u03a8 )2 ,\n\n\u03c9 (\u03a8 ) =\n\n3 \u03a8\n,\n2 1 \u2212\u03a8\n\n(101)\n\nwhere the constant of integration \u03b3 represents the ratio of the cosmological constant\non the negative tension brane to that on the positive tension brane. Here, one of\nconstants of integration is absorbed by rescaling of \u03a8 . In doing so, we have assumed\nthe constant of integration is positive. We can also describe the negative tension\nbrane if we take the negative signature.\nThus, we get the effective action\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u221a\n3\n1\n\u2207\u03bc \u03a8 \u2207\u03bc \u03a8 \u2212 \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb \u03b3 (1 \u2212 \u03a8 )2 . (102)\nSeff = d 4 x \u2212g \u03a8 R \u2212\n2\n4(1 \u2212 \u03a8 )\nSurprisingly, this completely agrees with the previous result (89). Our simple symmetry principle E \u03bc \u03bc = 0 has determined the action completely.\nAs we have shown in [58], if \u03b3 < \u22121 there exists a static deSitter two-brane\nsolution which turns out to be unstable. In particular, two inflating branes can collide\nat \u03a8 = 0. This process is completely smooth for the observer on the brane. This fact\nled us to the born-again scenario [58, 59]. The similar process occurs also in the\nekpyrotic (cyclic) model [60] where the moduli approximation is used. It can be\nshown that the moduli approximation is nothing but the lowest order truncation of\nthe low energy gradient expansion method developed by us [61, 62, 63, 64]. Hence,\nit is of great interest to see the leading order corrections due to KK modes to this\nprocess.\nLet us now apply the conformal symmetry method explained above to the higher\norder case. First, we need to write down the most generic action containing up\nto fourth order derivatives. Then, we impose the symmetry to determine unknown\nfunctionals. The action reads\n\n\f24\n\nJiro Soda\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u221a\n\u03c9 (\u03a8 ) \u03bc\n1\nSeff =\n\u2207 \u03a8 \u2207\u03bc \u03a8\nd 4 x \u2212g \u03a8 R \u2212 2\u039b (\u03a8 ) \u2212\n2\n\u03a8\nZ\nh\n\u0001\n\u221a\n2\n+ d 4 x \u2212g A(\u03a8 ) \u2207\u03bc \u03a8 \u2207\u03bc \u03a8 + B(\u03a8 ) (\u2737\u03a8 )2\nZ\n\n+C(\u03a8 )\u2207\u03bc \u03a8 \u2207\u03bc \u03a8 \u2737\u03a8 + D(\u03a8 )R \u2737\u03a8\n\n+E(\u03a8 )R\u2207\u03bc \u03a8 \u2207\u03bc \u03a8 + F(\u03a8 )R\u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc \u03a8 \u2207\u03bd \u03a8\n+G(\u03a8 )R2 + H(\u03a8 )R\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd\ni\n+I(\u03a8 )R\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u03c1 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u03c1 + * * * ,\n\n(103)\n\nwhere A, B, * * * denote arbitrary functionals of the radion.\nNow we impose the conformal symmetry on the fourth order derivative terms in\nthe action (103) as we did in the previous example. Starting from the action (103),\none can read off the equation for the metric from which E\u03bc\u03bd can be identified. The\ncompatibility between the equations of motion for \u03a8 and the equation E \u03bc \u03bc = 0 constrains the coefficient functionals in the action (103). Surprisingly, every coefficient\nfunctionals are determined up to constants.\nThus, we find the 4-dimensional effective action with KK corrections as\n\u0014\nZ\n\u221a\n3\n1\n\u2207\u03bc \u03a8 \u2207\u03bc \u03a8\nSeff = d 4 x \u2212g \u03a8 R \u2212\n2\n4(1 \u2212 \u03a8 )\n\u0003\n\u2212\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb \u03b3 (1 \u2212 \u03a8 )2\n\u0014\nZ\n\u00012\n1\n2\n4 \u221a\n\u2207\u03bc \u03a8 \u2207\u03bc \u03a8\n+l\nd x \u2212g\n4(1 \u2212 \u03a8 )4\n1\n1\n(\u2737\u03a8 )2 +\n\u2207\u03bc \u03a8 \u2207\u03bc \u03a8 \u2737\u03a8\n+\n(1 \u2212 \u03a8 )2\n(1 \u2212 \u03a8 )3\n2\n1\n+\nR\u2207\u03bc \u03a8 \u2207\u03bc \u03a8\nR\u2737\u03a8 +\n3(1 \u2212 \u03a8 )\n3(1 \u2212 \u03a8 )2\n\u0003\n(104)\n+ jR2 + kR\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\nwhere constants j and k can be interpreted as the variety of the effects of the bulk\ngravitational waves. These constants have the same origin as the previous parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 . It should be noted that this action becomes non-local after integrating\nout the radion field. This fits the fact that KK effects are non-local usually. In principle, we can continue this calculation to any order of derivatives.\n\n8 The Answers\nWe have developed the low energy gradient expansion scheme to give insights into\nthe physics of the braneworld such as the black hole physics and the cosmology.\nIn particular, we have concentrated on the specific questions in this lecture. Here,\n\n\fAdS/CFT on the brane\n\n25\n\nwe summarize our answers obtained by the gradient expansion method. Our understanding of RS braneworlds would be also useful for other brane models.\n\n8.1 Single-brane model\nIs the Einstein theory recovered even in the non-linear regime?\nWe have obtained the effective theory at the lowest order as\n(4)\n\nG \u03bc\u03bd =\n\n\u03ba2 \u03bc\n2\nT \u03bd \u2212 \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd .\nl\nl\n\n(105)\n\nHere we have the correction \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd which can be interpreted as the dark radiation in\nthe cosmological situation.\nOn the other hand, in the linearized gravity, the conventional Einstein theory\nis recovered at low energy. This is because the out-going boundary condition is\nimposed. In other words, the asymptotic AdS boundary condition is imposed. In\nthe nonlinear case, this corresponds to the requirement that the dark radiation term\n\u03c7\u03bc\u03bd must be zero. For this boundary condition, the conventional Einstein theory is\nrecovered. Hence, the standard Friedmann equation holds.\nIn this sense, the answer is yes.\nHow does the AdS/CFT come into the braneworld?\nThe CFT emerges as the constant of integration which satisfies the trace anomaly\nrelation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1 2\n\u03bc\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\nR \u03b2 R \u03b1 \u2212 R \u2212 \u03b2 \u2737R .\n\u03c4 \u03bc =\u2212\n(106)\n8\n3\nThis constant can not be determined a priori. Here, the AdS/CFT correspondence\ncould come into the braneworld. Namely, if we identify some CFT with \u03c4\u03bc\u03bd , then\nwe can determine the boundary condition.\nHow are the AdS/CFT and geometrical approach related?\nThe key quantity in the geometric approach is obtained as\n(2)\n\n\u0014\n2\nE \u03bc \u03bd = l2 P \u03bc \u03bd + 2\u03c4 \u03bc \u03bd + 2\u03b1 S \u03bc \u03bd + \u03b2 K\n3\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n(107)\n\nThe above expression contains \u03c4\u03bc\u03bd which can be interpreted as the CFT matter.\nHence, once we know E\u03bc\u03bd , no enigma remains. In particular, P\u03bc\u03bd \u2248 \u03c0\u03bc\u03bd is independent of the \u03c4\u03bc\u03bd . In odd dimensions, there exists no trace anomaly, but P\u03bc\u03bd exists. In\n4-dimensions, \u03c0 \u03bc \u03bc accidentally coincides with the trace anomaly in CFT.\n\n\f26\n\nJiro Soda\n\nIt is interesting to note that the high energy and the Weyl term corrections found\nin the geometrical approach merge into the CFT matter correction found in the\nAdS/CFT approach.\n\n8.2 Two-brane model\nHow is the geometrical approach consistent with the Brans-Dicke picture?\nIn the geometrical approach, no radion seems to appear. On the other hand, the\nlinear theory predicts the radion as the crucial quantity. The resolution can be attained by obtaining E\u03bc\u03bd (\u03c7\u03bc\u03bd in our notation). The resultant expression\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2296\n\u03ba 2 (1 \u2212 \u03a8 ) \u2295 \u03bc\nT \u03bd + (1 \u2212 \u03a8 )T \u03bc \u03bd\n2\u03a8\n\u0011\nl h\u0010 |\u03bc\n\u2212\n\u03a8 |\u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd\u03bc\u03a8 |\u03b1 |\u03b1\n2\u03a8\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n1 \u03bc\n3\n\u03a8 |\u03bc \u03a8|\u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd \u03a8 |\u03b1 \u03a8|\u03b1\n+\n2(1 \u2212 \u03a8 )\n2\n\n\u03c7\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\n\ncontains the radion in an intriguing way. The dark radiation consists of the radion\nand the matter.\nWe have shown that the radion transforms the Einstein theory with Weyl correction into the conformally coupled scalar-tensor theory where the radion plays the\nrole of the scalar field. Thus, it turned out that the radion is hidden by the projected\nWeyl tensor E\u03bc\u03bd in the geometrical approach.\nWhat replaces the AdS/CFT correspondence in the two-brane model?\nIn the case of the single-brane model, the out-going boundary condition at the\nCauchy horizon is assumed. This conforms to AdS/CFT correspondence. Indeed,\nthe continuum KK-spectrum are projected on the brane as CFT matter.\nOn the other hand, the boundary condition in the two-brane system allows only\nthe discrete KK-spectrum. Hence, we can not expect CFT matter on the brane. Instead, the radion controls the bulk/brane correspondence in two-brane model. In\nfact, the higher derivative terms of the radion mimics the effect of the bulk geometry\n(KK-effect) as we have shown explicitly. Hence, the conventional AdS/CFT correspondence does not exist. Instead, there exists the AdS/CFT correspondence realized by the conformally coupled radion. The conformal coupling can be regarded as\na reflection of the symmetry of the bulk geometry.\nHere, I would like to mention D-brane inflation models proposed in [65]. There,\nthe inflaton is identified as the radion which is the distance between a D3-brane and\nanti-D3-branes as is shown in Fig.3. Naively, it seems possible to realize a slow\nroll inflation due to the warped geometry. However, our result of two-brane system\n\n\fAdS/CFT on the brane\n\n27\n\nFig. 3 The warped throat is attached to Calabi-Yau manifold. Anti-D3-branes are stacked at the tip\nof the warped throat. A D3-brane can move in the throat and the radion, i.e. the distance between\nthe D3-brane and anti-D3-branes, plays a role of the inflaton.\n\nsuggests the existence of the conformal coupling of the radion, which ruins the slow\nrole inflation of the model. In fact, the curvature coupling gives a large mass of the\ninflaton which causes the notorious eta problem. Hence, a fine tuning is unavoidable.\n\n9 AdS/CFT in Dilatonic braneworld\nIn the previous sections, we have considered RS braneworlds. If we take into account bulk fields, the pure AdS bulk would not be expected. Hence, it is interesting\nto see the role of AdS/CFT correspondence in those cases. In this section, we will\nconsider a bulk scalar field and call this kind of models dilatonic braneworlds [66].\nIn addition to the above theoretical interest, there is an phenomenological intererest in dilatonic braneworlds. Let us see how the inflationary universe can be\nrealized in the braneworld. The formula for the effective cosmological constant in\nthe braneworld reads\n\n\u039beff =\n\n\u03ba 4\u03c3 2 3\n\u2212 2 ,\n12\nl\n\n(108)\n\nwhere \u03c3 and l are the tension of the brane and the curvature scale in the bulk which\nis determined by the bulk vacuum energy, respectively. For \u03ba 2 \u03c3 = 6/l, we have\nMinkowski spacetime. In order to obtain the inflationary universe, we need the positive effective cosmological constant. In the braneworld model, there are two possi-\n\n\f28\n\nJiro Soda\n\nbilities. One is to increase the brane tension and the other is to increase l. The brane\ntension can be controlled by the scalar field on the brane. The bulk curvature scale l\ncan be controlled by the bulk scalar field. The former case is a natural extension of\nthe 4-dimensional inflationary scenario. The latter possibility is a novel one peculiar\nto the brane model. Recall that, in the superstring theory, scalar fields are ubiquitous. Indeed, the dilaton and moduli exists in the bulk generically, because they arise\nas the modes associated with the closed string. Moreover, when the supersymmetry\nis spontaneously broken, they may have the non-trivial potential. Hence, it is natural to consider the inflationary scenario driven by these fields [67, 68]. Therefore,\ndilatonic braneworlds are phenomenologically interesting. In this section, we would\nlike to discuss this dilatonic braneworld from the point of view of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence.\n\n9.1 Dilatonic Braneworld\nWe consider a S1 /Z2 orbifold spacetime with the two branes as the fixed points.\nIn this first Randall-Sundrum (RS1) model, the two flat 3-branes are embedded in\n\u2296\n\u2295\nAdS5 and the brane tensions given by \u03c3 = 6/(\u03ba 2 l) and \u03c3 = \u22126/(\u03ba 2l). Our system\nis described by the action\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\nZ\n1\n1 AB\n5 \u221a\n5 \u221a\nS=\n\u2212g\nR\n\u2212\n\u2212g\n\u2202\n\u03c6\u2202\n\u03c6\n+\nU(\n\u03c6\n)\ng\nd\nx\nd\nx\nB\nA\n2\u03ba 2\n2\nZ\nZ\np\np\ni\ni\nd 4 x \u2212gi-brane Lmatter\n, (109)\n\u2212 \u2211 \u03c3 d 4 x \u2212gi-brane + \u2211\ni=\u2295,\u2296\ni\n\ni=\u2295,\u2296\n\n-brane and \u03c3 are the induced metric and the brane tension on the i-brane,\nwhere gi\u03bc\u03bd\nrespectively. We assume the potential U(\u03c6 ) for the bulk scalar field takes the form\nU(\u03c6 ) = \u2212 \u03ba 26l2 +V (\u03c6 ) , where the first term is regarded as a 5-dimensional cosmological constant and the second term is an arbitrary potential function. The brane\ntension \u03c3 is tuned so that the effective cosmological constant on the brane vanishes.\nThe above setup realizes a flat braneworld after inflation ends and the field \u03c6 reaches\nthe minimum of its potential.\nInflation in the braneworld can be driven by a scalar field either on the brane or\nin the bulk. We derive the effective equations of motion which are useful for both\nmodels. Here, we begin with the single-brane system. Since we know the effective\n4-dimensional equations hold irrespective of the existence of other branes [46], the\nanalysis of the single-brane system is sufficient to derive the effective action for the\ntwo-brane system as we see in the next subsection.\nWe again adopt the Gaussian normal coordinate system to describe the geometry\nof the brane model; ds2 = dy2 + g\u03bc\u03bd (y, x\u03bc )dx\u03bc dx\u03bd , where the brane is assumed\nto be located at y = 0. Let us decompose the extrinsic curvature into the traceless\npart \u03a3 \u03bc\u03bd and the trace part K as K\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 12 g\u03bc\u03bd ,y = \u03a3 \u03bc\u03bd + 41 g\u03bc\u03bd K . Then, we can\n\n\fAdS/CFT on the brane\n\n29\n\nobtain the basic equations off the brane using these variables.

It should be stressed that the low energy does not necessarily\nimplies weak gravity on the brane. Under these circumstances, we can use a gradient\nexpansion scheme to solve the bulk equations of motion.\nAt zeroth order, we ignore matters on the brane. Then, from the junction condition (114), we have\n\n\f30\n\nJiro Soda\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n(0)\n\n3 \u03bc (0)\n\u03a3 \u03bc \u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bd K\n4\n\ny=0\n\n=\u2212\n\n\u03ba2 \u03bc\n\u03c3 \u03b4\u03bd .\n2\n\n(116)\n(0)\n\nAs the right hand side of (116) contains no traceless part, we get \u03a3 \u03bc \u03bd = 0 . We\nalso take the potential for the bulk scalar field U(\u03c6 ) to be \u22126/(\u03ba 2l2 ). We discard\nthe terms with 4-dimensional derivatives since one can neglect the long wavelength\nvariation in the direction of x\u03bc at low energies. Thus, the equations to be solved are\ngiven by\n(0)\n3 (0)2\n12\nK = \u03ba 2 (\u2202y \u03c6 )2 + 2 ,\n4\nl\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\n(117)\n\n(0)\n\n\u2202y2 \u03c6 \u2212 K \u2202y \u03c6 = 0 .\nh (0)i\nThe junction condition (115) at this order \u2202y \u03c6\n\n(118)\n= 0 tells us that the solution of\n\ny=0\n\n(0)\n\nEq.(118) must be \u03c6 = \u03b7 (x\u03bc ) , where \u03b7 (x\u03bc ) is an arbitrary constant of integration.\n(0)\n\nNow, the solution of Eq.(118) yields K = 4/l . Other Eqs. (111) and (112) are\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\ntrivially satisfied at zeroth order. Using the definition K \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd ,y /2, we have\nthe lowest order metric\n(0)\n\ng \u03bc\u03bd (y, x\u03bc ) = b2 (y) h\u03bc\u03bd (x\u03bc ),\n\nb(y) \u2261 e\u2212y/l ,\n\n(119)\n\nwhere the induced metric on the brane, h \u03bc\u03bd \u2261 g\u03bc\u03bd (y = 0, x\u03bc ), arises as a constant of\nintegration. The junction condition for the induced metric (116) merely implies well\nknown relation \u03ba 2 \u03c3 = 6/l and that for the scalar field (115) is trivially satisfied.\nAt this leading order analysis, we can not determine the constants of integration\nh \u03bc\u03bd (x\u03bc ) and \u03b7 (x\u03bc ) which are constant as far as the short length scale l variations are\nconcerned, but are allowed to vary over the long wavelength scale. These constants\nshould be constrained by the next order analysis.\nNow, we take into account the effect of both the bulk scalar field and the matter\non the brane perturbatively. Our iteration scheme is to write the metric g\u03bc\u03bd and the\nscalar field \u03c6 as a sum of local tensors built out of the induced metric and the induced\nscalar field on the brane, in the order of expansion parameters, that is, O((Rl2 )n ) and\nO(\u03ba 2 l2V (\u03c6 ))n , n = 0, 1, 2, * * * [46].

The point is the fact that the equations of motion on\neach brane take the same form if we use the induced metric on each brane [46].

When we set the position of the positive\ntension brane at y = 0, that of the negative tension brane \u0233 in general depends on\nx\u03bc , i.e. \u0233 = \u0233(x\u03bc ). Hence, the warp factor at the negative tension brane \u03a9 (x\u03bc ) \u2261\nb(\u0233(x)) also depends on x\u03bc . Because the metric always comes into equations with\nderivatives, the zeroth order relation is enough in this first order discussion. Hence,\nthe metric on the positive tension brane is related to the metric on the negative\ntension brane as f \u03bc\u03bd = \u03a9 2 h\u03bc\u03bd .\nAlthough Eqs.

Notice that the scalar\nfield takes the same value for both branes at this order. Eliminating the dark source\nC from these Eqs.

Thus, we\nfound the radion field couples with the induced metric and the induced scalar field\non the brane non-trivially. Surprisingly, at this order, the nonlocality of \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd and C\nare eliminated by the radion. We see the radion has a conformal coupling. However,\nin the present case, the radion couples to the dilaton field which breaks a conformal\ninvariance. Hence, this gives non-conformal holography.\nAs this is a closed system, we can analyze a primordial spectrum to predict the\n\u03bc\ncosmic background fluctuation spectrum [69]. Interestingly, \u03c7\u03bd and C vanishes in\nthe single brane limit, \u03a8 \u2192 1, as can be seen from (130) and (135). The dynamics is\nsimply governed by Einstein theory with the single scalar field. Therefore, we can\nconclude that the bulk inflaton can drive inflation when the slow role conditions are\nsatisfied.\n\n9.3 AdS/CFT and KK corrections: Single-brane cases\nIt would be important to take into account the KK effects as corrections to the leading order result. It can be accomplished in the single-brane models.

Using the formalism, I have tried to explain how the AdS/CFT correspondence is related to the braneworld models.\nIn the case of the RS single-brane model, we clarified when the conventional\nEinstein equations hold at low energy. Moreover, we revealed the relation between\nthe geometrical and the AdS/CFT correspondence approach using the gradient expansion method. We have shown that the high energy and the Weyl term corrections\nfound in the geometrical approach correspond to the CFT matter corrections found\nin the AdS/CFT approach.\nIn the case of the RS two-brane sysytem, we showed that the AdS/CFT correspondence plays an important role in the sense that the low energy effective field\ntheory can be described by the conformally coupled scalar-tensor theory where the\nradion plays the role of the scalar field. We also presented the symmetry method to\nderive KK corrections in the two-brane system.\nThese effective theories for RS braneworlds can be used to make cosmological\npredictions. More importantly, it turned out that the gradient expansion method provides a unified view of RS braneworlds.\nWe have also considered the bulk scalar field with a nontrivial potential and derived the non-linear low energy effective action for the dilatonic two-brane model\nusing the gradient expansion method. As a result, we have shown that the effective\ntheory reduces to the scalar-tensor theory with the non-trivial coupling between the\nradion and the bulk scalar field. Since the radion has a conformal coupling, the conformal symmetry is relevant even for the dilatonic braneworlds. In this sense, the\nAdS/CFT correspondence is related to dilatonic braneworlds. However, the radion\n\n\fAdS/CFT on the brane\n\n35\n\ncouples to the scalar field which is non-conformal. Hence, the conformal invariance\nis violated.\nOur phenomenological motivation to consider dilatonic braneworlds was a possibility of the bulk inflaton. Concerning to this issue, taking into account the fact\nthat \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd and C becomes zero when two branes get separated infinitely, one can conclude that the bulk inflaton can drive the inflation on the brane as far as the slow roll\nconditions are satisfied. We also obtained KK corrections in the single brane limit\nwhich contain CFT corrections.\nThese results tell us that there exist profound relations between braneworlds and\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence, although the correspondence is slightly deformed in\nthe dilatonic cases.\nIn this lecture, we have considered only codimesion-one braneworlds. It is important to extend the analysis to higher codimension models [73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78,\n79, 80, 81, 82]. It is intriguing to study a role of the AdS/CFT correspondence in\nthese higher codimension braneworlds.\nAcknowledgements I would like to thank Sugumi Kanno for collaborations on which this lecture is based and useful comments on the manuscript.
