It is described with the\nrelation:\n\u2206Bij = N ijklm\u03c3 kl Em + M ijklmn\u03c3 kl Em En ,\n(1)\nwhere Nijklm is a fifth-rank polar tensor with the\ninternal symmetry [V2]2V, while Mijklmn is a\npolar tensor of a rank six with the internal\nsymmetry [V2]3. It follows from the symmetry\nof the Nijklm tensor that the PEO effect linear in\nelectric field can exist only in noncentrosymmetric crystals. This effect may be\npresented also as a change in the electrooptic\n\n70\n\n(EO) coefficients under the action of mechanical\nstress:\n\u2206rijm = N ijmkl\u03c3 kl ,\n(2)\nor, equivalently, a change in the piezooptic (PO)\ncoefficients under the action of electric field:\n\u2206\u03c0 ijkl = N ijklm Em .\n(3)\nThe PEO effect is not the only combined\neffect of the parametric crystal optics. One can\nremind a piezoelectrogyration effect found by\nH-J.Weber et al [2] and a so-called\n\"magnetoelectrogyration\" effect studied by\nW.Kaminsky et al [3] in the alum crystals.\nFurthermore, the changes in the Faraday\ncoefficients under the electric field and\nspontaneous polarization in Pb5Ge3O11 crystals\nobserved by O.Vlokh et al [4], which have been\nlater explained in [5] and described also by\nI.Chupis [6], seem to be a relevant example, too.\nBesides, the effects just mentioned describe the\n\nUkr. J. Phys. Opt. V5. No2\n\n\fCombined Piezoelectrooptic Effect in Rochelle Salt at the Phase Transition\n\nchanges in imaginary part of the dielectric\npermeability tensor induced by mutual influence\nof different fields, while the effect of PEO (i.e.,\nthe change in the refractive indices) is related to\nreal part of this tensor and so should be greater.\nOne of particular manifestations of the PEO\neffect in the course of phase transitions in the\nproper ferroelectric crystals may be a change in\nthe PO coefficients occurring with the onset of\nspontaneous polarization P(s)m [7]:\n\n\u2206\u03c0 ijkl = N ( s ) ijklm Pm( s ) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere N(s)ijklm is taken for the paraelectric phase.\nThe same should be true of the EO coefficients\nin the proper ferroelastic crystals. The change in\nthe EO and PO coefficients at the phase\ntransition in ferroelectric-ferroelastic crystals\nshould depend on both the spontaneous\npolarization and deformation (as far as we\nknow, the combined PEO effect has been\nstudied only in proper ferroelectrics up to now).\nOn the other side, due to piezoelectric coupling\nbetween the spontaneous polarization and\nspontaneous deformation in the ferroelectricferroelastic crystals, one can expect appearance\nof links between the coefficients of the\ncombined PEO effect and the usual Pockels or\nKerr coefficients and the PO coefficients (see,\ne.g., [8] where the relations between the PO,\nEO, piezogyration and electrogyration effects\nhave been obtained and experimentally verified\nfor ferroelectrics-ferroelastics). Thus, the\npresent work is devoted to study of PEO effect\nat ferroelectric-ferroelastic phase transition on\nthe example of Rochelle salt crystals.\n\nExperimental\nRochelle salt crystals (NaKC4H4O6\u00d74H2NH2O)\npossess two ferroelectric-ferroelastic phase\ntransitions with the change of point symmetry\n222F2F222 at Tc1=297K and Tc2=255K (see,\ne.g., [9]). The first transition is a direct phase\ntransformation to the ferroelectric-ferroelastic\nphase with the point symmetry group 2, while\nthe second one is re-entrant and results in\n\nUkr. J. Phys. Opt. V5. No2\n\nrepairing the paraphase with the point symmetry\n222.\nNaKC4H4O6\u00d74H2NH2O single crystals with\nthe flat plane-parallel faces perpendicular to\n<100> (the axis of spontaneous polarization),\n<011> and < 01 1 > directions were polished\nwith the diamond powders and paste. The\nradiation of He-Ne laser with the wavelength of\n632.8nm was propagated along < 01 1 >\ndirection. The electric field was directed along\n<100> axis using the copper electrodes and the\nmechanical stress was applied along <011>\ndirection. The crystal was placed into a specially\ndesigned furnace, providing the accuracy of\ntemperature stabilization of about 0.1K. The\nchanges in the birefringence under the\napplication of electric field were measured with\nthe Senarmont method for different magnitudes\nof applied mechanical stresses, and vice versa.\nWe studied the behaviour of the PEO effect only\nat the high-temperature phase transition, i.e. the\ndirect transformation to the ferroelectricferroelastic phase. The PO and the EO\ncoefficients were calculated for the case of\nsingle-domain state of samples, i.e. for the data\ntaken from outside the hysteresis loop region.\n\nResults and discussion\nLet us analyse the changes in the optical\nindicatrix for the point groups 222 and 2 and the\nmentioned experimental geometry. The PO and\nEO tensors for these groups are available, e.g.,\nin [10], while the fifth- and sixth-rank tensors\nare still necessary to derive.

The temperature\ndependence of the effective PO coefficient\nmeasured on electrically shorted sample and\ncalculated on the basis of Eqs. (7) and (9) is\npresented in Figure 1.\nOne can see that the increment of this\ncoefficient appearing at the phase transition\ndepends linearly on temperature (if we do not\ntake into account a diffuse character of the phase\ntransition). On the other hand, the dependence of\n\u03c0eff on the spontaneous polarization (the data for\ntemperature dependence of the spontaneous\npolarization are taken from [11]) is nonlinear\n(see Figure 2a).\nIt is possible to distinguish between the\nlinear and quadratic parts of this dependence\n(see Figure 2b) and calculate the corresponding\ncoefficients of the PEO effect induced by\nspontaneous polarization, using Eq.

As seen\nfrom Eqs.

The\nlinear part of the dependence is connected with\nthe appearance of coefficients \u03c042 and \u03c043 in the\nferroelectric-ferroelastic phase.\nThe PO hysteresis loops obtained at 295K\nat different values of the biasing field are\npresented in Figure 3. With increasing biasing\nfield, one can observe the increase in the size of\nhysteresis, followed by its subsequent decrease.\nIt is necessary to note that an electromechanical\nhysteresis should also exist in ferroelectricferroelastic crystals. Therefore, the observed\neffect becomes quite understandable i.e., the\n\napplication of electric field leads to changing the\nspontaneous deformation in the limit of\n\"butterfly-like\" hysteresis. On the other side, the\ndependence of changes in the PO coefficient on\nthe electric field may be obtained from the\nslopes of linear dependences of the\nbirefringence induced by mechanical stresses at\ndifferent electric field, out of the hysteresis loop\nregion. This dependence, which is represented in\nFigure 4, turns out to be linear.\nUsing the data of Figure 4 and Eq. (14), it\nis possible to determine the effective coefficient\nof the PEO effect. Its value equals to\nNeff=1.55\u00d710-17Vm/N.\nThe temperature dependences of EO\n\nFig. 3.

As one can easily see, the magnitude of\nEO coefficient that has been calculated with the\naid of Eq. (6) increases, due to the PEO effect,\nwhen the compressive stress is applied. The\neffective coefficient of the combined effect is\nNeff=1.46\u00d710-17Vm/N at 295K (see Eqs. (11) and\n(12)). It is worthwhile that we have got rather\nclose values for the coefficients Neff determined\nfrom the measurements of both the PO coefficient change under the electric field and the EO\ncoefficient change under the mechanical stress.\nIt is seen from Figure 5 that the difference\nbetween the curves of EO coefficients obtained\nat different stresses gradually disappears approximately at 305K. The temperature dependence\nof the coefficient Neff exhibits a maximum in the\nvicinity of the diffuse phase transition and approaches zero at increasing temperature (see Figure 6). Since the elastic stiffness does not possess any anomalies at the phase transition, one\ncan expect that the anomalous dependence of\nNeff is associated only with a similar anomaly of\nthe dielectric permitivity \u03b51 (see, e.g., [12]). It is\ninteresting to notice that the actual range for the\ncoefficient N(s)eff=Neff\u03b51(\u03b51-1)=(1.12\u223c1.31)\u00d7109 4\nm /NC in the paraphase, re-calculated with the\ndata shown in Figure 6, includes the value\n(N(s)421+N(s)431)=1.25\u00d710-9m4/NC obtained on the\n\nFig. 6.

Hence, one can see that our\ncoefficients obtained in different experiments do\ncoincide, in agreement with the predictions of\nphenomenology.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, our studies for the PEO\neffect in ferroelectric-ferroelastic Rochelle salt\ncrystals have permitted us to calculate and\ncompare the values of coefficients of the\ncombined\neffect\nobtained\nfrom\nthe\nmeasurements of the EO coefficient change\nunder the action of mechanical stress and the PO\ncoefficient change due to the effect of electric\nfield (or spontaneous polarization). It has been\nexperimentally shown that both coefficients are\nthe same, as it is predicted by the theory. The\ntemperature dependence of coefficient of the\ncombined PEO effect is obtained. It has been\nalso revealed that the change in the PO\ncoefficients at the phase transition in Rochelle\nsalt crystals may be satisfactorily explained by\nthe linear and quadratic PEO effects induced by\nspontaneous polarization.\n\nAcknowledgement\nFig. 5.
