CORTEEL\n\nPermutation tableaux are new objects that come from the enumeration of the\ntotally positive Grassmannian cells [4, 7]. Surprisingly they are also connected\nto a statistical physics model called the Partially ASymmetric Exclusion Process\n[1, 2, 3].\nOur main interest here is that these tableaux are in bijection with permutations. To our knowledge only one bijection between permutations and permutation\ntableaux is known and appeared in [5], although several bijections between a subclass called Catalan tableaux and diverse objects counted by Catalan numbers are\nknown [6]. This bijection between permutations and permutation tableaux is quite\ncomplicated; but a lot of statistics of the permutation (weak exceedances, crossings\n[1], alignments [7]. . . ) can be read from the tableau. In particular the number\nof weak exceedances of the permutation corresponds to the number of rows of the\ntableau. See [5] for many more details.\nOur goal here is therefore to present a simple bijection between permutations and\npermutation tableaux that maps the descents of the permutation to the columns of\nthe tableau. Our result is\nTheorem 1. There exists a bijection between permutations of {1, . . . , n} with k\ndescents and permutation tableaux of length n with k columns.\nWe first start with a few definitions. A descent of a permutation \u03c3 of a set S\nis an entry i \u2208 S such that if \u03c3(j) = i then \u03c3(j) > \u03c3(j + 1). For example, if\n\u03c3 = (2, 4, 8, 5, 1, 6, 3, 7) and S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, then 5,6 and 8 are the descents\nof \u03c3.\nAs in [5], a permutation tableau T is a shape (the Ferrers diagram of a partition)\ntogether with a filling of the cells with 0's and 1's such that the following properties\nhold:\n(1) Each column contains at least one 1.\n(2) There is no 0 which has a 1 above it in the same column and a 1 to its left\nin the same row.\nAn example of a permutation tableau is given in Figure 1. Different statistics on\npermutation tableaux were defined in [3, 5]. We list a few here. The length of\na tableau is the half perimeter of its shape. A zero in a permutation tableau is\nrestricted if there is a one above it in the same column. A row is unrestricted if it\ndoes not contain a restricted entry. A restricted zero is a rightmost restricted zero\nif it is restricted and it has no restricted zero to its right in the same row.\nWe label the boundary of the shape of the tableau from 1 to its length, going\nfrom top-right to bottom-left. See Figure 1. This labels the rows and the columns :\na South (resp. West) step labelled by i gives the label i to this row (resp. column).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSYLVIE CORTEEL\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n6\n7\n\n5\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n8\n\nFigure 1. Example of a permutation tableau\nThe cell (i, j) of the tableau corresponds the cell that is in the row labelled by i\nand the column labelled by j.\nIn Figure 1, a permutation tableau of shape (3, 3, 3, 3, 1) and length 8 is given.\nThe rows 1,3 and 7 are unrestricted and the rows 2 and 4 are restricted. The\nrightmost restricted zeros are in cells (2, 8) and (4, 8).\nWe are now ready to present the bijection. Let \u03c3 be a permutation of {1, . . . , n}\nand let T be its image. We first draw the shape of the tableau T . For i from 1 to\nn, we draw a West step if i is a descent and a South step otherwise. An example\nfor \u03c3 = (2, 4, 8, 5, 1, 6, 3, 7) is given in Figure 1, as 5,6 and 8 are the descents of \u03c3.\nNow let us fill the cells of the tableau T . Let (i, j) be the Eastmost and Southmost\ncell of the tableau T that is not filled:\n\u2022 if i and j are not adjacent in the permutation \u03c3 then fill the cell (i, j) with\na one.\n\u2022 otherwise\n\u2013 if i is before j, then fill all the empty cells of row i with zeros and\ndelete i from the permutation \u03c3.\n\u2013 otherwise fill cell (i, j) with a one and all the empty cells of column j\nwith zeros and delete j from the permutation \u03c3.\nAt the end of this process, T is filled and \u03c3 is the list of the labels of the unrestricted rows of T in increasing order. It is easy to check that T is a permutation\ntableau and that i is a descent in \u03c3 if and only if there is a column labelled by i in T .\nExample 1. We start with \u03c3 = (2, 4, 8, 5, 1, 6, 3, 7), and we draw the shape of\nT (see Figure 1). We first fill cell (4, 5) and fill it with a 1, as 4 and 5 are not\nadjacent. We also fill cells (3, 5) and (2, 5) with ones. We fill (1,5) with a one and\ndelete 5 from the permutation. The permutation is now \u03c3 = (2, 4, 8, 1, 6, 3, 7). We\nfill cell (4, 6) with a one and then cell (3, 6) with a one and all the cells above in\nthis column with a zero and delete 6 from the permutation. The permutation is\nnow \u03c3 = (2, 4, 8, 1, 3, 7). Then cell (7, 8) gets a one, cell (4, 8) gets a zero and 4 is\ndeleted. The permutation is now \u03c3 = (2, 8, 1, 3, 7). Finally cell (3, 8) gets a one, cell\n(2, 8) gets a zero and 2 is deleted. The permutation is now (8, 1, 3, 7). Cell (1, 8)\ngets a one and all the cells above get a zero and 8 is deleted. The permutation is\nfinally (1, 3, 7). The result is given in Figure 1.\nExample 2. Starting with the permutation (8, 5, 4, 7, 2, 3, 1, 6), we first draw the\nshape of the tableau T (Figure 2). We first fill cell (2,3) and all the cells to its left\nwith zeros and delete 2 from the permutation. Then we add a one in cell (1,3) and\ndelete 3 from the permutation. Then we fill cell (4,5) with a one and all the cells\nabove with zeros and delete 5 from the permutation. Then we fill cell (6,7) with a\none and fill cell (4,6) and all the cells to its left with zeros and delete 4 from the\npermutation. Then we fill cell (1,7) with a one and delete 7 from the permutation.\n\n\fA SIMPLE BIJECTION BETWEEN PERMUTATION TABLEAUX AND PERMUTATIONS\n\n3\n\nFinally we fill cell (6,8) and cell (1,8) with a one and delete 8 from the permutation.\nSee Figure 2.\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n1 0 1\n0 0 0\n0 1 43\n1 65\n\n8\n\n7\n\n1\n2\n\nFigure 2. Image of the permutation (8, 5, 4, 7, 2, 3, 1, 6).\nThe reverse is as easy to define. We start with the tableau T . Then we initialize\nthe permutation \u03c3 to the list of the labels of the unrestricted rows in increasing\norder. Now for each column, starting from the left proceeding to the right, if the\ncolumn is labelled by j and if (i, j) is the topmost one of the column then we add\nj to the left of i in the permutation \u03c3. Moreover if column j contains rightmost\nrestricted zeros in rows i1 , . . . , ik then we add i1 , . . . , ik in increasing order to the\nleft of j in the permutation \u03c3. It is easy to see that this is the reverse mapping.\nExample 1. We start with the tableau in Figure 1. The unrestricted rows are\nrows 1,3 and 7. The rightmost restricted zeros are in cells (2, 8) and (4, 8). We start\nwith the permutation (1, 3, 7), We add 8 to the left of 1 and add 2 and 4 to the\nleft of 8. We get (2, 4, 8, 1, 3, 7). We add 6 to the left of 3 and get (2, 4, 8, 1, 6, 3, 7).\nFinally we add 5 to the left of 1. The permutation is (2, 4, 8, 5, 1, 6, 3, 7).\nExample 2. We start with the tableau in Figure 2. The unrestricted rows are\nrows 1 and 6. The rightmost restricted zeros are in cells (4, 7) and (2, 3). We start\nwith the permutation (1, 6). We add 8 to the left of 1 and get (8, 1, 6). We add 7\nto the left of 1 and 4 to the left of 7 and get (8, 4, 7, 1, 6). We then add 5 to the left\nof 4 and get (8, 5, 4, 7, 1, 6). Finally we add 3 to the left of 1 and 2 to the left of 3.\nThe result is (8, 5, 4, 7, 2, 3, 1, 6).\nReferences\n[1] S. Corteel: Crossings and alignments of permutations, Adv. in Appl.
