By measuring the rotation\nthat results from a known external torque, we compute the rotational\ndrag, from which we deduce the rheological properties of the interface.\nNotably, our apparatus enable direct interfacial visualization while the\nprobes are torqued.\nIn this fluid dynamics video, we directly visualize dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine(DPPC) monolayers at the air-water interface while\nshearing. At about 9 mN/m, DPPC exhibits a liquid condensed(LC)\nphase where liquid crystalline domains are compressed each other, and\nseparated by grain boundaries.
