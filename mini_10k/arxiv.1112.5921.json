Currently, there is insufficient scientific data, which\nrepresents the arrangement of amino acid in the proteins based on atomic composition. Our deep\nobservational and analytical studies indicate that the distribution of carbon in the protein\nsequence can bring differences in the function of proteins. Until now, it is believed that carbon\ncontent elicits the hydrophobic interactions in proteins. This distinct feature classifies normal\nproteins and viral proteins based on the carbon content. One of the objectives of this\ninvestigation is to show the significance of carbon composition in protein structure evaluation.\nSince, the level of perceived benefit is likely to be high in the field of proteomics for structural\nanalysis, the position of this paper is to prioritize only the avian viral protein sequences based on\ncarbon content when compared with the normal protein sequences. Here, we present the\nevaluation of carbon along the avian protein sequence in order to show the differences in the\ndistribution of carbon using the software technology. The evaluation results provide a deep view\nin to the molecular structure of avian viral protein, which can further enable the progress of\nresearch in the proteomics domain based on carbon classification. This systematic approach in\ncomputing carbon level of avian viruses aim towards the benefit of individual, regional and\nglobal health in addition to opening of further effective research on avian viral protein based on\nthe aforementioned results.\nKeywords: Carbon distribution, Avian virus, Protein sequence, Atomic composition and\nStructure evaluation.\n\n\f2\n\n1. Introduction:\nMost of the studies have unraveled many aspects of protein structural composition where it is\nindicated that Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorus are the main elements involved in the formation of\nmRNAs and proteins [1]. In contrast, the level of carbon distribution along the protein sequence\nvaries between normal and viral proteins, though it is organized with same number of amino\nacids but it makes difference with the arrangement of amino acid. Ultimately ends in different\nbiological function [2]. In a situation where influenza pandemic is considered imminent or\nunderway, a profound investigation in to the avian viral protein structure is fundamental to\ndemonstrate atomic composition for better understanding the differences of protein structure for\nfurther research. In this case study, some of the avian viral proteins from different regions is\npreferred for the analysis based on carbon content. Although the stability and folding nature of\nprotein is accompanied with the carbon content, it is been reported that 31.44% carbon induces\nthe stable nature of proteins [3]. Despite the fact, while come across the preventive measures to\ncounter arrest the spread of seasonal human influenza, vaccination is the only consort to\nminimize the rate of infection [4]. From the observational studies, it is found that viral RNA\nmutates and reassorts and finally develops resistance against vaccines [5]. Henceforth, there\narises the problem of vaccine efficacy. In such scenarios, the complete viral protein structure\nevaluation at the atomic level will help to provoke the possibility in bringing down the mortality\nrate by further effective research in to the molecular level and can address new strategies in\ncontrolling the spread of disease. Moreover what could be the difference ratio between the\nspecies based on carbon content? What is the carbon composition of avian viral protein? Will\nthat be stable with 31.44% carbon? To address these issues, the systematic approach is been\ndeveloped to identify differences in avian viral protein sequences.\n2. Background:\nAs outlined in the preceding reports on carbon content, it is evident that the distribution of\ncarbon plays an important role in gene expression and protein stability. Further studies illustrates\nthat the availability of carbon in the genes influences evolution by gene duplication [6]. In\ncontrast to perception, depending on biosynthetic pathways of proteins, each protein found to\nhave assigned value of energetic cost based on the arrangement of amino acids. The differences\nin the cost of amino acids between different organisms can influence evolutionary implications\non different species [7]. Though variations observed in many of the atomic contents of protein,\nlarger variation observed in the carbon atom distribution along the sequence [8].\nUpon consideration, the structural properties of influenza are essential for this case study. The\navian viruses attack the upper respiratory tract and increase the risk factors for humans to\nbecome infected. Avian viruses usually get transmitted through aerosols or infected birds [9].\nOnce entering in to the respiratory tract of the host, it replicates inside the respiratory tract and\ndamages the host cell [10]. The interest of this systematic approach mainly projects on avian\nviral envelope proteins as there is huge demand in structure evaluation studies. It is been\n\n\f3\n\nobserved that there are two envelope glyco proteins named Hemagglutinin(HA) and\nNeuraminidase(NA) based on which the influenza virus is classified in to Influenza A and B\nviruses. Both the viruses possess different antigenic characteristics [11]. The protein HA\nmediates binding of virus to the host cell and facilitates the entry of viral RNA in to the host cell\nand the protein NA is involved in the release of progeny virus from the infected cell [12]. The\nlongevity of viral infection depend mainly on the surface antigens and it is likely found to have\nsubtypes ranging from H1 to H16 and N1 to N9 [13]. Currently avian viruses acquires the\ncapacity for sustained person to person transmission and pretense a high risk to human being\nwith increased mortality rate [14].\nEfforts are under way to improve the qualitative study on elemental composition of nucleic acids\nand proteins of avian viruses as there is lack of information. The available scientific evidence\nsays that the amino acids coded by the nucleic acids are correlated with its elemental\ncomposition [15]. Earlier analytical studies on chemical properties of amino acids and their\nanticodons related to the evolution of genetic code is available which demonstrates the\ncorrelation between the anticodons and their atomic composition [16, 17 and 18]. Further studies\nreveal that the carbon content in proteins is correlated with the genome base composition where\nit is observed that high GC genome content is related to low carbon content of proteins [19].\nHowever the variations in the carbon content may or may not induce biochemical reactions. This\nwork projects in to the differences in the carbon content of avian viral protein hemagglutinin just\nto show whether the carbon content is high or low and also the possibility of hydrophobic\ninteraction between the molecules based on the carbon distribution along the protein sequence.\n3. Methodology:\nThe validation of proteome carbon has gained its importance in recent research as it plays main\nrole in maintaining the stability of proteins. The purpose of this work is to identify the carbon\ncomposition of avian viral protein sequences from different parts of Asia to analyze the\ndifference in the carbon content. How far the distribution of carbon affects the structure of avian\nviral proteins? and what could be the significant effect based on high or low carbon content? For\nthat reason, the application of software program CARBANA was used for this investigation.\nThe 6 avian viral protein sequences were retrieved from the NCBI-Influenza virus resource\n(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/FLU.html). Awaiting biological researches in this field\ndepend mostly on this online available database and have been used here for the selection of viral\nstrains for the analysis (Table 1).\nCARBANA was accessed through www.rajasekaran.net.in/tools/carbana.html for computing\ncarbon composition of the selected viral strains. The fasta sequence of all the viral proteins was\ndownloaded from the Influenza Virus Resource for the computation and program was allowed to\nrun with the limited window size 700 as the amino acid number of all the virus strain is strictly\nwithin the windows size limit. The computed carbon properties of the given sequences were\nobserved and viewed graphically (Fig 1).\n\n\f4\n\nTable 1: Selected avian viral strains for the carbon analysis.\nS.No\n\nStrain Name\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nA/Korean native chicken/Korea/K040110/2010\nA/Mallard duck/Korea/W401/2011\nA/Muscovy duck/Fujian/FZ01/2008\nA/chicken/Anhui/A28/2011\nA/chicken/Bangladesh/11rs1984-2/2011\nA/duck/Anhui/B25/2010\n\nInfluenza\nSubtypes\nH9N2\nH5N1\nH6N6\nH9N2\nH5N1\nH9N2\n\nA\n\nGenbank ID\n\nTarget protein\n\nAEF10493.1\nAEJ90156.1\nADF29678.1\nAEQ72917.1\nAEQ50029.1\nAEQ73377.1\n\nHA\nHA\nHA\nHA\nHA\nHA\n\n4. Results and Discussion:\nThe evaluation of carbon composition of avian viral proteins could have a significant impact in\nfurther research implications towards control measures of Influenza pandemics. In contrast to\nperception, it is easy to predict the stability of proteins with the carbon content. As discussed\nearlier, the folding of proteins depend on the carbon content and ultimately results in some\nbiological function [20]. The criterion is to analyze whether the avian viruses possess same\ncarbon content or does it shows any differences. Our analysis illustrates the distribution of\ncarbon and the differences based on the standard carbon percentage 31.44% to show whether the\nselected group of proteins have significantly different elemental composition using software\ntechnology. Fig 1 illustrates the carbon % in 6 different influenza viruses graphically. From the\nobserved results, each protein found to have high and low carbon contents which are illustrated\nin the table below.\nTable 2: Distribution of carbon observed in 6 avian viral protein sequences with its amino acid\nnumber.\nS.No\n\n1.\n\nGraphical\nfigure\n(From fig 1)\n1a\n\n2.\n\n1b\n\n3.\n\n1c\n\n4.\n\n1d\n\n5.\n\n1e\n\n6.\n\n1f\n\nAminoacid Number\n\n35, 36,40,44,45,49,53,54,57, 58, 62, 66, 67, 71.\n\nHighest\ncarbon\ncontent\nNil\n\nLowest\nCarbon\nContent\n26.29\n\n31 and 32\n\n43.82\n\nNil\n\n438\n78\n51, 395, 396 478, 522, 524, 569, 570, 573, 334, 397\n73\n374, 375 and 420\n222 and 223\n335\n190,468,470 and 474\n339, 340, 341, 378, 467 and 507\n220\n\nNil\n46.22\nNil\n45.82\nNil\n36.65\nNil\n36.25\nNil\n37.45\n\n27.09\nNil\n28.69\n28.29\nNil\n27.49\nNil\n28.29\nNil\n\nTable 2 characterize the carbon content along the sequence corresponding to the position of\naminoacid. The lowest carbon content in all the viral proteins indicates that there is no\nhydrophobic interaction and may not involve in any biochemical reactions. In contrast, the\nhighest carbon content in the proteins may instigate or restrain biological functions. Except some\n\n\f5\n\npart of the aminoacids, all the other aminoacids possess high as well as low carbon content\nwhich makes difference when compared to the normal stable proteins.\n\nFigure 1: Carbon composition of avian viral protein HA from different regions.\n5. Conclusion:\nTaken together the carbon distribution and the amino acid number, our analyses help explain\nhow the carbon content affects the nature of proteins. In general, it is observed that the avian\nviral proteins have high carbon content with which it differs from the other normal proteins. As it\nhas got high carbon content, it will tend to have high amino acid cost and consequently plays\nvital role in evolution by gene duplication. So far the investigation of carbon content confers that\n31.44% is needed for stable nature of normal proteins for non covalent interactions with other\nbiomolecules. The availability of high carbon content in avian viral proteins may be encountered\nas disordered protein which may initiate or suppress biological functions. As the proteins\ninvolved in this approach are virulent in nature and spread diseases among population, the\naforementioned report on carbon composition would help prevail over the difficulties by further\neffective research targeting transformation of disorder to ordered proteins and vice versa for the\nbetterment of public health.\n6.
