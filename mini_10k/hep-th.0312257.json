Results\nand techniques of string/D-brane theory, being applied to non-Abelian field theories\n(both, supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric), have recently generated numerous\npredictions for gauge theories at strong coupling. If the latter are, in a sense, dual\nto string/D-brane theory - as is generally believed to be the case - they must\nsupport domain walls (of the D-brane type) [1], and we know, they do [2, 3]. In\naddition, string/D-brane theory teaches us that a fundamental string that starts on\na confined quark, can end on the domain wall [1].\nIn our previous paper [4] we embarked on the studies of field-theoretic prototypes\nof D branes/strings. To this end we considered (2+1)-dimensional domain walls\nin (3+1)-dimensional N = 2 SQCD with the SU(2) gauge group (and Nf = 2\nflavors of fundamental hypermultiplets - quarks), perturbed by a small mass term\nof the adjoint matter. In fact, our analysis reduced to that of the effective lowenergy N = 2 SQED with a (generalized) Fayet-Iliopoulos term. We found 1/2\nBPS-saturated domain wall solution interpolating between two quark vacua at weak\ncoupling. The main finding was the localization of a U(1) gauge field on this domain\nwall. We also demonstrated that the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen magnetic flux tube\ncan end on the wall.\nThe goal of the present work is the extension of the above results. Now we want\nto consider composite walls, analogs of a stack of D branes, to see that they localize\nnon-Abelian gauge fields, say U(2). Our second task - as important to us as the\nfirst one - is the study of non-Abelian flux tubes, and, especially, how they end on\nthe walls. In this way we continue the line of research initiated in Refs. [5, 6, 7].\nThe set up that will provide us with the appropriate tools is the same as in the\nprevious paper [4], namely N = 2 SQCD analyzed by Seiberg and Witten [8, 9].\nCompared to Ref. [4] we will deal with a somewhat different version, however. We\nwill start from the SU(3) theory with four \"quark\" hypermultiplets (Nf = 4) in the\nfundamental representation. The SU(3) gauge group will be spontaneously broken\ndown to SU(2)\u00d7U(1) at a large scale m where m \u223c mA = m, A = 1, 2, 3, 4, and\nm1 , m2 , m3 and m4 are the mass terms ascribed to the four quark flavors that\nare present in the model. Generically, all mA 's are different, but we will choose a\nnon-generic configuration.\nAlthough SU(3) N = 2 SQCD provides a conceptual skeleton for our set up,\nin essence its role is to stay behind the scene, as a motivating factor. Since the\ngauge SU(3) group will be broken at the largest scale relevant to the model, and the\nbulk of our present work refers to lower scales, in practice our set up is based on\nSU(2)\u00d7U(1) gauge model with four quark hypermultiplets and unbroken N = 2 .\nThe underlying SU(3) N = 2 SQCD which one may or may not keep in mind in\nreading this paper, will be referred to as the \"prototheory.\"\n2\n\n\fWith four flavors, the SU(2) subsector is conformal; therefore the problem we\naddress can be fully analyzed in the weak coupling regime. In fact, two of four\nquarks will be just spectators while the other two will play a nontrivial role in the\nsolution. The role of the spectators is to ensure the conformal regime (see below).\nAs was mentioned, we will deal with the gauge symmetry breaking pattern of a\nhierarchical type. First, at a large scale \u223c m \u226b \u039bSU(3) the gauge group SU(3) is\nbroken down to a subgroup SU(2)\u00d7U(1) by the vacuum expectation values (VEV's)\nof the adjoint scalars.1 (Here \u039bSU(3) is the dynamical scale parameter of SU(3)).\n\u221a\nSecond, at a lower scale \u223c \u03bc mA , in the presence of the adjoint mass term \u03bc Tr\u03a62 ,\nthe light squark fields acquire VEV's of the color-flavor diagonal form (\"color-flavor\nlocking\"),\n\u221a\nk, A = 1, 2.\n(1.1)\nqkA = \u03b4Ak \u03bc m,\nIn each vacuum to be considered below, the squark fields of two (out of four) flavors\nwill be condensed, so that we can label each vacuum by a set of two numbers, (AB),\nshowing that the flavors A and B are condensed. For instance, we will speak of\n12-vacuum, 13-vacuum and so on.\nThe basic idea of the gauge field localization on the domain walls is that the\nquark fields (almost) vanish inside the wall. Therefore, the gauge group SU(2)\u00d7U(1),\nbeing Higgsed in the vacua to the right and to the left of the wall, is restored inside\nthe wall. Correspondingly, dual gauge bosons, being confined outside the wall are\nunconfined (or less confined), inside, thus leading to localization [2].\nIn fact, there is another scale in the problem which plays an important role in the\naforementioned hierarchy. In dealing with domain walls we cannot consider the limit\nin which all quark masses are exactly equal. In this limit the pairs of appropriate\nvacua coalesce, and we have no domain walls interpolating between them. Therefore,\nwe consider the limit of almost coinciding quark mass terms,\nm1 = m2 ,\n\nm3 = m4 ;\n\n\u2206m \u2261 m1 \u2212 m3 ;\n\n|\u2206m| \u226a m .\n\n(1.2)\n\nThe resulting hierarchy\n|\u2206m|, m \u226b \u039bSU(3) ,\n\u221a\n\u039bSU(2) \u226a \u03bcm \u226a |\u2206m| \u226a m\n\n(1.3)\n\nis exhibited in Fig. 1, together with the behavior of the corresponding gauge couplings.

This case essentially reduces to the problem which had been considered previously\n[2, 10, 4] - localization of the Abelian gauge fields on the wall. Here we are interested in localization\nof the non-Abelian gauge fields. Therefore, we we will deal with a special regime in which SU(3) \u2192\nSU(2) \u00d7 U(1). In Refs. [11, 12] (see also [13]) it was shown that some of N = 1 vacua of SU(N )\nN = 2 SQCD can preserve a non-Abelian subgroup.\n\n3\n\n\fgauge coupling\n1\u2212\n\nSU(2)\nU(1)\n|\n\n\u039bSU(2)\n\n|\n\n\u03bcm\n\n|\n\n\u2206m\n\nSU(3)\n|\n\nm\n\nscale\n\nFigure 1: The scale hierarchy: illustrating the fact that the gauge couplings never\nbecome large in the problem at hand. According to Eq. (2.6) \u03bc m = \u03be/6.\nNote that \u039bSU(2) is a would-be SU(2) dynamical scale.

However, the problem\nunder consideration is insensitive to this scale, as we will explain in detail in due\ncourse.\nThe theory at hand has domain walls of distinct types. Assume that in the\nvacuum to the left of the wall the squarks with the flavor indices 1 and 2 condense.\nIf in the vacuum to the right of the wall the condensed squarks are 1 and 3, we will\ncall such a wall elementary. If, on the other hand, the condensed squarks to the\nright of the wall are 3 and 4, this wall is obviously composite - it \"consists\" of two\nelementary walls, 12 \u2192 13 and 13 \u2192 34, see Fig. 2.\nThe domain wall which localizes SU(2) gauge fields is not elementary. It is a\nbound state of two elementary domain walls placed at one and the same position.\nThis is in accordance with the string/brane picture in which SU(2) gauge theory is\nlocalized on the world volume of a stack of two coinciding D-branes. If, however,\nthe two D-branes are separated, then in string theory the SU(2) gauge group is\nbroken to U(1)2 , while the masses of the \"charged\" W bosons are linear in the\nbrane separations. We will recover this picture in our field-theoretical set up.\nThe first stage of the spontaneous symmetry breaking, SU(3) \u2192 SU(2) \u00d7 U(1), is\nwell studied in the literature, and presents no interest for our purposes. Therefore,\nour dynamical analysis will start in essence from the SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) model. If one\nwishes, one can keep in mind that this latter model is originally embedded in SU(3)\nN = 2 SQCD, the \"prototheory,\" but this is not crucial.\nNext, we turn to the analysis of recently proposed non-Abelian strings (flux\ntubes) which carry orientational moduli corresponding to rotations of the \"colormagnetic\" flux direction inside a global SU(2)[6] (similar results in three dimensions\nwere obtained in Ref. [5]) .2 We find a 1/4-BPS solutions for the non-Abelian string\n2\n\nA very fresh publication [14], which appeared after the completion of the present paper, also\n\n4\n\n\fq\nq\n\n1\n\n=0\n/\n\nq\n\n2\n\n=0\n/\n\nq\n\n1\n\n=0\n/\n\nq\n\n3\n\n=0\n/\n\nq\n\n4\n3\n\n=0\n/\n=0\n/\n\nelementary\nwalls\n\nFigure 2: Two elementary walls which comprise a composite 12 \u2192 34 wall.\nending on the composite domain wall. The end point of the string is shown to play\nthe role of a non-Abelian charge in the effective world volume theory of non-Abelian\n(2+1)-dimensional gauge fields confined to the wall.\n\n2\n\nTheoretical set-up: SU(2)\u00d7 U(1) N = 2 SQCD\n\nIn this section we will describe the model we will work with (a descendant of SU(3)\nSeiberg-Witten model with four matter hypermultiplets) and appropriate pairs of\nvacua which are connected by elementary and composite walls.\n\n2.1\n\nThe model\n\nAs was mentioned in Sect. 1, the model we will deal with derives from N = 2 SQCD\nwith the gauge group SU(3) and four flavors of the quark hypermultiplets. At a\ngeneric point on the Coulomb branch of this theory, the gauge group is broken\ndown to U(1)\u00d7U(1). We will be interested, however, in a particular subspace of the\nCoulomb branch, on which the gauge group is broken down to SU(2)\u00d7U(1). We\nwill enforce 3 this regime by a special choice of the quark mass terms, see Eq. (1.2).\nThe breaking SU(3)\u2192SU(2)\u00d7U(1) occurs at the scale m which is supposed to\nlie very high, m \u226b \u039bSU(3) . Correspondingly, the masses of the gauge bosons from\nSU(3)/SU(2)\u00d7U(1) and their superpartners, proportional to m, are very large, and\nso are the masses of the third color component of the matter fields in the fundamental representation. We will be interested in phenomena at the scales \u226a m.\nTherefore, our starting point is in fact the SU(2)\u00d7U(1) model with four matter fields\nin the doublet representation of SU(2), as it emerges after the SU(3)\u2192SU(2)\u00d7U(1)\nbreaking. These matter fields are also coupled to the U(1) gauge field.\nexamines strings and their relation to monopoles.\n3\nIn certain vacua to be considered in this paper the gauge group is further broken to U(1)\u00d7U(1)\nat a much lower scale |\u2206m|, see Sect. 2.2.\n\n5\n\n\fThe field content of SU(2)\u00d7U(1) N = 2 SQCD with four flavors is as follows.\nThe N = 2 vector multiplet consists of the U(1) gauge fields A\u03bc and SU(2) gauge\n2a\nfield Aa\u03bc , (here a = 1, 2, 3), their Weyl fermion superpartners (\u03bb1\u03b1 , \u03bb2\u03b1 ) and (\u03bb1a\n\u03b1 , \u03bb\u03b1 ),\na\nand complex scalar fields a, and a , the latter in the adjoint of SU(2). The spinorial\nindex of \u03bb's runs over \u03b1 = 1, 2. In this sector the global SU(2)R symmetry inherent\nto the model at hand manifests itself through rotations \u03bb1 \u2194 \u03bb2 .\nThe quark multiplets of SU(2)\u00d7U(1) theory consist of the complex scalar fields\nkA\nq and q\u0303Ak (squarks) and the Weyl fermions \u03c8 kA and \u03c8\u0303Ak , all in the fundamental\nrepresentation of SU(2) gauge group. Here k = 1, 2 is the color index while A is the\nkA\nflavor index, A = 1, 2, 3, 4. Note that the scalars q kA and  \u0304q\u0303 \u2261 q\u0303Ak form a doublet\nunder the action of the global SU(2)R group.\nThe original SU(3) theory was perturbed by adding a small mass term for the\nadjoint matter, via the superpotential W = \u03bcTr\u03a62 . Generally speaking, this superpotential breaks N = 2 down to N = 1. The Coulomb branch shrinks to a\nnumber of isolated N = 1 vacua [11, 12]. In the limit of \u03bc \u2192 0 these vacua\ncorrespond to special singular points on the Coulomb branch in which pair of\nmonopoles/dyons or quarks become massless. The first three of these points (often referred to as the Seiberg-Witten vacua) are always at strong coupling. They\ncorrespond to N = 1 vacua of pure SU(3) gauge theory.\nThe massless quark points - they present vacua of a distinct type, to be referred\nto as the quark vacua - may or may not be at weak coupling depending on the\nvalues of the quark mass parameters mA . If mA \u226b \u039bSU(3) , the quark vacua do lie at\nweak coupling. Below we will be interested only in the quark vacua assuming that\nthe condition mA \u226b \u039bSU(3) is met.\nIn the low-energy SU(2)\u00d7U(1) theory, which is our starting point, the perturbation W = \u03bcTr\u03a62 can be truncated, leading to a crucial simplification. Indeed, since\nthe A chiral superfield, the N = 2 superpartner of the U(1) gauge field,4\n\u221a\nA \u2261 a + 2\u03bb2 \u03b8 + Fa \u03b82 ,\n(2.1)\nit not charged under the gauge group SU(2)\u00d7U(1), one can introduce the superpotential linear in A,\n1\nWA = \u2212 \u221a \u03be A .\n(2.2)\n2\nIt is rather obvious that WA is indeed a linear truncation of W = \u03bcTr\u03a62 . A\nremarkable feature of the superpotential (2.2) is that it does not break N = 2 supersymmetry [15, 16]. Keeping higher order terms in \u03bcTr\u03a62 would inevitably explicitly\nbreak N = 2 . For our purposes it is crucial that the model we will deal with is\nexactly N = 2 supersymmetric.\n4\n\nThe superscript 2 in Eq. (2.1) is the global SU(2)R index of \u03bb rather than \u03bb squared.\n\n6\n\n\fThe bosonic part of our SU(2)\u00d7U(1) theory has the form 5 [6]\nZ\n\nS =\n\n4\n\ndx\n\n\u2207\u03bc q\n\n+\n\n\"\n\n1 \u0010 a \u00112\n1\n1\n1\nF\u03bc\u03bd + 2 (F\u03bc\u03bd )2 + 2 |D\u03bc aa |2 + 2 |\u2202\u03bc a|2\n2\n4g2\n4g1\ng2\ng1\n\nA 2\n\n\u0015\n\n2\n\nA\n+ \u2207\u03bc  \u0304q\u0303\n+ V (q A , q\u0303A , aa , a) .\n\n(2.3)\n\nHere D\u03bc is the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation of SU(2), while\n\u2207\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212\n\na\ni\na \u03c4\nA\u03bc \u2212 iA\u03bc ,\n2\n2\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere we suppress the color SU(2) indices, and \u03c4 a are the SU(2) Pauli matrices.

Hence, g22 is given by its\nvalue at the scale m,\nm\n8\u03c0 2\n= 2 ln\n+ ***.\n(2.7)\n2\ng2\n\u039bSU(3)\nAt large m the SU(2) sector is indeed weakly coupled.\nThe U(1) coupling undergoes an additional renormalization from scale m down\nto the scale determined by the masses\n\u221a of light states in the low-energy theory (the\n\u221a\nlatter are of the order of \u03bcm \u223c \u03be, see Sect. 2.2). At the scale m the both\ncouplings, g22 and g12 unify since at this scale they belong to SU(3). Note that in\npassing from the SU(3) theory to SU(2)\u00d7U(1) we changed the normalization of the\neighth generator of SU(3) which became the generator of U(1), see Eq. (2.4). This\nchange of normalization implies that the unification condition takes the form\n8\u03c0 2\n8\u03c0 2\n=3 2\n.\ng12(m)\ng2 (m)\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe one-loop coefficient of the \u03b2 function for the U(1) theory is \u03b20 = 2 \u00d7 2 n2e Nf\nwhere the first factor of 2 reflects the difference in normalizations of the SU(N)\nversus U(1) generators, the extra factor of two comes from the fact that for each\nflavor we deal with matter doublets, and, finally, the electric charge ne = 1/2, see\n\u221a\nEq.

Besides the gauge symmetries, of importance are the\nglobal symmetries of the model. Our \"proto-SU(3)-model\" (mentioned in passing)\nhad SU(3)c broken down to SU(2)\u00d7U(1). This breaking occurs at at the scale m.\nThe resulting superpotential\n4 \u0010\n\u0011\n1 X\nW = \u221a\nq\u0303A Aq A + q\u0303A Aa \u03c4 a q A\n2 A=1\n\n+ m1\n\nX\n\nq\u0303A q A + m3\n\nA=1,2\n\nX\n\nq\u0303A q A\n\nA=3,4\n\n1\n\u2212 \u221a \u03beA,\n2\n\n(2.10)\n\nhas, in addition, a large global SU(2)f12 \u00d7 SU(2)f34 \u00d7U(1) flavor symmetry. At the\nscale \u2206m the color SU(2) may or may not be broken. In the 13, 14, 23, and 24 vacua\nit is broken by the vacuum expectation value of a3 down to U(1), paving the way\nto monopoles with typical sizes \u223c (\u2206m)\u22121 . In the 12 and 34 vacua ha3 i does not\ndevelop, and we can descend further, down the the scale \u03be. At this scale all gauge\nsymmetries, in all six vacua under consideration, are fully Higgsed. The AbrikosovNielsen-Olesen (ANO, Ref. [18]) strings are supported. The transverse size of these\nstrings, \u223c \u03be \u22121/2 , is much larger than (\u2206m)\u22121 . In fact, we will deal with two distinct\ntypes of strings which generalize their more primitive ANO counterparts. They\ncorrespond (in the quasiclassical limit) to distinct types of winding, see Sect. 5 for\nfurther details.\n\n2.2\n\nThe vacuum structure and excitation spectrum\n\nThis section briefly outlines the vacuum structure and the excitation mass spectrum\nof our basic SU(2)\u00d7U(1) model (for further details, including those referring to the\nfull SU(3) theory, see Refs. [11, 12, 13, 6]). First, we will examine relevant vacua.\n9\n\n\fI3\n\nelementary wall\ncomposite wall\n(12)\n\n(34)\n0\n\n|\nm3\n\nI\n\n|\n\n|\n\nm\n\nm1\n\n_ \u2206m\n(13) (14)\n(23) (24)\n\nFigure 3: The vacuum structure on the (I , I3 ) plane.\nThe vacua of the theory (2.3) are determined by the zeros of the potential (2.5).\nWe will assume the conditions (1.3) to be met. Then, besides three strong-coupling\nvacua which exist in pure SU(3) N = 2 Yang-Mills theory, we have eight vacua\nin which one quark flavor is condensed, and six vacua in which two quark flavors\ndevelop non-vanishing VEV's. For our problem - domain walls and flux tubes at\nweak coupling - we will choose these latter six vacua. They are 12-, 34-, 13-, 14-,\n23- and 24-vacua. In the first two SU(2) gauge symmetry is unbroken by adjoint\nscalars while in the last four vacua it is broken by them at the scale \u2206m.\nEach of the above six vacua (AB) is labeled by a triplet of gauge-invariant order\nparameters I1 , I and I3 defined as\nhq\u0303A q B i \u2261 I1 \u03b4AB ,\n\u221a\nhq\u0303A a q B i \u2261 \u2212 2 I \u00d7 I1 \u03b4AB ,\n1\nhq\u0303A aa \u03c4a q B i \u2261 \u221a I3 \u00d7 I1 (\u03c43 )B\nA,\n2\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere summation over the SU(2) color indices is implied. The corresponding vacuum\nstructure is exhibited in Fig. 3.\n2.2.1\n\nSU(2) symmetric vacua\n\nLet us first consider the 12 (or 34) vacuum. The adjoint fields develop the following\nVEV's:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(2.12)\nha3 i = 0,\nhai = \u2212 2 m1 = \u2212 2 m + O(\u2206m) ,\nwhere m is defined in Eq. (1.4). If the values of the mass parameters m1,3 and \u03bc are\nreal, we can exploit the freedom of rotations in SU(2) and U(1) to make the quark\nVEV's real too. Then in the case at hand they take the color-flavor locked form\nkA\n\n \u0304kA\n\nhq i = hq\u0303 i =\n10\n\ns\n\n\u03be\n2\n\n1 0\n0 1\n\n!\n\n,\n\n\fk = 1, 2,\n\nA = 1, 2 .\n\n(2.13)\n\nThis particular form of the squark condensates is dictated by the third line in\nEq. (2.5). Note that the squark fields stabilize at non-vanishing values entirely\ndue to the U(1) factor - the second term in the third line.\nThe gauge invariants corresponding to the vacuum (2.13) are\nI1 =\n\n\u03be\n,\n2\n\nI = m1 ,\n\nI3 = 0 .\n\n(2.14)\n\nAt first site it might seem that, say, the field configuration\nkA\n\n \u0304kA\n\nhq i = hq\u0303 i =\nk = 1, 2,\n\ns\n\n\u03be\n2\n\n0 1\n1 0\n\nA = 1, 2 ,\n\n!\n\n,\n(2.15)\n\nwhich also provides a (12)-vacuum solution, presents another vacuum. This is obviously not the case, since it is nothing but a gauge copy of Eq. (2.13). The gauge\ninvariants obtained from Eq. (2.15) are the same as in Eq. (2.14).\nLet us move on to the issue of the excitation spectrum in this vacuum. The mass\nmatrix for the gauge fields (Aa\u03bc , A\u03bc ) can be read off from the quark kinetic terms in\nEq. (2.3) and has the form\n!\ng22 0\n2\nMV = \u03be\n(2.16)\n0 g12\nThus, all three SU(2) gauge bosons become massive, with one and the same mass\nM1,2,3 = g2\n\nq\n\n(2.17)\n\nq\n\n(2.18)\n\n\u03be.\n\nThe equality of the masses is no accident. The point is that our model actually has\nthe symmetry SU(2)c \u00d7SU(2)f1,2 \u00d7SU(2)f3,4 where the first flavor SU(2) corresponds\nto rotations of the A = 1, 2 flavors, while the second flavor SU(2) to rotations\nof the A = 3, 4 flavors. The pattern of the spontaneous breaking is such that\nthe diagonal SU(2) from the product SU(2)c \u00d7SU(2)f1,2 remains an unbroken global\nSU(2) symmetry of the theory. Sure enough, SU(2)f3,4 is also unbroken, since the\nA = 3, 4 flavors play a passive role of spectators in the 12-vacuum.\nThe mass of the U(1) gauge boson is\nMU(1) = g1\n\n\u03be.\n\nFrom the mass scale m down to the scale |\u2206m| the gauge coupling g22 does not run\nbecause of conformality. Below |\u2206m|, the conformality is broken: two quark flavors\n2\nout of four have mass of the order of \u2206m and, hence, decouple. Therefore,\n\u221a g2 runs,\ngenerating a dynamical mass scale (1.5). At the mass scale M1,2,3 = g2 \u03be this last\nrunning gets frozen. Since M1,2,3 \u226b \u039bSU(2) , by assumption, the running of g22 in the\n11\n\n\f\u221a\ninterval from |\u2206m| down to \u03be can be neglected. Therefore, we can treat g22 in the\nabove relations as a scale independent constant (coinciding with the gauge constant\nnormalized at m). The mass spectrum of the adjoint scalar excitations is the same\nas for the gauge bosons. This is enforced by N = 2 .\nWhat is the mass spectrum of the quark (squark) excitations? These fields\nare color doublets. To ease the notation it will be convenient (sometimes) to use\nsubscripts r and b (red and blue) for the color indices of q and q\u0303. It is rather obvious\n(A=2)\nr\nb\nthat qr(A=1) , qb\n, q\u0303(A=1)\nand q\u0303(A=2)\nare \"eaten up\" in the Higgs mechanism. The\n(A=1)\n\nr\nb\nremaining four superfields, qr(A=2) , qb\n, q\u0303(A=2)\nand q\u0303(A=1)\nsplit into two groups -\na singlet under the residual global SU(2) with the mass (2.18), and a triplet under\nthe residual global SU(2) with the mass (2.17). Altogether we have 1+3 =4 long\nmassive N = 2 supermultiplets with mass squared proportional to \u03be.\nAs for the spectator quark flavors (those that do not condense in the given\nvacuum), the quarks/squarks of the third and fourth flavors are much heavier. They\nhave masses \u223c |\u2206m|, as is clear from Eq. (2.5). Assuming the limit (1.2), we include\nthe spectator quarks/squarks in the low-energy theory (2.3). In particular, each\nspectator quark flavor with the mass term m3 - remember, we have two of those -\nproduces two N = 2 multiplets. The first one, with the mass |m3 \u2212 m1 | = |\u2206m|, is\nformed from the r-components of the spectator quark, while the second one, with the\nsame mass, is formed from its b-components. Thus, each supermultiplet contains four\nbosonic and four fermionic (real) degrees of freedom (short N = 2 supermultiplet).\nAltogether we have four such supermultiplets - two doublets of the global SU(2).\nThere are no massless excitations in this vacuum.\nThe 34-vacuum is similar. The only difference is that the value of the gauge\ninvariant I in the 34-vacuum is I = m3 .\n\n2.2.2\n\nSU(2) non-symmetric vacua\n\nAs an example of such vacuum we will consider the 13-vacuum. Now, in contradistinction with the previous case, both adjoint fields, ha3 i and hai, develop vacuum\nexpectation values, so that Eq. (2.12) must be replaced by\nha3 i = \u2212\n\nm1 \u2212 m3\n\u2206m\n\u221a\n\u2261\u2212\u221a ,\n2\n2\n\nhai = \u2212\n\n\u221a\nm1 + m3\n\u221a\n\u2261 \u2212 2m.\n2\n\n(2.19)\n\nThe above vacuum values of the adjoint scalars follow from examination of the last\ntwo lines in Eq. (2.5). The squark fields in the vacuum are similar to those in\nEq. (2.13), with the replacement of the second flavor by the third one, namely,\nkA\n\n \u0304kA\n\nhq i = hq\u0303 i =\n12\n\ns\n\n\u03be\n2\n\n1 0\n0 1\n\n!\n\n,\n\n\fk = 1, 2,\n\nA = 1, 3 ,\n\n(2.20)\n\nup to gauge copies. The gauge invariant order parameters are\nI1 =\n\n\u03be\n,\n2\n\nI = m,\n\nI3 = \u2212\u2206m ,\n\n(2.21)\n\nsee Fig. 3.\nNext, let us examine the excitation spectrum in this vacuum. In this vacuum\nthe gauge group of our model is fully Higgsed too - all four gauge bosons acquire\nmasses. No \"custodial\" global SU(2) survives, however. Correspondingly, the masses\nof the gauge bosons A\u03bc1\u00b1i2 on the one hand, and A3\u03bc on the other, split.\nMore concretely,\nM(A\u03bc1\u00b1i2 ) = M(a1\u00b1i2 ) = \u2206m \u226b \u03be ,\n\n(2.22)\n\nwhile the masses of A\u03bc and A3\u03bc (and the same for a and a3 ) are given by the same\nvalues as in the SU(2)-symmetric vacua,\nMU(1) = g1\n\nq\n\nM3 = g2\n\nq\n\n\u03be,\n\u03be.\n\n(2.23)\n\nThe mass matrix for the lightest quarks has the size 8 \u00d7 8, including four (real)\ncomponents of the qr1 quark and four components of the qb3 quark. It has two vanishing eigenvalues associated with two states \"eaten\" by the Higgs mechanism for\ntwo U(1) gauge factors, and two non-zero eigenvalues coinciding with masses (2.23).\nEach of these non-zero eigenvalues corresponds to three quark eigenvectors. Altogether we have two long N = 2 multiplets with masses (2.23), each one containing\neight bosonic and eight fermionic states.\nLet us remember that, in the limit m1 = m2 and m3 = m4 , the 13-vacuum\ncoalesce with three others, namely, the 14-, 23- and 24-vacua, see Fig. 3. This means\nthat we have massless multiplets in these vacua. In fact, the common position of\nthese vacua on the Coulomb branch is the root of a Higgs branch. This Higgs branch\nhas dimension eight, cf. [11, 13]. To see this observe, that in the (A, B) vacuum\nwith A = 1, 2 and B = 3, 4 we have 16 real quark scalar variables (qr1 , qr2 , qb3 and\nqb4 ) subject to two D-term conditions and four F -term conditions. Also we have\nto subtract two U(1) phases. Overall we have 16 \u2212 6 \u2212 2 = 8 which gives us the\ndimension of the Higgs branch. This dimension should be a multiple of four since\nthe Higgs branches are hyper-K\u00e4hler manifolds [9].\n\n3\n\nThe N = 2 central charges relevant to the problem\n\nThe model under consideration supports, in various limits, all three classes of topological defects that are under scrutiny in the current literature: domain walls, strings\n13\n\n\fand monopoles. Below we will explore BPS-saturated defects, with a special emphasis on various junctions. The domain walls and strings are 1/2 BPS, the wall-string\njunctions and the string-string junctions are 1/4 BPS.\nIt is instructive to begin from the discussion of corresponding central charges in\nN = 2 superalgebra. While a part of the material below is a mini-review, in the\nanalysis of the monopole central charge we will add a bifermion term which was\nroutinely omitted previously. It was omitted for a good reason, though: for a free\nmonopole the contribution of this bifermion term vanishes. It is crucial, however,\nfor the confined monopoles to which we will turn below.\n\n3.1\n\n(1, 0) and (0, 1) central charges\n\nThese central charges are saturated by domain walls. They appear in the anticommutators {Qf\u03b1 Qg\u03b2 } (remember, f, g = 1, 2 are SU(2)R indices). Since {Qf\u03b1 Qg\u03b2 } \u223c\nR\nd \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 where d \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 is the element of the area of the domain wall in question\n(d\u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 = d\u03a3\u03b2\u03b1 ), the (1/2,1/2) central charges must be symmetric with respect to\nthe interchange f \u2194 g. More precisely,\n{Qf\u03b1 Qg\u03b2 } = \u22124 \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 Z\u0304 f g ,\nwhere\n\n(3.1)\n\n1\n\u03a3\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\ndx[\u03bc dx\u03bd] (\u03c3 \u03bc )\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 (\u03c3\u0304 \u03bd )\u03b1\u0307\u03b2 \u223c Wall Area ,\n(3.2)\n2 wall\nwhile the central charge Z\u0304 f g ought to be an SU(2)R vector.\nIn the string-theory context the (1, 0) and (0, 1) central charges were first discussed in Ref. [19]. The discovery of the corresponding field-theoretic anomaly in supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theories [2] paved the way to multiple explorations\nand uses of the (1, 0) and (0, 1) central charges in field theory (e.g. [20, 21, 22] to\nname just a few).\nTwo observations severely constrain the form of the central charge Z\u0304 f g : first,\nit must be (anti)holomorphic in fields; second, it must be a SU(2)R vector. As a\nresult, the most general form compatible with the above observations is 6\nZ\n\nZ\n\nfg\n\n4\nc1 f g\nc2 af ag\n= \u2206 \u2212 \u221a \u03bef g A +\n\u03bb \u03bb +\n\u03bb \u03bb\n2\n16\u03c0\n16\u03c0 2\n2\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere \u2206 means the difference of the expectation values of the operator in parentheses\nin two vacua between which the wall in question interpolates. Furthermore, the\nparameter \u03be \u0304f g is an SU(2)R matrix (related to a real vector \u03be~ ) introduced in Ref. [16].\nIn the model under consideration \u03be f g = (\u03be/2) diag {1, \u22121}, see the remark after\nEq. (3.4).\n6\n\nDerivation of Eq. (3.3) also exploits the specific feature of N = 2 theories that each given\nsuperfield enters in the superpotential linearly, see Eq. (2.10). This implies, in particular, that in\nany given vacuum (at the classical level) W2 + W3 \u2261 0 where W2,3 are the quadratic and cubic\nparts of the superpotential.\n\n14\n\n\fThe last two terms in Eq. (3.3), containing numerical coefficients c1,2 , present\na quantum anomaly, a generalization of that of Ref. [2]. The coefficients c1,2 are\nreadily calculable in terms of the Casimir operators of the gauge group of the model\nunder consideration; they also depend on the matter content. We will not dwell on\nthem here because, given our hierarchy of parameters (1.3), the anomalous terms in\nZ f g will play no role. A rather straightforward algebra (in conjunction with known\nresults) yields us the coefficient in front of \u03be f g A quoted in Eq. (3.3). To this end\nwe combine Eq. (2.10) above with Eqs. (3.19) and (3.20) from Ref. [23]. In our\nnormalization the BPS wall tension reduces 7 e.g. to Tw = |Z 11 |.\n\n3.2\n\n(1/2, 1/2) central charge\n\nThis central charge is saturated by strings (flux tubes).8 It appears in the anticommutator {Qf\u03b1 Q\u0304\u03b2\u0307 g }. This central charge is not holomorphic, and has no particular\nsymmetry with respect to permutations of the SU(2)R indices f and g.\nIt is well-known that the (1/2, 1/2) central charge exists also in N = 1 supersymmetric QED (SQED) with the Fayet-Iliopoulos term, see Ref. [27] and especially\nRef. [28], specifically devoted to this issue. In Ref. [28] it is shown, in particular,\nthat if the spontaneous breaking of U(1) is due to the Fayet-Iliopoulos term [29],\nthen the corresponding ANO string is saturated in N = 1 , and the string tension\nis given by the value of the central charge. In Ref. [24] it was proven that at weak\ncoupling this is the only mechanism leading to BPS strings in N = 1 theories, which\nare, thus, by necessity, the ANO strings.9\nOur emphasis will be on \"non-Abelian,\" rather than ANO strings (the meaning\nof \"non-Abelian-ness\" is explained in Sect. 5). It is only the extended, N = 2 , supersymmetry that can make them BPS-saturated. Following Ref. [16], the (1/2,1/2)\nanticommutator in the N = 2 model at hand can be written as follows:\n{Qf\u03b1\n\nQ\u0304\u03b2\u0307 g } =\n\n2 \u03b4gf\n\n\u03bc\n\n(\u03c3 )\u03b1\u03b2\u0307 P\u03bc + 4i (\u03c3\n\n\u03bc\n\n)\u03b1\u03b2\u0307 \u03begf\n\nZ\n\nd3 x\n\n1\n\u03b50\u03bc\u03b4\u03b3 F\u03b4\u03b3 ,\n2\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere P\u03bc is energy-momentum operator while 10\n\u03begf = (\u03c4 m /2)fg \u03be m .\nMoreover, the vector \u03be m is a SU(2)R triplet of generalized Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters (in our model only \u03be 1 \u2261 \u03be is non-zero).\nThe second term in Eq. (3.4) is the (1/2, 1/2) central charge. It is worth emphasizing that it is only the U(1) field F\u03b4\u03b3 that enters; the SU(2) gauge field does\nnot contribute to this central charge for rather evident reasons. The central charge\nFor generic matrices Z f g it is the eigenvalue of Z f g that counts.\nIt is also instrumental in the issue of BPS-saturated vortices [21] and wall junctions [24, 25].\nOne can trace this line of reasoning to Ref. [26].\n9\nNote, however, that the (1/2,1/2) central charge is missing in the general analysis of Ref. [30].\n10\nNote that the definition of \u03begf in Ref. [16] differs by a factor of 2.\n7\n\n8\n\n15\n\n\fis obviously\nproportional to L, the length of the string, times the magnetic flux of\nR\n~ directed along the string axis. With the normalizations accepted\nthe string d2 xB\nthroughout this paper one can write for the BPS string tension\nTs =\n\nZ\n\n~ | \u03be~ | = 2\u03c0\u03be ,\nd2 xB\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere the last equality refers to the elementary strings. For the ANO string the flux\nis twice larger, so that TANO = 4\u03c0\u03be, see Sect. 5.\n\n3.3\n\nThe Lorentz-scalar central charge\n\nAs well-known [31], this central charge is possible only because of the extended\nnature of supersymmetry, N = 2 . It appears in the anticommutator {Qf\u03b1 Qg\u03b2 } and\nhas the structure\n(3.6)\n{Qf\u03b1 Qg\u03b2 } = \u03b5\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b5f g 2 Z ,\nwhere Z is an SU(2)R singlet while the factor of 2 on the right-hand side is a\ntraditional normalization. It is most convenient to write Z in terms of the topological\ncharge, an integral over the topological density,\nZ=\n\nZ\n\nd3 x \u03b6 0 (x) .\n\n(3.7)\n\nIn the model at hand\n\u03b6\u03bc =\n\n+\n\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\n\u03b5\n\u2202\u03bd\n2\n\ni\ni a a\na F\u03c1\u03c3 + 2 aF\u03c1\u03c3\n2\ng2\ng1\n\nc f \u03b1\u03b2 g\n2 c g22 A \u03b1\u03b2\n\u03bb\ns\n\u03bb\n\u03b5\n+\n\u03c8 s \u03c8\u0303A \u03b2\nf\ng\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n4\u03c0 2\n4\u03c0 2 \u03b1\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere s\u03b1\u03b2 is a symmetric matrix corresponding to the Lorentz representation (1,0)\nin the spinorial notation,\ns\u03b1\u03b2 = (\u03c3 [\u03c1 )\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 (\u03c3\u0304 \u03c3] )\u03b1\u0307\u03b2 ,\n(3.9)\nwhile the square brackets in the superscripts denote antisymmetrization with respect\nto \u03c1 and \u03c3. Moreover, c is a numerical coefficient.\nTwo comments are in order here. First, the first two terms in Eq. (3.8) present\nthe conventional \"monopole\" central charge which is routinely discussed in numerous\nreviews. It emerges from the canonic (anti)commutators at the tree level. In generic\nmodels it is in fact the (1,0) gauge field strength tensor which appears in these\nclassical terms in the first line in Eq. (3.8), i.e. the (anti)selfdual combination. In\nthe model at hand only the magnetic field survives in the expression for the central\ncharge; therefore, we dropped the electric component.\nThe last two (bifermion) terms in Eq. (3.8) are due to an anomaly, which is, in a\nsense, an N = 2 counter-partner to that of Ref. [2]. They will be discussed in more\n16\n\n\fdetail in the accompanying paper [32] where the value of the coefficient c will be\ndetermined. They were unknown previously playing no role in the routine monopole\nanalysis. They do play a crucial role, however, for the Higgs phase monopoles\n(confined monopoles), to be discussed in brief in Sect. 6. In fact, this anomaly must\nmatch the recently obtained anomalous central charge [33] in two-dimensional O(3)\nsigma model. More on that will be said in Sect. 6 and Ref. [32].\n\n4\n\nDomain walls\n\nIn this section we study BPS domain walls between various vacua described in\nSects. 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. First, we derive the first order equations for the BPS walls\nand, second, find and analyze their solutions. Our final goal is to work out the\nsolution for the composite wall 12 \u2192 34 on which we will eventually get localized\nnon-Abelian gauge fields.\n\n4.1\n\nFirst-order equations for elementary and composite walls\n\nLet us note that the structure of the vacuum condensates in all six vacua considered\nin Sects. 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 suggests that we can search for the domain wall solutions\nusing the ansatz\n1\nkA\nq kA =  \u0304q\u0303 \u2261 \u221a \u03c6kA ,\n(4.1)\n2\nwhere we introduce a new complex field \u03c6kA , k = r, b. Note that the above ansatz\nviolates holomorphy in the space of fields inherent to F terms: superpotentials\nand certain other expressions derivable from them. This is why some expressions\npresented below which should be holomorphic on general grounds, do not look holomorphic on the ansatz (4.1).\nWithin this ansatz the effective action (2.3) becomes\nS =\n\nZ\n\n4\n\ndx\n\n(\n\n1 \u0010 a \u00112\n1\n1\n1\nF\u03bc\u03bd + 2 (F\u03bc\u03bd )2 + 2 |D\u03bc aa |2 + 2 |\u2202\u03bc a|2\n2\n4g2\n4g1\ng2\ng1\n\n\u00112\n\u00112\ng2 \u0010\ng22 \u0010\n\u03c6\u0304A \u03c4 a \u03c6A + 1 |\u03c6A |2 \u2212 2\u03be\n8\n8\n\u001b\n\u221a\n2\n1 a a\n(a \u03c4 + a + 2mA )\u03c6A\n,\n2\n\n+ |\u2207\u03bc \u03c6A |2 +\n+\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere we use the same notation as in Eq. (2.4).\nFor the time being let us drop the gauge field in Eq. (4.2). It is irrelevant for the\n\"standard\" domain wall. If we assume that all fields depend only on the coordinate\n\n17\n\n\fz \u2261 x3 , the Bogomolny completion 11 of the wall energy functional can be written\nas\nTw =\n\nZ\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\n\u221a\n1\ndz \u2202z \u03c6 \u00b1 \u221a (aa \u03c4 a + a + 2mA )\u03c6A\n\uf8f3\n2\n\n2\n\nA\n\n2\n\n+\n\ng2\n1\n\u2202z aa \u00b1 \u221a (\u03c6\u0304A \u03c4 a \u03c6A )\ng2\n2 2\n\n+\n\n1\ng1\n\u2202z a \u00b1 \u221a (|\u03c6A |2 \u2212 2\u03be)\ng1\n2 2\n\n2\n\n\u00b1\n\n\u221a\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\n2\u03be\u2202z a .\n\n(4.3)\n\n\uf8fe\n\nIn the above expression we have omitted another full-derivative boundary term\nP\nproportional to (\u2202/\u2202z) Q(\u2202W/\u2202Q) where the sum runs over all superfields. Since\nin all vacua (\u2202W/\u2202Q) = 0, this term produces no impact whatsoever.\nPutting mod-squared terms to zero gives us the first-order Bogomolny equations,\nwhile the surface term (the last one in Eq. (4.3)) gives the wall tension. Assuming\nfor definiteness that \u2206m > 0 and choosing the upper sign in (4.3) we get the BPS\nequations,\n\u0011\n\u221a\n1 \u0010\n\u2202z \u03c6A = \u2212 \u221a aa \u03c4 a + a + 2mA \u03c6A ,\n2\n\u0011\ng2 \u0010\n\u2202z aa = \u2212 \u221a2 \u03c6\u0304A \u03c4 a \u03c6A ,\n2 2\n\u0011\ng2 \u0010\n\u2202z a = \u2212 \u221a1 |\u03c6A |2 \u2212 2\u03be .\n2 2\n\n(4.4)\n\nTensions of the walls satisfying the above equations are given by the surface term\nin Eq. (4.3).12 Say, for the elementary walls 12 \u2192 1B or 12 \u2192 B2, (B = 3, 4), this\ngives\nTw(12\u21921B) = Tw(12\u2192B2) = (\u2206m) \u03be ,\n(4.5)\nwhere we use the fact that\n\u2206a \u2261 (a)13 \u2212 (a)12 =\n\nm1 \u2212 m3\n\u2206m\n\u221a\n= \u221a .\n2\n2\n\nRemember, the elementary walls are those for which both vacua, initial and final,\nhave a common flavor. The wall 12 \u2192 34 can be considered as a bound state of two\n11\n\nThe Bogomolny completion is routinely used in such problems after its introduction in Ref. [34]\nand the subsequent identification of the central charges of various superalgebras with topological\ncharges [35].\n12\nIt is easy to check that the very same result follows from the central charge (3.3).\n\n18\n\n\felementary walls 12 \u2192 1B and 1B \u2192 CB, (C = 3, 4, B 6= C). For the composite\nwalls Eq. (4.3) implies\nTw(12\u219234) = 2 (\u2206m) \u03be ,\n(4.6)\nsince \u2206a is twice larger. We see that this wall has twice the tension of the elementary\nwalls. This means that the bound state is marginally stable; the elementary BPS\ncomponents forming the composite wall do not interact. Equations (4.5) and (4.6)\nand the subsequent statement are valid up to non-perturbative effects residing in\nthe anomalous terms in Eq. (3.3). For further discussion see Sect. 7.\n\n4.2\n\nElementary domain walls\n\nIt is time to explicitly work out the solution to the first-order equations (4.4) for the\ndomain wall interpolating between the vacua (12) and (1B) where B = 3 or 4. We\nassume that\nq\nq\nm \u226b \u2206m \u226b \u03be = 6\u03bc m .\n(4.7)\nThis condition allows us to find analytic domain wall solutions. In addition, it makes\ntransparent the physical reason for the gauge field localization on domain walls [4].\nAccepting (4.7) we guarantee, as will be shown shortly, that the quark fields (almost)\nvanish inside the composite (12 \u2192 34)-wall, to be treated in Sect. 4.3. The only\ngauge symmetry breaking surviving inside this wall is that induced by the VEV of\nthe SU(2) singlet adjoint field a.\nLet us choose the wall 12 \u2192 14 for definiteness. The boundary conditions for\nthe fields a3 and a are obviously as follows (cf. Sects. 2.2.1 and 2.2.2):\n\u221a\na3 (\u2212\u221e) = 0,\na(\u2212\u221e) = \u2212 2m1 ,\n\u221a\na(\u221e) = \u2212 2m .\n\n1\na3 (\u221e) = \u2212 \u221a \u2206m,\n2\n\n(4.8)\n\nWe see that the range of variation of the fields a3 and a inside the wall is of the\norder of \u2206m. Minimization of their kinetic energies implies then that these fields\nare slowly varying. Therefore, we may\n\u221a safely assume that the wall is thick on the\n\u22121/2\nscale of \u03be\n; the wall size R \u226b 1/ \u03be. This fact will be confirmed shortly, see also\nthe previous investigation [4].\n\u221a\nOn the contrary, the quark fields vary inside small regions of the order of 1/ \u03be\n- this scale is determined by the masses of the light quarks (2.23). In particular,\n\u03c62b varies from its VEV in the 12-vacuum, (see Eq. (2.13)),\nh\u03c62b i =\n\nq\n\n\u03be,\n\nat z = \u2212\u221e to zero near the the left edge of the wall (Fig. 4), whereas \u03c64b varies from\nzero to its VEV in the 14-vacuum,\n|h\u03c64b i| =\n19\n\nq\n\n\u03be,\n\n\fnear the right edge of the wall. The \u03c61r quark field does not vanish inside the wall\nbecause it has a non-zero VEV\nq\nh\u03c61r i = \u03be\n\nin both vacua, initial and final. It acquires a constant value \u03c61r0 inside the wall which\nwill be determined shortly.\nWith these values of the quark fields inside the wall, the last two equations in\n(4.4) tell us that the fields a3 and a are linear function of z (cf. Ref. [4]). The\nsolutions for a3 and a take the form\n\u221a\n\u2206m z \u2212 z0 \u2212 R/2\na = \u2212 2 m\u2212\n2\nR\n\n!\n\nz \u2212 z0 + R/2\n1\n,\na3 = \u2212 \u221a \u2206m\nR\n2\n\n,\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere the collective coordinate z0 is the position of the wall center, while R is the\nwall thickness (Fig. 4). It is worth remembering that \u2206m is assumed positive. The\nsolution (4.9) is valid in a wide domain of z,\n|z \u2212 z0 | <\n\nR\n,\n2\n\n(4.10)\n\n\u221a\nexcept narrow areas of size \u223c 1/ \u03be near the edges of the wall at z \u2212 z0 = \u00b1R/2.\nSubstituting the solution (4.9) into the last two equations in (4.4) we get\n!\n\n\u2206m\nR=\n\u03be\n\n1\n1\n+ 2 .\n2\ng1 g2\n\n(4.11)\n\nAt the same time, the solution for r-quark inside the wall is\n\u03c61r = \u03c61r0 =\n\nv\nu\nu\nt\n\n2\u03be\ng22\n\n\u0010\n\n1\ng12\n\n+\n\n1\ng22\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2248\n\ns\n\n\u03be\n.\n2\n\n(4.12)\n\nWe see that the r-quark field inside the wall differs from its value in the bulk,\ngenerally speaking. Only if we take g1 = g2 (which is not what\n\u221a comes out from\n1\nthe SU(3) \"protomodel,\"\nsee Eq. (2.8)) \u03c6r0 becomes equal to \u221a\n\u03be, its value in the\n\u221a\nbulk. Since \u2206m/ \u03be \u226b 1, the result (4.11) shows that R \u226b 1/ \u03be, justifying our\napproximation.\nAs a test of the validity of the solution above, let us verify that the solution\n1\n\u03c6r =const satisfies the first of equations (4.4) inside the wall. Substituting solutions\n(4.9) for the a fields in this equation we get \u2202z \u03c6r = 0, in full accord with our solution\n(4.12). Furthermore, we can now use the first relation in Eq. (4.4) to determine the\ntails of the b-components of the 2,4-squark fields inside the wall.\n\n20\n\n\fTo this end, consider first the left edge (the domain E1 in Fig. 4) at z\u2212z0 = \u2212R/2.\nSubstituting the above solution for a's in the equation for \u03c62b we arrive at\n\u03c62b =\n\nR 2\n\n\u03be e\u2212 2R (z\u2212z0 + 2 ) .\n\nq\n\n\u2206m\n\n(4.13)\n\n\u221a\nThis behavior is valid in the domain M, at (z \u2212 z0 + R/2) \u226b 1/ \u03be, and shows that\nthe field of the second quark flavor tends to zero exponentially inside the wall, as\nwas expected.\n\n\u03c6 2b\n\n....\n\n\u03c6b\n\n4\n\nE1\n\nM\n\nE2\n\n. . . .. 1\n. .\n.\n\u03c6r\n. . ...... .\nz0\n\nz\na3\na\n\n\u03be\u22121/2\n\n\u03be\n\n\u22121/2\n\nFigure 4: Internal structure of the 12 \u2192 14 domain wall: two edges (domains E1,2 )\nof the width \u223c \u03be \u22121/2 are separated by a broad middle band (domain M) of the width\nR, see Eq. (4.11).\nBy the same token, we can consider the behavior of b-components of the fourth\nflavor squark field near the right edge of the wall at z \u2212 z0 = R/2.

Inside the wall the fourth quark fields tend to zero exponentially too.\nIn the domains near the wall edges,\nz \u2212 z0 = \u00b1R/2 ,\n21\n\n\fe\n2\n\ne\n1\n\nb\n\nr\n\n1/2\n\n1\n\nFigure 5: Root and weight vectors of the SU(3) algebra.\n3\nthe fields \u03c6A\nr,b as well as a and a smoothly interpolate between their VEV's in the\ngiven vacua and the inside-the-wall behavior determined by Eqs. (4.9), (4.13), and\n(4.14). It is not difficult to check that these domains produce contributions to the\nwall tension of the order of \u03be 3/2 , which makes them negligible.\nA comment is in order here regarding the collective coordinates characterizing\nthe elementary domain wall. We have two collective coordinates in our wall solution:\nthe position of the center z0 and the phase \u03c3. In the effective low-energy theory on\nthe wall world volume they become (pseudo)scalar fields of the world volume (2+1)dimensional theory, \u03b6(t, x, y) and \u03c3(t, x, y), respectively. The target space of the\nsecond field is S1 , as is obvious from Eqs. (4.14).\nIn (2+1)-dimensional theory on the wall the compact (pseudo)scalar is equivalent\nto a U(1) gauge field via the relation [36]\n(2+1)\nFnm\n= const \u00d7 \u03b5nmk \u2202 k \u03c3 ,\n\n(4.15)\n\nwhere n, m, k = 1, 2, 3.\nWe see that our elementary domain wall localizes the U(1) gauge field on its\nworld volume, as was expected, and in full accord with the string/D-brane notions.\nThe physical reason for this localization was first suggested in [2] and then elaborated in detail in [4] for the case of N = 2 QCD with the SU(2) gauge group (a\nmodel effectively reducible to SQED). In this particular aspect - the gauge field\nlocalization on the elementary wall - the present SU(2)\u00d7U(1) model has slight\ndistinctions compared to that of Ref. [4] that are worth mentioning.\nIn the bulk the gauge symmetry is broken down to U(1)2 by the VEV of the a3\nadjoint field, and then, at a much lower scale, it is completely broken by the squark\ncondensation. At the same time, inside the wall the only non-vanishing squark field\nis the r-component of the first quark flavor. Therefore, inside the wall the U(1)\nfactor orthogonal to the r-th weight vector of the gauge group SU(3) is restored.\nThis U(1) factor is associated with e2 -root of the gauge group, see Fig. 5 where we\nimagine an embedding of the SU(2)\u00d7U(1) gauge group in the SU(3) gauge group of\nour underlying \"protomodel.\" Thus we have a localization of the e2 gauge field on\n12 \u2192 14 wall.\nNote that this field is dual to the one present in the bulk [2, 10, 4]. This means\n22\n\n\fthat if we put the e2 -monopole at a certain point in the bulk, the e2 -string will be\nattached to this monopole because monopoles are in the confining phase in the quark\nvacua (see [13] and a brief review in Sect. 5 below on the flux tubes in SU(2)\u00d7U(1)\nN = 2 QCD). As we will see in Sect. 5, it is this string that will end on our\nelementary walls, the string endpoint playing the role of a (dual) electric charge for\nthe (2+1)-dimensional U(1) gauge field (4.15) living on the wall world volume.\nIn conclusion of this section it is worth noting that the scalar \u03b6(xn ) and the\ngauge field Am (xn ) form the bosonic part of N = 2 vector supermultiplet in 2+1\ndimensions.\n\n4.3\n\nComposite walls (12 \u2192 34) (bound states of the type\n(12 \u2192 14) + (14 \u2192 34)\n\nIn this section we will consider the composite domain wall interpolating between the\nvacua 12 and 34.\nThe boundary conditions for all fields at z = \u2212\u221e are given by their VEV's in\nthe 12-vacuum\na3 (\u2212\u221e) = 0 ,\n\u221a\na(\u2212\u221e) = \u2212 2 m1 ,\n\u03c61r (\u2212\u221e) = \u03c62b (\u2212\u221e) =\n\nq\n\n\u03be,\n\n\u03c63r (\u2212\u221e) = \u03c64b (\u2212\u221e) = 0 ,\n\n(4.16)\n\nwhile at z = \u221e they are given by VEV's in the 34-vacuum,\na3 (\u221e) = 0 ,\n\u221a\na(\u221e) = \u2212 2 m3 ,\n\u03c61r (\u221e) = \u03c62b (\u221e) = 0 ,\n\u03c63r (\u221e) = \u03c64b (\u221e) =\n\nq\n\n\u03be.\n\n(4.17)\n\nNow all quark fields (nearly) vanish inside the wall. The solution for the a fields in\nthe middle domain M (Fig. 4) is given by\n\u221a\nz \u2212 z0 + R\u0303/2\na = \u2212 2 m1 \u2212 \u2206m\n,\nR\u0303\n!\n\na3 = 0 ,\n\n(4.18)\n\nwhere we\n\u221a introduce the thickness R\u0303 of the composite wall, to be considered large,\nR\u0303 \u226b 1/ \u03be, see below. The equation for a3 in (4.4) is trivially satisfied, while the\n23\n\n\fequation for a yields\n\n2\u2206m\n,\n(4.19)\ng12 \u03be\n\u221a\ndemonstrating that indeed that R\u0303 \u226b 1/ \u03be. Note, that for a particular (unrealistic)\ncase g1 = g2 (which we do not consider, since, according to Eq. (2.8), g1 6= g2 ) the\nsize of the composite wall is equal to that of the elementary ones, see (4.11).\nSubstituting the above solutions in the first two equations in (4.4) we determine\nthe fall-off of the quark fields inside the wall. Namely, near the left edge\nR\u0303 =\n\n\u03c61r\n\u03c62b\n\n\u03c6\n\n=\n\n\u00112\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00112\n\n,\n\n=\n\n\u2212 \u2206m z\u2212z0 + R\u0303\n2\n\n=\n\nq\n\n\u2212 \u2206m z\u2212z0 + R\u0303\n2\n\nwhile near the right one\nkB\n\n\u0010\n\nq\n\n\u03bee\n\n2R\u0303\n\n\u03bee\n\n2R\u0303\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2206m\nR\u0303\nkB \u2212 2R\u0303 z\u2212z0 + 2\n\nq\n\n\u03be (\u0168) e\n\n\u00112\n\n,\n\n(4.20)\n\nB = 3, 4 ,\n\n(4.21)\n\nwhere the matrix \u0168 is a matrix from the U(2) global flavor group, which takes into\naccount possible flavor rotations inside the flavor pair B = 3, 4. It can be represented\nas product of a U(1) a phase factor and a matrix U from SU(2)\n\u0168 = ei\u03c30 U\n\n(4.22)\n\nThis matrix is parametrized by four phases, \u03c30 plus three phases residing in the\nmatrix U.\nThe occurrence of these four wall moduli - one related to U(1) and three to\nSU(2) - can be illustrated by the argument which runs parallel to that outlined in\nRef. [4]. Indeed, in both vacua, 12 or 34, taken separately, one can always use the\nsymmetries of the theory to render the vacuum matrix {\u03c6kA } diagonal,\nkA\n\n{\u03c6 }vac =\n\nq\n\n\u03be\n\n1 0\n0 1\n\n!\n\n,\n\nA = 1, 2 or A = 3, 4 ,\n\n(4.23)\n\n\u221a\nwith the real parameter \u03be in front. When both 12- and 34-vacua get involved -\nas is the case in the problem of the composite wall - a necessity arises of taking\ninto account their relative alignment. The most concise way to see how these moduli\nemerge is through examination of a (non-local) gauge-invariant order parameter 13\nOAB (t, x, y)\n\n*\n( Z\n\u0012 a\nL\n1\n\u03c4 a\n\u2261\n\u03c6\u0304A (t, x, y | z = \u2212L) exp i\ndz\nA (t, x, y | z)\n\u03be\n2 3\n\u2212L\n\n+\n13\n\n1\nA3 (t, x, y | z)\n2\n\n\u0013\u001b\n\nB\n\n\u001d\n\n\u03c6 (t, x, y | z = L) ,\n\n(4.24)\n\nThe definition below is restricted to the ansatz (4.1). In defining the non-local gauge invariant\norder parameter relevant to the domain walls this is by no means necessary. The general definition\nis similar to that in Eq. (4.24) with the replacement \u03c6\u0304 \u2192 q\u0303.\n\n24\n\n\fwhere\nA = 1, 2;\n\nB = 3, 4\n\nand L is a large parameter which we are supposed to take to infinity at the very end\n(in practice, L \u226b R\u0303.)\nThe order parameter OAB is non-singlet with respect to the global U(2) inherent\nto our model upon its complete Higgsing. In both vacua, 12 and 34, the order\nparameter OAB equals to unit matrix - this is quite evident. However, is not trivial\non the 12 \u2192 34 wall. On the wall OAB (t, x, y) reduces to a constant U(2) matrix\n(independent of t, x, y) of the form\nOAB = \u0168AB .\n\n(4.25)\n\nApplying all available symmetries of the model at hand, the best we can do is to\nreduce the number of parameters residing in OAB to four: one U(1) phase and three\nparameters of global SU(2). There are no massless moduli in both vacua, initial and\nfinal; thus all of these four parameters are collective coordinates of the wall.\nBelow we will identify these four moduli with (2+1)-dimensional gauge fields\nliving on the wall world volume via duality relations of the type presented in (4.15).\nThus, we get four gauge fields localized on the wall. The physical interpretation\nof this result is as follows. The quark fields are condensed outside the 12 \u2192 34 wall\nwhile inside they vanish. This means that dual gauge fields are severely confined\noutside the wall while inside the confinement becomes inoperative. This is precisely\nthe mechanism of the gauge field localization suggested in Ref. [2].\n\n4.4\n\nEffective field theory on the wall\n\nIn this section we work out the (2+1)-dimensional low-energy theory of the moduli on\nthe wall. First we will discuss the elementary walls and then focus on the composite\nwall 12 \u2192 34.\n4.4.1\n\nElementary walls\n\nIn this section we will deal with the elementary domain walls 1, 2 \u2192 1, B with B = 3\nor 4. Our task is to work out the effective (2+1)-dimensional theory for the wall\ncollective coordinates (which become the world-volume fields). For the elementary\nwalls the overall situation is quite similar to that discussed in our previous work [4].\nTherefore, we will be rather fragmentary.\nAs was elucidated in Sect. 4.2, the elementary wall has two bosonic collective\ncoordinates, z0 and \u03c3, plus their fermionic counterparts \u03b7 \u03b1f . We make slowly varying\nfields dependent on t, x, y \u2261 xn (n = 0, 1, 2),\nz0 \u2192 \u03b6(xn ) ,\n\n\u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3(xn ) ,\n\n25\n\n\u03b7 \u03b1f \u2192 \u03b7 \u03b1f (xn ) .\n\n(4.26)\n\n\fWe can limit ourselves to the bosonic fields \u03b6(xn ) and \u03c3(xn ) - the residual supersymmetry will allow us to readily reconstruct the fermion part of the effective\naction.\nThe fields \u03b6(xn ) and \u03c3(xn ) are in one-to-one correspondence with the zero modes\nin the wall background; therefore, they have no potential terms in the world sheet\ntheory, only kinetic. Our immediate task is to derive these kinetic terms essentially\nrepeating the procedure of Ref. [4]. For \u03b6(xn ) this is trivial. Substituting the\nwall solution (4.9), (4.13), and (4.14) in the action (4.2) and accounting for the xn\ndependence of \u03b6(xn ), with no further delay we arrive at\nTw\n2\n\nZ\n\nd3 x (\u2202n \u03b6)2 .\n\n(4.27)\n\nThis answer is quite general and would be valid for the translational modulus in any\nmodel.\nAs far as the kinetic term for \u03c3(xn ) is concerned an additional (albeit modest)\neffort is needed. We start from Eq. (4.14) for the quark fields on the right edge\nof the wall which depend on the phase \u03c3 parametrizing a relative phase orientation\nof the fourth flavor with regards to the second one. To calculate the corresponding\nkinetic term we have to modify our ansatz for the gauge fields, namely,\nA3n = \u2212\u03c73 (z) \u2202n \u03c3(xn ) ,\nAn = \u03c70 (z) \u2202n \u03c3(xn ) .\n\n(4.28)\n\nWe introduce extra profile functions \u03c70 (z) and \u03c73 (z), much in the same way it\nwas done in [4]. They have no role in the static wall solution per se. However, in\nconstructing the kinetic part of the world-volume theory for the moduli fields their\noccurrence cannot be avoided.\nThese new profile functions give rise to their own action, which must be subject\nto minimization. The gauge potentials (4.28) are introduced in order to cancel the\nx dependence of the quark fields far from the wall (in the final quark vacuum at\nz \u2192 \u221e) emerging through the x dependence of \u03c3(xn ), see Eq. (4.14).\nNow let us turn to the kinetic terms in the (2+1)-dimensional effective action\ncoming from the quark kinetic terms in (4.2). For the first flavor we have\ni\n\u2207n q r1 = \u2212 (\u2202n \u03c3) (\u03c70 \u2212 \u03c73 )\u03c6r1 .\n2\n\n(4.29)\n\nThis expression is valid far away from the edges of the domain wall, that is to say, in\nthe middle domain M, where q r1 is a non-vanishing\n\u221a constant (4.12), and at z \u2192 \u00b1\u221e\nr1\nwhere q tends to its vacuum expectation value \u03be. To ensure the finiteness of the\nkinetic energy of the first quark flavor we impose the following boundary conditions\non the functions \u03c70 and \u03c73 :\n\u03c70 \u2192 \u03c73 , z \u2192 \u00b1\u221e.\n26\n\n(4.30)\n\n\fFor the second flavor we have\ni\n\u2207n q b2 = \u2212 (\u2202n \u03c3)(\u03c70 + \u03c73 )\u03c6(z\u2212 ),\n2\n\n(4.31)\n\nwhere we introduced the quark profile function given by\n\uf8f1 \u221a\n\uf8f2\n\u03be\n\u03c6(z) = \u221a\nz \u2192 \u2213\u221e ,\n\u2206m 2\n\uf8f3\n\u03be e\u2212 2R z ,\n\n(4.32)\n\nand the shorthand\n\nR\n(4.33)\n2\nis implied. z\u00b1 are the coordinates which vanish at the wall edges.\nTo make the kinetic energy of the second quark flavor finite we impose the\nboundary conditions\n\u03c70 \u2192 \u03c73 \u2192 0,\nz \u2192 \u2212\u221e .\n(4.34)\nz\u00b1 = z \u2212 z0 \u2213\n\nA parallel procedure for those quarks that have non-vanishing VEV's in the final\nvacuum leads us to\n\u2207n q\n\nbB\n\n\u03c70 + \u03c73\n= i(\u2202n \u03c3) 1 \u2212\n\u03c6(\u2212z+ ).\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(4.35)\n\nThis gives us the desired boundary conditions for the functions \u03c7 at z \u2192 +\u221e,\n\u03c70 \u2192 \u03c73 \u2192 1,\n\nz \u2192 +\u221e .\n\n(4.36)\n\nNow we are ready to assemble all necessary elements. Substituting (4.29), (4.31)\nand (4.35) in the action and taking into account the kinetic term for the gauge fields\nwe arrive at\n\u03c3\nS2+1\n=\n\nZ\n\ndz\n\n(\n\n1\n1\n1\n(\u2202z \u03c73 )2 + 2 (\u2202z \u03c70 )2 + (\u03c70 \u2212 \u03c73 )2 (\u03c6r1 )2\n2\ng2\ng1\n2\n\n\u03c70 + \u03c73\n+ 2 1\u2212\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\n\u00132\n\n1\n\u03c6(\u2212z+ ) + (\u03c70 + \u03c73 )2 \u03c6(z\u2212 )2\n2\n2\n\n1\nd3 x (\u2202n \u03c3)2 .\n2\n\n)\n\n(4.37)\n\nThe expression in the integral over z must be viewed as an action for the \u03c7 profile\nfunctions. To get the classical solution for the BPS wall and the wall world-volume\ntheory of the moduli fields we must minimize this action. The minimization leads\nto two second-order equations for the functions \u03c70 and \u03c73 . The solutions to these\nequations are linear in the middle domain M, for both functions,\n\u03c70,3 =\n\nz \u2212 z0 + R/2\n.\nR\n27\n\n(4.38)\n\n\fFurthermore, outside the domain wall the both functions exponentially approach\ntheir boundary values (4.36), (4.34). This exponential approach is controlled by the\nphoton mass (2.18) for the U(1) field and the W-boson mass (2.17) for the SU(2)\nfield (cf. [4]). Substituting the solution (4.38) in the \u03c7 action (4.37) and taking into\naccount (4.11) we finally obtain\n\u03be Z 3 1\n\u03c3\nS2+1 =\nd x (\u2202n \u03c3)2 .\n(4.39)\n\u2206m\n2\nAs has been already mentioned previously, the compact scalar field \u03c3(t, x, y) can\nbe reinterpreted as a dual to the (2+1)-dimensional Abelian gauge field living on\nthe wall, see Eq. (4.15). Note, that Eqs. (4.28) and (4.38) demonstrate that the\nparticular combination of two U(1) gauge fields which is localized inside the wall is\nthe combination with the following alignment:\nA3n = \u2212An .\n\nThis combination corresponds to the e2 -root of the SU(3) gauge group of the \"prototheory,\" see Fig. 5. In particular, the \u03c61 quark which has a non-vanishing rcomponent inside the wall is not charged under this combination.\nThe result presented in Eq.

Thus we have four fermion fields residing\non the wall, \u03b7 \u03b1f (\u03b1, f = 1, 2). Because of the (2+1)-dimensional Lorentz invariance\nof the on-the-wall theory we are certain that these four fermion moduli fields form\ntwo (two-component) Majorana spinors. Thus, the field content of the world-volume\ntheory we obtained is in full accord with the representation of the (2+1)-dimensional\nextended supersymmetry: one complex scalar field plus one Dirac two-component\nfermion field. Minimal supersymmetry in 2+1 dimensions (with two supercharges)\nwould require one real scalar field and one Majorana two-component fermion field.\nIt is natural that we recover extended supersymmetry: there are eight supercharges\nin our microscopic theory; the domain wall at hand is 1/2 BPS; hence, we end up\nwith four supercharges in the world-volume theory.\n28\n\n\f4.4.2\n\nThe composite wall\n\nLet us pass to the discussion of the effective world-volume theory on the composite\ndomain wall 12 \u2192 34. The emphasis will be put on novel elements appearing in the\ntheory of the moduli fields on the composite wall which were absent in the case of\nthe elementary walls.\nThe first technical modification compared to Sect. 4.4.1 is that now we have four\nindependent compact moduli, rather than one - three residing in the matrix U,\nEq. (4.22) plus \u03c30 . Therefore, in order to cancel the xn -dependence of the quark\nfields far away from the wall, in the final vacuum, we have to introduce in the ansatz\nfour gauge fields,\nAn = \u03c70 (z) \u2202n \u03c3 0 (xn ) ,\n\u03c4a a\nAn = \u2212i\u03c7(z) [\u2202n U(xn )] U \u22121 (xn ) .\n2\n\n(4.43)\n\nHere \u03c7 and \u03c70 are the profile functions for SU(2) and U(1) gauge fields, respectively.\nCalculations of the quark and gauge kinetic terms run parallel to those in Sect. 4.4.1\nleading us to a key formula\ncm\nS2+1\n\n\"\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n1\ndz 2 (\u2202z \u03c70 )2 + (1 \u2212 \u03c70 )2 \u03c62 (\u2212z+ ) + \u03c720 \u03c62 (z\u2212 )\ng1\n\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\n1\nd3 x (\u2202n \u03c30 )2\n2\n\n+\n\nZ\n\n1\ndz 2 (\u2202z \u03c7)2 + (1 \u2212 \u03c7)2 \u03c62 (\u2212z+ ) + \u03c72 \u03c62 (z\u2212 )\ng2\n\n\u00d7\n\nZ\n\nd3 x Tr (U \u22121 \u2202n U) (U \u22121 \u2202n U) ,\n\n\"\n\nh\n\ni\n\n#\n\n#\n\n(4.44)\n\nwhere the superscript cm stands for compact moduli. The boundary conditions for\nthe functions \u03c7 and \u03c70 must be chosen to ensure finiteness of energy in the domains\nfar away from the wall. This gives\n\u03c70 \u2192 \u03c7 \u2192 0 ,\n\nz \u2192 \u2212\u221e ,\n\n\u03c70 \u2192 \u03c7 \u2192 1 ,\n\nz \u2192 +\u221e .\n\n(4.45)\n\nEquation (4.44) can be considered as an action functional for \u03c7 and \u03c70 .\nThe functions \u03c7 and \u03c70 are determined by minimization of the above action\nfunctional which gives a second-order equation for each function. We will not present\nthem here, since the reader can trivially get them himself/herself by minimization.\nThe solutions in the middle domain have the already familiar linear form,\n\u03c70 = \u03c7 =\n\nz \u2212 z0 + R\u0303/2\n,\nR\u0303\n29\n\n(4.46)\n\n\fwhere the size of the composite wall R\u0303 is given in Eq. (4.19). Outside the wall\nthe functions \u03c7 and \u03c70 exponentially approach their boundary values (4.45). The\nrate of approach is determined by the photon mass (2.18) for the function \u03c70 , while\nit is determined by the W -boson mass (2.17) for the function \u03c7. Substituting the\nsolution (4.46) back in the action (4.44) we obtain the following kinetic term:\ncm\nS2+1\n\n\u03be\n=\n2\u2206m\n\nZ\n\n3\n\ndx\n\n(\n\ni\ng2 h\n1\n(\u2202n \u03c30 )2 + 12 Tr (U \u22121 \u2202n U) (U \u22121 \u2202n U)\n2\ng2\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(4.47)\n\nNext, as in the elementary wall case, we can try to dualize the moduli residing\nin U, as well as \u03c30 , to convert them in (2+1)-dimensional gauge fields\n(2+1)\nFnm\n=\n\ne22+1\n\u03b5nmk \u2202 k \u03c30 ,\n2\u03c0\n\ng2\n\u03c4 a (2+1)a\nFnm\n= \u2212i 2+1 \u03b5nmk U \u22121 \u2202k U .\n2\n2\u03c0\n\n(4.48)\n\nAssembling all the above elements we obtain the action of the world-volume effective\ntheory,\nS2+1 =\n+\n\nZ\n\n3\n\ndx\n\n(\n\n1\n1\n(\u2202n a2+1 )2 + 2 (Dn aa2+1 )2\n2\n2e2+1\n2g2+1\n\n)\n1 h (2+1)a i2\n1 h (2+1) i2\nFnm\nF\n+ 2\n+ fermion terms ,\n4 e22+1\n4 g2+1 nm\n\n(4.49)\n\nof which a few comments are in order immediately.\nThe first comment refers to four non-compact a, aa moduli which emerged in\nEq. (4.49) seemingly out of blue. We can use gauge transformation in the world\n3\nvolume theory to put two of them to zero, say a1,2\n2+1 = 0. The other two a2+1 and\na2+1 should be identified with (linear combinations of) two centers of the elementary\nwalls comprising our composite wall.14 More exactly, as a2+1 has no interactions\nwhatsoever it is to be be identified with the center of mass of the composite wall,\na2+1 =\n\n1\n\u03be\u2206m e2+1 \u221a (\u03b61 + \u03b62 ) = \u03c0\u03be (\u03b61 + \u03b62 ),\n2\n\nq\n\n(4.50)\n\nwhile a32+1 can be identified with the relative separation between the elementary\nwalls,\nq\n1\ng1\n(\u03b61 \u2212 \u03b62 ),\n(4.51)\na32+1 = \u03be\u2206m g2+1 \u221a (\u03b61 \u2212 \u03b62 ) = \u03c0\u03be\ng2\n2\nwhere we use the fact that the tension of elementary walls is Tw = \u03be\u2206m.\n14\n\nNote that in Sect. 4.3 we worked out the solution for the composite wall as a bound state of\ntwo elementary walls at zero separation. However, in fact, this bound state is marginally unstable\nand has a zero mode associated with the possibility of arbitrary separation between components.\n\n30\n\n\fThe second comment is devoted to a technical (but very important!) element\nof the derivation of Eq. (4.49). In fact, this world-volume action was obtained,\nthrough the calculational procedure described above, only at the quadratic level\n(i.e. omitting non-Abelian non-linearities). This is rather obvious as our derivation,\nand in particular the identification (4.48) and the effective action (4.47), limits\nitself to the quadratic approximation. Higher-than-quadratic terms in the (3+1)dimensional action, such as the commutator term in the gauge field strength tensor,\nwould produce four-derivative terms in the (2+1)-dimensional theory (4.47). Such\nterms were explicitly omitted in the derivation above. To recover non-quadratic\n(truly non-Abelian) terms in Eq. (4.49) we use gauge invariance on the world volume.\nThe final remark is about the values of the coupling constants in the (2+1)dimensional (\"macroscopic\") theory in relation to the (3+1)-dimensional (\"microscopic\") parameters. The U(1) and SU(2) gauge coupling constants in (4.49) are\ngiven by\ne22+1 = 2\u03c0 2\n\n\u03be\n,\n\u2206m\n\n2\ng2+1\n= 2\u03c0 2\n\ng12 \u03be\n.\ng22 \u2206m\n\n(4.52)\n\nOur domain wall is a 1/2-BPS object so it preserves four supercharges on its\nworld volume. Thus, we must have the extended N = 2 supersymmetry, with four\nsupercharges, in the (2+1)-dimensional world-volume theory. This is in accord with\nEq. (4.49) in which the U(1) and SU(2) gauge fields are combined with the scalars\na2+1 and aa2+1 to form the bosonic parts of N = 2 vector multiplets.\nNow let us discuss the possibility of spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking in\nthe world volume theory. Clearly if the adjoint scalar aa2+1 develops a VEV, the\nSU(2) gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken in our world volume theory (4.49)\non the composite wall. We can always use gauge rotations to direct aa2+1 VEV along\nthird axis in the color space, ha32+1 i =\n6 0. Then identification (4.51) shows that the\nseparation l = z1 \u2212 z2 between two elementary walls which form our composite wall\nis nonvanishing. In particularly the mass of the (2+1)-dimensional W-boson is given\nby the separation between elementary walls,\nm2+1\nW = \u03c0\u03be\n\ng1\nl.\ng2\n\n(4.53)\n\nThe mass grows linearly with l. This is completely consistent with similar result for\nD-branes obtained in string theory.\nNow let us discuss how can one see this gauge symmetry breaking in the (3+1)dimensional bulk theory. Let us split our composite wall in two elementary ones,\nsay, 12 \u2192 14 and 14 \u2192 34. Now we pull these two elementary walls apart making\nthe separation much larger than the wall thickness, l \u226b R. The separation l must\nbe much larger than R because the scale 1/R plays a role of an ultraviolet cutoff in\n31\n\n\fthe world-volume theory (4.49). Clearly two well separated elementary walls have\nonly two phase collective coordinates, one per each wall, see Sect. 4.2. If we dualize\nthese phases we get two Abelian gauge fields in the effective world volume theory.\nThis corresponds to breaking of SU(2)\u00d7U(1) gauge symmetry down to U(1)\u00d7U(1)\nin (4.49). At separations l \u226b R the masses of two (2+1)-dimensional W-bosons\nbecome much larger than \u2206m (see (4.53) and they cannot be seen in the effective\nlow-energy world-volume theory.\nOne may ask where do two extra \"non-Abelian\" phases of the composite wall\ndisappear at separations larger than the elementary wall width. Of course, they do\nnot disappear. They just pass into Goldstone modes in the intermediate 14-vacuum.\nRemember that the intermediate 14-vacuum has a Higgs branch, see Sect. 2.2.2. The\ntwo extra phases are now associated with the massless moduli on this Higgs branch.\nAt zero separation these phases are collective coordinates of the composite wall.\nThey belong to the (2+1)-dimensional world-volume theory. At large separations\nthey become bulk excitations living in the intermediate vacuum. We will return to\nthis issue in Sect. 6.4 where we will show that only Abelian strings can end on the\ncomposite wall when the separation between its components gets larger than the\nthickness of the individual components.\nTo conclude this section, we reiterate that the consideration presented above\nis certainly not a \"rigorous derivation\" of the non-Abelian gauge invariance in the\neffective world-volume action (4.49). Rather, it can be viewed as a motivated argument. Our derivation is carried out only at the quadratic level and does not take\ninto account non-Abelian nonlinearities. We identify four compact collective coordinates, to be dualized into four gauge fields living on the wall. We also calculate their\nkinetic terms which fix the values of the 3D gauge coupling constants. Direct calculation of cubic and quartic interaction terms, i.e. a bona fide complete derivation,\ngoes beyond the scope of this paper. This is a task for furture work.\nThe gauge invariance in (4.47) is not apparent since (4.47) is written in terms of\ngauge invariant phases. The gauge invariance of the world-volume theory appears\nonly in Eq. (4.49), after dualization. There are quite compelling albeit indirect\narguments showing that our proposal (i.e. the SU(2)\u00d7U(1) gauge theory (4.49)) is\nthe correct generalization of (4.47). First, the number of fields matches. We have\nfour compact phases and two non-compact centers. Upon dualization, they fit into\na vector multiplet of 3D N = 2 theory with the SU(2)\u00d7U(1) gauge group. Say,\nif the gauge group were U(1)4 , we would need four phases and four non-compact\ncoordinates, which we do not have. Thus, the non-Abelian gauge symmetry of the\nworld-volume theory, in effect, is supported by supersymmetry. Second, there are\nony two distinct coupling constants in (4.47), rather than four. This also indicates\nthat three phases, upon dualization, should be unified in the SU(2) gauge theory.\n\n32\n\n\f5\n\nNon-Abelian flux tubes in N = 2 QCD\n\nIn string theory gauge fields are localized on D-branes because fundamental open\nstrings can end on D branes [1]. In Ref. [4] we demonstrated that this picture is\nalso valid in field theory, in the Abelian gauge field case. Namely, the Abelian flux\ntube was shown to end on the domain wall. The reason for such behavior is easy to\nunderstand. In the Higgs vacuum (in which electric charges condense), the magnetic\nfield is trapped into flux tubes. However, inside the wall quark fields (almost) vanish.\nTherefore, the magnetic flux which is carried by the string in the bulk can spread\nover inside the wall. The magnetic fields become electric upon dualization. The\nstring end-point plays the role of the electric charge for the gauge field localized on\nthe wall [4].\nOur task is to generalize this picture to cover the case of the non-Abelian gauge\nfields. The main goal is finding a solution for a 1/4-BPS string-wall junction, in\nwhich a string carrying a non-Abelian flux can end on the composite wall 12 \u2192 34.\nWe start implementation of the string-wall junction program in earnest in Sects. 5.2\nand 6. Meanwhile, a brief introduction in non-Abelian flux tubes will be in order,\nto acquaint the reader with the necessary machinery. An advanced investigation of\nnon-Abelian flux tubes in various regimes will be described elsewhere [32].\nVortices in non-Abelian theories were studied in many papers in recent years\n[38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 13]. However, in all these examples of vortex solutions, the\nstring flux is always directed in the Cartan subalgebra of the gauge group. This\nimplies a (hidden) Abelian nature of these strings. Clearly these strings cannot\nbe used for our purposes because their end-points on domain walls cannot act as\nsources for non-Abelian fields.\nOnly recently a special regime was found [6] in which flux tubes acquire orientational zero modes which allow one to freely rotate the string flux inside a non-Abelian\ngroup. This special regime is associated with the presence of a certain combination\nof global gauge and flavor symmetry not broken by VEV's of scalar fields. Below\nwe will show that precisely this regime is realized in 12- and 34-vacua of the theory\nunder consideration.\nThe theory analyzed in Ref. [6] is N = 2 QCD with the SU(3) gauge group\nbroken down to SU(2)\u00d7 U(1), with four quark flavors, all with the same mass.\nWe review the string solution found in this paper and adapt the analysis to our\nSU(2)\u00d7U(1) model. To begin with, however, we present some general arguments in\na simple toy model.\n\n5.1\n\nHow \"non-Abelian\" are non-Abelian strings we deal\nwith?\n\nIn Ref. [24] it was proven that the only BPS-saturated strings at weak coupling in\nN = 1 theories are those of the ANO type, occurring in U(1) theories. Here we\nspeak of \"non-Abelian\" BPS strings in N = 2. A natural question to ask is in\n33\n\n\fwhich sense the BPS flux tubes under consideration are Non-Abelian strings. A\nconceptual answer can be given in a simplified model which does not even need to\nbe supersymmetric.\nIndeed, let us consider a (non-supersymmetric) model which generalizes that of\nAbrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen, and has two gauge groups, SU(2) and U(1), and scalar\n(1)\n(2)\nfields of two flavors.15 Denote two SU(2) doublet fields by \u03c6i and \u03c6j , i, j = 1, 2.\nThen, introduce a 2\u00d72 matrix field\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03a6=\uf8ed\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c61\n\n\u03c61\n\n(1)\n\u03c62\n\n(2)\n\u03c62\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(5.1)\n\n\uf8f8\n\nThe covariant derivatives are defined in such a way that they act from the left,\n\u0012\n\n\u2207\u03bc \u03a6 \u2261 \u2202\u03bc \u2212\n\ni\n\u03c4a\n\u03a6,\nA\u03bc \u2212 iAa\u03bc\n2\n2\n\u0013\n\n(5.2)\n\nWe assume the action to have the form\nS =\n\nZ\n\n4\n\ndx\n\n\"\n\n1\n1 \u0010 a \u00112\nF\u03bc\u03bd + 2 (F\u03bc\u03bd )2\n2\n4g2\n4g1\ni\n\n+ Tr(\u2207\u03bc \u03a6)\u2020 (\u2207\u03bc \u03a6) + V (\u03a6) ,\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhere, for the time being, the potential function V is assumed to be gauge invariant\nas well as invariant under the global U(2)\n\u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6UR .\n\n(5.4)\n\nHere UR is a constant matrix from U(2), and the multiplication is performed from\nthe right.

(5.4).\nModels of the type (5.3) were engineered long ago [44] with the purpose of\nproviding a set up for the spontaneous breaking of the local (gauge) group G down\nto a diagonal global G. Indeed, with an appropriate choice of the potential function\nV , one can ensure the vacuum expectation value of \u03a6 to be diagonal,\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03a6vac = v \uf8ed\n\n1 0\n0 1\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n,\n\nv 6= 0 .\n\n(5.6)\n\nThen, since this vacuum is obviously invariant under the combined multiplication\n\n15\n\n\u03a6 \u2192 UL \u03a6UR ,\n\nThis model is also a version of the Higgs sector of the Standard model.\n\n34\n\n(5.7)\n\n\fx\nLarge\ncircle\n\n\u03b1\nString\naxis z\nx\n\ny\n\nx0\n\nFigure 6: Geometry of the string.\nwith UR = UL\u2020 , the diagonal global U(2) will be preserved.\nNow we can discuss topological defects of the string type. Defects of the ANO\ntype are always possible. Indeed, put the SU(2) gauge field to zero (and temporarily\nforget about it whatsoever). A non-trivial topology will be realized through the U(1)\nwinding of \u03a6,\n\u03a6(x) = ei\u03b1(x) v ,\n|x| \u2192 \u221e ,\n(5.8)\n\nand\n\nxk\n,\n(5.9)\nr\nwhere \u03b1 is the phase in the perpendicular plane, and r is the distance from the\nstring axis in the perpendicular plane. Since \u03c01 (U(1)) = Z, we will get in this way\na set of the ANO flux tubes with the arbitrary windings.\nThese are not the strings we are after, however. At first sight, the presence of the\nSU(2) gauge symmetry, in addition to U(1), does not create any new possibilities.\nIndeed, \u03c01 (SU(2)) is trivial; one can readily unwind windings in SU(2) relevant to\nstrings.\nNevertheless, the fact that SU(2) has a center, Z2 , does create a new possibility.16\nTo see that this is the case, let us examine the following topology. A large circle\nin the plane perpendicular to the string axis is depicted in Fig. 6 Assume that one\nstarts from a certain point on this circle and makes a full rotation around the string.\nIntroduce the winding in SU(2), and assume the full rotation above to bring us to\nthe same element up to the center, namely\nAl = \u22122 \u03b5lk\n\n\u03a6(x) = ei~\u03c9(x)~\u03c4 /2 \u03a6(x0 ) \u2192 \u2212\u03a6(x0 ) at x \u2192 x0\n\nafter rot.,\n\n(5.10)\n\nsee Fig. 7. The condition (5.10) per se is forbidden, since it results in a discontinuity\nof the \u03a6 field. One can eliminate this discontinuity by supplementing the SU(2)\nwinding above by a U(1) winding with the condition\n16\n\n\u03a6(x) = ei\u03b1(x)/2 \u03a6(x0 ) \u2192 \u2212\u03a6(x0 ) at x \u2192 x0\n\nafter rot.,\n\n(5.11)\n\nOf course, any element of U(1) can be considered as a center, since this group is Abelian.\n\n35\n\n\fSU(2)\nU(1)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7: Topology of the (1,0) and (0,1) strings. The trajectories in the group spaces\ncorresponding to circumnavigating along the large circle in Fig. 6 are denoted by\nbold lines.\nThe formula\n1 \u00b1 \u03c43\n\u03a6(x) = exp i\u03b1(x)\n2\n\n!\n\n\u03a6(x0 ) ,\n\n\u03b1(x) \u2192 2\u03c0\n\nafter rot.,\n\n(5.12)\n\nsummarizes this pattern. Depending on the choice of the sign in the exponent,\nonly the r or only the b components of the fields \u03c6(1,2) have a non-trivial winding.\nIt is clear from Fig. 7 that one cannot unwind it. It is also clear that the fluxes\ncorresponding to the fields A\u03bc and A3\u03bc are half the flux of the U(1) field of the ANO\nstring. We will refer to such strings as (1, 0) and (0, 1) - the first winding number\ncorresponding to the index r, the second to b. This notation seems rather awkward\ngiven the way we introduced the set up. It emerges naturally within the historical\nline of development, however; see below. The standard ANO string emerges as a sum\nof the (1, 0) and (0, 1) strings. The question as to which strings are more favorable\nenergetically depends on dynamical details. We will return to it later.\nA remarkable feature of the (1, 0) and (0, 1) strings is the appearance of nonAbelian moduli which are absent in the ANO strings. Indeed, while the vacuum\nfield (5.6) is invariant under the global SU(2) by virtue of Eq. (5.7), the string\nconfiguration (5.12) is not. Therefore, if there is a solution of the form (5.12) there\nis a family of solutions obtained from (5.12) by the replacement\n\u03a6(x) \u2192 \u03a9\u03c6(x)\u03a9\u2020\n\n(5.13)\n\nwhere \u03a9 is an x-independent matrix from U(2). Generally speaking, it is parametrized\nby four parameters. The U(1) factor is nothing but a shift of the origin of the angle\n\u03b1, however; one should not count it. Thus, what remains is SU(2). Moreover, in\nfact, it is SU(2)/U(1), as is clearly seen from Eq. (5.12). (Rotations around the third\naxis in the SU(2) space leave the solution intact.) SU(2)/U(1) is the target space of\nthe CP 1 (or O(3)) sigma model which, thus, provides the adequate description of\nthe moduli dynamics [5, 6].\n36\n\n\fIt is just this aspect that allows us to refer to the strings above as \"non-Abelian.\"\nThey are as non-Abelian as it gets at weak coupling.\nNote that the stability of the (1, 0) and (0, 1) strings under consideration would\nbe impossible without the presence of the U(1) factor.\nIn conclusion, it is instructive to ask what happens if we explicitly break the\nSU(2) flavor symmetry of the model (5.3) by introducing unequal masses to the\nfields \u03c6(1) and \u03c6(2) , namely,\nSM =\n\nZ\n\nd4 x Tr(\u03a6M2 \u03a6\u2020 ) ,\n\n(5.14)\n\nwhere the mass matrix has the form\n\uf8eb\n\nM2 = \uf8ed\n\nm21\n\n0\n\n0\n\nm22\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\nm21 6= m22 .\n\n,\n\n(5.15)\n\nIntuitively it is clear that if \u2206m2 is small, the only change is as follows: the SU(2)\nsymmetry of the CP 1 model must be broken, producing quasi-moduli from the\nwould-be moduli of CP 1 . What survives is U(1), rather than SU(2). Later, after\nre-introduction of supersymmetry, we will see that this process is nothing but the\ntransition from the N = 2 CP 1 model to the one with the twisted mass.17 Anticipating our further needs we present here the bosonic part of the CP 1 model with\nthe twisted mass,\nn\no\nLCP(1),t.m. = G \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u0304\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 |m\u0303|2 \u03c6\u0304\u03c6 ,\n(5.16)\nwhere G is the metric on the target space,\nG\u2261\n\n2\n1\n\u0010\n\u0011 ,\n2\ng 1 + \u03c6\u03c6\u0304 2\n\n(5.17)\n\nand\n\u03c7 \u2261 1 + \u03c6\u03c6\u0304 .\n\n(It is useful to note that the Ricci tensor R = 2 \u03c7\u22122 .) The twisted mass parameter\nm\u0303 introduced in Eq. (5.16) is related to the mass splitting \u2206m of the microscopic\ntheory, m\u0303 = \u2206m.\nAnticipating further applications, we hasten to add that the N = 2 superalgebra\nof the CP 1 model (which is our macroscopic theory) is centrally extended, namely,\n{QL Q\u0304R } = \u2212i m\u0303qU(1) \u2212 m\u0303\n17\n\nZ\n\ndz \u2202z h +\n\n1\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ndz \u2202z \u03c7\u22122 \u03a8\u0304R \u03a8L ,\n\n(5.18)\n\nN = 2 sigma models with twisted mass were first constructed in Ref. [45]. The superspace/superfield description was developed in Refs. [46, 47]. In particular, the notion of a twisted\nchiral superfield was introduced in the second of these works. The word \"twisted\" appears for the\nfirst time in the given context in Ref. [47].\n\n37\n\n\fwhere the first term is proportional to the U(1) charge qU(1) , while in the second\nterm h = \u2212 g22 \u03c71 presents the main impact of the twisted mass. The last term is the\ncentral charge anomaly established in Ref. [33]. It is proportional to the difference\nbetween the bifermion condensates in the final and initial vacua. The central charge\nanomaly becomes important in the limit m\u0303 \u2192 0 corresponding to m1 \u2192 m2 in the\nmicroscopic theory. Then the classical terms \u223c qU(1) and \u223c h vanish, and the central\ncharge is entirely determined by the anomaly.\nThe above central charge is in one-to-one correspondence with the BPS kinks\nin the CP 1 model. Sure enough, it must (and does) have a counterpart in the\nmicroscopic theory, see Sect. 3.3. Projecting them onto one another allows one\nto establish relations between the parameters of the microscopic and macroscopic\ntheories [32], for instance,\n1\n2\u03c0\n= 2.\n(5.19)\n2\ngCP 1\ng2\nLet us note that g22 in runs according to the formula of asymptotic freedom down\nto \u03be, (at \u2206m = 0), where it is frozen in the bulk. The asymptotic freedom running\n2\nof g22 is taken over and matched by that of gCP\n1 in the macroscopic (world-volume)\ntheory.\n\nBack to strings in N = 2\n\n5.2\n\nFor definiteness let us consider strings in the 12-vacuum. To find the BPS string\nsolutions we use the same ansatz as in Eq. (4.1) and also put adjoint fields, which\nare irrelevant for the string solutions, equal to their VEV's (2.12). With these\nsimplifications our theory (4.2) becomes\nS =\n\n+\n\nZ\n\n4\n\ndx\n\n\"\n\n1\n1 \u0010 a \u00112\nF\u03bc\u03bd + 2 (F\u03bc\u03bd )2 + \u2207\u03bc \u03c6A\n2\n4g2\n4g1\n\n\u00112\n\u00112\ng22 \u0010\ng2 \u0010\n\u03c6\u0304A \u03c4 a \u03c6A + 1 \u03c6\u0304A \u03c6A \u2212 2\u03be\n,\n8\n8\n#\n\n2\n\n(5.20)\n\nClearly, only those two flavors A = 1, 2 which develop VEV's in the 12-vacuum\nwill play a role in the classical vortex solution. Other flavors remain vanishing\non the solution. Hence, we consider the quark fields \u03c6kA to be 2 \u00d7 2 matrices in\nthis section. Note, however, that the additional two flavors are crucial in quantum\ntheory, in keeping the SU(2) interactions weak.\nThe string tension can be written \u00e0 la Bogomolny [34] as follows:\nT =\n\n+\n\nZ\n\nd2 x\n\n(\"\n\n1\ng \u0010\n\u221a F3\u2217a \u00b1 \u221a2 \u03c6\u0304A \u03c4 a \u03c6A\n2g2\n2 2\n2\n\n\u001b\n\n\u22071 \u03c6A \u00b1 i\u22072 \u03c6A \u00b1 \u03beF3\u2217 ,\n\n!#2\n\n\"\n\n#2\n\n\u0011\n1\ng1 \u0010\n+ \u221a F3\u2217 \u00b1 \u221a |\u03c6A |2 \u2212 2\u03be\n2g1\n2 2\n\n(5.21)\n38\n\n\fwhere\n\n1\n(i, j = 1, 2),\n(5.22)\nF3\u2217 \u2261 \u01ebij Fij ,\n2\nplus the same for F3\u2217 a , are the coordinates in the plane orthogonal to the string axis\ndirected along the third (i.e. z) axis.

For unequal quark\nmasses some of the orientational moduli become quasi-moduli, corresponding to\npassing from the CP 1 sigma model with no twisted mass to that with a twisted\nmass, see Sect. 5.1.\nThe U(1)\u00d7U(1) strings can be recognized, with no effort, as particular solutions\nof Eqs. (5.23). To construct them we further restrict the gauge fields Aa\u03bc to a single\n(third) color component A3\u03bc (by setting A1\u03bc = A2\u03bc = 0), and consider only the quark\nfields of the 2 \u00d7 2 color-flavor diagonal form,\n\u03c6kA (x) 6= 0,\n\nfor k = A = 1, 2,\n\n(5.24)\n\nwith vanishing other components.

To\nbe more specific, assume that the first flavor winds n times while the second flavor\nwinds k times. The solutions of Eq.

Here the sign of the string flux is defined as\n\u03b5 = \u03b5n,k =\n\nn+k\n= sign(n + k) = \u00b11.\n|n + k|\n\n(5.30)\n\nThe tension of a (n, k)-string is determined by the flux of the U(1) gauge field\nalone and is given by the formula [13, 6]\nTn,k = 2\u03c0 \u03be |n + k|.\n\n(5.31)\n\nNote that F3\u22173 does not enter the central charge of the N = 2 algebra and,\ntherefore, does not affect the string tension. The stability of the string in this case\nis due to the U(1) factor of the SU(2)\u00d7U(1) group only. Note also that (1, 0) and\n(0, 1)-strings are exactly degenerate.\nFor a generic (n, k)-string equations (5.27) do not reduce to the standard Bogomolny equations. For instance, for the (1,1)-string these equations reduce to two\nBogomolny equations while for the (1,0) and (0,1) strings they do not. Numerical\nsolutions for the two \"elementary\" (1,0) and (0,1) strings were obtained in Ref.

This is possible, since both, string fluxes and the\nmonopole charges, are elements of the group \u03c01 (U(1)2 ) = Z 2 . This convention is\nquite convenient because specifying the flux of a given string automatically fixes the\ncharge of the monopole that it confines.\nOur strings are formed as a result of the quark condensation; the quarks have\nelectric charges equal to the weights of the SU(3) algebra. The Dirac quantization\ncondition tells us [13] that the lattice of the (n, k)-strings is formed by roots of the\nSU(3) algebra. The lattice of (n, k)-strings is shown in Fig. 8. Two strings, (1, 0)\nand (0, 1), are the \"elementary\" or \"minimal.\" They are BPS-saturated. All other\nstrings can be considered as bound states of these \"elementary\" strings. If we plot\ntwo lines along the charges of these \"elementary\" strings (Fig. 8) they divide the\nlattice into four sectors. It turns out [13] that the strings in the upper and lower\nsectors are BPS but they are marginally unstable. At the same time, the strings in\nthe right and left sectors are (meta)stable bound states of the \"elementary\" ones\nbut they are not BPS.\nNow, let us generalize the string solutions (5.26) to the case of the equal quark\nmasses, when the SU(2)\u00d7U(1) gauge group is not broken by the difference of the\nquark masses, as is the case in the 12-vacuum. The relevant homotopy group in this\ncase is the fundamental group\n\u03c01\n\nSU(2) \u00d7 U(1)\nZ2\n\n!\n\n=Z,\n\n(5.32)\n\nreplacing Eq. (5.25). This means that the lattice of (n, k)-strings reduces to a tower\nlabeled by one integer (n + k). For instance, the (1, \u22121)-string becomes completely\nunstable. On the restored SU(2) -group manifold it corresponds to a winding along\n41\n\n\fthe meridian on the sphere S3 . Clearly this winding can be shrunk to nothing by\ncontracting the loop towards the north or south poles [37].\nOn the other hand, the (1, 0) and (0, 1) strings cannot be shrunk because their\nwinding is half a circle (Fig. 7). They have the same tension\nT1 = 2\u03c0\u03be\n\n(5.33)\n\nfor equal quark masses and, thus, apparently belong to a doublet of SU(2) .\nBelow we will show that there is a continuous deformation of the (1, 0)-string solution transforming it into a (0, 1)-string. This deformation leaves the string tension\nunchanged and, therefore, corresponds to an orientational zero mode [6].\nFirst let us fix the unitary gauge (at least globally, which is enough for our\npurposes) by imposing the condition that the squark VEV's are given precisely by\n(2.13), and so all gauge phases vanish. Now transform the (1, 0)-string solution\n(5.26) into the unitary gauge, which corresponds to the singular gauge, in which the\nstring flux comes from the singularity of the gauge potential at zero. In this gauge\nthe solution (5.26) for the (1, 0)-string takes the form\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03c6kA = \uf8ed\nA3i (x) = \u01ebij\n\n\u03c61 (r)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03c62 (r)\n\nxj\nf3 (r),\nr2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\nAi (x) = \u01ebij\n\nxj\nf (r) .\nr2\n\n(5.34)\n\nNow, please, observe that a global diagonal subgroup in the product of gauge and\nflavor symmetries SU(2)C \u00d7SU(2)F is not broken by the quark VEV's. Namely,\nUC+F hqi U\u22121\nC+F = hqi ,\n\n(5.35)\n\nwhere UC+F is a global rotation in SU(2) while the quark VEV matrix is given by\nEq. (2.13). We refer to this unbroken group as SU(2)C+F .\nLet us apply this global rotation to the (1, 0) string solution (5.34). We find\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03c6kA = UC+F \uf8ed\n\n\u03c61 (r)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03c62 (r)\n\n1 a a xj\n\u03c4a a\nAi (x) =\nn \u03c4 \u01ebij 2 f3 (r) ,\n2\n2\nr\nAi (x) = \u01ebij\n\nxj\nf (r) ,\nr2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8 U\u22121\n\nC+F ,\n\n(5.36)\n\nwhere we define\na a\nUC+F \u03c4 3 U\u22121\nC+F = n \u03c4 .\n\nHere na is a unit vector on S2 , ~n2 = 1.\n42\n\n(5.37)\n\n\fIt is easy to check that the rotated string (5.36) is a solution to the non-Abelian\nfirst-order equations (5.23). Clearly the solution (5.36) interpolates between (1, 0)\nand (0, 1) strings. In particular it gives a (1, 0)-string for n = (0, 0, 1) and a (0, 1)string for n = (0, 0, \u22121).\nThe vector ~n has a clear-cut physical meaning. Its orientation is the orientation\nof the magnetic flux. The construction above - which was carried out in the singular\ngauge - shows that the SU(2) flux of the string is directed along the vector na . This\nfact becomes even more transparent, if we examine a gauge-invariant definition of\nthe magnetic flux of the non-Abelian string, which is very instructive. This can be\ndone as follows. Define \"non-Abelian\" field strength (to be denoted by bold letters)\nas follows:\n!\nb\n1\n\u2217a\n\u2020 \u2217b \u03c4\na\nF3 = Tr \u03a6 F3\n(5.38)\n\u03a6\u03c4\n\u03be\n2\nFrom the very definition it is clear that this field is gauge invariant. Moreover, it is\nclear from (5.36) that\n2\n2\na (\u03c61 + \u03c62 ) 1 df3\nF\u2217a\n=\n\u2212n\n.\n(5.39)\n3\n2\u03be\nr dr\nThus, the physical meaning of these moduli is as follows. The flux of the colormagnetic field in the flux tube is directed along ~n. We see that the SU(2)C+F\nsymmetry is physical and does not correspond to any of the gauge rotations which\nare \"eaten up\" by the Higgs mechanism. At the same time, a non-Abelian gauge\ngroup - a \"new color\" - is resurrected. For strings in Eq. (5.26) the \"new-color\"magnetic flux is directed along the third axis in the O(3) group space, either upward\nor downward.\nThe SU(2)C+F symmetry is exact and the tension of the string solution (5.36) is\nindependent of na , see (5.33). However, an explicit vortex solution breaks the exact\nSU(2)C+F in the following manner:\nSU(2)C+F \u2192 U(1) .\n\n(5.40)\n\nTwo angles associated with vector na becomes two orientational bosonic zero modes\nof the string. The vector na parametrize the quotient space SU(2)/U(1)\u223c CP 1 \u223c S 2 .\nThis means that, as we have already explained in Sect. 5.1, the (1+1)-dimensional\nlow-energy effective theory for these orientational zero modes is the O(3) sigma\nmodel (O(3) sigma model is the same as CP 1 sigma model; if we started from SQCD\nwith the gauge group SU(N)\u00d7U(1), we would instead arrive [5, 6] at CP N \u22121 ). Since\nthe string is 1/2-BPS saturated we have four supercharges in the effective world\nsheet theory. This corresponds to N = 2 supersymmetry in (1+1)-dimensions.\nClassically the O(3) sigma model is characterized by a spontaneous breaking of\nthe O(3) symmetry leading to two massless Goldstone bosons. This is to say that\nin the quasiclassical treatment the vector na points in some particular direction for\na given string.\n\n43\n\n\fHowever, quantum physics of N = 2 sigma model is quite different. The model\nis asymptotically free and runs into a strong coupling regime at low energies. This\ntheory has a dynamically generated mass gap\n\u039bCP 1 \u223c\n\nq\n\n2\n\u03be exp (\u22122\u03c0/gCP\n1) \u223c\n\nq\n\n\u03be exp (\u22124\u03c0 2 /g22) .\n\n(5.41)\n\nThere is no spontaneous breaking of O(3), and no Goldstone bosons are generated.\nIn terms of strings in four dimensions this means that the string orientation vector\nna has no particular direction. The O(3) sigma model has two vacua [48]. In the\nmicroscopic four-dimensional picture this means that we have two \"elementary\"\nnon-Abelian strings which form a doublet with respect to SU(2)C+F .\nNote however, that they are not the (1, 0) and (0, 1) strings of the quasiclassical\nU(1)\u00d7U(1) theory. In both strings the vector na has no particular direction. Still\nthe number of \"elementary\" string states remains the same - two - in the limit\nof equal quark masses.\nThe O(3) sigma model has a kink interpolating between the two vacua. In four\ndimensions this interpolation will be interpreted as a monopole which produces a\njunction of two \"elementary\" non-Abelian strings [6, 7]. This monopole lives on the\nstring world sheet because monopoles are in the confining phase in our theory, and\ndo not exist as free states.\nThe charge of this monopole lies entirely inside the SU(2) factor of the gauge\ngroup. If \u2206m 6= 0, its charge is (1, \u22121). Classically the mass of this monopole is\n\u2206m (4\u03c0/g22) and tends to zero when the gauge symmetry is enhanced from U(1)\u00d7U(1)\nto SU(2)\u00d7U(1) at \u2206m = 0. Simultaneously its size becomes infinite (cf. [49]). However, in quantum theory the story is different. This monopole has a finite size since\nthere are no massless states in the O(3) sigma model. It is massive but extremely\nlight with a mass determined by the scale of the sigma model \u039bCP 1 , see Eq. (5.41).\nThe mass of this monopole is lifted from zero and is given by the anomalous term\nin the central charge (5.18) of the O(3) sigma model. Its charge is no longer (1, \u22121)\nbecause it interpolates now between quantum vacua of the O(3) sigma model for\nwhich the vector na has no particular direction. Further details are reported in [32].\n\n6\n\nString-wall junctions\n\nIn this section we derive the BPS equations and find a 1/4-BPS solutions for stringwall junctions. First we work out the first-order equations for string-wall junctions\nthen find a solution of Abelian string ending on the elementary wall and, finally,\ndiscuss a non-Abelian string ending on the composite wall.\n\n6.1\n\nFirst-order equations for junctions\n\nIn Ref. [4] we found string-wall junction solution picking up two supercharges (1/4\nBPS!) which act trivially both on the string and wall solutions. Here we take\n44\n\n\fa slightly different route inspecting the Bogomolny representation for the energy\nfunctional. We keep the quark, adjoint and gauge fields in our action because all of\nthese fields play a role in the string-wall junction.\nIt is natural to assume that at large separations from the string end-point at\nr = 0, z = 0, the wall is almost parallel to the (x1 , x2 ) plane while the string is\nstretched along the z axis at negative z. Since both solutions, for the string and the\nwall, were obtained using the ansatz (4.1) we restrict our search for the wall-string\njunction to the same ansatz. As usual, we look for a static solution assuming that\nall relevant fields can depend only on xn , (n = 1, 2, 3).\nThen we can represent the energy functional of our theory (4.2) as follows:\nE =\n\nZ\n\n+\n\n\"\n\n\uf8f1\"\n\uf8f2\n\n\u0011\n1\n1\ng2 \u0010\nd x \u221a F3\u2217a + \u221a \u03c6\u0304A \u03c4 a \u03c6A + D3 aa\n\uf8f3\ng2\n2g2\n2 2\n3\n\n#2\n\n#2\n\n\u0011\n1\n1\ng \u0010\n\u221a F3\u2217 + \u221a1 |\u03c6A |2 \u2212 2\u03be + \u22023 a\ng1\n2g1\n2 2\n\"\n\n1 1\n+ 2 \u221a (F1\u2217a + iF2\u2217a ) + (D1 + iD2 )aa\ng2\n2\n\n#2\n\n#2\n\n\"\n\n1 1\n+ 2 \u221a (F1\u2217 + iF2\u2217 ) + (\u22021 + i\u22022 )a\ng1\n2\n+\n\n\u22071 \u03c6A + i\u22072 \u03c6\n\n+\n\nsurface terms,\n\nA 2\n\n\uf8fc\n\n2\uf8fd\n\u0011\n\u221a\n1 \u0010\n+ \u22073 \u03c6A + \u221a aa \u03c4 a + a + 2mA \u03c6A\n\uf8fe\n2\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere we assume that the quark mass terms and adjoint fields are real.

Eq. (5.22). This is in full accord with the general discussion in Sect. 3.\nThe Bogomolny representation (6.1) leads us to the following first-order equations:\n\u221a\nF1\u2217 + iF2\u2217 + 2(\u22021 + i\u22022 )a = 0 ,\n45\n\n\fF1\u2217a + iF2\u2217a +\nF3\u2217\n\ng2\n+ 1\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u221a\n\nA 2\n\n2(D1 + iD2 )aa = 0 ,\n\u0013\n\n\u2212 2\u03be +\n\n\u221a\n\n2 \u22023 a = 0 ,\n\n\u0011 \u221a\ng22 \u0010\n\u03c6\u0304A \u03c4 a \u03c6A + 2 D3 aa = 0 ,\n2\n\u0011\n\u221a\n1 \u0010\n\u22073 \u03c6A = \u2212 \u221a aa \u03c4 a + a + 2mA \u03c6A ,\n2\n\nF3\u2217a +\n\n(\u22071 + i\u22072 )\u03c6A = 0 .\n\n(6.4)\n\nThese are our master equations.\nOnce these equations are satisfied the energy of the BPS object is given by\nEq. (6.2). Please, observe that Eq. (6.2) has three terms corresponding to central\ncharges of the string, domain wall and monopoles of the SU(2) subgroup, respectively. Say, for the string the three-dimensional integral in the first term in Eq. (6.2)\ngives the string length times its flux. For the wall the two-dimensional integral in the\nsecond term in (6.2) gives the area of a wall times the tension. For the monopole the\nintegral in the last term in (6.2) gives the monopole flux. This means that our master equations (6.4) can be used to study the BPS strings, domain walls, monopoles,\nand all their possible junctions.\nIt is instructive to check that the wall, string and monopole solutions, separately,\nsatisfy these equations. Say, we start from the wall solution. In this case the gauge\nfields are put to zero, and all fields depend only on z. Thus, the first two and the\nlast two equations in (6.4) are trivially satisfied. The components of the gauge fields\nF3\u2217 and F3\u2217a vanish in the third and fourth equations; hence these equations reduce\nto the last two equations in Eq. (4.4). The fifth equation in (6.4) coincides with the\nfirst one in (4.4).\nFor the string which lies, say, in the 12-vacuum, all quark fields vanish except\nq A , A = 1, 2 while a and aa are given by their VEV's. The gauge flux is directed\nalong the z axis, so that F1\u2217 = F2\u2217 = F1\u2217a = F2\u2217a = 0. All fields depend only on the\ncoordinates x1 and x2 . Then the first two equations and the fifth one in (6.4) are\ntrivially satisfied. The third and the fourth equation reduce to the first two ones in\nEq. (5.23). The last equation in (6.4) for A = 1, 2 reduces to the last equation in\n(5.23), while for B = 3, 4 these equations are trivially satisfied.\nEquations for the monopole arise from the ones in (6.4) in the limit \u03be = 0. Then\nall quark fields vanish, and Eq. (6.4) reduces to the standard first-order equation for\nthe monopole in the BPS limit,\n\u221a\nFn\u2217a + 2Dn aa = 0,\n(6.5)\nwhile a is given by its VEV and the U(1) gauge field vanishes.\nIn particular, Eq. (6.2) shows that the central charge of the SU(2) monopole is\ndetermined by ha3 i which is proportional to the quark mass difference in the given\n46\n\n\fvacuum. Say, for the monopole in the 12-vacuum it gives zero. However, as was\nmentioned at the end of Sect. 5.2, the mass of this monopole is lifted from zero at\n\u03be 6= 0. In this case this monopole becomes a junction of two \"elementary\" strings of\nthe SU(2)\u00d7U(1) theory and acquires a nonvanishing mass due to non-perturbative\neffects in the O(3) sigma model on the string world sheet.\nLet us note that the Abelian version of the first-order master equations (6.4)\nwas first derived in Ref. [4] and used to find a 1/4-BPS solution for the string-wall\njunction. Quite recently a non-Abelian version for SU(2)\u00d7 U(1) theory was used\n[7] to study the junction of two \"elementary\" strings via a small-size monopole at\n\u2206m 6= 0 and large.\n\n6.2\n\nThe Abelian string ending on the elementary wall\n\nIn this section we consider an Abelian string ending on the elementary wall. The\n12 \u2192 14 wall has a nonvanishing r-component of the first flavor inside the wall, see\nSect. 4.2. Therefore, only the (0,1)-string whose flux is orthogonal to the r-weight\nvector can end on this wall.\nNeedless to say the solution of the first-order equations (6.4) for the string ending\non the wall can be found only numerically, especially near the end-point of the string\nwhere both the string and the wall profiles are heavily deformed. However, far from\nthe string end-point, deformations are weak and we can find the asymptotic behavior\nanalytically.\nLet the string be on the z < 0 side of the wall, inside the 12-vacuum. Consider\nfirst the region z \u2192 \u2212\u221e far away from the string end-point at z \u223c 0. Then the\nsolution to (6.4) is given by an almost unperturbed string. Namely, at z \u2192 \u2212\u221e\nthere is no z dependence to the leading order, and, hence, the solution\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03c6kA = \uf8ed\n\n\u03c62 (r)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03c61 (r)\n\nA3i (x) = \u2212\u01ebij\nAi (x) = \u01ebij\n\nxj\nf3 (r) ,\nr2\n\nxj\nf (r),\nr2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n(6.6)\n\n(which is a singular-gauge version of the solution (5.26) for n = 0, k = 1, cf.\nEq. (5.34)) satisfies Eqs. (6.4). We also take the fields A3 = Aa3 = 0 and \u03c6B\n(B = 3, 4) to be zero, with a's equal to their VEV's (2.12). On the other side of the\nwall, at z \u2192 +\u221e, we have an almost unperturbed 14-vacuum with the fields given\nby their respective VEV's.\nNow consider the domain r \u2192 \u221e at small z. In this domain the solution to\nEq. (6.4) is given by a perturbation of the wall solution. Let us use the ansatz in\nwhich the solutions for the fields a, aa and \u03c6A are given by the same equations (4.9),\n(4.12), (4.13) and (4.14) in which the size of the wall is still given by (4.11), and the\n47\n\n\fonly modification is that the position of the wall z0 and the phase \u03c3 now become\nslowly-varying functions of r and \u03b1 (i.e. the polar coordinates on the (x1 , x2 ) plane).\nIt is quite obvious that z0 will depend only on r.\nAs long as the third, fourth and fifth equations in (6.4) do not contain derivatives\nwith respect to xi , i = 1, 2, they are identically satisfied for any functions z0 (r, \u03b1)\nand \u03c3(r, \u03b1) (note, that F3\u2217 = F3\u2217a = 0, the field strength is almost parallel to the\ndomain wall plane and A3 = Aa3 = 0).\nHowever, the first two and the last two equations in (6.4) become nontrivial.\nConsider the first two. Inside the string the gauge fields are directed along the z\naxis and their fluxes are 2\u03c0 for F3\u2217 and \u22122\u03c0 for F3\u22173 (remember, we treat the (0,1)string). This flux is spread out inside the wall and directed almost along xi in the\n(x1 , x2 ) plane at large r. Since the flux is conserved, we have\n1 xi\nR r2\n\nFi\u2217 =\n\nFi\u22173 = \u2212\n\n1 xi\n,\nR r2\n\n(6.7)\n\ninside the wall at |z \u2212 z0 (r, \u03b1)| < R/2.\nSubstituting this in the first two equations in (6.4) and assuming that z0 depends\nonly on r we get that the two equations are consistent with each other and\n\u2202r z0 =\n\n1\n.\n\u2206mr\n\n(6.8)\n\nNeedless to say our \"adiabatic\" approximation holds only provided\nthe above deriva\u221a\ntive is small, i.e. sufficiently far from the string end point, \u03ber \u226b 1.\nThe solution to this equation is straightforward,\nz0 =\n\n1\nln r + const.\n\u2206m\n\n(6.9)\n\nWe see that the wall is logarithmically bent according to the Coulomb law in 2+1\ndimensions. Similar to the case considered in [4], one can show that this bending\nproduces a balance of forces between the string and the wall in the z direction so\nthat the whole configuration is static.\nNow let us consider the last equation in (6.4). First, we will dwell on the gauge\npotential which enters the covariant derivatives in this equation. In order to produce\nthe field strength (6.7), A\u03bc and Aa\u03bc in the middle domain should reduce to\nAi\n\n1\nR\nxj\n=\n,\n\u03b5ij 2 z \u2212 z0 (r) +\nR r\n2\n\nA3i\n\n1\nxj\nR\n= \u2212 \u03b5ij 2 z \u2212 z0 (r) +\n,\nR r\n2\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\nA0 = A30 = 0,\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\nA3 = A33 = 0 .\n48\n\ni = 1, 2 ,\ni = 1, 2 ,\n(6.10)\n\n\fPlease, observe that nonvanishing field of the first quark flavor satisfies the equation\nsince it has only the r-component which is not charged with respect to the field\n(6.10). Consider the second quark flavor whose b-component is given by (4.13) in\nthe middle domain near the left edge of the wall at z \u2212 z0 \u223c \u2212R/2. Taking into\naccount the gauge potentials (6.10) and the wall bending (6.8) it is easy to check\nthat the second flavor satisfies the last equation in (6.4).\nFinally, let us consider \u03c6b4 in the middle domain near the right edge of the wall,\nz \u2212 z0 \u223c R/2. Substituting (4.14) into the last equation in (6.4) we get the following\nequations for the phase \u03c3:\n\u2202\u03c3\n\u2202\u03c3\n= 1,\n= 0.\n(6.11)\n\u2202\u03b1\n\u2202r\nThe solution to these equations is\n\u03c3 = \u03b1.\n\n(6.12)\n\nIn terms of the dual Abelian gauge field localized on the wall, this solution reflects\nnothing but the unit source charge.\nThe above relation between the vortex solution and the unit source charge calls\nfor a comment. One can identify the compact scalar field \u03c3 with the electric field\nliving on the domain wall world volume via (4.41). Then the result (6.12) gives for\nthis electric field\ne2 xi\n(2+1)\n(6.13)\nF0i\n= 2+1 2 ,\n2\u03c0 r\nwhere the (2+1)-dimensional coupling is given in Eq. (4.40).\nThis is the field of a point-like electric charge in 2+1 dimensions placed at xi = 0.\nThe interpretation of this result is that the string end-point on the wall plays a role\nof the electric charge in the dual U(1) theory on the wall, cf. [4].\n\n6.3\n\nNon-Abelian string ending on the composite wall\n\nNow we pass to the non-Abelian string ending on the composite wall interpolating\nbetween the 12- and 34-vacua. Our strategy is as follows. We start with the (0,1)\nAbelian string as in Sect. 6.2 and consider its junction with the composite 12 \u2192 34\nwall of Sect. 4.3. We then apply the SU(2)C+F rotation introduced and discussed\nin Sect. 5 to this junction. Namely, we write down the first two flavors as a 2 \u00d7 2\nmatrix \u03c6kA (A = 1, 2) and the last two flavors as a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix \u03c6kB (B = 3, 4), and\nrotate them according to\n\u22121\n\u03c6 \u2192 UC+F \u03c6 UC+F\n, flavor indices = 1, 2 ,\n\u22121\n\u03c6 \u2192 UC+F \u03c6 UC+F\n, flavor indices = 3, 4 ,\n\n(6.14)\n\nwith one and the same matrix from SU(2)C+F .\nNote that both the 12- and 34-vacua do not break this symmetry. However, the\nstring and the string-wall junction are not invariant. Therefore, if we apply this\n49\n\n\fFigure 9: Junction of the string and the composite wall. The string pulls out one\nof the components of the composite wall. Arrows show the spread of the magnetic\nflux inside the wall.\nrotation to the solution for the (0,1)-string ending on the composite wall we will get\nthe solution of (6.4) for a non-Abelian string ending on the composite wall, with the\nsame energy.\nHaving set the general strategy, it is time to proceed to a technical analysis of\nthe junction of the (0,1) string with the composite wall. Assume for simplicity that\nin the absence of the string, the matrix \u0168 = I (see Eq. (4.21)) so that the deviation\nof \u0168 from the unit matrix is due to the string flux. Our composite wall can be\nconsidered as a marginally stable bound state of the 12 \u2192 14 and 14 \u2192 34 walls.\nWhile the solution presented in Sect. 4.3 has a vanishing separation between the\nconstituents, the two elementary walls in this bound state do not interact and their\npositions can be shifted to arbitrary separations. As the (0,1)-string can end only\non the 12 \u2192 14 wall, it is clear that it will pick up this wall and pull it out to the\nleft, see Fig. 9. The (14 \u2192 34) constituent stays unbent and does not play a role\nin the junction solution at hand. 18 We see that the solution for the (0,1)-string\nending on the composite wall reduces to the solution for the (0,1)-string ending on\nthe (12 \u2192 14) wall considered in Sect. 6.2.\nThe solution for the (0,1)-string ending on the 12 \u2192 14 wall has the b-component\nof the fourth flavor multiplied by exp (\u2212i\u03c3) with \u03c3 given by (6.12), see Eq. (4.14).\n18\n\nOf course, there could be some interaction of the end point of the string \u221a\non the 12 \u2192 1B wall\nwith 14 \u2192 34 wall but this interaction is short range and dies out at r \u226b 1/ \u03be.\n\n50\n\n\fThe 14 \u2192 34 wall has all phases vanishing because there is no flux going inside this\nwall.\nThus, our junction has the quark matrix of the final vacuum determined by the\nmatrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1 0\n\uf8f8,\n(6.15)\n\u0168 = \uf8ed\n0 e\u2212i\u03b1\n\nsee Eq. (4.21). This shows that the junction of the (0,1)-string and the composite\nwall has the following phase \u03c30 and the SU(2) matrix U (see (4.22)):\n\u03b1\n\u03c30 = \u2212 ,\n2\n\u03c43\nU = exp i \u03b1 .\n2\n!\n\n(6.16)\n\nNow let us apply the SU(2)C+F rotation (6.14) to the whole configuration. The\nflux of the string is now determined by an arbitrary vector na inside the SU(2)\nsubgroup while the quark matrix of the final vacuum gets rotated as\n\uf8eb\n\n\u0168 = UC+F \uf8ed\n\n1\n\n0\n\u2212i\u03b1\n\n0 e\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8 U \u22121\n\nC+F\n\n.\n\n(6.17)\n\nIn terms of the phase \u03c30 and the SU(2) matrix U this amounts to\n\u03b1\n\u03c30 = \u2212 ,\n2\nna \u03c4 a\nU = exp i\n\u03b1 .\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(6.18)\n\nThis result clearly means that the end-point of the string is a point-like source\nof the non-Abelian gauge field on the composite wall. To see this more explicitly let\nus write down the (2+1)-dimensional gauge fields associated with \u03c30 and the matrix\nU using Eq. (4.48). We get\n(2+1)\nF0i\n\na(2+1)\n\nF0i\n\ne22+1 xi\n,\n= \u2212\n4\u03c0 r 2\n=\n\n2\nxi a\ng2+1\nn .\n2\u03c0 r 2\n\n(6.19)\n\nAs we see, this is the field of a classical point-like charge in the SU(2)\u00d7U(1) gauge\ntheory on the wall. The direction of the SU(2) field in the color space is determined\nby the vector na associated with the string flux.\n\n51\n\n\f6.4\n\nGauge symmetry breaking\n\nAs was discussed at the end of Sect. 4.4.2, if our composite wall is split into elementary components whose separation is larger than their thickness, the non-Abelian\ngauge symmetry in the world-volume theory (4.49) is broken down to U(1)\u00d7U(1).\nIn particular, the mass of the (2+1)-dimensional W -bosons becomes proportional\nto the separation l between the elementary walls, see Eq. (4.53).\nOur analysis demonstrates that localization of a gauge field on a wall and existence of the corresponding string-wall junction are two sides of one and the same\nphenomenon. In this section we address the question: \"what happens with the\nstring-wall junction in the (3+1)-dimensional bulk theory if we split the composite\nwall and pull the components apart?\"\nConsider a string-wall junction for the non-Abelian string ending on the composite wall, as in Sect. 6.3. If hli = 0 two elementary walls which form the 12 \u2192 34\nwall overlap at large r (r is the distance from the string end-point along the wall).\nIn fact, the composite 12 \u2192 34 wall can be represented as a bound state of two\nelementary walls in many different ways depending on which particular combination\nof the quark fields is non-zero in the given elementary walls. In particular, the string\nwith flux \u223c na picks up a particular elementary wall with\n\u03c6\n\nkA\n\n\u223c UC+F\n\n1 0\n0 0\n\n!\n\n\u22121\nUC+F\n, A = 1, 2 ,\n\n(6.20)\n\nnon-vanishing inside the wall. The string pulls it out to the left while the \"other\nwall\" is (almost) unbent, see Fig. 9. The string ends on the wall specified by (6.20)\nso the string flux spreads inside this wall, and at large r is given by (6.19). The flux\ndirection in the color space is determined by the string flux vector na .\nNow suppose that hli =\n6 0. In other words, the composite wall is split in particular\nelementary components which do not overlap even at r \u2192 \u221e, see Fig. 10. Say, if we\nhave the 14-vacuum between the walls the elementary wall on the left has a concrete\nnon-vanishing quark field, with necessity, namely, the quark field proportional to\n\u03c6\n\nkA\n\n\u223c\n\n1 0\n0 0\n\n!\n\n, A = 1, 2.\n\n(6.21)\n\nThis guarantees that only the (0,1)-string can end on the wall. The flux inside the\nwall is given in this case by Eq. (6.19) with a specific na , namely, na = (0, 0, 1).\nIf, instead, we have the 23-vacuum between the walls the elementary wall on the\nleft has the non-vanishing quark field proportional to\n\u03c6\n\nkA\n\n\u223c\n\n0 0\n0 1\n\n!\n\n, A = 1, 2.\n\n(6.22)\n\nThis means that only the (1,0)-string can end on this wall configuration. The flux\ninside the wall will be given in this case by Eq. (6.19) with na = (0, 0, \u22121). String\n52\n\n\fFigure 10: Junction of the string and the composite wall for hli =\n6 0.\nwith generic fluxes determined by an arbitrarily-oriented vector na just cannot end\non the composite domain wall if hli > R.\nOf course, this is perfectly consistent with the breaking of the SU(2)\u00d7U(1) gauge\ngroup down to U(1)\u00d7U(1), so that the (2+1)-dimensional W \u00b1 -bosons are heavy, do\nnot propagate, and the massless gauge fields on the wall are by A2+1\nand A3(2+1)\n.\nn\nn\n\n7\n\nDynamics of the world-volume theory\n\nIn this section we briefly discuss dynamics of the world-volume theory emerging\non the wall. We will focus on non-perturbative instanton effects which lead to a\nrun-away vacuum in the world-volume theory.\n\n7.1\n\nBPS saturation of the composite wall\n\nIn Sect. 4.1 we demonstrated that the central charges of the composite wall and\nits two constituents are aligned, so that the tension of the composite wall equals\ntwice the tension of the elementary wall. This statement is valid to any order\nin perturbation theory. If so, the composite wall would be marginally stable: there\nwould be no interaction between the constituent walls no matter what the separation\nbetween the constituents is.\nIn terms of the world-volume theory (4.49) this means that the flat direction\nis not lifted. No superpotential is generated to any finite order in perturbation\ntheory. Phrased this way, the assertion seem almost obvious. From other examples\nwe know, however, that a superpotential might be generated non-perturbatively. An\nindication that this may be the case comes from the occurrence of the anomalous\n\n53\n\n\fterms in the central charge (3.3). Some well-known old results will allow us to answer\nthis question quickly.\n\n7.2\n\nNon-perturbative effects\n\nDynamics of N = 2 (2+1)-dimensional gauge theory with the SU(2) gauge group\nwas studied by Affleck, Harvey and Witten [50]. It was shown that instantons (in\n(2+1) dimensions they are nothing but 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles, tHP for short)\ngenerate a superpotential which produces a run-away vacuum.19 Classically there\nis a flat direction in the theory (4.49) so that the scalar field a32+1 can develop an\narbitrary VEV breaking the SU(2) gauge group on the wall down to U(1). Then\nA1,2(2+1)\nacquire a mass while A2+1\nand A3(2+1)\nremain massless. We can dualize\nn\nn\nn\n3(2+1)\n3\nAn\ninto a compact scalar \u03c3 according to (4.48), to introduce a complex scalar\nfiled \u03a6 = a32+1 + i\u03c3 3 . This scalar is the lowest component of a chiral supermultiplet.\nIt was shown in [50] that instantons-tHP monopoles generate the superpotential 20\n!\n\u03a6\nW2+1 \u223c exp \u2212 2\n.\n(7.1)\ng2+1\nThe potential arising from this superpotential\nV2+1\n\n2a32+1\n\u223c exp \u2212 2\ng2+1\n\n!\n\n(7.2)\n\nleads to a run-away vacuum. Using (4.51) we can reinterpret this potential as a\ninteraction potential between elementary walls which comprise our composite (12 \u2192\n34) wall,\n!\ng2 \u2206m\nVint \u223c exp \u2212\nl .\n(7.3)\ng1 \u03c0\nClassically the elementary walls do not interact. Non-perturbative effects on the\nworld volume induce a repulsive interaction between the elementary walls, so that\nthe BPS bound state can formally appear only in the limit of infinite separation\nbetween walls. However, in fact, the interactions (7.3) become negligibly small\nalready at separations l\u2217 of the order of (\u2206m)\u22121 . In other words, the ratio l\u2217 /R \u223c\n\u03be/(\u2206m)2 \u226a 1. Here R represents the wall thickness.\nWe observe an interesting interplay between bulk physics and physics on the wall.\nIn particular, above we extracted the interaction potential between the elementary\nwalls from the known results on the effective theory on the wall. This bulk/brane\n19\n\nHistorically this work presented the first example ever in which perturbative non-renormalization theorem \u2013 the absence of the superpotential \u2013 was shown to be violated non-perturbatively.\n20\nThe mechanism is quite similar to the one in the non-supersymmetric version of the theory\nstudied by Polyakov [36]. Monopoles form a Coulomb gas in (2+1) dimensions which is equivalent\nto the sine-Gordon theory.\n\n54\n\n\fduality is somewhat similar to the AdS/CFT correspondence. A weak coupling\nregime in the bulk maps onto a strong coupling regime on the wall and vice versa.\nTo see that this is indeed the case, suffice it to remember that when the bulk\ncoupling constants g12 and g22 are small the (2+1)-dimensional couplings (4.52) are\nlarge compared to the characteristic scale of massive excitations on the wall which\nare of the order of 1/R\u0303 (cf. [4]).\n\n7.3\n\nCompatibility with the D-brane picture\n\nReturning to the issue of the elementary wall exponential repulsion, one may ask how\nthis can be interpreted in view of the well-known fact that the two-stacks (as well\nas all other stacks) of D-branes are stable. The answer is quite clear. D-branes have\nno thickness. Our construction belongs to weak coupling where the walls do have\na thickness. The repulsive non-perturbative interaction dies off at distances much\nless than the wall thickness. Therefore, squeezing the walls to vanishing thickness\nautomatically switches the repulsion off.\n\n8\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we studied localization of non-Abelian gauge fields on domain walls.\nWe showed that although elementary domain walls can localize only Abelian fields\nthe composite domain wall does localize non-Abelian gauge fields. In order to have\nthis localization we considered N = 2 QCD with the gauge group SU(2)\u00d7U(1) in\na special regime. Although the gauge group is completely Higgsed by the quark\nVEV's in the bulk it is restored inside the composite domain wall where all quark\nfields are almost zero. This ensures localization of the non-Abelian gauge field on\nthe wall.\nAnother side of this phenomenon is the possibility for non-Abelian flux tubes to\nend on the wall. The non-Abelian flux tubes were recently found in Ref. [6] in four\ndimensions and in Ref. [5] in three dimensions. They carry additional orientational\nzero modes corresponding to rotations of the color-magnetic flux inside the SU(2)\nsubgroup of the gauge group. The key ingredient for the existence of such nonAbelian strings is the presence of a diagonal color-flavor group SU(2)C+F unbroken\nby the vacuum condensates (color-flavor locking). We found a 1/4-BPS solution for\nsuch non-Abelian string ending on the composite wall. The end point of the string\nplays the role of a color charge in the (2+1)-dimensional (dual) non-Abelian gauge\ntheory on the wall.\nTo study the string-wall junctions we use the first-order master equations (6.4)\nwhich in the Abelian case were derived in [4]. In fact, the same equations can be\nused for all possible junctions between domain walls, strings and monopoles. In\nparticular, recently they were used [7] to study the (1, \u22121) monopole as a junction\nof the (1,0) and (0,1) strings in the limit of large \u2206m. We discuss this monopole\n55\n\n\fin the opposite limit of equal quark masses, \u2206m \u2192 0, when it becomes a junction\nof two strings associated with two quantum vacua of the (1+1)-dimensional O(3)\nsigma model on the string world sheet. We show that the mass of this monopole is\nlifted from zero by non-perturbative effects in the O(3) sigma model. We will come\nback to this issue [32].\nWe also studied the effective (2+1)-dimensional non-Abelian theory on the composite domain wall. We found an interesting bulk/brane duality. In particular, the\nweak coupling regime in the bulk maps onto the strong coupling regime on the wall\nand vice versa. This is quite similar in spirit to the Ads/CFT correspondence.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to A. Gorsky, Adam Ritz and Arkady Vainshtein for discussions. The\nwork of M.
