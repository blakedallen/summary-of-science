For solutions to Dirac type equations on Riemannian manifolds there\nexists a number of methods to show the weak unique continuation property for solutions,\ni. e. a solution vanishing on a non-void open set vanishes identically ([4]).\nThe relativistic quantum theory of a single electron is described by the Hilbert space of\n4-component spinors H := L2 (R3 , C4 ) and the Dirac operator H0 for mass m > 0,\nwhich is essentially self-adjoint on the dense subspace Cc\u221e (R3 , C4 ). If P+ and P\u2212 are the\northogonal projections onto the spectral subspaces for the positive and negative part of the\nspectrum of the Dirac operator, the physical state space of the theory is the space of rays in\nthe Hilbert space H+ := P+ H. The time evolution is given by the unitary group generated\n1\n\n\fby the Dirac operator restricted to\nH+ . For such a physical state \u03c8 \u2208 H+ , k\u03c8k = 1, and\nR\n3\nany region O \u2282 R the integral O h\u03c8(x), \u03c8(x)id3 x is the probability to find the electron\nin O. It is known for the case of the free Dirac operator that functions in H+ have the\nweak unique continuation property, see [13, Corollary 1.7]. Physically this means, that\none cannot localize a single electron in a bounded region. In the fully quantized theory\nof the electron field this property has important consequences. The reason for this is\nthat the quantization procedure requires the splitting of H into a direct sum H+ \u2295 H\u2212 ,\nsee [13, Section 10.1] for details. The weak continuation property implies however that\nP+ Cc\u221e (O, C4 ) is already dense in H+ for any non-void open set O \u2282 R3 . Hence the local\ninformation is destroyed by the splitting. As a consequence the vacuum vector turns out\nto be cyclic for the local field algebras. This Reeh-Schlieder property of the vacuum is a\ngeneral property of quantum field theories in Minkowski space-time and can be proved in\nthe Wightman framework even for interacting fields ([9]).\nReplacing R3 by an arbitrary Riemannian manifold (M, g) it is natural to ask whether\nthe weak unique continuation property still holds not only for solutions to Dirac type\nequations but also, as in the case of R3 , for elements of certain spectral subspaces. In\nthis note we will prove that such a property holds for a large class of generalized Dirac\noperators on an arbitrary connected Riemannian manifold. The physical interpretation is\nthat single electrons cannot be localized even in curved space and the corresponding Dirac\nquantum field has the Reeh-Schlieder property. Our class of operators is large enough to\nallow coupling to arbitrary smooth Hermitian potentials. Note that in this situation only\nthe space is curved which in a relativistic framework would correspond to an ultrastatic\nspace-time, i. e. the space-time of the form R \u00d7 M with metric tensor dt2 \u2212 g. There\nalready exist results on the Reeh-Schlieder property for the free scalar field over such\nspace-times ([14]) and recently also for quite general free quantum fields over spacetimes admitting a time-like Killing vector field ([12]). See also [10] for the connection\nof unique continuation theorems with the Reeh-Schlieder property within non-relativistic\nquantum mechanics.\nThe weak unique continuation property for elements of spectral subspaces provides a particularly straightforward way to understand the localization problem for single particles\nand the Reeh-Schlieder property for the corresponding quantum fields over ultrastatic\nspace-times. Independently such theorems play an important role in Riemannian geometry since splittings of the type H = H+ \u2295 H\u2212 also occur in an essential manner in\nboundary value problems for Dirac equations ([2]). This note can be considered a continuation of [3] since we are now able to remove the assumption in [3] that the underlying\nmanifold be compact.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nNotation and Result\n\nLet (M, g) be a Riemannian manifold, let E \u2192 M be a Hermitian vector bundle over\nM. Denote the Hermitian metric on E by h*, *i. The space of smooth sections in E will\nbe denoted C \u221e (M, E) and similar notation will be used for compactly supported smooth\nsections and for square-integrable sections. Let\nD : C \u221e (M, E) \u2192 C \u221e (M, E)\nbe a formally self-adjoint differential operator of first order. We call D of Dirac type if its\nprincipal symbol \u03c3D satisfies the Clifford relations, i. e.\n\u03c3D (\u03be) \u25e6 \u03c3D (\u03b7) + \u03c3D (\u03b7) \u25e6 \u03c3D (\u03be) = \u22122g(\u03be, \u03b7) * IdEp\nfor all \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 Tp\u2217 M, p \u2208 M. Then D is an elliptic differential operator of first order.\nExample 1 Let M = S 1 be the circle and let E be the trivial complex line bundle over\nM. Then D = i dtd is of Dirac type. Fourier expansion of complex valued functions is\nnothing but the eigenvector expansion for D.\nExample 2 More generally, any generalized Dirac operator in the sense of Gromov and\nLawson ([7]) is of Dirac type.\nExample 3 Let M = R3 and let D be the Dirac operator in an external field, D = H =\nH0 + V in the terminology of [13, Section 4]. Here the potential V to be added to the\nfree Dirac operator H0 may be any smooth function V with values in Hermitian matrices.\nExamples include electromagnetic vector potentials, and electric and magnetic anomalous\nmoments.\nExample 4 Since the underlying manifold M need not necessarily be complete we can\nalso deal with singular potentials. Let us demonstrate this for the Coulomb potential. Put\n\u03b3\nId, and D = H = H0 + V as in the previous example. It\nM = R3 \u2212 {0}, V (x) := |x|\nis known ([13, Section 4]) that if the coupling constant \u03b3 is not too large, |\u03b3| < const,\nthen D is essentially self-adjoint on Cc\u221e (M, C4 ). But even for larger coupling constant\nfor which essential self-adjointness is known to break down there still exist self-adjoint\nextensions and our theorem can be applied.\nExample 5 Let (M, g), E, and D be as above with D of Dirac type. Put X := M \u00d7 R\nwith Riemannian metric ds2 = g + dt2 where t is the standard coordinate on R. Hence\nX is the cylinder over M. The pull-back of E to X is again denoted by E. Define the\nHermitian vector bundle E := E \u2295 E over X. Then\nD :=\n\n\u0012\n\nD\n\u2202\n\u2212 \u2202t\n\nacting on sections in E is of Dirac type over X.\n3\n\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\n\u2212D\n\n\u0013\n\n\fNow let D be of Dirac type over the connected Riemannian manifold M. Let \u03c6 be in\nthe kernel of D. By elliptic regularity theory \u03c6 is necessarily smooth. It is well-known\nthat D has the unique continuation property meaning that if \u03c6 vanishes on a non-empty\nopen subset O \u2282 M, then \u03c6 vanishes everywhere, see e. g. [4, 5]. Of course this is also\ntrue for eigensections of D to other eigenvalues \u03bb 6= 0 since one can simply replace D by\nD \u2212 \u03bb Id. This unique continuation property of Dirac type operators can also be shown by\npassing to the square of D and applying the classical Aronszajn theorem ([1]) for Laplace\ntype operators.\nWe show here that the assumption D\u03c6 = 0 can be relaxed considerably. Roughly speaking, it is enough that \u03c6 lies in a D-invariant subspace of the Hilbert space of squareintegrable sections L2 (M, E) on which D is semibounded.\nFor a subset S \u2282 R denote the characteristic function by \u03c7S ,\n\u03c7S (\u03bb) =\n\n(\n\n1, \u03bb \u2208 S\n0, \u03bb \u2208 R \u2212 S.\n\nOur main result is\nTheorem Let M be a connected Riemannian manifold , let E be a Hermitian vector\nbundle over M, and let D be of Dirac type acting on Cc\u221e (M, E). Suppose D has a selfadjoint extension in L2 (M, E) which we denote by A. Let O \u2282 M be a non-empty open\nsubset of M. Let \u03c6 \u2208 L2 (M, E) such that there exists \u03bb0 \u2208 R with \u03c7[\u03bb0 ,\u221e) (A)\u03c6 = 0 or\n\u03c7(\u2212\u221e,\u03bb0 ] (A)\u03c6 = 0.\nThen the following conclusion holds:\n\u03c6|O = 0 \u21d2 \u03c6 = 0 on all of M.\n\nExample 6 If \u03c6 is a square-integrable eigensection for D, then clearly, \u03c7[\u03bb0 ,\u221e) (A)\u03c6 = 0\nfor any \u03bb0 larger than the eigenvalue and we recover the classical unique continuation\nproperty of D mentioned above.\nExample 7 In case M = S 1 and D = i dtd we may apply the theorem to all \u03c6 \u2208 L2 (S 1 , C)\nwhose Fourier coefficients cn vanish for all n smaller than some n0 , i. e. all \u03c6 of the form\n\u03c6(t) =\n\nX\n\ncn eint .\n\nn\u2265n0\n\nThe theorem says that any such \u03c6 must be identically zero if it vanishes on a non-empty\nopen subset of S 1 .\nExample 8 More generally, if M is compact and connected , then the spectrum of A\nis discrete. We may split L2 (M, E) = H\u22640 \u2295 H>0 where H\u22640 denotes the sum of all\n4\n\n\feigenspaces for the non-positive eigenvalues and similarly H>0 corresponds to the positive eigenvalues. This splitting is important to define the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary\nconditions for boundary value problems for Dirac operators ([2]). By the theorem no\nnon-trivial \u03c6 \u2208 H\u22640 or \u03c6 \u2208 H>0 can vanish on a non-empty open subset of M.\nRemark Note that in the theorem no assumption of essential self-adjointness of D on\nCc\u221e (M, E) is made. Dirac type operators on a complete manifold are always essentially\nself-adjoint on smooth compactly supported sections. The well-known proofs of this fact\nfor generalized Dirac operators in sense of Gromov and Lawson ([7]) easily carry over\nto our more general class of operators, see also [6] for a different approach. However,\nwe only need existence of self-adjoint extensions not their uniqueness. Hence in our case\nthe manifold M need not necessarily be complete, compare Example 4. Also see [8] for\nexamples with cone singularities to which our theorem can be applied.\nIt should also be emphasized that \u03c6 need not lie in the domain of definition of D or of A.\nOnly square-integrability and \u03c7[\u03bb0 ,\u221e)(A)\u03c6 = 0 or \u03c7(\u2212\u221e,\u03bb0 ] (A)\u03c6 = 0 are assumed.\nAlso note that our theorem shows that the spectrum of any Dirac type operator is indeed\nunbounded from above and from below. Otherwise, every section in L2 (M, E) would\nhave the unique continuation property which is absurd.\n\n3\n\nThe Proof\n\nIn this section we give the proof of the theorem. We keep the notation of the theorem and\nwe assume \u03c6|O = 0. We wish to show \u03c6 = 0.\nWithout loss of generality we may assume that \u03bb0 = 1 and that \u03c7(\u2212\u221e,1] (A)\u03c6 = 0. In\nother words, \u03c6 lies in the image of the projection \u03c7(1,\u221e) (A). Denote the upper half plane\nby\nH := {\u03b6 \u2208 C | I(\u03b6) > 0}.\nStep 1: The family of functions fz ,\nfz (\u03bb) =\n\n(\n\n\u03bb\u22121 eiz\u03bb , \u03bb \u2265 1\n,\n0,\n\u03bb<1\n\nis uniformly bounded by 1 for all z \u2208 H\u0304 and for each fixed \u03bb it is continuous in z.\nTherefore the family of bounded operators fz (A) is continuous in z \u2208 H\u0304 in the strong\noperator topology. Hence z 7\u2192 fz (A)\u03c6 is a continuous L2 (M, E)-valued function on H\u0304.\nNow fix z0 \u2208 H. The family of functions gz defined by\ngz (\u03bb) :=\n\n(\n\niz\u03bb\n\niz \u03bb\n\n\u2212e 0\n\u03bb\u22121 e z\u2212z\n, z=\n6 z0\n0\niz0 \u03bb\nie ,\nz = z0\n\n5\n\n\ffor \u03bb \u2265 1 and gz (\u03bb) = 0 for \u03bb < 1 is also uniformly bounded and continuous in z. This\nshows\nfz (A)\u03c6 \u2212 fz0 (A)\u03c6\nlim\nz\u2192z0\nz \u2212 z0\nexists and hence z 7\u2192 fz (A)\u03c6 is holomorphic on H.\nStep 2: Fix a non-empty relatively compact open subset \u00d5 \u2282\u2282 O. Let u \u2208 Cc\u221e (M, E)\nwith support contained in \u00d5. By finiteness of propagation speed, see Section 4, there\nexists \u03b5 > 0 such that the support of eitA u is contained in O for all t \u2208 [\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5]. Hence for\nall t with |t| \u2264 \u03b5 we have\n(\u03c6, e\u2212itA u)\n(eitA \u03c6, u)\n(Aft (A)\u03c6, u)\n(ft (A)\u03c6, Au).\n\n0 =\n=\n=\n=\n\nHere we used that by assumption \u03c6 lies in the image of the projection \u03c7(1,\u221e) (A) and hence\neizA \u03c6 = Afz (A)\u03c6. Since z 7\u2192 (fz (A)\u03c6, Au) is continuous on H\u0304 and holomorphic on H\nand vanishes on [\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5] an application of the Schwarz reflection principle ([3, Lemma 2])\nshows\n(fz (A)\u03c6, Au) = 0\nfor all z \u2208 H\u0304. In particular for z = it with t > 0 we obtain\n(e\u2212tA \u03c6, u) = (fit (A)\u03c6, Au) = 0\nfor all u \u2208 Cc\u221e (M, E) with support contained in \u00d5. Hence e\u2212tA \u03c6 vanishes on \u00d5 for all\nt > 0.\nStep 3: Now look at the half cylinder X = M \u00d7 (0, \u221e) with product metric g + dt2 ,\nHermitian vector bundle E := E \u2295 E over X, and Dirac type operator\nD :=\n\n\u0012\n\nD\n\u2202\n\u2212 \u2202t\n\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\n\u2212D\n\n\u0013\n\nas in Example 5. We define a distributional section \u03a61 in E over X by\n\u03a61 (v) :=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n(e\u2212tA \u03c6, v(*, t))L2 (M,E) dt\n\nfor all v \u2208 Cc\u221e (X, E). The differential equation\nd \u2212tA\ne \u03c6 = \u2212Ae\u2212tA \u03c6\ndt\nshows that the distributional section\n\u03a6 :=\n\n\u0012\n\n6\n\n\u03a61\n\u03a61\n\n\u0013\n\n\fin E satisfies\nD\u03a6 = 0\nin the distributional sense. In particular, \u03a6 is smooth by elliptic regularity theory.\nSince \u03a6 vanishes on the open subset \u00d5 \u00d7 (0, \u221e) of X the standard unique continuation\nproperty of D implies \u03a6 = 0. Hence \u03a61 = 0, i. e. e\u2212tA \u03c6 = 0 for all t > 0, and the limit\nt \u0581 0 yields \u03c6 = 0.\n\u2737\n\n4\n\nFinite Propagation Speed\n\nIn the second step of the proof we needed what is known as \"finite propagation speed\" for\npossibly incomplete manifolds. For the sake of completeness we give a justification for\nthis by reducing it to the compact case. A direct approach can be found in [6].\nFor any closed subset A of M let Ur (A) be the closed r-neighborhood of A, i. e.\nUr (A) = {x \u2208 M | dist(x, A) \u2264 r}.\nProposition Let M be a Riemannian manifold, let E be a Hermitian vector bundle over\nM, and let D be of Dirac type acting on Cc\u221e (M, E). Suppose D has a self-adjoint\nextension in L2 (M, E) which we denote A. Let \u03c6 \u2208 Cc\u221e (M, E).\nThen there exists \u03b5 > 0 such that for all t \u2208 [0, \u03b5)\n\u03c6t := eitA \u03c6\nis smooth in all variables and\nsupp(\u03c6t ) \u2282 Ut (supp(\u03c6)).\nIf M is complete, then the statement is true for \u03b5 = \u221e.\nProof. The proposition is well-known if the underlying manifold is compact, see e. g. [11,\nProp. 5.5] for a proof. By assumption supp(\u03c6) is compact. Hence there exists \u03b5 > 0\nsuch that U\u03b5 (supp(\u03c6)) is still compact. We pick a compact manifold Y containing an\nisometric image of U\u03b5 (supp(\u03c6)) together with a Hermitian bundle and Dirac type operator\nextending E and D over U\u03b5 (supp(\u03c6)). (This can e. g. be obtained by choosing an open\nsubset X \u2282 M containing U\u03b5 (supp(\u03c6)) with compact closure X\u0304 and smooth boundary\n\u2202X. Then let Y be the double of X and smooth out all data along \u2202X.) Since \u03c6 has\nsupport contained in U\u03b5 (supp(\u03c6)) we can consider it as a section over Y by extending it\nby 0. Let \u03c6t denote the solution of\n\u2202\n\u03c6t = iD\u03c6t\n\u2202t\n7\n\n\fover Y with \u03c60 = \u03c6. Then \u03c6t is smooth in all variables and has support contained in\nU\u03b5 (supp(\u03c6)) for t \u2208 [0, \u03b5). By this last property we can consider \u03c6t as a smooth section\nover M, again extending by zero. Considered as elements of L2 (M, E) we have\nd\n\u03c6t = iD\u03c6t = iA\u03c6t\ndt\nand hence \u03c6t = eitA \u03c6.\nIn case M is complete \u03b5 can be chosen arbitrarily large.\n\n5\n\n\u2737\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nOur main argument makes use of the unique continuation theorem for solutions to Dirac\ntype equations on Riemannian manifolds (on the half cylinder X). In order to use this\ntheorem we had to analytically continue the functions t 7\u2192 (ft (A)\u03c6, Au) (see Step 2 in the\nproof) to \"imaginary time\". This was possible due to semi-boundedness of the spectrum\nof the Dirac operator on the spectral subspaces under consideration. In quantum field\ntheory this method is commonly referred to as \"Wick rotation\".\nIt should be noted that our theorem can be extended to even more general subspaces.\nClearly analyticity of the function (fz (A)\u03c6, Au) in the whole upper half plane is not\nnecessary, but it suffices to have boundedness and analyticity in a strip of the form {\u03b6 \u2208\nC | 0 < I(\u03b6) < \u03b2} for some \u03b2 > 0. Such subspaces arise naturally in thermal quantum\nfield theory.\n\nReferences\n[1] N.
