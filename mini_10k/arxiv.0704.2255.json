INTRODUCTION\n\nThe neutron star 1E 1207.4\u22125209 in the center of supernova remnant PKS 1209\u221251/52 is the first discovered\n(Helfand & Becker 1984) and most intensively studied of\nthe so-called Central Compact Objects (CCOs). These\nseemingly isolated NSs are defined by their steady flux,\npredominantly thermal X-ray emission, lack of optical or\nradio counterparts, and absence of a surrounding pulsar wind nebula (see Pavlov et al. 2004, for a review).\n1E 1207.4\u22125209 acquired special importance when it became the first CCO in which pulsations were detected\n(Zavlin et al. 2000; Pavlov et al. 2002). It was distinguished again as the first isolated NS to display strong\nabsorption lines in its X-ray spectrum (Sanwal et al.\n2002; Mereghetti et al. 2002; Bignami et al. 2003).\nMore recently, accumulated X-ray observations of\n1E 1207.4\u22125209 were presented as showing largeamplitude changes of both sign in its spin period (Zavlin\net al. 2004) that were unlike any other pulsar and difficult\nto explain. Consequently, the surface dipole magnetic\nfield, which is a key parameter in all proposed mechanisms for the X-ray absorption lines, could not be estimated independently from the spin-down rate, which\nwas indeterminate. In this Letter, we present a definitive study of the spin history of 1E 1207.4\u22125209 that\ncorrects previous errors in the data and their analysis.\nWe provide reliable spin parameters and discuss their implications for the interpretation of the X-ray spectrum of\n1E 1207.4\u22125209, and for the origin of the class of CCOs\nmore generally.\n2. ARCHIVAL X-RAY OBSERVATIONS (2000\u20132005)\n\nWe reanalyzed all timing data on 1E 1207.4\u22125209 from\nthe archives of the Newton X-Ray Multi-Mirror Mission\n(XMM-Newton) and Chandra observatories. They span\n2000 January to 2005 July. A log of these observations\nis given in Table 1.\n\nAll 11 XMM-Newton observations of 1E 1207.4\u22125209\nused the pn detector of the European Photon Imaging\nCamera (EPIC-pn) in \"small window\" (SW) mode to\nachieve 5.7 ms time resolution. Several EPIC-pn data\nsets had photon timing errors uncorrected in their original processing (Kirsch et al. 2004). We reprocessed\nall EPIC data using the emchain and epchain scripts\nunder Science Analysis System (SAS) version xmmsas 20060628 1801-7.0.0, which produces correct photon\ntime assignments. The observations were affected by\nbackground to varying degree. To maximize the signalto-noise ratio in each, we adjusted the source extraction\naperture individually. For this soft source, an energy cut\nof 0.5 \u2212 2.5 keV was found to maximize pulsed power.\nWe also examined data simultaneously available from\nthe EPIC MOS camera, operated in \"full frame\" mode.\nAlthough not useful for timing purposes (2.7 s readout),\nthe location of the source at the center of the on-axis\nMOS CCD allows a better background measurement to\ntest for flux variability, an important indicator of accretion, than the EPIC-pn SW mode. The seven observations of 2005 exhibit root-mean-square source flux variability of less than 1% over the 40 day span. Comparing\nthese count rates to the earlier XMM-Newton observation of 2001 December, implies a marginally significant\nflux decrease of 5% \u00b1 3% during the 5 year interval.\nFour Chandra observations suitable for timing measurements of 1E 1207.4\u22125209 are available. They used\nthe Advanced Camera for Imaging and Spectroscopy\n(ACIS) in continuous-clocking (CC) mode to provide\ntime resolution of 2.85 ms. Two of the four observations were taken with the LETG transmission grating in\nplace, the zeroth order image being used for timing. This\nstudy uses data processed by the latest pipeline software\n(revision v7.6.8.1), with the exception of 2000 January\n6, which is processed with revision v6.5.1.

Uncertainty in last digits is in parenthesis, which is 1\u03c3 computed by the Monte Carlo\n1\nmethod described in Gotthelf et al. (1999).\nb These Chandra observations used the low-energy transmission grating (LETG).\n\n(v3.4) and CALDB (v3.3). The photon arrival times in\nCC mode are adjusted in the standard processing to account for the known position of the pulsar, spacecraft\ndither, and SIM offset. These needed corrections were a\npotential cause of timing errors in earlier work, but are\nnow accurately performed.\n3. TIMING ANALYSIS\n\nFor each observation in Table 1 we transformed the\nphoton arrival times from 1E 1207.4\u22125209 to Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) using the coordinates given\nin Table 2, and identified the pulsed signal using a standard FFT. To obtain a most precise value of the period\nin each observation we then generated a periodogram\nusing a Z12 test (Buccheri et al. 1983) around the FFT\nvalue. The 1\u03c3 uncertainty in P was determined by the\nMonte-Carlo method described in Gotthelf et al. (1999).\nIn contrast to the large period changes claimed by Zavlin et al. (2004), a linear ephemeris is an excellent fit to\nour derived periods (see Fig. 1), with \u03c72\u03bd = 0.65 for 12\ndegrees-of-freedom, and no significant detection of a period derivative. The average period throughout the data\nspan is P = 424.130801(57) ms, with a formal 2\u03c3 upper\nlimit of \u1e56 < 3.9 \u00d7 10\u221215 s s\u22121 .\nIn order to increase the precision, we refitted closely\nspaced observations coherently wherever possible. The\nresults for these combined data are listed by set in Table 1, and the methods are described here. The 2005\nJune-July set of seven observations spanned 40 days\nspecifically to obtain a phase-coherent timing solution.\nWoods et al. (2006) were not able to eliminate large phase\nresiduals between these observations or find a unique solution. We determined that the original data processing\nhad timing errors.\nUsing the reprocessed data, we iteratively measured\nthe period and phase of adjacent observations of the 2005\ndata by the Z12 method. Starting with the the longest observation of 2005 July 11, we extrapolated the resulting\n\nperiod to the flanking observations, verifying that the\npredicted phase and its uncertainty matched to < 0.1\ncycles the actual phase derived from the adjacent observations. After completing this procedure for all the 2005\nobservations a coherent fit was obtained for the entire\nset. Figure 2 shows the phase residuals of the individual\nobservations from the best fit, which demonstrates the\nvalidity of the solution. The best-fit period has Z12 = 412\nand agrees with the period found above from the incoherent analysis of all observations, while the next highest\npeak in the power spectrum has Z12 = 275 and is clearly\nan alias. To test for a \u1e56 , we then performed a Z12 search\non a two-dimensional grid of P and \u1e56 . The extra parameter did not increase the peak Z12 significantly, meaning\nno detection of \u1e56 .\n\nFig. 1.- Period residuals after fitting a linear solution to individual observations (top panel) and grouped data sets (bottom panel)\nfrom Table 1.

Now knowing the precise and consistent\nvalues of P in 2002 and 2005, we were able to make\na phase-connected combination of the 2001 December\nXMM-Newton observation and the 2002 January Chandra one, which are 13 days apart, by finding an exact\nperiod match for the correct peak from among nearby\naliases. Finally, we combined the set of two Chandra observations spanning 2003 June 10\u201319, which again\nyielded a consistent period at the highest peak in the Z12\nperiodogram. After making these coherent combinations,\nit was not possible to achieve a further phase-connected\nsolution over a longer time span, as the intervening cycle counts could not be determined uniquely. Therefore,\nwe made a final linear least-squares fit to the five points\nlisted in Table 1, yielding the ephemeris presented in Table 2. This piecewise coherent measurement, yielding a\n2\u03c3 upper limit of \u1e56 < 2.8 \u00d7 10\u221216 , is more than an order of magnitude more precise than the fully incoherent\nanalysis (see Fig. 1).\n\nFig. 2.- Pulse phase residuals for the 2005 XMM-Newton observations of 1E 1207.4\u22125209 after fitting a coherent timing solution\nusing a constant period model, yielding P = 424.1307512(40) ms.\n\n4. INTERPRETATION\n\nContrary to previous claims, the timing behavior of\n1E 1207.4\u22125209 does not require glitches, a binary companion, and perhaps not even accretion of fallback material, although the latter may still be needed to contribute\nto its X-ray spectrum and luminosity. The absence of detectable spin variations is due to a weak dipole magnetic\nfield. In the dipole spin-down formalism, the 2\u03c3 upper\nlimit on \u1e56 implies, for an isolated pulsar, an energy loss\n\n3\n\n\u22121\nrate \u0116 = \u2212I\u03a9\u03a9\u0307 = 4\u03c0 2 I \u1e56 /P 3 < 1.5 \u00d7 1032 ergs\np s ,\n19\nsurface magnetic field strength Bp = 3.2 \u00d7 10\nP \u1e56 <\n3.5\u00d71011 G, and characteristic age \u03c4c \u2261 P/2\u1e56 > 24 Myr.\nIn its spin properties, 1E 1207.4\u22125209 is nearly a twin\nof another CCO, PSR J1852+0040 (Gotthelf et al. 2005;\nHalpern et al. 2007). The next section closely follows the\ndiscussion in Halpern et al. (2007), which anticipated the\npresent result.\n\n4.1. Cooling and/or Accreting\nThe X-ray luminosity of 1E 1207.4\u22125209 is of thermal\norigin, with Lbol \u2248 2 \u00d7 1033 (d/2 kpc)2 ergs s\u22121 (De Luca\net al. 2004). This is much larger than the upper limit\non its spin-down power, \u0116, and argues that it is mostly\nresidual cooling. However, fits to the spectrum require\ntwo blackbody components; the hotter one, of temperature kTBB = 0.32 keV, has an area of only 0.87 km2\n(De Luca et al. 2004), which may indicate heating by\naccretion onto the polar cap. The canonical area of the\nopen-field-line polar cap is Rpc = 2\u03c0 2 R3 /P c \u2248 0.27 km2 .\nThis is \u223c 30% of the fitted blackbody component, but\naccretion may cover a wider area.\nThe characteristic age \u03c4c > 24 Myr, compared to the\nremnant age, estimated as 7 kyr with an uncertainty of\na factor of 3 (Roger et al. 1988), requires that pulsar was\nborn spinning at its current period. A recent population analysis of radio pulsars favors a wide distribution of\nbirth periods (Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re & Kaspi 2006), in which\n424 ms would be typical. Furthermore, as magnetic\nfield is generated by a turbulent dynamo whose strength\ndepends on the rotation rate of the proto-neutron star\n(Thompson & Duncan 1993), it is natural that pulsars\nborn spinning slowly would have the weaker B-fields; the\nmodel of Bonanno et al. (2006) supports this.\nThere are no young radio pulsars with Bp < 1011 G.\nSince 1E 1207.4\u22125209 is not necessarily beyond the radio pulsar death line, either empirical (Faucher-Gigu\u00e8re\n& Kaspi 2006) or theoretical (Chen & Ruderman 1993),\nthere may be another reason it is radio quiet. It is\npossible that low-level accretion of SN debris prevents\nCCOs from becoming radio pulsars for thousands or even\nmillions of years. Accretion from a fallback disk (Alpar 2001; Shi & Xu 2003; Ek\u015fi et al. 2005; Liu et al.\n2006) was one of the theories considered by Zavlin et al.\n(2004) to explain the now defunct timing irregularities\nof 1E 1207.4\u22125209. But accretion may still be needed to\naccount for its radio-quiet and X-ray-hot properties.\nIf the magnetic field is weak enough that an accretion\ndisk can penetrate the light cylinder, the hotter portion\nof the NS surface in 1E 1207.4\u22125209 can be powered\nby accretion of only \u1e41 \u2248 1013 g s\u22121 . It is required that\nBp < 5\u00d71011 G for 1E 1207.4\u22125209 to be able to accrete\nin the propeller regime. But in this limit, the pulsar\nwould tend to spin down at a rate that is excluded by\nobservations,\n\u0013\n\u0013\u22122/7\n\u0012\n\u0012\nP\nM\n3/7\n\u22121\n\u221214 8/7\nI45\n,\n\u1e56 \u2248 1.2 \u00d7 10\n\u03bc29 \u1e4013\nM\u2299\n0.424 s\nwhere the magnetic moment \u03bc = Bp R3 /2 \u2248 1029 Bp,11\nG cm3 . Also, \u1e40 would have to be greater than 1013\ng s\u22121 , as most of the accreting matter is expelled from\nthe magnetospheric radius rather than accreted.\n\n\f4\n\nGotthelf & Halpern\n\nHowever, if Bp < 2 \u00d7 109 G, then 1E 1207.4\u22125209 may\naccrete as a \"slow rotator,\" and spin up at a small rate,\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u00133/7 \u0012\nM\nP\n6/7\n\u221217 2/7\n\u1e56 \u2248 \u22122.1 \u00d7 10\n\u03bc27 \u1e4113\n.\nM\u2299\n0.424 s\nIn this regime, secular spin-up, and torque noise, which\nmay be of the same magnitude, are below the sensitivity\nof the existing measurements.\nWhile flickering is also an indicator of accretion, we do\nnot have strong evidence of variability of 1E 1207.4\u22125209\n(< 1% on month timescales). Also, upper limits on optical/IR emission from 1E 1207.4\u22125209 are comparable to\nthat expected from a geometrically thin, optically thick\ndisk accreting at the rate required to account for its Xray luminosity (Zavlin et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2007).\nTherefore, it may be necessary to invoke a radiatively\ninefficient flow in order to consider accretion.\n\nEddington-limited accretion rates, the spin-up and spindown time scales in \u00a73.1 and in Halpern et al. (2007) are\nmuch longer than the ages of the remnants. While we\ndo not have definite evidence of accretion in any CCO,\nsmall Bp and large P both make it possible for a pulsar\nto accrete at low rates from a SN debris disk; the large\nBp and rapid spin of young radio pulsars prevents such\na disk from penetrating the light cylinder. In order to\ntest the general applicability of these results to the class\nof CCOs, more sensitives searches for their pulsations\nare required. However, prior null results on all of them\nsuggest that their pulsed amplitudes are very small.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\n4.2. X-ray Absorption Lines\nBroad absorption lines in the soft X-ray spectrum of\n1E 1207.4\u22125209 are centered at 0.7 keV and 1.4 keV\n(Sanwal et al. 2002; Mereghetti et al. 2002), and possibly\nat 2.1 keV and 2.8 keV (Bignami et al. 2003; De Luca et\nal. 2004), although the reality of the two higher-energy\nfeatures has been disputed (Mori et al. 2005). Proposed\nabsorption mechanisms include electron cyclotron in a\nweak (8 \u00d7 1010 G) magnetic field (Bignami et al. 2003;\nDe Luca et al. 2004), atomic features from singly ionized\nhelium in a strong (2 \u00d7 1014 G) field (Sanwal et al. 2002;\nPavlov & Bezchastnov 2005), and iron (Mereghetti et al.\n2002), or oxygen/neon in a normal (1012 G) field (Hailey\n& Mori 2002; Mori & Hailey 2006).\nOur upper limit, Bp < 3.5 \u00d7 1011 G, favors the electron\ncyclotron model, for at least one of the lines, over all others that require stronger fields. The cyclotron prediction,\n8 \u00d7 1010 G, assumes that 0.7 keV is the fundamental energy Ec = 1.16(B/1011 G)/(1+z), where z is the gravitational redshift. Another solution postulates hydrogenic\noxygen for the 0.7 keV kine, while the 1.4 keV line is\nthe cyclotron fundamental (Hailey & Mori 2002; Mori &\nHailey 2006). As these authors pointed out, abundant\noxygen may be accreted from supernova debris. One\ncaveat, however, is that the magnetic field strength at\nthe NS surface can be larger in places than the global\ndipole that determines the spin-down rate.\n\nA comprehensive analysis of all timing data on the Xray pulsar 1E 1207.4\u22125209 has resolved the dilemma of\nits mysterious spin properties by correcting previous errors in data processing and analysis. It is simply a low\nmagnetic field NS that has no discernible variation in\nspin over 5 years. If an isolated NS, the upper limit\non its spin-down power is much less than its bolometric X-ray luminosity, which leaves only internal cooling and/or accretion as possible energy sources. In either case, 1E 1207.4\u22125209 must have been born with a\nweak magnetic field and its long rotation period. We\nspeculate that these two parameters are causally related\nand, projecting from the near twins 1E 1207.4\u22125209 and\nPSR J1852+0040, possibly the physical basis of the CCO\nclass.\nAn additional benefit of this solution is the new\nconstraint on proposed absorption-line models for\n1E 1207.4\u22125209 that depend on the magnetic field\nstrength. Our upper limit on the dipole field is close to\nthe prediction of the electron cyclotron model for both\nlines, and perhaps oxygen for one of the lines. To actually make a significant measurement of Bp as small as\n8 \u00d7 1010 G from dipole spin-down would require a fully\nphase-coherent timing solution spanning & 6 yr, assuming that there is no glitch or other timing noise. Such a\nprogram would also be sensitive to accretion torques at\nthe lowest rates predicted here for spin-up. In case Bp\nis as small as 109 G and some of the X-ray luminosity of\n1E 1207.4\u22125209 is due to accretion from a debris disk,\nspin-up could be detected.\n\n4.3. Are CCOs a Class?\nThe half dozen radio-quiet CCOs are similar in their\nX-ray luminosities, high temperatures, and absence of\npulsar wind nebulae. Therefore, they may comprise a\nfairly uniform class defined by a weak magnetic field,\nwhich in turn results from slow natal rotation. If accreting, a slow initial spin is still unavoidable, since even at\n\nThis investigation is based on observations obtained\nwith XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member\nStates and NASA.
