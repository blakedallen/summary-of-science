This picture leads to substantially different antishadowing for charged and neutral\ncurrent processes, particularly in anti-neutrino reactions, thus affecting the extraction of\nthe weak-mixing angle sin2 \u03b8W .\nKeywords: Shadowing; neutrino.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe weak-mixing angle sin2 \u03b8W is an essential parameter in the standard model of\nelectroweak interactions. Until recently, a consistent value was obtained from all\nelectroweak observables 1 . However, the NuTeV Collaboration 2 has determined a\nvalue for sin2 \u03b8W from measurements of the ratio of charged and neutral current deep\ninelastic neutrino\u2013nucleus and anti-neutrino\u2013nucleus scattering in iron targets which\nhas a 3\u03c3 deviation with respect to the fit of the standard model predictions from\nother electroweak measurements 1 . Although the NuTeV analysis takes into account\nmany sources of systematic errors, there still remains the question of whether the\nreported deviation could be accounted for by QCD effects. Here we shall investigate\nwhether the anomalous NuTeV result for sin2 \u03b8W could be due to the different\nbehavior of leading-twist nuclear shadowing and antishadowing effects for charged\nand neutral currents 3 .\nThe physics of the nuclear shadowing in deep inelastic scattering can be most\neasily understood in the laboratory frame using the Glauber-Gribov picture. The\nvirtual photon, W or Z 0 , produces a quark-antiquark color-dipole pair which can\ninteract diffractively or inelastically on the nucleons in the nucleus. The destructive and constructive interference of diffractive amplitudes from Regge exchanges\non the upstream nucleons then causes shadowing and antishadowing of the virtual\nphoton interactions on the back-face nucleons. The coherence between processes\nwhich occur on different nucleons at separation LA requires small Bjorken xB :\n1/M xB = 2\u03bd/Q2 \u2265 LA . An example of the interference of one- and two-step processes in deep inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering is illustrated in Fig. 1. In the case\n1\n\n\fNovember 6, 2018 7:9\n\n2\n\nWSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nISchmidt\n\nIVAN SCHMIDT\n\nwhere the diffractive amplitude on N1 is imaginary, the two-step process has the\nphase i \u00d7 i = \u22121 relative to the one-step amplitude, producing destructive interference (the second factor of i arises from integration over the quasi-real intermediate\nstate.) In the case where the diffractive amplitude on N1 is due to C = + Reggeon\nexchange with intercept \u03b1R (0) = 1/2, for example, the phase of the two-step amplitude is \u221a12 (1 \u2212 i) \u00d7 i = \u221a12 (i + 1) relative to the one-step amplitude, thus producing\nconstructive interference and antishadowing. Due to the different energy behavior,\nthis also indicates that shadowing will be dominant at very small x values, where the\npomeron is the most important Regge exchange, while antishadowing will appear\nat a bit larger x values.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nThe one-step and two-step processes in DIS on a nucleus. If the scattering on nucleon\n\nN1 is via pomeron exchange, the one-step and two-step amplitudes are opposite in phase, thus\ndiminishing the q\u0304 flux reaching N2 . This causes shadowing of the charged and neutral current\nnuclear structure functions.\n\n2. Parameterizations of quark-nucleon scattering\nWe shall assume that the high-energy antiquark-nucleon scattering amplitude Tq\u0304N\nhas the Regge and analytic behavior characteristic of normal hadronic amplitudes.\nFollowing the model of Ref. 4, we consider a standard Reggeon at \u03b1R = 12 , an\nOdderon exchange term, a pseudoscalar exchange term, and a term at \u03b1R = \u22121, in\naddition to the Pomeron-exchange term.\nThe Pomeron exchange has the intercept \u03b1P = 1 + \u03b4. For the amputated q\u0304 \u2212 N\namplitude Tq\u0304N and q \u2212 N amplitude TqN with q = u, and d, N = p, and n, we assume the following parameterization, including terms which represent pseudoscalar\n\n\fNovember 6, 2018 7:9\n\nWSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nISchmidt\n\nAntishadowing\n\nReggeon exchange.

The isovector piece changes sign\ngoing to the d quark amplitude, and the odd C terms also change sign when one\ndeals with the corresponding antiparticle amplitude. We also include strange quarks,\nwith similar expressions. Although the phases of all these Regge exchanges are fixed,\ntheir strengths are taken as parameters, whose values are obtained from proton and\nneutron structure functions data and known quark distribution parameterizations,\nwhich in the model are related to the above amplitudes through:\nZ\n2 Cx2\nN0\nxq (x) =\n(2)\ndsd2 k\u22a5 ImTN0 (s, \u03bc2 ).\n(2\u03c0)3 1 \u2212 x\n3. Nuclear shadowing and antishadowing effects due to multiple\nscattering\nNow let us turn to the scattering on a nuclear (A) target. The q\u0304 \u2212 A scattering\namplitude can be obtained from the q\u0304 \u2212 N amplitude according to Glauber's theory\nas follows,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nN\nZ X\nX\n1\n1 k1 +k2 \u22121\nZ +N\n\u03b1\n(Tq\u0304p )k1 (Tq\u0304n )k2 \u03b8(k1 + k2 \u2212 1) (3)\nTq\u0304A =\nk1 + k2 k1 + k2 M\nk1 =0 k2 =0\n\nwhere M = Min{k1 + k2 , Z} \u2212 Max{k1 + k2 \u2212 N, 0} + 1 and \u03b1 =\ni/(4\u03c0pc.m.s1/2 (R2 + 2b)), with R2 = 23 R02 , R0 = 1.123A1/3fm, and b =\n10 (GeV/c)\u22122 . Then the nuclear quark distributions are readily obtained, and we get\npredictions for the ratio of structure functions F2A /F2N , which gives an excellent description of the experimental data 5,6 , showing both shadowing and antishadowing.\nneutrino\nmuon\nFurthermore, it agrees remarkably well with the data for the ratio F2A\n/F2A\n.\nFor details see Ref. 3.\nWe can now apply this same nuclear distribution functions to neutrino deep\ninelastic scattering in nuclei. Our results show that shadowing is similar for electromagnetic and weak currents, but that there is a much stronger antishadowing\neffect for antineutrinos, and that neutral and charge currents give different antishadowing. Since in our nucleon quark distributions parametrization there is still\nsome freedom, especially in the strange quark case, the details of these results could\nchange, but certainly not the overall picture, which shows a substantially different\nantishadowing for charged and neutral current reactions.\n\n\fNovember 6, 2018 7:9\n\n4\n\nWSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nISchmidt\n\nIVAN SCHMIDT\n\n4. Nuclear effects on extraction of sin2 \u03b8W\nThe observables measured in neutrino DIS experiments are the ratios of neutral\ncurrent to charged current events; these are related via Monte Carlo simulations\nto sin2 \u03b8W . In order to examine the possible impact of nuclear shadowing and antishadowing corrections on the extraction of sin2 \u03b8W , we will consider the Paschos\nand Wolfenstein relation 7\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2212\n1\n\u03c3(\u03bd\u03bc + N \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc + X) \u2212 \u03c3(\u03bd\u0304\u03bc + N \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc + X)\n2\n2\n= \u03c10\n\u2212 sin \u03b8W , (4)\nRN =\n\u03c3(\u03bd\u03bc + N \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 + X) \u2212 \u03c3(\u03bd\u0304\u03bc + N \u2192 \u03bc+ + X)\n2\nand a similar expression for the case in which there is a nuclear target (N \u2192\nA). We estimate the nuclear effects on the weak mixing angle in the following\nway. First, we use the cross sections to calculate the Paschos-Wolfenstein ratios\n\u2212\n\u2212\nRA (sin2 \u03b8W ) and RN (sin2 \u03b8W ) for various values of sin2 \u03b8W , and using the NuTeV\ncutoffs. Second, we extract \u03c12 by means of Eq. (4). We find a weak dependence of\n\u03c12 on sin2 \u03b8W and \u03c12 very close to 1. Finally, we use the obtained \u03c12 to extract\nthe shadowing/antishadowing effect on the weak-mixing angle \u2206 sin2 \u03b8W from the\nmodified relation:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2212\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212 (sin \u03b8W + \u2206 sin \u03b8W ) .\n(5)\nRA (sin \u03b8W ) = \u03c1\n2\nWe have have found that the nuclear modification to the weak-mixing angle is approximately \u03b4 sin2 \u03b8W = 0.001. The value of sin2 \u03b8W determined from the NuTeV\nexperiment, without including nuclear shadowing/antishadowing due to multiple\nscattering, is in absolute value 0.005 larger than the best value obtain from other\nexperiments. The model used here to compute nuclear shadowing/antishadowing\neffect would reduce the discrepancy between the neutrino and electromagnetic measurements of sin2 \u03b8W by about 20%, although this could be made larger by modifying\nthe strange quark distribution, which at present is not very well known.\nAcknowledgements\nWork done in collaboration with S.
