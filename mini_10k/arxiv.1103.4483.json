The problem to be solved is an optimal stopping\nproblem. These problems play an important role in many other fields of applied probability, too.\nThey also appear, for example, in mathematical statistics and portfolio optimization. Although a\ngeneral theory is well developed (cf. e.g. [PS06]), the value and the optimal strategy in optimal\nstopping problems cannot be found explicitly in most situations of interest. Many approaches\nhave been proposed for a numerical solution of optimal stopping problems in the last years.\nFor pricing the standard American options in the Black-Scholes market with one underlying the\nmost prominent methods are algorithms based on backward induction, partial differential equation\nmethods and integral equation methods, cf. e.g. [Det06, Chapter 8]. But these techniques are limited to low dimensional problems. Most techniques used today for more complex options are based\non Monte Carlo simulation techniques that were developed in the last years, see [Gla04, Chapter\n8] for an overview. We only want to mention stochastic mesh- and regression based-methods, that\nare often combined with using a duality method.\nA not that popular class of algorithms uses the linear programming approach. The basic idea is to\napproximate the underlying process by a Markov chain with a finite state space and to rewrite the\nresulting optimal stopping problem into a linear program and to solve this problem using standard\ntechniques, cf. e.g. [CS02] and the references therein for infinite time horizon problems. By the\ncurse of dimensionality this approach is limited to low dimensional problems.\nOur approach is different in nature to all approaches described above. The result of this algorithm\nis an analytic approximation to the value function in the continuation set without using discretization. This basic idea is described in the following section and it is shown how semi-infinite linear\nproblems come into play. In Section 3 we discuss how the well-known cutting plane algorithm\ncan be used to solve such problems. In Section 4 we motivate the further steps by discussing\nMathematisches Seminar, Christian-Albrechts-Universit\u00e4t zu Kiel, Ludewig-Meyn-Str. 4 D-24098 Kiel, Germany, e-mail: christensen@math.uni-kiel.de\n\n1\n\n\foptimal stopping problems with infinite time horizon for one-dimensional diffusion processes. In\nSection 5 we give a theoretical explanation for the accuracy of the algorithm locally around the\noptimization point. The ideas described so fare are then applied to the more interesting case of\nAmerican options on one and more assets with finite time horizon in Section 6. In this section the\ncalculation of the Greeks and implied-volatility problems are also discussed. In Section 7 we show\nhow the algorithm can be applied for multidimensional diffusions and L\u00e9vy processes with infinite\ntime horizon. Summarizing the results we can say that our algorithm provides good upper bounds\nfor the value. In Section 8 we shortly discuss how it can be used to also obtain lower bounds.\nFinally we give a short conclusion in Section 9.\n\n2\n\nThe approach\n\nWe consider a Markovian problem of optimal stopping as follows:\nLet (Xt )t\u22650 be a continuous time strong Markov process with state-space E, g : E \u2192 [0, \u221e)\nmeasurable, T \u2208 (0, \u221e] and r \u2265 0. We would like to maximize the expected value\nEx (e\u2212r\u03c4 g(X\u03c4 ))\nover all stopping times \u03c4 \u2264 T with respect to the underlying filtration for all starting points x \u2208 E.\nIf T = \u221e we say that we have an infinite time horizon, if T < \u221e we speak of a finite time horizon.\nFor convenience we assume T = \u221e in this section, then the value function does not depend on t;\nthis is no real restriction, see [PS06, Chapter I]; in this reference all the following basic facts can\nalso be found.\nWe define the value function v : E \u2192 R by\nv(x) = sup Ex (e\u2212r\u03c4 g(X\u03c4 )).\n\u03c4\n\nIf we know the value function v, then the optimal stopping problem is solved, but in most situations\nof interest it is not possible to give an explicit expression for v. From the theory for optimal\nstopping Markovian problems it is well-known that under minimal conditions the function v can\nbe characterized as the smallest r-excessive function w.r.t. X that majorizes g, i.e. for a fixed\nx0 \u2208 E it holds that\nv(x0 ) = inf{h(x0 ) : h is r-excessive, h \u2265 g}.\nHere r-excessive functions are the class of functions, that correspond to the standard supermartingales for Markov processes, see e.g. [PS06] and the references therein. This formulation corresponds to the characterization of the value process as the smallest supermartingale dominating the\ngain process in the general setting. Unfortunately the space of r-excessive functions for a process\nX is very wide in general, so that this characterization can be used for an explicit determination\nof the value only in some very special settings.\nNonetheless using standard terms of optimization theory v(x0 ) can be seen as the solution to the\nfollowing problem:\nmin!\ns.t.\n\nh(x0 )\nh(x) \u2265 g(x) for all x \u2208 E,\nh is r-excessive.\n\nTo see the direct connection to linear programming, let us rewrite the problem as follows: By\nMartin boundary theory \u2013 cf. [KW65] \u2013 under weak conditions on the process (Xt )t\u22650 each\nr-excessive function h can be represented as\nZ\nh(*) =\nkb (*)\u03c0(db),\n(1)\nB\n\n2\n\n\fwhere B is a compact space (called minimal Martin boundary), kb , b \u2208 B, are the minimal rexcessive functions and \u03c0 is a measure on B. Therefore we see that the optimization problem\ndescribed above can be seen as an linear infinite optimization problem:\nZ\nmin!\nkb (x0 )\u03c0(db)\n(LIP)\nZB\ns.t.\nkb (x)\u03c0(db) \u2265 g(x) for all x \u2208 E,\nB\n\n\u03c0 is a measure on A.\nHere infinite means that we have infinitely many restrictions (since we always assume E to be\ninfinite) and we optimize over an infinite-dimensional space of measures. One standard way to\ntreat this problem is to discretize the state space E. This leads to an ordinary linear programming\nproblem, but this problem is solvable only for low-dimensional spaces E by the curse of dimensionality.\nThe basic idea of our approach is to approximate the value of this linear infinite programming\nproblem by reducing the problem to a semi-infinite linear programming problem by choosing a\nfinite dimensional subspace of the measure space:\n1. Fix n \u2208 N and choose (in a suitable way) a finite subset H := {h1 , ..., hn } of r-excessive\nfunctions (equivalently choose n measures \u03c01 , ..., \u03c0n ).\n2. Solve the linear semi-infinite programming problem\nmin!\ns.t\n\nn\nX\ni=1\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbi hi (x0 )\n\n(LSIP)\n\n\u03bbi hi (x) \u2265 g(x) for all x \u2208 E\n\ni=1\n\nRemark 2.1. One way for choosing a suitable set H is the following, that will be used in the\nexamples below:\nTake a subset H 0 of the set of all r-excessive functions, that can be parametrized as H 0 = {ha : a \u2208\nA}. Then choose random parameters a(1) , ..., a(n) \u2208 A (e.g. randomly with respect to a suitable\nprobability distribution on A) and write hi := ha(i) , i = 1, ..., n.\nOne immediately obtains the following fact.\nProposition 2.2. P\nIf (\u03bb\u22171 , ..., \u03bb\u2217n ) is a solution of the linear semi-infinite programming problem\nn\n\u2217\n(LSIP), then h := i=1 \u03bb\u2217i hi (x) is an upper bound for v(x) for all x \u2208 E.\nPn\nProof. The function i=1 \u03bb\u2217i hi is an r-excessive function majorizing g. By the characterization of\nthe value function as smallest r-excessive function majorizing g we obtain the result.\nNote that although we only considered one special point x0 for the optimization the function\nh\u2217 is is an upper bound for the value function v on the whole domain E. As we will see later in\nmany situations this is even a good upper bound on a huge neighborhod of x0 . But before we\ncan apply this algorithm, the first question that arises is how linear semi-infinite programming\nproblems of the type (LSIP) can be solved:\n\n3\n\nCutting plane method for solving linear semi-infinite programming problems\n\nThe theory for solving linear semi-infinite programming problems of the type (LSIP) is well developed. A good overview is given in [HK93] where theory and algorithms are discussed. One\n3\n\n\fof the key solution techniques is the so-called \"cutting plane algorithm\". It is based on solving a\nsequence of ordinary linear programming problems, where in each step one further constraint is\nadded based on the results obtained so far. To be more precise in step k one considers {x1 , ..., xk }\nand solves\n\nmin!\ns.t.\n\nn\nX\ni=1\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbi hi (x0 )\n\n(LPk )\n\n\u03bbi hi (xj ) \u2265 g(xj ) for each j \u2208 {1, ..., k}\n\ni=1\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nIf (\u03bb1 , ...., \u03bbn ) is an optimal solution to (LPk ) one chooses xk+1 as a minimizer of the function\nx 7\u2192\n\nn\nX\n\n(k)\n\n\u03bbi hi (x) \u2212 g(x)\n\ni=1\n\nand uses the set {x1 , ..., xk+1 } in the next step. This sequence converges to the optimal solution\nunder mild restrictions. This algorithm and a relaxed version are e.g. discussed in [WFL98]\nWe see that a semi-infinite linear programming problem is reduced to a sequence of standard\nlinear programs. The background for the algorithm to work is the reduction theorem for semiinfinite linear programs, that states that the infinite restriction set E can be reduced to a set of not\nmore than n points, cf. [Kos91, Chapter 10.2]. The points x1 , x2 , ... are approximations to these\npoints. Therefore the number of iteration steps in the cutting plane algorithm depends on the\nnumber n of chosen excessive functions and not on the dimension of the underlying space. This is\nthe key point for the applicability of our algorithm in higher dimensions. The standard approach\nto solve optimal stopping problems using linear programming is based on the discretization of the\nstate space E, cf. e.g. [CS02]. Due to the curse of dimensionality this approach is limited to low\ndimensions.\nFor our approach to work we have to find suitable choices for A and H 0 (see Remark 2.1). As\na motivation for the following sections we first consider one-dimensional diffusion processes with\ninfinite time horizon:\n\n4\n\nOne-dimensional diffusions with infinite time horizon\n\nOne-dimensional diffusions have a wide range of applications e.g. in mathematical finance, mathematical biology, stochastic control and economics. We follow the definition given in [RY99, Chapter\nVII.3] that is based on the work of Feller and It\u00f4 and McKean (cf. [IM74]), i.e. we assume that\nthe process is a strong Markov process with continuous sample paths on an interval E. To prevent\nthat the interval E can be decomposed into disjoint subintervals from which (Xt )t\u22650 cannot exit,\nwe always assume that all diffusions are regular, that is\nPx (Xt = y for some t \u2265 0) > 0\n\nfor all x \u2208 int(I), y \u2208 I.\n\nTo find a suitable set H of r-excessive functions we consider the functions\n(\nEx (e\u2212r\u03c4a 1{\u03c4a <\u221e} ),\nx\u2264a\n\u03c81 (x) =\n\u2212r\u03c4x\n\u22121\n[Ea (e\n1{\u03c4x <\u221e} )] , x > a\nand\n\n(\n[Ea (e\u2212r\u03c4x 1{\u03c4x <\u221e} )]\u22121 ,\n\u03c82 (x) =\nEx (e\u2212r\u03c4a 1{\u03c4a <\u221e} ),\n4\n\nx\u2264a\nx > a,\n\n\ffor a fixed point a \u2208 int(E). These functions are called the minimal r-harmonic functions. Obviously \u03c81 is increasing and \u03c82 is decreasing. Furthermore they are positive, continuous and can\nbe used to characterize the boundary behavior of (Xt )t\u22650 . For results in this direction we refer to\n[IM74, Section 4.6]. All other positive r-harmonic functions are linear combinations of \u03c81 and \u03c82 .\nIn this section we want to study optimal stopping problems for one-dimensional diffusions with\ninfinite time horizon. These problems can be solved analytically using different techniques; we\nonly refer to [Muc79], [Sal85], [BL00], [DK03] and [CI10]. Nonetheless in many situations it can\nbe helpful to use numerical methods. The following theorem guarantees that H := {\u03c81 , \u03c82 } is a\nreasonable choice for our algorithm to work well.\nTheorem 4.1.

(a) Two proofs based on different methods can be found in [HS10, Theorem 4.2] and in\n[CI10, Corollary 2.2].\n(b) This is a general fact, see Proposition 5.1 in the following section.\n(c) If an optimal stopping time exists, then by the general theory the smallest is given by \u03c4 \u2217 =\ninf{t \u2265 0 : v(Xt ) = g(Xt )}. Since (Xt )t\u22650 has continuous sample paths the assertion holds by\nthe previous point.\nWe consider H := {\u03c81 , \u03c82 }. The theorem states that the value of the linear semi-infinite\nprogramming problem (LSIP) is equal to v(x0 ) (and not only an upper bound). Our algorithm\nprovides an accurate way for solving these problems using our approach. It is very easy to implement in every common language. This and all following examples were implemented in Matlab\non a standard PC with 1.3 GHz. We used the cutting plane method to solve (LSIP). This works\nfine and gives the results after some steps of iteration.\nAs an example we consider the gain function g(x) = x2 for a standard Brownian motion X. Using\nour algorithm after 5 steps of iteration the linear semi-infinite programming problem reaches\nthe solution v(0) = 5.322 and one furthermore obtains v(x) = 2.661\u03c81 (x) + 2.661\u03c82 (x) for\nx \u2208 [\u22124.618, 4.618], where \u03c81 (x) = e0.447x , \u03c82 (x) = e\u22120.447x . Moreover the optimal stopping\ntime is inf{t \u2265 0 : Xt 6\u2208 [\u22124.618, 4.618]}. A graphical illustration can be found in the following\nfigure.\nThis example is of course not that impressing since optimal stopping problems of this type\ncan \u2013 in many cases \u2013 even be solved analytically by standard techniques such as a free boundary\napproach. But nonetheless this example is instructive for dealing with other problems. We can\nsummarize the results as follows:\n\u2022 In the definition of the set H one can restrict oneself to r-harmonic functions (instead of\ngeneral r-excessive ones).\n5\n\n\f50\n40\n30\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\ng (x)\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nx\n\nFigure 1: Example for one-dimensional diffusions and infinite time horizon\n\n\u2022 Optimizing for one point x0 in the continuation set yields the value function for the whole\nconnection component of the continuation set containing x0 .\n\u2022 One also obtains the optimal stopping time.\n\n5\n\nApproximation in the connection component of the continuation set\n\nNext we give the theoretical background for the observation that using an r-harmonic function h\nas an approximation to the value function in a fixed point x0 yields a good approximation of the\nvalue function on the connection component of the continuation set containing x0 for a wide class\nof Markov processes (see Theorem 4.1(b) above and the numerical results in the next sections):\nLet C denote the connection component of the continuation set that contains x0 . We assume that\nthe underlying Markov process fulfills a strong maximum principle on C, i.e. we assume that each\nfunction that is r-harmonic and attains its non-negative maximum in C is constant. This principle\nis well known for certain processes as diffusions under mild conditions, cf. e.g. [Pin95, p. 84], and\nfor further classes of processes. Under these assumption we have:\nProposition 5.1. Let h be an r-harmonic majorant of v with h(x0 ) = v(x0 ).\nThen h|C = v|C .\nProof. Since v is r-harmonic in C so is h\u0303 = h \u2212 v. Furthermore h\u0303 \u2265 0 and h\u0303(x0 ) = 0. Therefore\nby the maximum principle h\u0303 is constant in C, i.e. h|C = v|C .\nNow we apply the ideas obtained so fare to the more interesting situation of finite time horizon\nand multidimensional diffusions:\n6\n\n\fx\n80\n90\n100\n110\n120\n\nv(x)\n21.606\n14.919\n9.946\n6.435\n4.061\n\nRLP\n21.615\n14.923\n9.951\n6.439\n4.064\n\n|v(x0 )-RLP|\n0.009\n0.004\n0.005\n0.004\n0.003\n\ntime\n\n9.4s\n\nTable 1: Approximation of the \"true\" value v(x) (taken form [AC97]) for the American put\nproblem on one asset with time horizon T = 0.5. RLP denotes the values for our algorithms. We\napplied the algorithm for the optimization point x0 = 100 and obtained the other values from this\noptimization as described above. The parameters are d = 1, K = 100, r = 0.06, T = 0.5, \u03c3 = 0.4.\n\n6\n\nTime-dependent gain\n\nIn many applications the gain also depends on time, e.g. in mathematical finance one often considers problems with a finite time horizon. In this case the value function is an space-time r-excessive\nfunctions. Before we come to applications we first discuss how the transition densities come into\nplay. To this end we use the integral representation as given in (1) for this case:\nFor a standard Brownian motion it is well known that each excessive function can be written as\nan integral taken over the densities of the Gaussian semigroup (cf. [Sie68]). More recently this\nresult was extended to a much more general setting in [Jan06]. Different results are given there.\nWe only state the following special fact, that is useful for us:\nUnder some mild technical assumptions if the underlying transition semigroup is a convolution\nsemigroup on a locally compact Abelian group E, then each each space-time excessive function h\nhas the representation\nZ\nh(t, x) = 1(s,\u221e) (t)pt\u2212s (x, y)\u03c0(dy, ds), x \u2208 E, t > 0,\nwhere \u03c0 is a measure on E \u00d7 [0, \u221e) and pt (x, y) is a suitably chosen density of the semigroup.\nStandard examples for densities, that are often used are the standard d-dimensional Brownian\nmotion, where\n\u0012\n\u0013\n|x \u2212 y|d\n1\npt (x, y) = \u221a d exp \u2212\n2t\n2\u03c0t\nand for Cauchy processes, where\npt (x, y) =\n\n(t2\n\nat\n,\n+ |x \u2212 y|2 ) n+1\n2\n\na = \u0393(\n\nn+1\n2\n\n)/(\u03c0 n+1\n2 ).\n\nWith this theoretic result in mind we can treat the well known examples from mathematical\nfinance:\n\n6.1\n\nAmerican put in the Black-Scholes model\n\nAs an example we consider a market Black-Scholes-market where the asset price process X is a\ngeometric Brownian motion under the risk neutral measure, that solves\ndXt = rXt dt + \u03c3Xt dWt\nfor a Brownian motion W . Although our approach is also applicable for other gain functions,\nin this subsection we concentrate on the fair price for an American put on X with strike K and\nmaturity T as given by\nv(t, x) = sup E(t,x) (e\u2212r\u03c4 (K \u2212 Xt+\u03c4 )+ ),\n\u03c4 \u2264T \u2212t\n\n7\n\n\fFigure 2: Graph of the approximated value function h\u2217\n\nsince this example is well studied from different points of view. No closed form solutions are known\nfor this problem, but many numerical methods are developed, cf. e.g. [Det06] for an overview.\nThe transition density p is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c3\n\u03c3 2 \u03bd 2 t (log(y) \u2212 log(x))2\npt (x, y) = \u221a\n(xy)\u2212\u03bd exp \u2212\n\u2212\n,\n2\n2\u03c3 2 t\n2 2\u03c0t\nwhere \u03bd = \u03bc/\u03c3 2 \u2212 1/2, cf. [BS02], p. 132. The first idea to apply our algorithms is now to take\nthese densities. But one sees that p has a singularity for t = 0. Therefore these densities are\nno good choice, since linear combinations cannot dominate the gain function. Therefore we take\nintegrated versions of the density. The easiest such functions are the r-harmonic function given\nby\nha (t, x) = E(t,x) (e\u2212r(T \u2212t) 1{XT \u2265a} )\n\u0013\n\u0012\nlog(x/a) + (r \u2212 \u03c3 2 /2)(T \u2212 t)\n\u2212r(T \u2212t)\n\u221a\n=e\n\u03a6 \u2212\n\u03c3 T \u2212t\nfor a \u2208 (0, \u221e) =: A. Using these functions we can apply our algorithm and compare the results to\nprices taken from [AC97]. The results can be found in the following table. We obtained the data\nin the following way:\nWe use our approach with the starting value x0 = 100, t0 = 0 and n = 100 and choose the\nparameters a1 , ...., an according to a uniform distribution on [0, 100]. Applying the optimization\ntakes around 10 second. Then we obtained the value\nPn at x0 = 100 and t0 = 0 and obtained\nparameters \u03bb\u22171 , ..., \u03bb\u2217n such that the function h\u2217 := i=1 \u03bb\u2217i hai is an upper bound of the value\nfunction v. Then we used h\u2217 to get the upper bounds for other starting values by just evaluating\nthis function at the desired point (t, x). Although h\u2217 is optimized for the point (t0 , x0 ) = (0, 100)\nthe upper bounds for the other points are very good too for other starting prices as shown in\n8\n\n\fx\n(80, 80)\n(80, 100)\n(80, 120)\n(100, 80)\n(100, 100)\n(100, 120)\n(120, 80)\n(120, 100)\n(120, 120)\n\ninterval in [Rog02]\n[38.01 , 38.35]\n[32.23 , 32.60]\n[28.54 , 29.01]\n[33.34 , 33.59]\n[25.81 , 26.02]\n[20.75 , 21.05]\n[31.21 , 31.31]\n[22.77 , 22.83]\n[16.98 , 16.98]\n\nRLP\n38.30\n32.28\n28.58\n33.53\n25.86\n20.73\n31.30\n22.80\n16.99\n\nComp. time\n\n42s\n\nTable 2: This table states the results for the min-put problem in a Black-Scholes market with two\nassets and parameters K = 100, r = 0.06, T = 0.5, \u03c31 = 0.4, \u03c32 = 0.8, n = 150. x denotes the\nstarting value. We applied our algorithm with starting vale (100, 100) and obtained the further\napproximations reported in column \"RLP\" by evaluating the approximation h\u2217 . For comparison\nwe also state the values from [Rog02].\n\nthe table. Hence we only need one approximation for all time horizons and starting values in the\nconnected component of the continuation set, see Figure 6.1. Hence we have found an analytically\ngiven function that is a good approximation to the value function on a huge subset of the timespace domain. With the results of Section 5 in mind this is not surprising.\n\n6.2\n\nAmerican min put on d assets\n\nAs discussed in the introduction it is much more challenging to consider multiple underlyings, i.e.\nthe case that X = (X (1) , ..., X (d) ) is a diffusion in a subset of Rd . As an example we consider the\nmulti-dimensional Black-Scholes market, i.e. X (1) , ..., X (d) are geometric Brownian motions with\nfixed correlations of the underlying Brownian motions. One benchmark example in the literature\nis a put option on the minimum of the assets in a Black-Scholes market, i.e.\n\u0013+\n\n\u0012\ng(x1 , ..., xd ) =\n\nK\u2212\n\nmin\ni\u2208{1,...,d}\n\nxi\n\n.\n\nWe compare our results to the numerical results given in [Rog02, Section 4.2]. With the same\nmotivation as for one underlying we could choose the set H 0 of r-harmonic functions to consist of\nthe functions\n\u0010\n\u0011\nha (t, x) = E(t,x) e\u2212r(T \u2212t) 1{X (1) \u2265a1 ,...,X (d) \u2265a } ,\nT\n\nT\n\nd\n\nwhere a = (a1 , ..., ad ) \u2208 (0, \u221e)d . For highly correlated component processes and high dimensions\nthe evaluation of these expectations takes much computational time. In these cases it is more\nreasonable to take the prices of European exchange options between the assets, since these integrals\ncan be computed explicitly. Let us remark that all reasonable choices we tried lead to good\nresults. We again used the point x0 = (100, ..., 100) as the optimization point. Exact results and\ncomputational time can be found in the following tables. Summarizing we can say\n\u2022 Optimizing for one special starting point gives very accurate approximations of the value\nfunction in the continuation set.\n\u2022 The same is true for varying time horizons.\n\u2022 The algorithm also works for large dimensions (e.g. \u2265 10), where normally only Monte-Carlo\nmethods are applicable.\n\n9\n\n\fd\n2\n3\n4\n5\n10\n15\n\ninterval in [Rog02]\n[24.87 , 25.16]\n[31.21 , 31.76]\n[35,72 , 36.28]\n[39.01 , 39.47]\n[47.99 , 48.33]\n[52.23 , 52.14]\n\nRLP\n24.93\n31.41\n36.01\n39.21\n48.01\n52.10\n\nComp. time\n41 s\n72 s\n115 s\n103 s\n324 s\n612 s\n\nTable 3: In this table we state the results in the same setting as in Table 6.2 for dimensions 2 to\n15. The parameters now are \u03c3i = 0.6, T = 0.5, K = 100, r = 0.06\n\n6.3\n\nExercise boundary\n\nUsing our approximation of the value function we can also approximate the optimal exercise\nboundary: For the true value function v and each t \u2208 [0, T ] the exercise boundary is characterized\nas the largest 0 of v(t, *) \u2212 g(*). Therefore for an approximation we use the minimizer b(t) of\n(h\u2217 \u2212 g)(t, *) for each t \u2208 [0, T ]. A priori it is not clear that this approximation will be accurate\neven if h\u2217 is a good approximation of the value function, since b(*) is very sensitive to the shape of\nh\u2217 in both variables x and t. Nonetheless this approximation is very good as shown in the figure\nbelow. There we compared the boundary to the approximations by standard methods given in\n[LS10]. We would like to underline that the approximations is even good for small time horizons.\n\n6.4\n\nCalculation of the Greeks\n\nFor risk management and hedging the Greeks (sensitives) of the option play a major role. The\nDelta of the option \u2013 i.e. the derivative with respect to the asset price \u2013 is of special interest.\nUsing Monte-Carlo techniques it is not straightforward to calculate it, see [Gla04, Chapter 7].\nUsing our method we obtain an approximation h\u2217 (t, x) to the value function on the continuation\nset as a function of space and time. Therefore we can calculate the Delta and the Theta of the\noption by simply taking derivatives of h\u2217 with respect to x resp. t. Comparing with the results in\nthe literature yields that these estimates are very accurate.\n\n6.5\n\nCalculation of implied volatilities\n\nAnother important topic in the valuation of American options is finding the implied volatilities for\na given market price v0 . From a first view our approach does not seem to be reasonable for this\nquestion, because the value function for one special volatility first of all does not give information\nabout the values for other volatilities. In the following we discuss how this important topic can\nnonetheless be dealt with:\nFor a fixed starting volatility \u03c31 we can approximate the price of the asset using our algorithm by\nfinding an approximation h1 (0, x; \u03c31 ) and can compare this result with the market price v0 . Note\nthat this expression gives an explicit function of \u03c31 , but for \u03c3 6= \u03c31 it is not clear if h1 (0, x; \u03c3)\nis an accurate approximation of the price in the model with volatility \u03c3. But nonetheless we can\nsolve the equation\nh1 (0, x; \u03c3) = v0\nfor \u03c3. Denote the solution by \u03c32 . Using our approach again we find a new approximation\nh2 (x, 0; \u03c32 ) that can be used to determine \u03c33 and so on. In a general setting there is no hope\nto prove convergence of this sequence to the implied volatility, but nonetheless in our examples\none obtains a very accurate approximation after three or four steps of iteration even for starting\nvolatilities that are fare away from the correct value. This leads to a very easy to implement\nmethod. Let us emphasize that there is no theoretical justification for the approach to work, but\nnonetheless it seems to work very well.\n\n10\n\n\f100\n95\n90\n85\n80\n75\n70\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFigure 3: The black graph is the approximated stopping boundary b(*) for parameters T = 1, K =\n100, r = 0.1 obtained by our algorithm. The red graphs are approximations taken from [LS10],\nwhere the upper one is obtained by the PSOR-method and the lower one is the analytical approximation given by Zho. For comparison the green line is the optimal stopping boundary for the\nperpetual American put.\n\n7\n\nInfinite time horizon\n\nAfter discussing finite time horizon problems in the previous section now we want to discuss the\ncase of an infinite time horizon. For practical questions in financial markets this case is not so\nimportant; perpetual options are only used as a bound for finite time problems. Nonetheless for\nother applications such as sequential statistics and portfolio optimization numerical solutions are\nof importance. Most other numerical methods cannot be applied to these problems, since a discretization of an infinite time horizon would be necessary. Exception are the Forward Improvement\nIteration algorithm discussed in [Irl06] and the results of [CS02].\n\n7.1\n\nMultidimensional diffusions\n\nIn the following we are interested in the case that X = (Xt )t\u22650 is a diffusion process with state\nspace E \u2286 Rd , d \u2265 1. For applying our approach we first have to take a suitable subset of\nthe class of r-excessive functions w.r.t. X with a suitable parametrization. As in the case of\nfinite time horizon we propose to choose a class of r-harmonic functions on E. In this setting\nwe propose to take the minimal r-harmonic functions; that are the extreme points of the set of\nall r-harmonic functions on E and can be characterized using the Martin boundary. There is a\none-to-one correspondence between minimal r-harmonic functions.\nNext we give an examples of interest in mathematical finance where explicit results can be obtained.\nProposition 7.1. Let X be a d-dimensional Brownian motion on Rd with covariance matrix (\u03c3ij )\n\n11\n\n\fand drift \u03bc = (\u03bc1 , .., \u03bcd ), i.e. the generator of X is given by\nL=\nWrite\n\nX\n1X\n\u22022\n\u2202\n\u03c3ij\n+\n\u03bci\n.\n2 i,j\n\u2202xi \u2202xj\n\u2202x\ni\ni\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\n\uf8fc\nd\nd\n\uf8fd\nX\nX\n1\nA = a \u2208 Rd :\n\u03c3ij ai aj +\n\u03bci ai \u2212 r = 0 .\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe\n2 i,j=1\ni=1\n\nThen\n{x 7\u2192 exp(a \u2022 x) : a \u2208 A}\nis the set of all minimal positive r-harmonic functions, where \u2022 denotes the usual scalar product.\nThis result is well-known, a discussion for this situation can be found in [CI10]. As a standard\nexample for a multidimensional problem we consider a perpetual American put option on on index,\ni.e. on a linear combination of assets. This means we consider d (correlated) Brownian motions\n(1)\n(d)\nX (1) , ..., X (d) with drifts \u03bc1 , ..., \u03bcd and covariance structure (\u03c3ij )di,j=1 . We interpret eX , ..., eX\nas d assets in a Black-Scholes market. Our gain function is given by\ng(x1 , ..., xd ) = (K \u2212\n\nd\nX\n\n\u03b1 i exi ) +\n\nfor all (x1 , ..., xd ) \u2208 Rd .\n\ni=1\n\nHere \u03b11 , ..., \u03b1d are positive weight parameters. These options were considered from different points\nof view, see e.g. [Pau01].\nTo use our approach Proposition 7.1 suggests to take\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\nd\nd\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2\nX\nX\n1\n\u03c3ij ai aj +\n\u03bci ai \u2212 r = 0 .\nA := a \u2208 Rd :\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\n2\ni,j=1\n\ni=1\n\nand\nH 0 := {x 7\u2192 exp(a \u2022 x) : a \u2208 A}.\nThe set A is an ellipsoid and we can choose the random parameters a(1) , ..., a(n) from a uniform\ndistribution on A.\nOne cannot expect to obtain explicit results for this problem, so that we have to compare our\nresults to other approximative results. For this reason we use the forward improvement iteration\nalgorithm discussed in [Irl06]. This algorithm can be applied easily in dimension d = 2, so that\nwe use it for our comparison there. We used the forward improvement iteration algorithm with\na discretization of [0, 2] \u00d7 [0, 2] in 100 \u00d7 100 points. The results are given in the following table.\nHere the approximation of v(x) using our approach is denoted by RLP, the results by the forward\nimprovement iteration algorithm is denoted by FII.\nAlthough the forward iteration improvement algorithm is limited to low dimensions, our algorithm is not. It is no problem to to apply it to high dimensional problems.\n\n7.2\n\nL\u00e9vy processes with infinite time horizon\n\nL\u00e9vy processes are an important class of jump processes that can be used in many fields of\napplication such as insurance and finance. Optimal stopping problems with infinite time horizon\ninvolving L\u00e9vy processes were studied from different points of view in the last years. For these\nproblems overshoot plays a fundamental role. This leads to certain problems for an explicit\nsolution.

[Mor02], [NS07], [MS07] and [CI09].\nTo use our approach we again use the following potential-theoretic representation of r-excessive\nfunctions:\nAs usual we define the resolvent kernel U r by\n\u0012Z \u221e\n\u0013\ne\u2212rt 1{Xt \u2208A} dt , A measurable, x \u2208 Rd\nU r (x, A) = Ex\n0\nr\n\nand we assume that U (x, *) is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure for all\nx \u2208 Rd . See [Ber96, Chapter I.3] for a characterization; all the next facts can also be found in this\nreference.\nIn the above situation there exists a unique measurable function h : Rd \u2192 [0, \u221e] such that h(* \u2212 x)\nis a Lebesgue density of U r (x, *) for each x \u2208 Rd and y 7\u2192 h(\u2212y) is r-excessive. For certain\nprocesses h can be calculated explicitly. Now we can formulate the important representation\nresult in the spirit of equation (1):\nProposition 7.2. Any integrable r-excessive function w can be represented as\nZ\nw(x) =\nh(a \u2212 x)\u03c0(da), x \u2208 Rd ,\nRd\n\nwhere \u03c0 is a unique finite measure on Rd .\nRemark 7.3. For r = 0, i.e. for problems without discounting, an analogous result holds, if the\nL\u00e9vy process is assumed to be transient, see [MS07] for the case d = 1.\nNow we can use the algorithm described above by taking\nA = Rd , H 0 = {y 7\u2192 h(a \u2212 y) : a \u2208 A}.\nAs an example we consider the Novikov-Shiryaev problem, i.e. we use g(x) = (x+ )\u03b3 , \u03b3 \u2265 1 as the\ngain function. This problem was completely solved semi-explicitly in [NS04] and [NS07].\nTo check our numerical approach for L\u00e9vy processes we would like to compare our numerical\nresults to explicit results. To this end we assume X to be a compound Poisson process with drift\nand positive exponential jumps, i.e. X has the form\nXt = ct +\n\nNt\nX\n\nYi , t \u2265 0,\n\ni=1\n\nwhere c < 0, (Nt )t\u22650 is a Poisson process with intensity \u03bb and (Yi )i\u2208N is a sequence of independent\nExp(\u03b1)-distributed random variables. In this setting an explicit solution was obtained in [MS07].\nIn this case the Green function h is given by\n(\nA2 e\u03c1x , x \u2264 0\nh(x) =\n\u2212A1 ,\nx > 0,\n13\n\n\f40\n30\n20\n10\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\nFigure 4: Gain function (black) and approximated value function (red) in the L\u00e9vy example for\nparameters r = 2, \u03b1 = 1, \u03c1 = 0.5, \u03bb/c = \u22120.5, \u03b3 = 2.5.\n\nwhere \u03c1 := \u03b1 + \u03bb/c > 0, A1 := \u03b1/(\u03bb + c\u03b1) and A2 := \u03bb/(a\u03bb + a2 \u03b1), see [MS07, Section 5].\nWe applied our algorithm with n = 150, and choosing the parameters a(1) , ..., a(n) according to a\nuniform distribution on the interval [0, 20] turned out to be a reasonable choice. The computational\nresults are given in Figure 7.2. Using these r-excessive functions we obtain a good approximation\nnot only on the continuation set, but also on the optimal stopping set. The valuation of American\noptions with finite time horizon in L\u00e9vy markets will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming paper.\n\n8\n\nLower bounds of the value function\n\nAs explained above our method immediately leads to good upper bounds of the value function.\nThis is indeed the important contribution of our approach since most Monte-Carlo methods leads\nto good lower bounds, but nonetheless to deal with new problems one also would like to obtain\nlower bounds for the value. In this section we discuss how this can be realized using our approach.\nFor easy examples like the American put in the Black-Scholes market the method also gives an\napproximation to the stopping boundary. Using the stopping time associated with this boundary\nleads to very good lower bounds.\nFor\ncomplex examples the idea is to use the approximation of the value function h\u2217 =\nPn more\n\u2217\ni=1 \u03bbi hi . The first idea is to choose the optimal stopping time\n\u03c4 \u2217 = inf{t \u2265 0 : g(Xt ) \u2265 v(t, Xt )}\nand to substitute v by h\u2217 . But since h\u2217 \u2265 g and h\u2217 is just an approximation to v this stopping\ntime does not seem to be appropriate. Instead we choose \u000f > 0 and take\n\u03c4 0 = inf{t \u2265 0 : g(Xt ) + \u000f \u2265 v(t, Xt )},\n14\n\n\fthen it is well known that \u03c4 0 is \u000f-optimal in the sense that\n0\n\nE( t, x)(e\u2212r\u03c4 g(X\u03c4 0 )) \u2265 v(t, x) \u2212 \u000f\nunder minimal conditions. Now we take\n\u03c40 := inf{t \u2265 0 : g(Xt ) + \u000f \u2265 h\u2217 (t, Xt )}\nand use\nh\u2217 (t, x) := E(t,x) (e\u2212r\u03c40 g(X\u03c40 ))\nis a lower bound of v(t, x). In most problems we cannot find analytical expressions for the expectation on the right hand side, but it can be approximated using Monte Carlo techniques. In our\nexamples the lower approximations were quite near the upper ones.\nAnother approach is to use the r-harmonic function h\u2217 for variants of other methods like the\nLongstaff-Schwartz algorithm. This will be discussed by the author in a forthcoming paper.\n\n9\n\nConclusion\n\nAs a conclusion let us summarize the important properties of the approach described above:\n\u2022 The algorithm is based on reducing the ILP-problem connected to optimal stopping to a\nSILP-problem by choosing finitely many r-excessive functions.\n\u2022 No discretization of space and time and no Monte-Carlo-elements are necessary.\n\u2022 The algorithm is very easy to implement in every common language (1 page of programming\ncode!).\n\u2022 Optimizing for one special starting point gives very accurate upper bound of the value\nfunction in the continuation set.\n\u2022 The same is true for varying time horizons.\n\u2022 The algorithm also works for large dimensions (e.g. \u2265 10), where apart from it only MonteCarlo methods are applicable.\n\u2022 The Greeks can be found immediately.\n\u2022 Implicit volatilities can be calculated.\n\u2022 The algorithm can be used for infinite time horizons, too.\n\nReferences\n[AC97]\n\nF.
