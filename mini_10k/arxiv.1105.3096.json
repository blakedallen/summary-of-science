During the s process, neutrons are captured by seed nuclei in the Fe region, slowly building up heavier elements. As the rate\nof neutron captures is slow compared to the decay rate\nof unstable reaction products element production follows\nthe valley of stability. The neutron density in the burning environment is one of the parameters that determines\nthe final abundance and the end point of the reaction\npath. At the same time, isotopes with high abundance\nor high neutron capture cross sections can capture a large\namount of free neutrons, thereby acting as a neutron poison in the burning environment.\nRecent results from calculations of massive, fast rotating stars at low metallicity showed a large increase in the\ns process isotope production over the yields from nonrotating stars [2]. Due to the lower abundance of heavier neutron poisons like 25 Mg in low-metallicity conditions, 16 O becomes the dominant neutron poison via the\nreaction 16 O(n,\u03b3)17 O. The captured neutrons can then\nbe released again by the reaction 17 O(\u03b1, n)20 Ne depending on the strength of the competing reaction channel\n17\nO(\u03b1, \u03b3)21 Ne. The competition of the two reaction channels determines the influence of the poisoning effect of\n16\nO and, thus, the mass range of the produced elements.\nIn addition, it has a strong effect on the expected yields\n[3\u20135].\nThe two stellar burning phases in which the s process\ntakes place in massive stars are core Helium and shell\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\n\u2021\n\nabest1@nd.edu\nPresent address: Institute for Environmental Research, Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, Kirrawee\nDC, Australia\nPresent address: Institute for Applied Physics, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany\n\nCarbon burning at temperatures of T = 0.3 GK and 1\nGK, respectively. For the reaction 17 O+\u03b1, \u03b1-energies\nof around 0.6 MeV and 1.3 MeV are therefore important. The reaction 17 O(\u03b1, n)20 Ne has previously been\nmeasured in the energy range between E\u03b1 = 0.6 MeV and\n12.5 MeV [6\u20138], but so far no experimental data exist on\nthe 17 O(\u03b1, \u03b3)21 Ne (Q = 7347.9 keV) reaction. Reaction\nrates given in the compilation by Caughlan and Fowler\n[9] and by Descouvemont derived from a theoretical calculation [10] differ by up to four orders of magnitude in\nthe relevant energy range. This leads to substantially\ndifferent elemental overproductions of the s elements in\nlow-metallicity rotating stars [5]. Because of this enormous uncertainty in the reaction rate, experimental data\nare of critical importance as input for more accurate sprocess simulations.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n\nThe \u03b1-beam was provided by the 4MV KN accelerator\nat the University of Notre Dame Nuclear Science Laboratory. Energy calibration and resolution (1.1 keV) were\ndetermined using the well-known Ep = 991.86 \u00b1 0.03 keV\nand Ep = 1317.14 \u00b1 0.07 keV resonances in 27 Al [11].\nThe beam energy was reproducible within \u00b12 keV between different hysteresis cycles of the analyzing magnet\nduring the course of the experiment.\nThe beam current on target was kept in the range of\n10 \u03bcA to 30 \u03bcA in order to limit target degradation. To\nreduce Carbon deposition a liquid Nitrogen cooled copper tube (cold finger) was mounted in front of the target.\nA bias of -400 V was applied to the cold finger for suppression of secondary electrons. The beam was rastered\nwith magnetic steerers to produce a beam spot of size 1.4\ncm \u00d7 1.6 cm on the target. The target was mounted at\n45\u25e6 with respect to the beam direction and was directly\nwater cooled with deionized water. The target chamber\nwas electrically isolated for charge collection.\nTargets were prepared by anodization of 0.3 mm thick\n\n\f2\nTantalum backings using H2 O enriched to 90.1% in 17 O\u00a7\n(the 18 O content of the water was specified to be 0.4%).\nThis process is known to produce homogeneous films of\nTa2 O5 [12, 13]. The film thickness can be controlled in\na reproducible way through regulation of the maximal\nanodization voltage. The target thickness was chosen to\nbe about 12 keV for an \u03b1-beam of 1000 keV.\nA Ge detector with an efficiency of 55% with respect\nto NaI at E\u03b3 = 1333 keV was set up at an angle of\n45\u25e6 with respect to the beam axis. To reduce the radiation damage from the strong 17 O(\u03b1, n)20 Ne channel, a\npolyethylene disk 8.3 cm in diameter and 2.0 cm thick\nwas attached to the front cap of the detector to scatter\nreaction neutrons away from the Ge crystal. To optimize\nefficiency the detector was then positioned in close geometry, resulting in a distance of 2.9 cm between target and\ndetector. The target chamber and the detector itself were\nsurrounded by at least 4.5 cm of lead to suppress natural\nbackground radiation. The lead shielding reduced a natural background line from 214 Pb at E\u03b3 = 351.9 keV by a\nfactor of 20, enabling a clearer signal from the dominant\ntransition in 21 Ne (E\u03b3 = 350.7 keV). The detector was\nchecked for neutron induced damage in regular intervals\nby monitoring the line shape of the E\u03b3 = 1173 and 1332\nkeV \u03b3-rays from a 60 Co source. No decline in resolution\nor change of the peak shape was observed over the course\nof the experiment.\n\n133\n\nBa\nCs\n60\nCo\n56\nCo\n27\nAl(p,\u03b3 ) 1317 keV\n27\nAl(p,\u03b3 ) 992 keV\n137\n\nEfficiency [%]\n\n1\n\n10-1\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\nEnergy [keV]\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\nFIG. 1.

The data points from 56 Co and the 1317 keV\n27\nAl(p,\u03b3)28 Si resonance are relative measurements that have\nbeen scaled to coincide with the absolute efficiencies.\n\nThe absolute peak efficiency of the setup in the energy range E\u03b3 = 276 keV to 10800 keV was determined\nusing calibrated (\u00b1 5%) 137 Cs, 60 Co and 133 Ba sources\nplaced onto the target as well as with the well-known\nstrength of the Ep = 992 keV resonance in 27 Al(p,\u03b3)28 Si\n\n\u00a7\n\nPurchased from Isotech, Miamisburg, OH\n\n(\u03c9\u03b3 = 1.93 \u00b1 0.13 eV) [14]. The 137 Cs source measurements were also used to determine the total efficiency\nof the setup that was needed for summing corrections.\nThe total efficiency as a function of energy was simulated using Geant4 [15]. Lead shield, target chamber and\nholder and detector geometry were implemented as close\nas possible to the physical setup. The results were scaled\nto coincide with the source measurement (9.1 \u00b1 1.0% at\nE\u03b3 = 662 keV). The efficiencies from the Al resonance\nwere corrected for summing effects using the branchings\ngiven in [16].\nMeasurements with a 133 Ba source were performed\nwith the detector at the close distance (2 cm) and with\nthe detector retracted to a larger distance (12.4 cm) to\ninvestigate summing effects on the efficiency determination. The influence of summing on the Ba measurements\ncan be determined as follows: the transitions which can\nbe affected by summing involve photons with energies\nE\u03b3 = 81 keV and E\u03b3 = 80 keV. There was enough absorbing material between source and detector (0.25 mm\nTantalum backing, 1 mm brass target holder and the 2 cm\nthick polyethylene disk) to attenuate low-energy photons\nby approximately 98%, resulting in summing corrections\nof less than 0.5%. A comparison between Ba measurements in close and in far geometry showed no difference\nin the relative intensities of the \u03b3-ray peaks, as would be\nexpected without summing effects.\nThe Geant4 simulation was also used to investigate the\ndifference between point and area sources on the detector\nefficiency. The decay radiation from a 60 Co source was\nsimulated, first with the source of the \u03b3-rays in the center\nof the target and then with the emission point randomly\ndistributed on an area equal to the size of the beam spot.\nThe effect was found to be less than 1%.\nIn addition to these absolute measurements, relative\nefficiency data were augmented using the 1317 keV resonance in 27 Al(p,\u03b3)28 Si and with a 56 Co source. These\nspectra were measured with the detector at the large distance and the relative efficiencies were scaled to coincide\nwith the absolute efficiency measurements. The resulting\nefficiency curve is shown together with the data in Fig.\n1.\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nTo search for resonances in the 17 O(\u03b1, \u03b3)21 Ne reaction,\nan excitation curve (see Fig. 2) in the energy range of\nE\u03b1 = 750 keV to 1650 keV was measured in steps of 10\nkeV or less. For this search the E\u03b3 = 350.7 keV transition\nfrom the first excited state to the ground state in the\n21\nNe compound nucleus was observed. This transition\nwas chosen because of the high efficiency of the detector\nfor \u03b3-rays with relatively low energies and because most\n\u03b3-cascades proceed through the first excited state in 21 Ne\n[17].

Room background contributions to the analysed peak\nhave been subtracted. The high yield around 1450 keV arises\nfrom the contribution of a strong resonance in 18 O(\u03b1, n1 )21 Ne\nproducing the same \u03b3-transition.

The 18 O(\u03b1, n1 ) reaction was measured over the\nwhole energy range covered in this experiment using the\nsame experimental setup [18]. The contributions due to\nthe target contamination were subtracted from the experimental yield of the 17 O(\u03b1, \u03b3) reaction. Fig. 2 shows\nthe resulting yield curve (not corrected for the 18 O contribution). The influence of the 18 O(\u03b1, n1 ) reaction is\nclearly visible in the energy range of 1400 keV to 1600\nkeV where its strongest resonance in this energy range\ndominates the overall yield.\nTarget stability was frequently checked by scanning\nthe E\u03b1 = 1620 keV resonance in 17 O(\u03b1, n1 )20 Ne using\nthe 1633.7 keV transition to the 20 Ne ground state [18].\nWhen a resonance was found it was rescanned in finer\nsteps and long runs with a fresh target were taken on top\nof and just below the resonance. A total of four similar\n17\nO targets were used over the course of the experiment.\nResonances were found at E\u03b1 = 1002 keV, 1386 keV,\nand 1619 keV, in good agreement with known states in\n21\nNe (see Tab. I). On-resonance spectra of two of the\nresonances are shown in Fig. 3.

In the \u03b3-spectrum of the 1619 keV\nresonance (Fig. 3b) the prominent 1633 keV line from\n17\nO(\u03b1, n1 )20 Ne can be clearly seen as well as some peaks\ndue to the interaction of reaction neutrons with the Germanium detector. The spectrum of the lowest energy\nresonance is shown in Fig. 3a. The state lies below the\nn1 threshold and the neutron yield is sufficiently low to\nhave a much cleaner spectrum, enabling the identification of more resonant transitions. Resonant \u03b3 transitions were identified by comparison with off-resonance\nruns and compared to known transitions in 21 Ne [11, 17].\nThe respective resonance strengths were calculated\n\n\f4\nTABLE I.

(1) and \u03bb\nstands for the de Broglie wavelength [19]. The stopping\npowers were calculated using the computer code SRIM\n[20]. The experimental stopping powers have an accuracy of \u00b15% for alpha particles in this energy range. The\nextracted \u03c9\u03b3 values, the respective resonance and level\nenergies are given in Table I. The following contributions\nto the experimental uncertainty were considered: current\nintegration \u00b13%, absolute efficiency (dominated by the\nresonance strength of the 992 keV 26 Al resonance) \u00b17%,\nrelative efficiency \u00b15%, stopping power \u00b15% and the statistical uncertainty in the number of counts in the analyzed peaks. Angular correlation effects were estimated\nto be less than 10% for primary transitions and less than\n5% for the 350 keV line. Overall, this resulted in an\nexperimental uncertainty for the resonance strengths of\n12% (+ the statistical error).\nFor the two resonant states with observed primary\ntransitions, a possible range of J\u03c0 assignments was deduced by comparison of the observed lower limit of \u03b3\n\u0393 \u0393\nstrengths (using \u03c9\u03b3 = \u03c9 \u03b1\u0393 \u03b3 < \u03c9\u0393\u03b3 ) with the recommended upper limits from [21]. The counts in the primary peaks have been corrected for summing effects using the branchings taken from [17].\nTABLE II.

[17]\n100(9)\n39(13)\n12(6)\n\nThe E\u03b1 = 1002 keV resonance: The laboratory resonance energy was determined from the 50% point of the\nyield curve to be 1002\u00b12 keV corresponding to an excitation energy of Ex = 8159 \u00b1 2 keV in 21 Ne. Table II shows\nthe observed \u03b3 branchings of this state in comparison to\npreviously reported values [17]. The resonance strength\nwas determined from the yield of the secondary E\u03b3 = 350\nkeV transition as \u03c9\u03b3 = 7.6 \u00b1 0.9 meV. Allowed spins of\nthe state are in the range of 5/2 to 11/2, in agreement\nwith the assignment of 9/2 by [17]. Considerations of\n\nthe balance of the feeding and the decay of intermediate\nstates show that about 30% of primary transitions are\nunobserved. As there are no unidentified major lines in\nthe on-resonance spectra, these unobserved transitions\nshould be of low relative intensity and spread out over\nmultiple states.\nThe observation of a resonance at this energy in a recent recoil separator measurement at the TRIUMF facility has been reported in a conference proceeding [22] but\nso far no results are available for comparison.\nThe E\u03b1 = 1386 keV resonance: The resonance energy\nwas measured as 1386\u00b12 keV (Ex = 8470\u00b12 keV). Due to\nthe weakness of the resonance only the prominent E\u03b3 =\n350 keV transition could be observed. The resonance\nstrength was found to be \u03c9\u03b3 = 1.2 \u00b1 0.2 meV. As no\nprimary transitions could be observed and there are no\nbranchings for this state available in the literature it was\nnot attempted to correct for summing effects. Thus, the\nresonance strength provided here should only be used as\na lower limit.\nThe E\u03b1 = 1619 keV resonance: The energy of the resonance is 1619 \u00b1 2 keV which translates to an excitation\nenergy in 21 Ne of 8659 \u00b1 2 keV. As in [17], the only observed primary transition is to the 6033 keV state. The\nresonance strength was determined from the intensity of\nthe E\u03b3 = 350 keV transition to be \u03c9\u03b3 = 136 \u00b1 17 meV.\nDue to the occurrence of resonances in 18 O(\u03b1, n1 )21 Ne\nas well as in 17 O(\u03b1, n1 )20 Ne at this energy [18], the observed gamma spectrum contained many strong background and neutron-induced lines (see Fig. 3b) complicating the identification of resonant gamma-ray transitions. Comparison of the primary transition strengths\nwith their recommended upper limits [21] restrict the spin\nvalues of the resonant state to the range 7/2 to 11/2.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe reaction 17 O(\u03b1, \u03b3)21 Ne has been measured in the\nenergy range 750 keV to 1650 keV and three resonances\nhave been found. The lowest observed resonance is of\ncomparable strength in the \u03b3 and the neutron reaction\nchannels (\u03c9\u03b3\u03b3 = 7.6 \u00b1 0.9 meV vs. \u03c9\u03b3n = 4.2 \u00b1 2 meV\n[6]). This resonance is in the energy range of interest for\nCarbon shell burning and has a significant impact on the\nrelevant reaction rate.\nS process calculations used either the Caughlan-Fowler\nreaction rate for 17 O(\u03b1, \u03b3) [9] (CF88 hereafter) or a rate\nbased on a microscopic three-cluster model calculation\nby Descouvemont [10]. Since their results differ by up to\nfour orders of magnitude in the relevant energy regions\nnetwork calculations of the weak s process, especially for\nlow metallicity stars [5], could either produce significant\noverabundances of elements up to mass 90 with the higher\nCF88 rate or extend the element production into the A =\n150 region in case of a negligible neutron poisoning effect\nwhen using the reduced 17 O(\u03b1, \u03b3)21 Ne rate of Ref. [10].\nUsing only the three observed resonances from our\n\n\f5\nUnobserved resonances\nE\u03b1 = 1002 keV\nE\u03b1 = 1386 keV\nE\u03b1 = 1619 keV\n\nNA <\u03c3 v> [cm3 mol-1 s-1]\n\n102\n10\n1\n10-1\n10-2\n10-3\n10-4\n10-5\n10-6\n10-7\n10-8\n10-9\n10-10\n10-11\n10-12\n10-13\n10-14\n10-15 -1\n10\n\n1\nT [GK]\n\n10\n\nFIG. 4. (Color online) Stellar reaction rate from 0.2 GK to\n10 GK. The individual contributions from the three observed\nresonances and the sum of the unobserved states as an upper\nlimit are shown.\n\nexperiment a calculation of the stellar reaction rate of\nO(\u03b1, \u03b3)21 Ne around a temperature of 1 GK confirms\nthe CF88 estimates (at T = 1 GK: NA h\u03c3vi(present) =\n1.8 *10\u22122 and NA h\u03c3vi(CF 88) = 4.6 *10\u22122, in units of cm3\nmol\u22121 s\u22121 ) and excludes Descouvement's results. To obtain an upper limit of the reaction rate in this energy region one can assume that all unobserved states between\nEx = 7960 keV and 8465 keV exhibit resonances in the\n(\u03b1, \u03b3) channel with strengths just below our detection\nlimit. This was estimated to be 10\u221215 reactions per projectile, corresponding to upper limits for the strengths\nof possible resonances of 0.03 meV to 0.05 meV, depend17\n\n[1] L.-S. The, M.

Resonances at energies lower than covered in our\nmeasurement can further increase the rate. The contributions due to the individual observed resonances and\nthe upper limit from the unobserved ones are shown in\nFig. 4.\nTo cover both burning scenarios of relevance to the\nweak s process it is still necessary to extend the experimental data on the reaction 17 O(\u03b1, \u03b3)21 Ne towards lower\nenergies, if possible into the temperature range of core\nHelium burning around 0.3 GK. The results presented\nhere strongly suggest that the \u03b3-channel has a strength\nthat enables it to compete with the neutron channel,\nthereby limiting neutron recycling through the reaction\n17\nO(\u03b1, n)20 Ne and making 16 O a neutron poison in the s\nprocess in massive halo-metallicity stars. Since the critical value determining the element production is the ratio\nof the rates of the two competing reaction channels more\ndetailed stellar network calculations using the rate presented here also require the input of the 17 O(\u03b1, n)20 Ne\nreaction rate. We recently completed an improved measurement of this reaction and will present an in-depth\nastrophysical study considering our results for both reaction channels in a forthcoming publication [18].\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to the\ntechnical staff of the Nuclear Science Laboratory at Notre\nDame.
