INTRODUCTION\n\nDirect imaging surveys for resolved substellar companions are vital for studies of brown dwarfs and planets.\nThese surveys provide measurements of the frequency of\ncompanions as a function of various physical properties,\nsuch as primary mass, companion mass, separation, and\nage, which in turn can be used to constrain the mechanisms by which substellar companions form. In addition,\ncompared to their isolated counterparts, each newly uncovered companion represents a superior laboratory for\n1 Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802; kluhman@astro.psu.edu.\n2 Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden St.,\nCambridge, MA 02138.\n3 School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Minnesota,\nMinneapolis, MN 55455.\n4 Spitzer Science Center, Caltech MS 314-6, Pasadena, CA\n91125.\n5 Institute for Astronomy, The University of Hawaii at Manoa,\n2680 Woodlawn Drive, Honolulu, HI 96822.\n6 Visiting Astronomer at the Infrared Telescope Facility, which is\noperated by the University of Hawaii under Cooperative Agreement\nno.

Stars for which\nplanets have been discovered through radial velocity\nmonitoring and young nearby stars are particularly attractive categories to consider. Several direct imaging surveys have focused on known extrasolar planetary\nsystems (Luhman & Jayawardhana 2002; Patience et al.\n2002; Mugrauer et al. 2005; Chauvin et al. 2006), producing one companion that was initially described\nas a brown dwarf (Els et al. 2001) but later shown\nto be a white dwarf (Mugrauer & Neuh\u00e4user 2005;\nLagrange et al. 2006). Similar observations have been\nperformed toward young stars and brown dwarfs within\n100 pc of the Sun (\u03c4 \u223c 10-400 Myr, Chauvin et al.\n2003; Neuh\u00e4user et al. 2000a; McCarthy & Zuckerman\n2004; Lowrance et al. 2005), resulting in the discovery\nof several substellar companions that include G196-3 B\n(Rebolo et al. 1998), TWA 5 B (Lowrance et al. 1999;\nNeuh\u00e4user et al. 2000b), HR 7329 B (Lowrance et al.\n2000; Guenther et al. 2001), AB Pic B (Chauvin et al.\n2005b), HD 49197 B (Metchev & Hillenbrand 2004),\n2M 1207-3932 B (Chauvin et al. 2004, 2005a), and\nHD 203030 B (Metchev & Hillenbrand 2006).\nThe\nspectral types of these companions range from late M\nthrough L but do not extend into the cooler T types.\n\n\f2\n\nLuhman et al.\n\nThe only known T dwarf companions to stars consist\nof Gl 229 B (Nakajima et al. 1995; Oppenheimer et al.\n1995), Gl 570 D (Burgasser et al. 2000), Gl 337 D\n(Wilson et al. 2001; Burgasser et al. 2005), \u01eb Ind B and\nC (Scholz et al. 2003; McCaughrean et al. 2004), and\nSCR 1845 B (Biller et al. 2006), all of which orbit nearby\nstars that are older than \u223c 1 Gyr and have no known\nplanets.\nMost resolved substellar companions have been identified through deep, high-resolution imaging at small separations (\u03c1 . 10\u2032\u2032 ) with adaptive optics or the Hubble\nSpace Telescope or through shallow imaging at arbitrarily large separations with the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) or the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).\nBecause of its wide field of view (\u03c1 = 2.\u2032 5) and unprecedented sensitivity at mid-infrared (IR) wavelengths, the\nInfrared Array Camera (IRAC; Fazio et al. 2004) aboard\nthe Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al. 2004) complements these previous search methods by providing the\nbest available sensitivity to low-mass companions at separations of \u03c1 \u223c 10-100\u2032\u2032 (r \u223c 100-1000 AU) from nearby\nstars. To take advantage of these capabilities, we have\nobtained IRAC images of nearby young stars and planetbearing stars identified in radial velocity surveys. In this\npaper, we report the discovery of two T dwarf companions to stars in these samples, HN Peg (d = 18.4 pc,\nG0V) and HD 3651 (d = 11.1 pc, K0V) 11 . The former is a young solar analog (Gaidos 1998) while the\nlatter has a sub-Saturn planetary companion at 0.3 AU\n(Fischer et al. 2003; Fischer & Valenti 2005). We begin\nby describing the IRAC images that were used to identify the T dwarf companions to these stars (\u00a7 2.1) and\nfollowup near-IR photometry and spectroscopy (\u00a7 2.2).\nWe then assess the evidence of companionship (\u00a7 3.1),\nmeasure spectral types (\u00a7 3.2), and estimate the physical\nproperties of these companions (\u00a7 3.3). Finally, we discuss these newly discovered T dwarfs in the context of\npreviously known brown dwarfs (\u00a7 4).\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n2.1. Spitzer Mid-IR Imaging\n\nAs a part of the Guaranteed Time Observations of the\nIRAC instrument team, we obtained images at 3.6, 4.5,\n5.8, and 8.0 \u03bcm with IRAC aboard the Spitzer Space\nTelescope of 73 nearby young stars (PID=34) and 48\nknown extrasolar planetary systems (PID=48) between\nlate 2003 and early 2005. The plate scale and field of\nview of IRAC are 1.\u2032\u2032 2 and 5.\u2032 2 \u00d7 5.\u2032 2, respectively. The\ncamera produces images with FWHM= 1.\u2032\u2032 6-1.\u2032\u2032 9 from\n3.6 to 8.0 \u03bcm (Fazio et al. 2004). The observing strategy and image reduction procedures were the same as\nthose described by Patten et al. (2006a) for IRAC observations of M, L, and T dwarfs, except for the following\nmodifications (Patten et al. 2006b). The data were processed using the software suite \"IRACproc\" developed\nfor this program to facilitate the combining of dithered\nor mapped IRAC data and the rejection of cosmic-rays\n(Schuster et al. 2006). In order to obtain the best possible photometry of faint sources, we removed the light\nfrom each primary by fitting a scaled IRAC point spread\nfunction in each band that was derived from IRAC ob11 In a paper submitted after this one, Mugrauer et al. (2006)\nreported an independent discovery of the companion to HD 3651.\n\nservations of Vega, \u01eb Eri and \u01eb Ind A (Marengo et al.\n2006).\nWe measured photometry and astrometry of all point\nsources appearing in the reduced images of each star.\nWe then identified candidate T dwarf companions by\ncomparing these data to the colors of known T dwarfs\n(Patten et al. 2006a), which are highly distinctive from\nthose of other astronomical sources. We did not search\nfor M and L dwarf companions because their IRAC colors do not differ significantly from those of stars at earlier types. We also considered only candidates that had\nmagnitudes that were consistent with the absolute magnitudes of known T dwarfs when placed at the distance\nof the primary. These selection criteria were applied with\na statistical technique based on the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN, Fix & Hodge 1951), which is a nonparametric classifier appropriate when a physical model is not\navailable or is not reliable enough for fitting the data.\nWe adapted this data mining technique, commonly used\nin pattern recognition and unsupervised machine learning, to the case of astronomical photometric data. By\ndefining an appropriate metric in the color and magnitude multi-dimensional space, we determined a \"score\"\nfor each object, based on its \"distance\" from the colors\nand magnitudes of known T dwarfs. A full description\nof our technique is presented in Marengo & Sanchez (in\npreparation). The two candidates with the best scores\nappeared in the images of HN Peg and HD 3651. Their\npositions in the IRAC color-color and color-magnitude\ndiagrams are indicated Figs. 1 and 2 and their photometric measurements are listed in Table 1. No other objects\nhad scores that were comparable the ones for these two\ncandidates. Followup observations of these candidates\nare described in the next section.\nDuring a survey for debris disks with the Multiband\nImaging Photometer for Spitzer, Bryden et al. (2006) obtained 24 \u03bcm images of HN Peg. These data encompass\nthe candidate companion to this star that we have found\nwith IRAC. According to analysis that was kindly performed by G. Bryden, the candidate is not detected in\nthose 24 \u03bcm data. Extrapolating from the IRAC data\nwith a Rayleigh-Jeans distribution, the expected 24 \u03bcm\nflux from the candidate is \u223c 0.1 mJy while the noise in\nthe 24 \u03bcm image is about twice this value. These relatively shallow observations were designed to detect an\nexcess above the stellar photosphere of HN Peg rather\nthan a faint companion.\n2.2. IRTF Near-IR Imaging and Spectroscopy\n\nWe obtained near-IR spectra of the candidate T dwarf\ncompanions to HN Peg and HD 3651 with the spectrometer SpeX (Rayner et al. 2003) at the NASA Infrared\nTelescope Facility (IRTF) on the nights of 2006 June 15\nand 30. The instrument was operated in the prism mode\nwith a 0.\u2032\u2032 8 slit, producing a wavelength coverage of 0.82.5 \u03bcm and a resolution of R \u223c 100. For each candidate,\nwe obtained 20 exposures distributed between two positions along the slit. The individual exposure times were\n1.5 min, resulting in a total exposure time of 30 min for\neach object. The slit was aligned to the parallactic angle\nfor all observations. The spectra were reduced with the\nSpextool package (Cushing et al. 2004) and corrected for\ntelluric absorption (Vacca et al. 2003).\nWe also used the slit-viewing camera on SpeX to mea-\n\n\fT Dwarf Companions\nsure near-IR photometry for the candidate companions\non the night of 2006 July 2. The camera contained a\n512 \u00d7 512 Aladdin 2 InSb array and had a plate scale\nof 0.\u2032\u2032 12 pixel\u22121 (Rayner et al. 2003). Imaging was performed through Mauna Kea Observatory (MKO) J, H,\nand K filters (Simons & Tokunaga 2002; Tokunaga et al.\n2002; Tokunaga & Vacca 2005). In each filter, we obtained one 30 s exposure at each of nine dithered positions. For the K-band imaging of the candidate companion to HD 3651, we performed this cycle twice. Images\nfor a given candidate and filter were median combined to\nproduce a flat field image, which was then divided into\nthe original exposures. Point sources in these images\nexhibited FWHM= 0.\u2032\u2032 8. We extracted photometry for\neach candidate companion with the task PHOT under\nthe IRAF package APPHOT using a radius of eight pixels. These data were calibrated with images of standard\nstars for the MKO system (Leggett et al. 2006). The J,\nH, and K measurements for the two candidate companions are presented in Table 1.\n3. ANALYSIS\n3.1. Evidence of Binarity\nWhen a candidate companion is identified in direct\nimaging of a star in the solar neighborhood, the standard method of definitively assessing its status as a binary companion consists of checking whether it shares\nthe same proper motion as the primary. To apply this\nmethod to the two candidate T dwarfs from our IRAC\nimages of HN Peg and HD 3651, we needed an image\nof each object obtained at a second epoch. The candidate companion to HN Peg was detected in each of the\nthree 2MASS bands and appears in the 2MASS Point\nSource Catalog. The candidate near HD 3651 is not in\nthe 2MASS Point Source Catalog, but through visual inspection of the images, we find that it was detected in J\nand H.\nTo measure the proper motion of each candidate, we\nidentified sources that appear in both the IRAC and\nthe 2MASS images and measured their right ascensions\nand declinations in the 4.5 \u03bcm image of IRAC and in\nthe 2MASS band in which the candidate companion has\nthe highest signal-to-noise ratio (H for HN Peg and\nJ for HD 3651). The differences between the IRAC\nand 2MASS coordinates for these objects are plotted in\nFigs. 3 and 4. The relatively small number of stars in\neach diagram is a reflection of the requirement of a detection by 2MASS; the numbers of sources detected by\nthe IRAC images are much larger. To correct for a small\noffset between the coordinate systems of the IRAC and\n2MASS images, we applied constant shifts to the right\nascension and declination differences so that their average values were zero. In other words, we assume that the\naverage proper motion of stars surrounding each star is\nzero. For comparison, we include in Figs. 3 and 4 the\nexpected displacements of HN Peg and HD 3651 during\nthe time interval between the 2MASS and IRAC observations (\u2206\u03c4 = 5.7 and 6.8 years) based on their known\nproper motions (Perryman et al. 1997). In each of the\ntwo diagrams, one source exhibits a motion that is significantly non-zero and that is consistent with the expected\nmotion of the primary. These two objects are the candidate T dwarfs that we found with IRAC. Thus, these\ndata demonstrate that both candidates have common\n\n3\n\nproper motions with the primaries, which conclusively\nestablishes their companionship. Hereafter in this paper, we refer to these new companions as HN Peg B and\nHD 3651 B12 . The positions of HN Peg B and HD 3651 B\nrelative to their primaries are listed in Table 1. 2MASS\nand IRAC images of these systems are shown in Figs. 5\nand 6.\n3.2. Spectral Classification\n\nIn \u00a7 2.1, we identified HN Peg B and HD 3651 B as\npossible T dwarfs based on their mid-IR colors and magnitudes. As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, our near-IR spectra\nof both companions exhibit methane absorption, which\nis the defining spectral feature of T dwarfs (Kirkpatrick\n2005). To measure the precise spectral type of each\ncompanion, we visually compared these spectra to the\nSpeX data for T dwarf standards that were presented by\nBurgasser et al. (2006b). In Figure 7, we find that the\nspectrum of HN Peg B agrees well with the average of the\nspectra of SDSS 1254-0122 (T2) and 2MASS 1209-1004\n(T3). The match is clearly worse with either of these\nstandards alone. Therefore, we assign a spectral type of\nT2.5\u00b10.5 to HN Peg B.\nAlthough the overall spectrum of HN Peg B is fit\nwell with standard T dwarfs, the K I absorption lines\nat 1.25 \u03bcm appear to be weaker in HN Peg B than\nin the standards. In comparison, these lines become\nweaker with lower gravity for late-M and early-L dwarfs\n(McGovern et al. 2004; Kirkpatrick et al. 2006) but grow\nstronger with lower gravity at late-T types (Knapp et al.\n2004). Based on the apparent youth of its primary\n(\u00a7 3.3.1), HN Peg B should have a lower surface gravity than the standard T dwarfs in Figure 7. Thus, these\ndata for HN Peg B seem to indicate that the gravity dependence of the K I lines is the same in early T dwarfs as\nit is in M and L dwarfs. However, because the spectral\nresolution of our data is too low for reliable measurements of these lines, a spectrum at higher resolution is\nneeded to explore this issue definitively.\nIn Figure 8, we compare HD 3651 B to\n2MASS 0727+1710 (T7) and 2MASS 0415-0935 (T8)\nand the average of the two standards. The differences\nbetween HD 3651 B and each of these three spectra\nare subtle, but close examination of each comparison\nindicates that the average of T7 and T8 provides the\nbest match to HD 3651. For instance, the width of the\ncontinuum at 1.2-1.3 \u03bcm, the depth of the absorption at\n1.6-1.8 \u03bcm, and the level of the K-band flux are all best\nfit by the average of T7 and T8. Therefore, we measure\na spectral type of T7.5\u00b10.5 for HD 3651 B.\n3.3. Physical Properties\n3.3.1. Age and Distance\n\nNow that HN Peg B and HD 3651 B have been confirmed as companion T dwarfs, we examine their physical properties. Because these T dwarfs are companions, we can assign to them the ages and distances of\ntheir primaries, which are bright, well-studied stars in\nthe solar neighborhood. As a result, the ages and distances of these T dwarfs, and hence the masses, radii,\n12 The planetary companion to HD 3651 from Fischer et al.\n(2003) is designated with a lowercase \"b\" based on the naming\nconvention for planets from radial velocity surveys.\n\n\f4\n\nLuhman et al.\n\nand temperatures, are better constrained than those of\nisolated T dwarfs. We adopt the Hipparcos trigonometric distances of 18.4 \u00b1 0.3 and 11.1 \u00b1 0.1 pc for\nHN Peg A and HD 3651 A, respectively (Perryman et al.\n1997). HN Peg A appears to be a young solar analog based on its activity, X-ray emission, rotation, Li\nabundance, and kinematics (Gaidos 1998). A comparison of the Li measurements for HN Peg A (Chen et al.\n2001) to Li data for solar-type members of the Pleiades\nand Hyades open clusters and the Ursa Major moving\ngroup (Soderblom et al. 1990, 1993a,b) indicates that\nHN Peg A is probably older than the Pleiades (\u03c4 = 100125 Myr, Meynet et al. 1993; Stauffer et al. 1998) and\nyounger than Ursa Major (\u03c4 = 400-600 Myr, King et al.\n2003) and the Hyades (\u03c4 = 575-675 Myr, Perryman et al.\n1998). A comparison of the rotational properties of\nHN Peg A (P=4-5 d, v sin i\u223c 10 km s\u22121 , e.g.,\nK\u00f6nig et al. 2006; Nordstrom et al. 2004) and these open\nclusters (Radick et al. 1987; Soderblom et al. 1993c;\nSoderblom & Mayor 1993) produces the same result.\nThe chromospheric activity of HN Peg A suggests an\nage of \u223c 0.3-0.4 Gyr (Gaidos 1998; Rocha-Pinto et al.\n2004). A debris disk was recently detected around\nHN Peg A at 30 and 70 \u03bcm by the Spitzer Space Telescope\n(Bryden et al. 2006; Beichman et al. 2006), which tends\nto further support the youth of this star. Meanwhile,\nHD 3651 is probably older than the Sun considering its\nfairly long rotational period (P=48 d, Noyes et al. 1984).\nWright et al. (2004) estimated an age of 5.9 Gyr from its\nchromospheric activity and Valenti & Fischer (2005) reported an isochronal age of 8.2+4.3\n\u22125.2 Gyr. Based on these\nage constraints, we adopt ages of 0.3 \u00b1 0.2 and 7 \u00b1 3 Gyr\nfor the HN Peg and HD 3651 systems, respectively.\n3.3.2. Luminosity\n\nTo measure the bolometric luminosities of HN Peg B\nand HD 3651 B, we first used the JHK photometry to\nflux calibrate the 0.8-2.5 \u03bcm spectra. For each object,\nwe constructed a spectral energy distribution that consisted of these calibrated spectra, the IRAC photometry (3.2-9.2 \u03bcm), a linear interpolation of the fluxes between 2.5 \u03bcm and 3.2 \u03bcm, and a Rayleigh-Jeans distribution longward of 9.2 \u03bcm. By summing the flux in\neach distribution and correcting for distance, we measured log L/L\u2299 = \u22124.77 \u00b1 0.03 and \u22125.60 \u00b1 0.05 for\nHN Peg B and HD 3651 B, respectively.\nOur luminosity measurement for HN Peg B is greater\nthan the value produced by combining its K magnitude\nwith the bolometric corrections (BCK ) that have been\npreviously measured for T2-T3 dwarfs (Golimowski et al.\n2004). For instance, the bolometric luminosity for the T2\ndwarf SDSS 1254-0122 from Cushing et al. (2006) implies BCK = 3.04. If we combine this value of BCK\nwith our K measurement for HN Peg B and an absolute bolometric magnitude for the Sun of Mbol\u2299 = 4.75,\nwe arrive at log L/L\u2299 = \u22124.83. To explore the source\nof the difference in these two luminosity estimates, we\ncompare in Figure 9 the near- and mid-IR colors of\nHN Peg B to colors of T dwarfs compiled by Patten et al.\n(2006a). The 2MASS measurements from Patten et al.\n(2006a) have been transformed to the MKO system\n(Stephens & Leggett 2004). In the diagrams of colors\nversus spectral type in Figure 9, HN Peg B is similar to\nother T dwarfs near its spectral type in terms of J \u2212 H,\n\nH \u2212 K, [3.6] \u2212 [4.5], and [4.5] \u2212 [5.8], but it is redder\nby \u223c 0.3 and \u223c 0.15 mag in K \u2212 [4.5] and [5.8] \u2212 [8.0],\nrespectively. The latter difference is not significant because of the large photometric error in [8.0]. However,\nHN Peg B clearly has redder JHK\u2212IRAC colors relative\nto typical field dwarfs, which explains why the luminosity derived from K and BCK was lower than the value\nmeasured from the photometry and spectra. In other\nwords, if we reduced the IRAC fluxes of HN Peg B by\n\u223c 30% so that its JHK\u2212IRAC colors were consistent\nwith those of other T2-T3 dwarfs like SDSS 1254-0122,\nthen our luminosity measurement would agree with the\none based on K and BCK .\nOur luminosity measurement for HD 3651 B agrees\nwell with the value produced by combining its K magnitude with BCK for T7-T8 dwarfs from Golimowski et al.\n(2004). In addition, the near- and mid-IR colors of\nHD 3651 B are consistent with those of the other T\ndwarfs shown in Figure 9.\n3.3.3. Mass, Radius, and Temperature\n\nWe use theoretical evolutionary models to convert\nour luminosity and age estimates for HN Peg B and\nHD 3651 B to masses, effective temperatures, and radii.\nWe perform this conversion by plotting these companions\non diagrams of luminosity versus age and comparing their\npositions to lines of constant mass, temperature, and radius that are predicted by evolutionary models. These\ndiagrams are presented in Figs. 10 and 11 with the models of Burrows et al. (1997) and Baraffe et al. (2003), respectively, which imply nearly identical physical properties. The models produce M = 0.021 \u00b1 0.009 M\u2299 ,\nR = 0.108+0.014\n\u22120.006 R\u2299 , and Teff = 1130\u00b170 K for HN Peg B\nand M = 0.051 \u00b1 0.014 M\u2299 , R = 0.082 \u00b1 0.006 R\u2299 , and\nTeff = 810 \u00b1 50 K for HD 3651 B. The spectral types\nand physical properties of HN Peg B and HD 3651 B are\nsummarized in Table 2.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nWe have presented the discovery of two T dwarf companions in the solar neighborhood, HN Peg B (T2.5) and\nHD 3651 B (T7.5). These T dwarfs are the sixth and seventh known T dwarf companions to stars and are the first\nT dwarfs discovered with the Spitzer Space Telescope. In\nthis section, we describe additional notable aspects of\nthese new brown dwarfs.\nHN Peg A has been the target of high-precision\nradial velocity monitoring (Cummings et al. 1999;\nFischer & Valenti 2005; K\u00f6nig et al. 2006) and near-IR\ncoronographic imaging (McCarthy & Zuckerman 2004),\nbut no companions have been found through those observations. HN Peg B was bright enough to be detected\nby the imaging of McCarthy & Zuckerman (2004), but it\nwas outside of their field of view (r < 15\u2032\u2032 ). This companion was also beyond the field of view of unpublished images of HN Peg obtained with the Near-Infrared Camera\nand Multi-Object Spectrometer aboard the Hubble Space\nTelescope during General Observer program 10176. Various data from the literature indicate that HN Peg A has\nan age of 0.1-0.5 Gyr (\u00a7 3.3.1). If the T dwarf S Ori 70\n(Zapatero Osorio et al. 2002) is a field dwarf rather than\na member of the young cluster \u03c3 Ori (Burgasser et al.\n2004), then HN Peg B may be the youngest known T\n\n\fT Dwarf Companions\ndwarf. HN Peg B closely resembles the recently discovered late-L companion to HD 203030 in terms of age and\nmass (Metchev & Hillenbrand 2006).\nSeveral properties of HN Peg B do not behave in the\nmanner predicted for young, low-gravity T dwarfs. Although the colors within the JHK bands and within\nthe IRAC bands are normal, all colors containing one of\nthe former and one of the latter are redder than those\nof typical T dwarfs by \u223c 0.3 mag (\u00a7 3.3.2). In contrast, low gravity should cause these colors to become\nbluer, not redder, according to the theoretical spectra\nof Burrows et al. (2006). Based on its position in colormagnitude diagrams, HN Peg B is probably not an equalcomponent binary, but it could be a binary with two\nunequal components13 . Because later T dwarfs emit\nproportionately more flux in the mid-IR bands than at\nshorter wavelengths, an unresolved system of this kind\n(e.g., T1+T5) might be responsible for these anomalous\ncolors. Another possible explanation is photometric variability between the dates of the IRAC and JHK observations (Burgasser et al. 2002; Enoch et al. 2003).\nOur estimates of the stellar parameters of HN Peg B\nalso exhibit peculiarities. When we compare the luminosity and age of HN Peg B to the predictions of theoretical\nevolutionary models, we derive an effective temperature\nof 1130 \u00b1 70 K, which is lower than the values previously measured for T dwarfs at T2-T3 (Teff \u223c 1400 K,\nGolimowski et al. 2004). In contrast, the spectral modeling of late T dwarfs by Burgasser et al. (2006b) found\nthat temperature should increase rather than decrease\nwith lower gravity at a given spectral type. If this prediction is combined with the models shown in Figs. 10\nand 11, then a young T dwarf should be much brighter\nthan an older one at the same spectral type. Instead, we\nfind that HN Peg B is at the faint end of T0-T4 dwarfs\n(Golimowski et al. 2004) and is at least one magnitude\nfainter in bolometric luminosity than expected for its assumed age. One possible explanation for these discrepancies is that the HN Peg system is much older than various\ndata for the primary seem to indicate (\u00a7 3.3.1). However,\nMetchev & Hillenbrand (2006) have recently reported\nthe same anomalous behavior for a late-L companion\nnear another star that appears to be young, HD 203030,\nand it seems unlikely that the age estimates for both stars\nhave such large errors. Instead, the presence of this phenomenon in both HN Peg B and HD 203030 B strongly\nindicates that the temperature of the L/T transition is\ndependent on surface gravity, and in a manner that has\nnot been previously predicted.\nWhen combined with the evolutionary models, the\n13 One of the T dwarfs that has been unresolved in previous imaging, 2M 0559-1404 (Burgasser et al. 2003), is overluminous in Figure 2, which suggests that it could be a binary. This\nbrown dwarf was identified as a possible binary because of its\nbright J magnitude relative to late L dwarfs (Dahn et al. 2002),\n\n5\n\nluminosity and age of HN Peg B translate to a mass\n0.021 \u00b1 0.009 M\u2299 , making it one of the least massive\nknown T dwarfs. In addition, like HD 203030 B (M =\n0.023 M\u2299 Metchev & Hillenbrand 2006), HN Peg B is\namong the least massive known brown dwarf companions and is a more evolved counterpart to the widelyseparated companions DH Tau B (\u03c4 \u223c 1 Myr, Itoh et al.\n2005), CHXR 73 B (\u03c4 \u223c 2 Myr, Luhman et al. 2006),\nand AB Pic B (\u03c4 \u223c 30 Myr, Chauvin et al. 2005b), which\nhave masses of 0.01-0.02 M\u2299 (Luhman et al. 2006).\nFor HD 3651, radial velocity monitoring has uncovered a sub-Saturn-mass planet at 0.3 AU (Fischer et al.\n2003; Fischer & Valenti 2005) while no companions have\nbeen identified in adaptive optics images (Carson et al.\n2005). The latter observations did not detect HD 3651 B\nbecause their field of view was too small (r < 15\u2032\u2032 ).\nTakeda et al. (2006) suggested that the high eccentricities of planets in old, single-planet systems like HD 3651\nmight be caused by secular perturbations from distant\nlow-mass companions, and indeed we have found such a\ncompanion in the form of HD 3651 B. This T dwarf is the\nfirst resolved substellar companion that has been discovered in one of the extrasolar planetary systems identified\nin radial velocity surveys. Like HN Peg B, HD 3651 B is\nprobably not an equal-magnitude binary brown dwarf according to its position in the color-magnitude diagram in\nFigure 2. HD 3651 B is a virtual twin to another T dwarf\ncompanion, Gl 570 D, in terms of spectral type, luminosity, mass, temperature, and radius (Burgasser et al.\n2000; Geballe et al. 2001). As with Gl 570 D, these measurements have relatively high accuracy because of the\ncompanionship of HD 3651 B to a nearby, well-studied\nstar, making it a valuable brown dwarf for calibrating\nmethods of characterizing the physical properties of late\nT dwarfs (Burgasser et al. 2006a).\n\nWe thank Eric Mamajek for discussions regarding the\nages of HN Peg and HD 3651 and Adam Burgasser for\nproviding his spectra of T dwarf standards. We are also\ngrateful to Geoff Bryden for checking his 24 \u03bcm images\nof HN Peg for a detection of the companion. K.

Support for the IRAC instrument was provided by NASA through contract 960541 issued by JPL.\nbut more recent 1-5 \u03bcm measurements indicated that it might\nnot be significantly overluminous compared to other T dwarfs\n(Golimowski et al. 2004; Vrba et al. 2004).\n\nREFERENCES\nAllard, F., Hauschildt, P.

The absolute magnitudes of the\ncandidates have been computed by adopting the distances of the primaries. The magnitudes and colors of these candidate companions are\nindicative of T dwarfs. Unlike known T dwarf binaries (Burgasser et al. 2006c, references therein), HN Peg and HD 3651 are near the lower\nenvelope of the T dwarf sequence, indicating that they are probably not equal-component binaries.\n\n\fT Dwarf Companions\n\n9\n\nFig. 3.- Differences in coordinates of sources near HN Peg between an H-band 2MASS image obtained in 1998 and a 4.5 \u03bcm IRAC\nimage obtained in 2004 (filled circles). The expected proper motion of HN Peg during this time interval is indicated (circle, Perryman et al.\n1997). Excluding the candidate T dwarf companion from Figs. 1 and 2 (rightmost filled circle), the standard deviations of the offsets are\n\u03c3RA = 0.\u2032\u2032 19 and \u03c3Dec = 0.\u2032\u2032 20, which represent the errors in these measurements. The candidate T dwarf exhibits a proper motion that is\nnon-zero at a level of 8.8 \u03c3RA and 2.2 \u03c3Dec and is consistent with that of HN Peg at a level of 1.8 \u03c3RA and 1.0 \u03c3Dec , demonstrating that\nit is a companion.\n\n\f10\n\nLuhman et al.\n\nFig. 4.- Differences in coordinates of sources near HD 3651 between a J-band 2MASS image obtained in 1997 and a 4.5 \u03bcm IRAC image\nobtained in 2004 (filled circles).
