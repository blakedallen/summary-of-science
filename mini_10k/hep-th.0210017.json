It began in the mid-seventies, when\nBekenstein [1] and Hawking [2] formulated a convincing analogy between\nblack hole mechanics and the laws that govern a thermodynamic system.\nHawking dramatically punctuated this analogy with his demonstration that\nblack holes emit thermal radiation (via a quantum tunneling mechanism) at\na temperature that complies perfectly with the value predicted by the first\nlaw [3].\nThere has since been an \"endless\" series of research papers that have\nexamined black hole thermodynamics from a myriad of different angles [4].\nThe motivation to study black holes has stemmed from several sources; for\ninstance, their likely existence as astronomical objects, the role of microscopic\nholes in the primordial universe, as well as simple aesthetic interest. However,\nthe most compelling motivating factor might be in the context of quantum\ngravity, where black holes have served as a particularly useful testing ground\nfor theoretical frameworks and ideas. In this regard, black hole entropy\noccupies a very esteemed position, as it is often argued that any viable theory\nof quantum gravity must naturally incorporate and ultimately explain the\nBekenstein-Hawking area law [1, 2].\nThis important role of black hole entropy also serves to magnify the conceptual difficulties that it unfortunately presents. Most significantly, the\ninformation loss paradox [5], the breakdown of quantum field theory (or,\nequivalently, the holographic storage of information [6]), and the statistical\norigin of the entropy in question [7]. That is not to say there has been a\nlack of progress in answering these questions; if anything, there has been too\nmuch! For instance, various microstate-counting frameworks have successfully reproduced the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy; including those with their\norigins in string theory [8], quantum geometry [9], Sakharov's induced gravity [10], Chern-Simons theory [11], asymptotic conformal symmetries [12],\netcetera. It is, however, conspicuously unclear as to how these various techniques are related and, moreover, as to what degrees of freedom are truly\nbeing counted. Without some fundamental theory that ties this altogether,\nthe statistical origin of the entropy remains as enigmatic as ever.\nIt should be evident that we need to better our understanding of black\nhole entropy; however, it remains quite unclear as to how substantial progress\n2\n\n\fcan be made. One possible direction, which has enjoyed success in the past,\nis to investigate theoretical models of two-dimensional gravity [13, 14]. Such\nmodels allow one to focus directly on the essence of the physical issues,\nwithout being bogged down by the calculational complexities inherent to\nhigher-dimensional theories.\nAlthough the physical significance of two-dimensional gravity can, in general, be challenged, there are many specific instances where a given model\nis directly related to a physically relevant theory. As an example, let us\nconsider Jackiw-Teitelboim theory [15], which describes constant-curvature\nblack hole solutions in two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. This model\nhappens to have a dual relationship with certain string-inspired black holes\n[16] and the near-extremal sector of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole [17].\nMoreover, the Jackiw-Teitelboim model can also be viewed as a dimensionally\nreduced form of the always topical BTZ black hole [18, 19].\nWith the above discussion in mind, the current paper considers the black\nhole thermodynamics of a general model of 1+1-dimensional gravity coupled to a dilatonic scalar field. One of the principal achievements will be\nthe formulation of a Lorentzian partition function, which is inspired by the\nHamiltonian thermodynamic analysis of Kuchar [20] and others (for instance,\n[21, 22, 23]). To express the partition function in a suitable form for explicit\nanalysis, we also call upon some other intriguing facets of black hole quantum\ntheory; including spectroscopy [24], complementarity [25] and spacetime Euclideanization [26]. In this sense, our formalism provides a simplified (lowerdimensional) framework for illustrating some of the essentials of black hole\nphysics.\nOur ultimate objective will be to evaluate the black hole entropy, including the leading-order quantum correction to the classical thermodynamic\nvalue. In this regard, it is interesting to take note of a related work by the\ncurrent author [27]. This recent paper considered the quantum-corrected entropy for precisely the same two-dimensional model. However, the approach\nof [27] was very much different from that of the present treatment. In fact,\n[27] was based on two distinct analytic methods for calculating the entropy;\nwith these being as follows:\nFirstly, we employed a formula that was derived by Das et al [28] and\nfollows from purely thermodynamic principles. Secondly, we applied Carlip's\n\n3\n\n\fquantum-corrected version [29] of the renowned Cardy formula [30].1\nFor both of these prior methods, the leading-order correction was shown\nto be proportional to the logarithm of the classical entropy. This outcome\nis in agreement with various calculations that are found in the literature;\nfor instance, in the quantum-geometry analysis of Kaul and Majumdar [32].\n(Also see, for example, [33]-[37],[29],[38]-[41], [28], [42], [43].) However, there\nwas also a notable discrepancy between the two methods of [27]: the statistical (i.e., Cardy) approach consistently yields a logarithmic prefactor of\n\u22123/2, whereas the thermodynamic treatment generates a model-dependent\nprefactor. Interestingly, the two prefactors are only in agreement for the very\nspecial case of Jackiw-Teitelboim theory [15].\nIt should be noted that a logarithmic prefactor of \u22123/2 coincides precisely\nwith the value prescribed by quantum geometry [32]. This particular value\nturns up elsewhere in the literature, although not exclusively so. For instance,\na four-dimensional study that is close in spirit to the current two-dimensional\nanalysis found a logarithmic prefactor of +1/2 [36]. One might anticipate\nthat the same outcome will be found here; but, as always in physics, there\ncan be no substitute for an explicit check.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we\nintroduce a generic model of 1+1-dimensional gravity with coupling to a\nscalar field. We then go on to discuss the black hole solutions and associated\nthermodynamics at the classical level. In Section 3, we consider a Lorentzian\npartition function for the 1+1-dimensional black hole of interest. With the\nhelp of Hamiltonian thermodynamics and black hole spectroscopy, we are able\nto express the partition function in a convenient form for explicit analysis.\nIn Section 4, we use the prior derivation as the basis for a calculation of\nthe black hole entropy. With the assumption of a semi-classical regime,\nwe are able to express the entropy in terms of a well-defined perturbative\nexpansion. Section 5 contains a summary and overview. In particular, we\ndirectly compare the current results with the findings from our prior study.\n1\n\nIn using the Cardy-Carlip formula, we first demonstrated that the near-horizon geometry of the generic theory can be effectively described by a conformal field theory.\nMoreover, this conformal theory was shown to have an identifiable Virasoro algebra. This\nportion of the analysis generalized a treatment by Solodukhin [31].\n\n4\n\n\f2\n\nGeneric Dilaton Gravity\n\nLet us begin by considering a 1+1-dimensional theory of gravity coupled to\na dilaton (or auxiliary scalar) field.2 Assuming a diffeomorphism invariant\naction that contains at most second derivatives of the fields, we have:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 Z 2 \u221a\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n1\nd x \u2212g D(\u03c6)R(g) + g \u2207\u03bc \u03c6\u2207\u03bd \u03c6 + 2 U(\u03c6) .\nI=\n2G\n2\nl\n\n(1)\n\nHere, G is a dimensionless measure of gravitational coupling (i.e., the twodimensional \"Newton constant\"), l is a fundamental constant of dimension\nlength, while D(\u03c6) and U(\u03c6) are well-behaved but otherwise arbitrary functions of the dilaton field. It is a point of interest that the very same action\ncan also describe dilaton-gravity coupled to an Abelian gauge field.3\nThe viewpoint of this paper will be that Eq.(1) represents some sort of\nfundamental theory. Nevertheless, it is worth noting the above action can\noften have physical significance from the perspective of higher-dimensional\n2\ntheories. For instance, one finds that D = \u03c6 /4 and U = 1 after the spherical\nreduction of 3+1-dimensional Einstein gravity [46]. Furthermore, many twodimensional theories have near-horizon dualities with either near-extremal\nblack holes [17] or string-theoretical models [47].\nExploiting conformal symmetry, one can conveniently reformulate the\naction so that the kinetic term is eliminated. This task can, in fact, be\naccomplished by way of the following field redefinitions [48]:\n(2)\n\n\u03c6 = D(\u03c6),\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a92 (\u03c6)g \u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n\n\u03a9 (\u03c6) =\n\n\uf8ee\n\nexp \uf8f0\n\n1Z\n2\n\nV (\u03c6) =\n\n\u03c6\n\nd\u03be\n\n!\u22121 \uf8f9\ndD\n\uf8fb,\n\nU(\u03c6)\n.\n\u03a92 (\u03c6)\n\nd\u03be\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\n2\nThe dilaton is a necessary element, inasmuch as the Einstein tensor identically vanishes\nfor two-dimensional gravity.\n3\nAssuming a gauge-invariant action, one finds that the Abelian sector can be exactly\nsolved in terms of the dilaton and a conserved charge [44, 45]. Hence, the total action can\nalways be re-expressed in the form of Eq.(1).\n\n5\n\n\fIn the above usage, it is implicit that D(\u03c6) and its derivative are nonvanishing throughout the relevant manifold.\nIn its reparametrized form, the action (1) simplifies as follows:\n1\nI=\n2G\n\n\u0015\n\u221a \u0014\n1\nd x \u2212g \u03c6R(g) + 2 V (\u03c6) .\nl\n\nZ\n\n2\n\n(6)\n\nThe field equations of this reparametrized action can readily be solved.\nMoreover, for the submanifold x \u2265 0, this solution can be conveniently expressed in a static, \"Schwarzschild-like\" gauge [49, 44]:\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(x) =\n\nx\nl\n\n\u2265 0,\n\n(7)\n\nds2 = \u2212 (J(\u03c6) \u2212 2lGM) dt2 + (J(\u03c6) \u2212 2lGM)\u22121 dx2 ,\nJ(\u03c6) =\n\nZ\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c6\n\nd\u03beV (\u03be),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere M is a constant of integration. We will regard M as being nonnegative; in which case, it can be identified with the conserved mass of a\nblack hole solution (if such a solution exists).\nIn the analysis to follow, we will assume that the theory always admits\nblack hole solutions for which the outermost horizon, \u03c6o = xo /l, is nondegenerate.4 In very general terms, a black hole horizon can be identified\nwith a hypersurface of vanishing Killing vector [51]. For the model under\nconsideration, this identification translates into the following relation [52, 49]:\nJ(\u03c6o ) \u2212 2lGM = 0.\n\n(10)\n\nAlternatively, one can write:\n\u03c6o = J \u22121 (2lGM).\n\n(11)\n\nNext, let us consider the tree-level black hole thermodynamics. It is\npertinent to this discussion that all thermodynamic properties of current\ninterest are invariant under the above reparametrization [53]. Firstly, we can\ncalculate the Hawking temperature (To ) via the usual Euclidean prescription\n4\n\nIt is sufficient criteria for a black hole solution if J(\u03c6) \u2212 2lGM has a zero and\nin the relevant manifold (\u03c6 \u2265 0). For a more rigorous discussion, see [50].\n\n6\n\ndJ\nd\u03c6\n\n>0\n\n\f[26]; that is, the inverse temperature is identified with the periodicity of\nimaginary time. One readily finds that:\nTo =\n\n1 dJ\n4\u03c0l d\u03c6\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\n\u03c6o\n\nGiven a two-dimensional spacetime, there is no obvious way of defining\nthe area of a one-dimensional surface, such as the horizon area of a black\nhole. For this reason, the Bekenstein-Hawking area law [1, 2] can not be\nexploited in a straightforward manner. Nonetheless, we can still ascertain the\nthermodynamic entropy (So ) by virtue of the first law of thermodynamics:\ndM|horizon = To dSo . Integration of this expression yields:\nSo =\n\n2\u03c0\n\u03c6o ,\nG\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the arbitrary constant has been set to zero in accordance with the\nusual convention. Working backwards from this result, we can now define an\neffective horizon \"area\" as follows:\nAo = 4GSo = 8\u03c0\u03c6o .\n\n(14)\n\nHere, we have simply applied the standard Bekenstein-Hawking definition.\nSo far, we have treated the dilaton potential, U(\u03c6) or V (\u03c6), as generically\nas possible. However, for illustrative purposes, it will often prove to be instructive and convenient if this potential is given an explicit form. Following\nour prior, related work [27], we thus consider a \"power-law\" potential:\nV (\u03c6) = \u03b3\u03c6a ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere a and \u03b3 are dimensionless, non-negative, model-dependent parameters. Interestingly, this form of potential can describe a Weyl-rescaled CGHS\nmodel (for a = 0 and \u03b3 = 1) [54, 55], or a dimensionally reduced BTZ black\nhole (for a = 1 and \u03b3 = 2) [18, 19]. On a more general note, such a potential\ncan capably describe (after suitable rescalings) the near-horizon geometry\nof a single-charged dilatonic black hole, a multi-charged stringy black hole,\nor a dilatonic p-brane [47]. Also, if a is allowed to be less than zero, than\nthis potential can describe the spherical reduction of d-dimensional Einstein\ngravity (for a = \u22121/(d \u2212 2) and \u03b3 = (d \u2212 3)/(d \u2212 2) [23]). A negative value of\n7\n\n\fa, however, somewhat complicates the later analysis.5 Hence, we will generally enforce a \u2265 0 and comment further on this restriction at an appropriate\npoint.\nGiven the power-law form of the potential (15), it is useful to note that\n(cf. Eqs.(9,11)):\n\u03b3\n\u03c6a+1 ,\n(16)\nJ(\u03c6) =\na+1\n\"\n\na+1\n\u03c6o =\n2lGM\n\u03b3\n\n#\n\n1\na+1\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nWe can also re-express the black hole mass (10) and temperature (12) as\nfollows:\n\u03b3\n1\n\u03c6a+1\n,\n(18)\nM=\n2lG a + 1 o\n\u03b3 a\nTo =\n\u03c6 ,\n(19)\n4\u03c0l o\nwhereas the entropy only depends implicitly (through \u03c6o ) on the specific\nchoice of model.\n\n3\n\nHamiltonian Partition Function\n\nIn this section, we will consider the Lorentzian partition function for a 1+1dimensional (dilatonic) black hole. Formally speaking, this partition function\ncan be defined as follows:\nh\n\ni\n\nZ[\u03b2, \u03c6+ ] = T r exp(\u2212\u03b2 \u0124) .\n\n(20)\n\nHere, \u03c6+ is the fixed value of the dilaton at a timelike outer boundary of the\nsystem, \u03b2 \u22121 is the equilibrium temperature of the system (as measured at\nthe outer boundary), \u0124 is the Lorentzian Hamiltonian operator (discussed\nbelow), and the trace is over all physically relevant states.\nThe premise of the above formulation is that a black hole can be viewed\nas thermodynamic object in a heat bath of fixed temperature \u03b2 \u22121 [26]. It\nis implied that the entire system has been enclosed in a thermally reflective\n5\nThis complication can be viewed as a manifestation of such theories admitting black\nholes with a negative specific heat. The very same problem, of course, notoriously afflicts\nthe Schwarzschild black hole.\n\n8\n\n\f\"box\"; thus ensuring that equilibrium is maintained.6 The above partition\nfunction then appropriately describes the thermodynamics of a canonical\nensemble [56].\nThe ultimate form of the Hamiltonian operator, \u0124, will depend on how\none chooses to define and then foliate the accessible spacetime [22]. For\nexample, previously in a 1+1-dimensional context [45], Kunstatter and the\ncurrent author chose boundary conditions that generalized the spherically\nsymmetric (four-dimensional) formalism of Louko and Whiting [21]. Technically speaking, the spacetime was foliated, from the black hole horizon to the\nsurface of the box, into spacelike hypersurfaces. Moreover, each of these spatial slices was constrained to approach the bifurcation point (i.e., the horizon\npoint of vanishing Killing vector) along a static slice. These boundary conditions are a natural choice from a thermodynamic perspective, inasmuch as\nthe resulting spacetime can be analytically continued to the Euclidean (black\nhole) instanton [26].\nWith these specified conditions, the Lorentzian Hamiltonian operator,\n\u0124ex ,7 was found to take on the following form [45]:\n\u0124ex = \u0124+ \u2212 \u0124\u2212 ,\nwhere:\n\u0124+ =\n\nq\n\n\uf8ee\n\nv\nu\n\n(21)\n\uf8f9\n\nu\n\u2212gtt+ J(\u03c6+ ) \uf8ef\n2lGM\u0302 \uf8fa\nt\n\uf8f01 \u2212 1 \u2212\n\uf8fb,\nlG\nJ(\u03c6+ )\n\n\u0124\u2212 =\n\nN\nN\n\u03c6o (M\u0302 ) = J \u22121 (2lGM\u0302 ).\nG\nG\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nHere, \u0124\u00b1 is the contribution to the Hamiltonian from the outer/inner boundary (i.e., box surface/horizon), gtt+ is the time-time component of the metric\nat the outer boundary, M\u0302 corresponds to the mass operator, and N is defined\naccording to:\n\"s\n#\n\u2212gtt\nd\n.\n(24)\nN=\ndx\ngxx \u03c6=\u03c6o\n6\n\nEventually, we consider the asymptotic limit of an infinitely large box or \u03c6+ \u2192 \u221e.\nFollowing [36], we label this Hamiltonian with the subscript ex for reasons that will\nsoon be made clear.\n7\n\n9\n\n\fTaking the limit of an infinitely sized box (i.e., \u03c6+ \u2192 \u221e)8 and fixing the\ntime coordinate of a boundary observer so that |gtt+ /J(\u03c6+ )| \u2192 1 at infinity,\nwe obtain the anticipated result:\n\u0124+ \u2192 M\u0302 .\n\n(25)\n\nHere, we have chosen a gauge that is quite natural, as it fixes the coordinate\ntime equal to the proper time for an asymptotic observer whose \"physical\"\nmetric is an asymptotically flat one. Meanwhile, Euclidean thermodynamic\nconsiderations can be used to fix the value of N such that N = 2\u03c0/\u03b2 [45].\nTherefore, H\u2212 = 2\u03c0\u03c6o/G\u03b2 = So /\u03b2 (cf. Eq.(13)), and so:\nSo\n(26)\n\u0124ex \u2192 M\u0302 \u2212 ,\n\u03b2\nwhich is precisely the (Helmholtz) free energy of the system.\nWe have included the label ex on the Hamiltonian to express that only\nthe exterior region of the black hole spacetime (i.e., the region outside of the\nhorizon) has been considered with the above choice of boundary conditions.\nSuch a restriction is known, at least for spherically symmetric gravity, to\ninduce a free-energy form for the Hamiltonian [22], in agreement with our\nabove (and prior [45]) findings.\nAlternatively, one could have considered a foliation that covers the entire black hole spacetime, from left-hand-side to right-hand-side asymptotic\ninfinity (including the interior regions), by considering the maximally extended \"Kruskal\" diagram.9 It is also of interest to know what the form\nof the Hamiltonian would be for this latter choice of boundary conditions.\nThis form can, in fact, be readily extrapolated from analogous calculations\nin the context of spherically symmetric gravity [20, 22, 36]. Fixing the time\ncoordinate at the right boundary as above and freezing time evolution at the\nleft boundary,10 we have in the asymptotic limit:\n\u0124wh \u2192 M\u0302 ,\n8\n\n(27)\n\nNote that J(\u03c6) is expected to increase monotonically with \u03c6 for virtually any model\nthat admits black hole solutions [50]; so that, typically, J(\u03c6+ \u2192 \u221e) \u2192 \u221e.\n9\nIn our case, this implies a suitable generalization of Kruskal coordinates [57] for 1+1dimensional gravity. Such coordinates have, indeed, been explicitly formalized in [58].\nAlso note that the \"left-hand side\" of the spacetime corresponds to the submanifold x \u2264 0\n(in which case, \u03c6 = \u2212x/l \u2265 0).\n10\nThe physical justification being that an observer should only be capable of making\nobservations at one asymptotic boundary.\n\n10\n\n\fwhere the subscript wh indicates that the whole black hole spacetime has\nnow been foliated. Evidently, with this choice of boundary conditions, the\nHamiltonian corresponds to the internal energy of the system.\nOn an intuitive level, one can understand the apparent discrepancy between Eq.(26) and Eq.(27). If the horizon is to be taken seriously, as a causal\nbarrier for a fiducial observer,11 then such an observer must necessarily be\ndeprived of information about the black hole interior. It is a general principle that any loss of information will directly translate into a gain in entropy.\n(In the current discussion, this would be an entanglement entropy from a\nquantum mechanical viewpoint.) This effect is naturally manifested in our\nformalism via the entropic contribution, \u0124\u2212 , to the exterior Hamiltonian.\nConversely, a hypothetical observer with access to the entire spacetime will\nassign no special meaning to the horizon and will, therefore, be impervious to\nits information-negating effects. That is to say, for this privileged observer,\n\u0124\u2212 must effectively vanish.\nRecalling that our current objective is to calculate the partition function (20), we must somehow deal with the bothersome issue of having (at\nleast) one Hamiltonian too many. On this point, we will argue that, with\nproper handling, the partition function describes the same thermodynamics,\nregardless of whether one chooses to work with \u0124ex or \u0124wh . (As would naturally be expected from any proponent of black hole complementarity [25].)\nTo support this claim, we will follow the logistic framework of Makela and\nRepo [36]; which is based, in large part, on Bekenstein's notion of black hole\nspectroscopy [24].\nWe begin here by considering, in view of the arguments of Bekenstein and\nothers [24, 59], a discrete spectrum for the mass operator of the black hole.\nQuantitatively speaking, one might expect the following eigenvalue equation:\nM\u0302 |Mn >= Mn |Mn >,\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, ...,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere the mass eigenvalues, Mn , increase monotonically with the quantum\nnumber n. We will also assume a level-dependent degeneracy, which will be\ndenoted by gex (Mn ) or gwh (Mn ).\nLet us concentrate, for the moment, on \u0124wh = M\u0302 . Directly incorporating\nthis Hamiltonian and the above formalism, we can re-express the partition\n11\n\nThat is, a static observer that remains outside of the horizon.\n\n11\n\n\ffunction (20) as follows:\n\u221e\nX\n\nZwh [\u03b2] =\n\nn=0\n\u221e\nX\n\n=\n\n< Mn |gwh (M\u0302 )e\u2212\u03b2 M\u0302 |Mn >\ngwh (Mn )e\u2212\u03b2Mn .\n\n(29)\n\nn=0\n\nWe require, at this point, some explicit form of the degeneracy function.\nFrom the perspective of statistical mechanics, it is most natural to assume\nthat ln gwh (Mn ) = So (Mn ), where So is the classical black hole entropy (13).\nAlso employing Eq.(11), we thus have:\n\u221e\nX\n\n2\u03c0\nexp \u2212\u03b2Mn + J \u22121 (2lGMn ) .\nZwh [\u03b2] =\nG\nn=0\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(30)\n\nLet us next consider \u0124ex as given by Eqs.(21,23,25). With this choice of\nHamiltonian, the partition function (20) now translates into:\n\u221e\nX\n\nN\ngex (Mn ) exp \u2212\u03b2 Mn \u2212 J \u22121 (2lGMn )\nZex [\u03b2] =\nG\nn=0\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n.\n\n(31)\n\nWhat about the degeneracy function in this case? Here, we will argue that\ngex (Mn ) should be unity (for all n) on the grounds of the black hole nohair theorem [60]. That is to say, an asymptotic observer who is restricted\nto the exterior should know nothing about the internal degrees of freedom\nof the black hole (which are presumably encoded within the degeneracy).\nRather, such an observer should only be able to account for the macroscopic\nparameters; which, in this toy model, are exclusively restricted to the mass.\nSetting gex (Mn ) = 1 and also fixing N = 2\u03c0/\u03b2 (as follows from Euclidean\nthermodynamic considerations [45]), we find that Zwh and Zex are indeed\nindistinguishable. Thus, we are lead to conjecture a \"universal\" partition\nfunction of the following form:\nZ[\u03b2] =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\n\u0012\n\nexp \u2212\u03b2Mn +\n\n2\u03c0 \u22121\nJ (2lGMn ) .\nG\n\u0013\n\n(32)\n\nA point of interest: if one would rather avoid the use of Euclidean thermodynamics to fix N (which may seem unsavory in view of our otherwise\n12\n\n\fLorentzian framework), then black hole complementarity [25] might have alternatively been employed for this very purpose. To put it another way, if\none subscribes a priori to observer-independent physics, then N can be constrained (by identifying the partition functions) independently of any other\nconsiderations.\n\n4\n\nQuantum-Corrected Entropy\n\nWith a single, well-defined expression for the partition function (32), we are\nnow in a position for a quantum calculation of the black hole entropy. If\nwe are going to proceed, however, an explicit form for the mass eigenvalues,\nMn , will first be required. To resolve this matter, let us first take note of\nBekenstein's proposal [24] for the eigenvalues of the horizon area:12\nAn = \u01ebnlp2 ,\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, ...,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere \u01eb is a numerical constant of order unity and lp is the Planck length.\nThis expression, of course, strictly applies to a four-dimensional theory.\nNonetheless, in view of Eqs.(14,11), the most obvious two-dimensional analogue can be written as:\nJ \u22121 (2lGM) = \u01ebn,\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, ...,\n\n(34)\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, ...,\n\n(35)\n\nor perhaps more usefully as:\nMn =\n\n1\nJ(\u01ebn),\n2lG\n\nwhere \u01eb is a constant of order G.\nFor definiteness, let us now call upon the power-law model as stipulated\nby Eqs.(15,16). In this case:\nMn =\n\n\u03b3 (\u01ebn)a+1\n.\na + 1 2lG\n\n12\n\n(36)\n\nIn later adaptations (for instance, [59]), there is often a zero-point term included as\nwell. However, for a sufficiently massive black hole, such a term is essentially irrelevant\nand can be safely neglected.\n\n13\n\n\fSubstituting the above result into Eq.(32), we have for the (universal)\npartition function:\n\u221e\nX\n\n!\n\n\u03b3 (\u01ebn)a+1 2\u03c0\n+ \u01ebn .\nexp \u2212\u03b2\nZ[\u03b2] =\na + 1 2lG\nG\nn=0\n\n(37)\n\nIt is quite evident that this summation converges, provided that a \u2265 0,\nas has been priorly assumed. However, the case of a < 0 could still be\nreadily handled via Makela and Repo's approach [36]; that is, calculating the\npartition function for the black hole radiation rather than the black hole per\nse. (This maneuver effectively reverses the sign of the exponent.) In this\nway, one can verify that our final outcome (for the entropy) can be extended\nto any choice of a.\nLet us now assume that the black hole is sufficiently massive so that the\nsummation can be replaced by an integral:\nZ[\u03b2] =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n!\n\n\u03b3 y a+1 2\u03c0\ndy exp \u2212\u03b2\n+\ny ,\na + 1 2lG\nG\n\n(38)\n\nwhere an obvious change has been made in the integration variable.\nWithout resorting to numerics, one can still proceed by employing a\nsaddle-point type of approximation. First of all, a straightforward calculation reveals an extremum in the exponent at y = yo, where yoa = 4\u03c0l/\u03b2\u03b3.\nNext, we can expand about this extremal point to obtain:\nZ[\u03b2] \u2248 e\n\n1\n2\u03c0a\n4\u03c0l a\nG(a+1) \u03b2\u03b3\n\n[\n\n]\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\"\n\na\u03c0 \u03b2\u03b3\ndy exp \uf8ed\u2212\n\u03b3 4\u03c0l\n\nThis expression is readily integrated to yield:\nZ[\u03b2] \u2248 e\n\n1\n2\u03c0a\n4\u03c0l a\nG(a+1) \u03b2\u03b3\n\n[\n\n4\u03c0l\n\u03b2\n\n!\n\na\u03c0\n\u03c9=\n\u03b3\n\n4\u03c0l\n\u03b2\u03b3\n\n!1\n\nr\n\nwhere:\n\nand erf denotes the error function.13\n13\n\nTo be precise: erf (\u03b1) = 2\n\nR\u03b1\n0\n\n1\n2a\n\n\u03b3\n4a\n\n]\n\n\u221a\nd\u03be exp(\u2212\u03be 2 )/ \u03c0.\n\n14\n\n#1\n\na\n\n(y \u2212 yo )2 \uf8f8 .\n\n\u221a i\n1 + erf ( \u03c9) ,\n\nh\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(39)\n\n(40)\n\na\n\n(41)\n\n\fAs implied above, we are specifically focusing on a semi-classical regime;\nthat is, the black hole mass should be regarded as large relative to any\nfundamental scale (which is a typical convention in studies of this nature).\nIt is clear from Eqs.(18,19) that, for the model of interest, the temperature\nincreases monotonically with mass. Hence, this semi-classical regime can be\nequally well portrayed as one of high temperature. This means that, under\ncurrent considerations, we are justified in regarding \u03b2 as small in units of the\nfundamental length scale, l. For this reason, \u03c9 can\n\u221abe viewed as a very large\n(dimensionless) quantity; thus implying that erf ( \u03c9) \u2248 1 (up to corrections\nthat vanish in the limit of infinite temperature).\nLet us consider the standard formula for extracting entropy from a thermodynamic partition function:\n!\n\n\u2202\nS = 1\u2212\u03b2\nln Z.\n\u2202\u03b2\n\n(42)\n\nSubstituting for the partition function (40) and keeping the semi-classical\napproximation in mind, we eventually have:\n2\u03c0\nS=\nG\n\n4\u03c0l\n\u03b2\u03b3\n\n!1\n\na\n\n1\nl\n+\nln\n2a\n\u03b2\n\n!\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\u03b2\n+O\uf8f0\nl\n\n!1\uf8f9\na\n\n\uf8fb + constant.\n\n(43)\n\nLet us remind ourselves that \u03b2 \u22121 is defined as the equilibrium temperature measured by an asymptotic observer. This is simply the definition of\nthe Hawking temperature,14 and so it follows that \u03b2 \u22121 = To . With this identification, we can apply Eq.(19) for To , along with Eq.(13) for the classical\nentropy (So ), and re-express Eq.(43) as follows:\nS = So +\n\ni\nh\n1\nln(So ) + O So\u22121 + constant.\n2\n\n(44)\n\nIt is a nice consistency check that we have reproduced the classical thermodynamic value with the lowest-order term. (Even if this was, more or\nless, pre-ordained by some assumptions made in Section 3.) A substantially\n14\nRecall from Section 3 that the time coordinate of the boundary observer has been fixed\nso that the \"physical\" metric is asymptotically flat. Therefore, as far as an asymptotic\nobserver is concerned, the Tolman red-shift factor is equal to unity. Hence, the asymptotic\nboundary temperature does indeed coincide with the Hawking value.\n\n15\n\n\fless trivial outcome is, however, the first-order quantum correction. Here, we\nhave confirmed the expected logarithmic dependence and, moreover, found\na prefactor of +1/2. It is interesting and perhaps disturbing that this prefactor disagrees, in both sign and magnitude, with the values obtained (for\nthe very same model) in prior calculations [27]. We will have more to say on\nthis discrepancy in the concluding section.\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, we have been investigating a generic theory of 1+1-dimensional\ndilaton-gravity; with special attention on models with a power-law form of\npotential. After some preliminaries, we employed a Lorentzian Hamiltonian\napproach as a means for studying the thermodynamics of two-dimensional\nblack holes. Black hole spectroscopy also played a substantial role in establishing a calculable expression for the quantum partition function. Ultimately, we were able to derive an expression for the entropy as an expansion\nin diminishing powers of Hawking temperature. (This temperature can be\nregarded as large in a semi-classical regime of massive black holes.) Reassuringly, the tree-level term was shown to be in precise agreement with the\nclassical thermodynamic entropy. Moreover, we have substantiated that the\nleading-order correction is directly proportional to the logarithm of the classical entropy. However, the prefactor for this logarithmic correction, +1/2,\nis in conspicuous disagreement with the values obtained (for the exact same\nmodel) by other methodologies [27].\nAn interesting feature of our formalism (specifically in Section 3) is that it\nprovides a simple but powerful framework for understanding how black hole\ncomplementarity [25] can resolve the information loss paradox [5]. As far as\na fiducial observer is concerned, the black hole horizon is a physical, causal\nboundary behind which information can indeed be lost. This apparent loss of\ninformation manifests itself as an entanglement entropy (between the interior\nand exterior regions) and is directly evident as an entropic contribution to\nthe free energy (cf. Eq.(26)). Conversely, from a global perspective, the\nhorizon is merely an artifact of poorly chosen coordinates, and there can\nbe no loss of information in this frame of reference. Rather, the black hole\nentropy arises from an inherent degeneracy in the discrete levels of the mass\nor area spectrum. (Meanwhile, the fiducial observer has no knowledge of this\n16\n\n\fdegeneracy by virtue of the no-hair theorem.) That these two viewpoints\nhave turned out to be thermodynamically equivalent can be viewed as a\nmanifestation of black hole complementarity. (For further discussion, see\n[36].)\nFinally, let us more closely examine the apparent discrepancy that has\narisen at the logarithmic order in the entropy. To review [27], a thermodynamic calculation (based on [28]) yields a prefactor of \u2212 12 (2a+1), a statistical\napproach (based on [29]-[31]) gives a value of \u22123/2, while the current, Hamiltonian program generates a value of +1/2.\nAssuming the credibility of all three methodologies, one is inclined to take\nan inventory of any possible limitations. In this regard, it is perhaps relevant\nthat the statistical approach is based on a near-horizon duality and only\naccounts for degrees of freedom within the vicinity of the horizon. However,\nthere is strong support for the notion that this is precisely where the degrees\nof freedom of a black hole spacetime should reside (for instance, [61]). On\nthe other hand, we should re-emphasize that both the thermodynamic and\nHamiltonian method invoke an assumption of large temperature. For the\ntwo-dimensional model of interest, this regime of high temperature can best\nbe viewed as a semi-classical approximation. Since we are considering a\nquantum correction to the entropy, it is quite possible that this regime is too\nrestrictive. On this basis, one might argue that, in a true quantum analysis,\nthe thermodynamic and Hamiltonian prefactors will both converge towards\nthe statistical value of \u22123/2.\nFurther support that the statistical value of the prefactor is, in some\nsense, the fundamental one follows from calculations in a quantum-geometry\ncontext. That is to say, a viable candidate for a quantum theory of gravity\nalso yields a value of \u22123/2 [32]. It may also be pertinent that the statistical\napproach is based directly on the Cardy formula [30]. More to the point, it\nhas been argued that, exclusively for a two-dimensional theory, the Cardy\nformula counts the true microstates of the black hole when it is used in\nthis manner [62]. If this is literally correct, the statistical calculation would\nindeed be entitled to an elevated status.\nOn the other hand, it could be argued that the various methods are measuring independent contributions to the first-order entropy, which should,\nat the end of the day, be summed up. For instance, it has recently been\nsuggested [43] that a positive prefactor should appear in calculations that\ndirectly measure fluctuations in the horizon area, whereas a negative pref17\n\n\factor should appear in calculations that count the number of microstates.\nOur results for the Hamiltonian and statistical methods do indeed appear to\ncomply with this notion. It does not, however, seem a priori clear as to how\nthe thermodynamic approach should be classified in this scheme; although\nthe prefactor is, in this case, typically negative.\nIt would be interesting if any of the above arguments could be supported\n(or disputed) in a more rigorous way, and we hope to address this matter in\na future study.\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author would like to thank V.P.
