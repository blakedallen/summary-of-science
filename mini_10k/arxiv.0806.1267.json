The functional ecdysone receptor is a\nheterodimer of ECR (NR1H1) and USP-RXR (NR2B4), which is the orthologue of vertebrate\nRetinoid X Receptors (RXR \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 ).

In order to\ngain further insight into the evolution of metamorphosis and gene regulation by ecdysone in\narthropods, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of both partners of the heterodimer\nECR/USP-RXR.

Our data provide the first evidence that ECR and USP-RXR\nmay have coevolved during holometabolous insect diversification, leading to a functional\ndivergence of the ecdysone receptor. These results have general implications on fundamental\naspects of insect development, evolution of nuclear receptors, and the design of specific\ninsecticides.\n\n2\n\n\fINTRODUCTION\n\nEcdysteroid hormones regulate many essential processes in reproduction and\ndevelopment of insects. In Drosophila, a single steroid metabolite, 20-hydroxyecdysone\n(called ecdysone for simplicity), is responsible for controlling the main developmental\ntransitions, including larval molts and metamorphosis (Kozlova and Thummel, 2000). It is a\nremarkable system in which one simple signal triggers specific transcriptional regulation of\nseveral genes, at different stages and in different tissues. Extensive genetic and molecular\nstudies have demonstrated that gene cascades regulated by ecdysone play a central role in the\ndevelopmental timing in Drosophila (Thummel, 2001). Evidence from a few other species\nsupports the conservation of this ecdysteroid regulatory pathway in insects (Henrich and\nBrown, 1995). But most of these species belong to the very derived holometabolous orders\nDiptera and Lepidoptera. Insects present a large range of developmental variability, affecting\nfor example ovarian organization (King and B\u00fcning, 1985), embryonic germ-band type\n(Sander, 1976; Patel et al., 1994) or the number of larval molts and the type of metamorphosis\n(Sehnal et al., 1996; Truman and Riddiford, 1999). Analysis of this diversity at the molecular\nlevel is now possible and constitutes a major objective of evolutionary developmental\nbiology.\nThe functional Drosophila ecdysone receptor is a heterodimer of the products of the\necdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (usp) genes, two nuclear receptors (Koelle et al.,\n1991; Oro et al., 1992; Yao et al., 1993). Nuclear receptors share a common organization\nconsisting of at least three structural domains: an amino-terminal domain (A/B), a central\nDNA binding domain (DBD or C domain), and a ligand binding domain (LBD or E domain)\n(Moras and Gronemeyer, 1998). In addition, a flexible linker region (D domain) is located\nbetween DBD and LBD. Some members of this family also contain a carboxy-terminal tail (F\n\n3\n\n\fdomain). The requirement of heterodimerisation between ECR and USP-RXR has been found\nin other species such as the mosquito Aedes aegypti (Wang et al., 2000), the silkmoth Bombyx\nmori (Swevers et al., 1996), and even a member of the Chelicerata, the tick Amblyomma\namericanum (Guo et al., 1998). Understanding the evolution of ecdysone regulation in insects\nrequires comparative analysis of both partners of the heterodimer.\nWithin the superfamily of nuclear receptors, ECR (NR1H1) belongs to the same group\nas the vertebrate Liver X Receptors (LXR\u03b1 and LXR\u03b2: NR1H3 and NR1H2) and Farnesoid X\nReceptor (FXR : NR1H4) which are also receptors for steroid hormones (oxysterols and bile\nacids, respectively) (Laudet and Gronemeyer, 2002). Ecdysteroids are not produced by\ndeuterostomes, such as vertebrates. Phylogenies based on 18S rDNA sequences group\narthropods and nematodes in the ecdysozoa clade of protostomes sharing the developmental\ntrait of moulting (Aguinaldo et al., 1997). However, ECR horthologues have not been\nidentified in the C. elegans genome but only in some parasitic nematodes which are sensitive\nto ecdysteroids (Sluder and Maina, 2001). Thus, molting regulation and the primary signal are\nlikely to differ among lineages within ecdysozoa. In fact, a recent analysis of more than 100\nnuclear proteins does not support the ecdysozoa hypothesis (Blair et al., 2002), and moulting\nmay have appeared several times during metazoans evolution.\nUSP-RXR (NR2B4) is the orthologue of vertebrate Retinoid X Receptors\n(RXR\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 : NR2B1, 2, 3) (Laudet and Gronemeyer, 2002). The name USP comes from the\nphenotype of Drosophila mutants (Perrimon et al., 1985), whereas RXR (Retinoid X\nReceptor) refers to the mammalian ligand (9-cis retinoic acid) (Mangelsdorf et al., 1990). In\narthropods no mutant phenotype is known outside Drosophila, and USP-RXR does not bind\n9-cis retinoid acid. Now that this gene has been isolated in a wide variety of metazoans, this\nnomenclature is sometimes confusing in the literature. In this article, we will use the name\nUSP-RXR for all arthropods and simply RXR for orthologues from other taxa. Contrary to\n\n4\n\n\fECR, the three-dimensional structure of RXR proteins has been well studied. The crystal\nstructures of the human RXR\u03b1 LBD (Bourguet et al., 1995; Egea et al., 2000) and DBD (Lee\net al., 1993) have been determined, as well as the USP-RXR LBDs of Drosophila\nmelanogaster (Clayton et al., 2001) and of the Lepidoptera Heliothis virescens (Billas et al.,\n2001). Comparison of these structures reveals that Drosophila and Heliothis USP-RXR LBDs\nare locked in an inactive conformation. Furthermore, authors of these studies suggest that\nthere may be a natural ligand for this USP-RXR, previously seen as an orphan receptor. In\nvitro studies have shown that juvenile hormone III can bind Drosophila USP-RXR with a\nvery low affinity (Jones et al., 1997; 2001). This hormone is a sesquiterpenoid chemically\nanalog to retinoids and involved in the control of insect molting and metamorphosis.\nHowever, the possibility that juvenile hormone is a natural ligand of USP-RXR awaits further\nevidence. It has been proposed that arthropods lost the ability to bind 9-cis retinoid acid\n(Escriva et al., 2000). Then this loss may have been followed by acquisition of a new ligand\nthat remains to be identified.\nCloning of ECR or USP-RXR from various arthropods led several authors to observe\nan intriguing divergence of both proteins in Diptera and Lepidoptera (reviewed in Riddiford\net al., 2001). In order to gain further insight into the evolution of ecdysone regulation in\narthropods, we performed an evolutionary analysis of both partners. Sequence alignments and\nstructural comparisons reveal a combination of variation and conservation in important\nfunctional domains for both ECR and USP-RXR. The major structural divergences are\nspecific to Diptera and Lepidoptera. The most impressive differences affect the LBD domain\nof USP-RXR. ECR sequences also show variability in other domains, namely the DBD and\nthe carboxy-terminal F domain. Furthermore, we show that the LBDs of both proteins are\ncharacterized by an acceleration of divergence rates in the Diptera-Lepidoptera lineage. Our\ndata provide the first evidence that ECR and USP-RXR may have coevolved during the\n\n5\n\n\fcourse of holometabolous insect diversification, probably leading to a functional divergence\nof the ecdysone receptor. They also show that Diptera and Lepidoptera, the most widely used\nmodel organisms to analyze ecdysone regulation, are in fact very derived species concerning\nthis developmental system. Therefore, extreme care must be taken when results from\nDrosophila or Manduca are generalized, in particular concerning both fundamental aspects of\ninsect development and the design of specific insecticides.\n\n6\n\n\fMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nCloning and sequencing of cDNAs\n\nNew USP-RXR and/or ECR sequences were obtained by RT-PCR from the following\nspecies: Leptopilina heterotoma (USP-RXR: 850 bp; ECR: 702 bp); Alfalfa weevi (USP-RXR:\n854 bp); Periplaneta americana (USP-RXR: 902 bp); Folsomia candida (USP-RXR: 665 bp);\nLithobius forficatus (USP-RXR: 916 bp) (Table 1).\n5 \u03bcg of total RNA were reverse transcribed with random primers and MMLV reverse\ntranscriptase in 20 \u03bcl of reaction mixture according to the manufacturer's instruction (GIBCOBRL, MMLV-RT kit). The resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR in 100 \u03bcl volume with 10\nmM Tris-Hcl pH = 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2 (Perkin-Elmer), 0.25mM of each dXTP,\n2.5 U Taq Gold DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and 300 ng of each primer.\nDegenerate primers were designed from an alignment of nucleic sequences for either\nusp-RXR or EcR. The primers are located within conserved sequences coding the DNA\nbinding and ligand binding domains. Four primers were designed for each gene; their\norientation and exact position in Drosophila cDNA sequences (usp: X53417; EcR: M74078)\nare indicated below into brackets:\nusp51: 5' GGI AA(a/g) CA(c/t) TA(c/t) GGI GTI TAC AG\n\n(Forward, 499-421)\n\nusp52: 5' TG(c/t) GA(a/g) GGI TG(c/t) AA(a/g) GGI TT(c/t) TT(c/t) AA\n\n(Forward, 423-548)\n\nusp32: 5' T(g/t)(c/g) I(g/t)I CGI (c/g)(a/t)(a/g) T(a/g)C TC(c/t) TC\n\n(Reverse, 1483-1502)\n\nusp31: 5' GTG TCI CCI ATI AG(c/t) TT(a/g) AA\n\n(Reverse, 1597-1616)\n\necr51: 5' ATG TG(c/t) (c/t)TI GTI TG(c/t) GGI GA\n\n(Forward, 1855-1874)\n\necr53: 5' TG(c/t) GAI ATI GA(c/t) AT(c/g) TA(c/t) ATG\n\n(Forward, 1984-2004)\n\necr33: 5' C(g/t)I GCC A(c/t)I C(g/t)(c/g) A(a/g)C ATC AT\n\n(Reverse, 2578-2597)\n\n7\n\n\fecr31: 5' (c/g)IA (c/t)(a/g)T CCC A(a/g)A (c/t)(c/t)T CIT CIA (a/g)GA A\n\n(Reverse, 3001-3025)\n\nFor each gene, all combinations of the four primers were used in semi-nested PCR\namplifications. Reactions were performed in a Perkin-Elmer Thermal Cycler 480, using a\nmodified \"Touch Down\" protocol. Briefly, after an initial 10min cycle at 94\u00b0C; cycles 1-5:\n94\u00b0C 1 min, 55\u00b0C 1 min, 74\u00b0C 2 min; cycles 6-10: 94\u00b0C 1 min, 50\u00b0C 1 min, 74\u00b0C 2 min;\ncycles 11-15: 94\u00b0C 1 min, 45\u00b0C 1 min, 74\u00b0C 2 min; cycles 16-20: 94\u00b0C 1 min, 40\u00b0C 1 min,\n74\u00b0C 2 min; cycle 21-40: 94\u00b0C 1 min, 37\u00b0C 1 min, 74\u00b0C 2 min; followed by terminal\nelongation for 10 min at 74\u00b0C. Extreme care was taken against contamination: PCR were\nperformed in rooms devoted to ancient DNA studies with overpressure, UV lights and\ndedicated hoods.\nPCR products were cloned into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into\ncompetent cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing reactions were\nperformed using a Dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit with AmpliTaq DNA\npolymerase FS (Applied Biosystems).\nProtein Sequence analysis\n\nAll available sequences were obtained from NUREBASE (Duarte et al., 2002).\nSpecies and accession numbers are shown in Table 1. Protein-coding sequences were aligned\nusing SEAVIEW (Galtier et al., 1996). All positions with gaps were excluded from analyses.\nPhylogenetic reconstruction was made with Neighbour Joining (Saitou and Nei, 1987) with\nobserved differences as implemented in Phylo_Win (Galtier et al., 1996). The number of\ncomplete aligned sites used for tree reconstruction is 74 for ECR DBD, 221 for ECR LBD, 77\nfor USP-RXR DBD and 145 for USP-RXR LBD. Bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates was\nused to assess support for nodes in the tree (Felsenstein, 1985). The phylogenetic tree of\n\n8\n\n\fRXR/USP sequences is rooted by the jellyfish Tripedelia cystophora RXR sequence\n(Kostrouch et al., 1998). The tree of ECR is rooted by vertebrate LXR and FXR sequences.\nEvolutionary distances between sequences were mapped on a pre-defined species\nconsensus tree using Tree-Puzzle (Schmidt et al., 2002), with the JTT substitution model\n(Jones et al., 1992) plus rate heterogeneity between sites, estimated by a gamma law with\neight categories. The consensus tree is based on classical taxonomic data, as well as more\nspecific references concerning the following groups: Diptera (Yeates and Wiegmann, 1999),\nLepidoptera (Weller et al., 1992; Regier et al., 2001), Insects (Kristensen 1981; Whiting et al.,\n1997) and Arthropods (Hwang et al., 2001; Giribet et al., 2001).\nIn addition, rates were compared between lineages using the relative-rate test on all\navailable sequences (Wilson et al., 1977 ; Robinson, et al., 1998), weighting by the predefined tree topology, as implemented in RRTree (Robinson-Rechavi and Huchon, 2000),\nwith a Poisson correction for multiple substitutions.\n\n9\n\n\fRESULTS\n\nECR and USP-RXR sequences\n\nIn order to study the role of the ecdysone receptor during evolution of arthropod\nmetamorphosis, we analyzed the evolution of its two components: ECR and USP-RXR. When\nthis work was initiated, most of the sequences available in the public databases had been\nisolated from Diptera and Lepidoptera species. Therefore, it was necessary to investigate a\nlarger sample of insects and other arthropods. Using an RT-PCR approach with degenerated\nprimers located within the DBD and the LBD, we cloned and sequenced cDNA fragments\ncoding for USP-RXR or ECR from five new species (Table 1). These new species give a\ncomplete sampling of the different types of metamorphosis in arthropods: holometaboly or\ncomplete metamorphosis outside Diptera and Lepidoptera (Hymenoptera and Coleoptera),\nheterometaboly or incomplete metamorphosis (Dictyoptera), ametaboly or absence of\nmetamorphosis (Collembola), plus one myriapod. Overall, 38 USP-RXR and 19 ECR protein\nsequences have been used for this analysis, from 33 species. Regarding evolution of these two\nproteins, as it will be shown further in this article, these 33 species can be distributed into six\ngroups: Diptera (8 species), Lepidoptera (6), other hexapods (7), other arthropods (3),\nchordates (8) and cnidaria (1) (Table 1). Importantly, the phylogenetic relationships among\nthese six groups are well known and are non ambiguous (see Fig. 1).\n\nMolecular phylogeny of ECR and USP-RXR\n\nCloning of ECR or USP-RXR homologues from various arthropods has previously\nrevealed that these proteins are divergent in Diptera and Lepidoptera. This is particularly clear\n\n10\n\n\ffor the LBD of USP-RXR, when sequences from a tick (Guo et al., 1998), a crab (Chung et\nal., 1998), a locust (Hayward et al., 1999) or a beetle (Nicola\u00ef et al., 2000) are compared to\nDiptera and Lepidoptera sequences. Although less obvious, the same phenomenon affects\nECR (Guo et al., 1997; Saleh et al., 1998; Verras et al., 1999). Understanding this\nevolutionary divergence should give important insights on the evolution of insect\nmetamorphosis and the functional plasticity of nuclear receptors. Therefore, we performed an\nanalysis of all ECR and USP-RXR sequences together, in order to measure their evolutionary\nrates and to identify precisely the divergent regions. After sequence alignment, identity\npercentages and phylogenetic trees were determined separately for the DBD and LBD of both\nproteins.\nPairwise comparisons show a clear divergence in the LBD of USP-RXR between\nDiptera-Lepidoptera and other species (Table 2). There is only 49% identity between DipteraLepidoptera and other insects, as opposed to 68% between these other insects and other\narthropods, and 70% between the other insects and chordates. Thus, the USP-RXR LBD of\nmany insects is less similar to Diptera and Lepidoptera than it is to the chordate RXRs. The\nsame is true of the DBD and LBD domains of ECR (Table 2), although the divergence is less\npronounced.\nA Neighbour Joining analysis with observed differences performed using the fulllength LBD of ECR or USP-RXR obtained the trees shown in Figure 2. Similar topologies are\nfound by parsimony analysis (data not shown; see also: Guo et al., 1997; Guo et al., 1998;\nHayward et al., 1999). It should be emphasized that our aim is not to reconstruct the\nphylogeny of species using RXR or ECR as markers, but rather to characterize the evolution\nof these receptors using phylogeny as a tool. The trees are therefore presented here to\nillustrate the aberrant topology with regard to insect phylogeny, and to show the length of the\nbranches. In both trees, it can be seen that Diptera and Lepidoptera sequences constitute a\n\n11\n\n\fmonophyletic group separated from all the other insects. The bootstrap score for the branch\nthat separates Diptera-Lepidoptera from other insects is 100% (boxed). All the other insects\nare grouped in a branch with a high bootstrap value:100% for ECR (Fig. 2A) and 87% for\nUSP-RXR (Fig. 2B). These topologies are clearly in contradiction with the phylogeny of the\nspecies (Fig. 1). For example, the coleoptera Tenebrio molitor belongs to the holometabolous\ninsects, a monophyletic group which includes Diptera and Lepidoptera. However the USPRXR LBD from this beetle is more similar to that of a chelicerate (Amblyomma americanum),\nor even of a chordate, than of a Diptera such as Drosophila. The trees of Figure 2 also show\nthat Diptera and Lepidoptera sequences share long branches, when compared to other\narthropods proteins. This observation is indicative of a rapid rate of divergence.\n\nAnalysis of evolutionary rates\n\nThe phylogenetic analysis suggests that USP-RXR and ECR sequences have\nundergone accelerated evolution in the Diptera-Lepidoptera lineage. We therefore decided to\nestimate and to compare the rates of divergence between groups of species.\nIn order to obtain the best estimates of branch lengths, we used a constraint topology\nbased on the known phylogenetic relationships between all the species analyzed in this article\n(Fig. 1). Evolutionary distances between sequences were mapped on this pre-defined species\nconsensus phylogeny. The trees obtained by this method are shown in Figure 3. Moreover,\nrates were compared between lineages using the relative-rate test on all available sequences.\nResults are shown in Table 3, as differences of substitution rate between groups of species.\nFrom these analyses, it appears that both ECR and USP-RXR LBD sequences of Diptera and\nLepidoptera have evolved at significantly different rates than other species (Fig. 3B, C and\nTable 3). The strongest rate difference is with USP-RXR LBDs. Despite the important\n\n12\n\n\fdistances obtained by mapping ECR DBD sequences on the pre-defined tree for DipteraLepidoptera (Fig. 3A), rate differences are not significant for DBDs (data not shown). This\nmay be due to the small numbers of sites available for the test (80 amino-acids).\nOur data clearly show that both ECR and USP-RXR experienced a very strong\nacceleration of evolutionary rate in Diptera and Lepidoptera versus other insects. It is\ntherefore essential to identify which regions of the proteins were affected by this acceleration.\n\nDivergence of the Ligand Binding Domain of USP-RXR\n\nIt has been shown recently that both crystal structures of a Lepidopteran (Heliothis)\nand a Dipteran (Drosophila) USP-RXR LBD are locked in an unusual antagonist\nconformation (Billas et al., 2001 ; Clayton et al., 2001). Sequence alignment clearly shows\nthe differences between the LBD of USP-RXR proteins from Diptera and Lepidoptera and\ntheir homologues in other arthropods. They are grouped into three divergent domains and are\nnot located randomly along the sequence (Fig. 4).\nInterestingly, many differences affect precisely two regions that are implicated in the\nunusual conformation of Drosophila and Heliothis USP-RXRs: the loop between helices H1\nand H3, and the carboxy-terminal end of the LBD (helix H12 and the loop between H11 and\nH12) (Fig. 3). Helix H12 is locked in an inactive position by making contacts with the loop\nH1-H3, specifically with a conserved domain of 13 residues (boxed in gray in Fig. 4). This\ndomain is well conserved within the lineage of Diptera and Lepidoptera, but is absent in other\narthropods, where the loop H1-H3 is highly variable in length and in sequence. Furthermore,\nthree (Heliothis) or four (Drosophila) residues of the conserved region interact with the\nphospholipid ligand cocrystallized with the LBD (Fig. 4). While helix H12 is highly\nconserved among most arthropods and chordates, sequences of H12 and of the loop H11-H12\n\n13\n\n\fare variable in Diptera and Lepidoptera. Most of the differences are conservative. The loop\nL5-s1, connecting helix H5 and the \u03b2-strand s1 is longer in Diptera and Lepidoptera USPRXR, with little conservation in the additional residues (Fig. 4). Unfortunately, this region\ncould not be modeled because its conformation is not ordered in the crystal (Billas et al.,\n2001 ; Clayton et al., 2001). Thus, further experiments are needed to decipher the putative\nrole of this intriguing insertion.\n\nDivergent domains in ECR\n\nDespite an increase in evolutionary rates (Table 3) the ECR LBDs are rather well\nconserved in length and sequence (Table 2 and data not shown). This conservation enabled\nWurtz et al. (2000) to identify the canonical 11 helices and to model 20-hydroxyecdysone\nbinding for the Diptera Chironomus tentans. Thus, contrary to USP-RXR, there is no obvious\ndivergence of the structure of ECR LBD in Diptera and Lepidoptera. This could be due to the\nconstraint on all ECRs to presumably bind 20-hydroxyecdysone (Riddiford et al., 2001).\nThe DBD of ECR contains six amino-acid differences specific for the DipteraLepidoptera group (Fig. 5A). By contrast, USP-RXR DBD sequences do not show any\nspecific differences (Fig. 5B). Among the six differences observed for ECR, only one is not\nconservative and is located just upstream of the second zinc-finger. It is a hydrophobic\nresidue in Diptera (cysteine) and Lepidoptera (isoleucine), but a polar amino-acid (glutamine)\nin other arthropods. Interestingly, four of these substitutions are located in or near the second\nzinc finger, a region known to form a dimerization interface for some nuclear receptors (Luisi\net al., 1991; Schwabe et al., 1993).\nA surprising originality of Diptera-Lepidoptera ECRs is the presence of a carboxyterminal F domain (Fig. 6). This domain of variable length (226 in Drosophila and 18 in\n\n14\n\n\fChoristoneura) does not show any sequence conservation between species. Other insect and\narthropod ECRs possess only two to four amino-acids in carboxy-terminal of the putative\nhelix H12 which ends the LBD. Most nuclear receptors do not contain any sizable region\ncarboxy terminal of the LBD, including mammalian LXR and FXR, other proteins from the\nECR group. Therefore, it appears that the presence of an F domain in ECR is an evolutionary\nacquisition of Diptera and Lepidoptera.\n\n15\n\n\fDISCUSSION\nThis article is the first comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the ecdysone receptor, a\nmajor regulatory factor of insect development. Both partners of the ECR/USP-RXR\nheterodimer, which constitutes the functional ecdysone receptor, experienced a strong\nacceleration of evolutionary rate in Diptera and Lepidoptera. This acceleration defines a clear\nseparation within holometabolous insects. Diptera and Lepidoptera belong to the clade\nPanorpida (Kristensen, 1981), with Hymenoptera as a sister group. Panorpida also includes:\nTrichoptera (caddisflies), the sister group of Lepidoptera, and Mecoptera (scorpionflies) and\nSiphonaptera (fleas) which are more closely related to Diptera (Fig. 1). The phylogenetic\nposition of Strepsiptera is unclear (Whiting et al., 1997; Rokas et al., 1999). Thus the\nhypothesis of a unique event of acceleration in the ancestor of Diptera and Lepidoptera could\nbe tested by isolation of ECR and USP-RXR sequences from other Panorpida. This event of\nacceleration could be responsible for the accelerated evolutionary rates at the base of and\nwithin these groups. We already know that USP-RXR and ECR sequences from a flea (M.\nPalmer, personal communication) are more similar to Diptera and Lepidoptera than to other\ninsects (data not shown), which supports our hypothesis. Regarding evolution of\nmetamorphosis, the divergence of the ecdysone receptor does not correlate with the different\ntypes of insect's metamorphosis. It may be necessary to isolate more full-length sequences\nfrom several species outside Panorpida to decipher a specific trend at this level.\n\nWe have identified several protein domains for which sequence divergence is specific\nto Diptera and Lepidoptera. All members of the nuclear hormone receptor family share the\ncanonical LBD structure with 11 helices (H1, H3-H12) connected by loops and two short \u03b2strands (s1 and s2). The typical activation of nuclear receptor implies the binding of the\nagonist ligand in the pocket. This binding triggers a repositioning of helix H12 that provides\n16\n\n\fthe surface for co-activator interaction and thereby allows the transactivation activity of the\nnuclear receptor. In the case of an antagonist, helix H12 moves precisely into the hydrophobic\nfurrow where the co-activator interacts in the agonist conformation (Moras and Gronemeyer,\n1998). In the Drosophila and Heliothis USP-RXR structures, the loop between helices H1 and\nH3 is located inside the hydrophobic furrow of the LBD, thereby preventing the repositioning\nof helix H12 and interactions with coactivators, and locking these USP-RXRs in an unusual\nantagonist conformation (Billas et al., 2001 ; Clayton et al., 2001). In the light of these\nresults, our observation of Diptera and Lepidoptera specific sequence diversity in both the\nloop H1-H3 and the helix H12 suggests a form of concerted evolution between these two\ninteracting regions of the USP-RXR LBD. This evolution may have changed the liganddependent transactivation activity of the protein. It may also have had an effect on the ligand\nbinding activity, since the loop H1-H3 contains residues that interact with the phospholipid\ncocrystallized with Drosophila and Heliothis LBD. On the other hand, given the very strong\nconservation of Helix H10, it is likely that the dimerisation activity of USP-RXR LBD\nremained unchanged during evolution.\n\nIt is intriguing that the LBD of ECR underwent a significant increase of substitution\nrate in Diptera and Lepidoptera, while its structure remained apparently largely unchanged. In\nall insects, and presumably in all arthropods, ECR LBD binds 20-hydroxyecdysone (Riddiford\net al., 2001). This fundamental interaction may represent the primary selective constraint\nacting on this domain. However, nuclear receptor LBDs are also involved in\nheterodimerisation activity. This rapid evolution of ECR can be explained by adaptation to the\nextremely divergent USP-RXR, and eventually acquisition of new partners. It may be that the\nstability of the heterodimer required compensatory changes in ECR and USP-RXR, suggestive\nof coevolution. The differences seen in ECR DBD also suggest functional changes in\n\n17\n\n\fdimerisation. Indeed, four of the six substitutions which are conserved among Diptera and\nLepidoptera are located at positions known to be involved in protein dimerisation but not in\nDNA contact or nuclear localization signal (Khorasanizadeh and Rastinejad, 2001; Black et\nal., 2001). Another difference specific to Diptera and Lepidoptera is the presence of a\ncarboxy-terminal F domain. This difference is interesting, since it is known that when present\n(ER\u03b1, HNF-4) the F domain of nuclear receptors can regulate different functions of the LBD.\nFor example, the F domain of human estrogen receptor ER\u03b1 can modulate transcriptional\nactivity and dimerisation signal, probably through interaction with the AF-2 domain (Montano\net al., 1995 ; Nichols et al., 1998 ; Peters and Khan, 1999).\n\nAn important conclusion of this sequence analysis is that the major structural\ndifferences of USP-RXR and ECR are specific to Diptera and Lepidoptera. We hypothesize\nthat these differences changed two functional properties of the heterodimeric ecdysone\nreceptor during insect evolution, namely the ligand-dependent transactivation and the heterodimerisation activities of both USP-RXR and ECR. These hypotheses could now be tested by\na comparative genetic approach using Drosophila melanogaster and another holometabolous\ninsect chosen outside the Panorpida group. This should help to usefully extend our knowledge\nconcerning the biological role of ecdysone. Indeed, our work indicates that the current model\norganisms used to analyze the ecdysone pathway are in fact very derived species. Therefore,\nextreme care must be taken when results obtained from Panorpida are generalized, notably\nconcerning both fundamental aspects of insect development and the design of specific\ninsecticides.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n18\n\n\fWe thank Laure Debure for samples of Periplaneta americana, Guillaume Balavoine for\nFolsomia candida, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fleury for Leptopilina heterotoma, Elisabeth Rull for help in RTPCR experiments, Melanie Palmer and two reviewers for their very helpful comments.

This\nconsensus tree is based on classical taxonomic data, as well as more specific references\nconcerning the following groups: Diptera (Yeates and Wiegmann, 1999), Lepidoptera (Weller\net al., 1992; Regier et al., 2001), Insects (Kristensen 1981; Whiting et al., 1997) and\nArthropods (Hwang et al., 2001; Giribet et al., 2001). Species names underlined indicate that\nboth ECR and USP-RXR sequences are available for these species. Regarding evolution of\nthese proteins, two artificial groups are indicated: \"other insects\" for all insects excluding\nPanorpida, and \"other arthropods\" for all arthropods excluding insects.\n\nFigure 2: Phylogenetic trees of LBD domains. (A) ECR, (B) USP-RXR. Trees were\nconstructed with the Neighbour-Joining method performed with the full-length LBD of ECR\n(17 sequences) or USP-RXR (36 sequences). Positions with a gap were excluded from the\ncomputation, resulting in 221 complete sites for ECR and 145 complete sites for USP-RXR.\nThe RXR protein from the jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora was used as an outgroup to USPRXRs, and all mammalian LXR and FXR sequences to ECRs. For legibility, outgroups are\nnot shown. Figures at nodes are bootstrap proportions out of 1000 replicates; only values \u2265\n50% are shown. The boxed bootstrap values highlight two important nodes leading to\nPanorpida and \"other insects\". Branch lengths are proportional to sequence divergence; the\nmeasure bar represents 0.1 differences per site. Diptera and Lepidoptera species are in bold.\n\nFigure 3: Pre-defined trees with evolutionary distances for ECR and USP-RXR. ECR\nDBD (A), ECR LBD (B), USP-RXR DBD (C), USP-RXR LBD (D). Evolutionary distances\nbetween sequences were mapped on a pre-defined species consensus tree (see figure 1) using\n\n27\n\n\fTree-Puzzle (Schmidt et al., 2002), with the JTT substitution model (Jones et al., 1992) plus\nrate heterogeneity between sites, estimated by a gamma law with eight categories. Branch\nlengths are proportional to evolutionary change; the measure bar represents 0.1 substitutions\nper site. Diptera and Lepidoptera species are in bold.\n\nFigure 4: Sequence alignment of USP-RXR LBD domains. Sequences are aligned with\nhuman RXR\u03b1; names of Diptera species are in bold and underlined, names of Lepidoptera\nspecies are in bold. The 11 helices and the two \u03b2-strands (s1, s2) are boxed. Residues\ninteracting with the ligand in the Ligand Binding Pocket (LBP) are indicated by asterisks (*)\nbelow the alignments. Structural data are from the following sources: Human RXR\u03b1\n(Bourguet et al., 1995 ; Egea et al., 2000), Heliothis USP-RXR (Billas et al., 2001) and\nDrosophila USP-RXR (Clayton et al., 2001). Note that helices H3 and H12 are shorter in\nHuman RXR\u03b1, as indicated by a dashed vertical line in the amino-terminal of these helices.\nThe gray box in the loop H1-H3 highlights a region conserved between Diptera\n\nand\n\nLepidoptera. RT-PCR clones of five species (Lithobius, Folsomia, Periplaneta, Alfalfa,\nLeptopilina) lack some of the carboxy-terminal regions: an X indicates the end of these partial\nsequences. The few residues (3 to 12) following the helix H12, and therefore outside of the\nstructurally defined LBD, are also shown on this figure.\n\nFigure 5: Sequences alignment of DBD domains. (A) ECR and (B) USP-RXR. ECR\nsequences are aligned with Celuca ECR, USP-RXRs are aligned with human RXR\u03b1.\nStructural data are from Lee et al. (1993) and Khorasanizadeh and Rastinejad (2001). The two\nzinc-fingers are underlined on each sequence of reference and they are also indicated below\nthe alignments; critical cysteine residues of the zinc-fingers are identified with asterisks.\nNames of Diptera species are in bold and underlined; names of Lepidoptera species are in\n\n28\n\n\fbold. The gray boxes indicate ECR divergent positions between Diptera-Lepidoptera and\nother arthropods.\n\nFigure 6: Sequence alignment of ECR F domains. Sequences are aligned with Drosophila\nECR. Names of Diptera species are in bold and underlined; names of Lepidoptera species are\nin bold. Putative helix H12 (Wurtz et al., 2000) is boxed. Amino-acids following the helix\nH12 are numbered above Drosophila sequence. The total number of residues in carboxyterminal domains of ECR proteins is indicated at the end of each sequence.\n\n29\n\n\fTable1: Accession number and phylogenetic origin of proteins used in this study.\na\n\nPartial sequences. b This paper.\n\nGroup\n\nSpecies\n\nUSP-RXR\n\nECR (and related)\n\nDiptera\n\nDrosophila melanogaster\n\nP20153\n\nP34021\n\nLepidoptera\n\nCeratitis capitata\n\nCAA11907\n\nLucilia cuprina\n\nO18531\n\nCalliphora vicina\n\nAAG46050\n\nSarcophaga crassipalpis\n\nAAF44674 a\n\nAAF44673 a\n\nAedes aegypti\n\nAAG24886\n\nP49880\n\nAedes albopictus\n\nAAF19033\n\nAAF19032\n\nChironomus tentans\n\nAAC03056\n\nP49882\n\nBombyx mori\n\nS44490\n\nP49881\n\nManduca sexta\n\nP54779\n\nP49883\n\nHeliothis virescens\n\n14278415 a\n\nO18473\n\nJunonia coenia\n\nCAB63485 a\n\nBicyclus anynana\n\nCAB63236 a\n\nChoristoneura fumiferana\nHymenoptera Apis mellifera\n\nAAC31795\n\nAAC61596\n\nAAF73057\n\nLeptopilina heterotoma\n\nAY157931 ab\n\nAY157932 ab\n\nTenebrio molitor\n\nCAB75361\n\nCAA72296\n\nAlfalfa weezi\n\nAY157933 ab\n\nOrthoptera\n\nLocusta migratoria\n\nAAF00981\n\nDictyoptera\n\nPeriplaneta americana\n\nAY157928 ab\n\nCollembola\n\nFolsomia candida\n\nAY157930 ab\n\nCrustacea\n\nCeluca pugilator\n\nAAC32789\n\nColeoptera\n\nAAD19828\n\nAAC33432\n\n30\n\n\fChelicerata\n\nAmblyomma americanum\n\nRXR1: AAC15588\n\nAAB94566\n\nRXR2: AAC15589\nMyriapoda\n\nLithobius forficatus\n\nAY157929 ab\n\nVertebrata\n\nHomo sapiens\n\nRXR\u03b1: CAA36982\n\nLXR\u03b1: Q13133\n\nRXRss: AAA60293\n\nLXRss: P55055\n\nRXR\u03b3: AAA80681\n\nFXR: AAB08107\n\nRXR\u03b1: AAA42093\n\nLXR\u03b1: Q62685\n\nRattus norvegicus\n\nLXRss: Q62755\nFXR: A56918\nRattus rattus\n\nRXRss: AAA42025\n\nMus musculus\n\nRXR\u03b1: AAA40080\n\nLXR\u03b1: Q9Z0Y9\n\nRXRss: CAA46963\n\nLXRss: Q60644\n\nRXR\u03b3: CAA46964\n\nFXR: NP_033134\n\nGallus gallus\n\nRXR\u03b3: CAA41743\n\nXenopus laevis\n\nRXR\u03b1: P51128\nRXRss: S73269\nRXR\u03b3: P51129\n\nDanio rerio\n\nRXR\u03b1: AAC59719\nRXRss1: AAC59722\nRXRss2: AAC59721\nRXR\u03b3: AAC59720\n\nUrochordata\n\nPolyandrocarpa misakiensis BAA82618 a\n\nCnidaria\n\nTripedalia cystophora\n\nAAC80008\n\n31\n\n\fTable 2.
