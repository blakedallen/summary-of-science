VINBERG\n\n1. Introduction\n1.1. In [7], V. Kac and M. Wakimoto suggested a construction of some class of rational vertex\nalgebras coming from W-algebras. The data for this construction consists of a positive integer m\nand a nilpotent element e of a semisimple Lie algebra g satisfying some special conditions (see\nSection 2). A pair (m, e) satisfying those conditions was called exceptional by Kac and Wakimoto.\nThey classified exceptional pairs in simple Lie algebras of type An . In this paper, we simplify the\ndefinition of exceptional pairs and classify such pairs in all semisimple Lie algebras. In particular,\nwe prove that, for any semisimple Lie algebra g and for any m, there is at most one, up to\nconjugation, nilpotent element e in g such that the pair (m, e) is exceptional.\n1.2. Let G be a connected semisimple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field F of\ncharacteristic 0, and let g =Lie G.\nLet spr be a principal sl2 -subalgebra of g [8]. The corresponding connected subgroup S pr \u2208 G\nis isomorphic to SL2 or P SL2 , in the former case its center being contained in the center of G.\nLet hpr be the semisimple element of spr corresponding to the matrix diag(1, \u22121) \u2208 sl2 .\nFor a positive integer m, let \u03b52m \u2208 F be a primitive 2m-th root of 1, and let sm be the element\nof S pr corresponding to the matrix diag(\u03b52m , \u03b5\u22121\n2m ). Then \u03c3m = Ad(sm ) is an automorphism of\norder m of g. We shall call \u03c3m a principal automorphism of order m. Note that in general there\nare several conjugacy classes of principal automorphisms of order m depending on the choice of\n\u03b52m .\nThe action of \u03c3m can be described as follows. Choose a maximal torus T \u2282 G and a Weyl\nchamber in t =Lie T containing hpr . Let {\u03b11 , ..., \u03b1n } be the corresponding set of simple roots.\nThen \u03b1i (hpr ) = 2 for i = 1, . . . , n. For any root \u03b1, denote by ht(\u03b1) its height, i. e. the sum of\ncoefficients in the linear expression of \u03b1 in terms of \u03b11 , ..., \u03b1n . Then, for any root vector e\u03b1 ,\nht(\u03b1)\n\u03c3m (e\u03b1 ) = \u03b5m\ne\u03b1 ,\n\nwhere \u03b5m = \u03b522m .\nFor any automorphism \u03c3 of g, denote by g\u03c3 the subalgebra of fixed points of \u03c3. Clearly, the\nsubalgebra g\u03c3m up to conjugacy does not depend on the choice of \u03b52m . Set\nd(m) = dim g\u03c3m .\nRecall that, for a simple Lie algebra g, its Coxeter number h(g) is defined as the order of the\nCoxeter element of the Weyl group, and it is known [8] that\nh(g) = ht(\u03b4) + 1,\nwhere \u03b4 is the highest root of g. The Coxeter numbers of simple Lie algebras are given in the\nfollowing table:\nAn\nBn\ng\nh(g) n + 1 2n\n\nCn\n2n\n\nDn\n2n \u2212 2\n\nE6\n12\n\nE7\n18\n\nE8\n30\n\nF4\n12\n\nG2\n6\n\nFor any reductive Lie algebra l, define the Coxeter number h(l) as the maximum of the Coxeter\nnumbers of the simple factors of l. (For l abelian, set h(l) = 1.)\nThe above formula for the action of \u03c3m implies that d(m) =rk(g) (that is, sm is a regular element\nof G) if and only if m > h(g). It is interesting that in the cases m = h(g) and m = h(g) + 1 the\nautomorphism \u03c3m is, up to conjugacy, the only regular inner automorphism of order m [6].\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA. G. ELASHVILI, V. G. KAC, E. B. VINBERG\n\nTheorem 1. (J.-P. Serre [10].) Let \u03c3 be an inner automorphism of g satisfying the condition\n\u03c3 m = id for a positive integer m. Then\ndim g\u03c3 > d(m).\nA proof of this theorem has never been published. By a kind permission of Serre, we include\nhis elegant proof in Section 3 of this paper.\nCorollary[6]. Regular semisimple elements s \u2208 G with Ad(s)m = id exist if and only if m > h(g)\n(and in this case sm is one of such elements).\n1.3. For a nilpotent element e \u2208 g, denote by L(e) the centralizer of a maximal torus of the\ncentralizer Z(e) of e in G. This is a (reductive) Levi subgroup of G defined up to conjugacy by\nan element of Z(e). Its tangent Lie algebra l(e) contains e. Define the Coxeter number h(e) of e\nas the Coxeter number of l(e).\nTheorem 2. For any nilpotent element e \u2208 g with h(e) 6 m,\ndim Z(e) > d(m).\nThis theorem looks similar to the above theorem of Serre. For even nilpotent elements, it can\nbe proved if making use of an unpublished result of D. Panyushev. But, unfortunately, we do not\nhave a conceptual proof of Theorem 2 in general case. In this paper, a proof of it comes as a result\nof classification: see Sections 4,5.\nDefinition. Let m be a positive integer and e \u2208 g be a nilpotent element. The pair (m, e) is\ncalled exceptional if\n(I)\n(II)\n\nh(e) 6 m,\ndim Z(e) = d(m).\n\nIn this case e is called an exceptional nilpotent element and m an exceptional integer (for g).\nThis definition does not coincide with but is essentially equivalent to that of Kac and Wakimoto:\nsee the discussion in Section 2.\nLet g = g1 + ... + gs be the decomposition of g into a direct sum of simple ideals, and let\ne = e1 + ... + es (ei \u2208 gi ) be a nilpotent element. Clearly, the pair (m, e) is exceptional in g if\nand only if the pair (m, ei ) is exceptional in gi for every i. Thus, the classification problem for\nexceptional pairs reduces to the case, when g is simple.\nThe pair (1,0) is obviously exceptional. For all other exceptional pairs, m > 1 and e 6= 0. On\nthe other hand, a pair (m, e) with m > h(g) is exceptional if and only if e is regular (=principal).\nThe exceptional pairs of these two types are called trivial.\nA nilpotent element e \u2208 g is said to be of principal type if it is principal in l(e). We shall prove\n(see Section 2) that any exceptional nilpotent element e is of principal type.\n1.4. The main result of this paper is the following classification theorem.\nTheorem 3. For any simple Lie algebra g and any positive integer m, there exists at most one\nnilpotent orbit Ad(G)e in g such that the pair (m, e) is exceptional. All non-trivial exceptional pairs\n(m, e) in the classical and exceptional simple Lie algebras are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.\n(In fact, Table 1 contains also some trivial exceptional pairs.)\nIn Table 1, the nilpotent element e is given by the corresponding partition of N , constituted\nby the orders of its Jordan blocks. In Table 2, it is given by the type of the derived algebra l(e)\u2032\nof l(e). In the cases of G2 and F4 , tildas mean that the root system of the corresponding regular\nsubalgebra consists of short roots.\n\n\fON EXCEPTIONAL NILPOTENTS IN SEMISIMPLE LIE ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\nFormulas for the numbers d(m) in the classical case are given in 4.3.

If (m, e) is an exceptional pair, then m > h(e) and\nd(h(e)) 6 dim Z(e) = d(m) 6 d(h(e)),\nwhence d(m) = d(h(e)) and (h(e), e) is also an exceptional pair. A priori it is possible that\nm > h(e). This really happens for regular e, where any m > h(e) = h(g) fits. Apart from this\ncase, this never happens in the exceptional Lie algebras. In the classical Lie algebras, this happens\nonly in the following two cases:\n1) g = sp2n , n even, e is defined by the partition (n, n), m = n + 1 (> n = h(e));\n2) g = so2n+1 , e is defined by the partition (2n \u2212 1, 1, 1), m = 2n \u2212 1 (> 2n \u2212 2 = h(e)).\n1.6. It follows from the tables in [1] that the centralizer of any exceptional nilpotent element in\na simple Lie algebra g 6= soN is connected. For g = soN , it may have at most two connected\ncomponents.\n\n\f4\n\nA. G. ELASHVILI, V. G. KAC, E. B. VINBERG\n\n1.7.

Jibladze for providing technical help in the preparation of this\nmanuscript.\nThis work was mainly done during the stay of the first and third authors at the University of\nBielefeld in July of 2008, supported by SFB 701.

Definition of exceptional pairs\n2.1. The original definition of exceptional pairs was given in terms of W-algebras. However,\nTheorem 2.32 of [7] permits to give an equivalent definition in internal terms of the algebra g.\nFor a nilpotent element e of a semisimple Lie algebra g and a positive integer m, denote by\nS(m, e) the set of all regular semisimple elements s of L(e) such that Ad(s)m =id. According to\n[7], the pair (m, e) is exceptional if e is of principal type, S(m, e) 6= \u2205, and\nmin\n\ns\u2208S(m,e)\n\ndim Z(s) = dim Z(e).\n\nRemark. In fact, Kac and Wakimoto require in addition that m should be coprime to the \"lacety\"\nof g, which is 1 for types A,D,E, 2 for B,C,F, and 3 for G. We will disregard this requirement,\nwhich is natural from the point of view of W -algebras but looks artificial from the point of view\nof the theory of semisimple Lie algebras and, besides, it does not facilitate the classification. One\ncan note, however, that this requirement is violated in cases 1) and 2) of subsection 1.5, so if we\nadopt it, then for any non-principal nilpotent element e \u2208 g there will be at most one positive\ninteger m such that the pair (m, e) is exceptional, as was conjectured in [7].\nApplying Corollary to Theorem 1 to L(e), we obtain that S(m, e) 6= \u2205 if and only if h(e) 6 m,\nwhich is just condition (I) of the definition of an exceptional pair given in the introduction.\nLet us fix a maximal torus T \u2282 G and a set of simple roots \u03b11 ,..., \u03b1n with respect to it. Fix\nalso a principal sl2 -subalgebra spr with hpr contained in the Weyl chamber in t =Lie T . Let sm be\nthe element of the corresponding subgroup S pr defined as in the introduction. One may assume\nthat L(e) contains T and, moreover, that l(e) is generated by t =Lie T and some positive and the\nopposite negative simple root vectors. Then sm \u2208 T \u2282 L(e), and the description of the action of\n\u03c3m =Ad(sm ) given in the introduction shows that if h(e) 6 m, then sm is a regular element of\nL(e), so sm \u2208 S(m, e). Now, Theorem 1 implies that\nmin\n\ns\u2208S(m,e)\n\ndim Z(s) = dim Z(sm ) = d(m).\n\nThus, the dimension condition in the above definition of an exceptional pair reduces to condition\n(II) of the definition given in the introduction.\n2.2. Let e \u2208 g be a nilpotent element with h(e) 6 m, and let e0 be a principal nilpotent element\nof l(e). Then l(e0 ) = l(e), so h(e0 ) = h(e) 6 m. Further, e lies in the closure of the L(e)-orbit of\ne0 and, the more, in the closure of the G-orbit of e0 . Hence,\ndim Z(e) > dim Z(e0 ),\nthe equality taking place only if e \u2208Ad(G)e0 .\nAccording to Theorem 2 (which will be proved in Sections 4,5 together with the classification of\nexceptional pairs), dim Z(e0 ) > d(m). Hence, the equality dim Z(e) = d(m) can only take place\nif e \u2208Ad(G)e0 .\n\n\fON EXCEPTIONAL NILPOTENTS IN SEMISIMPLE LIE ALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\nSuppose that e =Ad(g)e0 for some g \u2208 G. Multiplying g from the left by some element of Z(e),\none may assume that Ad(g)l(e) = l(e). Then Ad(g) leaves invariant the principal nilpotent orbit\nin l(e). Hence, e lies in this orbit, i.e., e is a principal nilpotent element in l(e).\nThus, the original definition of an exceptional pair given in [7] is in fact equivalent to the\ndefinition given in the introduction.\n3. Proof of Theorem 1\n3.1. Serre's proof of Theorem 1 is based on the product formula for the character \u03c6\u03bb of the\nrestriction to S pr of the irreducible representation of G with highest weight \u03bb. Apparently, this\nformula was already known in the 60s but was not explicitly written at that time. A more recent\nreference is [5], formula (3.29).\nDenote by s(t) the element of S pr corresponding to the matrix diag(t, t\u22121 ) \u2208SL2 . Then the\nformula is\nY th\u03bb+\u03c1,\u03b1\u2228 i \u2212 1\n\u2212h\u03bb,\u03c1\u2228 i\n\u03c6\u03bb (s(t)) = t\n,\nth\u03c1,\u03b1\u2228 i \u2212 1\n\u03b1>0\n\nwhere \u03c1 is, as usual, the half-sum of positive roots, \u03b1\u2228 denotes the coroot corresponding to \u03b1,\nand \u03c1\u2228 is the half-sum of positive coroots. It is obtained from the Weyl character formula; one\nshould only note that the Weyl denominator formula (for the dual root system) is applicable to\nthe numerator if one is only interested in the restriction of the character to S pr .\nClearly, the product in the right hand side must be a polynomial in t. Let us represent it in\na little different form. First, note that h\u03c1, \u03b1\u2228 i is nothing else than the height ht(\u03b1\u2228 ) of \u03b1\u2228 , since\n\u2228\n\u2228\nh\u03c1, \u03b1\u2228\ni i = 1 for every simple coroot \u03b1i . Second, h\u03bb + \u03c1, \u03b1 i can be interpreted as the \"weighted\n\u2228\n\u2228\nheight\" of \u03b1 if one assigns the weight li = h\u03bb + \u03c1, \u03b1i i = h\u03bb, \u03b1\u2228\ni i + 1 to each simple coroot \u03b1i .\n\u2228\n\u2228\nDenote the so defined weighted height of \u03b1 by htl (\u03b1 ), where l = (l1 , ..., ln ). Note that l1 , ..., ln\nmay be arbitrary positive integers. In particular, ht(\u03b1\u2228 ) =ht1 (\u03b1\u2228 ), where 1 = (1, ..., 1).\nFinally, replacing the root system of G with its dual, we come to the following\nProposition 2.1 [12, Theorem 1]. For any set l = (l1 , ..., ln ) of positive integers, the polynomial\nY\nPl (t) =\n(thtl (\u03b1) \u2212 1)\n\u03b1>0\n\nis divisible by the polynomial\nP1 (t) =\n\nY\n\n(tht(\u03b1) \u2212 1).\n\n\u03b1>0\n\n3.2. Now we are ready to prove Theorem 1.\nLet \u03c3 be an inner automorphism of g satisfying the condition \u03c3 m =id for some positive integer\nm. One may assume that \u03c3 is a conjugation by some element s \u2208 T . Then\n\u03c3(e\u03b1i ) = \u03b5lmi e\u03b1i (li \u2208 {1, ..., m}),\nwhere \u03b5m = exp 2\u03c0i\nm , and, hence, for any \u03b1 > 0,\nl (\u03b1)\n\u03c3(e\u03b1 ) = \u03b5ht\ne\u03b1 ,\nm\n\nwhere l = (l1 , ..., ln ). This implies that\ndim g\u03c3 = rk g + 2#{\u03b1 > 0 : m | htl (\u03b1)}.\nIn particular,\nd(m) = rk g + 2#{\u03b1 > 0 : m | ht(\u03b1)}.\nClearly, #{\u03b1 > 0 : m | ht(\u03b1)} is the multiplicity of \u03b5m as a root of the polynomial P1 (t), while\n#{\u03b1 > 0 : m | htl (\u03b1)} is the multiplicity of \u03b5m as a root of the polynomial Pl (t). According to\nProposition 2.1, the latter is not less than the former, whence Theorem 1 follows.\n\n\f6\n\nA. G. ELASHVILI, V. G. KAC, E. B. VINBERG\n\n3.3. In addition, let us prove some useful monotonicity properties of the function m 7\u2192 d(m).\nProposition 2.2. If m\u2032 < m, then d(m\u2032 ) > d(m). Moreover, if m\u2032 | m, m\u2032 6= m < h(g), then\nd(m\u2032 ) > d(m).\nProof. The second inequality immediately follows from the preceding formula for d(m) and the\ndefinition of h(g).\nThe first inequality follows from the well-known fact that the number #{\u03b1 > 0 : ht(\u03b1) = k} is\nmonotonically decreasing in k (see [3, 8]). Indeed, if m\u2032 < m, then, for any k,\n#{\u03b1 > 0 : ht(\u03b1) = km\u2032 } > #{\u03b1 > 0 : ht(\u03b1) = km},\nwhence the required inequality follows.\n\n\u0003\n\n4. Classification: the classical Lie algebras\n4.1. Our strategy in proving Theorems 2 and 3 will be the following. For each simple Lie algebra\ng we consider the set Nil(g) of its nilpotent orbits partially ordered by the inclusion of the closures. Then for each m < h(g) we consider the subset Nilm (g) of nilpotent orbits Ad(G)e with\nh(e) 6 m and determine its maximal elements, which we call essential nilpotent orbits. (They are\nautomatically nilpotent orbits of principal type: see Section 2.) We check that dimZ(e) > d(m)\nfor any essential nilpotent orbit and thereby prove Theorem 2. At the same time, we find all\nessential nilpotent orbits Ad(G)e \u2208Nilm (g) with dim Z(e) = d(m) and thus obtain a classification\nof exceptional pairs. It turns out that for each m there is at most one essential nilpotent orbit\nwith this property.\n4.2. First of all, we will deduce some general formulas for the dimensions of the centralizers of\nsemisimple elements in the classical groups G = SLN , SpN , SON .\nLet s \u2208 SLN be a semisimple element with eigenvalues of multiplicities n1 , ..., np (so n1 + ... +\nnp = N ). Denote by K the sum of squares of these multiplicities. The centralizer of s in GLn is\nisomorphic to GLn1 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 GLnp and, hence, its dimension is equal to K. The dimension of the\ncentralizer Z(s) of s in SLN is one less. Thus,\ndim Z(s) = K \u2212 1 for G = SLN .\n\n(1)\n\nIf s \u2208 SpN or SON , the eigenvalues of s distinct from \u00b11 decompose into pairs of mutually\ninverse ones. Let n1 , ..., nq be the common multiplicities of the eigenvalues of these pairs, and let\nn+ and n\u2212 be the multiplicities of the eigenvalues 1 and \u22121 (so 2(n1 + ... + nq ) + n+ + n\u2212 = N ).\nAs above, denote by K the sum of squares of all the multiplicities, that is,\nK = 2(n21 + ... + n2q ) + n2+ + n2\u2212 .\nFor s \u2208 SpN the centralizer of s in SpN is isomorphic to GLn1 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 GLnq \u00d7 Spn+ \u00d7 Spn\u2212 .\nHence,\ndim Z(s) = n21 + ... + n2q +\n\nn+ (n+ + 1) n\u2212 (n\u2212 + 1)\n+\n,\n2\n2\n\nwhich can be written in the form\n2 dim Z(s) = K + n+ + n\u2212 for G = SpN .\n\n(2)\n\nSimilarly, for s \u2208 SON the connected centralizer of s in SON is isomorphic to GLn1 \u00d7 ... \u00d7\nGLnq \u00d7 SOn+ \u00d7 SOn\u2212 , whence\n2 dim Z(s) = K \u2212 n+ \u2212 n\u2212 for G = SON .\n\n(3)\n\n\fON EXCEPTIONAL NILPOTENTS IN SEMISIMPLE LIE ALGEBRAS\n\n7\n\n4.3.

Hence, if m is odd, -1 is not\nan eigenvalue, while n+ = q or q + 1; but for symmetry reason n+ must be odd, which permits\nto determine n+ uniquely. If m is even, both n+ and n\u2212 are equal to q or q + 1. For symmetry\nreason, n+ + n\u2212 must be odd, whence n+ + n\u2212 = 2q + 1.\nLet now g = soN with N even. It follows from our definition of K(m) that K = K(m) if q is\nodd, and K = K(m) + 2 if q is even. As in the preceding case, the eigenvalues of sm are m-th\nroots of 1 (see (5)). If m is odd, -1 is not an eigenvalue, while the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 1\nis even and equals q + 1 or q + 2. If m is even, we have n+ = q + 1 or q + 2 and n\u2212 = q or q + 1;\nbut for symmetry reason n+ and n\u2212 are even, so n+ + n\u2212 = 2q + 2, which gives 4).\n\u0003\n4.4. In this subsection, we collect some well-known facts about nilpotent orbits in the classical\nsimple Lie algebras g = slN , spN , soN . For more details and proofs, see, for example, [2].\nA nilpotent orbit Ad(G)e in g is uniquely defined by the partition (n1 , ...np ) of N constituted by\nthe orders of Jordan blocks of e (acting on F N ), with the only reservation that in the case g = soN\nwith N \u2261 0 (mod 4), the partitions with all even parts correspond to two different nilpotent orbits\npermuted by an outer automorphism of g. The partition (n1 , ..., np ) may be arbitrary for g = slN\nbut in the other cases is subject to some restrictions. Namely, for g = spN the multiplicity of each\nodd part of the partition should be even, while for g = soN the multiplicity of each even part\nshould be even; we shall call such partitions admissible for g. We agree to think of the parts of a\npartition as of the rows of a Young diagram going from the bottom to the top and aligned from\nthe left.\nDenote by K(e) the sum of squares of the parts of the partition dual to (n1 , ..., np ) (constituted\nby the columns of the corresponding Young diagram). Then the dimension of the centralizer Z(e)\nof e in G is given by the following formulas:\ndim Z(e) = K(e) \u2212 1 for g = slN ,\n\n(6)\n\n2 dim Z(e) = K(e) + #{i : ni odd} for g = spN ,\n\n(7)\n\n2 dim Z(e) = K(e) \u2212 #{i : ni odd} for g = soN .\n\n(8)\n\nTo describe the partial order on the set Nil(g) of nilpotent orbits in g, let us introduce the\nnotion of a \"simple crumbling\" of a partition (n1 , ..., np ) as the transition to a partition of the\nform\n(n1 , ...ni\u22121 , ni + 1, ni+1 , ..., nj\u22121 , nj \u2212 1, nj+1 , ..., np ),\nprovided ni\u22121 > ni and nj > nj+1 .

Then Ad(G)e lies in the closure of Ad(G)e\u2032 if and only if the partition (n\u20321 , ..., n\u2032p\u2032 )\ncan be obtained from (n1 , ...np ) by consecutive simple crumblings (without assuming that all the\nintermediate partitions should be admissible) (see [2]).\n\n\fON EXCEPTIONAL NILPOTENTS IN SEMISIMPLE LIE ALGEBRAS\n\n9\n\n4.5. As was explained in Section 2, for our purposes it suffices to consider only nilpotent elements\nof principal type. Let us describe such elements in terms of partitions (cf. [7]).\nFirst of all, in all the classical simple Lie algebras, but soN with N even, a principal nilpotent\nelement is defined by the trivial partition (N ). In soN with N even, it is defined by the partition\n(N \u2212 1, 1).\nLet e \u2208 slN be a nilpotent element defined by a partition (n1 , ..., np ). Then e is conjugate to a\nprincipal nilpotent element of the Levi subalgebra consisting of the matrices\nA = diag(A1 , ..., Ap ) (A1 \u2208 gln1 , ..., Ap \u2208 glnp )\nwith tr A = 0. Thus, all nilpotent elements in glN are of principal type.\nIn g = spN or soN , any Levi subalgebra l consists of the matrices of the form\nA = diag(A1 , ..., As , A0 , \u2212A\u2032s , ..., \u2212A\u20321 )\n(A1 \u2208 gln1 , ..., As \u2208 glns , A0 \u2208 spn0 or son0 , resp.; (2(n1 + ... + ns ) + n0 = N ),\nwhere \u2032 denotes the transposition with respect to the second diagonal. Thus, l is isomorphic to\ngln1 + ... + glns + spn0 or gln1 + ... + glns + son0 , resp. This implies the following characterization\nof nilpotent elements of principal type in terms of the corresponding partition (n1 , ..., np ):\n1) for g = spN , the multiplicities of all parts of the partition, except for at most one even\npart, should be even;\n2) for g = soN , N odd, the multiplicities of all parts of the partition, except for at most one\nodd part, should be even;\n3) for soN , N even, either all the multiplicities are even, or the multiplicities of 1 and some\nother odd part are odd, while all the other multiplicities are even.\nWe shall refer to such partitions as to (admissible) partitions of principal type.\nIt follows from this description and the table of the Coxeter numbers of simple Lie algebras (see\nthe introduction) that, for g = slN or spN , the Coxeter number of a nilpotent element of principal\ntype corresponding to the partition (n1 , ..., np ), is equal to n1 (the maximum of the parts of the\npartition). For g = soN , it is equal to n1 or n1 \u2212 1, the latter taking place iff n1 is odd and\nn1 > n2 .\n4.6. Case g = slN . In this case, Nilm (g) consists of the nilpotent orbits defined by the partitions\nall whose parts do not exceed m. Any such partition crumbles to the partition (m, ..., m, r) with\n0 6 r 6 m \u2212 1, which is thereby the only maximal element of Nilm (g). Let Ad(G)e be the\ncorresponding nilpotent orbit. Then, by (6) and Proposition 3.1.1),\ndim Z(e) = r(q + 1)2 + (m \u2212 r)q 2 \u2212 1 = d(m).\nThis proves Theorems 2 and 3 for slN (cf. [7]).\n4.7. Case g = spN . In this case, the nilpotent orbits of principal type in Nilm (g) are defined by\nthe partitions of principal type all whose parts do not exceed m. Any such partition crumbles to\none of the following partitions of the same class:\n1) (m, ..., m, r) with 0 6 r 6 m;\n| {z }\neven\n\n2) (m, ..., m, s, s) with\n| {z }\n\nm\n2\n\n+ 1 6 s 6 m \u2212 1;\n\neven\n\n3) (m, ..., m, m \u2212 1, s, s) with m odd, 1 6 s 6\n| {z }\n\nm\u22123\n2 ;\n\neven\n\n4) (m, ..., m, s, s) with m even, 1 6 s 6 m \u2212 1.\n| {z }\nodd\n\nApplying (7) and Proposition 3.1.2) to partitions 1)-4), we obtain Theorems 2 and 3 for spN .\nThe calculations can be simplified if one notes that the difference dim Z(e) \u2212 d(m) does not change\nwhen deleting 2k parts equal to m from the partition (and diminishing N by 2km).

In case 1) this reduces the consideration to the partition (r), which corresponds\nto the principal nilpotent orbit in sor ; hence, in this case the pair (m, e) is always exceptional if\nm is odd, while if m is even, it is exceptional only in the trivial case when N = r (and, hence,\nm > h(e)).\nIn case 4), a direct calculation shows that for s < m\n2\n(\n0, if s is even,\n2(dim Z(e) \u2212 d(m)) = 2s \u2212\n> 0,\n2, if s is odd\nthe equality taking place iff s = 0 or 1.

To classify exceptional pairs in the exceptional simple Lie algebras, we need a formula for\ncomputing the numbers d(m). Let g be a simple Lie algebra of rank n, and spr be a principal\nsl2 -subalgebra of g. It is well-known [8] that the adjoint representation of spr in g decomposes\ninto a sum of n irreducible representations of dimensions 2m1 + 1, ..., 2mn + 1, where m1 , ..., mn\nare the exponents of g. Clearly, the eigenspace of ad(hpr ) corresponding to the eigenvalue 2k > 0\nis spanned by the positive root vectors e\u03b1 with ht(\u03b1) = k. It follows that\n#{\u03b1 > 0 : ht(\u03b1) = k} = #{i : mi > k},\nHence,\n#{\u03b1 > 0 : m|ht(\u03b1)} =\n\nn h\nX\nmi i\ni=1\n\nand (see the formula for d(m) in Section 3)\nd(m) = n + 2\n\nm\n\nn h\nX\nmi i\ni=1\n\nm\n\n(cf. [10].)\nMaking use of the above formula, it is easy to compute the numbers d(m) for all exceptional\nalgebras. They are given in the tables on Fig. 2-6.\n5.2. A classification of nilpotent elements e in the exceptional Lie algebras follows from the classification of sl2 -triples obtained in [3]. The corresponding Levi subalgebras l(e) and, hence, the\nCoxeter numbers h(e) also can be derived from the tables of that paper. The centralizers z(e)\nwere determined in [4]. The inclusion relation for the closures of nilpotent orbits was described in\n[11] (see also [9]).\nHaving all this information, it is easy to find the nilpotent orbits that do not lie in the closure\nof another nilpotent orbit with the same Coxeter number. The Hasse diagrams for the sets of\nsuch orbits are depicted on Fig 2-6, where each involved orbit Ad(G)e is given by the type of l(e)\u2032 ,\nand the dimension of z(e) is indicated in parentheses. For each m, the set of orbits with Coxeter\nnumber m is situated in the corresponding stripe between dotted lines.\n\nG2\nm\nd(m)\n\n2 3\n6 4\n\n4 5\n4 4\n\nm (d(m))\n6 (2)\n2 (6)\n\nG2 (2)\nA1 (8)\n\n1 (14)\n\nf1 (6)\nA\n\n0 (14)\n\nFig. 2\n\n\f12\n\nA.
