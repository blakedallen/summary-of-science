Introduction\nTheoretic foundation of quantum computation and quantum information [NC] has been postulated through the language of quantum\nmechanics. At the beginning of the development of quantum mechanics Schr\u00f6ginger pointed out the unitary freedom of the quantum system\n[S, U], which is one of the spotlights in the whole theory and has been\nused in many applications in later developments. In [HJW] the freedom of purification of quantum states was studied with help of Schmidt\ndecomposition. Furthermore the probability distributions given by a\ngiven density matrix are characterized by majorization [N]. These results have played an important role in quantum statistics, quantum\ncomputation and quantum information.\nQuantum entanglement is one of the key issues in quantum computation, and local unitary invariance is an importance aspect in quantum\nentanglement and their applications. For instance, several fast algorithms are discovered based on special properties of local invariance\nand quantum entanglements. The maximum entanglement can also\nbe achieved via local unitary action. Local unitary transformations\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary: 81-08; Secondary: 81R05,\n22E46, 22E70.\nKey words and phrases. Group theory, quantum computation, induced\nrepresentations.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nNAIHUAN JING\n\nhave also been used for fractional entanglement and in other properties (cf. [HHH]). In various investigations of local unitary equivalence lots of efforts have been made in seeking possible invariants\n[AFG, TLT, ZSB, ACFW]. There have also been results on non-local\nunitary equivalence [DC] in exploring feasible quantum gates. In [YLF]\na geometric class was proposed to study the problem for two partite\nquantum states and it has been shown that two quantum states are\nequivalent if and only if their representation classes are the same. In\n[FJ] we have proposed a new operational method to study local unitary\nequivalence of density matrices and the relationship with separability.\nIt is clear that in classification of equivalent density matrices one first\nneeds to see whether two density operators have the same eigenvalues\nor not. Therefore one should separate the easy task of comparing\neigenvalues from the problem and focus on other invariants of unitary\noperations. In the current paper we apply this strategy to a larger\nquantum system consisting of several quantum sub-systems and study\ntheir unitary properties from the viewpoints of both global and local\npictures.\nWe first look at density matrices with specified spectrum of eigenvalues and study the properties of the quantum systems using grouptheoretic methods. The local unitary properties are investigated with\nthe help of fixed point subgroups of the concerned Lie group and we\nthen set up a one-to-one correspondence between classes of local unitary\nequivalences and double cosets of the unitary group U(n) by the additive and multiplicative Young subgroups. Next we recast the space\nof the equivalence classes in terms of induced representations of the\nYoung subgroups and show their deep connections with homogeneous\nspaces of unitary groups.\nOne of our main results shows that local unitary equivalence depends\nonly on the multiplicities of the eigenvalues and is independent from the\nactual values of the eigenvalues. This means that with given spectrum\nof the density matrices the local unitary equivalence is determined by\nthe combinatorics of the quantum states. We hope that the combinatorics and invariant theory will shed light in further investigation of\nlocal unitary properties and entanglement of quantum states.\n\n2. Local unitary equivalence\nLet H be a Hilbert space affording the quantum system. If the\nquantum system is in a number of normalized quantum states |\u03c8i i\nwith probability pi , then the density operator for the quantum system\n\n\fON CLASSES OF LOCAL UNITARY TRANSFORMATIONS\n\n3\n\nis the convex combination\n\u03c1=\n\nX\n\npi |\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |,\n\ni\n\nP\nwhere i pi = 1. Equivalently density operators are characterized as\nnon-negative operators on the Hilbert space with unit trace.\nAmong all physically possible quantum systems afforded by H, one\nneeds to judge whether two systems are distinct or not. To study\nthe equivalence of various quantum systems on H, one only needs to\nconsider the unitary linear group U(n) over C. Suppose two density\nmatrices \u03c1i have the same set of eigenvalues and their sets of multiplicities for each eigenvalue are also the same. Let the corresponding\n(j)\n(j)\n(orthonormal) eigenstates be |\u03c6(\u03bbi )i and |\u03c8(\u03bbi )i respectively, where\nj = 1, * * * , mi , the multiplicity of the eigenvalue \u03bbi . Then we can write\nX\n(j)\n(j)\n\u03c11 =\n\u03bbi |\u03c6(\u03bbi )ih\u03c6(\u03bbi )|,\nij\n\n\u03c12 =\n\nX\n\n(j)\n\n(j)\n\n\u03bbi |\u03c8(\u03bbi )ih\u03c8(\u03bbi )|.\n\nij\n\n(j)\n\nWe define g to be the linear transformation on H sending |\u03c6(\u03bbi )i 7\u2192\n(j)\n|\u03c8(\u03bbi )i, then g \u2208 U(n) due to orthogonality of the eigenstates. Then\none easily checks that\n\u03c12 = g\u03c11 g \u22121 = g\u03c11 g \u2020 .\nIn other words density matrices with similar spectral decomposition\nare unitary equivalent and all physical features of the quantum system\nare captured by properties of the unitary group U(n).\nThe above discussion can also be viewed in terms of group action. Let\nD(n) be the set of density matrices on the Hilbert space H of dimension\nn. The evolution of the density operator \u03c1 is given by \u03c1 \u2212\u2192 g\u03c1g \u2020,\nwhere g = g(t) \u2208 U(n) and \u2020 is transpose and conjugation. Clearly\ng\u03c1g \u2020 is positive and tr(g\u03c1g \u2020) = tr(\u03c1) = 1. We will adopt the standard\nconvention in group theory to write hgh\u22121 = g h for g, h \u2208 G.\nLemma 2.1. The kernel of the action U(n) \u00d7 D(n) \u2212\u2192 D(n) is\n{ei\u03b8 I|\u03b8 \u2208 R} \u2264 U(n).\nProof. Suppose g\u03c1g \u2020 = \u03c1 for all density matrices \u03c1. If \u03c1 is any diagonal\nmatrix with distinct eigenvalues, then g must be diagonal by computation. A generalized (or signed) permutation matrix is one that each\nrow or column has only one and only non-zero entry and this non-zero\nentry is 1 or \u22121. One notes that any matrix commutes with a generalized permutation matrix must be diagonal. To show that g = aI\n\n\f4\n\nNAIHUAN JING\n\nwith a = ei\u03b8 a complex number of unit modulus, we can take positive\ngeneralized permutation matrix, then all diagonal entries of g must be\nequal.\n\u0003\nFor \u03c1 \u2208 D(n) we define the invariant subgroup U\u03c1 by U\u03c1 = {g \u2208\nU(n)| g\u03c1g \u2020 = \u03c1}. As g \u2208 U(n) is unitary: gg \u2020 = g \u2020 g = I, we have immediately that g\u03c1g \u2020 = \u03c1 iff g\u03c1 = \u03c1g. The next statement is immediate\nfrom definition.\nLemma 2.2. For any h \u2208 GL(n) one has U\u03c1h = hU\u03c1 h\u2020 = (U\u03c1 )h .\nLet \u03c1 be a density matrix of size n \u00d7 n and thus is diagonalizable\ndue to hermiticity. According to basic theory in linear algebra [L] there\nexists a unitary matrix g \u2208 U(n) such that\n\u03c1 = g diag(a1 I\u03bb1 , * * * , al I\u03bbl )g \u2020,\nwhere \u03bbi are non-negative integers such that \u03bb1 + * * * + \u03bbl = n. We can\nfurther suppose that \u03bbi are arranged in a descending order: \u03bb1 \u2265 * * * \u2265\n\u03bbl > 0, thus \u03bb is a partition of n. Here l is the number of parts of \u03bb.\nDefinition 2.3. We say a density matrix \u03c1 is of type \u03bb, a partition of\nn, if \u03c1 has eigenvalue multiplicities: \u03bb1 , * * * , \u03bbl , where \u03bb1 + * * * + \u03bbl = n.\nTwo density matrices are equivalent if they are related by a unitary\ntransformation: \u03c11 = g\u03c12 g \u2020, g \u2208 U(n). This is in agreement with the\nequivalence relation given by the group action of U(n) on D(n). Thus\nthe invariant subgroups of equivalent density matrices are conjugate in\nU(n). We will call the set of equivalent density matrices of type \u03bb the\nequivalent class of type \u03bb, and denote the class by [\u03bb].\nProposition 2.1. If \u03c1 = diag(a1 I\u03bb1 , * * * , al I\u03bbl ) is a density matrix,\nthen U\u03c1 = U(\u03bb1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 U(\u03bbl ). More generally if \u03c1 is of type \u03bb =\n(\u03bb1 , * * * , \u03bbl ), then U\u03c1 = gU(\u03bb1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 U(\u03bbl )g \u2020 for some g \u2208 U(n).\nProof. If \u03c1 = diag(a1 I\u03bb1 , * * * , al I\u03bbl ), it follows from direct computation\nthat U\u03c1 = U(\u03bb1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 U(\u03bbl ). Then for a general density matrix \u03c1\nof type \u03bb, we have that \u03c1 = gdiag(a1 I\u03bb1 , * * * , al I\u03bbl )g \u2020 (g \u2208 U = U(n)),\nthen the result follows from Lemma 2.2.\n\u0003\nThe classes of density matrices can be characterized by the group\naction.\nTheorem 2.4. Let [\u03bb] be the equivalent class of density matrices of\ntype \u03bb, then [\u03bb] \u2243 U/U\u03c1 , where \u03c1 is some density matrix of type \u03bb.\n\n\fON CLASSES OF LOCAL UNITARY TRANSFORMATIONS\n\n5\n\nProof. Let U = U(n). The action U \u00d7[\u03bb] \u2212\u2192 [\u03bb] given by (g, \u03c1) 7\u2192 g\u03c1g \u2020\nis transitive. As the class [\u03bb] = {\u03c1g |g \u2208 U} for a fixed density matrix\n\u03c1, we see that\n\u03c1g1 = \u03c1g2 \u21d0\u21d2 g1 g2\u22121 \u2208 U\u03c1 ,\ntherefore U/U\u03c1 \u2243 [\u03bb(\u03c1)]. It follows from Proposition 2.1 that U/U\u03c1 =\nU/gU\u03bb(\u03c1) g \u22121 \u2243 U/U\u03bb(\u03c1)\n\u0003\nWe now consider local unitary equivalence. Let Hi be two Hilbert\nspaces with dimensions ni . We say two density operators \u03c1i on the\nspace H = H1 \u2297 H2 are equivalent under local transformation iff \u03c11 =\n(g1 \u2297 g2 )\u03c12 (g1 \u2297 g2 )\u2020 for some gi \u2208 U(ni ) \u2264 End(Hi ). We recall that \u03c1i\nare (globally) equivalent if \u03c11 = g\u03c12 g \u2020 for g \u2208 U(n) \u2264 End(H), where\nn = n1 n2 . More generally, for multi-partite cases the local unitary\ngroup is Un = U(n1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 U(nr ), where ni = dim(Hi ).\nTheorem 2.5. Let H = H1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Hr be the global Hilbert space\nwith dim(Hi ) = ni , and Un as above. Then the type \u03bb equivalent multipartite mixed states under local equivalence are in one-to-one correspondent to double cosets of the unitary group U(n) by the Young subgroups:\nUn \\U/U\u03bb , where U\u03bb = U(\u03bb1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 U(\u03bbl ). Moreover, the representative of the double coset determined by the density matrix \u03c1 is given by\nthe matrix of the orthonormal eigenstates of \u03c1.\nProof. Globally equivalent density matrices are determined by their\neigenvalue spectrum and multiplicities. The class of (locally) equivalent\ndensity matrices of type \u03bb consists of\ng\u039bg \u2020\nwhere \u039b = diag(a1 I\u03bb1 , * * * , al I\u03bbl ) and g is a unitary matrix consisting\nof orthonormal eigenstates of \u03c1. Here \u039b is fixed. When two density\nmatrices \u03c1i = gi \u039bgi\u2020 are local unitary equivalent, then \u03c11 = k\u03c12 k \u22121 for\nsome k \u2208 Un . It then follows that\ng1 \u039bg1\u2020 = kg2 \u039bg2\u2020 k \u2020 =\u21d2 g1\u22121 kg2 = c \u2208 U\u039b ,\nand U\u039b = U\u03bb = U(\u03bb1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 U(\u03bbl ) by Proposition 2.1. Therefore\nUn g1 U\u03bb = Un g2 U\u03bb .\nConversely, suppose two double cosets Un gi U\u03bb are the same. Then\ng1 = kg2 c for some k \u2208 Un and c \u2208 U\u03bb . It follows that g1\u22121 kg2 = c\u22121 \u2208\nU\u03bb , thus g1 \u039bg1\u2020 = kg2 \u039bg2\u2020 k \u2020 . It is clear that \u03c11 = g1 \u039bg1\u2020 gives rise to\na density matrix and \u03c12 = g2 \u039bg2\u2020 gives rise to a globally equivalent\ndensity matrix (as \u03c11 = \u03c1k2 ). Their corresponding classes (under local\nequivalence) are also equal:\n[g1 \u039bg1\u2020 ] = [g2 \u039bg2\u2020 ].\n\n\f6\n\nNAIHUAN JING\n\n\u0003\n3. Induced representations\nLet \u03bb be a partition of n, n = \u03bb1 + * * * + \u03bbl , and n be a factorization\nof n, n = n1 * * * nr , where n is the dimension of the underlying (global)\nHilbert space. The Young subgroup U\u03bb associated with the partition \u03bb\nis the direct product U(\u03bb1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 U(\u03bbl ). From our previous discussion\nit is clear that one also needs to consider the multiplicative Young\nsubgroup Un = U(n1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 U(nr ) associated to the factorization n\nof n. The additive Young subgroup U\u03bb = U(\u03bb1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 U(\u03bbl ) can be\nimbedded into U(n) in the canonical manner:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\ng1\n..\n\uf8f8 \u2208 U(n),\n(g1 , * * * , gl ) \u2208 U(\u03bbi ) 7\u2192 g1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 gl = \uf8ed\n.\ngl\nwhile the multiplicative Young subgroup Un = U(n1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 U(nr ) is\nimbedded into U(n) via tensor product\ng1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 gr \u2208 Un 7\u2192 g1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 gr \u2208 U(n).\nAs we have seen in Section 2 the double cosets given by the Young\nsubgroups U\u03bb and multiplicative Young subgroup Un are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence of quantum multi-partite systems with dimensions ni .\nWe now reformulate this correspondence in terms of representations of\nthe unitary group. We can restrict ourself to the special unitary group\nwithout loss of generality. Let G = SU(n) and H = SU\u03bb , and it is\nclear that H is a closed subgroup of the compact Lie group G.\nLet C be the trivial representation of the subgroup H. The induced\nrepresentation IndG\nH C, as a vector space, is the space of all complex\ncontinuous functions on H satisfying the condition:\nf (gh) = h\u22121 f (g),\n\ng \u2208 G, h \u2208 H.\n\nThe action of G on the induced representation is given by\n(3.1)\n\n(g * f )(x) = f (g \u22121 x),\n\ng, x \u2208 G.\n\n0\nThe induced representation IndG\nH C is isomorphic to C (G/H, C), the\nspace of continuous functions on the cosets G/H [BD]. Here the action\nis the left translation: L(g)f (x) = f (g \u22121x). The canonical basis of\nthe representation is given by characteristic functions \u03c6gH , indexed by\nright cosets G/H. Here\n(\n1, g \u22121g \u2032 \u2208 H\n(3.2)\n\u03c6gH (g \u2032H) =\n.\n0, g \u22121g \u2032 \u2208\n/H\n\n\fON CLASSES OF LOCAL UNITARY TRANSFORMATIONS\n\n7\n\nThe induced representation IndG\nH C is essentially equivalent to the set\nof unitary classes of density matrices as seen from the following observation.\nExample 3.1. Suppose n = 1 * n is the factorization of n, then local\nunitary equivalence coincides with global unitary equivalence. The double cosets Un \\U/U\u03bb reduces to cosets U/U\u03bb . The unitary equivalence\nclasses (with same set of spectrum) are also in one-to-one correspondence of the set of partitions P(n):\nn = \u03bb1 + * * * + \u03bbl .\nEach equivalence class is represented by a homogeneous space of the\nunitary group U(n) determined by the partition \u03bb. The generating\nfunction of the number of unitary equivalence classes is given by [M]\n\u221e\nX\nn=0\n\nn\n\n#(equiv class)q =\n\n\u221e\nY\n\n1\n.\nn\n1\n\u2212\nq\nn=1\n\nExample 3.2. Density matrices on any Hilbert space of prime dimension are always inseparable. Multipartite states should live on Hilbert\nspaces of dimension equal to powers of prime numbers.\nLocal unitary equivalent classes can also be studied from representation theoretic viewpoints. Let K = SUn corresponding to the factorization n, and H = SU\u03bb \u2264 G = SU(n) as above. Both H and K are\nclosed subgroups of G. We consider the restriction ResK IndG\nH C. Let\nW be any H-module, then it follows from Frobenius reciprocity [BD]\nthat\nG\nG\nHomK (ResK IndG\nH C, W ) \u2243 HomG (IndH C, IndK W )\n\n\u2243 HomH (C, ResH IndG\nK W ).\nIn particular, when W = C, one has the duality ResK IndG\nHC \u2243\nG\nG\nResH IndG\nC.\nThe\nlinear\noperators\nin\nHom\n(Ind\nC,\nInd\nC)\nin\ngenG\nK\nH\nK\neral are certain distributions on the direct product of the unitary group\nby Schwartz's distribution theory [Sc]. If the intertwining number (the\nG\ndimension of HomG (IndG\nH C, IndK W )) is finite, then they are equal to\nthe number of double cosets of K\\G/H by Mackey's theorem [Mc].\nThus we obtain the following result.\nTheorem 3.3. Let H = H1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Hr be the global Hilbert space with\ndim(Hi ) = ni , and Un as above. Then the classes of globally equivalent\nmulti-partite mixed states under local equivalence are isomorphic to the\nU (n)\nrestriction of the induced representation IndU\u03bb C to the subgroup SUn .\n\n\f8\n\nNAIHUAN JING\n\n4. Homogeneous spaces\nHomogeneous spaces are important non-empty manifolds with a transitive action of a Lie group. The quotient space G/H are special examples of homogeneous spaces. If one views equivalent local unitary\nclasses as points in the homogeneous spaces one may understand the\ngeometric meaning of the statement that all points are the same.\nLet n be a fixed prime decomposition of n and \u03bb be a fixed partition\nof n. If two density matrices \u03c1i are locally equivalent, then their corresponding double cosets Un g1 U\u03bb and Un g1 U\u03bb are the same. Note that\nin this description the equivalence relations are determined completely\nby the double cosets, and no information about the actual eigenvalues\nare needed. In other words, classes of density matrices with the same\neigenvalue distribution can be mapped to classes of density matrices\nwith the same eigenvalue multiplicities. Therefore we have proved the\nfollowing result.\nTheorem 4.1. Let H = H1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Hr be the global Hilbert space with\ndim(Hi ) = ni , and Un as above. Then the class of globally equivalent multi-partite mixed states under local equivalence can be mapped\nto another class of globally equivalent multi-partite mixed states with\nthe same eigenvalue distribution and multiplicities. The two classes\nare both described by the homogeneous spaces Un \\U/U\u03bb , where the partition \u03bb is given by the eigenvalue multiplicities.\nThis result shows that the local unitary equivalence relations does\nnot depend on the actual values of the eigenvalues, and all classes can\nbe viewed as \"equal\" in geometric sense. Therefore we can parameterize\nthe classes of density matrices by the set\nRn \u00d7 (Un \\U(n)/U\u03bb ),\nwhere R is used for the eigenvalue.\nExample 4.2. For e \u2265 0 and 0 \u2264 f \u2264 1 \u2212 e we consider the two qubit\nWerner state\n\uf8eb 1\u2212e\u2212f\n\uf8f6\n3\n\n\uf8ec\n\u03c1=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n1+2f\n6\n1\u22124f\n6\n\n1\u22124f\n6\n1+2f\n6\n\n1+e\u2212f\n3\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f8\n\nWhen e = 0, this is the usual Werner state [W]. The eigenvalues are\n(1 \u2212 f + e)/3, (1 \u2212 f )/3, (1 \u2212 f \u2212 e)/3, f.\nThe nontrivial factorization is certainly 4 = 2 * 2 and the partition of\nthe eigenvalue multiplicities are \u03bb = (1111) for e > 0 and f 6= 1\u00b1e\n.\n4\n\n\fON CLASSES OF LOCAL UNITARY TRANSFORMATIONS\n\n9\n\nor 1/4 then \u03bb = (211). If e = 0, then\nWhen e > 0 and f = 1\u00b1e\n4\n\u03bb = (31) for f 6= 1/4 and \u03bb = (4) for f = 1/4. From the picture there\nare essentially one dense class of local unitary equivalence; two onedimensional classes of unitary equivalence; and one degenerate class\nof unitary equivalence. The most interesting cases are \u03bb = (31) and\n(212 ), where the local unitary classes are classified by double cosets of\nSU(22) \\SU(4)/(SU(3) \u00d7 SU(1)) and SU(22) \\SU(4)/(SU(2) \u00d7 SU(1) \u00d7\nSU(1)) respectively.

Conclusion\nWe have established a one-to-one correspondence between the set of\ndensity matrices of multi-partite systems and the set of double cosets of\nadditive and multiplicative Young subgroups of unitary groups. Our results show that the interrelationship among the classes of local unitary\nequivalent multi-partite mixed states is independent from the actual\nvalues of the eigenvalues and only depends on the multiplicities of the\neigenvalues. This interesting phenomenon allows us to look at the local\nunitary equivalence for all global unitary density matrices at the same\ntime. The geometry of the classes are given by that of homogeneous\nspaces of the unitary group as well as the invariant theory of classical groups (cf. [H]). It is expected that the combinatorics of density\nmatrices and invariant theory will also play a role in this study.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank S. M.
