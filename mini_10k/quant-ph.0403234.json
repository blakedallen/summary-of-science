These states may for example be used as a main\nresource for quantum cryptographic protocols (see [2, 3]\nand references therein). They may also serve as an entanglement source since combining two squeezed states at\na beamsplitter creates an entangled two-mode squeezed\nstate such as those required for quantum teleportation\n[4] or dense coding [5]. In addition, squeezing has been\nshown to be an irreducible resource for realizing an arbitrary linear canonical transformation [6].\nAny attempt to process squeezed states in quantum\ncommunication or computation systems will necessarily\nface the problem of characterizing these states. A possible complete description of a general quantum state\nis obtained by reconstructing its Wigner function using\nquantum tomographic procedures [7, 8, 9]. Alternatively,\nfor a Gaussian state, which is fully described by its first\nand second order moments, another complete characterization is provided by the mean values of the conjugate\nquadratures x and p together with the associated covariance matrix \u03b3. From this, one may compute various relevant parameters such as the maximum observable squeezing [10] or the degree of purity [11, 12].\nIn this paper, we follow an idea originally due to two of\nthe present authors that consists of measuring the squeezing and purity of a Gaussian state without homodyne detection, that is, without any strong local oscillator beam\nproviding a phase reference [13]. The suggested setup\nonly relies on beamsplitters and single-photon detectors.\nIt generally requires a joint measurement of two copies\nof the Gaussian state, but single-copy measurements suffice if it is a priori known that the mean values of the\nquadratures vanish. Thus, in the latter case, which actually applies to all quantum information schemes based\non squeezed vacuum states, no interferometric stability\nis required to determine the squeezing and purity, unlike\nwith homodyne detection schemes.\nHereafter, we will focus on the important case of\n\na single-mode squeezed vacuum state and discuss the\nexperimental feasibility and relevance of this photoncounting characterization procedure. Some useful notations to describe a squeezed vacuum beam are introduced in section II. Section III then presents the experimental setup together with two classical and homodyne\nmeasurement procedures that are used as a reference to\ncharacterize the generated squeezed vacuum states. In\nSection IV, we briefly review the photon-counting characterization method applied to the special case of a singlemode Gaussian state (more details can be found in [13]).\nIn Section V, we present the experimental results of this\ncharacterization method, while Section VI discusses the\nconstraints on the global detection efficiency that are put\nby this method. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the photon-counting method for values of the global\ndetection efficiency that are presently unreachable in the\nexperiments.\nII.\n\nSQUEEZED VACUUM DESCRIPTION\n\nTheoretically, a general Gaussian state with zero mean\nvalues of quadratures is fully characterized by its covariance matrix \u03b3, which comprises the second moments of\nthe conjugate quadratures x = a + a\u2020 and p = (a \u2212 a\u2020 )/i,\nwith [x, p] = 2i. For states with zero mean values of\nquadratures, the covariance matrix \u03b3 can be expressed\nas follows,\n!\n1\nhx2 i\n2 hxp + pxi\n\u03b3= 1\n.\n(1)\nhp2 i\n2 hxp + pxi\nIn order to determine the squeezing and purity, we only\nneed to measure the two invariants of the covariance matrix, namely the trace Tr(\u03b3) and determinant det(\u03b3).\nFrom a more physical point of view, one can use the\nfact that the most general single-mode Gaussian state\nwith hxi = hpi = 0 can be expressed as a squeezing\noperator applied to a Gaussian thermal state [12, 15].\nTranslated into an optical setup, this is implemented by\ntwo simple linear amplifiers as depicted in Fig. 1 : a\nphase-insensitive amplifier of gain H followed by a phasesensitive amplifier of gains G and 1/G (in the following\n\n\f2\n\nOPA\n\n|0\u3009\n\nH\n\nG\n1/G\n\nSqueezed state generation\nPulsed\nLaser\n\nSqueezed\nbeam\n\nSHG\n\nOPA\n\nSqueezed beam\nRemovable mirror\n\nFIG. 1: General single-mode Gaussian state generation. H\ndenotes the intensity gain of the phase-independent amplifier\nand G stands for the intensity gain of the phase-dependent\namplifier.\n\nwe take G, H > 1). In other words, the physics of the\noptical parametric amplifier (OPA) can be modeled by a\n\"black box\" squeezer which is parametrized by H and G.\nThese two parameters are equivalent to the two phaseinsensitive parameters Tr(\u03b3) and det(\u03b3) of the Gaussian\nstate generated by the black box from the vacuum.\nLet us describe the transformation effected by the amplifier depicted in Fig. 1. First, one can express the conjugate quadrature variables at the output of the OPA\nas\n\u221a\n1 \u221a\nxout = \u221a ( Hxvac + H \u2212 1xanc ),\n(2)\nG\n\u221a \u221a\n\u221a\npout = G( Hpvac \u2212 H \u2212 1panc ),\n(3)\nwhere we chose xout (pout ) as the squeezed (antisqueezed) quadrature, and xvac and xanc denote the vacuum and ancilla quadratures at the input ports of the\ntotal amplifier, respectively. One can then express the\nvariances of the squeezed and anti-squeezed quadratures\nat the output of the OPA as\nVmin = (2H \u2212 1)/G,\nVmax = (2H \u2212 1) G.\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nThe trace and determinant of the covariance matrix read\nTr(\u03b3) = Vmin + Vmax ,\ndet(\u03b3) = Vmin Vmax .\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nThis system of equations can be inverted, and the\nsqueezed and anti-squeezed variances can be expressed\nin terms of the trace and the determinant of \u03b3,\n\u0015\n\u0014\nq\n1\n2\nTr(\u03b3) \u00b1 Tr (\u03b3) \u2212 4 det(\u03b3) .

REFERENCE CLASSICAL AND\nHOMODYNE CHARACTERIZATION METHODS\n\nA new scheme for pulsed squeezed light generation has\nrecently been developed [14] and will be used here to\ncompare the photon-counting characterization method to\nstandard methods. The experimental setup is depicted in\nFig. 2. The initial pulses are obtained from a titaniumsapphire laser delivering nearly Fourier-transform limited\npulses centered on 846 nm, with a duration of 150 fs, a\ntypical energy of 40 nJ, and a repetition rate of 780.4\nkHz. These pulses are frequency doubled in a single pass\nthrough a thin (100 \u03bcm) crystal of potassium niobate\n(KNbO3 ), cut and temperature-tuned for non-critical\ntype-I phase-matching. The second harmonic power is\nlarge enough to obtain a significant single-pass parametric gain in a similar KNbO3 crystal used in a type-I spatially degenerate configuration.\nThe squeezed beam can then be directed onto two different detection modules using a removable mirror:\n(i) Homodyne detection module : the squeezed vacuum\nbeam interferes with the local oscillator beam (LO) in a\nbalanced homodyne detection setup. A main feature of\nour experiment is that all the processing is done in the\ntime domain, not in the frequency domain. For each\nincoming pulse, the fast acquisition board samples one\nvalue of the signal quadrature in phase with the local\noscillator [14].\n(ii) Photon counting module : the squeezed vacuum\nbeam is transmitted via a beam splitter of tunable transmittance T and then passes through a spatial filter (made\nof two Fourier-conjugated pinholes) and a 3 nm spectral\nfilter centered at the laser wavelength, before being detected by a silicon avalanche photodiode (APD).\nTo start the characterization procedure, a basic measurement is to monitor the classical amplification and\nde-amplification of a probe taken from the fundamental beam. This is easily done by direct detection of a\nprobe beam averaged power on a photodiode. Setting\nthe relative phase between the probe and the second harmonic pump beam allows to tune the classical gain from\n\n\f3\n\nThe experimental results of the squeezed vacuum characterization for different values of the pump power are\nshown in Figs. 3 and 4, marked as \"Classical\" (black\ndisks).\nFollowing the principle of quantum tomography, a\npowerful approach is to completely characterize the\nsqueezed vacuum by conjugate quadratures homodyne\nmeasurements. The time-resolved balanced homodyne\ndetection allows to measure the squeezed and antisqueezed quadrature variances Vhom,min and Vhom,max .\nImperfections and losses in this detection are modeled\nby a beamsplitter of transmission \u03b7hom (in intensity).\nThe procedure to measure the detection efficiency is well\nestablished from squeezing experiments [16], and it can\nbe cross-checked by comparing the classical parametric\ngain and the measured degree of squeezing. We note\n2\nthe homodyne detection efficiency \u03b7hom = \u03b7T \u03b7H\n\u03b7D =\n0.76 \u00b1 0.01, where the overall transmission \u03b7T = 0.92,\nthe mode-matching visibility \u03b7H = 0.935, and the detectors efficiency \u03b7D = 0.945 are independently measured.\nGiven this efficiency, one can correct for losses and deduce\nthe squeezed and anti-squeezed quadrature variances at\nthe output port of the OPA, namely\nVmin = (Vhom,min \u2212 1 + \u03b7hom )/\u03b7hom ,\nVmax = (Vhom,max \u2212 1 + \u03b7hom )/\u03b7hom .\n\nG\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nH\n\nthe minimum de-amplification intensity gain Gmin to the\nmaximum gain Gmax . The measurement of the classical\ngains Gmin and Gmax gives an estimate of G and H,\np\nGmax /Gmin ,\n(11)\nG =\np\nH =\nGmax Gmin .\n(12)\n\n(c)\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nThis allows the full characterization of the state parameters (Tr(\u03b3), det(\u03b3)) or the OPA parameters (G, H) following the above formulae. The experimental results of\nthis second characterization method are also displayed\nin Figs. 3 and 4, marked as \"Homodyne\" (gray squares).\nAs one can notice in Figs. 3 and 4, for high pump powers the \"homodyne\" and \"classical\" values do not well\noverlap within their respective error bars. A main reason for this is that the \"black-box\" model developed\nabove is basically a single-mode model, and thus suffers\nfrom fundamental limitations, while for high pump powers the physics involved in parametric de-amplification\nare known to fall into a multi-mode regime [17].\nIn the following, we will use these \"classical\" and \"homodyne\" methods as references to check the validity of\nthe photon-counting characterization.\n\nFIG. 3: Parametric gains G, H and purity P versus average\npump power at 423nm. The solid line corresponds to a fit on\nthe classical results according to plane wave theory. \"Classical\" stands for the classical probe gain measurements (black\ndisks), \"Homodyne\" stands for the balanced homodyne detection variance measurements (gray squares). The bounds\ninferred from the photon counting method, to be described in\nsection IV, are indicated by the two dashed lines (see further\nexplanations in section V).\n\nIV. PHOTON-COUNTING\nCHARACTERIZATION METHOD\n\nLet us briefly introduce the methods implemented here\nfor measuring the properties of a Gaussian state by photon counting, which are derived from the original procedure presented in [13]. We will restrict our attention to a\n\nsingle-mode Gaussian state with zero coherent displacement, hxi = hpi = 0, which is the case in the present\nexperiment depicted in Fig. 2.

One possibility to gain information from more\nthan two measurements is to implement a maximumlikelihood (ML) parameter estimation method (for a review, see for instance Refs. [18, 19, 20]). This procedure\nprovides the values of the parameters Tr(\u03b3) and det(\u03b3)\nthat are the most likely to yield the observed experimental data.

Non-unit transmissions of the spectral and spatial filters and imperfect detection efficiency are taken into account by an overall\nefficiency parameter \u03b7APD of the APD detection.\nA first step is to estimate this overall efficiency \u03b7APD\nin order to apply the characterization method. Setting\nthe supplementary beamsplitter to a transmittance of 1,\n\u03b7APD can be estimated from the measurement of the\nnumber of photon-counting events detected per second\nNclicks for different pump powers. In the limit of low\n\u03b7APD 's, the number of clicks detected per second can be\napproximated as\nNclicks =\n\n1\n\u03b7APD Nrep [(H \u2212 1/2)(G + 1/G) \u2212 1], (22)\n2\n\nwhere the dependence of G and H versus the pump power\nis obtained from the curve fit on the \"classical\" results\npresented Figs. 3(a) and (b), while Nrep = 780.4kHz is\nthe repetition rate. With our experimental results (see\n\nFig. 5) and a repetition rate of 780.4 kHz, the fit of Nclicks\nversus the pump power gives \u03b7APD = 0.84\u00d710\u22122\u00b10.013\u00d7\n10\u22122 . This value can be cross-checked with the overall\nefficiency inferred from transmission factors of an intense\nprobe beam : the spatial and spectral filters transmit\nrespectively 16% and 17% of the probe beam, while the\nAPD quantum efficiency is estimated to about 50%, leading to an overall detection efficiency of the probe of about\n1.4%. The difference between the latter value and the\nabove estimate of \u03b7APD may be explained by slight differences between the modes of the probe (set for maximal\nclassical de-amplification) and the squeezed vacuum.\nIn our experiment, we used between 4 and 6 different\nsettings for the beamsplitter transmittance Tj . For each\nTj , we performed 100 measurements of the number of\nclicks per second to get a good statistical accuracy on Cj .\nAs a result of an appropriate gating of the detection, the\ndark count rate remained reasonably low (about 20s\u22121 )\nand was subtracted from the data.\nAs shown above, only two different settings of the\nbeamsplitter transmittance, T1 and T2 , are enough to\nextract the value of det(\u03b3) and Tr(\u03b3) following Eqs. (18)\nand (19). Actually, formula (18) indeed leads to an estimate of Tr(\u03b3) which is satisfactorily close to the values obtained from either homodyne or classical measurement. However, as far as the determination of det(\u03b3) is\nconcerned, the formula (19) does not give any reliable\nestimate. This results from the fact that, in the experiment, we have to work with small detection efficiencies\n\u03b7APD \u226a 1 so that small uncertainties on P1 , P2 , T1 , T2\nhave much larger influence on det(\u03b3) than on Tr(\u03b3). For\ninstance, if we take the derivative of Tr(\u03b3) and det(\u03b3)\nwith respect to P1 , we find,\n4\nd Tr(\u03b3)\n=\n,\ndP1\n\u03b7APD P13\nd det(\u03b3)\n\u221216\n= 2\n.\ndP1\n\u03b7APD P13\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\nThis shows that in our experimental setup, the determinant is about 400 times more sensitive to small uncertainties on P1 than the trace.\nIn order to gain information on the determinant of the\ncovariance matrix as well as to increase the accuracy of\nthe estimate of its trace, we used the full set of measurements for the different beamsplitter transmittances\nby performing a maximum-likelihood estimation as introduced in the previous section. The logarithm of the likelihood function L given by Eq.(20) was computed from the\nmeasured data, the above estimate of the overall detection efficiency \u03b7APD , and the values of the transmittance\nTj obtained from direct power transmission of the probe\nbeam. The global maximum of log(L) was then found by\nbrute force numerical search. The experimental results of\nthe estimated Tr(\u03b3) for several different pump powers are\nshown in Fig. 4(a), and fully coincide with the values inferred from the classical gain measurements. Out of the\nthree trace-estimation procedures, the photon-counting\n\n\f6\nmethod associated with log-likelihood maximization provides the lowest uncertainty on the result.\nUnfortunately, given the low detection efficiency \u03b7APD\nof our experimental setup, the likelihood function is almost flat as a function of det(\u03b3) in the region that is\nallowed by the constraints (21). Consequently, no reliable estimate of the determinant could be obtained from\nour experimental data, the log-likelihood maximization\nmethod returning essentially a random value between 1\nand (Tr(\u03b3)/2)2 . Similarly, our experimental data only\nprovides bounds on the parametric gains G and H given\nthe sole knowledge of the trace Tr(\u03b3) :\n#1/2\np\nTr(\u03b3)2 \u2212 4\np\n,\nTr(\u03b3) \u2212 Tr(\u03b3)2 \u2212 4\n\n1 \u2264G\u2264\n\n\"\n\n1 \u2264H\u2264\n\nTr(\u03b3) + 2\n.\n4\n\nTr(\u03b3) +\n\n(25)\nVI.\n\nNUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\n\n(26)\n\nThus, the dashed lines in Figs. 3(a), (b), (c), and 4(b)\ntake into account the fact that no estimate of the determinant better than the bounds (21) could be obtained\nby the photon-counting method given the estimate of the\ntrace. We also tried various other numerical methods such as least squares inversion - but neither provided a\nreliable estimate of det(\u03b3).\nSome better insight on the intrinsic difficulty to get an\nestimate of det(\u03b3) can be obtained by rewriting Eq. (17)\nas\n4\n2\n= (det(\u03b3) \u2212 Tr(\u03b3) + 1) \u03b7APD\nTj2\nPj2\n+ 2 (Tr(\u03b3) \u2212 2) \u03b7APD Tj + 4.\n\ndetermine the minimal number of modes N that is necessary for the description of the observed signal. However,\na successful application of this technique would require a\nvery high precision in the measurement of P and a high\n\u03b7APD .\nA second problem with removing the spatial and/or\nspectral filters is that we would loose any possibility to\ncross-check our results with classical parametric gain or\nhomodyne measurements. Last, even in the case of no\nspatial filter and 10 nm spectral filter, the overall APD\ndetection efficiency will remain low given our experimental setup, and we do not expect to gain much according\nto our numerical simulations of the constraints on the\nglobal efficiency presented below.\n\n(27)\n\nIt becomes clear that the determinant is linked to the\nsecond-order dependence of Pj\u22122 in the transmittance,\nwhile the trace can be directly obtained from the linear dependence of Pj\u22122 . The basic difficulty to estimate\ndet(\u03b3) results from the fact that the relevant information is hidden in terms of order (\u03b7APD T )2 , which are very\nsmall for our experimental data given the low values of\n\u03b7APD .\nOne could then try to increase the overall APD detection efficiency \u03b7APD by releasing either the spatial or\nspectral filtering conditions. However, from an experimental point of view, this does not seem realistic for\nseveral reasons.\nFirst, we would move to a region where the physics become multimode, which is clearly outside the framework\nof the developed model. In principle, the photon counting method allows one to check whether the single-mode\ndescription of the experiment is appropriate or not. If\nonly a single mode is detected, then P \u22122 should be a\nquadratic polynomial in \u03b7APD T , cfr. Eq. (27). More\ngenerally, if the detector effectively registers light from\nN modes in a Gaussian state, then P \u22122 becomes a polynomial of 2N -th order in \u03b7APD T [13]. So, after measuring\nP as a function of \u03b7APD T one could perform a fitting to\n\nWe have seen that the low APD detection efficiency\n\u03b7APD precludes a reliable estimate of det(\u03b3) via the\nphoton-counting method. It is thus important to determine the efficiency \u03b7APD that should be attained in order\nto be able to estimate det(\u03b3) with acceptably small errors. More generally, it is interesting to investigate the\ndependence of the estimation errors on \u03b7APD . For this\npurpose, we have carried out extensive numerical simulations of the experiment for several values of \u03b7APD ,\nthe other parameters of the simulation being chosen in\naccordance with the experimental values. In particular, we have assumed a measurement repetition rate\nNrep = 780.4 kHz and a total measurement time t = 100 s\nfor each transmittance Tj . The total number of measurements for each Tj is then given by Ntot = Nrep t. We\nhave further assumed that measurements were carried\nout for four different transmittances T1 = 1, T2 = 0.75,\nT3 = 0.5 and T4 = 0.25, and we used the experimentally\nobtained values det(\u03b3) = 1.156 and Tr(\u03b3) = 2.321 as a\ntypical example (corresponding to a pump average power\nof 1.21mW).\nThe determinant and the trace of \u03b3 were estimated\nfrom the simulated experimental data with the help of\nthe maximum-likelihood technique described in the preceding section. Since the ML estimator is generally biased, we define the deviation of the estimate from the\ntrue value as\n2\n\u03c3det\n= h(det(\u03b3)est \u2212 det(\u03b3)true )2 i,\n2\n\u03c3Tr = h(Tr(\u03b3)est \u2212 Tr(\u03b3)true )2 i,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere hi indicates averaging over an ensemble of experiments. In practice, we simulated 1000 times the whole\nexperiment, from data acquisition to the ML estimation,\nand we then calculated (28) by averaging over the ensemble. Since the total number of measurements Ntot\nwas very large, we approximated the binomial distribution of Cj by a normal distribution with the same mean\nand variance.\nBesides the statistical fluctuations of Cj and the intrinsic difficulty of estimating det(\u03b3) at low detection effi-\n\n\f7\n1.5\n-1\n\n10\n0.1\n\nDet(\u03b3)\n\n1.4\n-2\n\n\u03c3det\n\n0.01\n10\n\n1.3\n1.2\n\n-3\n\n10\n0.001\n\n1.1\n-4\n\n10\n0.0001\n\n1.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b7APD\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nFIG. 6: The dependence of the variance \u03c3det of the estimation\nof det(\u03b3) on the detector efficiency \u03b7APD in case when the\nparameters Tj and \u03b7APD are known exactly (circles) and when\nthe experimental uncertainties of Tj is 0.5% and the relative\nuncertainty of \u03b7APD is 1% (squares).

This figure has been scaled so as to\nbe easily compared to the experimental results presented on\nFig.4(b).\n\nVII.\n\nciencies, other factors contribute to the estimation errors,\nnamely the uncertainty in the knowledge of Tj and \u03b7APD .\nTo isolate the errors stemming from low \u03b7APD , we have\nfirst assumed that all parameters Tj and \u03b7APD are known\nprecisely, hence the statistical fluctuations of Cj are the\nonly source of errors. The resulting \u03c3det is plotted as circles in Fig. 6. For very low \u03b7APD , the estimates of det(\u03b3)\nare randomly distributed in the interval [1, (Tr(\u03b3))2 /4]\nand \u03c3det \u2248 21 (Tr2 (\u03b3)/4\u22121). The estimation error rapidly\ndecreases as \u03b7APD grows, and our numerical simulations\nreveal that a reliable estimate of det(\u03b3) with \u03c3det < 10\u22122\ncould be obtained for \u03b7APD > 15%.\nThe uncertainties of Tj and \u03b7APD significantly increase\nthe estimation error for higher \u03b7APD . We have performed\nnumerical simulations taking into account that Tj 's are\nknown with an uncertainty of 0.5%, and the relative uncertainty of \u03b7APD is 1% which corresponds to the actual\nexperimental situation. The resulting \u03c3det is plotted as\nsquares in Fig. 6. We observe that \u03c3det is much higher\nthan in the previous case, except for the region of very\nsmall \u03b7APD . To obtain a satisfactorily accurate estimate\nof det(\u03b3) with \u03c3 \u2248 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 , we need \u03b7APD & 50%.\nIn order to demonstrate that \u03b7APD = 50% is indeed\nsufficient for the whole range of values of the pump power,\nwe have simulated the results of an experiment at \u03b7APD =\n50% for the same values of the pump power as in Figs. 3\nand 4. The results are given in Fig. 7 which shows the\nmean estimated values of det(\u03b3) as well as the resulting\nerror bars. We find that these estimates are in very good\nagreement with the true values used in the simulation.\nFinally, note that our numerical simulations also confirm that the estimate of Tr(\u03b3) is very accurate: we have\nfound that \u03c3Tr \u2264 10\u22122 even for \u03b7APD as low as 1%.\n\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\nPump average power (mW)\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have shown that direct photoncounting detection can be used, instead of homodyning, to evaluate the squeezing and purity of an arbitrary\nsingle-mode gaussian state. For the rather generic states\nthat we considered, the trace of the covariance matrix can\nbe accurately determined, even with an overall detection\nefficiency \u03b7 in the percent range, while its determinant\n(related to the state purity) requires a much higher \u03b7,\ntypically around 50%.\nIn principle, such efficiencies are well within the reach\nof silicon photon-counting avalanche photodiodes, but an\nimportant problem remains : most sources do not emit\nsingle-mode gaussian light, but rather multimode light.\nThis is not a problem when a homodyne detection is used,\nbecause the local oscillator acts as a very efficient singlemode filter. On the other hand, a photon counter detects photons in any mode. Therefore, detecting a good\napproximation of a single mode state requires appropriate spatial and spectral filters, respectively obtained from\npinholes and diffraction gratings. Unless a special effort\nis made, these filters will have a low overall transmission\n(a few percent in our experiment), and thus the direct\ndetection method will fail to determine the state purity.\nIn principle, there are various ways for improvement,\nwhich are open for further experimental work. Ideally,\nthe source itself should emit single mode light, which\nmight be obtained by appropriate phase-matching conditions in a \u03c7(2) non-linear crystal. On the filtering side, interferometric multidielectric filters provide transmission\nvalues which are much higher than standard slits and\ngrating set-ups. A combination of these various techniques will be probably needed to reach the high overall\nefficiencies needed for many potential applications.\nAs a conclusion, it appears that a broad variety of\ntechniques is available to characterize quantum continuous variables, and that these methods will certainly\n\n\f8\ncontinue to develop for applications in quantum cryptography, quantum communications, and possibly quantum computing. Perhaps the most appealing application\nof the photon-counting method is the direct determination of the entanglement of two-mode Gaussian states by\nmeasuring only the purity of the two-mode state and the\nmarginal purities of the single-mode states on each side\n[13, 21]. All these purities can be determined with the\nphoton counting method using only local measurements.\nThe distinct feature of this approach is that no interferometric stability is required if one is dealing with squeezed\nvacuum states, which is the case in many experiments.\nThis may be an important advantage in the characterization of entanglement distribution over long-distance\n\ncontinuous-variable quantum communication networks.\n\n[1] S.L.
