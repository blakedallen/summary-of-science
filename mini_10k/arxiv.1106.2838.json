Introduction\nAbout sixty years ago, Newton and Wigner showed that there is no position operator\nfor a massless particle with spin higher than 1/2 [1]. This fact lead many authors to\nconclude that it is not possible to define a wave function for a photon, which has zero\nmass and spin (or helicity) 1. However, Bialynicki-Birula [2, 3] and, independently, Sipe\n[4], introduced a function of the position and time coordinates that completely describes\nthe quantum state of a photon. In their opinion, which is shared by us, such function\nmay be referred to as the photon wave function. The wave equation for this function\ncan be derived from the Einstein kinematics for a particle with spin 1 and zero mass\nin the same way that the Dirac equation is obtained for a massive particle with spin\n1/2 [5, 6]. A strong argument in favor of this photon wave function formulation is that\nthe corresponding wave equation is completely equivalent to the Maxwell equations in\nvacuum.\nIn the present work we extend the Bialynicki-Birula\u2013Sipe formalism to include\nthe interaction of photons with non-absorptive continuous media. In section 2 we\nbriefly discuss the photon wave equation in vacuum and some properties of photon\nwave functions. In section 3 the photon wave equation is modified including a term\nassociated with the induced current density in the medium, that makes it equivalent to\nthe macroscopic Maxwell equations for electromagnetic waves in the presence of matter.\nIn section 4 we apply the second quantization procedure to the photon wave function\nformalism in a linear non-dispersive and non-absorptive medium, allowing for description\nof quantum phenomena. In section 5 we present a method for treating the scattering of\nphotons by material media. As an example of application of the proposed formalism,\nin section 6 the state of the photon pairs generated by parametric down conversion is\nobtained with an intuitive derivation. In section 7 we present our concluding remarks\nand summarize our results.\n2. Photon wave equation in vacuum\nThe Bialynicki-Birula\u2013Sipe wave equation for a photon described by the wave function\n\u03a8(r, t) is [2, 3, 4]\n\u2202\u03a8\n= h\u0304c\u03c3\u0302\u2207 \u00d7 \u03a8,\n(1)\n\u2202t\nwhere h\u0304 is the Planck's constant divided by 2\u03c0 and \u03c3\u0302 is an operator that acts on the\nphoton helicity. A spin one can be represented by a vector in the 3-dimensional complex\nspace, so the vectorial character of \u03a8 incorporates its internal degrees of freedom. The\nphoton wave function can be decomposed in the eigenvectors of the helicity operator \u03c3\u0302\nand also in its real and imaginary parts:\nih\u0304\n\n\u03a8 = \u03a8+ + \u03a8\u2212 , with \u03a8\u00b1 =\n\nr\n\ns\n\n\u03b50\n1\nE\u00b1 \u00b1 i\nB\u00b1 and \u03c3\u0302\u03a8\u00b1 = \u00b1\u03a8\u00b1 . (2)\n2\n2\u03bc0\n\n\fInteraction between light and matter: A photon wave function approach\n\n3\n\nIf we associate the real vectors E \u2261 E+ + E\u2212 and B \u2261 B+ + B\u2212 with the electric and\nmagnetic fields of the photon and \u03b50 and \u03bc0 with the permittivity and the permeability of\nfree space, (1) together with the divergence-free condition of the photon wave function\n\u2207 * \u03a8 = 0 (which is essential to arrive at the photon wave equation from Einstein\nkinematics [5, 6]) are completely equivalent to the set of the four Maxwell equations\nin vacuum. The eigenvalues of the helicity operator correspond to photons with left\nand right circular polarizations. An arbitrary polarization state can be written as a\nparticular combination of these two.\nThere is a peculiarity in the form (2) for the photon wave function: Its modulus\nsquared has the unit of energy density, not of probability density, and agrees with the\nclassical electromagnetic energy density. This fact is associated with the problem of\nnon-localization of the photon [1], and it happens that the energy density is the local\nuseful concept, since photons have no other scalar quantities such as mass or charge, but\nonly energy [4]. The normalization condition is that the integral of |\u03a8|2 is equal to the\nexpectation value of the photon energy. There is no direct association of the modulus\nsquared of the wave function with the probability density of detecting the photon in the\nregion, unless we consider dimensions larger than the photon wavelength [7]. But neither\nthe localization of massive relativistic particles is a clear concept. In this sense, photons\nare not significantly different from massive particles, as both can have an exponential\nfalloff of their wave functions with distance in relativistic treatments [8], the difference\nbeing that photons are always relativistic.\n3. Photon wave equation in material media\nOur proposal to treat the interaction of photons with continuous media is to include a\nterm proportional to the current density J induced in the media due to the presence of\nthe photon in (1):\nJ\n\u2202\u03a8\n.\n(3)\n= h\u0304c\u03c3\u0302\u2207 \u00d7 \u03a8 \u2212 ih\u0304 \u221a\nih\u0304\n\u2202t\n2\u03b50\nThis approach is similar to the one adopted by Keller [9]. However, Keller was interested\nin calculating the wave function of a photon emitted from an atom and the current\ndensity was a source term. Here we are considering continuous media and the current\ndensity J represents a response of the medium due to the presence of the photon, not\nbeing an independent source of photons. So the objective of the present work is very\ndifferent from Keller's, although the initial step is similar. When considering continuous\nmedia, we are implicitly assuming that the photon wavelength is much larger than the\ndistances between the atoms that compose the medium, in such a way that the collective\nmotion of the charges may be approximated by a continuous current density. We can\nwrite\nJ \u2261 Jf + \u2207 \u00d7 M + \u2202P/\u2202t,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere M and P are the magnetization and electric polarization of the medium and Jf\nis the free current density, all of them being functions of the electric and magnetic fields\n\n\fInteraction between light and matter: A photon wave function approach\n\n4\n\nof the photon. For instance, in a non-dispersive dielectric medium the polarization can\nbe written as\nPi (r, t) =\n\nX\nj\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c7ij Ej (r, t) +\n\nX\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c7ijk Ej (r, t)Ek (r, t) + ...,\n\n(5)\n\nj,k\n\nexpanded in linear and non-linear responses to the photon field. Since the non-linear\nresponse terms represent situations in which there are more than one photon involved,\na procedure of second quantization of the photon wave function is necessary to correctly\ndescribe them. This issue will become clear in section 6 where we treat the parametric\ndown-conversion, which arises from the second-order non-linear response of the medium.\nSo, if we want to deal with the wave function of a single photon, we must disregard the\nnon-linear response of the medium. In section 6 we will be interested in the interaction\nof photons with non-linear media after applying the second quantization procedure to\nthe photon wave function, so we will continue referring to the current density J in this\nsection without specification of its linear or non-linear behaviors.\nUsing the photon wave function from (2), we can see that (3) is equivalent to\nthe Maxwell equations by writing its real and imaginary parts. Its real part with the\napplication of the operator \u03c3\u0302 and its imaginary part give:\n\u2202B\n,\n(6)\n\u2207\u00d7E=\u2212\n\u2202t\nB\n\u2202E\n\u2202D\n\u2207\u00d7\n= \u03b50\n+ J , or \u2207 \u00d7 H = Jf +\n,\n(7)\n\u03bc0\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\nwith E \u2261 E+ + E\u2212 , B \u2261 B+ + B\u2212 , H \u2261 B/\u03bc0 \u2212 M and D \u2261 \u03b50 E + P. Taking the\ndivergence of the above equations we obtain\n\u2202\n(\u2207 * B) = 0 .\n(8)\n\u2202t\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(\u2207 * D) = \u2212\u2207 * Jf , or (\u2207 * D \u2212 \u03c1f ) = 0 ,\n(9)\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\nwhere \u03c1f is the free charge density and we have \u2207 * Jf = \u2212\u2202\u03c1f /\u2202t. What the above\nequations tell us is that if \u2207 * B = 0 and \u2207 * D = \u03c1f at any particular instant of time,\nwhich is true before the photon interacts with the media, these relations must be always\nsatisfied. With this argument we complete the proof that (3) is equivalent to the set\nof Maxwell equations for electromagnetic waves. So our treatment predicts that the\nbehavior of photons in linear non-absorptive media, where a one-photon theory may be\nused, is completely analogous to the behavior of classical electromagnetic pulses. This\nstatement is supported by experiments [10] and is difficult to obtain with the formalism\nof second quantization [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. So we believe that in the same way that\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is used to treat the behavior of massive particles under the\naction of a classical potential, the formalism of this section may be used to describe\nthe interaction of photons with material media when there is no absorption or emission\nof photons. In cases where there is absorption or emission of photons we must apply\nthe second quantization procedure on the photon wave function, to be done in the next\nsection.\n\n\fInteraction between light and matter: A photon wave function approach\n\n5\n\nFrom (3) we can derive a continuity equation for the photon wave function. Taking\nthe scalar product with \u03a8\u2217 on both sides of (3) and summing the complex conjugate,\nafter verifying that (\u03c3\u0302\u2207 \u00d7 \u03a8)\u2217 * \u03a8 = (\u2207 \u00d7 \u03a8\u2217 ) * (\u03c3\u0302\u03a8) and using the vectorial identity\n\u2207 * (A \u00d7 B) = B * (\u2207 \u00d7 A) \u2212 A * (\u2207 \u00d7 B), we arrive at\n1\n\u2202\n|\u03a8|2 = \u2212\u2207 * S \u2212 \u221a (\u03a8 + \u03a8\u2217 ) * J,\n\u2202t\n2\u03b50\n\n(10)\n\nwhere S \u2261 \u2212ic \u03a8\u2217 \u00d7 (\u03c3\u0302\u03a8) is the current density of the photon wave function. Using\n(2) and taking the time average of S over one period of oscillation of the photon field,\nwe have hSi = hE \u00d7 Bi/\u03bc0 , analogous to the electromagnetic energy flux. The term\n\u221a\n(\u03a8 + \u03a8\u2217 ) * J/ 2\u03b50 = E * J represents the density of work done on the charges of the\nmedium per unit time. The continuity equation for the photon wave function is an\nenergy continuity equation. In our formalism, we are assuming that the photon energy\ndensity has always the same form when written in terms of the photon electric and\nmagnetic fields, independently of the medium, and that the material energy density is\ncalculated by the work done on the charges of the medium, without distinction whether\nthe work is done on bound or free currents. This approach differs from the one adopted\nby Bialynicki-Birula to treat photons in material media [3], where the photon wave\n\u221a\n\u221a\nfunction is written as F = D/ 2\u03b5 \u00b1 iB/ 2\u03bc and there is no current term in the photon\nwave equation, since the bound currents are included in the photon wave function via\nD, \u03c7e and \u03c7m . The photon energy density |F|2 is a function of the electric permittivity\n\u03b5 and magnetic permeability \u03bc of the medium since we have D = \u03b5E and H = B/\u03bc in\na linear isotropic medium.\nWhen a photon enters a medium, part of its energy is transferred to the medium.\nThe same occurs with its momentum. The discussion of the correct form for the\nmomentum and energy densities of classical electromagnetic waves in a medium has\nbeen the subject of a long debate [16]. The eventual conclusion is that there are\nmany compatible ways of defining the electromagnetic and material parts of the energy\nand momentum densities of electromagnetic waves in material media. Here we are\nassuming a particular division in the quantum domain, where the electromagnetic parts\nare |\u03a8|2 = \u03b50 |E|2/2 + |B|2 /(2\u03bc0 ) for the energy density, S for the energy flux and S/c2\nfor the momentum density. This division has been successfully tested with reasonable\nmodels in the classical domain [17, 18].\nOur formulation gives the same results as Bialynicki-Birula's for linear media:\nphotons obey the Maxwell equations, the difference being that we implicitly divided\nthe total energy and momentum of the photon in the medium in their electromagnetic\nand material parts, associating only the electromagnetic part with the photon wave\nfunction. As a consequence, our formulation can be readily extended to non-linear media\nafter the procedure of second quantization of the photon wave function, representing an\nadvantage to treat more general cases, as we discuss in the next sections.\n\n\fInteraction between light and matter: A photon wave function approach\n\n6\n\n4. Second quantization of the photon wave function in a linear\nnon-dispersive and non-absorptive medium\nThe second quantization procedure can be applied to the one-photon theory to build a\nquantum field theory for describing states with an arbitrary number of photons. This\nprocedure is described in [6]. Here we will make a similar second quantization procedure\nin an infinite linear non-dispersive and non-absorptive medium. In such a medium, the\nmaterial acquires an energy density umat = \u03c7e \u03b50 |E|2 /4+\u03c7m |B|2/[4(1+\u03c7m )\u03bc0 ] due to the\npresence of the photon [18], \u03c7e and \u03c7m being the electric and magnetic susceptibilities of\nthe medium, apart from the electromagnetic energy density |\u03a8|2 = \u03b50 |E|2 /2+|B|2/(2\u03bc0 ).\nSo the total energy density of the photon in such a medium can be written as |\u03a8\u2032 |2 ,\nwhere \u03a8\u2032 = \u03a8\u2032 + + \u03a8\u2032 \u2212 is the \"dressed photon\" wave function, with\n\u2032\u00b1\n\n\u03a8\n\n=\n\nr\n\ns\n\n\u03b5\n1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nE\u00b1 \u00b1 i\nB\u00b1 and \u03c3\u0302\u03a8\u2032 = \u00b1\u03a8\u2032 ,\n2\n2\u03bc\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03b5 \u2261 (1 + \u03c7e )\u03b50 and \u03bc \u2261 (1 + \u03c7m )\u03bc0 . It is straightforward to show that\n|\u03a8\u2032 |2 = |\u03a8|2 + umat . This form for \u03a8\u2032 is equivalent to the one used by BialynickiBirula in the case of non-dispersive linear media [3]. However, if dispersion is included\nthe modulus squared of the Bialynicki-Birula's form for the photon wave function in the\nmedium does not give the total energy density anymore, while the division of the total\nenergy density in electromagnetic and material parts remains valid [18]. Although we\nwill not treat dispersive media here, it is important to stress this fundamental difference\nbetween the treatments. The above relations can be inverted, giving\n1\n\u2217\nE \u2261 E+ + E\u2212 = \u221a (\u03a8\u2032 + \u03a8\u2032 ) ,\n(12)\n2\u03b5\nr\n\u03bc\n[(\u03c3\u0302\u03a8\u2032 ) \u2212 (\u03c3\u0302\u03a8\u2032 )\u2217 ] .\n(13)\nB \u2261 B+ + B\u2212 = \u2212i\n2\nThe total energy of the \"dressed photon\" can be written as\nH=\n\nZ\n\nd3 r|\u03a8\u2032 (r, t)|2 .\n\n(14)\n\nThe \"dressed photon\" wave function can be decomposed in its energy eigenstates, which\nare plane-wave modes:\n\u2032\n\n\u03a8 (r, t) =\n\nXZ\ns\n\n3\n\nd k\n\ns\n\nh\u0304\u03c9\naks ei(k*r\u2212\u03c9t) \u00eaks\n3\n(2\u03c0)\n\n(15)\n\nwith s d3 k |aks |2 = 1, where the plane-wave modes are defined by q\ntheir wavevector k\nand polarization vector \u00eaks , with frequency given by \u03c9 = ck/n, n = (1 + \u03c7e )(1 + \u03c7m )\nbeing the refraction index of the medium.

The extension to higher dimensions is straightforward.\n5. Scattering of photons\nHere we want to find the behavior of the operators \u00ca and B\u0302 from (19) and (20)\nwhen, besides the linear medium with electric and magnetic susceptibilities \u03c7e and \u03c7m\noccupying all space, there is another medium in a finite region with different properties.\nOur treatment can be seen as an approximation of Keller's treatment for the photon\nscattering [9, 21] in the far-field regime. Applying the second quantization procedure\nincluding the interaction with matter, the operators \u03a8\u0302 will obey the same wave equation\n(3) as the wave functions \u03a8. So the operators \u00ca and B\u0302 will also obey (6) and (7).\nEquation (7) can be written in the following way\n\u2207\u00d7\n\n\u2202 \u00ca\nB\u0302\n=\u03b5\n+ \u0134\u2032 ,\n\u03bc\n\u2202t\n\n(26)\n\nwhere\n\"\n\n#\n\n\u03c7m B\n\u2202(\u03c7e E)\nJ \u2261J\u2212\u2207\u00d7\n\u2212\n(1 + \u03c7m )\u03bco\n\u2202t\n\u2032\n\n(27)\n\ncontain terms due to the difference of the behavior of the scattering medium in relation\nto the quantization medium, according to (4). Because the current density J\u2032 is a\nfunction of the electric and magnetic fields, when the fields become operators \u0134\u2032 also\nbecomes an operator.\nDifferentiating (26) with respect to time, using (6) and the vectorial identity\n\u2207 \u00d7 (\u2207 \u00d7 E) = \u2207(\u2207 * E) \u2212 \u22072 E, we obtain a wave equation for the operator \u00ca:\nn2 \u2202 2 \u00ca\n\u2202 \u0134\u2032\ne\ne\n\u2207 \u00ca \u2212 2 2 = \u22124\u03c0 f\u0302 , with f\u0302 = \u2212\u03bc0\n\u2212 \u2207(\u2207 * \u00ca).\nc \u2202t\n\u2202t\n2\n\n(28)\n\nThe above equation is a wave equation in which f\u0302 e is the source.

In linear media, we can use the same equation\nsubstituting the operator by the electric field of the photons, obtaining equivalent results\nto the scattering of an electromagnetic wave, since (30) is obtained from the Maxwell\nequations. But the interesting results come from the treatment of problems that cannot\nbe obtained from classical electrodynamics. In the next section, we will apply the\ntreatment to the scattering of a photon by a non-linear medium that can generate a\nphoton pair in an entangled state. We will show that the quantum state of the generated\nphoton pair we obtain is the same as the one previously obtained [23, 19, 24], but with\na more intuitive interpretation.\n6. Treatment of parametric down conversion\nThe parametric down conversion corresponds to the conversion of one incident photon in\ntwo by a non-linear birefringent crystal. As an example of application of the formalism\ndeveloped in the previous section, we will calculate the quantum state of the photon pair\ngenerated in the process of type-I parametric down conversion, in which both generated\nphotons have polarization orthogonal to the incident photon. To simplify the treatment,\nwe will consider that the non-linear crystal is immersed in a medium with the same linear\nresponses as the crystal. So the medium where the field is quantized occupies all space,\nand the non-linearities of the crystal will be responsible for the scattering processes.\n\n\fInteraction between light and matter: A photon wave function approach\n\n10\n\nThe magnetic\nq responses of these crystals are very small, so we can consider a refraction\nindex n = (1 + \u03c7e ). We will also disregard the dependence of the refraction index\nwith the propagation direction and the effects of dispersion. These approximations are\nconsistent with the observation of photons at small angles in relation to the propagation\ndirection of the incident photon and to the use of interference filters on the detectors,\npost-selecting states with relatively narrow frequency spectra.\nWith all these considerations, the non-linear components of the polarization of the\ncrystal can be written as\nP\u0302iN L (r, t) =\n\nX\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c7ijk \u00caj (r, t)\u00cak (r, t) ,\n\n(35)\n\nj,k\n\nwhere terms beyond the second order were disregarded. In type-I parametric down\nconversion, the generated photons have ordinary polarization and the incident photon\nhas extraordinary polarization. According to (4), the non-linear current density\n\u2032\nassociated with the ordinary polarization can be written as J\u02c6oN L = \u2202 P\u0302oN L /\u2202t, and\n\u2032\nthe scattering term, according to (28), is f\u02c6oe = \u2212\u03bc0 \u2202JoN L /\u2202t.

So the term (\u03c93 \u2212 \u03c91 )2 in the above equation may\nbe substituted by \u03c922 . The above form for the wave function of the twin photons\ngenerated by parametric down conversion is equivalent to previous treatments that\nconsider a Hamiltonian evolution of the quantum state of light interacting with a nonlinear medium using perturbation theory [23, 19].\nIf we use the form from (31) to the Green function, we arrive at a more intuitive\nform for the quantum state of the twin photons:\nZ t\nZ\nZ\nZ\nih\u0304\u03bc0\n(2)\n3 \u2032\n\u2032\nd\nr\ndk\ndk2 \u03c7\u2032 ooe (r\u2032 )E3\u2032 (r\u2032 , t\u2032 ) \u00d7\ndt\n\u03a8\u2032(2)\n(r\n,\nr\n,\nt)\n=\n\u2212\n1\n1 2\noo\n4(8\u03c0 2 )2\n\u2212\u221e\ni[k2 |r2 \u2212r\u2032 |\u2212\u03c92 (t\u2212t\u2032 )]\ni[k1 |r1 \u2212r\u2032 |\u2212\u03c91 (t\u2212t\u2032 )]\n2e\n2e\n\u03c92\n.\n(42)\n\u00d7 \u03c91\n|r1 \u2212 r\u2032 |\n|r2 \u2212 r\u2032 |\nWe can interpret the above wave function as being the result of the coherent\nscattering of one photon in two by all non-linear scatterers of the crystal. In each\none of these processes, the incident photon generates a pair of photons in spherical wave\nmodes emitted from each non-linear scatterer. The energy and momentum conservation\nin the process may be seen as consequences of the fundamental indistinguishability of all\npossible instants of time and positions in which a photon pair could be generated, which\nforces us to coherently add all the probability amplitudes. These probability amplitudes\ninterfere destructively when energy is not conserved. However, although the sum of the\nenergies of the twin photons is the energy of the incident photon, the energy of each\nphoton can assume a wide range of values. So, the photon pair is highly entangled in\nenergy. The probability amplitudes also interfere making the sum of the momenta of\nthe twin photons be associated with the momentum of the incident photon, depending\n\n\fInteraction between light and matter: A photon wave function approach\n\n12\n\non the crystal geometry since the crystal may absorb part of the momentum in the\nprocess. The momentum of each photon can also assume a wide range of values, so the\ngenerated photons are also entangled in linear momentum.\nComparing (41) and (25), we see that the post-selected wave function of the twin\nphotons on the wavevector space is proportional to\n\u221a\n\u03c91 \u03c92 Z \u2032 Z 3 \u2032 Z 3\n\u2032\n(2)\ndt d r d k3 \u03c7\u2032(2)\n\u03a8\u0303oo (k1 , k2 ) \u221d\nooe (r ) \u00d7\nn1 n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u00d7 \u1ebc3 (k3 )ei(k3 \u2212k1 \u2212k2 )*r \u2212i(\u03c93 \u2212\u03c91 \u2212\u03c92 )t .\n(43)\nLet us consider that the incident photon is in a beam mode that propagates in the \u1e91\ndirection and that the crystal is a rectangular box with dimensions much larger than the\nbeam waist in the x and y directions and a small width in the z direction. Let us also\ntreat the collinear regime, in which the crystal is oriented to maximize the production\nof photons with wavevectors near the \u1e91 direction. So the integrals in x and y in (43)\nmay be extended to infinity and the integral in z results in a constant. To illustrate\nthe energy and momentum entanglement of the state, let us represent the vectors k\nas k = q + kz \u1e91 and \u1ebc3 (k3 ) as \u1ebc3 (\u03c93 , q3 ), since \u03c93 and q3 determine k3 . Let us also\nsubstitute the integral in the \u1e91 component of k3 by an integral in \u03c93 . With all these\napproximations, the integral in t\u2032 gives \u03b4(\u03c93 \u2212 \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 ) and the integrals on x\u2032 and y \u2032\ngive \u03b4 2 (q3 \u2212q1 \u2212q2 ). So the 2-photon wave function on wavevector space can be written\nwithin the paraxial domain (|q| \u226a |k|) as [24]\n\u221a\n(44)\n\u03c91 \u03c92 \u1ebc3 (\u03c91 + \u03c92 , q1 + q2 ).\n\u03a8\u0303(2)\noo (\u03c91 , q1 , \u03c92 , q2 ) \u221d\nWe cannot write this wave function as a product of a wave function for photon 1 and\na wave function for photon 2, what characterizes the entanglement of the state in both\nenergy and momentum.\n7. Conclusions\nWe extended the Bialynicki-Birula\u2013Sipe photon wave function formalism to include the\ninteraction between photons and continuous non-absorptive media. The photon wave\nequation becomes equivalent to the macroscopic Maxwell equations in material media.\nApplying the second quantization procedure to the photon wave function, we obtained\nan alternative treatment for the quantum interactions between light and continuous\nmedia, that can be specially useful to treat the scattering of light by matter. As an\nexample of application of the proposed formalism, the quantum state of the twin photons\ngenerated by parametric down conversion was obtained in agreement with previous\ntreatments, but with a more intuitive interpretation.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors acknowledge Brian J.
