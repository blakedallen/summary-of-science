We introduce a new topological property called (\u2217) and the corresponding class of topological spaces, which includes spaces with G\u03b4 -diagonals and\nGruenhage spaces. Using (\u2217), we characterise those Banach spaces which admit\nequivalent strictly convex norms, and give an internal topological characterisation\n\u2217\nof those scattered compact spaces K, for which the dual Banach space C(K)\nadmits an equivalent strictly convex dual norm. We establish some relationships\nbetween (\u2217) and other topological concepts, and the position of several well-known\n\u2217\nexamples in this context. For instance, we show that C(K) admits an equivalent strictly convex dual norm, where K is Kunen's compact space. Also, under\nthe continuum hypothesis CH, we give an example of a compact scattered nonGruenhage space having (\u2217).\n\n1. Introduction\nHereafter, all Banach spaces will be assumed real and, unless explicitly stated\notherwise, all topological spaces will be Hausdorff. Throughout this paper we will\nbe defining new norms on existing Banach spaces. These new norms will always be\nequivalent to the given canonical norms. Banach space notation and terminology is\nstandard throughout.\nA norm k * k on a Banach space X is said to be strictly convex (or rotund) if,\ngiven x, y \u2208 X satisfying kxk = kyk = k 21 (x + y)k, we have x = y [5, p. 404].\nGeometrically, this means that the unit sphere SX of X in this norm has no nontrivial line segments, or, equivalently, every element of SX is an extreme point of\nthe unit ball BX .\nClearly, there are many Banach spaces whose natural norms are not strictly convex. However, by appealing to the linear and topological properties of a given space,\nit is often possible to define a new norm that is strictly convex. Changing the norm\nin this way is often called renorming. In certain cases, we would like the new norm\nDate: April 7, 2018.\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 46B03, 46B26, 54G12.\nKey words and phrases.

For instance, we may\nwish for a norm on a dual space X \u2217 to be w \u2217 -lower semicontinuous, so that it is\nthe dual of some norm on X. Alternatively, we may like a norm on a C(K)-space\nto be lower semicontinuous with respect to the topology of pointwise convergence.\nSuch additional requirements can make norms much more difficult to construct, but\nthey do bestow certain benefits. For example, if X \u2217 can be endowed with a strictly\nconvex dual norm then the predual norm on X is automatically G\u00e2teaux smooth,\nby virtue of \u0160mulyan's Lemma, cf. [8, Theorem I.1.4].\nDespite the natural and intuitive nature of strict convexity, the question of whether\na Banach space may be given such a norm turns out to be rather difficult to answer\nin general. A number of mathematicians have sought to establish more easily verifiable sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for a space to admit a strictly\nconvex norm. Before outlining this paper, we mention some of the contributions to\nthis collective endeavour. Specialists will realise that it is possible to endow many\n(but not all) of the spaces below with norms sporting stronger properties than strict\nconvexity, but we prefer not to dwell on such properties here. For a fuller discussion,\nwe refer the reader to [8, 36].\nIn [5, Theorem 9], it is shown that every separable Banach space admits a strictly\nconvex norm. By following Clarkson's proof, Day showed that if a Banach space X\nis separable then X \u2217 admits a strictly convex dual norm [6, Theorem 4]. If \u0393 is a\nset then c0 (\u0393) admits a strictly convex norm [6, Theorem 10] (see also [8, Definition\nII.7.2]). On the other hand, if \u0393 is uncountable then the space lc\u221e (\u0393) of countably\nsupported bounded functions x : \u0393 \u2212\u2192 R with the supremum norm is simply too\nbig to admit a strictly convex norm [6, Theorem 8] ([8, Theorem II.7.12]).\nAmir and Lindenstrauss showed that if X is weakly compactly generated (WCG)\nthen both X and X \u2217 admit a strictly convex norm and a strictly convex dual norm,\nrespectively [2, Theorem 3]. These results rely on the fact that if a bounded linear\nmap T : X \u2212\u2192 Y is injective and Y admits a strictly convex norm, then so does X.\nIf X is WCG then we can find such maps on both X and X \u2217 , where Y = c0 (\u0393) for\nsome \u0393. Then [6, Theorem 10] can be applied.\nAt the time, such a 'linear transfer' into some c0 (\u0393) was the only way of showing\nthat spaces admitted strictly convex norms. Moreover, lc\u221e (\u0393), \u0393 uncountable, was\nthe 'smallest' space known not to admit a strictly convex norm. In [9], the authors\nconstruct an increasing transfinite sequence (X\u03b1 )1\u2264\u03b1<\u03c91 of spaces of Baire-1 functions on [0, 1], all admitting strictly convex norms, and none admitting a bounded\nlinear injective map into any c0 (\u0393), provided \u03b1 \u2265 2. Moreover,\nby refining Day's\nS\nargument [6, Theorem 8], they showed that the union Y = \u03b1<\u03c91 X\u03b1 does not admit a strictly convex norm, and that there is no bounded linear injective map from\nlc\u221e ([0, 1]) into Y .\nThe fact that the dual of every WCG space admits strictly convex dual norm, with\na necessarily G\u00e2teaux smooth predual norm, prompted Lindenstrauss to conjecture\nthat if X admits a G\u00e2teaux smooth norm then it must embed as a subspace of\nsome WCG space [21]. Mercourakis provided a negative answer to this conjecture\nby showing that if X is a weakly countably determined (WCD) space, then both X\n2\n\n\fand X \u2217 admit strictly convex norms [22, Theorems 4.6 and 4.8], by virtue of linear\ntransfers (although not into c0 (\u0393) in general).\nPapers such as [9, 22] suggest that there is no simple way of characterising strict\nconvexity in terms of linear structure. Since then, the problem of classifying Banach\nspaces admitting strictly convex norms has been approached from a more topological\nperspective, and particular attention has been paid to strictly convex dual norms\nand C(K)-spaces. Any Banach space X embeds isometrically into C(BX \u2217 , w \u2217 ), and\nthis fact enables certain results about C(K)-spaces to be generalised to all Banach\nspaces, by phrasing them in terms of the topological structure of (BX \u2217 , w \u2217).\nFor example, if X \u2217 admits a strictly convex dual norm then (BX \u2217 , w \u2217) is fragmentable [30, Theorem 1.1]. We can say that a topological space is fragmentable if\nit admits, for each n \u2208 N, an increasing well ordered family of open subsets (U\u03be )\u03be<\u03bbn ,\nwith the property that given distinct points x and y, we can find some n0 and \u03be < \u03bbn0\nsuch that {x, y} \u2229 U\u03be is a singleton [29, Theorem 1.9]. The idea of point separation\nfeatures throughout this paper. Indeed, the notion of strict convexity can be viewed\nas a form of point separation.\nThe necessity condition above is far from sufficient however. The class of fragmentable spaces is very large and includes, for instance, all scattered spaces. Recall\nthat a topological space is scattered if every non-empty subspace admits a relatively\nisolated point. In the year before [22] appeared, Talagrand showed that the space\nC(\u03c91 + 1)\u2217 does not admit a strictly convex dual norm [38, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 3], where \u03c91\nis the first uncountable ordinal considered in its (scattered) order topology. On the\nother hand, the dual unit ball (BC(\u03c91 +1)\u2217 , w \u2217) is fragmentable [29, Theorem 3.1].\nThe next significant sufficiency condition we mention requires a definition.\nDefinition 1.1. A compact space\nS K is descriptive if it admits a \u03c3-isolated network,\nthat is to say, a family N = \u221e\nn=1 Nn of subsets of K, satisfying\nS\n(1) N \u2229 Nn \\ {N} is empty whenever N \u2208 Nn and n \u2208 N, and\n(2) if x \u2208 U \u2286 K, where U is open, then there exists n \u2208 N and N \u2208 Nn such\nthat x \u2208 N \u2286 U.\nThis topological covering property arose out of the theory of 'generalised metric\nspaces' [12]. The class of descriptive compact spaces is large. For example, if X\nis WCD then (BX \u2217 , w \u2217 ) is descriptive ([37, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 3.6] and [28, Corollary 2.4]).\nIn [28, Theorem 3.3], Raja showed that if K is descriptive then C(K)\u2217 admits a\nstrictly convex dual norm. This result can be adapted to give a sufficient condition\nwhich applies to a wide class of dual Banach spaces [26, Theorem 1.3], including\nduals of WCD spaces. We remark that a compact\nscattered space K is descriptive\nS\nif and only if it is \u03c3-discrete, that is, K = n=1 Dn , where each Dn is discrete in its\nrelative topology. This fact follows from [28, Lemma 2.2].\nDespite these advances, there is a very large gap between the class of descriptive\nspaces and \u03c91 + 1 and the more general class of fragmentable spaces. Some years\nprior to the publication of [28], Haydon constructed some strictly convex dual norms\non spaces of the form C(K)\u2217 , where the K are 1-point compactifications of certain\ntrees in their interval topologies [16, Theorem 7.1]. It turns out that some of these\n3\n\n\fspaces are not descriptive, so Haydon's sufficient condition is not covered by Raja's\numbrella.\nIn [33, Theorem 6], the second-named author generalised Haydon's result by characterising those trees for which the associated spaces C(K)\u2217 admit strictly convex\ndual norms. Later, in [34], this order-theoretic characterisation was reproved in\ninternal, topological terms. To state this result we need another definition.\nDefinition 1.2. A compact space K is called Gruenhage if there exists a sequence\n(Un )\u221e\nn=1 of families of open subsets of K, and sets Rn , n \u2265 1, with the property that\n(1) if x, y \u2208 K are distinct, then there exists n \u2208 N and U \u2208 Un , such that\n{x, y} \u2229 U is a singleton, and\n(2) U \u2229 V = Rn whenever U, V \u2208 Un are distinct.\nThis definition is equivalent to the original [13, p. 372] (see [34, Proposition 2]).\nEvery descriptive compact space is Gruenhage [34, Corollary 4].\nTheorem 1.3 ([34, Theorems 7 and 16]). Let K be compact. Then the following\nstatements hold.\n(1) If K is Gruenhage then C(K)\u2217 admits a strictly convex dual lattice norm.\n(2) If K is the 1-point compactification of a tree and C(K)\u2217 admits a strictly\nconvex dual norm, then K is Gruenhage.\nTheorem 1.3 (1) can be adapted to give a sufficient condition ([34, Corollary\n10]) which applies to class of dual Banach spaces even wider than that covered\nby [26, Theorem 1.3]. There are other instances of necessity besides Theorem 1.3\n(2). For instance, if the Banach space X has an (uncountable) unconditional basis\nthen X \u2217 admits a strictly convex dual norm if and only if (BX \u2217 , w \u2217) is Gruenhage\n(equivalently, if (BX \u2217 , w \u2217 ) is descriptive) [35, Theorem 6]. Despite some courageous\nattempts, it was not possible to prove the converse implication of Theorem 1.3 (1).\nMany of the results of this paper are the product of efforts to resolve this difficulty.\nThis paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we introduce a generalisation\nof Gruenhage's property, labeled (\u2217) (Definition 2.6), and use it to give a characterisation of Banach spaces which admit a strictly convex norm satisfying some\nadditional lower semicontinuity property (Theorem 2.8). This characterisation attempts to topologise as much as possible the geometric condition of strict convexity.\nIn Section 3, we use (\u2217) to find an analogue of Theorem 1.3 which applies to all\nscattered compact spaces (Theorem 3.1). This class is significant in Banach space\ntheory because C(K) is an Asplund space if and only if K is scattered. In doing so,\nwe show that (\u2217) comes close to providing a complete topological characterisation\nof those K, for which C(K)\u2217 admits a strictly convex dual norm. In Section 4, we\nestablish some of the topological properties of (\u2217) and its position in the wider context of covering properties, and provide some examples of scattered compact spaces,\nsome of which having (\u2217) and others not. In particular, we give an example of a\nscattered non-Gruenhage compact space having (\u2217) (Example 4.10). Thus, Theorem\n3.1 does not follow from previous results such as Theorem 1.3. Along the way, we\nanswer an open question concerning Kunen's compact space: specifically, we show\nthat it is Gruenhage (Proposition 4.7). In several cases, including Example 4.10, we\n4\n\n\fshall assume extra principles independent of the usual axioms of set theory. Finally,\nin Section 5, we present some open problems stemming from this study.\n2. A characterisation of strict convexity in Banach spaces\nIn this section, we provide a general characterisation of strictly convex renormings\nin Banach spaces. Throughout this section, X will be a Banach space (and occasionally a general topological space) and F \u2286 X \u2217 a norming subspace. Recall that\n\u03c3(X, F ) denotes the coarsest topology on X with respect to which every element\nof F is continuous. We begin by presenting a useful folklore result, together with a\nbrief sketch proof.\nProposition 2.1. Let F \u2286 X \u2217 be a norming subspace. Suppose that there exists a\nsequence of \u03c3(X, F )-lower semicontinuous convex functions \u03c6n : X \u2212\u2192 [0, \u221e) such\nthat given distinct x, y \u2208 X, we can find n \u2208 N satisfying\n(1)\n\n\u03c6n ( 12 (x + y)) < max{\u03c6(x), \u03c6(y)}.\n\nThen X admits a \u03c3(X, F )-lower semicontinuous strictly convex norm |||* |||. Instead,\nif X is a Banach lattice, (1) holds whenever x, y \u2208 X+ are distinct, and\n\u03c6n (x) \u2264 \u03c6n (y)\nwhenever |x| \u2264 |y| and n \u2208 N, then ||| * ||| is a \u03c3(X, F )-lower semicontinuous strictly\nconvex lattice norm.\nProof. Let k * k denote the original norm on X. We define a new norm by\nX\n|||x|||2 =\ncn,q kxk2n,q\nn,q\n\nwhere k * kn,q is the Minkowski functional of\n\b\nCn,q = x \u2208 X : \u03c6n (x)2 + \u03c6n (\u2212x)2 \u2264 q\n\nwhenever q is a rational number satisfying q > 2\u03c6n (0)2 , and where the constants\ncn,q > 0 are chosen to ensure the uniform convergence of the sum on bounded sets.\nBy a standard convexity argument (cf. [8, Fact II.2.3]), it can be shown that if\n|||x||| = |||y||| = 21 |||x + y||| then \u03c6n (x) = \u03c6n (y) = \u03c6n ( 21 (x + y)) for all n, whence\nx = y by hypothesis. If we adopt the lattice hypotheses instead then clearly ||| * |||\nis also a lattice norm, and strictly convex on X+ . To see that the strict convexity\nextends to all of X, let x, y \u2208 X and suppose that |||x||| = |||y||| = 12 |||x + y|||. Then\n1\n||| |x| + |y| ||| = |||x||| as well, so strict convexity on X+ yields |x| = |y|. If we set\n2\nw = 21 (x + y) then repeating the above gives us |x| = |w|. A simple lattice argument\n(e.g. [34, p. 749]) leads us to conclude that x = y.\n\u0003\nOur characterisation adopts several ideas from [25, 24]. Recall that if A is a subset\nof a locally convex space then an open slice U of A is the intersection of A with an\nopen half-space of X. The following proposition will be our main tool.\n5\n\n\fProposition 2.2. Let A be a bounded subset of X and U a family of non-empty\n\u03c3(X, F )-open slices of A. Then there exists a \u03c3(X, F )-lower semicontinuous\nS 1Lipschitz convex function \u03c6 with the property that whenever x, y \u2208 A, {x, y} \u2229 U\nis non-empty and\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c6(y) = \u03c6( 21 (x + y)),\nwe have x, y \u2208 U for some U \u2208 U .\nProposition 2.2 is an immediate corollary of the next result, dubbed the 'Slice\nLocalisation Theorem'.\nTheorem 2.3 ([25, Theorem 3]). Let A be a bounded subset of X and U a family\nof non-empty \u03c3(X, F )-open slices of A. Then there is an equivalent \u03c3(X, F )-lower\nsemicontinuous\nnorm k * k such that for every sequence (xn )\u221e\nn=1 \u2286 X and x \u2208\nS\nA \u2229 U , if\n2kxk2 + 2kxn k2 \u2212 kx + xn k2 \u2192 0,\nthen there is a sequence of slices (Un )\u221e\nn=1 \u2286 U and n0 \u2208 N such that\n(1) x, xn \u2208 Un whenever n \u2265 n0 and xn \u2208 A;\n(2) for every \u03b4 > 0 there is some n\u03b4 \u2208 N such that\nx, xn \u2208 (conv(A \u2229 Un ) + \u03b4BX )\n\n\u03c3(X,F )\n\nfor all n \u2265 n\u03b4 .\nThe Slice Localisation Theorem can be used to simplify the proofs of network\ncharacterisations of Banach spaces which admit locally uniformly rotund norms. To\nprove Proposition 2.2, all we need to do apply Theorem 2.3 with xn = y for all n.\nHowever, there is a more transparent proof of this proposition which we provide for\ncompleteness.\nOf key importance to the proof is the concept of F -distance, introduced in [24].\nLet D \u2286 X be a non-empty, convex bounded subset. Given \u03be \u2208 X \u2217\u2217 , define\n(1)\n\nk\u03bekF = sup {\u03be(f ) : f \u2208 BX \u2217 \u2229 F } .\n\nIt is clear that k * kF is \u03c3(X \u2217\u2217 , F )-lower semicontinuous (\u03c3(X \u2217\u2217 , F ) being the only\ngenerally non-Hausdorff topology mentioned in this paper). Now set\nn\no\n\u03c3(X \u2217\u2217 ,X \u2217 )\n\u03c6(x) = inf kx \u2212 dkF : d \u2208 D\n.\n\nDefinition 2.4. Given a non-empty, convex bounded subset D \u2286 X, we call \u03c6(x)\nthe F -distance from x \u2208 X to D.\n\nWe pass to the bidual of X in order to control the lower semicontinuity properties\nof \u03c6. The notion of F -distance has a number of useful properties which we list in\nthe next lemma.\nLemma 2.5. Let \u03c6(x) be the F -distance from x \u2208 X to D.\n(1) \u03c6 is convex and 1-Lipschitz;\n(2) \u03c6 is \u03c3(X, F )-lower semicontinuous;\n\u03c3(X,F )\n(3) D\n= \u03c6\u22121 (0).\n6\n\n\fProperties (1) and (2) are proved in [24, Proposition 2.1] and the third is a straightforward exercise involving the Hahn-Banach separation theorem. Now we can give\nour alternative proof of Proposition 2.2.\nProof of Proposition 2.2. For each U \u2208 U and x \u2208 X, define \u03c6U (x) to be the F distance from x to (conv A) \\ U. Since A is bounded, we can define another convex,\n\u03c3(X, F )-lower semicontinuous, 1-Lipschitz function by\n\u03c6(x) = sup {\u03c6U (x) : U \u2208 U } .\nS\nLet x, y \u2208 A with {x, y} \u2229 U non-empty and suppose that\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c6(y) = \u03c6( 21 (x + y)).\n\nWithout loss of generality, we can assume that x \u2208 U for some U \u2208 U . Since\n\u03c3(X,F )\nis empty, we have \u03c6(x) \u2265 \u03c6U (x) > 0 by Lemma 2.5, part (3).\nU \u2229 (conv A) \\ U\nPick \u03b5 > 0 such that \u03c6(x) > 5\u03b52 and choose V \u2208 U with the property that\n\u03c6( 21 (x + y))2 < \u03c6V ( 21 (x + y))2 + \u03b52 .\nWe have\n0 =\n>\n\u2265\n=\n\n1\n(\u03c6(x)2 + \u03c6(y)2) \u2212 \u03c6( 21 (x + y))2\n2\n1\n(\u03c6V (x)2 + \u03c6V (y)2) \u2212 \u03c6V ( 21 (x + y))2 \u2212 \u03b52\n2\n1\n(\u03c6V (x)2 + \u03c6V (y)2) \u2212 41 (\u03c6V (x) + \u03c6V (y))2 \u2212\n2\n1\n(\u03c6V (x) \u2212 \u03c6V (y))2 \u2212 \u03b52\n4\n\n\u03b52\n\nthus\n(2)\n\n|\u03c6V (x) \u2212 \u03c6V (y)| < 2\u03b5.\n\nSince \u03c6V is convex, we have max{\u03c6V (x), \u03c6V (y)} \u2265 \u03c6V ( 21 (x + y)). Together with (2),\nthis implies\nmin{\u03c6V (x), \u03c6V (y)} \u2265 max{\u03c6V (x), \u03c6V (y)} \u2212 2\u03b5\n\u2265 \u03c6V ( 21 (x + y)) \u2212 2\u03b5\n\u00011\n\u2265 \u03c6( 21 (x + y)) \u2212 \u03b52 2 \u2212 2\u03b5\n> 0.\nTherefore \u03c6V (x), \u03c6V (y) > 0. Since x, y \u2208 A, we get x, y \u2208 V .\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 2.2 motivates the introduction of the central topological concept featuring in this paper.\nDefinition 2.6. We say that a topological space X has (\u2217) if there exists a sequence\n(Un )\u221e\nn=1 of families of open subsets of X, with the property that given any x, y \u2208 X,\nthere exists n \u2208 N such that\nS\n(1) {x, y} \u2229 Un is non-empty, and\n(2) {x, y} \u2229 U is at most a singleton for all U \u2208 Un .\n7\n\n\fAny sequence (Un )\u221e\nn=1 satisfying the conditions of Definition 2.6 will be called a\n(\u2217)-sequence for X. In addition, if X is locally convex and A \u2286 X then we say A\nhas (\u2217) withSslices if A admits a (\u2217)-sequence (Un )\u221e\nn=1 , with the property that every\n\u221e\nelement of n=1 Un is an open slice of A.\nRemark 2.7. It will be convenient to note that if A \u2286 X, then to say that\n(A, \u03c3(X, F )) has (\u2217) with slices is equivalent to there being a family of subsets\nGn \u2286 (SX \u2217 \u2229 F ) \u00d7 R, n \u2208 N, such that given distinct x, y \u2208 A, we have n \u2208 N\nsatisfying\n(a) max{f (x), f (y)} > \u03bb for some (f, \u03bb) \u2208 Gn , and\n(b) min{g(x), g(y)} \u2264 \u03bc for every (g, \u03bc) \u2208 Gn .\nOur characterisation follows.\nTheorem 2.8. Let F \u2286 X \u2217 be a 1-norming subspace. Then the following are\nequivalent.\n(1) X admits a \u03c3(X, F )-lower semicontinuous strictly convex norm;\n(2) (X, \u03c3(X, F )) has (\u2217) with slices;\n(3) (SX , \u03c3(X, F )) has (\u2217) with slices;\n(4) there is a sequence of subsets (Xn )\u221e\nn=1 of X, such that\n\u221e\n[\n\b\n2\n(x, y) \u2208 X : x 6= y \u2286\nXn2\nn=1\n\nand where each (Xn , \u03c3(X, F )) has (\u2217) with slices.\n\nProof. (1) \u21d2 (2): let k * k be a \u03c3(X, F )-lower semicontinuous strictly convex norm\non X. Then F is also 1-norming for k * k. Let\nGq = (S(X,k*k)\u2217 \u2229 F ) \u00d7 {q}\nfor each rational number q > 0. We verify that (X, \u03c3(X, F )) has (\u2217) by showing\nthat the Gq satisfy (a) and (b) of Remark 2.7. Given distinct x, y \u2208 X, assume\nthat kxk \u2264 kyk. The strict convexity of k * k tells us that k 21 (x + y)k < kyk. Let\nrational q satisfy k 21 (x + y)k < q < kyk. Since F is 1-norming for k * k, we know\nthat f (y) > q for a pair (f, q) \u2208 Gq , giving (a). Now suppose g(y) > q for some\n(g, q) \u2208 Gq . Then certainly g(x) \u2264 q, else we would have\nq < 21 g(x + y) \u2264 12 kx + yk,\nwhich doesn't make any sense. This shows that (b) is also satisfied.\n(2) \u21d2 (3) is trivial because (\u2217) with slices is inherited by subspaces. (3) \u21d2 (2):\nif (SX , \u03c3(X, F )) has (\u2217) with slices then we take sets Gn , n \u2208 N that satisfy (a) and\n(b) of Remark 2.7. We can assume that Gn \u2286 (SX \u2217 \u2229 F ) \u00d7 (\u22121, 1) for every n. Given\nrational q, r > 0, set\nHq = (SX \u2217 \u2229 F ) \u00d7 {q}\n\nand\n\nLn,q,r = {(f, q(\u03bb + r)) : (f, \u03bb) \u2208 Gn } .\n\nWe claim that the Hq and Ln,q,r verify that (X, \u03c3(X, F )) has (\u2217), using Remark 2.7.\nLet x, y \u2208 X be distinct, with kxk \u2264 kyk. If kxk < kyk then we choose rational q\nto satisfy kxk < q < kyk. Since F is 1-norming, it is easy to check that (a) and (b)\n8\n\n\fare fulfilled by Hq . Now suppose kxk = kyk. We know that, with respect to x/kxk\nand y/kyk, (a) and (b) are satisfied by some Gn . Without loss of generality, assume\nf (x) > kxk\u03bb, where (f, \u03bb) \u2208 Gn . Our argument depends on the sign of \u03bb. If \u03bb \u2265 0\nthen choose rational q, r > 0 satisfying\nkxk\nf (x) > kxk(\u03bb + r)\nand\n< q < kxk.\n1+r\nThe constants have been arranged to ensure\n(3)\n\n\u03bc(kxk \u2212 q) < kxk \u2212 q < qr\n\nwhenever |\u03bc| < 1.\n\nWe have f (x) > kxk(\u03bb + r) > q(\u03bb + r). Now suppose that g(x) > q(\u03bc + r), where\n(g, \u03bc) \u2208 Gn . Then\ng(x) > q(\u03bc + r) > kxk\u03bc\nby equation (3) above. This means g(x/kxk) > \u03bc, whence g(y/kyk) \u2264 \u03bc by (b),\ngiving g(y) < q(\u03bc + r). In summary, we have shown that (a) and (b) of Remark 2.7\nare fulfilled by Ln,q,r . If instead \u03bb < 0, we choose r < \u2212\u03bb as above and ensure that\nq satisfies\nkxk\nkxk < q <\n.\n1\u2212r\nBy arguing similarly, we get what we want.\n(2) \u21d2 (4) follows easily by setting Xn = X. We finish by proving (4) \u21d2 (1). By\ntaking intersections with mBX , m \u2208 N, and reindexing if necessary, we can assume\nthat each XSn is bounded. Let each Xn have a (\u2217)-sequence (Un,m)\u221e\nm=1 , where each\n\u221e\nelement of m=1 Un,m is a (non-empty) \u03c3(X, F )-open slice of Xn . Let \u03c6n,m denote\nthe convex function constructed by applying Proposition 2.2 to Xn and the family\nUn,m . We have ensured that if x, y \u2208 X are distinct then we can find n and m such\nthat \u03c6n,m ( 21 (x + y)) < max{\u03c6n,m (x), \u03c6n,m (y)}. The rest follows from Proposition\n2.1.\n\u0003\nNote that Theorem 2.8 (1), (2) and (4) are also equivalent when F is simply a\nnorming subspace, rather than a 1-norming subspace. We end this section by giving\nan example to show that the reliance on slices in the statement of Theorem 2.8 is\nnecessary in general.\nExample 2.9. Let K be the product {0, 1}\u03c91 , endowed with the lexicographic order\ntopology. According to [17, Example 1], C(K) admits a Kadec norm k * k but no\nstrictly convex norm. By the definition of Kadec norms, the weak topology agrees\nwith the norm topology on S(C(K),k*k) . In particular (S(C(K),k*k) , w) is metrisable,\nmeaning that it has a \u03c3-discrete base and thus has (\u2217) as well. However, since k * k\ncannot be strictly convex, Theorem 2.8 implies that (S(C(K),k*k) , w) does not have\n(\u2217) with slices.\nWe conclude this section by giving a sufficient condition for constructing strictly\nconvex norms. Theorem 2.11 below can be applied to many spaces of significance to\nthe theory, such as the Mercourakis spaces c1 (\u03a3\u2032 \u00d7\u0393) (see [8, Section VI.6]), DashiellLindenstrauss spaces and spaces of the form C(K)\u2217 , where K is Gruenhage. The\nidea, which goes back to the classical norm of Day for c0 (\u0393) [6, Theorem 10], is to\n9\n\n\f'glue together' strictly convex norms on finite-dimensional spaces (which are readily\navailable) to obtain strictly convex norms on larger spaces. Elements of Theorem\n2.11 can be found in [11, Theorem 5]. Before giving the theorem, we state a simple\nfact.\nFact 2.10. Let \u03be : [0, 1] \u2212\u2192 R be a function satisfying \u03be(0)\u03be(1) < 0, and suppose\nthat \u03be+ and \u03be\u2212 are convex. Then for every \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1), we have\n(4)\n\n\u03be\u00b1 (\u03bb) < \u03bb\u03be\u00b1 (1) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03be\u00b1 (0).\n\nProof. Assume \u03be(0) > 0. Since \u03be\u00b1 are convex and \u03be is necessarily continuous, it is\neasy to see that there is a unique interval [a, b], where 0 < a \u2264 b < 1, such that\n\u03be(u) > \u03be(v) = 0 > \u03be(w)\nwhenever u \u2208 [0, a), v \u2208 [a, b] and w \u2208 (b, 1]. If \u03bb \u2208 [a, b] then clearly equation (4)\nholds for \u03be\u00b1 . Let \u03bb < a. Then \u03be\u2212 (\u03bb) = 0 and, as \u03be\u2212 (1) > 0, (4) holds for \u03be\u2212 . Since\n\u03be+ is convex, setting \u03bc = \u03bb/a gives\n\u03be+ (\u03bb) \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u03bc)\u03be+ (0) + \u03bc\u03be+ (a) = (1 \u2212 \u03bc)\u03be+ (0) < (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03be+ (0)\nso (4) holds for \u03be+ . The proof for the case \u03bb > b is similar.\n\n\u0003\n\nClearly, if \u03be is linear then \u03be\u00b1 are convex. The same is true if \u03be is positive and\nconvex.\nTheorem 2.11. Let \u0398n : X \u2212\u2192 l\u221e (\u0393n ) be a sequence of maps such that both\nfunctions x 7\u2192 \u0398n,\u00b1 (x)(\u03b3) are \u03c3(X, F )-lower semicontinuous and convex for every\n\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393n and n \u2208 N.\nLet us assume in addition that for all distinct x, y \u2208 X, there are \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1), n \u2208 N\nand a finite set A \u2286 \u0393n , such that\n(1)\n\n\u0398n (x)\u21beA 6= \u0398n (y)\u21beA , and\n\n(2)\n\n|\u0398n (z)(\u03b1)| > |\u0398n (z)(\u03b3)| whenever \u03b1 \u2208 A and \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 \\ A,\n\nwhere z = \u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y. Then X admits a \u03c3(X, F )-lower semicontinuous strictly\nconvex norm ||| * |||.\nInstead, if X is a Banach lattice, \u0398n,\u00b1 (x) \u2264 \u0398n,\u00b1 (y) whenever |x| \u2264 |y| and\nequations (1) and (2) apply to distinct x, y \u2208 X+ , then ||| * ||| is a \u03c3(X, F )-lower\nsemicontinuous strictly convex lattice norm.\nProof. Since \u0398n,\u00b1 (*)(\u03b3) are both convex and \u03c3(X, F )-lower semicontinuous, the same\nis true of |\u0398n (*)(\u03b3)|. Define\n\u0398n,0 (x)(\u03b3) = \u03982n (x)(\u03b3)\nIf \u0393 =\n\nS\u221e\n\nn=1 \u0393n ,\n\nand\n\n\u0398n,\u00b11 (x)(\u03b3) = \u0398n,\u00b1 (x)(\u03b3).\n\nu \u2208 l\u221e (\u0393) and A \u2286 \u0393 is finite, set\nX\n\u03c6A (u) =\nu(\u03b3)\n\u03b3\u2208A\n\nand put \u03c6A,n,i = \u03c6A \u25e6 \u0398n,i for every n \u2208 N and i \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}. Certainly, each \u03c6A,n,i\nis \u03c3(X, F )-lower semicontinuous, non-negative and convex. Finally, let\n\u03c8m,n,i (x) = sup {\u03c6A,n,i (x) : A \u2286 \u0393n has cardinality m} .\n10\n\n\fTo finish the proof, we shall show that for every distinct pair x, y \u2208 X, there is\nm, n \u2208 N and i \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1} such that\n\u03c8m,n,i ( 21 (x + y)) < max{\u03c8m,n,i (x), \u03c8m,n,i (y)}.\n\n(5)\n\nholds. Then we can appeal to Proposition 2.1.\nTake \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1), n \u2208 N and A \u2286 \u0393n satisfying (1) and (2). We consider two cases.\nFirst suppose that \u0398n (x)(\u03b2)\u0398n (y)(\u03b2) < 0 for some \u03b2 \u2208 A. From (2) we know that\n\u0398n (z)(\u03b2) 6= 0. Assume for now that \u0398n (z)(\u03b2) > 0 and define the non-empty set\nB = {\u03b1 \u2208 A : \u0398n,+ (z)(\u03b1) > 0} .\nso that\n\u0398n,+ (z)(\u03b1) > \u0398n,+ (z)(\u03b3)\nP\nfor every \u03b1 \u2208 B and \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 \\ B. Therefore \u03c8n,m,1 (z) = \u03b1\u2208B \u0398n (z)(\u03b1), where m is\nthe cardinality of B. Applying Fact 2.10 to \u03be(t) = \u0398n (tx + (1 \u2212 t)y)(\u03b2), t \u2208 [0, 1],\nwe get\n\u0398n,+ (z)(\u03b2) < \u03bb\u0398n,+ (x)(\u03b2) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u0398n,+ (y)(\u03b2)\nwhence\n\u03c8n,m,1 (z) < \u03bb\u03c8n,m,1 (x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03c8n,m,1 (y)\nfrom which (5) quickly follows for i = 1, by convexity. If \u0398n (z)(\u03b2) < 0 then we\nargue similarly with i = \u22121.\nLet's now consider the case\n(6)\n\n\u0398n (x)(\u03b1)\u0398n (y)(\u03b1) \u2265 0\n\nfor all \u03b1 \u2208 A. Let m \u2208 N be the cardinality of A. Since t 7\u2192 t2 is strictly convex,\nfrom condition (1) we have\nX\nX\n(\u03bb\u0398n (x)(\u03b1) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u0398n (y)(\u03b1))2 <\n\u03bb(\u0398n (x)(\u03b1))2 + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)(\u0398n (y)(\u03b1))2\n\u03b1\u2208A\n\n\u03b1\u2208A\n\n= \u03bb\u03c6A,n,0(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03c6A,n,0(y)\n\u2264 \u03bb\u03c8m,n,0 (x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03c8m,n,0 (y)\n\u2264 max{\u03c8m,n,0 (x), \u03c8m,n,0 (y)}.\n\nGiven the convexity of |\u0398n (*)(\u03b1)| and equation (6), we obtain\n|\u0398n (z)(\u03b1)| = |\u0398n (\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y)(\u03b1)| \u2264 |\u03bb\u0398n (x)(\u03b1) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u0398n (y)(\u03b1)|.\nThis and condition (2) imply\n\u03c8m,n,0 (z) = \u03c6A,n,0(z) \u2264\n\nX\n\n(\u03bb\u0398n (x)(\u03b1) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u0398n (y)(\u03b1))2.\n\n\u03b1\u2208A\n\nCombining these inequalities we see that\n\u03c8m,n,0 (z) < max{\u03c8m,n,0 (x), \u03c8m,n,0 (y)}\nfrom which (5) follows for i = 0, again by convexity. If we adopt the lattice assumptions instead, then each \u03c8n,m,i satisfies the lattice assumptions in Proposition\n2.1.\n\u0003\n11\n\n\fIn the first corollary below is a sufficient condition of 'Mercourakis type', which\nis formally more general than similar conditions given in the literature.\nCorollary 2.12. Let X be a subspace or sublattice of l\u221e (\u0393) and suppose that there\nare subsets \u0393n \u2286 \u0393, n \u2208 N, with the property that given x \u2208 X and \u03b1 \u2208 supp x, we\ncan find n and \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393n , so that\n{\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393n : |x(\u03b3)| \u2265 |x(\u03b1)|}\nis finite. Then X admits a pointwise lower semicontinuous strictly convex norm or\nlattice norm, respectively.\nProof. Let Pn (x)(\u03b3) = |x(\u03b3)| whenever \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393n and n \u2208 N. The coordinate maps are\npositive and convex. We show that Pn satisfies conditions (1) and (2) of Theorem\n2.11. Given distinct x, y \u2208 X, take n \u2208 N and \u03b2 \u2208 \u0393n such that x(\u03b2) 6= y(\u03b2). Then\nthere is \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1) such that \u03bbx(\u03b2) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y(\u03b2) is non-zero. Set z = \u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y\nand take n \u2208 N such that\nA = {\u03b1 \u2208 \u0393n : |z(\u03b1)| \u2265 |z(\u03b2)|}\nis finite. Evidently \u03b2 \u2208 A, so Pn (x)\u21beA 6= Pn (y)\u21beA , and\n|Pn (z)(\u03b1)| \u2265 |z(\u03b2)| > |Pn (z)(\u03b3)|\nwhenever \u03b1 \u2208 A and \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393n \\ A.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 2.13 ([34, Theorem 7]). If K is Gruenhage then C(K)\u2217 admits a strictly\nconvex dual lattice norm.\nProof. If K is Gruenhage then (cf. [34, Lemma 6]), we can find sequences (Un )\u221e\nn=1\n\u2217\nand (Rn )\u221e\nn=1 as in Definition 1.2, with the further property that if \u03bc \u2208 C(K) and\n\u03bc(U) = 0 for all U \u2208 Un , n \u2208 N, then \u03bc = 0. Let \u0393n = Un and define\n\u0398n (\u03bc)(U) = |\u03bc|(U),\n\nU \u2208 Un .\n\nSince |\u03bb\u03bc + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03bd| \u2264 \u03bb|\u03bc| + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)|\u03bd| whenever \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], the coordinate maps\n\u0398n (*)(U) are positive and convex. If \u03bc, \u03bd \u2208 C(K)\u2217 are positive and distinct, then\nthere exists n \u2208 N and U \u2208 Un such that \u03bc(U) 6= \u03bd(U). If we set \u03c4 = 21 (\u03bc + \u03bd) then\nwe have \u03c4 (U) > \u03c4 (Rn ). By considering Definition 1.2 part (2), we see that for any\nr > \u03c4 (Rn ), there are only finitely many V \u2208 Un satisfying \u03c4 (V ) \u2265 r. Therefore,\nconditions (1) and (2) of Theorem 2.11 apply to positive elements of C(K)\u2217 . Now\nwe are able to apply Theorem 2.11.\n\u0003\nDashiell-Lindenstrauss spaces can be shown to have strictly convex lattice norms\nin a similar way.\n3. Strictly convex dual norms on C(K)\u2217\nEvidently, Theorem 2.8 relies on geometric assumptions, in the sense that only\nsets having (\u2217) with slices are considered. According to Example 2.9, it is not always\npossible to remove the reliance on slices and deal instead with open sets having no\nspecial geometric properties. However, we can live without slices in an important\nspecial case. We devote this section to proving the next result.\n12\n\n\fTheorem 3.1. Let K be a scattered compact space. Then C(K)\u2217 admits a strictly\nconvex dual (lattice) norm if and only if K has (\u2217).\nRecall that any compact space K embeds naturally into (C(K)\u2217 , w \u2217) by identifying\npoints t \u2208 K with their Dirac measures \u03b4t . It follows therefore from Theorem 3.1\nthat if K is scattered and (C(K)\u2217 , w \u2217 ) has (\u2217) (without slices), then (C(K)\u2217 , w \u2217)\nhas (\u2217) with slices. One implication of Theorem 3.1 may be proved easily.\nProposition 3.2. If C(K)\u2217 admits a strictly convex dual norm then K has (\u2217).\nProof. By Theorem 2.8, if C(K)\u2217 admits a strictly convex dual norm then (C(K)\u2217 , w \u2217)\nhas (\u2217), whence K has (\u2217) by the natural embedding.\n\u0003\nIn order to prove the converse implication, we need to refine our (\u2217)-sequences\nso that they satisfy some additional properties. Assume that a topological space\nX admits a (\u2217)-sequence (Un )\u221e\nn=1 . Given any finite sequence of natural numbers\n\u03c3 = (n1 , . . . , nk ), we define the family\n(k\n)\n\\\nU\u03c3 =\nUi : Ui \u2208 Uni for all i \u2264 k .\ni=1\n\nLet us also set Cn =\n\nS\n\nUn and C\u03c3 =\n\nS\n\nU\u03c3 .\n\nLemma 3.3. Assume that F \u2286 X is a finite subset such that for all n, either\nF \u2229 Cn = \u2205 or F \u2286 Cn . Then there exists \u03c3 = (n1 , . . . , nk ) such that F \u2286 C\u03c3 and,\nmoreover, F \u2229 V is at most a singleton for all V \u2208 U\u03c3 .\nProof. Enumerate the set of doubletons {x, y} \u2286 F as {x1 , y1 }, . . . , {xk , yk }. For\nevery i, there exists ni such that {xi , yi } \u2229 Cni is non-empty and {xi , yi } \u2229 V is\nat most a singleton for all V \u2208 Uni . By hypothesis, we have F \u2286 Cni for all\ni. Put \u03c3 = (n1 , . . . , nk ). If x \u2208 F , since F \u2286 Cni for all i, let Ui \u2208 Uni so\nT\nT\nthat x \u2208 ki=1 Ui \u2208 U\u03c3 . Therefore F \u2286 C\u03c3 . Given V = ki=1 Vi \u2208 U\u03c3 and distinct\nx, y \u2208 F , we have some i such that {x, y} \u2229W is at most a singleton for all W \u2208 Uni .\nIn particular, {x, y} \u2229 V \u2286 {x, y} \u2229 Vi is at most a singleton. This proves that F \u2229 V\nis at most a singleton for any V \u2208 U\u03c3 .\n\u0003\nBearing in mind the U\u03c3 , Lemma 3.3, and by adding new singleton families if\nnecessary, if X has (\u2217) then we can assume that there exists a (\u2217)-sequence with\nadditional properties, which we list in the next lemma.\nLemma 3.4. If X has (\u2217) then it admits a (\u2217)-sequence (Un )\u221e\nn=1 with the following\nproperties.\n(1) X = C1 ;\n(2) given n1 , . . . , nk \u2208 N, there exists m \u2208 N such that\n(k\n)\n\\\nUm =\nUi : Ui \u2208 Uni for all i \u2264 k ;\ni=1\n\n(3) if F is a finite subset of X such that for each n \u2208 N, either F \u2286 Cn or F \u2229Cn\nis empty, then there exists m \u2208 N with two properties:\n13\n\n\f(a) F \u2286 Cm ;\n(b) F \u2229 V is at most a singleton for all V \u2208 Um .\nArmed with these enhanced (\u2217)-sequences, we can deliver the proof of Theorem\n3.1. We ask that our compact spaces be scattered because the proof relies on the\nassumption that all measures in C(K)\u2217 are atomic.\nProof of Theorem 3.1. One implication was proved in Proposition 3.2. Now assume\nthat K is scattered and let (Un )\u221e\nn=1 be a (\u2217)-sequence for K satisfying the properties\nof Lemma 3.4. Given n \u2265 1, k \u2265 0 and finite L \u2286 N, define the seminorm\n(\n!\n)\n[\n[\nk\u03bckn,k,L = sup |\u03bc|\nCi \u222a\nF : F \u2286 Un and card F = k .\ni\u2208L\n\nWe show that these seminorms satisfy the requirements of Proposition 2.1. To this\nend, suppose that \u03bc and \u03bd are positive, and that\n\n(7)\n\nk\u03bckn,k,L = k\u03bdkn,k,L = 21 k\u03bc + \u03bdkn,k,L\n\nfor all n, k and L. For a contradiction, we shall suppose also that \u03bc 6= \u03bd. Since\nk\u03bck1,0,{n} = \u03bc(Cn )\nwe have \u03bc(Cn ) = \u03bd(Cn ) = 21 (\u03bc + \u03bd)(Cn ) for all n, by (7). By Lemma 3.4 (1) and\n(2), and the inclusion-exclusion principle, if I \u2286 N then we know that\n\u03bc(CI,n ) = \u03bd(CI,n ) = 21 (\u03bc + \u03bd)(CI,n )\nwhere\nCI,n =\n\n\\\n\nCi \\\n\ni\u2264n,i\u2208I\n\n[\n\nCi .\n\ni\u2264n,i\u2208I\n/\n\nBy monotone convergence, it follows that\n\n\u03bc(CI ) = \u03bd(CI ) = 12 (\u03bc + \u03bd)(CI )\nwhere\nCI =\n\n\\\n\nCi \\\n\ni\u2208I\n\n[\n\nCi .\n\ni\u2208N\\I\n\nNow K is the disjoint union of the CI , where I ranges over non-empty subsets of N,\nand since \u03bc 6= \u03bd are atomic, we can find non-empty I \u2286 N such that \u03bc\u21beI 6= \u03bd\u21beI . We\nfix this I from now on. Take a countable set A \u2286 CI such that we can write\nX\nX\n\u03bc\u21beI =\nat \u03b4t\nand\n\u03bd\u21beI =\nbt \u03b4t\nt\u2208A\n\nt\u2208A\n\nfor some numbers at , bt \u2265 0.

By Lemma 3.4 (3), we can find\nm \u2208 NTsuch that G \u2286 Cm and G \u2229 V is at most aTsingleton for all V \u2208 Um . Since\nCI \u2286 i\u2208H Ci , we can and do assume that Cm \u2286 i\u2208H Ci , by Lemma 3.4 (2).\nIt is by considering the seminorm k * km,k+1,L that we reach our contradiction. Let\nu \u2208 A such that au 6= bu and max{au , bu } = p. Clearly u \u2208\n/ F . Also, F \u222a {u} \u2286 G.\nIndeed, if t \u2208 A \\ G then at , bt < 41 (p \u2212 q) < p. Without loss of generality, assume\nthat au < bu = p. Since F \u222aS\n{u} \u2286 Cm , it is possible to find G \u2286 Um of cardinality\nk + 1, such that F \u222a {u} \u2286 G .\n\u0001\n\u0001\nS\nS\nBy considering k * k1,0,L and (7), we know that \u03bc i\u2208L Ci = \u03bd\ni\u2208L Ci .

Most of Theorem 3.1 follows from Theorem 2.8. Starting with a\n(\u2217)-sequence from Lemma 3.4, we can show directly that (C(K)\u2217 , w \u2217) has (\u2217) with\nslices. For n, k \u2208 N, finite L \u2286 N and rational q > 0, define Vn,k,L,q,+ to be the\nfamily of all w \u2217-open sets\n(\n!\n)\n[\n[\n\u03bc \u2208 C(K)\u2217 : \u03bc+\nCi \u222a\nF >q\ni\u2208L\n\nwhere F \u2286 Un has cardinality k. Define Vn,k,L,q,\u2212 accordingly. By using essentially\nthe same method as that presented above, it can be shown that the Vn,k,L,q,\u00b1 form\na (\u2217)-sequence. Moreover, if V \u2208 Vn,k,L,q,\u00b1 then C(K)\u2217 \\ V is convex. By the HahnBanach Theorem, each such V can be written as a union of w \u2217 -open half-spaces.\nTherefore, we can write down a (\u2217)-sequence for (C(K)\u2217 , w \u2217 ), the elements of which\nbeing families of half-spaces. What we lose here is the fact that the norm in Theorem\n3.1 is a lattice norm, which is why we give the proof as is.\n16\n\n\f4. Topological properties of (\u2217) and examples\nIn this section, we explore the properties of (\u2217) and see how it compares with\nrelated concepts in the literature. In particular, under the continuum hypothesis\n(CH), we provide an example of a compact scattered non-Gruenhage space K having\n(\u2217). This means that Theorem 3.1 does not follow from existing results such as\nTheorem 1.3.\nA topological space X is said to have a G\u03b4 -diagonal if its diagonal\n{(x, x) : x \u2208 X}\nis a G\u03b4 set in X 2 . This concept has been studied extensively in general metrisation\ntheory; see, for example [12, Section 2]. It is easy to show that X has a G\u03b4 -diagonal\nif and only if the admits a sequence (Gn )\u221e\nn=1 of open covers of X, such that given\nx, y \u2208 X, there exists n with the property that {x, y} \u2229 U is at most a singleton for\nall U \u2208 Gn [12, Theorem 2.2]. Equivalently, if we consider the 'stars'\n[\nst(x, n) =\n{U \u2208 Gn : x \u2208 U } ,\nT\nthen \u221e\nn=1 st(x, n) = {x} for every x \u2208 X. In keeping with previous notation, we\ncall such a sequence a G\u03b4 -diagonal sequence. Compact spaces with G\u03b4 -diagonals\nare metrisable (cf. [12, Theorem 2.13]), so (\u2217) is evidently a strict generalisation of\nthe G\u03b4 -diagonal property. In some cases, it is possible to reduce problems about\n(\u2217) to the G\u03b4 -diagonal case; see Theorem 4.3 and Proposition 4.12, and also the\npartitioning of K into the CI in the proof of Theorem 3.1.\nNext, we compare (\u2217) with Gruenhage's property.\nProposition 4.1. If X is Gruenhage then it has (\u2217).\nProof. If X is Gruenhage then let (Un )\u221e\nn=1 and Rn be as in Definition 1.2. Let\nVn = {Rn } for each n. Given distinct x, y \u2208 X, there exists n and U \u2208 Un ,\nsuch that {x, y} \u2229 U is a singleton. If x \u2208 Rn then y \u2208\n/ Rn and it is true that\n{x, y} \u2229 U = {x} for every U \u2208 Vn , because Vn is a singleton. Likewise if y \u2208 Rn . So\nwe assume now that x, y \u2208\n/ Rn . Now it is true that {x, y} \u2229 V is at most a singleton\nfor every V \u2208 Un , since if y \u2208 V then V 6= U, and if x \u2208 V then x \u2208 U \u2229V = Rn . \u0003\nThere are an abundance of compact spaces which are Gruenhage, but non-descriptive\nand so quite far from being metrisable; see [34, Corollary 17] or Theorem 4.6 and\nsubsequent remarks, below. In Example 4.10, we show that under CH there exists a\ncompact, scattered non-Gruenhage space that has (\u2217). Now we see that (\u2217) implies\nfragmentability.\nProposition 4.2. If X has (\u2217) then X is fragmentable.\nn\nProof. Let X have Sa (\u2217)-sequence (Un )\u221e\nn=1 . We well order each Un as (U\u03be )\u03be<\u03bbn .\nn\nn\nNow define V\u03b1 = \u03be\u2264\u03b1 U\u03be , for \u03b1 < \u03bbn . We claim that given distinct x, y \u2208 X,\nthere exists n and \u03b1 < \u03bbn such that {x, y} \u2229 V\u03b1n is a singleton. As explained in the\nIntroduction, this is enough to give fragmentability. Indeed, take n \u2208 N with the\n\n17\n\n\fproperties given in Definition 2.6, and pick the least \u03b1 < \u03bbn such that {x, y} \u2229 U\u03b1n\nis a singleton. Then {x, y} \u2229 U\u03ben must be empty for all \u03be < \u03b1, thus\n{x, y} \u2229 V\u03b1n = {x, y} \u2229 U\u03b1n\nis a singleton.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 4.3 below is a generalisation of a result of Chaber (cf. [12, Theorem\n2.14]), which states that countably compact spaces with G\u03b4 -diagonals are compact\n(and thus metrisable). It allows us to glean a few more topological consequences\nof the (\u2217) property. As preparation, fix an open cover V of a countably compact\nS\n(non-empty) space X. Suppose that X has a (\u2217)-sequence (Un )\u221e\nUn\nn=1 , with Cn =\nfor each n. Define\n(\n)\n[\nAX = I \u2286 N : X \\\nCn 6= \u2205 .\nn\u2208I\n\nClearly, AX is a hereditary family of subsets of N. Moreover, it is compact in the\npointwise topology. Indeed, if J \u2208\n/ AX , then by the countable compactness of X,\nwe can find finite G \u2286 J such that G \u2208\n/ AX . It follows that P(N) \\ AX is open.\nFurthermore, \u2205 \u2208 AX because X is non-empty, so AX is also non-empty. From\nthese facts, we deduce that AX admits an element that is maximal with respect to\ninclusion.\nTheorem 4.3. If X is countably compact and has (\u2217) then X is compact.\nProof. Fix an open cover V of X and (\u2217)-sequence (Un )\u221e\nn=1 as above. We define a\ndecreasing transfinite sequence of countably compact subspaces X\u03b1 of X, together\nwith maximal M\u03b1 \u2208 AX\u03b1 and finite F\u03b1 \u2286 V , such that\nS\nS\n(1) X\u03b1 = X \\ \u03be<\u03b1 F\u03be ;\n(2) M\u03be \u2208\n/ AX\u03b1 whenever \u03be < \u03b1.\nTo begin, S\nset X0 = X. Given X\u03b1 , we take some maximal M\u03b1 \u2208 AX\u03b1 and set\nY = X\u03b1 \\ n\u2208M\u03b1 Cn . We claim that (Un )n\u2208N\\M\u03b1 is a G\u03b4 -diagonal sequence for Y .\nIndeed, the maximality of M\u03b1 implies that Y \u2286 Cn whenever n \u2208 N\\M\u03b1 . If x, y \u2208 Y\nthen by (\u2217), there exists n such that {x, y} \u2229 Cn is non-empty, and {x, y} \u2229 U is at\nmost a singleton for all U \u2208 Un . By definition, Y \u2229 Ck is empty whenever k \u2208 M\u03b1 ,\nso necessarily n \u2208 N \\ M\u03b1 . Our claim is proved.\nBy Chaber's result, Y is compact. Therefore there exists a finite set F\u03b1 \u2286 V ,\nsuch that\n[\n[\nCn = Y \u2286\nF\u03b1 .\nX\u03b1 \\\nn\u2208M\u03b1\n\nX\u03b1\u2032\n\nS\n\nDefine X\u03b1+1 =\n= X\u03b1 \\ F\u03b1 . We have (1) immediately and (2) follows because\nIf \u03bb\nM\u03b1 \u2208\n/ AX\u03b1+1 and AX\u03b1+1 \u2286 AX\u03b1 . If X\u03b1+1 is empty then we stop the recursion.\nT\nis a countable limit ordinal and X\u03b1 is non-empty for all \u03b1 < \u03bb, set X\u03bb = \u03b1<\u03bb X\u03b1 .\n(1) and (2) follow. By countable compactness, X\u03bb is also non-empty.\nThis process has to stop at a countable (successor) stage, because (AX\u03b1 ) is a\nstrictly decreasing family of closed subsets of the separable metric space P(N). Thus,\n18\n\n\fX\u03b1+1 is empty for some \u03b1 < \u03c91 . By (1), we get\n[[\nX\u2286\nF\u03be\n\u03be\u2264\u03b1\n\nS\n\nand so X is covered by \u03be\u2264\u03b1 F\u03be . By a final application of countable compactness,\nwe extract from this a finite subcover.\n\u0003\nThe next result generalises [26, Corollary 4.3] from descriptive spaces to spaces\nwith (\u2217).\nCorollary 4.4. If L is locally compact and has (\u2217) then L \u222a {\u221e} is countably tight\nand sequentially closed subsets of L \u222a {\u221e} are closed.\n\nProof. The first assertion follows directly from Theorem 4.3 and the second follows\nfrom Proposition 4.2 and the fact that compact fragmentable spaces are sequentially\ncompact (see [29, Corollary 2.7] and [10, Lemma 2.1.1]). Notice that if L is any\nlocally compact space with (\u2217) then its 1-point compactification L \u222a {\u221e} has (\u2217)\nalso. All we need to do is adjoin to any (\u2217)-sequence for L the singleton family {L},\nwhich separates all points in L from \u221e.\n\u0003\nConcerning stability properties of (\u2217) under mappings, we have the next result.\nProposition 4.5. If K is a scattered compact space with (\u2217) and \u03c0 : K \u2212\u2192 M is a\ncontinuous, surjective map then M has (\u2217).\nProof. If K has (\u2217) then by Theorem 3.1, C(K)\u2217 admits a strictly convex dual norm\nk * k. If we define T : C(M) \u2212\u2192 C(K) by T (f ) = f \u25e6 \u03c0, it is standard to check that\n|||\u03bd||| = inf {k\u03bck : T \u2217 (\u03bc) = \u03bd}\ndefines a strictly convex dual norm on C(M)\u2217 . Therefore M has (\u2217), again by\nTheorem 3.1.\n\u0003\nThe proof above is concise and straightforward, but also utterly opaque, as it\nleaves the reader with no idea of how to construct a (\u2217)-sequence on M in terms\nof a (\u2217)-sequence on K. We outline a second approach to proving Proposition 4.5,\nwhich we include because we believe it gives the reader more idea of what is going\non. The dual map S = T \u2217 above is a natural extension of \u03c0 if we identify points in\nK and M with their Dirac measures in C(K)\u2217 and C(M)\u2217 , respectively. Set\n\u03a3 = {\u03bc \u2208 C(K)\u2217 : \u03bc is positive and k\u03bck1 = 1} .\nIf t \u2208 M and \u03bc \u2208 \u03a3 then S(\u03bc) = t if and only if supp \u03bc \u2286 \u03c0 \u22121 (t). Given a (\u2217)sequence (Un )\u221e\nn=1 on K with the properties of Lemma 3.4, together with the unions\nCn , define the w \u2217 -compact and convex sets\n(\n!\n)\n[\nDn,q,L = \u03bc \u2208 \u03a3 : \u03bc\nCi \u222a U \u2264 q for all U \u2208 Un\ni\u2208L\n\nwhere n \u2208 N, q \u2208 (0, 1) \u2229 Q and L \u2286 N is finite. The Dn,q,L should be compared to\nthe seminorms k * kn,k,L in the proof of Theorem 3.1. Given distinct s, t \u2208 M and\n\u03bc, \u03bd \u2208 \u03a3 in S \u22121 (s) and S \u22121 (t) respectively, by following the proof of Theorem 3.1,\n19\n\n\fwe can find n and q and L such that 12 (\u03bc + \u03bd) \u2208 Dn,q,L , but {\u03bc, \u03bd} \u2229 Dn,q,L is at\nmost a singleton. There is less to consider in this case because as the supports of \u03bc\nand \u03bd are necessarily disjoint, the set F in the proof of Theorem 3.1 is empty. This\nis why we only need to consider individual elements of Un in the definition of the\nDn,q,L , rather than finite subsets of Un as in the definition of the k * kn,k,L.\nBy appealing to compactness and convexity, it is possible to select a finite set\nG\nproperty that if we consider the intersection DG =\nS of triples (n, q, L) with the \u22121\n( 21 (s + t)) is non-empty, but either DG \u2229 S \u22121 (s) is\n(n,q,L)\u2208G Dn,q,L , then DG \u2229 S\nempty, or DG \u2229 S \u22121 (t) is empty. Equivalently, 21 (s + t) \u2208 S(DG ), but {s, t} \u2229 S(DG )\nis at most a singleton. The set S(DG ) is w \u2217 -compact and convex, so the complement\nC(M)\u2217 \\ S(DG ) can be written as the union of a family VG of w \u2217 -open halfspaces\nof C(M)\u2217 . From what we know, it can be easily verified that the families VG , as G\nranges over all finite subsets of triples (n, q, L), induce a (\u2217)-sequence on M.\nNow we move on to examples. We are chiefly interested in exploring (\u2217), Gruenhage's property and the gap between them. Given that descriptive spaces are\nGruenhage and spaces with (\u2217) are fragmentable, we shall confine our attention to\nspaces that are fragmentable but non-descriptive.\nThe first thing to point out is that (\u2217) is not equivalent to fragmentability, because \u03c91 is scattered (hence fragmentable), but does not have (\u2217). That \u03c91 does\nnot have (\u2217) is clear, either directly from Corollary 4.4, or from Theorem 3.1 and\n[38, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 3], which we mentioned in the Introduction. Any locally compact\nspace having (\u2217) necessarily has a countably tight 1-point compactification, but this\ncondition is not sufficient. Hereafter, all of our examples of locally compact spaces\nwithout (\u2217) have countably tight 1-point compactifications.\nNext, we consider trees. A tree (T, \u2264) is a partially ordered set with the property\nthat given any t \u2208 T , its set of predecessors {s \u2208 T : s \u2264 t} is well ordered. The\ntree order induces a natural locally compact, scattered interval topology. To render\nthis topology Hausdorff, we shall only consider trees T with the property that every\nnon-empty totally ordered subset of T has at most one minimal upper bound. An\nantichain is a subset of T , no two distinct elements of which are comparable. For\nfurther definitions and discussions about trees, and their role in renorming theory,\nwe refer the reader to [15, 16, 33, 34, 36, 39].\nIf P and Q are partially ordered sets then we say that a map \u03c1 : P \u2212\u2192 Q is\nstrictly increasing if \u03c1(x) < \u03c1(y) whenever x < y. If such a map exists then we\nwrite P 4 Q. In [33, Definition 5], the second-named author introduced a totally\nordered set Y to address the problem of when C0 (T )\u2217 admits a strictly convex dual\nnorm. We remark of Y that R 4 Y , Y \u03b1 4 Y for all \u03b1 < \u03c91 , where Y \u03b1 is ordered\nlexicographically, and finally Y contains no uncountable, well ordered subsets [33,\nSection 4]. By combining Theorem 3.1 with [34, Corollary 17], we obtain the next\nresult. See also [36, Theorem 26].\nTheorem 4.6. If T is a tree then the following are equivalent.\n(1) T is Gruenhage;\n(2) T has (\u2217);\n(3) C0 (T )\u2217 admits a strictly convex dual norm;\n20\n\n\f(4) T 4 Y .\nNote that the 1-point compactification T \u222a {\u221e} of a tree T is countably tight\nif and only if T admits no uncountable branches. Indeed, suppose that T admits\nno uncountable branches. Since each t \u2208 T admits a countable neighbourhood, the\nonly point we need to test is \u221e. If \u221e \u2208 A for some uncountable A \u2286 T , then by a\nstandard result of Ramsey theory, either A contains an uncountable totally ordered\nset or a countably infinite antichain E. Only the second possibility is valid, whence\n\u221e \u2208 E. The converse implication follows immediately from the fact that \u03c91 + 1 is\nnot countably tight. Thus we restrict our attention to trees with no uncountable\nbranches.\nGiven a partially ordered set P , we set\n\u03c3P = {A \u2286 P : A is well-ordered} .\nKurepa introduced this notion and proved the following fact: for all P , we have\n\u03c3P 64 P . On the other hand, it is straightforward to show that \u03c3R\u03b1 4 R\u03b1 \u00d7 {0, 1}\n[33, Proposition 23]. Moreover, it is known that T is descriptive if and only if\nT 4 Q [33, Theorem 4]. Therefore, we conclude that \u03c3Q and \u03c3R\u03b1 , \u03b1 < \u03c91 , are all\nGruenhage, non-descriptive spaces (see [34, p. 752] or [36, p. 405]). Instead, if we\nconsider any total order W satisfying Y 4 W , then \u03c3W 64 Y and so \u03c3W does not\nhave (\u2217). In addition, if W doesn't contain any uncountable well ordered subsets,\nthen \u03c3W is free of uncountable branches.\nThere is another type of tree without uncountable branches and without (\u2217). A\nsubset E of a tree is a final part if u \u2208 E whenever t \u2208 E and t \u2264 u. If E is a\nfinal part then we say that E is dense if every element of T is comparable with some\nelement of E, and T is called Baire if every countable intersection of dense final parts\n(which is itself a final part) is again dense. A subset E is called ever-branching if,\ngiven any t \u2208 E, there exist incomparable elements u, v \u2208 E satisfying t < u, v. If T\nadmits an ever-branching Baire subtree then C0 (T ) does not admit a G\u00e2teaux norm\n[15, Theorem 2.1]. Therefore, no such tree can have (\u2217). An ever-branching Baire\ntree without uncountable branches exists; see [39, Lemma 9.12] and [15, Proposition\n3.1]. Recall that a tree T is called Suslin if it contains no uncountable branches or\nantichains. The existence of Suslin trees is independent of ZFC; see, for example,\n[39, Section 6]. Every Suslin tree contains an ever-branching Baire subtree [39, p.\n246], so we conclude that no Suslin tree has (\u2217) either.\nIt is clear from Theorem 4.6 that in order to find examples of non-Gruenhage\nspaces with (\u2217), we must search further afield. A topological space X is said to be\nhereditarily separable (HS) if every subspace of X is separable. Clearly, the 1-point\ncompactification of a locally compact HS space is countably tight. These spaces\nare interesting for us because if K is compact, HS and non-metrisable, then it is\nautomatically non-descriptive. This fact is stated in [26, Proposition 4.2] but no\ndirect proof is given, so an argument is sketched here for completeness. If H is an\nisolated family of subsets of K then H must\nS be countable, because by hereditary\nseparability there is a countable subset of H which meets every member of H .\n21\n\n\fTherefore, if K is a descriptive compact HS space then it admits a countable network,\nwhence it is metrisable.\nSince we want compact, non-metrisable HS spaces that are also fragmentable, it\nis necessary to assume extra axioms. A space X is hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f (HL) if\nevery subspace of X is Lindel\u00f6f. If K is compact, fragmentable and HL then it\nis metrisable (cf. [20, Corollary 9]). Thus, we want HS spaces that are not HL;\nsuch objects are called S-spaces. We refer the reader to [31] for an introduction to\nS-spaces and also the related L-spaces. It is known that under MA + \u00acCH (where\nMA stands for Martin's axiom), there are no compact S-spaces (cf. [31, Theorem\n6.4.1]), and in fact it is consistent that there are no S-spaces at all (cf. [31, Theorem\n7.2.1]). Therefore, we must assume extra axioms if we are to find any animals in\nthis particular zoo.\nOur treatment of S-spaces proceeds as follows. First, we outline two approaches\nfor constructing S-spaces by refining existing topologies, and show that these yield\nGruenhage spaces. Second, we give an example under CH of a compact nonGruenhage space of cardinality \u05d01 with (\u2217) and show that, given a further mild\nassumption, no object of this kind can exist under MA + \u00acCH. Finally, we present\na third method of constructing S-spaces and show that no such space can have (\u2217).\nThe spaces developed using the first approach are sometimes called 'Kunen lines',\ndespite the fact that none of them are linearly ordered. Assuming CH, the authors\nof [18] develop a machine which accepts as input a first countable HS space (X, \u03c1)\nof cardinality \u05d01 , and generates a finer topology (X, \u03c4 ) which is locally compact,\nscattered, HS and non-Lindel\u00f6f. In applications, X is usually a subset of R and \u03c1 is\nthe induced metric topology.\nLater, this process was developed to ensure that (X, \u03c4 )n is HS for all n \u2208 N;\n[23, Section 7]. The resulting 1-point compactification K is known to Banach space\ntheorists as 'Kunen's compact space'. It is not explicitly stated in [23, Section\n7] that the resulting topology on X refines that of the real line, but the authors\nbelieve that it is meant to. If the topology is such a refinement then necessarily the\nEuclidean diameters of the Bk\u03b1 (which form the building blocks of neighbourhoods\nof points, see (8) on [23, p. 1124]) have to tend to 0 as k \u2192 \u221e. It can be checked\nthat this condition is also sufficient to produce a refinement. We note further that\nan alternative approach to [23, Section 7] is given in [7, Theorem 2.4], and there,\nthe fact that the original topology is refined is explicitly stated.\nOf course, it is clear that any refinement of a Gruenhage space is again Gruenhage, because we can use exactly the same open sets to separate points. Therefore,\nassuming the adjustment to the diameters of the Bk\u03b1 above, we have the following\nresult.\nProposition 4.7. The Kunen lines are Gruenhage spaces. In particular, C(K)\u2217\nadmits a strictly convex dual norm, the predual of which is necessarily G\u00e2teaux\nsmooth.\nThe second approach refines topologies as above, but this time using the axiom\nb = \u05d01 , where b is the minimal cardinality of a subset of NN which is unbounded\nwith respect to the ordering of eventual dominance. Under b = \u05d01 , it is shown in\n22\n\n\f[40, Theorem 2.5] that the topology of any set of reals of cardinality \u05d01 may be\nrefined to give a locally compact, scattered, non-Lindel\u00f6f topology which is HS in\nits finite powers.\nProposition 4.8. The spaces of Todor\u010devi\u0107 in [40, Theorem 2.5] are Gruenhage.\nBefore presenting our third approach to construct S-spaces, we give our example\nunder CH of a compact, scattered non-Gruenhage space with (\u2217). We shall adopt the\nsame basic approach as [18] and [23, Section 7], and use an idea from [1]. However,\nthe underlying motivation for the space should be compared, at a distance, to the\nsplit interval, rather than the real line.\nIn fact, we construct a locally compact, scattered non-Gruenhage space with a\nG\u03b4 -diagonal. The 1-point compactification of this space has (\u2217). For our example,\nwe shall make use of the following observation about Gruenhage spaces of cardinality\nno larger than the continuum.\nProposition 4.9. [36, Proposition 2] Let X be a topological space with card X \u2264 c.\nThen X is Gruenhage if and only if there is a sequence (Un )\u221e\nn=1 of open subsets of\nX with the property that if x, y \u2208 X, then {x, y} \u2229 Un is a singleton for some n.\nIn that which follows, diam denotes Euclidean diameter.\nExample 4.10. (CH) There exists a locally compact, scattered, first countable\nHausdorff, non-Gruenhage space with a G\u03b4 -diagonal.\nProof. Let (x\u03b1 )\u03b1<\u03c91 be a set of distinct points in [0, 1]. Define Y\u03b1 = {x\u03be : \u03be < \u03b1}\nand X\u03b1 = Y\u03b1 \u00d7 {\u00b11} for \u03b1 \u2264 \u03c91 , with Y = Y\u03c91 and X = X\u03c91 . Assuming CH, let\n(A\u03b1 )\u03b1<\u03c91 be an enumeration of all the countable subsets of Y . Let t : X \u2212\u2192 X\nbe the map t(x, i) = (x, \u2212i), and let q : X \u2212\u2192 Y be the natural projection. We\nobtain our topology on X by building increasing topologies \u03c4\u03b1 on the X\u03b1 , \u03b1 < \u03c91 ,\nby transfinite induction. The points (x\u03b1 , i), i = \u00b11, will have a countable base of\ncompact open neighbourhoods U(x\u03b1 , i, n), n \u2208 N, such that\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\nif \u03b2 < \u03b1 then X\u03b2 is open in \u03c4\u03b1 and \u03c4\u03b2 is the topology on X\u03b2 induced by \u03c4\u03b1 ;\nU(x\u03b1 , i, n) \\ {(x\u03b1 , i)} \u2286 X\u03b1 ;\ndiam (q(U(x\u03b1 , i, n))) < 2\u2212n ;\nU(x\u03b1 , \u2212i, n) = t(U(x\u03b1 , i, n));\nq\u21beU (x\u03b1 ,i,n) is injective;\nR\nif \u03be \u2264 \u03b1, A\u03be \u2286 Y\u03b1 and x\u03b1 \u2208 A\u03be , then\nU(x\u03b1 , i, n) \u2229 (A\u03be \u00d7 {\u2212i})\nis non-empty for every n.\n\nTo take care of limit stages \u03b1, we set\n\u03c4\u03b1 = {U \u2286 X\u03b1 : U \u2229 X\u03b2 \u2208 \u03c4\u03b2 for all \u03b2 < \u03b1} .\nNow assume that \u03c4\u03b1 has been found. We construct \u03c4\u03b1+1 by constructing neighbourhoods U(x\u03b1 , i, n), n \u2208 N, of the points (x\u03b1 , i), i = \u00b11.\n23\n\n\fR\n\nIf x\u03b1 \u2208\n/ Y\u03b1 then set U(x\u03b1 , i, n) = {(x\u03b1 , i)} for i = \u00b11 and n \u2208 N. Note that as Y\nis a separable subset of R, this can happen for only countably many \u03b1. Now assume\nR\nthat x\u03b1 \u2208 Y\u03b1 . Define\nn\no\nR\nF\u03b1 = \u03be \u2264 \u03b1 : A\u03be \u2286 Y\u03b1 and x\u03b1 \u2208 A\u03be .\n\nSince F\u03b1 is at most countable, we can find an injective sequence (sn )\u221e\nn=1 \u2286 Y\u03b1\nconverging to x\u03b1 , such that\n(i) diam ({sm : m \u2265 n}) < 2\u2212n for each n\n(ii) {n \u2208 N : sn \u2208 A\u03be } is infinite whenever \u03be \u2208 F\u03b1 .\nBy considering (3) applied to \u03b2 < \u03b1, and (i) above, for every n we can find kn such\nthat\n(iii) q(U(sn , \u22121, kn )) \u2229 q(U(sm , \u22121, km)) = \u2205\nwhenever n 6= m, and\n\u0001\nS\n(iv) diam (q m\u2265n U(sm , \u22121, km ) ) < 2\u2212n\nfor every n. Finally, define\n[\nU(x\u03b1 , i, n) = {(x\u03b1 , i)} \u222a\nU(sm , \u2212i, km ).\nm\u2265n\n\nThese neighbourhoods are compact and open. Extend \u03c4\u03b1 to \u03c4\u03b1+1 in the obvious way.\nIt is clear that we have (1) and (2), and then \u03c4\u03b1+1 is locally compact. (3) follows\nfrom (iv) above. That \u03c4\u03b1+1 is Hausdorff follows by inductive hypothesis, (3), and\nthe fact that U(x\u03b1 , 1, n) \u2229 U(x\u03b1 , \u22121, m) = \u2205. (4) and (5) follow from the inductive\nhypothesis, the definition of U(x\u03b1 , i, n) and (iii) above. To see (6), note that\n{sm : m \u2265 n} \u00d7 {\u2212i} \u2286 U(x\u03b1 , i, n) \u2229 (A\u03be \u00d7 {\u2212i})\nso (6) now follows from (ii) above. This completes the induction. The topology on\nX is given by\n{U \u2286 X : U \u2229 X\u03b1 \u2208 \u03c4\u03b1 for all \u03b1 < \u03c91 }\nWe show that X is scattered. If E \u2286 X is non-empty then let \u03b1 be minimal, such\nthat E \u2229 {(x\u03b1 , \u00b11)} is non-empty. If (x\u03b1 , i) \u2208 E then by (1) and (2), we have that\nU = X\u03b1 \u222a {(x\u03b1 , i)} is open, and E \u2229 U = {(x\u03b1 , i)}.\nNow we show that X has a G\u03b4 -diagonal. Set\nGn = {U(x, i, n) : (x, i) \u2208 X} .\nLet (x, i), (y, j) \u2208 X. If x 6= y then pick n such that |x \u2212 y| \u2265 2\u2212n . We cannot have\n(y, j) \u2208 st((x, i), n) because if so we would have (x, i), (y, j) \u2208 U(z, k, n) for some\n(z, k), giving\n|x \u2212 y| \u2264 diam (q(U(z, k, n))) < 2\u2212n\nby (3). If x = y and i 6= j then by (5), we cannot have (x, i), (y, j) \u2208 U(z, k, n) for\nany (z, k) or n. Whatever the case,\n\u221e\n\\\n\nst((x, i), n) = {(x, i)}.\n\nn=1\n\n24\n\n\fThis shows that (Gn )\u221e\nn=1 is a G\u03b4 -diagonal sequence.\nFinally, we prove that X is not Gruenhage. Bearing in mind Proposition 4.9, we\nsuppose for a contradiction that there exists a sequence of open subsets (Vn )\u221e\nn=1 ,\nwith the property that given (x, i), (y, j) \u2208 X, we can find n such that\n{(x, i), (y, j)} \u2229 Vn\nis a singleton. Define\nJn,i = {x \u2208 Y : (x, i) \u2208 Vn and (x, \u2212i) \u2208\n/ Vn } .\nS\nBy assumption, Y = n,i Jn,i , so there exist n and i such that J = Jn,i is uncountable. Remembering that R is HS, we can find a countable subset A\u03be such that\nR\nA\u03be \u2286 J \u2286 A\u03be . Because J is uncountable, we can pick \u03b1 \u2265 \u03be such that A\u03be \u2286 Y\u03b1\nR\nand x\u03b1 \u2208 J \u2286 A\u03be . Since x\u03b1 \u2208 J, we have (x\u03b1 , i) \u2208 Vn , so take m such that\nU(x\u03b1 , i, m) \u2286 Vn . From (6), we know that\nU(x\u03b1 , i, m) \u2229 (A\u03be \u00d7 {\u2212i}) \u2286 Vn \u2229 (J \u00d7 {\u2212i})\nis non-empty. However, this violates the definition of J. This contradiction establishes that X is not Gruenhage.\n\u0003\nTogether with Theorem 3.1, this example shows that if C(K)\u2217 admits a strictly\nconvex dual norm then K is not necessarily Gruenhage. This gives a consistent\nnegative solution to [34, Problem 14] and [36, Problem 4].\nWe remark that the example above need not be HS. However, it can easily be\nmade to be HS by changing (ii) above to read\n(ii) {n \u2208 N : s2n , s2n+1 \u2208 A\u03be } is infinite whenever \u03be \u2208 F\u03b1\nand setting\n[\nU(x\u03b1 , i, n) = {(x\u03b1 , i)} \u222a\nU(sm , (\u22121)m i, km ).\nm\u2265n\n\nTo see that this makes X HS, we let E \u2286 X and set Ei = {x \u2208 Y : (x, i) \u2208 E},\nR\ni = \u00b11. Then take \u03bei < \u03c91 such that A\u03bei \u2286 Ei \u2286 A\u03bei and choose \u03b1 \u2265 \u03be1 , \u03be\u22121 large\nenough to satisfy A\u03be1 \u222a A\u03be\u22121 \u2286 Y\u03b1 . It can now be verified that E is in the closure of\nE \u2229 X\u03b1 .\nThere is no hope of constructing something like Example 4.10 in ZFC. A space X\nis called locally countable if every point of X admits a countable neighbourhood. For\nexample, trees of height at most \u03c91 and 'thin-tall' locally compact spaces are locally\ncountable. It is straightforward to see that a locally compact, locally countable\nspace must be scattered.\nProposition 4.11 (MA + \u00acCH). Suppose that L is a locally compact, locally countable space with (\u2217) and card L < c. Then L is \u03c3-discrete.\nProof. This follows immediately from Corollary 4.4 and [3, Theorem 2.1].\n\n\u0003\n\nIt is not possible use stronger axioms to extend Proposition 4.11 to include spaces\nof cardinality c: the tree \u03c3Q is locally compact, locally countable and Gruenhage,\nbut is not \u03c3-discrete.\n25\n\n\fWe end this section by presenting our third class of S-spaces. We shall call a\nregular, uncountable topological space X an O-space if every open subset of X\nis either countable or co-countable. Ostaszewski constructed a locally compact,\nscattered O-space using the clubsuit axiom \u2663 [27, p. 506]. It is known that \u2663 is\nindependent of CH and that \u2663 + CH is equivalent to Jensen's axiom \u2666 (see [32] and\n[27, p. 506], respectively). It is possible to obtain O-spaces by assuming principles\nstrictly weaker than \u2663 [19, Theorem 2.1]. Unlike the previous constructions, these\nspaces are built from scratch, rather than by refining an initial space.\nEvery O-space contains an S-subspace. Indeed, if X is an O-space then notice\nthat at most one point of X can fail to have a countable open neighbourhood. Thus\nwe can construct by induction an uncountable subspace Y = {x\u03b1 : \u03b1 < \u03c91 } such\nthat {x\u03be : \u03be < \u03b1} is open in Y for every \u03b1 < \u03c91 . Thus Y is not Lindel\u00f6f. If, for a\ncontradiction, we suppose that Z \u2286 Y is not separable, then by another induction\nwe can construct an uncountable, relatively discrete subspace of Y . However, this\ncannot exist by the O-space property. Therefore Y is an S-space. We can argue\nsimilarly to establish that every locally compact O-space has a countably tight 1point compactification.\nProposition 4.12. If X is an O-space then it does not have (\u2217).\nProof. Suppose that (Un )\u221e\nn=1 is a (\u2217)-sequence for X, with Cn =\nSet\nJ = {n \u2208 I : Cn is uncountable} .\n\nS\n\nUn for each n.\n\nIf n \u2208 J then X \\ Cn is countable, so\n[\n[\nE=\n(X \\ Cn ) \u222a\nCn\nn\u2208J\n\nn\u2208N\\J\n\nis also countable. If we let A = X \\ E then we see that A \u2286 Cn for all n \u2208 J, and\nA \u2229 Cn is empty whenever n \u2208\n/ J. For x \u2208 A and n \u2208 J, define\n[\nst(x, n) =\n{U \u2208 Un : x \u2208 U} .\nSince (Un )\u221e\nn=1 is assumed to be a (\u2217)-sequence for X, we have\n\\\n{x} = A \u2229\nst(x, n)\nn\u2208J\n\nfor all x \u2208 A, i.e. (Un )\u221e\nn=1 induces a G\u03b4 -diagonal sequence on A. Given this, it\nfollows that for each x \u2208 A, there exists some nx \u2208 J such that st(x, nx ) is countable.\nIndeed, otherwise,\n[\nE\u222a\n(X \\ st(x, n))\nn\u2208J\n\nis countable, giving\n\n{x} = A \u2229\n\n\\\n\nn\u2208J\n\n26\n\nst(x, n)\n\n\funcountable. Since A is uncountable, there exists n, which we fix from now on,\nsuch that B = {x \u2208 A : nx = n} is uncountable. Take an enumeration (x\u03b1 )\u03b1<\u03c91 of\ndistinct points in B. We find \u03b10 < \u03b11 < \u03b12 < . . . < \u03c91 such that\n[\n/\nst(x\u03b1\u03be , n)\nx\u03b1\u03b7 \u2208\n\u03be<\u03b7\n\nfor all \u03b7 < \u03c91 . Observe that by the symmetry\n/\n\b of the sets st(x, n), we have x\u03b1\u03be \u2208\nst(x\u03b1\u03b7 , n) whenever \u03be 6= \u03b7. Therefore C = x\u03b1\u03be : \u03be < \u03c91 is a relatively discrete\nsubspace, which is not permitted by the O-space property.\n\u0003\nExample 4.13. Ostaszewski's space [27, p. 506] is a locally compact, scattered HS\nO-space. Therefore, it does not have (\u2217).\nBy refining Ostaszewski's construction, it is possible to use \u2663 to build a compact,\nscattered non-metrisable space K, such that K n is HS for all n [14, Theorem 4.36].\nMoreover, it can be checked that this K is, in addition, an O-space. Therefore,\nunlike C(K)\u2217 , the space C(K)\u2217 admits no strictly convex dual norm.\nWe make a remark about this C(K): the authors don't know if it admits a G\u00e2teaux\nnorm. Since K is separable, C(K) admits a bounded linear, injective map into c0 .\nThe authors don't know of any example of an Asplund space with an injective map\ninto a c0 (\u0393), which does not admit a G\u00e2teaux norm.\n5. Problems\nTo finish, we present a number of related, unresolved problems. The first problem\nstems from Theorem 3.1.\nProblem 5.1. If K has (\u2217) and is not scattered, then does C(K)\u2217 admit a strictly\nconvex dual norm?\nIn fact, we don't even know if C(L \u222a {\u221e})\u2217 admits a strictly convex norm whenever L is a locally compact space having a G\u03b4 -diagonal. The next problem is\nprompted by Example 4.10.\nProblem 5.2. Is there in ZFC an example of a non-Gruenhage compact space with\n(\u2217)?\nProposition 4.5 suggests the next problem.\nProblem 5.3. If K has (\u2217) and is not scattered, and \u03c0 : K \u2212\u2192 M is a continuous,\nsurjective map, then does M have (\u2217)? More generally, if a topological space X has\n(\u2217) and f : X \u2212\u2192 Y is a perfect, surjective map, does Y have (\u2217)?\nIt is known that the answer to Problem 5.3 is positive in the Gruenhage case,\nincluding the more general perfect map assertion [34, Theorem 23]. It is also known\nthat G\u03b4 -diagonals are not preserved under perfect images. In [4, Example 2], an\nexample is given of a locally compact scattered space L having a G\u03b4 -diagonal, and a\nperfect surjective map f : L \u2212\u2192 M, where the diagonal of M is not a G\u03b4 . However,\nL(2) is empty, and the same will apply to any perfect image of L, so all such images\n27\n\n\fare \u03c3-discrete and therefore have (\u2217). If Problem 5.1 has a positive solution then so\nwill the first part of Problem 5.3, simply by copying the proof of Proposition 4.5.\nFor our last problem, we refer the reader to the end of Section 4.\nProblem 5.4. Does C(K) admit a G\u00e2teaux norm, where K is the O-space of [27,\np. 506] or [14, Theorem 4.36]?\nReferences\n1. K. Alster, D. Burke and S.
