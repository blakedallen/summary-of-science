The pioneer work of Morris and Thorne [1]\nhas shown that macroscopic wormholes may not only exist but may actually be traversable\nby humanoid travelers. Wormholes can only be held open by the use of \"exotic\" matter.\nSuch matter violates the weak energy condition.\nWhile wormholes are predictions of Einstein's theory, quantum field theory places\nsevere restrictions on the existence of traversable wormholes [2, 3, 4, 5]. In fact, Ford\nand Roman [4, 5] have shown that the wormholes discussed in Ref. [1] could not exist\non a macroscopic scale. The wormholes in Refs. [6] and [7] could in principle exist, but\nthey are subject to extreme fine-tuning. Fine-tuning is also required in Refs. [8] and\n[9], where a suitable extension of the quantum inequalities of Ford and Roman is used\nto show that Morris-Thorne wormholes can be compatible with quantum field theory by\nstriking a balance between the size of the exotic region and the concomitant fine-tuning\nof the metric coefficients. Ref. [10] continues the theme by showing that a relatively small\nmodification of the charged wormhole model of Kim and Lee [11, 12] can make such a\nwormhole compatible with quantum field theory.\nA powerful method for describing or mathematically constructing a type of spherically\nsymmetric wormholes from black-hole spacetimes was proposed by Visser [13]. Known as\nthin-shell wormholes, they are constructed by the so-called cut-and-paste technique since\n\u2217\n\nkuhfitti@msoe.edu\n\n1\n\n\ftheir construction requires grafting two black-hole spacetimes together. The thin shell is\nactually the junction surface.\nIt is proposed in this paper that under fairly general conditions a thin-shell wormhole\ncan be compatible with quantum field theory.\n\n2\n\nTraversable wormholes\n\nThe spacetime geometry of a static, spherically symmetric Lorentzian wormhole can be\ndescribed by the metric (using units in which c = G = 1)\nds2 = \u2212e2\u03a6(r) dt2 +\n\ndr 2\n+ r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ),\n1 \u2212 b(r)/r\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a6(r) and b(r) have continuous derivatives. It is usually assumed that \u03a6(r) \u2192 0\nand b(r)/r \u2192 0 as r \u2192 \u221e, i.e., the spacetime is asymptotically flat. (This condition\nwill be automatically satisfied due to some later conditions.) The function \u03a6(r) is called\nthe redshift function, which must be everywhere finite to prevent an event horizon. We\nare also going to require that \u03a6\u2032 (r) > 0. The function b(r) is called the shape function\nsince it determines the spatial shape of the wormhole when viewed, for example, in an\nembedding diagram. The minimum radius r = r0 is called the throat of the wormhole,\nwhere b(r0 ) = r0 . Finally, b\u2032 (r0 ) \u2264 1, referred to as the flare-out condition in Ref. [1].\nNext, let us recall that the Einstein field equations G\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 = 8\u03c0T\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 imply that in the\northonormal frame, the components of the stress-energy tensor are proportional to the\ncomponents of the Einstein tensor. The only nonzero components are Tt\u0302t\u0302 = \u03c1, Tr\u0302r\u0302 = p,\nand T\u03b8\u0302\u03b8\u0302 = T\u03c6\u0302\u03c6\u0302 = pr , where \u03c1 is the energy density, p the radial pressure, and pr the lateral\npressure.\nTo hold a wormhole open, the weak energy condition (WEC) must be violated. The\nWEC states that the stress-energy tensor T\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 \u03bc\u03b1\u0302 \u03bc\u03b2\u0302 must obey\nT\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 \u03bc\u03b1\u0302 \u03bc\u03b2\u0302 \u2265 0\n\n(2)\n\nfor all time-like vectors and, by continuity, all null vectors. Using the radial outgoing null\nvector \u03bc\u03b1\u0302 = (1, 1, 0, 0), the condition becomes Tt\u0302t\u0302 + Tr\u0302r\u0302 = \u03c1 + p \u2265 0. So if the WEC is\nviolated, then \u03c1 + p < 0. Matter that violates the WEC is referred to as \"exotic.\"\nFrom the Einstein field equations, the components of the stress-energy tensor turn out\nto be [1, 13]\n1 b\u2032\n,\n(3)\n\u03c1=\n8\u03c0 r 2\n\u0014\n\u0013 \u0015\n\u0012\n1\nb\nb \u03a6\u2032\np=\n\u2212 3 +2 1\u2212\n,\n(4)\n8\u03c0\nr\nr r\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012 \u0013\u2032 \u0012\n\u0013\n1\nb\n1 b\n1\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n1\u2212\n\u03c6 +\u03a6 \u03a6 +\n\u2212\n\u03a6 +\n.\n(5)\npt =\n8\u03c0\nr\nr\n2 r\nr\n\nOf particular interest in this paper is the thin-shell wormhole first proposed by Visser\n[13]. The theoretical construction is also referred to as the cut-and-paste technique and\n2\n\n\fis now considered standard. While it is possible to start with two copies of a generic\ngeometry, Visser initially confined the construction to Schwarzschild spacetimes. In similar manner, we will take two copies of an asymptotically flat black-hole spacetime with\n(outer) event horizon r = rh and remove from each the four-dimensional region\n\u03a9\u00b1 = {r \u2264 a|a > rh }.\nThe construction proceeds by identifying (in the sense of topology) the time-like hypersurfaces\n\u2202\u03a9\u00b1 = {r = a|a > rh }.\nThe resulting manifold is geodesically complete and consists of two asymptotically flat\nregions connected by a throat, thereby forming a traversable Lorentzian wormhole.\nThe reason for our interest in thin-shell wormholes is the following key property: all\nthe exotic matter is confined to an infinitely thin shell. The property is, of course, an\nidealization: we assume that the shell is extremely thin compared to the radius of the\nthroat.\n\n3\n\nThe quantum inequalities\n\nIn this section we briefly discuss the quantum inequalities due to Ford and Roman [5],\nslightly extended in [8, 9]. These inequalities constrain the magnitude and time duration of\nnegative energy and, as a consequence, place severe restrictions on Lorentzian wormholes.\nThe starting point is an inertial Minkowski spacetime without boundaries. So if u\u03bd is the\ntangent vector to a timelike geodesic, then hT\u03bc\u03bd u\u03bc u\u03bd i is the expectation value of the local\nenergy density in the observer's frame of reference. So if \u03c4 is the observer's proper time\nand \u03c40 the duration of the sampling time, then\nZ\n\u03c40 \u221e hT\u03bc\u03bd u\u03bc u\u03bd id\u03c4\n3\n\u2265\u2212\n.\n(6)\n2\n2\n\u03c0 \u2212\u221e \u03c4 + \u03c40\n32\u03c0 2 \u03c404\nAccording to Ref. [5], the energy density is sampled in a time interval of duration \u03c40\nwhich is centered around an arbitrary point on the observer's worldline so chosen that\n\u03c4 = 0 at this point. The inequality is valid in curved spacetime as long as \u03c40 is small compared to the local proper radii of curvature. Applied to spherically symmetric traversable\nwormholes in Ref. [1], it was found that none were able to meet this condition, i.e., the\nthroat sizes could only be slightly larger than Planck length.\nFor the purpose of discussing wormholes, more convenient forms of the above quantum\ninequality can be obtained. To do so, we need the following length scales modeled after\nthe length scales in Ref. [5], introduced in Ref. [8]:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nb(r)\n\u03a6\u2032 (r)\n1\nrm \u2261 min r, \u2032\n,\n,\n.\n(7)\nb (r) |\u03a6\u2032 (r)| \u03a6\u2032\u2032 (r)\nThe reason is that the components of the Riemann curvature tensor can be expressed in\nthe following form:\n3\n\n\fRr\u0302t\u0302r\u0302t\u0302\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nb(r)\n= 1\u2212\nr\n\n1\n\u03a6\u2032 (r) 1\n\u03a6\u2032\u2032 (r) \u03a6\u2032 (r)\n\nb(r)\n\u2212\n2r\n\n1\n1 b(r)\n\u03a6\u2032 (r) b\u2032 (r)\n\n\u2212\n\n1\nr \u03a6\u20321(r)\n\n!\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nb(r)\n+ 1\u2212\n\u0010\n\u00112 , (8)\nr\n1\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nb(r)\n1\n,\nR\u03b8\u0302t\u0302\u03b8\u0302t\u0302 = R\u03c6\u0302t\u0302\u03c6\u0302t\u0302 = 1 \u2212\nr\nr \u03a6\u20321(r)\n!\nb(r)\n1\n1\nR\u03b8\u0302r\u0302\u03b8\u0302r\u0302 = R\u03c6\u0302r\u0302\u03c6\u0302r\u0302 =\n\u2212 2 ,\n2r\nr\nr b(r)\n\u2032\n\n\u03a6\u2032 (r)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nb (r)\n\nand\n\n1 b(r)\n.\n(11)\nr2 r\nThe purpose of these length scales is to obtain an upper bound for Rmax , the maximum\ncurvature: observe that the largest value of (1 \u2212 b(r))/r and of b(r)/r is unity. So disre2\ngarding the coefficient 1/2, we conclude that Rmax \u2264 1/rm\n.

[5] that the static frame be replaced by\na \"boosted frame,\" i.e., by Lorentz transforming to a frame of a radially moving geodesic\nobserver moving with velocity v relative to the static frame. In this boosted frame the\nenergy density \u03c1\u2032 may be negative, so that inequality (6) can be applied.

It is stated in Ref.

It was extended in\nRef. [8]. The purpose of the extended inequality (18) is to include the region around the\nthroat, instead of just the throat itself. [See Ref. [8] for details.] Also discussed in [8] is\na second inequality that omits both v 2 and \u03b3. The reason is that, according to Ref. [2],\nthe boosted frame can be replaced by a static observer. In this frame, rm is then replaced\nby lm , the proper distance.

This constraint is amply satisfied for a thin-shell wormhole where\nthe throat surface is theoretically infinitely thin. So we are dealing with an extremely\nsmall interval, as a result of which \u03c1 + p is approximately constant on this interval, i.e.,\n5\n\n\f\u03c1 + p = \u2212\u03b7 (\u03b7 > 0). To calculate the volume, we need an appropriate volume measure:\n\u221a\ndV = 4\u03c0r 2 dr or g dr d\u03b8 d\u03c6. So if the shell containing the exotic matter extends from\nr = r0 to r = r1 (on both sides of the throat), we get\nZ r1\nZ r1\n8\u03c0\u03b7 3\n(r \u2212 r03 ).\n(21)\n(\u2212\u03b7)(4\u03c0r 2 dr) = \u2212\n(\u2212\u03b7)dV = 2\n2\n3 1\nr0\nr0\nThis volume can be made arbitrarily small by choosing r1 sufficiently close to r0 . So if the\nshell is infinitely thin, then the amount of exotic matter (by volume) becomes infinitely\nsmall. It is noted in Refs. [2, 3, 8], however, that the amount of exotic matter cannot\nbe arbitrarily small, but as already discussed in Sec. 2, an infinitely thin shell is an\nidealization: the amount of exotic matter could be relatively small but not arbitrarily\nsmall.\nAs noted earlier, having the exotic matter confined to a very thin band is a necessary\ncondition for the existence of a traversable wormhole, but the condition is not sufficient\nfor the sought-after compatibility with quantum field theory. That is the topic of the next\nsection, which deals with wormholes in general, not just the thin-shell type.\n\n5\n\nA volume integral\n\nMeasuring the amount of exotic matter by means of a volume integral involving b and \u03a6\nwas first proposed by Visser et al. [14] and continued by Nandi et al. [15]. Using Eqs.\n(3) and (4), it is readily checked that\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0014 \u0012 2\u03a6 \u0013\u0015\u2032\nb\ne\n1\n.\n(22)\n1\u2212\nln\n\u03c1+p=\n8\u03c0r\nr\n1 \u2212 b/r\nUsing the volume measure dV = 8\u03c0r 2dr from the previous section, Eq. (22) becomes\n\u0014 \u0012 2\u03a6 \u0013\u0015\u2032\ne\n\u03c1 + p = (r \u2212 b) ln\n.\n(23)\n1 \u2212 b/r\nIntegrating by parts, we then obtain for the volume\n\u0012 2\u03a6 \u0013 \u221e Z \u221e\n\u0014 \u0012 2\u03a6 \u0013\u0015\nI\ne\ne\n\u2032\n(\u03c1 + p)dV = (r \u2212 b)ln\n\u2212\n(1 \u2212 b ) ln\ndr.\n1 \u2212 b/r r0\n1 \u2212 b/r\nr0\n\n(24)\n\nRegarding the boundary term, observe that since b(r0 ) = r0 ,\n2\u03a6\n\nlim (r \u2212 b)ln e\n\nr\u2192r0\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u00131\u2212b/r\n\u0012\nb\nb\n= 0 \u2212 lim r ln 1 \u2212\n= \u2212r0 ln1 = 0.\n\u2212 (r \u2212 b) ln 1 \u2212\nr\u2192r0\nr\nr\n\nIt is noted in Ref. [15] that the boundary term also vanishes as r \u2192 \u221e provided that\n\u03a6(r) \u223c O(r \u22122 ) and b(r) \u223c O(r \u22121 ), which can likewise be easily confirmed.\nThe vanishing boundary term leaves\n\u0014 \u0012 2\u03a6 \u0013\u0015\nI\nZ \u221e\ne\n\u2032\ndr.\n(25)\n(\u03c1 + p)dV = \u2212\n(1 \u2212 b ) ln\n1 \u2212 b/r\nr0\n6\n\n\fIt is easy to show that this integral is well behaved near r = r0 . For the upper limit, the\nconditions \u03a6(r) \u223c O(r \u22122 ) and b(r) \u223c O(r \u22121 ) carry the day.\nNow recall from the previous section that the interval [r0 , r1 ] containing the exotic\nmatter can be made as small as desired. The only way to obtain a small value for the\nintegral in Eq. (25) is by letting b\u2032 be close to unity. For convenience, let us now restate\ninequality (20):\nlm\n\u2264\nr\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u2032\nb(r)/r \u2212 b (r) \u2212 2r\u03a6\u2032 (r) (1 \u2212 b(r)/r)\n\n\u00131/4\n\n1\nf\n\n\u0012 \u00131/2\nlp\n.\nr\n\n(26)\n\nObserve that at the throat, where b(r0 ) = r0 , the inequality is trivially satisfied whenever\nb\u2032 (r0 ) = 1. Moving away from the throat, the denominator must still be 0 or close to 0,\ncalling for an appropriate adjustment of the redshift function \u03a6(r). Such an adjustment\nis in principle possible for the following reason: it is shown in Ref. [8] that, for any of the\ntypical shape functions, b(r)/r\u2212b\u2032 (r) > 0; at the same time, \u03a6\u2032 (r) > 0, an assumption that\nwas brought out earlier. (The only other assumptions made are that \u03a6(r) remains finite\nand that \u03a6(r) \u223c O(r \u22122 ), which have no direct bearing on the problem.) So inequality\n(26) can be satisfied in the neighborhood of the throat, provided that b\u2032 (r) remains close\nto 1 (while gradually declining). But the small value of the left side of Eq. (25) forces\nb\u2032 to be close to 1 near the throat. The thin-shell wormhole is therefore compatible with\nquantum field theory under fairly general conditions.\n\n6\n\nThe volume integral theorem\n\nThe volume integral for determining the amount of exotic matter has been extended to\n[15]\nZ 2\u03c0 Z \u03c0 Z \u221e\n\u221a\n\u03a9=\n(\u03c1 + p) \u2212g4 dr d\u03b8 d\u03c6.\n(27)\n0\n\n0\n\nr0\n\nApplied to an infinitely thin shell of radius a, it is sometimes assumed that\n\u03c1(r) = \u03b4(r \u2212 a)\u03c3(a),\n\nwhere \u03c3(a) is the energy density of the thin shell and \u03b4 is the Dirac delta function [16].\nUsing the orthonormal basis et\u0302 = [f (r)]\u22121/2 et , er\u0302 = [f (r)]1/2 er , e\u03b8\u0302 = (r 2 )\u22121/2 e\u03b8 , and\n\u221a\ne\u03c6\u0302 = [r 2 sin2 \u03b8]\u22121/2 e\u03c6 , we get \u2212g4 = r 2 sin \u03b8. Since an infinitely thin shell does not exert\nany radial pressure, we now have\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n2\n\n\u03b4(r \u2212 a)\u03c3(a)r sin \u03b8 dr d\u03b8 d\u03c6 =\n\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\n0\n\n\u03c3(a)r 2 |r=a sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6\n= 4\u03c0\u03c3(a)a2 . (28)\n\nFor a Schwarzschild spacetime, where\n1\n\u03c3(a) = \u2212\n2\u03c0a\n7\n\nr\n\n1\u2212\n\n2M\n,\na\n\n\fthe result is\n\nr\n\n2M\n;\na\nmoreover, for large a, \u03a9 \u2248 \u22122a. This can lead to a huge amount of exotic matter since\nwe are using geometrized units. For example, if M = 0.1 m, and a = 1 m, then \u03a9 = \u22121.8\nm, which exceeds the mass of Jupiter in absolute value even though the shell is infinitely\nthin. At the opposite end, \u03a9 can be made arbitrarily small by choosing a sufficiently close\nto the event horizon r = 2M. The result is a black-hole mimicker [17], which may be\nindistinguishable from a black hole at a distance. So while the use of the delta function is\nmathematically correct, when applied to an infinitely thin shell, this use does not appear\nto be appropriate for expressing the density \u03c1 of the shell. The outcome also conflicts\nwith the results in the previous section.\nTo see the reason for the discrepancy between the two models, let us use the prelimit\nform of the delta function, i.e.,\n(\n1\n, a\u2264r \u2264a+\u01eb\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c3(a) \u01eb\n(29)\n0, otherwise\n\u03a9 = \u22122a\n\n1\u2212\n\nand then take the limit as \u01eb \u2192 0. Now Eq. (27) becomes\n\u03a9 = lim\u01eb\u21920\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\na+\u01eb\n\n1\u221a\n\u2212g4 dr d\u03b8 d\u03c6\n\u03c3(a)\n\u01eb\na\nZ 2\u03c0 Z \u03c0 Z a+\u01eb\n1\n= lim\u01eb\u21920\n\u03c3(a) r 2 sin \u03b8 drd\u03b8 d\u03c6\n\u01eb\n0\n0\na\n11\n= lim\u01eb\u21920 4\u03c0\u03c3(a) [(a + \u01eb)3 \u2212 a3 ] = 4\u03c0\u03c3(a)a2\n\u01eb3\n\nZ\n\nby L'Hospital's rule, in agreement with Eq. (28).\nThe use of the prelimit form now allows a comparison between the two models: as\n\u01eb \u2192 0, the density increases beyond any bound, i.e., \u03c1(r) \u2192 \u221e by Eq. (29). Since we do\nnot normally talk about the \"value\" of the delta function but only about the values of\nintegrals involving the delta function, the assumption that \u03c1(r) \u2192 \u221e is not inconsistent\nwith the usual formalism, but which is the preferred model? It was noted earlier that\n\u03c1(r) is approximately constant on a small interval. So from a physical standpoint, \u03c1(r)\nmay be large, but it is definitely finite, and this implies that as \u01eb \u2192 0, the area under the\ngraph goes to zero, so that \u03a9 \u2192 0, as in the previous section. By contrast, the use of the\ndelta function leads to the unjustifiable assumption that the area remains fixed at \u03c3(a) * 1\nfor every interval [a, a + \u01eb], no matter how small.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.S.
