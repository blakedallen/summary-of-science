The charge carriers have a\nhigh mobility due to their low effective mass and it is\npossible to achieve a high level of n- and p-type dopant\nactivation.1,2 The designers of microelectronics initially\nfocused on Si instead of Ge because Ge lacks a native oxide that can be used as a dielectric. Fortunately this limitation can be overcome by several techniques that have\nbeen developed within the last decade: a thin Si overlayer can be grown over the Ge so that SiO2 can be used\nas the dielectric,3 a Ge-oxynitride dielectric layer can be\ngrown over the Ge,4 or a high-\u03ba dielectric crystal, such\nas ZrO2 , can be used in the device.5 These techniques allow for the development of Si/Ge heterostructure devices\nsuch as metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors,\nMOSFETs. The heterostructure MOSFET is primarily\nSi so existing fabrication technology can be used, but Ge\nis included as a buried channel between the source and\ndrain to allow for high-speed conductivity.6\u20139\nBefore Ge can become an industrially important material, it must be possible to introduce and control a variety\nof dopant species in the crystal.10 Due to the initial challenge of finding a suitable dielectric material, there has\nbeen much less effort in understanding Ge as compared to\nSi. Subsequently much less is known about the control of\ndopants in Ge than in Si. There exists a close relationship\nbetween impurity diffusion and self-diffusion; therefore, it\nis fundamentally important to understand self-diffusion\n\nto understand the control of impurity atoms.\nFollowing Refs. [11] and [12], the self-diffusion coefficient D (T ) is written as a sum of the vacancy (v), interstitial (i), and direct-exchange (ex) diffusion mechanisms,\nD (T ) = fv (T ) Cveq (T ) Dv (T ) +\n+ fi (T ) Cieq (T ) Di (T ) + Dex (T ) (1)\nwhere f\u03b7 (T ) are correlation factors, C\u03b7eq (T ) are the\nequilibrium concentrations of the intrinsic defects, and\nD\u03b7 (T ) are the diffusion coefficients corresponding to\n\u03b7 = v, i, ex. The concentrations and diffusion coefficients\nare expressed in terms of their thermodynamic quantities,\n\"\n#\n#\n\"\n\u2206Sf\u03b7\n\u2206Ef\u03b7\neq\nC\u03b7 (T ) = exp\n(2)\nexp \u2212\nkB\nkB T\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n\u2206Em\n\u2206Sm\n(3)\nexp \u2212\nD\u03b7 (T ) = Km exp\nkB\nkB T\nwhere \u2206Sf\u03b7 and \u2206Ef\u03b7 are the entropy and energy of for\u03b7\n\u03b7\nmation, \u2206Sm\nand \u2206Em\nare the entropy and energy of\nmigration, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and Km is a\nconstant prefactor. The constant Km is independent of\ntemperature and depends on the lattice geometry and the\nvibrational frequencies. The entropy terms include both\nthe configurational and the vibrational entropies. The\nenergy of formation is determined by the atomic bonding at the defect site and the energy of migration is determined by the energy of the saddle point configuration\n\n\f2\nTABLE I: The energies of formation and migration for vacancies and interstitial defects in Si and Ge.\nElement\nSi\n\nGe\n\n\u2206Efv\n3.1\u20133.613\n3.718\n3.4920\n3.5322\n2.323\n1.7\u20132.027\n2.425\n2.629\n2.5631\n\n\u2206Efi\n3.216\n3.31\u20133.8419\n3.2721\n\nv\n\u2206Em\n0.4\u20131.4013\n0.43\u20130.4912\n\ni\n\u2206Em\n17\n0.45\n0.8412\n\n2.2924\n2.3\u20134.128\n3.5530\n3.5031\n\n0.725\n0.36\u20130.729\n\n0.526\n\nalong the minimum energy transition path between stable atomic configurations.\nDirect exchange is the slowest diffusion mechanism.\nStraining the lattice to allow the atoms to move past each\nother requires a prohibitively large amount of energy.\nThe principal diffusion pathways involve either vacancy\nor interstitial assisted migration. The work presented\nhere focuses on these intrinsic point defects. Based on the\nenergies listed in TABLE I the self-diffusion coefficient\nin Si is controlled by a self-interstitial kick-out mechanism at high temperatures (T > 900\u25e6 C) and vacancymediated diffusion at lower temperatures.13\nIn Ge, vacancy-assisted diffusion is the primary\nmode.14 Although the migration barrier for Ge vacancies and self-interstitials is roughly equivalent, the energy\nof formation for interstitial Ge atoms is approximately\n1 eV greater than vacancies, whereas in Si the energy\nto create vacancies and interstitials is equivalent. In Ge\nself-interstitial atoms will only be formed at very high\ntemperatures or after highly energetic processes such as\nirradiation.15 Therefore, vacancies in Ge are substantially\nmore influential than interstitial atoms for assisting diffusion under thermal equilibrium, as compared to Si.\nThe dominance of vacancies-assisted diffusion is observed experimentally, both for self-diffusion32 and\nimpurity-atom diffusion.14,33,34 The interaction between\nvacancies and impurity atoms is complicated. It is believed that vacancies and impurities form mobile defect\npairs.28,35,36 This defect pair can become pinned when a\nsecond impurity, such as C, joins the complex.28 In addition to forming complexes, the vacancies and impurities\noften carry a charge.23,28,35 It is likely that an isolated vacancy in bulk Ge is charged \u22122.35 In the work presented\nhere only isolated, charge neutral, impurities are investigated, which is consistent with the nanoscale context of\nthis study.\nTo improve the engineering control of material properties and increase device efficiency, it is desirable to\nmove from bulk to nanoscale structures. There are many\nexamples of situations where nanostructured Ge offers\nbenefits. The use of Ge nanocrystals as the floating\ngate of MOS memory devices results in a dramatic shift\nin the threshold-voltage, improved switching character-\n\nistics, and decreased leakage current.37,38 Ge films with\nnanostructured surfaces offer the ability to tune the optical properties of thin films.39 Ge nanowires are considered\nfor use as MOSFETs.40,41\nUltimately the nanostructures used to create devices\nneed to be tailored by controlling their size, surfaces,\nand dopants. With respect to introducing dopants, the\nelectronic properties of nanostructures are believed to\nbe sensitive to the relative position of the impurities in\nthe structure. The mean free path of charge carriers\nwithin nanowires depends strongly on the radial dopant\nprofile.42 This will influence the conductivity. In addition\nto the challenge of selectively incorporating the dopant\natoms into the nanostructure, the impurity distribution\nmust be maintained for the lifetime of the device.\nAt the quantum scale the primary difference between\na bulk crystal and a nanocrystal is the interaction of\nthe wave function with the surfaces. As the size of a\nstructure decreases, the crystal's translational symmetry\nceases to be meaningful. The electronic band-structure\nthat is nominally a function of the quantum number k is\nprojected onto the \u0393 point in the center of the Brillouin\nzone. The crystal's energy bands become discrete quantum energy states. Whereas in bulk the wave function\nis distributed across the entire crystal as Bloch waves,\nuk (r) eik.r , in nanocrystals the wave function is confined\nby the surfaces. The size of the nanostructure directly\nimpacts the energy states, analogous to the elementary\nparticle-in-a-box problem. Consider for example a [110]\nGe nanowire. When the wire diameter is sufficiently\nsmall the crystal's translational symmetry is only meaningful in the [110] direction and the bulk Ge states are\nprojected along the k = [110] direction in k-space. This\nprojection transforms Ge from an indirect to direct band\ngap material.43 The confinement is predicted to distort\nthe shape of the energy dispersion for wires with diameters as large as 2 nm. The energy bands of nanowires\nwith diameter greater than 2 nm are found to undergo a\nrigid shift, even for wires as large as 5 nm.43\nFundamentally, there are two effects that differentiate the behavior of defects in nanostructures from bulk:\nquantum confinement and free surfaces. Dalpian44 claims\nthat the confinement of the defect's wave function results\nin the so-called self-purification effect that increases the\ndefect's \u2206Ef\u03b7 . In the case of dopant species, this increase\nhinders the incorporation of dopant atoms into the nanostructures. This is a controversial subject and worthwhile\ninvestigating.45\u201347 In the present calculations evidence of\nself-purification will be sought.\nThe free surfaces allow the nanostructure to expand or\ncontract to reduce the strain energy surrounding the defect. From an energetics perspective the self-purification\neffect and the free surfaces compete with one another.\nThe self-purification increases the energy and the free\nsurfaces decrease the energy. From a kinetics perspective\nthey complement one another because it is likely that\nthe surfaces will getter impurities out of the nanostructure. In the case of Si nanocrystals it is observed that\n\n\f3\nthe relative energy to introduce vacancies decreases as\nthe nanocrystal's size decreases. This indicates that energetically the free surfaces dominate the self-purification\neffect.48 As the vacancy is moved toward the surface the\nenergy further decreases and when the vacancy is within\n0.6 \u00c5 of the surface it becomes unstable and is spontaneously moved to the surface of the crystal.48,49\nIn this paper the structure and energies of vacancies\nin Ge nanocrystals are examined as a function of the\nnanocrystal's size and the position of the vacancy in the\ncrystal. Because the energies, \u2206Ef\u03b7 , depend on the size\nof the crystal and the position within the crystal, the\nconcentrations and diffusivities, from EQ. 2 and 3, also\ndepend on the size and position. Self-diffusion within\nnanostructures is not a simple matter that can be easily\ndescribed by a single coefficient. The work here is a first\nstep toward building a comprehensive model.\nFollowing this introduction, in Sec. II, the methods\nused will be presented, including a discussion of the computational approach and the details of the nanocrystals'\nmorphology. The results from these calculations will be\npresented and discussed in Sec. III. A concluding summary will be presented in Sec. IV.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nMETHODS\n\nComputational approach\n\nThe calculations are performed within the framework of the density-functional theory50 (DFT), using the\nlocal-density approximation51 (LDA) for the exchangecorrelation functional, as it is implemented in the Siesta\ncomputational package.52 The electrons in the core\natomic region are substituted by norm-conserving pseudopotentials of the Troullier-Martins type,53 and the valence charge is represented by a set of atom-centered basis functions. In Siesta these functions correspond to\nnumerical atomic orbitals of strictly finite range, a particular choice that is specially suited to treat isolated\nsystems.\nAll calculations are carried out using a double-\u03b6 plus\npolarization orbitals (DZP) basis set. The cutoff radii of\nthe basis functions are optimized for bulk germanium in\nthe diamond structure, following the method proposed\nin Ref. [54], where a fictitious external pressure of 0.2\nGPa is employed on the free atom. This basis size and\nradius lengths are proven to give a good balance between\nthe computational accuracy and cost. A theoretical lattice parameter of a0 = 5.64 \u00c5 and a bulk modulus of\nB0 = 80.0 GPa, are obtained from the fitting to the\nMurnaghan equation of state.55 Both values are in good\nagreement with the structural and elastic properties from\nexperiments56 (\u00e30 = 5.66 \u00c5 and B\u03030 = 75.8 GPa), given\nthe fact that the LDA tends to underestimate lattice constants by a 1\u20133%, but also to overestimate bulk moduli\nwith errors ranging from 5 up to 20%.57\nThe theoretical method employs periodic boundary\n\nTABLE II: The local bond lengths at a vacancy site in crystals\nwith diameters 1.02 and 2.20 nm. The segment labels reference the tetrahedral structure in FIG. 2.

The nanocrystals are placed inside the supercell surrounded by a buffer of empty space. The size\nof the atomic clusters ranges from 44 to 244 Ge atoms\nand the vacuum region is chosen to be large enough as\nto avoid any interaction between their periodic replicas.\nA kinetic energy cutoff of 250 Rydberg is chosen for\nthe real-space integrations involving the Hartree and the\nexchange-correlation contributions to the self-consistent\npotential. In this respect, a stringent criterion is employed in the convergence of the density matrix and total\nenergy. All atomic coordinates are then relaxed according to a conjugate-gradient minimization algorithm, until\nthe maximum residual forces are below 0.02 eV/\u00c5.\n\nB.\n\nNanocrystal morphology\n\nThe nanocrystal geometries used in these studies\nare hydrogen passivated, bond-centered crystals. Experimental nanostructures frequently have amorphous,\nglassy, or polymeric coatings that result from the method\nof crystal growth. It is possible to treat the surfaces to\nreduce or remove these, although it is uncommon experimentally to work with bare surfaces. The nanocrystals\ninvestigated here have their surfaces passivated with a\nextremely \"soft\" H pseudopotential. Surface passivation\nremoves surface states and allows the competition between the self-purification effect and the free surfaces to\nbe studied without considering the complicated surface\nchemistry.\nSurface Ge atoms are identified and the dangling bonds\nof the Ge atoms are capped with H. Any Ge atom that is\nfound to have three dangling bonds is replaced by a single\nH atom. The resulting nanocrystals are shown in FIG.\n1. The surface morphologies are examined and crystals\nthat are highly faceted are excluded. Only nanocrystals\nwith near spherical geometry are studied.\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) Ge nanocrystal morphology for (a) Ge44 H42 , (b) Ge130 H98 , and (c) Ge244 H158 . The corresponding sizes\nare 1.02, 1.70 and 2.20 nm respectively. A central vacancy is depicted as a hatched atom surrounded by four missing bonds\n(broken lines), all in red.

The dashed circle is the vacancy and the\nsolid circles are the nearest neighbor Ge atoms that form a\ntetrahedron. The tetrahedron, without atomic motion has\nTd symmetry. The calculated bond lengths for various sized\nnanocrystals are shown in TABLE II.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nAtomic structure and defect states\n\nThe local atomic structure at the vacancy site is directly related to the electronic states introduced to the\ngap from the broken bonds. The atomic structure of the\nvacancy in the 1.02 and 2.20 nm nanocrystals is given in\nTABLE II, using as reference the ABCD indices shown in\nFIG. 2. The associated electronic states are diagrammed\nin FIG. 3. The left column of FIG. 3 shows the states\nfor a nanocrystal with no vacancy. The band gap for the\n1.02 nm crystal is 3.13 eV and the gap for the 2.20 nm\ncrystal is 2.0 eV.\n\nAn undistorted vacancy has Td symmetry. There are\nthree degenerate states in the gap, belonging to the t2\nrepresentation, associated with this structure. These are\nshown in the middle column of FIG. 3. There are two\nelectrons localized at the defect so the states are partially occupied. It is the partial occupancy of the degenerate energy levels that allows the defect to undergo a\nspontaneous symmetry breaking that reduces the degeneracy and lowers the electronic energy. In bulk crystals\nthe Jahn-Teller distortion produces a D2d symmetrized\nstructure with the fully-occupied state belonging to the\nb2 representation and the doubly-degenerate, empty state\nhaving the e representation.48,58,59\nHere, as in the case of a vacancy in a Si nanocrystal,48\nthe symmetry of the structure approaches D2d but due to\nthe surfaces there is additional distortion. In the case of\nthe 1.02 nm crystal, the symmetry of the vacancy structure is Cs . For the 2.20 nm crystal the symmetry is\nessentially D2d but a minuscule 0.01 nm distortion of the\nbonds lowers the symmetry, i.e., if AC=AD=BC=BD\nthen the symmetry would be D2d . From TABLE II it\nis determined that the Jahn-Teller distortion in the 1.02\nnm crystal is approximately 10% larger than that in the\n2.20 nm crystal and as a result the defect states undergo\na larger energy split, over 2.7 eV, which almost pushes\nthe states out of the gap. In the 2.20 nm crystal the\nsplitting is much smaller, around 0.75 eV.\n\nB.\n\nCrystal size\n\nThe energy of the fully optimized vacancy structures in\nthe different sized nanocrystals is calculated. Subtracting this energy from the energy of the perfect nanocrystals yields the energy of formation for a vacancy plus\nthe chemical potential for Ge, i.e., the energy to remove\na Ge atom from the system. The chemical potential is\nvariable and depends on the local chemical environment.\n\n\fPerfect Crystal\n\nVacancy\nNo Relaxation\n\nVacancy\nJahn-Teller\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n1.5\n\n(a)\n\n1\n0.5\n\n3.5\n\n1\n\nBand gap (eV)\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\n3\n\nEnergy of formation (eV)\n\n5\n\n0\n-1\n\n3\n2.5\n\n(b)\n\n2\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\nDiameter (nm)\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n-2\n\nD=1.02 nm\n4\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\n3\n\nFIG. 4: The relative energy of formation for a vacancy in\ndifferent sized nanocrystals is plotted in frame (a).

The red dashed line is the Fermi energy. The band\nalignment between the diagrams is arbitrary. The crystals\nin the left column are perfect and contain no vacancy. The\ncrystals in the center column have vacancies, but the structure has not been allowed to relax. The states at the Fermi\nlevel are three-fold degenerate. The right column shows the\nstates after the Jahn-Teller distortion is completed, which allows the atomic structure to break the symmetry and lift the\ndegeneracy of the gap state.\n\nBy assuming that all the nanocrystals are located in the\nsame environment and have the same chemical potential\nit is possible to compare the relative energy of formation\nfor vacancies in different sized nanocrystals. It is known\nthat as a nanocrystal's diameter approaches infinity the\nenergy of formation approaches that found in bulk Ge.\nUsing this energy limit the calculated energy of formation versus crystal diameter is plotted in FIG. 4(a). It is\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 are fitting coefficients. In the limit\nthat the diameter, D, goes to infinity, the energy equals\n\u03b3. The coefficients are determined to be \u03b1 = \u22121.1395 and\n\u03b2 = 6.2574. The energy zero is shifted so that \u03b3 = 2.0\neV, which is taken from the energies reported in TABLE\nI. The quality of this fit appears good. It is observed that\nthe energy of formation is near the bulk value for crystals\nas small as 2.0 nm. This is surprising because quantum\nconfinement continues to strongly influence the band gap\nfor crystals with a similar size, as shown in FIG. 4(b).\n\nC.\n\nDistance from crystal center\n\nTo determine the influence of a vacancy's position on\nits energy a 2.20 nm crystal (Ge244 H158 ) is examined with\na vacancy at various locations within it. The calculated\nenergies are shown in FIG. 5. The configuration where\nthe vacancy is adjacent to the center of the crystal [FIG.\n1(c)] is defined as the zero. Near the center of the crystal\nthere is little change in the energy, but once the vacancy\nis within 0.7 nm of the surface it begins to drop substantially. The last stable vacancy site is 0.3 nm from the\nsurface. The energy of a vacancy at this site is a full 1.2\neV less than a vacancy near the center. From the results\nin Sec. III B it is known that the energy of formation in\nthe center of the 2.20 nm crystal is almost that observed\nin bulk or slightly smaller. Using the energies in TABLE\nI it is deduced that the energy of formation for the vacancies near the surface can be no larger than 0.5 to 1.4\neV.\n\n\f6\nVacancy energy versus position\n22 \u00c5 Ge nanocrystal\n\nRelative energy (eV)\n\n0\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.8\n\n-1.2\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n6\nDistance from center (\u00c5)\n\n8\n\nFIG. 5: The relative energy of a vacancy in a 2.20 nm Ge\nnanocrystal (Ge244 H158 ).

The Td symmetrized broken bonds located\nat the vacancy introduce a set of three-fold degenerate,\npartially-occupied, states in the gap. When these dangling bonds reconstruct the defect symmetry is lowered.\nThis reduces the degeneracy of the defect states by splitting them into a lower-energy, fully-occupied state and\ntwo higher-energy, degenerate empty states. In a bulk\ncrystal it is known that the symmetry of the vacancy site\nis D2d ,58 but in the nanocrystals the surfaces introduce\nadditional distortion. For the smallest crystal the surface\ninfluence is great; the defect symmetry is Cs and the energy splitting is approximately 2.7 eV. This results in a\ndramatic reduction in energy of formation. In the 2.20\nnm crystal the defect almost has the D2d symmetry that\nis found in bulk. The energy splitting is also smaller than\nthat in the 1.02 nm crystal, only around 0.75 eV; therefore, the energy reduction due to the bond reconstruction\nis lower and the energy of formation is larger in the 2.20\nnm crystal. This is consistent with the calculated prediction that the energy of formation will approach the bulk\nvalue for nanocrystals larger than 2.0 nm.\nThe band gap of the crystal continues to change greatly\n\n\u2217\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nElectronic address: sbeckman@iastate.edu\nP.\nY.\nYu\nand\nM.\nCardona,\nFundamentals of Semiconductors (Springer, New York,\n2001), 3rd ed.\nC.

It is deduced\nthat although quantum confinement continues to impact\nthe energy levels in the crystal, the primary influence on\nthe vacancy is the surface's ability to enhance the internal\nstructural relaxation. It is concluded that in this example\nthe quantum self-purification effect plays a small role if\nany. A similar observation has been made for vacancies\nin Si.48 It is hypothesized that this is due to the defect's\nwave function being highly localized at the reconstruction\nbonds.\nFinally, it is determined that vacancies placed within\n0.7 nm of the surface are spontaneously removed. Surprisingly vacancies in the interior of the crystal are stable\nand do not appear to be drawn toward the exterior. An\nadditional consequence is that if a surface were to act as\na vacancy source, the vacancies produced from the surface are unlikely to penetrate deeply into the nanocrystal. The system studied here has H-passivated surfaces,\nwhich allows for large relaxations. Experimental crystals\nthat have surface reconstructions or polymer coatings will\nhave more rigidity and the influence of the surfaces will\nbe further muted inside the crystal.\nThe picture that emerges from this work is that moderate sized crystals will have an interior where vacancies\nbehave bulk-like and a thin exterior surface region where\nthe surface effects will dominate. Assuming that the\nproperties of the self-interstitial defect are not strongly\nmodified by the surfaces, then the evidence in this paper predicts that the self-diffusion in the interior of Ge\nnanocrystals will not be substantially different from that\nobserved in bulk. However, recent experiments indicate\nthat Ge surfaces are not sinks for interstitial atoms, but\ninstead reflect the interstitial Ge back into the crystal.15\nIf this observation holds within the nano-regime then\nit is possible that the large surface to volume ratio in\nnanostructures will magnify the impact of the interstitialassisted diffusion.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge support from the\nNational Science Foundation DMR-0755231.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nJ.
